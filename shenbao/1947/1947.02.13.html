<h3>穩定金鈔物價方案　最近期內卽可實施　主席召集各方舉行會議</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕國防最高委會定十四日九時召開臨時會議，討論平抑物價，安定民生諸問題。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕蔣主席十一日午於官邸召見宋子文，俞鴻鈞，王雲五，蕭錚，黃伯度等，垂詢當前金融，財政各情，指示儘速擬定平抑物價，安定民生方案，速予實施，此事將由經部主持，並決定電召吳國楨，吳開先，束雲軍，及滬燃料管理委會負責人來京日內開會，儘最短期內決定方案，即佬實施。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕宋子文十二日晨在寓邸接見即晨抵京之貝祖詒，聽取滬上金融動盪實况，至十時召見俞鴻鈞與財部美籍顧問與貝祖詒等舉行會議，商討對策，至午始散。午後續有徐柏園等前往謁商，聞此項對策，將由宋氏即夜赴滬後，視滬市實况再作最後決定。據聞宋於午後曾謁見主席，報告此項對策。又貝祖詒定十二日夜隨宋返滬。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕據曾參加十一日宋子文召開之臨時會議之某要員談：平抑物價方案，正由各有關方面分別研討中，不久即可提出。各要員日內將繼續會商。記者詢以是否將設新機構處理此事，渠答：如有需要，可能成立一機構。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕當局對平抑此次金融波動之有效辦法，已有具體決定，十二日上午宋院長官邸有重要會談，俞部長鴻鈞，央行總裁貝祖詒均參加。此項有效辦法，日內即可付諸實施，黃金，美鈔勢將再跌。</p>
<p>中常會決議設立經濟政策研究會</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕中常會十二日上午九時召開例會，出席中常委三十餘人，蔣總裁親臨主持。宋子文因同時在寓邸與貝祖詒等會談，未能出席。首討論各例案，通過中央選舉指導委員會組織法等，次由總裁垂詢近日金鈔風潮及物價波動各情形，并徵詢意見，當指示政府　懷民生，已定有適當措施，決可設法平抑，旋由潘常委委展，報告上海金融市塲及若隱若現之操縱因素，并陳述意見，决由劉健羣，賴璉，賀衷寒等相繼發言。最後決定對當前經濟政策，重予檢討，并擬即由中央組織一委員會，由中委七八人任委員，儘速成立，決定方策，十一時散會。另訊；中央擬設立之經濟政策研究委會，除由中央指派若干中委祖任委員外，并將延請工商界名宿加入。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕據政府某要員談：目前金潮洶湧，致引起物價之普遍上漲，政府對此極為注意，頃正覓妥當辦法，擬使黃金與物價分離，使其失却連繫作用。至外傳政府將採黃金收歸國有及黃金停止買賣辦法，前者立院方面已有此建議，後者則頗有可能。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十二日電〕官方人士今夜聲稱：政府已決定停止美鈔流通，及限制黃金公開交易，是項決策，一俟蔣主席核准，即予實行。至於昨日立法院會議時，若干委員提議黃金國有計劃，則不能施行。</p>
<h3>依據歷年生活指數　物價可自然平抑　某經濟主管分析物價談話</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕某經濟主管十二日晨對記者分析當前物價問題時，其所持見解，並不如一般之悲觀。渠舉出具體數字，說朋目前物價雖漲，然最後終必走上合理途徑。據稱：據若干年來物價指數統計，每年物價平均漲二倍七，「七七」事變迄今，前後共歷九載，當時價値一元之貨物，目前應値七千八百十一元。（即二倍七之九次方）戰前京滬一帶米價，每擔十二元，乘以七千八百倍，應値九萬三千元。金價每兩一百十五元，應値八十九萬七，目前物價飛漲，在若干方面，並未超出多多，且根據歷年經騐，每年二三月物價必漲，至五六月後漲勢即殺，此種現象可以歷年物價指數表所指示之曲錢作證，過一時期後，物價必可自然平抑。渠繼分析物價對名陸層生活所起之影饗，指出當時工人，每日可得八角至一元（一日斗米），而目前所得，己不祗斗米，農民確有種種痛苦，然究有實物。</p>
<h3>京金鈔下瀉</h3>
<p>黃金每兩落廿萬元</p>
<p>美鈔相差五十萬元</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕首都金價十一日一日之中扶搖直上，大有破百萬大關而上之勢，然迄晚歇市時，已略吳疲象，因當局為過止漲風，將採取緊急措施，投機者心虛手軟，乃相率拋售，金價自此即如洪流下瀉，十二日淸晨開盤時，尙有以九五掛出者，惟旋即以滬電報傳滬價告軟，而即時下落九時許出為七十九萬五，進七十四萬，一小時後復上揚，計出八十二萬五，進七十五萬五，十一時許又告下落，出七十六萬五，進六十九萬五，十二時出七十四萬五，進六十七萬五，下午一時出七十一萬五，進六十四萬五，至晚續有升落，至收盤時出價六十八萬，進六十四萬。洶湧之金風，因此乃漸殺低，惟因金風而掀起之物價上漲，業已不能下跌，如米糧之上漲，己呈不能回平之狀。據開政府即將採取有效辦法，短期內如能付諸實施，則物價當可轉平。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕黃金美鈔市價突跌，十二日晨黃金每兩出七十一萬五千元，進六十四萬五千元，與十一日每兩九十一萬五千元，相差達廿萬元之鉅，美鈔跌風更巨，十二日百元進價一百十萬元，出一百廿萬元，較十一日每百元出一百七十萬元者相差五十萬元。</p>
<h3>政府將採取必要步驟　應付當前經濟情勢　彭部長於記者會上談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕中央宣傳部十二日下午四時舉行記者招待會，彭部長答復記者重要詢問如下：</p>
<p>問：美元在華兌換價值之劇高漲原因何在？是否在計劃控制之法，此辦法如何</p>
<p>答：政府桷有把握足以應付經濟情勢，當趨續採取各種必要步驟，唯目前經濟局面，為八年抗戰與兩年來有加無已中共破壞之結果，國人現已漸决明瞭，彼肆意破壞，交通工礦者所應負之責任，對此種貧血狀態，吾人決不可稍存幻想，以為更改貨幣名稱或匯率或稅率，即可收意外奇效，唯有及早恢復經濟建設，嚴守勤勞與節的之信條，庶為根本療治。</p>
<p>改組政府</p>
<p>問：改組政府，給少數黨派以何種比例之權力，完成改組，需要多少時問，改組之政府，何時可開始工作？</p>
<p>答：各黨派將商洽參加國民政府委會，立伕院，行政院，監察院與過渡時期之國民參政會及憲政實施促進會常務委會等，何日完成改組，尙難確言。</p>
<p>和平希望</p>
<p>問：國共衝突尙留有和平解決之希望吾？</p>
<p>答：在目前情形下，難言和平。蓋中共到處攻學國軍，其一部份目的，在國際宣傳與激勵其屢遭敗刦後之士氣，同時，盡其所能煽動工人罷工學生罷課，並發動所謂「排斥美貨運動」，「毀憲運動」等，務期造成國際糾紛與人心恐慌，唯西諺云：「木以火焚而毀，鐵以火煉而堅」，中國國軍，經此苦難之後，將益見健強，一如其經過抗戰之穢。</p>
<p>黃金政策</p>
<p>問：政府之黃金政策如何？中央銀行是否將繼續出售黃金？對於法定匯率之政策為何？將另採其他辦法以代替出口補助吾？</p>
<p>答：任何回答將不免於市塲有直接影響，故恕余不作討論。</p>
<p>張學良事</p>
<p>問：首謀西安事變之張學良政府將釋放否？答：張學良於民國廿五年年底，由軍委會高等軍法會審以首謀夥黨，對於上官為暴行脅迫，判處有期徒刑十年，嗣由蔣委員長呈請國民政府特赦，廿六年一月四日國府令准特赦，仍交軍委會嚴加管束，此偕出於蔣委長始終保全張氏與對其愛護之意。抗戰期間，張氏住居貴州，其眷屬常川同住，且不時往來，並未禁止。去年移住台北，其起居生活如常，惟在目前情勢下，國府尙未能取消管束之命。</p>

<h3>美關切我國經濟　對受貼補出口各種貨物　考慮免征附加稅可能性</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十二廣播：中國之出口津貼辦法，現因美方關稅規則而無法實現，美方正在攷慮補救方法，務使中國之幣制能因此趨於穩定。美政府等候美駐滬總領截維斯之報告，將於十三日作一決定。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十一日電〕國務院發言人稱，中國經濟危機益深，美政府日漸關切。國務院對於中國方面一切發展，正正密切注意，不斷由駐華大使館及駐滬總領事接獲報告，但於此項報告之性質不願宣布。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十二日電〕美政府人士今日聲稱，美國一九三〇年關稅決議，使中國補助出口業計劃大受打擊，美方現已攷慮取消此決議之可能性。但此舉對於阻止通貨膨脹，將有多大帮助，頗成問題。駐上海美總領事戴維斯，或將於十三日公布美財政部之決定辦法。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十一日電〕擄可靠方面政府人員稱，此間許多政府人員對於受中國政府津貼之中國出口商，認為應免徽一九三〇年關稅法所規定之附加稅，據稱：美財政部將於廿四小時之內決定應吾予以免微附加稅。若干官員已明白要求政府免徵中國貨物之附加稅，且美國在過去辦經濟拮据之盟國，亦曾免徽附加稅，殊有前例可援。彼等並認為，此舉足可改善上海目前之嚴重經濟危機。其他官員雖堅持如未經國會特別批准，一九三〇年關稅法不得任意破壞，但彼等亦認為，假如中國政府所以津貼其出口商，并非眞正之津貼，而為變相之外匯調整，則確有免徵附加稅之可能。</p>
<p>美政府若千部門之官員，昨晚及今晨曾再度商討此一問題，但不願預言其結果。該問題最後將由財政部及聯邦準備銀行決定之，主張免徽附加稅者并稱，為早日恢復中國出口商舉，而安定中國經濟局勢起見，目前採取此項辦法尙非過　，但如不能早日決定，則為時已晚。</p>

<p>〔本報北平十二日電〕葉劍英今日出席共產黨新聞處招待記者會，向平記者羣告別。葉曾以共產黨觀點對記者剖析戰局政局，大致言之，渠認為徐州決定勝負戰役，因雙力指揮官視當時情勢，可決戰，可速戰決，亦可作持久戰也。論及政局時稱：經過二月三月兩月後，軍事改觀，和平亦可望重新建立。記者詢以共產黨是否必欲恢復去年一月十三日軍事位置而後己，若必欲則在軍事力量上是否有達成目的之把握，抑將用間接方法以完成？葉答：「去年一月十三日午夜軍事位置，可以說有這個位置，也可以說沒有這個位置，當然我們可以在地圖勾劃出這個位置圖來，但是如果兩黨果能建立政治諒解，國民黨同意這一個條件，那麼共產黨使不一定非要實現這個條件不可，那麼所謂一月十三日軍事立置，也就沒用了」。關於軍調部一年工作，渠將發表一聲明，現正與延安洽商內容。</p>
<p>李登輝主張和平　謂當前須無條件停戰</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕七十五歲高齡，從事敎育五十年，素不問外事之李登輝博士，現為和平運動五召集人之一。際此金融紊亂，物價狂漲，人心極度不安之時，記者訪問李博士於其住宅，承其接見，問答如下：</p>
<p>問：近日物價在漲人心異常不安，先生有何意見？</p>
<p>答：國家情况至此，實屬嚴重萬令，如不由根本解決，亦無辦法，余以為一切問題繫於和平，欲安定金融，必須由實現和平開始。</p>
<p>問：除實現和平外，尙有無其他方法？</p>
<p>答：萬事須由和平始。</p>
<p>問：先生等發起和平運動之動機如何？</p>
<p>答：余以為今日中國，加無和平，一切無從談起，數月以前，余即欲以國民資格，作此呼籲，近與友好及同學多人，暨工商界領袖談及均人同此心，乃共同發起此一救國運動；余以為抗戰以來，尙無一全國性之救國運動，合乎全民族之迫切需要為和平運動者。</p>
<p>問：和平運動目標如何？</p>
<p>答：立即無條件停戰。</p>
<p>問：和平運動除輿論呼籲外，尙有其他有效方法否？</p>
<p>答：八年抗聯歷史說明，一旦全國意志良心集中於一個單純目標之時，其力量足以超過世界任何有形之力量，如大多數一致要求和平，不與戰爭以鼓勵，余信任何人不能不服從和平。</p>
<p>問：然則全國意志如何始能集中於和平乎？</p>
<p>答：如毫無偏袒，除和平外，絕無目的，孰不人同此心，此即和平運動之目的。</p>

<p>答：無條件停職，是人民之要求，至雙方須如何條件，係雙方之事，彼等條件如何，吾人無意過問惟希望勿損及人民之公益耳</p>
<p>問：和平運動主張不問過去是非，有不以為然者，先生以為如何？</p>
<p>答：戰爭之時，一論是非，即有偏袒，吾人主張今日之是，即是和平，其他是非，可俟之停戰以後。</p>
<p>問：外間對和平運動頗有揣測，先生有所聞吾？</p>
<p>答：閣下但問和平是否需要，並候事實之證明。</p>
<p>問：先生等有意斡旋和平乎？</p>
<p>答：吾人今日係拘國人之良心呼籲，尙未向作戰雙方呼籲。</p>
<p>問：和平運動不歡迎其他黨派參加乎？</p>
<p>答：此不盡然，吾人不問黨派，但問是否贊成和平宣言，一切黨派之自由分子，而有職業者，以和平為第一目標，不受黨派意見拘束者，吾人均歡迎參加。</p>
<p>問：先生對此運動前途如何觀察？</p>
<p>答：余深信和平運動必能成功至此先生以誠摯之語調，送記者出門時云：「余老矣，惟望勝利以後，得見一和平康盛之中國，余深盼較余年靑之朋友，除自己之職業外，一致以和平為最大之目標，早日促其實現，則諸君享受和平之幸福與光榮之時日，當較余更為多多矣」。</p>

<h3>丁逆默邨判決理由原文　續昨</h3>
<p>純託空言</p>
<p>且被告於民國廿七年底抵滬後，二三星期，即與李士羣發生關係（見本院三十五年十一月十九日筆錄，由此益信前軍委會調查統計局卅五年十月廿二日第四七三一號公兩所稱：「丁默邨任偽特丁總部主任，自廿八年春至廿九年三月」為真實。被告自稱係自廿八年秋，始參加特工，顯難置信，雖被告以未允胡均鶴隨同赴浙工作有仇，乃虛構事實為癖解，然查純係空言，未足採證。至被告所呈趙冰谷卅五年十一月廿五日及蔣伯誠卅五年十一月七日之函件，證明七十六號常時由李士羣吳世實等操縱作惡各節，惟查蔣伯誠係得諸傳聞（見其卅五年十二月九日覆兩），而趙冰谷亦非七十六號內幕中人，自無　知悉，此種證明，當難採信，况據　　如之弟　南陽供述：民國廿八年三月，丁默邨曾對　　　說，「你父會任高二分院檢察官，為何不參加和運，如堅不參加和運，七十六號要你父生命。」同年十一月間，郁華果被七十六號所書後，丁逆對我姐說「殺　給猴子看看」云云（見上海高等法院卅五年十二月十一日訊問筆錄），核與郁蔭所呈之各種報紙所載之當時情況吻合，是郁華之遭暗殺，顯見為丁逆默邨所主使。</p>
<p>證言難信</p>
<p>關於鄰蘋如之被殺害，據中國國民黨中央執行委員會關查統計局第五一六七號公函，足以證實屬蘋如之被捕遇害，與誘殺丁逆默邨敗露有因果關係，被告當時旣係七十六號負責之人，加以逮捕殺害，顯無疑義，被告諉為日寇之加書，其辯解殊無採證之價值。再軍統局被害之地下工作人員八名，遇書之地點，均在上海，遇善之日期，亦在被告任偽特工總部主任時期內，且經該局兩證明確，殊難容被告之狡賴，且有偽中央日報社卅三年新歲特輯可憑，證據確鑿，顧實衡伍澄宇均曾參加偽組織，其證言固難置信，縱即認為真實，亦不足證明該文為偽宣傳部代撰，擅以被告之名發表，此種辯解，自亦不足採信。</p>
<p>關於第三點：查中國國民黨浙江省執行委員會民國卅五年十二月十七日信字第二三五號公函，有公文書之效力，被告旣未提出確切及證明其為不實，且核與當時其他個省政府偽省黨部所有情形相符合，當推定其為真確。關於第四點，查據程恭澍之報告，偽突擊總隊曾在淞江與紹興兩地，發現其淞江部份因未與當地敵軍聯絡，以致潰散，其紹興部份，在日本投降後，已分散或反正，足證被告所稱，「該突擊總隊」以經費等項無着迄未成立」並非真實，至被告組織突擊總隊之目的，全國在浙東沿海盟軍登陸後，作游擊戰，亦有程恭澍之報告堪證。至其所稱以備迎合中央反攻，純係空言，豈堪採證。</p>
<p>總核被告辯解所持之理由，無一能成立，是被告通謀敵國圖謀反抗本國，已無可掩飾，應負懲治漢奸條例第二條第一項第一款之罪實，雖其犯有罪行多端，然均出於同一「通敵謀反」之意思，吸收於同一之漢奸罪中，母庸分別論科。（未完待續）</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>中國對外關係的低潮</h3>
<p>— 董霖</p>
<p>抗戰勝利以還，我們坐失了和平統一的機會，空談了一年多，在野黨猶未與中央合作，全國一致的政府尙未組成，加上爭地盤，打內戰，不但國內的政治經濟陷於癱瘓狀態，時至今日，我們已經落在對外關係的低潮中了。</p>
<p>這次世界大戰，中國在遠東方面獨任艱鉅，雖然在軍事上屢經挫敗，不過長期牽制着日本大部的兵力，使得美國有喘息的機會，可以整軍東征。各國認淸中國在這次戰爭的貢獻，所以國際地位蒸蒸日上；由次殖民地而一躍為四強之一。回想在美國頓巴頓橡樹會議的時候，法國的國勢還很衰微，因為牠在歐洲傳統的地理關係，後來被列入強國之林；可是位居第五。不幸我們不能把握時機，一年多內戰的結果，把四強之一的寳椅丟掉。反之，法國則奮發圖強，迎頭趕上，代替了中國的地位。現在報章所載四強是指美英蘇法，很少再用五強的名辭；甚至有時看到「四強和中國」的字句，這是多麼令人感傷的事！倫敦五外長會議開到中間，蘇聯忽對中國參加討論歐局發生異議，後來巴黎和會，中國未能列為邀請國之一；行將在莫斯科舉行的四外長會議，中國復無參加的機會。雖說中國因為沒有對德意等國實際作戰，所以不能祖任討論歐洲和的的重要責任；但推其內在的原因，還不是因為我們內部不爭氣，减輕了國際政治上發言的力量嗎？近幾年來，中國國際地位的演變，眞是令人不寒而慄。今再分析各國和我們的關係，則更有「失道寡助」之戚了！中國從抗戰初期起一直到現在，始終受到美國的同情和援助，戰後國共問題鬧得自己不能解決，美國自告奮勇，派了馬歇爾將軍來華調處；費了一年多的時間，想盡各種方法，希望中國能够完成統一民主的國家。結果我們到底令人失望，跟着馬將軍的回國，美國的調處任務宣告結束；現在又宣布撤退駐華美軍。此固然不能說是美國對華政策的改變，但在目前似乎已採取了觀望的態度。</p>
<p>在遠東享有重大權益的英國，和我們的關係也很微渺。自從「九一八事變」起，英國因為和日本的同盟關係，對於我們在國聯的申訴，抱看消極的態度。後來因為美國的遠束政策日趨強硬，而日本的領土擴張熱頗有從大陸而展至南洋的跡象，英國於是加深對華的同情；可是實際的援助，比較很少。直至太平洋事變突發，中英敵愾同仇，盟誼轉趨密切。但因中英地理環境的不同，對於德日究應誰先擊敗的戰略，所見各異；且因個個自顧不暇，戰時互助之處並不甚多。這不是由於中英關係的淡薄，實因事勢使然，英可如何。戰後英國為歐洲問題所困，加以印度巴勒斯坦等問題處置棘手，對於中國頗有鞭長莫及之苦。不幸最近議會中突有對華干涉論的發生，給予我們很深的刺激。工黨議員林賽勳爵的怪論，不特抹殺了中英的友誼；而且蔑祖了我們的主權。林賽的偏見，固由於不成熟的觀察；且為各黨領袖所駁斥，但提醒了我們應該從速加強兩國間被此的瞭解。國際友誼不進則退，中英關係的現階段似還不够積極。</p>
<p>中蘇衣好條約的簽訂，中國承認外蒙獨立，給予蘇聯在旅大的特權。我們所以作此重大讓步的原因，實由於中蘇地壤相接，戰後東亞和平的確保，有賴兩國的密切諒解。但事到如今，大連始終未能接收；國人對於蘇聯的誠意，不無發生疑慮。論者認為蘇聯對華關係的冷淡，由於中美友誼的過於密切和國共問題的不得圓滿解決。美蘇兩國對於戰後問題每多爭執，因而懷疑美軍駐華以及調處工作；反映着中國親美遠蘇的政策，實則中國之親美確係事實，但親美未必速蘇；相反的，我們希望美蘇同為我友，無分軒輊。至於共產黨的參加政府，不是國民黨片面所可強求的；中蘇條約所建立的友誼關係，不論何黨執政均有維繫的義務。且前中蘇關係的如此疏淡，未免太令人失望了。</p>
<p>中法兩國在這次大戰中，同受東西主敵蹂躪的慘痛經騐；彼此該有互助復興的共同願望。越南被侵以後，中國曾不避艱險，出兵相助，戰後拱手還法，未作任何分外的要求，這點友情伕國上下應當領悟的。可是證於過去國際會議中的經騐，伕國對於我們合理的主張，常抱緘默，鮮有支持，這也許因為顧慮到本身的地位，難作左右之袒。不過最近西沙島事件，使我們不勝驚奇。西沙羣島之原屬我國，論者已多；不必多贅。法國竟然不顧事實，指為越南所屬；至今還爭辯不休，使中法傳統的友誼，遭受意外的打擊，眞是十分惋惜！</p>
<p>從一般國際地位而分析對美英蘇法的個別關係，充分顯示中國目前對外關係的苦悶；不過我門雖然苦悶，並不頹喪。我們的國際地位是經過長期血戰而爭得，旣非僥倖立致；也決不因為一時內政上的糾紛，而可任人於頃刻之間排擠奚落的。現在莫斯科行將舉行四國外長會議，我們要正告於美英蘇伕的，該會旣無中國參加，不應討論和中國直接或間接有關的議案。倘或有之，不時中國決不受其束縛，而且開了國際關係的惡例；無形中埋下了破壞和平的炸藥。我們相信中美的友誼始終誠摯無間，強盛的中國是遠東和平甚而是世界和平的安定力，中國面臨着經濟的危機，無疑的希望美國借款助我復興。英伕與中國並無根本利害衝突之點，希望都從遠處大處着想，加強彼此素有的友好關係。中蘇毗鄰，敦睦邦交應為共同的希望，不過國際友誼，不是片面可致的；希望大家採取步驟，實踐中蘇友好條約的基本精神。</p>
<p>縱觀歷史，各國國勢的盛衰，是波浪形的。而且在盛極必衰，衰極必盛的圈子中循環。中國現在多難，但多難正可興邦；我們也可從多難的環境中，測騐誰是眞正的朋友！</p>
<p>最後我們不要忘記一國必自伐而後人伐之」的古訓，目前對外關係的低潮，並非由於外交當局運用欠周，實在是因為我們內部太不爭氣，希望大家猛省團結，記着「兄弟閱牆外禦其禍」，一致奮起，把可愛的祖國從國際低潮中提救出來！</p>

<h3>本年徵兵嚴杜流弊　準備工作慎重進行　傅正謨司令在蘇州談話</h3>

<h3>過橋硬推車的惡習</h3>
<p>這裏筆者舉出一件與大衆市民有關而必須改革的事清；筆者是一個女性，每逢獨坐一輛三輪車經過蘇州河各橋時，我起先總是下車走幾步，到橋中再坐上車子，但每次當我不要小流民推車的時候，總要受到一種不應該　有的侮辱，有時他們竟破口亂罵　：「他媽的，不用推，吃不消啦，受不了啦……』，以後我為了避免這種侮辱只好讓他們推，可是給他一兩百塊錢，他仍是要嚕嘛的。若有男人同坐一車，那末這種麻煩就不會發生。有一次我親眼看見一個外國女子獨坐一輛三輪車，有兩個推車的扶着她的車子一面走一面笑（其實根本沒有推），到了橋當中，兩個人都同時向這個外國女子要錢，她當然不肯拿兩份的錢，於是兩個推車子的人一個在前面把車子攔着，一個在後面拉着，硬不肯放車子走，道個外國女子急到要哭了，那車夫站在車子旁邊一聲不饗，其他的人各走各的路。我因為自己是個女子，帮不了忙，所以我只好走了。昨天筆者更碰到一件忍無可忍的事情。二月四日下午三時半，我乘一輛三輪重由南面北過四川路權，一個推車的硬要推我的車，我無法阻止他，到橋中間的時候我給他兩百塊錢，他說：「兩百塊錢拿來做什麼好？別人都是一千五百地給。」我說：「沒有這規矩！」他立刻把兩百塊錢的鈔票向我的險上掉過來，再跑到車子後面去，他的手一放，車子正向下走，就在遭一剎那，猛然間該推車的將我的頭上的頭中連髮用力一扯，因為我的頭中打的雙結，所以頭中沒有被扯去，只是扯落來吊着在頸子上，可是頭髮是給他扯去了一把，痛楚異常。當時我打算下車子去抓他，可是看不見有警察，我知道交通警長不會離開崗位來抓他的，如果我自己追上去抓，恐怕會受到更不堪設楊的眼前韋，所以我忍痛地回家了，竊思這羣衣衫襤褸的人，　集在世界大都市——上海——交通要道，不但有碍觀瞻，並且阻塞交通，要請市政當局決心取締，假如當局認為取締有困難時，那末敲詐式的需索，甚至侮辱婦女，一定要嚴格禁止呀。（孟秀珍）</p>
<h3>戰時藝術考古大發現　大足縣唐宋石刻　價值彌高政府令加保護</h3>

<h3>美國務院軍部主張　普遍軍訓鞏固國防　馬歇爾將出席外委會力爭　兩院聯合小組委會討論新預算案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十二日廣播：美陸軍領袖今舉行秘密會議，決定將正規軍減至八十七萬五千人，但國會必須通過普遍軍訓一案。目前陸軍之計劃，將陸軍人數在七月一日時到達一百零七萬人。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十一日電〕共和參議員即參院外委會主席范登堡頃宣稱，馬歇爾國務卿定於本月十四日，出席參院外委會秘密會議，討論主題未便宣布。</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十二日電〕馬歇爾明日將出席參院外委會秘密會議，報告兵士素質對國防之重要性。馬歇爾與陸海軍部均認為美國之國防極為薄弱，故普遍軍訓對國家之實為必要，然國會已斷然加以反對，甚至將根本拒絕考慮本年度之軍訓計劃。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統極力主張軍訓計劃從速實現，認為軍隊有訓練有素之公民作後盾，可以較短時期內應命赴戰，實國防安全中所費最少之計劃。馬歇爾本人在任參謀總長時，已屢屢道及美國在平時必須有所準備，包括普遍軍訓在內。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十一日電〕美國會兩院聯合預算小組委會，今將杜魯門所提一九四八年會計年度三百七十五億美元之預算數，减去六十億元。小組會之提案尙須送交一百零二人之全體委會，作最後決定，小組委會將杜魯門所估計之一百十二億軍費預算，减去十七億五千萬，此事立受眾院軍委會主席格納之批評，認此乃危及國家安全。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十一日電〕杜魯門總統提出之本年度預算案約三百七十五億美元，今日由兩院預算委會表決減少六百億美元。如此减削預算，是否將損害國防，表決前曾引起激烈爭辯。預算之縮減引起陸軍參謀總長艾森豪威爾之迫切抗議，反對裁减軍費，聞艾　認爲軍費若有減低情事，將使國防計劃大受打擊，例如關閉若干軍營及停止陸軍工程隊之大宗活動等。</p>
<h3>對德和約討論程序　蘇代表變更立場　暗示將容許小國陳述意見　美蘇對奧國問題展開激辯</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十一日電〕蘇聯代表古賽夫頃暗示稱：關於小國參加德國和談一事，蘇聯今即將放棄其完全反對之策略，並吿各國外長代表稱：渠將於日內提出設立外長委員會特別會議之建議，以便進行協商。該委會承　國外長之命，將經常與各聯盟小國政府保持接觸，並爲傳達　强決議及各盟國對於和約建議之聯　機構。按古賽夫素所堅拒小國有發言之權，故今之表示殆爲首决容許小國有陳述意見之舉動。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十一日電〕四外决會議今晨討論對奧和的草案時，由英代表胡特主席，美代表即前奧境美軍總司令克拉克與蘇聯代表古賽夫對於消滅奧境日耳曼勢力一項問題，發生口頭上之爭執。先是克拉克將軍反對將某一項條款插入對奧和的內，此即規定奧國政府必須提供諾言，禁止奧境內一切泛日耳曼宣傳之條款是也。克拉克將軍宣稱，吾人應將若干義務加諸奧政府，俾防止其在經濟上或政治上與德國合併，本人對此亦深以爲然。但余意蘇聯所提建議，或將招致其千涉奧內政耳。至此蘇代表古賽夫立即起立，對於此種指斥表示强碰抗議。克拉克將軍繼又以美人民所享受之大自由，與蘇聯准許其人民之小自由互相對照。蘇代表古賽夫當即起立發言稱，四外决在討論各項問題時，對於彼此國家應保特忠實之態度。主席胡特觀於美蘇代表爭辯頗爲激烈，爲息事寗人起見，乃起立宣稱，兩位代表所會已失諸遠甚，余主張奧國問題應暫緩討論。最後四外决會議決定於本月十四日聽取南斯拉夫及奧地利代表之意見，　時兩　代　就奧　所　　　　，闡明意見，而由英代表加以答覆。奧國邊界問題，則定於十五日加以討論。</p>
<h3>義大利艦隊　將自動鑿沉說</h3>

<h3>歐洲和約簽字後　五國大鳴不平　義外長致牒盟國政府　聲明保留要求修改和約之權</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十二日電〕和約五個簽字國家今日向法外長皮杜爾提出不滿和的條文之意見書，要求轉達全體簽字國家。其中三國爲前軸心附庸國，即匈牙利，保加利亞與羅馬尼亞，另兩國爲盟國即希臘與南斯拉夫。匈保羅三國之抗議幾相一致，特別反對和的之經濟條文。匈國並爲捷克境內之匈少數民族呼冤。保國則稱，保國於一九四四年九月參加盟國方面作戰，竟未被承認，殊可扼腕。同時保國亦未獲得進入愛琴海之權，保國之賠款雖自一億一千五百萬减至七千萬美元，但仍感負担過重，因保國在納粹佔領下，已陷於赤貧之境。羅馬尼亞力言該國將服從和的之條件，但希望與各國關係國直接談判，努力改善此項條件，以免不勝負祖。南斯拉夫不滿特里埃斯特區之解決辦法，謂南國不願放棄特港維尼齊亞要求里亞與戈里齊亞。希臘則謂保國邊界雖已擴大，但希臘之邊界則未被核定，希臘目前之邊界並不能確保安全，且感受條約下准許設立之保國五萬五千名常備軍之威脅。此間觀察家指出和約遭受一連串反對與不平，不僅發自以前各敵國，且發自盟國方面，今後安理會將充滿關於巴爾幹與東地中海之問題顯然可見。</p>
<p>〔路透社羅馬十一日電〕義外長史福薩於昨日致牒盟國政府，聲明義人民過去係在某一政權之壓迫下而行動。此次和約之討論，義政府並不獲參加，値茲簽字之際，深願證明義政府之願大胆面臨决等悲痛的事實，以協助建立世界具體的和平。義政府之第一項責任，即爲絕對忠於各簽字國政府及其人民，良以和的須恃簽字者道義的支持，始能施行之故。義人民爲首先脫離軸心自求解放之民族，後復在戰爭期問，以直接或間接之利益供給盟國，然對於此等功績，並未能給予合理的計及。吾人雖承認過去的種種錯誤，然主簽字時爲止，義人民已嘗盡力爲贖罪的行爲，今日吾人以義人民及世界公民之資格，切盼對足以毒害四千五百萬人民生活之束縛，得有修改之機會。</p>
<h3>裁軍案仍僵持中　美蘇代表舌戰無結果</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十二日廣播：在今日安理會會議中，法英完全支持美方縮軍提案，形成聯合陣綫，應付蘇聯。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖十二日電〕裁減軍備程序問題現交還安理會處理美蘇兩國代表今日又互相攻擊，雙方各不相讓。奧斯汀與葛羅米柯均向安理會詳述其本國之立塲，然均未有如何打開僵局之建議，美國堅持一切「集體破壊性」之武器應交原子能委會處理，而一切「原有」之武器交裁軍委會處理。蘇聯則堅持兩委員會之任務不應分列。葛羅米柯在半小時之演說中，指責美國之建議，故意背離裁軍之主要目標而致「遷延」。奧斯汀則謂，蘇聯拒絕美國之計劃，使原子能之管制不能開始，並力言裁軍會議之繼續拖延，將「增長戰爭之危機」。葛羅米柯最後稱，「美國欲劃分原子能委會與普遍裁軍委會之任務，顯然欲將我人主要之目標移至純粹之組織問題，此種策略是否有用者」。安理會定下星期三上午繼續辯論會議程序問題。</p>

<h3>太平洋中的軍略要地　密克羅尼西亞羣島（上）　本報資料室</h3>
<p>在廣遠遼闊的太平洋上，有許多大小島嶼，星羅棋佈地安置着屬於密克羅尼西亞範圍內的三羣小島嶼——馬紹爾，馬里亞納，和加羅林羣島，其管理權必須重新確定。這是對日和約中的重要課題，與未來太平洋的安全，大有關係。</p>
<p>地下形勢概要</p>
<p>密克羅尼西亞圈內的三羣小島是由六百餘個島嶼和一千四百餘個礁島組合而成·南北長一千三百浬，東西二千七百餘浬，天然構成一座海上長城·馬里亞納羣島居於最北，加羅林羣島位於西南，馬紹爾羣島則稍偏東南，成一品字形。雖然一共祗有二千餘平方公浬的面積，但在太平洋上的重要性，是不能輕視的。</p>
<p>此三羣島大多爲火山島，珊瑚島，或珊瑚礁所構成，而且渺小得很，最大的是加羅林羣島中的波納皮島，凡三七六平方公里，而以馬里亞納羣島中之塞班島，經濟情况爲最佳，面積計一八四平方公里。各島位置，均在熱帶，平均溫度爲八十六度，雨量也很豐富。照地理環境而言，是頗適宜於耕作的地方，無如面積太小，又缺乏冲積土，水源稀少，故在經濟價値上，打了個很大的折扣。日人在第一决大戰後，獲得其統治權，銳意經營，輸出的糖，酒精，磷酸鹽，娜子乾核，乾魚，數目也不很少。密克羅尼西亞羣島在軍事上的價値，遠在經濟價値之上，假使以關島爲中心，（關島可說是馬里亞納羣島之一島，惟爲美領，故不列入本文範圍之內）北至東京，東至威克島，西至菲列賓，均距一千五百餘浬，南至澳洲，亦僅二千餘浬。他們正處於亞美澳三洲之間，爲世界重要航綫所必經，乃三大洲間的渡橋，然也可以截斷三洲間的交通。過去在日人統治的時候，曾將他作爲侵略南洋的前哨，進可以攻襲澳洲荷印，阻隔美洲和菲列賓間的大路，退可以保衛其本土。當國際衝突的焦點移到了太平洋，各國都認這三羣島嶼是戰略上的要衝，誰不能獲得其管制權，誰就會受到威脅。</p>

<h3>市長召集各業舉行緊急會議　協力共渡難關　抵制瘋狂漲風　通令警察局嚴禁米糖果運銷郊外　整個金融政策短期內當有辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕連日金鈔狂漲，影響物價飛騰，吳市長以民生堪慮，特於昨日下午四時，召集有關日用必需品之各業公會，臨時舉行緊急會議，商討遏制漲風辦法，出席市長，社會局副局長李劍華，處長顧炳元，市參會徐副議長，市商會金泣庠，高傑臣，駱清華，銀行公會李軔哉，工業協會吳蘊初，米號業公會萬墨林，棉布業公會　九峰，油菜公會張超及錢兌，餅饅，熱水，猪行，鮮肉，南北貨，豆腐，鮮魚，蔬菜，經售米糧，地貨，油廠，機煤，糖，海味等業百餘單位代表。</p>
<p>市長大聲疾呼切勿推波助瀾</p>
<p>市長首稱：此次召開會議，主要目的希望日用必需品切勿因金鈔之飛跳，而亦隨之推波助瀾，造成不得了之局面。此次物價跟隨黃金上漲，黃金則跟隨美鈔上漲，美鈔上漲原因，乃因爲錢兌業拒收舊美票，而要新美票，近來更限制要聯號之新美票，造成美鈔暴漲，影響物價，現首先須向錢兌業要求者，令後買賣美鈔，不准有老票新票之分，更須取消「聯號」之舉，若再有類似情形發生，市府必予拘辦。至米糧黑市之猖獗，尤爲不合理。現市府每日配售西貢米一萬石，天地良心，足夠上海市民一日之食用，而米號竟尙有拒售隱囤之事。昨日市府已查獲米　一名，囤米五百石，業已由警備部稽查處加予拘捕。今後決嚴禁米糧運銷郊外，現已通令警局，隨時密切注意，如有查獲，除米糧充分外，並予嚴厲處分，決不寬貸。至言市府配米，出貨遲慢一節，本人當可加予改善。現蘇州河中尙有米船二百艘，拒不出賣，但相信渠等如堅不出售，亦不用想走得了也。</p>
<p>總之，此次之事，希望各業公曾，協助政府，共渡難關。關於整個金融政策，中樞當局於最短期內即可有辦法。市長說至此，連稱：「大家帮帮忙，否則的話，一定要我來辦幾個，似乎就太沒趣了」！最後，市長並希望大家不要滿腦子都是金子，如果人人都以黃金作比較，那末一切事都不好辦了。</p>
<p>拿出良心來豬肉未漲價</p>
<p>嗣後，市長即就麵粉，食汕，棉布，煤球，食糖，豬肉等各業，各別詢問其困難之點，並駁斥其漲價之不當，且呼籲各業同業公會拿出良心來。昨日會中，僅鮮肉業大出風頭，鮮肉業同業公會代表稱：「人家漲價，只有我們跌價，昨日豬肉跌至四千四百元」！市長聞言，速連拱手稱：熱心公益，好極！好極！」全塲且報以熟烈之掌聲。</p>
<p>政府可垮台天下必大亂</p>
<p>繼由徐寄廎表示在局勢空前混亂恐慌之目前，對於日用必需品，政府必須加以控制，實施配給，並鼓勵市民對於囤貨居奇，抬高物價者，儘量檢舉。</p>
<p>後由駱清華表示對目前本市悄勢憤慨異常，謂此次漲風之襲米，已超越一切可能之理性，僅能喩之爲瘋狂！彼稱：雖黃金美鈔大漲，但外匯匯率未變，則絕不應有此惡果。各同業公會切勿忘記去年向政府當局請求救濟時之悲慘周面，若自甘隨金子捲入漲風，即爲自趨沒落之途。試問在今日之上海，誰還有購買力？利息如此高，那個商號還有能力囤貨？倘各業再不自覺，三天漲價二倍結果，則二星期後，經濟將趨崩潰，政府可垮台，天下必大亂？而吾等又將處身何地？</p>
<p>要抑平物價須控制物資</p>
<p>駱氏並請市長轉達政府，督促政府，儘速決定緊急措置，確立黃金政策。駱氏認爲政府只有二條路可走：（一）條量拋售，你要多少，我配給多少，則三天之後，金價也立即抑平。若政府實有通貨膨脹之苦，則應立即恢復民國卅四年六月四日前之局面，黃金根本不許買賣，那時候，誰都不會想到連黃豆芽亦會隨著黃金走，故政府若將黃金逐步收歸國有，則一切可入正軌。（二）封閉黃金市塲，則黃金不能自由流通，其價必跌無疑。</p>
<p>駱氏最後對中國現行局勢表示非常感慨，謂自由民主過度强調之後，使經濟情形悲觀得很，其實在這動蓋局面之中，一切可由政府收買，然後有規則配給，不必怕戴法西斯蒂的帽子。並稱：「開會對於抑平物價毫無效用，在今日，要抑平物價，必須控制物資」！</p>
<p>市長邀集全各同業公會代表討論抑平物價問題（本報攝）</p>

<p>第三被告吳蓉生，係三泰雜糧行經理，除會辦理糧貸外，尙代糧政處拋售公米，原擬拋售三萬石，並曾與糧政處協定，每旬日爲一期，每期拋五千包，惟自五月十五日起至二十五日止之一期中拋出四千五百卅包後，汪達人即命停售，故未續售，但稱：此項停止拋售命令，並無書面公文，僅由汪達人口頭通知。　第四被告萬墨林，年四十六歲，本地人，現任荳米業公會理事長，上次開庭，因適在京出席國民大會，故未出庭。據稱：萬昌新，萬昌均由彼創疫，兩處均由楊潤畬爲經理。糧貸米共辦四百十五石，爲便利起見，均由萬昌新行售與萬昌號發售。對糧貸有舞弊情形，未之前聞。　第五被吿邢志剛，係順豐號經理，據稱：貸款彼申請時已滿額，後因萬墨林允將萬昌新名下之貸款交渠代辦。餘一概不知。第六被告楊潤會稱係萬昌新經理，糧貸之款由老劃萬　林讓與邢志剛”出讓原因不知。並稱萬字牌號共有三個機構，萬昌廠專司輾米，萬昌新行專做批發，萬昌號則應門市另售。三處各自立帳目，經濟亦各獨立。</p>
<p>僅取官利三分未收其他費用</p>
<p>第七被告汪達人稱：糧貸之舉辦係應地方要求，經政府批准，因糧政處成立未久，對各糧號參考　資料缺乏，審核困難，故初次試辦採取推荐方式。糧貸款僅取官利三分外，並不再收其他費用。庭上訊原定拋售公米三萬石而後僅售五千石即行停止一節，汪答，當時糧部徐部長說軍糧孔念，不能全數拋售，後因拋售之米係糙米，不合本市需要，故奉徐部長命後停止拋售。庭上至此即檢出徐部長致警備司令部函令被吿閱看，內稱拋個五千石即停止之事，部中並不知　，糧政當亦未呈報。汪仍請當時因軍糧需要</p>
<p>第八被告任星　稱：糧貸商十七家，無一家係伊介紹，且彼於五月八日即辭職，其時糧貸尙未結束，本人無牛毫貪汚，如庭上發現有貪汚證據，可立即槍斃。並稱當時報上稱我爲任援道之姪，及畏罪潛逃等情，全屬信口　黃，本人對之十分憤恨，故在京時曾向徐部長密呈一長函，其中檢舉各節盡爲實情。時庭上點首會意，即令退席。</p>
<p>尙有證人未到庭諭改期再訊</p>
<p>繼傳上人，諸人對「審查費」皆稱毫不知情，亦從未付過。彼等除三家係由李崇年介紹外，餘均係豆米業公會及商會所介紹。審判長旋即諭吿；本案因尙有證人邵季高朱到，改期再審，被吿王巽之，莊漢章，吳蓉生，汪達人還押，被吿萬墨林，楊潤畬，邢志剛，任星　仍交原保。在押四被吿之聲請交保各駁回，餘飭回。</p>
<h3>交部保障機航人員飛機遇突變失事　不負刑事責任</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央航空公司及中國航空公司機航組主任陳文寬，吳士等，因受地檢處警吿，飛機失事須負過失殺人責任，特向公司提出辭呈。經公司當局挽留並呈請交通部予以保障。茲悉交部已於昨日電覆准予備案。按自去年耶誕節客機三架在滬空失事後，地檢處偵查結果，會照不起訴處分書遂達央行機航組主任陳文寬，副主任何守榮，及中行機航組主任吳士，副主任陳鴻恩王助內稱：「查三十五年十二月二十五日客機三架連續在滬失事，兩公司機航組人員對於該日航機之指揮未盡注意安全之能事，不無過失責任，依刑法業務過失殺人致死罪，最重本刑在五年以下。因合於大赦條例，予以不起訴處分」。</p>
<p>接奉警告　提出辭呈</p>
<p>陳氏等接奉此項警吿後，認為責任問題固然爲機航組主管，但失事有因天氣突變或機械故障，非人力所可預防，亦防不勝防，是以事變之來，非機航組所能挽救或預防。但地方法院竟以業務過失殺人致死嫌疑起訴，幸邀大赦，否則須受數年有期徒刑，無乃冤枉。因此公司當局提出辭。</p>
<p>建議保障　獲准備案</p>
<p>兩公司以陳氏等服務有年，値茲民航亟待發展之時，人才寳貴，因此一面力予慰留，一面呈報交通部建議此後如有飛機失事，一應就失事之眞因以判貴任誰屬，鑑空衡平，期於無枉無縱。若因氣候之突變，在人事已盡，人力難施之情况下，其專門負責人員應予以保障，俾去其框怯之心，而能安心供職」。此項請求送呈交部後，昨日公司當局接獲交部覆電，略稱：以後任何飛機在起飛以前，應由機航組人員作一詳細週密檢查，以期安全，檢查人員並應簽字負責。至於由其他突變原因在非人力所能挽回之情况下失事時，韋門負責人員應予以保障一點，准予備案。現公司方面已將此項覆電轉達機航組，陳氏等辭意可望打銷。</p>

<p>據吳天才供稱，彼等係於十二月廿九日由滬至京時，張祥林方由獄遇赦出獄，至京後犯案十餘件，已不易憶淸。最大之案爲二月一日於車上竊去某旅客之四百萬元，二月三日二百八十萬元。在滬犯案已達百餘件，且曾數度失風被捕，均係最近遇赦出獄者。各犯衣履楚楚，女犯悉穿織錦緞旗袍，全新海勃絨大衣，足登高統黑色皮鞋，嚴然貴家婦。男犯西裝革履，儼然公子哥兒，外表絕對無法知彼爲竊犯也。又此男女六犯定今日下午由警務處移解地院法辦云。</p>

<h3>價值六百億物資　接收舞弊案起訴　孫芹池等三員俱犯貪污罪疑　周福山等四人涉竊盜罪嫌　符合赦例不予起訴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市政府接收延平路物資，價値六百萬萬元舞弊案中，市府前高級職員沈振家·孫芹池·沈文元，經地檢處　宏標檢察官偵查張結，認為確有貪污罪嫌，業於昨日提起公訴，案中福記營造廠周福山·周雲山·張敬堯·陳榮鑑四人，雖亦有竊盜罪嫌，惟犯案在卅五年十二月卅一日以前，縱使所犯罪嫌屬實，亦在大赦之例，故予不起訴處分。</p>
<p>起訴書全文</p>
<p>沈文元，男，年卅歲，青浦人，現業美術公司，住徐家匯站街五九弄一號。沈振家即據庭，男，年卅七歲，餘姚人，現業商，住長春路四一五號內。係芹也即芹如，男，年五十歲，杭州人，住北四川路長春公寓一樓一號。</p>
<p>右開被告因貪污嫌疑一案，業經偵查終結為應行起訴，茲將犯罪事實及證據并所犯法條開列如左：　繳沈文元，於勝利後，市府接收需人，得繼任為上海市政府總務處車務股科員，沈振家係任職總務處車務股主任，孫芹池係任職總務處處長，乘滬地敵日甫告投降，一切接收事宜正米就緒之際，於民國卅四年九月間，市府缺乏汽車與汽油，曾將梅逆思平之汽車伕潘仲仁，飭拘到處詢供，是明路敵日商營之出光公司（即日商中華出光興產株式會社之簡稱），藏有汽車被告沈文元，奉派帶同潘仲仁，前往調查，當將江海路棧房內汽車多輯拖回。該沈文元因而得悉出光公司另有大量存油，分藏本市各處，向處報告。被告沈振家得報後，僅與被告孫芹池一度商洽，旣未報請市長核准，亦不顧常時滬市另有敵偽民營工商業處理委員會之事設機構，竟擅先接收，俾可圖得不法利益，於是仍派沈文元往出光公司接洽，當由出光公司日籍職員吉田，將該公司各處存油數量，抄就明細表交沈文元携回。被告等將該項明細表匿不列報歸卷，一面按址至藏油地點從事接收，除派被告沈文元外，並派科員郭大盛·技士陳恩復·楊國楨，將該公司昆明路·澳門路·格蘭路·同嘉路·延平路等處存油，全部收得。其延平路存油數量最多，接收後並不造具淸册，即由被告沈文元在原堆棧門前加藍用市政府大印之「上海市政府堆棧」紙招牌，以為掩飾目標，俾可予取予携。其同嘉路·澳門路·格關路三處存油接收後，不惜耗費工程，車運至昆明路油棧一處集中，使數目混淆，異日難於查考，復另調榆林路分局警察常駐昆明路油棧看守。自卅四年九月廿一日起，該處將是項接收之油又陸續取用。至卅四年十二月，出光公司又造送該處財產目錄四份，卅五年一月，該處派科員葉耀卿駐昆明路油棧負責保管，掩人耳目。（本文未完，載左下角）</p>

<h3>囚首垢面一偽員　張口結舌賴奸名</h3>

<h3>大火案行政處分　決照報告書辦理　周兆祥記過卓厚道撤職　朱慶瀾與李壎撤職留任</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕西摩路武定路大火案，關於行政部份，業經調查委員會調查竣事，由主任委員葛克信將報告書呈報市長。市長對於處分一節，已決定照辦。並認為消防處長周兆祥，亦應記大過一决。報告書全文，其中分八個要點：對於改善員警待遇，補充消防器材，增加經費，招致義勇消防人員及肅正不良風氣等，均有所論述。最後論及全案之責任與處分時，認為西摩路火災所以發生之因素，實至複雜，有政治的，經濟的，社會的，歷史的乃至心理的種種關係存在，然消防人員不得以此推辭其責任。竊取財產警士所屬之宜昌路區隊長卓厚道，管訓無方，擬予撤職處分。最先到達火塲之指揮官朱慶瀾暨該管轄區區隊長李壎督導不力，擬撤職留任。總隊長夏國樑疏於監察，擬記大過一次。消長周兆祥，雖不負救火直接現任，但管理考核及計劃，未能盡善，擬請手令申斥。其牽及刑事者，仍俟法院審結再行議處。警察局江寗分局巡官林振強，蕭佐生，警戒不力，擬各記過一次。所望各員警能從此競相勗勉，力事振作，社會自有公論·固不難於短期內，恢復榮譽而重獲市民之信賴也。</p>
<h3>張迺作主張　消防機構　官督民辦</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕西摩路火災調查會，調查委員張迺作站於參議會警政委員會召集人之資格，發表談話云，西摩路大火案，經調查結果，認為消防底確有不當之處，雖經費拮据，設備蘭陋等皆係主要因素，然消防管理方面之不完養，乃無可否認之喜實。當調委會參觀中央區消防處時，該處之一百五十呎　梯車，於二十分鐘因尙不能試行緊出，其疏忽職務之處由此可見。此外前工部局時代，消防處於得獲警報後，三十秒鐘以內，可將救火車開動，現據消防處自稱，因限於設備之不完全，最快須在一分鐘以後，最慢須達五分鐘。而統計去年一年之間，本市火警達一〇六三次，平均日有三起，以每次遲誤五分鐘計，則須損失多少人民之財物？故本人認為消防之組織方面必須改善，除積極方面，如放實馬路尺度，拆除不規則房屋等，可由政府責任辦理外，其他部份，可採取官權民辦方式。僅恢復前工部局時代之義勇消防警制度，仍不足以使警個消防機構改觀。至於消防組織官督民辦以穢其經費方面，本人認為政府應予協助，而與消防直接有開之保險業公會亦須担任其一部份，此外可由民衆自行勸募。關於詳細改組辦法，將在下决參議會召開時提出討論云。</p>

<h3>接收舞弊案起訴書（續前）</h3>
<p>按出光公司佔用延平路三六〇號，原為周福記營造廠廠房，同嘉路二九號亦為周福記分廠廠房，以淪陷中曾受雇修理工作拖欠工價，勝利前日人畏懼我盟機轟炸，乃將各項油類物資疏散佔堆其廠主周福山即周正福，自已更因畏懼敵勢日蹙，平日交易，易授人嫌，始終託故避不問聞，而所雇看廠員工周雲山·張敬堯·陳榮鑑等，見被告沈文元等如此措置，亦即乘機偷盜，惟其所竊物資數量及被告沈文元·沈振家等，上下其手，侵竊物資品名及實在數量，以日人吉田辰彥抄交之各處存油明細表，始終臟　在沈文元私人之手，實雞詳細查得其確數，姑就該處函送敵偽產集處理局之接收出光財產目錄，已在卅四年十二月間，距離該處擅自接收之時日，歷三月有餘，該目錄雖為出光公司所造送，內中復漏列該處接收延平路一處存油，並於其他接收存油內，加註漏桶·空桶·空箱字樣，顯見是項目錄，係於案發後，被告等勾事日人補造，以為彌縫掩飾第祗存油一項，市府查封者共計五九，六七八介侖，若依照處理局查緝組批示中發表數量，共有六七，三九〇加侖，兩相比對，即多出油類計有七，七一二加侖，折合每大桶五十介侖，即多出一五四大桶另一二加侖，如是已堪認定此項油量，為被告等隱匿少報。况經江蘇監察使署於卅五年三月十一日，派員實地調查，於延平路空塲內查封處發見尙有被灌出之柴油六大酒　，為周雲山·張敬堯等所竊出，未及携走。事經張振萍·陳少亭·俞祥林等，分別先向第三方面軍密告，曾由第三方面軍前軍品接收委員會物資組組長呂師尙，於三十四年十月三十日，派組員王增略，率同報告人前往調查計在延平路三〇號抄出火油柴油共六百二四桶（每桶均五十介侖），及脚踏車內外橡皮胎各二百只，洋磁磚·鐵搭鈎·鐵絞練及孟山都糖精三十聽等，存在一大房間內。尙有另一房間及屋外樓房內，則貯藏大鋼窗鋼門六十五扇，竹節鋼條七八十担，大料松板約五萬方尺，水流　　四五十担。機稱因王組員所携封條，不敷應用，面諭周雲山等看管，除對於松板·鋼窗·鋼門等王組員以不能斷定為敵資，故未予查封，對於鐵搭鈎·鐵絞練·竹節鋼條·水流鐵板等，據密報人常塲亦未提及，難以斷定為敵產。偵訊中又擄周福記營造廠主周正福，堅決供陳為確係營造廠內用物，實非敵產故王組員未予查封外，按諸王組員增略三十四年十一月一日原答呈，內積延平路三六〇號查獲敵產火油柴油六百二十桶，與出光公司所浩報之數，被告等又已遷出四桶，又十一月十五日，王組員報告內稱會同該密報人等前往同嘉路二九號調查該廠所存敵產火油二千餘筒，前經市府派員押運出廠，但未給收據云云。核　陳榮鑑供承藏有小箱火油二千四百九十八箱，大鐵桶火油二百五十稀，大鐵桶紅車油九十五桶，大鐵桶柴油一百廿九桶，均由沈文元用二五九五二號一五二〇六號卡車，陸續運去之供述，數量大相懸殊，亦屬被告等共同侵竊無疑查經江蘇監察使署據密告調查屬實穢，予以糾舉，移付懲戒，復由中央公務員懲戒委員會認為涉及刑事嫌疑，發交上海高等法院檢察處轉令偵查，一而復經司法行政部准行政院秘書處據張振萍等之告發抄發原呈，令由上海高等法院檢察處於三十五年十月十六日先後轉令偵辦各在案。茲就上開經過事質，足以認定被告沈文元·沈振家，孫芹池等之犯罪證據論列如次查市政府總務處派員接收敵資，及車運動用敵產，暨與三方而軍接收組呂師尙交涉停運延平路堆存油料等等舉措，均極重要，何以事前旣不予承辦人員以正式公文，事後承辦人員又不隨時書面報洽，甚至據被告沈文元供，此項報告接收品名數量表，已交被告沈振家轉呈，被告孫芹池竟稱事忙，無暇細看，仍發交收存等語（經質訊被告沈振家·孫芹池亦不否認），直迨監署澈查，始補入本案承辦人員書而報告二三件附饗，以為搪塞，茍非被告沈振家與沈文元串同一氣，沈文元何能將已封存之物資，任意竊取，而接收時僅以一空頭蓋印紙招，縣掛門首，即為接收能事已盡，旣不列報細數，復又始終將日人所造明細表，迄至離職巳久，仍藏匿於私人之手，其為共同竊取公有財物，實屬百喙難辯而被告孫芹池身任總務處長，對於如此重大物資擅先接收，乃處置竟若是顢預，縱不能證明有如何朋分之確數，其於接收後明知屬員貪污有據，予以庇護及不為舉發，尙復何辭以解。除其餘被派往帮同接收人員悉受被告沈文元涴振家之　廠，應免置議，周福記營造廠周神山即正福，職員陳榮鑑，尙乏具體竊取物資明證，僅有消極共同盜竊之嫌，與周雲山。張敬堯共同竊取柴油之行為，均膺大赦另行處分外，被告沈文元。沈振家·核有刑法第二十八條懲治貪污條例第三條第二款之罪嫌，被告孫芹池核有懲治貪污條例第八條之罪嫌，應依同條例第三條第二款之共犯論外，合依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第一條第一項刑事訴訟法第二百三十條第一項提起公訴，檢察官顧安標。三六年二月十二日。</p>

<h3>緊急對策即將實施　投機氣氛漸次消散</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日各報南京來電，咸報南京中樞當局，正籌劃安定金融經濟對策，且有於日內付諸實施之說。本市金鈔股各投機市塲，昨晨初開趨勢，尙承日前收盤銳勢，頗呈健穩，惟驟即不支下鴻。其他各商品市塲，一般趨勢，莫不止漲轉疲。據本市金融界若干權威人士觀察：政府對目前金融混亂狀態，決不致置諸不顧。渠灤信安定金融方策，日內必可公開發表實施。所望民心應以安定為上着。渠等認為：近日來金融波動之主要策動者，厥唯一般市塲之段機心理。民心不安定，適中投機者之陷阱，終而釀成市塲之巨波，據分析；目前市塲泛濫之龐大游資，其主要來源，一為農磨年關所發放之生產貸款四百餘億元。二為外埠向滬　集之大量游資。其來源除各行莊之匯款外，最近且因匯款限額關係，更大量以現鈔方式輪入。三為各公司工廠行號發放職工之年終獎金。渠認為今後金融主要之課題，即為如何誘導市塲游資，入於生產途徑。游資旣各得歸宿，自不致再在市塲投機作祟。</p>
<p>市儈咸有戒心金鈔同時回落</p>
<p>（本報訊）金市買氣昨已潰散，晨開即慘跌至七六〇萬有賣。自七三〇萬買價起，曾同升至八四〇萬，而後退至七五〇萬，始漸穩定。十時後，以七七〇萬之價，央行配給三五〇條，人心復呈騷動，曾回漲至八四〇萬上。此後即在多方心理自動潰散下，有供少求，近午步降至六七〇萬。午刻回升至七二〇萬左右。午後隔日交割上塲時曾疲落至六八〇萬，一度挺進至七三〇萬，不久金融帮有售，且銀根抽緊，制止流言不一而足，三時後開始回瀉至六四〇萬低價，而後升至六七〇萬結束。結果較前收回跌一七五萬。飾金仍掛七十五萬，銀元回跌亦多，暗拆銀根漸緊，息價自一角半至一角八。</p>
<p>外幣昨告回落，美鈔暗市晨開一五〇〇〇元至一六〇〇〇元，中途回升至一七七〇〇元。近午隨金市回落至一三五〇〇元，午後雖挫而不多，結果較前收回跌四千元。港票自晨初之三千四起，一再回小，最後在二千七至二千八間徘徊，結果亦回落八百元。港匯以市况混亂，且申電未曾報來，業中人無法成交，大致三千一有供。印匯三七五〇元。英匯四九五〇〇元，均賣價，缺少成交。</p>
<h3>公債回跌</h3>
<p>公價昨回跌頗鉅，統丙晨開三四〇〇元，即有三六〇室五五二室來賣，低價退至二千九，六〇四室等稍納，而後回出三千元外，結果較前收計甲乙回跌二〇〇元，丙跌四〇〇元，丁降五〇元，戊跌一五〇元，成交約八百萬元。</p>
<h3>外股亦下瀉</h3>
<p>外股昨亦見跌，怕紗初開一四四〇〇元，曾升至一五八〇〇元，而後步跌，小股低後有回，結果較前收計怡紗英聯會德豐怡啤航業各跌二成強，餘者各降一成半左右。</p>
<h3>市商會開會</h3>
<p>駱淸華緊急動議</p>
<p>勸告工商界自肅</p>
<p>市商會今日召開理監事會議，駱清華氏提出緊款動識，勸告工商各業共同抑平物價，運用「同行公議」之善良習慣，重振同業業規，恢復商業道德，並建議政府採取下列緊急措施：（一）重行確立黃金政策，（二）實行進出出口聯鎖，（三）收購物資，控制物價，（四）增加生產，節約消費云。</p>
<h3>貝總裁返滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕由央銀行總裁貝祖詒，十一日晚因公晋京，已定昨日乘晚中返滬，預計今晨當可抵滬。衆信貝氏此行，與安定滬市金融有關。</p>
<h3>銀樓業門市　昨日已比較冷落</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨晨中央銀行以七百七十萬元之價格，配售黃金三百七十五條予銀樓業。各銀樓初時掛牌七百九十萬元，惟以市况逐步下瀉，下午收盤為六百四十萬至六百八十萬元，銀樓掛牌亦改低為七百五十萬元。下午各銀樓門市部，顧客已無以前之踴躍，且兌出者大有人在。據銀樓業某鉅子稱：行市波動下跌時，各銀樓高價配進之黃金，以受市况下跌影饗，不得不貶價供應門市需要，結果常遭虧蝕。惟查各銀樓之收進價，係按常時市况之最低為準，且係兩尙須扣還耗蝕費一萬四千元，而兌出時除照掛牌價外，尙須依飾物工程之繁簡，收取手工費，以一綫戒而論，工銀即需一千二百元云。</p>
<h3>社會局平米價</h3>
<p>准許商店及私人</p>
<p>照議價申購暹米</p>
<p>社會局為抑制米價，昨日起按照議價，允許商號私人申購，並在四科陳列米樣三瓶，米貨雖未見上好，但亦不甚低劣，己適商號廠家食用，昨日往該處申購者絡繹不絕，每石七萬元云。</p>
<h3>粳秈黑市續漲　食油漲風稍戢</h3>
<p>昨日米糧到源仍只糯米，計南市塲有陰元七九石，北市塲有白元一五二石，險元二九石，交易寥寥無幾，價格再漲一萬三五千元，社會局之二號西貢米，去化仍見暢達，二號續配出三萬一千三百八十包，內南市塲二萬一千二百包，北市塲一萬零一百八十包，價原盤未更。米價連日上騰甚巨，昨市多數米商似已心存畏懼，兼之近來粳秈米一無到貨，囤貨畏風險，不敢出籠，故均抱觀望姿態，不做交易。非正式行市又喊高的二萬元，白粳迫十七萬元，薄稻達十六萬元，早稻洋秈均在十五萬元左右。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>承上日俏勢，實需頗暢，行市續創高峯，兵船粉達六萬大關，利朗洋粉（七〇磅）高達八萬元，各牌粉的較上日疾升七八千元。麩皮投機仍熱，奈以缺乏實銷，形勢不振，大包先堅後疲，小包回挫二三千元。小麥仍乏供源，價約在七萬二三千元。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>漲風稍戢，市勢漸轉疲象，客商心思已有乘高吐脫，又逢原料生仁回瀉，消化亦見懈淡，簍生油回挫一萬五千元，桶生油亦跌二萬元左右，豆油貨色甚少，價形平庸，淸菜油等未聞交易，惟小車蔴油反見再漲二萬元。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>黃豆早市堅定，其後供源蟬聯，聞有數艘船將到埠，故市况漸趨疲境，大迎豆由八萬五千元跌至八萬元，揀靑價與上日相仿。赤豆微挺二千餘元，芝蔴各本兩方仍有吸收，價續秀五千元，菉豆形勢甚佳，苞米彷彿，生仁問風甚厲，貨主擁擠出售，市氣不振，價回瀉二萬餘元，後市竟苦無受主。豆餅早問投機商猶圖掙扎，價喊高千元，終以消化不靈，即見回降，過程先堅後疲。</p>
<p>北貨開始回跌</p>
<p>北貨近日以金潮關係，亦步升不少，昨已開始問跌，如葵子開十五萬五千元，津紅棗上下檔扯價二十五萬元，陳高莊元棗二十二三萬元，新統手二六萬元至二十八萬元，昌平桃二十一萬元。</p>
<h3>汽油進口數量足敷全市需要</h3>
<p>每季二百五十萬美金</p>
<p>汽油恐慌現象，自價格調整後，巳稍見改善，茲據有關當局告記者稱：外間對汽油進口困難之說，盡係推測之詞，現當局規定汽汕之進口額每季為二百五十萬美金，此一數字已足够全市需要，故車主如不乘機搶購，從事囤積，汽油供應，決不致發生恐慌。</p>
<h3>華股隔夜變色　漲停板翻作跌停板　市場上一片賣出聲</h3>
<p>華股昨在細忽中隨大勢而叵降，若干種股票，跌停穢復有制價表演，晨開即告劇降，二三號九七號三六號均售，遞永紗降至一三五〇元，一九八號八西號一二號二一九號一四五號一五四號均進，而瞬即回升至一四四〇元，一九二號二七號二〇號九七號曾賣小至一三七〇元，金市回升，一四五號一四號一五六號七六號一五四號一二號來進，遂漲到一四五五元，一九八號一五八號二〇號一五二號七〇號一一七號二二四號一九八號一七一號紛售，金價步降，遞永紗曾喊低至一二六〇元，（無成交故祗一二七〇元為低價，）此時塲內若美亞景福火柴公司勤興均告跌停，且有削價交易做開，新亞不久亦告跌停，最為虛怯，三六號二〇七號先進後出，二號一五六號一〇〇號咸補，而最後在一三〇〇元左右徘徊，結果較前收計永紗美距信和新光景福動興均在跌停左右，華豐微降，遞交祗上午半天交易，計永紗新光均跌一成強，美亞信和跌停，華豐微降，冷股中紡有九五號維持而獨平，火柴永公新亞跌停，餘均見疲，午後一八〇號一四號一七號一五六號一五二號均售，現永紗自一三〇〇元起，盤跌至一二七〇元內，二三二號一九八號二一九號八九號二二四號八四號紛購而回升至一三一〇元，一五六號一四五號仍售，終告不支，三時後，金價更疲，夜報載主席密令監視金融市塲之訊，一七三號一七號三五號八五號七四號一五八號九四號均售，逐步下降，信和美亞永公新光勤興內衣决第跌停，美亞信和景福勤與均有削價表演，臨收時迫永紗至跌停限度，六一號一五六號一七一號一九八號均來維持，臨收尙穩定於一二四〇元左右，結果較前收計永紗美亞信和新光景福勤興均告跌停，華豐跌落少許，冷股永公內衣跌停，中紡火柴各跌一成強，新亞等前市跌停，午接無成交，水泥　安降落較少，遞交祗前市有交易，計華豐微降，餘均迫近跌停限度，塲外各股中法世界平平，餘尙挺升。</p>
<h3>橡膠原料存底杜薄　要求輸管會寬放進口限額</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市橡膠業同業公會近以滬市原料存底枯薄，而輪管會限額分配處，最近許可臨時進口之八百噸橡膠內，製成品及舊車胎，己佔半數生膠僅佔四百噸，尙不敷本市各橡膠廠一週之用，大部工廠，勢將被迫停工，故昨日該公會代表洪念祖等十餘人，特於九時卅分，携同書面呈文，向輸管會限額分配處，要求寬放橡膠進口限額。分配處處長李斡，適因公晋京，由沈副處長代為接見，當據呈分州為解答：（一）製品與原料分開辦理，常允照辦。（二）一月份橡膠進口之限額，當於本月十五日以後發表。其限額是否可循請求寬放，則尙待考慮。（三）香港存膠運滬一點，分配處以限額業已分配予本市各進口商，而本市各進口商又未必與港地存膠有關，故此點亦尙待考慮。</p>
<h3>化工原料進口困難</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕擄化工原料商業某負責人稱，自輪管會將化工原料列入第二類後，化工原料之進口，大致已成影響，凡申請輸入者，許可證多未發下、致化工原料之價格，在供不應求中，普遍上漲，然一般價格與美鈔黑市相較，仍未漲足，各商行深恐將存貨售罄後無法補進，故大帮交易淸淡異常，目前燒碱價格，已較前漲起二倍，硫酸亦漲起一倍餘，其他如紅　鉀凡士林，過氣化納等亦均漲起一二倍不等，燒碱我國雖有製造，然因歟量不多，與運輪困難，除中紡公司訂購一百萬噸外，以不足供各廠商之需求，酒精我國亦有自製者，故價格比較平穩、然製造不精，品質不純，鮮能與外貨相比，一般而論，我國化工原料多需仰給於外國，如輪入辦法不能改善，則我國化學工業所遇之困難，當逐日加重云。</p>
<h3>食糧配售價不變　配售方法仍照上次議定辦理</h3>
<p>食糖評議會第十四次會議，昨日下午三時，在社會局舉行，討諭配售方法，仍照上次會議議定辦理，即本期配精額，按照各戶在第一期至第四期申請額總和四分之一配出，至第一期至第四期中未申請配糖者，本期各配糖十包，價格問題，亦議決不予變動，中砂赤砂每擔仍為十四萬元云</p>
<p>糖價回降</p>
<p>昨糖市初堅後疲，及聞金價回降，各糖均隨鬆，公會劃盤現貨中砂自初為二十七萬元，後為二十五萬元，下午為二十四萬五千元，生砂赤二十一萬元，二四粗白及秘魯細砂棧單同為二十四萬五千元，號順德靑晨開十七萬二千元，旋至十六萬五千元，普通十六萬元至十五萬五千元，興化白二十五萬五千元至二十五萬元，興赤十九萬元，共成交五百餘件。</p>
<p>又訊，台灣公司今日糖貨標價一律照舊，而配給額亦照上期，惟每行家須有二家具結。擔保不做黑市，如是則今後糖價成可轉平。</p>
<h3>紗價倐起倐落</h3>
<p>昨日紗市一波三折，晨初因金價跌落人心甚形虛法，廿支特雙馬做開五百萬，較上日狂降一百萬之多，普通廿支亦落五六十萬，如水月立馬成交三百八十萬左右，旋以紡建掛牌較市塲高四十萬至八十萬，引起廠家搜買，水月藍鳳因此復品至四百廿萬，為當日之高峯，然曇花一現，俄頃問紗號供售殊殷，價又進四百萬大關，最後成交三百九十五萬，當日有四十萬之幅度，結果終較前日跌五十萬至一百萬元，人心頗有志忑不定之况。</p>
<h3>紡管今日開會　討論收紗價格</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡管會自本週一開始辦理南運紗布申請事宜以來，迄昨日為止，已核准之南運數額，計棉紗三七四三件，布九五九九疋。又該會前發各廠收購棉紗之通知書，昨亦已全部收齊，該會核定收購通知書，亦已陸續發出。又該會定今日下午召開例會。屆時將討論收購綿紗議價之新原則云。</p>
<p>紡建售紗</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例售紗，共計售九九五件，廠商佔八八〇件，紗號佔一一五件。申請戶數，廠商四一三戶，紗號五四戶。</p>
<p>杉木大跌</p>
<p>木材市况，日前杉木之劇漲，因受金價關係，昨受金價下回，杉木隨之劇落，洋杉下降尙微。</p>
<h3>遞交證據金　提早交納時間</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日來華股市况，因受金鈔影饗，波動亦大。證交昨對遞交證據金之繳納時間，決定暫矛提早半小時，均應於翌日十一時一刻以前，繳納淸楚。一俟市况正常，再行公告恢復原定時間云。</p>
<h3>航商向國外購船　須符合三項標準</h3>
<p>勝利以後，我國航業界紛向國外訂購商輪，其欺字極為可觀，交通部對今後各航商在國外訂購之商輪，已規定必須符合下列三項標準：（一）船齡必須在三十年以下，（二）吃水在十八呎以下，（三）時速必須在十哩以上，交部此項規定，聞為便利結匯工作，因中央銀行外匯審核處時對申請購買船舶結匯工作審核極嚴，嗣後能合於上項標準，央行即准予結匯云</p>

<h3>台省長官署教育處長　范壽康赴京述職　昨過閡談台省教育情形</h3>
<p>台省長官公署敎育處處長范壽康氏日昨由台過滬，即將赴京述職，向敎育部有所報吿並請示。記者往訪，詢以該省過去敎育實况及目前情形，承范氏吿稱：</p>
<p>教育設施</p>
<p>台省長官公署敎育處，自三十四年十月二十五日正式成立，掌理全省教育行政及學術文化等事宜。年餘以來，該處對教育設施，可分三個重要階段，第一是接收時期，是從三十四年十一月一日起至上年三月底止，除建立敎育行政機構，接收敎育機一關外，即本陳長官以行政不中斷，工廠不停工，學校不停課原則，設法使各學校繼續上課，同時確立該省敎育方針。第二是準備時期，從上年四月一日起至七月底止，該處即依照旣定方針，從事作改革及推進敎育之凖備。第三是改革與推進敎育之實施時期，從上年八月起一直至現在，經這三個階段，確已奠定發嚴台省敎育之基礎。現該處爲澈底消除過去日人所施之殖民地敎育政策，特擬定敎育方針，以闡揚三民主義，培育民族文化，灌輸實際智識技能，獎勵學術研究，而尤注重敎育機會均等。</p>
<p>學校概況</p>
<p>關於台省學校單位，高等敎育，在過去有台北帝國大學，合北經濟專門學校，台中農林專門學校，台南工業專門學校，以上各單位，光復後，均經一一接收，目前台北帝國大學，已改爲國立台灣大學，並由敎育部辦理，規模頗大，除設有文政，理學，農學，醫學，工學五院外，並附設醫學專門部及大學預科，其他各校亦由該處改爲台灣省立台北商業專科學校，台灣省立台中農業專科學校，合灣省立台南工業專門學校。但一年來，因隨時調整關係，曾有不少變動，如以上省立各校，於上年一月將商業專科學校改爲省立法商學院，台中農業專科學校及台南工業專科學校於上年八月經該處分別改爲設立學院。中等敎育：在日人統治時期，計有公立中學校一八所，高等女學校二〇所，職業學校二五所，光復後，即由該處派員分別接收，各校名稱亦予更改，並繼續開課。國民敎有方面：根據該處上年八月統計，全省計有國民學校一〇四八所，班級計一三。五二四級，學生總數八九〇·　五九七人，（其中逾學齡學生計一五·　四二九人）敎員共有一四·八五九人，全省學齡兒童計一·〇六二·五二七人，其中已就學者八七五·一六八人，佔百分之八二·三七，失學者計一八七·三五九人，佔百分之一七·六三。以上數字，比光復前之統計，已略有進步。至於上年度全省國民敎育經費總額，共計台幣三四五·三五一·　四九二元，均由各縣（市）自行負責籌付云。</p>

<h3>私校學生三百餘名昨向市教育局請願　要求保障清寒同學不失學</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市學生學業保障會，於昨日下午二時半，集合南模，滬新，交通，肇光，建成，麥倫，靑年會，中國女中，智仁勇，正中，華東等十八中學學生共三百餘人，列隊至市敎育局請願，手執紙旗，在廣塲前高呼口號，並遍貼標語，散發宣言，提出四項要求：（一）要求當局立即發放五億元私學補助費，充作助學金。（二）要求當局澈查敎育貸金全部賬目，並發放敎育貸金餘款，將全部本利充作助學金。（三）要求當局保障淸寒同學，先行上課，勿使失學。（四）要求切實增加敎育經費至憲法規定之百分之卅五，補助私校，改善教師待遇，减一輕家長負担。當田敎育局中等敎一育處謝處長答覆稱：（五）五億元私一校補助費，市府至今尙未發下，可轉向市政府申請發放（二）敎育貸金事項，係由市敎育會負責，敎育局可派負澈查（三）救濟淸寒同學，不使失學，敎局深表同悄，前已通令各校，得定百分之二十全一免額，及百分之十半費額。全市八萬中學生，如各校能切實遵照此項規定辦理，則有一萬六千人可全免，八千人半免。現敎局正澈查各校是否遵行。如是項免費名額已滿，尙有淸寒同學，則本人可以私人名義，請求各校校長准予免費或半費。總之敎育局已想盡方法，使淸寒同學皆有書可讀。關於保證先予上課一點，如已申請免費半費尙未批准者，可先行上課，後補手續。（四）提高敎育經費一節，須由市政府提交市參議會決定，敎育局亦很希望能做到。謝處長並言，此爲個人問題，可個別解決，不必集體活動，可由各校塡其淸寒同學表格，交教育局審核，如確有清寒者，担保設法，不使失學。請願學生認爲滿意，於五時十五分散隊。</p>
<h3>東吳物理教授　陸鴻鈺返國</h3>
<p>東吳大學物理系敎授陸鴻鈺博士，自民國卅年夏赴美後，即入佛省理工大學專攻工業物理。逾年該校以陸氏成續優異，即聘請留校擔任講師。卅二年陸氏爲更求深造，赴約翰霍普斯金大學研究分光學，同時接受美國戰事生產局之委託，研究專門問題。卅四年佛省理工物理系主任羅博生博士親赴的翰霍普斯金，敦請陸氏返校擔任副敎授。去年秋聯合國大會在美舉行時，陸氏與魏學仁博士二人，代表我國出席原子能委員會之科學及技術分組，集英美法加荷各國之原子能專家於一堂，共同探討。最近因經東吳大學校長楊永淸博士在美一再敎促，乃辭去佛省理工敎職，乘輪遄返，業於上月杪到達，適當東大春季學期開始，全校師生以具有國際聲譽之陸敎授返校，使東大理學院敎授陣容，更臻健全，莫不表示萬分欣忭。日前陸氏赴京，向有關當局報吿出席聯合國大會經過，公畢後，即將返蘇授課。</p>

<h3>交大籃球隊　敗於晨友紅</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕交通大學籃球隊與晨友紅，昨晚七時半，假該校體育館舉行友誼比賽，交大同學旁觀者一千餘人，雙方戰來無甚精彩，李震中不在塲，以致小貓捉不得大老鼠，雖前半時迫得各十四平手，然終以球運不佳，以廿八比卅九敗於晨友紅手中。戰情如下：</p>

<h3>發展閩省經濟的一條新動脈　福廈公路踏勘</h3>
<p>— 福州三日航訊　本報特派記者陳正予</p>
<p>早在民十五年，閩南　　　求暢通沖洗省特產貿易，乃集資籌建福廈公路。本綫起自福州，南下福清，莆田，惠安，晉江（泉州），南安，同安等縣而達角尾與漳（州）嵩（嶼）公路相啣接，全長凡二七公里，當時乃分段修築，迨至民十八年始全綫通車，雖路面工程未臻標準化，然已成為國東南唯一交通命脈，亦爲閩省運輸最頻繁之一綫。</p>
<p>民廿七年抗戰軍典，全厦二島先後淪陷，本路因循海建築，地處要衝，奉令澈底破壞，全綫橫樑原有二五三座，涵洞一六八道，水管五〇四道幾經全部損毀，即國內著名之長達五三〇公尺之惠安洛陽橋亦經炸斷，全綫路基大都化爲田陌，破壞之澈底於茲可見。</p>
<p>勝利後，閩省當局認爲該路之修復興閩省經濟發展關係頗世，擬即從事興修，惟以省當局之財政狀况，絕無力完成此項浩大工程。乃經省建設廳長朱代杰氏及省公路局局長張九成氏在京滬與中央當局再度磋商結果，由交通部公路總局，聯總，行總及閩建廳協同進行復路工程。預定今年六月間完工，屆時當可全綫通車了。</p>
<p>各方供應原則確定</p>
<p>此綫除全部土方部分業經利用國民義務勞動服務征召沿綫各縣民工修復完成外，餘者則爲橋樑，涵洞，水道及路面舖修等部分。初經省建廳派員會同聯總工程師Grace實地勘察，僉認應以機械築路爲宜。聯總方面可撥修路機械來閩，惟尙須技術，運費，工資及原料等費用的在十二以上，省府以財力有限，乃呈請中央指撥，後以物價波動甚烈，預算不得不騰加改編。經張局長一再向中央磋商，交通部允補助工程費十五億元，及允許撥付全路所需五千餘噸之水泥價款及其運費的十五億五千萬元，省府則負祖工程費廿億元，是以中央及省政府共負担約五十億元，聯總則供應築路機械器材如鋼筋，縐紋管，鏟土機，碎石機，開山機，平路面機，拌洋灰機，修車機，運料汽車等及機械所必需之燃料消耗全部。行總則負担工資及機械運費（包括機械起卸臨時碼頭及便追之修築）計七十二億元，是以此路除機械及燃料不計外，共需工料費一百二十二億之譜·四方供應原則於焉確定，並訂有合同·交通部特指派公路總局第三機械築路總隊於月前來閩協助技術工作。</p>
<p>爲便於工程進行及管理起見，去年十月十二日成立福厦公路復路工程處，由公路局張局長自兼處長。據張局長向記者表示：如各方供應不發生問題，物價不影響預算，本路的六個月可完工。</p>
<p>全綫六段分段施工</p>
<p>根據工程處的計劃：全綫分爲六段，分段施工。聯總供應之築路機械，大約二月初旬可由滬裝運來閩，在此項機械未到達前，工程處已完工第一段之大部橋樑涵洞工程，第二至六段已由公路總局第三機械築路總隊出發準備開工。</p>
<p>胼手胝足血汗舖築</p>
<p>本路凡長二九七公里，爲閩省氣候最佳，人咪最密物產富庶之地。據非正式估計：本綫及其支綫所經地區之人口的達七百萬人，佔關省總人口約百分之六十强。因沿綫地區屬亞於熱帶範圍氣候受海風的調劑，所以，極宜於水菓的種植。此路修復後，可刺激華僑之僑滙及海外投資，不啻爲閩省開一財源。同時對閩東南，各縣農村之繁榮，亦必指日可待。</p>
<p>記者此此次出發參觀福厦公路的起點路程，據工人對記者談：僅此路基的舖築，乃沿綫數十萬民工冒溽暑，擋風雪，長時期胼手胝足舖出來的，爲交通的疏暢，爲國家戰後的復興，他們留了血汗，並沒有怨言。據張局長云：在國內用機械築路，除了滇緬路在英方技術支持下者外，此次尙屬創舉。此路寬達六公尺，路面厚可廿公分，算是標準很高的一條新公路·而且，由於應用機械的修築，路基穩固，灣度過大的地方，可用開山機寬拓路面，確保行車的安全。</p>
<p>京滬一帶今年夏秋間可喫到閩產廉價水菓</p>
<p>記者頻詢張局長，此路在施工過程中的困難所在。張氏速連搖頭。據答：並無技術上的問題，而是閩省物價波動太烈，無法控制預算，在極端不容易的情况下，集中了上述一百廿二億元的工程費，到了下半段的施工，是否够呢，假如再因物價波動，必須增加工程費，則爲一大難題，蓋因各方面對於此路所負担的費用，皆已達飽和點。</p>
<p>不過，張氏一再向記者表示：無論如何做下去再說，總之，路是要修的·是的，福建經濟的窒息，是由於閩省特產的滯銷，疏暢閩省特產的輸出貿易，不特有助於閩人，而且有助於國際貿易，福建的茶，漆器，不是可以取得外滙嗎？福夏路的完工，無疑的是福建經濟復興的命脈。張氏從事工程近廿載，在抗戰時期且曾參與滇緬路的工程設計，經騐頗豐。此次修復福厦路的擬議，是張局長在京時向交通部提出，邀得中央當局的同意與支持。今日閩省財政萬般拮據，而張局長與建廳長朱代杰氏，對於此路的修復，同具堅決的信心。記者相信在兩氏苦幹之下，於今年六月間可全綫通車，爲閩省公路史放一異彩，爲八閩造福。而且，此路暢通後，閩東南水菓的輸出，因爲運費的降低，價格目當跌落，京滬一帶人士今年夏秋之間，當可吃福建廉價的水菓。</p>

<p>花園口堵口問題，政府與中共方面正在爭論之中，同時，也是黃河凌汎高漲，冰塊已經衝出到了口門的時候，全國水利委負會委員長薛篤弼氏，突然於上月二十八日由京飛來，視察堵口工程，並且第二天就在花園口舉行會議，連續地討論了兩天。道堵口工程已到了緊急的階段。</p>
<p>去年十二月上旬，堵復局把伏浿時期所冲走的木樁補齊，積極拋石，築成便橋下面的石壩，使口門上游的水位抬高了二公尺上下。工程進行非常順利。到了二十七日夜裏，一陣狂風作了好事，催促</p>
<p>黃流</p>
<p>冲開引河口門，進入故道。眼看着口門堵合的希望，馬上會成爲事實。不料中共又像在去年伏汎前一樣，當你堵口將成之際，又出來找麻煩，在元月五日提出了技術以外的問題。一面薛篤弼氏在上海和聯總及中共方而商談，一面黃河陝州水位在上漲，等到第二次商談的時候，流量已經突破歷年凌汎的最高紀錄，增到過二三二〇秒立方公尺。口門便橋中段的八排木樁，在三天之中先後的跟着彼臣流去。廢曆除夕前後，西北各地連日大雪，工地上括着砭骨的寒風，雪花在捲在旋地落下來。有一個拋石工人，從便橋上被吹跌到河裏，幾乎作了冰凍雞。已經進水的引河，因之凍對，水流只得從河底緩緩地流入，比原來的水流，减少了二分之二。這樣的劇變，眞是令人結舌瞠目，難怪堵復局朱局長要在守歲的夜裏流淚長嘆了。</p>
<p>薛篤弼氏到達鄭州的那天早晨，沙河流域周口一帶的修防工程，也因凌冰的撞出，發生了很大的</p>
<p>危險</p>
<p>雖然潼關下游有兩個破冰隊，用炸藥破冰，可是流到周口沙河裏的冰塊，仍舊有一公寸厚，有桌面大小。那天周口北寨西北角上，迎水寺和老鬼窩之間，有一里多長的磚頭和柳枝做成的掃工上的粗蔴繩，很多被冰刀割斷周口以下六十華里的水寨北關附近，水位漲到三公尺二，水面和四級護岸相平，如果再漲兩公尺的話，黃水就會漫出河床，漫到田裏。周口和水寨間的苑寨以上的護岸工程，也被冰塊和急流冲塌了八十公尺。近幾天來，氣候轉暖，沙河開始解凍，可是花園口上游河面仍舊在淌凌。說起來凌汎在陰曆立春（二月四日）之後大致算期滿，不過極汎前春風早把凌冰溶化，水位也要上漲，水勢必然更趨汹湧，沙河方面的修防工程，很可能發生極危險的現象。至於花國口是否會有問題，誰都不敢預作斷語，就是口門上最近的演變，在事先朱局長也沒有料想到。</p>
<p>那末堵口工程在什麼時候能够完成呢？　在薛篤弼氏來到鄭州的前兩天，堵復局曾經重新擬出一個計劃，決定把原來平堵的方法改爲</p>
<p>立堵</p>
<p>所謂立堵，就是先從便橋兩側加築邊壩，格子壩，東西同時進行，向中間伸展，把便　完好部份堵齊，然後在沒有了木椿的缺口中間拋沉柳　，使口門完全合龍。另外在口門下游（舊河床）加挖引河一道。所需補充的料物，柳枝和　科二千四百萬市斤，大小木椿三種，共計八萬萬，由局方發價請工地鄰近的鄭縣，中牟，開封，廣武，原武，陽武等六縣代購，限期在二月底全數繳齊。代購料款，共計十一億七千元，局方已經分交各縣。薛氏到鄭後，又作最後決定，原擬加挖的一道引河，增加爲三道，以期全河水量流入一半，口門上所受的冲擊力，也减輕一半。</p>
<p>修築邊壩，格子壩的工作，現在已經開工了各縣代購的料物，近日來正在加緊運送。</p>
<p>在園口黃河大堤的缺口，你難治的毒瘡，從開始動手術到今天，足足十個月，經過兩次「限期」，瘡口未能收疤痊愈。其主要原因是按術以外的問題從中作祟，同時黃河的水比女人的心還難以捉摸，往往在你摸到她心邊的時候，她的心又變了。道决薛篤弼氏到鄭來修改了原來的診斷方，希望技術以外的問題，勿再發生，更希望黃河的水，勿再撒嬌，那末，在四月間梅汎之前，我們大家來慶賀這偉大的工程的完成。</p>
<h3>像牯嶺，也像羅馬！　壯麗的金門海灣</h3>
<p>— 舊金山四日航訊　本報特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>這裏，我有介紹一下舊金山地理形勢的必要。舊金山是一個可大可小的名稱，正如同紐約和「大紐約」之別一樣。普通說紐約市或紐約城，即是指「漫海墩」一塊市中心而言。通常所謂紐約八百萬人口，那是包括漫海墩以外的布朗市，布碌崙，昆士等等區域而言。舊金山也是如此，大舊金山是一個整個海海，美國人稱爲海灣區Hay　Area，海灣區像一個倒寫的「C」字，輪船就停在C字的灣內。海灣的大門，就呌做「金門」，金門大橋，（全世界最著名的大橋）橫跨在門上。金門大橋的兩端，是兩個小小半島，南邊的一個，便是所謂三藩市，也就是通常所稱的金山。</p>
<p>金山是海灣區的商業中心，整個半島，由七座高低不平的山邱連綴而成，和古羅馬的『七邱之城』有些一相仿，『羅馬不是一日造成的』，金山從開創到現在，也將近一百年了。一直到今天，金山還不是美國第一流的大都市。許多中國朋友，至少我自己，在沒有來到金山以前，都對舊金山有過高的估價，道觀念是錯誤的，舊金山現在還祗八十萬人口，商塲和市政，都比第一流的都市，紐約，芝加哥，費城，洛杉磯，迪屈魯相差遠甚，就拿整個金山半島而論罷，熱鬧的街道和商業區，僅佔了半島的九分之一。</p>
<p>「世界上條條路司以通羅馬』，舊金山也是如此。金山現在是太平洋航錢的起點和終點，是飛機的必經停歇站，也是橫貫北美大陸鐵這和公路的起點和終點。假如撇開這些大題目不說，就看海灣區本身，橫震海灣約有多少輪船，還有著名的金門大橋，以及實際上比金門大橋更長的三藩市大橋。</p>
<p>金門大橋是從三藩市半島的南邊，通達到北邊半島的，那兒呌做雷却蒙，也是住宅區。三藩市大橋則是橫跨海灣內部的，從三藩市半島到奧克蘭和柏克萊。</p>

<h3>加里福尼亞大學　附設「中國學院」</h3>
<p>奧克蘭有一部份工廠，有報館，有大規模的百貨公司。柏克萊則是加利福尼亞大學的所在，也是最理想的住宅區。奧克蘭和柏克萊原是連接著的一塊土地，因爲易於分別，及行政管理上方便起見，所以劃分成兩個區域。譬如：加利福尼亞是美國出產水菓最多的省份，也是釀酒最多的省份。當局爲使加利福尼亞大學的學生，不致沉緬於「杯中物」起見，在柏克萊是禁酒的，但在奧克蘭，却可以放懷暢飲。酒和鴉片畢竟不同，年靑的美國少年，要跑好幾英里外去喝酒，終覺得有些不合算，久而久之，也就無形的戒掉了。</p>
<p>加利福尼亞大學，包括八個不同的單位，校本部及學校行政中樞，在柏克萊，全校學生連附屬學院在內，一共有四萬零八百人，是當今美國規模最大的學校。大學部和研究院，課程以嚴格著稱，敎學方法，除學期制與學季制不同外，大體和芝加哥大學，有相似之點。校長施波爾，以着於演講著名，美國人稱爲近代兩大演說家之一。（另一個爲已故總統羅斯福）。</p>
<p>校本部三萬學生中，中國學生的五百人，大部份多屬華僑子女，國內來的不到一百人。校內有「中國學院」，專敎中文閱讀和會話，美國學生甚多，但敎學進度甚慢。其他院系中，關於中國及東方的踝程，也有不少。一位中國人馬博士，敎中國政治哲學及政治思想，在加利福尼亞大學執敎已十五年，最初當助敎，逐步逐步，最近才昇任敎授。加利福尼亞的圖書館，藏書百萬册，是當今美國五大圖書館之一，建築和哥侖比亞大學圖書館相似，學生勤學的風氣，似在哥侖比亞大學之上。圖書館後面有鐘樓，樓各『塞瑟』，因紀念校舍建築時總工程師塞瑟氏得名，星期天鐘樓開放，可由電梯登樓頂，眺望整個海灣。</p>
<p>加利福尼亞大學的校舍，依山而建，很像武昌珞咖山的武漢大學和杭州錢塘江畔的之江大學。不過，建築比武大精美，規模比之江宏大。加利福尼亞大學的男女健身房和游泳池，都分別建造。山坡高處，有原子彈的秘密研究屋，禁止閒人入內。</p>
<p>國內學生遊行反對蘇俄駐兵東九省的時候，加利福尼亞大舉中國同學會，也有過一次響應。學校當局對學生作政治活動，是嚴格禁止的，道和美國其他許多大學不同，尤其和紐約的各個大學不同。</p>

<h3>交通管制欠佳　發生撞車悲劇</h3>
<p>從柏克萊到舊金山，有二十分鐘一次的電車，整個舊金山海灣區的交通是方便的。但在市內，因爲交通管制欠週，常常有撞車撞人的慘劇。三藩市市內，到現在還很少有紅綠燈，而城市建在七個山坡上，高低又如此不平，很多地方像重慶的「七星崗」，穿罵路時，不能不提心吊胆。</p>
<p>我到舊金山的第二天，就發生電車相撞的慘劇，死一人，傷十五人，還有中國僑民在內。當地報紙上刋出大幅照片和新聞，也有檢察官對市長，交通局長，汽車公司老　「提起公訴」消息。</p>
<p>這不僅是舊金山的問題，也是加利福尼亞全省的問題。加利福尼亞什慶都可愛，就是「人種歧視」和交通管制不可愛。去年聖誕夜，美國全國翻車撞車案九十餘起，加利福尼亞佔一半。</p>
<p>但是，舊金山的海上交通，却是安全的。中美之間，一條船來，一條船去，都以舊金山作樞紐。最近一條「麥克將軍號」從中國來，載來了蔣鼎文將軍，鄒秉文先生，以及許許多多考察人員和學生。海關對登岸檢查極仔細，許多認識的友人，都在靠岸兩天以後，才被查騐完畢登陸。</p>
<h3>「中國通」蒙哥瑪利</h3>
<p>商務關係，因爲船的暢通，逐漸顯得活躍。舊金山現在無疑已成爲對華商務的總滙。掌理這一機要的人，是中美商務協會的負責人蒙哥瑪利先生，他是一個對中國有好感的「中國通」。</p>
<p>我因爲過路倉促，沒有時間和蒙哥瑪利先生深談。但聽他和別的朋友講起，最近他對於對華貿易，非常感覺悲觀，悲觀的原因，倒並不是一般流行的所謂「幣値不穩定」「運輸不便捷」等等，因爲這些都是過渡時期意料中的現象。這位蒙哥瑪利先生最感覺痛心疾首的，是中國若干當權的官僚資本在作祟。他說：「長此以往，中美兩國的正當商人，都將束手待斃，當權的中國官僚資本，將會絞殺一切經濟聯繫！」我能够體會：地內心的憤慨。　但是，無論怎樣，舊金山總是在向着繁榮興隆的方向走的。張紫常總領事說：舊金山是中國的鬥戶，中國强大了，舊金山必然有它的前途！　我懷念着祖國，我更喜歡舊金山。每當黃昏燈影之夜，我常常獨登賀浦金斯旅館的屋項花國，俯瞰這顆太平洋岸的「彗星」。星期天下午，吳強華領事，駕車帶我遊覽全半島，我們她騁在金門公園，徜徉在克列夫海濱，太平洋的浪潮，驚動着成羣的海島，它們飛得遠遠的，遠遠的，遠到眼睛看不到的地球的那一邊！（橫斷北美大陸五晝夜萬里行第五篇昨文附圖，係「三藩市大橋」，誌此以代更正。）</p>

<h3>和平的解剖</h3>
<p>— 孫杭</p>
<p>The　Anatomy　of　Peace,by　Emery　Reves</p>
<p>「一本美車人必讀書」——紐約時報評論</p>
<p>人類喊着要和平，歷史恐怕已不短。每當一次慘烈的戰爭，死了不少人，流了不少血，犧牲了不少財產之後，人類總要那麼减一次：「下次不要再打吧！」</p>
<p>但儘管人類這樣喊，一次一次的戰爭還是層出不窮。打了數百次，受了數百次敎訓，喊了數百次，戰爭還是跟着要來，這是什麼緣故呢？</p>
<p>任何人都知道戰爭是殘酷的，有害的，但一當戰爭，大家却又拚全力以赴。任何國家都知道戰爭是悲劇，是苦痛，但大家却又無時無刻不在準備著戰爭。這是爲什麼呢？</p>
<p>許多有心世道的人士早已把這些問題思考過了，但他們所得的結論，所提的方法，又都沒有發生預期的效果。譬如菩薩心腸的威爾遜吧，他曾嘔心血創造了一個國際聯盟，想要從他身上，長出永久和平來，但不幸國際聯盟生了幾次猩紅熱便死了。從前的許多和平論者，從沒有像威爾遜這樣有見解，有毅力，有方法，但威爾遜也失敗了，這是多麼使人倒抽冷氣的事啊！</p>
<p>但第二次大戰的殘酷和犧牲，似乎對於善良的人們的善良的心，有了一種甚於前此的影響。有些人忘記了威爾遜的現在又開始記起了他，有些人背著威爾遜走的現在都向後轉朝着他的方向走，也有些有心人把威爾遜的道路仔細研究後，更開闢了一條和他同歸的殊途。總之，像威爾遜一樣爲和平著想的人漸漸地多了</p>
<p>所以，人類到現在，也許已能創造一個奇蹟，把他們多年喊着的和平實現出來。但人類要實現它，必須對和平有一種深切的暸解，必須把不和平的道理尋出來，從而想法子去解決他。人類如果錯覺了和平，看錯了不和平的道理，即使有誠心，有毅力，和平還是不能擔保的。因之，在我們迫求和平之前，對於和平實在有一加研究的必要。</p>
<p>最近讀了一本Emery　Reves著的「和平的解剖」，覺得他確是找到了人類不和平的肯綮之處。他的叙述，他的論斷，都使我崇拜，佩服。這本薄薄不足三百頁的小書，也許眞是我們人類永久和平的寄託所在呢！</p>
<p>問題的核心：狹隘國家主義</p>
<p>這本書分成三卷。三卷之前，還有一篇序文，題曰「哥白尼世界」。在這篇序文裏，作者引用了最近二十五年來的史實，說明了近代國家觀念的錯誤。</p>
<p>現在世界上林立着的國家，不下七八十個，但他們都有一個共同的偏見，認爲自己的國家是這個世界的中心。他們觀察世界上的事事物物都以本國爲出發點，他們從事國際間種種的活動，也都以木國的利益爲依歸。因之，同樣一件事實，從這一國看是這個樣子，從那一國看又是那個樣子了。這樣，每個國家都只爲她自己著想，眞正的互相諒解，互相容忍便絕對不可能了。</p>
<p>這種情形，很像自然科學上的托勒密學說（Ptolemy）一樣。托勒密在第二世紀發表了他的地爲宇宙的中心之說。照他的意見，地是一個不動的中心，太陽月亮和星都環院着他轉動。這學說。直到十六世紀時，才爲哥白尼推翻，但他畢竟也曾支配了一千四百多年。</p>
<p>現在我們對於世界的看法，對於國家在世界上地位的看法，正完全和托勒密的學說相似。托勒密的學說是推翻了，但我們以國家爲世界中心的學說還是堅不可拔，這是多麼錯誤的呢？</p>
<p>接着的三卷中，作者便儘量發揮了這一見解，並用各種事實證明他的論據。</p>
<p>第一卷裏，作者把資本主義，社會主義，宗敎，都加以批評。他以爲資本主義到現在已完全破產了，因爲資本主義的最中心的思想便是自由企業和自由貿易，但事實上，現在一般國家，爲了要增强本國的經濟能力起見；自由企業，已受到了國家常局的控制，自由貿易也因國際間關稅壁壘的高築，貿易競爭的惡化而變成國家的工具了。社會主義在蘇聯的實騐；也證明了他的失敗。正如作者說：「蘇聯不是在向著民主而發展，而是在向著國家的統制而前進。」共產主義已不再是一個目的了，他不過是一種手段，一種走向國家主義的手段而已。宗敎也是一樣，他已失去了他的天下一家的主張，宗敎徒都爲著他們祖國的光榮而祈禱，國家的觀念已超越他們宗敎的信條了。</p>
<p>在這種情况之下，許多國家都走向了法西斯之路。資本主義和社會主義已沒有顯著的區別，他們都在朝着一個方向走，走向國家至上主義。</p>
<p>戰爭與主權：需要徹底認識</p>
<p>第二卷裏，作者就進而說明戰爭和主權的意義。他以爲兩個各有絕對主權的團體，其上沒有一個能限制他們的組織，存在在同一個世界上，戰爭便不可避免。譬如歷史上許多戰爭，有的是部落和部落之爭，有的是王朝和王朝之爭，一直要到這些部落或王朝併成一個統一體國家時，他們間的爭執才可消滅。現代的國家，各自都有一個絕對的主權，絕不能稍加限制或放棄，戰爭當然是不可免的。但只要我們在國家之上，有一個能限制國家主權的政府，有一種共同信守的法律，國家之爭便能像部落或王朝之爭一樣的消減了。</p>
<p>但這一種政府，這一種法律，究竟該是怎樣的形式的呢？是不是就如國際聯盟，或聯合國機構呢？</p>
<p>作者爲要解答這問題，因此在第三卷內，又批評了國聯和聯合國的信念——國際主義，民族自決和集體安全。</p>
<p>作者以爲國際主義是無能的，懦弱的。國家和國家處在一個對等的地位，即使用條約彼此約束，他們的競爭還是一樣。民族自決更使世界分成了更多的單位。而且，眞正的民族自決在現在的情况下是是不可能實現的。譬如說美國要自決，而日本打上了珍珠港，她還能自決嗎？她的一切決定和政策，你能說是自決的嗎？波蘭是要自決的，但當德國威脅着他，打上她的門的時候，她還能自決嗎？世界上沒有一個公正而有力的超越國家的組織，民族自決是不可能的。</p>
<p>集體安全也是一樣。作者說：「沒有集體的主權，集體安全是無意義的。」任何同盟，國聯，聯合國等組織不過是把世界分成了幾個主權單位；拼命要維持現存的狀態而已，他是決不能隨著世界的進步一同進步的。</p>
<p>總之，在這個世界上，國家主義已統制了一切民主主義，社會主義，自由主義，基督敎，資本主義，法西斯主義，政治，宗敎和經濟。「國家主義是蘇打水，」作者說：「他和入任何飲料，都會使他們發起泡來。」</p>
<p>世界性政府：有心人的結論</p>
<p>因之，唯有樹立一個世界的政府，制定一種世界的法律，來限制國家的專斷和擴張，世界和平才可有望。</p>
<p>Reves先生是一個有心人，他已給我們找出了戰爭的癓結，給我們開了一個和平的方案。全世界的人應該都讀一讀他的書，研究一下他的見解，爲了和平的緣故。</p>
<p>本書出版後，美國有二十位學術界名流曾爲他發表了一封公開信，裏面說：「我們希望美國人都來讀這太書，……。」紐約時報的評論也說：「有一二千萬人讀着或討論着這本和平的解剖，對世界一定是有裨益的。」我同樣希望不但美國人，全世界的人都能一讀此書；不但要讀他，而且要能實行他的理想，那末，世界和平便能指日而待了。</p>
<h3>評「戰時中國政治」</h3>
<p>— 趙師傳</p>
<p>原名China's　Wartime　Politics　（1937-1944）</p>
<p>Lawrence　K.　Rosinger　作　Prineston</p>
<p>Uinv　ersity　Press,1945</p>
<p>這是一件很可惜的事，中國人對中國的政治總是不感興趣。這一點，只要看看我們關於本國政治書的絕無僅有，就可證明。像一運類的書，自然不大容易寫，特別在我們這樣環境裏，但我們對這一方面的忽視，却是不可諱言的。</p>
<p>這本書是外國人所寫的一本關於戰時中國的政治悄形，共只一百三十三頁。可惜一多半爲有關文件（如總理遺囑，五五憲草，及國民黨與共產黨之重要宣言等）所佔有。欲以不到六十頁的地方，寫中國抗戰八年的政治，當然不可能。所以這本書，像序言中所說，只是提　挈領的寫寫自由中國政治上的幾點重要發展而已。</p>
<p>全書分三章。第一章是「政治背景」，共二十二頁，算是最長的了。這裏除了叙述組成中國社會的不同階層外，對國民黨之革命史及其與共產黨的關係也有簡潔的說明。第二章是「統一與抗戰」，共十九頁。這章所提到的是：國共合作，長期抗戰，汪逆的和運，及民三十年皖南新四軍事件及其影響等。第三章「重慶及其政治變遷」算是比較重要了，但只十七頁。作者在這裏所討論的是：戰時政府人事及組織，蔣主席，國民黨，參政會，中央政府與各省，憲政遝動等。由於篇幅的限制，這些重要的題目，叙述得都非常簡略，但不無中肯的地方。</p>
<p>從上面的綱要，我們可知道這本書原不是給中國人看的。它的目的是給西洋對中國政治陌生的人一個概念。偶爾也可能使讀者比較的瞭解當前中國複雜政治情形的由來。假使此書有點價値的話，它的價値就在這裏了。</p>
<h3>介紹一本蘇聯兒童讀物「列寧故事」</h3>
<p>— 新俊</p>
<p>〔M.左琴科原著，曹靖華譯，三十六年一月滬初版〕</p>
<p>一個偉大人物的一生業蹟，靑年們是很需要知道的。尤其是中學生，讀了這一類的故事書，至少比風靡於市的神怪傳奇有益得多，而且也可長進不少知識。</p>
<p>這本「列寗故事」，很適合於一般中學生閱讀，它淺顯地描繪出了列寗的一生，而且，這些故事均是依據事實的材料而寫成，全書是一共包括二十個關於列寗的故事，在每一個故事中，都表現出列寗的一個特點。　原著者左琴科（M.Zoshchenko），是蘇聯著名的老作家，他很能寫一些優良的兒童故事，由於他底創作的優異，曾於一九三九年元月得蘇維埃主席團頒佈的勳章。由此，已可看出他的寫作技巧是很熟練的。</p>
<p>譯者對於這本著作，有一段很好的評語：「列寗故事眞可說是兒童文學中的一個新的發現。用樸實的語言，輕鬆愉快的兒童文學的形式，質樸而自然的來叙述列寗的生活，眞是一件不容易的事。」誠然，這著者表現形式很淺顯，內容却很充實。譯者又說：「對列寗性格的刻繪，都異常深刻。列寗的偉大形象，在這小故事裏，並不覺得有容納不了之盛，」　這書內，尤以「實蜂」與「列寗故事」兩個故事，描繪最深刻。其餘；玻璃水瓶，列寗是怎樣學習的，列寗怎樣戒烟的，列寗妙計却憲兵，給一側小孩子買玩具，在理髮室裏，列寗和爐匠，打獵等故事，都很節潔而明確地描寫出來。文字的形式很輕鬆，美麗。並有五幅插畫，帮助讀者的興趣。</p>
<p>正如譯者在結論中所說的：「這作品，不但小朋友們讀了感到無限的興趣。成年人讀了，也非常感動的。因爲這裏不但有兒童心裏所想像的列寗的形象，而且也有成年人心裏所想像的形象呵。」的確，這本書是具有這條件的。</p>

<h3>關於文天祥二三事</h3>
<p>— 譚正璧</p>
<p>劉泆劉洙和劉沐</p>
<p>天祥逃亡的時候，爲免敵人注目，曾變易姓名，各書所記不同。按「南宗雜事詩注」說是：</p>
<p>文天祥至鎭江，與其客杜滸等十二人夜亡。天祥乃變姓名爲淸江劉泆，東入海邊。</p>
<p>但是「東山談苑」裏却說：文山自淮泛海入台州界，易姓名爲淸江劉洙，爲黃巖縣張哲齋題綠漪堂詩。兩書一作劉泆，一作劉洙，有了歧異，所以「宋人軼事彙編「於引此兩倏後，加按語這：按此兩條，一作劉泆，一作劉洙，疑作「泆」者，偶　一筆耳。　其實是不須疑的，我們只消一查「指南錄」就可決定。「指南錄」中果有「綠漪堂」詩，其序云；予自海舟登台岸，至城門張氏家，蓋國初名將永德之後。主人號哲齋，闢堂敎子，匾「綠漪」，爲賦八句。</p>
<p>這裏沒有說出變易姓名事，但在下面一首「過黃嚴」的序裏却說：予至淮，即變姓名，及天台境，哲齋張爲（？）予覔（？）綠漪詩。予旣賦，題云：淸江劉洙書。此過黃巖，寄二十字。</p>
<p>乃知「柬山談苑」即據此而寫，但張哲齋明爲台州人，刦指爲黃巖縣，乃是作者一時誤記。</p>
<p>看了上面所考定，天祥易姓名爲淸江劉洙，是可以確定的了。但不知劉洙却實有其人，而且和天祥同時，還是同鄕，後來也合家殉國。這不是一時巧合，乃是天祥有意把熱人的姓名來作爲自己姓名的。可是「宋史」中不載其人，僅劉岳申「文丞相傳」中提及姓名。倘不是鄧光薦的「文丞相督府忠義傳」中有他的傳，那麼這樣一位和天祥相與的愛國志士，必將湮沒而沒有人知道了。傳云：</p>
<p>劉洙字淵伯，丞相隣曲。</p>
<p>丞相善象奕，洙雖不敵，</p>
<p>然窮思忘日夜，言趣俚下</p>
<p>，亦以是好之。從勤王，</p>
<p>號劉監軍，專將一軍，爲</p>
<p>督帳親衛。圓機應物，酬</p>
<p>答不倦。會病劇乍起，空</p>
<p>坑之敗，執詣隆興，與長</p>
<p>子同日受害。次子死亂兵</p>
<p>，幼子沒於廣。</p>
<p>一個國家的將士，如果都是這樣，這國家那會滅亡？但是像這一類的愛國志士，爲國犧牲後姓名湮沒不彰的，從古到今，不知百幾。即如這次國難中，在當時曾經報章揭載，而現在已大家淡忘的，不知也有多少，其他爲人家所未知的更是很多很多。所以表彰忠義，在國家應認爲一件重大的事，否則不獨無以對死者於過去，亦難以勵生者於將來了</p>
<p>但是這位劉沐，在「文山集」中，却又作劉洙。「文山集」卷十六「集杜詩」「劉沐第一百二十」序云：</p>
<p>宣敎郞督府機宜帶行大府</p>
<p>寺簿劉沐，字淵伯，予瞵</p>
<p>曲朋友，從勤王補官。予</p>
<p>陷，伯淵領諸軍還。及予</p>
<p>歸國，淵伯收部曲赴府，</p>
<p>會於汀，專掌一軍，爲督</p>
<p>帳親衛。沉實有謀，圓機</p>
<p>應物，凡江西忠義，皆淵</p>
<p>伯所號召，畫夜酬應，精</p>
<p>力不倦。……</p>
<p>到底是劉沐還是劉洙呢？這或許由于各書版本不同的關係。但如證「文丞相督府忠義傳」作劉洙，係作者一時列誤，那麼劉岳申的「文天祥傳」中又爲什麼也作劉洙呢？所以這問題只有以不必去解決來解決它了。</p>
<p>這裏還須附帶一述那位天祥爲他題詩的張哲齋，看他是怎樣一位人物。他的事跡也見「文丞相督府忠義傳」，傳云：</p>
<p>張哲齋，台州海上豪也，</p>
<p>所居曰城門鎭，蓋國初名</p>
<p>將永德之後。丞相自通州</p>
<p>泛海，過城門，哲齋延款</p>
<p>，結約舉事。張欣然聚海</p>
<p>艘，移檄海上，豪傑聽命</p>
<p>。會丞相至福安，請自取</p>
<p>明州，爲陳宜中，張世傑</p>
<p>阻止。張亦以失的止。越</p>
<p>二年，張弘範南伐，見檄</p>
<p>文牆壁間，屬舟人與之有</p>
<p>隙，吿捕至軍前。哲齊知</p>
<p>不免，語弘範曰：某生爲</p>
<p>宋臣，死爲宋鬼，何怪我</p>
<p>爲！弘範殺其父子，碎其</p>
<p>家。</p>
<p>原來也是一位可敬可欽，志節不屈的豪士，怪不得天祥念念不忘他了。</p>
<h3>幽禽飛上紫丁香　（攝影）</h3>
<p>— 張印泉</p>
<p>作家趣事</p>
<h3>華茲華斯</h3>
<p>— 沈思</p>
<p>英國大詩人華茲華斯（Willam　Wordsworth　1770-1850），是一個極共樂觀的人。又挺喜歡誇大，自己捧自己的塲；有一次美國詩人兼批評家愛麥生（Emerson）去訪問他，逍位大詩人拚命誇讀自己的詩篇，別人的他一點也瞧不起。又一次他寫封信給蘇格蘭詩人瑪克（Charles　Macky　1814-1889）說：他沒有一回讀過他的詩，並且也不想讀一次。</p>
<h3>莎士比亞在蘇聯</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>在前世紀的六十年代，一切莎士比亞的作品都已譯成俄文，有幾種還曾重譯過數次。新世紀的開始，俄國對於莎士比亞的興趣稍减，但在蘇維埃時期，又逐漸繁榮起來。當時有爲爾夏克（Marshak）神奇的十四行詩譯文，又有帕斯脫耐克（Pasternak），李維克（Levik），庫潑尼克（Tatyana　Shchepkina-Kupernik）等人的戲劇翻譯。</p>
<p>現在莎士比亞的俄譯極多，例如哈孟雷特至少有三十六種翻譯。</p>
<p>决於蘇俄的譯文就是阿美亞尼，第一種莎士比亞的譯文早在一百年前，罵思掛（Masyyan）的譯文已成爲阿美尼亞的重要典籍。</p>
<p>要想判斷譯文的好壞，倘若對於譯文不懂，是無法批評的。但馬思揚譯文之佳，幾乎受到阿美尼亞權威的學者，演員，作家和詩人一致的稱讚，這確是事實。</p>
<p>阿美尼亞新的譯文繼續出版，現在「哈孟雷特」已有七種譯文，「阿塞洛」和「該撒大將」各六種，「麥克白」和「威尼斯商人」各五種，「李亞王」和「羅蜜歐朱麗葉」各三種。此外還有不少戲劇的譯文。</p>
<p>喬治亞最著名的舊譯是馬恰比里（Machabeli）的。有名的喬治亞的演員柯拉伐（Khorava）演阿塞洛，就用的是馬恰比里的譯文。現在許多新的喬治亞的譯文也出版了。</p>
<p>最早的亞塞爾拜然的譯文是賈伯來（Djafar　Djabarly）的，他也譯得最好。他是有名的民族作家，十年前逝世，巴古劇場博物館就用他的名字題名來紀念他的。他寫渦劇本「熟情的新娘」（Bride　of　the　Flames），這劇本在亞塞爾　然極爲流行。他譯阿塞洛是在伊弗南（Everan）完成的，當地演阿塞洛的是一位年輕的亞塞爾拜然的演員辛南（Ali　Zeinand）麥白亦被譯成亞塞爾拜然文。新近伊勃拉希莫夫（Mirza　Ibashlmov）了「第十二夜」。</p>
<p>高加索譯莎士比亞也不少。例如，有些被譯成阿塞替亞語（Oesetian）.不久以前，阿塞洛還會用庫美克（Kuumyk）語大吉斯坦（Daghestan）的首都演過。但這樣的譯文很少印成書，因爲它們是專爲舞台用的。</p>
<p>在俄國大革命以前，烏斯俾克斯坦（Uzbekistan）簡直沒有劇院，現在却也有演阿塞浴與哈孟雷特的名演員了。莎士比亞在烏斯俾克人中是極爲流行的。烏斯俾克人有傳統的機智，常在茶館裏談天說地，因此他們極易於接受莎士比亞的機智，各國文字常用不同的方法來表現莎翁語言的機智。不久以前，烏斯俾克語的羅實歐與朱麗葉會上演。最有趣的是，這些莎劇的譯文竟首先介紹無韻詩給了烏斯俾克的詩壇。</p>
<p>第一個基爾基士（Cirghiz）的劇塲還是戰時新造起來的。這劇塲開幕就演「李亞王」。譯者從英文原文譯出，再與俄文對照，這方法曾被普遍採用。</p>
<p>烏克蘭作家弗朗科（Ivan　Franko。），基輔的劇院就用他的名字，他亦極稱讀莎翁，曾有十一篇文章論到莎劇。烏克蘭現今最流行的莎劇是Mnch　Ado　About　Nothing女演員就是電影「虹」著名烏莎飛（Natalia　Uzhvy）。</p>
<p>此外還有不少的蘇聯國家譯莎劇，一共有二十七種語言之多。</p>
<h3>燈</h3>
<p>— 懷宗</p>
<p>是凄凉的冬夜，門外的北風呼呼地緊吹着，偶然有二一行人輕微的脚步聲，由遠而近，再由近而遠，漸漸地像一縷輕烟似地消失在寒風中。是死一般寂寞的冬夜啊！</p>
<p>每夜，我孤獨地坐在煤油燈前，做着工作，在這荒僻的郊野的斗室裏，和我形影不離，時常陪伴着我的，唯有這　然的狐燈。每夜，它伸長着明澈通紅的火舌，吐出無限的瑩潔的光輝，我就被深浸在這米黃色的光輝裏。這光輝，它有獨特的柔和與美麗，彷彿奶白色的輕紗，又好像黎明時的薄霧，我時常悠然地墮入了幻想的深淵。</p>
<p>別小覷了這渺小的燈啊！它雖然沒有出類拔萃的姿態，五色繽紛的裝飾，但它却帶給我可愛的光明，給我愉快的感覺；它爲我驅走恐怖的黑暗，它溫暖了我的寂寞的旅人之心；它使我渾身覺得溫暖，它使我的血液波濤似地流轉起來。而且在它那亮光中，多少的名作鉅著都躍入了我的眼簾，它間接的補充了我的精神食糧，使我的精神有所寄托，啊！偉大的燈啊！</p>
<p>燈，的確是偉大的，它能把强頑的黑暗征服，使一切魑魅魍魎無從隱匿，它毫不容情地揭露萬物的本來面目。而且它也是仁慈的，博愛的，它把可愛的光明毫不吝惜地送給每個人，除非那個人不願意接受它的熱誠的賜予。</p>
<p>北風從門隙中進來，燈熄了。黑暗又溜了進來，我彷彿墜落在地窖裏，恐懼擊打着我的心弦。急忙用火柴拯救了它的生命。它又充滿了生命的活力，閃着耀眼的光輝，笑味咪的似乎在向我道謝。燈的生命是永恒的呢！不是嗎？無論春夏秋冬和風霜雨雪之夜，到處都有燈的踪跡嗎？</p>
<p>在每夜瑩潔的燈光下，我獲得了偉大的啓示，在燈光裏，我了解了人生的眞諦。</p>
<p>因此，有了燈，我的生命才充滿了活力，有了燈，我才不覺得空虛和寂寞，我不願聽聒耳的音樂，我不願看醉人的歌舞，我却願永遠陶醉在這靜和的燈光裏。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　167</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「誚把問題能出來，大家　　一個合理性的辦法，齊心一致，應當怎麼辦就怎麼辦。鄙人個人，毫無問題；只要不妨碍大計劃，準定一馬當先」。鶴見口裏的大計劃，當然指着他的企圖而說。</p>
<p>耀羣，小老虎和我，沒有發言。</p>
<p>「很好」，M君傾服鶴見的坦白，「大計劃，絕對不妨事。這是你我共同的唯一希望，常然不能犧牲了牠。……到底怎麼一回事呢」？M君自己問着自己，作爲間題的開場白。</p>
<p>「敝處這個組織」，M君綱續說，「自來很秘密。掩蔽上很巧妙。可是昨晚九點多鐘以來，直到今天這時爲止，形勢上好像有些不妙了「。……</p>
<p>「九點？「鶴見問，「那是我到這裏一小時以後了」？</p>
<p>「對了」。M君點點頭，「根據本部的崗位報吿，這二十多小時以內，每隔三兩小時，有人在這門口走過。當然他們能辨別普通人與特務人員的行徑」。</p>
<p>「沒有追踪」我插口問了。同時耀羣也像有同樣的問題發表。小老虎卻冷笑著瞧了　　一眼。</p>
<p>「有的」。M君肯定的答覆了，「晚十一點多，那是很露形跡的一次，我們有一位同志尾隨了上去。一直尋踪到東交民巷一間公寓裏。這公寓就在我們這裏斜對角，也有四層。……」</p>
<p>「耀小姐有什麼見解」？鶴見偏偏追問耀羣。</p>
<p>「可惜我跟虎弟發現得太晚了一點，被牠溜掉！還是前一小時的事，來不及報吿出來」。</p>
<p>「噢？…什麼樣的脚色，一個人還是幾個人」？鶴見又問着小老虎了。</p>
<p>「當然只有一個」。小老虎答應，「可惜是個娘兒們，要不……。」</p>
<p>「什麼？女的嗎」？鶴見驚惶起來。</p>
<p>「不，應當這麼說，虎弟」，耀羣又給虎臣上講義了，「應當說，我們碰見那個岔眼的人，只有一個，是一個楧樣很標緻的女子」。</p>
<p>「對的「M君答應了鶴見的問題，「人是只有一個，並且確實是女的，屋頂的瞭望崗報吿，牠在那公寓頂上，也時時用千里鏡探索，虧她好精神；一日一夜，竟不大休息似的」。</p>
<p>「耀小姐，請你說說效那模標，也許我可以……」</p>
<p>耀羣沒有等鶴見說完便插口了；「也只一晃眼，看的不眞；大約五尺二的身量：腰幹很細，好像有武功，舉動很輕捷」。</p>
<p>「有日本女子的特狀嗎」？鶴見縐起了眉尖。</p>
<p>「沒有，我在東北看見的中裝日本女人很多，一見就可指出；因爲那雙脚鴨子，必定竟而且扁，並且走起路來，脚尖是對內盤着的。這，她們燒成了灰，我也可以辨認出來。……」</p>
<p>「這也不一定」，M君也插口了。「紀小姐，二十歲以上的女子，可以這們鑑別，二十歲以裏的，就不能肯定了」。</p>
<p>「對哪」耀羣笑着「正是因爲牠在二十以上哩」。</p>

<h3>歐洲也在苦難中　數千萬人忍受着饑寒</h3>
<p>— 佐</p>
<p>英國今日的情形，比較戰時的情形更壞。不但英國如此，整個歐洲情形亦復相同。</p>
<p>數千萬的人民正忍受着戰後飢寒交迫的苦難，此刻已經進入第三個星期了。今日一般平民所有的物資比較戰時更爲貧乏。只不過橫死和暴斃是减少了——但有時人們更怕悲苦的生活。</p>
<p>可怕的風潮</p>
<p>英國各地被可怕的風潮襲擊着，阻碍了工業經濟命脈的煤斤的運輸。大多數的工廠都斷了電，多數家庭中的用電也受到限制。</p>
<p>英國工黨政府面臨着一個在醞釀中的第一等政治危機。戰爭使英國喪失了在物質上戰勝這種酷寒氣候能力，因爲英國度着「家庭無隔宿之糧」的生活，已經七個年頭了。</p>
<p>寒冷的家庭</p>
<p>二百萬的失業工人將回到他們寒冷的家庭中去，園着燃燒最後幾塊配給煤的火爐，吃着他們約有限的配給食物。</p>
<p>從上午九點到中午，下午二點到四點，倫敦家庭中的電力全部斷絕。住在使用電爐和電灶的公寓裹的無數母親及其嬰孩，將陷入悲慘的境地。</p>
<p>同時在文化水準和物質享受均較他處爲高的歐洲全境，我們看見了這樣悽凉的景象：</p>
<p>義大利由於煤荒，斷電已經多時。暴雨和溶雪滂沱成災，人民流離失所，迫使政府不得不採取緊急救濟。</p>
<p>世界樂園景物全非</p>
<p>瑞士　蕺爾小國，處於滿目瘡痍的大陸中，宛似繁華勝地，但亦不能免於同樣的苦難。商店櫉窗中不准燃點電燈，菜館酒樓减電三分之一。由於電力站蓄水池內水量的减少，各項工業用電被迪减少。</p>
<p>德國漢堡在最近一天內凍死四十八人。由於煤荒嚴重，一切電力不久恐將斷絕。</p>
<p>在奧國，家庭中每天斷電六小時。</p>
<p>比利時的情形好像和戰前差不多，但有義大利工人移入，從事開礦工作。荷蘭國內的煤氣和電力配給量最近已經减少了許多</p>
<p>法國在過去數天中，商店樹窗裏的電燈和其他廣告用電，都在禁止之列，同時全國的用電量日益减少了。</p>
<h3>福地？</h3>
<p>— 方文</p>
<p>有人說：「上海人心太壞，有錢人平日窮奢極慾，暴殄天物，造孽深重，所以上海部要遭一次大刦。」</p>
<p>也有人說：「上海人大都敬神信佛，初一十五，家家要燒些長錠，孟蘭盆會，金剛法會，佛事不絕，功德無量，所以上海實爲消災納福之地。」</p>
<p>我們大家都還記得，中日之戰一開幕，閘北就化爲灰燼，虬江路匯山碼頭，又演過幾次驚天地而泣神鬼的市街戰，及乎國軍西撤，城內便成焦土，最後全上海淪於敵手，上海不能說不是遭過一决大刦，在勝利前幾天，轟炸登陸，緊張到間不容髮，幸賴兩顆原子彈，很快地嚇得日寇屈膝求降，上海正在千鈞一髮之際，得以化險爲夷，畢竟上海是福地！</p>
<p>但是，請看這髮天情形，又如何呢？</p>
<h3>由拍攝「盜庫銀」外景想起</h3>
<p>— 建華</p>
<p>本報會載哥侖比亞影片公司，拍攝「盜庫銀」外景，將在本市外灘，南京路，南市，龍華飛機塲，以及城隍廟，保安司徒廟等，逐一攝取云。按「盜庫銀」，是一部偵探影片。由狄克鮑爾主演，以華盛頓，舊金山，上海，開羅等地方做背景，該公司爲了事實逼眞起見，竟遠渡重洋，來滬拍攝外景，他們製片的認眞，資金的雄厚，足使我們萬分欽佩。據說該片在去年十二月八日，在好萊塢開始拍攝，有六月底完成的計劃，今年下半年，就可運滬開映，我想屆時上海士女們，一定爭先恐後，一看外片中的本地風光了。</p>
<p>不過，本市城隍廟，保安司徒廟等地方，迷信氣味太濃，那裏有脚小伶仃的老太太，也有保存髮辮的老伯伯；那有不堪人目的問卜求神，也有窮形極相的各式乞丐。如果攝入鏡頭，這不是宣揚我們的古蹟，而是暴露我們的醜態了。希望攝片的時候，我方協助的人們，應常加以注意。</p>
<p>我會在滬西閔行鎭，親眼對見三位外國人，拿著攝影機，在拍攝向陽捉虱的乞丐，在拍攝赤膊瘋狂的醫生（賣膏葉），他們的攝片，似乎總選擇這種惡劣對象，不知是何用意？今後春光明媚，公路可通的各鄕鎮，外人的足跡。自必增多，我們但願他們在觀風問俗之餘，傑作誠意的指敎，雅不願欲開玩笑，攝取一角陰暗而的　相。</p>
<p>話說多了，不免離題太遠，要惹起人家誤會的。再侖比亞公司攝取本市外景，當然與專尋玩笑對象的攝影不同，　且「盜庫銀」，是以世界各國合作禁毒為主題，該片的　，對於我國禁毒前途，或有很大的補助。我們樂觀厥成，拭目等待該片的放映。</p>

<h3>Stabilization Plan for Gold Notes and Commodity Prices to be Implemented Soon; Chairman Convenes Meeting with All Parties</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] The Supreme National Defense Council has scheduled a temporary meeting for the 14th at 9:00 AM to discuss issues such as suppressing commodity prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] Chairman Chiang summoned Song Ziwen, Yu Hongjun, Wang Yunwu, Xiao Zheng, Huang Bodu, and others to his official residence at noon on the 11th to inquire about the current financial and fiscal situation. He instructed them to quickly formulate plans for suppressing commodity prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods and to implement them as soon as possible. The Ministry of Economic Affairs will be in charge of this matter, and it was decided to telegraph Wu Guozhen, Wu Kaixian, Shu Yunjun, and the person in charge of the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee to come to Nanjing for a meeting within days. A plan will be decided in the shortest possible time and implemented immediately.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] Song Ziwen received Bei Zuyi at his residence on the morning of the 12th after Bei arrived in Nanjing that morning. He listened to a report on the turbulent financial situation in Shanghai. At 10:00 AM, he summoned Yu Hongjun, the American financial advisor to the Ministry of Finance, and Bei Zuyi to hold a meeting to discuss countermeasures, which lasted until noon. In the afternoon, Xu Baiyuan and others continued to visit and discuss the matter. It is reported that Song will go to Shanghai that night and make a final decision on the countermeasures based on the actual situation in Shanghai. It is said that Song visited the Chairman in the afternoon to report on the countermeasures. Furthermore, Bei Zuyi is scheduled to return to Shanghai with Song on the night of the 12th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] According to a senior official who participated in the temporary meeting convened by Song Ziwen on the 11th, plans to suppress commodity prices are being studied separately by all relevant parties and will be presented soon. The senior officials will continue to meet in the coming days. When asked by reporters whether a new organization would be established to handle this matter, he replied that an organization might be established if needed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The authorities have made concrete decisions on effective measures to suppress the current financial fluctuations. An important meeting was held at Premier Song's residence on the morning of the 12th, with Minister Yu Hongjun and Central Bank Governor Bei Zuyi participating. These effective measures will be implemented within days, and the prices of gold and US dollars are bound to fall again.</p>
<p>Central Standing Committee Resolves to Establish Economic Policy Research Association</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] The Central Standing Committee convened a routine meeting at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 12th, with more than 30 members of the Standing Committee attending. President Chiang himself presided over the meeting. Song Ziwen was unable to attend because he was holding a meeting with Bei Zuyi and others at his residence at the same time. The meeting first discussed various routine cases, including the passage of the Organizational Law of the Central Election Guidance Committee. Then, the President inquired about the recent gold and banknote turmoil and commodity price fluctuations and solicited opinions. He instructed the government to care for the people's livelihood and that appropriate measures had been decided upon and could be used to suppress the fluctuations. Subsequently, Standing Committee member Pan Wei-zhan reported on the financial market in Shanghai and the lurking manipulative elements and presented his opinions. Liu Jianqun, Lai Lian, He Zhonghan, and others then spoke in succession. Finally, it was decided to re-examine the current economic policy and to organize a committee by the Central Government, consisting of seven or eight Central Committee members, to be established as soon as possible to determine policies. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM. In other news, in addition to the Central Committee appointing several Central Committee members to serve as members of the Economic Policy Research Committee to be established, it will also invite well-known figures from the industrial and commercial sectors to join.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] According to a senior government official, the current gold rush has caused a general rise in commodity prices, which the government is paying close attention to. They are currently seeking appropriate measures to separate gold from commodity prices, so that it loses its connection. As for rumors that the government will adopt measures to nationalize gold and suspend gold trading, the former has already been proposed by the Legislative Yuan, and the latter is quite possible.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] Official sources stated tonight that the government has decided to stop the circulation of US dollars and restrict the open trading of gold. These decisions will be implemented as soon as they are approved by Chairman Chiang. As for the gold nationalization plan proposed by some members at yesterday's Legislative Yuan meeting, it will not be implemented.</p>
<h3>Commodity Prices Can Be Naturally Suppressed Based on the Cost of Living Index Over the Years; An Economic Official Analyzes Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] When an economic official analyzed the current commodity price problem to reporters on the morning of the 12th, his views were not as pessimistic as those of the general public. He cited specific figures to show that although commodity prices are rising, they will eventually return to a reasonable path. According to statistics on the commodity price index over the years, commodity prices have risen by an average of 2.7 times per year. Since the "July 7th" Incident, a total of nine years have passed. Goods worth one yuan at that time should now be worth 7,811 yuan (i.e., 2.7 to the power of 9). Before the war, the price of rice in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas was 12 yuan per dan, which multiplied by 7,800 times would be 93,000 yuan. The price of gold was 115 yuan per tael, which should be 897,000 yuan. The current soaring commodity prices, in some respects, have not exceeded this by much. Moreover, according to past experience, commodity prices will inevitably rise in February and March each year, and the rising momentum will weaken after May and June. This phenomenon can be demonstrated by the curve indicated in the commodity price index table over the years. After a period of time, commodity prices will naturally be suppressed. He went on to analyze the impact of commodity prices on the lives of people at all levels, pointing out that workers at that time could earn 8 jiao to 1 yuan per day (one dou of rice), and their current income is more than one dou of rice. Farmers do have various sufferings, but they still have real goods.</p>
<h3>Sharp Drop in Gold Notes in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Gold Drops by 200,000 Yuan per Tael</p>
<p>US Dollars Differ by 500,000 Yuan</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 12th] The price of gold in the capital soared during the day on the 11th, with a great momentum to break through the 1 million mark. However, by the time the market closed in the evening, it had shown signs of fatigue. Because the authorities will take emergency measures to stop the rising trend, speculators were nervous and soft-handed, and they sold off en masse. Since then, the price of gold has plummeted like a flood. When the market opened on the morning of the 12th, some were still quoting 950,000, but the price immediately fell as news of the soft Shanghai price was received. At around 9:00 AM, the bid was 795,000, and the offer was 740,000. An hour later, it rose again, with the bid at 825,000 and the offer at 755,000. At around 11:00 AM, it fell again, with the bid at 765,000 and the offer at 695,000. At 12:00 PM, the bid was 745,000 and the offer was 675,000. At 1:00 PM, the bid was 715,000 and the offer was 645,000. In the evening, there were continued ups and downs. At closing, the bid was 680,000 and the offer was 640,000. The surging gold wind has gradually subsided, but the rise in commodity prices triggered by the gold wind has already become impossible to reverse. For example, the rise in rice and grain prices has already become irreversible. It is reported that the government will take effective measures, and if they can be implemented in the short term, commodity prices should be able to stabilize.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The market prices of gold and US dollars suddenly fell. On the morning of the 12th, the bid for gold was 715,000 yuan per tael, and the offer was 645,000 yuan, a difference of 200,000 yuan from the 915,000 yuan per tael on the 11th. The fall in the price of US dollars was even greater. On the 12th, the bid for 100 yuan was 1.1 million yuan, and the offer was 1.2 million yuan, a difference of 500,000 yuan from the 1.7 million yuan offered for 100 yuan on the 11th.</p>
<h3>Government Will Take Necessary Steps to Deal with Current Economic Situation; Minister Peng Speaks at Press Conference</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference at 4:00 PM on the 12th. Minister Peng answered important questions from reporters as follows:</p>
<p>Question: What is the reason for the sharp rise in the exchange value of the US dollar in China? Is there a plan to control it, and what is this plan?</p>
<p>Answer: The government is confident and capable of dealing with the economic situation and will continue to take various necessary steps. However, the current economic situation is the result of eight years of war against Japan and two years of unceasing destruction by the Communist Party. The people of the country are now gradually realizing the responsibility that they should bear for deliberately destroying transportation, industry, and mining. We must not harbor any illusions about this anemic state and think that changing the name of the currency, the exchange rate, or the tax rate will have unexpected effects. Only by restoring economic construction as soon as possible and strictly adhering to the creed of diligence and thrift can we achieve a fundamental cure.</p>
<p>Government Reorganization</p>
<p>Question: What proportion of power will be given to minority parties in the reorganization of the government? How much time will it take to complete the reorganization? When will the reorganized government be able to start working?</p>
<p>Answer: All parties will negotiate to participate in the National Government Committee, the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, the Control Yuan, the National Political Council during the transition period, and the Standing Committee of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association. It is difficult to say for sure when the reorganization will be completed.</p>
<p>Hope for Peace</p>
<p>Question: Is there still hope for a peaceful resolution of the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party?</p>
<p>Answer: In the current situation, it is difficult to talk about peace. The Communist Party is attacking the National Army everywhere, partly for the purpose of international propaganda and boosting the morale of its troops after repeated defeats. At the same time, it is doing its best to incite workers to strike, students to boycott classes, and launch so-called "anti-American goods campaigns" and "anti-constitutional movement," in order to create international disputes and panic among the people. However, as the Western saying goes, "Wood is destroyed by fire, but iron is tempered and strengthened." After this hardship, the Chinese National Army will become stronger, just as it did after the war against Japan.</p>
<p>Gold Policy</p>
<p>Question: What is the government's gold policy? Will the Central Bank continue to sell gold? What is the policy on the legal exchange rate? Will other measures be adopted to replace export subsidies?</p>
<p>Answer: Any answer will inevitably have a direct impact on the market, so I beg to be excused from discussing it.</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang's Affair</p>
<p>Question: Will Zhang Xueliang, the mastermind of the Xi'an Incident, be released? Answer: At the end of 1936, Zhang Xueliang was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment by the High Military Tribunal of the Military Affairs Commission for conspiring with accomplices and using violence to coerce superiors. Subsequently, Chairman Chiang requested a special pardon from the National Government. On January 4, 1937, the National Government approved the special pardon and ordered him to be placed under strict supervision by the Military Affairs Commission. This was all because Chairman Chiang had always preserved Zhang and showed him his love. During the war against Japan, Zhang lived in Guizhou, and his family often lived with him and visited him from time to time, which was not prohibited. Last year, he moved to Taipei, and his life is as usual. However, under the current circumstances, the National Government has not yet been able to revoke the order of supervision.</p>

One brigade of the 3rd brigade was completely annihilated on the morning of the 12th. Most of Liu's troops have lost their combat effectiveness, and it is expected that the battle situation on the border of Shandong and Henan will take a sharp turn for the worse within days. Furthermore, some Communist troops north of the Jiaoji Railway are attempting to reinforce the south by crossing the railway, but they have been blocked and are unlikely to succeed.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Office, 12th] The National Army in southwestern Shandong recaptured Shan County at 1:00 PM on the 11th. The Communist troops were routed and retreated to the northwest, and the National Army is following up in pursuit and rapidly advancing towards Chengwu.

A Communist battalion of 600-700 men near Minquan surrendered to the National Army on the 10th, and the situation in eastern Henan is expected to become clear. More than 10,000 remnants of Liu Bocheng's troops south of the Longhai Railway are being encircled and annihilated by the National Army northwest of Ningling.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 12th] After Liu Bocheng's Communist troops fled to the north and south of the Longhai Railway in eastern Henan, the National Army along the railway line strengthened its deployment to deal a heavy blow to the Communist troops when they attacked. The Communist troops, overestimating their capabilities, launched a fierce attack on the National Army in Minquan, Yejiagang, and other places in three directions at 12:00 PM on the night of the 11th. The main force of the 7th column attacked from north and south of the Longhai Railway, the 1st and 2nd columns attacked from southwest of the old Kaocheng, and the main force of the 3rd column and the 6th column attacked from the area north of Liuhe to the west. The total strength of the three routes was more than 40,000, intending to encircle the National Army in Minquan, Yejiagang, and other places. The fighting was extremely fierce on the morning of the 12th. The National Army counterattacked jointly according to the planned plan, and by noon, it had eliminated more than 6,000 Communist troops and their regimental commander. At the same time, a brigade of more than 2,000 men from the 2nd column of the Communist troops rushed into Zhengzhuangzhai (southeast of Yejiazhai) at 10:00 AM. The entire unit was completely surrounded by the National Army's powerful troops. All the Communist troops from the brigade commander down were annihilated. As of the time of the telephone call, the Communist troops there were still being eliminated separately by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Office, 12th] After Liu Bocheng's troops fled, the center of the battle shifted to Shangqiu and north of Ningling, where they are fighting fiercely with the National Army. The Communist troops west of Yongcheng are withdrawing to Bo County, and the Communist troops north of Lingbi are fleeing back to the north of Si County.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 10th] The situation in the border area of Henan and Anhui is gradually returning to normal. After Liu Bocheng's remnant troops fled back to western Shandong, only Zhang Taisheng and Wei Fenglou remained between Bo County, Ninglingwen, Luyi, and Zhecheng, and the National Army is continuing to clear them out.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] A replenishment battalion of the 3rd Column of Liu Bocheng's Communist troops surrendered to the National Army in the area between Minquan and Liuhe on the evening of the 10th. The 1st, 6th, and 7th columns, which had been fleeing in the border area of Henan and Anhui, suffered continuous heavy blows from the National Army, and little remained of them. On the afternoon of the 10th, Yang Yong led them to sneak across the railway and return to western Shandong. They were intercepted by the National Army in Minquan and suffered heavy losses again. Now Liu Bocheng's five columns and an independent brigade, which had come east from southern Hebei, have been routed and lost their organization.</p>
<h3>National Army Enters Lijiazhuang; Suburban Linyi Under Control</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 12th] The National Army in southern Shandong entered Jijiazhuang at 1:00 PM on the 12th, which is 45 li south of Linyi. This place is the five strategic strongholds south of Linyi.

The Communist troops reorganized themselves with a part of Jie Si, Jie Jiu, and the New 63rd Division and stubbornly defended the line. After being fiercely attacked by the National Army, they were unable to resist for more than six hours and retreated in disarray to Linyi.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Office, 12th] The battle situation in southern Shandong is deadlocked. The National Army near Huabu, south of Linyi, is repairing roads and sweeping away scattered Communist troops every day. More than 40,000 Communist troops who fled from Huandunbu to the north continued to move towards Juxian.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Office, 12th] The National Army in Xintai recaptured Aoyangzhen on the 12th. The National Army Wang Yaowu's troops, which recaptured Xintai, swept away the stray Communist troops in the suburbs of Ji City and redeployed.

<h3>11th and 12th War Zones to be Reorganized into Pacification Offices Next Month</h3>
<p>Wang Hongshao Talks About the Current Situation</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 12th] Wang Hongshao, Chief of Staff of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, met with reporters at noon on the 12th and made a statement on the current unstable situation: (1) Although Tong County was once attacked by the Communist troops, it cannot be regarded as a poor defense of Beiping. The security of Beiping is definitely not in danger. Even if the Communist troops intend to attack Beiping, in fact, small groups cannot get out after entering, and large groups cannot get close. The reason why Tong County was attacked was because there were too few defending troops and because of negligence. Responsible agencies have now been strictly ordered to pay attention and take mutual defense measures. Although it cannot be guaranteed that similar incidents will never happen again in the future, it can be said with certainty that the situation is becoming safer. (2) The Communist troops in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway greatly disturbed the Baoshi section, leaving the Pingbao section empty. The National Army took the opportunity to recapture Yixian, and Mancheng can also be recaptured recently. However, since neither side is sure to win the city, it is not difficult to recapture it. Whether the Baoshi section will be opened up in the future depends on whether the Pingbao section can be secured. (3) The reorganization of the 11th and 12th war zones into pacification offices has been ordered and can be realized next month. There will not be many changes in personnel. (4) Daming was a voluntary withdrawal by the National Army.</p>
<h3>Baoding's City Defense is Secure; Communist Troops Outside the City are Being Transferred North</h3>

Song told reporters that the Pingbao Road is becoming stable, and the current military focus is on protecting the road. Although the situation in Baoding is tight, the city defense is secure. To open up the Baoshi section is a just and urgent action. To remove the threat to Tianjin and Baoding, it is necessary to clear the Tianjin-Baoding triangle area. Furthermore, there are no changes in the battles in western Hebei. The two armies are in a stalemate northwest of Qicun in Mancheng. The Communist troops surrounding Baoding are being transferred north one after another in an attempt to intercept the National Army going south in Yixian.</p>

<h3>The US Concerned About China's Economy Considers the Possibility of Waiving Additional Taxes on Subsidized Exports</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 12th Broadcast: China's export subsidy method is currently not feasible due to US tariff rules. The US is considering remedial measures to stabilize China's currency system. The US government is awaiting a report from the US Consul General in Shanghai, Davis, and will make a decision on the 13th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] A State Department spokesperson said that the US government is increasingly concerned about China's deepening economic crisis. The State Department is closely monitoring all developments in China, receiving constant reports from the US Embassy in China and the Consul General in Shanghai, but is unwilling to announce the nature of these reports.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] US government officials stated today that the US tariff decision of 1930 has greatly hampered China's export subsidy plan, and the US is now considering the possibility of canceling this decision. However, the extent to which this move will help curb inflation is questionable. The US Consul General in Shanghai, Davis, may announce the US Treasury Department's decision on the 13th.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 11th] Reliable government sources say that many government officials here believe that Chinese exporters subsidized by the Chinese government should be exempted from the additional taxes stipulated in the Tariff Act of 1930. It is said that the US Treasury Department will decide within 24 hours whether to grant this exemption. Some officials have explicitly requested the government to exempt Chinese goods from additional taxes, and the United States has in the past exempted allied nations facing economic difficulties from additional taxes, so there is a precedent. They also believe that this move could improve the current severe economic crisis in Shanghai. Other officials insist that the Tariff Act of 1930 cannot be arbitrarily violated without special congressional approval, but they also believe that if the Chinese government's subsidy of its exporters is not a true subsidy but a disguised exchange rate adjustment, then there may indeed be a possibility of waiving the additional tax.</p>
<p>Officials from various departments of the US government discussed this issue again last night and this morning but are unwilling to predict the outcome. The issue will ultimately be decided by the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Bank. Proponents of waiving the additional tax say that taking this measure now is not excessive in order to restore Chinese exporters as soon as possible and stabilize China's economic situation, but if a decision cannot be made soon, it will be too late.</p>
<h3>Supreme National Defense Council Convenes Extraordinary Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The Supreme National Defense Council is scheduled to convene an extraordinary meeting at 9:00 AM on the 14th to discuss issues such as stabilizing prices and ensuring people's livelihoods.</p>

<p>Ye Jianying Bids Farewell to Peiping Reporters, Will Issue Statement on Military Mediation Department Work</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 12th] Ye Jianying attended a press conference hosted by the Communist Party News Agency today to bid farewell to the Peiping press corps. Ye analyzed the war situation and political situation from the Communist Party's point of view. In general, he believed that the Battle of Xuzhou, which would determine the outcome of the war, could be fought decisively, quickly, or as a protracted war, depending on how the commanders of both sides viewed the situation at the time. Regarding the political situation, he said: "After February and March, the military situation will change, and peace can be expected to be re-established." When asked whether the Communist Party would insist on restoring its military position as of January 13th of last year, and whether it had the confidence to achieve this goal in terms of military strength, or would use indirect methods to accomplish it, Ye replied: "The military position at midnight on January 13th can be said to exist, and it can be said not to exist. Of course, we can draw a map of this position, but if the two parties can establish political understanding and the Kuomintang agrees to this condition, then the Communist Party does not necessarily have to realize this condition, and then the so-called military position of January 13th will be useless." Regarding the work of the Military Mediation Department over the past year, he will issue a statement, and is currently consulting with Yan'an on the content.</p>
<p>Li Denghui Advocates Peace, Says Current Need is Unconditional Ceasefire</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Dr. Li Denghui, 75 years old, who has been engaged in education for 50 years and has never asked about foreign affairs, is now one of the five conveners of the peace movement. At a time when the financial situation is chaotic, prices are soaring, and people are extremely uneasy, a reporter visited Dr. Li at his residence and was received by him. The questions and answers are as follows:</p>
<p>Q: Prices have been rising recently, and people are unusually uneasy. What are your thoughts?</p>
<p>A: The country's situation has reached this point, and it is truly serious and regrettable. If it is not resolved fundamentally, there is no solution. I believe that all problems are tied to peace. To stabilize finances, it must begin with the realization of peace.</p>
<p>Q: Besides achieving peace, are there any other methods?</p>
<p>A: Everything must start with peace.</p>
<p>Q: What is the motivation for you and others to launch the peace movement?</p>
<p>A: I believe that today's China, without peace, nothing can be discussed. Months ago, I wanted to make this appeal as a citizen. Recently, I spoke with many friends and classmates, as well as leaders in the industrial and commercial sectors, and they all shared the same sentiment, so we jointly launched this national salvation movement. I believe that since the War of Resistance, there has not been a national salvation movement that meets the urgent needs of the entire nation, which is the peace movement.</p>
<p>Q: What is the goal of the peace movement?</p>
<p>A: Immediate unconditional ceasefire.</p>
<p>Q: Besides public opinion appeals, are there any other effective methods for the peace movement?</p>
<p>A: The eight-year history of the War of Resistance demonstrates that once the national will and conscience are concentrated on a single, simple goal, its power is sufficient to exceed any tangible power in the world. If the majority unanimously demands peace and does not encourage war, I believe that no one can fail to obey peace.</p>
<p>Q: Then how can the national will be concentrated on peace?</p>
<p>A: If there is no favoritism and no purpose other than peace, who would not agree? This is the purpose of the peace movement.</p>
<p>Q: You and others advocate an unconditional ceasefire, but can there be peace without conditions?</p>
<p>A: Unconditional ceasefire is the people's demand. As for what conditions are required by both sides, that is their business. We have no intention of interfering with their conditions, but we hope that they will not harm the public interest.</p>
<p>Q: The peace movement advocates not questioning past right and wrong, and some people disagree. What do you think?</p>
<p>A: During wartime, discussing right and wrong is biased. We advocate that today's right is peace, and other right and wrong can wait until after the ceasefire.</p>
<p>Q: There is a lot of speculation about the peace movement. Have you heard anything?</p>
<p>A: Just ask whether peace is needed and wait for the facts to prove it.</p>
<p>Q: Do you and others intend to mediate peace?</p>
<p>A: Today, we are appealing to the conscience of our countrymen. We have not yet appealed to the warring parties.</p>
<p>Q: Does the peace movement not welcome other parties to participate?</p>
<p>A: This is not entirely true. We do not ask about parties, but whether they agree with the peace declaration. Free members of all parties, and those who have occupations and prioritize peace, unconstrained by party opinions, we welcome to participate.</p>
<p>Q: How do you view the future of this movement?</p>
<p>A: I deeply believe that the peace movement will succeed. At this point, the gentleman, in a sincere tone, sent the reporter out the door and said, "I am old, but I hope to see a peaceful and prosperous China after the victory. I deeply hope that my younger friends, in addition to their own professions, will unanimously make peace their greatest goal and promote its realization as soon as possible, so that you will enjoy the happiness and glory of peace for much longer than I."</p>
<h3>Nanking City Council Provisional Meeting Passes Declaration on Current Situation</h3>
<p>Advocates Expanding the Foundation of Government</p>

<h3>Democratic Socialist Party Holds Meetings Yesterday and Today to Discuss Candidates for Government Participation, Youth Party Central Standing Committee Discusses Internal Affairs</h3>
<p>[This City Report] The Democratic Socialist Party held a meeting yesterday (12th) afternoon. Because of insufficient numbers, it was temporarily changed to a discussion meeting. It was decided to continue holding a meeting this afternoon to discuss and decide on candidates to participate in the Legislative Yuan, Supervisory Yuan, Political Participation Council, and Constitutional Government Promotion Association. A certain key member of the party told reporters last night that the discussion meeting discussed who was more suitable to participate in which institution, but no conclusions were reached. The list of personnel participating in the four government institutions will be decided at the meeting tomorrow (13th), and then Jiang Yuntian will take it to Nanjing to submit to the government. It is not yet known whether Zhang Junli will accompany him to Nanjing. The list decided tomorrow is not the final list, because possible participants are scattered at home and abroad. The party headquarters has sent telegrams to each of them to seek their consent. Before the replies arrive, it is naturally not possible to give consent on their behalf, but the majority of participants can still be decided tomorrow. It is said that the Democratic Socialist Party has a total of 34 places to participate in the four government institutions, including 12 in the Legislative Yuan, 6 in the Supervisory Yuan, 11 in the Political Participation Council, and 5 in the Constitutional Government Promotion Association. As for whether they will soon participate in the National Government Committee, the Executive Yuan, and local governments, it has not yet been decided. It is also learned that the Democratic Socialist Party plans to issue a statement within days to explain the reasons for participating in the four government institutions, believing that this move will benefit the promotion of constitutionalism and the promotion of peace.</p>
<p>[This City Report] Sun Baogang, commissioned by the Democratic Socialist Party, is the director of the Shanghai branch and is in charge of the party affairs of the Shanghai party.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 11th] The Shanghai headquarters of the Democratic Socialist Party sent a letter to Hu Haimen and Yang Qiushui, asking them to go south to discuss the issue of participating in the government. Hu and Yang had just returned to Peiping and had not even had time to settle down, so they have indicated that they do not intend to return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Youth Party held a meeting of the Central Standing Committee yesterday, focusing on internal work and agreeing to pay attention to the restoration of party affairs in various places. According to a certain key member who told reporters, someone has recently been using the name of the director of the Youth Party's Shanghai office to conduct activities outside. The Standing Committee has decided to issue a public statement to correct this. Regarding the party's participation in the government, a final decision can only be made after the Standing Committee members stranded in Nanjing return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The 125 members of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association were originally planned to be decided, with one-quarter divided between the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party, and three-quarters distributed among the Kuomintang, social figures, women, overseas Chinese, and other 49 units. It is now learned that the three-quarter quota, totaling 93 places, will have one person per unit for each of the 49 units, and the remaining 44 places will be selected by each unit.</p>

In addition to the impact of the War of Resistance, epidemics are also a major cause, such as the "8" shaped disease in De'an, the blood-sucking disease in Xingzi, and the plague in Nancheng. As of last month, the total population of Nanchang City was 203,101, a decrease of about 100,000 compared to before.</p>
<h3>Zhou Fohai's Wife's Appeal Still Rejected</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanking, 12th] After the traitor Zhou Fohai was sentenced to death, his wife, Yang Shuhui, filed another appeal, requesting a retrial. On the 12th, it was rejected by the Supreme Court. The main text: "Zhou Yang Shuhui's appeal for a retrial of Zhou Fohai's traitor case is rejected."</p>
<h3>Original Text of the Reasons for the Judgment Against Traitor Ding Mocun Continued from Yesterday</h3>
<p>Purely Empty Words</p>
<p>Moreover, after the defendant arrived in Shanghai at the end of 1938, within two or three weeks, he had a relationship with Li Shiqun (see the court record of November 19, 1946). This further confirms that the claim in the Fourth Seven Three One Public Document of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Commission of the previous army: "Ding Mocun served as the director of the puppet Special Ding Headquarters from the spring of 1939 to March 1940" is true. The defendant's claim that he only joined the special forces in the autumn of 1939 is obviously unbelievable, even though the defendant claimed that Hu Junhe fabricated the facts because of his refusal to allow Hu Junhe to go to Zhejiang to work, however, the investigation revealed that it was purely empty words and not sufficient to be taken as evidence. As for the letters presented by the defendant from Zhao Binggu on November 25, 1946, and Jiang Bocheng on November 7, 1946, proving that the activities of the 76th were often manipulated by Li Shiqun, Wu Shishi, etc., however, the investigation revealed that Jiang Bocheng obtained this information from hearsay (see his reply on December 9, 1946), and Zhao Binggu was also not an insider of the 76th, so he naturally had no way of knowing. This kind of evidence is difficult to accept. Moreover, according to Yu Runzhi's brother Yu Nanyang's testimony: in March 1939, Ding Mocun once said to Yu Runzhi, "Your father used to be a prosecutor at the Gao Er Branch, why don't you participate in the Peace Movement? If you insist on not participating in the Peace Movement, the 76th will take your father's life." In November of the same year, after Yu Huaguo was arrested by the 76th, Ding said to my sister, "Kill Yu Huaguo to show the monkeys" (see the interrogation record of the Shanghai High Court on December 11, 1946). This is consistent with the various newspapers presented by Yu Yin, which recorded the situation at the time. It is clear that Yu Hua's assassination was instigated by the traitor Ding Mocun.</p>
<p>Testimony Difficult to Believe</p>
<p>Regarding the murder of Zheng Pingru, the Public Letter No. 5167 of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang is sufficient to prove that Zheng Pingru's arrest and death were related to the exposure of Ding Mocun's plan to lure and kill him. The defendant was in charge of the 76th at the time, and the arrest and killing were undoubtedly carried out by him. The defendant shirked responsibility onto the Japanese invaders, and his defense has no value in accepting it as evidence. Furthermore, eight underground workers from the Military Intelligence Bureau were killed. The location of the killings was in Shanghai, and the date of the killings was also during the defendant's tenure as the director of the puppet Special Forces Headquarters. Moreover, the bureau has provided clear evidence, making it difficult for the defendant to deny it. There is also the New Year Special Edition of the puppet Central Daily News in 1944, which can be used as evidence, and the evidence is conclusive. Although Heng Shiwu and Cheng Denzhi both participated in puppet organizations, their testimony is difficult to believe. Even if it is considered true, it is not sufficient to prove that the article was drafted by the puppet Propaganda Department and published in the defendant's name. This defense is also not sufficient to accept as evidence.</p>
<p>Regarding the third point: The Public Letter No. 235 of the Chinese Kuomintang Zhejiang Provincial Executive Committee, dated December 17, 1946, has the effect of an official document. The defendant did not provide accurate evidence proving it to be untrue, and it is consistent with the situation in other provincial governments and puppet provincial party departments at the time, so it should be presumed to be true. Regarding the fourth point, according to Cheng Gongshu's report, the puppet Assault Brigade was discovered in Songjiang and Shaoxing. The Songjiang part was scattered because it did not contact the local enemy army, and the Shaoxing part was dispersed or revolted after the Japanese surrender. This is sufficient to prove that the defendant's claim that "the Assault Brigade has never been established due to lack of funds and other items" is not true. Cheng Gongshu's report can also prove that the purpose of the defendant's organization of the Assault Brigade was to engage in guerrilla warfare after the Allied forces landed on the coast of eastern Zhejiang. As for his claim that it was to prepare to meet the central counter-offensive, it is purely empty words and cannot be accepted as evidence.</p>
<p>In summary, none of the reasons given by the defendant in his defense can be established. The defendant's collusion with the enemy to plot against the country is undeniable and should be held liable for the crime of Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. Although he committed many crimes, they all stemmed from the same intention of "colluding with the enemy to plot against the country" and are absorbed into the same crime of treason, so there is no need to punish them separately.

<p>Special Commentary</p>
<h3>The Low Tide of China's Foreign Relations</h3>
<p>— Dong Lin</p>
<p>Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, we have missed the opportunity for peaceful unification, idly talked for more than a year, and the opposition parties have not yet cooperated with the central government. A unified national government has not been formed, coupled with the scramble for territory and the civil war, not only has the domestic political economy been paralyzed, but to this day, we have fallen into a low tide of foreign relations.</p>
<p>During this World War, China single-handedly shouldered the arduous task in the Far East. Although it suffered repeated military defeats, it long contained the majority of Japan's forces, giving the United States a chance to breathe and organize its army for the eastern expedition. Various countries recognized China's contribution to this war, so its international status was steadily rising, leaping from a semi-colony to one of the four powers. Looking back at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in the United States, France's national strength was still very weak. However, because of its traditional geographical relationship in Europe, it was later included in the ranks of the great powers, but ranked fifth. Unfortunately, we failed to seize the opportunity. As a result of more than a year of civil war, we lost the precious seat of one of the four powers. On the contrary, France strove to become stronger, catching up and replacing China's position. Now, the four powers mentioned in newspapers refer to the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France, and the term "five powers" is rarely used anymore; sometimes even seeing the phrase "the four powers and China," which is such a sad thing! In the middle of the London Five Foreign Ministers Conference, the Soviet Union suddenly objected to China's participation in the discussion of European affairs. Later, at the Paris Peace Conference, China was not listed as one of the invited countries; the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to be held in Moscow also has no opportunity for China to participate. Although it is said that China cannot assume the important responsibility of discussing European peace because it did not actually fight against Germany, Italy, and other countries, is the underlying reason not because our internal disunity has reduced our voice in international politics? In recent years, the evolution of China's international status has been truly frightening. Now, analyzing the relationship between various countries and us, there is even more of a feeling of "the unjust have few supporters"! From the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War to the present, China has always received the sympathy and assistance of the United States. After the war, the issue of the Nationalists and Communists became unsolvable, and the United States volunteered to send General Marshall to China to mediate; after spending more than a year and trying various methods, it hoped that China could complete a unified and democratic country. In the end, we disappointed people. Following General Marshall's return to the United States, the U.S. mediation mission was declared over, and now it has announced the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in China. Although this cannot be said to be a change in the U.S. policy towards China, it seems to have adopted a wait-and-see attitude at present.</p>
<p>Britain, which enjoys significant interests in the Far East, also has a very weak relationship with us. Since the "September 18th Incident," Britain, because of its alliance with Japan, has taken a passive attitude towards our appeals in the League of Nations. Later, because the United States' Far East policy became increasingly tough, and Japan's territorial expansion showed signs of expanding from the mainland to Southeast Asia, Britain deepened its sympathy for China; however, actual assistance was relatively rare. It was not until the sudden outbreak of the Pacific War that China and Britain shared a common hatred of the enemy, and the alliance turned closer. However, due to the different geographical environments of China and Britain, they had different views on the strategy of which to defeat first, Germany or Japan; and because each was preoccupied with its own affairs, there was not much mutual assistance during the war. This was not due to the weakness of the Sino-British relationship, but due to the situation, and what could Britain do? After the war, Britain was troubled by European problems, and the handling of issues such as India and Palestine was also tricky, so it had the suffering of being too far away to help China. Unfortunately, recently, there has been a sudden occurrence of discussions about interfering in China in the parliament, which has given us a deep shock. The strange theory of Labour MP Lord Lindsay not only obliterated the friendship between China and Britain but also insulted our sovereignty. Lindsay's prejudice was due to immature observation and was refuted by the leaders of various parties, but it reminded us that we should promptly strengthen mutual understanding between the two countries. International friendship either advances or retreats, and the current stage of Sino-British relations seems not active enough.</p>
<p>With the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, China recognized the independence of Outer Mongolia and granted the Soviet Union special rights in Lushun (Port Arthur) and Dalian. The reason why we made such a major concession was that China and the Soviet Union are adjacent to each other, and ensuring peace in East Asia after the war depended on close understanding between the two countries. But as things stand now, Dalian has still not been taken over; Chinese people cannot help but have doubts about the Soviet Union's sincerity. Some argue that the Soviet Union's coldness towards China is due to the overly close friendship between the United States and China and the unsatisfactory resolution of the Nationalist-Communist issue. The United States and the Soviet Union often have disputes over post-war issues, so they suspected the U.S. military presence in China and the mediation efforts, reflecting China's policy of being close to the United States and distant from the Soviet Union. In fact, China's pro-American stance is indeed a fact, but being pro-American does not necessarily mean distancing from the Soviet Union; on the contrary, we hope that both the United States and the Soviet Union are our friends, without any distinction. As for the participation of the Communist Party in the government, it is not something that the Nationalist Party can unilaterally demand; the relationship of friendship established by the Sino-Soviet Treaty has the obligation to maintain, regardless of which party is in power. Moreover, the previous estrangement of Sino-Soviet relations is too disappointing.</p>
<p>Both China and France suffered the painful experience of being ravaged by the enemies in the East and West during this war; they should have a common desire to help each other revive. After Vietnam was invaded, China did not avoid difficulties and sent troops to help, returning it to France after the war without making any extra demands. This friendship should be understood by the entire country. However, judging from past experiences in international conferences, France often remains silent on our reasonable proposals and rarely supports them, perhaps because they are concerned about their own position and find it difficult to take sides. However, the recent Paracel Islands incident surprised us. Many have discussed that the Paracel Islands originally belonged to our country; there is no need to elaborate. France actually disregarded the facts and claimed that they belonged to Vietnam; the dispute continues to this day, causing an unexpected blow to the traditional friendship between China and France, which is truly regrettable!</p>
<p>Analyzing the individual relations with the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France from a general international perspective fully demonstrates the current distress of China's foreign relations. However, although we are distressed, we are not despondent. Our international status was earned through a long and bloody war, and it was not achieved by luck; nor will we allow anyone to squeeze or ridicule us at any moment because of temporary internal political disputes. The Four Foreign Ministers Conference is about to be held in Moscow, and we must warn the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France that since China is not participating in the conference, it should not discuss proposals directly or indirectly related to China. If there are any, China will definitely not be bound by them, and it will set a bad precedent for international relations, invisibly burying explosives that will destroy peace. We believe that the friendship between China and the United States is always sincere and unwavering. A strong China is a stabilizing force for peace in the Far East and even world peace. China is facing an economic crisis and undoubtedly hopes that the United States will lend money to help us revive. Britain and France have no fundamental conflict of interest with China, and we hope that they will all think from a long-term and broad perspective and strengthen the friendly relations that have always existed. China and the Soviet Union are neighbors, and good-neighborly friendship should be a common hope. However, international friendship cannot be achieved unilaterally; we hope that everyone will take steps to implement the basic spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance.</p>
<p>Looking at history, the rise and fall of national power in various countries is wave-shaped, and it cycles in a circle of prosperity followed by decline, and decline followed by prosperity. China is currently experiencing many difficulties, but these difficulties can precisely invigorate the country; we can also test who are true friends from the difficult environment!</p>
<p>Finally, we must not forget the ancient saying that "a country must first be attacked by itself before others attack it." The current low tide of foreign relations is not due to the improper actions of the diplomatic authorities, but because our internal affairs are too disappointing. We hope that everyone will wake up and unite, remembering "brothers quarrel at home but unite against external threats," and rise up together to rescue our beloved motherland from the international low tide!</p>

<h3>Strict Prevention of Abuses in this Year's Conscription, Careful Preparation Underway, Commander Fu Zhengmo Speaks in Suzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 12th] Lieutenant General Fu Zhengmo, commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, along with staff members such as Chief of the Conscription Section Colonel Zhou Yuqun, arrived in Suzhou around 8:00 AM on the 12th. He first visited the Wu County Garrison District Headquarters for inspection. At 1:00 PM, he went to the Commissioner's Office to visit Commissioner Xu, where they discussed conscription issues. At 3:00 PM, he returned to the headquarters and summoned all officers for instruction. Around 6:00 PM, he met with our reporter and answered various inquiries. A brief account is as follows: The formal conscription for the 36th year (1947) is currently still in the preparation stage, which is divided into four stages: (1) background investigation, (2) exemption review, (3) physical examination, and (4) lottery distribution. This preparation work will be completed around May, and the exact date of conscription will be determined by the order of the Ministry of National Defense. During the past temporary conscription period, the phenomenon of unqualified men substituting for conscripts was not uncommon. The crux of the problem was the lack of preparation work. To fundamentally prevent this from happening, a plan is in place to affix a hard seal on the photos attached to the background investigation form to prevent abuses. If such abuses still occur, severe punishment will be imposed in accordance with the Regulations on Punishment for Obstructing Military Service. The implementation of this formal military service is not for conscripting soldiers for combat, but rather its purpose is to train them. Therefore, even if someone is the only son in a family, if there is no consistent proof from local political, military, or legal entities that they are responsible for supporting the family, they will not be exempted from conscription. The so-called exemption review only refers to disabled or studying citizens. However, if a family's sole heir who has completed their military service and been discharged is recalled for war, they will still be entitled to deferment. Regarding the conscription age, the legal age is 20, but if the quota is not met, young people aged 21 or 22 may be used to fill the quota. The selection method is as follows: if the number of people who pass the physical examination exceeds the quota, a lottery will be used to determine the order. The number of people conscripted is entirely based on the population of each area. The basic training of recruits is fully coordinated with the training of regular troops, and there will be no separate training. Regarding the term of service, it is two years for infantry and three years for special forces. The method of participation is based on the recruit's physical and knowledge level and their willingness to choose. Currently, in order to encourage conscripted youth, the central government has issued an order from the Ministry of Education that all discharged soldiers who wish to study in secondary schools or higher will be exempt from fees to show preferential treatment. Therefore, military service is an obligation to the country, but it is also an honor for oneself. The reporter then asked what the important points of the military service review meeting were. Fu said that because of time constraints, it was postponed to the 13th. The participants were the administrative commissioners, the county magistrates of Suzhou, Yushun, and Wu counties, the military section chiefs, public representatives, party members, etc. The focus of the review was on the shortcomings of the temporary conscription of the 35th year (1946), the central objectives of the conscription of the 36th year (1947), and any difficulties. It is learned that Fu will return to Shanghai via Songjiang on the 14th.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Assembly Closes, Calls for Peace in Telegram</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch] The Jiangsu Provincial Provisional Assembly closed on the 12th and issued two telegrams calling for peace. The original text of the telegrams is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government of Nanjing: During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, thanks to Your Excellency's persevering spirit, you led the national army and people in a united struggle, and finally won the final victory. We were looking forward to long-term peace and stability and moving towards the path of national reconstruction. Unfortunately, for more than a year, the domestic turmoil has not subsided, the people's livelihood has become increasingly dilapidated, the door to peace has been opened and closed from time to time, and the international status has been invisibly lowered. Until the CCP firmly refused to negotiate and the mediator quietly withdrew, the spreading flames of war became increasingly difficult to control. Looking forward to the future, our hearts are filled with worry. The members of this assembly, on behalf of the 36 million people of the province, request that Your Excellency continue to uphold the consistent sincerity in seeking peace and the initial intention of broad tolerance, and give the Communist Party another opportunity to reconsider. Appoint key personnel to quickly resume peace talks, cease fire on the spot, resolve political issues through political means, reorganize the government as soon as possible, and implement constitutional government, so as to save the country from peril and rescue the people from fire and water. The telegram expresses our urgent hope.</p>
<p>(2) To Mr. Mao Zedong in Yan'an: After the victory of the War of Resistance, everything is waiting to be rebuilt. Unexpectedly, the internal conflict broke out again, the cause of national reconstruction was interrupted, and the war continued to spread, with the sound of killing shaking the sky and blood flowing in the fields. The countryside is bankrupt, industry and commerce are declining, goods are blocked on the way, treasures are abandoned on the ground, people's livelihood is insecure, social order is chaotic, international status is declining, and the victorious reputation is gradually lost. The foundation of the country, which was shaken by the brutal Japanese, is about to be lost in internal strife. Thinking about the future, we cannot help but feel terrified! We, on behalf of the 36 million people of Jiangsu Province, implore you with tears: The most important thing for the country is unity, and the most urgent thing for national reconstruction is peace. Parties cannot be independent from the country, and doctrines cannot be pursued alone by force. If your party does not want to win the love of the people, then so be it. If you want to win the love of the people, now is the best opportunity! We believe that with your insight, you will be able to understand the people, pull back from the brink, return the army to the country, resolutely seek peace, move the battlefield to the negotiating table, and turn hostility into friendship, so that the country's lifeline will not be severed and constitutional government can be realized. The telegram is urgent, and we hope for a reply!</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Requests Allocation of Brick and Tile Making Machines</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 12th] The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) recently shipped eight brick and tile machines to China to revive China's construction. The number of units urgently requesting allocation from various provinces has reached more than thirty. It is heard that the Executive Yuan will allocate two units to the Communist-controlled areas. The Zhejiang sub-office has strongly protested this, because this type of machinery should be allocated based on the degree of housing destruction and application conditions in various places. The houses damaged in Zhejiang Province total more than 908,000 rooms, second only to Hunan in the country. In terms of application, Xiaoshan and Jiashan both have electricity, which is sufficient, and therefore should be allocated to Zhejiang, rather than to the Communist-controlled areas which have lighter losses and no power to operate the machines. Sun Zengzhang will go to Shanghai in the next few days to negotiate on this matter.</p>
<h3>Three Urgent Telegrams in One Day, Suzhou's Emergency Measures on Prices, Resuming Price Controls and Purchase Limits</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 12th] The prices in this county have soared, and the rising trend has not yet been curbed. The Jiangsu Provincial Government is extremely concerned and sent three urgent telegrams to the county government on the 12th, strictly ordering that prices be stabilized and lowered, especially for grain prices, admonishing them to use any means necessary to suppress prices and find ways to dredge the grain supply. In addition to deciding to convene relevant agencies on the 13th together with the city defense department to discuss concrete measures, the county social affairs department formulated three emergency measures: (1) immediately restore price controls and stipulate the amount of purchases allowed per person, (2) prevent incitement, and (3) labor-management disputes must not be used as an excuse to promote unrest. The General Labor Union here also urgently telegraphed the provincial social affairs department for instructions, while also advising workers to be patient and wait for relief in order to fight the labor unrest.</p>
<h3>A Lustful Monk Expelled, Suspected of Murder, Clues Seem to Point to a Killing</h3>
<p>[Our Jiangyin Dispatch] There is a temple called Jue'an on Junshan Mountain outside the north of Jiangyin, presided over by a monk named Jinghua. Because he did not abide by the monastic rules and was fond of women, the local gentry gathered last winter and decided that his disciple Daocheng would take over the temple. Jinghua suddenly disappeared, and his disciple suspected that he had gone to Shanghai. On the morning of the 10th, Jinghua's body was suddenly found in the pool in front of the temple. After someone reported it to the police station and the town office, they sent people to investigate. The monk's neck was tied with a lamp cord, his upper body was bound with hemp rope, and large stones were tied to his feet. It was determined that he had been murdered and sunk into the pool. When the monks in the temple were questioned, they all said that they did not know the cause of death. Later, the police station found clues and interrogated Chen Xiuying, who had an affair with the deceased, and Wang Jinlong, who ran a platform. Because Chen Xiuying had another lover who was the captain of the special service team of the naval training team and had gone to Guangzhou, Jinghua had a love rivalry with him, which was very related. The police station sent the suspects to the police station for judicial investigation and decided to conduct an inspection on the 11th.</p>

<h3>202nd Division Plans to Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch] Recently, the bandit forces in northern Jiangsu collapsed, and the remaining small groups have been moving south, seemingly attempting to infiltrate southern Jiangsu. The 202nd Division of the Youth Army stationed in Suzhou, in addition to ordering its subordinates to strictly block and suppress them, has also decided to launch the second phase of suppression within a very short period in coordination with political and economic measures, with a planned period of three months.</p>
<h3>Execution of Jaru Haruki</h3>
<p>Families of Victims in Bensho Request Execution in Taicang</p>
<p>[Our Taicang Dispatch] Jaru Haruki, the main culprit in the Jiangnan Massacre, has been sentenced to death by the Shanghai Military Tribunal. Ouyang Yunfang, the wife of Wang Xueliang, a local resident and a victim's family member, and fifteen others specifically submitted a petition to the county authorities, stating in brief: "The main culprit of the Jiangnan Massacre, Jaru Haruki, was sentenced to death by the Shanghai Military Tribunal on January 6 and is awaiting execution. However, the whereabouts of the victims are still unknown and they cannot be returned to their bones, which is regrettable. The family members are heartbroken and can only petition Your Honor to unite with various associations and request the Shanghai Military Tribunal to escort him to Taicang for execution. On one hand, before the execution, we hope to induce him to confess the dates and locations of the victims so that their bones can be returned. On the other hand, executing him in Taicang can greatly satisfy the people."</p>

<h3>The Evil Habit of Forcibly Pushing Carts Across Bridges</h3>
<p>Here, I, the writer, will point out something related to the general public that must be reformed: I am a woman, and whenever I sit alone in a rickshaw crossing the bridges over the Suzhou River, I initially get off and walk a few steps, then get back on in the middle of the bridge. However, every time I refuse the services of these small-time vagrants to push the cart, I am subjected to an unwarranted form of insult. Sometimes they even curse and yell: "Damn it, if you don't let us push, it's too much effort, unbearable..." After that, to avoid such insults, I had to let them push. But even when I give them one or two hundred yuan, they still grumble. If a man were sitting in the cart with me, then this trouble wouldn't happen. Once, I saw with my own eyes a foreign woman sitting alone in a rickshaw, with two pushers holding onto her cart, walking and laughing (though not actually pushing). When they reached the middle of the bridge, both of them demanded money from the foreign woman. She naturally refused to pay double, so the two pushers, one in front blocking the cart and one behind pulling it, stubbornly refused to let the cart go. The foreign woman was so anxious she was about to cry, while the rickshaw driver stood next to the cart without saying a word, and everyone else just went their own way. Because I am a woman myself, I couldn't help, so I had to leave. Yesterday, I encountered something even more intolerable. On the afternoon of February 4th, at 3:30 PM, I was riding in a rickshaw from south to north across Sichuan Road. One pusher insisted on pushing my cart, and I couldn't stop him. When we reached the middle of the bridge, I gave him two hundred yuan. He said, "What's the use of two hundred yuan? Others give fifteen hundred!" I said, "There's no such rule!" He immediately threw the two hundred yuan bill in my face, then ran to the back of the cart. As soon as he let go, the cart started rolling downhill. In that instant, the pusher suddenly yanked my hat and hair with force. Because my hat was double-knotted, it didn't come off completely but was just pulled down, hanging around my neck, but he tore out a handful of hair, causing extreme pain. At that moment, I intended to get out of the cart and grab him, but I didn't see any police officers. I knew that the traffic officers wouldn't leave their posts to catch him. If I chased after him myself, I was afraid I would suffer even more unbearable humiliation, so I endured the pain and went home. I think that this group of raggedly dressed people gathering in the major thoroughfares of the world metropolis—Shanghai—is not only an eyesore and obstructs traffic, but I urge the municipal authorities to resolutely ban them. If the authorities think that banning them is difficult, then extortion and even insults against women must be strictly prohibited. (Meng Xiuzhen)</p>
<h3>Wartime Art and Archaeological Discovery: The Tang and Song Stone Carvings in Dazu County are of Immeasurable Value; Government Orders Increased Protection</h3>
<p>[Chengdu News] The Tang and Song stone carvings in the deep mountains of Dazu County, Sichuan Province, have been hidden for a thousand years, unknown to anyone. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, after Professor Yang Jialuo, the director of the Chinese Classics Library, discovered them, the library organized a national expedition to Dazu stone carvings. Those invited to participate included Ma Heng, He Sui, Gu Yun'gang, Zhuang Yan, Fu Zhenlun, Zhu Jinjiang, and fifteen others. They surveyed and created detailed maps, identified the ages, assigned grotto codes, counted the number of statues, and took rubbings and photographs. The carvings are divided into seven areas: Longgang, Baoxiang, Guanghua, Shucheng, Shimen, Miaogao, and Chengzhuan, containing approximately 20,000 statues. One area extends for about a mile, with continuous carvings. The artistry and scale are unparalleled except for Yungang and Longmen. This is truly a major discovery in art and archaeology during the war. After the discovery, scholars from Britain, the United States, and France visited to see them. The Ministry of Education's China Educational Film Studio also sent film technicians with the expedition to shoot a film called "Dazu Stone Carvings." Recently, Li Shizeng, the chairman of the Chinese Classics Library, sent Professor Yang Jialuo's report, containing over ten thousand words, to relevant authorities, requesting them to quickly seek ways to protect and promote the carvings. The Ministry of the Interior has telegraphed the Sichuan Provincial Government to handle the matter, and the Sichuan Provincial Government has ordered the county magistrate and the speaker of the county council of Dazu County to jointly establish a preservation association with the elders of the county to protect them.</p>
<h3>Gambling Ring Busted in Dangtu</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Dangtu] Since the Spring Festival, gambling has become increasingly rampant in this county. On the evening of the 7th of this month, many gamblers gathered in Tang's residence in Hejia Lane, engaging in large-scale gambling. There was one table each for "pai gow," "single and double points," and "dice stalls," with significant sums of money changing hands. Several gas lamps were hung, as bright as day. Upon receiving a report, the police station dispatched a large number of officers at around midnight on the same day to arrest the gamblers. Sixteen gamblers, including Yang Qing, were arrested on the spot and taken to the station. After interrogation, they were severely punished and fined according to the law for committing crimes against the police.</p>
<h3>Theft at Jiaxing Cinema Involving an Affair</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Pinghu] A projector and a film were stolen from the Guangming Cinema in Jiaxing. The main suspect has been apprehended in room number nine of the Ying'an Inn in this county. The thief, named Shi Liansheng, confessed that it was because a projectionist at the cinema had an affair with his wife and enticed her to run away, with no news of her whereabouts. Furthermore, the projectionist sowed discord, leading to Shi's dismissal. Therefore, he held a grudge and committed the theft by digging open the door of the projection room. The name of the film is "Ice Tree Silver Flower." On the 9th, the criminal and the stolen goods were escorted back to the county by the He Criminal Police Team and handed over to the police station to be sent to the court for trial.</p>
<h3>Severe Damage to the Mingguang-Dingyuan Highway by Bandits</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Mingguang] Duan Jisheng, the manager of the Mingguang Guohua Motor Company, invited reporters and over a dozen employees and workers of the company to travel by car from Mingguang to Dingyuan to survey the road. The road surface was severely damaged along the way, making it rough and difficult to travel. When the car reached Majiagang Town, it could not proceed because the bridge was damaged. The group then walked to the Meijia Bridge before turning back. The bridge was particularly severely damaged and was originally a very large-scale construction project on the Mingguang-Dingyuan highway.</p>

<h3>U.S. State Department and Military Advocate Universal Military Training to Strengthen National Defense; Marshall to Attend Foreign Relations Committee to Argue for It; Joint Committee of Both Houses Discussing New Budget</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 12th (Broadcast): U.S. Army leaders held a secret meeting today and decided to reduce the regular army to 875,000 men, but Congress must pass the universal military training bill. The current Army plan is to reach 1,070,000 men by July 1st.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 11th] Republican Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently announced that Secretary of State Marshall is scheduled to attend a closed-door meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 14th of this month to discuss a topic that cannot be announced.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] Marshall will attend a closed-door meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee tomorrow to report on the importance of soldier quality for national defense. Marshall and the Army and Navy Departments believe that the U.S. national defense is extremely weak, so universal military training is essential for the country, but Congress has resolutely opposed it and may even refuse to consider this year's military training plan at all.</p>
<p>President Truman strongly advocates the speedy implementation of the military training plan, believing that an army backed by well-trained citizens can be deployed to war on short notice, which is the least costly plan for national defense security. Marshall himself, while serving as Chief of Staff, repeatedly stated that the United States must be prepared in peacetime, including universal military training.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th] The U.S. Congressional Joint Budget Committee today reduced the $37.5 billion budget for the 1948 fiscal year proposed by Truman by $6 billion. The committee's proposal must still be submitted to the full committee of 102 members for a final decision. The committee reduced Truman's estimated $11.2 billion military budget by $1.75 billion, which was criticized by Congressman Gnaegi, Chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, who considered this to endanger national security.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] President Truman's proposed budget of approximately $37.5 billion for this year was voted down by $6 billion today by the budget committees of both houses. Whether such budget cuts would harm national defense caused fierce debate before the vote. The budget reduction prompted an urgent protest from Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower, who opposed cutting military spending. It is said that Eisenhower believes that if military spending is reduced, it will greatly impact the national defense plan, such as closing some military camps and stopping large-scale activities of the Army Corps of Engineers.</p>
<h3>Discussion of German Peace Treaty Procedures: Soviet Representative Changes Position, Hints at Allowing Small Countries to State Opinions; U.S. and Soviet Union Engage in Heated Debate on Austrian Issue</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 11th] Soviet Representative Gusev recently hinted that the Soviet Union will abandon its completely opposed strategy regarding the participation of small countries in the German peace talks and informed the representatives of the foreign ministers of various countries that he will propose a special meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers within days to conduct consultations. The committee, under the order of the foreign ministers of various countries, will maintain frequent contact with the governments of small allied countries and serve as a liaison organization for conveying the resolutions of the great powers and the treaty proposals of the allied countries. Since Gusev has always firmly rejected the right of small countries to speak, today's statement is likely the first move to allow small countries to express their opinions.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 11th] At this morning's meeting of the four foreign ministers to discuss the draft peace treaty with Austria, chaired by British representative Hoot and attended by U.S. representative General Clark, the former commander of U.S. forces in Austria, and Soviet representative Gusev, a verbal dispute arose over the issue of eliminating German forces in Austria. First, General Clark opposed inserting a clause into the Austrian peace treaty stipulating that the Austrian government must provide a promise to prohibit all Pan-German propaganda in Austria. General Clark declared that we should impose certain obligations on the Austrian government to prevent it from merging with Germany economically or politically, and I deeply agree with this. However, I believe that the suggestion made by the Soviet Union may lead to interference in Austria's internal affairs. At this point, Soviet representative Gusev immediately stood up and strongly protested against this accusation. General Clark then compared the great freedom enjoyed by the American people with the small freedom allowed to their people by the Soviet Union. Soviet representative Gusev immediately stood up and stated that the four foreign ministers should maintain a faithful attitude towards each other's countries when discussing various issues. Chairman Hoot, seeing that the debate between the U.S. and Soviet representatives was quite heated, stood up and declared that the two representatives had gone too far and proposed that the Austrian issue be temporarily postponed for discussion in order to calm the situation. Finally, the meeting of the four foreign ministers decided to listen to the opinions of the representatives of Yugoslavia and Austria on the 14th of this month. At that time, the representatives of the two countries will clarify their opinions on Austria and answer questions from the British representative. The Austrian border issue is scheduled to be discussed on the 15th.</p>
<h3>Rumors of the Italian Fleet Being Intentionally Sunk</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 12th] Rome newspapers today published alarming news that a portion of the Italian fleet designated for transfer to the Allied countries will be sunk. The fleet is currently concentrated in Taranto. This rumor has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<h3>Palestine Conference Declared a Complete Failure</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 12th (Broadcast): The British-Arab Palestine talks have completely failed.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 12th (Broadcast): British officials revealed that after spokespersons from both the Arab and Jewish sides rejected the latest British proposal to resolve the Palestine dispute, the British government may consider submitting the entire Palestine issue to the United Nations for handling.</p>
<h3>Five Countries Express Discontent After European Peace Treaty is Signed; Italian Foreign Minister Sends Letter to Allied Governments, Declaring Reservation of the Right to Amend the Treaty</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 12th] Five signatory countries to the peace treaty today submitted letters of complaint regarding the terms of the treaty to French Foreign Minister Bidault, requesting that they be conveyed to all signatory countries. Three of these countries are former Axis satellite states, namely Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania, and the other two are Allied countries, namely Greece and Yugoslavia. The protests of the three countries, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania, are largely consistent, particularly objecting to the economic provisions of the treaty. Hungary is also advocating for the Hungarian minority in the Czech Republic. Bulgaria stated that Bulgaria's participation in the Allied side in September 1944 has not been recognized, which is regrettable. At the same time, Bulgaria has not obtained the right to access the Aegean Sea. Although Bulgaria's reparations have been reduced from $115 million to $70 million, it still feels overburdened because Bulgaria has fallen into extreme poverty under Nazi occupation. Romania insists that the country will comply with the terms of the treaty, but hopes to negotiate directly with various countries to improve these conditions in order to avoid being overwhelmed. Yugoslavia is dissatisfied with the solution to the Trieste issue, saying that Yugoslavia does not want to give up its claims to Venice Giulia and Gorizia. Greece said that although the Bulgarian border has been expanded, the Greek border has not been approved. The current Greek border cannot ensure security and feels threatened by the 55,000 standing army of Bulgaria allowed under the treaty. Observers here point out that the peace treaty has been met with a series of objections and discontent, not only from former enemy countries but also from Allied countries. It is clear that the Security Council will be filled with issues concerning the Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean in the future.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 11th] Italian Foreign Minister Sforza sent a letter to the Allied governments yesterday, stating that the Italian people acted under the oppression of a certain regime in the past. The Italian government did not participate in the discussions of this peace treaty. At the time of signing, we sincerely wish to prove the Italian government's willingness to boldly face the facts of tragedy and assistance to the establishment of the world's concrete peace. The first responsibility of the Italian government is to be absolutely loyal to the governments and peoples of all signatory countries because the treaty must rely on the moral support of the signatories to be implemented. The Italian people were the first nation to break away from the Axis and seek liberation on their own. Later, during the war, they provided direct or indirect benefits to the Allied countries, but reasonable consideration was not given to these merits. Although we acknowledge the various mistakes of the past, the Italian people have tried their best to atone for their actions until the time of signing. Today, as the Italian people and world citizens, we earnestly hope that there will be an opportunity to amend the shackles that are enough to poison the lives of 45 million people.</p>
<h3>Disarmament Issue Remains Deadlocked; U.S. and Soviet Representatives Engage in Verbal Battle with No Results</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 12th (Broadcast): In today's Security Council meeting, France and Britain fully supported the U.S. military reduction proposal, forming a united front to deal with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 12th] The issue of the disarmament procedure has been returned to the Security Council for handling. U.S. and Soviet representatives attacked each other again today, with neither side willing to budge. Austin and Gromyko both detailed their respective countries' positions to the Security Council, but neither made any suggestions on how to break the deadlock. The United States insists that all "weapons of mass destruction" should be handled by the Atomic Energy Commission, and all "conventional" weapons should be handled by the Disarmament Commission. The Soviet Union insists that the tasks of the two committees should not be separated. In a half-hour speech, Gromyko accused the United States of deliberately deviating from the main goal of disarmament and causing "procrastination" with its proposal. Austin said that the Soviet Union's rejection of the U.S. plan prevents the control of atomic energy from starting and strongly stated that the continued delay of the disarmament conference will "increase the risk of war." Gromyko concluded, "The United States wants to divide the tasks of the Atomic Energy Commission and the General Disarmament Commission, obviously wanting to shift our main goal to a purely organizational issue. Is this tactic useful?" The Security Council is scheduled to continue debating the conference procedure issue next Wednesday morning.</p>

<h3>Minimal Hope for a Successful Japanese Coalition Cabinet; Diet to Reconvene on the 14th</h3>
<p>[Reconstruction Society Tokyo, 12th] Japan's political situation remains extremely chaotic today, with little prospect of clarification in the coming days. The main figures in the third coalition effort, Finance Minister Ishibashi, Welfare Minister Kawai, and Socialist Party Secretary-General Nishio and Central Committee member Mizutani, will hold talks this evening to discuss the formation of a coalition cabinet. Prime Minister Yoshida, mindful of the previous two failures, is taking a cautious approach to the coalition issue. He will not announce the government's position until the conditions are ripe. Therefore, it has been decided that the Diet will reconvene on the scheduled 14th. He also intends to quickly decide on the Minister of Agriculture and the Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board. Today, he asked State Minister Shidehara to nominate a Minister of Agriculture from the Progressive Party. The Progressive Party, which initially actively promoted the coalition cabinet, is now wavering between coalition efforts and a new party movement. The Liberal Party has consistently taken a negative attitude towards the coalition effort. The Socialist Party believes that if the government and the Liberal Party maintain a negative attitude, the coalition effort will have little hope of success. With the date of the Diet's reconvening fast approaching, if a coalition cabinet is not formed, the Yoshida cabinet will have no choice but to force its weak body into the Diet. Finance Minister Ishibashi stated after meeting with Yoshida and Shidehara today: "To obtain aid from the United Nations, domestic political struggles must cease. A coalition cabinet may be formed. The terms of the coalition have also been largely communicated to the Socialist Party, but the Finance Minister must remain in office."</p>

<h3>Churchill's Daughter's Wedding Highlights: A Wonderful Interlude Amidst Britain's Energy-Saving Measures</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 12th] The wedding of Miss Mary Churchill yesterday was a major event in London in recent years. The area outside St. Margaret's Church, Westminster Abbey, was packed with people, making it extremely difficult for the bride and Churchill to make their way through the crowd. Most of the wedding took place in darkness, as it coincided with a power outage in the afternoon, which was unavoidable. However, as a special consideration, the authorities restored the power as the wedding was coming to an end, so the organ played the "Wedding March" as the newlyweds emerged from the church. The groom is Captain Soames, the dashing military attaché at the British Embassy in France. The bride was her father's private secretary, and is both talented and beautiful. As the wedding took place, the bell of the London clock tower chimed three times. As the bride emerged from the church, her face was radiant, and Churchill looked even more energetic. Lady Churchill also looked pleased. Churchill is widely admired outside of the political arena, so the crowd cheered incessantly, and some even broke through the police cordon to catch a glimpse of the old man. After the wedding, a reception was held at the Dorchester Hotel, with guests filling the seats, which was contrary to what the bride had originally hoped for. Miss Churchill had previously expressed a desire to simply entertain guests in a country villa. The newlyweds had originally planned to travel to Switzerland for their honeymoon, but due to transportation difficulties, they changed their plans and will depart tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Micronesia: A Key Military Location in the Pacific (Part 1) - Our Newspaper's Research Department</h3>
<p>In the vast and expansive Pacific Ocean, numerous islands, both large and small, are scattered throughout. Three groups of small islands within Micronesia—the Marshall Islands, the Mariana Islands, and the Caroline Islands—require a redefinition of their governance. This is a crucial issue in the peace treaty with Japan and is greatly related to the future security of the Pacific.</p>
<p>Underground Situation Overview</p>
<p>The three groups of small islands within the Micronesia area consist of over six hundred islands and one thousand four hundred reef islands, stretching thirteen hundred nautical miles from north to south and over two thousand seven hundred nautical miles from east to west, naturally forming a maritime Great Wall. The Mariana Islands are located in the far north, the Caroline Islands are in the southwest, and the Marshall Islands are slightly to the southeast, forming a tiered shape. Although they only have a total area of over two thousand square kilometers, their importance in the Pacific Ocean cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p>These three island groups are mostly composed of volcanic islands, coral islands, or coral reefs, and they are very small. The largest is Ponape Island in the Caroline Islands, covering three hundred and seventy-six square kilometers. Saipan Island in the Mariana Islands has the best economic conditions, with an area of one hundred and eighty-four square kilometers. The islands are all located in the tropics, with an average temperature of eighty-six degrees Fahrenheit and abundant rainfall. In terms of geographical environment, they are quite suitable for cultivation, but the area is too small, there is a lack of alluvial soil, and water sources are scarce, which greatly reduces their economic value. After the First World War, the Japanese gained control of them and devoted themselves to their development, exporting sugar, alcohol, phosphate, dried coconut, and dried fish in considerable quantities. The military value of the Micronesian Islands far exceeds their economic value. Taking Guam as the center (Guam can be said to be one of the Mariana Islands, but it is under American control, so it is not included in the scope of this article), Tokyo to the north, Wake Island to the east, and the Philippines to the west are all over one thousand five hundred nautical miles away, and Australia to the south is only over two thousand nautical miles away. They are located between the three continents of Asia, America, and Australia, along the major shipping routes of the world, serving as a bridge between the three continents. However, they can also cut off traffic between the three continents. In the past, when under Japanese rule, they were used as an outpost for invading Southeast Asia, allowing them to attack Australia and the Dutch East Indies, block the main route between America and the Philippines, and defend their homeland. As the focus of international conflict shifted to the Pacific, all countries recognized these three island groups as strategic strongholds. Whoever fails to gain control of them will be threatened.</p>

<h3>Mayor Convenes Emergency Meeting of All Industries to Work Together to Overcome Difficulties, Resist Mad Price Hikes, Orders Police Bureau to Strictly Prohibit the Transportation and Sale of Rice and Sugar to Suburbs; Overall Financial Policy to Be Resolved in Short Term</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] With gold notes soaring in recent days, affecting soaring prices, Mayor Wu, concerned about the people's livelihood, specially convened an emergency meeting of the industry associations related to daily necessities yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM to discuss ways to curb the price hikes. Attending were the Mayor, Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Li Jianhua, Director Gu Bingyuan, Deputy Speaker of the Municipal Council Xu, Jin Qixian of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Gao Jieshen, Luo Qinghua, Li Rentzai of the Bankers Association, Wu Yunfu of the Industrial Association, Wan Molin of the Rice Merchants Association, Jiufeng of the Cotton Cloth Merchants Association, Zhang Chao of the Rapeseed Oil Association, and representatives from over a hundred units in the money exchange, pastry, hot water, pig, fresh meat, north-south goods, tofu, fresh fish, vegetable, rice trading, local goods, oil factory, machinery coal, sugar, and seafood industries.</p>
<p>Mayor Urges Not to Fuel the Flames</p>
<p>The Mayor stated first: "The main purpose of convening this meeting is to hope that daily necessities will not follow the soaring of gold notes and fuel the flames, creating an intolerable situation. This time, prices have risen along with gold, and gold has risen along with US dollars. The reason for the rise in US dollars is that money exchanges refuse to accept old US banknotes and demand new US banknotes. Recently, they have even restricted the acceptance of new US banknotes with serial numbers, causing the US dollar to skyrocket and affecting prices. Now, the first thing that needs to be demanded of money exchanges is to order them not to differentiate between old and new US banknotes when buying and selling US dollars, and to cancel the 'serial number' requirement. If similar situations occur again, the municipal government will arrest those responsible. The rampant black market for rice is especially unreasonable. The municipal government now distributes 10,000 piculs of Saigon rice every day, which is enough for the daily consumption of Shanghai citizens, but rice merchants are still refusing to sell and hoarding rice. Yesterday, the municipal government discovered a rice merchant hoarding 500 piculs of rice and had him arrested by the Inspection Department of the Garrison Command. In the future, we will strictly prohibit the transportation and sale of rice to the suburbs. We have now ordered the police bureau to pay close attention at all times. If any violations are found, in addition to confiscating the rice, severe penalties will be imposed without leniency. As for the slow delivery of rice distributed by the municipal government, I can improve on that. There are currently 200 rice boats in the Suzhou River that are refusing to sell, but I believe they will not be able to get away if they insist on not selling."</p>
<p>"In short, I hope that all industry associations will assist the government and work together to overcome the difficulties. The central authorities will have a solution for the overall financial policy in the shortest possible time." The Mayor said at this point, repeatedly saying: "Everyone, please help. Otherwise, if I have to deal with a few of you, it would be too uninteresting!" Finally, the Mayor also hoped that everyone would not have their minds full of gold. If everyone compares everything to gold, then nothing will be easy to handle.</p>
<p>Showing Conscience, Pork Prices Have Not Increased</p>
<p>Afterwards, the Mayor asked about the difficulties of each industry, such as flour, edible oil, cotton cloth, coal briquettes, sugar, and pork, and refuted the inappropriateness of their price increases, and called on the industry associations to show conscience. At yesterday's meeting, only the fresh meat industry was in the limelight. The representative of the Fresh Meat Industry Association said: "While others are raising prices, we are the only ones lowering prices. Yesterday, pork fell to 4,400 yuan!" The Mayor, upon hearing this, quickly clasped his hands and said: "Enthusiastic about public welfare, excellent! Excellent!" The entire room responded with enthusiastic applause.</p>
<p>If the Government Collapses, the World Will Be in Great Chaos</p>
<p>Xu Jiying then stated that in the current unprecedentedly chaotic and panic-stricken situation, the government must control daily necessities, implement rationing, and encourage citizens to report those who hoard goods for speculation and raise prices as much as possible.</p>
<p>Luo Qinghua then expressed extreme indignation at the current situation in Shanghai, saying that the current price hike has exceeded all possible rationality and can only be described as madness! He said: "Although gold and US dollars have risen sharply, the exchange rate has not changed, so there should never have been this bad result. All industry associations must not forget the tragic situation when they asked the government for relief last year. If you willingly allow yourselves to be swept into the price hike by gold, you will be heading for decline. Ask yourselves, in today's Shanghai, who still has purchasing power? With interest rates so high, which company still has the ability to hoard goods? If all industries do not wake up, and prices increase by two times in three days, then in two weeks, the economy will collapse, the government will collapse, and the world will be in great chaos? And where will we be?"</p>
<p>To Suppress Prices, We Must Control Materials</p>
<p>Luo also asked the Mayor to convey to the government and urge the government to quickly decide on emergency measures and establish a gold policy. Luo believed that the government only had two options: (1) Sell generously. No matter how much you want, I will ration it, and in three days, the price of gold will immediately be suppressed. If the government is really suffering from inflation, then it should immediately restore the situation before June 4, 1945, when gold was not allowed to be bought or sold at all. At that time, no one would have thought that even soybean sprouts would follow the price of gold. Therefore, if the government gradually nationalizes gold, everything can be put back on track. (2) Close the gold market, so that gold cannot circulate freely, and its price will undoubtedly fall.</p>
<p>Luo finally expressed great emotion about the current situation in China, saying that after the excessive emphasis on freedom and democracy, the economic situation is very pessimistic. In fact, in this turbulent situation, everything can be bought by the government and then rationed according to rules. There is no need to be afraid of wearing the fascist hat. He also said: "Meetings are useless for suppressing prices. Today, to suppress prices, we must control materials!"</p>

<p>Wusong District Chief Wu Renqi</p>
<h3>Wu Yunfu, Not Afraid of Criticism, Advocates No Price Increase Movement</h3>
<p>Recently, prices have been rising in a straight line. Wu Yunfu of the Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory has initiated and advocated a "No Price Increase" movement, calling on the city's industrial and commercial sectors to respond, believing that with the nest overturned, no egg will be left intact, and demanding that they work together to save the current crisis. During the war, Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate's production was low, and it was one of the targets of hoarders. Recently, it has been able to produce about 20 million yuan worth of products per day. Wu has decided to continue to supply city users at the usual production volume and price. The factory's starch products will also continue to be supplied to direct users as much as possible without increasing the price. However, although Wu is making painstaking efforts and sacrificing himself, whether there will be anyone to follow him, or whether there will still be scalpers snapping up goods at that time, will depend on whether Shanghai merchants still have a conscience.</p>

<h3>Meeting of the Council's Health Committee</h3>
<p>Contagious Disease Hospital Should Not Be Moved Far</p>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Municipal Second Contagious Disease Hospital had previously petitioned the Council because the authorities were planning to move it to Baziqiao, which would be inconvenient due to the long distance and transportation. The Council's Health Committee held a temporary meeting yesterday afternoon, attended by Zhao Junhao, Chen Cunren, Wu Zhenghuo, and others. Regarding this case, it was resolved that, for the sake of the patients' time and finances, the Health Bureau should cancel the relocation. In addition, a proposal was made to request the municipal government to extend the deadline for clearing accumulated coffins and to handle cremation cases with caution. It was resolved to submit it to the Council for discussion.</p>
<h3>Full Account of Gold Sales to Be Thoroughly Investigated by H.H. Kung</h3>
<p>After the surge in gold prices, there has been much discussion, and some have used this to attack H.H. Kung. Yesterday, at the standing council meeting of the Central Bank, Kung, in his capacity as a standing director, specially proposed that a thorough investigation be conducted into the accounts of the entire gold sales case and the names of the purchasing firms in order to clarify the situation. The original proposal stated: "The sale of gold by this bank was originally intended to regulate finance, control currency, stabilize prices, and stabilize the market. Over the years, it has been quite effective. Recently, rumors have spread, gold prices have fluctuated sharply, and people are panicking, which has had a significant impact on society. The cause is that traitors spread rumors to speculate. In recent days, small newspapers have been clamoring, becoming more and more intense. Discussions in the streets and alleys point to the fact that the gold previously sold by this bank was all purchased by speculators, implying that the heads of this bank colluded in the process and had ulterior motives, and even involving individuals, trying to disrupt the political situation. The impact extends to personal reputation, which is a minor matter, but the government's credibility is a major concern, and rising prices and social stability are even more concerning. It is requested that the Operations Department, together with the Audit and Accounting Departments, conduct a thorough investigation of the accounts of the entire gold sales case and the names of the purchasing firms, and submit them for publication in order to clarify the situation and maintain the credibility of the national bank. As for the part involving Kung personally, I am certain that I have never purchased any, and neither have the relevant departments. However, fearing that traitors may borrow my name, I request that this be thoroughly investigated to clarify the truth." It is reported that the case has been passed by the Central Bank's council.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) International Routes to Resume Tomorrow; CNAC Passenger Plane to Fly to Hong Kong Today</h3>

<p>The Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC) Shanghai-Hong Kong flight is scheduled to officially resume this morning. More than thirty tickets were sold yesterday.</p>
<h3>Industrial Association Submits Five Opinions, Requests Reduction and Exemption of Profit Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial Association, in view of the many difficulties faced by the city's industry, which cannot bear the heavy tax burden, recently convened the ninth joint meeting of the first session of directors and supervisors and resolved to submit five opinions on the profit tax for the 35th year of the Republic. The content of the opinions is as follows: (1) Request the cancellation of the special excessive profit tax. (2) The amount of capital should be calculated according to the price index published by the authorities at the end of the tax year. (3) The starting point for taxation should be raised according to the price index. (4) Request the government to apply the measures for adjusting the value of fixed assets in the revaluation of industrial and mining enterprises to the production value of the 35th year of the Republic. The current assets should be calculated using the average price index of the tax year. (5) All factories established before the 26th year of the Republic that have suffered losses in the war and have not received compensation should be exempt from profit tax for a period of five years after being approved by the government. During the exemption period, shareholders and employees shall not distribute official dividends, so as to restore production capacity. These five opinions have been submitted to the government by the association yesterday, requesting their adoption in order to reduce the burden and revive the difficulties of industry.</p>
<h3>Renewed Hearing of the Grain Loan Case: Grain Merchants Claim Ignorance of Review and Payment Fees; Ren Xingyai Claims to Have Submitted Important Confidential Report</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the District Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution in the Grain Loan Case, the Criminal Court of the District Court initially opened the trial on December 18th of last year. Yesterday morning at 9:30, the collegiate bench reopened the trial. The four defendants released on bail, Wan Molin, Yang Runyu, and Ren Xingyai, all reported on time. The defendants in custody, Wang Daren, Wu Rongsheng, Wang Xunzhi, and Zhuang Hanzhang, were also brought in. Twelve rice merchants who had received grain loans, Zhu Yongming, Gu Mengsheng, Feng Yongsheng, Wang Yuzhen, Yu Liangji, Zhang Chao, Lu Lin, Chuan Changyu, Zhu Shilu, Xu Qinyuan, Xing Songwen, and Shao Jigao, were summoned to court to testify, with the exception of Shao Jigao. The eleven defense lawyers for the defendants, including Wu Zhengzhang, Yu Ting, and Wang Shanxiang, also appeared in court in full. Although the courtroom was very crowded, the order was well maintained. After Judge Wu Xiangzu, along with associate judges Wu Ronglin and Huang Guangyu, and Prosecutor Wu Qihua took their seats, the eight defendants were summoned. After questioning their ages and native places, they stated: The first interrogation in this case has exceeded the legal time limit of fifteen days, and a renewed hearing should be conducted according to law. The prosecutor initiated the prosecution speech, stating briefly that the main points of the indictment have already been described and will not be repeated, but stated: If it is intended to change the prosecution bill, please the judge to handle it carefully. The judge then began to question each defendant individually in order.</p>
<p>The first defendant, Wang Xunzhi, testified: He was the Deputy General Manager of the Changjiang Company. The application for the grain loan was introduced by Wan Molin. The entire loan was received on April 15th and repaid on May 15th, totaling 60 million yuan with a 3% interest rate. No review fee was paid in advance, nor was any remuneration paid afterward. The second defendant, Zhuang Hanzhang, testified: He only held a position as an employee in the Changjiang Company, and everything had to be done according to orders. He had no authority to advise on the purchase of rice grains or how to sell them. He had no knowledge of whether any review fees were paid.</p>
<p>**Wang Daren Notified to Stop Selling Public Rice**</p>
<p>The third defendant, Wu Rongsheng, was the manager of San Tai Grain and Miscellaneous Goods Store. In addition to handling grain loans, he also sold public rice on behalf of the Grain Administration Office. Originally, it was planned to sell 30,000 shi (a unit of dry measure), and an agreement was made with the Grain Administration Office to sell 5,000 bags per period of ten days. However, after selling 4,530 bags in the period from May 15th to May 25th, Wang Daren ordered the sales to be stopped. However, he stated: This order to stop sales was not given in writing, but only verbally by Wang Daren. The fourth defendant, Wan Molin, 46 years old, a local resident, is currently the Chairman of the Bean and Rice Industry Association. He did not appear in court at the last hearing because he was attending the National Assembly in Beijing. It is said that Wan Changxin and Wan Changjun were both founded by him, and Yang Runyu is the manager of both places. A total of 415 shi of grain loan rice was handled, and for the sake of convenience, it was all sold to Wan Changhao by Wan Changxin for distribution. He had not heard of any corrupt practices in the grain loan. The fifth defendant, Xing Zhigang, is the manager of Shun Feng Company. He stated: When he applied for the loan, it was already at its limit. Later, Wan Molin agreed to transfer the loan under the name of Wan Changxin to him for handling. He knew nothing else. The sixth defendant, Yang Runhui, stated that he was the manager of Wan Changxin and that the grain loan funds were transferred from Wan Molin to Xing Zhigang. The reason for the transfer was unknown. He also stated that there are three institutions with the Wan brand: Wan Chang Factory specializes in rice milling, Wan Changxin specializes in wholesale, and Wan Changhao sells retail. The three places have their own separate accounts, and their economies are also independent.</p>
<p>**Only Official Interest of 3% Was Charged, No Other Fees Collected**</p>
<p>The seventh defendant, Wang Daren, stated: The grain loan was organized in response to local requests and approved by the government. Because the Grain Administration Office had not been established for long, it lacked reference materials on various grain companies and had difficulty reviewing them. Therefore, the initial trial implementation adopted a recommendation method. In addition to the official interest of 3%, no other fees were charged for the grain loan. The court asked about the fact that it was originally planned to sell 30,000 shi of public rice, but only 5,000 shi were sold before it was stopped. Wang replied that the then Minister of Grain, Xu, said that military grain was in short supply and could not be sold in its entirety. Later, because the rice sold was brown rice, which did not meet the needs of the city, the sales were stopped after receiving orders from Minister Xu. At this point, the court took out a letter from Minister Xu to the Garrison Headquarters for the defendant to read, which stated that the Ministry did not know about the stopping of sales after selling 5,000 shi, and the Grain Administration had not reported it either. Wang still pleaded that it was due to the need for military grain at the time.</p>
<p>The eighth defendant, Ren Xingyai, stated: None of the seventeen grain loan merchants were introduced by him, and he resigned on May 8th. At that time, the grain loan had not yet ended. He had no corruption whatsoever. If the court finds evidence of corruption, he can be shot immediately. He also stated that the reports at the time that he was Ren Yuandao's nephew and that he had fled in fear of punishment were all baseless rumors, and he was very angry about them. Therefore, he submitted a long confidential letter to Minister Xu in Beijing, in which the accusations were all true. At this point, the court nodded in agreement and ordered him to leave.</p>
<p>**Further Hearing Postponed Due to Unarrived Witnesses**</p>
<p>Subsequently, the people summoned, all claimed to be unaware of the "review fee" and had never paid it. Except for three families introduced by Li Chongnian, the rest were introduced by the Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Chamber of Commerce. The judge immediately announced: Because witness Shao Jigao Zhu has not yet arrived, the case will be re-tried at a later date. The defendants Wang Xunzhi, Zhuang Hanzhang, Wu Rongsheng, and Wang Daren are remanded in custody. The defendants Wan Molin, Yang Runyu, Xing Zhigang, and Ren Xingyai remain on their original bail. The applications for bail for the four defendants in custody were all rejected, and the rest were dismissed.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Guarantees Aircraft Personnel; No Criminal Liability for Accidents Due to Sudden Changes</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Chen Wenkuan and Wu Shi, the heads of the flight divisions of Central Air Transport Corporation and China National Aviation Corporation, submitted their resignations to their respective companies after receiving warnings from the District Prosecutor's Office that they would be held responsible for negligent homicide in the event of an aircraft accident. After being retained by the company authorities, they petitioned the Ministry of Communications for guarantees. It is now learned that the Ministry of Communications has sent a telegram back yesterday approving the record. After three passenger planes crashed in Shanghai airspace last Christmas, the District Prosecutor's Office investigated the results and issued a non-prosecution disposition to Chen Wenkuan, Deputy Director of the Flight Division of Central Air Transport Corporation, He Shourong, and Wu Shi, Director of the Flight Division of China National Aviation Corporation, and Deputy Director Chen Hongen Wang, stating: "Upon investigation, the flight division personnel of the two companies did not pay sufficient attention to safety in the command of the planes on December 25, 1946, when three passenger planes crashed in Shanghai in succession, and there was negligence. According to the Criminal Law, the most severe penalty for negligent homicide in the course of business is less than five years. Because it meets the requirements of the Amnesty Ordinance, it is not prosecuted."</p>
<p>**Resignations Submitted After Receiving Warning**</p>
<p>After receiving this warning, Chen and others believed that while the issue of responsibility was certainly the responsibility of the flight division supervisors, accidents were caused by sudden changes in weather or mechanical failures that could not be prevented by human effort, and they were also impossible to prevent. Therefore, the flight division could not salvage or prevent the occurrence of incidents. However, the local court indicted them on suspicion of negligent homicide in the course of business. Fortunately, they were granted amnesty, otherwise they would have been sentenced to several years of imprisonment, which would have been unjust. Therefore, the company authorities submitted their resignations.</p>
<p>**Guarantee Proposed and Approved for Record**</p>
<p>The two companies believed that Chen and others had served for many years and that talent was valuable at a time when civil aviation urgently needed to develop. Therefore, they tried to retain them and reported to the Ministry of Communications suggesting that if there were any aircraft accidents in the future, the true cause of the accident should be used to determine who was responsible, and the assessment should be fair and impartial, so as to ensure that no one was wrongly accused or let off. If it is due to a sudden change in the climate, in a situation where personnel have done their best and human effort is difficult to apply, the specialized responsible personnel should be guaranteed to remove their fear and be able to work with peace of mind." After this request was sent to the Ministry of Communications, the company authorities received a reply telegram from the Ministry of Communications yesterday, which stated briefly: In the future, before any aircraft takes off, it should be subject to a detailed and thorough inspection by the flight division personnel to ensure safety, and the inspectors should sign and be responsible. As for the point that the responsible personnel should be guaranteed in the event of an accident due to other sudden changes in circumstances beyond human control, it is approved for record. The company has now forwarded this reply to the flight division, and the resignation intentions of Chen and others are expected to be rescinded.</p>
<h3>Thieves Dressed Like Rich Young Masters and Ladies; Six Criminals Escorted from Beijing to Shanghai; Fifty Boxes of Stolen Goods Recovered</h3>
<p>The "Four Famous Mountains" pickpocketing gang had already seen three members, Liu Hangxia, Liu Huaide, and Zhang Zhiqing, captured by the Railway Bureau Police Department. The remaining members, Wu Tiancai, Zhang Xianglin (also known as Yunpeng), Li Jingping, Zhang Xiaomei, Xiao Jinbao, and Wu Dongying, have been captured in Beijing. Yesterday, they were escorted from Beijing to Shanghai. It is reported that on the 8th, at about 10 pm, on the eleventh night express train from Beijing to Shanghai, a passenger named Qu Xinglin suddenly discovered that a box had been switched. He reported it to the railway police, who carried out an inspection. Finally, the thief Wu Tiancai was found in the same car, and the stolen goods were confiscated. When escorted to the police section for interrogation, he confessed to his accomplices Zhang Yungui, Zhu Shaoxiong, Zhang Xianglin, Li Jingping, Zhang Xiaomei, Xiao Jinbao, and Wu Dongying, who were hiding in the Anle Hotel in Xiaguan, Nanjing. They went to the address and arrested Zhang Xianglin, Li Jingping (Da Luo's wife), Zhang Xiaomei (Zhang Xianglin's wife), Xiao Jinbao (Zhang Ronggui's wife), and Wu Dongying (Zhu Shaorong, i.e., Xiao Luo's wife). Da Luo and Xiao Luo had already escaped after hearing the news in advance. Fifty boxes of stolen goods and dozens of pieces of gold jewelry were also confiscated on the spot.</p>
<p>According to Wu Tiancai, they arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on December 29th. Zhang Xianglin had just been released from prison after being pardoned. After arriving in Beijing, they committed more than a dozen cases, which are not easy to remember clearly. The largest case was on February 1st, when they stole 4 million yuan from a passenger on the train, and 2.8 million yuan on February 3rd. They have committed more than a hundred cases in Shanghai, and they have been arrested several times, but they have all been recently released after being pardoned. The criminals are well-dressed. The female criminals are all wearing brocade cheongsams, brand-new sea otter velvet coats, and high-top black leather shoes, looking like noble ladies. The male criminals are wearing suits and leather shoes, looking like young masters. It is absolutely impossible to tell from their appearance that they are thieves. It is also reported that these six male and female criminals will be transferred to the District Court by the Police Department this afternoon for handling.</p>

In the end, he escaped without a trace. When the bullets cracked, the Zhabei Branch Bureau was close at hand. Upon hearing the gunfire, a large number of police officers were dispatched. After clarification, they returned to the bureau.</p>

<h3>Dispute Over Silver Shop Transaction; Indiscriminate Ringing of Police Bell Rebuked</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Sun Zhiliang, a martial arts actor from the Gong Wu Stage on Zhongzheng Central Road, had only two gold rings weighing three mace and six fen (a unit of weight) at his home at about 3:50 pm yesterday because he lacked cash for expenses. When he was about to go out to exchange them, two martial arts actor colleagues, Guo Qingpeng and Wang Yongchun, arrived, so they went together to Yongfeng Silver Shop at No. 507 Zhongzheng Central Road to exchange them. After the silver shop owner, Ma Wenming, weighed them, they weighed only three mace and four fen. According to the silver shop's listed purchase price of 700,000 yuan per tael, he should have received 238,000 yuan. However, Ma was only willing to pay 210,000 yuan. The three martial arts actors argued with reason, but Ma rang the police bell several times. The Taishan Police Bureau heard the alarm and immediately ordered a large number of people to rush to the scene, blocking all the intersections around. Part of the officers bravely rushed in and learned that it was not a robbery, but a business dispute. The police officers believed that the owner should not regard the police bell as a child's plaything, so they took him to the bureau for rebuke as a warning to others.</p>
<h3>Police Officer Shoots Colleague</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Yingcheng, a 24-year-old Chaozhou native and an employee of the Police Bureau's Firearms Section, residing at No. 1, Lane 58, Yunnan South Road, was passing through the Eight Immortals Bridge in plain clothes at 6 pm last night when he saw a pedicab driver being pulled over by police officer No. 3528. A dispute arose, so he stepped forward to inquire. He learned that the pedicab driver's truck did not have a license, but according to police regulations, he must be taken to the bureau for disposal. However, the police officer took the pedicab driver to the truck owner's place at No. 64, Jiuan Lane, Da Lai South Goods Store, Great World. Zhang believed that the police officer was suspected of dereliction of duty, so after the police officer came out of the store, he questioned him. The police officer was unwilling to show weakness and retorted, claiming that he went to the store at the pedicab driver's request because the pedicab driver wanted to report to the store owner in advance. Zhang still did not believe him, so a conflict arose. Unexpectedly, at the entrance of Hongyun Lane, Ninghai West Road, the police officer suddenly pulled out his official pistol and fired two shots at Zhang without asking the reason. The bullets hit his head and waist, and he fell to the ground and died on the spot. After causing the incident, the police officer knew that it would be difficult to escape the law, so he immediately raised his gun and fired a shot at his own chest, attempting to commit suicide. However, because he was too nervous at the time, he missed. At that time, nearby residents heard the gunfire and fled in panic. The police officer took the opportunity to escape without a trace. Afterwards, the Songshan Road Police Branch Bureau, which was in charge of the area, received the report and immediately dispatched a large number of police officers to rush to the scene of the incident to conduct a detailed investigation, and sent the deceased to the autopsy institute. As of late at night, the police officer who committed the crime had not yet been arrested, but his wife had been detained. At the same time, Gao Aisheng (34 years old, from Pudong), the truck driver of Da Lai South Goods Store, was also summoned to testify.</p>

<h3>Embezzlement Case of Materials Worth 60 Billion; Sun Qinchi and Three Others Indicted for Suspicion of Corruption; Zhou Fushan and Four Others Suspected of Theft; Not Prosecuted Because They Meet the Amnesty Requirements</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In the embezzlement case of materials worth 60 billion yuan from the Municipal Government's reception of Yanping Road materials, Shen Zhenjia, Sun Qinchi, and Shen Wenyuan, former senior officials of the Municipal Government, were investigated and concluded by Prosecutor Hong Biao of the District Prosecutor's Office, who believed that there was indeed a suspicion of corruption, and a public prosecution was filed yesterday. Although Zhou Fushan, Zhou Yunshan, Zhang Jingyao, and Chen Rongjian of the Fuki Construction Factory were also suspected of theft, their crimes were committed before December 31, 1946. Even if the crimes were true, they were also covered by the amnesty, so they were not prosecuted.</p>
<p>**Full Text of Indictment**</p>
<p>Shen Wenyuan, male, 30 years old, from Qingpu, currently works for an art company, residing at No. 1, Lane 59, Xujiahui Station Street. Shen Zhenjia, male, 37 years old, from Yuyao, currently works as a businessman, residing at No. 415, Changchun Road. Sun Qinchi, also known as Qinru, male, 50 years old, from Hangzhou, residing at No. 1, 1st Floor, Changchun Apartment, North Sichuan Road.</p>
<p>The above-named defendants are suspected of corruption. The investigation has been concluded that a prosecution should be filed. The facts of the crime, evidence, and legal provisions are listed as follows: When Shen Wenyuan was assigned to the reception staff of the Municipal Government after the victory, he was appointed as a clerk in the Motor Vehicle Section of the General Affairs Office of the Shanghai Municipal Government. Shen Zhenjia was the director of the Motor Vehicle Section of the General Affairs Office. Sun Qinchi was the director of the General Affairs Office. Taking advantage of the fact that the enemy and the Japanese had just surrendered in Shanghai and all reception matters were not yet in order, the Municipal Government lacked cars and gasoline in September 1945. Mei Nisiping's chauffeur, Pan Zhongren, was ordered to be detained and interrogated. It was clear that the enemy and the Japanese were operating the Idemitsu Company (the abbreviation of Japanese-owned China Idemitsu Kosan Co., Ltd.). The defendant, Shen Wenyuan, was instructed to investigate, accompanied by Pan Zhongren. He dragged back many cars from the Jianghai Road warehouse. Shen Wenyuan learned that Idemitsu Company had a large amount of stored oil elsewhere, stored in various places in the city, and reported to the office. After receiving the report, the defendant Shen Zhenjia only consulted with the defendant Sun Qinchi once. He did not report it to the mayor for approval, nor did he care that there was another institution in Shanghai at the time, the Enemy and Puppet Private Industrial and Commercial Handling Committee. He took the reception into his own hands so that he could obtain illegal benefits. Therefore, he still sent Shen Wenyuan to contact Idemitsu Company. Yoshida, a Japanese employee of Idemitsu Company, copied a detailed list of the amount of stored oil in various places of the company and handed it to Shen Wenyuan to take back. The defendants concealed the list and did not report it. They went to the oil storage locations to carry out the reception. In addition to sending the defendant Shen Wenyuan, they also sent clerks Guo Dasheng, technician Chen Enfu, and Yang Guozhen to collect all the stored oil in the company's Kunming Road, Macau Road, Grantham Road, Tongjia Road, Yanping Road and other places. The amount of stored oil on Yanping Road was the largest. After the reception, they did not make a list. The defendant Shen Wenyuan added a blue paper sign with the official seal of the Municipal Government, "Shanghai Municipal Government Warehouse", in front of the original warehouse to cover up the goal, so that it could be taken and carried at will. After the stored oil in the Tongjia Road, Macau Road, and Grantham Road was received, they did not hesitate to spend engineering and transport costs to transport it to the Kunming Road oil depot for concentration, so that the numbers were confused and it would be difficult to investigate in the future. They also transferred police officers from the Yulin Road Branch to be stationed at the Kunming Road oil depot for guard. From September 21, 1945, the oil received at the place was gradually taken for use. In December 1945, Idemitsu Company sent four copies of the property directory to the place. In January 1946, the place sent clerk Ye Yaoqing to be stationed at the Kunming Road oil depot to be responsible for safekeeping to cover people's eyes and ears.

<h3>Handling Ship Collisions; Port Affairs Association Sets Interim Measures; Ship Captains Who Are Indeed Criminally Responsible Can Be Detained by the Court</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The 18th meeting of the Port Affairs Reorganization Committee was held in the Municipal Government Auditorium yesterday morning. Mayor Wu submitted for discussion the petitions of the Chinese Merchant Ship Drivers Association, the Chinese Nautical Drivers Association, and the Chinese Sailors Association, requesting a guarantee that the water police would no longer overstep their authority and detain the parties involved in ship collisions. It was decided to submit a request to the Ministry of Communications to transfer to the Ministry of Judicial Administration to formulate procedures for handling maritime cases in accordance with the Maritime Law. Before these handling procedures are formulated: interim measures for handling ship collisions are tentatively agreed upon: (1) After a ship collision occurs, the port police or water police should assist both captains in handling emergency measures, and both captains should submit a report to the Maritime Affairs Bureau. (2) After receiving the report, the Maritime Affairs Bureau should convene a ship collision dispute handling committee as soon as possible within 24 hours to determine the responsibility for the collision. (3) If the handling committee believes that the captain is indeed criminally responsible or the family of the victim files a lawsuit with the court and the prosecutor makes an accusation based on the responsibility listed in the handling document, the captain can be detained by the court. Otherwise, before the collision incident is completely handled, the shipping company to which he belongs should provide a guarantee to the Maritime Affairs Bureau. Regarding the re-determination of the passenger limit for ships, the Maritime Affairs Bureau convened the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Shipping Industry Association, and the aircraft to hold meetings for careful discussion. The proposal: (1) Long-distance ships will still be handled in accordance with the regulations. (2) Short-distance ships will be re-inspected by the Maritime Affairs Bureau, and the number of ships will be increased or decreased according to the actual situation. (3) Equip sufficient life-saving equipment according to the number of passengers carried. (4) Passengers are not allowed on the top of the ship. (5) The Customs House originally had two motor lifeboats set up in Wusong, and it is proposed to restore the setting and equip them with wireless electricity and first aid kits. The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau submitted the above proposal to the conference for discussion. Except for item (2), the conference resolved to pass it.</p>
<h3>Speaking Eloquently, Resembling a "Diplomat" – The Puppet Foreign Minister Wu Kaisheng's Trial Concluded Yesterday, Awaiting Judgment</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Wu Kaisheng, the puppet foreign minister, was tried at the High Court yesterday. He hails from Yixing, Jiangsu Province, is forty-eight years old, holds a doctorate in law from the University of Paris, France, and enjoyed a reputation in legal and diplomatic circles before the war. During the Anti-Japanese War, he stayed in Shanghai and, after joining the puppet organization, successively served as a reserve member of the puppet Central Supervisory Committee, a member of the Examination Committee of the puppet Examination Yuan, the puppet ambassador to Italy (never went abroad), the puppet foreign minister, and a member and secretary-general of the puppet Committee for the Abolition of Extraterritoriality. When he was brought out of the Zhongjian Prison yesterday morning, he wore a light gray silk-faced silk-cotton robe, had a fresh haircut, and had a plump face, with a volume of defense statements and documents under his arm. During his defense, he spoke eloquently, seemingly retaining the true colors of "a lawyer and a diplomat." The key points of the defendant's response to the indictment were: (1) During the period of the occupation, the environment in Shanghai was harsh, and intellectuals were especially subjected to oppression by the enemy and puppets. His assumption of puppet positions was not a willing act of allegiance to the enemy but was a matter of being forced into it. Later, he established close ties with the Military Statistics Bureau, providing cover for underground workers, and for the sake of work, he had to endure everything. (2) His position as a member of the Examination Committee of the puppet Examination Yuan was nominal, with no actual work. (3) As the puppet ambassador to Italy, he never went abroad to take office. (4) He rescued underground comrades, protected foreign clergy and churches, helped secretly set up radio stations, and transmitted intelligence, which was not without minor contributions. He pleaded with the court for a lenient sentence. Subsequently, the defendant's lawyer, Cai Xiaobai, stood up to defend him. Judge Liu announced the conclusion of the trial and set the sentencing for the morning of the 19th.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Fu Guangyao, who had been sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment, appealed to the Supreme Court due to dissatisfaction. After being remanded for retrial, the High Court concluded the retrial yesterday and also set the sentencing for the morning of the 19th.</p>
<h3>Prices of Everything Soar and Fluctuate Severely – Blue Cloth for Public School Teachers and Civil Servants, Eight Yards Per Person, Totaling 40,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Recently, commodity prices have fluctuated drastically. The eighth special allocation of first-class blue cloth for public school teachers and civil servants in this city will be distributed from the 13th to the 22nd of this month, with eight yards allocated per person. Each yard is priced at nearly 1,000 yuan, totaling 40,000 yuan. Five people will jointly receive one bolt. Compared to the market price of about 1,000 yuan per foot, those who wish to purchase it should still have their respective public school and civil service institutions compile and purchase it with famine-relief allocation tickets. It has also been learned that the deadline for the seventh-period allocation of canned meat is the 15th of this month, with the selling price remaining at 600 yuan per can, and eighteen cans per person, totaling 10,800 yuan. Purchases have been extremely enthusiastic in recent days.</p>
<h3>Hearing that Wen Lantin's Condition Has Not Improved After Surgery</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Wen Lantin, who is receiving medical treatment at the Red Cross Hospital, underwent his first surgery on the eve of the Lunar New Year's Eve. It was originally planned that after a short rest, he would undergo a second surgery to remove the malignant tumor. However, it has been more than twenty days, and Wen's condition has not shown significant improvement. He is still only consuming a small amount of juice and drifts into a drowsy sleep every day. As a result, many old friends and acquaintances visit him daily, and the signature book has already accumulated three volumes.</p>
<h3>A Puppet Official with Unkempt Hair and a Dirty Face – Stuttering and Relying on Treacherous Fame</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The High Court tried the case of Li Fowen, a suspected traitor, yesterday. Li is from Rehe, but because he grew up in Japan from a young age, he can only speak Japanese. When he appeared in court yesterday, he had unkempt hair and a dirty face, wore a tattered padded robe, and was covered with a tattered coat. He was shivering from the cold and suffered from a stutter. He was very strange when he answered questions, stuttering every time he opened his mouth. According to his statement, he originally served as the commander of a cavalry regiment in Outer Mongolia. In 1942, he came to Shanghai and was introduced to be an intelligence officer for the Third War Area Headquarters. He was captured by the Japanese Kempeitai (military police) and was only released after the victory. However, the certificate issued by the Third War Area Headquarters had been burned by the Japanese Kempeitai. Later, through the introduction of a doctor surnamed Jian, he met Liu Zhenming, the commander of the Huainan District Column of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Command. Liu appointed him as the colonel commander of the 4th Regiment of the column, with about 3,000 troops stationed in Bengbu, Anhui Province, and Gaoyou, Jiangsu Province. He was arrested before he could take office. He also claimed: "During the Anti-Japanese War, I was doing anti-Japanese work. After the victory, I was doing anti-communist work, not a traitor. As for the weapons manufacturing plan, it was drafted by a Japanese named Ikezaki. Because Liu Zhenming needed a weapons repair talent, I recommended Ikezaki. Liu Zhenming asked him to write a resume and plan, which Ikezaki wrote and put in my bag, and it was found during my arrest. The 300 million yuan in puppet currency for activities was borrowed from a wealthy tobacco merchant surnamed Xian, not provided by the Japanese." At this point, the court stated that the case still required investigation and ordered a postponement for retrial. When the defendant signed his name "Li Fowen," it was like a child learning to write, which was quite comical.</p>
<h3>Wang Youqing and Xiang Yushan Escorted to the High Court for Trial Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Wang Youqing (also known as Da Kun), a secret agent of the enemy's military police and the manager of the puppet Central Market Hejudi Goods Firm, and Xiang Yushan, a puppet Central Market administrator, have been prosecuted by the High Procuratorate after being reported by others. Yesterday, the two defendants were escorted to the High Court. After Judge Qiu questioned the defendants about their names, ages, hometowns, and addresses, he ordered them to be detained in the Shanghai Prison pending trial. Wang Youqing's attitude was quite stubborn, still not abandoning his rude nature.</p>
<h3>Xu Jiang Remained Silent Upon Hearing the Ten-Year Sentence</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Xu Jiang, who had served as the director of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau and the director of the Special Sericulture Construction Office of the puppet Ministry of Finance, had his trial concluded by the High Court on the 5th. Yesterday at 10:00 AM, the sentence was pronounced at the High Court. Judge Liu stood up and read out the main text of the verdict: "Xu Jiang, conspiring with foreign countries to plot against one's own country, is sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, deprived of civil rights for ten years, and his property is confiscated, except for what is necessary to provide for his family's living expenses." After Judge Liu finished reading, he continued: "If you are not satisfied with the sentence, you may apply to the Supreme Court for a retrial within ten days of receiving the judgment." After hearing the sentence, the defendant remained silent and was returned to the Zhongjian Prison.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The original Jiangsu Second Prison in Caohejing, Shanghai, was destroyed during the Anti-Japanese War and is now a field of rubble. The site occupies a total of 130 mu of land. The warden of the Shanghai Prison, Xu Chongwen, has obtained approval from Xie Guansheng, the Minister of Justice, to enclose the abandoned site with bamboo fences, naming it the Shanghai Prison Farm, and has appointed Zhong Shihu to be in charge of it.</p>
<h3>The Former French Barracks Refuse to Relinquish, Preventing the District Court from Moving In</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The municipal government authorities, based on a resolution of the Municipal Council, requested the buildings of the former French barracks at 73-75 Avenue Road (old Fuli Road) as the site for the District Court. After negotiations, the French Consulate stated that the above-mentioned buildings are French state property and refused to relinquish them. The Assets Clearance Committee of the former concession is currently consulting with them on the transfer. It is said that after the District Court relocates, the buildings it originally used will be entirely used by the High Court.</p>
<h3>Administrative Penalties for the Great Fire Case – Decided to Handle According to the Report – Zhou Zhaoxiang Given a Demerit, Zhuo Houdao Dismissed, Zhu Qinglan and Li Xun Dismissed but Retained</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The investigation committee has completed its investigation on the administrative aspect of the great fire case on Seymour Road and Wuding Road, and the chairman of the committee, Ge Kexin, has submitted the report to the mayor. The mayor has decided to follow the recommendations regarding the penalties. He also believes that Zhou Zhaoxiang, the director of the Fire Department, should also be given a major demerit. The full text of the report is divided into eight key points: it discusses improving the treatment of police officers, supplementing fire-fighting equipment, increasing funding, recruiting volunteer firefighters, and rectifying bad practices. Finally, when discussing the responsibility and penalties for the entire case, it believes that the factors leading to the Seymour Road fire were complex, involving political, economic, social, historical, and even psychological relationships. However, firefighters should not use this as an excuse to shirk their responsibility. Zhuo Houdao, the squad leader of the Yichang Road District where the police officers who stole property belonged, was ineffective in supervision and training and is proposed to be dismissed. Zhu Qinglan, the commander who arrived at the fire scene first, and Li Xun, the squad leader of the district under his jurisdiction, were negligent in supervision and are proposed to be dismissed but retained. Xia Guoliang, the commander of the fire brigade, was negligent in supervision and is proposed to be given a major demerit. Zhou Zhaoxiang, the director of the Fire Department, although not directly responsible for the fire-fighting on site, failed to do his best in management, assessment, and planning and is proposed to be reprimanded by order. Those involved in criminal cases will be dealt with after the court concludes its trial. Lin Zhenqiang and Xiao Zuosheng, patrol officers of the Jiangning Branch of the Police Bureau, were negligent in guarding and are proposed to be given a demerit each. It is hoped that all police officers will encourage each other from now on, work hard to revitalize, and society will have its own public opinion. It will not be difficult to restore honor and regain the trust of the citizens in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Zhang Naizuo Advocates – Fire-Fighting Organization – Government-Supervised and Privately-Run</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Zhang Naizuo, a member of the Seymour Road Fire Investigation Committee, stated in his capacity as the convener of the Municipal Council's Police Affairs Committee that after investigating the Seymour Road fire case, it was found that there were indeed inadequacies in fire-fighting. Although factors such as tight funding and rudimentary equipment were the main reasons, the imperfect fire-fighting management was an undeniable fact. When the investigation committee visited the Central District Fire Department, the department's 150-foot ladder truck could not be tested and deployed within twenty minutes, which showed its dereliction of duty. In addition, during the era of the former Municipal Council, the Fire Department could start the fire engine within 30 seconds of receiving an alarm. Now, according to the Fire Department itself, due to the incomplete equipment, it takes at least one minute at the fastest and up to five minutes at the slowest. And statistics show that there were 1,063 fires in this city last year, averaging three fires per day. If each delay is five minutes, how much property of the people must be lost? Therefore, I believe that the organization of fire-fighting must be improved. In addition to active measures such as widening road widths and demolishing irregular houses, which can be handled by the government's responsibility, other parts can adopt a government-supervised and privately-run approach. Simply restoring the volunteer firefighter police system of the former Municipal Council era is not enough to change the entire fire-fighting organization. As for the funding for the government-supervised and privately-run fire-fighting organization, I believe that the government should provide assistance, and the insurance industry association, which is directly related to fire-fighting, must also assume a part of it. In addition, the public can raise funds on their own. The detailed reorganization plan will be submitted for discussion when the next Municipal Council is convened.</p>

<h3>Brick Walls Obstruct Traffic – The Municipal Government Notified to Demolish Them</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The brick wall at the Youlong Wharf in Pudong was built by the Japanese invaders. It is ten inches thick, six feet high, and twenty-eight feet long, cutting across the road. It is now used as a surrounding wall by the Pudong Water Plant. This wall obstructs traffic and affects the business of boatmen. The boatmen jointly requested the Municipal Council to forward the request to the Municipal Government for demolition. According to the investigation by the Municipal Government, it is confirmed that it obstructs traffic, so the Bureau of Public Works has been ordered to be responsible for the demolition. In addition, the brick wall and iron gate at the Hengfeng Wharf on Huasheng Road in Hongkou belong to the Hengfeng Yarn Factory, but they are also obstacles to traffic. The Municipal Government has notified them to demolish them immediately.</p>

<h3>Indictment of the Embezzlement Case of Taking Over (Continued from Previous)</h3>
<p>The former site of the Mitsuura Company at 360 Yanping Road was originally the factory building of the Zhou Fook Kee Construction Factory, and 29 Tongjia Road was also a branch of the Zhou Fook Kee Factory. During the occupation, the company was hired to repair work and owed wages. Before the victory, the Japanese were afraid of Allied bombing, so they dispersed various oil and material resources and occupied the factory. The factory owner, Zhou Fushan, also known as Zhou Zhengfu, was afraid of the enemy's increasingly declining power. He always avoided asking or hearing about daily transactions, as it would easily arouse suspicion. The employees hired to watch the factory, Zhou Yunshan, Zhang Jingyao, Chen Rongjian, etc., saw that the defendants Shen Wenyuan, etc., took such measures and took the opportunity to steal. However, the amount of materials they stole, and the names and actual quantities of materials embezzled by the defendants Shen Wenyuan and Shen Zhenjia, etc., were known from the detailed list of oil stored in various locations copied by the Japanese Yoshida Tatsuhiko, which was always hidden in the hands of Shen Wenyuan. It is actually difficult to accurately determine the exact number. Therefore, based on the catalog of Mitsuura's property received by the Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau sent by the department, which was already in December 1945, more than three months had passed since the department took over without authorization. Although the catalog was created and sent by the Mitsuura Company, it omitted the oil stored at Yanping Road and added notes such as "leaking barrels," "empty barrels," and "empty boxes" in other received oil stores, indicating that this catalog was made by the defendants in collusion with the Japanese after the case occurred to cover up. Only the oil item was sealed by the Municipal Government, totaling 59,678 gallons. According to the amount published in the instructions of the investigation team of the processing bureau, there are a total of 67,390 gallons. Compared with the two, there are 7,712 gallons more of oil, equivalent to 154 large barrels and 12 gallons more. It can be determined that this amount of oil was concealed and underreported by the defendants. Moreover, after the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner's Office sent personnel to conduct an on-site investigation on March 11, 1946, it was found that six large jars of diesel oil that had been poured out were found in the empty area of Yanping Road, which were stolen by Zhou Yunshan, Zhang Jingyao, etc., and had not been taken away. The matter was first secretly reported to the Third Front Army by Zhang Zhenping, Chen Shaoting, Yu Xianglin, etc. On October 30, 1945, Lu Shishang, the leader of the Material Group of the former Military Supply Receiving Committee of the Third Front Army, sent team member Wang Zenglue to investigate with the reporters and copied out 624 barrels of kerosene and diesel oil (each barrel containing 50 gallons) and 200 bicycle inner and outer rubber tires, ceramic tiles, iron hooks, iron cables, and 30 cans of Monsanto saccharin from 30 Yanping Road, which were stored in a large room. Another room and the outside building stored 65 large steel windows and steel doors, 70 to 80 loads of bamboo steel bars, about 50,000 square feet of large pine boards, and 40 to 50 loads of water-flow iron sheets. The team member Wang Zenglue said that because the seal carried by Wang was not enough, he verbally instructed Zhou Yunshan and others to guard them. Except that Wang Zenglue did not seal the pine boards, steel windows, and steel doors because he could not determine that they were enemy assets, and the informer Chang Chang did not mention iron hooks, iron cables, bamboo steel bars, and water-flow iron plates, it was difficult to determine that they were enemy property. During the interrogation, Zhou Zhengfu, the owner of the Zhou Fook Kee Construction Factory, firmly stated that they were indeed materials used in the construction factory and were not enemy property, so Wang did not seal them. According to Wang Zenglue's original reply on November 1, 1945, 620 barrels of kerosene and diesel oil were seized at 360 Yanping Road, and the defendants had moved out four barrels from the number reported by the Mitsuura Company. On November 15, Wang reported that he and the informers had investigated 2,000 barrels of kerosene stored at 29 Tongjia Road, and the municipal government had sent personnel to escort them out of the factory, but no receipt was given. Chen Rongjian confessed that he had 2,498 small boxes of kerosene, 250 large iron barrels of kerosene, 95 large iron barrels of red car oil, and 129 large iron barrels of diesel oil, all of which were transported away by Shen Wenyuan using trucks numbered 25952 and 15206. The amount is very different, and it is undoubtedly a joint embezzlement by the defendants. After the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner's Office investigated and found that the report was true, it was impeached and transferred for disciplinary action. The Central Civil Servant Disciplinary Committee believed that it involved criminal suspicion and issued it to the Shanghai High Court Procuratorate for investigation. The Ministry of Justice also approved the Executive Yuan Secretariat's transfer of the original report based on the report by Zhang Zhenping and others, ordering the Shanghai High Court Procuratorate to investigate in succession on October 16, 1946. Based on the above process and facts, it is sufficient to determine the criminal evidence of the defendants Shen Wenyuan, Shen Zhenjia, Sun Qinchi, etc., as follows: The actions of the General Affairs Department of the Municipal Government in sending personnel to receive enemy assets, using enemy assets for transportation, and negotiating with Lu Shishang of the Receiving Group of the Third Front Army to stop the transportation of oil stored in Yanping Road, etc., are very important. Why did they not give the responsible personnel official documents in advance, and why did the responsible personnel not report in writing at any time afterwards? Even according to Shen Wenyuan's confession, the report on the name and quantity of received items had been handed over to Shen Zhenjia for transfer, but Sun Qinchi claimed to be busy and had no time to look at it carefully and sent it back for storage (the defendants Shen Zhenjia and Sun Qinchi did not deny this during the interrogation). It was not until the Supervisory Commissioner's Office thoroughly investigated that two or three written reports from the responsible personnel in this case were added to cover up. If Shen Zhenjia and Shen Wenyuan had not colluded together, how could Shen Wenyuan have arbitrarily stolen the sealed materials? At the time of receiving, he only hung an empty stamped paper at the door, considering it to be the fulfillment of his receiving duties. He did not report the details and always kept the detailed list made by the Japanese until he had been away from his job for a long time, still hiding it in his private hands. It is difficult to deny that he jointly stole public property. As the director of the General Affairs Department, Sun Qinchi was so careless in handling such important materials that had been received without authorization. Even if he cannot prove the exact amount of the distribution of benefits, he knew that his subordinates were corrupt and had evidence, but he protected them and did not report them. What else can he say to defend himself? Except that the other personnel who were sent to help with the receiving were all hired by Shen Wenyuan and Shen Zhenjia and should be dismissed, Zhou Yunshan, Zhang Jingyao, Zhou Fushan, also known as Zhou Zhengfu, and Chen Rongjian lack concrete evidence of stealing materials and only have the suspicion of passively jointly stealing. Their behavior of jointly stealing diesel oil with Zhou Yunshan and Zhang Jingyao should all be pardoned and dealt with separately. The defendants Shen Wenyuan and Shen Zhenjia are suspected of violating Article 28 of the Criminal Law and Article 3, Section 2 of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption. The defendant Sun Qinchi is suspected of violating Article 8 of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption and should be treated as an accomplice to Article 3, Section 2 of the same regulations. In accordance with Article 1, Section 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations and Article 230, Section 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the prosecution is initiated, Prosecutor Gu Anbiao. February 12, 1947.</p>
<h3>Emergency Measures to be Implemented Soon; Speculative Atmosphere Gradually Dissipates</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, various newspapers carried reports from Nanjing stating that the central authorities in Nanjing were planning measures to stabilize finance and the economy, with the expectation that they would be implemented within days. The speculative markets in gold, banknotes, and stocks in this city initially showed a strong and steady trend in the early morning, continuing the bullish momentum from the previous day's close. However, they quickly faltered and declined. The general trend in other commodity markets was a shift from rising to weakening. According to observations from several authoritative figures in the city's financial circles, the government will not ignore the current chaotic state of finance. They firmly believe that measures to stabilize finance will be publicly announced and implemented within days. It is hoped that the public will prioritize stability above all else. They believe that the main driver of recent financial fluctuations is the speculative psychology of the general market. Public unrest is a trap for speculators, ultimately leading to significant market volatility. According to analysis, the main sources of the vast amounts of floating capital currently flooding the market are: firstly, over 40 billion yuan in production loans issued for the Lunar New Year season in agricultural communities and mills; secondly, a large amount of floating capital gathered in Shanghai from other regions, mainly through remittances from various banks and financial institutions, but recently also increasingly through physical cash transfers due to remittance limits; and thirdly, year-end bonuses paid to employees by various companies, factories, and businesses. They believe that the main task for finance in the future is to guide this floating capital into productive channels. Once the floating capital finds its proper place, it will no longer be able to engage in speculation and mischief in the market.</p>
<p>Market Operators Become Wary; Gold and Banknotes Decline Simultaneously</p>
<p>(Report from Our Newspaper) The buying interest in the gold market collapsed yesterday. The market opened with a sharp drop to 7.6 million yuan. From a buying price of 7.3 million yuan, it briefly rose to 8.4 million yuan before falling back to 7.5 million yuan, where it gradually stabilized. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 350 taels at a price of 7.7 million yuan, causing renewed unrest, and the price rebounded to over 8.4 million yuan. Thereafter, the multiple facets of public fear automatically disintegrated the buying interest, and supply exceeded demand, driving the price down to 6.7 million yuan near noon. At noon, it rebounded to around 7.2 million yuan. In the afternoon, the next-day delivery market initially weakened to 6.8 million yuan, briefly advancing to 7.3 million yuan. Soon after, financial institutions sold off, and credit tightened. Rumors to halt the market spread, and after 3:00 PM, the market began to decline sharply to a low of 6.4 million yuan, before closing at 6.7 million yuan. Overall, it fell 1.75 million yuan compared to the previous close. Gold ornaments remained at 750,000 yuan. Silver dollars also fell significantly, with the interbank overnight lending rate gradually tightening from 15% to 18%.</p>
<p>Foreign Currencies Fell Yesterday; the unofficial market for US dollars opened between 15,000 and 16,000 yuan, rebounding to 17,700 yuan mid-session. Near noon, it fell along with the gold market to 13,500 yuan. Although it did not decline much further in the afternoon, it ultimately fell 4,000 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars initially started at 3,400 yuan in the morning, repeatedly declined slightly, and finally hovered between 2,700 and 2,800 yuan, also falling 800 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate experienced a chaotic market, and due to delayed reports from Shanghai, traders were unable to complete transactions, with supplies quoted at around 3,100 yuan. Indian Rupees were at 3,750 yuan. British pounds were at 49,500 yuan, all selling prices, with few transactions.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Decline</h3>
<p>Public bond prices fell significantly yesterday. Unified Series C opened at 3,400 yuan, followed by sell orders from the 360, 552 series, driving the price down to 2,900 yuan. The 604 series and others were slightly more accepting, and the price then rebounded to over 3,000 yuan. Ultimately, Series A and B fell 200 yuan compared to the previous close, Series C fell 400 yuan, Series D fell 50 yuan, and Series E fell 150 yuan, with a total transaction volume of approximately 8 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Also Decline</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks also saw declines yesterday. Ewo Cotton opened at 14,400 yuan, rose to 15,800 yuan, and then gradually declined. Smaller stocks rebounded after falling. Compared to the previous close, Ewo Cotton, British-American Tobacco, Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, Ewo Brewery, and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company each fell by more than 20%, while others fell by about 15%.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Meeting</h3>
<p>Lo Ching-hua's Urgent Proposal</p>
<p>Advising the Business Community to Exercise Self-Discipline</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce held a board meeting today. Mr. Lo Ching-hua put forward an urgent proposal, advising businesses and industries to jointly suppress prices, utilize the good practice of "colleague agreement," revive industry regulations, restore business ethics, and suggested that the government take the following emergency measures: (1) re-establish the gold policy, (2) implement linked import and export policies, (3) purchase materials to control prices, and (4) increase production and conserve consumption.</p>
<h3>Governor Pei Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>(Report from Our Newspaper) Mr. Pei Tsu-yi, Governor of the Central Bank, who went to Nanjing on official business on the evening of the 11th, is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the evening train yesterday, expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning. It is widely believed that Mr. Pei's trip is related to stabilizing Shanghai's financial market.</p>
<h3>Gold Shops' Retail Business Has Been Relatively Quiet Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Report from Our Newspaper) Yesterday morning, the Central Bank allocated 375 taels of gold to gold shops at a price of 7.7 million yuan. Initially, the gold shops quoted a price of 7.9 million yuan, but as the market gradually declined, the closing price in the afternoon was 6.4 million to 6.8 million yuan, and the gold shops lowered their quoted price to 7.5 million yuan. In the afternoon, the retail departments of various gold shops were no longer as busy as before, and many customers were selling gold. According to a major figure in the gold shop industry, when market prices fluctuate and fall, the gold shops are forced to lower prices to meet retail demand for the high-priced gold they have purchased, often resulting in losses. However, it is noted that the purchase prices of various gold shops are based on the lowest market prices at the time, and they also need to deduct 14,000 yuan for wear and tear. When selling gold, in addition to the quoted price, they also charge a handling fee based on the complexity of the jewelry's workmanship. For a simple ring, the labor cost alone is 1,200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Stabilizing Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Allows Shops and Individuals</p>
<p>To Purchase Siamese Rice at Negotiated Prices</p>
<p>To suppress rice prices, the Social Affairs Bureau, starting yesterday, allowed merchants and individuals to apply for purchasing rice at negotiated prices. Three bottles of rice samples were displayed in the fourth department. Although the rice was not of the highest quality, it was not too inferior and was suitable for consumption by merchants and factories. Yesterday, a steady stream of people visited the bureau to apply for purchases, priced at 70,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight).</p>
<h3>Black Market Prices for Japonica and Indica Rice Continue to Rise; Edible Oil Price Hikes Slightly Reduced</h3>
<p>Yesterday, only glutinous rice arrived at the source of rice. The South City Market had 79 stones of silver yuan rice, and the North City Market had 152 stones of white yuan rice and 29 stones of Xian yuan rice. Transactions were few, and prices rose again by 13,500 yuan. The Social Affairs Bureau's No. 2 Saigon rice continued to sell well. Another 31,380 bags of No. 2 rice were allocated, with 21,200 bags in the South City Market and 10,180 bags in the North City Market, and the price remained unchanged. Rice prices have risen sharply in recent days. Most rice merchants in the market yesterday seemed to be fearful. In addition, there have been no deliveries of Japonica and Indica rice recently, so they are afraid of the risk of hoarding and dare not release their stocks, so they are adopting a wait-and-see attitude and not doing business. The unofficial market price has risen by another 20,000 yuan. White Japonica rice is approaching 170,000 yuan, thin Indica rice has reached 160,000 yuan, and early-season Indica rice is around 150,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Riding on the strong momentum of the previous day, actual demand was quite robust, and market prices continued to reach new highs. Bingchuan flour reached the 60,000 yuan mark, and Lilang foreign flour (70 lbs) reached as high as 80,000 yuan. The prices of various brands of flour rose by 7,000 to 8,000 yuan faster than the previous day. Speculation in wheat bran remained hot, but due to a lack of actual sales, the situation was weak. Large bags were initially firm but then weakened, while small bags fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. There was still a shortage of wheat supply, and prices were around 72,000 to 73,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>The upward trend in prices has slightly abated, and the market is gradually turning bearish. Merchants are already thinking about selling at high prices, and the raw material peanut kernels have also fallen back, so digestion is also weakening. Barrel peanut oil has fallen by 15,000 yuan, and barrel peanut oil has also fallen by about 20,000 yuan. There is very little soybean oil available, and prices are mediocre. There have been no transactions in clear vegetable oil, etc., but sesame oil from small carts has actually risen again by 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Yellow soybeans were firm in the early morning, but afterwards the supply continued, and there were reports that several ships were about to arrive in port, so the market gradually became bearish. Large Ying soybeans fell from 85,000 yuan to 80,000 yuan, and the price of selected green soybeans was similar to the previous day. Red beans rose slightly by more than 2,000 yuan. Both sides were still buying sesame seeds, and prices continued to rise by 5,000 yuan. Mung beans were in good shape, and corn was similar. There was strong demand for raw peanuts, and the holders were crowding to sell them, so the market was weak and prices fell back by more than 20,000 yuan. There were no buyers in the later market. Soybean cake traders were still trying to struggle in the early morning, and prices were shouted up by 1,000 yuan, but due to poor digestion, they immediately fell back. The process was initially firm but then weakened.</p>
<p>Northern Goods Begin to Decline</p>
<p>Northern goods have risen a lot recently due to the gold rush, but they have started to decline. Sunflower seeds opened at 155,000 yuan, Tianjin red dates were priced between 250,000 yuan, Chen Gaozhuang yuan dates were 220,000 to 230,000 yuan, new Tongshou dates were 260,000 to 280,000 yuan, and Changping peaches were 210,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gasoline Imports Are Sufficient to Meet the Needs of the City</h3>
<p>$2.5 Million USD Per Quarter</p>
<p>Panic about gasoline has slightly improved since the price adjustment. According to relevant authorities, the rumors about the difficulty of importing gasoline are pure speculation. The authorities now stipulate that the import quota for gasoline is $2.5 million USD per quarter, which is sufficient to meet the needs of the city. Therefore, if car owners do not seize the opportunity to buy and hoard, the gasoline supply will not be disrupted.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Change Color Overnight; Limit-Up Becomes Limit-Down; The Market Is Filled with Sell Orders</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks plummeted with the general trend yesterday amid minor fluctuations. Some stocks even hit limit-down prices, opening sharply lower in the morning. Nos. 2, 3, 97, and 36 were sold, and Die Yong Cotton fell to 1,350 yuan. Nos. 198, 88, 12, 219, 145, and 154 were bought, but quickly rebounded to 1,440 yuan. Nos. 192, 27, 20, and 97 were briefly sold at 1,370 yuan. As the gold market rebounded, Nos. 145, 14, 156, 76, 154, and 12 were bought, and the price rose to 1,455 yuan. Nos. 198, 158, 20, 152, 70, 117, 224, 198, and 171 were sold off. As the price of gold gradually declined, Die Yong Cotton was briefly quoted as low as 1,260 yuan (because there were no transactions, the low price was 1,270 yuan). At this time, Mei Ah, King Fung, Match Company, and Qinxing all hit the limit down, and there were even discount transactions.

<h3>Rubber Raw Material Inventory Is Depleted; Requesting That the Transportation and Management Committee Relax Import Quotas</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Rubber Industry Association of this city recently stated that the inventory of raw materials in Shanghai is depleted. Out of the 800 tons of rubber recently approved for temporary import by the Quota Allocation Office of the Transportation and Management Committee, finished products and used tires accounted for half, and raw rubber accounted for only 400 tons, which is not enough for the use of various rubber factories in the city for one week. Most factories will be forced to stop production. Therefore, yesterday, more than ten representatives of the association, including Hong Nianzu, specially brought a written statement at 9:30 AM to the Quota Allocation Office of the Transportation and Management Committee, requesting that the import quota for rubber be relaxed. The director of the allocation office, Li Gan, happened to be in Nanjing on official business, and the deputy director, Shen, received them on his behalf and provided the following answers based on the presentation: (1) The processing of finished products and raw materials should be handled separately, which is often agreed upon. (2) The import quota for rubber in January will be announced after the 15th of this month. Whether the quota can be relaxed as requested is still under consideration. (3) Regarding the transportation of rubber stored in Hong Kong to Shanghai, the allocation office stated that the quota has already been allocated to various importers in this city, and the importers may not be related to the rubber stored in Hong Kong, so this point is also still under consideration.</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Importing Chemical Raw Materials</h3>
<p>(Report from Our Newspaper) A person in charge of a chemical raw material business in Shanghai said that since the Transportation and Management Committee listed chemical raw materials in the second category, the import of chemical raw materials has been greatly affected. Most of the applications for import have not been approved, resulting in a general increase in the price of chemical raw materials due to supply falling short of demand. However, the general price is still not high enough compared to the black market for US dollars. Various businesses are deeply concerned that they will not be able to replenish their stocks after they are sold out, so most of the transactions are very quiet. At present, the price of caustic soda has risen two times compared to the past, and the price of sulfuric acid has also risen more than one time. Other materials such as potassium red salt vaseline, percarbonate, etc., have also risen by one or two times. Although China manufactures caustic soda, the amount is not large, and transportation is difficult. Except for the China Textile Company ordering one million tons, it is not enough to meet the needs of various manufacturers. China also makes its own alcohol, so the price is relatively stable. However, the manufacturing is not precise, and the quality is not pure, so it can hardly compare with foreign goods. In general, China relies on foreign countries for most of its chemical raw materials. If the import methods cannot be improved, the difficulties encountered by China's chemical industry will become more serious every day.</p>
<h3>Food Rationing Prices Remain Unchanged; Rationing Methods Remain the Same as Last Time</h3>
<p>The 14th meeting of the Sugar Council was held at the Social Affairs Bureau at 3 PM yesterday. The discussion of the rationing method remained the same as decided at the previous meeting, that is, the amount of refined sugar allocated this term is one-quarter of the total amount applied for by each household in the first to fourth terms. Households that did not apply for sugar rationing in the first to fourth terms will be allocated ten bags of sugar this term. The price issue was also decided not to be changed. The price of raw and red sugar is still 140,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight).</p>
<p>Sugar Prices Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was initially firm but then weakened. When the news of the decline in gold prices came, the price of all sugars fell. The current price of raw sugar officially marked by the association was 270,000 yuan in the morning, 250,000 yuan later, and 245,000 yuan in the afternoon. The price of raw sugar and red sugar was 210,000 yuan. The prices of both second and fourth grade white sugar and Peruvian fine sugar were 245,000 yuan. The price of Nosun Takqing opened at 172,000 yuan in the morning, then fell to 165,000 yuan, the price of regular sugar was 160,000 yuan to 155,000 yuan, the price of Xinghua white sugar was 255,000 yuan to 250,000 yuan, and the price of Xing red sugar was 190,000 yuan. More than 500 pieces were transacted.</p>
<p>Also, the Taiwan Company's sugar prices will remain the same today, and the amount allocated will also be the same as in the previous period. However, each firm must have two guarantors to ensure that they do not engage in black market activities. If this is the case, the price of sugar may be stabilized in the future.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Rise and Fall Suddenly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market experienced three twists and turns. In the early morning, the market was very nervous due to the fall in gold prices. 20-count special double horse yarn opened at 5 million, a sharp drop of 1 million compared to the previous day. Ordinary 20-count yarn also fell by 500,000 to 600,000. For example, Shuiyue Lima was traded at around 3.8 million. Then, the factory increased its purchases because the textile construction listing price was 400,000 to 800,000 higher than the market price. Shuiyue Lanfeng therefore recovered to 4.2 million, which was the high point of the day. However, this was short-lived. Soon after, yarn number sellers offered their yarn in abundance, and the price entered the 4 million mark again. The final transaction price was 3.95 million. There was a range of 400,000 yuan that day, and the result was a drop of 500,000 to 1 million yuan compared to the previous day. People were quite uneasy.</p>
<h3>Textile Management Committee to Meet Today to Discuss Yarn Purchase Prices</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the Textile Management Committee started processing applications for the southward transport of yarn and cloth on Monday of this week, as of yesterday, the number of southward transport approvals has totaled 3,743 pieces of cotton yarn and 9,599 bolts of cloth. In addition, the notice issued by the committee to various factories to purchase cotton yarn has also been collected. The committee is also issuing purchase notices in succession. The committee is scheduled to hold a regular meeting this afternoon. At that time, the new principles for discussing the negotiated purchase price of cotton yarn will be discussed.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Sells Yarn</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Textile Construction Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, with a total of 995 pieces sold. Manufacturers accounted for 880 pieces, and yarn numbers accounted for 115 pieces. The number of applicants was 413 manufacturers and 54 yarn numbers.</p>
<p>Chinese Fir Drastically Drops</p>
<p>Regarding the timber market, the sharp rise in Chinese fir prices in recent days was due to the relationship with gold prices. Yesterday, affected by the fall in gold prices, Chinese fir prices fell drastically, while foreign fir prices fell only slightly.</p>
<h3>Earnest Money for Delivery</h3>
<p>Advance Payment Time</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In recent days, the Chinese stock market has fluctuated greatly due to the influence of gold and banknotes. Yesterday, the Securities Exchange decided to temporarily advance the payment time for earnest money by half an hour, and all payments must be cleared before 11:15 AM the next day. Once the market returns to normal, the original time will be announced and restored.</p>
<h3>Shipping Companies Purchasing Ships from Overseas Must Meet Three Standards</h3>
<p>Since the victory, shipping companies in our country have been ordering merchant ships from overseas in a very considerable amount. The Ministry of Communications has stipulated that merchant ships ordered overseas by various shipping companies in the future must meet the following three standards: (1) The ship's age must be less than 30 years, (2) The draft must be less than 18 feet, and (3) The speed must be more than 10 miles per hour. It is said that this regulation of the Ministry of Communications is to facilitate foreign exchange settlement work, because the foreign exchange audit office of the Central Bank is very strict in auditing the foreign exchange settlement work for the purchase of ships. In the future, if the above standards can be met, the Central Bank will approve the foreign exchange settlement.</p>

<p>[Associated Press Hong Kong, 12th] According to import and export statistics, the amount of gold imported into Hong Kong in January of this year was more than twice the amount imported in the entire year of 1946.

<h3>Director of the Education Department of the Taiwan Provincial Government, Fan Shou-kang, Goes to Beijing to Report on His Work; Yesterday He Passed Through Shanghai to Discuss the Educational Situation in Taiwan Province</h3>
<p>Mr. Fan Shou-kang, Director of the Education Department of the Taiwan Provincial Governor's Office, recently passed through Shanghai from Taiwan and is about to go to Beijing to report on his work to the Ministry of Education and to request instructions. When a reporter visited him to inquire about the past and current educational situation in the province, Mr. Fan informed him:</p>
<p>Educational Facilities</p>
<p>The Education Department of the Taiwan Provincial Governor's Office was formally established on October 25, 1945, and is responsible for educational administration, academic culture, and other matters throughout the province. In the past year or so, the department's educational facilities can be divided into three important stages. The first is the takeover period, from November 1, 1945, to the end of March of last year. In addition to establishing educational administrative institutions and taking over educational institutions, it also followed Governor Chen's principle of uninterrupted administration, factories not stopping work, and schools not stopping classes, trying to ensure that schools continued to hold classes and establishing the province's educational policy. The second is the preparation period, from April 1 to the end of July of last year, during which the department engaged in reforms and preparations for promoting education in accordance with established policies. The third is the implementation period of reform and promotion of education, from August of last year until now. Through these three stages, a foundation has indeed been laid for the development of education in Taiwan Province. Currently, in order to thoroughly eliminate the colonial education policy implemented by the Japanese in the past, the department has formulated an educational policy to promote the Three Principles of the People, cultivate national culture, instill practical knowledge and skills, encourage academic research, and especially emphasize equal educational opportunities.</p>
<p>Overview of Schools</p>
<p>Regarding school units in Taiwan Province, in higher education, there was the Taipei Imperial University, Taipei Economics College, Taichung Agricultural and Forestry College, and Tainan Industrial College in the past. After the restoration, all of these units were taken over one by one. Currently, Taipei Imperial University has been renamed National Taiwan University and is managed by the Ministry of Education, with a large scale. In addition to the five colleges of Liberal Arts and Political Science, Science, Agriculture, Medicine, and Engineering, it also has an affiliated medical department and a university preparatory course. The other schools have also been renamed by the department as Taiwan Provincial Taipei Commercial College, Taiwan Provincial Taichung Agricultural College, and Taiwan Provincial Tainan Industrial College. However, in the past year, there have been many changes due to continuous adjustments. For example, the above-mentioned provincial colleges were changed to the Provincial College of Law and Commerce in January of last year, and Taichung Agricultural College and Tainan Industrial College were changed to established colleges by the department in August of last year. Secondary Education: During the Japanese occupation, there were 18 public middle schools, 20 girls' high schools, and 25 vocational schools. After the restoration, the department sent personnel to take them over separately, and the names of the schools were also changed, and classes continued. In terms of national education: According to the department's statistics in August of last year, there were 1,048 national schools in the province, with 13,524 classes, a total of 890,597 students (including 15,429 students over the school age), and a total of 14,859 teachers. The total number of school-age children in the province was 1,062,527, of whom 875,168 were enrolled, accounting for 82.37%, and 187,359 were not enrolled, accounting for 17.63%. The above figures are slightly better than the statistics before the restoration. As for the total national education expenditure in the province last year, it totaled NT$345,351,492, all of which was the responsibility of the counties (cities) to raise themselves.</p>
<h3>The Xinwen Bao Newspaper Office Recently Established a Journalism Education Scholarship</h3>

The journalism departments of the above three universities will each be allocated three places for the third and fourth grades, with each student receiving a subsidy of 1 million national currency per semester. All third and fourth grade students in the journalism departments of the three universities who are healthy, of good character, from impoverished families, and have excellent academic performance, with scores of 85 or above in Chinese, English, history, and geography, may apply to the journalism department of each university in accordance with the regulations, and this will begin in the current semester.</p>
<h3>More Than 300 Students from Private Schools Petitioned the Municipal Education Bureau Yesterday, Demanding Protection for Impoverished Students to Prevent Them from Dropping Out of School</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Student Academic Protection Association, at 2:30 p.m. yesterday, gathered more than 300 students from eighteen middle schools, including Nanmo, Huxin, Jiaotong, Zhaoguang, Jiancheng, Mulun, YMCA, China Women's Middle School, Zhirenyong, Zhengzhong, and East China, and marched to the Municipal Education Bureau to petition, holding paper flags, shouting slogans in front of the square, posting slogans everywhere, and distributing declarations, making four demands: (1) Demand that the authorities immediately issue 500 million yuan in subsidies for private schools to be used as scholarships. (2) Demand that the authorities thoroughly investigate all accounts of educational loans and issue the remaining educational loan funds, using all principal and interest as scholarships. (3) Demand that the authorities protect impoverished students, allowing them to attend classes first, to prevent them from dropping out of school. (4) Demand a substantial increase in educational funding to 35% as stipulated by the constitution, subsidizing private schools, improving teacher salaries, and reducing the burden on parents. Director Xie of the Secondary Education Department of the Municipal Education Bureau replied: (1) The municipal government has not yet issued the 500 million yuan subsidy for private schools, and an application can be made to the municipal government for its issuance. (2) The educational loan matter is the responsibility of the Municipal Education Association, and the Education Bureau can send someone to investigate thoroughly. (3) The Education Bureau expresses deep sympathy for helping impoverished students and preventing them from dropping out of school, and has previously issued an order to all schools to set a quota of 20% for full exemptions and 10% for half-fee exemptions. If all schools in the city with 80,000 middle school students can earnestly comply with this regulation, then 16,000 students can be fully exempt and 8,000 students can be half exempt. The Education Bureau is currently thoroughly investigating whether the schools are complying. If the quota for free places is full and there are still impoverished students, then I can personally request the principals of the schools to allow them to be free or half fee. In short, the Education Bureau has tried every means to ensure that all impoverished students have books to read. Regarding the guarantee of allowing them to attend classes first, if an application for free or half fee has been submitted but not yet approved, they can attend classes first and complete the formalities later. (4) Raising educational funding must be submitted by the municipal government to the Municipal Council for a decision, and the Education Bureau also hopes to achieve this. Director Xie also said that individual problems can be resolved individually and there is no need for collective activities. Each school can fill out a form for its impoverished students and submit it to the Education Bureau for review. If they are indeed impoverished, a guarantee will be provided to ensure that they do not drop out of school. The petitioning students were satisfied and dispersed at 5:15 p.m.</p>
<h3>Soochow Physics Professor, Lu Hongyu, Returns to China</h3>
<p>Dr. Lu Hongyu, Professor of the Physics Department of Soochow University, went to the United States in the summer of 1941 and entered the Virginia Polytechnic Institute to specialize in industrial physics. A year later, the school, recognizing Lu's excellent academic performance, hired him to stay at the school as a lecturer. In 1943, Lu went to Johns Hopkins University to study spectroscopy in order to further his studies, and at the same time, he accepted a commission from the U.S. War Production Board to research specialized problems. In 1945, Dr. Robertson, the director of the Physics Department of Virginia Polytechnic Institute, personally went to Johns Hopkins and urged Lu to return to the school to serve as an associate professor. Last fall, when the United Nations General Assembly was held in the United States, Lu and Dr. Wei Xueren represented China at the scientific and technical group of the Atomic Energy Commission, bringing together atomic energy experts from Britain, the United States, France, Canada, the Netherlands, and other countries to discuss the issue together. Recently, due to the repeated urging of Dr. Yang Yongqing, the president of Soochow University, in the United States, he resigned from his position at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and returned by ship. He arrived at the end of last month, just as the spring semester of Soochow University began. The faculty and students of the entire university were extremely pleased that Professor Lu, who has an international reputation, had returned to the school, making the faculty of the Soochow University School of Science even more complete. A few days ago, Lu went to Beijing to report to the relevant authorities on his attendance at the United Nations General Assembly. After completing his official duties, he will return to Suzhou to teach.</p>
<p>Dr. Yang Yongqing Will Return to China Soon</p>
<p>It is also learned that Dr. Yang Yongqing, the president of Soochow University and a renowned diplomat, engaged in international propaganda work in the United States during the Anti-Japanese War, and his contributions were very great. Since the victory, he intended to return to China immediately to preside over the work of restoring the school. However, Ambassador Gu Weijun strongly urged him to go to England to assist in the preparations for the United Nations. He then returned to the United States and was appointed as an advisor to the Chinese delegation to the United Nations General Assembly. Most of the important speeches given by Ambassador Gu, the chief representative of China, at the General Assembly were written by Yang. Yang also represented China on the Economic and Social Council, a mission of great importance, which delayed his departure. Now that the United Nations General Assembly closed in December of last year, and Yang's fundraising for the restoration of Soochow University among American churches is also coming to an end, he will be able to return to China with funds in the near future to meet the urgent needs of Soochow University.</p>
<p>Dr. Sheng Zhenwei Will Go Abroad for Study</p>
<p>As for Dr. Sheng Zhenwei, the acting president of Soochow University, is a famous legal scholar in China. In recent years, in addition to presiding over the affairs of the university's law school, he has also served as the acting president, enabling Soochow University to quickly restore its school in one and a half years. It is reported that Sheng will soon go to Europe and the United States with Wu Shangying, the secretary-general of the Legislative Yuan, to study law.</p>

<h3>Jiaotong University Basketball Team Loses to Chengyou Red</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Jiaotong University basketball team and Chengyou Red held a friendly match at the university's gymnasium at 7:30 p.m. last night. More than 1,000 Jiaotong University students watched the game. The match was not very exciting. Li Zhenzhong was not present, so the small cat could not catch the big mouse. Although they were able to force a 14-14 tie in the first half, they ultimately lost to Chengyou Red with a score of 28-39 due to bad luck. The match report is as follows:</p>
<p>After the referee Zhang Jianbing blew the whistle, Jiaotong University's Yang Xiehe made the first score with a layup under the basket. Chengyou Red's He Zheng sent a long shot and scored two consecutive goals. Li Miaocheng and Tao Rongshi added icing on the cake, and the first quarter ended. Chengyou Red took the lead with a score of 8-2. Seeing the unfavorable situation, Jiaotong University quickly chased after them, and Shen Beizhang scored first. Yang Xiehe came from all directions, tying the score at 10-10. The first half ended with a 14-14 tie.</p>
<p>After drinking Coca-Cola, they switched sides and fought again. Chengyou Red's offense started again, and He Zheng repeatedly surged forward. Wang Cunrui's long shot was a strange basket. Jiaotong University lacked luck and lacked a central commander. At the end of the third quarter, they fell behind with a score of 22-27. In the final quarter, Jiaotong University was distracted and made many mistakes. The defense was also empty. Yuan Peiyuan was unable to participate in the war due to a hand injury. As a result, Chengyou Red defeated Jiaotong University with a score of 39-28.</p>

<h3>Shanghai is Willing to Host This Year's National Games; Director Gu Invites Hao Gengsheng; Municipal Stadium Can be Repaired in Two Months</h3>
<p>Hao Gengsheng, a physical education supervisor from the Ministry of Education, accompanied by Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, Jiang Xiangqing, Director of the Municipal Stadium, and under the guidance of Lu Xiangqian, drove to Jiangwan at 12:00 noon yesterday to inspect the Municipal Stadium. They carefully inspected all the buildings, from the Municipal Sports Ground to the Municipal Gymnasium to the Municipal Swimming Pool, regardless of whether they were complete or damaged. They did not neglect even the smallest room. The time spent on the scene totaled two hours. After the inspection, Director Gu resolutely invited Supervisor Hao, saying, "Shanghai is willing to gladly host the 7th National Games, as well as the World Games selection event. The Municipal Stadium will be repaired for the event, and the Chinese World Games delegation is welcome to issue an invitation to the Olympic Committee in London next year, so that the 1952 or 1956 Games can be held in Shanghai." At 2:30 p.m., the four returned to a Western restaurant on Weihaiwei Road for lunch and discussed the matter until 4:30 p.m. Supervisor Hao is scheduled to return to Beijing by early train today. There may be new developments in the National Games in the short term. Furthermore, engineers estimated yesterday that the Municipal Stadium can be repaired within two and a half months.</p>

<h3>A New Artery for Developing the Economy of Fujian Province: Surveying the Fuzhou-Xiamen Highway</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Fuzhou, 3rd Day of the Month, Our Newspaper Correspondent Chen Zhengyu</p>
<p>As early as the 15th year of the Republic, Southern Fujian sought to facilitate the smooth flow of trade in local specialties and thus pooled funds to construct the Fuzhou-Xiamen Highway. This route started in Fuzhou, heading south through Fuqing, Putian, Hui'an, Jinjiang (Quanzhou), Nan'an, Tong'an, and other counties, reaching Jiaowei, where it connected with the Zhang(zhou)-Song(yu) Highway. The entire length was 297 kilometers. At the time, it was built in sections, and it was not until the 18th year of the Republic that the entire line was opened to traffic. Although the road surface engineering did not reach standardization, it had become the only lifeline of communication in Southeast China and one of the most frequently used transportation routes in Fujian Province.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance in the 27th year of the Republic, Xiamen Island fell successively. The road, built along the coast and located in a crucial area, was ordered to be thoroughly destroyed. The original 253 beams and 168 culverts and 504 water pipes along the entire line were almost completely damaged. Even the famous Luoyang Bridge in Hui'an, which was 530 meters long, was blown up. Most of the roadbed along the entire line was turned into fields. The thoroughness of the destruction is evident.</p>
<p>After the victory, the authorities of Fujian Province believed that the repair of the road was closely related to the economic development of Fujian Province and planned to start the repair work immediately. However, given the financial situation of the provincial authorities, they were absolutely unable to complete this vast project. Therefore, after further consultations with the central authorities in Beijing and Shanghai by Zhu Daijie, the head of the Provincial Construction Department, and Zhang Jiucheng, the head of the Provincial Highway Bureau, the Road Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, UNRRA, CNRRA, and the Fujian Construction Department jointly undertook the road reconstruction project. It is scheduled to be completed in June this year, at which time the entire line should be open to traffic.</p>
<p>Principles of Supply from All Parties Confirmed</p>
<p>In addition to the earthwork for the entire line, which has been restored by utilizing the national compulsory labor service to conscript laborers from various counties along the line, the remainder is the construction of bridges, culverts, waterways, and road surface paving. Initially, the Provincial Construction Department sent personnel to conduct an on-site survey with UNRRA engineer Grace, and they all agreed that it was appropriate to build the road with machinery. UNRRA can allocate road-building machinery to Fujian, but more than 12,000 yuan is still required for technical expertise, transportation costs, wages, and raw materials. Since the provincial government has limited financial resources, it petitioned the central government for allocation. Later, due to severe price fluctuations, the budget had to be increased and revised. After Director Zhang repeatedly consulted with the central government, the Ministry of Communications agreed to subsidize 1.5 billion yuan for the project costs and allowed the allocation of more than 5,000 tons of cement needed for the entire road at a price of 1.55 billion yuan, including transportation costs. The provincial government is responsible for 2 billion yuan of the project costs. Therefore, the central and provincial governments are jointly responsible for approximately 5 billion yuan. UNRRA will supply road-building machinery and equipment such as steel bars, corrugated pipes, bulldozers, crushers, rock drills, road graders, concrete mixers, repair machines, material transport vehicles, and all the necessary fuel consumption for the machinery. CNRRA will be responsible for wages and transportation costs for the machinery (including temporary docks for loading and unloading machinery and the construction of simple access roads), totaling 7.2 billion yuan. Therefore, excluding machinery and fuel, the total cost of labor and materials for this road is approximately 12.2 billion yuan. The principles of supply from all four parties have been confirmed, and a contract has been signed. The Ministry of Communications has specially assigned the Third Mechanical Road Construction Brigade of the Road Bureau to Fujian to assist in technical work a month ago.</p>
<p>To facilitate the progress and management of the project, the Fuzhou-Xiamen Highway Reconstruction Project Office was established on October 12 last year, with Zhang, the head of the Highway Bureau, concurrently serving as the director. According to Director Zhang's statement to reporters, if the supply from all parties does not encounter problems and prices do not affect the budget, the road can be completed in six months.</p>
<p>The Entire Line is Divided into Six Sections for Construction</p>
<p>According to the project office's plan, the entire line is divided into six sections for construction. The road-building machinery supplied by UNRRA is expected to be shipped from Shanghai to Fujian around early February. Before the arrival of this machinery, the project office has completed most of the bridge and culvert projects in the first section, and the Third Mechanical Road Construction Brigade of the Road Bureau has set out to prepare for construction in the second to sixth sections.</p>
<p>Paving with Hard Work and Sweat</p>
<p>The road is 297 kilometers long and is located in the area with the best climate, densest population, and abundant products in Fujian Province. According to informal estimates, the population in the areas along the line and its branches reaches 7 million, accounting for approximately 60% of the total population of the province. Because the area along the line is in a subtropical zone and the climate is regulated by sea breezes, it is very suitable for fruit cultivation. After the road is repaired, it can stimulate overseas remittances from overseas Chinese and overseas investment, which is equivalent to opening a source of wealth for Fujian Province. At the same time, the prosperity of the rural areas in southeastern Fujian is sure to be just around the corner.</p>
<p>When the reporter set off to visit the starting point of the Fuzhou-Xiamen Highway, the workers told the reporter that the paving of this roadbed alone was done by hundreds of thousands of laborers along the line who braved the heat and resisted wind and snow, paving it with their hard work and sweat for a long time. For the smooth flow of traffic and the post-war reconstruction of the country, they shed blood and sweat without complaint. According to Director Zhang, the use of machinery to build roads in the country, except for the Yunnan-Burma Road under British technical support, is still a pioneering effort. The road is 6 meters wide and the road surface is 20 centimeters thick, which is considered a new highway with very high standards. Moreover, due to the use of machinery for construction, the roadbed is solid, and in places with excessive curves, rock drills can be used to widen the road surface to ensure driving safety.</p>
<p>People in Beijing and Shanghai Will Be Able to Eat Inexpensive Fujian Fruit in the Summer and Autumn This Year</p>
<p>The reporter frequently asked Director Zhang about the difficulties in the construction process of this road. Zhang quickly shook his head. He replied that there were no technical problems, but the price fluctuations in Fujian Province were too severe to control the budget. In extremely difficult circumstances, the aforementioned 12.2 billion yuan of project costs have been pooled together. Will it be enough for the second half of the construction? If the project costs have to be increased again due to price fluctuations, it will be a major problem, because the expenses borne by all parties for this road have reached saturation.</p>
<p>However, Zhang repeatedly told reporters that no matter what, we will continue to work on it. In short, the road must be repaired. Yes, the suffocation of Fujian's economy is due to the sluggish sales of Fujian's specialties. Facilitating the export trade of Fujian's specialties will not only help the people of Fujian, but also help international trade. Can't Fujian's tea and lacquerware earn foreign exchange? The completion of the Fuzhou-Xiamen Road is undoubtedly the lifeline of Fujian's economic recovery. Director Zhang has been engaged in engineering for nearly 20 years and participated in the engineering design of the Yunnan-Burma Road during the War of Resistance, and he has a wealth of experience. The proposal to repair the Fuzhou-Xiamen Road this time was made by Director Zhang to the Ministry of Communications in Beijing, and he obtained the consent and support of the central authorities. Today, Fujian Province's finances are extremely tight, but Director Zhang and Zhu Daijie, the head of the Construction Department, both have firm confidence in the restoration of this road. The reporter believes that under the hard work of the two, the entire line can be opened to traffic in June this year, adding a splendid chapter to the history of Fujian's highways and benefiting the people of Fujian. Moreover, after the road is opened, the export of fruit from southeastern Fujian will be facilitated, and because of the reduction in transportation costs, prices will fall. People in Beijing and Shanghai will be able to eat inexpensive Fujian fruit in the summer and autumn this year.</p>

<h3>The Yellow River Wound is Not Yet Healed: Xue Dubi Arrives in Zhengzhou to Revise the Prescription</h3>
<p>— Zhengzhou Dispatch, 4th Day of the Month, Lie Bing</p>
<p>The issue of closing the Huayuankou breach is being debated by the government and the CCP. At the same time, as the Yellow River's ice flood rises and ice floes have already rushed out to the breach, Xue Dubi, Chairman of the National Water Conservancy Committee, suddenly flew in from Beijing on the 28th of last month to inspect the breach closure project and held a meeting at Huayuankou the next day to discuss it for two consecutive days. The breach closure project has reached an urgent stage.</p>
<p>In early December last year, the breach closure bureau replenished the wooden stakes that were washed away during the Fupi period and actively threw stones to build a stone dam under the temporary bridge, raising the water level upstream of the breach by about two meters. The project was progressing very smoothly. On the night of the 27th, a gale did a good deed, urging the</p>
<p>Yellow River</p>
<p>to rush through the diversion channel breach and enter the old channel. The hope of closing the breach was about to become a reality. Unexpectedly, the CCP, like before the Fupi flood last year, came out to cause trouble again when the breach closure was about to be completed, raising issues other than technical ones on January 5th. While Xue Dubi was negotiating with UNRRA and the CCP in Shanghai, the water level of the Yellow River in Shanzhou was rising, and by the time of the second negotiation, the flow had exceeded the highest record of previous ice floods, increasing to over 2,320 cubic meters per second. Eight rows of wooden stakes in the middle section of the breach's temporary bridge followed the flow one after another within three days. Around the Lunar New Year's Eve, there was heavy snowfall in various parts of the Northwest for days, and the construction site was swept by biting winds, with snowflakes swirling and falling. A stone-throwing worker was blown off the temporary bridge into the river and almost became a frozen chicken. The diversion channel that had already been flooded froze over, and the water could only flow slowly from the bottom of the river, reducing the flow by two-tenths compared to the original flow. Such a drastic change is truly astounding, and it is no wonder that Director Zhu of the breach closure bureau shed tears and sighed long on the night of New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>On the morning that Xue Dubi arrived in Zhengzhou, the flood control project in the Zhoukou area of the Shaying River basin also faced great</p>
<p>danger</p>
<p>due to the impact of ice floes. Although there were two ice-breaking teams downstream of Tongguan using explosives to break the ice, the ice floes flowing into the Shaying River in Zhoukou were still one centimeter thick and the size of a tabletop. On that day, on the northwest corner of the Beizhai in Zhoukou, between the Ying Shui Temple and the Lao Gui Wo, the rough hemp ropes on the sweeper, which was more than a li long and made of bricks and willow branches, were cut off by the ice blades. Near the Beiguan in Shuizhai, sixty li downstream of Zhoukou, the water level rose to 3.2 meters, and the water surface was level with the fourth-level embankment. If it rose another two meters, the Yellow River would overflow the riverbed and flood the fields. The embankment project above Yuanzhai between Zhoukou and Shuizhai was also washed away by ice floes and rapid currents for eighty meters. In recent days, the weather has warmed, and the Shaying River has begun to thaw, but the river surface upstream of Huayuankou is still flowing with ice. Generally speaking, the ice flood will roughly end after the Lunar Lichun (February 4th), but the early spring wind melts the ice floes before the extreme flood, and the water level will also rise, and the water势 will inevitably become more turbulent, and the flood control project on the Shaying River may face extremely dangerous phenomena. As for whether there will be problems in Huaguokou, no one dares to make a judgment in advance, and even Director Zhu did not anticipate the recent changes on the breach.</p>
<p>So when will the breach closure project be completed? Two days before Xue Dubi arrived in Zhengzhou, the breach closure bureau had re-proposed a plan, deciding to change the original method of flat closure to</p>
<p>vertical closure</p>
<p>The so-called vertical closure is to first build side dams and crib dams on both sides of the temporary bridge, proceeding simultaneously from east and west, extending to the middle, and closing the intact part of the bridge. Then, sunken willow mattresses are thrown in the gap without wooden piles to completely close the breach. In addition, a diversion channel is dug downstream of the breach (old riverbed). The supplementary materials required are 24 million catties of willow branches and reeds, and a total of 80,000 of three types of wooden piles, which the bureau will price and ask the six counties near the construction site, Zheng County, Zhongmu, Kaifeng, Guangwu, Yuanwu, and Yangwu, to purchase on its behalf, with a deadline for complete delivery by the end of February. The purchase price of the materials, totaling 1.17 billion yuan, has been distributed to the counties by the bureau. After Xue Dubi arrived in Zhengzhou, he made a final decision to increase the originally planned one diversion channel to three in order to allow half of the river's flow to enter, and the impact force on the breach would also be reduced by half.</p>
<p>The work of building side dams and crib dams has now begun, and the materials purchased by the counties are being transported urgently in recent days.</p>
<p>At the gap in the Yellow River levee at Huayuankou, a difficult-to-treat sore, it has been ten full months from the beginning of the operation to today, and after two "deadlines," the wound has not yet healed and healed. The main reason is that problems outside of the technique are interfering, and at the same time, the water of the Yellow River is more difficult to grasp than a woman's heart, and often when you touch the edge of her heart, her heart changes again. It is said that Xue Dubi came to Zheng to revise the original diagnosis and hope that problems other than technical ones will no longer occur, and even more hope that the water of the Yellow River will no longer be coquettish. Then, before the Meiyu flood in April, let us all celebrate the completion of this great project.</p>
<h3>Like Kuling, Also Like Rome! The Magnificent Golden Gate Bay</h3>
<p>— San Francisco Dispatch, 4th Day of the Month, Our Newspaper Correspondent Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>Here, I need to introduce the geographical situation of San Francisco. San Francisco is a name that can be large or small, just like the difference between New York and "Greater New York." When people usually say New York City or New York, they are referring to the city center of "Manhattan." The so-called eight million people of New York usually include areas outside of Manhattan such as the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens. San Francisco is the same. Greater San Francisco is an entire bay area, which Americans call the Bay Area. The Bay Area is like a reversed "C" shape, and ships stop inside the C-shaped bay. The gate to the bay is called the "Golden Gate," and the Golden Gate Bridge (the world's most famous bridge) spans the gate. At the two ends of the Golden Gate Bridge are two small peninsulas, and the one in the south is what is known as San Francisco, which is also commonly referred to as Gold Mountain.</p>
<p>Gold Mountain is the commercial center of the Bay Area. The entire peninsula is composed of seven uneven hills, somewhat similar to the "City of Seven Hills" of ancient Rome. "Rome wasn't built in a day," and Gold Mountain has been developing for nearly a hundred years. Even today, Gold Mountain is not a first-class metropolis in the United States. Many Chinese friends, at least myself, had an overestimation of San Francisco before coming to Gold Mountain. That view is wrong. San Francisco still has only 800,000 people, and its business and municipal administration are far behind first-class cities like New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Detroit. Even taking the entire Gold Mountain peninsula as a whole, the bustling streets and commercial areas occupy only one-ninth of the peninsula.</p>
<p>"All roads in the world lead to Rome," and San Francisco is the same. Gold Mountain is now the starting point and end point of Pacific routes, a necessary stop for airplanes, and the starting point and end point of transcontinental railways and highways in North America. If we put aside these big topics, just look at the Bay Area itself, how many ships are docked across the bay, as well as the famous Golden Gate Bridge, and the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, which is actually longer than the Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
<p>The Golden Gate Bridge runs from the southern part of the San Francisco Peninsula to the northern peninsula, which is called Richmond and is also a residential area. The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge spans the interior of the bay, from the San Francisco Peninsula to Oakland and Berkeley.</p>
<p>San Francisco Tower (Sent by Our Newspaper Correspondent Mao Shuqing)</p>
<h3>University of California: Affiliated "Chinese College"</h3>
<p>Oakland has some factories, newspapers, and large-scale department stores. Berkeley is the location of the University of California and also the most ideal residential area. Oakland and Berkeley were originally connected pieces of land, but they were divided into two areas for ease of distinction and administrative management. For example, California is the province in the United States that produces the most fruit and also the province that produces the most wine. To prevent the students of the University of California from indulging in "cup things," alcohol is prohibited in Berkeley, but in Oakland, you can drink freely. Alcohol and opium are different after all. It feels a bit uneconomical for young American teenagers to run several miles to drink alcohol, and over time, they quit it invisibly.</p>
<p>The University of California includes eight different units. The main campus and school administration center are in Berkeley. The entire school has 40,800 students, including affiliated colleges, making it the largest school in the United States today. The courses in the undergraduate and graduate schools are known for their strictness. The teaching methods are generally similar to those of the University of Chicago, except for the difference between the semester system and the quarter system. President Sproul is famous for his lectures. Americans call him one of the two great orators of modern times. (The other is the late President Roosevelt).</p>
<p>Among the 30,000 students at the main campus, 500 are Chinese students, most of whom are children of overseas Chinese, and less than 100 come from mainland China. There is a "Chinese College" on campus, which specializes in teaching Chinese reading and conversation. There are many American students, but the teaching progress is very slow. Other departments also have many courses on China and the East. A Chinese Dr. Ma teaches Chinese political philosophy and political thought. He has been teaching at the University of California for 15 years, starting as a teaching assistant and gradually progressing. Recently, he was promoted to professor. The University of California's library has a collection of one million volumes, making it one of the five largest libraries in the United States today. The architecture is similar to that of the Columbia University Library. The students' diligence in studying seems to be above that of Columbia University. Behind the library is a bell tower, each floor is named "Sather" in memory of the chief engineer Sather during the construction of the school building. On Sundays, the bell tower is open, and you can take an elevator to the top of the tower to overlook the entire bay.</p>
<p>The University of California's school buildings are built on the mountains, very similar to Wuhan University on Luojia Mountain in Wuchang and Zhijiang University on the Qiantang River in Hangzhou. However, the architecture is more exquisite than Wuhan University, and the scale is larger than Zhijiang University. The University of California's men's and women's gyms and swimming pools are built separately. On the high slopes, there is a secret research house for atomic bombs, and idle people are prohibited from entering.</p>
<p>When domestic students marched to protest against the Soviet Union's stationing of troops in the Northeast provinces, the Chinese Students Association of the University of California also held a response once. The school authorities strictly prohibit students from engaging in political activities, which is different from many other universities in the United States, especially from the various universities in New York.</p>

<h3>Poor Traffic Control: A Tragic Car Accident Occurs</h3>
<p>There is a tram every 20 minutes from Berkeley to San Francisco. The traffic in the entire San Francisco Bay Area is convenient. However, in the city, due to poor traffic control, tragic accidents of car crashes and pedestrian accidents often occur. There are still very few traffic lights in San Francisco, and the city is built on seven hills, which are so uneven. Many places are like Chongqing's "Qixinggang." When crossing the road, you have to be nervous.</p>
<p>The second day I arrived in San Francisco, a tragic tram crash occurred, killing one person and injuring fifteen others, including Chinese expatriates. Local newspapers published large photos and news, and there were also news of prosecutors "filing public suits" against the mayor, director of the transportation bureau, and the head of the automobile company.</p>
<p>This is not only a problem in San Francisco, but also a problem in the entire state of California. California is very lovable in every way, except for "racial discrimination" and unlovable traffic control. Last Christmas Eve, there were more than 90 car crashes and accidents across the United States, and California accounted for half of them.</p>
<p>However, the maritime traffic in San Francisco is safe. Between China and the United States, one ship comes and one ship goes, all using San Francisco as a hub. Recently, a ship called the "General MacArthur" came from China, carrying General Jiang Dingwen, Mr. Zou Bingwen, and many other inspectors and students. Customs inspections upon landing are very strict. Many acquaintances were only allowed to land after two days of inspection upon arrival.</p>
<h3>"China Expert" Montgomery</h3>
<p>Business relations are gradually becoming active due to the smooth flow of ships. San Francisco has undoubtedly become the center of Sino-American business. The person in charge of this key task is Mr. Montgomery, the head of the Sino-American Business Association, who is a "China expert" with goodwill towards China.</p>
<p>Because I was passing by in a hurry, I did not have time to talk with Mr. Montgomery in depth. However, listening to him talking to other friends, he has recently felt very pessimistic about trade with China. The reason for his pessimism is not the commonly used reasons such as "unstable currency value" and "inconvenient transportation," because these are expected phenomena during the transition period. What Mr. Montgomery feels most pained and indignant about is the mischief of some powerful bureaucratic capital in China. He said: "If this continues, legitimate merchants in both China and the United States will be tied hand and foot to await their doom. The powerful Chinese bureaucratic capital will strangle all economic ties!" I can understand: the inner indignation of the land. However, in any case, San Francisco is always moving in the direction of prosperity and development. Consul General Zhang Zichang said: San Francisco is China's granary. When China becomes strong, San Francisco will inevitably have its future! I miss my motherland, and I like San Francisco even more. Every dusk and night of lights, I often climb alone to the flower garden on the roof of the Hopkins Hotel to overlook this "comet" on the Pacific coast. On Sunday afternoon, Consul Wu Qianghua drove me to tour the entire peninsula. We galloped in Golden Gate Park and wandered along the cliffs of the coast. The waves of the Pacific Ocean alarmed the flocks of seabirds, which flew far, far away, to the other side of the earth that the eye cannot see! (The attached picture to the fifth article of the five-day, ten-thousand-mile journey across North America yesterday was "San Francisco Bay Bridge". This is hereby noted as a correction.)</p>

<h3>The Anatomy of Peace</h3>
<p>— Sun Hang</p>
<p>The Anatomy of Peace, by Emery Reves</p>
<p>"A Must-Read Book for Every American" -- The New York Times Review</p>
<p>Humanity has been crying out for peace for perhaps not a short period in history. After every tragic war, with many deaths, bloodshed, and sacrifices of property, humanity always says something to this effect: "Let's not fight again next time!"</p>
<p>But despite humanity's cries, wars have broken out one after another. After hundreds of battles, hundreds of lessons learned, and hundreds of cries, war still follows, so what is the reason for this?</p>
<p>Everyone knows that war is cruel and harmful, but when war breaks out, everyone goes all out. Every nation knows that war is a tragedy, a pain, yet everyone is constantly preparing for war. Why is this?</p>
<p>Many people with concern for the world have already thought about these questions, but their conclusions and methods have not produced the expected results. Take Wilson, for example, with his bodhisattva heart. He poured his heart and soul into creating a League of Nations, hoping to grow lasting peace from it, but unfortunately, the League of Nations died after contracting scarlet fever several times. Many peace advocates before him never had such insight, perseverance, and methods as Wilson, but Wilson also failed, which is such a chilling thing!</p>
<p>But the cruelty and sacrifices of the Second World War seem to have had an impact on the kind hearts of good people that is even greater than before. Some have forgotten Wilson and are now starting to remember him, some who turned their backs on Wilson are now turning back to face his direction, and some concerned people have carefully studied Wilson's path and opened up a different path that leads to the same destination as his. In short, more and more people are thinking about peace like Wilson.</p>
<p>Therefore, humanity may now be able to create a miracle and realize the peace they have been crying out for for many years. But for humanity to realize it, it must have a deep understanding of peace, must find out the reasons for the lack of peace, and then find ways to solve it. If humanity misperceives peace and misunderstands the reasons for the lack of peace, even with sincerity and perseverance, peace cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, before we strive for peace, it is really necessary to study peace.</p>
<p>Recently, I read "The Anatomy of Peace" by Emery Reves, and I feel that he has indeed found the crux of humanity's lack of peace. His descriptions and judgments fill me with admiration and respect. This thin book of less than three hundred pages may really be where our humanity's lasting peace lies!</p>
<p>Problem's Core: Narrow Nationalism</p>
<p>This book is divided into three volumes. Before the three volumes, there is also a preface entitled "The Copernican World". In this preface, the author cites historical facts from the past twenty-five years to explain the errors in modern national concepts.</p>
<p>There are no less than seventy or eighty countries standing in the world today, but they all have a common prejudice, believing that their own country is the center of the world. They observe the things of the world from the perspective of their own country, and they engage in various international activities based on the interests of their own country. Therefore, the same fact looks like this from one country's perspective and like that from another country's perspective. In this way, each country only thinks of itself, and true mutual understanding and tolerance become absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>This situation is very similar to the Ptolemaic theory in natural science. Ptolemy published his theory that the Earth is the center of the universe in the second century. According to his view, the Earth is a stationary center, and the sun, moon, and stars revolve around it. This theory was overturned by Copernicus only in the sixteenth century, but it had dominated for more than fourteen hundred years.</p>
<p>Our current view of the world and of the place of countries in the world is completely similar to Ptolemy's theory. Ptolemy's theory has been overturned, but our theory of the nation as the center of the world remains unshakable, which is such a mistake!</p>
<p>In the following three volumes, the author elaborates on this view as much as possible and uses various facts to prove his arguments.</p>
<p>In the first volume, the author criticizes capitalism, socialism, and religion. He believes that capitalism has completely failed, because the most central idea of capitalism is free enterprise and free trade. But in fact, in order to enhance their economic power, most countries have subjected free enterprise to the control of national authorities, and free trade has become a tool of the state due to the high tariff barriers and the worsening trade competition between countries. The experiment of socialism in the Soviet Union has also proved its failure. As the author says, "The Soviet Union is not developing towards democracy, but towards state control." Communism is no longer an end, it is merely a means, a means of moving towards nationalism. Religion is the same, it has lost its doctrine of universal brotherhood. Religious people pray for the glory of their motherland, and the concept of the nation has transcended their religious beliefs.</p>
<p>In this situation, many countries have moved towards fascism. Capitalism and socialism no longer have significant differences, they are both moving in the same direction, towards national supremacy.</p>
<p>War and Sovereignty: Need a Thorough Understanding</p>
<p>In the second volume, the author goes on to explain the meaning of war and sovereignty. He believes that war is inevitable when two groups each with absolute sovereignty exist in the same world without an organization above them that can limit them. For example, many wars in history were conflicts between tribes, or conflicts between dynasties, until these tribes or dynasties merged into a unified state, their disputes could be eliminated. Modern countries each have absolute sovereignty and can never be slightly restricted or abandoned, so war is of course inevitable. But as long as we have a government above the nation that can restrict national sovereignty and a common law to abide by, national disputes can be reduced like tribal or dynastic disputes.</p>
<p>But what should be the form of this government and this law? Is it like the League of Nations, or the United Nations organization?</p>
<p>In order to answer this question, the author criticizes the beliefs of the League of Nations and the United Nations—internationalism, national self-determination, and collective security—in the third volume.</p>
<p>The author believes that internationalism is incompetent and cowardly. Countries are on an equal footing, and even if they are bound by treaties, their competition remains the same. National self-determination has divided the world into more units. Moreover, true national self-determination is impossible to achieve in the current situation. For example, if the United States wants to determine its own fate, and Japan attacks Pearl Harbor, can it still determine its own fate? Can you say that all its decisions and policies are self-determined? Poland wants to determine its own fate, but when Germany threatens it and breaks down its door, can it still determine its own fate? Without a fair and powerful organization above the nation, national self-determination is impossible.</p>
<p>Collective security is the same. The author says, "Without collective sovereignty, collective security is meaningless." Any alliance, League of Nations, United Nations, or other organization is merely dividing the world into several sovereign units; desperately trying to maintain the existing state, it can never progress with the progress of the world.</p>
<p>In short, in this world, nationalism has dominated all democracy, socialism, liberalism, Christianity, capitalism, fascism, politics, religion, and economics. "Nationalism is soda water," the author says, "and when it is added to any beverage, it will make it fizz."</p>
<p>World Government: The Conclusion of Concerned People</p>
<p>Therefore, only by establishing a world government and formulating a world law to restrict the arbitrary and expansive actions of nations can world peace be hoped for.</p>
<p>Mr. Reves is a concerned person, he has found the cause of war for us and has opened up a plan for peace. People all over the world should read his book and study his views for the sake of peace.</p>
<p>After the book was published, twenty celebrities from the American academic community published an open letter for him, saying: "We hope that all Americans will read this book...." The New York Times review also said: "If ten or twenty million people read or discuss this anatomy of peace, it will definitely benefit the world." I also hope that not only Americans, but people all over the world can read this book; not only should they read it, but they should also be able to put his ideals into practice, then world peace can be expected in the near future.</p>
<h3>Review of "China's Wartime Politics"</h3>
<p>— Zhao Shichuan</p>
<p>Original title: China's Wartime Politics (1937-1944)</p>
<p>By Lawrence K. Rosinger, Princeton University Press, 1945</p>
<p>It is a very regrettable thing that Chinese people are generally not interested in Chinese politics. This can be proved by the fact that we have very few books on our own politics. Books like this are naturally not easy to write, especially in our environment, but our neglect of this aspect is undeniable.</p>
<p>This book is a book written by a foreigner about the political situation in China during the war, with a total of only one hundred and thirty-three pages. Unfortunately, more than half of it is occupied by relevant documents (such as the Prime Minister's will, the May Fifth Constitution Draft, and the important declarations of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party). It is of course impossible to write about China's eight-year War of Resistance in less than sixty pages. Therefore, as stated in the preface, this book only mentions a few important developments in the politics of free China.</p>
<p>The book is divided into three chapters. The first chapter is "Political Background", with a total of twenty-two pages, which is considered the longest. In addition to describing the different classes that make up Chinese society, this section also provides a concise description of the Kuomintang's revolutionary history and its relationship with the Communist Party. The second chapter is "Unification and Resistance", with a total of nineteen pages. This chapter mentions: the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the long-term war of resistance, Wang Jingwei's peace movement, and the Anhui Incident of the New Fourth Army in 1941 and its impact. The third chapter, "Chongqing and its Political Changes," is considered more important, but it is only seventeen pages long. The author discusses here: the personnel and organization of the wartime government, President Chiang, the Kuomintang, the Political Participation Council, the central government and the provinces, the constitutional movement, etc. Due to space limitations, these important topics are described very briefly, but they are not without pertinent points.</p>
<p>From the above outline, we can know that this book was not originally intended for Chinese readers. Its purpose is to give Westerners who are unfamiliar with Chinese politics a concept. It may occasionally allow readers to better understand the origins of the current complex political situation in China. If this book has any value, its value lies here.</p>
<h3>Introduction to a Soviet Children's Book "Stories of Lenin"</h3>
<p>— Xin Jun</p>
<p>[Originally written by M. Zoshchenko, translated by Cao Jinghua, first edition in Shanghai, January 1947]</p>
<p>Young people need to know about the life and achievements of a great man. In particular, middle school students will benefit more from reading this type of story book than from the popular myths and legends, and they can also gain a lot of knowledge.</p>
<p>This "Stories of Lenin" is very suitable for general middle school students to read. It simply depicts Lenin's life, and these stories are based on factual materials. The whole book includes twenty stories about Lenin, and each story expresses a characteristic of Lenin. The original author, Zoshchenko (M. Zoshchenko), is a famous Soviet writer who is very good at writing excellent children's stories. Because of his excellent creations, he was awarded a medal by the Presidium of the Soviet Union in January 1939. From this, it can be seen that his writing skills are very skilled.</p>
<p>The translator has a very good comment on this work: "Stories of Lenin can be said to be a new discovery in children's literature. It is not easy to narrate Lenin's life in simple language, in a relaxed and pleasant form of children's literature, in a simple and natural way." Indeed, the author's expression is very simple, but the content is very rich. The translator also said: "The portrayal of Lenin's character is exceptionally profound. Lenin's great image does not feel overwhelmed in these short stories." In this book, the two stories "The Bee" and "Stories of Lenin" are the most profoundly depicted. The remaining stories, such as: The Glass Bottle, How Lenin Learned, How Lenin Quit Smoking, Lenin's Clever Plan to Escape the Police, Buying Toys for a Little Child, In the Barber Shop, Lenin and the Stovemaker, Hunting, etc., are all described very concisely and clearly. The form of the text is very relaxed and beautiful. There are also five illustrations to help readers' interest.</p>
<p>As the translator said in the conclusion: "Not only do children find this work infinitely interesting, but adults are also very moved by it. Because there is not only the image of Lenin that children imagine in their hearts, but also the image that adults imagine in their hearts." Indeed, this book has this condition.</p>

<h3>Two or Three Things About Wen Tianxiang</h3>
<p>— Tan Zhengbi</p>
<p>Liu Yi, Liu Zhu, and Liu Mu</p>
<p>When Tianxiang was in exile, he changed his name to avoid the attention of the enemy. The records in various books are different. According to "Notes on Miscellaneous Poems of the Southern Clan":</p>
<p>Wen Tianxiang arrived in Zhenjiang and fled with his guests Du Hu and others at night. Tianxiang then changed his name to Liu Yi of Qingjiang and entered the seaside to the east.</p>
<p>But "Dongshan Tan Yuan" says: Wenshan traveled by sea from Huai to the border of Taizhou, and changed his name to Liu Zhu of Qingjiang, writing a poem for Zhang Zhezai of Huangyan County for the Green Ripple Hall. The two books are written as Liu Yi and Liu Zhu, respectively, and there are discrepancies. Therefore, "Compilation of Anecdotes of Song People" added an editor's note after citing these two notes: According to these two notes, one is written as Liu Yi and the other is written as Liu Zhu. It is suspected that the one written as "Yi" is just a slip of the pen. In fact, there is no need to suspect it. We can decide it by checking "Zhinan Lu". In "Zhinan Lu", there is indeed a poem for "Green Ripple Hall", and its preface says; I went to the shore of Taiwan by sea boat, to the Zhang family at the city gate, who were descendants of the famous general Yongde in the early days of the country. The host called himself Zhezai, and built a hall to teach his son, with the plaque "Green Ripple", and composed eight lines.</p>
<p>It does not mention the changing of the name here, but in the preface to the following poem "Passing Huangyan", it says: I went to Huai and changed my name, and when I reached the border of Tiantai, Zhang Zhezai (?), For me to find (?) Green Ripple poem. After I composed it, I wrote: Written by Liu Zhu of Qingjiang. This passes Huangyan, sending twenty characters.</p>
<p>It is known that "Jianshan Tan Yuan" was written according to this, but Zhang Zhezai was clearly a native of Taizhou, but he was referred to as Huangyan County, which was a temporary mistake by the author.</p>
<p>After reading the above textual research, it can be confirmed that Tianxiang changed his name to Liu Zhu of Qingjiang. But I don't know if Liu Zhu really existed, and was also a contemporary of Tianxiang, or even a fellow villager. Later, his whole family was martyred for the country. This is not a coincidence, but Tianxiang deliberately used the names of enthusiastic people as his own names. However, "Song History" does not record his name, only Liu Yueshen's "Biography of Chancellor Wen" mentions the name. If it were not for Deng Guangjian's "Biography of Loyalty of Chancellor Wen's Governor's Office", then such a patriotic man of lofty ideals who associated with Tianxiang would be buried and no one would know about him. The biography says:</p>
<p>Liu Zhu, whose name was Yuanbo, was a neighbor of the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister was good at elephant chess, Zhu, although not his opponent,</p>
<p>However, he pondered and forgot the day and night, his words were vulgar and low</p>
<p>, and he liked it because of this. Following the King's Service,</p>
<p>He was called Liu Military Supervisor, leading a single army, as</p>
<p>Supervising the Prime Minister's Guards. He was flexible and responsive,</p>
<p>Answering tirelessly. When he suddenly fell ill, the defeat of the empty</p>
<p>Pit, he was arrested and taken to Longxing, and was harmed on the same day as his eldest</p>
<p>Son. The second son died in the chaos,</p>
<p>The youngest son died in Guang.</p>
<p>If the soldiers of a country were all like this, how could the country be destroyed? But like this kind of patriotic man of lofty ideals, after sacrificing their lives for the country, their names are buried and not known to the public. From ancient times to the present, I don't know how many there have been. Even in this national crisis, there are many who were once reported in newspapers at the time, but are now forgotten by everyone. There are even more that are unknown to people. Therefore, the recognition of loyalty and righteousness should be considered a major event by the country, otherwise, it will not only fail to honor the dead in the past, but it will also be difficult to encourage the living in the future.</p>
<p>But this Liu Mu, in the "Wenshan Collection", is written as Liu Zhu. The preface to "Collection of Du Poems" "Liu Mu One Hundred and Twentieth" in Volume 16 of the "Wenshan Collection" says:</p>
<p>Propagating Lang, Secretary of the Governor's Office, Acting Secretary of the Great Government</p>
<p>Temple, Liu Mu, whose name is Yuanbo, is my friend and neighbor. I followed</p>
<p>The King's Service to become an official. I</p>
<p>Was captured, and Boyuan led the armies back. When I</p>
<p>Returned to the country, Yuanbo gathered his troops and went to the governor's office,</p>
<p>Meeting in Ting, he was in charge of a single army, as</p>
<p>Supervising the Prime Minister's Guards. He was serious and resourceful,</p>
<p>Flexible and responsive. All the loyal and righteous people of Jiangxi, Boyuan</p>
<p>Was the one who summoned them, responding day and night, tireless in energy.……</p>
<p>Is it Liu Mu or Liu Zhu? This may be due to different versions of each book. But if it is certified that the "Biography of Loyalty of Chancellor Wen's Governor's Office" is Liu Zhu, which is a temporary error by the author, then why is Liu Yueshen's "Biography of Wen Tianxiang" also written as Liu Zhu? Therefore, the only way to solve this problem is to not solve it.</p>
<p>Here, I must also mention Zhang Zhezai, for whom Tianxiang wrote a poem, to see what kind of person he was. His deeds can also be found in the "Biography of Loyalty of Chancellor Wen's Governor's Office". The biography says:</p>
<p>Zhang Zhezai was a hero on the sea in Taizhou,</p>
<p>He lived in Chengguan Town, and was a descendant of the famous general Yongde in the early days of the country.</p>
<p>When the Prime Minister traveled by sea from Tongzhou and passed Chengguan, Zhezai extended his welcome</p>
<p>And made an agreement to start an uprising. Zhang happily gathered sea</p>
<p>Ships and sent a message to the sea, and the heroes obeyed.</p>
<p>When the Prime Minister arrived at Fuan, he asked to take</p>
<p>Mingzhou himself, but was stopped by Chen Yizhong and Zhang Shijie.</p>
<p>Zhang also stopped due to loss of news. After</p>
<p>Two years, Zhang Hongfan marched south and saw the notice</p>
<p>On the walls, he told the boatmen that he had a</p>
<p>Gap with him, and reported the arrest to the front of the army. Zhezai knew</p>
<p>That he could not avoid it, and said to Hongfan: I was born as</p>
<p>A Song minister, and I will die as a Song ghost, why are you surprised that</p>
<p>I am doing this! Hongfan killed his father and son and destroyed his</p>
<p>Home.</p>
<p>It turned out that he was also a respectable and admirable hero with unyielding integrity, no wonder Tianxiang never forgot him.</p>
<h3>Bird Flying to the Top of Lilac (Photography)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yinquan</p>
<p>Fun Facts about Writers</p>
<h3>Wordsworth</h3>
<p>— Shen Si</p>
<p>The great English poet Wordsworth (Willam Wordsworth 1770-1850) was an extremely optimistic person. He also liked to exaggerate and praise himself. Once, the American poet and critic Emerson visited him, and the great poet desperately praised his own poems, and he looked down on others at all. Once, he wrote a letter to the Scottish poet Macky (Charles Macky 1814-1889) saying that he had never read his poems and did not want to read them once.</p>
<h3>Shakespeare in the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>In the sixties of the previous century, all of Shakespeare's works had been translated into Russian, and several had even been retranslated several times. At the beginning of the new century, Russia's interest in Shakespeare declined slightly, but it gradually prospered again during the Soviet era. At that time, there were Marshak's magical sonnet translations, as well as dramatic translations by Pasternak, Levik, and Tatyana Shchepkina-Kupernik.</p>
<p>Now there are many Russian translations of Shakespeare, for example, Hamlet has at least thirty-six translations.</p>
<p>The best translation in Soviet Russia is that of Ameyani. The first Shakespeare translation was a hundred years ago, and Masyyan's translation has become an important classic of Armenia.</p>
<p>To judge the quality of a translation, it is impossible to criticize it if you do not understand the translation. But the excellence of Masyan's translation has been almost unanimously praised by authoritative Armenian scholars, actors, writers, and poets, and this is indeed a fact.</p>
<p>New Armenian translations continue to be published. Now "Hamlet" has seven translations, "Othello" and "Julius Caesar" have six each, "Macbeth" and "The Merchant of Venice" have five each, and "King Lear" and "Romeo and Juliet" have three each. In addition, there are many translations of dramas.</p>
<p>The most famous old Georgian translation is that of Machabeli. The famous Georgian actor Khorava played Othello using Machabeli's translation. Now many new Georgian translations have also been published.</p>
<p>The earliest Azerbaijani translation was that of Djafar Djabarly, and he also translated it best. He was a famous national writer who passed away ten years ago, and the Baku Theater Museum uses his name to commemorate him. He wrote the script "Bride of the Flames", which is extremely popular in Azerbaijan. He translated Othello in Everan, where Othello was played by a young Azerbaijani actor Ali Zeinand. Macbeth has also been translated into Azerbaijani. Recently, Mirza Ibashlmov translated "Twelfth Night".</p>
<p>The Caucasus has also translated a lot of Shakespeare. For example, some have been translated into Oesetian. Not long ago, Othello was also performed in Kuumyk, the capital of Daghestan. But such translations are rarely printed into books, because they are specifically for the stage.</p>
<p>Before the Russian Revolution, Uzbekistan had almost no theaters, but now there are famous actors who perform Othello and Hamlet. Shakespeare is extremely popular among Uzbeks. Uzbeks have a tradition of wit and often talk and laugh in teahouses, so they are very receptive to Shakespeare's wit. Each language often uses different methods to express the wit of Shakespeare's language. Not long ago, the Uzbek version of Romeo and Juliet was staged. The most interesting thing is that these Shakespeare translations were the first to introduce free verse to the Uzbek poetry world.</p>
<p>The first Cirghiz theater was newly built during the war. This theater opened with "King Lear". The translator translated from the English original and then compared it with the Russian version. This method was widely adopted.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian writer Ivan Franko., the Kiev theater is named after him, and he also praised Shakespeare, and has eleven articles discussing Shakespeare. The most popular Shakespeare play in Ukraine today is Mnch Ado About Nothing, and the actress is the famous actress of the film "Rainbow" Natalia Uzhvy.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many other Soviet countries that translate Shakespeare, with a total of twenty-seven languages.</p>
<h3>Lamp</h3>
<p>— Huai Zong</p>
<p>It is a bleak winter night. The north wind outside the door is blowing fiercely. Occasionally, the slight footsteps of one or two pedestrians, from far to near, then from near to far, gradually disappear into the cold wind like a wisp of light smoke. It is a deathly silent winter night!</p>
<p>Every night, I sit alone in front of the kerosene lamp, doing my work. In this desolate suburban room, only this lonely lamp keeps me company. Every night, it stretches out its clear, red tongue of fire, emitting endless, pure light, and I am deeply immersed in this light of a yellow tint. This light has a unique softness and beauty, like milky white light gauze, or like the mist at dawn. I often fall leisurely into the abyss of fantasy.</p>
<p>Don't underestimate this tiny lamp! Although it does not have an outstanding posture or colorful decorations, it brings me lovely light and a pleasant feeling. It drives away the terrifying darkness for me, and it warms my lonely traveler's heart. It makes me feel warm all over, and it makes my blood flow like waves. Moreover, in its light, many masterpieces and great works have leaped into my eyes. It indirectly replenishes my spiritual food and provides sustenance for my spirit. Ah! Great lamp!</p>
<p>The lamp is indeed great. It can conquer the stubborn darkness, making all demons and monsters unable to hide. It ruthlessly reveals the true face of all things. Moreover, it is also kind and loving. It generously gives lovely light to everyone, unless that person is unwilling to accept its sincere gift.</p>
<p>The north wind comes in through the crack in the door, and the lamp goes out. Darkness sneaks in again. I feel like I've fallen into a cellar, and fear strikes my heartstrings. I hurriedly use a match to save its life. It is filled with vitality again, flashing dazzling light, smiling as if to thank me. The life of a lamp is eternal, isn't it? No matter spring, summer, autumn, or winter, and on nights of wind, frost, rain, or snow, can't traces of lamps be found everywhere?</p>
<p>Under the clear lamplight every night, I have gained great enlightenment. In the lamplight, I understand the true meaning of life.</p>
<p>Therefore, with a lamp, my life is full of vitality. With a lamp, I don't feel empty or lonely. I don't want to listen to jarring music, and I don't want to watch intoxicating singing and dancing, but I want to be forever intoxicated in this quiet and peaceful lamplight.</p>
<h3>Commemorating the Pig Year and Expressing Sentiments Through Objects</h3>
<p>— Lu Qingying</p>
<p>In the year of the pig, I try writing in red ink, borrowing you to express my feelings. A dark-faced official comes from overseas (Note 1), a white-haired shepherd boasts in Liaodong (Note 2). One should teach children to be trustworthy, like Mencius (Note 3), cutting grass and calling oneself king is merely self-aggrandizement (Note 4). I fear hearing Wujin disturb the black market (Note 5), the taste of chaff is endlessly delightful (Note 6).</p>
<p>[Note 1] During the peaceful era, people in Guilin were known to enjoy eating frogs. Some who came to the central court as officials were mocked for eating frogs. They replied, "Isn't sitting with worms better than being a dark-faced official?" The dark-faced official refers to a pig. [Note 2] In the Later Han Dynasty, there was a white-haired pig in Liaodong. The shepherd found it unusual and offered it as a tribute. When he reached Hedong and saw that all the pigs were white, he was ashamed and retreated.</p>
<p>[Note 3] In Han Shi Wai Zhuan, when Mencius was young, he asked his neighbor why they were slaughtering a pig. His mother lied to him, saying it was to feed him. Later, she regretted her words and bought meat from the market to feed him to show her trustworthiness.</p>
<p>[Note 4] In the History of the Southern Dynasties, Emperor Ming of the Song Dynasty was obese and was nicknamed "Pig King."</p>
<p>[Note 5] In Chaoye Qianzai, a man in Hongzhou became rich by raising pigs, and pigs were referred to as "Wujin" (black gold).</p>
<p>[Note 6] In Qing Yi Lu, Chen Qiao of the Tang Dynasty ate steamed dumplings and said, "The flavor of chaff is not shallow."</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood 167</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"If we can present the problem, we can all find a reasonable solution, unite as one, and do what needs to be done. Personally, I have no problem; as long as it doesn't hinder the grand plan, I will definitely take the lead." The "grand plan" that Tsurumi speaks of, of course, refers to his own scheme.</p>
<p>Yaoqun, Little Tiger, and I did not speak.</p>
<p>"Very good," Mr. M admired Tsurumi's frankness, "The grand plan absolutely cannot be hindered. This is the only hope we share, and we certainly cannot sacrifice it. ... What exactly is going on?" Mr. M asked himself, as an opening for the question.</p>
<p>"Our organization," Mr. M continued, "has always been very secret. The concealment has been very clever. But since 9 o'clock last night until now, the situation seems to be a little bad."...</p>
<p>"Nine o'clock?" Tsurumi asked, "That was an hour after I arrived here?"</p>
<p>"That's right." Mr. M nodded, "According to the report from the headquarters, in the past twenty-plus hours, someone has been walking past this door every three or four hours. Of course, they can distinguish between ordinary people and secret agents."</p>
<p>"No trailing?" I interjected. At the same time, Yaoqun seemed to have the same question. Little Tiger, however, sneered at it.</p>
<p>"Yes, there was." Mr. M answered affirmatively, "Around 11 o'clock last night, there was a very obvious incident. One of our comrades followed him. He traced him all the way to an apartment in Dongjiaomin Lane. This apartment is diagonally opposite us here, and it also has four floors..."</p>
<p>"Miss Yao, what is your opinion?" Tsurumi specifically asked Yaoqun.</p>
<p>"It's a pity that Little Tiger and I discovered it a little too late, and it slipped away! It only happened an hour ago, and there wasn't enough time to report it."</p>
<p>"Oh? ... What kind of person? One person or several?" Tsurumi asked Little Tiger again.</p>
<p>"Of course, there was only one person." Little Tiger replied, "It's a pity it was a woman, otherwise..."</p>
<p>"What? A woman?" Tsurumi was alarmed.</p>
<p>"No, it should be said, Tiger," Yaoqun lectured Tiger Chen again, "It should be said that the suspicious person we encountered was only one, and she was a very beautiful woman."</p>
<p>"That's right," Mr. M agreed with Tsurumi's question, "There was only one person, and it was indeed a woman. The lookout post on the roof reported that she was also constantly using binoculars on the roof of that apartment. She has good energy; she hasn't rested much in a day and a night."</p>
<p>"Miss Yao, please describe her appearance, maybe I can..."</p>
<p>Yaoqun interrupted Tsurumi before he could finish speaking; "It was just a fleeting glance, I didn't see clearly; about five feet two inches tall: very slender waist, seems to have martial arts skills, and moves very lightly."</p>
<p>"Does she have the characteristics of a Japanese woman?" Tsurumi frowned.</p>
<p>"No, I have seen many Japanese women in Northeast China wearing Chinese clothes, and I can point them out at a glance; because their feet must be short and flat, and when they walk, their toes are turned inward. Even if they are burned to ashes, I can still recognize them..."</p>
<p>"That's not necessarily true," Mr. M also interjected. "Miss Ji, women over twenty years old can be identified in this way, but those under twenty cannot be confirmed."</p>
<p>"That's right," Yaoqun smiled, "It's precisely because she is over twenty."</p>

<p>Ancient Ferry</p>
<p>The river here</p>
<p>Is like the river in my hometown</p>
<p>Wrapped in a slanting sunset</p>
<p>Appearing a bit desolate</p>
<p>Tonight</p>
<p>The autumn wind blows reeds on the shore</p>
<p>The heart longing for home flies with the white clouds</p>
<p>Far, far away</p>
<p>Across the river comes a drunk</p>
<p>Person returning home</p>
<p>Dawn</p>
<p>Walking toward the wilderness</p>
<p>The night is hazy</p>
<p>I put on a body of dew</p>
<p>Searching, searching for that lost star</p>
<p>In my dream</p>
<p>Has it bloomed on the earth</p>
<p>In the hazy night</p>
<p>In the east</p>
<p>The sun gives me a brilliant</p>

<p>Friend,</p>
<p>Are you still proud?</p>

<p>Relying on your people</p>

<h3>Europe is Also Suffering Tens of Millions are Enduring Hunger and Cold</h3>
<p>— Zuo</p>
<p>The situation in England today is worse than during the war. Not only England, but the entire Europe is in the same situation.</p>
<p>Tens of millions of people are enduring the suffering of hunger and cold after the war and are now entering their third week. The resources available to ordinary people today are scarcer than during the war. Only unnatural and sudden deaths are reduced—but sometimes people fear a miserable life even more.</p>
<p>Terrible Storms</p>
<p>Terrible storms have struck throughout England, hindering the transport of coal, the lifeline of industrial economy. Most factories are cut off from electricity, and electricity use in most homes is also restricted.</p>
<p>The British Labor government is facing a brewing first-class political crisis. The war has deprived Britain of its ability to materially overcome this frigid climate, because Britain has been living "hand to mouth" for seven years.</p>
<p>Cold Homes</p>
<p>Two million unemployed workers will return to their cold homes, huddled around stoves burning the last few pieces of rationed coal, eating their limited rationed food.</p>
<p>From 9:00 a.m. to noon, and from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., the electricity in London homes is completely cut off. Countless mothers and their babies living in apartments using electric stoves and ovens will fall into a tragic situation.</p>
<p>At the same time, throughout Europe, where cultural standards and material enjoyment are higher than elsewhere, we see such a bleak scene:</p>
<p>Italy has been without electricity for a long time due to the coal shortage. Torrential rains and melting snow have caused disasters, displacing people and forcing the government to take emergency relief measures.</p>
<p>The World's Paradise is Completely Different</p>
<p>Switzerland, a small country, is situated in a continent filled with devastation, like a flourishing paradise, but it cannot avoid the same suffering. Shop windows are not allowed to light electric lights, and restaurants and bars reduce electricity by one-third. Due to the reduction of water in the reservoirs of power stations, the electricity used by various industries is reduced.</p>
<p>Forty-eight people froze to death in Hamburg, Germany, in a recent day. Due to the severe coal shortage, all electricity may soon be cut off.</p>
<p>In Austria, electricity is cut off for six hours a day in households.</p>
<p>The situation in Belgium seems to be about the same as before the war, but Italian workers have moved in to work in the mines. The supply of gas and electricity in the Netherlands has recently been reduced significantly.</p>
<p>In France, in the past few days, the lights in shop windows and other advertising lights have been prohibited, and the amount of electricity used nationwide is decreasing day by day.</p>
<h3>Blessed Land?</h3>
<p>— Fang Wen</p>
<p>Some say: "The hearts of Shanghai people are too bad. The rich live in extravagance and waste on weekdays, and their sins are heavy. Therefore, Shanghai will suffer a great calamity."</p>
<p>Some say: "Most Shanghai people respect gods and believe in Buddha. On the first and fifteenth of each month, every family burns long ingots. The Ullambana Festival and Vajra Dharma Assemblies are endless. Their merits are immeasurable, so Shanghai is truly a place to eliminate disasters and receive blessings."</p>
<p>We all still remember that as soon as the Sino-Japanese War began, Zhabei was reduced to ashes, and the Qijiang Road Huishan Wharf staged several earth-shattering and god-weeping street battles. When the national army withdrew westward, the city became scorched earth. Finally, all of Shanghai fell into enemy hands. It cannot be said that Shanghai did not suffer a great calamity. A few days before the victory, the bombing and landing were so intense that there was no time to breathe. Fortunately, two atomic bombs quickly frightened the Japanese invaders into surrendering. Shanghai was able to turn danger into safety at a critical moment. After all, Shanghai is a blessed land!</p>
<p>But, please see what the current situation is like.</p>
<h3>Thoughts Inspired by Filming the "Stealing the Treasury" On Location</h3>
<p>— Jian Hua</p>
<p>This newspaper reported that Columbia Pictures is filming "Stealing the Treasury" on location, and will be taking footage of the Bund, Nanjing Road, Nanshi, Longhua Airport, and the City God Temple, and the Bao'an Sidu Temple in this city. "Stealing the Treasury" is a detective film starring Dick Powell, using Washington, San Francisco, Shanghai, Cairo and other places as backgrounds. In order to make the facts convincing, the company traveled all the way across the ocean to Shanghai to film on location. Their serious production and abundant funds are admirable. It is said that the film began shooting in Hollywood on December 8 last year, and is scheduled to be completed by the end of June. It will be shipped to Shanghai for release in the second half of this year. I think at that time, the men and women of Shanghai will definitely rush to see the local scenery in the foreign film.</p>
<p>However, the City God Temple and Bao'an Sidu Temple in this city have too strong of a superstitious atmosphere. There are old ladies with small feet, and old men with pigtails. There are unsightly fortune-telling and god-seeking activities, and all kinds of beggars in extremely poor conditions. If these are captured on camera, it is not promoting our historical sites, but exposing our ugliness. I hope that the people on our side who are assisting in the filming will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>I personally saw three foreigners in Minhang Town, west of Shanghai, taking pictures of beggars catching lice in the sun and naked, crazy doctors (selling plaster leaves). Their filming seems to always choose such bad subjects. I don't know what the purpose is. In the future, with the bright spring and the roads open to various towns, foreigners' footsteps will inevitably increase. We only hope that in addition to observing customs, they will make sincere suggestions and not joke around and take pictures of a dark and ugly side.</p>
<p>I've said too much and I’m digressing too much, which will cause misunderstandings. Of course, Columbia Pictures' filming on location in this city is different from photography that is specifically looking for jokes, and "Stealing the Treasury" is based on the theme of international cooperation in drug prohibition. The film may be of great help to our country's anti-drug future. We are optimistic about its success and wait and see when the film is released.</p>

<h3>Yangjingbang Excerpts</h3>
<p>One day, at a movie theater, after the last show had started, a foreigner came to buy a ticket. The ticket seller didn't know whether he was buying for the current show or for the next day, because he didn't understand English, but the foreigner didn't know Chinese either, so someone next to them acted as a translator. He asked the foreigner: "Want seep Not seep Want see inside seei not see, to-morrow see, to-,prrpw see.sa,e see"</p>
<p>What he meant was:</p>
<p>"Do you want to see it? If you want to see it, please go in; if you don't want to see it, come back tomorrow, tomorrow will be the same (no change of film)."</p>
<p>But as a result, the foreigner was confused. (Di Sheng) Writer</p>

<p>Answers: "Lang Xin Ru Tie" (A Heart of Iron), "Yu Tang Fu Gui" (Wealth and Rank).</p>
<h3>Spring Morning Window (3)</h3>
<p>— Yifan</p>
<p>The Beginning of Worry</p>
<p>"The beginning of worry is when one learns to read," it is better not to learn to read.</p>
<p>It seems to be a novel by Gide, writing about a girl who was blind from birth, loved to listen to pastoral symphonies, and imagined the world as very beautiful in her dark world. Later, she suddenly saw the light, opened her eyes and saw that the world was completely different from what she had imagined, and she was greatly disappointed and extremely painful.</p>
<p>This is the beginning of worry when life opens its eyes, it is better to remain blind.</p>
<p>Also Looking</p>
<p>A teenager named Wang Dawei from the Hongqiao School for the Blind lost his sight at the age of three, and has been blind for fifteen years. An Austrian doctor, Professor Fuchs, cured him.</p>
<p>I don't know how Mr. Wang imagined the world in fifteen years. I also don't know what comparisons he has made now.</p>
<p>But, in any case, now he is also watching this world with us. True Algorithm</p>
<p>A person who earns 500,000 yuan a month could originally buy one tael of gold and have some left over. In recent days, the price of gold has been rising, and the salary has been greatly reduced. They can only buy a little more than five qian, which is exactly half.</p>
<p>I don't know how many people have been harmed by this wrong algorithm.</p>
<p>The correct algorithm should be like this: Originally, your salary could only buy five qian of gold, and a few days ago you earned a tael (everyone has this luck), and now it belongs to you, you have not lost anything. Use Deduction</p>
<p>Understanding a little bit of deduction will make you understand the application of this algorithm.</p>
<p>If the price of gold continues to rise, and you still apply the wrong algorithm, of course you will find that your salary has become a discount of 10% or 20%, leaving only one or two qian of gold.</p>
<p>It should be like this: Your salary was originally only one or two qian of gold, but think about the one tael you earned a few days ago, aren't you happy?</p>
<p>Yellow Not Calamity</p>
<p>"Yellow Peril", how to explore? Is gold causing trouble? That's right, people are really dying these days.</p>
<p>But I have never seen a rifle thrown in the corner of a wall suddenly float in the air and kill someone.</p>
<p>Many people die on the battlefield, which is also considered a disaster, right? But have you ever heard of: This is a gun disaster, a cannon disaster, a bomb disaster, and a bayonet disaster?</p>
<p>"Yellow Peril." - No reason.</p>
<p>Earning Extra Money</p>
<p>In the United States, a 71-year-old great-grandmother went to school to learn how to fly a plane. Just in time.</p>
<p>This is quite worthy of promotion in China. I think a law should also be signed: No one under the age of seventy may ride an airplane.</p>
<p>"It is rare to live to seventy since ancient times," the age after seventy is originally extra money. Journalism</p>
<p>Tycoons who have always trusted the government still eat a lot of gold; needless to say, the Communist troops who have never trusted the government.</p>
<p>The Communist army buying gold is not news. Tycoons eating gold is news.</p>
<p>Just like: A dog biting a person is not news, a person biting a dog is news.</p>
<p>Calculating Profit and Loss</p>
<p>When the US dollar fell from 20,000 yuan to 17,000 yuan, a friend bought 500 yuan. He earned 1.5 million legal currency.</p>
<p>When the US dollar fell from 17,000 yuan to 15,000 yuan, he sold it again. He lost 1 million.</p>
<p>He earned more and lost less. - My algorithm.</p>
