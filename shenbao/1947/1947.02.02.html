<h3>吳鐵城返京</h3>
<p>對中共拒和深表遺憾</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕吳秘書長鐵城，前因健康關係，請假來滬，將於今日返京銷假。中央社記者特走謁於海格路私邸，當蒙延見，吳氏神氣凝靜，稍形淸　，握手互道春禧後，即謂：「十五年來，未得一日休息，此次到上海檢查身體，藉便休息，忽忽匝月，深自快慰」。記者即陳述若干近事，並叩詢意見，談及國內政局，吳氏僅謂：「中共拒絕和談，當不惟余個人引爲遺憾，且必爲國內外所同深失望。今美國宣布放棄調處工作，則爲當然之後果，不必視爲意外」云。談及憲法憲政，吳氏謂：「憲法旣經頒布，憲政即將實施，但願全國上下，同心協力，庶幾憲政之質施如期完成，凡此有關立法程序者，政府負其重責，必可逐步　事，但一般社會對於憲政之熱情，尚嫌不够，余嘗加以研析，發見原因甚多，或在上，或在下，其間有一點相習成風，習焉不察，而其實甚關重要者，即有些官員乃至於警察保甲，忘其爲人民公僕身份，爲人民服務，儼若統治者自居，而以人民為被統治之階層，間接造成民問對於官衙之厭惡，因此而凡百政令，一出官衙，人民漠然，更遑論同心協力責求實效，吾人必須補救此一病態，根除此種錯誤觀念，然後憲政民主，自得一番新氣象矣。蔣主席屢屢誥誠百官，必須勸政愛民，守法負責。又謖官吏必須善盡保姆之職責，此是從政者所應體認踐履之態度」。又談及飛機失事問題，吳氏謂，「匝月以來，犧牲者逾百人，故舊罹難者已數人，並認此爲航空事業之大不幸，惟失事後之救護工作，則不能不指爲效率太差。蓋因航空公司與有關救護機關救護之緩慢疏忽，輕傷變重重傷不速救而致死，即如王弟弟在失事的第二天，始被發見，小性命未爲不及救護所斷送，眞是神靈默佑，惟有感謝上蒼」。至遭難乘客在呻吟之中，或身死之後，再這剝衣之搜刧，則「不能不爲世道人心悲」。最後談及舊曆新正之習俗難除，吳秘書長稍展愁眉，調：「又達新春，在中國傳統的情緒上，第覺一年之計，在於春，新春常帶來靑春，帶來無窮希望，帶來新生命，此一情緒，亦成爲社曾每年春節有力之鼓勵，祗要國人善爲接受此鼓勵，同時顧及國步之艱難，建國這重責大任，此一代相戒，以勿再自私自利，次一代相勗以刻苦耐勞，有作有爲，為國家民族奠定穩固基礎，共同努力三十年，庶幾第三代有其富强康樂之善果矣」。</p>

<h3>民盟招待各界</h3>
<p>希望各界參加盟員</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕一日下午二時，民盟假靑年會招待本市工商文化界，張瀾主席，出席者二百人以上。張東蓀報告時，强調民盟之獨立性與中問性，並希望各界人士參加，以實現「眞正而廣大」之民主。記者於會後訪晤民盟某要員，詢問民盟之擴大組織及工作方針，據云：民盟兩年前之盟員，大多爲敎育文化界人士，目前則公務人員及工商界參加者已不少，今後盟員之吸收，廣及各界，惟民盟不擁軍隊，故軍人入盟者殊少。至於今後之工作方針，除健全內部增强力量外隨時不放棄調解之機會。惟有鑒過去屢次失敗，以致信用喪失起見，以後非有把握，不致　動。</p>
<h3>普利查德　罪行成立</h3>

<h3>主席宴政府要員　對時局交換意見</h3>
<p>民社黨尙未提出改組政府辦法</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕蔣主席一日下午七時半在官邸召宴政府要員王寵惠，邵力子，孫科，張治中，張厲生，于右任，戴傳賢，陳立夫等，席間就改組政府暨憲政實施程序中之各項法規，如各項選舉法等，廣泛交換意見。關於改組政府，目前已在積極進行中，吳鐵城，雷震等，均尚在滬，爲此事奔走，談話至九時許始散。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨對改組政府之具體辦法迄未提出，一日未舉行會議，但私人間有意見交換。據某要員稱：如下星期一不舉行會議，則此事將在星期三例會上提出討論。目前成問題者非原則而爲枝節，民社黨終希望參加政府後能發生相當作用，而非以做官了事。預料此事不致拖延過久，外傳須延至外長會議後提出之說，完全不確。</p>
<h3>去年聖誕節飛機失事案　參政會調查報吿全文　分析責任問題提出改進意見</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕參政會駐會委會，前推派江庸，鄭揆一，尹述賢三氏赴滬，調查去年十二月廿五日上海飛機失事案眞相，經於一月八日先後抵滬，業經調查完畢，並將調查結果，於卅一日該會第十四次會議中提出書面報告，當經決議送請政府採擇辦理。查該次航機失事，全國矚目，參政會之調查，自爲各方所重視，該報告全文中，首段詳叙自一月八日至十五日在滬調查經過，旋乃依次提出：（一）失事眞相，（二）責任問題，（三）改進意見三項，茲將該報吿有關此三項之全文，錄誌如次：</p>
<p>失事眞相</p>
<p>（一）一四〇號機係C四七式，由重慶來，經停漢口，再起飛，經南京飛上海。一一五號機係C四六式，由重慶來，經停漢口，再起飛直飛上海，四八號機係C一式，廿五日午八時四十分由重慶起飛，十二時十五分到漢，一時十分由漢續飛，三時到達南京，三時廿五分續飛上海。（二）各機起飛後，據中航氣象預測，上海南京均相同，即自上午十一時至下午五時，雲高爲二千尺至一千尺，或下降至五百尺，能見度爲一英里至半英里。照例飛行之起飛降落，在雲高三百尺，能見度一英里即可起降，逾此則關閉機塲，是日一四〇號機，飛抵南京時，爲四時卅八分，一一五號飛抵南京時爲四時二分，四八號機飛抵南京爲三時廿分，除四入號機經過南京天氣正常，一一五號機經過南京天氣在變，且屬直飛上海，均可飛滬外，一四〇號機飛抵南京，則天氣已劣，曾試圖降洛不果，仍直飛上海，有至一四〇號機飛抵上海市空，爲六時四十分，一一五號機飛抵上海，爲五時十分，四八號機飛抵上海市空，爲五時四十分，天氣均已轉劣，蓋上海機塲，已於四時卅分關閉也。當一四〇號機飛抵南京時，曾於四時電知上海公司請示，是否可以飛滬降落，四時十七分得復，天黑後不宜飛滬。又五時十分曾令其飛高七千五百公尺，而一一五號機除三時卅五分與龍華電報聯絡外，以後未見電報聯絡，至四八號機則因天氣正常，循例飛滬。（三）一一五號與一四〇號機，據中國航空公司機航組長伍慈報告，該兩機均得江灣指揮台許可，始往龍華降落，除一四〇號機汽油不足，　飛龍華機塲三刻鐘，盲目强迫降落，於七時五十四分墜毀於龍華機塲跑道岔道外，一一五號機，則繞上海市空約有四個鐘頭之多，始盲目强迫降落，於九時二十九分墜毀於龍華機塲南一英里之地。至四八號機，則經江灣指揮台許可准用雷降落，於八時另分墜毀於江灣機塲外一英里之張姓屋下，（四）一四〇號機，共載乘客二十七人，空勤人員三人，該機墜毀後，計死乘客二十二人，空勤人員三人，餘乘客五人，尚在中山醫院療養中。一一五號機，共載乘客三十八人，空勤人員三人，該機墜毀後，共死乘客三十二人，空勤人員二人，未受傷者一人，尚在中山醫院者七人，四八號機共載乘客七人，空勤人員四人、共十一人，人機俱設。</p>
<p>責任問題</p>
<p>經查交通部航政　李司長，曾允將此次飛機失事調查情形，全部送會參考，復查交通部民航局長戴安國，亦允將此次飛機失事之調查報告，另錄一份送會參考，乃至今旬餘，猶未送來，此中內幕殊屬費解。茲就同人等親與調查所得，對於責任方面，提供意見四點，以備商討：</p>
<p>我國成立民用航空公司以來，各方人士，即噴有煩書，綜其要點，不外空勤人員走私舞弊，玩忽職守，態度驕傲，以致隨時發生偷油，過重，聯絡不靈，管理不常情事。綜觀兩公司對此次事件及調查之應付，中央航空公司責任似覺較輕，中國航空公司責任似覺較重，蓋中央四八號機，係在江灣失事，如有責任，除機師本身外，應屬美軍控制之江灣機塲人員，且該公司對於大小問題，似均較嚴切注意，如上海天氣突變，則於四時十分即命四六號與四三號機停飛上海，如李代表東原所述靑島地下人員玩忽職務問題，即於三日內查明具報，反之，中國航空公司，於該日下午四時後，並未令各機停航，雖其報告中，載有能華電台似可停飛之電報，但其不能作肯定之指示，則屬事實，而關於李代表東原所述靑烏地下人員玩忽職務一件，則至今置而未復，再加以同人等詢及死難人員時，自總經理以下，言詞均較支吾，足證中國航空公司人員，平素修養均欠謹慎，辦事方面，亦欠週到，故此次失事責任，中國航空公司當局，不無可議之處，此其一。</p>
<p>氣象預測，爲飛航人員最要之指南針，乃該日氣象站之氣象預測，均爲上午十一時至下午五時，皆在飛行起降限度以上，惟至四時以後，不獨上海天氣轉劣，即南京天氣，亦爲突變，故此次失事責任，氣象人員，應分其責，否則氣象設備不周，氣象測候員，不敷應用，交通部與中國航空公司亦不應辭其咎，此其二。</p>
<p>機塲之設備完備與否，直接影響於飛行着落之安全，龍華機塲凹凸不平，夷爲水塘，公司當局在平時不早爲舖蓋沙土，而出事之後，則推諉於經濟困難，是一四〇號飛機之觸岔道而殞滅，或亦機塲不平有以致之，則事屬可能。至於四周建築之為障碍，究非此次之眞因也，此其三。</p>
<p>此次善後處置，兩公司均尚能體念周到，惟公司人員之撫卹較乘客爲優，實應爲改進，因公司人員之遇難，固屬可矜，但不能謂其無責。反之，乘客之死難，則殊無責任可言，而其撫卹如屬懸殊，似不甚合理，且爲加重公司謹慎起見，無寗提高乘客撫卹平等待遇之爲俞也，此其四。</p>
<p>改進意見</p>
<p>（一）應從速制訂航空規程，統一飛行導航之指揮，加强空勤人員之管理。（二）軍用機塲應於平時准許民用航空機降落，（三）增設氣象測候器，增加測候站與測候員。（四）修改機塲，並注意增設及加長跑道。（五）中國中央兩公司澈底合作，互相輔助，以發展民用航空事業。（六）加强飛機性能之檢察，凡逾時效之飛機，不得再加使用。（七）季節氣候，變化無常，在精確預測之技術，未臻最善時，凡遇天不佳，應即停航，（八）此次遇難乘客，應設法運鄉安葬。（九）中國航空公司，應切實整頓，各次失事當事人員，應分別嚴加議處。（十）無論何國民用飛機，如在我國領空飛行，應受民航局管現。（十一）改訂飛機失事之賠償撫卹等費。所有空勤人員及乘客之賠償撫卹，應予平等規定。</p>

<h3>本年度鋼鐵生產　孫越崎談可達廿三萬噸　資委會將在注籌銷售</h3>
<p>〔本報北平一日電〕孫越崎談：在本年鋼鐵生產計劃下，東北，華北鋼鐵廠礦除自用外，可　　鋼鐵成品二十三萬噸，其中六萬噸爲鐵，據戰前廿三，廿四，廿五三年海關入口統計，每　　六十萬噸，目前國內交通未復，若干工廠尚未開始，估計年需卅萬噸，即可足供需要，已　　　幾。以鋼價格論，外國鋼鐵雖廉，但加上運費每噸價格已達三百萬元左右，國產鋼則每　　合八十萬左右，故市塲可無問題。目前全國鋼鐵仍以東北爲主，的佔全部四分之三，最近　院長已撥二百億供鞍山廠生產之　。華北方而佔全國四分之一，其中以石景山為主，因目前　　應用龐家堡良好礦砂　幷陘之煤，尚未能有大發展。華中方面，政府將以日賠償工業設備重新奠立大冷鐵礦，五年內或可完成。關於拆卸日鋼鐵設備事，最近南京方面即可有所決定。孫氏末稱：披最近再赴東北，並赴第　，大同視察。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平一日電〕資源委員會副主委孫越崎談：行政院為獎勵發展工業，節省外匯，特設立輸人管理委員會，資委會亦已擬定本年度東北，華北鋼鐵生產之全盤計劃，幷呈奉政院核准，此次在平召開鋼鐵生產會議，歷時一週，於卅日圓滿結束，對各廠之設備，修現生產程度，前類數量市塲情况，業務組織，售品價格以及原料成品之運輸等，均加詳密討論。本年生產數址，除各該廠自用外，可供應鋼鐵成品約廿三萬噸，華北鋼鐵公司所　石景山，唐山，夭津三廠，除唐山，天津兩廠早已開工外，關於石景山懷鐵廠所需之宜化鐵砂及開　焦煤，此次亦與平津鐵路局協商就緒，於三月四月間開始起運，故石景山煉鐵廠，至遲七月亦可開工。東北方面，鞍山鋼鐵廠，除軋鐵部份已於去年底局部復工，供應一部份鋼品外，現正積極修理，不久即可全部復工。煉鋼部門，預定四月五月間復工，煉鐵爐因被共軍破壤慘重，須至本年八月方可修理完畢，從事生產。本溪及撫順所產之特殊鋼，品質優良，業已復工，本年產品，可供全國之用而有餘，炎委會並擬在上海設立營業機構，統籌銷售，對於價格，亦作合法之規定。當此上海鋼鐵市價混亂之際，該會產品，如能源源運到，當可收穩定之效，惟此項華北東北鋼鐵生產計劃之成敗與鐵路運輸之能否配合，有密切關係，尤以東北車輛缺乏，而原料與成品之運輸數量較多，問題更爲嚴重。此次鋼鐵會議中，對於車輛之補充，亦曾詳加討論，資委會瀋陽機車車輛製造廠，决定本年製造新車八百兩，以期增加欣路運輸力量，惟所需全部鋼鐵材料，必須仰給鞍山鋼鐵廠特別設法供應。比外，一部份車輛零件，須由該會瀋陽機器廠製造。</p>
<h3>日刦我銅元鎳幣　在長崎等地發現　外部準備進行交涉歸還</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕外交部近接我駐日代表團來電稱：在日本長崎·大阪等地，發現堆藏有大量之我國銅元，鎳幣，此皆日軍侵佔我國期間，向我國民刦掠沒收而得，殆無疑義。外部據報後，頃巳公函各省市，請速調查各該省市人民在日軍侵佔期間所受損失之數量及證據，俾於羹集後，函請行政院對日賠償委員會向日本交涉歸還。</p>
<h3>日本首批賠償品　我要求分配半數</h3>
<p>〔本報北平一日電〕工業界訊：美政府授權麥克阿瑟先行處理百分之二十日本賠償工業設備（其全部爲七百萬噸至一千二百萬噸之間），最近即可有所決定，我國要求分配首批工業設備百分之五十，能否成功尚不可知。據悉：我國出席處理賠償工業設備之五人委會人選業已派定。如中國之要求成功，則將獲得六十萬噸之工業設備，將如何運輸並重新配置此等機器，實係艱鉅繁重之工作，以運輸倫，本年將負拆卸並運至日港口登船之任務，但上船後即歸我負責。據估計，僅此一項，運輸費用，即需法幣兩萬億元及美金三千九百萬元。同時我港口尚無起卸一百四十噸重之起重機，亦須從速設備，若再加以國內運輸及配置工作，或須數年之後始可完成。</p>
<h3>東北經濟委會　全部人員發表</h3>

<h3>越南戰事正緊　滇越路緩修築</h3>
<p>〔本報昆明一日電〕滇越鐵路工程委員會，頃奉交部令，以越南戰事正緊，滇越路之修築暫予綏議，本年度工程費不再列入預算，俟時局好轉，再行興工。該曾以目前　越路修復已達全程十分之八，且河口至翳汎寨及碧色寨至縣鍋寨兩段路面已舖好，僅須架設鋼軌，即可通車，現正亟力加緊工作，將已成路戲舖修究善，以後局勢轉變，再訂計劃。同時，該會以人不敷出，亦擬三點計劃：（一）亂職人員不再補充，（二）緊縮開支，（三）盡量利用廢物。</p>

<h3>大成殿上燈光如豆　丁默邨案辯論終結　首都高院定八日下午宣判</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕丁默邨漢奸案，經首都高院一日九個半小時日以繼夜長時期審訉後，已告辯論終結，定八日下午三時宣判。據金世鼎庭長當庭宣布，院方如認必要，將再開辯論庭。</p>
<p>首都高院刑庭，一日係第四庭審問丁逆，由庭長金世鼎任審判長，推事葛召某，申屠宸陪審，檢察官陳欐祖午後亦出庭。丁逆今着藍色緊罩袍，携一滿儲卷宗乙大皮包，面色較前更見憔悴，上庭後，時時以手捧心，間作乾咳，並曾一度以體弱多病，說話無力爲託詞，要求改期更審，惟於丑表功時，一人站於洋油燈前，侃侃而談者，達兩小時之久，大成殿上四週黝黑，燈光如豆，全塲五六百人，屏息聽其自吹自唱，使人懷及京虧夜審潘洪情境，毛骨爲之悚然。</p>
<p>今日審訊中，最爲引人注意者，爲丁逆殺書前上海特區高院郁華庭長及軍統局地下工作人員鄉蘋如兩案，都夫人陳蔭並出庭作證，說明郁華於民國廿八年十一月廿三日上午九時被售後，其車夫尾追時，曾見兇手上「七八四一」號汽車逸去。該車當日午後三四時又在七十六號門首發現，而丁逆又爲該特工機關頭子，故丁應負完全責任。郁夫人又指出該案發生後，鄭蘋如曾於丁很高興時徵諷何以殺此淸官。丁答，余事先曾派人令其加入和運，而郁不識事務，因此殺隻鷄給猢猻看看，並警吿鄭汝為（鄭鐵江，蘇地院刑庭庭畏）亦應識相加入，應知七二呼籲號並非無人。</p>
<p>丁對郁案幫作狡辯，首調：渠係被迫加入七十六號，無　無勇，實力全操吳世寳諸人手中，本身亦受控制，　論殺人。擺指出當時汪逆尙未組府，似無殺害法官必要，同時，當時敵寇在滬特工機　至少有四個，不一定指係七十六號　　。最後並舉出郁太太所指汽車先後　述號碼並不一致，郁太太旣指出　王少甫其人者所有，　上對此積極證據似應加以調查。</p>
<p>關於鄭蘋如慘遭丁逆殺害案，庭上曾舉出上海法院傳詢潘逆三省及　蘋如等人之筆　，團明確係丁逆所爲，並當庭宣讀鄭於七十六號時所寄家中之信作證。該信後交丁逆閱看，丁持信後，對信封反覆細看，對郵票及封口處尤為注意，最後並細看簿名及日期，其看信神氣，使人一望即知爲一老幹特務者。丁逆及其辯護律師對該案之答辯，爲此信並無年份，亦無發信地址，是否爲鄭所寫，無法證明，丁並誣鄭生母爲日本人，自幼生長日本，在加入地下工作前，即與日方特工發生關係，又與日本共黨牽速，殺彼者爲日人，同時牽運者且有多人，對於因所求不遂下毒手事，則矢口否認。</p>
<p>丁今日受審時，對其奉命在浙工作一段，反覆陳說，自認此舉至少使一千萬人生命得以保全，頗爲自詡，且頻頻謂此事非「丑表功」，僅係「說明心跡」，並效周逆佛海口吻，謂：「我丁英所做，一切可謂係通謀本國，反抗日本」，曾下頗爲得意，目視旁聽席，希望「庭上與社會能主持公道」。</p>
<p>檢察官陳繩　對丁種種謬說嚴加馭斥，認爲國家法紀與正　計，對此種反覆小人，應嚴加制裁，對丁所提保全浙省一千萬人事，亦認「小功不足以掩大過」，蓋丁種種作為阻碍抗戰，實爲害四億五千萬同胞也，至丁殺書郁華等案，皆在丁任七十六號頭子任內之事，丁自不能辭其千係。</p>
<p>今日刑庭係十時開始，中午時事休息，即續開庭，至晚九時半始畢。</p>

<p>〔中央社香港一日電〕聞我政府刻正請求香港常局，引渡利用海軍登陸艇載運價約八千萬元之違禁品於珠江三角洲之虎門，被我海關拿獲後現匿於港之逃犯，我海軍軍官數人並從犯十人以上，已爲粵當局拿獲，但主犯已逃入香港，我政府對此案發展，正予密切注意。</p>
<p>〔中央社南台卅一日電〕桂永淸氏答覆記者之詢問稱：粵省海軍登陸艇走私案，情節相當複雜，余至粵後，即多方澈查，現已將人犯十八名押解於峨嵋號軍艦中，以便帶京訊辦。</p>

<h3>社論　日本的政潮與工潮</h3>
<p>日本吉田內閣於上月廿八日在全國人民的「倒閣」呼聲中提出總辭職之後，即奉日皇之命，另行組織新閣；吉田首相雖欲聯合社會自由與進步三大政黨，組織日本舉國一致的民主政府，但因社會黨的堅決拒絕參加新閣，乃不得不放棄拉攏社會黨入閣的企圖，而另行組織自由與進步兩黨的聯合內閣，新閣雖已於昨日成立，其名單亦己呈請日皇批准，但是日本的政潮，仍是方興未艾，不但一般人民繼續其倒閣運動，而且議會議昌對於吉田內閣的政組，也深表不滿，認爲吉田首相選擇閣員的方法，不合民主原則。</p>
<p>橫在吉田新閣的面前，仍有着許多困難的問題，就是在吉田首相本人，也知之甚諗。在去年十二月十七日全國人民團體舉行「倒閣國民大會」之後，吉田本人即明瞭日本政治的困難，尤其是目前的經濟危機，改組內閣，若僅僅再容納些進步與自由兩黨的份子參加進去，換湯不換藥，也不能打破目前日本的經濟難關，而須要以勞工大衆爲背景的社會黨參加在內，始能面目一新，安渡目前的難關。所以在其內閣提出總辭呈之後，就與社會進步兩黨領袖會商，進行組織舉國一致的聯合政府。社會黨始終堅持其所提出的三項要求：（一）要求調換石橋藏相，以澈底改變其所採取的財政政策；（二）要求國民與協同兩黨，同時參加新內閣；（三）要求社會黨左派份子鈴木與加藤二人，添入社會黨名單內，而將名單內的右派份子减少一二人。這三項要求，當非吉田所能接受，因此聯合政府的計劃，也就不得不予以放棄，而另謀出路了。</p>
<p>從吉田新閣構成的成分看來，自由黨在內閣中所處的地位，比較以前更加增強了，所增加的無黨無派，也大半是保守份子，這種內閣在目前是否爲日本大多數人民所歡迎，當然是一個極嚴重的問題，尤其是藏相石橋的蟬聯，最爲一般人民所不滿。社會黨的拒不參加內閣，反而格外獲得勞工大衆的擁護，使工人方面對於倒閣運動，更加要熱烈參加了。所以日本工人三百餘萬人擬乘日本政府與公務員協會代表舉行最後一决談判決裂，決定於二月一日實行世界史上規模最大的罷工。日本政府以及盟國管制當局，對於這種空前未有的大罷工潮，如果在事前不設法防止，則其爲患之烈，實在超過火山爆發或其他性質的災難。所以負有管制日本的盟軍最高統帥部，不得不採取高壓手段，下令禁止日本工人罷工。</p>
<p>我們看了麥帥對於此事所發表的聲明：『余所以採取此項措置，乃爲防止公共福利遭受致命打擊，日本社會，旣因戰敗而處於盟軍管制之下，其都市蕭條，工業停頓，國民之大部份，均彷徨於飢餓綫上，罷工將破壤運輸與通訊；阻制煤炭之移動，使產業完全陷於停頓狀態，勢所難免。此事將使日人陷於災難之中。』也可以從此窺出日本目前的實際情况了。過去日本所發生的工潮，因爲日本共產黨所鼓動，但是吉田內閣對於勞工階級的要求，常常置若罔聞，不稍顧惜，反而動輒採取高壓政策，所謂壓力愈大，反響也愈大，故吉田內閣，對於日本工潮的蔓延與擴大，也不能不負相當的責任。事至如今，日來的工潮益發不可抑制了，而麥帥仍採取高壓政策，禁止日本工人罷工。日本工會對於麥帥的命令固不得不遵守，而重行考慮其實行罷工的決定；萬一日本工人堅持成見，非實行罷工不可，則其後果，實在不堪設想，從此日本國內更要陷於紊亂狀態了。</p>
<p>回想盟國在白本屈膝投降後開始管制之時？曾明白宣佈管制日本的目標，乃在使日本政治走上民主化的大道，在國際間也成爲愛好和平的國家之一，不復東山更起威脅遠東和平。從那時起至今天爲止，將近一年有半了，看看麥帥管制日本的政績，想想白本的政治是否己走上民主化的途徑？對於日本政治的前途，實在不敢過分樂觀。目下日本事事要順從麥帥的命令，所以內閣的更迭，不是自由黨的吉田，就是進步黨的幣原，換來換去，終難令日本人民滿意，而使日本人民不得不站起來，舉行倒閣運動，叫出打倒內閣的口號，麥帥不顧日本的民意，一味採取高壓政策，企圖使日本的政權永遠被握在保守份子的手裹，這種政策是否與其管制的目標相吻合？麥帥實有重加考慮的必要。</p>
<p>要之，今日的日本，不論在政治上經濟上社會上，都已顯示出動亂的現象，目下所潑生的政潮與工潮似非吉田與幣原之流所能解決的。</p>

<h3>傳染病院遷址太僻</h3>
<p>我們是市立第二傳染病醫院工作者，最近我們的醫院將如報上揭載的要從海寗終搬到八字橋，這事關係全市每一個市民的利害。素仰貴報是人民的喉舌，現在我們想在市民的立塲上說幾句話，提出三點理由，希望刊登：</p>
<p>（一）院址偏遠，傳染病大多是急性的，假使住在　區　區的人，染到了某種急性傳染病，雇車伴送至八字橋，途中就要耗去二三小時這麼久的時間內就可能病勢惡化，躭誤了人命</p>
<p>（二）交通不便，傳染病醫院要擇在交通適中的地方，以使臨時配購藥械，八字橋地處偏僻，究有公共交通工具，伴送病人或因往返不便而却步，就看現在第一傳染病院，因設在天通電路交通較海寗路不便，平日病人遠不及第二傳染病院多，這點就可證明交通便利也很為重要。</p>
<p>（三）院舍太小，病人隔離是傳染病醫院很重要的一件事，那是非要有寛大的院舍才能辦到，照目前我們院中病人每日平均在八九十人左右，尤其像去年盛行霍亂時期，病人增到二百多走廊上都睡滿了，直到沒有餘地安置才止收容，偌大的上海市，僅有兩個市立傳染病院，應亟需擴充，如今反遷移至狹小的八字橋院址去，豈不是與事實需要上背道而駛了嗎</p>
<p>以上三點意見，完全是爲大衆的利益着想，望社會賢達，予以支援爲幸。（市立第二傳染病醫院醫護人員）</p>
<h3>藝師初中生怎安挿</h3>
<p>市立藝術師範已由參議會議決撤併，據報載師範生併入新陸師範，惟初中部學生有三百名，佔全校學生總數七分之六，將如何安插？未見報載，探問校方亦無消息。不入各校即將開學上課，想當局決不使我們三百名學生中途失學，而妥籌辦法，請各位參議員要明瞭投考該校初中部學生之家庭，大都居住鄰近且經濟力量都屬有限的，熱望利用藝術師範原址，設一市立普通男子中學，使我們不致失學，几有升人高中部之機會，同時要請參議會及敎育局即日將三百餘學生如何處置辦法公佈之，以慰各同學及家長之熱望，造福市民非淺！（李羣强〕</p>

<h3>巴勒斯坦局勢緊張　英政府下令婦孺儘速撤退　發動反猶太恐怖運動先聲</h3>
<p>〔聯合社耶路撒冷卅一日電〕巴勒期坦英政府今日採取嚴峻辦法以保障安全，下令英國婦孺一律撤退回國，政府人員全部進入安全地　。據巴勒斯坦政府布告稱，此項命令係根據親近頒布之緊急防衛條例，援權英國駐巴勒斯坦專員，爲便利保障公安或維持秩序起見，可將非巴勒斯坦居民中之不必要人員與以撤退。所謂「非巴勒斯坦居民」一語，其意殆指專員，如決定辦理，兼司令僑居巴勒斯坦這美國人及他國人撤退。</p>
<p>〔路透社耶路撒冷卅一日電〕因攻擊警署而被判死刑之猶太人葛羅納，已再度展期四十八小時執行死刑，葛羅納表示決不願向任何英國法庭上訴。按最近巴勒斯坦局勢之緊張，即係因渠被判死刑伊爾根黨實施報復之故。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦卅一日電〕所有在巴勒斯坦之英國婦孺及非必要平民憶奉令準備於十天內退出巴勒斯坦，倫敦方面認爲此一措施，乃英當局將在該處發動空前反恐怖運動之先聲。在巴勒斯坦高級專員克銀漢爵土頒佈此令後之數小時，倫敦英下院即展開巴勒斯坦動亂局勢之辯論。</p>

<h3>英下院熱烈辯論　邱吉爾又作怒吼　主張英美應共管巴勒斯坦責政府施策步向羞恥之路</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦卅一日電〕下院今日熱烈辯論巴勒斯坦問題，反對黨領袖邱吉爾發言，對於巴勒斯坦之卑劣戰爭與恐怖主義，表示惋惜，要求英政府立即解決聖地問題，否則除非美國願與英國平均分担其流血，紛擾及一切任務，應將巴勒斯坦之委治權移交聯合國機構。英國已破壤夙昔之保證，今旣不能實行其政策，即無留在巴勒斯坦之權利。英下院方在進行辯論，而耶路撒冷方面已正式發表布告，下令將巴勒斯坦英婦孺全部撤退。據此間政府中人言，撒退婦孺命令，不必認爲將對恐怖主義作全面戰爭，此舉大率係預防辦法。殖民大臣瓊斯稱，政府確在謀取最後解決。</p>
<p>保守黨議員即前殖民大臣史丹萊稱，若不能保持和平，則聖地將變成流血地獄。邱吉爾責工黨政府對付恐怖主義之手段過於軟弱，力言在爭執之際，不能缺乏鬥志，譽如最近之撤銷對恐怖份子所處之刑，實爲步向戰敗與羞恥之路。邱氏承認英國一日退出，巴勒斯坦極易發生內戰，惟英軍在現狀下留駐巴勒斯坦，不能以此事及巴勒斯坦之戰略地位作藉口。英國應留於蘇彝士運河區，而不再注意巴勒斯坦之戰略地位，且余從未想到英國巴勒斯坦有戰略關係云。</p>

<h3>日總罷工取消　倒閣繼續進行　麥帥禁令收効</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京一日電〕八百六十萬日人預定今日發動之大罷工，因遭麥帥干涉，卒告流產，日本全國今日風平浪靜，然此　係另一暴風雨前之沈寂。全國工會已暫時改取化整為零之策略，繼續鬥爭。由國有鐵路總工會，都市聯盟，大中小學敎員，郵電，行政人員等十二工會組成之「二，一」罷工最高指揮機關全國公務員共同鬥爭委員會，及由勞動總同盟糸，產業別糸各工會組成之全國工會共同鬥爭委員會，昨晚先後宣告解散。然公務員共同鬥爭委員會雖告解散，各單位工會，仍不中止鬥爭，正謀加强團結，決定於共鬥委會解散後，另設聯絡協議會。國有鐵路總工會今日發表聲明稱：「我等被佔領國人民不能不服從麥帥之命令，但事人必須打倒吉田內閣」云。</p>
<p>日本工會提出申訴</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京一日電〕麥帥下令禁止總罷工後，日本中央罷工委員會頃向盟國管制日本委員會發出呼籲、幷要求華盛頓之遠東委員會派員調查此事。罷工委員會上書麥帥，要求其充份瞭解日本勞工情形，幷促反動的吉田政府能滿足工人要求。呈盟國管制會之函，則對麥帥之禁令表示遺憾，並謂此次罷工悉在實行日本民主化及維護工人之重大權利，望管制會能了遄加以仲裁云。</p>
<h3>總罷工不成　將個別罷工</h3>

<h3>吉田內閣　前途艱難</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京一日電〕吉田內閣改組後自由進步兩政府黨，均表不滿。自由黨所不滿者為北海道長官增田之入閣，認為此輩「官僚」或「准官僚」不應起用，按增田以解決北海道煤礦工潮，爲當局所賞識。又吉田今後起用何大以就農相及經濟安定本部長官，亦爲自由黨所關心。進步黨對此次改組，尤表不滿，該黨議員會昨決議質問吉田有無三度謀組聯合內閣之意，又認為此次改組人選，不合立憲精神，此次改組，未有任何象徽，足以表示自由，進步兩黨密切提携以突破難關之意。該黨對吉田虎縣若千閣席、而不遴選進步黨人士入閣，最表忿懣，露骨表示吉田蔑視進步黨。故此問觀察家認爲吉田內閣，前途將益艱難，吉田所以虛懸若干閣席，雖可解釋爲等待社會黨之入閣，並非輕視進步黨，然鑑於兩次拉攏社會黨失敗之經過，再謀一决聯合工作，亦以失敗之成分居多。日本政局可能踏入戰後最大動亂之局面。</p>

<h3>蘇聯目光轉向國內</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室譯</p>
<p>我們祗要看一看十過去的幾次五年計劃對於蘇聯工業，經濟，以及人民生活各方面所發生的巨大影響，我烏即可了解為什麽現在蘇聯的目光，又在轉向國內了。蘇聯立國以來，四分之一的時光已消磨在兩次大戰之中，現在所需要的，乃是安定與發展。每一個住在伏爾加河以西的蘇聯人，都可以親見德國人去後所遺留下的一片荒凉，一切都需要重建。而東方，則是烏拉爾新工業區，自一九四一年以來即曾慘澹經營，許多工業專家們都相信，這一個區域會成爲蘇聯將來生命所寄託的地方。</p>
<p>在蘇聯人的心中，一直懸存着兩個日標。第一，是希望日用消費品的增產。這全賴五年訂劃的成功。第二，是希望國家的安全。史達林在去年二月間的演講中向人民保證說，一次次五年計劃的成功可使蘇聯的國力達到這麽一種程度，對於任何外來的威脅，都不必再感覺恐懼。</p>
<p>所以新的五年計劃同時回答了兩個問題，那就是：什麽時候可以有更多的物資？和什麽時候可以有眞正的安全？</p>
<p>就因為了這種想望，蘇聯人今日都肯忍受一切犧牲和苦難，爲的可以有一個更好的將來。在蘇聯，時常聽見的一句話是：五年計劃完成以後就可以如何如何了。烏克蘭的大農塲上，農人們在談論着有這麽一天，可以有更多的牛羊，更多的工具，更好的房屋。當然，在目前一切都很困難。不過，蘇聯人於接受延長食物定量配給時限的法令之際，都在想着，待這一回的五年計劃成功，這一切缺憾就都可以沒有了。</p>
<p>去年十月，在紅塲上慶祝大革命二十九週年之際，那許多迎風招展的旗幟上就顯示着這種國內生產的狂熱。旗上繡出着船隻，鞋子和書籍生產的最高紀錄。報紙上的頭條新聞也時常是工廠生產的巨大數字。</p>
<p>每個蘇聯人都知道，對於這種工業生產的擴展，自己將來也會享到好處的。目前，蘇聯人民所能得到的東西是很少，但他們明白，自己的工作愈努力，同伴們的工作愈努力，則將來較好生活的希望也就更多可能。</p>
<p>這種努力還有一個很大的原動力，那就是戰爭中所孕育出來的愛國心。在這次歷盡艱難的大戰中，蘇聯人民看見自己的國家已日見強盛，因此在心理上，他和自己國家的命運與歷史已建立起了一種不可分的聯繋。</p>
<p>一般蘇聯人聽見史達林說，要得到「安全」，惟一的辦法是工業生產的大量擴展。因此之故，蘇聯人都把自光向着了國內，不單是因為如此可以得到更多的消費品，而且也為的是可以得到自身的安全。半世紀來俄國人所受到的外來侵略比任何西方國家還多，而這次對德戰爭的慘痛經騐更給了他們一個敎訓，求取「安全」成了他們最迫切的希望。</p>
<p>目標還是對外的，不過爲了達到這種目標，蘇聯政府和人民都看出，現在最重要的是充實國力，主要的是在不業生產方面迎頭趕上英美。因爲了這個原因，目前蘇聯上下都把全神貫注於國內的工業生產，暫時地不願在外交交涉上太露鋒芒。</p>

<h3>白粳黑市狂跳　市長表示無憂　二百萬包貢米　維持可到八月　無限供應批價不變　其奈上海人大都不注意營養</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕爲連日白粳黑市價格大漲，吳市長特於昨日下午五時召集各報記者發表談話稱：白粳黑市雖已高至九萬，但中等米（西貢米及國產秈米）價格並無變動。政府繼績拋售西賀米，仍維特原批價每石六萬三千元，門市七萬元，且係無限制供應。本年民食情形，並不如去年嚴重，因政府已予地方政府大量食米。本市現有中等米達二百萬包。依目前全市每月消耗量卅萬担計算，即使今後來源斷絕，亦足可維持全市民食至八月份，故市民可不必恐慌。且白粳祗爲米類之一種，產地在蘇錫一帶，此次上漲，據米商言，係因產區價已高至每石七萬以上。目前政府配魯之中等米營養較白粳爲佳，但上海一般富有者，多喜食營養欠佳而價格反高之白米。過去政府無米，目前則有充份之米糧，但皆爲中等米，故如欲希望白粳跌價，一方面還希市民少食白米，而多以中等米代用，如此不使造成白粳黑市價格，相信在二星期內，白粳即可跌價云。吳市長繼表示目前麵粉之配售決不中輟，配便亦照舊。</p>
<p>米號業晉謁市長請配售徵實白米</p>
<p>〔又訊〕米號業同業公會因鑒於西貢米去路較呆，市民通常多喜食用白米，日前開會商討時，特決定呈請當局除拋售西貢米外，還望能將田賦征實所得之白米，亦能配售一部份，以抑平市價。昨日上午乃推派代表瞿振華，張錫潮，楊潤畬，蘇伯勳四人，往謁吳市長，轉達此意。適吳市長公出，四代表乃於下午二時卅分，再往晋謁，時社會局糧食科長吉明齊亦在座。吳市長當那表示：如其他物價皆漲而當局祗抑平米價，則米商與農民皆將蒙受損失。但按之一年來之比例，近日米價之上漲，顯屬過份，市府決加査禁，同時希各米號對超出限價之黑市白米勿予買進，一面勸吿顧各購食西貢米，則白米漲風自可抑平云。</p>
<p>存底不豐·造成黑市</p>
<p>又據米商方面表示，此次黑市白粳價之上漲，係因存底不多及來源稀少所致。由於高利貸之影響，廢歷年底前，本市商人所存白粳祗五萬祖左右，加以農人通常需過廢歷正月半後，方正式開始外運。故目前白粳審議之門市售價爲每石七萬六千元，而黑市已高至九萬元。</p>
<h3>物價波動　主席關懷</h3>
<p>昨據宣司令鐵吾稱：渠於此次奉召晋京晋謁　主席時，主席對滬地最開懷者，莫如關於本市物價在農歷年關時之波動，咸謂各種物價，若無限制上漲，則影響民生甚鉅，當謀適當之措施，而予過止，同時主席對於本市警察之待遇，亦表關注，滬地警察工作，較其他各地尤爲繁重，當給予其生活上之保障，俾得安心工作。</p>

<h3>輪船提早啓椗　乘客徒勞往返</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輪船載客，航政局以船隻大小，客位多寡，以及設備之情形而規定，如過量搭載，一經査出，須受相當處分。但舊歷歲尾，旅滬工作諸人，紛紛回鄕渡歲，致火車公路汽華及船舶，均擁擠與常，欲限制亦不可能，因之行駛口岸綫之芷江輪，載客過量，在吳淞口與華通拖駁互撞，發生慘案。此案發生後，航政局特別注意，在行駛通揚崇啓海各輪起椗時，派員至碼頭監視，茲悉近日赴北沙之乘客，又漸擁擠，故達大通聯營處行駛滬通綫之江康輪，前昨兩日均因乘客過多、乃於乘客上船人數已近航政局限額時，即行起椗。原定每晚十時起椗者，前昨兩晚均於八時許即開出，致一部已購得船票之乘客，非但說船，且往返徒費車資。更受其他意外之損失。故各乘客咸主張開船仍應准時，如欲避免乘客過量，不如於出售船票時，加以限制也。</p>
<h3>滬西區給水困難　緊急措置開掘自流井　需費九十四億待參議會通過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕滬西區給水困難，當地居民咸感不便，轉眼夏季來臨，需水股切，如不改善，則困難正多，現公用局正力謀解決中</p>
<p>按議前楊樹浦英商自來水公司祗供應前公共租界地區，自靜安寺以西，為越界築路，主櫂屬我市政府，但英商自來水公司早在該區舖設水管，造成旣成事實，惟因水管狹小，故給水不暢。勝利後此一嚴重問題，公用局亟謀解決。英商自來水公司與我政府之合的將屆期滿，而公用局硏究該公司之供應量，亦因已達飽和點，不能再行增加。且自楊樹浦至滬西，如敷設水管，其間直徑長達九公里，殊太遙遠。</p>
<p>龍華籌建水廠目前無法實現</p>
<p>經硏究之下，乃計劃在南黃浦區建立一自來水廠，以供應滬西區之需要。但其地點不能太南，太南則水管太長，經勘察商討之下，認爲現龍華機塲地區最爲適合。但因自來水廠設於飛機塲旁，對於飛機之上下，頗多妨礙，故尙成問題。加以資金與材料亦爲兩大困難，在目前高利貸情形之下，公用事業利益低微，欲人踴躍投資，頗爲不易。加以材料問題，目前美國亦因戰後各國羣向訂購，供不應求，故此計劃，當非三五年內所能實現。</p>
<p>南市輸送用水短期亦難解決</p>
<p>在此情形這下，南市內地自來水廠，因南市一部份工廠，戰時被毁，迄未恢復，用戶較少，故其供水量能有多餘。在謹記路斜土路口，有一水管，可通往滬西，以輸送用水，其間長的四公里，惟因此項二十吋口徑之水管，目前上海無法覓得，且即使水管能接通，滬西亦即需建築蓄水池抽水機等設備。故此方法亦非短期內所能輕易解決。目前緊急措置，惟有趕拥自流井，雖地質與水量亦多困難，終不失爲應急辦法。公用局乃於去年十二月間，擬具詳細計劃，全部經費包括自南市輸水及在滬西開掘自流井，共需九十四億。經送往市參議會在本年度預算中追加，公用小組審査時，曾決定原則通過。但因市參議會討論市府整個預算，至今未有結論，故此計劃能否全部通過，尙在未知之數。現公用局已進行準備工作，一俟三月間市參議會通過此計劃，市府撥下款項，即可配合趕上。如此滬西給水問題，或能在本年夏季前，獲得改善。</p>
<h3>全部客機　澈底檢查　兩公司貨運照常</h3>

<p>新電話簿係將上海電話公司及交通部上海電信局營業區械內各用戶，合併刋載，所列戶名達二十萬號。其編製方法，除使用戶檢査迅速節便外，並注重各種便利，其最著者，爲將新舊將名平行刋載，俾因路名引起之困難，得以解除。</p>
<p>此外，除普通營業住宅用戶逐一刋載外，並按照商號，機關，團體，職業之性質，分類編排，的共一千種。另有廣吿三千則。故該電話簿，實尙可供本市各界作通訊錄之用。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕西摩路大火案發生後，各界議論邊起，尤其對於消防人員趁火打刧一項，傳說紛紜。雖經五人調査委員會連日全力偵査，已略獲眉目。凟職嫌疑之消防員五名，亦已予扣押，然王雲甫家失蹤之金條手飾等，截目前爲止，仍無下落。調委會曾建議王家，仔組發掘火塲餘燼，當可於殘渣中謀水落石出。但王家因已於大火後，連續發掘三日三夜，並無所獲，故加以反對。然調委會爲澈底明瞭本案眞相起見，於昨日起已由市府派小工赴火塲發掘，由王家派人到塲監督。警局督察處長張達昨稱：「只要不放鬆每一把灰塵，每一塊破銅爛鐵，眞相必有大白的一天」！</p>
<p>又調委會為進一步謀得事實之眞相起見，特於昨日下午分訪新閘路美國憲兵隊，及蓬萊路中國憲兵隊宋志鵬。因調委會日前曾得情報，謂起火之夜，宋志鵬路經武定路，曾目擊消防員有搶刦行爲。據傳於大火旺盛時，宋氏見一消防員於火前悠然旁觀，當即推之謂：「弟兄，爲何不救火」？而匿藏於該消防員身邊之贓物即應聲而落。調委會為證實起見，特於昨午趨訪，惜宋氏因事出外未遇。調委會昨曾至美國憲兵隊，訪問當日在塲之該隊消防隊長高特門（Jack　Goldmau），中尉培責（Bailev）及是日値官滋維脫（C，Tzuet）等。</p>
<p>此外，大火案中，以凟職嫌疑被扣之區隊長李壎，消防警第〇一七號朱昌鶴，因已證實誤扣，於請命市長後，已於昨午交保釋出，現尙在扣者，有分隊長黃寳琦，班長第三四〇號尙志魁，消防警第〇一一號戴光榮，第一〇八號袁成鈞，第五八七號蔡洽英等五名，現仍押於警局拘留所，未解地檢處，</p>
<p>又昨據警局督察處長張達語記者稱：調委員於收集充分資料後，即可解散。至於刑事部份擬交由警局刑事處負責辦理。至調査會昨訪美憲兵隊經過，詳情如次：</p>
<h3>問道為何不救火　答稱隊員多新人</h3>
<p>高特門氏在前工部局消防隊服務有年，救火經騐豐富，當西摩路大火發生後，曾親赴火塲協助灌救，並因而受傷，其臉部及頸項間，昨日仍貼有橡皮膏，對於調委會詢問各點，所答頗詳，但對於消防員是否失職一點，堅不願發表意見。僅稱消訪員之不努力灌救確係事實，當時彼曾遇前工部局消防隊中之一老友一〇一號（昔日之舊號碼）並詢以「他們爲什麼不救火」：據答：「皆係新人」。</p>
<p>據高氏稱：抵達火塲時間爲午夜十二時，時第十一號已起火延燒。曾登屋頂設法斫去鉛皮，因鉛皮甚厚，斫鑿費時，雖曾將其移去而爲時已晚，火已延至五號洋房。當時亦曾分赴各宅洋房中探看，見地上皮帶狼藉，而出水甚少者。美軍出動協助之救火車共計三輛，陸軍，海軍及港口救火會各一。因火塲附近之水龍頭非損壞即已由中國消防加以運用，故接水之龍頭離火塲極遠，放出之皮帶達一千呎。</p>
<h3>皮帶破裂水龍壞　消防工具待改良</h3>
<p>高氏表示此次大火燒確係空前，在彼數十年之救火經騐中，尙屬首次。渠認爲大火延燒之原因在於廿九號東邊之木棚。若消防員能諳熟當地情勢，首將該木棚拆坍，當可免此浩刦。</p>
<p>張參議員詢以曾否目擊消防員有趁火打刧情事，高氏答：沒有，我是老消防員，要是看到了，必先饗以老拳。高氏末稱：要保證以後上海不再發生大火，則消防工具必須加以改良。皮帶破，水龍壞，必將貽誤大事。</p>
<h3>法國少女淪入娼門　不獲義母歡心　生活變成浪漫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日前本市發生十四歲法籍少女失縱，結果在妓院內尋獲一案，茲將此事詳情探誌如後：</p>
<p>少女密雪琳賈模，原名呂班，俄婦克洛披斯卡耶之女，出生後因無力撫養，送至卡米洛夫夫人之育嬰堂中，會有法人賈模夫婦，年老無嗣，至育嬰堂中抱領女孩，見呂班白晳可愛，即抱回家中認爲已女，取名密雪琳，時十二年前事也。歲月飛馳，密雪琳逐漸長大，賈模愛如己出使其就讀於本市法國學校。買模在辣斐德路復興花園附近，擁有房產若千，特名之爲密雪琳公寓，愛女之深，於此可見。賈模夫人對女則不甚喜愛，惟因乃夫寵愛，故尙相安無事。三年以前，賈模因病去世，密雪琳從此開始其不幸之生活。被旣不獲義母之歡心，且時遭責打，在家中毫無樂趣，乃向外發展，時從美軍冶遊蓋女雖年僅十四，然發育高大，儼然成人矣，自是生活逐漸放蕩，而買模夫人對之亦愈生惡感。三個月前，女忽吿失蹤，賈模夫人固示之不得，故漢不介意，不予尋覓。會有隣居俄人諾維斯基，爲賈模生前好友，對女頗其同情，見女長期不歸，因起疑慮，即與友人商討，由此間俄文日報主筆吉力金揚露密雪琳失蹤之消息，並籲請市政常局加以偵査，始於最近在派克路某妓院發現據悉密雪琳離家後曾與美軍膩友赴虹口叧一妓院中，該妓院主人未敢收留，後由一僕役介紹轉賣至派克路妓院，當密雪琳被發現後，由吉力金等俄籍友人領回時，渠猶哀求「請勿帶余至義母處！」渠義母賈模夫人現己延聘普萊姆律師向地院申訴，要求脫離母女關係，密雪琳則由父執諾維斯基代聘希夫盛哥律師辯護。地院已開過一庭，原吿方面聲稱密雪琳行爲不檢，依據法國法律應由前育嬰堂主人卡米洛夫領回，被吿律師則認爲當初賈模領養之時，雙方簽有字據，故密雪琳實爲合法之女兒，不能因其行爲不檢而脫離關係。現由地院諭令兩造提供法國法律條文及領養證據後改期再訊。</p>

<h3>美軍目睹消防員　倚牆袖手作旁觀</h3>

<h3>看看人家想想自己</h3>
<p>彼等於詳細報吿當日施救經過後，並常塲表演救火情形。其帮浦，皮帶等設備良好，且動作熟練，即使在實習時，各消防員之精神極爲緊張。自車輛開出，至出水爲止，爲時僅五分鐘。</p>
<h3>調查委員會　設置意見箱</h3>
<p>調委會自昨日起已於火塲中設置意見箱一具，舉凡罪犯行爲之揭發及消防設施之改進等均望市民能够發表意見，予當局以有力之協助。投入之意見不必具名，亦不必負任何法律上之責任。</p>
<p>宣鐵吾對火案談話</p>
<p>關於大火案之調査情形，記者昨曾叩詢宣兼局長，據宣氏稱：刑事處對該案之調査報吿：已送交調査委員會參考，實不欲發表，至該案之眞相，當視調査委員會之調査而定，惟關於本案，本人於上月二十五日中間，在傳正模司令宴客時，晤參議會潘議長公展，談及此事，席後本人即飭由消防處周處長負責澈査，並令其會同該區區長保甲長向受災人及附近居民切實訪問，俾明眞相，同時復交刑事處張處長査明據報，並令其特別注意消防人員，在技術上及紀律上之錯誤。目前該案情形，當俟調査委員會調査結果而定。警局係爲當事者故本人不欲發表任何意見也。記者復詢以有人曾力主消防事業，改爲民辦，宣氏對此有何意見。宣氏答稱：消防民辦，本人亦極贊成，蓋此舉不但可以减輕政府責任，更可以加强人民的自治能力。惟各國消防，多係政府負責辦理，前上海租界時代，並有火政處之設立，世界各國亦多如是，火政與警政並立，其重要即可想見，因火政不但負責火災後之消防工作，而尤注重平時防火設備，刻以限於經費，故現消防處附屬於警察局云。</p>

<h3>市塲飛短流長　央行全力管制一絲不懈　金價被迫下挫　美鈔黑市亦連帶回低</h3>
<p>烚赤昨央行力加壓迫，高後盤低，晨開四一一萬至四一三萬，即遭壓力而下游，低價退至四〇五萬後，尙多維持，形勢徘徊不定，惟未能重越四一〇萬關。迄十時後，央行以四〇八萬之價，配給一三四〇條，並隨市力售不已，將市價壓低至三九八萬，始吿平穩。未幾又見回升，再漲到四〇六萬，後傳美匯牌價之調整，或爲六千五之說，鈔市亦回，午刻降爲四〇三萬。午後逢週六現交稍形回升，結果較前收回跌四萬。飾金掛四十二萬五，銀元平穩，晴拆銀根見緊，息價在一角八左右。</p>
<p>外幣昨初堅後平，美鈔晨初曾見高價七千九，後隨金市回低，並因流言若美匯調整，不致越過六千五之說，午刻回低至七千五，午後仍無大變，結果較前收回跌一五〇元。港票亦稍回降。結果較前收微降二十元。港匯昨因港申電縮至六八元而扳高至一四八〇元左右。印匯一八〇〇元外。英匯二三五〇〇元左右，成交仍祗港匯較爲活躍。</p>
<h3>華股市況疲軟對敲壟斷永紗</h3>

<h3>公債市況平靜</h3>
<p>公債昨成交仍不過百萬元，市况稍吿穩健，統丙晨開一九〇〇元，低至一八八〇元後，復升至一九五〇元，業中出入有限，結果較前收計回升一百元，餘者榮辱俱微。</p>

<p>昨市人造絲繼上日之除風，上午文呈高漲，一二〇號東洋有光做三百八十五萬元，高山及旭字做八十萬元，下午無市，但因絲織業配絲星期一均可提貨，第廿一期亦已申請，故塲外空氣甚覺虛軟，東洋喊價退至七十萬元，高山旭字六十萬元有人要，持貨者討七十萬元未曾成交，廠經昨仍淸淡，只D字等級做開幾担，價五百廿五萬元，餘無問訊，綢貨昨稍好轉，被面喊三百十萬元，格子璧縐有人乘低吸收，做大一千元，華錦縐三千五百五十元有交易。</p>
<h3>花呢趨俏</h3>
<p>細毛綫織成之光質花呢，昨市無一不趨俏俐，大批發戶喊價均超過紅盤之上，雖因門莊帮强烈拖進，而進口管制嚴厲，今後定到不易，亦爲一大原因。同時廠方開價，一盤提高一盤，更使人心感受刺激。合於春季需銷之袍料及西裝花呢，業中人鑒於存底有限，生產不充，外貨來源受阻，無不欣然色喜云。</p>
<h3>社會局大量拋售貢米　米價仍暗漲不已　食糧市況均紛亂不安</h3>
<p>米市南北到源共計二千七百餘石，西貢米配出兩市共計一萬零六百包，價格仍舊，昨日各糧仍一致在漲不已，高級米市塲仍乏成交，祗白元陰元，略有做開，價格飛騰四五千元，塲外更暗中在漲三五千元不一，雜糧油餅漲風亦銳，形帶混亂之狀，麵粉續升一二千元，麩皮再漲千元，豆餅原料昻貴，售心甚堅，飛奔一千一二百元，油市生油動蕩頗烈，暴漲一萬餘元，豆油仍少，菜油尙覺平站，蔴油亦無變動，淸油平正，黄豆油廠需用原料，收吸甚力，本街進胃亦貪，奈到貨寥寥，求過於供，續見飛躍五六千元，赤豆蠶豆亦隨各物跟漲三四千元，苞米酒精去胃仍濃，狂升六七千元，小麥物稀爲貴，劇升八九千元，芝蔴步漲六七千元，生仁轉口本街互相爭取，登峯造極，猛漲一萬餘元，各糧漲風仍銳。</p>

<h3>茶市紅盤開出　午昌購進陳抽珍　每担十五萬五千</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕農曆年關以後，本市捲菸價格奇俏，各種國貨外貨捲菸，平均漲起六七成之譜，據捲菸廠公會某負責人稱：自外貨捲菸禁止輸人後，國產於之產量與銷路已普遍增高，去年十二月份全市本國菸廠之總生產額爲十三萬五千箱，一月份產量，因春節例假與工潮關係，較之十二月份略爲减少，此次漲價之原因，一方由於稅額增高二成半至三成之巨，一方由於外貨菸葉進口量减少，國產菸葉不敷應用，同時外菸漲價，國產菸不免帶起，各菸廠批價，除以前定貨外，較前已增高五成至一倍者，目前各菸廠正伸請外匯，向外國定購於葉，以彌補國產菸葉之不足云。</p>

<h3>新加坡棉織品市塲　英印華義在逐鹿中</h3>
<p>〔路透社新加坡一月卅一日電〕過去三個月內，新加坡紡織品價格雖下跌一半，但較之戰前仍高出三倍，自解放期以還，黑市紡織品價格已跌落百分之三百，過去二月內，幾竟達百分之六十，某進口商稱：物價跌落，實緣充作輸往鄰近地帶之紡織品，在購進後，仍遭限制，不克出口，致堆存於新加坡。某華人進口商稱：最近由香港轍入之布疋，必須削便售出，損失在所不計，蓋價廉之意大利布疋，已乘空襲來，該進口商復稱：布疋價格，可望狂瀉，蓋上海之輕磅布，已在香港卸貨，預示下月天候將轉嚴寒。歐洲進口商亦由曼徹斯特及英國各地源源輸入，價格較港貨爲康，品質復臻上乘，較香港進口貨採用之棉紗爲佳，幅度爲寬，惟目前英國紡紗廠尙不克大批運來供應。印度出口商行亦有布疋輸入新加坡，略較港貨爲廉，較英貨略貴，惟品質大多粗劣。</p>

<p>〔本報南京一日電〕前傳常州發現神童張靑雲，京滬各報紛紛登載，敎育部專員杜念嘉氏因返浙之便，朱家驊部長令其道經常州時，前往看察，如該童果屬天才，國家可代爲收容敎養。杜氏曾以四種方法測騐該童智力，一爲塡圖測騐，所得成績與普通幼稚園學生相同；一爲機械記憶力測騐，所得結果竟表示屬於低能兒；一爲形數交替測騐，一爲迷津測騐，此兩方面之結果，與一般兒童相若。根據此種科學測騐之結果，可以斷定張靑雲並非天才。其所以能引人注意者，僅因其能作草書，且限於大字，正楷及小字均屬平常，此當係强迫敎育之結果。現張童仍由靑年軍二〇二師第一旅張旅長夫婦撫育中</p>

<h3>我體育界一大損失！　台杯主將綱球聖手　許承基病逝英倫　肺炎竟吿不治突然病故</h3>

<h3>籃球聯賽重見熱鬧　汕隊昨晚克全黑　女子組靑聯險勝女靑紫　甲二組晨友大敗培爾隊</h3>

<p>晨友活躍大勝培爾</p>
<p>次幕甲二組最友培爾登塲，晨友史久全籃下托入，何增錦上添花，毛炳福再加一球，培爾以〇比六落後，晨友則更見活躍，培爾一籌莫展，上半時晨友以廿七比七居先。易籃再戰，晨友史久全左右逢源，如入無人之境，培爾僅由胡惠昭聊資點綴，時間終了，晨友以五十六比廿二輕取培爾。</p>
<p>全黑不支汕隊吿捷</p>
<p>壓軸戰甲一組汕隊逢全黑，笛聲響後，相持甚久，全黑始得機傳中，何孝先轉身托入，首破鴨蛋。汕隊陳淸江還以顏色，林維聰遠射中的，全黑張少卿不讓專美，遠擲亦中，迫成平手。陳淸江林維聰分別建功汕隊以八比四領先。全黑心有不甘，張少卿陸大振互有中的，全黑後來居上。汕隊呼停密商，果見功效，再成平局，汕隊攻勢加緊，前半時汕隊遂以廿三比十五佔先易陣調將再戰，汕隊攻勢仍强，林維聰首探中的，何立德繼之得分，汕隊分數扶搖直上，五分鐘時，便以卅五比十五佔絕對優勢，全黑人馬漸形不支，汕隊猖獗益甚。陸大振再行參戰，調出陶紹生，奪回二城，士氣爲之一振，然時不我待，時間旣屆，全黑以四十一此六十三慘敗於汕隊。</p>

<h3>橫斷北美大陸　五晝夜萬里行（二）</h3>
<p>— 本報駐美特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>唱罷！加利福尼亞！　水菓黃金的故鄉</p>
<p>加州十五日航訊</p>
<p>加利福尼亞，美國的『江南』，水菓的　生地，黃金的故鄉。</p>
<p>加利福尼亞有享受不靈的春夭，有從不間歇的溫暖的陽光。臨冬，紐約街頭陰暗潮濕，芝加哥湖上積雪盈尺。然而，加利福尼亞依然享受著無邊春色，朋友們看見我帶著手套，匝著圍巾，穿著笨重　腫的毛呢大衣，從心坎裹訕笑出來：「好一副紐約客的派頭，到這兒來，都用不著了」！</p>
<p>納瓦達　豪財之州　冒險家的樂園</p>
<p>火車從納伐達進入加利福尼亞，要翻過八小時的漫長的山坡。在山坡的東邊，白雪皚體，溝　參　·納伐達州是一副瑞土山國景色，許多小市集，區羅棋佈似點綴在山野上。晚上寛虹燈照耀得令人目眩同車一位旅客告訴我：納伐運是美國最奇怪的一州，它是大英帝國的直布羅陀，是法國的摩洛哥，是中國的澳門。他指給我看了許多霓虹燈照得通明的『夜總會』和『俱樂部』，全是些賭塲的別名。納伐達州的經濟命脈，就是靠全美國，甚至加拿大四面八方來的賭客，這些人辛苦了一年或半年，他們到這兒來「豪賭」一下。因此，，在每一座納伐達的城鎮裏，都有精緻的旅館餐應和遊戲塲，他們營業是略形的，是依靠在畸形的『賭業』上的。</p>
<p>因爲各州都有自制法律的權利，納伐達便創制了那一套奇特的法律，私人的賭窟，規定每一張『賭桌』，每三個月繳稅六十元，這樣，他的「抽頭聚賭』，便獲得了法律的保障。婚姻的關係，在納伐達州的法律裏，規定得非常輕便，因此，納伐達便產生了兩個全世界著名的離婚之城；雷諾和賴斯伐加斯。</p>
<p>納伐達是冒險家的樂園，也是紙醉金迷的『天堂』一位納伐達上車的旅客說：從前，在納伐達州的任何城市裏，妓女和賣淫是法律所不許可的。自從這次戰爭以後，也便風行了。原因是戰爭期中，許多軍隊駐紮在納伐達，若干冒險家的投機商人，開創了道一『新業務』，久而久之，相沿成習，法律也便馬虎過去了。</p>
<p>「太平洋學院」。加利福尼亞　斯多克敦城中最老的高等學府</p>
<p>（本報特派員毛樹淸寄）</p>
<p>加州省會　薩可孟城一宿</p>
<p>我沒有在納伐達的城市下車。一夜間，火車翻過了加利福尼亞東境的高山。</p>
<p>加利福尼亞給人的第一個印象是「乾净」。田園，住宅，小橋流水，乃至於四季常春的樹林菓國，都給人一個爽期的感覺。美國人不一定個個都乾净，但是，在加利福尼亞，決沒有像紐約那樣的雜亂的感覺，也沒有像芝加哥那樣污髒的印象。</p>
<p>我在加利福尼亞的省會薩可孟　停了一天。在那兒聽了許多加　福尼亞的故事：</p>
<p>加利福尼亞的被近代文明開闢，還祗有九十九年的歷史。第一　發掘這新天地的英雄是；詹姆土馬歇耳，馬歇耳於一八四八年一月，發現了科羅瑪附近的金礦，據說：當時的發現是非常偶然的，金礦分佈在美利堅河的兩岸，那是一條從三藩市通達薩可孟城，積贯加利福尼亞東西的小河。後來，華僑們稱三藩市爲『金山』，就是因此得名的。</p>
<p>從馬撳耳到現在，九十九年之間，加利福尼亞曾經做過西班牙的領土，一直到現在，斯丹福特大學的　　，一律還是西班牙式的建築。</p>
<p>開發加利福尼亞，有盎格羅薩克遜民族帶來的近代文明，有西班牙人墨西哥人（他們原來是一家）的經營，也有中國廣東僑民的血汗。加利福尼亞從西班牙的統治下『解放』出來，歸併到美利堅合衆國的時候，墨西哥曾經派了十一萬八千人，帮助加利福尼亞作戰。我看見去年年底墨西哥新總統就職的時候，加利福尼亞的州長華倫，有一篇非常懇摯的演講，他特別强調墨西哥和加利福尼亞之間的友誼，他說：他願意負責使這一份傳統友誼發揚光大。</p>
<p>州長華倫　加州第一隅像</p>
<p>華倫是連任的州長，是當今加利福尼亞獨一無二的偶像。一個面貌雍容而富有堅强政治手腕的人物。加利福尼亞原是共和黨的基本地盤，共和黨約有力後台老閏，加利福尼亞的「機器』瑙崙父子，都是華倫州長約有力支持者，但華倫州長本身，有時也常常以民主黨的身份自居。一九四四年的民主黨全國代表大會上，華萊士和貝爾納斯兢選副總統相持不下，有人主張提出華倫，一直到現在，加利福尼亞仍然有不少老百姓，始終相信着他們的州長，兩年以後，將成爲白宮的主人。</p>
<p>但是誰說華倫又不是共和黨呢？有位美國同業說：他是民主黨的共和黨，也是共和黨的民主黨！</p>
<p>去年加利福尼亞州長選舉的時候，競選單上祗有他一個名字，他是兩黨共同推出的候選人。</p>
<p>我沒有會着華倫州長，問許多加利福尼亞的『老百姓』，他們說：華倫的治續是可佩的。他本身是一個愛國主義者，他能够配合共和黨那種保守正統的政治作風。但同時，他又是一個富有前進思想的行政一領袖。他從不忽略勞工福利事業，社會安全制度，乃至於退伍軍人的種種問題。我在薩可孟城的省參議會旁聽了一次，那天，參議會正討論論着退伍軍人的房荒問題，華倫州長提請成立退伍軍人房荒救濟委員會，請財政廳提撥一萬萬元爲委員會基金，另撥三千五百萬元，立刻購買建築材料，於最短期內施工。</p>
<p>一個缺乏朝氣的行政官，是不會那樣放手做的。我發現加利福尼亞老百姓的歡喜華倫州長，有如紐約州的老百姓歡喜杜威。</p>
<p>就省的財富觀點而諭，紐約和加利福尼亞，是財政收支最龐大的兩州。就人文社會的觀點來看，紐約和加利福尼亞，也是美國社會最複雜的兩州。</p>
<p>構成紐約社會的中堅份子，是盎格羅撒克遜人，猶太人和義大利人。構成加利福尼亞社會的主要份子，是盎格羅撤克遜人，墨西哥人和中國人。</p>
<p>斯多克敦　華僑達二千人</p>
<p>我從薩可孟省會坐火車到一個小城斯多克敦，在那兒我逗留了三天。這座三萬五千人口的小鎮有六千多墨西哥人，有二千多中國人。墨西哥人開着各種雜貨舖，小菜塲。中國人經營傳統的國寳：餐廳和洗衣作。</p>
<p>在這座小城裏，我第一次深切體會到，聞名己九的所謂『人種歧視』。</p>
<p>加利福尼亞是歧視黃種人最明顯的省份，十九世紀中葉，我們的華僑，　路藍樓，一肩行李，來到這新大陸，帮助白種人開發草創，一向是屬於被使喚階級。因此，以前西部的所謂白人，對於別種人的看法，雖不盡如『黑奴』，但僅不過是一個尺度的不同而已。一直到現在，白稱小姐和黃種先生結婚，加利福尼亞的法律是不許可的。在加利福尼亞的某些城市，某些區域，黃種人沒有講置土地和房屋的權利。這些片面的限制，同樣在美國，在紐約州，在伊利諾安州，在麻塞緒薩斯，都是聞所未聞的。</p>
<p>種族歧視　情况逐漸改善</p>
<p>加利福尼亞州立大學，這幾年不斷的展開着「反對種族歧視』的運動，經過這次戰爭的洗禮，情况逐漸在改善，特別是在加利福尼亞的幾個大城市，像舊金山，　　崙，乃至於洛杉磯。</p>
<p>但是，當我到達斯多克敦小城的時候，林肯旅館女店主給我的無理的嘲笑，以及非常不禮貌的言辭，我感到無限驚奇。</p>
<p>林肯旅館規模並不大，裏面有十多個華籍的侍僕，從管電梯到擦地板，他們所做的工作，無異於美國東部南部「黑奴』所做的工作。</p>
<p>打倒一個警敵容易，改變一個深入骨髓的，有一百年歷史的國民心理，是不容易的。它需要長期的教育的力量。</p>
<p>最高學府　也有中國學生</p>
<p>斯多克敦是一座中等的小城，乾净，整潔，像美國成千成萬的小城市一樣。城內有小小的麥克理峨湖，湖邊有高聳着的市政廳。電車和公共汽車的交通，非常方便。</p>
<p>華僑餐館集中在華盛頓小街，也有中國門面的建築，但因爲人口不多，營業上並不十分鼎盛。城外有著名的「太平洋學院』，是加利福尼亞全州最古老的高等學府。校舍都是十七世紀戈德式的建築，學生的千人。中國學生不多，大半都是華僑的子女，華僑在加利福尼亞全州，的六七萬人，年靑的一段，幾乎完全受的美國的敎育，敎華僑的子女識中國字，是一件比登天還難的使命。我記得到舊金山的第二天。當地『國民日報』的總編輯劉伯驥兄，對我說過一句非常沈痛的話，他說：「且莫把華僑靑年期望得過高，甚至期望他是回國從事建設，那是要失望的』。他說：「他們受的是百分之百的美國敎育，如何敎他們了解中國」？</p>
<p>水菓成名　黃金增加國富</p>
<p>舊金山和斯多克敦間的旅程，我用南太平洋鐵道公司的火車票，改坐公共汽車，葛來宏公共汽車公司服務的制度和精神，都能令人讚佩。一路上，兩小時半的錦繡平原，　不盡的菓子園，看不盡的綠茵芳草。美國是一個缺乏『花』的人間天堂，（因爲人力太貴），但是，在佛羅里達半島，在加利福尼亞，縱然是隆冬，依然處處有花看。全美國百分之九十的水菓，不管是橘，梨，桃，李……都出自佛羅里達和加利福尼亞。張岳軍先生上决來美的時候，飛機停落檀香山，一位檀香山的朋友，從他一簍被視爲名貴的加利福尼亞水菓，想不到飛機向東走，又帶回了加利福尼亞，賠了雙重的運輸還不算，水菓進加利福尼亞境內，一律都要納進口的重稅。</p>
<p>水菓造成了加利福尼亞的名望，黃金增加了加利福尼亞的富裕，亨用不盡的陽光，無邊無際的靑葱翠綠，更點綴了加利福尼亞的自然的美。我踏進加利福尼亞，回想起過去在美國兵營中，廳G工們陣陣唱着『加利福尼亞，我愛你』！眞有說不盡的詩煮　境。唱罷，勇士們！唱罷，這美國的『錦繡江南』！（於舊金山華盛頓旅館）</p>
<h3>一條國際動派　瀋安綫　通車記</h3>
<p>— 本報東北特派員韓清濤</p>
<p>十四日寄自瀋陽</p>
<p>瀋安綫通車了，無數的鐵路工人和工程師，就是這條路上的無名英雄，道條路是被八路軍破壤最慘重的一條，同時又有蘇軍最先把它從雙軌變成了單軌的病患，現在藩陽鐵路局，拿着零星的材料，和無名英雄的血汗，又造成了一條偉大的力量。</p>
<p>瀋陽鐵路局長王奉瑞，在安東通車慶祝宴會上說：「搶修，搶修，搶修，拚命搶修，公原到林家台間，經過了一個多月的時間搶通了，結果是路綫不健全，車輛更不够，因爲在搶修時，口號是「通車第一」，事實不得不如此，今後的問題是補救，是復舊！」</p>
<p>路綫在太子河上，細河上，草河上，橋樑，山洞，成了路上的大工程，二一里的山洞很多，其中一個竟達二公里半長，共軍破壤隊，破壞山洞的辦法，是拖機車進山洞，炸山洞，再在山洞口埋地雷，因而打通工程費的力量極大，橋樑破懷得最徹底，現在多半在用枕木架起的十三。四公尺高度上通車，危險，可怕，工程師說：「在解凍前是沒問題的。」</p>
<p>瀋安綫史話</p>
<p>瀋安錢是以安東做起點，途徑鳳凰城，雞冠山，連山關，橋頭，公原，本溪湖，以達瀋陽市區中心南方十五公里餘的蘇家屯站，（從此到潘陽市中心段，是和中長路合軌的），全長二六一公里，涵洞二十五處，橋樑二百零五座。</p>
<p>起初，建於民國紀元前八年，當日俄戰起，日軍擊退鴨綠江岸的俄軍，在五月初旬，佔領鳳凰城，當時，因爲運輸糧秣，成爲急務，遂由日軍鐵道大隊，開始舖設安東鳳凰城間的輕便鐵道，同年十一月三日工竣，計長六一公里。</p>
<p>到了民元前七年二月十一日，已由鳳凰城，展至下馬塘，後由下馬塘直通遼陽，嗣隨戰爭的進展，改由橋頭修達瀋陽，同年十二月三日，全綫工程告成，十二月十五日舉行了瀋陽安東間的首次通車。</p>
<p>民元前一年四月該錢交由「滿鐵」繼承管理，又改建標準鐵軌（四呎八吋半），於民國紀元前三年，測量完畢，確定路綫，同年八月開工，民元前一年十一月一日起，全綫開始營業。</p>
<p>後來太平洋戰爭爆發了，日人爲了增强運輸能力，曾有大陸幹綫複綫化的計劃，遂於民國三十一年起，增修雙軌，三十三年八月全綫告成，至八一五以後，蘇軍拆運走了雙軌中的一條新的路軌，剩下了一條舊的單綫，接着共軍到達，大加破壞，搶修通車後，不復有昔日交通的方便了。</p>
<p>沿綫經濟觀</p>
<p>瀋安綫，位處長白山系的山岳地帶，從瀋陽縣姚千戶屯起，南至連山關附近，峯　壘起，樹木業生，所以林產著名，人民半樵半晨，山坡地帶，可放養柞蠶，每年絲繭從安東出口甚夥。</p>
<p>本綫南端，中朝以鴨綠江爲界，它的支流有　河，草河比流，流進太子河，其他還有湯河，細河，都流入黃海，此等河川，在灌溉上都有帮助農民，從事於開發稻田。</p>
<p>沿綫　產埋藏頗富，以煤鐵馳名，其除像石灰石，銅，錫，鉛，硫磺，石綿，洋灰，雲母石等，產量都甚可觀，鐵路東頭在安東附近，西頭在瀋陽縣姚千戶屯以西地帶，有的靠近山腹，有的靠近河川，是一平原，多已墾成農田，但，不過爲總面積百分之九十九，所以食糧生產不足，供應尙須從他處輸入補給。</p>
<p>沿綫經濟前受敵僞十四年的壓榨，農林的生產，工商的經營，都操於敵人之手，再加以徵丁勞役民不聊生。</p>
<p>八·一五河山光復了，共軍進入鐵路綫區域內，所有製紙，製蔴，膠皮，紡織等工廠，多被破壤，又加發行紙幣等，人民大感困苦，近來民生稍甦，將來交通恢復，工廠開工，或可不難步入萬觀。</p>
<p>運輸的展望</p>
<p>瀋安綫不但是中韓兩國和日本大陸交通的幹錢，，同時也是歐亞連絡的樞紐，對於各地客貨交流，負有相當的使命，戰後隨情勢的變化，東北和朝鮮交通遮斷，目前，僅爲中國內部的幹綫鐵路，雖然不復有國際幹綫鐵路的地位，、但在對於國境軍事交通上，負有很大的使命。</p>
<p>沿綫地下，擁有　富的資源，造成本溪湖和安東成爲輕重工業的基地，可惜的是工業設施，都遭破壞，一時難以復奮，本綫交通，雖然搶復，除煤運以外，其他運輸，如果和從前狀况做個比較，實有「天淵之別」。</p>
<p>不過，路綫上，農產，林產，以及煤炭，對於國內需要，都市消費，都有大量的供給，一但工業復興，這條路綫地下資源，也必需急謀開採，如再和朝鮮恢復交通，不難重佔國際和國境幹綫的重要地位。</p>
<p>敵僞時期，受戰時統制，除通過的旅客外，多運輸工人，從事於工業生產，所以大部爲生產旅客，今後；多半是消費旅客，假如經濟復興，治安鞏固，那麼安東，瀋陽，長春，大連以及關內各地，往返旅客，勢必增加，運輸當必日瑧繁盛。</p>
<p>沿綫產煤，以本溪湖最爲著名，「公田錢」的田師傅，中心台，「鳳灌綫」，的賽馬集次之，八·一五前，大部份運往本溪湖和鞍山，用以鍊鐵，此後將供鐵路家庭和一般工商使用，因而在貨物運輸裏，以煤爲首位。</p>
<p>本溪湖，安東，在僞滿時期，都有洋灰工廠，所以鐵礦石，石灰石等的遝輸數量頗巨，今則僅爲木材及沙礫，假設東北工業恢復，資源開發，運輸的進展，不無厚望。</p>
<p>瀋安沿綫，農產，大部份供給當地的消費，但大豆，豆餅，豆油等，也時有從安東，大通，出口運往海外市場的，此後治安恢復，高粱，苞米等雄糧，也有向瀋陽和關內輸送的可能，至於安東，鳳凰城特產品的烟草，更有輸出希望。</p>
<p>鴨綠江上游的木材，前多捆　成筏，順流而下安東，以供製材和製紙的用途，後來，因爲水豐水電廠建設關係。多改由「北滿」運到，倘「鳳灌綫」能通至　甸，木材運輸當更有望，最重要的是沿綫的高梁米，薪炭等物，都供過於求，亦有向外輸送的必要。</p>
<p>觀察現在工廠，像安東造紙，紡織，柞絲工廠，可以復活，原料和製品的移動，多賴鐵路輸送，沿綫所用的食料雜貨等，也都由鐵路自瀋陽運往各地，據一般人觀測，一俟經濟復興，在運輸繁忙上，常較昔日有過之而無不及。</p>
<p>復舊與搶修</p>
<p>瀋安綫復舊工程，和搶修工程，可分成三個段落，第一個段落，是蘇家屯到公原間，這裏破壞的情形，在房屋略軌上，除了蘇家屯到吳家屯一段完整外，其餘的多被拆毀了，橋樑被破壞有二十三座，計四十五孔，總長四〇七公尺，山洞破鐵一座，拱頂裂開二七〇公尺，經過瀋陽鐵路局王奉瑞局長和員工的設盡方法，到了十二月二十一日，竟得完成了復舊工作。</p>
<p>第二個段落是公原到橋頭問，破壤情形是這樣：細河十七號橋樑橋墩被毀，路綫略有破壤，橋頭站全毀，福金嶺隧道局部炸毀，經過了搶修，剷除了隧道裏的障碍，架設橋樑等，在六月間搶修通車。</p>
<p>第三個段落是橋頭到安東間，破壤情形實爲慘重，橋頭，草河口間，橋樑，隧道，路基，鋼軌，破壤極爲徹底，草河口，鳳凰城間，破壤較輕，鳳風城安東間，除少數站內錢破壤外，其他情形尚好，此間橋樑被破壤二十六座，計六十六孔，總長一一六〇公尺。</p>
<p>當時派有搶修總隊，下分四大隊，各就指定區間負責搶修，第一大隊，橋頭至連山關，第二大隊，連山關至劉家河，第三大隊，劉家河至鳳凰城，第四大隊，鳳凰城至安東。</p>
<p>以上三段搶修，所用枕木，鋼軌和配件等，多由沿綫搜集採購，和拆除支綫，側錢，在人力，物力，財力缺乏之下，排除困難，奮力搶修，終將這條艱巨工作完成，而達通車的使命。</p>
<p>在道搶修過程裘，除了工程師們不避艱苦外，最使人感動的是綫路區工，就是一般人所說的道班，他們在冰天雪地裏，供獻了他們所有的力量，甚至於生命，他們列隊注視着列車通過，在默默無言裏，在胼手胝足上，看到了他們的歡欣，可是，他們衣政，不能禦寒，瑟縮狀况，令人不能卒覩，因爲他們僅能領到一些維持費呀！</p>

<p>電影与戲劇</p>
<h3>新片漫談</h3>
<p>— 馬博良</p>
<p>遙遠的愛</p>
<p>秦怡，我第一次看見她平靜的美麗，一變悲劇的眼睛，秋水澄澄，法國時人波特萊爾筆下的噴泉，不必說話，良夜淡月下，對人凝睇，一片純潔的淸愁，靜謐的美是甚麽，便是這眼睛的言語，訴說了一個時代。時代却敎訓了前進和落後，前進的愈走愈高遠，落後的只有落泊流離，吃罷陽春麵，徒發淸高議論，張着欲哭無淚的可憐相，不必笑他，這正是我們自己，誰走不過時代的界限的人，就那樣震震顛顛戰戰兢兢，狼狽不堪的留在後面，生命裏的愛也只是一片讓人恥辱的妄想，秦怡的眼睛就在片尾望穿這個遙遠的距離，時代的雲烟。</p>
<p>趙丹，深深刻劃出一個小資產階級的沒落的知識份子，他以個人的情感表達角色的性格，用情感演出的戲，明白淸楚，一個襤褸的失敗主義者的人生，就在那車子後的沙塵裏煙沒了，趙丹果然是超特的演員，前半段他的手杖和帽子都出乎鬧劇風味，後半部却是顯明的自我諷刺，趙丹演來仍有一種圓渾的調和，這就是說，一個演員修養的程度能够創造的境界。</p>
<p>陳鯉庭的取材値得敬佩，雖然他忽略了婦女是否不讓作賢妻良母的問題，但是，最近很少有導演如他那樣接近時代，那樣特出的創造活生生的典型。他的導演手法細膩明澈，但在細膩中有時見出迂滯，後半部的Tempo允與上半部不治。</p>
<p>他們三人叫「遙遠的愛」命令我們詢問自己，一半喬治桑的問話「爲什麽要這樣子？有什麼用？是什麽意思？」想想看。</p>
<p>玉堂富貴</p>
<p>哈哈鏡裏看世界，荒唐而且快樂，快樂得渾天糊塗，送牛奶佬也可成爲拳王，覺非發昏。方沛霖曾經抨學美國歌舞片，認爲歌舞班的舞女不過如此，每張影片都是這幾個臨時演員，看熟了，就不覺得有何顏色了。「金馬玉堂」裏的一羣印第安裝的舞女即是一例，許多立在旁邊後排的舞女，自短脚粗，年華半老，殊無美感。「玉堂富貴」獨能超特，高爾溫的眼光下，高爾溫班子的女郞雖然穿了一色玄黄，意態娟好，一個個依然各自掩映生姿，好像六宮粉黛，集合一堂，樓梯上穿紅戴錄，姗姗下階，也是爭姸鬥　，花枝招展，個個皆是佳麗，這一點就够人眩目了，「夜夜春宵」「金馬玉堂」「洋囡囡」「錦繡天堂」自然遜色。所以，聲色方面，「玉堂富貴」確能娛人。</p>
<p>主角但尼凱，原來我對他並無好感，正如我厭棄最近新興的一班滑稽角色一樣，這次發現他的可愛，在不裝鬼臉的時候，有時倒也溫雅，很少「自我殘虐」式的硬滑稽，即使是演滑稽角色，我覺得也需要一些眞擊，拳打脚踏必須避免，赤身露體尤為所忌，斯文滑稽就人於上乘了，若說男扮女裝，則「眞假姑母」已是頂點，不能再事抄襲了。但尼骪，假如不裝怪腔，可以勝過雷史基爾頓兩三倍，至於誇張成份，不能過火，流入油氣，不過要是卓別麟的諷刺，不妨加強，因爲那是掘苦，愈强則嘲笑現實愈深，到最深的地步，鶴見佑輔的話便用着了，「幽默和眼淚，有時只隔了一層薄紙」。</p>
<p>彿琪妮梅亞兩頰較圓，不宜梳高鬙，頭髮平披，允稱容光煥發，身裁亦以此修長起來，衣蟬翼睡衣時的體態就比「公主與海盜」中顯大腿來得窈窕，五彩片中的佛琪妮倒也可愛，可是我眞代她擔心，歌舞旣無特長，演技未曾純熟，喪失遠大前途，未免可惜。薇拉愛倫胖團團的，略似秀蘭鄧波兒，她的舞術矯捷輕快，才露頭角，如今已經走紅了。</p>
<p>北奔</p>
<p>華納公司不再拍攝「金城鐵騎」一類的西部武俠片了，但是依然不能忘情英雄崇拜，讓埃洛茀林換了一個對打的塲合，到加拿大的冰山雪野反納粹，故事發展過程尙稱明晰流暢，導演稱職，反映納粹軍官的刻薄凶殘，用槍殺埃洛的伙友和自己的同伴，追殺印第安嚮導等等塲面，總算有所建樹。演納粹軍官的漢麥丹丁，以擅演此類角色著名，果眞不弱，女主角照例又是陪襯，裘麗碧絲霍外形略瘦削，所幸自有風韻，配得上埃洛茀林的英俊勇武。「北奔」一流，其實是華納的一種較差一籌的普通片子，難得優點。</p>
<h3>關於「風流種子」</h3>
<p>— 新鳴</p>
<p>因「失去的週末」一片之成功，却爾斯勃雷藍脫獲得一九四五年度最佳編認的金像獎。去年他又爲派拉蒙公司完成了「風流種子」，兩片故事的題材絕對不同，伹影城人士都一致的讀美。</p>
<p>「風流種子」的故事貫穿兩决世界大戰，有名裘蒂娜立絲的女孩在第一次大戰時結識了一個歷盡滄桑的兵士，意見的相投，終於被捲入了愛的漩過中，但沒舉行婚禮，而她已暗結殊胎，待至臨盆之日，他竟又戰死沙塲，因此這孩子豈不是變成了「私生子」嗎？故裘蒂就含淚地過個給一個朋友妻，在二十年後她親生的孩子竟不認識自己的母親了。奧麗薇哈佛蘭就飾演　蒂這　重的主角，有扣人心弦的演出，個性的發揮更入木三分；實爲她自「亂世佳人」，「小樓春　』後最成功的一片，據好萊塢各雜誌的批評，推測哈佛蘭很有希望能獲得一九四六年度的金像獎·該片男主角的翰勒恩特還是初决上銀幕的處女作，導演爲「小樓春曉」的密夏萊葉。</p>
<h3>義務戲　爲什麼不賣座？</h3>
<p>— 馮長</p>
<p>議務戲演了不少塲了吧！</p>
<p>可是據演出的結果，賣座並不滿意，各報均有這消息的報導，爲什麽？</p>
<p>人家好像把它不常作是義務戲了，祗當作是某一戲院請了梅蘭芳程硯秋同台唱合作戲，那又是爲什麽？</p>
<p>這兩個問題我們可以綜合的回答：</p>
<p>（一）演的日子太多，打破以往義務戲的紀錄。</p>
<p>（二）戲碼不像義務戲，但是却很像合作戲；即使像了義務戲，又是人人輕頭，可能見其所長，所以提不起購票者的興趣。</p>
<p>（三）票價雖然從初議的十萬而跌到六萬，但仍是太貴。</p>
<p>（四）票價貴了，門口旣然賣不出去，銷票的成績亦欠佳。</p>
<p>於是造成了上述兩條約事實。</p>
<p>第一，演的日子太多，打破以往義務戲的紀錄；雖是原因之一，實在這個原因與事實是互有循環性的，因爲假使你說就爲了前一塲賣座欠佳，所以再唱一塲，也可以說是理由，但是今年過年更難，於是需要救濟的機關更多，所以義務戲一連再連亦是其原因之一，說破了這一點，也不免帶了三分辛酸性的。</p>
<p>第二，關於戲碼問題，我不想再詳述，因爲我在上期本週已經談過，同時他們本身對此點也最明瞭，後來的幾塲排梅蘭芳唱大軸，程硯秋唱壓軸便是避免都是輕頭戲的改進，又梅蘭芳的「霸王別姬」不用劉連榮而用袁世海那便是悔悟成打破大角唱戲必須要用自己班中的角兒來配的惡劣成見。但是這爲什麼可以打破呢？還不是曾了營業不如理想？由此更證明了「不到黄河心下死」和「不在失意的時候，不容易改進錯誤的（尤其是自滿的）觀念。</p>
<p>第三，票價貴了；假使有着一連串好幾台的義務戲，其戲碉並沒有什麽特殊可貴的（所謂特殊可貴的戲碼是平常化了錢所不能在營業戲上看到的，倒如以前的「戰宛城」中典韋用楊小樓扮飾等等，）其陣容也沒有添進什麼新鮮而具有極大號召力的人馬（這一次義務戲的角兒便是日前各舞台的角兒速章退云與杜夫人都不曾在內，所謂加添的新人馬祗是幾位愛唱戲的票友，那是很缺乏號召力的，祗少在這種梅程譚楊等大合作的義務戲上）其銷票是大部份需要靠着那些角兒的吸引力，那應其票價就不能太貴，至少要在合理的範圍以內（Reasonable）</p>
<p>如「王寳川」，「甘露寺」那前四塲因爲太輕頭，少能引起戲迷的與趣，所以我們不談外，這裏就選出兩合戲來作說明的資料；一台較軟，一台較硬。</p>
<p>（一）梅蘭芳楊寳森等「御碑亭」爲大軸，程硯秋譚富英的「六月雪」爲壓軸。</p>
<p>按梅蘭芳的「御碑亭」是他白天不唱的戲，今天市價一萬四千元。</p>
<p>程硯秋的「六月雪」也是在「雙齣之一」的時候貼的，就算他單齣也唱，那這齣戲的號召力一定較差，照旁戲至少要打一個八折，那麼頂多只値一萬六。</p>
<p>一萬四加一萬六是三萬。再前的各戲，還不是在平時梅程的營業戲中的贈品？所以不能計某價値。於是這一台戲的總値只有三萬。如今賣了六萬，可說是超過眞確價値一倍。</p>
<p>這是較軟的。</p>
<p>（二）梅蘭芳袁世海「霸王別姬」爲大軸，程硯秋「硃痕記」爲壓軸，再前是</p>
<p>梅蘭芳的「霸王別姬」可値二萬，因袁世海是新鮮品，第一决合作，也許可加五千，程硯秋的硃痕記即使也算足二萬，那也祗有四萬五，與六萬尙不足一萬五。</p>
<p>這是較硬的。</p>
<p>較軟較硬都不能達到現定六萬元的售價，無怪戲迷又不大肯自動化錢來看了，因爲倒底「樂善好施」的人不是遍地皆是。</p>
<p>再加上第四，銷票成績欠佳，那自然這幾合義務戲不易唱了。</p>
<h3>金髮女郎</h3>
<p>從「錦繡天堂」看來，美國人似乎最喜歡金髮女郞。片中十四位齊格菲女郞，倒有七個的頭髮是金黄色的。其餘三個紅髮，三個稷髮，一個則是黑髮。</p>
<h3>「遙遠的愛」的啓示</h3>
<p>— 陶熊</p>
<p>「遙遠的愛」里寫着兩個不同的人物；一個是心地善良的，只有理論而不能實踐的智識份子蕭元煦敎授。另一就是無智無識的鄕下大姑娘，經過蕭元煦改造後，受了時代的鍛鍊而走上遙遠的路的余珍。</p>
<p>這兩個人物代表着兩種愛：蕭敎授是代表着自私的，只愛自己和他自己的家。而余珍却愛着廣大的人羣。因此，他們兩個人雖然是夫妻，但在認識和思想上的不同所以結果只有各奔東西。</p>
<p>在「遙遠的愛」里明顯地吿訴着我們：時代和生活是無情的，它使進步的走向光明，也使倒退的沒落於黑暗。人該多麼地注意着自己。一步一步所走的人生的道路。</p>
<p>編導者陳鯉庭光生，並不是一個富於熱情的空想者，他是一個脚踏實地眞正的藝術家。他把一這對人物介紹給我們，讓我們看淸了自己所該走的路。道一對人物——蕭元煦敎授和余珍，並不是他空想出來的人物，而是他在人他間我尋到的兩個眞實典型性格。蕭敎授是代表着一般沒落的，不能跟着時代走的智識份子；而余珍却是代表着能跟時代一起前進的靑年人。雖然我們這年靑的一代是受了蕭敎授的改造，但時代的鍜練，却使我們這一代勇敢地走向遙遠的道路去。事實也是這樣：大多數的靑年，都可能走在他先長輩的前面，也一定這樣，否則，時代和社會將永遠停住在中世紀了。</p>
<p>使我深深地感師：它是在啓示着我們。要我們放葉自私的愛，去愛廣大的人羣！</p>

<h3>白首童心</h3>
<p>— 徐仲年</p>
<p>自古多才者必多情。石曾先生與素珊女士的結婚消息傳來，眞是喜出望「中」。每次石曾先生出席文藝茶話會戰星六文藝茶座時，必與素珊女士爲伴；反過來說，每次林女士惠臨參加時，李先生必然奉陪。有一次，那是文藝茶話會與星六文藝茶座聯合聚餐，李林兩位迎座，不在話下；有一樣菜，雖是素菜，却甚油膩，林女士便用筷從李先生碟中夾了過來，笑說：『我來代替您吃了罷！』雖則下一個客氣的「您」字，而那股漏露路於外的體貼入微昭示於我：他們的交情早已超過了尋常的友誼，更非師生之誼，「交情」的「交」字掉了一變而爲「情」：所以他們早就心心相即，二月二日的結婚僅屬形式而已。</p>
<p>古稱夫人爲「賢內助」。這個並非我打起「回到廚房去！」的不合時宜的口號，實在是至理名言：居今之世，夫妻而不能相助，——注意：「相助」是平等的，誰都不是誰的奴隸，——宛如兩隻脚中拐了一條腿！如果「賢內助」而能兼「賢外助」，那更屬理想。早年我拜讀過林女士的博士論文，近年又目睹林女士處理信誼藥廠的總務與主編「世界半月刊」，最近又有「交情」與「情」的交替，今日更閱李先生的喜函：「……而得知女士較深，頗增敬佩。……煜與共同工作「世界」刊物，研討人羣哲理，志同道合，洵爲賢助，因求與之續成正式家庭，期與社會革新相輔而行，允非林君莫任」：凡此種種，確實證明素珊女士不但是「賢內助」，而且是「賢外助」。</p>
<p>有人疑心這篇小小祝詞的題目「白首童心」中的「童」字有些不妥，恐怕應當作「同」。哈！哈！妙就在這個「童」字！試問：行過了結婚禮，飲過了合巹酒，送入洞房之後，年近「七十」的石曾先生，把「七十」兩字倒裝，必然只有「十七」歲的童心了！如若不信，不妨請敎證婚專家（已逾五百决）我的外祖吳稚暉先生。</p>
<h3>西洋畫史上的寫實精神　十九世紀英國風景畫家</h3>
<p>— 沈雁</p>
<p>自十八世紀，英國繪畫界可發見讚美故鄕自然美之民族感覺。英國當時之風景畫係以十七世紀的荷蘭爲模範，甚至有模做傾向。英國風土受海洋影響，與荷蘭有相同性質，此乃養成此種傾向原因之一。</p>
<p>有此種傳統之英國風景畫其進步較其他繪畫部門爲顯著，且予以歐洲畫界之影響與刺激頗多。自十九世紀初業以來，英國產生三個優秀作家，即塔那，康斯特普爾，勃寧頓三人。</p>
<p>塔那爲在風景　史上獨特之奇才。渠作品之作風，隨製作年代各異。風景畫之性質亦涉及多方面的。拉斯金曾批評此畫家謂「風景畫的米開蘭琪羅」。蓋塔那之畫，一面站在寫實基礎，强調主觀印象，而同時亦誇張風景畫形式，擬予以强而有力之感覺。</p>
<p>如以寫實觀點考察塔那的風景畫，則有如下可注目的性格。</p>
<p>一·塔那爲描畫火車的最初代表作家。機械文明所產生之火車，與風景畫傳統之自然情調，其性格截然不同；而敢以此爲風景畫的主題者，後來亦不多。</p>
<p>二·塔那很少以樸素之自然本身爲其作品，惟其素描則描寫自然的頗多。</p>
<p>三·據傳塔一那曾主張畫家應畫出「印象」，又特別注重畫出太陽的效果。如與後來之印象派代表作家慕尼終於創造色調本位之畫風的眞實相比較，頗令人玩味。</p>
<p>關於風景畫之主題曁技巧，塔那有濃厚的羅曼蒂克傾向。反之，康斯特普爾爲十九世紀初葉畫家中一位透徹的寫實派。經過幾年之暗中摸索，一八〇二年渠始將風景畫公開問世。不久渠感覺到英國風景畫家的弱點，於是反對當時多數畫家盲從十七世紀荷蘭畫家之傳統，而不重視自然一點；遂不顧一般社會需要，創造忠賣於自然的風景畫。此項風景畫，在英國似不大博得好評，惟對於法國年靑畫家則予以强烈刺激及良好影響。在一八二四年康斯特普爾在沙蘭西紗龍發表三部風景畫，均爲畫出平易的自然環境之作品。渠因此獲得金獎牌，然其實質上的效果更大。十九世紀之最大畫杜拉庫羅哇亦於此時出品「基阿斯殺戮」。但看康斯特普爾之畫，頗爲感動。即將已經搬入會塲之自己作品收回，修改後始再出品。這一年的沙龍，在法國畫界實爲劃時代的時期。同時康氏風景畫成爲法國畫興起的一大原因。康氏作品以活潑的筆，畫出自然的姿態，而對於田園風景畫，予以新的生命。渠指摘「只看古舊且沒有光澤之畫面，而不觀察新鮮綠野曁太陽光錢」之畫界的一般弊病。所以他的作品，在巧妙的技巧中，常含有豐富的寫實性</p>
<p>勃寗頓爲夭折的作家，他有超人的感覺，在他短短的一生中大部分時間，生活在法國，所以多交法國風景畫家前輩，同時亦從事年靑畫家的指導。他亦在一八二四年的沙龍獲得金獎牌。他好像是一個以風景畫連結英國與法國的作家。</p>
<p>要之，十九世紀爲以法國爲中心，風景畫特別發達的時代，而英國則先於法國勃興。所以十九世紀初葉的英國風景畫家，所處的歷史位置，爲在連絡荷關與法國間的兩世紀時間。</p>
<h3>吳稚老談「鬼推磨」</h3>
<p>— 觀周</p>
<p>鬼者歸也，凡生命結束以後就成爲鬼，意思是有了歸宿；所以有人說：人與鬼戰，勝則人仍是人，而鬼將成爲鬼中鬼，敗則與鬼相等，並沒有什麽損失，故鬼實不足懼。</p>
<p>報章雜誌上常常可以看到有鬼論及無鬼論等等文章，倒底有鬼還是無鬼，恐連作者也纏不淸；全世界人仕，怕鬼的多，不怕鬼的少，西洋人信耶穌怕魔鬼，中國人所怕的鬼更多，什麽吊死鬼殺頭鬼火傷鬼等等。我想就是無鬼論者，叫他深夜踽踽獨行於墳墓間，也要毛髮悚然呢！所以吳稚暉老先生不管鬼約有無，旣有「鬼」這個字，茶餘酒後不妨閒談談。</p>
<p>民國三十三年五月六日他爲辭謝翌年做八十大慶，致衛聚賢先生書中，略說：他自已是他的曾祖母與祖父在陰間買來的，買時曾以稱鈎納人肚中而生，至今洗澡不敢除臍穢，因此爲封稱洞之物，除則肚痛不止，旦已試騐而證明矣，壽更不可做，否則閻王知道，性命交關云云。他老先生善於說笑，眼見現在的世界，人鬼相若，所以常常談「鬼」。</p>

<p>這是一段坦直而少曲折的堤岸，由沙泥累積起的：上面長滿蓊鬱的柳樹。柳林擴展開來，直到村子底圍牆邊，宛如一重自然屛障，村子便隱伏在濃蔭中了。</p>
<p>堤岸底脚下是一條沙河：冬天河心結了冰，白帶子似的向下游蜿蜒爬去，大小各形的石子便在兩側暴露出來，一半嵌入冰凍的泥沙中，一半在陽光下閃閃發光。上游的山壑積存了一冬的霜雪，伴同晚春的淫雨一道流來，於是沙河開始泛濫了，河床漲滿黄滾滾的泥浪，不斷的衝擊和蠶食着堤岸，感謝第一個把樹苗植到沙岸上的人，因了他，沙河坦直地朝下游奔去，而這方天地也顯得春意盎然了。</p>
<p>村中的居民百分之九十九是農民：每個人從出生到死去，幾乎大部分的時間消磨在環圍數里的小圈子裏。他們很少接觸外面廣大的世界，只有堤上的柳林爲他們所最熟悉，同時堤柳也最熟悉他們，堤柳知道這村子數十年的歷史和一切家常瑣事，並且偸偷算計着：誰家的哥兒已經能攀上樹又吹柳筑了，和訛家的大妞在準備嫁粧了。</p>
<p>沙河，堤岸，柳林，這些平凡的景物，是千千萬萬個北方的山涯僻鄉所共同具有的：當我穿梭漫步在這一段堤柳林中，却倍有一種親切之感油然籠上心頭，如歸故鄉，如見母親，我不自覺的痴對一株埀柳，俄想起天外日久的許多童年故事。</p>
<h3>美術的搖籃　唯美的古希臘社會</h3>
<p>— 周圭</p>
<p>古代希臘藝術，距今已二千幾百年了。但是他們的彫刻，現代的人們看見了，沒有下驚嘆贊美的。我們更相信，眞正有價値的藝術品，是沒有時間性的。她能超然獨特地保持着她的「美」，不是國爲社會上一切的變化而使她减色，她永遠在接受人們的歌頌，好偉大輝煌的藝術呵！</p>
<p>古代希臘藝術的孕育滋長，自有她的優越的條件，我們不妨探討一下：先從地理上看，古代希臘藝術中心的雅典，山嶺起伏，東南西三邊而臨大海，加以一年中至少有八個月，氣候非常溫暖，幾乎可以不穿衣服。人民思想自由，愛好運動，他們的身體健美，當是意中之事。因此在這種環境，氣候，和人物的稱成畫而上，眞是好像置身天堂之中。旣已有了這些優越條件，加上希臘人的愛好藝術，當然很可能產生完半善的藝術品了。但是還有一件最令人驚異的事實，就是，古代希臘人，對於「人體美」的重視是超於一切的。每個古代希臘人都認爲「人體美」是在法律，道德，貞操，正義等一切之上。在道種追求「美」的信念之下，藝術的進步成就，自然造成了不朽的功績。現在下面有兩個故事，可以證明當時希臘人民所處的環境和對於「美」的感想。</p>
<p>據說古希臘時代有一個美女人，名字呌「弗里納」（Phryne）他曾經有二次在奧林匹克（Olympilue）運動會中，全身裸體着，使人們欣賞她的「人體美」。這在古代希臘時代是非常榮譽的事情。有一次她不知道犯了什麼法，被人控訴了。當伊受審判的時候，她的辯護律師，並沒有說話，祗把她的衣服都脫去，顯示她健美的體格，法官即無從判決，宣吿無罪了。希臘彫刻中，有二個女像，一爲La　Venus　Decnide　一爲　Venus　de　Anadyomene（附圖）都是由彫刻家潑辣克西推爾Praxitele　請弗里納做模特兒而彫成的。</p>
<p>還有一個美女呌阿司巴西（Aspasie），她也是當時第一流的美人。有一天，人們發覺她有孕了，大家都爲她的「人體美」憂慮，雅典的高等法院下令把她墮胎，因爲他們重視「人體美」此小孩的生命更寳貴呢！</p>
<p>希臘古代藝術的成就的因素、藝術家的天才和努力，當然是必須的，可是在社會上法律政治等等，與有利的環境，也是不可少的。今日的中國仍在飢荒兵亂中，希望明天就從「民主」——希臘的產物——的微曦中，逐漸建設太平的社會，使藝術家美化一切的一切，造成一頁不滅的光輝史，吾謹敬熱切地期望着，期望着！</p>
<h3>唐醉石的治印</h3>
<p>— 葉秋原</p>
<p>治印是我國所特有的一種民族藝術型式，凡受我國民族文化所薰陶的，同樣，對於我國這一部門的造型藝術，亦必有欣賞與製作的能力。所以我國的治印藝術也旁及於東亞的其它民族。其中日本民族在此方面的成就，尤堪與我國的治印藝術相頡頏。治印原非我國所獨有，官文書的簽發必須有印　以昭信典，本爲中外相同的習尙，英國內閣中至今還有「堂璽大臣」，就是明證。不過在外國，治印還不曾進到一種像我國那樣的藝術，依舊還滯留在工匠技術的階段，却也是事實。它之所以未能演變成爲一種藝術，原受了外國文學的限制。儘管中世紀的僧侶對於西歐文字刻盡書寫的才能，因之創了各式花體字；但西歐文字本身就不具有如中國文字那樣濃厚的圖案及美術意味，所以以文字爲中心的治印藝術，便不曾在西歐有像我國那樣的發展。這正如「書法」在西歐永不曾有像我國那樣的發展一樣。</p>
<p>治印藝術之在我國肇始於周秦，盛於兩漢，自晋魏以迄宣和，蔚成風氣。顧近代治印藝術之復興，實淵源於明季之文何，降至有淸，西冷八大家崛起吾杭，蒼勁古樸，直追秦漢，於是治印復爲文人所重；中國的治印藝術重又達到了一個新頂點，流風餘韻遂演成浙皖兩派，浙派以西冷八大家爲領袖，而皖派溯源及於文何，至鄧完白出，卓然成家，於治印別成宗派，望重一時。浙派本秦漢，尙簡樸，實近於一種古典主美的）藝術；皖派尙修飾，論其精神實相等於西歐的「羅哥哥」（Roccco）；此在藝術趣味方面似不及浙派爲高，故自讓之以後，皖派治印，幾成絕嚮。而浙派自八大家以後，繼以悲　苦鐵，至淸末，浙中印人復結社西冷，一時風會稱盛。然而曾幾何時，苦鐵旣謝世，即西冷印社中人今亦垂垂老矣；我國之治印藝術，至此復又凋零？</p>
<p>治印與書畫爲一體，故治印名家軏多書畫能手，悲　苦鐵旣均爲畫畫篆刻名家，即早期之西冷八大家亦莫不如比。故其治印能於超脫豪放之中，謹守法度。今之治印者，軏以豪放自豪，殊不知豪放中原亦存有法度。自苦鐵謝世以後，今日中國之浙派印壇只勝了兩位名家：王福厂和唐醉石。王唐俱爲西冷印社柱石，又　同服官印會；王爲杭人，唐則以湘人而致力於浙派治印藝述之復興，其功尤不可沒。王氏謹守法度有餘，於豪放似有未足；而唐則豪放有餘，於謹守法度亦未遜王氏；其治印也宗曼生，故其藝乃能自成一家，醉石於戰後自浙東來滬，偶相見，爲治三印，蒼勁簡樸，超邁前古，用爲短文，藉以介紹。</p>
<h3>Venus　de　Anadyomene</h3>
<p>自由談</p>
<p>神話</p>
<h3>大火記</h3>
<p>— SS</p>
<p>人間經濟恐慌，天宮也物資奇缺，凌霄寳殿外圍的諸神府邸，都在勝利復員後因陋就簡地蓋造起來。冬盡年殘，風乾水短，玉帝爲了保持天府安全，早就手令迅速組織消防人員訓練班，起用防火宿將祝融氏爲班長，以防萬一。</p>
<p>祝融氏雖是久經火塲的名將，但是辦事顢預得很，訓練班中召收來的一批學員，全是從前在敵僞時代幹過「看火」（他們根本就不懂救火）的一些人。一來薪水太低，二來眞正的人材難找，於是也塗的訓練起來，其中情形只瞞着玉帝一個人。</p>
<p>訓練過程中，祝融施出了混身解數，敎了他們不少最新式的消防技術，直到臨畢業的前幾天，祝融想起單是技術訓練恐怕不够，心理訓練和人格訓練也很重，所以召集全體訓了一次話：</p>
<p>道德良心　不感興趣</p>
<p>「諸位要曉得：救火就是救命，，救命是需要以各人的良心和道德修養來做資本的。……」</p>
<p>「爲了要表現我們的良心和首先，在緊急的時候我們應該犧牲自已；同時……」</p>
<p>祝融用眼睛瞥了一下，聽講的學員，一個個都在搖頭擺腦地打瞌睡了；情知不妙，於是提高了嗓子喊：</p>
<p>「將來救火的時候，爲了測騐大家的良心和道德，出發前和回來後一定要詳細檢査……」</p>
<p>話還沒有說完，大家就起了反響。</p>
<p>「反對！」</p>
<p>「反對這種蔑視我們人格的辦法！」</p>
<p>「反對……我們不幹了！……」</p>
<p>視融終於無可奈何地在一片嘈嚷聲中屈服下來。</p>
<p>畢業了，爲了顯示訓練期中的成績，照例有一次表演，全體頂盔贯甲，駕着新從美國買來的「幫浦機」，皮帶如龍，雲梯高架，浩浩蕩蕩，全部新式配備，南天門外擠滿了看熱鬧的天府臣民，臨時並且還邀請了很多遠從大羅天，酆都城來觀禮的諸神大仙人等。</p>
<p>表演當然是出色驚人，大家拍手贊好。因爲成績賀滿，祝融以下全部消防隊員都受到了玉帝的激獎，每人也都領到一點頒賜的賞金。</p>
<p>在一陣譽揚聲中，祗有酆都城的十殿閻羅悶聲不饗，他們肚裏有數，消防隊員們的心理被他們看透了，地府裏從此又將多事，但天國地府，相距遙遙，現在反正事不關己，所以也就在鷄尾宴後道聲謝駕土遁回地獄去了。</p>
<p>財神府邸燒光搶光</p>
<p>陰曆年屆臨，元旦諸神齊集天宮向玉帝賀年，晚上，財神假私邸盛大招宴，淸歌曼舞，笙管嗷嘈，盛况空前。</p>
<p>酒闌興盡，樂極悲生，就在諸神吿別回到行宮去後，的摸戌時時分，財神府邸三樓忽報火起。</p>
<p>「不曉得那一尊神仙丢下了香烟頭？……財神着了慌，連忙遺家丁通知祝融率領消防隊來灌救，家丁是有名的神行太保，一秒種不到已跑達消防隊隊部。</p>
<p>「火警！」家丁氣急敗壞地說。</p>
<p>「過年啦！你不要打棚！」祝融多喝了幾杯威士忌，已醉倒在爐邊，旁邊隊員們一堆一堆地在打「沙蟹，」瞧見家丁進來，隨便回了一句。</p>
<p>「眞的啊！火已燒穿樓頂了！」</p>
<p>「你們是那一家？」</p>
<p>「財神府邸。」</p>
<p>「財神府上？」一個隊員捐掉了手裏的牌，拉着其餘的人說：「喂，不是別人家，快去吧，新年第一筆進脹，不要給別人搶先！」</p>
<p>大家紛紛的站起身，忽然又一個隊員向家丁說：</p>
<p>「朋友！我們車子裏汽油沒有了！」</p>
<p>「正月初一，人家過快活年，我們卻要辛辛苦苦趕火塲！」</p>
<p>另一個附和着。</p>
<p>「好了，諸位不要嚕嘛！我們心裏有數，不會叫你們白忙一頓的！」家丁說完，返身先回去幫同搶救。</p>
<p>這時火勢已延至二樓，東西廳也都冒起烟來，王帝雖派了很多人來幫救，但人力總是不够，財神急得搔耳撓腮：</p>
<p>「二樓我還有很多證券股票啦，這下子可完了！」</p>
<p>話猶未完，救火車到了，財神連忙迎上去：</p>
<p>「諸位，幫幫忙，快點！」</p>
<p>「當然，當然，這是我們的責任！……不過，樓上保險箱有幾隻？」</p>
<p>「多吶，請你們先把它搶出來，去年十二月份的大羅天薪水還沒發，全在裏面呐！」</p>
<p>「財神！你是明白人！我們幹這一行的，靠火吃火！平常薪水低，今天又是過年！」</p>
<p>「曉得，曉得！……」財神豎起兩隻手：「十根，十根，好吧？」</p>
<p>「十根？……憑你這種身份？」大家共同的冷笑了一聲。</p>
<p>「你們先去吃酒吧！讓我跟他談判好了再說！」</p>
<p>哄的一聲，大家都散了，有的去吃酒，有的帶了斧頭只是往樓上鑽，火光裏祗見樓上下人影憧憧，像是在搬什麼東西，財神和他的家裏人急得直流眼淚。</p>
<p>不知道在什麼時候談判好了，有幾個人接上了自來水龍頭，皮帶裏開始噴水，但是火勢並未見减，財神家裏的人倒被澆得滿身是水，好像是水靶子。</p>
<p>燒了整整九小時，火光在太陽光中萎縮下去了，財神府邸祗剩了一只空売子，許多燒焦了的木頭上依稀還留着點刀痕斧跡。</p>
<p>等到天宮回復到以往的平靜時，財神雇了很多人翻淘餘燼，除了一點燒焦了的金鎖片，金屑外，什麽都沒有了。最後却在廣塲上檢着一張殘破的紙片，上面寫着：</p>
<p>「報警早，損失少！報警遲，燒光了！」</p>
<p>「他媽的！我報警還能算遲嗎？」財神撫摸着身上那件被烟　黃了的金袍，差不多要暈絕了。</p>
<p>事後，消防隊被訓練過的道德和良心已經事實證明，祝融終於爲玉帝撤了職。</p>

<p>戰時德國用煤製造奶油這方法，由茶記者在德國維登城某工爲裏發現。先把煤煉成焦煤，焦煤產生煤氣，煤氣變成白蠟，從白蠟裏提出脂肪質的酸素，加以水，鹽，和胡蘿葡汁，再加些東西使香味和白脫一樣。當這煤製白脫剛從機器壞製造出來時，像一長條黄色的臘腸，直徑有八英吋。有個英國武官嚐過，據說辨不出煤製白脫和眞白脫有什麼不同。現在這工廠正在計劃恢復白脫的生產。</p>

On the afternoon of the 31st, they reached the line of Tiefosi (13 kilometers north of Pixian), Goushangji, Nanaogou, Xiaoguichangpu (7 kilometers south of Tancheng), and Dashibu. The main force of the Communist army, gathered in Tancheng and the mountains northeast of it, is showing signs of wavering.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 1st] The Communist Field Army in Shandong, in order to coordinate the renewed invasion of northern Jiangsu by the New Fourth Army in southern Shandong, has recently concentrated forces between Pingdu and Landi in eastern Shandong, with the intention of invading southern Shandong. Their Seventh and Eleventh Divisions are concentrated around Yucheng in northern Shandong, having captured Weiji and wreaked havoc on Yancheng. Their Fourth and Ninth Divisions, a few days ago, secretly fled south from Boshan, passing through Mengyin, and advancing rapidly towards Linyi, seemingly to reinforce Chen Yi's old base and prevent an attack by Hao Pengju's forces.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 1st] The main force of the Communist army along the Taierzhuang-Zaozhuang branch line in southern Shandong is gradually extending eastward.

<h3>No Soviet Troops in Dalian City, 100,000 Soviet Troops in the Lushun Area, Gong Xuesui's Conversation with Reporters</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 1st] Dalian Mayor Gong Xuesui recently released a statement to the press stating: "I recently sent representatives to secretly enter Dalian to investigate the actual situation. I learned that there are approximately 40,000 Communist troops in the urban area. There is a shortage of food locally, and many people are starving to death. In the Soviet military zone of Lushun, there are approximately 100,000 Soviet troops and 500 Soviet aircraft, but there are no Soviet troops within Dalian City. Chinese and Soviet representatives recently held talks in Pulandian, but were unable to take over due to obstruction by the Communist army. I have had multiple talks with Soviet Ambassador Petrov. The ambassador asked me when I would go to take over, and said that I could take either the land route or the water route, but if the government sends only a few officials, it will not be easy to take over. If troops are sent, there will be a conflict with the Communist army."</p>
<h3>Communist Personnel of the Military Mediation Department Can All Be Evacuated Within a Week</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st] The Communist personnel of the Military Mediation Department will begin to withdraw from Beiping and Changchun next week. There are currently 79 personnel and family members in Beiping (including Niu Niu, daughter of Ye Jianying, and four other children). Including luggage and materials, 11 aircraft are needed. More than ten people transporting personnel in Changchun, including luggage and materials, require two aircraft. Today, the Communist side sent a memorandum to the U.S. side, first expressing gratitude to the U.S. for assisting with the evacuation and ensuring safety, and then submitting the proposed evacuation plan, stating: "The details of the implementation of this evacuation plan will be handled by Chief of Staff Xue Zizheng in Beiping and Li Chuli in Changchun, in contact with the U.S. side." The Communist side has not yet announced its completion time today, but it is expected that this evacuation will be completed in less than a week.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 1st] After the news of the U.S. personnel's withdrawal from the Military Mediation Department spread, the atmosphere in the Changchun branch was calm as usual. However, the work situation on all three sides was busier than before, and it seemed that preparations were being made to clear and end the work. U.S. staff from each team in the Changchun branch will gradually concentrate in Changchun in the coming days. Government representative Major General Deng Weiren and U.S. representative Colonel Tyson remained silent. When Communist representative Li Chuli spoke to reporters, he only expressed regret for the government personnel who had died in the mediation work in the past. According to a spokesman for the government, the Changchun branch needs at least one month to complete its work.</p>

<h3>Wu Tiecheng Returns to Nanjing, Expresses Deep Regret Over the CCP's Rejection of Peace</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City News] Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng took leave to come to Shanghai due to health reasons and will return to Nanjing today to cancel his leave. A reporter from the Central News Agency made a special visit to his residence on Haige Road and was granted an audience. Wu looked calm and slightly refreshed. After shaking hands and exchanging New Year's greetings, he said, "I have not had a day of rest in fifteen years. I took this opportunity to come to Shanghai to examine my health and rest, and I am very pleased with myself." The reporter then presented some recent events and asked for his opinion. When the domestic political situation was mentioned, Wu only said, "The CCP's rejection of peace talks is not only a personal regret for me, but it must also be deeply disappointed both domestically and internationally. The United States' announcement of abandoning mediation efforts is a natural consequence and should not be regarded as unexpected." When discussing the constitution and constitutional government, Wu said, "Now that the constitution has been promulgated, constitutional government will soon be implemented. I hope that all people in the country will work together with one heart to complete the implementation of the constitution as scheduled. The government bears the heavy responsibility for all legislative procedures and will gradually handle matters. However, the general society's enthusiasm for constitutional government is still insufficient. I have analyzed it and found many reasons, some at the top and some at the bottom. There is one point that has become a habit, unnoticed, but is actually very important. That is, some officials, even police and baojia, forget their identity as public servants of the people, serving the people, and act as rulers, treating the people as the ruled class. This indirectly creates a dislike of government offices among the people, so that all government orders, once issued from government offices, are met with indifference by the people, let alone working together to seek practical results. We must remedy this unhealthy state, eradicate this wrong concept, and then constitutional democracy will naturally have a new atmosphere. President Chiang has repeatedly exhorted officials to persuade and care for the people, abide by the law, and be responsible. He also asked officials to fulfill their responsibilities as nannies. This is the attitude that politicians should recognize and practice." When discussing the plane crash issue, Wu said, "In the past month, more than 100 people have been sacrificed, and several old friends have died. This is a great misfortune for the aviation industry, but the rescue work after the accident has to be criticized for being too inefficient. Because of the slow and negligent rescue by the airline and the relevant rescue agencies, minor injuries turn into serious injuries, and serious injuries are not rescued quickly and lead to death. For example, my younger brother was only discovered on the second day of the accident. His young life was not lost due to the lack of timely rescue, which is truly a blessing from the gods. I can only thank heaven." As for the stripping and searching of clothing from the distressed passengers in their groans or after their deaths, he said, "I cannot help but be saddened by the morals of the world." Finally, when discussing the difficulty of eradicating the customs of the Lunar New Year, Secretary-General Wu slightly relieved his worries and said, "The New Year has arrived again. In the traditional Chinese emotion, I feel that the plan for the year lies in the spring. The New Year always brings youth, brings endless hope, and brings new life. This emotion has also become a powerful encouragement for the society every year during the Spring Festival. As long as the people of the country are good at accepting this encouragement, while taking into account the difficulties of the country and the heavy responsibility of national construction, this generation must warn each other not to be selfish and self-serving, and the next generation must encourage each other to be diligent and hardworking, to be productive and proactive, and to lay a solid foundation for the country and the nation, and work together for thirty years, so that the third generation will have the good fruit of prosperity, strength, and happiness."</p>
<h3>The National Government Committee Will Hold a Meeting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The National Government Committee is scheduled to hold a meeting in the National Government Auditorium on the 3rd.</p>
<h3>The Chairman Hosts All Legislators for a Banquet, With Many Encouragements for the Work of the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] Chairman Chiang hosted all legislators for a tea party at the Lizhi Society at 5:00 PM on the 1st. More than 50 people attended, including Sun Ke. First, legislator Li Qingmo asked the Chairman to deliver a speech. The Chairman stood up and spoke, saying that during the eight years of the War of Resistance, the colleagues of the Legislative Yuan worked hard. During his time in Chongqing, he had no time to meet with everyone often, so he took this opportunity to express his condolences. Furthermore, the work of the Legislative Yuan this year will be busier than in previous years because all the laws for implementing the constitution must be completed this year, so he hopes that all colleagues will work hard to achieve this goal. Refreshments were then served and the event ended at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The Constitutional Government Promotion Association Can Be Established Within the Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] Shao Lizi told reporters on the evening of the 1st that the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association will be established within this month, and the organization of the association is still being discussed step by step. Also, regarding the rumors that Hong Lanyou will be appointed as the chairman of the propaganda committee of the association, Shao said that he had not heard of it.</p>
<h3>The Democratic League Hosts People From All Walks of Life, Hoping People From All Walks of Life Will Participate as Members</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] At 2:00 PM on the 1st, the Democratic League hosted people from the city's industrial, commercial, and cultural circles at the YMCA. Chairman Zhang Lan attended, with over 200 people. In his report, Zhang Dongsun emphasized the independence and intermediary nature of the Democratic League and hoped that people from all walks of life would participate to realize a "true and broad" democracy. After the meeting, a reporter interviewed a key member of the Democratic League and asked about the expansion of the organization and the work policy. According to him, most of the members of the Democratic League two years ago were from the education and cultural circles, but now many government officials and people from the industrial and commercial circles have joined. In the future, the absorption of members will extend to all walks of life, but the Democratic League does not have an army, so very few soldiers join the league. As for the work policy in the future, in addition to strengthening the internal forces, they will not give up the opportunity for mediation at any time. However, in view of the repeated failures in the past, resulting in a loss of credibility, they will not act rashly unless they are confident.</p>
<h3>Pritchard is Guilty, May Be Sentenced to One to Three Months</h3>

The first charge may be sentenced to three months in prison, and the second charge will be sentenced to one month, and he will be expelled from the Marine Corps, but the final verdict will be decided by Washington.</p>
<h3>The Chairman Hosts Government Officials for a Banquet to Exchange Views on the Current Situation, The Social Democratic Party Has Not Yet Proposed a Plan to Reorganize the Government</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] Chairman Chiang hosted government officials Wang Chonghui, Shao Lizi, Sun Ke, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Lisheng, Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, and Chen Lifu at his official residence at 7:30 PM on the 1st. During the banquet, they extensively exchanged views on the reorganization of the government and various regulations in the process of implementing the constitution, such as various election laws. The reorganization of the government is currently underway actively. Wu Tiecheng, Lei Zhen, and others are still in Shanghai, working on this matter. The conversation ended at around 9:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Social Democratic Party has not yet proposed a specific plan for the reorganization of the government. No meeting was held on the 1st, but opinions were exchanged privately. According to a key member, if a meeting is not held next Monday, this matter will be brought up for discussion at the regular meeting on Wednesday. The problem now is not the principle but the details. The Social Democratic Party ultimately hopes to play a significant role after joining the government, rather than just taking office. It is expected that this matter will not be delayed for too long. The rumor that it must be postponed until after the foreign ministers' meeting is completely inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Last Year's Christmas Day Plane Crash: Full Text of the Political Council's Investigation Report; Analysis of Responsibility Issues and Suggestions for Improvement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Standing Committee of the Political Council previously dispatched Jiang Yong, Zheng Kuiyi, and Yin Shuxian to Shanghai to investigate the truth of the Shanghai plane crash on December 25th of last year. They arrived in Shanghai on January 8th and completed their investigation. The results were submitted in a written report to the 14th meeting of the council on the 31st. It was resolved to submit it to the government for consideration and action. The plane crash attracted national attention, and the investigation by the Political Council was highly regarded by all parties. The full text of the report first details the investigation process in Shanghai from January 8th to 15th, followed by three items: (1) The Truth of the Accident, (2) Responsibility Issues, and (3) Improvement Suggestions. The full text of the report concerning these three items is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Truth of the Accident</p>
<p>(1) Aircraft No. 140 was a C-47 type, coming from Chongqing, stopping in Hankou, and then taking off again, flying to Shanghai via Nanjing. Aircraft No. 115 was a C-46 type, coming from Chongqing, stopping in Hankou, and then taking off directly to Shanghai. Aircraft No. 48 was a C-1 type, taking off from Chongqing at 8:40 AM on the 25th, arriving in Hankou at 12:15 PM, continuing its flight from Hankou at 1:10 PM, and arriving in Nanjing at 3:00 PM, continuing its flight to Shanghai at 3:25 PM. (2) After each aircraft took off, according to the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) weather forecast, Shanghai and Nanjing had similar conditions, i.e., from 11:00 AM to 5:00 PM, the cloud ceiling was 2,000 to 1,000 feet, or descending to 500 feet, and visibility was one mile to half a mile. Normally, take-offs and landings require a cloud ceiling of 300 feet and visibility of one mile. Beyond these limits, the airfield would be closed. On that day, Aircraft No. 140 arrived in Nanjing at 4:38 PM, Aircraft No. 115 arrived in Nanjing at 4:02 PM, and Aircraft No. 48 arrived in Nanjing at 3:20 PM. Except for Aircraft No. 48, which experienced normal weather passing through Nanjing, Aircraft No. 115 experienced changing weather in Nanjing and was on a direct flight to Shanghai, so it was permissible to fly to Shanghai. However, when Aircraft No. 140 arrived in Nanjing, the weather had deteriorated, and it attempted to land unsuccessfully, so it continued its direct flight to Shanghai. Aircraft No. 140 arrived in Shanghai airspace at 6:40 PM, Aircraft No. 115 arrived in Shanghai at 5:10 PM, and Aircraft No. 48 arrived in Shanghai airspace at 5:40 PM. The weather had already deteriorated. The Shanghai airfield had been closed at 4:30 PM. When Aircraft No. 140 arrived in Nanjing, it telegraphed the Shanghai company at 4:00 PM to inquire whether it could fly to Shanghai for landing. It received a reply at 4:17 PM that it was not advisable to fly to Shanghai after dark. At 5:10 PM, it was instructed to fly at an altitude of 7,500 meters. Aircraft No. 115, apart from contacting Longhua by telegram at 3:35 PM, had no further telegram communications. Aircraft No. 48, due to normal weather, followed the usual procedure and flew to Shanghai. (3) According to Wu Ci, head of the flight crew of China National Aviation Corporation, Aircraft Nos. 115 and 140 were both permitted by the Jiangwan Control Tower to land at Longhua. Except that Aircraft No. 140 had insufficient fuel and spent three-quarters of an hour flying over Longhua Airport, it crash-landed blindly at 7:54 PM outside the runway fork of Longhua Airport. Aircraft No. 115 circled over Shanghai for about four hours before crash-landing blindly at 9:29 PM, one mile south of Longhua Airport. Aircraft No. 48 was permitted by the Jiangwan Control Tower to use radar for landing and crashed at 8:10 PM outside the Jiangwan Airport, one mile from the Zhang family's house. (4) Aircraft No. 140 carried a total of 27 passengers and three crew members. After the crash, 22 passengers and three crew members died. The remaining five passengers are still recovering in Zhongshan Hospital. Aircraft No. 115 carried a total of 38 passengers and three crew members. After the crash, 32 passengers and two crew members died. One person was uninjured, and seven are still in Zhongshan Hospital. Aircraft No. 48 carried a total of seven passengers and four crew members, totaling eleven people. All passengers and crew survived.</p>
<p>Responsibility Issues</p>
<p>Upon investigation, Director Li of the Ministry of Transportation promised to send the entire investigation of the plane crash for reference. Furthermore, Dai Anguo, Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Transportation, also promised to send another copy of the investigation report for reference. However, more than ten days have passed and it has not yet been sent, the inside story of which is incomprehensible. Regarding the responsibility aspect, based on what our colleagues personally investigated, we provide four points for discussion:</p>
<p>Since the establishment of civil aviation companies in our country, people from all walks of life have expressed their concerns. Summarizing the main points, it is nothing more than flight crews smuggling and engaging in corruption, neglecting their duties, and being arrogant, leading to frequent occurrences of fuel theft, overloading, poor communication, and improper management. Looking at the responses of the two companies to this incident and the investigation, the China Central Air Transport Corporation's (CCATC) responsibility seems lighter, while the China National Aviation Corporation's responsibility seems heavier. CCATC's Aircraft No. 48 crashed at Jiangwan. If there is responsibility, apart from the pilot himself, it should be attributed to the personnel of Jiangwan Airport, which is controlled by the U.S. military. Moreover, that company seems to pay closer attention to both major and minor issues. For example, when the weather in Shanghai suddenly changed, it ordered Aircraft Nos. 46 and 43 to stop flying to Shanghai at 4:10 PM. Regarding the problem of negligence of underground personnel in Qingdao mentioned by Representative Li Dongyuan, it investigated and reported the matter within three days. Conversely, China National Aviation Corporation did not order its aircraft to stop flying after 4:00 PM that afternoon. Although its report mentioned a telegram from the Longhua radio station indicating a possible flight suspension, the fact that it could not provide a definitive instruction is a fact. Furthermore, regarding the negligence of underground personnel in Qingdao mentioned by Representative Li Dongyuan, it has remained unanswered to this day. In addition, when our colleagues inquired about the deceased, the words of the general manager and others were evasive, which proves that the personnel of China National Aviation Corporation are usually not cautious in their self-cultivation and are not thorough in their work. Therefore, in this accident, the authorities of China National Aviation Corporation cannot escape criticism. This is the first point.</p>
<p>Weather forecasting is the most important guide for flight personnel. However, the weather forecasts from the meteorological stations that day, from 11:00 AM to 5:00 PM, were all above the limits for flight take-offs and landings. However, after 4:00 PM, not only did the weather in Shanghai deteriorate, but the weather in Nanjing also changed suddenly. Therefore, in this accident, the meteorological personnel should bear part of the responsibility. Otherwise, if the meteorological equipment is inadequate and the meteorological observers are insufficient, the Ministry of Transportation and China National Aviation Corporation should not shirk their responsibility. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Whether the airfield equipment is complete or not directly affects the safety of flight landings. Longhua Airport is uneven and filled with puddles. The company authorities did not cover it with sand and soil in peacetime, but after the accident, they attributed it to financial difficulties. The fact that Aircraft No. 140 crashed at the fork and perished may have been caused by the uneven airfield, which is possible. As for the surrounding buildings being obstacles, it is not the real cause of this accident. This is the third point.</p>
<p>Both companies have been able to handle the aftermath of this incident thoughtfully. However, the compensation for company personnel is better than that for passengers, which should be improved. The deaths of company personnel are indeed regrettable, but they cannot be said to be without responsibility. Conversely, the deaths of passengers are clearly without any responsibility. If the compensation is significantly different, it does not seem very reasonable. Moreover, to increase the company's caution, it is better to increase the compensation for passengers and provide equal treatment. This is the fourth point.</p>
<p>Improvement Suggestions</p>
<p>(1) Aviation regulations should be formulated promptly to unify the command of flight navigation and strengthen the management of flight crews. (2) Military airfields should allow civilian aircraft to land during peacetime. (3) More weather observation instruments should be added, and the number of weather stations and observers should be increased. (4) Airfields should be modified, and attention should be paid to adding and lengthening runways. (5) China Central Air Transport Corporation and China National Aviation Corporation should cooperate thoroughly and assist each other to develop the civil aviation industry. (6) The performance of aircraft should be inspected more thoroughly. Aircraft that have exceeded their service life should not be used again. (7) Seasonal climate is unpredictable. Before accurate forecasting technology has reached its best, all flights should be suspended when the weather is unfavorable. (8) Ways should be found to transport the remains of the deceased passengers for burial in their hometowns. (9) China National Aviation Corporation should be thoroughly rectified, and the personnel responsible for each accident should be severely punished. (10) All civilian aircraft, regardless of nationality, flying in our country's airspace should be subject to the jurisdiction of the Civil Aviation Administration. (11) The compensation for aircraft accidents should be revised. Equal regulations should be made for the compensation for all flight crew members and passengers.</p>

<h3>This Year's Steel Production: Sun Yueqi Estimates 230,000 Tons; The National Resources Commission Will Plan Sales</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st] Sun Yueqi stated: Under this year's steel production plan, in addition to their own use, the steel plants and mines in Northeast and North China can supply 230,000 tons of finished steel products, including 60,000 tons of iron. According to customs import statistics from before the war in 1934, 1935 and 1936, the annual amount was 600,000 tons. Currently, domestic transportation has not recovered, and some factories have not yet started production. It is estimated that an annual demand of 300,000 tons will be sufficient to meet needs, which is already [not quite legible]. In terms of steel prices, although foreign steel is cheaper, the price per ton, including transportation costs, has reached around 3 million yuan, while domestic steel costs about 800,000 yuan per ton, so there should be no problem with the market. Currently, the steel industry in the Northeast is still the mainstay, accounting for three-quarters of the total. Recently, the President of the Executive Yuan allocated 20 billion yuan to support production at the Anshan Iron and Steel Works. North China accounts for one-quarter of the national total, with Shijingshan being the main producer. Because it is currently using good iron ore from Pangjiabao and coal from Jingxing, [production in] Pingjin has not yet been able to develop greatly. In Central China, the government will use Japanese reparations in the form of industrial equipment to re-establish the Daye Iron Mine, which may be completed within five years. Regarding the dismantling of Japanese steel equipment, Nanjing should make a decision soon. Sun also mentioned that he will soon go to the Northeast again, and to Datong to inspect the situation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 1st] Sun Yueqi, Deputy Chairman of the National Resources Commission, said: In order to encourage industrial development and save foreign exchange, the Executive Yuan has established an Import Management Committee. The National Resources Commission has also formulated a comprehensive plan for this year's steel production in the Northeast and North China and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval. The steel production conference held in Peiping lasted a week and concluded successfully on the 30th. Detailed discussions were held on the equipment of each factory, the current production level, the types, quantities, market conditions, business organization, sales prices, and the transportation of raw materials and finished products. This year's production volume, excluding the factory's own use, can supply about 230,000 tons of finished steel products. The North China Steel Company's three plants in Shijingshan, Tangshan, and Tianjin have already started production, except for the Tangshan and Tianjin plants. Regarding the Yihua iron ore and coking coal required by the Shijingshan Huai Iron Plant, an agreement has been reached with the Pingjin Railway Bureau, and transportation will begin in March and April. Therefore, the Shijingshan Iron Smelting Plant will also be able to start production by July at the latest. In the Northeast, the Anshan Iron and Steel Works has partially resumed operations for the steel rolling section at the end of last year, supplying some steel products. It is now actively being repaired and will soon be fully operational. The steelmaking sector is scheduled to resume operations in April and May. The blast furnaces were severely damaged by the Communist forces and will not be repaired until August of this year, when production can begin. The special steel produced in Benxi and Fushun is of excellent quality and has already resumed production. This year's products can supply the entire country with surplus. The National Resources Commission also plans to establish a business organization in Shanghai to coordinate sales and make legal regulations on prices. At a time when steel prices in Shanghai are chaotic, if the commission's products can be transported in a stable flow, it can have a stabilizing effect. However, the success or failure of this steel production plan in North China and the Northeast is closely related to whether railway transportation can cooperate. Especially in the Northeast, where there is a shortage of vehicles, and the amount of raw materials and finished products to be transported is large, the problem is even more serious. At this steel conference, the issue of vehicle replenishment was also discussed in detail. The Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant of the National Resources Commission has decided to manufacture 800 new vehicles this year in order to increase railway transportation capacity. However, all the required steel materials must be specially supplied by the Anshan Iron and Steel Works. In addition, some vehicle parts must be manufactured by the Shenyang Machinery Plant of the National Resources Commission.</p>
<h3>Japanese Robbed Our Copper Coins and Nickel Coins; Discovered in Nagasaki and Other Places; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Prepares to Negotiate for Return</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently received a telegram from our representative delegation in Japan stating: A large number of our country's copper coins and nickel coins have been discovered stockpiled in Nagasaki, Osaka, and other places in Japan. There is no doubt that these were looted and confiscated from our people by the Japanese army during its occupation of our country. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent official letters to various provinces and cities, requesting them to quickly investigate the quantity and evidence of losses suffered by the people of each province and city during the Japanese occupation, so that after collection, it can send a letter to the Executive Yuan's Committee on Reparations from Japan to negotiate with Japan for their return.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Japanese Reparations: We Demand Half the Allocation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st] Industrial circles report: The US government has authorized MacArthur to handle 20% of Japanese industrial equipment reparations first (the total is between 7 million and 12 million tons), and a decision should be made soon. It is not yet known whether our country's request to allocate 50% of the first batch of industrial equipment will be successful. It is reported that the five-member committee representing our country in handling industrial equipment reparations has been appointed. If China's request is successful, it will obtain 600,000 tons of industrial equipment. How to transport and reconfigure these machines is a difficult and arduous task. This year's transportation will be tasked with dismantling and transporting [the equipment] to Japanese ports for boarding, but we will be responsible for it after it is loaded. It is estimated that transportation costs alone will require 2 trillion legal tender and 39 million US dollars. At the same time, our ports do not have cranes capable of unloading 140-ton loads, which must be urgently equipped. If domestic transportation and deployment work are added, it may take several years to complete.</p>

<h3>Dim Lights in the Dacheng Hall: Debate Concludes in the Ding Mocun Case; The Capital High Court Scheduled to Announce Verdict on the Afternoon of the 8th</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The traitor Ding Mocun case has concluded its debate after nine and a half hours of day and night long-term trial by the Capital High Court. The verdict is scheduled to be announced at 3:00 PM on the 8th. According to court president Jin Shiding's announcement in court, the court will reopen the debate if it deems it necessary.</p>
<p>The Fourth Criminal Court of the Capital High Court interrogated the traitor Ding on the 1st, with court president Jin Shiding serving as the presiding judge, and judges Ge Zhaomou and Shentu Chen as associate judges. Prosecutor Chen Lizu also appeared in court in the afternoon. The traitor Ding was wearing a blue tight robe and carrying a large leather bag full of files. His face looked more haggard than before. After going to court, he often held his chest with his hand and coughed occasionally. He once used his weakness and illness as an excuse, claiming that he was weak and had no strength to speak, and requested a postponement of the trial. However, when it came to self-praise, he stood in front of a kerosene lamp and spoke eloquently for as long as two hours. The Dacheng Hall was dark all around, and the lights were dim. All 500-600 people in the audience held their breath and listened to his self-praise and self-admiration, making people recall the scene of the Beijing opera night trial of Pan Hong, which made their hair stand on end.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy aspects of today's trial were the two cases of Ding's murder of Yu Hua, the former president of the Shanghai Special District High Court, and Zheng Pingru, an underground worker of the Military Intelligence Bureau. Mrs. Yu Hua also appeared in court to testify, stating that Yu Hua was shot on the morning of November 23rd of the 28th year of the Republic of China at 9:00 AM. When his coachman chased after the car, he saw the murderer escape in car number "7841." That car was found again in front of the 76th Division at 3:00 or 4:00 PM that afternoon, and Ding was the head of that intelligence agency, so Ding should bear full responsibility. Mrs. Yu Hua also pointed out that after the case occurred, Zheng Pingru sarcastically asked Ding, when he was very happy, why he killed this honest official. Ding replied that he had previously sent someone to order him to join the "He Yun," but Yu did not know the situation, so he killed a chicken to scare the monkeys, and warned Zheng Ruwei (Zheng Tiejiang, head of the Criminal Court of the Suzhou District Court) that he should also know the situation and join, and should know that the "72 Calling Number" was not without people.</p>
<p>Ding made sophistry about the Yu case, first claiming: He was forced to join the 76th Division, without courage or power, all the power was in the hands of Wu Shibaobao and others, and he himself was also under control, let alone killing people. He pointed out that at that time, Wang Jingwei had not yet formed a government, and there seemed to be no need to kill a judge. At the same time, there were at least four enemy intelligence agencies in Shanghai at that time, not necessarily referring to the 76th Division. Finally, he pointed out that the car number pointed out by Mrs. Yu differed before and after. Since Mrs. Yu pointed out that Wang Shaofu was the owner, the court should investigate this active evidence.</p>
<p>Regarding the tragic murder of Zheng Pingru by the traitor Ding, the court presented the written statements of Pan Sansheng and Zheng Pingru, etc., interrogated by the Shanghai court. The court clearly stated that the traitor Ding was responsible, and read the letter sent home by Zheng when she was in the 76th Division as evidence. After receiving the letter, Ding repeatedly looked at the envelope, paying particular attention to the stamp and the seal. Finally, he carefully looked at the pseudonym and the date. His expression while looking at the letter made it clear at a glance that he was a veteran special agent. The traitor Ding and his defense lawyer's response to the case was that the letter had no year or sending address, and it could not be proven that it was written by Zheng. Ding also falsely accused Zheng's birth mother of being Japanese, grew up in Japan, and had a relationship with the Japanese intelligence agency before joining the underground work, and also had a connection with the Japanese Communist Party. The killer was Japanese, and there were many involved in the deportation. As for the poisoning of the hands because his request was not fulfilled, he flatly denied it.</p>
<p>When Ding was tried today, he repeatedly stated about his service in Zhejiang, claiming that this move saved the lives of at least 10 million people. He was quite boastful and frequently said that this was not "self-praise," but only "explaining his heart." And imitating Zhou Fohai's tone, he said: "Everything that I, Ding Mocun, did can be said to be colluding with our country and resisting Japan." He looked at the audience hopefully, hoping that "the court and society can uphold justice."</p>
<p>Prosecutor Chen Shengchi sternly rebuked Ding's various fallacies, believing that for the sake of national law and justice, this kind of fickle villain should be severely sanctioned. As for Ding's claim that he saved the lives of 10 million people in Zhejiang, he also believed that "small merits are not enough to cover up great faults," because Ding's various actions hindered the War of Resistance and harmed 450 million compatriots. The cases of Ding's murder of Yu Hua, etc., all happened during Ding's tenure as the head of the 76th Division, and Ding cannot shirk his responsibility.</p>
<p>Today's criminal court started at 10:00 AM and adjourned for a lunch break. The hearing was reopened and ended at 9:30 PM.</p>

<p>Nanchang Designated as a Prostitution Ban Demonstration Zone</p>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 1st] The Jiangxi Administrative Conference held its opening ceremony on the 1st morning. Wang Lingji delivered the opening address, stating that the biggest shortcomings preventing Jiangxi's administration from achieving expected results were: (1) lack of talent, (2) financial difficulties, leading to low competence and efficiency of staff.

<h3>Beijing Opera Circle in Beiping Commemorates Li Shifang</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 1st] The Beiping opera circle held a memorial service at Zhongshan Park on the morning of the 1st for Li Shifang, one of the "Four Little Famous Dan" who died in a plane crash. His teacher, Shang Xiaoyun, presided over the ceremony. More than 200 people from the opera circle attended. Li's parents, wife, and daughter mourned deeply. Shang Xiaoyun expressed regret for the demise of this successor to the Mei school, saying that the "Four Little Famous Dan" now lack their leader and no one can replace Li Shifang. Li's father stated that Mei Lanfang may perform an unpaid benefit performance for him in Shanghai in March, but Beiping has not yet indicated anything. When asked about his opinion on Mei and Cheng performing together in Shanghai, Shang said that Cheng had acknowledged Mei as his teacher in the seventh year of the Republic, so it does not contravene the ethics of mentorship, but it's okay if it is considered a business transaction. Furthermore, Beiping's entertainment tax has been reduced from 60% to 25%, which is celebrated by the opera world. However, the situation where more than half of the tickets are patronized by military and police despite suppressive measures remains a major pain point for the Beiping opera circle.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Political and Labor Unrest in Japan</h3>
<p>After the Yoshida Cabinet in Japan submitted its resignation on the 28th of last month amidst nationwide calls for its downfall, it was ordered by the Emperor to form a new cabinet. Although Prime Minister Yoshida intended to unite the three major parties – the Social Democratic Party, the Liberal Party, and the Progressive Party – to form a unified democratic government for Japan, the Social Democratic Party's firm refusal to participate in the new cabinet forced him to abandon his attempts to bring them on board and instead form a coalition cabinet of the Liberal and Progressive parties. Although the new cabinet was established yesterday and its list of members has been submitted to the Emperor for approval, the political unrest in Japan is still raging. Not only are the general public continuing their campaign to overthrow the cabinet, but also members of parliament have expressed deep dissatisfaction with Prime Minister Yoshida's method of selecting cabinet members, deeming it inconsistent with democratic principles.</p>
<p>Many difficult problems still lie ahead for the new Yoshida Cabinet, something that Prime Minister Yoshida himself is well aware of. After the "National Assembly to Overthrow the Cabinet" was held by national people's groups on December 17th of last year, Yoshida himself understood the difficulties of Japanese politics, especially the current economic crisis. Simply reforming the cabinet by including some members of the Progressive and Liberal parties would be like changing the soup without changing the ingredients, and would not break through Japan's current economic predicament. It would require the participation of the Social Democratic Party, which is backed by the working class, to bring a fresh perspective and weather the current crisis. Therefore, after his cabinet submitted its resignation, he consulted with the leaders of the Social Democratic and Progressive parties to form a unified coalition government. The Social Democratic Party consistently insisted on its three demands: (1) to replace Finance Minister Ishibashi to thoroughly change his fiscal policy; (2) to require the People's Cooperative Party to participate in the new cabinet at the same time; and (3) to add Suzuki and Kato, two members of the Social Democratic Party's left wing, to the party's list, while reducing one or two right-wing members from the list. These three demands were not acceptable to Yoshida, so the plan for a coalition government had to be abandoned, and another way out had to be sought.</p>
<p>Looking at the composition of the new Yoshida Cabinet, the Liberal Party's position in the cabinet has become even stronger than before. Most of the added non-partisan members are also conservatives. Whether this kind of cabinet is welcomed by the majority of the Japanese people at present is, of course, a very serious question, especially the reappointment of Finance Minister Ishibashi, which is most unpopular with the general public. The Social Democratic Party's refusal to participate in the cabinet has gained even more support from the working class, making workers even more eager to participate in the movement to overthrow the cabinet. Therefore, more than three million Japanese workers plan to take advantage of the breakdown of the final negotiations between the Japanese government and representatives of the public servants' association to implement the largest strike in world history on February 1st. If the Japanese government and the Allied control authorities do not find a way to prevent this unprecedented strike wave in advance, the harm it will cause will be worse than a volcanic eruption or other types of disasters. Therefore, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, who is responsible for controlling Japan, had to take high-pressure measures and order Japanese workers not to strike.</p>
<p>We have read MacArthur's statement on this matter: "The reason I have taken this measure is to prevent fatal damage to the public welfare. Japanese society is already under Allied control due to its defeat in the war. Its cities are desolate, its industries are at a standstill, and most of its people are hovering on the brink of starvation. A strike will disrupt transportation and communication; it will prevent the movement of coal, inevitably causing industry to come to a complete standstill. This will plunge the Japanese people into disaster." From this, we can also get a glimpse of the actual situation in Japan today. In the past, labor unrest in Japan was instigated by the Japanese Communist Party, but the Yoshida Cabinet often turned a deaf ear to the demands of the working class, without any consideration, and instead frequently adopted high-handed policies. The greater the pressure, the greater the backlash. Therefore, the Yoshida Cabinet cannot escape considerable responsibility for the spread and expansion of labor unrest in Japan. As things stand now, labor unrest in Japan is becoming increasingly difficult to control, and MacArthur is still taking high-handed policies and prohibiting Japanese workers from striking. Japanese labor unions have no choice but to abide by MacArthur's orders and reconsider their decision to strike. If Japanese workers insist on their own views and must carry out the strike, the consequences are truly unimaginable, and Japan will fall into an even more chaotic state.</p>
<p>Recalling when the Allied forces began controlling Japan after Japan surrendered? They clearly announced that the goal of controlling Japan was to put Japanese politics on the path to democracy, and to make it one of the peace-loving countries in the international community, no longer threatening the peace of the Far East. From then until today, nearly a year and a half has passed. Looking at MacArthur's achievements in controlling Japan, and thinking about whether Japanese politics has embarked on the path to democratization? We really dare not be overly optimistic about the future of Japanese politics. At present, Japan must obey MacArthur's orders in everything, so the change of cabinets is either Yoshida of the Liberal Party or Shidehara of the Progressive Party. The constant changes ultimately fail to satisfy the Japanese people, forcing them to stand up and hold anti-cabinet movements, shouting slogans to overthrow the cabinet. MacArthur disregards Japanese public opinion and insists on adopting high-handed policies, attempting to ensure that political power in Japan is forever held in the hands of conservatives. Is this policy consistent with his control objectives? MacArthur really needs to reconsider.</p>
<p>In short, today's Japan, whether politically, economically, or socially, has shown signs of turmoil. The political and labor unrest that is currently erupting seems unlikely to be resolved by the likes of Yoshida and Shidehara.</p>

(12) Except when necessary to prepare official residences to avoid expenses, finding hotels should be paid by the government and not provided by the local area.</p>
<h3>Taihu Bandit Suppression Headquarters Abolished; Command Post Established to Transfer Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 1st] The Wuxi Command Post of the Capital Garrison Command believes that the remaining bandits in Taihu Lake have not yet been eliminated, and the bandit suppression in the border areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui is also expanding. It is inevitable that fleeing bandits will flow into the lake. Although the Taihu Bandit Suppression Headquarters is responsible for preventing this, it is feared that the organizational structure is divided and the command system belongs to different entities, making it difficult to achieve the expected results. A command was issued on the 1st to abolish the Taihu Bandit Suppression Command Headquarters and establish a Suzhou Command Post instead, which is under the command of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Border Bandit Suppression Command. The location remains in Mudu, and Colonel Liu Hongde is appointed as the director of the post to continue suppressing lake bandits and divide responsibilities as follows: The lakeside areas of Yixing, Changxing, and Wujiang counties are the responsibility of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Border Command. The lakeside areas of Wujin, Caoqiao, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Wujiang are fully the responsibility of the Suzhou Command Post.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Southern Chemical Plant No Longer to Be Sold by Tender; Allocated to Senior Industrial School for Practice</h3>

<h3>Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi Border Area Command Abolished</h3>

<h3>Su-Meng Postal Route Restored</h3>
<p>[Our Suxian Dispatch] The mail from this county to Mengcheng used to be delivered directly by messengers every day. Later, due to frequent bandit activity along the way, the post office changed to relaying it through Huaiyuan via Bengbu for safety reasons, which inevitably caused delays. Now, the Su-Meng Highway has been repaired, and the bandit atmosphere has gradually been cleared. The Suxian Post Office has applied for and been approved to resume the Su-Meng shift work, which will be directly delivered from today. The Beijing-Shanghai newspapers can arrive in the counties of northern Anhui every other day.</p>

<h3>Suzhou Yongming Yarn Factory Suffers Misfortune</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch] The Yongming Yarn Factory outside Suzhou's Changmen Gate, with about a thousand spindles, has been quite profitable in recent years due to the strong yarn market.

<h3>Communist Troops Destroy the Bo-Shang Highway; People of Bo County Suffer Greatly; Pledge to Support the National Army to Maintain Transportation</h3>
<p>[Our Taixian Dispatch] The Tai-Shang Highway is an important route for the transportation of industrial and commercial goods and mail to and from Hao County. It is also the lifeline of the county and is closely related to the lives of the people. Since the Lunar New Year, large numbers of communist troops have occupied the middle section of the highway, from Zhangji to Songyanji, and Shenliuhang. They have spared no effort to destroy bridges, loot roads, shoot businessmen, or obstruct the passage of mail. The brutal behavior of the communists is extremely rampant. The merchants and people of this county have suffered greatly, and the national postal service has also been destroyed. This is intolerable by national law. At a time when the county is surrounded by communist troops and as dangerous as eggs piled up, the trampling of this highway has put our people on the road to death. Therefore, all the people of the county are filled with anger and indignation, vowing to support the national army to maintain the lifeline of transportation and protect the safety of commerce and mail.</p>
<h3>Taixing's Important Town of Huangqiao; County Government Establishes Office</h3>
<p>[Our Taixing Dispatch] Since the anti-Japanese war, Huangqiao Town in the county has suffered several tragic robberies, resulting in extremely heavy local losses and greatly damaged vitality. Although it has now been recovered by the national army, most of the townships are still controlled by communist troops. The town is located in the central area of ​​the four counties of Tai, Tai, Ru, and Jing, and is the hub of north-south water and land transportation. The position is important, and the government also attaches great importance to it. Provincial Chairman Wang Maogong has visited and inspected it several times, and dispatched a large number of troops to defend and suppress the bandits, in order to eliminate the bandit atmosphere as soon as possible. In order to strengthen administrative efficiency and facilitate command, County Chief Wu recently established an office in Huangqiao and dispatched personnel from the government office to coordinate and work. Wu also lives in the town, coordinating with the national army to carry out military and political work.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin Buries Loyal Corpses</h3>

<h3>Jiaping Highway Temporarily Closed</h3>
<p>More than 30 Bridges Waiting to be Repaired</p>
<p>[Our Jiaxing Dispatch] The Jiaping Highway, which is 29 kilometers long from Jiaxing to Pinghu, has more than 30 bridges. Due to years of disrepair, they have collapsed and are extremely damaged. It is very dangerous to drive over them. After Director Pi Jian of the Construction Department inspected Jiaxing, he ordered the Transportation Department to transfer the Hangzhou Business Office to temporarily suspend traffic on the road to avoid danger. On the one hand, he actively planned repairs, and the required funds are planned to be used as collateral loans from the banking sector for the road rent obtained.</p>
<h3>Qishuyan Power Plant</h3>
<p>Planning to Build a Power Plant in Jiangyin</p>
<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch] The Qishuyan Power Plant purchased 400 mu of rice fields in Wangting in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, preparing to build a large power plant to supply electricity to the two counties of Su and Xi. Later, it was suspended due to the war. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, all kinds of factories must be restored, and the demand for electricity is very high. The power plant plans to build a power plant, but the location in Wangting is still inconvenient. It is best to be close to the Yangtze River area, which is more convenient for transporting fuel. It has now dispatched personnel to survey addresses along the Yangtze River in Jiangyin and start construction, so as to transport electricity to the three counties of Cheng, Xi, and Su as soon as possible, which can increase production.</p>
<p>[Our Jiangyin Dispatch] Yangzi River Electric Company plans to build a large-scale power station in this county. In November last year, it sent personnel to Cheng to inspect.

The company will send personnel to Cheng in the next few days to discuss everything with Commander Kong.</p>

<h3>The Relocation of the Infectious Disease Hospital is Too Remote</h3>
<p>We are workers at the Municipal Second Infectious Disease Hospital. Recently, our hospital is being moved from Haiyan to Baziqiao, as reported in the newspapers. This matter concerns the interests of every citizen in the city. We have always admired your newspaper as the voice of the people. Now, we would like to say a few words from the perspective of the citizens, and raise three points, hoping to have them published:</p>
<p>(1) The hospital is too remote. Most infectious diseases are acute. If a person living in the [blank] district contracts an acute infectious disease and has to hire a car to be taken to Baziqiao, it will take two or three hours on the way. The condition may worsen and lives may be lost.</p>
<p>(2) The transportation is inconvenient. An infectious disease hospital should be located in a place with convenient transportation for the temporary purchase of medicines and equipment. Baziqiao is located in a remote area and lacks public transportation. People may hesitate to accompany patients or because of the inconvenience of going back and forth. Just look at the First Infectious Disease Hospital, because it is located on the Tiantong Road, which is less convenient than Haiyan Road, the number of patients is far less than the Second Infectious Disease Hospital. This proves that convenient transportation is also very important.</p>
<p>(3) The hospital is too small. Patient isolation is a very important task of an infectious disease hospital, which can only be done with spacious hospital buildings. Currently, our hospital averages around 80 or 90 patients every day. Especially during the cholera epidemic last year, the number of patients increased to more than 200 and the corridors were filled with patients until there was no room left. Shanghai, a huge city, only has two municipal infectious disease hospitals, which should be expanded urgently. Now, moving it to the small Baziqiao hospital building is going against the needs of reality.</p>
<p>The above three points are entirely for the benefit of the public. We hope that social elites will provide support. (Medical Staff of Municipal Second Infectious Disease Hospital)</p>
<h3>How to Place Art Teachers and Junior High School Students?</h3>
<p>The Municipal Art Normal School has been resolved by the City Council to be merged. According to reports, the normal school students will be merged into the Xinlu Normal School. However, there are 300 students in the junior high school department, accounting for six-sevenths of the total number of students in the school. How will they be placed? There is no mention in the reports, and there is no news from the school either. The schools are about to open and classes are about to start. We believe that the authorities will definitely not allow our 300 students to drop out of school halfway, and will properly arrange for them. We ask all councilors to understand that the families of the students who applied for the junior high school department of the school mostly live nearby and their economic resources are limited. We earnestly hope that a municipal ordinary boys' middle school will be established at the original site of the Art Normal School so that we will not drop out of school and have the opportunity to enter the senior high school department. At the same time, we ask the City Council and the Education Bureau to announce the arrangements for the more than 300 students as soon as possible to comfort the students and parents' hopes and benefit the citizens not a little!

<h3>Tensions Rise in Palestine: British Government Orders Swift Evacuation of Women and Children, Launching a Precursor to an Anti-Jewish Terror Campaign</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Jerusalem, 31st] The British government in Palestine today took drastic measures to ensure safety, ordering the evacuation of all British women and children back to their home country and relocating all government personnel to secure locations. According to a proclamation by the Palestinian government, this order is based on the recently promulgated emergency defense regulations, which empower the British Commissioner for Palestine to evacuate unnecessary non-Palestinian residents to facilitate public safety or maintain order. The term "non-Palestinian residents" likely refers to the Commissioner, who, if he decides to proceed, will also order the evacuation of Americans and other foreign residents in Palestine.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 31st] The execution of Jewish man Groener, sentenced to death for attacking a police station, has been postponed again for 48 hours. Groener has stated that he refuses to appeal to any British court. The recent tensions in Palestine are due to the Irgun party's retaliation for his death sentence.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 31st] All British women, children, and non-essential civilians in Palestine have been ordered to prepare to leave Palestine within ten days. London believes that this measure is a precursor to an unprecedented anti-terrorism campaign to be launched by British authorities in the region. The debate over the volatile situation in Palestine in the British House of Commons began hours after High Commissioner for Palestine, Sir Cunningham, issued this order.</p>
<h3>British Merchants in Palestine Protest Evacuation Order</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] A London broadcast on the 1st stated that the evacuation of British women and children from Palestine has commenced and will be completed within 48 hours.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 31st] After Cunningham ordered the preparation for the evacuation of British women and children from Palestine, the British Chamber of Commerce in Palestine sent telegrams of protest to its own government and Conservative Party leader Winston Churchill, arguing that this was tantamount to succumbing to the intimidation of terrorists. They pointed out that many Britons have been operating in Palestine for many years, and therefore, their decision to stay or leave should be a matter of free choice.</p>
<h3>Heated Debate in the British House of Commons: Churchill Roars Again, Argues that Britain and the U.S. Should Co-manage Palestine, Accuses the Government of Steering Towards Shame</h3>
<p>[United Press International, London, 31st] The House of Commons today held a heated debate on the Palestine issue. Opposition leader Winston Churchill expressed regret over the base war and terrorism in Palestine, demanding that the British government immediately resolve the issue of the Holy Land, or, unless the United States is willing to share equally with Britain its bloodshed, disturbances, and all tasks, the mandate of Palestine should be transferred to a United Nations organization. Britain has broken its past assurances and, having failed to implement its policies, has no right to remain in Palestine. While the British House of Commons was debating, a formal proclamation was issued in Jerusalem, ordering the complete evacuation of British women and children from Palestine. According to government officials, the order to evacuate women and children should not be taken as a comprehensive war against terrorism; this measure is largely a precautionary one. Colonial Secretary Jones stated that the government is indeed seeking a final solution.</p>
<p>Conservative Party member and former Colonial Secretary Stanley stated that if peace cannot be maintained, the Holy Land will become a land of bloodshed. Churchill accused the Labour government of being too weak in dealing with terrorism, stressing that in times of conflict, there cannot be a lack of fighting spirit, and praised the recent revocation of the sentences imposed on terrorists as a path to defeat and shame. Churchill acknowledged that if Britain were to withdraw, civil war would easily break out in Palestine, but the British army's presence in Palestine in the current situation cannot be justified by this matter and the strategic position of Palestine. Britain should remain in the Suez Canal area and no longer pay attention to the strategic position of Palestine, and he has never thought that Britain has a strategic relationship with Palestine.</p>
<h3>Indian Muslim League Rejects British Plan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Karachi, 31st] The Executive Committee of the All-India Muslim League today passed a resolution exceeding 3,000 words, declaring that it still adheres to its previous resolution to reject the British Inter-India Plan, and at the same time demanded the dissolution of India's Constitutional Assembly.</p>

<h3>Burmese Dissatisfied with British-Burmese Agreement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rangoon, 31st] Neutral observers here believe that Aung San, chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, will encounter the most severe political test after returning to Burma from Britain on Sunday, because most Burmese people oppose the British-Burmese Agreement. Therefore, the success or failure of the Burmese Constituent Assembly depends on Aung San's response to the people's actions. Most people feel that the British-Burmese Agreement was signed under unfair conditions, and only a small number of people lacking extreme ideas believe that independence can be obtained as a result.</p>
<h3>McKell Appointed Governor-General of Australia</h3>
<p>Originally a Boilermaker</p>
<p>[United Press International, London, 31st] The British King today approved the appointment of New South Wales Premier McKell as Governor-General of Australia, succeeding the Duke of Gloucester. The Duke has been transferred to one of the three Secretaries of State, acting on behalf of the King during the King's tour. Some parties opposed this appointment because McKell was a Labour activist, but their opposition was ineffective. McKell was born in New South Wales in 1891, and at the age of thirteen, he dropped out of school to become a boilermaker.</p>

<h3>Treaty of Peace with Germany and Austria Should Be Negotiated by the Five Great Powers: Accurate Views from Our Foreign Affairs Personnel</h3>

It is said that China does not attach importance to the invitation from the four Deputy Foreign Ministers for China to present its views, but China advocates that the negotiations for the German and Austrian peace treaties should be discussed and agreed upon by the five great powers.

<p>Preparatory Steps Before Signing the Peace Treaty</p>

<h3>General Strike in Japan Canceled: Overthrow of the Cabinet Continues: MacArthur's Ban Takes Effect</h3>
<p>[Kaizo Publishing, Tokyo, 1st] The general strike scheduled to be launched by 8.6 million Japanese people today was aborted due to MacArthur's intervention. Japan was calm today, but this is the calm before another storm. Trade unions across the country have temporarily adopted a strategy of decentralization to continue the struggle. The National Public Servants Joint Struggle Committee, the highest command organization for the "2.1" strike, composed of 12 trade unions, including the National Railway Workers' Union, the Urban Federation, teachers of large, medium, and small schools, postal and telecommunications workers, and administrative staff, and the National Trade Union Joint Struggle Committee, composed of trade unions from the Labor General League and industry-specific unions, announced their dissolution last night. However, although the Public Servants Joint Struggle Committee has been dissolved, the trade unions of each unit will not stop the struggle and are planning to strengthen unity and decide to establish a liaison council after the dissolution of the Joint Struggle Committee. The National Railway Workers' Union issued a statement today stating: "We, the people of the occupied country, cannot but obey MacArthur's order, but we must overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet."</p>
<p>Japanese Trade Union Submits Appeal</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 1st] After MacArthur ordered a ban on the general strike, the Japanese Central Strike Committee appealed to the Allied Control Commission for Japan and requested the Far East Committee in Washington to send personnel to investigate the matter. The Strike Committee wrote to MacArthur, requesting him to fully understand the situation of Japanese workers and urge the reactionary Yoshida government to meet the workers' demands. The letter to the Allied Control Commission expressed regret over MacArthur's ban, saying that this strike was all about implementing Japan's democratization and safeguarding the workers' important rights, and hoped that the Control Commission could arbitrate the matter.</p>
<h3>General Strike Fails: Individual Strikes Will Be Launched</h3>
<p>No Resentment Expressed by the Labor Community</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] Last night, Tokyo Radio reported to 8.6 million workers in a sad tone that MacArthur had banned the general strike, and canceled this largest-scale general strike at the last moment. The person who broadcast this news was Ino Toshiro, chairman of the Joint Struggle Committee. After telling the workers not to strike anymore, he couldn't stop crying. His broadcast was very short, but he said he didn't understand why MacArthur wanted to ban this general strike. Everything here this morning was as usual, and government officials went to work on time. The Japanese labor community did not express any resentment towards MacArthur's order to cancel the strike, but labor community members believe that MacArthur's order only prohibits general strikes and does not prohibit individual strikes. Various public utility trade unions have been preparing to launch individual strikes. The Japanese Transport Workers' Union announced this morning that its 130,000 freight workers will launch an individual strike this afternoon, and other trade unions are expected to follow suit.</p>
<h3>Yoshida Cabinet: Difficult Future</h3>
<p>[Kaizo Publishing, Tokyo, 1st] Both the Liberal and Progressive government parties expressed dissatisfaction after the reorganization of the Yoshida Cabinet. The Liberal Party is dissatisfied with the inclusion of Hokkaido Governor Masuda in the cabinet, believing that these "bureaucrats" or "quasi-bureaucrats" should not be used. Masuda was appreciated by the authorities for resolving the Hokkaido coal mine strike. The Liberal Party is also concerned about Yoshida's future use of Ho Tai as Minister of Agriculture and Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board. The Progressive Party expressed even greater dissatisfaction with this reorganization. The party's members of parliament decided yesterday to question Yoshida on whether he intended to form a coalition cabinet for the third time, and also believed that the selection of candidates for this reorganization did not conform to the spirit of constitutionalism. This reorganization did not have any symbolism sufficient to indicate that the Liberal and Progressive parties were closely cooperating to overcome difficulties. The party expressed the most anger at Yoshida's awarding of several cabinet seats to the Liberal Party and not selecting Progressive Party members to enter the cabinet, openly expressing Yoshida's contempt for the Progressive Party. Therefore, observers believe that the Yoshida Cabinet will become more difficult in the future. Although Yoshida's vacancy of several cabinet seats can be explained as waiting for the Socialist Party to enter the cabinet, it is not a slight to the Progressive Party. However, in view of the failure of the two attempts to bring in the Socialist Party, another attempt to decide on joint work is also likely to fail. The Japanese political situation may enter the biggest turmoil since the war.</p>
<h3>Soviet Representative of the Allied Control Commission for Japan Demands Fishing Rights in Japanese Territorial Waters</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 1st] Lieutenant General Trevyaneko, the Soviet representative to the Allied Control Commission for Japan, today demanded fishing rights in Japanese territorial waters and planned to include the matter on the agenda of the four-power meeting on February 5.

At the same time, the Fund may subsidize cash to purchase clothing, shoes, and medicine, and assist orphanages and other institutions.</p>
<h3>Soviet Focus Shifts to Domestic Affairs</h3>
<p>—Translated by Our Newspaper's Research Department</p>
<p>We only need to look at the enormous impact of the past ten years' several Five-Year Plans on the Soviet Union's industry, economy, and the people's lives to understand why the Soviet Union is now turning its attention back to domestic affairs. Since the establishment of the Soviet state, a quarter of its time has been spent in two major wars, and what is now needed is stability and development. Every Soviet citizen living west of the Volga River can personally witness the desolation left behind by the Germans, and everything needs to be rebuilt. To the east is the new Ural industrial zone, which has been painstakingly developed since 1941. Many industrial experts believe that this area will become the place where the Soviet Union's future life is entrusted.</p>
<p>Two goals have always been in the hearts of the Soviet people. First, is the hope for increased production of daily consumer goods. This depends entirely on the success of the Five-Year Plan. Second, is the hope for national security. In his speech last February, Stalin assured the people that the success of successive Five-Year Plans would enable the Soviet Union's national strength to reach such a level that it would no longer need to fear any external threats.</p>
<p>Therefore, the new Five-Year Plan simultaneously answers two questions: When will there be more goods? And when will there be true security?</p>
<p>Because of this aspiration, the Soviet people are willing to endure all sacrifices and hardships today for a better future. In the Soviet Union, a common saying is: After the completion of the Five-Year Plan, we will be able to do this and that. On the large farms of Ukraine, farmers are talking about the day when they will have more cattle and sheep, more tools, and better houses. Of course, everything is difficult at the moment. However, when the Soviet people accepted the decree extending the food rationing period, they were thinking that once this Five-Year Plan is successful, all these shortcomings will disappear.</p>
<p>Last October, during the celebration of the 29th anniversary of the Great Revolution in Red Square, the many flags waving in the wind showed this fervor for domestic production. The flags were embroidered with the highest records of ship, shoe, and book production. The headlines in the newspapers are also frequently about the huge numbers of factory production.</p>
<p>Every Soviet citizen knows that they will benefit from this expansion of industrial production in the future. At present, the Soviet people can get very little, but they understand that the harder they work and the harder their companions work, the more likely they will have a better life in the future.</p>
<p>There is also a great driving force behind this effort, and that is the patriotism that was born during the war. During this difficult war, the Soviet people saw their country becoming stronger and stronger. Therefore, psychologically, they have established an inseparable connection between their own destiny and history and that of their country.</p>
<p>The average Soviet citizen hears Stalin say that the only way to obtain "security" is through the large-scale expansion of industrial production. Therefore, the Soviet people are focusing on domestic affairs, not only because they can get more consumer goods, but also because they can get their own security. For half a century, the Russian people have suffered more foreign aggression than any Western country, and the painful experience of this war against Germany has taught them a lesson: seeking "security" has become their most pressing hope.</p>
<p>The goal is still external, but in order to achieve this goal, the Soviet government and people realize that the most important thing now is to strengthen national power, mainly to catch up with Britain and the United States in industrial production. Because of this, the entire Soviet Union is currently focused on domestic industrial production, and is temporarily unwilling to be too prominent in diplomatic negotiations.</p>

<h3>Black Market Price of White Rice Soars; Mayor Expresses No Worry; Two Million Bags of Tribute Rice Can Last Until August; Unlimited Supply at Wholesale Price Unchanged; But Most Shanghai Residents Do Not Pay Attention to Nutrition</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] In response to the recent soaring black market price of white rice, Mayor Wu specifically summoned reporters at 5:00 PM yesterday to issue a statement, saying: Although the black market price of white rice has risen to 90,000, the price of medium-quality rice (Saigon rice and domestic indica rice) has not changed. The government continues to sell Saigon rice, maintaining the original wholesale price of 63,000 per shi (unit of dry measure), and a retail price of 70,000, and the supply is unlimited. The food situation this year is not as serious as last year because the government has provided local governments with a large amount of rice. The city currently has two million bags of medium-quality rice. Based on the city's current monthly consumption of 300,000 dan (unit of dry measure), even if the source of supply is cut off in the future, it is sufficient to maintain the city's food supply until August. Therefore, citizens do not need to panic. Furthermore, white rice is only one type of rice. It is produced in the Suzhou-Wuxi area. According to rice merchants, the current price increase is due to the price in the production area having risen to over 70,000 per shi. The medium-quality rice currently distributed by the government is more nutritious than white rice, but wealthy people in Shanghai generally prefer to eat white rice, which is less nutritious but more expensive. In the past, the government had no rice, but now there is a sufficient supply of rice, but it is all medium-quality rice. Therefore, if you want the price of white rice to fall, on the one hand, we hope that citizens will eat less white rice and use medium-quality rice as a substitute. By doing so, we will not create a black market price for white rice, and it is believed that the price of white rice can fall within two weeks. Mayor Wu continued to say that the distribution of flour will definitely not be interrupted and that the ration will remain the same.</p>
<p>Rice Dealers Pay Homage to the Mayor, Requesting Rationing of Real White Rice Collected as Tax</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Rice Dealers' Association, considering that Saigon rice is less popular and that citizens usually prefer to eat white rice, decided at a meeting a few days ago to petition the authorities that in addition to selling Saigon rice, they also hope to be able to ration a portion of the white rice collected as tax in kind, in order to suppress market prices. Yesterday morning, they sent Qu Zhenhua, Zhang Xichao, Yang Runyu, and Su Boxun as representatives to pay homage to Mayor Wu to convey this intention. Mayor Wu was out on official business, so the four representatives paid homage again at 2:30 PM in the afternoon, at which time Ji Mingqi, the chief of the Food Section of the Bureau of Social Affairs, was also present. Mayor Wu then stated: If other prices all rise while the authorities only suppress the price of rice, then rice merchants and farmers will suffer losses. However, based on the ratio of the past year, the recent increase in rice prices is clearly excessive. The city government will increase investigations and prohibitions. At the same time, it is hoped that all rice dealers will not buy black market white rice that exceeds the limit price, and customers are advised to purchase and eat Saigon rice. Then the trend of rising white rice prices can be suppressed.</p>
<p>Insufficient Inventory Creates Black Market</p>
<p>According to rice merchants, the recent rise in the black market price of white rice is due to insufficient inventory and a scarce source of supply. Due to the influence of high-interest loans, before the end of the lunar year, Shanghai merchants only had about 50,000 zuo (unit of dry measure) of white rice in stock, and farmers usually do not officially start shipping out until after the fifteenth day of the first lunar month. Therefore, the current retail price of white rice after careful deliberation is 76,000 per shi, while the black market price has risen to 90,000.</p>
<h3>Price Fluctuations; Chairman Concerned</h3>
<p>According to Commander Xuan Tiewu yesterday, when he was summoned to Nanjing to pay homage to Chairman Chiang, the Chairman was most concerned about the price fluctuations in Shanghai during the Lunar New Year. He said that if various prices rise without restriction, it will have a great impact on people's livelihoods, and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent this. At the same time, the Chairman also expressed concern about the treatment of police in Shanghai. The work of the police in Shanghai is particularly heavy compared to other places. They should be given security in their lives so that they can work with peace of mind.</p>
<h3>President Song Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday by Plane</h3>
<p>President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, took a special plane from Nanjing at 9:00 AM yesterday with secretaries and staff, arriving safely at Longhua Airport at 10:10 AM. After a brief rest at his private residence, President Song went to the Bank of China Building at around 11:00 AM to handle official business, returning to his residence after an hour.

<h3>The Teacher Management District Has No Place to Work; Work Can Only Begin After Waiting</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Since the establishment of the Shanghai Teacher Management District Command, work has not been able to proceed smoothly due to the lack of a command post. It is currently temporarily borrowing the Haizhi Naval Brigade headquarters on Kunming Road. Most of the important staff have come to Shanghai from Chongqing, and they are living and eating in the office, which is quite inconvenient. The department is currently preparing to print an announcement to the citizens of Shanghai and important military service laws, which will be widely posted in the near future to promote publicity. The department's news bureau will be established after moving to a new location. As for the start date for investigating eligible young men, physical examinations, and drawing lots for enlistment, it will be decided after the Municipal Council approves the Municipal Government's budget for the establishment of a military affairs section. The number of recruits in the first phase will be announced after the order from the Ministry of National Defense arrives.</p>

<h3>Blacklisted Movie Star, Yan Yuexian, Granted Amnesty</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Following Yuan Meiyun and Xia Peizhen, movie star Yan Yuexian, who was detained for smoking opium, has been detained since December 25th of last year, and has already quit her opium addiction in prison. The First Criminal Court of the District Court questioned her yesterday afternoon. Yan was wearing a black cotton qipao and a brown long-haired velvet coat, and her face showed no signs of opium addiction. She was very calm when answering questions in court. Judge Shen Tianbao routinely asked her name, age, and place of origin. Yan confessed that she had smoked opium, but said that she had quit after entering prison. Judge Shen then announced that the case occurred in 1946, which meets the requirements for amnesty under Item A of the amnesty order. She was ordered to find a guarantor through her defense lawyer and was released in court.</p>

<h3>Ships Depart Early; Passengers Make Futile Trips</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] When a ship carries passengers, the Maritime Administration Bureau stipulates the size of the ship, the number of passenger seats, and the condition of the equipment. If there is excessive loading, it will be subject to considerable punishment once it is found out. However, at the end of the Lunar New Year, many people working in Shanghai returned to their hometowns to spend the New Year, resulting in trains, highway buses, and ships being more crowded than usual, and it was impossible to restrict this. As a result, the Zhijiang ship, which runs on the port route, was overloaded and collided with the Huatong tugboat at Wusongkou, resulting in a tragic accident. After this case occurred, the Maritime Administration Bureau paid special attention, and dispatched personnel to the dock to monitor the departure of the ships sailing to Tongyang, Chongming, and Qidong. It is now known that the number of passengers going to Beisha has gradually increased again. Therefore, the Jiangkang ship, operated by Datong United Company on the Shanghai-Tong line, departed early on both of the past two days because there were too many passengers. Therefore, when the number of passengers boarding the ship was close to the limit set by the Maritime Administration Bureau, it set sail immediately. The ships were originally scheduled to depart at 10:00 PM every night, but on the past two nights, they departed at around 8:00 PM, causing some passengers who had already purchased tickets to not only miss the ship, but also waste money on transportation back and forth. They also suffered other unexpected losses. Therefore, the passengers all advocate that the ship should still depart on time. If you want to avoid excessive passengers, it is better to limit the sale of tickets.</p>
<h3>Water Supply Difficulties in Western Shanghai; Emergency Measures to Dig Artesian Wells; Needs 9.4 Billion, Awaiting Approval by the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Water supply is difficult in Western Shanghai, and local residents feel inconvenienced. In the blink of an eye, summer is coming, and water is needed. If it is not improved, there will be many difficulties. The Bureau of Public Utilities is currently trying to find a solution.</p>
<p>According to the discussion, the Yangshupu British Waterworks Company only supplies the former Public Concession area. West of Jing'an Temple, the roads were built across the border, and the master control belonged to our municipal government. However, the British Waterworks Company laid water pipes in the area long ago, creating a fait accompli. However, because the water pipes were narrow, the water supply was not smooth. After the victory, the Bureau of Public Utilities was eager to solve this serious problem. The contract between the British Waterworks Company and our government is about to expire, and the Bureau of Public Utilities' research on the company's supply volume has also reached a saturation point and cannot be increased. Moreover, from Yangshupu to Western Shanghai, laying water pipes has a diameter of up to nine kilometers, which is too far.</p>
<p>Construction of the Longhua Water Plant Cannot Be Realized at Present</p>
<p>After research, it is planned to build a water plant in the Southern Huangpu area to supply the needs of Western Shanghai. However, its location cannot be too south, as the water pipes would be too long. After surveying and discussing, it is believed that the current Longhua Airport area is the most suitable. However, because the water plant is located next to the airport, it poses many obstacles to the take-off and landing of airplanes, so it is still a problem. In addition, funds and materials are also two major difficulties. Under the current high-interest loan situation, the profits of public utilities are meager, and it is not easy to encourage people to invest enthusiastically. In addition to the material problem, the United States is currently facing a situation where countries around the world are placing orders after the war, and supply cannot meet demand. Therefore, this plan cannot be realized in three to five years.</p>
<p>Short-Term Difficulties in Solving Water Transportation in Nanshi</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the Nanshi Inland Waterworks has a surplus of water supply because some factories in Nanshi were destroyed during the war and have not been restored, and there are fewer users. At the intersection of Jilu and Xietu Road, there is a water pipe that can lead to Western Shanghai to transport water. It is four kilometers long. However, this 20-inch diameter water pipe cannot be found in Shanghai at present, and even if the water pipes can be connected, Western Shanghai will need to build reservoirs, pumps, and other equipment. Therefore, this method cannot be easily solved in the short term. The current emergency measures are only to rush to dig artesian wells. Although there are many difficulties in geology and water volume, it is still a stopgap measure. The Bureau of Public Utilities prepared a detailed plan in December of last year. The total cost, including water supply from Nanshi and digging artesian wells in Western Shanghai, totals 9.4 billion. It was sent to the Municipal Council to be added to this year's budget. The Public Utilities Committee decided in principle to pass it during the review. However, because the Municipal Council's discussion of the Municipal Government's entire budget has not yet reached a conclusion, it is still unknown whether this plan can be fully approved. The Bureau of Public Utilities has already started preparations, and once the Municipal Council approves the plan in March and the Municipal Government allocates the funds, it can be coordinated and rushed. In this way, the water supply problem in Western Shanghai may be improved before this summer.</p>
<h3>All Passenger Planes Thoroughly Inspected; Both Companies' Freight Transportation As Usual</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] After the Ministry of Communications ordered the temporary suspension of passenger transportation by China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation, in order to prevent further unfortunate incidents from occurring, it ordered both companies to thoroughly inspect all passenger planes, with a deadline of one week. Both companies have already started inspections, which are expected to take two weeks to complete. At the same time, the airport equipment and meteorological reports will be improved separately. It is heard that the resumption of flights will be no earlier than mid-February.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] After the Ministry of Communications expressly ordered the temporary suspension of air passenger transportation, both companies' freight transportation is still flying as usual, but the schedule is irregular.</p>

<h3>New Telephone Directory Printed; Uses Up to 200 Tons of Paper; 120,000 Copies to Be Distributed Starting Next Week</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to the Shanghai Telephone Company, the long-awaited 1947 Chinese and English edition telephone directory will be printed in the coming days and will be distributed to users starting next week. This is the first new telephone directory to be issued since 1941. Compiling this new telephone directory took more than two months and mobilized approximately 200 people.</p>
<p>The 1947 telephone directory is the largest in terms of length since the Shanghai Telephone Company began issuing telephone directories. The Chinese version has a total of 850 pages per copy, and the English version has a total of 550 pages per copy, an increase of 280 pages compared to the pre-war edition, that is, an increase of 24 percent.</p>
<p>A total of 121,000 copies of the new Chinese and English telephone directories have been printed, including 100,000 copies of the Chinese version and 21,000 copies of the English version, an increase of 17,000 copies compared to the 1941 edition.</p>
<p>These 121,000 copies of the new telephone directory total 96 million pages. If each page is connected end to end and laid flat, the total length would be 15,500 miles, which is equal to three-fifths of the circumference of the earth around the equator.</p>
<p>The 1947 telephone directory used a total of more than 200 tons of paper. At a time when paper is scarce around the world, it is no easy task to complete this work.</p>
<p>A total of 13 tons of metal were used for the printing plates. The font used for the English version is called "Bell Gothic," which was designed and made by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company specifically for printing telephone directories. The font used for the Chinese version was also specially made by the Shanghai Telephone Company itself.</p>
<p>The new telephone directory combines and publishes the users of the Shanghai Telephone Company and the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, listing up to 200,000 account names. In addition to making it quick and easy for users to check, the compilation method also focuses on various conveniences. The most notable is the parallel publication of new and old place names, so that the difficulties caused by road names can be resolved.</p>
<p>In addition to individually publishing ordinary business and residential users, it is also classified and arranged according to the nature of the business, organization, group, and occupation, totaling 1,000 types. There are also 3,000 advertisements. Therefore, the telephone directory can also be used as a directory for all sectors in the city.</p>
<h3>Insured Parcels Within the Country Can Now Be Resumed for Acceptance and Mailing</h3>

<h3>Wang Zijian Passed Away and Will Be Cremated According to His Instructions</h3>
<p>Wang Zijian, a famous Chinese legal scholar, practiced law after leaving politics. During the War of Resistance, he stopped his business and stayed at home. He then suffered a stroke. After several years of bed rest, he passed away on January 31st. His will states that no obituaries should be issued, no condolences should be accepted, and he should be cremated immediately. His family has decided to follow his will and keep everything simple. The coffin will be placed in the China Funeral Home at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th of this month, and he will be cremated on the same day. Wang was known for his integrity and was impoverished after his death. Close relatives and friends believe that wreaths and tin foil are a waste of money, and they plan to give condolences instead to help with the funeral expenses, which is more practical.</p>
<h3>A Piece of Copper, a Handful of Ashes: Don't Relax if You Want the Truth - Excavating the Fire Site: City Government Sends Laborers, Wang Family Sends Supervisors. Gu Xun and Zhu Changhe Regain Freedom Yesterday.</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] After the fire on Seymour Road, discussions arose from all quarters, especially regarding the allegations of firefighters looting during the fire, which spread far and wide. Although the five-person investigation committee has been working hard for days and has made some progress, five firefighters suspected of dereliction of duty have also been detained. However, the gold bars, jewelry, and other items lost from Wang Yunfu's home remain missing as of this moment. The investigation committee suggested to the Wang family that they carefully excavate the remaining ashes of the fire site, as the truth might be revealed from the debris. However, the Wang family objected, as they had already been excavating continuously for three days and three nights after the fire without any results. However, in order to thoroughly clarify the truth of the case, the investigation committee has, as of yesterday, sent laborers from the city government to excavate the fire site, and the Wang family has sent people to supervise the site. Zhang Da, the chief of the police bureau's inspection department, stated yesterday, "As long as we don't let go of every handful of ash, every piece of broken copper and scrap iron, the truth will surely be revealed one day!"</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to further seek the truth of the matter, the investigation committee paid separate visits to the U.S. Military Police in Xinzha Road and Song Zhipeng of the Chinese Military Police in Penglai Road yesterday afternoon. This was because the investigation committee had previously received information that Song Zhipeng had witnessed firefighters looting while passing through Wuding Road on the night of the fire. It is said that when the fire was raging, Mr. Song saw a firefighter leisurely watching the fire and immediately pushed him, saying, "Brother, why aren't you putting out the fire?" The stolen goods hidden near the firefighter immediately fell to the ground. In order to verify this information, the investigation committee visited yesterday afternoon, but unfortunately, Mr. Song was out on business and could not be met. The investigation committee also went to the U.S. Military Police yesterday to interview Captain Jack Goldmau, Lieutenant Bailev, and officer on duty C. Tzuet, who were present at the scene that day.</p>
<p>In addition, district chief Li Xun and firefighter Zhu Changhe, number 017, who were detained for suspected dereliction of duty in the fire case, have been proven to have been mistakenly detained. After requesting instructions from the mayor, they were released on bail yesterday afternoon. Currently, those still in detention include squadron leader Huang Baoqi, squad leader Shang Zhikui, number 340, and firefighters Dai Guangrong, number 011, Yuan Chengjun, number 108, and Cai Qiaoying, number 587. They are currently still detained in the police局 detention center and have not been transferred to the district prosecutor's office.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Police Bureau Inspection Department Chief Zhang Da, who spoke to reporters yesterday, the investigation committee will be dismissed after collecting sufficient information. As for the criminal part, it is planned to be handled by the police bureau's criminal division. The details of the investigation committee's visit to the U.S. Military Police yesterday are as follows:</p>
<h3>Asked Why They Didn't Put Out the Fire, Answered That Many Team Members Were New Recruits.</h3>
<p>Mr. Goldmau has many years of service in the former Municipal Council Fire Brigade and has extensive fire-fighting experience. After the fire on Seymour Road occurred, he personally went to the fire scene to assist in the firefighting and was injured as a result. Rubber plasters were still applied to his face and neck yesterday. He answered the various questions asked by the investigation committee in great detail, but he firmly refused to express an opinion on whether the firefighters had been derelict in their duties. He only stated that it was indeed a fact that the firefighters were not working hard to put out the fire. At that time, he met an old friend, number 101 (the old number from the past), from the former Municipal Council Fire Brigade and asked, "Why aren't they putting out the fire?" The reply was, "They are all new recruits."</p>
<p>According to Mr. Goldmau, he arrived at the fire scene at midnight, at which time number eleven was already on fire and spreading. He climbed onto the roof and tried to chop off the lead sheeting. Because the lead sheeting was very thick, the chopping took time. Although he managed to remove it, it was too late, and the fire had already spread to house number five. At that time, he also went to inspect the houses in each residence and saw leather hoses lying scattered on the ground, but very little water was being discharged. A total of three fire trucks from the U.S. military came to assist in the firefighting, one each from the Army, Navy, and Port Fire Association. Because the fire hydrants near the fire scene were either damaged or already being used by the Chinese firefighters, the hydrants for connecting the water hoses were very far from the fire scene, and the length of the hoses laid out reached 1,000 feet.</p>
<h3>Leather Hoses Burst, Hydrants Broken: Firefighting Equipment Needs to be Improved.</h3>
<p>Mr. Goldmau stated that the fire was indeed unprecedented and was the first time in his decades of firefighting experience. He believed that the reason for the fire spreading was the wooden shed on the east side of number twenty-nine. If the firefighters had been familiar with the local situation and had demolished the wooden shed first, this disaster could have been avoided.</p>
<p>Senator Zhang asked if he had witnessed any firefighters looting during the fire. Mr. Goldmau replied: No, I am an old firefighter. If I had seen it, I would have given them a beating. Mr. Goldmau finally stated that to ensure that Shanghai would not have another major fire in the future, firefighting equipment must be improved. Burst hoses and broken hydrants will inevitably delay important matters.</p>
<h3>French Girl Falls into Prostitution: Not Favored by Her Adoptive Mother, Life Becomes Debauched.</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Regarding the case of a fourteen-year-old French girl who went missing in this city some days ago and was found in a brothel, the details of the matter are as follows:</p>
<p>The girl, Micheline Jarmot, originally named Luban, was the daughter of Russian woman Khlopiskaya. Because she was unable to support her, she was sent to Mrs. Kamilov's orphanage. There, a French couple, Mr. and Mrs. Jarmot, who were old and childless, came to the orphanage to adopt a girl. Seeing that Luban was fair-skinned and lovely, they took her home and adopted her as their daughter, naming her Micheline. This happened twelve years ago. As time passed, Micheline gradually grew up. Mr. Jarmot loved her as his own daughter and enrolled her in the French school in this city. Mr. Jarmot owned several properties near the Renaissance Garden on Lafayette Road and specifically named them Micheline Apartments, showing the depth of his love for his daughter. Mrs. Jarmot did not particularly like the girl, but because her husband doted on her, they lived in relative peace. Three years ago, Mr. Jarmot passed away due to illness, and Micheline's unfortunate life began from then on. Not only was she not favored by her adoptive mother, but she was also often scolded and beaten, and she had no joy at home. Therefore, she began to develop outward. She started to socialize with American soldiers. Although the girl was only fourteen years old, she was tall and well-developed and looked like an adult. From then on, her life gradually became debauched, and Mrs. Jarmot's dislike for her grew stronger. Three months ago, the girl suddenly went missing. Mrs. Jarmot pretended not to care and did not look for her. A neighbor, Russian man Noviski, was a good friend of Mr. Jarmot during his lifetime and had a lot of sympathy for the girl. Seeing that the girl had not returned for a long time, he became suspicious and discussed it with a friend. The editor of the Russian newspaper here published the news of Micheline's disappearance and appealed to the Municipal Council to investigate. She was finally discovered recently in a brothel on Park Road. It is said that after Micheline left home, she went with an American soldier friend to another brothel in Hongkou. The owner of that brothel did not dare to take her in. Later, she was introduced by a servant and sold to a brothel on Park Road. When Micheline was discovered, her Russian friends, including Gillykin, took her back. She begged them, "Please don't take me to my adoptive mother's house!" Her adoptive mother, Mrs. Jarmot, has now hired lawyer Plem to file a complaint with the district court, demanding to sever their mother-daughter relationship. Micheline is represented by lawyer Shifushenko, hired by her father figure Noviski. The district court has already held one hearing. The plaintiff claimed that Micheline's behavior was improper and that, according to French law, she should be taken back by Mrs. Kamilov, the owner of the former orphanage. The defendant's lawyer argued that when Mr. Jarmot adopted her, both parties signed a document, so Micheline is actually a legal daughter and cannot be severed from the relationship because of her improper behavior. The district court has now ordered both parties to provide French legal provisions and adoption evidence before rescheduling the hearing.</p>

<h3>Dispute Over Insurance Amount for Pig Bristles: Investigation Shows Only Over a Hundred Crates Destroyed.</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Wang Yunfu family, who suffered the heaviest losses in the Seymour Road fire, had 400 crates of pig bristles belonging to Wang Shanqing, the eldest son of the Wang family. The China, McCall, and other banks that held the mortgage had insured them for 695 million yuan, with China, Anping, Taifeng, and China Industrial Insurance Company as reinsurers. Among them, the insurance amount of the China Insurance Company was the largest, at 413 million yuan. Various insurance companies commissioned Guohua Notary Office to go to the Wang residence for valuation and investigation. It is said that only over one hundred crates of pig bristles were destroyed, with a market value of over 100 million yuan. The person in charge of the China Insurance Company stated that, according to insurance regulations, if the insurance amount exceeds the actual value of the goods, compensation can only be made based on the actual value of the destroyed goods. Therefore, there is still a dispute between the two parties. It is understood that Guohua Notary Office, various insurance companies, and related parties are scheduled to go to the Wang residence again tomorrow to investigate and determine exactly how many crates of pig bristles were destroyed.</p>
<h3>U.S. Soldier Saw Firefighter Leaning Against Wall, Standing by Doing Nothing.</h3>
<p>Lieutenant Bailey and Officer-of-the-Day Tzuet said that what they witnessed was similar to what Mr. Goldmau said. Mr. Bailey also admitted that he used his sidearm to break the glass of the third-floor window of number twenty-nine so that the water could come into contact with the fire. When asked whether the firefighters were working hard to put out the fire, he initially refused to answer. After Zhang Nai Zuo and others repeatedly encouraged him, he replied that he had seen twelve firefighters leaning against the wall and standing by doing nothing.</p>
<h3>Look at Others, Think of Yourself.</h3>
<p>After reporting the details of the rescue operation that day, they also gave a demonstration of firefighting on the spot. Their pumps, hoses, and other equipment were in good condition, and their movements were skilled. Even during practice, the spirit of the firefighters was extremely tense. From the time the vehicle departed to the time the water was discharged, it only took five minutes.</p>
<h3>Investigation Committee Sets Up Suggestion Box.</h3>
<p>The investigation committee has set up a suggestion box in the fire scene since yesterday. The public is encouraged to express their opinions on the exposure of criminal behavior and the improvement of firefighting facilities to provide the authorities with powerful assistance. There is no need to sign the suggestions submitted, nor is there any legal responsibility to be borne.</p>
<p>Xuan Tiewu's Remarks on the Fire Case.</p>
<p>Regarding the investigation of the fire case, the reporter asked Director Xuan yesterday. According to Mr. Xuan, the criminal division's investigation report on the case has been submitted to the investigation committee for reference, and he does not want to comment on it. The truth of the case will be determined by the investigation of the investigation committee. However, regarding this case, when I met Speaker Pan Gongzhan of the Senate at Commander Zhengmo's banquet around the 25th of last month and talked about this matter, I immediately instructed Director Zhou of the Fire Department to be responsible for a thorough investigation and ordered him to work with the district chief and baojia leaders of the district to conduct sincere interviews with the victims and nearby residents to clarify the truth. At the same time, he instructed Director Zhang of the Criminal Division to investigate and report, and ordered him to pay special attention to the mistakes of the firefighters in terms of technology and discipline. The current situation of the case will depend on the results of the investigation committee. The police局 is a party involved, so I do not want to express any opinions. The reporter then asked if someone had strongly advocated that the firefighting business be changed to private operation. Mr. Xuan replied: I am also very much in favor of private firefighting. This move can not only reduce the government's responsibility, but also strengthen the people's ability to govern themselves. However, firefighting in various countries is mostly handled by the government. In the former Shanghai concession era, there was also the establishment of a fire department. The importance of the fire department being independent from the police department in various countries can be imagined. Because the fire department is not only responsible for firefighting after a fire, but also pays special attention to fire prevention facilities in peacetime. Currently, due to limited funding, the current fire department is attached to the police局.</p>

Wang Changgen claimed that he was old and weak and did not dare to commit illegal acts, but when he questioned the two women, they both said that Wang had indeed raped them. The two victims were sent to Nanyang Hospital, and after an examination, it was found that the hymens of both women had indeed been broken long ago. Wang finally had nothing to say and admitted the charges. He was then taken into custody to await being sent to the prosecutor's office for punishment according to law.</p>

<h3>Japanese Medical Officer at Shenyang Concentration Camp Sentenced to Hanging Again - Tortured Prisoners and Embezzled Medicines During His Tenure - 140 People Died from Abuse.</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Captain Kuwashima, a former medical officer at the Prisoner of War Concentration Camp in Pan Yang, was sentenced to death by hanging by the U.S. Military Tribunal here for abusing British and American prisoners during his tenure.

<h3>High Court Notice: Case Handlers Should Be Clean and Honest - Secretly Report Those Who Flaunt Influence</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Guo Yunguan, President of the High Court, and Du Baoqi, Chief Prosecutor, jointly issued a notice yesterday to dispel doubts. The original text is as follows: "This court handles cases purely based on evidence and makes judgments according to law. All case handlers have been carefully selected and are clean, honest, and do not accept any requests for special favors. If someone is flaunting their influence outside, falsely claiming to be acquainted with court personnel and can be bribed for intercession, their sole intention is to swindle money. This not only infringes on the legal rights of the people, but also damages the reputation of the court, which is extremely hateful. We have repeatedly notified litigants and others not to be fooled by such swindlers. Please secretly report their names and addresses to the court, and we will definitely investigate and prosecute them to the full extent of the law. This court has repeatedly issued orders regarding the rectification of discipline, fearing that laxity may arise over time. We hereby reiterate the previous order."</p>
<h3>Shen Qichang's Name Issue - High Court Questioned Xia Qifeng</h3>

<h3>Budget Committee Resolves: Municipal Construction Surtax Not Included in Budget; Finance Committee Requested to Plan for Revenue Enhancement</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The municipal construction surtax for the fiscal year was resolved by the Finance Committee of the Municipal Council the day before yesterday to be abolished, and the speaker and deputy speaker were requested to forward the resolution to the Budget Committee for review. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, the Budget Committee held its fourth meeting, where Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing specifically raised the issue. After discussion, it was resolved that "since the Finance Committee has decided to discontinue the municipal construction surtax, it should naturally not be included in this year's budget. However, the deficit between revenue and expenditure in the original budget proposal is even greater. The Finance Committee is still requested to deliberate and propose to the assembly how to request subsidies from the central government or devise methods to increase revenue to make up for the shortfall."</p>
<p>The Budget Committee, to examine the expenditure budgets of various municipal bureaus and offices for this year, decided to first appoint commissioners to participate in relevant subcommittee meetings to listen to reports and exchange opinions. At the same time, Councilors He Yuanming, Xu Yongzuo, Wang Naixu, and Yan Yilin were assigned to inspect the municipal government on February 4th at 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Regarding the case of improving police treatment, raising police quality, and eradicating bad habits, which was submitted by the Secretariat of the Municipal Council to the Budget Committee for deliberation, the committee concluded: "Except for the plan to increase the training of new police, which has already been reported on by the Central Work Review Committee and resolved by this committee, the remaining items do not affect the budget and should be sent to the Police Affairs Committee for handling."</p>
<p>The Autonomy Committee submitted a case to the Budget Committee "proposing to increase the funding for the District People's Representative Assemblies and add one secretary and one staff member each." The committee resolved to recommend to the Autonomy Committee that if the funding for the District People's Representative Assemblies is increased and full-time personnel are hired, the increase in expenditure would be substantial. It suggested exploring whether the District Offices could allocate dedicated personnel to serve in the assemblies to facilitate work and meet needs.</p>
<p>In addition, the committee also resolved other cases: (1) The organizational structure and budget for the National Guard training institution, and the Bureau of Public Works' proposed addition of special project expenses for the 36th fiscal year, are to be incorporated into the overall budget review. (2) The municipal government's request to authorize the advance expenditure of military service funds for the 36th fiscal year from February 1st onwards was resolved to be submitted to the assembly for discussion. (3) The municipal government's request to expand school classes was agreed to, provided that it remains within 20% of the total budget amount, in accordance with the Education Committee's review opinion.</p>
<h3>Dockworkers Engage in Another Brawl; Police Fire Shots to Disperse Crowd</h3>

At around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, another conflict broke out. Fortunately, the police, along with military police, arrived to suppress the situation, and the incident was resolved without further escalation. However, yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, another dispute arose between the two groups over the unloading of the Shengjing vessel, which had sailed from Hong Kong to Shanghai.

<h3>Layoff Incidents Occur One After Another; Social Bureau Mediates Three Cases; Lehua Cigarette Factory Reaches Labor-Management Reconciliation</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] At the beginning of the year, Zhao Banfu, Director of the Labor Department of the Social Bureau, told reporters that if the socio-economic situation does not improve, there will be a serious layoff problem in the industrial and commercial sectors this year. These words have unfortunately come true. The first case submitted to the Social Bureau for mediation was the No. 2 Shipyard of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which has more than 200 workers and intends to lay off 85. This matter is currently under mediation.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Lehua Cigarette Factory laid off 14 workers due to sluggish business. After mediation by the Social Bureau, both parties have signed a settlement record. The terms of the settlement are to follow the regulations of the Labor-Management Dispute Arbitration Committee, allocating severance pay and providing 20 days of wages as subsidies from the factory. Wages will be paid for the period of work stoppage from January 21st to January 31st. All of the above will be calculated based on the January cost of living index.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Shunfeng Motor Company laid off 22 drivers. The workers originally demanded a severance payment of 1.5 million yuan per person, which was reduced to 420,000 yuan. However, the management still refuses to agree. The Social Bureau is continuing its mediation efforts.</p>
<p>According to the Chief of the Mediation Section of the Labor Department of the Social Bureau, layoff problems are not always due to sluggish business. In some cases, the management is willing to lay off workers and pay severance in order to hire new workers because of poor labor-management relations.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Last year, the Sino-American Hospital on Baker Road experienced a serious labor-management dispute due to more than 40 employees requesting double pay at the end of the year and adjustments to their salaries starting in January of this year. The matter was resolved after mediation by Wang Yijing and others, the Chairman of the Municipal Hospital Federation. On the 31st of last month, more than 40 employees suddenly received termination letters from the hospital and demanded three months of severance pay and three months of living allowance. Yesterday at noon, Director Zhang of the Garrison Headquarters convened a mediation meeting between both parties, but no agreement was reached. Mediation will continue today.</p>

<h3>Social Services Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Medical and Health</p>
<p>(1) Blurred Vision</p>
<p>Xu Dingyi asks: (1) My eldest daughter, age 17, is studying in the countryside. Since the beginning of last semester, she has noticed blurred vision in both eyes. After the start of this semester, the situation has worsened. From morning to night, it seems like something is covering her eyes. She used Vocolin eyedrops, but they were ineffective. She also feels slight pain at night. What disease is this, and what medicine can cure it? (2) My second daughter, age 10, has a slightly enlarged neck this year. Some say it is a goiter. What causes this disease, is it dangerous, and what medicine can cure it?</p>
<p>[Dr. Zhang Zhongming replies] (1) It is likely a severe case of trachoma and should be treated thoroughly. (2) There are two types of goiter: one is caused by excessive iodine secretion, and the other is caused by insufficient iodine secretion. Excess secretion requires surgery, while insufficient secretion requires more iodine-rich foods such as kelp and seaweed.</p>
<p>(2) Hookworms in the Abdomen</p>
<p>Wang Rongfu asks: I have always been very healthy, but since this year, my strength has gradually decreased, and I have become pale and thin. I lack energy at work. I was treated at the Civilian Hospital a month ago. According to the doctor's stool test, I have hookworm parasites in my abdomen that cannot be cleared in a short period of time.

<h3>Market Rumors: Central Bank Tightens Control Without Relenting; Gold Prices Forced Down; Black Market for US Dollars Also Drops</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Central Bank exerted strong pressure, leading to high prices initially but then a decline later. The market opened at 4.11 million to 4.13 million, but immediately came under pressure and fell. The low price receded to 4.05 million and remained there, with the situation fluctuating and uncertain. However, it failed to break through the 4.1 million mark. After 10 AM, the Central Bank allocated 1,340 bars at a price of 4.08 million and vigorously sold them in the market, pushing the price down to 3.98 million before stabilizing. Soon after, it rebounded, rising again to 4.06 million. Later, rumors spread of an adjustment to the official exchange rate for US dollars, possibly to 6,500. The US dollar market also fell, dropping to 4.03 million at noon. In the afternoon, due to Saturday, the market saw a slight rebound, but ultimately closed 40,000 lower than the previous close.

Ultimately, it closed 150 yuan lower than the previous close. Hong Kong dollars also slightly decreased. It closed 20 yuan lower than the previous close.

<h3>Weakness in Chinese Stock Market; Wash Trades Monopolize Yong Yarn</h3>

Nos. 85, 171, 183, 224, 198, 14, and 231, as well as the North Group, aggressively bought, gradually pushing the price up to 856 yuan. There were sales outside the market, and floating profits were also settled. There was a slight decline at noon. Ultimately, compared to the previous close, Mayar, Xinhuo, Jingfu, and Xinguang were slightly lower, while Yong Yarn and Huafeng were slightly higher. The range of gains and losses was less than 10%. Trading in cold stocks was even less, and the gains and losses were still minimal. Spot Yong Yarn slightly increased, Huafeng was unchanged, and Xinhuo and Xinguang slightly decreased. The prices of various stocks outside the market were still stable.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks remained stable yesterday. Foreign firms continued to be keen to purchase rubber plantations, but there was no major change in any stock. Ultimately, compared to the previous close, Yeguang and Zhenye each increased by half a percent, while the rest all increased but not by much.</p>
<h3>Calm in Government Bond Market</h3>

<h3>Textile Control Administration Acquires Cotton Yarn; 6,763 Pieces Already Received</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Textile Control Administration received another batch of cotton yarn delivery notices yesterday from nine yarn factories, including Yong'an, Shenxin, Defeng, Anda, Rongfeng, and Guangquan, totaling 2,178 pieces of cotton yarn. Adding this to the 3,719 pieces delivered on the 30th and the 866 pieces delivered on the 31st, the total number of delivery notices received is 6,763 pieces of cotton yarn. The administration has already notified the Cotton Textile Association of the Sixth District, instructing the factories to submit all delivery notices for acquisition before January 25th by next Thursday so that they can be verified and acquired. The sampling work by the administration has already identified five factories. While some sampling results were above 90 points, there were also scores of zero. According to sampling regulations, those below 60 points will have their negotiated price reduced by 10%. It is understood that sampling will be conducted once a month in the future to improve the quality of each factory's products.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the administration's southward transportation quota for yarn and cloth last month was 4,141 pieces of yarn and 104,874 bolts of cloth.

<p>Yesterday, the artificial silk market continued the momentum of the previous day, with prices rising sharply in the morning. No. 120 Dongyang was priced at 3.85 million yuan. Takayama and Asahi were priced at 800,000 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon, but because silk weaving businesses could pick up their allocated silk on Monday and the 21st installment has also been applied for, the atmosphere outside the market felt weak. Dongyang's asking price receded to 700,000 yuan. There were buyers for Takayama and Asahi at 600,000 yuan, but holders asked for 700,000 yuan without any transactions. Factory yarns were still sluggish yesterday. Only the D grade was being sold in a few loads at 5.25 million yuan. There were no other inquiries. Silk fabrics improved slightly yesterday.

<h3>Flannel is Becoming Popular</h3>
<p>Yesterday, all glossy flannel woven from fine wool thread was becoming increasingly popular in the market. Wholesale prices were all exceeding the red line. This was partly due to the strong demand from fabric stores and the strict import controls, making it difficult to import in the future. At the same time, the factory was raising prices round after round, which further stimulated people's emotions. Given the limited inventory, insufficient production, and the obstructed source of foreign goods, those in the industry were all delighted with the prospects for spring season coat and suit flannel sales.</p>
<h3>Social Bureau Sells Large Quantities of Government Rice; Rice Prices Still Rise Secretly; Food Market is Chaotic and Unsettled</h3>
<p>The total supply of rice from the north and south markets was more than 2,700 shi. The amount of Saigon rice allocated to both markets totaled 10,600 bags, and prices remained the same.

Only Bai Yuan and Yin Yuan saw some trading, with prices soaring by 4,000-5,000 yuan. Prices secretly rose by 3,000-5,000 yuan outside the market. The rising trend of miscellaneous grains and oilcakes was also sharp, causing chaos. Flour continued to rise by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Bran rose another 1,000 yuan. Bean cakes were expensive due to costly raw materials, and sellers were firm on their prices, soaring by 1,100-1,200 yuan. The oil market saw turbulent fluctuations, with raw oil soaring by over 10,000 yuan. Bean oil remained scarce, while vegetable oil felt more stable. Sesame oil was also unchanged. Cooking oil was fair. Soybean oil factories needed raw materials and were strongly purchasing, and local retailers were also greedy for it. However, the supply was limited, demand exceeded supply, and prices continued to leap by 5,000-6,000 yuan. Red beans and broad beans also followed the rise of other goods, increasing by 3,000-4,000 yuan. Corn alcohol demand was still strong, rising sharply by 6,000-7,000 yuan. Wheat was scarce and valuable, soaring by 8,000-9,000 yuan. Sesame prices rose by 6,000-7,000 yuan.

Shantou Jieyang Qing was 95,000-96,000 yuan, and Shunde Qing was 94,000-95,000 yuan, totaling about 200 bags. Xinghua white was 150,000-145,000 yuan, and Xinxing red was 114,500-114,600 yuan.

<h3>Tea Market Opens at a High Price; Wu Chang Purchases Chen Chouzhen at 155,000 Yuan Per Load</h3>

<h3>Flour Rationing Will Not Be Interrupted</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Convened Relevant People for a Discussion. If Reserves Are Insufficient, the Ministry of Food and China Trust Will Provide Supply.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Mayor Wu convened a discussion meeting with people related to flour at the City Hall at 5:30 pm yesterday. Those who attended included Pang Songzhou, Director of the Ministry of Food, Director Wang, Liu Gongyun, Ji Mingzhai, Wu Limen, Xi Debing, Zhu Maoqiu, Qian Shouchun, Zhang Chao, and Gu Zhunian.

<h3>Cotton Yarn Prices Jump Wildly by 500,000 to 600,000</h3>
<p>Reduced Rationing of Textiles for Construction is Also a Contributing Factor</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was booming. Many buyers gathered early in the morning, and prices jumped by 100,000.

It is said that the quota of textiles allocated for construction the previous night was greatly reduced. Each yarn merchant only had one piece of 10-count Shuiyue. Both 32-count and 42-count were unavailable, so the rising trend became more intense. 42-count twisted yarn returned to the 5 million mark, but there were still few suppliers.</p>
<h3>Responsible Person of the Cigarette Factory Association Discusses the Reason for the Price Increase of Cigarettes</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] After the Lunar New Year, the price of cigarettes in this city has been unusually high. The prices of various domestic and foreign cigarettes have increased by an average of 60% to 70%. According to a responsible person of the Cigarette Factory Association, since the import of foreign cigarettes has been prohibited, the production and sales of domestic cigarettes have generally increased. The total production of domestic cigarette factories in the city in December last year was 135,000 cases. The production volume in January was slightly lower than that in December due to the Spring Festival holidays and labor strikes. The reasons for this price increase are, on the one hand, the increase in tax by 25% to 30%, and on the other hand, the decrease in the import volume of foreign tobacco leaves. The supply of domestic tobacco leaves is insufficient. At the same time, foreign cigarette prices have risen, and domestic cigarette prices are inevitably rising. The wholesale prices of various cigarette factories, except for previous orders, have increased by 50% to 100% compared to the previous prices. Currently, various cigarette factories are applying for foreign exchange to order tobacco leaves from foreign countries to make up for the shortage of domestic tobacco leaves, he said.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Tea is Developing Abroad: The Second Batch of Tea Shipped to the United States Has Been Packed; Taiwan Cancels Tea Export Tax</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 1st] Following the first batch of 7,500 boxes of Taiwan tea shipped to the United States, the second batch of 5,000 boxes of oolong tea has now been packed. As soon as a foreign ship is negotiated, it will be shipped directly from Keelung Port to New York for sale. Taiwan Tea Company is currently planning to ship tea to the United Kingdom and Africa for trial sales to expand the international market. According to the company, the selling price of the first batch of tea shipped to the United States, converted from US dollars to Taiwan dollars at the official exchange rate, is only 40 yuan per pound, while the production cost of Taiwan tea is 80 yuan per pound. If the government does not subsidize it, it will be difficult to maintain. This matter has now been submitted to the central government for approval. The Taiwan Provincial Government has now decided to abolish the tea export tax from February 1st to encourage tea exports. The 60 million yuan loan for the Taiwan Tea Company's Fuxing Tea Plantation has also been fully allocated, with 1,500 yuan lent per jia (equivalent to 14.5 mu). It is expected to restore tea plantations to 40,000 jia this year, according to last year’s entire province which only had 20,000 jia.</p>
<h3>Tea Evaluation Meeting to be Held Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Black Market for Klim Milk Powder is Expected to be Eliminated Soon</h3>
<p>Recently, Klim milk powder has been quite scarce in the market, and the black market is rampant. It has recently been learned from the exclusive manager in China, Jishi Foreign Company, that three batches of Klim milk powder have already been shipped, totaling 450,000 pounds, all of which have been unloaded at the designated customs warehouse.

<h3>British, Indian, Chinese and Italian Companies are Competing in the Singapore Cotton Textile Market</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Singapore, January 31st] Although the price of textiles in Singapore has fallen by half in the past three months, it is still three times higher than before the war. Since the liberation period, the price of black market textiles has fallen by 300%, and almost 60% in the past two months. An importer said that the price drop is actually due to the fact that the textiles purchased for export to neighboring areas are still restricted and cannot be exported, resulting in them being stockpiled in Singapore. A Chinese importer said that the cloth imported from Hong Kong recently must be sold at a loss, regardless of the cost, because cheap Italian cloth has taken the opportunity to attack. The importer also said that the price of cloth is expected to plummet because light-weight cloth from Shanghai has been unloaded in Hong Kong, indicating that the weather will turn cold next month. European importers are also importing from Manchester and other parts of the UK. The prices are more affordable than Hong Kong goods, and the quality is also better, with better cotton yarn and wider width than Hong Kong imports. However, British spinning mills are currently unable to supply in large quantities. Indian exporters are also importing cloth into Singapore, which is slightly cheaper than Hong Kong goods and slightly more expensive than British goods, but the quality is mostly poor.</p>

It is noted that the first National Education Conference was held in May of the 17th year of the Republic of China, the second was held in April of the 19th year, and the third was held in the 28th year.</p>
<h3>National Science Conference</h3>
<p>Academia Sinica and the Ministry of Education to Prepare This Year</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] Academia Sinica and the Ministry of Education have decided to prepare for the National Science Conference this year, and the Department of Higher Education is responsible for the preparation.</p>
<h3>Results of Scientific Tests: The Prodigy Has No Genius</h3>
<p>Zhang Qingyun's Intelligence is Similar to That of Ordinary Children</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] It was previously rumored that a prodigy, Zhang Qingyun, was discovered in Changzhou. Newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai have published articles about him. The Ministry of Education's specialist, Mr. Du Nianjia, was on his way back to Zhejiang, so Minister Zhu Jiahua ordered him to visit Changzhou on his way to investigate. If the child was indeed a genius, the state could take care of him and educate him. Mr. Du used four methods to test the child's intelligence: one was a picture completion test, the results of which were the same as those of ordinary kindergarten students; one was a mechanical memory test, the results of which showed that he was mentally retarded; one was a shape and number alternation test, and one was a maze test. The results of these two aspects were similar to those of ordinary children. According to the results of this scientific test, it can be determined that Zhang Qingyun is not a genius. The reason why he can attract attention is only because he can write cursive script, and is limited to large characters. Regular script and small characters are ordinary. This should be the result of forced education. Zhang Tong is still being raised by Mr. and Mrs. Zhang, the brigade commander of the First Brigade of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army.</p>

<p>In the first match, the women's Qinglian team faced the women's Qingzi team. After the game started, Qingzi's Jian Zhiguang and Qian Chuping scored back and forth, gaining many points, and led by a wide margin of 17-6 in the first half. Switching sides to resume the battle, Qinglian gradually showed improvement, with Xu Peizhen, Sun Fengzhu, and Liu Huishan scoring quickly in succession. Qingzi, on the other hand, revealed many flaws. In the third quarter, Qinglian took a narrow lead of 20-19 by one point.

When time ran out, Chenyou easily defeated Peer 56-22.</p>
<p>All Blacks Team Unable to Withstand, Shantou Team Declares Victory</p>
<p>In the final match, Grade A First Division Shantou team faced All Blacks team. After the whistle sounded, the two sides were in a stalemate for a long time. All Blacks finally found an opportunity to pass the ball into the center, and He Xiaoxian turned and hooked it in, scoring the first point. Shantou's Chen Qingjiang responded in kind, and Lin Weicong made a successful long shot. All Blacks' Zhang Shaoqing did not want to be outdone, and also made a successful long shot, forcing a tie. Chen Qingjiang and Lin Weicong scored respectively, giving Shantou an 8-4 lead. All Blacks were unwilling to be outdone, and Zhang Shaoqing and Lu Dazhen each scored, allowing All Blacks to come from behind. Shantou called a timeout for a secret discussion, which proved effective, resulting in another tie. Shantou intensified its offensive, and in the first half, Shantou took a 23-15 lead. Switching sides and adjusting their lineup to resume the battle, Shantou's offensive remained strong. Lin Weicong scored first, followed by He Lide scoring. Shantou's score soared straight up. After five minutes, they held an absolute advantage of 35-15. The All Blacks gradually became unable to withstand the pressure, and Shantou became even more rampant. Lu Dazhen re-entered the game and replaced Tao Shaosheng, regaining two points, which boosted morale. However, time was running out. When time was up, All Blacks suffered a crushing defeat of 41-63 to Shantou.</p>

<h3>Hua Central Region Games Open: Basketball Game Hubei Wins Over Jiangxi</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Hankou, 1st] The Hua Central Region Five-Province Games opened this afternoon. Chairman Wan specially presented two victory tripods as trophies. The first match was the basketball game between Hubei and Jiangxi provinces, with Hubei winning over Jiangxi 43-26.</p>
<h3>Friendly Soccer Match: Youyou Defeats Jiaotong University; Score: 1-0</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Jiaotong University's Director of Sports Chen Ling, in order to allow the school's soccer team to observe and learn, yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, invited the city's strong team Youyou for a friendly match at the school's soccer field. The audience was unexpectedly large, surrounding the field five layers deep, with about seven or eight thousand people, creating an unprecedented grand scene. As a result, Youyou won 4-2, with Jiaotong University taking the lead 1-0 in the first half.</p>
<p>Jiaotong University, with the wind at their backs and facing the sun, took the initiative to attack, with strong momentum. The goal of Youyou was in imminent danger for a while. Goalkeeper Zhang Rongcai was busy dealing with the attacks. After fifteen minutes, Jiaotong University's forward advanced again. Zheng Jingtong passed to the right, and Wang Hongshu shot and scored, opening the scoring. Jiaotong University gained an advantage, and morale was high. However, despite having many opportunities, their shots were still weak, and they did not achieve any further results. In the first half, Jiaotong University had an advantage of 1-0.</p>
<p>During the break, Chen Ling treated the guests with Coca-Cola, and the Jiaotong University students were also delighted. Unexpectedly, when the game resumed, the veterans of Youyou launched a counterattack. Ba Ma dribbled the ball into Jiaotong University's goal area. Qin Dingxin, quick-witted and agile, threw himself forward to push the ball out. Cao Qinfang, seizing the opportunity, flew forward and gently sent the ball in, tying the score. Before long, Zhu Meilong passed the ball forward from the sideline. Jiaotong University's goalkeeper jumped up but failed to catch the ball. Liu Longsheng, in a moment of desperation, scored an own goal, putting Youyou ahead 2-1. Youyou's offensive then became even tighter. Zhu Meineng scored with a bicycle kick, making it 3-1. Jiaotong University's Zheng Jingtong regained one goal, but less than half a minute later, Youyou's Ba Ma retaliated in kind, scoring a goal single-handedly, making it 4-2. As a result, Youyou emerged victorious 4-2.</p>
<h3>Letter of Correction</h3>
<p>Regarding the news about the dismissal of our school's Principal Hang published in your newspaper's Suzhou correspondence on January 31, it is completely untrue. The alleged sale of received materials is entirely fabricated and there is absolutely no such thing as a dismissal investigation. We are deeply concerned that the outside world may misunderstand the truth and cause confusion. Therefore, we are writing to request a correction. Sincerely, the Faculty and Staff Association of Jiangsu Provincial Suzhou Middle School (January 31)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Decides to Open Up National Textbook</h3>
<p>Standardization; Implementation Method Still Under Planning</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Regarding the curriculum standards and editing guidelines for the standardized textbooks, the Ministry of Education will convene meetings separately, inviting experts from both inside and outside the ministry to discuss together. This is because the old curriculum standards are no longer suitable, and the editing work being exclusively handled by the National Institute for Compilation and Translation is also worthy of consideration. Furthermore, regarding distribution, the Ministry of Education has decided to open it up, no longer exclusively operated by the Seven-Association Office. This is because the original contract stated that it would expire at the end of March this year and end at the end of July. However, the implementation method of opening it up is still being carefully planned by the ministry.</p>
<h3>Football League Grade A Match: Longhu and Longjie Meet Youtai Today; Starting at 2:30 PM at Yiyuan</h3>
<p>Today, the Grade A Football League match between the Longjie and Youtai teams will begin at 2:30 PM at the Yiyuan Stadium. Tickets are priced at $2,000 and $5,000, and will be sold at the Municipal Gymnasium on Shaanxi South Road starting at 12:30 PM. In addition to the Grade A match, there will also be nine other matches, including the Grade C League, the Youth Cup semi-finals, and friendly matches, starting at 9:00 AM at the various stadiums in Hongkou Zhengzheng Park. Tickets will not be sold.</p>
<p>Since being promoted to Grade A, Longjie's performance has been satisfactory. Under the leadership of Chairman Cui Shifu, management is strict and training is serious. It is expected that they will win again today against Youtai.</p>
<p>Youtai has always been known as a dark horse, and their combat power is unpredictable. The team suffered a defeat by Longjie in the first round. Today, they will definitely seek revenge. Defender Mania has not returned from his trip to Hong Kong with the inter-city team, and will be replaced by Rishibao and Xue Pansiting. With goalkeeper McNitti, who has the reputation of an iron gate, the match between them and Longjie today will surely be a great battle.</p>

<h3>Crossing the North American Continent: Five Days, Ten Thousand Miles (2)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>Sing! California! Home of Fruit and Gold</p>
<p>California, 15th Dispatch</p>
<p>California, the "Jiangnan" of America, the birthplace of fruit, the home of gold.</p>
<p>California enjoys an unfading spring, and uninterrupted warm sunshine. In winter, the streets of New York are dark and damp, and the lakes of Chicago are covered with snow. However, California still enjoys boundless spring scenery. Friends saw me wearing gloves, a scarf, and a heavy woolen coat, and laughed from the bottom of their hearts: "What a New Yorker look! You don't need any of that here!"</p>
<p>Nevada - State of Wealth and Adventure, Paradise for Adventurers</p>
<p>The train travels from Nevada into California, crossing eight hours of long slopes. On the eastern side of the slope, the white snow covers the body, and the valleys are sparse. Nevada is like a Swiss mountain country landscape, with many small market towns scattered like embellishments in the mountains and fields. At night, the wide rainbow lights are dazzling. A fellow passenger told me: Nevada is the strangest state in America. It is the Gibraltar of the British Empire, the Morocco of France, and the Macau of China. He pointed out to me many "nightclubs" and "clubs" illuminated by neon lights, all of which are aliases for gambling dens. The economic lifeline of Nevada relies on gamblers from all over America, even Canada, who have worked hard for a year or half a year, and come here to "gamble heavily." Therefore, in every town in Nevada, there are exquisite hotels, restaurants, and game halls, whose business is somewhat distorted and relies on the abnormal "gambling industry."</p>
<p>Because each state has the right to make its own laws, Nevada created that peculiar set of laws. For private gambling dens, the regulation is that each "gambling table" pays a tax of sixty dollars every three months, so that its "commission gambling" is legally protected. The relationship of marriage is defined very conveniently in Nevada's laws, so Nevada has produced two world-famous divorce cities: Reno and Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Nevada is a paradise for adventurers and a "heaven" of extravagance. A passenger boarding the train in Nevada said: In the past, prostitution was not permitted by law in any city in Nevada. Since this war, it has become popular. The reason is that during the war, many troops were stationed in Nevada, and some adventurous speculators created this "new business." Over time, it became a habit, and the law was loosely enforced.</p>
<p>"Pacific College." The Oldest Institution of Higher Learning in Stockton, California</p>
<p>(Contributed by Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing)</p>
<p>One Night in Sacramento, Capital of California</p>
<p>I did not get off the train in any city in Nevada. Overnight, the train crossed the high mountains of eastern California.</p>
<p>The first impression of California is "clean." The fields, residences, small bridges and flowing water, and even the evergreen forests and fruit countries, all give people a refreshing feeling. Americans are not necessarily all clean, but in California, there is definitely no feeling of messiness like in New York, nor is there an impression of dirtiness like in Chicago.</p>
<p>I stayed for a day in Sacramento, the capital of California. There, I heard many stories of California:</p>
<p>California's opening up to modern civilization is only ninety-nine years old. The first hero to discover this new world was James Marshall. In January 1848, Marshall discovered the gold mine near Coloma. It is said that the discovery at that time was very accidental. The gold mine was distributed on both sides of the American River, which is a small river that connects San Francisco to Sacramento and runs through the east and west of California. Later, overseas Chinese called San Francisco "Gold Mountain," which is why it got that name.</p>
<p>From Marshall to the present, in ninety-nine years, California has been a territory of Spain. Even now, the architecture of Stanford University is still in the Spanish style.</p>
<p>The development of California has the modern civilization brought by the Anglo-Saxon nation, the management of the Spanish and Mexicans (they were originally one family), and the blood and sweat of Chinese Guangdong overseas Chinese. When California was "liberated" from Spanish rule and merged into the United States of America, Mexico sent 118,000 people to help California fight. I saw that when the new president of Mexico took office at the end of last year, the governor of California, Warren, gave a very sincere speech. He particularly emphasized the friendship between Mexico and California, saying that he was willing to be responsible for carrying forward this traditional friendship.</p>
<p>Governor Warren, California's Premier Figure</p>
<p>Warren is a re-elected governor, and is the unique idol of today's California. A person with a graceful appearance and strong political skills. California was originally the basic territory of the Republican Party. The Republican Party has a strong backstage support. The Nolan father and son of California's "machine" are both strong supporters of Governor Warren, but Governor Warren himself often identifies as a Democrat. At the 1944 Democratic National Convention, Wallace and Byrnes competed for the vice presidency and were deadlocked. Some people suggested proposing Warren. Even now, there are still many people in California who firmly believe that their governor will become the master of the White House in two years.</p>
<p>But who says Warren is not a Republican? An American colleague said: He is a Republican of the Democratic Party, and also a Democrat of the Republican Party!</p>
<p>During last year's California gubernatorial election, there was only one name on the ballot, and he was the candidate jointly nominated by both parties.</p>
<p>I did not meet Governor Warren, but asked many California "ordinary people." They said: Warren's administration is admirable. He himself is a patriot, and he can cooperate with the conservative and orthodox political style of the Republican Party. But at the same time, he is a progressive and forward-thinking administrative leader. He never neglects labor welfare, social security systems, and various issues of veterans. I attended a session of the State Senate in Sacramento. That day, the Senate was discussing the housing shortage for veterans. Governor Warren proposed the establishment of a Veterans Housing Shortage Relief Committee, requesting the Department of Finance to allocate 100 million yuan as the committee's fund, and to allocate another 35 million yuan to immediately purchase building materials for construction in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>An administrative official lacking vigor would not do that so readily. I found that the people of California like Governor Warren as much as the people of New York like Dewey.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the state's wealth, New York and California are the two states with the largest financial revenue and expenditure. From the perspective of humanities and society, New York and California are also the two most complex states in American society.</p>
<p>The core members of New York society are Anglo-Saxons, Jews, and Italians. The main members of California society are Anglo-Saxons, Mexicans, and Chinese.</p>
<p>Stockton - Home to 2,000 Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>I took a train from Sacramento, the capital, to a small city called Stockton, where I stayed for three days. This town of 35,000 people has more than 6,000 Mexicans and more than 2,000 Chinese. Mexicans run various grocery stores and small vegetable markets. Chinese operate traditional national treasures: restaurants and laundries.</p>
<p>In this small city, I deeply experienced for the first time the so-called "racial discrimination" that I had heard about for so long.</p>
<p>California is the province with the most obvious discrimination against people of color. In the mid-19th century, our overseas Chinese, single and poor, came to this new continent to help the white people develop and create it from scratch, and have always belonged to the servant class. Therefore, the so-called white people in the West in the past had a view of other races that was not as bad as "black slaves," but only a difference in degree. Even now, California law does not allow white ladies to marry gentlemen of color. In certain cities and certain areas of California, people of color do not have the right to purchase land and houses. These unilateral restrictions are unheard of in the same United States, in New York State, in Illinois, and in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>The Situation of Racial Discrimination Is Gradually Improving</p>
<p>California State University has been constantly launching the "Anti-Racial Discrimination" movement in recent years. After the baptism of this war, the situation is gradually improving, especially in several large cities in California, such as San Francisco, Oakland, and even Los Angeles.</p>
<p>However, when I arrived in the small town of Stockton, I was infinitely surprised by the unreasonable ridicule and very impolite words of the female owner of the Lincoln Hotel.</p>
<p>The Lincoln Hotel is not large, and there are more than a dozen Chinese servants inside, from elevator operators to floor cleaners. The work they do is no different from the work done by "black slaves" in the eastern and southern United States.</p>
<p>It is easy to overthrow an enemy, but it is not easy to change a deeply ingrained national psychology that is a hundred years old. It requires the power of long-term education.</p>
<p>Even the Highest Institutions of Learning Have Chinese Students</p>
<p>Stockton is a medium-sized small city, clean and tidy, like thousands of small cities in the United States. There is a small Mickeley Lake in the city, with a towering city hall by the lake. Tram and bus transportation is very convenient.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese restaurants are concentrated on Washington Street, and there are also Chinese-style buildings, but because there are not many people, business is not very prosperous. Outside the city is the famous "Pacific College," the oldest institution of higher learning in the entire state of California. The school buildings are all 17th-century Gothic architecture, with thousands of students. There are not many Chinese students, most of whom are children of overseas Chinese. There are 60,000 to 70,000 overseas Chinese in the entire state of California. The younger generation is almost entirely educated in the United States. Teaching the children of overseas Chinese to recognize Chinese characters is a mission that is more difficult than ascending to heaven. I remember the second day I arrived in San Francisco, Mr. Liu Boji, the editor-in-chief of the local "National Daily," said to me with great sadness: "Don't expect too much from the overseas Chinese youth, or even expect them to return to the country to engage in construction, that will be disappointing." He said, "They have received 100% American education, how can you teach them to understand China?"</p>
<p>Fruit Made the Name, Gold Increased National Wealth</p>
<p>For the journey between San Francisco and Stockton, I changed my South Pacific Railroad Company train ticket to a bus. The service system and spirit of the Greyhound Bus Company are admirable. Along the way, there were two and a half hours of splendid plains, endless orchards, and endless green grass. The United States is a human paradise lacking "flowers" (because labor is too expensive), but in the Florida Peninsula and in California, even in the depths of winter, there are still flowers to see everywhere. Ninety percent of the fruit in the United States, whether it is oranges, pears, peaches, plums...all comes from Florida and California. When Mr. Zhang Yuejun decided to come to the United States, the plane landed in Honolulu. A friend in Honolulu brought him a basket of California fruit that was considered precious. Unexpectedly, the plane went east and brought it back to California. Not only did he lose double the transportation costs, but the fruit entering California was subject to a heavy import tax.</p>
<p>Fruit created the fame of California, gold increased the wealth of California, and the inexhaustible sunshine and the boundless greenness embellished the natural beauty of California. As I stepped into California, I recalled the carpenters in the American barracks singing "California, I Love You" in waves! It really has indescribable poetic charm. Sing, warriors! Sing, this American "Splendid Jiangnan"! (At the Washington Hotel in San Francisco)</p>
<h3>An International Artery: A Record of the Opening of the Shen-An Line</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper in the Northeast, Han Qingtao</p>
<p>Sent from Shenyang on the 14th</p>
<p>The Shen-An Line is open! Countless railway workers and engineers are the unsung heroes of this line. This road was the one most severely damaged by the Eighth Route Army. At the same time, it was the Soviet army that first turned it from a double track into a single track. Now, the Fanyang Railway Bureau, with scattered materials and the blood and sweat of unsung heroes, has created a great force.</p>
<p>Wang Fengrui, the Director of the Shenyang Railway Bureau, said at the celebration banquet for the opening to Andong: "Rush repair, rush repair, rush repair, desperately rush repair. The section between Gongyuan and Linjiatai took more than a month to rush through. As a result, the route is not sound, and there are not enough vehicles, because the slogan during the rush repair was 'Opening to traffic first!' The reality had to be this way. The problems from now on are rectification and restoration!"</p>
<p>On the route, the bridges and tunnels over the Taizi River, the Xi River, and the Cao River have become major projects. There are many tunnels within the 21 li, one of which is as long as 2.5 kilometers. The Communist demolition teams destroyed the tunnels by dragging locomotives into them, bombing them, and then planting landmines at the entrances. Therefore, the effort to clear the tunnels was enormous. The bridges were most thoroughly destroyed, and now most of them are open to traffic on sleepers erected at a height of 13 or 14 meters. It is dangerous and frightening. The engineers say, "There will be no problems before the thaw."</p>
<p>A Historical Account of the Shen-An Line</p>
<p>The Shen-An Line starts from Andong, passing through Fenghuangcheng, Jiguan Mountain, Lianshanguan, Qiaotou, Gongyuan, Benxihu, and reaching the Sujiatun Station, which is more than 15 kilometers south of the center of Shenyang City. (From here to the center of Panyang City, it merges with the Zhongchang Railway), with a total length of 261 kilometers, 25 culverts, and 205 bridges.</p>
<p>Initially, it was built eight years before the founding of the Republic of China. When the Russo-Japanese War broke out, the Japanese army repelled the Russian army on the banks of the Yalu River and occupied Fenghuangcheng in early May. At that time, because the transportation of grain and fodder became an urgent matter, the Japanese Railway Corps began to lay a light railway between Andong and Fenghuangcheng. The project was completed on November 3 of the same year, with a length of 61 kilometers.</p>
<p>By February 11, seven years before the founding of the Republic of China, it had been extended from Fenghuangcheng to Xiamatang, and then directly to Liaoyang. Subsequently, with the progress of the war, it was changed to be built from Qiaotou to Shenyang. The entire line was completed on December 3 of the same year, and the first traffic between Shenyang and Andong was held on December 15.</p>
<p>In April, one year before the founding of the Republic of China, the money was inherited and managed by "Mantetsu", and the standard gauge track (4 feet 8 and a half inches) was rebuilt. The survey was completed three years before the founding of the Republic of China, and the route was determined. Construction began in August of the same year, and the entire line started operations on November 1, one year before the founding of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Later, when the Pacific War broke out, the Japanese, in order to enhance transportation capacity, had a plan to duplicate the main line of the continent. Therefore, they added double tracks starting in 1942, and the entire line was completed in August 1944. After August 15, the Soviet army dismantled and transported away one of the new tracks of the double track, leaving an old single line. Then the Communist army arrived and greatly damaged it. After the rush repair and opening to traffic, there was no longer the convenience of transportation in the past.</p>
<p>Economic Outlook Along the Line</p>
<p>The Shen-An Line is located in the mountainous area of the Changbai Mountain system. From Yaoqianhutun in Shenyang County to the vicinity of Lianshanguan in the south, the peaks are stacked and the trees are lush, so forest products are famous. The people are half woodcutters and half farmers. On the slopes, tussah silkworms can be raised, and a large number of silk cocoons are exported from Andong every year.</p>
<p>At the southern end of this line, China and North Korea are bounded by the Yalu River. Its tributaries include the Hun River and the Cao River, which flow into the Taizi River. There are also the Tang River and the Xi River, which all flow into the Yellow Sea. These rivers help farmers in irrigation and engage in the development of rice fields.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits are quite rich along the line, famous for coal and iron. In addition, limestone, copper, tin, lead, sulfur, asbestos, cement, muscovite, etc., have considerable output. The eastern end of the railway is near Andong, and the western end is west of Yaoqianhutun in Shenyang County. Some are close to the mountains, and some are close to the rivers. It is a plain, and most of it has been reclaimed into farmland, but it only accounts for 99% of the total area, so food production is insufficient, and supplies still need to be imported from other places.</p>
<p>The economy along the line was oppressed by the enemy and puppets for fourteen years. The production of agriculture and forestry and the operation of industry and commerce were all in the hands of the enemy. In addition, the conscription of labor made people miserable.</p>
<p>After August 15, the rivers and mountains were restored. The Communist army entered the railway line area, and most of the factories such as papermaking, hemp manufacturing, rubber, and textiles were destroyed. In addition, the issuance of paper money made the people feel very distressed. Recently, people's livelihood has been slightly restored. In the future, when transportation is restored and factories start work, it may not be difficult to step into the grand view.</p>
<p>Prospects for Transportation</p>
<p>The Shen-An Line is not only a main line of transportation between China and Korea and mainland Japan, but also a hub for connecting Europe and Asia, and bears considerable responsibility for the exchange of passengers and goods in various places. After the war, with the changes in the situation, transportation between the Northeast and Korea was cut off. At present, it is only a main railway line within China. Although it no longer has the status of an international main railway line, it bears a great mission for military transportation on the national border.</p>
<p>Underground along the line, there are abundant resources, making Benxihu and Andong become bases for light and heavy industry. Unfortunately, the industrial facilities have been destroyed and it is difficult to recover for a while. Although the transportation on this line has been rushed to restore, compared with the previous situation, there is a "world of difference" except for coal transportation.</p>
<p>However, agricultural products, forest products, and coal on the route provide a large supply for domestic needs and urban consumption. Once industry is restored, the underground resources of this route must also be urgently mined. If transportation with Korea is restored, it will not be difficult to regain the important position of international and national border main lines.</p>
<p>During the enemy and puppet period, it was subject to wartime control. In addition to passing passengers, most of them transported workers engaged in industrial production, so most of them were production passengers. In the future, most of them will be consumption passengers. If the economy is restored and security is consolidated, then passengers traveling between Andong, Shenyang, Changchun, Dalian and various parts of Guan Nei will inevitably increase, and transportation will inevitably become more prosperous day by day.</p>
<p>Coal is produced along the line, with Benxihu being the most famous. "Gongtianqian" has Tianshifu, the center station, and "Fenghuanqian" has Saimaji as the second. Before August 15, most of it was transported to Benxihu and Anshan for iron smelting. After that, it will be used for railway families and general industry and commerce, so coal is the first in freight transportation.</p>
<p>Benxihu and Andong both had cement factories during the puppet Manchukuo period, so the amount of iron ore, limestone, etc. transported was quite large. Now it is only wood and gravel. Assuming that Northeast industry recovers and resources are developed, the progress of transportation is not without great hope.</p>
<p>Agricultural products along the Shen-An Line are mostly supplied for local consumption, but soybeans, bean cakes, bean oil, etc. are also occasionally exported from Andong and Datong to overseas markets. After the restoration of security, sorghum, corn and other male grains may also be transported to Shenyang and Guan Nei. As for the special products of Andong and Fenghuangcheng, there is more hope for tobacco exports.</p>
<p>The wood in the upper reaches of the Yalu River was mostly bundled into rafts and floated down the river to Andong for lumber and papermaking. Later, due to the construction of the Shuifeng Hydropower Plant, most of it was transported from "North Manchuria". If the "Fenghuan Line" can be connected to Diandian, the transportation of wood will be more promising. The most important thing is that the sorghum rice and firewood along the line are all in excess of demand, and it is also necessary to transport them out.</p>
<p>Observing the current factories, such as Andong papermaking, textile, and tussah silk factories, can be revived. The movement of raw materials and products mostly relies on railway transportation. The food, groceries, etc. used along the line are also transported from Shenyang to various places by railway. According to general observations, once the economy is restored, the busy transportation will often be more than in the past.</p>
<p>Restoration and Rush Repair</p>
<p>The restoration project and the rush repair project of the Shen-An Line can be divided into three sections. The first section is between Sujiatun and Gongyuan. The damage here, in terms of houses and tracks, except for the complete section from Sujiatun to Wujiatun, most of the rest was demolished. Twenty-three bridges were damaged, a total of 45 holes, with a total length of 407 meters. One mountain tunnel was broken, and the vault cracked 270 meters. After Wang Fengrui, the Director of the Shenyang Railway Bureau, and his employees tried every possible means, the restoration work was completed on December 21.</p>
<p>The second section is between Gongyuan and Qiaotou. The damage is as follows: the pier of Bridge No. 17 on the Xi River was destroyed, the route was slightly damaged, the Qiaotou Station was completely destroyed, and the Fujinling Tunnel was partially destroyed. After rush repairs, the obstacles in the tunnel were removed and bridges were erected, and traffic was rushed through in June.</p>
<p>The third section is between Qiaotou and Andong. The damage was really serious. The bridges, tunnels, roadbeds, and steel rails between Qiaotou and Caohekou were completely destroyed. The damage between Caohekou and Fenghuangcheng was lighter. Except for a few damages to the money in the station, the situation between Fenghuangcheng and Andong was good. Twenty-six bridges were destroyed in this area, with a total of 66 holes and a total length of 1160 meters.</p>
<p>At that time, a rush repair general team was dispatched, divided into four major teams, each responsible for rush repairs in the designated section. The first team was from Qiaotou to Lianshanguan, the second team was from Lianshanguan to Liujiahe, the third team was from Liujiahe to Fenghuangcheng, and the fourth team was from Fenghuangcheng to Andong.</p>
<p>The sleepers, steel rails, and accessories used in the above three sections of rush repairs were mostly collected and purchased along the line, and branch lines and side money were dismantled. Under the lack of manpower, material resources, and financial resources, they overcame difficulties, worked hard to rush repairs, and finally completed this arduous task and achieved the mission of opening to traffic.</p>
<p>In the process of rushing to repair the road, in addition to the engineers who did not avoid hardships, the most touching thing was the line district workers, that is, the road classes that ordinary people said. They dedicated all their strength, even their lives, in the icy and snowy weather. They stood in line and watched the train pass by. In their silent silence and hard work, they saw their joy. However, their clothes were not warm enough to keep out the cold, and their shivering appearance was unbearable to see, because they could only receive some maintenance fees!</p>

<h3>Random Thoughts on New Films</h3>
<p>— Ma Boliang</p>
<p>Distant Love</p>
<p>Qin Yi, this is the first time I have seen her serene beauty, a tragic change in her eyes, clear as autumn water, like the fountain in the writings of the French contemporary poet Baudelaire, needing no words. Under the pale moon of a good night, gazing at people, a pure melancholy, what is serene beauty? It is the language of these eyes, telling of an era. But the era taught progress and backwardness, the progressive ones walking higher and farther, the backward ones only becoming destitute and displaced, having eaten plain noodles, uttering lofty opinions in vain, wearing a pitiful face of wanting to cry but having no tears. Do not laugh at him, this is precisely ourselves. Whoever cannot surpass the boundaries of the era will remain behind, shaking and trembling, looking utterly embarrassed. The love in life is also just a shameful delusion. At the end of the film, Qin Yi's eyes look through this distant distance, the smoke of the era.</p>
<p>Zhao Dan profoundly portrays a declining intellectual of the petty bourgeoisie. He expresses the character's personality with personal emotions. The play is acted with emotion, clear and distinct. The life of a tattered defeatist is engulfed in the dust behind that car. Zhao Dan is indeed an extraordinary actor. In the first half, his cane and hat have a farcical flavor, but in the second half, it is a clear self-mockery. Zhao Dan's acting still has a kind of harmonious roundness. This means that the level of an actor's cultivation can create a realm.</p>
<p>Chen Liting's choice of material is admirable. Although he ignores the question of whether women should not be allowed to be good wives and mothers, recently, few directors have approached the era like him, so outstandingly creating living types. His directing technique is delicate and clear, but in the delicacy, there is sometimes a sense of stagnation. The tempo of the second half is not consistent with the first half.</p>
<p>The three of them call "Distant Love" and order us to ask ourselves, with half of George Sand's question: "Why do you want to do this? What's the use? What does it mean?" Think about it.</p>
<p>Jade Hall Riches</p>
<p>Looking at the world through a funhouse mirror, absurd and happy, happy to the point of being completely muddled. Even a milkman can become a boxing king, Jue Fei goes crazy. Fang Peilin once criticized American song and dance films, believing that the dancers in the song and dance troupes are just like that, every film has these few extras, and once you get used to them, you don't feel that there is any color. The group of Indian-dressed dancers in "Golden Horse Jade Hall" is an example. Many dancers standing in the back row on the side are short-legged and thick, middle-aged, and have no beauty at all. "Jade Hall Riches" alone is able to be outstanding. Under Goldwyn's vision, although the girls of the Goldwyn class are dressed in the same black and yellow, their demeanors are beautiful, and each one still reflects each other's beauty, like the concubines of the six palaces, gathered together. Wearing red and wearing green on the stairs, walking down the steps gracefully, they are also competing for beauty and charm, and each is a beauty. This point alone is enough to dazzle people. "Night After Night," "Golden Horse Jade Hall," "Yang Nv Nv," and "Splendid Paradise" are naturally inferior. Therefore, in terms of sound and color, "Jade Hall Riches" can indeed entertain people.</p>
<p>The protagonist, Danny Kaye, originally I had no good feelings for him, just as I dislike the newly emerging group of comedians. This time I discovered his loveliness. When he is not making funny faces, he is sometimes quite gentle. There is very little of the "self-mutilation" type of hard comedy. Even if he is playing a comedic role, I feel that some authenticity is needed. Boxing and kicking must be avoided, and nakedness is especially taboo. Civilized comedy is superior. If you talk about cross-dressing, then "Charley's Aunt" is already the pinnacle and cannot be copied again. Danny Kaye, if he doesn't make strange accents, can surpass Ray Milland two or three times. As for exaggerated components, it cannot be overdone and flow into oiliness, but if it is Chaplin's satire, it may be strengthened, because that is digging bitterness. The stronger it is, the deeper the ridicule of reality is. To the deepest extent, Tsurumi Yusuke's words can be used, "Humor and tears are sometimes only separated by a thin piece of paper."</p>
<p>Virginia Mayo's cheeks are rounder and not suitable for high hairstyles. Her hair is draped flat, which makes her look radiant. Her figure also becomes slender because of this. Her figure in the cicada-winged nightgown is more graceful than showing her thighs in "The Princess and the Pirate." Virginia in the color film is also lovely, but I really worry about her. She has no special talent in song and dance, and her acting skills have not been perfected, so it is a pity that she lost a promising future. Vera-Ellen is fat and round, slightly similar to Shirley Temple. Her dance skills are agile and brisk. She has only just shown her talent and is already popular.</p>
<p>Northern Pursuit</p>
<p>Warner Bros. no longer makes Western martial arts films like "They Died with Their Boots On," but still cannot forget hero worship, letting Errol Flynn change a fighting scene, going to the icy mountains and snowfields of Canada to fight against the Nazis. The development of the story is fairly clear and smooth, and the director is competent, reflecting the meanness and cruelty of the Nazi officers, using the shooting of Errol's companions and his own comrades, chasing and killing Indian guides, etc. In general, it has made some achievements. Hans von Twardowski, who plays the Nazi officer, is famous for his good performance in this type of role, and he is indeed not weak. The heroine is, as usual, a foil. Julie Bishop's appearance is slightly thin, but fortunately, she has her own charm, and she deserves Errol Flynn's handsome and brave appearance. "Northern Pursuit" is actually a relatively inferior ordinary film from Warner Bros., and it is rare to have advantages.</p>
<h3>About "To Each His Own"</h3>
<p>— Xin Ming</p>
<p>Because of the success of "The Lost Weekend," Charles Brackett won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay in 1945. Last year, he completed "To Each His Own" for Paramount Pictures. The subject matter of the two films is absolutely different, but people in the film city are unanimously praised.</p>
<p>The story of "To Each His Own" runs through the two world wars. A girl named Jody Norris met a battle-worn soldier during World War I. Their opinions coincided, and they were finally caught up in the vortex of love, but they did not hold a wedding, and she had already secretly conceived a child. When the day of delivery came, he died on the battlefield again. So, wouldn't this child become an "illegitimate child"? Therefore, Jody passed the child to a friend's wife with tears. Twenty years later, her biological child did not recognize his own mother. Olivia de Havilland plays the important protagonist of Jody, with a heart-wrenching performance, and the development of her personality is even more profound; it is her most successful film since "Gone with the Wind" and "Hold Back the Dawn." According to the criticism of various Hollywood magazines, it is speculated that Havilland has a good chance of winning the Academy Award for 1946. The male protagonist of the film, John Lund, is still a virgin work on the screen for the first time, and the director is Mitchell Leisen, director of "Hold Back the Dawn."</p>
<h3>Why Don't Benefit Performances Sell?</h3>
<p>— Feng Chang</p>
<p>Benefit performances have been performed a lot of times, right!</p>
<p>However, according to the results of the performances, the box office is not satisfactory. Various newspapers have reported this news. Why?</p>
<p>People seem to not often treat it as a benefit performance, but just as a certain theater has invited Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu to sing a cooperative play on the same stage. Why is that?</p>
<p>We can answer these two questions comprehensively:</p>
<p>(1) The performance days are too many, breaking the record of previous benefit performances.</p>
<p>(2) The repertoire is not like a benefit performance, but very much like a cooperative play; even if it is like a benefit performance, everyone is slighting the head, and they may see its strengths, so it does not raise the interest of ticket buyers.</p>
<p>(3) Although the ticket price has fallen from the initially discussed 100,000 to 60,000, it is still too expensive.</p>
<p>(4) The ticket price is expensive, and since tickets cannot be sold at the door, the ticket sales performance is also poor.</p>
<p>As a result, the above two facts are created.</p>
<p>First, the number of performance days is too many, breaking the record of previous benefit performances; although it is one of the reasons, in reality, this reason and the fact are mutually cyclical, because if you say that it is just because the box office of the previous performance was not good, so you sing another performance, it can also be said to be a reason, but this year's Chinese New Year is even more difficult, so there are more institutions that need relief, so the benefit performance is connected again and again is also one of the reasons. To break this point, it is inevitable to bring a bit of sadness.</p>
<p>Second, regarding the repertoire problem, I don't want to describe it in detail, because I have already talked about it in last week's issue. At the same time, they themselves are most aware of this point. The later performances arranged for Mei Lanfang to sing the finale and Cheng Yanqiu to sing the penultimate were improvements to avoid all slighted head plays. Also, Mei Lanfang's "Farewell My Concubine" used Yuan Shihai instead of Liu Lianrong, which was a repentance of breaking the bad habit that big actors singing in plays must be matched with actors from their own classes. But why can this be broken? Isn't it because the business was not as ideal? This further proves "not until you see the Yellow River do you give up" and "not in times of frustration is it easy to correct mistakes (especially complacent) concepts."</p>
<p>Third, ticket prices are expensive; if there are a series of several benefit performances, and the repertoire is not particularly valuable (the so-called particularly valuable repertoire is something that cannot be seen on commercial plays with money, such as Dian Wei in "Battle of Wan City" in the past played by Yang Xiaolou, etc.), and the lineup has not added any fresh and extremely appealing personnel (the actors in this benefit performance are the actors from various stages these days. Su Zhangtuiyun and Mrs. Du were not included, and the so-called added new personnel were just a few amateur opera singers, which is very lacking in appeal, at least in this kind of Mei Cheng Tan Yang and other large cooperative benefit performances) The ticket sales mostly need to rely on the appeal of those actors, then the ticket price cannot be too expensive, at least within a reasonable range.</p>
<p>For example, "Wang Baochuan" and "Ganlu Temple", the first four performances were too slighted head to arouse the interest of opera fans, so we will not talk about them. Here, we will select two cooperative plays as explanatory materials; one is softer and one is harder.</p>
<p>(1) Mei Lanfang, Yang Baosen, etc.'s "Imperial Stele Pavilion" as the finale, Cheng Yanqiu and Tan Fuying's "June Snow" as the penultimate.</p>
<p>According to Mei Lanfang's "Imperial Stele Pavilion" is a play that he does not sing during the day, today's market price is 14,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cheng Yanqiu's "June Snow" is also posted when it is "one of two performances". Even if he sings a single performance, then the appeal of this play must be worse. The side plays must be discounted by at least 20%, so it is worth at most 16,000.</p>
<p>14,000 plus 16,000 is 30,000. The previous plays are not gifts in Mei Cheng's commercial plays in peacetime? So the price cannot be calculated. Therefore, the total value of this play is only 30,000. Now it is sold for 60,000, which can be said to exceed the actual value by one time.</p>
<p>This is relatively soft.</p>
<p>(2) Mei Lanfang and Yuan Shihai's "Farewell My Concubine" as the finale, Cheng Yanqiu's "Zhuhen Ji" as the penultimate, the previous one is</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang's "Farewell My Concubine" is worth 20,000, because Yuan Shihai is a new product, the first cooperation, maybe 5,000 can be added, Cheng Yanqiu's Zhuhen Ji, even if it is also counted as 20,000, then it is only 45,000, which is less than 15,000 compared with 60,000.</p>
<p>This is harder.</p>
<p>Both the softer and harder ones cannot reach the current set price of 60,000 yuan, no wonder opera fans are not very willing to automatically donate money to watch it, because after all, people who "enjoy giving" are not everywhere.</p>
<p>Plus fourth, the ticket sales performance is poor, then naturally these few cooperative benefit performances are not easy to sing.</p>
<h3>Blonde</h3>
<p>Judging from "Splendid Paradise," Americans seem to like blondes the most. Of the fourteen Ziegfeld girls in the film, seven have golden hair. The remaining three have red hair, three have millet hair, and one has black hair.</p>
<h3>Enlightenment from "Distant Love"</h3>
<p>— Tao Xiong</p>
<p>"Distant Love" portrays two distinct characters: one is Professor Xiao Yuanxu, a kind-hearted intellectual with theoretical knowledge but lacking practical application. The other is Yu Zhen, an uneducated village girl who, after being transformed by Xiao Yuanxu, undergoes the trials of the times and embarks on a distant road.</p>
<p>These two characters represent two kinds of love: Professor Xiao represents selfish love, loving only himself and his own family. Yu Zhen, on the other hand, loves the vast populace. Therefore, although they are husband and wife, their different perceptions and thoughts lead them to ultimately go their separate ways.</p>
<p>"Distant Love" clearly tells us that time and life are merciless. They lead the progressive towards the light and cause the regressive to fall into darkness. How much should people pay attention to themselves and to the path of life they are taking, step by step.</p>
<p>Director Chen Liting is not a passionate idealist but a down-to-earth, true artist. He introduces this pair of characters to us, allowing us to clearly see the path we should take. This pair of characters—Professor Xiao Yuanxu and Yu Zhen—are not figments of his imagination but rather two real, typical personalities he found among people. Professor Xiao represents the general decline of intellectuals who cannot keep up with the times, while Yu Zhen represents the young people who can advance with the times. Although our younger generation has been transformed by Professor Xiao, the forging of the times enables us to bravely embark on a distant road. This is indeed the case: most young people are likely to be ahead of their elders, and it must be so; otherwise, the times and society will forever remain in the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>What moves me deeply is that it enlightens us to abandon selfish love and love the vast populace!</p>

<h3>White-Haired Childlike Heart</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhongnian</p>
<p>Since ancient times, those with talent often have many affections. The news of Mr. Shi Ceng and Ms. Su Shan's marriage is truly joyful beyond expectation. Every time Mr. Shi Ceng attended a literary tea party or the Saturday literary salon, Ms. Su Shan was always his companion; conversely, every time Ms. Lin graced the occasion, Mr. Li invariably accompanied her. Once, at a joint gathering of the literary tea party and the Saturday literary salon, Mr. Li and Ms. Lin were, of course, seated together. One dish, though vegetarian, was quite greasy, so Ms. Lin used her chopsticks to take it from Mr. Li's plate, saying with a smile, "Let me eat it for you!" Although she used the polite "you" at the end, the undisguised thoughtfulness revealed to me that their relationship had long exceeded ordinary friendship, let alone a teacher-student relationship. The "exchange" in "relationship" had transformed into "affection": thus, they had long been attuned to each other, and their marriage on the second of February was merely a formality.</p>
<p>The ancients called wives "wise inner helpers." This is not me raising the anachronistic slogan of "Return to the kitchen!" but a truly profound saying: in today's world, if husband and wife cannot assist each other—note: "assist" is equal; neither is the other's slave—it's like having a lame leg among two feet! If a "wise inner helper" can also be a "wise outer helper," that is even more ideal. Years ago, I read Ms. Lin's doctoral dissertation, and in recent years, I have witnessed Ms. Lin handling the general affairs of Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory and editing "World Bi-Monthly." Recently, there was also the "exchange" of "relationship" into "affection," and today I read Mr. Li's letter of joy: "...and came to know the lady more deeply, greatly increasing my respect... Yu and I worked together on the "World" publication, discussing the philosophy of the people, sharing the same aspirations and being of like mind, truly a wise helper, so I seek to formally unite with her in marriage, hoping to assist each other in social reform; truly, Ms. Lin is the only one capable of this": all of this truly proves that Ms. Su Shan is not only a "wise inner helper" but also a "wise outer helper."</p>
<p>Some suspect that the "child" character in the title of this little congratulatory note, "White-Haired Childlike Heart," is somewhat inappropriate and should probably be "same." Ha! Ha! The brilliance lies in this "child" character! I ask: After the wedding ceremony, after drinking the nuptial cup, after being sent to the bridal chamber, the nearly "seventy"-year-old Mr. Shi Ceng, reversing the two characters of "seventy," must only have the childlike heart of "seventeen" years old! If you don't believe it, you might as well consult the marriage expert (having solved over five hundred cases), my maternal grandfather, Wu Zhihui.</p>
<h3>The Spirit of Realism in Western Art History: Nineteenth-Century British Landscape Painters</h3>
<p>— Shen Yan</p>
<p>Since the eighteenth century, the British painting world has revealed a national feeling of praising the natural beauty of its homeland. The British landscape paintings of that time were modeled after the seventeenth-century Dutch style, even tending towards imitation. Britain's soil and water are influenced by the ocean and share similar characteristics with the Netherlands, which is one of the reasons for this tendency.</p>
<p>With this kind of tradition, British landscape painting has progressed more significantly than other painting departments and has given much influence and stimulation to the European art world. Since the beginning of the nineteenth century, Britain has produced three excellent writers, namely Turner, Constable, and Bonington.</p>
<p>Turner is a unique genius in the history of landscape painting. The style of his works varies with the era of production. The nature of landscape painting also involves many aspects. Ruskin once criticized this painter, calling him "the Michelangelo of landscape painting." Turner's paintings, on the one hand, stand on the basis of realism, emphasizing subjective impressions, and at the same time exaggerate the form of landscape painting, intending to give a strong and powerful feeling.</p>
<p>If we examine Turner's landscape paintings from a realistic perspective, we can note the following characteristics.</p>
<p>1.  Turner was the first representative writer to depict trains. The train, produced by mechanical civilization, and the natural sentiment of landscape painting are completely different in character; and there are few who dare to use this as the theme of landscape painting later.</p>
<p>2.  Turner rarely uses the simple nature itself as his work, but his sketches depict nature quite a lot.</p>
<p>3.  It is said that Turner once advocated that painters should paint "impressions" and pay special attention to painting the effects of the sun. Comparing this with the reality that the representative writer of the later Impressionist school, Monet, finally created a painting style based on color tone, is quite intriguing.</p>
<p>Regarding the theme and technique of landscape painting, Turner has a strong romantic tendency. Conversely, Constable was a thorough realist among the painters of the early nineteenth century. After several years of groping in the dark, he began to publicly present landscape paintings in 1802. Soon, he felt the weakness of British landscape painters, so he opposed the tradition of most painters blindly following the seventeenth-century Dutch painters and not paying attention to nature; thus, regardless of the needs of general society, he created landscape paintings that faithfully sold to nature. This landscape painting did not seem to gain much praise in Britain, but it gave strong stimulation and good influence to young French painters. In 1824, Constable published three landscape paintings at the Salon in Paris, all of which were works depicting a plain natural environment. He therefore won a gold medal, but its actual effect was even greater. The greatest painter of the nineteenth century, Delacroix, also produced "The Massacre at Chios" at this time. But after seeing Constable's painting, he was quite moved. He immediately took back his own work that had been moved into the venue and revised it before republishing it. This year's Salon was truly an epoch-making period in the French art world. At the same time, Constable's landscape painting became a major reason for the rise of painting in France. Constable's works used lively brushstrokes to depict the posture of nature, giving new life to pastoral landscape painting. He criticized the general ills of the art world, "only looking at old and unglazed screens, and not observing fresh green fields and sunlight." Therefore, his works often contain rich realism in skillful techniques.</p>
<p>Bonington was a short-lived writer. He had superhuman sensitivity. In his short life, he lived in France for most of his time, so he mostly interacted with the predecessors of French landscape painters and also engaged in the guidance of young painters. He also won a gold medal at the Salon in 1824. He seems to be a writer who connects Britain and France with landscape paintings.</p>
<p>In short, the nineteenth century was an era in which landscape painting was particularly developed with France as the center, while Britain rose before France. Therefore, the historical position of British landscape painters in the early nineteenth century was in the two-century period connecting the Netherlands and France.</p>
<h3>Old Wu Zhihui Talks About "Ghost Pushing the Millstone"</h3>
<p>— Guan Zhou</p>
<p>"Ghost" means return. All life becomes a ghost after it ends, meaning it has a destination. Therefore, some say: when a person fights a ghost and wins, the person is still a person, and the ghost will become a ghost among ghosts; if the person loses, they will be equal to the ghost, and there is no loss. Therefore, there is really nothing to fear from ghosts.</p>
<p>Articles about the existence or non-existence of ghosts can often be seen in newspapers and magazines. Whether there are ghosts or not, I am afraid even the authors themselves are not clear. In the whole world, there are more people who fear ghosts and fewer people who do not. Westerners believe in Jesus and fear demons, and Chinese people fear even more ghosts, such as ghosts of those who were hanged, beheaded, burned to death, etc. I think even those who believe in the non-existence of ghosts would have their hair stand on end if they were to walk alone in a graveyard late at night! Therefore, Mr. Wu Zhihui, regardless of the existence of ghosts, since there is the word "ghost," it would not hurt to chat about it after tea and wine.</p>
<p>On May 6, 1944, in a letter to Mr. Wei Juxian to decline his eightieth birthday celebration the following year, he briefly said that he himself was bought from the underworld by his great-grandmother and grandfather. At the time of purchase, he was said to have been put into his mother's belly with a weighing hook and born. To this day, he does not dare to remove the dirt from his navel when bathing, because it is something that seals a hole. If he removes it, his stomach will hurt endlessly, and this has been proven by testing. Furthermore, birthdays should not be celebrated, otherwise the King of Hell will know, and his life will be at stake, etc. The old gentleman is good at joking. Seeing the world as it is now, with people and ghosts being almost the same, he often talks about "ghosts."</p>
<h3>Willow Embankment</h3>
<p>— Ke Ren</p>
<p>This is a straight and less winding embankment, built up from sand and mud, and covered with lush willow trees. The willow forest extends until the edge of the village's surrounding walls, like a natural barrier, and the village is hidden in the dense shade.</p>
<p>At the foot of the embankment is a sandy river. In winter, the river's center freezes over, like a white ribbon winding downstream, and stones of various shapes and sizes are exposed on both sides, half embedded in the frozen mud and sand, and half shining in the sunlight. The mountain valleys upstream accumulate frost and snow for a winter, which flows together with the continuous rain of late spring, and the sandy river begins to flood. The riverbed is filled with yellow, churning muddy waves, constantly impacting and eroding the embankment. We are grateful to the first person who planted seedlings on the sandy shore, because of him, the sandy river flows straight downstream, and this piece of land also appears full of spring.</p>
<p>Ninety-nine percent of the villagers are farmers: from birth to death, almost all of their time is spent in a small circle of several miles around. They rarely come into contact with the vast world outside. Only the willow forest on the embankment is the most familiar to them, and the embankment willows are also the most familiar with them. The embankment willows know the history of the village for decades and all the household trivialities, and secretly calculate: whose son can already climb the tree and blow willow whistles, and whose daughter is preparing her dowry.</p>
<p>Sandy rivers, embankments, and willow forests—these ordinary scenes are common to thousands of remote mountain villages in the north. When I walk through this section of the embankment willow forest, I feel a sense of intimacy welling up in my heart, like returning to my hometown, like seeing my mother. I unconsciously stare at a weeping willow, and suddenly remember many childhood stories from a long time ago.</p>
<h3>The Cradle of Art: The Aesthetic Ancient Greek Society</h3>
<p>— Zhou Gui</p>
<p>Ancient Greek art is now two thousand several hundred years old. However, when modern people see their sculptures, they cannot help but exclaim and praise them. We further believe that truly valuable works of art are timeless. She can transcendently and uniquely maintain her "beauty," not diminishing her color because of all the changes in society. She is forever accepting people's praise. Oh, how great and glorious art is!</p>
<p>The nurturing and growth of ancient Greek art had its own superior conditions. We may as well explore it: First, from a geographical perspective, Athens, the center of ancient Greek art, is mountainous, bordering the sea on the southeast, west, and south sides. In addition, for at least eight months of the year, the climate is very warm, and one can almost go without clothes. People had freedom of thought, loved sports, and their bodies were healthy and beautiful, which should be expected. Therefore, in this environment, climate, and the harmony of the people, it really seems like being in heaven. Having had these superior conditions, coupled with the Greek love of art, it was of course very likely to produce perfect works of art. But there is also a most surprising fact, which is that the ancient Greeks placed an importance on "human beauty" that surpassed everything. Every ancient Greek believed that "human beauty" was above law, morality, chastity, justice, and everything else. Under this belief in pursuing "beauty," the progress and achievement of art naturally created immortal merit. Below are two stories that can prove the environment in which the Greek people lived at the time and their feelings about "beauty."</p>
<p>It is said that in ancient Greece, there was a beautiful woman named Phryne. She twice participated in the Olympic Games, appearing fully nude for people to admire her "human beauty." This was a very honorable thing in ancient Greece. Once, she did not know what law she had broken and was accused. When she was on trial, her defense lawyer did not speak, but simply took off all her clothes, displaying her healthy and beautiful physique. The judge had no way to judge and declared her innocent. In Greek sculpture, there are two female statues, one called La Venus Decnide and one called Venus de Anadyomene (attached image), both of which were sculpted by the sculptor Praxiteles using Phryne as a model.</p>
<p>There was also a beautiful woman named Aspasia, who was also the top beauty of the time. One day, people discovered that she was pregnant, and everyone was worried about her "human beauty." The High Court of Athens ordered her to have an abortion, because they valued "human beauty" more than the child's life!</p>
<p>The factors for the achievement of ancient Greek art, the talent and efforts of artists, are of course necessary, but in society, law, politics, etc., and a favorable environment, are also indispensable. Today's China is still in famine and war. I hope that tomorrow, from the faint dawn of "democracy"—a product of Greece—we will gradually build a peaceful society, so that artists can beautify everything and create an immortal and glorious history. I respectfully and eagerly look forward to it, look forward to it!</p>
<h3>Tang Zuishi's Seal Carving</h3>
<p>— Ye Qiuyuan</p>
<p>Seal carving is a unique form of national art in our country. All those who are influenced by our national culture will similarly have the ability to appreciate and create in this branch of plastic arts. Therefore, our country's seal carving art also extends to other ethnic groups in East Asia. Among them, the achievements of the Japanese ethnic group in this area are particularly worthy of comparison with our country's seal carving art. Seal carving was not originally unique to our country. The issuance of official documents must have a seal to show credibility, which is a common custom in China and abroad. The British cabinet still has a "Lord Privy Seal," which is clear evidence of this. However, in foreign countries, seal carving has not yet advanced to an art form like ours. It still remains at the stage of craftsman technique, which is also a fact. The reason why it has not evolved into an art form is originally limited by foreign literature. Despite the medieval monks' writing skills to the fullest extent for Western European characters, which resulted in the creation of various fancy fonts, Western European characters themselves do not have the same rich patterns and artistic meaning as Chinese characters. Therefore, seal carving art centered on characters has never had the same development in Western Europe as in our country. This is just like how "calligraphy" in Western Europe has never had the same development as in our country.</p>
<p>The art of seal carving in our country originated in the Zhou and Qin dynasties and flourished in the two Han dynasties. From the Jin and Wei dynasties to the Xuanhe period, it became a trend. However, the revival of modern seal carving art is actually rooted in Wen He of the Ming dynasty. Descending to the Qing dynasty, the Eight Masters of Xiling rose in our Hangzhou, vigorous and simple, directly pursuing the Qin and Han dynasties. Thus, seal carving was once again valued by literati. China's seal carving art reached a new peak again. The remaining charm evolved into the Zhejiang and Anhui schools. The Zhejiang school was led by the Eight Masters of Xiling, while the Anhui school traced its origins to Wen He. When Deng Wanbai came out, he became a family on his own, forming a separate sect in seal carving, and was highly respected for a time. The Zhejiang school is based on the Qin and Han dynasties, advocating simplicity, which is close to a classical aesthetic art. The Anhui school advocates decoration, and its spirit is actually equivalent to the Western European "Rococo"; this seems to be not as high as the Zhejiang school in terms of artistic taste, so after Rang Zhi, seal carving in the Anhui school has almost become extinct. The Zhejiang school, after the Eight Masters, was followed by Bei Yuan and Ku Tie. At the end of the Qing dynasty, the seal carvers in Zhejiang once again formed the Xiling Seal Society, and for a time the situation was said to be prosperous. However, not long after, Ku Tie passed away, and the people in the Xiling Seal Society are now also getting old; has our country's seal carving art once again declined to this point?</p>
<p>Seal carving and calligraphy and painting are one body. Therefore, most seal carving masters are also skilled calligraphers and painters. Bei Yuan and Ku Tie were both famous painters and seal carvers, and the early Eight Masters of Xiling were no different. Therefore, their seal carving can carefully adhere to the rules within transcendence and boldness. Today's seal carvers mostly pride themselves on being bold and unrestrained, but they do not know that boldness and unrestraint also contain rules. Since Ku Tie passed away, today's Zhejiang school seal carving circle in China has only produced two masters: Wang Fuchang and Tang Zuishi. Wang and Tang are both cornerstones of the Xiling Seal Society, and they also served in the Seal Society together. Wang is from Hangzhou, while Tang, as a Hunanese, devoted himself to the revival of the Zhejiang school seal carving art, and his contribution is particularly indelible. Wang's careful adherence to the rules is more than enough, and he seems to lack boldness; while Tang's boldness is more than enough, and he is not inferior to Wang in carefully adhering to the rules. His seal carving is based on Mansheng, so his art can form its own style. Zuishi came to Shanghai from eastern Zhejiang after the war. We met occasionally, and he carved three seals for me. They are vigorous and simple, transcending the past. I use this short article to introduce them.</p>
<h3>Venus de Anadyomene</h3>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>Myth</p>
<h3>Fire Record</h3>
<p>— SS</p>
<p>Human economics are in panic, and the celestial palace is also experiencing a severe shortage of materials. The residences of the gods outside the Lingxiao Palace are all being built simply after the victorious demobilization. As winter ends and the year dwindles, with dry winds and scarce water, the Jade Emperor, in order to maintain the safety of the celestial palace, had long issued a decree to quickly organize a firefighting personnel training class, appointing the fire-prevention veteran Zhurong as the class leader, just in case.</p>
<p>Although Zhurong is a famous general who has been through many fire scenes, he is very muddleheaded in handling affairs. The students recruited into the training class are all people who used to "watch the fire" during the enemy and puppet era (they don't understand firefighting at all). Firstly, the salary is too low, and secondly, it is difficult to find real talent, so they are trained in a perfunctory manner. The situation is only hidden from the Jade Emperor.</p>
<p>During the training process, Zhurong used all his skills and taught them many of the latest firefighting techniques. Until a few days before graduation, Zhurong realized that technical training alone was probably not enough, and psychological and moral training were also very important. So, he gathered everyone for a lecture:</p>
<p>Moral Conscience - Not Interested</p>
<p>"Everyone should know: saving a fire is saving lives, and saving lives requires using each person's conscience and moral cultivation as capital..."</p>
<p>"In order to show our conscience and sincerity, we should sacrifice ourselves in emergencies; and at the same time..."</p>
<p>Zhurong glanced at the students listening to the lecture, and they were all nodding off and dozing off. Realizing something was amiss, he raised his voice and shouted:</p>
<p>"In the future, when fighting fires, in order to test everyone's conscience and morality, a detailed inspection must be carried out before departure and after returning..."</p>
<p>Before he could finish speaking, everyone reacted.</p>
<p>"Objection!"</p>
<p>"We object to this method of despising our personality!"</p>
<p>"Objection... We quit!..."</p>
<p>Zhurong finally succumbed to the uproar helplessly.</p>
<p>Graduation arrived. In order to show the results of the training period, there was, as usual, a performance. Everyone wore helmets and armor, driving new "pumping machines" bought from the United States. Hoses like dragons, ladders high, a grand and imposing scene with all new equipment. The Tianfu citizens crowded outside the South Heaven Gate to watch the spectacle. Many gods and great immortals were also invited from the Daluo Heaven and Fengdu City to observe the ceremony.</p>
<p>The performance was, of course, surprisingly outstanding, and everyone applauded. Because the results were satisfactory, all firefighters from Zhurong down were rewarded by the Jade Emperor, and each received a bit of awarded bounty.</p>
<p>Amidst the praise, only the Ten Kings of Fengdu City remained silent. They knew in their hearts that the firefighters' psychology had been seen through, and the underworld would have more troubles from now on. But the heavenly kingdom and the underworld were far apart, and since it was none of their business, they thanked the host after the cocktail party and returned to hell using earth escape.</p>
<p>The God of Wealth's Residence Burned and Looted</p>
<p>As the lunar new year approached, all the gods gathered in the heavenly palace to wish the Jade Emperor a happy new year. In the evening, the God of Wealth held a grand banquet at his private residence, with singing and dancing, and the sound of pipes and flutes. The scene was unprecedented.</p>
<p>As the banquet ended and joy turned to sorrow, at about Xu time (7-9 PM), the God of Wealth's residence suddenly reported a fire on the third floor.</p>
<p>"I wonder which god left a cigarette butt?..." The God of Wealth panicked and immediately sent a servant to notify Zhurong to lead the fire brigade to extinguish the fire. The servant was a famous Shenxing Taibao (a legendary runner), and in less than a second, he had reached the fire brigade headquarters.</p>
<p>"Fire!" The servant said in a state of panic.</p>
<p>"It's the New Year! Don't mess around!" Zhurong had drunk a few more glasses of whiskey and was already drunk by the stove. The other team members were playing "sand crabs" in piles. Seeing the servant come in, he replied casually.</p>
<p>"It's true! The fire has already burned through the roof!"</p>
<p>"Who are you from?"</p>
<p>"The God of Wealth's residence."</p>
<p>"The God of Wealth's mansion?" One of the team members dropped the card in his hand and pulled the others, saying, "Hey, it's not someone else's house, let's go quickly. This is the first income of the New Year, don't let others get ahead!"</p>
<p>Everyone stood up one after another. Suddenly, another team member said to the servant:</p>
<p>"Friend! We're out of gas in the truck!"</p>
<p>"On the first day of the new year, people are having a happy New Year, but we have to work hard at the fire scene!"</p>
<p>Another echoed.</p>
<p>"Okay, everyone, don't nag! We know what we're doing, we won't let you work in vain!" After the servant finished speaking, he turned back to help with the rescue.</p>
<p>At this time, the fire had spread to the second floor, and smoke was rising from the east and west halls. Although the Jade Emperor had sent many people to help, the manpower was still not enough. The God of Wealth scratched his ears and cheeks anxiously:</p>
<p>"I still have a lot of securities and stocks on the second floor, it's all over now!"</p>
<p>Before he could finish speaking, the fire truck arrived. The God of Wealth hurried to meet them:</p>
<p>"Everyone, please help, hurry!"</p>
<p>"Of course, of course, this is our responsibility!... However, how many safes are upstairs?"</p>
<p>"Many, please rescue them first, the salaries for the Daluo Heaven last December haven't been paid yet, they're all in there!"</p>
<p>"God of Wealth! You're a smart person! We work in this industry, living off the fire! The salary is usually low, and today is the New Year!"</p>
<p>"I understand, I understand!... " The God of Wealth held up both hands: "Ten, ten, okay?"</p>
<p>"Ten?... With your status?" Everyone sneered in unison.</p>
<p>"You guys go have a drink first! Let me negotiate with him and then talk!"</p>
<p>With a bang, everyone dispersed, some went to drink, some brought axes and just drilled upstairs. In the firelight, shadows flickered up and down the building, as if they were moving something. The God of Wealth and his family were so anxious that they shed tears.</p>
<p>Don't know when, the negotiations were done, several people connected the tap water, the hose began to spray water, but the fire did not decrease, the God of Wealth family was watered all over, like a water target.</p>
<p>After burning for a full nine hours, the firelight shrank in the sunlight. The God of Wealth's residence was only an empty shell left, and faint knife and axe marks remained on many charred woods.</p>
<p>When the heavenly palace returned to its usual tranquility, the God of Wealth hired many people to rummage through the ashes. Except for a little charred gold foil and gold filings, there was nothing left. Finally, he found a torn piece of paper on the square, which read:</p>
<p>"Report the police early, lose less! Report the police late, burned clean!"</p>
<p>"Damn it! Can I still be considered late for reporting the police?" The God of Wealth stroked the golden robe on his body that had been yellowed by smoke and almost fainted.</p>
<p>After the fact, the morality and conscience of the fire brigade that had been trained had been proven by fact, and Zhurong was finally dismissed by the Jade Emperor.</p>
<h3>Small Statistics</h3>
<p>— Xiaoyun</p>
<p>Not long ago, the second meeting of the Municipal Council, when it was temporarily adjourned due to the difficulty in resolving the municipal government's budget issues, during the short agenda from January 6th to 14th, petitions occurred almost every day, totaling twenty cases. They are listed by day as follows:</p>
<p>The first day (6th): Four cases including students of the Municipal Art Normal School, two business associations of wine and food and coffee, and stall vendors outside the Xincheng fair.</p>
<p>The second day (7th): Two cases including municipal school teachers and stall vendors in the Xincheng district fair.</p>
<p>The third day (8th): One case of Chinese staff of the Power Company.</p>
<p>The fifth day (10th): Four cases including stall vendors in the Lao Zha and Huangpu districts, students of the Municipal Opera School, the Travel Business Association, and workers of the Wing On Textile Factory.</p>
<p>The sixth day (11th): Three cases including stall vendors on Yangzhou Road, the Chinese and Western wine, food and coffee industry, the Shiyan Civil School, and the Municipal Civil School.</p>
<p>The seventh day (12th): Four cases including residents of Huashan Road, students of Shiyan Civil School, residents of enemy and puppet houses in Shanghai, and unemployed workers who came to Shanghai from the rear.</p>
<p>The eighth day (13th): Two cases including the Hotel and Restaurant Association and residents whose land in Wusong was requisitioned by the Central Shipbuilding Factory.</p>
<h3>Coal-Made Butter</h3>
<p>— Cheng Cong</p>
<p>The method of using coal to make butter in wartime Germany was discovered by the reporter in a factory in Wieden City, Germany. First, coal is refined into coke, and the coke produces coal gas. The coal gas is turned into paraffin wax, and the fatty oxygen is extracted from the paraffin wax, added with water, salt, and carrot juice, and then some things are added to make the flavor the same as butter. When this coal-made butter is first produced from the machine, it looks like a long yellow sausage, eight inches in diameter. A British military attache tasted it and reportedly could not tell the difference between coal-made butter and real butter. The factory is now planning to resume butter production.</p>
<h3>Natural Philosophy</h3>
<p>— Whiskey</p>
<p>Whip</p>
<p>A philosopher once said:</p>
<p>"Don't think the whip is hateful, please pay attention to the hand that holds the whip!"</p>
<p>Although he fills you high, he grinds himself lower and lower. When it greatly affects your height, he is no longer in one piece.</p>
<p>These young men, how simple they are! Very unified. Thousands upon thousands, all the same, obediently waiting in line, waiting to serve me. No problem at all.</p>
<p>When I pull one out of them to serve me, even if his head is broken and completely destroyed, he is still happy.</p>
<p>I don't know how many of these young men have been destroyed in my fragrant pipe.</p>
<p>"When it shines, everything is over!"</p>
<p>Wind Instrument</p>
<p>This is because he has a charming voice; otherwise, his body full of holes would be very glaring.</p>
<h3>A Decree of Fate</h3>
<p>— Sui</p>
<p>Calamity originated on the first day of the first lunar month of the Dinghai year, at 9 PM.</p>
<p>Dinghai (Year)</p>
<p>Renyin (Month)</p>
<p>Xin Chou (Day)</p>
<p>Bingxu (Hour)</p>
<p>Observing the right structure: the year and hour clash, Bing and Ding transform into fire, the heavenly path travels south, indicating a major fire disaster. Gan is in Ren, Ren can transform into water and save the great disaster, but the daily branch is Chou, Chou is the image of a small clown, indicating that there will be small clowns jumping on the beams, and "Xin" is extremely spicy, difficult to satisfy greed. The "Yin" day is like a tiger, like a tiger with wings, turning over boxes and cabinets, splitting trees and breaking bamboo. "Xin" contains gold, fearing the loss of a large batch of gold bars. At this time, Ren water is of no help, the fire will inevitably spread, and the pockets of the crowd of clowns will inevitably be filled. Xu and Hai pig, two constellations in a chain, pigs and dogs colluding together, proving that there is more than one looter; according to the hexagram imagery, in the chaos, pigs and dogs running around, probably every item has been smelled and chewed by them.</p>
