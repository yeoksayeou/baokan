<h3>東北戰局已趨穩定國軍兩路迫公主嶺　昌圖收復四平共軍西移</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽廿四日電〕東北戰局，因國軍之出擊及堅守四平結果，危機雖仍存在，但確已趨穩定，首由本溪收復，減少灌陽緊張，繼之爲長春與鐵嶺，開原南北國軍雙方前進夾擊，影響頗大，尤以南路擁有大批生力軍繞越昌圖，兼程北上爲甚，共軍已抽撤四平圍軍一部分向南北襲擊，四平廿三日夜僅有部份接觸，廿四日晨九時，圍攻四平共軍主力已向八面城移動。又據空軍偵察，鐵路西側北部，尙有二三據點有國軍固守。按共軍對四平之圍攻，迄今已十四日，陳明仁及劉翰東率軍政人員以成功成仁精神苦守，加以空軍有力協助，造成共軍不得轉兵長春·瀋陽之戰果，一般人大表崇敬，惟共軍及人民死亡慘烈，又四平亦成一瓦礫場，亦使人心碎。遼南國軍正作肅淸收復據點外圍工作，營口港外已來軍艦一艘，將續有軍艦到達，頗使東北人民快慰。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿四日電〕瀋陽電稱：四平街守軍在巷戰中殲減共軍三千，奪獲步槍一千枝，輕重機槍五百架，中共電台廣播，對此項消息不予軍視，連日仍自稱在四平街迭獲勝利。廿二夜間，戰事最爲激烈，市內一片火光，政府飛機甚爲活動，在一書夜中出發轟炸達一百三十次之多，同時運輸機則以大量接濟品投與四平街及長春·吉林守軍。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春廿四日電〕開原以北國軍，向公主嶺急進，北路國軍廿二日已到達陶家屯（公主嶺北），該兩路國軍已對公主嶺作鉗形攻勢。</p>
<p>〔中央社潘陽廿四日電〕瀋陽營口綫上已無共軍，中長客車定廿五日南通至外石橋及營口，北通至開原。北上應援四平國軍，廿四日下午收復昌圖。南下部隊已進抵公主嶺近郊。</p>
<p>〔中央社吉林廿四日電〕吉瀋綫西陽至雙河鎭間鐵路，業經修復，今可試車。</p>
<p>〔本報潘陽廿四日電〕朝陽方面共軍雖已圍城，陷於緊張，據軍方表示可無虞。</p>
<p>〔中央社承德廿四日電〕由赤峯南下共軍，襲擊凌源·葉柏壽後，另部約三千餘，廿二日晚復犯朝陽，激戰終夜，廿三日晨車站（城北三里）已被攻陷，守軍退守城區及城南山山頭陣地，刻戰鬥仍在繼續中。</p>
<h3>憲政促進會聯席會中　陳總長報告軍事　目前情形較「五三」尤有過之</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕國防部參謀總長陳誠，廿四日上午九時在憲政實施促進會聯席會中報吿最近各戰塲軍事情况，其結論稱；目前如軍令，政令配合適宜，軍事結束決可提早，渠檢討共軍必敗之事實有三：（一）共軍已爲一般人民所痛恨，亦可謂已離開靈衆，是則必敗。（二）共軍軍心已墨動搖，投誠者達十三萬餘人一點，可足證明。（三）物資困難，故共軍決不能支持長久，且終必失敗。陳氏於答覆各委員詢問時並稱：目前之戰爭，實已進至國際戰爭階段，尤以東北戰場，新疆事件，使人深感有陷於民國十七年「五三」慘案覆轍之危，且有過之無不及。惟「五三」濟南慘案未能阻止北伐之進行，現吾人信心彌堅，當亦能克服一切困難。</p>
<p>陳氏就一般情勢申述稱：自前年八月抗戰勝利後，政府一本和平政策，以謀取中共問題之解決，惟共軍乘機一面擴充地盤，一面發展軍力，東北局部地區，乃落入共軍之手。抗戰前共軍兵力約共三個師，抗戰期中至卅一年止，曾要求編爲九個師，抗戰結束，則要求編爲十八個師，卅四年十月毛澤東至渝，又要求編爲四十八個師，由此即可證明其軍力在不斷擴展中。至去年已擴充至八十五萬人，在軍力上，政府方面頗感危險，此時期中吃虧頗大，去年七月後，政府始予以反擊，將蘇北宿遷共軍驅至隴海路以北，且續克張家口·四平街·長春，今年中共拒絕和談後，政府乃被迫爭取主動行動，此一階段，可稱共軍之生死關頭，共軍乃趁莫斯科會議機會，下令「一切爲軍事一切爲勝利」。在此半年中，我打勝共軍五次，而今共軍乃向我作第二次大規模之進擊，共軍於五次失敗之後，竟迅速恢復力量，向我反擊，此全賴國際力量，實可注意。此次東北戰事中，共軍中確有蘇軍及韓共，日俘參加作戰，至今我仍居被動地位。</p>
<p>陝北方面，我雖佔領其老巢延安，然流竄陝，甘邊區之共軍，尙未肅淸。</p>
<p>山東方面，自去年將蘇北共軍驅至隴海路以北後，本年二月我進而將臨沂至蘭封一帶完全佔領，惟因交通工具不够，運輸困難，故進展尙未如理想。第七十四師不幸壯烈犧牲，迄今未將能山東共軍全部解決，實在於交通困難，目前已進行修路，俾利軍運</p>
<p>津浦路北段天津以南各據點，國軍增援中，共軍在津浦路北段作戰目的，在乎策應東北戰事。河南方面共軍劉伯誠部隊，已無力量再行進攻。至山西戰事，國軍自在晋南增援後，戰局已趨穩定，太原方面一度緊張，目前相信已無問題。</p>
<p>最後陳氏稱；各地戰事雖頗緊張，然勝利之必屬於我，當可相信。</p>
<p>繼陳總長報吿後，有國防部第二廳代廳長侯騰及第三應第二處處長李樹正分別報吿各戰塲軍力情勢等，略稱：關內共軍主力八十餘萬人，其中有訓練者六十萬人，地方部隊廿萬人。在東北者五十二萬人，計中共廿九萬，韓共十萬，日俘十萬，東蒙自治軍二萬，蘇聯顧間四十二人（在吉北之缸溝有卅一人，在四平街東之赫爾德有十一人）山東共軍廿萬人，由葉劍英指揮，有蘇軍船隻代爲輸送士兵，且利用聯總救濟船隻以運彈藥。平漢·津浦北段戰事，在圖擾亂我平津治安，以阻止我增援東北。東北共軍有向熱河·冀東作破壞交通之企圖，晋南共軍三萬餘，由陳毅指揮，晋北三萬餘，由賀龍指揮，陝北五萬人，由彭德懷指揮，目前國內較大戰塲，爲東北·山東·陝北三處，東北方面四平街正　戰中，中長路以東在國軍之手，以西則由共軍盤據，國軍現正由長春·瀋陽南北夾擊，共軍實力已大减。山東無大戰，聞膠濟路南將開始決定性大戰。陝北國軍自克復延安後，共軍主力已吿不支，國軍仍在追擊中，亦可能有一決定性之戰事發生，如西路獲勝，共軍自易解決。關於北塔山事件，因有蘇聯標誌之飛機掩護外蒙軍入侵，已決非普通邊疆糾紛，我軍於戰鬥中曾獲有甚多勛草·文件，並已擊落該項飛機一架，刻正作縝密研究。</p>
<p>李並叙述一年來作戰感想稱：東北不能統一，旅大不能順利接收，明眼人當不難明瞭其中之徵妙因素，軍人有誓守疆土之決心，同時，尙須與外交，政治兩方面配合。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕參謀總長陳誠，廿四日下午四時許邀晤美軍事顧問團長魯克斯，有所商談。</p>
<h3>國軍進駐唐官屯　津鹽公路方面繼續推進保定外圍共軍夜襲未逞</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕軍方發表：津浦北段國軍部署完畢，開始南下後，廿三日午後收復陳官屯，廿四日晨六時續收復唐官屯，該方共軍有西竄模樣。</p>
<p>〔中央社天津廿四日電〕津鹽公路方面，國軍已確實佔領馬廠，减河兩岸之朝宗橋，惠豁橋，配合正面國軍推進。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕北寗綫古冶附近，昨夜有激戰，鐵路有破壞，唐山以東電綫全被破壞，故詳情不明。平津段楊村北倉間，昨夜被破壞五處，午前修復通車。</p>
<p>〔中央社保定廿四日電〕保垣外圍南北大冉一帶，連夜遭共軍襲擊，因國軍防守森嚴，終未使得逞。廿三日夜一時許，共軍復集結七十九師淸苑大隊等部千餘人，向保定西南北溝頭進犯，並以迫擊砲，機槍等重火器猛攻，至拂曉前仍爲國軍擊潰，向原路退去。</p>
<h3>董彥平上官雲相昨離平分返瀋津</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕華北·東北軍事聯繫協商事舉，董彥平·上官雲相廿四日分返潘·津。董彥平臨行稱：國軍決不放棄東北，刻各路援軍在繼續增加中，所有已失各大據點，即可逐漸收回。</p>
<p>〔中央社天津廿四日電〕保定綏署副主任上官雲相，廿四日下午五時四十分專車返抵津。</p>
<h3>蒙疆邊界已經劃定　北塔山事件非疆界糾紛政府某首長對記者宣稱</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿四日電〕據此間政府某負責首長向中央社記者表示，對外間誤傳外蒙入侵新疆事件起因於外蒙與新疆疆界糾紛一節，嚴予駁斥。該負責人稱，中國根據民族自決原則重視外蒙人民意志，承認其獨立政府，自無翻悔之理，惟外蒙原爲我國特別行政區，隸屬中國版圖，根據中央法規，除中央政府外，地方無權勘定各行政單位之疆界，而根據中蘇條約，其獨立後之疆界應以原有之疆界爲疆界，則法律上其疆界自僅能就中國政府前所釐定者爲進　（詳見內政部地圖），故所謂北塔山事件，導源於疆界糾紛之說，其爲歪曲事實，至爲顯然。</p>
<h3>旅大視察報告短期內可公布</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕旅大視察團向外部所提報吿書，短期內可望公布，惟日期未定。</p>
<h3>憲政會四委會舉行聯席會議</h3>

<h3>司徒雷登華誔</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕美駐華大使司徒雷登，今日欣逢七十一華誕，各國使節，我方首長及各界人士，紛往祝籌。大使官邸內佈置古色古香，來賀仕女雖多西洋氣息，然鉅幅「尋」字及王母娘娘戲　之書軸與籌桃，壽糕，配以紅燭高燒，實充滿東方情調。司使着白色西服，以極愉悅慈祥之神色，迎送賀客。此種情形，宛如七十年前西子湖畔大使誕生時之東西合璧家庭然。蔣主席夫婦於晚八時在官邸壽宴司使，燕大旅京校友則於四時舉行慶祝茶會。司使今日曾收到張羣院長一精美之象牙雕刻品與張厲生部長之古瓷花瓶。此類珍品均爲司使最喜愛之裝飾。</p>
<h3>改革幣制問題正蒐集材料中</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕張院長所提之經濟改革方案，全國經委會廿六日開第五次會時將予研討。關於幣制改革問題，該會推定俞鴻鈞，張嘉璈研究，並蒐集材料中。</p>
<h3>林蔚黃鎮球　對調命令即可發表</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕國防部次長林蔚，將與參謀次長黃鎭球對調，明令即可發表。黃原任援勤總司令，上月底與郭懺對調，改任謀次長，現又調任國防部次長。</p>
<h3>蔣經國飛京</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕蔣經國廿國日上午離平飛京。</p>
<h3>孫科談中日關係　主張早日簽訂對日和約</h3>
<p>〔合衆社甫京廿三日電〕孫科副主席頃發表談話稱：中國應準備早日與日本簽訂和約，以保證日本永不再成爲侵略國及協力促進東方永久和平與穩定爲基礎。以言中日將來之關係，就余個人之意見而論，中國應不咎日本之旣往，勿存報復之心，應與美英及其他盟，協助日本恢復其在國際間之正當地位。亞洲今日之最大危機，厥爲共黨破壞經濟復興之企圖，日本應成爲遏阻赤色極權擴張之屏藩之一，此非不應懲罰日本過去罪行，而使日本軍國主義有機可乘死灰復燃之謂，實係促使日本自　前愆，以行動表現其國際和平合作這意向耳。中國應準備與日本完全恢復商務關係，倘屬可能，在簽訂和約前亦不妨爲之，蓋各國皆需要其他國家所能供應之貨物故也。但對目前日本改革之動態，亦不應過於信任，世人應知日本軍國主義之蠻橫有悠久之史實，故必需縝密加以防範，澈底加以剷除。總之，麥克阿瑟將軍今已履行其統制日本之優良工作，其堅定之毅力，根絕日本軍國主義與超國家一主養，使日本人民受基督教義之感化，實已爲各勝刦國家樹一楷模。</p>
<h3>對日貿易政策我應着重輸出　唐商務專員所獲結論</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿三日電〕日本與本年八月十五日恢復私人國際賢易後，中國對亟需物資之日本的貿易政策，應着重出口，而非入口，是爲中國代表團商稅專員中國，日本以及盟總之觀迎，日本極端缺乏原料，中國能作相當程度之供應，着重輸出之貿易政策，一方可使中國增加輸出，一方又可加速日本工業及經濟之恢復。日本在經濟方面之進展，又可减低盟軍佔領日本之費用。</p>
<h3>調整台幣匯率　中央已授權魏主席</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北廿四日電〕外傳合省府已與中央取得諒解，可自由調整台幣與法幣匯率，財政廳長嚴家淦今已間接予以證實，據稱：台胞多望台幣價値提高，藉以隔離外來金融彼動，現中央對調整台幣匯率，確已授予魏主席較大權限。</p>
<h3>軍職人員加薪自五月起補發</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕軍職人員加薪，前經政院決定，但迄未實行，頃悉：此項加薪辦法，已重行決定，軍官不分將·校·尉級，一律增加百分之四十，士兵至少增加一倍以上，短期內即可正式公布實行，並自本年五月份起補發。</p>
<h3>民社國外黨員關心黨內糾紛　電請伍憲子繼續調停</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕伍憲子昨晤記者稱：頃得紐約來電，美洲之民社黨員，於本月十九，廿兩日在紐約召開非正式會議，決定請伍氏縱續調停民社黨內爭，並聲明四點立塲：（一）上次議黨組委會不足法定人數，應重開一次。（二）海外代春廿六人之派代表出席，就予承認。（三）孫寶剛等攻擊黨主席，並不過罪，不應開除，但革新委員會亦應停上活動。（四）候糾紛兩方恢復感情後，再行召開全體代表大會。伍氏並表示：此項電文即日送交張君　，如張氏同意，即開始調停。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕徐傅霖廿四日夜車離京赴滬，定七六日赴粵，主持民社黨粵省黨部成立典禮。徐目前仍自兼粵省黨部立委，徐定事畢後於七月四日前返京。</p>
<h3>中法民航協定延長　法方換文已送達　我並向加借欵建設航空</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕中法民航協定延長至本年年底一事，法方渙交文憶到達，下次政務會議中，可望提出，並通過換文，要點有二：（一）延長六個月至本年年底為止，（二）以前兩國習機飛抵目的後即須轉返原地，現可不受此限制。法機自河內飛抵上海後，可飛至日本，香港或其他不屬中國之地點。我機飛抵河內後，亦可飛往印度，歐洲等地。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕民航載安國，現正與加拿大政府進行新借款談判，俾使加政府供給我物資，助我從事航空及交通建設。</p>
<h3>防止普選發生舞弊內部擬定制裁辦法</h3>

<h3>中美正式談判戰債　新貨款正探討中　顧大使在華府發表談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿三日電〕中美兩國對解決戰時賬目廿一美元之談判，已於本日正式在此舉行。我國代表團在駐美大使顧維鈞領導之下，與美助理國務卿索爾浦領導下之美代表國舉行國務院官員所稱「探討性質」之會議。國務院發言人稱，會商將在數日內進入「工作境界」，並謂：中國之戰時賬目，包括戰時及戰後交移中國之租借物資十五億六千四百六十九萬八千美元，一九四二年五億美元借款，未結算之戰時剩餘財產（作價後歸入信用貸款項下），總値三千五百萬美元及兩國間其他財政上債務。上述三千五百萬美元剩餘財產之交易，包括移交中國之下列名項：（一）美方在滬所建之船塢，（二）對日戰爭勝利後堆積印度加爾各答之大批卡車（價値二千五百萬美元）及（三）華西美陸軍之戰時剩餘物資。以上各項在去年八月卅日所訂之剩餘出售協定中，均未解決。此項雙方談判，並將對去年八月售予中國價値九億美元之剩餘物資項下價値五億美元剩餘物資之賬目，重新作一估價。國務院上月宣布將開始談判時，曾表示與中國談判之租借協定之條件。將反映美國與其他各國（尤以英國爲著）所訂協定之「同樣寬大之解決原則」。英國之租借賬目，經除去美國所負彼之反租借賬目，及其他債務後，共計約二百五十億美元。解決之結果，約爲每一美元，僅須償付約美金二角五分。參加談判之我代表儷團員，有大使館譯紹華公使及我駐美購料代表團團長王景春，美方代表國員爲國務院財政及開發政策司司長奈士，及中國司司畏林華德。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿三日電〕中國駐美大使顧維鈞廿三日談稱：中國可能向美國取得一筆新大宗借款，作爲中國戰後建設之甩。此係顧大使會晤美助理國務卿桑浦後所發表之談話，並謂：此項新惜款現尙在探討階段，借款數目亦未提及。此借款將爲短期性，數目當較一次所貸予之長期借款爲小。顧氏希望能獲得一龐大之長期借款，渠發覺桑浦對此事甚表同情。顧氏與桑浦會晤之主要部份，乃關於中國償還租借法案借款問題。渠訪問桑浦主要目的，殆在使　浦明瞭中國之情形。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據美國國外淸理委員會昨日宣布：很據去年八月三十日之中美剩餘物資協定，至上月三十一日爲止，已將價値約一億七千萬美元之物資移交中國。其中包括卡車，開路機器，衣糾，食物，藥品等，惟飛機作戰物資船隻及海軍裝備則不在移交之列。此批物資之所在地，一部份在中國本土，此外在關島，琉球及太平洋各島上。當去秋中美成立協定時，佔計約有五億美元之剩餘物資移交中國。協定簽字後，中國行政院物資供應局及美國國外淸理委員會即開始如何履行契約之談判，當時即設立機構派定人員，移交工作隨即開始。六個月之後，美方即移交三千萬美元之物資，今年三，四，五月內，又移交約一萬三千六百萬美元之物資，即每月移交物資四千五百萬美元。</p>

<h3>沃文晋謁主席當晚乘車返滬</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿四日電〕聯合國副秘長沃文，廿四日抵京訪問我政府首長，並晋竭蔣主席。沃氏係於今晨七日抵京，十時由外部體賓司長凌其翰及國府秘書沈昌煥陪同晋見主席，談約十五分　，沃氏除向主席致敬外，並代表聯合國秘書處就遠東經委會開會期間，我外交當局及滬市府之協助，表示感謝。旋即辭出，赴陵園謁陵獻花，午應王部長世杰歡宴，午後沃氏復由凌司長陪同邦會張院長羣，並出席英大使館歡迎茶會及運羅國慶酒會，晚應聯合國中國同志會理事長朱家驊氏之歡宴，當晚即返滬。</p>
<p>滬市參議會等十四國體，昨舉行鷄尾酒會，歡迎遠東經濟委會各國代表，圖示潘議長公展（右）與印度代表奈　握手寒喧情形（本報攝）</p>
<h3>對遠東經委會任務　潘公展發表意見　經濟與政治應相提並論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市參議會·市商會·地協會·全國商聯會·市工業協會·銀行公會·錢業公會·輪船業公會·進出口商公會·六區棉紡業公會·四區麪粉榮公會·中國工商協會·國民外交協會·中國國際貿易協會等十四單位，爲歡迎此次來滬出度聯合國亞洲曁遠東經濟委員會會議之各國代表，特於昨日下午六至八時，在國際飯店十四樓舉行鷄尾酒會招待。由潘議長公展·顏惠慶·王曉籟·王正廷·徐寄廣·吳蘊初·唐星海·李道南·厲樹雄等十餘人主持，到吳市長·李石曾·曁各國代表，各界首長及其他來賓等約三百餘人。</p>
<p>記者乘便叩詢潘議長，對於此次會議之意見，潘議長略謂：第二次世界大戰以後，國際性會議在本市舉行的，此係首次，戰爭期間，亞洲及遠東所受戰事損失，慘烈程度，並不亞於歐洲或其他各部，而尤以中國所受敵人之蹂躪最深而最久。本市則在遠東大戰開始時即首遭破壞，南市，閘北，江灣，吳淞一帶戰禍之遺跡，現尙歷歷在目，以聯合國亞洲曁遠東經濟委員會的任務言。其最終目的，固在帮助亞洲及遠東各國經濟之重建與創造更高之經濟活動水準，深信各國代表將必覺察其本身使命之重大，與人們期待之迫切。在政治與經濟分不開的今日，政治之安定，往往有賴於經濟問題之解決，而經濟之穩定，亦有待於政治的開明與進步，吾人深望目光遠大之各國代表，不以解決經濟範圍內的問題爲已足，更能盡力促使全世界各民族間政治上的眞誠合作，彼此毫無猜疑，然後可以從經濟復與中，求得人羣生活之安定。至在遠東方面，日本原是一個高度工業化的國家，其廉價貨品之傾銷，甚至可以遠及歐美，然在戰時，日本工業設備，反並未遭到嚴重破壞，假若盟國不對日本加以合理管制，或甚至受日本柔順僞裝的欺騙，而太過信任，使管制工作流於放縱，則將使亞洲及遠東其他各國的經濟復興，感到困難，甚或使世界人類重遭戰禍，故吾人甚望迅速而且優先在日本方而獲得充裕而爲應得之補償，以助中國經濟的復興，同時必須阻遏足以促使日本經濟侵略死灰復燃的一切活動，庶幾此項會議之舉行爲不虛矣。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社西貢廿四日電〕中國駐西貢殷總領事，今日發表聲明，警吿越盟當局勿縱續破壞華僑財產，否則中國政府將重行考慮其目前之中立態度。聲明中稱：法越衝突使越南華僑蒙受重大損失，中國曾數度向法當局提出抗議，越盟人士對華僑企業之種種破壞行動，深可扼腕。查華僑財產係辛勤所得，安南人以此種態度報答中國之友誼，殊不可解。中國在現行衝突中保持友誼的中立，余希望越盟當局設法制止對華僑財產之破壞行動，否則吾政府將被迫重行考慮其態度矣。</p>

<p>〔中央社廣州廿四日電〕粵省水災日趨嚴重，省垣各界人士，頃正盡其一切可能　　募捐款，分發災區散賑。行轅主任張發奎特向海外僑胞廣播，呼籲援救水災難胞。行轅官兵並自動節食一餐及捐一日所得，全市工人亦決定捐獻其一日勞苦收獲，以惠災黎，此間五劇塲今晚作籌款義演，市商會亦分隊出發募款。又香港爲胞其關懷災區難胞之熱情，並不下於此間，籌集之賬款，戲至目前止，已達港幣廿五萬元，昨推代表來此洽商散賑辦法，並在此設賑災聯絡辦事處。</p>

<p>〔本報廣州廿四日電〕珠江水利局長楊華日，頃招待記者，報告粵四江永災，迄今情况略穩，因　雨影響，本年汎期提早一月，各江水位與歷年耙錄比較，計東江超過半公尺，北江僅差一點二公尺，西江差點九七公尺，韓江亦比歷年爲高，致各地隄圍崩潰數十處，估計被淹稻田損失達一〇五市畝，或一五〇萬市担，照市値盯達三千億元，其他財物漂失，更無從估計，水利局現派駐四江工程人員一百二十人，已加緊搶救隄圍，及待水退協助趕築秋欄，以保晚造。淮此次水災發生，似爲三十年大洪水過期，現距大汎期尙有九十餘天，潦水必將踵至，故除該局悉力協助外，尙須地方官民協力巡視搶險，否則災害更難預訂。又此間達日已放晴，浸入市區之潦水已返下二三尺，市外交通亦已逐漸恢復，粵漢廣三等綫已通車，穗市水災想可倖免。</p>

<p>第一，中國人民對於戰後世界的基礎態度，一言以蔽之，乃在希望國際間能够眞正諒解，從諒解求合作，從國際合作求得世界和平。這種的基本態度，與聯合國憲章的精神，可以說完全相符。中國代表出席任何國際會議，無不以此種基本態度爲出發點，對於聯合國機構所企求的理想，更具有信心，戴了有色眼鏡來看中國的外交政策，固然要覺得中國處於世界的兩大之間，有所偏側；但若能平心而論，中國的外交政策，可謂四平八穩，除了忠實履行國際條約的義務而外，並力求與各友邦和平相處，從國際合作中求人類的進步與幸福。卽以對美蘇兩國而論，我國所採取的立塲，也是一視同仁，並無「友」「敵」「親」「疏」之分。因爲中國先天旣然不足，後天又復失調。戰前的中國，受了各帝國主義的政治經濟文化的侵略，早已陷於次殖民地的地位，對外雖然說，中國是以農立國的農業國家，但是全國農民墨守成法，故步自封，以致農村破產，單以糧食一項而論，每年還要仰給外國以洋米麵粉入口，至於工商業，一蹶不振，完全是一個工業落後的國家。迨至抗戰軍興，益感國家的危險，幸賴蔣主席的領導全國，在其「抗戰必勝建國必成」的共同信念之下，在軍事上終於獲得了最後的勝利；但是在經濟上，全國經過八年的摧毀，元氣大傷，幾乎滿目瘡痍，戰後自然需要休養生息，俾能恢復元氣；然後走上建國復興的大道；對外不僅需要國際和平，而且更需要列强在經濟上物質上的援助；唯有在這個條件並存的情况下，中國埋頭建國，始能建設成功一個和平統一民主强大的國家。所以在抗戰勝利之後，中國政府就不惜重大犧性，與蘇聯簽訂友好同盟條約；就是在目前，中國政府對於蘇聯的態度，仍舊非常謹愼小心，終是希望蘇聯能够遵守中蘇同盟條約的精神。最近數星期來，一則因外蒙的侵入我國新疆，另則因東北戰爭的演變爲國際問題，使中蘇關係又有新的醞釀，遠東局勢忽縐緊張，我們不能不奉吿霍華德諸君，這種局勢的演變。應完全由蘇聯負責，只要蘇聯能遵守中蘇友好同盟條約，不僅且前的一切問題，都可以迎刃而解，而且中蘇保持友好合作的關係，並非不可能的。</p>
<p>第二，關於中美兩國的邦交，我們首先希望霍華德諸君，將來能有更多的時間，從容實地觀察中國人民對於美國的觀感，俾能充分哩解中國，眞正認淸遠東。我們終覺得美國的「中國通」，對於中國的認識，往往不免於膚淺，對於任何問題，常常不能觸及其核心，因此其所得的結論，也就不免流於浮囂。例如本埠英文大美晚報，曾發表一篇社論「誰放棄了誰？」誤解中國要美國援助，純出淤自私的動機；又美國合衆社記者侖道爾也報道美國進出口銀行不肯放出早已儲款以待的五億貸款的理由，謂一是中國過去有濫用美國貸款之事實；另是中國現行政策歧視美國在華利　。這兩點，在美國朝野看來，或者認爲言之有理；但是在我們看來，是不必要解釋的歪曲事實，中國亟需美國的經濟援助，是世界大局客觀形勢所形成的，老實說，中國如無必要，決不願向美國開口借款；借款到手之後，更不會恣意揮有出息。至於中國政府歧視美國在華利益，更加不必要解釋，中美商約不是早已簽訂了嗎？商約的精神不是完全基於平等互惠嗎？但是中國是工商業落後的國家，在事實上與美國平等互惠，就是冲國吃虧；何况在美國進出口銀行將儲款以待五億元貸款拒不放出的時候，中國旣缺少美元，美國又不肯相助，試問如何再能與美國互惠，中國政府實行進出口管制，是勢所必立，理所當然的措施。</p>
<p>要之，「誰放棄了誰」？不必再爭論了，我們希望癸國新聞界的鉅子霍華德諸君，能將我國人民的感情與思想，帶回本國去，吿訴全國朝野，拿我們上述兩點，作爲重行考慮對華政策的基礎；美國遠東工商會議主張研究中國現狀，如能前來中國實地考察，尤爲我們所竭誠歡迎。中美邦交素來友好，經過八年來血的洗鍊，益形密切，已成爲患難之交，最近中美間的一層陰影，終不難烟消雲散。惟我們站在同業的立塲仍希望美國新聞界的鉅子，能利用報紙作爲利器，以促進國際關係，兩次世界大戰的敎訓，使我們深切了解，國際戰爭的發生，往往爲若干誤會所引起，防微杜漸，不可不愼；我們希望中美兩國的新聞界，爲促成國際間的諒解與合作，以消除戰爭的原因起見，對淤這一方面，應得特別努力。</p>

<h3>美參院推翻總統否決　勞資法案成法律　今後工會活動將受限制　各地工人擬發動總罷工以示抗議</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿三日電〕經杜　門總統否決之限制工會之活動之勞資法案，已於今日經參議院以六十八票對廿五票，通過維持原案。衆議院已於上星期議決推翻總統之否決，故該一法案巳自動成僞法律。參議院表決時，贊成維持原案者較必要之三分之二大多數猶多六票。總統於表決前特函民主黨領袖巴克萊稱，該案爲危險的立法，並請民主然參議員務必維持其否決。該法授權政府得下令制止全國緊急性之罷工至少八十天，並修正「國家勞工關係法案」中之若干親定，以限制工會之活動。工會領袖稱，該一新法案奴隸法案，全國工會曾紛紛致電議員，請求維持總統之否決。共和黨方面之意見，曾由參議員塔虎脫予以槪述，塔氏謂，共和黨於去年十一月當選時，即受託提出此一立法案，以調整資方與工會間之均勢，總統若能顧及人民意志，而不加入其個人之意見，則誠有功於民衆矣。觀察家相信此一新法案之通過，將使勞資關係導入新時代，其影響當如新政全盛時代通過之華格果法案。預料今後第一階段，必將發生勞資間之爭端及訴訟，以試探此一新法律之效能，正與華格果法案甫經通過後之情形相似。新法之許多條歡，勢須經最高法院予以解釋決定，尤其是關於工會之安全，損害之造成，工會對罷工及遠背契約之責任，以及工會所取之「不公」辦法等，勢必將請法院予以釋明。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓噸四日電〕塔虎脫—哈特萊之工會管制法案今日已引起勞工方面之迅速反應，將號召總罷工以示抗議。工會領袖因總統否決竟被參衆兩院輕易推翻，殊爲憤慨，聲言將在投票時反對擁護此項法案之立法議員，以示報復。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿四日電〕美參院推翻杜魯門總統對勞資法案之否決後，美全國之反響情形有如下述：（一）烟煤礦工預定於星期五午夜與政府所訂立之合同滿期前開始休假者，業已提前停止。亞拉巴麻州，賓夕法尼亞州，西佛吉尼亞及佛吉尼亞州之煤礦皆已停頓。據最後消息，停止工作之礦業工人，超過二萬三千人以上。（二）舊金山之勞組織大會要求該會主席摩雷通告舉行罷工廿四小時，反對該項勞工法。美東南區三萬會負之聯合鋼鐵工會，預料該項勞工法將引起百分之九十有組織工人之總罷工。（三）美國聯合工會之主席格林宣佈，聯合工會將立即進行取消該法律運動，並預測擁護該法案者，在一九四八年之選舉中被擊敗。美國新聞協會之副主席之意見頗不一致，有認爲足以加强該黨在一九四八年中之力量者，亦有認爲削弱者。（五）華萊士之美國進步公民會程，杜魯門未能貫徹其否決權，乃其歷來不能實現故總統羅斯福計劃中之最慘烈之一次。（六）底德律工頭協會之主席基斯，預料法院將對新法律之條文加以試騐，即將工頭剝奪談判之權利。（七）共和黨發言人警吿行政當局防止處理不當，而遭勞工對該法律之破壞，同時全國勞工局之總顧問范那爾克爾，由於該法律之實施可能性，發生嚴重疑問，提出辭職。（八）美國商會長西里夫稱，此項法案爲美國工業史上之奠定基石，有助於工業和平。</p>
<h3>否決勞資案雖被推翻　杜魯門聲望反增　對下屆競賽有何影響尚難斷言</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿三電〕關於杜魯門總統否決共和黨議員塔虎脫及哈特萊所提勞工法案一事，頃據消息靈通人士談稱：總統之否決，雖已被推翻，但其本人聲望則反因此大爲增加。杜警門總統之見解雖然爲一般人士所贊同，但其名舉，則已因其所持立塲而提高，但此對於民主黨在一九四八年競選總統時，並不一定有何裨益。民主黨議員之與共和黨議員採取同一陣綫而反對政府，對於勞工問題所特立塲者，爲數頗衆，政府當局認爲新勞工法案嚴格限制工會活動，將禁止關店制度，亦包括在內，實不足取云。</p>
<h3>莫斯科電台　抨擊美外交政策</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿三日電〕莫斯科電台今夜發出廣播，嚴詞抨擊美國之外交政策，認爲其目的乃欲以「微薄之金元禮物」控制世界。該評論員幷未直接論及馬歇爾之經濟援助歐洲計劃，僅謂美國之新政策即杜發門主義，其目的僅爲表現美國之帝國主義，欲對世界各國施以經濟控制，以界予經濟緩助促進世界和平與安全爲名，實則美帝國主義者乃欲建立與鞏固其政治與經濟之新勢力範閣云。</p>
<h3>英內閣要員會晤克萊頓　討論馬歇爾計劃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿四日廣播：外部長發言人宣稱：艾德禮及各部長週二晨與美副國務卿克萊頓及美駐英大使道格拉斯，討論歐洲經濟問題。消息靈通方面謂，討論範圍集中於馬歇爾計畫，英當局竟力向克萊頓刺探詳情，俾爲星期五在巴黎舉行之三國外長會議作一準備。</p>
<h3>蘇聯顧問團已飛抵巴黎</h3>

<h3>外長會議在即巴黎積極籌備</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿三日電〕此間英蘇二國大使館及警察局已在佈置一切，準備迎接英國外相員文與蘇聯外長莫洛托夫廿七日抵此開會，幷採取保護之措施。衆料會議地點將在外交部皮杜爾之大辦公廳內舉行，但官方人士則謂尙未擇定云。</p>

<p>〔合衆社莫斯科廿三日電〕關於匈牙利政變問題，英國駐蘇大使彼特森頃於本日下午以新照會一件，送達蘇聯外長莫洛托夫。以答覆蘇聯上過對英國第一次照會之覆文。新照會內容未予宣佈。</p>
<p>〔合衆社匈京廿三日電〕匈牙利總統蒂爾第頃向「維拉哥廣格」報發表談話稱，匈牙利人民必須向左走，以推行與蘇聯合作之計劃，取得蘇聯之信心，亦爲吾人之義務。</p>
<h3>擴大三外長會議　英擬邀請有關各國參加　英法對蘇聯接受邀請深表歡迎</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿四日電〕外交部人士今日表示貝文巳定廿六日下午離英赴法，出席英法蘇對馬歇爾計劃之談判。談判將於廿七日開始。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿三日電〕關於英蘇法三國外長行將在巴黎舉行會議，共商美國國務卿馬歇爾元帥所提經濟援助歐洲之計劃一事，頃據此間主管方面談稱：英國可能擴大是項三國外長會議，而邀請所有有關各國共同參加，英國在確定歐洲需要時，將設法爲關係各國覓致一項共同之方案，而不欲僅僅列舉歐洲各國之個別需要。英國並將要求所有關各國，共同予美國政府以最後之答覆，此舉可防止蘇聯提出過份大之需要數額，致與他國之需要數額不能相稱。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿三日電〕貝文外相今日在下院宣布，蘇聯政府業已接受英法建議由三國舉行會談以討論馬歇爾援歐計劃之議，英國政府亦巳同意蘇聯建議之於六月二十七日在巴黎舉行此項會談。貝文表示確信蘇聯之建議亦必能爲法國政府接受，並曰：「本人之職迎此一迅速答覆，實毋庸說明。會談當如期於本星期五在巴黎開始，本人確信必能獲得良好結果。」貝文繼乃宣讀蘇聯政府答覆之全文。保守黨副領袖前外相艾登特預祝此次會談，得有迅速而確定之進展。貝文並曰：渠將於星期五赴巴黎，立即進行此項工作。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿三日電〕法國外交部長皮杜爾本日在國民大會宣佈蘇聯政府業已接受英法兩國政府之邀請，同意參加三國外長會談，共商美國國務卿馬歇爾所提出經濟援助歐洲之計劃。蘇聯外長莫洛夫可望於星期五自莫斯科行抵巴黎，闔座聞之無不報以熱烈掌聲。國民大會議長即激進會黨領袖　歐，對於此一消息，表示滿意，並謂：英蘇法三國外長定於本月廿七日在巴黎舉行會議，晋人雖向彼等表示友好之歡迎，並祝賀此次會議獲得成功云。</p>

<h3>杜魯門將要求國會今秋召開特別會議　檢討馬卿計畫進展情形</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿三日電〕此間消息靈通人士頃談稱：杜魯門總統或將要求國會在秋季召開特別會議，以檢討馬歇爾計劃之發展情形。衆人鑒於杜魯門總統已任命三個委員會準備進行歐洲經濟復興計劃，遂益具此信心。外交界人士亦認爲總統此項措施足證政府具有以全力實現馬歇爾計劃之願望，惟待歐洲各國成立基本協議而已。據悉：美國政府所將籌設之三個委員會，其一將由商務部長哈里曼主特，負責確定美國援助外國之範圍，辦法務求其賢明與安全。其二由內政部長克魯格主持，研究美國資源所能應付歐洲需要之程　。其三將由杜魯門總統之首席經濟顧問諾斯主持，研究實行此項計劃時對國家經濟所將引起之後果與反應。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿三日電〕此間澳大利亞官員透露，已向國務院及十一國組織之還東委員會，嚴重抗議麥帥之准許日本捕鯨隊至南極捕鯨。</p>
<p>〔衆社華盛頓廿三日電〕據挪成外交界息，挪威駐美大使館上週內曾送交國務院備忘錄一件，强硬硬抗議日人赴南冰洋捕鯨。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京廿四日電〕北海這漁人一千名今日在此開會，通過決議案，要求准許在北太平洋海面即蘇聯佔領下之千島列島與庫頁羣島附近捕魚。此種請願將機續進行，不達目的不止。</p>
<h3>日本航業界　積極準備復業</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿四日電〕自麥師總部發表允許日本民間對外貿易於八月十五日恢復後，日各界受此刺激，均大爲活躍。大阪方國向爲日本航築界集中地，目前日本郵船，大阪汽船，山下汽船等公司，均積極準備復業云。</p>
<h3>美國自下月一日起恢復油類輸出管制</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華感頓廿四日電〕商務部昨夜宣布：美政府已決定自本月底起恢復油類製品之管制，因存貨减少之故。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿三日電〕美政府今日復賽施汽油輸出之戰時統制條例，此舉殆因國會議員抨堅美國汽油運往蘇聯而採取。此項統制非完全停止汽油運往蘇聯之謂，但先需商業部加以考慮，領取汽油輸出證後，方可裴運。此項措施自六月卅日起，亦即輸出條例緊急法令滿期前之廿四小時生效。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿四日電〕俄亥俄州共和黨主席魏契爾今日宣稱：衆院商船委會接獲報吿，自美運油回國之蘇聯油船係在數年前始吿建造，專供此用。其中一艘曾於兩星期前裝載汽油十二萬三千桶與其他油類一萬二千桶，自加州出航，二艘在本月初啓椗，載油十一萬五千桶，尙有三艘正在加州港口裝貨，可在本月底恢復石油出口管制以前離埠。</p>
<h3>法政府渡過難關　財政改革案經國會通過　民衆數千在會塲外舉行示威</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿四日電〕法國國民議會今日通過財長舒曼所提出之緊急財政改革措施，表法票數爲三二〇對二四一票，另五十九票棄權。該案規定增加稅收以彌補預算不足。先是國會財政委員會昨日午後二讀加以通過，上星期六初讀時曾加否決，旋因政府之急切呼籲而改變決定。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿三日電〕國民議會已於今日開始對可能影響內閣命運之財政方案，舉行兩日辯論。其先國民議會財委會，已推翻該會前此之決議，通過採納此一以援救國家危念財政爲目的之法案，當財委會討論時，門外集有多人抗議財政方案。警察事前已奉令戒備，雖出動裝甲車及催淚瓦斯配備，但並未使用，示威者秩序尙佳，未曾發生事端。羣衆在烈日下有高呼「吊死舒曼（提出該一方案之財長）警察與我站於同一陣綫」者。羣衆係在國民議會堂蒲朋宮附近各點集中，警察估計其人數當有四千人，示威者並不企圖衝入議塲，旋即紛紛散去。</p>
<h3>勃朗嚴詞切責　韓頑固份子　五百餘團體允參加協商</h3>
<p>〔新亞社漢城廿四日電〕美國代表勃朗少將本日經由公報部發表特別聲明稱：美蘇聯合委員會依照預定計劃，進行工作，但適於此際，有毫無責任感之一部分韓人發生騷動，致聯委會工作遭受妨碍。當美蘇爲朝鮮盡力之時，竟發生此類不幸事件，適足以證明韓人缺少自治之能力。此輩參加示咸之靑年，作無秩序之行動，充分表示彼等只顧個人利益，而非出發於大衆之福利。截至目前爲止，已有五百餘團體決定參加美蘇聯合委員會，共同協議樹立韓國臨時政府，此仍代表大多數之韓國人民，至於示威暴動之份子，僅只能代表極端少數之頑固韓人。</p>
<h3>蘇同意討論馬卿計劃　各方面觀感不一　有表樂觀者有表懷疑者</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿三日電〕此間外交觀察對蘇聯之無條件接受英法之邀，以共同討論馬歇爾之援歐計劃，有表示樂觀者，但亦有表示懷疑者，一切當視蘇聯是否將積極進行歐洲之共同設計以及時防止歐洲經濟之崩潰，抑饉以接受爲其在三國談判中採用拖延戰略之前奏而定。此一答案，須俟三國外長開始晤談後始能獲得，但料貝文皮杜爾兩氏，必將促使莫洛托夫就此一主要之點成立迅速決定。蘇聯今後提出之建議，値得予以密切之注意，傳知蘇聯之態度，是否確巳與眞理報前此發表之意見不同，或其接受僅爲避免他人之責其抵制西方國家復興歐洲之企圖。</p>
<p>觀察家之揣測，多集中於莫洛托夫週五晤貝文皮杜爾時所將提出之條件，就書聯宣布接受英法邀請之照會觀，莫洛托夫殆將首先要求獲知貝文與賴瑪迪及皮杜爾最近在巴黎所談之內容。然查事實上該次會談，純屬初步探討性質，大部份涉及英法如何與蘇聯接洽之細則問題，故料英法就該一要求，當不能有更多之情報可以吿知蘇聯。莫洛托夫之下一步驟當爲宣布其關於根據美國援助及歐洲自助之原則，復興歐洲經濟之意見。倫敦方面預料莫洛托夫於此必將聲明蘇聯參加歐洲經濟設計之首要條件，即爲此項設計必須爲純粹經濟性質者，不容附帶任何政治條件。想英法對於此一要求，當不致反對，蓋英國素主於處理世界經濟善後問題時，不得牽涉政治，而法國之政策固爲在美蘇觀點之中，保持嚴格均勢也。再者蘇聯今旣已表示接受，預料東歐國家不久亦將對馬歇爾計劃提出反響。此間人士對波蘭共產黨報紙之尙在猛烈抨擊馬歇爾計劃，甚感興趣，但料此等態度不久當能如蘇聯之最近行動，突然轉變。</p>
<p>〔合衆社已黎廿三日電〕此間人士今夜推測廿七日之三國外長會議殆將成爲蘇聯與西歐集團最後能否合作推行歐洲經濟政策，抑將分成兩個對峙集團之「攤將」塲面。法國報章亦認爲巴黎會議將具有「決定性」意義。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科廿三日電〕此間觀察家談稱：蘇聯外長莫洛托夫欣然接受英法二國之邀請，以討論馬歇爾計劃，並主張在巴黎進行三國外長會議，此對會議之進展，當已解除其重犬障碍。莫洛托夫且願親赴巴黎，而不建議在東歐接近草斯科之地方進行，亦屬前途樂觀之象徵，由此可知蘇聯願與之合作討論馬歇爾之建議。莫洛托夫答覆中所稱蘇聯政府尙不知馬卿計劃確實內容與英法二國巴黎會談之實情，此點在本週內莫洛托夫啓程前當亦可獲得補救。衆料此間英法二國犬使館當將以所有各項情報，供給莫洛托夫。此間美國大使館今雖不參預其事，但衆人亦料其當就馬卿向哈佛大學所發表之演說，以其計劃之詳細意義，通知莫洛托夫。此間一般觀感咸謂，巴黎會議之成功，關鍵可視參加各國之迅速獲致協議而定。莫洛托夫此行當負有全權，可以作重大之決定。外國觀察家則相信蘇聯加以接受後，已取得可能打破美國對歐外交之主動地位。蘇聯今與之合作擬定可以接受之復興計劃後，將使美國遭遇一項問題，即是否將以待遇西歐各國之辦法，以經濟援助給予東歐諸國。倘此項計劃擬定後，美國國會議員不予撥款，則將使歐洲轉向東面，至少東歐各國將產生厭惡美國之心理云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿三日電〕此間官方人士對於蘇聯接受邀請同意舉行三國會議討論馬歇爾援歐計劃一層雖表示滿意，但對於會議之結果則採取保留之態度。據稱：蘇聯方面嘗謂美國之生產業已在戰時增加，此實乃指斥美國在戰時致富之謂。此外，蘇聯方面並曾宣稱·歐洲之首要任務，乃爲恢復各國之國民經濟，美國觀察家認爲此種論調，頗難予以解釋，良以馬歇爾之援歐計劃，係指復興整個歐洲經濟而言故也。美國政府人士力言美國政府對於歐洲各國所採取實施馬歇爾計劃之任何建設性措施，均表示歡迎云。</p>

<p>舊金山市長與吳市長爲舊交，倍形親切。渠謂吳市長曰：閣下近况如何？上海人民近况如何？舊金山人民謹向上海人民致意問好。」吳市長曰：「一切甚好，余亦代表上海人民向舊金山人民致意。」宋子文夫婦之女公子係返華度著假。宋氏夫婦對愛女慰問有加，並以紅色鮮玫瑰一束相贈。</p>
<p>全體貴賓因應蔣主席之邀請，下機後略事休息，立即換乘中航公司XTT91及92兩客機，於一時五十五分起飛赴京，晋謁蔣主席。</p>
<p>蔣主席答覆時軍問題</p>
<p>號本報南京來電稱：霍華德等一行於下午三時半乘中航專機兩架抵京，新聞局長董顯光代表蔣主席在機塲歡迎。霍等當乘車赴政院訪張羣院長，略談數語，張院長原曾準備午宴，以霍等抵京，時已過午，臨時作罷。旋即赴司徒大使官邸祝壽，然後晋謁蔣主席。蔣主席。蔣主席夫婦在黃埔路官邸接見美記者訪問團，曾回答各記者所提出關於國際國內局勢等問題，談約二十分鐘。</p>

<h3>地局努力探救合理房租標準</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於本市房租標凖問題，記者昨日往訪地政局負責人探詢意見，承吿：本市現行房租標準，係卅五年三月間所訂定者，（以廿六年作基數，）居住房屋一四〇倍，營業用屋一六〇倍。一年來物價飛漲，此項標準至今實雞維持。蓋房主租金之收入，尙不敷捐稅，保險費，修繕費等之支出。但如廢除標準，則必使房屋糾紛增多，影響社會安寗。本同爲此曾數度邀集地產商，參議員，司法機關等會商改訂房租標準，經歸納各方意見訂定辦法十條，規定房租標準以廿六年作基數，乘公務員薪金倍數，（目前爲一八〇〇借）。此項提案經市參議會第三次大會議決保留，惟仍請由市政府參酌實際情形改訂房租標準，並取締過高租金。本市房地產業同業公會則主張依照土地法九十七條之規定訂定標準。按土地法九十七條規定：「城市地方房屋之租金以不超過土地及其建築物申報總價額年息百分之十爲限」。又土地法施行法第二十五條規定「所謂土地及其建築物之總價額，土地價額依法定地價，建築物價額依該管市縣地政機關估定之價額。」現本市法定地價雖已公佈，而建築物估價尙未辦理，此項估價工作極繁，必須有建築專家等台作，以本市房屋之多，恐窮六個月之時間尙難辦竣。此外如（一）房屋折舊，（二）屋內設備，（三）高樓之頂層與底層之出入及使用花園草坪便利不同等問題，均使租金之訂走頗感困難。而地價之估定平時五年一次，今則爲一年一次。故如依地價訂定標準，至多每年改訂一次，但物價於一年間之上漲差額不可預計，故亦屬不妥。目前欲求一各方皆感滿意之標準甚爲困難，本局現正在研究地價指數，房主實際支出，公務員薪金倍數及市民負擔能力等因素，以謀求得一合理之標準。</p>
<h3>參會三委會改選召集人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日市參議會自治，警政，敎能三委會分別舉行曾議，討論提案及改選召集人，召集人名單爲，自治：　夏，陳保泰，朱文德·警政：費樹聲，侯寄遠，張迺作。教育：重行白，周斐成，徐則驋。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕中庸洋行伊拉克人愛司加登違法經營金鈔交易，擾亂金融一案，承辦該案之陳壽陶檢察官曾將該行賬册交會計師審查，茲據會計師審查報吿，提出三項要點：</p>
<p>（一）中庸洋行之分錄簿，在本年二月十五日以前，完全以美金爲記賬單位，自二月十五日以後，以國幣數額同時記載，其折合率美金一元合國幣一萬二千元，然其收付究以國幣抑以美金爲單位，於賬面無從分別。（二）本年四月一日起，分錄簿之記載，尙未過入總賬。（三）自本年二月十六日起，截至四月十七日止，根據分錄簿，證明以現金收付者，共計收入美金三萬一千二百八十五元二角九分，合國幣三億七千五百四十二萬三千四百八十元，支出美金一萬九千八百四十六萬九角九分，合國幣二億三千八百十六萬三千八百八十元，其中有關客戶證券之支出者，計美金一萬七千九百十六元九角九分，惟四月一日曾付美金六百元，（包括甲·客戶證券三百元，乙·費用三百元，於摘要內註明登記費用字樣）倘亦列入計算，則與摘要之數不符。另銷貨簿一册，自二月廿五起至四月廿四止，爲數甚巨。</p>
<h3>赤痢傷寒已有患者</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕赤痢傷寒與霍亂爲夏季三大疫病。現本市赤痢傷寒皆有患者，但爲數不多，其流行期根據去年經騐當在八九數月。霍亂則去年係於五月二十三日發現，本年至今尚無患者，現天時漸熱，衛生局正加緊防範。</p>
<h3>荊江大堤險象環生鄂同鄉向各界呼籲　張知本等報告嚴重情形</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕湖北旅滬同鄉會，昨午四時，假座南京路沙利文招待本市各界，由最近從故鄉（江陵）描墓歸來之張知本報吿湖北之水息與匪患日漸嚴重情形，並向社會人士呼籲，希望政府速謀有效之補救辦法，拯救數千萬災民。</p>
<p>秋汎期間不堪設想</p>
<p>張氏略謂：湖北數十縣民命所關之荊江大堤，現已險象環生，沙市與郝穴間之祁家淵大提堤脚已崩裂，堤內已有一深潭，因江水水位高出地面數十尺，一旦堤防崩毀，鄂省有陸沉之虞，今年桃汎倖已勉渡，惟秋汎轉瞬又屆，因抗戰期堤身失　，且受砲火摧毀，而負責修堤之江漢工程局，在冬季水位低落時期，旣不預加修築，現水位日漲，該局乃以細木蘆　草草修補，秋汎一至，其危險實不堪設想。</p>
<p>洞庭湖面日漸縮小</p>
<p>洞庭湖日漸縮小，儲水量銳减，因有少數具有地方惡勢力者，將湖邊淤地，　築堤垸，墾殖湖底，雖早經政府明令禁止，且由行政院水利委員會組織監創委員會督令創毀此種私堤，但一再延宕，迄今尙未遵令切實執行，致使洞庭湖失却調節功用。</p>
<p>匪息方面，本年農歷元旦郝穴鎭被匪徒洗刧，聞當時匪徒僅數百人，後渡江南竄入公安縣及湘鄂邊境，近又回竄北岸，侵擾當陽等地，嘯聚已達數千，若不從速剿除，將爲湘鄂大患。</p>
<p>河床之高並於屋脊</p>
<p>繼由胡秋原錢納水相繼就荊江大堤安危關係之重大，加以補充。綜其要點如下：（一）荊江大堤祁家淵一段，連年被江流衝刷，堤脚蝕毀將半，現伏汎迫近，趕修工程，未能切合實際需要，以致人心惶惶，寢食不安。（二）荊江大堤爲江陵，監利，沔陽，潛江四縣及荊門與漢陽各一部分生命財產之屏障，該堤長百餘里，高聳至十餘丈，而河床則已與堤內之屋脊爭高，任何一處潰決，數百里內房屋均必捲沒，數百萬人民無法逃生。（三）洞庭湖原爲長江上游蓄洪之所，大通湖所挽各垸（以天祜垸爲總名稱），縮减蓄洪量甚大，足以增高江面水位，更加重荊江大堤之負担，尤其祁家淵一段之危險性，中央政府雖已明令刨毀，由於當地少數地主之阻撓，迄未動工，最近且有暫緩創毀之說，此不啻置數百萬生命於不顧。（四）大通湖各垸若不刨毀，其結果不僅使長江上游兩岸有運受大水災之虜，即湖南境內亦有不少縣分受其害，故前此湖南明達之士，主張禁止洞庭湖築堤挽垸者，不乏其人。同時，洞庭湖蓄洪量縮减之害，尙不止此，所有湖北境內乃至長江下游沿江地區，亦必因江面水位增高，有潰堤之虞。</p>
<p>刨毀命令應救貫激</p>
<p>（四）大通湖各垸刨毀，縱影響一部分人民生計，亦不過數萬人至多十萬人而已，以視數百萬數千萬人民生命財產之安危，利害輕重，實不可以道里計。何况中央政府對各該垸人民已有救濟費之撥付。（五）大通湖各垸存廢問題，並非湖北人與湖南人之　執問題，實應從整個國家立塲及人道觀點着眼。蓋荊江大堤一潰決，即有數百萬生命犧牲，此在國家實爲一大損失，亦有背於人道。荊江大堤潰決之害，固在整個國家，其他江堤潰決，亦何莫不然，不過荊江大堤潰決之禍更慘耳。（六）荊江大堤在前淸非常重視。如有潰決，各級行政官員，便須問罪，因該大提曾屢發庫銀培修，稱爲「欽工堤」俗呼之曰「皇堤」，其關係民命之重大，由此可見。爲保障該大堤之安全，洞庭湖向不許與水爭地。國民政府成立以後，初亦未嘗對此關係綦重之大堤，稍加忽視，戰前連年年款塔修，一同往昔，不許洞庭湖築垸妨害蓄洪，亦米地禁。此次刨毀令下已久，迄不嚴屬執行，實令人惶惑莫名。（七）希望新聞界主持公道，促政府從整個國家利害及人道立塲，督　荊江大堤尤其祁家淵險工加緊趕修，並立即厲行貫澈大通湖各垸創毀之命令。</p>

<p>周詭稱該貨爲香港路五一號永興西藥行經銷，由祁電詢永典，趕往調查，始知周以贗貨充市，乃投報老閘警局，派員將周拘捕，並馳往其家抄查，搜出贗品煻精十餘聽，及小瓶裝十八瓶，包頭三十八包，其中糖精悉以粗糖對冲，外貼中南糖精廠出品標識，並說明甜度爲五百度，以及其他冒牌圖章商標等物頗夥，經警局將周嚴鞫，猶圖抵賴，並稱此物係向南京路一四六弄十七號中福藥房經理陳明祥處購來，旋又將陳傳局詢究眞相，並派員至中福查騐，並無有假貨摻雜，後周始直認係一人所爲，此案業經該局偵查完畢，將於日內移送地檢處訊辦。</p>

<h3>羣聲遭逢勁敵慘敗於星華隊　隊員行動越軌大受指摘</h3>
<p>〔中央社新加坡廿四日電〕星華隊與羣聲隊昨夜籃球賽，星華以四十六對四十一分獲其應獲之勝利，觀衆約一萬人，異常擁擠，英駐馬來並及新加坡總督麥唐納夫婦，及我國總領事伍伯勝夫婦亦到塲。球賽開始時，至爲緊張，兩方勢均力敵，惟因羣聲隊之缺乏良好運動道德，而發生小爭執，第四局開始時，羣聲隊被罰一球，該隊提出反對並作激烈爭辯，彼等以不能改變公證人之裁判，乃拒不繼續比賽，經伍總領事勸解後，始重新比賽，自此羣聲隊即常爲觀衆所噓，表示抗議，其缺乏運動道德，羣聲並採取粗暴戰術，以致星華隊佔勝九分而時間僅餘四分鐘時，羣聲隊又以個人技術犯規被罰，彼等乃以離塲爲要挾，其右衛楊人輝甚且侮辱罰其犯規之公證人，因此渠被判出塲，重新比賽時，其前鋒陳金置故將星華隊健將侯湖推倒於地，因此亦被判出塲，自此羣聲隊雖作最後反攻，卒以五分之差戰敗。第一局羣聲隊以十一對七佔先，第二局星華以二十四對十五追上，後此該隊始終佔先，至第三局絡塲時，仍以三六對三十佔先，至末後羣衆至爲憤激，有在塲之一羣觀衆，將羣聲隊圍於體育塲之一角，得免發生意外，羣聲運動道德欠佳，今日各報多予以嚴厲指斥。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕米市於星期日及端節連續休假二日後，昨日開始營業，行客擁擠，羣情熱烈。因節假休業關係，各帮多欲進購，去化激增，加以受其他物價高漲影響，人心一致向榮，粳薄稻竟迫及五十萬大關，至收盤時稍吿回軟，但較上周已　起二三萬元。陰白元因端節已過，去路轉呆，故市勢尙平。</p>
<p>昨各帮登記到貨，計南市一七九六石六斗，北市四二六三石。高白粳交易價四十六萬五千至四十七萬元，特常粳做四十八萬。薄稻四十七萬五千，早稻四十六萬。暹　尖四十五萬，羊秈四十一萬至四十一萬五千元，碾秈三十七萬至三十八萬，白元四十五萬至四十五萬五千，陰元四十三萬。</p>

<h3>抑止食油漲風　中信局撥豆榨油</h3>
<p>連日豆油漲風漫無止境，廿四日晨開盤，漲風尤熾。豆油每担計七十二萬元，後以囤戶紛紛拋出，驟跌至六十六萬元，收盤回至六十八萬元，各貨平均價格約漲一萬五千元至二萬元。中信局有鑒及此，認爲如不急謀增加生產，及避免流入中間商之手，　足以消　漲風。</p>
<p>該局特於二十四日下午三時，召集第三區植物油煉製工業同業公會重要負責人，舉行會議，結果決由該局前由東北運進大宗大豆第一批，先撥出二千三百噸，交由該會代榨豆汕，各廠分配數量亦已確定。中植油廠爲七百六十噸，大有餘四百噸，大昌新夏德各三百八十噸，順裕同甡泰各一百九十噸，預計交貨後一週內，以東北大豆每担產油一〇·五斤能率推算，可能生產豆油二百四十一噸半，合計四千八百卅担，屆時將由該公會全部交予中信局，由中信局撥交民食調節委員會配售之。至各廠代榨手續費，規定每担原料計國幣兩萬元，至豆餅出路，則擬由各廠備價購買云。</p>
<h3>社會局長談　物價波動主因　投機家造謠生事</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局吳局長昨稱：端節後物價又起波動，市塲謠言衆多爲最大原因。彼輩唯恐天下不亂，故散播五萬元大鈔將發行等流言，當局實辯不勝辯。米價漲係因受日前風雨影響，到貨較少所致，現天已放晴相信即可轉平。物價評議會本月內不擬召開，蓋如紗布由紗布調節會管制，煤由燃管會管理，米已恢復自由賣買，食糖則由小組會議價。</p>
<h3>華股市况轉盤大戶由多翻空</h3>
<p>華股昨紗花帮展帮等游資繼續吸收，港申電再吿慘縮，永紗中途屢有蠶動。無如業中大戶由多翻空，漲勢遂乏襯托。塲外貼息更開高至三角六及四角零五，漲風旣已轉盤，買戶遂感負担維艱。且檯面散買，在聞後低價咸有加碼，臨收前在「到本」限度下迫於時間，無法再事頑抗，最後終於由緊轉疲，咸以低價結束。</p>
<p>晨初隔前國行雖有巨額差進，但以港申電慘縮，港方並傳中美貸款不利流言，除內衣開低半成外，餘股尙開高盤。遞永紗開後由一四號一〇四號一四二號一六〇號進至九〇〇〇元外，九七號一四八號八號二四號九一號二二三號五五號六五號乘高了結，降至八七八〇元，一二九號三六號二二八號二三一號趁低進至八九〇〇元外，六一號九七號六五號仍賣，是時因二三一號一〇四號一〇五號尙具納胃，在八八〇〇光及八九〇〇元間頗多掙扎，銀根仍緊，九七號一三四號二四號五六號二〇七號一〇五號一二一號四九號紛紛脫手，遞永紗乃跌至八六五〇元左右。經二二四號乘低補空，一四號一五三號二二三號三二號一〇七號一〇五號一三五號一四二號一八三號六九號次第吸納，逐步回好。二三一號一〇六號出後覆進，而升至九〇六〇元。入後在九千元關內外，曾有拉鋸局面，終以港申電傳報縮至十一元訊，人心仍俏，一四號二二四號二三二號八三號二二三號一四八號五七號一八五號都進，而升至九二二〇元，一八六號二三號趁高有供，退至九一〇〇元，二一八號一〇二號一五二號一七一號力購，乃將遞永紗拉高至九二三〇元。六一號一九七號九四號一工四號一五五號二〇七號一六三號脫手，退至八九〇〇元。一八八號一五二號一七一號雖進至九千元外，二一九號二二四號二〇〇號二二三號一四二號六五號二一三號奮加脫售，一五七號並力現售遞永紗較多，近收時浮多成有了結，並傳和平空氣，遞永紗步降至八五六〇元。一〇四號有納而以八六〇〇元結束。收後喊高至八六八〇元。惟現永紗終以八四〇〇元低價收市。景綸曾吿跌停。結果較前收即交各股計永紗信和美亞景　微降，華豐永公勤興跌半成左右，新光中法各跌半成强，新華跌成半强，麗安榮豐火柴水泥微挫，景綸跌停後有回，軋跌成半。商務中紡大通中絲國貨跌半成，新亞內衣五和跌一成左右。遞交計永紗信和美亞新光永公景福均吿微降，華豐跌半成强，勤興跌成半弱。塲外各老股計五洲大生閘北華商微降，中華南洋微升，世界獨平。</p>

<p>外股昨堅後　平，僅橡皮股因聞香港有下月一日起開拍之訊而見活潑。怡紗晨開七四〇〇〇元，高價八二五〇〇元，最後以七六〇〇〇元結束。較前收計英聯微降，怡啤航業漲半成强外，餘均微升。證券帮進後有售，廣帮北帮以及洋商則進，而散戶則仍有了結。</p>

<p>本市北帮紗布商號中國紗布公司，天津誠興，永豐紗布申莊，北平國泉紗布申莊等百餘家，以北述紗布受管創後，業務極受影響。昨特聯名電呈紡調會，請求撤銷紗布北運管制，准予自由運銷，體恤商艱，以裕民生。</p>
<h3>紗布均見挺升</h3>
<p>棉紗市况晨開尙平，散戶吐售，旋因北帮匯滬鉅額頭寸，市上銀根轉鬆，塲中買戶驟吿執閙，各紗喊價由穩定而吿猛升。四二支藍鳳紗劇漲一百萬元，爲一千六百五十萬元。廿支特　馬軋升三十萬元，雙馬紗漲十五萬元，十六支光明哄高至八百四十萬元，狂升七十萬元，市氣頗形俏利</p>
<p>棉布晨開，因業中有供售，十二磅龍頭細布下挫至卅八萬四千元，嗣聞紗價上揚，客帮踴躍進取，行情止跌回升。結果龍頭細布昻至四十萬元，比上日步漲六千元。五福彩球振中等細布俱升三五千至一萬元。深色士林布及藍布，因坯布迭漲，上升二三萬至六七萬元。其餘漂布元直貢綢等，價均激漲。</p>
<h3>現棉喊價續高</h3>
<p>昨日現棉市况，因棉紗漲勢再接再厲，港匯通續報縮，人心極度堅俏，兼之內地花紗價格隨之飛騰上漲，執貨者咸不願輕脫，前途一致看直　故交易頗稀。午後同業做開送廠價計　寳一九〇萬，漢口細絨一六六萬至一七〇萬，冲沙市一七〇萬至一七二萬，又棧交價計靈寳一八九萬〇，沙市一七〇萬，漢口細絨七萬，白洛去一八七萬，大中集一細絨一六八萬，渭南一八五萬五干，南太倉一三五萬，冲通州一四五萬，浦東火機一二四萬至一二五萬，一二七萬，周浦籽花二二萬五千，至二四萬五千，又未成交而有喊價者計白洛去喊價一九二萬，通州喊一五〇萬，老河口喊一五五萬。</p>

<h3>廠商請恢復輸入　製造鉛筆原料</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市金城·上海·中國標準等鉛筆廠，近以舶來原料洋杉及石墨粉，遭禁止輸入。國內木料，則取給於台灣之檜木。近以台省府改組，檢木出口證，亦暫停簽發。該廠等近乃請工商輔導處代爲出具證明書，俾聲請台省當局，仍恢復簽發出口證。一方面仍望輸管當局，能酌量准許轍入洋杉及石墨粉，則國產鉛筆，在技術上亦能與外貨並駕齊驅。至國產檜木及石墨粉，則可供製普通鉛筆之用。預計三廠之產量，足數全國之需用云。</p>
<h3>六千萬美元日用品　係由聯總剩餘物資中撥出</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨載美國以六項日用必需品助我平價出售一訊，茲經關係方面表示該項物資之由來，緣聯總曾動議在該署結束後，在所餘救濟物資美金三億五千萬元中，將循我所請，撥出一部份（約値美金六千萬元）予我，內以糧食佔大部，其他尙有苦干另呈醫藥用品等。刻聯續對該項救濟物資之分配，尙在洽商方案中，將來如獲通過運　後，可能仍撥交各地地方政府分配。</p>
<p>至中央信託局將組設之配給物資顧問委員會，係因本市若千抓配給物資，與中信局均不無直接間接關係，該局爲便利聯　起見，故特組設該項機構，故與聯總分配之救濟物資，並無特殊關係云。</p>
<h3>出口商請求改善　收購出口物資辦法</h3>
<p>此次政府爲解救出口業之困難，出口物資特予收購，已由有關機關，組織代理收購委員會，負責辦理。此爲政府目前之政策，出口商一致表示擁護。惟出口商對於收購事宜，提出兩點意見，（一）收購價格，不宜過於壓低，以免出口商反因收購而受損失。（二）收購出口物資，應在出口口岸向出口商收購爲宜，如再向產區直接收購，不特與民爭利，抑且刺激物價，以上兩意見，聞桐油豬　兩業出口商，將以書面送達代理採購委員會採擇。</p>
<h3>銀樓業　代表已返滬　下月可能復業</h3>
<p>本市前往首都請願之銀樓業代表已於昨日返滬，據稱：所有當局最近規定之黄金飾金價格分開，飾金含金七成以及改稱手工製成品等數項辦法，同業間大都可能接受，因此當局決定於本月內正式公佈週知，故本市各銀樓日來正大事淸掃內部及裝璜，擬自下月份起正式復業。至於業已停業倒閉之銀樓是否亦同時復業，則須視各該負責人之意志而定，目下尙難斷言。</p>

<h3>食糖市價續緊</h3>
<p>昨糖市以人心振奮，求渦於供，價格一致高翔。査端節市塲停頓一日，但塲外交易價已轉升，昨再續緊，尤以白糖爲甚，升成許至一二萬元不等。公會劃盤，秘魯砂棧單最高做六十六萬五千元。二四組白爲六十萬元，棧單加十二萬五千元。四半車自由五十五萬五千元升至五十七萬元。三半車白初爲五十三四萬元，後亦達五十七萬元。二〇中砂白棧單四十九萬元，現貨五十萬元至五十二三萬元。汕提三十五萬五千元至八千元。棉赤三十九萬元，海南赤三十五萬八千元，刁靑高貨三十二萬元，次之三十一萬五千元至三十萬元，共成交千餘件。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕食糖市塲內秘魯砂糖，向爲一般投機者當作籌碼，從事踢皮球交易。但日來本市各項貨價又起激烈漲風，糖市受此激動，亦吿猛漲，秘魯砂昨晨竟高達六十三萬五千元，較上週末計軋漲七萬元之鉅，因之空方大起恐慌，力謀抵補。奈信益公司之棧單多被大戶囤藏，市上流通額日見减少，故一時無法補進，以致到期未能交割，發生紏紛，塲內交易，因之暫吿停頓。</p>
<h3>絲綢一致回挫</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲止漲回跌，一二〇號高山有光，二千二百八十萬元開　，因銀根奇緊，乏人過門，價　不支下挫，二百五十萬元成交後，復跌至二百萬元收盤，下午不乏乘低價　進，於是稍見　升，最後爲二千二百四十萬元賣出價，比上日跌落一百萬冗强。七五號金鷄半光，前日討價竟達三千二百萬元，昨市喊三千萬元，未會做開。</p>
<p>廠絲昨市亦稍露疲憲，做開D字等級價三千萬元，有五担交易，比上日喊價降五十萬元，其餘各級俱乏成交，喊價亦短五十萬元之譜。零担絲昨市成交價與上日相仿，高級零担雙虎牌做價三千萬元，干經昨市未聞做開，喊價無甚上落。</p>
<p>昨市綢貨因銀根關係，亦吿下降，大誠　面一千一百萬元有成交，華强被而棧單一千零八十萬元有做開，最後喊一千零九十萬元賣出。大誠格子璧縐開市四萬一千二百元成交一張後，即告挫落，四萬零六七百元亦有做開。後聞股市低落，更因多方亟需脫手，最小曾進四萬元關內，最後維持四萬元收市，隔日期做二三百元。華錦縐因原料吿跌，售價亦稍見遜色，高檔貨二萬一千元有成交，其餘各貨交易甚寂，故售價大致堅站未動。</p>
<h3>捲菸猛進疾退</h3>
<p>昨日捲菸市况墨猛進疾退之狀態，蓋以永泰和開派甲乙丙三卡大英老刀大南米大三砲及土耳其等各種香姻，大新烟公司亦派特甲乙三卡標準牌烟，市塲籌碼頓形充沛，兼有轉賣，以致喊價疾退。十支大英姻最後價爲六百七十五萬元，比之節前（二十二日）午後狂瀉九十萬元，老刀牌下挫八十五萬，爲五百八十萬元，哈德門軋小六十萬元，五華只降五萬元。全日趨勢，以廠方派貨增多，並以外匯調整等請風已經當局予以否認。市塲人心懈怠，買戶觀望，是以其餘華商烟等亦一致回落。惟美貨六根馬力斯路駝等條姻，市頗堅俏，軋升一千五百元至四千五百元不一，聽頭香姻銷路不暢，每聽回降五百元至四千元。</p>
<h3>煤市漸見轉機</h3>
<p>煤市老窿白煤及辰谿烟煤等，因產地行市繼續報升，並運輸費用等亦漲，而本地行市依然萎靡不振，與辦本懸殊過鉅，多數客帮均將到貨進棧關住，非　善價不再出售，是以人心轉堅，昨整個煤業市况突見轉機，尤以烟煤各貨回漲最厲，焦炭及白煤銷路亦大爲展開。</p>

<h3>熱烈緊張　首都的政治氣候</h3>
<p>— 南京十六日快訊　本報特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>卅四年九月，記者會由隌都搭駛京第一船上兩京，那時，這都城是處處顯留着鐵蹄的烙印。日本軍隊滿街問散，有許多高樓大厦還是日本人住着的。馬路上一個個大窟窿，寥寥可數的小型汽車，不甚多的行人，使人感着戰後首都如此冷落。當年十月，我又由上海上南京，新街口，中正路，中山路，太平路等馬路上的商店，依然被封的很多，馬路上的大窟窿塡補好的還是很少。只有秦淮河畔的夫子廟。還是恁般畸形的繁榮，酒肆裏猜拳行令，喧囂戶外。十二月，我因事再上南京，只是熟閙街衢上的店鋪多開了　　，還是感着大而無當。一年多以後，我懷着空虛的情懷，再到南京去。在未到南京以前，儘在腦筋裏盪漾着戰後首都冷落的印象。</p>
<p>交通管制較有秩序</p>
<p>首都，她已以另一種姿態來歡迎關心她的游子了。馬路上的窟窿已塡平，許多殘破了的房屋已加修茸，店鋪開得整整齊齊，公共建築也經整飾一新。尤其那馬路上的汽車排成了長蛇般來往的行駛着。一輛接着一輛的那麽的有秩序，比起上海亂糟糟的交通要好得多了。也許首都汽車的數量沒有上海的多，馬路的里程比上海的長。不過，在一個先前對她懷着空　觀感的人，現在却變得充實起來了。</p>
<p>政治氣息緊張萬分</p>
<p>首都，她已有一種重慶陪都的氣息。她很緊張，也很熱烈，雖然正是外患內憂一般人高唱着低調的時候，我還是如此感覺。我在南京，正是新疆被外蒙侵侮的時候，新聞界同業忙忙碌碌，緊張萬狀。國防部長的行踪，成了我們同業的新興趣。因此，新聞局長的燒餅會也懶得去了。他們控制了所有的交通工具，用盡了所有的方法，冀得着關於當局處理這楷外侮的消息。</p>
<p>排除萬難決心禦侮</p>
<p>我政碰曾若見中的綱要，我請敎他們對於當前時局的意見，他們認爲：「吏治是必須澄淸的，但是必須要從　層做起。當前幾個門閥，應該懲處一下，不懲處不足取信於天下。他們認爲外蒙侵侮的原因複雜，中共的態度如此强硬，要有法心，要有毅力，要排除怕難畏危的心理，拿定堅强的意志，使局而明朗起來。」是的，這說法表現着進步的力量，而這力量正支配着今天首都的緊張與熱烈的局面。</p>
<p>神經中樞不容鬆弛</p>
<p>現在，全國的人民都在苦悶着，首都是全國的神經中樞，她是應該有所決定的，我們必須堅强起來，不能再軟弱，我們必須再進一步的努力，不容再行鬆弛了。今日的首都，由勝利後的冷落度入了緊張中的繁重。擺在我們而前的工作，一面要去除內憂，一面要解決外患，另一面還要努力建設。這實在與抗戰的難苦沒有什麽兩樣。然而一般老百姓以爲勝利旣已獲得，應該享樂的時候了，盡情的享受，生產沒有進步，消費大量的增加，物價高漲，激成了空前的經濟危機。這種種的病象，都增加了政府的負擔。我覺得蘇州的物價比杭州低，南京的物價比蘇州還低，或許因爲首都所在，對物價的管制比較有辦法些罷。</p>

<p>熊佛西氏在滬時約我到南京會齊後同去遊玩。那是我到南京後的第二天，險雨新暗　　　得很大，我們到玄湖邊，船家還沒有裝蓬帳呢。呌船家，他要價三萬元，還他兩萬元便成交，　呼嘯的風，繞湖一週，右邊可以遙望紫金山麓，左後側是石頭城的巍巍的城牆。在湖的中心，有一座玄武湖的公園，面積很大，在湖中，蘆草　　，一叢叢簇擁在那裏。我問熊先生：「西子湖與玄武湖孰美？」他說；「西子像是一個大家閨秀，玄武湖則像側村野間的姑娘，你看一簇簇的蔗草，那遠遠的幾瓣荷葉，那倒影在湖中的巨大的城牆，在在都表示她是一個村野的女孩子。」我說：「假使拿玄武湖作爲風景區，當然無可厚非的，但要使人能生活在風景區裏，就要推西子湖了。」</p>
<p>金陵之襟小花點綴玄武湖，她僅是南京的襟上綴着的一朶小小的花，而西子湖却是一個花窩。因此，我會和南京很多人士談，「南京應該是政治的都會，上海應該是經濟的中心，而杭州應該是文化的城池。」他們都一致表示贊同。而且有人說：「不是嗎？杭州將設立兩個國立公國，以强調這個花都。」然而，今天政府的事情忙得不亦樂乎，重要的事情都急待處理，那有暇閒來籌辦建立文化的城池？首都，她確在苦悶中掙扎，在形態上表現熱烈與緊張，我們希望這股熱烈緊張影響了全國，使全國推上建設的道路。</p>

<h3>「中國金字塔」之謎</h3>
<p>— 西安十五日航訊　本報訊者張僊洲</p>
<p>一位美國飛行員，說他在西安南郊五六十里地方已於今春發現了「中國的金字塔」，而且說塔上還有一小廟……。電訊上如此說。——這消息一經傳出，人人相詢，中國的金字塔在那裏？怎麼樣？爲什麽在西安的人向來沒有發現西北這個「大建築？」一連串的問題提出了，中國的金字塔成爲了一個謎。</p>
<p>美國飛行員的談話看來是事實，西安人不知道也是事實。當時記者曾訪問了許多「老長安」，他們也多是東說西談，迄無定論，直到兩個月前，報上才載說：「前云西安南郊金字塔，係秦嶺圭山之誤，圭山在西安南郊，山形如圭字……云」。記者日前因事至西安南郊一行，原來「中國金字塔」不是圭山，而是圭山西十餘華里的「尖山」。</p>
<p>褐土綠樹</p>
<p>由西安向西南郊行，平疇千里，終南在望，村郭速綿，鷄犬時聞，褐土綠樹，別具風味。</p>
<p>車過秦渡鎭以後，（秦渡鎭係灃惠渠大水閘的所在地，）水田比較多點，稻田處，楊柳繞道，盡是「江南情調。」這時你會看見在林梢矗立着許多山峯，遠遠看起來，都是一片藍色。在這許多山峯當中，有一座較低的山峯，形成規則的等邊三角形，頂上有着小廟一座，這就是被認作「中國的金字塔。」——尖山。</p>
<p>削壁千仞</p>
<p>尖山在西安西南五十餘公里處，屬　縣境，山陰是削千仞，無道可通，南邊却不太陡。上山的人都是由南山道拾階攀藤而上，高約五千多公尺，和它連接的各山相較，它是「子弟」輩，但從「險」處着眼，其他諸峯，多不足與之比擬。記者等四人在山下村中，裝好了一壺開水，買了十餘枚雞子，向上進發，山係石質，上無滴水，無大樹，只是有些山花野草，及中藥如柴胡遠志之類，現在正是草茂花盛的夏天，美景可知。至山尖，登小廟，門旁有樹數株，廟係上殿兩間，廂房兩間，中祀神像，被煙燻得微逞黑色。從廟後向北遠矚渭　如帶，路網交錯。向山下看則懸崖附藤，令人胆寒。</p>
<p>山貨外運</p>
<p>山下東邊，是太平口，灃河上源之一，有山道通寗陝石泉等地，是「山貨」的一個小出口，一祖担的「火紙」，木耳，油漆從山中向外運。據說那些貨在山內價錢很低，但因運不出，遝費太貴，「出口」以後，運此原成本有高至十餘倍者。中國的交通不便，不知使多少物資，無法被人應用，這怎不令人遺憾。</p>
<p>關中年成</p>
<p>在下山之後，記者會詢一老晨，「尖山」在古代呌什麽名字？山祀何神？他說？「就呌個尖山，敬的是山神，再咧！我不知道……」我們和他談起今年的收穫如何？他給我說了許多。大體講，今年關中各縣，麥子多被「黑　」打了（按即黑穗病），情况有的地方嚴重，以關中而爲　咸陽以西各地，較去年豐收。長安以東各地收穫，不如去年。</p>
<p>一條山道</p>
<p>山脚下有一條山通，沿山而西，這路當地人呌「神仙路」，據說是唐三藏當年取經時，就是走的這路到「西天」去。現在雖是久無人行，荒草滿徑，但是人們並不把路湮沒，誰說老百姓沒有懷古的幽思呢？</p>
<p>沿神仙路再東行約十華里，就到草堂古寺，是南北朝時名僧「鳩摩羅什」的舊居也是唐時「陝西八景」之一，據云在那時，草堂寺中有一井，每晨有姻自井出，飛往長安，繞城三匝而逝。有人說：那是「瑞氣」，故八景中的：「草堂烟霧緊相連」，係指此而謂。我們到古井畔看時，不過一口破井，早已塌下，實在沒啥看頭。</p>
<p>寺內四寶</p>
<p>但是草堂寺還是有着他的「四實」，在關中各大寺內，尙可炫耀的，這是（一）鳩磨羅什捨利塔，俗稱「八寳玉石塔」，高約八尺，係玉質，計五層，均彫花紋，工頗精細，看來是「古董」無疑。（二）圭峯碑，這是一塊唐碑，係王摩詰好友裴迪所書，柳公權撰蓋，被歷代碑帖匠塌摸得字失楞角，破痕斑斑，這碑在長安的碑帖中，相當珍貴，（三）佛敎流傳碍，高約四尺，由漢以迄晚　，凡與佛門有關的巨僧名士，要者均多在碑上，我想如果誰要硏究中國的佛學史，西安南郊的古剎，資料當在不少，（四）姻霧井，就是那口破井。</p>
<p>香火衰退</p>
<p>「中國的金字塔」在那裏？在西京南郊。在中國古代的繁華區（「郭杜名區」）不過，他不是人建的，而是天然的，它不是一塊槐石條的積累，而是一整塊，這裏很少有遠道的遊客，空有山客老農，在辛苦的歲月中，偶然的到山上去採藥。聽說在烽姻連天的現在，燒香的人也不如往日那麽多了。</p>
<p>去年中共李先念部竄擾秦嶺時，尖山曾一度換上戎裝，在山周圍的村落，會建立着不少的碉堡，現在匪患雖平，但尖山在秦做區的防衛地方安靜上，還是有着他的新任務的。</p>
<h3>江西棉田</h3>
<p>— 鄱陽十五日航訊本報特約記者　俞寗頗</p>
<p>江西的棉產區域，以鄱陽湖畔的冲積地九江，湖口，都昌，鄱陽，餘干，樂平，浮梁，等縣植棉的面積較廣。九江和湖北黄梅縣間的孔龍鄉接壤，爲贛省著名的產棉區域。據中國紗廠聯合會估計：合兩省產額，共有三十萬担左右，又據該會估計，民八年至十二年，贛棉的平均產量爲四二六，六七七担，民十四年八〇七，〇〇〇担，十六年五九七，七三〇担，十八年三〇四，一〇〇担。</p>
<p>面積產量</p>
<p>贛省地處揚子江的中流，濱江帶湖，土壤氣候，最宜植棉。全省棉田面積，平均約在二十九萬餘畝，據江西經委會二十二年的估計：全省棉田，共有三十五萬〇三六畝，佔本省總耕地面積百分之〇八四，各縣棉田最多者，首推高安，湖口，各有四萬五千餘畝，次爲九江，有三萬四千餘畝，永修三萬二千餘畝，都昌浮梁，各有二萬餘畝，鄱陽，餘干，弋陽，各有一萬餘畝，其他各縣，均在數千畝至百〇畝不等。民二十四年，全省植棉畝數，共有三七八，六七四畝，較二十二年，增加二八〇，〇〇〇畝。</p>
<p>全省植棉的縣份，數雖在六十縣以上，因爲贛省素爲產米最富區域，大多數農民，對　腴的田地，多樂於植稻，對植棉的興趣不濃。贛西贛南各地，或因土壤氣候的不適宜，即種稻非宜的旱地，亦多改植其他食物。它們的認識和習性，惟知努力增加雜糧生產，淡視植棉的重要。彼輩的勞作，祗知下一分辛力，獲一分的收益，改進土壤，移植時土相宜的較新的農學，遂不加意去研究它了。</p>
<p>全省棉皮的產量，過去年約七萬餘担，據民二十四年調査：全省二十九縣棉田面積，有一九九，七四〇畝，及棉產額，共有四二，四八一担，在最近抗戰八年中，因敵禍的影響，民荒農作，棉產益見衰徽。其中以民三十年至三十二年三年中植棉而積和皮棉產量均見增加，餘均縮减。茲將民二十六年至民三十四年全省棉田面積及皮棉產量列表如下：</p>
<p>年別　棉田面積（市担）　皮棉產額（市担）　與二十六年比較　　增減百分率</p>
<p>上表除三十三年無統計外，七年來增减相較，尙增二四·八〇〇市担。抗戰初期三年中平均每年約减百分之三十，自三十年起，年有超增，而以三十一年超增最多，達百分之八五·六·三十四年雖有减少，亦僅减百分之十。</p>
<p>品質銷路</p>
<p>贛省棉種，華棉居多，且多因地命名，名異而種相同的，實佔多數。就區別簡稱，有白籽，黑籽，光籽，三種，其中種植美棉的，有湖口，彭澤，永修，少數等縣份，永修栽植的美棉系脫字棉，收穫成績尙好。其中各縣多屬中棉，品質最優的，首推湖口白籽棉，爲本省棉中最良的品種，即在國內中棉品級中，很有相當的地位。滬漢市塲稱爲九江花者，即屬此棉，它的特種，爲發育强，生產　，每畝籽花收穫，恒在一百二十斤以上甚至二百斤。但因織維粗短，不適時代的需要。贛棉舍此而外，大都產量低微。近年鄱陽上游的樂平，浮梁，德興，等縣，棉田而積和產量，比戰前增加，棉質亦頗種良好，因抗戰時外埠棉花，甚少輸進，內地手工業棉紡的原料，都所給於後方安全區，棉値旣昂，種者益盛。故農作物的生產，有時亦隨環境需要而轉移，前後適成相反。</p>
<p>贛棉出路，因爲品質的不良，大部份都供太省衣被花絮和內地手工紡織業的用。其有剩餘以供輸出的，祗九江，湖口，彭澤，永修，等縣。其輸出數量，亦祗及產額之半，其中半數，昔爲潯市久興紗廠所吸進。據歷年九江關統計贛棉輸出數量，以民十九年爲最多，計七〇·八〇九担，民九年爲最少，計四六六担，至廿年二一·六九九担，廿一年一〇·三三八担，二十二年二二·〇七二担，比之江浙陜鄂等省的棉花輸出量，是百不殆一耳。</p>
<p>增產改進</p>
<p>戰前全經委會江西辦事處，鑒於贛棉產銷的衷退，曾擬具推廣植棉計畫，逐步施行。關於促進生產的辦法，（一）改良棉種，設立棉作改良塲，造成一質量俱優的棉種，分別舉行區域試騐，並在修水流域用脫字美棉，其他各縣，採用湖口白籽棉。（二）推廣棉田，擇不宜稻作高燥輕鬆的地，改植棉花，宜於棉作的贛北各縣，槪須强制植棉，每縣至少增至棉田四十萬畝以上，造成贛北爲本省廣闊的棉產地帶。（三）合作產銷，由棉作改良塲協助各地組織棉花產銷合作社，舉辦棉作青苗貸款，直接銷售各紗廠。</p>
<p>關於發展紡織，（一）籌設紗廠，分三期進行，每期三年，完成二十萬紗錠的設置，並在九江，南昌，贛河的吉安，信河的河口，撫河的南城，袁河的宜春，分期設立紗廠。紗質精粗，紗錠數目，依棉產品質數量，適當支配，使全省紡織業，平均發展。（二）提倡手工織布，由棉業改進委員會，購置織木織機一萬台，分發農村合作社，貸給各地婦女使用。節省工力，减輕成本。（三）分設漂染整理廠，在南昌設一　染廠，專供各地土布的用。</p>
<p>去年贛省棉產，以一般而言，尙稱　稔。但面積產額，並未顯著增加，報北各縣棉苗，因夏間雨量過多，發育不長，入秋後天氣亢旱，棉作後期發育，極受阻碍，較之第一次估計時稍爲遜色。惟內地棉田而積，略有增加，比之平常年，堪稱　稔。</p>
<p>最近　省府，　於本省棉產的不振，擬自本年度，推廣優良棉種，由農林部華中棉產改進處撥給德字棉種並配備械業，以防虫害。農部督導胡竟良於去年冬由鄂到贛視察棉產，曾與省府農業院作縝密硏討，至本年增產計劃，農業院亦決積極推進美棉繁殖管理工作，並速謀恢復永修棉塲和擴充湖口棉作試驗塲，改良棉種。今後贛省棉田和產量，因市塲的需要，或可促成增產可能。</p>

<h3>敦煌藝術展覽　祖國環寶給台胞帶來了新的認識</h3>
<p>— 台北十四日航訊　本報記者楊育</p>
<p>「教煌藝術」在今日的藝術領械裏，已成了個專門名詞，它是祖光留給我們最偉大，最豐富的藝術環寳。把這些祖先的成就，移到離開了祖國懷抱五十多年甫經光復的台灣省來作一個公開展覽。這比灌輸任何祖國意識多來得切實，有効，這裏可以吿訴連祖國的地圖也感到模糊的台胞：當一千五六百年前，全世界還停留在黑暗，愚昧，混沌的時候，而我們的祖先已經在敦熄石室裏創作了如此輝煌優越的藝術，更何况這些還祗是出於匠工之手？</p>
<p>壁畫塑像　六朝北魏名作</p>
<p>展覽的作品近百幅，全部是中央硏究院敦煌藝術硏究所硏究員潘絜茲先生在卅四年從敦煌的莫高窟以及安西的楡林窟中臨幕下來的。爲了增加台胞的了解，在會塲的入口處，羅了副西方文化東漸在甘肅敦煌與中國本位一藝術混交的大地圖，這樣記者在會塲裏還聽得有人輾輕在問，敦煌究竟在中國的什麽地方？莫高窟的來源，這裏也用文字加以　單的說明，「陽關古道接天竺，西連佛國猶比屋，沙門樂　托缽來，步入敦煌鳴沙麓。」這是高一涵光生敦煌石室歌的起首四句、根據考證，　在西元後三五三年，這裏就開始　窟，用紅土塗平了窟壁，　上了經變（佛經變相），故事（佛經上的記載），菩薩，圖　與佛的供養人。同時也有佛　　像，塑傑。最早的有六朝，北魏，唐代的藝術已至登峯造極之境，所以留下的也最外，其次就是宋元之作，層層塗盡，據說窟壁上可以剝下好幾層時代不同的作品來。</p>
<p>莫高窟碑　勾起無限憧憬</p>
<p>好多參觀的台胞，惋惜於我們沒有能好好保存這些國寳，幾十年來却讓　爲英國人做間諜的匈牙利人斯坦因，僅化了五百兩紋銀，就從教煌的化緣道士王圓據那裏，盜買了宋代僧人逃避西夏侵略時而牢牢封在泥洞中的經書精華近二十多箱運到了倫教，法國敎授伯希和也接踵而至滿載而歸，及至這種藝術爲全世界震驚的時候，可憐我們這些子孫却祗能慚愧地承受到七千卷左右的殘書粹紙。有一個台胞這樣問我：「就不能交涉拿回來嗎？」我漲紅了臉望他苦笑笑！</p>
<p>使台胞感到有趣的。是一塊有着漢·回·蒙·藏·西夏·梵文六個文字的元至正八年的莫高窟碑，說明了這個朝代的强盛，着實勾起人們感慨無窮的憧憬。</p>
<p>許多參觀者一面看一面歡喜提起去年的全省美術展覽來作比較，那些充滿了東洋風味沒有一點淳厚邃遠的手法和童境的作品，到今天才得到一個評價。盛唐年間富麓堂皇的佛像，朱代純熟的綫條，元代粗細有致的作風，在繪畫的技術上寫下了一部輝煌的歷史，這足以睥睨全世界的歷史</p>
<p>妓女髮形日人依樣葫蘆</p>
<p>唐代捨賤從良的妓女，也做了供養人被實在壁上，她們的頭髪和今日畫片上看到的日本妓女幾乎是同一個形狀；故事書中有幾個孩子的服裝是條背帶褲，一件沒有領口像目下流行的香港衫，這些多引起參觀者會心的微笑。</p>
<p>臨摹不是件容易的事、殘破的要補，遺漏的要塡，糢糊的要仔細看着摹，潘先生說他面對着這些褪了色的壁書在　黑的洞窟裏整整坐了一年，雖然是亡羊補牢，可是這些作品仍能顯示祖國的崇高偉大，却已使作者獲得最値得安慰的代價。尤其是這些　寳，今日得能給予重入祖國懷抱的台胞以一種新的認識，新的融璈，這喜樂不僅是屬於記者一個人的！</p>
<h3>黃泛區　干戈乎？玉帛乎？</h3>
<p>— 鄭州十四日航訊　本報記者范世勤</p>
<p>有人說：目前希臘已經成爲世界上兩大對抗的制度的試騐塲。那來我們可以說：我們的黄泛區實在是個以建設代替武力平定騷亂的試騐塲。那裏現在還有部分共軍在肆擾地方，政府已經不了決心：把這黄泛區重建起來，在這重建中，那末是否「干戈化玉帛」，還是「玉帛成干戈」呢？</p>
<p>黄泛區的難民，流浪十年，亘還鄉，其悲喜之感是不必說。現在成千成萬回去的難民，先要有地方住，有東西吃；他們要是想以種出的東西吃，或者想以收成下來的高梁桿搭房子住，那末他們先要有種子去下種；要是有種子去下種，他們一定要有農工與畜口帮助他們耕穗。他們什麽都沒有，一切都要像初民一樣開始做去。</p>
<p>從黄泛區出來，東面可以跳上津浦路，北面可以走上隴海路，西面可以踏上平漢路，它在這三條鐵將的三角地帶內，出入方便，是中國其他地區所少有。那個地區，過去縣爲中原的糧庫，尤其杞縣，太康，淮陽，睢縣一帶所產糧食特豐。據說：在七年前，僅淮陽一縣年產麥四百萬担；而睢縣也可以出三十萬担。就是棉花一項而說，睢縣一縣也出一百萬斤以上，像洧川，通許，杞縣，太康等縣這都有大量棉花出產。</p>
<p>爲着種植棉麥的農產品，所以聯總行總的專家們，希望用曳引機大規模的耕種，而且在淮陽等地作了試騐。據那些專家們的意思；訓練農民施用曳引機並不難，因爲他們可以先敎會河大農學院的學生，其次敎會一些高中學生，再之敎會一些初小學生，最後農民自然也會施用了。他們所感覺困難的，是農民握有土地權的太少，譬如像淮陽的農民有百分之五十以上的農民，其最大額的土地權，只有十畝。像這樣分散施用的土地，要用大規模的曳引機來耕種，簡直要使曳引機無用武之地。對於這層，那些專家是希望每六個或八個村莊的農民合作起來，施用曳引機。如果這個做法，那末就是形成一種集體農塲。黄泛區在這一方面，又是一個新社會的試騐塲。</p>
<p>從工業方面的眼光來看：黄泛區大之有建立紡織廠，麪粉廠，榨汕機（因爲黃泛區產有大量花生，芝蔴）的必要，小之有設立磚瓦廠，鞋廠，蓆廠等的必要，這是爲了自給的。關於前者大規模的工廠，設計者主張設立在鄭州，開封兩地，因爲這兩個地方可以就近利用安陽，焦作·　縣一帶的煤作爲燃料。鄭州目前替黄泛區工業建設的前途，　了第一塊路石，那就是已經籌備了一個農械製造公司，資本是二十億，第一期十億已經募足。據說這個公司還可以製造曳引機，不必再向外國去運這東西。</p>
<p>在黄泛區裏，廿多歲的靑年，多半不認識一個字，敎育問題是非常嚴重。那裏，地已是爲蛇蟒蜥蜴所集，人已是爲蚤蝨虫毒所園。至今我們還沒有聽見一個敎育學家或是衛生學家討論過黄泛區內的敎育與衛生問題。黄泛區的復興，不僅是農業與工業的問題，敎育與衛生問題也是沒法抹殺的。政府旣然決心重建黄泛區，自然對於這兩方面也不必要記者乾着急吧。</p>
<p>這個黄泛區是否重建得起來，大家會懷疑：譬如聯總的救濟物資老是成爲了共軍掠刧的對象，那末以後你一面建設，他一面破壞，着你建設成功還是他的破壞成功？如果我們果眞承認在破壞之下沒有建設可談，那我們得否認在洶湧黄水破壞之前究成了堵口的建設工程的事實。現在在黄泛區　竄來　去的幾個共軍頭腦，像樓鳳鳴，金紹九之類，都是黄泛區裏的人，他們的部下差不多都是當地的人，要是黄泛區的建設工作認認眞眞的幹，即使共軍的頭腦兒始終倔强下去，但是他們所有的部下覺得有條大路給他們走，自然會和他們的頭腦兒閙拆夥。這樣破壞就在建設而前低頭。干戈成了玉帛——。黄泛區的重建，在復員的意義上還是小者，在以建設代替武力平定騷亂是其意義之大者。</p>

<h3>敎塲</h3>
<p>— 洪爲法</p>
<p>况周儀的「選巷叢談」上載有嚴廷中的「揚州好詞」，調寄望江南，其中一首云：「揚州好，午倦教塲行：三尺布棚談命理，四　洋鏡　春情；籠烏賽新聲。」這是前淸光緒末年塲州教塲之情景，證以筆者幼時所見，所寫可謂逼眞。</p>
<p>教塲地點屬於新城。新舊城人赴救塲者，總稱爲下教塲，此一『下』字最是特別。在筆者幼時，每聽到下教塲三字，使覺另有親切意味，因爲教塲是孩子們最喜逗留的地方。</p>
<p>教塲四周，在過去幾乎全長茶社和麵館。其中也很有些典雅的名字，如惜餘春，碧蘿春，靜樂園，九如分座等。這些茶社和麵館皆是成年人　集之所，却非孩子們的樂園。教塲之所以成爲孩子們樂園的，乃是因爲教塲中心有一片廣塲。在這廣塲中，從吃到要，幾乎色色皆有。</p>
<p>就筆者記憶所及來說，許多糖果擬上，都是一面賣箝，一面做糖，如花生糖，芝蔴糖，生　糖等。孩子們都是先者做糖，等到一鍋糖做好了，這才掏錢買糖。自已吃幾塊，還嬰帶回幾塊。在孩子們的心裏，似乎吃那看着做好的糖，香甜以外更有一種滋味，會覺到異樣快感的，</p>
<p>糖果而外，出賣蟲魚，花，島的地方也極爲孩子們所喜悅。蟲子在夏秋兩季爲最多，如呌蚰子，金鈴子，紡織娘，蟋蚌等等，孩子們可以連同篾籠，紙盒，泥盆一買再買。金魚除嚴冬外，都可買到。大多是很小的，這慶，孩子們可以一買若干條，欣欣然有得色。花的方面，以草本爲多，因爲價錢不大，孩子們買去以後，枯萎掉就算了，家長們也不致大加賣難的。此外鳥兒索價高的如百靈畫眉等，孩子們雖然祗可帶着鑒賞的心情獃相着，不過自已却也可買幾隻小麻雀去喂養的。</p>
<p>上述以外，另有跑馬賣解和弄雜要的。一班嚷着「在家靠父母，出外靠朋友，」「靠山吃山，靠水吃水，」和「有錢的丟丟錢，沒錢的帮帮塲子，」所謂走江湖的人們也都集在教塲裏。孩子們雖沒錢丟，却會帮帮塲子，在塲子上大人們的肘腋下環來鑽去，其樂無極！</p>
<p>至於「揚州好詞」中所說「三尺布棚談命理」，實有測字，相面，推命，合婚，以及文王課，大六壬，乃至於黃雀銜牌等等的不同，錯落分佈在教塲的各方面。孩子們不知命理，却很好奇，因此常會團在黃雀銜牌的那裏。要西洋景的也很多，村姑俗子喜歡，孩子們也喜歡。所謂『四　洋鏡　春情』者，那紙是帶有秘密性的一兩張片子，要西洋景者藉以誘惑觀衆的。　及以後，俗子色舞，村姑面赤，孩子們神情猝雙，却都不便公然宣談的。若說「籠烏門新聲」，這在孩子們也祇有看看。因爲鬥新聲的籠烏，都是比較高貴。托着這些比較高貴的籠島在教塲上露臉的，必然是帮會中人，才能免於欺負。原來要　島有悶籠亮籠之分。悶總僅是一面外露，這是普通人都可要。如是亮籠，四面無遮欄，而又不是帮會中人，便將有人說着『朋友！借給我要要！』從他手上搶過去了。</p>
<p>這些情景，自從教塲改爲菜塲以後便多更變。廣塲上搭着白鐵棚·一間問的分隔着，看去是整齊不少，却失掉若干天趣。每天熙來　往的多是買魚蝦菜蔬的主婦們。近時偶過其地，回想舊時淸景，眞令人悵惘廉已！</p>
<h3>悲多芬與塞呂賓尼</h3>
<p>— 東方蒙霧</p>
<p>「樂聖」悲多芬於一八二三年曾有一信給塞呂賓尼，信中說：「我敬重你的作品超乎所有其他劇場的作品。當每回聽到你的一個新作，我是在沉醉中，對它的興趣史大於對我自已的作品：總之，我敬重你和愛你…你始終是我同時代中我所最敬重的一位，似如你顯意給我一種莫大的榮辛，這是，若你給我寫幾個字，那就很可以安慰我。藝術結合衆人，尤其結合眞正藝術家，而也許你肯把我也算在這些人中間」。結果是，塞呂實尼始終沒有回　這封信。</p>

<h3>蘇北歌謠</h3>
<p>— 張鳴春</p>
<p>最近在束榮松所編『泰縣鄉土教材』中，發現下面兩首農歌：</p>
<p>一，</p>
<p>日出東方黃一黃，</p>
<p>鄉村姐兒下田忙；</p>
<p>花鞋脫在田岸上，</p>
<p>褲子一捲就栽秧。</p>
<p>二，</p>
<p>早上來，</p>
<p>露水多，</p>
<p>我送情哥里把路；</p>
<p>脚下花鞋跑濕了，</p>
<p>怎樣家去見公婆？</p>
<p>公婆面前談了謊，</p>
<p>就說下田看秧科：</p>
<p>早稻田裏少車水，</p>
<p>晚稻田裏夾科多，</p>
<p>黃豆許多空殼子，</p>
<p>芝麻田裏雀兒多。</p>
<p>公婆一聽笑洋洋，</p>
<p>眞個當家好大娘。</p>
<p>讀這兩首農歌，彷彿在讀詩經裏的國風，呌人發生新鮮活潑，野趣橫生的快感。倘與都市裏修養有素的詩人作品相比，正如以鄉村健美的女孩子與都市美人相比，總覺後者化裝太過，失却天然。</p>
<p>第二首之所以特別可愛，竊以爲還有個重要的因素，就是能將勞動與愛情配合。爲要說明起見，不妨舉兩首有名的客家山歌來對比。一，</p>
<p>水灘頭洗來菜，</p>
<p>那個親哥打石來，</p>
<p>你要自菜拿條去，</p>
<p>你愛戀妹夜哺來。</p>
<p>二，</p>
<p>月落山頭步步　，</p>
<p>細妹担水出河唇，</p>
<p>洋錢偷落妹水桶，</p>
<p>囑咐細妹莫閂門。</p>
<p>洗菜挑水，揉合着調情與密約，顯見那不事生產而以愛情專家姿態出現的公子小姐們之可恥可惡。</p>
<p>筆者對上文所舉的兩首泰縣歌謠，尤有偏愛。固其所謳歌的，乃是蘇北農村去崩潰以前的太平景象，起碼是民國初年的盛事。而今慢聲低唱起來，恍惚身在桃花源，令人依稀聽到達村的鷄犬，足以暫忘現實，聊快須臾；不僅勾起兒時鄉村生活的畫面而已也。可惜現在的農民已絕無心情唱此輕快的調子了。</p>
<p>從民國初年至抗因戰以前，爲農村破產，農民不能安土樂業，只得「輕」遷到都市，尤其是上海去糊口，混來混去，只够維持動物式的起碼生活，於是他們唱着這修苦的短歌：</p>
<p>上海好　錢，</p>
<p>一去多少年，</p>
<p>心想回家轉，</p>
<p>袋裏沒盤川！</p>
<p>抗戰期間，蘇北的老百姓，除去被褫奪所有的人權以外，還要支付多方面政府的糧東與雜捐，他們又專唱着，不，是這樣的哭訴着：</p>
<p>大隊長手槍一拍</p>
<p>區長買田起屋，</p>
<p>鄉長大魚大肉，</p>
<p>保長花花綠綠，</p>
<p>小百姓號　痛哭！</p>
<p>這裏要附帶說明一下的，老百姓所恨的並不是專指上面的幾種人，他們已把敵人與漢好列在『超恨』之列，視爲虎狼，不屑以以歌謠洩憤，誰曾找到痛恨老虎的歌謠呢？</p>
<p>逼近勝利以前的時期，多少中等以下的人家，因爲遭受抽精吸　的剝削，難以維生，只有拿女兒的貞操與幸福，換取苟存。當多少農村少女嫁予或絣予那班有槍階級的小頭目時，於是下面啼笑皆非的歌謠就產生了。</p>
<p>姑娘嫁了大隊長，</p>
<p>一家才有人來養；</p>
<p>姑娘跟了勸務兵，</p>
<p>眞呌老娘氣斷飭。</p>
<p>勝利以後的蘇北，反遭受更大的災難，他們在火藥咪裏，血腥氣中，過着求死不得的生活，縱有善於編歌的李有才第二其人，諒也無創作的閒情了。而且即使有足以觀風俗知得失的民謠出現，在心麻神木的人們聽來，——其實他們根本不聽——也將認爲違反溫柔敦厚的傳統詩教的。</p>
<h3>文章與物價</h3>
<p>— 忠祈</p>
<p>一個欽墓某著名小說家的女讀者，第一次拜訪那位作家，當她週視他的屋子後，臉上似顯出一種不能隱瞞的失望。</p>
<p>「有什麼不對嗎？」主人問。</p>
<p>「是的，」那個婦人自認說，「在你的著作裏所描寫的屋子是多麼的壯觀宏大，我不懂你為什麼給你自己住在如此卑陋的地方呢？」</p>
<p>「親愛的朋友，」小說家回答，「可惜文章的價值還不及物價的昂貴呀！」</p>

<h3>記「文藝之友」</h3>
<p>— 蕭亢石</p>
<p>在十六年前，是上海各大報附刊一個鼎盛的時期，當時常在申報的「春秋」，「本埠增刊」，新聞報之「新園林，」「本埠附刊」，「茶話」，新聞夜報之「夜聲」等副刊寫稿的有周鷄晨，陳亮，周天籲，吳承達及筆者等十餘人，組織着一個「文藝之友社」，出版着一種「生路周刊」，執筆者都是在申新兩報的投稿之友，不　年而有社友三百餘人，分社遍蘇錫等地。</p>
<p>「文藝之友」，是以「以文會友」爲宗旨，記得第一次集會，是在南市半淞園，其後更作一度盛大的聯誼，是在南京飯店，此後還舉辦過足球比賽，遠足旅行。</p>
<p>自「八一三」的砲火侵　滬濱，「文藝之友」的社友彼此不通音訊者八年，勝利之初，有過一次小叙，本月二十二日，乃勝利後第二次擴大的集會。這次集會的地方，是南陽商塲內的「聯誼俱樂部」，到來賓及社友戰獨鶴，余空我，郭永熙，馮若梅，曾淹，韓景埼，周鷄晨，陳亮，朱振聲，張夢飛，芮鴻初，朱庭筠，穆一龍，張石舟，及筆者等三十餘人，十年戰亂，社員星散，世事滄桑，洵非虛語。</p>
<p>餐係「潔而精」川菜，獨鶴先生在席間致詞，即以「潔而精」啓示我們的「文藝之友」，從文章的「潔而精」推論到文友之行「潔而精」，語多警關。其次由郭永熙　空我韓景琦等先生致詞。論與由張夢飛，范文采兩先生彈詞，當塲作開篇；更有周　晟之　曲，曾淹之滑稽，經安邦之魔術，均博得鼓掌不絕。</p>
<p>「文藝之友」經此次聚餐聯誼後，決定恢復組織，通訊處斬設飛報館內。在「憂患餘生」之下，切磋觀摩，共話「苦經」，以求潔而且精，亦人生之樂事。</p>
<p>〔附語〕從事文藝寫作，以及愛好文藝的人往往很容易成朋友。原因一則是精神上有一種共同的傾向，再則從和品上可以增加互相的了解。「女人相輕」的時代應該巳經過去了，尤其從戰時到現在，文人在社會上的地位不但每况愈下，而且生活日趨艱難，在上海作協成立的時候，我也曾說過「作品無分新舊，思想無分左右，作風無分京海，年齡無分老幼」我們要聲氣相通，融洽合作。更要本着莊子所謂「泉涸，魚相處於陸，相煦以潔，相濡以沫」的精神，人友好而團結，從團結而互助。今讀着亢石先生此稿，欣聞「文藝之友」恢復組織，將從文章的潔而精一進求行爲的潔而精。以及最近春鳥詩社的成立，都是上第文藝界可喜的幾件事。特附數語，以申賀忱。（編者）</p>
<h3>托爾斯泰所讚美的作家</h3>
<p>— 東方蒙霧</p>
<p>『戰爭興和平』巨著作者L·托爾斯泰伯爵，賦性本甚乘僻，有時且是一個傲慢自大的人。但在他同時代的同國作家中，却有不少是他所讀美的。例如，他對柴霍甫之短篇小說「可愛的人」有過極高的讚美；此外，他在日記裏還寫着：「每個大藝術家，非創造自已的形式不可；如果藝爾的內容是無限地多樣的東西，它的形式也依然是這樣的……我們記得俄羅斯文學裏一切好作品，它們的形式完全是獨創的。關於首式庚，不用說了；即以果戈里的「死魂靈」說吧，那是什麼？那不是長篇小說，也不是故事，完全是獨創的東西。其次是屠格　夫所寫的作品裏最好的一部——「獵人日記」；杜思退也夫斯基的「死人之家」和「幼年時代」；嚇爾岑的「一個家庭的戲劇」；以及萊爾蒙托夫的「當代英雄」等等。」</p>
<h3>散文二章</h3>
<p>— 鐘靈</p>
<p>燈</p>
<p>我們在走向黎明嗎？</p>
<p>如今濁炬流盡了最後一滴的淚後，黑暗開始在我四周束縛攏來。我的溫暖，我的心靈的慰藉，將會消蝕在這樣寂寞和淒凉的深夜。我眞不敢嘗試以顫抖的手去拉開那天藍色的窗帘，因爲窗的外面，是一片陰森和空虛織成的黑暗，上面正浮遊着猙獰的面孔；這裏，那裏，都伸展着貪婪的舌頭！</p>
<p>林間的風吹是鬼嘯麼？樹葉簌缺落地是鬼哭麼？</p>
<p>呵！我害怕。</p>
<p>我失雲了燈，我失去了光明，此刻夜正長着麼？</p>
<p>該怎麼辦？——</p>
<p>想着燈會征服夜的黑暗，壯我孤獨者無限的勇氣……</p>
<p>想着燈會掃除四周寒冷和淒凉；給我溫暖，給我舒適的感覺……</p>
<p>想着燈會揭開一切隱服在黑暗裏的本來面目；給我安慰……</p>
<p>像一個殉道者爲着他的信念而向眞理虔誠地獻出生命一樣，我期待善會有一盞光明的燈。</p>
<p>枕</p>
<p>我曾經愛過夏天的夢，我曾經愛過這夢的橋樑。</p>
<p>有如一份紫丁香的清芬，有如一脈蜂　的溫情，這樣織柔而又熟練的揭開了我日間幻想的錦盒。……</p>
<p>畢竟我有了枕，就沒有憂　，它鼓勵起我對生之鬥爭的能氣，它時時提醒我歡樂與痛有着一條極明顯的界限。</p>
<p>從此，無視於邦黑暗的猙獰，夜晚的淒清和寂寞，慢慢地，　步在　樣；一股清芬，一脈溫情，帶給我心　上的慰藉。</p>
<p>我時常　　離去市聲的器擾，而去這夢的橋楔上檢導我曾經失落的青春碎片，當抬起頭來時，便見我心底無由的　挹，一刻不停的正流向一片寧靜藍天的河床，我逐不曾爲人間任何的詛咒和怨毒所傷害。</p>
<p>多少數不清的長夜，我獨自悄悄發拥著迢遙想的賓庫，投向這夢的　　的懷抱，輕輕地，爲它永恒青春與我相守而祝福。</p>
<h3>讀曲雜記</h3>
<p>— 蕭澡</p>
<p>（一）潮打石頭城</p>
<p>劉禹錫金陵五題自序云：『「山園故國周遭在，潮打空城寂寞回，淮水東邊舊時月，夜深還過女牆來。」樂天掉頭苦吟，觀賞良久，日：石頭城詩云：潮打空城寂寞回，我知後之詩人不復措詞矣。』</p>
<p>潮打空城句，爲詞曲家所賞識，援用殊多。元人　都刺金咬懷古云：『聽夜深，寂寞打孤城，春潮急。』運用入化，膾炙人口。</p>
<p>又吳梅村臨春閣譜洗夫人動王事，有云：</p>
<p>「別想那山繞故宮寒，潮向空城打，杜鵑血揀南枝直下，偏是俺立盡西風搔白髮，只落得哭向天涯，傷心地付與啼鴉，誰向江頭落花。眼呵，盼不到石頭車駕，淚呵，洒不上修陸松檟，只是　年秋月　悲茄。」</p>
<p>較之「我本淮南舊鷄犬，不隨仙去港人間」句，尤爲動人。</p>
<p>（二）常娥寃與漢書</p>
<p>元人關漢卿雜劇『感天動地竇娥寃』，已列爲今日世界有名悲劇之一，歌美劇塲，上演多次，翻譯之作，尤數見不鮮。在我國民間所流傳之六月雪故事，即由獲娥寃一二劇改編而來，惟俚　失眞處太多耳。關之原作，對白極佳，堪稱傑件，未有詞云：「莫道我念亡女與他減罪消愆，也只可憐見楚州郡大旱三年，昔于公曾表白東海孝婦，果然是感召得靈雨如泉。豈可便推諉道天災代有，竟不想人之意感應通天，今日個將文卷重行改正，方顯的王家法不使民寃。」</p>
<p>查東海孝婦見前漢書；「東海有孝婦，少寡無子，養姑甚議，姑欲嫁之，終不肯。姑吿鄰人日：孝婦養我勤苦，我老了久累丁壯，乃自經死。姑女吿吏日；婦殺我母；吏騐之急，孝婦自誣服，具獄上府，太守電論殺婦，郡中枯旱三年，後太守至，自祭孝婦墓，天立大雨，　熟。」後漢書　講傳云：「昔東海孝婦，見枉不辜，幽靈感革，天應枯旱。」此等意識雖甚　腐落後不足道，但由此可見古代劇本之故事，大半皆根據於載籍也。</p>
<p>（三）趙　北不撰劇典　有清一代，文化作曲者甚多，洪　思孔云亭蔣士銓李笠翁黃變清，其尤著者也。惟趙冀（　北）不作曲。　北詩鈔中有一律云：「閑不可耐，或勸予雜撰劇本以遺時日者，余老矣，豈能作此狡獪耶？謝之。」</p>
<p>「中年易感傷，故應絲竹遣流光。豈堪花月張三影，自譜琵琶趙五娘。羅　中曾三世啞，郭門高竟及身亡。</p>
<p>只餘王茗湯開遠，留得清芬在戰塲」</p>
<p>文人不作劇曲說部，亦無不可，惟以　貫中與郭門高爲戒，則未免因　　食懲　吹　，有如韓退之懷作史官矣。（按郭門高係後唐莊宗袍笏登塲時之化名。）</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>Milton說：</p>
<p>「無希望即無恐怖。」（For　where　nobope　is　left　is　left　no　fear）由這句話我想到另一個詩人說，希望與恐懼是無法劃離的，未有在希望中而無恐懼者，亦未有在恐懼中而無有希望者。</p>
<p>我們不妨放開思維的綫索，馳　於我們過去的生活歷程，我們會沒有殘問地相信上面的那句話。</p>
<p>偏見是常常造成人與人之間的痛苦的。</p>
<p>然而完全抽去主觀，即是說完全抽去偏見的談話國著作，是旣不必，亦是絕不可能的。正有如世界上無絕對的眞空一樣。</p>
<p>那個美國的傳記家魯特維希（Emil　Ludwiz）的見解是正確的，他說我們今日讀色諾豐和塔齊圖斯關於他們自己的時期最偉大的歷史著作，恰恰是因爲了他們慶成見，才覺得津津有味。個人的觀點與黨見之間，有着很大的區別。只有超然於黨派情感和利害關係的作家，才會有公平的論述。</p>
<p>對於一切事理，人們都會有各自不同的抉擇。取捨的態度便寓有各自的偏見在。所謂客觀自有其相當的限度。</p>
<p>康德之所謂純粹理性批判，在區區的理解中，並不是太單純的問題。</p>
<p>絕對客觀之不可能，正有如吾人不能將靈魂投入蒼鄉之體內一樣。</p>
<p>所以　羅古自解釋下的新現實主義的文學作品，不僅是單純的寫實，而必需寓作家尖銳的批評，自然，這批許不能因想求客觀而從俗見。</p>
<p>我的結論是，偏見不是壞事，問題是只要能躍過自私的藩離。能替相對方面多思慮五分鐘，這種所謂的偏見，總不至於會誤盡蒼生的。</p>

<h3>火車人閑話之一</h3>
<p>— 火車人</p>
<p>編者按：「火車人」爲文壞作家之一，因不願以眞姓名見示，乃以筆名刋出，希訊者注意。</p>
<p>這幾個月以來，因爲職業關係，幾乎每週必然在京滬綫上往來一回；這短短的三百多公里的行程往來一回原算不了複雜的事，不過在走了三五次來回之后，才發現自身因此幾乎每天和京滬綫火車有關。例如——</p>
<p>星期日，由南京趁車到上海，用的車票由三日以前藩辦取得的。</p>
<p>星期一，在上海先行籌辦回南京的車票，</p>
<p>星期二，回南京的車票到了手里來，</p>
<p>星期三，在上海跳上了晚車回南京，</p>
<p>星期四，早上到了南京下關車站，</p>
<p>星期五，在南京又先行籌辦再往上海的車票，</p>
<p>星期六，往上海的車票到了手里來；</p>
<p>倘若繼續再在京滬之問來回，上列七天的動作仍得重新繼都幹下去……</p>
<p>這究竟是甚麼生活—因此有人叫我做「火車人」—然而在廿六年以前，却只須每週買京滬來回票一次就可以認爲「天下太平」！</p>
<p>「火車人」這個稱呼，倒也不甚尷尬，而且因爲做了「火車人」，所以種種和火車相關的話自然特別易於留印象了；現在權且記些兒在下邊。</p>
<p>一個波蘭人</p>
<p>某一次，同坐的有一個波蘭人，說自已由歡洲到中國將近已經有半年，對古滬綫的設備根覺滿意，他最近經過的歐洲鐵路都趕不上京滬綫。這種國民外交式的詞令至少是不令人起刺耳之感的；但是后來我和他談到由波蘭到中國的旅行情狀。才知道他最近經過的歐洲就是羅馬尼亞，捷克，奧大利，意大利和波蘭五國，當然，他最近經過的歐洲鐵路也就是羅，捷，奧，意，波這五國的鐵路了，所以「都趕不上」云云，無論是否外交詞令，眞够得令人回咪！</p>
<p>答名·加薪</p>
<p>一個月以前，京滬綫的員工，有向旅客微求同意於車資加僵以作加薪之事，據報上所載簽字贊成加價的旅客巳達一萬餘人云云。員工們的薪資低薄，我們是應當表示同情去求提高的，但是據說京滬綫的旅客每年約有五千餘萬人，倘若上列「一萬餘人」之說是正確的，那末這數字和「五千餘萬人」比蛟起來，難免不是一個近乎諷刺的百分比！</p>
<p>好在不久這問題就由國家撥款貼補作了解題，省却社會統計學者來XY一番！</p>
<p>灰塵DDT</p>
<p>天氣熱了，蚊子臭蟲都出來了，對於旅行者，這當然是件不痛快的事，至少！可是半乃前的上海南京報，都說京滬綫的當局每大用DDT來給客車消毒了，好消息！有關國民健康的好消息！想來這必然是名副其實的消息，何况用的還是金洋盟友國　的聖　，鐵路當局這種服務情神眞是了不起的，算起來每一個夏季總得用好幾萬或者好幾十萬介侖DDT，從此國民健康必然可以有新的好氣象！</p>
<p>可是話得說回來了DDT的噴射，大概在客車的「保養塲」（恕我借用公路上的術語）裏實施，我們在車站上上車的人難於目擊，不過我們所目擊的却是車襄的淸潔。三四等車裏的塵士滿地滿椅甚或滿壁，固然用不着多所宣傳。就是在一二等車裏，塵土也不過化爲灰塵而一樣存在，鐵路當局對於這些塵土和灰塵似乎還沒有甚慶處理的消息。也許這是蚊子臭蟲的不幸而是灰塵和塵土的福音，否則也許金洋盟友還沒有淸除灰應和塵土的妙藥和妙計，所以鐵路當局還無以取材或者取法！</p>
<p>清水與電類</p>
<p>這話更得另外再說回來：我想「水」　件東西應談是隨便那一個國家都有的，都川的，以及「水」在客車裏的預備方法和器　總該是早就被墩路當局或者他們屬下的人員們所敦熟知的，這當然無須乎金洋盟友的發明。然而現在京滬綫的客車，在三四等那一輛有水，在一二等幾乎大半沒有水，所以雖然車箱的兩頭都有那末灰黑兒的一個小洗手盆和一個似乎半法　半點羣小「龍頭」。但是很難找得一勺的廉泉來洗于洗旅客們手掌上的灰興汗的混和物，或者洗一洗因爲蚊子臭蟲而留在旅客們手掌上的「血漿」！</p>
<p>這不妨說是車上的疎忽，然而他們的不疎忽之處却另有所寄。臀如任何客車裏的電燈罷，他們絕不忘却省儉，所以電燈少得使旅客們在夜裏只能辨別手上有幾個指簡兒，而臥車裏却輝煌得如同自　。又如飯食罷，他們絕不忘却盡力提高，所以飯食昂貴得比上海任何飯館來得高，而分量則比上海任何飯館來得少，大量他們的計劃只在乎教旅客　空，而不在乎教旅客腹飽——然而此種計劃的主持者，却是爲國家管理鐵路的公僕！也許這都不是和國民健康有關的龍，在這些公僕們的算　上面！</p>
<p>增加的理由</p>
<p>最近還有另一件出自於他們的算盤上面的事，那眞是更其教人無法明自的，六月十七日京滬各報多登出「鐵路將增價百分之二百」的消息，而此增加的理由則是：</p>
<p>邊數月來，銀路郵政兩局開支日增，虧累日五，兩路（京滬，滬杭）局四月份收入約二百六十二億元，支出約三百二十一億元，致不數約五十九億有奇，而五月份虧累尙不止此數，故增價一節已屬必然之事。</p>
<p>我們略略拿起我們旅客的算盤一敲，就發現這種增加一經實行，那末屬於收入的二百六十二億之數，不難立即變爲七百八十六億，換句話說，就是「化一爲三」，但是那筆屬入支出的三百二十一億，則不知在鐵路局的公僕們的算　上究電可以是多少！我想，在通用的一般計算方法，當然應以物價指數爲計算增减的基礎，鐵路的特別計算方法的基礎自非我們旅客所能揣度，不過就一般物價而言，若以現實的增價所收入的三倍，去抵償支出不數之數是顯然紳乎有餘的，滬樣又何必一下就增加到百分之二百的價格呢！</p>
<p>所以「加價已屬必然」云云，不免又是鐵路當局的「肚皮經」而已，雖然不必馬上就　之爲對旅客們確槌槌！</p>
<p>我以火車人的經騐閉目一思：這兩三個月以來鐵路當局對社會上所宣揚的「肚皮經」實在不少！</p>
<p>卅六年六月十八日在南京寫。</p>

<h3>「劍膽琴心」</h3>
<p>— 史鳳</p>
<p>假如你是一個小提琴或古典音藥的愛好者的話，美琪現正在上映的「劍膽琴心」，我相信會給你絕大的滿足。你可以仔細地去欣賞它，無論是在劇本上，演技上，或音樂上。</p>
<p>「劍膽琴心」不單吿訴了我們這一個舉世聞名的提琴聖手柏格尼尼的一身奮門成名的事蹟，並且還深深地指出了偉大眞誠的愛情，不是金錢和地位所能强求的，它是一種永生不滅的信心和靈感永遠地生長在愛田之中。柏氏的一身，如果沒有遇到他的愛人琴妮，他在琴　上的成就，也許沒有今日的那樣燦爛煇煌。當然他的經理人吉密的鼓勵和輔助，也是促使他成功的原因之一；可是使他鼓起勇氣發奮於演奏的，恐怕祇有琴妮一人。爲了她郝眞誠　密的愛，他可以犧性一切地去和他的情敵——保羅去決鬥，雖然他是一個不會聲劍的人，但愛情之火猛烈地燃燒在他的心頭，使他勇敢地去爲他的命運作孤注一擲！</p>
<p>史都華葛萊傑，這曾演過「情海血淚」的英俊男主角，把柏格尼尼的剛愎，果敢，熱情的性格，表演得深刻極了。許多提琴演奏塲面，都以優美的姿態表演出來。他的面部表情，刻劃出他內心不同的情感的流露，無論是悲憤，痛恨，和熱情。至於演琴妮的斐莉絲卡佛，在演技上也是同樣批獲得了成功。許多觀衆，我相信都會因她那擾越的演技而感動。她把琴妮對柏氏暗中早已種下的愛苗一口爆發時的那種無限的歡樂和熱情，表演得非常的眞誠和深刻。後來，常他在殘酷的命運支配下，她不得不去向柏氏吿別。當那　然魂消之時，她求他爲她奏一曲。於是在如訴如泣悠悠凄凉的琴聲中，她懷着無處申訴的哀怨，失望，悲痛和依戀的心情，含着滿腔熱淚，離開了柏氏！她愛他，琴擊是她的生命，她怎能離了他呵！</p>
<p>然而眞誠的愛是不械的，在梵蒂岡教庭的演奏會裏，柏氏又奏起當初別離時的一曲，琴妮再也忍不住了，她感到只有他的琴聲才能永遠地存在她的心懷，金錢和地位祇是浮雲。眞誠的愛情才是永値的。她終於又投入了柏氏的懷抱。</p>
<p>現代提琴神手郁和第孟紐恒的幕後演奏，造成了片中音藥的成功，他的技巧是値得欣賞的。</p>
<p>這是一部値得一看甚至再看的影片，我願介紹給一切愛好音樂和追求眞正愛情的人們。</p>

<p>住在上海的高等華人，感覺到游池的缺乏，到高橋去游泳似乎太遠，市內私人經登的游泳池面積旣小，取費又貴，而且人多了也不甚合乎衛生。美國各城市都有可以游泳的地方，但並不限於游泳池，多數是在溪畔，有的把岸略加堆砌，成爲游泳池的式樣。有的簡直是一秉天眞，靑靑的草和茂盛的謝木，點綴着紅綠相間的游泳衣，比人工游泳池美麗的多了。南部諸市如聖安泰尼安，奧斯汀，聖馬哥斯河道交又，對處可以游泳。當地居民擇河道比較整齊，河床比較平坦的地方，築起跳台，在岸蓋造冷飲室，就起成爲游泳池，照樣可以出售游泳票。公園裏的噴水池向例容納兒童游泳。池旣不深，無需救護人員；上海市內尙不乏公共園林，間有擅湖藻之勝者，似可就原有池塘，略加改造，使成爲游泳池，在市政當局所費無幾，而在市民健康則大有裨益。以上海人口之稠密，非有二三十處游泳池不足以應市民之需要，夏令旣近，我賢明之市政當局，有高朗之花園別墅可以避暑，不知亦嘗念及終日蜷伏擱樓及亭子十間中小民否乎？美國通例每人每次納游泳費二角五分，以黑市計之爲七八千元，以上海市民百分之一計算，收入當頗可觀，以此修繕游泳池　有餘羨，斷不致影響市政預算，海行商輸，尙有甲板游泳池，現代城市，烏可無之！（二）</p>
<h3>嵇康之死—魏晋人物雜論之一</h3>
<p>— 周冷</p>
<p>魏晋人物，史家一向以任　女虚娇情来形容他们的。然康自然也是其中之一·他那篇与山巨源绝交书，就有一段最好夫子自道：</p>
<p>「少加孤露，母兄见　，不涉经学，性復疏懒，头面常一月十五日不洗，不大悶　，不能沐也，每常小便而不忍起，今胞中略轉乃起耳。又縱逸來久，憤意傲散，簡與禮相背，懶與慢成性，而爲朋　見寬，不攻其過。」</p>
<p>到他開罪鍾會，被誣坐誅，陳壽也把他寫得有聲有色：「康將刑東市，顧視日影，紫琴彈之日：昔袁孝民常從吾學廣陵散，吾每廊固之，廣陵散於今絕失！」從生到死一直放浪絕俗，實在難兔不給人這樣批評的。</p>
<p>不過，用現代眼光看古人，好處固然因和他們距難已遠，利害得失，漠然無關，所見不會　担，持論比較公允，但壞處也正因離開他們太遠，常不能觸感到他們所處的時代，設身處地從各方加以聯想，結果不兔會隔靴搔癢，發現不出事實的眞諦。魏晋時候，有名是混亂黑暗的，半世之間，朝代兩易，上焉者一方是公然纂奪，一方却又利用各種藉口，掩飾罪行；下焉者一方是忙於爭權奪利，一方又防止別人插身其間。有良知的文人，祗好懷着一顆悲憤愴痛的心，佯狂玩世，在藥石與酒食中作自我麻醉，用「顧左右而言他」的方法，　避注意，打發這長悶漆黑的日子了。</p>
<p>抱朴子外篇時難章說得好；</p>
<p>「盡節無隱者，可爲也。若失使言必納，而身心安者，須時。時之否也，夫姦兇之徒，妬所不逮，擁上抑下，惡直醜正，憂畏公方之彈擊邪枉，是以務除勝已，以紓其殊。……令戲畏生之術者，反獲立死之罪，進安上之計者，旋受危身之　，故日，非言之難也，談之　難也。」</p>
<p>康傳說：「王戎自言與　居山陽二十年，未嘗見其喜慍之色。」看來　康早就留心自已的修養了，可惜修養得不够程度，以「何所見而來？何所見而去？」得罪了權貴，落得了個斬刑。</p>
<p>竹林七子稽康是橫死的的一關，講荒異，開罪別人，阮籍比他還利害，講不　，任性所適，劉伶他們也不見得落後，爲什麼專制的刀斧，偏偏落在他頸上呢？照筆者推想，恐怕還是他沒有後台老屬的原故。嵇康傳說；「初康居貧，　與向秀共鍛大樹之下，以自瞻給，」自然繼，欺人總是探好欺負的先下手，劉伶他們沒有他的這麼大名氣，阮籍却有個大將軍在背復　腰；他旣沒有特殊關係，却不肯買別人的　，結果，自然是死定了。</p>
<p>晋書卷四九　康傳：</p>
<p>「康於山中遇隱者孫登，登日：子才多議寡，難免乎今之世！及遭呂安事，爲　自貴曰：欲寡其過，謗議沸騰，性不傷物，頻招怨憎，昔　柳下，今愧孫登，內疚宿心，外負良朋！」</p>
<p>其實，孫登所指川的也並不見得究全而叔夜本身，也歡隱約吐當吧了。</p>
<p>想清高，想放　，也應該有些資本才得呵！</p>

<h3>The Northeast War Situation Has Tended Towards Stability, With National Forces Approaching Gongzhuling From Two Directions, Changtu Recaptured, and Communist Forces Moving West From Siping</h3>
<p>[Report from our Shenyang Office, 24th] The Northeast war situation, due to the National Army's offensive and steadfast defense of Siping, though the crisis still exists, has indeed tended towards stability. First, Benxi was recovered, reducing the tension in Guanyang. Then came Changchun and Tieling, with the National Army advancing from both the north and south towards Kaiyuan, creating a significant impact. Especially the southern route, with a large number of fresh troops bypassing Changtu and heading north at forced speed, is notable. The Communist forces have withdrawn a portion of their besieging forces from Siping, attacking north and south. On the night of the 23rd, there was only partial contact in Siping. By 9:00 AM on the 24th, the main force of the Communist troops besieging Siping had moved towards Bamiancheng. Furthermore, according to air force reconnaissance, there are still two or three strongholds on the northern side of the railway's west side that are firmly held by the National Army. It is reported that the Communist forces' siege of Siping has lasted for 14 days. Chen Mingren and Liu Handong, leading military and government personnel with the spirit of success or death, have defended the city with great determination, coupled with the strong support of the air force, creating the victory of preventing the Communist forces from diverting troops to Changchun and Shenyang. The general public has expressed great admiration. However, the tragic deaths of Communist soldiers and civilians, and the fact that Siping has become a pile of rubble, also breaks people's hearts. The National Army in southern Liaoning is carrying out mopping-up operations around the recovered strongholds. A warship has arrived outside the port of Yingkou, and more warships are expected to arrive, which is quite comforting to the people of Northeast China.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] A Shenyang dispatch states: The defending troops in Siping Street eliminated 3,000 Communist soldiers in street fighting, capturing 1,000 rifles and 500 light and heavy machine guns. The Chinese Communist radio broadcast did not acknowledge this news, and continues to claim repeated victories in Siping Street in recent days. On the night of the 22nd, the battle was most intense, with the city ablaze with fire. Government aircraft were very active, conducting as many as 130 bombing sorties throughout the day and night. At the same time, transport planes dropped a large amount of supplies to the defending troops in Siping Street, Changchun, and Jilin.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 24th] The National Army north of Kaiyuan is advancing rapidly towards Gongzhuling. The northern National Army arrived at Taojiatun (north of Gongzhuling) on the 22nd. These two National Army forces have launched a pincer attack on Gongzhuling.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 24th] There are no Communist forces on the Shenyang-Yingkou line. Passenger buses on the China Chang Railway are scheduled to run south to Waishiqiao and Yingkou, and north to Kaiyuan, starting on the 25th. The National Army reinforcing Siping recaptured Changtu on the afternoon of the 24th. The southward force has advanced to the outskirts of Gongzhuling.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 24th] The railway between Xiyang and Shuanghezhen on the Jilin-Shenyang line has been repaired and will be tested today.</p>
<p>[Report from our Shenyang Office, 24th] Although the Communist forces have besieged Chaoyang, causing tension, military officials say there is no cause for concern.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengde, 24th] Communist forces moving south from Chifeng attacked Lingyuan and Yebaishou. Another unit of about 3,000 men attacked Chaoyang again on the evening of the 22nd, with fierce fighting lasting all night. On the morning of the 23rd, the railway station (three miles north of the city) was captured. The defending troops retreated to the urban area and mountain strongholds south of the city. The battle is still continuing.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of the Constitutional Government Promotion Association, Chief of Staff Chen Reports on Military Affairs, Current Situation is Even Worse Than the "May Third" Incident</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 24th] Chief of the General Staff of the Ministry of National Defense, Chen Cheng, reported on the recent military situation on various battlefields at a joint meeting of the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association at 9:00 AM on the 24th. His conclusion stated: If military orders and government orders are properly coordinated, the military end can be expedited. He reviewed three facts that prove the Communist forces will inevitably be defeated: (1) The Communist forces are hated by the general public and can be said to have lost popular support, which will inevitably lead to defeat. (2) The morale of the Communist forces has begun to waver, as evidenced by the surrender of more than 130,000 people. (3) Material resources are scarce, so the Communist forces cannot sustain themselves for long and will eventually fail. In answering questions from committee members, Chen also stated: The current war has in fact entered the stage of international war, especially the Northeast battlefield and the Xinjiang incident, which make people deeply feel that there is a danger of falling into the repetition of the "May Third" Massacre of the 17th year of the Republic of China, and even more so. However, the "May Third" Jinan Massacre failed to stop the Northern Expedition, and now our confidence is even stronger, and we will also be able to overcome all difficulties.</p>
<p>Chen stated regarding the general situation: Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in August of the previous year, the government has adhered to a peaceful policy in order to seek a solution to the Communist problem. However, the Communist forces took the opportunity to expand their territory and develop their military strength. Local areas in the Northeast fell into the hands of the Communist forces. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the Communist forces had about three divisions. During the Anti-Japanese War, up to the 31st year, they requested to be reorganized into nine divisions. After the Anti-Japanese War, they requested to be reorganized into eighteen divisions. In October of the 34th year, Mao Zedong went to Chongqing and requested to be reorganized into forty-eight divisions. This proves that their military strength has been continuously expanding. By last year, they had expanded to 850,000 people. The government felt quite dangerous in terms of military strength. We suffered a great deal during this period. After July of last year, the government began to counterattack, driving the Communist forces in northern Jiangsu's Suqian to the north of the Longhai Railway, and continued to capture Zhangjiakou, Siping Street, and Changchun. After the Chinese Communist Party rejected peace talks this year, the government was forced to take the initiative. This stage can be called the critical moment of the Communist forces' survival. The Communist forces took advantage of the Moscow Conference to issue the order "everything for military affairs, everything for victory." In the past six months, we have defeated the Communist forces five times. Now the Communist forces are launching a second large-scale attack against us. After five defeats, the Communist forces quickly recovered their strength and counterattacked us. This is all due to international forces, which deserves attention. In this Northeast war, there are indeed Soviet troops, Korean communists, and Japanese prisoners of war participating in the fighting. To this day, we are still in a passive position.</p>
<p>In northern Shaanxi, although we occupied their old nest of Yan'an, the Communist forces fleeing in the Shaanxi-Gansu border area have not yet been eliminated.</p>
<p>In Shandong, after driving the Communist forces in northern Jiangsu to the north of the Longhai Railway last year, we further occupied the area from Linyi to Lanfeng in February of this year. However, due to insufficient transportation and transportation difficulties, progress has not been as ideal. The 74th Division unfortunately sacrificed heroically. So far, we have not completely resolved the Communist forces in Shandong, which is really due to transportation difficulties. Road repairs are currently underway to facilitate military transportation.</p>
<p>Regarding the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, the National Army is reinforcing various strongholds south of Tianjin. The Communist forces' operational goal in the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is to coordinate with the Northeast war. In Henan, the Communist forces of Liu Bocheng's troops no longer have the strength to attack again. As for the Shanxi war, after the National Army reinforced from southern Jin, the war situation has tended towards stability. Taiyuan was tense for a while, but it is now believed that there is no problem.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Chen stated: Although the war situation in various places is quite tense, it can be believed that victory will inevitably belong to us.</p>
<p>Following Chief of Staff Chen's report, Hou Teng, Acting Director of the Second Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, and Li Shuzheng, Director of the Second Division of the Third Bureau, reported on the military situation in various battlefields, briefly stating: There are more than 800,000 main Communist forces inside the Pass, of which 600,000 are trained and 200,000 are local troops. There are 520,000 in the Northeast, including 290,000 Chinese Communists, 100,000 Korean Communists, 100,000 Japanese prisoners of war, 20,000 East Mongolian Autonomous Army soldiers, and 42 Soviet advisors (31 in Gangou, north of Jilin, and 11 in Herde, east of Siping Street). There are 200,000 Communist forces in Shandong, commanded by Ye Jianying, with Soviet ships transporting soldiers and using UNRRA relief ships to transport ammunition. The battles in the Pinghan and Tianjin-Pukou Railway's northern sections are aimed at disrupting our public security in Beiping and Tianjin to prevent us from reinforcing the Northeast. The Communist forces in the Northeast are attempting to sabotage transportation in Rehe and eastern Hebei. There are more than 30,000 Communist forces in southern Jin, commanded by Chen Yi, and more than 30,000 in northern Jin, commanded by He Long. There are 50,000 in northern Shaanxi, commanded by Peng Dehuai. Currently, the larger battlefields in the country are in three places: the Northeast, Shandong, and northern Shaanxi. In the Northeast, Siping Street is under fierce battle. The area east of the China Chang Railway is in the hands of the National Army, while the area west is occupied by the Communist forces. The National Army is now attacking from the north and south of Changchun and Shenyang, and the strength of the Communist forces has been greatly reduced. There is no major war in Shandong. It is reported that a decisive battle will begin south of the Jiaoji Railway. In northern Shaanxi, since the National Army recovered Yan'an, the main force of the Communist forces has been exhausted. The National Army is still pursuing, and there may be a decisive battle. If the western route wins, the Communist forces will be easily resolved. Regarding the Beitashan incident, because aircraft with Soviet markings protected the invasion of Outer Mongolian troops, it is definitely not an ordinary border dispute. Our army has obtained many medals and documents in the battle, and has shot down one of the aircraft, which is currently being thoroughly studied.</p>
<p>Li also described his impressions of the battles over the past year, saying: It is not difficult for discerning people to understand the subtle factors behind the failure to unify the Northeast and the failure to smoothly take over Dalian and Lushun. Soldiers have the determination to defend the territory, and at the same time, they must cooperate with diplomacy and politics.</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 24th] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng invited Leighton Stuart, the head of the U.S. military advisory group, to meet at around 4:00 PM on the 24th to discuss matters.</p>
<h3>National Army Enters Tangguantun, Continues to Advance on the Tianjin-Salt Highway, Communist Forces Launch Unsuccessful Night Attack on Baoding Outskirts</h3>
<p>[Report from our Beiping Office, 24th] The military announced: After the National Army's deployment in the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway was completed and began to move south, Chenguantun was recovered on the afternoon of the 23rd, and Tangguantun was recovered at 6:00 AM on the 24th. The Communist forces in that area appear to be fleeing west.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 24th] On the Tianjin-Salt Highway, the National Army has firmly occupied Machang, Zhaozong Bridge, and Huihuo Bridge on both sides of the Jian River, cooperating with the advance of the National Army on the front.</p>
<p>[Report from our Beiping Office, 24th] There was fierce fighting near Guye on the Beining Railway last night. The railway was damaged, and all the power lines east of Tangshan were destroyed, so the details are unknown. Five places between Yangcun and Beicang on the Beiping-Tianjin section were damaged last night, and traffic was restored before noon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 24th] The northern and southern Daran areas on the outskirts of Baoding were attacked by Communist forces overnight. However, because the National Army's defenses were strong, they ultimately failed. At around 1:00 AM on the night of the 23rd, the Communist forces again gathered more than 1,000 people from the Qingyuan Brigade of the 79th Division and other units, and attacked Gouzhatou northwest of Baoding, launching a fierce attack with mortars and machine guns. They were repelled by the National Army before dawn and retreated along the original route.</p>
<h3>Dong Yanping and Shangguan Yunxiang Left Beiping Yesterday, Returning Separately to Shenyang and Tianjin</h3>
<p>[Report from our Beiping Office, 24th] For the military liaison and consultation matters between North China and the Northeast, Dong Yanping and Shangguan Yunxiang returned separately to Shenyang and Tianjin on the 24th. Dong Yanping said before leaving: The National Army will never give up the Northeast. The reinforcement troops from various routes are continuing to increase. All the major strongholds that have been lost can be gradually recovered.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 24th] Shangguan Yunxiang, Deputy Director of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters, returned to Tianjin by special train at 5:40 PM on the 24th.</p>
<h3>The Border Between Mongolia and Xinjiang Has Been Demarcated, The Beitashan Incident Is Not a Border Dispute, A Certain Government Leader Declared to Reporters</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] According to a certain responsible leader of the government here, in response to the outside world's misunderstanding that the Outer Mongolian invasion of Xinjiang was caused by a border dispute between Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang, he sternly refuted it. The responsible person stated that China attaches importance to the will of the Outer Mongolian people based on the principle of national self-determination and recognizes its independent government, and has no reason to renege. However, Outer Mongolia was originally a special administrative region of our country, belonging to the Chinese territory. According to central regulations, local governments have no right to demarcate the boundaries of administrative units, except for the central government. And according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the border after its independence should be the original border. Therefore, in law, its border can only be based on what the Chinese government had previously determined (see the map of the Ministry of Interior). Therefore, the saying that the Beitashan incident originated from a border dispute is a distortion of the facts and is very obvious.</p>
<h3>The Report on the Inspection of Dalian and Lushun Will Be Announced Soon</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 24th] The report submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Dalian and Lushun inspection team is expected to be announced soon, but the date is not yet determined.</p>
<h3>Four Committees of the Constitutional Government Promotion Association Held a Joint Meeting</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The third joint meeting of the research, investigation, propaganda, and standing committees of the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association was held at 9:00 AM on the 24th in the meeting room on the second floor of the National Assembly Hall. After Chairman Sun Ke announced the meeting this morning, he invited Chief of Staff Chen Cheng to report on military affairs. The chairman then invited Peng Zhaoxian, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Interior, to report on internal affairs. Peng explained the establishment of public opinion organs, election regulations, autonomy regulations, and the protection of human rights. The meeting continued at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, chaired by Vice Chairman Xu Fulin, to discuss proposals and pass the rules of procedure for the meeting. The government was also requested to strengthen local armed forces. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM. At 9:00 PM in the evening, a slide show on constitutional government was shown in the National Assembly Hall to entertain the committee members.</p>
<h3>Leighton Stuart's Birthday</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 24th] U.S. Ambassador to China, Leighton Stuart, joyfully celebrated his 71st birthday today. Envoys from various countries, our leaders, and people from all walks of life came to congratulate him. The ambassador's residence was decorated in an antique style. Although many of the ladies who came to congratulate him had a Western atmosphere, the huge "Search" character and the script of the Queen Mother of the West, as well as longevity peaches and birthday cakes, coupled with the burning red candles, were full of Eastern sentiment. The ambassador, wearing a white suit, greeted the guests with a very pleasant and kind expression. This situation was just like the East-West combined family when the ambassador was born on the banks of West Lake seventy years ago. Chairman Chiang and his wife held a birthday banquet for the ambassador at the residence at 8:00 PM. The alumni of Yenching University in Beijing held a celebration tea party at 4:00 PM. The ambassador received a fine ivory carving from President Zhang Qun and an ancient porcelain vase from Minister Zhang Lisheng today. These treasures are all the ambassador's favorite decorations.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Currency Reform is Currently Collecting Materials</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 24th] The Economic Reform Plan proposed by President Zhang will be discussed at the fifth meeting of the National Economic Commission on the 26th. Regarding the issue of currency reform, the committee appointed Yu Hongjun and Zhang Jia'ao to conduct research and collect materials.</p>
<h3>The Order for the Transfer of Lin Wei and Huang Zhenqiu Will Be Issued Soon</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 24th] Lin Wei, Vice Minister of National Defense, will be transferred with Huang Zhenqiu, Vice Chief of Staff. The order will be issued soon. Huang was originally the Commander of the Aid and Assistance Headquarters. At the end of last month, he was transferred with Guo Chan to become Vice Chief of Staff. Now he is transferred to Vice Minister of National Defense.</p>
<h3>Chiang Ching-kuo Flew to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Report from our Beiping Office, 24th] Chiang Ching-kuo left Beiping and flew to Nanjing on the morning of the 24th.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Talks About Sino-Japanese Relations, Advocating the Early Signing of a Peace Treaty With Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 23rd] Vice President Sun Ke recently issued a statement saying: China should prepare to sign a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible, to ensure that Japan will never again become an aggressor and to help promote permanent peace and stability in the East. Regarding the future relationship between China and Japan, in my personal opinion, China should not blame Japan for its past and should not harbor revenge. It should cooperate with the United States, Britain, and other allies to help Japan restore its legitimate position in the international community. Asia's greatest crisis today is the Communist Party's attempt to undermine economic recovery. Japan should become one of the barriers to contain the expansion of red totalitarianism. This does not mean that Japan should not be punished for its past crimes, but rather that Japan should be given the opportunity to revive militarism. Instead, it should promote Japan to atone for its past mistakes and express its intention for international peace and cooperation through action. China should prepare to fully restore commercial relations with Japan, and if possible, it may be done before signing a peace treaty, because all countries need the goods that other countries can supply. However, we should not over-trust the current reform trends in Japan. The world should know that Japanese militarism has a long history of barbarism, so it must be carefully prevented and thoroughly eradicated. In short, General MacArthur has now fulfilled his excellent work of controlling Japan. His firm determination, eradicating Japanese militarism and ultra-nationalism, and influencing the Japanese people with Christian doctrines have set an example for all victorious nations.</p>
<h3>Regarding Trade Policy With Japan, We Should Focus on Exports, The Conclusion Obtained by Tang, Commercial Commissioner</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] After Japan resumed private international trade on August 15 this year, China's trade policy with Japan, which urgently needs supplies, should focus on exports rather than imports. This is the opinion of Tang, the commercial commissioner of the Chinese delegation, and is welcomed by Japan and the Allied Headquarters. Japan is extremely short of raw materials, and China can supply to a considerable extent. A trade policy that focuses on exports can increase China's exports on the one hand, and accelerate Japan's industrial and economic recovery on the other hand. Economic progress in Japan can also reduce the cost of Allied occupation of Japan.</p>
<h3>Adjusting the Exchange Rate of Taiwan Currency, the Central Government Has Authorized Chairman Wei</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 24th] It is rumored that the Provincial Government has reached an understanding with the central government and can freely adjust the exchange rate between the Taiwan currency and the legal tender. Yan Jiagan, Director of the Finance Department, has indirectly confirmed this. It is said that many Taiwanese hope that the value of the Taiwan currency will be increased to isolate external financial fluctuations. The central government has indeed granted Chairman Wei greater authority over adjusting the exchange rate of the Taiwan currency.</p>
<h3>Pay Raises for Military Personnel Will Be Paid Retroactively From May</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 24th] Pay raises for military personnel were previously decided by the Executive Yuan, but have not yet been implemented. It is now learned that the pay raise method has been re-decided. Officers, regardless of general, colonel, or lieutenant rank, will receive a 40% increase across the board. Soldiers will receive at least double the increase. It will be officially announced and implemented in the short term, and will be paid retroactively from May of this year.</p>
<h3>Overseas Members of the Democratic Socialist Party Concerned About Internal Disputes, Telegraph Wu Xianzifu to Continue Mediation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Wu Xianzifu met with reporters yesterday and said: He recently received a telegram from New York stating that members of the Democratic Socialist Party in the Americas held an informal meeting in New York on the 19th and 20th of this month and decided to ask Wu to continue mediating the internal disputes of the Democratic Socialist Party, and declared four positions: (1) The previous Party Group Committee did not have a quorum and should be reopened. (2) The overseas delegates of 26 people should be recognized. (3) Sun Baogang and others' attack on the party chairman is not a major crime and should not be expelled, but the Reform Committee should also stop its activities. (4) After the two parties in the dispute restore their relationship, a general assembly of delegates will be convened. Wu also stated: This telegram will be sent to Mr. Zhang immediately. If Mr. Zhang agrees, mediation will begin.</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 24th] Xu Fulin left Nanjing by night train on the 24th and will go to Shanghai on the 26th to preside over the establishment ceremony of the Guangdong Provincial Party Department of the Democratic Socialist Party. Xu is currently also serving as a legislator in the Guangdong Provincial Party Department. Xu will return to Nanjing before July 4th after finishing his business.</p>
<h3>The Sino-French Civil Aviation Agreement is Extended, The French Note Has Been Delivered, We Are Also Borrowing Money From Canada to Build Aviation</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 24th] The French note regarding the extension of the Sino-French Civil Aviation Agreement to the end of this year has been delivered. It is expected to be submitted at the next political meeting and the exchange of notes will be approved. The key points are two: (1) The extension is for six months until the end of this year. (2) Previously, aircraft from both countries had to return to their place of origin after flying to their destination. Now, this restriction is lifted. French aircraft can fly to Japan, Hong Kong, or other places that do not belong to China after flying from Hanoi to Shanghai. Our aircraft can also fly to India, Europe, and other places after flying to Hanoi.</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 24th] Civil Aviation Carrier An Guo is currently in negotiations with the Canadian government for a new loan, so that the Canadian government can provide us with materials to help us engage in aviation and transportation construction.</p>
<h3>Internal Plan to Formulate Sanctions to Prevent Fraud in Universal Suffrage</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] With the general election about to begin, all parties are paying close attention to election fraud and its sanctions. Based on investigations of provincial, municipal, and county councilor elections conducted over the years, the Ministry of the Interior has listed various possible malpractices and formulated numerous sanctioning measures. The main points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Illegal Conduct by Election Organizers of Provincial, Municipal, and County Councilor Elections: The chief election authorities, local administrative officials, and local officials may, in order to manipulate public opinion or collude with candidates, fail to conduct elections in accordance with the law, in order to favor the election of a particular candidate. The situations are as follows: (1) Falsifying voter registration lists or election results. (2) Not conducting election affairs in accordance with legal procedures, such as: 1. Failing to announce the election date before the legal deadline; 2. Holding elections on illegal dates (such as holidays or Sundays); 3. Failing to hold simultaneous elections in all unit areas or groups when simultaneous elections are required; 4. Other situations.</p>
<p>Although situation (1) is rare, specific provisions should be established to clearly define its punishment. Regarding situation (2), when elections are not conducted in accordance with legal procedures, whether they should be deemed invalid or remain valid, or under what circumstances they should be considered valid and under what circumstances they should be considered invalid, should all be clearly stipulated, and how to punish those who do not conduct elections in accordance with legal procedures should also be specified.</p>
<p>(B) Ineligible Voters: There are several situations: (1) Citizens who do not belong to this area participating in the election voting in this area. (2) Persons without the qualifications of vocational group members participating in vocational group elections. (3) Impersonating others to vote. (4) A person has two or more voting rights, and according to regulations, should choose one to participate in voting but does not comply with the regulations and participates in two or more voting activities at the same time.</p>
<p>Regarding methods to prevent ineligible voters, a system of public inspection of voter registration lists should be adopted. Those who impersonate others should be regarded as criminal behavior, and in addition to stipulating imprisonment and fines, their voting rights and eligibility to be elected should be suspended for several years.

<h3>Formal Sino-American Negotiations on Wartime Debts; New Loans Under Discussion; Ambassador Gu Delivers Speech in Washington</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd] Negotiations between China and the United States on resolving wartime accounts of 2.1 billion US dollars officially began here today. The Chinese delegation, led by Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun, and the US delegation, led by Assistant Secretary of State Thorpe, held what State Department officials called an "exploratory" meeting. A State Department spokesperson said that consultations would enter a "working stage" in a few days, and said: China's wartime accounts include 1.564698 billion US dollars of Lend-Lease materials transferred to China during and after the war, a 500 million US dollar loan in 1942, unsettled wartime surplus property (valued and included in the credit loan item), totaling 35 million US dollars, and other financial debts between the two countries. The aforementioned transaction of 35 million US dollars of surplus property includes the following items transferred to China: (1) a shipyard built by the US in Shanghai, (2) a large number of trucks piled up in Calcutta, India after the victory of the war against Japan (valued at 25 million US dollars), and (3) wartime surplus materials of the US Army in Western China. The above items were not resolved in the surplus sales agreement signed on August 30 last year. This bilateral negotiation will also re-evaluate the accounts of the 500 million US dollars of surplus materials under the 900 million US dollars worth of surplus materials sold to China last August. When the State Department announced last month that it would begin negotiations, it stated that the terms of the Lend-Lease agreement negotiated with China would reflect the "same generous resolution principles" of the agreements signed by the United States with other countries (especially Britain). Britain's Lend-Lease accounts, after deducting the US's reverse Lend-Lease accounts and other debts, totaled approximately 25 billion US dollars. The result of the settlement was that only about 25 cents per dollar had to be paid. The members of the Chinese delegation participating in the negotiations included Minister Gong Shouhua, and Wang Jingchun, head of the Chinese Purchasing Delegation in the United States. The members of the US delegation included Nyes, Director of the State Department's Finance and Development Policy Division, and Lin Huaide, Director of the China Department.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 23rd] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun said on the 23rd that China may obtain a large new loan from the United States for China's post-war reconstruction. This was a statement made by Ambassador Gu after meeting with Assistant Secretary of State Thorpe, and said: This new loan is still in the exploratory stage, and the amount of the loan has not been mentioned. This loan will be short-term, and the amount will be smaller than a one-time long-term loan. Gu hoped to obtain a large long-term loan, and he found that Thorpe was very sympathetic to this matter. The main part of Gu's meeting with Thorpe concerned the issue of China repaying the Lend-Lease Act loan. The main purpose of his visit to Thorpe was to make Thorpe understand China's situation.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The US Foreign Liquidation Commission announced yesterday: According to the Sino-American Surplus Materials Agreement of August 30 last year, materials worth approximately 170 million US dollars had been transferred to China by the end of last month. These include trucks, road construction machines, clothing, food, and medicine, but aircraft, combat materials, ships, and naval equipment are not included in the transfer. The location of this batch of materials is partly in mainland China, and also in Guam, Okinawa, and various islands in the Pacific. When China and the United States established the agreement last fall, it was estimated that approximately 500 million US dollars worth of surplus materials would be transferred to China. After the agreement was signed, the Materials Supply Bureau of the Chinese Executive Yuan and the US Foreign Liquidation Commission began negotiations on how to fulfill the contract, and institutions were established and personnel were assigned at that time, and the transfer work began immediately. Six months later, the US transferred 30 million US dollars worth of materials. In March, April, and May of this year, another 13.6 million US dollars worth of materials were transferred, that is, 4.5 million US dollars worth of materials were transferred each month.</p>

<h3>Wowen Visits the Chairman and Returns to Shanghai by Car That Evening</h3>

<h3>Pan Gongzhan Expresses Opinions on the Mission of the Far East Economic Commission; Economy and Politics Should Be Discussed Together</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Municipal Council, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Local Association, National Federation of Commercial Associations, Municipal Industrial Association, Banking Association, Money Industry Association, Shipping Industry Association, Importers and Exporters Association, Cotton Textile Industry Association of the Sixth District, Flour Industry Association of the Fourth District, China Industrial and Commercial Association, National Diplomacy Association, and China International Trade Association, etc., held a cocktail reception at the International Hotel on the 14th floor from 6:00 to 8:00 PM yesterday to welcome the representatives from various countries who came to Shanghai to attend the meeting of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. It was hosted by more than a dozen people, including Chairman Pan Gongzhan, Yan Huiqing, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Zhengting, Xu Jiguang, Wu Yunchu, Tang Xinghai, Li Daonan, and Li Shuxiong. About 300 people attended, including Mayor Wu, Li Shizeng, and representatives from various countries, leaders from all walks of life, and other guests.</p>
<p>The reporter took the opportunity to ask Chairman Pan for his opinion on the meeting. Chairman Pan said: This is the first international conference held in the city since the Second World War. During the war, the losses suffered by Asia and the Far East were no less severe than those in Europe or other parts of the world, and China was the most deeply and longest ravaged by the enemy. Shanghai was the first to be destroyed at the beginning of the Far East War. The remnants of the war in Nanshi, Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong are still vivid. Speaking of the mission of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. Its ultimate goal is to help the economic reconstruction of Asian and Far Eastern countries and create a higher level of economic activity. It is firmly believed that the representatives of various countries will definitely realize the importance of their mission and the urgency of people's expectations. In today's world where politics and economy are inseparable, political stability often depends on the solution of economic problems, and economic stability also depends on political enlightenment and progress. We sincerely hope that the representatives of various countries with far-sightedness will not be satisfied with solving problems within the scope of the economy, but will also do their best to promote genuine political cooperation among all ethnic groups in the world, without any suspicion of each other, and then can seek stability in people's lives from economic recovery. As far as the Far East is concerned, Japan was originally a highly industrialized country, and its cheap goods could even extend to Europe and the United States. However, during the war, Japan's industrial equipment was not severely damaged. If the Allies do not impose reasonable controls on Japan, or even be deceived by Japan's docile disguise, and are too trusting, making the control work lax, it will make the economic recovery of other countries in Asia and the Far East difficult, or even cause the world's people to suffer from war again. Therefore, we sincerely hope that sufficient and deserved compensation will be obtained from Japan as soon as possible and preferentially to help China's economic recovery. At the same time, it is necessary to prevent all activities that can promote the resurgence of Japan's economic aggression, so that the holding of this meeting will not be in vain.</p>

<h3>Our Consul General in Saigon Warns the Viet Minh Authorities Not to Continue Destroying Overseas Chinese Property</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 24th] Chinese Consul General in Saigon Yin issued a statement today warning the Viet Minh authorities not to continue destroying overseas Chinese property, otherwise the Chinese government will reconsider its current neutral attitude. The statement said: The French-Vietnamese conflict has caused heavy losses to overseas Chinese in Vietnam. China has protested to the French authorities several times. It is regrettable that Viet Minh people have taken various destructive actions against overseas Chinese enterprises. It is incomprehensible that Annam people repay China's friendship with this attitude, as overseas Chinese property is the result of hard work. China maintains a friendly neutrality in the current conflict. I hope that the Viet Minh authorities will find a way to stop the destruction of overseas Chinese property, otherwise our government will be forced to reconsider its attitude.</p>
<h3>Luo Zhuoying Inspects Disaster Areas by Plane; Guangdong Actively Raises Funds for Disaster Relief; Zhang Fakui Appeals to Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 24th] Chairman Luo today took the main plane of the Executive Yuan Air Transport Brigade to inspect the flood-stricken areas, accompanied by a Central News Agency reporter. The special plane took off at 9:50 am, and the inspection area included the four rivers of Dong, Xi, Bei, and Han, covering more than ten counties. First, it inspected along the Dongjiang and Hanjiang rivers, landing in Shantou at 12:40 pm. At the Liaison Office, it convened a symposium of county magistrates from various Hanjiang counties, where the county magistrates reported on the disaster situation and urgent relief needs. At 3:40 pm, it took off again, flying over the Xijiang and Beijiang rivers for a low-altitude inspection, which ended at 6:37 pm. Today's inspection of the disaster areas did not cover the southern route and the areas above Qingyuan on the Beijiang River. Overall, the disaster situation is more serious in the Xijiang River and lighter in the Hanjiang River. Although the disaster has gradually subsided in recent days, most of the rice fields are still submerged in floodwaters, and even those that have emerged from the water have withered. The early rice harvest is feared to be hopeless. Because their houses have been flooded, many disaster victims are gathering on high ground, urgently awaiting relief.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 24th] As the flood situation in Guangdong Province worsens, people from all walks of life in the provincial capital are doing everything possible to raise funds and distribute them to the disaster areas for relief. Zhang Fakui, Director of the Executive Headquarters, made a special broadcast to overseas Chinese, appealing for assistance to the flood-stricken compatriots. Officers and soldiers of the Executive Headquarters are voluntarily cutting back on one meal and donating one day's earnings, and workers throughout the city have also decided to donate one day's labor earnings to benefit the disaster-stricken people. Five theaters here are putting on a charity performance tonight to raise funds, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is also dispatching teams to raise funds. Furthermore, Hong Kong's concern for the disaster-stricken compatriots is no less than that here. The relief funds raised have reached HK$250,000 to date. Yesterday, representatives were sent here to discuss relief distribution methods and to establish a disaster relief liaison office here.</p>
<h3>Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau Reports that the Flood Situation is Slightly Stable</h3>
<p>More Rains in Store, Floodwaters Will Follow</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 24th] Yang Huarui, Director of the Pearl River Water Conservancy Bureau, recently received reporters and reported that the flood situation in the four rivers of Guangdong Province has been slightly stable to date. Due to the impact of heavy rains, this year's flood season arrived a month early. Compared with historical records, the water level of the Dongjiang River exceeded half a meter, the Beijiang River was only 1.2 meters short, the Xijiang River was 0.97 meters short, and the Hanjiang River was also higher than in previous years, resulting in the collapse of dozens of embankments in various places. It is estimated that the loss of submerged rice fields amounts to 1.05 million mu, or 1.5 million dan, with a market value of 300 billion yuan. The loss of other property is even more difficult to estimate. The Water Conservancy Bureau has now dispatched 120 engineering personnel to the four rivers to step up the rescue of embankments and assist in building autumn dams after the flood recedes to protect the late rice crop. The occurrence of this flood seems to be overdue from the major flood of 30 years ago. There are still more than 90 days until the major flood season, and floodwaters will inevitably follow. Therefore, in addition to the Bureau's full assistance, local officials and people must also work together to inspect and rescue the embankment. Otherwise, the disaster will be even more difficult to predict. Furthermore, the weather here has cleared up in recent days, and the floodwaters that have entered the urban area have receded by two or three feet. Traffic outside the city has also gradually resumed. The Guangdong-Hankou and Guangzhou lines have been opened to traffic. It is hoped that Guangzhou will be spared from the flood.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan's Toupeng Township is About to Sink; Shen Honglie Goes to Inspect</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 24th] Recently, the tides have been strong, and the collapse of the Nansha embankment in Xiaoshan is intensifying. Toupeng Township is about to sink. All parties are urgently calling for rescue. The Embankment Works Bureau, due to the local government's inability to bear the expenses, has allocated flour for wages and dispatched personnel to design rescue measures, but it has been unable to start construction. Chairman Shen, in order to understand the actual situation of the embankment collapse, made a special trip to Nansha today for inspection. He expressed great concern for the local residents and offered consolation. Also: Chairman Shen, in order to understand the water conservancy projects in the counties under Lake Tai, will personally inspect them tomorrow for a period of one week.</p>
<h3>Far East Military Tribunal Adjourns; Mei Ru'ao and Others Return Home Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] Mei Ru'ao, Judge of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, and Xiang Zhexun, Prosecutor, will return home for duty during the adjournment of the tribunal. Both will return here in late July or early August to attend the war trial. Xiang said: If time permits, he hopes to go to Guangxi to collect evidence to accuse former Prime Minister Hideki Tojo and his 24 defendants.</p>
<p>[Our City News] Mei Ru'ao and Xiang Zhexun are scheduled to take an American plane from Tokyo to Shanghai on the morning of the 25th, arriving at Jiangwan Airport around 4 pm. Both will then proceed to Nanjing to report to the central government.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Command Post Sends Troops to Suppress Bandit Gangs in Northeast Tang</h3>

<h3>Wei Daoming Reports on Administration at the Taiwan Provincial Assembly, and Answers Questions on the Popular Election of County and City Mayors</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 24th] Wei Daoming attended the Taiwan Provincial Assembly this morning and stated in his general administrative report: "The 'February 28th' incident was truly a heartbreaking event. I hope that the unfinished matters of this case will be concluded as soon as possible. In addition to allowing self-renewal for those who blindly followed, I am also separately considering the names of the 30 principal offenders transferred by the previous administration. Those with lighter circumstances will also be given the opportunity for self-renewal. In fact, two of them have already been granted self-renewal, and many others will also be granted self-renewal. Those with more serious circumstances will still be handed over to the court for handling. I believe that the court will also follow the central government's policy of leniency and conduct lenient trials." Councilor Han Yuquan raised an oral inquiry stating: "Chief Executive Chen once promised that popular elections for county and city mayors would be implemented on July 1st. Minister Bai Chongxi also mentioned this matter. Has the Provincial Government made preparations? Furthermore, the qualifications for county and city mayoral candidates stipulated by the central government are not very applicable to the special circumstances of the province. How will Chairman Wei handle this matter?" Wei replied: "If the central government promulgates the law for popular elections of county and city mayors in the future, it will be implemented immediately. The issue of qualifications for county and city mayoral candidates is indeed very important. The situation in Taiwan Province is slightly different.

<p>The Two Tax Bureaus Refuse to Attend and Report</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 24th] Two fierce interpellations occurred during the fourth general meeting of the Wuhan Municipal Assembly this morning.

<h3>Understand China! Recognize the Far East! ... Welcome to the Visit of American Media Magnates to China</h3>
<p>Howard, an American media magnate, and Mayor Lapham of San Francisco, along with a group of 21 people, flew to Shanghai yesterday afternoon from Manila on a Pan American Airlines Constellation "America Clipper" for a round-the-world flight. They immediately switched to a China National Aviation Corporation plane to fly to our national capital to pay their respects to Chairman Chiang and attend a banquet hosted by President Zhang. They then flew back to Shanghai last night. After staying for a day or two, they will take the original plane tomorrow morning to cross the Pacific Ocean and return home. At a time when the international community is full of suspicion and the world is in danger of splitting, the 21 American media magnates are making a bold move to travel around the world, which will not only make a significant contribution to promoting international understanding and thus creating world peace, but also have profound significance for the United States to understand China and recognize the Far East. In addition to expressing our sincere welcome, we also have unlimited hopes for the visit of Mr. Howard and his colleagues, at least hoping that they can bring back to the United States the views of the Chinese people on the world, especially on the United States, report to the whole country, so that the American people can fully understand China and truly recognize the Far East, and then consider the China policy that they should adopt.</p>
<p>First, the basic attitude of the Chinese people towards the post-war world, in a word, is to hope that there can be genuine understanding among nations, to seek cooperation from understanding, and to seek world peace from international cooperation. This basic attitude is completely in line with the spirit of the United Nations Charter. Chinese representatives attend any international conference, and this basic attitude is the starting point. They have more confidence in the ideals sought by the United Nations organization. It is certainly necessary to feel that China is in a position of being between the two major powers of the world if you look at China's foreign policy with colored glasses. But if we can speak fairly, China's foreign policy can be said to be very balanced. In addition to faithfully fulfilling its international treaty obligations, it also strives to live in peace with all friendly nations and seek the progress and happiness of mankind through international cooperation. Even with regard to the United States and the Soviet Union, the position adopted by our country is the same for all, without any distinction between "friend," "enemy," "kin," or "distant." Because China is inherently insufficient and has been disoriented. Before the war, China was invaded by the political, economic and cultural aspects of various imperialist countries, and had already fallen into a semi-colonial position. Although it is said that China is an agricultural country based on agriculture, the farmers across the country adhere to the old ways and stick to the old ways, resulting in the bankruptcy of the countryside. Taking only food as an example, every year they still have to rely on foreign countries to import foreign rice and flour. As for industry and commerce, they are in a slump and are completely an industrially backward country. Until the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the danger of the country was increasingly felt. Fortunately, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the whole country finally won the final victory in the military under the common belief of "victory in the War of Resistance and success in national construction." But economically, the whole country suffered heavy damage after eight years of destruction, and was almost full of devastation. Naturally, it needs to recuperate in the post-war period so that it can restore its vitality and then embark on the road of national construction and revitalization. It not only needs international peace, but also needs the economic and material assistance of the great powers. Only under these conditions can China bury itself in national construction to build a peaceful, unified, democratic and powerful country. Therefore, after the victory of the War of Resistance, the Chinese government did not hesitate to make major sacrifices and signed a treaty of friendship and alliance with the Soviet Union. Even at present, the Chinese government's attitude towards the Soviet Union is still very cautious and careful, and it still hopes that the Soviet Union can abide by the spirit of the Sino-Soviet alliance treaty. In recent weeks, the relationship between China and the Soviet Union has undergone new brewing due to the invasion of Outer Mongolia into Xinjiang and the evolution of the Northeast War into an international problem, and the situation in the Far East has suddenly become tense. We must tell Mr. Howard and his colleagues that the evolution of this situation should be entirely the responsibility of the Soviet Union, as long as the Soviet Union can abide by the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, not only can all previous problems be easily solved, but it is not impossible for China and the Soviet Union to maintain a friendly and cooperative relationship.</p>
<p>Second, with regard to the friendship between China and the United States, we first hope that Mr. Howard and his colleagues will have more time in the future to observe the Chinese people's views on the United States at leisure and on the spot, so as to fully understand China and truly recognize the Far East. We always feel that American "China experts" are inevitably superficial in their understanding of China, and they often cannot touch the core of any problem, so the conclusions they draw are inevitably frivolous. For example, the Shanghai English-language "Da Mei Evening News" once published an editorial "Who Gave Up Whom?" which misunderstood China's desire for American aid as purely motivated by selfishness. Also, the United Press reporter Rundall also reported that the reason why the US Export-Import Bank refused to release the $500 million loan that had been saved for a long time was that China had abused US loans in the past and that China's current policies discriminate against American interests in China. These two points may seem reasonable to the American government and the public, but in our opinion, they are unnecessary distortions of the facts. China urgently needs American economic assistance, which is formed by the objective situation of the world's general situation. To be honest, China would never want to borrow money from the United States unless it was necessary. After the loan is obtained, it will not be used arbitrarily. As for the Chinese government's discrimination against American interests in China, it is even more unnecessary to explain. Hasn't the Sino-American Commercial Treaty already been signed? Isn't the spirit of the Commercial Treaty completely based on equality and mutual benefit? But China is an industrially and commercially backward country, and in fact, it is China that suffers if it is equal and mutually beneficial with the United States. Moreover, when the US Export-Import Bank refuses to release the $500 million loan that has been saved for a long time, China lacks US dollars and the United States refuses to help. How can it be mutually beneficial with the United States? It is an inevitable and reasonable measure for the Chinese government to implement import and export controls.</p>
<p>In short, "Who Gave Up Whom?" There is no need to argue any further. We hope that Mr. Howard and his colleagues, the magnates of the news media of the country of the os, can bring the feelings and thoughts of our people back to their country and tell the government and the public that we should take the above two points as the basis for re-examining our China policy. The American Far East Business Conference advocates studying the current situation in China. If it can come to China for on-the-spot investigation, we will sincerely welcome it. The friendship between China and the United States has always been friendly. After eight years of blood, it has become closer and has become a friendship in adversity. The recent shadow between China and the United States will not be difficult to disappear. However, from the standpoint of our colleagues, we still hope that American media magnates can use newspapers as a weapon to promote international relations. The lessons of the two world wars make us deeply understand that the outbreak of international wars is often caused by some misunderstandings. We must be careful to prevent problems before they arise. We hope that the news media of China and the United States, in order to promote international understanding and cooperation and to eliminate the causes of war, should make special efforts in this regard.</p>

<h3>US Senate Overturns Presidential Veto; Labor-Management Bill Becomes Law; Union Activities Will Be Restricted in the Future; Workers Across the Country Plan to Launch a General Strike to Protest</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] The labor-management bill restricting union activities, which was vetoed by President Truman, was passed by the Senate today with 68 votes against 25, maintaining the original bill. The House of Representatives had already resolved to overturn the President's veto last week, so the bill automatically became a law. The Senate vote in favor of maintaining the original bill was six votes more than the necessary two-thirds majority. Before the vote, the President sent a special letter to Democratic leader Barkley, saying that the bill was dangerous legislation and asking Democratic senators to maintain his veto. The law authorizes the government to order a halt to national emergency strikes for at least 80 days and amends certain provisions of the National Labor Relations Act to restrict union activities. Union leaders called the new bill a slave law, and national unions have sent telegrams to members of Congress, asking them to uphold the President's veto. The Republican viewpoint was summarized by Senator Taft, who said that the Republican Party was entrusted to propose this legislation when it was elected last November to adjust the balance between employers and unions. If the President could consider the will of the people and not add his personal opinion, he would be doing a service to the people. Observers believe that the passage of this new bill will lead labor-management relations into a new era, and its impact will be like the Wagner Act passed during the heyday of the New Deal. It is expected that in the first stage, labor-management disputes and lawsuits will inevitably occur to test the effectiveness of this new law, just like the situation after the Wagner Act was first passed. Many of the provisions of the new law must be interpreted and decided by the Supreme Court, especially regarding union security, the creation of damage, the responsibility of unions for strikes and violations of contracts, and the "unfair" measures taken by unions, which will inevitably be clarified by the court.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] The Taft-Hartley union control bill has already elicited a rapid reaction from labor, which will call for a general strike to protest. Union leaders are indignant that the President's veto was easily overturned by both houses of Congress and declared that they would retaliate by opposing legislators who supported the bill in the voting.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] After the US Senate overturned President Truman's veto of the labor-management bill, the response in the United States was as follows: (1) Coal miners, who were scheduled to start a vacation before the contract signed with the government expires at midnight on Friday, have already stopped early. Coal mines in Alabama, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Virginia have all stopped. According to the latest news, more than 23,000 miners have stopped working. (2) The San Francisco Labor Organization Congress has requested that its chairman, Moorey, announce a 24-hour strike to oppose the labor law. The United Steelworkers Union of 30,000 members in the Southeastern United States expects that the labor law will cause a general strike of 90 percent of organized workers. (3) Green, the chairman of the American Federation of Labor, announced that the Federation of Labor will immediately launch a campaign to abolish the law and predicted that those who supported the bill will be defeated in the 1948 election. (4) The opinions of the vice presidents of the American News Association are quite inconsistent, with some believing that it will strengthen the party's strength in 1948, and others believing that it will weaken it. (5) Wallace's American Progressive Citizens Society program stated that Truman's failure to implement his veto was the most tragic failure to realize the late President Roosevelt's plan. (6) Keyes, the chairman of the Detroitet Foremen's Association, predicted that the court would test the provisions of the new law, that is, deprive foremen of the right to negotiate. (7) Republican spokesmen warned the administration to prevent mishandling, which would lead to labor's sabotage of the law. At the same time, Van Arkel, the General Counsel of the National Labor Board, due to the feasibility of the implementation of the law, raised serious questions and resigned. (8) Shirreff, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce, said that the bill is a cornerstone in American industrial history and will help industrial peace.</p>
<h3>Although the Veto of the Labor-Management Bill Was Overturned, Truman's Prestige Increased Instead; It is Difficult to Say What Impact It Will Have on the Next Competition</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 23rd] Regarding President Truman's veto of the labor bill proposed by Republican members Taft and Hartley, it has been reported by well-informed sources that although the President's veto has been overturned, his personal prestige has increased greatly as a result. Although President Du Jingmen's views are agreed by the general public, his name has been raised because of his position, but this does not necessarily have any benefit for the Democratic Party when it runs for president in 1948. A considerable number of Democratic members of Congress who take the same line as Republican members and oppose the government, and who take a special position on labor issues, believe that the new labor bill strictly restricts union activities and will prohibit the closed shop system, which is also included, and is really undesirable.</p>
<h3>Moscow Radio Criticizes US Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 23rd] Moscow Radio issued a broadcast tonight, severely criticizing US foreign policy, believing that its purpose is to control the world with "meager monetary gifts." The commentator did not directly mention Marshall's economic aid plan for Europe, only stating that the purpose of the new US policy, Trumanism, is only to express US imperialism, to impose economic control on countries around the world, and to promote world peace and security in the name of economic relief. In fact, American imperialists want to establish and consolidate their new political and economic power.</p>

<h3>Expanding the Three-Way Foreign Ministers' Conference, Britain Plans to Invite Relevant Countries to Participate, Britain and France Welcome the Soviet Union's Acceptance of the Invitation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency London 24th] Foreign Ministry officials stated today that Bevin is scheduled to leave Britain for France on the afternoon of the 26th to attend the British, French, and Soviet negotiations on the Marshall Plan. The negotiations will begin on the 27th.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London 23rd] Regarding the upcoming meeting in Paris of the foreign ministers of Britain, the Soviet Union, and France to discuss the plan for economic aid to Europe proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Marshall, sources here said that Britain may expand the three-way foreign ministers' meeting and invite all relevant countries to participate. When determining the needs of Europe, Britain will seek a common solution for all related countries, rather than simply listing the individual needs of European countries. Britain will also ask all relevant countries to jointly provide the U.S. government with a final response. This move can prevent the Soviet Union from proposing excessively large needs that are disproportionate to the needs of other countries.</p>
<p>[Reuters London 23rd] Foreign Secretary Bevin announced in the House of Commons today that the Soviet government has accepted the British and French proposal to hold a three-way meeting to discuss the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe, and the British government has also agreed to the Soviet suggestion to hold this meeting in Paris on June 27th.

Former Foreign Secretary Eden, Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party, wished the meeting rapid and definite progress. Bevin also said: He will go to Paris on Friday to immediately begin this work.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris 23rd] French Foreign Minister Bidault announced in the National Assembly today that the Soviet government has accepted the invitation of the British and French governments to participate in the three-way foreign ministers' meeting to discuss the plan for economic aid to Europe proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Marshall.

<h3>Regarding Atomic Energy Control, Stassen Expresses His Views, the United States Should Directly Negotiate with Stalin</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 24th - Stassen, a Republican presidential candidate in 1948, published an article in "Ladies' Home Journal," advocating that the United States send a delegation to directly negotiate with Stalin on the issue of atomic energy control. It is said that after his recent meeting with Stalin, he firmly believes that such a meeting would be extremely helpful. The delegation members should include Democratic and Republican senators and scientific leaders from the Atomic Energy Commission, and the meeting counterpart should be Stalin, the Soviet Politburo, and Soviet scientists.</p>
<h3>Truman Will Request Congress to Convene a Special Session This Autumn to Review the Progress of the Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington 23rd] Informed sources here said that President Truman may request Congress to convene a special session in the fall to review the development of the Marshall Plan. Everyone has become more confident in this view, given that President Truman has appointed three committees to prepare for the European economic recovery plan. Diplomatic sources also believe that this measure by the President proves that the government has the desire to fully implement the Marshall Plan, pending a basic agreement from European countries. It is reported that of the three committees to be established by the U.S. government, one will be headed by Secretary of Commerce Harriman, responsible for determining the scope of U.S. foreign aid, and the method must be wise and safe. The second will be chaired by Secretary of the Interior Krug, studying the extent to which American resources can meet European needs. The third will be chaired by Truman's chief economic advisor Nourse, studying the consequences and reactions that the implementation of this plan will cause to the national economy.</p>

<h3>Japanese Shipping Industry Actively Preparing to Resume Operations</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Tokyo 24th] Since MacArthur Headquarters announced the permission for Japan's private foreign trade to resume on August 15, all sectors in Japan have been greatly stimulated and have become very active.

<h3>The United States Will Reinstate Controls on Oil Exports Starting Next Month</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington 24th] The Department of Commerce announced last night that the U.S. government has decided to reinstate controls on oil products from the end of this month due to reduced inventories.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington 23rd] The U.S. government today reinstated wartime regulations on gasoline exports. This move was taken because members of Congress criticized the U.S. for shipping gasoline to the Soviet Union. This control does not completely stop gasoline from being shipped to the Soviet Union, but it first requires the Department of Commerce to consider and obtain a gasoline export license before it can be shipped. This measure will take effect on June 30th, 24 hours before the expiration of the Emergency Export Control Act.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington 24th] Ohio Republican Chairman Weichel announced today that the House Merchant Marine Committee received a report that the Soviet oil tankers shipping oil back to the country from the United States were built several years ago specifically for this purpose. One of them loaded 123,000 barrels of gasoline and 12,000 barrels of other oils two weeks ago and set sail from California. Two others set sail at the beginning of this month, carrying 115,000 barrels of oil, and three others are loading cargo in California ports and can leave port before the oil export controls are reinstated at the end of this month.</p>
<h3>The French Government Overcomes Difficulties, the Fiscal Reform Bill is Passed by Congress, Thousands of People Demonstrate Outside the Meeting Place</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris 24th] The French National Assembly today passed the emergency fiscal reform measures proposed by Finance Minister Schuman, with 320 votes in favor, 241 votes against, and 59 abstentions. The bill stipulates increased tax revenue to make up for the budget deficit. The Congressional Finance Committee first passed it at the second reading yesterday afternoon. It was initially rejected at the first reading last Saturday, but the decision was changed due to the government's urgent appeal.</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris 23rd] The National Assembly began today a two-day debate on a financial plan that could affect the fate of the cabinet. Prior to that, the Finance Committee of the National Assembly had overturned its previous decision and adopted the bill aimed at saving the country's fiscal crisis. While the Finance Committee was discussing, many people gathered outside to protest the financial plan. The police had been ordered to be on alert in advance, and although armored vehicles and tear gas equipment were deployed, they were not used. The demonstrators were well-behaved and no incidents occurred. Under the scorching sun, the crowd shouted "Hang Schuman (the Finance Minister who proposed the plan), the police are on our side!" The crowd gathered at various points near the Palais Bourbon, the seat of the National Assembly. The police estimated that there were 4,000 people. The demonstrators did not attempt to break into the parliament and soon dispersed.</p>
<h3>Brown Sternly Rebukes Stubborn Korean Elements, More Than 500 Groups Agree to Participate in Negotiations</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Seoul 24th] U.S. Representative Major General Brown issued a special statement today through the Public Information Department, stating that the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission is proceeding with its work according to plan, but at this juncture, disturbances by a portion of irresponsible Koreans have hindered the work of the Joint Commission. When the U.S. and the Soviet Union are doing their best for Korea, such unfortunate events have occurred, which proves that Koreans lack the ability to govern themselves. These youths who participate in demonstrations and act in a disorderly manner fully show that they only care about their personal interests and do not start from the welfare of the public. Up to now, more than 500 groups have decided to participate in the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission and jointly discuss the establishment of a Korean provisional government. This still represents the majority of the Korean people. As for the demonstrators and rioters, they can only represent an extremely small number of stubborn Koreans.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Agrees to Discuss the Marshall Plan, Various Reactions, Some Optimistic, Some Skeptical</h3>
<p>[Reuters London 23rd] Diplomatic observers here have varying reactions to the Soviet Union's unconditional acceptance of the British and French invitation to jointly discuss the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe. Some are optimistic, while others are skeptical. Everything depends on whether the Soviet Union will actively participate in the common design of Europe and prevent the collapse of the European economy in a timely manner, or whether its acceptance is only a prelude to adopting a delaying strategy in the three-way negotiations. This answer can only be obtained after the three foreign ministers start meeting, but it is expected that Bevin and Bidault will urge Molotov to make a quick decision on this key point. The Soviet Union's future proposals deserve close attention. It is reported that the Soviet Union's attitude is indeed different from the opinions previously published by Pravda, or its acceptance is only to avoid being blamed for resisting the Western countries' attempt to revive Europe.</p>
<p>Observers' speculation is mostly focused on the conditions that Molotov will put forward when he meets Bevin and Bidault on Friday. Judging from the Soviet Union's note announcing its acceptance of the British and French invitation, Molotov will probably first ask to know the content of the recent talks between Bevin and Ramadier and Bidault in Paris. However, in fact, that meeting was purely exploratory in nature, and most of it involved the details of how Britain and France would contact the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is expected that Britain and France will not be able to provide the Soviet Union with more information on that request. Molotov's next step will be to announce his views on reviving the European economy based on the principles of American aid and European self-help. London expects that Molotov will definitely declare that the primary condition for the Soviet Union to participate in the European economic design is that this design must be purely economic in nature and must not be accompanied by any political conditions. It is thought that Britain and France will not oppose this request, because Britain has always advocated that political issues should not be involved when dealing with the aftermath of the world economy, and France's policy is to maintain a strict balance between American and Soviet viewpoints. Furthermore, now that the Soviet Union has expressed its acceptance, it is expected that Eastern European countries will soon also react to the Marshall Plan. People here are very interested in the fact that Polish communist newspapers are still fiercely criticizing the Marshall Plan, but it is expected that such attitudes will soon suddenly change, like the Soviet Union's recent actions.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris 23rd] People here tonight speculate that the three-way foreign ministers' meeting on the 27th will probably become a "showdown" scene to determine whether the Soviet Union and the Western European group can ultimately cooperate to implement European economic policies, or whether they will be divided into two opposing groups. French newspapers also believe that the Paris meeting will have "decisive" significance.</p>
<p>[United Press Moscow 23rd] Observers here said that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's happy acceptance of the invitation from Britain and France to discuss the Marshall Plan, and his proposal to hold a three-way foreign ministers' meeting in Paris, has removed a major obstacle to the progress of the meeting. Molotov's willingness to personally go to Paris, rather than suggesting that it be held in Eastern Europe near Moscow, is also a symbol of optimism, which shows that the Soviet Union is willing to cooperate in discussing Marshall's proposal. The point in Molotov's reply that the Soviet government still does not know the exact content of the Marshall Plan and the facts of the British and French Paris meeting can also be remedied before Molotov sets off this week. It is generally expected that the British and French embassies here will provide Molotov with all the information. Although the U.S. embassy here is not involved in this matter today, it is also expected that it will inform Molotov of the detailed meaning of the plan based on Marshall's speech at Harvard University. The general feeling here is that the success of the Paris meeting depends on the participating countries reaching an agreement quickly. Molotov is expected to have full authority to make major decisions on this trip. Foreign observers believe that after the Soviet Union accepted it, it has taken the initiative to potentially break the U.S. diplomatic advantage in Europe. After the Soviet Union cooperates to formulate an acceptable recovery plan, it will cause a problem for the United States, that is, whether to provide economic assistance to Eastern European countries in the same way as it treats Western European countries. If the U.S. Congress does not allocate funds after this plan is formulated, it will cause Europe to turn to the East, or at least the Eastern European countries will develop a dislike for the United States.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington 23rd] Although officials here expressed satisfaction with the Soviet Union's acceptance of the invitation to hold a three-way meeting to discuss the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe, they adopted a reserved attitude towards the outcome of the meeting. It is said that the Soviet Union has stated that the U.S. production industry has increased during the war, which is actually accusing the U.S. of getting rich during the war. In addition, the Soviet Union has also stated that the primary task of Europe is to restore the national economies of various countries. U.S. observers believe that this argument is difficult to explain, because Marshall's plan for aid to Europe refers to the revitalization of the entire European economy. U.S. government officials have strongly stated that the U.S. government welcomes any constructive measures taken by European countries to implement the Marshall Plan.</p>

<h3>Arrival of the Pan American Special Plane in Shanghai; American Journalist Group Transfers to Two Planes to Fly to Beijing; Chairman Receives Them at His Residence; The Plane Flies Back the Same Evening to Attend a Cocktail Reception and Dinner; Reception for Shanghai Journalists Today, Flying to Tokyo Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] A party of twenty-two people, including Mr. Howard, a leading figure in the American newspaper industry (in addition to the twenty-one names listed yesterday, there is also Mr. Argus, an employee of Pan American Airways), arrived in this city at 1:28 p.m. yesterday on the Pan American Airways "American Clipper" flying boat, which is circumnavigating the globe. It landed on the newly constructed cement runway at the Lunghua Airport. Also on board was the eldest daughter of Soong Tzu-wen. Among the Shanghai officials who went to welcome them were Mayor Wu, American Consul Davis, General Manager of China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Liu Jingyi, and dozens of other Chinese and foreign dignitaries. Mr. and Mrs. Soong Tzu-wen arrived just as the plane was landing to greet their beloved daughter.</p>
<p>The "American Clipper" is a Constellation-type four-engine giant aircraft, silver in color with wing-shaped blue markings painted on the head and tail (see yesterday's edition of this newspaper). The American and Chinese flags were prominently displayed on the nose of the plane. Upon landing, Mr. Trippe, President of Pan American Airways, appeared first, followed by Mr. Howard and others. Mr. Howard was wearing a yellowish-brown khaki suit and a bow tie. Mrs. Reid, owner of the New York Herald Tribune, was wearing a black casual dress. Mayor Lapham of San Francisco, with his white hair, looked cheerful, and everyone looked happy and energetic. Mayor Wu and other welcomers stepped forward to shake hands and exchange greetings.</p>
<p>Mayor Lapham of San Francisco and Mayor Wu are old friends and were particularly cordial. He said to Mayor Wu: "How have you been, sir? How are the people of Shanghai? The people of San Francisco send their regards to the people of Shanghai." Mayor Wu said, "Everything is fine. I also represent the people of Shanghai in extending greetings to the people of San Francisco." Mr. and Mrs. Soong Tzu-wen's daughter is returning to China for a vacation. Mr. and Mrs. Soong showed their daughter great affection and presented her with a bouquet of red roses.</p>
<p>At the invitation of Chairman Chiang, all the distinguished guests rested briefly after disembarking and immediately transferred to two CNAC passenger planes, XTT91 and 92, and took off at 1:55 p.m. to go to Beijing to meet with Chairman Chiang.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Answers Questions on the Current Military Situation</p>
<p>This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch reports: Mr. Howard and his party arrived in Beijing at 3:30 p.m. on two CNAC special planes. Director-General of the Government Information Office Dong Xian Guang welcomed them at the airport on behalf of Chairman Chiang. Mr. Howard and others then went by car to visit Premier Zhang Qun at the Executive Yuan for a brief conversation. Premier Zhang had originally prepared a luncheon, but it was canceled because Mr. Howard and others arrived in Beijing after lunchtime. They then went to Ambassador Stuart's residence to celebrate his birthday, and then met with Chairman Chiang. Chairman Chiang and Madame Chiang received the American journalist delegation at their residence on Huangpu Road and answered questions raised by the reporters on international and domestic situations, talking for about twenty minutes.</p>
<p>Madame Chiang, carrying a small black Tibetan sleeve dog, sat between Mrs. Reid of the New York Herald Tribune and Mrs. Howard of the Houston Post, and also expressed many opinions. After the meeting, Mr. Howard and others returned to Shanghai at 5:20 p.m. from Ming Palace Airport on the original plane.</p>
<p>Cocktail Reception for Guests</p>
<p>At around 6:00 p.m., the original plane returned to Shanghai from Beijing. Citibank, Standard Oil, and other companies held a cocktail reception at the Central Bank Club to entertain the guests. Foreign diplomats in Shanghai and Mrs. Reid, owner of the New York Herald Tribune, expressed great pleasure with this trip, and said that when they visited Chairman and Madame Chiang in Beijing in the afternoon, the Chairman held a press conference and made very important statements on the current situation, but it could not be published. Mrs. Reid refused to comment on the situation in China; regarding the Marshall Plan, she said that it would be limited to Europe for the time being, and although Korea was also on the list of aid recipients, she had not heard that this aid would be extended to the Far East. Mayor Lapham of San Francisco, with his ruddy complexion and white hair, was energetic and frequently chatted with people, saying that the trip to Shanghai was not only pleasant but also very interesting. Pan American Airways invited the journalist group to make a round-the-world flight, and he himself was not a reporter, but because he was very interested in the company's business development, he was also among those invited, so he had the opportunity to tour famous cities around the world in two weeks. But this trip was entirely for sightseeing, and he did not have any mission. His stay in China was too short, so he did not have time to inspect Shanghai's municipal administration.</p>
<p>Pan American Airways President Talks at Length with Zhang Jia'ao</p>
<p>During the cocktail reception, Mr. Trippe, President of Pan American Airways, had a long conversation with Mr. Zhang Jia'ao alone. He said that Shanghai was an important location on this round-the-world flight, and this was a test flight. Regular flights would begin within the week, taking the route through Guam, not through Shanghai. During his visit to Beijing, in addition to attending Chairman Chiang's press conference, he also met with Premier Zhang, General Yue, and Minister Yu Dawei to discuss Pan American Airways' expansion of its business in the East. He also said that his company had a definite plan for its development in the Far East, and there would be regular flights in the future. However, the development of business in China would depend on the situation in China.</p>
<p>Ministry of Communications Banquet to Welcome Guests</p>
<p>At 8:00 p.m., CNAC General Manager Liu Jingyi hosted a banquet at the International Hotel on behalf of Minister of Communications Yu Dawei to welcome the guests. The hosts and guests enjoyed themselves very much.</p>
<p>At 3:00 p.m. today, Mr. Howard and others will hold a reception at the Capital Hotel, and at 7:00 p.m., Mayor Wu will host a banquet to welcome them. They will leave Shanghai for Tokyo at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Two Chief Pilots Talk About Their Round-the-World Trip</p>
<p>The pilots who flew the round-the-world plane were Captains Maxwell and Gordon. Maxwell had served with the United Nations last year, and Gordon was visiting China for the first time. Both are chief pilots of Pan American Airways and were very happy with this trip. Of all the cities they passed through, they thought Bangkok was the most beautiful. From leaving New York to arriving in Shanghai, they had been in the air for 48 hours. The exact dates and times of their flights through each place are as follows: Departed New York on the 17th at 6:05 p.m. local time, arrived in Gander, Newfoundland, at 10:55 p.m., took off at 11:35 p.m., arrived in Ireland on the 18th at 7:25 a.m., took off at 9:00 a.m., arrived in London at 11:08 a.m., took off on the 19th at 0:20 a.m., arrived in Istanbul at 7:55 a.m., took off at 10:20 p.m., arrived in Daluan, Arabia, at 4:35 a.m. on the 20th, took off at 6:18 a.m., arrived in Karachi at 10:58 a.m., took off at 4:00 p.m., arrived in Calcutta at 9:42 p.m., took off at 1:00 a.m. on the 22nd, arrived in Bangkok at 5:25 a.m., took off at 10:25 a.m., arrived in Manila at 4:25 p.m., took off from Manila at 7:45 a.m. on the 24th, and arrived in Shanghai at 1:28 p.m. Except for a slight engine problem when taking off in Karachi, everything else went very smoothly.</p>
<h3>Order to Compile a List to Reward Shanghai Police</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Chairman Chiang greatly appreciates the service record of the Shanghai police in recent years and has telegraphed Director Xuan to compile a list of names so that rewards can be issued.</p>

<h3>Land Bureau Endeavors to Explore Reasonable Rent Standards</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Regarding the issue of rent standards in Shanghai, a reporter visited the person in charge of the Land Bureau yesterday to inquire about their views. It was reported that the current rent standard in Shanghai was set in March of the 35th year of the Republic (using the 26th year as the base), at 140 times for residential houses and 160 times for commercial houses. In the past year, prices have soared, and this standard is difficult to maintain. The landlord's rental income is not even enough to cover taxes, insurance fees, and repair costs. However, if the standard is abolished, it will inevitably increase housing disputes and affect social stability. For this reason, the Bureau has repeatedly invited real estate developers, senators, judicial organs, etc., to discuss revising the rent standard. After summarizing the opinions of all parties, ten regulations were formulated, stipulating that the rent standard should be based on the 26th year of the Republic, multiplied by the salary multiple of civil servants (currently 1800 times). This proposal was reserved by the Municipal Senate at the third plenary session, but the municipal government was still asked to revise the rent standard in light of the actual situation and crack down on excessively high rents. The Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association advocates setting standards in accordance with Article 97 of the Land Law. According to Article 97 of the Land Law: "The rent of houses in urban areas shall not exceed 10% per annum of the declared total value of the land and its buildings." Article 25 of the Enforcement Rules of the Land Law stipulates that "the so-called total value of the land and its buildings shall be the legally determined land price for the land price, and the price assessed by the local municipal and county land administration agencies for the building price." Although the legally determined land price in this city has been announced, the building valuation has not yet been carried out. This valuation work is extremely cumbersome and requires the cooperation of construction experts. Given the number of houses in this city, it may be difficult to complete in six months. In addition, issues such as (1) depreciation of houses, (2) indoor facilities, and (3) the different convenience of access and use of gardens and lawns on the top and bottom floors of high-rise buildings all make it difficult to set rents. The land price is estimated once every five years in peacetime, but now it is once a year. Therefore, if the standard is set according to the land price, it can be revised up to once a year, but the difference in price increases during the year cannot be predicted, so it is also inappropriate. At present, it is very difficult to find a standard that everyone is satisfied with. The Bureau is currently studying factors such as the land price index, the landlord's actual expenditure, the salary multiple of civil servants, and the affordability of citizens in order to find a reasonable standard.</p>
<h3>Re-election of Conveners of Three Committees of the Senate</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Yesterday, the Autonomy, Police, and Education Committees of the Municipal Senate held separate meetings to discuss proposals and re-elect conveners. The list of conveners is as follows: Autonomy: Xia, Chen Baotai, Zhu Wende; Police: Fei Shusheng, Hou Jiyuan, Zhang Nai Zuo; Education: Zhong Xingbai, Zhou Feicheng, Xu Zechi.</p>
<p>In addition, the Autonomy Committee resolved (1) to send Chen Kai to participate in the investigation of the false accusation against Bao Dayong, head of the Xuhui District; (2) to approve the letter from the Shanghai Municipal Government regarding the draft "Provisional Measures for Shanghai Municipality to Collect Preferential Gold for Deferring Conscription," and resolved to pass it in principle and send it to the Legal Committee for review. Matters discussed by the Police Committee (1) According to citizens, many theft cases have occurred on North Sichuan Road recently, but none have been solved. It was resolved to send a letter to the police station to effectively crack down on "leeches" and strictly prohibit theft. (2) According to the vendor Li Changren, the Changning Branch detained 27 vendors for no reason and imposed fines. It was resolved to send a letter to the police station to clarify the matter. Matters discussed by the Education Committee: (1) To approve the request from the Municipal Government for private school teachers and staff to apply for food rationing. It was resolved that the content of the case did not match the actual situation and was sent to the Municipal Government for correction before further discussion. (2) To approve the request from the Education Bureau for private school teachers and staff to apply for academic advancement fees. It was resolved to reserve it.</p>
<h3>Preparatory Committee for the Martyrs' Shrine Passes Articles of Association Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] The Shanghai Martyrs' Shrine Preparatory Committee held a meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. More than ten representatives from various organizations and groups attended. First, Cai Dianrong, director of the Fourth Division of the Du Hui Bureau, reported on the progress of the work, and then began the discussion.

<h3>Fire on Shouning Road</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] At about 8:30 a.m. yesterday, a fire broke out on the upper floor of No. 28, Lane 46, Shouning Road, because cooking oil was being boiled on a gas stove. The fire quickly became uncontrollable. The fire brigade dispatched three fire trucks and worked hard to extinguish it. It took about 45 minutes to put it out. The second and third floors of that building were burned down, and the lower floors of buildings No. 27 and No. 29 were also damaged by water.</p>
<h3>Symposium on Xinjiang Issues Calls for Strong Diplomatic Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Since the invasion of Xinjiang Province by the Outer Mongolian army, the Chinese people have expressed deep indignation. In order to allow all sectors of society to learn the truth and raise awareness, the Shanghai Municipal Party Department held a symposium on the Xinjiang issue at the Gymnasium at 2:00 p.m. yesterday, inviting Guang Lu, a Xinjiang legislator who recently came to Shanghai from Beijing, and Ma Yunwen, a commissioner of the Police Headquarters of the Ministry of the Interior, to be the main speakers. Ling Tiean, a member of the Tongmenghui who recently came to Shanghai from Beijing, Yu Lingyun, former director of the Xinjiang Provincial Construction Department, Ma Yanfu, manager of the Xinjiang Trading Company, Situ De, Li Ximou, Luo Dunwei, Yuan Gongwei, and others were also invited to attend. More than 1,500 people attended, and the atmosphere at the meeting was enthusiastic and focused from beginning to end, all captured by the cameras of China Electric Photographers. At the beginning of the symposium, Director Fang introduced Guang and Ma, and then Guang gave a brief description of the geographical environment and abundant resources of Xinjiang Province from his personal experience as a native of Xinjiang Province, and then gave a detailed description of the political evolution of Xinjiang Province since the founding of the Republic of China. Guang then stated that the Beitashan incident was not accidental, and that the background was that a certain country was eager to control the entire Xinjiang Province. It must be known that if Beitashan is lost, Xinjiang will be lost, and China's northwest national defense will also be lost. He called on the motherland to be strong and unified, to conduct strong diplomatic negotiations with the Soviet Union and Mongolia, never to give up, and to file a complaint with the United Nations. Afterwards, Ma Yunwen added a very detailed supplement. Finally, Ling Tiean and others asked the central government to resist aggression and thoroughly investigate the chief culprits who compromised with foreign countries in emotional and impassioned words.</p>
<h3>Adjudication Panel Still Adheres to the Principle of Self-Negotiation for Labor-Management Disputes; Active Handling of Disputes in Various Industries</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Since the Labor-Management Adjudication Committee decided to establish a Wage Evaluation Panel, labor-management dispute cases that cannot be resolved by the Social Affairs Bureau after the indexation freeze are transferred to the Evaluation Panel for handling. According to Secretary of the Adjudication Committee yesterday, the Wage Evaluation Panel has now begun work, but the evaluation procedure is cumbersome and time-consuming, so it cannot be resolved quickly in the short term. The Adjudication Committee still adheres to the principle of mutual consultation between the two parties for these labor-management disputes. If an agreement cannot be reached, the Adjudication Committee will handle it impartially.</p>
<p>The indexation disputes in the ship repair industry, sewing industry, and silk weaving industry have been sent to the Labor-Management Adjudication Committee for handling after the Social Affairs Bureau failed to mediate.</p>
<p>In the Hua Xin Aluminum and Steel Factory labor-management dispute, Director Wu personally convened labor and management for mediation a few days ago, but the two parties still failed to reach an agreement. The case will be adjudicated by the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>Due to the indexation dispute, a strike occurred in the hand-cranked machine group of the hosiery industry. Most of the workers in one area have resumed work, while the workers in the other two areas are staying in the factory. The factory owner is helpless, forming a stalemate. The Social Affairs Bureau has decided that during the adjudication period, the employer will pay the employees at the rate of 14,800 times for the second half of May. The workers disagree.</p>
<p>A few days ago, in the Changxing Dyeing and Weaving Factory, a worker was accused of theft by an employee, and a fight broke out between the two parties. The police station dispatched police to arrest them and released them on bail. The employees were dissatisfied and went on strike, and after persuasion, they resumed work. However, the workers went on strike again, and the Social Affairs Bureau has ordered them to resume work first. The assault can be sued in court.</p>
<h3>A Tragedy Caused by Three Pairs of Women's Socks; Merchant Accidentally Kills His Wife</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Chen Nanchun, 42, from Nantong, lives at No. 5, Chunde Lane, Tibet South Road. He runs a cotton yarn store on Daji Road in the Nanshi area. He has been married to Han Jinmei (26 years old) from Suzhou for many years and has a two-year-old son named Dingkang. At 11:30 a.m. yesterday, because he bought three pairs of women's socks to give to his mistress, Jinmei found out about it, and a dispute arose, which eventually led to violence. Chen was overwhelmed with anger and slammed her against the table, hitting Jinmei in the back of the head. She fell to the ground and bled profusely. Doctors were called to give her injections and treatment, but it was ineffective. She died around 1:00 p.m. Chen, seeing the disaster he had caused, fled without a trace. Afterwards, Shen Zuoluo, captain of the Dangshan Police Branch, and staff member Zhang Jingfang investigated the case. The body was sent to the Tongren Gyuantang for safekeeping, and Zhang was sent out to search for the murderer.</p>
<h3>Distribution of Rice to Professional Workers; Distribution Method Being Considered</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian told reporters yesterday that if the distribution of rice to professional workers cannot be done this month, it will be implemented starting next month. This issue is quite troublesome, and the Social Affairs Bureau is considering how to distribute it. Workers such as dockworkers, rickshaw pullers, and tricycle drivers do not have fixed employers, and the labor unions are unable to pay in advance. The Bureau is currently drafting principles to designate specific rice stores as distribution points. If there are fixed employers, the employers will purchase the rice on behalf of the workers and then distribute it.</p>
<h3>Prostitute Registration Deadline at the End of the Year</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] The police station originally set the deadline for prostitute registration at the end of June, but now, by order of the municipal government, it has been extended to the end of this year. According to Bao Tianyi, captain of the Customs and Morals Section of the Bureau, the total number of registered prostitutes to date exceeds 6,000. However, he estimates that at least twice as many prostitutes have not yet registered with the Bureau. Therefore, the Bureau will send staff to conduct detailed investigations during this extension period, and if necessary, crack down on unregistered private prostitutes. There are about 100 licensed brothels in the city, including more than 20 former shelter homes that have been reorganized into brothels.</p>
<h3>Yang Xirong's Gold and Dollar Case; District Attorney's Office Declines to Prosecute</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] On February 27 of this year, when the Ministry of Finance, together with the Economic Supervision Team, sent personnel to inspect the Shanghai branch of the Juxingcheng Bank, more than 350 taels of gold, 36,000 US dollars, 2,000 US dollar drafts, and 4,000 US dollar savings bonds were found in the office safe of Deputy Manager Yang Xirong. He claimed that they were items deposited by relatives and friends, but there was no evidence of deposit. Yang also opened an account at the bank and exchanged the bank's promissory notes to purchase gold, and overused bank funds of 10.053 million yuan from January 18 to January 25 of this year. A letter was sent to the District Attorney's Office for investigation to determine whether he violated the measures to crack down on gold speculation, the measures to prohibit the circulation of foreign currency, and the crime of embezzlement under the Criminal Law. After investigation, the District Attorney's Office announced yesterday that it would not prosecute.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Grain Merchants to Apply for Registration Extended to the End of July</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] The Social Affairs Bureau began to handle the registration of grain merchants in October of last year in order to protect the rights and interests of legitimate grain merchants and prevent unscrupulous merchants from illegally engaging in parties, and set a deadline for completion. Currently, the number of those who have applied for registration is small, and many are waiting and watching. The Bureau announced yesterday that it would extend the deadline to the end of July of this year for all to complete registration. All unregistered grain merchants in this city must apply for registration with the Bureau in accordance with the law before the deadline. If the deadline is exceeded again, they will be dealt with in accordance with Article 21 of the Grain Merchant Registration Regulations (punishable for hoarding and profiteering) and Article 22 (punishable with a fine of less than 1,000 yuan and may be ordered to suspend business).</p>

<h3>Bad Check Fraud; Cotton Cloth Boss Flees; Losses of Various Victims Reach Over 800 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] The day before yesterday, Lu Junfu, a cotton cloth merchant living at No. 9, Lane 676, Fengyang Road, reported to the Old Gate Police Branch, accusing Xu Bingxian, the owner of Zhenchang Cotton Cloth Store at No. 171, Guizhou Road, of using bad checks to defraud goods worth 158.4 million yuan. After receiving the report, Branch Chief Shi immediately ordered Captain Jiang Shangpei to supervise staff member Song Shaomei to investigate. It was learned that Xu rented No. 171, Guizhou Road on April 16 to open the Zhenchang Cotton Cloth Store. After successively purchasing cotton cloth on the 19th, 20th, and 21st, he secretly moved it out through the back door. After being reported, Xu went into hiding. The branch police worked hard to investigate. That afternoon, they retrieved 322 pieces of the original stolen goods. The next morning, they seized another 20 pieces of cotton cloth (a total of 20 sacks) in a warehouse. About two-thirds of the stolen goods have been recovered. The criminal Xu Bingxian is currently being hunted. In addition, it was learned that there were many other households that were defrauded of goods in the same way. The victims who have been identified are Chen Xiqi (living at No. 12, Longquanyuan Road, Nanjing Road), Lin Weile (living at No. 15, Lane 609, Chengdu Road), Gao Mingzu (living at No. 61, East Siwen Lane, Xinzha Road), Shen Fenglin (living at No. 18, Ruyi Lane, Henan Road), Ma Lechen (living at No. 6, Zhifu Lane, Fujian Road), Yao Huiqiu (living at No. 103, Wenzhou Road), Zhou Renlin (living at No. 356, Beijing Road), Luo Zixiang (living at No. 9, Ruihua Fang, Fuxing Middle Road), and Dai Renci (living at No. 60, Zunde Lane, Xiamen Road).

<h3>Simplification of Income Tax Collection: Business Associations and Guilds to Assist in Pilot Implementation</h3>

The detailed rules will be discussed and decided by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, various industry guilds, and the Tax Bureau within the coming week. Once the standardized simplification pilot begins, the comprehensive audit will be suspended.</p>
<h3>Novelist Zhang Ziping Prosecuted for Aiding the Enemy</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhang Ziping, famous for writing triangular love novels, has been publicly prosecuted by the High Procuratorate on suspicion of being a traitor because he participated in a puppet organization during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai. Zhang is 52 years old and a native of Meixian, Guangdong. He studied geology at Tokyo Imperial University in Japan, but his interest lies in literature. During the May Fourth Movement, he and his fellow students Guo Moruo, Yu Dafu, Cheng Fangwu, Wang Duqing, and others organized the "Creation Society" and published the "Creation Quarterly." His works include "苔莉 [Tai Li]", "飛絮 [Flying Catkins]", "梅嶺之春 [Spring in Meiling]", "明珠與黑炭 [Pearl and Coal]", "冲積期化石 [Alluvial Fossils]", "聖　的前一夜 [The Night Before the Saint]", and dozens of other short and long stories. He was once regarded as the Chinese "Kikuchi Kan." Between 1927 and 1930, his works were popular for a time. Later, his reputation declined sharply after his long novel "待代與愛的歧路 [Waiting and the Crossroads of Love]" was cut short by the editor Li Liewen when it was published in this newspaper's "Free Talk" section. After joining the puppet organization, he published the lengthy "新紅A字 [New Red A]," but its layout was still monotonous, and his career declined. After the victory, he once fled to Taiwan and disappeared, but then returned to Shanghai, where he was reported. After an investigation by the Municipal Party Department, he was transferred to the High Procuratorate for interrogation. It was found that Zhang participated in the Puppet Executive Yuan's Cultural Relics Preservation Committee's Museum Special Committee as a specialist member in the spring of the 32nd year (of the Republic), and later served as a specially appointed technician in the Puppet Ministry of Industry, violating Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors and Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations on Handling Traitor Cases, and was prosecuted according to law.</p>

<h3>Accountant Raises Three Key Points in Chung Yuen Trading Company's Gold Specie Case: Accounting Unit Not Distinguishable on Ledger</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Shoutao, the prosecutor handling the case of Iraqi A. S. Garden of Chung Yuen Trading Company illegally engaging in gold specie transactions and disrupting the financial market, had the company's accounts examined by an accountant. According to the accountant's examination report, three key points were raised:</p>
<p>(1) Before February 15 of this year, the journal of Chung Yuen Trading Company was entirely in U.S. dollars. After February 15, the amount in national currency was recorded simultaneously, with an exchange rate of 12,000 yuan of national currency per U.S. dollar. However, whether the receipts and payments were in national currency or U.S. dollars is indistinguishable on the ledger. (2) Since April 1 of this year, the entries in the journal have not yet been posted to the general ledger. (3) From February 16 to April 17 of this year, according to the journal, cash receipts totaled 31,285.29 U.S. dollars, equivalent to 375,423,480 yuan of national currency, and cash disbursements totaled 19,846.99 U.S. dollars, equivalent to 238,163,880 yuan of national currency. Of these, expenditures related to customer securities totaled 17,916.99 U.S. dollars. However, 600 U.S. dollars was paid on April 1 (including 300 U.S. dollars for Customer A's securities and 300 U.S. dollars for expenses, with the words "registration fee" noted in the summary). If this is also included in the calculation, it will not match the amount in the summary. In addition, there is a sales book with a large number of entries from February 25 to April 24.</p>
<h3>Dysentery and Typhoid Cases Reported</h3>

Cholera was discovered on May 23 last year, but there have been no cases so far this year. As the weather is gradually getting hotter, the Bureau of Health is stepping up prevention efforts.</p>
<h3>Precarious Situation of Jingjiang Levee: Hubei Compatriots in Shanghai Appeal to All Sectors; Zhang Zhiben and Others Report on the Serious Situation</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Hubei Association of Compatriots in Shanghai hosted representatives from all sectors of the city at the Sullivan on Nanjing Road at 4:00 PM yesterday. Zhang Zhiben, who recently returned from tomb sweeping in his hometown (Jiangling), reported on the increasingly serious flood situation and banditry in Hubei and appealed to the public to hope that the government would quickly seek effective remedies to save tens of millions of victims.</p>
<p>Unimaginable Situation During the Autumn Flood Season</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang briefly stated: The Jingjiang Levee, which concerns the lives of tens of counties in Hubei, is now in a precarious situation. The Qijia Yuan section of the levee between Shashi and Hao Xue has collapsed, and there is already a deep pool inside the levee. Because the river water level is tens of feet above the ground, the province of Hubei is in danger of submersion once the levee collapses. Fortunately, the spring flood has been barely passed, but the autumn flood season is approaching in the blink of an eye. During the Anti-Japanese War, the levee body was neglected and destroyed by artillery fire. The Jianghan Engineering Bureau, which is responsible for repairing the levee, did not repair it in advance during the winter when the water level was low. Now that the water level is rising daily, the bureau is only hastily repairing it with thin wood, reeds, and weeds. The danger is truly unimaginable when the autumn flood arrives.</p>
<p>Dongting Lake Surface Gradually Shrinking</p>
<p>The area of Dongting Lake is gradually shrinking, and the water storage capacity is sharply reduced because a small number of people with local evil forces enclose the silted land on the edge of the lake, build embankments, and cultivate the lake bottom. Although the government has long explicitly prohibited this and the Water Conservancy Commission of the Executive Yuan has organized a supervision committee to order the demolition of these private embankments, it has been repeatedly delayed and has not yet been earnestly implemented, causing Dongting Lake to lose its regulatory function.</p>
<p>In terms of banditry, Hao Xue Town was looted by bandits on the first day of the lunar new year this year. It was reported that there were only hundreds of bandits at the time. Later, they crossed the river and fled south into Gong'an County and the border area between Hunan and Hubei. Recently, they have returned to the north bank, harassing Dangyang and other places. The number of bandits has reached thousands. If they are not suppressed quickly, they will become a major disaster for Hunan and Hubei.</p>
<p>Riverbed Higher Than Rooftops</p>
<p>Hu Qiuyuan and Qian Nashui then supplemented the report on the importance of the safety of the Jingjiang Levee. The main points are as follows: (1) The Qijia Yuan section of the Jingjiang Levee has been eroded by the river flow for many years, and half of the levee foot has been destroyed. Now that the flood season is approaching, the rush repair project has failed to meet the actual needs, causing people to panic and be unable to sleep or eat. (2) The Jingjiang Levee is the barrier to the lives and property of Jiangling, Jianli, Mianyang, Qianjiang, and parts of Jingmen and Hanyang. The levee is more than a hundred miles long and rises to more than ten feet high, while the riverbed has already reached the height of the rooftops inside the levee. If any part of the levee collapses, houses within hundreds of miles will be submerged, and millions of people will be unable to escape. (3) Dongting Lake was originally a reservoir for floodwaters from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The various embankments surrounding Datong Lake (with Tianyou Embankment as the general name) greatly reduce the flood storage capacity, which is enough to raise the water level of the river and further increase the burden on the Jingjiang Levee, especially the danger of the Qijia Yuan section. Although the central government has explicitly ordered the demolition, it has not yet started due to the obstruction of a small number of local landlords. Recently, there has been talk of postponing the demolition, which is tantamount to disregarding the lives of millions of people. (4) If the embankments around Datong Lake are not demolished, the result will not only be that the two banks of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River will suffer from major floods, but also many counties in Hunan will be harmed. Therefore, in the past, there were many enlightened people in Hunan who advocated prohibiting the construction of embankments around Dongting Lake. At the same time, the harm of reducing the flood storage capacity of Dongting Lake is not limited to this. All areas within Hubei and even along the Yangtze River in the lower reaches will also be in danger of levee collapse due to the increased water level of the river.</p>
<p>Demolition Order Should Be Implemented Resolutely</p>
<p>(4) Even if the demolition of the embankments around Datong Lake affects the livelihoods of some people, it will only be tens of thousands or at most hundreds of thousands of people. Compared with the safety of the lives and property of millions or tens of millions of people, the seriousness of the interests involved cannot be measured by reason. Moreover, the central government has already allocated relief funds to the people of each embankment. (5) The issue of whether to keep or demolish the embankments around Datong Lake is not a dispute between the people of Hubei and the people of Hunan, but should be viewed from the perspective of the entire country and from a humanitarian point of view. If the Jingjiang Levee collapses, millions of lives will be sacrificed, which is a great loss to the country and goes against humanity. The harm of the collapse of the Jingjiang Levee is certainly to the entire country, and the same is true of the collapse of other levees, but the disaster of the collapse of the Jingjiang Levee is even more tragic. (6) The Jingjiang Levee was highly valued in the late Qing Dynasty. If it collapsed, administrative officials at all levels would be held accountable, because the levee had repeatedly received funds from the treasury for repairs and was called the "Imperial Project Levee." It was commonly called the "Emperor's Levee," which shows the importance of its relationship to the lives of the people. To ensure the safety of the levee, Dongting Lake was never allowed to compete with the water for land. After the establishment of the National Government, it did not neglect this important levee. Before the war, funds were allocated every year to repair the levee, as in the past, and it was forbidden to build embankments in Dongting Lake that would hinder flood storage. It is bewildering that the demolition order has been issued for a long time, but its strict enforcement has not been insisted upon. (7) It is hoped that the press will uphold justice and urge the government to supervise the urgent repair of the Jingjiang Levee, especially the dangerous Qijia Yuan section, from the perspective of the interests of the entire country and from a humanitarian standpoint, and to immediately and strictly implement the order to demolish the embankments around Datong Lake.</p>
<h3>Adulterated Dregs Passed Off as Saccharin: Zhou Kuangnan's Peddling Exposed; Denied and Accused Others After Arrest</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, many fake saccharin products have been discovered on the market. The Lao Zha Police Station in this city cracked a case a few days ago and arrested the principal offender, Zhou Kuangnan. Zhou is a native of Suzhou, 31 years old, and lives at 231 Bizhou Road. He used to run a canned food business. Six years ago, he switched to saccharin and established the Zhongnan Saccharin Factory. Recently, the bureau suddenly had a whimsical idea, arbitrarily mixed four large cans of Longpu Ling saccharin from Paris with coarse sugar dregs, and took the goods to the Zhongmao Pharmacy at 238 Guangxi Road to negotiate a sale. The Zhongmao business director, Qi Yungao, saw through the scheme and discovered that the goods were fake. Zhou claimed that the goods were distributed by Yongxing Western Medicine Store at 51 Hong Kong Road. Qi called Yongxing to inquire and rushed to investigate, only to learn that Zhou was using fake goods to deceive the market. He reported the case to the Lao Zha Police Station, which sent officers to arrest Zhou and search his home. More than ten cans of fake saccharin and eighteen small bottles, and thirty-eight packages were seized. The saccharin was mixed with coarse sugar, and the label "Product of Zhongnan Saccharin Factory" was affixed, stating that the sweetness was 500 degrees, as well as other counterfeit stamps and trademarks. After the police station interrogated Zhou strictly, he still tried to deny the charges and claimed that the goods were purchased from Chen Mingxiang, the manager of the Zhongfu Pharmacy at 17, Lane 146, Nanjing Road. Chen was summoned to the bureau to investigate the truth and officers were sent to Zhongfu to inspect the goods. It was confirmed that there were no fake goods mixed in. Zhou finally admitted that he acted alone. The case has been investigated by the bureau and will be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for questioning in the coming days.</p>

<h3>Ying Changqi Soon to Complete National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraph Dictionary</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 24th] Ying Changqi, manager of the business department of the Bank of Taiwan, will complete a book entitled "National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraph Dictionary" in July. The telegraph codebook currently used in China uses four Arabic numerals to form a Chinese character, and each telegraph symbol for a Chinese character has five actions, that is, each Chinese character requires twenty actions, which is behind the English telegraph code. Only 1,200 characters can be telegraphed per hour, which is too slow and time-consuming. Ying intends to use Roman letters to spell out the pronunciation of Mandarin Chinese, and then send telegrams according to Roman letters, that is, to convert Chinese characters into English for telegraphing. According to his research, after this reform, each Chinese character will only require ten actions, that is, the telegraphing speed will be doubled, and the working speed of telegraph operators can also be increased by more than double.</p>

<h3>Orchid Island Survey Team Returns to Taiwan - National Taiwan University President Lu Zhihong Hosts Tea Party to Express Appreciation - Animal Specimens Include One Bear Rat - Research Reports to be Released Soon</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 24th] The Orchid Island Scientific Survey Team, consisting of sixty members who had worked diligently, with the exception of seven meteorology group members who will remain on Orchid Island for long-term typhoon observation, have all returned to Taipei with their collected specimens. The last group of two professors also rushed back to Taipei a few tens of minutes before the arrival of the typhoon the night before last. The team spent a total of three weeks traveling to and from Orchid Island. They are currently expediting the sorting of various specimens, and various research reports will be released soon. As of now, five team members have fallen ill due to overwork. Lu Zhihong, president of National Taiwan University, held a tea party today to host all team members and express appreciation. It is reported that the professors from the team's marine, medical, botanical, and mineralogical groups collected extremely rich specimens, totaling several hundred boxes. However, the vertebrate zoology professor from the animal group only captured one precious black bear rat. Furthermore, because the island has no venomous snakes or fierce beasts, the two professors studying venomous snakes and fierce beasts returned disappointed, having found nothing. A Central News Agency reporter recently interviewed Dr. Ma Shanying, Dean Chen Lijie, and agricultural economist Liu Jisheng of the team, who stated that Orchid Island is rich in marine fish resources and has great potential for fisheries development. During the "village tide" festival, schools of fish migrate to the waters near Orchid Island, and the islanders often extract them by hand. During the transition from spring to summer, schools of extremely delicious flying fish arrive, and at night, the "bonfires" set by the islanders in the shallow sea are constantly swarmed, resembling moths attracted to lights, creating a spectacular sight. The islanders mostly use harpoons to catch schools of skipjack tuna weighing several tens of kilograms. When diving, marine scientists on the team unexpectedly entered a "crystal palace," often seeing colorful fish, shrimp, and live coral, as well as nocturnal shells, roaming among the seaweed and seaweed leaves, a truly enjoyable sight. The aquatic plants on Orchid Island are also extremely abundant. Some experts have determined that it is an "ideal place" for livestock grazing. The sheep raised by the islanders are all released into the wild throughout the island. "Little Orchid Island," located three miles south of Orchid Island, is an uninhabited island. The islanders use wooden boats to transport sheep, release them there, and then return directly, allowing the sheep to live and breed on their own. They return to retrieve them after a few months or years. It is also said that Orchid Island is an uncultivated virgin land, and everything remains in its original state, making it not only a "library" for archaeologists and scientists but also a "Peach Blossom Spring of Wuling," a refuge from the Qin dynasty.</p>

<h3>Qunsheng Suffers Crushing Defeat to Xinghua Team - Team Members' Out-of-Line Behavior Heavily Criticized</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 24th] In last night's basketball game between the Xinghua Team and the Qunsheng Team, Xinghua won the victory they deserved with a score of 46 to 41. The audience numbered about 10,000 people and was extremely crowded. The British Governor of Malaya and Singapore, MacDonald, and his wife, as well as the Chinese Consul General, Wu Bosheng, and his wife, also attended the game. The game began with great tension, and both sides were evenly matched. However, due to the Qunsheng Team's lack of good sportsmanship, a small dispute arose. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, the Qunsheng Team was penalized one point. The team protested and argued fiercely. Since they could not change the referee's decision, they refused to continue the game. After Consul General Wu persuaded them, they resumed the game. From then on, the Qunsheng Team was often booed by the audience to express their protest. Lacking sportsmanship, the Qunsheng Team also adopted crude tactics. As a result, when the Xinghua Team had a nine-point lead with only four minutes remaining, the Qunsheng Team was penalized again for a personal foul. They threatened to leave the game, and Yang Renhui, their right guard, even insulted the referee who penalized him for the foul. Therefore, he was ejected from the game. When the game resumed, their forward, Chen Jinzhi, deliberately pushed Hou Hu, a star player of the Xinghua Team, to the ground, and he was also ejected from the game. From then on, although the Qunsheng Team made a final counterattack, they were defeated by a difference of five points. In the first quarter, the Qunsheng Team took the lead with a score of 11 to 7. In the second quarter, Xinghua caught up with a score of 24 to 15. After that, the team always took the lead, and by the end of the third quarter, they still led with a score of 36 to 30. In the end, the crowd was very angry. A group of spectators on the field surrounded the Qunsheng Team in a corner of the sports field, preventing an accident. The Qunsheng Team's poor sportsmanship has been severely criticized by various newspapers today.</p>

<h3>Various Groups Compete to Absorb and Deconsume, Leading to a Sharp Increase - Rice Prices Reach New High - Jingbo Rice Already Approaching the 500,000 Mark</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The rice market opened for business yesterday after a two-day closure on Sunday and the Dragon Boat Festival. Merchants were crowded, and the atmosphere was lively. Due to the holiday closures, various groups were eager to purchase, leading to a sharp increase in decumption. Coupled with the impact of rising prices of other commodities, the public sentiment was unanimously optimistic, and Jingbo rice actually approached the 500,000 mark. The market softened slightly at the close, but was still 20,000 to 30,000 yuan higher than last week. Due to the end of the Dragon Boat Festival, the market for Yinbai rice turned sluggish, so the market trend remained stable.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the total registered arrivals of various groups were 1,796.6 dan at the South Market and 4,263 dan at the North Market. High-quality white rice traded at 465,000 to 470,000 yuan, and special regular rice traded at 480,000 yuan. Jingbo rice traded at 475,000 yuan, early rice at 460,000 yuan.

<p>[Another Report] Taiwan rice has arrived in Shanghai sporadically. The rice quality is slightly similar to that of Changxi white rice and is very good. A small number of Sichuan rice continues to arrive as well.</p>
<p>The supply and demand of flour are balanced, and the market situation is stable. Bran is trending towards softening. Soybean cake rose first and then fell. Factory soybeans are fair and upright, but Yingkou cakes are selling well and have risen by another 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. Green soybeans are selling well and rising slowly, increasing by varying amounts of 2,000 to 5,000 yuan. Green beans are selling widely and slightly moving. High-quality goods have rebounded by 10,000 yuan, medium-quality goods have also risen by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, but secondary goods are still rarely traded. Red beans are being purchased in Nanyang and have continued to rise by 10,000 yuan. Raw peanuts are being heavily absorbed in southern Shanghai and have jumped by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, soaring continuously.</p>
<p>Sesame continues to show strength. Foreign merchants have successively increased prices by another 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Red sorghum has followed with an increase of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and corn has also increased by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Southern Touwan beans are being actively traded and have advanced by 10,000 yuan. Shantou Taiwanese traders are competing to purchase broad beans, and the price continues to rise by 10,000 yuan. The future trend still depends on exports. Wheat is stable. The oil market is extremely volatile. Prices rose sharply in the morning, but many orders were placed in the afternoon, leading to a straight-line decline. In the end, the price was slightly higher than on Saturday by 10,000 yuan. Vegetable sesame oil had no honor or disgrace at the end of the day.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Grain Merchants Registration Extended to the End of July</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau, noting that the grain merchant registration deadline had passed and a small number were still intending to wait and see, which was a clear disregard of government regulations, issued another public notice yesterday stating that, in order to protect the rights of legitimate grain merchants and prevent illegal operations by unscrupulous merchants, the bureau had begun processing grain merchant registrations in October of the previous year, issuing public notices and urging applications within the specified time. It has been found that a large number of applications were submitted within the deadline, but a significant number were also waiting and seeing. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Government has forwarded an order from the Ministry of Food to complete the registration within a specified time, which should be implemented. To show consideration for grain merchants, the deadline is specially extended to the end of July of this year for all to complete their registrations. All unregistered grain merchants in the city must come to the bureau to apply for registration according to law before the deadline. Those who fail to do so will be dealt with according to Articles 21 and 22 of the Grain Merchant Registration Rules.</p>
<p>Article 21 of the Grain Merchant Registration Rules states that those who engage in the purchase and sale of grain without registering and obtaining a business license in accordance with the rules will be punished for the crime of hoarding and speculating in accordance with Article 2 of the Temporary Regulations on Punishing Food Management Violations in Extraordinary Times. Article 22 states that those who engage in the business of grain warehouses, grain processing, or grain brokerage without registering and obtaining a business license in accordance with the rules will be fined up to 1,000 yuan and may be ordered to suspend operations.</p>
<h3>Curbing the Edible Oil Price Surge: China Trust Bureau Allocates Soybeans for Oil Extraction</h3>
<p>The price surge of soybean oil has been endless in recent days. At the opening of the market on the 24th, the surge was even more intense. Soybean oil was priced at 720,000 yuan per dan, but after hoarders dumped their stocks, it suddenly fell to 660,000 yuan. At the close, it recovered to 680,000 yuan. The average price of all goods rose by about 15,000 to 20,000 yuan. The China Trust Bureau, aware of this situation, believes that unless it quickly seeks to increase production and prevent the oil from falling into the hands of middlemen, it will not be enough to quell the price surge.</p>
<p>The bureau convened a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 24th with key personnel from the Third District Vegetable Oil Refining Industry Association. As a result, it was decided that the first batch of a large quantity of soybeans previously shipped from the Northeast by the bureau would be allocated, with 2,300 tons to be delivered to the association for oil extraction. The quantity allocated to each factory has also been determined. The China Vegetable Oil Factory will receive 760 tons, Da You Yu 400 tons, Da Chang and Xin Xia De 380 tons each, and Shun Yu, Tong Sheng, and Tai 190 tons each. It is estimated that after the delivery, within a week, based on the oil yield of 10.5 jin of oil per dan of Northeast soybeans, 241.5 tons of soybean oil can be produced, totaling 4,830 dan. At that time, the association will deliver all of it to the China Trust Bureau, which will allocate it to the Civil Food Adjustment Committee for distribution. The processing fee for each factory is set at 20,000 yuan in national currency per dan of raw materials. As for the disposal of soybean cakes, it is planned that the factories will purchase them at a price.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Director Talks About the Main Causes of Price Fluctuations: Speculators Create Rumors and Stir Up Trouble</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau said yesterday: The recent price fluctuations after the Dragon Boat Festival are mainly due to the many rumors in the market. These people fear that the world will not be in chaos, so they spread rumors that 50,000-yuan banknotes will be issued, which the authorities cannot effectively refute. The rise in rice prices is due to the recent wind and rain, which resulted in fewer arrivals. Now that the weather has cleared, it is believed that prices will stabilize. The Price Evaluation Committee does not plan to convene this month, as gauze is controlled by the Gauze Adjustment Committee, coal is managed by the Fuel Management Committee, rice sales have been liberalized, and sugar prices are set by a subcommittee.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Stock Market Reverses: Major Players Go From Long to Short</h3>
<p>Yesterday, hot money from the Yarn and Cotton Gangs continued to absorb Chinese stocks. The Hong Kong and Shanghai telegrams again reported a severe decline. Yong Yarn showed repeated signs of activity midway, but without the support of major players who went from long to short, the upward momentum lacked support. The overnight interest rate rose to 0.36 and 0.405, and with the bullish trend reversed, buyers found the burden difficult. Moreover, retail buyers on the floor added to their positions at lower prices after hearing rumors. Before the close, they were forced to resist no longer within the "breakeven" limit due to time constraints, and finally turned from tight to weak, closing at lower prices.</p>
<p>Although the National Bank had a large gap upward from the previous day's close in the morning, most stocks opened higher except for underwear, which opened half a percent lower, due to the severe decline reported by the Hong Kong and Shanghai telegrams and rumors from Hong Kong that Sino-US loans were unfavorable. After Yong Yarn opened, it advanced from 14, 104, 142, and 160 to 9,000 yuan, but 97, 148, 8, 24, 91, 223, 55, and 65 took profits at the high, falling to 8,780 yuan. 129, 36, 228, and 231 took advantage of the low to advance to 8,900 yuan, but 61, 97, and 65 continued to sell. At this time, 231, 104, and 105 still had appetite and struggled quite a bit between 8,800 and 8,900 yuan. With money still tight, 97, 134, 24, 56, 207, 105, 121, and 49 dumped their positions, and Yong Yarn fell to around 8,650 yuan. After 224 covered their shorts at the low, 14, 153, 223, 32, 107, 105, 135, 142, 183, and 69 gradually absorbed shares, and prices gradually recovered. 231 and 106 re-entered the market after exiting, rising to 9,060 yuan. After entering, there was a tug-of-war within the 9,000 yuan range. Finally, with the Hong Kong and Shanghai telegrams reporting a contraction to 11 yuan, sentiment remained bullish. 14, 224, 232, 83, 223, 148, 57, and 185 all entered the market, rising to 9,220 yuan. 186 and 23 took advantage of the high to offer shares, retreating to 9,100 yuan. 218, 102, 152, and 171 bought aggressively, pushing Yong Yarn up to 9,230 yuan. 61, 197, 94, 104, 155, 207, and 163 dumped their shares, retreating to 8,900 yuan. Although 188, 152, and 171 advanced to above 9,000 yuan, 219, 224, 200, 223, 142, 65, and 213 fiercely sold off. 157 even actively offered more spot Yong Yarn for sale. Near the close, there were many taking profits on the floating gains, and rumors of peace circulated. Yong Yarn gradually fell to 8,560 yuan. 104 absorbed shares and closed at 8,600 yuan. After the close, the price was bid up to 8,680 yuan. However, spot Yong Yarn finally closed at a low of 8,400 yuan. Jing Lun once reported a limit down. In the end, compared to the previous close, spot trades of Yong Yarn, Xin He, Mei Ya, and Jing微 declined, Hua Feng, Yong Gong, Qin Xing fell about half a percent, Xin Guang and Zhong Fa each fell slightly more than half a percent, Xin Hua fell strongly by one and a half percent, and Li An, Rong Feng, Match, and Cement fell slightly. Jing Lun rebounded after a limit down, narrowing the decline to half a percent. Commerce, Zhong Fang, Da Tong, Zhong Si, and Guo Huo fell half a percent, and Xin Ya, Underwear, and Wu He fell about 10 percent. In deferred delivery trades, Yong Yarn, Xin He, Mei Ya, Xin Guang, Yong Gong, and Jing Fu all reported slight declines, Hua Feng fell strongly by half a percent, and Qin Xing fell weakly by one and a half percent. Among old stocks traded off the floor, Wu Zhou, Da Sheng, Zha Bei, and Hua Shang saw slight declines, Zhong Hua and Nan Yang saw slight gains, and Shi Jie remained flat.</p>

Yi Yarn opened at 74,000 yuan, with a high of 82,500 yuan, and finally closed at 76,000 yuan. Compared to the previous close, British Union fell slightly, Yi Beer Shipping rose strongly by half a percent, and the rest rose slightly. Securities firms bought shares and then sold them. Cantonese and Northern firms, as well as foreign merchants, bought shares, while retail investors continued to take profits.</p>
<h3>Northern Gang Gauze Merchants Petition the Textile Adjustment Committee to Request the Revocation of Northern Transportation Controls; North-South Transportation of Gauze Begins Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the Textile Industry Adjustment Committee took over the business of the Textile Control Committee, the committee's business office began handling applications for north-south transportation of gauze from textile manufacturers yesterday.</p>
<p>More than 100 Northern Gang gauze firms in the city, including China Gauze Company, Tianjin Chengxing, Yongfeng Gauze Shenzhuang, and Beijing Guoquan Gauze Shenzhuang, believe that their businesses have been greatly affected since the northern transportation of gauze was restricted. Yesterday, they jointly telegraphed the Textile Adjustment Committee, requesting the revocation of the northern transportation controls on gauze, allowing free transportation and sales, showing compassion for merchants' difficulties, and benefiting the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Gauze All See Solid Gains</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market opened flat in the morning, with retail investors selling off. Subsequently, due to the large amount of funds remitted to Shanghai by the Northern Gang, credit on the market eased, and buyers in the market suddenly became active. The prices of various yarns rose sharply from stable to sharply higher. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn rose dramatically by 1 million yuan, to 16.65 million yuan. 20-count Special Ma was pushed up by 300,000 yuan, Double Ma yarn rose by 150,000 yuan, and 16-count Guangming was pushed up to 8.4 million yuan, a sharp rise of 700,000 yuan. Market sentiment was quite bullish.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market opened in the morning with sellers offering goods, and 12-pound Longtou fine cloth fell to 384,000 yuan. Later, upon hearing that yarn prices were rising, customers actively bought, and the market stopped falling and rebounded. As a result, Longtou fine cloth rose to 400,000 yuan, a rise of 6,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Wu Fu, Cai Qiu, Zhen Zhong, and other fine cloths all rose by 3,000 to 10,000 yuan. Dark-colored Shilin cloth and blue cloth rose by 20,000 to 60,000 or 70,000 yuan due to repeated rises in grey fabrics. The prices of other bleached cloth, Yuan Zhi, and Tribute Silk all rose sharply.</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Bids Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market saw prices rise again and again, with Hong Kong exchange rates continuing to decline, and sentiment was extremely bullish. In addition, the prices of cotton yarn in the interior also soared, and those holding goods were unwilling to sell easily, with a consensus that the future was bright, so trading was quite thin. In the afternoon, trades made by the same industry for delivery to factories included Lingbao at 1.9 million, Hankou fine velvet at 1.66 million to 1.7 million, and Chong Shashi at 1.7 million to 1.72 million. Warehouse delivery prices included Lingbao at 1.89 million, Shashi at 1.7 million, Hankou fine velvet at 70,000, Bairuo Qu at 1.87 million, Da Zhong Ji fine velvet at 1.68 million, Weinan at 1.855 million, Nantai Cang at 1.35 million, Chong Tongzhou at 1.45 million, and Pudong Huoji at 1.24 million to 1.25 million, 1.27 million, Zhou Pu seed cotton at 225,000 to 245,000. There were also bids without transactions, including Bairuo Qu bid at 1.92 million, Tongzhou bid at 1.5 million, and Laohekou bid at 1.55 million.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Sells Cloth</p>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual, selling a total of 29,290 bolts of cloth and 660 blankets. 35 manufacturers applied to purchase 1,780 bolts of cloth. 1,025 cloth firms applied to purchase 27,510 bolts of cloth and 660 blankets.</p>
<h3>Manufacturers Request Restoration of Imports of Pencil Manufacturing Materials</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Recently, pencil factories in the city, such as Jincheng, Shanghai, and China Standard, have been prohibited from importing foreign raw materials such as foreign cedar and graphite powder. Domestic wood is obtained from Taiwanese cypress. Recently, due to the reorganization of the Taiwan Provincial Government, the issuance of wood export permits has also been temporarily suspended. These factories have recently requested the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office to issue a certificate to apply to the Taiwan Provincial authorities to resume issuing export permits. On the one hand, they still hope that the import management authorities can consider allowing the import of foreign cedar and graphite powder so that domestically produced pencils can technically compete with foreign goods. Domestic cypress and graphite powder can be used to make ordinary pencils. It is estimated that the output of the three factories is sufficient to meet the national demand.</p>
<h3>$60 Million in Daily Necessities Allocated From UNRRA Surplus Materials</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday's report that the United States will assist us in selling six types of daily necessities at low prices has been clarified by relevant parties that the origin of these materials is that UNRRA once proposed that after the agency closed, a portion (worth approximately 60 million US dollars) of the remaining relief materials of 350 million US dollars would be allocated to us, as we requested, with food accounting for the majority, and other items including sundries and pharmaceutical supplies being submitted separately. Currently, UNRRA is still negotiating plans for the distribution of these relief materials. If it is approved and shipped in the future, it may still be allocated to local governments for distribution.</p>
<p>As for the Distribution Materials Advisory Committee to be established by the Central Trust Bureau, this is because some of the distribution materials in this city are directly or indirectly related to the Central Trust Bureau. In order to facilitate coordination, the bureau has specially established this organization, so it has no special relationship with the relief materials distributed by UNRRA.</p>
<h3>Exporters Request Improvement in Methods of Purchasing Export Goods</h3>
<p>In order to solve the difficulties of the export industry, the government has specially purchased export goods, and relevant agencies have organized a purchasing committee to be responsible for handling this matter. This is the government's current policy, and exporters unanimously support it. However, exporters have raised two points of opinion regarding the purchase: (1) The purchase price should not be excessively lowered to avoid losses to exporters due to the purchase. (2) The purchase of export goods should be made from exporters at the export port. Purchasing directly from the production area will not only compete with the people for profit but also stimulate prices. It is said that exporters of tung oil and pig bristles will submit these two opinions in writing to the purchasing committee for consideration.</p>
<h3>Jewelry Industry Representatives Return to Shanghai, May Resume Business Next Month</h3>
<p>Representatives of the jewelry industry in the city who went to the capital to petition have returned to Shanghai yesterday. It is said that the industry can mostly accept several measures recently stipulated by the authorities, such as separating the prices of gold and jewelry, setting the gold content of jewelry at 70%, and changing the description to handmade products. Therefore, the authorities have decided to formally announce these measures to the public this month. As a result, jewelry stores in the city have been cleaning and decorating in a big way, planning to officially resume business from next month. As for whether jewelry stores that have already closed down will also resume business at the same time, it depends on the will of the person in charge, and it is difficult to say at present.</p>
<h3>Macau Bans Gold Imports</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 24th] Macau banned the import of gold from the 23rd, on the grounds that China and Hong Kong have taken the same measures, so the Macau government must cooperate.</p>
<h3>International Gold Price Issue: IMF Notifies Member States to Prohibit Price Increases</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] The International Monetary Fund announced today that it has notified 44 member states to find ways to prohibit the international market price of gold from exceeding US$35 per ounce.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Prices Continue to Tighten</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was buoyant, with demand exceeding supply and prices rising across the board. Although the market was closed for one day during the Dragon Boat Festival, off-market trading prices had already risen. Yesterday, prices continued to tighten, especially for white sugar, rising by as much as 10,000 to 120,000 yuan. At the guild's closing, Peruvian sand warehouse receipts reached a high of 665,000 yuan. 24-group white was at 600,000 yuan, with warehouse receipts adding 125,000 yuan. Semi-carload free sugar rose from 555,000 yuan to 570,000 yuan. Half-carload white started at 534,000 yuan and later reached 570,000 yuan. 20 Chinese sand white warehouse receipts were at 490,000 yuan, and spot goods were at 500,000 to 523,000 yuan. Shantou was at 355,000 to 8,000 yuan. Cotton red was at 390,000 yuan, Hainan red was at 358,000 yuan, and high-quality Diaoging was at 320,000 yuan, with the next grade at 315,000 to 300,000 yuan. A total of over a thousand lots were traded.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Peruvian sugar in the sugar market has always been used as a bargaining chip by speculators for "kick the can" trading. However, the prices of various goods in the city have recently begun to rise sharply. Stimulated by this, the sugar market has also risen sharply. Yesterday morning, Peruvian sugar even reached 635,000 yuan, a huge increase of 70,000 yuan compared to the end of last week. As a result, short sellers panicked and tried to cover their positions. However, the warehouse receipts of Xinyi Company were mostly hoarded by major players, and the amount circulating in the market was decreasing daily. Therefore, it was impossible to cover positions in time, and disputes arose due to failure to deliver on time. Trading in the market was temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3>Silk All Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the artificial silk market stopped rising and fell back. 120 High Mountain Guang opened at 22.8 million yuan. Due to the extraordinary tightness of credit, there were few takers, and prices could not be sustained, falling to 2.5 million yuan. After a transaction, it fell again to 2 million yuan at the close. In the afternoon, there were many who took advantage of the low prices to buy in, so there was a slight rise. Finally, the selling price was 22.4 million yuan, a drop of slightly more than 1 million yuan compared to the previous day. 75 Golden Rooster semi-gloss, the asking price reached 32 million yuan the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the market asked for 30 million yuan, but no transactions were made.</p>
<p>The factory silk market also showed slight weakness yesterday. The opening price for D-grade was 30 million yuan, with five dan traded, a drop of 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day's asking price. There were no transactions for the other grades, and the asking price was also about 500,000 yuan lower. The transaction price for small lot silk was similar to the previous day. High-grade small lot Double Tiger brand was priced at 30 million yuan. There was no news of dry warp trading yesterday, and the asking price did not fluctuate much.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk goods market also declined due to credit conditions. Dachen surface traded at 11 million yuan, and Huaqiang Bei warehouse receipts opened at 10.08 million yuan. The final asking price was 10.9 million yuan. Dachen Geli Bi Zou opened at 41,200 yuan and traded one ticket before falling back. Transactions were also made at 40,600 or 700 yuan. Later, upon hearing that the stock market was down, there was a greater need to sell off. At the lowest, it once entered within the 40,000 yuan mark, finally maintaining 40,000 yuan at the close, with a difference of 200 or 300 yuan on the next day. Hua Jin Zou's selling price was also slightly inferior due to the decline in raw materials. High-end goods traded at 21,000 yuan. Transactions for the other goods were very quiet, so the selling prices were mostly firm and unchanged.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Rise Sharply, Fall Quickly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market was in a state of rapid advance and rapid retreat, with Wing Tai and opening up Jia, Yi, Bing three cards of Great British, Old Knife, Great South Rice, Great Three Cannons and Turkish and other various cigarettes. The Great New Tobacco Company also dispatched Special Jia, Yi, and Bing three cards of Standard Brand cigarettes. The market chips were suddenly abundant, and there were also resales, so the asking prices retreated rapidly. The final price for ten Great British cigarettes was 6.75 million yuan, a sharp drop of 900,000 yuan compared to the afternoon before the festival (the 22nd). Old Knife brand fell by 850,000 yuan, to 5.8 million yuan. Hardeman fell by 600,000 yuan, and Five Hua only fell by 50,000 yuan. The overall trend was that the factories increased the distribution of goods, and the authorities denied the wind that foreign exchange adjustments were taking place. Market sentiment was lax, buyers were watching, so the other Chinese merchant cigarettes also fell across the board. However, American goods such as Six Horses, Maurice, and Camel cigarettes were quite firm, rising by 1,500 yuan to 4,500 yuan. The sales of Listening Head cigarettes were sluggish, and each carton fell by 500 yuan to 4,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal Market Gradually Turns Around</h3>
<p>The prices of Lao Long white coal and Chenxi bituminous coal and other coals have continued to rise in the producing areas, and transportation costs have also increased, while local market prices remain sluggish, with the gap between the two being too large. Most customers are holding onto their shipments in the warehouses, and will not sell them unless they are at a good price. As a result, sentiment has turned firm, and the entire coal industry market suddenly saw a turnaround yesterday, especially with bituminous coal rising the most, and sales of coke and white coal also expanding greatly.</p>
<h3>Industry and Commerce World, Issue 6, Published</h3>
<p>The sixth issue of "Industry and Commerce World," published by Pan Shihao and edited by Yuan Baili, was published yesterday. The contents include a special feature on "Should the Government Open Foreign Exchange," as well as Pan Shihao's "Ways to Resolve Labor Disputes," and several behind-the-scenes news articles. The price is set at 3,000 yuan per copy.</p>
<h3>Intense and Tense: The Political Climate in the Capital</h3>
<p>— Nanjing, 16th, Quick Report by Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>In September of the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945], I took the first ship from Chongqing to the two capitals [Nanjing and Beijing]. At that time, this capital was visibly scarred by the iron heel of the Japanese occupation. Japanese soldiers were scattered throughout the streets, and many tall buildings were still occupied by the Japanese. The streets were riddled with potholes, and the few small cars and sparse pedestrians made one feel the desolation of the post-war capital. In October of the same year, I went to Nanjing from Shanghai again. The shops on Xin Jie Kou, Zhongzheng Road, Zhongshan Road, Taiping Road, and other streets were still mostly sealed off, and the potholes in the streets were still mostly unpatched. Only the Confucius Temple on the Qinhuai River remained abnormally prosperous, with people gambling and making noise outside the taverns. In December, I went to Nanjing again on business, but although more shops had opened on the bustling streets, I still felt it was large but impractical. More than a year later, I returned to Nanjing with empty feelings. Before arriving in Nanjing, my mind was filled with the impression of the post-war capital's desolation.</p>
<p>Traffic Control is More Orderly</p>
<p>The capital now welcomes the returning traveler who cares about her with a different appearance. The potholes in the streets have been filled, many dilapidated houses have been repaired, shops are neatly opened, and public buildings have also been renovated. In particular, cars on the roads are lined up like long snakes, driving back and forth in an orderly manner. One car follows another in such an orderly fashion, much better than the chaotic traffic in Shanghai. Perhaps the number of cars in the capital is not as many as in Shanghai, and the road mileage is longer than in Shanghai. However, for someone who previously had empty feelings towards her, now feels fulfilled.</p>
<p>The Political Atmosphere is Extremely Tense</p>
<p>The capital now has an atmosphere reminiscent of Chongqing, the wartime capital. It is tense and enthusiastic, even though it is a time when people generally advocate a low profile due to both foreign and domestic troubles. That is how I feel. I was in Nanjing precisely when Xinjiang was being invaded by Outer Mongolia. Colleagues in the press were busy and extremely nervous. The whereabouts of the Minister of National Defense became a new interest for our colleagues. Therefore, they were too lazy to go to the Director of the Information Bureau's "sesame seed cake meeting." They controlled all means of transportation and used all possible methods to obtain news about how the authorities were handling this foreign invasion.</p>
<p>Determined to Resist Aggression Despite All Difficulties</p>
<p>I asked them about their opinions on the current situation based on the guidelines I occasionally saw in political circles. They believed that "the administration must be reformed, but it must start from the upper levels. The current few powerful families should be punished, otherwise it will not gain the trust of the people." They believed that the reasons for the Outer Mongolian invasion were complex, and the attitude of the Chinese Communists was so strong that it required determination, perseverance, and the elimination of fear and hesitation to make the situation clear with a firm will. Yes, this statement represents a progressive force, and this force is dominating the tense and enthusiastic situation in the capital today.</p>
<p>The Nerve Center Must Not Be Relaxed</p>
<p>Now, the people of the whole country are suffering. The capital is the nerve center of the whole country, and it should make a decision. We must be strong and not weak. We must make further efforts and not allow any relaxation. Today's capital has transitioned from post-victory desolation to tension and arduousness. The work before us is to eliminate domestic troubles, solve foreign problems, and strive for construction. This is really no different from the difficulties of the war of resistance. However, ordinary people believe that since victory has been achieved, they should enjoy themselves, indulging in enjoyment. Production has not progressed, consumption has increased significantly, and prices have soared, leading to an unprecedented economic crisis. All these symptoms have increased the burden on the government. I feel that prices in Suzhou are lower than in Hangzhou, and prices in Nanjing are even lower than in Suzhou, perhaps because, as the capital, there are better ways to control prices.</p>
<p>The Rustic Charm of a Village Girl on Xuanwu Lake</p>
<p>Mr. Xiong Fuxi asked me in Shanghai to meet him in Nanjing and then go sightseeing together. That was the second day after I arrived in Nanjing. It was raining heavily. When we arrived at Xuanwu Lake, the boatmen had not yet put up the awnings. We called a boatman, who quoted a price of 30,000 yuan. We bargained down to 20,000 yuan and made the deal. In the whistling wind, we went around the lake. To the right, we could see Zijin Mountain in the distance, and to the left rear were the towering walls of Stone City. In the center of the lake, there is a Xuanwu Lake Park, which is very large. In the lake, reeds grow densely in clumps. I asked Mr. Xiong, "Which is more beautiful, West Lake or Xuanwu Lake?" He said, "West Lake is like a refined lady, while Xuanwu Lake is like a village girl. Look at the clumps of reeds, the few lotus leaves in the distance, and the huge city walls reflected in the lake, all indicating that she is a village girl." I said, "If Xuanwu Lake is used as a scenic area, of course, there is nothing wrong with that, but if you want people to be able to live in the scenic area, then West Lake is the choice."</p>
<p>The Brocade of Jinling: A Small Flower Adorning Xuanwu Lake. It is just a small flower adorning the brocade of Nanjing, while West Lake is a nest of flowers. Therefore, I talked with many people in Nanjing and said, "Nanjing should be the political capital, Shanghai should be the economic center, and Hangzhou should be the city of culture." They all agreed. Moreover, some people said, "Isn't that right? Hangzhou will establish two national public schools to emphasize this city of flowers." However, today the government is busy with its affairs, and important matters are waiting to be dealt with. How can they have time to plan and build a city of culture? The capital is indeed struggling in distress, expressing enthusiasm and tension in its form. We hope that this enthusiasm and tension will affect the whole country and push the whole country onto the road of construction.</p>

<h3>The Mystery of the "Chinese Pyramid"</h3>
<p>— Xi'an, 15th, Airmail News by Our Correspondent Zhang Xianzhou</p>
<p>An American pilot said that he discovered the "Chinese Pyramid" this spring in a place fifty to sixty miles south of Xi'an, and that there is also a small temple on the tower... That is what the telegram said. Once this news spread, everyone asked each other, where is the Chinese Pyramid? What does it look like? Why haven't people in Xi'an ever discovered this "large building" in the northwest? A series of questions were raised, and the Chinese Pyramid became a mystery.</p>
<p>The American pilot's remarks seem to be true, and it is also true that the people of Xi'an do not know. At that time, the reporter interviewed many "old Chang'an" people, but they mostly talked vaguely and reached no conclusion. It was not until two months ago that the newspaper published, "The pyramid south of Xi'an mentioned earlier is a mistake for Guishan Mountain in the Qinling Mountains. Guishan Mountain is located south of Xi'an, and the mountain shape is like the character '圭'...etc." A few days ago, the reporter went to the southern suburbs of Xi'an on business. It turns out that the "Chinese Pyramid" is not Guishan Mountain, but "Jianshan Mountain," which is more than ten Chinese miles west of Guishan Mountain.</p>
<p>Brown Earth and Green Trees</p>
<p>Traveling southwest from Xi'an, the plains stretch for thousands of miles, the Zhongnan Mountains are in sight, villages and towns are quickly passed, and the sounds of chickens and dogs are heard from time to time. The brown earth and green trees have a unique flavor.</p>
<p>After passing Qindu Town (Qindu Town is the location of the large sluice gate of the Fenghui Canal), there are more paddy fields, and willows surround the roads near the rice paddies, full of "Jiangnan sentiment." At this time, you will see many mountain peaks standing among the treetops, all appearing blue in the distance. Among these many mountain peaks, there is a lower mountain peak that forms a regular equilateral triangle, with a small temple on top. This is the one that is recognized as the "Chinese Pyramid"—Jianshan Mountain.</p>
<p>Sheer Cliffs</p>
<p>Jianshan Mountain is located more than fifty kilometers southwest of Xi'an and belongs to the territory of Feng County. The north side of the mountain is a sheer cliff, with no way to pass. However, the south side is not too steep. People who climb the mountain climb up the stone steps and vines from the South Mountain Road. It is more than five thousand meters high. Compared to the other mountains connected to it, it is a "younger" peak, but from the perspective of "danger," most of the other peaks are not comparable to it. The reporter and four others filled a pot of boiling water in a village at the foot of the mountain and bought more than a dozen eggs before setting off uphill. The mountain is made of stone, with no dripping water or large trees. There are only some mountain flowers, weeds, and Chinese medicines such as Chaihu and Yuanzhi. Now is the season of lush grass and blooming flowers, so the scenery is obviously beautiful. Reaching the top of the mountain, we climbed to the small temple. There are several trees next to the door. The temple consists of two main halls and two side rooms, enshrining statues of gods that have been slightly blackened by smoke. Looking north from behind the temple, the Wei River is like a belt, with a network of roads crisscrossing. Looking down the mountain, there are cliffs covered with vines, which are chilling.</p>
<p>Outward Transportation of Mountain Goods</p>
<p>To the east of the foot of the mountain is Taipingkou, one of the sources of the Feng River, with mountain roads leading to Ningxia, Shiquan, and other places. It is a small outlet for "mountain goods." Loads of "fire paper," wood ear, and lacquer are transported from the mountain outwards. It is said that the prices of these goods are very low in the mountains, but because they cannot be transported out and the transportation costs are too high, the cost of transporting them after "export" can be more than ten times higher. China's inconvenient transportation means that many materials cannot be used, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>Harvest in Guanzhong</p>
<p>After going down the mountain, the reporter asked an old man, "What was 'Jianshan Mountain' called in ancient times? What god is worshipped on the mountain?" He said, "It's just called Jianshan Mountain, and the mountain god is worshiped. That's all! I don't know..." We talked to him about this year's harvest. He told me a lot. In general, this year, the wheat in various counties in Guanzhong was mostly affected by "black smut" (i.e., black ear disease). The situation was serious in some places. Generally speaking, the areas west of Xianyang in Guanzhong had a more abundant harvest than last year. The harvest in the areas east of Chang'an was not as good as last year.</p>
<p>A Mountain Road</p>
<p>At the foot of the mountain, there is a mountain path leading west along the mountain. The locals call this road "Shenxian Road" (Road of Immortals). It is said that when Tang Sanzang went to "the Western Heaven" to obtain scriptures, he took this road. Although no one has walked on it for a long time and it is overgrown with weeds, people do not bury the road. Who says that the common people do not have a sense of nostalgia for the past?</p>
<p>About ten Chinese miles east along Shenxian Road is the Caotang Ancient Temple, which was the former residence of the famous monk "Kumarajiva" during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. It is also one of the "Eight Scenes of Shaanxi" during the Tang Dynasty. It is said that at that time, there was a well in the Caotang Temple, and every morning smoke came out of the well and flew to Chang'an, circling the city three times before disappearing. Some people say that it was "auspicious air," so the "Caotang Mist Closely Connected" in the Eight Scenes refers to this. When we went to see the ancient well, it was just a broken well, already collapsed, and there was really nothing to see.</p>
<p>Four Treasures of the Temple</p>
<p>However, the Caotang Temple still has its "four treasures," which can still be boasted in the major temples of Guanzhong. These are (1) Kumarajiva's Relic Pagoda, commonly known as the "Eight Treasure Jade Pagoda," which is about eight feet high. It is made of jade, has five layers, and is carved with patterns. The workmanship is quite exquisite and seems to be an "antique" without a doubt. (2) Guifeng Stele, this is a Tang Dynasty stele written by Pei Di, a friend of Wang Wei, and topped by Liu Gongquan. It has been rubbed by stele rubbing artisans for generations, and the characters have lost their sharp edges and are covered with broken marks. This stele is quite valuable among the rubbings in Chang'an. (3) History of Buddhist Transmission, about four feet high, recording the major monks and celebrities related to Buddhism from the Han Dynasty to the late Qing Dynasty. I think if anyone wants to study the history of Chinese Buddhism, the ancient temples in the southern suburbs of Xi'an should have a lot of information. (4) Smoke and Mist Well, that is, the broken well.</p>
<p>Decline in Incense Offerings</p>
<p>Where is the "Chinese Pyramid"? In the southern suburbs of Western Capital, in the prosperous area of ancient China ("Guo Du Scenic Area"). However, it was not built by people, but is natural. It is not an accumulation of locust stone strips, but a single block. There are few tourists from afar here. There are only mountain visitors and old farmers, who occasionally go to the mountains to collect herbs during their hard lives. It is said that in these days of continuous warfare, the number of people burning incense is not as many as in the past.</p>
<p>Last year, when Li Xiannian's troops of the Chinese Communists disturbed the Qinling Mountains, Jianshan Mountain once donned military attire. Many bunkers were built in the villages around the mountain. Although the banditry has now been suppressed, Jianshan Mountain still has its new mission in maintaining peace in the Qin Zuo area.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Cotton Fields</h3>
<p>— Poyang, 15th, Airmail News by Our Special Correspondent Yu Ningpo</p>
<p>In Jiangxi, cotton is mainly produced in the alluvial lands around Poyang Lake, including Jiujiang, Hukou, Duchang, Poyang, Yugan, Leping, Fuliang, and other counties, where the area planted with cotton is relatively large. Jiujiang borders Konglong Township in Huangmei County, Hubei Province, and is a well-known cotton-producing area in Jiangxi Province. According to estimates by the China Cotton Mill Association, the combined production of the two provinces is about 300,000 dan. According to the association's estimates, the average cotton production in Jiangxi Province from 1919 to 1923 was 426,677 dan; in 1925, it was 807,000 dan; in 1927, it was 597,730 dan; and in 1929, it was 304,100 dan.</p>
<p>Area and Production</p>
<p>Jiangxi Province is located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, with rivers and lakes along its borders. The soil and climate are most suitable for cotton planting. The average cotton field area in the province is about 290,000 mu. According to the Jiangxi Economic Commission's estimate in 1933, the province had a total of 350,036 mu of cotton fields, accounting for 0.84% of the province's total cultivated land area. The counties with the most cotton fields were Gao'an and Hukou, each with more than 45,000 mu, followed by Jiujiang with more than 34,000 mu, Yongxiu with more than 32,000 mu, and Duchang and Fuliang with more than 20,000 mu each. Poyang, Yugan, and Yiyang each had more than 10,000 mu, while other counties had anywhere from several thousand mu to hundreds of mu. In 1935, the total area of cotton planted in the province was 378,674 mu, an increase of 280,000 mu compared to 1933.</p>
<p>Although more than 60 counties in the province plant cotton, because Jiangxi Province has always been the richest rice-producing area, most farmers are more inclined to plant rice in fertile land and are not very interested in planting cotton. In western and southern Jiangxi, either because the soil and climate are unsuitable, or because even dry land that is not suitable for rice planting is often converted to plant other crops. Their understanding and habits are only to strive to increase the production of miscellaneous grains and to underestimate the importance of cotton planting. Their labor is only to put in one point of effort and get one point of return. They do not pay attention to studying how to improve the soil or transplant newer agricultural techniques suitable for the soil.</p>
<p>The province's cotton production was about 70,000 dan in the past. According to a survey in 1935, the cotton field area in 29 counties of the province was 199,740 mu, and the total cotton production was 42,481 dan. In the recent eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, due to the impact of the enemy's invasion, famine, and agricultural production, cotton production has declined even more. The planting area and lint cotton production increased in the three years from 1941 to 1943, while the rest decreased. The following table lists the province's cotton field area and lint cotton production from 1937 to 1945:</p>
<p>Year | Cotton Field Area (Municipal Dan) | Lint Cotton Production (Municipal Dan) | Comparison with 1937 | Increase/Decrease Percentage</p>
<p>[Missing values from table]</p>
<p>Excluding 1944 which had no statistics, the increase compared over the seven years totaled 24.800 municipal dan. In the early three years of the War of Resistance, the average annual decrease was about 30 percent. From 1941 onwards, there was an annual increase, with the largest increase in 1942, reaching 85.6 percent. Although there was a decrease in 1945, it was only a decrease of 10 percent.</p>
<p>Quality and Sales Channels</p>
<p>Most of the cotton seeds in Jiangxi Province are of the Huamian variety, and many are named differently depending on the region, but in reality, many different names share the same variety. For easy distinction, there are three types: white seed, black seed, and smooth seed. Among them, Hukou, Pengze, Yongxiu, and a few other counties plant American cotton. Yongxiu's American cotton is of the "Tuozhi" variety, and the harvest results are still good. Most of the counties belong to the "Zhongmian" variety, and the best quality is Hukou's white-seeded cotton, which is the best variety of cotton in the province and has a considerable position among the domestic Zhongmian grades. What the Shanghai and Wuhan markets call Jiujiang cotton belongs to this cotton. Its special characteristics are strong development and high production. The yield of seed cotton per mu is consistently above 120 jin, or even 200 jin. However, because the fiber is short and coarse, it is not suitable for the needs of the times. Apart from this, most of the cotton production in Jiangxi Province is low. In recent years, the cotton field area and production in Leping, Fuliang, Dexing, and other counties in the upper reaches of Poyang Lake have increased compared to before the war, and the cotton quality is also quite good. Because there was very little cotton imported from other ports during the War of Resistance, the raw materials for inland handicraft cotton spinning were all supplied to the safe areas in the rear. As the value of cotton increased, planting became more prevalent. Therefore, the production of crops sometimes shifts according to environmental needs, and the past and present become opposites.</p>
<p>Because of its poor quality, most of Jiangxi cotton is used for cotton wadding for clothing and bedding in the province and for the inland handicraft textile industry. The surplus for export is only from Jiujiang, Hukou, Pengze, Yongxiu, and other counties. The export quantity is only half of the production volume, and half of this was previously absorbed by the Jiuxing Yarn Factory in Xunshi. According to the Jiujiang Customs' statistics on Jiangxi cotton exports over the years, the largest was in 1930, totaling 70,809 dan, and the smallest was in 1920, totaling 466 dan. In 1931, it was 21,699 dan, and in 1932, it was 10,338 dan. In 1933, it was 22,072 dan, which is less than one percent of the cotton export volume of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei and other provinces.</p>
<p>Increased Production and Improvement</p>
<p>Before the war, the Jiangxi Office of the National Economic Commission, in view of the decline in the production and sales of Jiangxi cotton, formulated a plan to promote cotton planting and gradually implemented it. The measures to promote production include: (1) Improving cotton seeds, establishing cotton improvement farms, creating cotton seeds of superior quality and quantity, conducting regional trials separately, and using the "Tuozhi" American cotton in the Xiushui River basin and Hukou's white-seeded cotton in other counties. (2) Expanding cotton fields, selecting high and dry land that is not suitable for rice cultivation to convert to cotton planting. In the northern Jiangxi counties suitable for cotton planting, cotton planting must be compulsory, with each county increasing to at least 400,000 mu of cotton fields, creating northern Jiangxi as a broad cotton-producing area in the province. (3) Cooperative production and sales, with the cotton improvement farm assisting local organizations to form cotton production and sales cooperatives, providing seedling loans for cotton production, and directly selling to various yarn factories.</p>
<p>Regarding the development of textiles: (1) Establishing yarn factories in three phases, each phase lasting three years, to complete the establishment of 200,000 yarn spindles. Yarn factories will be established in Jiujiang, Nanchang, Ji'an on the Gan River, Hekou on the Xin River, Nancheng on the Fu River, and Yichun on the Yuan River in phases. The fineness and coarseness of the yarn and the number of yarn spindles will be appropriately allocated according to the quality and quantity of cotton produced, so that the textile industry in the province will develop evenly. (2) Promoting hand-weaving, with the Cotton Industry Improvement Committee purchasing 10,000 wooden looms and distributing them to rural cooperatives for use by women in various places. Saving labor and reducing costs. (3) Establishing bleaching and dyeing finishing factories, with a dyeing factory established in Nanchang specifically for the use of local cloth in various places.</p>
<p>Last year, the cotton production in Jiangxi Province was generally considered to be a good harvest. However, the area and production volume did not increase significantly. The cotton seedlings in the northern counties did not grow well due to excessive rainfall in the summer. After autumn, the weather was arid, and the late-stage development of cotton was greatly hindered, which was slightly less than the initial estimates. However, the area of ​​cotton fields in the inland slightly increased, which can be described as a good harvest compared to normal years.</p>
<p>Recently, the provincial government, concerned about the decline in cotton production in the province, plans to promote the use of high-quality cotton seeds starting this year. The Huazhong Cotton Production Improvement Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will allocate Dezi cotton seeds and equip them with machinery to prevent insect pests. Hu Jingliang, a supervisor of the Ministry of Agriculture, came to Jiangxi from Hubei last winter to inspect cotton production and conducted thorough discussions with the Provincial Agricultural Institute. For this year's production increase plan, the Agricultural Institute also decided to actively promote the breeding and management of American cotton, and quickly plan to restore the Yongxiu cotton farm and expand the Hukou cotton experiment farm to improve cotton seeds. In the future, due to market needs, the cotton fields and production in Jiangxi Province may be able to promote the possibility of increased production.</p>

<h3>Dunhuang Art Exhibition: The Motherland's Precious Treasures Bring New Understanding to Taiwanese Compatriots</h3>
<p>— Taipei 14th Dispatch, Our Reporter Yang Yu</p>
<p>"Dunhuang Art" has become a specialized term in today's art field. It is the greatest and richest artistic treasure that our motherland has left us. Bringing these achievements of our ancestors to Taiwan Province, which had been separated from the motherland for over fifty years and had only recently been recovered, for a public exhibition is more practical and effective than instilling any sense of motherland consciousness. Here, it can tell Taiwanese compatriots, whose understanding of the motherland's geography may be vague: that as far back as fifteen or sixteen hundred years ago, when the rest of the world was still mired in darkness, ignorance, and chaos, our ancestors were already creating such brilliant and outstanding art in the Dunhuang grottoes. Moreover, these were merely created by artisans.</p>
<p>Wall Paintings and Sculptures: Famous Works from the Six Dynasties and Northern Wei</p>
<p>The exhibition features nearly one hundred works, all copied by Mr. Pan Jiezi, a researcher at the Dunhuang Art Research Institute of the Central Research Academy, from the Mogao Grottoes of Dunhuang and the Yulin Grottoes of Anxi in the thirty-fourth year. To enhance the understanding of Taiwanese compatriots, a large map illustrating the eastward spread of Western culture and the blending of Chinese local art in Gansu's Dunhuang is displayed at the entrance of the venue. In this way, the reporter heard people softly asking at the venue: Where exactly is Dunhuang located in China? The origin of the Mogao Grottoes is also briefly explained in words here. "The ancient Yangguan road connects to Tianzhu (India), bordering Buddhist countries as neighbors. Monks joyfully come with alms bowls, stepping into the singing sands of Dunhuang." These are the opening four lines of Gao Yihan's "Song of the Dunhuang Grottoes." According to research, as early as 353 AD, grottoes began to be built here, the grotto walls were plastered with red clay, and sutra transformations (Buddhist sutra transformations), stories (records from Buddhist sutras), Bodhisattvas, illustrations, and patrons of the Buddha were painted. There were also Buddhist statues and sculptures. The earliest art from the Six Dynasties and Northern Wei dynasties reached the peak of perfection. Therefore, the most preserved works are from this period. The works from the Song and Yuan dynasties are covered in layers. It is said that several layers of works from different eras can be peeled off from the grotto walls.</p>
<p>Mogao Grottoes Inscription: Evoking Infinite Yearning</p>
<p>Many visiting Taiwanese compatriots lamented that we had not been able to properly preserve these national treasures. For decades, the Hungarian Stein, who acted as a spy for the British, spent only five hundred taels of silver to buy nearly twenty boxes of essential scriptures from Wang Yuanlu, a Taoist priest in Dunhuang who had begged for alms. These scriptures were sealed in a mud cave by Song Dynasty monks when they fled the Western Xia invasion, and they were shipped to London. The French professor Paul Pelliot followed suit and returned with a full load. By the time this art shocked the world, we, the descendants, could only shamefully inherit about seven thousand rolls of incomplete books and paper scraps. One Taiwanese compatriot asked me: "Can't we negotiate to get them back?" I blushed and gave him a bitter smile!</p>
<p>What intrigued the Taiwanese compatriots was a Mogao Grottoes inscription from the eighth year of the Yuan Zhizheng era, with six languages: Han, Hui, Mongolian, Tibetan, Xixia, and Sanskrit. It illustrated the strength of that dynasty and evoked endless emotion and yearning.</p>
<p>Many visitors happily compared it to last year's provincial art exhibition as they looked at it. The works, which were full of Japanese flavor and lacked the simplicity and profound techniques and innocence, finally received an evaluation today. The magnificent and dignified Buddhist statues of the prosperous Tang Dynasty, the skilled lines of the Zhu Dynasty, and the well-structured styles of the Yuan Dynasty wrote a brilliant history in painting techniques that could look down upon the world's history.</p>
<p>Hair Styles of Prostitutes: The Japanese Imitate</p>
<p>Prostitutes of the Tang Dynasty who abandoned their lowly status and became virtuous were also patrons and were painted on the walls. Their hair styles were almost the same as those of Japanese prostitutes seen in today's pictures. In storybooks, several children were dressed in overalls and collarless shirts, similar to the currently popular Hong Kong shirts. These details elicited knowing smiles from the visitors.</p>
<p>Copying is not an easy task. The damaged parts need to be repaired, the missing parts need to be filled in, and the blurred parts need to be carefully copied. Mr. Pan said that he sat in the dark cave facing these faded wall paintings for a whole year. Although it was a belated effort, these works still show the nobility and greatness of the motherland, which has earned the author the most comforting reward. In particular, it is these treasures that can give Taiwanese compatriots who have returned to the embrace of the motherland a new understanding and a new harmony today. This joy does not belong to the reporter alone!</p>
<h3>The Yellow River Flood Area: Swords or Jade and Silk?</h3>
<p>— Zhengzhou 14th Dispatch, Our Reporter Fan Shiqin</p>
<p>Some say that Greece has become a testing ground for the world's two major opposing systems. Then we can say: Our Yellow River flood area is actually a testing ground for settling disturbances with construction instead of force. There are still some communist troops there disturbing the local area. The government has already made up its mind: to rebuild this Yellow River flood area. In this reconstruction, will "swords turn into jade and silk" or will "jade and silk turn into swords"?</p>
<p>The refugees of the Yellow River flood area have been wandering for ten years before returning to their hometowns. Their feelings of sorrow and joy are self-evident. Now, the tens of thousands of refugees who are returning must first have a place to live and something to eat. If they want to eat what they grow or build houses with the sorghum stalks they harvest, then they must first have seeds to sow. If they have seeds to sow, they must have farm labor and livestock to help them cultivate. They have nothing and must start like primitive people.</p>
<p>From the Yellow River flood area, one can jump onto the Jinpu Railway to the east, the Longhai Railway to the north, and the Pinghan Railway to the west. It is located within the triangle of these three railways, making it convenient to enter and exit, which is rare in other parts of China. In the past, that area was the granary of the Central Plains, especially the grain produced in the areas of Qixian, Taikang, Huaiyang, and Suixian was particularly abundant. It is said that seven years ago, Huaiyang County alone produced four million dan of wheat per year, while Suixian County could produce 300,000 dan. Just in terms of cotton, Suixian County alone produced more than one million jin, and counties like Weichuan, Tongxu, Qixian, and Taikang all produced a large amount of cotton.</p>
<p>In order to cultivate cotton and wheat agricultural products, experts from the United Relief Headquarters hope to use tractors for large-scale cultivation and have conducted trials in Huaiyang and other places. According to those experts, it is not difficult to train farmers to use tractors, because they can first teach the students of the Henan University Agricultural College, then teach some high school students, then teach some primary school students, and finally the farmers will naturally also be able to use them. What they feel is difficult is that farmers have too little land ownership. For example, in Huaiyang, more than 50% of farmers have a maximum land ownership of only ten mu. For land used in such a scattered manner, it is simply impossible to use large-scale tractors for cultivation, rendering them useless. For this, those experts hope that farmers in every six or eight villages will cooperate to use tractors. If this is done, it will form a kind of collective farm. The Yellow River flood area is, in this regard, another testing ground for a new society.</p>
<p>From an industrial point of view, the Yellow River flood area needs to establish textile factories, flour mills, and oil presses (because the Yellow River flood area produces a large amount of peanuts and sesame), and on a smaller scale, brick and tile factories, shoe factories, mat factories, etc., for self-sufficiency. Regarding the former large-scale factories, the designers advocate establishing them in Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, because these two places can use the coal from the Anyang, Jiaozuo, and Jixian areas as fuel. Zhengzhou is currently opening the first stepping stone for the future industrial construction of the Yellow River flood area, which is the preparation of an agricultural machinery manufacturing company with a capital of 2 billion yuan, of which the first phase of 1 billion yuan has been raised. It is said that this company can also manufacture tractors, so there is no need to import them from foreign countries.</p>
<p>In the Yellow River flood area, most of the young people in their twenties are illiterate. The education problem is very serious. There, the land is occupied by snakes and lizards, and people are plagued by fleas, lice, insects, and poisons. To this day, we have not heard an educator or hygienist discuss the education and health problems in the Yellow River flood area. The revival of the Yellow River flood area is not only a matter of agriculture and industry, but also a matter of education and hygiene that cannot be ignored. Since the government is determined to rebuild the Yellow River flood area, it is naturally unnecessary for the reporter to worry about these two aspects.</p>
<p>Everyone will doubt whether this Yellow River flood area can be rebuilt. For example, the United Relief's relief supplies are always becoming the target of communist looting. Then, in the future, while you are building, they will be destroying. Will your construction be successful or will their destruction be successful? If we truly admit that there can be no construction under destruction, then we must deny the fact that construction projects to block the breach were completed before the destructive raging floodwaters. Now, the few communist leaders scurrying around in the Yellow River flood area, like Lou Fengming and Jin Shaojiu, are all from the Yellow River flood area. Almost all of their subordinates are local people. If the construction work in the Yellow River flood area is done conscientiously, even if the communist leaders remain stubborn, their subordinates will feel that there is a broad road for them to take and will naturally break away from their leaders. In this way, destruction will bow before construction. Swords will turn into jade and silk. The reconstruction of the Yellow River flood area is small in the sense of rehabilitation, but great in the sense of settling disturbances with construction instead of force.</p>

<h3>Teaching Field</h3>
<p>— Hong Weifa</p>
<p>Kuang Zhouyi's "Selected Lane Miscellany" contains Yan Tingzhong's "Good Words of Yangzhou," set to the tune of "Looking South at the River," one of which says: "Yangzhou is good, taking a walk in the teaching field after a midday nap: a three-foot cloth stall talks about fate, four foreign mirrors reflect amorous feelings; caged crows compete in new songs." This is the scene of the Yangzhou teaching field in the late Guangxu years of the Qing Dynasty. Based on what the author saw in his childhood, the writing can be said to be lifelike.</p>
<p>The location of the teaching field belongs to the new city. People from the new and old cities who go to the teaching field are generally called "going down to the teaching field." This word "down" is very special. In the author's childhood, every time he heard the words "going down to the teaching field," he felt a special sense of intimacy, because the teaching field was the place where children liked to linger the most.</p>
<p>Around the teaching field, in the past, there were almost only teahouses and noodle restaurants. Among them, there were also some elegant names, such as Cherishing the Remaining Spring, Emerald Green Spring, Jing Le Yuan, and Nine As Sitting Arrangements. These teahouses and noodle restaurants were places where adults gathered, but not playgrounds for children. What made the teaching field a playground for children was that there was a large open space in the center of the teaching field. In this open space, there was almost everything from food to play.</p>
<p>As far as the author can remember, many candies were made while being sold, such as peanut brittle, sesame brittle, and ginger candy. The children would watch the candy being made first, and only after a pot of candy was made would they take out money to buy it. They would eat a few pieces themselves and also bring a few pieces back. In the hearts of the children, it seemed that eating the candy that they watched being made had a different flavor than just being sweet, and they would feel a different kind of pleasure.</p>
<p>In addition to candy, the places selling insects, fish, flowers, and birds were also very popular with children. Insects were most abundant in summer and autumn, such as stinkbugs, golden crickets, katydids, and crickets. Children could buy and buy again along with bamboo cages, paper boxes, and mud pots. Goldfish were available except in the dead of winter. Most of them were very small. For these, the children could buy several at a time, happily showing off. In terms of flowers, herbaceous plants were the most common, because the price was not high. After the children bought them, it was fine if they withered. The parents would not make things difficult for them. In addition, birds such as larks and thrushes were expensive, so children could only stare at them with appreciation, but they could also buy a few small sparrows to feed.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, there were also those who ran horses to sell tricks and those who performed acrobatics. A group of people shouting "Rely on parents at home, rely on friends when out," "Rely on the mountain to eat the mountain, rely on the water to eat the water," and "Those with money throw money, those without money help out the scene," those so-called Jianghu people also gathered in the teaching field. Although the children didn't have money to throw, they would help out the scene, circling and drilling around the elbows and armpits of the adults on the scene, and their joy was boundless!</p>
<p>As for the "three-foot cloth stall talks about fate" mentioned in "Good Words of Yangzhou," there were actually different types such as character analysis, face reading, fortune-telling, marriage matching, as well as Wenwang divination, Diliuren, and even yellow bird holding cards, etc., scattered in various parts of the teaching field. The children didn't know about fate, but they were very curious, so they often gathered around the yellow bird holding cards. There were also many who wanted to see foreign scenes. Village girls and commoners liked them, and children also liked them. The so-called "four foreign mirrors reflect amorous feelings" was that the paper had one or two secret pictures, which those who wanted to see foreign scenes used to seduce the audience. After seeing them, the commoners were flushed with excitement, the village girls were red-faced, and the children had a sudden expression, but they couldn't openly talk about it. As for "caged crows compete in new songs," the children could only watch. Because the caged crows that competed in new songs were relatively noble. Those who showed off these relatively noble caged birds in the teaching field must be members of gangs in order to avoid being bullied. Originally, there were two types of bird viewing: muffled cages and bright cages. Muffled cages only had one side exposed, and this was available to ordinary people. If it was a bright cage, with no barriers on all sides, and they were not members of a gang, then someone would say, "Friend! Let me see it!" and snatch it from his hand.</p>
<p>Since the teaching field was changed to a vegetable market, many of these scenes have changed. White iron sheds are built on the open space, separated by rooms, which looks much neater, but loses some natural interest. Every day, most of the people coming and going are housewives buying fish, shrimp, vegetables, and fruits. Recently, passing by there occasionally, recalling the old clear scenery, it is truly lamentable!</p>
<h3>Beethoven and Salieri</h3>
<p>— Oriental Mist</p>
<p>In 1823, "Music Sage" Beethoven wrote a letter to Salieri, saying: "I respect your work more than all other theatrical works. Every time I hear one of your new works, I am intoxicated, and my interest in it is greater than in my own works. In short, I respect you and love you... You have always been the one I respect most among my contemporaries, and if you would give me the immense honor of writing me a few words, that would be very comforting. Art unites people, especially true artists, and perhaps you would be willing to count me among these people." As it turned out, Salieri never replied to this letter.</p>
<h3>Eccentricities of Writers</h3>
<p>— Peeping Through a Tube</p>
<p>The American literary giant Mark Twain liked to wear white clothes in winter.</p>
<p>The American writer Hawthorne always washed his hands before reading his wife's letters.</p>
<p>A certain Hungarian novelist and playwright refused to write without using purple ink.</p>
<p>The English writer Farrer wrote all his works standing up.</p>
<p>It should be said that a ghost always followed him.</p>
<p>The French poet Lantree dyed his hair green, claimed to eat human flesh, and lived with snakes all day long.</p>
<p>Shelley folded important letters and hundred-yuan bills into small boats and threw them into the river.</p>
<p>The Englishman Carroll wore black gloves in the summer and wrapped everything in his suitcase separately when traveling.</p>
<p>Dumas only wrote novels on blue paper, only wrote poetry on yellow paper, and wrote short essays on rose-colored paper. But he did not use blue ink.</p>
<p>Despin Lasafa spent many hours every day catching spiders.</p>
<p>The Italian poet D'Annunzio took an umbrella to London and taxed over there very much.</p>
<h3>Songs of Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mingchun</p>
<p>Recently, in the "Local Teaching Materials of Taixian" compiled by Shu Rongsong, I found the following two folk songs:</p>
<p>One,</p>
<p>The sun rises in the east, yellow and bright,</p>
<p>Village girls are busy in the fields;</p>
<p>Flower shoes are taken off on the bank,</p>
<p>Pants are rolled up to transplant rice seedlings.</p>
<p>Two,</p>
<p>Coming early in the morning,</p>
<p>The dew is heavy,</p>
<p>I see my sweetheart off on the road;</p>
<p>My flower shoes are wet from running,</p>
<p>How can I go home to see my in-laws?</p>
<p>I lied in front of my in-laws,</p>
<p>Saying I went to the fields to check the rice seedlings:</p>
<p>The early rice fields lack water,</p>
<p>The late rice fields have more weeds,</p>
<p>The soybeans have many empty shells,</p>
<p>The sesame fields have many sparrows.</p>
<p>The in-laws smiled happily,</p>
<p>Truly a good housewife.</p>
<p>Reading these two folk songs, it is as if reading the folk customs in the Book of Songs, making people feel fresh, lively, and full of wild interest. Compared with the works of cultivated poets in the city, it is like comparing a healthy village girl with a city beauty, and one always feels that the latter is too made up and loses its naturalness.</p>
<p>The second one is particularly lovely, and I think there is also an important factor, which is that it can combine labor and love. In order to explain it, it may be helpful to compare it with two famous Hakka mountain songs. One,</p>
<p>Washing vegetables by the pool,</p>
<p>That dear brother is quarrying stones,</p>
<p>If you want to take a vegetable,</p>
<p>You love your sister, come to feed her at night.</p>
<p>Two,</p>
<p>The moon sets over the mountain step by step,</p>
<p>Younger sister carries water out of the riverbank,</p>
<p>A silver coin is secretly dropped into the sister's bucket,</p>
<p>Instructing the younger sister not to bolt the door.</p>
<p>Washing vegetables and carrying water, blended with flirting and secret appointments, clearly shows the shamefulness and odiousness of those young masters and young ladies who do not engage in production but appear as love experts.</p>
<p>The author has a particular fondness for the two Taixian folk songs mentioned above. Indeed, what they praise is the peaceful scene of the northern Jiangsu countryside before it collapsed, at least the prosperous era of the early Republic of China. Now, singing them slowly in a low voice, it is as if one is in a paradise, faintly hearing the chickens and dogs of the village, enough to temporarily forget reality and enjoy a moment; it not only evokes the scenes of childhood rural life. It is a pity that today's farmers are in no mood to sing this light tune.</p>
<p>From the early Republic of China to before the Anti-Japanese War, the countryside was bankrupt, and farmers could not live in peace and work, so they had to "lightly" move to the city, especially Shanghai, to make a living. After mixing around, they could only maintain a minimum animalistic life, so they sang this bitter short song:</p>
<p>Shanghai is good to make money,</p>
<p>It's been many years since I left,</p>
<p>I want to go home,</p>
<p>But I don't have travel expenses!</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, the people of northern Jiangsu, in addition to being deprived of all human rights, also had to pay grain and miscellaneous taxes to the various governments, so they specialized in singing, no, crying like this:</p>
<p>The captain slapped his gun,</p>
<p>The district chief bought fields and built houses,</p>
<p>The township chief ate big fish and big meat,</p>
<p>The village head wore colorful clothes,</p>
<p>The common people cried loudly in pain!</p>
<p>Here, it should be added that what the common people hated was not specifically the above-mentioned people. They had already listed the enemy and traitors in the "super hate" list, regarding them as tigers and wolves, and disdaining to vent their anger with folk songs. Who has ever found a folk song that hates tigers?</p>
<p>In the period approaching victory, many middle and lower-class families were unable to make a living due to the exploitation of being sucked dry, so they had to exchange their daughters' chastity and happiness for survival. When many rural girls married or were hired by the small leaders of the armed classes, the following songs that were both tearful and funny were produced.</p>
<p>The girl married the captain,</p>
<p>The family finally has someone to support them;</p>
<p>The girl followed the conscription soldier,</p>
<p>It really made the old mother heartbroken.</p>
<p>After the victory, northern Jiangsu suffered even greater disasters. They lived a life of seeking death but not being able to get it in the gunpowder and bloody air. Even if there was a Li Youcai II who was good at writing songs, I am afraid he would have no leisure to create. Moreover, even if folk songs appeared that could observe customs and know the gains and losses, people with numb hearts and wooden spirits—in fact, they didn't listen at all—would think that they violated the traditional poetic education of gentleness and honesty.</p>
<h3>Articles and Prices</h3>
<p>— Zhongqi</p>
<p>A female reader who admired a certain famous novelist visited the writer for the first time. After she looked around his house, a kind of disappointment that could not be concealed appeared on her face.</p>
<p>"Is something wrong?" the host asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," the woman admitted, "the house you described in your writings is so magnificent and grand, I don't understand why you live in such a humble place yourself?"</p>
<p>"Dear friend," the novelist replied, "Unfortunately, the value of articles is not as expensive as the price of goods!"</p>
<h3>Open a Canal to Make Statues for Me, Write Bamboo to Repay</h3>

<h3>Remembering "Literary Friends"</h3>
<p>— Xiao Kangshi</p>
<p>Sixteen years ago, it was a prosperous period for supplements in major newspapers in Shanghai. At that time, Zhou Jichen, Chen Liang, Zhou Tianyu, Wu Chengda, and the author, etc., more than a dozen people, often wrote for the "Spring and Autumn" and "Local Supplement" of Shen Bao, "New Garden Forest" and "Local Supplement," "Tea Talk" of Xinwen Bao, and "Night Voice" and other supplements of Xinwen Evening News. They organized a "Literary Friends Society" and published a kind of "Life Road Weekly." The writers were all friends who contributed to Shen and Xin newspapers. In less than a year, there were more than 300 members, and branches were all over Suxi and other places.</p>
<p>"Literary Friends" took "making friends through literature" as its purpose. I remember the first gathering was in Bansong Garden in Nanshi. Afterwards, a grand get-together was made in Nanjing Hotel. After that, football matches and excursions were also held.</p>
<p>Since the "August 13th" cannon fire invaded Shanghai, the members of the "Literary Friends" society did not communicate with each other for eight years. At the beginning of the victory, there was a small narrative. On the 22nd of this month, it was the second expanded gathering after the victory. The location of this gathering was the "Lianyi Club" in the Nanyang Shopping Mall. More than 30 guests and members, including Zhan Duhe, Yu Kongwo, Guo Yongxi, Feng Ruomei, Zeng Yan, Han Jingqi, Zhou Jichen, Chen Liang, Zhu Zhensheng, Zhang Mengfei, Rui Hongchu, Zhu Tingyun, Mu Yilong, Zhang Shizhou, and the author, etc., more than 30 people, after ten years of war, the members were scattered, and the world was vicissitudes, which is not a false statement.</p>
<p>The meal was "clean and refined" Sichuan cuisine. Mr. Duhe gave a speech during the banquet, using "clean and refined" to enlighten our "Literary Friends," deducing the "clean and refined" of articles to the "clean and refined" behavior of literary friends, and his words were very alarming. Secondly, Mr. Guo Yongxi and Kongwo Han Jingqi and other gentlemen delivered speeches. Zhang Mengfei and Fan Wencai, two gentlemen, played storytelling and performed an opening chapter on the spot; there was also Zhou Sheng's Kunqu opera, Zeng Yan's humor, and Jing Anbang's magic, all of which won endless applause.</p>
<p>After this dinner gathering, "Literary Friends" decided to restore the organization, and the correspondence address will be set up in the Feibao Newspaper Office. Under the "remaining life of sorrow and hardship," to learn from each other and discuss the "bitter classics," in order to seek cleanness and refinement, is also a happy event in life.</p>
<p>[Editor's note] People engaged in literary writing and those who love literature tend to easily become friends. One reason is that there is a common tendency in spirit, and the other is that mutual understanding can be increased from the works. The era of "women despising each other" should have passed. Especially from the war to the present, the status of writers in society has not only deteriorated, but also their lives have become increasingly difficult. When the Shanghai Writers Association was established, I also said "Works are not divided into new and old, thoughts are not divided into left and right, styles are not divided into Jing and Hai, and ages are not divided into old and young." We must communicate and cooperate harmoniously. We must also follow Zhuangzi's so-called "When the spring dries up, the fish live on land, giving each other moisture with saliva," being friendly and united, and helping each other from unity. Today, reading Mr. Kangshi's manuscript, I am delighted to hear that "Literary Friends" has restored the organization, and will seek clean and refined behavior from the clean and refined articles. As well as the recent establishment of the Chunniao Poetry Society, these are all gratifying things in the literary world in Shanghai. I specially add a few words to express my congratulations.

<h3>A Writer Praised by Tolstoy</h3>
<p>— Eastern Mist</p>
<p>Count L. Tolstoy, the author of the monumental work "War and Peace," was by nature quite eccentric and at times an arrogant man. However, among his contemporary writers in the same country, there were many whom he appreciated. For example, he had high praise for Chekhov's short story "The Darling." Furthermore, in his diary, he wrote: "Every great artist must create his own form; if the content of art is infinitely diverse, its form is also like that… We remember all the good works in Russian literature, and their forms are entirely original. As for Gogol, it goes without saying; even take his 'Dead Souls,' what is it? It is not a novel, nor a story, but something entirely original. Then there's the best work written by Turgenev—'A Sportsman's Sketches'; Dostoevsky's 'The House of the Dead' and 'Childhood'; Herzen's 'A Family Drama'; and Lermontov's 'A Hero of Our Time,' and so on."</p>
<h3>Two Prose Pieces</h3>
<p>— Zhong Ling</p>
<p>Lamp</p>
<p>Are we heading towards dawn?</p>
<p>Now that the dim torch has shed its last tear, darkness begins to constrict around me. My warmth, the comfort of my soul, will be consumed in this lonely and desolate night. I dare not try to draw back the azure curtain with trembling hands, because outside the window, there is a darkness woven from gloom and emptiness, upon which hideous faces are floating; here, there, greedy tongues are stretching out!</p>
<p>Is the wind blowing through the woods the howling of ghosts? Is the rustling of falling leaves the weeping of ghosts?</p>
<p>Ah! I am afraid.</p>
<p>I have lost the lamp, I have lost the light. Is the night still long?</p>
<p>What to do? ——</p>
<p>Thinking that the lamp will conquer the darkness of the night, bolstering the infinite courage of the lonely…</p>
<p>Thinking that the lamp will sweep away the cold and desolation around, giving me warmth, giving me a sense of comfort…</p>
<p>Thinking that the lamp will reveal the original faces hidden in the darkness, giving me solace…</p>
<p>Like a martyr piously offering his life for his belief in truth, I expect that goodness will have a bright lamp.</p>
<p>Pillow</p>
<p>I once loved the dreams of summer, I once loved this bridge of dreams.</p>
<p>Like the delicate fragrance of lilac, like the tenderness of a bee’s stinger, so softly and skillfully it unveils the brocade box of my daytime fantasies. …</p>
<p>After all, with a pillow, I have no worries. It encourages my energy for the struggle of life; it constantly reminds me that there is a very clear boundary between joy and pain.</p>
<p>From then on, disregarding the hideousness of darkness, the desolation and loneliness of night, slowly, step by step; a delicate fragrance, a tender emotion, brings comfort to my heart.</p>
<p>I often depart from the noise of the city and go to this bridge of dreams to retrieve the fragments of my lost youth. When I look up, I see the inexplicable depression in my heart, incessantly flowing towards the riverbed of a tranquil blue sky. I have never been hurt by any curses or resentments in the world.</p>
<p>So many countless long nights, I quietly embrace the vast storehouse of distant thoughts, throwing myself into the embrace of this dream, gently, blessing it for its eternal youth and companionship with me.</p>
<h3>Jottings on Reading Songs</h3>
<p>— Xiao Zao</p>
<p>(1) Waves Beat Stone City</p>
<p>Liu Yuxi's preface to his "Five Poems on Jinling" says: "'The mountain gardens and the old kingdom are all around; the tide beats against the empty city, returning in loneliness. The old moon east of the Huai River still passes over the parapet in the deep night.' Bai Juyi shook his head and chanted sorrowfully, contemplating it for a long time, and said: The poem on Stone City says, 'The tide beats against the empty city, returning in loneliness.' I know that later poets will not be able to add a single word."</p>
<p>The line "Tide beats against the empty city" is appreciated by songwriters and used extensively. Yuan Dynasty writer Dou Eci Jin Yao wrote about ancient times: "Listen to the deep night, the loneliness beats the isolated city, the spring tide is swift." The application is superb, making it popular and well-known.</p>
<p>Also, Wu Meicun's "Linchunge Genealogy: Madame Xian Mobilizes for Royal Affairs" says:</p>
<p>"Don't think about the mountains surrounding the cold old palace, the tide beating against the empty city, the blood of the cuckoo choosing the southern branches directly below. It's just that I stand in the west wind, scratching my white hair, only able to cry towards the horizon, entrusting my heartbreak to the crying crows. Who faces the fallen flowers at the river's edge? Ah, my eyes, unable to see the Stone City carriage, ah, my tears, unable to sprinkle on the cultivated pines and junipers, only year after year, autumn moon and sorrowful bugle."</p>
<p>Compared to the line "I was originally the chickens and dogs of Huainan, not following the immortals to return to the human world," it is even more moving.</p>
<p>(2) Chang'e's Grievance and the Book of Han</p>
<p>Guan Hanqing's Yuan Dynasty Zaju play "The Injustice of Dou E, Moving Heaven and Earth" has already been listed as one of the world's famous tragedies today. Operas and theaters have staged it many times, and translated works are especially numerous. The "June Snow" story circulating among our people is adapted from one or two plays about Dou E's grievance, but the vulgar language loses too much of the truth. Guan's original work has excellent dialogue and can be called a masterpiece. There is a passage that says: "Don't say that I am reciting the deceased daughter to reduce her sins, but it is only pitiful to see the three years of great drought in Chuzhou Prefecture. In the past, Yu Gong once defended the filial woman of the East Sea, and indeed it was that which evoked the spiritual rain like a spring. How can it be shirked off by saying that natural disasters have always existed? Don't you think that the people's intentions can communicate with heaven? Today, re-correcting the documents, it shows that the laws of the King do not allow the people to be wronged."</p>
<p>Checking the "Filial Woman of the East Sea" in the Former Book of Han: "There was a filial woman in the East Sea who was widowed early and had no children. She cared for her mother-in-law very diligently. Her mother-in-law wanted to marry her off, but she refused. Her mother-in-law told the neighbors, saying: 'The filial woman cares for me diligently. I am old and have long burdened the young men.' Then she hanged herself. The daughter of the mother-in-law told the officials, saying: 'The wife killed my mother.' The officials examined the matter urgently, and the filial woman falsely confessed. The entire case was submitted to the prefect. Prefect Chu ordered the woman to be killed. The prefecture experienced a three year drought. Later, a new prefect went to the tomb of the filial woman and personally sacrificed, and the heavens immediately poured down heavy rain, and the crops ripened." The Later Book of Han, Bi Mao's biography, says: "In the past, the filial woman of the East Sea suffered injustice and was killed unjustly. Her wronged spirit moved and transformed, and the heavens responded with drought." Although such consciousness is very corrupt and backward and not worth mentioning, it can be seen from this that most of the stories in ancient scripts were based on records.</p>
<p>(3) Zhao Yi (Oubei) Did Not Write Plays</p>
<p>During the Qing Dynasty, there were many cultural composers, including Hong Sheng, Kong Shangren, Jiang Shiquan, Li Yu, and Huang Bianqing, among whom were particularly noteworthy. Only Zhao Yi (Oubei) did not compose. In the "Oubei Poetry Collection" there is a poem that says: "Unable to bear the idleness, some advise me to write miscellaneous dramas to pass the time, but I am old, how can I do this cunning thing? I refuse."</p>
<p>"Middle age is easy to be sentimental, so I should use silk and bamboo to dispel the fleeting time. How can I bear the flowers and the moon, Zhang San's shadow? I composed Zhao Wuniang on the pipa myself. Luo Yin had three generations of mutes, and Guo Men Gao died in the end.</p>
<p>Only Wang Mingtang Kaiyuan remains, leaving a clear fragrance on the battlefield."</p>
<p>It is permissible for literati not to write plays and novels, but to take Shi Nai'an and Guo Men Gao as warnings is unavoidable, as if eating one millet and being punished by a hundred beating is like Han Yu's ambition to be a historian. (Note: Guo Men Gao was the pseudonym used by Emperor Zhuangzong of the Later Tang when he appeared on stage in court dress.)</p>
<h3>Rambling Musings on Solitude</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>Milton said:</p>
<p>"Where no hope is left, is left no fear." From this sentence, I thought of another poet who said that hope and fear are inseparable. There is no one who hopes without fear, nor one who fears without hope.</p>
<p>We might as well let go of the threads of our thinking and gallop through our past life experiences, and we will believe the above sentence without reservation.</p>
<p>Prejudice often causes suffering between people.</p>
<p>However, to completely remove subjectivity, that is, to completely remove prejudice from conversation or writing, is both unnecessary and absolutely impossible. It is just like there being no absolute vacuum in the world.</p>
<p>The American biographer Emil Ludwig's view is correct. He said that we read Xenophon's and Tacitus's greatest historical works about their own times precisely because we find them fascinating because of their prejudices. There is a big difference between personal views and partisanship. Only writers who transcend partisan feelings and interests can have fair arguments.</p>
<p>People will have different choices for everything. The attitude of taking or leaving implies one's own prejudices. The so-called objectivity has its own considerable limits.</p>
<p>Kant's so-called Critique of Pure Reason, in my humble understanding, is not too simple a question.</p>
<p>The impossibility of absolute objectivity is just like we cannot put our soul into the body of the blue sky.</p>
<p>Therefore, Sologub's interpretation of neo-realist literary works is not merely simple realism, but must contain the writer's sharp criticism. Naturally, these criticisms cannot follow popular opinion in order to seek objectivity.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that prejudice is not a bad thing. The problem is whether it can leap over the fence of selfishness. If one can think more for the opposite side for five minutes, this so-called prejudice will not mislead the world.</p>

<h3>Casual Chat of a Train Person, Part One</h3>
<p>— Train Person</p>
<p>Editor's note: "Train Person" is one of our contributing writers. Because he does not wish to reveal his real name, he is publishing under a pseudonym. Readers should take note.</p>
<p>For the past few months, due to my profession, I have had to travel back and forth on the Beijing-Shanghai line almost every week. This short journey of more than 300 kilometers would not have been complicated, but after traveling back and forth three or five times, I realized that I was almost daily related to the Beijing-Shanghai train line. For example—</p>
<p>Sunday, I take the train from Nanjing to Shanghai, using a ticket that I obtained from the office three days earlier.</p>
<p>Monday, in Shanghai, I start preparing for my ticket back to Nanjing.</p>
<p>Tuesday, the ticket back to Nanjing is in my hands.</p>
<p>Wednesday, in Shanghai, I jump on the night train back to Nanjing.</p>
<p>Thursday, I arrive at the Xiaguan train station in Nanjing in the morning.</p>
<p>Friday, in Nanjing, I start preparing for my ticket back to Shanghai again.</p>
<p>Saturday, the ticket to Shanghai is in my hands;</p>
<p>If I continue to travel back and forth between Beijing and Shanghai, the above seven days of actions will have to be repeated…</p>
<p>What kind of life is this—hence some call me "Train Person"—however, 26 years ago, it was only necessary to buy a round-trip ticket between Beijing and Shanghai once a week to be considered "all under heaven is peaceful"!</p>
<p>The name "Train Person" is not too awkward, and because I have become a "Train Person," all kinds of things related to trains naturally leave a particularly easy impression; now I will temporarily record some of them below.</p>
<p>A Polish Person</p>
<p>On one occasion, a Polish person sat with me and said that he had been in China from Warsaw for nearly half a year and was very satisfied with the equipment on the Beijing-Shanghai line. The European railways he had recently traveled on could not compare to the Beijing-Shanghai line. This kind of national diplomatic speech at least did not make me feel uncomfortable; but later when I talked to him about his journey from Poland to China, I learned that the European countries he had recently passed through were Romania, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Italy, and Poland. Of course, the European railways he had recently passed through were also the railways of Romania, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Italy, and Poland. So "cannot compare to" and so on, whether it was diplomatic speech or not, was really enough to make one taste it carefully!</p>
<p>Answer the Name · Increase Salary</p>
<p>A month ago, the employees of the Beijing-Shanghai line asked passengers for their consent to increase fares in order to increase salaries. According to reports, more than 10,000 passengers have signed their approval for the price increase. We should express our sympathy and seek to raise the low salaries of the employees, but it is said that the Beijing-Shanghai line has about 50 million passengers every year. If the above-mentioned "more than 10,000 people" is correct, then this number compared with "50 million people" is inevitably a percentage that is close to ironic!</p>
<p>Fortunately, this problem was soon resolved by the state allocating subsidies, saving social statisticians from having to XY it!</p>
<p>Dust and DDT</p>
<p>The weather is hot, and mosquitoes and bedbugs are out. For travelers, this is certainly an unpleasant thing, at least! But the Shanghai and Nanjing newspapers reported half a month ago that the authorities of the Beijing-Shanghai line use DDT every day to disinfect the passenger cars. Good news! Good news related to national health! I think this must be truly a well-deserved message, especially since it is the holy product of the golden ocean ally. The spirit of service of the railway authorities is really remarkable. All in all, several tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of gallons of DDT must be used every summer. From then on, the national health will inevitably have a new good atmosphere!</p>
<p>But it must be said that the spraying of DDT is probably carried out in the passenger car's "maintenance field" (please forgive me for borrowing the term from the highway), and it is difficult for us people boarding at the station to witness it, but what we witness is the cleanliness of the car. The dust and dirt in the third and fourth class cars are all over the floor, chairs, and even walls, so there is no need to publicize it much. Even in the first and second class cars, the dust is only transformed into ashes but still exists. The railway authorities do not seem to have any news of dealing with this dust and dirt. Perhaps this is the misfortune of mosquitoes and bedbugs but the good fortune of dust and dirt. Otherwise, perhaps the golden ocean allies have not yet developed magic medicines and tricks to remove ash and dust, so the railway authorities have nothing to draw on or imitate!</p>
<p>Clean Water and Electricity Categories</p>
<p>This must be said again: I think "water" is something that should be available in every country, everywhere, and the method and equipment for preparing "water" in passenger cars should have long been familiar to the railway authorities or their subordinates. Of course, this does not require the invention of the golden ocean allies. However, in the passenger cars of the Beijing-Shanghai line, only one of the third and fourth class cars has water, and almost half of the first and second class cars have no water. So although both ends of the car have that ashy black little washbasin and a seemingly half-dead little "faucet," it is difficult to find a spoonful of clean spring water to wash off the mixture of ash and sweat on the hands of the passengers, or to wash off the "blood plasma" left on the hands of the passengers by mosquitoes and bedbugs!</p>
<p>This may be said to be negligence on the part of the car, but their non-negligence is placed elsewhere. For example, the electric lights in any passenger car, they never forget to save money, so the electric lights are so few that passengers can only distinguish how many finger joints they have on their hands at night, while the sleeping cars are as bright as day. Also, for example, meals, they never forget to try their best to increase the price, so the meals are more expensive than any restaurant in Shanghai, while the portions are less than any restaurant in Shanghai. A large part of their plan is only to teach passengers to be hungry, not to teach passengers to be full—however, the people in charge of this kind of plan are public servants who manage the railway for the country! Perhaps none of this has anything to do with national health, in the calculations of these public servants!</p>
<p>Reasons for Increasing</p>
<p>Recently there was another thing that came out of their calculations that was even more incomprehensible. On June 17, various newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai published the news that "railway prices will increase by 200%," and the reason for this increase was:</p>
<p>In recent months, the expenditures of the Yinlu and Postal Bureaus have increased daily, and the losses have been increasing daily. The income of the two lines (Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou) in April was about 26.2 billion yuan, and the expenditure was about 32.1 billion yuan, resulting in a deficit of about 5.9 billion yuan, and the losses in May were even more than this number, so the price increase is inevitable.</p>
<p>We slightly pick up our passenger's abacus and tap it, and we find that once this increase is implemented, then the number of 26.2 billion belonging to income will not be difficult to immediately become 78.6 billion, in other words, it is "turning one into three," but then, for the sum of 32.1 billion belonging to expenditure, I don't know what the public servants of the railway bureau can calculate in their calculations! I think that in the commonly used general calculation method, the price index should of course be used as the basis for calculating the increase or decrease. The basis for the railway's special calculation method is of course not something that we passengers can guess, but in general terms of prices, if the three times the income from the actual price increase is used to offset the number of expenditures, it is obviously more than enough, so why increase the price to 200% at once!</p>
<p>So "price increase is inevitable" and so on is inevitably just the railway authorities' "belly scripture." Although it is not necessary to immediately call it a hammer on the passengers' heads!</p>
<p>With my experience as a train person, I close my eyes and think: In the past two or three months, the railway authorities have promoted a lot of "belly scriptures" to society!</p>

<h3>"The Sword and the Lute"</h3>
<p>— Shi Feng</p>
<p>If you are a lover of the violin or classical music, then I believe that "The Sword and the Lute," which is currently showing at the Majestic Theatre, will give you great satisfaction. You can carefully appreciate it, whether in the script, acting, or music.</p>
<p>"The Sword and the Lute" not only tells us the story of the rise to fame of the world-renowned violin virtuoso Paganini, but also deeply points out that great and sincere love cannot be forced by money and status. It is an immortal faith and inspiration that grows forever in the fields of love. If Paganini had not met his lover, Jenny, his achievements in music might not have been as brilliant as they are today. Of course, the encouragement and assistance of his manager, Jimmy, was also one of the reasons for his success; but it was only Jenny who inspired him to muster the courage to devote himself to playing. For her sincere and close love, he could sacrifice everything to duel with his rival in love—Paul. Although he was not a swordsman, the fire of love burned fiercely in his heart, making him bravely gamble everything for his destiny!</p>
<p>Stewart Granger, the handsome leading man who played in "Sorrowful Jones," perfectly portrays Paganini's stubborn, decisive, and passionate character. Many violin performances are presented in graceful poses. His facial expressions depict the different emotions revealed in his heart, whether it is sorrow, anger, hatred, or passion. As for Phyllis Calvert, who plays Jenny, she also achieved success in acting. I believe that many viewers will be moved by her extraordinary acting skills. She portrays Jenny's infinite joy and passion when the love that has long been planted in her heart for Paganini suddenly erupts very sincerely and deeply. Later, under the control of cruel fate, she had to say goodbye to Paganini. At that moment of soul loss, she asked him to play a piece for her. So, in the plaintive, weeping, leisurely, and desolate violin music, she left Paganini with a heart full of resentment, disappointment, sadness, and attachment that could not be expressed! She loved him, and the violin was her life, how could she leave him!</p>
<p>However, sincere love is immortal. At the concert in the Vatican, Paganini played the piece from their separation again. Jenny could no longer bear it. She felt that only his violin music could exist in her heart forever. Money and status are just fleeting clouds. Sincere love is eternally valuable. She finally threw herself into Paganini's arms again.</p>
<p>The behind-the-scenes performance of modern violin master Yehudi Menuhin contributed to the musical success of the film. His technique is worth appreciating.</p>
<p>This is a film worth seeing, even seeing again. I would like to recommend it to all those who love music and pursue true love.</p>

<p>"No, he did it himself," Tom said honestly.</p>
<h3>American Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Xu Yuan</p>
<p>Why Does Swimming Have to Be in a Pool?</p>
<p>Upper-class Chinese people living in Shanghai feel the lack of swimming pools. Going to Gaoqiao to swim seems too far. The swimming pools in the city that are privately run are small and expensive, and if there are too many people, they are not very hygienic. In the United States, there are places to swim in every city, but they are not limited to swimming pools. Most are on the banks of streams. Some have the banks slightly piled up, becoming like swimming pools. Some are simply natural, with green grass and lush thanks wood, embellished with red and green swimming suits, which is much more beautiful than artificial swimming pools. In southern cities such as San Antonio, Austin, and the San Marcos River cross, there are places to swim everywhere. Local residents choose places where the river channel is relatively neat and the river bed is relatively flat, build diving platforms, and build cold drink rooms on the shore, which becomes a swimming pool, and swimming tickets can be sold in the same way. The fountains in the park usually accommodate children swimming. Since the pool is not deep, there is no need for lifeguards. There are still plenty of public gardens in Shanghai, and some have the beauty of vast lakes and algae. It seems that the existing ponds can be slightly modified to make them swimming pools. The municipal authorities spend very little, and it is of great benefit to the health of the citizens. With Shanghai's dense population, 20 or 30 swimming pools are not enough to meet the needs of the citizens. Since summer is approaching, our wise municipal authorities, who have high and bright garden villas to escape the heat, I wonder if they have ever thought of the ordinary people who are huddled in attics and between ten compartments? In the United States, the common practice is to pay 25 cents for swimming each time, which is 7,000 or 8,000 yuan at the black market rate. Calculated by 1% of Shanghai citizens, the income is quite considerable. Using this to repair the swimming pool has more than enough surplus, and it will definitely not affect the municipal budget. Merchant ships sailing the sea still have deck swimming pools. Modern cities, how can they not have them! (2)</p>
<h3>The Death of Ji Kang—One of Miscellaneous Essays on Figures of the Wei and Jin Dynasties</h3>
<p>— Zhou Leng</p>
<p>Historians have always described the figures of the Wei and Jin Dynasties as uninhibited and affected. Kang was naturally one of them. His "Letter of Severance with Shan Juyuan" contains a passage that is a perfect self-description:</p>
<p>"I was orphaned early, seeing my mother and elder brother in distress. I didn't delve into the classics, and my nature is lazy. I don't wash my head and face for fifteen days a month, and I don't mind much, being unable to bathe. I often urinate and can't bear to get up, only getting up when my bladder is slightly full. Moreover, I have been indulging for a long time, my anger and arrogance are unrestrained, simplicity is contrary to propriety, laziness and slowness have become my nature, yet I am lenient with my friends and don't attack their faults."</p>
<p>When he offended Zhong Hui and was falsely accused and sentenced to death, Chen Shou also wrote about him vividly: "As Kang was about to be executed in the Eastern Market, he looked at the shadow of the sun, took the zither and played it, saying: 'In the past, Yuan Xiaomin often followed me to learn Guangling San, and I always cherished it. Guangling San is now lost forever!'" From life to death, he was always unrestrained and unconventional, so it's hard to avoid such criticism.</p>
<p>However, when viewing the ancients with modern eyes, the advantage is that we are far removed from them, and gains and losses are irrelevant, so our views are not biased and our arguments are more fair. But the disadvantage is that we are too far removed from them and often cannot feel the era in which they lived, imagining ourselves in their position from all sides. As a result, we inevitably miss the point and fail to discover the true meaning of the facts. The Wei and Jin periods were notoriously chaotic and dark. In half a lifetime, the dynasty changed twice. The higher-ups openly usurped power on one side, while using various excuses to cover up their crimes on the other. The lower-downs were busy fighting for power and profit on one side, while preventing others from intervening on the other. The literati with conscience had no choice but to feign madness and be cynical with a heart of sorrow and pain, self-anesthetizing themselves with medicine and wine, and using the method of "speaking about other things" to avoid attention and pass the long, dull, dark days.</p>
<p>The "Difficult Times" chapter of the Outer Chapters of Baopuzi says it well:</p>
<p>"Those who exhaust their integrity without concealment can be employed. But if you want your words to be accepted and your body and mind to be at ease, you must wait for the right time. In times of adversity, treacherous and evil people are jealous of what they cannot achieve, suppressing those above and below, hating the upright and disliking justice, fearing the impartial attacks on evil and injustice. Therefore, they strive to eliminate those who surpass them, to relieve their resentment... So that those who practice the art of cherishing life, on the contrary, incur the crime of immediate death, and those who offer plans to pacify the emperor, instead suffer the calamity of endangering themselves. Therefore, it is said that it is not the difficulty of speaking, but the difficulty of speaking out."</p>
<p>The Kang Zhuan says: "Wang Rong himself said that he lived with Ji Kang in Shanyang for twenty years and never saw him show joy or anger." It seems that Ji Kang had long been mindful of his own cultivation, but unfortunately, his cultivation was not sufficient, and he offended the powerful with "What did you see when you came? What will you see when you leave?" and ended up with a death sentence.</p>
<p>Ji Kang, one of the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove, died an unnatural death. Talking about wild and strange things and offending others, Ruan Ji was even worse than him. Talking about disregarding propriety and indulging in his own desires, Liu Ling and the others were not inferior. Why did the autocratic axe fall on his neck alone? According to my speculation, it was probably because he had no backstage support. The Ji Kang Zhuan says: "At first, Kang was poor, and he and Xiang Xiu forged iron under a large tree to support themselves." Naturally, those who bully others always start with those who are easy to bully. Liu Ling and the others didn't have his great reputation, but Ruan Ji had a great general backing him up. He had no special connections, but he refused to buy anyone's account. As a result, he was naturally doomed to die.</p>
<p>Book of Jin, Volume 49, Biography of Ji Kang:</p>
<p>"Kang met a hermit, Sun Deng, in the mountains. Deng said: 'Your talent is great, but your opinions are few, so it is difficult to avoid the present world!' When he encountered the Lü An incident, he became conceited and said: 'I want to reduce my faults, but slander is rife. My nature does not harm things, but I often invite resentment. I used to be ashamed of Liu Xia, but now I am ashamed of Sun Deng. I have guilt in my heart and betray my good friends!'"</p>
<p>In fact, what Sun Deng pointed out was not necessarily entirely correct, and Uncle Ye himself also vaguely admitted it.</p>
<p>If you want to be noble and aloof, you should also have some capital!</p>
