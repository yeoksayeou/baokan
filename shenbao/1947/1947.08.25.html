<h3>魏使發表坦率聲明提供我國與革意見　政府如能厲行改革必獲民衆支持　中共果愛國應放棄武力</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕美大使館今日發表魏德邁特使離華聲明，全文如次：</p>
<p>「誠如余最初對報界聲明中所允諾者，我人已以絕無約束及成見之態度進行經濟，政治。軍事及社會情形之調査。本國全體均爲客觀及公正而努力。爲求達到此項目的起見，我人曾遍至東北之瀋陽與撫順，華北之北平·天津·靑島·濟南，華中之南京與漢口。華南之廣州·台灣，俾不致受到任何一區之特殊影響。</p>
<p>我人曾作順利之努力，獲得與各階級及各種人士接觸。我人係以彼等之經濟地位，文化收獲及不同之政治觀點而分門別類。外籍商人及官員亦曾與余會談。我人亦曾晤及政府及當地官員與各政治團體人員，其中坦白批評政府者及意見極為偏左者，頗不乏人。我人曾接獲信件二千餘，其中一小部份係匿名信。此項信件包括許多建議，使我人獲益匪淺。</p>
<p>在我人留華最後一星期中，我人之工作，主要集中於分析我人在政治，經濟及其他方面所收集之極多資料，以便獲得凖確之判斷及結論。此項意見雖各異，但有一點，則均人同此心：在動亂之中國內，中國人民咸渴望和平，早日之和平與永久之和平。余深頤能達到和平之方法，亦同樣顯而易見。</p>
<p>日本投降後，中國人民名正言順希望享受其不易獲得之勝利的果實。彼等在驅逐殘忍之侵略者努力中，曾忍受艱苦危險，並巡受不可形容之苦難。在今日之中國，我人在諸多方面所見者，乃一種漠不開心之態度，旣不設法解決問題，而以相當之時間與精力，擲於責難外來之影響或追尋外來援助。許多中國人士原極幹練而愛國，應充滿希望與決心，今者已充滿墮落之失敗主義。言之殊令人沮喪！中國雖經多年之戰事及革命之阻撓與削弱，但仍擁有大部份之資源，從事本身復興工作。中國之復興，有待於睿智之領導與夫道德與精神之再生，而此種因素，祗能求諸中國國內。</p>
<p>本人一方面充分明瞭特別指定之個人或團體的利益與問題，但一方而亦極關心中國人民整個之福利。本人深信：中共若眞誠愛國並關心本國之福利，則應自動放棄以武力達一到其思想之努力。彼等若誠意援助中國人民，則亦應以和平方式代替過去數月可悲之暴動及破壞。身居要職之　預或貪汚官員，（不特在政府組織內，在省市機構中尤甚），如能予以去除，則目前中央政府必能獲得並保留大部份民衆之一致及熱誠之擁護。此點具有同樣之重要性。</p>
<p>卓越之官員頗不乏人，彼等顯示高超之效能與息誠，並憑其低微可笑之　俸及私人合法之財產而求生。同樣的，亦有具有良心之商人，頗能遵守商業道德，但余強調貪汚或　預無能，或旣貪汚復顯預無能，而聲名狼藉官員之衆多一點，同將無人誤會也。</p>
<p>爲重新獲得並保持中國人民之信念起見，中央政府應立即重施嚴厲及遠大之政治與經濟改革。純作諾言將無濟於事，表現乃絕對必要者，武力本身決不能消滅共產主義，對於此點，應予以接受。</p>
<p>在此離華之際，本團團員以及本人，對於蔣主席及一切我人所晤及之中國愛國人士給予之援助，獲此表示誠摯謝意。承荷各方優禮相待，亦至銘感。所有美國人均祈望中國將獲得中國人民應有似已失去多年之團結，繁榮與快樂。</p>
<h3>魏德邁飛抵東京　明日赴韓作次階調查　離京前謁主席夫婦長談</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿四日電〕調査事實之　德邁將軍，於廿四日抵東京，擬於赴朝鮮開始第二階段之調査前，先與麥克阿瑟會商。魏氏於廿四日下午三時三十五分抵達羽田飛機塲，前往機塲歡迎者，有管制日委會主席席巴爾德，中國管制日委會代表商為將軍，麥帥副官彭克爾上校。</p>
<p>魏使擬廿六日赴朝鮮，將在該處勾留八日或十日。魏德邁之發言人稱，東京之行之目的，乃在向麥帥取得一項關於朝鮮局勢之要略。在作朝鮮之行後，魏德邁仍回東京小作勾留，在此以後，即返美國。</p>
<p>觀察家相信，麥帥與魏氏將討論日本在防止侵略之共產主義中所負之可能任務。據渠等指出，傳統上深懼俄國侵略之日本，或願在中日韓之反共思想陣錢中，共同合作。早有人指出，魏德邁代表團與馬歇爾對歐計劃有密切迎繫，而魏德邁亦傾向於對中國之「非共區」建議監督之援助。朝鮮正如中國然，北部區械受共黨團體支配，魏德邁之最大問題，衆料乃在計劃最好之辦法，援助南朝鮮美佔領區之人民。按朝鮮亦在麥克阿瑟指探之下。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕魏德邁及其使團一行，於二十四日晨離京飛日轉韓，到機塲送行者，有吳鼎昌（代表蔣主席），甘乃光（代表張院長），劉師舜（代表王外長），白祟禧，陳誠，翁文灝，兪大維，沈怡，桂永淸，周至柔，吳思豫，劉迺藩，凌其翰，王季徵，於斌，周　沖，潘朝英及美大使館與美軍顧問團官員等百餘人。魏氏於晨入時許，由司徒大使陪同驅車赴黃埔路主席官邸，晋謁蔣主席夫婦辭行，談話約一小時，至九時廿分抵大校塲機塲，檢閱儀仗隊並與送行者一一捏別後即行登機，九時四十五分三星座機突破雲層，騰空而去。魏使於登機之扶手梯上時，並直喚司徒之名稱：「多謝月來之協助，」更祝福而別。魏氏於萬別各歡迎人之最後一刹那，猶頻頻自機窗內揮手示意。按魏使幽自七月廿二日抵京，迄廿四日離去，共計留華一月零二日。</p>

<h3>魏使盼我肅清貪污　各方均具有同感　陳耀東稱此爲參政會向來主張　陳耀東稱此爲參政會向來主張</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕參政員陳耀東廿四日評魏德邁聲明稱，魏氏所發言論，皆爲參政會向來主張，特執行者未能採納，致我國內政有勞友邦人士再爲闡述，殊値吾人痛加反省。魏氏希臘我國能肅淸貪汚，其實整屯史治應自地方做起，蓋地方官員爲親民之官，操守若有問題，民衆將直接蒙受其害。目前貪汚遍地，賄賂公行，實有肅淸必要。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕民社黨某要員廿四日評魏德邁臨別談話稱，魏氏所言殊懇切，渠希望中國能反求諸己之意見，實與吾人向來所主張之「自力更生」相吻合。關於貪汚等點，亦為目前實情，而應急加整飭者。至中共問題，本黨主張已見共同施政綱領，易言之，仍以政治解決爲基本方針。</p>
<p>〔本報甫京廿四日電〕靑年黨府委余家菊廿四日評魏魯邁將軍臨別贈言稱，魏氏聲明中所稱「若中共確以國家幸福爲先，自當願於停止使用武力以實現其思想」。此點殊確實，其奈中共無此抱負何！魏氏希望我中央及地方咸能革新，吾人亦有此同感，蓋政治若不健全，對士氣民心皆有影響。至魏氏所稱「中國尙擁有建國所需之自然資源，故應反求諸己」，吾人非不自求努力，自圖振作，然中國經八載抗戰之後，又在長期革命禍患之中，若干方面成已失所調節，而世界安全不可分割，爲世界前途計，美國應多在建設方面多加援助。</p>
<h3>中立觀察家論美國援華問題</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿四日電〕魏德邁率直聲明發表後，使中立觀察家得到如下之結論：</p>
<p>第一，美對華大宗政治性借款之可能性，在短期內談不上。</p>
<p>第二，在美國會明年正月復會前，任何直接行動均不甚可能，蓋魏氏文告中無值得召開國會特別會議之處。</p>
<p>第三，任何財政上或軍事上對華協助，均基於蔣主席允許美國對基金供應及計劃作緊密監督及管制爲條件。</p>
<p>一般知悉，蔣主席曾親向魏使建議由美國顧問在經濟，政治及軍事各方面與中國官員合作，以打開「管制下」美國援助之門。此間觀察家相信，即此計劃亦雖受國會歡迎。</p>
<h3>司使即將赴平視察燕大校務</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕司使於魏使一行離京後語本報記者，渠將於短期內赴平視察燕大校務，主持九月八日之開學典禮。大使顯較目前略見淸　，然渠於回答記者問時，則謂月來並不過忙。渠拒絕評斷魏使之工作是否極爲成功，唯稱魏使之工作極爲辛勤</p>
<h3>送魏特使</h3>
<p>— 本報記者濮德玠</p>
<p>如果說魏德邁特使是在一陣狂熱中來中國的，那麽他走時的氛圍却是全然的淸爽、淸爽的天氣，淸爽的心情。</p>
<p>八月廿四日的早晨，初秋的爽風吹動着灰色白色的雲帆，夏天的激情已近蘭珊。大校塲上，三星座機旁邊，站滿了要走的和來送的人們，除了魏將軍由司徒雷登大使陪着去向蔣主席夫婦辭行外，上個月廿二日在塲的人們大部都在。政治顧問史浦魯斯先生和他的同伴以及六使　的朋友在拍照留念，工程顧問屈克塞爾海軍少將和抱着一頂拷克　的兪大維部長聊天，新聞顧　關華生先生接受了每一個中國記者，外國記者所　的「一路平安」，一個同業建議大家和他拍張　照，但是所有的攝影記者都集中在飛機的左　方，從儀隊的這頭望到那端地等待着。伍漢民　　（翻譯官）和甘乃光秘書長一路談着走了來。</p>
<p>着星條旗的黑色汽車來了，司徒雷發大使和魏德邁將軍先後下來，大踏步檢閱過　隊，走向歡送的人羣，接着是難以詳數的「一路平安」，緊緊的握手，誠摯的「謝謝」。一個使館的職員吻別了他的妻子走上飛機，魏將軍開始向大使館和顧問團的朋友們一個個道別，然後他又拉着司使的手低聲談了幾句，從他的表情中看得出懇切的感激。他走上了扶梯，回轉身來搖動手裏的草　。最後，銀色　漆了三道紅條的機門，遮沒了他修長的背影。</p>
<p>九點卅分，第九四一四九號三星專機，在衆人招手中滑入跑道，二十分鐘後，它強有力的四個螺旋槳，擊碎低壓的雲霾，衝入了萬里晴空，機塲上的人也都散了。</p>
<p>「在大校塲上，我們曾迎送過不少人物，……每一次迎或送，都代表着政治上一個階段的開始或結束。」但讀過了魏將軍赤誠坦白的離華證明，我們覺得這次送他並不代表結束，從他的來到走，卅三天裏不過剛把序幕揭過，他吿訴我們要做的是「與民更始」。</p>
<h3>配合總動員法令　華北各省市代表會議已擬定緊急措施方案</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿四日電〕北平行轅召集各省市代表，連日會議，已擬定一配合總動員法令緊急措施方案，俟中央批准即付實施。其要點爲：（一）加強行轅職權，對所屬各綏署省市府及駐地之中央機關，皆可便宜指揮，就地解決。（二）軍事方面，在轅統一指揮下，加強地方武力活用兵團。（三）簡化省市行政機構，裁撤田糧，社會，衛生，地政等處，及駢　機構。（四）財政上必要時得命令長蘆　務局，關　礦務局，中紡公司等國營廠附繳捐稅，以　不足。</p>
<h3>其森乘機遇難後　對日和會將展延　美在中日韓進行對蘇外交攻勢</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿四日電〕盟國對日委員會主席艾其森之遇難，將使日本和會延至十一日或十一月以後方匪舉行，世人刻成注意美海軍搜尋關於日本媾和條款之極機密文件事，然中央社記者獲悉，又其森本人實爲解決多端問題之關鍵，而美國關於此等問題之情報，猶未最後決定，雖最機密文件亦未能包括之，情報多口授，於此在佔領日本事項方面，地位僅次於麥克阿瑟元帥之不幸外交家，國務院刻必須任命一人以　文氏之職位，而繼承該職之人，復必須先行獲悉佔領最高當局擬傳達於華盛頓當局之情報及詳細意見，可能之繼任人選或屬過去，一年中代理艾氏出席盟國對日委員會及日本方面其服事務之盟軍總部外交紐副組長賽鮑爾，唯外交塲中資望及經騐頗爲重要，是以國務院中其他富外交經騐之官員，例如曾任上海美總領事現任美駐暹公使史丹頓，亦可能爲繼任人選，然艾氏之繼任人選，至少需時一月或六週方能決定。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿四日電〕據此問權威方面消息，美國對蘇之外交攻勢，目的乃在將主動權操諸於美國手中。廿四日起，已向三主要陣綫中·日·韓方面進行。此一方式之最近行動，乃爲美國重行向蘇聯對鎖太運不准國際船舶進口，提出抗麟一事見之。最近美致蘇照會，與本年一月三日致蘇者相同，惟有一點不同者，即美國率眞稱：如蘇聯拒絕遵守一九四五年八月十四日之中蘇友好互助條約，則蘇對美國在大連之美國財產及僑民應負責任。在其他兩陣綫上，美國之外交攻勢，乃在對朝鮮之蘇美聯合委員會要求　　，及率直拒絕蘇聯對日本和約應由四強起草之要求。</p>
<p>在九月中，魏德邁自中國及遠東其他部份調査返國後，美國對中國國民政府之一般政策，預料將加闡明。</p>
<p>據權成方面指出，美國諒不致改變其對華政策，而取悅於中共。美蘇關係交惡，必然引起對中共不利之反響。</p>
<h3>對日和約審議會委員人選已聘定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕外部爲草擬對日和約而設置之締結對日和約審議委會，其委員人選除由該部一部份高級職員担任外，並聘請部外對日本問題有研究之專家出任，聞聘書已發出，即將定期召開會議，開始工作。</p>
<h3>新制軍官敎育　決定八項原則</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕據軍聞社訊。新制軍官敎育，經各有關單位商討，已決定八項原則，即將開始實施：（一）提高軍官對自然科學之素質。（二）培養陸海空軍一元化之統帥與慕僚。（三）注意聯勤幹部訓練，建立統一聯勤組織。（四）加強專門技術之訓練，使一切科學之發展能應用於軍事。（五）學資與年齡及經歷配合，使學以教用。（六）經歷與學資兼顧，幕僚與隊職並重。（七）勵行招生制度，分層淘汰，以選拔優秀軍官。（八）適當培植各軍官以應動員令之需要。</p>
<h3>平津冀督導團決心懲辦貪污</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平廿四日電〕平津冀軍紀吏治督導國，經平行轅，保定綏要及各民意機關多方籌備，廿四日在平正式成立。並舉行首次國務會議，規定工作計劃，廿五日起開始工作。該國負責人表示，對懲辦貪汚具有最大決心，其貪汚有據之官吏，一經査出，決依法處理。</p>
<h3>黨員被共匪慘殺中和黨電請懲兇</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕中國中和黨爲該黨海門支部長沈希珍及總務股長施文漢，慘過共黨武裝人員殺害，特於廿三日晚召開緊急會議，一致通過致帘國府，請予懲兇，以維人權。同時並電毛澤東，追究責任。</p>
<h3>香港·在天堂之上　—南遊雜草之一—</h3>
<p>— 卜少夫</p>
<p>記者於七月廿三日自滬赴京，參加京滬同業華南訪問，一行共八人，於二十五日自京飛漢，二十八日下午乘粵漢車赴長沙，二十九日抵達，在長勾留三日，八月一日赴衡陽，二日傍晚抵達，宿一宵，翌晚離衡，中途於英德逗留四小時，五日晨九時抵廣州，九日自廣州飛海南島，十二日飛返，十四日乘廣九車去香港，十九日返廣州，二十一日搭機飛滬。此行前後計二十八日，足跡遍漢口，長沙，衡陽，廣州，海口，香港六大城市，雖旅程倥偬，不免走馬看花，然就各方所接觸而言，亦甚多可供參考硏究者，茲就個人觀感所及，將分篇記述於下，以求海內大雅君子指敎云耳</p>
<p>有這樣一則笑話：</p>
<p>「個派駐香港的英國兵，死後走近天堂，惡狠狠地敲天堂的大門，天堂管事開門出來，詢問來意，英國兵說我要進天堂。管事問，你從哪里來？幹什麽的？英國兵照實以吿。管事說：像你這樣的人，在那樣的地方，何必還要進天堂呢？」</p>
<p>香港，英國皇家人員天堂之上的所在，我們今日讀及英倫三島的生活狀况報道後，不相信這是一則笑話了。</p>
<p>抗戰勝利後兩年來，香港發生着萬千的變化，歸根結底到現在，印度獨立了，它還是大英帝國皇冠上的一粒熠熠發光的寳石，它繁榮，它有一百六十萬人口（較戰時最高的統計還多出一一十萬人），它哺養着大英帝國本土，（銀質銅質的輔幣不見了，新發行的紙質輔幣祗印一面，至於整個港幣的發行敷字，問誰呀？）它是多彩的，複雜，矛一盾的，也是怪誕的。</p>
<p>吿罷士打二樓，隨便可以遇到國內難以立足的各式不同身分的人，大規模的走私組織在活動，包運公司招攬生意，可以先付貨價百分之五十的保證金，遊資集中，僑匯集中，築成了今日香港皇后大道上的繁榮。</p>
<p>多彩的，複雜的，矛盾的，怪誕的，表現在街頭行人服裝上是刺眼的色素，那麽浮薄而易於消褪呀！表現在「香港小姐」選舉上是四個女人中選出，一個有兩個孩子的母親來，表現在一家銀行的倒閉上僅僅缺少一百五十萬港幣頭寸的週轉不靈，表現在新開紙上晚報上午十一時便滿街呌賣，表現在風化案件上兩個「拋　女朗」被拘罰的罪名是「阻击」（意指妨碍交通）。</p>
<p>我是在此次全港華人機器會所屬十三科機器工人大龍工前夕抵達香港的，那時華機會已致送最後發通牒，限資方於二十四小時內作最後答復，否則即實行罷工。十五日下午五時，通牒的時限已滿，行動開始，香港有一家晚報還臨時發行了一式　外，爲了避免刺戟，用着「第二次版」的名義，來報道此事。香港人老早便恐慌起來了，浴盆，本桶，都裝滿水，米柴油　，煤油洋燭，也大量　藏，他們或知道一九二〇年省港大罷工的一幕，或體騐了一九四一年淪陷前的滋味誰也聰明警覺，怕斷電動水斷　，一時物價爲之跳躍。米，　金錢　絲苗每石升至八十八元，黃金股票市氣大降均露低潮。</p>
<p>可是直到記者離港之日（八月十九日），水電及交通工人並未參加，香港生活並未受到致命的窒息，半島酒店的週末舞會，大同酒家的女招待，依然吸引着華洋紳士而逸興遄飛，原來香港政府的勞工司有他的錦囊妙計，而資方九龍海軍太古三大船塢等自然態度無需不強硬了。</p>
<p>要開錦囊妙計是什麽呢。那就得追究到全港各工會的組織和背景，以及水電交通等工會爲什麼沒有參加此次加薪運動的了，這問題不單純，而這不單純或許正是構成「在天堂之上」的因素之一罷。總之，十三科機工罷工的終塲，明瞭內幕的人將知道會結束於一種低微給與的。</p>
<p>商人們有苦痛的他們沾沾自喜於限前這黃金機會，他們更惶急於尋求無着一條發財之路。香港遊資充斥，銀行左款大都無息，甚至存戶還要付出手續費，而國內輸入限制的嚴峻以及結購外匯的艱難，逼使他們好像躺在鈔票堆裏挨　空嚥唾涎一般。在十七日我政府宣佈改　外匯結匯及進出口貿易辦法之前僑商曾經計劃組織一大規模營運機構，與國內貿易，採取物資交換方式，希望打開最近兩個月來香港出入口貿易的麻　狀態，現在我政府改訂的新辦法宣佈了，而中港的金融協定也快到公佈時期了，香港的商業當可稍稍趨入正軌。</p>
<p>畸形的繁榮是有其限度的，假使中國與香港之問有一道封鎖綫，別說繁榮，即使生存也還大成問題，這一點，香港政府知道得很淸楚，我們的政府更不應該不知道得淸楚。假使我們的政府知道得很淸楚了，我們在經濟方面的談判就得摒棄「外灘外交」，把這個　洞用鋼筋水泥塡　起來才是土策。</p>
<p>十三日星島“報本港新聞版上有這樣一段消息：</p>
<p>「大坑虎豹別　側，有小溪澗，溪水淸冽，常有小童聚集嬉戲。前（十一）日上午，有學童裝束者四人，至該山坑遊玩，方於嬉要問，竟有童匪數人，將該數學童之墨水筆及錢物，悉數搶去。同日下午，另有學生數人到該地遊玩，又被該批童匪強搶銀物，該數學童不甘損失，略事抗拒，竟遭童匪毆擊，乃大聲　警救助，及警察馳至時，童匪等已逃去無踪。」有個朋友—他已在州香港住了兩年了—對我設：</p>
<p>『住在香港雖够舒適，總覺得缺少一些什麼似的。」</p>

<h3>省政改革方案平議</h3>
<p>— 儲子潤</p>
<p>現行省政之缺點，盡人皆知；應加改革，已成為上下一致之要求。內政部適於此時向行政院提出省政改革方案，實在值得我們的注意。檢討一下過去省政的通弊，約言之有三：一，省的法理地位未確定；二，省政府組織　雜，運用不靈；三，省財政　經更張，基礎脆弱。所以改革省政，已成為目前最迫切的問題了。</p>
<p>今日而言省政改革，以余所見，必須　循之原則有二：一曰實行憲政之準備，以奠定省自治之基礎。一曰實施行政三聯制，以提高行政之效率。</p>
<p>第一實行憲政之準備，奠定省自治之基礎。　國民大會通過國民政府公布之中華民國憲法，既確定今後省之性質，為一高級地方自治團體，則將如何由中央代表機　之省，改造而為地方自治之省，實為當前之要務，不應在實行　法之後，始注意及之。在此時期，凡省之措施與憲法規定省自治體之原則背道而馳者，必須立即停辦。凡足以奠定憲法實行後省　之基礎者，則應早為調整與實施，以為行憲之準備。如劃分中央與省之行政機構系統，以尊重省自治團體之地位；提高省主席之權責，作實行省長制以求行政一元化之準備；裁併機關，簡化機構，以集中力量，統一事權，　節開支，推進政務。放寬審核省預算及工作計劃之尺度，但求與國策與法令不抵觸，不變更其內容及方針，以逐漸培養其自治能力等。</p>
<p>第二實施行政三聯制，提高行政之效率。　省政之改革目的，無非在使省民有權，省政府有能。欲使省政府成為萬能政府，提高行政效率，非實行行政三　制不可。凡行政三聯制之原則，如實行　僚長制，分層負責制，分級負責制，計劃政治，計劃經濟等，均須參照　的，澈底改革，以求實現。</p>
<p>內政部此次呈送行政院審核之省政改革方案，（巳刋登八月八日南京中央日報）為改革地方政治之重要文獻。其內容分劃分系統，確定　　，簡化機構，管理人事，改進政務五項，均極扼要，切中時弊。而各省上主席座談會亦提供寶貴之意見，具見各言之重視。作者服務省政，　十餘年，亦願以平時所見，略陳一二，就正於高明。</p>
<p>（甲）劃分系統。　內政部原　規定中央各院發佈政令，及各部會執行主管事務，應以省政府為對象。各部會除因法定程序（如民政廳長為選舉監督之類）得與省屬各廳處相互行文外，一律不得直接行文。此種規定，原為尊重省政府之事權，實行分級負責制，可以政令一貫，　責集中，使省主席總　省政，各廳處受省主席指揮節制，自不致如過去各　處與中央之主管部會，各有隸屬，各權系統，發生尾大不掉之弊。但各廳處與中央主管部會如果嚴格規定，一律不得直接行文，如教育部不能與省教育廳行文，教育廳不能與縣教育局直接行文，則縣教育科何必改局，省政府又何必設廳設處？如應處在省政府府之地位，相當於各部會之司及各縣政府之科，為省政府內部之　組，而不成其為獨立之機構，此種改革，在社會日趨進步政務日　之今日，是否適當，頗成疑問。故硬性規定一律不得直接行文，似難贊同。實則純粹行政事務，固應一律由行政院命令行之，主管部長副署，或由主管部會對省政府以咨函行之，以一事權，但各部會之主管事務，純屬於方法上技術上之指導者，仍得直接行文，以求便捷。如此實行分級負責制，得於權　集中之外，并收脈絡貫通，運用靈活之效。</p>
<p>（乙）確定權責　依照行政三聯制中分　負責制之原則，以列舉方式，詳為規定，俾各知所守。其內容以省政府主席代表省政府行使職權，各　處長均應受其節制，為將來實行省長制之準備。其列舉各點，與各省依據行政院前頒各機關　　分　負責與辦事細則之原則與方式所訂之省政府分　負責辦事通則，大致相同。果能如法實行，足以各守崗位，各負其責，養成自動自立之　神，　立機關民主化之楷模，奠定　政實施之基礎，此其優點。惟有美中不足者，現距實行憲政之時期雖近，但實行省長民選之時尙有待，在此過渡時期，省主席主持省政沿有相當時期，省主席之人選標準，應該有具體規定。「人有政舉，人亡政息」。省主席得人與否，關係一省之政治興衰實大。兌車民分治，為全國上下一致之呼聲，軍人兼政，頗易形成割據之局面，地方有軍權，應該成過去。經國民革命　十年來之艱苦奮鬥，地方　據之局已趨消滅，　　軍　軍之努力，軍隊尤必須國家化。地方綏靖之責任，應同國家軍隊負其責，實再無軍人兼主席之必要。此點不但國人如此主張，　魏德邁特使此次來　亦有此建議。但　前省主席之　軍人者，實佔百分之九十以上，且其中多為現役軍官，而此次改革方案中，「軍民分治」，雙字未提，似為其最大缺點。</p>
<p>（丙）簡化機構　原案規定：照修正省政府組織法及省政府合署辦公暫行規程所規定之機構，並參酌實際需要情形，將原有之機關，斟酌裁併，所　行政事務，依其性質，歸併於應設之各廳處內，至事　機關，一併改隸接管之應處管理。此項辦法，簡化機構，集中事權，原則甚當。惟細繹全文，有兩點應加補充：（一）為原規定裁併之機關，僅係指省　機關為眼，以余主張，凡中央在省設立之機關，其主管事務與省政府各廳處職權重　者，（例如各種稅收機關之可併於省府財政廳，為彰明較　者），亦應將其機關連同經費　併於各廳處內，此其一。又如何裁併機關，不能授權於省，應由省政府擬具辦法，呈請行政院核定實施。蓋省機關之設置，均有法令之根據，省府未便　其好惡，有所主張，惟有由中央決定後，以行政院令行之。余之具體裁併意見，以為省政府設秘書，會計，保　，社會四處，及民財　建四　，其餘所屬省級行政機關，一律裁併，事業機關，一律改　。軍管區司令部保安司令部　　須與省政府平行；因國防部　隸屬於行政院，則該兩司令部亦自可隸於省政府，併入省保警處。至各省自　設置之機關，一律裁併，更不待言。</p>
<p>（丁）管理人事　依照現行省政府組織法，省政府主席就省政府委員中任命一人兼任，與民財教　等　長之　　，由委員中兼任，并無二致。均由行政院　院會通過後，　國府任命。但實際上委員兼　處長，多　省主席保　，無形中已成為首長制。省政改制，　由省主席總　省政，　向行政院負責，此種用人權，似有理由。但此次改革方案中如此規定：「各　處之任用，由中央制定　　登記辦法，　成各主管部將合格人選預為儲備（會計長由主計處辦理）　有缺出，即由主管部　出二人至三人於行政院會議議決任用，除秘書長外，不　省政府主席去留」，　起各省主席座談會之反對。但作者　同內政部意見，以為將來實行憲政，採省長　，省長由民選，有一定任　，而不設委員，其以下　　機構及事業機構，不論民財建　四　及秘會保社各處長，均應　事務官；事務官不應受政潮影響，不應　　長共進退，故由中央主管部會　選專門人員提行政院院會通過，轉請任命，以保持萬能政府，自　適當。內政部此種主張，并不為過，　表贊同。但省主席以及將來之省長，對於各廳處長，似應保有向中樞參劾之權，以補救指揮不　之　。</p>
<p>（戊）改進政務。　內政部原案計分五點：（一）中央在省之業務應以委託省辦為原則；（二）工作計劃如與國策之法令不抵觸，中央審查以不變更其內容為原則；（三）　化公文程序；（四）規定事業費不得過少；（五）整理　行法規等，均極扼要。如過去對於各省工作謨，中央各部會往往審核過嚴，反足以表示不尊重省之意見，有背省自治之原則，又因此不能及時核定，竟有時至廿六年七月而省卅六年度計劃尙未核準者，因此計劃等於具　。又如署辦公制下之文書處理，特別　慢，據　乃光先生調查，一件公文入省府由收文登記輾轉遞送至承辦人有十八個程序，由承辦人擬稿輾轉送核至主席判行，又有十七個程序（見　著中國行政新論）。文　簡化，萬分應該。</p>
<p>惟作者除此五項改進外，尙有數項補充：</p>
<p>（一）省預算必須早為核定。　各省年度預算，往往以中央認真審核需時有于年度終了，而本年度預算尙未奉核準者，以致不能照預算執行；工作計劃必須根據預算，以預算未決定，計劃亦無從執行。省政乃在無預算無計劃之　幹中，而欲望其上軌道，如何可得？查今後省預算，應分為兩種：一為委辦事項之預算，即執行中央委辦事項之經費，應由委辦之中央機關負　，為國家預算之一部；一為自治事項之預算，即辦理省地方自治事務及監督縣辦理自治事務之經費，應由自治稅捐收入之省　開支。其預算既經其民　機關審議通過，監督機關之中央　　必多事挑剔，只須不抵觸法令及國策即可，應該在年度開　　　為核定。至如何收，如何支，均為自治團體本身之事，　　　涉，故在改革方案中，應明文規定省預算必須在年度開　　　定。</p>
<p>自治團體之財權，必須尊重。目前省財政之困難，　　　端，但中央對省不尊重其財權，實為其主因。在收入方面，必須求得稅權之適當劃分，在支出方面，必須力求節流。　　　中央令省之委　事項，多於自治事項，但委辦事項多未　　　經費，由中央委　　　負担。若委辦事項悉由上級委辦機關　　經費辦理，自治收入均用之於自治事業，尊重自治財　，則各省財政當不致如現在之困難。且取之於民，用之於民，　　取亦不為　，自可自趨於自給自足，解除目前省財政之　　。</p>
<p>（三）中央之委辦事項，應有限制。　中央在省所經營之事業，固　應另設機構，以委託省政府代辦為原則，但亦不能事事委託，漫無限制。純粹國家事務不宜委託省辦者，不得委託　　，　省得致力於省自治事業之舉辦及縣自治之監督，庶不致疲於　命。至何者得委辦，何者應自辦，應以憲法一〇七條至第一一〇條之規定為凖。</p>
<p>以上意見，如荷當局採納，於審核內政部省政改革方案草案時，予以補充修正，敢信其當有若干　益。</p>

<h3>自由黨拒不合作希外長組閣失敗　美對希政潮取旁觀態度</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿四日廣播：希臘外長蔡爾達理斯今日組新閣之勢力，已穴吿失敗，蓋自由黨領袖蘇福里斯已拒絕入關也。希外長今日曾與蘇氏會談一小時之久，但無結果。</p>
<p>〔路透社雅典廿四日電〕希臘國王保羅已於昨夜授命人民黨領袖蔡爾達理斯組織新內閣，蔡氏可望於星期一提出新閣名單，議會亦已定於星期四開會，聆取新閣之施政方針。蔡氏昨接受欽命出宮後，表示將請各黨包括自由黨參加新內閣，蔡爾達理斯並將於星期四要求國會對其新閣投信任票。（國爲蔡爾達理斯）</p>
<p>〔路透社雅典廿三日電〕希臘內閣因內政問題分裂爲二，而於今日辭職後，希王保羅今日召集政黨領袖會晤，以期解決危機。內閣昨所對論之內政措施中，包括宣布共黨爲非法之建議，結果未曾成立一項決議。今日副總理自由黨之維尼瑞洛斯。內長社會民主黨之巴本特魯及航空部長國家聯明黨之卡尼洛波洛斯。即首先宣吿辭職，內閣亦隨之垮台。希臘內閣現似已裂成兩派，一係由外長蔡爾達理斯所領導，另一派即係首先辭職之三中心黨派閣員，巴本特魯有染指陸軍部長之意。此間美國方面人士深恐右翼人民黨秉政後，將採取急進強力政策，使國家薄弱之資源再受緊張的榨取。若干觀察家預料解決危機之可能途徑有三：（一）由祭爾達理斯及其人民黨組成右翼政府；（二）由人民黨及自由黨合組「救國內閣」；（三）組成個性的政府，以全國最有聲望之人物，若達瑪斯基諾斯大主敎或普拉斯蒂爾將軍等任領導。人民黨領導之政府勢將對游擊隊採取極端高壓政策，自由人民兩黨之聯合政府則可望採取中間政策，會同議會份子以和平方法解決國內局勢。然自由黨領袖八十八高齡之蘇福里斯與蔡爾達理斯之問，意見素被視爲不能妥協，至於組織過渡性的個性政府，以頒佈大赦凖備新選舉，恐亦難望獲得國會之支持。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿三日電〕國務院官員非正式表示，希臘政府之垮台，乃爲組織更普遍的內閣之機會，美國對於新政府之改組，不擬直接干涉。</p>
<h3>美譴責蘇附庸國支持希臘游擊戰</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿四日電〕美國頃指斥蘇聯三衛星國，阿爾巴尼亞。保加利亞。及南斯拉夫有侵略希臘之行爲，並指控蘇聯阻礙安理會防止侵略之努力。美國重行要求採取「國際行動，以維持巴爾幹之和平」。美國特別斥責在最近希邊境越界行動再起聲中，阿保南三國積極支持在希臘境內之游擊戰，並稱，三國「悍然公開拒絕」與聯合國調査團合作。美國務院並發表兩份報吿，　述聯合國戰地小組五月二十日在希北調査之情形，以支持其指斥。報吿申稱，小組之工作因三國之阻撓性戰術，大受妨害。提及蘇聯時，國務院稱，「安理會因蘇聯在七月廿九日八月十九日兩次使用否決權，致對阿保南侵略希臘一事，不能加以有效之劍止。代理國務卿羅維特解釋稱，美將該案提交下屆聯大，旨在避免蘇聯在安理會中運用其否決權」。</p>
<h3>希保兩國邊界發生槍擊事件</h3>
<p>〔路透社索菲亞廿四日電〕保加利亞政府之公報稱：希保邊界發生兩次事件，希平民曾向保兵二名開槍，而希軍隊則向保國飛機一架射擊。保政府已將此事報吿盟管會，並請共向希政府嚴重抗議，制止希方之挑釁。保政府同時並已通知聯合國安理會。</p>
<h3>荷請英總領　擬印尼現狀報告</h3>
<p>〔路透社偷敦廿四日電〕英外交部一官員稱：荷蘭業於今日　英國准許英國駐吧城之總領事，就印尼與荷軍問之停戰令生效以來，印尼最近之發展，擬具個人報吿，可能時向聯合國安理會提出。該官員拒絕稅明英方之答覆如何，但消息靈通方面對於英國之是否能於最近的將來術共所請，尙表懷疑，蓋英駐吧城總領米契遜即將卸職，而新任總領薛浦赫須至九月初始能接任。同時英政府對於印尼普遍戰爭再度爆發之可能性，芷予以密切之注意。</p>
<h3>阿根延總統警告反對黨　將以行動迫其就</h3>
<p>〔合衆社阿根廷京城廿四日電〕阿根廷總統貝隆　在歡迎貝隆夫人返國之大會中，警吿反對派稱，其忍耐力已告消失，如反對派不肯接受其保持平靜之要求，渠將強彼等服從此項要求。貝隆夫人訪歐歷時兩月有半，返抵此間時，鞦迎會之奢華盛大，爲阿　所僅見。員隆聲稱，「吾人要求世界整個之和平。安　及合作，惟惡勢力蓄意陰謀破壞及中傷，致使吾人之耐性及平靜均告喪失」。貝　提及反對黨時，十萬羣衆高呼「絞死他們」，致演說中斷數分鐘。</p>
<h3>英保證本年底　移轉緬政權</h3>
<p>制憲會考慮修正國　法</p>
<p>〔路透社仰光廿三日電〕緬甸總理泰金諾今日告記者稱，英政府業已保證於今年十二月底或至　明年一月，可以移轉緬甸之政權，緬內閣現巳在考慮與英所訂條約之原則。　金諾述及國內一般局勢時，譴責反政府份子之破壞戰略，並稱：政府寗顧倚賴民衆力量，而不假借外力以重建秩序。</p>
<p>〔路透社仰光廿三日電〕可靠方面息：緬甸制憲議會可能制定緬甸國民之新定義，使希望居於緬甸之大批華人，印度人，及其他非緬甸人，得以成爲緬人。制憲議會循各華人及印度團體之請，不久即將修正國籍法之規定。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿四日廣播：自一九四四年起任職迄今之厄瓜多總統伊巴拉，已於本日被推悉，而由國防部長孟哲諾執掌大權。伊氏已被逮捕，押往某術戍地，預料渠不久將離開基多，前往哥侖此亞。</p>
<h3>蘇聯允就朝鮮問題談判　草擬工作報告書　莫洛托夫已函覆馬歇爾</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿三日電〕莫斯科電台今日宣佈：蘇聯外長莫洛托夫已函復美國務卿馬歇爾，謂朝鮮問題美蘇混合委員會蘇方代表願意合作，草擬工作報吿書，以便雙方政府立即討論各項步驟，完成莫斯科協定之目標。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿四日電〕莫斯科電台廣播莫洛托夫對馬卿覆兩，內稱，蘇聯之所默契者，祗有擁護莫斯科協定中關於朝鮮部分之各政黨及社團，始能與之協商。莫洛托夫說及美蘇在莫斯科會議中決定，將朝鮮暫時劃分爲兩佔領區，經過一個時期之托管，然後再設立自由朝鮮政府。莫洛托夫稱，蘇政府認爲各政府社團之屬於反對莫斯科決議者，不能與之會議，祗有渠等脫離上述委員會始屬可能。否則此項政黨即不能參加會商。又稱，蘇政府相信會商應與超過一萬黨員之政黨會商，惟最近朝鮮南部擁護莫斯科協定之政黨與社團，却受到美黨局之嚴峻之限制與迫害，此事實違反民主原則與莫斯科會議之決定。</p>

<h3>修正借款協定第九條英美成立非正式協議　財政會議至此告一段落</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿三日電〕英財政代表團國長伊第爵士，已與美方官員就修正英美借款協定第九條禁止岐視之款，成立非正式協議，此爲此次會談中　就借款協定第八條承兌英鎊之款成立止兌之協議後，所獲之第二項重大結果。</p>
<p>英美財政會議至此已吿一段落，而伊第爵士及英格蘭銀行副總裁戈波爾亦定明日離美返倫敦，向政府報吿此會之進展，並討論本於此項協議應採之政策。英美借款協定第九條規定限制英國自　幣區購買貸物，以防歧視自美元區之輸入，雙方於此所成立之協議，殆係非正式者，尙待從事技術性之討論，俾得毋需經由美國國會而正式修正借款協定該條之規定。其後果可使英國再事减少自美國購物，轉向英帝國及　幣區購買類似之物。伊第爵士返倫敦後，即將晤內閣要員，以擬具英國國際收支平衡之計劃，準備由兩國高級要員恢復討論。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿三日電〕。英國政府或將於兩個月內要朮美國繼續修正卅七億五千美元之貸款協定，美國官方坦白承認若輩絕不能担保美方所已給予之讓步，可使英國穏渡美元危機。美國財政專家曾默許將來必要時繼續與英專家進行會議。</p>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿三日電〕英美法國代表今日在此第二次秘密會議，討論提高德國工業生產問題。據英方人士稱，法國可望同意美英計劃。當時美代表陶格拉斯與英代表任金斯謀緩和法國對德國工業生產增加足以威脅法國之恐懼。漢代表馬西格里則表示法　　　　贊成高德　　　鐵生蒙，但不擬無條件贊成每年出產一子一百萬噸之議。</p>
<h3>法捷同盟條約　數月內可望簽訂</h3>
<p>〔路透社普拉格廿三日電〕急願成立緊密防衛制度以抗德國未來侵略之捷克斯拉夫，希望不久能與法國或立同盟條約。捷外交部官員預料捷法同盟條約，在數月以內即可簽訂。捷克現已與蘇聯，波蘭·南斯拉夫訂有同盟條約。捷克若干右翼人士，且有贊成與英國締盟者，然官方則聲明迄至目前爲止，尙無此等談判進行。</p>

<h3>義傾向西歐集團　蘇否決議加入聯合國顯非友好　共黨勢力業已一蹶不振</h3>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬廿三日電〕自蘇聯否決義大利參加聯合國，義政府又能在內政方面及時實施一平穩經濟政策，致政府威信日增，而義大利共黨之勢力則一蹶不振後，政治觀察家相信一般超然派及自由派人士均認蘇聯此舉，「顯然無友好可言」，加以義總理加斯貝利向美貸款要求再加三百五十萬元，此二因素，使號稱無所偏倚之義大利，傾向西歐集團。</p>
<h3>聯合國要不要蘇聯？</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>近來人們常常談到這個問題：假如五強之一的蘇聯不請從旁阻撓，聯合國是否會得成功，這種局面也許會不斷演變下去，究竟有沒有補救辦法？這個問題漸漸顯得迫切起來而引起　人的注意。本文的目的，即對此問題作一個簡單的分析。</p>
<p>兩條路可走</p>
<p>常總得對於聯合國最感失望的人們說：我們沒有法子和蘇聯合作，也沒有法子把它　出去。他們引證蘇聯過去的事跡，和它的劃一不二的否決權。不過，假如蘇聯阻撓聯合國的一切努力，其他的會員國要繼續爭取聯合國的兩個目標——安全和進步，只有兩條路錢可走：</p>
<p>第一，非蘇聯系的會員國可以全力發揮蘇聯所不能干涉的聯合國的能力。其次，假如這條路走不通，它們可以集體退出聯合國，另行設立同樣的機構而不讓蘇聯加人。</p>
<p>第一條路綫要巧妙運用第一條路綫——即不顧蘇聯的反抗，就現在的聯合國機構發揮其功能——必須明瞭該機構的目標，力量及其限度。大家都知通聯合國的目標是世界和平，安全及進步，可是很少人知道它的力量和限度。熟悉聯合國憲軍的人們承認聯合國只有得到列強的會作，纔能維持和平與安全。聯合團不是一個本身具有威力能促成和平的機構，它旣不能壓制具有否決權的五強，即使沒有否決權，也不能壓倒美國或蘇聯。</p>
<p>因此蘇聯從旁阻撓的策略，實在並沒有奪去聯合國維護和平的能力，因爲這能力始終沒有存在　。蘇聯的反抗，僅僅阻礙了足以促成世界和平的國際合作。</p>
<p>在理論上，蘇聯阻　聯合國的能力，僅限於在有否決權的安理會中，對於重大問題的處理。至於在聯合國大會，國際法庭，託管委員會，經濟社會理事會，或附屬機關中，蘇聯是沒有否決權的。在實際上，蘇聯雖可延宕或牽制上述各機關的討論程序，然而畢竟不能阻止多數會員國決定最後步驟。</p>
<p>因此，從表面上看起來，在許多塲合，多數會員國如果採取堅定立塲限制並加速討論的進程，未始不能戰勝蘇聯的延宕政策。在這種塲合，無論棄機或否決權都不生效力，聯合國如果有決心，可以不顧蘇聯而行使其職務。</p>
<p>但是不顧蘇聯的反對，在具有否決權的安理會的執行行動的範圍內，究竟能夠有何作爲呢？</p>
<p>聯合國憲章規定「區域辦法」，以應付適宜於區域行動的安全問題，並且承認會員國如遭遇武力攻擊，在安理會採取行動以前，有單獨或集體的自衛權。關於「區域」和「辦法」兩個詞兒，除了必須符合聯合國原則的規定外，並沒有什麽限制，也無須得到安理會核准。</p>
<p>但「區域」執行行動，除在遵　「武力攻擊」的塲合外，必須得到安理會的核准。遇到這種情形時，在安理會採取維持和平的必要步驟以前，可以採取「區域」防衛措置。</p>
<p>因此在蘇聯繼續表示不合作的狀態之下，似可由蘇聯集團以外的會員國組織一個「區域機關」，以達到聯合國所能獲得的安全措置，必要時可使用否決權以阻止理會的干涉。</p>
<p>假如有非蘇聯系的國家加入，假如它們保證所有的資源都用於集體防衛假如它們同意把有計劃的侵略的實證視作「武力攻擊」，那麽此種「區域」辦法，便可以得到最大的效力，</p>
<p>第二條路綫</p>
<p>假如蘇聯繼續不斷地阻撓聯合國的工作或發展，那麽可以採取第二條路綫，即是：非蘇聯系的國家一齊退出聯合國，另行建立一個新組織，除非蘇聯系國家願意合作，即不准其加入。</p>
<p>優點和缺點</p>
<p>假定新組織和採取區域辦法時一樣，擁有同樣的國家，供給同樣的資源，就安全方面而論，這計劃有幾種優點：第一，它並不限於對付「武力攻擊」的防衛；第二，它無須使用否決權，以便把安理會的重大的任務移交於區域團體；第三，它具有非蘇聯系國家組成的宗旨正直的機構的種種優點，它們的目的在於處理本身的問題，和防備蘇聯集團的侵略。</p>
<p>對於蘇聯祗能延宕而不能阻止聯合國的任務和活動，新組織的行動可以更加迅速有效。新的憲章可以改良舊的。但是在另一方面，有許多活動，橡聯合國大會，經濟曁社會理事會，國際法庭的活動等，其價値全在於它們的普遍性。這一方面的缺點，多少足以抵消效力較大的優點。</p>
<p>考慮須慎重</p>
<p>但是在非蘇聯系國家考慮全體退出聯合國以前，有幾種因素不能不注意及之。聯合國機構是人類欲廢除戰爭，促成一個安全進步世界的抱負最大而範圍最廣一種努力。要是近四十個國家同時退出聯合國，無異承認這種努力已吿失敗，這個責任，它們非到最後一步，是不肯輕易擔當的。（譯自「世界報吿」週刊）</p>

<h3>首輪影院工潮　昨晚協議復工　一天損失六萬萬元　今日可望恢復開映</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全市十五家百輪電影院因電影業職工會第二分會會員罷工，昨日全部停業。二三四輪各電影院未受波及，仍照常開映，惟少數職工有「懶工」現象。社會局昨終日召集勞資雙方調解，至晚七時獲得協議。原定晚九時一刻一場即恢復開映，因臨時不及通知，未能放映，今日上午如無變化，下午各百輪電影院即可全部恢復開映。</p>
<p>據有關方面估計，因此次首輪戲院職工罷工市府娛樂稅收入損失一億元，各影院則損失五億餘元。</p>
<p>吳市長與社會局吳局長於前晚聞悉各百輪電影院職工罷工後，大為震怒，認為因美琪戲院一家糾紛而造成如此嚴重情形，實違背總動員法令，影響社會秩序。除令社會局勞工處依法調解外，並令轉知電影院職工立即復工。</p>
<p>電影院業·四項要求·</p>
<p>電影院商業同業公會於昨晨十時召開緊急會議，籌商對策。席間理事長梁其田申述因渠經營之美琪戲院一家糾紛而致波及其他各院，甚感抱歉。當場提出辭職。下午三時該會繼續開會，決議四項：（一）要求社會局在試行調解以前，職工應無條件復工。（二）根據工會法，工會不能强迫僱主僱用其介紹之工人，此次工潮責任在勞方，各院係被迫停業。故要求保留電影業職工會第二分會非法僱工各院所受之損害賠償請求權。（三）要求當局嚴懲此次煽動工潮之為　者。（四）職工罷工期內工資一律照扣。</p>
<h3>職工靜候調解</h3>
<p>各百輪電影院職工昨日多聚集工會第二分會內靜候社會局調解。工會要求遵照前訂筆錄「添僱職工時應儘先錄用工會登記之優良失業會員」，認為美琪院方應辭退所僱之三非工會會員之女領導。資方則認為失業會員大多因過失而被資方辭退者，美琪所錄用之三女領票員，係由院方董事會介紹，董事會有權顧問戲院本身之人事問題。</p>
<h3>三領票員　暫停服務</h3>
<p>社會局勞工處長沈鼎，調解科長樊振邦，副科長顧若峯及朱圭林等，昨日為調解該項糾紛，竟日到局辦公。總工會水祥雲，方如升，警察總局刑事處黃作新，錢大猷亦會同協助調解。吳市長於上午兩度致電沈處長囑迅謀調決，經沈處長等召集勞資雙方代表調解，至下午四時半職工已允先行復工，資方認為未得保障，拒絕復業。至七時，始議定美琪戲院所僱之三女領票員暫停服務，靜候社會局依法處理。至勞方指資方違約而資方認為未曾違約事，待由社會局根據筆錄及事實召集調解決定。職工即於當晚九時一刻復工惟因放映間職工及院方高級職員事先未及通知，故未及映演。社會局當夜訓令職工會限令各院職工先無條件復工，同時又訓令同業公會轉知美琪戲院所僱之三女領票員暫停服務，聽候調解。沈處長等當夜即將調解經過電告吳市長及吳局長。</p>
<h3>方未表同意</h3>
<p>唯據同業公會昨日深夜表示：影院業為求今後有切實保障，提出四項要求，其中一項為職工無條件復工，今社局通知美琪戲院三領票員暫停服務，仍係「有條件」。三領票員之資歷才幹皆無不合之處，且並未違法，當局實無理由令院方通知其暫停服務云云。</p>
<h3>爭道發現挖眼黨　謠言惑衆　蘇州河中釀成命案　舟子被毆死傷兩人　行兇船戶十七人被捕偵查</h3>

<p>祗聞人言　並未目睹</p>
<p>直至該管水上警分局，聞訊趕到，詢明原委，將周及船夥救出，時周以昏迷，急送公濟醫院救治，而小傻子已被毆斃。當時遂將行兇之陳瑞亭，劉瑞狗，徐才有，鄔有人，曹善之，陳長桂，馬學成，姚寶興，朱廷宰，施祥郎，沙關臣，莆祺麟，楊其郎，朱用林，鄧富根，衛富金，李德發等十七人拘獲，帶入分局偵查。據各被告供稱：對「挖眼黨」之出現，祗聞人言，均未目睹，當時因聞有人喊打，趁一時血氣，參加毆打，因而釀成命案是實。水上警分局刻正繼續嚴密查究中。</p>

<h3>兩路局長陳伯莊播講　「京滬區鐵路客運概况」　客運最高紀錄每日三百萬人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報昨日假座亞美麟記者電台，舉辦第二十一次星期日特別廣播，請京滬滬杭兩路局局長陳伯莊播講「京滬區鐵路客運鈣况」茲記錄其演詞大意如下：</p>
<p>現在的京滬區鐵路管理局所管轄的鐵路，就是戰前的京滬和滬杭，普通所稱兩路便是。我想現在社會對兩路最關心的就是它的客運。一直到現在我們還沒有能解決客運的擁擠，這是我們十分抱歉的。京滬區鐵路的接收是從前年十月一日開始，到了現在已經二十二個月，快到兩年的光景。在這兩年之內，兩路的交通從沒有間斷過，雖然行車事變在所不免，臨時發生路綫阻塞，但這是任何鐵路都有的情形。</p>
<p>要再補充八十輛</p>
<p>接收的時候，我們祗有客車一九〇輛，現在我們增加到四八三輛。以座位而論，接收時京滬綫有一萬座，現在已經增加到三萬二千座。滬杭綫接收時四千座位，現在已經增加到一萬三千座位。兩綫合計的座位，一共是四萬五千座，但是照我們客運的情形，一共約需要五萬座位，才能解除客運擁擠，這個差額五千座位，是我們積極要解決的最重要的問題。兩年來我們增加客車的方法，全靠把貨車改造變為客車，同時在美國我們定購了若干車輛，這些美國車輛祗是舊車，為了大戰之後，各國都需要補充他們自己鐵路的車輛，因此在兩年之內，便沒有新車可以出口，現在我祗要再補充八十輛，就能解除客運的擁擠。各位也許不知道本路，現在客運數量比戰前大大的增加了。在戰前兩路平均每日客運人數不過一百四十萬人，但從復員以來，客運最高記錄，到過三百餘萬人，而平均總在二百三四十萬左右。我們所負担的運輸任務，的確比戰前大得多了！</p>
<p>敷設雙軌困難多</p>
<p>社會上一般的觀感，總以為京滬路應敷設雙軌，不錯的，連接首都與工商業中心的上海的京滬路，在最近的將來，確有敷設雙軌的資格。但就日前的需要而論，我們不必作這樣的奢求。假如無錫上海間能够敷設雙軌，京滬路運輸困難就完全解決了。因為現在行車密度最高的就在上海無錫間，每廿四小時達四十次，雖然還沒有達到單綫行車的飽和點，但在調度上，行車準點上，已經發生了不少的困難。可是就現在的財力，我們還不敢存這樣的奢望。除此之外，我們在另一方面，希望裝置CTC電氣集中控制行車制，這是增加單綫行車能力最經濟最有效的辦法，使得兩站之間同向列車跟隨行駛，從一列增至二三列。</p>
<p>飛快車需費龐大</p>
<p>各位一定記得戰前的飛快車，京滬之間五小時內，可以到達，誠然這是社會上一種迫切的需要。但是要行駛飛快車，我們非將四十七萬根的枕木，和全部鋼軌換去不可。可是枕木和鋼軌都要來自外洋，需要外滙，而且所需款項實在很大，這就要看政府的決定和友帮的援助，能否使此實現。專就路局本身財力而論，這樣鉅大的投資是辦不到的。</p>
<h3>特別廣播節目</h3>

<p>稚老對魏德邁氏奉美總統之命來華，國人均盼美國援華，能因魏氏此來而加强，認爲此種期望與事勢，尙不相悖，蓋中國現在之戡亂，美國人有認爲係內亂者，甚至國人亦頗多誤認爲內戰，實際此戰，絕非蔣介石與毛澤東爭奪家私，政府對共黨歷來容忍，各地戰事，無役非共黨先啓　，倘再忍讓下去，即不啻拿中國整個讓毛澤東來統治故此戰實爲政制之戰，絕非私人或黨派爭奪統治之爭。如國人歡迎共黨統治，則此戰不特是內戰」且完全爲多餘，至美國在思想及政制上完全與蘇聯不同，中國如受共黨統治，於美大有不利，現美人不願中國成爲共黨統治之天下，而一面又認中國戡亂亂戰爲內戰，實爲極大之矛盾，至　議中國政治腐敗，貪汚之風，遍於全國，又不予美國旅華僑商以貿易上之便利，以此為反對援華之理由與國內若干人民，一面希望太平，一面單知痛心疾首於政治腐敗，亦無二致，蓋政治腐敗及貪汚之風熾盛，胥由戰事而起，戰亂未戢，政府不得不以全力應付戰事，自無暇顧及門戶之整潔徒　訾議，此在國人同大爲不當，在美人亦爲淺識，美當局權衡利害，其見解當有異於此。總之中國縱爲貓脚爪，代美人火中取栗，爪上亦須稍稍加油潤淨，俾免探爪火中，栗未得而先焦，此理甚明，故美國今後援華之加强，縱不免有波折，殆為事勢所必至。</p>
<p>稚老繼復論及戡亂之趨勢及戰禍戢止，重現太平之期限，謂：有人以爲國軍力量漸次减弱，此點絕非事實，至共軍似有較强之趨勢，亦至多僅在蘇聯方面，得若干鮮日部隊而已。惟美人當知所營惕且蘇聯正集中一切力量，在十年內（至少五年內）不願輕耗力量，故三次大戰，在五年至十年內，決不致爆發，共黨亦決不可能得大量之外援。戡亂完成之期，如平平穩穩，無意外枝節，即有告終之可能也。但戰爭最易引起意外變化，尤其有國際間複雜之關係，引起變化之可能更多，故天下太平，則須待戰亂戢</p>
<h3>青市花界　捐二千萬勞軍救災</h3>
<p>〔本報靑島廿四日電〕靑市花界二〇二戶以書寓聯誼會名義，今晨捐款二千百六十二萬元，勞軍並救濟難民及流亡學生。止，經過多年整理之後。</p>
<p>稚老對美國「生活」「幸福」「時代」等雜誌發行人魯斯，曾撰文謂。中國目前有（一）文盲太多，（二）貪汚，（三）腐敗，（四）凡事虛僞，只知粉飾門面等四大病，均不足慮，英國當依利薩伯時代，法國路易十四時代，四病亦充斥，迨後工業勃興，社會經濟改觀，此四病即一掃而空，並世各國中，貧窮而能淸潔，不見四病猖獗者，僅有日本，捨此以外，均屬一邱之貉。目前中國處於美蘇兩大之間的夾板中生活，自然難過，掃除貧窮，更談不到，但夾板裏生活，實尙勝於受獨强之統治。美現在總算是吾人之友，但如有朝一日麥克阿瑟移駐北平，則美人之斯的克，必時常光顧吾人之頭上，否人亦惟有在夾板中生活下去，儘可能力謀改善，努力生產，此爲吾人所能爲而又應爲者也。</p>
<p>稚老對此次選舉，不承認參加競選，對兵役問題，謂征兵制並非外國貨，試觀田賦中之地丁，可知從前早已征丁，惟募兵亦非不佳。魯豫等省人民，樂於當兵，而江蘇人則不慣，但現在戡亂時期，征兵已見於實行。</p>
<p>最後，稚老縱論世界上有四件事，一爲道德，即眾人所共由之路，因各人地位不同，對道德之見解，亦有差異，次爲經濟，又次爲政治，以此節制於道德經濟兩者之間，、最後則爲慾望。常爲人類作祟，而受前三者之壓制，環境窮困，則慾望不能達，而道德政治均失其力量，故改善經濟環境，實最重要，而改善之手段，決唯科學，孟子曾謂「昏夜乞水火於鄰，使萬物如水火，則世無有不仁考矣。」水火為自然所產生，最不値錢，使能藉科學之力，而做到萬物皆如水火之不値錢，則天下自然太平，道德固無所謂，政治亦不需要矣，故藉科學之力以改進環境，更不容或緩也。</p>

<h3>婺源農貸　茶會下月辦竣</h3>
<p>〔本報婺源廿一日訊〕近年洋莊茶葉衰落，農村經濟，多恃木·紙·桐油三項收益為大宗。中農對婺源農業貸款，係包括茶。木·桐油·紙張四項，為放款對象。</p>
<p>本年該行駐婺農貸處，首先核發茶貸，計本年全縣毛茶總額爲八千担，貸款茶商共三十四家，貸額最多者一千祖，佔全數八分之一。一期加工貸額，爲十三億六千萬，二期運輸貸額，每担四十二萬，內除扣回加工貸款十七萬，實發二十五萬，以毛茶總額八千担核發，共爲二十億元。此項貸款，連日已陸續發放。</p>
<p>至木材·紙張·桐油貸款，每商戶尙未進行登記，該行以政市獎勵桐油出口，本邑桐油貸款，亟應舉辦。木材·紙張關係省際貿易，資助發展，不容忽視。一俟茶貸結束，即行續辦太紙。油貸，茶貸結束期，本年九月間可辦完竣，此時桐油將出新，木·紙兩項，爲冬令旺銷季節，乘時舉辦農貸，行戶雙方，均能交受其益云。（寗）</p>
<h3>閩僑經建公司　接辦榕公共汽車投資後即起糾紛</h3>
<p>〔本報福州二十日訊〕籌備年餘之閩僑經建公司於今年七月十二日在厦門建立，到南洋各埠僑領數十人，極一時之盛。公司今後業務方針，據悉以開發閩省工鑛及疏暢省內及省際交通爲中心。而公司成立伊始，投資之第一對象，即爲福州公共汽車公司。</p>
<p>福州市內及郊外公共汽車原由復興福峽兩汽車公司組織之聯營處主辦，惟該處因資金短絀，不特無力添購新車，即輪船與材料之補充亦感困難，且股東間糾紛時起，影響業務至鉅，該處乃呈請建廳，准派員　請閩僑經建公司合作投資，後於經建公司在廈成立期間，建廳及聯營處均有代表到厦向經建公司作數度之接洽，經公司方面表示同意『當派公司副董事長王振相及高級人員黄重涵兩人於旬前來榕談判投資合作問題，雙方協議結果：經建投資四億元，連同原聯營處之福峽復興兩公司，叧加福興泉汽車公司資產折價投資約五億元，此九億元價爲新公司之全部股金，成立「經建福州公共汽車公司」，推閩省參議長丁超五任董事長，經建代表黄重涵任總經理。不意此項改組，引起一部分股東及員工之不滿，如股東林得求等延請律師陳霖英登報抗議，表示此項改組未開股東大會取得全體股東大會之同意，殊屬少數人壟斷侵犯多數股東之合法權益，將依法起訴；員工方面以員工福利問題宋獲解決，不應遽爾改組，亦請律師陳登瀛，侯光第登報聲明，請經建公司暫　接辦。叧而，股東方面對於新公司所選出之董監事人選至表不滿，員工方面又風聞新公司人事行將澈底改組，皆感忐忑不安，日前市內各路公共汽車車廂周圍，發現有「提高工人政治地位」及「打倒……」等等標語，極引起當局及社會各界之重視。此事如未獲適當調解，事態可能擴大。據經建公司副董事事長王振相對記者表示：該公司接辦榕市公共汽車，原爲應邀而來，初無壟斷把持之意，惟此事足以說明僑胞回國投資之不易。</p>

<h3>杭州民營紗廠　面臨新危機</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州廿日訊〕離開杭州市區八公里路的拱宸橋，那裏有一座在浙江要算最大工廠之一的杭州第一紗廠，它建築的面積達一百畝以上，它擁有二萬錠的機子，它有一千五百多的職工。記者獲着一個機會，去參觀了該廠全部的經營機構，同時又了解了當前民營工業的新危機。</p>
<p>我承該廠襄理潘鴻鼎先生的領導，參觀了淸花機，組紗機，細紗機，微布機，準備間，機器間，印染間，包紮房等。在這許多的機器中，一半差不多是一八九七年英美製造的，另一半是一九二九年的。因爲這個廠原先是在淸朝時就成立的，後來爲三友實　社所有，再後來，才又售給現在該廠的總經理張文魁先生等的。所以機器的年代都比較久遠了。他們紡紗最高爲二十二支，最低爲十支十二支，每天約可出貨二十件，每件有四十小包，每小包有十磅重量。他們織的毛巾每天可出五六百打，床毯每天可出五百條，細布可出三百疋。不過就我們參觀所得，織布織而中的機子空着的也不少，據說開足有六百台，現在僅開二三百台，原因紗少，不能大量生產，現在所紡的紗多半是行總交美棉，再將棉花紡成了紗交給行總，再以市價轉售給其他布廠的。據說美棉可紡二十支以上的紗，國棉如需　寳·通州·沙市等處的花僅能紡二十支以下，餘姚的花纖維更短，僅能紡到十二支左右，但餘姚的棉商信用不頂好，往往付定洋後遲緩交貨。一般小城鎮普通都歡迎十二支紗，因爲十二支紗可織襪，雙可織粗布。農村老百姓非常歡迎的。最近這樣的</p>
<p>民營工廠賠本的情形很嚴重，例如二十支紗每件成本在一千〇十一萬餘元，而官價規定僅能賣九百二三十萬元一件。細布每疋成本四十餘萬元，而賣價僅三十七萬元左右，成本高的原因，第一因為機器舊，效能不够高，第二因爲工人的工作效率低，再次因爲原料貴。紗布價格最近賣不高的原因是因爲對日開放貿易了。日本的紗布會　進來。最近日本布已到了上海，僅需價二十萬餘元一疋。另外還有一個原因，是中紡公司用外匯向國外訂購大批美棉，紡紗後再按價售出，而民營公司無法</p>
<p>套得大批外匯訂購美棉，因此中紡甚至行總的紗子價格較低，而民營紗廠便無法歸還其成本。</p>
<p>像杭州第一紗廠，可稱爲浙江唯一的大規模的紗廠了，因爲其他的紗廠，很少有超出一萬錠的。而現在這個紗廠的感覺如此，實在值得我們注意的。我們在治本的立塲講，應該豐裕自己的原料，像餘姚這樣的大棉塲，應該趕快改良種植，如果政府一時不能把所有的棉塲都改良，可以獎勵人民來做。原料姚供給，則可節省很多資金，成本也就减少次應該</p>
<p>積極訓練工人使工人提高硏究的興趣。在廠裏可設獎金，採用泰勒氏的科學管理方法，使工人對工作的進步有濃厚的興趣，這也可以減少成本的。</p>
<p>治標的辦法我們要限制日本花紗布疋的輸入，必要時甚至禁止輸入。因爲中國這一點點脆弱的工業，而脆弱的工業中又佔重要地位的紗布紡織廠，如果被日本花紗布疋大量傾銷，則中國的紗布廠又將墜入危亡的邊緣。其次：中紡公司和行總應該扶植民營紗廠，使民營紗廠能够。</p>
<p>取得抬頭機會因爲紗廠等到底是輕工業，中山先生在民生主義上規定輕工業可由人民經營的，而且要獎勵民營的。現在，不管三七二十一，自己有外匯可以購美棉，自己計算成本足够就賣出去，而不顧及民營工廠的血本，這是不對的。政府設中紡公司揚言扶植民營紗廠，現在民營紗廠眞已到了待扶植的時候了。我們參觀該廠，沉得他們管理當局這種爲事業奮鬥的精神，深感無限的欣佩。（特派員儲裕生）</p>

<p>收兌美鈔價格問題　平衡會在研究中　四聯貸款方針不久即可決定　　〔本報訊〕中央銀行總裁張嘉微，爲改訂結匯辦法實施後，滬市金融物價砍况，及中港經濟協定，輸出入管委會人選諸事，會於上週三晋京向中權最高當局有所報吿。留京期間，並曾與魏德邁特使會晤，提供國行所負責準備之參考資料。茲已公畢，於昨晨返抵本市。據談：收兌美鈔價格問題，刻由外匯平衡基金委會硏究，並待行政院政務會議通過後實行。至於四聯總處對國家行局之貸款方針，亦正由財次兼四聯總處秘書長徐柏園，與各關係方面審做硏討中，即可有所決定云。外匯新政策實行以來　各方情形均良好　徐財次希望工商界相互努力　　〔本報南京廿二日電〕財次徐柏　廿二日語本報記者，外匯新政策實行五日以來情形良好，此一辦法係根據社會要求而擬定，故工商界大多擁護，即國外反應亦甚良好，政府方面現正後各方面努力，以求與整個計劃作全機之配合。此辦法實行後，經濟可望活躍，其爲我經濟走上自力更生之路開一大門，惟能否邁步前進，則仍有待工商界及人民之共體時艱，顧及國家社會經濟條件，多方努力。　　徐氏並鄭重以下列三事希望於全國工商界及人民：對於出口商，徐認為新辦法對出口商有利，盼功再蹈昔日覆轍，競購競買，致發生不利出口現象，同時希望對出口品之品類及標準，能維持應有水準。　　工礦廠商方面，外匯變更後，原料如須由外國運入，成本當增加，惟出產品一部可出口，足資　　，此外高工資及經理費過高，皆足妨碍生產，二者若不能减低，則即使原料價格極低，生產亦無法開展，盼能設法减低。　　最後亦為最重要者，此即社會節約風氣應予養成，政府已擬有節約辦法，盼全國能一體遵行。不然對國內言，再生產之成本即無法積貯。對貿易言，亦易引起走私現象，走私如不防止，外匯因而消耗，貿易亦受其影響，政府方面對走私現象極爲注意。並曾與香港政府商定合作辦法。改　匯率後，走私現象本可减少，然國人若不能節約，則走私現象殊難根絕。故根絕走私應自節約做起。　　記者詢以政府以後貸款政策如何、徐答二政府對此事將審愼處理，匯率改訂後若干出口商以出口有望，搶購可以出口物資，結果必致將出口品價格抬高，政府對此種放款，自當鄭重。再就工礦廠商貸款而言，若干工礦家，於外匯改訂後，咸願多儲原料，此事不一定與平衡發展之旨相合，亦不一定能與整個計劃配合，故當局對此類貸款亦殊審慎。　　記者最後又詢外匯收支情形如何，是否可能發生黑市。徐答：一般而論，可能收入之外匯，較普通估計者當高，僑匯同僑胞已有若干時期積備，未回匯此時外匯匯率提高，可能將以前未匯回者整批匯回，其敷當頗可觀。若干人担心米棉等官價結匯，將影響外匯凖備，徐認此事並不盡然，蓋此類日用品，國內本有生產，向外採購僅係補國內不足，決不致以寳貴外匯無量採購，故不政有何影響。致可能發生之外匯黑市現象，政府當嚴格防止，希望其不致出現。　　楊格任國行顧問　　金融專家，前中國政府財政顧問楊格博士，於八月廿二日由美蒞滬。楊氏離華返美已近一年，此次訪華，係應中央銀行張總裁之邀請，爲該行顧問，協助處理關於平準基金，以及其他當前各項問題。春茂錢莊開董監會陳勸士當選董事長　　本市中正東路春茂錢莊前董事長劉希文因病辭職。該莊董監會特於本月二十日下午四時舉行　監聯席會議議決，准予辭職，公推董事陳　士先生為董事長。按陳氏爲中央常委果夫立夫先生之封翁，在金融界聲譽甚隆。今後該莊領導得人，對於社會金融必多貢獻云。我新外匯政策　有助地毯輸美　　〔中央社紐約廿四日電〕據商務日報載稱：美國中國地毯進口商，對中國政府新外匯政策之一般反響，認爲在中國之基本經濟情形改前後，新政策不致刺激中國地毯輸入美國，恢復中國地毯輸入美國之最重要因素，在中國國內經濟本身之能否改善，而不在公開外匯市塲，原料供　價格之　以估定，及中國工費之不　定，使平津一帶中美地毯製造商，視出產爲過份之冒險。此外美對中國地毯之需求下降亦爲不能刺激中國地毯輸入美國之原因之一，惟自遠大目光觀之，新外匯政策對中國地毯出口商確有神釜，無論如何，美國進口商監於上述不穩定之因素，認爲開放中美貿易之情勢，殊難捉摸。挽救目前茶業困難　茶商代表晉京請願　　〔中央社本市訊〕茶業輸出業同業公會曾於上週四（廿一日）召開全體理監事曾議，決定推派　景　唐季珊孫曉村汪振廣等十四代表定期赴京，陳述茶葉當前困難情形及外匯管理新辦法實施後，應採取之補救方法，對於去年收購之陳茶，要求津貼，以及三十六年度請求收購新茶事，均將由各代表親携呈文，逕向四聯總處陳述一切。茲悉其十四代表除一部份已於廿四晚搭車赴京外，餘則定廿五晨乘機飛京。茲摘錄該公會致四聯總處呈文要點如次：（甲）已奉核定收購之卅五年度箱茶，仍請執行收購，惟對於茶業所請貴高各茶中心價格百分之五十，以示體恤而昭平允一案，擬請鈞處再予考慮，並俯賜照准。（乙）萬一上項辦法須請示層峯，方可決定，不免遷延時日，而茶商倒懸之苦又亟待解救，再四籌維，擬請鈞處准將政府所購外銷箱茶，交由本公會組織推銷委員會負責，將全部茶葉審察國際需要，兼顧卅六年度生產成本，期使市價穩定，僅速外銷。所得價款，除去成本及一切間支外，其純利擬請以半數解　國庫，以半數貼補茶商，藉維國計，而資彌補。（丙）若乙項辦法實施上仍有困難，而按諸卅六年度實際生產成本，高出三十五年箱茶收購價格，竟達三倍以上。如中信局或其他中外出口商以低價相箱茶，向外推銷，則茶商所有之高成本箱茶，勢將處於絕境。故爲通盤籌劃雙方兼顧起見，擬請政府將卅五年度箱茶與三十六年度箱茶，一體辦理。如三十六年度箱茶亦由中信局負責收購，則此項困難，即可根本解除。否則擬請將卅五年度箱茶，由茶商照原價加息購回、，自行推銷，旣可使國際市穩定，又能避免三十六年度高成本箱茶之損失云。典當業瀝叙七大理由　反對贖當取保辦法　　〔本報訊〕本市典當商業同業公會，因率警察局令飭運行限制十日內贖當取保修正辦法一案，該會同業，以是項政令，非特剝削絕大多數市民（當戶）自由，抑且妨礙該業全業生亦，業已　敍理山，據實函請市商會轉　市座撤銷，並請市參議會貫澈取銷是項禁令之原決議在案。該會昨日假座大西洋菜社，招待本市新聞界，陳述經過。茲將業所列舉之七大理由摘要如次：　　一，典當爲絕對物信用之民營金融機構，因其借貸手續簡便，習慣善良，確有協助國家，調劑平民經濟之效能。　　二，典當因與平民經濟息息相關，歷來政府對於本業，訂有管理專條，即已往亦無此種剝削當戶與業商自由之政策，更不應於今民主發端之日，有此措施。　　三，抄錄市民證，誠爲敵僞之暴政。今者國民身份證頒發未　，是　物者咸有預備具保之必要矣。　　四，國俗人情，旣以廉恥爲重，視典借爲羞惡。必欲強令宣示，是不啻摧殘優良習俗。　　五，本市軍政人員之過境，絡繹不絕，頗多找尋親友不遇，而致當物者，若必欲索閱抄錄其身份證，事實上確有不可能。　　六，本市貧苦小民如車夫小販等之晨當夕　，專恃典當以週濟其生活者，大有人在。若欲責令具保，何異絕其生機。　　七，此案目的，無非以防贓爲詞。査本業對於防贓，素極嚴密。即偶一被朦當入，則其銷贓得款目的已達，逍遙度日，奚必再　。而典當有當期兩月之久，儘可從容査吊。此防贓之效未騐，而擾民之害已深云。　　台糖謀對日輸出　　自政府對外匯管理新辦法頒佈後，中外出口商均呈活躍現象，台灣糖業公司爲拓展海外貿易，前曾向南洋各地輸往食糖，每月約有數百噸之鉅，並一度由中信局與麥帥總部接洽，再凖備對日輸出大批食糖，以爭取外匯。　　茲悉：該公司總經理沈鎮南氏，爲賡續接洽台糖輸日事宜，已於廿二日搭乘華聯輪由台省抵滬。據沈氏談，渠擬於下週晋京，逕向當局報吿公司業務，並向有關方而商洽台糖運日問題，如價格合宜，則本年內可能有「中砂」二萬五千噸運出，惟其價格希望不超出每磅美元一角二分云。　　又訊：前日糖市穩秀，台籍見緊。公會劃盤，廿九期棧單中砂白加六萬八千元至七萬二三千元，升一二萬元。四半白棧單爲七十九萬五千元，汕提靑五十二萬元，次之五十萬元。油赤五十六萬五千元，計百數包。興化白袋裝七十一萬元，　裝普通六十六萬元，興赤五十八萬元，次五十五萬元，成交二百餘件。刁青四十三萬五千元至四十三萬元，關四百餘包。紗布管制如何撤消　當局尚在慎重考慮　複製業與紡調會交換意見　　最近三數日，紗布市價，在紡建配紗價格維持原價之中，却不免上漲。大漲風雖屬有限，而業外人心，已有所激動。據業中人談稱，紗價並無上漲之理由，複製工業配紗，上週且有增加，本市需供，已較前潤澤。惟南運及北運限額，上週正在採辦一中，紗號配紗，開而復止，賑災附捐本星期內又即開始，市上人氣不免帶緊，故價格略漲。尤其爲布價疲落已久，最近數日始見回風，而核諸成本，其回上僅係够本作用。　　日來盛傅之紗布出口開禁及國內南遝北運特殊管制撤消二點。據當業某負責人透露消息，原則上可邀當局之同情的考慮。惟普遍開禁，須防刺激國內市價，必不可能。有限額的開禁，則可望做到。南北運特殊管制之撤銷，當與公棧制同時實行，而公棧制之如何方能優於限額運銷，尙在計劃中。以目前之情勢而言，放寬限額，予生產廠商以自然調節之機能，當爲最宜。聞前“複製業數巨頭曾邀請紡調會代主任委員劉泗英氏以次多人，廣泛交換意見。華南區主任呂谷凡氏亦被邀列席。均認爲在日本開放對外貿易聲中，紡調辦法，有多加考量之必要云。財政部公佈　印花稅檢查規則　（續一）　　（第一至第七條見十八日本報）　　第八條　各級檢査人員執行職務時，應先出示檢査證照，並以和平態度說明事由，　由被檢査者將應納印花稅之各種憑證交出，逐一檢査，對於在依法貼足印花稅票之憑證，應加蓋印花稅檢査章（印花稅督査員及抽査員私軍代替査章），交　收存。　　月檢査箱匣樹　內之憑證，應使被檢査者自行開啓取出，眼同檢查，如過拒絕，得由協助之　察設保甲長强制執行，其於妨害檢查情事，應由協助之警察或保甲長證明，並由在事檢査人員敍述要實，報請主管機關函請當地司法機關依法審理。　　第九件　各級檢查人員檢取　反印花稅法憑證，均應　給違反印花稅法憑證收據，交常事人收執，如因事實需要不能取件時，應由被檢査人出立違反印花稅法具結單，交檢査人員收執，憑以轉送司法機關審理。　　檢查人員如有擅自免罰或私擅處罰者，依法從重懲處。　　第十條　印花稅檢査員査獲違反印花稅法憑蹬，應分別註明這法情事，編列字號，於三日內報請該管機關長宜核閱。　　印花稅督査員査抽員或市縣政府兼辦印花稅檢査員査獲運反印花稅法憑證，應分別註明違法情事，編列字號，於五日內行文送交當地印花稅檢査機關審査。　　第十一條　審査違反印花稅法業件，應由機關長官指定高級職員三人以上會同審査，並應書具審在紀錄，於一週內辦理完畢，非經報明理由，不得無故積壓。　　第十二條　運反印花稅法憑證經審査屬實後，應逐一塡具違反印花稅法憑證說明單及査獲運反印花稅法案件淸册，連同違法憑證，一併備函移送違法憑證當事人所在地之司法機關審理。　　第十三條　經審査並無違反印花稅法情事之憑證，應由審査人員簽報該管機關長官核准發還，並應正式通知　憑證持有人或使用人限期憑收據領回，不得敗損或遺失。　　第十四條　印花稅檢査員或市縣政府兼辦印花稅檢査員於每天檢査憑證完畢後，應逐戶將檢査情形分別塡入檢査印花稅報吿表內，並報送該管檢査機關或市縣政府，市縣政府對於前項報吿表，應逐日核轉委託檢査機關査核，印花稅檢査機關應於次月十日以前，彙集上月檢査印花稅報吿表，報請印花稅抽査機關査核。　　各地査征所或稽征所應於次月五日以前，彙集上月檢査印花稅報吿表，報送該管上級機關彙報　　印花稅抽査機關應根據附屬機關所送檢査印花稅報告表，按月彙　　區檢査印花稅簡明表，報請印花稅督査發機關査核。　　白花稅督査員或抽査員應於督査或抽査一地印花稅工作完畢後十日，填眞督（抽）査某某局所印花稅報吿表，報請該督機關査核。　　第十五條　印花稅檢査機關及督査抽査人員，對於印花稅檢査員或兼辦印在稅檢査員工作努力成續優　者，應列舉事實，報請核獎，其有檢査不力或有凟職舞弊情事經査屬實者，除檢査機關逕予處分外，並視情節輕重，報請督査或抽査機關予以懲處，或移送司法機關訊辦。　　印花稅督査員或抽査員由各該督査或抽査機關予以考根獎懲。　　第十六條　本規則自公布日施行。（完）本市一週間　重要商品市價比較表（漲　跌）<

<p>春秋小遊船詩  洪爲法　　揚州續夢之二十一　　筆者前曾述及瘦西湖，至今仍不失爲揚州惟一遊覽之地，湖上遊人旣多，應運而生之遊船自然也多。撑遊船的船孃，是湖上的一些閑花野草。沾花惹草的遊人，現在固有，過去又如何能免？祗是過去的遊人比較風雅一些，這我們可以從「小遊船詩」中得窺大槪。　　「小遊船詩」，乃吾揚「面削瓜，骨介而貌和，不得志，益爲放達，冀釋其憂」（吉亮工小遊船詩序中語）之辛補芸漢清前輩所著，計絕句百首，寫於光緒已亥庚子兩年，其自序云：「揚州虹橋迤北爲長春湖，或曰瘦西湖，畫舫笙歌，在昔爲盛，風雲一變，人事遂遷。環湖漁家，近以瓜皮艇載客，夕陽明月，雲影波光，着一二亂頭粗服者於其間，綺語風情，半鳴天籟，雖非昔日美人名士之高懷，倘猶勝市儈滛娃之俗抱乎！」可見過去湖上遊人之與船孃廝混，即非高懷，亦異俗抱。　　辛先生歿於光緒壬寅之夏，此「小遊船詩」就在辛先生歿後由冶春後社諸同人醵資刊行的。筆者近從其哲嗣處得一鈔本，與刻本兩相校勘，詞句殊有異同。並且刻本中有絕句兩首：　　大家揮扇汗渾身，窄窄湖船十四人；一部石頭新記事，不分誰主與誰賓。　　午餐法海日西斜，子鴨清蒸大似鴉；饞得老饕生別計，豬頭分啖小銀家。　　爲鈔本所無，而鈔本中亦有絕句兩首：　　小金山過五亭橋，臭水河還走一遭；更喜今年新種菊，商量秋日去持螯。　　陸家姊妹自成行，跛足黃頭各擅塲；也欲引人來入勝，阿儂居在水雲鄉。　　爲刻本所無。是否在刊刻時因「臭水」「跛足」諸語過於誇飾其詞，遠非實况，遂另補兩首，或當時傳鈔即有異同，便不得而知了。　　小遊船即俗稱小划子。近時小划子形式，筆者已於船孃一文中述及，而在最初却非如此。小遊船詩刻本中有一首絕句：　　軒爽何須上有篷，送人來往夕陽中；頗聞划子喃喃語，悔作男兒應自宮！　　可見小划子最初是無篷的。至於由船孃撑的小划子生意興隆，妬煞男性船夫，則至於今日還是如此。　　當時的船孃，頗多名噪一時，爲風雅之士所激賞者，而那些船孃們對於一班風雅之士，也都服事殷勤，如：　　陸家莊在最西偏，剪韮留賓意特賢；飯值酒資何爛賤，只消六角小龍錢。（鈔本作「水雲鄉裏陸家莊，剪韮留賓意趣長；飯值酒資真爛賤，兩般六角小龍洋。」）　　籌馬洋錢色色齊，拈牌敍坐認東西；村姑餉客饒風味，白煮河魚醋溜鷄。　　詩狂那抵酒狂豪，濃墨淋漓蘸鼠毫；贏得美人親拂紙，一枝不律當舟操。（鈔本第一句「那抵」作「不及」，第四句作「風流祗合讓吾曹。」）　　爲愛名花第二株，阿誰引手試招呼；醉中狂極搴裳去，博得纖纖玉手扶。　　即從這幾首詩看，便知當時船孃之行徑，是真異於「滛娃之俗抱。」此外如：　　熟人相見亂呼名，索債添錢鬧不清；趣語撩人偏發狼，者般風氣亦多情。　　百般調笑百般嬌，柳外維舟爲避囂；纖手細拈蒼耳子，輕輕生怕髮飄蕭。　　擘蟹烹魚餍老饕，夜深歸去泛漁舫；女兒偏說遊人餓，蘸起浮萍水一篙。　　手抱船沿趙倚樓，謔言調笑惹嬌羞；簸揚真個身無主，欲採池蓮不自由。　　她們對於一班風雅之士打情罵俏，鬥趣撒嬌，頗類風塵知己，自會使人爲之傾倒，並且形於歌詠了。　　當時船孃中以蓮娘，轉娘，攩子，小蔚，巧姑等爲翹楚。至筆者常作湖上遊人時，則多已不見，賸下的如轉娘攩子輩，早是風華老去，再不爲遊人所矚目，這真是時光老人的冷酷。　　此外這班風雅之士，其行徑似亦與近年遊人不甚相同，如：　　鍾莊小憇倦遊踪，北郭尋春野興濃；一事絕奇真可笑，犬聲狂吠怕三恭。（鈔本「鍾」作「宗」）　　一詩，下有注云「客三揖而犬退，至今湖上艷稱之」。這十足表現出書迂的行徑，誰復再有如此的雅量呢？又如：　　鯽魚枉自買河干，枯柳無枝欲貫難；急煞於陵陳仲子，就烹何處可分餐。（鈔本作「鯽魚九尾虹橋買，枯柳無枝欲貫難；急煞於陵陳仲子，牟尼一串上河干。」）　　這是如何的落拓不拘，誰後有如此的雅趣呢？更如：　　何事橋東得得來，爲尋詩句幾徘徊，我儂消遣躭幽寂，易惹尋常一輩猜。　　這又是何等的雅人深致，恐尤非近年遊人所樂爲了。近年湖上，似已增加不少輕薄的情調，傖俗的氣氛，如從另一角度去看，或者也是一種社會上應有的變革，可是在筆者讀罷「小遊船詩」，想到幼年所見於諸前輩者，又何能免於悠然神往！詩家四關  朱雯　　四溟詩話，謂凡作近體，誦要好，聽要好，觀要好，講要好。誦之行雲流水，聽之金聲玉振，觀之明霞散綺，講之獨蘭抽絲，此詩家四關，使一關未過，則非佳句矣。此是篤論，學詩者當識之。頑貓阿咪（十）  張樂平作法庭  傅朗　　傅朗（Forian）是繼杜米埃（Daumier）之後的一個諷刺畫作家。　　善取現實題材，尤喜描寫社會黑暗面，諷刺入骨。　　此圖係描寫當時法國腐敗之法庭，色彩筆觸取光均極有趣，構圖尤其特殊。傅氏一生油繪極少，此圖可稱代表。　（劉獅）一寸山河一寸血　384  葉勁風　　老寨這一區，雖有佈置，也不過一種警報設備；惡客的光臨，照舊家常便飯，只要不是存心去探索老寨，這些連脈暗樁，也就聽其走路，彼此都不招惹。但寨子裏的人來人往，尤其是應行，必須一律服色，讓自己人一目了然，也必須全副武裝，以備不測。况且老寨的規矩，自己人如遭外人襲擊，抵敵不住，絕對不許往老寨逃避，必須突圍，或繞着山林向外走去，免得引鬼上門，妨害老寨的安全；所以全副武裝是必需的配備。　　這第四條小路，從小站到老寨，蜿蜒曲折，也有八九十里一大站距離，少說些也須兩小時的馳驟。頭半段人强馬壯，所以耀羣能够緊隨小老虎，揚鞭趨　；到了下半段這幾十里，耀羣雖然精於騎術，到底養息了些日子，有些跟不上，只好招呼小老虎放慢些脚程。　　小老虎却是愈跑愈有精神，每到一個暗崗所在，便打呼嘯，向暗崗遞暗號；一邊飛馳，一邊前後左右顧盼，防備意外。本來，他是胎裏帶來的武功，筋骨又練得那麼堅韌，騎術又精，如同長在馬背一樣，所以在他，這幾十里路的馳驟，好像競拔前，小小的筋骨活動而已，簡直不算一回事，只覺輕鬆痛快。　　這時聽見耀羣招呼，一時想起耀羣沒有練過手脚，且又隔了這些日子，沒有走馬，不能猛然這等奔騰；便起了一個新鮮主意，把馬繮一拎，兜回頭來，繞着耀羣盤旋，一邊對耀羣說：　　「紀姨，您儘管緩緩走着，反正沒多少路了，讓我試試這匹日本雜種，到底有多大能耐」。說着早一聲唱叱，雙襠一緊，那馬便如脫弦的弩箭一般，倒回頭朝來路馳去，不多一會兒，又翻身回頭，向耀羣這裏趕來；快到耀羣身邊，只聽見小老虎高聲說了句，「紀姨，這傢伙能跑……！」夾着一連串蹋蹬輕健蹄聲，一溜沙土揚起處，那馬已打耀羣旁邊擦身而過，一霎眼絕塵而去，再過一會，早跑的看不見影子了。　　耀羣打從小站上馬，一口氣跑了四五十里，雖說略乏，並不十分着累，不過打算放低速度，人馬暫緩一口氣，再行奔馳。然而經小老虎這們一來，不覺激起了競賽興味，便一鬆轡頭，輕輕喝了聲「走」！把馬鞭一揚，在空氣裏呼呼到了兩響，那馬早已揚頭奮蹄，追風逐雲似的，也馳騁了起來。　　一晃眼，剛跑了約莫三五里地，只見極日遠處，捲起一陣塵土，旋風一般，對準這裏，疾馳而來；耀羣先還以爲是小老虎折了回頭，再一定睛，却又依約看出似乎不止一人一騎，心下有些奇怪，下意識地把繮繩勒了一勒。那馬跑發了勢，經這猛然一勒，收勢不住，勉强倒挫兩步，前蹄踏空，人立起來；實因蹄子跑得太熱，剛一放下前蹄，就勢在當地打起磨旋來。耀羣一邊控着馬勢，一伏一起，一邊早已聽見遠處空穀傳來回去，蹄聲雜沓，確定來騎，至少在兩乘以上。社會服務申報與人和合辦第一屆貧婦免費助產槪况　　本報與華山路香山路人和醫院及紅十字會第一醫院聯合舉辦之貧婦助產運動，第一屆定期六個月，自本年二月九日開始，至八月九日業告期滿總計申請之貧婦前後共八十四人，經本館派員調查證明家境確屬清寒予以核准者，計達六十三人，其中除少數自願放棄外，前往上開二院平安生產者計人和醫院卅八人，紅十字會第一醫院三人，經醫師檢查體格，正在待產中者，共計十九人，總計六個月內，收到各方捐款一千五百七十五萬九千元，其中人和醫院卅八人，共費六百〇四萬二千五百十元，紅十字會第一醫院三人共費九十四萬元，迄目前爲止，結存八百七十七萬六千五百元。　　自本報倡導貧婦助產運動以來，迭蒙各方善士踴躍捐輸，致使此項善舉，歷久不輟。而一般貧苦產婦，均賴以獲得完善合理之接生照料，差堪告慰於讀者。第二屆於八月十日起繼續辦理。凡家境清寒之產婦，可申請救濟，同時盼海上善士，不斷輸將，庶幾此項善舉，日益擴大，裨益社會，功德無量。郵政問答　　本局茲收到（一）上海一市民（二）任　君（三）武進馮　君來函詢問特就所提各點，簡答如下：　　（答）：（一）總局公衆服務課轉下大函，茲答復如下：甲·四川北路支局辦公時間規定至下午六時半止，有木牌懸掛，所稱下午七時，想係誤會。乙·本局所裝電鐘，隨母鐘轉動，（並非屋頂大鐘），本不至參差，惟因裝置年久，機件容有損蝕，現已修理改正，並規定每日照標準時間將母鐘核準，每二週將各子鐘校正一次。丙·此點請向儲匯局接洽　　（二）甲·前因杭徽公路橋樑尚多損壞每日限帶郵件十公斤，無法順此路綫。現已修復，寄皖南屯溪歙縣一帶郵件，均改發杭州轉遞。乙·已函安徽管理局辦理。丙·代辦所係商人兼辦郵務，並非郵政人員，待遇問題，在縝密考慮中。　　（三）甲·匯費分特別組及普通組二種，特別組基本費收千分之一，補水費隨時升縮。普通組基本費每元一分，特補費每元四分，補水費隨時升縮。故雖有規定，而收費各異。乙·信內不得夾帶法幣。丙·代辦所不得向寄信人收手續費。　　（代郵）（一）杭州韻君：寄上宋溎潮君函，內封法幣三萬元，因地址有誤，無法投遞，請向杭州郵局營業處洽領。（二）周家嘴路方潤葉君：承索分區投遞圖表，請示詳細地址，以便寄奉。公衆服務組</p>

，　壞其神經系統，使人於　　狀態，　　之大，可想而知。他們用來擾亂雷達信號的方法有兩種：　　第一種是用　　附在與敵人頻牽相同之電波　　出，用以擾亂敵人所收到的信號。　的頻率用以對付敵人的預告設備，高的頻率用於對付探照燈，地面砲火等的雷達設備，為了使用上的便利起見，每一　擾亂發射機須要有極寬的調配範圍，　是　要有一　設備，即可擾亂人極多的雷達綱，此種發射機　可　置於飛機之上。　　　　　進入敵人的　收顯示器後，使得雷達上的光峯碎亂成一條條分散的火綫，敵人所能得到的　　完全喪失，如果是一隊　雷達控制的　射砲火，非天氣晴朗，視綫能及以外，其效用等於零。至於　　的來源，最　英國用的是一種二極管，　用九百卅一　　雷管，後來也　用　　的　　　的。　　第二種方法是使敵人收到假造的反射信號，方法極簡單，然而效力頗大，用極　的鋁片為反射體，在飛機上散佈下來，　千片八分之一英寸之鋁片，其反對之信號相同於一　　　機一般。所以，假使少數的飛機而散佈大量的鋁片，敵人雷達與　　上所得的信號，卻為大隊飛機光臨，非但可以擾亂敵人的軍心，而且可以掩護少數飛機通過敵境。　軍登陸諾曼第以前，常用少數飛機滿載大量鋁片在德人佔領之港口上散佈，　各地的德軍司令長官均以為有登陸此地的可能，利用此種錯覺取得了　北極大的勝利。　　「一物必有一尅」。想不到靈活的雷達也有牠的尅星。恐怖的原子炸彈有沒有防禦的方法呢？</p>

<h3>Wei Envoy Issues Candid Statement Offering Opinions on Reform for Our Nation; Government Will Surely Gain Popular Support If Reforms Are Vigorously Implemented; If the Chinese Communists Truly Love the Country, They Should Abandon Armed Force</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] The U.S. Embassy today released Special Envoy Wedemeyer's statement upon leaving China. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>"As I initially promised to the press, we have conducted investigations into the economic, political, military, and social conditions with an attitude free from any constraints or preconceptions. Everyone in our group has strived to be objective and fair. To achieve this goal, we have traveled extensively, including to Shenyang and Fushun in the Northeast; Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Jinan in North China; Nanjing and Hankou in Central China; and Guangzhou and Taiwan in South China, to avoid being unduly influenced by any single region.</p>
<p>We have made successful efforts to make contact with people of all classes and backgrounds. We have categorized them by their economic status, cultural achievements, and differing political viewpoints. Foreign merchants and officials have also met with me. We have also met with government and local officials, as well as personnel from various political groups, including many who frankly criticized the government and held extremely leftist views. We have received over two thousand letters, a small portion of which were anonymous. These letters included many suggestions that have greatly benefited us.</p>
<p>During our final week in China, our work has primarily focused on analyzing the vast amount of information we have gathered on political, economic, and other fronts, in order to arrive at accurate judgments and conclusions. Although opinions vary, one point is universally shared: in turbulent China, the Chinese people all yearn for peace—early peace and lasting peace. I firmly believe that the means to achieve peace are equally evident.</p>
<p>After the surrender of Japan, the Chinese people rightfully hoped to enjoy the fruits of their hard-won victory. They endured hardship and danger in the effort to expel the brutal invaders, and suffered indescribable suffering. In today's China, what we see in many ways is an attitude of indifference, neither seeking to solve problems nor spending considerable time and energy blaming external influences or seeking external aid. Many Chinese, originally highly capable and patriotic, who should be full of hope and determination, are now filled with demoralizing defeatism. It is disheartening to say the least! Despite years of war and revolution hindering and weakening China, it still possesses most of the resources to undertake its own reconstruction. China's revival depends on wise leadership and a moral and spiritual rebirth, and these factors can only be found within China.</p>
<p>While I fully understand the interests and problems of specifically designated individuals or groups, I am also deeply concerned about the overall welfare of the Chinese people. I firmly believe that if the Chinese Communists are sincerely patriotic and concerned about the country's welfare, they should voluntarily abandon their efforts to achieve their ideology through force. If they genuinely want to help the Chinese people, they should also replace the regrettable violence and destruction of the past few months with peaceful means. If corrupt or incompetent officials in key positions (especially in provincial and municipal institutions, not just within the government organization) can be removed, the current central government will certainly be able to gain and retain the unanimous and enthusiastic support of the majority of the people. This point is of equal importance.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of outstanding officials who demonstrate superior efficiency and dedication, and who live on their meager salaries and legitimate private property. Similarly, there are also conscientious businessmen who are quite capable of abiding by commercial ethics, but I emphasize that the multitude of corrupt or incompetent officials, or those who are both corrupt and incompetent, should leave no room for misunderstanding.</p>
<p>To regain and maintain the faith of the Chinese people, the central government should immediately implement rigorous and far-reaching political and economic reforms. Mere promises will not suffice; demonstrable action is absolutely necessary. Force alone cannot eradicate communism; this point must be accepted.</p>
<p>As our group and I depart China, we express our sincere gratitude to President Chiang and all the patriotic Chinese people we have met for their assistance. We are also deeply grateful for the courteous treatment we have received from all parties. All Americans hope that China will achieve the unity, prosperity, and happiness that the Chinese people deserve and have seemed to have lost for many years."</p>
<h3>Wedemeyer Flies to Tokyo; Will Go to Korea Tomorrow for Second-Stage Investigation; Before Leaving Nanjing, Visited President and Mrs. Chiang for a Long Talk</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo Dispatch on the 24th] General Wedemeyer, who is investigating the facts, arrived in Tokyo on the 24th and plans to confer with MacArthur before proceeding to Korea to begin the second stage of the investigation. Wedemeyer arrived at Haneda Airport at 3:35 PM on the 24th. Those who went to the airport to welcome him included Sebald, chairman of the Allied Council for Japan, General Shang Wei, representative of the Chinese Allied Council for Japan, and Colonel Penkell, aide to MacArthur.</p>
<p>Wedemeyer plans to go to Korea on the 26th and will stay there for eight or ten days. A spokesman for Wedemeyer said that the purpose of the trip to Tokyo is to obtain from MacArthur a summary of the situation in Korea. After the trip to Korea, Wedemeyer will return to Tokyo for a short stay, after which he will return to the United States.</p>
<p>Observers believe that MacArthur and Wedemeyer will discuss Japan's possible role in preventing the spread of communism. According to them, Japan, which has traditionally feared Russian aggression, may be willing to cooperate in the anti-communist ideological front in China, Japan, and Korea. It has been pointed out that the Wedemeyer mission is closely related to the Marshall Plan for Europe, and that Wedemeyer is inclined to recommend supervised aid to the "non-communist areas" of China. Like China, Korea is dominated by communist groups in the northern regions, and Wedemeyer's biggest problem is expected to be planning the best way to help the people in the U.S.-occupied area of South Korea. Korea is also under MacArthur's command.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] Wedemeyer and his mission left Nanjing by plane for Japan and then Korea on the morning of the 24th. Those who went to the airport to see him off included Wu Dingchang (representing President Chiang), Gan Naikang (representing Premier Zhang), Liu Shi Shun (representing Foreign Minister Wang), Bai Chongxi, Chen Cheng, Weng Wenhao, Yu Dawei, Shen Yi, Gui Yongqing, Zhou Zhirou, Wu Siyu, Liu Naifan, Ling Qihan, Wang Jizhen, Yu Bin, Zhou Hongchong, Pan Chaoying, and more than a hundred officers from the U.S. Embassy and the U.S. Military Advisory Group. At about 8 a.m., accompanied by Ambassador Stuart, Wedemeyer drove to President Chiang's residence on Huangpu Road to bid farewell to President and Mrs. Chiang, talking for about an hour. Arriving at Daxiaochang Airport at 9:20 a.m., he reviewed the honor guard and shook hands with each of those who came to see him off before boarding the plane. At 9:45 a.m., the Constellation aircraft broke through the clouds and soared into the sky. As Wedemeyer stood on the handrail of the boarding ladder, he directly called out Stuart's name: "Thank you for your help over the past month," and offered his blessings before departing. In the final moment of farewell to each of those who welcomed him, Wedemeyer frequently waved from inside the plane window. Wedemeyer arrived in Nanjing on July 22 and stayed in China for one month and two days before departing on the 24th.</p>

<h3>Wei Envoy Hopes We Eradicate Corruption; All Parties Share the Same Sentiment; Chen Yaodong Says This Has Always Been the Proposition of the Political Consultative Council</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] Councilor Chen Yaodong commented on Wedemeyer's statement on the 24th, saying that the opinions expressed by Wedemeyer have always been the propositions of the Political Consultative Council, but the executors have failed to adopt them, causing our domestic affairs to be further elaborated by friendly countries, which is worthy of our deep reflection. Wedemeyer hopes that our country can eradicate corruption. In fact, the reorganization of governance should start from the local level, because local officials are close to the people, and if there are problems with their integrity, the people will be directly harmed. At present, corruption is rampant and bribery is prevalent, so it is necessary to eradicate it.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] A certain leader of the Democratic Socialist Party commented on Wedemeyer's farewell remarks on the 24th, saying that Wedemeyer's words are very sincere. His hope that China can reflect on itself coincides with our long-standing advocacy of "self-reliance." The points regarding corruption, etc., are also the current reality and should be urgently rectified. As for the Chinese Communist issue, the party's position has been seen in the Common Administrative Program. In other words, a political solution is still the basic policy.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] Youth Party Committee Member Yu Jiaju commented on General Wedemeyer's farewell message on the 24th, saying that what Wedemeyer said in his statement, "If the Chinese Communists truly put the country's happiness first, they should be willing to stop using force to achieve their ideology," is indeed true, but it is a pity that the Chinese Communists do not have such ambitions! Wedemeyer hopes that the central and local governments can be reformed. We also share this sentiment, because if politics is unsound, it will affect morale and public sentiment. As for what Wedemeyer said, "China still possesses the natural resources needed for national construction, so it should reflect on itself," it is not that we do not seek to work hard and strive for self-improvement, but after eight years of war against Japan and in the midst of long-term revolutionary disasters, some aspects have become unbalanced, and world security is indivisible. For the sake of the future of the world, the United States should provide more assistance in construction.</p>
<h3>Neutral Observers on the Issue of U.S. Aid to China</h3>
<p>[United Press Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] The release of Wedemeyer's candid statement has led neutral observers to the following conclusions:</p>
<p>First, the possibility of large-scale political loans from the United States to China is out of the question in the short term.</p>
<p>Second, any direct action is unlikely before the U.S. Congress reconvenes in January next year, as there is nothing in Wedemeyer's message that warrants calling a special session of Congress.</p>
<p>Third, any financial or military assistance to China will be conditional on President Chiang allowing the United States to closely supervise and control the supply and planning of funds.</p>
<p>It is generally known that President Chiang personally suggested to Wedemeyer that U.S. advisors cooperate with Chinese officials in economic, political, and military aspects to open the door to "controlled" U.S. aid. Observers here believe that even this plan may be welcomed by Congress.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Stuart to Visit Yanjing University Soon to Inspect School Affairs</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] After Wedemeyer and his party left Beijing, Ambassador Stuart told our reporter that he will go to Beijing in the near future to inspect the affairs of Yanjing University and preside over the opening ceremony on September 8. The Ambassador looked slightly thinner than before, but when answering reporters' questions, he said that he had not been too busy recently. He declined to judge whether Wedemeyer's work was extremely successful, but said that Wedemeyer's work was extremely hard.</p>
<h3>Seeing Off Special Envoy Wedemeyer</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Pu Dejie</p>
<p>If Special Envoy Wedemeyer came to China in a frenzy, then the atmosphere when he left was completely refreshing, refreshing weather, refreshing mood.</p>
<p>On the morning of August 24, the refreshing autumn breeze blew the gray and white sails of the clouds, and the passion of summer was near Lanshan. At Daxiaochang Airport, beside the Constellation aircraft, stood people who were leaving and people who came to see them off. Except for General Wei, who was accompanied by Ambassador Stuart to bid farewell to President and Mrs. Chiang, most of the people who were there on the 22nd of last month were there. Political Advisor Mr. Sprouse and his companions and friends of the embassy were taking pictures, Engineering Advisor Rear Admiral Cooke and Minister Yu Dawei, holding a khaki hat, were chatting, and News Advisor Mr. Watson accepted "safe travels" from every Chinese reporter and foreign reporter. A colleague suggested that everyone take a photo with him, but all the photographers were concentrated on the left side of the plane, waiting from one end of the honor guard to the other. Wu Hanmin (translator) and Secretary General Gan Naikang walked over talking all the way.</p>
<p>The black car with the stars and stripes came, and Ambassador Stuart and General Wedemeyer got out one after another, inspected the honor guard with big steps, and walked towards the crowd of well-wishers, followed by countless "safe travels," tight handshakes, and sincere "thank yous." An embassy official kissed his wife goodbye and boarded the plane. General Wei began to say goodbye to the friends of the embassy and the advisory group one by one, and then he took the ambassador's hand and talked in a low voice for a few words. From his expression, one could see sincere gratitude. He walked up the handrail and turned around to wave the grass hat in his hand. Finally, the silver door of the plane, painted with three red stripes, covered his slender back.</p>
<p>At 9:30, the Ninth-Four-One-Four-Nine Constellation special plane, in everyone's farewell waves, slid into the runway. Twenty minutes later, its powerful four propellers shattered the low-pressure clouds and rushed into the clear sky. The people at the airport also dispersed.</p>
<p>"At Daxiaochang Airport, we have welcomed and sent off many people... Each welcome or send-off represents the beginning or end of a stage in politics." But after reading General Wei's sincere and frank departure certificate, we feel that this send-off does not represent the end. From his arrival to his departure, the thirty-three days have just raised the curtain. He told us that what we have to do is "to start anew with the people."</p>
<h3>In Coordination with the General Mobilization Order, the Representatives Conference of Various Provinces and Cities in North China Has Formulated Emergency Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 24th] The Beiping Pacification Headquarters convened representatives from various provinces and cities for a meeting in recent days, and has formulated an emergency measures plan to coordinate with the general mobilization order, which will be implemented after approval by the central government. The main points are: (1) Strengthen the powers of the Pacification Headquarters, which can conveniently command the subordinate pacification offices, provincial and municipal governments, and central government agencies stationed in the area, and resolve matters locally. (2) In military affairs, strengthen the local armed forces and use corps under the unified command of the Headquarters. (3) Simplify provincial and municipal administrative agencies, and abolish departments such as land and food, society, health, and land administration, as well as redundant agencies. (4) Financially, when necessary, the Headquarters may order state-owned factories and enterprises such as the Changlu Salt Bureau, the Customs and Mining Bureau, and the China Textile Company to pay taxes to make up for the shortfall.</p>
<h3>After Acheson's Death in Plane Crash, Japanese Peace Conference to Be Postponed; U.S. Conducts Diplomatic Offensive Against Soviet Union in China, Japan, and Korea</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo Dispatch on the 24th] The death of Acheson, chairman of the Allied Council for Japan, will postpone the Japanese peace conference until after November 11, or November. The world is now paying attention to the U.S. Navy's search for top-secret documents regarding the Japanese peace treaty, but the Central News Agency reporter has learned that Acheson himself was the key to solving many problems, and the United States' information on these issues has not yet been finalized. Even the most confidential documents could not include it. Much of the information was given orally. For this reason, the State Department must appoint someone to fill Acheson's position as an unfortunate diplomat whose position in the occupied Japan matters was second only to that of General MacArthur, and the person who succeeds to the position must first learn the information and detailed opinions that the Supreme Authority of the occupation intends to convey to the Washington authorities. Possible successors may be Seabold, deputy chief of the diplomatic branch of the Allied Headquarters who has been acting as proxy for Acheson in the Allied Council for Japan and its service affairs in Japan for the past year, but prestige and experience in the diplomatic field are very important, so other officials in the State Department with diplomatic experience, such as Stanton, the former U.S. Consul General in Shanghai and the current U.S. Minister to Siam, may also be successors. However, Acheson's successor will take at least a month or six weeks to be decided.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington Dispatch on the 24th] According to sources in authority, the aim of the U.S. diplomatic offensive against the Soviet Union is to take the initiative into the hands of the United States. Beginning on the 24th, it has been conducted on the three major fronts of China, Japan, and Korea. The most recent action in this approach was the United States' re-protest to the Soviet Union against the ban on international ships importing into Port Dalian, as seen in. The recent U.S. note to the Soviet Union is the same as the one sent to the Soviet Union on January 3 of this year, with one exception: the United States frankly stated that if the Soviet Union refuses to abide by the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance of August 14, 1945, then the Soviet Union shall be responsible for American property and nationals in Dalian. On the other two fronts, the U.S. diplomatic offensive is aimed at demanding progress from the Soviet-American Joint Commission on Korea and frankly rejecting the Soviet Union's demand that the Japanese peace treaty should be drafted by the four powers.</p>
<p>In mid-September, after Wedemeyer returns to the United States from his investigation of China and other parts of the Far East, the general policy of the United States toward the Chinese National Government is expected to be clarified.</p>
<p>According to authoritative sources, the United States is unlikely to change its China policy and appease the Chinese Communists. The deterioration of US-Soviet relations will inevitably cause unfavorable repercussions for the Chinese Communists.</p>
<h3>Members of the Council for Deliberation on the Japanese Peace Treaty Have Been Appointed</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has established a Council for Deliberation on the Japanese Peace Treaty for the purpose of drafting a Japanese peace treaty. In addition to some senior officials of the Ministry serving as members, experts on Japanese issues outside the Ministry have also been invited to serve. It is reported that letters of appointment have been issued and a meeting will be convened soon to begin work.</p>
<h3>New Military Officer Education: Eight Principles Determined</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] According to the Military News Agency, the new military officer education system has been discussed by various relevant units, and eight principles have been determined and will be implemented soon: (1) Improve officers' knowledge of natural science. (2) Cultivate unified commanders and staff for the army, navy, and air force. (3) Pay attention to joint logistics cadre training and establish a unified joint logistics organization. (4) Strengthen specialized technical training so that all scientific developments can be applied to military affairs. (5) Coordinate academic qualifications with age and experience so that knowledge can be applied to teaching. (6) Take into account both experience and academic qualifications, and attach equal importance to staff and field positions. (7) Enforce the enrollment system, eliminate officers layer by layer, in order to select outstanding officers. (8) Appropriately cultivate officers to meet the needs of the mobilization order.</p>
<h3>Pingjinji Supervision Group Determined to Punish Corruption</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Beiping Dispatch on the 24th] The Pingjinji Military Discipline and Official Governance Supervision Group was formally established in Ping on the 24th after extensive preparations by the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, Baoding Pacification Office, and various public opinion organizations. It also held its first State Affairs Meeting and stipulated a work plan, which will begin on the 25th. The person in charge of the group said that they have the greatest determination to punish corruption, and officials found to have committed corruption will be dealt with according to law once they are discovered.</p>
<h3>Party Members Brutally Killed by Communist Bandits; China Harmony Party Cables Request to Punish the Culprits</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency this City Dispatch] The China Harmony Party held an emergency meeting on the evening of the 23rd because its Haimen Branch Director Shen Xizhen and General Affairs Section Chief Shi Wenhan were brutally killed by armed Communist personnel. They unanimously passed a resolution to be sent to the National Government, requesting that the culprits be punished to uphold human rights. At the same time, a telegram was sent to Mao Zedong to investigate responsibility.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong - Above Paradise - One of the Southern Travel Jottings -</h3>
<p>— Bu Shaofu</p>
<p>A reporter traveled from Shanghai to Beijing on July 23rd to participate in a South China visit with colleagues from Beijing and Shanghai. The group totaled eight people. On the 25th, they flew from Beijing to Hankou. On the afternoon of the 28th, they took the Guangdong-Hankou train to Changsha, arriving on the 29th. They stayed in Changsha for three days, departing for Hengyang on August 1st and arriving on the evening of the 2nd. After spending the night, they left Hengyang the following evening. They stopped in Yingde for four hours and arrived in Guangzhou at 9:00 AM on the 5th. On the 9th, they flew from Guangzhou to Hainan Island, returning on the 12th. On the 14th, they took the Guangzhou-Kowloon train to Hong Kong, returning to Guangzhou on the 19th and flying back to Shanghai on the 21st. This trip lasted a total of 28 days, with footprints across six major cities: Hankou, Changsha, Hengyang, Guangzhou, Haikou, and Hong Kong. Although the journey was hurried and inevitably superficial, there was much to observe that could be used for reference and research. I will now record my personal observations in separate articles below, seeking the guidance of knowledgeable gentlemen at home and abroad.</p>
<p>There is such a joke:</p>
<p>"A British soldier stationed in Hong Kong, after dying, approached Heaven and angrily knocked on the gates. The officer in charge of Heaven opened the door and asked the reason. The British soldier said he wanted to enter Heaven. The officer asked, 'Where do you come from? What do you do?' The British soldier told the truth. The officer said: 'A person like you, in a place like that, why do you still need to enter Heaven?'"</p>
<p>Hong Kong, a place above paradise for British royal personnel, after reading today's reports on the living conditions of the British Isles, we no longer believe this is a joke.</p>
<p>In the two years since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Hong Kong has undergone tremendous changes. Ultimately, India is now independent, yet Hong Kong remains a shining jewel in the crown of the British Empire. It is prosperous, with a population of 1.6 million (110,000 more than the highest wartime count). It nourishes the British Empire (silver and bronze subsidiary coins have disappeared, and newly issued paper subsidiary coins are only printed on one side. As for the total amount of Hong Kong dollars issued, who knows?). It is colorful, complex, contradictory, and also bizarre.</p>
<p>After leaving the second floor of Gloucester Building, one can easily encounter people of various identities who cannot gain a foothold in the mainland. Large-scale smuggling organizations are active, and forwarding companies solicit business, allowing one to pay 50% of the cargo price as a guarantee. Fluid capital concentrates, overseas remittances concentrate, building the prosperity of Queen's Road in Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>Colorful, complex, contradictory, and bizarre aspects are reflected in the eye-catching colors of clothing worn by pedestrians on the street, so superficial and easily faded! Reflected in the "Miss Hong Kong" election is the selection of a mother of two children from among four women. Reflected in the collapse of a bank is only the lack of HK$1.5 million in short-term financing. Reflected in the newly opened afternoon newspaper being sold all over the streets at 11:00 AM. Reflected in morality cases where two "throwing girls" are arrested and fined for the crime of "obstruction" (meaning obstructing traffic).</p>
<p>I arrived in Hong Kong on the eve of the Hong Kong Chinese Mechanics Association's strike of the thirteen departments of machine workers. At that time, the Chinese Mechanics Association had issued a final ultimatum, giving the capitalists 24 hours to respond, or else they would strike. At 5:00 PM on the 15th, the deadline of the ultimatum expired, and the action began. One Hong Kong evening newspaper even temporarily published a special edition, using the name "Second Edition" to avoid provoking the situation. People in Hong Kong had long been panicking, filling bathtubs and buckets with water. Rice, firewood, oil, kerosene, and candles were also hoarded in large quantities. They either knew about the Guangzhou-Hong Kong general strike of 1920 or had experienced the taste of falling into enemy hands before 1941. Everyone was clever and alert, fearing the interruption of electricity and water, and prices jumped suddenly. Rice, the "golden coin" Silky Rice, rose to $88 per picul, and gold stocks showed a major downward trend.</p>
<p>However, until the day the reporter left Hong Kong (August 19th), the water, electricity, and transportation workers did not participate. Life in Hong Kong was not fatally suffocated. The weekend dances at the Peninsula Hotel and the waitresses at the Tai Tung Restaurant still attracted Chinese and foreign gentlemen and their soaring excitement. It turned out that the Labor Bureau of the Hong Kong government had its clever plan, and the capitalists of the Kowloon, Navy, and Taikoo Dockyards naturally did not need to be tough.</p>
<p>What is the clever plan to open? That requires investigating the organization and background of various unions in Hong Kong, and why the water, electricity, and transportation unions did not participate in this wage increase campaign. This issue is not simple, and this lack of simplicity may be one of the factors that constitute "above paradise." In short, those who understand the inside story of the ending of the thirteen departments of machine workers' strike will know that it will end in a low amount of payment.</p>
<p>Merchants have their suffering. They are complacent about this golden opportunity before the restriction, but they are even more anxious to seek a path to wealth that cannot be found. Hong Kong is flooded with fluid capital, and bank loans are mostly interest-free, and even depositors have to pay handling fees. The severity of domestic import restrictions and the difficulty of settling foreign exchange force them to feel like they are lying in piles of money, enduring hunger and swallowing saliva. Before our government announced changes to foreign exchange settlement and import-export trade measures on the 17th, overseas Chinese merchants had planned to organize a large-scale operating institution to trade with the mainland, adopting a barter method, hoping to break the paralyzed state of Hong Kong's import and export trade in the past two months. Now that our government has announced the revised measures, and the Sino-Hong Kong financial agreement is also nearing the time of promulgation, Hong Kong's commerce can slightly move into the right track.</p>
<p>Distorted prosperity has its limits. If there is a blockade line between China and Hong Kong, let alone prosperity, even survival would be a big problem. The Hong Kong government knows this very clearly, and our government should not fail to know it clearly either. If our government knows it very clearly, our negotiations on the economic front must abandon "Bund diplomacy" and fill this loophole with reinforced concrete.</p>
<p>On the 13th, the Hong Kong News section of the Sing Tao Daily had this paragraph of news:</p>
<p>"Next to the Tiger Balm Garden in Tai Hang, there is a small stream. The stream water is clear and cold, and children often gather to play. On the morning of the previous day (the 11th), four people dressed as students went to play in the mountain pit. As soon as they were playing, several child bandits robbed the students of their ink pens and money. In the afternoon of the same day, several other students went to play in the area and were again robbed of their valuables by the group of child bandits. The students, unwilling to lose their belongings, resisted slightly and were beaten by the child bandits. They shouted loudly for help, but by the time the police arrived, the child bandits had already fled without a trace." A friend - who has lived in Hong Kong for two years - said to me:</p>
<p>"Although living in Hong Kong is quite comfortable, it always feels like something is missing."</p>
<p>Hong Kong, how do we view it? With what kind of identity do we view it?</p>

<h3>Southern Henan Recovers Runan and Xincai - Remnant Bandits Have Fallen Into the National Army's Pocket-Shaped Encirclement - Western Henan Bandits Cross the River and Invade Luoyang, Martial Law Imposed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xuzhou 24th Dispatch] The remnant troops of the Communist bandit Liu Bocheng in southern Henan have become rats in a sack. The National Army is launching a pincer attack from the north and south to surround and annihilate Liu's bandits. The northern National Army recovered Runan and Xincai on the 23rd, and is pursuing the bandits south of the Ru River. Liu's 1st and 7th Columns launched an attack on Runanbu on the evening of the 23rd, but were repelled by the National Army. The National Army in Yingshang Yang is dividing its forces to suppress and annihilate Liu's 6th Column of bandits in Sanhejian and Huanggang Temple. Liu Bocheng is leading his 2nd and 3rd Columns and is still wandering around the areas of Xinjiu Southeast Island, Majiaji, and Baoji, etc. The Southern National Army is advancing north from Zhenchuan and Gushi. At the moment, the remnant troops of Liu's 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 7th Columns have fallen into the National Army's pocket-shaped encirclement in the triangle area of the Ru River and the Huai River.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Bengbu 24th Dispatch] The remnant bandits who crossed the river from Sanhejian Cangji, on the 23rd, scurried into Gushi territory. The National Army is following closely behind. The bandits' 1st and 7th Columns scurried to the north bank of the Huai River in southern Henan and divided into several crossing points. One group crossed the river and appears to be heading west towards Xinyang. The Pingzhi Road National Army is on alert.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Luoyang 24th Dispatch] Luoyang City, in order to consolidate its city defense and maintain public order, announced the imposition of martial law starting from the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Luoyang 24th Dispatch] On the night of the 22nd, Communist bandits simultaneously crossed the river in the areas along the river in Xin'an, Mianchi, and Shanxian in western Henan. The first to cross south was Huijin Town east of Shanzhou. By noon on the 23rd, more than 2,000 bandits had crossed the river and were engaged in fierce fighting with our garrison troops. However, due to the disparity in numbers, both sides suffered casualties. The situation in Huiyuzhen at noon is unclear. Another group of Communist bandits scurried south towards the area south of the Gonglu Road. At the moment, they have already reached Caijiashi. More follow-up troops are crossing the river. The section of the Gonglu Road between Huiyuzhen and Jiaokou has been destroyed, and traffic is obstructed. The city walls of Shanxian are safe and sound as of the evening of the 23rd. The military and civilians have mobilized together. However, the situation regarding the deployment of defenses against bandits is quite tense. Xicangji, west of Mengjin and bordering the river, was captured by bandits on the 22nd. Our water reserve team of 500-600 people rushed to suppress and annihilate them and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. In this forced crossing of the river by bandits, our local troops in Xin'an, Mianchi, and Shanxian fought bravely, despite being outnumbered, to block their advance. Although our civilian army suffered casualties, the Communist bandits also suffered a great blow. By the afternoon of the 23rd, our National Army had arrived in succession and made effective deployments. The Communist bandits who crossed the river will definitely not succeed.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xi'an 24th Dispatch] Several bridges on the Longhai Railway east of the Shanzhou Station, from Zhangjiazhuang to Zixingzhen, have been destroyed. The bus from Xi'an to Luoyang safely returned yesterday. Today, the eastbound train only reaches Lingbao Pass.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Taiyuan 23rd Dispatch] Communist bandits are gathering in the area bordering Shanxi and Henan, actively preparing to cross the river and invade Henan. Chen Congying's troops are stationed in Xiaodiantou northwest of Jiyuan. The 10th, 11th, and 13th Brigades and local troops he leads, totaling more than 20,000 people, are stationed in the area around Xiwangzhuang Town in Jiyuan. The 25th, 26th, and 27th Brigades of bandits west of Bo'ai also moved west to the vicinity of Wangwu on the 19th. They have already obtained more than 70,000 sheepskin bags for crossing the river in Jiyuan. Boatmen from various counties along the river in southern Shanxi are being sent to the ferries of Yishi and Yuxiang for training. Carpenters from various counties are also rushing to build boats.</p>
<h3>Three National Army Routes in Jiaodong Advance to the Suburbs of Pingdu City - Remnant Bandits Between Heze and Juye in Western Shandong Are Eliminated</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Taiyuan 23rd Dispatch] The Battle of Pingdu is the prelude to the Jiaodong campaign. The National Army is advancing from Jimo, Gaomi, and Changi respectively. The progress in the past three days has been extremely cautious. The resistance from the Communist bandits has been weak. The National Army advancing north from Gaomi in the central route captured Tingkou, 50 li north of Gaomi, yesterday. At 9:00 PM that night, they continued to advance 40 li, crossed Hejia Dian, and reached the suburbs of Pingdu City. The Jimo National Army on the right also crossed Liuzhuang and advanced to the suburbs of the city. The Communist bandits reinforced from Gaowang Mountain and engaged in fierce fighting. The fighting is still underway. Gaowang Mountain, Dazhu Mountain, and Juchi Mountain are actually the main bases of the Communist bandits in Jiaodong. If the National Army attacks Pingdu, the gateway to Jiaodong will be wide open.</p>

<h3>Cruel Atrocities of Communist Bandits in the Wuqing and Xianghe Areas</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tianjin 24th Dispatch] Refugees from Wuqing who came to Tianjin said: The Communist bandits in the Wuqing and Xianghe areas have recently intensified their trampling of the people. The "Farmers' Association," "Women's Association," and "Children's Garden" in each village have all been formed under the direction of the Communist bandits. Villagers with any assets cannot escape struggle. The method of struggle is to drag the person being struggled to a platform made of wooden boards and first make them "confess." Then, the "Children's Garden" beats them painfully with sticks. They are beaten until they are half dead and then sprayed awake with cold water. This is repeated until they are dead. The Children's Garden is composed of children aged seven to sixteen. Usually, when they go out, they each carry a two-foot-long wooden stick, rampage through the countryside, ignore the law, and openly regard themselves as rulers. Human ethics in the bandit area have been completely destroyed. In Hebei Village, Xianghe County, a female member once beat her father-in-law to death with a wooden stick and then beat her aunt to death. No one in the village dared to interfere. The refugee said: If the National Army does not recover the area, he would rather starve to death in a foreign land than return home. He does not want to return to his hometown and suffer the cruel crimes of the Communist bandits.</p>

<h3>Another Upheaval at the China College in Beiping - Students Expel the Secretary-General and the Chief of General Affairs</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping 24th Dispatch] The private China College in Beiping has experienced another incident. The college has been struggling to become nationalized for years. After the expulsion of Principal He Qi, a school affairs committee was organized, led by Secretary-General Chao Qingchang and Chief of General Affairs Han Daozhi. However, Tan and Han, who led the expulsion of He last time, were suddenly expelled. The Student Union of the China College held a general student meeting last night and announced several crimes of Han Daozhi. Han deposited 1 billion yuan of school funds in a bank and took 40% of the black interest. He also bought gold houses with public funds. When Han exchanged the flour allocated to students by UNRRA, he took 30,000 yuan per bag. Secretary-General Chao Qingchang nominally led the nationalization effort but secretly controlled the school. Professors left one after another due to low salaries. The certificates issued by the acting principal were not valid for applying to judicial organs. The tuition fee was originally set at 200,000 yuan but was suddenly changed to 280,000 yuan. Students who paid late for ten days would be expelled. He also intended to refuse Wang Zhengting as the new principal and privately formed a board of directors (Kong Xiangxi formed the board in Shanghai and the Ministry of Education approved). The School Protection Committee held a reception for reporters at 3:00 PM this afternoon. In addition to restating the above points, they also said that they had prevented Han Daozhi from coming to the school and forced Chao Qingchang to move out of the school with his family immediately.

<h3>A Discussion of the Provincial Government Reform Plan</h3>
<p>— Chu Zirun</p>
<p>Everyone knows the shortcomings of the current provincial administration. Reforming it has become a consistent demand from above and below. The Ministry of Interior's timely submission of the provincial administration reform plan to the Executive Yuan is worthy of our attention. Reviewing the common malpractices of past provincial administrations, there are roughly three: First, the legal status of the province is not defined; second, the organization of the provincial government is complex and its operations are inflexible; and third, provincial finances lack long-term planning and have a weak foundation. Therefore, reforming the provincial administration has become the most pressing issue.</p>
<p>Today, when speaking of provincial administration reform, in my opinion, there are two principles that must be followed: First, prepare for the implementation of constitutional government to lay the foundation for provincial autonomy. Second, implement the "three-linked system" of administration to improve administrative efficiency.</p>
<p>First, prepare for the implementation of constitutional government to lay the foundation for provincial autonomy. The Constitution of the Republic of China, passed by the National Assembly and promulgated by the National Government, has determined the nature of the province in the future as a high-level local self-governing body. Therefore, the key task at hand is how to transform a province that is a central representative body into a province that is locally self-governing. This should not be addressed only after the implementation of the Constitution. During this period, any provincial measures that run counter to the principles of provincial autonomy stipulated in the Constitution must be stopped immediately. Any measures that can lay the foundation for provincial governance after the implementation of the Constitution should be adjusted and implemented early to prepare for the implementation of the Constitution. For example, dividing the administrative institutional systems of the central government and the provinces to respect the status of provincial self-governing bodies; increasing the powers and responsibilities of the provincial chairman to prepare for the implementation of the provincial governor system to achieve administrative unity; downsizing agencies, simplifying structures to concentrate strength, unifying powers, saving expenditures, and promoting government affairs. Relaxing the standards for reviewing provincial budgets and work plans, only requiring that they do not contradict national policies and laws, and do not change their content and direction, to gradually cultivate their self-governing ability, etc.</p>
<p>Second, implement the "three-linked system" of administration to improve administrative efficiency. The purpose of provincial administration reform is nothing more than to empower the people of the province and enable the provincial government. To make the provincial government an all-powerful government and improve administrative efficiency, it is necessary to implement the "three-linked system" of administration. All the principles of the "three-linked system" of administration, such as implementing the system of secretary-general, the system of layered responsibility, the system of graded responsibility, planned politics, and planned economy, must be thoroughly reformed with reference to the guidelines to achieve realization.</p>
<p>The provincial administration reform plan submitted by the Ministry of Interior to the Executive Yuan for review this time (published in the Nanjing Central Daily on August 8) is an important document for reforming local politics. Its contents are divided into five items: dividing systems, defining powers and responsibilities, simplifying institutions, managing personnel, and improving government affairs, all of which are very concise and hit the mark. The symposiums of the provincial chairmen also provided valuable opinions, demonstrating the importance attached by each province. The author has served in provincial administration for more than ten years and would also like to offer a few words based on what I have seen in ordinary times for the consideration of experts.</p>
<p>(A) Dividing Systems. The original plan of the Ministry of Interior stipulates that the central ministries and agencies should address the provincial government when issuing government orders and executing the affairs under their jurisdiction. Except for legal procedures (such as the Director of the Civil Affairs Department being the election supervisor), each ministry is not allowed to correspond directly with departments under the province. This provision was originally intended to respect the provincial government's authority and implement a graded responsibility system, so that government orders can be consistent, and responsibilities can be concentrated, so that the provincial chairman can oversee provincial administration, and the departments can be under the command and control of the provincial chairman, so that there will be no disadvantages as in the past, where each department and the central supervising ministry had their own affiliations and systems of authority, and it was difficult to get rid of the problem of a tail wagging the dog. However, if it is strictly stipulated that each department is not allowed to correspond directly with the central supervising ministry, such as the Ministry of Education not being able to correspond with the Provincial Department of Education, and the Department of Education not being able to correspond directly with the County Bureau of Education, then why is the County Education Section changed to a bureau, and why does the Provincial Government set up departments? If the should be placed in the provincial government, equivalent to the sections of each ministry and the departments of each county government, as internal of the provincial government, and not as independent institutions, is this kind of reform appropriate in today's society where affairs are progressing and government affairs are changing rapidly? Therefore, it is difficult to agree with the rigid stipulation that direct correspondence is not allowed. In fact, purely administrative affairs should be carried out by the order of the Executive Yuan, with the deputy minister of the supervising minister countersigning, or by the supervising ministry addressing the provincial government with a letter, in order to centralize authority. However, matters under the jurisdiction of each ministry, which are purely guidance on methods and techniques, may still be directly corresponded with for convenience. In this way, the graded responsibility system can be implemented, and in addition to the concentration of power, the effect of unobstructed communication and flexible application can be achieved.</p>
<p>(B) Defining Powers and Responsibilities. In accordance with the principle of in the "three-linked system," they should be specified in detail by enumeration so that each department knows its responsibilities. The content is that the chairman of the provincial government exercises his functions and powers on behalf of the provincial government, and each head of department should be subject to his control, in preparation for the future implementation of the provincial governor system. The enumerated points are roughly the same as the "General Rules for Responsible Offices of the Provincial Government" formulated by each province in accordance with the "Principles and Procedures for Each Agency to Exercise Responsibilities" previously promulgated by the Executive Yuan. If they can be implemented as required by law, they will be able to stand at their posts, each bear their own responsibility, cultivate the spirit of automatic independence, establish a model for the democratization of agencies, and lay the foundation for the implementation of government. This is its advantage. However, there is one imperfection: although the period for implementing constitutional government is near, the time for implementing the popular election of provincial governors is still to be determined. During this transition period, the provincial chairman will preside over provincial administration for a considerable period of time, and there should be concrete regulations on the selection criteria for the provincial chairman. "If there is a person, there is governance; if the person is gone, the governance ceases." Whether the provincial chairman is a good person or not is greatly related to the rise and fall of the politics of a province. "Separation of military and civilian affairs" is a consistent call from above and below, and it is easy for the military to hold political power, which may form a situation of separatism. Local areas should have military power, which should become a thing of the past. After ten years of hard struggle in the National Revolution, the situation of local separatism has been tending to disappear. Through the efforts of the military, the military must be nationalized. The responsibility for local pacification should be borne by the national army, and there is no need for the military to serve as chairman at the same time. This is not only the claim of the people of the country, but also the suggestion of General Wedemeyer's special envoy during his visit to China. However, the military account for more than 90% of the current provincial chairmen, and most of them are active officers. The fact that the words "separation of military and civilian affairs" are not mentioned in this reform plan seems to be its biggest shortcoming.</p>
<p>(C) Simplifying Institutions. The original proposal stipulates that the existing institutions should be considered and merged in accordance with the "Revised Provincial Government Organization Law" and the "Provisional Regulations on Joint Office of the Provincial Government" and in light of actual needs. The administrative affairs should be classified and merged into the various departments that should be established according to their nature. The management of the institutions should be changed to the departments that should be in charge. This method is very appropriate in principle to simplify institutions and concentrate power. However, there are two points that should be added to the full text: (1) The institutions originally stipulated for downsizing only refer to the provincial institutions. In my opinion, all institutions established by the central government in the province, whose responsibilities overlap with the functions and powers of the provincial government's departments (such as various tax collection agencies that can be merged into the provincial government's Department of Finance, which are more clearly distinguished), should also be downsized into each department together with their funding. Second, how to downsize institutions cannot be delegated to the province. The province should formulate measures and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. The establishment of provincial institutions is based on laws and regulations, and the provincial government is not suitable for making claims based on its own preferences. Only after the central government decides, it will be implemented by the order of the Executive Yuan. My specific downsizing opinion is that the provincial government should set up four departments: Secretariat, Accounting, Security, and Social Affairs, and four bureaus: Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, and Construction. All other provincial-level administrative institutions should be downsized, and all service institutions should be transformed. The military district headquarters and security headquarters must be parallel to the provincial government; because the Ministry of National Defense is subordinate to the Executive Yuan, the two headquarters can also be subordinate to the provincial government and merged into the Provincial Security Police Department. As for the institutions that each province has established on its own, they should all be downsized, which goes without saying.</p>
<p>(D) Managing Personnel. According to the current "Provincial Government Organization Law," the provincial government chairman concurrently serves as one of the members of the provincial government, and the , such as those of the heads of the Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, and Construction , are concurrently held by the members, which is no different. All of them are appointed by the National Government after being passed by the Council of the Executive Yuan. But in fact, members concurrently serve as heads of , mostly by of the provincial chairman, which has invisibly become a chief officer system. The provincial administration reform is led by the provincial chairman and is responsible to the Executive Yuan, so this power of appointment seems reasonable. But this reform plan stipulates: "The appointment of each shall be formulated by the central government, registration procedures will be established, and qualified candidates will be reserved in advance by each ministry (the Accounting Officer will be handled by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics). When there is a vacancy, the supervising department will submit two to three people to the Executive Yuan meeting for decision and appointment. Except for the Secretary-General, the provincial government chairman will not be allowed to stay or leave," which aroused the opposition of the provincial chairmen's symposium. But the author agrees with the opinion of the Ministry of Interior that in the future, when constitutional government is implemented, the provincial governor system will be adopted, and the provincial governor will be elected by the people with a fixed term, and there will be no members. The and service institutions below, whether it is the Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, and Construction or the Secretariat, Accounting, Security, and Social Affairs , should all be civil servants; civil servants should not be affected by political turmoil, and should not advance or retreat with the . Therefore, it is appropriate for the central supervising ministry to select specialists and submit them to the Executive Yuan meeting for approval and appointment in order to maintain an all-powerful government. This claim of the Ministry of Interior is not excessive and I express my support. However, the provincial chairman and the future provincial governors should retain the right to impeach the heads of each department with the central government in order to remedy the of no command.</p>
<p>(E) Improving Government Affairs. The original proposal of the Ministry of Interior is divided into five points: (1) The business of the central government in the province should be entrusted to the province in principle; (2) If the work plan does not contradict national policies and laws, the central government should review it without changing its content in principle; (3) Simplify official document procedures; (4) Stipulate that the business expenses should not be too small; (5) Organize and regulations, etc., are all very concise. In the past, the central ministries and agencies often reviewed the work of the provinces too strictly, which showed disrespect for the opinions of the provinces and went against the principle of provincial autonomy. Therefore, it could not be approved in time, and sometimes the province's 36-year plan had not been approved by July of the 26th year, so the plan was equivalent to . In addition, under the office system, the handling of documents is particularly slow. According to Mr. Nai Guang's investigation, a document enters the provincial government and goes through 18 procedures from registration to delivery to the person in charge, and 17 procedures from the person in charge's draft to the chairman's judgment (see The New Theory of Chinese Administration by). It is very necessary to simplify documents.</p>
<p>However, in addition to these five improvements, the author has several supplementary items:</p>
<p>(1) The provincial budget must be approved early. The annual budgets of the provinces are often approved by the central government at the end of the year because it takes time for the central government to seriously review them, so the budget cannot be implemented according to the budget; the work plan must be based on the budget, and the plan cannot be implemented without the budget. Provincial administration is in a state of without a budget or a plan, so how can it be expected to be on the right track? The provincial budget should be divided into two types in the future: one is the budget for entrusted matters, that is, the expenses for implementing matters entrusted by the central government, which should be by the entrusting central agency and be part of the national budget; the other is the budget for autonomous matters, that is, the expenses for handling provincial local autonomous affairs and supervising counties' handling of autonomous affairs, which should be from the province's autonomous tax revenue. Since the budget has been reviewed and approved by its civil , the central of the supervisory agency must be picky, as long as it does not contradict laws and policies, it should be approved before the start of the year. As for how to collect and how to spend, it is all the matter of the autonomous body itself, so in the reform plan, it should be clearly stipulated that the provincial budget must be approved before the start of the year.</p>
<p>The financial rights of autonomous bodies must be respected. The current provincial finances are difficult to , but the central government's lack of respect for the financial rights of the provinces is the main reason. In terms of revenue, it is necessary to seek an appropriate division of tax rights, and in terms of expenditure, it is necessary to strive for savings. The central orders to the provinces are for more than autonomous , but most of the entrusted do not have , and the central must shoulder burden. If the are all by the superior commissioning agency , and the autonomous revenue is all used for autonomous , respecting the autonomous , then the finances of each province will not be as difficult as they are now. Moreover, taking from the people and using it for the people, taking is not and can naturally move towards self-sufficiency, solving the current provincial financial .</p>
<p>(3) The central government's entrusted matters should be limited. The businesses that the central government operates in the province should not set up separate institutions, but should be entrusted to the provincial government to handle them in principle, but they cannot be entrusted in everything without limit. Purely national affairs that should not be entrusted to the provinces should not be entrusted so that provinces can focus on the of the provincial autonomous and the of county autonomy, so that they will not be tired of. As for which can be entrusted and which should be handled by themselves, the provisions of Articles 107 to 110 of the Constitution should be used as .</p>
<p>If the authorities adopt the above opinions and supplement and amend them when reviewing the draft of the provincial administration reform plan of the Ministry of Interior, I believe it will be of some .</p>

<h3>Failure of Foreign Minister of Greece to Form a Cabinet Due to Refusal of Cooperation from the Liberal Party; The United States Takes a Watching Attitude Towards the Greek Political Turmoil</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] London, 24th Broadcasting: The Foreign Minister of Greece, Tsaldaris's today to form a new cabinet has failed. The leader of the Liberal Party, Sophoulis, has refused to join the . The Foreign Minister met with Sophoulis today for an hour, but no result was achieved.</p>
<p>[Reuters Athens, 24th] The King of Greece, Paul, authorized the leader of the People's Party, Tsaldaris, last night to form a new cabinet. Tsaldaris is expected to submit a list of the new cabinet on Monday, and the parliament has also scheduled a meeting on Thursday to listen to the new cabinet's policy guidelines. After accepting the imperial order and leaving the palace yesterday, Tsaldaris said that he would invite all parties, including the Liberal Party, to participate in the new cabinet, and Tsaldaris will also ask the parliament to vote on the new cabinet on Thursday. (Tsaldaris as National)</p>
<p>[Reuters Athens, 23rd] The Greek cabinet resigned today due to internal division, and King Paul convened a meeting of party leaders today in an attempt to resolve the crisis. Among the internal affairs measures that the cabinet discussed yesterday was a proposal to declare the Communist Party illegal, but no resolution was reached. Today, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Liberal Party, Venizelos, the Minister of Interior of the Social Democratic Party, Papandreou, and the Minister of Aviation of the National Unity Party, Kanelopoulos, first announced their resignations, and the cabinet collapsed with them. The Greek cabinet now seems to be divided into two factions, one led by Foreign Minister Tsaldaris, and the other is the three-center party cabinet members who first resigned. Papandreou intends to get his hands on the position of Minister of the Army. American officials here are deeply concerned that if the right-wing People's Party comes to power, it will take radical and strong policies, making the country's weak resources subject to more tense extraction. Some observers expect that there are three possible ways to resolve the crisis: (1) Tsaldaris and his People's Party will form a right-wing government; (2) the People's Party and the Liberal Party will jointly form a "national salvation cabinet"; (3) a personalized government will be formed, with the most prestigious figures in the country, such as Archbishop Damaskinos or General Plastiras, taking the lead. A government led by the People's Party will take extremely repressive policies against the guerrillas, and a coalition government of the Liberal and People's Parties can be expected to take a middle-of-the-road policy and work with parliamentarians to resolve the domestic situation peacefully. However, the opinions of the leader of the Liberal Party, Sophoulis, who is 88 years old, and Tsaldaris, have always been regarded as irreconcilable. As for organizing a transitional personalized government to promulgate an amnesty in preparation for new elections, it is feared that it will be difficult to obtain the support of the parliament.</p>
<p>[United Press International Washington, 23rd] State Department officials informally stated that the fall of the Greek government is an opportunity to organize a more universal cabinet, and the United States does not intend to directly interfere in the reorganization of the new government.</p>
<h3>US Condemns Soviet Satellite States for Supporting Greek Guerrilla Warfare</h3>
<p>[United Press International Washington, 24th] The United States has recently accused the three Soviet satellite states, Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia, of acts of aggression against Greece, and accused the Soviet Union of hindering the Security Council's efforts to prevent aggression. The United States has reiterated its demand for "international action to maintain peace in the Balkans." The United States has specifically condemned the three countries of Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia for actively supporting guerrilla warfare within Greece amid the resurgence of recent border crossing operations on the Greek border, and said that the three countries have "blatantly and openly refused" to cooperate with the United Nations Investigation Team. The US State Department also issued two reports, describing the investigation by the UN battlefield team in northern Greece on May 20, to support its accusations. The report claimed that the team's work was greatly hampered by the three countries' obstructive tactics. When referring to the Soviet Union, the State Department said, "The Security Council was unable to effectively prevent the aggression of Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia against Greece due to the Soviet Union's use of its veto power twice on July 29 and August 19." Acting Secretary of State Lovett explained that the US submitted the case to the next UN General Assembly in order to avoid the Soviet Union's use of its veto power in the Security Council.</p>

The official declined to clarify the UK's response, but informed sources expressed doubts as to whether the UK would be able to comply with the request in the near future, as the British Consul General in Batavia, Mitchison, is about to step down, and the new Consul General, Shepherd, will not be able to take office until the beginning of September. At the same time, the British government is paying close attention to the possibility of a renewed outbreak of widespread war in Indonesia.</p>

<h3>Informal Agreement Reached Between Britain and the U.S. on Amending Article 9 of the Loan Agreement; Fiscal Conference Comes to an End</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 23rd Dispatch] The head of the British financial delegation, Sir Wilfrid Eady, has reached an informal agreement with U.S. officials on amending Article 9 of the Anglo-American Loan Agreement, which prohibits discrimination. This is the second major result achieved in this round of talks, following the agreement to suspend convertibility under Article 8 of the Loan Agreement concerning the acceptance of the pound sterling.</p>
<p>The Anglo-American financial conference has now come to an end, and Sir Wilfrid Eady and the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, Cobbold, are scheduled to leave the U.S. tomorrow to return to London to report on the progress of the conference and discuss policies to be adopted based on the agreement. Article 9 of the Anglo-American Loan Agreement restricts Britain from purchasing goods from the Sterling Area to prevent discrimination against imports from the Dollar Area. The agreement reached by both parties is essentially informal and requires technical discussion to formally amend the provisions of the loan agreement without having to go through the U.S. Congress. The result could enable Britain to further reduce purchases from the U.S. and switch to purchasing similar goods from the British Empire and the Sterling Area. After returning to London, Sir Wilfrid Eady will meet with key cabinet members to formulate a plan for balancing Britain's international payments, in preparation for the resumption of discussions by senior officials from both countries.</p>
<p>[United Press Agency, Washington, 23rd Dispatch] The British government may, within two months, request the United States to continue amending the $3.75 billion loan agreement.

<h3>Italy Leans Towards Western European Bloc; Soviet Rejection of Italy's UN Membership Seen as Unfriendly; Communist Power in Decline</h3>
<p>[United Press Agency, Rome, 23rd Dispatch] Since the Soviet Union rejected Italy's participation in the United Nations, and the Italian government has been able to implement a stable economic policy in domestic affairs in a timely manner, resulting in increased government credibility and a decline in the power of the Italian Communist Party, political observers believe that neutralists and liberals generally consider the Soviet action to be "clearly unfriendly." Coupled with Italian Prime Minister de Gasperi's request for an additional $350 million in loans from the U.S., these two factors have caused Italy, which claims to be impartial, to lean towards the Western European bloc.</p>
<h3>Does the United Nations Need the Soviet Union?</h3>
<p>— Special Translation by This Newspaper's Translation Department</p>
<p>Recently, people have often talked about this question: If the Soviet Union, one of the five powers, does not obstruct from the sidelines, will the United Nations be successful? This situation may continue to evolve, and is there a remedy? This question is gradually becoming urgent and attracting people's attention. The purpose of this article is to provide a simple analysis of this question.</p>
<p>Two Paths to Take</p>
<p>People who are most disappointed with the United Nations often say: We have no way to cooperate with the Soviet Union, nor do we have a way to remove it. They cite the Soviet Union's past actions and its uniform veto power. However, if the Soviet Union obstructs all efforts of the United Nations, and the other member states want to continue to pursue the two goals of the United Nations—security and progress—there are only two paths to take:</p>
<p>First, non-Soviet member states can fully exploit the capabilities of the United Nations that the Soviet Union cannot interfere with. Secondly, if this path does not work, they can collectively withdraw from the United Nations and establish a similar organization without allowing the Soviet Union to join.</p>
<p>The First Path The first path—that is, exploiting the functions of the current United Nations organization regardless of Soviet opposition—requires understanding the organization's goals, strengths, and limitations. Everyone knows that the goals of the United Nations are world peace, security, and progress, but few people know its strengths and limitations. Those familiar with the United Nations Charter acknowledge that the United Nations can only maintain peace and security with the cooperation of major powers. The United Nations is not an organization that inherently has the power to promote peace; it cannot suppress the five powers with veto power, and even without veto power, it cannot overwhelm the United States or the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Soviet Union's strategy of obstructing from the sidelines has not really taken away the United Nations' ability to maintain peace, because this ability has never existed. The Soviet Union's opposition only hinders international cooperation that could promote world peace.</p>
<p>In theory, the Soviet Union's ability to obstruct the United Nations is limited to the handling of major issues in the Security Council, where it has veto power. As for the United Nations General Assembly, the International Court of Justice, the Trusteeship Council, the Economic and Social Council, or subordinate agencies, the Soviet Union does not have veto power. In practice, although the Soviet Union can delay or hinder the discussion process of the aforementioned agencies, it ultimately cannot prevent the majority of member states from deciding on the final steps.</p>
<p>Therefore, on the surface, in many situations, if the majority of member states adopt a firm stance, limit and accelerate the progress of discussions, they may be able to overcome the Soviet Union's policy of procrastination. In such situations, neither abstentions nor veto power are effective, and if the United Nations is determined, it can perform its duties regardless of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>But what can be done within the scope of the executive actions of the Security Council, which has veto power, regardless of Soviet opposition?</p>
<p>The United Nations Charter provides for "regional arrangements" to deal with security issues suitable for regional action and recognizes the right of member states to individual or collective self-defense in the event of armed attack before the Security Council takes action. Regarding the two terms "regional" and "arrangements," there are no restrictions other than the requirement that they must comply with the principles of the United Nations, and no approval from the Security Council is required.</p>
<p>However, "regional" executive actions, except in cases of compliance with "armed attack," must be approved by the Security Council. In such situations, "regional" defense measures can be taken before the Security Council takes the necessary steps to maintain peace.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the state of continued non-cooperation by the Soviet Union, it seems feasible for member states outside the Soviet bloc to organize a "regional organization" to achieve the security measures that the United Nations can obtain, and if necessary, use the veto power to prevent interference from the Security Council.</p>
<p>If non-Soviet countries join, if they guarantee that all resources are used for collective defense, and if they agree to treat evidence of planned aggression as "armed attack," then such a "regional" arrangement can achieve maximum effectiveness.</p>
<p>The Second Path</p>
<p>If the Soviet Union continues to obstruct the work or development of the United Nations, then the second path can be taken, which is: non-Soviet countries collectively withdraw from the United Nations and establish a new organization, and unless Soviet countries are willing to cooperate, they will not be allowed to join.</p>
<p>Advantages and Disadvantages</p>
<p>Assuming that the new organization, like the regional arrangement, has the same countries and provides the same resources, in terms of security, this plan has several advantages: First, it is not limited to defense against "armed attack"; second, it does not need to use the veto power to transfer the important tasks of the Security Council to regional groups; third, it has all the advantages of an organization composed of non-Soviet countries with righteous goals, whose purpose is to deal with their own problems and prevent aggression by the Soviet bloc.</p>
<p>For the United Nations' tasks and activities that the Soviet Union can only delay but not prevent, the new organization can act more quickly and effectively. The new charter can improve on the old one. But on the other hand, many activities, such as the activities of the United Nations General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council, and the International Court of Justice, are valuable precisely because of their universality. This disadvantage somewhat offsets the advantages of greater effectiveness.</p>
<p>Careful Consideration Required</p>
<p>However, before non-Soviet countries consider collectively withdrawing from the United Nations, there are several factors that must be considered. The United Nations organization is the largest and most extensive effort of mankind to abolish war and promote a secure and progressive world. If nearly forty countries withdraw from the United Nations at the same time, it is tantamount to admitting that this effort has failed, and they are unwilling to easily bear this responsibility until the last step.

<h3>First-Run Cinema Labor Strike: Agreement Reached to Resume Work Last Night; 60,000 Million Yuan Lost in One Day; Expected to Resume Screenings Today</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] All 15 first-run cinemas in the city were closed yesterday due to a strike by members of the Second Branch of the Cinema Industry Workers' Union. The second, third, and fourth-run cinemas were not affected and continued to operate as usual, but a few workers had a "lazy work" phenomenon. The Social Bureau convened labor and management all day yesterday to mediate, and an agreement was reached at 7:00 p.m. It was originally scheduled to resume screenings with the 9:15 p.m. show, but it was unable to be screened due to a temporary lack of notification. If there are no changes this morning, all first-run cinemas are expected to fully resume screenings this afternoon.</p>
<p>According to estimates from relevant parties, the city government's entertainment tax revenue lost 100 million yuan due to the strike of workers in the first-run cinemas, while the cinemas lost more than 500 million yuan.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu and Director Wu of the Social Bureau were furious when they learned of the strike of workers in various first-run cinemas the night before, believing that causing such a serious situation due to a dispute at the Majestic Cinema was a violation of the General Mobilization Order and affected social order. In addition to ordering the Labor Division of the Social Bureau to mediate in accordance with the law, he also ordered that cinema workers be immediately informed to resume work.</p>
<p>Cinema Industry Association's Four Demands</p>
<p>The Cinema Industry Business Association held an emergency meeting at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to discuss countermeasures. During the meeting, Chairman Liang Qitian stated that he was very sorry that the dispute at his Majestic Cinema had affected other cinemas. He immediately offered his resignation. The association continued its meeting at 3:00 p.m. and resolved four items: (1) The workers should unconditionally resume work before the Social Bureau conducts a trial mediation. (2) According to the Trade Union Law, the trade union cannot force employers to hire workers introduced by it. The responsibility for this labor unrest lies with the labor side. The cinemas were forced to close. Therefore, they demand to retain the right to claim damages for the losses suffered by the various cinemas due to the illegal employment of workers by the Second Branch of the Cinema Industry Workers' Union. (3) They demand that the authorities severely punish those who instigated this labor unrest. (4) Wages for the period of the workers' strike will be deducted across the board.</p>
<h3>Workers Patiently Await Mediation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, many workers from the various Paramount Pictures theaters gathered at the second branch of the labor union, patiently awaiting mediation by the Bureau of Social Affairs. The union demanded adherence to the previously established written record, stating that "when hiring additional staff, priority should be given to hiring unemployed members registered with the union." They believed that the Majestic Theater should dismiss the three female ushers it had hired who were not union members. The management, however, argued that most unemployed members had been dismissed by the management for misconduct. The three female ticket takers hired by the Majestic were introduced by the theater's board of directors, who had the right to advise on the theater's personnel matters.</p>
<h3>Three Ticket Takers Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>Shen Ding, Director of the Labor Department of the Bureau of Social Affairs, along with Fan Zhenbang, Chief of the Mediation Section, Gu Ruofeng, Deputy Chief, and Zhu Guilin, spent the entire day at the bureau yesterday to mediate this dispute. Shui Xiangyun and Fang Rusheng from the General Labor Union, and Huang Zuoxin and Qian Dayou from the Criminal Division of the Police Bureau also assisted in the mediation. Mayor Wu telephoned Director Shen twice in the morning, urging a swift resolution. After Director Shen and others summoned representatives from both labor and management for mediation, the workers agreed to resume work first by 4:30 PM. However, the management, feeling unprotected, refused to resume business. By 7:00 PM, it was finally agreed that the three female ticket takers hired by the Majestic Theater would be temporarily suspended, pending legal handling by the Bureau of Social Affairs. Regarding the labor's claim that the management had breached the contract and the management's denial of any breach, the Bureau of Social Affairs would convene a mediation based on the written record and facts to make a decision. The workers resumed work at 9:15 PM that evening, but the screening could not proceed because the projectionist and senior theater staff had not been notified in advance. That night, the Bureau of Social Affairs instructed the labor union to order all theater workers to unconditionally resume work first, and also instructed the trade association to notify the three female ticket takers hired by the Majestic Theater to temporarily suspend their services and await mediation. Director Shen and others immediately telegraphed Mayor Wu and Director Wu the progress of the mediation that night.</p>
<h3>Disagreement Unresolved</h3>
<p>However, according to the trade association late last night, in order to ensure practical protection in the future, the cinema industry put forward four demands, one of which was the unconditional resumption of work by the workers. The association noted that the Bureau of Social Affairs' notification to the three ticket takers at the Majestic Theater to suspend their services still constituted a "conditional" arrangement. The association argued that the qualifications and abilities of the three ticket takers were all appropriate, and they had not violated any laws. Therefore, the authorities had no reason to instruct the theater to notify them to suspend their services.</p>
<h3>Rumors of a "Kidney Harvesters Gang" Spark Panic, Leading to a Fatal Incident on the Suzhou Creek: Boatmen Beaten to Death, Two Injured; Seventeen Suspects Arrested and Investigated</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Recently, bizarre rumors have suddenly spread throughout the city, claiming the emergence of "child-snatching gangs" and "kidney harvesting gangs." Ignorant citizens widely believe these rumors, causing widespread panic and significantly affecting public order. Several days ago, in Yangsi Township in Pudong and near Gaochang Temple in the Nanshi area, the aforementioned rumors led to two tragic incidents of women being mistakenly attacked, resulting in one death and one injury. Yesterday morning, a similar tragic incident occurred in the Suzhou Creek in the central district. Upon receiving the report, Wu Kexiao, the director of the responsible water police sub-bureau, and Song Bingzheng, the section chief, immediately led a large number of police officers to investigate. The investigation revealed that two sampan boatmen, a boat owner and his companion, had been beaten to death and injured, respectively. Seventeen ignorant boatmen were arrested at the scene for assault.</p>
<p>Wrongfully Beaten; Pleas for Help Unanswered</p>
<p>It is reported that before the incident, boatmen in the vicinity had heard rumors of three so-called "kidney harvesting gang" members passing by in a small boat, causing widespread panic. Around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, while it was still dark, boatman Zhou Changqing and his companion, "Little Fool," were traveling west to east along the river from Caojiadu in a sampan. Unfortunately, upon passing through the area, they were mistaken by nearby boatmen and stopped for questioning. Despite Zhou presenting his water district guarantee and city identification, the boatmen ignored them. As the two sides were arguing, someone suddenly shouted "Hit them!" The other boatmen, without hesitation, rushed forward and violently assaulted Zhou and his companion. Zhou and his companion cried for help, but no one answered.</p>
<p>Only Heard Rumors; Did Not Witness Anything</p>
<p>The responsible water police sub-bureau received a report and rushed to the scene, inquiring about the cause of the incident. They rescued Zhou and his companion. At that time, Zhou had lost consciousness and was rushed to Gongji Hospital for treatment, but "Little Fool" had already been beaten to death. The police arrested Chen Ruiting, Liu Ruigou, Xu Caiyou, Wu Youren, Cao Shanzhi, Chen Changgui, Ma Xuecheng, Yao Baoxing, Zhu Tingzai, Shi Xianglang, Sha Guanchen, Pu Qilin, Yang Qilang, Zhu Yonglin, Deng Fugen, Wei Fujin, and Li Defa, a total of seventeen people, and took them to the sub-bureau for investigation. According to the defendants' confessions, they had only heard rumors about the emergence of the "kidney harvesting gang" but had not witnessed anything themselves. When they heard someone shout "Hit them!", they acted impulsively and joined the assault, resulting in the tragic death. The water police sub-bureau is currently continuing a thorough investigation.</p>

<h3>Assistance Fund for Families of Martyred Journalists to be Distributed on September 1st, Journalist Day</h3>
<p>In celebration of September 1st, Journalist Day, and to commemorate journalists who died during the War of Resistance, this newspaper launched a fundraising campaign on the 20th of last month to "Raise Assistance Funds for the Families of Martyred Journalists in Shanghai" from all sectors of society. The "Home-Schooling Assistance Fund Board" and Wang Jinxian and others generously donated, allowing this campaign to proceed smoothly. The Shanghai Journalists Association believes that this initiative not only commends the martyrs and inspires future generations but also promotes justice for the nation and sets an example for all journalists. During a regular meeting on the 14th of this month, the Association decided to expand the scope, solicit more donations, and coordinate the campaign through the Association to achieve greater results. At that time, it was resolved to increase the fundraising target to 75 million yuan, with this newspaper and the *Xinwenbao* each contributing 20 million yuan, and the remaining amount raised separately by other newspapers. As September 1st, Journalist Day, is approaching, in accordance with the planned schedule, this assistance fund will be awarded on that day. The families of the martyrs are requested to submit a recent description of their family's living conditions to the Journalists Association at 149 Yuanmingyuan Road in this city after seeing this notice, in order to receive the assistance fund at that time.</p>

<h3>Pudong Seawall Project Can Be Completed Before the Autumn Floods</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Pudong Seawall starts from Wusong in the north and extends to Chuansha in the south, with the Gaogiao seaside bathing beach as the midpoint, divided into north and south sections. It was severely damaged during the War of Resistance. Since the Public Works Bureau actively began repairs, the South Seawall project has been restored, costing 1.5 billion yuan. On the North Seawall, the breaches have gradually widened due to the impact of wind and waves over the past year. A budget of approximately 4.1 billion yuan was prepared in April of this year, but the municipal treasury could not afford it. The municipal treasury first advanced 2.1 billion yuan to begin the project, dividing the Shenjiazai breach, Wujiazai breach, and Wujiawan breach into three sections. The second and third sections of the project are expected to be completed by the end of August. The first section, the Wujiazai breach project, is particularly difficult but is expected to be completed before the autumn floods. Furthermore, the full funding for the North Seawall project has been submitted by the Public Works Bureau to the National Water Conservancy Conference and approved, requesting the Executive Yuan to promptly allocate 4.1 billion yuan in assistance.</p>

<h3>A Near-Tragedy at the Penglai Market: Thugs Lurk, Preparing for a Showdown</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] At around 11:00 PM the night before last at the Southern Theater in the Penglai Market in the Nanshi area, a large number of traffic police from the Ministry of Communications clashed with theater staff. Fortunately, the headquarters of the Military Police was nearby, and a large contingent of military police rushed to suppress the situation. They took several traffic police and theater staff to the headquarters for mediation before letting them return. Fearing retaliation, the theater gathered five or sixty gangsters from the Guangdong Road and Mantingfang areas yesterday and stocked weapons such as knives and iron rods. They planned to ambush the traffic police who came in the evening and settle the score. Sun Hao, a staff member of the Penglai Police Station, learned of the plan and reported it to Director Yao of the branch bureau, who immediately ordered armed police officers to surround the theater. The gangsters fled in fear of punishment. Wang Zaiqing, Xie Yunfang, and staff members Zhou Yimin, Yang Deqing, Li Shanliang, and Si Changlin were arrested, and weapons such as broadswords, iron rods, and iron forks were found inside the theater. They were all taken to the station for investigation. It is reported that the theater lacks responsible personnel and will likely suspend performances today.</p>

<h3>Broadcast by Two Railway Bureau Directors, Chen Bozhuang, on "Overview of Passenger Transport in the Jinghu Area"; Peak Passenger Traffic Reached 3 Million People Per Day</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] This newspaper held its 21st Sunday special broadcast at the Amerlin Radio Station yesterday, inviting Chen Bozhuang, director of both the Jinpu and Huhang Railway Bureaus, to speak on "Overview of Passenger Transport in the Jinpu Area." A summary of his speech is recorded below:</p>
<p>The railways under the jurisdiction of the current Jinpu Area Railway Administration are the former Jinpu and Huhang railways, commonly referred to as the Two Lines. I believe that what society is most concerned about regarding the Two Lines is their passenger transport. We have not yet been able to resolve the congestion of passenger transport, which we deeply regret. The takeover of the Jinpu Area Railway began on October 1st of the year before last, and it has been 22 months, almost two years. During these two years, traffic on the Two Lines has never been interrupted. Although traffic accidents are inevitable and temporary line blockages occur, this is the case for any railway.</p>
<p>Need to Replenish Eighty Cars</p>
<p>At the time of the takeover, we only had 190 passenger cars. Now, we have increased that to 483. In terms of seating, the Jinpu Line had 10,000 seats at the time of the takeover, and now it has been increased to 32,000 seats. The Huhang Line had 4,000 seats at the time of the takeover, and now it has been increased to 13,000 seats. The combined number of seats on both lines is 45,000. However, according to our passenger transport situation, we need approximately 50,000 seats in total to relieve passenger transport congestion. This difference of 5,000 seats is the most important problem that we are actively trying to solve. Over the past two years, our method of increasing passenger cars has been to transform freight cars into passenger cars. At the same time, we have ordered some cars from the United States. These American cars are just old cars. After the war, all countries need to replenish their own railway cars, so no new cars can be exported within two years. Now, I only need to replenish eighty more cars to relieve passenger transport congestion. You may not know that the number of passengers on this line now has greatly increased compared to before the war. Before the war, the average daily passenger traffic on the Two Lines was only 1.4 million people, but since the recovery, the peak passenger traffic has reached over 3 million people, and the average is always around 2.3 to 2.4 million. The transportation task we are shouldering is indeed much greater than before the war!</p>
<p>Many Difficulties in Laying Double Tracks</p>
<p>The general perception of society is that the Jinpu Line should lay double tracks. It is true that the Jinpu Line, which connects the capital with Shanghai, the center of industry and commerce, is qualified to lay double tracks in the near future. But in terms of current needs, we do not need to make such extravagant demands. If double tracks can be laid between Wuxi and Shanghai, the transportation difficulties of the Jinpu Line will be completely resolved. Because the current highest traffic density is between Shanghai and Wuxi, reaching 40 times every 24 hours. Although it has not yet reached the saturation point for single-track traffic, it has already caused many difficulties in scheduling and the punctuality of trains. However, in terms of current financial resources, we do not dare to harbor such extravagant hopes. In addition to this, we hope to install a CTC electrical centralized control traffic system on the other hand. This is the most economical and effective way to increase the capacity of single-track traffic, allowing trains traveling in the same direction between two stations to follow each other, increasing from one train to two or three trains.</p>
<p>High-Speed Trains Require Huge Costs</p>
<p>You must remember the high-speed trains before the war, which could reach between Jinpu in five hours. Indeed, this is an urgent need of society. But to run high-speed trains, we must replace all 470,000 sleepers and all the steel rails. But sleepers and steel rails must come from abroad, which requires foreign exchange, and the amount of money required is really large. This depends on the government's decision and the assistance of friendly countries, whether this can be realized. Solely based on the railway bureau's own financial resources, such a huge investment is impossible.</p>
<h3>Special Broadcast Program</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Our newspaper held its twenty-first Sunday all-day special broadcast yesterday at the Amerland Radio Station. In addition to inviting the two Bureau Chiefs, Chen Bozhuang, to speak on "The General Situation of Passenger Transport on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway," the entire day's program is recorded below: Starting at 9:00 AM, Dr. Zhong Zhihe lectured on medicine, and Mr. Zhao Jingshen lectured on "How to Appreciate Kunqu Opera." Starting at 1:00 PM in the afternoon, the Lele Friendship Association performed songs, Miss Bao Hanying told children's stories, Shi Renwang led a harmonica ensemble, Lawyer Mi Xitong lectured on law, Dr. Wang Juerong lectured on "Several Common Infectious Diseases in Children," and Fan Fengyuan lectured on "What is Radio?" From 7:00 to 9:00 PM, members of the Jinglun Quzhuang Society of Kunshan were specially invited to broadcast and sing five excerpts of Kunqu opera, including Chen Zhaobang and Yu Hanping's *Linked Plots* (Questioning and Reconnaissance), Lu Zhengwen's *West Chamber* (Playing with the Letter), Lu Jingmin's *Treasure Sword* (Night Flight), Pan Shaoyi, Tao Bohe, Hu Kun, and Chen Zhongfu's *Searching for Relatives* (Tea Visit), and Hu Jingan and Tao Bohe's *Shepherd's Tale* (Yearning for Home). Having Kunshan natives sing Kunqu opera is naturally different from others. From 9:00 to 12:00 PM, famous local amateur and professional Peking opera singers were specially invited to broadcast Peking opera, including Liang Xiaohong's *Daiyu Burying Flowers*, Li Pengfei's *Stealing the Horse*, Xiong Songquan's *Seven Star Lamp*, Miss Wu Husheng's *Life and Death Hate*, Miss Yuan Yun's *Phoenix Returns Home* (Complete Play), Wu Jiangfeng's *String of Pearls*, Chen Dezhen's *Sending the Son*, and finally, Chen Dahuo and Miss Jin Suqin's duet *Three Mothers Teaching the Son* (Complete Play). Both of them are highly regarded in the opera world. Their collaboration as *sheng* and *dan* for our newspaper's broadcast, with their exquisite artistry, gained much appreciation from the audience.

<h3>Wu Zhihui in Wuxi Discusses War and Conscription The United States Will Inevitably Increase Aid to China Striving to Improve Life in a Difficult Situation</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Wuxi on the 23rd] Mr. Wu Zhihui, a veteran of the Party and the country, came to Wuxi the day before yesterday to visit the families of Kang and Sun. At 6:00 PM last night, he hosted a banquet at the Yingchun Garden on Guanqian Street for local government officials and leaders from various fields. During the banquet, Elder Wu spoke extensively about General Wedemeyer's visit to China, the bandit warfare in the county, the future of China, and his views on elections, constitutionalism, and conscription, covering a wide range of topics, both past and present, with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Elder Wu said that since President Truman sent General Wedemeyer to China, the Chinese people have hoped that the United States will increase its aid to China as a result of his visit. He believes that this expectation is not incompatible with the situation, because some Americans believe that the current suppression of unrest in China is a civil war, and even many Chinese people mistakenly believe it to be a civil war. In fact, this war is by no means a struggle between Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong for personal gain. The government has always been tolerant of the Communist Party. The Communist Party has initiated all wars in various regions. If we continue to be tolerant, it would be tantamount to letting Mao Zedong rule the entire China. Therefore, this war is actually a war of political systems, not a struggle for power between individuals or factions. If the Chinese people welcome the Communist Party's rule, then this war is not only a civil war but also completely unnecessary. The United States is completely different from the Soviet Union in terms of ideology and political system. If China is ruled by the Communist Party, it would be very unfavorable to the United States. Now, the Americans do not want China to become a Communist-ruled world, but on the other hand, they consider China's suppression of unrest as a civil war, which is a great contradiction. As for the criticism that China's politics are corrupt and that corruption is rampant throughout the country, and that the United States does not provide convenience for American merchants in China in terms of trade, using this as a reason to oppose aid to China is no different from some people in the country who hope for peace on the one hand and are single-mindedly distressed by political corruption on the other. The prevalence of political corruption is caused by the war. If the war is not quelled, the government will have to devote all its efforts to dealing with the war, and it will not have time to take care of the cleanliness of the household. Mere criticism is greatly inappropriate for the Chinese people and is superficial for the Americans. The US authorities should weigh the pros and cons, and their views should be different from this. In short, even if China is a cat's paw, taking chestnuts out of the fire for the Americans, the claws must be slightly oiled and cleaned to avoid burning the claws in the fire before getting the chestnuts. This is a clear principle. Therefore, the United States will inevitably increase its aid to China in the future, even if there are some twists and turns.</p>
<p>Elder Wu then discussed the trend of suppressing the unrest and the time limit for ending the war and restoring peace, saying: Some people think that the strength of the National Army is gradually weakening, which is absolutely not true. As for the Communist Army appearing to have a stronger trend, it is at most only obtaining some fresh troops from the Soviet Union. However, the Americans should be aware that the Soviet Union is concentrating all its efforts and does not want to lightly expend its strength in the next ten years (at least five years). Therefore, the Third World War will definitely not break out in the next five to ten years, and the Communist Party will definitely not be able to obtain a large amount of foreign aid. The completion of the suppression of the unrest, if it is smooth and stable without unexpected incidents, has the possibility of coming to an end. However, war is most likely to cause unexpected changes, especially with complex international relations, which can cause even more changes. Therefore, the world will have to wait for the war to be quelled and after many years of consolidation before it can be peaceful.</p>
<h3>Qingdao's Flower Industry Donates 20 Million to Support the Troops and Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Qingdao on the 24th] The 202 households in Qingdao's flower industry, under the name of the Shuju Friendship Association, donated 21,620,000 yuan this morning to support the troops and provide relief to refugees and displaced students.</p>
<p>Elder Wu mentioned that Mr. Luce, the publisher of American magazines such as "Life," "Fortune," and "Time," once wrote that China currently has four major problems: (1) too many illiterates, (2) corruption, (3) decadence, and (4) hypocrisy, only knowing how to beautify the facade. However, these are not worth worrying about. In the Elizabethan era in England and the era of Louis XIV in France, these four problems were also rampant. Later, with the rise of industry and the change in social economy, these four problems were swept away. Among the countries in the world, only Japan is poor and clean, without rampant four problems. Other than that, they are all the same. Currently, China is living in a difficult situation between the two major powers, the United States and the Soviet Union, and it is naturally difficult to get rid of poverty. However, living in a difficult situation is better than being ruled by a single powerful force. The United States is now our friend, but if MacArthur is stationed in Peiping one day, then the American Skytroopers will often visit our heads. Otherwise, we can only live in a difficult situation and strive to improve as much as possible and work hard to produce. This is what we can do and should do.</p>
<p>Elder Wu said that he would not participate in the election this time. Regarding the conscription issue, he said that conscription is not a foreign concept. From the land tax, we can see that conscription was already in place in the past, but recruitment is not bad either. The people of Shandong and Henan provinces are happy to be soldiers, while the people of Jiangsu are not used to it. However, conscription has already been implemented during the current period of unrest.</p>
<p>Finally, Elder Wu discussed four things in the world: First, morality, which is the path that everyone should follow. Because everyone's position is different, their views on morality are also different. Second, economics, and third, politics, which should be regulated between morality and economics. Finally, there is desire, which often troubles mankind and is suppressed by the first three. If the environment is poor, then desires cannot be achieved, and morality and politics lose their power. Therefore, improving the economic environment is the most important thing, and the only way to improve it is through science. Mencius once said, "Those who ask for water and fire from their neighbors in the dark of night, making all things as cheap as water and fire, then there will be no unkind people in the world." Water and fire are produced by nature and are the cheapest. If we can use the power of science to make all things as cheap as water and fire, then the world will naturally be peaceful, morality will not matter, and politics will not be needed. Therefore, it is urgent to use the power of science to improve the environment.</p>
<h3>The Final Project of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Was Successfully Repaired and Tested Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Hangzhou on the 24th] The track-laying project between Hangzhou and Quzhou on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was completed a few days ago. The Dongjijiang Bridge, the final project, was also completely repaired and the test run was successful yesterday. It will be officially opened to traffic on September 1st.

<h3>Wuyuan Agricultural Loan Tea Fair to be Completed Next Month</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Wuyuan on the 21st] In recent years, the foreign tea industry has declined, and the rural economy relies heavily on the income from wood, paper, and tung oil. The Wuyuan agricultural loan to middle-class farmers includes tea, wood, tung oil, and paper, which are the objects of lending.</p>
<p>This year, the agricultural loan office stationed in Wuyuan first approved tea loans. The total amount of raw tea in the county this year is 8,000 dan. There are 34 tea merchants who received loans, with the largest loan being 1,000 dan, accounting for one-eighth of the total. The first phase of processing loans amounted to 1.36 billion yuan, and the second phase of transportation loans amounted to 420,000 yuan per dan. After deducting the 170,000 yuan for processing loans, the actual amount issued was 250,000 yuan. Based on the total amount of 8,000 dan of raw tea, the total amount was 2 billion yuan. These loans have been issued one after another in recent days.</p>
<p>As for loans for wood, paper, and tung oil, each merchant has not yet registered. The bank is encouraged by the government to export tung oil, and tung oil loans in the county should be held urgently. Wood and paper are related to inter-provincial trade, and support for their development should not be ignored. Once the tea loans are completed, the tung oil and paper loans will be continued. The tea loan period can be completed in September of this year. At this time, tung oil will be newly produced, and wood and paper will be in the peak sales season in winter. Taking advantage of the time to hold agricultural loans will benefit both the bank and the merchants. (Ning)</p>
<h3>The Minqiao Economic Construction Company Took Over the Fuzhou Public Bus Investment and Immediately Caused Disputes</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Fuzhou on the 20th] The Minqiao Economic Construction Company, which has been in preparation for more than a year, was established in Xiamen on July 12 this year. Dozens of overseas Chinese leaders from various ports in Southeast Asia attended, making it a grand occasion. It is understood that the company's future business policy will focus on developing mines in Fujian Province and smoothing traffic within and between provinces. The first investment target of the company is the Fuzhou Public Bus Company.</p>
<p>The public buses in and outside Fuzhou City were originally organized by the joint venture of the Fuxing and Fuxia bus companies. However, due to the shortage of funds, the company was not only unable to purchase new buses, but also had difficulty in replenishing ships and materials. Moreover, disputes between shareholders occurred from time to time, which greatly affected the business. Therefore, the company applied to the Construction Department for permission to send personnel to invite the Minqiao Economic Construction Company to cooperate in investment. Later, during the establishment of the Economic Construction Company in Xiamen, the Construction Department and the joint venture both sent representatives to Xiamen to negotiate with the Economic Construction Company several times. The company agreed and sent Vice Chairman Wang Zhenxiang and senior staff member Huang Chonghan to Fuzhou a dozen days ago to negotiate investment cooperation. The result of the agreement between the two parties was: Economic Construction invested 400 million yuan, together with the assets of the original joint venture of the Fuxia and Fuxing companies, plus the investment in the Fuxingquan Bus Company, which was valued at approximately 500 million yuan. This total of 900 million yuan was the total share capital of the new company, which was established as the "Jingjian Fuzhou Public Bus Company," with Ding Chaowu, Speaker of the Fujian Provincial Assembly, as Chairman and Huang Chonghan, representative of Jingjian, as General Manager. Unexpectedly, this reorganization caused dissatisfaction among some shareholders and employees. For example, shareholder Lin Deqiu and others hired lawyer Chen Linying to publish a protest, stating that this reorganization had not convened a shareholders' meeting to obtain the consent of all shareholders, which was a monopoly by a few people that infringed on the legitimate rights and interests of the majority of shareholders and would be sued according to law. The employees believed that the employee welfare issues had not been resolved and that the reorganization should not be carried out hastily. They also asked lawyers Chen Dengying and Hou Guangdi to publish a statement requesting that the Jingjian Company temporarily suspend the takeover. In addition, the shareholders were extremely dissatisfied with the candidates for directors and supervisors selected by the new company, and the employees also heard rumors that the personnel of the new company would be completely reorganized, and they all felt uneasy. A few days ago, slogans such as "Raise the political status of workers" and "Down with..." were found around the bus carriages in the city, which aroused great attention from the authorities and all sectors of society. If this matter is not properly resolved, the situation may escalate. Wang Zhenxiang, Vice Chairman of the Jingjian Company, told reporters that the company took over the Fuzhou public bus at the invitation of others and had no intention of monopolizing it. However, this matter is enough to illustrate the difficulty of overseas Chinese returning to invest in the country.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi-Guangxi Coal Mines Launch Exploration Work</h3>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency in Nanchang on the 24th] According to a survey by the Jiangxi Provincial Government, the coal in the Lingxia Coal Mine in Fengcheng is of good quality. The accumulated water in the mine is currently being pumped out. Preliminary investigations indicate that 300,000 metric tons of coal can be produced annually. If a convenient road of about 6 kilometers is built from the mining area to the Gan River, transportation will be even more convenient.</p>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency in Guilin on the 24th] According to investigations, the coal deposits in the Bose and Tianchang areas of western Guangxi are high-quality lignite from the Tertiary period. The thickest is 1 meter, and the thinnest is also several inches. The volatile matter accounts for 27% to 35%, so the combustion flame is very long, which is very suitable for industrial use. The Guangxi Provincial Government has specially dispatched a team to conduct a survey, which will depart within a week to prepare for large-scale mining.</p>

<h3>Grain Officials Embezzle Funds and Flee. How Can This Be Tolerated? The Authorities in He County Are Strictly Investigating</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Jiaxing on the 22nd] Recently, an incident occurred in the Tianliang Management Office of this county in which Chen Linchao, director of the Wangjiangjing Office, embezzled funds and fled. The reason is that Chen Linchao received seven pre-borrowed grain receipt books from the county management office two months ago and pre-collected them from the people. He did not report the amount that had been borrowed. This time, County Chief Hu Yunyi was transferred by the provincial government meeting last month, and his vacancy was filled by Pan Zhenqiu, the county chief of Chun'an County. In order to prepare for the handover, the county government began to send personnel to check the serial numbers and collect grain from the offices in various districts and verify the receipts issued. Chen Linchao, because the pre-borrowed funds had been lost and could not be compensated, initially made excuses to delay, saying that he would speed up the collection and end it. Then he said that the seven pre-borrowed receipt books had been stolen due to careless storage. He was about to submit a request for instructions. Now that the new county chief, Pan Zhenqiu, is scheduled to take office on the 21st of this month, the county government urgently needs to make a roster for handover, which is imminent. Chen Linchao had no choice and could not explain. He took advantage of the situation and destroyed all relevant documents, receipts, and stubs of the office on the 15th of this month and abandoned his post to flee. After receiving the report, the county government immediately sent personnel to Wangjiangjing to investigate. In addition to discovering a shortage of more than 60 shi of grain, other matters are still under thorough investigation and pursuit. The county government is currently publishing a public notice, soliciting the public to report as much as possible, and reporting to the province for handling.</p>

<h3>The Murdered Township Chief of Yizheng County Hangs on the Beam Yizheng Punishes the Murderers in the Dayan Township Bloodshed The Murderers and Main Instigators Are in Strict Custody</h3>
<p>Jin Shouzhu, the chief of Dayan Township in the Fourth District of Yizheng, was strangled to death at Jin's residence in Tumen on the evening of the 16th.

Many blood stains were found on Jin's shirt and on the door of his residence. The other murderers, Jin Shouyuan and Yang Yongjiang, are at large. The case was first interrogated at the police station on the evening of the 18th. Jin Yongshou refused to confess. Even though there were blood stains on his body, he still tried to quibble.

<p>Ningbo scoops up early rice leaving the region in large quantities</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Ningbo on the 22nd] Local gentry and township chiefs of this port believe that as the early rice in this county has just been harvested, merchants from Yao and Shao have been purchasing it one after another, and the number leaving the region is more than a thousand dan per day, and there is even more leaking to the sea, which has caused the price of grain to skyrocket. In one week, it has risen by as much as 100,000 yuan. The common people are all panicked, as evidenced by the proverb "Yong River cooks a bowl of porridge," which means that Ningbo's grain not only cannot feed itself but also needs to rely on foreign rice. How can we endure it?

<p>Shooting Skills Lacking, Xingdao Suffers First Defeat; Loses 2-5 to the Dulwich Team; Zhu Yongqiang and Cao Qiuting Each Score One Goal</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] Under the gaze of 14,000 spectators, the Xingdao team played their first match after arriving in England today against the Dulwich Hamlet team, a top-tier amateur football team in England. The Xingdao team performed well, especially in short passes, but their shooting skills were lacking. They even missed a penalty kick, and ultimately lost 2-5 to the Dulwich team. Ambassador Zheng Tianxi, the Secretary of the English Football Association, Mr. Russ, and Chinese naval cadets training in England also attended the match. The Xingdao team members all wore yellow and black striped jerseys, which were very beautiful. Although the performance was exciting, there were no surprises, so the famous Wan Jinsan was not used even once. After ninety seconds into the game, Dulwich team's Goff scored a goal. By the 18th minute, the British team had already scored three goals before Xingdao pulled one back. The first half ended with a score of 1-3. At the beginning of the second half, Xingdao scored another goal, making it 2-3, but the rest of the game belonged to the English, who scored two more goals, ending the game with a score of 5-2.</p>
<p>Beautiful Short Passes, Short Stature a Disadvantage</p>
<p>Observing this performance, the Xingdao team's skills, except for shooting, were comparable to those of the Dulwich team, especially their short passes, which were beautiful and sometimes left the opponent unable to cope. However, due to poor shooting, they ultimately lost. Most of the Xingdao players are around five feet five inches tall, so they were at a disadvantage when the ball was in the air. However, they all jumped up to head the ball, and sometimes were able to overpower taller opposing players. In terms of individual performance, the center back Jing Cheng was the most outstanding. Others who performed well included right back Hou Rongsheng and left winger Cao Qiuting. The two goals scored by Xingdao were made by left winger Zhu Yongqiang and Cao Qiuting. The English team's five goals were scored by Goff, Beglin, Davis, Cornett, and Jones respectively. It is noted that the average age of the Xingdao team members is over thirty, and the captain, Feng Jingxiang, is already forty-one years old. Given the heat, this performance is already quite remarkable.</p>
<p>Second Match Scheduled for the 28th</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 23rd] The Chinese Xingdao Football Team had an unfavorable start, losing their first match 2-5 to the Dulwich team. There were 15,000 spectators. The score in the first half was 3-1, with Dulwich taking the lead after Jones, the left forward, scored a goal within the first three minutes. Xingdao had three good opportunities, but failed to capitalize on them and tie the score. In the first half, the Dulwich team's Beglin and Davis each scored a goal, and Xingdao's left forward Zhu Yongqiang finally scored, which was a beautiful goal. At the beginning of the second half, Xingdao launched a major counterattack, and Cao Qiuting scored a goal amidst the chaos. Later, they had a good opportunity for a penalty kick, but missed it. The Dulwich team then scored two more goals, both by Jones. The audience's opinion was that the score did not fully reflect the strength of the visiting team, as the Chinese team could have scored at least three more goals if luck had been on their side.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 23rd] The Hong Kong Xingdao Football Team visited England and played its first match against the Dulwich Hamlet team today. The audience reached 14,000, and as a result, the Xingdao team lost 2-5. Zhu Yongqiang and Cao Qiuting each scored a goal. Xingdao's left inside forward, Li Zhaorong, did not play due to a right foot injury. Xingdao's next match is scheduled for the 28th of this month, against a team representing the English Football Association in Enfield.</p>

The goal scorers were Li Huitang, Li Shuoyou, Chen Dehui, and Li Deqi each with one goal, and Xie Jinhe with two goals. The university all-stars team lacked experience, leading to their defeat.</p>
<p>Panda and Fuxing Win in Softball League A Group</p>

<p>Tennis League: Sports Transport Wins Overwhelmingly, Lianghua Youlian Loses to Green Light; Jinlan Wins Over Lianmei 11-4</p>
<p>Yesterday was the third act of the tennis league. Sports Transport won overwhelmingly over Lianghua with a score of 15-0. The second group was the most intense and exciting. Xu Chengwei's serve and Zhu Kuan's tenacious left-handed play made the hard-hitting Bosky and Benavides struggle. In the first doubles match, Lianghua's Carson did not play, and was replaced by 17-year-old youths Zhu Xianyu and Xie Zhaoliang.

<p>The Issue of the Exchange Rate for Buying and Selling US Dollars; The Stabilization Board Is Studying It; The Four-Bank Loan Policy Can Be Determined Soon</p>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The President of the Central Bank, Zhang Jiawei, reported to the highest authorities last Wednesday on the situation of Shanghai's financial and commodity prices after the implementation of the revised foreign exchange settlement method, as well as the Sino-Hong Kong economic agreement and the list of candidates for the Import and Export Management Committee. During his stay in Nanjing, he also met with Special Envoy Wedemeyer to provide reference materials prepared by the Central Bank. He completed his official duties and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. According to reports, the issue of the exchange rate for buying and selling US dollars is currently being studied by the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, and will be implemented after being approved by the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting. As for the loan policy of the Four-Bank Joint Office to national banks, it is also being carefully studied by Xu Baiyuan, the Vice Minister of Finance and Secretary-General of the Four-Bank Joint Office, in consultation with all relevant parties, and a decision will be made soon.</p>
<p>Since the Implementation of the New Foreign Exchange Policy, Conditions in All Areas Have Been Good; Vice Minister Xu Hopes for Mutual Effort from the Industrial and Commercial Sectors</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 22nd] Vice Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan told our reporter on the 22nd that the situation has been good since the implementation of the new foreign exchange policy five days ago. This method was formulated based on social demands, so it is supported by most of the industrial and commercial sectors, and the response from abroad is also very good. The government is now working hard in all aspects to coordinate with the overall plan. It is hoped that the economy will be active after the implementation of this method, which opens a major door for our economy to embark on the road of self-reliance. However, whether we can move forward still depends on the joint efforts of the industrial and commercial sectors and the people to overcome difficulties, consider the economic conditions of the country and society, and work hard in many ways.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu also solemnly expressed the following three hopes to the national industrial and commercial sectors and the people: Regarding exporters, Mr. Xu believes that the new method is beneficial to exporters, and hopes that they will not repeat the mistakes of the past, competing to buy and sell, which would lead to unfavorable export phenomena. At the same time, he hopes that the quality and standards of export products can be maintained at the appropriate level.</p>
<p>Regarding industrial and mining manufacturers, after the change in foreign exchange, the cost of raw materials that need to be imported from abroad will increase. However, part of the products can be exported, which is sufficient to offset the increase. In addition, high wages and excessive management fees can hinder production. If these two cannot be reduced, then even if the price of raw materials is extremely low, production cannot be developed. He hopes that ways can be found to reduce them.</p>
<p>Finally, and most importantly, a spirit of social thrift should be cultivated. The government has formulated thrift measures, and it is hoped that the whole country can follow them. Otherwise, the cost of domestic reproduction cannot be accumulated. Regarding trade, it is easy to cause smuggling. If smuggling is not prevented, foreign exchange will be consumed as a result, and trade will also be affected. The government is paying close attention to the phenomenon of smuggling, and has agreed on cooperation measures with the Hong Kong government. After the exchange rate is changed, the phenomenon of smuggling can be reduced, but if the people cannot be thrifty, then the phenomenon of smuggling is difficult to eradicate. Therefore, eradicating smuggling should start with thrift.</p>
<p>When the reporter asked about the government's future loan policy, Mr. Xu replied that the government will handle this matter carefully. After the exchange rate was revised, some exporters, hoping for exports, rushed to buy exportable materials, which would inevitably raise the price of export products. The government will certainly be cautious about this type of loan. Furthermore, regarding loans to industrial and mining manufacturers, some industrialists and miners, after the revision of the foreign exchange rate, are willing to store more raw materials. This does not necessarily conform to the principle of balanced development, and does not necessarily coordinate with the entire plan. Therefore, the authorities are also very cautious about this type of loan.</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter asked about the foreign exchange income and expenditure situation, and whether a black market might occur. Mr. Xu replied: Generally speaking, the possible income of foreign exchange will be higher than ordinary estimates. Overseas Chinese have accumulated foreign exchange for some time and have not remitted it back. At this time, the foreign exchange rate is increased, and it is possible to remit back in batches those who have not remitted back before, which should be quite considerable. Some people worry that official exchange settlement of rice, cotton, and other items will affect foreign exchange reserves. Mr. Xu believes that this is not entirely true, because these daily necessities are produced domestically. Purchasing from abroad is only to supplement domestic shortages, and it will never be the case that valuable foreign exchange is used to purchase unlimited quantities, so it does not have any impact on the policy. The government will strictly prevent the possible occurrence of the foreign exchange black market, and hopes that it will not appear.</p>
<p>Young Appointed as Consultant to the National Bank</p>
<p>Financial expert, former financial advisor to the Chinese government, Dr. Arthur Young, arrived in Shanghai from the United States on August 22nd. Mr. Young has been away from China for nearly a year. This visit to China is at the invitation of President Zhang of the Central Bank, as a consultant to the bank, to assist in dealing with the stabilization fund and other current issues.</p>
<p>Chunmao Money Shop Opens Board of Directors Meeting, Chen Quanshi Elected Chairman</p>
<p>Liu Ximen, the former chairman of the Chunmao Money Shop on East Zhongzheng Road in Shanghai, resigned due to illness. The board of directors and supervisors of the shop held a joint meeting at 4 p.m. on the 20th of this month and resolved to approve the resignation. Director Chen Quanshi was publicly recommended as the chairman. It is noted that Mr. Chen is the father of Central Committee member Guo Fuli, and has a high reputation in the financial community. It is believed that the leadership of the shop will be in good hands in the future, and will contribute more to social finance.</p>
<p>Our New Foreign Exchange Policy Helps Carpet Exports to the United States</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 24th] According to the Commercial Daily, American importers of Chinese carpets believe that the general reaction to the Chinese government's new foreign exchange policy is that, after the basic economic situation in China is changed, the new policy will not stimulate the import of Chinese carpets into the United States. The most important factor in restoring Chinese carpet imports into the United States is whether the domestic economy in China itself can be improved, rather than the open foreign exchange market. The uncertainty in the price of raw materials, the estimation of production, and the unstable labor costs in China have caused Sino-American carpet manufacturers in the Tianjin and Beijing areas to regard production as overly risky. In addition, the decline in US demand for Chinese carpets is also one of the reasons why it cannot stimulate Chinese carpet imports into the United States. However, from a long-term perspective, the new foreign exchange policy does have magical effects for Chinese carpet exporters. In any case, American importers believe that the situation of opening Sino-American trade is difficult to grasp, given the above-mentioned unstable factors.</p>
<p>Tea Merchants' Representatives Go to Nanjing to Petition to Save the Current Difficulties in the Tea Industry</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanghai] The Tea Export Industry Association convened a meeting of all directors and supervisors last Thursday (21st) and decided to send fourteen representatives, including Li Jing, Tang Jishan, Sun Xiaocun, and Wang Zhendong, to Nanjing to present the current difficulties in the tea industry and the remedial measures that should be taken after the implementation of the new foreign exchange management method. They will also request subsidies for the old tea purchased last year, and request the purchase of new tea for the 36th year. The representatives will personally carry the presentation and present everything directly to the Four-Bank Joint Office. It is learned that some of the fourteen representatives have already taken the train to Nanjing on the evening of the 24th, while the rest are scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the morning of the 25th. The main points of the association's presentation to the Four-Bank Joint Office are excerpted as follows: (A) It is requested that the purchase of box tea for the 35th year, which has been approved, should continue to be implemented. However, regarding the tea industry's request for the Four-Bank Joint Office to raise the price of each tea center by 50%, to show consideration and fairness, it is requested that the office reconsider and approve it. (B) If the above method needs to be submitted to higher authorities for decision, it will inevitably be delayed, and the tea merchants are in dire need of rescue. After repeated deliberations, it is proposed that the office approve the organization of a sales committee by the association to be responsible for the export of box tea purchased by the government. The entire tea leaves should be examined for international needs, taking into account the production costs for the 36th year, in order to stabilize the market price and expedite exports. The proceeds, after deducting costs and all incidental expenses, the net profit is intended to be half paid to the national treasury, and half used to subsidize tea merchants, in order to maintain national economic policies and to make up for losses. (C) If the implementation of the B method is still difficult, and according to the actual production cost of the 36th year, it is more than three times higher than the purchase price of the 35th year box tea. If China Trust or other Chinese and foreign exporters sell box tea at low prices to the outside world, the high-cost box tea owned by tea merchants will inevitably be in a desperate situation. Therefore, in order to comprehensively plan and take into account both sides, it is proposed that the government handle the 35th year box tea and the 36th year box tea together. If the China Trust Bureau is also responsible for purchasing the 36th year box tea, this difficulty can be fundamentally resolved. Otherwise, it is proposed that tea merchants repurchase the 35th year box tea at the original price plus interest and sell it themselves, which can stabilize the international market and avoid losses from the high-cost box tea of the 36th year.</p>
<p>Pawnshops List Seven Major Reasons Against the Redemption and Guarantee Method</p>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Pawnbrokers Association, due to the police department's order to implement the revised method of restricting the redemption and guarantee of pledges within ten days, the association's members believe that this decree not only deprives the freedom of the vast majority of citizens (pledgers), but also hinders the entire industry's livelihood. They have already stated their reasons and requested the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to forward their request to the mayor to revoke the order, and request the Shanghai Municipal Council to implement its original resolution to revoke this ban. The association hosted the Shanghai news media at the Atlantic Restaurant yesterday to explain the process. The seven major reasons listed by the industry are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>First, pawnbroking is a private financial institution with absolute material credit. Because of its simple lending procedures and good customs, it does have the effect of assisting the country and regulating the economy of ordinary people.</p>
<p>Second, pawnbroking is closely related to the economy of ordinary people, and the government has always had special management regulations for this industry. There has never been such a policy of depriving the freedom of pledgers and merchants in the past, and it should not be implemented on this day of democratic beginnings.</p>
<p>Third, copying citizens' certificates is indeed the tyranny of enemy puppets. Now that national identity cards have not been issued, it is necessary for those who pledge things to have a guarantor prepared.</p>
<p>Fourth, Chinese customs and human feelings value integrity and regard pledging as shameful. Forcing them to declare is tantamount to destroying good customs.</p>
<p>Fifth, military and political personnel passing through Shanghai are endless. Many are looking for relatives and friends who are not encountered, and those who pledge things. If it is necessary to require them to read and copy their identity cards, it is indeed impossible in fact.</p>
<p>Sixth, many poor people in Shanghai, such as rickshaw drivers and peddlers, rely on pawnbroking in the morning and evening to support their lives. Requiring them to provide a guarantee is no different from cutting off their livelihood.</p>
<p>Seventh, the purpose of this case is nothing more than to prevent stolen goods. This industry has always been very strict about preventing stolen goods. Even if one is occasionally deceived into pledging stolen goods, the purpose of selling the stolen goods has been achieved, and they are living a carefree life. Why need to find them again? And pawnbroking has a pledge period of two months, which can be investigated at ease. The effect of preventing stolen goods has not been verified, and the harm to the people is already profound.</p>
<p>Taiwan Sugar Seeks Exports to Japan</p>
<p>Since the government promulgated new regulations on foreign exchange management, Chinese and foreign exporters have shown active signs. Taiwan Sugar Corporation, in order to expand overseas trade, had previously exported sugar to various parts of Nanyang, amounting to several hundred tons per month, and once contacted the MacArthur Headquarters through the China Trust Bureau, and prepared to export a large amount of sugar to Japan in order to earn foreign exchange.</p>
<p>It is learned that Mr. Shen Zhennan, the general manager of the company, has arrived in Shanghai from Taiwan Province on the Hualian Wheel on the 22nd in order to continue to negotiate the export of Taiwan sugar to Japan. According to Mr. Shen, he plans to go to Nanjing next week to report the company's business to the authorities and negotiate with relevant parties on the issue of Taiwan sugar being transported to Japan. If the price is right, it is possible that 25,000 tons of "medium sand" will be shipped this year, but the price is hoped not to exceed 1.2 US cents per pound.</p>
<p>Also, the sugar market was stable and rising the day before yesterday, and sugar from Taiwan was tight. According to the association's division, 29th-period warehouse receipts for medium sand white were 68,000 to 72,300 yuan, up 12,000 yuan. The fourth-and-a-half white warehouse receipt was 795,000 yuan, Shantou green was 520,000 yuan, followed by 500,000 yuan. Red oil was 565,000 yuan, totaling hundreds of packages. Xinghua white bagged was 710,000 yuan, ordinary bagged was 660,000 yuan, Xinghua red was 580,000 yuan, followed by 550,000 yuan, with more than 200 transactions. Qing was 435,000 to 430,000 yuan, with about 400 packages.</p>
<p>How to Lift Control of Yarn and Cloth; The Authorities Are Still Carefully Considering It; The Reproduction Industry Exchanges Views with the Textile Adjustment Committee</p>
<p>In the past few days, the market price of yarn and cloth has inevitably risen, even though the price of yarn allocated by the Textile Adjustment Committee has remained the same. Although the big rise is limited, people outside the industry have been stirred. According to people in the industry, there is no reason for the price of yarn to rise. The allocation of yarn to the reproduction industry increased last week, and the supply and demand in Shanghai is more abundant than before. However, the quota for shipping south and north was being processed last week, and the allocation of yarn by yarn number was opened and then stopped. The disaster relief surcharge will begin again this week, and the market is inevitably tense, so the price has risen slightly. In particular, the price of cloth has been weak for a long time, and it has only recently rebounded, but judging from the cost, the rebound is only enough to break even.</p>
<p>Regarding the recent rumors of lifting the ban on yarn and cloth exports and the abolition of special controls on domestic shipping to the south and north, a responsible person in the industry revealed that, in principle, it can invite the authorities' sympathetic consideration. However, a universal lifting of the ban, to prevent stimulating domestic market prices, is certainly impossible. A limited lifting of the ban can be expected. The abolition of special controls on north-south shipping will be implemented simultaneously with the public warehouse system, and how the public warehouse system can be better than quota sales is still being planned. In the current situation, easing the quota and giving manufacturers a natural adjustment function is the most appropriate. It is heard that several giants in the "reproduction industry" recently invited Liu Siying, the acting chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee, and others to exchange views widely. Lu Gufan, director of the South China region, was also invited to attend. All believe that in the midst of Japan's opening of foreign trade, the textile adjustment method needs to be reconsidered.</p>

<p>Little Pleasure Boat Poems by Hong Weifa</p>
<p>Twenty-one of Yangzhou Continuation Dreams</p>
<p>I have mentioned the Slender West Lake before, and it is still the only place to visit in Yangzhou. There are many tourists on the lake, and naturally there are many pleasure boats that have sprung up to meet the demand. The boat women who row the pleasure boats are some wildflowers and weeds on the lake. There are people who flirt with these women now, but how could they have been avoided in the past? It's just that the tourists of the past were more elegant, and we can get a glimpse of this from the "Little Pleasure Boat Poems."</p>
<p>The "Little Pleasure Boat Poems" were written by Xin Buyun Hanqing, a senior scholar in Yangzhou who was "thin-faced and melon-shaped, with bones and a kind appearance, frustrated and even more uninhibited, hoping to relieve his worries" (as stated in Ji Liangong's Preface to the Little Pleasure Boat Poems). There are a hundred quatrains, written in the years of Guangxu Yihai and Gengzi. His preface states: "North of Hongqiao in Yangzhou is Changchun Lake, or Slender West Lake. Painted boats and singing were prosperous in the past, but with a change of fortune, people have moved on. Fishermen around the lake now carry passengers in melon-skin boats. In the setting sun and moonlight, amid the shadows of the clouds and waves, one or two disheveled and roughly dressed people are interspersed. Their beautiful words and flirtations are half natural. Although they are not the lofty sentiments of beauties and celebrities of the past, they are still better than the vulgar embrace of merchants and lewd women!" It can be seen that the mingling of tourists and boat women on the lake in the past was neither lofty nor vulgar.</p>
<p>Mr. Xin passed away in the summer of Guangxu Renyin. These "Little Pleasure Boat Poems" were published after Mr. Xin's death with funds raised by the members of the Yechun Houshe. I recently obtained a manuscript from his son and compared it with the printed version. There are many differences in words and sentences. Furthermore, there are two quatrains in the printed version:</p>
<p>Everyone waves their fans, sweat covering their bodies, fourteen people in a narrow lake boat; a new record of a Stone, not distinguishing who is the master and who is the guest.</p>
<p>Lunch at Fahai, the setting sun slanting, the steamed duckling looks like a crow; the glutton is so greedy that he devises a special plan, sharing the pig's head with the little silver girl.</p>
<p>Which are not in the manuscript. And there are also two quatrains in the manuscript:</p>
<p>Passing Xiaojinshan, crossing the Five Pavilion Bridge, still taking a trip on the Stinky Water River; even more delighted that new chrysanthemums are planted this year, discussing going to catch crabs in autumn.</p>
<p>The Lu sisters form their own group, the lame and yellow-haired each excel in their field; they also want to attract people to enter the scenic spot, but where does our home lie other than in the land of Water and Clouds?</p>
<p>Which are not in the printed version. Whether the phrases "Stinky Water" and "lame" were too exaggerated when publishing, far from the actual situation, and two more poems were added, or there were already differences in the transmission of manuscripts at that time, is unknown.</p>
<p>The little pleasure boat is commonly known as the little rowboat. I have already mentioned the form of the little rowboat in recent times in the article "Boat Women," but in the beginning it was not like this. There is a quatrain in the printed version of the Little Pleasure Boat Poems:</p>
<p>Why must there be an awning for coolness and comfort, sending people back and forth in the setting sun; it is often heard that the boatmen murmur, regretting being a man and should have castrated himself!</p>
<p>It can be seen that the little rowboat originally had no awning. As for the business of the little rowboat rowed by the boat women being prosperous, which makes the male boatmen jealous, that is still the case today.</p>
<p>At that time, many of the boat women were famous for a time and were appreciated by elegant gentlemen. And those boat women were also very diligent in serving a group of elegant gentlemen, such as:</p>
<p>Lu's Village is located on the westernmost edge, cutting chives to keep guests, the intention is particularly virtuous; the price of meals and wine is so cheap, it only costs six corners of a little dragon coin. (The manuscript version reads: "Lu's Village in the land of Water and Clouds, cutting chives to keep guests, the intention is interesting; the price of meals and wine is really cheap, both cost six corners of a little dragon yuan.")</p>
<p>Chips, foreign coins, all kinds of colors are complete, picking up cards, sitting and narrating, recognizing east and west; the village girl treats guests with charm, boiled river fish and vinegar-glazed chicken.</p>
<p>Poetic frenzy can't match the豪气 of drinking frenzy, dipping the mouse-hair brush in thick ink; winning the beauty to dust the paper in person, a branch of unruliness to be a boat oar. (The first sentence of the manuscript version, "can't match," is "not as good as," and the fourth sentence reads, "the style is only suitable for us.")</p>
<p>For the love of the second famous flower, who</p>
<h3>"Modern Wu Song" Yang Yangyi Subdues the Tiger Plague in Shunchang County</h3>
<p>[Our Fuzhou, 18th Dispatch] In recent years, the tiger menace has been rampant in Shunchang County, northern Fujian. Not only are various villages alarmed, but tigers have even dared to enter the county town in broad daylight, causing officials and civilians to flee in terror. Recently, the tiger plague has intensified, with villagers being devoured while cutting firewood on the mountains, causing widespread panic. The various sectors of the county prepared a substantial reward and sought to hire a "modern Wu Song" from Fuzhou. Although there were many applicants, most did not meet the requirements. Then, Yang Yangyi, a technician from the Institute of Zoology and Botany of the Provincial Research Institute, who had experience in tiger hunting, volunteered to go in his personal capacity. It is reported that after his arrival, Mr. Yang encountered a staggering tiger in a certain area of Shangyang Township. He leaped onto a treetop and unexpectedly shot the tiger in a vital spot. This ferocious tiger, which had plagued the region, immediately collapsed to the ground and died. Upon hearing the news, the villagers rushed to see it. Those who knew the tiger said it was one of the most ferocious in Shunchang. The people rejoiced, and the villages celebrated with cannon fire, jointly celebrating peace. It is reported that Mr. Yang is still in the county, preparing to eradicate the tiger plague. (Special Correspondent Zheng Yu)</p>

<p>A Scene of New Recruits Enlisting in Fengxian: Cai Xiongjie Volunteers for Military Service and Donates Settlement Allowance to Serve the Country</p>
<p>[Our Fengxian, 23rd Dispatch] This year, 325 new recruits from this county have been fully conscripted (the county's quota was 360, but 35 were unfit due to physical reasons). Tang Butao, the Deputy Commander of the Songjiang Military District, led the troop reception unit to the county. On the morning of the 23rd, they were inspected and received separately. Around 11:00 AM, local agencies and organizations held a grand send-off rally for the new recruits at the Fengqing Sports Field. More than a thousand people participated. Chairman Cheng of the Council presided over the rally, and Deputy Commander Tang and County Magistrate Xi delivered speeches of farewell. Lastly, Cai Xiongjie, a new recruit, gave a reply on behalf of all recruits. Female students from the county's orphanage presented a wreath. Cai Xiongjie is a young man from Nanqiao Town in this county. He usually served in the Nanqiao Militia. This time, Mr. Cai sacrificed his family for the country, volunteered for military service, and donated all of his settlement allowance of twelve shi of white rice to the county's charitable organizations (six shi for the infant care center and six shi for the orphanage), demonstrating patriotism and commendable enthusiasm.

<h3>Hangzhou's Private Cotton Mill Faces a New Crisis</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou, 20th Dispatch] Eight kilometers away from downtown Hangzhou, at Gongchen Bridge, stands Hangzhou First Cotton Mill, one of the largest factories in Zhejiang. It covers an area of more than 100 mu, has 20,000 spindles, and employs more than 1,500 workers. The reporter had the opportunity to visit the entire operation of the factory and learned about the new crisis facing private industry.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of Mr. Pan Hongding, the factory's assistant manager, I visited the cotton cleaning machine, roving machine, spinning machine, fine cloth machine, preparation room, machine room, dyeing room, and packing room. Among these many machines, almost half were manufactured in the United States and Britain around 1897, and the other half were from 1929. Because the factory was originally established during the Qing Dynasty, then owned by the Sanyou Industrial Society, and later sold to the current general manager, Mr. Zhang Wenkui, and others, the machines are relatively old. They spin yarn up to 22 counts and down to 10 or 12 counts, producing about 20 bales per day, each bale containing 40 small packages, each weighing 10 pounds. They weave about 500-600 dozen towels and 500 blankets per day, and 300 bolts of fine cloth. However, during our visit, we noticed that many of the weaving machines were idle. It is said that there are 600 machines in total, but only 200-300 are currently operating because there is a shortage of yarn, preventing large-scale production. Most of the yarn currently spun is American cotton handed over by the General Association, which is then spun into yarn and handed back to the General Association, which resells it to other cloth factories at market prices. It is said that American cotton can be spun into yarn of 20 counts or higher. Domestic cotton, such as that from Nantong, Tongzhou, and Shashi, can only be spun into yarn of 20 counts or lower. Cotton from Yuyao has even shorter fibers and can only be spun to about 12 counts. However, the credit of Yuyao cotton merchants is not very good; they often delay delivery after receiving a deposit. Ordinary small towns generally welcome 12-count yarn because it can be used to knit socks and coarse cloth. Rural people particularly welcome it. Recently, the situation of private factories losing money has become very serious. For example, the cost of producing a bale of 20-count yarn is over 10.01 million yuan, while the official price allows only 9.2-9.3 million yuan per bale. The cost of each bolt of fine cloth is over 400,000 yuan, while the selling price is only about 370,000 yuan. The high cost is due to three reasons: first, the machines are old and not efficient enough; second, the workers' productivity is low; and third, the raw materials are expensive. The recent low selling price of yarn and cloth is due to the opening of trade with Japan. Japanese yarn and cloth will be imported. Recently, Japanese cloth has arrived in Shanghai, costing only 200,000 yuan per bolt. Another reason is that the China Textile Corporation (中紡公司) uses foreign exchange to order large quantities of American cotton from abroad, spins it into yarn, and then sells it at cost. Private companies cannot</p>
<p>obtain large amounts of foreign exchange to order American cotton, so the price of yarn from Zhongfang and even the General Association is lower, and private cotton mills cannot recover their costs.</p>
<p>Hangzhou First Cotton Mill can be considered the only large-scale cotton mill in Zhejiang because few other cotton mills have more than 10,000 spindles. The current state of this cotton mill deserves our attention. From the perspective of addressing the root cause, we should enrich our own raw materials. Places like Yuyao, which are large cotton producing areas, should quickly improve planting methods. If the government cannot improve all cotton producing areas at once, it can incentivize the people to do so. If raw materials are provided locally, a lot of capital can be saved, and costs will be reduced. Next, we should</p>
<p>actively train workers to increase their interest in research. The factory can set up bonuses and adopt Taylor's scientific management methods to give workers a strong interest in improving their work, which can also reduce costs.</p>
<p>The temporary solution is to restrict the import of Japanese cotton yarn and cloth, and even ban imports if necessary. Because China's fragile industry, and among the fragile industries, the cotton yarn and cloth weaving factories, which occupy an important position, will be in danger if Japanese cotton yarn and cloth are dumped in large quantities. Secondly, the China Textile Corporation and the General Association should support private cotton mills so that private cotton mills can</p>
<p>have the opportunity to recover. Because cotton mills, etc., are ultimately light industry, Mr. Sun Yat-sen stipulated in his Principle of People's Livelihood that light industry can be operated by the people and should be encouraged for private operation. Now, regardless of the consequences, having foreign exchange to purchase American cotton and calculating that the cost is sufficient, they sell it without considering the losses of private factories. This is not right. The government established the China Textile Corporation, claiming to support private cotton mills. Now, private cotton mills are truly in need of support. We visited the factory and were deeply impressed by the spirit of the management to strive for the enterprise. (Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng)</p>

<h3>Table of Subjects for University Departments and Faculties: The Department in Charge of the Ministry of Education Has Drafted It and Will Approve and Announce It After the Summer Vacation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] The Ministry of Education's revision of the curriculum standards for various university departments and faculties (including both arts and sciences, i.e., arts, law, education, commerce, science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine) will not be as specific as the curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools, which concretely prescribe teaching hours, teaching material content, and teaching methods. Instead, it will simplify the subjects taught in the various departments and faculties of universities and stipulate a table of subjects for required courses. This will provide a common principle for the various departments and faculties of universities in teaching required courses, and allow for adaptation to local conditions and individualized instruction based on the actual circumstances of each school for the selection of elective courses. Regarding teaching materials and methods, the emphasis is on flexible application rather than strict adherence. Therefore, universities do not need to revise curriculum standards, but only need to stipulate a table of subjects for each department and faculty. It is reported that this table of subjects has been drafted by the department in charge of the Ministry of Education and has been circulated to external educational experts for comments. The Ministry of Education has recently compiled and organized the experts' opinions, which is about to be completed. Minister Zhu will review it after returning from the Northeast. If time permits, he plans to convene a meeting of experts to make the final decision, aiming to approve and announce it for implementation after the summer vacation.</p>
