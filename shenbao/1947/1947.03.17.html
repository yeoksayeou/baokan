<h3>大連普蘭店間集兵六萬　共軍圖抗拒接收　軍事視察談遼東局勢</h3>
<p>〔本報潘陽十六日電〕據某軍事觀察家談：以數月來共軍不斷增援及犯擾情形判斷，共軍實有拚死「保衛」大連，拒絕政府按收之企圖與決心。蓋大連爲冀魯共軍主要補給基地，及鮮北華北連絡樞紐，其軍事政治經濟上關係影響全局極大，共軍自去冬將遼南所有殘部退集石河以北地區，依靠特殊勢力，積極補充訓練，於是其獨立師等部，乃吿復活，嗣後其第十二，第廿九兩旅，亦先後進入該特殊區域，至第十一旅則始終未得有進入機會。此外，由魯境增援一部，並另抽調幹部就地編組三個團，最近則又有韓共在大連登陸，如此，普蘭店至大連間合計其總兵力，包括正規及變相共軍，已在六萬人以上。國軍將來接收大連任務，決非不流血所可達成，共軍將全力抗拒，乃意料中事，惟我待命前進之國軍士氣極旺盛，並有充份信心。國軍接攻任務達成後，整個遼南地區可不復有共軍爲息矣。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十六日電〕大連接收之準備工作已　完成，普蘭店等地國軍正爲接收人負掃除各種障碍，龔學遂下週可來瀋，辦理接收事宜。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕主席十六日下午九時召見　英斌，對接收大迎問題指示甚多。</p>
<p>〔本報長春十六日電〕農安德惠外圍戰事，國軍開始出　後，共軍即呈潰敗，刻國軍正緊縮長春濃安德惠　之口袋，共軍被包圍者有第一·第二·第三·及十七·十八師，沿長洮綫北上國軍，今午十二時與農安守軍會師。</p>
<h3>冀察熱聯防不確　王鴻韶對記者暢談軍情</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十六日電〕北平行轅參謀長王鴻韶，應平市記者聯誼會之請，今晨暢談軍事現勢：（一）察綏方面：綏遠安定，僅與外省接壞地之淸水河，托克托，和林，　鎭等地，時有小滋擾，豐鎭四南有共軍綏　軍區，置兵整訓，綏北外蒙接境地帶，時見外蒙小部隊活動，搜索情報。察省沽源北方平定堡附近，有共軍千餘人，察東赤城延慶等地，有共軍三個團，察南繁山堡前日有共軍竄擾。（二）翼省國軍收復谷城後，國軍未再進，刻共軍一部竄冀西山地，大部竄冀中平原，永定河南有二個旅，無大動作，冀東近兩軍，皆無大活動，北寗綫蘆台南常有小破報，鐵路南有共軍竄擾，國軍仍不斷保護　交通治安。</p>
<p>〔又電〕據王鴻韶稱：外傳冀察熟聯防不確，刻熱河仍歸東北行轅。惟前决熟在京國大代表，及最近綏政檢討會時，建議中央將熱河劃歸北平行轅，但迄今尙未奉到中央關於此事之命令。渠對外傳十二戰區自平漢北段調回事，未承認亦未否認，僅謂軍隊調動係兵家常事，並云平漢北段國軍力量未减弱。</p>
<h3>東北共軍內部磨擦日趨深刻</h3>
<p>〔中央社长春十六日電〕延安主戰派，前以東北民主聯軍總司令林彪，不足使東北人民信仰，且其黨履太淺，恐不能堅定意志，久有更換張學思之動議，林之裎屬於聞悉後，曾表未決人不受張指揮，因之兩部隊間發生齷齪，此種磨擦，最近已日趨深刻此種磨控，最近已日趨深刻。</p>
<h3>國軍收復金盆灣</h3>
<p>爲賀能指揮部所在地</p>
<p>〔本報西安十六日電〕國軍今午收復賀龍總指揮部所在地及延安軍事機關集中地之金盆灣，該處屬甘泉縣，即汾川河南岸國軍前日收復之臨眞鎭以西二十公里，由此重要據點沿大路西北行十五公里，即入延安縣境，再行二十公里，到蓮縣城。</p>

<h3>全會花絮</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕全會花絮：</p>
<p>（一）昨日天氣陰霾，層雲密布，今日一碧晴天，氣候亦轉暖和，會塲頓顯活躍，到會中委二二三人，監委亦達六六人，會內空氣亦較熱鬧許多，惟以國民大會堂塲子寬廣，又仍顯得十分稀疏，但較之過去幾年，中央全會如重慶的國府大禮堂，地小人擠，以及去歲二中全會借用重慶軍委會大禮堂，也顯得擁擠充塞之悄形，逈然不同。某中委謂，陪都的確不及首都，確係的論。</p>
<p>（二）今日首决大會，主席爲孫科·左爲秘書長吳鐵城，方値六秩華誕之後，西裝畢挺，不時離席，接洽指揮，至爲忙碌，右爲副秘書長王啓江，兩旁一爲新任南京民政局局長張壽賢，一爲即將赴法主持巴黎我國新聞處主任之汪公紀，此數位人物，照例仍端坐主席合上，運筆如飛，駕輕就熟，應付裕如，而又代表堂堂，爲大會增色不少。</p>
<p>（三）大會中因各報社記者均無法出席，因之，有賴現役報人之中委親自出馬執筆。中委中有報人資格者爲中央日報董事長陳布雷，申報社長潘公展，新聞報社長程滄波，中央社社長蕭同茲，中央日報社長馬星野，和平日報社長黃少谷，東南日報社長胡健中及主筆胡秋源等，馬社長昨日在中央日報親撰「全會珍屑」稿，爲該社增色不少。衆議彼等開會，不忘新聞本職，爲讀者服務，精神可佩。</p>
<p>（四）今日首次大會中重要節目，爲王外長報吿外交，報吿時，全塲寂然無聲，凝神靜聽，情緒緊張。王外長發言頓挫有序，軍節分明，有條不紊，不脫大學老敎授風度，聽者自始至終，屏息端坐至二小時之久，言者譽王外長能說能行，折衝國際，　壇確非易事。王氏昨日報吿之前，係與羅家倫同車蒞會，王坐第二排第一位，登台前閉目靜思，養精會神，登台之後，滔滔不絕，有條有理，全塲對王外長言才無不折服。</p>
<p>（五）外長王世杰今日報吿外交問題時，兩　似較上屆二中全會時增添白髮不少，但嗓子仍亮，直達傷底，報吿時，全憑記憶，報吿年月數字，絲毫不亂，所分章節，先爲中國與聯合國之關係及其所處之地位，次爲中美外交及中蘇外交折衝之經過，再次爲中日問題與越南問題，有如宣讀講義，有條不紊。王氏報吿之前，曾謂：「各位出塲之後，必爲記者包圍」，希爲注憲，散會後，各報記者紛紛向出席中委探詢，但均各守口如瓶，未得要領，王氏可謂有先見之明。</p>
<p>（六）今晨首次會議開會後吳秘書長鐵城首宣布爲死難革命先烈同志致哀三分鐘，全塲肅然，其後又宣讀豫省來電，謂黃河花園口堵口，十五日黎明慶吿合龍完工，全塲聞訊，突起熟烈堂聲，爲數十萬災民慶幸。</p>
<p>（七）今日總裁未親蒞會塲，昨日穿黃呢中山裝步入主席合時，滿面笑容，眼看國民黨完成還政於民工作，心中似有無限安慰。今日　景德戴無頂瓜皮帽，頗像土耳其人，居正之小型維吾兒式小帽及丁惟汾奇特小帽，頗引人注目。</p>
<p>（八）二中全會至三中全會爲期恰爲一年，黨同志中增添白髮者不少，一眼望去，　霜皓然，似乎白髮中委較烏髮者爲多，但各人白的不同，邵力子滿頭星霜，陳誠·陳立夫鬢白而頂尙灰，陳樹人黑白相間，張知本前白而後猶烏，白崇禧。白雲梯雖然姓白，卻無白髮。</p>
<p>（九）宣言起草委會即推孫科·戴傳賢。陳布霄·邵力子。王世杰·潘公展。羅家倫·程中行·洪蘭友等九人，今日又加推中宣部副部長李維果及和平日報社長黃少谷參加，李·黃兩氏均爲靑年團常務幹事，在黨多年，少年老成，宜可　此重任。</p>

<h3>對會外討論中國問題建議　馬歇爾已斷然拒絕　表示蘇方如提出駐軍問題可加考慮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕華盛頓十六日廣播：據悉：馬歇爾已斷然拒絕在蘇京會外討論中國內政問題，但表示如莫洛托夫提出中國境內美蘇駐軍問題時，當可另作考慮。</p>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科十五日電〕迄今深夜為止，馬歇爾仍未答覆蘇外長關於中國問題之函件。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十五日電〕貝文在肯定答覆莫洛托夫之建議以前，猶須等待本國政府之　令，然無論如何，渠反對以超過交換意見之方式，討論中國問題之立場，將不致變更。渠於一九四五年莫斯科討論時，即係本此立場。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科十五日電〕馬歇爾與貝文二世，鑒於中國之反對參加，將重新審慎考慮莫洛托夫之建議。且二氏留居莫斯科期際頗為忙碌，故亦不　望以中國問題置於首要地位。貝文且曾宣稱：如果舉行此項會議，則當以核討一九四九年協定之履行為限，貝文並保證在未與各自治領交換意見之前，不討論遠東問題。此間認為莫洛托夫有撤銷建議之可能，素以同情蘇聯審稱之中國左翼份子竟亦與中國右翼份子採取一致步驟，反對在此討論中國問題，此事則似在意料之外。</p>

<p>中國中央兩航空公司停航兩月之後，已於昨日起復航，自滬飛出者四架，自京飛出者三架，旅客因飛機迭次失事，咸抱戒心，故搭客不甚踴躍，這一件事雖屬小事，但其意義却非常重大，有關我國航空事業的前途，值得我們的注意。緣自我國成立民用航空公司以來，各方人士嘖有頗言，綜其要點，不外管理不當，設備不良，連絡不靈，或空勤人員走私舞弊，玩忽職務，態度驕傲，以致隨時發生過重，損壞和失事現象。輿論方面時有改善民用航空保障旅客安全的呼籲，奈以人謀不減，終未能發揮人力克服天然的效力，致數月以來，觸目驚心的飛機失事慘劇，竟屢見不鮮，造成我國航空界空前未有的厄運。經過不斷的災難後，政府為加強民用航空事業的管制，設立了民航局；爲了中央中國航空公司內部的整頓，各綫班機停航約二月，至昨天始復航。</p>
<p>交通事業的活動，如人肢體的血脈，需要流通，不可停滯，發生臃腫痿痹的現象。現在央機復航，空中交通活潑，見可喜的事，惟內部整頓和飛機設備，是否盡愜人意，又不無疑問。因此，我們對於今後民用航空事業的進步，仍有無限的關懷。</p>
<p>查航空事業，為科學工具的組合，務必配合科學管理，　能發揮其本有性能。同時科學的設備，日新月異，務必隨時探取高度技術，　能有日新又日的進步。我國中央中國兩航空公司，在民用航空界已具有相當歷史，組織和資金均極雄厚，在大後方抗戰時期，曾有良好的貢獻，惟復員以後，交通部管理疏忽，公司組織人事未臻合理，則不無遺憾。自去年圣誕節三機在滬肇事後，交通部乃有民航局的設置，數月以來民航局的工作，如氣象設備的充實，保障航空安全特別預防的措施，及對央航中航兩公司的監督，機務和管理人員的調整，均為進步的表現，尚差強人意。不過，當飛機迭次肇事之後，監察院及參政會先後有調查報告發表，且中航一四五號滬渝班機在鄂西天門失事一案。竟有携带金條二百條之說，致飛機失去平衡罹此慘禍。迄今各次慘案被難家屬，尚在進行控訴，未獲絲毫結果，徒喚奈何。論理，交通當局應於飛機復航後，將過去飛機迭次肇事原因有明白的宣佈，以釋羣疑；對於被難家屬之呼籲，尤不可以一紙公文，表示哀悼被難乘客，而將過去含糊了事！事實上，航空公司的失事責任，應該明白；被難家屬的怨訴，應該救濟。從行政上說應如此，從責任觀念上說亦應如此，從道德上說更應如此！</p>
<p>至於今後民用航空事業之改進，科學技術部份有賴專家之探討，而其他各端，監察員和參政會的調查報告書，均附改進意見多項，均甚切要。現在央機復航期間，我們願略抒己見，以為各方改進意見的補充，希望關係方面參證（一）民航事業有關航行，責任，賠償，撫卹等，應有民用航空法，此為一種社會安全的立法，今日我國似有此必要；（二）復航後之票價不可提高，而保險費或公司附加保險費則可以增加。由於保險費的增加，公司章程對乘客撫卹金額亦應提高，不可與公司職員懸殊，尤不可與外籍乘客撫卹有別，發生草菅本國乘客姓名之嫌。因生命保險費的提高，並可加車公司之謹慎心理；（三）凡事豫則立，公司應有充分的降落傘及救生帶的設備，預先授乘客的安全運用技術，減少萬一之危險；（四）航空交通檢查制度似應恢復，杜絕飛機或乘客潛帶黃金及違禁物品，以保障旅途之安全；（五）民用航空與軍用機應有飛行協定，如往返航綫飛行高度之規定，如緊急狀態准民航機降落軍用機場等。凡此種種，不僅有裨乘客安全保障，並可補救萌芽中的我國民用航空，在社會安全救濟制度上的缺陷。</p>
<p>要之，我國民用航空事業，現正處於危難的階段，落伍要進步，百尺竿頭自可更近一層，撥雲霧而見青天了。國家建設的前途很遠大，此際此刻，正值國力維艱之秋，國家的元氣和航空界的元氣，實不堪再挫了！</p>
<h3>評議工資辦法述評</h3>
<p>評議工資實施辦法，已經全國經濟委員會物價委員會通過，全文凡十四條。究其用意，不外代替職工的定量分配，而另予以適當的補償。緣嚴格管制物價之地點，行政院祗指定京滬兩市。在此兩市內，凡向依生活指數計算的薪工，均以本年一月份為最高額，而另以日用品六種之評價配給，作為補助。其餘各黨重要城市之生活指數，雖同遭凍結，却未實行日用品之定量分配，故不得不酌予調　以昭平允。試閱此項辦法第一條，明日將行政院指定嚴格管制物價之地點除外，而第六條所定增減工資之物價，又為米·煤·油·鹽·棉布·糖六種，與現在分配職工之平價物品完全相同，其意義自可了然。</p>
<p>這裏所要特別指出的是定量分配的辦法，較為固定，而劃一，評議工資辦法，則頗具彈性，在運用上不無得失可言。現在上海，雖以實物配給緩不濟急，業已折發差金，事實上與酌加工資無大差異。但是項差金，係從零售市價核算出來，完全是機械性的，究與經過評議的工資不同。因為一經評議，便不無伸縮餘地。而案第六條明言：「參酌當時當地主要日用必需品物價詳細情形，作增減工資之評議，報請當地政府核定之。」第七條又說：「實施工資評議時，應與鄰近地區密取聯繫。」假如純屬機械性，與實物配給或折發差金一般，則「參酌」，「核定」，「聯繫」等詞，便不適用。</p>
<p>在物價穩定的時候，此項補貼辦法，採取機械性的也好，採取伸縮性的也未嘗不好。其在漲落劇烈的時候，則在理論上言，似以採取後者即評議方式較為靈便。因為底盤的生活指數既經凍結，而貼補的定量配給又一成不變，要實行以不變馭萬變，事實上究竟能否推行盡利，實在未易斷言。</p>
<p>不過評議方式，也有一重要之點必須注意，即原案第八條但書所稱：「未經核定前，不得變更。」是拿一切議價的成例來說，幾乎發現了一個通則，即黑市在前，議價在後。就是說：黑市領導議價，議價跟隨黑市。因此形成了有議價即有黑市的現象。工資與物價不同，論理不支造成黑市。但以議價不甚合理，或遲遲不予決定，致勞資雙方，不得不覓取自行妥洽的途徑，那也就無異於黑市。更以「物價變動，生活費用增加或減少過劇時」，不能及時重行評議，以至工潮不能消減，尤須此次立法的用意不符。所以實施這個評議工資辦法時，必須常常站在自發的立場，尤其要把握住時間性，庶可免除上述的流弊。</p>
<p>自從經濟緊急措施方案頒行以來，工資與物價能否配合最為一經人所注目。現在日用品的配給辦法，折發差金辦法，和評議工資實施辦法，已經先後擬定，在立法上的能事可算已畢。此後的中心工作，當然在於如何穩定物價，而要做到消弭工潮，安定工人生活，尤重在如何妥善運用以上這些辦法。</p>

<h3>波茨坦恊定發見矛盾點　貝文認應予糾正　馬歇爾即將會晤史達林</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十五日電〕員文外相似已在外長會議內，發起糾改波茨坦協定關於德國部份之矛盾點，以應目前情形之需要。員文認為波茨坦協定之原則，有加以重新規定定義之必要，惟此項工作必須以整個協定為基礎，不得予以個別處理。經濟統一之原則，固波茨坦協定最主要之原則，然四强雖承認此一原則，然實施之際仍各自為政，英國已明白表示在四強成立關於執行此項規定之協議前，對於執行他項規定之決議，將表示反對。貝文與莫洛托夫在會議中雖對責不已，然彼等均具有高度之外交技術，使妥協之門，並不因之關閉。馬歇爾為外長會議之新人，其處事之謹愼，頗獲一般好評。試就莫洛托夫討論中國問題之建議而論，馬歇爾於與會之初，　遭此意外問題，但渠未動聲色，仍靜待貝文提出非正式討論之建議，使空氣為之緩和。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科十五日電〕莫斯科老練之觀察家今日預料，美國務卿及其他各外長　將被召至克里姆林宮，與史達林總理會晤。此項傳說給與美國共和黨各參議員之論調一致，此輩敦促馬歇爾向蘇聯元首表明美國在地中海之政策。</p>
<h3>外長會議第六日　商移置流亡人民及土地劃分</h3>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科十五日專電〕四外長之第六日會議，由美國務卿馬歇爾任主席，開會時間達四小時十五分鐘。今日討論之主題為被移置人民及領土之重劃分問題。維辛斯　首對討論對德和的之外表代表工作有所報吿，渠稱，外長代表對是否邀阿爾巴尼亞參與諮詢性會議之事，刻已陷僵局。英外相貝文即提議，阿爾巴爾亞之問題雖不能獲致協議，但外長代表之工作仍需繼續進行。此項建議經討論後，則為各外長所贊同。維辛斯　復對蘇聯若干公民刻仍住於集　營中之事作冗長之聲明。馬歇爾乃解釋美國之立塲，並建議將此一問題交由國際難民組織辦理。蓋國際難民組織，即係為求解決此類嚴重問題而設立者，若四外長會議企圖過問此事，則不唯無補，且將使此事更趨複雜。法外長皮杜爾於討論被移置人民問題時，首次發言，且作極具意義之建議，渠認為國境內之人口密度，旣已較他國為高，故應（一）禁止德國境外之德國少數民族邋入德國；（二）波茨坦會議中所決定之遷移德國人口，應暫行停止；（三）被移置人民不得居留於德國；（四）組織德國移民出境之機構。皮杜爾並表示法國己準備　其容納德人之責任，關於歐洲各國對德持有偏見問題，皮氏建議更具政治家風度。</p>
<p>關於重定疆界問題，莫洛托夫宣讀報吿一紙，而馬歇爾旋即解釋美佔領區中濂界之重新劃定，乃有其歷史經濟及文化上之根據。莫洛托夫建議將來應由盟國管制會通過後，始可更改疆界。但貝文認為盟國管制委員會對此種情事，恐無獲致協議之可能。莫洛托夫欲請外長會議作此項決定，但無人同意其建議。四外長之首週會議，即如此結束。接此四外長之第一週會議中，僅獲致淸理普魯士邦之一項決議，　外長之下次會議將於本月十七日下午四時舉行，預定討論　洛托夫所提出之經濟原則及賠　問題。</p>
<p>被移置人民可列爲四類</p>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科十五日專電〕英外長貝文於討論被移置人民問題時分列彼等為四類；（一）戰俘；（二）聯合國被移置人民；（三）敵國被移置人民；及（四）德國難民與被放逐人民。其中以第二類為最困難，已有兩百萬人民自英國佔領區中返國，目前尙有廿三萬人，其中最多而最令人感覺焦慮者，為十一萬一千波蘭人，次之爲八萬二千五百波羅的海國家之人民，四千七百南斯拉夫人，七八千以上之戰俘，以及二萬九千各國籍未定，但被視為聯合國之人民者。外長會議之政策，為不以武力强其返國，但可用其他方法　速使其在其他地方安居，但不許　等永留德國，目前則以之用於生產工作。</p>
<h3>英美外長會商　巴勒斯坦問題</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十五日電〕據非正式消息：英外相員文與美議務　馬歇爾，已在莫斯科就巴勒斯坦問題從長討論，貝文吿馬卿，美國對於解決猶太人問題之道義上的責任，不能再事躲　。聞巴勒斯坦問題在華盛頓倫敦與莫斯科三地同時討論中。關於英臘　議由各大國組織巴勒斯坦問題委員會一事，聞中法蘇三國代表已表贊同，美國亦無反對之</p>
<h3>美駐英大使抵英倫履新</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十六日電〕美駐英新大使陶格拉斯今日抵此　新，須待英王喬治六世自南非返美，方能呈　國書。</p>
<h3>傳根據杜魯門援助計劃　美將貸我五億元　對外貨款總額達五十七億餘</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十五日電〕「陸海軍日報」今日預料中國等若干國均可根據杜魯門之援助計劃而獲得美國之財政援助。全部援助計劃需費約五十七億五千萬元，中國或可取得其中最大之一份，計五億元。按該報編輯為馬歇爾將軍之摯友，據其撰稱；美國對外援助總額或將達五十七億五千萬元，分配情形如下：希臘土耳其共得四億元，中國得五億元，朝鮮得二億元，奧國得一億五千五百萬元，巴爾幹國家得二億元，德國得四億七千五百萬元，日本及其他太平洋區得二億元。杜魯門係於獲知陸海空軍顧問，馬歇爾將軍及其他專家之事實報告後，始有大規模援助計劃之決定。有稱此項計劃為世界門羅主義者，亦有稱之為新租借法案者，總統之建議不免將干涉各處之自由云。按前述各國可望獲得之數字總額不到五十七億五千萬元，該報並未說明原因，想係其列舉之各國，僅援助目標之一部份云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社開羅十六日電〕埃及政府已決定將英埃商的延長一年，自本月一日起。</p>
<h3>土蘇對海峽問題妥恊之門已關閉　土國政界人士之見解</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社安哥拉十五日電〕關於韃靼尼爾海峽問題，頃　此　政　人士談稱：就土耳其而言，土　獲致妥協之門，業已　　，觀於杜魯門總統向國會所發表之外交政策聲明，蘇聯能獲得滿足其慾望之解決辦法，希望　見涉茫。職是之故，韃靼尼爾海峽殆將維持現狀云。土耳其各界人士對於杜魯門總統之外交政策聲明，一般表示滿意與贊同。此在半官方且在輿論界具有權威之「烏勒斯」報，則其所見略有不同，此間外交界人士對此頗為注意。據某著名經濟學家在該報發表一文稱：「美國考慮在財政上協助土耳其雖甚重要，但並不能解決一切，唯須世界恢復安全，始能使土耳其復興其經濟。」</p>
<h3>美國經濟援希計劃並非干涉希臘內政　國務院要員維拉德宣稱</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十五日電〕美國國務院今晚發表每週之「吾國外交政策」廣播，由中東司副司長維拉德演說稱：吾人並不　干涉希臘之內政，吾人亦不擬使任何政黨執掌政權而抵制另一政黨，　吾人確擬在經濟上協助希臘，俾使希臘人民能在不受威脅之空氣中維持其所意欲之政府方式。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十五日電〕實施杜魯門總統援助希土計劃之立法草案，傳已吿完成，可於星期一由衆院外交委員會主席伊頓向衆議院提出。議會權威方面稱：該草案並不特別限定援助之方式，而將採用與戰時租借方案相仿之方式，分期撥付。此項措施，可使美國派遣經濟及軍事使命團赴希，並將　餘軍用物資移交希土兩國，而正規陸海軍用具亦可能供給兩國。至於軍事使命團之性質將與美國派至南美及中國之軍事團相仿，但出動美國軍隊一節，則不致成為事實云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十五日電〕共和黨參議員塔虎特今日提出美國倘在財政與軍事上援助希臘與土耳其，蘇聯將否宣戰一項問題，要求秉政者發表意見。據稱：「我國高級軍人對於美國實施此項計劃蘇聯將出以戰爭之可能性，如何觀感，余欲知之，蓋蘇聯倘欲强迫在古巴樹立共產政府，吾人殆將出以戰爭，其情形正復相同也。」</p>
<p>希各黨代表電謝美總統</p>
<p>塔虎特發問之日，白宮宣布希臘各黨發言人之謝電，僅共產黨除外。總統布吿中稱此種電文證明各方均欲與美國無保留的合作，保證致力於建設性的復興及忠於和平與自由之主張云。</p>

<h3>杜魯門垂釣　曾接馬卿密函兩通</h3>
<p>〔聯合社弗　里達　　斯特十五日電〕杜魯門總統對其援助希土提案可獲通過一節，顯抱榮興，十九日前將在此間繼續休假。莫斯科官方並無反響，國會清緒又足激動，此皆總統決定暫時休假之因素。據權威方面悉。今日總統出發作四小時釣魚旅行之前，曾接獲國務　馬歇爾密函二通。該項密函係由郵機運來，自絲統　達此問後尙屬初次。十二日練統向國會致詞，事先會完全通知馬　，　後二氏間迄未有電話連絡。總統新用　　羅斯宣稱，如無變化，杜氏於十七日後在凱惠斯特尙將勾留數日。</p>
<h3>麥克納特展期返美</h3>
<p>美菲聞尙有三協定待簽</p>
<p>〔中央社馬尼刺十五日專電〕美駐菲大使麥克納特本定今晨返美，現已展期至十七日或十八日，以待簽訂美菲間其他三項協定，其中包括軍事援助及關於引渡之協定。昨日麥氏曾與羅哈斯總統在此間簽訂軍事基地條約，領事協定，以及漁業協定。</p>
<h3>民主陣綫團結締造和平　顧大使之警闢演說</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十六日廣播；中國駐美大使　維鈞在浮吉尼亞大學發表演說稱：「民主主義必能戰勝共他思想，殆無疑義。和平乃不可分割的，世界繁榮與自由亦莫不然。列　苟不能合作，則國際前途殊爲暗淡可悲。世界局勢因兩種　對思想之存在，面呈錯綜複雜，各國對某一問題所取步　各異，致使合作發生困難，蓋惟有互相諒解，始能進而合作。世界民主陣綫必須聯合起來一致行動。團結力量之大無過於民主勢力之團結，蓋民主勢力之基礎，乃個人之自由意志，面非國家之强迫意志云。</p>
<h3>法保關係惡化　法召回駐保使節</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎十五日電〕官方今日宣佈：法國政府決定停止對保加利亞之貿易談判，並令保國記者兩人於廿四小時內出境，乃係對於保國驅逐法新聞記者波歐夫人之報復，但此舉絕非侵犯新聞自由之謂。保國駐法其他訪員之採訪證滿期後，不再重發，保國記者並不得享有其他外國記者應享之各種便利，但兩國外交關係並不破裂。法駐保公使巴理斯已奉召　　，　告上星期各種事端，包括保魚干涉法公使館存款一事在內。按保國最近發行新幣，凍結舊幣，舊幣流通每人以二千元為限，超出此數將遭干涉，因而引起事件。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十五日電〕法外部發言人稱：保駐巴黎公使已於今日下午離巴黎返索菲亞，想奉有本國　令，渠或不致返巴黎。</p>
<h3>西反政府派活躍　弗朗哥警察破獲秘密機關</h3>
<p>〔合衆社柴拉哥薩十六日電）據今日西當局宣佈：西政府業已破獲一無政府主義及社曾主義者之「叛變陰謀」。據稱，該一組織，曾企圖以炸燬烏特里拉煤　附近之電廠手段，使西班牙加泰隆尼亞省之工業為之停頓。在馬德里，警察亦破獲機關，逮捕被指為恐怖團體團員一百廿二名，並擊斃其領袖兩名。巴塞羅納方面，亦有三人以向一商店投手溜彈之嫌疑被捕。同時又聞陰謀者曾炸毀比爾波至巴塞羅納間之某鐵橋，惟聞此事在未有火車經過前，即行發現。惟當局拒絕透露所謂叛變陰謀事件中，究有若干人被捕。</p>
<h3>防蘇壁壘重鎭　希土政局面面觀</h3>
<p>〔中央社記者王公達安哥拉十五日專電〕中央社記者發現希臘和土耳其為今日反蘇壁壘中重要的一環，彼此的情况迥異。記者在土耳其居留數日，本年二月中曾去希臘觀光，而獲得如上的意見。若干觀察人士也同記者有相同的看法。</p>
<p>土國政府堅強有力</p>
<p>今日的土耳其有强有力的政府，而且遵循着凱末爾所明確訂定的政策，一如中國遵循着國父孫先生的政策。然當土耳其人民遵循着一定政策前進時，他們具有回敎徒精神，不顧國內外的一切評論，而堅決的將政策付諸實施。土耳其國內的政治和軍事情况，是安定的。凱末爾雖然已經死去了十年，但他最親近的同志現任總統伊諾努仍然遵循着他的志願前進，就像蔣主席遵循着孫先生的志願前進一樣。</p>
<p>目前希臘缺乏領袖</p>
<p>目前的希臘幾無全國性領袖之可言，希王喬治根本不是希臘人，希臘王室因為不斷與歐洲王室通婚，而混有德國，丹麥和俄國血統。希王喬治自一九一〇年登基以來，已經由公民投票放逐出國過一次，又有公民投票而兩度被請回國。希臘總理馬克西應斯是一個會任希蠟銀行總裁的銀行家，他不屬於任何黨派，甚至不是一個政界人物，他之所以被任郃為總理，祗是因為他能調協希臘議會中的八個政黨而已。雅典卓越政治家現任希蠟外交部長的蔡爾達里斯，祗不過是最強大右翼黨派的領袖。軸心國佔領希蠟時，他並未離去，而戰前也還是個默默無聞的人士。在領袖的威望上，更是談不上。希臘的知識份子吿記者：「我們不幸不能得到一位像你們蔣主席那樣的領袖。」希臘今日的政府，的確柔弱而無能，土耳其的政府和軍隊，足可以在事前防止任何有左派騷擾嫌疑的舉動。希臘則不然。儘管他有美國的經重武器，英國的飛機，甚至英國式現成的軍服，但他的軍隊顯然不足以防止共黨的睡擾。這一點，從他二月中旬全面殲滅戰的失敗，可以得到證明</p>
<p>土希兩國經濟現狀</p>
<p>土耳其和希臘的全國經濟，都已經動搖，但動搖的情形，也有不同。美金一元値土幣二元八角，但美金一元却換希幣五千元。土耳其端盡全國的資源，以支持他防禦外侮的百萬大軍，而且在咬緊牙根，忍受着苦難，希臘却是凡事依賴外國，而且物價奇高，黑市流行，希臘人允許共黨甚至在他的首都宣傳和作示威遊行，但安卡拉方面，就絕不容許這種現象發生。希蠟至多能向世界表示他是「民主」雖然同時在事實上他是在為壓平武裝的叛變而流血土耳其就從不會放松他嚴厲的壓制工作，而根本不考慮世界各國的評論如何。但奇怪的是二國所得的評論，却都是「法西斯主義」。</p>
<p>斯拉夫人批評一斑</p>
<p>土耳其所遭斯拉夫人的批評，竟此希臘還少，而且民主各國對土耳其的批評，也遠比對希臘少。土耳其在這方面是成功的，因為他採取的是極現實的政策。希臘則不然，他是為他那現實和理想政策的矛盾而苦惱。</p>
<p>希土友好盡捐舊嫌</p>
<p>希土兩國過去頗有夙怨，但過去廿五年中已盡捐舊嫌。自從第二次大戰結束後，土希兩國因為有共防蘇聯侵凌的利害關係而親切如同多年的友邦。杜魯門發表給希土貸款的演說後，兩國關係更為密切。西方諸國如今稱土希為「民主的疆界，」土耳其人認為他們是美蘇衝突的沸點。土耳其人認為他們的祖國，是全中東防止「紅色洪統一的壁壘，土耳其人自認為他們今日的軍隊，雖然還不足與美國相比，但在中東已經無疑是最稱强大，土國的政府也無疑是中東和近東各國中最強有力的了。由於同樣的利害關係，土希兩國如今成為中東反蘇的一大堡壘。土耳其政府報「民族報」認為此事「對世界的和平和安全，有最重大的關係」，因此土希兩國如今也該同時得到美國的援助。</p>
<p>兩國地位極關重要</p>
<p>一般認為防止蘇聯侵略的「衛生帶」是以波羅的海為起點，經過日德蘭半島的柬部，蜿蜒到特里埃斯特港再沿亞得里亞海越希臘北部，黑海，伊朗，印度和朝鮮中部北緯卅八度，面沿白令海直到北冰洋。如此看來，希土確實在這防蘇壁壘佔着重要的地位。</p>
<h3>解決本哲布爭執尼赫魯建議分治　回盟表示反對要求舉行新選舉</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社　霍爾十六日電〕此間消息靈通人士稱：關於尼赫魯擬將本哲布省分成二區之計劃，國會黨與回敎聯盟恐又將發生新爭執。傳尼赫魯已吿知本哲布省總督　金斯，謂大會黨將要求印督蒙巴頓勛爵儘速就任，俾使將該省分成二區。回盟主席眞納對此聞將加以反對，認為此舉勢將使分治後之獨立回敎國，在經濟上蒙受損害，蓋本哲布乃西北邊省及辛德省之經濟柱石故也。因此衆人多以為回盟，殆將要求在該省舉行新選舉，以決定其前途云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞歉新德里十五日電〕官方頃發表公報稱：本哲布省又發生暴動，計有村落五處被搶，死傷頗衆。又悉，剌其普化拿之佐　浦爾村民，本就亦與刹帝利族人發生衝突，死十人，傷十二人。</p>

<h3>日議會下月改選裕仁無投票資格</h3>
<p>松平恒雄將在自由黨魁</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十五日電〕日本議會將於下月改選，日皇裕仁將不得投票，但皇室其他人員或可投票。據東京選民登記局人員稱，國王無投票資格，因新憲法規定其爲「國家之象徵」，置身於政治之外。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京十六日電〕據消息靈通方面稱，前日本駐英大使松平恒雄，或將繼吉田首相出任自由黨黨魁之　。據京都新聞載稱，松平並有領導自由黨與進步黨合併運動之說云。</p>
<h3>楊永清促實施兒童基金計劃</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十五日電〕中國副代表楊永淸，今在聯合國經社理事會上稱，中國竭誠贊同國際兒童緊急基金，並希望各國能及早合作，俾是項基金，能立即付諸實施。按自上屆聯合國大會中設立是項基金以來，迄未開始工作。</p>
<h3>英前陸相培里厦論英美海權關係</h3>
<p>〔聯合社英格　伯明罕十五日電〕英國前陸相培里厦今日在此間發表演說稱：杜魯門總統之援助希土演說，顯示美國本身已明白宣佈其地中海海上　　地位。杜氏之主義不應視作取英國之勢力與主權而代之。反之，前承認英國交卸七大洋上職　乃殊欠平均之負擔。英美二國若欲在履行海洋義務方面推行共同政策，則其分負實施之責，固誼所當然。英美外交之相互連繫，給予世界和平以最大之事實保證。英法條約即將配合事態所正形成之格式。海權國家間此等團結對世界和平機構非惟不致破壞，且足鞏固基礎。</p>
<h3>阿拉伯諸國將承認印尼</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴達維亞十六日電〕據印尼共和國首府日惹今日來訊，阿拉伯同盟代表墨尼頃通知印尼總統蘇卡諾稱，埃及，伊拉克，叙利亞，黎巴嫩，沙地阿刺伯，外的丹及葉門請阿拉伯國家，因與信奉回敎之印尼有宗敎及血統關係，已於去年十一月十八日經阿拉伯同盟發起，一致決定首先承認印尼共和國為主權獨立國，不日將採取正式承認之步驟。</p>

<h3>淞滬鐵路慘劇火車卡車猛撞　看棚夫一時疏忽以致肇禍　軍人警士等九人受傷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日傍晚六時四十五分，離江灣車站的半公里淞滬鐵道與逸仙路交界處，發生火車與卡車互撞慘劇。卡車傾覆，當塲有九人墮車受傷，內且有數人生命危殆。緣有同茂運輸汽車行，於昨日下午五時五十分許，由司機張仁學駕駛三六七六五號卡車，由北火車站駛往吳淞，車上載有搭客多名。中途忽有靑年軍二〇二師二旅四團三連機槍隊及衛生隊列兵二十餘名要求搭車，駕駛者張學仁以載重過度，但亦無法勸阻，結果全部攀登。旋駛抵江灣逸仙路（舊名外馬路）時，因該處道路崎嶇，車身顚波不已，至鐵路馬路交界處，內中一軍人名陳德興者受震擊地受重傷。時即有二二九四號交通警葉章事聞警到來，命將司機連車一併入江灣分局核辦，交涉多時，結果將車折回江灣分局。時爲六時四十五分，天已昏黑，自何家灣站駛滬之火車一列，適行至該處。看棚夫鍾　祥一時疏忽，未將　旗杆放下。此時張學仁駕駛之卡車，正開足馬力，擬通過軌道，煞車不及，與火車頭之後半節相撞，當吿傾覆。火車則略受震動，揚長而去。汽車顚覆，乘客均隨之墜地。重傷者五人，血肉模糊，已人事不知，後由警局消防處救護車趕到，救送鐵路醫院。受傷較輕者一人，亦送鐵路醫院。二人送警察醫院。另一人則送市立第四醫院救治。全部傷者名單如下：（一）送鐵路醫院者：陳德興（傷勢最重），朱耀祖，王康，曹明，周志榮（輕傷）。（以上均靑年軍第二〇二師衛生隊兵）。葉煥玉（二〇二師第一營通訊兵）。（二）送警察醫院者：葉章亭，張學仁。（三）送市立第四醫院者：曹天紅（二〇二師第二旅第四團機槍第三連排長）。</p>

<h3>僞造法幣美鈔機關　屋主張子文投案　同犯已偵獲綫索　一二日內可能一網打盡</h3>

<h3>市中心區放領地未了手續地政局擬定三項處理辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕地政局接管前市府征收原屬江灣·殷行。引翔等區一帶民地五千餘畝，劃建市中心區一案，因原有案卷各表散佚不全，整理困難。前市府曾爲此案組織市中心區建設委員會，暨建設市中心區經濟保管委員會兩機構，並公佈上海市中心區放領地辦法，上海市黨部及政府所屬各機關職員承領市中心區地畝辦法，並訂定征收荒廢金逾期息金暨給付官息等規定，以輔執行之順利。抗戰後工作全部停頓，該區復經敵軍一番毀建，情形變遷殊劇。勝利後迭據原領戶前來請示未了手續，除欠價部份，地政局前經擬具辦法，呈市府核准辦理外，其延不繳銷單契，敵軍圈用地等處理辦法，該局亦已擬定，即將呈奉市府核示。該項辦法爲：</p>
<p>（一）原業主延不繳銷單契部份；公吿原業主限期繳銷單契，逾期宣吿該項單契僅作領價憑證，不生其他效力。</p>
<p>（二）敵軍圈用放領地部份：遵照行政院令四項處理原則，依照補價辦法辦理。</p>
<p>（三）關於荒廢金逾期息金暨給發官息等部份：原卷內並無淸册，稽攷困難，且爲數不多，擬予豁免。</p>
<p>上項辦法將由地政局與淸理前市中心區放領地全案經過情形，一併呈報市府核示。此外地政局爲完成處理該案起見，非獨力所能勝任，故請市府令飭各有關局處組織一臨時處理機構協同進行，俾能早日吿一段落。</p>

<h3>起訴漢奸案多起顧南羣不予起訴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕山西人陳子　，被控於上海淪陷期間，在所謂「還都」以後，敵方根據敵軍管理工廠處理綱要，交還僞方工廠，計有恒大新記紡織廠，廠址在浦東楊思區南街，恒興泰榨油廠，廠址在曹家渡河北，均係由僞方派陳接收，嗣任信大紗廠經理，業經高檢處偵查完畢，以漢奸嫌疑案提起公訴，惟聞陳業已逃回山西。又黃亞强等漢奸嫌疑案，及外籍羅加雪佛區等通敵嫌疑案，均經高檢處起訴。顧南羣被控於南洋醫院院長時，該院內潛伏敵方特務份子甚多，蔣伯誠在南洋醫院治療，即爲敵軍捕獲，勝利後顧因漢奸嫌疑被檢舉，經商檢處偵查後，不予起訴。</p>
<h3>夏佩珍案創先例檢察官抗告勝訴　烟犯若能戒絕得免刑之執行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕勝利復員以來，政府決意禁絕烟毒，本市警政當局對此項決策執行不遺餘力。惟本市淪陷時期，市民受敵人毒化者爲數甚鉅，故司法當局對吸食烟毒犯，仍本積極感化，化莠爲良之旨，予以更新向善之機。地院檢察處，曾依保安處分法，爲吸食鴉片犯夏佩珍，申請免其原判之刑之執行，當時雖經地院以被吿吸食鴉片已久，需執行滿足一年，始可適應四季氣節爲理由，將其聲請駁回。地檢處傳邦檢察官乃向高院抗吿。茲悉，業已爭得法理上之勝訴，高院合議結果，認爲被吿執行禁戒處分已滿二月，經法醫鑑定已無吸食鴉片症象，自與刑　第八十八條第三項所規定之要旨相符，應免其刑之執行。至吸食鴉片之成癮，因季節之交替而有消長，亦無醫理根據，應認爲抗吿爲有理由，原裁定撤銷，夏佩珍所處徒刑免予執行。夏雖已大赦出獄，但已爲今後吸食鴉片犯，於勒戒後，執行徒刑問題上，創一先例。</p>
<h3>附逆販毒嫌疑犯僞引翔鎭長被拘</h3>

<h3>宣傳的新工具　本市電台槪觀</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕上海的廣播電台，戰前有四五十家。勝利後，舊業恢復和新成立的達一百零五家之多，包括公營·商營·外商。半公半商和另有政治背景的外國電台。電台一多，電波顯見紊亂。上海電信局和警備司令部電檢科，遵照交通部規定，上海公營和商營的廣播電台，不得超過十個K.C.（週波），同時外人不得在國內設置電台。幾個月來，經整理取締結果，得到交通部核准許可設立的，現存中華自由·金都。亞美麟記，大中華，大陸，東方華美。元昌鶴鳴，合衆。福音，五洲。合作，民聲·九九·新聲·大中國·新滬。大同。建成及中國文化等十八家。其中亞美麟記，大中華·大陸（原是兩家）三家，共用一個週波，其餘都是兩家共用一個週波。此外，尙有中央廣播事業管理處的「上海」，警察局的「市警」，和正在聲請中的憲兵司令部的「勝利」，是三個公營的電台。</p>
<p>上面的二十一個廣播電台中，市警和勝利，完全是爲它們警察和憲兵本身業務和學術廣播而設，不播廣吿，也無娛樂的節目。福音電台是爲宣傳基督敎義而設，除了把「福音」和讚美詩，廣播給敎友們收聽而外，也沒有廣吿業務。</p>
<p>就這些電台的設備說，普通都設有簡單的機器房，播音室和制音室。它們所用的發射機在二〇〇至五〇〇瓦特之間，至於唱片多少，各家懸殊很大，不過隨時可以向各唱片公司租用。</p>
<p>在節目方面，每月調換一决，各家大同小異。遊藝廣吿節目，分爲彈詞·評語·平劇·話劇·滬劇·越劇·自由彈唱·歌唱·滑稽·故事及某他種類。敎育節目如亞美麟記之無綫電學術，元昌鶴鳴之法律，中國文化之科學等講座，因是義務廣播，所以僅佔全日節目的百分之十五到二十。據該同業公會負責人說，常常接到聽者來信，要求增加敎育節目，這是一個好現象。在上述的遊藝節目中，文濱·中藝兩劇團的滬劇，丹桂·傅全香兩劇團的越劇，周柏椿和姚慕雙的滑稽等，都擁有大量的聽衆，因此它們的價格每月多在兩百萬元左右。如是主持人親自廣播或加特別節目，則要另加四五十萬元不等。平劇和歌唱則居次。各家在星期天，都有特別節目。</p>
<p>電台電費價格，均以一月爲計算單位，悉照公會決定，每四十分鐘稱爲一擋，（自下月一日起改爲三十分鐘一擋）下午八點四十分至十點的兩擋最貴，爲八十五萬元。五點二十分至八點四十分間，每擋八十萬元。上午十一點二十分至下午五點二十分間，，每擋六十五萬。其餘各擋都是四十萬元，每日自上午七時起至下午十二時止。此外尙有小報吿，每日報吿三次，爲十五萬元，全日報吿者爲五十萬元。各家收入，除開支捐稅外，每月平均在五百萬元左右。外面傳說電台廣吿也有黑市，公會方面解釋，這是極少有的。不過因爲轉播各劇院的節目，需要裝置機器和額外的管理費用，或者難免加在客家的負担上。</p>
<p>値得一提的，是各家都有一個或兩個女播音員，她們的待遇不高，可是大多對事業有興趣，爲女子職業打開了一條新路。</p>
<p>在公營電台中，以「上海」規模爲最大，在組織，設備和節目等方面，堪稱全國第一。全台戰工一百多人，傳音科尙有外籍職員十餘人。該合現有短波機一座，波長廿五公尺，專對國外播送新聞，中波機三座，採用九〇〇、八〇〇及七四〇三個K.C.，除經常播送新聞，時評，文藝，教育，各界服務等節目外，並兼營廣吿。自蘇聯，大美等電台封閉後，外商的廣吿都移到上海電台來了。它的音樂節目，特別聘請專家整理與安排，以作曲家爲一單元，每晚大抵播送一個　元的作品。</p>
<p>上海電台最近爲擴充業務，已購定虬江碼頭附近空地二百餘畝，預備建造一個强有力的新電台，今年年內便可開始擴音。</p>
<p>春天是廣播的季節，但願市面能够一天天的好轉，讓廣播小姐的溫和語調，播送到每一個人的心中。</p>

<h3>籃球聯賽劍拔弩張　汕隊苦戰勝巨人　廿八比廿五差三分擊敗勁敵六戰六勝近千觀衆皆大歡喜</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕海陸青昨已正式致函二　繁球聯賽委會，退出比賽，理由因海軍赴青島代表除哥倫布中選八人外，海陸青亦有二人代表，且日來與各隊劇戰，受傷球員頗多，該會已准如所請，因此所有該隊成績，全部取消不計，巨人隊漁翁得利，大佔便宜，該隊在賽前方獲消息，喜出望外。</p>
<p>昨晚甲組汕隊廿八比廿五偉勝巨人，六戰六勝保持常勝地位，觀衆近千，莫不喜形於色。甲二組甲勝華陽四十一比廿九，汕隊動作，有時似嫌過火。比賽詳情如下：</p>
<p>甲申勝華陽</p>
<p>華洋對甲中係甲二組比賽，上半時甲申較活躍，胖子們（華洋）落後四分，爲二十比十六。休息再戰，華陽孫銘新陳兆庭連中兩球，頓成二十平手，局勢一變，須臾復以廿四比廿三超出，甲申不敢放鬆，夏澤人引師進攻，果然三軍用命，少頃反以三十一比廿五反再領前，胖子軍昨晚祗到五人，四十五分鐘之奔波，俱有力不從心之嘆，三十一比二十五，甲申陶塋石四次畢業，顏師魯庖代，四十一比廿九終塲，甲申勝。</p>

<p>汕隊勝巨人</p>
<p>陳淸江左邊突入，蹤身投中，此球淸脆，浮尼克投桃招李，强社萊犯規淸江一分，N沙司金再犯規，紀南康兩罰未獲，淸江戰成五比二，巨人叫休，何立德亦忙裏偸閒，命中一球（七比二），陶勃令基罰中，沙司金籃下得手，陳再包辦，立德繼續立功至十一比五，蔡演雄加一球已成十三比六，巨人拼命反攻，頗少見效，上半時汕隊十八比十佔先，觀衆興高采烈。</p>
<p>巨人因未知此賽之有關錦標（海陸靑退出），健將谷佛仍未邀集，草率從事，下半時耶龍與陶令基俄增三分，汕隊暫停，十九比十三，林維聰替出紀南康，陶再中十九比十五，汕隊恐慌，再行停戰，浮尼克遠投（二十—十七），林維聰瞬息建二功，廿四比十八「猴子』陶勃令基與耶龍獲中，時存四分鐘，僅相差一分（廿四—廿三），蔡何各罰中，耶龍一怪球，依然差一分，林傳蔡遠中，此際汕隊三决罰球二次自願放棄，中塲發球，存三十五秒時，蔡畢業，陶十秒鐘後亦畢業，無獨有偶，廿八比廿五，汕隊獲勝，頗爲吃力。</p>

<h3>鄂足籃球隊　將訪京滬</h3>
<p>〔本報漢口航訊〕鄂省足籃球代表隊，於華中球賽篷得雙料錦標後，自信心爲之大增，一般認爲前此「虹翔」「征輪」兩隊來漢時，武漢球隊，尙凌亂不振，不堪强敵一擊，此次在華中一露頭角，固由於湘豫贑三隊實力較遜，要亦半年來鄂省球藝進步所致，故此間體育界，會建議將此兩代表隊略加調整，準備訪問京滬蘇抗各地，以作進一步觀摩。聞此項擬議，漸臻具體化，一俟旅費　齊後，即可定期出發。</p>
<h3>籃邊散記</h3>
<p>昨夕籃球聯賽，汕隊保持常勝，羸巨人三分。</p>
<p>巨人已敗國决，意興蘭珊，健將谷佛昨賽未出塲，開賽時始悉海陸靑棄權兩次，照章取消資格，已往戰績不計，如此，巨人祗負於華聯一决，錦標仍有一綫希望，全隊存心一拼，戰情遂形緊湊。</p>
<p>汕隊近况甚佳，昨晚致勝主因，在始終謹愼，珍惜獲球權，絕少浪擲，雖受盡威脅，卒能保有勝利。上牛時陳淸江，何立德活躍，因以十八比十佔先四球之多，下半時，陳被N沙司　緊守，何亦受制於浮尼克，耶龍更有超過本人水準之表演，汕隊遂陷入苦鬥。</p>
<p>一九比十三時，林維　見勢不佳，入替紀南康，五次投籃射</p>
<p>巨人會兩度迫成二十四比二十三，二十六比二十五之接近局面，演雄一擲，奠定勝利。</p>
<p>倘谷佛臨塲，形勢當有利於巨人，戰局必更爲精彩。</p>
<p>蔡演雄爲汕隊功臣，巨人除强杜萊外，餘均出色，耶龍之射，陶勃林基之鑽刦，予汕隊莫大威脅。（昌年）</p>

<h3>國營事業發歸民營計劃委員　昨日舉行二次會議　通過出售辦法草案十餘條由翁副院長携京呈請核定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國　生產事業發歸民營之計劃委員會，於昨日下午四時許，在本市外　中國銀行大厦，舉行第二次會議。行政院副院長文　，親有出席主持。到王　五，張　　，劉攻芸，李馥蓀，陳光　，秦澗卿，東　　，楊　仁，徐　　，胡筠秋等。會議迄六時許始　。　即席通過國營生產事業出售辦法草案十餘條。該辦法草案，對出售步驟，方式，時期，及申購手續，條件等，均有詳盡之規定。昨日會議席上，曾就各項條文，分別　取各出席人士意見。摘錄成案，由翁副院長於今日携京，送呈行政院核議，俾作最後之決定。</p>
<p>又據翁副院長於會後語記者：本會自上月廿二日一度在滬召開會議後，復曾在京會　開係方面，數度洽商此事，獲得若干意見。本次會議性質，仍着重意見之交換，　便　　後送呈行政院通過。至發歸民營方式，刻以整個辦法，尙未定案，事前未便透露。惟終以能直接售予民間經營爲原則。渠信整個辦法確定後，不出一月之期。即可付諸實施云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據消息靈通方面談稱：國營生產事業發歸民營辦法，大致對小型生產事業，將採取標售方式。大型生產事業，將視其事業之性質，分成若干有系統有關聯性之學位，然後以發行股票之方式，分期分批讓渡予民間投資經營。各事業之估價問題，容有困難之處。惟因當初接收時，莫不均有接收之估價清單，亦足資爲估價時之參考。</p>
<h3>國家行局　推進存款業務　四聯總處制定綱要</h3>
<p>四聯總處以戰前各行局存款業務，向稱發達，戰時因受物價高漲，及市塲高利影響，部份存款，逐漸脫離銀行。復員以還，此種現象仍未消除，特訂定加强推進各行局存款業務綱要七項，令飭各分支處辦理，茲將內容探誌如次：</p>
<p>（一）參酌各地市塲情形，由當地分支處商議調整存款利率標準，當地各行局應一致辦理。（二）農民銀行及合作金庫，應普遍推進農村儲蓄。（三）郵政儲金業務，普及內地，返應全面策動，誘導收存，並由中央銀行優給轉存利率。　舉辦各種信託，及特種儲蓄存款，以啓發存戶興趣。（如團體分紅存款等）（五）簡化存款支款手續，並准隨時以定期存單作押，取息不得高於存息百分之三十。對於存戶調匯款項，並予優先辦理。（六）由財政部督導商業行莊，擴大吸收存款，幷准以最優惠之利息，轉存中央銀行。（七）商業行莊停業倒閉時，應由財政部限令於最短期內，淸償各項存款，以保障存戶利益，提高社會對銀行之信心。</p>
<p>（又訊）國家行局推進存款業務綱要頒發後，聯合徵信所記者特趨訪四聯總處負責人，詢以銀行存款業務情形，及綱要實施後之展望，承吿行局存款有三項顯著之特徵：（一）活期存款之比例增多，定期存款之比例减少。（二）機關存款之比例增多，工商個人存款之比例减少。（三）存款表面之數字增多，存款之實際幣値减少。</p>
<p>本綱要規定各項，如調整存款利率，加緊吸收儲蓄，簡便存款支取，保障存戶利益，均爲針對時弊之對策，政府已從事於節省開支，增裕收人，以謀穩定幣値。最近取締黃金買賣，禁止外幣流通，管制必需品價格，嚴禁囤積居奇。今後游資之出路趨狹，可能逐漸回籠，存入銀行。國家行局推行政府政策，辦理生產事業貸款，正宜趁此時機，積極推進存款業務，加緊吸收游資，以收縮之通貨，用之於協助生產，誠一舉兩得云。</p>
<h3>台灣煉糖廠　擬分單位出售</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：台灣糖業公司，目前估値的爲台幣三百億元。該公司共有煉糖廠卅六單位。關係方面表示，以目前高利貸盛行時期，以發行股票方式發歸民營，恐不能推行盡利。不如將所屬煉糖廠，分單位出售，由民間投資經營。據悉；各煉糖廠每單位每日榨糖量，自一千噸至三千六百噸不定。每單位之估値，的自美金二百萬元起，至三百萬元止。如能分單位出售，則廠與廠之間，必有競爭性，從而亦能提高各糖廠之生產效率云。</p>
<h3>國行提高存息尙待審愼考慮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕金融界某要員表示：團家銀行提高利率之計劃，財部尙在　愼研究之中，實施尙有待。據聞財部高級人員中，不乏反對此辦法者，其主要理由有三：（一）國行利率如提高，則市塲暗息可能亦水漲船高，其結果將刺激物價，並壓迫正當之工商業。同時以目前物價之趨勢而言，欲以提高利率而吸收大量游資，事實上亦頗有困難。（二）國行吸收存款後，原則上將以低利貸出。在此情形之內，可能有不肖商人，利用各種辦法，將低利借進之款以高利存入國行，或以高息流入黑市，此種流弊，防不勝防。（三）國行如以高利吸收存款，以低利放出，其不足之教，勢必甚巨，如由國庫補貼，勢必擴大財政赤字，加速通貨之發行，與穩定整個經濟之宗旨，大相逕庭。</p>
<h3>外滙調整後　出口物資動態</h3>
<p>— 章柏庵</p>
<p>入春以還，滬市出口物資，先之以補貼政策之振　，繼之以外匯調整之刺激，各項出口貨品，莫不齊步飛颺，創勝利以來之大波動。茲將各商品之動態，分述於下：</p>
<p>（一）桐油　桐油最近價格與上年年底比較，計上漲達百分之二九〇，若以紐約之近價，每磅三角七分半美金計算，則紐約交貨價爲折合國幣五十萬零四千元。歐洲英屬各地，每噸價格，自二百二十至二百四十五英磅，折合國幣價最高爲五十萬元，最低爲四十四萬元，除運費，保險，稅繳外，國內價過高，多已無法出口。且目前國內各產區，存底極薄，新油開榨，預計的在本月底可以開始，如新貨上市，內價或可减低。</p>
<p>（二）猪鬃　猪鬃上漲程度，亦復甚熾，上海一七號黑猪鬃每箱一三三磅由一〇二萬漲至三百萬元，計增加百分之二九四。漢口一七號黑猪鬃由一四〇萬漲至五五〇萬元，計上漲百分之三九二。重慶二七號黑猪　，由一三〇萬漲三九〇萬元，計上漲達百分之三〇〇。現以紐約政府方面拋售戰前存業，故除滬　獨俏外。它如川漢，天津等鬃，均甚軟弱。紐約市價滬　爲每磅美金二元一角折合國幣爲三三五萬元，川鬃每磅爲二元六角折合國幣爲四一五萬元。漢口　由四元二角跌至三元五角，折合國幣爲五七八萬元。依照現價，亦已碰頂，上年猪　出口數量爲九·〇〇〇·〇〇〇磅，本年以外匯調整後，激漲三倍，故輸出可望增加。</p>
<p>（三）茶葉　外銷茶葉，久以外價之過低而礙於出口，外匯調整後，上漲程度僅百分之一七〇，不如其他之甚。現當局對華茶出口，已頻加注意，本年度如獲豐收，輸出當可增加，查上年度茶之輸出量爲七·五〇〇·〇〇〇磅，僅及戰前十分之一。</p>
<p>（四）腸衣　腸衣本年度之輸出額，據業中人云：可達八千桶，總値可得五千二百萬　金，其升　率爲百分之六五四，超勝任何出口物資之比率，現國外紐約市價，每副由美金六角二分跌至五角二分，買戶觀望不前，尙有下跌勢，是以光騰之折合國幣每桶爲七百八十萬元，除去運費及其他費用，的一百萬元，共爲六百入十萬元。但滬市陽衣之製造成本須七百六十萬元，現價七百廿萬元，已無異折本，故出口運　，尙有待於生產成本之低廉，方可承做。</p>
<p>（五）毛羽　毛羽上漲率，亦達百分之二二〇至二八五，近來到銷兩旺，洋商旣頻加靑睞，外　來貨，復　繹而至，內價尙低外價不弱，頗有盛極一時之感。</p>
<p>（六）生絲　生絲之上漲率，可稱出口貨最低之一種，最高漲率，亦不過百分之一七〇，最近市况故款，執貨者紛紛拋售，洋行　足不前。英商怡和，瑞商　納洋行，殺價頗烈，僅印商海屋洋行仍有吸意，故照市尙難有好面可看。</p>
<p>（其他）　他如凍蛋，蛋黃等，最近出口亦呈復活，五　子尙不能出口，花邊，　　品，洋枕，草帽，鈕扣等，以市價　漲，國外價格頻頻報挫，輸出頗受影響。</p>
<h3>統稅印花稅調整以後　麵粉廠商提出要求　（一）取消限價恢復自由買賣（二）每包本粉另加八一九元</h3>
<p>第四區麵粉工業同業公會，以財部對麵粉提高稅收事，定今日呈報吳市長調整價格，並請財部維持原稅率，據福新麵粉廠負責人曹啓東氏語記者，最近接到財政部直接稅局來文，各廠對印花稅一項，今後須以千分之三稅率計算，同時貨物稅局來文，對麵粉統稅自十日起改征每包一千元，較前增加七百元，而自本月三日至九日間，一週內之統稅差額，亦須追繳，以往在市府召開麵粉配售會議時，吳市長允各廠爲配售民生必需品，印花稅一律每包二十元，不計配價多寡，目前本粉廠盤配價四萬五千元，本週內定配本粉印花稅將較前二十元多一一五元一包，本粉每包成本在五二五〇〇至五五〇〇〇元之間，中信局配出十萬包，洋粉每包三萬元，但廠方須墊出二十萬包本粉，政府雖有貼補，然差額僅能相抵，實無盈餘可言，且成本一項，早經吳市長認係最低限價，今政府爲平衡收支，由財政部增加稅收，是則政府之稅收並非在廠方之利潤上稽征，而直接將其賣產轉入國庫，故廠方要求二點，（一）在現有限價內，追加之稅額由消費者負担，每包本粉另加八一五元，（二）如麵粉能取消限價制，恢復自由賣買，則政府之加征稅率，廠方自將運守，繼稱最近中信局及中糧公司二機構，向自由市塲拋出鉅額利浪粉，而各民營麵粉廠則在政府限價之政策下，爲國計民生，苦度艱難之歲月云。</p>
<h3>方糖候船運滬</h3>
<p>台糖公司鑒於方糖需要孔股，爲適應市面起見，前由台省總公司遷揀高等原料，加工製造雪白方糖一種，現已大批製就，候船運滬，第一批的計一千餘箱，每箱裝廿五磅，每務售價的計國幣三千元。又悉上次台省動亂，台糖總公司連同台中之虎尾，台南麻豆，新營及高雄之　東等各公司所屬員工一萬七千餘，暨機器等全部無恙，食糖供應毫無問題云。</p>
<h3>上海鋼鐵公司擬就生產計劃</h3>
<p>官商合辦之上海鋼鐵公司，自上月下旬成立後，頃已擬就生產計劃，該公司之浦東熔鐵爐，吳淞煉鋼爐，及黃興路軋鋼機三廠基，可望於五月間開工，煉鋼爐每日產鋼六百七十噸，軋鋼機每日軋鋼二百噸，價値四十億元，　　　工後，本市每月　　之　鐵約一千五百餘噸，以前因無法利用而讓赴日本者，可全由該廠回　，中信馬原有接收敵　之廢鐵四千至五千噸，亦將爲該　鍊鑄，全廠三千匹馬力之機　，業經公用局用常審核委員會通過接電，　　　工很，即將成滬股後上海唯一大規模之鍊　廠，其　品事供　器營造二業運用。</p>
<h3>統丙等三種公債　下月十日抽籤</h3>
<p>財政部二十五年統一公債丙種債票，第廿三次還本抽籤，共三十六支，計法幣一千二百六十萬元。廿七年國防公債，第十六决還本抽籤，共十支，計國幣五十萬元。三十年建設公債第三期債票，第七次抽籤，共五支，計法幣二百萬元。以上三種債票，業定下月十日，在該部滬處舉行抽籤云。</p>
<h3>銀樓可能復業配金仍未獲准</h3>
<p>本市銀樓業自奉令停業，迄今月餘。經該業一再呼籲，據悉財部已允復業，並定後（十九）日公佈銀樓業營業條例。聞對黃金交易，或將准許自由買賣，惟中央銀行則不再配售。故銀樓業聞訊後，仍極恐慌，已推派代表姚桂卿於昨日上午晋京。勞方代表亦定今日啓程赴京，同向三中全會請願，要求恢復配給。</p>
<h3>進出口業代表今向央行請願</h3>
<p>進出口業同業公會，原定上星期日向中央銀行總裁張嘉璈請願，嗣因若干意見未曾商妥，且悉張總裁因公晋京，故決改於今日推派代表前往請願，要求改善進出口結匯及输入辦法云。</p>
<h3>橡膠進口限額太少　廠商要求酌量放寬　並將生橡膠與製品劃分</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市樣膠業同業公會於週前呈文輸管會，要求即按實際需要，重訂生橡膠輸入限額；及將生橡膠與製品劃分，並禁止舊胎廢料等進口，理由爲經實地之調查，僅上海一地之橡膠工廠，每月即需生橡膠一千七百三十九噸半，而輸管會所公布之二三四月橡膠及製品之輸入限額，僅有美金一百十萬元，此數僅够上海一地一個月之用！而上海以外各地需用生橡膠，合計最少與上海相等，即使限額全爲生橡膠，全國每月即共需二百萬美元。乃此戔戔美金一百十萬元，需分三個月之用，更需分去製成品一部份，故與實際需要，竟成一與十之比。在此情形之下，橡膠工業維持爲難，故甚盼輸管會能卙酌實情，放寬限額。又在橡膠工業中所需之化學品，例如鋅　粉及立德粉等，亦希望政府能有適當之配給。據該業公會理事長洪念祖吿記者：去年橡膠業之尙稱景氣，有其特殊之理由，此種繁榮並不能持久，外界將橡膠業與棉紡業相比，乃由不明實情所致。去年橡膠業熱鬧之原因有三：（一）去年之原斜供應，有敵產配售，價格每磅始終在每磅五百元至一千元之間，易言之，即原料價格相當穩定；（二）去年一年中外貨之傾銷，不如想像之烈；（三）抗戰前國內橡膠廠大多數停工，戰後民間亟須補充，需要量較大。有以上三項原因，兼以膠製品價格之上揚，落於一般物價之後，民間感覺便宣，樂於購買，造成去年之景氣。今年則各項有利因索，巳均不存在矣。</p>
<h3>黃狼皮俏升　皮革榮辱互見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨市黃狼皮忽又悄升，其他　皮，白狗皮，豹皮等，亦一致挺升。據悉：某外商對各皮輸往歐洲，利潤頗佳，恰値近日市價下跌之時，逢低扒吸。第以近來產地甚少還滬，市貨亦日見稀疏，致行市反見挺秀。並聞紐約方面，運到黃狼皮甚多，買主殺價甚烈，皮革市塲生黃牛皮，底皮等，連日疲落，昨市齊步轉堅。各牌紋皮，則每况愈下，價再下游。</p>
<h3>金山枝平穩</h3>
<p>金山枝昨開百數箱，貨尙佳，較高者爲六十六萬元，次之四十二萬六千元，市象平平。</p>
<h3>介紹　交易所上市股票廠商槪覽</h3>
<p>聯合微信所調查組織印之上海市證券交易所上市股票廠商概覽，業已出版。內容包括紡織，內衣，絲織，化工，百貨，文化，地產等業共七類，計廿六單位。全書共七十餘頁。每册定價五千元，總經售爲正文書局。</p>

<h3>海外僑胞過港　登陸時遭人敲詐入國門美鈔盡失</h3>
<p>— 香港十日航訊　本報特約記者子健</p>
<p>自去年下半年起，每月平均有兩三艘載運華僑返國的美國船隻抵港，小的載運二三百人，大的載運千人，故每月華僑抵港人數，平均總在千人以上。華僑抵達香港首先遭遇行李搬運的苛索或敲詐，甚至失竊和被搶。每　較大的船隻抵港，如「美琪將軍」號，「戈登將軍」號等，報上便有歸國華僑的投函，訴說登岸途中被人敲詐或行李失竊的痛苦。有少數人畢生在海外胼手胝足的所得，當返抵國門的時候，達然喪失！這眞是人間不忍想像的慘事之一！</p>
<p>香港戰後頒佈了一條碼頭管制條例，據稱目的在防止碼頭堆棧和船上的失竊，而一般親友接船和旅運社接客的利便，因此剝奪殆盡。不管船上的乘客是什麼人，他的親友祗能在越出視綫範圍的碼頭鐵門外等候。當敎皇駐華公使南巡來港的一天，聽說港督派了他的副官去迎迓，那位副官自以為是特殊人物，事前未有携帶什麽通行證之類的文件，碼頭的守衛便給他擋駕。結果，那位副官和其他的神父們，祗好在鐵門外迎迓敎廷公使，我們的歸國僑胞的親友們，更不用說了！</p>
<p>行李失竊僑胞呌苦</p>
<p>在如此嚴密的管制下，那末光虫船上送入堆棧，翌日憑船票去領回的歸國僑胞的大件行李，理應不會有失竊或失踪的事；但事實適得其反。每艘船隻抵港，行李失竊的總有百數十件。旅客的行李被送入推棧裏，或東廂或西廂，或上層或下層，由旅客自己認尋。旅客在堆棧裏跑上跑下，翻箱倒篋，十件行李找回八件，若果那兩件不是重要的，有的便寗願把牠犧牲，因為他們在堆棧裏打轉半天，委實己再沒有氣力了！這個磨折，不祗歸國僑胞，即虫滬乘搭一條停靠香港對岸九龍倉碼頭的大洋船來港的旅客，也同樣接受這樣一段難以忘却經歷的，想必大有人在。</p>
<p>苦力索費槪需美鈔</p>
<p>旅客自携小行李登岸，則碼頭苦力爭搶生意，原定每件五角的，却索價三元至五元。從船上搬至碼頭，從碼頭搬至海關檢查所，從海關檢查所搬至碼頭鐵門外，三個階段分三種不同的苦力搬運，索三决價錢，但這三段路合計，走起來不及三分鐘！這短短的距離何以必須劃分三批苦力搬運，眞是「天曉得」。苦力知道旅客是歸國僑胞則非美鈔不要，如不照給，則三五成羣把你包圍起來，聲勢汹汹，吃虧的當然是「舉目無親」的人們！</p>
<p>無妄之災代鳴不平</p>
<p>歸僑不遠萬哩返抵香港，經歷上述種種磨折，是否就算安抵彼岸，阿彌陀佛，今後半世餘生，得與家人在祖國安居樂業呢？不！不！不！他們命該受苦，在海外給人家奚落不算，在香港給人敲詐不算，當他搭火車進入祖國，月台外的海關人員最近還要把他們歷年辛苦所得的美鈔扣去，理由是政府明令不許携帶超過美金百元以上的外幣入口！政府這個法令是為了對付不法的商人，但平日對國家作極大貢獻的海外華僑，却因此而遭了「無妄之災」了！假如你是海外歸僑，常你歷盡種種苦難而興高彩烈踏進國門的時候，你以血汗換來的金錢，竟在這一剎那給人扣去，你可怎麽辦！你可怎麼辦！</p>
<p>政府明令規定，僑委會亦等因奉此發出快郵代電通吿僑團：不可携帶外幣進口。那麼，歸僑們「誠惶誠恐」遵照携帶國幣，但國幣又不得超過五十萬元。百元美鈔和五十萬國幣，可有什麽用？你也許會怪責記者太愚昧了，歸僑的錢，難道不可以「匯返」祖國嗎？好了，假如一個歸僑，手裏共有美鈔五千元，匯返祖國所得國幣六千萬元。這五千萬元，再過半年，可値回多少？再過一年可値回多少？假如你手上有美鈔，你為什麼不把牠全數兌換國幣？够了，記者不是歸僑，不過目覩歸僑的種種苦難，人非木石，能不代作幾句不平鳴嗎？</p>
<p>在港住下另作打算</p>
<p>事實如此，歸僑不能回到祖國當俄殍，他們想了又想，便大家不的而同，先在香港住下來再作打算。目前不便回鄕，儘可呌家人來港團叙。橫堅自己袋裏有錢，如果財產有保障，則不愁活不下去。於是歸僑原本打算在祖國自建一間房屋的，那麽那間房屋祗好建於香港。歸僑原本打算在　國開辦一個工廠或商行的，那麽那間工廠或商行不辦則己，要辦便祗有在香港辦！要言之，歸僑帶回來的資本，原本可以作為滋潤貧乏的祖國的甘露的，而今却替人家繁榮這個「外强中乾」的殖民地！海外歸僑每月平均以千計，則半年來已有六千人。而每人携返美鈔或相等的財富五千元計，則至少有美鈔三千萬元。且不論今後源源歸國的！這個數字雖不為多，但亦不算「無關輕重」的少。我們一面焦頭爛額的獎勵出口，吸引外匯，一面作富家子弟的氣派，看不起歸僑寸滴積成的財寳，眞的如此嗎？記者不相信，一萬個不相信，但不相信却不能改變鐵一般的事實。所以，為了撫慰歸僑，為了充實國家財富，深望有關當局能够替歸僑想想辦法，包括登陸的　導，現金的處理等等，這些事情縱使沒有「折枝」那麼容易，可沒有「移山」那麼困難，似應馬上妥籌一個完滿的辦法。往者已矣，來者可追，繁榮人家的殖民地尙屬事小，而失去海外僑胞對祖國的懷戀事大，似不得不請求審愼辦理。</p>
<h3>杭州香汎農胞淚</h3>
<p>— 十二日杭州訊本報特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>太陽帶來了溫暖，料峭的春寒被熟烘烘的風吹走了。杭州靈峯的梅，已盛裝含笑，孤山的梅已滿滿地開着，超山的梅花怒放，他們都爭姸賣弄。由西子湖濱，循着聖塘路到裏湖，漫步在靜江路上，「省廬」牆裏的一支紅梅一支白梅，她們已跳出牆外，滿枝滿枝地堆滿着花，一股股芬芳的香味，撩起人們無比的春愁。那白堤蘇堤上的老柳，已抽出了嫩綠的枝條，輕輕地與野草細語。在綠色的廣野裏，露出了一角角黃色的牆瓦，這是佛地，他們也整理一新，讓千萬善男信女去膜拜信奉。</p>
<p>腳腫鞋從拖　朝山進香</p>
<p>杭州的香汎隨春的蒞臨以俱來，鄉下農胞來進香的要比京滬各大都會來遊春的多，這許多農胞，有來自衢屬，嚴屬，紹屬，嘉屬的，隔省約有蘇屬，松屬，太屬等。這幾天來，在杭州市上，可以得見成羣結隊的農胞，他們穿着藍，靑，灰各色不同的短襖，登着布鞋，女的梳光了有髮髻的頭，有的穿着八幅紅裙，插着紅紙做成的花。他們都　了黃布袋，袋上印着「朝山進香」與「天竺進香」等字樣。</p>
<p>這許多進香的農胞，有的是乘民船來的，有的還是步行的，在路上，一點葷都不吃，一到杭州，最重要的是打聽燒香的路徑。他們也是有組織的，有一個人是「香頭」，由他指揮和設計一切。每一個到杭州來燒香的人大概要出一祖米的光景，到了杭州後其他的化費當各自理楚。貧窮的農戶，只怪自己的為何不燒香，所以雖在香也燒不起之下，還得積蓄二三年，也來燒一回香。在杭州農胞們到各寺廟去燒香，大半都是步行的。當我們在白堤上漫步時，看見有幾個女香客，已經脚都走肺了，鞋子都拖曳着了。我們還看見有八九個男香客，用銅鈎紮在他的臂膀肉裏，下面用銅絲吊着一隻足足有七七八斤重的錫香爐，也這樣地步行前去。據說他們這種舉動，是「還願」與「許願」。</p>
<p>農胞的命運　任佛支配</p>
<p>在這春已來臨，正是耕種的時節，他們怎有閒暇來燒香呢？原來他們的來燒香，也是像耶穌天主敎在每一事前的禱吿一樣，表示是一種預祝的意思，他們企求佛賜予他們「　花茂盛」，「五榖豐登」，甚至繭價賣得起，米價也能賣得起，還得債後尙可為小狗小毛多添幾件衣衫。當然他們昧於如何使蠶養好，米糧種好的道理，他們只知道一切都是佛賜予的。沒有佛，一切都沒有了。甚至只知道自己的命運都是佛所支配的，命途，乖謬，這是前生注定的。他們有什麼寃屈，有什麽被惡覇所壓迫時，也只有期諸於佛的解救。因為「衙門深似海」，「官官相護」的一貫習慣下，他們以「佛」的假想來作為自己心靈上的慰藉。</p>
<p>今天，世界已進步到原子的時代，而我們佔大多數人民的農胞還是這樣地可憐，這到底是誰的責任？像這樣的進香，我們在兒時已是習見了，那知現在還是如此這般的進香着。我們詫異很多人高　閱論着農村經濟和改善晟村，而農村因何還是這般的沒有進步？我們更詫異推　蠶桑和改進農村合作運動的先生們，何以他們科學而合理的力量，擊不破農胞對於「佛賜予」的觀念？</p>
<p>大和尙化緣　慷慨解囊</p>
<p>當他們到寺廟去燒香時，大和尙　出　簿，請他們寫一點，他們當然也慷慨捐助，雖然是五千一萬元，但這些錢上無不有他們的點點汗珠與絲絲血　。</p>
<p>這幾天，天竺山和城隍山上的香火最為鼎盛，其他的寺廟當然也不差，黃包車，三輪車的生意並不好，甚至划子也不見得生意興隆。據有經騐的划子說：「他們比較有錢的當然　三輪車，其次是集體乘划子，乘划子大多順這三　印月到凈慈寺燒香去，旁的地方再也不會去的，在這裏我們也廉不了幾個錢。」由這些話裏，我們知道忠實可愛而又可憐的農胞，他們可不是「借佛燒香」呢！</p>
<p>杭州市在道初期香汛中，店舖中沾到光的恐怕要算胡慶餘堂藥舖了，農胞們期求了佛賜福後，也想盡一點人事。在胡慶餘藥舖裏生意最好的莫如痧藥和膏藥，其次才是藥酒，再其次才是人參再造丸或是人參，阿膠之類，因為痧藥可以治內，膏藥可以治外，內外兼治，也可算是盡了人事了。唉！這千萬廣大的農胞，竟在和病魔盲目的搏鬥！</p>
<p>願與佛競賽　改善農村</p>
<p>據說，農村中的香客，絡繹不斷上杭州來燒香的，從現在這時候開始，一直要到舊曆四月初六為止。這時來燒香的，全為了蠶，他們回去後，調旁的人來燒，等到「蠶開門」（即蠶作繭售脫後）再來還「願心」。</p>
<p>我們當然不會反對他們上杭州來燒香，而是香燒了後，菩薩到底給他們點什麽？同時，我們的地方政府到底應該給他們點什麼？如果地方政府給他們的利益使他們能相信了，那麽他們到杭州來也可以玩逛玩逛，不致於匆匆的來去，所以我們希望地方政府能同菩薩比賽一下子。</p>

<h3>論通貨管理並建議發行　「物價指數國庫劵」（上）</h3>
<p>— 李崇淮</p>
<p>「我國經濟已呈百孔千　，水深火熱之勢，僅是批評與責備，於事實何補？區區之見，就正於海內　達，聊作拋磚引玉，共對當前局勢作一有建設性之建議耳。」——筆者</p>
<p>一　「經濟緊急措施方案」之公佈</p>
<p>繼二月十日左右黃金物價狂瀾之後，政府於二月十六日公佈「經濟緊急措施方案」，其中包括禁止黃金買　與外幣流通，厲行物價管制，統籌民用必需品的供給，嚴格管理生產，發展輸出貿易及力求預算平衡等等。就該方案的文字言，似對經濟全局已面面顧到，但一細加檢討，即深感隱憂四伏，前途危機重重，正方興未艾。在該辦法公佈後數日中，或可穩定金融物價於一時，因其對於驚濤駭浪的社會尙不失為一副安定劑，但不久的將來，物價恐仍繼漲，對於整個經濟恐慌，未必有極大的補益。</p>
<p>筆者認為該方案的缺陷，在於對通貨仍不能作有效的管理，因此物價深恐未必即能穩定。</p>
<p>二　當前經濟問題之　結</p>
<p>在討論正文之先，姑就我國當前經濟作一簡約的分析。我國經過八年抗戰及年餘的內亂，政府戰費支出浩大，生產基礎摧殘殆盡。政府支出通常由租稅，國營事業收入，公債及發行通貨來彌補。租稅是建築在生產繁榮的基礎上，生產蕭條，市面空虛，自不能依賴租稅作大宗的收入。目前國營事業尙在幼稚草創期中，資本支出實多於收益。在物價飛漲，通貨在速貶値過程中，以通常的手段來發行公債殆不可能。因此唯有訴諸發行通貨一途。通貨膨脹，不一定是壞事；通貨膨脹時，若物資能相對的增加，則物價不一定能上漲。有計劃的慢性通貨膨脹，也許可以促成工商繁榮，减少失業；但相反的，若通貨膨脹，而物資益形减少，其膨脹且又是漫無計劃而又跳躍式的話，則成為惡性通貨膨脹，其結果，將使生產與貿易脫節，而促成物價的瘋在上漲。惡性通貨膨脹最顯著的產物，便是拆息高懸，因為通貨增加（假設通貨流通速度及使用習慣不變），物資缺乏，則物價扶搖而上，因此商業利潤特別厚，而使短期借貸利息不正常的增高，致人民不願作長期而多風險的投資，於是生產事業不易獲得資本，難以添置及改換機器設備以增產。通貨繼續發行而生產不易增加，則物價又必高漲；物價高漲，則政府又必增加通貨發行。這種惡性循環，若無適當辦法遏止，勢將漫無止境的。</p>
<p>三　通貨管理是解決當前經濟問題的重心</p>
<p>在前述的經濟狀態中，有三種關鍵因素；一為通貨數量，一為利息，一為物資。假使通貨不繼續增發（以下均指相對的而言），則物價或不致再漲，利息可以跌落，生產可以增加。假若利息一般地低平，長期投資有利，生產可以增加，物價上漲可以减殺。假若物資供給增加，物價漲勢减緩，商業利潤看低，利息必然跌落，生產可以獲益，通貨亦可减少發行。通貨數量，利息，與物資三者，若能皆有控制，是穩定物價的上策。但利息的本身又附着於通貨數量與物價相互的關係，因此，最有效的辦法，是從管理通貨與增加物資二者着手。</p>
<p>但此二者亦有輕重主從之分。增加物資方法有二途：一為向國外輸入，二為增加國內生產。後者須受利息及通貨膨脹的牽制，有如前述，運輸機構不靈，貨物不暢其流，亦為阻碍生產之因，均非短期可以奏效。前者需要大量的外匯以及國外友情的捐助。已往我國維持低率外匯，即係鼓勵輸入之意，惟以有限的外匯資源，供給無限的需要，自難維持長久，依靠外國友情的捐助，救濟物資就是一例，但恐維持不久。「經濟緊急措施方案」中，似着眼於外國實物貸款，惟對方是否願意，目前亦難有把握。即使一切如意，通貨若仍是漫無管理的發行，或物資增加的速度還不若通貨增加的速度，則物價仍將上漲不已。因此，我們自身較能有把握管理的，就是通貨的數量。通貨數量是經濟體系中最主要的一環，其本身具有支配其他因素的力量，忽此就彼，任何其他的措施皆將失敗。</p>
<p>四　通貨管理之道在於為社會的剩餘購買力（即游資）找出路</p>
<p>筆者所謂通貨管理，並不是絕對不增加發行，除非國內得以免除戰爭消耗，此時絕對不增加發行，是不可能的。即使國內和平統一，在生產未復，一切待興的情形下，發行仍將增加。這增加的發行原是政府無中生有的購置力。但這過份的購口力轉移到人民手上，總要有個出路才行。人民所獲購買力（指除去捐稅的收入而言）的出路，不外是消費，儲蓄，或投資（收藏為數比較少，故從略；儲蓄在某種定義上—如凱恩斯派所指—與投資相等）。戰時英美財政赤字膨脹速率之大遠勝於吾人，但其物價上漲有限，其原因固部份由於物價管制之得法，但最要者，則為人民所剩之購買力除消費外，尙有可靠的儲蓄及投資的對象，或以之投資工商事業，或以之購買政府公債，或存儲款項於銀行，而由銀行轉購政府公債，作為營遝資產。戰時此項資產的佔英美銀行流動資產60％以上。這些購置力，一方面增加生產及物資流通，同時又經過公債的橋樑入於政府手中，用為再次的支出。在我國則不然，人民所獲的購買力，除去消費外，則難有可靠的出路。我國沒有健全的資本市塲，不易引導人民投資，國家銀行儲存利息太低，不足以引導儲蓄，從而擴張生產信用，幣値跌落速度太大，公債難以發行，因此人民剩餘之購買力大多是去囤積貨物，或將銀錢存入商業行莊戚甚至地下錢莊及拆票公司等。前者增加物資之需要，促使物價上漲，後者增加投機信用的膨脹，亦為促使物價上漲之因素。因此管理通貨之運，　在如何吸收我國人民除去正常消費以外的　餘購買力、而使轉移於政府之手，這便是本文的用意所在。</p>
<p>五　黃金政策之失敗在於黃金之存量有限</p>
<p>茲就拋售黃金政策，先行略加檢討。黃金的拋售，質　之，不過是政府公債的替身而已。因為公債不易發行，政府不得不拿黃金來吸取人民的購實力。原來黃金的價値是穩定的，正合乎人民保障儲蓄價値的要求。通貨不斷膨脹，一般物價上漲，黃金價格應該高，如不高則不易吸收通貨。故金價上漲並不是其他物價上漲的原因，而是通貨膨脹的指南針。如果金價與一般物價漲率相同或漲在物價前面，表示金價吸收市塲的購買力多，無形中即可减去人民爭購物資的力量。如黃金並非漲在物價前面，則更可證明物價之漲便不是由於黃金的上漲。就吾人所知，去年一—三月間上海黃金最高價每條為一，一九四，〇〇〇元，最低價為七九五，〇〇〇元，本年一月五日—十二日上海黃金平均價每條為三，六三三，三三三元，以此與去年一月至三月間的最高價相比，不過上漲一·九倍，即與當時最低價相比，亦不過上漲四·五倍。而同期間的物價上漲情形怎樣？根據中央銀行月報所發表的上海基要商品躉售物價指數，三十五年一月間為九二，八四二·五，本年一月六日至十三日的平均數為六五四，六三三，後者比前者的高七倍。是黃金價上漲的速率還不及物價之高，足證金價與物價之漲，皆是通貨膨張的結果，而並非金價刺激了物價。</p>
<p>黃金政策的動用，足以吸收一部通貨，减緩物價上漲之勢，平心而論，我們不能一味指責其錯誤。但黃金政策終歸失敗，其原因乃由於黃金可能發揮的力量受了黃金存量的限制。當局未能顯慮及此，未免失策。二月十日前後的金潮，固然是受了舊曆年關發行大額錢票，頒佈出口津貼與增加進口稅等因素的刺激，但其基本原因恐還是黃金庫存空虛的情報漏入投機者的手中，以致紛紛搶購，高抬金價，終於逼迫政府不得不放棄黃金的拋售政策。</p>
<p>央行放棄黃金買賣政策以後的經濟，是可慮的。業已流入市塲的黃金，現在凍結着鉅大的購買力。現在市塲的黃金確實數量不得而知，就最謹愼最低的估計至少有五百萬兩，以目前央行收價計算即値法幣二萬四千億元，政府能否担負這筆支出？市塲上若增加了這筆鉅額法幣購買力其影響於物價又何加？不問可知！最穩妥的方法，似乎只有將牌價抑低，作為有名無實的收購，讓這批黃金存留在人民的荷包裏或行莊的保險箱中；此或即為目前央行的政策，然而人民心有不甘，走私之風恐難遏阻！</p>
<p>六　「經濟緊急措施方案」之檢討—尙缺乏管理通貨之工具</p>
<p>黃金公開買賣政策旣已成過去，我們再看十六日所公佈的「經濟緊急措施方案」究能有什麽功效？</p>
<p>（一）關於預算平衡者：政府欲減少不必要的支出，事實上恐不可能。即使能够减少，也很有限。試問，假若是不必要的支出，政府又何必列入預算？筆者深恐財政支出非但不能因此減少，或將更有增加。因為管理物價，統購日用品，加強租稅等，勢必又增加若干機構與開銷。增加租稅，也絕不是短期中可以奏效的事；健全的租稅，必須建築在工商繁榮的基礎上，換句話說，必須先從培植稅源著手，否則是挖肉補瘡，殺鷄求蛋，徒然减少工商業的再生產力。標售敵偽資產，可以達到部份收縮通貨及增加物資的目的，但其數量究有幾何，如何運用，都成問題。國營事業招收民股或轉售於人民，在技術上也須研討。已有收益的事業，政府未必願出讓；尚無基礎的事業，人民自亦不願投資。故欲要這些方法，以求目前的財政平衡，勢不可能。然則通貨仍增發，殆無疑問。</p>
<p>（二）關於取締投機買賣安定金融市塲者：禁止外幣流通，為了加强外匯管理，是政府早應採取的步驟。以高價收購外幣，固可减削外幣黑市，而增加外匯資源，但央行却要付出一筆收購的代價。放棄黃金政策的影響，已見前述。至於加强管制金融市塲的辦法，太着重於硬性的政治手段，其對於物價穩定有若何作用，亦堪疑問。我國銀行制度根本的缺點，便是中央銀行商業銀行與錢莊之間脫節，換句話說，整體金融市塲不是一個有機動性約有機體。中央銀行只是政府的銀行而未做到銀行的銀行，其主要原因就是缺乏一種溝通自中央銀行至各金融機關的動脈。這動脈，在英美銀行制度中，就是政府公債及有價證券。這不但是中央銀行公開市堪運用的法寳，用以脹縮信用，並且也是貼現率及準備率的相輔工具。它溝通先進國家的金融機構，成為心臟週圍的大血管，使中央銀行能自由地控制市塲信用的放縮。目前我國中央銀行雖已試做到集中存款準備，重貼現，再抵押等地步，對於放款信用的「質」的控制，也做到相當效果，但因為缺乏這種溝通整個市塲的血管，所以仍難靈活地控制金融全面。新方案中對於金融市塲硬性的控制，更增加了中央銀行，商業銀行，與錢莊間的隔膜，忽略了經濟的連鎖性，對於工商放款，限制太嚴，恐有礙於物資之流通殊鉅。物資不暢其流，各地供求自難互相調節。再說，即或金融市塲已置於嚴格管理之下，但政府增發通貨所造成的人民剩餘購買力，根本不掌握在銀行錢莊之手，故政府管理行莊，對此項剩餘購買力仍未能予以合理的控制，人民以之爭購物炎，又將奈何？</p>

<h3>龔定盦近體詩的作風（一）</h3>
<p>— 喻蘅</p>
<p>淸代有兩個奇才磊落的詩人，他們以生命之活力忠實地償付了詩的藝術價値，一個是薄命的黃仲則；一個是犯放的號定　。</p>
<p>詩到了淸代因為流俗的玩吟，和　觴於試帖詩的體制，早已失去了眞正的價値，而被一般自命為「詩人」的「文人」誤解了。他們把詩看成一種形式的文學，忽視了詩應有特殊的內容，誤解了詩的定義，無形中認為詩是無聊應酬的東西，是文學的附庸，所以詩格愈　愈下了。以當代名噪一時的王漁洋好袁枚，也不能出乎這個窠臼。尤其是袁枚，後期作品，盡以聲色犬馬和小倉山隨園為背景；以應酬朋友觴飲為題裁，簡直不成東西。然而當時他交往的都是公卿「名士」，大家都爭以詩句能經隨園詩話　譽為榮，因此，詩話完全成了一個附和阿諛的世界。這種無是非曲直的風氣，流傳到嘉慶道光年間，益發毫無詩道之可言了，幸而，這時　定盦崛起東南，光輝了文壇。</p>
<p>定盦的詩，詭艷雄奇，奔放千端，其情調之美，正如他自己很得意的頌　：「迴陽盪氣盛精靈」。</p>
<p>己亥雜詩三百十五首中其若干苜，使人讀了不易瞭解，因有中包含着一件隱秘的艷情，所以我們在探討共技巧與意味之前，應該先提起他的一件戀愛故事：</p>
<p>定盦在京師，官至禮部主事祠祭司行走，雖是冷署裏的一員閑曹，因為他的性格豪邁，耆奇好客，所交遊的，自然不乏王公搢紳，當時的淸苑王很賞識他，淸苑王有一位福晋（王妃）更是意外地思慕他的才華，兩人不由超出了封建勢力與禮敎儀度規定的範圍，定盦有一首傳誦一時的「憶宣武門內太平湖之丁香花」一首，其實就是為她作的：</p>
<p>「空山徙倚倦遊身，夢見城西閬苑春，一騎傳箋朱邸晚，臨風遞與縞衣人。』不僅是這一首，還有許多「憶京師鸞枝花」，「憶芍藥」「憶海棠」「憶丁香」……那常然也都是不得己的託詞，那詩是：</p>
<p>可惜南天無此花，腰身略似海棠斜，難忘槐市街南宅，小　羣芳稿一車。</p>
<p>可惜天南無此花，麗情還比牡丹奢，難忘西掖歸來早，贈與妝台滿鏡霞。</p>
<p>不是南天晚此花，北肥南瘦二分差，願移北地　支社，來問南朝油碧車。</p>
<p>弱冠尋芳數歲華，玲瓏萬玉　交加，難忘細雨紅泥寺，濕透春裘倚此花。</p>
<p>這些詩，雖然不能算是定　的代表作，卻都是已亥雜詩中的高潮，生命史上最可紀念的一頁。後來被淸苑王知道了，定盦恐因而得禍，於是在倉惶出都（道光己亥四月）。萬分的哀怨，都寫在雜詩裏。吳昌綬編的定盦先生年譜上沒有能詳細載出他出都的原因，僅是說：「才高動觸時忌，……乃乞養歸」。這自然是不可靠的官話。</p>
<p>相傳出都後，曾遇到一個來和他找麻煩的劍客，幸虧「少年擊劍更吹簫」的　定盦，並不是手無縛鷄之力的文人，於是拔劍周旋，那個劍客祗得甘拜下風了。雜詩中有：「幸汝生逢淸晏時，不然劍底桃花落。」之句，大概是指此事。</p>
<p>從此，他再也不敢到北京，但他還需要迎回匆匆未能偕行出京的眷屬，於是派了一個僕人入都，自己則徘徊於北京附近，終於不敢再進，在他的雜詩裏曾寫了那時倉惶的情緒：「北望觚稜南望雁，七行狂草達京華。」「漸近城南天尺五，迴燈不敢夢觚稜。」</p>
<p>二年後，暴疾而死，至今有人懷疑他的死，應與　事有關，可惜文獻不足，無法詳考，好在這裏不是考據他生平事蹟的，姑且置之，再來探討共詩的風味吧。</p>
<p>定盦詩的獨到之處，不僅好在辭藻和造意方面，因為詞意兼美還不一定是最好的詩，另外還要有特殊的一種作風，能表現偉大詩的個性，即是格調。定盒的格調，眞可說是高騫騰響不同凡俗了，他的格調充分表現了功力和才華的融會，試舉他的「秋心」兩苜：「秋心如海復如潮，惟有秋魂不可招……」和王漁洋膾炙一時的「秋柳」：「秋來何處最銷魂；殘照西風白下門。……」相比，就可以看出格調的高低了，龔的詩好像一個按劍凝視的俠上；王的詩則如一個低眉嬌笑的女兒，同是「秋」「魂」等字面的運用，語調不同，氣槪也不同。</p>
<p>黃仲則的詩的格調，多哀婉可憐之意，如：「夕陽勸客登樓去，」「愁多思買白楊栽。」「鬼　墳頭羨馬醫，」之類，比起定盦的「氣寒西北何人劍？」「美人如玉劍如虹」「罡風力大簸春魂」一類能奪人心魄的語調，則不堪敵，黃的詩如長吉鬼才，　的詩是靑運仙氣。</p>
<p>我發現定盦詩的作風有兩大　　，是變平淡爲奇突，化　唾　珠　的津梁：</p>
<p>一·奇拼：古人作詩，每一詞語必有典據，稍有不妥的，即不肯用，由於泥守舊規，致氣體不易闊大，詩途的新創作却愈過（愈少了。定　　則不然，善於運用素不相關的形容詞或動詞名詞，如「文章合有老波瀾，」「六朝古黛夢中橫」，「木樨風外等秋潮」，「四廂花影怒於潮」等等，都是奇拼妙合，是天才功力的結，往往道古人之所未道，解放了詩的領域。</p>
<p>二·巧岔：每一絕句之三四句，往往有使讀者絕對想不到之距離，是定盦特出的手法，如：「為恐劉郞英氣盡，卷簾梳洗望黃河。」豪邁狂縱的想像力，被這十四個字表現無餘。又：「門前報有關山客，來聽西齋夜雨聲。」「若使魯戈眞在手，斜腸只乞照書城。」「新詩急記銷魂事，分與胭脂一掏湯」都是以超出平凡意緒的靈感所寫成，這種作風，歷覽有唐以來，尙不可多見。</p>
<p>近代有兩個極其祟拜定盦的人，蘇曼殊和郁達夫，他們的詩，十分適近定盦的格調，自然是受了定盦作風的影響，同時，他們也是以一生生命的活力寫成了有生命的詩的詩人。他們已先後在這風雨飄搖的大時代中怛化了，吾人亦應致以永恒的追念。</p>
<h3>荷塘清趣</h3>
<p>— 許士騏</p>
<h3>白門春色</h3>
<p>— 秦嶺</p>
<p>幽柳，古堤，翠湖，青山，這訴不盡的思念之情呵。</p>
<p>假使您想下居於最合適的都市裏，那麼選上金險吧，道兒是城市山林又是山林城市，淸靜而不冷僻，熱鬧而不囂雜，有近代的素質更兼具古樸的風尙。</p>
<p>在白下我居住的時日並不長，但我願意把白下留給我的戀情分一半給您，這眞是個有山復有水，瑰偉而織秀的地方；春天裏，陽光閃爍地照着紫金山，乘着馬車奔馳在寬闊的綴滿綠樹的廣道上，田野間發散出暖暖的甜甜的泥土，與花草的氣息，從這裏直奔明陵，中山陵，靈谷寺，胸襟是够開朗的，花草在春風裏跳躍，蹄聲得得驚起了花叢的蝴蝶，穿林的溫風撫摸着您的臉面，春天活在你心裏了，且閉上眼作一個中古時代的夢吧，興趣濃厚的話，循山路而上更可上探紫霞洞，在這裏俯瞰金陵，有着飄渺於太空之間的舒服，您相信麽？</p>
<p>夏季，白下也許熱一點，然而這又何妨，陽光一偏西玄武湖畔便有了年靑人的足跡，我就最愛這一帶柳堤，細細的柳絲含烟　翠　抱了湖水，在堤上緩步過去，晚風輕輕捲起您的衣角，遠處五洲公園的白石建築靜躺在暮色裏，假使會操漿的話，雇上一葉小舟，徜徉於綠水之上，荷葉田田地舖滿水面，一枝枝蓮花探頭到船上來，停下槳藏身於荷花深處，靜靜歇息一會，水面的風夾着幽香使一切俗慮塵情都離你而去了。</p>
<p>還有莫愁湖的蘆花呢，莫愁湖雖然稍帶點寂寞，情味却相當深長，對着湖水蹙額的淸凉山幽幽地吐着黃色，湖畔叢叢蘆葦綴上幾絡白花，更有勝棋樓前的古槐，牠們都是屬於另一世界的，幽　而超然地躲在這寗靜的一隅，有着淡淡的憂　淡淡的愁。</p>
<p>再有可別忘了鼓樓，深色的紅牆隱蔽在蒼綠的樹叢裏，古意盎然，樓下是一片松林，有月色的晚上這裏是最美麗的，矗立着的紅樓曾看盡古城的滄桑之變，往昔的豪華定會引起鼓樓低幽的嘆息吧。</p>
<p>此外，您如有空暇，鷄鳴山，北極閣，胭脂井，白鷺洲，都是極有意思的去處，不然的話，在小街僻巷裏信步踱踱，烏衣巷，朱雀橋那一處不會勾起您濃　的懷古之情？</p>
<p>每天淸早，馬蹄聲敲着古城的晨夢之窗，整車的新鮮果蔬載到市集上去，趕車人輕圓溜熟的吆喝聲，繚繞在清醒的空氣裏，給人們一種親切的古樸味，而晚上，鷄鳴寺的鐘聲深邃而沉着，聲聲催人入夢，這都市，每個地方都沒忘記提醒我們：「它的素質永遠屬於我們祖先的時代。」</p>
<p>春天來了，常歡笑着的陽光投向石頭城時，什麽都恢復了生命；鳥語，花香，山光，水色，它古城已浮上幸福的湖面，帶給這我的祝福罷。</p>
<h3>高爾基的處女作</h3>
<p>— 符泊</p>
<p>高爾基的處女作是當他飄泊在外高加索，任職於一家工廠時，利用假日所寫成的，篇名「馬加爾周達」（Markar　Chudra），他親自送至一位報館的主筆先生處。</p>
<p>主筆略略地看了一週，發現　名下缺少了署名，他抬起頭問那個等候着的靑年：</p>
<p>「沒有署筆名？」</p>
<p>「沒有，隨你寫上一個吧——就用高爾基好了——瑪克辛，高爾基。」</p>
<p>主筆對於這突然說出來的名字似乎感到些驚訝和懷疑，他皺了眉問：</p>
<p>「這是不是你的眞名字？」</p>
<p>「不，我不想把眞名字給人知道，還是用假名字比較妥當。」</p>
<p>那篇文章不久就登了出來，「高爾基」這名字就這樣第一次出現在世上。那是在一八九二年的九月二十五日，判符載的報紙是第夫里斯白城的「喀富卡其」報。</p>
<h3>湖上雜寫</h3>
<p>— 姚妤</p>
<p>春</p>
<p>柔軟的東風把春之神吹到人問了。</p>
<p>春天是活潑的，充沛着生機的……</p>
<p>假如說：夏天是雄健的靑年，那末春天該是聖潔的少女；又假如說：夏天是嚴整的論文，那末春天該是美麗的詩篇。</p>
<p>春天是偉大的，它吹綠了湖畔的柳樹，也吹綠荒野的小草，春天如果是有感覺的和目的的話，它該是屬於宇宙的一切。然而春天也替人們帶來了許多「煩惱」，因此，我愛冬天，我更愛冬末春天欲來未來的日子。低吟稼軒：「春未來時先借問：晚恨開遲，早又飄零近；今歲花期消息定，只愁風雨無憑準……」的詞句，誰能無動心弦呵！</p>
<p>「矛盾」，「愛」和「憎」，「愉快」與「煩惱」，構成了春天的偉大，也反映了人生的偉大。</p>
<p>如果沒有「矛盾」，「愛」和「憎」，「愉快」與「煩惱」，這世界便將變成死的世界；憑着這點，使人與人，人與物更加密切，了解……</p>
<p>目前是動亂的大時代，充滿着矛盾；我們無須咀咒，也無須讚頌；用明察來代替麻木，分析應該重於感　。</p>
<p>春天，讓我拋却傷逝，從矛盾中來認識什麽是「愛」是「憎」吧！</p>
<p>塔</p>
<p>我從小就愛「塔」；我更愛夕陽渲染中的塔。三五隻　鷹在塔頂盤繞，一圈，兩圈，三圈……說也奇怪，我從不會對孤塔而感到寂寞，我常常目不轉睛地向她行注目禮，一直等到她伴着星星跨進黃昏之門。……</p>
<p>此刻，我一早起身，只要把視綫對準臨湖的窗子便可以恣意地瞭望那聳立在湖中巍峨的塔，內心彷彿也便有了信仰和主宰。</p>
<p>她——恒不倦怠的夜的守候者，許多湖邊的雜樹和野草，耐不住昨夜的狂風暴雨而偃折了，可是我們夜的守候者呵！依然屹立在湖的中央。</p>
<p>我曾經如此遐思：假使湖中沒有這一座塔，西子便將成為一個沒有靈魂的少女，失去了她的誘惑力和有生命的美。</p>
<p>塔，相傳是用來鎭壓妖魔的，重溫循大樹爬得很高的蔓藤和地上小草比較高低的故事，我覺得塔非但可以鎭壓妖魔，而且還以鎭壓人間可恥的依賴者和激動人間鄙夷的懦弱者呵！</p>
<p>我對着朝陽默禱；</p>
<p>讓我們的心中普遍地築起一座「塔」吧！</p>
<h3>夢外樓詩</h3>
<p>— 徐澄宇</p>
<p>答鐵橋</p>
<p>綺雲萬里壓天開，春動瑤葭六琯灰，為對豪情成美詠，忽傳佳句佐新醅。不逢楊子談經去，且共陶潛載酒來；醉後那知身是客，與君同酌夜光杯。</p>
<p>春華如繡落繽紛，美景當前略為君；人憶三湘愁　賦，詩成八詠擅休文；尋幽自步林問月，聽曲寗窺海上雲；知有江山無限意，後庭花好不須聞。</p>
<p>餘事君偏富好詩，詩成不用小奚隨；五雲才筆心猶壯，一練空江月似眉；野韵遙同孤鶴逸，哀吟莫　夜猿悲；更憐篇什新來健，黃絹初裁幼婦辭。</p>
<p>峽裏逢君幾度秋，文章空許敵曹劉；凄凉故國三千里，悵望元龍百尺樓；滄海何年徼外定，神京昨夜夢中收；楚江春棹同歸日，莫忘天南白鷺州。</p>
<h3>托爾斯泰語集</h3>
<p>— 金寧譯</p>
<p>不認識眞理而作惡的人我們為他們的犧牲可憐，為他們憂傷，因為他們只有對攻擊他們的人而行暴；但是認識眞理而作惡的人，他們在虛偽的面具下，所貽害的不但他們以及他們的犧牲者，還及於別的千百萬人，不過這些為　惡的謊言所蒙　了。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血200</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「走罷，咱們也上樓。」我這時瞰人漸次收小，借着街上射來的微光，漸漸看得出大廳上的各部位置。剛走了兩三步，眼前倐然漆黑，原來街燈也熄滅了。</p>
<p>「斷了電哪，」我自己咕　着，一手搭住「〇四」肩臂，探步前進。</p>
<p>「沒有吧，」「〇四」吿訴我，「自行梯那兒還有燈光。」「大傻子把升降機呌作「自行梯」；這是他創造的新名詞，大概從「自行車」聯想而成。</p>
<p>「您上二樓，還是上五樓？」升降機門外，有人這麼問我。</p>
<p>五樓是我的臨時機關；即使要上六樓w君的辦公室，也得先上五樓，因升降機只通到五樓。這人問我是否要上五樓，當然很對。但為什麼要問二樓呢？我因火廳裏發生了許多戲劇式的變北，一幕一幕，倒有些像映電影一般，因此把w君剛在樓上所說二樓夾道，可通間壁的話，鬧的忘了影兒。這時乍聽這人問到二樓，一時有些莫明其妙，不期然地衝口發出了這個疑問：</p>
<p>「二樓？」</p>
<p>「是，這裏門口，被鬼子兵堵住，所以大部份同志，都上二樓，走間　出去參加側擊去了。」</p>
<p>我一聽，這才想起了w君所說夾道的話，自己恕想好笑，同時想起了耀羣和虎城：</p>
<p>「看見咱們一位小姐和……」</p>
<p>是，早去了，……他們高興得跟趕塲去似的。」</p>
<p>我同「〇四」到了五樓，甬道上仍舊有低度燈光維持光錢，因知大街電流未斷，街上黑暗，想係敵方因要掩蔽，故意把街燈打燬了。走到我的屋子門口，剛想推門，却聽見屋內有人說話，是　見的聲音，語聲急促，完全日本語調。我很明白大槪是鶴見和萍子在內說話。我覺得不便進屋，便回身預備上六樓，並吩咐大傻子在這走道口上等着，有事可上六樓來找我。</p>
<p>「…追擊到東交民巷口，停止射擊，留兩個伏崗，大隊不必回總部，向各支部分散休息，等候命令……」</p>
<p>一進w君辦公室，聽到了這命令的尾聲。w君一面在電話裏發令，一而對我點點頭，用手虛邀作勢，讓我坐下。戴先生和馬秘書也在屋子裏，仍舊坐在以先坐的原位上，好像始終沒有走動過似的。我們都舉手打了招呼。</p>
<p>「您來得正好，」w君發完了命令對我笑着，「我們剛要討論這個機關的存廢問題，希望老兄參加意見。」</p>
<p>「這個怕得要問問鶴見和那位萍子小姐吧。」我表示了這個現成的意見。</p>
<p>「他們都在五樓；」w君吿訴我。</p>
<p>「對哪，我剛從五樓來，我屋子裏有人在說話，大概鶴見和那位萍子小姐都在那裏。鶴見的話聲很吭急，也許在同萍子爭辯什麼，我不顧參加，所以……」</p>
<p>「這位鶴見先生和萍子小姐是哪一類的關係？」戴先生很愼重的提出這個問題。大概w君還沒有工夫對戴先生報吿萍子的行為。</p>
<p>「在某種角度上，一一人似乎在進行合作。」w君很扼要簡潔的答覆了。</p>
<p>這句話在我口裏，至少要化成三四句甚至五六句，也許還不能說得如此淸楚而扼要。這個答覆，我感覺十分滿意，就令鶴見本人在這裏，火槪也只能這樣答覆。</p>
<h3>懷念</h3>
<p>— 沙蕾</p>
<p>我懷念着太多的人，太多的事，我時常感覺到我心魂的重量。在每一個黃昏，夜的風聲中或爐邊，那些故人和往事的緬懷簡直使我不可信地軟弱。</p>
<p>一些痛苦的記憶是凄厲的，可是一些溫柔的舊影卻更使我傷痛。當三月的苿莉花的濃郁的香氣伴隨着那些可愛的顏面，可親的語音同來，我竟不勝活着的負担了。</p>
<p>我經不起那種香氣和蜜味，我戰慄。</p>
<p>因此你會覺察到我是淡漠的，我彷彿有着神經衰弱者的健忘的才能，對歷史的負荷在輕蔑地解脫。</p>
<p>「是的，那也是這樣的雨夜，我們在黯淡的街燈下走，我們兩人撑着一把只有半邊的傘，我們大家爭奪着承受半邊破缺處淋下的雨，我們最後決定輪流着嘗味那淸凉……</p>
<p>「我們隨後到了小酒店」，你繼續說：「我們要了那麽許多鷄翅膀……」</p>
<p>「哦，有這些事嗎」？我一走很輕便地那樣回答，我不會回到那大森林裹去發　美好的時光</p>
<p>我只默默地看着，不像是冷淡，也不像是深情，我只要今天平靜地流去，明天和今天一樣地平靜，懷念昨天和幻想明天同樣使我沉重。</p>
<p>對坐在籐椅中大家抽一支煙，在茶室裏聽聽於我們無關的喧囂，這便是我的至福了。</p>
<p>我們又能站在一起實在是可欣幸的，因為斷了的時間還在延綿着，因為由於你的重現而使我卸去許多懷念的巨廈。</p>
<p>我要告訴你我為什麽這樣喜歡關着窗，在那　陽與皓月下，一些眸子和歌聲時常在巡行的，在無際的暗藍裏的許多星星，那一顆沒有棲止過我的夢境呢？</p>
<p>明天我也許要買一輻深色的窗帘，讓我有更恬靜的安息吧。我的友伴，讓你永遠陪伴着我，在我人生的對岸。你的風姿永遠閃耀着童心，使我回到一無所知的童年。</p>
<h3>獨泊溫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>現代的基督敎徒，也不再固執地否定科學了。他們都願意說，眞的科學是與上帝的通理相合，並且他們還引證Morse發明有綫電報時所發出的第一個電報是What　Hath　God　Wrought.那意思是上帝行了何等的大事。</p>
<p>若干傳敎士的結論，當然是引辛博生敎授的話說：「小科學家詆毀上帝，大科學郤永遠與基督敎的意見一致。」</p>
<p>其實，宗敎信仰與其他方面的認識是可以絕　的，各不相涉的。若干傳敎士的解釋都不免蛇足。</p>
<p>愛因斯坦是基督徒，並不因此損害他底「相對論」的存在。</p>
<p>宗敎信仰，在某一個角度看來，那只是情感被鬰結後的昇華。沒有疑問的，音樂家這一方面盡了最大帮助的力量。</p>
<p>有信仰的人是有福的了。</p>
<p>而具有淸明認識的人，却時常痛苦。</p>
<p>我的理由是——</p>
<p>認識隨時空不停地在變動，前進。</p>
<p>而信爺基於永遠朦朧的虔誠，有恒而且堅定。沒有「為什麽」三個字可問。</p>
<p>「坦白」往往可以戰勝「虛偽」。</p>
<p>人自三代以降，莫不好名；所好者又往往是虛名。俗話說：「打腫了臉充胖子」，這同孟軻書中所形容有一妻一妾的齊人，是再好沒有的兩個例子。</p>
<p>人若能看破這個虛字，我想是可以省去許多不相干的麻煩的。</p>
<p>漢朝時，南粵王趙佗造反。這位南粵王的是地位和金錢。如果生當二十世紀五十年代，大可到美國去玩玩，推其造反之由，只在想獲得「皇帝」兩個字的虛榮。</p>
<p>漢文帝眞是了不得的英雄，他給趙佗去了一封信。開塲便來撒手鐧，他說：「朕先皇帝側室之子。」迻譯成語體就是：「俺做皇帝的是我爸爸小老婆的兒子。」</p>
<p>趙佗的虛榮心整個被撕碎了。「他媽的，至　的萬歲爺，開口便自承是小老婆的兒子。我還用得着造反嗎？」不費一兵一卒，野心家只好歸順了。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>關於「商務」近況</h3>
<p>— 黑星</p>
<p>我很想有計劃訪問一下全上海幾個比較著名的書局，問問他們在出版條件這樣困難的今天，在購買力這樣低落的現在，他們遭遇着多少困難。</p>
<p>首先，我去了商務印書館。「商務」在中國文化史上及學術界的貢獻，應該是無可比擬的。</p>
<p>大家都知道，他們戰前規模很大的印刷廠和中國唯一圍書館——東方岡書館，都毀之於抗日的戰火。</p>
<p>單就這兩個單位的損失，已經是無法估計他的數字了。</p>
<p>「商務」在全國共有四個機構，他的地點，分設在上海，香港，重慶，北平，而總管理處則在上海。</p>
<p>上海總管理處和門市部，就設在上海著名的文化街上，所謂棋盤街；實際的地位，是在四馬路河南路口。他們的編審部設在愛麥虞限路，印刷廠（規模很小）則設在王家沙。</p>
<p>「商務」現在的總經理兼編審所所長，是朱經農先生，他是學術界知名之士，不用我們介紹。前總經理王雲五，他現在是「商務」的董事之一，想來他對於將來「商務」的發展，一定有很大的帮助。</p>
<p>和我接談的人物，在編審部方面是蘇繼卿先生，他由重慶來上海才不過一個月。蘇先生一向負責主編「東方雜誌」。蘇先生兩鬢斑白，可見處事之辛勞。</p>
<p>我對條先生提出幾個簡單的問題：</p>
<p>關於最近出書的情形。</p>
<p>蘇先生說：現在還是每日出書一本，不過積壓着沒有印出來的書太多了，甚至於在「八一三」以前打好紙版的書，現在都尙未出版的都有。不過現在復員後一切條件都比較戰時好，書自然可以加速地印行。</p>
<p>在印刷方面，現在上海的廠規模小得很，所以還採取戰時委托印刷的辦法。</p>
<p>商務和著作人的關係，據蘇先生說是大部份都是抽版稅，以售出書價抽百分之十五，每年結算三决，以稿費計算的少得很，即使有，每千字是一萬五千元。</p>
<p>我曾經提出「商務」戰時損失太重，「復員」後，政府方面是否能有所補助？</p>
<p>蘇先生的回答是否定的。他說；</p>
<p>「商務決定自力更生，不預備接受任何補助。」不過商務與敎育部是有一點關係的十，這就是國立編譯館所有著作，都委托「商務」印行，一切印刷，發行都由「商務」担任。而這些書籍的版稅，也由商務付給。</p>
<p>這就是商務與政府唯一的關係。（上）</p>
<h3>城市不堪　錫到　　　語畫樓前</h3>
<p>— 子愷</p>
<h3>植樹有感</h3>
<p>— 殊响</p>
<p>「植樹節」已過去了。</p>
<p>一到那節，咱們的地方官兒們，都大大的忙　一番，今年也不例外，這濱海小城的龍山上，八點鐘光景，就擠上許多人頭，大家拼命看縣長老爺植樹的姿勢，縣長老爺的手真白，與難為他拿這笨重的鋤頭種對樹，許多老百姓暗暗說。</p>
<p>蝸居離山甚近，開門見山，看見山上擠滿許多人時，便很自然的想起這一年一度的植樹節了，不過年年植樹，這座山上卻終看不見多出樹來，樹苗在這里幾乎變成漏水之斗，牛山灌灌，枉資了縣長老爺的心力，農場裏新鮮的樹苗。</p>
<p>中國人善於欺侮花樹，除開公回裏有警察保護外，隨你到任何山野，終看見許多遊客，會隨便折取樹幹，攀枝剝皮，大樹尙且如此，種下去的樹苗，或者被遊客蹂躪，或者被樵夫濫伐。</p>
<p>抗戰期中，樹却是最有效的保護物，大人先生可以攢入堅固的地下室，防空壕，平民百姓，就只有在樹蔭下躲避了，頭上飛機作饗，耳畔炸彈齊轟，那時眞希望樹葉越長得密越好，住在牛山濯濯的地方時，第一是失望，第二是恨！</p>
<p>戰火蔓延，報上有時又發現某地被炸，某地被襲的消息了。敝縣今年植樹，農林塲的大門口，便掛起一副頗有意義的對聯：</p>
<p>「莫忘警報狂鳴，絜女携男藉蔭蔽。</p>
<p>須求國防永固，齊心協力植森林。」</p>
<p>植樹的功效，除開調劑水旱之外，原來還有防空的意義的。</p>
<h3>談市政</h3>
<p>— 長流</p>
<p>上海公用事業前一時盛傅即將加價，而後來據官方所發表的公報，是「公用事業」最近一槪不准加價。如有短少，將由市府償還。</p>
<p>「公用事業」不加價，眞是為萬民造福，人民受惠不淺。但是，市政府屢次向參議會呼籲，要求追加預算，可見市府本身經費已經困難異常，對於這一筆龐大的「公用事業」補償費，不知從何處開支？</p>
<p>我們以爲，上海的市政，確到困難萬狀的階段，眞如吳市長對記者們說，他本人很想離開上海。這就是說，上海市政，確實不容易對付。</p>
<p>一方面，上海是全國經濟的中心，又是遠東國際最大的都市，人口已經超越四百萬，眼前擺着的問題，諸如房荒，交通的擁擠，物價的騰漲，衛生的設施，市政的整理，市塲的控制，市府經費的支絀，那怕你是具有最高智慧與才華的人物來主持上海市政，都感覺頭痛萬分的。</p>
<p>但是，我們站在一個市民的立塲，應當鼓勵市政每一個單位和每一個工作人員，上海旣然是全國都市的表率，我們就應該全力和一切困難奮鬥，生活，本身即是「戰爭」！</p>
<p>我們應該有只許「勝」，不身「敗」的決心。</p>
<p>有人說過，我們應該和最困難的問題奮鬥，上海市政，也幷不例外。</p>
<h3>點櫻花</h3>
<p>— 胡盧</p>
<p>漢奸家屬請求發還名貴傢具</p>
<p>作偽官貪，無疑傢具多名貴，聚人民淚，醜飾奸門第！</p>
<p>訝請求奇，何不知羞恥？奸名字，竟忘汚穢，還想多回味？</p>
<h3>戀愛離婚與夫婦　婚後能結交異性朋友麼？</h3>
<p>— 芳</p>
<p>根據報載：去年度美國的離婚統計，大部份的原因是為了婚後夫婦的一方單獨結交異性友人，而最多的是為了妻子結交男方。粗看這新聞，似乎很奇怪，想不到在社交極度公開的美國，結交異性會成為離婚的最多原因？其實這裏的所謂友誼，實際上當已超出了友誼的範圍，人們大多分不淸友誼和戀愛的界限，再加上誤會和戀愛道德的衰落，很容易就造成三角的關係，而終至夫婦仳離！</p>
<p>在我國現社會裹，戀愛上的道德更薄弱，司空見慣的離婚案件裏，這類情形想也不在少數，因此就値得我們加以注意了。</p>
<p>本來從友誼到戀愛雖然需要經過一個階段，然而其間却實在並沒有明顯的鴻溝，沒有人能够發現自身是在戀愛的開始裏；常您發現您在戀愛中時，「開始」往往已經早過去了，因此婚後亦友，稍不謹愼，稍不抑制，悲劇便極易發生。</p>
<p>首先我們得避免婚後夫婦的一方單獨結交異性友人，夫婦應該是一個單體，無論對任何友人的的會或書信最好都是共同的，即使是一次單獨的，甚至是秘密的約會，或書信，都將是一個毒癌，一枝不幸的根芽，夫婦間假使還有事不能公開；那末事先就根本可以不必結婚了。</p>
<p>戀愛本來就是一種犧牲，假使您不能為您的愛人犧牲您的異性友人的話，那末說老實話，您對於您愛人的愛實在祇是浮泛的，盲目的，建築在浮沙上的愛，這種愛實在是靠不住的。朋友！您得愼重的檢討考慮一番了，　然的結合，只是痛苦的開始！一</p>
<p>別在夫婦之間有些口角時，就乞慰於友人，這非但與事實無補，却極易引起波浪，因為這類乞慰一定會得到良好的反應，這時受慰者一定感覺到自己的配偶還不如一個友人來得了解自已，而因此更加深了裂痕；其實，朋友，您試反省，任何人對配偶以外的異性，總是客氣溫和的，等他成了您的配偶時，恐怕就又不同了。再說，您的配偶在和您戀愛的階段時，或和您在友誼的階段時，一定比您其他的友人更能安慰您，是不是？所以當有爭執時，主要的是諒解，而不是乞慰他人。</p>
<p>作為一個第三者的立塲，您切不要插身在一對夫婦的糾紛裏，單方面的安慰允不可有，那是有百害而無一利的，夫婦間的爭執，只能夫婦間自謀解決，一切外力徒然增加了紛爭，却永遠得小到美滿的解決，您更不要對夫婦的一方單獨發生或存在着友誼，您應該把一對夫婦看作一個單體，這會减少許多無謂的誤會。</p>
<p>結婚是一種合作，您不能把幸福的責任推在您的對方一人身上，您自己也得担負起一半責任來，在互忠，互助，互諒，互忍之下，婚姻將永遠是美滿幸福的。</p>
<p>（編者按：芳君的意思，男女結婚以後，應捨棄你所有的異性朋友，至少不容許你單獨和你的異性朋友往來，這點意見，在原則上，是値得討論的；　希望讀者能提出一點獨到的意見。）</p>
<h3>最甜最甜的東西</h3>
<p>— 慶桐</p>
<p>美國化學學會接到報吿：荷蘭丹爾夫工專　爾特敎授發明一種新的化學物質，比糖甜四千倍。據說放極微的一點在舌上，就會覺到甜味半小時。</p>
<p>戰時這發明品在荷蘭配製，却沒有給敵人知道。它是一族七兄弟中之最甜者，其餘六個比糖甜一百廿倍至二千倍不等。韋爾特敎授宣稱別的人造糖吃了要留下餘味，唯有它並無此種缺點。還有一個好處：它的甜度出奇地高。糖精（煤　的衍化物）比糖甜二百至七百倍，都爾新（Dulcin）更不行，祗有七十至二百五十倍，與它的四千倍一比，優劣剖然。</p>

<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「他們還要去重慶。我表哥恰好在兩個月前先走了，他根本也沒有跟我提起過這件事。」徐胖子搶着給她向老祝說明。「老祝，你不是在我這兒見過他嗎？就是那個一天到晚研究生物學的胡敎授！連牌也不打，戲也不看，酒也不喝，朋友也不要的書獃子！」</p>
<p>「噢！胡覺文。對了，對了」祝兆年也就明白了。眼前立刻現出了一個終年鬚髮篷鬆，披一件藍布大掛的矮子的幻影。</p>
<p>「淪陷區跟這兒來去的信住往容易失落，也許覺文根本沒有知道我們要進來。」被老祝喚做蘭的少婦這樣解釋。她的話說得緩而淸楚，態度稍微有些矜持。「祝先生，眞想不到會在這兒遇見你！那時候我和李湘她們全以為你在去海防的輪船上失事了。豈知那是一個可怕的謠言！」</p>
<p>說到最後一句話，她的聲音禁不住有一些顫抖，老祝的一顆心也就跟着顫抖起來。他簡直想在呌一陣，又想立刻撲過去緊緊地抓住那一雙他已有十一年沒有接觸到的手。最後，他終於黯然低下了頭去，好久不能說話。</p>
<p>「這倒是眞的。那一年，上海有許多朋友全當你是死了，想不到兩年之後，你還是活着回來，而眞正送命的倒是你的哥哥。哈哈哈！」事不關心的徐胖子，想起了這件事也覺得怪有趣似的。</p>
<p>祝兆年慢慢地昂起頭來，瞧着他所刻骨難忘的人慘然一笑。</p>
<p>「可怕的謠言。」他喃喃地說：「這個謠言帶給我的損失眞是太大了！」</p>
<p>那女婦突然很快地轉過身去，臉向窗外，半響不作聲。</p>
<p>老徐不很注意地向老祝看了一眼，又望一望自己手腕上的錶。</p>
<p>「來！老祝，喝酒去！」他興高采烈地說：「我太太雖然走了，阿史做的菜還不錯。今天給二表嫂接風，加幾個菜，你們旣然是熟人，正好做伴客。走吧！」</p>
<p>他做個手勢，指一指左邊的餐廳，　兆年點點頭，第一個走出了會客室去，他並沒有再向那少婦看。</p>
<p>「二表嫂，請用飯吧，車子的事回頭再商量。」主人招呼着。（十六）</p>

<h3>Maintaining Traditional Friendship with the US and Strictly Implementing the Sino-Soviet Treaty: Minister Wang Reports on Foreign Affairs at the Plenary Session</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The first session of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee was held at the National Assembly Hall at 9:30 AM on the 16th. 239 Central Committee members attended. After Chairman Sun Ke and Secretary-General Wu reported on documents, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie reported on foreign affairs, stating briefly that the government's foreign policy over the past year had been carried out in accordance with the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session and the instructions of the Chairman. He then elaborated on (1) China's relationship with and position in the United Nations, (2) Sino-US relations, (3) Sino-Soviet relations, (4) diplomatic issues with Britain, France, and other countries. The report lasted two hours and the meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Foreign Minister Wang delivered a foreign affairs report at the Third Plenary Session on the morning of the 16th, elaborating on major diplomatic events and China's foreign policy over the past year. Before his report, Wang stated that this oral report was a supplement to the written report he submitted to the session and would be limited to a few issues concerning fundamental foreign policy. In his report, Wang clarified China's foreign policy, which can be summarized as supporting and upholding the United Nations organization, maintaining traditional friendship with the United States, strictly implementing the Sino-Soviet treaty with the Soviet Union, and not adopting retaliatory measures against Japan but seeking full military guarantees to prevent it from launching another aggression. Wang first reported on China's relationship with the United Nations, stating that since its establishment in May last year, the UN's organization has become increasingly complete, its power has become increasingly strong, and its status has become extremely important. Wang believes that the United Nations can be expected to develop into an organization for maintaining world peace, because after the war, countries, regardless of size or strength, have a fear of war and urgently hope for the rapid realization of an organization capable of maintaining peace. Wang summarized China's position on the United Nations as advocating for limiting the use of the veto power without amending the UN Charter, promoting international armed forces and disarmament, and constantly urging their early implementation. Wang then reported on Sino-US relations, stating that China's basic policy towards the United States is to maintain the traditional friendship between China and the United States and to develop Sino-US cooperation. He stated that during the past year, General Marshall's mission to China assisted in the repatriation of more than two million Japanese prisoners and residents in China. If these Japanese had not been repatriated on schedule, it would have greatly hindered China's recovery and reconstruction efforts. Wang also reported on the signing of the Sino-US commercial treaty, the issue of the US military advisory group, and the issue of US economic assistance. When discussing Sino-Soviet relations, Wang reviewed the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Northeast last year and the government's active preparations for taking over the administrative rights of Lushun and Dalian. Regarding the Moscow Conference, Wang detailed the reasons for his refusal to allow the foreign ministers in Moscow to discuss China's internal affairs in any way, and expressed his belief that the foreign ministers would ultimately respect the Chinese government's position and the sentiments of the Chinese people and cease discussing China's internal affairs. Subsequently, Wang reported on the Japanese issue, stating that China is determined not to adopt a policy of revenge, but in the military sphere, there must be sufficient guarantees to prevent Japan from engaging in aggression again. Finally, Wang reported on the protection of overseas Chinese in Vietnam, the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies, and the recent negotiations concerning the Xisha Islands. Regarding Sino-British relations, Wang stated that significant progress has been made recently. The prospects for Sino-Indian diplomatic relations are also very optimistic. Wang's report lasted a total of two hours.</p>
<h3>Proposals on Foreign Affairs Have Been Reviewed and Completed</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Proposals on foreign affairs from the plenary session were reviewed and completed in the review committee on the afternoon of the 16th. According to sources, the main points are as follows: (1) Reaffirming China's determination to uphold and cherish world peace. China's post-war reconstruction depends on international peace and cooperation. China should consistently strive for mutual respect and mutual assistance among friendly countries to eliminate international contradictions. (2) The permanent members of the UN Security Council should strengthen their ties. (3) China, with a friendly attitude and a firm stance, will strictly implement the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance so that the treaty truly becomes the foundation for peaceful cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. (4) The sovereignty of member states stipulated in the UN Charter, with the principle of non-interference in internal affairs as the basis for world peace, must be implemented. (5) The integrity of territorial sovereignty is what the country sincerely depends on. This party will continue the efforts and maintenance of the national revolution for more than 50 years. (6) This party should express deep sympathy and respect for the movements for national independence around the world, but should do its best to protect the lives and property of overseas Chinese. (7) Do not adopt a policy of revenge against Japan, but the resurgence of its militaristic aggression should be prevented by cooperation among the Allied nations, and its political democratization should be promoted. As for the heavy losses of life and property suffered by China in Japan's war of aggression, it should be responsible for earnestly compensating for them through just, fair, and legal demands. (8) Under the principle of equality and mutual benefit, international capital and technology cooperation are welcomed.</p>

A tank car of kerosene was burned in Shangqiu a few days ago, and a tank car of Western medicine was burned in Daying, both due to prolonged delays in freight transport, resulting in accidents. Many transportation businesses have gone bankrupt.</p>
<h3>Relief Troops and Garrison Troops Joined Forces Yesterday Afternoon, The Siege of Nongan City Completely Lifted, The Communist Army's Fourth Offensive Collapsed Again</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th Urgent Dispatch] The war on the outskirts of Changchun took a sharp turn for the better, and the National Army achieved another victory. The communist troops in the pocket-shaped area around Nongan and between the Chang-Ha lines completely collapsed at dawn on the 16th. The National Army is attacking in multiple directions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th, 2:00 PM] The fourth offensive launched by Lin Biao's communist troops in Songbei has now been completely defeated. Nongan City, which was besieged for 60 hours from the evening of the 13th, has been relieved. This is the result of General Du Yuming's new command. According to preliminary estimates, the communist troops suffered at least 20,000 casualties. The remaining communist troops are fleeing in all directions north, northwest, and northeast around Nongan. The National Army in Nongan, Dehui, and other places is pursuing and intercepting them in separate ways, continuing to expand the results of the battle.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th] The communist offensive on the Changtao Line was frustrated. The highway between Changchun and Nongan was completely opened at noon on the 16th. The elite troops of the National Army that reinforced Nongan entered Nongan County at 2:00 PM on the 16th, joining forces with the garrison troops. The threat of Nongan City being surrounded on three sides by heavy communist troops was lifted. It is generally believed that the main battle near Nongan has entered a decisive stage, and the fate of the main force of the communist troops near Liangyimen, 20 li southeast of Nongan, can be determined within 24 hours.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th] The war at Wanbaoshan in the northwest corner of Changchun has ended. The communist troops, from the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, and 5th brigades of the East Manchurian Military Region, totaling 30,000, fiercely attacked Wanbaoshan from the 13th. The artillery fire was fierce, and they attacked for three days, but were all severely beaten by the National Army, suffering heavy losses. Before dawn on the 16th, the communist troops made a desperate all-out attack. After the National Army calmly fought back, they were defeated near Xinanhhe. The National Army took advantage of the victory to recover Laochenjiawotun, 25 li northeast of Wanbaoshan, and advanced to 50 li north of Wanbaoshan. Another surrendered brigade commander, Dai Huajin, reinforced the battle at Liangyimen.</p>
<p>Relief Process</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th] The communist troops who suffered a disastrous defeat in their fourth invasion of the outskirts of Changchun had a total force of about 120,000 people, forming the 1st, 2nd, and 6th communist columns. They crossed the river in five directions from Wujiazhan, Taolaizhao, and Wukeshu on the 8th, with great momentum. The National Army used a small force of several battalions to block their main force at Xiaoshantun, northwest of Dehui, for three days. It was not until 7:00 PM on the 13th that the communist troops from all directions approached the outskirts of Nongan and engaged in pre-war battles with the garrison troops. At 1:00 PM on the 14th, the communist troops bombed Nongan for two hours and then began to attack the city. From dawn on the 15th, the attacks did not cease. The Nongan National Army always firmly defended the city walls and did not retreat a single step. At this time, the new forces of the National Army pre-positioned in the suburbs of Changchun began to attack Nongan to the southeast and south in separate ways. At noon at 12:00, they advanced to Baijiagangzi, Lujiatun, Liangyimen, Qianbian and Dijiawopeng, south of Nongan City. The communist troops resisted with all their might, and the battle was fierce. By midnight at 12:00, the communist troops were gradually unable to support themselves. At dawn today, the National Army inside and outside Nongan City launched another fierce attack, and the communist troops completely collapsed and fled in the wilderness, in an extremely embarrassed state. At noon, the National Army entered Nongan City from Baijiagangzi, Luojiatun, and Liangyimen, and shook hands with the National Army in the city.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Thousands of communist troops have surrendered to the National Army in the Nongan area today. In the Battle of Nongan, communist troops were killed everywhere. In the Luojiatun and Liangyimen areas south of the city alone, 1,500 bodies were left behind. Reporters from various newspapers and news agencies here are scheduled to go to the county on the 17th for an on-site inspection.</p>
<h3>The Battle Situation on the Jinpu Line Takes a Sharp Turn for the Better, The National Army Enters Sishui and Tai'an, The Curfew Time in Jinan is Shortened</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Xuzhou, 16th] The National Army recovered Sishui at 4:00 PM on the 16th, but the fighting in the suburbs is still fierce. Also, Nanxinji, southwest of Sishui, was also recovered by the National Army this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Xuzhou, 16th] The battle for Tai'an is in full swing. Wang Yaowu's troops marched south along the Jinpu Railway and joined forces with the National Army marching north between Wande and Feicheng on the 15th. On the 16th, Wang Yaowu's troops continued to march south and have now crossed Jieshou, flanking Tai'an with the National Army on the west side of the Jinpu Railway. After defeating the resistance of the communist troops, one of the National Army entered Tai'an this afternoon and will join forces with the National Army marching north from Dawenkou within days.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Jinan, 16th] There has been no major contact on the outskirts of Jinan, Qingdao, and Weifang in recent days. The battle in the mountainous area of Mount Tai on the Jinpu Line is continuing. The strength of the communist troops has increased to four divisions and one brigade, with more than 60,000 people. The National Army is strengthening its pressure from west to east. Chen Yi, fearing an attack, has moved his headquarters to the large mining area near Zichuan. At the same time, the pseudo-Shandong Provincial Government has also moved to Shantouzhuang, east of Zichuan.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Jinan, 16th] The situation in Jinan has eased. Starting from the 16th, the curfew time, which originally started at 8:00 PM, has been changed to 9:00 PM. When things were tense last month, the business corps members who were called up were immediately demobilized by the authorities in consideration of the difficulties of the business community.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Xuzhou, 16th] More than 3,000 remnants of the communist Zhang Taisheng's troops sneaked into Shanchengji and Huoshenmiao on the border of Xiao County and Yongcheng, 60 kilometers southwest of Xuzhou, on the 15th, with the intention of attacking Xiao County. The National Army is encircling and attacking them.</p>
<h3>60,000 Troops Gathered Between Dalian and Pulandian, The Communist Army Plans to Resist Takeover, Military Inspection Discusses the Situation in Liaodong</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Shenyang, 16th] According to a military observer, judging from the communist troops' continuous reinforcements and disturbances in recent months, the communist troops really have the intention and determination to desperately "defend" Dalian and refuse the government's takeover. Dalian is the main supply base for the communist troops in Hebei and Shandong, and the hub connecting northern North Korea and North China. Its military, political, and economic relations have a great impact on the overall situation. Since last winter, the communist troops have retreated all the remaining troops in southern Liaoning to the area north of Shihe, and have relied on special forces to actively replenish and train. Therefore, their independent divisions and other units were revived. Later, their 12th and 29th brigades also entered this special area one after another, but the 11th brigade never had the opportunity to enter. In addition, a part of the reinforcements from Shandong and another group of cadres were transferred to form three regiments on the spot. Recently, Korean communists landed in Dalian. Thus, the total force between Pulandian and Dalian, including regular and disguised communist troops, has reached more than 60,000 people. The National Army's future task of taking over Dalian will definitely not be achieved without bloodshed. The communist troops will resist with all their strength, which is expected. However, the morale of the National Army waiting to advance is extremely high, and they have full confidence. After the National Army's takeover task is completed, the entire southern Liaoning area will no longer have communist troops to worry about.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Shenyang, 16th] The preparations for the takeover of Dalian have been basically completed. The National Army in Pulandian and other places is removing various obstacles for the receivers. Gong Xuesui may come to Shenyang next week to handle the takeover matters.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The Chairman met with Dong Yingbin at 9:00 PM on the 16th and gave many instructions on the issue of taking over Dalian.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Changchun, 16th] After the National Army began to attack on the outskirts of Nongan and Dehui, the communist troops collapsed. The National Army is now tightening the pocket of Changchun, Nongan, and Dehui. The communist troops surrounded include the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 17th, and 18th divisions. The National Army marching north along the Changtao Line joined forces with the Nongan garrison troops at 12:00 noon today.</p>
<h3>The Joint Defense of Hebei, Chahar, and Rehe is Inaccurate, Wang Hongshao Speaks Freely to Reporters About Military Affairs</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 16th] Wang Hongshao, Chief of Staff of the Beiping Headquarters, spoke freely about the current military situation at the invitation of the Beiping City Reporters Association this morning: (1) In the Chahar and Suiyuan area: Suiyuan is stable, only Qingshuihe, Tuoketuo, Helin, and Fengzhen, which border with other provinces, have occasional small disturbances. There is a communist Suiyuan military region in Fengzhen, training troops. Small units of Outer Mongolian troops are seen searching for information in the areas bordering Outer Mongolia in northern Suiyuan. There are more than 1,000 communist troops near Pingdingbao, north of Guyuan, Chahar Province. There are three regiments of communist troops in Chicheng, Yanqing, and other places in eastern Chahar. Communist troops harassed Fanshanbao, south of Chahar, the day before yesterday. (2) After the National Army recovered Gucheng in Hebei Province, the National Army did not advance further. At the moment, a part of the communist troops sneaked into the mountainous area of western Hebei, and most of them sneaked into the plains of central Hebei. There are two brigades south of the Yongding River, with no major movements. There has been no major activity near the two armies in eastern Hebei. There are often small reports of damage south of Lutai on the Beining Line, and communist troops are sneaking around south of the railway. The National Army continues to protect transportation and security.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] According to Wang Hongshao, the reports of the joint defense of Hebei, Chahar, and Rehe are inaccurate. At the moment, Rehe is still under the jurisdiction of the Northeast Headquarters. However, the central government representatives in Rehe decided earlier and the Suiyuan political review meeting recently suggested to the central government to assign Rehe to the Beiping Headquarters, but so far no order from the central government on this matter has been received. He did not acknowledge or deny the reports that the 12th war zone had been transferred back from the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, only saying that troop movements are common in military affairs, and that the strength of the National Army in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway has not been weakened.</p>
<h3>Internal Friction Among the Communist Troops in the Northeast is Becoming Increasingly Serious</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th] The pro-war faction in Yan'an has long proposed to replace Zhang Xuesi, because Lin Biao, commander-in-chief of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army, is not enough to make the people of the Northeast believe in him, and his party qualifications are too shallow, fearing that he cannot be firm in his will. After Lin learned of this, he expressed that people who had not decided could not be commanded by Zhang, and therefore friction occurred between the two troops. This kind of friction has recently become increasingly serious.</p>
<h3>The National Army Recovers Jinpenwan</h3>
<p>The Location of He Long's Headquarters</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Xi'an, 16th] The National Army recovered Jinpenwan, the location of He Long's headquarters and the concentration of Yan'an military agencies, this afternoon. The area belongs to Ganquan County, 20 kilometers west of Linzhen Town, which was recovered by the National Army on the south bank of the Fen River the day before yesterday. From this important stronghold, 15 kilometers northwest along the main road, you can enter the territory of Yan'an County, and 20 kilometers further will reach Lian County.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Xi'an, 16th] The communist units under the command of He Long on the southern line of Yan'an have been identified as the 4th, 11th, 358th, 359th, and 1st, 2nd, and 3rd guard brigades, as well as the engineering, transport, artillery, and assassination regiments.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 15th] Colonel Sears, head of the US observation group, who recently withdrew from Yan'an and arrived here, told a United Press reporter today: "The evacuation work in Yan'an is proceeding day and night in a planned manner. Very few people are currently staying in the city, and Europeans and Americans have also taken refuge in the mountains. Most of these are rescue workers."</p>
<h3>More and More Communists Defect</h3>
<p>The Youth Training Corps of the First War Zone</p>
<p>Has Incorporated 35 Squadrons</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Xi'an, 16th] The number of CCP members who surrender and defect continues to increase. To date, the Youth Training Corps of the First War Zone has incorporated 35 squadrons. Some have been given funds to return to their hometowns, and the sick and wounded have been given medical treatment.</p>
<h3>The Repair Work of Ji-Chang Railway Ying Jiu Jian is Progressing Smoothly</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 16th] The repair work of the Ji-Chang Railway between Yingchengzi and Jiutai has been progressing smoothly in recent days. The Jiutai water plant has also been repaired, and the Ji-Chang regular telephone line will be connected soon.</p>
<h3>All-Around Conference Anecdotes</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] All-Around Conference Anecdotes:</p>
<p>(1) Yesterday the weather was overcast and layers of clouds densely covered the sky, but today it is a clear blue sky and the climate has also turned warmer, making the conference venue appear more lively. Two hundred and twenty-three Central Committee members and sixty-six Supervisory Committee members attended. The atmosphere inside the conference was also much more lively. However, because the National Assembly Hall is spacious, it still seemed quite sparse. Nevertheless, compared to past Central Executive Committee meetings, such as the one held in the Chongqing National Government Auditorium, which was small and crowded, and the Second Plenary Session of last year, which borrowed the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission Auditorium and also appeared packed and congested, this is vastly different. One Central Committee member said that the provisional capital is indeed not as good as the capital, which is certainly a true statement.</p>
<p>(2) Today was the opening session of the conference. The chairman was Sun Ke, with Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng on his left. It was shortly after his sixtieth birthday. He was immaculately dressed in a Western suit, frequently leaving his seat to coordinate and direct things, appearing very busy. On his right was Deputy Secretary-General Wang Qijiang. On one side was the newly appointed Nanjing Civil Affairs Bureau Director Zhang Shouxian, and on the other was Wang Gongji, who is about to go to France to head our country's press office in Paris. These figures sat as usual on the chairman's platform, writing with great speed and handling matters with ease and proficiency. Their dignified presence added much to the conference.</p>
<p>(3) Because reporters from various newspapers were unable to attend the conference, it relied on Central Committee members who are currently active in the press to personally write reports. Among the Central Committee members with press qualifications are Chen Bulei, Chairman of the Central Daily News; Pan Gongzhan, President of the Shen Bao; Cheng Cangbo, President of the Xinwen Bao; Xiao Tongzi, President of the Central News Agency; Ma Xingye, President of the Central Daily News; Huang Shao-gu, President of the Heping Daily News; Hu Jianzhong, President of the Southeast Daily News; and chief writer Hu Qiuyuan. Chairman Ma personally wrote an article titled "Gleanings from the CEC Meeting" for the Central Daily News yesterday, greatly enhancing the quality of the newspaper. It is commendable that these people do not forget their journalistic duties while attending the conference and continue to serve the readers.</p>
<p>(4) An important item on the agenda of today's opening session was Foreign Minister Wang's report on foreign affairs. During the report, the entire venue was silent, listening attentively and with nervous anticipation. Foreign Minister Wang spoke with measured pauses, clear organization, and systematic order, maintaining the demeanor of a veteran university professor. The audience sat upright and held their breath for two hours. Speakers praised Foreign Minister Wang for being eloquent and capable, stating that it is certainly not easy to negotiate on the international stage. Before yesterday's report, Wang arrived at the conference in the same car as Luo Jialun. Wang sat in the first seat of the second row, closing his eyes in quiet contemplation to gather his energy before taking the stage. After taking the stage, he spoke fluently and logically. Everyone in the audience was impressed by Foreign Minister Wang's eloquence.</p>
<p>(5) When Foreign Minister Wang Shijie reported on foreign affairs today, it seemed that he had more white hair than at the Second Plenary Session of the previous year, but his voice was still strong and resonated to the back of the hall. The report was entirely from memory, and the dates and numbers were presented without error. The chapters were divided as follows: first, the relationship between China and the United Nations and its position; second, the process of diplomatic negotiations between China and the United States and China and the Soviet Union; and third, the issues of China and Japan and the issue of Vietnam, as if he were delivering a lecture, with systematic order. Before Wang's report, he said, "After you all leave the venue, you will surely be surrounded by reporters," hoping they would keep it confidential. After the meeting, reporters from various newspapers eagerly inquired with the attending Central Committee members, but they all kept silent and did not reveal the main points. It can be said that Wang had foresight.</p>
<p>(6) After the opening of this morning's first meeting, Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng first announced a three-minute moment of silence to mourn the revolutionary martyrs who had died. The entire venue was solemn. Afterwards, he read a telegram from Henan Province, stating that the breaching point at the Huayuankou of the Yellow River had been closed, and the completion was joyfully announced at dawn on the 15th. Upon hearing the news, the entire venue erupted in warm applause, rejoicing for the hundreds of thousands of disaster victims.</p>
<p>(7) The Director-General did not personally attend the conference today. Yesterday, he walked into the chairman's platform wearing a khaki Zhongshan suit with a smiling face. Seeing the Kuomintang completing the work of returning power to the people, he seemed to have infinite comfort in his heart. Today, Jing Hengyi wore a skullcap without a crown, resembling a Turk. Ju Zheng's small Uyghur-style hat and Ding Weifen's peculiar hat were quite eye-catching.</p>
<p>(8) From the Second Plenary Session to the Third Plenary Session, a year has passed. Many comrades in the Party have gained more white hair. Looking around, the hair is frosty, and it seems that there are more Central Committee members with white hair than with black hair. However, the whiteness of each person's hair is different. Shao Lizi has a head full of white hair; Chen Cheng and Chen Lifu have white temples but their crowns are still gray; Chen Shuren has a mix of black and white; Zhang Zhiben has white hair in the front but still has black hair in the back; Bai Chongxi and Bai Yunti, although their surname is Bai, have no white hair.</p>
<p>(9) The drafting committee for the declaration immediately nominated Sun Ke, Dai Chuanxian, Chen Bulei, Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, Pan Gongzhan, Luo Jialun, Cheng Zhonghang, and Hong Lanyou, a total of nine people. Today, Li Weiguo, Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, and Huang Shaogu, President of the Heping Daily News, were added. Both Li and Huang are standing directors of the Youth League and have been in the Party for many years. They are mature beyond their years and are suitable to shoulder this important task.</p>

<h3>Marshall Has Resolutely Rejected Suggestions for Out-of-Conference Discussions on the China Issue, Indicates Possible Consideration if the Soviet Side Raises the Issue of Stationing Troops</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch] Washington, 16th Broadcast: It is learned that Marshall has resolutely rejected out-of-conference discussions on China's internal affairs in the Soviet capital, but indicated that if Molotov raises the issue of the US and Soviet Union stationing troops within China, he would consider it separately.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 15th Dispatch] As of late tonight, Marshall has still not responded to the Soviet Foreign Minister's letter regarding the China issue.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 15th Dispatch] Bevin must wait for instructions from his own government before giving an affirmative response to Molotov's suggestion. However, in any case, his opposition to discussing the China issue in a manner exceeding the exchange of opinions will not change. He maintained this position during the Moscow discussions in 1945.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 15th Dispatch] Marshall and Bevin are carefully reconsidering Molotov's suggestion in light of China's opposition to participating. Furthermore, the two are quite busy during their stay in Moscow, so it is unlikely that they will place the China issue as a top priority. Bevin has even declared that if such a meeting is held, it should be limited to reviewing the implementation of the 1949 agreements. Bevin also guaranteed that he would not discuss Far Eastern issues before exchanging views with the various autonomous territories. It is believed here that Molotov may withdraw the suggestion. Surprisingly, even Chinese left-wing elements who have always sympathized with the Soviet Union have taken a unified step with Chinese right-wing elements to oppose discussing the China issue here.</p>

<h3>Americans Understand Our Country, Friendship with China Has Not Wavered, US China Service Society Announces Results of Public Opinion Survey</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 15th Dispatch] According to the results of a public opinion survey released by the United Service to China (American relief organization for China), the civil war and political turmoil in China have not shaken the traditional friendship of the United States with the Chinese people. The results of a national Gallup survey indicate that two-thirds of the American people believe that it is important for the United States to continue to aid China, and half of them even believe that assistance to China is "extremely important." The above-mentioned national survey was conducted by the Gallup Poll Organization at the request of the United Service to China. At the same time, another public opinion survey organization also conducted a public opinion survey in the city of Boston in Pennsylvania to investigate the opinions of local people on China. Three-quarters of the people believe that the United States should be concerned about the welfare of the people of other countries, and generally express the greatest concern for China. The results of the public opinion survey in the city show that most Americans believe that Chinese people need educational opportunities more than anything else. They do not believe in the previous belief that China is overly bound by its old ideas and cannot obtain the benefits of education. Seventy percent of them said that they would personally help the Chinese people to obtain this opportunity. The above two surveys were conducted during the news reports of the US reporters stationed in China about the civil war and political turmoil in China and a small number of people holding anti-American parades. Former Secretary of State and current Chairman of the United Service to China, Stettinius, praised the results of the survey, calling it "another demonstration of the basic common sense of the American people." Stettinius also said: The survey has provided concrete proof that even when we learn of extremely chaotic and depressing reports, the American people understand the importance of maintaining friendly concern for the Chinese people.</p>

<h3>After the Announcement of the New Economic Program, Prices in Various Regions Have Tended to Stabilize</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] After the announcement of the economic emergency measures program, various regions across the country are implementing them vigorously. According to reports from various regions to the Executive Yuan, prices have generally tended to stabilize.</p>
<p>Yunnan</p>
<p>The report of February 22 stated that after the implementation of the program, gold shops immediately closed down, foreign currency was no longer in circulation, and in terms of prices, compared with early February, not only did they not rise, but there was also a downward trend.</p>
<p>Hubei</p>
<p>The report of February 22 stated that in the ten days before the program was promulgated, prices rose by an average of about 50%. After the implementation of the program, prices stopped rising and there was a downward trend, and the market gradually stabilized.</p>
<p>Tianjin</p>
<p>Before the promulgation of the program, the market was extremely unstable due to the influence of the gold rush in Shanghai. After a meeting was held on February 5, an emergency measures program to stabilize prices was decided, stipulating the investigation and prohibition of the gold and silver black market, supervision of the grain market, control of yarn and cloth transactions, and prohibition of commercial banks and money houses from engaging in the habit of operating in gold, silver, yarn, cloth, and grain, or using them as loan collateral. The market was slightly stabilized. After the promulgation of the program, gold and silver still had no price, and the black market disappeared. In terms of prices, yarn and cloth were stable, grain prices were weak, and general prices, except for export goods that had increased due to the influence of foreign exchange adjustments, there were few fluctuations in other daily necessities.</p>
<p>Jiangsu</p>
<p>After the implementation of the program, prices have tended to fall. Qianjiang rice fell from 100,000 yuan per stone to 80,000 yuan, and other counties have also tended to fall.</p>
<p>Beiping</p>
<p>The report of March 2 stated that before the program was promulgated, in early February, due to the volatility of the gold rush in Shanghai and the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, the price of gold was higher than in other parts of the country, and prices soared accordingly. After taking expedient measures on February 6 to stop gold transactions and control the general market, although the black market was not eradicated, the price of gold had fallen, and the economy tended to stabilize. After the implementation of the program, the gold and silver black market disappeared, and in terms of prices, no hoarding or speculation of daily necessities or violation of price limits was found. General prices gradually stabilized, and the prices of rice and wheat food generally fell by 10% to 15%. The price of coal and grain had not increased by the end of February. However, recently, due to the collection and purchase of grain in Chahar, Suiyuan, Jehol, and Liaoning, the prohibition of external transportation, and the dissolution of the Mentougou Coal Mine Trade Union by the Wanping County Government, coal transportation was suspended, and the supply and demand were unbalanced, causing the price of coal and grain to rise slightly.</p>
<p>Qingdao</p>
<p>The report of February 27 stated that after the implementation of the program, prices have been affected by the military situation in central Shandong. In recent days, the prices of daily necessities have soared and have not fallen. Wheat flour is still around 70,000 yuan, rice is between 1,000 and 1,200 yuan per catty, and coal dust is at an unstable price of over 11,000 yuan per hundred catties.</p>

After the implementation of the program, prices have tended to fall. Gold and silver jewelry shops in Hangzhou have closed down, and there is no black market. In terms of wages, the salaries of employees have not been paid according to the cost of living index. Currently, as prices have tended to stabilize, there have been no incidents of factory closures, strikes, or absenteeism.</p>
<p>Sichuan</p>
<p>The report of March 3 stated that prices have tended to fall since the implementation of the program.</p>
<p>Anhui</p>
<p>The report of March 3 stated that before the program was promulgated, prices had once soared due to economic volatility. Gold rose from 45 million yuan to 1 million yuan per tael, rice rose from 40,000 yuan to 80,000 yuan per dan, firewood rose from 5,000 yuan to 15,000 yuan per hundred catties, vegetable oil rose from 1,000 yuan to 2,400 yuan per catty, kerosene rose from 500 yuan to 3,200 yuan per catty, and cloth generally rose by more than double.

<h3>The Resumption of Civil Aviation</h3>
<p>After a two-month suspension, the China and Central Aviation Companies have resumed flights yesterday. Four aircraft departed from Shanghai, and three from Nanjing. Due to repeated aircraft accidents, passengers are cautious, so patronage has not been very enthusiastic. Although this matter is a minor one, its significance is very great, and it concerns the future of our country's aviation industry, which deserves our attention. Since the establishment of civil aviation companies in our country, people from all walks of life have had much to say. The main points are nothing more than mismanagement, poor equipment, poor communication, or smuggling, dereliction of duty, and arrogant attitudes on the part of flight crews, leading to frequent overload, damage, and accidents. The media has repeatedly called for improving civil aviation to ensure passenger safety, but human effort has not been reduced, and ultimately, the effectiveness of overcoming nature through human effort has not been achieved. In recent months, shocking aircraft accidents have been frequently seen, creating an unprecedented disaster for our country's aviation industry. After continuous disasters, the government established the Civil Aviation Administration to strengthen the control of civil aviation. For the internal reorganization of the Central and China Aviation Companies, flights on all routes were suspended for about two months, and resumed only yesterday.</p>
<p>The activities of the transportation industry are like the blood vessels of the human body, which need to circulate and cannot stagnate, causing the phenomenon of obesity and paralysis. Now that the Central Aviation Company has resumed flights and air transportation is active, it is a welcome event, but there is still doubt as to whether the internal reorganization and aircraft equipment are completely satisfactory. Therefore, we still have unlimited concerns about the progress of the civil aviation industry in the future.</p>
<p>Aviation is a combination of scientific tools, which must be combined with scientific management to achieve its inherent performance. At the same time, scientific equipment is changing with each passing day, and high technology must be adopted at any time to achieve daily progress. The China and Central Aviation Companies in our country already have a considerable history in the civil aviation industry, and their organization and capital are extremely strong. During the Anti-Japanese War in the rear area, they made good contributions. However, after the post-war recovery, it is regrettable that the Ministry of Communications neglected management and the company's organization and personnel were not adequately rationalized. After the three aircraft accidents in Shanghai last Christmas, the Ministry of Communications established the Civil Aviation Administration. In recent months, the work of the Civil Aviation Administration, such as enriching meteorological equipment, special preventative measures to ensure aviation safety, and adjusting the supervision, maintenance, and management personnel of the Central and China Aviation Companies, have all been progressive manifestations, which are barely satisfactory. However, after repeated aircraft accidents, the Control Yuan and the Senate successively published investigation reports, and the case of the China Aviation Company's No. 145 Shanghai-Chongqing flight crashing in Tianmen, western Hubei, even involved the alleged smuggling of 200 gold bars, causing the aircraft to lose balance and suffer this tragedy. To this day, the families of the victims of each tragedy are still filing lawsuits, without any results, and are left to lament helplessly. In theory, the transportation authorities should make a clear announcement of the causes of past aircraft accidents after the resumption of flights to dispel public doubts. The appeals of the bereaved families should not be dismissed with a document expressing condolences to the victims, and the past should not be glossed over! In fact, the responsibility for the airline's accidents should be clarified, and the grievances of the bereaved families should be redressed. This is how it should be done administratively, it should also be done in terms of a sense of responsibility, and it should be done even more so morally!</p>
<p>As for the improvement of the civil aviation industry in the future, the scientific and technical aspects depend on the exploration of experts, while the investigation reports of the Controllers and Senators contain many improvement suggestions, which are all very important. Now, during the resumption of flights by the Central Aviation Company, we would like to express our views as a supplement to the improvement suggestions of all parties, hoping that the relevant parties will refer to them: (1) There should be a civil aviation law concerning navigation, responsibility, compensation, and pensions in the civil aviation industry. This is a kind of social security legislation, which seems necessary in our country today; (2) The fare after the resumption of flights should not be increased, but the insurance premium or the company's additional insurance premium can be increased. Due to the increase in insurance premiums, the company's articles of association should also increase the amount of compensation for passengers, which should not be too different from the compensation for company employees, and especially should not be different from the compensation for foreign passengers, so as to avoid the suspicion of treating the lives of domestic passengers as worthless. The increase in life insurance premiums can also increase the company's prudence; (3) Prepare in advance for everything, the company should have sufficient parachutes and life belts, and teach passengers the safe use of technology in advance to reduce the danger in case of emergency; (4) The aviation traffic inspection system should be restored to prevent aircraft or passengers from carrying gold and contraband, so as to ensure the safety of the journey; (5) Civil aviation and military aircraft should have flight agreements, such as regulations on the flight altitude of round-trip routes, and allowing civil aircraft to land at military airports in emergencies. All of this will not only help ensure passenger safety, but also remedy the defects in the social security and relief system of our country's civil aviation in its infancy.</p>
<p>In short, our country's civil aviation industry is currently in a critical stage. If it lags behind, it must make progress, and it can go one step further. Clear the clouds and see the blue sky. The future of national construction is very far-reaching. At this moment, when the country is facing difficult times, the nation's vitality and the aviation industry's vitality cannot withstand any more setbacks!</p>
<h3>Commentary on the Method of Wage Assessment</h3>
<p>The Method of Implementing Wage Assessment has been passed by the National Economic Commission's Price Committee. The full text contains fourteen articles. Its purpose is nothing more than to replace the quantitative distribution of employees with appropriate compensation. The Executive Yuan has designated only Beijing and Shanghai as places where prices are strictly controlled. In these two cities, all salaries and wages calculated according to the cost of living index shall be based on the highest amount in January of this year, and a flat-rate allocation of six kinds of daily necessities shall be provided as a subsidy. Although the cost of living index in other important cities has also been frozen, the quantitative distribution of daily necessities has not been implemented, so it is necessary to make appropriate adjustments to show fairness. Read the first article of this method, which excludes the places designated by the Executive Yuan for strict price control, and the price of the six kinds of rice, coal, oil, salt, cotton cloth, and sugar, which are used to increase or decrease wages as stipulated in Article 6, is exactly the same as the flat-rate goods currently distributed to employees, and its meaning is self-evident.</p>
<p>What needs to be pointed out here is that the method of quantitative distribution is more fixed and uniform, while the method of wage assessment is quite flexible, and there are gains and losses in its application. Although the actual distribution of goods in Shanghai is not enough to meet the urgent needs, the price difference has already been converted into cash, which in fact is not much different from the discretionary wage increase. However, the price difference is calculated based on the retail market price, which is completely mechanical, and is ultimately different from the wages after assessment. Because once it is assessed, there will be room for flexibility. Article 6 clearly states: "The assessment of wage increases or decreases shall be based on the detailed situation of the prices of major daily necessities in the local area at that time, and shall be reported to the local government for approval." Article 7 also states: "When implementing wage assessment, close contact should be made with neighboring areas." If it is purely mechanical, like the flat-rate distribution of goods or the conversion of price differences into cash, then the words "assessment," "approval," and "contact" would not be applicable.</p>
<p>When prices are stable, it is not bad to adopt a mechanical subsidy method or a flexible one. When prices fluctuate sharply, it seems theoretically more convenient to adopt the latter, i.e., the assessment method. Because the cost of living index at the bottom has been frozen, and the quantitative distribution of subsidies remains unchanged, it is really difficult to say whether it can be fully implemented in practice.</p>
<p>However, there is also an important point to note in the assessment method, that is, the proviso in Article 8 of the original plan: "No changes shall be made before approval." This is based on the precedent of all price negotiations, and a general rule has been discovered, that is, the black market comes before the negotiated price. In other words, the black market leads the negotiated price, and the negotiated price follows the black market. This has created a phenomenon that there is a black market whenever there is a negotiated price. Wages are different from prices, and theoretically they do not support the creation of a black market. However, if the negotiated price is not very reasonable, or is not decided for a long time, so that labor and management have to find a way to reach an agreement on their own, then it is no different from a black market. Furthermore, the failure to reassess in a timely manner when "prices change, and the cost of living increases or decreases too drastically" will make it impossible to reduce labor unrest, which is especially inconsistent with the intention of this legislation. Therefore, when implementing this wage assessment method, it is necessary to always stand on a proactive position, and especially to grasp the timeliness, so as to avoid the above-mentioned abuses.</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of the Emergency Economic Measures Program, whether wages and prices can be coordinated has been a major concern. Now, the measures for the distribution of daily necessities, the measures for converting price differences into cash, and the measures for implementing wage assessment have been formulated one after another, and the legislative work can be said to have been completed. The central task from now on is of course how to stabilize prices, and to achieve the elimination of labor unrest and the stabilization of workers' lives, it is especially important to properly use these methods.</p>

<h3>Contradictions Found in the Potsdam Agreement; Bevin Believes They Should Be Corrected; Marshall to Meet with Stalin Soon</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 15th] Foreign Minister Bevin has initiated the correction of contradictions in the Potsdam Agreement regarding Germany at the Council of Foreign Ministers to meet the needs of the current situation. Bevin believes that the principles of the Potsdam Agreement need to be redefined, but this work must be based on the entire agreement and not be treated individually. The principle of economic unification is the most important principle of the Potsdam Agreement, but although the four powers recognize this principle, they still act independently in its implementation. Britain has made it clear that it will object to the execution of other provisions until the four powers have reached an agreement on the execution of this provision. Although Bevin and Molotov have exchanged accusations in the meetings, they both possess a high degree of diplomatic skill, so the door to compromise is not closed. Marshall, as a newcomer to the Council of Foreign Ministers, has received general praise for his prudence. Take Molotov's suggestion to discuss the China issue as an example. Marshall encountered this unexpected problem at the beginning of the meeting, but he did not move a muscle and waited for Bevin to propose an informal discussion, which eased the atmosphere.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 15th] Experienced observers in Moscow today expect the U.S. Secretary of State and other foreign ministers to be summoned to the Kremlin to meet with Premier Stalin. This rumor is consistent with the arguments of Republican Senators in the United States, who are urging Marshall to express the U.S. policy in the Mediterranean to the Soviet leader.</p>
<h3>Sixth Day of the Council of Foreign Ministers: Discussing the Displacement of Refugees and Land Division</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 15th Special Dispatch] The sixth day of the meeting of the four foreign ministers was chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Marshall, and the meeting lasted for four hours and fifteen minutes. The themes discussed today were the displacement of people and the re-division of territory. Vyshinsky first reported on the external representative work of the discussion on the German peace treaty, stating that the foreign ministers' representatives were currently in a stalemate on the issue of whether to invite Albania to participate in the consultative meeting. British Foreign Secretary Bevin then proposed that although no agreement could be reached on the issue of Albania, the work of the foreign ministers' representatives should continue. After discussion, this suggestion was endorsed by all the foreign ministers. Vyshinsky then made a lengthy statement on the fact that some Soviet citizens were still living in concentration camps. Marshall explained the U.S. position and suggested that this issue be handled by the International Refugee Organization. The International Refugee Organization was established to solve such serious problems, and if the Four Foreign Ministers' Council tried to interfere in this matter, it would not only be of no help, but would also make the matter more complicated. French Foreign Minister Bidault spoke for the first time during the discussion of the issue of displaced persons and made a very significant suggestion. He believed that since the population density within the country was already higher than other countries, (1) German minorities outside Germany should be prohibited from entering Germany; (2) The transfer of the German population decided at the Potsdam Conference should be temporarily suspended; (3) Displaced persons should not reside in Germany; (4) An agency should be organized to handle German emigration. Bidault also stated that France was prepared to fulfill its responsibility to accommodate Germans. Regarding the issue of prejudice against Germany in European countries, Bidault's suggestions were even more statesmanlike.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of redefining borders, Molotov read a report, and Marshall immediately explained that the re-division of the border in the U.S. occupation zone was based on historical, economic, and cultural considerations. Molotov suggested that the Allied Control Council should approve future border changes. However, Bevin believed that the Allied Control Council was unlikely to reach an agreement on such matters. Molotov wanted to ask the Council of Foreign Ministers to make this decision, but no one agreed to his suggestion. The first week of the Four Foreign Ministers' Council ended in this way. In the first week of the Four Foreign Ministers' Council, only one resolution was reached, namely the liquidation of the Prussian state. The next meeting of the foreign ministers will be held at 4 p.m. on the 17th of this month, and is scheduled to discuss the economic principles and reparations issues proposed by Molotov.</p>
<p>Displaced Persons Can Be Classified into Four Categories</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 15th Special Dispatch] British Foreign Minister Bevin, in discussing the issue of displaced persons, divided them into four categories: (1) prisoners of war; (2) displaced persons of the United Nations; (3) displaced persons of enemy countries; and (4) German refugees and deportees. The second category is the most difficult. Two million people have returned home from the British occupation zone, and there are currently 230,000 people, the most numerous and worrying of whom are 111,000 Poles, followed by 82,500 people from the Baltic states, 4,700 Yugoslavs, more than 7,800 prisoners of war, and 29,000 people of various nationalities who have not yet been identified, but are considered to be people of the United Nations. The policy of the Council of Foreign Ministers is not to force them to return home, but to use other methods to speed up their resettlement elsewhere, but they are not allowed to stay in Germany permanently, and currently they are being used for productive work.</p>
<h3>British and American Foreign Ministers Confer on the Palestine Issue</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 15th] According to unofficial sources: British Foreign Minister Bevin and U.S. Secretary of State Marshall have discussed the Palestine issue at length in Moscow. Bevin told Marshall that the United States could no longer evade its moral responsibility for solving the Jewish problem. It is reported that the Palestine issue is being discussed simultaneously in Washington, London, and Moscow. Regarding the proposal by the British to organize a committee on the Palestine issue by major countries, it is reported that the representatives of China, France, and the Soviet Union have expressed their support, and the United States has no objection either.</p>
<h3>New U.S. Ambassador to Britain Arrives in London to Take Office</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 16th] The new U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Douglas, arrived here today to take office. He must wait for King George VI to return from South Africa before he can present his credentials.</p>
<h3>Rumor Has It That According to Truman's Aid Plan, the U.S. Will Lend Us 500 Million Yuan; Total Foreign Loans Reach Over 5.7 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 15th] The "Army and Navy Journal" predicted today that China and several other countries will receive U.S. financial assistance under Truman's aid plan. The entire aid plan will cost approximately 5.75 billion yuan, and China may receive the largest share, amounting to 500 million yuan. According to its editor, a close friend of General Marshall, the total amount of U.S. foreign aid may reach 5.75 billion yuan, distributed as follows: Greece and Turkey will receive a total of 400 million yuan, China will receive 500 million yuan, Korea will receive 200 million yuan, Austria will receive 155 million yuan, the Balkan countries will receive 200 million yuan, Germany will receive 475 million yuan, and Japan and other Pacific regions will receive 200 million yuan. Truman made the decision on a large-scale aid plan after learning of the factual reports of the Army, Navy, and Air Force advisors, General Marshall, and other experts. Some call this plan the Monroe Doctrine of the world, and others call it the New Lend-Lease Act. The president's proposal will inevitably interfere with the freedom of all places. It is said that the total amount of the figures expected to be obtained by the aforementioned countries is less than 5.75 billion yuan, and the newspaper did not explain the reason. It is thought that the countries it listed are only part of the aid target.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 16th] The Egyptian government has decided to extend the Anglo-Egyptian trade agreement for one year, starting from the 1st of this month.</p>
<h3>The Door to Compromise on the Straits Question Closed for Turkey: Views of Turkish Political Figures</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 15th] Regarding the Dardanelles Straits issue, political figures here stated: As far as Turkey is concerned, the door to reaching a compromise has already been closed. Considering President Truman's statement on foreign policy to Congress, the hope of the Soviet Union obtaining a solution that satisfies its desires appears slim. Therefore, the Dardanelles Straits will likely maintain the status quo. Turkish figures generally expressed satisfaction and approval regarding President Truman's foreign policy statement. However, the "Ulus" newspaper, which is semi-official and authoritative in public opinion, held a slightly different view. Diplomatic figures here paid close attention to this. According to an article published in the newspaper by a well-known economist, "Although American consideration of financially assisting Turkey is very important, it cannot solve everything. Only the restoration of world security can allow Turkey to revive its economy."</p>
<h3>U.S. Economic Aid Plan for Greece Is Not Interference in Greek Internal Affairs: State Department Official Willard Declares</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 15th] The U.S. State Department released its weekly "Our Country's Foreign Policy" broadcast tonight, with Deputy Director of the Middle East Division Willard speaking, saying: We do not intend to interfere in Greece's internal affairs, nor do we intend to have any political party in power while suppressing another. We do intend to economically assist Greece, so that the Greek people can maintain the government they desire in an atmosphere free from threats.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 15th] The legislative draft for implementing President Truman's aid plan for Greece and Turkey is reportedly complete and will be submitted to the House of Representatives by Eaton, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, on Monday. Congressional authorities stated: The draft does not specifically limit the method of assistance but will adopt a method similar to the wartime Lend-Lease program, with payments made in installments. This measure will allow the United States to send economic and military missions to Greece and will transfer surplus military materials to Greece and Turkey. Regular army and navy equipment may also be supplied to the two countries. The nature of the military missions will be similar to the U.S. military missions sent to South America and China, but the deployment of U.S. troops will not become a reality.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] Republican Senator Taft today raised the question of whether the Soviet Union would declare war if the United States provided financial and military aid to Greece and Turkey, and demanded that the government express its opinion. It is said: "I want to know how our senior military officials feel about the possibility of the Soviet Union waging war if the United States implements this plan. If the Soviet Union wanted to forcibly establish a communist government in Cuba, we would almost certainly go to war, and the situation would be exactly the same."</p>
<p>Representatives of Greek Parties Send Telegrams of Thanks to U.S. President</p>
<p>On the day Taft raised the question, the White House announced telegrams of thanks from spokespersons of all Greek parties, except the Communist Party. The presidential announcement stated that these telegrams proved that all parties wanted unreserved cooperation with the United States, guaranteeing a commitment to constructive revival and loyalty to the principles of peace and freedom.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 16th] The leader of the American economic delegation stationed in Greece, is expected to arrive here today from Athens to confer with government officials on the matter of loans to Greece.</p>
<h3>Truman Fishes, Receives Two Secret Letters from Marshall</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 15th] President Truman is apparently pleased that his aid proposal for Greece and Turkey will be passed and will continue his vacation here until the 19th. The lack of an official response from Moscow and the excitement in Congress are factors in the president's decision to take a temporary vacation, according to authoritative sources. Today, before embarking on a four-hour fishing trip, the president received two secret letters from Secretary of State Marshall. The letters were delivered by airmail, the first time since Truman addressed Congress on the 12th. Marshall was fully informed of Truman's address to Congress beforehand, but the two have not had telephone contact since. Presidential spokesperson Rose announced that, barring any changes, Truman will remain in Key West for several more days after the 17th.</p>
<h3>McNutt Extends Return to U.S.</h3>
<p>Three More Agreements Between U.S. and Philippines Pending Signature</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 15th] U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Paul McNutt was originally scheduled to return to the United States this morning but has now extended his stay until the 17th or 18th to await the signing of three other agreements between the U.S. and the Philippines, including military aid and an extradition agreement. Yesterday, McNutt and President Roxas signed a military base treaty, a consular agreement, and a fisheries agreement here.</p>
<h3>Democratic Front Unites to Create Peace: Ambassador Koo's Insightful Speech</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 16th Broadcast: Chinese Ambassador to the United States V.K. Wellington Koo gave a speech at the University of Virginia, saying: "There is no doubt that democracy will triumph over other ideologies. Peace is indivisible, and so are world prosperity and freedom. If nations cannot cooperate, the international future will be bleak and regrettable. The world situation is complex due to the existence of two opposing ideologies. Countries take different steps on certain issues, making cooperation difficult. Only mutual understanding can lead to cooperation. The world democratic front must unite and act together. The power of unity is greatest when democratic forces unite, because the foundation of democratic forces is the free will of the individual, not the forced will of the state."</p>
<h3>Franco-Bulgarian Relations Deteriorate: France Recalls Envoy to Bulgaria</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 15th] Officials announced today: The French government has decided to halt trade negotiations with Bulgaria and ordered two Bulgarian journalists to leave the country within 24 hours, in retaliation for Bulgaria's expulsion of French journalist Madame Bouillot. This action is not an infringement on press freedom. The accreditation of other Bulgarian correspondents in France will not be renewed upon expiration, and Bulgarian journalists will not enjoy the various conveniences afforded to other foreign journalists, but diplomatic relations between the two countries will not be severed. The French Envoy to Bulgaria, Mr. Paris, has been recalled to report on various incidents last week, including Bulgaria's interference in the French Embassy's deposits. Bulgaria recently issued a new currency and froze the old currency, limiting the circulation of the old currency to 2,000 units per person, with any excess subject to interference, thus causing the incident.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 15th] A spokesperson for the French Foreign Ministry stated that the Bulgarian Envoy to Paris left Paris this afternoon to return to Sofia, presumably with instructions from his government, and he may not return to Paris.</p>
<h3>Anti-Government Faction Active in Spain: Franco's Police Crack Down on Secret Organizations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Zaragoza, 16th] According to an announcement by Spanish authorities today: The Spanish government has cracked down on an "insurrection plot" by anarchists and socialists. The organization allegedly attempted to paralyze the industry of Catalonia by blowing up the power plant near the Utrillas coal mine. In Madrid, police also raided an organization, arresting 122 members suspected of being terrorists and killing two of their leaders. In Barcelona, three people were arrested on suspicion of throwing grenades at a store. It was also reported that conspirators had blown up a railway bridge between Bilbao and Barcelona, but the incident was discovered before a train passed. However, authorities refused to disclose how many people were arrested in the alleged insurrection plot.</p>
<h3>Bastions of Defense Against the Soviets: A Look at the Political Situation in Greece and Turkey</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Reporter Wang Gongda, Ankara, 15th Dispatch] This Central News Agency reporter has found that Greece and Turkey are important links in today's anti-Soviet bulwark, but their situations are very different. The reporter stayed in Turkey for several days and visited Greece in mid-February this year, and obtained the above views. Some observers share the same view with the reporter.</p>
<p>The Turkish Government Is Strong and Powerful</p>
<p>Today's Turkey has a strong and powerful government and follows the policies clearly defined by Kemal Ataturk, just as China follows the policies of the Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen. When the Turkish people follow certain policies, they have a Muslim spirit, ignoring all domestic and foreign criticisms and resolutely implementing the policies. The political and military situation in Turkey is stable. Although Kemal Ataturk has been dead for ten years, his closest comrade, the current President Inönü, is still following his aspirations, just as President Chiang Kai-shek is following Dr. Sun Yat-sen's aspirations.</p>
<p>Greece Currently Lacks Leaders</p>
<p>Presently, Greece has virtually no national leaders to speak of. King George of Greece is not Greek at all. The Greek royal family has constantly intermarried with European royal families and has German, Danish, and Russian blood. Since ascending the throne in 1910, King George has been exiled once by a public referendum and has been invited back to the country twice by public referendum. Greek Prime Minister Maximos is a banker who once served as the president of the Bank of Greece. He does not belong to any party and is not even a political figure. He was appointed Prime Minister simply because he can coordinate the eight political parties in the Greek parliament. The prominent Athenian politician, Tsaldaris, the current Greek Foreign Minister, is merely the leader of the most powerful right-wing party. He did not leave when the Axis powers occupied Greece and was still an unknown figure before the war. There is even less to speak of in terms of the prestige of a leader. Greek intellectuals told the reporter: "Unfortunately, we cannot get a leader like your President Chiang Kai-shek." Today's Greek government is indeed weak and incompetent. The Turkish government and military can prevent any actions suspected of left-wing disturbances in advance. Greece is not. Despite having American heavy weapons, British aircraft, and even ready-made British-style uniforms, its army is clearly insufficient to prevent communist harassment. This can be proved by the failure of its full-scale annihilation war in mid-February.</p>
<p>Current Economic Status of Turkey and Greece</p>
<p>The national economies of Turkey and Greece have been shaken, but the circumstances of the shaking are also different. One U.S. dollar is worth 2.8 Turkish liras, but one U.S. dollar can be exchanged for 5,000 Greek drachmas. Turkey is exhausting its national resources to support its million-strong army for defense against foreign aggression and is gritting its teeth and enduring suffering. Greece, however, relies on foreign countries for everything, and prices are extremely high, and the black market is rampant. The Greeks allow communists to even conduct propaganda and demonstrations in their capital, but Ankara would never allow such a phenomenon to occur. Greece can at most show the world that it is "democratic," even though it is bleeding in fact to quell armed rebellion. Turkey will never relax its strict suppression work and will not consider the comments of other countries in the world. But strangely, the comments received by the two countries are both "fascism."</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Slavic Criticism</p>
<p>The criticism Turkey receives from the Slavs is even less than that of Greece, and the criticism of Turkey from democratic countries is also far less than that of Greece. Turkey is successful in this regard because it has adopted extremely realistic policies. Greece is not; it is suffering from the contradiction between its realistic and idealistic policies.</p>
<p>Friendship Between Greece and Turkey Eliminates Old Grudges</p>
<p>Greece and Turkey had considerable old grudges in the past, but they have eliminated them in the past 25 years. Since the end of World War II, Greece and Turkey have been as close as long-time allies due to their common interest in jointly defending against Soviet aggression. After Truman delivered his speech on granting loans to Greece and Turkey, relations between the two countries became even closer. Western countries now call Greece and Turkey "the borders of democracy." The Turks believe that they are the boiling point of the U.S.-Soviet conflict. The Turks believe that their homeland is the bulwark preventing the "red tide" in the entire Middle East. The Turks believe that their army today, although not comparable to the United States, is undoubtedly the most powerful in the Middle East, and the Turkish government is undoubtedly the strongest in all the countries of the Middle East and the Near East. Due to the same interests, Greece and Turkey have now become a major anti-Soviet fortress in the Middle East. The Turkish government newspaper "Milliyet" believes that this matter "has the most important relationship to the peace and security of the world," so Greece and Turkey should now receive American aid at the same time.</p>
<p>The Status of the Two Countries Is Extremely Important</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the "sanitary belt" to prevent Soviet aggression starts from the Baltic Sea, passes through the eastern part of the Jutland Peninsula, winds to the port of Trieste, then along the Adriatic Sea, crosses northern Greece, the Black Sea, Iran, India, and central Korea at 38 degrees north latitude, and then along the Bering Sea to the Arctic Ocean. From this point of view, Greece and Turkey do occupy an important position in this anti-Soviet bulwark.</p>
<h3>Nehru Proposes Partition to Resolve Punjab Dispute: Muslim League Opposes, Demands New Elections</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lahore, 16th] Well-informed sources here say that a new dispute is likely to arise between the Congress Party and the Muslim League regarding Nehru's plan to divide the Punjab province into two regions. It is reported that Nehru has informed the Governor of Punjab, Sir Evan Jenkins, that the Congress Party will ask the Viceroy of India, Lord Mountbatten, to take office as soon as possible so that the province can be divided into two regions. Muslim League President Jinnah is reportedly opposed to this, believing that this move will economically harm the independent Muslim state after the partition, as the Punjab is the economic pillar of the Northwest Frontier Province and Sindh. Therefore, many believe that the Muslim League will demand new elections in the province to determine its future.</p>

<h3>Japanese Parliament to Be Re-Elected Next Month: Hirohito Ineligible to Vote</h3>
<p>Matsudaira Tsuneo to Be Leader of the Liberal Party</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 15th] The Japanese parliament will be re-elected next month, and Emperor Hirohito will not be able to vote, but other members of the royal family may be able to vote.

<h3>Yang Yongqing Urges Implementation of Children's Fund Plan</h3>

<h3>Former British War Minister Pelly Says British and American Naval Power Are Related</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Birmingham, England, 15th] Former British War Minister Pelly said in a speech here today that President Truman's speech on aid to Greece and Turkey shows that the United States itself has clearly declared its Mediterranean maritime status. Truman's doctrine should not be seen as taking over Britain's power and sovereignty. On the contrary, it recognizes that Britain relinquishing its responsibilities on the seven seas is an unduly heavy burden. If Britain and the United States want to promote a common policy in fulfilling maritime obligations, then it is only right that they share the responsibility for implementation. The interconnection of British and American diplomacy gives the greatest factual guarantee to world peace. The Anglo-French treaty will soon be aligned with the format that is being formed. Such unity between maritime powers will not only not undermine the world peace organization but will also consolidate its foundation.</p>
<h3>Arab Countries to Recognize Indonesia</h3>

Formal steps to recognize Indonesia will be taken soon.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 16th] The Paraguayan Chargé d'Affaires in Argentina, Morinigo, brother of the President, recently announced that the situation in the country is normal everywhere except in Concepción, where the rebels are located, and that the rebellion can be suppressed immediately.

<h3>Tragic Accident on the Songhu Railway: Train and Truck Collide Violently; Negligence of the Crossing Guard Causes Disaster; Nine People Including Soldiers and Police Injured</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Yesterday evening at 6:45 PM, at the intersection of the Songhu Railway and Yixian Road, half a kilometer from the Jiangwan Station, a tragic accident occurred in which a train and a truck collided. The truck overturned, and nine people were injured on the spot, including several with life-threatening injuries. The Dongmao Transportation Motor Vehicle Company, driven by driver Zhang Renxue, drove truck number 36765 from the North Railway Station to Wusong at around 5:50 PM yesterday afternoon, carrying many passengers. In the middle of the journey, more than 20 soldiers from the machine gun platoon and sanitation team of the 3rd Company of the 4th Regiment of the 2nd Brigade of the Youth Army 202nd Division requested a ride. Driver Zhang Xue仁 could not persuade them, so they all climbed on. When it reached Yixian Road (formerly known as Wai Ma Road) in Jiangwan, the road was rugged, and the truck body kept shaking. At the intersection of the railway and the road, one of the soldiers, Chen Dexing, was seriously injured by the impact. Traffic police officer Ye Zhangshi, number 2294, arrived upon hearing the report and ordered the driver and the truck to be taken to the Jiangwan Branch Bureau for investigation. After much negotiation, the truck was turned back to the Jiangwan Branch Bureau. It was 6:45 PM, and it was already dark. A train from Hejiawan Station to Shanghai happened to be arriving at the location. Crossing guard Zhong Baoxiang was negligent and did not lower the signal pole. At this time, the truck driven by Zhang Xue仁 was running at full speed, intending to cross the tracks, but could not brake in time and collided with the rear half of the train engine, causing it to overturn. The train was slightly shaken and continued on its way. The truck overturned, and the passengers fell to the ground. Five people were seriously injured, with blood and flesh blurred, and were unconscious. Later, ambulances from the police and fire department arrived and sent them to the Railway Hospital. One person who was slightly injured was also sent to the Railway Hospital. Two people were sent to the Police Hospital. Another person was sent to the Fourth Municipal Hospital for treatment. The complete list of injured is as follows: (1) Sent to the Railway Hospital: Chen Dexing (most seriously injured), Zhu Yaozu, Wang Kang, Cao Ming, Zhou Zhirong (slightly injured). (All of the above are soldiers from the sanitation team of the Youth Army 202nd Division). Ye Huanyu (communication soldier of the 1st Battalion of the 202nd Division). (2) Sent to the Police Hospital: Ye Zhangting, Zhang Xueren. (3) Sent to the Fourth Municipal Hospital: Cao Tianhong (platoon leader of the 3rd Machine Gun Company of the 4th Regiment of the 2nd Brigade of the 202nd Division).</p>
<p>[Another Report] After the accident, Ye Wenzhao, Chief of the Police Bureau's Dachan Branch, went to the scene to handle the aftermath.

The Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government had originally planned to hold a collective swearing-in ceremony at the Great Victory Auditorium yesterday.

<h3>Head of Counterfeit Legal Tender and US Dollar Operation Surrenders; Clues to Accomplices Discovered; Possible Roundup in One or Two Days</h3>
<p>The Second Investigation Brigade of the Investigation Department of the Garrison Command recently cracked a counterfeit legal tender and US dollar operation in Caohejing. The evidence and witnesses were all seized on the spot, and the main culprit, a Soviet named Luo Gaoqingkaofu, confessed to all his crimes. However, he claimed that he was only responsible for the plate-making and printing work, and that the distribution was not done by him. Therefore, the number of legal tender and US dollars that have already been issued is difficult to ascertain for the time being. It is heard that the Garrison Command has also obtained leads to Luo Gaoqingkaofu's accomplices and may be able to round them up within one or two days. It is also learned that the owner of the house where Luo Gaoqingkaofu's printing operation was located, Zhang Ziwen, was out when the case was cracked a few days ago and was not apprehended. Zhang surrendered to the Second Investigation Brigade on his own initiative at 11:00 AM yesterday. He was granted bail due to illness at the time. Zhang denied any knowledge of the counterfeit currency operation, but Luo Gaoqingkaofu rented Zhang's house at a high price of one million yuan per month, which raises some doubts. The investigators in this case will continue to investigate.</p>
<h3>Land Bureau Proposes Three Measures to Handle Unfinished Procedures for Land Allocation in the Central District</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Land Bureau took over more than 5,000 mu of civilian land in the Jiangwan, Yinhang, and Yinxiang districts, which were requisitioned by the former Municipal Government for the construction of the central district. Due to the loss and incompleteness of the original case files, it is difficult to reorganize them. The former Municipal Government established the Central District Construction Committee and the Economic Management Committee for the Central District, and announced the "Regulations on Land Allocation in the Central District of Shanghai" and the "Measures for Employees of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters and Government Agencies to Purchase Land in the Central District," and stipulated regulations on collecting overdue interest on land waste fees and paying official interest to facilitate the smooth implementation. All work was suspended after the outbreak of the war, and the area was heavily damaged by the enemy army, resulting in drastic changes. After the victory, many original landowners came to inquire about unfinished procedures. In addition to the unpaid price portion, the Land Bureau had previously formulated measures and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval. The bureau has also formulated measures to handle the delayed cancellation of title deeds and land occupied by the enemy army, and will submit them to the Municipal Government for approval. The measures are:</p>
<p>(1) For the portion of the original owners who delayed canceling the title deeds: Announce to the original owners a deadline to cancel the title deeds, and declare that after the deadline, the title deeds will only be used as vouchers for receiving the land price and will not have other legal effects.</p>
<p>(2) For the portion of allocated land occupied by the enemy army: Follow the four principles for handling land according to the order of the Executive Yuan and handle it according to the compensation method.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the overdue interest on land waste fees and the payment of official interest: There are no clear records in the original files, it is difficult to investigate, and the amounts are small, so it is proposed to waive them.</p>
<p>The above measures, along with the entire process of clearing up the land allocation in the former central district, will be reported to the Municipal Government for approval. In addition, in order to complete the handling of this case, the Land Bureau cannot do it alone. Therefore, it is requested that the Municipal Government order the relevant bureaus to organize a temporary handling agency to assist in the process so that it can be completed as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Fake Lawyers on Wanted List Allowed to Register After Suspension Period Expires</h3>

The general idea is: "If the lawyer was only wanted for appearing in the fake court and has no other crimes, after the suspension period expires, he may be allowed to obtain a guarantee letter from two or more recommended officials and personally report to the local district court. After verification, the court will forward a request to cancel the wanted status and allow registration. As for those who have received lawyer certificates issued by fake organizations, they should apply for new certificates, and the deadline is extended to the end of this month."</p>

Recently, the company and the US Maritime Commission planned to build five around-the-world ships, each with a gross tonnage of 11,250 tons and a length of 536 feet. They can carry 189 passengers and have a speed of 19 knots per hour, which is twice the size of the Monroe and other ships. After completion, there will be seven ships operating on the around-the-world route.</p>

<h3>Grand Gathering at Yiyuan; Bank of Communications Holds Lunch Yesterday to Commemorate 40th Anniversary</h3>
<p>The Bank of Communications has reached its 40th anniversary. The bank held a commemorative meeting at Yiyuan at 10:00 AM yesterday. Xu Baiyuan, Vice Minister of Finance and Secretary-General of the Joint Treasury, came to Shanghai yesterday to participate.

The commemorative meeting was presided over by Qian Xinzhi, Chairman of the Bank. Qian delivered a speech on the spot, reporting on the establishment and business development of the bank, and encouraged colleagues to work together to fulfill the mission entrusted by the government. Xu Baiyuan, Vice Minister, then delivered a speech, stating that the Bank of Communications has achieved remarkable results under the leadership of Chairman Qian and General Manager Zhao. He hopes that the bank's colleagues will continue to work hard and serve the country and society more. Wang Zhengting, Zhang Jiaao, and Quan, the former chairman of the bank, also delivered speeches, encouraging everyone. Zhang was one of the founders of the bank and was particularly moved by the past difficulties. Now that they have been overcome one by one, he hopes that the bank's colleagues will strive for business development in the future. Xu, the Vice Minister, then proposed an ad hoc motion that Mr. Hu Jiang, the former chairman of the bank, was summoned by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in August 1938 and flew from Hong Kong to Chongqing. He was unfortunately killed by enemy aircraft fire, making him the first person in the financial community to sacrifice for the War of Resistance. He proposed that a statue of Hu be cast and displayed in the Bank of Communications to commemorate him and honor his loyalty. The entire venue unanimously approved. The ceremony was then completed with a group photo and lunch. In the afternoon, there were also recreational activities such as employee ball games, qingchang, Ping opera, and magic, which ended happily at around 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Many Indictments for Traitor Cases; Gu Nanqun Not Indicted</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Chen Zizheng from Shanxi was accused of handing over factories to the puppet regime after the so-called "Return to the Capital" during the occupation period in Shanghai, based on the enemy's guidelines for handling factories managed by the enemy army. These included the Hengda New Ji Textile Factory, located on South Street, Yangsi District, Pudong, and the Hengxingtai Oil Mill, located in Hebei, Caojiadu. Chen was assigned by the puppet regime to receive them. He later served as the manager of the Xinda Yarn Factory. The High Prosecutor's Office has completed its investigation and filed a public indictment on suspicion of treason. However, it is heard that Chen has already fled back to Shanxi. In addition, the treason suspicion case of Huang Yaqiang and others, and the enemy collusion suspicion case of foreign national Luo Jiaxuefu and others have been prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office. Gu Nanqun was accused of having many enemy agents lurking in the Nanyang Hospital when he was the director of the hospital. Chiang Bocheng was captured by the enemy army while being treated at Nanyang Hospital. After the victory, Gu was reported on suspicion of treason. After investigation by the Commercial Inspection Office, he was not prosecuted.</p>
<h3>Xia Peizhen Case Sets Precedent; Prosecutor Wins Appeal; Opium Offenders Can Be Exempt from Execution of Sentence if They Can Quit</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Since the victory and restoration, the government has been determined to ban opium and drugs, and the city's police authorities have made every effort to implement this policy. However, during the occupation period in this city, a large number of citizens were poisoned by the enemy. Therefore, the judicial authorities still adhere to the principle of actively influencing opium addicts and turning them from bad to good, giving them the opportunity to renew and improve. The District Prosecutor's Office once applied for exemption from the execution of the original sentence for Xia Peizhen, an opium addict, in accordance with the Law on Security Measures. At that time, the District Court rejected the application on the grounds that the defendant had been addicted to opium for a long time and needed to serve a full year before being able to adapt to the four seasons. Prosecutor Chuanbang of the District Prosecutor's Office appealed to the High Court. It is now learned that he has won the legal victory. The High Court collegially held that the defendant had served the detoxification sentence for two months, and the forensic medical examination showed that there were no signs of opium addiction, which is in line with the requirements of Article 88, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law, and that the execution of the sentence should be waived. The addiction to opium waxes and wanes with the change of seasons is also not supported by medical theory. The appeal should be considered reasonable, the original ruling should be revoked, and the imprisonment of Xia Peizhen should be waived. Although Xia has been released from prison under the amnesty, it has set a precedent for the problem of executing prison sentences for opium addicts after detoxification.</p>
<h3>Suspect of Colluding with Enemy and Trafficking Drugs, Former Puppet Yinxiang Township Chief Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Shi Jianqing, who served as the puppet Yinxiang Township Chief, Section Chief of the puppet China Trust Bureau, and technician of the puppet Ministry of Transportation, was recently secretly reported to the District Prosecutor's Office by residents of Tilan Bridge in this city.

After the victory, he hid in the countryside for a long time, and recently appeared in this city again, and is still engaged in his old business of drug trafficking. Prosecutors and police officers have arrested him for interrogation based on the secret report and taken him into custody. The portion of the charge of treason will be transferred to the High Court for handling after the District Prosecutor's Office completes its investigation of his drug trafficking portion.</p>

<h3>New Tools for Propaganda: An Overview of Radio Stations in This City</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Before the war, Shanghai had forty to fifty radio stations. After the victory, the number of restored and newly established stations reached as many as one hundred and five, including public, commercial, foreign-owned, semi-public/semi-commercial, and foreign stations with political backing. With so many stations, the airwaves were clearly chaotic. The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau and the Garrison Headquarters' Radio Inspection Section, in accordance with the Ministry of Communications' regulations, stipulated that Shanghai's public and commercial radio stations should not exceed ten K.C. (kilocycles), and foreigners were not allowed to set up radio stations in the country. After several months of rectification and suppression, the following eighteen stations were approved and licensed by the Ministry of Communications and remain in operation: China Freedom, Golden Capital, America-Rinji, Great China, Mainland, Eastern Sino-American, Yuanchang Heming, United, Gospel, Five Continents, Cooperation, People's Voice, 99, New Voice, Great China, New Shanghai, Datong, Jiancheng, and Chinese Culture. Among them, America-Rinji, Great China, and Mainland (originally two separate stations) share one kilocycle, while the rest share one kilocycle between two stations. In addition, there are the "Shanghai" station of the Central Broadcasting Administration, the "Municipal Police" station of the Police Bureau, and the "Victory" station of the Military Police Headquarters, which is currently applying for a license, making a total of three public stations.</p>
<p>Among the above twenty-one radio stations, Municipal Police and Victory are exclusively for the police and military police's own business and academic broadcasting, without commercials or entertainment programs. The Gospel radio station is set up to promote Christian doctrine, and apart from broadcasting the "Gospel" and hymns to church members, it does not have commercial advertising.</p>
<p>Regarding the equipment of these radio stations, they generally have simple machine rooms, broadcasting studios, and soundproof rooms. The transmitters they use range from 200 to 500 watts. As for the number of records, there is a significant disparity among the stations, but they can be rented from record companies at any time.</p>
<p>In terms of programming, the content is changed monthly, with little difference between stations. Entertainment and advertising programs are divided into storytelling, commentaries, Peking opera, spoken drama, Shanghai opera, Yue opera, freestyle singing, songs, comedy, stories, and other categories. Educational programs such as America-Rinji's radio science, Yuanchang Heming's law, and Chinese Culture's science lectures occupy only 15 to 20 percent of the daily program schedule because they are free broadcasts. According to the person in charge of the trade association, they often receive letters from listeners requesting more educational programs, which is a good sign. Among the entertainment programs mentioned above, the Shanghai opera by the Wenbin and Zhongyi drama troupes, the Yue opera by the Danggui and Fu Quanxiang drama troupes, and the comedy by Zhou Bochun and Yao Mushuang all have a large audience, so their prices are mostly around two million yuan per month. If the host personally broadcasts or adds a special program, an additional 400,000 to 500,000 yuan or more is required. Peking opera and singing are second. Each station has special programs on Sundays.</p>
<p>Radio station electricity rates are calculated on a monthly basis and are determined by the association. Every forty minutes is called a "block" (from the first day of next month, it will be changed to thirty minutes per block). The two blocks from 8:40 PM to 10:00 PM are the most expensive, at 850,000 yuan. Between 5:20 PM and 8:40 PM, each block is 800,000 yuan. Between 11:20 AM and 5:20 PM, each block is 650,000 yuan. The remaining blocks are all 400,000 yuan, from 7:00 AM to 12:00 PM daily. In addition, there are small announcements, reported three times a day for 150,000 yuan, and full-day reports for 500,000 yuan. The average monthly income for each station, after deducting expenses and taxes, is around five million yuan. There are rumors outside that there is a black market for radio advertising, but the association explains that this is extremely rare. However, because rebroadcasting programs from various theaters requires installing equipment and additional management costs, it may be unavoidable to add to the customer's burden.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that each station has one or two female announcers. Their salaries are not high, but most of them are interested in the profession, opening up a new path for women's careers.</p>
<p>Among the public radio stations, the "Shanghai" station is the largest in scale. In terms of organization, equipment, and programming, it can be called the best in the country. The entire station employs more than one hundred people, and the transmission department has more than ten foreign staff members. The station currently has one shortwave transmitter with a wavelength of 25 meters, which is used exclusively for broadcasting news to foreign countries. It has three medium-wave transmitters, using 900, 800, and 740 KC. In addition to regularly broadcasting news, current affairs commentaries, literature and art, education, and community service programs, it also engages in advertising. After the closure of Soviet, American, and other radio stations, foreign advertising has all moved to the Shanghai Radio Station. Its music program is specially arranged and organized by experts, with composers as a unit, and generally broadcasts the works of one composer every night.</p>
<p>Recently, in order to expand its business, the Shanghai Radio Station has purchased more than 200 acres of vacant land near the Qiujiang Wharf, and is preparing to build a powerful new radio station, which can start broadcasting this year.</p>
<p>Spring is the season for broadcasting. I hope that the market can improve day by day, allowing the gentle tones of the radio hostesses to be broadcast into everyone's heart.</p>

<h3>(1) Selling a Brother's Property Without Permission</h3>
<p>Li Danwen asks: After my father passed away, his estate was divided equally among my three brothers. Now my share has been sold by my eldest brother without permission. I would like to ask: (1) Is it effective to file a report with the local county government? (2) Which agency handles lawsuits in the current county jurisdiction? (3) If the other party also files a report with the court to confirm property rights in the future, how should I respond? (4) If a lawsuit is filed in the future, according to the three-level, three-instance system, must it be filed from the county intermediate court after going through the township office? (5) Is there a fee for filing a report? (6) What are the procedures for hiring a lawyer to litigate on my behalf?</p>
<p>[Union Lawyer Answers] (1) If property is sold by others without authorization, it cannot be remedied by filing a report. A lawsuit should be filed with the judicial authority where the real estate is located, requesting that the sale be declared invalid. This is a civil lawsuit, and not only must a complaint be filed, but the person himself or a litigation agent must appear in court to testify. (2) Each county has a judicial agency to handle lawsuits. If a court has not been established, it is handled by the Judicial Office. (3) Property rights are not confirmed by filing a report. (4) The three-level, three-instance system does not go through the district office, and the lawsuit is filed with the county's judicial agency. (5) There is no litigation fee for filing a report. If a lawsuit is filed, a litigation fee of 13 per thousand must be paid. (6) Investigate locally.</p>
<p>(2)  Refuses to Repay</p>
<p>A friend of mine owes me more than ten dan of grain, but he avoids meeting me when it is due. I would like to ask: (1) What methods should I use to force him to repay it? If the court mediates and speaks on his behalf, how should I respond?</p>
<p>[Union Lawyer Answers] Failure to fulfill a debt in good faith with the intention of causing damage to the creditor is liable for compensation. In order to prevent the occurrence of damage, the creditor can apply for provisional execution during the lawsuit. I will now answer the various points raised as follows: (1) File a lawsuit and request a declaration of provisional execution. (2) If the court advises a peaceful resolution that is not biased towards one party, if the interested party does not want a settlement, he can request a judgment according to law.</p>

<h3>Tensions Run High in Basketball League: Shantou Team Wins Hard-Fought Victory Against Giant; 28-25, a Three-Point Defeat of a Strong Opponent; Nearly a Thousand Spectators Rejoice</h3>
<p>[Report by Our Newspaper] The Navy-Marine Corps Youth Team (Hai Lu Qing) formally sent a letter yesterday to the Basketball League Committee to withdraw from the competition. The reason given was that, in addition to the eight players selected from the Columbus team, the Navy-Marine Corps Youth team also had two representatives chosen to represent the navy in Qingdao. Moreover, due to the intense matches with various teams in recent days, many players were injured. The committee has approved their request, and therefore, all of the team's results will be canceled and not counted. The Giant team benefited greatly from this, gaining a significant advantage. The team was overjoyed to receive this news before the match.</p>
<p>Last night, in the Group A match, the Shantou team defeated the Giant team 28-25, maintaining their winning streak with six wins and zero losses. Nearly a thousand spectators were visibly delighted. In the Group A2 match, Jia Shen defeated Huayang 41-29. Shantou's actions sometimes seemed overly aggressive. The details of the matches are as follows:</p>
<p>Jia Shen Defeats Huayang</p>
<p>The Huayang vs. Jia Shen match was in Group A2. In the first half, Jia Shen was more active, with the "fat guys" (Huayang) trailing by four points, the score being 20-16. Resuming the game, Huayang's Sun Mingxin and Chen Zhaoting each scored two consecutive baskets, suddenly tying the score at 20-20. The situation changed, and soon they took the lead at 24-23. Jia Shen did not dare to relax; Xia Zeren led the attack, and indeed, all forces were mobilized. Soon, they regained the lead at 31-25. The "fat guys" only had five players last night, and after 45 minutes of running around, they all felt powerless. At 31-25, Jia Shen's Tao Yingshi fouled out for the fourth time, and Yan Shilu replaced him. The final score was 41-29, with Jia Shen winning.</p>
<p>Jia Shen Fouls Points Huayang Fouls Points</p>
<p>Zhu Zhonglin 1 10 Dong Zhongyi 1 8</p>
<p>Tao Yingshi 5 8 Sun Mingxin 1 8</p>
<p>Sun Moxi 2 8 Chen Zhaoting 3 4</p>
<p>Xia Zeren 0 0 Song Qifu 2 1</p>
<p>Lü Miaosheng 4 11 Liu Benqin 3 8</p>
<p>Yan Shilu 1 4 Total 10 29</p>
<p>Total 13 41</p>
<p>Shantou Team Wins Against Giant</p>
<p>Chen Qingjiang broke through on the left and made a jump shot. This shot was crisp. Vonick reciprocated, but Chiang Sheh-lai fouled Qingjiang, giving him one point. N. Sassis also fouled, but Ji Nankang missed both free throws. Qingjiang made the score 5-2. The Giant team called a timeout, and He Lide also managed to score a basket (7-2). Tao Bolingji scored on a free throw, and Sassis scored under the basket. Chen again took over, and Lide continued to contribute, bringing the score to 11-5. Cai Yanxiong added another basket, making it 13-6. The Giant team desperately counterattacked, but with little effect. In the first half, the Shantou team led 18-10, and the spectators were overjoyed.</p>
<p>Because the Giant team was unaware that this match was related to the championship (due to the Navy-Marine Corps Youth team withdrawing), they had not gathered their star player, Gu Fo, and proceeded carelessly. In the second half, Jelong and Tao Bolingji increased the score by three points. The Shantou team called a timeout, making it 19-13. Lin Weicong replaced Ji Nankang, and Tao scored again, making it 19-15. The Shantou team panicked and called another timeout. Vonick made a long shot (21-17), and Lin Weicong quickly scored two points, making it 24-18. "Monkey" Tao Bolingji and Jelong scored, leaving only four minutes, with only a one-point difference (24-23). Cai and He each scored on free throws. Jelong made an odd shot, still with a one-point difference. Lin passed to Cai, who made a long shot. At this point, the Shantou team voluntarily gave up two free throws. The center pass came, and with 35 seconds left, Cai fouled out. Tao also fouled out ten seconds later, a coincidence. The final score was 28-25, with the Shantou team winning, but with much effort.</p>

<h3>Hubei Football and Basketball Teams Will Visit Beijing and Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from Hankou by Our Newspaper] After the Hubei provincial football and basketball teams won the double championship in the Central China Games, their self-confidence has greatly increased. It is generally believed that when the "Hongxiang" and "Zhengxun" teams came to Hankou before, the Wuhan teams were still disorganized and could not withstand a strong enemy. This time, they showed their skills in Central China, which was due to the weaker strength of the Hunan, Henan, and Jiangxi teams, but also due to the progress of Hubei's football skills in the past six months. Therefore, the local sports community suggested that these two representative teams should be slightly adjusted to prepare for visits to Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Anhui to make further observations. It is reported that this proposal is gradually becoming more concrete, and once the travel expenses are raised, a departure date can be set.</p>
<h3>Notes from the Basketball Court</h3>
<p>Last night in the basketball league, the Shantou team maintained their winning streak, defeating the Giants by three points.</p>
<p>The Giants had already lost to the National Final, and their morale was low. Their star player, Gu Fo, did not play in yesterday's match. At the start of the match, they learned that the Navy-Marine Corps Youth team had forfeited twice, and their qualifications were canceled according to the rules, and their past results were not counted. In this way, the Giants only lost to Hualian in one match, and they still had a glimmer of hope for the championship. The whole team was determined to fight hard, and the battle situation became intense.</p>
<p>The Shantou team has been in good condition recently. The main reason for their victory last night was their consistent caution and cherishing of possession of the ball, rarely wasting it. Although they were under constant threat, they were finally able to maintain their victory. In the first half, Chen Qingjiang and He Lide were active, leading by as many as four goals with a score of 18-10. In the second half, Chen was closely guarded by N. Sassis, and He was also restrained by Vonick. Jelong also performed beyond his usual level, and the Shantou team was caught in a hard fight.</p>
<p>At 19-13, Lin Wei saw that the situation was not good and replaced Ji Nankang.</p>
<p>The Giants twice forced the score to be close at 24-23 and 26-25. Yanxiong's shot secured the victory.</p>
<p>If Gu Fo had been present, the situation would have been favorable to the Giants, and the battle would have been even more exciting.</p>
<p>Cai Yanxiong was a hero for the Shantou team. Apart from Du Lai, the Giants performed well, and Jelong's shooting and Tao Bolingji's intrusions posed a great threat to the Shantou team. (Changnian)</p>
<h3>Changes in the Basketball League Situation: Hualian and Shantou Compete for the Championship; American Military and Navy-Marine Corps Teams Withdraw from the League</h3>
<p>The American Military and Navy-Marine Corps basketball teams recently sent two statements to the Basketball Committee, declaring their withdrawal from the league. The situation in Group A1 has changed. The standings are as follows:</p>
<p>Group A1 Matches Wins Losses Percentage</p>
<p>Shantou Team 5 5 0 1.000</p>

<p>Railway Beijing 7 0 7 .000</p>
<h3>Plan for Transferring State-Owned Enterprises to Private Operation: Committee Held Second Meeting Yesterday; Passed More Than Ten Draft Articles on Sale Methods, Carried to the Capital by Vice President Weng for Approval</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Planning Committee for Transferring State-Owned Production Enterprises to Private Operation held its second meeting at the Bank of China Building in this city at approximately 4:00 PM yesterday.  Executive Yuan Vice President Wen personally attended and presided over the meeting. Wang Yunwu, Zhang Gongquan, Liu Gongyun, Li Fuson, Chen Guangfu, Qin Jianqing, Dong Daoren, Yang Gongren, Xu Kan, Hu Yunqiu, and others were present.  The meeting adjourned at approximately 6:00 PM.  More than ten draft articles on the methods of selling state-owned production enterprises were immediately approved.  The draft articles contain detailed regulations on the steps, methods, timing, application procedures, and conditions for the sale. During yesterday's meeting, opinions were sought from the attendees on each article.  The extracted results were carried to the capital today by Vice President Weng to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for deliberation, so as to make a final decision.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Vice President Weng told reporters after the meeting: Since the first meeting of this committee was held in Shanghai on the 22nd of last month, several consultations have also been held in the capital. This meeting still focuses on the exchange of opinions, so as to facilitate submission to the Executive Yuan for approval later. As for the method of transferring to private operation, the overall plan has not yet been finalized, so it is not convenient to disclose it beforehand. However, the principle is to sell directly to private operation. He believes that the entire plan can be implemented within a month after it is finalized.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] According to informed sources: The methods for transferring state-owned production enterprises to private operation will generally adopt a bidding method for small-scale production enterprises. Large-scale production enterprises will be divided into several systematic and related segments according to the nature of their business, and then transferred to private investment and operation in stages and batches by issuing stocks. The valuation of each enterprise may be difficult. However, because there was a valuation list for the takeover at the time of the initial takeover, it can also be used as a reference for valuation.</p>
<h3>National Banks and Bureaus Promote Deposit Business: Four Banks Joint Office Formulates Outline</h3>
<p>The Four Banks Joint Office, considering that the deposit business of various national banks and bureaus was quite developed before the war, but during the war, due to the impact of rising prices and high market interest rates, some deposits gradually left the banks. Since the restoration, this phenomenon has not been eliminated, so it has formulated a seven-point outline to strengthen and promote the deposit business of various banks and bureaus, and ordered all branches to handle it. The content is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The local branches should discuss and adjust the deposit interest rate standards with reference to the local market conditions, and the local banks and bureaus should handle it consistently. (2) The Farmers Bank and the Cooperative Treasury should universally promote rural savings. (3) The postal savings business should be popularized in the interior, and a comprehensive campaign should be launched to encourage savings, and the Central Bank should give preferential transfer interest rates. (4) Conduct various trust and special savings deposits to stimulate depositors' interest (such as group dividend deposits, etc.) (5) Simplify deposit and withdrawal procedures, and allow fixed deposit receipts to be pledged at any time, and the interest taken shall not be higher than 30% of the deposit interest. Priority should be given to depositors' remittances. (6) The Ministry of Finance shall supervise commercial banks and villages to expand the absorption of deposits, and shall be allowed to transfer deposits to the Central Bank at the most preferential interest. (7) When commercial banks and villages stop business or go bankrupt, the Ministry of Finance shall order them to clear all deposits within the shortest period of time to protect the interests of depositors and increase public confidence in the banks.</p>
<p>(Another Dispatch) After the promulgation of the Outline for National Banks and Bureaus to Promote Deposit Business, a reporter from the Joint Credit Information Center specially visited the person in charge of the Four Banks Joint Office to inquire about the situation of bank deposit business and the prospects after the implementation of the Outline. The person in charge informed that bank deposits have three significant characteristics: (1) The proportion of current deposits is increasing, and the proportion of fixed deposits is decreasing. (2) The proportion of institutional deposits is increasing, and the proportion of industrial, commercial, and individual deposits is decreasing. (3) The nominal figures of deposits are increasing, and the actual monetary value of deposits is decreasing.</p>
<p>The various items stipulated in this Outline, such as adjusting deposit interest rates, intensifying savings absorption, simplifying deposit and withdrawal, and protecting the interests of depositors, are all countermeasures against current malpractices. The government has been engaged in saving expenses and increasing income in order to stabilize the monetary value. Recently, the trading of gold has been banned, the circulation of foreign currency has been prohibited, the prices of necessities have been controlled, and hoarding has been strictly prohibited. In the future, the outlets for hot money will tend to narrow, and it may gradually return to banks and be deposited. National banks and bureaus are implementing government policies and handling loans for production enterprises, and it is appropriate to take this opportunity to actively promote deposit business, intensify the absorption of hot money, and use the contraction of currency to assist production, which is truly a win-win situation.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Refineries Plan to Sell by Unit</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] It is learned that the current estimated value of Taiwan Sugar Corporation is NT$30 billion. The company has a total of 36 sugar refinery units. Relevant parties have stated that in the current period of rampant high-interest loans, it may not be possible to fully promote the transfer to private operation by issuing stocks. It is better to sell the affiliated sugar refineries by unit for private investment and operation. It is learned that the daily sugar extraction capacity of each sugar refinery unit varies from 1,000 tons to 3,600 tons. The estimated value of each unit ranges from US$2 million to US$3 million. If they can be sold by unit, there will inevitably be competition between factories, which can also improve the production efficiency of each sugar refinery.</p>
<h3>Raising Deposit Interest Rates by National Banks Still Awaiting Careful Consideration</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A certain senior person in the financial community stated: The Ministry of Finance is still carefully studying the plan to raise interest rates by national banks, and implementation is still pending. It is heard that many senior officials of the Ministry of Finance oppose this method, and their main reasons are three: (1) If the interest rates of national banks are raised, the hidden interest rates in the market may also rise, and the result will stimulate prices and oppress legitimate industry and commerce. At the same time, in terms of the current trend of prices, it is quite difficult to absorb a large amount of hot money by raising interest rates. (2) After national banks absorb deposits, they will in principle lend them out at low interest rates. In this situation, unscrupulous merchants may use various methods to deposit funds borrowed at low interest into national banks at high interest, or flow into the black market at high interest, and this kind of malpractice is difficult to prevent. (3) If national banks absorb deposits at high interest rates and release them at low interest rates, the resulting deficit will inevitably be huge. If the national treasury subsidizes it, it will inevitably expand the fiscal deficit and accelerate the issuance of currency, which is greatly contrary to the purpose of stabilizing the entire economy.</p>
<h3>Export Commodity Trends After Foreign Exchange Adjustment</h3>
<p>— Zhang Bo'an</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, Shanghai's export commodities, first stimulated by the subsidy policy, and then by the foreign exchange adjustment, have all risen in unison, creating the largest wave since the victory. The trends of each commodity are described below:</p>
<p>(1) Tung Oil The recent price of tung oil has increased by 290% compared with the end of last year. If calculated based on the recent price in New York of US$0.375 per pound, the delivery price in New York is equivalent to CN¥500,400. The price in various British territories in Europe ranges from £220 to £245 per ton, and the equivalent CN¥ price is as high as CN¥500,000 and as low as CN¥440,000. After deducting freight, insurance, and taxes, the domestic price is too high, and it is mostly impossible to export. Moreover, the current inventory in various producing areas in China is extremely thin, and the new oil extraction is expected to start at the end of this month. If new goods are launched on the market, the domestic price may be reduced.</p>
<p>(2) Hog Bristles The increase in hog bristles is also very high. Shanghai No. 17 black hog bristles, weighing 133 pounds per case, have risen from CN¥1,020,000 to CN¥3,000,000, an increase of 294%. Hankou No. 17 black hog bristles have risen from CN¥1,400,000 to CN¥5,500,000, an increase of 392%. Chongqing No. 27 black hog bristles have risen from CN¥1,300,000 to CN¥3,900,000, an increase of 300%. Currently, the US government is selling pre-war inventories, so except for Shanghai, which is uniquely popular, other bristles such as Sichuan, Hankou, and Tianjin are very weak. The New York market price for Shanghai bristles is US$2.10 per pound, equivalent to CN¥3,350,000, and Sichuan bristles are US$2.60 per pound, equivalent to CN¥4,150,000. Hankou bristles have fallen from US$4.20 to US$3.50, equivalent to CN¥5,780,000. According to the current price, it has also hit the top. The export volume of hog bristles last year was 9,000,000 pounds. After the foreign exchange adjustment this year, it has risen three times, so the export is expected to increase.</p>
<p>(3) Tea The export of tea has long been hindered by the excessively low foreign price. After the foreign exchange adjustment, the increase rate is only 170%, which is not as high as others. The current authorities have frequently paid attention to the export of Chinese tea. If a bumper harvest is obtained this year, the export can be increased. The export volume of tea last year was 7,500,000 pounds, only one-tenth of that before the war.</p>
<p>(4) Casings According to industry insiders, the export value of casings this year can reach 8,000 barrels, with a total value of US$52 million. The appreciation rate is 654%, which is better than the rate of any other export commodity. Currently, the New York market price has fallen from US$0.62 per pair to US$0.52 per pair. Buyers are waiting and seeing, and there is still a downward trend. Therefore, the equivalent CN¥ price per barrel is CN¥7,800,000, deducting freight and other expenses of CN¥1,000,000, for a total of CN¥6,800,000. However, the manufacturing cost of Shanghai casings is CN¥7,600,000, and the current price is CN¥7,200,000, which is tantamount to losing money. Therefore, export transportation still depends on lower production costs to be able to do it.</p>
<p>(5) Feathers The increase rate of feathers has also reached 220% to 285%. Recently, sales have been booming. Foreign merchants have frequently favored them, and foreign goods have come one after another. The domestic price is still low and the foreign price is not weak, which is quite a feeling of prosperity for a while.</p>
<p>(6) Raw Silk The increase rate of raw silk can be said to be one of the lowest of export commodities. The highest increase rate is only 170%. Recently, the market situation has been poor, and holders have sold off one after another. Foreign firms are not moving forward. Jardine Matheson and Swedish firms are cutting prices sharply, and only Indian firm Haiwu is still interested, so the market situation is still difficult to look at.</p>
<p>(Other) Other items such as frozen eggs and egg yolks have also been resurrected recently. Wuzi cannot be exported. Lace, handicrafts, foreign pillows, straw hats, buttons, etc., have been affected by the rise in market prices and frequent price cuts abroad, so exports have been greatly affected.</p>
<h3>After the Adjustment of Consolidated Tax and Stamp Tax, Flour Manufacturers Put Forward Requirements: (1) Cancel Price Limit and Restore Free Trade (2) Add CN¥819 Per Bag of Flour</h3>
<p>The Fourth District Flour Industry Association, due to the Ministry of Finance's increase in taxes on flour, decided to report to Mayor Wu today to adjust prices and request the Ministry of Finance to maintain the original tax rate. According to Mr. Cao Qidong, the person in charge of Fuxin Flour Mill, the mill recently received a letter from the Direct Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance stating that each mill must calculate stamp tax at a rate of 3 per thousand in the future. At the same time, a letter from the Commodity Tax Bureau stated that the consolidated tax on flour has been changed to CN¥1,000 per bag since the 10th, an increase of CN¥700 compared to the previous rate, and the tax difference for the week from the 3rd to the 9th of this month must also be recovered. In the past, when the flour distribution meeting was held in the municipal government, Mayor Wu allowed each mill to pay CN¥20 per bag for stamp tax for the distribution of essential goods for people's livelihood, regardless of the distribution price. Currently, the mill's distribution price is CN¥45,000, and the stamp tax for this week's distribution will be CN¥115 more per bag than the previous CN¥20. The cost per bag of flour is between CN¥52,500 and CN¥55,000. China Trading Bureau distributes 100,000 bags of foreign flour at CN¥30,000 per bag, but the factory must advance 200,000 bags of flour. Although the government has subsidies, the difference can only offset each other, and there is no profit at all. Moreover, Mayor Wu had already recognized the cost item as the minimum price limit. Now that the government has increased taxes from the Ministry of Finance to balance revenue and expenditure, the government's tax revenue is not levied on the factory's profits, but directly transfers its property to the national treasury. Therefore, the factory requires two points: (1) Within the current price limit, the additional tax amount will be borne by the consumer, and CN¥815 will be added per bag of flour. (2) If the price limit system for flour can be cancelled and free trade can be restored, the factory will abide by the government's increased tax rate. He continued to say that recently, China Trading Bureau and China Cereals Corporation, two institutions, have thrown out huge amounts of benefit flour on the free market, while private flour mills are suffering through difficult years for the national economy and people's livelihood under the government's price limit policy.</p>
<h3>Cube Sugar Waiting for Shipment to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Taiwan Sugar Corporation, in view of the need for cube sugar, in order to adapt to the market, has moved the selection of high-grade raw materials from the Taiwan Provincial Head Office to process and manufacture a kind of snow-white cube sugar, which has now been produced in large quantities and is waiting for shipment to Shanghai. The first batch has more than 1,000 boxes, each box containing 25 pounds, and the selling price is estimated at CN¥3,000 per box. It is also learned that during the turmoil in Taiwan Province last time, all 17,000 employees of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, including the Huwei, Tainan Madou, Xinying and Kaohsiung Dong et al. Companies, and the machinery, etc., were all safe, and there was no problem with the sugar supply.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Iron and Steel Company Plans Production</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Iron and Steel Company, jointly operated by the government and merchants, has recently formulated a production plan since its establishment in late last month. The company's Pudong smelting furnace, Wusong steelmaking furnace, and Huangxing Road steel rolling mill are expected to start construction in May. The steelmaking furnace will produce 670 tons of steel per day, and the steel rolling mill will roll 200 tons of steel per day, with a value of CN¥4 billion. After construction starts, the amount of scrap iron smelted per month in this city will be more than 1,500 tons. The amount that was previously sent to Japan because it could not be used can all be recovered by the factory. China Trading Bureau's Ma Yuanyou has 4,000 to 5,000 tons of scrap iron seized from the enemy, which will also be smelted and cast by the factory. The 3,000-horsepower machine of the entire factory has been approved by the Public Utilities Bureau's Standing Review Committee to connect to electricity, and the construction will be completed soon. It will become the only large-scale smelting factory in Shanghai after the Shanghai stock issue. Its products will be used for machinery manufacturing and the construction industry.</p>
<h3>Lottery for Unified B Type and C Type Public Bonds on the 10th of Next Month</h3>
<p>The 23rd redemption lottery for the B type bonds of the Ministry of Finance's 25th Year Unified Public Bonds totals 36 branches, totaling CN¥12.6 million. The 16th redemption lottery for the 27th Year National Defense Public Bonds totals 10 branches, totaling CN¥500,000. The 7th lottery for the 3rd installment of the 30th Year Construction Public Bonds totals 5 branches, totaling CN¥2 million. It has been decided that the above three types of bonds will be drawn on the 10th of next month at the Ministry's Shanghai Office.</p>
<h3>Silver Shops May Reopen, Gold Allocation Not Yet Approved</h3>
<p>The silver shop industry in this city has been ordered to suspend business for more than a month. After repeated appeals from the industry, it is learned that the Ministry of Finance has agreed to reopen and will announce the operating regulations for the silver shop industry the day after tomorrow (the 19th). It is heard that the free trading of gold may be allowed, but the Central Bank will no longer allocate it. Therefore, the silver shop industry is still extremely panicked after hearing the news and has sent representative Yao Guiqing to Beijing yesterday morning. Labor representatives are also scheduled to depart for Beijing today to petition the Third Plenary Session, requesting the restoration of the allocation.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Import and Export Industries to Petition Central Bank Today</h3>
<p>The Import and Export Industry Association originally scheduled to petition Zhang Jia'ao, President of the Central Bank, last Sunday, but since some opinions had not been agreed upon and it was learned that President Zhang had gone to Beijing on official business, it was decided to send representatives to petition today, requesting the improvement of import and export settlement and import methods.</p>
<h3>Rubber Import Quotas Too Small, Manufacturers Request Appropriate Relaxation, and Differentiation of Raw Rubber and Products</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Rubber Industry Association submitted a document to the Import Control Committee last week, requesting that the import quota of raw rubber be re-determined according to actual needs, and that raw rubber and products be differentiated, and that the import of old tires and waste materials be prohibited. The reasons were that according to actual field investigations, rubber factories in Shanghai alone need 1,739.5 tons of raw rubber per month, while the import quota of rubber and products announced by the Import Control Committee for February-April is only US$1.1 million, which is only enough for one month's use in Shanghai! The total amount of raw rubber needed outside of Shanghai is at least equal to Shanghai, so even if the quota is all raw rubber, the national monthly need is US$2 million. However, this mere US$1.1 million needs to be used for three months, and a part of it needs to be allocated to finished products. Therefore, the ratio to actual needs is one to ten. Under this situation, it is difficult to maintain the rubber industry, so it is hoped that the Import Control Committee can酌情 consider the actual situation and relax the quota. In addition, chemicals needed in the rubber industry, such as zinc oxide powder and lithopone powder, etc., also hope that the government can have appropriate allocation. The chairman of the industry association, Hong Nianzu, told reporters: The rubber industry's reputation last year had its special reasons, and this kind of prosperity cannot last. The outside world compares the rubber industry with the cotton textile industry, which is due to a lack of understanding of the actual situation. There are three reasons for the rubber industry's buzz last year: (1) Last year's supply of raw materials had the allocation of enemy property, and the price per pound was always between CN¥500 and CN¥1,000 per pound. In other words, the price of raw materials was quite stable; (2) The dumping of foreign goods last year was not as fierce as imagined; (3) Most of the domestic rubber factories stopped work before the War of Resistance, and the people urgently needed to replenish them after the war, so the demand was greater. With the above three reasons, coupled with the rise in the price of rubber products, which lagged behind the general price level, the people felt it was cheaper and were happy to buy, creating last year's prosperity. This year, all the favorable factors have ceased to exist.</p>
<h3>Yellow Weasel Skin Price Rises, Leather Market Sees Gains and Losses</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The price of yellow weasel skin suddenly rose again yesterday, and other fox skins, white dog skins, leopard skins, etc. also rose in unison. It is learned that a certain foreign merchant made a good profit from exporting various skins to Europe and seized the opportunity to absorb them at low prices when the market price fell recently. Because very few goods have recently returned to Shanghai from the producing areas, and the goods in the market are becoming increasingly scarce, the market price has rebounded. It is also heard that a large number of yellow weasel skins have arrived in New York, and buyers are cutting prices sharply. The leather market, raw cowhide, sole leather, etc., has been falling for days, and the market rebounded firmly yesterday. The price of various patterned leathers continues to decline.</p>
<h3>Jinshan Branches Stable</h3>
<p>A hundred boxes of Jinshan branches opened yesterday. The goods were still good. The higher price was CN¥660,000, and the next highest was CN¥426,000. The market was flat.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Compatriots Passing Through Hong Kong: Extorted Upon Landing, Losing All U.S. Dollars at the Nation's Gate</h3>
<p>— Hong Kong, 10th [Day] Airmail Dispatch from Our Special Correspondent, Zi Jian</p>
<p>Since the latter half of last year, an average of two or three American ships carrying overseas Chinese returning to the country have arrived in Hong Kong each month. Smaller ships carry two or three hundred people, while larger ships carry thousands, so the average number of overseas Chinese arriving in Hong Kong each month is generally over a thousand. Upon arriving in Hong Kong, overseas Chinese first encounter exorbitant demands or extortion for baggage handling, and even theft and robbery. Almost every time a larger ship arrives, such as the "General Meigs" or "General Gordon," letters from returning overseas Chinese appear in the newspapers, recounting the suffering of being extorted or having their luggage stolen upon landing. Some people lose their entire lifetime of hard-earned savings abroad when they arrive at their nation's gate! This is truly one of the most unbearable tragedies imaginable!</p>
<p>After the war, Hong Kong promulgated a wharf control ordinance, ostensibly aimed at preventing theft in wharf warehouses and on ships, as well as facilitating friends and relatives meeting ships and travel agencies picking up clients. However, it has largely deprived them of these conveniences. Regardless of who the passengers on the ship are, their friends and relatives can only wait outside the wharf's iron gates, beyond the line of sight. It is said that on the day the Papal Nuncio to China came to Hong Kong on a southern tour, the Governor sent his adjutant to welcome him. That adjutant, thinking himself a special person, did not bring any kind of permit or document in advance, so the wharf guards stopped him. As a result, the adjutant and other priests had to wait for the Papal Nuncio outside the iron gates. Needless to say, the friends and relatives of our returning overseas Chinese compatriots have it even worse!</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Cry Out About Stolen Luggage</p>
<p>Under such strict controls, it would seem that large pieces of luggage sent from the ship into the warehouse and claimed the next day by returning overseas Chinese with their tickets should not be stolen or lost. But the opposite is true. With each ship arriving in Hong Kong, there are always hundreds of pieces of luggage that go missing. Passengers' luggage is sent to the warehouse, either east wing or west wing, upper level or lower level, for the passengers to find themselves. Passengers run up and down in the warehouse, rummaging through trunks and suitcases. If they find eight out of ten pieces of luggage, they may be willing to sacrifice the two missing pieces if they are not important, because they are already exhausted from wandering around the warehouse for half a day! This ordeal is not only experienced by returning overseas Chinese, but also by passengers who come to Hong Kong from Shanghai on an ocean liner that docks at the Kowloon Wharf terminal across from Hong Kong. Many people must have had such an unforgettable experience.</p>
<p>Coolies Demand U.S. Dollars</p>
<p>When passengers disembark with their small luggage, wharf coolies compete for business, originally charging fifty cents per piece but now demanding three to five dollars. From the ship to the wharf, from the wharf to the customs inspection station, from the customs inspection station to the outside of the wharf's iron gates, there are three stages with three different sets of coolies handling the luggage, each demanding a separate fee, even though the total distance of these three stages is less than three minutes! Why this short distance must be divided among three groups of coolies is truly "Heaven knows." The coolies know that the passengers are returning overseas Chinese, so they refuse anything but U.S. dollars. If you don't pay, they will surround you in groups of three or five, creating a threatening atmosphere. Of course, those who suffer are the people who are "alone and helpless"!</p>
<p>Unforeseen Disaster Causes Indignation</p>
<p>Having traveled thousands of miles to Hong Kong, and after experiencing the above-mentioned ordeals, can returning overseas Chinese finally breathe a sigh of relief and be reunited with their families in their homeland for the rest of their lives? No! No! No! They are destined to suffer. Being ridiculed abroad is not enough, being extorted in Hong Kong is not enough. When they take the train into the homeland, customs officers outside the platform have recently been confiscating the U.S. dollars they have worked so hard to earn over the years, because the government has issued a decree prohibiting the import of foreign currency exceeding one hundred U.S. dollars! This government decree is intended to target illegal merchants, but overseas Chinese who have made great contributions to the country on a daily basis are now suffering an "unforeseen disaster" because of it! If you were an overseas Chinese returning home, how would you feel when the money you earned with blood and sweat is confiscated at the very moment you joyfully step into the nation's gate after enduring so many hardships! What would you do! What would you do!</p>
<p>The government has clearly stipulated, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has also issued express telegrams to overseas Chinese organizations to the effect that foreign currency cannot be brought into the country. So, returning overseas Chinese "fearfully and anxiously" comply by carrying national currency, but the national currency cannot exceed five hundred thousand yuan. What use are a hundred U.S. dollars and five hundred thousand yuan? You may blame the reporter for being too foolish, asking why returning overseas Chinese cannot "remit" their money back to the homeland? Fine, if a returning overseas Chinese has a total of five thousand U.S. dollars, he will receive sixty million yuan in national currency when he remits it back to the homeland. How much will this five thousand dollars be worth in another six months? How much will it be worth in another year? If you have U.S. dollars in your hand, why wouldn't you exchange them all for national currency? Enough, the reporter is not a returning overseas Chinese, but having witnessed the various sufferings of returning overseas Chinese, one cannot help but express a few words of indignation.</p>
<p>Staying in Hong Kong to Reconsider</p>
<p>The reality is that returning overseas Chinese cannot return to the homeland to starve. After thinking it over, they all come to the same conclusion: to stay in Hong Kong first and then reconsider. If it is inconvenient to return to their hometowns, they can simply call their families to Hong Kong for a reunion. Anyway, they have money in their pockets, and if their property is protected, they don't have to worry about not being able to survive. So, the house that returning overseas Chinese originally planned to build in their homeland will have to be built in Hong Kong. The factory or trading company that returning overseas Chinese originally planned to open in their homeland will either not be opened at all, or it will only be opened in Hong Kong! In short, the capital that returning overseas Chinese brought back could have been the sweet dew that nourishes the impoverished homeland, but now it is prospering this "externally strong but internally weak" colony! Overseas Chinese return at an average rate of thousands per month, so in the past six months there have been six thousand people. And if each person brings back five thousand U.S. dollars or equivalent wealth, then there are at least thirty million U.S. dollars. Not to mention the continuous stream of people returning in the future! This number may not be large, but it is not "insignificant" either. On the one hand, we are frantically encouraging exports and attracting foreign exchange, and on the other hand, we are acting like wealthy sons and looking down on the wealth accumulated by overseas Chinese drop by drop. Is this really the case? The reporter does not believe it, not in a million years, but disbelief cannot change the ironclad facts. Therefore, in order to comfort returning overseas Chinese and enrich the country's wealth, it is hoped that the relevant authorities can think of ways to help returning overseas Chinese, including guiding them upon landing, handling cash, etc. Even if these things are not as easy as "breaking a branch," they are not as difficult as "moving a mountain," and a complete solution should be worked out immediately. What is past is past, but the future can be pursued. Prospering someone else's colony is a small matter, but losing overseas Chinese compatriots' nostalgia for the homeland is a major matter, and it seems that prudent handling must be requested.</p>
<h3>Peasant Tears at Hangzhou's Temple Fair</h3>
<p>— Hangzhou, 12th [Day] Dispatch from Our Special Correspondent, Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>The sun brought warmth, and the lingering spring chill was blown away by the warm breeze. The plum blossoms in Lingfeng, Hangzhou, are dressed up and smiling, the plum blossoms on Gushan are in full bloom, and the plum blossoms in Chaoshan are in full bloom, all competing for beauty. From the West Lake, following Shengtang Road to Lihu Lake, strolling along Jingjiang Road, a branch of red plum and a branch of white plum inside the wall of "Shenglu" have jumped out of the wall, filling the branches with flowers, and a fragrant aroma stirs up boundless spring sorrow. The old willows on Bai Causeway and Su Causeway have sprouted tender green branches, whispering softly to the wild grass. In the green wilderness, the yellow walls of the Buddhist temples are exposed. They are also tidied up to allow thousands of devout men and women to worship.</p>
<p>Swollen Feet, Shoes Dragging - Pilgrims to the Temples</p>
<p>Hangzhou's temple fairs have come with the arrival of spring, and the number of rural peasants coming to offer incense is greater than the number of people from major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai coming to enjoy the spring scenery. Many of these peasants come from Quzhou, Yanzhou, Shaozhou, and Jiaxing, and from across provincial borders from Suzhou, Songjiang, and Taizhou. In recent days, in the city of Hangzhou, one can see groups of peasants wearing short jackets of different colors such as blue, cyan, and gray, wearing cloth shoes, the women having combed their hair into buns, some wearing eight-panel red skirts and inserting flowers made of red paper. They all carry yellow cloth bags, with the words "Pilgrimage to the Temples" and "Pilgrimage to Tianzhu" printed on the bags.</p>
<p>Many of these pilgrims come by civilian boats, and some even walk. On the road, they do not eat any meat. Once they arrive in Hangzhou, the most important thing is to inquire about the route to burn incense. They are also organized, with one person as the "incense head," who directs and designs everything. Each person who comes to Hangzhou to burn incense probably contributes about a measure of rice. After arriving in Hangzhou, other expenses are handled separately. Poor farmers only blame themselves for not burning incense, so even though they cannot afford to burn incense, they still have to save for two or three years to burn incense once. In Hangzhou, peasants mostly walk to the various temples to burn incense. As we were walking on Bai Causeway, we saw several female pilgrims whose feet were already swollen and their shoes were dragging. We also saw eight or nine male pilgrims who used copper hooks to tie into the flesh of their arms, and used copper wire to hang a tin incense burner weighing seven or eight pounds, and walked forward in this way. It is said that this kind of behavior is to "fulfill a vow" and "make a vow."</p>
<p>The Fate of the Peasants - Ruled by Buddha</p>
<p>In this time when spring has arrived, it is the season for cultivation. How can they have time to burn incense? Originally, their coming to burn incense is also like the prayer before every event in Christianity, expressing a kind of pre-blessing. They seek the Buddha to grant them "flourishing mulberry flowers" and "abundant harvests," and even that silkworm cocoon prices can be sold high, and rice prices can also be sold high, and that after paying off debts, they can also add a few more clothes for the children. Of course, they do not know how to raise silkworms well or how to grow rice well. They only know that everything is given by the Buddha. Without the Buddha, everything is gone. They even only know that their fate is ruled by the Buddha, and that their fate is perverse, which is destined in the previous life. What grievances they have, what oppressions they suffer from the bullies, they can only turn to the Buddha for salvation. Because of the consistent habit that "the yamen is as deep as the sea" and "officials protect each other," they use the imagination of "Buddha" as a spiritual comfort.</p>
<p>Today, the world has progressed to the atomic age, and our peasants, who make up the majority of the people, are still so pitiful. Whose responsibility is this? We have seen this kind of pilgrimage since we were children. Who knew that it is still like this today? We are surprised that many people are talking about the rural economy and improving the rural areas, but why is the countryside still so undeveloped? We are even more surprised that the gentlemen who promote sericulture and improve the rural cooperative movement, why their scientific and rational power cannot break the peasants' concept of "Buddha giving"?</p>
<p>The Abbot Asks for Alms - Generously Donating</p>
<p>When they go to the temple to burn incense, the abbot takes out the ledger and asks them to write a little. Of course, they also generously donate, even if it is five thousand or ten thousand yuan, but these money are full of their sweat and blood.</p>
<p>In these days, the incense on Tianzhu Mountain and Chenghuang Mountain is the most prosperous, and of course the other temples are not bad either. The business of rickshaws and tricycles is not very good, and even boats are not necessarily doing well. According to an experienced boater: "Those who are relatively rich take tricycles, and the second is to take a boat together. Taking a boat is mostly along the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon to Jingci Temple to burn incense, and they will never go anywhere else. We can't earn a few dollars here." From these words, we know that the loyal, lovely and pitiful peasants are not "borrowing Buddha to burn incense"!</p>
<p>In the early days of the temple fair in Hangzhou, the store that probably benefited the most was Hu Qing Yu Tang Pharmacy. After the peasants asked for blessings from the Buddha, they also wanted to do their best. The best-selling items in Hu Qing Yu Tang Pharmacy are fever medicine and plasters, followed by medicinal wine, and then ginseng tonic pills or ginseng and donkey-hide gelatin. Because fever medicine can cure internal problems and plasters can cure external problems, curing both internal and external problems can be regarded as doing one's best. Alas! These millions of vast peasants are blindly fighting against the disease!</p>
<p>Willing to Compete with the Buddha - Improve the Countryside</p>
<p>It is said that pilgrims from the countryside will continue to come to Hangzhou to burn incense from now until the sixth day of the fourth lunar month. Those who come to burn incense at this time are all for silkworms. After they go back, they will call the people next to them to burn incense. After the "silkworms open the door" (that is, after the silkworms make cocoons and sell them), they will come back to fulfill their "vows."</p>
<p>Of course, we will not object to them coming to Hangzhou to burn incense, but after the incense is burned, what will the Buddha give them? At the same time, what should our local government give them? If the local government gives them benefits that they can believe in, then they can also play around when they come to Hangzhou, and will not have to come and go in a hurry. Therefore, we hope that the local government can compete with the Buddha for a while.</p>

<h3>On Currency Management and a Proposal to Issue "Price Index Treasury Bonds" (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Li Chonghuai</p>
<p>"China's economy is already full of holes, and the situation is dire. Mere criticism and blame will not help. I offer my humble opinion to experts at home and abroad, hoping it will spark constructive suggestions to address the current situation." - The Author</p>
<p>1.  The Announcement of the "Emergency Economic Measures Plan"</p>
<p>Following the gold and price surge around February 10th, the government announced the "Emergency Economic Measures Plan" on February 16th, including prohibiting gold trading and foreign currency circulation, strictly implementing price controls, coordinating the supply of essential civilian goods, strictly managing production, developing export trade, and striving for budget balance, etc. In terms of the wording of the plan, it seems to have considered all aspects of the overall economy. However, upon closer examination, one deeply feels that hidden worries abound, the future is fraught with crises, and it is just beginning. In the days following the announcement of the measures, it may stabilize finance and prices temporarily, as it is still a sedative for a turbulent society. However, in the near future, prices will likely continue to rise, and it may not be of much benefit to the overall economic panic.</p>
<p>The author believes that the flaw in the plan lies in its inability to effectively manage currency, and therefore, prices may not be stable.</p>
<p>2.  The Root of the Current Economic Problems</p>
<p>Before discussing the main text, let us briefly analyze China's current economy. After eight years of war against Japan and more than a year of civil unrest, the government's war expenditure has been enormous, and the production base has been almost completely destroyed. Government expenditures are usually covered by taxes, state-owned enterprise revenues, public debt, and currency issuance. Taxes are built on the foundation of prosperous production. Production stagnation and empty markets cannot rely on taxes as a major source of revenue. At present, state-owned enterprises are still in their infancy, and capital expenditures are actually greater than revenues. In a process of rapidly depreciating currency and soaring prices, it is almost impossible to issue public debt by ordinary means. Therefore, the only resort is to issue currency. Inflation is not necessarily a bad thing; if material resources can increase relatively during inflation, then prices may not necessarily rise. Planned, chronic inflation may promote industrial and commercial prosperity and reduce unemployment. However, conversely, if inflation occurs while material resources decrease, and the inflation is unplanned and jumps erratically, it becomes malignant inflation. The result will be to disconnect production from trade and promote a crazy rise in prices. The most obvious product of malignant inflation is high overnight interest rates. Because currency increases (assuming that the speed of currency circulation and usage habits remain unchanged) and material resources are scarce, prices soar, thus commercial profits are particularly high, which causes short-term lending rates to increase abnormally, causing people to be unwilling to make long-term and risky investments. Therefore, it is difficult for production enterprises to obtain capital, and it is difficult to add and replace machinery and equipment to increase production. If currency continues to be issued but production does not easily increase, then prices will inevitably rise. If prices rise, then the government will inevitably increase currency issuance. If there is no appropriate way to stop this vicious cycle, it will inevitably be endless.</p>
<p>3.  Currency Management is the Focus of Solving Current Economic Problems</p>
<p>In the aforementioned economic state, there are three key factors: one is the quantity of currency, one is interest, and one is material resources. If the currency is not continuously increased (hereinafter, all are relative), then prices may not rise again, interest rates can fall, and production can increase. If interest rates are generally low and flat, and long-term investment is profitable, production can increase, and price increases can be reduced. If the supply of material resources increases, the momentum of price increases slows down, commercial profits are viewed as lower, interest rates will inevitably fall, production can benefit, and currency issuance can also be reduced. If the quantity of currency, interest rates, and material resources can all be controlled, it is the best policy to stabilize prices. However, interest rates themselves are attached to the mutual relationship between the quantity of currency and prices. Therefore, the most effective method is to start with managing currency and increasing material resources.</p>
<p>However, there is also a distinction between importance and priority between these two. There are two ways to increase material resources: one is to import from foreign countries, and the other is to increase domestic production. The latter is restricted by interest rates and inflation, as mentioned earlier. Inefficient transportation mechanisms and the failure of goods to flow smoothly are also factors hindering production, which cannot be effective in the short term. The former requires a large amount of foreign exchange and friendly foreign donations. In the past, China maintained low exchange rates, which meant encouraging imports. However, with limited foreign exchange resources to supply unlimited needs, it is naturally difficult to maintain for a long time. Relying on foreign friendly donations and relief supplies is one example, but it is feared that it will not last long. The "Emergency Economic Measures Plan" seems to focus on foreign in-kind loans. However, it is currently difficult to be certain whether the other party is willing. Even if everything goes well, if currency is still issued without management, or the rate of increase in material resources is not as fast as the rate of increase in currency, then prices will still continue to rise. Therefore, what we can manage with greater certainty is the quantity of currency. The quantity of currency is the most important link in the economic system, and it itself has the power to control other factors. Neglecting this and focusing on that, any other measures will fail.</p>
<p>4.  The Way to Manage Currency is to Find a Way Out for Society's Surplus Purchasing Power (i.e., Hot Money)</p>
<p>What the author means by currency management is not to absolutely not increase issuance. Unless the country can be spared war consumption, it is impossible to absolutely not increase issuance at this time. Even if the country is peacefully unified, issuance will still increase in a situation where production has not recovered and everything is waiting to be revitalized. This increased issuance is originally the government's purchasing power created out of thin air. However, this excessive purchasing power is transferred to the people's hands, and there must be a way out for it. The outlet for the purchasing power obtained by the people (referring to income excluding donations and taxes) is nothing more than consumption, savings, or investment (collection is relatively small, so it is omitted; savings in a certain definition - as referred to by Keynesians - are equal to investment). During the war, the rate of expansion of fiscal deficits in Britain and the United States was far greater than ours, but the price increases were limited. The reason for this is partly due to the effectiveness of price controls, but the most important thing is that the people's remaining purchasing power, in addition to consumption, still has reliable savings and investment targets, either investing in industrial and commercial enterprises, or purchasing government bonds, or depositing funds in banks, and the banks then purchase government bonds as operating assets. During the war, this asset accounted for more than 60% of the liquid assets of British and American banks. These purchasing powers, on the one hand, increase production and the circulation of materials, and at the same time, through the bridge of public debt, enter the government's hands for re-expenditure. In China, it is not the case. It is difficult for the purchasing power obtained by the people, apart from consumption, to find a reliable outlet. China does not have a sound capital market, making it difficult to guide people to invest. The interest rate on deposits in national banks is too low to guide savings, thereby expanding production credit. The rate of currency depreciation is too fast, making it difficult to issue public debt. Therefore, most of the people's surplus purchasing power goes to hoarding goods, or depositing money in commercial firms, or even underground money houses and bill-splitting companies, etc. The former increases the need for material resources, promoting price increases, and the latter increases the expansion of speculative credit, which is also a factor promoting price increases. Therefore, the management of currency lies in how to absorb the surplus purchasing power of the Chinese people other than normal consumption and transfer it to the government. This is the purpose of this article.</p>
<p>5.  The Failure of the Gold Policy Lies in the Limited Amount of Gold Reserves</p>
<p>Let us first briefly review the policy of selling gold. The sale of gold, in essence, is nothing more than a substitute for government bonds. Because it is not easy to issue public debt, the government has to take gold to absorb the people's purchasing power. Originally, the value of gold is stable, which is in line with the people's demand to protect the value of savings. Currency is constantly inflating, and general prices are rising. The price of gold should be high, and if it is not high, it will not easily absorb currency. Therefore, the rise in the price of gold is not the cause of the rise in other prices, but a compass for inflation. If the price of gold has the same rate of increase as general prices or rises ahead of prices, it indicates that the price of gold absorbs more purchasing power in the market, which invisibly reduces the people's power to compete for goods. If gold does not rise ahead of prices, it can further prove that the rise in prices is not due to the rise in the price of gold. As far as we know, the highest price of gold in Shanghai between January and March of last year was 1,194,000 yuan per tael, and the lowest price was 795,000 yuan. The average price of gold in Shanghai from January 5th to January 12th of this year was 3,633,333 yuan per tael. Compared with the highest price between January and March of last year, it has only increased 1.9 times, that is, compared with the lowest price at that time, it has only increased 4.5 times. What about the price increase during the same period? According to the Shanghai Essential Commodity Wholesale Price Index published in the monthly report of the Central Bank, it was 92,842.5 in January 1946, and the average for January 6th to 13th of this year was 654,633. The latter is 7 times higher than the former. It is that the rate of gold price increase is not as high as that of prices, which is enough to prove that the rise in gold prices and prices is the result of currency inflation, and it is not that gold prices stimulate prices.</p>
<p>The use of gold policies is enough to absorb some currency and slow down the momentum of price increases. Impartially speaking, we cannot simply accuse it of being wrong. However, the gold policy ultimately failed because the power that gold could exert was limited by the amount of gold reserves. The authorities failed to consider this clearly, which was a mistake. The gold rush before and after February 10th was indeed stimulated by factors such as the issuance of large-denomination banknotes during the Lunar New Year, the promulgation of export subsidies, and the increase in import taxes. However, the basic reason is probably that the news of the emptiness of gold reserves leaked into the hands of speculators, which led to a rush to buy and raise the price of gold, and finally forced the government to abandon the gold selling policy.</p>
<p>The economy after the Central Bank abandoned the gold trading policy is worrying. The gold that has already flowed into the market is now freezing huge purchasing power. The exact amount of gold in the market now is unknown. According to the most cautious and lowest estimate, it is at least five million taels, which is worth 2.4 trillion yuan in legal tender at the current Central Bank's purchase price. Can the government bear this expenditure? If this huge amount of legal tender purchasing power is added to the market, what will be the impact on prices? It goes without saying! The safest method seems to be to suppress the list price, as a nominal purchase, so that this batch of gold remains in the people's pockets or in the safes of banks and firms. This may be the current policy of the Central Bank. However, the people are unwilling, and it is feared that the trend of smuggling will be difficult to curb!</p>
<p>6.  Review of the "Emergency Economic Measures Plan" - Still Lacking Tools to Manage Currency</p>
<p>Now that the gold open trading policy has become a thing of the past, let us see what effect the "Emergency Economic Measures Plan" announced on the 16th can have.</p>
<p>(1) Regarding budget balancing: It is feared that it is impossible for the government to reduce unnecessary expenditures. Even if it can be reduced, it is very limited. May I ask, if it is an unnecessary expenditure, why should the government include it in the budget? The author deeply fears that fiscal expenditure will not only not be reduced as a result, but may even increase further. Because managing prices, unified purchasing of daily necessities, and strengthening taxes will inevitably increase some institutions and expenses. Increasing taxes is by no means something that can be effective in the short term; sound taxes must be built on the foundation of industrial and commercial prosperity. In other words, we must first start by cultivating tax sources, otherwise it is digging flesh to repair sores and killing chickens to get eggs, which only reduces the reproductive capacity of industry and commerce. Auctioning off enemy and puppet assets can achieve the purpose of partially contracting currency and increasing material resources, but how much is the quantity and how to use it are all problems. Recruiting private shares for state-owned enterprises or selling them to the people also requires technical research. The government may not be willing to transfer businesses that already have income; the people will naturally not be willing to invest in businesses that do not yet have a foundation. Therefore, it is impossible to use these methods to seek current fiscal balance. Then there is no doubt that currency will continue to be issued.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding cracking down on speculative trading and stabilizing the financial market: Prohibiting the circulation of foreign currency in order to strengthen foreign exchange management is a step that the government should have taken long ago. Purchasing foreign currency at high prices can indeed reduce the black market for foreign currency and increase foreign exchange resources, but the Central Bank has to pay a price for the purchase. The impact of abandoning the gold policy has been mentioned earlier. As for strengthening the measures to control the financial market, it places too much emphasis on rigid political means, and it is also questionable what effect it has on price stability. The fundamental shortcoming of China's banking system is the disconnect between the central bank, commercial banks, and money houses. In other words, the overall financial market is not a mobile organic body. The central bank is only the government's bank and has not become the bank's bank. The main reason is the lack of an artery that communicates from the central bank to various financial institutions. In the British and American banking systems, this artery is government bonds and securities. This is not only the magic weapon for the central bank to use in the open market to expand and contract credit, but also a complementary tool for the discount rate and reserve ratio. It connects the financial institutions of developed countries and becomes the major blood vessels around the heart, allowing the central bank to freely control the expansion and contraction of market credit. At present, although the Central Bank of China has tried to achieve centralized deposit reserves, rediscount, and re-mortgage, and has also achieved considerable results in controlling the "quality" of loan credit, it is still difficult to flexibly control the entire financial situation because of the lack of this blood vessel that communicates the entire market. The rigid control of the financial market in the new plan further increases the separation between the central bank, commercial banks, and money houses, ignoring the chain of economic links, and restricts industrial and commercial loans too strictly, which may greatly hinder the circulation of materials. If materials do not flow smoothly, it will naturally be difficult for supply and demand in various places to mutually adjust. Furthermore, even if the financial market has been placed under strict management, the people's surplus purchasing power created by the government's increased currency issuance is fundamentally not in the hands of banks and money houses. Therefore, the government's management of banks and firms still fails to reasonably control this surplus purchasing power. What will happen to the people who use it to compete for goods?</p>

<h3>The Style of Gong Zizhen's Modern Poetry (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Yu Heng</p>
<p>During the Qing Dynasty, there were two outstanding and unconventional poets who truthfully repaid the artistic value of poetry with the vitality of their lives. One was the ill-fated Huang Zhongze, and the other was the unrestrained Gong Zizhen.</p>
<p>By the Qing Dynasty, poetry had long lost its true value due to the frivolous play and addiction to the format of examination poems, and had been misunderstood by ordinary "men of letters" who called themselves "poets." They regarded poetry as a kind of formal literature, neglecting the special content that poetry should have, misunderstanding the definition of poetry, and unconsciously believing that poetry was a boring social activity, a literary appendage, so the style of poetry became increasingly inferior. Even Wang Yuyang and Yuan Mei, who were famous at the time, could not escape this rut. Especially Yuan Mei, whose later works were entirely based on the background of sensuality and the Little Cangshan Suiyuan, and whose subject matter was social drinking with friends, was simply worthless. However, at that time, he interacted with all the dukes and "celebrities," and everyone strove to have their poems praised by the Suiyuan Poetry Talks, so the poetry talks completely became a world of conformity and flattery. This atmosphere of no right or wrong spread to the Jiaqing and Daoguang years, and there was even less talk of poetic principles. Fortunately, at this time, Gong Zizhen rose in the southeast and illuminated the literary world.</p>
<p>Gong Zizhen's poems are bizarrely gorgeous, heroic and strange, and unrestrained. The beauty of his mood is just like the praise he himself is very proud of: "Returning Yang and shaking Qi Sheng Jingling."</p>
<p>Some of the 315 poems in Jihai Miscellaneous Poems are difficult for people to understand after reading them, because they contain a secret love affair, so before we explore the techniques and implications together, we should first mention his love story:</p>
<p>Gong Zizhen was in the capital, and his official position was a member of the Ministry of Rites, in charge of the sacrificial department. Although he was an idle official in a cold department, because of his bold personality and love of oddities and hospitality, he naturally associated with princes and gentlemen. At that time, the Qingyuan King greatly appreciated him, and the Qingyuan King's Fujin (Princess) even admired his talent unexpectedly. The two could not help but exceed the scope stipulated by feudal forces and the etiquette and ritual norms. Gong Zizhen had a poem that was widely circulated for a while, "Remembering the Lilac Flowers in Taiping Lake inside Xuanwu Gate," which was actually written for her:</p>
<p>"Leaning on the empty mountain, I am tired of traveling. I dreamed of Langyuan in the west of the city in spring. A steed delivered a letter late at night to the Zhu Mansion, sending it to the person in white in the wind." Not only this poem, but also many "Remembering Luan Branches in the Capital", "Remembering Peonies", "Remembering Begonias", "Remembering Lilacs"... These are often unavoidable excuses, and the poem is:</p>
<p>It is a pity that there are no such flowers in the south, and their waists are slightly similar to begonias. It is hard to forget the house south of the Huai Market Street, where a cartload of drafts of various flowers is arranged in a small queue.</p>
<p>It is a pity that there are no such flowers in the south, and their beauty is even more extravagant than peonies. It is hard to forget the early return from the West Pavilion, and I gave it to the dressing table full of mirrored clouds.</p>
<p>It is not that these flowers are later in the south, but that there is a difference of two points between the fat in the north and the thin in the south. I would like to move the branch to the north to ask about the oil-green car in the Southern Dynasty.</p>
<p>I have been looking for fragrance for several years in my youth, with exquisite and beautiful jade intertwined. It is hard to forget the red mud temple in the drizzle, where I leaned on this flower with my spring fur soaked.</p>
<p>Although these poems cannot be regarded as Gong Zizhen's representative works, they are all climaxes in the Jihai Miscellaneous Poems and the most memorable page in his life. Later, when the Qingyuan King found out, Gong Zizhen was afraid of being victimized as a result, so he left the capital in a hurry (April of Daoguang Jihai). All of his infinite sorrow was written in the miscellaneous poems. Wu Changshou's Chronicle of Mr. Gong Zizhen did not detail the reasons for his departure from the capital, but only said: "His high talent touched the taboo of the times... so he begged to be allowed to return home to recuperate." This is naturally unreliable official talk.</p>
<p>According to legend, after leaving the capital, he encountered a swordsman who came to make trouble for him. Fortunately, Gong Zizhen, who "strikes the sword in his youth and plays the flute," was not a weak scholar. So he drew his sword and dealt with it, and the swordsman had to admit defeat. In the miscellaneous poems, there is the sentence: "Fortunately, you were born in a peaceful time, otherwise the peach blossoms would fall under the sword," which probably refers to this matter.</p>
<p>From then on, he never dared to go to Beijing again, but he still needed to welcome back the family members who had failed to travel out of Beijing with him in a hurry. So he sent a servant to the capital, while he wandered near Beijing, and finally did not dare to enter again. In his miscellaneous poems, he wrote of his frantic emotions at that time: "Looking north at Guling and south at wild geese, seven lines of cursive script reach the capital." "Gradually approaching the southern city, the sky is five feet high, and I dare not dream of Guling when I turn on the light."</p>
<p>Two years later, he died of a sudden illness. To this day, some people suspect that his death should be related to this matter, but unfortunately there are insufficient documents to examine it in detail. Fortunately, this is not a study of his life deeds, so let's put it aside and explore the flavor of his poems.</p>
<p>The uniqueness of Gong Zizhen's poems lies not only in the words and ideas, because the combination of beautiful words and meanings is not necessarily the best poem. In addition, there must be a special style that can express the personality of a great poem, that is, the style. Gong Zizhen's style can truly be said to be soaring and resounding, unlike ordinary vulgarity. His style fully expresses the integration of skill and talent. Let's take his two "Autumn Heart" poems as an example: "Autumn heart is like the sea and like the tide, only the autumn soul cannot be summoned..." and Wang Yuyang's popular "Autumn Willow": "Where is the most soul-stirring place in autumn? The setting sun and the west wind at Bai Xia Gate..." Compared with this, we can see the level of style. Gong's poems are like a swordsman staring intently with his sword in his hand; Wang's poems are like a shyly smiling daughter. The same use of words such as "autumn" and "soul" has different tones and different spirits.</p>
<p>The style of Huang Zhongze's poems is mostly sad and pitiful, such as: "The setting sun advises guests to go upstairs," "I am worried and think about buying poplars to plant," "The ghost envies the horse doctor at the grave," and so on. Compared with Gong Zizhen's "What sword is the cold northwest?","Beauty is like jade, sword is like rainbow", "The strong wind is strong and簸春魂", which can capture people's hearts, they are no match. Huang's poems are like Changji's ghostly talent, and Gong's poems are like the immortal energy of Qingyun.</p>
<p>I have discovered that there are two major 作风 of Gong Zizhen's poems, which are the bridges that transform the ordinary into the strange and the decayed into the pearls:</p>
<p>1.  Strange spelling: In ancient times, poets used must have a source for every word and phrase. If there was anything inappropriate, they would not use it. Because of adhering to the old rules, it was difficult for the qi to be broad, and the new creation of poetry became increasingly less. Gong Zizhen, on the other hand, is good at using unrelated adjectives or verb nouns, such as "Articles should have old waves," "The ancient makeup of the Six Dynasties lies in the dream," "Osmanthus outside the wind waits for the autumn tide," "The shadows of flowers in the four compartments are angry than the tide," etc. These are all wonderful combinations of strange spellings, which are the result of genius and skill, and often speak what the ancients have not said, liberating the field of poetry.</p>
<p>2.  Clever bifurcation: The third and fourth sentences of each quatrain often have a distance that readers absolutely cannot imagine. This is a unique technique of Gong Zizhen. For example: "For fear that Liu Lang's heroic spirit will be exhausted, he rolls up the curtain to dress and look at the Yellow River." The bold and unrestrained imagination is expressed in these fourteen words. Also: "A guest from the Guan Mountain reported in front of the door, come and listen to the sound of night rain in the West Zhai." "If Lu Ge is really in hand, he only begs to shine on the book city with his slanting intestines." "New poems urgently remember soul-stirring things, and share a spoonful of soup with rouge" are all written with inspiration that exceeds ordinary emotions. This kind of style has been rare since the Tang Dynasty.</p>
<p>In modern times, there are two people who extremely admire Gong Zizhen, Su Manshu and Yu Dafu. Their poems are very close to Gong Zizhen's style. Naturally, they are influenced by Gong Zizhen's style. At the same time, they are also poets who have written poems with life vitality with the vitality of their lives. They have successively died in this turbulent era, and we should also pay eternal remembrance to them.</p>
<h3>The Elegance of the Lotus Pond</h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<h3>White Gate Spring Colors</h3>
<p>— Qin Ling</p>
<p>Secluded willows, ancient dikes, emerald lake, green mountains—these are inexhaustible expressions of longing.</p>
<p>If you desire to reside in the most suitable city, then choose Jinling. It's both a city within mountains and forests and mountains and forests within a city. It's tranquil without being desolate, lively without being chaotic, possessing modern qualities while also retaining ancient simplicity.</p>
<p>My time living in Baixia (Nanjing) wasn't long, but I'm willing to share half of the affection Baixia has given me with you. It truly is a place with both mountains and water, magnificent yet delicately beautiful. In spring, the sunlight sparkles on Zijin Mountain. Riding in a carriage on the wide avenues adorned with green trees, the fields emit a warm, sweet scent of earth and flowers. From here, head straight to Ming Mausoleum, Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, Linggu Temple. Your heart will surely open up. Flowers and plants dance in the spring breeze, and the sound of hooves startles the butterflies in the flower bushes. The gentle breeze through the woods caresses your face; spring lives in your heart. Close your eyes and dream of a bygone era. If you're deeply interested, ascend the mountain path to explore Zixia Cave. Overlooking Jinling from here offers a feeling of floating in space. Do you believe it?</p>
<p>In summer, Baixia might be a bit hot, but so what? As the sun begins to set, the shores of Xuanwu Lake are filled with young people. I love this willow embankment the most. Fine willow branches, misty and verdant, embrace the lake. Strolling slowly along the embankment, the evening breeze gently lifts the corners of your clothes. The white stone architecture of the distant Five Continents Park lies quietly in the twilight. If you know how to row, hire a small boat and wander upon the green waters. Lotus leaves spread densely across the water's surface, and lotus blossoms peek into the boat. Stop rowing, hide yourself among the lotus flowers, and rest quietly for a while. The breeze from the water, carrying a faint fragrance, will wash away all worldly concerns.</p>
<p>And don't forget the reed flowers of Mochou Lake. Although Mochou Lake has a hint of solitude, its charm is quite profound. Qingliang Mountain, frowning at the lake, exudes a faint yellow hue. Clumps of reeds by the lake are adorned with a few white blossoms. And then there are the ancient pagoda trees in front of the Weiqi Pavilion—they belong to another world, secluded and detached in this quiet corner, with a faint sorrow, a subtle melancholy.</p>
<p>Also, be sure not to forget Drum Tower. The deep red walls are hidden in lush green trees, full of ancient charm. Below the tower is a pine forest. On moonlit nights, this is the most beautiful place. The towering red building has witnessed the vicissitudes of the ancient city. Surely, the past grandeur evokes a low, quiet sigh from the Drum Tower.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you have time, Jiming Mountain, Beiji Pavilion, Rouge Well, and Bailuzhou (White Heron Isle) are all extremely interesting places to visit. Otherwise, stroll leisurely through the small streets and back alleys. Won't the lanes of Wuyi (Dark Clothes) and the bridge of Zhuque (Vermillion Bird) evoke a strong sense of nostalgia in you?</p>
<p>Every morning, the sound of horses' hooves knocks on the window of the ancient city's morning dreams. Carts full of fresh fruits and vegetables are brought to the market. The carters' light, rounded, practiced calls echo in the clear air, giving people a sense of warmth and ancient simplicity. And at night, the bells of Jiming Temple are deep and resonant, urging people to sleep. This city, in every place, doesn't forget to remind us: "Its essence forever belongs to the era of our ancestors."</p>
<p>Spring has come. When the ever-smiling sunlight shines on Stone City, everything returns to life: birdsong, flower fragrance, mountain scenery, water colors. This ancient city has floated to the surface of a lake of happiness, bringing you my blessings.</p>
<h3>Gorky's First Work</h3>
<p>— Fu Bo</p>
<p>Gorky's first work, "Makar Chudra," was written during his vagrant years in the Outer Caucasus, while working at a factory, using his holidays. He personally delivered it to the chief editor of a newspaper.</p>
<p>The chief editor glanced through it and noticed that the byline was missing. He looked up and asked the waiting youth:</p>
<p>"No pen name?"</p>
<p>"No, write one in yourself—just use Gorky—Maxim Gorky."</p>
<p>The chief editor seemed surprised and doubtful at this suddenly spoken name. He frowned and asked:</p>
<p>"Is this your real name?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't want to give my real name. It's better to use a pseudonym."</p>
<p>The article was soon published, and the name "Gorky" appeared in the world for the first time. That was on September 25, 1892, in the newspaper "Kavkaz" of Tiflis (Tbilisi).</p>
<h3>Jottings on the Lake</h3>
<p>— Yao Yu</p>
<p>Spring</p>
<p>The gentle east wind blows the goddess of spring to the human world.</p>
<p>Spring is lively, full of vitality...</p>
<p>If summer is a robust youth, then spring should be a sacred maiden; if summer is a rigorous thesis, then spring should be a beautiful poem.</p>
<p>Spring is great. It turns the willows by the lake green, and also the small grasses in the wilderness. If spring had feelings and purpose, it should belong to everything in the universe. However, spring also brings people many "troubles." Therefore, I love winter, and I love the days at the end of winter when spring is about to come but hasn't yet. Murmuring Xin Qiji's lyrics: "Before spring comes, first ask: I resent it opening late, and then it withers and falls early; the news of this year's flowering season is certain, but I only worry about the wind and rain without a sure sign..." Who can remain unmoved!</p>
<p>"Contradiction," "love" and "hate," "joy" and "trouble" make up the greatness of spring, and also reflect the greatness of life.</p>
<p>If there were no "contradiction," "love" and "hate," "joy" and "trouble," this world would become a dead world; it is on this basis that people and people, people and things become more closely connected and understood...</p>
<p>We are currently in a turbulent era, full of contradictions. We need not curse, nor praise. Use discernment to replace numbness, and analysis should outweigh emotion.</p>
<p>Spring, let me cast aside my sorrow for the departed, and from the contradictions come to know what is "love" and what is "hate"!</p>
<p>Tower</p>
<p>I have loved "towers" since I was a child; I love the towers in the setting sun even more. Three or five eagles circle around the top of the tower, one circle, two circles, three circles... Strangely enough, I never feel lonely towards a lone tower. I often stare at her with unblinking eyes, until she enters the gate of dusk with the stars....</p>
<p>At this moment, I get up early. As long as I aim my gaze at the window facing the lake, I can freely gaze at the towering tower standing in the lake, and my heart seems to have faith and dominion.</p>
<p>She—the tireless guardian of the night—many of the miscellaneous trees and weeds by the lake have succumbed to last night's gale and heavy rain and broken, but our guardian of the night! Still stands tall in the middle of the lake.</p>
<p>I once imagined: if there were no tower in the lake, Xizi (West Lake) would become a soulless maiden, losing her allure and vital beauty.</p>
<p>Towers, according to legend, are used to suppress demons. Reviewing the story of the vines climbing high on big trees and the small grasses on the ground comparing heights, I feel that towers can not only suppress demons, but also suppress the shameful dependents and incite the despicable cowards in the human world!</p>
<p>I pray silently to the rising sun:</p>
<p>Let us universally build a "tower" in our hearts!</p>
<h3>Poems from Dream Outside the Tower</h3>
<p>— Xu Chengyu</p>
<p>Reply to Tieqiao</p>
<p>Magnificent clouds stretch ten thousand miles, pressing down on the sky,</p>
<p>The spring wind stirs the pipes of harmony, responding to the dawn.</p>
<p>To answer your heroic feelings, I crafted a beautiful verse,</p>
<p>Suddenly, a fine line arrives, complementing my newly brewed wine.</p>
<p>I did not meet Yang Xiong discussing scriptures, as he went away,</p>
<p>Let's share with Tao Qian carrying wine to me.</p>
<p>Drunk, how would I know that I am a guest,</p>
<p>Drinking with you with a cup of radiant jade.</p>
<p>Spring splendor is like embroidery, falling in colorful profusion,</p>
<p>Beautiful scenery is right before us, something for you,</p>
<p>People remember the sorrowful poems of the Three Xiang Rivers,</p>
<p>Poems composed with excellence like Xiumen's Eight Eulogies.</p>
<p>Seeking secluded spots, I wandered under the moon with Master Lin,</p>
<p>Listening to music, I secretly watched the clouds of the sea.</p>
<p>Knowing that the landscape is endlessly meaningful,</p>
<p>No need to hear the beauty of "Rear Court Flower."</p>
<p>You, sir, are especially rich in good poetry,</p>
<p>No need for your page boy Xiao Xi to follow when the poems are done.</p>
<p>Your five-hued brush is still full of heart,</p>
<p>A band of empty river under the moon resembles an eyebrow;</p>
<p>Your untamed melody mirrors a solitary crane in flight,</p>
<p>Do not sing of sorrow, or mimic the weeping night monkey.</p>
<p>All the more, I admire these poems newly grown strong,</p>
<p>Yellow silk newly cut from the young wife's words.</p>
<p>In the Gorges I have met you several autumns,</p>
<p>Your writing has been praised as equal to Cao and Liu.</p>
<p>The desolate homeland lies three thousand miles away,</p>
<p>Gazing longingly at Yuan Long's hundred-foot tower;</p>
<p>When will the seas be at peace, beyond the borders,</p>
<p>Last night I dreamt of taking in the capital in my dream.</p>
<p>On the day we return together in a spring boat on the Chu River,</p>
<p>Do not forget the White Heron Island south of the heavens.</p>
<h3>A Collection of Tolstoy's Sayings</h3>
<p>— Translated by Jin Ning</p>
<p>Those who do evil without knowing the truth, we pity their sacrifices, we grieve for them, because they only inflict violence on those who attack them; but those who know the truth and do evil, under a mask of hypocrisy, harm not only themselves and their victims, but also millions of others, but these are blinded by the lies for evil.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain and River, An Inch of Blood 200</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Let's go upstairs too." I watched as people gradually diminished in size. By the faint light from the street, I could gradually make out the positions of various departments in the hall. I had only taken two or three steps when suddenly everything went pitch black. The streetlights had also gone out.</p>
<p>"The power's out," I muttered to myself, one hand on "04's" shoulder, cautiously moving forward.</p>
<p>"No, it isn't," "04" told me, "there's still light by the self-ladder." "The Big Fool" calls the elevator the "self-ladder"; it's a new term he invented, probably by analogy with "bicycle."</p>
<p>"Are you going to the second floor or the fifth floor?" Someone asked me outside the elevator door.</p>
<p>The fifth floor is my temporary headquarters; even if I want to go to Mr. W's office on the sixth floor, I have to go to the fifth floor first, because the elevator only goes to the fifth floor. It's correct for this person to ask if I want to go to the fifth floor. But why ask about the second floor? Because so many dramatic changes had happened in the fire hall, one scene after another, it was somewhat like watching a movie, so I completely forgot what Mr. W had just said upstairs about the hallway on the second floor, which can lead to the room next door. Now, suddenly hearing this person ask about the second floor, I was a little confused and involuntarily blurted out this question:</p>
<p>"The second floor?"</p>
<p>"Yes, the entrance here is blocked by Japanese soldiers, so most of the comrades have gone to the second floor to go through the passageway and participate in the flanking attack."</p>
<p>When I heard this, I remembered what Mr. W had said about the passageway. I smiled at my own confusion and thought of Yaoqun and Hucheng:</p>
<p>"Did you see our young lady and..."</p>
<p>"Yes, they left early... They were as happy as if they were going to a fair."</p>
<p>"04" and I went to the fifth floor. The corridor still had low lighting to maintain some brightness, so I knew the street's current hadn't been cut. The darkness on the street probably meant the enemy had deliberately destroyed the streetlights to conceal themselves. I walked to the door of my room and was just about to push it open when I heard someone speaking inside. It was Mr. Hejian's voice, speaking rapidly, completely in Japanese. I understood that Mr. Hejian and Miss Pingzi were probably talking inside. I felt it was inconvenient to enter the room, so I turned around to prepare to go to the sixth floor, and instructed Big Fool to wait at the entrance of the corridor, and if anything happened, he could come to the sixth floor to find me.</p>
<p>"...chase to the entrance of Dongjiaominxiang, stop firing, leave two sentry posts, the main force does not need to return to headquarters, disperse and rest in various branches, waiting for orders..."</p>
<p>As soon as I entered Mr. W's office, I heard the tail end of this order. Mr. W was issuing orders on the phone and nodding at me, gesturing for me to sit down. Mr. Dai and Secretary Ma were also in the room, still sitting in their original seats, as if they had never moved. We all raised our hands in greeting.</p>
<p>"You've come at just the right time," Mr. W said with a smile after issuing the order, "we were just about to discuss the issue of whether to keep or abolish this organization, and I hope you'll participate and give your opinion."</p>
<p>"This probably needs to be asked of Mr. Hejian and Miss Pingzi," I offered this readily available opinion.</p>
<p>"They're both on the fifth floor," Mr. W told me.</p>
<p>"That's right, I just came from the fifth floor. Someone is talking in my room. Mr. Hejian and Miss Pingzi are probably there. Mr. Hejian's voice was very urgent, maybe he was arguing with Miss Pingzi about something. I didn't want to intrude, so..."</p>
<p>"What kind of relationship do Mr. Hejian and Miss Pingzi have?" Mr. Dai asked very cautiously. Mr. W probably hadn't had time to report Miss Pingzi's behavior to Mr. Dai.</p>
<p>"In some way, the two people seem to be cooperating," Mr. W replied concisely.</p>
<p>This sentence, if it were coming out of my mouth, would have to be transformed into at least three or four, even five or six sentences, and perhaps still wouldn't be able to be said so clearly and concisely. I felt very satisfied with this answer. Even if Mr. Hejian himself were here, he would probably only be able to answer in this way.</p>
<h3>Remembrance</h3>
<p>— Sha Lei</p>
<p>I remember too many people and too many things. I often feel the weight of my soul. Every dusk, in the sound of the night wind or by the fireplace, the remembrance of those old friends and past events makes me unbelievably weak.</p>
<p>Some painful memories are poignant, but some gentle old images hurt me even more. When the rich fragrance of jasmine in March accompanies those lovely faces and kind voices, I can't bear the burden of living.</p>
<p>I can't stand that kind of fragrance and sweetness, I tremble.</p>
<p>Therefore, you will realize that I am indifferent. I seem to have the forgetfulness skills of someone with neurasthenia, contemptuously shedding the burden of history.</p>
<p>"Yes, it was also such a rainy night, we walked under the dim streetlights, the two of us holding an umbrella with only half of it intact, we were all fighting to bear the rain pouring down from the half-broken part, we finally decided to take turns tasting that coolness..."</p>
<p>"We then went to the small restaurant," you continued, "we ordered so many chicken wings..."</p>
<p>"Oh, did that happen?" I replied very lightly, I won't go back to that big forest to discover those beautiful times.</p>
<p>I just watched silently, neither cold nor affectionate, I just want today to flow by peacefully, and tomorrow to be as peaceful as today. Remembering yesterday and fantasizing about tomorrow both make me heavy.</p>
<p>Sitting opposite each other in wicker chairs, everyone smoking a cigarette, listening to the noise in the teahouse that has nothing to do with us, this is my supreme happiness.</p>
<p>It is really gratifying that we can stand together again, because the broken time is still continuing, because your reappearance allows me to unload many huge buildings of remembrance.</p>
<p>I want to tell you why I like to keep the windows closed. Under the sun and the bright moon, some eyes and songs are often patrolling, among the many stars in the boundless dark blue, which one has not stopped in my dream?</p>
<p>Tomorrow I may buy a dark curtain, so that I can have a more peaceful rest. My friend, let me always be with you, on the opposite bank of my life. Your demeanor always shines with a child's heart, making me return to a childhood of unknowing.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou Talks Alone</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>Modern Christians no longer stubbornly deny science. They are willing to say that true science is in harmony with God's common sense, and they also cite that the first telegram Morse sent when he invented the telegraph was What Hath God Wrought. That means what great things God has done.</p>
<p>The conclusion of some missionaries is, of course, quoting Professor Simpson, saying: "Small scientists vilify God, but great scientists always agree with Christian views."</p>
<p>In fact, religious belief and other aspects of knowledge can be absolutely separate, not related to each other. The explanations of some missionaries are inevitably superfluous.</p>
<p>Einstein is a Christian, which does not impair the existence of his "theory of relativity."</p>
<p>Religious belief, from a certain perspective, is just the sublimation of emotions after being repressed. There is no doubt that musicians have contributed the most to this.</p>
<p>Blessed are those who have faith.</p>
<p>But those who have clear understanding are often in pain.</p>
<p>My reason is—</p>
<p>Knowledge is constantly changing and advancing with time and space.</p>
<p>And belief is based on eternal, hazy piety, constant and firm. There are no "why" words to ask.</p>
<p>"Honesty" can often defeat "hypocrisy."</p>
<p>Since the Three Dynasties, people have loved fame; what they love is often false fame. As the saying goes, "puffing up one's face to look fat," this is exemplified by the Qi people with one wife and one concubine described in Mencius's books.</p>
<p>If people can see through this falsehood, I think they can save themselves a lot of irrelevant trouble.</p>
<p>During the Han Dynasty, Zhao Tuo, the King of Nanyue, rebelled. This King of Nanyue's was about status and money. If he had been born in the 1950s, he could have gone to the United States to play. The reason for his rebellion was only to gain the vanity of the two words "Emperor."</p>
<p>Emperor Wen of Han was truly a remarkable hero. He sent Zhao Tuo a letter. He started off with a killer move. He said, "I, the previous Emperor, am the son of a concubine." Translated into colloquial language, it means: "I, the Emperor, am the son of my father's mistress."</p>
<p>Zhao Tuo's vanity was completely shattered. "Damn it, the venerable Emperor begins by admitting that he is the son of a concubine. Do I still need to rebel?" Without spending a single soldier, the ambitious man had no choice but to surrender.</p>

<h3>On Recent Developments at the Commercial Press</h3>
<p>— Black Star</p>
<p>I really want to systematically visit several of the more famous bookstores in Shanghai, and ask them how many difficulties they are encountering today with such difficult publishing conditions and such low purchasing power.</p>
<p>First, I went to the Commercial Press. The contributions of the Commercial Press to Chinese cultural history and academia should be unparalleled.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, their large-scale printing factory and China's only encircling library - the Oriental Library - were both destroyed in the flames of the anti-Japanese war.</p>
<p>The losses of these two units alone are already impossible to estimate.</p>
<p>The Commercial Press has a total of four institutions across the country, located in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Chongqing, and Beiping (Beijing), with the head office in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Shanghai head office and retail department are located on Shanghai's famous cultural street, the so-called Qipan Street (Checkerboard Street); the actual location is at the intersection of Fourth Road and Henan Road. Their editorial department is located on Avenue Edward VII, and the printing factory (very small in scale) is located in Wangjiasha.</p>
<p>The current general manager and director of the editorial department of the Commercial Press is Mr. Zhu Jingnong, a well-known figure in academia, who does not need our introduction. Former general manager Wang Yunwu is now one of the directors of the Commercial Press, and it is expected that he will be of great help to the future development of the Commercial Press.</p>
<p>The person who spoke to me in the editorial department was Mr. Su Jiqing, who only came to Shanghai from Chongqing a month ago. Mr. Su has always been responsible for editing the "Eastern Miscellany" magazine. Mr. Su has graying temples, which shows how hard he has been working.</p>
<p>I asked Mr. Su a few simple questions:</p>
<p>About the situation of publishing books recently.</p>
<p>Mr. Su said: We still publish one book a day now, but there are too many books that are backlogged and have not been printed, even books that had their paper plates made before the "August 13th" incident have not yet been published. However, now that the post-war conditions are better than during the war, the books can naturally be printed more quickly.</p>
<p>In terms of printing, the factory in Shanghai is now very small, so we still use the wartime method of contracting out printing.</p>
<p>Regarding the relationship between the Commercial Press and the authors, Mr. Su said that most of them are royalties, taking 15% of the selling price of the book, and settling accounts three times a year. Very few are paid by manuscript fee, and even if there are, it is 15,000 yuan per thousand words.</p>
<p>I asked whether the government could provide any subsidies to the Commercial Press, which had suffered too heavy losses during the war, after the "post-war recovery"?</p>
<p>Mr. Su's answer was negative. He said;</p>
<p>"The Commercial Press has decided to be self-reliant and does not intend to accept any subsidies." However, the Commercial Press has a certain relationship with the Ministry of Education, which is that all works of the National Compilation and Translation Bureau are entrusted to the Commercial Press for printing, and all printing and distribution are handled by the Commercial Press. The Commercial Press also pays the royalties for these books.</p>
<p>This is the only relationship between the Commercial Press and the government. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Intolerable City, Sighing Before the Painted Buildings</h3>
<p>— Zikai (Feng Zikai)</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Tree Planting</h3>
<p>— Shu Xiang</p>
<p>"Arbor Day" has passed.</p>
<p>Every time that festival comes, our local officials are very busy. This year is no exception. On Dragon Mountain in this coastal city, at around eight o'clock, there were already many people crowded together, everyone trying to see the magistrate's posture when planting trees. The magistrate's hands are really white, and it's difficult for him to use this heavy hoe to plant trees, many common people secretly said.</p>
<p>My humble dwelling is very close to the mountain, opening the door and seeing the mountain. When I saw many people crowded on the mountain, I naturally thought of the annual Arbor Day. However, every year trees are planted, but this mountain never seems to have more trees growing. Tree seedlings have almost become leaky buckets here, like pouring water on Cow Mountain, wasting the magistrate's efforts and the fresh tree seedlings in the farm.</p>
<p>Chinese people are good at bullying flowers and trees. Apart from public parks where there is police protection, wherever you go in the mountains and wilderness, you will always see many tourists who will casually break branches and peel bark. Even big trees are treated like this, so tree seedlings that are planted are either trampled by tourists or wantonly cut down by woodcutters.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, trees were the most effective protection. Adults and gentlemen could squeeze into solid underground rooms and air-raid shelters, but ordinary people could only hide under the shade of trees. Airplanes roared overhead, and bombs exploded all around. At that time, I really hoped that the leaves would grow denser and denser. When I lived in a place with barren Cow Mountain, the first feeling was disappointment, the second was hatred!</p>
<p>The flames of war spread, and the newspapers sometimes reported news of bombings and attacks in certain places. This year, on Arbor Day in our county, a meaningful couplet was hung at the entrance of the agricultural and forestry farm:</p>
<p>"Do not forget the wild cries of air raid alarms, when women and children carry each other, seeking shelter under trees.</p>
<p>It is essential to seek permanent national defense, join together and plant forests."</p>
<p>The effectiveness of tree planting, in addition to regulating water and drought, also has the meaning of air defense.</p>
<h3>Talking About Municipal Administration</h3>
<p>— Chang Liu</p>
<p>It was rumored for a while that Shanghai's public utilities were about to increase prices, but according to the official announcement later, "public utilities" are not allowed to increase prices recently. If there is a shortage, the municipal government will compensate.</p>
<p>Not increasing the prices of "public utilities" is truly a blessing for the people, and the people benefit greatly. However, the municipal government has repeatedly appealed to the city council, asking for additional budget, which shows that the municipal government itself is already in extreme financial difficulty. I wonder where this huge "public utility" compensation fee will come from?</p>
<p>We believe that Shanghai's municipal administration has indeed reached a stage of extreme difficulty. As Mayor Wu said to reporters, he himself really wants to leave Shanghai. This means that Shanghai's municipal administration is indeed not easy to deal with.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Shanghai is the economic center of the country and the largest international city in the Far East. The population has exceeded four million. The problems facing us, such as housing shortages, traffic congestion, rising prices, sanitation facilities, municipal reorganization, market control, and the municipal government's financial difficulties, will cause even people with the highest wisdom and talent to feel extremely headache.</p>
<p>However, standing in the position of a citizen, we should encourage every unit and every staff member of the municipal administration. Since Shanghai is the model for all cities in the country, we should fight against all difficulties with all our strength. Life itself is a "war"!</p>
<p>We should have the determination to only "win" and never "lose".</p>
<p>Someone once said that we should fight against the most difficult problems, and Shanghai's municipal administration is no exception.</p>
<h3>Picking Cherry Blossoms</h3>
<p>— Hu Lu</p>
<p>The Family of a Traitor Requests the Return of Valuable Furniture</p>
<p>Officialdom falsifies and is corrupt, undoubtedly furniture is mostly valuable. Gathering the tears of the people, shamelessly decorating the traitor's doorway!</p>
<p>Astonished by the strange request, how can they not know shame? The name of traitor, have they forgotten its filth, still wanting to savor it again?</p>
<h3>Love, Divorce, and Couples: Can Spouses Make Friends with Members of the Opposite Sex After Marriage?</h3>
<p>— Fang</p>
<p>According to news reports: Last year's divorce statistics in the United States show that most divorces were caused by one spouse forming friendships with members of the opposite sex, and most often, by wives forming friendships with men. At first glance, this news seems very strange. Who would have thought that in the extremely open social environment of the United States, friendships with the opposite sex would become the most common reason for divorce? In fact, the so-called friendships here have already exceeded the bounds of friendship. People often cannot distinguish between friendship and love. Coupled with misunderstandings and the decline of love ethics, triangular relationships are easily formed, ultimately leading to the separation of couples!</p>
<p>In our current society, the ethics of love are even weaker. In the commonly seen divorce cases, this kind of situation is certainly not rare, so it deserves our attention.</p>
<p>Originally, although friendship to love needs to go through a stage, there really isn't a clear divide between them. No one can detect themselves in the beginning of love; often when you realize you are in love, the "beginning" has already passed long ago. Therefore, friendship after marriage, without caution or restraint, can easily lead to tragedy.</p>
<p>First, we must avoid one spouse forming friendships with members of the opposite sex alone after marriage. The couple should be a single entity. Any meeting or correspondence with any friend should be together. Even a single, even secret, date or letter, will be a poisonous cancer, an unfortunate root sprout. If there are things that a couple cannot disclose to each other, then they should not have gotten married in the first place.</p>
<p>Love is inherently a sacrifice. If you cannot sacrifice your opposite-sex friends for your lover, then frankly speaking, your love for your lover is really superficial, blind, a love built on shifting sands. Friends! You must seriously examine and consider this, otherwise a rash union will only be the beginning of pain!</p>
<p>Don't seek solace from friends when there are quarrels between spouses. This not only does not help the situation but can easily stir up waves, because this kind of consolation is bound to receive a positive response. At this time, the person being comforted will definitely feel that their spouse is not as understanding as a friend, thereby deepening the rift. In fact, friends, try to reflect, anyone is always polite and gentle to members of the opposite sex other than their spouse. Once they become your spouse, things will probably be different. Moreover, your spouse, during the stage of loving you or during the stage of friendship with you, must have been able to comfort you better than your other friends, right? Therefore, when there are disputes, the main thing is understanding, not seeking consolation from others.</p>
<p>As a third party, you must not insert yourself into a couple's dispute. One-sided consolation must not exist, as it is harmful without any benefit. A couple's disputes can only be resolved by the couple themselves. Any external force only increases the disputes but never leads to a perfect solution. You should not have or maintain friendship with one spouse alone. You should regard a couple as a single entity, which will reduce many unnecessary misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Marriage is a cooperation. You cannot push the responsibility of happiness onto your partner alone; you must also bear half of the responsibility yourself. With mutual loyalty, mutual help, mutual understanding, and mutual tolerance, marriage will always be beautiful and happy.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: Mr. Fang's idea is that after men and women get married, they should abandon all their opposite-sex friends, or at least not allow you to interact with your opposite-sex friends alone. This point of view, in principle, is worth discussing; it is hoped that readers can offer some unique opinions.)</p>
<h3>The Sweetest Thing</h3>
<p>— Qing Tong</p>
<p>The American Chemical Society has received a report: Professor Weelert of the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands has invented a new chemical substance that is four thousand times sweeter than sugar. It is said that putting a tiny bit on the tongue will cause a sensation of sweetness for half an hour.</p>
<p>During the war, this invention was formulated in the Netherlands but was not revealed to the enemy. It is the sweetest of a family of seven brothers, the other six being from one hundred and twenty to two thousand times sweeter than sugar. Professor Weelert claims that other artificial sugars leave an aftertaste, but this one does not have this drawback. Another benefit is that its sweetness is extraordinarily high. Saccharin (a derivative of coal tar) is two hundred to seven hundred times sweeter than sugar, and Dulcin is even worse, only seventy to two hundred and fifty times. Compared to its four thousand times, the superiority is obvious.</p>
<p>Professor Weelert is a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Amsterdam and chairman of the International Committee for the Naming of Organic Chemistry. He believes that his discovery may alleviate the current global sugar shortage.</p>
<p>The Netherlands has begun manufacturing this newly invented orange crystalline substance. The establishment of a factory in the United States is also under discussion.</p>
<p>How this thing can actually be used still needs to be reported after testing. Moreover, actual use must comply with the regulations of many countries. (Translated from the second issue of the Beverage Magazine)</p>
<h3>Record of a City in Peril</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"They're going to Chongqing too. My cousin just left two months ago. He never mentioned this to me at all." Fatty Xu rushed to explain to Old Zhu for her. "Old Zhu, didn't you meet him here? It's Professor Hu, who studies biology all day long! He doesn't play mahjong, watch plays, drink wine, or want friends—a bookworm!"</p>
<p>"Oh! Hu Juewen. That's right, that's right," Zhu Zhaonian understood. An image of a short man with disheveled hair and beard, wearing a large blue cloth gown, immediately appeared in his mind.</p>
<p>"Letters going to and from the occupied areas are easily lost. Maybe Juewen simply didn't know we were coming," the young woman, called Lan by Old Zhu, explained. Her words were slow and clear, and her attitude was slightly reserved. "Mr. Zhu, I never thought I would meet you here! At that time, Li Xiang and I all thought you had an accident on the ship to Haiphong. Who knew it was a terrible rumor!"</p>
<p>Speaking the last sentence, her voice couldn't help but tremble, and Old Zhu's heart also trembled. He almost wanted to shout for a while, and wanted to rush over and tightly grasp the pair of hands that he hadn't touched for eleven years. In the end, he lowered his head in despair and couldn't speak for a long time.</p>
<p>"That's true. That year, many friends in Shanghai all thought you were dead. Who would have thought that two years later, you would still be alive and return, but it was your brother who really lost his life. Hahaha!" Fatty Xu, who was not concerned, found this incident quite interesting.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaonian slowly raised his head, looking at the person he could never forget and smiled sadly.</p>
<p>"Terrible rumor," he murmured. "This rumor has caused me too much loss!"</p>
<p>The young woman suddenly turned around quickly, facing the window, and remained silent for a long time.</p>
<p>Old Xu glanced at Old Zhu without much attention, and then looked at the watch on his wrist.</p>
<p>"Come on! Old Zhu, let's go drink!" He said cheerfully, "Although my wife is gone, A Shi's cooking is still good. Today, we're welcoming your sister-in-law, let's add a few dishes. Since you are acquaintances, it's good to have companions. Let's go!"</p>
<p>He gestured, pointing to the dining room on the left. Zhu Zhaonian nodded and was the first to walk out of the reception room. He did not look at the young woman again.</p>
<p>"Second sister-in-law, please have dinner. We'll discuss the car later." The host greeted. (Sixteen)</p>
