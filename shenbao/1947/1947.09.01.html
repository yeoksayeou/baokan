<h3>雅爾達秘密協定　使蘇聯把持東北　美報指責華府政策錯誤</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦卅一日廣播：前美國參院財政委員會主席喬奇，對全世界各國領袖發表廣播演說稱：「吾人欲冀蘇聯合作，殆不可能。德國之分裂與蘇聯控制中國東北華北及朝鮮，在目前已爲旣成事實。歐洲及軸心國和約之締結不能過於遲延時日，不管蘇聯意見如何，此　必須及早完成」。喬奇相信蘇聯旣不需要戰爭，亦未準備作戰，僅等待時機而已。按喬氏對於外交政策之見解常與白宮之意見脗合，故其言論頗値得重視也。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約卅日電〕中立性之芝加哥每日新聞社論，頃指出一九四五年雅爾達協定，在今日已使中國之局勢，益趨紛亂，故不能不認爲美國歷史上最大外交錯誤之一。協定內關於東北之條款，實使蘇聯把持界北。該報謂，羅斯福繼　曾同意將使中國接受此等條款，蘇聯從而已獲得其所欲者。戰事已獲勝後，始有蘇聯爲時約一週之參加對日作戰，「中國因而失東北」，而僅獲得美國空洞之援助保證。</p>
<h3>滬各大學校長電美當局　對魏特使聲明表示意見</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕上海各大學校長，昨日聯名致電美國杜魯門大總統，馬歇爾國務卿，參議院議長范登堡民主黨參議員巴格萊，衆議院議長馬丁，衆議院民主黨領袖雷朋諸氏，表示對於魏德邁調査團離華聲明之意見，茲譯錄其全文如下：</p>
<p>魏德邁調査團蒞臨中國，敝國人民曾以極大希望表示歡迎，深信調査團此來，將對敝國目前情形作一實在之考察，以期覓取實際可行之方法援助中國，因今日敝國一般苦難平民之所遭遇者，乃一事實問題，而非理論問題也。</p>
<p>吾人以從事於學術敎育者之身份，不得不聲明者，敝國之問題，質言之，乃一悠久之文化驟入於原子時代所遭遇之問題也。西方各國曾經數百年始克達成之現代情狀，敝國欲一旦與其相合無問，此一極難之舉，或非外人所能理解者。</p>
<p>抗戰兵燹所受損失　乃爲局勢轉劣原因</p>
<p>調査團蒞臨之初，曾向政府人員有如下之疑問，其言曰：「中國自一九三一至一九三七年間，曾有近代史上最大之進步，但嗣後局勢轉劣，其原因何在」？此一問題極爲切要，因過去數年中，政府之負責人員，類皆一九三一至九三七年間政府中之負責人員也。</p>
<p>然則，局勢轉劣之原因究何在乎？珍珠港事變前四年半，中國已單獨對日作戰，而在此八年之抗戰中，全國鐵路及物產豐饒之區，幾　皆淪陷。由此慘酷之戰爭，致令普遍蒙受物質上，精神上轉劣之後果，此殆爲任何國家在同一境遇所不能避免者。且一九四五年聯合國其他各國戰事終了，中國仍困於兵突，迄今未得蘇息。由於大量軍費之繼續支出及生產能力之運遭破壞，通貨急速膨脹，乃屬意料中事。然而，吾人之被迫首先對日作戰，今區使吾人之國土，成爲世界衝突思想之鬥爭塲所，此種命運，豈皆吾人自取者平？</p>
<p>中國政府於戰爭之初，對於是否應增加軍公敎人員之待遇，而使勢所必至之通貨膨脹益趨迅速？抑或聽任彼等掙扎於瀕臨飢餓綫之生活水準？曾極度躊躇。吾人對於任何形式之貪汚不法，決不寬恕，並堅決反對，但吾人對於實際增重吾人困難之客觀事實之存在，亦非視若無睹。</p>
<p>和平秩序未恢復前　欲求改善殆無可能</p>
<p>魏氏離華聲明申曾調中共若質誠愛國，並關心本國之福利，則應自動放棄以武力達到其思想之努力」。吾人今日實不敢存此幻想。魏氏續謂：爲重新獲得並保特中國人民之信念起見，中央政府應立即重施嚴厲及遠大之政治及經濟改革」。敝國政府與人民，自應作最大努力，以阻遏及挽救局勢轉劣之狂潮，但吾人仍當坦率承認，在國內和平與秩序未經恢復以前，局勢尙無根本改善之可能。吾人以爲，若僅恃上述建議，即欲謀敝國困難之解決，殆屬奢望。</p>
<p>人民希望美國援助　但須無捐尊嚴主權</p>
<p>敝國與美國之傳統友誼，已歷百年之久，敝國人民對於美國之信任與欽佩，誠出於衷忱。所以如此者，　因過去美國人民皆以公正之心對待吾人，無論兩國間有何顯著之差異，均必盡力以求瞭解敝國，且從未以爲惟美國人民之傳統·習慣。風俗與思想方法乃爲天經地義。</p>

<h3>鞍山鋼鐵工廠　步入復興途徑　烟雲籠罩工作緊張</h3>
<p>〔中央社鞍山卅一日電〕曾兩遭破壞之鞍山鋼鐵廠，今已步入復興途徑，自八月六日起，開始每日煉鋼二百噸，四百噸鍊鐵爐於九月底亦可開始其鍊鐵工作。以鋼鐵廠爲母體，環繞之鑄造鋼管等卅餘規模宏大之子廠，已先後全部復工，中國一切重工業之發展，亦將隨鞍山之復興，而邁出一巨步。記者日前隨資源委員會副委長孫越崎前往視察，置身廠內，惟聞機器開動之聲，錚錚砰砰，振耳欲聾，鍊鋼爐內火光熊熊，眩人眼目，尤以各軋鋼廠所軋之鋼條，有如無數火蛇，遍地亂舞，尤爲廠內奇景，各種機器配合之巧妙，工人技術之嫻熱，製造產品經過程度之迅速，使人益信强國必賴工業。當記者自瀋陽抵達鞍山時，遙望無數烟囱插人雲霄，大小工廠連豆數十里，無怪敵僞時期每以「鐵都」譽之，此寗靜淸淡多日之鞍山，畢竟在台人手中，重見烟雲籠　矣。現鋼鐵廠所屬各部門開始工作者，有煉焦，煉鋼，軋鋼，及鑄造鋼材，鋼管，鐵塔，鐵絲繩，鐵軌，鋼輪，橋樑等卅餘製造工廠。迄九月底，煉鐵爐升火後，過去鋼鐵廠之整套連環工作，即可完成。據某總經理云：明年可產鋼八萬噸，鐵十二萬噸，後年可產四十二萬噸鋼鐵，五年之後，年可產百萬噸，但完成是項計劃，必須有賴兩個條件，即安定與經費是也。記者兩日來遍走鞍山各廠，見過去日本技士及工人多已遣送返國，現所有機器全部爲國人所操縱，工作情緒至佳，當詢及彼等工作情形時，率多云「日本時候這些想幹也不讓幹，頂多不過給人家當個苦工而已」。鞍山之鋼鐵產量，在世界雖非獨步，然其他各種工廠配合一地而生產，猶屬舉世第一。鞍山之鋼鐵與撫順煤礦，構成「工業東北」之主要條件。</p>

<h3>在華沙紅色舞臺土　跳躍着的人物　波蘭行第四信</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　毛樹清</p>
<p>假如說：全世界的共產黨，都用同一個方法，黨握他們的政權，那末，在華沙，使我發生興趣的另一個問題，應該是誰究竟是波蘭的史達林？波蘭的鐵託元帥？</p>
<p>皮魯特大總統是波蘭天字第一號的老資格共產黨員，但是皮魯時本皆沒有「權」，波蘭政府裏的人說：皮魯特是一個好好先生，一個有「大度」的革命英雄。第二次世界大戰的後期，皮魯特曾經和「倫敦流亡政府」尖銳地鬥爭過，但是，站在幕後替皮魯持出主意的人，却是戈墨卡，現在波蘭共產黨中央黨部的書記長，一個陰深，機智的四十二歲的中年人。</p>
<p>波蘭老百姓現在都知道戈墨卡，與其說「知道」，母寗說「畏懼」我在華沙逗留的幾天當衆，和很多波蘭小伙子談天下大勢，他們一講到戈墨卡，都得回頭四顧一番，看看周圍有沒有「洩漏軍機」的奸細。他們說：戈墨卡的意見，現在大半可以左右共產黨的『中央政治局」，他常常『淸黨』，不但著共產黨濟黨，也替波蘭社會黨淸黨。</p>
<p>今年春天，戈墨卡發動了一個「爾黨合併運動」，兩個在的嚴峻反對，據說：社會黨反對的主因，是因爲「右派」在操縱，</p>
<p>這就是社會黨「淸黨」的由來。我來華沙這幾天當中，正閙得滿城風雨，蓋拉和其他許多人入了獄，正由波蘭的特種法許以一叛國罪」審判中。在外　記者招待會上，國際宣傳處主任葛羅蚩報吿這夥人數國的罪狀是：反蘇，反對現政府，從事踏殺及地下活動。</p>
<p>波蘭人稱這夥人，社會黨的右派，呌做wRN，我提請葛羅蚩主任詳細解釋所謂wRN的歷史根源和他們的性質，他們的政治主張，葛罷蚩的回答是：他們屬於波蘭社會黨的右派，波蘭社會黨有過五十多年的光榮歷史，但是wRN這一系，都是些頑固和反動份子，蘇籍帮助波蘭從納粹的鐵蹄下解放出來，這些人却堅持「反蘇」，因此，在盧布林革命政權成立當年，就宣佈wRN爲非法政治團體，蓋拉是其中首要份子之一。</p>
<p>有位美國記者，在記者招待會上問：有政治主張的政治團體，怎樣呌做合法？怎樣呌做非法？是不是因爲反蘇，所以確定它爲「非法」？當時記者會上的，空氣相當緊張，塔斯社的記者，抽著俄國雪茄，裝著沈默，那位藹羅　主任想了一下，他非常玲瓏的回答：黨派當然也有合法與非法之分，譬如說：「貴國（指美國）有一個呌做三Ｋ黨，人歡很多，活動也很多，但是貴國的法律，就規定三Ｋ黨的任何活動爲「非法」，波蘭的wRN也是一樣！』</p>
<p>我在華沙問過很多波蘭人，知道wRN的主要份子，抵都是倫敦流亡政府的過來人，很多是現在失了意的角色，他們的黨綱上，寫明白波蘭有兩大敵人，一個是納粹法西斯，另一個是紅色恐怖的蘇俄。</p>
<p>蓋拉受審的那天，社會黨的政府機關報，寫了一籟呌做「今後波蘭社會黨之途徑」一篇像宣言式的文字，裏面提到加强波蘇的友好關係，廊　黨內的頑固份子，以及「向資本主義默媚的傾向」。</p>
<p>這篇文章，應該算是社會黨的官方表示，事實上，第二次世界大戰以後的社會黨，在歐洲是一個共同的現象。我在法國所寫的通訊中，當經特別推薦過社會黨的老祖宗萊翁勃倫，萊翁勃倫是一個人的名字，也是一個自由主義和極權主義；資本主義和共產主義之間的一個符號。在兩者的矛盾沒有顯現的時候，兩者的尖銳關係還沒有爆裂的時候，這一個符號，在歐洲任何國家，都可以發生「橋樑」的作用。橋樑使法蘭西擠進了「四强」之林，使西歐和東歐的關係，得到了暫時的穩定！</p>
<p>但是，從杜魯門希土宣言以從，一直到這次巴黎會議東西歐璧壘的分野，社會黨的橋樑作用，在一天天傾坍和崩潰。巴黎的賴瑪迪，居然把共產黨趕出了內閣，華沙的共產黨自然也可以把wRN逮捕和拘禁。前任的波蘭國務總理阿素穆勒美斯基，因爲不贊成兩黨合併運動，現在在社會黨之中，再不會發生作用。現任的「禿頂」總理崔蘭克微契，據說是被共產黨認爲相當滿意的人物，至少，在戈墨卡眼光之中，崔蘭克微契是一個決不會反于蘇的社會黨中堅。</p>
<p>我會見過國務總理崔蘭克微契，但沒有會見戈墨卡。戈墨卡在中央政府中是「副總理」兼收復區行政部部長，位這些官街遠不及共產黨的中央書記長來得重要。我到華沙的第三天，請國際宣傳處的維斯渥，安娜克列斯朶夫小姐替我安排一次戈墨卡的「個別訪問」，她接洽了兩天，要我先看戈墨卡的私人秘書屠斯基先生，</p>
<p>共產黨中央黨部在史達林街十七號，英國大使館的對門，一座華沙市內相當巍峨的建築。紅色首部的門禁森嚴，使我驚訝，第一步須得在一個像「售票處」一樣的窗口，査對護照相片，然後給了我一張有一條粗紅斜綫的入門證，再經過兩通揹「熊貓槍」的衛兵的檢查，然後令我登樓，又經過了會客室的三位秘書的盤問，特別是我的報紙的立塲問題，和中國政府抑或中國共產黨有什麼關係？我吿訴她們：「申報是中國最老的報紙，早在民國成立以前，就有了申報。申報向來是一個獨立性的報紙，不是任何黨派的機關報。」幾位秘書聽了似乎很滿意，但說：「屠斯基先生很忙，今天恐怕不能接見。」我那時實在再也按捺不住，我說：「我是一個外國記者，我原來請求國際宣傳處介見戈墨卡先生的，因爲戈墨卡先生很忙，所以約定我今天先來看屠斯基先生的！」幾位女秘書，聽了好像很驚訝，看她們的臉色，似乎心裏在說：「你也配會見我們的書記長！」（未完）</p>

<h3>失學青年亟待援助　盼各地倡導助學　青年復學輔導委會負責人談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京卅一日電〕京滬各地倡導助學運動以來，頗爲社會人士所同情贊助，記者今訪敎育部「靑年復學就業輔導委員會」負責人，探詢對此運動之意見，承發表談話如下：「本學期業已開始，各地學生或因家陷匪區，或以遭受水災，其流亡失學未入學校者，因感就學之艱困。即原在各校肄業之淸寒學生，亦以物價飛漲，學校繳費過鉅，幾已無法繼續學業，瀕於重陷失學之境。而政府財政困難，本會以限於核定預算，本身未能特予淸寒學生以補助。惟深覺此項問題之嚴重性，有加無已，不容忽視，前經通令所屬各單位，聯絡社會關心靑年人士，及團體，設立淸寒學生救濟服務機構，以輔政府力量之不足，半年來獲得救濟之靑年，不下十五萬人。現京滬各地，發動助學運動，故値得擴大倡導，其他省市，亦不乏有力量及同情學生人士，祗以無人倡導，未能興起發揮義舉，本會近特再電各省市輔導處，飭迅聯絡各界發起助學運動，向社會各方面擴大宣傳，勸募助學金並鼓勵學生爲社會服務，以自助人助，完成學業，蔚為國用，並以此列爲各輔導處成績之一“深盼社會人士及新聞界，多予倡導協助，則嘉惠靑年，良非淺鮮」。</p>

<h3>記者節感言</h3>
<p>九一記者節，是我們報人自己的節日，一年一度，實爲我們報人作自我檢討的絕好機會。</p>
<p>我國新聞事業向稱落後，不論在內容方面或技術方面，與報業先進各國相較，‘均瞠乎其後。但在抗戰期間，經過全國報人八年來的刻苦努力，已獲得長足的進步。雖因物質條件的欠缺，我國報紙的外表，尙難充分表現現代報業的特色，但在內容方面，多少已能收到現代報紙對於政治經濟社會文化的功效。不但能反映輿論，作爲民衆的喉舌，抑且能以最迅速的方法，報道正確消息，成爲知識份子一日不可缺少的精神食糧。可是無諭如何，中國報業仍是落後的。且從大體上說，中國報業正循着資本主義的原則而進展，走着英美的路綫。但放眼看看世界各國報業的情形，很明顯的有着兩種新的趨勢。</p>
<p>第一是國際新聞自由運動。世界各國現在莫不要求國際新聞自由。綠在大戰期間，各國有識之士，經過這次大戰慘痛的敎訓，均認爲大戰的禍根埋在戰前國際新聞的隱秘與僞裝，戰後如欲締造世界和平，且希望其能維持久遠，則必須謀得國際新聞的自由。只要是現任新聞記者，就可以到世界任何一國，自由採訪新聞，不受任何限制，自由傳遞消息，不受當地當局的任何千涉，並可自由刊載，也不受任何方式的檢査。這眞是一個劃時代的國際運動，除了蘇聯一國而外，其他各國大半都已參加了。果能各國都毫無保留的辦到，那不僅可以視爲一種和平運動，而且也是報界的一大革新運動。</p>
<p>第二是國內言論自由運動。一般愛好和平的人士，往往認爲戰後世界如欲踏入和平民主的新時代，則各國國內言論自由，也是一個不可缺少的條件。言論自由，是民主政治的生命，沒有言論自由的國家，則其政治即無民主可可言。政治設施，如果不許人民自由發表批評的意見，政治也就不會有進步。人民發表意見，除民主國家的議會而外，報紙就是表達民意唯一的工具。所以戰後各國，莫不要求國內言論自由。</p>
<p>我國報業受了國際潮流的激盪，也正向着這兩個目標努力邁進；而且最近幾年來，經過我國報人的不斷努力，不論是對於國際新聞自由運動或是國內言論自由運動，都已有相當的成就。但所謂自由，決非一任我們做記者的衝破藩籬，隨心所欲之謂。古人所謂「一言興邦，一言喪邦」，現代何嘗不如此？記者的一枝筆，不但有關於當前國家的榮辱，世界的安危，而且其影響所及，人類的運命亦繫於報人之手。民主國家重視輿論，任何施政方針，悉以興論的向背爲依歸。報人所負的責任愈大，報人的善用其自由亦益難。因此，我們對於培養記者人才的新聞敎育，不得不請求政府特別加以重視。</p>
<h3>美國對華究將如何？</h3>
<p>上海各大學校長昨日聯名致電美當局，對於魏德邁特使離華時所發表的聲明，有所論列，並發表主張，歡迎美國合作，但爲中美兩國永久友誼計，美國如果援華，應尊重中國有自尊心的人民之尊嚴與主權。這個電報的全文，文詞委婉，意義嚴正，理直氣壯，不亢不卑，確能表達中國人民的眞意。我們讀了這個電文以後，亦願再述我們之所感。</p>
<p>此次魏德邁特使來華調査，東奔西走，時達一月，是否已盡其「博訪週諮」的能事，誠不能令人無疑。上海各大學校長，爲我國從事文敎工作者的前輩，在社會上均處於領導地位，他們的意見，宜為美國朝野所重視。而魏特使三次來滬，究竟延見了幾位校長，究竟探問了這些學者的意見沒有？他們的意見，旣無機會直接面吿魏特使，自然祗有率直的向美國當局一吐了。美國是民主國家，一切施政方針，悉視民意的向背爲依歸。上海各大學校長的意見，實可代表上海大多數智識份子的意見，不僅可作魏特使革擬報告書時的重要資料，也可供杜魯門總統，馬歇爾國務卿，及國會議員諸君研討對華政策時的參</p>
<p>上海各大學校長的電文既已發表，其他地方的文敎人士以及上海其他各界的領袖們，讀了魏特使的離華聲明以後，究竟作何感想，對於政府有何督責，對於美國有何期待，似乎也不會默爾而息。政治是衆人之事，民主政治尤其要尊重真正能代表大多數人的意見。國家大局到了現在的嚴重關頭，如果社會人士還是漠不關心，若秦人視越人之肥瘠，那纔是眞正怪事！</p>
<p>各大學校長的電文中說，「吾人被迫與日本作戰先於各國，且使我國土成爲思想衝突之鬥爭塲所，此抓命遝，豈皆吾人所自取」？關於這一點，不啻暗示了中國戰亂的國際因素，但說話過於含蓄，我們認爲猶有補充的必要。</p>
<p>我們以爲魏特使此次來華調査事實，最大的忽略之點，乃在其未注意及中國發生戰亂的國際因素，及中國在遠東所處的重要地位。誠如中國中史學家傅斯年氏所說：「魏特使在度量中國局勢時，對於中國應在東方反共及注視蘇聯有所舉動一點，未有充分之認識」。老實說，遠東局勢發展到此地步，美國對於中國應負其道義上的責任。前中正大學校長胡先　氏說：美國「竟爾違背開羅會議之宣言，私與蘇聯訂立雅爾達協定，出賣中國。」這種說法，即在美國輿論界，也有同感的。例如中立性之芝加哥每日新聞報，於前日發表社論，也指出雅爾達協定，在今日已使中國局勢益趨紛亂，故不能不認爲美國歷史上最大之外交錯誤。中國共匪若無蘇聯的支持，則早已可以獲得解決了。至於中國遠在美國大唱「中立法案」的時候，早與日本軍閥作殊死戰，在第一綫上阻遏了日本征服亞洲征服世界迷夢的實現，以致八年久戰，疲憊不堪。而目前美蘇兩國，由思想的衝突，演變而至世界鴻溝界鴻溝的劃分，中國又適逢其會，介於兩者之間。那麽，美國之援華，實際上應該視爲美國世界政策之一環。</p>
<p>要之，中美兩國的邦交，遭遇到一重新的考騐。遠東局勢乃至世界大局，也正在急劇的轉變中。美國的遠東政策，不論爲遠東的和平計，或是爲美國的利益計，都不容美國再鑄成外交上的大錯的了！</p>

<h3>十一國會商對日和約　蘇聲明不擬參加　堅持應由外長會議討論</h3>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科卅一日電〕蘇聯已於八月二十九日就美國八月十三日勸其參加日本和約預備會議之照會提出備忘錄，堅持對日和約應先由外長會議進行初步工作。該備忘錄認爲中國係外長會議之一員，故對日和約更有充分理由由外長會議先行決定。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦卅一日電〕蘇聯於今日聲明不擬參加十一國之日本和約會議，亦不擬簽字於此會所草之和約，祗願簽字於外長會議所草之和約。蘇名敎授李明於莫斯科電台之星期英語廣播節目中宣稱：美國建議召開十一國日本和約會議，違背波茨坦協定，一切和約之初步細則，應由外長會議起草。蘇聯不承認此等會議，亦不擬派員參加。蘇聯更不擬簽字於此一會議起草之和約，希望美國注意及此。在蘇聯與日本間尙有戰爭狀態存在之期間與日本訂立和約，就技術上言，確爲一齣喜劇。以言在康白拉舉行之所謂英共和邦日本和約會議。余誠不解彼等希望得有何種成就，鑒日本之獨裁者麥克阿瑟願鄭重考慮此會之建議乎。蘇聯不問此等手段能拖延日本之和約至如何之久，第覺蘇聯祗能承認外長會議為起草日本和約之唯一機構，此乃吾人之最後表示。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓卅一日電〕今日據悉，澳洲代表團與美國政府數度　商對日和約問題，意見發生衝突，澳洲方而堅持對日和約應能提供長期佔領日本之保證，而美方殆擬在今後兩年內撤退駐日美軍。澳洲某官員頃向記者聲稱，日本擁有人口八千萬，澳洲　僅八百萬，數目懸殊。美國當初主張佔領德國廿五年，但又擬在兩年內退出日本，前後政策互相矛盾，深信日人現正等待時機，準備重新控制遠東，不幸言中，澳洲命運　堪設想。美國政策無　使日本席於與一九二〇年德國同樣有利之地位，但結果德國得以逐漸復原，造成第二次世界大戰，殷鋻不遠，愼勿再覆轍。</p>
<h3>英共和邦會議代表表示　反對美對日貸款　但贊成准許日本經濟獲得自立</h3>
<p>〔路透社康白拉卅日電〕出席英共和邦日本和約會議之代表於私人談話之際，對於權威方爾所傳麥帥總部準備建議使日本獲得貸款五億美元以發展其對外貿易之議，均表示堅決之反對。據云，麥帥總部之建議，乃爲以日本之金銀作爲貸款之抵押品，凡在盟國及中立國內之日本貿易商，均可聲請利用此一貸款。英共和邦會議雖未正式討論此一建議，然各代表則認盟國雖應准許日本經濟得以自立，然麥帥總部建議之貸款，則非共和邦諸國所贊成。</p>

<h3>英國將裁軍　明年三月減至百萬</h3>

<h3>越南實地視察記</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員吳嘉棠西貢航訊</p>
<p>在越盟軍之手溜彈，法軍之機關槍以及西貢香檳酒瓶之爆破聲，雜然並作之際，吾人已聞法國殖民地帝國主義之喪鐘鳴矣。在西貢一地，越盟特工所擲手溜彈之爆炸聲，幾如香檳酒瓶之爆破聲，到處可聞”不足爲奇。於此交響奏鳴中，亞洲民族已攘臂而起，爲民權與自由而奮鬥矣。害人試就越南以觀察東南亞各地所發生之民族騷動情形，其動機不一而足，至其動機是否純正，似可不必顧問。但此類民族騷動，在東南亞各地均已獲得成功，則已爲顯明之事實。</p>
<p>越盟與法國之紛爭已使法國殖民地中最富饒之法屬越南瀕於破產狀態。法屬越南在戰前每年輸出白米約一百五十萬噸，今日茍能輸出十萬噸，法國已屬大幸。越南所產白米向由西貢轉往國外，今因受越盟遊擊戰之影響，此項食米出口，幾已全部切斷。縱令少量食米能越過遊　機而達西貢之碾米廠，則該碾米廠常遭越盟特工縱火焚燬。如食米已經碾過，則此單特工必設法將運米船擊沉。最近有法船六艘，駛至西貢準備運米，結果未載粒米而難去。</p>
<p>越南僑胞因戰事與騷亂而蒙受慘重損失。該處碾米廠什九爲華僑所開辦，現多數均已停閉，一籌莫展，祗有靜待和平之恢復。</p>
<p>越南橡皮種植之情勢，亦可說明越盟焦土政策何以能摧毁法國之殖民地經濟。越南在戰前每年輸往法國及美國之橡皮約有十萬噸之譜，自法越戰事發生以後，橡皮生產幾已全部停頓。越盟遊擊隊採取焦土政策，已將多數橡皮園加以毁損。據某權威方面估計，目前種植之橡皮園僅及百分之六十，其中生產橡皮者僅佔百分之二十一。本年度法人所能輸出之橡皮至多二萬五千噸。據專家估計，越盟軍所破壞之橡皮園約需十年始能復原。記者等抵達西貢前一星期越南最大橡皮園之一，雖有法兵守衛，內有法籍種植家四人被越盟特工所殺害。此四人係最近由法人遺至越南者，自此事發生後，法國橡皮種植家咸裏足不前，不敢前往越南工作矣。</p>
<p>法國殖民經濟之面臨破產，越兩之煤產要亦爲另一因素。法屬越南在戰前年產煤斤約二十萬至三十萬噸，其中一部分輸出國外，（此項東京煤在戰前經常有大量運往上海。）但目前越南煤礦所產生之煤斤較之戰前僅及百分之十至十五。</p>
<p>法人爲維持越南之經濟命脈起見，對輸出品及外匯實施種種嚴峻之統制辦法。越幣對美元之折合率雖經規定爲七對一之比，但黑市匯率則爲越幣三十五元折合美元一元，外匯之核給祗限於越南所缺乏之極必需物品，以至多數日用必需品在越南無法取得。</p>
<p>此次越南社會及經濟之重大變動，幕後策動之人實爲越盟領袖胡志明，胡氏曾被目爲與共黨沆瀣一氣，但渠竭力否認直　或簡接與共黨有何關係。胡氏於接見中國賓客時，常手執「三民主義」一書，以示渠爲國你學說之信徒，但據悉其屬僚中之敎育部長乃係在中闕訓練之中共份子。胡氏對於提高越南人之生活程度究有若何建樹，於對五十年來被統治於法國殖民地政府之越南人民，究能給予若干自由，欲於此時遽下論斷，尙嫌過早。</p>
<p>法越相爭，華僑遭池魚之殃，華僑聚居越南各地，單以西貢一地而論，共有華僑六十萬人，大部分居住於堤岸一帶。華僑中頗多富商，擁有鉅大之經濟利益，但大多數爲小商人及農民，知識程度極爲低落，因郵遞遲滯及缺乏運輸工具之故，平時與祖國甚鮮接觸。有一極重要之計劃，我政府當局應即付諸實施者，厥爲提高越南華橋之敎育程度與建立現代運輸路綫，如中國航空公司所設計之空運事業是。此條航空綫一旦開闢以後，則越南華僑必與祖國發生更密切之聯繫，可以斷言也。</p>
<p>就一般而論，越南大多數華僑對中國政局發展情形，鮮加注意，當地人士雖有閒談民主同盟，共黨及國民黨之種種政治活動者，但多數華僑大半僅營營於謀生之事。</p>
<p>本年四月間共產黨報紙「越南日報」因汚辱蔣主席，經中國總領事尹鳳藻請求後，即被禁止出版。此刻則共黨正出版一種地下出版物，名稱爲「新苗」。目前越南民主同盟之勢力依然有限，現正徐圖發展。</p>
<p>記者等留居西貢期間，曾受當地僑胞之盛大歡迎，彼等咸抱一種熱望，切盼在中航公司開闢直達航空綫以後，可與祖國發生更密切之聯繫。西貢總領事及商會主席洪淸凉曾舉行盛大茶會，歡迎中航公司全體人員。（八月廿五日）</p>

<h3>當前全国经济困难中　需要人民与政府合作　方顯廷播讲「经济困难中大家的责任」</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報昨日假座大中華大陸電台，舉辦第二十二次星期日特別廣播，請中國經濟硏究所代理所長方顯廷播講「經濟困難中大家的責任」，茲紀錄其演詞大意如下：</p>
<p>勝利已經兩年了，今天國內的局面，在經濟上困難的程度，比抗戰時期還要加重，這是任何人沒有預想到的。經濟險惡的象徵，人民痛苦的根源，在於不住上漲的物價問題。物價之所以漲，在於鈔票發得太多，而鈔票之所以發得多，又因爲政府的財政收支不能相抵，不能不靠發鈔票來彌補。但是鈔票發多了，物價上漲了，政府購買實物如軍糧軍服等所需要的錢更多了，同時公敎人員和將士的待遇也隨着調整了，所以政府的支出更加增大；而收入則因物價漲反使實値降低；故收支愈不相抵，所要增發的鈔票數量愈多。這樣，鈔票越發越多，物價一漲再漲，就成功了一個惡性循環。這是我們幾年來所目覩身受的痛苦事實。</p>
<p>物價如何維持不變</p>
<p>追根溯源解決問題的辦法，就是如何使政府增發鈔票以後，物價仍能維持不變，或僅上漲甚微。這樣，使政府下天不必再增發鈔票，或所需要增發的數量越來越少。然要維持物價不變或僅輕微的上漲，最根本的辦法，必須政府增發鈔票以後，能够馬上又從人民手中把鈔票收回來。使人民手中的購買力，轉移爲政府所有，讓政府來購買貨物。這種收回鈔票的方式，有租稅，有公債，有特種捐獻等。租稅和公債是英美各國所通行的主要方式，我國稅制不健全，利得稅所得稅不大行得通，公債也推銷不動，所以政府只好利用拋售黄金，出售敵產及剩餘物資等，來收回法幣；然這些物資有限，而政府膨脹通貨的需要太大，這種辦法馬上就宣吿失敗了。</p>
<p>其次，如果隨着通貨數量的增加，物資生產數量也可急劇增加，物價亦不致上漲得太厲害。因爲物價是貨物和法幣的對比，法幣多貨物同樣的多，平均物價也不會上漲。本來，在通貨開始膨脹與物價上漲時，對於生產的增加是有刺激作用的。因產品漲價，原料原光買來的價格低，工資短期內是固定的，故工業生產利潤加大，企業家一致都要擴張生產的。但在通貨繼綾膨脹下，這種有利的擴充，有它一定的限度。因大家擴充生產，爭購原料，原料價格不久就上漲了；又因一般物價漲，工人也要求提高工資了，到了相當時期以後，原料工資的相對價格，可能比產品的價格還要漲得快漲得高，也就是說，工業生產出來的產品售價，還抵不上它的再生產成本，因而使它繼續生產不但無利潤反而要虧本了。這時他們囤積原料，再按高價出售原料，還比從事生產有利。如果政府再給他們低利貸款購買原料，則他們囤積原料的利益更大，因此大家就要競相囤積原料，這時生產不但不能增加，反而要减少。根據我們的統計，在抗戰時期民國三十年重慶就到了這個階段，戰時上海自三十三年起也到了這個階段。這樣，通貨數量增加了，物資數量减少了，更加重了物價上漲的程度。</p>
<p>貧者愈貧富者愈富</p>
<p>戰後我國工業生產的另一個厄運，就是政府外匯政策的錯誤，所給工業生產的打擊。民國三十五年初，對外貿易恢復，政府把法幣的對外價値定得很高，規定對美匯率爲一元美鈔對二〇二〇元法幣，在這種匯率之下，故低廉的美國貨物，大量進口，當時又沒有實行輸入管制，因此國內工業生產受到價廉物美的洋貨競爭，大有崩潰的危險了。當時政府如此作法，也是想藉低廉的洋貨入口，來壓平國內的物價；結果物價雖獲暫時的穩定，但不到幾個月政府大量的外匯資源快花光了，洋貨進口不能不加管制了，終於造成去年冬季後物價的跳漲；而因外匯枯竭，目前工業所需的各種原料與生產品都不能有足量的輸入，生產更陷入窒息狀態。今年上半年來物價陡漲到幾萬倍，過去政策的錯誤實不能辭其咎。</p>
<p>前面說過，物價漲得越高，通貨發得越多，這裏面就產生了一個極不合理的分配間題。我們知道，通貨等於入頭稅，不論貧富是一律負擔相同數額的，結果已使愈有錢的人，所感覺的負擔愈輕；而同時在通貨膨脹過程中，政府雖有管制而未能澈底，有錢階級乃能利用物價暴漲的機會，從事投機事業，囤積居奇，大賺其錢；所以形成貧者愈貧，富者愈富。再加上政府各種低利生產貸款，過去黄金外匯買賣政策，都是使豪富人們得到最大方便，更造成了財富大量的集中。</p>
<p>共同努力克服困難</p>
<p>在舉國經濟極度混亂與痛苦的景况中，魏德邁使團的來華，給人民曾經帶來了一度希望，以爲美國可以帮助我們克服經濟困難了，其實這種希望是最傷失自尊心的。自己的問題，必須自己來解決，我們非自己努力來克服當前的困難不可。如何去克服這種困難，就需要政府與人民共同努力合作；在政府方面有政府的責任，在人民方面也有人民的責任。</p>
<p>就政府的責任來說，在八抗戰破壞之餘，人民急須休養生息的時候，再來實行戡亂政策，本是不得已的辦法，就應該顧到國家的力量和人民的生活。在戡亂政策之下，政府應厲行緊縮政策，應該用特種方法去籌措收入。關於戰費的來源，應立即實行「建國特捐」，請富人拿出錢來。而政府對經常支出部分，也應該儘量節流，以做到收支絕對平衡的地步。</p>
<p>在政府實行上述改革中，人民也必須與政府合作，盡到人民應盡的責任。比如說，政府要舉辦「建國特捐」，有錢的人就應該看看一般人民生活痛苦的情形，而自動慷慨解囊，爲了國家也爲了自己，現在很多人都把資產逃到國外去，難道有了錢，眞的可以不要國家了嗎？這種行動，是會引起世界人士的輕視的。</p>
<p>其次是一般商人和投機家要負責任的。我們大家曉得，由於大家有錢就搶購物資，使貨幣流通速度大大增加，這是需要一般人民自動與政府合作的，如果人民不隨時搶購物資，則政府再多發點鈔票，物價也不會如此上漲了，要物價停止上漲，則一切問題的解決，就比較容易着手了。我國當前的經濟困難能否克服，就要看政府和人民能不能照上面所說的做去。</p>

<h3>朱紹良在昆明　發表出巡西南的觀感</h3>
<p>〔本報昆明廿七日航訊〕抗戰訪利以來，西南各省人民生活是比較安定的，然而「寫」的病源無法解決，因之，蔣主席特令重慶行轅朱主任紹良於巡視西南四省之便，並代表實慰人民，傳達中央愛護德意。</p>
<p>八月一日朱主任自渝啓節，那時朱將軍　疾剛剛痊愈，便僕農征途，而且決定沿途都乘坐汽車，辛苦可知。首先在成都，雅安，榮山，彼府各地巡視，然復於八月十五日自四川瀘州出發，沿途經敘永，畢節，威寗，宣　，沿川滬東路於十八日下午抵達　益。昆市各機關各人民團體，平已籌備熱烈歡迎，除省府方面遣派專人專車前往迎迓外，十九日中午東城古潼公園已是萬頭鑽動，靜候着元首代表的蒞臨。</p>
<p>下午兩點鐘零七分，一桸三星吉普車，在軍榮悠揚聲中，緩核駛入市區。朱將軍容光煥發，儀態莊重，首先由盧主席迎入古　公園小憇，那日冠盡雲集，盛極一時，是昆市自觀總司令蒞昆以來的又一次罕有盛會，大家的情緒都非常熱烈興營，朱將軍和盧主席，張監察使，鄧主委，何總司令，　議長等寒暄，談笑風生，毫無倦容，然後在一陣軍樂聲中，又逕赴金碧別舉行館休息。　記者華登上一輛小車，也尾隨着到了行館，候不多久，朱將軍</p>
<p>戎裝接見</p>
<p>記者，他說沿途雖比較辛苦，但比起西北來，可真優越的多，無論地理環塊，人文氣候，交通工具等等，都很令人滿意。此行目的，首在代表蔣主席宣慰四省人民，同時也視察西南一般軍政與治安，對動員戡亂機宜有所指示，西南各省在戰時貢獻甚大，自勝利還都以後，蔣主席時時都在懷念西南各省人民，且朱將軍自六月接篆視事以後，對四省軍政，經濟，交通，敎育，文化及邊防等，都確寳需要知道一點</p>
<p>富地情況</p>
<p>所以決定不辭勞苦，親自作一次長途的巡視。</p>
<p>四川省的地理環境和經濟條件都佔優勢，雲南雖然印象不深，可是人力物力充沛，滿有前途，至於貴州邊邊境一帶是過於貧苦，人民生活有待改善，朱將軍帶點福建口音，滔滔不絕地發表他的出巡觀感。說起西康治安問題，他很有把握地答覆記者。匪患無虞。中央的兵力，足够鎭壓。</p>
<p>一連幾天的會樽晚會，昆市京滇名角一起出動，盛况空前，召集軍隊機關長官訓話，檢閱駐軍二十六師，整日都在勞動，備極辛勤，二十三日應盧主席的邀約，赴溫泉小憇，並與各要員談話，指示要公。溫泉的「天下第一湯」對於朱主任的足疾大有裨益，據說幾日來的洗滌，足疾已完全痊可，</p>
<p>步屬甚健</p>
<p>不若在旅途中的阢隍不安。　爲了還要巡視貴州，爲了還要赴京參加四中全會，朱將軍雖對雲南甚多好感，但也不能不決定在二十八日離昆。他說：從南京回來後，很想再到昆明小住幾月，由此足徵朱主任對昆明有着極深極好的觀感。</p>
<p>貴州主席楊子惠氏已經派遣專員在盤縣迎迓朱將軍。因爲貴州人民也正等待着一國元首代表的蒞臨。（特派員徐繼　）</p>

<p>該公司紗布委託各公司代銷南洋各地，刻尙在試辦時期中，如試辦成績圓滿，以後進一步之計劃，擬仿照美孚，亞西亞，德士古各汽油公司在各地設立油棧方式，分在香港，新加坡，暹羅，馬尼刺等地，設置倉庫，常時堆置各地所需要之紗布，俾貨暢其流，調劑各地供需，俾各代銷公司資金，亦得以融通。同時將使該公司紗布在各地行銷之市價，保持合理而平穩之水準。該公司目前已訂立之代銷合同，包括香港，新加坡，暹羅三地。菲律賓之代銷合同，週內即可望訂立。已訂立之各合同中，香港與新加坡兩地，係委託中國國貨聯營公司代銷，合同早已於一個半月前訂立，兩地各已試銷紗布一批。暹羅合同，方於八月廿七日訂立。暹羅由該地組營紗布業之華僑商行八九十家所合資組成之華聯公司，出面簽訂代銷合同。第一批試銷貨，有棉紗五百件，各色棉布二萬疋，刻正候輪裝暹。非律賓方面之代銷合同，刻正談判中，本週內當有端倪。據比較：南洋各地紗布市價，目前以暹羅較好，且少外貨競爭，不失爲一良好之海外市塲云。</p>
<h3>公債司長陳炳章談　外幣債券償付問題　美金公債仍以外匯償還</h3>
<p>管理外匯辦法改訂後，卅六年美金短期庫券應否繼續發售，及如何償還，財政部以事關政府債信，且　及其他外幣債券，曾經通盤計議，擬具辦法，於二十日呈奉行政院核定。按照指定銀行掛牌美匯市價折償本息，並繼續發售短期庫券各節，已誌前報。日昨財部公債司司長陳炳章，因公來滬，記者昨日特往訪問詳情，據答如下：</p>
<p>（一）關於此案，本部已於卅日晚奉到院令，當即電達中央銀行查照轉飭遵辦，預料卅六年庫券，自本（一日）日起，可在各地恢復發售。</p>
<p>（二）院令所稱各種外幣債券，按照指定銀行市價折價一節，係指廿七廿九及卅一年所發外幣債券而言。至卅六年美金公債，前經國民政府特准以外匯償還，自仍應遵照辦理，並未改以國幣折付。此項公債，本年九月底到期之第一期本息基金，早經政府撥交基金監理委員會收存備付。</p>
<p>（三）三十八年短期庫券，計經售出二千七百四十餘萬美元，此部份應付利息共約九百六十餘萬美元，本年九月底爲償佬本息之第一期，其本息基金亦經撥交基金監理會保管。</p>
<p>（四）廿七年及廿九年金公債發行額，各爲英金一千萬鎊，美金五千萬元，但僅銷售一部份，其餘係抵押與國家銀行。其銷售部份，目下尙欠本息共約英金一百三四十萬餘鎊，美金二千五六百萬元，廿七年金公債規定十五年分三十期償淸，現已還八年，共十六期。二十九年金公債，規定二十五年分五十期償淸，現已還五年共十期。</p>
<p>（五）三十一年同盟勝利美金公債發行額一億美元，全部售出，規定十年分二十期償淸，現已還三年半共七期，目下尙欠本息共約美金九千七百二十餘萬元。至卅一年美金儲蓄券一億美元，目下到期特付本金，約一千九百萬美元。</p>
<p>（六）購買卅六年美金公債繳付貼息，應照指定銀行美匯市價折算，已由本部電達中央銀行査照辦理，其餘因照市價發售庫券，及償還債券所發生之技術問題，俟與國行洽商決定之。</p>
<p>（七）此次政府決定外幣債券按照指定銀行掛牌市價折付本息，對於國庫負担之增加，自屬難免。但當局仍毅然爲之，具見維護國家債信之至意。本部兪部長對此重要措施，曾經發表談話，本人恕不多贅。但望人民與政府切實合作，推行合理之財政政策，一面政府確立債信，一面人民認　債券．此後公債政策如能推行順利，不但對於减少通貨膨脹有所　益，抑且表示我民族自力更生之決心。</p>
<h3>菲律濱僑商　設聯營公司</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕菲律賓僑商中華，華東，華通，勝興，南通，興華，振東等七家，爲接洽經理紡建公司紗布銷菲事宜，曾派代表來滬，與紡建當局數度洽商。茲悉：該七家僑商，決聯合本市紗布出口商建華大茂等四家，合資創設一紗布銷菲聯營公司，資本額定美金一百萬元，總公司設馬尼刺，並擬在上海設立辦事處，本週內即將由該聯營公司出面，與紡建公司訂立紗布代銷菲島合同。聞第一次試銷貨品，預定各色棉布五萬疋，內以花色布及漂布佔大宗。聞紡建交貨時，即將由聯營公司先付貨款八成，並由銀行担保，其餘二成候紗布在菲銷售後結淸。同時紡建亦將派員駐菲，監視代銷情形云。</p>
<h3>中央銀行訂定　代紡外棉繳紗辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕開於輸入限額分配處第一二兩季外棉限額項下核配各紗廠之外棉，前經中央銀行與紡調會商定將此項棉花由政府收回，交由各獲得限額分配之紗廠代紡後繳紗，各廠因訂購外棉所墊付之外匯及其他費用，業由中央銀行加息直接收還，各廠應提供繳款等據向中行辦理登記。至第二季核配外棉，尙有未結匯而訂購部份，各廠可仍按照規定手續，持同有關證件，照例辦理申請，送由該行核轉中國花旗兩銀行洽辦，無須另繳國幣，俾减少返還結匯手續，以資簡捷。至此項外棉代紡工繳利潤及收紗付款等，業經中央銀行與紡調會商訂辦法如下：</p>

<h3>第四階級的福利何在</h3>
<p>— 森林</p>
<p>蕭伯納曾乾脆地說：「新聞學是文學的最高超形式；因爲所有最高尙的文學就是新聞學」。做一個新聞記者，就精神方面說，也够體面了。</p>
<p>二十世紀儘管有黄色新聞和資本主義報紙等名稱，而我國所謂第四階級（Fourth　Estate）——謙遜底說，就是在第三等的平民以下的一級——的新聞記者，仍舊說不了文人的淸苦典型。</p>
<p>除了少數大都市間優越的例外，目下全國的新聞記者也許和公敎人員一樣，多數還在半挨餓狀態中。所不同的，社會對於公敎人員雖則愛莫能助，多少總寄以同情，而新聞記者呢，有時候却爲一部份特殊勢力者所嫌惡。</p>
<p>我們常聽得同業中的前輩說，新聞記者固不能自視過低，以求保持相當地位；可是也不能自視過高，以免脫離現實。這話眞是顚撲不破，就新聞記者的本身來說，對於資本主義誰都不能否認不是僱傭關係；進一步來說，所謂新聞記者者，還不是一批寫作和編訪的智力勞働者麽？</p>
<p>日內瓦國際勞工處，從前曾經編日過一種「新聞記者工作與生活情况」的調査報吿，對於各國新聞記者的工作和生活情狀的資料，搜羅頗豐。內容方面，就勞働者的立塲來看，較重要的有，工作解僱，勞資糾紛。工作狀况中，包括工作時間，夜工作，星期休息，常年例假，和工資等。此外還有一章，對於每個新聞記者有切身關係的，就是吃飯問題的「勞働市塲」，調査失業與找尋職業等各種資料。</p>
<p>新聞記者聽起來是自由職業，其實這一行實際上是文化工人，在物質酬報方面，遠不及醫師……律師……等。醫師可以自訂診例，隨意收費，新聞記者能自訂潤例者，恐百不得一；醫師如聲明在前，深夜可以謝絕出診，新聞記者之從事編輯工作者，每天神經緊張地深夜做到天亮，反而視爲當然。</p>
<p>新聞記者常對人說，我們要站在時代之前領導社會，何以對本身的健康保障，職業保障，以及一切福利事業，還沒有具體而充實的計劃呢！在科學發達的今日，何以報紙從業員的生活情狀，還和五十年前一樣呢？</p>
<p>今天「九一」記者節，我們能否把這個問題，作爲今後研究的課題之一呢？</p>
<h3>「新聞記者年會」倡議</h3>
<p>— 儲裕生</p>
<p>新聞學旣是一種專門的學術，新聞記者應該是這一學術的實踐者和研究者，他的地位，在學術的價値上相同於工程師，地質學專家，水利專家的。中國自有新聞紙以來，一般人都對新聞記者有一誤解，即是只要粗通文墨，就可以充當新聞記者，因此，新聞學術至今還沒有多大的進步。記得在抗戰時期，陪都曾有新聞學會的組織，會內理監事，都是全國新聞事業的領袖，他們日理萬機，所以也沒有長足的表現。我個人，或許是代表一般的新聞記者有這樣的一個希望，就是希望能够有新聞記者年會的組織，在這年會上，將新聞記者平素研究的心得買諸於大衆，將實踐的工作，報吿於大衆，再將關於新聞學的論文朗誦給大衆聽。要參加這個年會的，必須要對新聞事業有相當的貢獻，必須要提供實際具體的例證，或是對新聞學有硏究者，或是受過專門的新聞學術敎育，或是受過高等敎育後在新聞事業的崗位上工作過二三年。</p>
<p>有人會這樣問：「新聞記者終平繁忙，那裏有暇空來參加這個年會」？我說，我們可以推舉代表，帶自己的研究心得，工作報告，學術論文到會上去讀。同時，一個身爲新聞記者的人，他的足跡應該跑遍天下，正可趁這機會到舉行年會的所在地去觀光一番。</p>
<p>學術沒有階級，新聞記者如果對新聞學有興趣的話，如果想使新聞學推展前進的話，這新聞記者年會實有舉行的必要。</p>
<h3>省記者年會</h3>
<p>— 陸壚</p>
<p>爲了團結新聞記者自身，江蘇省的新聞記者公會揀着一個春天在　江成立了。春天是個美麗的季節，也是個有着陽光普照的日子。它象徵未來的光芒和熱力。在這個偉大的成立會裏決定了在「九一」記者節在無鍋舉行首屆年會；首屆記者年會舉行的地點選在無錫，這是我們的光榮．也是全無錫人的光榮。</p>
<p>這次來無錫的各縣新聞記者的會員代表，預計是六十人，我們以一種討人情的作風在無錫新闢的第一流的旅社——中國飯店定下了四十個房間。然而，緊張的消息從上海方面傳來，上海的同業們爲了競選立委和國代，打着鮮明的旗幟要「適逢其盛」呢。我們又不得不替他們留一個較於接近代表們的舒適的宿處。然而，至今還沒有曉得上海究竟來多少人，也無從接洽起。我們盼望上海的朋友取得聯繁。（通訊處無鍋前西溪十六號籌備處總幹事沙仲虎）</p>
<p>在「九一」記者節晚上，將有盛大的月光園遊會，地點在蠡圓，聚餐便在該國的大草坪上。理想中：有熾烈塲面的派對，也有恬靜茶座的彈詞，十點半以後，泛湖暢敍。湖上有巡廻音樂演奏，因爲適宜於月下的情調，故用的是中樂的管絃。唱的是崑曲。閙的是在遠處佈置着的鑼鼓，雖然有急急風，將軍令；但是在遠處，不會使得在船上的佳賓們有點煩躁的感覺。閉着眼睛想想：這是多麼令人神往的境地呵？湖面上的月光，隱約湖邊的靑山，幾個知己在船中聊天，這又是多麽可愛的鏡頭呵！</p>
<h3>記者節偶感</h3>
<p>— 黃寄萍</p>
<p>勝利後慶祝記者節，今天還是第二次，這給予我同業精神上的安　與鼓勵，確是相當深刻。我們當記者的人，所負使命，本屬重大，所謂發揚文化，爲民喉舌，人家還尊稱一聲「無冕帝皇」，其實能盡力做到的有百分之幾？我們自己也不敢說</p>
<p>幹了二十年記者生活，今年望得明年好，明年還是活不了！想起某元老說的「中國的事，永遠一國糟」，這話眞不錯。</p>
<p>廻想八年抗戰，艱苦奮鬥，我們爲了堅守國策，而反抗「和運」，抨擊「敵偽」，終於被汪逆通緝，因此深居簡出，力避醜類鋒鏑，失却自由，想當年艱苦鬥，，至今猶有餘痛！</p>
<p>現實如此，誰也不能灰心喪志，在職一日，盡職一日；大家要鼓起自信，立定決心，促進復興事業，協力建國工作，個人方面，希望盡力策勉，勤於研究，積極精進。</p>
<h3>收集步光</h3>
<p>— 合生</p>
<p>桂步光—是代表着千百萬記者羣中的一個典型的塑像；抗戰以前，他在上海工作，抗戰以後他輾轉戰地，生活至爲艱難。</p>
<p>當我得到他消息的時候，他在湖南邵陽某報工作。湘桂戰事發生，他流離顫沛地隨着難民羣抵達陪都重慶。</p>
<p>他在邵陽的時候，我們經常通蒲信，他在那裏工作很努力，但精神不很好，有人說他爲了戀愛，神經有些失常；後來又遭遇了大火，把他行李燒個精光，那時他情緒之惡劣，是可以想見的。</p>
<p>他到重慶，我還是在難民的名單中看到的。當時，我還在贛南，對他飽嘗戰時流離的痛苦，我具有着十二分的關切與同感。因爲戰地的離亂，我是曾經身受的。</p>
<p>過了不久，我知道他已加入重慶某報工作，我爲他慶幸，他可以從此安定地住下來，爲他多年孱弱的身體，好好地喘一口氣。</p>
<p>但是，這一喘息的時間，是多麽短促。過了不多久，、我就得到他病歿重慶的噩耗！</p>
<p>步光和一切新聞記者一樣，具有追求眞理的最高的情操。他喜愛眞，也喜歡美；他厭惡僞善，他扶持正義。</p>
<p>他平日讀書甚多，對於是非黑白，他更偏執不苟。</p>
<p>但是，現實與玄想是隔得多麽遼遠而矇朧；步光輾轉數萬里，終致在貧病中站在新聞崗位上，沒沒無聞地死去了。他的死，對於我們不是頽喪，而是一種鼓勵的力量！</p>
<p>歷史是永遠向前看的，步光雖在泉下，也一定指着我們邁進的方向！</p>
<h3>科學救窮</h3>
<p>— 陳正予</p>
<p>方今中國社會，充滿不逞不怡之氣－好的變壞，壞的變得更壞，提起世道人心，令人　嗟太息！數千年來長期停滯於專制封建的政治所遺留下的歷史渣滓滲透了我們今日的思想，生活，制度，使我們一切脫離生產本位，於是，我們顯得貧乏而無無力。</p>
<p>提倡科學，發揚文化，走向生產，利用厚生，賴此以建國，賴此以轉移浮囂的今日社會風氣，我報人應以此引爲天職。揮其一枝禿筆，灌輸人民科學生產之智識與觀念。</p>
<h3>獨白</h3>
<p>— 廷</p>
<p>欣逢自己的節目，我願意提出我們（內勤記者）的健康問題，因爲不健康的苦痛，我們無數同業都已受够了！從事業的立塲說，我們是犧牲小我爲大衆，從職業的立塲說，我們却都是出賣健康之流，我們幹的是第三百六十一行。</p>
<p>這一行人，（晚上不睡覺的人），十九患着一種極嚴重的慢性病－神經系統的日趨崩潰。但是久而久之，他們似乎也漸漸習慣了，對於自己的面黄肌瘦竟不自憐惜，反而善於解嘲自慰，說「過慣了也無所謂」。這，太可憐了！</p>
<p>今天，我沒有充沛的精力來慶祝佳節，只切望還我健康，例如：各電訊社的晚稿能夠提早截稿，各報社能實行輪流休息制以及多注意夜工作人員的健身設備與活動等，那是功德無量的！</p>
<h3>徒有虛名的「無冕帝王」</h3>
<p>— 佐溪</p>
<p>沒有做記者的時候，羡慕「無冕帝王」的「尊榮威風」，做了記者以後，却又天天怨恨自己生活的困苦顚沛。</p>
<p>我有一位朋友從事新聞事業已有卅多年歷史，可是至今只留得一頭白髮，兩袖淸風！今日，多少新聞從業員猶喘息在生活担子的重壓下！</p>
<p>你想：「白　奔波，漏夜昏燈，從年初一忙到年卅夜」，睡眠常不足六小時而又患着營養不良症的記者生活，不要說「無免帝王」徒有虛名，就連最淸苦的敎師恐怕也比不上吧（當然不是一槪而論的）。前幾天，就在敎師節的次日，據說曾經演出敎記集團自殺的慘劇；我們固然不希望在記者節會有同樣的悲劇演出，但是誰又能保設永遠不會有這類事情發生呢？</p>
<p>記者節，對於我們該是個最値得紀念的令節；可是每年此日寫幾篇紀念文章，開一次慶祝大會，似乎也覺得太無聊，太沒意思吧。如果「無冕帝王」們能於每年此日，做一些替自身謀福利，替後一代樹立百年大計的事情出來，不更有意義嗎？</p>
<p>希望「無冕帝王」會有「瓦爿翻身」的一天，至少不再是社會被壓迫羣中的一份子！</p>

<h3>自己的話</h3>
<p>記者據說是無冕之王，不知這這是誰上的封號，想來大槪還是太平時代的古語。而今時過境遷，早已不足爲據、　爲讀書人的記者，當然屬於士農工商的士，事實上平因時勢不同，降居末流以外了。</p>
<p>尤共我們　副刊的，位列偏房，更是無話可說。</p>
<p>常聽到一支流行歌曲，中間有一句話，是「夜生活都爲了衣食住行。」聽起來總不免有些刺耳和聯想，而常夜深人靜，昏燈之下，與刀剪漿糊爲伴，人生意味亦就可想而知。</p>
<p>然而當我們每晚接到許多作家的文稿和讀者的書信，又常使我們感到許多無形的慰藉，也是事實。</p>
<p>人生不能單單爲了衣食住行，而爲衣食住行可幹的玩意兒還多着。大概也就是屈大夫所說的：「余固知賽賽之爲患兮，忍而不能舍也。」所以我們在「寗正言不諱，以危身乎？將從俗富貴，以媮生乎？」之間，終於選擇了前者。當然不外這個原故。</p>
<p>依理說，時代的混亂是變態，世運的倒轉是畸形；總有一天，天下太平，是非分明的日子，眞理還是眞理。至於我們編副刊的朋友在這時代還能保持着這一塊乾凈園地，供給讀者一點乾淨的精神食糧，勉強間心無愧；那麼這也就是我們息慰自勉之道了。</p>
<p>恭逢記者令節，不能無言，因草綴數語，也算是自己的話吧，藉向作家與讀者敬致感謝之忱。（編者）</p>
<h3>悼念弘一上人</h3>
<p>— 匡瀛</p>
<p>——逝世六週年紀念</p>
<p>弘一上人圓寂到現在已六個年頭了，寳筏南歸，衆生失依。想到近年來我國藝術界的空虛，和文學界的動　不安，更便人想起這位文壇的巨匠了。</p>
<p>吳稚　曾說過一句話：一李叔同可以做一個藝術家而不做，倔去當和尙。」有許多人對吳老這句話是有同感的：知道弘一身世的人，都以爲這位對國畫，金石，音樂，文學，戲劇都有着濃厚興趣和硏究的人，曾辦過報紙，曾從事革命工作，曾是一位風流倜　的濁世佳公子，却在中年之後，竟消極得會投入空門，在一般人看來這是一個謎。</p>
<p>其實，要硏究和理解弘一的思想和生活並不是容易的事。一個人當嚐過最濃厚而複雜的生活之後，却想歸之於平淡。本來；藝術是反映人生，表現人生，評判人生的武器，所以藝術的目的是積極的。弘一是對藝術有高深硏究的人，他所以甘願放棄他的藝術生活，向　關貝葉中對枯寂生活者，因他所處的時代，是一個紛紜錯雜的社會，向外看是社會動　，向裏看是家園　衰落，他的加人同盟曾從事革命，是憂國憤時的一種熱情表現；以後之悄然出塵由革命者轉入僧侶生活，乃是時間冲淡了他的熱情，參澈於佛經中之「衆生無常」「色相皆空」之悟境。</p>
<p>弘一在年輕時，走馬章台，　有一妻兩妾，戀過名妓，摔過坤角，交好於歌郞，可謂風流憶極，但以後在杭州靈　寺剃度，妻女欲求一面尙不能，這是什麽緣故呢？大几一個人極端的享樂，往往是極　枯寂的前奏，濃極思淡，樂極生悲。可說是人之常情，在這個時候，每個人都有着悟澈的機伏，不過常人未能瞭然於人生之虛空，聰明者多能自拔於急管繁弦之中，弘一有着高深的藝術修養十，理解人生愈深自然悟解人生亦深。</p>
<p>到今天，距離上人在福建漳州圓寂已足足六個年頭了。在晚年，上人頗愛閩南的氣候，謂將終老此邦。先是，上人有南洋之行，因爲戰爭，不果行，當時會致書友好間，表示當時對付敵難，願意捨身殉敎。茲錄一書：「健魂居士文席，惠　欣悉一一，諸荷護念，感謝無盡。　因傳貫師勸，往菲延期，遂免於難，否則囚居古浪矣。但對付敵難，捨身殉敎，朽人於四年前已有決心，曾與傳貫師等言及。古詩云：「莫嫌老圃秋容淡，猶有黄花晚節香」。吾人一生之中，晚節最爲要緊，願與同仁等共勉之也」。</p>
<p>從這書中我們可以看到上人處世之堅貞，與產年時風流倜儻的性情完全不同。上人少年時的一切，完全是「玩世」的行爲，如不繫之舟，無拘無束。出家後的上人，却完全是以「救世」爲懷，所以雖然是寫字作畫之事，恐也會妨碍他的道行而擱筆不寫。我們揣測上人主觀的意識，少年時以一個救國救民的革命家身份，決邊於社會之中；和晚年時以「我不入地獄誰入地獄」的心情普救衆生，同樣是悲天憫人，捨身救人，在思想的本質上是沒有區別的。上人出家時，自二祗携一鞋一做，但所抱宏願，　要救盡苦難，故當時病劇時，２說：「吾生西後，乘　再來，一切度生事業，都可圓成」。同時，在病境十分沉重時，尙　書「悲欣交集」四個大字，此可見上人法願之宏與自待之嚴，到臨死時的一悲一喜。悲人世之沉淪如故，喜自己解脫之日，若非高僧，若無宏賜，焉克此、</p>
<p>上人於三十一年九月一日在閩南圓寂，世變如昔，今上人　木已拱，懷念這位多才多藝的上人，頓覺有寳筏西去衆生失依之感。</p>

<p>編輯先生，我是一個廿五歲的女子，受過高　敎育。我的父親是一家銀行的經理，我的母親是一個典型的「大家閨秀」。父母只生我一人，從小嬌生慣養，總算是一個幸顧的人兒了。但是不幸的事終於到來。當我在大　裏的時候，我認識了一個男同學。他的品性，學識，和人格，都配合我理想中的伴侶的條件。我們漸漸的由友誼而進入戀愛。</p>

<h3>Guling's Scenery Eagerly Awaited by Citizens: Chairman and Madame Chiang Arrive Together, Scheduled for a Brief Ten-Day Respite Before Returning to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 31st] Chairman Chiang, accompanied by his wife, departed Nanjing by special plane at 11:50 AM on the 31st for a brief stay in Guling. Yu Jishi, Cao Shengfen, and others accompanied them. Two attendant aircraft had taken off an hour earlier. Few knew of the Chairman's departure beforehand, and those seeing him off at the aircraft were few. Rumors of Chairman Chiang's trip to Guling had circulated for some time. The Guling summer residence had long been cleaned and prepared, but the Chairman, due to the heavy workload in the capital, was unable to make the trip earlier. Currently, with official duties temporarily lighter, he is going to Guling with his wife to enjoy the refreshing nature of the springs and forests, and to take a brief rest. The stay in Guling is not expected to exceed ten days, as the "Double Ninth Festival" is approaching, and a joint conference of the Party and the Youth League will be presided over by the Chairman.</p>
<p>[Our Nanchang Correspondent, 31st] Chairman Chiang and his wife flew to Nanchang on the afternoon of the 31st and then transferred to Guling, arriving at 2:00 PM. Wang Lingji went to Xun on the morning of the 31st to respectfully greet them.</p>
<p>[Our Guling Correspondent, 31st] Chairman Chiang and his wife arrived at the Shili Pu airport in Xun by special plane at 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 31st. The news of the Chairman's arrival was extremely sudden, and people from all walks of life in Guling were unable to rush to the airport to welcome them, only waiting at Lotus Cave. Those present included Director Wu of the Ying Shan Management Bureau, Director Zhang of the Lu Shan Police Bureau, Deputy Commander Du of the Military Police Regiment, and others. After disembarking, the Chairman drove to Lotus Cave, then was carried by sedan chair up the mountain, proceeding along the winding mountain path. The Madame occasionally looked back and inquired of Director Wu about the general situation of Guling. She was particularly concerned about the aftermath of the fire this spring. At 2:50 PM, they arrived at the streets of Guling, where nine thousand citizens gathered excitedly on the streets, some even going to Small Heavenly Pool to welcome them, forming lines and applauding. The Chairman frequently nodded, appearing very pleased. They then went to the Chairman's summer residence at No. 12, Hedong Road, to rest. The Chairman was wearing a yellowish-brown woolen military uniform, and the Madame was in native dress, wearing a large straw hat, looking as elegant as ever. In the afternoon, they strolled on the lawn of the residence. In the evening, they went to Songshu Road to view the Lu Shan moonlight. The weather in the mountains was good today, with no rain, typical of the mid-autumn climate. In the evening, the mountain breeze and pine whispers were especially refreshing. The Chairman changed into a Zhongshan suit, and the Madame added a red wool sweater. They strolled and admired the moon for a long time, returning at 8:00 PM, having enjoyed themselves thoroughly. Furthermore, the Lu Shan Daily is scheduled to publish a special edition tomorrow to welcome the Chairman and Madame's arrival, consisting of a four-page spread. The newspaper's president, Yu Tianwen, and others were working overnight to compile the articles, very busy.</p>
<p>"Central News Agency, Guling, 31st" Chairman Chiang and his wife arrived here at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 31st. After disembarking, the Chairman and Madame immediately boarded a car to Lotus Cave and then ascended the mountain by sedan chair. The Madame's sedan chair preceded the Chairman's. They paused briefly at Jiashan Bing. The Chairman jokingly asked a girl, "How old are you this year?" The girl initially replied eight years old, and then said ten years old. The Chairman alighted from the sedan chair and walked a few dozen steps. The Madame said, "Don't walk, you'll have plenty of walking to do up the mountain later." They then rested again at Guizhu Forest. When the sedan chair passed Tianchi Kou, the Chairman praised the scenery there, turning to his entourage and saying, "This place is very refreshing." Proceeding further, they reached the street entrance of the Guling city area, where the people lined the streets, applauding to welcome them, for they had long awaited the arrival of their head of state. The Chairman frequently nodded, smiling, and said, "Good, good, thank you all!"</p>

<h3>Flour Distributed to Troops of Inferior Quality and Unfit for Consumption: Hebei Provincial Assembly Requests Government Investigation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] The Control Yuan recently received a report from the Hebei Provincial Assembly stating that over 90,000 bags of general-purpose flour, recently shipped to Ping (Beiping) by the Shanghai Fuxin Flour Mill for military use, were of poor quality and unfit for consumption. After being distributed to various units, the soldiers complained. It was difficult for the various units and the General Directorate of Military Stations to handle the situation. After investigation, it was confirmed to be true. This not only harms the health of the soldiers but also affects military morale, which is of great concern. Therefore, at the sixth meeting of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Assembly, a resolution was passed to request the Central Military Comfort Mission to forward the matter to the government for investigation. The Control Yuan believes that this matter is of great importance. In addition to immediately dispatching senior officials to thoroughly investigate, they also expressed the hope that if members of the public have any information about the perpetrators of this corruption and their actions, they should promptly report or secretly inform the Control Yuan so that legal action can be taken.</p>

<h3>The Min and Qing Parties Will Submit Lists of Candidates for Universal Suffrage; The National Congress of the Youth Party Opens This Morning</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Zhang Junli, Chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, flew from Anshan to Shanghai at 6:00 PM last night. Xu Chuanlin, Dai Yiqiao, Jiang Yuntian, Cui Xinyi and others also arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing.

<p>[Another Report] The 11th National Congress of the Youth Party is scheduled to open at 9:00 AM this morning at the Lido Garden on Taixing Road.

<h3>All Kinds of Vocational Groups such as Industry and Commerce Will Adjust the Number of Seats in Universal Suffrage</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] According to a business leader who returned to Shanghai from Nanjing: "In the future universal suffrage, the number of representatives among the industrial, commercial, agricultural, and fishery industries will be adjusted to make them more balanced. It is expected that after the adjustment, the number of seats for commercial groups in the Legislative Yuan may increase by five, and the number of seats for National Assembly representatives will also be increased." Regarding the imposition of the Special Construction Contribution, the person believes that the starting point of 5 billion is very reasonable. Because the object of the Construction Contribution is the wealthy, and assets below 5 billion have already been subject to income tax. However, the implementation of the Construction Contribution is quite difficult because China has not conducted property registration in the past. How to implement it properly remains to be carefully planned by the competent authorities.</p>

Most of the main force of the communist bandits is currently concentrated at the Haihekou and Hailong areas. There are also frequent deployments in the Rehe area. The National Army has deployed carefully on all fronts, and the bandits' attempts will surely fail." Zheng flew to Siping on the morning of the 30th to inspect and returned to Shenyang that night.</p>

<h3>The Yalta Secret Agreement Allowed the Soviet Union to Control the Northeast; American Newspapers Criticize Washington's Policy Errors</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] London 31st Broadcasting: George, the former chairman of the US Senate Finance Committee, delivered a radio address to leaders of countries around the world, saying: "It is almost impossible for us to expect cooperation from the Soviet Union. The division of Germany and the Soviet Union's control of Northeast China, North China, and Korea are now a fait accompli. The conclusion of the European and Axis peace treaties cannot be delayed too long, and it must be completed as soon as possible regardless of the Soviet Union's views." George believes that the Soviet Union neither needs war nor is prepared to fight, but is only waiting for an opportunity. It is said that George's views on foreign policy often coincide with those of the White House, so his remarks are worthy of attention.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 30th] An editorial in the neutral Chicago Daily News recently pointed out that the 1945 Yalta Agreement has made the situation in China more chaotic today, so it must be considered one of the biggest diplomatic mistakes in American history. The clauses in the agreement regarding the Northeast actually allowed the Soviet Union to control North Korea. The newspaper said that Roosevelt then agreed to make China accept these clauses, and the Soviet Union obtained what it wanted from them. Only after the war was won did the Soviet Union participate in the war against Japan for about a week, "China lost the Northeast," and only received empty guarantees of assistance from the United States.</p>
<h3>Presidents of Universities in Shanghai Cable US Authorities Expressing Their Views on Special Envoy Wedemeyer's Statement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Yesterday, the presidents of various universities in Shanghai jointly cabled US President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, Senate Speaker Vandenberg, Democratic Senator Barkley, House Speaker Martin, and House Democratic Leader Rayburn, expressing their views on the statement made by the Wedemeyer Investigation Mission upon leaving China. The full text of the translated cable is as follows:</p>
<p>The people of our country welcomed the Wedemeyer Investigation Mission to China with great hope, believing that the mission would conduct a practical investigation of the current situation in our country in order to find practical and feasible ways to assist China, because what the general suffering civilians of our country are encountering today is a matter of fact, not a matter of theory.</p>
<p>We, in our capacity as academics and educators, must state that the problem of our country is, in essence, the problem encountered when a long-standing culture suddenly enters the atomic age. The modern situation that Western countries have achieved after centuries may not be understood by outsiders if our country wants to match them all at once.</p>
<p>The Losses Suffered in the Anti-Japanese War Are the Reason for the Deterioration of the Situation</p>
<p>At the beginning of the mission's arrival, it asked government officials the following question: "China made the greatest progress in modern history from 1931 to 1937, but the situation has deteriorated since then. What are the reasons?" This question is extremely important, because the responsible officials in the government in the past few years have all been the responsible officials in the government from 1931 to 1937.</p>
<p>So, what are the reasons for the deterioration of the situation? China had been fighting Japan alone for four and a half years before the Pearl Harbor Incident, and in this eight-year war of resistance, almost all of the country's railways and resource-rich areas fell. This cruel war has led to the universal suffering of material and spiritual deterioration, which is probably unavoidable for any country in the same situation. Moreover, other countries in the United Nations ended their war in 1945, but China is still trapped in war and has not yet been able to rest. Due to the continued expenditure of large amounts of military expenses and the destruction of production capacity, rapid currency inflation is expected. However, are we forced to fight Japan first, and now our country has become a battleground for conflicting world ideologies? Did we bring all of this upon ourselves?</p>
<p>Before Peace and Order Are Restored, It Is Almost Impossible to Seek Improvement</p>
<p>Wei’s departure statement stated that “if the Chinese Communists are sincere, patriotic, and concerned about the welfare of their country, they should voluntarily abandon their efforts to achieve their ideology by force." We dare not have this illusion today. Wei continued: "In order to regain and preserve the faith of the Chinese people, the central government should immediately re-implement strict and far-reaching political and economic reforms." Our government and people should make their best efforts to curb and reverse the tide of deterioration, but we must still frankly admit that there is no possibility of fundamental improvement in the situation until domestic peace and order have been restored. We believe that it is extravagant to seek a solution to our country's difficulties by relying solely on the above recommendations.</p>
<p>People Hope for US Assistance, But It Must Not Harm Dignity and Sovereignty</p>
<p>The traditional friendship between our country and the United States has lasted for a hundred years, and the trust and admiration of the people of our country for the United States is sincere. The reason for this is that the American people have always treated us with impartiality in the past. No matter what significant differences there are between the two countries, they must make every effort to understand our country, and have never thought that only the traditions, habits, customs, and ways of thinking of the American people are divinely ordained.</p>
<p>The people of our country are in serious trouble. They are well aware of their own shortcomings. They hope for American cooperation, and they welcome American assistance to extricate themselves from their current predicament. However, for the sake of the long-standing traditional friendship between China and the United States, if there is such assistance, its conditions must not harm the dignity and sovereignty of the patriotic people of China.

<h3>National Army in Southern Henan Enters Guangshan; Air Force from Hankou Base Deployed to Assist in Battle; Remnants of Liu's Bandits Flee Towards Xuanhuadian</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, 31st] The siege of Zhengyang in Southern Henan has been lifted. This afternoon, the National Army capitalized on its victory and entered Guangshan. The National Army from Gushi Yejiaji is pressing towards Shangcheng at full speed. The remaining forces of Liu's bandits, consisting of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th, and Independent Brigades, now number less than 20,000. In recent days, Liu's bandits have been lingering in the Guangshan, Shangcheng, and both banks of the Zhugan River areas. This is because Liu's bandits deeply feel the suffering of facing a desperate situation. If they flee en masse into the Dabie Mountain area, the food shortage would be a minor concern, but the lack of ammunition would be fatal. If they flee to the Tongbai Mountains, they could coordinate with the bandits in Western Henan, but crossing the Pinghan Railway to the west would risk the annihilation of the entire army. Liu's bandits will have to choose one of these two options, and Liu's bandits may make a new move within days.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hankou, 31st] The 1st and 7th Columns of the Communist bandit Liu Bocheng's forces have been defeated by the National Army and reorganized into an independent column, commanding three brigades. On the evening of the 29th, after being tracked and attacked by the National Army, many bandits were killed. The remaining forces are fleeing towards Xuanhuadian. The National Army is in pursuit. Furthermore, a portion of the bandit Independent Brigade east of the road suffered a severe blow at Zhutangdian and has fled in disarray, seemingly returning to its original formation.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Bengbu, 31st] The main force of the 3rd Column of bandits, which suffered a disastrous annihilation in Shangcheng, is fleeing southwest and retreated through Fujing. Shangcheng was then recaptured. The bandit suppression troops are pursuing towards Jingfu. The 2nd, 3rd, and 6th Columns of bandits have retreated into the Dabie Mountains between Henan and Hubei. The center of gravity of the war in Southern Henan has shifted to the foot of the Dabie Mountains. Once blockaded, Liu Bocheng will repeat the fate of Li Xiannian's annihilation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 30th] More than 3,000 Communist bandits besieged Yiyang on the 30th. As of 5:00 PM on the 31st, the situation there is unclear.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yuanyang, 31st] The Baotuan Hengshui bandit army has been attacking fiercely for days, digging tunnels and launching repeated assaults. On the afternoon of the 29th, they once broke into the town, but over 400 were stabbed to death by the National Army, and they fled in disarray.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 31st] The air force at this base is deployed daily to assist ground troops in combat, in order to impede the southward advance of the Liu Bocheng bandit forces. The results achieved are very significant.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kaifeng, 30th] The Communist bandits who crossed the Yellow River from Western Henan to commit offenses are becoming increasingly rampant. The two counties of Xin'an and Mianchi have completely fallen. The bandits who infiltrated Dingyang captured Cun Duan Village yesterday and crossed the Luo River at 8:00 PM that night, surrounding the outskirts of Dingyang City. The local militia, led by Xu Jisheng, is engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits. The National Army in Luoyang launched an attack on the bandits at Hengshui on the morning of the 30th and engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits in the Weizhuang area, 20 li north of Luoyang. It is reported that a brigade commander was killed and many weapons were seized. The bandit headquarters is currently located in Wengong, about 50 li northwest of Luoyang, and has two brigades of troops. Based on the above situation, it has been determined that their crossing of the river this time is indeed intended to establish a new base, as they have claimed. The elders of Western Henan eagerly hope that the main force will advance westward and eliminate the bandit atmosphere.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, 31st] The National Army in Western Shandong frequently reports victories in sweeping operations. The remaining forces of the 1st, 3rd, and 8th Columns of the Communist East China Field Army and the Independent Brigade, totaling over 10,000, fled to Rangujiji west of Chengwu and the Qinggujiji, Wangdian, and Tianqiao areas southwest of Ningxian on the 29th. The National Army encircled and suppressed them in multiple routes. After fierce fighting until the evening of the 30th, over 3,000 remaining Communists were killed, and over 500 rifles were captured. Another route of the National Army encircled and annihilated the remaining bandits northwest of Chengwu. In three days, over 4,000 bandits were annihilated, over 1,000 rifles, over 50 heavy machine guns, and over 400 bandits were captured.</p>

<h3>Our Dismantling of Japanese Reparations Material; Principles for Receiving and Transporting Determined; Two Committees Established to Closely Coordinate and Handle</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 31st] The Reparations Committee of the Executive Yuan, in order to actively prepare for the dismantling of Japanese reparations material, previously consulted with relevant ministries and departments and drafted principles for receiving and transporting Japanese reparations material. These principles have been approved by the Executive Yuan and promulgated for implementation. The principles are as follows: (1) Regarding the selection, supervision, dismantling, and receipt of Japanese reparations and returned materials, a Receiving Committee shall be established, subordinate to the Resident Mission in Japan, supervised by the Reparations Committee, and shall follow the plans and programs established by the Reparations Committee. All staff members shall be assigned by relevant agencies based on the type and quantity of materials to be dismantled. The total number of personnel assigned is currently set at 222, to be adjusted at any time based on actual needs. (2) Regarding the supervision, coordination, priority procedures, and proposal of transport costs for materials, a Transport Supervision Committee shall be established by the Reparations Committee to handle these matters in a comprehensive manner. (3) Regarding the dismantling, receiving, and transport supervision of materials, the Receiving Committee and the Transport Supervision Committee shall maintain close contact and consult on these matters at all times. (4) The Ministry of Communications shall be responsible for the sea transport of materials from Japanese ports to the side of the ship at Chinese ports, in accordance with the approved regulations of the Transport Supervision Committee. (5) If there are heavy machinery exceeding the lifting capacity of the ship's equipment, the Ministry of Communications may deploy floating crane equipment from various port facilities to handle the lifting. (6) After the materials are delivered to the side of the ship at the port, the storage and warehousing shall be handled by the receiving agencies using their own facilities as much as possible. Agencies without their own docks and warehousing facilities shall have the Ministry of Communications handle these matters on their behalf, charging the prescribed fees. If the Ministry of Communications' warehousing facilities are insufficient, the Ministry of Communications shall make full use of the surplus capacity of the agencies' own warehouses, charging the appropriate fees. (7) The transport of materials from Chinese ports or warehouses shall be arranged directly with the transport agencies by the recipients of the materials. (8) The Ministry of Communications may establish temporary agencies domestically to handle the transport of materials in accordance with the plans and priority procedures established by the Transport Supervision Committee.</p>
<h3>Anshan Iron and Steel Works Embarks on the Road to Revival; Work Proceeding Intensively Amidst Enveloping Smoke</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Anshan, 31st] The Anshan Iron and Steel Works, which had been destroyed twice, has now embarked on the road to revival. Since August 6th, it has begun to produce 200 tons of steel per day. The 400-ton ironmaking furnace can also begin its ironmaking work by the end of September. With the iron and steel works as the parent body, more than 30 large-scale subsidiary factories, such as casting and steel pipe factories, have successively resumed work. The development of all of China's heavy industry will also take a giant step forward with the revival of Anshan. The reporter recently accompanied Sun Yueqi, Deputy Director of the Resources Committee, to inspect the factory. Inside the factory, the sound of machines operating was deafening, and the flames in the steelmaking furnaces were dazzling. In particular, the steel bars rolled by the various rolling mills were like countless fiery snakes dancing wildly across the ground, which was a remarkable sight inside the factory. The ingenious coordination of various machines, the skilled techniques of the workers, and the speed with which products were manufactured made people believe that a strong country must rely on industry. When the reporter arrived in Anshan from Shenyang, he saw countless chimneys piercing the sky, and large and small factories stretched for dozens of miles. No wonder the enemy and puppet regimes often praised it as the "Iron Capital." This Anshan, which had been quiet and deserted for many days, has finally been restored to its smoky state in the hands of the Taiwanese. Currently, the departments of the iron and steel works that have started work include more than 30 manufacturing factories for coking, steelmaking, rolling steel, casting steel, steel pipes, iron towers, wire ropes, rails, steel wheels, and bridges. By the end of September, after the ironmaking furnace is ignited, the entire continuous operation of the past steel works can be completed. According to a certain general manager, next year, it can produce 80,000 tons of steel and 120,000 tons of iron. In the following year, it can produce 420,000 tons of iron and steel. Five years later, it can produce one million tons per year. However, the completion of this plan must rely on two conditions: stability and funding. Over the past two days, the reporter has traveled throughout the various factories in Anshan and seen that most of the Japanese technicians and workers have been sent back to their countries. Currently, all machines are operated entirely by Chinese people, and the working morale is excellent. When asked about their working conditions, most of them said, "When the Japanese were here, they wouldn't let us do this, at most they would only let us be coolies for them." Although Anshan's steel production is not unique in the world, the production of various other factories in coordination in one place is still the first in the world. Anshan's iron and steel and Fushun's coal mines constitute the main conditions for "Industrial Northeast."</p>

<h3>Yu Dawei Discusses Improving Postal and Telecommunications Services</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 31st] Minister of Communications Yu Dawei told reporters today that the top priority for the transportation sector is to improve postal and telecommunications services to ensure rapid delivery.

However, because the Hankou airport is not suitable, it must be transferred to Shanghai. The reconstruction of the Longhua Airport in Shanghai is needed for national defense, and for the delivery of mail. Yu stated that air transport prioritizes mail first, passengers second, and cargo third. He also expressed his willingness to cooperate with the press to promote the development of culture.</p>

<h3>On the Red Stage in Warsaw, Figures Are Jumping; Fourth Letter from Poland</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>If we say that the Communist Parties all over the world use the same method to seize their political power, then another question that interests me in Warsaw should be: Who exactly is the Stalin of Poland? The Tito of Poland?</p>
<p>President Bierut is the number one veteran Communist in Poland, but Bierut does not have "power." People in the Polish government say: Bierut is a good guy, a revolutionary hero with "great magnanimity." In the later period of World War II, Bierut had sharp struggles with the "London government-in-exile," but the person standing behind the scenes to give Bierut ideas was Gomulka, now the Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Polish Communist Party, a gloomy, intelligent, 42-year-old middle-aged man.</p>
<p>The Polish people now all know Gomulka. Rather than "know," it is better to say "fear." During the few days I stayed in Warsaw, I talked about the general situation of the world with many Polish young people. When they talked about Gomulka, they had to look back and around to see if there were any spies "leaking military secrets." They said: Gomulka's opinions can now largely influence the "Central Politburo" of the Communist Party. He often "purges" the party, not only purging the Communist Party itself, but also purging the Polish Socialist Party.</p>
<p>This spring, Gomulka launched a "Party Merger Movement," which was strongly opposed by the two parties. It is said that the main reason for the Socialist Party's opposition was because the "right-wing" was manipulating it.</p>
<p>This is the origin of the Socialist Party's "purge." During the few days I was in Warsaw, it was a citywide sensation that Gella and many others were imprisoned and were being tried by Poland's special law for "treason." At a press conference for foreign reporters, Grochowski, Director of the International Propaganda Department, reported that these people from several countries were guilty of: being anti-Soviet, opposing the current government, and engaging in trampling and underground activities.</p>
<p>The Polish people call these people, the right-wing of the Socialist Party, wRN. I asked Director Grochowski to explain in detail the historical roots and nature of the so-called wRN, and their political propositions. Grochowski's answer was: They belong to the right-wing of the Polish Socialist Party. The Polish Socialist Party has had more than 50 years of glorious history, but this wRN faction are all stubborn and reactionary elements. The Soviets helped Poland liberate itself from the iron hooves of the Nazis, but these people insisted on being "anti-Soviet." Therefore, in the year the Lublin Revolutionary Government was established, wRN was declared an illegal political organization. Gella is one of the main figures.</p>
<p>An American reporter asked at the press conference: How can a political group with political propositions be called legal? How can it be called illegal? Is it because it is anti-Soviet that it is determined to be "illegal"? The atmosphere at the press conference at that time was quite tense. The reporter from TASS smoked a Russian cigar and pretended to be silent. Director Grochowski thought for a moment. He replied very cleverly: Of course, there are legal and illegal parties. For example, "Your country (referring to the United States) has a group called the Ku Klux Klan, which has many people and a lot of activity, but your country's laws stipulate that any activity of the Ku Klux Klan is illegal. Poland's wRN is the same!"</p>
<p>I have asked many Polish people in Warsaw and know that the main members of wRN are all people who have come from the London government-in-exile, and many are now disgraced figures. Their party platform clearly states that Poland has two major enemies, one is Nazi fascism and the other is Soviet Russia with red terror.</p>
<p>On the day Gella was tried, the government newspaper of the Socialist Party wrote an article called "The Path of the Polish Socialist Party in the Future," which was like a declaration, mentioning strengthening the friendly relations between Poland and the Soviet Union, eliminating stubborn elements within the party, and "tendencies to court capitalism."</p>
<p>This article should be regarded as the official expression of the Socialist Party. In fact, the Socialist Party after World War II is a common phenomenon in Europe. In the dispatches I wrote in France, I specially recommended the old ancestor of the Socialist Party, Leon Blum. Leon Blum is the name of a person, but also a symbol between liberalism and totalitarianism; capitalism and communism. When the contradiction between the two is not manifested, when the sharp relationship between the two has not yet exploded, this symbol can play the role of a "bridge" in any country in Europe. The bridge allowed France to squeeze into the ranks of the "Big Four" and made the relationship between Western Europe and Eastern Europe temporarily stable!</p>
<p>However, from the Truman Doctrine to the division of East and West Europe at the Paris Conference, the bridging role of the Socialist Party is collapsing day by day. Remaury in Paris actually drove the Communist Party out of the cabinet, and the Communist Party in Warsaw can naturally arrest and detain wRN. Former Polish Prime Minister Osumo-Muleski, because he does not agree with the two-party merger movement, will no longer play a role in the Socialist Party. The current "bald" Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz is said to be a person who is considered quite satisfactory by the Communist Party. At least, in Gomulka's eyes, Cyrankiewicz is a backbone of the Socialist Party who will never oppose the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>I have met with Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz, but have not met with Gomulka. Gomulka is the "Deputy Prime Minister" and Minister of the Recovered Territories in the central government, but these official titles are far less important than the Secretary-General of the Communist Party. On the third day of my arrival in Warsaw, I asked Anna Krystof, Ms. Wiesvol of the International Propaganda Department, to arrange a "private interview" with Gomulka. She contacted me for two days and asked me to see Mr. Tuski, Gomulka's private secretary first.</p>
<p>The Central Committee of the Communist Party is located at 17 Stalin Street, opposite the British Embassy, a rather majestic building in Warsaw. The strict security of the red headquarters surprised me. The first step was to check the passport photo at a window like a "ticket office," and then I was given an entry permit with a thick red diagonal line. After passing the inspection of two guards with "panda guns" on their backs, I was told to go upstairs. After being questioned by the three secretaries of the reception room, especially the issue of my newspaper's position and its relationship with the Chinese government or the Chinese Communist Party? I told them: "Shen Bao is the oldest newspaper in China. Shen Bao existed long before the founding of the Republic of China. Shen Bao has always been an independent newspaper and is not the organ of any party." The secretaries seemed very satisfied after listening, but said: "Mr. Tuski is very busy and may not be able to meet today." At that time, I really couldn't restrain myself anymore. I said: "I am a foreign reporter. I originally asked the International Propaganda Department to introduce me to Mr. Gomulka. Because Mr. Gomulka is very busy, it was agreed that I would come to see Mr. Tuski first today!" The secretaries looked surprised, and their faces seemed to say, "You are worthy to meet our Secretary-General!" (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Aid Needed Urgently for Out-of-School Youth: Hopes for Promotion of Scholarship Assistance in Various Regions - Remarks from the Person in Charge of the Youth Re-enrollment Counseling Committee</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] Since the promotion of scholarship assistance movements in various regions such as Beijing and Shanghai, they have been met with considerable sympathy and support from people in society. Today, this reporter visited the person in charge of the Ministry of Education's "Youth Re-enrollment and Employment Counseling Committee" to inquire about their views on this movement. They agreed to give the following statement: "The current semester has already begun, and students in various regions are either out of school due to their homes being in bandit-occupied areas or suffering from floods. They feel the difficulty of attending school. Even impoverished students who were originally studying at various schools are finding it nearly impossible to continue their studies due to soaring prices and excessive school fees, and are on the verge of falling back into a state of being out of school. The government's finances are difficult, and this committee is limited by its approved budget and unable to provide special subsidies to impoverished students. However, we deeply feel that the seriousness of this problem is growing and cannot be ignored. We previously issued a notice to all subordinate units, urging them to contact people and organizations in society who care about young people to establish relief service organizations for impoverished students, in order to supplement the government's efforts. In the past six months, no fewer than 150,000 young people have received assistance. Now, Beijing, Shanghai, and other regions are launching scholarship assistance movements, which are worthy of expanded promotion. Other provinces and cities also have people with strength and sympathy for students, but due to a lack of leadership, they have been unable to launch and demonstrate benevolent actions. This committee has recently telegraphed the counseling offices in various provinces and cities again, ordering them to quickly contact all sectors to launch scholarship assistance movements, expand publicity to all sectors of society, solicit scholarship funds, and encourage students to serve society, in order to help themselves and others complete their studies and become useful to the country. This will also be listed as one of the achievements of each counseling office. We sincerely hope that people in society and the press will provide more promotion and assistance, which will greatly benefit young people."</p>

<h3>New Perspectives on Urban Design: Liang Sicheng Lectures in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 31st] Renowned architect and director of the Department of Architecture at Tsinghua University, Liang Sicheng, lectured on new perspectives on urban design at the Beiping Engineering Society today. Mr. Liang is a consultant to the design committee for the United Nations headquarters building and recently returned from the United States. Mr. Liang advocates that the design of urban construction should create forms based on people's lifestyles, rather than conforming to existing forms. He believes that urban construction should not focus on the appearance of the city, but on the lives of the people. If people's lives are improved, the city will naturally reach a satisfactory state. Mr. Liang also said that the United Nations is limited by its location, and the design is quite difficult. The forty-story building on this small plot includes offices for 5,500 people, a large assembly hall, five types of council chambers, eighteen types of committee chambers, and offices for national representatives and affiliated organizations. The assembly hall must accommodate 3,500 representatives plus 1,500 journalists and audience members. Attention must be paid to technical issues such as ensuring that the entry and exit of the audience does not interfere with the meeting, and that journalists can report from the venue.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on Journalists' Day</h3>
<p>September 1st, Journalists' Day, is our own holiday as newspaper people, and it is an excellent opportunity for us to conduct a self-examination once a year.</p>
<p>China's news industry has always been considered backward. Whether in terms of content or technology, compared to the advanced countries in the newspaper industry, we are far behind. However, during the War of Resistance, after eight years of hard work by newspaper people across the country, we have made considerable progress. Although the appearance of Chinese newspapers is still difficult to fully express the characteristics of modern newspapers due to a lack of material conditions, in terms of content, we have been able to achieve the effects of modern newspapers on politics, economy, society, and culture to some extent. We can not only reflect public opinion and serve as the mouthpiece of the people, but also report accurate news in the fastest way, becoming an indispensable spiritual food for intellectuals. However, in any case, the Chinese newspaper industry is still backward. And broadly speaking, the Chinese newspaper industry is developing according to the principles of capitalism, following the path of Britain and the United States. But looking at the state of the newspaper industry in various countries around the world, there are clearly two new trends.</p>
<p>The first is the international movement for freedom of the press. Countries around the world are now demanding international freedom of the press. During the war, enlightened people in various countries, after the painful lessons of this war, all believed that the root of the war lay in the secrecy and disguise of international news before the war. If we want to create world peace after the war and hope that it can be maintained for a long time, we must seek international freedom of the press. Any current journalist can freely interview news in any country in the world, without any restrictions, freely transmit news, without any interference from the local authorities, and can publish freely, without any form of censorship. This is truly a landmark international movement. Apart from the Soviet Union, most other countries have joined. If all countries can do it without reservation, it can not only be regarded as a peace movement, but also a major innovation movement in the press.</p>
<p>The second is the domestic movement for freedom of speech. Peace-loving people generally believe that if the post-war world is to enter a new era of peace and democracy, freedom of speech within each country is also an indispensable condition. Freedom of speech is the life of democratic politics. A country without freedom of speech has no democracy to speak of. If political facilities do not allow people to freely express critical opinions, there will be no progress in politics. Apart from the parliament of democratic countries, newspapers are the only tool for expressing public opinion. Therefore, countries around the world are demanding domestic freedom of speech after the war.</p>
<p>China's newspaper industry has been stimulated by international trends and is moving towards these two goals. In recent years, through the continuous efforts of Chinese newspaper people, considerable achievements have been made in both the international movement for freedom of the press and the domestic movement for freedom of speech. But so-called freedom is by no means a matter of allowing us reporters to break through barriers and do whatever we want. As the ancients said, "One word can make a country prosper, and one word can make a country perish." Isn't it the same today? A reporter's pen is not only related to the honor and disgrace of the country and the safety of the world, but also the fate of mankind is tied to the hands of newspaper people. Democratic countries attach importance to public opinion, and any policy is based on the support of public opinion. The greater the responsibility of newspaper people, the more difficult it is for newspaper people to make good use of their freedom. Therefore, we must ask the government to pay special attention to news education for cultivating journalistic talent.</p>
<h3>What Will the United States Do About China?</h3>
<p>The presidents of various universities in Shanghai yesterday jointly telegraphed the U.S. authorities, commenting on the statement issued by Special Envoy Wedemeyer upon leaving China, and expressing their views, welcoming U.S. cooperation, but for the sake of the permanent friendship between China and the United States, if the United States provides aid to China, it should respect the dignity and sovereignty of the Chinese people who have self-esteem. The full text of this telegram is couched in tactful language, with serious and just meaning, and is neither arrogant nor humble. It can indeed express the true intentions of the Chinese people. After reading this telegram, we would also like to reiterate our feelings.</p>
<p>Special Envoy Wedemeyer's investigation in China this time, traveling all over the place, lasted for a month. It is doubtful whether he has exhausted his ability to "visit widely and consult broadly." The presidents of various universities in Shanghai are predecessors engaged in cultural and educational work in our country and hold leading positions in society. Their opinions should be valued by the U.S. government and the public. But how many presidents did Special Envoy Wedemeyer meet during his three visits to Shanghai, and did he inquire about the opinions of these scholars? Since they had no opportunity to directly inform Special Envoy Wedemeyer of their opinions, they naturally had no choice but to frankly express themselves to the U.S. authorities. The United States is a democratic country, and all policies are based on the support of public opinion. The opinions of the presidents of various universities in Shanghai can represent the opinions of the majority of intellectuals in Shanghai, and can not only serve as important information for Special Envoy Wedemeyer's report, but also for President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and members of Congress to study their policy towards China.</p>
<p>Now that the telegram from the presidents of various universities in Shanghai has been published, what are the feelings of cultural and educational figures in other places, as well as leaders from other sectors in Shanghai, after reading Special Envoy Wedemeyer's statement upon leaving China? What supervision do they have over the government, and what expectations do they have for the United States? It seems that they will not remain silent. Politics is a matter for all people, and democratic politics especially requires respect for the opinions that can truly represent the majority of people. The overall situation of the country has reached a critical juncture. If people in society are still indifferent, as if the people of Qin regarded the fatness or thinness of the people of Yue, that would be truly strange!</p>
<p>The telegram from the presidents of various universities says, "We were forced to fight Japan before other countries, and our country has become a battleground for ideological conflicts. How can we bring this suffering upon ourselves?" This point not only implies the international factors behind the Chinese war, but it is also too subtle. We believe that there is still a need for supplementation.</p>
<p>We believe that Special Envoy Wedemeyer's biggest oversight in investigating the facts this time was his failure to pay attention to the international factors behind the Chinese war and the important position of China in the Far East. As Chinese historian Fu Sinian said, "When Special Envoy Wedemeyer was measuring the Chinese situation, he did not fully recognize that China should take action in the East to oppose communism and pay attention to the Soviet Union." Frankly speaking, the United States should bear its moral responsibility for the development of the Far Eastern situation to this point. Former President of Zhongzheng University, Hu Xiansu, said that the United States "actually violated the Cairo Conference declaration and privately concluded the Yalta Agreement with the Soviet Union, selling out China." This view is also shared in the U.S. public opinion circle. For example, the neutral Chicago Daily News published an editorial the day before yesterday, pointing out that the Yalta Agreement has made the Chinese situation even more chaotic today, so it cannot but be regarded as the biggest diplomatic mistake in American history. If the Chinese Communists did not have the support of the Soviet Union, they could have been resolved long ago. As for China, it had already engaged in a life-and-death battle with the Japanese warlords when the United States was loudly advocating the "Neutrality Act," blocking the realization of Japan's dream of conquering Asia and conquering the world on the front line, resulting in eight years of protracted war and exhaustion. And now, with the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union evolving into a division of the world, China is once again caught in between. Therefore, U.S. aid to China should actually be regarded as part of the U.S. world policy.</p>
<p>In short, the relations between China and the United States are facing a new test. The situation in the Far East and even the world is also changing dramatically. Whether for the sake of peace in the Far East or for the sake of U.S. interests, the U.S. Far East policy cannot allow the United States to make another diplomatic mistake!</p>

<h3>Eleven Nations Confer on Japanese Peace Treaty: Soviet Union Declares No Intention to Participate, Insists on Discussion by Foreign Ministers' Conference</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 31st] The Soviet Union submitted a memorandum on August 29th in response to the U.S. note of August 13th urging it to participate in the preparatory meeting for the Japanese peace treaty, insisting that the Japanese peace treaty should first be preliminarily worked on by the Foreign Ministers' Conference. The memorandum believes that China is a member of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, so there is even more reason for the Japanese peace treaty to be decided first by the Foreign Ministers' Conference.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 31st] The Soviet Union stated today that it does not intend to participate in the eleven-nation conference on the Japanese peace treaty, nor does it intend to sign the treaty drafted by this conference, and is only willing to sign the treaty drafted by the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Soviet Professor Li Ming declared on the Moscow Radio's weekly English broadcast program: The U.S. proposal to convene the eleven-nation Japanese peace treaty conference violates the Potsdam Agreement, and all preliminary details of the peace treaty should be drafted by the Foreign Ministers' Conference. The Soviet Union does not recognize such conferences and does not intend to send personnel to participate. The Soviet Union also does not intend to sign the treaty drafted by this conference, and hopes that the United States will pay attention to this. Concluding a peace treaty with Japan while a state of war still exists between the Soviet Union and Japan is, technically speaking, truly a comedy. As for the so-called British Commonwealth Japanese peace treaty conference held in Canberra, I truly do not understand what achievements they hope to have, considering that the dictator of Japan, MacArthur, is willing to seriously consider the suggestions of this conference. No matter how long such methods can delay the Japanese peace treaty, the Soviet Union feels that it can only recognize the Foreign Ministers' Conference as the only body for drafting the Japanese peace treaty, which is our final position.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 31st] It was learned today that the Australian delegation and the U.S. government have repeatedly consulted on the issue of the Japanese peace treaty, and opinions have conflicted. The Australian side insists that the Japanese peace treaty should provide a guarantee of long-term occupation of Japan, while the U.S. side intends to withdraw U.S. troops stationed in Japan within the next two years. An Australian official recently told reporters that Japan has a population of 80 million, while Australia has only 8 million, a huge difference. The United States initially advocated occupying Germany for 25 years, but now intends to withdraw from Japan within two years. The policies are inconsistent. It is believed that the Japanese are now waiting for an opportunity to prepare to regain control of the Far East. If this unfortunate prediction comes true, the fate of Australia is unimaginable. The U.S. policy is unknowingly placing Japan in the same advantageous position as Germany in 1920, but as a result, Germany was able to gradually recover, causing World War II. The lesson is not far away, so be careful not to repeat it.</p>
<h3>Representatives of British Commonwealth Conference Express Opposition to U.S. Loans to Japan, but Support Allowing Japan's Economy to Achieve Independence</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Canberra, 30th] During private conversations, representatives attending the British Commonwealth Japanese peace treaty conference expressed strong opposition to the proposal, reported by authoritative sources, that MacArthur's headquarters is preparing to recommend that Japan receive loans of $500 million to develop its foreign trade. It is said that MacArthur's headquarters' suggestion is to use Japan's gold and silver as collateral for the loans, and Japanese traders in allied and neutral countries can apply to use this loan. Although the British Commonwealth conference has not formally discussed this suggestion, the representatives believe that although the Allied countries should allow the Japanese economy to achieve independence, the loans suggested by MacArthur's headquarters are not supported by the Commonwealth countries.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Cannot Be Trusted: Views of the British Army Commander</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Sydney, 31st] The Sydney "Sunday Sun" reported from Canberra on the 31st that Lieutenant General Robertson, commander of the British occupation forces in Japan, warned at the British Commonwealth conference, "We cannot trust the Japanese and should pay attention to the Japanese's superficial cooperation, as their sincerity is ultimately questionable." It is said that apart from Robertson's direct comments on Japan, there have been no official announcements on this matter at the conference in the past week. Some representatives fear that the United States may have been deceived by the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Transfer of Turtle Islands: British and Philippines to Open Negotiations</h3>

<h3>France's Economic Difficulties: Plans to Request Assistance from the United States</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 30th] According to reliable sources tonight, France's shortage of U.S. dollars is so serious that it may have to request assistance from the United States before the Marshall Plan is submitted to the U.S. Congress for discussion. The French cabinet also informed the nation today that the country is impoverished, that the people's hard work and endurance may have to continue for ten years, and that it is necessary to tighten their belts and get through the difficult times. The economic austerity plan stipulates that purchases of coal, kerosene, and food in the U.S. dollar trading area must be reduced by $293 million within the year.</p>
<h3>Britain to Cut Military: Reduce to One Million by March Next Year</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 30th] The Associated Press has learned that one of the ways the British Labour government is dealing with the current crisis is to reduce British military strength to less than one million within six months. British Chief of Staff Marshal Montgomery, who was in France inspecting the French army, flew back to London on the 30th to hold emergency talks to reduce the missions of British troops at home and abroad. British industry urgently needs manpower and military spending is strained, so the British government is said to have planned to withdraw troops stationed in Italy and Greece, reduce or withdraw British troops in Palestine, and reduce the occupation forces in Germany before March next year, while drastically shrinking British domestic defense.</p>
<h3>Important Japanese War Criminals - Unconditional Release</h3>
<p>Including Former Governor-General of Taiwan, Kobayashi, and Others</p>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 31st] Five former Japanese cabinet members, including a navy admiral, an army general, and a financial magnate, along with ten other major war criminals who have not yet been tried, were released from Sugamo Prison on the 30th. While the Allied Headquarters has not yet provided an explanation, Japanese sources claim that many of these suspects have been imprisoned for over a year. The reason for their release is that their suspicion of being war criminals has been temporarily cleared.</p>
<p>According to Japanese sources, when these individuals were released at noon on the 30th, they themselves were quite suspicious, asking the prison authorities, "Is this true?" Upon returning home after their release, their families were also skeptical for a long time. Those released include Yoshisuke Ayukawa, former director of the Manchurian Industrial Development Company; Admiral Sozo Kobayashi, former Governor-General of Taiwan; General Masaki, former military councilor; Shozo Murata, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications and Railways in the Konoe Cabinet; Tatsuo Ohta, Minister of Home Affairs in the Tojo Cabinet; Asada, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry in the Abe Cabinet from 1939 to 1940; Matsuzaki, Minister of Justice in the Tojo Cabinet; and Okabe, Minister of Education in the Tojo Cabinet.</p>

The political representatives currently stationed in these countries will be replaced by formal diplomatic envoys. Bidault happily stated, "Thursday will be one of the most pleasant days for Europe. On this difficult road to peace, we have at least seen the emergence of hope."</p>
<h3>On-the-Spot Observation of Vietnam</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Wu Jiatang, Saigon Air Mail</p>
<p>Amidst the sounds of Viet Minh-thrown grenades, French machine guns, and the popping of Saigon champagne bottles, the death knell of French colonial imperialism has already been heard. In Saigon, the sound of Viet Minh special agents' grenades exploding is almost as common as the popping of champagne bottles. In this symphony, Asian nations have risen up, fighting for civil rights and freedom. One can observe the ethnic unrest occurring throughout Southeast Asia by examining Vietnam; the motives vary, and whether those motives are pure seems unnecessary to ask. But it is a clear fact that this type of ethnic unrest has succeeded throughout Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The conflict between the Viet Minh and France has brought French Indochina, the richest of the French colonies, to the brink of bankruptcy. Before the war, French Indochina exported about 1.5 million tons of rice annually; today, if it can export 100,000 tons, France is considered very fortunate. Vietnamese rice used to be shipped abroad via Saigon, but due to the impact of Viet Minh guerrilla warfare, this rice export has been almost entirely cut off. Even if a small amount of rice can get past the guerrillas and reach Saigon's rice mills, those mills are often set on fire by Viet Minh special agents. If the rice has already been milled, these agents will find a way to sink the rice-transporting ships. Recently, six French ships sailed to Saigon to load rice, but ended up leaving without a single grain.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Vietnam have suffered heavy losses due to the war and unrest. Most of the rice mills there are run by overseas Chinese, and most of them have now been shut down, at a loss and with no prospect but to await the restoration of peace.</p>
<p>The situation of rubber plantations in Vietnam also illustrates how the Viet Minh's scorched-earth policy can destroy the French colonial economy. Before the war, Vietnam exported about 100,000 tons of rubber to France and the United States annually; since the outbreak of the French-Vietnamese war, rubber production has almost completely ceased. The Viet Minh guerrillas have adopted a scorched-earth policy and have damaged most of the rubber plantations. According to an estimate by a certain authority, only about 60% of the rubber plantations are currently planted, and only 21% of them are producing rubber. The maximum amount of rubber that the French can export this year is 25,000 tons. Experts estimate that it will take about ten years to restore the rubber plantations destroyed by the Viet Minh. A week before the reporters arrived in Saigon, four French planters were killed by Viet Minh special agents in one of Vietnam's largest rubber plantations, even though it was guarded by French soldiers. After this incident, French rubber planters were reluctant to go to Vietnam to work.</p>
<p>The impending bankruptcy of the French colonial economy is also due to the decline in Vietnam's coal production. Before the war, French Indochina produced about 200,000 to 300,000 tons of coal annually, some of which was exported (a large amount of this Tokyo coal was regularly shipped to Shanghai before the war). But currently, the coal produced by Vietnamese coal mines is only 10% to 15% of pre-war levels.</p>
<p>In order to maintain Vietnam's economic lifeline, the French have implemented various strict controls on exports and foreign exchange. Although the exchange rate between the Vietnamese currency and the US dollar is set at a ratio of seven to one, the black market exchange rate is 35 Vietnamese currency units to one US dollar. Foreign exchange is only approved for essential goods that Vietnam lacks, so that most daily necessities cannot be obtained in Vietnam.</p>
<p>The person behind this major social and economic change in Vietnam is Viet Minh leader Ho Chi Minh. Ho has been seen as colluding with the communists, but he vehemently denies any direct or indirect relationship with the Communist Party. When meeting Chinese guests, Ho often holds a copy of the "Three Principles of the People" to show that he is a follower of the Nationalist doctrine. However, it is known that his Minister of Education is a Chinese Communist Party member trained in the Communist area. It is too early to judge what contributions Ho has made to improving the living standards of the Vietnamese people, or how much freedom he can give to the Vietnamese people who have been ruled by the French colonial government for the past fifty years.</p>
<p>In the French-Vietnamese conflict, overseas Chinese suffer collateral damage. Overseas Chinese live throughout Vietnam, and in Saigon alone, there are 600,000 overseas Chinese, most of whom live in the area of ​​Cholon. Among the overseas Chinese, many are wealthy merchants with huge economic interests, but most are small businessmen and farmers with a very low level of education. Due to postal delays and a lack of transportation, they have very little contact with their homeland in normal times. There is a very important plan that our government should implement immediately, which is to improve the education level of overseas Chinese in Vietnam and establish modern transportation routes, such as the air transport service designed by China National Aviation Corporation. Once this air route is opened, it can be asserted that overseas Chinese in Vietnam will have closer ties with their homeland.</p>
<p>In general, most overseas Chinese in Vietnam pay little attention to the development of the political situation in China. Although locals sometimes discuss the various political activities of the Democratic League, the Communist Party, and the Kuomintang, most overseas Chinese are mostly preoccupied with making a living.</p>
<p>In April of this year, the communist newspaper "Vietnam Daily" was banned from publication after insulting Chairman Chiang, following a request from Chinese Consul General Yin Fengzao. At the moment, the Communist Party is publishing an underground publication called "New Sprout". At present, the power of the Vietnam Democratic League is still limited and it is gradually developing.</p>
<p>During the reporters' stay in Saigon, they were warmly welcomed by the local overseas Chinese, who expressed a strong desire to have closer ties with their homeland after China National Aviation Corporation opened a direct air route. Saigon Consul General and Chamber of Commerce Chairman Hong Qingliang held a grand tea party to welcome all the personnel of China National Aviation Corporation. (August 25th)</p>

<h3>Attempted Suicide Saved - Crime Discovered - Forged Seals to Illegally Obtain Goods - Despair from Empty Pockets Leads to Suicide Attempt</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Xue Zhonglin established the Kaitai Paint Shop on Fujian Road, and his brother, Xue Yiqing, also known as Wenqu, assisted in disaster relief work. Yiqing took advantage of his professional convenience to continuously engage in fraud, amounting to more than 40 million yuan. His elder brother, Bolin, repeatedly advised him in vain, and published a notice to sever the fraternal relationship. In May, Yiqing became unemployed and left in a fit of pique. He locked himself in Room 21 of the Changxing Hotel on Guangxi South Road, feeling extremely bored and conceiving an absurd idea. He went to a small engraving shop on Daxin Street to privately engrave several seals of his brother Zhonglin and the Kaitai Paint Shop's seals. He then asked a printing shop on Zhejiang South Road to print 50 books of Datong Bank checks, as well as his brother's name cards. He used the forged seals and receipts to defraud 15 cans of paint from the Gonghelai Paint Shop on Jixiang Street, worth 7.7 million yuan. He also defrauded 30 cans of paint from the Yizhong Paint Shop on Henan Road, worth 10.3 million yuan. After obtaining the money, he spent it lavishly, entirely in various dance halls. By the 28th of last month, he finally felt ashamed of his empty pockets and despaired of his future, and suddenly conceived a suicidal thought. In Room 100 of the Dadongxin Hotel on Yunnan South Road, he took poison to end his life. Fortunately, the tea room attendant, Xue Genxian, discovered him and reported to the cashier. He was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment and recovered. The hospital reported the situation to the Laozha Police Station, who sent police to investigate and learned of the above situation. After questioning him, he confessed everything. He will be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling the crime of forging seals.</p>

<h3>Postal Remittance Bureau - 1.3 Billion in Discounting - Far Ocean Company Implicated as Guarantor - Appeal against Provisional Execution</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Far Ocean Trading Company guaranteed Hengyu, Zhengtong, and 16 other banks and firms to apply for 1.347 billion yuan in discounting from the Shanghai Branch of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. Because the loan was not repaid when due, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau petitioned the District Court to provisionally seize the inventory of the guarantor, Far Ocean Trading Company. The Far Ocean Company received the court's ruling: "The company's existing 700 pieces of 20s Red Star cotton yarn in the Maotai Warehouse on Yangshupu Road, the Bank of Communications Warehouse, and the Four Banks Warehouse, within the amount of 2,834,298,269 yuan and 88 fen in national currency, shall be subject to provisional execution and seizure. After the debtor (referring to Far Ocean) provides the aforementioned amount as security, the provisional execution shall be suspended."</p>
<p>Reasons for Appeal</p>
<p>The Far Ocean Company expressed dissatisfaction with this ruling and yesterday submitted a petition to the District Court for referral to the High Court to file an appeal. The reasons for its appeal were summarized as follows: "In December of last year, the debtor (Far Ocean) separately guaranteed Hengyu, Zhengtong, and 16 other banks and firms to discount 1.347 billion yuan with 700 pieces of 20s Red Star cotton yarn as collateral to the creditor (Postal Remittance Bureau), holding bills of lading and discounting receipts as evidence. Because the address of the discounter, Hengyu Company, etc., could not be found, and the discounted goods were not shipped out, as of August 12th of this year, the principal and interest totaled 2,804,298,269 yuan and 88 fen in national currency, ordering the debtor to be responsible for repayment, and claiming that Zhenghe and Bachuan Banks collapsed on the same day, and the chairman of the debtor's board of directors was the same person as the chairman of the boards of directors of the two banks, and there was a connection between them. Because the debtor published a notice to sell a large number of surplus materials, it seemed to be evading debt, and there would be difficulties in execution in the future, etc. (1) Why did the creditor and the 16 companies of Hengyu, etc., not conduct sufficient investigation in advance when using cotton yarn as collateral, and were even unaware of whether the 16 companies existed, and did not investigate whether the discounted goods were real? It is not appropriate to not pay attention in advance and then catch shadows later. (2) Furthermore, the creditor urged the debtor to repay the discounted loan to Hengyu and other ten firms before it was handed over. This is not in accordance with the statutory procedures. (3) The chairman of the creditor's board of directors is the chairman of the Zhenghe and Bachuan Banks, which recently collapsed. However, the debtor is a limited liability company, and its capital, accounting, personnel, and organization are independent from each other and have no relationship with Bachuan and Zhenghe Banks." It is heard that the Postal Remittance Bureau petitioned the Ministry of Transportation to seize a ship belonging to the Far Ocean Company and also petitioned the District Court to seize the inventory of the Far Ocean Company's warehouse, with a total value of over 40 billion yuan.</p>

<h3>In the Current National Economic Difficulties, Cooperation Between the People and the Government is Needed. Fang Xianting's Broadcast on "Everyone's Responsibility in Economic Difficulties"</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] This newspaper held its 22nd Sunday special broadcast yesterday at the Greater China Continental Radio Station, inviting Fang Xianting, acting director of the China Economic Research Institute, to broadcast on "Everyone's Responsibility in Economic Difficulties." The following is a summary of his speech:</p>
<p>Two years have passed since the victory, and today, the degree of economic difficulty in the country is even greater than during the Anti-Japanese War, which no one expected. The ominous symbol of the economic crisis and the root cause of the people's suffering lies in the ever-rising price problem. The reason for rising prices is that too much currency has been issued, and the reason for the excessive issuance of currency is that the government's fiscal revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced, so it has to rely on issuing currency to make up for the deficit. However, when too much currency is issued and prices rise, the government needs more money to purchase real goods such as military grain and uniforms, and the salaries of public officials and soldiers are also adjusted accordingly, so the government's expenditure increases even more; while revenue decreases in real value due to rising prices, so the imbalance between revenue and expenditure becomes even greater, and the amount of currency to be issued increases even more. Thus, the more currency is issued, the more prices rise, creating a vicious cycle. This is the painful reality we have witnessed and experienced in recent years.</p>
<p>How to Maintain Stable Prices</p>
<p>The way to solve the problem at its root is to ensure that prices remain unchanged or rise only slightly after the government increases the issuance of currency. In this way, the government does not have to issue more currency, or the amount it needs to issue becomes less and less. However, to maintain stable prices or only a slight increase, the most fundamental way is to ensure that after the government increases the issuance of currency, it can immediately recover the currency from the people. Transfer the purchasing power in the hands of the people to the government, allowing the government to purchase goods. This method of recovering currency includes taxes, public bonds, and special donations. Taxes and public bonds are the main methods used in the United Kingdom and the United States. However, China's tax system is unsound, profit tax and income tax are not feasible, and public bonds cannot be sold, so the government has to use the sale of gold, the sale of enemy property, and surplus materials to recover legal tender. However, these materials are limited, and the government's need to expand currency is too great, so this method quickly failed.</p>
<p>Secondly, if the quantity of goods produced can also increase sharply with the increase in the amount of currency, prices will not rise too sharply. Because the price is the ratio of goods to legal tender, if there is more legal tender and the same amount of goods, the average price will not rise. Originally, when currency begins to inflate and prices rise, it stimulates the increase in production. Because the price of products rises, the price of raw materials purchased is low, and wages are fixed in the short term, so the profit of industrial production increases, and entrepreneurs all want to expand production. However, under the continuous expansion of currency, this favorable expansion has its limits. Because everyone expands production and competes to purchase raw materials, the price of raw materials soon rises; and because general prices rise, workers also demand higher wages. After a considerable period, the relative price of raw materials and wages may rise faster and higher than the price of products, that is, the selling price of industrial products is not even enough to cover their reproduction costs, so that continuing production is not only unprofitable but also a loss. At this time, they hoard raw materials and sell them at high prices, which is more profitable than engaging in production. If the government gives them low-interest loans to purchase raw materials, their profits from hoarding raw materials will be even greater, so everyone will compete to hoard raw materials. At this time, production will not only fail to increase but will also decrease. According to our statistics, Chongqing reached this stage in 1941 during the Anti-Japanese War, and Shanghai also reached this stage from 1944 during the war. In this way, the amount of currency increases, the amount of goods decreases, and the degree of price increase is further aggravated.</p>
<p>The Poor Become Poorer and the Rich Become Richer</p>
<p>Another misfortune for China's industrial production after the war was the government's erroneous foreign exchange policy, which dealt a blow to industrial production. In early 1946, when foreign trade resumed, the government set the foreign exchange value of legal tender very high, stipulating that the exchange rate for the US dollar was 2020 legal tender per US dollar. Under this exchange rate, cheap American goods were imported in large quantities, and there were no import controls at the time, so domestic industrial production was in danger of collapse due to competition from cheap and good foreign goods. At that time, the government did this in an attempt to suppress domestic prices by importing cheap foreign goods; as a result, prices were temporarily stabilized, but in less than a few months, the government's large foreign exchange resources were almost exhausted, and the import of foreign goods had to be restricted, which finally led to the jump in prices after the winter of last year. Because foreign exchange is exhausted, various raw materials and products needed for current industry cannot be imported in sufficient quantities, and production is further suffocated. The soaring prices in the first half of this year, which have risen tens of thousands of times, cannot be excused from the mistakes of past policies.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the higher the price rises, the more currency is issued, which creates an extremely unreasonable distribution problem. We know that currency is equivalent to a head tax, and everyone bears the same amount regardless of wealth, which has resulted in the wealthier people feeling less of a burden; at the same time, in the process of currency inflation, although the government has controls, they have not been thorough, and the wealthy class has been able to take advantage of the opportunity of soaring prices to engage in speculative activities, hoarding and profiteering, making huge profits; so the poor become poorer and the rich become richer. In addition, various low-interest production loans and past policies on the sale of gold and foreign exchange have all provided the greatest convenience to the wealthy, further creating a large concentration of wealth.</p>
<p>Working Together to Overcome Difficulties</p>
<p>In the extremely chaotic and painful economic situation of the country, the arrival of the Wedemeyer Mission once brought hope to the people, believing that the United States could help us overcome economic difficulties. In fact, this hope is the most humiliating. We must solve our own problems, and we must overcome the current difficulties through our own efforts. How to overcome these difficulties requires the joint efforts and cooperation of the government and the people; the government has its responsibilities, and the people also have their responsibilities.</p>
<p>In terms of the government's responsibility, after the destruction of the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, when the people urgently need to recuperate, it is an unavoidable measure to implement the pacification policy, which should take into account the strength of the country and the lives of the people. Under the pacification policy, the government should implement a tight fiscal policy and should use special methods to raise revenue. Regarding the source of war expenses, the "National Construction Special Donation" should be implemented immediately, and the rich should take out money. The government should also reduce current expenditures as much as possible to achieve absolute balance between revenue and expenditure.</p>
<p>While the government is implementing the above reforms, the people must also cooperate with the government and fulfill their responsibilities. For example, if the government wants to hold a "National Construction Special Donation," the wealthy should look at the suffering of the general public and donate generously for the sake of the country and for their own sake. Many people are now fleeing their assets abroad. Is it really possible to not need a country if you have money? This action will cause the world to look down on us.</p>
<p>Secondly, the general businessmen and speculators must take responsibility. We all know that because everyone rushes to buy goods when they have money, the velocity of currency circulation has greatly increased. This requires the general public to automatically cooperate with the government. If the people do not rush to buy goods at any time, then no matter how much currency the government issues, prices will not rise so much. To stop prices from rising, it will be easier to start solving all problems. Whether China's current economic difficulties can be overcome depends on whether the government and the people can do what is said above.</p>

<h3>Taizhou Guildhall Locked Down; Police Officers Arresting Gamblers Softly Imprisoned</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Taizhou Guildhall on Jumen Road in the Nanshi District recently raised funds to hold a Taoist ritual. The Songshan Police Sub-Bureau learned that some people were taking the opportunity to gamble, so around 10 PM the night before, Officer Bao of the Judicial Section led police officers to the scene, arrested 24 gamblers on the spot, seized more than one million yuan in gambling money and many gambling tools, and took them all back to the bureau for punishment. Unexpectedly, at 5 PM yesterday afternoon, they received another tip that the guildhall was still gambling. Section Chief Shen Zuoluo immediately ordered section members Zhang Jingfang and Chen Linshu to supervise more than ten plainclothes police officers and rush to the scene in a police car. As soon as they entered the gate, the police saw only three mahjong tables. Just as they were about to return to the bureau, they learned that more than 200 people had gathered there and locked the gate, softly imprisoning all the police officers inside. Fortunately, a chauffeur climbed over the wall and ran to the nearby Liyuan Road Police Station to report the incident. He also telegraphed the sub-bureau to send a large number of police officers from the security police squadron and all uniformed police officers to rush to the scene, break down the gate, and rescue the police officers. At the same time, they arrested 20 troublemakers, including Tong Ruying, and took them to the bureau along with three sets of mahjong tiles for investigation.</p>

Therefore, Chairman Chiang specially ordered Zhu Shaoliang, director of the Chongqing Executive Headquarters, to take the opportunity of inspecting the four southwestern provinces to convey the central government's care and goodwill to the people on behalf of the government.</p>
<p>Director Zhu set off from Chongqing on August 1. At that time, General Zhu had just recovered from his illness, but he embarked on a strenuous journey, and decided to travel by car all the way, which shows his hard work. He first inspected Chengdu, Ya'an, Rongshan and other places in Sichuan, and then set off from Luzhou, Sichuan on August 15, passing through Xuyong, Bijie, Weining, Xuanwei, and arrived in Kunming on the afternoon of the 18th along the Sichuan-Guizhou East Road. Various agencies and people's organizations in Kunming had already prepared a warm welcome. In addition to the provincial government sending special personnel and cars to meet him, the Gucheng Gutong Park in the east of the city was crowded with people at noon on the 19th, waiting for the arrival of the representative of the head of state.</p>
<p>At 2:07 PM, a row of Samsung jeeps slowly drove into the urban area amidst the melodious sound of military music. General Zhu looked radiant and dignified. He was first greeted by Chairman Lu into the Guqu Garden for a short rest. That day, officials gathered and the event was extremely grand. It was another rare grand event in Kunming since the visit of Commander-in-Chief Guan. Everyone's emotions were very enthusiastic. General Zhu exchanged greetings and chatted with Chairman Lu, Inspector Zhang, Director Deng, Commander-in-Chief He, and Chairman of the Council, showing no signs of fatigue. Then, amidst a burst of military music, he went to Jinbi Villa to rest. The reporter Hua Deng got into a small car and followed him to the residence. After waiting for a while, General Zhu</p>
<p>Received the reporter in military uniform.</p>
<p>He said that although the journey was relatively hard, it was much better than in the Northwest in terms of geographical environment, humanities, climate, transportation, etc. The purpose of this trip was to represent Chairman Chiang in comforting the people of the four provinces, and also to inspect the general military administration and public security in the Southwest, and to give instructions on the mobilization for pacification. The southwestern provinces made great contributions during the war. Since the victory and the return of the capital, Chairman Chiang has always been thinking of the people of the southwestern provinces. Since General Zhu took office in June, he has been aware that military administration, economy, transportation, education, culture, and border defense in the four provinces all need to know more about the</p>
<p>Rich local conditions.</p>
<p>Therefore, he decided to personally make a long-distance tour, regardless of the hardship.</p>
<p>Sichuan Province has advantageous geographical environment and economic conditions. Although the impression of Yunnan is not deep, it is rich in human and material resources and has a bright future. As for the border areas of Guizhou, they are too poor, and the people's lives need to be improved. General Zhu spoke in a Fujian accent, expressing his tour impressions. When talking about the public security issue in Xikang, he replied to the reporter with great confidence. There is no need to worry about bandits. The central government's forces are sufficient to suppress them.</p>
<p>For several days in a row, there were banquets and evening parties. Famous actors from Kunming and Yunnan were mobilized together, and the scene was unprecedentedly grand. He summoned military and agency chiefs to give instructions, and inspected the 26th Division stationed in Kunming. He was busy all day and worked extremely hard. On the 23rd, at the invitation of Chairman Lu, he went to the hot springs for a short rest, and talked with various officials, giving instructions on important matters. The "No. 1 Hot Spring in the World" was of great benefit to Director Zhu's foot ailment. It is said that after several days of washing, the foot ailment has been completely cured, and</p>
<p>Walking is very strong.</p>
<p>Unlike the uneasiness on the journey. In order to continue to inspect Guizhou, and also to go to Beijing to participate in the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, General Zhu, although he had many good feelings about Yunnan, had to decide to leave Kunming on the 28th. He said: After returning from Nanjing, I would like to stay in Kunming for a few months. From this, it can be seen that Director Zhu has a very deep and good impression of Kunming.</p>

<h3>Comparison of Prices in Southwest China: Chengdu is the Most Expensive, Hezhang is the Cheapest</h3>
<p>[Report from our Kunming office, 27th] General Zhu Shaoliang is very concerned about the people's livelihood during this trip to the Southwest. He told our reporter: During this trip, he visited local customs and investigated people's lives. He has a clearer comparison of prices in various places. The cost of living in Chengdu is the most expensive, and life in Hezhang, Guizhou is the cheapest. Eggs are only 50 yuan each, and rice is only 40,000 yuan per dan. Crossing the border of Guizhou, prices are climbing again. By the time you get to Kunming, they are already at a peak. (Lian)</p>

<h3>Worshipping Confucius? Honoring Teachers? More Than 200 Students in Anyang Destroy the Main Hall of the Zhengzhou Confucius Temple</h3>
<p>[Report from our Zhengzhou office, 28th] After the ceremony of worshipping Confucius and the conference of honoring teachers were held in the main hall of the Zhengzhou Confucius Temple on Teachers' Day, it was destroyed at 7 PM that night by more than 200 students from Anyang County Middle School and County Teachers' School who fled to Zhengzhou. This is a very regrettable incident in the midst of the movement of honoring teachers and valuing education. The main hall of the Confucius Temple here is the Tianshi Auditorium of the Zheng County Teachers' School, which houses some of the Anyang students who fled to Zhengzhou. The Zheng County Teachers' School, in order to commemorate Confucius' birthday on the 27th, notified the resident students to temporarily move out in accordance with the order, so as to hold a memorial meeting. On the evening of the same day, more than 200 Anyang students, led by teacher Qu Cha, went to the school to negotiate for continuing to stay, and a conflict occurred with Wang, the school's clerk, which caused a martial arts drama. At that time, all the teachers and students of the Zheng Teachers' School in the school were driven out of the school by the Anyang students, and the school gate was tightly closed and locked, and they carried out destruction. Then, the county magistrate and others rushed to the scene after hearing the news, but the order was already chaotic. As a result, the county magistrate and the chairman of the county council persuaded them to calm down. The Anyang students who fled to Zhengzhou are temporarily staying in various middle schools in Zhengzhou. Now, various middle schools have issued expulsion orders to the Anyang students because the school opening period is approaching. Some of the Anyang students staying in the Provincial Middle School were thrown out of their shops a few days ago. Therefore, this incident can be said to contain a retaliatory meaning.</p>

<h3>More Than Ninety Opium Dens in Xiamen, Only a Dozen Raided, Continued Suppression Urgently Needed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 27th] In 1846, China was forced to open five ports for trade after losing the Opium War. Xiamen was one of them. Subsequently, the British privately shipped opium from Hong Kong to Xiamen for sale, and opium dens emerged in response. Moreover, because Xiamen and Taiwan face each other across the sea, Taiwanese rogues were instigated by the Japanese ruling authorities to engage in espionage activities in Xiamen. These people had no legitimate occupations and did their utmost to protect opium and gambling activities. During the eight years of Xiamen's occupation during the War of Resistance, there were more than 300 opium dens at their peak, which was tantamount to openly dealing in and consuming drugs.</p>
<p>After the restoration, the opium trade entered a secret phase, but the toxic atmosphere still permeated the city. Drugs shipped from Hong Kong and Shantou to Fujian used Xiamen as a distribution center. Under the protection of special forces, there were still more than 90 secret opium dens in the city. Recently, the authorities have raided more than a dozen, but it is still far from being completely eradicated. It is urgently hoped that the authorities will continue to strictly suppress drugs.</p>

<h3>Strengthening Atomic Energy Research and Paying Attention to Basic Science: Seven Scientific Organizations' Joint Annual Meeting Discusses Special Topics Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The joint annual meeting of seven scientific organizations, including the China Science Society, was held for the second day yesterday. Papers were read at the Shanghai Medical College in the morning. At 3 p.m., special topics were discussed at the China Science Society: (1) Ways to improve China's scientific education; (2) Atomic energy and peace. More than 150 members attended, chaired by Yan Jici and Cao Xingqing. The discussions were candid and enthusiastic, and it was generally believed that the development of science should benefit mankind and that atomic energy should not be used as a weapon of war. Chinese scientists should cooperate with scientists from all countries to strive for the creation of human happiness and world peace. There were several conclusions: (1) Atomic energy should be used for peaceful construction; (2) China should strengthen its research on atomic energy and should start from the basics, that is, pay attention to the overall progress of basic science; (3) The government should attach importance to basic science and allocate special funds for atomic energy research; (4) Scientists should have their own sense of responsibility and have a social awareness of justice, morality, and responsibility to society, the country, and even mankind. As for the issue of improving China's scientific education, it was unanimously agreed that the scientific equipment of various educational and research institutions in China is insufficient, and the salaries of researchers are so low that they are not enough to maintain their lives, let alone research? The government should find a fundamental solution. Basic and social education is more important than school education, and scientific education should be integrated with people's lifestyles in the future. There are also several concrete suggestions that the government is advised to adopt. The meeting adjourned at about 7 p.m. At 4 p.m., Bing Zhi gave a public lecture on "The Path of Life" at the National School of Mechanical Engineering.

<h3>Upheaval at China College in Beiping: Board of Directors Performs Double-Wrap Case, Two Factions of Students Each Promoting, Nearly Staging Martial Drama</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 31st] An upheaval has occurred again at the private China College, with fierce fighting between two factions of students. One faction is to expel Secretary-General Chao Qingchang and Director of General Affairs Han Daozhi and support Wang Zhengting's return to the school; the other faction is to support Chao and Han and oppose Wang Zhengting. The two factions have been in conflict for several days, each claiming that their supported "Board of Directors" has been approved by the Ministry of Education. Therefore, there is also a "double-wrap case" dispute.

Some students supporting Chao and Han tore down the slogans promoting Chao and Han at 3:00 p.m., replaced them with those supporting Chao and Han, and pointed to Wang Zhengting as a "bureaucrat official." The two factions nearly staged a martial drama. The reporter heard from Lu Fu that he had telegraphed Wang Zhengting in Shanghai yesterday, asking him to come to Beiping to preside over the matter within three days, and that he would not be responsible after three days. Lu Fu has not yet obtained the cooperation of the faculty association. The list of the board of directors referred to by the two factions, those of Chao and Han's side are Kong Xiangxi, Li Zongren, Chen Guofu, Chen Bulei, Hu Shi, Gu Zhongxiu, Wang Tongling, He Siyuan, Wu Zhuren, and Li Zheng, etc.; those of Wang's side are Wang Zhaohui, Zou Lu, Zhang Ji, Gu Zhongxiu, Sun Ke, Lu Fu, Mo Dehui, Xu Shiying, Tang Yueliang, Shang Zhen, and Xue Xueshuai, Qian Yongming, etc., fifteen people. It remains to be seen which one has been approved, pending a statement from the Ministry of Education.</p>
<h3>Private School Fee Issues</h3>
<p>The Primary and Secondary School Joint Association Issues a Statement</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The amount of fees charged by private primary and secondary schools in the city was agreed upon at a tea party convened by the mayor with the principals of each school on August 26. The reporter visited Jiang Jizhou, chairman of the Primary and Secondary School Joint Association, yesterday, who issued the following statement: The highest amount of tuition and miscellaneous fees charged by private primary and secondary schools in the city, as stipulated by the members' congress, is 1.2 million yuan for high school, 900,000 yuan for junior high school, and 600,000 yuan for primary school. Now, following the suggestions of Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan, and after deliberation by the joint meeting of directors and supervisors: (1) Each school should increase the number of free places for poor students as much as possible. (2) The maximum amount remains unchanged, but the total amount of tuition and miscellaneous fees charged by general schools should not exceed 1 million yuan for high school, 800,000 yuan for junior high school, and 500,000 yuan for primary school in principle. Those with special needs who need to increase the fee to the maximum amount should immediately report to the Municipal Education Bureau for approval. (3) The financial situation of each school should be made public, and the method should be implemented in accordance with the resolution of the fourth members' congress. During this period of suppressing turmoil and building the country, it is hoped that the teachers of each school will maintain the spirit of hard work and sacrifice in the past and jointly maintain education.</p>

<h3>Zhen Ya Overcomes Three Obstacles: Yong Sha Also Bows Its Head Yesterday</h3>
<p>Three Thousand Spectators Fight a Hard Four-Set Decisive Battle</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Beiping Ji Ya volleyball expeditionary force defeated Yong Sha, the champion of the Zhen Cup, last night by a score of 2-1. (1) 21-16, (2) 21-16, (3) 11-21, (4) 21-17. Xu Heng did not play, which diminished Yong Sha's performance. Qi Zengju, the captain of Zhen Ya, was ill, but insisted on playing to help when the third set was lost, but was eventually stopped by the entire team. The battle was tense and exciting. There were more than 2,000 spectators last night, a grand occasion not seen since Zhen Ya's expedition to Shanghai. The atmosphere was enthusiastic. Before the game, commemorative banners were presented to each other. The visiting team was originally scheduled to have four matches in Shanghai. It is now known that an additional charity match will be added on the 4th of this month (Thursday), with the visiting team and Yong Sha playing again, starting at 7:30 PM at the gymnasium. The ticket revenue will be used for disaster relief for the floods in Guangdong and Guangxi. There is no match today. Tomorrow night, Zhen Ya will play against Hua Ji.</p>
<p>There were more than 2,000 spectators last night, but most of those upstairs were armed comrades who were treated free of charge. The order at the stadium was poor. Women, children, and the elderly crowded into the barbed wire fences, taking pride in squatting on both sides, which can be called a grand event.</p>
<p>Referees Chen Baolin and Zhang Le. Zhen Ya led throughout the first set, resulting in a score of 21-16. In the second set, the visiting team still took the lead, 11-6. Yong Sha once forced a close situation of 14-16, but it was fleeting, and Zhen Ya won two consecutive sets with a score of 21-16. At the beginning of the third set, Yong Sha changed its lineup again, and indeed won a set with a score of 21-11. In the crucial fourth set, the score fluctuated and was unstable. Yong Sha fought hard, trailing 8-11 in the first half of the set. The visiting team finally completed the set with a score of 21-17. In conclusion, 3-1, the visiting team won three out of three matches.</p>

<h3>Textile Construction Strives for Overseas Cloth Market; Signs Agency Sales Contracts with Overseas Chinese Merchants; If Trial Implementation Is Effective, Warehouses Will Be Established in Various Locations</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In order to explore the overseas market for domestically produced cloth and enrich the country's foreign exchange resources, the China Textile Construction Company has recently been sparing no effort to promote cloth exports. According to a person in charge of the company speaking to reporters, the company's cloth sales to various parts of Southeast Asia, such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Siam, the Philippines, and areas with concentrated overseas Chinese, will temporarily adopt the agency sales method. The decision to entrust a centralized joint venture company or individual companies to act as agents will depend on the degree of trade freedom in each location. As for areas in the Near East, Middle East, such as Iran, Syria, Abyssinia, and the Americas, such as Mexico, where there are few overseas Chinese and the situation is relatively isolated, the company sells to various export trading houses in the city for direct export.</p>
<p>The company's entrustment of various companies to act as agents for cloth sales in Southeast Asia is currently in the trial stage. If the trial implementation is successful, the next step in the plan is to imitate the way Mobil, Asiatic, and Texaco gasoline companies set up oil depots in various locations, and establish warehouses in Hong Kong, Singapore, Siam, Manila, and other places to regularly stock the cloth needed in various locations, so that goods can flow smoothly and supply and demand can be adjusted in various locations, so that the funds of the various agency sales companies can also be circulated. At the same time, this will allow the company to maintain a reasonable and stable market price for cloth sales in various locations. The agency sales contracts that the company has currently signed include Hong Kong, Singapore, and Siam. The agency sales contract for the Philippines is expected to be signed within the week. Among the contracts that have been signed, the contracts for Hong Kong and Singapore entrust the China National Products Joint Venture Company to act as an agent for sales. The contracts were signed one and a half months ago, and both locations have already tried selling a batch of cloth. The Siam contract was only signed on August 27th. In Siam, the China United Company, which is jointly funded by 80 or 90 Chinese business firms engaged in the cloth industry in the area, came forward to sign the agency sales contract. The first batch of trial sales goods includes 500 bales of cotton yarn and 20,000 bolts of cotton cloth of various colors, and is currently awaiting loading and shipment to Siam. The agency sales contract for the Philippines is currently under negotiation, and there should be a breakthrough within the week. According to comparisons, the market price of cloth in Southeast Asia is currently better in Siam, and there is less competition from foreign goods, making it a good overseas market.</p>
<h3>Minister of Public Debt Chen Bingzhang Discusses the Issue of Foreign Currency Bond Repayments: US Dollar Bonds Will Still Be Repaid in Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>After the revision of the regulations for managing foreign exchange, should the short-term US dollar treasury bills of the 36th year continue to be issued and how should they be repaid? The Ministry of Finance, considering that this matter concerns the government's creditworthiness and involves other foreign currency bonds, has thoroughly discussed and drafted measures, which were submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval on the 20th. The details of repaying the principal and interest at the exchange rate quoted by designated banks and continuing to issue short-term treasury bills have been reported in previous newspapers. Minister of Public Debt Chen Bingzhang of the Ministry of Finance came to Shanghai on official business the other day, and reporters visited him yesterday to inquire about the details. His answers are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding this case, the Ministry received an order from the Executive Yuan on the 30th night and immediately telegraphed the Central Bank to investigate and instruct compliance. It is expected that the 36th year treasury bills can be resumed for sale in various locations from today (the 1st).</p>
<p>(2) The phrase "various foreign currency bonds" mentioned in the Executive Yuan's order, which are to be converted at the market price of designated banks, refers to the foreign currency bonds issued in the 27th, 29th, and 31st years. As for the US dollar bonds of the 36th year, which were previously specially approved by the National Government to be repaid in foreign exchange, they should still be handled in accordance with the original regulations and will not be converted into national currency. The first installment of principal and interest funds for these bonds, which are due at the end of September this year, has already been allocated by the government to the Fund Management Committee for safekeeping and payment.</p>
<p>(3) Short-term treasury bills for the 38th year, totaling more than 27.4 million US dollars, have been sold. The interest payable on this portion is approximately 9.6 million US dollars. The end of September this year is the first installment for repaying the principal and interest, and the principal and interest funds have also been allocated to the Fund Management Committee for safekeeping.</p>
<p>(4) The issuance amounts of the gold bonds in the 27th and 29th years were 10 million British pounds and 50 million US dollars, respectively, but only a portion was sold. The remainder was mortgaged to national banks. The outstanding principal and interest on the sold portion is currently approximately 1.34 million British pounds and 25.6 million US dollars. The gold bonds of the 27th year are to be repaid in 30 installments over 15 years, and 8 years, or 16 installments, have already been repaid. The gold bonds of the 29th year are to be repaid in 50 installments over 25 years, and 5 years, or 10 installments, have already been repaid.</p>
<p>(5) The issuance amount of the Allied Victory US dollar bonds in the 31st year was 100 million US dollars, all of which were sold. They are to be repaid in 20 installments over 10 years, and 3.5 years, or 7 installments, have already been repaid. The outstanding principal and interest is currently approximately 97.2 million US dollars. As for the US dollar savings bonds of the 31st year, also totaling 100 million US dollars, approximately 19 million US dollars of principal is currently due.</p>
<p>(6) Payment of interest subsidies for purchasing the US dollar bonds of the 36th year should be calculated based on the market price of US dollars quoted by designated banks. The Ministry has telegraphed the Central Bank to investigate and handle this. The remaining technical issues arising from issuing treasury bills and repaying bonds at market prices will be discussed and decided in consultation with the National Bank.</p>
<p>(7) The government's decision to pay the principal and interest of foreign currency bonds at the market price quoted by designated banks will inevitably increase the burden on the national treasury. However, the authorities are still resolutely doing so, demonstrating their utmost intention to maintain the country's creditworthiness. Minister Yu of the Ministry has made a statement on this important measure, and I will not elaborate further. However, I hope that the people and the government will cooperate sincerely to implement rational financial policies. On the one hand, the government should establish creditworthiness, and on the other hand, the people should recognize and subscribe to bonds. If public debt policies can be implemented smoothly in the future, it will not only benefit the reduction of inflation, but also show our nation's determination to rely on its own efforts.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Merchants in the Philippines Establish a Joint Venture Company</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Philippine overseas Chinese merchants Zhonghua, Huadong, Huatong, Shengxing, Nantong, Xinghua, Zhendong, and others, in order to negotiate and manage the sale of cloth from the Textile Construction Company in the Philippines, sent representatives to Shanghai to discuss with the Textile Construction authorities several times. It is now known that the seven overseas Chinese merchants have decided to jointly invest with the Shanghai cloth export merchants Jianhua, Damao, and others to establish a joint venture company for the sale of cloth in the Philippines, with a capital amount of 1 million US dollars. The head office will be located in Manila, and an office will be established in Shanghai. The joint venture company will come forward this week to sign a contract with the Textile Construction Company for the agency sales of cloth in the Philippines. It is said that the first batch of trial sales goods is expected to be 50,000 bolts of cotton cloth of various colors, with printed cloth and bleached cloth accounting for the majority. It is said that when the Textile Construction Company delivers the goods, the joint venture company will first pay 80% of the payment, and a bank will guarantee the remaining 20%, which will be settled after the cloth is sold in the Philippines. At the same time, the Textile Construction Company will also send personnel to the Philippines to monitor the agency sales situation.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Formulates Measures for Paying Yarn After Agent Spinning of Imported Cotton</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the foreign cotton allocated to various yarn mills under the first and second quarter foreign cotton quotas of the Import Quota Allocation Office, the Central Bank previously consulted with the Textile Adjustment Committee and decided to have the government take back this cotton and hand it over to the yarn mills that obtained quota allocations for agent spinning and payment of yarn. The foreign exchange and other expenses paid by the factories for ordering foreign cotton have been directly returned by the Central Bank with interest, and the factories should provide payment receipts and other documents to the Central Bank for registration. As for the portion of foreign cotton allocated in the second quarter that has not yet been settled but has been ordered, the factories can still apply according to the prescribed procedures, submit the relevant documents, and have the bank review and forward them to the China and Citibank for processing without having to pay additional national currency, in order to reduce the procedures for returning and settling foreign exchange and simplify the process. As for the agent spinning labor payment profit and yarn collection payment, the Central Bank and the Textile Adjustment Committee have discussed and formulated the following measures:</p>
<p>(1) For the outstanding foreign exchange and additional fees under the import of foreign cotton in the two quarters, please have the Central Bank directly allocate the funds immediately. The application procedures for the re-import permit will still be handled by the factories as usual.</p>
<p>(2) The cost of purchasing cotton paid by the factories for foreign exchange settlement will be calculated at a monthly interest rate of 9%. Other financial preparation expenses will be calculated under the labor payment according to the actual situation.</p>
<p>(3) When the foreign cotton arrives, from the date of obtaining the customs permit, the factories should start paying yarn according to the prescribed period on the 30th day (20 days for handling lifting and entering the warehouse, and 10 days for manufacturing). The number of yarns paid daily, in addition to the yarns for general exchange and the yarns to be paid to the government, should not be less than half of the remaining amount produced at that time.</p>
<p>(4) The yarn payment price will be determined and announced in the upper ten days of each month according to the cost plus profit formula. The yarn payment for this month will be paid at the price set last month, with adjustments and settlements made when the price for that month is determined.</p>
<p>(5) The monthly price will be discussed and announced within the first seven days of the following month.</p>
<p>(6) The yarn collection for August will temporarily start with a payment price of 3.5 million yuan, and the settlement will be made after the price is determined in early September.</p>
<p>(7) The cost calculation should consider the four factors of "scale of state-owned and private enterprises," "newness of establishment," and region.</p>
<p>(8) The industry should provide the settlement of various advances for the purchase of cotton, etc., within three days of receiving the letter for return.</p>
<p>(9) Please have the Textile Adjustment Committee verify the amount of yarn paid by each factory and the time period, and issue a table to notify the six district trade associations to forward it to each factory for compliance with the deadline for yarn payment.</p>
<p>(10) Please have the six district associations draft matters that each factory should handle regarding the agent spinning part of foreign cotton and ask the Textile Adjustment Committee to approve and implement it.</p>

<p>Free Talk: Special Edition for Journalists' Day</p>
<h3>Where Is the Welfare of the Fourth Estate?</h3>
<p>— Sen Lin</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw once bluntly said, "Journalism is the highest form of literature; because all the highest literature is journalism." To be a journalist is, spiritually speaking, respectable enough.</p>
<p>Despite the existence of yellow journalism and capitalist newspapers in the 20th century, our country's so-called Fourth Estate—humbly speaking, the level below the third-class commoners—still cannot be said to be the typical model of a poor scholar.</p>
<p>Apart from a few superior exceptions in large cities, the majority of journalists across the country are perhaps still in a state of semi-starvation, just like public education personnel. The difference is that society, though unable to help public education personnel, at least extends some sympathy to them, while journalists are sometimes disliked by a section of special interest groups.</p>
<p>We often hear seniors in the industry say that journalists should not overestimate themselves in order to maintain a proper position, but they should also not overestimate themselves in order to avoid detaching from reality. This saying is truly unbreakable. From the perspective of journalists themselves, no one can deny that capitalism is an employment relationship. Furthermore, are so-called journalists not a group of intellectual laborers who write and edit?</p>
<p>The Geneva International Labour Office once compiled a survey report entitled "Working and Living Conditions of Journalists," which gathered a wealth of information on the working and living conditions of journalists in various countries. In terms of content, from the perspective of laborers, the more important aspects include dismissal and labor disputes. Working conditions include working hours, night work, weekly rest, annual leave, and wages. In addition, there is a chapter that is of personal concern to every journalist, namely the "labor market" for the issue of food, which investigates various information on unemployment and job seeking.</p>
<p>Journalism sounds like a freelance profession, but in reality, this profession is actually a cultural worker. In terms of material compensation, it is far inferior to doctors, lawyers, etc. Doctors can set their own consultation examples and charge fees at will, but journalists who can set their own publishing rates are probably one in a hundred. If doctors declare in advance that they can refuse house calls late at night, journalists who are engaged in editing work are considered to take it for granted that they work nervously until dawn every day.</p>
<p>Journalists often tell people that we must stand before the era to lead society, so why don't we have a concrete and substantial plan for the health protection, occupational protection, and all welfare undertakings of ourselves! In today's era of scientific development, why are the living conditions of newspaper employees still the same as they were fifty years ago?</p>
<p>Today, on Journalists' Day "September 1," can we take this issue as one of the topics for future research?</p>
<h3>Proposal for a "Journalists' Annual Meeting"</h3>
<p>— Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>Since journalism is a specialized academic discipline, journalists should be practitioners and researchers of this discipline. Their status is academically equivalent to engineers, geological experts, and water conservancy experts. Since the advent of newspapers in China, the general public has had a misunderstanding of journalists, namely that as long as one is familiar with writing, one can serve as a journalist. Therefore, journalism as an academic discipline has not made much progress to this day. I remember that during the War of Resistance, the wartime capital Chongqing had an organization called the Journalism Society. The directors and supervisors of the society were all leaders in the national journalism industry. They were busy with their daily affairs, so they did not make significant progress. I personally, perhaps representing the general journalists, have a hope that there can be an organization for the Journalists' Annual Meeting. At this annual meeting, the insights that journalists usually research can be shared with the public, the practical work can be reported to the public, and papers on journalism can be read to the public. To participate in this annual meeting, one must have made considerable contributions to the journalism industry, must provide practical and concrete examples, or be a researcher of journalism, or have received specialized journalism education, or have received higher education and worked in a journalism position for two or three years.</p>
<p>Some people may ask, "Journalists are busy all the time, where do they have the time to participate in this annual meeting?" I say, we can elect representatives to bring our own research insights, work reports, and academic papers to the meeting to read. At the same time, a person who is a journalist should have traveled all over the world, and can take this opportunity to visit the location where the annual meeting is held.</p>
<p>Academics have no class. If journalists are interested in journalism and want to promote journalism forward, this Journalists' Annual Meeting is indeed necessary to hold.</p>
<h3>Provincial Journalists' Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>— Lu Lu</p>
<p>In order to unite journalists themselves, the Jiangsu Provincial Journalists' Association chose a spring to establish itself in Zhenjiang. Spring is a beautiful season, and it is also a day with sunshine. It symbolizes the future glory and heat. At this great founding meeting, it was decided to hold the first annual meeting in Wuxi on Journalists' Day "September 1." The location of the first Journalists' Annual Meeting was chosen in Wuxi, which is our honor and the honor of all Wuxi people.</p>
<p>It is estimated that there will be sixty representatives of member journalists from various counties coming to Wuxi this time. We used a pleading style to book forty rooms in the best hotel newly opened in Wuxi—the China Hotel. However, tense news came from Shanghai that colleagues in Shanghai were running for legislative and national assembly members, putting up a clear banner to "coincide with the event." We had to leave them a more comfortable residence closer to the representatives. However, we still don't know how many people will come from Shanghai, and there is no way to contact them. We hope that friends in Shanghai can get in touch. (Address: No. 16, Qianxixi, Wuxi, Preparatory Office, Chief Executive Sha Zhonghu)</p>
<p>On the night of Journalists' Day "September 1," there will be a grand moonlight garden party at Liyuan. Dinner will be on the large lawn of that country. Ideally: there will be a lively party scene, as well as a quiet tea house with ballad singing. After 10:30 PM, there will be a lake cruise and chat. There will be roving music performances on the lake. Because it is suitable for the mood under the moon, Chinese orchestral music will be used. Kunqu opera will be sung. What will be lively is the gongs and drums arranged in the distance. Although there will be a fierce wind and a general order, they will be in the distance, and it will not make the guests on the boat feel a little irritable. Close your eyes and think: what a fascinating situation this is! The moonlight on the lake, the faint green mountains on the lake, and a few friends chatting in the boat. What a lovely scene this is!</p>
<h3>An Occasional Thought on Journalists' Day</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiping</p>
<p>Celebrating Journalists' Day for the second time since the victory gives us in the profession spiritual comfort and encouragement, which is truly profound. As journalists, we bear a great mission: to promote culture and be the voice of the people. People even respectfully call us "Uncrowned Emperors." But how much of this can we actually achieve? We ourselves dare not say.</p>
<p>After twenty years as a journalist, I hope for a better next year, but next year is still unbearable! I recall a senior figure saying, "Things in China are always a mess." This is so true.</p>
<p>Looking back at the eight years of the War of Resistance, with arduous struggle, we adhered to national policy, opposed the "Peace Movement," and criticized the "Enemy and Puppets." Consequently, I was wanted by Wang Jingwei's government, leading me to live in seclusion, avoiding the dangers of those evil people, and losing my freedom. Thinking of those years of hard struggle, the pain still lingers!</p>
<p>The reality is such that no one can lose heart. We must fulfill our duties each day we are in our positions. Everyone should muster self-confidence, stand firm in determination, promote the cause of revival, and cooperate in national reconstruction. Personally, I hope to encourage myself, diligently research, and actively strive for progress.</p>
<h3>Collecting Bu Guang</h3>
<p>— Hesheng</p>
<p>Gui Bu Guang represents a typical figure among millions of journalists. Before the War of Resistance, he worked in Shanghai; after the war, he wandered battlefields, leading a very difficult life.</p>
<p>When I received news of him, he was working for a newspaper in Shaoyang, Hunan. When the Xiang-Gui campaign broke out, he followed the refugees in a wandering journey, eventually arriving in the wartime capital, Chongqing.</p>
<p>When he was in Shaoyang, we often corresponded. He worked hard there, but his spirits were not high. Some said he was love-struck and had some kind of nervous disorder. Later, he encountered a fire that burned all his luggage to ashes. One can imagine how bad his mood was at that time.</p>
<p>When he arrived in Chongqing, I saw his name on the refugee list. At that time, I was still in southern Jiangxi, and I had a deep understanding and sympathy for the wartime displacement he had suffered. Because I had personally experienced the chaos of the battlefield.</p>
<p>Soon after, I learned that he had joined a newspaper in Chongqing. I was happy for him, hoping that he could settle down and take a good breath for his long-weakened body.</p>
<p>However, this breathing space was so short-lived. Not long after, I received the sad news of his death in Chongqing!</p>
<p>Bu Guang, like all journalists, possessed the highest integrity in the pursuit of truth. He loved truth and beauty. He abhorred hypocrisy and supported justice.</p>
<p>He read a lot and was uncompromising on matters of right and wrong.</p>
<p>However, reality and fantasy are so far apart and hazy. Bu Guang traveled tens of thousands of miles, ultimately dying in poverty and illness at his post, unnoticed. His death is not discouraging to us, but a source of encouragement!</p>
<p>History always looks forward. Even in the afterlife, Bu Guang will surely point us in the direction to advance!</p>
<h3>Science to the Rescue from Poverty</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhengyu</p>
<p>Today's Chinese society is filled with discontent and unease—the good turning bad, and the bad turning worse. The state of the world and people's hearts is sigh-worthy! The historical residue left by thousands of years of stagnation under autocratic feudal politics has permeated our present-day thoughts, lives, and systems, causing us to deviate from a production-oriented basis. As a result, we appear poor and powerless.</p>
<p>Promoting science, developing culture, advancing production, and utilizing resources for the benefit of the people—we rely on these to build the nation and to shift the current superficial social atmosphere. We journalists should take this as our sacred duty, wielding our worn-out pens to instill in the people knowledge and concepts of scientific production.</p>
<h3>Soliloquy</h3>
<p>— Ting</p>
<p>On my own holiday, I would like to raise the issue of our (internal affairs reporters') health, because countless colleagues have suffered enough from poor health! From the perspective of our careers, we sacrifice the individual for the masses. From the perspective of our profession, we are all selling our health. We are engaged in the 361st occupation.</p>
<p>People in this profession (those who don't sleep at night), nineteen out of ten suffer from a very serious chronic illness—a gradual breakdown of the nervous system. But over time, they seem to have gradually become accustomed to it, not feeling pity for their own pale and gaunt faces, but rather self-deprecatingly comforting themselves, saying, "We're used to it, it doesn't matter." This is too pitiful!</p>
<p>Today, I don't have the energy to celebrate the festival. I only hope to regain my health. For example: that telegraph agencies can submit their evening drafts earlier, that newspaper offices can implement a rotating rest system, and pay more attention to the fitness equipment and activities of night workers. That would be a great virtue!</p>
<h3>The Hollow Title of "Uncrowned Emperor"</h3>
<p>— Zuo Xi</p>
<p>Before becoming a journalist, I envied the "honor and prestige" of the "Uncrowned Emperor." After becoming a journalist, I resented the hardship and poverty of my life every day.</p>
<p>I have a friend who has been in the news business for over 30 years, but all he has to show for it today is white hair and clean sleeves! Today, many journalists are still struggling under the heavy burden of life!</p>
<p>Just think: "Running around all day, working late into the night, from the first day of the year to New Year's Eve," a journalist's life, with often less than six hours of sleep and suffering from malnutrition, not to mention the hollow title of "Uncrowned Emperor," is probably worse than even the poorest teacher (of course, this is not a general statement). A few days ago, the day after Teachers' Day, there was reportedly a tragic incident of a group suicide among teachers. We certainly don't want the same tragedy to occur on Journalists' Day, but who can guarantee that such things will never happen?</p>
<p>Journalists' Day should be the most memorable festival for us. But writing a few commemorative articles and holding a celebratory meeting every year seems too boring and meaningless. If the "Uncrowned Emperors" could do something on this day each year to seek benefits for themselves and establish a long-term plan for future generations, wouldn't that be more meaningful?</p>
<p>I hope that the "Uncrowned Emperors" will have a day of "tiles turning over," at least no longer being part of the oppressed group in society!</p>
<h3>"Firsts" in Newspaper History</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>

<p>The first Chinese daily newspaper was the "Shanghai Xinbao," first published in November of the 11th year of the Xianfeng Emperor (December 1861).</p>
<p>The first English daily newspaper was the "Shanghai Daily Times," first published on August 11th of the 11th year of the Xianfeng Emperor (September 15th, 1861).</p>
<p>The first Chinese evening newspaper was the "Yebao," first published in the 8th year of the Guangxu Emperor (1882).</p>
<p>The first English evening newspaper was the "Evening Express," first published on September 4th of the 6th year of the Tongzhi Emperor (October 1st, 1867).</p>
<p>The first Chinese daily newspaper to use domestic telegraphic news was the "Shenbao," published on November 4th of the 7th year of the Guangxu Emperor (December 24th, 1881).</p>
<p>The first newspaper printed with a rotary press was the "Xinwenbao" in the early years of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>The first newspaper to have military correspondents was the "Shenbao," during the Sino-French War in the 10th year of the Guangxu Emperor.</p>
<p>The first newspaper written in colloquial language was the "Minbao," founded on March 5th of the 2nd year of the Guangxu Emperor (March 20th, 1876) and published by the "Shenbao."</p>
<p>The first newspaper printed with color plates was the "Shibao" on June 1st, 1927.</p>
<p>The first Chinese daily newspaper printed on white paper was the "Shanghai Xinbao" in 1861.</p>
<p>The first small-format newspaper was the "Youxibao," first published on June 24th of the 23rd year of the Guangxu Emperor (1897).</p>
<p>The first newspaper supplement was the "Tongwen Xiaoxianlu" of the "Tongwen Hubao."</p>
<p>The first pictorial magazine was the "Xiaohai Yuebao" published by the Shanghai Qingxin Shuguan.</p>
<p>The first modern pictorial magazine attached to a newspaper was the "Shibao Tuhua Zhoukan" in 1920.</p>

During the years of the Tongguang Emperor, there was also a "Records of East and West Oceans Each Month." Therefore, the "North China Herald" cannot be called the first.</p>
<p>Regarding the beginning of the first daily newspaper, the Chinese evening newspaper "Zhongwai Xinwen" was earlier than the "Shanghai Xinbao," during the 8th year of the Xianfeng Emperor, but it was initially published every two days, then daily, and was a supplement to the Hong Kong-based "Maici Bao." As for evening newspapers, it was earlier than the "Yebao."</p>
<p>The first official supplement was the "Ziyoutan" of the "Shenbao," founded in the 3rd year of the Xuantong Emperor.</p>

<h3>A Word of My Own</h3>
<p>Reporters are supposedly uncrowned kings, but I don't know who bestowed that title. I imagine it was an old saying from peaceful times. Now times have changed, and it's no longer a reliable description. As a reporter who is also a scholar, I naturally belong to the scholar class among scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants. In reality, due to the changing times, I have fallen to the bottom of the ladder.</p>
<p>Especially those of us who work on supplements, ranked as concubines, have even less to say.</p>
<p>I often hear a popular song with a line that says, "Nightlife is all for food, clothing, shelter, and transportation." It always sounds a bit harsh and suggestive, and one can imagine the meaning of life when one is often accompanied by knives, scissors, and paste under dim lights late at night.</p>
<p>However, when we receive many manuscripts from writers and letters from readers every night, we often feel a lot of intangible comfort, which is also a fact.</p>
<p>Life cannot be solely for food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, and there are many more things one can do for food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. Perhaps this is what Qu Yuan meant when he said, "I know that harm comes from chasing after things, but I cannot bear to give them up." Therefore, when faced with the choice between "speaking frankly and risking one's life?" or "following the crowd to get rich and live a cowardly life?", we ultimately chose the former. Of course, this is the only reason.</p>
<p>Logically speaking, the chaos of the times is abnormal, and the reversal of worldly affairs is a deformity. One day, there will be peace and clear distinctions between right and wrong, and truth will still be truth. As for our friends who edit supplements, if we can maintain this clean space in this era and provide readers with some clean spiritual food, then we can barely feel guilt-free; this is how we comfort and encourage ourselves.</p>
<p>On this Journalists' Day, I cannot remain silent, so I have hastily written a few words, which can be considered my own words. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the writers and readers. (Editor)</p>
<h3>In Memory of Venerable Master Hongyi</h3>
<p>— Kuang Ying</p>
<p>— Sixth Anniversary of His Passing</p>
<p>Six years have passed since Venerable Master Hongyi passed away. The precious raft sailed south, and sentient beings lost their reliance. Thinking about the emptiness of our country's art scene and the uneasiness of the literary world in recent years, one cannot help but think of this giant of the literary world.</p>
<p>Wu Zhihui once said, "Li Shutong could have been an artist, but he stubbornly chose to become a monk." Many people agree with Wu Lao's statement. Those who know Hongyi's life history believe that this man who had a strong interest and deep research in traditional Chinese painting, epigraphy, music, literature, and drama, who once ran a newspaper, engaged in revolutionary work, and was a romantic and unrestrained gentleman of the decadent world, unexpectedly became so passive in his middle age that he would enter the Buddhist gate. In the eyes of ordinary people, this is a mystery.</p>
<p>In fact, it is not easy to study and understand Hongyi's thoughts and life. After a person has tasted the most intense and complex life, he wants to return to simplicity. Originally, art is a weapon to reflect, express, and judge life, so the purpose of art is active. Hongyi was a person who had profound research in art. The reason why he was willing to give up his artistic life and turn to the dry and lonely life of the Buddhist scriptures was because the era he lived in was a chaotic society. Looking outward, there was social unrest; looking inward, there was family decline. His joining the Tongmenghui to engage in revolution was an expression of patriotic and angry enthusiasm. Later, his quiet departure from the world, turning from a revolutionary into a monastic life, was because time diluted his enthusiasm and he gained enlightenment from the Buddhist scriptures' teachings of "the impermanence of all beings" and "the emptiness of all forms."</p>
<p>Hongyi, in his youth, enjoyed the pleasures of the world, had a wife and two concubines, loved famous courtesans, indulged in opera singers, and befriended singers, which can be described as extremely romantic. But later, he was tonsured at Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou, and his wife and daughters could not even see him. What was the reason for this? Generally speaking, extreme enjoyment is often the prelude to extreme desolation. Extreme intensity leads to a longing for simplicity, and extreme happiness leads to sorrow. It can be said that it is human nature. At this time, everyone has the opportunity to realize the emptiness of life, but ordinary people cannot understand the emptiness of life. Intelligent people can often extricate themselves from the frenetic pace of life. Hongyi had a profound artistic cultivation, and the deeper his understanding of life, the deeper his understanding of life.</p>
<p>Today, it has been a full six years since the Master passed away in Zhangzhou, Fujian. In his later years, the Master loved the climate of southern Fujian, saying that he would grow old in this land. Earlier, the Master had a trip to Southeast Asia, but it did not happen because of the war. At that time, he wrote to his friends, expressing his willingness to sacrifice himself for his teachings in the face of the enemy's difficulties. Here is an excerpt from a letter: "To Layman Jianhun, I am pleased to hear of your well-being. I am infinitely grateful for your care. Because of the persuasion of Master Chuan Guan, my trip to the Philippines was postponed, thus avoiding the disaster. Otherwise, I would have been imprisoned in Gulangyu. But I have had the determination to sacrifice myself for my teachings in the face of the enemy's difficulties for four years, which I have mentioned to Master Chuan Guan and others. The ancient poem says, 'Do not dislike the old gardener's late autumn scenery, there is still the fragrance of late-blooming yellow flowers.' The later years are the most important in our lives, and I would like to encourage my colleagues to do the same."</p>
<p>From this letter, we can see the Master's steadfastness in dealing with the world, which is completely different from his romantic and unrestrained personality in his youth. Everything in the Master's youth was completely a "playful" behavior, like an unmoored boat, unrestrained and free. After becoming a monk, the Master was completely focused on "saving the world." Therefore, even writing and painting, he was afraid that it would hinder his spiritual practice, so he put down his pen and did not write. We speculate that the Master's subjective consciousness was that, as a revolutionary who saved the country and the people in his youth, he walked on the edge of society; and in his later years, with the spirit of "If I don't go to hell, who will?" he universally saved all beings. He was equally compassionate and sacrificing to save people, and there was no difference in the essence of his thoughts. When the Master became a monk, he only carried a shoe and a bowl, but his great ambition was to save all those who were suffering. Therefore, when he was seriously ill, he said, "After I pass away, I will come back on a precious raft, and all the事业 of saving sentient beings can be completed." At the same time, when he was in great pain, he still wrote the four large characters "Sorrow and Joy Intermingled," which shows the Master's great vow and his strict self-discipline, as well as the sorrow and joy at the time of his death. If not for a high monk, if not for a great vow, how could he do this?</p>
<p>The Master passed away in southern Fujian on September 1, 1942. The world has changed as before. Now the Master's grave has been built. Remembering this talented and versatile Master, I suddenly feel a sense of loss of reliance as the precious raft goes west.</p>
<h3>Poems from Beyond the Border</h3>
<p>— Li Qifeng</p>
<p>Dusk</p>
<p>On the ridge at dusk</p>
<p>An old traveler walked by</p>
<p>Unloaded his zither</p>
<p>Took off his camel bells</p>
<p>He said:</p>
<p>"I'm afraid the young people will feel lonely"</p>
<p>The Song of the Lily of the Valley</p>
<p>You are the flower blooming in my life</p>
<p>Enduring the torment of fierce winds and bitter rain</p>
<p>Someday:</p>
<p>I will truly be draped in blue sky and pillowed by green fields</p>
<p>I don't want your tears nor your song</p>
<p>I want you to leave your fragrance to the world</p>
<p>Accompanying me into oblivion</p>
<p>Afternoon at the Sickbed Window</p>
<p>Unshakable cicada song</p>
<p>Unbreakable idle sorrow</p>
<p>Under the sickbed window I think</p>
<p>Is the blue sky my hometown?</p>
<p>Why do the white clouds look so familiar to me</p>
<p>Unshakable cicada song</p>
<p>Unbreakable idle sorrow</p>
<p>Under the sickbed window I think</p>
<p>Is the green bamboo curtain my friend?</p>
<p>Why is the shadow of the tulip</p>
<p>Also so thin</p>
<p>The railing blocks out the loneliness of the earth</p>
<p>Leaving only white wisteria swaying in the west wind</p>
<p>Faintly reflecting a bunch of yellow flowers</p>
<p>The anxious footsteps of youth, ah!</p>
<p>The White Sandy Road</p>
<p>The White Cross</p>
<p>A woman in black wearing a veil wanders by again</p>
<p>Untitled</p>
<p>I love the blue sky as much as the stars</p>
<p>The blue sky is the desert in my heart</p>
<p>The stars are the little flowers in my heart</p>
<p>When lonely, I can't help but be helpless</p>
<p>"What is the taste of longing"?</p>
<p>In my dream</p>
<p>My love hesitates over the border</p>
<p>Braving the wind and sand</p>
<p>The Window</p>
<p>By the window</p>
<p>A child quietly listens</p>
<p>To the old one-legged cricket chirping</p>
<p>Hey</p>
<p>You shouldn't understand loneliness</p>
<p>A star falls in the southern sky</p>
<p>You smile lightly</p>

<h3>Additions and Subtractions to Poetry Lines</h3>
<p>— Zhu Wen</p>
<p>The Henan Shao Clan's Records of Things Heard and Seen states: In the Tang Dynasty, there was a person in charge of the imperial examinations who had a poem that said: "The plane tree leaves the shadow of the Luojing Pavilion, the vermilion doors of the examination hall are deeply closed. I have tasted the hardship of yesteryear, and I will not betray my original intention today." Later, a failed candidate adapted it into a five-character poem to mock him. This is from the Records of the Arashi Studio. Du Mu's Qingming poem: "During the Qingming Festival, the rain falls in torrents, the travelers on the road are desolate. May I ask where the tavern is? The shepherd boy points to Xinghua Village in the distance." Ye Pingyan's poem on the events of late spring: "Pairs of wrens walk on the desk, specks of willow catkins enter the inkstone. Sitting idly by the small window, reading the Book of Changes, I don't know how much of spring has passed." If you remove the first two characters from each character, they are all five-character quatrains. Li Bai's poem: "The forests and valleys before my robe gather the evening colors, the mist and haze on my sleeves collect the evening glow;" Wang Wei's poem: "Vast rice fields with flying white egrets, shady summer trees with singing golden orioles," by adding two characters each to Xie Lingyun and Li Jiayou's five-character lines, they feel refreshed and ancient.</p>

<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng 389</p>
<p>Old Long: "I say...everyone in the village! (This is read as Qing, which is not commonly used, but because the author thinks that Old Long is a [ ], his speech is very dramatic, so I simply made him dramatic to the end, borrowing two words to suit his fantasy. The actual title is "Head of the House")—I say...in terms of personality and ability, neither of us brothers is good enough, (personality is probably a mispronunciation of "qualifications"), neither of us brothers can decipher words, nor can we push around, ...but if you want to run errands, slaughter two chickens, get up at five in the morning, sleep in the middle of the night, walk south of the mountain, walk north of the mountain, and say a few words of foreign language (referring to Japanese and Russian), we brothers can still handle it. If you want to keep a secret, we are sealed jars, guaranteed not to let out a trace of air, exchange foreign currency for money, and play dumb, we can all do it. If you want to sell your life and charge into battle, we can do it without hesitation, with a ready pair of hands and two legs..."</p>
<p>These few words of Old Long seem to be nonsense, but all the conditions that Fan Yaoqun selects people can be summarized without omission. I wonder how he can be so thoughtful when speaking impromptu? Impossible. How can he be so on the subject? Probably he walked the inner line beforehand, a small inner line; that's why his speech had a draft.</p>
<p>There are probably more than just Old Long and Wu Rui who can donate their posts as captain and vice captain in the old village. In the eyes of Dragon Fifth Master and Yaoqun, there is at least a list of characters. But Yaoqun's most basic condition for selection is still the word "automatic"; she should not force a designation, which is the false truth; because everyone has their own ideals and difficulties. Old Long and Wu Rui are certainly qualified characters on the list, and now that he has volunteered, it is of course no problem to be selected.</p>
<p>Once the candidates for captain and vice captain are determined, the issue of other squad leaders and team members will be easily solved. As a result, the number of people willing to enter the pass exceeded the planned number by more than double. Old Long could not use special conditions to limit the number of people; everyone was qualified and everyone was friendly. What to do? Old Long is very smooth, he let everyone draw lots, "leave it to fate, take your chances" he divided the eighty-odd bamboo sticks into one, two, two kinds; all those who drew "one" were the first batch. Those who drew "two" were counted as the second batch, and after the first batch arrived at the destination, they would look at the situation and let the second batch listen for news in the old village. In this way, the problem of the number of team members was solved very fairly, and a reserve team was also stipulated incidentally.</p>
<p>After the entire team was determined, Yaoqun discussed official business with Old Long:</p>

<h3>A Wandering Young Girl (Reader's Mailbox)</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I am a twenty-five-year-old woman who has received higher education. My father is the manager of a bank, and my mother is a typical "well-bred lady." My parents only have one child, and I have been spoiled since I was a child. I can be considered a lucky person. But unfortunately, things finally arrived. When I was in college, I met a male classmate. His character, knowledge, and personality all matched the conditions of my ideal partner. We gradually moved from friendship into love.</p>
<p>My family is not new or old. My father is a student who studied abroad, but he still retains some "opposite" thoughts. My mother, on the other hand, is completely a "good person" who always obeys her father and never resists. She always takes a "hands-off" attitude towards her children's affairs.</p>
<p>Our love gradually matured, and of course, a young couple in love always hope to get married soon. But my father has always opposed my marriage. His reason is that my boyfriend is not a son of a "wealthy family" and does not have a Western-style house or a car. Of course, such a person is not worthy of being his son-in-law. Further opposition, he forbade us to communicate and interact with each other. At the same time, he began to find a "quick son-in-law" for me. At that time, I had left school and was working as a "number book clerk" in a primary school with a monthly salary of 220,000 yuan. My lover was just out of school and was working in a company.</p>
<p>As the days went by, my father's coercion became more and more intense, but I still struggled, and only struggle will lead to victory.</p>
<p>On an autumn night, my lover went north and was scheduled to leave the next day. I sneaked out of my house to get to the small room in the apartment where he was staying, and we spent the last night together passionately before parting. At the same time, I gave him the greatest guarantee—I dedicated my sacred virginity to him. My lover left me with a wounded but comforted heart and went to the distant north.</p>
<p>My difficulties finally came, and after a doctor's examination, it was confirmed that I was already a mother—the mother of a child.</p>
<p>In our family, this kind of incident is absolutely not allowed to happen, and my heart is filled with inexplicable terror. Abortion, running away, I can't solve my problem. Dear Editor, I hope you can give me some guidance. Xiu Yuan (Reply will be published tomorrow)</p>

<p>To Mr. Cheng Shengjun in Shanghai: Your illness is chronic bronchitis. As for what medicine you should take, please consult a doctor for a diagnosis and determination. This disease is not serious, but it is quite stubborn; it is difficult to cure if you do not remove the root cause. It is mostly caused by long-term inhalation of dust or irritating gases; people who like to smoke and drink are also often affected; in addition, there is what is called "occupational" bronchitis, which is common among workers such as grinders and textile workers. Strenuous exercise is definitely not advisable.</p>
