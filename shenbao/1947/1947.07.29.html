<p>〔合衆社南京廿八日電〕魏德邁一行今午十一時半返抵京，將在此間費去數日時間整理其所搜集得之情報，而其代表團國員，亦將召開個別會議，親自赴滬單獨進行調查。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕魏德邁一行返抵京後今午與司徒大使及蒲立德共餐於上海路寓邸，餐一後三人相談頗洽。魏氏旋稍事休息，並處理公務，下午八時偕一工程顧問德萊克賽爾海軍少將新聞顧問華生，赴張羣院長官邸一宴會司徒大使及傅涇波均應邀作陪。據華生語記者，渠等將於本週末或下週初離京飛靑，平，津一，瀋考察，長春及台灣之行將視情形及時間而定。至旅大等蘇軍駐區，目前尚未計劃前往。華生稱，中國幅員極大，而彼等行期忽促，調查難得遍及各地，亦不易處處深入，故其工作之進行方式，將先就自外得來之材料，歸納分晰，比較，研究，然後參以親聞實睹，作獨立之判斷。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕美大使館今發表書面聲明，公布魏德邁及其代表團一行於滬上作忙碌之二日停留後，已於二十八晨返抵南京。此二日間彼等曾獲得相當數量之資料，一部份得自中國之官員及工商人士（名單曾逐日刊於魏氏在滬臨時辦公處發佈之公報中），一部份爲美駐滬總領事戴維斯及其領館人員預爲準備之詳細報吿，一部份係在滬美商團體人士個人之報吿。該聲明稱：「尚有有價值之情報則自其他各方面繼續送交代表團，其中一項乃由熟悉中國各種問題之人士所遞交者，代表團中之某數團員，一將自動往訪此輩人土，另一項則一由各池區及各職業中之人士，出一一於自願及出於愛國熱忱，願對魏一德邁代表團供給其情報與建議者　。該聲明繼稱：「由於各項來源一之匯集，在魏德邁代表團來華之第一周中，己搜集得大宗情報。一魏德邁將軍及其顧問等，本週內將以大部時間從事於現有及繼續收到之資料報吿之比較研究。使館方面並再聲，明此際代表團一如過去，仍以調查事實爲主要目的。</p>

<h3>魏特使此來任務　係研究援華方式　張君勱訪晤魏使後談稱</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨主席張君勵於訪晤魏德邁將軍後，發表談話如下：「魏特使之言論態度，使人深感其友情洋溢，胸襟廓然，毫無成見，除希望往訪者提供資料及建議，並要求對美國現行之政策，予以坦率之批評。外傳魏使之來乃考察中國是否值得援助，必要時將支持日本以代替我國之說，本人在與魏使晤談之後，認爲此說完全不確。魏氏之來，實爲研究以何種方式，協助我國之復興最爲有效。至於本人向魏使貢獻之意見，除一般實際情形之外，大致如下，政治方面，主張澈底行憲，以改造政治，提高效率，目前政治效能之低落，並非人事問題，而爲整個制度問題。經濟方面，希望早日恢復穩定。軍事方面，本人主張軍事提高素質，重質而不重量。此點魏使頗有同感。」記者詢以改革地方政治之建議，中樞是否接受？張氏表示：「本人曾向政府建議提高省之權力，免得事事均需經過中央，公文施行，費時費力，此點已蒙主席同意，僅待實際推動。至於省主席由文人担任一點，本人原意並非謂凡屬軍人均不能任省主席，而係謂軍人之往地方長官者，以具有行政幹才及優秀幹部爲先決條件。關於普選之各黨比例，張氐承認三一一一大致己無問題，俟國民黨中常會通過後，即可正式公布」。</p>

<h3>征用私人國外存款　限於事實無法強制　盼國人自動申報聽候動用</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕滬美商認爲在美國貸款中國前，中國應先動用私人在美五億美元存款，以保證中國竭力自助。此間關係方面，二十八日評論此事時，首指出中國在復興過程中，雖有賴外國援助，然自始即未放棄自力更生意向。張院長蒞任伊始，即以此暗示國人，並正向此方面努力。</p>
<p>抗戰時即有意征借英美銀行未允所請</p>
<p>至動用私人在美存款一事，我政府於戰時即有意征借，並曾由財部擬具「征借人民外匯資產辦法」，由外部轉洽英美政府，請其協助。英國銀行界以銀行存戶姓名向不註明國籍，各戶存款數額對外應守秘密，披露存戶資產，違背信託，不免影響倫敦國際金融中心地位，堅持反對，美國方面亦復如是。嗣戰爭結束，英美政府先後宣布解除封存怯令，此事遂益無法辦理。本年二月經濟緊急措施辦怯頒布後，經再度向英美政府洽商，得英美駐華大使館本年三月十日及十四日函復，英美政府仍無法以存戶姓名奉吿。至美國政府前爲便於封存外人存款，曾一度於一九四一年調查各國存美資產，惟從未對外正式披露。我政府自無從得悉其詳情，且是項資料自美國宣佈解封後，必有變更，已無法利用。故政府現惟有希望人民自動申報財部，並會擬就「中華民國人民在國外外匯資產登記申報辦法」，政府發行美金債券，亦規定人民得以美金存款購置。其後並有人建議，在外存款在美購置機器，予以特別便利。此其目的皆在鼓勵私人動用在外存款，對國內建設能有所助益，即全國經委會最近所通過之經濟改革方案，亦規定「國人在國外資產應限期申報妥籌利用」，可見我政府對利用私人在美存款事，固無時不在注意中。此事一部份固須賴於國民之愛國心，然有賴於友邦協助者亦大。又外傳我私人在美存款達五億美金，據可靠方面估計，總數僅三億五千美元。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕卅六年度田糧會議開會期間，監院監委向乃祺·何漢文·王述會·白瑞·李正樂·馬耀南·石穎·兪奮·王子弦等，對田賦徽實問題建議三項改良辦怯。據稱：田賦徵實不在稅率之過重，而在於負擔之不均，尤其自辦理土地陳報後，因人謀之不臧及技術之拙劣，以致人民負擔輕者愈輕，重者愈軍，且輕者多係豪門巨室之大地主，重者多爲小地之自耕農及半自耕農之中下階層。故近年來，土地愈趨集中，喪失本業者日見加多，與平均地權及扶植百耕農政策背道而馳。渠等提出最低限度之改良辦法三項：（一）查湖南土地陳報，濱湖沃衍之區，其田土分爲三等九則起徽，邊療之區，其田土分爲兩等六則起徽，實寓有調劑盈虛之美意，然按之實際，沃衍各縣，甲上之田，每畝配賦，不過五角上下，以次遞減，合計三等九則所配之平均數，重者不過五角，輕者三角左右，而邊瘠各縣乙上之田，每畝有配賦至八角以上者，如沅陵是。其他各縣亦在七角以上，表面上雖免除甲等三則，然合計乙丙兩等六則所配平均數，重者在七角以上，輕者亦在六角左右。今爲平均縣與縣間之負担，凡田畝等則配賦平均數超過五角以上之縣，一律臧爲五角，依此核減總數，按照該縣等則重行分配起征。（二）我國田賦徽實，已將正供附加，合而爲一，以賦率每元折徽四斗計，約當純收入額百分之十五。今爲平均個人與個人間之負祖，凡人民納糧有超過其純收入額百分之二十者，得向田管處聲請核減至百分之十五，惟須聲明，除已編地段田號外，如發見尚有漏丈之田，除將漏丈者充公外，並甘受重罰，一面由田管處關查豪門巨室，如其所納賦額不足其純收入額百分之十者，得增加其田賦至百分之十五，並準一步調查其田產有無漏丈之處，其關查辦法另定之。。我國農業階段尚不能克服天然而爲天然力所支配，關於核定等則一事，其所課負担切不可超過土地生產力，未達到技術準確及評判公正以前，應本賞疑惟重，罰疑惟輕之原則，與其失之於重，寗可失之於輕，蓋藏富於民，其利終在國家也。</p>

<h3>社倫　對日貿易應有措置</h3>
<p>對日私人貿易開放問題，自監察委員萬燦等，提議政府暫緩開放，並主張停止派遣商務考察團赴日後，本報二十一日社評寄予共鳴，力述日本賠償問題未獲解決，對日和約未簽訂，遽然開放中日私人貿易，對於我國實利少害多。近日來，上海工商界一致主張，對日貿易之開放，應從緩議；免蹈戰前受經濟侵略之覆轍。國民參政員鄭揆一等提議，「請政府在未簽訂對日和約前暫緩開放對日貿易案」，薛明劍等提議「擬請政府暫緩開放對日貿易案」，經二十六日參政會駐委會全體審查會激辯成立，將兩案合併，決定辦法二項，送請政府辦理：（一）請政府在和約未簽訂前，暫緩開放對日私人貿易；（二）謀與日本臨時互通有無起見，可將過去已與日本進行之物物交換辦法，予以改善或擴充。我們認爲參政會的建議是正確的。八月十五之期轉瞬卽屆，政府應迅將決策宣示周知，以釋羣疑。</p>
<p>國際貿易，一如兩國的通常往來，在世界經濟繁榮發展的今天，國際貿易的活動，本無所謂贊成，也無所謂反對。關於對日貿易的開放，民間及工商界意見，是主張在時間上的保留，以待日本賠償確定，和約簽字，再行恢復正常的私人貿易關係。耳前過波時期，爲互通有無，中央信託局與日進行的物物交換，儘可放寬其貿易範團，改善或擴充其辦法，固不必待諸對日私人貿易之開放。參政員及工商界此項見解，具有遠識，於情於理，無可非議。蓋不論就任何方面着想，目前恢復中日私人貿易，僅屬日本片面利益，及這個少數商人的利益，對於國家民族實有害無利。我國問題已到政府抉擇的時際，主管對外貿易當局，應以國家利益及爲我國工業前途着想，不應作過於輕率的決定。</p>
<p>看日本報紙雜誌，片山政府及民間貿易組合，對於貿易開放，已擬具各種遠大計劃，並以業外貿易之恢復，爲日本產業復興之起點，更希翼由之取得美國十億大貸款，所謂戰敗國賠償義務，早已置之腦後，不問不議。尤其日本民間商人。聞麥帥總部八月十五日開放私人貿易後，莫不欣欣焉有喜色面相吿，彼輩正組織團體，準備於八月十五日後，往中國，走南洋，去台灣，到東北，在彼等之心目中，僉以復興之機會已到，日本東山再起的好運已臨。如果在這情勢下，我們遽行恢復中日私人貿易，不僅自投「工業日本農業中國」的陷阱，並將削弱我們在正式和會中的發言地位。果不幸走此一着，則我們抗戰八年，雖在戰塲上贏得了勝利，而在會塲上却遭遇了敗北，此關係我百年立國大計，民族正氣，與國際聲譽的大事，實不可不察，不可不慎！</p>
<p>所謂私人貿易，卽普通的自由的貿易，私人貿易的開放，卽自由貿易的恢復，這是關係一國經濟命脈活潑的大事。依一般慣例，私人貿易之恢復，應依據於通商條約，在平等互惠原則下，規定關稅稅則，商船活動，走私取歸，或匯兌比率等等，現在中日兩國處於無國交狀態，和約未簽訂，通商條約自無從訂立，實無從建立私人貿易。在此時際，如謀臨時的互通有無，兩國進行「物物交換」辦法，本係合理的過渡的辦法；惟如認爲必要，自然可以改善或擴充。所謂「物物交換」，係政府與政府間進行的貿易、此與普通的自由的私人貿易，性質殊異；且不受任何通商條約的拘束。我國自勝利以後，對日貿易，均以「物物交換」方式進行。從去年迄今，日本輸華的，計有礦木·枕木·人造絲·白報紙·火車頭等類，僅人造絲一項，一九三六年總值卽一，一八七，九六七·〇〇美元，今年一至五月總值爲一，五三八，四九八·一九美元：我國輸日的，計有食鹽·麥麩·生鐵·磷酸鹽等類，食鹽一項，一九三六年總值卽四，三四九，〇三二·五〇美元，今年一至五月總值爲一，七三二，四六五·〇〇美元。近來爲貿易的擴充，中央信託局與麥帥總部洽妥，本年對日輪出治糖總額爲二萬五千公噸，總值一五百餘美金；足徵中日物物交換政策，進行情况頗爲良好，且擴充了交換範圍。如果再擴充及改善物物交換範圍，相信日本賠償問題未確定，和約未簽訂前的中日貿易，亦並無扞格難行之處。我們希望政府，權衡利害輕直，接受民問意見，作此合理的賢明的措置，不可一味飲鴆止渴，更不可替劊子手磨刀宰殺自己的工業。</p>
<p>但對日貿易，遲早必恢復正常關係，所以我們希望政府和工商界，放大眼光，把握時機，於和會召開前，作各項充分的準備，無論研究調查，無論團體行動，均以爭取主動爲宜，始可立於不敗之地。尤其對南洋市塲，我們的貿易政策，應以此爲重點；時下有人主張修改國際貿易政第，也是值得考慮的事。總之，我們的貿易政策，應採取主動，尤其對日貿易，我們需要有準備有辦法的措置，切不可再蹈今天張皇失措，毫無應付措置的情况。</p>

<p>前天深夜，本市憲兵和警察在金都大戲院門前，因細故發生衝突，竟至使用機槍，造成市街上空前的血案，警士與市民的死傷，達十餘人。全上海的市民在報端看到這個驚人的消息時，對於比一不幸事件，無不表示十分痛惜，並希望立即依法解決。但警察竟有一部分於昨日休崗，幸賴義警及稽查大隊代行職務，否則全市的交通治安或將不免陷於紊亂的狀態，直至傍晚方始逐漸復崗。惟昨午金都大戲院內部設備突被搗毀，市民又無端受着意外的損失。我們對於這次不幸事件，有三點感想：</p>
<p>第一，不論是警察或是憲兵，都是代表國家維持地方秩序的，不僅其任務重大，而且其地位也，故應受人民的尊重。但是前夜發生的不幸事件，初意原欲替戲院維持秩序者，反而自身相互間妨礦了秩序，使人民受其驚惶。不論其起因如何，憲警發生衝突，並非追捕匪盜，而竟以機關槍在街上掃射，如臨大敵，終是一些尊重法治的人民所不願看見的現象。事後警憲當局研究起事的原因，據傳乃由於警憲事權未劃分淸楚所致，若果所傳不處，此事自應靜待中樞依怯處理，任何一方不應再有所舉動，使市民蒙受意外的損失。所以我們要爲市民　請休崗的警士們，深明職責之所在，尤應以地方洽安與交通秩序爲重，今日完全恢復常態，各守其崗位。</p>
<p>第二，勝利以遠，上海治安與秩序的維持，都靠了警察官同的努力。本市各界春節與端陽節兩次慰勞，雖為數不多，但也足以表示市民對於警憲的感激之情。不論警憲之間　限如何求其割分，感情如何求其融洽，而要以尊軍法紀維護秩序為第一義，顧及人民的安全，尤其是他們一切工作的總目標。地方事件，中央和地方的主管長官，確有儘速責任，依法處理的必要。而無幕人民所受的意外損害，政府更應負責的予賠償</p>
<p>第三，上海為中國最大的商埠，中外觀瞻所緊，無論政府與人民，他們的一舉一動，在足以影響中國的聲譽國際地位。前晚的不幸事件，不能不說是上海的污點之一。我們往常呼蔽秩序與法紀，政府也要大家遵守秩序與法紀，而現象乃如此！，然平心而論，所以形成此種現象者，似非一朝一夕之故，亦非警憲所獨有。試縱目四顧，社會上每天妨碍秩序破壞法紀的事實，不知其多少。長此下云，幾將令人有「不守秩序為經常，尊重法紀為例外」之感，此與大可優慮之事。所以我們願不避逆耳，大聲疾呼，呼蔽政府與社會舉一反三，大家徹底反省，恪守秩序，尊重法紀。一切是非曲直，悉應在漢律前作公正無私的判斷！</p>

<h3>美刷新外交陣容　以備對蘇聯進行外交戰</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿七日合衆電〕美刻擬與蘇聯展開爭取和平之外交戰。馬歇爾國務鄉刻正從事整頓美外交陣容，取消　預無能之官員。因政治性質而被任命者。爲數之少爲空前所未有。外交官被任命者。悉爲曾服務於世界各重要地方之職業外交家。美國將在巴爾幹半島，中歐及瑞典等地方，佈有歷史上最強之外交網。中東方而，美外交陣容業已加彊。中法兩國方而，不久將略有重變。馬帥係以舊日之戰術，解決此問題者。渠企求以最具才幹之戰地司令官，以環繞蘇聯聯。此工作尚未完成，然已在進行中。</p>
<p>據合衆社調查結果，現任美國大使公使等之年齡，實皎近來任何階段爲輕。馬師於國務院內所進行之工作，亦有兩項與其對國外美國外交陣容所展開者相同，此則（一）國務院內高級官員之遴選工作，則吿完畢，其中大都爲職業外交家；（二）改組國務院，合併各秘書處，統一情報工作，設置擬定長期計劃人員。馬氏使一般職業外交家不再有所不安，彼等前曾認爲馬帥可能任用舊日作戰同胞，以任高級外交官也。依據合衆社統計，美國駐西半球國家之大使及公使，共達六十四人，中東方面歐洲方面廿四人，中東及非洲方面十二人，遠東及太平洋方面七人。目前空額有四。即冰洲，西班牙，保加利亞，及尼加拉瓜。大使及公使中，職業外交家共達八十六人，因政治關係而任命者十三人，軍人之被任命者四人，非職業外交家然具有特殊資格者六人，非職業外交家中有數人尚係故羅斯福總統所任命者。新任之非　業外交家，但且有特別資格，工作頗爲艱重者，係駐英大使陶格拉斯，駐印大使格拉第，及駐波大使格利非斯。馬帥注重歐洲所有美國使節之職位，尤其駐在蘇聯四週之鄰邦者　。渠刻需要第一流之外交家，出使瑞典，蓋瑞典雖甚安謐，然日前實乃探測蘇聯最佳之地方。馬帥刻復加強柏林方面之美國外交陣容。至於巴爾幹半島方面，聯合國問題專家狄農已出任駐南斯拉夫大使。前任美國務院外交事務局局長傑英方抵匈牙利，前任匈牙利公使許恩非德則調往羅馬尼亞，僅保加利亞方面尚無美國高級外交官員。瑞士方面亦將由前國務院遠東司司長蕩宣德繼任公使，范氏雖以大部份時間致力於遠東問題，然一股認爲渠乃美外交人員中目光最銳利最爲幹練之人才之一。</p>
<h3>福萊斯特籌劃　陸海空軍合併</h3>

<h3>英蘇貿易談判卒告失敗　蘇政府闡明立塲　謂英方態度強硬造成破裂局面</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿七日電〕塔斯通訊社頃發表官方公報，說明英蘇商務談判破裂原因，略謂：英蘇商務談判破裂，實應由英國之「強硬」能度負其責任，談判之中止，其原因有二：</p>
<p>（一）英國不願負袒肯定之義務，以鐵路路軌，火車及其他工業產品供給蘇聯，蘇聯旣不知英國將否履行義務，自不願對英國負担任何義務。（二）蘇聯要求將英國於一九一四年貸與蘇聯款項之消費稅減少百分之〇·二，並要求在十五年內分期償還，此即蘇聯要求取得英國最近給予法國之同樣便利之謂，但英國代表團表示拒絕。旋蘇聯爲希望獲致協議起見，乃放棄其分期還款之要求，僅要求英國准許蘇聯先將半數立即付淸，餘數則在若干時期內償付，英國代表團又表示不能接受，並提出對案，生張四分之一之數分期償付。蘇聯政府對此，殊難接受。外國通訊社於本月廿四日發出消息謂，英蘇商務談判破裂，係由於對於小麥價格意見不同所致，此說並非事賓，英蘇雙方對於小麥價格業已獲致協議，此項價格較諸英國最近向阿根廷購買之小麥價格以及加拿大之小麥市價均低云。</p>
<p>英方見解一斑</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社偷敦廿七日電〕關於蘇聯指斥英蘇商務談判失敗係由於英國態度強硬所致一事，英國官方人士均迄未加以評論，但據有資格之人士稱：英蘇商務談判之失敗乃爲蘇聯拒絕參加馬歇爾援歐計劃之後果，蘇聯旣拒絕馬歇爾國務卿之建議，自不得不將其可以出口之剩餘貨物輸往東歐各國。自蘇聯決定不參加馬歇爾援歐計劃之後，蘇聯所提之小麥價格以及其要求英國供　之各種工業設備之性質，均有顯著之轉變，談判之失敗，在當時似已不可避免。</p>
<h3>馬卿獲自由獎</h3>

<h3>澳外長再唔麥帥　對日各項問題意見歧異</h3>

<h3>法國左右兩派　面臨實力考騐　戴高樂公開譴責共黨</h3>
<p>〔路透社法國萊納城廿七日電〕怯國人民團結運動領袖戴高樂將軍，於其建立強力民主政府與美全力合作之運動中，今復又更進一步，正面攻擊法國共黨。政界人士相信，戴氏之逐漸更公開地與怯共處於對立地位，與蘇聯之拒絕參加馬歇爾援歐計劃討論，不無有關。戴氏率直稱蘇聯之政策令人驚詫，渦去七十二小時來，法國領袖之發出類似驚異呼聲者，戴氏己爲第三人。法前總理雷諾於星期五曾提出警吿，謂「不久發生戰爭」與「美蘇妥協」之決擇爲時已不遠。法外長皮杜爾昨日亦稱，國際局勢已屆嚴重階段，法國人民普遍相信國際局勢目前已充滿危險性，國民議會之並不按例於夏季休假，可證此說。戴高樂之嚴辭譴責共黨及蘇聯之稱霸，而同時則呼籲一切法國人民，包括「迄至目前爲止聽命於他人之人」在內，預示法國內部已將屆分裂之局面，而傾東傾西兩派不久亦將從事實力之試騐。此項內爭，因經濟財政狀况之日趨惡化，將加速爆發。戴高樂此次遊歷勃萊泰果省已轟動遠近，有不遠三百哩而來聆聽其演說者，可見此一戰時領袖猶深得人民之擁戴。</p>
<p>戴高樂演辭內容</p>
<p>〔聯合社法國萊納廿七日電〕戴高樂今日在此發表演說，指責蘇聯造成世界危局，並責法國共產唯莫斯科之馬首是瞻。戴氏稱，蘇聯已控制隣近西班牙，土耳其及義大利各國人民四萬萬，距法國不過五百公里而已，蘇聯以其軍事及經濟壓力，與各國內部人員策在應，已波蘭，南斯拉夫，阿爾巴尼亞，羅馬尼亞，匈牙利，保加利亞，普魯士及薩克松尼組織極權政體，且能操縱捷克及芬蘭云。</p>

<h3>蘇科學家發現　新磁北極</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十八日電〕據管理北極探險與航行之蘇聯北海航綫管理局公布，蘇聯科學家已發現一一人跡不能到達之極地」，且加以研究，並又證實第二磁極之存在。「人跡不能到達之極地」爲加拿大探險家斯旦芬森之定名，該地不受星體與地磁之影響，爲距離任何居民地最遠之地區，亦爲自北極各地最難到達之地區。</p>
<p>劍橋大學極地研究所發言人稱，該地或在北緯八十五度左右，以及東經一百三十度西經一百四十度之間。蘇聯科學家並未精確指明該極之地位，惟稱，一九四一年曾派探險隊至該地。據探測所得「人跡不能到達之極地」，海底深達六千呎至一萬一千呎，而非前所假定之二萬一千三百四十呎。在大冰島之間有小說塊與流水。此與以前之假定相符合者。許多探險家曾經過該「人跡不能到達之極地」，然至今僅有蘇聯隊會在流動之冰島上勾紫數月，作科學考察。同時蘇聯科學家聲稱，第二磁極之存在亦已證實，然亦未曾宣佈其精確之地位。</p>
<h3>杜魯門總統喪母　蔣主席特電致唁</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕美總統杜魯門太夫人廿六日病逝後，蔣主席聞耗已馳電杜魯門致唁，原電譯文如下：「驚悉太夫人逝世，敬致唁忱」。</p>
<p>〔合衆社密蘇里州大觀城廿七日電〕杜褂門總統太夫人享年九十四歲逝世後，將於今日下午三時出殯，由大觀城沒禮會牧師鮑曼主持，在坎蕯斯城之森林山公墓奉行葬禮。</p>
<h3>共和黨控制下的美國會動態</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿七日電〕美國第八十屆國會今日已結束其第一次會議。此次會議中國會對於外交事項之所爲雖屬平平，然其確已使共和黨保守份子及根深蒂固之孤立主義者驚訝不止矣。最近十六年來首次得能控制國會之共和黨議員，雖能自杜魯門所提大部係屬國內費用之爲數三百七十億美元之澦算案中削去約二十七億美元之數，然事實上爲美國對外方案之所有要求均獲批准。</p>
<p>美國兩黨外交政策或無黨派外交政策，在此次會議中繼續增加實力。共和黨諸領袖綱續促使美國在世界事務方面採取一更爲積極之任務。杜魯門政策及馬歇爾所提之歐洲經濟復興計劃，已成爲美國外交政策之基石。雖則有共和黨政策及孤立派等因素之存在，美國會之動向繼續贊成將美國之金錢化費於海外，以加強民主力量。然國會方面曾竭力使美國援助務必附有條件，并減少杜魯門所欲作之任何諾言。</p>
<p>美國會在過去七閱月來在共和黨之控制下，已表現漸次懷疑蘇聯，尤以馬歇爾自莫斯科會議歸來後爲然。同時表現對國內外共產主義之恐懼。杜魯門要求國會撥款四億美元以制止共產主義在希臘土耳其之蔓延，曾自國會議員方面立即獲得響應，在美總統所提之忠實方案下，爲劃除美國共產黨所需之一千一百萬美元，亦未經若干困難即吿獲得。國會方面人士在戰後世界思想上繼續表現有若千進步。</p>
<p>國會刻對馬歇爾所訂關於保特堅決而謙恭之態度，并不論蘇聯是否參加，將猛力推進戰後世界建設工作之政策，已決予以即時之支持。國會雖拒絕換受大量歐洲流亡人民分四年時期進入美國，但撥款七千五百萬美元緩和歐洲之需要。</p>
<p>美國務院全部提案是有一半均被接受，然其所遭受之最嚴重打擊無過於國會拒絕馬歇爾所提實現永久基礎之政府海外情報工作之要求，國會僅准以一千二百萬美元撥充對外廣播宣傳計劃經費。據國會紀錄表示，美國於過去二年曾以近二百億美元接濟全球五十九國。</p>
<p>國會之另一引人注意之事實即其對歐洲問題之絕大開心，而對中國大問題一無加以討論或作決定。</p>
<p>國會下屆會議對馬歇爾計劃之大辯論，將取決於歐洲之發展。國際局勢如轉趨危急，國會可能於一月前復會。下屆會議所將面臨之最大國外問題，仍爲對蘇聯，刻正逐漸意識世界己分裂爲蘇聯與西方民主國家之兩範圍。</p>
<p>下屆國會對將於八月十五日在里約熱內盧會議上討論泛美軍備標準化及合作之計劃，亦將作決定。鑒於國會之反共趨向，西半球防衛計劃殆將可不經任何修改而通過。</p>
<h3>英經濟危機嚴重　竟有人撰文主張艾德禮辭職者　英首相將報告執政經過</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿八日電〕博護社會定義之「每日鏡報」今日撰論，要求艾德禮首相引咎辭職，據稱，如不自動退位，國會大部份議員必將泊其下野。於斯可見英國經濟危機日益增加，一般人士深感不安。同時，自共黨以迄保守黨各種政治傾向之報紙，均對內閣實施抨擊，僅自由黨「每日前鋒報」例外，但亦非如往昔之衛護政府。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿七日電〕K艾德禮首相應工黨議員之請，定於星期三向工黨議員特別秘密會議致詞，報吿領導國事之經過情形。各報今日成以大字標題揭載各黨頒袖之警吿，謂英國煤荒及其他必需品匱乏，仍極嚴重，除非發現奇續，英國匪特在今冬甚或在此後數年尚須受飢寒之苦。國外方而英國勢力旣已退出印度，緬甸及希臘，此後更須減少兵力及其他負擔。</p>
<h3>朝鮮臨時政府組織問題　美不贊同蘇建議　韓北難民紛紛逃入美佔領區</h3>
<p>〔合衆社漢城廿八日電〕據勃朗將軍稱：美蘇混合委員會由於蘇方反對將所謂反託管委員會之過去會員，包括於臨時政府之內，己發生若干困難。美國代表不能同意取消合作宣言，其結果將否認代表朝鮮輿論之一部分市要人士。勃朗繼稱，美國代表團之意見，認爲政府乃屬於人民者，此意即謂政府屬於一切人民及一切由人民組成之政黨，否認大宗人民及代表人民之各政黨，無權參加渠等生活中所遭逢最重要之事，即不令其參加渠等政府之產生，將爲不合正義之事，此乃美國代表團所不能同意者也。</p>
<p>〔合衆社漢城廿八日電〕日境諸美軍司令曾謂。朝鮮乃東方之多事地點，記者於抵達漢城後，始明其理，蓋共產份子即將在美佔領區內發動革命。果爾，則美佔領軍勢將與共產份子發生戰事，結果莫可逆料。美佔領軍司令霍琪中將所以不頤携帶眷屬赴任，及屢吿部下切勿如此者，其故即在於此。簡言之，朝鮮問題乃如將朝鮮歸還韓人自理，而不致成爲蘇聯之附庸。蓋美蘇分別佔領朝鮮南北後，對於刺鮮間題從未獲致協議而鳳陷僵局。傳蘇聯已將韓北組織成爲蘇聯之附庸，且已派遺數千名久經訓練之共產份子混入美革佔頒區，俾聯合此間之二萬名同志協力煽動事變。此外，蘇軍佔領區內且每日有「難民」逃入此間，現美軍當局認偽此輩頗有煽動革命之虞。</p>
<h3>伊爾根黨籲請猶太人　發動不服從運動　英軍繼續攔陰猶移民船</h3>

<p>〔路透社海發廿八日電〕猶太難民船「歸家」號載無照猶太移民四百名已駛近海發港，英第六傘兵師裝甲車一隊特在海發街頭巡邏。海發卡美爾山猶太區已實行封鎖，戒備之英兵奉令準備應付隨時事變。據猶太方面息：另一猶太難民船「被害人號」載猶人七百名，正隨「歸家」號之後鼓棹駛來巴勒斯坦。官方宣布兩船之難民均將被遣往塞浦魯斯島。官方對海軍　截該兩船之情形，嚴守秘密。</p>

<h3>中央憲警大員來滬　澈查金都血案責任　軍警憲組織調查會共同進行處理　警察休崗午後局部恢復</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕金都大戲院憲警衝突流血案發生後，警備司令部極爲重視，昨晨十時，宣司令會同警察局長兪叔平·副局長張師·督察長張達等親至新成分局勸導警員勿作過激行動，恢復工作。同時爲調査事實眞相，防止事態擴大起見，由警備司令部警察局憲兵團三方面組織調査委員會，警備部派稽査處長陶一珊·警察局派副局長張師·憲兵團吳團長光運·三人於中午十二時半在陶一珊私邸作初步會商，決定以不使事件擴大爲原則，調査眞相秉公辦理。三方面並各派幹員兩人，作進一步之調査，以判明責任誰屬。肇事之憲兵排長李豫泰及其他有關憲兵已由憲兵廿三團予以扣押，血案中傷亡之警察則將優予撫卹。宣司令因本案關係重大，爲求公平判斷，已電請國防部派大員來滬主持解決。</p>
<p>據宣司令發表談話稱：渠現尚未交代警察局長之兼職，故即使公正處理此事，亦難免又謂有所偏袒，故特呈請國防部與憲兵司令部迅派高級職員來滬調査處理。兪局畏叔平亦已電請警察總署派員來滬。現悉，憲兵司令部與警察總署方面已谷派出大員，業於二十八日晚乘車離京，可於二十九日晨到滬，將會同上海方面共同進行調査，再研究一處理辦法，以求圓滿解決。</p>
<p>警察方面昨晨情緒頗爲激動，形成罷崗之情勢，並有少數擁至金都大戲院，將戲院內部設備搗毀。宣司令於上午至新成分局訓話後，兪叔平局長亦竭力勸導制止。下午二時吳市長由張師副局長陪同至新成分局再向警員勸論，以維持秩序爲重。同時南京內政部方面聞悉此事，亦急電市政府速謀　崗，下午三時後各道路崗位已陸續局部恢復。警備司令部爲維持治安，防止奸宄乘機活動，所屬九個稽査大隊及義務稽査第一第二大隊均全部出動，巡邏要區。各馬路交通則由總局派警官及義務警察維持。</p>
<p>憲兵團發表起衝突經過</p>
<p>憲兵廿三團方面對於此次衝突情形，昨曾分函各報館，發表血案經過如下：「前夜十時許，康定路憲兵隊第八連憲兵巡查組六人，奉令至金都大戲院巡査軍人風紀，因觀客購票與金都職員發生爭執，該組憲兵上前調解，而與六五八八號警士發生誤會。另有該連排長李豫泰率領之另一巡査組亦至金都巡査，李與該警士由口角而互毆，其他憲兵乃以槍柄擊該警士。此時憲兵警務團本部警務處陳範偕六士兵經金都，見狀乃上前調解。六五八八號警士稱身受重傷，然陳營附親自騐看並未有如何車傷。當時陳以電話通知新成分局長卓淸寶，並允將六五八八號警士送至醫院醫療，由憲兵負組醫藥費。卓分局長即表示同意，並保證事件不擴大。十分鍍後，車分局長派顧課員至金都，經雙方討論後，事件已吿解決。</p>
<p>徒手警士包團</p>
<p>不料當排長李豫泰出金都時，即爲一百餘便衣之徒手警士所包圍，李等乃退至金都三樓，並以电話通知連本部及新成分局長。未幾，連部即由王連長與新成分局夏副分局長趕至金都，惟仍未能解決。此時夏副分局長及憲兵均至金都三樓，而不意剛有開納路憲兵隊動務組之憲兵一卡車，由東往西，百餘警士因誤會上前包圍卡車，卓上憲兵因百餘警士未穿制服，見勢立即從車躍下，臥倒於地。車上連長任亞夫，經問明後，始愁事件之眞相。此時己經相近十一時，適有滿載西瓜之卡車一輛，由西往東駛去，警士阻止該車前進未果，槍聲即於此時開始。第一槍彈適打中美憲兵聯合巡査隊之白色吉普車。車上美憲兵兩名及我憲兵立即躍下臥倒，槍聲即漸趨密。」</p>
<p>第一槍之謎</p>
<p>故憲兵團方面認爲應公正調査何方先發第一槍而造成大規模衝突。但據警察局副局長張師稱：該局已派警衛處長陸大公至中美憲兵隊調査並無其事，且在出事地點檢獲之彈壳均係步槍彈及湯妣生槍彈。現責任究應誰屬，已由調査小組嚴密偵査中。</p>
<p>警厂槍械有册可查</p>
<p>據新成警分局畏卓淸寶談：「如謂警察首先開槍，實屬非是，蓋警察出勤所領槍械，在落差時必須向槍械間繳還，即使開放一彈，亦須據實報銷。局內所有槍械子彈，均有淸册可査。」又謂：「此次所檢獲之子彈壳數十粒，均係湯姆生式，木光槍及「三八式」步槍所放出。至警局所有者則均爲三八式手槍」云云。</p>
<h3>憲兵副團長表示　指便衣警有槍械</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕憲兵廿三團副團長劉從龍對警局方面所稱各便衣警員均未携帶槍支一節，作如下三點表示：（一）便衣警赴金都旣無任務，無須出動二百餘人。（二）該團檢獲白朗寗子彈壳六枚，該團無此等槍枝。（三）天明時，曾發現各便衣警均係備有槍枝者。又當零時三十分左右，美海軍憲兵帕力爾駕吉普車自西駛來，爲便警喝令停止’該美憲兵予理會，即有槍聲兩響自後發出，一槍中吉普車玻璃板。此後，四下即槍聲大作。該美憲兵廿八日曾赴憲兵團談話，作成筆錄，證明該車所中之槍彈，爲白如寗平槍所發，並證明爲便衣警所發云。</p>

<h3>黃首檢表示　無任何意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨日　夜訪本市地方法院首席檢察官黃亮，叩詢地檢處對此次金都血案態度。據稱：地檢處對該案尚未接獲任何報告，僅於報端略有所知，憲兵係現役軍人，非法院管轄，警察則係市政府公務人員，如其有不法越軌行動，或有被害人來狀吿訴，地檢處當然受理，依法律程序偵査。至於此案本人目前尚無任何意見。</p>

<h3>交通無人指揮　汽車竟成牛步</h3>
<p>街頭巷尾資為助談</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕福煦路同孚路一帶商店居民，前夜飽受驚擾，餘悸猶在。昨每見軍警經過，競相走避，附近一帶商店，整日皆未開門營業，居民均以此案爲談話資料，議論紛紛，他如西瓜攤販，汽水小販，現身說法，講述目擊經過，繪聲繪色，路人多爲駐足。穿黃色制服之軍警，雖不時在街頭及金都戲院出現，但十字路口交通，無人指揮，車輛來往，爭先恐後，秩序頗呈紊亂。同時全市交通亦因無崗警指揮，陷於混亂狀態，道路阻塞，汽車成爲牛步。大有「行不得也哥哥」之慨。</p>

<h3>金都三度遭搗毀　工程師下落不明　影院公會發表書面聲明</h3>
<p>（本報訊）電影院同業公會爲金都大戲院昨日被搗毀事件，特發表書面聲明，原文云。「據金都大戲院報稱：該院於本月廿七日晚九時半許有觀客三人持戲劵二張，擬入院觀劇，經收票員加以婉阻，致起爭執，當由在塲出勤憲兵排解，時有另一警員在院亦趨排解，不知因何故發生誤會，繼起毆打，該警員即悻悻而去，該院方慶無事，未幾忽有大隊警員來院，聲勢汹濤，該院以適售滿座，爲求千餘觀客之安全起見，故將鐵門拉閉，以資隔離，是亦爲各院每次避免發生事端保護觀客安全之惟一辦法。當時院外人聲沸雜，愈聚愈衆，軍警平民無法辨別，僵持至十二時半許，忽起槍聲，時停時續，直至二時半許，幸經各主管首長到達，事趨平靜，是非曲直，業由負責當局分別調査，不久當可判明。詎知於本日（廿八日）上午十一時許及下午一時許，四時半許，該院被警察數十名分乘卡車橫施搗毀，在院職工均遭凶毆，並架走來院査檢冷氣機械之工程師一名，迄今下落不明，所有生財搗毀殆盡。査該院以憲警執勤衝突而遭受無妄之災，曷深痛亟，本會爲求同業之生存觀衆之安全，是當繼請懲兇。又於同日下午復有警員數十人乘坐卡車分赴各院令將原設憲兵席撤去、幸經各院處理得宜，未有事端發生。本會以此次不幸事件其肇事之主因全在警憲動務劃分不明所致，於兪警局長談話中業已詳述無遺，孰是孰非未敢斷言，然本日金都三次遭受搗毀，誠令同業不寒而慄，故除要求當局予以切實之保障賠償金都所受全部損害外，並要求迅行懲處肇事凶犯，採取有效之辦法，不再發生同樣事端，否則本會會員爲求觀衆之安全，本身之生存，將被迫而全部停業。」</p>
<p>設備毀損迨盡　膠片作蝴蝶飛</p>
<p>又據電影院商業公會方面消息：據該會所接得之報告，金都昨被搗毀數次，其最後一次至四時半始離去。後由警備部派隊守衛，始歸平靜。惟斯時院內所有設備，亦己毀損迨盡，即院外之大玻璃窗，霓虹燈，及「龍鳳花燭」之廣吿一對大花燭亦未能倖免。當被搗之際，「龍鳳花燭」之全部膠片，曾被陸續自窗中擲入街心，路人爭相拾觀，一度造成極混亂之狀態。屋頂復有人將積存之柴爿自高空擲下，致霓虹燈均遭「粉身碎骨」之禍。</p>
<p>茶房越屋逃出</p>
<p>當時曾有茶房三人，翻越屋頂逃出，但有職員曾廷杰及請願警兪乃淼二人，則吿失踪。又前夜發生紏紛時，院方當事人稽査張鏞根現己山警察總局傳往偵訊。故當時之是非問題，他人殊難猜測。該院經理柳和淸，今晨十時許前住稽査第一大隊報吿經過、迄晚猶留隊候訊中。</p>
<p>金都損失詳細情形，因事後無人敢入內詳細調査，故實際上尚難統計。惟據戲院中人談：如全部被毀，則損失之數約在四五十億之間。</p>

<h3>杭教次昨招待本市記者　闡述整理交大意義</h3>
<p>交大整理委會昨決議：本「公平」「寬大」「迅速」三原則，在一個月以內整理完畢，產生新校長。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕交通大學自校長吳保豐辭職照准後，即由教育部組織整理委員會，委員共九人，內教育部職員三人，計教育部次長杭立武，參事相菊潭，但蔭蓀；校友會方面五人，計北洋工學院院長茅以昇（兼委員會秘書），上海市公用局局長趙曾珏，上海市工務局局長趙祖康，中央研究院工程研究所所長周仁，國立吳淞商船專科學校校長周均時；另一人則爲上海市教育局局長顧毓誘。由杭次長擔任主任委員。昨晨九時，該整理委員會在中央研究院舉行第一次會議，決議本「公平」「寬大」「迅速」三原則，在一個月以內整理完畢，產生新校長。另聘校內教職員九人，組織校務委員會，負現理現今校內日常事務，並執行整理委員會之決議。至該校務委員九人人選尚待接洽，日內即可決定。並決定俟新校長發表後，整理委員會即吿結東。又杭次長因部務待理，不克長期駐滬，在離滬期間，主任委員職，由兼秘書茅以昇代理。</p>
<p>整理工作　積極性重於消極性</p>
<p>昨日下午五時，杭次長立武會同茅以昇趙曾珏兩氐，於中央研究院招待各報記者，席間杭次長談稱：我國於一八四〇年以後，因受外國強權之壓迫，乃感覺有賴新教育以振作強盛之必要，惟當時係以方言教育及武備教育爲重。直至一八九五年中日戰事發生後，乃感覺欲強盛，非僅賴方言與武備教育即可，乃興辦實科教育，創立北洋大昌與南洋大學。後南洋大學演變而爲交通大學，故交大在我國近代教育史上，實爲國內實科教育之開始。至今已具有五十年以上之歷史，經多人經營，學風素極淳篤，學術水準亦高。歷屆畢業學生對國家交通建設貢獻至大。惟復員以來，學校風紀因少數學生之煽動，日見廢弛。</p>
<p>以上學期爲尤甚。實際上課僅六星期，學期踝業無法結束。最近著假期內，復有校外學生數百人，混入校內居住，組織團體，發行刊物，踰越常軌，校方無怯行使職權。學生家長與社會人士嘆有煩言，即校內師長及優良學生亦深感有改善之必要。吳校長保豐四次請辭，教育部不得已准其辭職。在新校長未發表前，並特組織整理委員會負責整頓。本「公平」「寬大」「迅速」三頃原則，謀積極之改進，作有效之措施，以期早日恢復常態，保持過去聲譽。該項整理工作積極性重於消極性。其目的在愛護交大過去膝史，使將來更有發展。相信現任教職員爲愛護學校，必能合作、共渡難關。而大部份學生，平時優良者，亦不必懷疑恐懼。此項整理工作，不會搖動交大本身基礎，但如對學校前途發展有礙者，則予去除。目前整理委員會，係在淸理一條路，使新校長接任後，能有發展，俾使交大成爲國內交通工程之最高學府。</p>
<p>整理委員　將來不致出任校長</p>
<p>繼茅以昇氏談稱：整理委員會係吳校長辭職後，與新校長尚未發表前之過渡組識，其任務在維持與改善。參加整理委員會之校友，係爲愛護學校，義不容辭。朱部長曾表示將來新校長人選，整理委員會可參加意見，故亦即新校長之試選委員會。惟參加整理委員會之委員僅供獻意見，而不出任校長。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕杭次長來滬處理交大工作，已吿一段落，於昨晚搭車返京。</p>
<p>整理時間　預定至少須一個月</p>
<p>〔另訊〕昨據交大校務整理委某委員吿稱：該會將一本公平寬大之原則，對於學校作必要而合理之整理，此項整理，包括多方面，大別約有數點：（一）舉行學生總登記，造具各册報部；（二）對於學行不良學生，將分別予以處理；（三）凡非交大學生，一律限令遷出校外；（四）學枝人事，將斟酌情形予以調整；（五）學校內部整頓，尤爲重要。該負責人並稱：整理時間，預定至少須一個月，在整理期間內，一般校務如常進行。又：交通大學工學院長裘維裕，教授周明，總務長季文美三氏，昨日上午十時，於杭次長主持之交大校務整理委員會第一次會議時，前往中央研究院拜訪杭氏，對該校整理意見，作友誼性之商談。</p>

<h3>等待時機即可實施　改革幣制並不困難　目前應有充份準備基金極易解決</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕改革幣制問題，自魏德邁特使來華後，各方又議論紛紜·茲中央銀行秘書處副處長范鶴言，特就渠個人立塲，對此發表意兌。渠稱我國幣制之改革，目前噸有充份之準備，以待時機，付諸實施。因抗戰八年以後，又遭共黨叛亂，通貨之發行，已使人民減低法幣之信念，如予改革，幣值可確定，物價常隨之穩定，而財政之收支，亦可漸趨平衡。且中國怯幣發行數字並不爲多，僅折合三四億美元，改革幣制之基金，極易解決。幣制改革以後，隨時將真實情形公開，自可減除人民無謂之懷疑。中國爲農業國家，人民吃苦耐勞，需要極爲簡單，各項物資，亦不如一般傳說之缺乏，故今日我國經濟情形，並不十分嚴重，最近軍事情况，業已轉好，局勢極爲安定，改革幣制，似可不必等待剿共軍事結束以後實現云。</p>
<h3>華股賣多於買　趨勢盤旋靡定</h3>
<p>華股昨僅永紗亦動盪中尚見平穩外，信和美亞更形頹廢，易跌難回，過程十分不景氣，良以精款繳納，使一般人心有銀根將緊之預感，趨勢不能樂觀。且現貨永紗開始見鬆，一般民間認股乘高出籠，而廣帮在塲內外亦有拋出，大勢上已不若前數日之緊湊，業中活動份子拋空股切，銀行帮初出後進，近收尚見平和。</p>
<p>晨開尚穩，遞永紗開後，由一一二號九四號進至二四〇元，一〇四號一七三號二三一號二一九號脫手，退至二三一元，一一二號一四三號尚進而有微漲，一五七號二一九號一〇五號一一二號二二四號，以及廣帮一五五號二一八號紛紛了結，一七一號並售現永紗，於九時二十分後，迫低至二二九元。一四三號一八八號一一六號一八三號二二三號九一號二一七號趁賤來納，回升至二四二元，八號一四號逢高供給，而遭阻過。二三二號進後亦出，二一二號二三一號一六三號二二四號一五二號一六〇號一八〇號紛賣，廣帮在塲外有所了結，人心復因銀根關係而稍疲，一七一號四五號一六〇號一五二號一八三號更供現永紗，近午將永紗即交迫低至二二八元，十二時後，散空抵補，二三五號六一號買進，五六號一九〇號並進現永紗，二一八號仍有供售，一七一號一〇六號尚賣現永紗，市價在二三〇元內外大事拉鋸。</p>
<p>臨收時，八號進遞永紗，一九〇號一五六號進現永紗，收價甚形穩健。次熟各股僅新光景福低後復易拉上外，信和美亞沉疴難起，結果較前收計即交股永紗微升，新光景福微挫，美亞信和跌半成，中法永公動興各跌一成光景，新華跌成半，景綸亦然。國貨成交不多而獨平，大通中紡統益火柴五和麗安水泥內衣微降，商務榮豐跌半成，中絲跌一成弱。遞交股計永紗獨平，景福美亞微挫，永公勤興信和華豐各跌半成強，塲外各老股平疲而趨跌者居多。</p>
<h3>統債回跌　外股盤小</h3>
<p>公債昨吿回跌，統戊所跌最微，統丙晨開九一〇〇元，低價八四〇〇元，最後在八九〇〇元收市。二〇三室三六〇室五五五室有納，而五五二室五〇三室有供，結果較前收計甲乙跌五〇〇元統丙降落四〇〇元，統丁低三〇〇元，統戊微挫一〇〇元，成交二百萬左右。</p>
<p>外股昨僅紙業因開股東會，引起利多消息，有掉換中國紙版公司股票之訊自二四〇〇〇元起，由洋商哄高至二七五〇〇元買價結束，餘股因刺激性能減低，咸見疲怯。怡紗晨開八五〇〇〇元，自八七〇〇〇元退至七九〇〇〇元，而後在八〇〇〇〇元外盤旋，證券帮金號業有售，廣帮洋行帮有納，結果較前收計紙業獨昂成半強，會德豐獨平，電話跌一成，怡紗祥泰跌半成，餘股均吿微降。。</p>
<h3>百餘社團推動　認購庫券運動</h3>

<h3>四行儲蓄會準備　償還戰前存款</h3>
<p>關於前存款償還問題，迄今尚未有適當解決辦法，以前法院判決照千倍至二千倍率償還，爲銀行界所微烈反對，立法院現又擬定以九百餘倍及三百餘倍二種倍率償還，且規定國家銀行及民間費務，不在此例，此點現亦引起各界反對。一般以爲國家銀行之戰前存款，若仍照一比一償還，無異使人民對國家行局庫失去一信用，此後何能利用正常方式，吸收儲蓄存款，故盼立法院完成立怯程序時，鄭重加以考慮。</p>
<p>又悉：戰前之存款，各商業銀行中，當以四行儲蓄會爲最多，聞該會俟償還倍數確定後，將變房地產以償遺所應償之倍數云。</p>

<p>龍頭細布昨開低盤成交，旋以零星有吸，行情一度回升，午收相近。因月底關係，銀根帶緊，吐售甚多，各貨軋小。龍頭細布四三萬四千元站定，其餘白坏等，亦多盤小，士林布導無變化。</p>

<h3>臺糖仍循例開配　糖市漲風受挫</h3>
<p>糖市於上週末受銀根鬆濫，及一百物回漲影響，漲潮重起，本期一棧單雙檔（中砂及車白精）須加二萬餘元，前日雖值星期，然以人心振奮，塲外仍有做開，棧單交易幾增一倍。昨晨開盤，續見一挺進，旋聞台唐公司前因出貨不及，暫將二期合併配售，今已恢復原狀，故自本期起，仍予每週開配，因之多頭紛紛出籠，市况一始由高峯迂廻下降，但仍較上週來軋升一萬餘元。</p>
<h3>原料貴成本增　火柴產量趨减</h3>
<p>本市火柴工業，足爲全國火柴工業之重心，所有各火柴廠之出品，銷於華中各省約佔五分之三，其餘則銷於華北各地，本市及四郊僅佔一小部份而已。本年度四。五·六月間，各火柴廠曾一度增加生產，運銷全國各地。</p>
<p>茲該業中人談稱：自七月以還，各廠之生產量已在開始降低，其最大原因爲外埠銷路減少，受戰事影響之各省區，如東北等固不能直接運銷前往，即其他各地，以工商凋敝，人民購買力日薄，尤以自海陸運費增加以來，銷往外埠成本加重，更增外埠用戶之負担。處此經濟情况中，其銷路之”減，自屬必然。</p>
<p>至製造成品方面，原料日缺，致價格高昂，更以工人工資之必須以生活指數計算後，更感成本一之難以預算，若製衣成品緊隨原料及人工之比例而昇漲，則銷路之維持，更屬可慮，故大部火柴廠即原料充足，寗儲原料，而酌量減少產品，以企少受損失，而期一待市面之好轉。</p>

<h3>化工染業難協議　限額原料分配糾紛　審議會代表將訪沈處長洽商</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸入管理委員會限額分配處，關於工業原料之限額，本已根據去年之進口成績，分配於進口商。嗣以工業原料有限，匯價明暗之差日甚，工業協會商同分配處，先就各工業公會間爲初步之分配，再與進口商取得聯絡，以謀國家外匯實益之直接分配於製迭業。後且由市商會工業協會，共同組織分配審議委員會，徵集各工業及商業同業公會之報吿，辦理協議，如拷皮膠·油脂·黑鐵皮·鐵·鋼絲·三角鐵·管子等，先後經有關公會，如肥皂工業·化妝品工業·鐵器工程·鐵器工業·五金商業·電工器材工業·罐頭食品工業·印鐵製罐工業·熟水瓶工業·五金零件商業之協議，分配停當，呈報分配處。其他原料，亦在陸續辦理治商中。</p>
<p>據審議會方面透露消息：費力最勤而最難得到協議者，爲染料及化工原料，此二者俱己三數次召集各有關工業，及商業公會會議，參加者各達二十餘單位，其各工業公會因早己依照工業協會之通知，務希尊重協議，尚能和衷共濟。其會負廠家，亦尚能聽從其公會之指示，靜待分配。但化學原料商業公會，及顏料商業公會，始終未能協議。</p>
<p>昨日下午爲染料分配會議，各工業公會之集於市商會者廿四業，而顔料業又吿缺席，致工商之間，協議迄未成立。在分配處方面，則催促甚嚴，且表示已急不及待，火有開放之意。審議會負責人甚表焦慮。昨日會塲中，有多數人主張，如協議不成立，分配不公，將請政府直接辦理進口原料，然後由中央信託局，以分批標賣方式，售與實用之戶。</p>
<p>據市商會方面透露消息：昨日分配處有公兩到會，對於審議會辦理協議之緩，表示遺憾。並稱第一季限額，己有十分之七簽出云云。惟聞常初市商會與工業協會組織審議會，以辦理協議時，本係分配處處長沈奏庭氏當面囑託，且經呈報有案。今審議會正在協議，而分配處已開放至十分之七，殊使忠實者向隅，無論在商會在工業協會，以至在各工業同業公會，俱難以向其會員交待云。</p>
<p>審議會昨己推定代表，定於今日上午，訪問沈處長，商討辦法。一部份之意見，擬請分配處以裁定方式，規定工商業間之比率，另一部份之意見，則主張向全國經濟委員會爲有力之控訴，以糾正當前之貿易政策。</p>
<h3>昨市開盤即慘落　人造絲疲莫能興　廠經交易稀綢貨價挫軟</h3>
<p>人造絲因配售在即，人心虛軟，故昨市開盤即吿慘落。一二〇號東羊有光，開盤賈二千四百七十萬元爲散裝貨，迄中午盤旋在四百四十萬元至六十萬元之間。下午最小價爲四百二十萬元，最後收盤價爲四百四十萬元。高山有光最後價爲四百二十萬元賣出　，較上週六下降二百萬元之譜。</p>
<p>廠經交易甚稀，行情呈疲，BC等級討價在三千萬元左右，但担有交易，價做二千八百萬及八百五十萬元兩檔，不過貨款均有一星期期頭。下午E字等級有十五担成交，價有十萬元上落，十擔做二千八百五十萬元，五担做二千八百四十萬元，貨款半數現交，半數打票七在期頭。千經零担喊價一千七百五干萬元，次者價在一千六百五十萬至七百萬元之間。</p>
<p>綢貨亦吿疲軟，真絲被面交易雖旺，行情未見抬頭，華強被面開市一千〇七十二萬及七十一萬元均有成交，旋即做七十萬元則期價，七十四萬元隔日期，中途經拉抬，略吿微升，隔日期做七十八萬元，後又低落。即期價盤旋在七十萬元之間，收市無甚變化。大誠被面最後爲七十五萬元，隔日期喊八十萬元。美亞被面一百五十萬元乏成交，大誠格子　縐疲莫能興，人心渙散，交易淸淡。開市喊六千元賣出價，無人過問，旋即降至五千五百元，還價五千元而未成交，結果三萬五千二百元有人要。華錦縐上午二萬二千元，下午因人絲低降，之人問訊，其餘各貨，成交極稀價亦銷軟。</p>

<h3>四強分配小型日艦　日本海軍解體</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員傅俊儀</p>
<p>東京廿四日航訊</p>
<p>戰前日本原爲二大海軍國之一，建軍之始，即着重海軍。明治三年（一八七〇年）三月兵部省於「創立海軍意見書」中曾謂：「國勢之強弱，不在兵力之大小，兵力之大小，與軍費之多寡有關。他日如欲雄飛世界，尚須討議頃注國力擴張海軍之策。」日本海軍建艦之初，軍艦多購自歐洲，技師亦多自國外聘來，在一八七二年，日本海軍的勢力，僅有艦雙十四艘，計一萬二千三百五十二噸。最大的兵艦「襲　號」僅二千五百卅噸，自一八七〇年後，因與我淸廷爲琉球歸屬問題，及台灣問題發生爭端，日本建艦目標，即在對抗淸廷艦隊，淸廷之「定選」及「鎮遠」二大戰艦，均爲七千三百三十五噸之鐵甲艦，而日本之最大巡洋艦「嚴島」「松島」及「穚立」僅爲四千三百噸。</p>
<p>晚淸中日戰後，日本建艦目摖在對抗俄國的東洋艦隊，當時軍艦大部購自英國。其後美國海軍勢力抬頭，自海軍軍縮會議後，日本建艦目標爲之一變，其假想敵乃轉向美國，預料日美兩國在太平洋洋上心有短兵相見之一日，處心積慮，企圖先發制人，於短期作戰中獲得勝利，終於不官而戰，扮演了偷襲珍珠港的醜劇。日人稱之爲「以制機先攻擊」的戰略。後期日本建艦的特徵，即着重此點。即採取大砲巨艦主義’過於重視攻擊能力，而減少了船員乘坐所佔的位置並防禦能力。一旦遭遇強力航艦空軍攻擊時，即舉手無措，窮於應付，全軍歸於覆沒。日本海軍自偷襲珍珠港後，經四大海戰，即珊瑚海戰，中途島海戰，塞班島海職，菲島海戰後，即一敗塗地，日本艦隊的秘寶，誇示世界的兩大戰體「大和」與「武藏」，也不能挽救日本海軍的敗勢。「大和」在沖繩島海戰中，「武藏」在菲島海戰中相繼沉沒，終於敵不過美國航艦機的最後一擊。日本海軍在這次大戰中，損失殆盡，其一詳細數字有如下表：</p>
<p>戰時日本艦船損失表</p>
<p>首批日艦各獲八艘</p>
<p>波茨坦宣言規定日本陸海軍應完全解除武裝。日本投降後，海車自吿消滅。關於剩餘軍艦的處置，美對日理事會代表艾琪遜大使曾於一九四六年九月十八日對日理事會中中稱：大於潛水艇之大型軍艦，或將其解體破壞，或將其擊沉，惟其中尚有爲復員所用者，俟往務完畢後即將其解體破壤，至艦艇所用之兵器，亦將加以破壞。據去年九月，二十八日麥帥總部發表：除復員所用之驅逐艦外，其他大型軍艦，均遵照總司令命令，加以解體破壞，所得廢話量將達一五八，一八〇噸，此種工作預定，在本年內完成現已破壞者爲二一，〇一〇噸，佔全體噸數之百分之一三·三（％）。破壞之軍艦總排水量爲三九五，一七一噸。據稱現除復員所用一三一艘外，尚有若干艘由日人駕駛，作爲哨海之用。極據委帥總部規定；日軍解除武裝後，所有武器均應交與美軍保管，加以破壞，但可提出一部作爲紀念品及戰利品。美海軍遠東總司令部特將剩餘日艦，提出九十六艘（內驅逐艦二十四艘海防艦六十八艘，運輸艦四艘）以抽籤方式分與中美英蘇四國，分三批舉行，第一批於上月二十四日在麥帥總部第一相互大厦舉行，儀式頗爲隆萬。參加者有我國代表馬德廷海軍上校，美國代表巴德上校，（遠東海軍司令部參謀長）英國代表塞蒂茲上校，蘇聯代表司蒂葉戈少將等。第一批分攤之軍艦爲三十二艘，內驅逐艦十二艘，海防艦二十艘，每國八艘。我國所抽得者，乃其中之最優秀者，今列表如下：</p>
<p>我國所抽得之日艦表</p>
<p>第一次我國分攤之艦隻已於七月一日自佐世保駛往上海，第二批抽籤亦已於十七日上午在美海軍遠東司令部舉行，出席代表與第一次相同，每國分得八艘，英國分得八九一〇噸，美國分得八六六〇噸，蘇聯分得八四五〇噸，我國分得八四五〇，品質遠不如前次之佳，多係一九四五年少出品，其種類如下：</p>
<p>艦名　艦種　建造年月　噸數</p>
<p>蔦　驅逐艦　一九四三—四五年　一五八〇</p>
<p>杉　同上　同上　一五三〇</p>
<p>第一一八號　一級海防艦　一九四四—四五年　九〇〇</p>
<p>第一九八號　同上　同上　同上</p>
<p>第一九二號　同上　同上　同上</p>
<p>第二〇五號　二級海防艦　同上　八一〇</p>
<p>第八五號　同上　同上　同上</p>
<p>對馬　海防艦　一九三九年　一〇二〇</p>
<p>第二批抽得之日艦，將於本月廿六開滬，第三批抽籤有三十二艘，將於八月間舉行，所抽得之艦隻，均無武裝設備，尚有第四批四十八艘，如何分配，中美英蘇四國尚在商議中。</p>
<p>日艦優劣觀感互異</p>
<p>就此次分配日艦之意義，走軍代表馬德建上校，據稱：「此次分得之兵艦固爲有限，其意義則甚重大，我國海防數十年來受日寇侵略，經我八年不屈抗戰，不僅國恥已雪，且得與列強並肩分配海軍戰利品，食乃無限光榮」。並據此次護送第一批艦隻返國之鐘漢波海軍少校吿記者稱：〔此次分得之海防艦，對於我國南海及東西沙羣島之海防不無小一補，蓋因日艦構造輕巧，噸位較一小，使用油量鮫少，材油五噸，一可航行二百四十海哩。各種維持及修理工作，均適合於中國技術條件。」又日戰前海軍評論家現任共同通訊社理事長伊藤正德關於日艦之優劣吿記者稱：「日艦建造，多集中於加強戰力之一點，即儘量加強砲火之力量，而忽視人類之居住性，即船員乘坐所佔之位置，遠不及武器所佔之地位軍要，宜於攻擊，而劣於防守，作戰過久，則兵員易感疲勞，故不適台於南洋熟帶之作戰條件，速力雖高，但續航力則較小。」</p>
<p>日本海軍的武器已遭破壞，可是日本復員海軍人員的精神上的改造，尚有待於日人的自覺和盟國的監視。</p>

<h3>新港督蒞任記</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者程志政</p>
<p>香港廿五日航訊</p>
<p>自從卸任香港總督楊慕琦爵士在五月十六日離港以後，香港人民，時時期待着新總督的來臨，直到今天（七月廿五日）新總督賈乃涵爵士（Sir　Alexander　William　George　Herder　Grantham）姍姍來遲的終於到港了！歌舞昇平的香港，平添了一番熱鬧，雖然天公不做美，下了整整一天的雨，可是彩旗飄揚，樂聲洋溢，全息居民，情緒依然十分熱烈</p>
<p>大雨滂沱　新督飛來</p>
<p>賈乃涵總督夫婦乘英國海外航空公司專機，今晨離星飛港，澦定下午三時到啓德機塲，因爲大雨滂沱，直到下午沒有停住，許多人都擔心着新總督的航空安全，認爲無論如何，他今天是不能到港了！豈知三時纔過，海外航室公司的飛機，已在香港雲霧裏出現了，一會兒，機師運用巧妙的技能，平安降落，總督首先下機，和歡迎他的代理總督麥高道，駐港海陸空軍司令官等一一握手，總營身體高大，頭禿，雙目炯炯，精神健旺，似乎沒有旅途勞頓的樣子，夫人身材矮小，和總督站在一起，幾乎相差一頭，他們在機塲休息室休息了一會兒，更換了總督官服，乘坐金冕號專輪渡海，四時三刻到達皇后碼頭，碼頭裏學已排列了一批重要官紳以及各國使節，總督登陸後，和歡迎羣衆一一握手，許多是港督的舊友，所以格外親切。站在碼頭外面廣塲上的有海陸空軍各一隊，當總督步出碼頭的時候，樂隊高奏英國國歌，三軍舉槍致敬，港督答禮，因雨太大，並未檢閱，隨即乘車至督府休息。</p>
<p>動人演詞博得掌聲</p>
<p>下午六時，娛樂大戲院裏舉行了一個盛大的歡迎會，臺上所坐的貴賓，除總督夫婦外，有英太平洋艦隊總司令包毅德等三十多人，兩位主教穿了紅衣，戴着假髮，吸引了不少觀衆的視綫，樓下是普通來賓席，記者席，樓上是市民席，上下人都擠滿，真是空前未有的成况。港督穿着大禮服，坐在正中，態度十分嚴肅，國歌奏完，由匯豐銀行總經理摩士代表市民致歡迎詞，摩士拿着一　篇做好的演詞，流水似的讀下去，無非是謳歌總督的許多照例文章，接着由周佼年把譯文朗誦一遍，譚文用工楷寫在裝璜精美的尺頁上面，大概是預備送給總督做紀念的。</p>
<p>一會兇總督起立致答詞，他並沒有預擬的演稅稿，但他的演詞，不僅有條理，有意義，而且音調和諧，十分動人，他說：香港是他的第二故鄉，他過去在香港服務了十二年，能在今天回來看到許多老朋友，心裏十分快慰，接着他就最近老察過的許多國家來說，沒有一個國家不是這遇着政治上經濟上的困難，美國也不能例外，他承認香港百廢待舉，財力支絀，但他希望與市民合作，與友好而偉大的中國合作，達成復興香港的願望。</p>
<p>他演講完畢，掌聲幾乎延長到五分鐘，這充分表示他的演詞是何等動人，何等真摯。周俊年譯了華語後，總督夫婦先退，他們再趕到立法局去宣誓就職，這一個下午，新總督是够忙了。當英戰鬥艦貝爾法斯號鳴砲十七響的時候，香港人民普遍知一道新總督是就任了。</p>
<p>舊地生遊刮目相看</p>
<p>賈乃涵大士是劍橋爵學畢業生，後入陸軍軍官學校受軍事訓練，第一次世界大戰時，他在法國比利時作戰，卓著戰功，一九二二年來港，初任中央裁判署法官，後升助理輔政司，一九三四年離港，入英國防禦軍事專門學校，一九三五年永嘉任百慕他羣島補政司，三年後，調牙買加爲輔政司，一九四一平開尼日利亞輔政司，一九四五年榮獲爵士銜，同年奉委任斐濟羣島總督兼總司令，及西太平洋高級專員，今春奉委現職，年四十八歲，夫人爲美國加利福尼亞州人，結褵十餘載，尚無子女。</p>
<p>新任港督賈乃涵博士</p>
<h3>江西農村與工鑛</h3>
<p>— 本報記者劉藻</p>
<p>南昌二十日航訊</p>
<p>號稱「江右毅倉」的江西，凋村經濟的農敝，與百分之八十以上人民生活的窮困，真有說不盡的悽慘，去年夏季「店山人」沒有猪肉吃，今年江西人依然沒有餘糧喂猪。</p>
<p>肥沃的贛土，刻苦耐勞的江西老百姓，有了這些優越條件，爲什麽他們的生活，如此凋敝悽慘，使得「江右谷倉」的福地，變成啼飢號寒的流亡之區。</p>
<p>匪亂戰禍，直接加害到農村的魔掌，一直到現在伕然沒有解除，因爲目前江西還負祖着巨額的軍糧輪出，同時還要供應一些巧立名目的敲詐，高利盤剝，老百姓終年辛勞所得，在新谷登塲後，除了繳納國家正課與高利貸的債項外，留在自己谷倉裏的運下年的種籽亦不够，所以，野草，谷糠，是窮苦老百姓的「恩物」</p>
<p>農村中之所以如此窮困，主要原因：荒地遍野，人力畜力缺乏，肥料與醫藥不够，以及疾病天災的侵害，如何使農村增加生產，是解決窮困老百姓的生活唯一辦法。</p>
<p>江西的工業，戰前落後在湘粵等省，戰時在贛西南却建立了一點基礎，這些工業幼苗，不料遭逢到勝利將臨時敵軍由南而北的竄擾，現在又受到物價，與工資的高壓，出品滯銷，復員前途，更時黯淡。</p>
<p>戰時江西的重工業，有資委會與江西省政府合辦的機器，煉鐵，車船，電工，硫酸，和水泥廠，這些規模初備的工廠房屋，與機器，十分之九被燬於敵軍，損失至少在四億元以上，至於輕工一業，有省營興業公司的酒精，糖一，織染，麻織，製革，鋸木，瓷一，印刷等十一個廠，也是因爲敵軍幾次竄擾而被破壞，民營的有火柴罐頭，紡織，印刷幾十個廠，全被播燬倒閉，就是聞各世界的景德鎮的瓷業，原有一百五十餘座瓷窑，在戰時遭受敵機轟炸，業已損壞大半，現在開工復業的不及三分之一。</p>
<p>贛南的鎢礦，是江西礦產中的珍竇，全省產量，據官方調查，大庾龍南等十七縣，儲藏量達四〇〇萬噸，佔世界第一位，戰前年產量一五〇〇噸，三十三年敵軍由粵北竄入贛南，奪取鎢礦，也是它的戰略目的之一，至於鎢砂與礦床，自然被敵人盡力破壞得一塌糊塗，目前是無怯開工。</p>
<p>其次是樂平的錳礦，煤礦，以及萍鄉，餘干，等縣的煤區，總儲藏量約七億噸，每年產量，約在八百萬噸以上，戰前南潯，浙贛鐵路，以及本省各電廠與贛江輸船所需的煤，都靠贛煤供應，原有的幾家大煤礦，如安源天河等處，均以戰時破壞停止，或因交通運輸困難，無怯運銷，現在亦正待大批資金扶助，以謀復工</p>
<p>江西的鐵礦，據一般佔計，全省總儲量，約二，〇〇〇萬噸，其中以永新烏石山的質量最好，卅一年起，每天可出翻砂鐵二〇噸，世三年遭逢敵軍的破壞，亦受到很大的損失。</p>
<p>從江西的鑛產儲藏量看，不但足够建立大規模的輕工業，而日可以換取巨額外匯，現在如能使它從速復工興業，國富與省級財政，不但可以增加，並可解決一部份的工鑛技工的失業。</p>
<p>在復員的旅途中，農村與工鑛事業，應該獲得適當的救濟與扶助，江西的善後工作，在農業方面，亦曾舉辦緊急救濟，推行貸放耕牛，水車，散發種籽，肥料，農具，修建農舍，以及興修農田水利，工程，辦理耕牛防疫，病害虫防治，這些工作，直接或間接予農村以實惠，尤以水利工程一項，一億元的賑款復堤，完成了南昌·新建·永修三縣的決口，險段土方六。一二〇·三七七公方，涵閘一七〇座，堤長七八〇·五三〇公尺，受惠田畝八八〇·六五四市畝，堵口復堤工程，在南昌湖口等十六縣，完成土方三八·八三二·二二〇·一三公尺，石方一·三六三四·五〇公尺；受惠田畝三·七五一·一一八市畝，今年六月間贛境各段河流，由於山洪暴發，水位陡漲，突破歷年的嚴高水位，而各地河堤，安全無恙，農間亦吿有收，這是農業救濟中的一大功效。</p>
<p>工業復員聲中，江西的工鑛事業，因爲遭到慘重的破壞，而善後救濟的力量，又是微弱到可憐猶如巧婦難爲無米之炊！總配發給中國的工廠設備，雖然可以廉價與優待的辦法獲得，但是，江西的工業界，就沒有力量去爭取這些價廉物美的工廠設備，旅居京滬的贛籍聞人如桂永淸·劉士毅·劉峙等一再響應江西善救分署的倡議，爭取工業機械，現在中國農業機械公司江西分公司雖然成立了籌備會，六十億股金的籌措，目前依然感到許多的困難。</p>
<p>江西現階段的農村與工鑛事業，耳前的困難，還是自身經濟力量貧乏，難以走上迅速復興的大道，但是，過去江西獲得行總配發的救濟物資，據江西分署在記者招待會的報吿，自去年一月至四月，僅收到二萬七千多噸，不足湖南配額的四分之一。</p>
<p>現在千百萬隻農工事業之手，正伸出向社會呼籲，江西需要更多的救濟物資，尤豈是工鑛事業，更待外力的援助。</p>
<h3>煉焦專家兪再麟之生平</h3>
<p>— 周劍</p>
<p>北平廿日航訊</p>
<p>礦冶專家俞再麟氏，一生研究礦學，蜚聲中外，此次固守北票煤礦，不幸於七月二日被共軍攻陷，俞氏竟以身殉。國家人才，如此慘死，令人痛悼。本報曾誌詳情。經濟部中央地質調查所北平分所所長高平氏，與俞氏交稱莫道，有四絨同窗，廿五年相知之誼，特擬俞氏生平事蹟一文，頗爲詳盡，爰錄大意如次：</p>
<p>七月四日報載「北票消息不明」；余即急電錦州北票煤礦公司總經理雷寳華氏詢間在北票賓際主持人兪再麟右之行踪。復常未到，即突接見新煤礦總經理郭象豫氏來電報凶：「北票於二日爲共軍攻陷，再麟兄竟以身殉」；閱後悵然若失，惟尚冀其言之失實也。十四日復得北票消息，謂共軍於八日夜自動撤退，國軍於九日安然進駐礦區，俞君之殉職亦已證實，是俞君竟死矣！哀哉！日前又接友人自錦州所得消息，俞君屍體，已爲野犬所齒食，僅得白骨十二根，用棉包裝後於十四日在錦州忠烈祠入殮。如此慘死，令人無限痛悼；余與君四載同窗，二十五年良友，故知之甚稔；爰述兪君生平，永誌不忘。</p>
<p>俞君再麟字醉令，浙江嵊縣人，生於民國紀元前四年。爲人爽直，俠義，而貌極文雅。幼勤學，率爲同級冠。民國十一年入省城安定中學，同學中皆敬其對人誠摯，遇事負責，故　爲代表，時學潮汹涌，君認爲吾輩靑年應以學業爲重，極力避免捲入；同學從之，師長均愛之。余與君甚友善，但平時除研討學問外，不談其他，畏友也。畢業後相偕北上。君考入北洋大學，越二年，升入本科採冶系。民國二十一年卒業，入開　礦務局工作，凡二年，以研究興趣濃厚，改入建設委員會，從事礦冶設計工作；旋國防設計委員會（即今之資源委員會）礦室（即經濟部礦冶研究所前身）成立，兪君加入工作，專研究各省煤之提選，及煉焦問題；著作甚多。時君在社會上工作，基礎己立。乃與同邑錢愛琴女士結婚，錢女士畢業於杭州省立高中，勤儉誠摯，夫婦志同道合，愛情彌篤。其時南京房租高昂，而公務員收入微薄，俞君夫婦僅租得小屋一間，且日間尚爲他人之過道。余嘗往訪，君謂目前物質生活雖苦，但工作興趣殊濃厚，可見其專心研究十精神，實爲日後成功之主因也。</p>
<p>八一三事變發生，敵人濫炸南京，日以繼夜。君遺夫人　子先返嵊縣，而己則日夜不離礦室。是年九月三日夜，其鄰院中彈，礦室門窗均被震碎，瓦石飛舞，君幾遭不測。警報解除後，余即渦訪，（地質調查所與資委會礦室在同一大門內）君喘息甫定，正在整理礦空資料準備裝箱他運；其臨難不苟，負責到底之精神率如此。</p>
<p>戰事擴大，政府自京而漢，自漢而渝。兪君挾礦室所有圖書儀器，並其數年來研究紀錄，轉輾西遷、是時礦室已改組爲經濟部礦治研究所，在重慶北百餘里之和觀岩下，重建試騐室，繼讀研究。惟戰局急轉直下，華北及長江下游均已放棄，在後方之大西南，必須建立小規模鋼鎮工業，始能繼續抗戰。四川煤礦，能合於煉冶金焦之侏羅紀煤層太薄，難作大規模開採；而厚層之二疊紀煤層，以含硫及灰份太高，無法供冶煉之用。於是君在實騐室中研究並試騐此含硫　過高之二疊紀煤，如何能以經濟簡單方法洗選煉焦殫精竭力，卒告成功。兩時四川若干小型化鐵爐己開爐，治金焦煤，需求孔急；逾君乃將其試騐所得，建立一試騐煉焦廠於馬柳灘，供給沿嘉陵江兩岸諸小型化鐵爐之需，其對於抗戰建國，厥功甚偉。</p>
<p>兪君任事，公私分明，辦理煉焦廠時，廠方建有辦公室及單身宿舍，君雖爲廠長，不愿將家眷遷入，獨在水風埡租居民房一間生活極簡陋。卅年余過君寓時，已有兩子一女，以物價高漲，無力雇傭，夫人操作甚勞，而君則一日往返四次，風雨無阻，不以爲苦。</p>
<p>卅一年冬，君奉資源委員會令派赴美國研究洗煤煉焦，受命倉猝，匆忙就道；其時夫人甫經分娩，僻處山谷中，照應乏人，加以物價弗漲，薪津所入，不足維持其四個兒女之家；君行後不數日間，其夫人竟以刺激過深，神經錯亂，雖多方醫治，仍歸無效。關山議隔，且正值世界大戰方酣，旅途困難，未克滬返。兪君抵美後，悉愛妻得病，心緒雖亂，但仍以研究爲重，以不負政府之期望。在匹次堡卡氏研究院從勞萊氏研究，並不時赴各地礦廠考察。</p>
<p>旅美兩年頗多心得。卅四年三月君返抵國門，重理舊業，在天府煤礦內，設立一較大規模之煉焦廠。時生產局成立，中美技術上合作密切，美方迭派選煤煉焦專家來華，對於俞君設計工作，甚表欽佩。國人自求學，實習，研究，試騐，設廠，出國考察，再返國擴大設廠，其步驟之正當，成續之優良，若兪君者，誠不多見也</p>
<p>抗虎勝利，兪君被派赴東北，協同接收撫順煤礦。事成後，君以學非所用，且病妻弱子亟待照料，及請假赴川，率眷返嵊縣原籍。時東北局勢好轉，鋼鐵及機械工業即將開工，冶金焦煤，急待大量生產。資委會及於去歲十二月如君再赴東北，任北票煤礦工務處長。原擬大量增產，自待</p>
<p>洗煤煉焦供給各鋼鐵機械廠之用，不意到任後，北票屢被共軍圍攻，君以責任心重，到礦後，迄未離礦一步。六月初，余行抵阜新，距北票僅二百里，致電俞君，、擬前往晤談及參觀，君復電謂北票仍緊，拒絕前往，不料竟爾永訣</p>
<p>俞君遺有病妻及子三，女二，均年幼。最長者僅十三歲，身後極爲悽慘。君於上月間曾致余最後一函謂：「去年弟自撫順南歸，本不想再來東北，不料孫公堅囑非來北票不可；召集與家人分離，小孩又無人管教，月入七十餘萬法幣，尚不足家人溫飽，個人如居虎穴……」於今讀之，悽然欲絕！</p>
<p>該文末段，強調我國人才有限，培植非易，此後極盼政府對於技術人才，如俞再麟氏者，加意愛護，在必要時，應令技術人員先行撤退，保留國家元氣，而不致在戰亂中遭受莫大之損失。</p>

<h3>初生之犢　外蒙剪影</h3>
<p>本報資料室</p>
<p>外蒙——這個新興的國家，正像一頭不畏虎的初生之犢。對於中國，僅新彊，犯緩遠，那跋扈的態度，是够令人驚異的。</p>
<p>今日外蒙的居民，還過着原始時代的游牧生活，但在同時，畜牧事業供應了外蒙人最滋養的食物，游牧生活也鍛鍊了外蒙人民強健的體格。何况廣漠下面，更蘊藏着豐富的寳藏：大量的褐煤，蘇打，石墨，金，銀，銅，鐵，鉛，銻，硫磺，石綿等，這許多都是很重要的原料。</p>
<p>外蒙的天賦是很厚的，蘇聯垂涎三尺，盡人皆知。赤色的浪潮，波及了寂靜古老的外蒙以來，蒙共從喇嘛和王公的手中，獲取了政權，確立了新的行政系統，在廣大沙漠地帶實施了所謂社會主義的政治與文化活動。</p>

<h3>「太平廣記」的成因</h3>
<p>— 荊有麟</p>
<p>中國漢唐以來的小說，今日還能供我人研究參考的，「太平廣記」的功勞，要算是最大了。因為歷代的變亂及散俠，好些見於歷代藝文誌的小段，到我們這個時代，根本找不到蹤影。特別是一般筆記小說，及傳奇文，因了不為一般士大夫所重視，能留傳下來，寶在是很少很少。到了宋太宗太平興國時，　家圖書館崇文院，積　八萬卷有荀。據「宋人遺事　編」，所引「揮慶後錄」上講：——</p>
<p>「太平興國時，諸降王俱死。其舊臣或有怨言。太宗盡收用之。置之館閣，使修書。如冊府元　，文苑英華，太平廣記之類。廣其卷軼，厚其　錄　給，以役其心，多卒老於交字之間。」</p>
<p>这里所表現的，雖然有一段傷心史，而且宋太宗的本意，並非為文化本身而著想。不過為防止唐代遺老，再造他的反，便勅置祟文院，廣收天下书籍，把一般懷古的文人，一齊收容對祟文院，并厚給膽養。於是便有「太平廣記」及「太平御覽」之類的保藏古籍的文獻遣留給我們。據「太平廣記」所收採的書：多至三百四十五種，且原書至今，＋九皆已佚亡，這真是小說史上的佳話了。</p>
<p>但「太平廣記」，並不像「太平御覽」及「文苑英華」得到當時的重視。據傳：太平興國二年三月奉詔撰　，以李助監修。徐鉉，吳淑等十二人同修，到太平興國三年八月，構成表進，即奉勅送史館。史館一擺就是二年多，到六年正月，始奉旨彫印板。不幸又有輕視小說的人，向宋太宗說：遺種東西，非後學所急，於是又不要印有了，原版乃收貯太清樓。這一樓次時間更長久，整例宋代，「太平廣記」，都未能與世人見面，直到明代中葉，十山譚氏得到抄本，始印刻行世。因此，連宋人都沒看到這部寶藏。</p>
<p>「太平廣記」共五頁卷，九十二部。其中分門別類，將隋唐以來各種談狐說怪，記神記鬼，以及奇物異事，特殊人物，各種筆記小說，幾乎收羅殆遍。使吾人今日能知道一些漢魏六朝，隋唐五代等朝的小說真面目。這一部寶藏，算盡了最大的功效了。</p>
<h3>雨中</h3>
<p>— 葛尚德</p>
<p>雨顯然比　上電車時大得多，爾水從車實的隙縫巾潺這來，把座位沾濕了。搭客們的　宇聞，　含　著焦念和愁怨；但了們都無言的沉默著。車廂中呈現著　息的狀態。</p>
<p>車子開到了－個站頭，有些　客冒雨下車了。我因為已經到了目的地，也就下了車。車站旁邊是一道高牆，祗有一個書報攤的布幕可以暫時容身，我就隨著幾個搭汗急促的張　的跑到這個布幕下米避雨了。</p>
<p>雨是愈下愈大起來。</p>
<p>幕小人多，我的上身因為離開布幕近，還能得到蔭蔽；似下身由於雨點的直接侵擊，以及內於布幕上積水下注地面再來著街泥向上反擊的緣故，弄得又濕又髒。</p>
<p>布幕是有些漏洞的，布幕上一部份的積水由漏洞裏注下來，於是上身也有些濕潤了。</p>
<p>一夥人都很焦急，但父都很沉默，聽任這滂沱的大雨來制抑住了他們的行動。</p>
<p>好幾輛電車經過了這站頭，但都沒有搭客下軍；他們大概選中了下面一個有避雨地方的站頭去下車吧？</p>
<p>三三兩兩的汽車在雨中疾駛，車輪下撥出像浪花一樣的水花；雨點打上街頭，發出沙沙的聲響。</p>
<p>「每天生寫根好嗎？」是一個女學生模樣的避雨者，在向這個　報攤主人發問，打破了我們遺一夥臨時湊築在一塊的人們間的沉寂。</p>
<p>「生意不大好，不過勉強過去吧了。」是主人的回答。</p>
<p>這時我才開始注意這位女主人來了。她身體瘦瘦的；面部更見瘦削，但還有些紅潤，一件藍布的旗袍，相常配身。腳上穿著一雙雨鞋，沒穿襪子。年約四十左右。態度是很溫順的，一品牌地音，相當柔瀾。說話時露出很自然的笑容。</p>
<p>她倆正在　談的時候，一輛汽車開到當報攤前，戛然而止。車內祇有一個司機，他伸出手來向女主人買某一份小報。女主人熟練地在架上揀出了某一份小報，　給司機。汽車隨即駛去了。</p>
<p>「這汽軍的老閣每天經過此地，總要買小報看；有時空軍開過，就由這車夫代買。」女主人在向那位攀談者媽娓地述　。</p>
<p>我在這布幕下逗留了約牛小時光景，直到滂沱大雨變為絲絲細雨，天空有些放睛時才離開。——這時，其他避雨者，連那位女學生模樣的女士在內，也都先後難去了。——在這約莫半小時的時間之內，我始終沒有見過這位女主人對於道一　「不速之客」有過絲毫憎惡的表情；相反的，她是始終和藹可親，始終露著一副純真的笑容。</p>
<p>對於她的這種「濟人之急」的偉大的精紳，我是深深地感動了。</p>
<p>第二天，那是一個驕陽肆虐的日子的正午，我因事又走過了那個書報攤旁邊。使我感到失望的是：我沒有看到那位女主人，祇見到有一個男小該在那裏代行她的職務。我不禁駐足向那位小孩凝視了好一會。他大約是那位女主人的孩子。年約十一二歲，身體頗健碩。在他圓圓的　腴的臉上，和明晰的靈活的眼中，正流露著和他母規同樣的溫厚、和穆、誠摯的神情。</p>
<p>在離開他的時候，我不自禁地為他擔心；那一幅昨天擋過暴雨的布幕，過一會兒，將摭　不住漸漸西移的太陽刺斜裏放射過來的陽光；他是否能經受得起這肆虐的炎陽的煎熬？</p>
<p>我虔誠地默默地為他們母子祝福！</p>
<h3>還有雜詩</h3>
<p>— 李楚材</p>
<p>黎明離大安，經　縣褒城留壩廟臺鳳縣，越秦嶺，過大散關益門鎮，渡渭河，遂入實雞。</p>
<p>大安空際兩三里，賤價胡桃穀滿汀；鎮裏人酣家室夢，行人已度萬山青。</p>
<p>武侯祠外水灣灣，　縣城邊客意　，扶漢稱王壇不在，風雲猶繞定軍山。</p>
<p>褒城　沐問農耕，如絮午雲嶺上生；自古慰懷惟一笑，可知傾國獨傾城。</p>
<p>留壩居然空蕩蕩，（縣城過去為匪擾，居民分遷四鄉，至今仍為空郭。）廟　喜見柏森森；千秋猶重酬韓節，一瞥徒殷慕古心！（廟臺在紫柏山　，以留侯張良廟所在得名，山水甚佳，以趕行匆過未得入內瞻仰。）</p>
<p>鳳縣峰高四　開，（縣城位風嶺間）當年伯氏度此來，一家泰半均過往，應向山靈　謝盃。（民初家兒百川先生任職陝南觀察使署道尹公署，抗戰後內子繪雲及兒女由陝赴渝，次姪雄伯及妻女任職漢中及城固省銀行均過此也。）</p>
<p>秦雲秦嶺掩秦關，關下　山無數灣；自昔用兵多守此，茲來猶自動心顏。</p>
<p>益門鎮外渭流橫，十載關河眼底迎；渡水歡然到陳實，秦中故土最移情！</p>
<h3>蛾眉小唱</h3>
<p>— 厂嵐</p>
<p>銀河</p>
<p>夏夜，仰臥在竹床上，看看那橫渦夜空的銀河，空會帶給你童年花期的甜蜜的回憶。</p>
<p>回憶，像是一個細雨濛濛的黃昏，飘渺的夢境一樣，是清晰的，当你他細地去捕捉他的時候，它卻像一個狡詐的精灵，悄悄地溜走了，不給你留下一絲痕跡。……</p>
<p>在这样的夜裹，我想起了那一逝去的童年，想起了那夏夜裏關於銀河的故事。</p>
<p>……向日葵送別了夕陽，悲戚地垂下了頭。紡織娘和一些不知道名子的小虫，為逝去了的白畫，唱起單調的輓歌。</p>
<p>燥熱，將消逝在陣陣的晚風裏，我們天真地要祖母為我們講述天河的故事。</p>
<p>祖母，滿佈著縐紋的臉龐，和藹地展開了微笑，她競：</p>
<p>在遠古的年代裏，一個牧牛的孩子，和天闕上織女，怎樣築起深攀的愛情，據說當他們「　緣」已滿的時候，西王母——那個狠心的老太婆，用她的銀簪，在天幕上劃上了一道深深的鴻溝，那倏銀亮的鴻溝，就是天河。這條大塹，殘酷地阻隔了熱戀的情人。只有那些好心的鳥兒，在七月七日午皮深沉的時候，為他倆架起一道輕便的鵲橋，讓他們儘情地傾訴那蘊藏在心度的，年來的衷曲。他倆的眼淚，流著，化成了雨滴……。</p>
<p>我們都默然地聽著，在童年的心上，激起了微微的波瀾，我們開始為那一對情侶，慨嘆命運的坎坷。</p>
<p>……老祖母　開我們已經好多年了，只有那條在夜空裏閃著　光的天河，仍如住昔。</p>
<p>讓我祈禱祖母的靈魄安息，讓我祝福那一對多情的伴侶。</p>
<p>流螢</p>
<p>流螢，飛翔在夏夜裏，雖然他的光輝是那樣的微弱，渺小。但牠卻帶給孩子們多少歡喜和雀躍。</p>
<p>當月明皎潔，掛在中天的時候，當　星燦爛的時候。你也許忽視了流螢的存在，也許你看見了牠，但你卻鄙視著牠的渺小和微弱的光亮，但是當星月全無的晚上，卻能顯出牠的可貴來了。</p>
<p>流螢卻不管道些，牠飛翔，牠用自己微弱的光輝，給黑夜的整體，劃上許多碎小的漏洞。</p>
<p>並不誇大官己，企求完成「唯我獨尊」的　感，並不卑視自己，藐賤自己的低能。有一痊先驅者說過：「有一分光，發一分熱。」流螢完成了生活的充實和工作的意義。</p>
<p>傷逝</p>
<p>新月，蛾眉似的，使人聯想起聖者臉上的光輝，想起孩子們無邪的面孔。</p>
<p>月光，像淡淡的羽紗，覆蓋了人世的　囂。是靜穆的，柔和的，但她卻用多情的手，為每一個多夢的人，開啟著記憶的宮門。</p>
<p>逝去的歲月，好像是一　采素白而且美麗的花朵，綻放在遼遠的可望而不及的地方。遠隔在山的那邊，水的彼岸的朋友，使我抽出一縷卷戀的長絲……這些，對於我，就好像和月夜有不可割離的血緣，因為，我惋惜那「長串在月下所扮演的故事，我想起如烟的往昔，我想起了那跟流星一樣散失在不可知的地方的伴侶。…………</p>
<p>是誰？在林子的那邊，唱起了一雙歌。</p>
<p>我有一個美麗的幻夢。</p>
<p>遺落在流星的身旁……</p>
<p>…………………………</p>
<p>…………………………</p>
<p>在今夜，妳是否仍站在窗前，讓那如水的月華，溶入妳海樣深湛的眸子裹？</p>
<p>在今夜，一股冷森森的憂悒，摻和著新月的光芒，悄悄地從我底心的深處流過……。</p>
<h3>小憩</h3>
<p>— 塞尚</p>
<p>塞尚（Paul　Cezanne　1839—1906）是十九世紀著名的畫家，是現代繪晝的開山鼻祖，然而他是一個從未入過美術學根而全憑自修出來的人。生性孤僻而傲慢，除左拉（Emilezola）之外，他很少有看得起的人。</p>
<p>他否認印象派為「光」所奴役的主張，他以主觀的態度進一步描寫光以外的「物」的質和量。所作人物，靜物，風景均有，但以靜物為最著。此作為成熟期人物畫之代表作。</p>

<p>初次在朦朧的月光下瞧著她，一張長圓形的臉孔如擦上奶油似的雪白。梳著二根短鍍的辮子，揮著一柄六角形的扇子，看見我，笑了，跟著她六十歲的美國「Grandma」，走過來：「Wellcome！」。是細而溫柔的馨香。</p>
<p>多面熟！似曾相識，卻又記不起來了。冒失地握住她的小手問著：「你認識我嗎？」</p>
<p>「當然認識！你的大名是否呌x××？」</p>
<p>「是喲！你怎麼會認識我呢？」</p>
<p>「在莫干山；在蘇州；還在許多刊物雜誌上，……」</p>
<p>「哦！……」</p>
<p>我愧然地臉紅了。我能不嗎！這個天真的女孩子，說是認識我。認識我的窮困？認識我的迂頑？還是認識我的…………？…</p>
<p>垂下頭，我啞然無言。</p>
<p>「派對」開始，那女孩子低低地唱起來了。的聲音，先是輕柔；繼則嘹亮；最後，像一枝飛箭直衝天空，又飛快地顫抖著落下來；於是整個天地和月亮都似乎變色了！</p>
<p>歸途，我與我的朋友討論著那女孩子。</p>
<p>「真了不得！這女孩將來出國回來一走是個大歌唱家！」我的朋友興奮地說。</p>
<p>「是的，也許。」我回答。</p>
<p>「她又長得如此漂亮，真像一頭美麗的小黃鶯！」我的朋友又說。</p>
<p>「是的，她很漂亮。但她不是一頭美麗的小黃鶯，而是一朵美麗的康乃馨！」我說。</p>
<p>「為什麼如此固執呢？」我的朋友笑了：「小黃鶯，康乃馨，小鳥和鮮花，不是同樣的可愛嗎？有何分別呢？」</p>
<p>我輕輕地回答我的朋友：</p>
<p>「有分別，小鳥翱翔於自由的高空，為自己的快樂高歌，為自己的喜悅歡舞。鮮花，永遠生機於污濕的泥土，抓攙於弄花者的手掌。你羨慕新娘手中一束高貴的康乃馨嗎！衣你去看看那很　縛於他們後面的堅　的鉛　！」</p>
<p>說著我莫名地　了口氣，於是我的朋友也默然了。</p>
<p>狗</p>
<p>不知是否因為大家呌他「阿狗」，他的身體　的漸漸像了一頭狗。</p>
<p>頭類向下彎著，觀骨聳著，兩望殘缺不整的耳染，古怪地捲了攏來。背脊上隆起一塊高高的東西，鄰家一位會做詩的少爺看見了，喊著：「可怕的斬頭呀，緊壓於他瘦弱的背脊上！」</p>
<p>可是阿狗什麼都不懂得，他愧恐地抬起頭，問著：「少爺！今天花圈裏還要拔草嗎？」</p>
<p>阿狗啞哽難聽的聲音把少爺的「詩意」趕鉋了，生氣起來，一揮手：「我不知道，你去問太太！」</p>
<p>太太說是要的，阿狗高興得跳起來，高興得好此上帝允許他：「你再可以活一天！」</p>
<p>於是阿狗笑了，他帶著愉快的微笑到花園裏去拔草。</p>
<p>我也笑了，我帶著淡淡的苦笑到樓窗口去看他拔草。</p>
<p>我看見粗硬的野草深深地長在泥土裏，阿狗哼晴哼晴地用力拔著。……</p>
<p>我看見如火的烈陽高掛在天空中，阿狗背脊上的汗珠如雨淋一樣流著。……</p>
<p>我看見花園的門突然開了，一個穿洋裝的小孩和一雙髦毛的哈叭狗跳了進來。「喔喔喔喔…」哈叭狗向阿狗直衝過去，要咬他。</p>
<p>「小少爺……」阿狗急得直喊。</p>
<p>「哈哈哈！」是小少爺一串爽期的笑聲。</p>
<p>阿狗逃著，哈叭狗追著，小少爺在後面拍手跟著。</p>
<p>他們逃得太快，追得太快，也跟得太快。在強烈的太陽光裏，漸漸看不清楚了！只見三圍白沉沉的東西，在花園裏飛快　轉動著……</p>
<p>「到底那一雙是狗　？」我在我的樓窗口問著自己。</p>
<p>「到底那一隻是狗呢？」我到今天還在問著自己。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「唉！」耀君好像心口被人重重槌了一下似的；普通少女，第一次發規了失戀的證據，也沒有她這時如此的失意，難受</p>
<p>「那不能怪你。「我趕緊安慰她：「獵部知這你盡了最大的努力：換句話說，就認鶴見或W先生，和你易地而處，也大概只能辦到這個地步，也許遠及不到。」</p>
<p>「……」耀　嘴唇顫動著，想設什麼，卻不曾說出口。</p>
<p>「你知道我從來不說假話，也從來不愛奉承人，……假話對你無益，反要誤事……反正現在我趕來了，旁的也許我辦不到，電訊一項，担保迅捷——你知道，我昨大已經交換了四五次消息了。」</p>
<p>「怪不得您一來就要交換情報，我還當是您要知道昨天晚上的一點經過……原來我的報告都給郵電兩局壓下去了，就是打仗，也不應壓得那們慢，真是意想不到……算到昨晚為止，少說也有十次重要報告——郵電兩種——我認為那是　安常的方式。」　　精神已經恢復了好些了，可沒有剛才那樣高興。</p>
<p>耀　接著把已送出的報告，揀最重要的，發了幾條，我一面聽一面記下。耀　說畢，我把記下的幾條，重又複閱一過，並且徵求了耀　的同意，便招呼大傻子「〇四」，呌他把這些消息，用我們當用密碼，送到北平東京，兩個秘密站，又呌他加上一條，說明我和耀　等人，已經見面；其餘　上再說。「〇四」臨走，我呌小老虎指引他去找要的車子，十二點以前趙到這裏，多弄些吃的東西帶來——我預備跟耀　鼎元暢談一番，然計劃進行工作。</p>
<p>小老虎和大傻子一同走了出去；可是不多幾分鐘，小老虎忽又折回；我以為他忘了什麼，或有什麼話要問。正瞧著他，只見他一對圓眼，　了兩　，便笑著告訴我們：「申隊長說，他知道那條路．也知道停車地點的那顆大樹，所以……」</p>
<p>耀　聽了，嗤地一笑。我察顏觀色，知道這小東西不老實，一定在撒謊。事實上卻也怪他不得。他絕對不是偷懶，卻是因我們都在這裏，他有些　不得走開；一部分想聽我們談話，一部分，就是小孩的本性，哥歡趁熱鬧。為了這兩點，大概他把路徑和停車地點告訴了大傻子，呌他自己去找；但又怕我和耀　怪他，所以拿大傻子來頂鍋蓋。</p>
<p>「很好」，耀　瞧了瞧手　，對小老虎說：「現在快八點了，本來我約會那個買沙夫說話，現在勞你駕跑一趟，上辦公處招呼他一聲，就說我不得　，下午五六點鐘呌他再來。要是他還沒到，可以知會老龍，呌他代說一聲。……去了就來。」</p>
<p>滬濱絮語</p>
<h3>上海人過夏天</h3>
<p>— 十郎</p>
<p>讀了「紐約人過廈天」，使人感慨萬分。</p>
<p>許多人憧憬著上海生活的豪華，冷氣，冷飲·西瓜·冰箱，誰不漠然？談住，有花園洋房；談玩兒，有高貴的舞廳；談喫，有富　舒適的餐座；……但是，這些只是豪門富家少數人的作樂亨受罷了。</p>
<p>紐約人到了百把度的「大伏天」，全家到海灘上去玩兒個痛快；那裏不分老少，不分貴賤，在這個「夏季歇業」的天氣裏，在碧浪滔滔，細沙如茵，海灘邊消磨幾個黃昏，怎麼不暑氣全消呢？</p>
<p>但是　　上海人，不要說海灘淤泳，就是能上游泳池的，能佔上海人的幾分之幾？</p>
<p>有些人，每天連洗汗臭的地方都沒有，臉盆那樣大的盆子，擦擦洗洗，已經算是「應了景」；什慶「洋磁盆「」運蓬頭」的設備，不是他們所取想像的。</p>
<p>而一到晚上，像用火炙燒過的「鴿子籠」，把他們緊策到馬路上來；他們除了在當風的處所，亨受一點晚風以外，他們能到那裏去度過這個酷熱蒸悶的長夜呢？</p>
<p>尤其是那些苦力，車夫，汗流浹背的在碼頭上，扛著重負，拉著車子，挑著重擔，讓一百度左右的太陽，晒焦了他們的皮膚，而那些生水的病菌的冷飲，肖著「死亡」的手，在向他們招搖！</p>
<p>這個炙熱無情的火　，在燒著三百多萬苦惱的上海人，在他們頭上，在他們腳下，在他們週圍，都是火一樣的熱氣呵！</p>
<p>時疫，急症，追踪著他們，襲擊著他們，他們在這些熱火中燒的夏天，他們己經失去抵拒的能力。</p>
<p>你可想像得到柏油熬得飛滾的馬路上，那些赤足的苦力和人力車夫，他們怎樣在那上面飛奔吧？</p>
<p>上海人怎樣過夏天，你是不能想像於萬一的。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<p>人物誌</p>
<h3>張嘉璈佳話錄</h3>
<p>— 孟龍</p>
<p>我之知道張嘉　，遠在廿年以前，那時他彷佛還是一個從商者的姿態，名字也不以「嘉　」二字聞於世，大家都稱呼他「公權先生」。大約魷因為這個緣故，有人戲稱「公權」為商名，而把「嘉　」認為是官名。實際上，這是一而二，二而一，這就等於在教育部做　事官的時候叫「周樹人」（「豫才」），在寫文章的時候叫「魯訊」一樣，其間並無官民政商之分，也無神秘性的存在。</p>
<p>但張嘉　自有其神秘的一面。據一個朋友告訴我：他有不少特殊的愛癖，為了符合他的愛癖，家庭中的佈置顯得非常別緻。譬如你走進他的會客室，你可能體認出他是一個赫然有名的金融家的趣味。以前，多少年前已經記不清了，有一個朋友曾替他設計了一種美妙的地毯，它的式樣與花紋，正與中國銀行的五元鈔票票面圖案一樣，示撾在面積上放大一百倍而已。們若由一個近視眼看起來，簡直會誤認這塊地毯是一張丟落在地板上的鈔票哩</p>
<p>關於他的婚事，社會上也風傳了許多富於神秘色彩的傳說。據我所知，自從抗戰軍興，張嘉　即隨國軍內移，為祖國效勞，對經濟抗戰工作，頗博各方的好許。其時，他的家眷，連夫人陳女士在內，都留著不走，卻還是住在高恩路的一所相當華　的公館裏。當時一般人都推測：張太太已隨張氐西遷，實在是出於幻想，不過因為她足不出戶，與外界極少往來，故未為人們所覺察罷了。最不幸的，是在前年，病魔奪去了她的生命，張嘉　的愴痛不言可知。陳女士系出名門，是前清上海聞人陳百萬的女公子。在他倆結婚時，上海城內外曾轟傳一時，並且說陳女土妝　之豐，竟多至「十八尊羅漢」云云，這雖非事實，但豪華的情形確是可以由此推想其一斑。</p>
<p>續　問題，原是張嘉　日夕考慮的事。此次周碧霞與張氏聯姻，可設是一段舊象新訂，是一段相思債的　償。新夫人碧霞女土擅於社交，此次由平飛滬，下機時不肯拋頭露面，反以扇子遮臉，央行盧秘書且從勞辯護，說她不是張夫人而是朱太太，因此許多人被弄得摸不著頭腦，也有許多人以為張夫人怕羞，怕人家說起白　紅顏的趣話，或者梨花海棠的　括，其實，讀者大可不必為她擔心，她在交際界頗負盛名，與張氏兩胞妹尤有莫逆之交，她與張氏相識，已有數年歷史。去年曾一度喧佈她們在滬秘書成婚的傳說，但旋即說實其為不確。總這這些薄說，在張周結婚過程中。平添了不少神秘色彩，主要的不是因為「白　紅顏」，而是因為張先生是從政治者的原故，而怕影響記者的包　吧。</p>
<h3>頭髮的生長</h3>
<p>— 東方荊</p>
<p>人類一坐下來就有頭髮，直到死去仍把它帶到棺材裏。可是，在主與死之間，人們對於頭髮的知識，卻少得可憐。這實在是一種不可原諒的無知。</p>
<p>胎兒在誕生前六個月，就開始長頭發了。直到心臟停止了跳動，頭髮才停止生長。傳說死人的頭髮也能生長，賓是一種誤解，因為那是死人肌肉組織收縮，以致誤認為頭發仍在生長。</p>
<p>陽光對於頭髮的構造和數量，並沒有關係，剪髮剃頭，對於頭髮的生長，也沒有影響。</p>
<p>頭髮的顏色是由一種色素所決定，這種色素是人類身體自行製成，存儲在髮根中。體內色素產量減少，　使得頭髮逐慚變成灰白。個別的頭變並不褪色，不過在它們脫落以後，再生出來的頭髮，所含的色素減少。</p>
<p>未老先白頭，往往由於下列三種原因：（一）身體內的頭髮色素不足；（二）嚴重的神經系疾病，包括過份的憂慮，焦急等；（三）患傷寒，　疾等症。</p>
<p>現在，　學還沒有辦法使人體內能夠生產足夠的色素，維他命治療或其他醫學方法，都沒有效驗。</p>
<p>古人說，「怒髮衝完」，我們都不過認為是文字的形容詞吧了。不過，事賣上，頭髮是能夠一根根直豎起來的，在我們受了極大驚駭，和寒冷的時候，頭髮就豎直起來。</p>
<p>頭髮的拉力很大，一根頭髮能修弔住四分之一磅的重量。同時，頭髮是有彈性的。它可以拉長五分之一，並且和橡皮筋一樣，能夠縮回去。據試駝，濕潤的頭髮能夠拉長百分之七十而不斷，在蒸氣和滾水中，頭髮可以拉長一倍。</p>
<p>頭髮剛從頭皮　出來的時候，生長得最快，平均一個月可以長四分之三吋。以後就生長得慢了。頭髮的壽命約為六個月到四年，不過頸髮脫落之後，立刻有一根新的頭髮長出，即使把頭髮連根拔掉，也仍有新的頭髮生出來，不過得要六個星期到十二個星期，方能長出來。</p>
<p>如果你想染髮，最好三思而行。皮膚學家認為，任何染料對於頭髮都是有損害的，將使頭髮去天然的光澤。至於燙髮，除了對理髮師以外，也是有損無益的。</p>
<p>假使在大病以後，頭髮脫落，沒有關係，一旦體力完全復原，頭髮仍舊會長出來的。</p>
<p>保持頭髮健康的辦法約有四種：（一）多梳；（二）多摩擦頭皮；（三）常洗頭，保持頭皮清潔；（四）避免情緒上的陣礙。</p>
<h3>大有出入</h3>
<p>— 葛春良</p>
<p>鄧太太和何太太已經好幾個月沒有遇見了，「我聽見說，」鄧太太說：「你的兒子和你的女兒都已結婚了，恭喜恭喜！」</p>
<p>「謝謝你，」何太太說。</p>
<p>「你的女兒好嗎？她現在近況怎樣？」</p>
<p>「非常的好，」何太太回答說，「她有了一個很好，很體貼的丈夫，每天她在床上吃早飯的，隨便什慶事連一只手指都不用動一動的，每天下午，吃過飯去買買東西，回來後便打打牌，她真是一個有福氣的女人。」</p>
<p>「那麼，你兒子呢？」鄧太太繼續問。</p>
<p>何太太　著氣說：「唉，我的兒子，這孩子真可憐，我怕他近況不很好呢，他的妻子真懶惰，天生的懶惰坯子。她每天要睡到十點鐘才肯起身呢，並且屋中隨便什麼事，她動也不肯動一動的，每天下午，總是大半天的在打牌。唉，鄧太太，她真是一個懶惰的賤坯呀！」</p>
<h3>梁祖與好大柳樹</h3>
<p>— 又今</p>
<p>聽慣了諛詔之言的人，諍言是聽不進的；可是「良藥苦心利於病，忠言逆耳利於行」的道理，分明擺在那裏是很清楚的。</p>
<p>齊國鄒忌自知他的相貌不及城北徐公的美然而他的妻私於他，他的妾是於他，他的朋友有求於他，都一律捧他，說他比城北徐公更美。這使得鄒忌恍然於蒙蔽之為害，張於以此勸說齊王，使齊五能樂受真言，不為　詔之言所蒙蔽。齊國也因此「戰勝於朝廷」。這是最好的正例。</p>
<p>大凡善於逢迎的人，都不明大義；明大義的人類多不喜歡別人的逢迎。歷史上忠奸之別，只在肯直言與不有直言這一點上判得分朋。</p>
<p>明鄭瑄昨非庵日纂中有這樣一則小故事：</p>
<p>「梁祖思求直言之士，一日，忽也　高柳樹下，樹可數　。</p>
<p>梁祖獨語曰：好大柳橋！偏視實客久之，客各避席，對曰：好大柳樹！祖又曰：大可作車頭，末座數人起對：好作車頭。祖厲聲曰：柳樹豈可作車頭！秦時指鹿為為，有甚難事！悉撲殺言作車頭者。吁！　以殺身，逢迎何益！」</p>
<p>這裏面所述的那些循聲而答，有加鸚鵡學舌的賓客，其性質大約有兩稱；一種是拚命拍馬，以唯唯諾諾為忠實，希聲邀寵，唯恐忤逆意志的。一種是庸庸碌碌，一如寒蟾噤罵，雖然心知其非，卻又訥訥不能出於口，只好跟著說「好大柳樹」和「好作車頭」。</p>
<p>然而指鹿為馬，其罪唯　。梁祖一律撲殺，固然足以　戒　訣，但未免有默故入人罪，假如真是要人家直言敢揀，何不公開的說：「你們不要再做以前一樣的專門附和，應該說出你們的真心話來」。我想賓客中必定有人敢說柳榭不可以作車頭的。為什麼徒然樹成，以表永自已的好殺成性呢？梁祖這樣作風是錯得簡直不可以理喻了。</p>
<p>「長君之惡其罪小，逢君之惡共罪大」。跟在梁宜後面附和作應聲蟲，一律撲殺，固然也不見得十分冤枉但為求直言之士，竟採如此手段，實夜呌後世人不敢恭維。</p>
<p>質正的民主，應該像柳下風來一樣的和氣為先，自己設「好大柳榭」和「大可作車頭」，以　引賓客上當，加以殺戮，這是一種戾氣，結果，直言之士是必然無處可求的了。</p>
<h3>夫婦之間</h3>
<p>— 明森</p>
<p>經濟問題——E．D．毛勒研究過四百六十六件離婚案，他發見其中有百分之三十至四十件的主因是經濟困難。可是G．V．漢密　登，卻在他所著的「婚姻之研究」中提出了另一種解釋法：對於金錢的爭論，往住只是結婚生活上的其他　本不協綢的表徵。</p>
<p>婚後不樂的女人，常要尋找口實來發揮她的不滿意。她絕不肯想到她自己或許有什麼過失；她只是吹毛求疵地尋覓她丈夫的缺點。而用經濟問題來跟他嚕囌，是最近便的口實之一。</p>
<p>身體不好——如果是真的時，這可算是最易理解的使嬸女們呶呶不己的原因。許多女人把她們的牢騷保留著，直到她們的月經期來到時，就不顧一切地發作一番或幾番。有些婦女托辭疾病，以規避她們所厭惡的性生活，或作為她們不善做家主婦的　辭。當感到身體不適的時候，呶呶不休的女人深信她有十足的權利來發一些牢騷。</p>
<p>端納·賴特提供的取得夫婦間幸福的簡單原則是：「表示出親愛之情來！表示出賞識之心來！」學習寬容別人，及其思想，欲望，和生活方式。</p>
<p>科學小品</p>
<h3>蟑螂的奇妙生活（上）</h3>
<p>— 天虹</p>
<p>仔細研究有史以前的動物化石的「古生物學者」，時常會看到他們非常熟悉的一種小動物——蟑螂——印征上面的痕跡。生活於古生代「石炭紀」的無數動物，從那龐大可怖的「恐龍」起，得以生存至今的，只有蟑螂一種。它經歷了二萬一千六百萬年的大變遷和災難，不但仍舊存在著，而且幾乎一點沒有改燮或進化。</p>
<p>一般人都覺得蟑螂是一種齷齪可厭的東西，償於到我們家裏來做不速之客。討厭地分享我們的飲食和宿舍。可是讓我們為它說一句公道話吧：它是一種非常聰明靈妙的小動物——全靠它自己的智力，才得勝過了恐龍和有史以前的巨大動物而繁衍到現在。它是昆蟲界的老前輩；在生活之道上，它甚至可給我捫人類多種教訓。</p>
<p>使得蟑螂繼續生存了二萬萬餘年的秘訣，第一是它的性生活是賢明地有節制的。多數昆蟲，在成長後都繼續不斷從事於求偶和生殖，消耗了全部的精力。蟑螂並不如此。它僅在春天交配。它的後嗣一誕生，它就為它們做一個窩，　愛地照顧它們，直到它們能獨自生活。</p>
<p>至少在有一點上，蟑螂的生活之道是優於人類：它們絕不自相爭們。卻懂得尊重別的同類的權利。如果一窩蟑螂己成家立業於某一個角落裏，別的蟑螂就不會侵犯進去。它們更不會因爭奪美味的食物而互相殘殺。</p>
<p>蟑螂一點也不講究吃食；它無論什麼都會吃的。牆壁上的粉泥啊，破碎的舊皮鞋和硬紙盒啊，石膏石灰啊，藥物啊……都列在它可以接受的食品單上。甚至對於墨水·油布·和破爛的布頭，它也會高與得有如見了肉，麵包，和馬鈴薯一般。有時侯，似乎為了新奇，它會在你睡覺時偷偷地溜到你身上來，　食你的睫毛和指甲。</p>
<p>而逢到不景氣的時候，蟑螂可以什麼也不吃，有一個科學家曾把一　蟑螂悶在一個大瓶子裏，不給它們一點飲食；過了七十六天以後，它們仍舊活著。當他放它們出來時，它們餓得非常衰弱，全身　明了！可是它們並不立刻大嚼，暴食，以致吃死自己；在釋放出來的最初幾天內，它們僅稍稍吃一些食物，直到它們的消化力恢復常態時，才逐漸增加其食量。</p>
<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>美國學校的經費來源</p>
<p>以文化悠久為世界見稱的中國，教育似乎已到了破產的關頭，學校為了經費短絀，勢必提高學費。一般窮苦學生迫得在街頭乞求助學金，真符合了「斯文掃地」的說法。在這種環境中求學，未免自討苦吃。美國的學校，建築不及中國學校宏巍，教職員沒有中國學校那麼多，他們除認真辦學外，對於政鬥黨爭不很感到興趣，更不願把學校當做戰場。美國私立學校得不到政府很多幫助。但也有充沛的經費，可並不是由學生沿途乞募而來的，卻是由富翁富翁捐助為多。美國自實施所得稅及遣產稅以後，對於財富不啻一大打擊，富豪為避免重稅，寗可把大部財產，捐諸學校，一方可以逃稅，一方可以享名，比無聲無臭的繳入國庫要光榮得多了。所以像噞佛等等著名大學，校產之富，冠於世界，再用一百年也用不了。在曉市頓有一所Rice　Instihte，是一個煤油大王捐的，地廣數千英畝，學生完全免費，還有津貼，不過錄取水準極高，這是高材生的大學，混文憑的人不得其門而入的。德士省立在學也是富於校產著名，而德士省為煤汕產地，許多平民因為牧場上開出油礦，頓時由赤貧成為巨商，把錢看得很輕，捐數萬萬美金不算一會事。美國人卻有一種怪脾氣，寗可把全部財產捐给學校，却不給自己的子孫做牛馬。東方人剛剛相反，上海有許多大王，矢天啃大餅油條过活，儿女却在舞場賭場揮霍無度。教育當局如果能在這方面動動腦筋，省得許多學生在列炎中流汗　涕。（三）（一）</p>

<h3>Approved by the Joint Committee Review: Postponing the Opening of Trade with Japan; To Be Submitted to the Political Affairs Conference Today for a Final Decision</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 28th] The issue of opening trade with Japan, which has been attracting attention from all sides, was discussed at the National Economic Commission's subcommittee meeting on the morning of the 28th. It was decided to comply with public opinion and postpone the opening. The dispatch of a commercial delegation to Japan will also be postponed. This is indeed a major victory for public opinion. Today's meeting was convened by Wang Yunwu, with Chen Qitian, Wu Yunchu, and others in attendance. During the meeting, Chen Qitian advocated that public opinion should be heeded and reconsidered. Wu Yunchu also spoke on behalf of the business community, hoping that the authorities would take public opinion seriously. Other committee members also agreed that it was necessary to postpone the matter for further discussion. A decision was made to postpone the handling of the matter. This reporter made a special visit to Mr. Chen Qitian regarding this matter, and he provided the following key points of the review committee's decision: (1) The opening of private trade with Japan was initiated by the United Nations Far Eastern Commission and the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in Japan. Our government should adopt a reserved attitude in diplomatic procedures. (2) The dispatch of a Chinese private commercial delegation to Japan will be temporarily postponed, adopting the suggestions of the Senate Standing Committee and the opinions of business leaders. (3) The barter trade with Japan, managed by government commercial representatives (including business with cash settlements), will continue. (4) If businesses have goods for import and export with Japan, they can temporarily entrust them to government commercial representatives. The above review opinions will be submitted to the Political Affairs Conference on the 29th for a final decision.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 28th] Wu Yunchu, Chairman of the Industrial Association and member of the National Economic Commission, told reporters after the adjournment of the National Economic Commission's subcommittee meeting on the afternoon of the 28th that he was pleased that the subcommittee had complied with public opinion and suspended the opening of trade with Japan.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Dispatch from Tokyo, 28th] The Japanese Trade Bureau recently announced that in the first six months of this year, China accounted for 11% of Japan's total exports. The quantity of goods exported to the United States was only one-quarter of that in the same period last year. In the same period last year, goods exported to the United States accounted for 70% of the total, while this year it was only 18%. This year, exports to Korea accounted for 16% of the total, the United Kingdom 10%, Hong Kong 7.8%, Turkey 4%, Siam 2%, Burma 1.9%, and Sweden 1.8%. Among Japan's exports, cotton textiles accounted for 33%, metals 7%, coal 6%, machinery 5.9%, fertilizer 3%, yarn 27%, and porcelain 51%. Among imports, food was the most abundant, accounting for 51%, gasoline 14%, fertilizer 12%, used machinery 7%, salt 6%, cotton 5%, rubber 2%, and the remainder consisted of pig iron, ramie, minerals, and coking coal.</p>
<h3>General Wedemeyer Successfully Concludes Mission and Returns to the Capital; Numerous Materials Obtained During Two Days in Shanghai; Engineering Advisor Discusses Changes in Detail with Minister of Communications Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] General Wedemeyer and the entire investigation team that came to Shanghai returned to the capital by special plane at 10:00 AM yesterday from Jiangwan Airport. Mayor Wu's representative Zhang Bide, Director Wei Jingmeng of the Shanghai Office of the Information Bureau, and Director Connaught of the United States Information Service all saw them off at the airport. The investigation team's news advisor, Watson, expressed deep gratitude for the assistance of the local press. After returning to the capital, General Wedemeyer may go to Peiping at the end of the month, but he may also first go to Qingdao this Thursday to inspect the naval base. Furthermore, according to observations by qualified individuals in this city, General Wedemeyer's visit to Shanghai was mainly to inquire about the wishes of American businessmen in China after the United States provides economic aid to China, in addition to understanding China's financial and commercial strength.</p>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Nanjing, 28th] General Wedemeyer and his party returned to the capital at 11:30 AM today and will spend several days here organizing the information they have collected. Members of his delegation will also hold individual meetings and conduct independent investigations in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 28th] After General Wedemeyer and his party returned to the capital, they had lunch with Ambassador Stuart and Philip D. Reed at the Shanghai Road residence this afternoon. The three had a very pleasant conversation. After a short rest and handling official business, General Wedemeyer, accompanied by an engineering advisor, Rear Admiral Drexel, and news advisor Watson, attended a banquet at Premier Zhang Qun's residence at 8:00 PM. Ambassador Stuart and Fu Jingbo were also invited to attend. According to Watson, they will leave the capital for Qingdao, Peiping, and Tianjin at the end of this week or early next week for inspection. Trips to Changchun and Taiwan will depend on the situation and time. There are currently no plans to go to Soviet-occupied areas such as Lushun and Dalian. Watson said that China is a very large country, and their schedule is too tight. It is difficult to conduct investigations in all areas and to gain in-depth understanding everywhere. Therefore, the method of conducting their work will be to first summarize, analyze, compare, and study the materials obtained from the outside world, and then make independent judgments based on what they have personally heard and seen.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 28th] The U.S. Embassy issued a written statement today, announcing that General Wedemeyer and his delegation returned to Nanjing on the morning of the 28th after a busy two-day stay in Shanghai. During these two days, they obtained a significant amount of information, some from Chinese officials and business leaders (the list was published daily in the communiqués issued by General Wedemeyer's temporary office in Shanghai), some detailed reports prepared in advance by U.S. Consul General Davis in Shanghai and his consular staff, and some reports from individuals in Shanghai's American business community. The statement stated: "Additional valuable information continues to be submitted to the delegation from other sources. One source is delivered by individuals familiar with various issues in China, and some members of the delegation will automatically visit these individuals. Another source comes from individuals in various regions and professions who voluntarily and out of patriotic zeal wish to provide information and suggestions to General Wedemeyer's delegation." The statement continued: "Due to the collection of information from various sources, a large amount of information has been collected in the first week of General Wedemeyer's delegation's visit to China. General Wedemeyer and his advisors will spend most of their time this week comparing and studying the existing and continuously received data reports." The embassy also reiterated that the delegation's primary purpose remains to investigate the facts, as it has been in the past.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 28th] Various advisors of the Wedemeyer delegation have begun individual meetings with various parties.

<h3>Central Executive Committee Holds Extraordinary Meeting; Issues of Kuomintang Members Running for National Assembly and Legislative Yuan Seats; Two Hours of Discussion Leads to the Formation of Five Committees for Joint Study</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 28th] The Central Executive Committee held an extraordinary meeting at 10:00 AM on the 28th to discuss the issue of Kuomintang members participating in the elections for the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan.

Another extraordinary meeting will be held in three days to make a decision.</p>
<h3>Special Envoy Wedemeyer's Mission Here is to Study the Methods of Assisting China; Zhang Junmai States After Visiting General Wedemeyer</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhang Junmai, Chairman of the China Democratic Socialist Party, issued the following statement after visiting General Wedemeyer: "General Wedemeyer's words and attitude made people deeply feel his overflowing friendship, broad-mindedness, and lack of prejudice. In addition to hoping that visitors would provide information and suggestions, he also requested frank criticism of current U.S. policies. It was rumored that General Wedemeyer's visit was to investigate whether China was worthy of assistance and that he would support Japan to replace our country if necessary. After my meeting with General Wedemeyer, I believe that this statement is completely inaccurate. General Wedemeyer's visit is actually to study which method is most effective in assisting China's revival. As for the opinions I contributed to General Wedemeyer, in addition to the general practical situation, they are roughly as follows: In the political aspect, I advocate thoroughly implementing the constitution to transform politics and improve efficiency. The current low level of political efficiency is not a personnel problem, but a problem of the entire system. In the economic aspect, I hope to restore stability as soon as possible. In the military aspect, I advocate improving the quality of the military and emphasizing quality over quantity. General Wedemeyer quite agreed with this point." When asked by reporters whether the central government had accepted the suggestion of reforming local politics, Zhang said: "I have suggested to the government to increase the power of the provinces, so as to avoid the need to go through the central government for everything. It takes time and effort to implement official documents. This point has been approved by the Chairman and is only waiting for actual implementation. As for the proportion of various parties in universal suffrage, Zhang acknowledged that the issue of three-one-one is generally no longer a problem and can be officially announced after the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee approves it."</p>

<h3>Requisitioning Private Foreign Deposits: Limited to Facts, Unable to Force; Hoping that Citizens Will Voluntarily Declare and Await Use</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 28th] American businessmen in Shanghai believe that before the United States loans money to China, China should first use private deposits in the United States worth 500 million U.S. dollars to ensure that China is doing its best to help itself. When related parties here commented on this matter on the 28th, they first pointed out that although China relies on foreign aid in the process of revival, it has never given up on self-reliance. Premier Zhang implied this to the people as soon as he took office and is working in this direction.</p>
<p>Intended to Requisition Loans from British and American Banks During the War but Failed</p>
<p>As for the use of private deposits in the United States, our government intended to requisition loans during the war and once drafted "Measures for Requisitioning and Lending People's Foreign Exchange Assets," which was transferred by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the British and American governments for assistance. The British banking community stated that bank depositors' names are not marked with nationality, and the amount of each account should be kept confidential. Disclosing depositors' assets would violate the trust and inevitably affect London's position as an international financial center, and insisted on opposing it. The United States also responded in the same way. After the war ended, the British and American governments successively announced the lifting of the seizure order, and this matter became increasingly impossible to handle. After the promulgation of the Emergency Economic Measures in February of this year, the British and American governments were consulted again, and the British and American embassies in China replied on March 10th and 14th of this year that the British and American governments still could not provide depositors' names. In the past, the U.S. government, in order to facilitate the seizure of foreigners' deposits, once investigated the assets of various countries in the United States in 1941, but it never officially disclosed them to the public. Our government has no way of knowing the details, and this information must have changed since the United States announced the lifting of the seizure, and it is no longer usable. Therefore, the government can only hope that the people will voluntarily declare to the Ministry of Finance and will draft "Measures for the Registration and Declaration of Foreign Exchange Assets of Citizens of the Republic of China Abroad." The government's issuance of U.S. dollar bonds also stipulates that people can purchase them with U.S. dollar deposits. Later, someone suggested purchasing machinery in the United States with foreign deposits, providing special convenience. The purpose of all this is to encourage private individuals to use foreign deposits to help domestic construction. The economic reform plan recently approved by the National Economic Commission also stipulates that "Citizens' assets abroad should be declared within a limited time and properly utilized," which shows that our government has always been paying attention to the use of private deposits in the United States. Part of this matter depends on the patriotism of the people, but it also depends on the assistance of friendly countries. Furthermore, it is rumored that our private deposits in the United States amount to 500 million U.S. dollars. According to reliable estimates, the total amount is only 350 million U.S. dollars.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] During the Thirty-Sixth Annual Land Tax Conference, supervisors Xiang Naiqi, He Hanwen, Wang Shuhui, Bai Rui, Li Zhengle, Ma Yaonan, Shi Ying, Yu Fen, Wang Zixian, and others from the Control Yuan suggested three improvements to the land tax collection method. It is said that the problem with land tax collection is not the excessive tax rate, but the unequal burden, especially since the implementation of land reporting. Due to poor planning and inadequate techniques, the burden on the people has become increasingly uneven, with the light burden becoming lighter and the heavy burden becoming heavier. Moreover, those with lighter burdens are often wealthy and powerful landlords, while those with heavier burdens are mostly small landowners, self-cultivators, and lower-middle-class farmers. Therefore, in recent years, land has become increasingly concentrated, and the number of people losing their livelihoods has been increasing, which runs counter to the policy of equalizing land ownership and supporting independent farmers. They proposed three minimum improvements: (1) According to the land report from Hunan, the fertile areas by the lake are divided into three grades and nine classes for taxation, while the barren areas are divided into two grades and six classes. This reflects the beautiful intention of regulating surplus and deficiency. However, in reality, in the fertile counties, the land of the highest grade is taxed at only about five jiao per mu, and the tax decreases successively. The average tax rate for the three grades and nine classes is no more than five jiao for the heavier taxed land and about three jiao for the lighter taxed land. In the barren counties, the land of the highest grade is taxed at more than eight jiao per mu, such as in Yuanling. In other counties, it is also more than seven jiao. Although the top three grades are nominally exempted, the average tax rate for the remaining two grades and six classes is more than seven jiao for the heavier taxed land and about six jiao for the lighter taxed land. In order to equalize the burden between counties, all counties with an average tax rate exceeding five jiao per mu should be reduced to five jiao, and the total amount should be recalculated and redistributed according to the grade of the county. (2) China's land tax collection has combined the regular tax and surcharges into one, with a tax rate of four dou per yuan, which is about 15% of the net income. In order to equalize the burden between individuals, any taxpayer whose tax payment exceeds 20% of their net income may apply to the Land Management Office for a reduction to 15%. However, they must declare that if any unmeasured land is discovered, the unmeasured land will be confiscated, and they will be severely punished. At the same time, the Land Management Office will investigate wealthy and powerful families. If their tax payment is less than 10% of their net income, their land tax may be increased to 15%, and an investigation may be conducted to determine if there are any unmeasured lands. The specific investigation methods will be determined separately. (3) China's agricultural stage has not yet overcome nature and is still dominated by natural forces. When determining the grade of land, the tax burden should not exceed the land's productivity. Before achieving technical accuracy and fair evaluation, the principle of "better to be cautious than to be bold" should be followed. It is better to err on the side of leniency than on the side of severity, because storing wealth among the people is ultimately beneficial to the country.</p>

<h3>Communist Bandits Fiercely Attack Linqu with 100,000 Troops; National Army Defends Resolutely Amidst Bloody Situation; Recapture Machang and Qingxian on the Northern Section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 28th] The battle for Linqu is becoming increasingly fierce. Starting on the evening of the 27th, the Communist bandits increased from five columns to seven, totaling over 100,000 troops, and launched a fierce attack on all sides of the city walls. The intensity of the battle is unprecedented. By dawn on the 28th, the north and south gates had been breached by the bandits. As of the time of this dispatch, fierce hand-to-hand combat is still ongoing in the streets.

Wang Yaowu has praised their firm fighting spirit and morale and issued a commendation order. Furthermore, Mount Jushan, which overlooks the entire city from Likexu Village in the east of Linqu City, is also still being firmly defended by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Linyi Dispatch, 28th] As of the evening of the 28th, the situation in Linqu is unclear.</p>

<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 28th] The National Army in the western Hebei mountainous area is advancing westward in a rapid offensive. The two groups of troops moving west from Wangdu and Dingxian met at Quyang yesterday afternoon, turned south, and attacked the Communist bandits' old nest in the western mountainous area of Xingtang. The overall battle situation is now one-sided, with the bandits avoiding battle and fleeing in disarray, and the National Army pursuing relentlessly. Furthermore, the encircling army moving north from Shijiazhuang is rapidly advancing along the Hutuo River, attacking into Pingshan territory. The National Army forces from the north and south are echoing each other and launching a pincer attack, and Gaocheng will soon be recaptured.

<h3>National Army Division Commander Yang Gancai Firmly Defends Teng County; Defeats Communist Bandits Four Times His Number</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 28th] National Army Division Commander Yang Gancai, who firmly defended Teng County, led a single brigade and fought fiercely for seven days and nights, defeating Communist bandits four times his number, creating a turning point for victory in the Shandong war situation. The government authorities, in recognition of his brave fighting, awarded him a bonus of 300 million yuan. The division's Chief of Staff, Major General Ren Jingxiu, recently came to Xuzhou on official business and spoke to reporters about the seven-day defense of Teng County and his post-war review. He first stated: The Communist bandits launched a full-scale attack on Teng County, and their slogans were: "(1) Take Teng County to welcome the upcoming major counter-offensive. (2) Strive to become a hero who enters the city in the future. (3) Find a way to take Teng County and make great contributions." This proves that the Communist bandits were eager to recapture the momentum lost in the Yishan mountainous area and were eager to capture the city. Their attack on Teng County was mainly carried out by a part of the Fifth Column with more than 40,000 troops. On the 12th, they fled northwest and first engaged in fierce battles with the National Army defense units in Dongshahe and Nanshahe outside Teng County. On the 14th, they began to attack the city. From the evening of the 14th to the 17th, they hid during the day and launched fierce attacks on the four gates at night, with the 17th being the most intense. On the morning of the 18th, their Second Division moved northeast, attempting to prevent National Army reinforcements, while the remaining forces continued to attack the city. On the afternoon of the 19th, the Fourth Column was reinforced from the Zouxian area. By the evening of the 20th, the Communist bandits' offensive had subsided slightly due to heavy casualties, and reinforcements from various National Army routes had arrived one after another. Before dawn on the 21st, the Communist bandits fled northeast. In the seven-day battle, although the Communist bandits had several times entered the city walls, they were all driven back. In total, the Communist bandits suffered casualties of 18,000 to 20,000, with over 200 captured and over 200 surrendering voluntarily. The National Army's losses were less than one-seventh of that. Ren also said: The factors contributing to this victory were: (1) The soldiers fought bravely, with strong determination, strict command and supervision, and unity from top to bottom. (2) Correct judgment of the enemy's situation and thorough preparation. (3) The strong defense of outposts outside the city formed a mutually supportive relationship with the defending troops inside the city. (4) The political workers and the people of the People's Service Corps cooperated with the army in combat, creating harmony between the military and the civilians. (5) Strong artillery firepower and complete defense facilities. Ren concluded by saying: The Communist bandits lacked ammunition and food, their morale was low, and the people were no longer willing to be used by them. This was the main reason for the Communist bandits' defeat.</p>
<h3>National Army Northeast of Xinxian Destroys Secret Underground Caves</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 27th] The National Army in Xinxian recently launched a mopping-up operation and destroyed three secret underground caves used by Communist bandits in Xiacaocaozhang, about 30 li northeast of the city, crushing the enemy's treacherous activities. Xiacaocaozhang is located at the intersection of Xinxian and Dingxiang counties. Communist bandits often hide in underground caves there and ambush the National Army. On the 18th, the National Army went to carry out a mopping-up operation. Most of the bandits fled upon hearing the news. The secret underground caves were discovered after a thorough investigation by the National Army and were immediately destroyed. One of the caves was located in the Sanfo Temple in the village, five chi high and three cun wide, extending for twelve li, connecting to Gaocun. The middle cave was located under the Niangniang Temple in the village, eight li long, connecting to Daiye. One cave was located south of the village, marked with a "soul-leading" sign and a false epitaph. The cave was more than eight li long, communicating with Lantaigou in Dingxiang.

<h3>New Soldiers in Various Counties of Yunnan Join the Ranks; Kang Province Requests Reduction of Recruitment Quota</h3>
<p>[Our Kunming Dispatch, 28th] Yunnan's recruitment quota for the 36th year is 14,000 men. The Ministry of National Defense has ordered that the quota be filled by the end of September, pending dispatch. The new soldier battalions of the Yunnan Military Region have already departed and are heading to various counties to receive new soldiers and distribute them to various districts for training.</p>
<p>[Our Ya'an Dispatch, 28th] The assigned troop levy for Kang Province is 2,700 men, to be completed within three months. The provincial authorities believe that the situation of the Tibetan and Qiang ethnic groups in Kang Province is special, making it difficult to levy troops. The quota only applies to the Han Chinese, whose total population is one million. After deducting the elderly, weak, women, and children, the number of able-bodied men of conscription age is limited, making it difficult to fulfill the predetermined levy. Furthermore, it is currently the busy farming season, making it even more difficult to collect troops as scheduled.

<h3>Methods for Compiling Electoral Rolls for National Assembly Representatives and Legislative Yuan Members; Election General Office Provides Clarification</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Various parties have requested the Election General Office to clarify how to compile electoral rolls for National Assembly Representatives and Legislative Yuan members. The Office recently issued the following clarification on this point:</p>
<p>(1) For regional elections of National Assembly Representatives, the competent election authorities (county and city election offices, or county-administered city election offices) shall prepare two copies each of the electoral roll for each electoral district, recording the name, gender, age, place of origin, occupation, and address of each voter, as well as whether or not they have the right to be elected. This shall be completed forty days before the election and publicly announced. The aforementioned period of forty days may be advanced by fifteen days, totaling fifty-five days, according to practical needs. At the same time, one copy of the roll shall be submitted to the superior election authority for record, and the total number of voters shall be forwarded to the Election General Office for record. Electoral rolls for Legislative Yuan members shall be completed and publicly announced fifty days before the election, and may be advanced by fifteen days, totaling sixty-five days. The electoral roll may be made on ten-line paper to ensure uniformity. The preparation of electoral rolls for Mongolian, Tibetan, and overseas Chinese shall be the same as for regional elections.</p>
<p>(2) The preparation and reporting date of electoral rolls for National Assembly representatives of occupational and women's groups and Legislative Yuan members of occupational groups shall be the same as for regional elections. However, the competent election authorities for National Assembly representatives of each occupational and women's group and Legislative Yuan members of occupational groups shall first notify each group to prepare a clear list recording the following items ninety days before the election to serve as the basis for determining the qualifications of voters: 1. Organizational charter, establishment procedure, and its process. 2. Registration authority and date of registration. 3. Staff and their experience. 4. Member's name, gender, age, place of origin, address, and length of time engaged in the occupation. 5. The names of other groups in which members are also members, and a statement of which group they have chosen to participate in the election.</p>
<p>(3) In the frontier areas (Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Hunan), the competent authorities shall prepare separate electoral rolls for each ethnic group in each area who meet the voter requirements. The preparation and announcement date shall be the same as for regional elections. However, the election ballots shall be manufactured based on the electoral rolls, counted separately, and a list shall be compiled after the public announcement, with the number of votes received noted and reported to the superior election authority for tabulation and public announcement.</p>
<p>(4) For citizens with special living habits in the interior (i.e., Hui Muslims living in various places), the competent authorities shall prepare separate electoral rolls for each area where the Hui Muslims meet the voter requirements. The date shall be the same as for regional elections. The election ballots shall be counted separately, and after the public announcement, a list shall be compiled, with the number of votes received noted and forwarded to the Election General Office for tabulation and public announcement.</p>
<h3>Question of Women's Place of Origin in Elections</h3>
<p>Election General Office also Provides Clarification</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The Election General Office has clarified whether women should participate in elections based on their registered domicile or their original domicile. It is stated that Article 16, Paragraph 2, of the Enforcement Regulations of the Law on the Election and Recall of National Assembly Representatives, and Article 15, Paragraph 2, of the Enforcement Regulations of the Law on the Election and Recall of Legislative Yuan Members, stipulate that women who have not yet registered their domicile due to marriage or divorce may still apply to register as candidates for election in their original domicile. Therefore, women who are married but have not yet registered their domicile in their husband's domicile may participate in the election in their original domicile. If they have already registered their domicile in their husband's domicile, they may choose to participate in the election in either their registered domicile or their original domicile.</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan's Two Committees Pass Sino-British Air Transport Agreement at Review Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The Sino-British Air Transport Agreement was reviewed and passed by the Economic and Foreign Affairs Committees of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 28th and will be ratified when the Legislative Yuan reconvenes. Today's review meeting was presided over by Dai Xiujun, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and attended by more than thirty committee members. Dai Xiujun first gave a report, and then the review began. Most committee members expressed dissatisfaction with the British side's use of Hong Kong as the starting point for the air route, believing that the British side clearly regards Hong Kong as its territory. Dai explained that the British side strongly argued for this during the negotiations, but the current regulations have been revised significantly compared to the British side's original proposal, and it is unlikely to create difficulties for our future recovery of Hong Kong. The case has been reviewed at the meeting, and it has been decided to handle it flexibly, allowing it to be signed in advance and then ratified after the Legislative Yuan reconvenes.</p>
<h3>Heads of Provincial and Municipal Election Offices to be Concurrently Held by Chairmen and Mayors; National Government Has Issued Orders and Announced the List</h3>

The list is as follows:</p>

<h3>Famous Southern Product Lychee Ripe; Fuzhou Market Price 3-4,000 Yuan per Catty; to be Transported North by Special Plane for Sale in Beijing and Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 28th] Lychee, a fine fruit product from the south, is now ripe. There are those who have negotiated to charter planes to transport lychees to Beijing and Shanghai for sale. The market price here was 6,000 yuan per catty when it first ripened, and has recently gradually dropped to 3-4,000 yuan. Many old mansions and residences in the Rongcheng area have lychee trees planted in their gardens. At this time, they are laden with fruit, with thousands upon thousands of them, evenly distributed like crimson pearls, tempting people over the walls, causing their mouths to water. The ancient temple Xichan Temple in the western suburbs of the city also has many fine varieties planted, with small seeds, thick flesh, lots of juice, and a sweet taste, which are popular among the people. According to past practice, each tourist could pay a certain incense fee and enjoy eating as much as they liked. This practice has been abolished this year, and the value is measured. Gluttons feel disappointed. Lychee, also known as "Lizi" or "Danli," belongs to the Sapindaceae family. China is rich in lychees, especially in Fujian and Guangdong. The tree is an evergreen tree, up to two or three zhang tall, with lush, overlapping leaves, shaped like a canopy. The leaves are pinnately compound. The fruit sets in June, is round, larger than a pigeon egg, and has scaly skin. When ripe, it is completely red. The tree is afraid of frost and snow and is suitable for planting in subtropical or warm-temperate zones. If the west wind blows during flowering, it will not easily set fruit. It is most忌scented musk, which will cause all the flowers and fruits to fall. Putian, Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou in Fujian are all major producing areas. The variety from Putian is the best. The fruit is easy to rot and is not suitable for long journeys. Fruit farmers mostly make lychee dried fruit, which is sold throughout the country. People regard it as a tonic and always like to eat it. Before the war, Fujian Province produced 30,000 dan per year, which, at the current price of 3,000 yuan per catty, would be 9 billion yuan. However, production and sales have declined sharply since the victory. Last year, only more than 4,000 dan were produced. The production this year is relatively abundant, but the north is currently at war, making foreign sales difficult. Furthermore, there is a fierce and stubborn pest of lychee called "chunky-like," which is very harmful every year. The previous method of changing the location of bird nests is now being tested using its "natural enemy," the parasitoid wasp, and parasitic bacteria to eliminate it, which has been successful and will be applied in practice.</p>
<h3>Beiping Uncovers a Fake Kidnapping Case; Complicated Case with Seven Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] An intricate fake kidnapping case has been uncovered in the ancient city, and seven people have been arrested. The ringleader, Han Shouguang, falsely claimed to be a lieutenant general advisor of the Ping-Han Railway Protection Headquarters. Two accomplices, Jiang Bohua and Guo Zanliang, claimed to be reporters for the Minyu News Agency (which the agency has now denied). Another ringleader, Gao Guoying, graduated from Nagasaki High School in Japan. The entire case involves many more people and is currently under development. On the 18th of this month, Zhang Huimin was invited by his friend Sun Bochuan to discuss something. When he arrived at Sun's house, he was told that Sun was out and had not returned. When Zhang was returning, he was kidnapped by two worker-like people onto a car, blindfolded, and taken to the ringleader Han's house. The next day, he was dressed in military uniform, falsely set up a court, and told that Zhang was colluding with the Communist Party and smuggling military supplies. Three days later, Sun Bochuan, who originally invited Zhang to talk, suddenly told Zhang that he had been kidnapped and interrogated by "Advisor Han" in the same situation a few days ago (Zhang also knew that this had happened, but it was a planned disguise), and his son-in-law Gao Guoying had run around to release him. Zhang could be released if he produced fifty gold bars, so Zhang turned to Sun to ask his son-in-law to intercede. As a result, Zhang was released with a check for 10 million yuan and told not to publicize it. Until the 27th, because he recognized Sun's daughter (Gao's fiancée) and Sun's daughter-in-law who went to the silver shop to withdraw money, he aroused suspicion, and the seven accomplices were arrested by the Inspection Office, and the whole case was revealed.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Measures Should Be Taken Regarding Trade with Japan</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of opening private trade with Japan, after the Supervisory Committee member Wan Can and others proposed that the government postpone the opening and advocated stopping the dispatch of business investigation groups to Japan, our newspaper's editorial on the 21st echoed this sentiment, stating strongly that as the issue of Japanese reparations has not been resolved and a peace treaty with Japan has not been signed, hastily opening Sino-Japanese private trade would do more harm than good to our country's actual interests. Recently, the Shanghai business community has unanimously advocated that the opening of trade with Japan should be discussed slowly to avoid repeating the mistakes of economic aggression before the war. National Assembly members Zheng Kuiyi and others proposed "requesting the government to postpone the opening of trade with Japan before signing a peace treaty with Japan," and Xue Mingjian and others proposed "planning to request the government to postpone the opening of trade with Japan." These proposals were debated and established at the plenary review meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly on the 26th. Two methods were decided and sent to the government for handling: (1) Request the government to postpone the opening of private trade with Japan before the peace treaty is signed; (2) In order to achieve temporary mutual assistance with Japan, the past barter trade methods with Japan can be improved or expanded. We believe that the National Assembly's proposal is correct. The deadline of August 15th is approaching in an instant. The government should quickly announce its decision to inform the public and dispel doubts.</p>
<p>International trade, like normal exchanges between countries, is naturally neither supported nor opposed in today's world economy's prosperity and development. Regarding the opening of trade with Japan, the public and business community's opinion is to advocate for a time-based reservation, waiting for Japanese reparations to be determined and a peace treaty to be signed before restoring normal private trade relations. In the current transition period, for mutual assistance, the barter trade conducted by the Central Trust Bureau with Japan can be widened in scope and improved or expanded in method. There is no need to wait for the opening of private trade with Japan. This view of the National Assembly members and the business community is far-sighted and reasonable. From any point of view, restoring Sino-Japanese private trade at this time only benefits Japan unilaterally and the interests of a small number of merchants, which is actually harmful and not beneficial to the country and the nation. Our country's issue has reached the time for the government to choose. The authorities in charge of foreign trade should consider the interests of the country and the future of our country's industry, and should not make overly hasty decisions.</p>
<p>Looking at Japanese newspapers and magazines, the Katayama government and private trade associations have formulated various ambitious plans for the opening of trade, and regard the restoration of overseas trade as the starting point for Japan's industrial recovery. They even hope to obtain a $1 billion loan from the United States through this. The so-called obligation of war reparations has long been put out of their minds and is not asked or discussed. Especially Japanese private merchants, upon hearing that MacArthur's headquarters will open private trade on August 15th, are all happily telling each other the good news. They are organizing groups to go to China, Nanyang, Taiwan, and the Northeast after August 15th. In their minds, they all believe that the opportunity for revival has arrived, and Japan's good fortune to rise again has arrived. If we hastily restore Sino-Japanese private trade under this situation, we will not only fall into the trap of "industrial Japan and agricultural China," but also weaken our speaking position in the formal peace conference. If we unfortunately take this step, then we will have won the victory on the battlefield after eight years of resistance, but we will encounter defeat at the conference table. This is a major event that concerns our country's century-old national plan, national integrity, and international reputation, and it must be carefully observed and carefully considered!</p>
<p>So-called private trade is ordinary free trade, and the opening of private trade is the restoration of free trade. This is a major event related to the vitality of a country's economic lifeline. According to general practice, the restoration of private trade should be based on a treaty of commerce, stipulating tariff rates, merchant ship activities, smuggling returns, or exchange rates, etc., under the principle of equality and mutual benefit. Now that China and Japan are in a state of non-diplomatic relations and a peace treaty has not been signed, a treaty of commerce cannot be signed, and it is impossible to establish private trade. At this time, if we seek temporary mutual assistance, the two countries' "barter trade" method is a reasonable transitional method. However, if it is deemed necessary, it can naturally be improved or expanded. The so-called "barter trade" is trade conducted between governments, which is different in nature from ordinary free private trade and is not bound by any treaty of commerce. Since our country's victory, trade with Japan has been conducted in the form of "barter trade." From last year to the present, Japan's exports to China include logs, railroad ties, rayon, white paper, and locomotives. Rayon alone had a total value of $1,187,967.00 in 1936, and a total value of $1,538,498.19 from January to May of this year. Our country's exports to Japan include salt, wheat bran, pig iron, and phosphates. Salt alone had a total value of $4,349,032.50 in 1936, and a total value of $1,732,465.00 from January to May of this year. Recently, in order to expand trade, the Central Trust Bureau has reached an agreement with MacArthur's headquarters to export 25,000 metric tons of sugar to Japan this year, with a total value of more than $15 million. This shows that the Sino-Japanese barter trade policy is progressing well and has expanded the scope of exchange. If the scope of barter trade is further expanded and improved, it is believed that Sino-Japanese trade before the determination of Japanese reparations and the signing of a peace treaty will not be difficult to implement. We hope that the government will weigh the pros and cons and accept public opinion to make this reasonable and wise decision. It must not blindly drink poison to quench thirst, let alone sharpen the executioner's knife to slaughter its own industry.</p>
<p>However, trade with Japan will inevitably return to normal sooner or later. Therefore, we hope that the government and the business community will broaden their horizons and seize the opportunity to make full preparations before the peace conference is held. Whether it is research and investigation or group action, we should strive to take the initiative in order to be invincible. In particular, our trade policy for the Nanyang market should focus on this. Some people are now advocating amending the international trade system, which is also worth considering. In short, our trade policy should be proactive. Especially for trade with Japan, we need to have prepared and methodical measures, and we must not repeat the situation of panic and lack of responsive measures today.</p>
<h3>Order! Law and Discipline!</h3>
<p>Late the day before yesterday, military police and police officers of this city clashed in front of the Jindu Grand Theater over a trivial matter, even using machine guns, causing an unprecedented bloody incident in the city streets. More than a dozen police officers and citizens were killed and injured. When citizens of the entire city saw this shocking news in the newspapers, they all expressed great regret for this unfortunate incident and hoped for an immediate legal solution. However, some police officers actually went on strike yesterday. Fortunately, volunteer police and inspection brigades performed their duties in their place. Otherwise, the city's traffic and public security might have fallen into a state of chaos. Only by evening did they gradually resume their posts. However, yesterday afternoon, the internal equipment of the Jindu Grand Theater was suddenly destroyed, and citizens suffered unexpected losses for no reason. We have three thoughts regarding this unfortunate incident:</p>
<p>First, whether it is the police or the military police, they all represent the state in maintaining local order. Not only is their task important, but their status is also important, so they should be respected by the people. However, in the unfortunate incident that occurred the night before, those who originally intended to maintain order for the theater ended up mutually hindering order, causing panic among the people. Regardless of the cause, the conflict between the police and military police, not in the pursuit of bandits, but actually using machine guns to sweep the streets as if facing a major enemy, is ultimately a phenomenon that people who respect the rule of law are unwilling to see. After the incident, the police and military police authorities researched the cause of the incident. It is said that it was due to the lack of clear division of authority between the police and military police. If the rumor is not groundless, this matter should be quietly awaited for the central government to deal with it according to its wishes. Neither side should take any further action to cause unexpected losses to the citizens. Therefore, we want to ask the police officers who went on strike to fully understand the location of their duties, and should especially focus on local peace and traffic order, fully restore normalcy today, and stay at their posts.</p>
<p>Second, since the victory, the maintenance of public security and order in Shanghai has relied on the efforts of police officers. Although the number of consolation visits from all walks of life in the city during the Spring Festival and the Dragon Boat Festival was not large, it was enough to express the citizens' gratitude to the police and military police. Regardless of how the police and military police seek to divide their limits and how they seek to harmonize their feelings, the first priority should be to respect military law and discipline and maintain order, and to take into account the safety of the people, which is the overall goal of all their work. Local events, the central and local heads in charge, definitely have the necessary responsibility to deal with it according to the law. The unexpected damage suffered by the innocent people should be compensated by the government with responsibility.</p>
<p>Third, Shanghai is China's largest commercial port, and the attention of China and foreign countries is close. The actions of both the government and the people are enough to affect China's reputation and international status. The unfortunate incident the night before cannot but be said to be one of Shanghai's blemishes. We often call for order and law and discipline, and the government also wants everyone to abide by order and law and discipline, but the phenomenon is like this! However, speaking calmly, the formation of this phenomenon does not seem to be the result of one day or two, nor is it unique to the police and military police. Looking around, the facts of obstructing order and destroying law and discipline in society every day are unknown. Over time, it will almost make people feel that "not obeying order is the norm, and respecting law and discipline is the exception," which is a matter of great concern. Therefore, we are willing to speak loudly, not avoiding harsh words, calling on the government and society to learn a lesson from one example and draw inferences about other cases, and everyone to thoroughly reflect, abide by order, and respect law and discipline. All right and wrong should be judged fairly and selflessly before the law!</p>

<h3>Nehru Decides to Refer the Dutch-Indonesian Dispute to the United Nations for Arbitration; Prior Understanding Has Been Reached with the United Kingdom and the United States</h3>
<p>[Our News] Guangqiao, New Delhi, 28th: Nehru announced at a special press conference today that within a few hours, he will formally submit the Dutch-Indonesian dispute to the United Nations, requesting the United Nations to immediately stop the Dutch military action in Indonesia. Nehru stated that he had consulted with the United Kingdom and the United States in advance regarding this matter and obtained their sympathy and assistance. Nehru strongly stated that foreign troops must withdraw from Asia. According to reports, the existence of colonial regimes or foreign troops in any Asian country is a direct challenge to Asia. The continued existence of colonies not only threatens peace but also prevents the recovery of the world economy, Nehru claimed in extremely heavy tones. The Dutch's so-called "guard" action is actually a large-scale organized war.</p>
<p>[Our News] London Broadcasting, 28th: Deputy Chairman of the Dutch-Indonesian Provisional Government Nehru decided to submit the Dutch-Indonesian issue to the United Nations on Tuesday. Nehru also announced a ban on Dutch aircraft landing in India and flying over Indian airspace.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Chicago, 28th Dispatch] The Chicago Tribune, the most widely circulated newspaper in the United States, published an editorial today criticizing the United Nations' failure to intervene in the Indonesian issue. It stated that the United States seems to be less able than Asians to recognize obvious facts, which is a noteworthy phenomenon. The announcement that the traditional principles of the United States should also apply to Asia has actually come from Nehru. American officials now seem unable to speak for the most basic principles of justice.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Canberra, 28th Dispatch] Australian officials stated today that Australia hopes that the Indonesian issue will be resolved in accordance with international plans, but a formal attitude can only be determined after diplomatic efforts have failed. Australia is currently intensifying diplomatic contacts with the United Kingdom, the United States, the Netherlands, and India to seek a peaceful resolution to the Indonesian conflict.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 27th Dispatch] The Sunday Observer reported today that the United Kingdom will dissuade Australia and India from submitting the Indonesian issue to the United Nations Security Council for discussion. The United Kingdom believes that this action is a waste of time and will be fruitless.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Singapore, 28th Dispatch] An Indonesian army spokesperson stated at the radio review bureau that the Dutch have deployed four divisions and two brigades in the battle of Java, all equipped with new equipment. Indonesia has now begun underground resistance, and many Dutch soldiers have defected with weapons. According to the Republican Gazette, the Indonesian army is advancing eastward to attack San Seron, and the Dutch army is resisting with all its might. The Dutch deployed aircraft and tanks, and used warships to provide artillery support. The Republican Gazette acknowledged that the Tegel Port on the north coast has been occupied by the Dutch army. Fierce battles have also taken place in Shirawi, ten miles south of Tegel.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting in Eastern Java Unfinished</p>
<p>The Gazette further stated that the fierce fighting in eastern Java has not ended. Eight hundred Dutch troops, under the cover of armored vehicles, attacked Sha Huabo Ladong, southeast of Surabaya, and were repelled by the Republican army. The Dutch army attacked Suji, west of Surabaya, yesterday, and the Republican army brigade counterattacked with artillery cover. Dutch warships shelled Griss, ten miles southwest of Surabaya.

The Dutch Eastern Route Army Command predicted that Indonesia could be conquered within a week, but so far, only a few cities have been occupied, and whether they can be maintained is also questionable.</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 27th Dispatch] The Dutch Military Report today announced that the Dutch army has intensified its pressure on western Java, and other troops have rapidly expanded their bridgeheads on the north coast, occupying Tegel Port, 175 miles southeast of Batavia.

<h3>Indonesian Army Scorch Earth Resistance; Oil Fields in Dutch-Occupied Areas Are on Fire</h3>
<p>[United Press, Sumatra Front, 27th Dispatch] The gasoline pool of the Mobil Company in the local area of Bondo Popo was occupied by the Dutch army three days ago and was not damaged. However, it suddenly caught fire and burned, with thick smoke reaching the sky, reaching 4,500 feet, and spreading 50 miles wide. According to a report from the station manager, the oil wells have not yet caught fire, but most of the oil depots are on fire. The most dangerous thing at present is the tortuous small ditch, which is full of gasoline.</p>
<p>[United Press, Palembang, Sumatra, 27th Dispatch] American gasoline industry technicians following the advancing Dutch army arrived at the Mobil gasoline company's oil fields in southern Sumatra on the 26th and worked hard to put out the fire on the 27th. The arsonists are believed to be the saboteurs on the Indonesian side. According to Dutch Air Force officials, according to a report from Dutch reconnaissance aircraft on the 26th, no fire occurred in the oil field area, so the arsonists must be people from the Indonesian side who often sneak into the area at night.</p>
<h3>Heavy Losses; Difficult to Recover</h3>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 27th Dispatch] The Indonesian News Agency announced tonight that the Dutch army used tanks and aircraft to cut off western Java. If it attempts to occupy the area, the Farm and Forestry Union will implement a scorched-earth policy and set fire to all 500 rubber, quinquina, tea, and coffee farms. According to a senior official of the union, once destroyed, if the Dutch want to restore production, they must send 500,000 workers from their own country and operate for more than ten years before they can be effective. "We will not allow the Dutch to harbor the delusion of maintaining the integrity of agriculture and forestry."</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 28th Dispatch] The Dutch military headquarters announced today that the Dutch army in eastern Sumatra has occupied Bato Raja, a wealthy oil-producing area 80 miles southwest of Huhu Port, and the essential coal mine of Bukit Tessa, 20 miles southwest of it, intact and without resistance. The oil field staff stayed behind and were well-behaved towards the Dutch army. When the Indonesian army retreated from Sekajou, about 60 miles northwest of Huge Port, it burned several villages along the way to the ground.</p>
<h3>Dutch Currency Black Market Price Soars</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Singapore, 28th Dispatch] Local Chinese merchants expect that after the Dutch take military action in Java, prosperity can be restored, and in the newly occupied areas by the Dutch army, Dutch Gilders can replace Indonesian banknotes and Japanese military tickets. For this reason, the black market price of Gilders here has suddenly soared. Millions of Indonesian banknotes were smuggled from Java to Singapore by Chinese merchants. The official price is eight Malayan dollars per hundred, and the city once rose to eleven.</p>

<h3>Our Consulate General Intensifies Efforts to Protect Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Dutch Troops Rescue Captured Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 28th Dispatch] Diplomatic circles' news: Following the outbreak of the Dutch East Indies Incident, military actions have intensified daily, and news between Batavia and the inland areas has been cut off.

<h3>America Refreshes Diplomatic Lineup to Prepare for Diplomatic Warfare Against the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington 27th United Press Dispatch] The United States is preparing to launch a diplomatic war for peace against the Soviet Union. Secretary of State Marshall is currently reorganizing the American diplomatic lineup, eliminating incompetent officials. The number of those appointed for political reasons is unprecedentedly small. Those appointed as diplomats are all career diplomats who have served in important places around the world. The United States will have the strongest diplomatic network in history in the Balkans, Central Europe, and Sweden. In the Middle East, the American diplomatic lineup has already been strengthened. In the areas of China and France, there will be slight changes soon. Marshall is solving this problem with the tactics of the past. He seeks to surround the Soviet Union with the most talented field commanders. This work has not yet been completed, but it is already underway.</p>
<p>According to United Press's investigation, the age of the current American ambassadors and ministers is actually lighter than at any stage in recent times. There are also two tasks being carried out by Marshall within the State Department that are the same as those being carried out for the American diplomatic lineup abroad. The first is that the selection of senior officials within the State Department has been completed, most of whom are career diplomats; the second is the reorganization of the State Department, merging various secretariats, unifying intelligence work, and establishing personnel to formulate long-term plans. Marshall has put general career diplomats at ease, as they had previously thought that Marshall might appoint his former wartime comrades to senior diplomatic posts. According to United Press's statistics, there are a total of 64 American ambassadors and ministers stationed in countries in the Western Hemisphere, 24 in Europe, 12 in the Middle East and Africa, and 7 in the Far East and the Pacific. There are currently four vacancies, namely Iceland, Spain, Bulgaria, and Nicaragua. Among the ambassadors and ministers, 86 are career diplomats, 13 were appointed due to political connections, 4 were military appointees, and 6 were non-career diplomats but with special qualifications. Several of the non-career diplomats were appointed by the late President Roosevelt. The newly appointed non-career diplomats, but with special qualifications and facing arduous tasks, are Ambassador to the United Kingdom Douglas, Ambassador to India Grady, and Ambassador to Poland Griffiths. Marshall emphasizes the positions of all American envoys in Europe, especially those stationed in countries neighboring the Soviet Union. He now needs first-class diplomats to be dispatched to Sweden, because although Sweden is very peaceful, it is currently the best place to probe the Soviet Union. Marshall is now also strengthening the American diplomatic lineup in Berlin. As for the Balkans, United Nations problem expert Dinon has been appointed Ambassador to Yugoslavia. Former Director of the Office of Foreign Affairs of the US State Department, Jay Young, has arrived in Hungary, and former Minister to Hungary, Schoenfeld, has been transferred to Romania. Only Bulgaria is still without a senior American diplomat. Switzerland will also be succeeded as Minister by former Director of the Far East Department of the State Department, Tang Xuande. Although Fan has devoted most of his time to Far Eastern issues, he is generally regarded as one of the most insightful and capable talents in the American diplomatic corps.</p>
<h3>Forrestal Plans the Merger of the Army, Navy, and Air Force</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington 28th Dispatch] America's first Secretary of Defense Forrestal began on the 28th to accept the task of merging the Army, Navy, and Air Force under the new bill to unify the armed forces. The Department of Defense organization passed by Congress is only a blueprint, but the heads of the Army and Navy Departments are confident that Forrestal's strong courage will certainly make it all a reality. During Forrestal's planning of the merger, the three departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force will continue to operate as usual. A Navy Department spokesman said that the date of Forrestal's official swearing-in has not yet been determined. Forrestal's appointment is a guarantee that the Navy will never be taken over by the Army. According to the new law, the Army, Navy, and Air Force departments belong to Forrestal and are in equal positions. Each department has a minister, but only Forrestal is responsible to the cabinet.</p>
<h3>British-Soviet Trade Negotiations Finally Fail, Soviet Government Clarifies Position, Saying the British Side's Tough Attitude Caused the Breakdown</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Moscow 27th Dispatch] TASS News Agency recently issued an official communique explaining the reasons for the breakdown of British-Soviet trade negotiations, stating briefly that: the breakdown of British-Soviet trade negotiations should be attributed to the "tough" attitude of the United Kingdom. There are two reasons for the suspension of negotiations:</p>
<p>(1) The United Kingdom is unwilling to bear a definite obligation to supply the Soviet Union with railway tracks, trains, and other industrial products. Since the Soviet Union does not know whether the United Kingdom will fulfill its obligations, it is naturally unwilling to bear any obligations to the United Kingdom. (2) The Soviet Union requested a reduction of 0.2% in the excise tax on the funds lent to the Soviet Union by the United Kingdom in 1914, and requested repayment in installments over 15 years. This is the same convenience that the Soviet Union requested to obtain the same convenience recently given to France by the United Kingdom, but the British delegation refused. Subsequently, in order to hope to reach an agreement, the Soviet Union abandoned its request for repayment in installments, and only requested the United Kingdom to allow the Soviet Union to first pay half of it immediately, and the balance to be repaid within a certain period. The British delegation again stated that it could not accept it, and put forward a counter-proposal, advocating repayment of a quarter of the amount in installments. The Soviet government found this difficult to accept. Foreign news agencies issued a message on the 24th of this month stating that the breakdown of British-Soviet trade negotiations was due to differences of opinion on wheat prices. This statement is not true. The British and Soviet sides have already reached an agreement on wheat prices, which is lower than the wheat prices recently purchased by the United Kingdom from Argentina and the market prices of Canadian wheat.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of British Views</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London 27th Dispatch] Regarding the Soviet Union's accusation that the failure of British-Soviet trade negotiations was due to the tough attitude of the United Kingdom, British officials have not yet commented, but according to qualified sources: The failure of British-Soviet trade negotiations is the result of the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the Marshall Plan for European Recovery. Since the Soviet Union rejected Secretary of State Marshall's proposal, it had no choice but to transport its surplus goods that could be exported to Eastern European countries. Since the Soviet Union decided not to participate in the Marshall Plan for European Recovery, the wheat prices proposed by the Soviet Union and the nature of the various industrial equipment it requested the United Kingdom to supply have undergone significant changes. The failure of the negotiations seemed inevitable at that time.</p>
<h3>Marshall Receives Freedom Award</h3>
<p>[United Press New York 28th Dispatch] The Freedom Association announced today that this year's Freedom Award will be awarded to Secretary of State Marshall in commemoration of his aid to the European Recovery Program.

The winner of the 1946 award was Baruch, the designer of the Baruch Atomic Plan, which is the basis for American official policy.</p>
<h3>Australian Foreign Minister Again Meets MacArthur, Differing Opinions on Various Issues Regarding Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo 28th Dispatch] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt will issue a statement on the 30th regarding his discussions with MacArthur on the occupation of Japan and the Japanese peace treaty. It is expected that Evatt will emphasize the common interests between the United States and Australia and express agreement with the basic principles of the occupation policy. According to an Australian source close to Evatt, if the United States and Australia can have peace in this part of the world, and we live together in this area, even if there are differences between the United States, they will certainly be resolved. "There may be differences between the United States and Australia, but there have never been differences between MacArthur and Evatt." Evatt hosted a banquet on the evening of the 28th to entertain American military personnel serving in Australia, and Evatt also had an informal conversation with Australian reporters. Evatt met with MacArthur at his headquarters for two hours on the evening of the 27th, and an Allied Headquarters spokesman said that the meeting was extremely "harmonious" and they were completely in agreement. This was Evatt's first official meeting on his fact-finding visit to Japan. Although American and Australian officials and non-officials would agree, sources close to Evatt said that there were several major differences in their viewpoints.</p>

<h3>MacArthur's Headquarters Releases Report on the Occupation of Korea</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington 27th Dispatch] MacArthur released the April report on the occupation of Korea on the 27th, stating that: In order to accommodate the thousands of Korean refugees who flee into the American-occupied areas from the Soviet-occupied areas every day, seven relief centers have now been established in the American-occupied areas.

There are approximately 72,000 refugees currently residing in relief centers, and more than 410,000 residing elsewhere. The report also stated that Koreans have expressed deep concern about the recently completed decision of the US-Soviet Joint Commission on the political destiny of Korea. The report pointed out that greater administrative authority in public affairs in the American-occupied areas is gradually being transferred to Korean officials to execute, without waiting for the great powers to reach an agreement. American personnel will peacefully hand over all executive tasks, and the Korean people will handle state affairs themselves, with the occupying forces only in a supervisory position.</p>

<h3>French Peasant Girl Becomes a Saint, Repeatedly Encountered Miracles During Her Lifetime</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Vatican 27th Dispatch] A 19th-century French nun, who served in the monastery as a lowly servant for 40 years of her 70-year life, was canonized today by Pope Pius XII as Saint Caseline. She is the tenth, and also the last, person to be canonized by the Catholic Church this year. During Saint Caseline's lifetime, the Virgin Mary appeared to her three times, and many miracles were discovered thereafter.

<h3>French Left and Right Wings Face Strength Test, De Gaulle Publicly Condemns Communists</h3>
<p>[Reuters Liner City, France 27th Dispatch] General de Gaulle, leader of the French People's Rally, has taken another step in his movement to establish a strong democratic government and cooperate fully with the United States, attacking the French Communist Party head-on. Political figures believe that De Gaulle's increasingly open opposition to the French Communists is related to the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the discussions on the Marshall Plan for European Recovery. De Gaulle bluntly stated that the Soviet Union's policies were astonishing. De Gaulle is already the third French leader in the past 72 hours to express similar astonishment. Former French Prime Minister Reynaud warned on Friday that the choice between "war soon" and "US-Soviet compromise" is not far off. French Foreign Minister Bidault also stated yesterday that the international situation has reached a serious stage, and the French people generally believe that the international situation is currently full of danger. The fact that the National Assembly is not taking its usual summer recess proves this point. De Gaulle's harsh condemnation of the Communist Party and the Soviet Union's hegemony, while at the same time calling on all French people, including "those who have been obeying others until now", foreshadows that France is about to face a split, and the pro-Eastern and pro-Western factions will soon test their strength in reality. This internal strife will be accelerated by the deteriorating economic and financial situation. De Gaulle's visit to the Brittany region has caused a sensation far and wide, with people coming from as far as 300 miles to listen to his speech, which shows that this wartime leader is still deeply supported by the people.</p>
<p>Contents of De Gaulle's Speech</p>
<p>[Associated Press Liner 27th Dispatch] De Gaulle delivered a speech here today, accusing the Soviet Union of creating a world crisis and blaming the French Communist Party for following Moscow's lead. De Gaulle claimed that the Soviet Union has controlled 400 million people in neighboring countries of Spain, Turkey, and Italy, only 500 kilometers from France. The Soviet Union, with its military and economic pressure, and internal personnel colluding in response, has organized totalitarian regimes in Poland, Yugoslavia, Albania, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Prussia, and Saxony, and can manipulate the Czech Republic and Finland.</p>

This deadline expired at midnight today. Before midnight, American experts and journalists studying Lincoln's deeds gathered in the Library of Congress. When the clock struck twelve, Library Director Evans opened the safe and took out the precious documents. Cameras flashed at once, capturing this precious moment, and the experts began to review them, hoping to discover Lincoln's deeds that were still unknown to the outside world. The library was the apartment where Lincoln stayed when he was a member of Congress. The United States government also plans to photograph these documents and distribute them to the United Kingdom and other countries for joint study.</p>

<h3>Soviet Scientists Discover New Magnetic North Pole</h3>
<p>[United Press London 18th Dispatch] According to the Soviet Northern Sea Route Administration, which manages Arctic exploration and navigation, Soviet scientists have discovered a "polar region that cannot be reached by humans", and have studied it, and have also confirmed the existence of the second magnetic pole. The "polar region that cannot be reached by humans" was named by Canadian explorer Stefansson. The area is not affected by stars or geomagnetism, is the farthest from any settlement, and is the most difficult to reach from all parts of the Arctic.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Polar Institute at Cambridge University said that the area may be around 85 degrees north latitude, and between 130 degrees east longitude and 140 degrees west longitude. Soviet scientists did not precisely specify the position of the pole, but said that an expedition was sent to the area in 1941. According to the survey, the seabed in the "polar region that cannot be reached by humans" is 6,000 to 11,000 feet deep, rather than the previously assumed 21,340 feet. There are small pieces and running water between the big ice islands. This is consistent with previous assumptions. Many explorers have passed through the "polar region that cannot be reached by humans", but so far only the Soviet team has spent several months on the moving ice island, doing scientific research. At the same time, Soviet scientists claimed that the existence of the second magnetic pole has also been confirmed, but they have not announced its precise position.</p>
<h3>President Truman Loses Mother, Chairman Chiang Sends Telegram of Condolences</h3>

<p>[United Press Grandview City, Missouri 27th Dispatch] After President Truman's mother passed away at the age of 94, the funeral will be held at 3:00 p.m. today, presided over by Pastor Bowman of the Grandview City Methodist Church. The funeral will be held at Forest Hill Cemetery in Kansas City.</p>
<h3>Dynamics of the US Congress Under Republican Control</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] The Eightieth Congress of the United States concluded its first session today. Although the Congress's actions regarding foreign affairs were unremarkable, they surprised conservative Republicans and deeply rooted isolationists. Republican lawmakers, who gained control of Congress for the first time in sixteen years, were able to cut approximately $2.7 billion from President Truman's proposed $37 billion budget, largely allocated to domestic expenses. However, virtually all requests for US foreign programs were approved.</p>
<p>Bipartisan or non-partisan foreign policy continued to gain strength in this session. Republican leaders continued to urge the United States to take a more active role in world affairs. President Truman's policies and Secretary of State Marshall's proposed European economic recovery plan have become cornerstones of US foreign policy. Despite the existence of Republican policies and isolationist factions, the US Congress continued to support the expenditure of American funds overseas to strengthen democratic forces. However, Congress strived to ensure that US aid was conditional and to reduce any commitments President Truman sought to make.</p>
<p>Under Republican control for the past seven months, the US Congress has shown increasing suspicion of the Soviet Union, especially since Secretary Marshall's return from the Moscow Conference. It has also demonstrated fear of domestic and foreign communism. President Truman's request for Congress to allocate $400 million to prevent the spread of communism in Greece and Turkey was immediately met with a positive response from members of Congress. The $11 million needed to eliminate the Communist Party in the United States under the President's loyalty program was also approved without significant difficulty. Members of Congress continued to show some progress in their postwar worldviews.</p>
<p>Congress is now resolutely supporting Marshall's firm and humble attitude, and the policy of vigorously promoting postwar world reconstruction, regardless of whether the Soviet Union participates. Although Congress refused to accept a large number of European displaced persons into the United States over a four-year period, it allocated $75 million to alleviate Europe's needs.</p>
<p>Half of all proposals from the US State Department were accepted. However, the most serious blow it suffered was Congress's rejection of Secretary Marshall's request to establish permanent overseas intelligence operations. Congress only approved $12 million to fund foreign broadcasting and propaganda programs. According to congressional records, the United States has provided nearly $20 billion in aid to 59 countries worldwide over the past two years.</p>
<p>Another noteworthy fact about Congress is its great concern for European issues, while it has not discussed or made decisions on the major issue of China.</p>
<p>The major debate on the Marshall Plan in the next session of Congress will depend on developments in Europe. If the international situation becomes critical, Congress may reconvene before January. The biggest foreign issue the next session will face remains the Soviet Union, and the growing awareness that the world has divided into two spheres: the Soviet Union and the Western democracies.</p>
<p>The next Congress will also make a decision on the plan to standardize and cooperate on Pan-American armaments, which will be discussed at the Rio de Janeiro Conference on August 15th. Given Congress's anti-communist tendencies, the Western Hemisphere defense plan is likely to pass without any amendments.</p>
<h3>Serious British Economic Crisis: Articles Urging Prime Minister Attlee's Resignation Appear; British Prime Minister to Report on Governance</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 28th] The "Daily Mirror," known for its pro-socialist stance, published an editorial today calling for Prime Minister Attlee to resign, claiming that if he does not step down voluntarily, a majority of members of Parliament will force him out of office. This shows that the increasing economic crisis in Britain is causing widespread anxiety. At the same time, newspapers of various political persuasions, from the Communist Party to the Conservative Party, are criticizing the cabinet, with the exception of the Liberal Party's "Daily News Chronicle," though even it is not defending the government as strongly as in the past.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 27th] Prime Minister Attlee, at the request of Labour Party members, is scheduled to address a special closed-door meeting of Labour MPs on Wednesday to report on the progress of leading the country. Newspapers today published headlines warning from party leaders that Britain's coal shortage and the scarcity of other essential goods remain extremely serious. Unless a miracle occurs, the British people will suffer hunger and cold this winter, and perhaps for years to come. On the international front, Britain's influence has already withdrawn from India, Burma, and Greece, and it will have to further reduce its military strength and other burdens.</p>
<h3>Question of Organizing a Korean Provisional Government: The US Disagrees with Soviet Proposal; North Korean Refugees Fleeing into the US-Occupied Zone</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 28th] According to General Brown, the US-Soviet Joint Commission has encountered some difficulties because the Soviet side opposes including former members of the so-called Anti-Trusteeship Committee in the provisional government. The American representatives cannot agree to rescind the cooperation declaration, which would deny a portion of important figures representing Korean public opinion. Brown continued, stating that the opinion of the American delegation is that government belongs to the people, which means that it belongs to all the people and all political parties formed by the people. To deny a large number of people and the political parties that represent them the right to participate in the most important things they encounter in their lives, namely, not allowing them to participate in the formation of their government, would be unjust, which is something the American delegation cannot agree to.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 28th] US military commanders in Japan stated that Korea is a troublesome place in the East. Reporters understood this after arriving in Seoul, as communists are about to launch a revolution in the US-occupied zone. If this happens, US occupation forces will inevitably engage in war with the communists, and the outcome is unpredictable. This is why Lieutenant General Hodge, the commander of US occupation forces, does not encourage family members to come, and repeatedly tells his subordinates not to do so. In short, the Korean problem is how to return Korea to the Koreans to manage themselves, without it becoming a vassal state of the Soviet Union. Since the US and the Soviet Union separately occupied the north and south of Korea, no agreement has ever been reached on the Korean issue, resulting in a deadlock. It is rumored that the Soviet Union has organized North Korea into a vassal state, and has sent thousands of long-trained communists to infiltrate the US-occupied zone, in order to unite with 20,000 local comrades to incite incidents. In addition, "refugees" from the Soviet-occupied zone are fleeing into this area every day. The US military authorities now believe that these people are likely to incite revolution.</p>
<h3>Irgun Calls on Jews to Launch a Campaign of Disobedience; British Forces Continue to Intercept Jewish Immigrant Ships</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Jerusalem, 27th] The Jewish terrorist organization Irgun broadcasted today, calling on the Jewish people to launch a campaign of disobedience against the British authorities. The Irgun demands that the Jewish people take the following actions: (1) Refuse to pay taxes, (2) Refuse to recognize British courts and organize their own courts, (3) Treat British laws as invalid, (4) Break off all contact with the British authorities.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Haifa, 28th] The Jewish refugee ship "Return Home," carrying 400 unauthorized Jewish immigrants, has approached the port of Haifa. A squadron of armored vehicles from the British 6th Airborne Division is patrolling the streets of Haifa. The Jewish area of Mount Carmel in Haifa has been sealed off, and British soldiers on alert have been ordered to prepare for any eventuality. According to Jewish sources, another Jewish refugee ship, the "Victim," carrying 700 Jews, is sailing behind "Return Home" towards Palestine. Officials announced that the refugees on both ships will be sent to Cyprus. Officials are keeping the circumstances of the Navy's interception of the two ships a secret.</p>

<h3>Central Military Police Officials Come to Shanghai to Thoroughly Investigate Responsibility for the Golden Theater Bloodshed; Military, Police, and Military Police Organize Investigation Committee to Jointly Handle; Police Post Resumption Partially Restored in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Garrison Command is taking the military police conflict and bloodshed incident at the Golden Theater very seriously. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Commander Xuan, accompanied by Police Chief Yu Shuping, Deputy Chief Zhang Shi, Inspector General Zhang Da, and others, personally went to the New City Branch to persuade police officers not to take excessive actions and to resume their work. At the same time, in order to investigate the truth and prevent the situation from escalating, an investigation committee was organized by the Garrison Command, the Police Department, and the Military Police Regiment. The Garrison Command sent Chief of the Inspection Department Tao Yishan, the Police Department sent Deputy Chief Zhang Shi, and the Military Police Regiment sent Regiment Commander Wu Guangyun. The three held a preliminary consultation at Tao Yishan's residence at 12:30 PM, and decided that the principle was to not allow the incident to escalate, investigate the truth, and handle it impartially. The three parties also each sent two staff members to conduct further investigations to determine who was responsible. The military police platoon leader Li Yutai who caused the incident and other relevant military police have been detained by the 23rd Military Police Regiment, and the police officers who were injured or killed in the bloodshed will receive preferential compensation. Because Commander Xuan believed that the case was of great importance and he needed to be fair with his judgement, he has telegraphed the Ministry of National Defense to send high-ranking officials to Shanghai to preside over the resolution.</p>
<p>According to a statement issued by Commander Xuan: he has not yet relinquished his concurrent position as police chief, so even if he handles the matter impartially, it would inevitably be said that he is biased. Therefore, he has specifically requested the Ministry of National Defense and the Military Police Headquarters to quickly send senior officials to Shanghai to investigate and handle the matter. Yu Shuping has also telegraphed the National Police Agency to send personnel to Shanghai. It is now known that the Military Police Headquarters and the National Police Agency have already dispatched high-ranking officials, who left Beijing by car on the evening of the 28th and are expected to arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 29th. They will work with Shanghai to conduct an investigation and then study a handling method in order to achieve a satisfactory resolution.</p>
<p>The police were quite agitated yesterday morning, forming a situation of striking posts, and a small number gathered at the Golden Theater, destroying the interior equipment of the theater. After Commander Xuan gave a lecture at the New City Branch in the morning, Chief Yu Shuping also tried his best to persuade and stop them. At 2:00 PM, Mayor Wu, accompanied by Deputy Chief Zhang Shi, went to the New City Branch again to advise the police officers to focus on maintaining order. At the same time, after hearing about the incident, the Ministry of Interior in Nanjing urgently telegraphed the municipal government to quickly seek a resumption of work. After 3:00 PM, the road posts gradually resumed partially. In order to maintain public order and prevent criminals from taking advantage of the situation, the Garrison Command dispatched all nine inspection brigades and the first and second volunteer inspection brigades to patrol key areas. Traffic on all roads was maintained by police officers and volunteer police dispatched by the General Bureau.</p>
<p>Military Police Regiment Issues Statement on the Incident</p>
<p>The 23rd Military Police Regiment sent letters to various newspapers yesterday, publishing the following account of the bloodshed incident: "At around 10:00 PM the previous night, six military police officers from the 8th Company of the Military Police Corps on Kangding Road, on orders, went to the Golden Theater to inspect military discipline. Because a conflict arose between a customer buying a ticket and an employee of the Golden Theater, the military police team went forward to mediate and had a misunderstanding with police officer number 6588. Another military police team led by Platoon Leader Li Yutai also went to the Golden Theater to inspect, and Li and the police officer had a quarrel that escalated into a fight. Other military police officers then struck the police officer with their rifle butts. At this time, Chen Fan, an officer attached to the headquarters of the Military Police Corps, along with six soldiers, passed by the Golden Theater and went forward to mediate. Police officer 6588 claimed to have been seriously injured, but Officer Chen personally inspected him and did not see any serious injuries. At the time, Chen notified Zhuo Qingbao, the chief of the New City Branch, by telephone, and agreed to send police officer 6588 to the hospital for treatment, with the military police responsible for the medical expenses. Chief Zhuo of the branch expressed his agreement and guaranteed that the incident would not escalate. After ten minutes, Section Chief Gu of the branch came to the Golden Theater. After discussions between the two sides, the incident was resolved.</p>
<p>Unarmed Police Surrounded Regiment</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, when Platoon Leader Li Yutai left the Golden Theater, he was surrounded by more than 100 plainclothes police officers. Li and others retreated to the third floor of the Golden Theater and notified the company headquarters and the chief of the New City Branch by telephone. Before long, Company Commander Wang and Deputy Chief Xia of the New City Branch rushed to the Golden Theater, but were still unable to resolve the situation. At this time, Deputy Chief Xia and the military police were on the third floor of the Golden Theater, and unexpectedly a truck of military police officers from the Military Affairs Team of the Military Police Corps on Kaina Road, heading from east to west, was surrounded by hundreds of police officers due to a misunderstanding. The military police officers in the truck, seeing the situation and the fact that the hundreds of police officers were not in uniform, immediately jumped out of the truck and lay down on the ground. Company Commander Ren Yafu, who was on the truck, only understood the truth of the incident after questioning. At this time, it was already close to 11:00 PM, and coincidentally a truck full of watermelons was driving from west to east. The police officers stopped the truck from moving forward, and gunfire began at this time. The first bullet struck the white jeep of the US military police joint patrol team. The two American military police officers and our military police officer immediately jumped out and lay down. Gunfire gradually became denser."</p>
<p>The Mystery of the First Shot</p>
<p>Therefore, the Military Police Regiment believes that there should be a fair investigation into who fired the first shot, which caused the large-scale conflict. However, according to Zhang Shi, the deputy chief of the Police Department, the department has sent Lu Dagong, the chief of the security guard office, to investigate with the US-China military police team, but there was no such thing, and the shell casings found at the scene of the incident were all rifle bullets and Thomson submachine gun bullets. It is now up to the investigation team to rigorously investigate who should be held responsible.</p>
<p>Police Firearms are Registered</p>
<p>According to Zhuo Qingbao, the chief of the New City Police Branch, "If it is said that the police fired the first shot, it is not true, because the firearms and ammunition issued to the police on duty must be returned to the armory when they leave. Even if one bullet is fired, it must be reported truthfully. All firearms and ammunition in the bureau are registered in a register." He also said, "The dozens of shell casings recovered this time were all from Thomson submachine guns, rifles, and 'Type 38' rifles. All the ones owned by the police station are 'Type 38' pistols."</p>
<h3>Deputy Commander of Military Police States: Plainclothes Police Had Firearms</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Report] Liu Conglong, the deputy commander of the 23rd Military Police Regiment, made the following three points in response to the police department's claim that all plainclothes police officers were not carrying firearms: (1) The plainclothes police officers had no task to go to the Golden Theater, so there was no need to send more than 200 people. (2) The regiment recovered six Browning bullet casings, but the regiment did not have such firearms. (3) At dawn, it was discovered that all the plainclothes police officers were equipped with firearms. Also, at around 00:30, US Navy military police officer Parker was driving a jeep from the west when he was ordered to stop by plainclothes police. The US military police officer ignored the order, and two shots were fired from behind. One bullet hit the windshield of the jeep. After that, gunfire erupted everywhere. The US military police officer went to the Military Police Regiment on the 28th to talk and made a statement, proving that the bullets that hit the car were fired from a Browning pistol, and proving that they were fired by plainclothes police officers.</p>
<h3>City Council Sends Members to Investigate</h3>
<p>The City Council is extremely concerned about this incident. Yesterday afternoon, Speaker Pan entrusted councilors Hou Jiyuan, Fei Shusheng, Zhang Zhongyuan, Zhang Naizuo, and others to go to the Police Department and the 23rd Military Police Regiment to inquire about the incident, and hoped that the police would first resume their posts. Both sides emphasized the safety of citizens and social order, and jointly sought a fair resolution according to the law.</p>
<h3>Chief Prosecutor Huang States: No Comments</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Last night, reporters visited Huang Liang, the chief prosecutor of the local court in this city, to inquire about the attitude of the prosecutor's office towards the Golden Theater bloodshed. According to him, the prosecutor's office has not received any report on the case, and only knows a little about it from the newspapers. Military police officers are active-duty soldiers and are not under the jurisdiction of the court. Police officers are civil servants of the municipal government. If they have illegal or improper actions, or if victims come to file a lawsuit, the prosecutor's office will of course accept it and investigate it according to legal procedures. As for this case, I currently have no comments.</p>
<h3>Funeral Expenses for Six Deceased Police Officers Exceed 40 Million</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In addition to Guo Shimin, the street vendor who was killed by a stray bullet and whose body has been claimed by his family for coffin preparation, the bodies of six others, including police cadet Shi Wenbiao, were sent to the central funeral home on Ma Bai Road yesterday evening for encoffining. The ceremony was presided over by Chief Yu and was simple and solemn, with more than a thousand guests attending, demonstrating great honor. According to Director Sun Jialiang, the cost of the clothing, coffins, and other funeral arrangements for the six police officers totaled more than 40 million, which was allocated by the municipal government. A special condolence payment of 20 million per person was requested by the police department.</p>
<h3>Vengeance and Justice Society Issues Fourteen Demands</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The "7/27 Bereaved Comrades Seeking Justice and Vengeance Aftermath Handling Committee" of the Municipal Police Department yesterday issued fourteen demands for the authorities to accept. The original text is as follows: (1) Demand the execution of the violent and secretive bandit Li Yutai.

(10) Demand the punishment of those responsible for improper handling of the situation.

(12) Please have the military police pay attention to academic training and legal training, so that they have some "compassion". (13) Please do not be alarmed by these supportive classmates. We are all driven by sympathy and an ignited sense of righteousness. (14) Please have the Military Police Regiment guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future.</p>
<h3>Military Police Ordered to Partially Strike</h3>
<p>On the military police side, in order to avoid further unfortunate events after the conflict, the 23rd Military Police Regiment was ordered on the 28th to partially strike work, stay in the barracks, and await the resolution of the incident.</p>

<h3>Traffic Unmanned: Cars Becoming as Slow as Oxen</h3>
<p>Street Gossip</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The shops and residents along Fuxu Road and Tongfu Road suffered a great shock the night before, and the aftershocks are still present. Yesterday, whenever military police officers were seen passing by, they ran to avoid them. Nearby shops were closed all day, and residents used the case as a topic of conversation, discussing it a lot. In particular, watermelon vendors and soda vendors described their experiences and eyewitness accounts in vivid detail, attracting many passersby to stop and listen. Although military police officers in yellow uniforms appeared from time to time in the streets and at the Golden Theater, traffic at the crossroads was unmanned, and vehicles came and went, competing for the lead, creating a chaotic order. At the same time, traffic throughout the city was also chaotic due to the lack of police officers directing traffic, causing road congestion and cars to move as slowly as oxen, giving the feeling of "I can't go, brother."</p>
<h3>Eight Dead, Eight Injured: A List; Three Military Police Officers Also Injured</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] It has been learned that the deceased police cadet Shi Wenbiao, number 693, had a gunshot wound to his abdomen. Que Shaowu, number 6868, had a bullet to the head.

(4) Payment must be made to the designated bank.</p>
<h3>Jin Du Theater Destroyed for the Third Time, Engineer's Whereabouts Unknown, Cinema Association Issues Written Statement</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Regarding the destruction of the Jin Du Grand Theater yesterday, the Cinema Association issued a written statement, which reads: "According to the Jin Du Grand Theater's report, at about 9:30 PM on the 27th of this month, three audience members with two tickets attempted to enter the theater, but were politely refused by the ticket collector, leading to a dispute. A military police officer on duty at the scene mediated. Another police officer in the theater also came to mediate. It is unknown how a misunderstanding occurred, followed by a fight. The police officer then left angrily. The theater was fortunate that nothing happened. However, soon after, a large group of police officers came to the theater, with a threatening momentum. Because the theater was full, for the safety of over a thousand audience members, the iron gates were closed for isolation, which is the only method used by theaters to prevent incidents and protect the audience. At that time, the noise outside the theater was chaotic, and the crowd grew larger and larger. It was impossible to distinguish between soldiers, police, and civilians. The stalemate lasted until about 12:30 AM, when gunshots suddenly rang out, intermittently, until about 2:30 AM. Fortunately, responsible leaders arrived, and the situation calmed down. The truth and falsehood have been investigated by the responsible authorities and will soon be clarified. Unexpectedly, at about 11:00 AM, 1:00 PM, and 4:30 PM today (the 28th), the theater was destroyed by dozens of police officers in trucks. The employees in the theater were brutally beaten, and an engineer who came to inspect the air conditioning equipment was taken away and his whereabouts are still unknown. All the theater's assets were destroyed. The theater suffered an unexpected disaster due to a conflict involving military police, which is deeply regrettable. For the survival of the industry and the safety of the audience, the association will continue to demand the punishment of the perpetrators. Also, in the afternoon of the same day, dozens of police officers in trucks went to various theaters and ordered the removal of the original military police seats. Fortunately, the theaters handled it properly, and no incidents occurred. The association believes that the main cause of this unfortunate incident is the unclear division of responsibilities between the police and the military. This has been fully explained to Director Yu of the Police Bureau. We dare not judge who is right and who is wrong, but the destruction of Jin Du Theater three times today is truly chilling to the industry. Therefore, in addition to requesting the authorities to provide effective protection and compensation for all the damages suffered by Jin Du, we also demand the prompt punishment of the perpetrators and the adoption of effective measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again. Otherwise, the members of the association, for the safety of the audience and their own survival, will be forced to close down completely."</p>
<p>Equipment Completely Destroyed, Film Strips Fly Like Butterflies</p>
<p>According to news from the Cinema Business Association: According to reports received by the association, Jin Du was destroyed several times yesterday, with the last time ending at 4:30 PM. Afterwards, the Garrison Command sent a team to guard the theater, and peace was restored. However, at that time, all the equipment inside the theater had been completely destroyed. Even the large glass windows outside the theater, the neon lights, and the pair of large candles from the "Dragon and Phoenix Candles" advertisement were not spared. During the destruction, all the film strips of "Dragon and Phoenix Candles" were thrown out of the windows and into the street one after another. Passersby scrambled to pick them up and watch them, creating a very chaotic situation. Someone on the roof threw accumulated firewood from a high altitude, causing the neon lights to be "smashed to pieces."</p>
<p>Tea Boys Escape Over the Roof</p>
<p>At that time, three tea boys escaped by climbing over the roof, but employees Zeng Tingjie and petitioning police officer Yu Naimiao were reported missing. Also, Zhang Yonggen, the inspector who was in charge at the time of the dispute the previous night, has been summoned by the Police Headquarters for interrogation. Therefore, it is difficult for others to guess the truth of the matter at that time. Liu Heqing, the manager of the theater, went to the First Brigade of Inspectors to report the incident at about 10:00 AM this morning and was still waiting for interrogation in the team tonight.</p>
<p>The detailed situation of Jin Du's losses is difficult to calculate in practice because no one dared to enter for detailed investigation after the incident. However, according to people in the theater, if everything was destroyed, the amount of loss would be around 4 to 5 billion.</p>

<h3>If There is No Proper Solution, Closure Will Be Considered</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] According to Liang Qitian, Chairman of the Cinema Association, the only hope of the association in the future is to ensure the safety of merchants and civilians. If the authorities have no proper solution in the short term, the city's theaters will inevitably consider closing down. The association will visit the Mayor today to express their concerns.</p>
<h3>High Court Asks the Ministry of Justice to Explain Ambiguities in Martial Law</h3>

<h3>Thinking Irrationally in Confinement, Traitors Hope for Cold Drinks to Relieve the Heat, Sternly Rejected and Dejected</h3>
<p>For several days, the weather in the city has been scorching hot. The 452 traitors, both convicted and awaiting trial, detained in the Tilanqiao High Court Detention Center, cannot bear the suffering of being imprisoned in the hot summer. A few days ago, they jointly petitioned Warden Shan, requesting permission to go out of prison every night to cool off and to allow family members to send in watermelons, ice blocks, soda, Coca-Cola, and other seasonal thirst-quenching items to relieve the summer heat. Warden Shan stated that according to prison regulations, prisoners are not allowed to enjoy luxury goods that are not necessities of life. Except for bananas and apples, which are helpful for health and disease resistance, and are allowed to be sent in by family members as before, all other unreasonable demands of the prisoners are sternly rejected. The prisoners were greatly disappointed upon hearing the news and were dejected for a long time.

Du Yuesheng then rose to report on the fundraising plan, which included issuing lottery tickets and raising funds, hoping that the attendees would express their opinions. Pan Gongzhan explained that disaster relief is like fighting a fire, and there is no time to delay. Funds should be raised immediately to provide emergency relief. Xu Jiyun's opinion was that overall planning is necessary before distributing the funds, and that emergency needs should be met by advance payments from all parties, while slower aspects should be addressed by selling lottery tickets. Qian Xinzi stated that the disaster in Guangdong and Guangxi was severe and that people should sympathize.

Yang Dezhao, Secretary General of the Committee, Dong Hefu, a representative of the paper merchants, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Commercial and Vocational Association, and Luo Qinghua and Xi Yushu also expressed their opinions.</p>

Finally, Song Ziwen stood up again to conclude, stating that the fundraising principles of the committee are: (1) Raising funds, (2) Lottery tickets. Regarding the first item, raising funds takes time, but disaster relief cannot be delayed. It is planned to borrow 10 billion yuan from the national banks, bureaus, and treasury for advance payment, guaranteed by himself and the five deputy chairmen. Regarding the second item, it must first be submitted to the government for approval before a decision can be made. Song then announced that a meeting would be held this morning at the Bank of China Building to discuss the appointment of standing committee members in order to promote fundraising efforts.</p>
<h3>Mayser Suffers Illness in Prison, High Court Rules for Release on Bail, Left Detention Center Yesterday for Treatment at Hong En Hospital</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Mayser, the "Foreign Tiger" in the financial disruption case, was sentenced to one year of imprisonment by both the District Court and the High Court. The case is currently in the third instance at the Supreme Court. Mayser is detained in the District Court Detention Center on Sinan Road. The defense lawyer has applied to the High Court and the Supreme Court to stop the detention, but both were rejected. However, the Supreme Court's ruling stated that "Regarding the claim that he is currently suffering from illness, since it was not mentioned to the original court, suddenly making an empty claim to this court is clearly improper." Based on this point, the defense lawyer argued that Mayser suffers from severe neurological illness, nasal ulcers, lymphatic gland inflammation, and insomnia, and applied for cessation of detention based on Article 114, Paragraph 1, Item 3 of the Criminal Procedure Law, which states "if the detainee is currently suffering from an illness that may not be treated due to detention." The High Court sent personnel to investigate and confirmed that Mayser was indeed suffering greatly from illness in the detention center, and therefore ruled in favor of the application. He was ordered to pay a cash bail of 100 million legal currency and provide a guarantee from a reputable shop, readily available for call. After the defense lawyer completed the procedures, Mayser was released from the District Court Detention Center and taken to Hong En Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Fish Vendor Prosecuted for Fraud</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Fish Vendor Mao Jiasheng was prosecuted for fraud yesterday by the District Prosecutor's Office. According to the indictment: Mao, who is a fish vendor, issued two bad checks totaling 13 million legal currency on May 14th and 15th of this year, and defrauded the Jicheng Fish Shop of 197 loads of salted yellow croaker, valued at 26,486,650 yuan. After Zheng Baokang of the shop discovered this, he reported it to the Wusong Police Station, who sent Mao Jiasheng to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Mao argued: "Because I lost money selling fish, I did not pay the money." It was found that the money of the defendant in the Hongkou branch of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank was less than 13 million yuan, but he privately issued a check of 13 million yuan. He has admitted that he bought the fish, and then sold it again and did not pay. Even if his losses are true, he should have explained it to the plaintiff, but he secretly hid it elsewhere. His suspicion of using bad checks to defraud the plaintiff of yellow croaker cannot be said to be small. His actions constitute the crimes of Article 339, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law and Article 136, paragraph 2 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, and a public prosecution is filed in accordance with the law.</p>

<h3>Gold Rush Case: Two Defendants, Zhan Sheng Applies for Retrial</h3>

<h3>Hang Jiaoci Hosted Local Reporters Yesterday, Elucidating the Significance of Reorganizing Jiaotong University</h3>
<p>The Jiaotong University Reorganization Committee Resolved Yesterday: Based on the Three Principles of "Fairness," "Generosity," and "Speed," Reorganization will be Completed Within One Month, and a New President Will Be Appointed.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After Jiaotong University President Wu Baofeng's resignation was approved, the Ministry of Education organized a Reorganization Committee composed of nine members, including three Ministry of Education officials: Hang Liwu, Vice Minister of Education, Counselor Xiang Jutan, and Dan Yin Xun; five from the Alumni Association: Mao Yisheng, President of Beiyang Institute of Technology (also Secretary of the Committee), Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau, Zhao Zukang, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Works Bureau, Zhou Ren, Director of the Engineering Research Institute of the Academia Sinica, and Zhou Junshi, President of the National Wusong Merchant Marine Academy; and Gu Yiyu, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau. Vice Minister Hang served as the Chairman of the Committee. Yesterday morning at 9:00 am, the Reorganization Committee held its first meeting at the Academia Sinica, resolving to complete the reorganization within one month based on the three principles of "fairness," "generosity," and "speed," and to appoint a new president. It also hired nine faculty and staff members from the university to form a University Affairs Committee, responsible for the daily affairs of the university and implementing the resolutions of the Reorganization Committee. The selection of the nine members of the University Affairs Committee is still under negotiation and will be decided soon. It was also decided that the Reorganization Committee would be dissolved after the new president is announced. Vice Minister Hang was unable to stay in Shanghai for a long time due to his ministerial duties. During his absence from Shanghai, Secretary Mao Yisheng will act as Chairman.</p>
<p>Reorganization Work: Emphasis on Positivity Over Negativity</p>
<p>Yesterday at 5:00 pm, Vice Minister Hang Liwu, along with Mao Yisheng and Zhao Zengjue, hosted reporters from various newspapers at the Academia Sinica. During the event, Vice Minister Hang stated that after 1840, our country felt the need to rely on new education to invigorate and strengthen itself due to the oppression of foreign powers. However, at that time, emphasis was placed on dialect education and military preparation. It was not until the Sino-Japanese War in 1895 that we felt that if we wanted to become strong, we could not only rely on dialect and military preparation education. So, we established practical science education and founded Beiyang University and Nanyang University. Later, Nanyang University evolved into Jiaotong University. Therefore, Jiaotong University is actually the beginning of practical science education in modern Chinese educational history. It has a history of more than 50 years and has been managed by many people. The academic atmosphere has always been very pure, and the academic standards are also high. Graduates have made great contributions to the country's transportation construction. However, since the restoration, the school's discipline has become increasingly lax due to the instigation of a small number of students.</p>
<p>The last semester was particularly bad. Classes were only held for six weeks, and the semester's coursework could not be completed. Recently, during the holidays, hundreds of students from outside the school mixed into the campus to live, organize groups, and publish publications, going beyond normal practices. Parents of students and people from all walks of life complained, and even teachers, staff, and outstanding students within the school felt the need for improvement. President Wu Baofeng resigned four times, and the Ministry of Education had no choice but to approve his resignation. Before the new president is announced, a Reorganization Committee has been specially organized to be responsible for rectification. Based on the three principles of "fairness," "generosity," and "speed," we seek active improvement and take effective measures to restore normalcy as soon as possible and maintain past reputation. The reorganization work emphasizes positivity over negativity. Its purpose is to cherish the past history of Jiaotong University and enable it to develop further in the future. I believe that the current faculty and staff, in order to protect the school, will be able to cooperate and overcome difficulties together. And most students, especially those who are usually excellent, do not need to be suspicious or fearful. This reorganization work will not shake the foundation of Jiaotong University itself, but anything that hinders the future development of the school will be removed. The current Reorganization Committee is clearing a path so that the new president can develop the school and make Jiaotong University the highest institution of transportation engineering in the country.</p>
<p>Members of the Reorganization Committee Will Not Serve as President in the Future</p>
<p>Mao Yisheng continued: The Reorganization Committee is a transitional organization after President Wu's resignation and before the new president is announced. Its task is to maintain and improve. Alumni participating in the Reorganization Committee have an unshirkable duty to protect the school. Minister Zhu once stated that the Reorganization Committee can participate in the selection of the new president, so it is also the new president's trial selection committee. However, members participating in the Reorganization Committee only contribute opinions and do not serve as president.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Vice Minister Hang came to Shanghai to handle the work of Jiaotong University, and it has come to an end. He took the train back to Beijing last night.</p>
<p>Reorganization Time: Estimated to be at Least One Month</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to a member of the Jiaotong University School Affairs Reorganization Committee yesterday, the committee will conduct necessary and reasonable reorganization of the school based on the principle of fairness and generosity. This reorganization includes many aspects, roughly including: (1) Conducting a general registration of students and submitting the registers to the Ministry; (2) Taking action against students with poor academic performance; (3) Requiring all non-Jiaotong University students to move out of the school; (4) Adjusting school personnel as appropriate; (5) Internal reorganization of the school, which is particularly important. The person in charge also stated that the reorganization time is expected to be at least one month. During the reorganization period, general school affairs will proceed as usual. Also: Jiaotong University Dean of the College of Engineering Qiu Weiyu, Professor Zhou Ming, and Director of General Affairs Ji Wenmei visited Hang at the Academia Sinica at 10:00 am yesterday during the first meeting of the Jiaotong University School Affairs Reorganization Committee chaired by Vice Minister Hang, and had friendly discussions on the reorganization opinions of the school.</p>

<h3>First Self-Funded Students, Alumni Association Moves from the US to Shanghai, Second Self-Funded Students to Dine Together Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Ministry of Education's first self-funded student examination was held in Chongqing in 1932, and more than 30 groups of students were admitted in liberal arts, science, law, business, agriculture, engineering, and medicine, totaling more than 327 students, who were quite selected at the time. At that time, the war situation was critical, the rear was tight, and the allied countries had quite a bit of criticism of our government. All the students were ordered by the government to postpone their departure, but most of them were civil servants and teachers, and they had resigned from their original positions to go to Chongqing to apply for departure procedures. Among them, many sold their clothes or borrowed from relatives and friends to plan for the departure expenses, which at that time only required 100,000 legal tender. After this obstacle, they were trapped in the capital, facing a dilemma. Before long, the international situation improved, the ban on students going abroad was lifted, and they hurriedly handled the departure procedures, flew to India, transferred to the United Kingdom and the United States, and entered various famous university graduate schools for research. After two and a half years, our country won the victory and recovered its territory, and these students also completed their studies one after another. The person in charge of the first self-funded student alumni association stated that the students in that session were statistically admitted to 33 universities in the United States, with the University of Michigan being the most, followed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard, Columbia, and New York Universities. The actual number of people who went abroad was more than 290, and more than 210 had obtained master's degrees, and two had even obtained doctorates in engineering. Because the country needs talents to build the country, most of the students have returned home after finishing their studies. At present, in addition to more than 30 people who are in factories and large companies in the United States for internships, more than 50 people who are continuing to study for doctorates in the United States, and more than 10 people who are working in various units of the United Nations government, the remaining approximately 200 students have returned to China and are serving in various agencies, factories, and universities in their own country, occupying important positions and achieving remarkable results. The alumni association of the self-funded students of that session has now moved from the United States to Shanghai, and has set up a temporary office at Room 410, York Building, 29 Tianzhutang Street, this city, to handle the registration and liaison affairs of the students. I hope that the students who have returned to China will contact Li Xiang at the association as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The second alumni association of self-funded students will hold a social gathering at the Shanghai Youth Hall, 454 Huashan Road, this city, at 6:00 pm tomorrow (the 30th).

<h3>Reform Can Be Implemented When the Time is Right, Currency System Reform Is Not Difficult, Ample Preparation Should Be Made Now, Funding is Easily Solved</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Since Special Envoy Wedemeyer came to China, discussions about currency system reform have resurfaced. Fan Heyan, Deputy Director of the Secretariat of the Central Bank, expressed his views on this issue from his personal standpoint. He stated that China's currency system reform is currently fully prepared, waiting for the right time to be implemented. Because after eight years of the War of Resistance and then facing the Communist rebellion, the issuance of currency has reduced the people's belief in legal tender. If reform is implemented, the value of the currency can be determined, prices will stabilize accordingly, and the balance of financial revenue and expenditure can gradually be achieved. Furthermore, the number of Chinese banknotes issued is not excessive, only equivalent to 3-4 billion US dollars, and the funding for currency system reform is easily solved. After the currency system reform, the true situation will be made public at any time, which can reduce the people's unnecessary doubts. China is an agricultural country, and its people are hardworking and simple in their needs. Various materials are not as scarce as generally rumored, so China's economic situation today is not very serious. Recently, the military situation has improved, and the situation is very stable. Currency system reform does not seem to need to wait until the end of the suppression of the Communists.</p>
<h3>More Buying than Selling of Chinese Stocks, Unstable Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Among Chinese stocks yesterday, only Yongsha was relatively stable amidst the volatility. Xinyi and Meiya became even more sluggish, difficult to recover, and the process was very bleak. The payment of capital made people feel that the availability of funds would be tight, and the trend was not optimistic. Furthermore, spot Yongsha began to loosen, and ordinary stockholders took advantage of the high prices to sell their shares. Guangkan helped both inside and outside the field also sell, so the overall situation was not as tight as in the previous days. Active participants in the industry dumped empty shares, and the banking gang went in and out initially, but the recent close was relatively peaceful.</p>
<p>The morning opening was relatively stable. After the opening of the Yongsha, it advanced from 112, No. 94 to 240 yuan. Numbers 104, 173, 231, and 219 were sold off, retreating to 231 yuan.

Guangkan helped close positions outside the field. People's sentiment was slightly fatigued due to financial concerns. Numbers 171, 45, 160, 152, and 183 even supplied spot Yongsha. Close to noon, the Yongsha was forced down to 228 yuan. After 12:00 PM, short positions were covered. Numbers 235 and 61 bought in, and numbers 56 and 190 also bought spot Yongsha. Number 218 still supplied for sale. Number 171 and 106 still sold spot Yongsha. The market price saw a major tug-of-war around 230 yuan.</p>
<p>At the close, Number 8 entered with Yongsha. Numbers 190 and 156 entered with spot Yongsha. The closing price was very stable. Among other familiar stocks, only Xinguang and Jingfu were able to pull up after falling. The chronic illnesses of Xinyi and Meiya were difficult to cure. As a result, compared to the previous close, the spot Yongsha rose slightly, Xinguang and Jingfu declined slightly, Meiya and Xinyi fell by half a percent, Zhongfa, Yonggong, and Dongxing each fell by about one percent, Xinhua fell by half a percent, and Jinglun also fell.

As a result, compared to the previous close, Jia and Yi fell by 500 yuan, Unified C fell by 400 yuan, Unified D fell by 300 yuan, and Unified E fell slightly by 100 yuan. The trading volume was around 2 million.</p>
<p>Among foreign stocks yesterday, only the paper industry caused a lot of profit-taking news due to the shareholders' meeting. There was news of exchanging China Paper Edition Company stock, starting from 24,000 yuan. Foreign merchants pushed the buying price up to 27,500 yuan to close. Because the stimulating performance of the remaining stocks was reduced, they were all tired. Yisha opened in the morning at 85,000 yuan, retreated from 87,000 yuan to 79,000 yuan, and then hovered outside 80,000 yuan. The securities gang and Jinhao industry sold, and the Guangkan and foreign companies bought. As a result, compared to the previous close, only the paper industry rose by slightly more than half, Jardine Matheson was the only one that remained flat, telephone fell by one percent, Yisha and Xiangtai fell by half a percent, and the remaining stocks fell slightly.</p>
<h3>Over a Hundred Organizations Promoting the Subscription of Treasury Bonds</h3>
<p>Minimum Subscription of 10 US Dollars</p>
<p>The patriotic campaign to solicit a million citizens to subscribe to treasury bonds, the US Dollar Bond Fundraising Committee, has been prepared and approved by President Zhang of the National Bank. It is officially scheduled to begin on August 1st, jointly promoted by over one hundred organizations in the city. Starting today, the committee will send the subscription forms to various organizations, asking them to distribute them to their members. This campaign stipulates a minimum subscription of 10 US dollars, with no maximum limit. The subscription procedures have been simplified as much as possible. Those who want to subscribe only need to notify the committee, and a representative will be sent to collect the money and deliver the bonds.</p>
<h3>Four Banks Savings Association Prepares to Repay Pre-War Deposits</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of repaying pre-war deposits, there has been no appropriate solution to date. Previous court rulings to repay at a rate of 1,000 to 2,000 times have been strongly opposed by the banking industry. The Legislative Yuan is now planning to repay at two rates of more than 900 times and more than 300 times, and stipulates that national banks and civil affairs are not included in this example. This point has also aroused opposition from all walks of life. It is generally believed that if pre-war deposits of national banks are still repaid on a 1:1 basis, it would be tantamount to losing the public's trust in national banking institutions. How can savings deposits be absorbed through normal means in the future? Therefore, it is hoped that the Legislative Yuan will seriously consider this issue when completing the legislative procedures.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Four Banks Savings Association has the largest number of pre-war deposits among the commercial banks. It is said that after the number of times to be repaid is determined, the Association will sell real estate to repay the number of times it should repay.</p>
<h3>Various Difficulties Awaiting Overcoming, Shanghai's Coal Supply Still Falls Short, Resignation of Chairman of Fuel Management Committee, Xu Letian, Approved</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to a person in charge of the Fuel Management Committee, the current issues of increasing coal production involve security, transportation, and food, and these difficulties need to be overcome separately. Regarding the supply and demand of coal in Shanghai, the monthly demand is 270,000 tons. However, the actual amount of coal arriving is only 160,000 to 170,000 tons, so there is still a shortage. Recently, the situation of coal arriving from various places has improved, which is largely due to the assistance of President Zhang of the Central Bank.</p>
<p>[Also Reported] Xu Letian, Chairman of the Fuel Management Committee, and Zhang Xiwei, Deputy Chairman, are scheduled to go to Beijing together on the 30th to participate in the National Coal Production Increase Conference convened by the Ministry of Economic Affairs on August 1st. The Fuel Management Committee has prepared a written report on the current coal production situation in various places, with attached suggestions for improvement, to be submitted to the conference for discussion.</p>
<p>Chairman Xu of the Committee repeatedly requested to resign due to gastric ulcer, and has recently received approval from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The directive stated that the member has been in charge of the Committee's affairs for many years and is deeply trusted. After repeatedly expressing his illness and firmly requesting his resignation, and recommending Deputy Director Zhang Xiwei to take over the position, the request was approved. However, he should hand over the duties of the Director of the Committee at the end of this month and has been hired by the Ministry as a consultant. After handing over the Committee's affairs, it is still hoped that he will overcome difficulties together and continue to guide the Committee's affairs. In addition to issuing separate appointment and dismissal orders, a letter of appointment and dismissal has been issued, which should be received and forwarded. After receiving the order, Chairman Xu immediately thanked Minister Liang and ordered his subordinates to expedite the transfer.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cloth Stable</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn fluctuated little yesterday. The initial opening was stable due to the participation of customer organizations, but then there were many sales due to tight funds, so the prices varied. 42s remained stable and unchanged. 20s Light Weight Double Horse was 10.9 million yuan, rising to 11.1 million yuan at the close, a rise of 200,000 yuan. The rest rose or fell by 100,000 to 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The opening price of Longtou fine cloth yesterday was low, but the market rebounded once after some scattered purchases. The closing price at noon was similar. Due to the end of the month, funds were tight, and there were many sales, so various goods were slightly sold off. Longtou fine cloth was stable at 434,000 yuan. The rest of the white blanks were also mostly small. Shilin cloth showed no change.</p>
<p>Textile Building Allotted Yarn</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] China Textile Building Company, as usual, jointly allotted yarn on behalf of the Textile Adjustment Association yesterday, allotting a total of 1,223 pieces, all of which were allotted to manufacturers. A total of 450 purchase applications were received.</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Trading Inactive</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market was stable, and prices were neither rising nor falling. Cotton yarn prices were slightly better, and people's sentiment was stable. However, yarn factories had absorbed a lot in the middle and upper parts of the past, so their intention to enter was slightly relaxed, so the transaction volume was not high. The price of each grade for delivery to the factory was 1.73 million for Huoji, 1.8 million for Nantai, and the price for delivery to the warehouse was 2.2 million for Lingbao, 1.68 million for Huoji, and 325,000 for Zihua.</p>
<h3>Please Postpone the Opening of Trade with Japan</h3>
<p>The Proposal of the China National Products Manufacturers Association</p>
<p>The China National Products Manufacturers Association held a meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday at the Jingu Hotel, attended by Wang Xiaolai, Gu Kemin, Ge Futian, Cao Zhigong, Tao Leqin, etc. Regarding the issue of opening trade with Japan, it was decided to telegraph the central government to postpone the opening of trade with Japan.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Trading Not Dull, Domestic Sales Show Frequent Bright Spots</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign tea market, only Wuchang Tea Company continued to inquire about low-grade Chen Qimen tea, while other exporters were mostly congested in their stomachs. It is estimated that the reason is that they are all busy replicating the 900 tons of Zhenmei green tea that French merchant Yongxing Foreign Company recently negotiated with Morocco in Africa, so as to actively deliver the goods and load them quickly, so the market is not lively. However, those who hold the goods hold a steady mentality, so the situation is still stable. As for the various domestic varieties, at this time of intense heat and sweating like rain, the de-icing by the street and customer organizations continued to increase day by day, so the transaction was still like a fish in water, and the prices showed frequent bright spots.</p>
<h3>60,000 Boxes of Tea Under Mortgage; Farmers Bank Processing Collateral</h3>
<p>Last year's aged tea, the Central Trust Bureau has already closed applications on the 25th of this month. The Farmers Bank of China is processing the collateral of mortgaged tea boxes that have not been redeemed by the due date, in accordance with regulations.</p>
<p>It is reported that as of the 28th, the Farmers Bank still holds mortgaged tea boxes: (1) Ping tea, 13,500 boxes, outstanding loan of 9 billion; (2) Qihong tea, 15,200 boxes, outstanding loan of 4.2 billion; (3) Tunlv tea, 2,100 boxes, outstanding loan of 450 million. In addition, there are also 300 boxes of Wenhong tea, with an outstanding loan of 250 million, and 500 boxes of Yulv tea, with an outstanding loan of 80 million. In total, there are 61,600 boxes, with an outstanding loan of 13.9 billion. Eight percent of these loans are not yet due, while the rest are overdue. The Farmers Bank is individually processing the collateral and still handing it over to the Central Trust Bureau for purchase.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Sericulture and Silk Production and Marketing Guidance Committee, in order to actively promote the export of raw silk, has been preparing to establish a Design Committee. After more than a month of preparation, various organizational charters, work plans, etc., have been drafted. It is learned that the Committee is scheduled to be formally established today at 4:00 PM and will hold its first meeting at the Central Bank at the same time. Committee Chairman Liu Gongyun, Standing Committee members Ge Jingzhong, Mark, and Tan Xihong will all be present.</p>
<h3>Food Rice Digestion Active; Market Price Continues to Rise Firmly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the total arrival of rice grains in the North and South markets was more than 3,300 dan (石). Digestion in the South market was still active, with Japonica and Indica rice prices rising by more than 10,000 yuan. The North market was lackluster in demand, with Japonica glutinous rice and high-grade materials slightly rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Medium and lower grades remained stable, and white rice was comparable.</p>
<p>Flour is about to be transshipped by Shenfang, market sentiment is firming, and prices continued to rise by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Wheat bran remained stable. Bean cake factories were quite firm in their holdings, and prices rose again by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Yingkou cake increased sharply by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. Soybean oil factories were absorbing supplies, and oil dealers, due to the high price of bean cake, were also actively procuring soybeans. Consequently, this street also followed suit in purchasing, and both new and old soybeans soared by more than 10,000 yuan. Broad beans were comparable, red beans remained unchanged for the time being, corn was stable, and red sorghum, being scarce, remained strong, rising by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Raw peanuts purchased from Southeast Asia suddenly became active, rising sharply by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Sesame remained firm, field peas were stable, and broad beans were in a state of decline. Wheat, due to the rise in flour prices, rose accordingly, rebounding by 10,000 yuan. However, the price of wheat offered by factories yesterday was a uniform standard price of 145,000 yuan, with adjustments for mud, ash, and moisture content as usual. Oil market showed slight discrepancies, soybean oil remained flat, clear oil declined by 10,000 yuan, rapeseed oil also decreased by more than 10,000 yuan, sesame oil rose by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, basket peanut oil was comparable, and Jiton (吉桶) peanut oil fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Rice from Rangoon Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Xuan ship, which transported a large quantity of rice from Rangoon to Shanghai, arrived at the port the day before yesterday (Sunday) evening and berthed at buoys number six and seven. It carried 122,678 bags of rice, totaling 8,919 tons, all purchased by the Central Trust Bureau. In addition, the foreign manager of Jardine Matheson and Co.'s, the "Qiao Qian Tuo Man Si" ship, arrived in Shanghai last Saturday, carrying 300 tons of foreign paper, 600 tons of pulp, and more than 1,000 large Kimura (木村) logs from Vancouver.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Continues Distribution as Usual; Rising Sugar Market Dampened</h3>
<p>The sugar market, which was affected by loose credit and rising prices of a hundred commodities over the weekend, saw a resurgence of rising tides. The current spot price for both single and double grades (medium and white refined sugar) had to be increased by more than 20,000 yuan. Although it was Sunday the day before yesterday, the market was still active and trading volume nearly doubled. The market opened higher yesterday morning, but then it was heard that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation had temporarily combined the second phase of distribution due to insufficient shipments. Now that it has resumed its original state, it will continue to distribute every week from this phase onwards. As a result, bulls rushed to sell, and the market situation turned from a peak to a downward trend, but it was still more than 10,000 yuan higher than last week.</p>
<h3>High Raw Material Costs Increase; Match Production Declines</h3>
<p>The match industry in this city is the center of the national match industry. The output of all match factories is sold to the provinces of Central China, accounting for about three-fifths, while the rest is sold to various places in North China. This city and the surrounding suburbs account for only a small part. During the months of April, May, and June of this year, all match factories once increased production and shipped their products to various parts of the country.</p>
<p>Now, people in the industry say: Since July, the production volume of each factory has begun to decline. The biggest reason is the reduction in sales in other ports. Provinces and regions affected by the war, such as the Northeast, cannot be directly transported to, and even other places, due to the decline of industry and commerce, the purchasing power of the people is becoming weaker. Especially since the increase in sea and land freight rates has increased the cost of sales to other ports, further increasing the burden on users in other ports. In this economic situation, the reduction in sales is inevitable.</p>
<p>As for the manufacturing of finished products, raw materials are increasingly scarce, resulting in high prices. Moreover, the cost is even more difficult to estimate, as workers' wages must be calculated based on the cost of living index. If the price of finished products follows the proportion of raw materials and labor and rises, the maintenance of sales will be even more worrying. Therefore, most match factories, even if they have sufficient raw materials, would rather store them and reduce production appropriately in order to suffer less losses and expect an improvement in the market.</p>
<h3>Yizhong Cigarettes Turn from Weak to Rise; Soap and Matches Flourish</h3>
<p>The trend of cigarettes, soap, and matches shows both firm and weak trends. At the opening yesterday, each grade was still considered stable, but later, due to weakening customer demand, the market gradually rose.</p>
<p>Cigarettes: Yizhong goods have been distributing goods continuously for several days, with supply exceeding demand, and customers are waiting and watching, with consecutive days of declines. Finally, the decline was too volatile, and the market rebounded and improved yesterday. However, Chinese-made cigarettes mostly fell from high to flat, with very few firm rises.</p>
<p>Matches were seemingly loose but actually tight. Both "Beautiful" and "Phoenix" brands saw price increases, while only "Golden Tripod" saw a slight decline, and the remaining goods remained stable. Soap was firm and thriving, full of vitality. "Gu Ben" rose by 8,000 yuan, "Arrow Knife" rose by 9,000 yuan, and the rest uniformly rose.</p>
<h3>China Silk Corporation Specifies Methods for Cocoon Reeling Above Quota</h3>
<p>The main points of the China Silk Corporation's method for sericulture farmers cocoon replacements over the quota are as follows: (1) Silk reeling manufacturers who did not receive loans for spring cocoons this period, and who have no other dry cocoons for reeling. (2) Association member manufacturers. (3) Manufacturers that started operations in 1946, having 40 or more silk reeling machines. Manufacturers that did not start operations in 1946, having 60 or more. Winter reeling machines are calculated at 10 machines per 10 threads. (4) The total amount of excess cocoons is limited to 5,000 dan of dry cocoons. (5) The number of cocoons allocated is 7 catties (市斤) of cocoons per day for each multi-thread silk reeling machine. For each sitting reeling machine, 4 to 5 catties of cocoons are allocated per day. The reeling period is until October 31st. (6) The guarantees of each manufacturer are based on equivalent acceptance bills as the first guarantee, and factory equipment as the second guarantee, with certification from the Third District Association. (7) For the allocation of cocoons for silk reeling, the amount of cocoons for reeling for 15 days will be issued first. Afterwards, cocoons will be allocated in batches every 10 days based on the amount of silk reeled. (8) Reeling discounts and replacement fees: The reeling discount for replaced cocoons will be based on the standard of the trial reeling. At the end of the replacement reeling, the manufacturer will settle the actual amount of silk handed over and must not be short. If there is a shortage of less than 2 dan, it will be compensated at the price of Shanghai D-grade raw silk. The replacement reeling fee for each dan of raw silk, in addition to offsetting dry and wet waste, will be handled according to the replacement reeling fee standard set by the Sericulture and Silk Guidance Committee.</p>
<h3>Sharp Decline in Penghu Fish Production</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Penghu, 28th] According to statistics, the fishing catch in Penghu County in June was 64,413 kilograms, worth NT$1,858,030, a sharp decline in production compared to before. The Penghu Islands are scattered in the southern part of the Taiwan Strait, with a coastline extending more than 160 kilometers. They are also located at the intersection of warm and cold currents, resulting in an extremely abundant aquatic life. The main fish products are mackerel, tuna, shark, cuttlefish, seaweed, laver, etc. In the past, the annual output would be as high as 4 million kilograms, exported to Japan and Taiwan. Currently, most fishing boats have been destroyed, and they can only rely on building stone formations on the coast to catch fish, called "stone weirs." There are more than 300 stone weirs in the county. Due to the primitive fishing methods, production has been sharply reduced. People engaged in fishing account for 70% of the Penghu population. To develop Penghu, it is urgent to revitalize the fishing industry.</p>
<h3>Difficult Agreement on Chemical and Dye Industries; Disputes over Quota Allocation of Raw Materials; Representatives of the Review Committee to Visit Director Shen to Discuss</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Quota Allocation Department of the Import Management Committee had already allocated quotas for industrial raw materials to importers based on last year's import performance. Later, due to the limited supply of industrial raw materials and the increasing difference between official and black market exchange rates, the Industrial Association consulted with the Allocation Department to make preliminary allocations among various industrial associations, and then contacted importers to seek direct allocation of national foreign exchange to the manufacturing industry in a way that would be truly beneficial. Later, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association jointly organized an Allocation Review Committee to collect reports from various industrial and commercial trade associations to handle negotiations. Raw materials such as tanning extracts, oils and fats, black iron sheets, iron, steel wire, angle iron, and pipes were negotiated and allocated by the relevant associations, such as the Soap Industry Association, the Cosmetics Industry Association, the Ironware Engineering Association, the Ironware Industry Association, the Hardware Business Association, the Electrical Equipment Industry Association, the Canned Food Industry Association, the Tin Printing and Can Manufacturing Industry Association, the Thermos Bottle Industry Association, and the Hardware Parts Business Association, and submitted to the Allocation Department. Other raw materials are also being handled in succession.</p>
<p>According to sources from the Review Committee: The most difficult and time-consuming to reach an agreement on are dyes and chemical raw materials. For both, several meetings have been convened with various industrial and commercial associations, with each meeting attended by more than 20 units. The various industrial associations, as early as in accordance with the notification of the Industrial Association, hoped to respect the agreement and were able to cooperate sincerely. The manufacturers members of the industrial associations were also able to listen to the instructions of their associations and wait quietly for allocation. However, the Chemical Raw Materials Business Association and the Pigment Business Association have consistently failed to reach an agreement.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon was the dye allocation meeting, with 24 industries in the industrial associations gathered at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, while the pigment industry was absent again, resulting in the failure of the agreement between industry and commerce. On the part of the Allocation Department, the pressure was very urgent and it indicated that it was impatient and was about to open up. The person in charge of the Review Committee expressed great anxiety. At the meeting yesterday, many people advocated that if the agreement is not reached and the allocation is unfair, the government should be requested to directly handle the import of raw materials, and then the Central Trust Bureau should sell them in batches to practical users through bidding.</p>
<p>According to sources from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: Yesterday, two officials from the Allocation Department attended the meeting and expressed regret at the slow progress of the Review Committee's negotiations. They also said that 70% of the first quarter's quota has been signed out. However, it is said that when the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association initially organized the Review Committee to handle negotiations, it was entrusted directly by Shen Zoting, the director of the Allocation Department, and was reported on file. Now that the Review Committee is in the process of negotiating, but the Allocation Department has already opened up 70%, this makes those who are loyal to the effort feel left out. Whether in the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial Association, or the various industrial trade associations, it is difficult to explain to their members.</p>
<p>The Review Committee has already designated representatives to visit Director Shen this morning to discuss solutions. One part of the opinion is to request the Allocation Department to stipulate the ratio between industry and commerce in a decisive manner, while another part of the opinion is to advocate a strong appeal to the National Economic Commission to correct the current trade policy.</p>
<h3>Market Opened with a Dismal Drop Yesterday; Rayon Listless and Unable to Rise; Factory Dealings Scarce; Silk Prices Soft</h3>
<p>Rayon was soft due to the pending distribution, therefore the market opened with a dismal drop yesterday. No. 120 Dongyang Yuguang opened at 24.7 million yuan for loose goods, and hovered between 24.4 million and 24.6 million yuan until noon. The smallest price in the afternoon was 24.2 million yuan, and the final closing price was 24.4 million yuan. The final selling price of Gaoshan Yuguang was 24.2 million yuan, a decrease of 2 million yuan compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>Factory dealings were very scarce, and the market was sluggish. BC grade asking prices were around 30 million yuan, but there were some transactions, priced at 28 million and 28.5 million yuan, but the payment was due in one week. In the afternoon, 15 dan of E-grade were traded, with a price fluctuation of 10,000 yuan. 10 dan were sold for 28.5 million yuan, and 5 dan were sold for 28.4 million yuan. Half of the payment was made in cash, and half was in promissory notes due in seven days. Asking prices for Qianjing zero dan were 17.5 million yuan, while the price of lower grade rayon was between 16.5 million and 17 million yuan.</p>
<p>Silk goods were also weak. Although real silk quilt covers were actively traded, prices did not rise. Huaqiang quilt covers were traded at the opening price of 10.72 million and 10.71 million yuan, then immediately traded at 10.7 million yuan spot, and 10.74 million yuan for delivery the next day. There was a slight increase after being pulled up in the middle, with next-day delivery at 10.78 million yuan, then dropped again. The spot price hovered around 10.7 million yuan, with no significant change at the close. The final price of Dazheng quilt covers was 10.75 million yuan, with next-day delivery asking price of 10.8 million yuan. Meiya quilt covers were not traded at 11.5 million yuan. Dazheng checkered crepe was listless and unable to rise. Market sentiment was wavering, and trading was quiet. The opening asking price was 6,000 yuan for selling, but no one asked. It then dropped to 5,500 yuan, and an offer of 5,000 yuan was not traded. As a result, someone wanted it for 35,200 yuan. Huajin crepe was 22,000 yuan in the morning, but in the afternoon, due to the drop in rayon prices, no one asked about it. Other goods were traded very sparsely and prices were also soft.</p>

<h3>Four Powers Allocate Small Japanese Warships; Disintegration of the Japanese Navy</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this newspaper, Fu Junyi</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th</p>
<p>Before the war, Japan was one of the two major naval powers, focusing on the navy from the beginning of its military build-up. In March of the third year of Meiji (1870), the Ministry of Military Affairs stated in the "Opinion on Establishing the Navy": "The strength of national power does not lie in the size of the military force, and the size of the military force is related to the amount of military expenditure. If we want to rise to prominence in the world in the future, we still need to discuss a strategy of focusing national power to expand the navy." At the beginning of the Japanese navy's ship building, most warships were purchased from Europe, and technicians were also hired from abroad. In 1872, the strength of the Japanese navy was only 14 ships, totaling 12,352 tons. The largest warship, the "Tsukuba" (襲), was only 2,530 tons. After 1870, due to disputes with the Qing Dynasty over the issue of the Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan, Japan's shipbuilding target was to counter the Qing Dynasty fleet. The Qing Dynasty's two major battleships, the "Dingyuan" and "Zhenyuan," were both 7,335-ton ironclad ships, while Japan's largest cruisers, the "Itsukushima," "Matsushima," and "Hashidate," were only 4,300 tons.</p>
<p>After the Sino-Japanese War in the late Qing Dynasty, Japan's shipbuilding target was to counter the Russian Far East Fleet. At that time, most warships were purchased from Britain. Later, the power of the U.S. Navy rose, and after the naval arms limitation conference, Japan's shipbuilding target changed. Its hypothetical enemy turned to the United States, and it expected a day when Japan and the United States would engage in close combat on the Pacific Ocean. It deliberately planned to strike first and win in a short-term operation, and finally launched an unprovoked war, playing the ugly drama of the Pearl Harbor attack. The Japanese called it a strategy of "attacking with initiative." The characteristic of Japan's shipbuilding in the later period was to focus on this point. That is, it adopted the doctrine of big guns and giant ships, overemphasizing offensive capabilities while reducing the space occupied by crew members and defensive capabilities. Once encountering a powerful aircraft carrier air force attack, it was at a loss and struggled to cope, and the entire army was wiped out. After the Pearl Harbor attack, the Japanese navy suffered a crushing defeat in the four major naval battles: the Coral Sea Battle, the Battle of Midway, the Battle of Saipan, and the Battle of the Philippine Sea. The treasures of the Japanese fleet, the two battleships "Yamato" and "Musashi" that boasted to the world, could not save the defeat of the Japanese navy. The "Yamato" sank in the Battle of Okinawa, and the "Musashi" sank in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, finally unable to withstand the final blow of the American aircraft carrier aircraft. The Japanese navy was almost completely lost in this war. The detailed figures are as follows:</p>
<p>Table of Japanese Ship Losses During the War</p>
<p>Each of the First Batch of Japanese Ships Gets Eight Ships</p>
<p>The Potsdam Declaration stipulated that the Japanese army and navy should be completely disarmed. After Japan surrendered, the Navy dissolved itself. Regarding the disposal of the remaining warships, U.S. Ambassador to the Allied Council for Japan Acheson said at the Allied Council for Japan on September 18, 1946: Large warships larger than submarines will either be dismantled and destroyed or sunk. However, some of them will be used for repatriation. After the repatriation is completed, they will be dismantled and destroyed. The weapons used by the warships will also be destroyed. According to the announcement by MacArthur Headquarters on September 28th of last year: In addition to the destroyers used for repatriation, other large warships will be dismantled and destroyed in accordance with the Commander-in-Chief's order. The amount of waste obtained will reach 158,180 tons. This work is expected to be completed this year. Currently, 21,010 tons have been destroyed, accounting for 13.3% of the total tonnage. The total displacement of the destroyed warships is 395,171 tons. It is said that in addition to the 131 ships used for repatriation, there are still some ships driven by the Japanese for patrol purposes. According to the regulations of the MacArthur Headquarters, after the Japanese army is disarmed, all weapons should be handed over to the U.S. military for safekeeping and destruction, but a part can be submitted as souvenirs and war trophies. The U.S. Navy Far East Command specially proposed 96 remaining Japanese ships (including 24 destroyers, 68 escort ships, and 4 transport ships) to be divided among the four countries of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union by lottery. It was held in three batches. The first batch was held on the 24th of last month at the first mutual building of MacArthur Headquarters. The ceremony was quite grand. Participants included our country's representative, Navy Colonel Ma Deting, U.S. representative Colonel Byrd (Chief of Staff of the Far East Naval Command), British representative Colonel Settidge, and Soviet representative Major General Stiyego. The first batch of ships allocated was 32 ships, including 12 destroyers and 20 escort ships, with eight ships for each country. What our country drew was the best of them. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>Table of Japanese Ships Allocated to Our Country for the First Time</p>
<p>The first batch of ships allocated to our country sailed from Sasebo to Shanghai on July 1st. The second lottery was also held on the morning of the 17th at the U.S. Navy Far East Command. The attending representatives were the same as the first time, with each country receiving eight ships. Britain received 8,910 tons, the United States received 8,660 tons, the Soviet Union received 8,450 tons, and our country received 8,450 tons. The quality was far inferior to the previous time, mostly produced in 1945. The types are as follows:</p>
<p>Ship Name Ship Type Year of Construction Tonnage</p>
<p>Tsuta Destroyer 1943-1945 1580</p>
<p>Sugi Same as above Same as above 1530</p>
<p>No. 118 First-Class Escort Ship 1944-1945 900</p>
<p>No. 198 Same as above Same as above Same as above</p>
<p>No. 192 Same as above Same as above Same as above</p>
<p>No. 205 Second-Class Escort Ship Same as above 810</p>
<p>No. 85 Same as above Same as above Same as above</p>
<p>Tsushima Escort Ship 1939 1020</p>
<p>The second batch of Japanese ships drawn will open to Shanghai on the 26th of this month. The third lottery has 32 ships and will be held in August. The ships drawn have no weapons and equipment. The four countries of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union are still discussing how to allocate the fourth batch of 48 ships.</p>
<p>Differing Opinions on the Quality of Japanese Ships</p>
<p>Regarding the significance of this allocation of Japanese ships, Military Representative Colonel Ma Dejian said: "Although the warships obtained this time are limited, their significance is very great. Our country's sea defense has been invaded by Japanese bandits for decades. After our eight years of unyielding resistance, not only has national shame been avenged, but we have also been able to share naval spoils of war alongside the great powers, which is infinitely glorious." Navy Major Zhong Hanbo, who escorted the first batch of ships back to the country, told reporters: "The escort ships obtained this time will provide some help to our country's sea defense of the South China Sea and the East and West Sand Islands. Because the Japanese ships are light and compact in structure, and the tonnage is relatively small, the amount of oil used is less, and five tons of fuel oil can travel 240 nautical miles. Various maintenance and repair work are suitable for Chinese technical conditions." Ito Masanori, a naval commentator before the war and current president of Kyodo News, told reporters regarding the merits and demerits of Japanese ships: "Japanese shipbuilding is mostly focused on strengthening combat power, that is, strengthening firepower as much as possible, while ignoring human habitability, that is, the space occupied by crew members is far less important than the space occupied by weapons. It is suitable for attack, but inferior in defense. If the battle lasts too long, the soldiers will easily feel tired, so it is not suitable for the operating conditions of the South Pacific. Although the speed is high, the endurance is small."</p>
<p>The weapons of the Japanese Navy have been destroyed, but the spiritual transformation of the Japanese demobilized naval personnel still needs the self-awareness of the Japanese and the supervision of the Allies.</p>

<h3>Record of the New Governor's Inauguration in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Cheng Zhizheng from this newspaper</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 25th (Airmail dispatch)</p>
<p>Since the departure of the former Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Mark Aitchison Young, on May 16th, the people of Hong Kong have been eagerly anticipating the arrival of the new Governor. Finally, today (July 25th), the new Governor, Sir Alexander William George Herder Grantham, arrived in Hong Kong, albeit belatedly! The atmosphere of peace and prosperity in Hong Kong was further enlivened, and despite the unfavorable weather, with rain falling all day, colorful flags fluttered, music filled the air, and the enthusiasm of all the residents remained high.</p>
<p>Heavy Rain, New Governor Flies In</p>
<p>Governor Grantham and his wife took a British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) special plane from Singapore this morning to Hong Kong. They were scheduled to arrive at Kai Tak Airport at 3:00 PM. However, due to the heavy rain that persisted throughout the afternoon, many people were concerned about the safety of the new Governor's flight and thought that he would not be able to arrive in Hong Kong today! Unexpectedly, just after 3:00 PM, the BOAC plane appeared in the clouds over Hong Kong. Soon, the pilot used his skillful expertise to land safely. The Governor disembarked first and shook hands with the acting Governor, McDougall, and the commanders of the naval, land, and air forces stationed in Hong Kong. The Governor was tall, bald, with piercing eyes, and appeared vigorous, showing no signs of fatigue from the journey. The Governor's wife was petite, standing almost a head shorter than the Governor. They rested in the airport lounge for a while, changed into the Governor's official uniform, and then boarded the "Golden Crown" special ship to cross the sea, arriving at Queen's Pier at 4:45 PM. A group of important officials, dignitaries, and foreign envoys were already lined up at the pier. After the Governor disembarked, he shook hands with the welcoming crowd, many of whom were old friends of the Governor, making the atmosphere particularly warm. Standing in the square outside the pier were detachments from the naval, land, and air forces. As the Governor stepped out of the pier, the band played the British national anthem, and the three armed forces saluted. The Governor returned the salute. Due to the heavy rain, there was no review of the troops. The Governor then proceeded by car to the Government House to rest.</p>
<p>Moving Speech Earns Applause</p>
<p>At 6:00 PM, a grand welcoming reception was held at the Entertainment Theatre. In addition to the Governor and his wife, the dignitaries seated on the stage included Admiral Power, Commander-in-Chief of the British Pacific Fleet, and over thirty others. Two bishops, dressed in red robes and wearing wigs, attracted the attention of many spectators. The lower level was occupied by ordinary guests and the press, while the upper level was filled with citizens. The theatre was packed to an unprecedented degree. The Governor, wearing formal attire, sat in the center, with a very serious demeanor. After the national anthem was played, Morse, the General Manager of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the citizens. Morse read a prepared speech fluently, which mainly consisted of praising the Governor with many customary remarks. Zhou Jiao Nian then recited the translation, while Tan Wen used regular script to write it on beautifully decorated pages, presumably as a souvenir for the Governor.</p>
<p>After a while, the Governor rose to give his reply. He did not have a prepared speech, but his remarks were not only well-organized and meaningful, but also melodious and moving. He said: Hong Kong is his second home. He had served in Hong Kong for twelve years in the past, and he was delighted to be back and see many old friends. He then spoke about the political and economic difficulties faced by many countries he had recently observed, with the United States being no exception. He acknowledged that Hong Kong had much to rebuild and was facing financial constraints, but he hoped to cooperate with the citizens and with friendly and great China to achieve the goal of Hong Kong's revival.</p>
<p>After his speech, the applause lasted for almost five minutes, which fully demonstrated how moving and sincere his speech was. After Zhou Jiao Nian translated it into Chinese, the Governor and his wife left first. They then rushed to the Legislative Council to be sworn in. The new Governor was quite busy that afternoon. When the British battleship HMS Belfast fired a 17-gun salute, the people of Hong Kong generally knew that the new Governor had officially taken office.</p>
<p>Revisiting Old Haunts with a Fresh Perspective</p>
<p>Sir Alexander Grantham graduated from Cambridge University and later received military training at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. During the First World War, he fought in France and Belgium, achieving remarkable military exploits. He came to Hong Kong in 1922, initially serving as a magistrate in the Central Magistracy, and later promoted to Assistant Colonial Secretary. He left Hong Kong in 1934 to attend the Imperial Defence College in the United Kingdom. In 1935, he was appointed Colonial Secretary of Bermuda. Three years later, he was transferred to Jamaica as Colonial Secretary. In 1941, he became Colonial Secretary of Nigeria. In 1945, he was knighted. In the same year, he was appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Fiji and High Commissioner for the Western Pacific. He was appointed to his current position this spring. He is forty-eight years old. His wife is from California, USA. They have been married for over a decade and have no children.</p>

<h3>Jiangxi's Rural Areas and Mining Industry</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Liu Zao</p>
<p>Nanchang, 20th (Airmail dispatch)</p>
<p>Jiangxi, known as the "Granary of Jiangyou," is experiencing economic decline in its rural areas. The poverty of more than 80% of its people is indescribably miserable. Last summer, people in "Dianshan" had no pork to eat. This year, Jiangxi people still do not have enough surplus grain to feed pigs.</p>
<p>The fertile land of Gan and the hardworking people of Jiangxi possess excellent conditions. Why is their life so desolate and miserable, turning the blessed land of the "Granary of Jiangyou" into a region of starvation and exile?</p>
<p>Banditry and war directly harm the rural areas, and their clutches have not yet been lifted. Currently, Jiangxi still bears the burden of huge amounts of military grain shipments and is also subject to various forms of extortion and high-interest exploitation. The people's hard work throughout the year, after the new grain is harvested, is barely enough to pay the state taxes and high-interest debts. The seeds left in their granaries for the next year are insufficient. Therefore, wild grass and grain husks are considered "blessings" for the poor.</p>
<p>The main reasons for the poverty in rural areas are: widespread wasteland, lack of manpower and livestock, insufficient fertilizer and medicine, and the harm caused by diseases and natural disasters. How to increase production in rural areas is the only way to solve the problem of the poor's livelihood.</p>
<p>Jiangxi's industry was lagging behind provinces like Hunan and Guangdong before the war. During the war, some foundations were established in southwestern Jiangxi. However, these industrial seedlings unexpectedly encountered the enemy's intrusion from south to north near the end of the war. Now they are under the pressure of high prices and wages, causing slow sales. The prospects for recovery are even more bleak.</p>
<p>During the war, Jiangxi's heavy industry included machinery, iron smelting, vehicle and shipbuilding, electrical engineering, sulfuric acid, and cement plants, jointly operated by the National Resources Commission (NRC) and the Jiangxi Provincial Government. Nine-tenths of these factories' facilities, buildings, and machinery were destroyed by the enemy, with losses amounting to at least 400 million yuan. As for light industry, the Provincial Industrial Development Corporation operated eleven factories, including alcohol, sugar, weaving and dyeing, hemp weaving, leather making, sawmills, porcelain, and printing. These were also damaged due to the enemy's repeated intrusions. Dozens of private factories producing matches, canned goods, textiles, and printing were all destroyed and closed down. Even Jingdezhen's porcelain industry, known throughout the world, originally had over 150 kilns, most of which were damaged during the war by enemy bombing. Now, less than one-third of them are operating again.</p>
<p>The tungsten mines in southern Jiangxi are a treasure among Jiangxi's mineral resources. According to official investigations, the total reserves in seventeen counties, including Dayu and Longnan, reach 4 million tons, ranking first in the world. Before the war, the annual output was 1,500 tons. In 1944, when the enemy intruded into southern Jiangxi from northern Guangdong, seizing the tungsten mines was one of their strategic objectives. As for the tungsten sand and ore beds, they were naturally thoroughly destroyed by the enemy, making it currently impossible to resume operations.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are the manganese mines and coal mines in Leping, as well as the coal regions in Pingxiang and Yugan counties. The total reserves are estimated at about 700 million tons, with an annual output of over 8 million tons. Before the war, the coal needed for the Nanxun Railway, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, various power plants in the province, and the Gan River transport ships was supplied by Jiangxi coal. Several large coal mines, such as Anyuan and Tianhe, were shut down due to wartime destruction, or because of transportation difficulties, making it impossible to transport and sell the coal. They are now awaiting large-scale financial assistance to resume operations.</p>
<p>According to general estimates, the total iron ore reserves in Jiangxi are about 20 million tons, with the best quality found in Wushi Mountain in Yongxin. Starting in 1942, 20 tons of pig iron could be produced daily. In 1944, it also suffered significant losses due to the enemy's destruction.</p>
<p>Judging from the mineral reserves in Jiangxi, they are not only sufficient to establish large-scale light industry, but also to earn huge amounts of foreign exchange. If it can be quickly restored to production and operation, the country's wealth and the province's finances will not only increase but can also solve the unemployment of some of the industrial and mining technicians.</p>
<p>During the journey of recovery, rural areas and the mining industry should receive appropriate relief and assistance. In the agricultural sector, Jiangxi has also implemented emergency relief, promoting the lending of plows, waterwheels, distributing seeds, fertilizers, and agricultural tools, building farmhouses, and constructing farmland water conservancy projects, carrying out cattle epidemic prevention, and pest control. These efforts directly or indirectly benefit the rural areas, especially the water conservancy projects. With the ¥100 million in relief funds for restoring dikes, the breaches and dangerous sections in Nanchang, Xinjian, and Yongxiu counties were completed, with earthwork totaling 6,120,377 cubic meters, 170 culverts, and a dike length of 780,530 meters, benefiting 880,654 mu of farmland. The dike restoration projects in sixteen counties, including Nanchang and Hukou, completed 38,832,220.13 cubic meters of earthwork and 13,634.50 cubic meters of stonework, benefiting 3,751,118 mu of farmland. In June of this year, the water levels of various rivers in Jiangxi rose sharply due to mountain floods, exceeding the historically high water levels, but the dikes in various places remained safe, and farmers were able to harvest a crop. This is a significant achievement in agricultural relief.</p>
<p>Amidst the calls for industrial recovery, Jiangxi's industrial and mining industries have suffered severe damage, and the strength of the relief efforts is pitifully weak, like a skilled woman unable to cook without rice! Although equipment allocated to China can be obtained cheaply and with preferential terms, Jiangxi's industrial sector lacks the resources to compete for these affordable factory equipment. Jiangxi natives residing in Beijing and Shanghai, such as Gui Yongqing, Liu Shiyi, and Liu Zhi, have repeatedly responded to the Jiangxi Relief Branch's initiative to seek industrial machinery. Although the preparatory committee for the Jiangxi Branch of the China Agricultural Machinery Company has been established, raising the ¥6 billion in capital is still proving difficult.</p>
<p>The current difficulty facing Jiangxi's rural and industrial and mining industries is the lack of its own economic strength, making it difficult to embark on a path of rapid recovery. However, according to the report given by the Jiangxi Branch at a press conference regarding the relief supplies allocated to Jiangxi by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), only over 27,000 tons were received from January to April of last year, less than one-fourth of Hunan's allocation.</p>
<p>Now, millions of agricultural and industrial workers are appealing to society, calling for more relief supplies to Jiangxi, especially for the industrial and mining industries, which are in even greater need of external assistance.</p>
<h3>The Life of Coking Expert Yu Zailin</h3>
<p>— Zhou Jian</p>
<p>Beiping, 20th (Airmail dispatch)</p>
<p>Mining and metallurgical expert Yu Zailin dedicated his life to the study of mining and was renowned both at home and abroad. This time, he stubbornly defended the Beipiao Coal Mine but unfortunately, the mine was captured by the Communist forces on July 2nd, and Mr. Yu died as a martyr. The loss of such a national talent is deeply mourned. This newspaper has reported the details. Gao Ping, the Director of the Beiping branch of the Central Geological Survey of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, was a close friend of Mr. Yu, having been classmates for four years and known each other for twenty-five years. He has written an article detailing Mr. Yu's life and deeds, which is quite comprehensive. We have recorded the main points as follows:</p>
<p>On July 4th, it was reported that the "news from Beipiao is unclear." I immediately telegraphed Lei Baohua, the General Manager of the Beipiao Coal Mining Company in Jinzhou, inquiring about the whereabouts of Yu Zailin, the person in charge of the Beipiao project. No reply was received. Suddenly, I received a telegram from Guo Xiangyu, the new General Manager of the Beipiao Coal Mine, bearing tragic news: "Beipiao was captured by the Communist forces on the 2nd, and Brother Zailin died a martyr." After reading it, I felt lost, still hoping that his words were untrue. On the 14th, I received news from Beipiao that the Communist forces had automatically retreated on the night of the 8th, and the National Army had safely stationed in the mining area on the 9th. Mr. Yu's martyrdom has also been confirmed, so Mr. Yu is dead! Alas! A few days ago, I received news from a friend in Jinzhou that Mr. Yu's body had been eaten by wild dogs, and only twelve white bones were found, which were wrapped in cotton and coffined in the Jinzhou Martyrs' Shrine on the 14th. Such a tragic death is infinitely mournful. I was a classmate with Mr. Yu for four years and a good friend for twenty-five years, so I know him very well. Therefore, I will describe Mr. Yu's life, to be forever remembered.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Zailin, also known as Zuiling, was a native of Sheng County, Zhejiang Province, born four years before the founding of the Republic of China. He was straightforward, chivalrous, and very refined in appearance. He studied diligently as a child and was always the top of his class. In 1922, he entered Anding Middle School in the provincial capital. His classmates respected his sincerity and responsibility, so he was elected as their representative. At that time, student movements were surging. Mr. Yu believed that young people like them should focus on their studies and tried to avoid getting involved. His classmates followed him, and the teachers loved him. I was very good friends with Mr. Yu, but we usually only discussed academic matters and did not talk about other things. He was a respected friend. After graduation, we went north together. Mr. Yu was admitted to Peiyang University. Two years later, he entered the Department of Mining and Metallurgy. After graduating in 1932, he worked at the Kailuan Mining Administration for two years. Due to his strong interest in research, he joined the Construction Committee and engaged in mining and metallurgical design work. Later, the Mining Office of the National Defense Design Committee (later known as the Mining and Metallurgical Research Institute of the Ministry of Economic Affairs) was established. Mr. Yu joined and specialized in the study of coal beneficiation and coking in various provinces. He wrote extensively. At that time, Mr. Yu had established a solid foundation in his career. He married Ms. Qian Aiqin, also from Sheng County. Ms. Qian graduated from Hangzhou Provincial High School. She was diligent and sincere. The couple shared the same ideals and their love was strong. At that time, rents in Nanjing were high, and civil servants' incomes were meager. Mr. and Mrs. Yu only rented a small room, and even the corridor during the day was used by others. I once visited them. Mr. Yu said that although their material life was hard, he had a strong interest in his work, which shows that his focus on research was the main reason for his later success.</p>
<p>When the August 13th Incident occurred, the enemy indiscriminately bombed Nanjing day and night. Mr. Yu sent his wife and children back to Sheng County first, while he remained at the Mining Office day and night. On the night of September 3rd of that year, a bomb hit the courtyard next door, and the doors and windows of the Mining Office were shattered. The flying tiles and stones almost killed Mr. Yu. After the air raid alarm was lifted, I immediately went to visit him (the Geological Survey and the Mining Office of the National Resources Commission were in the same gate). Mr. Yu, who had just regained his breath, was organizing the mining data and preparing to pack it for transportation. His spirit of not being careless in the face of danger and being responsible to the end was like this.</p>
<p>As the war escalated, the government moved from Nanjing to Wuhan, and from Wuhan to Chongqing. Mr. Yu carried all the books and instruments of the Mining Office, as well as his research records of the past few years, and moved westward. At that time, the Mining Office had been reorganized into the Mining and Metallurgical Research Institute of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and a new laboratory was rebuilt under Heguanyan, more than a hundred miles north of Chongqing, to continue research. However, the war situation took a sharp turn for the worse. North China and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River were abandoned. In the southwest, which was the rear area, a small-scale steel and town industry had to be established to continue the war of resistance. The Jurassic coal seams in Sichuan coal mines that could be used for metallurgical coking were too thin to be mined on a large scale. However, the Permian coal seams, which were thick, had too high sulfur and ash content and could not be used for metallurgy. Therefore, Mr. Yu conducted research and experiments in the laboratory on how to wash and coke the Permian coal with excessively high sulfur content in an economical and simple way, and he finally succeeded. At that time, some small iron smelting furnaces had been opened in Sichuan, and there was an urgent need for metallurgical coking coal. Mr. Yu then used the results of his experiments to establish an experimental coking plant in Maliutan, to supply the needs of various small iron smelting furnaces along the Jialing River. His contribution to the war of resistance and national reconstruction was great.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu was fair and impartial in his work. When running the coking plant, the plant built offices and dormitories for single employees. Although Mr. Yu was the plant director, he did not want to move his family there, but instead rented a simple house from the residents of Shuifengya. In 1941, when I visited Mr. Yu's residence, he already had two sons and a daughter. Due to the high prices, he could not afford to hire help. His wife worked very hard, and Mr. Yu traveled back and forth four times a day, rain or shine, without complaining.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1942, Mr. Yu was ordered by the National Resources Commission to go to the United States to study coal washing and coking. He was ordered to go in a hurry and left hastily. At that time, his wife had just given birth and was isolated in the mountains, lacking care. In addition, prices were soaring, and the salary was not enough to support his four children. A few days after Mr. Yu left, his wife suffered severe stimulation and became mentally deranged. Although various treatments were tried, they were ineffective. Separated by mountains and oceans, and in the midst of the World War, the journey was difficult, and he could not return to Shanghai. After Mr. Yu arrived in the United States, he was disturbed to hear about his wife's illness, but he still focused on his research, so as not to fail the government's expectations. He studied under Mr. Lawless at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh and often visited various mines for observation.</p>
<p>He gained a lot during his two years in the United States. In March 1945, Mr. Yu returned to China and resumed his old work. He established a larger coking plant in the Tianfu Coal Mine. At that time, the Production Bureau was established, and there was close Sino-American technical cooperation. American coal washing and coking experts were repeatedly sent to China and greatly admired Mr. Yu's design work. There are not many people like Mr. Yu, who have studied, practiced, researched, experimented, set up factories, gone abroad for observation, and then returned to China to expand the factories, in such a proper way with such excellent achievements.</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance, Mr. Yu was sent to the Northeast to assist in the takeover of the Fushun Coal Mine. After the task was completed, Mr. Yu felt that his expertise was not being used and that his sick wife and weak children were in urgent need of care. He requested leave to go to Sichuan and returned with his family to his native place of Sheng County. At that time, the situation in the Northeast improved, and the steel and machinery industry was about to start. There was an urgent need for a large production of metallurgical coking coal. The National Resources Commission asked Mr. Yu to go to the Northeast again last December to serve as the Chief of the Engineering Office of the Beipiao Coal Mine. The original plan was to greatly increase production to supply washed and coking coal to various steel and machinery factories. Unexpectedly, after he took office, Beipiao was repeatedly besieged by the Communist forces. Mr. Yu, with a strong sense of responsibility, never left the mine after arriving. In early June, I arrived in Fuxin, only two hundred miles from Beipiao. I telegraphed Mr. Yu, intending to meet him and visit the mine, but Mr. Yu replied that Beipiao was still tense and refused me to go. Unexpectedly, this was our last farewell.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu is survived by his sick wife, three sons, and two daughters, all young. The eldest is only thirteen years old. His death is extremely tragic. In his last letter to me last month, Mr. Yu said: "Last year, I returned south from Fushun and originally did not want to come to the Northeast again. Unexpectedly, Mr. Sun firmly insisted that I had to come to Beipiao. I was separated from my family, and there was no one to take care of the children. The monthly income of over 700,000 legal tender is not enough to feed my family. I feel like I am living in a tiger's den..." Reading it now, I am filled with sorrow!</p>
<p>The final paragraph of the article emphasizes that our country has limited talents, and it is not easy to cultivate them. It is hoped that the government will cherish technical talents like Yu Zailin in the future and, when necessary, order the technical personnel to evacuate first to preserve the nation's vitality, so as not to suffer great losses in the war.</p>

<h3>The Calf Without Fear - Sketches of Outer Mongolia</h3>
<p>From our news archives.</p>
<p>Outer Mongolia - this emerging nation, is just like a calf that does not fear the tiger. Towards China, including Xinjiang and Fan Huan-yuan, that overbearing attitude is quite astonishing.</p>
<p>Today, the inhabitants of Outer Mongolia are still living nomadic lives of primitive times, but at the same time, livestock farming provides the most nutritious foods for the people of Outer Mongolia, and their nomadic lives have also forged strong physiques for the people of Outer Mongolia. What's more, hidden beneath the vast desert are rich treasures: large amounts of lignite, soda, graphite, gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, antimony, sulfur, asbestos, etc., many of which are very important raw materials.</p>
<p>Outer Mongolia's natural endowment is very thick; it is well known that the Soviet Union covets it. Since the wave of Redness reached the silent and ancient Outer Mongolia, the Mongolian Communists have seized power from the lamas and princes, and established a new administrative system, implementing so-called socialist political and cultural activities in the vast desert area.</p>

<h3>Inquirer's Consultation · Recovery of Self-Use After Expiration of Fixed-Term Lease</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I have long admired your column's enthusiastic social service and its ability to solve readers' problems. I have several legal questions that I would like your column to take the time to answer to enlighten me. My friend, Mr. A, rented a spare house to Mr. B two years ago. At that time, it was stated that the term would be three years, and upon expiration, the landlord could unconditionally recover it for self-use. A contract was drawn up at the time with a middleman as witness. Now that the lease term is about to expire, Mr. A intends to recover the house for self-use. I have several questions: (1) (A) Should Mr. A notify Mr. B one month before the expiration of the term to prepare for the move? (B) If Mr. B makes excuses to delay, is it valid for Mr. A to resort to law? (C) When should Mr. A file a lawsuit? What are the procedures? (2) Is the contract established by both parties legally valid? Although the contract has been signed and sealed by both parties and the middleman, the middleman cannot be found. Is the contract still valid? Reader Zhang Zhiping</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Cao Yaxia] (1) (A) Notification should be given. (B) Valid. (C) Upon expiration of the term, a petition should first be submitted to the mediation committee of the district office in charge, or a request for mediation should be filed with the court. If mediation fails, a lawsuit should be filed with the court to confirm the termination of the lease relationship. Concrete proof of recovery for self-use must be provided, otherwise, it may be difficult to win the case. (2) Valid.</p>
<h3>Talent Wanted</h3>

<h3>Regarding Military Service Issues: Answering Reader Inquiries</h3>
<p>The first conscription in this city is about to begin. Currently, procedures for applying for exemption or deferment for strong young men are being handled. People from all walks of life are not fully aware of military service laws and conscription methods. This column has received numerous consultation letters on this topic in recent days, and it is impossible to answer them one by one. After investigation, Director Zhang of the Shanghai Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Department has given several detailed talks on the matter (please refer to the fourth page of this newspaper on the 25th and 27th), stating that if citizens are unclear about handling application procedures, they can inquire at the security section of the district office or at the Third Section of the Civil Affairs Department (address: 295 Tanggu Road, telephone 43610). This is written specifically in lieu of individual replies.</p>

<h3>The Formation of "Taiping Guangji"</h3>
<p>— Jing Youlin</p>
<p>Among the novels from the Han and Tang dynasties of China that are still available for our research and reference today, the contribution of "Taiping Guangji" is arguably the greatest. Due to the turmoil and dispersion of materials throughout history, many short passages that appeared in the bibliographies of past dynasties have completely disappeared in our time. In particular, general notebook novels and chuanqi stories, because they were not valued by the literati, were rarely preserved. By the time of Emperor Taizong of Song during the Taiping Xingguo era, the Chongwen Institute, the imperial library, had accumulated over 80,000 volumes. According to the "Remnants of the Song People" compiled, as quoted in "Huiqing Houlou":</p>
<p>"During the Taiping Xingguo era, all the surrendered kings died. Their former officials sometimes had grievances. Emperor Taizong employed them all, placing them in the imperial library to compile books, such as the *Cefu Yuangui*, the *Wenyuan Yinghua*, and the *Taiping Guangji*. He broadened their scope, increased their remuneration, and employed them to occupy their minds, many of whom died in the midst of their textual labors."</p>
<p>Although this passage reveals a sad history, Emperor Taizong's original intention was not for the sake of culture itself. However, in order to prevent the remnants of the Tang dynasty from rebelling again, he ordered the establishment of the Chongwen Institute, widely collecting books from all over the world and accommodating all nostalgic literati in the Chongwen Institute, providing generous support. Thus, literary legacies like "Taiping Guangji" and "Taiping Yulan," which preserved ancient books, were left to us. According to "Taiping Guangji," it collected materials from as many as 345 books, most of which have since been lost, making it a remarkable story in the history of novels.</p>
<p>However, "Taiping Guangji" did not receive the same level of attention as "Taiping Yulan" and "Wenyuan Yinghua" at the time. It is said that in the third month of the second year of Taiping Xingguo, an imperial decree was issued to compile the work, with Li Chu supervising. Xu Xuan, Wu Shu, and twelve others jointly compiled it. In the eighth month of the third year of Taiping Xingguo, the completed work was presented to the imperial court and sent to the historical archives. It remained in the historical archives for more than two years. In the first month of the sixth year, an imperial decree was finally issued to carve the printing plates. Unfortunately, someone who despised novels said to Emperor Taizong: "These remnants are not urgent for later scholars." As a result, the printing was stopped, and the original plates were stored in the Taiqing Tower. This placement lasted even longer. Throughout the entire Song dynasty, "Taiping Guangji" was never made available to the public. It was not until the mid-Ming dynasty that Tan Shi obtained a copy and had it printed and published. Therefore, even the people of the Song dynasty did not see this treasure.</p>
<p>"Taiping Guangji" consists of five hundred volumes, divided into ninety-two categories. It comprehensively collects various tales of foxes and ghosts, accounts of gods and spirits, strange objects and events, special figures, and various notebook novels from the Sui and Tang dynasties. This allows us today to know something about the true face of novels from the Han, Wei, Six Dynasties, Sui, Tang, and Five Dynasties. This treasure has fulfilled its greatest function.</p>
<h3>In the Rain</h3>
<p>— Ge Shangde</p>
<p>The rain was obviously much heavier than when I got on the tram. Water trickled through the cracks in the carriage, wetting the seats. The passengers' faces were filled with anxiety and resentment, but they all remained silently quiet. The carriage was in a state of suppressed breathing.</p>
<p>The tram arrived at a stop, and some passengers braved the rain to get off. Since I had reached my destination, I also got off. Next to the station was a high wall, and only the awning of a newsstand offered temporary shelter. I joined several passengers and hurriedly ran to this awning to escape the rain.</p>
<p>The rain continued to intensify.</p>
<p>The awning was small and crowded. My upper body, being closer to the awning, was somewhat sheltered, but my lower body was getting wet and dirty due to the direct impact of the raindrops and the splashing mud from the water accumulating on the awning and pouring onto the ground.</p>
<p>The awning had some holes, and some of the accumulated water dripped through the holes, making my upper body also slightly wet.</p>
<p>Everyone was anxious, but they remained silent, allowing the heavy rain to control their actions.</p>
<p>Several trams passed by the stop, but no passengers got off. They probably chose a stop with better shelter down the line.</p>
<p>Cars sped through the rain, their tires splashing water like waves. Raindrops hit the street, making a rustling sound.</p>
<p>"Is business good every day?" A young woman who appeared to be a student asked the newsstand owner, breaking the silence among the group of people temporarily gathered together.</p>
<p>"Business is not very good, but we manage to get by," the owner replied.</p>
<p>Only then did I begin to notice the female owner. She was thin, her face even more gaunt, but still somewhat rosy. She wore a blue cloth cheongsam that suited her well. She had rain boots on her feet, without socks. She was about forty years old. Her demeanor was very gentle, and her accent was quite soft. She spoke with a natural smile.</p>
<p>As the two were talking, a car stopped abruptly in front of the newsstand. There was only a driver inside, and he reached out to buy a particular tabloid from the female owner. The female owner skillfully picked out the paper from the rack and handed it to the driver. The car then drove away.</p>
<p>"The old gentleman in this car passes by here every day and always buys a tabloid to read. Sometimes when the air force passes by, the driver buys it for them," the female owner recounted to the young woman.</p>
<p>I lingered under the awning for about half an hour. When the heavy rain turned into a drizzle and the sky began to clear, I left. By then, the other shelter-seekers, including the young woman, had also gradually departed. During that approximately half-hour period, I never saw the female owner express any animosity towards these "uninvited guests." On the contrary, she was always kind and approachable, always showing a genuine smile.</p>
<p>I was deeply moved by her great spirit of "helping others in need."</p>
<p>The next day, it was noon on a day when the scorching sun was raging. I passed by the newsstand again on business. To my disappointment, I did not see the female owner. Instead, a young boy was there, carrying out her duties. I couldn't help but stop and stare at the boy for a long time. He was probably the female owner's child. He was about eleven or twelve years old and quite sturdy. On his round, plump face and in his clear, lively eyes, shone the same warmth, harmony, and sincerity as his mother.</p>
<p>As I left him, I couldn't help but worry about him. The awning that had blocked the rain yesterday would soon be unable to shield him from the scorching sunlight gradually shifting westward. Could he endure the torment of the raging sun?</p>
<p>I sincerely and silently blessed the mother and son!</p>
<h3>More Miscellaneous Poems</h3>
<p>— Li Chucai</p>
<p>Leaving Daan at dawn, passing through Mian County, Bao City, Liuba, Miaotai, and Feng County, crossing the Qin Mountains, passing through Dasanguan, Yimen Town, crossing the Wei River, and then entering Chencang.</p>
<p>Two or three li in the sky over Daan, cheap walnuts fill the sandbars; people in the town sleep soundly in their homes, travelers have already crossed thousands of green mountains.</p>
<p>The water around Wuhou Temple flows gently, the traveler's heart is lost beside Mian County; the altar where he claimed kingship to support the Han is gone, but the wind and clouds still swirl around Mount Dingjun.</p>
<p>In Bao City, I ask about farming, noon clouds like cotton batting rise above the mountains; since ancient times, the only comfort is a smile, who knows that the downfall of a kingdom comes from just one bewitching beauty?</p>
<p>Liuba is surprisingly deserted, (the county town was disturbed by bandits in the past, residents were relocated to the surrounding villages, and it is still an empty town today.) I happily see the cypresses thriving in Miaotai; for a thousand years, people have valued the loyalty of Han Xin, I cast a fleeting glance and vainly yearn for the ancients! (Miaotai is located in Zibai Mountain, named after the location of Zhang Liang's temple. The scenery is very beautiful, but I was in a hurry and did not have time to go in and admire it.)</p>
<p>The peaks of Feng County are high, opening in all four directions, (the county town is located in the Fengling Mountains) that year, my elder brother passed by here, most of my family has also passed through, I should offer a cup to the mountain spirits to thank them. (In the early years of the Republic of China, my late father, Mr. Jia Erbaichuan, served as the Daoyin of the Shaanxi Southern Observation Envoy's Office. After the War of Resistance, my wife Huiyun and our children went from Shaanxi to Chongqing. My second nephew, Xiongbo, and his wife and children, who worked at the provincial bank in Hanzhong and Chenggu, also passed through here.)</p>
<p>The Qin clouds cover the Qin Mountains, concealing the Qin Pass, countless bays of mountains under the pass; since ancient times, many have defended this place in war, now I still feel stirred.</p>
<p>The Wei River flows horizontally outside Yimen Town, I have been welcoming Guanhe in my eyes for ten years; I happily arrive at Chencang after crossing the water, the old land of Qin stirs my emotions the most!</p>
<h3>An Emei Minor Song</h3>
<p>— Chang Lan</p>
<p>Milky Way</p>
<p>On a summer night, lying on a bamboo bed, looking at the Milky Way that traverses the night sky, only the sweet memories of childhood will be brought to you.</p>
<p>Memory, like a misty dusk, is as ethereal as a dream, clear, but when you try to capture it, it is like a cunning spirit, quietly slipping away, leaving you without a trace. ...</p>
<p>On such a night, I thought of that lost childhood, thought of the stories about the Milky Way on that summer night.</p>
<p>...The sunflower bid farewell to the setting sun and drooped its head sadly. The weaver and some small insects of unknown names sang monotonous elegies for the lost daylight.</p>
<p>The sultriness will disappear in the bursts of evening breeze, and we innocently ask our grandmother to tell us the story of the Milky Way.</p>
<p>Grandmother, with a face covered with wrinkles, smiled kindly, she said:</p>
<p>In ancient times, a herdboy and a weaving girl in heaven, how they built a deep love, it is said that when their "fate" was full, the Queen Mother of the West—that cruel old woman—used her silver hairpin to draw a deep chasm on the firmament, that bright silver chasm, is the Milky Way. This great trench cruelly separated the lovers in passionate love. Only those kind birds, at the deep noon on July 7th, built a light magpie bridge for them, so that they could pour out the feelings they had accumulated in their hearts for years. Their tears flowed and turned into raindrops....</p>
<p>We all listened silently, stirring slight waves in our childhood hearts, and we began to lament the ups and downs of fate for that couple.</p>
<p>...Old grandmother has left us for many years, only that Milky Way that shines brightly in the night sky is still the same as it used to be.</p>
<p>Let me pray for the soul of my grandmother to rest in peace, and let me bless that affectionate couple.</p>
<p>Fireflies</p>
<p>Fireflies, flying in the summer night, although their brilliance is so weak and small. But they brought children so much joy and excitement.</p>
<p>When the moon is bright and hangs in the middle of the sky, when the stars are shining brightly. You may ignore the existence of fireflies, maybe you saw them, but you despise their smallness and weak light, but when there are no stars and moon at night, their preciousness can be revealed.</p>
<p>But the fireflies do not care about this, they fly, they use their weak light to mark many small loopholes in the whole night.</p>
<p>They do not exaggerate their abilities, seeking to complete the feeling of "I am the only one," nor do they despise themselves, scorning their own incompetence. A pioneer once said, "If you have one point of light, give off one point of heat." Fireflies complete the fulfillment of life and the meaning of work.</p>
<p>Lament</p>
<p>The new moon, like an eyebrow, makes people think of the brilliance on the face of a saint, and think of the innocent faces of children.</p>
<p>Moonlight, like light gauze, covers the noise of the world. It is quiet, gentle, but she uses her affectionate hands to open the gates of memory for every dreamy person.</p>
<p>The past years seem to be a plain white and beautiful flower, blooming in a distant, unattainable place. Far away on the other side of the mountain, on the other side of the water, a friend makes me draw a wisp of long silk of longing... These, for me, seem to have an inseparable blood relationship with the moonlit night, because, I regret that "the long string of stories played under the moon, I remember the past like smoke, I remember that companion who scattered like a meteor in an unknowable place. .............</p>
<p>Who is it? Singing a pair of songs on the other side of the forest.</p>
<p>I have a beautiful illusion.</p>
<p>Lost beside the meteor...</p>
<p>…………………………</p>
<p>…………………………</p>
<p>Tonight, are you still standing by the window, letting the moon, like water, melt into your eyes as deep as the sea?</p>
<p>Tonight, a chilling melancholy, mixed with the light of the new moon, quietly flows from the depths of my heart....</p>
<h3>Siesta</h3>
<p>— Sezanne</p>
<p>Cezanne (Paul Cezanne 1839-1906) was a famous painter of the nineteenth century, the founder of modern painting, but he was a person who never entered an art school and came out entirely by self-study. He was naturally withdrawn and arrogant, and he rarely looked up to anyone except Zola (Emilezola).</p>
<p>He denied the impressionist claim of being enslaved by "light," and he further described the quality and quantity of "objects" other than light in a subjective attitude. He made figures, still lifes, and landscapes, but still lifes were the most famous. This work is a representative work of figure painting in the mature period.</p>
<h3>Random Collection of Figures</h3>
<p>— Zhongyuan</p>
<p>Flower</p>
<p>She is an eighteen-year-old girl.</p>
<p>The first time I saw her in the hazy moonlight, her long, oval face was as white as if it had been smeared with cream. She had two short braids, waved a hexagonal fan, saw me, smiled, and followed her sixty-year-old American "Grandma" and came over: "Wellcome!". It is a delicate and gentle fragrance.</p>
<p>So familiar! Familiar, but I can't remember it. I rashly held her little hand and asked, "Do you know me?"</p>
<p>"Of course I know! Isn't your name called ×××?"</p>
<p>"Yes! How do you know me?"</p>
<p>"In Mogan Mountain; in Suzhou; and in many publications and magazines..."</p>
<p>"Oh!..."</p>
<p>I blushed with shame. How could I not! This innocent girl said she knew me. Know my poverty? Know my stubbornness? Or know my...?…</p>
<p>I lowered my head and was speechless.</p>
<p>The "party" began, and the girl sang softly. Her voice was soft at first; then it was loud; finally, like a flying arrow rushing straight into the sky, and then quickly trembling and falling; then the whole world and the moon seemed to change color!</p>
<p>On the way home, my friend and I discussed the girl.</p>
<p>"It's amazing! This girl will definitely be a great singer when she returns from studying abroad!" my friend said excitedly.</p>
<p>"Yes, maybe," I replied.</p>
<p>"She is so beautiful, really like a beautiful little warbler!" my friend said again.</p>
<p>"Yes, she is very beautiful. But she is not a beautiful little warbler, but a beautiful carnation!" I said.</p>
<p>"Why are you so stubborn?" my friend laughed: "Little warblers, carnations, birds and flowers, aren't they all cute? What's the difference?"</p>
<p>I gently replied to my friend:</p>
<p>"There is a difference, birds soar in the free sky, sing loudly for their own happiness, and dance for their own joy. Flowers will always thrive in wet mud and be grasped in the hands of flower arrangers. Do you envy the noble bouquet of carnations in the bride's hand! Why don't you go and see the firm lead wire firmly tied behind them!"</p>
<p>Saying that, I sighed inexplicably, so my friend was also silent.</p>
<p>Dog</p>
<p>I don't know if it's because everyone calls him "Ah Gou", his body gradually looks like a dog.</p>
<p>His head is bent downwards, his cheekbones are raised, and his two incomplete ears are strangely curled up. A high thing bulged on his back, and a young master from a neighboring family who could write poetry saw it and shouted, "A terrible decapitation blade is tightly pressed on his thin back!"</p>
<p>But Ah Gou didn't understand anything, he raised his head in fear and asked, "Young master! Do you still need to pull weeds in the flower circle today?"</p>
<p>Ah Gou's hoarse and unpleasant voice drove away the young master's "poetic mood", he got angry, and waved his hand: "I don't know, go ask the wife!"</p>
<p>The wife said it was needed, Ah Gou jumped up happily, as if God allowed him: "You can live one more day!"</p>
<p>So Ah Gou smiled, he went to the garden to pull weeds with a pleasant smile.</p>
<p>I also smiled, I went to the window with a faint bitter smile to watch him pull weeds.</p>
<p>I saw the thick and hard weeds growing deep in the soil, Ah Gou hummed and pulled hard. …</p>
<p>I saw the fiery sun hanging high in the sky, and the sweat on Ah Gou's back was flowing like rain. …</p>
<p>I saw the garden door suddenly opened, a child in western clothes and a pair of fashionable Pekingese dogs jumped in. "Woof woof woof..." The Pekingese dogs rushed towards Ah Gou, wanting to bite him.</p>
<p>"Young master..." Ah Gou cried out in a hurry.</p>
<p>"Hahahaha!" It was the young master's burst of hearty laughter.</p>
<p>Ah Gou was running, the Pekingese dogs were chasing, and the young master was clapping and following behind.</p>
<p>They ran too fast, chased too fast, and followed too fast. In the strong sunlight, it was gradually impossible to see clearly! I only saw three white and heavy things, turning quickly in the garden...</p>
<p>"Which pair is the dog?" I asked myself at my window.</p>
<p>"Which one is the dog?" I am still asking myself today.</p>
<h3>One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of River, One Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Alas!" Yaojun seemed to have been heavily hammered in the heart; even an ordinary girl, discovering the evidence of unrequited love for the first time, was not as disappointed and uncomfortable as she was at this moment.</p>
<p>"That can't be blamed on you," I quickly comforted her: "I know you have made the greatest efforts; in other words, even if Mr. Tsurumi or Mr. W were to exchange places with you, they would probably only be able to do this much, maybe even less."</p>
<p>"..." Yaojun's lips trembled, wanting to say something, but she didn't say it.</p>
<p>"You know I never tell lies, and I never like to flatter people... Lies are useless to you and will only delay things... Anyway, I'm here now, maybe I can't do anything else, but I guarantee the speed of communications—you know, I've already exchanged messages four or five times yesterday."</p>
<p>"No wonder you wanted to exchange information as soon as you arrived. I thought you wanted to know a little bit about what happened last night... It turns out my reports have been suppressed by the postal and telegraph bureaus. Even in wartime, they shouldn't be suppressed so slowly, it's really unexpected... Counting to last night, there are at least ten important reports—both postal and telegraph—I think that is the usual way of Anchang." Yaojun's spirit had recovered a lot, but she was not as happy as just now.</p>
<p>Yaojun then sent out the reports that had already been sent, picking out the most important ones, and I listened and wrote them down. After Yaojun finished speaking, I reviewed the few items I had written down again, and after obtaining Yaojun's consent, I called Dasanzi "04" and told him to send these messages to the two secret stations in Beiping and Tokyo using our usual code, and also asked him to add a message stating that I and Yaojun and others had met; we would talk about the rest later. When "04" was about to leave, I asked Little Tiger to guide him to find the car he needed and to get back here before twelve o'clock, bringing back more food—I was planning to have a good talk with Yaojun and Dingyuan, and then plan the work to be done.</p>
<p>Little Tiger and Dasanzi went out together; but only a few minutes later, Little Tiger suddenly returned; I thought he had forgotten something, or had something to ask. I was looking at him when I saw his round eyes roll twice, and he smiled and told us, "Captain Shen said he knew the way and also knew the big tree where the car was parked, so..."</p>
<p>Yaojun smiled when she heard it. Looking at her expression, I knew that this little thing was not honest and must be lying. But in fact, he can't be blamed. He was definitely not lazy, but because we were all here, he was a little reluctant to leave; partly he wanted to listen to our conversation, and partly, it was the nature of a child, who likes to join in the fun. For these two reasons, he probably told Dasanzi the route and the parking location, telling him to find it himself; but he was also afraid that Yaojun and I would blame him, so he used Dasanzi as a scapegoat.</p>
<p>"Very good," Yaojun looked at her watch and said to Little Tiger, "It's almost eight o'clock now. I was originally scheduled to talk to that Shaofu buyer, but now I'll trouble you to take a trip and tell him at the office that I can't leave and ask him to come back at five or six o'clock in the afternoon. If he hasn't arrived yet, you can inform Lao Long and ask him to tell him instead... Go and come back."</p>
<p>Shanghai Vignettes</p>
<h3>Shanghai Residents Spending Summer</h3>
<p>— Shi Lang</p>
<p>Reading "New Yorkers Spending Summer" fills one with a myriad of emotions.</p>
<p>Many people yearn for the luxurious life in Shanghai: air conditioning, cold drinks, watermelons, refrigerators… who wouldn't be moved? When talking about living, there are garden villas; when talking about entertainment, there are classy dance halls; when talking about eating, there are rich and comfortable dining seats… However, these are merely for the enjoyment of a small number of wealthy and privileged families.</p>
<p>When New Yorkers reach the "dog days" of over a hundred degrees, the whole family goes to the beach to have a great time. There, regardless of age, status, or wealth, during this "summer break" weather, they spend several evenings by the surging waves and soft, grassy sand of the beach. How can that not dispel the heat?</p>
<p>But, for Shanghai residents, let alone beach swimming, what fraction of them can even afford to go to a swimming pool?</p>
<p>Some people don't even have a place to wash off the sweat every day. A basin the size of a washbasin for a quick wash is already considered "keeping up with the times." The equipment of "porcelain basins" and "shower heads" is beyond their imagination.</p>
<p>And once night falls, they are squeezed onto the streets in "pigeon coops" as if scorched by fire. Other than enjoying a bit of evening breeze in a breezy spot, where else can they go to spend this hot and stifling long night?</p>
<p>Especially those coolies, rickshaw pullers, sweating profusely at the docks, carrying heavy loads, pulling carts, carrying heavy burdens, letting the sun of around a hundred degrees scorch their skin, while those cold drinks with raw water bacteria, with the hand of "death", beckon to them!</p>
<p>This scorching and merciless fire is burning more than three million distressed Shanghai residents. Above their heads, under their feet, around them, it's all fire-like heat!</p>
<p>Epidemics, acute illnesses, are following them, attacking them. In these hot summers, they have already lost the ability to resist.</p>
<p>Can you imagine those barefoot coolies and rickshaw pullers on the asphalt roads, flying around?</p>
<p>You cannot possibly imagine how Shanghai residents spend their summer.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>Personalities</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Zhang Jia'ao</h3>
<p>— Meng Long</p>
<p>My knowledge of Zhang Jia'ao dates back more than twenty years. At that time, he seemed to be in the form of a businessman, and his name was not known to the world as "Jia'ao." Everyone called him "Mr. Gongquan." Perhaps because of this reason, some people jokingly referred to "Gongquan" as a business name, and considered "Jia'ao" as an official name. In reality, it is one and two, two and one. This is the same as being called "Zhou Shuren" ("Yucai") when working at the Ministry of Education, and "Lu Xun" when writing articles. There is no distinction between official, private, political, or business, and no mystery involved.</p>
<p>But Zhang Jia'ao has his own mysterious side. According to a friend, he has many special hobbies, and the arrangement of his home is very unique to suit his hobbies. For example, when you enter his reception room, you may realize that he is a prominent financier with a taste. In the past, many years ago, I can't remember exactly, a friend designed a wonderful carpet for him. Its style and pattern are exactly the same as the pattern on the five-yuan banknote of the Bank of China, except that it is enlarged a hundred times in area. If viewed by a nearsighted person, it would be mistaken for a banknote lying on the floor.</p>
<p>Regarding his marriage, many mysterious stories are also circulating in society. As far as I know, since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, Zhang Jia'ao has moved inland with the national army to serve the country. He has won wide praise for his work in the economic war of resistance. At that time, his family members, including his wife, Madam Chen, stayed behind, still living in a fairly luxurious mansion on Ga'en Road. At that time, it was generally speculated that Mrs. Zhang had moved west with Mr. Zhang, but this was just wishful thinking, because she rarely went out and had little contact with the outside world, so it was not noticed by people. Unfortunately, her life was taken away by illness the year before last, and Zhang Jia'ao's grief is beyond words. Ms. Chen came from a prominent family. She was the daughter of Chen Baiwan, a well-known figure in Shanghai during the late Qing Dynasty. When they got married, it caused a sensation inside and outside Shanghai, and it was said that Ms. Chen's dowry was so abundant that it amounted to "eighteen Arhats." Although this is not true, the luxurious situation can indeed be inferred from this.</p>
<p>The problem of remarriage has always been a matter of Zhang Jia'ao's daily consideration. This marriage between Zhou Bixia and Zhang can be regarded as a renewal of old acquaintances and a repayment of a debt of love. The new wife, Ms. Bixia, is good at socializing. When she flew from Ping to Shanghai this time, she refused to show her face and covered her face with a fan. Secretary Lu from the Central Bank even labored to defend her, saying that she was not Mrs. Zhang but Mrs. Zhu. Therefore, many people were confused. Many people thought that Mrs. Zhang was shy and afraid of people talking about the interesting story of "white hair and rosy cheeks," or the comparison of pear blossoms and crabapples. In fact, readers don't need to worry about her. She is well-known in the social circle and has a close friendship with Zhang's two younger sisters. She has known Mr. Zhang for several years. Last year, there was once a rumor that they had secretly married in Shanghai, but it was soon said to be untrue. All these rumors added a lot of mystery to the marriage process of Zhang and Zhou. The main reason is not because of "white hair and rosy cheeks," but because Mr. Zhang is engaged in politics and is afraid of affecting reporters' coverage.</p>
<h3>The Growth of Hair</h3>
<p>— Dongfang Jing</p>
<p>Humans have hair from the moment they sit down, and they take it to the coffin when they die. However, in between birth and death, people know very little about hair. This is truly an inexcusable ignorance.</p>
<p>A fetus starts to grow hair six months before birth. Hair stops growing only when the heart stops beating. It is a misconception that the hair of dead people can also grow because it is the contraction of the muscle tissue of the dead that leads to the mistaken belief that the hair is still growing.</p>
<p>Sunlight has no relation to the structure and amount of hair, and cutting hair has no effect on hair growth.</p>
<p>The color of hair is determined by a pigment that the human body makes itself and stores in the hair follicles. Decreased pigment production in the body causes hair to gradually turn gray or white. Individual hairs do not fade, but after they fall out, the hairs that grow back contain less pigment.</p>
<p>Premature graying is often due to the following three reasons: (1) insufficient hair pigment in the body; (2) severe nervous system diseases, including excessive worry and anxiety; (3) suffering from typhoid fever and other diseases.</p>
<p>Currently, science has no way to enable the human body to produce enough pigment. Vitamin treatment or other medical methods are ineffective.</p>
<p>The ancients said, "Anger makes the hair stand on end." We all thought it was just a literary description. However, in fact, hair can stand up one by one. When we are greatly frightened or cold, the hair stands up.</p>
<p>Hair has a lot of pulling power. A single hair can hold a quarter of a pound of weight. At the same time, hair is elastic. It can be stretched by one-fifth and can shrink back like a rubber band. According to experiments, wet hair can be stretched by 70% without breaking. In steam and boiling water, hair can be stretched by 100%.</p>
<p>Hair grows fastest when it first comes out of the scalp, averaging three-quarters of an inch per month. Then it grows more slowly. The lifespan of hair is about six months to four years, but a new hair grows out immediately after the old one falls out. Even if you pull the hair out by the roots, new hair will still grow, but it will take six to twelve weeks to grow out.</p>
<p>If you want to dye your hair, you should think twice. Dermatologists believe that any dye is harmful to hair and will make hair lose its natural shine. As for perms, they are harmful and unprofitable except for the hairdresser.</p>
<p>If hair falls out after a major illness, it doesn't matter. Once the body is fully recovered, the hair will grow back.</p>
<p>There are about four ways to keep your hair healthy: (1) comb your hair more often; (2) massage your scalp more often; (3) wash your hair often to keep your scalp clean; (4) avoid emotional obstacles.</p>
<h3>Big Difference</h3>
<p>— Ge Chunliang</p>
<p>Mrs. Deng and Mrs. He had not met for several months. "I heard," Mrs. Deng said, "that your son and your daughter are both married, congratulations!"</p>
<p>"Thank you," Mrs. He said.</p>
<p>"How is your daughter? How is she doing these days?"</p>
<p>"Very good," Mrs. He replied. "She has a very good and considerate husband. She has breakfast in bed every day, and she doesn't even have to lift a finger for anything. Every afternoon, she goes shopping after eating, and then plays cards. She is truly a blessed woman."</p>
<p>"Then, what about your son?" Mrs. Deng continued to ask.</p>
<p>Mrs. He sighed and said, "Alas, my son, that child is so pitiful. I'm afraid he's not doing very well these days. His wife is so lazy, a born lazybones. She doesn't get up until ten o'clock every day, and she doesn't even move a finger for anything in the house. Every afternoon, she spends most of the day playing cards. Alas, Mrs. Deng, she is truly a lazy slut!"</p>
<h3>Liang Zu and the Big Willow Tree</h3>
<p>— You Jin</p>
<p>Those who are used to hearing flattering words cannot listen to honest advice. However, the principle that "bitter medicine is good for illness, and frank words are beneficial for conduct" is clearly and plainly there.</p>
<p>Zou Ji of Qi knew that his appearance was not as beautiful as Mr. Xu of the north of the city, but his wife favored him, his concubine feared him, and his friends asked him for favors. They all praised him, saying that he was more beautiful than Mr. Xu of the north of the city. This made Zou Ji realize the harm of being blinded. He advised the King of Qi with this, so that Qi could happily accept the truth and not be blinded by flattering words. As a result, the State of Qi "won battles in the court." This is the best positive example.</p>
<p>Generally, those who are good at flattering do not understand the righteousness; people who understand the righteousness mostly do not like to be flattered by others. Historically, the distinction between loyal and treacherous officials lies only in whether they are willing to speak frankly.</p>
<p>Ming Zheng Xuan's Yesterday's Non-Hermitage Compilation contains the following short story:</p>
<p>"Liang Zu wanted to seek out honest and frank men. One day, he suddenly stopped under a tall willow tree. The trees were countable.</p>
<p>Liang Zu said to himself: What a big willow bridge! He stared at the guests for a long time. The guests each avoided their seats and replied: What a big willow tree! Zu also said: It can be used as a cart shaft. Several people in the last seat rose and replied: It is good to be a cart shaft. Zu said sternly: How can a willow tree be used as a cart shaft! Qin Shi pointed at a deer and called it a horse, is there anything more difficult than this! All those who said it could be used as a cart shaft were killed. Alas! To die for speaking honestly, what is the benefit of flattering!"</p>
<p>The guests mentioned here who echoed the voice, like parrots learning to speak, were of roughly two types; one was desperately flattering, taking yes-saying as loyalty, hoping to win favor by echoing the voice, fearing to offend the will of the superiors. The other was mediocre, like a cold toad croaking, even though they knew in their hearts that it was wrong, they were unable to speak out, and could only follow suit and say "What a big willow tree" and "It is good to be a cart shaft."</p>
<p>However, the crime of pointing to a deer and calling it a horse is the greatest. Liang Zu killed them all indiscriminately, which was certainly enough to be a warning and a secret. However, it was inevitable to blame people silently. If he really wanted people to speak frankly and dare to pick out faults, why didn't he openly say: "Don't do the same as before and specialize in echoing, you should speak out your true thoughts." I think someone among the guests would definitely dare to say that the willow tree cannot be used as a cart shaft. Why set up a tree in vain to show one's own fondness for killing? Liang Zu's approach was so wrong that it was simply unreasonable.</p>
<p>"The crime of lengthening the ruler's evil is small, the crime of echoing the ruler's evil is great." Following behind Liang Zu and echoing like a mouthpiece, killing them all indiscriminately is certainly not completely unjust, but to seek honest and frank men, to actually adopt such means, is something that later generations dare not compliment.</p>
<p>Genuine democracy should be like the gentle breeze under the willow tree, with harmony as the priority. To set up "What a big willow tree" and "It is good to be a cart shaft" to trick guests into being fooled, and then to kill them, is a kind of violent atmosphere. As a result, honest and frank men are bound to be nowhere to be found.</p>
<h3>Between Husband and Wife</h3>
<p>— Ming Sen</p>
<p>Economic problems—E.D. Maurer studied 466 divorce cases, and he found that economic difficulties were the main cause in 30 to 40 percent of them. However, G.V. Hamilton, in his book "A Research on Marriage," put forward another explanation: disputes over money are often just manifestations of other fundamental disharmonies in married life.</p>
<p>Women who are unhappy after marriage often look for excuses to express their dissatisfaction. She will never think that she might have some fault; she just nitpicks and looks for her husband's shortcomings. And using economic problems to nag him is one of the most convenient excuses.</p>
<p>Poor health—If it is true, this can be regarded as the most understandable reason for the wives to be garrulous. Many women keep their complaints until their menstrual period comes, and then they erupt once or several times regardless. Some women use illness as an excuse to avoid sexual life that they hate, or as an excuse for not being good housewives. When they feel unwell, garrulous women believe that they have every right to make some complaints.</p>
<p>Donna Wright's simple principle for achieving happiness between couples is: "Show affection! Show appreciation!" Learn to tolerate others, their thoughts, desires, and lifestyles.</p>
<p>Scientific Essay</p>
<h3>The Wonderful Life of Cockroaches (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Tianhong</p>
<p>"Paleontologists" who carefully study fossils of prehistoric animals often see a small animal that they are very familiar with—the cockroach—with traces of prints on it. Of the countless animals that lived in the Paleozoic "Carboniferous Period," from the huge and terrifying "dinosaurs," only cockroaches have survived to this day. It has experienced 216 million years of great changes and disasters, and not only still exists, but has hardly changed or evolved at all.</p>
<p>Most people find cockroaches to be filthy and disgusting things, often coming to our homes as uninvited guests, annoyingly sharing our food and dormitories. But let us say a fair word for it: it is a very clever and intelligent little animal—it is entirely by its own intelligence that it has triumphed over dinosaurs and huge prehistoric animals and multiplied to the present. It is the old senior in the insect world; in the way of life, it can even give us humans many lessons.</p>
<p>The secret that has enabled cockroaches to continue to exist for more than 200 million years is, first of all, that their sex life is wisely moderate. Most insects continue to engage in courtship and reproduction after they grow up, consuming all their energy. Cockroaches are not like this. They only mate in spring. As soon as their offspring are born, they make a nest for them and lovingly take care of them until they can live independently.</p>
<p>At least in one respect, the way of life of cockroaches is superior to that of humans: they never fight among themselves, but know how to respect the rights of other members of their kind. If a nest of cockroaches has established a family in a certain corner, other cockroaches will not invade it. They will not even kill each other over delicious food.</p>
<p>Cockroaches are not particular about food at all; they will eat anything. Powder mud on the walls, broken old shoes and cardboard boxes, plaster lime, medicines... are all listed on its acceptable food list. Even for ink, oilcloth, and torn cloth scraps, it will be as happy as if it had seen meat, bread, and potatoes. Sometimes, seemingly for novelty, it will sneak onto you while you are sleeping and nibble on your eyelashes and fingernails.</p>
<p>And when times are bad, cockroaches can eat nothing at all. A scientist once locked a cockroach in a large bottle without giving them any food; after seventy-six days, they were still alive. When he released them, they were very weak from hunger and their bodies were emaciated! But they did not immediately gobble up and overeat themselves to death; in the first few days after being released, they only ate a little food until their digestion returned to normal, and then gradually increased their food intake.</p>
<h3>Miscellany of Travel in America</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>Sources of funding for American schools</p>
<p>China, known to the world for its long-standing culture, seems to have reached the point of bankruptcy in education. Schools are bound to raise tuition fees due to a shortage of funds. Ordinary poor students are forced to beg for scholarships on the streets, which truly fits the saying "culture swept the floor." Studying in this environment is bound to be asking for trouble. American schools are not as grand as Chinese schools in architecture, and they do not have as many faculty and staff as Chinese schools. In addition to running schools seriously, they are not very interested in political struggles and party disputes, and they are even less willing to treat schools as battlefields. American private schools do not receive much help from the government. But they also have abundant funds, which are not raised by students begging along the way, but are mostly donated by wealthy people. Since the implementation of income tax and inheritance tax in the United States, wealth has been greatly hit. In order to avoid heavy taxes, the wealthy would rather donate most of their property to schools. On the one hand, they can evade taxes, and on the other hand, they can enjoy fame, which is much more glorious than paying into the national treasury silently. Therefore, famous universities such as Jianfo have the richest school property in the world, and they cannot use it all in another hundred years. There is a Rice Institute in Xiaoshi Dun, which was donated by an oil tycoon. The land covers thousands of acres, and students are completely free of charge and receive subsidies. However, the admission standards are extremely high. This is a university for high-achieving students, and those who want to mix diplomas cannot enter. Texas Provincial School is also famous for its rich school property, and Texas is a coal and oil producing area. Many ordinary people have become giant merchants overnight because oil mines have been opened on their pastures, and they take money very lightly. Donating tens of thousands of dollars is not a big deal. Americans have a strange temper. They would rather donate all their property to schools than let their children be cattle and horses. The opposite is true for Orientals. There are many tycoons in Shanghai who gnaw on pancakes and fried dough sticks all day long, but their children squander money in dance halls and casinos. If the education authorities can use their brains in this regard, many students will be saved from sweating and weeping in the scorching sun. (3) (1)</p>
