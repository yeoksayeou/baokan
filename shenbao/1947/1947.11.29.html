<h3>蘇聯主張在華召開　四外長特別會議　答覆我國對日和會建議</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿八日電〕莫斯科電台廿八日廣播，中國前時提出建議，折衷美·蘇兩方對日本和約程序之立塲，莫洛托夫已予以答覆，建議在明年一月中舉行四外長特別會議，討論對日和約之籌備事項，蘇聯並建議會議在中國舉行。電合復稱：蘇駐華代辦費特倫柯已將覆文提交中國。（下接二版一欄）</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿七日合衆電〕蘇外長莫洛托夫，廿七日在外長會議中宣稱：如欲保證世界和平對日本之和約，實與對德和約同樣重要，此爲莫民首次在四外長會議中叙述日本問題。各方相信，目前會議中，對遠東問題不致作正式考慮，因會議原定僅討論歐洲問題也。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕莫洛托夫在倫敦外長會議席上提及對日和約如何云爾之訊傳抵此間後，關係方面稱：此或係莫氏縱論世事後偶爾提及之語，蓋如於任何塲合討論對日和約，而不得中國參與，則必難獲得吾人之贊同。渠信，莫氏及其他三外長，均不致作徒勞之舉。</p>
<h3>我尚未表示態度美英將予以拒絕</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕關於蘇聯政府建議中·美·英·蘇外長會議特別會於明年一月在華舉行，準備對日和約問題，外交部高級官員廿日晚宣稱：「外部尙未獲悉是項建議之詳盡內容，不能即刻表明能度，唯於對日和會準備會議之舉行地點，我方並無意見，吾人所要求者，爲正式和會應在我國舉行。」按蘇聯此新建議，似與其前所表明並堅持之立塲並無若何差異，均主張由外長會議處理對日和約準備問題，然是否可解決目前美·蘇間　局，大成問題。至若蘇聯如係以此次建議間接拒絕我國於十七日提出關於召開對日和約初步會跌之折衝建議，則對優局之解決，將更增困難，</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電﹞美國對於蘇聯建議中·蘇·英·美四國外長明年一月在中國舉行特別會議事表示冷淡。美國外交當局認此爲蘇聯故態復萌，擬使大國包辦太平洋和約，一如包辦對　和約然。美國原會主張由積極對日作戰之十一國共同眾擬對日和約，蘇聯未能同意，另提大國主持之　，美國已於九月問加以拒絕。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>兩黨一致對華政策的醞釀</h3>
<p>自美國國會召開特別會議討論援歐援華問題以來，美國朝野的視綫都集中在援華問題上，除了美國各報紛紛撰文評論援華問題而外，共和黨的領袖范登堡·杜威·馬丁·屬以德諸氏，亦相繼發表公開演說，無不主張美國應立即全面援助中國。其中尤以杜威於廿四日在哥倫比大學所發表的援華六項辦法，最惹人注意，這六項具髓辦法：　以七千五百萬至一萬萬美元，作為緊急援華之用；　每年以二萬五千萬美元援助中國，為期以兰年或四年為限；　額外助以小額貸款，用以向美國購買軍事配備及其他軍需品；　美國太平洋地區所有之剩餘物資，立即供給中國國軍應用；　美國應立即派遣軍事人員前往中國，充任中國陸軍之技術顧問；　任命「人員」人，管理援華事務，此人员之人選，不僅須洞悉中國實情，而且對於政治經濟社會有廣泛的訓練。</p>
<p>紐約州長的六項主張，不特為我國朝野所一致歡迎，而且在美國與論界也引起良好的反響。例如美國援華聯合會募款運動委員會主席柏萊恩對比，也深表贊同，並指出中國人民之眾多，　於歐洲，而其所遭受戰災之苦難，又较歐洲人民為深，故中國之需要美援，甚至较歐洲各國，尤為迫切，向來主張援歐第一的紐約泰晤士報，對於杜威的演說，也非常重視，除将其演辭金文五千言一次刋登而外，並認為杜威的演辭，是共和黨諸領袖會商擬定的。由此可知，杜威的六項計劃，實可目為美國共和黨的對華政策。</p>
<p>戰後美國的外交政策，「直是採取兩黨（民主黨共和黨）一致的致策，不僅在美國出席歷屆國際會議的代表國之中，常常有共和黨的領袖參加在内，而且對歐所探版的杜　　主義與馬歇爾計劃，也無一不為共和黨所贊成。但是按之美國現行遠東政策，不論從那一個角度去觀察，在民生黨與共和黨之間，尙有若干距離存在。以杜魯門主義而論，對於歐洲業巳推行，但迄今尙未擴大及遠東；以馬歇爾計劃而　，美國政府刻正致力於援歐計劃的實施，但對於遠東，終覺得不够熱烈。例如馬歇爾於本月十一日在參眾兩院外交委員會席上所攪出的援華計劃，其主要的内容有兩點：　美國在明年七月一日以前，将撥六千萬美元援助中國；　美國在明年七月三十日以後、將每月以二千萬美元援助中國，至一九四九年七月一日為止，總額為三萬萬美元、即使我們站在第三者的立塲，從「及時」與「分置」二個角度去觀察，都覺得馬歇爾的援華計劃，未必能奏效。因為大家都認為美國援華，有如醫生之用葉，不僅須及時，而且藥的分景、也耍「恰到好處」，過了時，藥就會失效；分量不足，也就等於零。所以時至今日，美國政府常局應該特別重視共和黨領袖對於援華問題的意見，而設法調和·也探取雨黨一致的對華政策。否則至下屆總統競選時，對華政策，將為民主共和兩黨競選的材料了。但是我們考察一下美國輿論界對於援華問題的意見，就不難證明，今日的美國人民，無一不願與中國保持戰時密切的盟誼，共同維持太平洋的和平；更無一不願援助苦難的中國，早日成為和平統一强大的中國·所以我预料将来，兩黨若以援華問題為競選的材料，則共和黨必能獲得更多選民的擁護，是無可疑義的。</p>
<p>我們只要打開世界地圖，中美兩國遠隔一個太平洋，以現代最新式的交通工具，往來一次，最快也需要五大天的工夫；美國對於中國，從來沒有過領土的野心，在近代史上，到處可以找到有力的證明。但是中國地大物博，人口眾多，文化悠久，不僅使美國極願與中國為友，且使美國極欲與中國往來貿易，兩國均站在互惠平等的立場，共同促進中美經濟的文化的合作；美國在辛丑條約時代高呼的口號是一門戶開放」，「機會均等」；華府會議的時候，美國則要求列强尊重中國領土完整，主權獨立；迨至抗戰期間，美國更進一步與中國結為同盟，携手合作，確保戰爭的勝利；復至勝利之後，美國又協助我國復員。所以近年來，又使美國方面，增添了一個新的認識，就是認淸了中國在遠東的重要性，質言之，将來美國不論對日或對蘇聯，如若沒有中國做美國的盟邦，則從戰略上看來，美國就難扭轉乾坤，從劣勢變為優勢了，所以美國要中國成為和平統一强大的民主國家。</p>
<p>所以我们始格相信，杜魯門總統與馬歇爾國務卿，對於中國在遠東的重要性，決不會忽視而鑄成大錯的，馬歇爾國務卿對於中國，尤具热忱，當其奉杜魯門總統之命來華調處的時候，曾為中國的和平統一盡最大的努力；其他命雖未完成，但是他的熱情深深地印在我國民族的心版上，永遠不會忘懷。最近他所提出的援華計劃，以及時而論，似乎太遲，以分量而言，不免太輕；但是他關切中國的局勢，願意援助中國和平統一，是始終一貫的。前幾天他曾致函中央日報記者，表示他關切中國所遭遇困難的心情，並聲明其三億美元援華計劃，不國是援華的初步而已。所以我們實在有充分的理由，可以相信。美國民主黨與共和黨對於援華問題，在目前雖然還有相當的距離，有緩急與輕重之分，但是不難調和，而獲得兩黨一致的對華政策，目前可謂巳在醞釀之中了。</p>
<h3>蘇建議內容</h3>
<p>（上接一版）莫斯科電台廣播詞全文如後：「一般皆知，中，美，英，蘇四強擔負對日戰爭之主要責任，當戰爭尙在進行中，業已明切獲得有關戰後和平條件問題之協議。開羅宣言，雅爾達協定及波茨坦宣言亦曾反映此點。再者，根據波茨坦決議，遠東和平解決問題，係由外長會議負責，中國在此方面當參加此會議，在戰爭結束後，英，美，蘇三國得中國之參預，於一九四五年十二月在莫斯科締結協定，決議四國參加盟國對日管制委員會，並決定在華盛頓之遠東委員會採納上述四國代表協議條件之決議，此點，各國在有關日本戰後地位問題之特殊利益上，亦加以承認」。</p>
<p>「貴國照會所建議有關對日和約程序各項，亦根據對上述四個特殊利益之承認，貴國建議表示採納中，美，英，蘇代表對日和約協議之各項決定，然貴國照會建議召開對日初步和會，上述四國前時之決議中，對此並無規定，並與設立外長會議之波茨坦決議抵觸，且阻碍遠東和平之恢復。」</p>
<p>「故為早日恢復遠東和平計，為使日本及其人民享有和平發展之條件計，蘇聯政府於一九四八年一月召開外長會議，由中，美，英，蘇代表參加，討論日本和約籌備事項。」</p>
<p>「如中國政府認為需要，則蘇聯建議特別會議在中國舉行，如貴國對此能早日答覆，本人將銘佩不止，如中國政府及其他兩國政府均吿同意籌備事項能及早完成，本人亦將向英，美兩政府傳致相同之建議。」</p>

<h3>黃元彬談美援華　助我改革幣制實為黨務之急</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿八日電〕全國經濟委員會委員黃元彬氏，頃就美援華問題發表談話如次：美國援華現正逐漸開端，連糧食救濟與棉花貸款計之，約有下列各項：　糧食救濟：按中美救濟款項中，以三千萬美金在國外治購糧食，此批食糧，雙方於運華後在沿海大都市配售，藉以平抑物價，然後再以售價在内地購買糧食，救濟難民。　棉花贷款七千萬美元。　馬歇爾原定援華計劃三億元。　美眾議院外交委員會通過臨時援華案六千萬美元，查本案當為前項之補充。以作緊急之救濟。</p>
<p>就整個援華問題而言，此四項之救濟及援助自極微小，惟援華開端伊始，綜合救濟貸款及援助三方面同時進行，對於我國目前經濟與軍事之危機，雖難克服，而暫時穩定經濟之局面，自有相當貢獻。蓋此後進口貿易配額，政府不須負担棉花糧食及其他援助物品進口之外匯頭寸，自可擴張必需原料與生產器材之進口限額，以足供國内工廠之需要為度，則進口走私自可逐漸减少，外匯黑市之需求方面亦因而大减，自可望壓平外匯黑市價格，又因物资之相常供應，物價亦可望有相當之穩定。</p>
<p>然美國援華問题經此初步之行動，除軍事上之援助外，亟應以改革幣個之援助為當務之急，蓋貨幣問題不解決，財政收入之實際購買力，唯有日益减小，適足以助長貨幣之膨脹。又在現階段經濟之病態下，黃金美鈔之投機與貨物之囤積，無法避免，生產建設無從談起。又因對外匯　不合理，出口與華僑匯款頗雖順利，祇有改革幣制，以改變國民對貨幣之信心。然後對上述各種病態，始能根本消除。而改革幣制是否成功，全視能否因此而恢復抗戰前之物價水準為斷。在改革幣制過程期間，凡有足以阻碍恢復抗戰前物價水準之因素，均須愼重剔除，而根本問題，則全在是否有雄厚之外匯基金，現在政府尙握有四億美元之外匯基金，茍能再加以五億美元之備用，目可着手改革幣制，而達到上述之目的，然此種信用，祇是信用而已，茍能依照主席批交財部之改革幣制计劃付諸實施，余敢保證在兩年以内，斷不至動用此項信用也。</p>
<p>又黃氏稱：本人原擬月杪赴粵，視察華南經濟，現因尙有若干事務正待處理，恐須延期赴粤。</p>
<h3>周以德談話　美應立即切實援華</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕眾議員周以總今日宣稱：中國方面共產黨威脅如不消滅，馬歇爾長期援歐計劃必歸失敗：吾人茍不立即切實援助，則中國定必受共產黨控制，此種局勢如發生，則馬歇爾援歐計劃必不能有成。英國及西歐其他各國之復興，端賴遠東貿易，蘇聯如控制遠東，則歐洲復興必遇暗礁，此種理論，固極簡單。余對於國務卿馬歇爾之對華政策，完全反對，此種政策即為吾人停止援華，以待其自行解決對共問題，惟共產黨志在控制全中國，不欲與國民政府妥協，吾人如不援助國民政府，共產黨即無法擊滅。美國援華之數較援歐為小，中國方面共產威脅一且消滅，则中國經濟機構尙健全，財政援助不必甚大。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦廿八日電〕四外長今日舉行第四次會議。在昨日之會議中，英外相貝文及美國務卿馬歇爾，同時支持皮杜爾所要求設立兩專家委員會，以審査德國東西疆界之議，以及蘇外長莫洛托夫關於德國未來中央政府之主張，而莫洛托夫對於皮杜爾對在目前即予討論。貝文馬歇爾雖支持德國中央政府之設立，惟聲明該一政府，須以維護眞正民主自由之憲法爲據。貝文並力言該一政府之性質茍不予明晰規定，則可能成爲傀儡政府，卒至再度引起獨裁制之危險。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿七日電〕外長會議第三日，仍無進展可言。法外長皮杜爾要求設立德國邊界委員會提出建議時，曾暢述德人口過密對於全世界所具之威脅。渠力言在討論德和約之前，必先決定德國疆界，否則在國界米定之狀態下討論和約，亦屬無用。渠指出目前須就兩主要事項成立決議，一爲制止人民之繼續移人德國，一爲確保德國鄰邦之安全，建立其經濟復興的有利條件。皮柱爾於述及薩爾問題時，釋明德國之將薩爾併入法國經濟制度，動機在完遂當地居民之意見。關於魯爾及萊茵兩區，因與安全有關，渠當於下次會中詳爲申述。皮杜爾旋乃提出兩項具體建議：　關於疆界問題，凡可望成立原則上協議之土地要求，發交專家硏究，此外之土地要求，交外長代表審査。　關於人口問題，除業已核准者外，不得再准許移入，流亡人民不許永久居住德國。德人之移居國外，與國際組織協商決定之。</p>
<p>蘇外長莫洛托夫聲稱，蘇聯雖知疆界問題之重要及法國欲於目前提出此一問題之用意，惟認疆界問題應爲整個條約及有關問題之部。外長會議係討論對德和約，並非討論設立疆界委員會之問題。莫洛托夫嗣乃提出蘇聯代表團之建議，渠謂根據已往就，　組織全德民主政府；　討論對德和約草案之和會；及　準備對德和約基本指令等三點所成立之決議。蘇代表團提出下列諸點建議：　承認建立全德民主政府，係遵照波茨坦會議之決議，　決定在召開德國和會之際，應使德國政府陳述關於和約之意見；　對德和約應由一德國政府簽字，由其向德國會提出批准；　參加德國和會之國，應爲中英美蘇法五强，與德國昆鄰之諸同盟國，及會派軍隊參加對德戰爭之諸同盟國。（莫洛托夫所列舉者共十九國，包括阿爾巴尼亞而不包括伊朗及巴基斯坦）　承認雅爾達及波茨坦之決議爲對德和約之基礎。</p>

<p>據新省宣委會主委兼西北行　秘書長，同時兼任該團團長劉孟純氏，於昨日招待新聞界時稱：新省民放複雜，維族最多，該團即以維族爲骨幹組成者。兩月前張治中出巡，見各地維族所表演之歌舞，頗能代表新省地方文化，爲促成新省民族與漢民族間之瞭解起見，特就南北　最優秀之歌舞人才中挑選數十人，在啓程前一週匆促組成訪問團，故在南京露演時尙屬全疆歌舞巨星集體合作之首次演出。彼等居處大都距迪化一千餘里，自聞組團訪問內地之消息後，興奮無已，特將住屋退租，衣服典賣，換得金錢，</p>
<h3>維族之花拒蘇邀演</h3>
<p>維族個性極强，該團各團員均自信其歌舞藝術並不在世界歌舞藝術水準之下，因之在滬演出時，彼等成主不收門票則已，如舊票則價格必須超過梅蘭芳座價。十二月六日起預定在皇后公演一星期後，將再擇一廣塲作公開表演，票價則儘量减低，俾求普過。該團女演員康波拉漢小姐，有「維族之花」之號，蘇聯會屢次邀渠出國獻演，均爲渠拒絕，在南京演出時，批評家認爲渠之歌舞造詣，確有獨特過人之處。</p>
<p>該團一行來　後，預定住宿華山路靑年館。留滬期內，並將以上海爲背景，邀何非光編導一歌舞劇，由西北影業公司拍攝影片一部，以留紀念。</p>

<h3>煤油價格擅自增加　社局據報　將予適當處置</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市煤油價格，規定須經物價評議委員會通過後公吿施行。最近煤油商，因外匯與配類隨時有調整，遂未經呈請物價評議會通過，即由同業公會核議決定後飭會員遵行，但物價評議會燃料組，方於第十四次會議中，將煤油價格調整，每桶五十三加侖爲三百二十萬元，零售每提一萬元，並自十一月二十四日起施行。今煤油商自定價格，已爲每桶三百九十二萬三千元。社會局據報後，將予適當處置。</p>
<h3>關員勾串商人舞弊一千萬萬　獲犯十三名正進行審訊　有關進出口行自動停業</h3>
<p>國防部於日前奉最高當局交下關於江海關若干中級職員勾串商人舞弊達千億元之鉅之密報一件，派李處長來滬調査屬實，於廿二日會同警備部稽査處逮捕有關人犯，迄廿六日止，共逮捕十三名，李處長即於是晚返京報吿。開案情可能尙有重大發展。據悉：十三人犯現押南市某處，正進行審訊，其中除有欺名爲海關職員外，餘爲進出口商人及「跑關份子」，開設於九江路花旗銀行大樓內之某進出口行負責人毛某，即爲重要人犯之一，毛某及該行數職員均已被捕，談行因此已吿自動停業。</p>

<h3>冬季慘痛經驗　特別謹慎將事促進飛行安全</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕冬季來臨，各界對於空航之安全問題，甚爲關切。昨據航空界高級人員談稱：鑒於去年客機一再失事之慘痛經　本年冬季之飛行將特別謹愼從事，設備方面因限於物力，未能飛躍改進，但如盲目降落之雷達設備，大都已經裝置，機塲之夜航新設備不久亦可裝妥。此外對於氣候之變化，將特別注重，在某種氣候情形之下，停止飛行之規定，將予嚴格執行·同時在每次飛行前之檢査已責令負責人　嚴密從事，對於飛機之載重量亦予嚴格限制，務期盡力促進飛行安全。</p>
<h3>民食調配會會議決定五種米價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民食調配委員會昨開第八次委員會議，討論提案，　計口授油自十一月份開始，每斤一萬元，大口一斤，小口半斤。（成本約需一萬六千元）　中央信託局自香港運滬遷米二千七百公噸，折合三萬四千餘市石。其中頭號米（5％碎米）約七千三百石，二號米（10％碎米）約六千七百石，三號米（15％）約三千石，四號米（20％碎米）約五千石，五號米（全碎）約一萬二千石，經核定價格一號二號三號米每石爲二十四萬元，四號五號米每石爲十六萬八千元，以便配售。　工人申請配售物品，前經規定必須　　國民身份證，現因甚多工人尚未領得，爲頗及困難情形，定自明年一月開始繳驗。　第二期工人配售煤球現正在審核中。昨日會中並迫認通過配售冬令救濟委員會緬米五百石，每石二十四萬元，以應各庇寒所急需。</p>
<h3>救濟經費意外收入　戰時一筆美金英鎊英銀行可隨時歸還　市府決利用籌建庇寒所</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕木市冬令救濟費緊急籌募聲中，市府突接獲一筆意外經費，數目甚爲可觀，爲美金八千八百五十元，及英金三百零八鎊。　　：該款係於民國二十七年存入英商滙豐銀行，總自拉戰爆發後，各地　民紛紛來滬達難，亟需救濟，本市各慈善團體，遂組織遣送難民回鄉委員會，並發動籌募經費，爲數頗　，惜尙未全部動用，而翌年國軍即吿撤離，該款遂存入匯豐銀行保管，迄今已達十年。際此冬令救濟費尙無着落之際，匯豐銀行負責人業向吳市長　實詳吿，表示隨時即可歸還市府。吳市長得悉後，當即邀　顏　慶，吳開先，沈宗濂等組織五人小組會，商討動用辦法，由顏惠慶爲召集人，經開會議決，將談款充作冬令救濟之用。昨據市府沈秘書長吿記者稱：市府方面已決定利用該款籌辦一較具規模之庇寒所，計劃建築足容三百人之棚屋一所。舉凡棉衣·棉被·鞋帽·膳食等，一概免費供給。被收容每日必須作工，工資照給，每日工資業經決定爲每天一萬元至一萬五千元，俾積少成多，俟冬令過後，即可作爲謀生資本。沈秘書長並希望能成爲社會主範，盼各慈善社團能相　效法，各別籌辦庇寒所，則本市冬令救濟問題，即可吿解決矣。</p>
<h3>紅十字會籌基金舉行古今書畫展</h3>
<p>紅十字會總會爲本年度籌募基金，特請各畫家許士　敎授，發動大規模徵集京滬名作家捐助作品運動，分東西兩會塲陳列，西會塲假成都路中國畫苑舉行，陳列宋·元·明·淸歷代畫畫價跡百餘件，東會傷假南京路國貨公司樓上中國藝苑，陳列當代名作家出品于右任。戴傳　。陳其采·沈尹默·許士騏等書畫二百餘件。下月三日閉幕。</p>
<h3>貴族化的罷工　江海關堅拒引水員要求　吊銷執照招募新員俄籍兩人應徵工作</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕江海關引水員，要求增加引水費不遂罷工事，昨日尙未解決，海關常局拒絕引水員要求之態度甚爲堅決，海務司賽勃爾下令吊銷罷工引水員之執照，並不准進入海關辦公室，昨晨有兩外籍引水員仍岡在辦公室中坐等，後經港務警察「勸駕」外出。</p>
<p>一方面海關公吿招募引水員，昨日已有前會受美軍雇用後移交與海關而於本年五月底解雇之兩俄人“C－Pilot”前來應徵，且巳開始工作，其一引導傑勃遜公司之麥斯克輪出口，另一引導戈果里輪轉泊碼頭。華籍引水員前往登記者，據引水員辦事處稱亦有五六人，但其資格尙待審査。</p>
<h3>要求每月實收·約合美金三千</h3>
<p>同時航政局方面決予盡力協助維持，日內即將指派華籍引水員工作。據海關負責人談稱：不論此次罷工之引水員將從此解雇抑或恢復工作，一二日內外洋輪船進出口，仍可照常暢通。</p>
<p>引水員之引水公會，祗有會員廿二人，內有華籍引水兩人。該會組織嚴密，外人絕難輕易入會，戰前每一會員名額，可獲三四千美金之鉅。彼等平均每日引水工作，約十一艘左右，所得收入，以百分之四十五作會中開支，其餘則由廿二人平均分派，故收入極高。引水費係照船隻之吃水與噸位計算，由船公司結美金給府·依十一月份引水費計算，每一引水員實際一月收入約有六千萬元，其中六百萬元，由我政府特許，以一萬二千元對美金一元之官價，結售美金五百元，故一般人對此次引水人員罷工會喩爲「貴族化的罷工」。據引水公會負責人向海關常局要求，今後應增加之數額，約合每人每月實收美金三千元之數。</p>
<h3>目前所得·高出英美</h3>
<p>按引水員在各國任何港口，薪金均極高昂，然目前本市引水員之收入，已較倫敦，紐約等港口約高四分之一。</p>
<p>據悉：戈登將軍號與傑佛遜總統號兩輪，因引水員罷工問題遷延未決，留滬一日，將多耗美金九千元，故已於昨日由駁船領水出口。</p>
<h3>雙槍盜判刑十四年</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕搶刦俄婦黑査自備汽車之「雙槍盜」，昨在地院刑一庭由胡之超推事判決：陳詹士處有期從刑十四年，　奪公權十年，手槍二枝沒收，陳聞判低頭不語，由法警押下。</p>
<h3>新華貿易公司·私套外匯嫌疑　大同興囤紙近千令</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕金陵東路廿五號新華貿易公司，因有私套外匯嫌疑，昨被警局査獲。除當塲抄出密電碼及賬册外，並截獲永安街永安坊七號協源行職員陳大守前往結付之支票九億元。惟該公司經理黃詩田在港未返，故由進出口部負責人　玉章到局應訊。又該局昨在北京西路五號大同興紙號及其古嶺路人安里廿二號堆棧內抄獲囤紙九九二令。</p>
<h3>越劇院中賊踪　紅衣女郎竊遠</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕西藏路國泰越劇院，廿六日夜塲有杭州中年婦人　項氏購票入座，手上戴有七克拉鑽戒一枚，光耀奪目，未幾忽有一紅衣女郎　領四五歲女孩一口，就旁坐下，與氏攀談，後見氏將手上之鑽戒脫下，放入一紅色腰圓形皮包內，即置於坐位旁，該女郎逐僞稱至外面購票，臨行語氏云，請代勞照佛小孩。約五分鐘後，女郎返回座位，亟懷抱小孩而去。後氏啓皮包　取捲烟消悶，發覺磚戒已不翼而飛，始誤已爲女郞所竊，於是急報新成分局請緝。</p>

<h3>西溪訪</h3>
<p>秋深了，在杭州的一部份同業有西溪之行，記者抽出半日閒，亦參加了這個短短的旅行。去西溪，須搭浙江省公路局的汽車，先到留下。留下是在宋高宗被逼南渡的時候，擬建帝宮於西溪之畔，後發現古臨安（即今之杭州）鳳凰山猶勝於此，宋帝乃謂左右：「西溪且留下！」因以得名。現在的留下，已是杭縣的一個鄉鎭，那裏產米，茶，蠶桑，柿子與蘆。</p>
<p>一畝田三石</p>
<p>我問過地方上的人，知道今年的收成都很好，一畝田可以收到三石榖，平常輾榖成米，要打一對折，今年顆粒又大，可打一六折，原來還租要榖子一石，近年因爲二五减租，只要還米三斗，一畝田做十一工，每工五升米，計共八斗半，　賺九斗五升，要比在年好些了。今年杭市遊客多，市內茶葉不够賣，留下的茶葉也隨着起色。柿子產量也很好，蠶桑不算錯，蘆草正是收穫的時節了。</p>
<p>雇舟子上西溪</p>
<p>由留下雇舟上西溪，這種舟楫與玄武湖或西子湖的遊艇，紹屬的腳划船絕不相同，它是一種底尖而又嬌小玲瓏的划平。稍一不愼，即有翻身之　，但在這團近二十里的溪流中，往來不斷的却儘是這稱船，而且五六十歲的老太太，與八九歲的小姑娘，她們都神態自若，悠閒瀟灑的划着一葉扁舟，來留下趕市集。</p>
<p>翻乾土播豆種</p>
<p>循者這溪流而去，兩岸遍植着桑枝柿樹，有幾個農胞又在踏車扇水，原來天氣已久晴，要用水來浸潤這乾燥的土地，然後能翻鬆來散播豆的種子，據舟子吿訴我：「今年的蔬菜與明年的大豆恐怕都要受到影響。」</p>
<p>秋雪　詞人</p>
<p>船再向前駛，溪水嫩綠得可愛，面前划來的舟楫，倒影在溪中，可以在綠波裏辨出這划船的姑娘底自　紅唇，一簇簇細竹，一叢叢蘆草，蘆花臨風飄盪，煞是好看。曲折盤旋，抵秋雪庵下，我們拾數級抵庵門，門雖設而常關，改由歷代詞人祠進內，詞人祠內，供有「兩浙詞人」，「兩浙宦游詞人」，「流寓詞人」，「　閣詞人」，「方外詞人一之位凡五。巡視庵內，亦不過平屋四五間，有樓一，登樓，見有「彈指樓」三字，憑　遙望，一片秋雪，現在眼底，微風吹動，蘆花飛舞半空，正像秋晴飛絮。</p>
<p>草貴價五萬</p>
<p>和尚爲我們吿：「倘在明月之下，風稍稍火一些，漫天朵朶蘆花，飄泊無定，眞是一片奇景！」</p>
<p>這十里蘆葦，都是藉風媒而生，蘆草可作蘆蓆，編識籃筐，或者利用蘆花織爲草鞋，冬天穿了溫暖如春。這種蘆草不必人工，每担約可售四萬至五萬。據有蔖草的人家，往往獲利不少。</p>
<p>另有交蘆庵，在蘆花深處。逍西溪的蘆花與溪畔的風景，遠在古唐時代即已馳名。可惜一般人只求急功近利，忽略了淸心養性的地方，所以今日西溪，顯得荒凉冷落了。</p>
<p>赴花　賞松竹</p>
<p>我們採擷數枝　草，歸舟留下，又搭車返到在塢。花塢也是以往騷人墨客來往之所，近代詩人徐志摩曾在此逗留很久。這裏有一小小山道，爲卵石砌成，循坡而上，松竹茂密，山嶺起伏，道左不時出現房舍，有幾幢還是新式的建築。竹林之旁，有屋名「有竹居」。過此，有小溪自山而下，名「留香溪」，可惜秋睛日久，不聞　琮之聲。同行黃行天，邵越兩兄，原曾訪×××臚法師，今天我們又即扉奉訪，無如久久沒有人答應，徘徊　旁。</p>
<p>老婦人述身世</p>
<p>後有路人過此始知毗鄰之×××舍也有蔭　的規模，始又叩問舍門，一老女傭啓扉迎入。見一老太太方持珠　佛，承吿：「隔壁法師去法華山了，就在這裏坐坐吧」！，承這位老太太招待我們，她向我們傾訴她的身世。</p>
<p>原來她姓×，她只有兩個女兒：大女兒嫁給民初煊赫一時的×××底四少爺。不幸長女妙齡夭亡，次女也嫁給了他。</p>
<p>女兒孝營茅蓬</p>
<p>女兒爲孝思所動，故營茅篷數橡，爲慈母養性之處。四少爺現在外面又有了太太，而且生男育女，她的小姐正孤度歲月。據說現在×家也衰敗了，在上海，連自己的房子也沒有了，十幾年來，這位少爺也沒有理會過她的女兒。現在，物價高，生活不易維持。這位老太太已經七十以外的人了。她又吿訴我們隔壁蔭　是上海×家的，現在這位×老太太許久沒有來了。×老先生也死了。她常然緬懐以往的風光。我們則警惕着飛箭般的時代！想不到在這神仙一般幽靜活適的環境裏，還有這樣一段片刻興敗盛衰的社會故事。是的，我們今天愛戀這自然的景物，決不是想隱居潛修，而是使自己淸醒過來，不要沾染着貪妄虛僞驕奢的俗氣！（特派員儲裕生）</p>

<h3>紅頭上紅蟲病　林秉衡活活犧牲何水泉被斬獲救</h3>
<p>〔木報台北廿四日航訊〕曾由本省科學家實地踏査過的我國東南方最前哨紅頭嶼（現名蘭嶼）上，不久前發生了一件很悲慘的故事，氣象局測候所長得了「紅蟲病」，高熱不退，神志瘋頤，特刀劈開了所內職員的腦袋，結果所長死了，職員總算運到台北來醫治好。</p>
<p>蘭嶼（若干宣傳爲「世外樂園」）住着位居全世界未開化民族第二位的土著阿眉族，也有着噬人的紅蟲與惡疫，當氣象局決定恢復這裏颱風預報上具有前哨價値的測候所時，該局測風氣球股長福建靑年林秉衡（廿七歲，父母早故）首先應允這件任務，願意到這人跡罕至的荒烏上去。五月卅一日，林所長率領屬員跟着科學調查團抵達該島。原有的測候所毀得只剩了一座門窗全毀的風力塔，林所長和負工便在這座塔裏忍受了朝夕風雨的襲　，埋頭整理，三個月內，他們得不到一點人間的溫暖，米沒有了，脫下了衣服向土著換些芋艿充飢，唾的是永遠不能乾燥的濕棉被。想修房子，拿不到錢，更買不到器材，結果他被紅虫噬着病倒了，電報像雪片飛來，想盡方法多不能獲得一隻最起碼的船去念救。九月十五日熱度劇增，他在焦灼，痛苦，昏迷交織的時候，竟將該所職員何水泉死命的斫了一刀，額，鼻，胸多被劈開，當被同所職員將刀奪下，但他自己已無法支持，至十六日淹然而逝，一個爲服膺於科學工作而犧牲一切的有爲靑年，就這樣默默倒地在這個蠻荒之島上。何水泉經過醫治，總算死裏逃生，但顏面上却留下了一條深深的凹痕，林秉衡的死，在這條凹痕上看得很淸楚，他是在一種如何絕望的意念下死去的。</p>
<p>蘭嶼也是個國防前哨，來往滬，菲，港，菲間的海船，常在這裏寄泊，他們會拿許多外國貨上岸討好原始的番族，慢慢地土著也就看不起中國人，中國官，因爲中國人拿衣服向他們換芋艿。就這一點和一個科學工作者的保障來說，我們不能忘掉它是中華民國版岡上的前哨地位，雖然要求交通，聯絡的呼聲是那樣微弱！（特派員江暮雲）</p>

<h3>籃球友誼賽　華聯勝美海軍　六十比五十七相差三分競爭劇烈戰局形勢緊張</h3>
<p>中美籃球友誼賽，華聯與美海軍托披卡隊，昨日下午七時會師於市體育館，觀衆約計二千人，托披卡船長亦親臨督戰，門票棋下二萬元券，售出八五三張，計一千七百另六萬，樓上一萬元券，四二〇張，計四百廿萬，兩共二千一百　六萬元，收入充作建作活動看台一部份經費。華聯李震中出塲僅三分鐘，右眼被撞，又吿出血，不得已即行離塲，殊爲遺憾。戰局頗見緊張，華聯上半時以三十六比廿四佔先，結果僅以六十比五十七勝三分。</p>
<p>美兵佔先</p>
<p>裁判劉荷生金伯陶，華聯以李震中，包松圓，吳成章，任相成，陳學　五將登塲，番兵則以梅亞，惠培，鮑塞，培漢，祁美尼臨陣，接觸後，祁美尼首中籃圈，梅亞繼之，擲罰俱中，祁美尼錦上添花，番兵以七比零前導，華聯暫停，李震中眼部舊創復發離塲，劉碼善入補。</p>
<p>華聯居上</p>
<p>惠培　美尼又吿活躍，華聯急起直追，吳成章籃下拖入，相成底角破監，學崇長射中的，福着揮入，以十比十四接近，番兵二度呼停，調整降容，仍未見效。阿弟老包福善相繼中的，華聯反以十六比十四超出二分，托披卡三度呼停。再戰至廿二比十九，華聯領前三分時，客軍又停戰易將，吳成章罰得，惠培探中，福着跟進，未幾成章連珠妙射，一氣呵得六分，上半時完舉，華聯以卅六比廿四領前。</p>
<p>最大距離</p>
<p>休息過後，易籃再戰，阿弟首中紅心，祖美尼回敬，老包隻手破籃，梅亞罰中，形成拉鋸。嗣番軍惠培梅亞相　　兇，而華聯亦緊扣不放，五十二比　九，托披卡仍在下風。番軍又以後備生力軍應戰，阿弟底角揮入，五十四比卅九，華聯遙領十五分，爲變方分數之距離。</p>
<p>三分取勝</p>
<p>戰未多時，番軍又雙陣形，稍見振作，華聯漸見鬆弛至五十三比五十六，華聯已僅勝三分時，學崇破籃，培漢五次犯規被黜，范德立入補，學崇梅開二度，祁美尼兩　兩中，番兵尙待背城借一，無奈時間已屆，鐘聲響處·華聯以六十比五十七戰勝托披卡，報復前仗一箭之仇。</p>

<h3>北大「工學院」　彬彬證以四十年歷史淵源得在文化城最後歸宿</h3>
<p>— 彬彬</p>
<p>舊都西直門裏端王府，一個首創的工業敎育機構，在此「文化城」　確有其獨特的歷史。無怪乎去夏之歸併北洋大學，今夏之改隸北京大學，都有些老敎授老校友堅持護校。然此校之改名改制改隸，四十年來，早已滄桑遍歷，而今之成爲最高學府之北大之工學院，可稱良好之歸宿。以純客觀的眼光着來，固未始非福也。</p>
<p>現在把此校之沿革，作一提要之評述：</p>
<p>「高等實業學堂」，是最早的校名·一九零三年，前淸商部（一九零五年改稱農工商部）因振興實業，需要造就人才，由尙書（部長）載振創辦，其贊助籌畫者爲太倉人唐文治，（進士出身，曾任農工商部特郞，淸末爲江南高等實業學堂監督。前幾年聽說此人尙在，年將九旬矣），雖係「部立」，而一切依照學務大臣張百熙所定之實業學堂之章程，其開辦費則張氏由「大學堂」，（即北大之前身）經費中撥付二萬兩，因其時北大之工科尙未開辦，故有餘款移用。此校在經濟上，在基礎上，皆與「北大」有歷史淵源，誠非一朝一夕之故。校址初在祖家街，後移端王府，先辦補習班（即今名詞所謂先修班）二年，於一九零七年開辦本科，至一九一一年辛亥革命，自初創計算，此一階段之校齡爲八年。</p>
<p>民國初，各「學堂」一律改稱「學校」，此一高等實業學堂」則改稱一工業專門學校」，隸於敎育部，由「部立」而「國立」，系統既明，地位亦固。「五四」以後，新文化運動潮流帶起了「學府」名位的狂熱，私立大學之多既如雨後春筍。國立各專門如師範，交通等，亦紛紛呼籲「改大」「升大」，故此校亦不甘落伍，民國十三年經幾度請願後，敎育部批准升爲「國立北京工業大學」，如是者四年，而遇到張作霖。</p>
<p>首次隸屬北大</p>
<p>張作霖於舊都自稱「大元帥」，建立「軍政府」，其敎育部將北京大學之「北京」改爲「京師」，並將各院系改爲「科」，皆從淸末之「京師大學堂」之舊式，而將其他各大學併入，於是此四齡之工業學府，又由大學而降爲大學之一科，名曰「京師大學工科」·雖然那是張作霖的把戲，而所謂「京大」實是「北大」的變名，則可認爲現在隸屬「北大」之前奏曲，是爲第一次。</p>
<p>張作霖自拉自唱的「軍政府」命運很短，一年光景被革命軍驅逐出關，舊都統一於國府之下，氣象一新，學制亦煥然改觀，有大學區之創格，有「北平大學」以統轄各校，以此工校爲「北平大學第一工學院」，而以北洋大學爲「第二工學院」。北洋雖是大學，且資格更老，但因校址在天津，當然列於第二，「老大哥」倒做了「小兄弟」，二十年前異地殊門，風馬牛不相及之兩校，忽然成「連枝並蒂」，亦是運會使然，出乎想像以外。次年大學區制度，遭遇困難，北平大學「統一羣雄」的辦法，亦難以服衆。資老望重的北京大學首先獨樹一幟。北洋亦恢復大學，既無所謂「第二工學院」，則「第一」兩字亦無所用，故爲「北平大學工學院」，自十八年至二十六年「七七」事變，計歷時八年。（未完）</p>
<h3>華聯對托披卡　戰局過程的解剖</h3>
<p>〔本報特稿〕華聯昨夕克服托披卡隊，過程緊懈不一，華隊會以五寸四比三十九領前十五分之多，終局僅贏三分，局面的演變，暴露了雙方的優弱點。</p>
<p>大李上塲幾分鐘，便因傷創復發退休。老包，阿弟，學崇，福善，相成合作無間，初時保持均勢。阿弟吳成重刧射出色，華聯便吿超前，曾有一個長時期，保持五球左右的優勝。</p>
<p>美軍長人車輪大戰</p>
<p>美軍頻頻調人，表演車輪戰，其實此較可取的有四個人材：中鋒梅亞，近籃投擲有把握，而且身高六尺五寸，依然不稍减却　跑活蹦的速率。惠勃和黑人鮑塞得力於穩健，祁美尼的運球衝射，也見身手不凡。但以塲地未熟，似未能完全發揮。</p>
<p>托披卡隊與華聯相形之下，顯得傳　技巧較　，不遇　人鮑塞和長人梅亞之間，有一記絕妙純熟的傳遞，黑人頭腦冷靜，善於利用機會，梅亞藉了身材便宜，所以昨夕常見兩人合作取分的鏡頭。</p>
<p>華聯幾乎反勝爲敗</p>
<p>華缺少大李，活動能大依舊，但失却鎭定。在極度的優勢下，被美軍一氣奪取十分之多，原因在任相成濫施遠射，毫無所獲，老包在上半場拼完氣力，下半時祇好偸懶，再加上心理上的因紮，幾乎造成反勝爲敗的局面。相成在目前。是華聯射籃最弱的一個，祇能當作傳球的緩衝和停逗點，昨晚他有機會而射不中，應射而不敢射。華聯將來如欲和「大公」·一靑白」。等隊爭奪錦標，上面的弱點，是短期間內應該努力改進的。（昌年）</p>

<h3>明年世界運動會　將採用電力計時　技術問題借住科學</h3>
<p>〔英國新聞處倫敦　八日電〕定於明年在倫敦舉行之第十四屆世界運動大會中，有許多技術問題，刻正由英國國立物理硏究所硏究員襄助處理。電力計時，徑賽終點攝影，準確度量器械，複綫電話與電報，公路上競賽之無綫電管制，及裁判員所用信號機等，均一一見諸計劃。在世運會比賽中裁判員求助於照片之事，雖不屢見，若干年前亦嘗有之。一九四八年大會籌備委員會，正在考慮於溫勃萊帝國運動場跑道離地面六十呎處，裝置時別鏡箱，以便攝取終點照片。各項徑賽，可能用電力計時，發令者所用手槍，通一電路，扳機動時，終點站所置時計，即開始走動。此種計時系統，用於脚路車，躍馬，與划船比賽者，又各各不同。在脚踏車比賽中，優勝者將在終綫經過一置於路面之橫條，在躍馬比賽中，頭馬衝斷一統，在划船比賽中則時計由光電射錢運轉。</p>

<h3>紡調袁主委召開談話會　民營廠提四點意見　雙方對棉紗聯配試行辦法已接近</h3>
<p>（本報訊）紡綢會主委袁良，於昨日下午三時，召集民營紗廠若干首腦，在該會會談，到王啓字，唐星海·郭棣活·劉靖基·劉丕基·榮一心等，至六時許始吿散會。會後袁主委及各民營紗廠代表，咸表雙方對棉紗聯合配銷試行辦法之意見，已極按近。其原則已無問題，惟施行技術間題，仍待積極謀取合理解決。</p>
<p>六區棉紡公會各首腦，會於昨日中午集會，對聯配試行辦法，曾加研究，決定向紡調會貢獻意見四點：　所有聯配棉紗，應包括代紡棉紗在內，以充實配紗數額。　棉紗議價，應速定合理計算公式，以顧全生產成本爲原則。　聯配之實施，應以全國性及中外各紗廠一律待遇爲準。　原料次炎金週轉兩問題，務必有確實辦法。以上四點，各民營代表，曾於紡調會會談席上，再當提出商討，結果變方意見，業吿接近。</p>
<p>袁主委昨於會後接兌記者，對民營廠所提四點意見，表示第一點頗屬公道。第二點議價問題，將來可能改按實物折算。第三點認爲聯配初衷，本屬全國性，不過先在滬區試辦而已，將來視情形，逐步推廣及於全國。第四點之原料，爲根本問題，必須解決，資金當亦設法使之融通。總之，民營廠所提意見，將代爲轉陳中樞常局洽商解決云。</p>
<p>又訊：紡調會袁主委，昨奉行政院張院畏電召，已定於今晨飛京。聞對各民營廠所提聯配意見四點，亦將提出向當局洽商，俾來合理解決辦法。</p>

<p>昨日開售棉紗八種</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕近日棉紗黑市波動，聞係因原棉成本增加，市塲籌碼枯竭所致。紡調會爲調節供需，抑制黑市起見，除已決定對各紗廠分配原棉，業誌昨報外，頃復徇各紗布廠商之請求，自昨日起，在棉紗市塲開售棉紗。配售對象，以原在紡建公司登記合格之廠商爲限，配售棉紗商標，達八種之多。配售數量及價格，由各廠商自行塡報。</p>
<p>統計結果，自願依照三千萬元至三千一百萬元之價格申請購買者，共計僅有廿支紗一千四百餘件，距離紡調會準備於是日配售之棉紗數量尙遠，因此一般人心虛軟，棉紗黑市，廿支金城驟落二百萬元左右。本日行情，可望繳讀下降。</p>
<p>廿支議價又見提高</p>
<p>至紡建公司掛牌配給各複製業之棉紗，昨日仍照舊依照議價開售，廿支紗議價昨亦同時調整爲二千八百十一萬元。聞當局對於今後複　業棉紗之供應及棉紗市塲之維持，將運用靈活技巧，採取機動方式，雙管齊下，務期打擊黑市，使投機國積者，自食其果云。　又訊：紡調會爲核配國行所撥出之原棉三萬包，頃特公吿如次：査本會現擬將原棉一批，陝續分配各紗廠代紡棉紗。凡過去會向本會承辦代紡著有信用且存棉確屬缺乏之各紗廠，可自即日起，前來本會洽辦申請手續，特此公吿。</p>
<h3>新買心思渙散華股市況疲軟</h3>

<h3>長堤春柳</h3>
<p>— 洪爲法</p>
<p>揚州續夢之二十六</p>
<p>楊柳和招州像頗有關係，這大約是因過去的隋堤之故。揚州府志上說：『隋開刋溝入江，旁築御河，樹以揚柳，今謂之隋堤。」煬帝開河記上說：『詔民間有柳一株，賞一　百姓競獻之。又令親種，帝自種一株，羣臣次第種，方及百姓，時有謠言日：天子先栽，然後百姓栽。栽畢，帝御筆寫賜埀楊柳姓楊曰楊柳也。」便因這隋堤多柳，而煬帝又死在揚州，於是談到揚州，也就談到隋堤和楊柳。到了王漁洋的冶春詞所謂『北郭淸谿一帶流，紅橋風景眼中秋，綠楊城郭是揚州」盛傳後，綠楊城郭竟變成揚州的異名，而楊柳也像是揚州特有的點綴了。</p>
<p>在昔揚州的楊柳，無疑是很多的，而北郊瘦西湖的長堤上則爲尤多，因此揚州八景中便有所謂「長堤春柳。」這長堤春柳，據畫舫錄上說：『在虹橋西岸，爲吳氏別　大門，與冶春詩社相對。』又說：「揚州宜楊，在堤上者更大。冬月插之，至春即活，三四年即生二三丈。髡其枝，中空，雨餘多產菌如碗，合抱成園，痴肥臃腫，不加修飾，或五步一株，十步雙樹，三三兩兩，跤立園中·構廳事額曰濃陰草堂，聯云：秋水纔添四五尺，（杜甫）綠陰相間兩三家。（司空圖）』此外畫舫錄中寫『西園曲水』時，更說及西園中的「觴詠樓西南多柳，構廓穿樹，長條短線，埀檐覆脊，春燕秋鴉，夕陽疏雨，無所不宜。中有拂柳亭，聯云：曲徑通幽處，（高適）埀楊拂細彼。（溫庭筠）北郊楊柳，至此曲盡其態矣。』可見揚州北郊的楊柳很是著稱，而長堤春郊則又是北郊的楊柳之代表作。</p>
<p>關於長堤春柳，畫舫錄中更說到過去爲黃氏爲蒲所築，幷另有汪氏元麟以畫長堤春柳岡得名。此圖不知今日是否尙在人間，而黃氏當時修築長堤春柳的情形如何，也不可復知。以現况說，長堤總算還存在着，長堤上一座已經很殘破的亭子裏，還懸掛着陳氏重慶所寫的『長堤春柳」橫額，可是春柳却僅剩三五零星了。在亭子裘更有陳氏所撰「修復長堤春柳記」的石刻，其中說到「故湖上八景有長堤春柳，其地起虹橋爲堤，西屬之司徒廟，元崔伯亭花園直堤之半，王盧冶春修禊，先後咸在於此，是爲洪氏倚虹園，今徐園則其地也。丙辰之歲，楊君炳炎興治徐國，既　其事，復出私財，自園至虹橋因故堤增高益廣，夾植桃柳，蔭蔚成　，凡用銀元若千枚，修堤一里，植樹五百餘株，而後舊跡所存，圖經所載，可考而見。」於此可知最近一次修復長堤春柳景色的時期，是在民國五年，主其事者是楊氏炳炎。楊氏名燿。關於此事，在江都縣新志上亦有記載：「徐寳山歿後，邦人士於湖上建園，祀寳山其中。初，　其役者吳策，策卒，燿繼之。値盛署往來列日中。時燿年近七十，不憚勞苦。逾年聞成，復於紅橋西沿堤植柳數百株，以達於國，中建一亭，爲遊人休息之所。今所植之樹，皆扶疏埀蔭，春夏問自紅橋以東遙望之，儼若圖畫，而惜乎燿之不及見也。」新志上祗說『植柳」，而修復長堤春柳記上却說「夾植桃柳」，以筆者昔時所見，確是一株楊一株桃。祗不過短短三十年，而由楊氏修復的長堤春柳，又已摧毀，春柳還有三五零星，桃樹便連一株也不可復見，剩了孤露着的一條所謂一里長的「長堤」，遊人經過其上，既感崎嶇碍步，又苦塵沙撲面，那能再能如新志所說「春夏間自紅　以東遙望之，嚴若圖賓呢」！</p>
<p>不過撫今思昔，筆者於十數年前却還能於春秋佳日在這長堤春柳間，時時作圖畫中人。三五知交，踏過紅橋，緩緩的由長堤向徐園走去。兩旁錫柳依依，千條萬縷，戲弄着遊人的衣袖，一時遊人衣袖上也像點染上不少的綠意。兼以春日夭桃呈艷，夏秋嗚蟬競唱，更使人感到塵氛悉蠲，俗慮盡滌，步調在不自知間益復緩慢了許多，藉以細細咀嚼其中的詩情畫意。有時又會親持釣竿，閑坐在淮蔭下埀釣着，此時得魚與否，似乎並非十分關心之事，却儘是鑒賞着水中柳影的婆娑，以及落花的務漾。除了步行，又常扁舟往來於長堤。總是要船犬貼岸行駛，好隨手章折着柳條，並非以此賺別，却想帶了回去，藉誌湖上的遊跡。可是此等情景，在筆者都已成爲舊夢，長堤早經非復舊觀，遊船似乎也不勝滄桑之感，再不沿着長堤道一邊行駛了。不知何時更有好事如楊氏炳炎再來修復一次長堤春柳，筆者惟有懐着無限企盼的心情而已！</p>
<h3>施女行</h3>
<p>— 鄭午昌</p>
<p>月之十三日，爲施劍翹女士刺孫傳芳報殺父仇之紀念日。集顧紗籠，賦此贈之</p>
<p>生我者死我不死，不死有待仇未雉。手指黃河腰藏匕，不馘某首猶如水。大謀不忍兒戲耳，繞柱徒然悲壯士，呑恨背地蹤且俟，隙無司逞暗切齒。數年一日志不馳，赫然相値近在咫；雙眸盡裂髮上指，奮臂不暇左右視，巨聲若雷出袖裏，血濺蒲國我佛喜。仇已雉矣生何企，自首求死官不理。古來孝義幾人比，天下爭傳奇女子。施家美，有如比，殺人之父魄應褫；爲人之子誰不恥！</p>
<h3>魚樂園（油畫）</h3>
<p>— 胡亞光</p>
<h3>郁達夫的詩詞</h3>
<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>郁達夫不在人問的噩耗，兩年來，從各方面的事實報吿，是可以確信而沒有什麼疑義的了。以個文人的結局是以悲劇收場的同然是無限的悽涼悲感，同時也使後人們每當想念到他便有不可名狀的感悼，也就是這一點吧。</p>
<p>達夫的生年，從舊曆說來，是丙申年，庚子日，甲午日，甲子時。這是光緒的二十二年十一月初三。公曆一八九六年，即民國前十五年。他是在民國卅四年，日本投降後失蹤（被害）的，在世只有四十九歲。一代文人，給大時代的犧牲，借用一句詞來說，眞是「可哀惟有人間世」了。</p>
<p>他中年以後，餘事做的舊體詩詞，造詣很深，字裏行間，雖然充滿着憂　的情調，却有他的面目，和一般　老嗟貧的不同。多，其中也有還沒有披露的。今拉雜地摘錄一些，藉供大家的欣賞。</p>
<p>達夫移居在杭州的時候，很遊記和雜文較多，創作小說較少，西遊詩紀中，如：</p>
<p>臨安道上野景：「泥壁茅篷四五家，山茶初茁兩三芽；天晴男女忙農去，閒殺門前一樹花。」</p>
<p>玲瓏山寺琴操墓前翻閱臨安縣志不見琴操事蹟但云墓在寺東：「山既玲瓏水亦淸，東坡曾此訪雲英（見碑文）。如何十卷臨安志，不記琴操一段情！」</p>
<p>出昱嶺關過三陽坑後車道曲折風景絕佳：「盤旋曲徑幾多灣，歷盡千山與萬山。外此更無三宿變，西來又過一重關。地傳洙泗溪爭出，俗近江淮語略蠻。只恨征車留不得，讓他桃李語春閒。」</p>
<p>這些都是杭微公路的風景，在公路初通時，我曾沿路的遊覽。達夫所描寫的，眞是詩中有畫，尤其是昱嶺關附近的廻旋灣道，歷歷如繪。</p>
<p>民廿三年三月九日過岳不墓下改舊作：「憑眺湖山日又矄，回車來拜大王墳。蟲沙早已喪三鎮，猿鶴初堪張一軍－河朔奇勳歸魏絳，江南刺議薄劉　。可憐五百男兒血，空化田橫島上雲！」</p>
<p>這是一八後的三年，日　咄咄遍我，華北風雲日急，當時中央的對策，還沒有公開的決定。達夫此詩，是有無限的慨歎。他還有「過岳墳感時事」詩，中有：「北地小兒耽逸樂，有朝天子愛風流。權臣自欲成和議，金　何當要汴州！」與贈閩報同人的：」閩中風雅賴扶持，氣節應爲弱者師；萬一國亡家破後，對花！淚豈成詩！」愛國心志，溢於言表。</p>
<p>他四十歲生日的前幾天，有和趙龍文詩兩首：「卜築東門事偶然，種瓜敢詠應龍篇？但求飯飽牛衣暖，茍活人間再十年。」「昨日東周今日秦，池魚那復辨庚卒？門前幾點冬靑樹，便算桃源洞裏春。」</p>
<p>這司以說是他四十的言志詩，事眞凑巧，到他失蹤離開世界剛剛是十年，「苟活人間再十年，」竟成了誠語！</p>
<p>他有金縷曲詞，是仿顧梁汾寄吳季子詞而作的，懐音若調，憂憤悔恨，讀的當能領會他那時的心境，詞云：「兄等平安否，記離時，都門擊筑，漢皋賭酒，別後光陰駒過隙，又是一年將盡，怕說與近來病瘦。我是無能甘命薄，最傷心，母老妻兒幼。身後事，賴良友。　半身積貯風雙袖。悔當初千金買笑，量珠論斗。往日牢騷今懶發，發了還愁無醜。且莫問文章可有！即使續成秋柳稿，語荒唐，要被萬人咒。言不盡，弟頓首。」</p>
<p>從「詩言志」的一句話說來，這些詩詞，都可以說充分表露達夫的心境，我們今日讀了，還是有無限的同情。</p>
<h3>謁師聆訓記</h3>
<p>— 陸松蔭</p>
<p>民國州六年寸一月九日，偕交大級友朱友能，沈志開，曹伯權，陸潤瑜，王振羣，周季舫，濮九峰，同謁唐師蔚芝先生於靜安寺路之滬寓。蓋自學業離校，以迄於今，已卅年矣。回憶廿六年暮春，同級諸君子曾作宜興無錫之遊，憑弔吳越之遺跡，登茹經之堂，恍若重立程門之雪，尤令人依依不忍遽去。是晚公宴吾師於邸第，縱談古今得失，師朗吟杜工部秋興詩，於「匡衡抗疏功名簿，劉向傳經心事違」二句，音調激越，如出金石，同學咸深感奮，及夜蘭歸寓，猶樂不可支，春風沂水不是過也。乃不及數月，而日寇肆虐，封豕長蛇，薦食上國，淞滬淪陷，京邑失守，同學旣多流離淪陷，我師亦復播越湘桂，其暫留於此者，類皆局促如轅下駒，欲圖茍全性命於亂世，尙不可得，矧復能師生一室，以重叙舊日之業哉？天　其衷，強敵聽命，同學散而復聚，最近舞於京滬各地者幾達二十人，世運雖否而未泰，河山幸缺而復完，於是謀所以紀念之道，則僉曰，蒙難以正，箕子之明夷也；發聲震聵，尼山之本鐸也；我等處身憂患之境，出入貨利之塲，私欲日張，天理漸泯，茍非就正於有道，奚能自全於叔世！因決踵夫子之門請益，而由沈君志開先往請期。師聞之，不以爲不可敎，色然喜，既示以晋見之日，復爲預編講義，至則賜之坐，而加以詮釋焉。師之言日：方今最要者，氣節二字而已矣！近曾撰聯云「人生惟有廉節重，世界須憑氣骨撐」，諸君其深體斯意，苟隨波逐流，如羽毛之熔於洪爐，非我徒也。夫人必矢志廉潔，俾良知不昧，而後能有所展布。故居今之世，提倡陽明之學以實行經訓，實爲當務之急。至今人競言建設，然物有本末，事有終始，舍本逐末，事必無成。吾輩須從根本着想，方可言建設；不然方寸之間，見利忘義，本心已昏昧，豈能辦天下之大事，蘇子有言，辦天下之大事者，立天下之大節者也。願二三子共勉之。自始至終，訓誨懃懃，逾一時始畢。嗣合攝一影，以留紀念，始稱謝而別。回憶初列緙帳時，師方年逾强仕，同學均在弱冠，誠歲月之幾何，而師已籌登耄善，同學輩亦兩鬢將絲，垂垂老矣。學業無成，修名不立，撫今追昔，能無感既系之乎！雖然五百年必有名世出，自陽明先生以來，逾五百年矣，繼之而起者，非吾師而誰？詩曰，「愷悌君子受福不回」：又曰」俾爾職而昌，俾爾發而康」。追而記之，以爲吾師壽，爲同學勉，且以自勵焉！</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 華勁風</p>
<p>鶴見和萍子，在天津就分了手。然而鶴見剛抵東京頭一個電話，就是萍子打來的。鶴見問她：「怎麼回來得這麼快？」萍子却沒有答覆，在電話裏所聽到的，却是一連串銀鈴般的笑聲；「格格格」。</p>
<p>「大哥，您的御宿處，已經有人替您佈置好了；就在上野公園過去不遠，那個『新絲大厦』最高一層－第七層－，窗外的風景，美麗得很；極能引起您的詩興……大哥，您要是有了好詩句，千萬要記下來；您知道，有人等着要看哩。……可是工作方而，您也得早早計劃一下，您那些同志們今晚也許要來請見咧……再見吧，再見罷！……」</p>
<p>「喂，我因爲什麼要住在那個什麽大厦裏？」鶴見的聲書，顯然十二分的粗獷。可是萍子沒有答　，一事靑　的笑聲之後，「喳」地一聲，對方的電話已經掛斷了。</p>
<p>「這個女傢伙，眞是一個「魔之謎」！簡直呌人又恨又憎，然又把她無可如何！」鶴見在叙談之中，插入這麽一句。</p>
<p>「這呌作『棺材底　木屐脚』…」我忍不住要笑。</p>
<p>「什麽『脚』？…」鶴見發生了語言上的興趣。</p>
<p>「木展脚。」</p>
<p>「怎麽解說？」</p>
<p>「寃魄不散哪！」我又幹着敎授鶴見國語的職務了。</p>
<p>「　不懂，」鶴見極着頭皮，仰起頭來，斜着眼睛注視天花板；「…哦，明白了！」他笑了起來：「我記得關外不是道麼說法…好像是　　　　　　，　……，　火炕？」…那是說，有鬼找住了，不是嗎？怎麽是『鬭」呢？」</p>
<p>「恐怕是『棺材板裝火炕』吧，反正兩個說法，意思是一樣的。這個『關』，不是戰鬥的意思，是「鬭筍頭」的　，裝上去的意思。這是長江一帶說法；寃魄就是「鬼」的一種，不過比較普通鬼來得兇狠，找住了「寃家」永不撒手；就像萍子小姐現在對您的情形！」</p>
<p>「哼，寃魄不散；可是我並沒寃過她，也不欠她什麼咧。」鶴見有些發恨了。</p>
<p>鶴見接到萍子電話的地點，正是「軍友招待處」。名義上是招待，實際是看管；沒有上頭的命令，沒有把公事交代淸楚，絕對不能自由。</p>

<p>按趙翼廿四史剳記載：「洪武十八年，詔盡逮天下間官吏之爲民害者赴京師築城。帝初即位，懲元政弛縱，用法太嚴，奉行者重足而立，官吏有罪笞以上悉謫鳳陽屯田，至萬餘人。又按草木子記明祖　於吏治，几守令貪酷者許民赴京師陳訴，　至六十兩以上者　首示衆，仍剝皮實草。府州縣衙之左特立一廟，以祀土地爲剝皮之塲，名曰皮塲廟，官府公座勞各懸一剝皮實草之袋，使之觸目警心！法令森嚴，百職　舉。祖剴所謂革前元姑息之政，治舊俗汚染之徒也。</p>
<p>明意元政弛縱，遂用嚴刑峻法，官吏觸目警心！用能百職　舉。食酷之吏梟首示衆以後，仍要剝皮實草，不免使人感到舊時代的專制淫戚，過於殘酷，太不人道；然而於此却可看出明祖對貪汚之深惡痛絕，認爲死有餘事。官吏之爲民害者盡逮赴京師裏城，官吏有罪笞以上悉謫鳳陽屯田，不獨一反古時「刑不上大夫」之例，更可看出明祖澄淸吏治之決心與不姑息也。</p>

<h3>戰時信鴿</h3>
<p>— 輪</p>
<p>信鴿是最古軍事通訊法的一種，但在這科學這麽昌明的時代，牠仍然佔着頗高的位置。這些靜默的傳訊者，已在二次大戰多次戰役中，建立了很大的功勞。</p>
<p>有一次緬甸暹羅邊界盟軍一支隊被日軍包圍，就被一隻名呌　羅皇后的靑嘴鴿帶了情報出發，飛越過許多高山，歷程三二〇哩，終而保全了一千個生命。</p>
<p>又有一鴿名Gyse，亦曾在義大利境保全了盟軍一千名兵士的生命，這隻鴿到後來曾受倫敦市長所贈的狄克金獎章，非英國種的禽獸獲得此種榮譽者，牠是第一次。</p>
<p>又有美國陸軍中一隻雄鴿名Bolenie　Haliiz的一條腿上，是在日軍排砲砲火中放出，牠因身中鋼碎片，曾跌落在荆棘地上，這封情報二十分鐘本可到達，却逾時未到，但五小時以後，這隻體綫流血的忠鴿，終於飛達目的地，而腿上的情報，完整無換，</p>
<p>在法屬摩洛哥一隻靑嘴鴿名「阿斯托夫人」的，曾飛行九十哩，送到關於戰術重要的情報；牠在途巾雙脚會被擎中兩次，一翼也被彈洞穿，當達到了任務，已是精疲力竭了</p>
<p>鴿報傳訊，不但受軍隊人員的信任，而戰地訪員遇到缺乏其他通訊方法時，也利用此禽。</p>
<p>陸軍中的鴿子，正和陸軍中的文員一般；曾經過跟和平時大不相同的改變。牠的「家」換了地方，牠的習慣也會改變。牠的職務新而且奇，牠必須受特殊的敎練而合於一種特殊的工作，一切端賴牠所屬的隊伍支配。</p>
<p>當信鴿初習服務時，或隨人乘吉普車出發，或置在軍艦或飛機中，或由人携在背上，或放在軍用犬的肩上，或奉秘密使命飛出，那秘密迄今仍未便宣露。</p>
<p>戰爭中用鴿傳訊，乃始於公元前四十三年，那年羅馬省長白魯吐斯在慕蒂那被馬克安吐尼包園，羅馬政府政府官希爾透率領大軍前往解救，便以鴿携帶悄報傳達白魯吐斯。</p>
<p>信鴿作軍用，乃使此禽受國際的注意。德國是首建軍用鴿房的國家。</p>
<h3>「東京玫瑰」與「軸心莎莉」</h3>
<p>— 苞卿</p>
<p>尙逍遙法外居在橫濱的「東京玫瑰」，近用其葡萄牙丈夫家族之名，向美國中請護照赴美，國務院則已將申請書交付司法部審核。但是，美國軍人協會則要求國務院速行審訊其罪，不使其進入美國，永久居住。</p>
<p>在太平洋戰區作戰過的美隊軍人，是不會忘記這個從敵的播音小姐的。「東京玫瑰」在播音中自稱是美國洛杉磯人，名呌黛維絲。圓臉大眼，身長五尺二寸。隨其丈夫去日。在同盟社做過電話小姐，戰起後應考日軍對美廣播員而被錄取。在每晚八時至九時，用美語播昔，或說故事，或唱歌曲，或談些戰爭的事，爲日軍宣傳。雖然美軍被禁止收聽其播音，但她的甜言蜜語笑聲歌靑，却會使一些美軍沈醉，如聞祖國愛人說話。戰後被美國記者發現其踪跡後不久，就被逮捕了，現又被釋出。</p>
<p>而在德國，歐陸盟軍亦從那裏來的播音聲中，聽到了美國女郞的說話，好似「東京攻瑰」的姊妹花。這女郞自稱「軸心莎莉」，久居在美因州波得　城，眞名爲密爾德萊·祁關士。戰時在柏林廣播電台，爲納粹極力宣傳，要求盟軍士兵離開其軍隊，來歸向「光榮的祖國」懷抱中。自然，她的甜音是不如「東方玫瑰」那樣有味和出名。她於一九三四年進入德國的。戰後被扣，不知已釋出否。</p>
<p>在戰爭一部門之播昔戰中，利用敵籍女郞，以其鄉音，放播嬌柔的甜言蜜語，其惑亂敵人的軍心，是多少能收到一些心理上的功效的。</p>
<h3>懼與希特勒同名</h3>
<p>— 柴扉</p>
<p>「希特勒」在奧國是十分普遍的名字，其普遍的程度可與英國的史密斯。法國的裘郞，中國的阿毛阿狗媲美。在納粹稱霸歐洲的時候，與希特勒同名者處處願黨佔點小便宜，但如今仍冠「希特勒」大名，試有不勝負担之苦。在維也納現在就有一千五百個人要求把象徵獨裁的雅號加以更改。市政當局接受申請的時候照例要口試一番，供詞巾只要說明從前沒有當過國社黨員，那來這個申請就可以立刻批准。最近有位名法郞茲希特勒夫人的寡婦申請改名時，登記的官員，見了卡片紙說：</p>
<p>「太太，從今以後，你就改名爲繆勒夫人了，請你簽字吧。</p>
<p>靑年的太太簽了字，拿到身份證，隨即很自然地行了個希特勒式的敬禮，喊道：</p>
<p>「繆勒萬歲！」</p>
<p>官員嚇得目瞪口呆，以爲她以前確當過國社黨負似的。</p>
<h3>我愛王荊公</h3>
<p>— 一峰</p>
<p>「獨來獨往」，是一種卓高的人生態度。這種態度，絕不是肓目的或狹窄的偘急之見，而是一種對眞理負責的不茍精神。也一唯有具有獨來獨往的性格的人，就是一個眞心的戰士，一個完人。（雖然往往也是失敗的英雄。）他們處亂世，臨危境，絕不會隨波逐流，見利忘義；相反的可以見其高風亮節，太義凜然。古謂「狂捐之士」庶幾近之。</p>
<p>在歷史上，這種獨來獨往的人物，本應是一種可愛可敬的典型人物。但我們的歷史家大多具有一副以成敗論英雄的頭腦，因此對於這種獨自來往的失敗英雄，不是抹煞，便是故抑，以致殊不多傳或曲直不分。我個人認爲歷史上獨來獨往的人物，宋代的大政治家王安石應是最値得崇敬的一個。雖然晉朝的陶淵明，最爲人所稱譽，但他僅能做到退只獨善其身，並無有進而兼善天下的大志，和積極入世的思想。王荆公却不然，他有遠見，有抱負，絕對的對眞理負責，絲毫不有。他爲了舒抱負，施行新政，欲起宋家於積弱，絕不顧慮重臣及一般士大夫如富弼，韓琦，司馬光之流的反對。而且他更知道非做宰輔重臣，不足以實現主張，听以當仁宗朝即上萬言書，抒述其救國的大志，而仁宗幾度處判官，修起居注等不甚重要的官做，他都拒不奉召，即使　册吏拜而求之，他也一樣的不賣賬。直到神宗起用他爲江寗府，繼而授翰林學士，可以遂行其主張時，他寗可野居而不做官，這種精神，是何等可愛！雖然結果因爲用人不當，而至新政失敗了，還落得個「　相公」的罪名，但是檢討這失敗的責任，反對派的元老重臣們却要負大部的責任的。假使當時的元老重臣，能與他合作或至少不到處阻碍他新政的推行，那麼宋代南渡之禍，也許可以免除的。</p>
<p>荆公在少時，詠石榴花即有名句云：「濃綠花枝紅一點，動人春色不宜多。」可徵其風味不薄，及其狂狷精神的蘊蓄。及新政推行，多方遭受壓制的時候，他不僅不畏縮不前，而且以瑞雪自况云；「勢大直疑埋地盡，功成才見放春回；村農不識仁民意，只望靑天萬里開。」這又是何等胸襟！令反對者望而却步。及其新政失敗而下野，他也許爲其心血結晶的新政失敗而痛心，但絕不爲基本身得失而沮喪。他以「靑山捫風坐，黃鳥挾書眠」的怡然心情自處，亦可見其心地坦白，了無　俗。這與當前一般不甘寂寞的失意政客，　　攢營的作風，相去何啻天壤！</p>
<h3>鑒賞</h3>
<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>鑒賞是辨別質的高但，非品論人的貴賤，這是定例。然非玄鑒精通之人，鮮有不滯於耳目者，所謂世有伯樂，然後有千里馬是也。但以耳代目，自古已然，非由今始，茲舉數例，以資笑談。</p>
<p>梁張率，少穎異，好爲詩，年十六，已積二千餘首，有虞訥者，見而詆之　　乃一旦焚毀，更爲詩以示訥，託云沈約，訥讀之搖頭飛沫，句句嗟稱，率乃徐曰：「此亦余作也。」訥大慚。唐書法名家（或云大家）孫過庭，當以其得意之作，謁當代公卿，公卿不知其名，無不輕加詆誚，孫乃假之以總標，題之以古目，則賢愚改離，繼聲競賞矣。質以人重，大率如此：，鑒賞云乎哉！然眞能鑒賞者，古亦不乏其人，如薛燭之識靑萍，卞和之別結綠，蔡邕不鑒賞，孫陽不妄顧，此則尤佼校者，至如唐之顧况，鑒賞白居易之詩，尤屬難得：按白居易曾以所業謁顧公，公熱視其名曰：「京師米貴，居大不易。」及觀其作曰：「道得箇中語，居亦何難，前言戲之耳！」因爲延譽，名遂大振。余之所謂難得者，以顧公前倨後恭，眞能重質不重人也。世之紛紜擾攘，皆由於不目知其錯，然有明知其錯而不自改，偘更違心網續其錯者，比比皆是。若顧公者，可以風矣。</p>
<p>美國小姐</p>
<h3>美國小姐的自我宣傳</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>「三代以下無有不好名者」，這話可說是中外古今，一律通用。而美國小姐風頭之健冠於儕輩。「好名」並不是壊事，貴能「好名不妄」，美國小姐差不多够得上說「好名不妄」。舉一個例來說，上海有一位著名舞星在百樂門進塲，頭一天做了兩萬萬元，實際打了一個三折，祗做了六千萬元，而這六千萬元還不是實收的數字，這有些近乎「好名而妄」了。美國人最恨欺騙，所以祇管「好名」而確能做到「不妄」的程度。她們有各種的自我宣傳方法，尤其善於借重外力，但並不强造局面，她們的多才多藝，使她們能參加及深入各種團體及塲合而出足風頭，差不多可以說多數美國小姐擅長詩文，音樂，油畫，游泳，溜冰，騎術，跳舞，球類運動，撲克，飲酒，她們可以參加一切外交宴會或社交派對，而且一定有恰合身份的演出。</p>
<p>某一位小姐和外國的使節或軍人跳了一隻舞，第二天報上登出照片，那位小姐也被連帶的摔了一陣。我到舊金山大學找瑪莎，她伴同我參觀該校，並介紹了很多女生，第二天黨地報紙學校風光欄中登出消息說是舊金山大學瑪莎小姐和一位中國空軍少校如何要好，顯然，那則消息是瑪莎的自我宣傳，她能得到中國空軍少校的埀靑，她的身份自然提高了。</p>
<p>曉市頓一位老太太，邀我在她公寓裏茶敘，邀了十幾位當地作家做陪客，報上登出消息說女作家某某夫人舉辮盛大園會，座中有中國作家某某少校，實際她家裏根本沒有花園，十幾個人黑總　的坐滿了一客堂，大家叨光了一盃咖啡兩片餅乾，被她利用作宣傳的資料。</p>
<p>在聖馬哥斯一家藥房裏偶然認識了一位茀·歐納絲，根本說不上什麼交情，她却利用機會，大事宣傳說一位中國少校如何愛她，因此女友們送她一個徽號，呌做中國婉娃Chinese　Doll，意思是說她是中國人的玩具，她也便儼然以中國娃娃自居了。</p>
<p>在某一個時期，中國人在美國相當吃香，交中國朋友成爲一種風氣，中國人在金錢上是相當慷慨的，當然很容易博得美國小姐的歡心，甚至有不少美國小姐和中國人訂婚及結婚，報紙上把這消息加花邊登出來，認爲是增進邦交促成和平的專訊，其實那些消息都是美國小姐托報館裏的熟人去登的，至少她的名字可以在報上露露臉，出出風頭，在當時嫁中國人是一種時髦之舉。（十）（八）</p>

<h3>Clemency for Traitors on New Year's Day; Ministry of Justice Studying, Too Many Drawbacks May Prevent Implementation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th dispatch] The rumor that the government will issue a general amnesty on New Year's Day of the 37th year of the Republic, reducing the sentences of traitors and allowing bail, has been circulating. According to authoritative sources in the judicial circles here, this news is not yet a fact. It is learned that the news of the general amnesty originated from a proposal related to this matter that was discussed by the Executive Yuan. The proposal was submitted by Zhang Lisheng, Yang Yongjun, Jiang Yuntian, Xu Shiying, and others, with the reason being: "Please expand the scope of the Victory Amnesty, supplement it with an order, to show extraordinary grace and aim for self-renewal." The Executive Yuan decided to hand it over to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for study. The Ministry is currently considering it and may submit it at the Executive Yuan meeting next week. However, according to authoritative sources, the proposal has too many drawbacks, and the Ministry is unlikely to agree, so the expansion of the scope of the general amnesty is unlikely to be implemented.</p>
<h3>Minister Bai Speaks in Xunyang; Emphasizes Public Organization and Training; Willing to Report to the Nation with Facts</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiujiang, 28th dispatch] After the establishment of the Jiujiang Command Headquarters of the Ministry of National Defense, Minister Bai personally planned and deployed military affairs in the front and strengthened public organization and training in Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Henan. When Minister Bai met with our reporter at his command headquarters on the afternoon of the 28th, he stated that he would not engage in empty talk before the National Army achieved significant battle results and would be willing to report to the nation with facts in the future. He believes that Liu Bocheng is currently attempting to establish a base area in the Dabie Mountains, and that Chen Yi and Chen Geng's bandit troops are constantly harassing Jin and Yu, all to cover up Liu's bandits' scheme. However, this work cannot be completed overnight, and we should work hard early to alleviate future troubles. Minister Bai also emphasized the importance of public organization and training work in the future.</p>

<h3>State Council Passes Important Cases; Election of Supervisors and Legislators Postponed; Provisional Councils Should Be Established in Provinces and Cities of Pacification Zones</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th dispatch] The election dates for legislators and supervisors have been postponed due to various practical difficulties. This was approved by the State Council meeting held on the morning of the 28th. Both cases were submitted by the Chairman for discussion. Regarding the election of supervisors, the Chairman received letters from Zeng Qi of the Youth Party and Zhang Junmai of the Democratic Socialist Party. The election date for supervisors was scheduled from November 16th to December 10th. Although the Legislative Yuan passed the method for the participation of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties in the provincial councils, the list of names has not yet been formally submitted, and the number of supervisors has not been decided through consultations between the three parties. How to coordinate in the future will require considerable time for agreement, so please postpone the election date for supervisors from December 16th to January 10th of the 37th year of the Republic to complete the joint constitutional implementation of the three parties. The meeting believed that the first Supervisory Yuan would be convened by the President after the closing of the National Assembly, and the postponement of the election date for supervisors would not hinder the facts, so it was approved. Regarding the election procedures for legislators, the original registration period for candidates was 30 days, from October 22nd to November 20th of this year. On November 21st, the election authorities would handle the review and public announcement of candidates. According to Article 14 of the Implementing Regulations of the Legislator Election and Recall Law, the list of candidates nominated by political parties should be submitted to the Election Headquarters and forwarded to the election authorities before the candidate registration begins. The Election Headquarters stated that the deadline for the public announcement of candidates has passed, and the list of candidates nominated by various parties has not yet been sent. If it is sent now, after being forwarded to the provincial election offices, there are still procedures such as registration, public announcement, printing ballots, and forwarding them to counties and cities. The date for voting (December 21st to 23rd) is very close, and it is impossible to complete the procedures in time. If the candidates who are nominated are allowed to be announced, printed, and elected, then the candidates nominated by various political parties will not be able to participate in the election. This is a major matter, so the Election Headquarters requested that the voting date for the legislator election be postponed by one month, as was done for the election of National Assembly delegates, while the candidate registration deadline would not be changed. This was approved.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kaifeng, 28th dispatch] The supervisory committee members of Yu Province were elected at the provincial council at 9:00 a.m. on the 28th. Guo Zhongchen, Li Mingzhong, Liu Yantao, Yu Zhenzhou, and Zheng Xiaolan (female) were elected.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th dispatch] The case for the establishment of provisional councils in provinces and cities of pacification zones that have not yet established them was approved by the State Council meeting on the morning of the 28th. The case was submitted by Mo Dehui, Yu Jiaju, Hu Haimen, Zhang Ji, Wang Yunwu, and two other people, requesting the establishment of temporary parliamentary councils in the provinces and cities of the pacification zone in order to show respect for public opinion and strengthen the recovery of people's hearts. The purpose was to establish the provisional councils of the eight northeastern provinces. The original proposal stated: "The councils of all provinces and cities across the country have been established one after another, but the councils of the provinces and cities of the Pacification Zone are still lacking. Now, during a time of chaos, the mobilization of manpower and material resources depends on the local people and public opinion organs, which is extremely important. Temporary councils should be established in the temporary locations of the provincial and municipal governments, similar to the temporary councils established in the provinces during the War of Resistance, to assist the government in promoting recovery work. Furthermore, with the upcoming re-election of supervisors, it is even more necessary to quickly establish provincial and municipal councils to strengthen the implementation of constitutional government." The generation of councilors should adopt the method of selection, to expedite. It was proposed at the State Council meeting on the 28th, after a brief discussion, it was approved.</p>
<h3>National Government Orders Supplementary Regulations to Support Candidates of Political Parties</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th dispatch] Supplementary election regulations to ensure the regular election of candidates nominated by political parties were submitted for discussion at the State Council meeting on the morning of the 28th. The case was submitted by Zou Lu and nine other people because, as a result of the National Assembly elections, some party members who were not nominated by the parties were nominated by joint signatures and participated in the elections. The number of nominated and fewer candidates of political parties was greatly reduced. Zou and others proposed the enactment of two supplementary articles to show restrictions, which were approved. It is stipulated in the regulations that all party members who are nominated by joint signatures are invalid. The method of joint signature nomination is only limited to non-partisan social elites participating in the election. These provisions will be officially announced soon, and all legislators and National Assembly representatives, regardless of whether they have been nominated or elected, are subject to these regulations. Nominations that have been made are invalid, and those who have been elected will also have their elected qualifications canceled.</p>
<h3>Signing of International Agreements; Executive Yuan May Approve First, Then Complete Legislative Procedures; The Proposal to Adjust Postage Fees Independently Was Rejected</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th dispatch] The State Council discussed two important cases on the morning of the 28th, both related to the expansion of the powers of the Executive Yuan. One was that the conclusion of international agreements, which must be implemented through legislative procedures first, according to law. In order to facilitate rapid implementation, the Executive Yuan intends to request that in the future, when concluding international agreements, the Executive Yuan may first approve and sign them, and then complete legislative procedures. If any impropriety is found when the agreement is submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative formalities, the Executive Yuan may be informed to negotiate amendments. This case was approved. The other case was that the increase in postage fees should be amended by the Legislative Yuan by amending the Postal Law. The Executive Yuan intends to request that it be approved by the Executive Yuan to independently decide on adjustments based on factual needs, without the need to first discuss it by the Legislative Yuan. This case was rejected. During the discussion, Xu Chuanlin, a member of the Democratic Socialist Party, strongly opposed it. He said: "This matter concerns the burden of the people of the whole country and must be discussed by the Legislative Yuan." It is reported that the case had been rejected when it was previously submitted to the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<h3>US Acting Secretary of State Declares That Aid to China is Proceeding Smoothly; The State Department is Also Preparing a Reasonable Plan</h3>
<p>[United States, Washington, 27th dispatch] Acting Secretary of State Lovett said at a press conference yesterday in response to questions that the aid to China plan is proceeding smoothly. The State Department will set a deadline and prepare a reasonable plan to submit to the regular session of Congress. He said: "China is spending 70 percent of its budget on military affairs and is facing severe inflation, so drafting a relief plan for China is very difficult." He said that in this kind of environment, it is difficult and complex to make aid effective. When asked whether China had replied to the US invitation to discuss the peace treaty with Japan, Lovett said that the note issued by China suggested some voting procedures. He said that there were no new developments in the exchange of notes between the US and the Soviet Union on this issue.

<h3>Losses of Mines and Minerals in the Northeast: Our Country Has Not Filed a Complaint with the United Nations</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Yeh Kung-chao, recently denied a Reuters report from Nanjing which stated: "According to diplomatic circles, our government will have Ambassador Gu Weijun file a complaint with the United Nations regarding the Soviet Union's removal of mining and industrial equipment from the Northeast." Mr. Yeh told this newspaper's reporter, "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not issued any instructions regarding the loss of property in the Northeast." It is understood that our government's current focus and efforts are directed towards the early convening of a peace conference with Japan. Before there is any progress on this matter, we will not raise any issues that could affect these efforts. Therefore, the issue of losses in the Northeast is unlikely to be raised at this time. However, there is no doubt that our country will eventually receive compensation for the enormous losses in the Northeast.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Proposes a Special Meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers in China: Responding to Our Country's Proposal for a Japanese Peace Conference</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 28th] Radio Moscow broadcast on the 28th that Foreign Minister Molotov has responded to China's previous proposal, which compromised between the American and Soviet positions on the procedures for a Japanese peace treaty. He proposed holding a special meeting of the four foreign ministers in January next year to discuss preparations for the Japanese peace treaty. The Soviet Union also suggested that the meeting be held in China. The dispatch added that Soviet Chargé d'Affaires to China, Mr. Feitelenko, has submitted the reply to China. (Continued on page 2, column 1)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 27th, United Press] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov declared at the Foreign Ministers' Conference on the 27th that a peace treaty with Japan is as important as a peace treaty with Germany in order to guarantee world peace. This was the first time Mr. Molotov mentioned the issue of Japan at the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. It is believed that the current conference will not formally consider Far Eastern issues because the conference was originally scheduled to discuss only European issues.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] After news of Mr. Molotov mentioning how the Japanese peace treaty should be conducted at the Foreign Ministers' Conference in London reached here, concerned parties stated: "This may be just a casual remark made by Mr. Molotov after a general discussion of world affairs. If a discussion on the Japanese peace treaty were to take place in any setting without China's participation, it would be difficult to obtain our approval. They believe that Mr. Molotov and the other three foreign ministers would not take futile actions.</p>
<h3>We Have Not Yet Expressed Our Attitude; the United States and Britain Will Reject It</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Regarding the Soviet government's proposal to hold a special meeting of the foreign ministers of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union in China in January next year to prepare for the Japanese peace treaty, a senior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared on the evening of the 20th: "The Ministry has not yet received detailed information about this proposal and cannot immediately express its position. However, we have no objection to the location of the preparatory meeting for the Japanese peace conference. What we are requesting is that the formal peace conference should be held in our country." It seems that this new Soviet proposal is not significantly different from its previously stated and insisted position, which advocates that the Council of Foreign Ministers handle the preparatory issues for the Japanese peace treaty. However, it is a big question whether this can resolve the current stalemate between the United States and the Soviet Union. As for whether the Soviet Union is indirectly rejecting our country's compromise proposal of the 17th regarding convening a preliminary meeting for the Japanese peace conference through this proposal, it will further increase the difficulty in resolving the stalemate.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] The United States has expressed a cool attitude towards the Soviet Union's proposal to hold a special meeting of the foreign ministers of China, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States in China in January next year. The US diplomatic authorities believe that this is the Soviet Union reverting to its old ways, trying to have the major powers monopolize the Pacific peace treaty, just like monopolizing the German peace treaty. The United States originally wanted the eleven countries that actively fought against Japan to jointly draft the Japanese peace treaty. The Soviet Union did not agree and proposed a scheme presided over by the major powers, which the United States rejected in September.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 28th] External sources say that Britain plans to reject the Soviet Union's proposal to hold a special meeting of foreign ministers in China in January next year to discuss the Japanese peace treaty. They say that the note from the Soviet Union proposing the meeting has not yet been received here, but the Soviet Union's proposal is clearly contrary to Britain's views on the procedures for the Japanese peace conference. Officials at the Foreign Office say that the Potsdam Agreement established the Council of Foreign Ministers and clearly restricted it. The British Foreign Office is studying China's proposal to start the Japanese peace treaty discussion in the Far Eastern Commission, and will discuss it with the various Dominions.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Brewing of a Bipartisan Policy Towards China</h3>
<p>Since the US Congress convened a special session to discuss aid to Europe and aid to China, the attention of the US government and public has been focused on the issue of aid to China. In addition to various US newspapers writing articles commenting on the issue of aid to China, Republican leaders Vandenberg, Dewey, Martin, and Judd have also successively delivered public speeches, all advocating that the United States should immediately provide comprehensive assistance to China. Among them, Dewey's six proposals for aid to China, delivered at Columbia University on the 24th, are particularly noteworthy. These six concrete proposals are: 1. Allocate $75 million to $100 million for emergency aid to China; 2. Provide $250 million annually in aid to China for a period of three or four years; 3. Provide additional small loans to purchase military equipment and other military supplies from the United States; 4. Immediately provide all surplus materials in the US Pacific region for the use of the Chinese National Army; 5. The United States should immediately send military personnel to China to serve as technical advisors to the Chinese Army; 6. Appoint "personnel" to manage aid to China. The selection of these personnel must not only have a thorough understanding of the actual situation in China but also have extensive training in politics, economics, and society.</p>
<p>The six proposals of the Governor of New York are not only unanimously welcomed by the government and the public in our country, but also have generated a positive response in American public opinion. For example, Brian Doherty, Chairman of the Fundraising Campaign Committee of the United China Relief, also expressed his strong support, pointing out that China's population is larger than that of Europe, and the suffering from the war is even deeper than that of the European people. Therefore, China's need for American aid is even more urgent than that of the European countries. The New York Times, which has always advocated aid to Europe first, also attaches great importance to Dewey's speech. In addition to publishing the full text of his speech of 5,000 words at once, it also believes that Dewey's speech was drafted after consultation with Republican leaders. From this, it can be seen that Dewey's six proposals can be regarded as the China policy of the American Republican Party.</p>
<p>Since the war, the US foreign policy has "always adopted a bipartisan (Democratic and Republican) policy." Not only are Republican leaders often included in the US delegations attending international conferences, but the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan, which have been implemented in Europe, have also been supported by the Republican Party. However, based on the current US Far East policy, no matter from which angle it is observed, there are still some differences between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Taking the Truman Doctrine as an example, it has been implemented in Europe, but it has not yet been extended to the Far East; taking the Marshall Plan as an example, the US government is currently focusing on the implementation of the aid to Europe plan, but it still feels not enthusiastic enough for the Far East. For example, the aid to China plan proposed by Marshall at the session of the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives on the 11th of this month mainly consists of two points: 1. The United States will allocate $60 million to aid China before July 1 next year; 2. The United States will provide $20 million per month in aid to China from July 30 next year to July 1, 1949, for a total of $300 million. Even if we stand in the position of a third party, from the two perspectives of "timely" and "appropriate amount," we feel that Marshall's aid to China plan may not be effective. Because everyone believes that American aid to China is like a doctor's prescription, it must not only be timely, but also the dosage of the medicine must be "just right." If it is too late, the medicine will lose its effectiveness; if the amount is insufficient, it will be equal to zero. Therefore, to this day, the US government and the authorities should pay special attention to the opinions of Republican leaders on the issue of aid to China and find ways to coordinate and adopt a bipartisan policy towards China. Otherwise, by the next presidential election, the China policy will become campaign material for the Democratic and Republican parties. However, if we examine the opinions of American public opinion on the issue of aid to China, it is not difficult to prove that the American people today all want to maintain close wartime alliance with China and jointly maintain peace in the Pacific; and they all want to help suffering China to become a peaceful, unified, and strong China as soon as possible. Therefore, I predict that in the future, if the two parties use the issue of aid to China as campaign material, the Republican Party will surely gain the support of more voters, which is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>We only need to open a world map. China and the United States are separated by a Pacific Ocean. With the most modern transportation tools, it takes at least five days to travel back and forth once. The United States has never had territorial ambitions for China. Powerful proof can be found everywhere in modern history. However, China has a vast territory, abundant resources, a large population, and a long history of culture, which not only makes the United States extremely willing to be friends with China, but also makes the United States extremely eager to trade with China. Both countries stand on the basis of mutual benefit and equality and jointly promote economic and cultural cooperation between China and the United States. The slogan shouted by the United States in the era of the Boxer Protocol was "Open Door" and "Equal Opportunity." At the Washington Conference, the United States asked the powers to respect China's territorial integrity and sovereign independence. During the War of Resistance, the United States further formed an alliance with China, working together to ensure the victory of the war. After the victory, the United States assisted our country in its recovery. Therefore, in recent years, the American side has added a new understanding, that is, recognizing the importance of China in the Far East. In other words, in the future, whether the United States is dealing with Japan or the Soviet Union, if it does not have China as an ally, then from a strategic point of view, the United States will find it difficult to reverse the situation and turn the disadvantage into an advantage. Therefore, the United States wants China to become a peaceful, unified, strong, and democratic country.</p>
<p>Therefore, we firmly believe that President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall will not ignore the importance of China in the Far East and make a big mistake. Secretary of State Marshall is particularly enthusiastic about China. When he was ordered by President Truman to come to China to mediate, he made the greatest efforts for China's peaceful reunification. Although the mission was not completed, his enthusiasm is deeply imprinted on the hearts of our nation and will never be forgotten. His recently proposed aid to China plan seems too late in terms of timing and too light in terms of quantity. However, his concern for the situation in China and his willingness to help China achieve peaceful reunification have been consistent throughout. A few days ago, he sent a letter to a reporter from the Central Daily News, expressing his concern for the difficulties encountered by China and stating that his $300 million aid to China plan is only a preliminary step in aiding China. Therefore, we really have sufficient reasons to believe that although there is still a considerable distance between the American Democratic Party and the Republican Party on the issue of aid to China at present, with differences in urgency and importance, it is not difficult to coordinate and obtain a bipartisan policy towards China. It can be said that it is currently in the brewing stage.</p>
<h3>Content of the Soviet Proposal</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 1) The full text of the Radio Moscow broadcast is as follows: "It is generally known that the four major powers of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union bear the main responsibility for the war against Japan. When the war was still in progress, an agreement on the issue of post-war peace conditions was clearly reached. The Cairo Declaration, the Yalta Agreement, and the Potsdam Declaration also reflect this point. Furthermore, according to the Potsdam Resolution, the issue of the Far East peace settlement is the responsibility of the Council of Foreign Ministers, and China should participate in this meeting. After the end of the war, the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, with the participation of China, concluded an agreement in Moscow in December 1945, resolving that the four member states should participate in the Allied Control Council for Japan and deciding that the Far Eastern Commission in Washington should adopt the resolutions of the above-mentioned four-nation representative agreements. This point is also recognized by all countries in the special interests related to the post-war status of Japan."</p>
<p>"The various items of the procedure for the Japanese peace treaty proposed in your country's note are also based on the recognition of the above-mentioned four special interests. Your country's proposal indicates the adoption of the various decisions of the agreement on the Japanese peace treaty by the representatives of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. However, your country's note proposes convening a preliminary peace conference for Japan. There is no provision for this in the previous resolutions of the above-mentioned four countries, and it conflicts with the Potsdam Resolution establishing the Council of Foreign Ministers and hinders the restoration of peace in the Far East."</p>
<p>"Therefore, in order to restore peace in the Far East as soon as possible and to enable Japan and its people to enjoy the conditions for peaceful development, the Soviet government will convene a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers in January 1948, with the participation of representatives from China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, to discuss preparations for the Japanese peace treaty."</p>
<p>"If the Chinese government deems it necessary, the Soviet Union suggests that a special meeting be held in China. If your country can reply to this as soon as possible, I will be deeply grateful. If the Chinese government and the other two governments agree, I will also convey the same suggestion to the British and American governments so that preparations can be completed as soon as possible."</p>

<h3>The General Relief Administration's Water Transport Brigade Illegally Carries Commercial Goods; Shipping Industry in Fuzhou Calls for Sanctions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 28th] The transportation boats belonging to the General Relief Administration's Water Transport Brigade have previously violated regulations by sailing to Fuzhou and loading commercial goods. Recently, another boat, the "Wan Heng," arrived from Shanghai empty to load commercial goods and transport them to Tianjin at a low price. Upon hearing the news, the shipping industry in Fuzhou expressed extreme dissatisfaction and sent telegrams to the Ministry of Communications, the Provincial Government, and the national shipping industry, calling for strict sanctions. It is said that according to the regulations of the Ministry of Communications, the transportation boats belonging to the General Relief Administration's Water Transport Brigade are only allowed to transport relief materials from Shanghai to various ports. However, for safety reasons, they can transport government agency materials as ballast when returning to Shanghai. The "Wan Gang," "Wan Xiang," and other boats belonging to the team have previously loaded a large number of commercial goods and returned to Shanghai, which was reported to the Ministry of Communications and expressly prohibited. Recently, the General Relief Administration was dissolved and the transportation work has also been suspended. The authorities are considering disbanding or selling the transportation boats belonging to the Water Transport Brigade to the shipping industry. The "Wan Heng" boat still disregards the prohibition and seizes the opportunity to arrive from Shanghai empty to load commercial goods for profit. Moreover, almost all of the crew members of the team's boats are foreign. This illegal action not only damages the interests of the shipping industry, but also undermines our country's shipping rights. It is hoped that the authorities will promptly impose effective sanctions.</p>

<h3>Huang Yuanbin Discusses US Aid to China: Assisting Our Currency Reform is a Matter of Utmost Urgency</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Mr. Huang Yuanbin, a member of the National Economic Council, recently issued a statement on the issue of US aid to China, as follows: US aid to China is now gradually beginning. Including food relief and cotton loans, it includes the following items: Food relief: According to the Sino-American relief funds, US$30 million will be used to purchase food overseas. This batch of food will be distributed in major coastal cities after it is shipped to China, in order to stabilize prices. The proceeds from the sale will then be used to purchase food inland to provide relief to refugees. Cotton loan: US$70 million. The Marshall Plan originally allocated 300 million yuan for aid to China. The US House Foreign Affairs Committee has approved an interim aid package of US$60 million, which is intended as a supplement to the previous item for emergency relief.</p>
<p>Considering the overall aid to China issue, these four items of relief and assistance are quite small. However, with the initial start of aid to China, the integrated relief, loans, and assistance are being carried out simultaneously. While it is difficult to overcome our country's current economic and military crises, it will make a considerable contribution to temporarily stabilizing the economic situation. In the future, for import trade quotas, the government will not have to bear the foreign exchange burden for importing cotton, food, and other aid goods. It can expand the import quotas for essential raw materials and production equipment to meet the needs of domestic factories, which will gradually reduce smuggling. The demand in the black market for foreign exchange will also be greatly reduced, and it is hoped that it will suppress the prices in the foreign exchange black market. In addition, with a reasonable supply of materials, it is hoped that prices will also stabilize to a considerable extent.</p>
<p>However, with this initial action on the issue of US aid to China, in addition to military assistance, the most urgent matter is assistance in currency reform. If the currency problem is not resolved, the actual purchasing power of fiscal revenue will only continue to decrease, which will only exacerbate currency inflation. Furthermore, under the current economic pathologies, speculation in gold and US dollars and the hoarding of goods are unavoidable, and productive construction is out of the question. Furthermore, due to irrational foreign exchange rates, exports and remittances from overseas Chinese are not as smooth as they could be. Only by reforming the currency system can we change the people's confidence in the currency. Only then can the aforementioned pathologies be fundamentally eliminated. Whether currency reform is successful depends entirely on whether it can restore price levels to those before the War of Resistance. During the currency reform process, any factors that could hinder the restoration of pre-war price levels must be carefully eliminated. The fundamental problem lies in whether there is a substantial foreign exchange reserve. The government currently holds a foreign exchange reserve of US$400 million. If it can be supplemented with another US$500 million, it can start currency reform and achieve the aforementioned goals. However, this kind of credit is just credit. If it can be implemented in accordance with the currency reform plan approved by the Chairman and submitted to the Ministry of Finance, I guarantee that this credit will not be used within two years.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang also stated: I originally planned to go to Guangdong at the end of the month to inspect the economy of South China. However, because there are still some matters pending resolution, I am afraid that the trip to Guangdong will have to be postponed.</p>
<h3>Zhou Yide Speaks: The United States Should Provide Immediate and Substantial Aid to China</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] Congressman Zhou Yide declared today: If the Communist threat in China is not eliminated, the Marshall Plan for long-term aid to Europe will surely fail. If we do not provide immediate and substantial assistance, China will surely be controlled by the Communists. If this situation occurs, the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe will not be successful. The recovery of Britain and other countries in Western Europe depends on trade with the Far East. If the Soviet Union controls the Far East, European recovery will inevitably encounter obstacles. This theory is extremely simple. I completely oppose Secretary of State Marshall's policy toward China. This policy is that we should stop aid to China and wait for it to resolve the issue of the Communists on its own. However, the Communists are determined to control all of China and do not want to compromise with the National Government. If we do not help the National Government, the Communists cannot be defeated. US aid to China is less than aid to Europe. Once the Communist threat in China is eliminated, the Chinese economic structure is still sound, and financial assistance does not have to be very large.</p>

<h3>Principles for Establishing a German Central Government: Britain and the US Support Soviet Proposal; France Requests Establishment of a Border Commission</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] The four foreign ministers held their fourth meeting today. At yesterday's meeting, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and US Secretary of State Marshall simultaneously supported Bidault's request to establish two expert committees to review the eastern and western borders of Germany, as well as Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's proposal regarding the future central government of Germany. Molotov was willing to discuss Bidault's proposal immediately. Although Bevin and Marshall supported the establishment of a German central government, they stated that the government must be based on a constitution that protects true democratic freedom. Bevin also strongly argued that if the nature of the government is not clearly defined, it could become a puppet government and ultimately lead to the danger of dictatorship again.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] The third day of the Foreign Ministers' Conference has still made no progress. When French Foreign Minister Bidault requested the establishment of a German Border Commission, he expounded on the threat posed by Germany's overpopulation to the world. He argued that before discussing the German peace treaty, the German border must first be determined; otherwise, discussing the treaty in a state where the border has not been set is useless. He pointed out that resolutions must be made on two main issues at present: one is to stop the continued migration of people into Germany, and the other is to ensure the safety of Germany's neighbors and establish favorable conditions for their economic recovery. When referring to the Saar issue, Bidault explained that Germany's incorporation of the Saar into the French economic system was motivated by fulfilling the wishes of the local residents. Regarding the Ruhr and Rhine regions, because they are related to security, he will explain them in detail at the next meeting. Bidault then put forward two specific proposals: Regarding the border issue, land claims that are likely to reach an agreement in principle should be handed over to experts for study, and other land claims should be reviewed by representatives of the foreign ministers. Regarding the population issue, no further immigration should be allowed except for those already approved. The emigration of Germans should be decided in consultation with international organizations.</p>
<p>Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov stated that although the Soviet Union knew the importance of the border issue and France's intention to raise this issue at this time, it believed that the border issue should be part of the entire treaty and related issues. The Foreign Ministers' Conference is discussing the German peace treaty, not the establishment of a border commission. Molotov then put forward the Soviet delegation's proposal, saying that it was based on the previous agreement on the following three points: Organize a democratic government for all of Germany; Discuss the draft peace treaty with Germany at the conference; and Prepare basic instructions for the German peace treaty. The Soviet delegation made the following recommendations: Recognize that the establishment of a democratic government for all of Germany is in accordance with the Potsdam Conference resolution; Decide that the German government should state its views on the peace treaty when the German peace conference is convened; The German peace treaty should be signed by a German government and submitted to the German parliament for ratification; The countries participating in the German peace conference should be the five major powers of China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, as well as Germany's neighboring allied countries, and allied countries that sent troops to participate in the war against Germany (Molotov listed a total of nineteen countries, including Albania but not including Iran and Pakistan); Recognize the Yalta and Potsdam resolutions as the basis for the German peace treaty.</p>
<h3>The US Concerned About the Situation in France: Marshall and Bidault Talk at Length; Foreign Ministers' Representatives Discuss the Issue of German Assets in Austria</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] London, 28th broadcast: The fourth meeting of the Foreign Ministers was held today. The chaotic situation created by the Communist parties in France and Italy may prevent the four foreign ministers from reaching any compromise. Marshall and Bidault held lengthy talks, listening to the French Foreign Minister's direct information on the pessimistic situation in France. The United States will take a tough stance on the German issue after confirming the true intentions of Communism, especially in France. Secretary Marshall told Bidault that the United States is willing to provide all possible assistance to France to prevent the rise of extreme forces, as the United States is dissatisfied with both the Communist Party and the de Gaulle faction. However, Secretary Marshall may have informed Bidault that if the United States has to choose between the two, it would rather support de Gaulle than see France controlled by the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] The four foreign representatives of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, who were ordered to review the issue of German assets in Austria, immediately began to discuss the compromise proposal put forward by France at the beginning of today's meeting. The content will classify German assets into two categories: Assets that are of major interest to the Soviet Union, such as the Austrian oil industry and the Danube shipping company, are classified as German assets. These assets will be handled in accordance with the method of transferring property rights to the occupying powers; The debt amount can be used as a long-term debt, which Austria will repay with materials after the signing of the peace treaty on a certain date, all converted into US dollars. At today's meeting, the French representative explained the proposal, but no discussion was held.</p>
<p>[United Press, Vienna, 27th] The Austrian government announced that the Soviet Union dismantled and transported machinery, equipment, and other industrial equipment worth approximately 700 million Austrian schillings to the east during the two and a half years of occupation of Austria.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 27th] The German Social Democratic Party's organ newspaper "Social Democratic Newspaper" today publicly demanded the return of the German territory east of the Oder-Neisse line, which the three powers assigned to Poland in the Potsdam Agreement. The newspaper stated that in order to accelerate Germany's economic recovery in principle, it is necessary to quickly return the nine million expelled Germans from Pomerania and other places to their homes in the aforementioned German territories. It continued that the Socialist Unity Party, under Soviet control, speaks countless times in the name of the German people, because it has accepted the Oder-Neisse line as the final border. The future border issue of Germany is expected to be discussed at the current London Conference.</p>
<h3>Hungary Checks Borders</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 28th] TASS stated, citing a dispatch from the Hungarian capital, that the Hungarian authorities have sealed off the Hungarian-Austrian border.

<h3>The UN General Assembly May Pass the Partition Plan for Palestine; The Arab League Decides to Fight with All Its Strength</h3>
<p>[United Press, Flushing, 28th] After the Thanksgiving break, the United Nations General Assembly will hold a full-day meeting today, and the battle over the Holy Land Partition Plan has reached its climax. The Republic of Haiti seems to have decided to change its position and will turn to support the partition of Palestine. Therefore, there are at least 29 votes in favor, only 14 votes against, and the supporters already have one more vote than the two-thirds majority required to pass the motion. The overall situation depends on those countries that are supported by the United States but oppose the partition this time, because they have not taken any side until now.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Baghdad, 27th] Iraqi Prime Minister Jabr stated that the issue of the partition of Palestine is a matter of life and death for the Arab world. If the Arab army saves the Holy Land, it will fight against all countries, large and small, that support the establishment of a Jewish state. Iraq is determined to do its best to prevent the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine. US and Soviet support for the partition has forever lost the friendship of the Arabs. In addition, Iraqi Senate Deputy Speaker al-Basan said that after the UN General Assembly passes the partition of Palestine, the member states of the Arab League must immediately withdraw from the United Nations, the oil and economic concessions of Arab countries should be revoked, and the Arab army must establish an Arab state in Palestine.</p>

<h3>The United States Concerned About the Situation in Greece: Relief Plan May Be Revised</h3>
<p>[US News Agency, Washington, 27th] Acting Secretary of State Lovett issued a statement on the Greek issue, outlining five points regarding the study of possible revisions to the relief plan: The results of the guerrilla warfare have forced 310,000 refugees to retreat and gather in Thessaloniki and other cities near the guerrilla zone in northern Greece. These refugees have no means of livelihood and rely entirely on national assistance. It is estimated that the number of these refugees may increase to 500,000 by January next year. Approximately one-third of the Greek wheat harvest has been lost due to the recent drought. Of the funds designated as economic targets, US$9 million must be allocated to increase supplies to the Greek Army. The increase in world prices has greatly reduced the purchasing power of Greek relief funds. Under the relief plan after the end of the war, the funds that may be used to assist Greece have been reduced by US$10 million compared to the original plan.</p>

<p>[New Asia Agency, Tokyo, 28th] Democratic Party President Ashida and Transportation Minister Kometi visited Democratic Party senators in the Senate on the 27th to solicit their opinions on the expulsion of 24 senators including Shidehara from the party. Senator Kogure Takeo, representing all the senators, declared: "The senators are not bound by the Democratic Party's resolutions and deliberate the coal mine nationalization proposal from an independent standpoint.

<h3>Dispute Over Extra Tips: Restaurant Employees Petition</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Banquet Economy Group of the City's Economy Supervision Committee recently held a meeting to review the inspection work and ordered all restaurants in the city to post slogans encouraging diners not to pay extra tips.

Therefore, yesterday morning, representatives dispatched by the labor union went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, making two requests: (1) Do not post the relevant slogans in the restaurants; (2) When juvenile police inspect restaurants, do not force employees to "refuse tips." Chen, the Chief of the Tenth Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, received them and replied: The abolition of the tipping system is aimed at changing social customs. The slogans encouraging diners not to pay extra tips must still be posted in restaurants. Paying extra tips is at the diners' discretion and is not a legal issue.

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Xinjiang Youth Song and Dance Troupe, led by the Propaganda Committee of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Beijing on the afternoon of the 3rd of next month and will officially perform at the Queen's Theatre starting December 6th.

<p>Xinjiang's Biggest Stars Are Extremely Excited</p>
<p>According to Liu Mengchun, the Director of the Propaganda Committee of Xinjiang Province, the Secretary-General of the Northwest Headquarters, and the head of the troupe, when he received the press yesterday, he said: The ethnic composition of Xinjiang is complex, with the Uyghur people being the largest group. The troupe is composed mainly of Uyghur members. Two months ago, Zhang Zhizhong toured the area and saw the songs and dances performed by the Uyghur people in various places, which he believed could represent the local culture of Xinjiang. In order to promote understanding between the ethnic groups of Xinjiang and the Han Chinese, he selected dozens of the most outstanding song and dance talents from the north and south and hastily formed the visiting troupe one week before departure. Therefore, their performance in Nanjing was the first collective performance of Xinjiang's biggest song and dance stars. Most of them live more than 1,000 li from Dihua. Since hearing the news of forming a troupe to visit the interior, they have been extremely excited. They have rented out their houses, pawned their clothes, and exchanged them for money.</p>
<h3>Uyghur Flower Refuses Soviet Invitation to Perform</h3>
<p>The Uyghur people have a very strong personality. The troupe members are all confident that their song and dance art is not below the level of world-class song and dance art. Therefore, they insist that if they are to perform in Shanghai, they will either not charge for tickets or the ticket prices must exceed those of Mei Lanfang. They are scheduled to give public performances at the Queen's Theatre for a week starting December 6th, and then select a plaza for a public performance with prices reduced as much as possible to make it accessible to the general public. Miss Kang Bola Han, a female actress of the troupe, is known as the "Uyghur Flower." The Soviet Union has repeatedly invited her to perform abroad, but she has refused. Critics in Nanjing believe that her singing and dancing skills are indeed unique and outstanding.</p>
<p>After the troupe arrives, they are scheduled to stay at the Youth Hostel on Huashan Road. During their stay in Shanghai, they will also use Shanghai as the backdrop to invite He Feiguang to write and direct a song and dance drama, which will be filmed by the Northwest Film Company as a souvenir.</p>

<h3>Unexpected Revenue for Relief Funds; A Wartime Sum in U.S. Dollars and British Pounds Available for Return by the British Bank at Any Time; Municipal Government Decides to Use it to Build Shelters</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Amidst the emergency fundraising for winter relief funds in this city, the Municipal Government suddenly received an unexpected sum, which is quite considerable: US$8,850 and £308. The funds were deposited in the British-owned HSBC Bank in 1938. After the outbreak of war, refugees from various places flocked to Shanghai, and relief was urgently needed. Various charitable organizations in this city organized a committee to send refugees back to their hometowns and launched fundraising efforts, which were quite successful, but not all of the funds were used. The following year, the National Revolutionary Army withdrew, and the funds were deposited in HSBC Bank for safekeeping and have been there for ten years. As the winter relief funds have not yet been secured, the person in charge of HSBC Bank has fully informed Mayor Wu, stating that the funds can be returned to the Municipal Government at any time. After learning about this, Mayor Wu immediately invited Yan Huiqing, Wu Kaixian, Shen Zonglian, and others to form a five-person group to discuss the use of the funds. The group, with Yan Huiqing as the convener, decided to use the funds for winter relief. Secretary-General Shen of the Municipal Government told reporters yesterday that the Municipal Government has decided to use the funds to build a shelter of a larger scale, planning to build a shed capable of accommodating 300 people. All items such as cotton clothing, cotton quilts, shoes, hats, and meals will be provided free of charge. Those admitted must work every day, and wages will be paid accordingly. The daily wage has been decided to be 10,000 to 15,000 yuan per day so that they can accumulate a small amount of money, which can be used as a means of livelihood after the winter is over. Secretary-General Shen also hopes that it can become a social model, and hopes that various charitable organizations can follow suit and set up shelters separately, so that the winter relief problem in this city can be solved.</p>

<p>At the same time, the Maritime Administration has decided to do its utmost to assist in maintaining operations and will assign Chinese pilots to work within days. According to a Customs official, regardless of whether the striking pilots are permanently dismissed or reinstated, the entry and exit of foreign ships should continue as normal within a day or two.</p>
<p>The pilots' association has only 22 members, including two Chinese pilots. The association is tightly organized, making it extremely difficult for outsiders to join. Before the war, each membership quota was worth as much as US$3,000 to US$4,000. They perform an average of about 11 pilotage jobs per day. Forty-five percent of the income goes to the association for expenses, and the rest is divided equally among the 22 members, resulting in very high incomes. Pilotage fees are calculated based on the ship's draft and tonnage. According to pilotage fees for November, each pilot's actual monthly income is approximately 60 million yuan, of which 6 million yuan is specially authorized by our government to be exchanged for US$500 at the official rate of 12,000 yuan per US$1. Therefore, the pilots' strike is generally described as "a strike by aristocrats." According to the person in charge of the pilots' association, they have requested an additional amount from the Customs authorities that would amount to approximately US$3,000 per person per month in actual income.</p>
<h3>Current Income Exceeds That of England and America</h3>
<p>Pilot salaries are very high in all ports around the world, but the current income of pilots in this city is already about a quarter higher than in ports such as London and New York.</p>
<p>It is reported that the two ships, the Gordon General and the Jefferson President, were delayed in Shanghai for a day due to the unresolved pilot strike issue, costing an additional US$9,000. Therefore, they were exported yesterday with water led by barges.</p>

However, the company's manager, Huang Shitian, has not returned from Hong Kong, so Yu Zhang, the person in charge of the import and export department, went to the bureau for questioning. The bureau also seized 992 reams of hoarded paper yesterday from Datongxing Paper Store at 5 Beijing West Road and its warehouse at 22 Ren'an Lane, Guling Road.</p>
<h3>Thief Spotted in Yue Opera Theatre; Red-Clad Woman Steals Ring</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] At the evening performance at the Cathay Yue Opera Theatre on Tibet Road on the 26th, a middle-aged woman from Hangzhou surnamed Xiang bought a ticket and took a seat. She was wearing a seven-carat diamond ring on her hand, which was dazzling. Soon, a woman in red leading a four- or five-year-old girl sat next to her and struck up a conversation. Later, seeing that Ms. Xiang had taken off the diamond ring on her hand and put it in a red oval-shaped leather bag, which she placed next to her seat, the woman pretended to go outside to buy a ticket. Before leaving, she told Ms. Xiang to please take care of the child for her. About five minutes later, the woman returned to her seat and hurriedly took the child and left. Later, Ms. Xiang opened her bag to take out a cigarette to relieve her boredom and discovered that the ring was gone. She realized that it had been stolen by the woman and immediately reported it to the Xincheng Precinct for investigation.</p>

<h3>Visit to Xixi</h3>
<p>Autumn is deep. Some colleagues in Hangzhou took a trip to Xixi. I took half a day off and joined this short trip. To go to Xixi, you need to take a bus from the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau to Liuxia first. Liuxia is where Emperor Gaozong of the Song Dynasty intended to build a palace by the side of Xixi when he was forced to move south. Later, he found that Phoenix Mountain in ancient Lin'an (now Hangzhou) was even better. The Song Emperor then told his entourage: "Xixi should be left behind!" Hence the name. The current Liuxia is a town in Hangzhou County, where rice, tea, silkworms, persimmons, and reeds are produced.</p>
<p>Three Shi per Mu</p>
<p>I asked the locals and learned that this year's harvest is very good. One mu of land can yield three shi of grain. Usually, when milling grain into rice, it is halved. This year, the grains are larger and can be milled at a discount of 16%. Originally, the rent was one shi of grain, but in recent years, due to the 25% rent reduction, only three dou of rice need to be returned. Eleven workdays are spent on one mu of land, with each workday yielding five sheng of rice, totaling eight and a half dou, earning nine dou and five sheng, which is better than in previous years. There are many tourists in Hangzhou this year, and there is not enough tea to sell in the city. The tea in Liuxia has also improved with the trend. The persimmon production is also very good, the silkworm farming is not bad, and the reed grass is in harvest season.</p>
<p>Hiring a Boat to Go to Xixi</p>
<p>Hire a boat from Liuxia to go to Xixi. This type of boat is completely different from the yachts of Xuanwu Lake or West Lake, and the foot-rowing boats of Shaoxing. It is a small and exquisite flat-bottomed boat with a pointed bottom. With a little carelessness, it is easy to capsize. However, on this nearly 20-li stream, the boats coming and going are all these boats. Moreover, old ladies in their fifties and sixties, and little girls of eight or nine years old, are all calmly and leisurely rowing a small boat to Liuxia to go to the market.</p>
<p>Turning Dry Soil to Sow Bean Seeds</p>
<p>Following the stream, the banks are planted with mulberry and persimmon trees. Several farmers are stepping on waterwheels to fan water. It turns out that the weather has been clear for a long time, and water is needed to moisten the dry land so that it can be loosened to sow bean seeds. According to the boatman, "This year's vegetables and next year's soybeans may be affected."</p>
<p>Autumn Snow Temple, Lyricist Shrine</p>
<p>As the boat moves forward, the stream is lovably tender green. The boats rowing towards us are reflected in the stream. In the green waves, you can make out the girl rowing the boat with her white teeth and red lips. Clusters of thin bamboo and clumps of reeds, with reed flowers fluttering in the wind, are very beautiful. Twisting and turning, we arrive at the Autumn Snow Temple. We climb a few steps to the temple gate, which is always closed despite being there. We change direction and enter through the shrine of past lyricists. In the shrine, there are five altars for "Lyricists of Zhejiang," "Lyricists of Zhejiang Who Served as Officials," "Lyricists Who Lived Away from Home," "Lyricists of the Pavilion," and "Lyricists Beyond the World." Inspecting the temple, it is nothing more than four or five single-story houses. There is a two-story building. Climbing the building, we see the three characters "Fingertip Tower." Looking out from the railing, a piece of autumn snow is now in front of us. A gentle breeze blows, and the reed flowers dance in the air, just like catkins flying in the clear autumn.</p>
<p>Grass Worth 50,000</p>
<p>The monk told us, "If it is under the bright moon, and the wind is a little stronger, the reed flowers will be flying all over the sky, wandering aimlessly. It is truly a wonderful sight!"</p>
<p>These ten li of reeds are all born through wind pollination. The reeds can be used to make reed mats, weave baskets, or weave straw sandals with reed flowers. Wearing them in winter is as warm as spring. This type of reed grass does not require artificial cultivation, and each dan can be sold for about 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Families with reed grass often make a lot of profit.</p>
<p>There is also Jiaolu Temple, deep in the reeds. The reed flowers and scenery of Xixi have been famous since the ancient Tang Dynasty. Unfortunately, most people only seek quick success and instant benefits, neglecting the place for purifying the mind and nourishing the nature. Therefore, Xixi appears desolate and deserted today.</p>
<p>Visiting Flower Dock, Appreciating Pine and Bamboo</p>
<p>We picked a few reed grasses and returned to Liuxia by boat, and then took a car back to Huawu. Huawu was also a place frequented by poets and writers in the past. The modern poet Xu Zhimo stayed here for a long time. There is a small mountain path paved with cobblestones. Climbing up the slope, the pine and bamboo are lush, and the mountains rise and fall. Houses appear on the left side of the road from time to time. Some of them are new-style buildings. Next to the bamboo forest is a house named "Youzhu Residence." Passing this, there is a small stream flowing down from the mountain, named "Liuxiang Stream." Unfortunately, it has been clear for a long time, and we cannot hear the sound of the stream. My fellow travelers Huang Hangtian and Shao Yue had originally visited Master ××× Lvfa. Today, we also visited the temple, but no one answered for a long time. We wandered around the side.</p>
<p>An Old Woman Tells Her Life Story</p>
<p>Later, a passerby told us that there was also a cloister-style structure next to the adjacent ××× Temple. So we knocked on the temple gate again, and an old maid opened the door to welcome us in. We saw an old lady holding prayer beads and chanting the Buddha's name. She told us, "The master next door has gone to Mount Fahua. Just sit here!" This old lady entertained us and poured out her life story to us.</p>
<p>It turned out that her surname was ×. She only had two daughters: the eldest daughter married the fourth young master of ×××, who was prominent in the early Republic of China. Unfortunately, the eldest daughter died young. The second daughter also married him.</p>
<p>Daughter Builds a Thatched Cottage for Filial Piety</p>
<p>The daughter was moved by filial piety, so she built several thatched cottages as a place for her mother to cultivate her nature. The fourth young master now has another wife outside and has children. Her daughter is living alone. It is said that the × family is now also in decline. In Shanghai, they don't even have their own house. For more than ten years, this young master has not paid attention to her daughter. Now, prices are high, and life is difficult to maintain. This old lady is already over seventy years old. She also told us that the cloister next door belongs to the × family of Shanghai. This × old lady has not been here for a long time. Mr. × has also died. She often cherishes the past glory. We are vigilant about the era like flying arrows! I never thought that in this idyllic and tranquil environment, there would be such a societal story of rise and fall, prosperity and decline. Yes, we love these natural landscapes today, not to live in seclusion and practice self-cultivation, but to make ourselves sober and not be contaminated by the vulgarity of greed, delusion, hypocrisy, and extravagance!

<h3>Director of Suzhou Provincial Field and Grain Office Arrives in Changzhou to Expedite Grain Collection</h3>
<p>[Report from Wujin, 27th] More than a month has passed since the collection of field tax in this county began, but the amount collected is still very small and has failed to meet the scheduled target. The reasons are: 1. Poor local security. 2. Personnel are separated from the local situation. 3. Last year, the government promised to pay the Yi Tu handlers the full amount of their bonuses, but not a penny was paid, which greatly disappointed the people. It is generally estimated that it will be very difficult to collect grain this year. He Yushu, Director of the Provincial Field and Grain Office, came to the county in person on the 28th with his secretary to expedite the collection. County Magistrate Weng visited the Field and Grain Office to inspect and inquired in detail about the various departments. He decided to leave Changzhou on the 27th.</p>
<h3>Red Worm Disease on Red Head Island; Lin Bingheng Sacrificed His Life, He Shuiquan Was Rescued After Being Chopped</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Taipei, 24th] A very tragic story happened not long ago on Red Head Island (now called Orchid Island), the easternmost outpost of our country, which was surveyed by scientists from this province. The director of the Meteorological Bureau's weather station contracted "red worm disease," and suffered from high fever and delirium. He chopped open the head of an employee in the station with a knife. As a result, the director died, and the employee was finally transported to Taipei for treatment.</p>
<p>Orchid Island (which some propaganda calls a "Paradise"), is inhabited by the Ami tribe, the second most uncivilized ethnic group in the world, and is also home to man-eating red worms and epidemics. When the Meteorological Bureau decided to restore the weather station here, which has strategic value for typhoon forecasting, Lin Bingheng, a 27-year-old youth from Fujian and the leader of the wind-measuring balloon section, was the first to agree to this mission and volunteered to go to this remote and desolate place. On May 31, Director Lin led his staff and the scientific survey team to the island. The original weather station was destroyed, leaving only a wind tower with all the doors and windows destroyed. Director Lin and the workers endured the wind and rain day and night in this tower, buried themselves in sorting things out. Within three months, they did not get a bit of warmth from the world. When they ran out of rice, they took off their clothes and exchanged them with the natives for taro to fill their stomachs. What they were covering with was forever damp quilts that could never dry. They wanted to repair the house, but they could not get money or buy materials. As a result, he fell ill from being bitten by red worms. Telegrams came like snowflakes, trying all kinds of methods, but they could not get even a minimum boat to rescue him. On September 15, the fever increased sharply. In the midst of anxiety, pain, and coma, he desperately chopped the station employee He Shuiquan with a knife, splitting his forehead, nose, and chest. When the knife was taken away by other employees in the station, he could not support himself and died quietly on the 16th. A promising young man who sacrificed everything for scientific work fell silently on this barren island. He Shuiquan was rescued after treatment, but left a deep scar on his face. Lin Bingheng's death is clearly seen in this scar. He died in a state of utter despair.</p>
<p>Orchid Island is also a national defense outpost. Ships sailing between Shanghai, the Philippines, and Hong Kong often dock here. They take many foreign goods ashore to please the primitive tribes, and gradually the natives look down on the Chinese and Chinese officials because the Chinese exchange clothes for taro with them. From this point of view, and for the protection of a scientific worker, we cannot forget its outpost status on the map of the Republic of China, even though the call for transportation and communication is so weak!

<h3>Wuxi Security Team Mutiny Case: Four More Key Criminals Apprehended, Detailed Confessions of Abduction and Brutal Murder</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wuxi 27th Dispatch] On the night of the 28th of last month, a mutiny occurred in the 3rd Squad of the 3rd Company of the County Security Team stationed in Nanfangquan. Machine gunner Huang Shaohua, squad leader Lü Rongguang, and his wife and three members of their family were thrown into the lake and brutally murdered. Wu Jun, a key criminal, had already been apprehended and sentenced to death. A request for execution has been submitted to the higher authorities. On the 23rd of this month, the Criminal Police Team cracked down on a gambling case in Tonghanli, Beicangmen, and arrested more than ten gamblers. Among them were Zhang Guozhang (also known as Zhang Xiaohouzi) and Fu Hengsheng (also known as Lei Gensheng and Xiaogezi), who were criminals involved in the Security Team's mutiny plot. Zhang Guozhang confessed: "I am 32 years old, a resident of the city, and during the enemy puppet regime, I served as a soldier in the 21st Division of the puppet Subei Peace Army. On the 28th of last month, I was invited to Nanfangquan by fellow villagers Gao Dehong (also known as Gao Xiaofuzi), Fu Hengsheng, Lao Sichuan, Wu Jun, and others to join the Security Team as a soldier. Led by Security Team soldiers Shen Yousong, Wu Jun, and a person surnamed Chen, we mutinied, seized firearms, and took them to a boat on Taihu Lake, intending to become lake bandits. Squad leader Lü and his wife and daughter were pushed into the lake by Zhang Fengchi, Shen Yousong, Wu Jun, Gao Xiaofuzi, and others. Then, the boat was sailed to Yixing, transferred to Changzhou, gathered at Baijiaqiao, and then went to Fenshuidun for a meeting, intending to join the lake bandit Jin Asan's forces. Because we did not know anyone, we did not go. At that time, Shen Yousong gave each person a reward of 30,000 yuan. Currently, the person surnamed Chen has been killed in Fenshuidun, and Gao Dehong currently lives near the Sanxing Bathhouse on Weide Road in Shanghai." Fu Hengsheng confessed that he was a resident of the city, lived in Nancangmen, and during the enemy puppet regime, he specialized in robbery in the lake under Cheng Wanjun. He currently makes a living selling rice cakes. He was summoned to the countryside by Gao Dehong and set off that night, boarding two boats. One boat was headed by Gao Dehong, and the other was headed by Shen Yousong." After the team obtained the confessions, they immediately dispatched personnel to Shanghai to investigate and arrest Gao Dehong, who was captured and escorted to Wuxi. On the 27th, he was transferred to the county government for interrogation. At the same time, a suspect named Lü Guangyu was apprehended, and eight machine gun parts of various sizes, one magazine, ten rifle firing pins, nine large lead wires, and five Arisaka rifle bullets were recovered near Shanggaocun at the foot of the mountain in Panjiaqiao, District 8, Wujin County. That night, they were presented to the military law office for verification and handling.</p>

The captain of the Topeka also came to supervise the battle in person. The 20,000-yuan tickets on the floor sold 853 tickets, totaling 17.06 million yuan. The 10,000-yuan tickets upstairs sold 420 tickets, totaling 4.2 million yuan. The total income of 21.06 million yuan will be used as part of the funds for building an activity grandstand. Li Zhenzhong of China United was unfortunately forced to leave the field after only three minutes due to an eye injury that caused bleeding. The battle was quite tense. China United took the lead with 36 to 24 in the first half, ultimately winning by only three points with a score of 60 to 57.</p>
<p>U.S. Troops Take the Lead</p>
<p>Referees were Liu Hesheng and Jin Botao. China United fielded Li Zhenzhong, Bao Songyuan, Wu Chengzhang, Ren Xiangcheng, and Chen Xuechong as the starting five. The U.S. troops deployed Meyer, Weber, Bowser, Beahan, and Kemeny. After the kickoff, Kemeny scored first, followed by Meyer, who made both free throws. Kemeny added another point, giving the U.S. troops a 7-0 lead. China United called a timeout, and Li Zhenzhong left the field due to a recurrence of his eye injury. Liu Mashan substituted.</p>
<p>China United Takes the Lead</p>
<p>Weber and Kemeny continued to be active. China United quickly caught up. Wu Chengzhang dragged the ball into the basket, Xiangcheng broke through from the baseline, and Xuechong made a long shot, closing the gap to 10 to 14. The U.S. troops called a timeout for the second time to adjust their formation, but it was still ineffective. Brother A, Lao Bao, and Fushan successively scored, and China United took a 16-14 lead by two points. Topeka called a timeout for the third time. After resuming play to 22-19, with China United leading by three points, the visiting team stopped again to substitute players. Wu Chengzhang scored a free throw, Weber scored a point, Fushan followed up, and soon Chengzhang made a series of beautiful shots, scoring six points in one breath. The first half ended with China United leading 36-24.</p>
<p>Maximum Distance</p>
<p>After the break, the teams switched sides and resumed the game. Brother A scored the first point, and Zukemeny responded. Lao Bao broke through with one hand, and Meyer scored a free throw, forming a seesaw battle. Later, U.S. soldiers Weber and Meyer became increasingly fierce, while China United also held on tightly, with the score at 52-39, Topeka was still at a disadvantage. The U.S. troops then fought back with reserve forces, and Brother A shot from the baseline, making it 54-39, with China United leading by 15 points, the largest score difference.</p>
<p>Winning by Three Points</p>
<p>Before long, the U.S. troops used a double formation again, showing some improvement, while China United gradually became lax, bringing the score to 53-56. When China United was only ahead by three points, Xuechong broke through, Beahan was dismissed for his fifth foul, and Vanderliet substituted. Xuechong scored another two points, and Kemeny made two free throws. The U.S. troops still had to fight back against the wall, but unfortunately the time had run out. When the bell rang, China United defeated Topeka by 60-57, avenging their previous defeat.</p>

<h3>Peking University's "College of Engineering": Binbin Certifies Its Forty Years of Historical Origins and Final Resting Place in the City of Culture</h3>
<p>— Binbin</p>
<p>The Duan Wang Mansion inside Xizhimen in the old capital, a pioneering industrial education institution, truly has a unique history in this "city of culture." No wonder some old professors and alumni insisted on protecting the school during last summer's merger with Beiyang University and this summer's transfer to Peking University. However, this school's renaming, reform, and transfer have been full of vicissitudes for forty years, and now that it has become the College of Engineering of the highest institution, Peking University, it can be called a good resting place. Looking at it from a purely objective point of view, it may not necessarily be a misfortune.</p>
<p>Now, let's give a concise review of the school's evolution:</p>
<p>"Higher Industrial School" was the earliest name. In 1903, the former Qing Ministry of Commerce (renamed the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce in 1905) founded it to promote industry and cultivate talent. It was founded by Shangshu (Minister) Zai Zhen, and the person who supported and planned it was Tang Wenzhi from Taicang (a Jinshi graduate who served as a special envoy of the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce and as the supervisor of the Jiangnan Higher Industrial School at the end of the Qing Dynasty. I heard a few years ago that this person was still alive and nearing his nineties). Although it was "ministerially established," everything followed the regulations for industrial schools set by Minister of Education Zhang Baixi. Zhang allocated 20,000 taels of silver from the funds of "University Hall" (the predecessor of Peking University) because Peking University's engineering department had not yet been established at the time, so there was surplus funds to be transferred. This school has historical origins with "Peking University" in terms of economics and foundation, which is by no means a matter of one day or two. The school site was initially in Zujia Street and later moved to Duan Wang Mansion. Remedial classes (what are now called preparatory classes) were held for two years, and undergraduate courses were opened in 1907. From the initial establishment to the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, the school's age in this stage was eight years.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Republic of China, all "schools" were uniformly renamed "schools," and this "Higher Industrial School" was renamed "Industrial Vocational School," affiliated to the Ministry of Education, from "ministerially established" to "nationally established." The system was clear, and the position was also stable. After the "May Fourth" Movement, the New Culture Movement trend brought about a craze for "university" names. The number of private universities increased like mushrooms after rain. National vocational schools such as normal schools and communication schools also called for "changing to universities" and "upgrading to universities." Therefore, this school was unwilling to fall behind. After several petitions in 1924, the Ministry of Education approved the promotion to "National Peking Industrial University." After four years, Zhang Zuolin arrived.</p>
<p>First Affiliation with Peking University</p>
<p>Zhang Zuolin called himself "Grand Marshal" in the old capital and established a "military government." His Ministry of Education changed "Peking" to "Capital" for Peking University and changed the departments to "sections," all following the old style of the "Capital University Hall" at the end of the Qing Dynasty, and merged other universities. Therefore, this four-year-old industrial institution was reduced from a university to a department of the university, called the "Capital University Engineering Department." Although that was Zhang Zuolin's trick, the so-called "Capital University" was actually a variant of "Peking University," which can be regarded as the prelude to the current affiliation with "Peking University," which was the first time.</p>
<p>Zhang Zuolin's self-acting "military government" had a short fate. After only a year, he was driven out of the pass by the revolutionary army, and the old capital was unified under the national government. The atmosphere was new, and the school system was also renewed. There was an innovative university district and a "Peiping University" to govern the schools. This industrial school became the "First College of Engineering of Peiping University," and Beiyang University became the "Second College of Engineering." Although Beiyang was a university and had older qualifications, it was listed as the second because its school site was in Tianjin. The "elder brother" became the "younger brother." Twenty years ago, the two schools, which were in different places and unrelated, suddenly became "connected branches," which was also a matter of luck and beyond imagination. The following year, the university district system encountered difficulties, and Peiping University's method of "unifying the heroes" was difficult to convince the public. Peking University, with its seniority and reputation, was the first to stand alone. Beiyang also restored the university. Since there was no so-called "Second College of Engineering," the word "First" was also useless, so it was called "Peiping University College of Engineering." This lasted for eight years from 1929 to the "July 7th" Incident in 1937. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Dissection of the Course of the China United vs. Topeka Battle</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special] China United defeated the Topeka team last night. The process was tight and uneven. The China team once led by a score of 54 to 39, leading by as many as 15 points, but ultimately only won by three points. The evolution of the situation exposed the strengths and weaknesses of both sides.</p>
<p>Da Li left the field a few minutes after entering the game due to a recurrence of his injury. Lao Bao, Brother A, Xuechong, Fushan, and Xiangcheng cooperated seamlessly, maintaining a balance of power at the beginning. Brother A and Wu Chengcheng showed excellent shooting skills, and China United took the lead, maintaining a lead of about five goals for a long period.</p>
<p>U.S. Military's Long Men Wheel Battle</p>
<p>The U.S. military frequently changed people, performing a wheel battle. In fact, there were four more valuable talents: center Meyer, who had a good grasp of near-basket shots and was six feet five inches tall, still maintained a rate of quick running and lively bouncing. Webb and black man Bowser were good at being steady, and Kemeny's dribbling and rushing shots also showed extraordinary skill. However, due to unfamiliarity with the field, it seemed that they could not fully exert their strength.</p>
<p>Compared with China United, the Topeka team seemed to have more skilled passing techniques. Between the black man Bowser and the tall Meyer, there was a brilliant and skillful pass. The black man had a calm mind and was good at taking advantage of opportunities. Meyer took advantage of his height, so the two often cooperated to score points last night.</p>
<p>China United Almost Turned Victory into Defeat</p>
<p>China lacked Da Li, and its mobility was still great, but it lost its composure. Under extreme advantage, the U.S. military took away as many as ten points in one breath. The reason was that Ren Xiangcheng indiscriminately used long shots, without gaining anything. Lao Bao exhausted his strength in the first half, so he had to be lazy in the second half, plus psychological factors, almost causing the situation to turn from victory to defeat. Xiangcheng is currently the weakest shooter on China United, and can only be used as a buffer and pause point for passing the ball. He had the opportunity to shoot but did not shoot, and he dared not shoot when he should have shot last night. If China United wants to compete for the championship with teams such as "Dagong" and "Qingbai" in the future, the above weaknesses should be improved in the short term. (Changnian)</p>

<h3>Next Year's World Games Will Adopt Electric Timing, Technical Problems Assisted by Science</h3>
<p>[British News Agency London 8th Dispatch] Many technical problems in the 14th World Games, scheduled to be held in London next year, are currently being handled with the assistance of researchers from the British National Physical Laboratory. Electric timing, photography at the end of the track race, accurate measuring instruments, duplex telephones and telegrams, radio control of road races, and signaling devices used by referees are all included in the plan. Although it is not often seen for referees to seek help from photos in World Games competitions, it has happened several years ago. The organizing committee for the 1948 Games is considering installing special mirror boxes 60 feet above the ground on the running track of the Wembley Empire Stadium to capture photos of the finish line. All track events may use electric timing. The pistol used by the starter is connected to a circuit, and when the trigger is pulled, the clock at the finish line starts running. This timing system is different for cycling, equestrianism, and rowing competitions. In cycling competitions, the winner will pass a horizontal bar placed on the road at the finish line. In equestrian competitions, the top horse breaks a line. In rowing competitions, the clock is operated by a photoelectric money transfer.</p>
<p>[British News Agency London 28th Dispatch] The 14th World Games are scheduled to be held in London from July 29th to August 14th next year. There are the following seventeen competitive events: athletics, football, basketball, hockey, gymnastics, modern pentathlon, boxing, wrestling, weightlifting, cycling, equestrianism, fencing, shooting, swimming, canoeing, rowing, and sailing.</p>
<h3>Japan to Hold National Games Next Year, Prince Chichibu Appointed President</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Tokyo 28th Dispatch] The Japanese Sports Association Council Committee held a meeting on the 26th and decided to hold the 3rd National Games in Fukuoka from the end of September to the middle of October next year. It was also decided to publicly recommend Emperor's brother Prince Chichibu as the honorary president of the conference. This matter has aroused the political attention of ordinary Japanese people, because at the time of war, Quan Ren was virtually confined by Hirohito due to disagreement of intention. After Japan surrendered, he was not seen in activity. Although he was promoted as the president of the sports conference this time, it seems that he is also regarded as the beginning of Quan Ren's contact with the outside world.</p>

<h3>Chairman Yuan of the Textile Control Committee Convenes a Discussion Meeting; Private Factory Representatives Offer Four Suggestions; Both Sides Approach Agreement on Trial Implementation of Joint Cotton Yarn Allocation</h3>
<p>(Our Dispatch) Yuan Liang, Chairman of the Textile and Silk Control Committee, convened a meeting yesterday at 3:00 PM with several leading figures from private cotton mills at the committee's offices. Those in attendance included Wang Qizi, Tang Xinghai, Guo Dihuo, Liu Jingji, Liu Piji, and Rong Yixin. The meeting adjourned around 6:00 PM. Following the meeting, both Chairman Yuan and the representatives of the private cotton mills expressed that their respective opinions on the trial implementation of joint cotton yarn allocation had become very close. The principles are no longer in question, but the technical implementation issues still require active efforts to find reasonable solutions.</p>
<p>Leading figures from the cotton textile associations of the six districts gathered yesterday at noon to further study the joint allocation trial implementation plan. They decided to contribute four points for consideration to the Textile Control Committee: All jointly allocated cotton yarn should include commissioned spinning cotton yarn to enrich the allocated yarn amounts. Cotton yarn pricing should quickly establish a reasonable calculation formula, based on the principle of taking full account of production costs. The implementation of joint allocation should be based on nationwide standards and equal treatment for all yarn factories, both Chinese and foreign. Concrete measures must be in place to address the issues of raw material shortfalls and capital turnover. The private representatives presented these four points for discussion at the Textile Control Committee meeting, and the results indicate that their opinions are approaching agreement.</p>
<p>After the meeting, Chairman Yuan, in an interview with reporters, stated that the first of the four points raised by the private factories was quite fair. The second point, the pricing issue, may be changed to calculate based on actual material value in the future. The third point was considered to be in line with the original intention of joint allocation, which was intended to be nationwide, but will first be piloted in the Shanghai area, and then gradually extended to the entire country based on the circumstances. The fourth point, raw materials, is a fundamental issue that must be resolved. Funding will also be made available to facilitate financing. In short, the opinions raised by the private factories will be forwarded to the central authorities for discussion and resolution, he said.</p>
<p>In other news: Chairman Yuan of the Textile Control Committee received a telegram from Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan yesterday and is scheduled to fly to the capital this morning. It is reported that the four points regarding joint allocation raised by the private factories will also be presented to the authorities for discussion in order to reach a reasonable solution.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Company Resumes Allotment of Yarn by Yarn Number</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Textile Control Committee yesterday ordered the Textile Construction Company to resume allotting yarn according to yarn number. The allotment method has been changed as follows: All yarn numbers registered with the Textile Construction Company may apply to purchase yarn. The allotment will only announce the count and brand of the yarn. Applicants will fill in the quantity and price they wish to purchase, referencing market prices. Purchase applications must be submitted before 1:30 PM daily. The Textile Construction Company will then determine a reasonable allotment price from the prices offered by the applicants, taking into account the actual market trading prices of the day. This reasonable allotment price will be slightly lower than the market price. If the price filled in by the applicant is lower than this price, there will be no allotment; if it is higher, the yarn will still be allotted at this price. After the quantity and price of the yarn allotted to each yarn number are determined, payment must be made the next day; otherwise, it will be considered a forfeiture, and their yarn allocation qualification will be permanently revoked. Allotments will continue to be made on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, with payments made on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. An additional flood relief donation of 250,000 yuan per bale will be added.</p>
<p>Eight Types of Cotton Yarn Offered for Sale Yesterday</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Recent fluctuations in the black market for cotton yarn are reportedly due to increased raw cotton costs and depleted market inventory. To regulate supply and demand and suppress the black market, the Textile Control Committee has decided to allocate raw cotton to each yarn factory, as reported yesterday. Furthermore, in response to requests from various yarn and cloth merchants, the committee has begun selling cotton yarn in the cotton yarn market, starting yesterday. The sales target is limited to qualified merchants originally registered with the Textile Construction Company. Up to eight types of cotton yarn trademarks are being sold. The quantity and price to be sold are to be reported by the manufacturers themselves.</p>
<p>According to statistics, only 1,400 pieces of 20-count yarn were voluntarily purchased at prices ranging from 30 million to 31 million yuan, which is far from the amount of cotton yarn the Textile Control Committee prepared to allocate that day. As a result, general sentiment is weak, and the black market price of 20-count Jincheng yarn has plummeted by about 2 million yuan. The market outlook for today is expected to decline further.</p>
<p>20-Count Negotiated Price Sees Another Increase</p>
<p>The cotton yarn allocated by the Textile Construction Company to various reproduction industries continued to be sold at negotiated prices yesterday. The negotiated price for 20-count yarn was also adjusted to 28.11 million yuan yesterday. It is reported that the authorities will employ flexible techniques and adopt dynamic methods to maintain the supply of cotton yarn to reproduction industries and the cotton yarn market in the future, in order to combat the black market and ensure that speculators reap what they sow. Also, in order to allocate the 30,000 bales of raw cotton allocated by the National Bank, the Textile Control Committee has issued the following public notice: This committee plans to continue allocating a batch of raw cotton to various yarn factories for commissioned spinning. Any yarn factory that has previously undertaken commissioned spinning with this committee, has a good credit rating, and is indeed short of cotton may come to this committee to apply for procedures from today. This is a special announcement.</p>
<h3>New Speculation Waned, Shanghai Stock Market Weak</h3>
<p>Since a large number of profit-taking bulls left the Shanghai stock market, chips were looser yesterday. The Textile Construction Company allocated a large amount of yarn, and the Four Banks stopped lending, which fueled the selling trend. Squirrel speculators sold off steadily. In the absence of maintenance, the situation deteriorated.</p>
<p>The morning opening was still low. Yong Yarn opened at 424 yuan and 436 yuan for spot and deferred delivery, respectively. Deferred delivery rose from 439 yuan, and although No. 169 advanced, it was not strong for long. No. 104, etc., sold spot delivery, and No. 35, etc., deferred delivery. Although No. 32 advanced in the middle, there was no special rebound and retreated to 413 yuan and 429 yuan. No. 56, etc., bought on dips. The outside interest rate was slightly lower, at 2.4 and 2.85, and once rose to 67 yuan. Finally, because the outside market was much lower than the inside, No. 123, etc., sold spot delivery, and No. 76, etc., delivered deferred delivery. Foreign stocks soared, and No. 56, etc., bought slightly in the middle and struggled a little. The Textile Construction Company allocated a large amount of yarn in the market, and credit will be tight. The outside market was always small. The morning closing spot delivery retreated to 408 yuan, deferred delivery saw 426 yuan, and then ended at a price of 427 yuan. As a result, spot delivery stocks fell by 50% compared with the previous closing, matches and Datong Guanbei fell by 50%, Jinglun Guohuo rose slightly, and the rest fell slightly. Deferred delivery stocks also fell slightly across the board.</p>
<p>The after-market evening report carried the news that the Four Banks had stopped lending, which was even more timid. No. 186 accepted deliveries, and the opening price rose slightly to 410 yuan and 423 yuan. No. 154, etc., sold spot delivery, and No. 207, etc., also sold deferred delivery.

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Spring Willows on the Long Embankment</h3>
<p>— Hong Weifa</p>
<p>Yangzhou Continued Dreams Twenty-Six</p>
<p>Willows and Yangzhou seem to be quite related, probably because of the old Sui Embankment. The Yangzhou Prefecture Chronicle says: "The Sui Dynasty dug canals into the river, and built imperial rivers on the side, planted with willows, which is now called the Sui Embankment." The Emperor Yang of Sui's record of opening the river says: "The decree states that if a commoner has a willow tree, they will be rewarded with a . The common people competed to offer them. He also ordered them to plant them personally, and the emperor planted one himself, and the ministers planted them in order, until the common people. At that time, there was a rumor saying: The emperor plants first, then the common people plant. After planting, the emperor wrote with his imperial brush and bestowed the weeping willow with the surname Yang, saying, It is also the willow." Because there were many willows on the Sui Embankment, and Emperor Yang died in Yangzhou, talking about Yangzhou also meant talking about the Sui Embankment and willows. By the time Wang Yuyang's Yechun Ci, which said, "A stream flows along the northern suburb, the scenery of the Red Bridge is in sight in autumn, the green willow city is Yangzhou," became popular, the green willow city became a different name for Yangzhou, and the willows seemed to be a unique decoration of Yangzhou.</p>
<p>In the past, there were undoubtedly many willows in Yangzhou, and there were even more on the long embankment of Slender West Lake in the northern suburbs. Therefore, one of the eight scenic spots of Yangzhou was called "Spring Willows on the Long Embankment." This Long Embankment Spring Willow, according to the Painted Boat Record, said: "It is on the west bank of the Rainbow Bridge, the gate of Wu's other , opposite to the Yechun Poetry Society." It also said: "Yangzhou is suitable for Yang, and the ones on the embankment are even bigger. They are inserted in winter and live in spring. In three or four years, they will grow two or three feet. Cut off their branches, the middle is hollow, and after the rain, they produce many bacteria like bowls, and the embrace becomes a garden. Clumsy, fat and bloated, without any decoration, or one plant every five steps, two trees every ten steps, in groups of three or five, standing in the garden. The hall is inscribed with Nongyin Caotang, and the couplet says: Autumn water has just added four or five feet, (Du Fu) green shade is separated by two or three families. (Si Kongtu)" In addition, when the Painted Boat Record wrote about "West Garden Meandering Water," it mentioned that there were many willows southwest of the Shangying Building in the West Garden, "the structure pierces through the trees, with long and short lines, drooping eaves and covering the ridge, spring swallows and autumn crows, sunset and drizzle, everything is suitable. There is a Fuliu Pavilion in the middle, and the couplet says: A winding path leads to a secluded place, (Gao Shi) weeping willows caress the fine waves. (Wen Tingyun) The willows in the northern suburbs have reached their full potential here." It can be seen that the willows in the northern suburbs of Yangzhou are very famous, and the spring suburbs of the Long Embankment are the representative works of the willows in the northern suburbs.</p>
<p>Regarding the Spring Willows on the Long Embankment, the Painted Boat Record further said that it was built by the Huang family for Pu, and that Wang Yuanlin was also famous for painting the Spring Willows on the Long Embankment. I don't know if this picture is still in the world today, and the circumstances of Huang's construction of the Spring Willows on the Long Embankment at that time cannot be known. In the current situation, the Long Embankment is still there. In a very dilapidated pavilion on the Long Embankment, there is still a horizontal plaque written by Chen Chongqing, "Spring Willows on the Long Embankment," but only three or five scattered willows remain. In the pavilion's jacket, there is a stone carving of "Record of Restoration of the Spring Willows on the Long Embankment" written by Chen, which says: "The Long Embankment Spring Willow has been included in the eight scenic spots on the lake. Its land starts from the Rainbow Bridge as a dam, and the western part belongs to the Situ Temple. Cui Boting's flower garden in the Yuan Dynasty directly covers half of the dam. Wang Lu Yechun's spring festival has been held here one after another. It is Hong's Yihong Garden, and the current Xu Garden is its location. In the year of Bingchen, Yang Jun Bingyan revitalized Xu, and after doing so, he used private funds to increase and broaden the original dam from the garden to the Rainbow Bridge, planting peaches and willows, forming a shade. A total of silver dollars were used to repair one mile of the dam and plant more than 500 trees. The old traces and the records in the map can be seen by examination." From this, it can be known that the most recent period of restoration of the Spring Willows on the Long Embankment was in the fifth year of the Republic of China, and the person in charge was Yang Bingyan. Yang's name is Yao. This matter is also recorded in the New Chronicle of Jiangdu County: "After Xu Baoshan's death, the people of the country built a garden on the lake to worship Baoshan in it. At first, Wu Ce was in charge of the construction, and when Ce died, Yao succeeded him. It was in the midst of the hot summer days. At that time, Yao was nearly seventy years old and did not fear hard work. After more than a year, he heard that it was completed, and he planted hundreds of willows along the embankment west of the Red Bridge to reach the country, and built a pavilion in the middle for tourists to rest. Today, the trees planted are all lush and drooping. In spring and summer, looking from the east of the Red Bridge, they look like paintings, but it is a pity that Yao did not see it." The New Chronicle only says "plant willows," while the Record of Restoration of the Spring Willows on the Long Embankment says "plant peach and willow trees." As far as the author saw in the past, it was indeed one willow and one peach. In just thirty years, the Spring Willows on the Long Embankment restored by Yang has been destroyed again. There are only three or five scattered spring willows, and not even one peach tree can be seen again. The so-called one-mile-long "Long Embankment" is left exposed. Tourists passing through it feel rugged and dusty, so how can they say, as the New Chronicle says, "In spring and summer, looking from the east of Hongqi, it is like a painting!"</p>
<p>However, looking at the present and thinking about the past, the author was still able to be a person in the picture during the good days of spring and autumn in this Long Embankment Spring Willow more than ten years ago. Three or five close friends, stepping over the Red Bridge, slowly walked from the Long Embankment to Xu Garden. The tin willows on both sides depended on each other, and thousands of strands played with the sleeves of the tourists. For a while, the sleeves of the tourists also seemed to be dyed with a lot of green. In addition, the spring peach blossoms were beautiful, and the cicadas sang in summer and autumn, which made people feel that the dust was gone and the mundane worries were washed away. The pace was unconsciously slowed down a lot, so as to savor the poetry and painting in it. Sometimes, I would personally hold a fishing rod and sit leisurely in the Huai shade, fishing. At this time, whether or not I caught a fish did not seem to be of great concern. I was just appreciating the dancing willow shadows in the water and the floating flowers. In addition to walking, I often traveled back and forth on the Long Embankment by boat. I always wanted the boat to drive close to the shore so that I could easily fold the willow branches. Not to earn anything from this, but I wanted to take them back to mark my travels on the lake. But these scenes have become old dreams for the author. The Long Embankment has long been no longer what it used to be, and the pleasure boats seem to be unable to bear the vicissitudes of life anymore, and they no longer travel along the Long Embankment. I don't know when someone will come to repair the Spring Willows on the Long Embankment like Yang Bingyan again. The author can only have unlimited expectations!</p>
<h3>Miss Shi's Actions</h3>
<p>— Zheng Wuchang</p>
<p>The thirteenth day of the month is the anniversary of Ms. Shi Jianqiao's assassination of Sun Chuanfang to avenge her father's murder. Gathered at Gu Salon, composed this and presented it to her.</p>
<p>She who gave me life died, but I did not die; my not dying was to await the complete avenging of the hatred. With fingers pointing at the Yellow River, a dagger hidden in her waist, not taking a certain head was like water flowing away. A grand plan could not bear to be child's play; circling the pillar was merely a tragic act of a brave man; swallowing hatred, she secretly tracked and waited, using the opportunity to unleash her concealed gnashing of teeth. Years passed, but her resolve did not waver; suddenly, she met her target, almost within arm's reach; her eyes bursting open, her hair pointing upwards, she raised her arm without looking left or right, a loud sound like thunder came from her sleeve, blood splattered in Pu County, and our Buddha rejoiced. The hatred has been completely avenged, what more can she hope for in life? She surrendered herself, seeking death, but the officials did not heed her. How many people throughout history can compare to her filial piety and righteousness? The world is spreading the story of this legendary woman. The Shi family is virtuous, like those of ancient times; the soul of the man who killed her father should be stripped bare; who among those who are sons of men would not be ashamed!</p>
<h3>Fish Paradise (Oil Painting)</h3>
<p>— Hu Yaguang</p>
<h3>Yu Dafu's Poetry and Lyrics</h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>The bad news of Yu Dafu's disappearance from the world has been confirmed over the past two years, based on factual reports from various sources, and there is no doubt about it. The ending of a literary figure with a tragedy is filled with endless sadness and sorrow. At the same time, it makes people feel an indescribable sense of mourning whenever they think of him, and perhaps that is the point.</p>
<p>Dafu's year of birth, according to the lunar calendar, was the year of Bing Shen, the day of Geng Zi, the day of Jia Wu, and the hour of Jia Zi. This was the third day of the eleventh month of the twenty-second year of Guangxu. According to the Gregorian calendar, it was 1896, fifteen years before the Republic of China. He disappeared (was murdered) in the thirty-fourth year of the Republic of China, after the surrender of Japan, at the age of only forty-nine. A generation of literary figures sacrificed to the great era, to borrow a phrase, truly "alas, only this mortal world."</p>
<p>In his later years, the old-style poetry and lyrics he composed as a pastime were deeply accomplished. Although filled with melancholy, they had his own unique style, different from the usual complaining about old age and poverty. Many of them have not yet been published. Now, I will extract some in a miscellaneous manner for everyone's appreciation.</p>
<p>When Dafu moved to Hangzhou, he wrote more travelogues and essays, and fewer novels. In his "West Lake Poetry Collection," such as:</p>
<p>Landscape on the Lin'an Road: "Four or five thatched cottages by the mud wall, two or three camellia buds just sprouting; when the sky clears, men and women are busy farming, leaving a tree of flowers idle in front of the door."</p>
<p>Reading the Lin'an County Chronicle in front of Qin Cao's tomb at Linglong Mountain Temple, I did not find any record of Qin Cao's deeds, but it said that the tomb was east of the temple: "The mountain is exquisite, and the water is clear, Dongpo once visited Yunying here (see the inscription). How can the ten volumes of Lin'an Chronicle not record the story of Qin Cao!"</p>
<p>Leaving Yuling Pass and passing Sanyang坑, the scenery of the winding mountain road is excellent: "How many turns and twists on the winding path, traversing thousands of mountains and ten thousand mountains. Beyond this, there are no three nights of change, coming from the west, and passing another pass. It is said that the streams compete to emerge from Zhushui, and the customs are close to Jianghuai, with a slightly barbaric language. I only regret that the traveling carriage cannot linger, letting the peaches and plums speak of spring idleness."</p>
<p>These are all scenes along the Hangzhou-Anhui Highway. When the highway was first opened, I once traveled along the road. Dafu's descriptions are truly paintings in poetry, especially the winding curves near Yuling Pass, vividly depicted.</p>
<p>On March 9th of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, passing by Yue Fei's tomb, I revised an old work: "Leaning on the lake and mountains, the sun is setting again, turning back the carriage to pay respects to the great king's tomb. The worms and sand have long lost the three towns, and the apes and cranes can now set up an army - the extraordinary merits of Hebei belong to Wei Jiang, and the Jiangnan memorials are thin like Liu Kun. Pitiful are the five hundred sons' blood, which is emptied into clouds on Tianheng Island!"</p>
<p>This was three years after the September 18th Incident, and the Japanese were pressing us step by step. The situation in North China was becoming increasingly urgent, and the central government's countermeasures had not yet been made public. Dafu's poem is filled with endless sighs. He also has a poem "Feeling the Times Passing Yue Fei's Tomb," which contains: "The children of the Northland indulge in ease and pleasure, and there is a reigning emperor who loves romance. The powerful ministers themselves want to make peace, when will the Jin soldiers want Bianzhou!" And a poem presented to colleagues of the Fujian Newspaper: "The elegance of Fujian depends on support, and integrity should be a teacher to the weak; if the country is destroyed and the family broken, facing the flowers! Tears will not become poetry!" His patriotic spirit overflows in his words.</p>
<p>A few days before his fortieth birthday, he wrote two poems with Zhao Longwen: "Building a house at the east gate is accidental, daring to sing the Yinglong chapter about planting melons? I only ask for a full meal and a warm ox coat, and to barely live in the world for another ten years." "Yesterday was Dong Zhou, today is Qin, how can the fish in the pond distinguish Geng Zu? A few points of winter green trees in front of the door, are considered the spring in the Peach Blossom Spring cave."</p>
<p>This can be said to be his poem expressing his aspirations at forty. It is truly a coincidence that he disappeared from the world exactly ten years later, and "barely live in the world for another ten years" became a prophecy!</p>
<p>He has a "Jinlvqu" lyric, which is modeled after Gu Liangfen's lyric sent to Wu Jizi. It is filled with sounds of missing, worry, resentment, and regret. Those who read it should be able to understand his state of mind at that time. The lyric says: "Are you all safe, brothers? Remember when we parted, striking the zither at the capital gate, betting on wine at Han Gao. After parting, time flies like a steed passing a gap, and another year is about to end. I am afraid to tell you about my recent illness and thinness. I am incompetent and accept my fate, but I am most saddened by my old mother and young children. My affairs after death depend on good friends. Half a lifetime of savings, both sleeves filled with wind. I regret that I used to buy laughter with thousands of gold, measuring pearls and discussing buckets. I am too lazy to express my past complaints now, and I am worried that there will be ugliness if I express them. Don't ask if there are any articles! Even if I continue to write the Autumn Willow Draft, the language is absurd, and I will be cursed by ten thousand people. I cannot express everything, your brother bows."</p>
<p>From the saying "poetry expresses aspirations," these poems and lyrics can be said to fully express Dafu's state of mind. We still feel endless sympathy when we read them today.</p>
<h3>Record of Visiting the Teacher and Listening to Instructions</h3>
<p>— Lu Songyin</p>
<p>On January 9th of the 36th year of the Republic of China, together with Jiaotong University classmates Zhu Youneng, Shen Zhikai, Cao Boquan, Lu Runyu, Wang Zhenqun, Zhou Jifang, and Pu Jiufeng, I visited Teacher Tang Weizhi at his Shanghai residence on Jing'an Temple Road. It has been thirty years since we left school. Recalling the late spring of the 26th year, we classmates once traveled to Yixing and Wuxi, paying homage to the relics of Wu and Yue, and ascending to the Hall of Rujing, as if we were standing in the snow at Cheng's gate again, making us reluctant to leave. That evening, we held a public banquet for our teacher at his residence, and we discussed the gains and losses of ancient and modern times. The teacher recited aloud Du Gongbu's "Autumn Hopes" poem, especially the two lines "Kuang Heng presented memorials but his merit book was rejected, Liu Xiang transmitted scriptures but his lifelong wishes were violated," the tone was passionate, like the sound of gold and stone, and the classmates were deeply moved. When we returned to our residence late at night, we were still overjoyed, and the spring breeze of Yi River was no exaggeration. However, in less than a few months, the Japanese invaders acted wildly, like a wild boar and a long snake, devouring the upper country. Shanghai was occupied, and the capital was lost. Many classmates were displaced, and our teacher also fled to Hunan and Guangxi. Those who stayed here temporarily were all cramped like foals under a carriage, seeking to preserve their lives in the chaotic world, but it was not possible, let alone be able to gather together as teachers and students in one room to recount the old days. Heaven pitied us, and the powerful enemy obeyed orders. Classmates scattered and reunited, and recently nearly twenty people have been dancing in various places in Beijing and Shanghai. Although the world situation is bad, it is not hopeless, and the mountains and rivers are fortunately incomplete but restored. Therefore, we planned a way to commemorate this, and everyone said that encountering difficulties is righteousness, like Jizi's Mingyi; speaking out to awaken the deaf, like Ni Shan's wooden bell; we are living in a troubled world, entering and leaving the market of goods and profits, personal desires are growing daily, and heavenly principles are gradually disappearing. If we do not seek correction from those who have the Way, how can we save ourselves in this troubled world! Therefore, we decided to follow the example of Confucius and ask for advice, and Shen Zhikai first went to ask for a time. The teacher heard of this and did not think it was impossible to teach us, but was happy. After giving us the date of the visit, he prepared lectures in advance, and when we arrived, he gave us seats and explained them to us. The teacher said: "The most important thing today is integrity and moral courage! I recently wrote a couplet: 'Life values integrity and moral courage, the world must rely on backbone to support it.' I hope you deeply understand this meaning. If you drift with the tide, like feathers melting in a furnace, you are not my students. People must be determined to be honest and upright, so that their conscience is not obscured, and then they can make progress. Therefore, in today's world, advocating Yangming's philosophy to implement scriptures and teachings is the most urgent task. Nowadays, people are talking about construction, but things have a root and a branch, and things have a beginning and an end. If we abandon the root and pursue the branch, things will not succeed. We must think from the root before we can talk about construction; otherwise, if we forget righteousness for profit in our hearts, and our original intentions are already blurred, how can we handle the great affairs of the world? Su Shi said, 'Those who handle the great affairs of the world, establish the great integrity of the world.' I hope you all encourage each other." From beginning to end, the instruction was diligent and thorough, and it ended after more than an hour. Then we took a group photo to commemorate it, and then thanked him and left. Recalling when we first entered the classroom, the teacher was just over forty, and the students were all in their twenties. How many years have passed, and the teacher is already approaching old age, and the students are also gradually graying. We have not achieved academic success, and we have not established a reputation. Looking back on the past, how can we not feel touched! Although a great person must appear every five hundred years, more than five hundred years have passed since Yangming. Who will follow him but our teacher? The poem says, "The kind and gentle gentleman receives blessings without fail": it also says, "Bless you with your duties and prosperity, bless you with your development and health." I record this in pursuit, to celebrate my teacher's birthday, to encourage my classmates, and also to encourage myself!</p>
<h3>One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Hua Jingfeng</p>
<p>Tsurumi and Pingzi parted ways in Tianjin. However, the first phone call Tsurumi received upon arriving in Tokyo was from Pingzi. Tsurumi asked her, "How did you get back so quickly?" Pingzi did not answer, but all that could be heard on the phone was a series of silver bell-like laughter; "Ge ge ge."</p>
<p>"Big brother, your residence has already been arranged for you; it's not far from Ueno Park, on the top floor - the seventh floor - of that 'New Silk Building'; the scenery outside the window is very beautiful; it can greatly inspire your poetic mood... Big brother, if you have good lines of poetry, be sure to write them down; you know, someone is waiting to see them... But regarding your work, you must also plan it early, your comrades may come to see you tonight... Goodbye, goodbye!..."</p>
<p>"Hey, why do I have to live in that so-called building?" Tsurumi's voice was obviously very rough. But Pingzi did not answer, and after a burst of laughter, there was a "Cha" sound, and the other party had already hung up the phone.</p>
<p>"This girl is really a 'mystery of the devil'! She simply makes people hate and detest her, but there's nothing you can do about her!" Tsurumi inserted this sentence in the midst of our conversation.</p>
<p>"That's called 'coffin bottom - wooden clog feet'..." I couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>"What 'feet'?" Tsurumi became interested in the language.</p>
<p>"Wooden clog feet."</p>
<p>"How do you explain it?"</p>
<p>"The wronged soul won't disperse!" I was once again teaching Tsurumi the national language.</p>
<p>"I don't understand," Tsurumi scratched his head, looked up, and stared at the ceiling with his eyes slanted; "...Oh, I understand!" He laughed: "I remember that's not how they say it outside the pass... it seems to be ..., ..., fire kang?"... That means, a ghost has found you, right? Why is it 'Dou'?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid it's 'coffin board installed on a fire kang', anyway, the two sayings mean the same thing. This 'Guan' is not the meaning of combat, it's the 'Dou bamboo shoot head', the meaning of installing it. This is how it's said in the Yangtze River area; a wronged soul is a kind of 'ghost', but more ferocious than ordinary ghosts, once it finds its 'enemy' it will never let go; just like Miss Pingzi's situation with you now!"</p>
<p>"Humph, the wronged soul won't disperse; but I haven't wronged her, nor do I owe her anything." Tsurumi was a little resentful.</p>
<p>The place where Tsurumi received Pingzi's call was the "Military Friend's Reception Center." In name, it was a reception, but in reality, it was surveillance; without orders from above, without explaining public affairs clearly, you could absolutely not be free.</p>

<h3>Severe Punishment for Corruption in the Ming Dynasty</h3>
<p>— Liuyun</p>
<p>To govern a chaotic world, use severe laws. In today's world where people's hearts are decadent and corruption is rampant, if we can reward the deserving and punish the guilty, without leniency or injustice, we may be able to guide people's hearts and change the world's destiny.</p>
<p>According to Zhao Yi's "Notes on the Twenty-Four Histories": "In the eighteenth year of Hongwu, the emperor ordered the arrest of all officials in the world who harmed the people and sent them to the capital to build the city. When the emperor first ascended the throne, he punished the laxity of the Yuan government and used the law too strictly. Those who carried out the orders stood on tiptoe, and officials who committed crimes were all demoted to Fengyang to cultivate land, numbering more than 10,000 people. According to the "Grass and Wood Zi," the Ming ancestor was strict in governing officials, and allowed the people to go to the capital to report officials who were greedy and cruel. Those who embezzled more than sixty taels of silver were beheaded and their heads displayed to the public, and their skin was peeled and stuffed with grass. A temple was specially built to the left of the prefecture, state, and county government offices to worship the land god as a place for skinning, called the Skinning Temple. A bag of skinned and grass-stuffed corpses was hung in front of the official seats to remind them to be vigilant!" The laws were strict, and all duties were carried out. Ancestor Kai called it reforming the lenient policies of the former Yuan and governing the contaminated followers of old customs.</p>
<p>The Ming Dynasty believed that the Yuan government was lax, so it used strict laws and harsh punishments to make officials vigilant! Thus, all duties were carried out. Beheading and displaying the heads of cruel officials, and then peeling their skin and stuffing it with grass, inevitably makes people feel that the despotism and cruelty of the old era was excessive and inhumane; however, it can be seen from this that the Ming ancestor deeply hated corruption and believed that death was not enough to atone for it. Officials who harmed the people were all arrested and sent to the capital to build the city, and officials who committed crimes were all demoted to Fengyang to cultivate land. This not only reversed the ancient example of "punishments do not extend to high officials," but also showed the Ming ancestor's determination to clean up officialdom and not be lenient.</p>

<h3>Wartime Homing Pigeons</h3>
<p>— Lun</p>
<p>Homing pigeons are one of the oldest forms of military communication, but in this era of such advanced science, they still occupy a high position. These silent messengers have made great contributions in many battles of World War II.</p>
<p>Once, a detachment of Allied troops on the border of Burma and Siam was surrounded by the Japanese army, and a blue-beaked pigeon named Empress of the Jungle carried the intelligence and set off, flying over many high mountains, a distance of 320 miles, and ultimately saved a thousand lives.</p>
<p>Another pigeon named Gyse also saved the lives of a thousand Allied soldiers in Italy. This pigeon later received the Dickin Medal from the Mayor of London. It was the first time that a non-British animal had received this honor.</p>
<p>Also, a male pigeon in the U.S. Army named Bolenie Haliiz was released with a message tied to one of its legs amidst Japanese artillery fire. It fell to the ground covered in thorns after being struck by shrapnel. The message should have arrived in twenty minutes, but it was delayed. However, five hours later, this loyal pigeon, its body covered in blood, finally reached its destination, and the message on its leg was intact.</p>
<p>In French Morocco, a blue-beaked pigeon named "Mrs. Astor" flew ninety miles and delivered important tactical information; during the journey, both of its feet were hit twice, and one wing was also pierced by a bullet. When it completed its mission, it was exhausted.</p>
<p>Pigeon post communication is not only trusted by military personnel, but war reporters also use this bird when they lack other means of communication.</p>
<p>Pigeons in the army are like clerks in the army; they have undergone changes very different from peacetime. Its "home" has changed places, and its habits have also changed. Its duties are new and strange, and it must receive special training to be suitable for a special job, all of which depends on the command of the team to which it belongs.</p>
<p>When carrier pigeons first learn to serve, they either set off with people in jeeps, or are placed on warships or airplanes, or are carried on people's backs, or placed on the shoulders of military dogs, or fly out on secret missions, the secrets of which have not yet been revealed.</p>
<p>The use of pigeons for communication in war began in 43 BC, when the Roman governor Brutus was besieged by Mark Antony in Mutina. The Roman government official Hirtius led a large army to rescue him, and used pigeons to carry secret messages to Brutus.</p>
<p>The use of carrier pigeons for military purposes has made this bird attract international attention. Germany was the first country to build military pigeon houses.</p>
<h3>"Tokyo Rose" and "Axis Sally"</h3>
<p>— Baoqing</p>
<p>"Tokyo Rose," who is still at large and living in Yokohama, recently used her Portuguese husband's family name to apply for a passport to the United States. The State Department has already handed the application over to the Department of Justice for review. However, the American Legion has asked the State Department to quickly try her for her crimes and not allow her to enter the United States and reside there permanently.</p>
<p>American soldiers who fought in the Pacific Theater will not forget this broadcasting hostess from the enemy's side. "Tokyo Rose" claimed in her broadcasts that she was from Los Angeles, USA, and her name was Davis. She had a round face, big eyes, and was five feet two inches tall. She went to Japan with her husband. She worked as a telephone operator at Domei News Agency. After the war started, she applied to be a broadcaster for the Japanese army targeting the United States and was accepted. Every evening from eight to nine o'clock, she broadcast in American English, either telling stories, singing songs, or talking about war matters, to promote propaganda for the Japanese army. Although American soldiers were forbidden to listen to her broadcasts, her sweet words, laughter, and songs would make some American soldiers intoxicated, as if hearing their homeland and loved ones speaking. After the war, an American reporter discovered her whereabouts, and she was arrested shortly thereafter, and has now been released.</p>
<p>And in Germany, Allied soldiers in Europe also heard the voices of American girls coming from there, like sister flowers of "Tokyo Rose." This girl called herself "Axis Sally," and had lived in Porter City in Maine for a long time. Her real name was Mildred Gillars. During the war, she worked hard for the Nazis at the Berlin Broadcasting Station, asking Allied soldiers to leave their troops and return to the "glorious homeland." Naturally, her sweet voice was not as charming and famous as "Tokyo Rose." She entered Germany in 1934. She was detained after the war, and it is unknown whether she has been released.</p>
<p>In the propaganda war, one part of the war, using enemy girls, with their native accents, broadcasting tender sweet words, can have some psychological effect in confusing the enemy's morale.</p>
<h3>Afraid of Having the Same Name as Hitler</h3>
<p>— Chaifei</p>
<p>"Hitler" is a very common name in Austria, as common as Smith in England, Chiron in France, and Ah Mao Ah Gou in China. When the Nazis dominated Europe, those with the same name as Hitler were willing to take advantage of the situation and gain some small benefits, but now still bearing the name "Hitler" is an unbearable burden. In Vienna, there are now 1,500 people who want to change the nickname that symbolizes dictatorship. When the municipal authorities accept applications, they usually conduct an oral examination. As long as the testimony states that they have never been a member of the National Socialist Party, the application can be approved immediately. Recently, when a widow named Frau Franz Hitler applied to change her name, the registration official, seeing the card, said:</p>
<p>"Madam, from now on, you will change your name to Frau Müller, please sign here.</p>
<p>The young wife signed her name, received her identity card, and then naturally gave a Hitler-style salute and shouted:</p>
<p>"Long live Müller!"</p>
<p>The official was stunned, thinking that she must have been a National Socialist Party member before.</p>
<h3>I Love Wang Jinggong</h3>
<p>— Yifeng</p>
<p>"Coming and going alone" is a noble attitude towards life. This attitude is by no means a blind or narrow prejudice, but a spirit of being responsible for the truth. Only those with the character of coming and going alone can be a true warrior and a complete person. (Although often a failed hero.) When they are in troubled times and facing dangerous situations, they will never drift with the tide or forget righteousness for profit; on the contrary, they can show their noble character and awe-inspiring righteousness. The ancient saying "crazy and generous scholars" is close to this.</p>
<p>In history, this kind of independent person should be a lovely and respectable typical character. But most of our historians have a mind that judges heroes by success or failure, so for this kind of independent and failed hero, they are either erased or deliberately suppressed, so that there are not many biographies or the facts are distorted. I personally believe that among the independent figures in history, the great politician of the Song Dynasty, Wang Anshi, should be the most worthy of respect. Although Tao Yuanming of the Jin Dynasty is the most praised, he can only achieve the retirement of being alone and good, and does not have the great ambition to advance and benefit the world, and the active thinking of entering the world. Wang Jinggong is different. He has vision, ambition, and is absolutely responsible for the truth, without the slightest hesitation. In order to express his ambition, he implemented new policies, wanting to revive the Song Dynasty from its accumulation of weakness, regardless of the opposition of important ministers and general scholars such as Fu Bi, Han Qi, and Sima Guang. Moreover, he knew that he could not realize his ideas without being a prime minister or important minister, so he submitted a ten-thousand-word letter to Emperor Renzong, expressing his great ambition to save the country, but Emperor Renzong repeatedly offered him unimportant positions such as judge and recorder of daily life, which he refused to accept. Even if the imperial edict was sent to his home to invite him to serve, he would not sell his face. It was not until Emperor Shenzong appointed him as Jiangning Prefecture, and then granted him the title of Hanlin Academician, that he could carry out his ideas. He would rather live in the wild than be an official. What a lovely spirit this is! Although the result was the failure of the new policies due to improper employment, and he was left with the crime of "greedy prime minister," the opposing veteran ministers should be held largely responsible for this failure. If the veteran ministers at that time could cooperate with him, or at least not obstruct the implementation of his new policies, then the disaster of the Southern Crossing of the Song Dynasty might have been avoided.</p>
<p>When Jinggong was young, his famous line when chanting about pomegranate flowers was: "A touch of red on the thick green flower branches, the moving spring colors should not be too much." This shows that his style is not vulgar, and his accumulation of a mad and generous spirit. When the new policies were implemented and suppressed in many ways, he not only did not shrink back, but also compared himself to auspicious snow, saying; "The great power almost buries the earth, success is only seen when spring returns; the villagers do not know the benevolent intentions, only hope for a clear sky of thousands of miles." What a mind this is! Causing the opponents to retreat. When his new policies failed and he retired, he may have been pained by the failure of his hard-earned new policies, but he was never depressed by his own gains and losses. He lived in a pleasant mood of "sitting by the green mountain and touching the wind, the yellow birds hold books and sleep," which also shows that his heart is open and free of vulgarity. This is worlds apart from the general politicians who are unwilling to be lonely and are trying to make a comeback!</p>
<h3>Appreciation</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>Appreciation is about distinguishing the quality of things, not about commenting on the nobility or baseness of people, this is the rule. However, without a profound and perceptive person, few are not bound by their eyes and ears. As the saying goes, only when there is a Bole in the world, then there are horses that can travel a thousand miles. But relying on ears instead of eyes has been the case since ancient times, not starting from today. Here are a few examples for ridicule.</p>
<p>Zhang Shuai of the Liang Dynasty was intelligent from a young age and loved to write poetry. At the age of sixteen, he had accumulated more than two thousand poems. Yu Na, upon seeing them, criticized them severely. Therefore, he burned them all one day, and wrote more poems to show Na, claiming that they were written by Shen Yue. Na read them and shook his head, praising each sentence, and Shuai then slowly said: "These are also my works." Na was greatly ashamed. Sun Guoting, a famous calligrapher (or said master) of the Tang Dynasty, used to present his proud works to the contemporary dukes and ministers. The dukes and ministers did not know his name and lightly criticized them. Sun then pretended to use a general label and titled them with ancient names, and then the wise and the foolish changed their attitudes, following each other and competing for appreciation. Quality depends on the importance of the person, and this is largely the case. What is appreciation! However, those who can truly appreciate are not lacking in ancient times, such as Xue Zhu who recognized the Qingping sword, Bian He who distinguished the jade, and Cai Yong who did not appreciate and Sun Yang who did not look back casually. This is especially true. As for Gu Kuang of the Tang Dynasty, appreciating Bai Juyi's poems is even more rare: According to Bai Juyi, he once visited Duke Gu with his works. Duke Gu looked at his name and said, "The price of rice in the capital is expensive, and it is not easy to live in." When he read his work, he said, "If you get the meaning of it, living here is not difficult, the previous words were just a joke!" Therefore, he praised him, and his name was greatly shaken. What I mean by rare is that Duke Gu was arrogant at first and then respectful, and he could truly value quality over people. The world is full of chaos, all because they do not know their mistakes, but there are many who clearly know their mistakes but do not change themselves, but continue to act against their hearts. As for Duke Gu, he can be sarcastic.</p>
<p>Miss America</p>
<h3>The Self-Promotion of Miss America</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>"There are none who do not love fame after three generations," this saying can be universally applied, both in China and abroad, in ancient and modern times. And Miss America's popularity is unmatched among her peers. "Loving fame" is not necessarily a bad thing, it is valuable to "love fame without falsehood," and Miss America is almost qualified to be said to "love fame without falsehood." To give an example, a famous Shanghai dancer appearing at the Paramount Ballroom made 20,000 yuan on the first day, actually a 30% discount, only making 6,000 yuan. And even this 6,000 yuan was not the actual amount received, which is somewhat close to "loving fame with falsehood." Americans hate deception the most, so they only "love fame" but can definitely achieve a degree of "no falsehood." They have various methods of self-promotion, especially good at borrowing external forces, but they do not forcibly create situations. Their versatility allows them to participate in and delve into various groups and occasions, and to stand out. It can almost be said that most Miss America contestants are proficient in poetry, literature, music, oil painting, swimming, skating, equestrianism, dancing, ball sports, poker, and drinking. They can attend all diplomatic banquets or social parties and are sure to have a performance appropriate to their status.</p>
<p>One Miss jumped with a foreign envoy or soldier in a dance, and the next day a photo was published in the newspaper, and that Miss was also dragged along for a while. I went to the University of San Francisco to find Martha. She accompanied me on a tour of the school and introduced many female students. The next day, the local newspaper published a news item in the school scene column saying that Miss Martha of the University of San Francisco and a Chinese Air Force major were on good terms. Obviously, that news was Martha's self-promotion. She was able to gain the favor of a Chinese Air Force major, and her status naturally improved.</p>
<p>An old lady in Washington invited me to tea at her apartment, and invited more than a dozen local writers to accompany us. The newspaper published news saying that female writer Mrs. So-and-so held a grand garden party, with Chinese writer Major So-and-so in attendance. In reality, her home had no garden at all. A dozen or so people crammed into a living room. Everyone enjoyed a cup of coffee and two cookies, and she used it as publicity material.</p>
<p>In a pharmacy in San Marcos, I happened to meet a woman named Freddie Onas. There was basically no friendship between us, but she took the opportunity to publicize that a Chinese major loved her very much. Therefore, her friends gave her a nickname, called "Chinese Doll," meaning that she was a toy of the Chinese, and she became known as a Chinese doll.</p>
<p>At one time, the Chinese were quite popular in the United States, and making Chinese friends became a trend. The Chinese were quite generous with money, and of course it was easy to win the favor of Miss America. There were even many Miss America contestants who got engaged and married to Chinese men. The newspaper published this news with fancy borders, believing it to be a special report on promoting diplomatic relations and promoting peace. In fact, those news reports were all published by Miss America, who asked acquaintances in the newspaper office to publish them. At least her name could be exposed in the newspaper, and she could show off. At that time, marrying a Chinese man was a fashionable thing to do. (18)</p>

<p>Reader Consultation　Legal Explanation</p>
<h3>Wife Leaves Home and Doesn't Return, Husband Fears Criminal Charges - A Domestic Dispute</h3>
<p>Editor: Mr. Jia married Ms. Yi last spring. Up to now, it has been over a year, and the couple's relationship is still considered harmonious. However, Yi is naturally arrogant and prone to stirring up trouble. Whenever there is a disagreement between husband and wife, she often attempts suicide. If she dies, it will be difficult to distinguish right from wrong, and she will inevitably be falsely accused by Yi's family. Half a month ago, Yi left home again due to a quarrel. Now there are several questions I would like you to answer in detail. Yi is naive in knowledge and action and has repeatedly threatened suicide. If she is made to write a letter of repentance and asked someone to act as a witness, can this be used as strong evidence in the future that Yi is habitually suicidal in the event of an accident? Yi has now left without informing and has taken jewelry with her. Can she be charged with desertion? If Yi lives in her parents' home for a long time, and Jia does not send anyone to urge her to return, can Yi's family accuse him of abandonment or falsely accuse him of abuse? Is there a time limit for the establishment of the crime of abandonment? If Yi lives in her parents' home for a long time, can Yi's family report Yi's disappearance to the court and accuse Jia?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuang's Answer] Yi's letter of repentance and her suicide are two separate matters. If Jia has no incitement or bullying, there is no causal relationship with her suicide, and he is not guilty. Yi taking her own jewelry elsewhere does not constitute the crime of theft. This is because the law on husband and wife property clearly stipulates it. Yi lives in her parents' home for a long time, and Jia has no abuse or other acts. If there is positive proof, he is not guilty. Refer to Article 294 of the Criminal Law for the regulations, there is no time limit. Yi's mother's family groundlessly accusing Jia is not allowed by law.</p>
<p>Lost Items Notice: Our newspaper's reader, Mr. Xu Faxing, took the express train from Beijing at 10:00 PM on October 9th and arrived at the North Station on the 10th. Because he had to rush to catch the Hangzhou train, he entrusted a classmate to take care of his luggage. On November 3rd, the person returned home from Hangzhou and found that the bedding was missing, including a cotton quilt (the quilt cover is green printed silk), a cotton mattress, a new cotton wadding, and an old gray floral military blanket wrapped outside. If any kind-hearted person or station worker finds it, please write to Xu at No. 94 Longmen Road, Baxianqiao, Shanghai. Mr. Xu is willing to give generous rewards and will definitely keep his word.</p>
