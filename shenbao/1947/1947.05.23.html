<h3>努力促進五國合作　加強中美傳統友誼　王部長在參會報告外交</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕參政會廿二日晨舉行第三次大會，聽取王部長世杰外交報吿。大會於九時一刻開始，李璜主席，副秘書長雷震報吿報到參政員二八一人，廿二日晨出席者二一四人。王氏報吿後並答覆質詢，至十二時五十分散會。下午三時舉行第四次大會，江庸主席，會中由谷正綱作社會部工作報吿，並扼要答覆書面及口頭詢問，旋投票補選主席團兩主席繼任人。休息十分鐘後，五時廿五分繼續開會，由謝冠生作司法行政工作報吿，並口頭答覆質詢，至七時四十分散會。廿三日上午五次大會財政報吿，下午六次大會糧食農林報吿。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿二日電〕王外長在參政會報吿，中國曾提議對日和約簽字後，中·美·英·蘇四國應共同管理日本廿年至三十年，英·美對此已表示同意，惟蘇聯尚未答復。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕王外長廿二日晨在參政會作外交報吿，就（一）對日問題，（二）中·美·蘇·英·法關係，（三）諱國問題，（四）僑胞保護間題等四大部份逐一說明。關於對日問題，王氏指出，日本過去爲我最大敵人，此一問題，不特將影響我國前途，即對世界福祉亦有關係，不可不審慎從事。我對日基本政策，可歸納或下列三點：（一）軍事嚴格，務使日本侵略主義不再抬頭，（二）政治寬大，不干涉日內政，（三）經濟使日本能保持相當生活水準。日本賠償問題，各盟國正商討中，對日本在外國之物資應如何處理，各國間尚未獲致協議，日本國內物資，美方已決定先取出百分之卅予中·菲·荷等四國，我國可得其中半數，我已派員赴日辦理此事。</p>
<p>談及中·美·蘇·英·法關係時，王氏說明爲中國利益計，爲世界利益計，此五大國家間相互合作，實屬必要條件，我外交努力目標，即爲促五國協調合作，更不願因我國情勢，影響五國關係，危及世界將來。就中美關係論，我一貫政策在加強兩國傳統友誼，此一友誼爲最純潔者，不能因任何一方面之批評或妒忌而改變，王氏對馬帥助我遺送三百萬在華日僑俘一事，深致推崇，並信，中美商約之締結，對兩國商務關係之促進，必大有裨益。談及美國對華未來經濟援助時，王謂：我目前需要美方援助極迫切，而美國又為唯一能援助中國之國家，在此抗戰結束未久，經濟急待復與之時，不論就工商實業建設言，皆需外力協助，此事現正由中美綫密研究中，現尚不能爲更詳細之報吿。</p>
<h3>中蘇條約嚴格執行對英關係大體滿意</h3>
<p>關於中蘇邦交，王氏謂：外部辦理中蘇外交，一本上屆參政會「嚴格執行中蘇條約」之決議，根據不遷讓，不超遜兩原則努力。東北七八十萬蘇軍撤退問題，蘇政府去歲會電知我國，謂已於去歲五月三日撤盡，旅大問題，因蘇方謂日本和約尚未簽字，該地仍在戰爭狀態中，我不能派軍前往，我國則認對日戰事實際己結束，現蘇方同意我先派一視察團前往，軍警問題雙方仍交涉中，王氏最後提及莫斯科外長會議時之「不愉快情事」，並說明經我嚴正聲明後，該會內外未討論中國問題。</p>
<p>王氏繼簡略報吿中英，中法關係，謂中英關係大體滿意，中英商約英方對案尚未送到，收回港九問題，英政府已聲明放棄帝國主義政策，我若能努力於加強加深兩國邦交之工作，相信港九問題不難解決。以言中法邦交，主要為越南保僑問題。對韓國問題，王氏聲明我願見獨立朝鮮政府早日成立。最後，王對外部如何處理保僑間題，亦有詳細說明。報吿先後共歷一小時四十分鐘，條分縷析，博得熱烈掌聲。</p>
<p>大會休息十分鐘後，十一時十分許繼續開會，先聽書面質詢，共卅四件，主要集中（一）對日（包括賠償問題），（二）中蘇，特別爲旅大問題，（三）中美（包括貸款），（四）收回澳門·香港，（五）保僑，（六）外交人事六大問題。</p>
<h3>重要待商問題　依照計劃辦理　王外長答詢言簡意賅</h3>
<p>書面詢問畢，即進行口頭質詢，發方者十一人，大部份針對王氏報告，詢問關於對日問題，鄭揆一認王外長所聲明之三項基本政策有加修改必要，渠指出天皇制度一日不廢除，民主的日本即一日不能實現，參會去歲會提請列日皇爲第一號戰犯，外部何不同盟國提出，吾人若任令日本利用國際矛盾，於偽裝民主下重整軍備，則日本捲土重來之時，即九一八重現之日。鄭氏對岡村寗次等迄今仍能逍遙我首都，亦主嚴辦。陳耀東提出吾不能容日本恢復一九三七年之生活水準，整該時爲日本工業最發達時期。陳豹隱以日本通資格提醒國人，日人自視爲天神裔胄，向來蔑視我國，此種錯誤心理，應設法予以根除。對於不干涉日內政一點，陳認美國在日從事整肅運動，我應積極參與。</p>
<p>中蘇問題亦爲質詢集中點，陳耀東認莫斯科外長會議我未能依照波茨坦公約派員參加，實爲莫大失敗，八年抗戰犧牲之後，國際地位反一落千丈，實堪痛心。此外，旅大至今未光復，雙方所組之委會，我方代表又少於蘇方，外交上實有繼續努力必要。潘朝英提出若干迄未公布事實，希望逐一說明。渠主張應將若干國際條約廢止，謝明霄則有更激烈主張。</p>
<p>燕樹棠主張外交應獨立自主，不應採以此制彼政策，其警句有「親中國而後能親外國，吾人應與親中國者相親」。並謂：外交應超出黨派，不應以黨派利益爲利益，而應以中國利益爲利益。基於上述利益，吾人辦外交，不應聽從莫斯科或華盛頓，而應聽從本國人民，與我有利者，我與之握手，反之，即拒絕接近，而不應拘謹於外交詞令與禮節。周謙沖亦特同樣意見，謂我國久戰之後。決不能再經第三次大戰，若因中國外交而使中國成爲第三次世界大戰戰塲，則不特將爲世界罪人，且爲人類罪人。</p>
<p>何葆仁對護僑間題，質間外交當局對於僑胞生命財產感受威脅，採取何種有效措施，並盼對僑胞問題能謀一妥善辦法。何氐指出，荷屬東印度對僑匯限制極嚴，致若干僑胞每月匯回之瞻家費，僅夠吃一餐飯。</p>
<p>對外交人事制度提出質問者，有周謙沖等，周希望當局能樹立一合理制度，並盼能有理想人才配合，蓋外交塲有如戰塲，戰塲需要戰略家配合，外交塲亦需要外交家配合也。</p>
<h3>世界和平關鍵　端視能否合作</h3>
<p>質詢畢，即由王外長口頭答覆，首先提出質詢諸參政員，對彼等所提各種問題，必予注意。繼轉詢諸參政員。我國外交政策是否改弦更張，抑率由舊章，王氏指出世界需要和平，中國需要和平，在此原子彈時代，和平尤感需要，然和平關鍵何在，和平關鍵實在於中·美·蘇：英等國能否合作，此事若有差池，前途實難設想，此言並非危方聳聽，我外交當局現階段不致放棄對促進和平之努力，更不致做出因我人之行爲而引起軒然大波之亨，應忍耐之處，應忍耐，應說話時，說話，君子愛人以德，應說時不容緘默，盼全國人士能支持政府此一政策。王氏醒走另一條路並非難事，然恐尙未深入，即臨危境，此不可不加深思。王指出目前最待解決之重要外交問題約有十三四個，當局對處理此類問題，有其計劃，有其步驟。關於日本賠償問題，戰事時期，我直接死於戰事者，達一千一百萬人，直接財產損失五百十一億美元，我正提出正義公平之要求，將來除機器船舶外，是否尚需有生產機構，過去數月對此曾加研究。關於保僑問題，我不能處處派軍前往，而外國亦有其不同法律，若干國家與我國間且無條約關係，當局唯有真黨涉。王結論謂：當局並無於短時期內將上述各問題逐一解決之絕對把摧，惟仍當努力做去，並盼各方能予信任，答覆共歷七分鈸，言簡意賅，會議於十二時五十分許散會。</p>
<h3>主席團兩主席繼任人選揭曉</h3>
<p>林虎及張君勱兩氏</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿二日電〕參政會廿二日下午第四次會議中，舉行投票選舉主席團繼任人選，由參政員蕭一山，周謙沖，劉中一，張藹真等四參政員監票，選舉結果，林虎，張君勱當選爲主席團主席。</p>
<h3>我旅大視察團又傳月杪出發</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽廿二日電〕旅大視察團最遲於五月底出發，將乘軍體由某地啟程言人選爲董彥平，張劍非，王竹亭，王洽民，朱新民，邱殷，汪源通，吳交甫，徐祖喜等九人。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽廿二日電〕國軍進駐旅大，協助行政人員接收旅大問題，我政府仍與蘇方折衝中。聞蘇方已不堅持前此對駐軍問題之意見，惟認爲旅大仍在軍事時期，促我先成立混合軍委會。</p>
<h3>社會司法兩部長答覆參政員質詢</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕參政會廿二日下午對社會報吿之口頭質詢，大致爲救濟問題，農工問題以及職業團體之立委名額問題。潘朝英認爲社會部辦理社會福利工作及救濟工作，可與各地區之宗教團體及當地慈善機闢聯絡。</p>
<h3>農民重於工商鄉村重於城市</h3>
<p>張潛華強調幾民應重於工商，鄉村重於城市，而目前則反是。張一善更強調政府之忽視農民，認爲組織農民要有技術，不是穿了中山服，西裝可以接近農民的，主要者仍在與農民打成一片，希望政府對此能注意及之。朱惠淸則提出職業團體立委之選舉名額間題，認爲目前業經決定並經通過之立委選舉法中所規定職業團體立委名額僅五十六名，比例不合。朱氏認爲無論以民國廿年國民會議之選舉，民廿六年之國大選舉，均有三分之一以上之比例，此次何以如此規定，是否社部所定標準，擬請谷部長答覆。富保昌提出，在瀋陽，四平街一帶一千至一千五百萬之難民及各地流離失所之熟練技術工人，應予保障救濟，谷正綱答覆略稱，關於我國勞工政策，擬待明年在我國召開之亞洲勞工會議後，根據會議之決定，再訂我國勞工政策，可比較合理。關於救濟，係由行總負責，社部無權支配，即東北難民，因社部特派員辦公處早已撤銷，故亦係由行總辦理</p>
<h3>立委名額問題即將進行複議</h3>
<p>關於職業團體之立委名額問題，係根據此次國大一一〇五〇名中三八〇名識業代表爲準，預定爲一一九名，後立院研討決定改爲五十六名，並業由國防最高委會請立院複議，更爲一一九名，聞立院即將進行複議。</p>
<h3>周佛海免死刑盧前提出質詢</h3>
<p>〔本報南京二十二日電〕謝冠生廿二日在參政會作司法行政報告，係自下午五時四十分鐘始，至六時二十分止，時參政員已相繼退席，聽者稀少，報吿舉宣讀書面報吿數件，並開始口頭詢間，重要者有慮前提出周佛海赦免死刑問題，盧稱：周佛海宣判所經駁斥之事，適均變成赦免令中郝免之理由，如後者可成立，則法院判決由之駁斥，即不應成立，如駁斥成立，自不能以此爲赦免理由，二者必居其一。政府政令與法律不應互相抵觸。盧氏並指出檢舉漢奸時之舞弊情事，陳躍東提出，在華美軍之外治法權問題，如臧大二子案等，均由美軍軍事法庭處理，事關中國司法主權，應予注意，其次司法人員待遇應予提高，大學司法組學生及法律系學生畢業後，何以不能司享檢定考試爲司法官？張邦珍亦提及司法人員生活之改善，張並詢及滬市府秘長何德奎案，何以未能妥爲處理？羅衡對何德奎案亦嚴正提出質詢。羅氏謂，此乃國家法律之尊嚴，何德奎之漢奸案，實不可恕。未有彭革陳提出地方司法機關之腐敢，幾形成爲非作歹之機構。謝氏旋即逐條答覆稱，周佛海案因國府根據國府組織法，可有權提出特赦，乃爲合法者。</p>
<h3>美軍在華犯案並未越權審理</h3>
<p>關於美軍在華刑事案件之處置間題，如華軍在美犯法後，同樣移交在美中國軍事法庭判決。關於大學法律系及司法組畢業同學之檢定考試問題，不久即可解決。至於何德奎案，司法行政部僅係奉行政院命令調查，而不能究辦，惟何氏當時在滬服務，係受政府之委託，故不應處以漢奸罪。答覆舉，羅衡再度起立詢問，認爲必須維持司法尊嚴，表示向謝氏抗議，惟至此尚有書面詢問一件，且時間過遲不及答覆，當宣布散會。</p>
<h3>基本保僑工作　在與各國訂友好條約</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿一日電〕王部長在參會說明保僑工作，認爲哦革命基本政策，爲對於爭取解放與自由的民族寄予同情，比爲三民主義信徒必須信條，即爲我僑民永久利益計，我亦應堅守此信條。因爲我國在南洋一帶僑民，必須與本地民眾友好相處，始能繼續發展其工商事業。近來東印度等地發生戰事，我僑胞之處境極危，我政府之政策與努力，在要求衝突之雙方予華僑以保護，並予華僑以自衛之便利，若干地方已有自衛組織。至目前基本保僑工作，仍在與一切有華僑居留之國家訂立友好條約，使華僑在條約上獲得最惠國之待遇，此等條約，在過去一年間，已完成者頗不少。中邊條約，中菲條約以及中國與若干中南美國家所訂新約，均是此種性質。有了條約的根據，保僑的工作，當可逐步的推進。</p>
<h3>張羣報告全文（續昨）</h3>
<p>到去年八月八日，馬歇爾將軍和司徒大使會聯合發表聲明，表示和平調解難獲協議，政府方面，亦再度表示「政府今後仍求和平解決，商談可以隨時舉行」。凡此均足以表明政府隨時總是不關閉和平商談之門。馬歇爾將軍在炎熱的夏天，八上廬山，尤足以表現調人的熱忱。</p>
<p>在去年十月初，國軍進攻張家口的時候，中共曾提出要求停止進攻，政府已允以十天爲期，并表示對解決時局可能讓步之最大限度，而中共則堅持休戰應無時間的限制，馬歇爾將軍與司大使，又爲此事，於十月八日發表聲明，說明以和平方式解決一切政治問題的重要，「但有若干立待解決之閒題迄難獲致協議」，并指出「此等巳經撤軍地區之地方政府究應爲何種性質，實較軍隊之重新部署問題更難解決」。政府爲企求這個僵局的轉園，仍於十月十六日向中共提出八項諒解，再作最大的讓步，以便下令停戰，如期召開國大，制定憲法。十月二十一日，各黨派代表又再集聚南京，一時和談空氣至爲濃厚，第三方面人士，更是奔走幹旋，提出折衷方案。乃延安方面則根本加以反對，堅持以停開國大爲恢復和談之條件。</p>
<p>政府爲委曲求全，於十一月八日再度頒佈停止衝突的命令，即原定同月十二日舉行的國民大會，復又命令延期三天，使中共有最後考慮的餘地。所有這些經過，均足以充分表明政府是如何企求和平商談，如何重視第三方面人士爲國奔走的熱誠，不幸一切努力與苦心，都沒有結果，這是深可惋惜的一件事！</p>
<p>國大開會以後，中共聲言要恢復和談有兩個先決條件：一個是解散國民大會（後來改爲廢除憲法），另一個是恢復去年一月十三日以前的軍事位置，從此之後，中共將和談的距離愈扯愈遠，但政府只要有一綫希望，仍不放棄與中共合作的初衷。在與靑民兩黨商洽改組政府的過程中，大家覺得如果中共問題不獲得解決，如果中共沒有參加政府，中國的問題仍舊是沒有根本解決，靑民兩黨對於和談，願意與政府再作一度共同的努力，本年一月中旬，經兩黨的中常委到京會談，商定恢復和平方案四條，政府準備派張治中先生携赴延安，與中共方面商治，不料被中共拒絕了。政府仍將此項方案，託美國大使轉達延安，同時發表公吿，使天下周知（方案原文略）。這個方案於一月廿日公佈，同月廿五日中共宣部長陸定一發表了一個聲明，於拒絕和談之外，更對國家元首恣意詆毀，局勢到了這個地步，政府以政治方法解決團內糾紛的願望，雖然誠懇如舊，但政府努力和談的途徑却走窮了。此後中共的表示便是對外否認政府的一切國際行爲，絲毫不留商談餘地。和談不成，應刻由中共負責，事實昭然事，政府無法單獨停戰，也無法單獨言和，但後來政府與　民爾黨及社會　達商定施政方針時，仍於第四項中決定「中共問題仍以政治解決爲基本方封，只須中共願意和平，鐵路交通完全恢復，政府即以政治方法謀取國內之和平統一」。所以今天的問題，不是和談應該不應該的問題，中共不表示願意和平；我們儘管談的熱鬧，何補於事？蔣主席在昨天貴會開會致詞中，對於中共問題，曾經重申政府的立塲。各位先生對於這個問題，關心甚切，但如何能使中共回頭，使政治解決爲可能，祇要於統一，民主，和平，建設的國家需要不相妨，政府決心願意予以最誠懇的考慮。（未完）</p>
<h3>參政會拾零</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　俞振基　張明</p>
<p>王外長廿二日養於參會外交報告，前後共歷一小時又四于分，對日問題報吿最詳，前後達廿八分鐘，對美十八分鐘，對蘇十四分鐘，對英對法各五分鐘，於時間長短之中，亦可見我外交當局權衡各個開題時輕重之一般。</p>
<p>王氏報吿中美關係時，僅提及兩個外國人名，即麥帥及馬帥，王氏對馬帥極推崇，指出馬帥調處和平之功，雖有待將來歷史家下斷語，然其協助遣送三百萬日僑俘歸國一事，其功實不可沒。　報吿中蘇關係時，王氏用字極鄭重，音調亦特別輕低，聽來頗吃力，惟全塲莫不注意靜聽。王報吿時曾一度提及「不愉快」三字。</p>
<p>一般注意之西沙羣易，澳門問題，外交報吿中並未提及。報告中韓關係時，全塲空氣已見鬆弛，時本報及京滬報紙已在會塲散發，參政員紛紛看報，一合灣女參政員則呼呼入唾。　十分鐘休息時，各參政員紛紛閒談，黃宇人與另一參政員批許王外交報吿內容，上海參政員王曉籟，奚玉書等談跳舞應否禁止。攝影記者四出活動，新自日本歸來之謝冰心，成為最好對象。　書面詢問中，有用文言者，有用白話者，趙雪峯質問中謂「當局害了近視瞋毛病，上了某國大當」。　昨日在第二次大會中提口頭詢問諸健將，今日大部袖手旁觀，有一位說「好戲大家唱，老是幾個人說話，人家會聽壓的」。</p>
<p>口頭詢問時，金大校長陳　東發言最激烈，沉痛指出不平等條約取消後，又有新不平等條約產生，治外琺權取銷後，又有新治外法權，五分鐘說滿後，繼續滔滔發言，對若干人之「得意傑作」大事抨擊。</p>
<p>新名詞層出不窮，「失敗主義」，「尾巴主義」時可聰到，讚美名詞亦偶可發見，某參政員譽王外長爲「世界外交家」，王聞後欲「笑」不得。</p>
<p>何葆仁舉例說明，由於若干殖民地國家限制極嚴，華僑每月匯回祖國瞻家費，僅夠一頓飯，若干地方根本就無法匯款。</p>
<p>今日得掌聲最多者爲潘朝英，渠提起「大鼻子」在東北行爲，勸有些人不要一想情願患單柑思病。渠對澳門問題亦有激烈主張，認「對澳門都沒有辦法，還談什麽對美對蘇」，全塲報以熱烈掌聲。</p>
<p>演說姿勢長好者爲燕樹棠，談及外又態度時，燕謂對付「害我們的國家，我們應該伸出拳頭來，拚到底」。說時，以拳用力擊桌，茶杯亦爲之躍起，　王外長答覆時，態度極誠懇，一再說「不是我不敢負責」，並謂「願虛心就教」，短短七分鐘，就將一道難關衝過，同來之葉公超，亦爲之鬆一口氣。</p>
<p>廿二日下午開會時，參政員零落稀少，比較起來，記者多於參政員。某氏稱，記者可居聽政之地位，參政員缺席，聽政者可遞補之，</p>
<p>聽司法行政報吿的人太少，似說明中國人不守法，不愛法，對法多不感興越，不過當律師的參政員們都沒有走開，聽得很是聚精會神。谷正綱報吿時，音調鏗鏘，手舞足蹈，幾乎令人以爲他在指揮一隻交響曲。</p>
<p>下午的會場裏，報紙倒是挺有「銷路」。</p>
<p>梁漱漢進出會塲四次，第一次進來就很遲，坐下來就看座次表，看得津津有味，良久拿起走了；第二次從大門進，繞了一個國兒，又從邊門出去了，沒有坐下來。</p>
<p>孔庚和盧前坐在一排，兩人都有鬍子，一白一黑，兩鬍相遇，總得搭訕一番，實在白鬍太瘦，黑鬍太胖。</p>
<p>女參政員謝冰心，今天早上來了一趨就走了，下午又來了一趟，早退了。記者問她在日本可好。她說：「只是沒得吃，其他什麽都好」。記者間她是不是病得很厲害？她笑笑否認。　部力子夫人今天全日旁總，即便是司法行政報吿，也還是守到散會才走。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>愼防日本重整軍備！</h3>
<p>王外長昨在參政會報吿現行外交時，關於對日問題，其言曰：「我國爲根絕侵略禍患保障永久和平計，對於日本之軍備，主張一律予以解除，凡重工業之足以成爲重整軍備之基礎者，亦均嚴加限制；將來對日和約成立，當由聯合國共同監視之。」這一段話，當可目爲我國政府對於解除日本軍備的一貫立塲，理直氣壯，各盟國宜無異詞。但最近幾天來，日本外務省忽然提出，給予日本以「小量軍力」的要求，以試探各國的態度，殊值吾人之注意</p>
<p>據路透社十八日東京電訊：日本外務省某官員，近曾向各盟國人士探詢，對於日本佔領狀態終止後，設立十萬人之陸軍，以接替美軍及其他盟軍任務之要求，將取何種態度？該官員強調，此一陸空軍爲維持內部秩序，尤其是防止工潮及走私等所必要。這個消息傳出後，雖有十九日外務省的否認；但外國通訊社近來時有關於日本重建軍備消息的傳來，可徵日本外務省的否認，不過是一種官樣文章，掩飾不了事實上的意向。</p>
<p>我們對於這一消息，是萬分注意的。日本這一可驚的要求，不於盟國對日和會召開前夕提出，突於現在提出試探，正說明了盟國管制日本的工作，及麥克阿瑟將軍過分寬容政策的失策；同時又表明了日本的處心積慮，陰猜險很，尚不充分覺醒。美人拉鐵摩爾曾說：日本是個「延期炸彈」，它隨時可以爆發。我們中國，面對這顆炸彈，從甲午戰爭起，歷經半世紀以上的災難；盟國戰勝德日現近兩年，不但對德和約尚未獲得協議，就是對日和會的召開，仍屬渺茫無期，一年多以來，日本在國際關係的夾縫中，出現了許多的花樣；而這次重　軍備要求的透露，火藥氣味最濃，爆炸危險最大，無疑爲世界和平埋伏了危害。</p>
<p>依據波茨坦宣言，日本軍閥的體制，應該摧毀；日本的陸海空軍及軍事工業，應該解散。但這一年多以來，戰氾軍關的審訊延未判決，軍閥殘餘及三井三菱諸豪門，仍多潛伏民間，未被「整肅。」從表面上看，日本軍部是取消了，兵役法也廢止了，大量的陸海空軍已經復員了，一切軍用武器也幾乎完全銷毀了；然在事實上，日本現仍擁有大戰爭機構所需的一切。目前所缺乏的，僅是原料一項。由於國際關係的矛盾，聯合國遠東委員會和東京的麥克阿瑟將軍，對於日本的管制，偏向寬縱，產生了頗可隱慮的後果。最近遠東委員會決定，准許日本保留一九三〇至一九三二年的工業生產力，不啻已經武裝了日本。對日和會尚未召開，美國已先計劃明年六月撤退美軍。佔領軍撤退以後，日本應否受監視，日本應否有武裝，這些都是問題，我們中國人民對於這些問題的關注，自然最爲股切。</p>
<p>最近曾有人詢問麥帥：「在美國佔領軍撤退後，日本怎樣保護它自己？」麥帥答覆說：「方法之一，就是讓它保有小量的軍力。」日本官方對麥帥的表示，歡喜若狂；以爲日本必將負荷「反共壁壘」之任務。所以說，日本要求保有「小量的軍力」並非偶然；蓋由來已久，其意圖以投機取巧，遂行軍國主義之舊夢，昭然若揭。對於此一事態的發展，應該值得國人深深的注意，時時提高警覺。</p>
<p>抑有進者，日本建立十萬陸軍之動機，意圖重襲廿年前德國建軍之故技；以達全面重振軍備的目的。蓋在第一次世界大戰後，凡爾賽條約，雖解除了德國的武裝，但並未肅淸軍國主義的思想，仍准許德國保持常備兵十萬；概用僱兵方式，惟不許有空軍的存在。德國國防部長塞克股，即利用此十萬常備兵，更番訓練爲精兵，每年退伍，每年僱募，不數年間，即成國防軍之基幹，建軍之主力。希特勒的崛起，一聲怒吼，此潛在民間的武力，頓爲百萬千萬的精兵，結果遂演成了第二次世界大戰。如當時凡爾賽條約，根本廢除德國武裝，歷史的演變，想不致陷人類於此次的戰禍。近代日本的軍制，本來模仿普魯士，日本軍人對德國軍事思想，研究湛深；對於德國重整軍備的歷史，認識尤切；所以說，日本要求保有「小量的軍力」，實則薪意翻身，以重溫德國昔日擴軍之舊夢。其處心積慮，我們自最能認識。我們站在維護世界和平的立塲，反對日本重建陸空軍的要求；並希望盟國早日召開對日和會，締結對日和約。關於日本侵略之之防止，及此後日本之管制，美陸軍參謀總長艾森豪威爾曾說：「將來對日相約締結後，佔領任務仍應繼績進行；其方法即由國際警備軍監視日本；同時日本之教育，則由聯合國之民政機構加以民中化艾氏見解，十分正確。我們相信盟國苟能採此步驟，必可防止侵略者主義的再起。希望盟國把握時機，澈底杜絕日本軍國主義的復活！</p>

<p>上海市政府會同警備司令部，昨日訂定四項維護治安的辦法，吳市長且向新聞記者宣布他的四點願望。我們覺得這些辦法能否認眞執行，就是本市治安能否維護的關鍵所在。當局旣然有此宣吿，諒必已有執行法令的決心了，我們且拭目以待。我們更同意吳市長對社會人士的呼籲。因爲我們自始以爲安定社會，不但政府有其應盡的職責，一般國民也同樣有責。政府假使無人民的合作，尤其無善良守法者的合作，就很難發揮它維護治安的效能。例如一宗被盜而不報官，一人被害而不訴究，官員縱屬萬分賢明，亦將感到無能爲力。一個時代，如果正氣消沉，賢良隱匿，大家祇知閉門避禍，惟恐樹葉落下打破頭，只讓那些橫兇霸道的一羣，張牙舞爪，爲所欲爲，社會將不成其爲社會，國家亦將不成其爲國家。故今日之事，少數靑年學生血氣未定，感情橫決，以致行動乖張，缺乏理智，我們以爲還不足深憂；而最可痛者，負有社會責任的一般人，不是袖手旁觀，就只暗地歎氣，而還沒有積極負起責來，爲社會風氣挽狂瀾於旣倒。如果成年人還是婆婆媽媽，搪塞敷衍，以爲過一天是一天，不肯正視現實，辨別是非，尤不願挺身而出，遏止紛擾，勢非使人心渙散，大局魚爛不止。</p>
<p>我們要鄭重提提國人，尤其是上海的市民，必須擁護國府的法令，響應當局的號召，集合正義的力量，制止擾亂的陰謀，我們纔可安居樂業，國家纔可建設復興。千鈞一髮，時乎不再！</p>

<h3>蒙巴頓方案秘密討論中　印度分治大體決定　陸軍國家化問題尚待研究</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿一日電〕權威方面息，艾德禮首相及印督蒙巴頓，巳將印督擬於六月二日向印度領袖提出之移交印度政權程序計劃，吿知反對黨保守黨領袖邱吉爾·艾登·及上院保守黨領袖葛蘭明。艾德禮首相此外，並擬將該計劃知照自由黨領袖台維斯。工黨政府僅事知照反對黨，並不徵求其意見，工黨政府之行動完全出於主動，同時反對黨方面如欲採取任何行動，亦完全具有行動之自由。印督在倫敦進行之談判，係在極端秘密之空氣中進行。官方人士明白表示英國之建議案，須俟印督向印度領袖正式提出後始能公布。外界對建議案之內容揣測雖多，然政界人士已英不皆認印度之實行分治，已屬不能避免。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿一日電〕政府方面消息靈通人士今日聲稱：英國準備將印度分成兩個或兩個以上獨立國，作為解決印度問題之最後一着，並使其中至少一部份保留英帝國殖民地地位。除回敎國與印度敎國外，尚將分成錫克國（錫克族國家）與藩王國（包括五百六十二個藩邦中一部份），此事殆已確實無疑，蓋以印度政治宗敎歧見，根深蒂固，以致往往發生殺人防火等暴勸，勢非分治不可。殖民部長亞迪森乃工黨前輩政治家，現已奉召參加閣議，與印督蒙巴頓有所商討，其故在此。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社新德里廿二日電〕印度陸軍國家化委員會然員伊斯梅，昨夜吿本社訪員稱：印度陸軍或將於明年六月前即英國退出印度之日期前，使之成爲「印度化」。余作此言，乃以調查實情所得之結果爲根據。若干高級將領認爲陸軍國家化尚需費時數年，余則不以爲然，英軍撤退後所留之空額，當將召集復員軍官及民間技術人員補足之。陸軍國家化委員會現對劃分面印軍隊一事，并不加以考慮，此事須至六月二日由軍事專家與政治家組成聯合委員會後，再行加以研究。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社新德里廿一日電〕官方頃公佈：印度陸軍國家化委員會之報告書，內提議將印度陸軍之七個要職，異予印度軍官，包括陸軍總司令·陸軍參謀總長·及新德里陸軍總部司令等職，在戰時曾有大批印度軍官開陞爲准尉，但其中大多數均爲專門人才，若干團之印度團長則爲中校。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社新德里廿一日電〕頃悉，印度國防部長信格，在蒙巴頓返國前，晉謁總督相與談話，曾要求將印度陸軍亦分為巴基斯坦與印度斯坦。據觀察家談稱，此乃國大黨之一種策略，其實國大黨仍希望印度能保特團結，並認爲英國內閣若瞭然印度分裂即印軍分化之謂，則必將竭力避免印度分裂云。</p>
<h3>全印回盟領袖闡述　巴基斯坦之意義　主張與印度斯坦訂立防守同盟　願與近東遠東各國建友好邦交</h3>
<p>〔路透社新德里廿一日電〕全印回教同盟主席真納今日向本社記者發表談話，闡明回盟所要求巴基斯坦之意義，並主張由巴基斯坦與印度斯坦成立同盟。真納談話之要點如下：（一）回盟將要求印度斯坦給予走廊，以聯絡印度西北及東北巴基斯坦之兩部。（二）回盟對於孟加拉及本哲布的省分治之要求，不論寸土尺地，均將奮戰反對。（三）巴基斯坦與英國間，可以建立一真正有利之關係。（四）巴基斯坦與印度斯坦，應樹立友好互惠的關係。（五）巴基斯坦政府將爲人民代表政府。（六）巴基斯坦將聲請加入聯合國機構。　真納對記者所提其他問題之答覆如下：</p>
<p>（問）軍隊如何劃分，是否擬在巴基斯坦與印度斯坦之間，成立防務協定或其他任何性質之軍事同盟？（答）一切軍隊均須完全劃分，余亦主張在已基斯坦爲印度斯坦之間，成立同盟協定或條約，以促進相互間之利益，並防止外界之侵略。</p>
<p>（問）即使本哲布及孟加拉實行分治，贊成建立巴基斯坦國之聯邦否？（答）孟加拉之一部份印度教徒貴族階級及本哲布省之錫克族，發出分治該兩省之呼聲，其實於實行兩省之分治後，對於該兩省尤其是本哲布省之錫克族，將有極不利之影響，而孟加拉東部及本哲布東部之貴族印度教徒，亦將受極大之損失。分治之要求未免缺乏深思，若不幸而英政府竟予同意，對於未來具有極大之危險，余始終主張已基斯坦，應爲得以生存並具有堅強實力以與印度斯坦並立之國。職是之故，本人堅決反對孟加拉及本哲布之分治，不論寸土尺地吾人均將力戰以反對。　（問）巴基斯坦成立後，尚擬自近東中東以達遠東，建立汎回教國否？（答）汎回教國之主義，早巳成爲過去，但吾人爲互惠及世界和平計，自當建立友好關係，並從事合作。巴基斯坦成立後，吾人自當向近東中東遠東，伸出友好之手。</p>
<p>（問）巴基期坦之一般外交政策如何，擬聲請加入聯合國機構否？（答）巴基斯坦外交政策，以維持與各國之和平及友好關係爲宗旨，吾人同時亦擬在聯合國機構中，盡應盡之任務。</p>
<p>（問）巴基斯坦最可能將倚賴何一疆國？（答）信爲對我最有利之強國，其實此非倚賴任何強國之間題，吾人同時當建立友好關係及同盟，使參加此同盟者均蒙其利。</p>
<h3>美報評印局　分治必無成就</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿二日電〕華盛頓郵報今日社評稱，印度回印分治，必無成就，此舉如果實行，人民必須遷移居處，其規模之　大，將爲現代所未曾試行者，目難辦到。蓋過去經騐昭示，人民大舉遷移，肉體與精神雙方，不免大受痛苦，唯橫暴之極權政府始能順利爲之。往昔擬訂凡爾賽和約諸人，重繪歐洲地圖時，依照種族與宗教　分，而不從經濟方面着想，已鑄大錯。印度宗教衝突等問題之答案，似在加強地方經濟，不宜作獨斷獨行之解決，但此答案有背現代政洽之整個趨勢。就現狀觀之，回印分治似被認爲唯一逃避途徑，實則其影響所及，將令印度劃分兩個敵對陣營，分治觀念顯未計及經濟需要，此其弱點所在。真納主張分治，除將　奪印度教徒之最大城市外，並將以印度教徒居多之孟加拉西部與本哲布東部等地區，併入回教治區云。</p>
<h3>美共和黨議員史密斯謂　蘇覬覦阿拉斯加　該處有成為珍珠港第二之可能</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿一日電〕共和黨衆議員史密斯今日在衆院宣稱，「蘇聯現正覬覦阿拉斯加。吾人倘不留意，該處有成爲珍珠港第二之可能」。史氏要求美國軍事專家「制定一種阿拉斯加防禦計劃」，據稱，現有充分證據，可見蘇聯在阿拉斯加上空正在加緊活動。吾人此刻倘能果敢從事，即可在西半球阻止共產主義。史氏旋提議立即徽募軍事人員，派往阿拉斯加服務，勸導平民移殖阿拉斯加，開發天然資源，並發展陸海空軍基地。</p>
<h3>杜魯門總統簽署　美援助希土法案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿二日廣播：杜魯門總統頃簽署援助希土四億元法案，使美國支持弱國抵抗侵略勢力之外國政策發生實效。杜氏稱此舉爲「建立世界和平之重要揹施」，同時證明美國將努力促成和平條件，面維持各國國內秩序與經濟獨立實爲重要之和平條件云。</p>
<h3>美眾院最後批准　對外救濟案</h3>
<p>維持三億五千萬元原額</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿一日電〕政府所提三億五千萬美元國外救濟案今日已經國會最後通過。參院通過該案時，外交委員會主席范登堡宣稱，杜魯門總統現正考慮派遣「富具紅十字會經騐」者多人執行此案。紅十字會副會長艾倫內定將担任要職。衆院亦以二百八十八票對八十六票通過兩院評議委員會調整案，准如總統所請，撥付全數。先是，衆院一部份議員要求將該案交還評議委員會，維持衆院原議，減爲二億美元，但以一百七十票對二百零五票進否決。國外救濟案最後調整案規定受領者爲中國，義大利，希臘，匈牙利，奧地利，波蘭，及特里埃斯特自由區，且至少以一千五百萬美元撥充聯合國機構繁急救濟費。共和黨衆議員裘特於答復責問時宣稱，任何國家使用維持軍隊給養超過定額，總統得令停止救濟。此案與四億，元援助希臘與土耳其防止共產主義一案性質完全不間。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿一日電〕國會今日已通過杜魯門總統所提三億五千萬美元救濟外國一項法案，並已送交白宮，待總統簽署。參衆二院聯席會議業已贊同將比項教濟基金，用以急救奧地利，希臘，義大利，匈牙利，波蘭，中國及特里埃斯特等地之飢荒，所通過之立法措施如次：（一）批准撥款七千五百萬美元，立即開始救濟工作。（二）以一千五百萬至四千萬美元，撥給聯合國，充作救濟歐洲兒童基金。（三）保證此項救濟款項不作政治用途，並由美國代表團監視其分酊情形。</p>
<h3>希南邦交惡化</h3>
<p>〔聯合社雅典廿一日電〕希臘政府今日發表聲明，暗示與南斯拉夫邦交行將決裂。據稱，關於希陸軍武官自南斯拉夫召回一事，希臘曾向南斯拉夫兩次提出　議，該國一再覆文拒　，旣未經釋理由，又無附帶聲明，完全　乏外交禮貌。</p>
<h3>中東各國組織　「反共聯盟」</h3>
<p>〔聯合社報達廿二日電〕外約但駐伊拉克公使亞拉芬尼今日　稱，外約但國王亞勃杜拉擬組議中東各國「反共聯盟」，外約但將　字於土耳其發起之沙達巴特公約，作爲擴大成中東各國聯盟之初步。該約簽字國現有土耳其伊拉克伊朗與呵當汗四國。以求全世界之和平繁榮</p>

<p>〔合衆社傑佛遜城廿一日電〕共和黨總統候選人史泰遜廿一日　請美國採取三年計劃，以及百分之十之糧食及貨物，用以促進全世界和平，集榮及自由。此次史泰遜自歐州遊歷返國之第一次主要外交政策演說。炬在聯合加慶祝會中向三萬五千人稱：美國不應再有捐助性之支付，但應管不得包括軍械國取火在內，並希望政府實行此項計劃時，不得聯越經濟自由之範圍。華萊士所主張之政策，則爲余所反對。諸事自應詢聯合國社會與經濟理事會之意見，但吾人應自行管理此項計劃云。</p>
<h3>美國務院刻正縝密考慮　對外大規模援助　財長史奈德在記者招待會透露</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿一日電〕財長史奈德今日在記著招待會上透露：國務院現正對世界經濟狀況從事大規模之檢討，以考慮可能的對外援助計劃，故美國導家將向外國政府徽求意見。財政部之專家，國家顧問委員會（由國務卿·財長·商長合組之委員會，以處理對外援助計劃者），將與馬歇爾國務卿之專家委員會共同研究此一計劃。馬歇爾昨曾表示在完成研究以前，不致再向國會請求批准新的對外援助案。史奈德今日亦謂美國政府並未接獲英國向美借款之新聲請。渠對紐約「商務日報」社評所稱：「英國爲完成其復興計劃起見，在明年年底以前勢必再向美國聲請借款」之說，拒不發表意見。</p>
<h3>艾克遜呼籲　繼續援助戰災國</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿二日電〕副國務卿艾克遜（現已辭職）昨夜爲「國際貿易週」發表演說，主張美國於一九四八年與一九四九年應繼續援助戰災各國，無論出以緊急貸款或贈送方式，均無不可，惟有如此，乃能打破政治之極端主義。馬歇爾國務卿對此聞題極端重視云。關於此層，據消息靈通人士稱，馬歡爾國務卿日前所謂不致向國會提出貸款與援助之新要朮一節，僅係一九四八年以前不致提出之謂也。</p>

<p>〔合眾社漢城廿二日電〕李承晚與金九向報界發表聯合公報，希望美蘇混合委員會「迅速達成所宣佈之目標，取消北緯三十八度之分界綫，並建立獨立民主政府」。李金之公吿中稱，彼等是否參加混合委員會之討論，當由各個別領袖與團體決定，繼稱：「余等不能盲目依從混合委員會之基本原則，除非兩大重要點能加以滿意之澄淸，所謂託管與獨立政府乃互相矛盾者。故莫斯科決談中之託管辭句，必須加以取消或給予淸楚之定義而加以公布，如此才能肅淸建立獨立政府之道路」。</p>
<p>美代表國主張擴大新聞自由</p>
<p>〔合眾社漢城廿二日電〕混合委員會之美國代表，今日欲在委員會開會期內，提出一項議案，考慮能儘先做到予新聞界以廣汎自由。據信，今日下午一時半參員會在朝鮮王宮召開會務會議時，即擬提出。調查韓僑生活狀況</p>

<h3>聯合內閣困難重重　日政局益見混沌　松岡駒吉當選眾院議長</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿二日電〕民主黨提出之妥協案，雖已於廿二日成立，然自由鯊由於民主黨之拉其議員脫黨以及選舉正副議長等事，在感情上已非常隔　。縱令回復以前協議，再行確認社會黨任首相之四黨聯合內閣，然關於閣僚之分配，比率，及其他發生新困難之可能性仍極大，是以在社會自由兩黨對立之外，自由民主兩黨之對立亦已顯明，而政局亦更加混亂矣。</p>

<p>〔聯合社業盛頓廿一日電〕陸軍部主管日本國際貿易事務人員今日宣稱。麥帥正考慮利用日本一億三千意美元之金準備，繼續資助日本工業復興。此種基金，可以用於自動淸理之企業，如轍入原料而以製造品償付墊款之類。麥帥有權動用此種準備金，此種方案現在此間考慮中，短期內似將完成。一般人士咸知陸軍部主管人員正籌措基金以准廣日本之進口如棉花之類。關於此稱資助之談判，正與建設銀公司在華盛頓進行中。進出口銀行並正考慮設立一公司，目標與此相同。</p>

<h3>雅爾達又一密約　英蘇曾成立遣僑協定</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿一日電〕權威方面息：英當局於五月八日及九日強迫義大利里米尼居留營內之蘇聯公民約一百八十人遣返本國，係根據爾達協定中之又一密約而執行。英外次梅秀今日在下院解釋此等　公民之強迫遣送時，　此等人乃根據雅爾達協定必須被遣之蘇聯公民。然雅爾達協定，上月公布之雅爾達附約，以及一九四六年二月公布有關中國之密約，均無關於遺僑之規定在內，可證雅爾達協定除前此業已發表之密約外，尚有撤僑之密約在。據外交部發言人今夜解籍稱：一九四五年二月雅爾達會議中除成立三協定外，英蘇兩國同時並成立雙方遺僑之協定，其內容除經由半官方面洩漏一部份外，迄今猶未發表。根據該一協定之原來規定，蘇聯戰前疆界內經英軍解放區域內之蘇聯公民，須由英國負責遺返蘇聯，惟當時對不願返蘇之蘇公民是否得強迫遣送之問題，則並未討論及之。其後於發生蘇聯公民不願被遣返蘇之事實時，英政府遂採用美國委克那尼－克拉克指令內所列被遺之原則。該一指令曾由美前國務卿於一九四五年十二月莫斯科會議時，知照莫洛托夫外長，根據該指令規定被遣人員之定義。英國對於於一九三九年九月一日在蘇聯疆界以內，而同時又具有下列情形之一之蘇聯公民，應負責遺送返蘇：（一）被捕時着德軍制服者；（二）一九四一年六月廿二日（即蘇聯參戰之日）歸蘇軍人員而未曾被解職者；（三）蘇當局能證明曾協助敵方者，英外部發言人並聲明此次被強迫自義遣返蘇聯之蘇公民，事先均經慎密調查，其中並無疑案云</p>

<h3>煽動罷工罷課者　決依戒嚴法究辦　吳市長宣司令商定四項辦法　希望青年用理智解決問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長因最近本市學潮汹湧，影響治安甚鉅，昨特與警備司令宣鐵吾氏會商後，根據國家原有法令，發表辦法四項如下：</p>
<p>（一）煽動罷工罷課者，無論何人，可由工廠商店或工人商人，報吿該管分局，或警備司令部予以究辦，照戒嚴法第九條辦理。</p>
<p>（二）非本學校之學生，前往各學校宣傳演講者，各校當局可予拒絕，其不接受者，可報該管分局，照妨害公務及秩序罪辦理。</p>
<p>（三）佔據學校之財產，不任學校使用者，由學校當局飭令遷出，其不遷出者，可由學校當局報吿該管分局照妨害公務及侵佔罪辦理。</p>
<p>（四）學生自願上課者，可向各學校當局申請，由學校當局轉請該管分局保護，其阻止上項學生復課者，可由學校當局或學生報吿該管分局，照妨害自由罪辦理。</p>
<h3>市長分析學潮內幕</h3>
<p>吳市長於昨晚五時招待記者時聲稱：目前上海市民所一致要求者爲安定秩序，對於學潮之洶湧，使社會蒙受重大影響，咸引以爲憾。本人對於靑年學子，素極愛護，然分析最近本市學潮內容，獲得結論如下：（一）最近本市谷校，均以各不相同之問題，掀起罷課風潮，及至各循合理途徑謀求解決之時，輒有新事件發生，致市府方面無法按照原定計劃，以謀事件之逐步解決。（二）各校舉生之行動，原屬天眞可愛，但有少數學生之行動，卻已越出法律範圍。諸如曁大學生包圍校長住所，致校長夫人受驚跳窗墜塲；，大同學生羣赴校長寓所張貼標語，　翻傢俱；交大學生擅自開動火車等等，均屬不守法律。</p>
<p>少數份子盜用名義</p>
<p>（三）全國各地之學潮中，均發生同一現象，即爲少數人盜用大衆之名義，例如交大全體學生數額爲三千人，而當天赴車站進備晉京請願者僅一千一百人，（此係日翌晨在車中付表決時所得之統計），顯見有一千九百人大多數學生反對赴京，而少數人竟擅用全體學生之名義行事，全屬不合情理。（四）綜上所列各點，顯見有人企圖利用學生作搗亂工具，可謂彰彰明甚。近日來不時有人強赴各校作公開演講，企園煽動他校罷課及罷市罷工，實已超越學生本身之要求。</p>
<p>吳市長復強調稱：全市四百萬市民所祈朮者爲安定，若罷市罷工一且實現，市民之損失何堪設想，市府處於此種情勢之下，不得不與警備司令部商得上項辦法，切實執行。該項辦法原係根據國家法令所擬定，凡反對者，即屬不民主，不能尊重他人之自由，顯干法紀。</p>
<p>市長表示四點願望</p>
<p>吳市長最後表示：渠有四點願望：（一）對於學生者－希望能以理智來解決問題，學生多數皆係純潔可愛，應有守法精神，作爲市民之表率，且爲眞民主之先鋒。（二）對於家長者－靑年之修養，家長應負重責，，應各自吿誠子弟，務必守法，平日並應注意子弟之一切行動。（三）對於社會者－凡好人皆怕事，愈怕事則事件之發生愈多，故希望社會人士能不怕事，凡犯罪者予以嚴厲檢舉，且誓作市府後盾。（四）對於野心家－靑年乃未來之主人翁，國家之至實，切勿利用靑年，作爲搗亂之工具。</p>
<h3>共黨圖煽動中小學罷課　軍警當局嚴予防範</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕共黨方面及其外圍份子，頃擬再度利用學生，今日起準備有所行動，同時更計劃煽動全市中小學生參加，以使事件益形擴大，並有強迫各校學生參加罷課遊行之事。本市當局已對此事加以一切必要之準備，萬一有所騷擾時，聞軍警當局決心爲千萬市民商店盡保護之責，並望工商界勿受其愚，自相驚擾。</p>
<p>又悉：市政當局鑒於此次學潮，其中不少學生係受人操縱所致，市長將於今日召集曰各該學生之家是訓話，希望渠等能約束子弟，安心就學，勿爲奸人所利用，招致無理之犧牲。如今後再有類似情事發生而甘蹈法網者，軍警當局決以擾亂治安之罪名，一律加以逮捕，不稍寬貸。</p>

<h3>絨綫繡成　麥帥巨像　我國各報代表　聯合致贈留念</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕我國各報代表，於本年二月下旬，應麥克阿瑟元帥之邀赴日訪間。在日期間，備受麥帥熱誠招待，故返國後，特向本市美一織藝廠定製絨綫繡成之麥帥巨像一幅，由各代表聯合致贈麥師，以資紀念並表謝忱。該巨像將由我國駐日代表團參謀傘兵少校錢明年專運赴日，日內即可啟程。</p>
<p>按該像高四十八吋，寬三十六吋。係美一織藝廠廠主石金虎設計，由劉佩珍女士領導其他數女工合繡而成，全部配以數十種顏色絨綫，鮮艷奪目，繡像歷一月餘完成，所耗絨綫達十磅，工程殊爲浩大。</p>
<p>是項美觀，新穎之藝術手工業，乃由石氏積六七年之研究，始具規模，出品以椅墊爲多。珍珠港事變前，由華運至國外，備受各國人士贊許，紛紛訂購，先後繡製羅斯福·史達林·邱吉爾·林有·華盛頓·及杜魯門總統等之像。現懸掛於首都國民大會堂與中央黨部之國父遺像及蔣主席肖像，均出自石氏及劉女士手藝　關於繡製過程，先由石氏將花樣及畫像用水彩顏色書於細方格紙上，然後由女工依照圖樣繡於細方格蔴布上，按格繡去，無或有誤，蓋每漏去一格或繡錯一格，即易致失真也。繡　像時，須先　目，鼻，口諸部，俟面部完工後，然後始繡其他部份。</p>
<p>美一織藝廠設於本市茂名南路（邁爾西愛路）四五七號，門市部設陝西南路（亞爾培路）九一一號。該廠現有女工二十餘人，值此夏令季節，該廠正從事繡製鞋面，每人每日約可繡二三雙，繡成後再交鞋匠製就，每變售價爲三萬八千元。</p>
<p>石氏等深感繡製　像，尚須精益求精，故目前仍悉心研究，計劃完成多幅精彩傑作，備出國展覽。同時，渠以本人資本有限，擴展頗不容易，故極盼社會人士共起設廠，以我展我國之新藝術手工柴。</p>
<p>附岡即係繡成之麥帥畫像，旁立者，自左至右爲：訪日團團員本報總編輯陳訓念，中國駐日代表團參謀傘兵少校錢明年，中央攝影塲記者范厚動，麥帥總部副官李曙曾，中華時報總編輯崔萬秋，東南日報記者宋越倫。</p>

<p>路局警務處日前破獲專賣黑市火車票之黃牛黨黨魁張阿財，據供稱，其黑票來源除由其黨徒向中國旅行社兩路營業所及火車站排隊擠得者外，並涉及中國旅行社職員吳某所供應等語。記者以黃牛黨續行，滬市行旅爲苦，爲明瞭各賣票機構取締黑票情形，特走訪路警處及中國旅行社負責人。據稱：該社成立二十餘年，向以服務行旅爲職資，對黃牛黨取締最力，經常每晨九時開門列隊售票·見有黃牛（每日必來購票者）擠入隊伍時，即由該社負責票務之吳君指認拉出，不准擠入。同時並由憲兵維持秩序，於抓到證據時，交由憲兵嚴辦。以故黃牛黨對吳君最爲恨毒，　向吳君恐嚇。此次黃牛黨魁張阿財被捕，舉咬吳君爲供應黑市票者，以爲報復洩忿。按張呵財曾供當日霄交中國旅行社吳某票款四百萬元云云。查該社每日經售之票子爲數不多，且最遠南京站之頭等對號車票，每張僅三萬元。若以四百萬元票款購買黑票，幾佔該社售出票款之半數，而每天應付旅客購票必有三四千人之譜，故事實上絕不可能云。但問或有少數黑票係由該社售出，則係由新黃牛所擠購，該社實防不勝防，並希望新聞界前往訪問，以明真相，並希望各界協助云。又據警務處息，日昨在張阿財身畔所抄出之黑市票五張，其號碼爲二二三六，二二四一，六一八六，六一六九，二等上海至無錫車票，均非由中國旅行社售出。</p>

<h3>本市專科以上校長　對學潮發表意見　盼學生速復課恢復秩序</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕上海市國立及私立專科以上學校校長，於昨日下午舉行集會，對此次學潮發表意見如下：最近本市專科以上學校學生，發動大規模之罷課運動，按其動機與主張，不無可以同情之處，然其所取之行動與態度，不免失於偏激。本會爲求事態之免於擴大，並覓取解決之途徑，俾學校得恢復融和肅穆之空氣，社會得保持安定正常之秩序，爰作如下之主張：（一）靑年之不能安心學業，國內未臻安定，實爲原因之一。政府旣已一再聲明，從未關閉和平之門，深望中共立即放下武器，開誠協商，庶人民痛苦不再加深，社會秩序得以恢復，然後教育方能循序進展。（二）增加教育經費，改善教師待遇，與學生伙食，本爲教育界之一致要求。惟出以罷課手段，則不僅失去維護教育之本意，反足招致更多之糾紛。故深望速行復課，恢復秩序。本會對於靑年合理之要求，願在政府財力可能之範圍內，盡力促進其逐步實現。（三）各校皆爲獨立機構，應保持其學府之尊嚴，校內學生有所表示，同應循合法之途徑，更不容受他校學生之干擾。近有甲校學生結隊衝入乙校，張貼標語，散發傳單等行動，本會不得不表示嚴正之譴責。（四）學生今日所戰求者，爲民主之實現，自應使每人得有充分發表其自己意志或主張之機會。決議果出於大多數之通過，少數者方能甘心接受，若舉行集會，不顧是否達到法定人數，或採取行動，不待多數贊同，甚至於集會之際，少數人鼓嗓呌　，不容與會者自由發表意見，則糾紛因此而起，且不免與民主眞義背道而馳矣。又近來谷校學生之間，常有號稱聯合之組織，其參加之代表是否由各該校全體學生所推舉，其所負之任務是否受全體學生之委託，往往不能證明。若未經合法手續而自稱代表，進而假藉名義，發號施令，是更與民主精神大相控謬矣。（五）關於學校制度或規程，應由學校根據教育法令施行，其中是否有需要更張之處，應由教育行政主管機關或學校斟酌決定，非學生所得輕率主張。此次風潮之起，本會同人事先未能作有效之疏解，深表歉疚。所望者，各校同學如能平心靜氣，求謀問題之解決，而不尚情感之爭，則亡羊補牢其猶未晚乎。</p>

<h3>國術列入全運錦標　京國術界函全運籌委會要求</h3>
<p>〔本報南京航訊〕南京國術界中央大學敎師朱國祥等五十餘人，為請將國術列入全運比賽事，致全運會籌委會函，略謂：「閱報載第七屆全國運動會第一次籌備會議，將國術一項列入表演，而不設錦標，此種決定，似欠妥善，查歷屆全國遝動會，曾將國術一項，列爲大會錦標之一，其中包括拳術·器械·摔角·射箭·彈丸·賜毽·及測力七項，七項之中，竊以國術爲我國民族體育最有意議，而有歷史性者，上屆大會時，並請蒙古代表到會表演摔角，極受一般人士之注意，同人等考慮再三，務請貴會將國術列入正式錦標之一。其理如左：（一）國術爲我國固有之運動，全國練習者異常管遍，其他國家對於固有之運動項目，無不極力提倡，本屆全運會竟將國術列入表演，顯與中央迭次宣示提倡國術之旨不合。（二）國術與其他體育項目同樣均有其競賽之意義，非但運動量大，並爲一種最能應用之生活技能，似宜積極提倡，以求普遍。（三）查乒乓一項，尚列入正式錦標，而對此固有之國術運動反列入表演項目，似欠公平云。</p>
<h3>本市國術界今開座談會</h3>
<p>第七屆全國運動會，將於本年雙十節舉行、本市國術界爲商討應否請求全運會增設國術錦標問題，及今後國衛運動之推進復興等問題，定今日下午七時半，假陝西南路市體育館會議室，舉行座談會，屆時國橋名家佟忠義·章啟東·唐璜·王亦樵·王懷琪等，均將出席商討。</p>

<h3>評征輪</h3>
<p>征輪在滬第五戰對恩卡斯，這一塲球賽預知必有可觀。因爲幾次此賽下來，對於征輪的優點，已經獲有確切的認識：長力，速率，和射籃準確</p>
<p>但是前兩個優點對恩卡斯，便佔不到便宜，因爲恩卡斯也有過人的體力與速度。昨夕征輪龍夠保持勝利，唯一的原因，就是投籃工夫超過恩卡斯·</p>
<p>征輸仍有無可掩飾的弱點：傳球技術尚須改善，籃下球的控制缺乏把握，尤其是在進攻敵籃時，一擲不中之後，球便落入恩卡斯之手。　屠文龍是征輸的重心，頭腦機警，射籃準確，更具天賦的體格。新人程飛，轉身靈活，也是一個有希望的人材。</p>
<p>我以爲征輪還有多少缺點，正是可喜的現象；氣力與速度是天賦，並不是優點，而籃球的基本技術，征輪除射籃以外，其餘尚未達純熱之境。我相信他們今後每戰一塲，仍可以「吸收」一場，竿頭日進。（昌年）</p>

<h3>力謀配合政府施策　四聯將辦實物貸款　張副主席首次出席理事會致詞</h3>
<p>〔聯合徵信所南京廿二日下午六時電）四聯總處理事會副主席一職，前奉國民政府命令現任行政院長張羣兼任，張氏於今日上午初次出席該處第三四四次理事會議，到會者有理事俞鴻鈞·張嘉　·翁文　·宋漢章·錢永銘·陳果夫·趙檢華·李叔明·霍賽　·陳行·龐松舟·譚伯羽·徐秘書長柏園·吳局長任滄·谷局長春帆·壽總經理勉成等。會議於九時開始，首由張氏致詞，略謂四聯總處主要業務爲聯合各行局力量，配合政府財政金融政策，以協助發展生產事業。抗戰期間，四聯貢獻甚多，今後應繼續努力，以適應復員建設之需要。張氏并就目前財政經濟金融情形作一概括之闡述，希望今後放款業務應選擲重點，採取主動，以謀更進一步酊合國策云云。嗣討論秘書處提出關於該處過去核辦放款情形及今後方針，各理事均先後發表意見，商討達二小時左右。按該處歷年來核辦各類放款，其範圍不出下列四項，</p>
<p>（一）與國家經建有關者，</p>
<p>（二）與社會民生有關者，·</p>
<p>（三）與推廣外交換取外匯有關者，</p>

<p>又江浙區春季絲繭貸款，前經核爲一千二百億元，茲以繭價增高，該處為協助完成本年度收兩繅絲計劃，經核准將上項貸款額，增加八百億元，速前共爲二千億元。</p>
<h3>掉期情況不利　永紗突告不瀉</h3>
<p>華股昨初俏繼痰，掉期情況不利，多方臨高有售，新買不繼，流言傳說不利於買方之空氣仍濃，永紗近午突吿下瀉，尤以即交永紗跌勢最慘，以致掉期愈拔愈開，永紗定二十五日開董事會，市上對增資傳說更多，且有述及永紗如果實行增資，是否暫停買買。傳廣帮堅主停止交易，而所方爲收入着想，有不予接受之謠。此舉對於軋空軋多，以及雜牌次熱前途，影響頗鉅。</p>
<p>晨初在掉期不利景況中見疲。但遞永紗不顧一切，開高至七五〇〇元。開後二一三號三一號一六九號一〇六號七六號脫售，曾將遞永紗迫低至七三七〇元。一四一號二〇五號二一八號七九號俱進，檯面奇涸，回升至七七三〇元。六一號一四八號一〇五號一六四號二二四號一五二號俱售，退至七五〇〇元內，二二三號一四號一四三號九四號一四八號一七號七八號來進，三五號六一號則進現永紗，盤高至七八〇〇元。一八〇號二二四號七八號脫手，降爲七六五〇元。一〇六號一五五號進胃尚健，升至七八五〇元。一五三號八九號三二號六五五號八三號一二號來賣，十一時半後，漸形不支，二四號二二三號三六號亦賣，十一時五十分步降至七三五〇元。一五五號六五號二三二號一四號二一八號三六號進至七六〇〇元外，此後即每況愈下，謠言利買，七六號一九七號八九號一五三號二二三號一六〇號二三五號紛紛脫手，散多急售，八三號並斬即永紗，午後將遞永紗迫低至七〇五〇元。一四一號等略進，午收升爲七一二〇元，收後恍惚，美亞永公曾吿跌停，結果較前收計永紗新光勤興各跌半成強，景福信和新華永公跌一成強，美亞跌停。遞交計前日祗半天交易，是以永紗微挫，勤興小漲，信和新光景福跌半成強，美亞永公跌一成，冷股計中法國貨漲停，中紡統益中絲火柴水泥跌一成左右，大通跌成半，除均下降半成左右。塲外各老股計閘北升一成，世界跌一成，餘股升降不一。</p>
<p>現遞套利交易，昨金融帮果減少額子，但大多頭貼出者亦祗八九號而已。成交並不暢旺，永紗以四五〇元開市，低至四〇〇元，而後步昂至五六〇元，而以五五〇元收市。美亞二千二開市，自二千元拉上至二千五結束，信和自二八〇元退至二二〇元，而以二六〇元結束。小型股自十元至十三元，合息價自二角二至三角二不等。</p>
<h3>公債平庸　外股恍惚</h3>
<p>公債昨平庸而稍疲，統丁尚形穩定，成交祗四百餘萬。統丙晨開一四五〇〇元，低至一三八〇〇元，而後見定。五五〇室三六〇室有售，結果較前收計甲乙跌六百元，丙降八百元，統丁尚平，統戊亦挫三百元。</p>
<p>外股昨亦恍惚，各股升降俱微，廣帮吸納小型股，外商則扒英聯。證券帮賣意不怠，過程遂鮮起色。結果較前收計怡啤紙業微升，會德豐　植尚平，怡紗航業跌半成左右，餘股咸跌落少許。</p>
<h3>人造絲喊高　廠經綢貨下游</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲因中信局配售絲織業，延長至週末繳款，塲內籌碼甚枯，人心轉堅。一二〇號高山有光一千七百萬元開盤，升十萬元收盤。下午喊價又高十萬元，最後爲一千七百二十萬元，較上日大三十萬元。東洋及金三馬等同時跟升，七五號半光乏人過問，昨市仍喊上日原盤。　昨市廠經因綢廠帮需胃甚薄，形成供求不均之局面，喊價繼續下游。Ａ字等級成交價爲二千〇七十萬元，Ｃ字等級做開二千〇二十萬元，Ｅ字等級一千九百五十萬元，俱比上日短三十萬元之譜，成交數量極微。干經乏人過問，喊價無甚上落。</p>
<p>昨市綢貸除價絲被面及格子璧縐稍短外，餘皆平定。美亞被面喊八百六十萬元，比上日小十萬元，並無成交。大誠格子豐趨先做三萬一千七百元，後因多方出籠，喊價漸低，最後爲一千三百元賣出。隔日期喊一千六百元，結果較上日短去七百元。</p>
<h3>綢緞運印</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：絲織聯營公司所產之外銷綢緞約二萬餘疋，業己份三批運印，刻全部已報關入口。前傳印度擬在本年六月底後，禁止國外絲綢入口，此事現正由我外交部，訓令我駐印使節從詳調查中。聞美國對印度此舉，亦表不能同意。果所傳屬實，則將循外交途徑，謀取合理解決辦法云。</p>
<h3>棉紗轉趨堅挺</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市況轉趨堅挺，良以各貨取銷限制紗布流通之呼聲甚盛，如一旦可能取銷，則紗價有上揚之望，是以人心轉佳，塲中亦略有補納。四二支藍　初開爲一千一百八十萬元，旋即步升，至最後爲一千二百十萬元，比上日升二十萬元。廿支特雙馬爲七百十五萬元，軋升廿五萬元。雙馬紗由六百六十五萬元至收市爲七十萬元，亦漲一二十萬元。其餘各紗，俱較上日漲自五萬元至二三十萬元不一云。</p>
<h3>夏貨棉布見俏</h3>
<p>棉布市況，因前日市傳華北有限制流動之說，致客帮咸抱觀望，本街吸納亦懈。故十二磅龍頭細布會步小至廿八萬八九元，尚少受主。嗣以業中人認爲華北限制消息不實，而反傳有最銷之呼聲甚高，塲中人心突趨穩固，本衛對夏令布疋均有購進，結果各橋漂布回升四五千元。龍頭細布漲二千元爲廿九萬五千元，跳　嗶嘰及元貢緞等軋升，其他士林布則回低一萬元許。籃布軋落自一萬元至二萬五千元，粗布細布府綢等大多見降云。</p>
<h3>皂燭原料回落　燒堿猛挫六十萬</h3>
<p>昨日皂燭原料因香港有到貨，兼之洋行拋吐，行市步步軋低。月牌燒碱跌至七百萬元，猛瀉六十萬元，美貨亦見跟小爲六百九十萬元。泡化碱每磅自二千元跌至一千八百元，司的令亦小二十萬元爲三百萬元。其餘椰子油及香草松香白臘等價尚平穩。</p>
<h3>祥茂派貨</h3>
<p>中國肥皂公司，前派銷ＭＣ．ＭＯ兩級同行黃白祥茂肥皂，該公司規定繳納貨款日期，本係廿一日截止。茲爲各同行此次每戶須繳貨款現鈔八十二萬元，致檢點鈔票手續頗慢，未及繳款同行尚馬不少。現該公可特將繳款限期，展延至明日（星期六）截止，繳淸貨款，俾辦領貨手續。</p>
<h3>食米到貨較稀　市勢續見挺升　高白粳昨做卅四萬元新價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市昨到貨較少，共計六三八四石。米商納胃頗佳，去路活躍，市勢續往上挺，又較上日漲起一二萬元。高貨白粳南市做卅三萬五千元，北市做卅四萬新高價。　又一部份米商前已繳教，向社會局領配之暹暹米，已於日昨出貨。其中十分之四爲碎米，常與好米摻和後，於日內分別在各區出售。</p>
<p>又訊：麵粉因內地續跌，隨之不振，再挫二三千元。麩皮廠方照常供應，實銷動而不吒，價無軒輊。豆餅東北續到，鄉銷略動，市形定局。黃豆依然平站，箓豆顧主甚少，步跌三五千元。紅糧續挺二三千元，赤豆另化有動，回漲三四千元。生仁彷彿，芝蔴津莊有去路，轉昂三五千　·蠶豆出新時期不日到申，形趨軟化。苞米北洋幫仍在猛力收　，繼續飛騰一萬五六千元。</p>
<p>油市各路均有到貨，消化清閒，豆油猛跌二三萬元，淸油續跌二萬元，生油亦挫萬餘元。蔴油步跌一二萬元，菜油再低萬元。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕食米大量到滬，福來輪船公司代理之菲輸喀塞勃克尼號，昨晨抵埠，由暹邏運來米四萬餘包，現泊四號五號浮筒起卸。</p>
<h3>秘魯砂議價　定四十三萬元</h3>
<p>本市各倉庫所存之秘魯砂糖，爲數頗鉅。糖業公會爲避免流入黑市起見，乃決遵照社會局命令，辦理登記手續，並代擬就成本計算表，送呈社會局，提交昨日物價評議委員會食糖小組會議中討論。業經議定價格爲每一百磅四十三萬元，並以現貨交易爲進準。能以棧單轉讓者，則照例退減。但應儘量供應，全數向市塲銷售，嚴禁囤積居奇。</p>
<h3>五金市況</h3>
<p>昨五金又吿呆滯，洋釘稍降，實銷平平，各種貨品均欲漲無力。</p>
<h3>華南特設輸管委會　防止走私統制貿易</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸入臨時管理委員會執委會，於五月廿一日舉行第卅二次例會，廈門區辦事處許處長鳳藻，來滬出席報吿當地執行管理轍入情況，茲探悉該區提出討論事項經議決如次：</p>
<p>（甲）廈門區進口貨第二季限額之分酊，由許處長與分配處及非限額審核處洽辦。</p>
<p>（乙）福廈商會函請按照廣汕習例，簽發臨時許可證，並准結匯，議決：華南區旣已規定限額，應即按照貿易條例辦理，不再簽發臨時許可證。</p>
<p>（丙）華僑捐助廈區學校社團機關物品之輸入，議決：應照本會第二十三次會議決定辦法辦理。　此外執委會議決聘請林繼庸氏，爲該會顧間，並追認通過下列兩案：</p>
<p>（一）輸廣會提議以華南走私猖獗，危機重疊，應設立華南輸出入管理委員會，統籌辦理進出口貿易事宜案。</p>
<p>（二）輸廣會提議輸出品之製造原料輸入辦法草案案。聞上列兩案，已由張主任委員呈請全國經濟委員會核批云云。</p>
<h3>美金公債基金　將存放紐約中行　短期庫券擔保品已擬定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕卅六年美金價券基金監理委員會主任委員李　蓀氏，頃就短期庫券及美金公價之基金及担保品等間題，對記者發喪談話如次：</p>
<p>（一）（問）短期庫券基金担保品已否決定，估價情形如何？（簽）此項擔保品之指定，前經財部遵行政院令，邀集經濟部資委會，敵偽產業處理局，及債券基金監理委員會代表，舉行會談，日決議擬定紡建，中蠶，中菸，水產，各公司，德孚洋行，拜耳　廠，敵偽倉庫碼頭，敵儘房地產等八單位，及經濟部之其他事業投資股份，估價完竣，即由部呈請政府指定公吿。</p>
<p>（二）（問）美金公償之基金已否發下，存於何處？（答）美金公債基金存放機關，依照監理會組織規程，應由監理會指定，現因此項指定，宜不受「公庫法」限制一點，正在呈請政府核定，俟此點核定後，當即由監理會正式指定存放處所。並即可由中央銀行依照條例，將第一期本息，照數撥交監理會。其存放處所，大約爲紐約中國銀行，</p>
<p>（三）（問）優利短期庫券何時可以發行？（答）鄙人於本月上旬赴漢，昨日始回上海，優利短期庫券之發行，僅見各報所載之消息與議論，此外未有所聞。截至現在爲止，似尚係一種建議。此事於整個金融關係頗大，鄙意須鄭重研究，　權利害，而不宜輕於當試。</p>
<h3>捲烟市勢轉秀</h3>
<p>昨日香烟市勢轉趨挺秀，塲中頤中公司之烟走銷甚暢，同業添辦頻起，喊價更見俏利。華商烟走勢平常，晨關大英牌自七百四十萬喊開，旋即一路盤升至七百七十萬元高價。老刀由六百六十五萬元，亦步升至六百七十萬以上。關因外埠同業見高拋售，市面稍形回小。</p>
<p>午收時，大英烟在七百五十萬元站立，老刀六百六十八萬元有供售，午後微有護利吐出，致大英烟回小二十萬元，結果爲七百三十萬元，比上日軋升一萬元。老刀爲六百六十七萬五千元，軋升四萬五千元，其餘華商烟則互有上落。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕昨日聽頭香烟脚地依然堅硬，茄力克五萬五千五百元至六千元間，均有成交。五十支三砲合更形挺俏，聞三萬二千元之價尚難吸進。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕美麗牌香烟在上午九時前喊價，每條在四萬元關口徘徊。迨至九時半許，因華成烟草公司派貨通吿貼出，配給美麗牌香烟，計甲卡兩箱，乙卡一箱，丙卡四十條，每箱派價爲三百八十萬元。斯時塲中頗多供售，惟吃戶則須四萬進關，似在三萬七八干元始有進意云。</p>
<h3>商會及工協代表商討　原料限額分配問題　議決妥愼簽證辦法兩項</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市商會及工業協會爲討論第一期限額輸入工業原料問題，特於昨日下午三時，在市商會召集本市各工業同業公會代表談話。出席各業代表三四十人，由潘士浩主席，討論至六時許散會。茲將經過各情，探誌大要</p>
<p>（甲）報吿事項：關於工業原料問題，曾於本月五日召集第一次談話會，議決辦法五項。</p>
<p>（乙）討論事項：（一）一月底前之核准輸入原料簽證事項，已經決定三項辦法，通吿各公會遵照辦理。惟第一期限額輸入工業原料，輸管會即將開始分配，關於此後公會方面，應如何統籌妥慎簽證辦法，以杜流弊，應請討論公決。</p>
<p>議決：即日起，對於各工廠需用原料，其在本年一月三十日以前，已向輸管會申請，或與進口商簽訂購買合約，而獲核准輸入之定貨，一律准予證明。但於簽證時，必先賣成會員廠商，提供證件，具結遵守下列二項：（一）將來公會辦理整個限額分配時，上項數額，於其第一期應得分配額中扣除之。（二）定貨數量如有超過規定數量三個月生產能力時，其超過數量，得由公會分配予全體同業。</p>
<h3>政府收購出口貨　為目前合理辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據某出口界人士談：因各國物價波動過去劇烈，國內外價格相去太遠，故出口業已陷於停頓。以出口大宗之桐油而論，國內價格較國際價格至少高出五成。故由政府權構收購出口物資，統一外銷，其損失由國庫負担，在目前爲合理之辦法。</p>
<h3>承辦日賠償工廠　商聯會推定代表</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國商聯會參加承辦日本賠償工廠代表，依上次議案推定八人，人選爲王曉籟（上海市），傅汝霖（上海），金潤庠（上海），葛傑臣（上海）王　齋（南京），陸小波（江蘇），朱惠淸（浙江），孫元甫（安徽）。工商輔導處定今日開會續商承辦事宜，並希望工協及商會各地人選名單，早日提出。</p>
<h3>經港出口衰落</h3>
<p>〔中央社香港廿二日電〕閩台茶經港出口，日趨衰落。戰前自港輪入華茶之暹越，馬來亞，荷印，等地，戰後人民購買力弱，多用較廉之土茶。戰前經港運銷越南華茶數量，年約十餘萬件，去年僅二千件。最近茶價較去年低跌，普通包茶由四百餘元跌至一百一十元，閩北武夷茶大岩水仙由二千餘元跌至一千八百元，台灣ＢＯＰ紅茶由三百九十元跌至一百三十元，惟安溪鐵觀音價穩，仍售一千二百元。</p>
<h3>外銷平水　已在籌製</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市：仍因吐納各處喊價，未能趨近，故市勢依然沉寂。據業中人云：向受美洲歡迎之平水大帮，本年度新茶，產區已在籌製中。惟聞成本相當昂貴，每担須在百萬元外，照此價格恐難合國外胃口，是以出口或未許樂觀。至各種內銷茶，過程並不呆頓，各檔行情屹立。但卅五年度徵州烘靑，受貨爲關係，市氣急遽進展，堪稱獨樹一幟。</p>
<h3>英鎊滙率波動</h3>
<p>官價四元市塲二元半</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿一日電〕外界盛傳美國將以新貨款界予英國，雖經英美兩國官方否認，但此說依舊甚囂　上。因此英鎊對美元之匯率，亦發生波動，官價匯率爲四美元對一英鎊，但華爾街之金鎊證券賣買，英匯市價爲二元五角。</p>
<h3>皮革回降</h3>

<h3>葡萄糖鈣與維生素丙　混用之商榷</h3>
<p>— 汪企張</p>
<p>讀本刊第四期宋國賓氏，對本問題之檢討，與第十期沈松年氏對檢討之懷疑，皆有考據淵源，獨得見地，使人心析。不佞囿於知見，就歷來一得，略盡貢獻之忱，是否有當，還望宋沈兩公，益而敎之。</p>
<p>吾人體內，化學分合之複雜，決非現代學力所得洞見其底蘊，所謂人體不能搬入研究窒，正是吾人眼前之一個悶胡蘆，本問題未能澈底解決之前提，即由於此。鈣療法之有利結核，與結核症之缺乏鈣素，已有數十年之歷史，迄今在學術上，仍占有力階段，第應用上，多主不經口，而避免消化器中複雜變化，乃普及注射法，尤以靜脈內注射，爲一般目標。惟鈣療法之第一要件，爲必使鈣成溶解性液，第二要件，爲極力滅少刺激，避免溶血作用。近三十年中，應各種治撩目的，而用於靜脈注射之品，幾經改進，爲數甚多，就不佞平日所知，而應用最煩者，厥爲下列各品。</p>
<p>氯化鈣Calcium　chlorat</p>
<p>乳酸鈣Calc.lact</p>
<p>安息香酸鈣Calc.benzoce</p>
<p>碘鈣Calc.godat</p>
<p>鈣Calc.bromat</p>
<p>撒酸鈣Calc.salicylie</p>
<p>葡萄糖酸鈣Calc.gluconat</p>
<p>乳糖酸鈣Calc.glucono-galacto-gluconate　or　calc　lacto-bionate</p>
<p>以及此外單純，或混合製品甚多，要以澄淸無色之溶液，爲其重要目標。但體內病灶部，所需之鈣，則主在不溶解物，足知配以各種酸基，使成溶解性之鈣，爲便入血中，利於轍送，及避免血栓，而其終結所需，仍是不溶解性之鈣塊而已，是不啻科學家之故弄玄虛也。</p>
<p>不佞就三十年中，對屍體中組織內，及病人偶然喀出之鈣塊，加以化學的研究，確認主成分爲炭酸鈣，間或有燐之痕跡，爲一種鈣鹽，而並非一般腦中所認單純之鈣質，其理甚明。以是知，無論何種鈣劑，注入體內，經各組織時，受幾何階段之酸化作用，乃放棄原有之酸基，而與炭酸化合，形成不溶解性炭駿鈣塊，可無疑義。且惟恐其不酸化，不起化學作用，保存原有之溶解性狀，而自體洩出也。第在體內，在何機構（或即病灶部），炭酸與其他酸基交換情形，及階段，或起於漸，或成於驟，淺學如予，未敢知也。</p>
<p>按宋氏之禁酸說，可分作兩節檢討，如僅限於胃，即經口的，則胃液本屬酸性，萬一所用爲弱酸基，或造鹽素屬Halogen　group中之碘　等鈣，以親和力關係，即大有變成氯化鈣之可能，然氯化鈣，本爲一溶解之中性鹽，如入腸遇鹼性而不起任何變化時，仍能吸收，仍得達鈣療法之目的，初不需酒，醇，啤酒，醋，咖啡，檀檬，橘子，蘋果，番茄，菠萊等原含酸質，或因激泌胃酸，而始變化原來鈣劑之構造也。其次爲不經口之注射鈣，入血中如何起變化問題，似有關血中酸度者甚大，惟生理上，血之酸度，例有範圍，萬一因某種疾病，或新陳代謝異常，而使血中酸度踰常時，吾人即認爲酸血症Acidosis，即非普通之生理現象也。故檸檬酸，醋酸，或酒石酸等，與銬之結合品，吾人固無經騐，而抗壞血病酸AscorbieAsid鈣，亦未之前聞，且徵之注射筒中，葡萄糖酸鈣，與抗壞血病酸混合後，不起任何化學變化情形，足證葡萄糖駿，與鈣之親和力，決不示弱於抗壞血病酸，彰彰甚明。</p>
<p>其次，為人體內鈣之需要量問題，常令人有過與不及之感想，惟血中含鈣量，貴有一定限度，而每人需要，則因種種情形而異，譬如佝僂及肺病人，或孕婦等，似常嫌鈣之缺乏，而老人及梅毒等有損血管之疾病者，反有鈣量過多之慮，回憶不佞在學時，病理敎授片瀨氏，曾就體內組織中，鈣之結塊問題，頗加以研死，所發表之報告及論文甚多，關於此項文獻，惜在抗戰期中，完全紛失，惟記其大意，謂就　兒，日以多量之鈣，注入血中，經一定時日，而檢其血中鈣量，並全身組織中之鈣塊，結果，毫無異常之發見，惟尿中鈣之排出量增加而已。又再就先加損其血管－或體組織一部之家兎，而同樣注鈣於其血中，亦經一定時日，而加以檢騐，除血中之含鈣量，仍維原狀外，血管及組織之加損部，皆有鈣塊可證。以是知吾人體之血中，含鈣量，常有一定（該報吿中記有一時鈣量增多現象惟概在注射鈣劑後即檢原因）之平衡狀態，即使多量之鈣，循環健全組織，亦無沈滯結塊等事發生，而將不需要之鈣，排出體外，祇血管及組織之損壤受病處，始有鈣塊之附着。至宋氏對梅毒，酒毒及年邁者，不需多鈣，甚或因鈣而誘發他病一層，則與不佞管見，完全一致。</p>
<p>鄙意宋沈兩氏，以過慮與懷疑兩點，對葡萄糖酸鈣，與抗壞血病酸混用，有所論列，完全垠據學者態度，旣無可非議，亦不敢批評，惟就過去所知，加以綜核而觀察，以爲鈣劑在消化器中之變性，與血液內之分鮮，乃必然之勢，即葡萄糖酸鈣，在胃腸內吸收時，是否仍保原構造，以及在血中周流時，是否仍保原構造，在未能證實以前，自難輕加判斷。惟葡萄糖酸，以及其他酸藝結合之鈣，無論其在胃腸，在血液，或在體組織內，要達成治療目的之前，不得不變性，不得不分解，而使成不溶解性之鈣塊，則可斷言也，質之兩氏，以為如伺。</p>
<h3>嬰兒營養</h3>
<p>— 江楊敏閑　周德勤</p>
<p>一個人體格之健康，不外受兩種影賽：一是先天的遺傳，一是後天的環境。我們姑且不論遺傳，　拿環境來說，　影響健康的因素，雖然不勝枚舉，但是營養問題，却非常重要，因爲人體各種組織的材料，及各種活動力量的來源，都要依賴食物。嬰兒時期是一生的基礎，爲培養良好基礙，自然不能忽視了嬰兒時期的食物。</p>
<p>按原則上來說，嬰兒與成人之營養需要，並沒有很大的差別，其不同之點只是嬰兒消化器官尙未發育成熟，所以消化功能比成人薄弱。同時嬰兒生長及發育極其迅速，所以嬰兒食物除須供給活動及身體各部之修補以外，還需剩餘以供生長及發育之用，所以嬰兒的需要，按體重比例來說，較成人爲多。最適宜的食物</p>
<p>母乳：最適宜的食物</p>
<p>嬰兒自出生以後，至一歲爲止，最適宜的食物，莫過於母乳。母乳較其他食品有下列重要的優點：（一）母乳成分隨嬰兒發育而改變。產婦於產後一二日內所分泌色黃而稀之乳汁，可使嬰兒吸吮，以刺激乳汁之分泌。十二日以內的乳汁含脂肪較少，蛋白質較多。一個月內的乳汁脂肪及蛋白質均甚豐富。但從一個月後到九個月之乳汁脂肪及蛋白質漸漸稀薄。九個月後則更甚。所以喂哺母乳者，在八九個月後應有補充食品，以補充乳汁中營養素的不足。（二）喂哺母乳無需運轍調製等手續，可减少細菌感染的機會。結核病，傷寒，痢疾，霍亂等病菌，常可從牛乳中傳染。（三）嬰兒吸吮動作有利於嬰兒口腔發育；同時哺乳能助母親之子宮恢復原狀，（四）母乳最經濟且又便利。所以嬰兒，在可能範圍內，應由母哺乳，若身患結核病，肺炎，奶　，瘋癲，花柳等症，或其他慢性疾病時，則不得不停止授乳。若母親患急性傳染病，如痢疾，猩紅熱等可暫時停止授乳，每日用壓乳器擠出乳汁，以免乳汁停止分泌。病愈後，仍可繼續授乳，若乳汁不足時寧可於母乳外，另加他種補充食品，切不可驟然斷乳，若母親不能授乳而欲僱用乳母時，選擇乳母必須注意下列數點：（一）須檢騐乳母的身體，乳母必須爲健康無傳染病者，（二）乳母之乳質與量應適合於嬰兒的需要，如晚期乳母乳汁稀薄，不合於早期嬰兒的需要。性質及其分析</p>
<p>代乳品性質及其分析</p>
<p>人工哺乳多以鮮牛乳，羊乳，蒸發乳，乳粉及特製豆漿爲嬰兒之食品。茲將各種代乳品分述如下：</p>
<p>（Ａ）鮮牛乳鮮牛乳所含之蛋白質量比人乳多，但乳白蛋白質（Lactalalbumin）量較少，不易消化之乳酪素（Casein）佔十之八九，且牛乳之蛋白質在胃中凝結後形成之乳塊，比人乳者稍粗而不易消化．牛乳所含的炭水化物比人乳中爲少。其礦物質量較人乳多，但銅鐵成分反較人乳爲少，所以使用鮮牛乳時必須加以調製，方能爲嬰兒合宜之食物，其調製法如下：（一）煮沸三分鐘，使蛋白質易於消化，並有消毒作用。（二）加糖以增高炭水化物含量。牛乳每百公分，加糖五克，蔗糖或麥芽糖（糖稀）均可，第七個月時糖可减少。九個月時，可以不再加糖，因此時嬰兒已可吃他種炭水化物之食物。大便稀的嬰兒，應當少加糖大便硬的可多加。（三）加水以冲淡蛋白質</p>
<p>（Ｂ）全乳粉此係將牛乳除去水份而製成者，若每一容量加水四容量，其成分即與鮮牛奶相同，可按鮮牛奶的調製法以得適宜牛奶。</p>
<p>（Ｃ）蒸發乳　此係將牛奶蒸發，水份减至一半者。芳加一倍水，其成分則與鮮乳相同。</p>
<p>（Ｄ）羊乳蛋白質及炭水化物與牛乳相同，僅脂肪略高，但脂肪球小易消化，且羊乳無結核症傳染之可能，羊乳可用以哺育弱嬰，或對牛乳有過敏性反應者。</p>
<p>（Ｅ）代乳豆漿　牛羊乳在中國產量不足，無法購買者可用豆漿代替之。普通豆漿及炒豆漿均須加食鹽，乳駿鈣，澱粉，糖以補充其成分而用以代乳，因豆漿中之無機豐，炭水化物之含量均甚低。黃豆炒後，容易磨碎，蛋白質加以改變，易於消化，所以炒豆漿合於嬰兒之用。食代乳豆漿者，須盒白菜水，以補維生素丙不足，魚肝油以補脂肪及維生素甲，下之不足。二，三月時應加　蛋黃，以增蛋白質及鐵。</p>
<p>普通代乳豆漿作法　將一份重量之黃豆加八分重量之水浸泡一夜，用石磨磨成漿狀，用消毒過之布袋　之·每二市斤豆漿加澱粉廿公分，糖四十公分，骨粉二公分，鹽一公分，煮沸廿分鐘。煮時隨時攪動，以免結塊或燒焦。</p>
<p>b炒豆漿作法將砂子倒於鍋內炒熱，等砂子熱後，再將黃豆倒於鍋內，使豆與砂子合在一起，用鐵鏟時時攪勻，黃豆炒至有爆響，且呈淺褐色時即可（需時的一刻鐘左右）。將黃豆砂子倒在節內將砂篩凈，俟黃豆冲後再磨；過　後，所餘的渣再置於磨上磨之。如是反覆磨四次，至全部之黃豆俱成極細的粉即可。將豆粉（五十克）白糖（廿克）澱粉（十克）鹽（半克）骨粉（一克）及溫水合在一起，調勻後，再加水至一磅容積。後把混合物置於火上煮沸，俟煮開後再放在微火上煮一小時。煮漿時，須用木鏟時攪勻，以免煮焦。</p>
<p>人工哺乳除注重代乳品成分外，應注意淸潔問題，以光沾染細菌，各種食品如乳，永，糖等，以及各角具如乳瓶量乳杯，羹匙等均須保持淸潔。每次用後，應沒入淸水中，使廢物易於流凈，然後再放入淸水中煮沸。乳頭用鉗子置入沸水洗過之大口瓶內。乳瓶留於沸水鍋中，或放於沸水洗過的盤上，覆以淸潔之布。一切物件從沸水中取出後，不得與手指或其他未消毒物件接觸。調製後之乳，可先放入冰箱中，用時將瓶放入溫水鍋內溫熱。</p>
<p>母乳乳量不足，可參用其他代乳品。因母乳營養價値較高，所以應先哺盡母乳，不足之量由其他代乳品補足。</p>
<p>哺乳量多於或少於嬰兒的需要量，均易引起疾病。若無嘔吐腹瀉或其他不適現象，且要兒體重增加正常，則表示乳量正常。若生長欠佳，或爲乳量不足之表示。嬰兒需要乳量隨年齡，體重，個人而有差異哺喂母乳者，每磅體重需乳二唡。人工哺乳者，最好應請醫師指示。茲將每日每磅體重所需牛奶及糖量列表如下，以供參考。</p>
<h3>結婚健康診斷書</h3>
<p>— 謝筠壽</p>
<p>古人以夫婦爲人倫的起點，吾人現在來談民族的生存和發展，自然也要以夫婦爲開始；倘使雨性相接合的夫婦，如果一方面有病態的話，那就要互相傳染，或則遣傳給子孫，產生不健全的種子。不健全的種子，是民族絕沒的一個重大因素。例如品斯俾氏的記載，一家精神病家屬的第一代，是一個狂飮荒淫者；第二代是癲癎，憂鬱症，臟躁病，舞蹈病者；第三代是誇大狂，憂鬱病者；第四代是誇大狂，色情狂，低能者，白癡；到了第五代就全族滅亡。吾人看了這樣的記載，自然要不寒而慄。爲防患未然計，爲未雨綢繆計，對於夫婦的結合，應當兩方面健康，眞是天經地義的事情。</p>
<p>謀兩性的健康，當然有種種限制結婚的條件，例如美國對於結婚限制的理由是這樣的：第一爲精神病，次之爲白痴，再次之爲痴鈍，精神薄弱，癲癎，花柳病，受人賬恤者，酒癖，肺癆，傳染病，常常犯罪者。以上的幾種很制結婚理由，各洲的採取方法有不同，有的採擇一種，有的採擇數種，吾們現在採擇最重要而且容易實行的，先來試行一下，就是兩種重大的國民病……性病和結核。</p>
<p>先來討論性病嗎！一個男子，討得如花美眷；一個女子，嫁了得意郞君；眞是郞才女貌，是何等可喜可賀的樂事。可是不幸得很，在蜜月中僅僅過了幾天的快樂，因爲染着性病的關係，發生了淋病呀，梅毒呀，軟性下疳呀，弄得如花如玉的新娘，懨懨無生氣；新郞呢！也有難言之　，使一個充滿喜氣的小家庭，頓時間變成了愁雲籠罩的地獄，這樣痛苦的情形，非身歷其境的人們，恐難以理會。吾現在再把性病的禍害，來簡單的說明一下。</p>
<p>傳染淋病以後，男的方面，除了小便疼痛，膿汁淋漓等局部痛苦以外，最重要的就是發生淋毒性睪丸炎，引起不妊症。女子方面，除了尿道淋病以外，還可以上升到子宮，喇叭管，引起不妊。女子不妊症半數以上，可以歸因到淋病。至於子宮淋病時候的月經過多，白帶淋漓，經來腹痛，也是終身够受的痛苦。</p>
<p>梅毒呢！男女二方，除了發生硬性下疳，梅毒疹，筋骨酸痛，內臟梅毒等種種痛苦以外，最重要的，就是傳染到子孫，發生先天梅毒。流產早產，尤爲梅毒的最甫要現象，醫學上遇到常常流產的締人，大多是有梅毒的可疑。還有梅毒和精神病是有連帶關係的，據統計上精神病的三分之一，是由梅毒而來的。</p>
<p>性病除了梅毒淋病以外，還有軟性下疳和鼠蹊淋巴內腺芽腫，雖然沒有淋病和梅毒那樣的重要，患了以後，也可以使你身體上受到嚴重的痛苦。依照上面所講，吾們知道性病的害毒，不是個人的事情，是可以傳染到對方，而且還可以影響到子孫，使之斷種絕代，在民族生存和發展上講起來，眞是一個自然淘汰的重要因素。還有因梅毒發生精神病的話，對於家庭，對於社會，對於國家，都是一個不安寗的因素。此外因性病而發生的時間和經濟的損失，眞是國家的一筆重大損失呢！</p>
<p>第二是結核，結核是一種慢性傳染病，尤以在夫妻間更容易傳染，夫妻間傳染了以後，還可以把結核體質遺傳到子孫，就是結核夫妻所產生的子女，容易發生結核。加以國民種住知識的幼稚，對於結核菌的傳染，大多不知道注意，不知不覺地子孫也發生結核病，于是沒有達到中年期，大多夭亡，談風水的人，就鼓其如簧之舌，某家墳墓風水不好，代代單丁，某家房屋方向不吉，不留子孫；其實何常是墳基房屋的關係還不是結核菌的作祟嗎！</p>
<p>所以我們要創造健康的家庭，保特民族的繁榮，非在兩性結婚以前，大家提出一種健康診斷書，證明雙方的健康不可。這張診斷書，或許比較學問，地位，財產，美貌等等，來得更重要呢！</p>
<p>要兒每磅體重需流質二兩，，除去牛乳總量，則可得水量　兒之食量及需要，往往因人而異，故上列之量，應斟酌情形而稍增减。</p>
<p>產後十二小時內不必喂哺嬰兒，每二小時喂水少許（可用百分之五葡萄糖或蔗糖溶液）。乳汁分泌後視嬰兒强弱，每隔三小時或四小時授乳一次。以上午二時，六時，十時，下午二時，六時，十時最合適。至二個月時，可減上午二時之一次，九個月後下午十時亦可停止。瘦弱嬰兒每次吸吮無幾，在三四月前可每三小時授乳一次。兩次授乳之間喂以溫沸水，以上午八時，十二時，下午四時，八時爲合宜。初生第一星期每次可喂水一唡，第二星期每次喂一唡半，以後每月每次加半唡，八個月以上每次喂四喃。飲水可用菓汁或菜汁代替之。哺喂母乳時間不宜太長，最好約廿分鐘。時間過長，嬰兒有吸入空氣而致胃脹及食慾减少之弊。若嬰兒吸吮力不足時，吸吮數分鐘後，可將乳擠出以奶瓶喂哺　。嬰兒在哺乳時應避免睡賬。人工哺乳速度不應太快，乳頭大小應合適將乳瓶倒立，隔三英吋流一滴即可）。哺乳時母親與嬰兒一不應受任何騷擾。每次哺乳後應一將嬰兒豎抱。使其頭伏於大人肩上，經拍背部，使空氣由口中呼出。</p>
<p>母乳或牛乳中之營養素均有缺乏，故自然哺乳或人工哺乳都需要含礦物質和維生素豐富之食物以補充，同時加食補養物可减少以後斷乳之困難，故而作爲斷乳之準備。現將補充食物分述如下：</p>
<p>（Ａ）菓汁或菜汁：人工哺乳嬰兒於一個月內，母乳哺喂者於三個月後，須開始添加橘燈汁等富含維生素丙之食物，每日喂二次，每次一匙或二匙，漸增至一兩或二兩。如橘橙計不合用，可用柚或西紅柿，蘿卜，藕，白菜或各種靑菜汁代替。太酸時可加糖。蔬菜中丙種維生素量較橙少，所以量須較橘汁增加。西紅柿汁量應較橙汁加倍，白菜水分量應三倍。</p>
<p>維生素丙易爲高熱所損壞，各物消毒時間不可過長。熱度不可過高。同時最好隨做隨食，以免維生素丙之損失。</p>
<p>a鮮橘汁作法：水菓及擠器皆須消毒，切或大塊，置於擠器中旋轉數次，菓汁流入濾器，加等量闵開水即可。</p>
<p>b西紅柿汁作法：將西紅柿洗凈法放入熟蒸籠中蒸十分鐘，再放入消毒紗布袋內擠出。加入等量溫開水即可。</p>
<p>c蘿卜汁作法：將蘿卜洗凈後，與用具同浸入沸水中消毒，蘿卜用創擦成絲，置於紗布袋中擠出汁。（待續）</p>

<h3>「復堂詩詞稿」書後</h3>
<p>— 陳友琴</p>
<p>在杭州舊書攤上，偶然發現了一本淸代杭州最有名的文人譚獻（仲修）的復堂詩三卷詞一卷的舊刻，花了一包香烟的代價主千元，這一本好書就到手了。</p>
<p>它雖並不是「復堂類集」中殘本，而是咸豐九年仲夏福州影京師本重刻的，卷首有「三山剞　氏吳玉田」字樣，足見刻者是如何的鄭重其事。</p>
<p>沒有讀到「復堂類業」的我，得此一書，亦慰情聊勝於無。</p>
<p>我之知道譚復堂，還在民國十五年讀杭縣徐珂仲可所編的「淸詞選集評」（商務版）的時候，那一本書中所有的評語，幾乎全是「譚復堂師曰」。我心想旣是譚復堂詩的評語，編者何不改名爲「譚復堂評淸詞選」呢？（全書中只有極少幾關詞是用况夔笙的評語的）。</p>
<p>後來讀吳梅的詞學通論，談到譚廷獻，（譚獻又名廷獻）他說：一仲修詞取徑甚高，源委深達，窺其胸中眼中，非獨不屑爲陳（其年），朱（竹垞），抑且上溯唐五代，此浙詞之變也。仲修之言曰：南‘京詞敝，瑣屑餖飣，朱厲二家，學之者流爲寒乞，枚庵高朗，頻伽淸疏，浙詞爲之一變。余謂吳郭二子，不足當此語，變浙詞者，復堂也。……」吳梅光生對於復堂調推重如此。</p>
<p>其友丹徒莊棫（中白）爲復堂詞作序，有云：「……近世作者，竹垞擷其華而宋芟其蕪，茗柯沂其原而未竟其委，意內言外之趣，仲修所作，殆無憾焉……」這並不是阿其所好，而是古令人所共有的確評。</p>
<p>至於復堂之詩，其友人吳懷珍說得最爲懇切：</p>
<p>「……今君之爲詩其攖乎其心而動乎其情者，固不知何所感而然，即吾亦不能盡得其意之所在，然優柔善入，惻然動人，使人歌呼悲愉而亡以自主，要與古作者同出於性情之正者，嗚乎！切己則痛，難言則深，何其言之痛且深也。……」</p>
<p>打開復堂詩讀起來，覺得它的產造雖不多，但的確可當得吳懷珍的相許之言。其初存詩八十六首，北征詩百四首，閩遊詩九十首，只二百八十首。但篇篇精絕，想是作者自己刪訂的，兼綜漢魏六代初盛作者之長，而自成一家，中晚以下，皆所不屑，愈讀愈覺其可愛。往年我所編的「淸人絕句選」（開明版）只選了他在高郵所作三首絕句（見第九十七頁），一臠之嘗，未窺全豹，今見其集中，古近體幾乎無一不佳，古風太長，不便多所舉例，其律句，如：「贈儀徵王丈翼鳳</p>
<p>登樓一賦倍凄其，王粲年年在路歧；故國風烟悲骨肉，過江名士近流離。兵戈歲月人無色，文字關河　有絲。搖落西風江水闊，思家臥病雁來時。</p>
<p>送壽丈僑還諸暨</p>
<p>風雨夜如何？征鴻盡渡</p>
<p>河。先生猶道路，海內正干</p>
<p>戈。垂暮雄心在，深杯濁酒</p>
<p>多。未須臨易水，相送有悲</p>
<p>歌。」</p>
<p>今日讀之，猶足令人盪氣廻腸。</p>
<p>平風的短篇，如「小車行」云：</p>
<p>小車兀兀黃沙走，老父前，稚子後，道旁招行人，行人但搖首。三朝麥飯不入口，我家揚州，承平樂休；賊來如風，大男懸頭；白日慘慘，淮水浩浩；飛螅刺天，人賤如草。連營鼓角日嗚嗚，健兒肥馬塞道塗，小車兀兀挽馬芻。」氣息宛如孤兒行，想不到今日的淮北，仍舊和作者當時的景况一般。</p>
<p>復堂詞甲二十九首，乙亦二十九首，這五十八闋詞，我幾乎把它已讀上千百遍了。吳瞿安所賞識的蝶戀花六章，固然是溫韋遺音，決非專學南宋者可擬。即其中菩薩蠻諸作，亦未便讓庭筠獨步。</p>
<p>詞學通論中引其所作金樓曲唐棲月夜之作，（見原書一八二頁）予獨愛其滿庭芳云：</p>
<p>「花是將離，曲成憐子，心情不似當年，桃笙選夢，綠酒說從前。滿地蘿陰似水，無人到鬥草闌邊。風初起，池萍點點，搖蕩不成圓。聞辦楊柳外，乍調脆管，半　新弦。試重問齊宮舊事誰傳，消受晚來風露，離亭樹淡欲生烟。聲徐歇，高樓微月，翠袖隔重　」。書中有欽人黃崇惺子次氏親筆所書的跋語云：</p>
<p>「復堂詩詞共四卷，杭州譚廷獻仲修撰。蓋崇惺知詩以來所見當世之詩人惟此一人而已。仲修今爲吾邑宰，與吾未　觀面也。於高茶　處得其詩刻，携之歸，每一展玩，心目爲之爽然。光緒四年冬　黃崇惺記於福州寓齋。」</p>
<p>書法極佳，印章及十印泥，均臻上乘。黃君不知何等人，但由跋語中可知與譚獻同時，又知譚獻不但官含山知縣，亦曾作宰歙縣，此卷蓋黃君得之於福州，不知如何流入杭人之手？而今日我乃以區區一盒香烟代價易得之，視作拱璧，幸未任小販撕碎作包花生米之用，不可謂非此書遭遇之幸運也。</p>
<h3>關於華雷斯</h3>
<p>— 忠祈</p>
<p>英國通俗小說家華雷斯（EdgarWallace　1875-1932），是一個多產的作家，大概是在一九二八年，那時英國眞成了華雷斯狂，當時有出版家統計，平均每售出四本書，其中就必有一本是華當斯著的。後來在泰晤士報上，有人提議：在倫敎建一所「華雷斯博物館」，在那裏面可以看見那偉大的，右手寫小說，左手寫劇忠本，左脚寫論文，右脚寫劇評的作家－華雷斯。</p>

<p>巴氏一生作品甚少，所作者精緻細膩，不拘時間，不惜精力。此幅肖像，據說整整化費四年工夫，始告完成，每根金髮，每粒眞珠皆一筆不苟，衣服上之花紋尤其細心，整幅書面有如金鎊之上浮彫，凸出畫布，可以用手觸之。該作現藏倫敦國家盡廊。（劉獅）</p>
<h3>南通學院院刊引言</h3>
<p>— 張淵揚</p>
<p>南通學院自創辦迄今，凡四十餘年，校友遍佈國中，學校歷史之久，畢業人才之衆，位於全國高等敎育之林，未邊多讓焉！當年先賢嗇公張季直先生，爲謀國家現代化工業化，先後創辦嬝紡醫各專門學校於南通，期以一隅之地，造就各種實科之專門人才，爲全國齊業界奠定人才基礎，同時更於濱海區各縣，先後創辦各墾牧公司紡織公司，期于樹立規模，爲全國農工界奠定事業基礎。眼光之遠大，計劃之週詳，氣魄之宏偉，行動之果敢，雖至四十年後之今日視之，猶嶄新前進，其人其事，更値得千秋效法，舉世欽仰。南通學院在先天上具有創辦人之創造精神與優良傳統，而瞻望未來，更有事業上之重大使命，期待負荷。故學校之中辦雖屬私人，而各方之贊助則當仁不讓；學校之位置雖徧於一隅，而羅致之人才則南北　英；學校之學科雖僅限於農紡醫藥等專科技術訓練，而所造就之幹部，則常能供應建國工程之需用。如此循序漸進，不變馭變，埋首傳習，不求聞達，蓋四十年如一日矣。自十年前抗戰軍興，南通陷入敵手後，南通學院被迫遷來海上，中間變經艱危，數度掙扎，卒仍能保持獨立不屈服，弦歌不輟之生命力；蓋仍導因於學校固有之偉大歷史與優良傳統。淵揚以勝利後之四月，秉校董會命，來主校務，受事之始，即承校董會之意旨，宣示下列方針：（一）復校南通，（二）恢復誠樸學風，（三）繼承事業傳統。謹於此分別略陳之：</p>
<p>第一：何以必須復校南通？以辦高等敎育之適宜環竟而論，每上爲貿易經齊中心地，繁華喧囂，非利於辦學，雖不無敎學上之少數便利，然對於實行培養靑年心靈，敎育靑年品德等項基本任務，則殊多不利。南通環境恬靜，適宜研讀；先賢之遺型猶在，更處處足以供靑年之流連景仰。雖與滬上有一江之隔，交通略有不便，但校舍寬敞，農塲紗廠醫院之規模俱備，旣便研究，更利實習。故復校南通，實爲延續光大學校生命第一要務。去秋招收新生五級，已全部在通上課，今年暑後，仍擬在通續招新生，如其地區安寗，匪人欽迹，短期內可望學校全部重返故舍，以奠學院永久之基礎。</p>
<p>第二：何以必須恢復誠樸　　？南通學院之學風，一向誠實純樸。學子　　研究，勤苦奮發，惟以求得問世致用之學爲事，敎者，更信守師嚴通尊，不厭不倦之古訓，唯以傳迫授業爲務，此亦全係出發於創辦人之敷敎初衷。蓋創辦人張嗇公在世時會一再向學子諄諄訓勉，注重導學生入於靜心，耐苦，與多讀書，少議論諸境地。故凡南通學院出身之人士，無論散處　業敎育各界，無不格循此旨，守眞抱樸，努力於本位工作，幾已蔚成風氣。自學校遷滬後，學子染於時下通行之浮華習氣，同時更由於複雜之環境觀感，故身不能安，心無自靜；又無自辦工廠農塲以資實習。偶而隨師參觀流覽，走馬看花，自更不足以語耐苦習勞。同時學校圖書缺乏，社會讀書風氣不濃，故多數課程均以講授概括研討，以活動代替實習。論者謂南通學院之復校工作易，學風之恢復難，實不能謂爲無感而發者，去秋校董會議決先將新生班設於南通，主要目的即冀能自新生班開始，逐漸將往日之優良學風讀書風氣全部恢復，用意固甚深刻也。</p>
<p>第三：何以必須繼承事業傳統？此則理由甚明，無待細述。蓋南通張嗇公創辦之事業，自成一體系，有所謂「父敎育，母實業」之名言，敎育與實業必須配合，猶之乎宇宙間之孤陰不生，獨陽不長，險陽和而後雨澤降之之現象。敎育本為手段，而實業發達利用厚生則爲目的。敎育而不爲實業造就人才，或所造就者仍不能適用於實業各部門之需要，則此項敎育設施，不啻浪費，故敎育與實業應互爲表裏相與配合，然後建設有着，建國可成。</p>
<p>南通學院之前途，繫於此三項使命之能否漸次完成，欲完成此等使命，端賴乎全校師生之共同認識，與集中努力，本刊即爲欲求達到此項任務而誕生。易言之，本刊之任務亦即在於如何動員全校師生從速準備還校南通，勿再流連於繁華之海上？如何鼓舞全校師生崇實黜華，恢復昔日勤苦純樸之學風，如何勉勵全校師生接受傳統，繼承先賢事業，發揚而光大之。至於本身之編裁體例，分類別欄，文字技巧，乃　者事，姑不　述；唯是否能符合客觀上之期待，則殊未敢必，尙希校內同仁暨遠方同道常賜珠璣，不吝指示，俾此刊得繼續茁長繁榮，克達成其所負之理想任務，則非特淵揚一人稱幸而已也。</p>
<h3>青蘋果</h3>
<p>— 克人</p>
<p>雨絲在空中舞。</p>
<p>一種激越的不寗的感情衝擊着我，使我難得片刻的安謐，心頭總覺有件東西懸着，沈滯而痛苦。其實一切都已伏伏貼貼，就差動身了；難道這草原上還有什麼割捨不下嗎？除掉她——那個美麗而憂　的孩子；但我已經向她吿別過了呀　終於我披上雨衣，挾了把傘，走到泥濘的馬路上。</p>
<p>她的學校距離相當蘊，需要走盡這條馬路，然後再走一段城外的沙土道；雨天，那段道路上積滿大小深淺的水灘。但這些問題絲毫未曾困擾我，我此刻只感覺輕鬆和愉快；正如一個纏綿苦思的人，一朝痛下決斷後所有的情緒一樣。</p>
<p>在她學校的接待室裏，我會晤着她：</p>
<p>『出去吧』！我雙眼釘着她；聲調雖稍嫌急促，却極力保持着音樂味。</p>
<p>『不！還有課』；她顯得有點矜持而冷淡。</p>
<p>經騐與聰明，帮助我洞察靑春少女以綠葉和棘果妝飾着的心；因此我走近去，掛着一臉熱情懇切的表情：</p>
<p>『美本，走吧，我替您請假，一定』！</p>
<p>她遲疑半響，最後輕聲說：</p>
<p>『好，那麼您先走一步』。</p>
<p>我猜出她是怕同學們取笑。</p>
<p>校門外我遞傘給她，她無言。走未多遠，我喊來兩輛人力車　、雨還絲絲地舞着，我探首側顧，想從那輛車底雨布縫隙間偸看一下她底臉；到底是喜歡呢？還是惱着？但我底眼光始終被限制在她底胸前，紅毛衣上織着的一朵小金花上。</p>
<p>一刻鐘後，我們已坐在樂樂飯莊的餐廳裏。</p>
<p>我得意而溫情的說：</p>
<p>『今天是我們單獨外出的第一次吧？値得紀念的一次』。</p>
<p>她笑了，悠然的笑，剛才矜持冷淡的顏色全褪了。</p>
<p>當一個靑年初次約會女友的時候，談話往往不知由何處講起，習慣以後，自然談笑風生了。我此時像應付一次愼重的老試，隨時利用適當的技巧調劑我們的談話。</p>
<p>她突然問我，在Ｓ市有否女友，我正顏吿訴她：</p>
<p>『女友和愛人是截然兩件事，您也不妨多交男朋友，不過在那些朋友中，應選擇一個最知心的』。</p>
<p>她微微低下頭。她所想的，是否與我所想的屬於同一個世界呢？</p>
<p>雨住了，我邀舞邊散散步再回去，她痛快的答應了。</p>
<p>我依傍着她走，但總保持一點距離。天色漸近黃昏，又値雨後，路上很淸靜，我該不該挽着她底臂膀走呢？這不是很自然，也很平常的嗎？但，此她是章原；因此我到底沒有照所想的去做。</p>
<p>中途我陪她順道訪晤她的一位同學，那位同學也是最近兩天要離開此地的，她諄諄囑咐她別後多寫信；我忽然想起，她不是再三吿誠我走後少來信嗎？這是爲什麼？難道因爲我是男人，她家中就會責備她嗎？</p>
<p>後她的同學家走出，在門口揮手吿辭時，她故意跟我站緊在一起；我心裏一朵花開了。</p>
<p>送她回家時天已變黑，我計劃分手時能創造一個惜別的吻，至少也要把吻印到她底掌上。但事情往往在意外中發生；到距她底家門數步的地方，她只說了聲「到了」，便加快步子走上去，一邊喊門，一邊朝我揮手，昏暗中瞧不出她臉上的表情。</p>
<p>謎一般的地方，謎一般的孩子啊……</p>
<p>第二天，我便動身到東方海濱去；車站上，她送來一包產自草原的靑蘋果，裏面夾着一張紙片，上面寫着：</p>
<p>「祝福您，外邊多交幾個知心的人吧」</p>
<p>我惘然，隨手檢起一個青得可愛的小蘋果，使動仍到車窗外，願我底感情和它同留在草原。</p>
<h3>詩歌</h3>
<p>— 喻蘅</p>
<p>歌和詩比較來得直觀一點，因它和樂譜結合而構成音樂，樂譜是由感情而產生想像；歌詞是由想像而發揮情感。</p>
<p>詩則兼有繪畫’音樂，小說，散文…的藝術與文藝價値。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血515</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「喂…」鶴見抓下了電話筒，「誰？　，好好，會守一先生？請他快快上來．…」原來是本旅社電話，報吿守一來了。</p>
<p>「奇怪得很，剛才這位小姐來時，怎麼旅社倒沒有注意呢？」鶴見這麼問着自己。他沒有想到這位小姐，旣是那般神通廣大，還沒有方法混入旅社？</p>
<p>「碰見了令妹嗎？」鶴見在電梯門口，迎到守一，見面就是這麼一問。</p>
<p>「誰？」守一有些愕然。</p>
<p>「那剛才下去的那位小姐，拖着兩條小髮辮，長得挺美的？」鶴見邀着守一向屋子裏走着，一邊這麼吿訴守一。</p>
<p>「哦，圓圓的臉盤」，守一落座，一半猜想似的，「一笑兩個酒渦，北平語音，嗓子很甜，一雙大眼睛，骨碌碌地轉着…」</p>
<p>「對得　，她難道不是令妹嗎？」鶴見這才正式起疑了。</p>
<p>「嘿，她呀？」守一嗤的笑了。</p>
<p>「可不是她？…十六七歲？…」鶴見找補了年齡，生恐守一猜錯了人，「她？…」</p>
<p>「她是咱們百思莊四大淘氣之一，顏，顏色的顏－名呌子珊，人最小，可又最淘氣…並且還是一位闖禍精！…可是她怎麼會到這裏來的？…跑來做什麼？…」守一反問着鶴見。</p>
<p>「嘿，…一言難盡…，這才眞是一言難盡哪。」鶴見想到子珊剛才鬧的那一套，眞有些哭笑不得。</p>
<p>「您吃了虧？」守一看出鶴見的一副艦尬面孔。</p>
<p>「你們百思莊的人物，眞是了不起！」鶴見於是簡略地把剛才經過的那一套，吿訴了守一。</p>
<p>守一笑了一笑，忽地縐起雙眉來，「不好了…她問明了萍子的模樣？」守一定着雙睛，問着鶴見，旋又自言自語似的；「這幾個角色，又在生事搗鬼了…好好的計劃，怕要給她們弄糟了…」</p>
<p>「什麼？」鶴見驚疑起來。</p>
<p>「咱們得快點趕去了…！」守一瞧了瞧手錶。</p>
<p>「到底怎麼一回事哪？」鶴見不懂守一話中的主旨。</p>
<p>「本是約會了李明，會同韓方的人手，十點半在外灘公園門口聚齊，向虹鎭進攻。…爲什麼要到十點半呢？因爲鄙在覺厂老人和曉莊及家兄幾位的計劃，在十點半以前，就派鄙莊兩股人去，把其餘兩個窗子，先給他們掃淸，把「肉票」給取了出來。可是現在…」守一沉吟着，又在看着手錶。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>在痛苦的時候，很難描繪出痛苦。</p>
<p>當這痛苦已經確定了，換言之就是這痛苦已經和自身有了一個相當的距離，然而才能被描繪出來。中國古代的詩人，似乎對這一點瞭解得很淸楚，這呌做「痛定思痛」。</p>
<p>一切的經騐皆和痛苦相同，在經騐過程中，很難有恰當的體會。</p>
<p>太逼近另一個面孔，反而會看不淸楚，（自然太遠了也是同樣）總得維持一個相當的空間距離。</p>
<p>詩人，哲人……一切感覺特別敏銳的人，都能將自己的肉體和靈魂間維持一個相當的距離。在距離中，乃能求眞，求善，求美。</p>
<p>距離並不是疏遠。叔本華有一個好譬喩：一個寒冷的冬天，有許多豪豬擠聚在一團，想藉此取得溫暖。可是當牠們被此間所帶的箭芒刺痛了各個對方後，又不得已而散開。寒氣的襲繫，使袖們又聚　，聚緊了又復散開。最後牠們在經騐中得到了教訓，只有維持一個適當的距離，最爲相宜。旣可得到些微的溫暖，又不至於彼此刺痛。</p>
<p>這是一個有價値的寓言，値得　「會笑的動物」（據說只有人才會笑）聽一聽</p>
<p>我有一個積習，喜歡在深夜燈光下寫文章。我自愧思想像螢火蟲，在太陽光下，我連自己都看不見自己。</p>
<p>有人嘲笑我是夜貓子，我只有聊以解嘲地運用一句英國名言：</p>
<p>「黑暗較光明更易產生高尙的思想」（Darkness　is　more　productive　ofsublime　idea　than　light.）</p>
<h3>「錨」自東京歸</h3>
<p>— 苞卿</p>
<p>前幾天，第一艘戰時被擄歸還的商輪興安號，由日駛返祖國懷抱，在這船上載回了兩具鐵錨及鏈，和八枚砲彈。這些恥辱的古董具被日人陳列在東京靖國神社，作爲甲午戰爭的戰利品紀念的。</p>
<p>錨終於自東京歸了！但是回憶這兩具錨的歷史，和錨的歸還的交涉，它們的經歷，也何嘗不是國家的經歷呢！甲午戰爭時，我國北洋海軍經豐島海戰，黃海海戰及威海衛保衛戰三戰役後，全軍覆沒。被擊沈的有戰艦定遠，巡洋艦來遠，經遠，靖遠，致遠，成遠諸艦，砲艦威濟，湄云等艦及雷艇等，中彈焚燬的有　勇，揚威諸艦，觸礁沉的有廣甲號。而鎭宇級砲艦鎭遠，平遠，康濟等等諸艦，則在劉公島等處彈盡援絕而迫降。我艦隊雖或排水量大者，如鎭遠號排水量七，四三〇噸，較諸日艦最大排水量四，二七八噸，相差甚大。但皆護甲，砲備，航速不佳，且陸軍未能配合協同發揮戰力。然壯烈戰鬥之精神，則已大書於歷史。鐵錨等即係自被俘艦鎭遠號等艦上取下的。</p>
<p>交涉鐵錨歸還的消息，初傳於去年三月中旬中央社電訊，說日人願將甲午戰爭中所俘縝遠艦鐵錨歸還中國。其後，我國政府要求麥帥總部轉令返還上項各物。七月，麥帥總部拒絕中國歸還鐵貓的要求，說日本於一九三七年以前所獲財物，無權處理。但盟軍總部之拘訊「九一八」以來之日本戰犯，則其權限又豈止於一九三七年以後呢？這個時候，正是我國新艦隊自美經日返國時。</p>
<p>現在鐵錨，砲彈算是歸還了，在這一年當中，不知其中又經過駐日代表團的多少次交涉呢。可是，我國的恥辱的古董，在日本那些神社及其他公衆塲所存在的，又何止這些。甲午戰爭時的淸代的龍旗，戎服，將軍砲等等，必定還有許多陳列着，這就需要我僑胞隨時留意，隨時揭發。而我國代表團及時調查交涉歸還，也是更不能辭其責了。</p>
<h3>迎神賽會</h3>
<p>— 蕓</p>
<p>最近據鄕人來談，各地的迎神賽會又到處十分盛行，不但木偶泥神，牛頭馬面之類大爲活躍，並且一般土豪劣紳和地痞流氓，更頗多借此機會，聚賭演戲，通宵運且，弄得地方上秩序大亂，並且因賭而傾家蕩產者亦有。</p>
<p>且不談迎神賽會是一種怎樣迷信的舉動，但這總是一種粉飾太平盛世的鄕民行爲。本來，在安居樂業的農村社會，大家勤勞苦辛了一年，借這迎神賽會來鬆鬆麼頭，娛樂一下，原也未可厚非。只是今日何日？農村破產，農民的生活無一不煎熬得慘不堪言，我們眞何忍再見到有此種耗資甚鉅的賽會來浪費掉農民們僅有的一些錢財？</p>
<p>所以。鄕村上若干有閑的人，發起迎神賽會來點綴太平，實際上這裏面正包含着農民們無數的血汗和眼淚。</p>
<h3>汽車和種類</h3>
<p>— 灃莉</p>
<p>勝利以後，各種汽車在上海街頭出現，我曾坐過這些車，但是呌不出牠們的名字，爲着好奇心驅使，我作了一次調查，供給讀者參考：Bus　交通車cheese　Box　職員車Commander　指揮軍Crane　吊車jeep　吉普motor　cycle　機器脚踏車personnarycarrier步兵車pick　up　運輸車sedan　轎車staion　wagon旅行車truck　卡車weapons　carrier軍械車</p>

<h3>「青年中國」</h3>
<p>— 無邊</p>
<p>民族解放的戰爭使中國的靑年走上了抗日的第一綫，他們參加部隊服務，深入農村，組織民衆，動員民衆，消除了軍民之間的隔膜，使軍隊與老百姓打成一片，完成了軍民合作的最高要求，這是那些服務於抗日戰爭的中國青年的貢獻。</p>
<p>但是像劇本中的這一支政工隊，他們並不是生來就懂得這許多，他們不過是在工作中不斷的學習，使他們克服了工作上的困難。同時更重要的一點，是劇作者陽翰笙正確的指出了宣傳不能只靠賣「狗皮膏藥」所能收效的，必須要解除他們的疼苦，眞正爲他們服務，這樣才能使軍民變成一家。</p>
<p>繼「八千里路雲與月」後，這又是一部以描寫知識靑年在戰地服務的片子。其實這「靑年中國」是在大後方攝製的，而且攝製得很早，所以現在看起來覺得某些地方總有着相當的距離。</p>
<p>但由於劇本的樸實無華，使導演在演出上獲得了相當優良的成績。</p>
<p>更難得的是這部片子中，差不多網羅了大後方的名演員，陶金，魏鶴齡，項堃，吳茵，孫堅白，章曼蘋，楊微等都參加了，全劇以白楊的政工隊員，林斐的李母，錢千里的呂老師演技量為優秀。</p>
<p>這是一部値得介紹一看的片子。</p>
<h3>女人·女人　——「麗人行」題外談</h3>
<p>— 洛賓</p>
<p>看完「麗人行」感觸顏多，忍不住要作此題外之談。</p>
<p>女人，這個專用名詞的定義，好像從來沒有人正確底替它下過註解，尤其在我們這個國度裏，它是牛馬式的，花瓶式的，生育機式的，洩慾器式的……種種的，可供男人躉批零買的一種東西，它是「糞土」可以隨意踐踏，是「禍水」足以亡國傷身，是「奇貨」，能換取財當利祿。總之，它是包羅萬象的一切的一切</p>
<p>自從先哲先聖倡導經書禮法以來，作爲我們這社會構成份子的半數活人，就「平等」的被「優待」與「虐待」，知識的自由，工作的自由，甚至這生存的自由，概而括之統統由男人包辦，她們從　魂到肉體受役於男子的權力，誰最不自由，最服從，最能獲得「賢良」的尊號。</p>
<p>雖然歷史上有些名女人，像古希臘美女海侖，和我國的陳圓圓等，皆引起過生靈　炭的長年戰爭，她們舉足輕重就傾國傾城，但，平心而論地依舊是男人佔有慾下的犧牲品，是男人把她推上那個位置上去的。</p>
<p>幾千年來，壓在女人頭上的，灌注在地們思想裏的，生理的，精神的束縛，實在太多太多，換句話說，處在她們敵對地位上的男子勢力，還是太强太强。試舉一例：上海市去年度的素嬰，其中女性佔絕對多數，這是東方第一大都市啊，一般人的男女觀念尙且如此，假使推廣到敎靑文化經濟落後的偏遠內地，無疑的，這種現象一定更加厲害。</p>
<p>在此，我要價震申明，我雙非悲觀的命運輸者，指出這現象無非是想證明，女人爭自由解農的道路上困難重重，除去那些客觀存在的阻礙，其本身還存在許多毛病，像「麗人行」裏若英，就是一個典型的代表，她的思想與靈魂都不折不扣的對男權屈服，對自已的輭弱妥協，而這種女人確是爲數不少，誠然我們不能把這一切責任歸咎在女人身上，因爲造成這稱局面，是千百年男性　權會的結果。</p>
<p>可是，女人要求得眞正的解放，必須先革自已的命，摒棄那些苟安依賴的習性，不要拿有名無實的自由爲滿足。先有獨立的人格，然後才能談到其他等等。</p>
<p>再說一遍，這不是女人單方面的責任，假使這種不合理的現象還要延續下去，也是男子漢的恥辱，因爲他們不願意放棄特權</p>

<h3>莫札特底耳朵（軼事）</h3>
<p>— 克諦</p>
<p>「音樂神童」莫札特（Mozart1756-1791），他之所以成爲世界上知名的大作曲家，不但他底天才至今仍爲世人視爲奇蹟，而且他有一雙比衆不同的耳朵。</p>
<p>當她在四五歲的時候，就聽得出聲音高低的細微差別。有一次，他聽了一位客人演奏小提琴以後，他對那位客人說：</p>
<p>「你底小提琴的聲音跟我底小提琴的聲音比較起來，相差約有四分之一的音。」</p>
<p>莫札特常常喜歡到敎堂裏去聽長篇名樂的演奏，每次聽了回來，常常憑着留在腦海裏的印象而紀錄下來，結果不差毫釐，這種耳朶，眞是人間罕有！據歐洲學者考察研究他底耳朶的組織，確與尋常人不同，這是一種奇特的天賦。</p>
<p>但是，莫札特雖有了這雙深解音樂的耳朶，而幼時却最怕聽人家吹奏「伸縮喇叭」，他常說：</p>
<p>「這種聲音快要把我底耳朶震破了！」</p>
<p>由這種情形看來，彷彿一個能够領略精微音樂的人，往往跟那種大吹大擂的音樂是頗不相容的。</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>三年的軍事訓練總算不曾全白費，熊處是惱羞成怒，一發奮果然立刻又把那個可憐的女人摔倒了；這一次他使的勁更重，那個女人被摔得手足披離，仰着臉，躺在地上，好半響不能轉動，儘是牛樣的喘氣。</p>
<p>「好」！不少沒有心肝的　人在兩旁吶喊。</p>
<p>張昌不由氣往上一湧，立刻灑脫了緋緋的手，邁步向前。</p>
<p>「噲！小張！小張！……」原在他後面站着的盧前怕他要闖禍，慌不迭想喊住他。</p>
<p>「嗚……嗚……」然而空襲警報比他喊得更響，而且更有效，不但正想衝上去打一塲抱不平的張昌已經站住了，便是地上躺着的那個胖女人也像滾球似的立刻掙扎了起來；已在司機台上安坐着的侯局長伉　也來不及的自動放素了才佔倒的優越的座位，匆匆跳下車來，態處長劉連長忙着引導他們跑向附近的防空洞去；閑人和搭車的人也在一片混亂中間逃跑了七八成。前昨兩天鬼子飛機的認眞下侵，已把向來不很害怕空襲的桂林人嚇壞了。</p>
<p>身負劇團全責的祝兆年忙着指揮大家下車讓盧前做領導，先躱進防空洞去，他自己和工役老黃留在車上，看守那　東西</p>
<p>很快的又傳來了緊急警報。</p>
<p>「怎麼！你沒有走？」這時候，老說才發現滿面怒容，像石象似的挺立在司機台旁邊的原來的張昌；他的眼睛睜得滾圓，凝視着正在前面散亂地奔竄的人羣，胸臆間眞像蘊蓄着無限的悲憤。</p>
<p>老祝瞧他沒有說話，便從車上跳下去，輕輕地在他肩頭上拍了一下。</p>
<p>「放才看到的會使你這肅生氣？」</p>

<h3>Striving to Promote Five-Nation Cooperation, Strengthening the Traditional Friendship Between China and the United States: Minister Wang Reports on Foreign Affairs at the Council</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 22nd] The National Political Council held its third plenary session on the morning of the 22nd to hear Minister Wang Shijie's report on foreign affairs. The session began at 9:15 AM, with Chairman Li Huang presiding. Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen reported that 281 councilors had registered, and 214 attended on the morning of the 22nd. Minister Wang's report was followed by a question-and-answer session, and the meeting adjourned at 12:50 PM. The fourth plenary session was held at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, with Jiang Yong presiding. During the session, Gu Zhenggang gave a report on the work of the Ministry of Social Affairs and briefly answered written and oral questions. Subsequently, a vote was held to elect two chairmen to succeed the retiring chairmen of the presidium. After a ten-minute break, the meeting continued at 5:25 PM, with Xie Guansheng giving a report on judicial administration work and answering oral questions. The meeting adjourned at 7:40 PM. The fifth plenary session on the morning of the 23rd will cover the financial report, and the sixth plenary session in the afternoon will cover food, agriculture, and forestry reports.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 22nd] Foreign Minister Wang reported to the National Political Council that China had proposed that after the signing of the peace treaty with Japan, China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union should jointly administer Japan for 20 to 30 years. The United Kingdom and the United States have expressed their agreement, but the Soviet Union has not yet responded.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 22nd] Foreign Minister Wang gave a report on foreign affairs at the National Political Council on the morning of the 22nd, addressing the following four major areas one by one: (1) the Japanese issue, (2) relations between China, the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France, (3) the Korean issue, and (4) the protection of overseas Chinese. Regarding the Japanese issue, Wang pointed out that Japan had been our greatest enemy in the past, and this issue will not only affect our country's future but also the welfare of the world, so it must be approached with caution. Our basic policy towards Japan can be summarized in the following three points: (1) strict military control to ensure that Japanese aggression does not re-emerge, (2) political leniency, not interfering in Japan's internal affairs, and (3) economic measures to enable Japan to maintain a reasonable standard of living. The issue of Japanese reparations is being discussed by the Allied nations. There is no agreement among the countries on how to handle Japanese assets abroad. Regarding Japanese assets within Japan, the United States has decided to first take out 30% for China, the Philippines, the Netherlands, and other countries, and our country will receive half of that. We have already sent personnel to Japan to handle this matter.</p>
<p>When discussing the relations between China, the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France, Wang explained that for the sake of China's interests and the world's interests, cooperation among these five major countries is a necessary condition. The goal of our foreign policy is to promote coordination and cooperation among the five countries, and we do not want our country's situation to affect the relations among the five countries and endanger the future of the world. Regarding Sino-American relations, our consistent policy is to strengthen the traditional friendship between the two countries. This friendship is the purest and should not be changed by criticism or jealousy from any party. Wang deeply admired General Marshall's assistance in repatriating three million Japanese prisoners of war in China, and he believes that the conclusion of the Sino-American commercial treaty will greatly benefit the promotion of trade relations between the two countries. Regarding future economic assistance from the United States to China, Wang said: Our current need for American assistance is extremely urgent, and the United States is the only country that can assist China. At this time, not long after the end of the war, when the economy is in dire need of recovery, external assistance is needed for both industrial and commercial construction. This matter is currently being studied closely by China and the United States, and a more detailed report cannot be given at this time.</p>
<h3>Strict Implementation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, General Satisfaction with Relations with the United Kingdom</h3>
<p>Regarding Sino-Soviet relations, Wang stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs handles Sino-Soviet diplomacy based on the resolution of the previous National Political Council to "strictly implement the Sino-Soviet Treaty," and strives according to the principles of non-concession and non-subordination. Regarding the withdrawal of 700,000 to 800,000 Soviet troops from Northeast China, the Soviet government telegraphed our country last year, stating that they had been completely withdrawn by May 3rd of last year. Regarding the issue of Lushun and Dalian, the Soviet side stated that because the peace treaty with Japan had not yet been signed, the area was still in a state of war and we could not send troops there. Our country believes that the war against Japan has effectively ended. Currently, the Soviet side has agreed to our first sending an inspection team there, and the military and police issues are still being negotiated by both sides. Wang finally mentioned the "unpleasant incidents" at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference and explained that after our solemn statement, the conference did not discuss the Chinese issue, either internally or externally.</p>
<p>Wang then briefly reported on Sino-British and Sino-French relations, stating that Sino-British relations were generally satisfactory. The British side's draft of the Sino-British commercial treaty has not yet been sent. Regarding the recovery of Hong Kong and Kowloon, the British government has stated that it has abandoned its imperialist policy. If we can work to strengthen and deepen the relations between the two countries, the issue of Hong Kong and Kowloon should not be difficult to resolve. As for Sino-French relations, the main issue is the protection of overseas Chinese in Vietnam. Regarding the Korean issue, Wang stated that we wish to see an independent Korean government established as soon as possible. Finally, Wang gave a detailed explanation of how the Ministry of Foreign Affairs handles the protection of overseas Chinese. The report lasted a total of one hour and forty minutes, and its clear and detailed analysis was met with enthusiastic applause.</p>
<p>After a ten-minute break, the conference continued at approximately 11:10 AM, first listening to written inquiries, totaling 34 items, mainly concentrated on (1) Japan (including the issue of reparations), (2) China and the Soviet Union, especially the issue of Lushun and Dalian, (3) China and the United States (including loans), (4) the recovery of Macau and Hong Kong, (5) the protection of overseas Chinese, and (6) diplomatic personnel, six major issues.</p>
<h3>Important Issues to be Discussed, Handled According to Plan: Foreign Minister Wang's Concise and Pertinent Answers</h3>
<p>After the written inquiries were completed, oral inquiries were conducted, with eleven speakers, mostly addressing Wang's report and asking about the Japanese issue. Zheng Kuiyi believed that the three basic policies declared by Foreign Minister Wang needed to be revised. He pointed out that a democratic Japan cannot be realized as long as the emperor system is not abolished. The council requested last year that the Japanese emperor be listed as the number one war criminal. Why has the Ministry of Foreign Affairs not proposed this to the Allied nations? If we allow Japan to take advantage of international contradictions and rearm under the guise of democracy, then the day Japan makes a comeback will be the day the September 18th Incident is re-enacted. Zheng also called for strict handling of Yasuji Okamura and others who are still living freely in our capital. Chen Yaodong proposed that we cannot allow Japan to restore its 1937 standard of living, as that was the period when Japanese industry was most developed. Chen Baoyin, with his qualifications as an expert on Japan, reminded the people of the country that the Japanese have always regarded themselves as descendants of the gods and have always despised our country. This kind of erroneous mentality should be eliminated. Regarding the point of not interfering in Japan's internal affairs, Chen believed that the United States is carrying out a rectification movement in Japan, and we should actively participate.</p>
<p>The issue of Sino-Soviet relations was also a focal point of inquiries. Chen Yaodong believed that our failure to send personnel to the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement was a great failure. After eight years of sacrifice in the War of Resistance, our international status has plummeted, which is truly heartbreaking. In addition, Lushun and Dalian have not yet been recovered, and our representatives on the committee formed by the two sides are fewer than the Soviet representatives. Continued efforts in diplomacy are necessary. Pan Chaoying brought up some facts that have not yet been made public and hoped that they would be explained one by one. He advocated that some international treaties should be abolished, while Xie Mingxiao had even more radical proposals.</p>
<p>Yan Shutang advocated that diplomacy should be independent and autonomous and should not adopt a policy of using one country to control another. His catchphrase was, "Only by being close to China can one be close to foreign countries. We should be close to those who are close to China." He also said, "Diplomacy should transcend party affiliations and should not take party interests as its interests, but should take China's interests as its interests. Based on the above interests, when we conduct diplomacy, we should not listen to Moscow or Washington, but should listen to the people of our own country. We should shake hands with those who are beneficial to us, and reject those who are not, and we should not be constrained by diplomatic rhetoric and etiquette." Zhou Qianchong also expressed the same opinion, saying that after our country's long war, it cannot withstand a third world war. If China's diplomacy causes China to become a battlefield of the Third World War, then it will not only be a criminal against the world, but also a criminal against humanity.</p>
<p>He Baoren, regarding the issue of protecting overseas Chinese, questioned the diplomatic authorities about what effective measures have been taken in response to the threats to the lives and property of overseas Chinese, and hoped that a proper solution could be found for the overseas Chinese issue. He pointed out that the restrictions on remittances to overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies are extremely strict, so that some overseas Chinese only have enough money to eat one meal a month from the remittances they send back to support their families.</p>
<p>Zhou Qianchong and others raised questions about the diplomatic personnel system. Zhou hoped that the authorities could establish a reasonable system and that there could be ideal talents to cooperate, because the diplomatic arena is like a battlefield, and the battlefield needs strategists to cooperate, and the diplomatic arena also needs diplomats to cooperate.</p>
<h3>The Key to World Peace Depends on Whether Cooperation is Possible</h3>
<p>After the inquiries were completed, Foreign Minister Wang gave oral answers, first stating that he would pay attention to the various questions raised by the councilors. He then turned to the councilors and asked whether our country's foreign policy should be changed or whether it should follow the old patterns. Wang pointed out that the world needs peace, and China needs peace. In this age of the atomic bomb, peace is especially needed. However, what is the key to peace? The key to peace lies in whether China, the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and other countries can cooperate. If there is a mistake in this matter, the future is difficult to imagine. This is not alarmist talk. Our diplomatic authorities will not abandon their efforts to promote peace at this stage, and they will not do anything that would cause an uproar because of our actions. We should be patient where we should be patient, and speak when we should speak. A gentleman loves people with virtue. When we should speak, we should not remain silent. We hope that the people of the whole country can support the government's policy. Wang pointed out that taking another path is not difficult, but he fears that if we do not delve deeply, we will face danger. This is something that must be pondered deeply. Wang pointed out that there are currently about 13 or 14 important diplomatic issues that need to be resolved. The authorities have plans and steps to deal with these issues. Regarding the issue of Japanese reparations, during the war, 11 million people died directly from the war, and the direct property loss was 51.1 billion US dollars. We are making just and fair demands. In the future, in addition to machinery and ships, whether there is still a need for production facilities has been studied in the past few months. Regarding the issue of protecting overseas Chinese, we cannot send troops everywhere, and foreign countries also have different laws. Some countries do not even have treaty relations with our country. The authorities can only truly intervene. Wang concluded by saying: The authorities do not have the absolute certainty to solve all of the above problems one by one in a short period of time, but they will still work hard to do so, and hope that all parties can trust them. The answer lasted a total of seven minutes, and it was concise and pertinent. The meeting adjourned at approximately 12:50 PM.</p>
<h3>The Successors to the Two Chairmen of the Presidium are Announced</h3>
<p>Lin Hu and Zhang Junmai</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] At the fourth meeting of the National Political Council on the afternoon of the 22nd, a vote was held to elect successors to the chairmen of the Presidium. Councilors Xiao Yishan, Zhou Qianchong, Liu Zhongyi, Zhang Aizhen, and other four councilors supervised the voting. As a result of the election, Lin Hu and Zhang Junmai were elected as chairmen of the Presidium.</p>
<h3>Our Inspection Team to Lushun and Dalian Reportedly Departs at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Office, 22nd] The Lushun and Dalian inspection team will depart no later than the end of May, and will depart from a certain place by military transport. The candidates are Dong Yanping, Zhang Jianfei, Wang Zhuting, Wang Qiamin, Zhu Xinmin, Qiu Yin, Wang Yuantong, Wu Jiaofu, Xu Zuxi, and other nine people.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Office, 22nd] Regarding the issue of the national army stationing in Lushun and Dalian to assist administrative personnel in taking over Lushun and Dalian, our government is still negotiating with the Soviet side. It is heard that the Soviet side no longer insists on its previous views on the issue of stationing troops, but believes that Lushun and Dalian are still in a military period, and urged us to first establish a mixed military committee.</p>
<h3>Ministers of Social Affairs and Justice Reply to Councilors' Inquiries</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 22nd] The oral inquiries to the report on social affairs at the National Political Council on the afternoon of the 22nd were generally about relief issues, labor and farmer issues, and the issue of the number of legislators from professional organizations. Pan Chaoying believes that the Ministry of Social Affairs can contact religious organizations and local charitable organizations in various regions to handle social welfare work and relief work.</p>
<h3>Farmers are More Important than Industry and Commerce, Rural Areas are More Important than Cities</h3>
<p>Zhang Qianhua emphasized that farmers should be more important than industry and commerce, and rural areas should be more important than cities, but the opposite is currently true. Zhang Yishan further emphasized the government's neglect of farmers, believing that organizing farmers requires technology. It is not possible to approach farmers just by wearing Zhongshan suits or Western suits. The main thing is still to integrate with the farmers, and he hopes that the government can pay attention to this. Zhu Huiqing raised the issue of the number of legislators from professional organizations, believing that the number of legislators from professional organizations stipulated in the Legislative Yuan election law, which has been decided and passed, is only 56, and the proportion is not appropriate. Zhu believes that in both the National Assembly elections in 1931 and the National Congress elections in 1937, there was a proportion of one-third or more. Why is this the case this time? Is this the standard set by the Ministry of Social Affairs? He would like to ask Minister Gu to answer. Fu Baochang proposed that the 10 to 15 million refugees in the Shenyang and Sipingjie areas and the skilled workers who have been displaced in various places should be protected and relieved. Gu Zhenggang's reply briefly stated that, regarding our country's labor policy, it is planned to wait until the Asian Labor Conference to be held in our country next year and then formulate our country's labor policy based on the decisions of the conference, which would be more reasonable. Regarding relief, it is the responsibility of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration, and the Ministry of Social Affairs has no right to allocate it. Even the refugees in Northeast China are handled by the Executive Yuan Relief Administration because the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs has already been withdrawn.</p>
<h3>The Issue of the Number of Legislators Will Soon be Reconsidered</h3>
<p>The issue of the number of legislators from professional organizations is based on the 380 vocational representatives among the 1,105 members of the National Congress, and was originally planned to be 119. Later, the Legislative Yuan discussed and decided to change it to 56, and the National Defense Supreme Commission requested the Legislative Yuan to reconsider and change it to 119. It is heard that the Legislative Yuan will soon conduct a reconsideration.</p>
<h3>Lu Qian Raises Questions About Zhou Fohai's Exemption from the Death Penalty</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 22nd] Xie Guansheng gave a report on judicial administration at the National Political Council from 5:40 PM to 6:20 PM. At that time, the councilors had successively left the meeting, and there were few listeners. The report cited several written reports and began oral inquiries. The important ones included Lu Qian raising the issue of Zhou Fohai's commutation of the death sentence. Lu said: "The matters refuted by the Zhou Fohai verdict have all become the reasons for commutation in the pardon order. If the latter can be established, then the court's verdict should not be established. If the refutation is established, it cannot be used as a reason for commutation. The two must be one or the other. Government decrees and laws should not contradict each other." Lu also pointed out the corruption in the reporting of traitors. Chen Yaodong raised the issue of the extraterritorial rights of the US military in China. Cases such as the Zang Da's son case were all handled by the US military court, which is related to China's judicial sovereignty and should be paid attention to. Secondly, the treatment of judicial personnel should be improved. After graduating from the judicial group of the university and the law department, why can't they take the certification examination to become judicial officials? Zhang Bangzhen also mentioned the improvement of the lives of judicial personnel. Zhang also inquired about the case of He Dehui, the secretary-general of the Shanghai Municipal Government. Why was it not properly handled? Luo Heng also raised a solemn question about the He Dehui case. Luo said that this is the dignity of the national law, and He Dehui's case of being a traitor is really unforgivable. Peng Ge Chen pointed out the corruption of local judicial organs, which has almost become an institution for doing evil. Xie then replied item by item, stating that Zhou Fohai's case was legitimate because the National Government was authorized under the National Government Organization Law to grant pardons.</p>
<h3>US Military in China Did Not Overstep Their Authority in Handling Cases</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of the handling of criminal cases by the US military in China, if Chinese soldiers commit crimes in the United States, they will also be handed over to the Chinese military court in the United States for judgment. Regarding the certification examination for graduates of university law departments and judicial groups, it will be resolved soon. As for the He Dehui case, the Ministry of Judicial Administration was only investigating on the orders of the Executive Yuan and could not prosecute him. However, He was serving in Shanghai at that time and was entrusted by the government, so he should not be punished as a traitor. After the reply, Luo Heng stood up again and inquired, believing that judicial dignity must be maintained, and expressed his protest to Xie. However, at this point there was still a written inquiry, and there was not enough time to reply, so the adjournment was announced.</p>
<h3>The Basic Work of Protecting Overseas Chinese is to Sign Friendly Treaties with Various Countries</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Minister Wang explained the work of protecting overseas Chinese at the National Political Council, believing that our revolutionary basic policy is to show sympathy to nations striving for liberation and freedom. This is a must for followers of the Three Principles of the People, and for the permanent interests of our overseas Chinese, we should also adhere to this creed. Because our overseas Chinese in the Nanyang area must live in harmony with the local people in order to continue to develop their industry and commerce. Recently, wars have broken out in East India and other places, and the situation of our overseas Chinese is extremely dangerous. The policy and efforts of our government are to demand that both sides in the conflict give protection to the overseas Chinese and provide the overseas Chinese with the convenience of self-defense. Some places already have self-defense organizations. The basic work of protecting overseas Chinese at present is still to sign friendly treaties with all countries where overseas Chinese reside, so that overseas Chinese can obtain most-favored-nation treatment under the treaties. A considerable number of such treaties have been completed in the past year. The Sino-Thai Treaty, the Sino-Philippine Treaty, and the new treaties signed between China and some Central and South American countries are all of this nature. With the basis of treaties, the work of protecting overseas Chinese can be gradually advanced.</p>
<h3>Full Text of Zhang Qun's Report (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>On August 8 of last year, General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart jointly issued a statement stating that a peaceful settlement was difficult to reach. The government also reiterated that "the government will continue to seek a peaceful settlement, and negotiations can be held at any time." All of this is enough to show that the government always keeps the door open for peaceful negotiations. General Marshall's eight trips to Mount Lu in the hot summer are enough to show the enthusiasm of the mediator.</p>
<p>In early October of last year, when the national army attacked Zhangjiakou, the CCP requested a cessation of the attack. The government agreed to a ten-day period and expressed the maximum concessions it could make to resolve the current situation, while the CCP insisted that the ceasefire should have no time limit. General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart again issued a statement on October 8, explaining the importance of resolving all political issues peacefully, "but some issues that need to be resolved immediately are difficult to reach an agreement," and pointing out that "what kind of nature the local government in these demilitarized areas should be is more difficult to solve than the redeployment of troops." In order to seek a turnaround in this stalemate, the government again proposed eight understandings to the CCP on October 16, making the greatest concessions in order to order a ceasefire and convene the National Congress as scheduled to formulate a constitution. On October 21, representatives of the various parties gathered in Nanjing again, and the atmosphere of peace talks was very strong for a time. People from the third party were even more active in running around and putting forward compromise plans. However, Yan'an fundamentally opposed it and insisted on suspending the National Congress as a condition for restoring peace talks.</p>
<p>In order to compromise, the government issued a cease-fire order again on November 8, and ordered a postponement of the National Assembly, which was originally scheduled to be held on the 12th of the same month, for three days, so that the CCP had a final chance to consider it. All of these experiences are sufficient to fully show how the government sought peace talks and how much it valued the enthusiasm of third-party people who were running around for the country. Unfortunately, all efforts and hard work have not yielded results, which is a deeply regrettable thing!</p>
<p>After the National Congress, the CCP stated that there were two prerequisites for restoring peace talks: one was to dissolve the National Assembly (later changed to abolish the Constitution), and the other was to restore the military positions before January 13 of last year. Since then, the CCP has been pulling the distance of peace talks farther and farther, but as long as the government has a glimmer of hope, it will not abandon its original intention of cooperating with the CCP. In the process of consulting with the Youth Party and the Democratic League on reorganizing the government, everyone felt that if the CCP issue was not resolved, if the CCP did not participate in the government, China's problems would still not be fundamentally resolved. The Youth Party and the Democratic League were willing to make another joint effort with the government for peace talks. In mid-January of this year, the Standing Committee members of the two parties went to Beijing for talks and agreed on four proposals for restoring peace. The government prepared to send Mr. Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an to discuss with the CCP. Unexpectedly, the CCP rejected it. The government still entrusted the US ambassador to convey this proposal to Yan'an and issued a public announcement to inform the world (the original text of the proposal is omitted). This proposal was announced on January 20, and on January 25, Lu Dingyi, the Propaganda Minister of the CCP, issued a statement that, in addition to rejecting peace talks, he also wantonly slandered the head of state. The situation has reached this point, and although the government's desire to resolve internal disputes by political means is as sincere as ever, the government's path of striving for peace talks has come to an end. Since then, the CCP's expression has been to deny all the government's international actions to the outside world, without leaving any room for negotiation. The CCP should be responsible for the failure of the peace talks, and the facts are obvious. The government cannot unilaterally cease fire, nor can it unilaterally make peace, but later when the government reached an agreement with the Democratic League and the Socialists on the policy guidelines, it still decided in the fourth item that "the CCP issue should still be resolved politically as the basic principle. As long as the CCP is willing to have peace and railway transportation is fully restored, the government will seek domestic peace and unity by political means." Therefore, today's problem is not whether peace talks should or should not be held. The CCP does not express its willingness to have peace. No matter how lively we talk, what good will it do? Chairman Jiang reiterated the government's position on the CCP issue in his speech at your meeting yesterday. All of you gentlemen are very concerned about this issue, but how can we make the CCP turn back and make a political solution possible? As long as it does not interfere with the national need for unity, democracy, peace, and construction, the government is determined to give the most sincere consideration. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Random Notes from the Political Council</h3>
<p>— Our reporters Yu Zhenji and Zhang Ming</p>
<p>On the 22nd, Foreign Minister Wang gave a report on foreign affairs to the Political Council. The report lasted a total of one hour and forty-four minutes. The most detailed report was on the Japan issue, lasting twenty-eight minutes. The U.S. issue lasted eighteen minutes, the Soviet issue fourteen minutes, and the British and French issues five minutes each. From the length of time, one can see the general importance that our foreign affairs authorities place on each issue.</p>
<p>When Wang reported on Sino-American relations, he only mentioned two foreign names, namely MacArthur and Marshall. Wang greatly admired Marshall, pointing out that Marshall's contribution to mediating peace, although awaiting judgment by future historians, cannot be denied in his assistance in repatriating three million Japanese expatriates and prisoners of war. When reporting on Sino-Soviet relations, Wang used extremely solemn language and a particularly soft tone, making it somewhat difficult to hear, but everyone present listened attentively. Wang once mentioned the three words "unpleasant" in his report.</p>
<p>The generally noted Xisha Islands and Macau issues were not mentioned in the foreign affairs report. When reporting on Sino-Korean relations, the atmosphere of the entire venue visibly relaxed. At this time, newspapers from our publication and from Beijing and Shanghai were being distributed in the venue, and the councilors were busily reading them. A female councilor from Taiwan was audibly snoring. During the ten-minute break, the councilors chatted. Huang Yuren and another councilor criticized the content of Wang's foreign affairs report. Shanghai councilors Wang Xiaolai and Xi Yushu discussed whether dancing should be prohibited. Photography reporters were actively moving around, and Xie Bingxin, newly returned from Japan, became the best subject. In the written inquiries, some used classical Chinese, while others used vernacular Chinese. Zhao Xuefeng questioned, saying that "the authorities have contracted myopia and astigmatism, and have been greatly fooled by a certain country." The generals who raised oral inquiries in the second general meeting yesterday mostly stood by with their hands in their sleeves today. One person said, "Everyone should sing the good parts; if it's always just a few people talking, people will get tired of listening."</p>
<p>During the oral inquiries, Jin, the president of National Central University, Chen Dong, spoke the most fiercely, painfully pointing out that after the abolition of unequal treaties, new unequal treaties had arisen, and after the abolition of extraterritoriality, there was new extraterritoriality. After speaking for the full five minutes, he continued to speak eloquently, severely criticizing the "proud masterpieces" of some people.</p>
<p>New terms emerged endlessly. "Defeatism" and "tailism" could be heard from time to time. Praising terms could also occasionally be found. A certain councilor praised Foreign Minister Wang as a "world diplomat." After hearing this, Wang wanted to "laugh" but couldn't.</p>
<p>He Baoren cited examples to illustrate that due to the extremely strict restrictions in some colonial countries, the money that overseas Chinese remit to their home country each month for family support is only enough for one meal, and in some places, it is simply impossible to remit money.</p>
<p>The person who received the most applause today was Pan Chaoying. He mentioned the behavior of the "big noses" in the Northeast and advised some people not to be delusional. He also had strong opinions on the Macau issue, believing that "if we can't even deal with Macau, what's the point of talking about the U.S. and the Soviet Union?" The entire venue responded with warm applause.</p>
<p>Yan Shutang had the best speaking posture. When talking about foreign attitudes, Yan said that when dealing with "countries that harm us, we should extend our fists and fight to the end." As he spoke, he forcefully struck the table with his fist, causing the teacup to jump up. When Foreign Minister Wang replied, his attitude was extremely sincere, repeatedly saying, "It's not that I don't dare to take responsibility," and saying, "I am willing to humbly seek advice." In just seven minutes, he overcame a difficult obstacle. Ye Gongchao, who came with him, also breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>When the meeting was held on the afternoon of the 22nd, there were few councilors present. Comparatively, there were more reporters than councilors. Someone said that reporters could occupy the position of attending to politics, and if councilors were absent, those attending to politics could fill in.</p>
<p>Too few people listened to the judicial and administrative report, seemingly indicating that the Chinese people do not abide by the law, do not love the law, and are not very interested in the law. However, the councilors who were lawyers did not leave and listened very attentively. When Gu Zhenggang reported, his tone was sonorous and he gesticulated wildly, almost making people think he was conducting a symphony.</p>
<p>In the afternoon venue, newspapers were quite "popular."</p>
<p>Liang Shuhan entered and exited the venue four times. The first time he came in very late, sat down, and looked at the seating chart with great interest. After a long time, he picked it up and left. The second time, he entered from the main door, walked around in a circle, and exited from the side door without sitting down.</p>
<p>Kong Geng and Lu Qian sat in a row. Both had beards, one white and one black. When the two beards met, they had to chat for a while. The white beard was too thin, and the black beard was too fat.</p>
<p>Female councilor Xie Bingxin came for a short while this morning and then left. She came again in the afternoon and left early. A reporter asked if she was doing well in Japan. She said, "There's just nothing to eat, everything else is good." A reporter asked if she was very ill. She smiled and denied it. Mrs. Bu Lizi was present all day today and stayed until the adjournment, even for the judicial and administrative report.</p>

<h3>The Battle in the Yimeng Mountain Area Comes to an End. The Main Force of the Communist Army Suffers Heavy Losses. Seven Columns Are Completely Defeated and Flee in All Directions.</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Xuzhou, 22nd] The large-scale annihilation battle of the main force of the Communist army by the National Army in the mountainous area east of the Mengyin-Qingtuo Temple Highway in the Yimeng Mountain area has now come to an end. Since the 13th, the Communist army, with ten columns and thirty divisions, totaling about 250,000 men, launched a counterattack against the Mengyin Duozhuang and the area north of Qingtuo Temple. They engaged in an unprecedentedly fierce main force battle with the National Army, which was blocking the attack. The Communist army ultimately suffered heavy casualties and was tragically defeated by the 22nd.

<h3>The Japanese Reparations We Have Obtained Can Build 50 Factories. The Transportation Problem Requires Careful Planning.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] The reparations obtained by our country may include more than 480,000 tons of machinery, shipbuilding, steel, light metal, chemical, and power industry equipment. This will cause a huge transportation problem that requires careful and thorough planning. According to a person close to our country's delegation, our government has an almost complete plan, but there are difficulties in gathering a sufficient number of ships, so it is hoping for the return of ships. At the same time, the Chinese government has plans to utilize the reparations. It is estimated that these reparations can be used to build 50 factories, and the remaining machinery will be distributed to existing factories. Among these 50 factories, there will be 19 mechanical factories, 7 power plants, 10 light metal factories, 12 chemical factories, and 2 shipyards. A portion of the reparations transported to China will be port equipment to accelerate loading and unloading and avoid delays similar to those experienced in handling UNRRA materials. Once the transportation work begins, it will be maintained continuously until it is completed, and no materials will be left piled up on the docks to rust. A large number of ships are needed to transport this huge amount of materials back home.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Be Vigilant Against Japan's Rearmament!</h3>
<p>When Foreign Minister Wang reported on current diplomacy at yesterday's National Political Council, regarding the Japan issue, he stated: "In order to eradicate the scourge of aggression and ensure lasting peace, our country advocates the complete disarmament of Japan and the strict restriction of any heavy industry that could form the basis for rearmament. In the future, upon the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, it should be jointly monitored by the United Nations." This statement can be regarded as the consistent stance of our government regarding the disarmament of Japan. It is just and reasonable, and the Allied nations should have no objections. However, in recent days, the Japanese Foreign Ministry has suddenly proposed a request to grant Japan a "small military force" to gauge the attitudes of various countries, which deserves our attention.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 18th: An official from the Japanese Foreign Ministry recently inquired with people from the Allied nations about their attitude towards the request to establish a 100,000-strong army in Japan to replace the US military and other Allied forces after the end of the occupation. The official emphasized that this army and air force are necessary to maintain internal order, especially to prevent labor unrest and smuggling. Although the Foreign Ministry denied this on the 19th after this news was released, foreign news agencies have recently frequently reported news about Japan rebuilding its military, indicating that the Japanese Foreign Ministry's denial is just a formality that cannot conceal the actual intention.</p>
<p>We are paying close attention to this news. Japan's shocking request, not made on the eve of the Allied peace conference with Japan, but suddenly proposed now for testing the waters, precisely illustrates the failure of the Allied powers' control over Japan and the excessively lenient policy of General MacArthur. At the same time, it shows Japan's careful planning, insidious suspicion, and lack of sufficient awakening. American scholar Owen Lattimore once said: Japan is a "time bomb" that can explode at any time. We Chinese, facing this bomb, have experienced more than half a century of disasters since the First Sino-Japanese War. It has been almost two years since the Allied victory over Germany and Japan, but not only has a peace treaty with Germany not yet been agreed upon, but the convening of a peace conference with Japan is still far off. In the past year or so, Japan has shown many tricks in the cracks of international relations. This time, the revelation of the rearmament request has the strongest smell of gunpowder and the greatest risk of explosion, undoubtedly burying a danger to world peace.</p>
<p>According to the Potsdam Declaration, the Japanese militarist system should be destroyed, and Japan's army, navy, air force, and military industry should be dissolved. However, in the past year or so, the trials of war criminals have been delayed and not judged, and the remnants of the military and the Mitsui and Mitsubishi magnates are still mostly lurking among the people, not having been "purged." On the surface, the Japanese military department has been abolished, the conscription law has also been abolished, a large number of army, navy, and air force personnel have been demobilized, and all military weapons have been almost completely destroyed. However, in fact, Japan still possesses everything needed for a large war machine. What is currently lacking is only raw materials. Due to the contradictions in international relations, the United Nations Far Eastern Commission and General MacArthur in Tokyo have been lenient in their control over Japan, resulting in potentially worrisome consequences. Recently, the Far Eastern Commission decided to allow Japan to retain its industrial production capacity from 1930 to 1932, which is tantamount to having already armed Japan. The peace conference with Japan has not yet been convened, and the United States has already planned to withdraw US troops by June next year. After the withdrawal of the occupation forces, whether Japan should be monitored and whether Japan should be armed are all problems. We Chinese people are naturally most concerned about these issues.</p>
<p>Recently, someone asked MacArthur: "How will Japan protect itself after the US occupation forces withdraw?" MacArthur replied: "One way is to let it retain a small amount of military force." Japanese officials were overjoyed by MacArthur's statement, believing that Japan would be tasked with the mission of a "anti-communist bulwark." Therefore, Japan's request to retain a "small amount of military force" is not accidental; it has been a long time coming, and its intention to take advantage of opportunities to pursue its old dream of militarism is obvious. The development of this situation should be deeply noted by the people of the country, and vigilance should be heightened at all times.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Japan's motivation for establishing an army of 100,000 is to repeat the old trick of Germany building its military twenty years ago, in order to achieve the goal of comprehensively rearming. After World War I, although the Treaty of Versailles disarmed Germany, it did not eliminate the ideology of militarism and allowed Germany to maintain a standing army of 100,000. It used a mercenary system, but did not allow the existence of an air force. German Defense Minister Hans von Seeckt used this standing army of 100,000 to train elite soldiers in rotation, retiring and recruiting every year. In a few years, it became the backbone of the national defense force and the main force for building the military. Hitler's rise, with a roar of anger, turned this force latent among the people into millions and millions of elite soldiers, eventually leading to World War II. If the Treaty of Versailles had completely abolished Germany's military at the time, the course of history would not have plunged mankind into this war. Modern Japan's military system originally imitated Prussia, and Japanese soldiers have deeply studied German military thought and have a particularly thorough understanding of the history of Germany's rearmament. Therefore, Japan's request to retain a "small amount of military force" is actually intended to turn over a new leaf and relive Germany's old dream of expanding its military. We are most capable of recognizing its careful planning. We stand on the position of safeguarding world peace and oppose Japan's request to rebuild its army and air force. We also hope that the Allied nations will convene a peace conference with Japan as soon as possible and conclude a peace treaty with Japan. Regarding the prevention of Japanese aggression and the subsequent control of Japan, US Army Chief of Staff Dwight D. Eisenhower said: "After a peace treaty with Japan is concluded in the future, the occupation mission should continue; the method is to have an international security force monitor Japan; at the same time, Japan's education should be civilized by the United Nations civil affairs agencies." Eisenhower's views are very correct. We believe that if the Allied nations can take this step, they can prevent the re-emergence of aggressor ideology. We hope that the Allied nations will seize the opportunity and thoroughly prevent the revival of Japanese militarism!</p>
<h3>Everyone is Responsible for Stabilizing Society</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government, in conjunction with the Garrison Command, yesterday formulated four measures to maintain public order, and Mayor Wu also announced his four wishes to reporters. We believe that whether these measures can be earnestly implemented is the key to whether public order in this city can be maintained. Since the authorities have made this announcement, it is expected that they have the determination to enforce the laws, and we will wait and see. We also agree with Mayor Wu's appeal to the community. Because we have always believed that stabilizing society is not only the duty of the government, but also the responsibility of the general public. If the government does not have the cooperation of the people, especially the cooperation of good law-abiding citizens, it will be difficult to exert its effectiveness in maintaining public order. For example, if a theft is not reported to the authorities, or if a person is harmed and not prosecuted, even the most virtuous officials will feel powerless. In an era, if righteousness declines, the virtuous and good hide, and everyone only knows to close their doors and avoid trouble, fearing that falling leaves will break their heads, allowing those violent and domineering groups to act wantonly, society will cease to be society, and the country will cease to be a country. Therefore, the current situation is that a small number of young students have unsettled blood and rash emotions, leading to erratic actions and a lack of reason. We believe that this is not a cause for deep concern. What is most painful is that the general public, who bear social responsibility, either stand idly by or just sigh secretly, and have not yet actively taken responsibility to turn the tide and save the social atmosphere from collapse. If adults are still hesitant and evasive, thinking that getting through one day is enough, unwilling to face reality, distinguish right from wrong, and even more unwilling to stand up and stop the turmoil, it will inevitably lead to a decline in morale and the deterioration of the overall situation.</p>
<p>We want to solemnly remind the people of the country, especially the citizens of Shanghai, that they must support the laws of the national government, respond to the call of the authorities, gather the power of justice, and stop the conspiracy of disruption. Only then can we live and work in peace and contentment, and the country can be built and revived. A critical moment is fleeting!</p>

<h3>Mountbatten Plan Under Secret Discussion; Partition of India Largely Decided; Nationalization of Army Still to be Studied</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] Authoritative sources say that Prime Minister Attlee and Viceroy Mountbatten have informed Conservative Party leader Churchill, Eden, and Conservative leader in the Upper House, Cranborne, of the plan drafted by the Viceroy to present to Indian leaders on June 2 regarding the procedures for transferring political power in India. Prime Minister Attlee also intends to inform Liberal Party leader Davies of the plan. The Labor government is only informing the opposition parties and not seeking their opinions. The Labor government's actions are entirely proactive, and the opposition parties have complete freedom to take any action. The negotiations conducted by the Viceroy in London are being carried out in an atmosphere of extreme secrecy. Officials have made it clear that the British proposal will not be announced until the Viceroy formally presents it to Indian leaders. Although there is much speculation about the content of the proposal, political figures generally believe that the partition of India is inevitable.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 21st] Well-informed government sources claimed today that Britain is preparing to divide India into two or more independent countries as a final solution to the Indian problem and to allow at least part of it to retain its status as a British imperial colony. In addition to a Muslim state and a Hindu state, there will also be a Sikh state (a Sikh nation) and princely states (including part of the 562 princely states). This is almost certain because political and religious differences in India are deeply rooted, often leading to violence such as murder and arson, making partition necessary. Colonial Secretary Addison, a veteran politician of the Labor Party, has been summoned to attend cabinet meetings to discuss matters with Viceroy Mountbatten.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 22nd] Ismail, a member of the Indian Army Nationalization Committee, told this agency's reporter last night that the Indian Army may become "Indianized" by June of next year, before Britain withdraws from India. I make this statement based on the results of my investigation. Some senior generals believe that the nationalization of the army will take several years, but I do not think so. The vacancies left by the withdrawal of British troops will be filled by recruiting demobilized officers and civilian technicians. The Indian Army Nationalization Committee is not currently considering the division of the Indian army. This matter will be studied after a joint committee of military experts and politicians is formed on June 2.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 21st] It was recently announced that the report of the Indian Army Nationalization Committee proposes that seven key positions in the Indian Army be assigned to Indian officers, including the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, the Chief of Staff of the Army, and the Commander of the Army Headquarters in New Delhi. During the war, a large number of Indian officers were promoted to warrant officers, but most of them were specialists, and the Indian commanders of several regiments were lieutenant colonels.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 21st] It is learned that Indian Defense Minister Singh met with the Viceroy before Mountbatten returned home and requested that the Indian Army also be divided into Pakistan and Hindustan. Observers say that this is a tactic of the Congress Party, which still hopes that India can maintain its unity and believes that if the British cabinet understands that the division of India means the division of the Indian army, it will do its best to avoid the division of India.</p>
<h3>All-India Muslim League Leader Elaborates on the Meaning of Pakistan; Advocates a Defensive Alliance with Hindustan; Willing to Establish Friendly Relations with Countries in the Near East and Far East</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 21st] Jinnah, the chairman of the All-India Muslim League, today gave a statement to this agency's reporters, elaborating on the meaning of Pakistan as demanded by the Muslim League, and advocating an alliance between Pakistan and Hindustan. The main points of Jinnah's statement are as follows: (1) The Muslim League will request Hindustan to grant a corridor to connect the northwest and northeast parts of Pakistan in India. (2) The Muslim League will fight against the division of the provinces of Bengal and Punjab, regardless of any land area. (3) A truly beneficial relationship can be established between Pakistan and Britain. (4) Pakistan and Hindustan should establish friendly and mutually beneficial relations. (5) The Pakistan government will be a representative government of the people. (6) Pakistan will apply to join the United Nations organization. Jinnah's answers to other questions raised by reporters are as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) How will the army be divided, and is it planned to establish a defense agreement or any kind of military alliance between Pakistan and Hindustan? (Answer) All troops must be completely divided, and I also advocate the establishment of an alliance agreement or treaty between Pakistan and Hindustan to promote mutual benefits and prevent external aggression.</p>
<p>(Question) Even if Punjab and Bengal are divided, do you agree to establish a federation of Pakistani states? (Answer) A portion of the Hindu aristocratic class in Bengal and the Sikhs in Punjab have called for the division of these two provinces. In fact, after the division of the two provinces, it will have extremely unfavorable effects on the two provinces, especially the Sikhs in Punjab, and the aristocratic Hindus in eastern Bengal and eastern Punjab will also suffer great losses. The demand for division lacks careful consideration, and if the British government unfortunately agrees, it will pose a great danger to the future. I have always maintained that Pakistan should be a country that can survive and have strong strength to stand side by side with Hindustan. For this reason, I firmly oppose the division of Bengal and Punjab, and we will fight to oppose it regardless of any land area. (Question) After the establishment of Pakistan, do you still intend to establish a Pan-Islamic state from the Near East and Middle East to the Far East? (Answer) The doctrine of a Pan-Islamic state has long become a thing of the past, but for the sake of mutual benefit and world peace, we should establish friendly relations and engage in cooperation. After the establishment of Pakistan, we should extend a hand of friendship to the Near East, Middle East, and Far East.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the general foreign policy of Pakistan, and do you plan to apply to join the United Nations organization? (Answer) The foreign policy of Pakistan aims to maintain peace and friendly relations with all countries, and we also intend to fulfill our due responsibilities in the United Nations organization.</p>
<p>(Question) Which major country is Pakistan most likely to rely on? (Answer) We believe that the powerful country that is most beneficial to us is actually not a question of relying on any powerful country. At the same time, we should establish friendly relations and alliances so that all participants in this alliance will benefit.</p>
<h3>American Newspaper Comments on the Indian Situation: Partition Will Not Succeed</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] The Washington Post said in an editorial today that the partition of India will not succeed. If this is implemented, people must move their residences, the scale of which is unprecedented in modern times and difficult to accomplish. Past experience shows that large-scale migration of people inevitably causes great suffering to both body and mind, and only a brutal totalitarian government can do it smoothly. In the past, those who drafted the Treaty of Versailles made a big mistake when redrawing the map of Europe, dividing it according to ethnicity and religion instead of considering economic factors. The answer to problems such as religious conflict in India seems to lie in strengthening the local economy, and should not be solved in a dogmatic and arbitrary way, but this answer goes against the entire trend of modern politics. From the current situation, the partition of India seems to be regarded as the only way to escape, but in fact, its impact will divide India into two hostile camps. The concept of partition obviously does not take into account economic needs, which is its weakness. Jinnah's advocacy of partition will not only deprive Hindus of their largest cities, but will also incorporate areas such as western Bengal and eastern Punjab, where Hindus are in the majority, into Muslim-ruled areas.</p>
<h3>American Republican Congressman Smith Says the Soviet Union Covets Alaska; It May Become a Second Pearl Harbor</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] Republican Congressman Smith declared in the House of Representatives today, "The Soviet Union is now coveting Alaska. If we are not careful, it may become a second Pearl Harbor." Smith asked American military experts to "formulate a defense plan for Alaska." It is said that there is sufficient evidence that the Soviet Union is intensifying its activities in the skies over Alaska. If we can act decisively at this moment, we can stop communism in the Western Hemisphere. Smith then proposed immediately recruiting military personnel to serve in Alaska, encouraging civilians to migrate to Alaska, developing natural resources, and developing land, sea, and air force bases.</p>
<h3>President Truman Signs American Aid to Greece and Turkey Bill</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 22nd Broadcasting: President Truman recently signed the $400 million aid to Greece and Turkey bill, which made the United States' foreign policy of supporting weak countries in resisting aggression effective. Truman called this move "an important step in establishing world peace" and at the same time proved that the United States will work hard to promote peaceful conditions, and that maintaining domestic order and economic independence in various countries is an important condition for peace.</p>
<h3>US House of Representatives Finally Approves Foreign Relief Bill</h3>
<p>Maintains Original Amount of $350 Million</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] The government's proposed $350 million foreign relief bill was finally passed by Congress today. When the Senate passed the bill, Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg declared that President Truman is now considering sending several "highly experienced Red Cross personnel" to implement the plan. Red Cross Vice President Allen is slated to hold an important position. The House of Representatives also passed the bicameral conference committee's revised bill by a vote of 288 to 86, approving the full amount as requested by the President. Initially, some members of the House requested that the bill be returned to the conference committee to maintain the original House proposal, reducing it to $200 million, but this was rejected by a vote of 170 to 205. The final revised version of the foreign relief bill stipulates that the recipients are China, Italy, Greece, Hungary, Austria, Poland, and the Free Territory of Trieste, and that at least $15 million should be allocated to the United Nations' emergency relief fund. Republican Congressman Judd declared in response to questioning that if any country uses the aid to maintain its military beyond a fixed quota, the President may order the suspension of relief. This bill is completely different in nature from the $400 million aid package to Greece and Turkey to prevent communism.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] Congress today passed President Truman's $350 million foreign relief bill and has sent it to the White House for the President's signature. A joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives has already approved the use of this relief fund to provide emergency aid to Austria, Greece, Italy, Hungary, Poland, China, and Trieste, where famine prevails. The legislative measures passed are as follows: (1) Approval of an allocation of $75 million to immediately begin relief work. (2) Allocation of $15 million to $40 million to the United Nations to be used as a European children's relief fund. (3) Assurance that these relief funds will not be used for political purposes and that their distribution will be monitored by a US delegation.</p>

<h3>Middle Eastern Countries Organize "Anti-Communist Alliance"</h3>
<p>[United Press, Baghdad, 22nd] The Jordanian envoy to Iraq, Arafani, stated today that King Abdullah of Jordan intends to organize a "anti-communist alliance" of Middle Eastern countries.

<p>To seek worldwide peace and prosperity</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Jefferson City, 21st] Republican presidential candidate Stassen called on the United States on the 21st to adopt a three-year plan and allocate 10% of its food and goods to promote world peace, prosperity, and freedom. This was Stassen's first major foreign policy speech since returning from his travels in Europe. Speaking to 35,000 people at a United Celebration, he said that the United States should no longer make donations, but should manage the funds, excluding military armaments, and hoped that the government would not interfere with economic freedom when implementing this plan. He opposes Wallace's proposed policies. All matters should be discussed with the United Nations Social and Economic Council, but we should manage this plan ourselves, he said.</p>
<h3>US State Department Carefully Considering Large-Scale Foreign Aid; Treasury Secretary Snyder Reveals at Press Conference</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 21st] Treasury Secretary Snyder revealed at a press conference today that the State Department is conducting a large-scale review of the world economic situation to consider possible foreign aid plans, and that US experts will seek opinions from foreign governments. Experts from the Treasury Department, the National Advisory Council (a committee composed of the Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, and Secretary of Commerce to handle foreign aid plans), will jointly study this plan with Secretary of State Marshall's expert committee. Marshall stated yesterday that he would not request congressional approval for new foreign aid packages until the study is completed. Snyder also said today that the US government has not received a new loan request from the UK. He declined to comment on the New York "Journal of Commerce" editorial, which stated that "Britain will inevitably request another loan from the United States by the end of next year in order to complete its reconstruction plan."</p>
<h3>Acheson Calls for Continued Aid to War-Torn Countries</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd] Undersecretary of State Acheson (who has now resigned) delivered a speech last night for "International Trade Week," arguing that the United States should continue to provide aid to war-torn countries in 1948 and 1949, whether in the form of emergency loans or gifts, as this is the only way to break political extremism. Secretary of State Marshall attaches great importance to this issue, he said. Regarding this matter, according to informed sources, Secretary Marshall's previous statement that he would not submit new loan and aid requests to Congress only meant that he would not submit them before 1948.</p>

<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 22nd] The US-Soviet Joint Commission, which solemnly opened yesterday in Seoul, began its formal meetings today.

<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 22nd] Syngman Rhee and Kim Gu issued a joint communiqué to the press, hoping that the US-Soviet Joint Commission will "quickly achieve its declared goals, abolish the 38th parallel dividing line, and establish an independent democratic government." Rhee and Kim's communiqué stated that whether they participate in the discussions of the Joint Commission will be decided by individual leaders and groups, and continued: "We cannot blindly follow the basic principles of the Joint Commission unless two major points can be satisfactorily clarified: the so-called trusteeship and independent government are contradictory. Therefore, the word 'trusteeship' in the Moscow resolution must be revoked or given a clear definition and announced so as to clear the path for establishing an independent government."</p>

<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] Although the compromise proposal put forward by the Democratic Party was established on the 22nd, the Liberal Party has become very isolated emotionally due to the defection of members of the Democratic Party's Laqi faction and the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker. Even if the previous agreement is restored and the four-party coalition cabinet with the Socialist Party as Prime Minister is reconfirmed, the possibility of new difficulties arising regarding the allocation of cabinet ministers, ratios, and other issues is still very high. Therefore, in addition to the opposition between the Socialist and Liberal parties, the opposition between the Liberal and Democratic parties has also become apparent, and the political situation has become more chaotic.</p>

<h3>MacArthur Considering Using Japanese Gold Reserves to Continue Funding Japan's Industrial Recovery; Japanese Export Trade Sees Dramatic Increase</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st] Officials in the Army Department responsible for Japan's international trade affairs announced today that MacArthur is considering using Japan's $1.3 billion gold reserves to continue funding Japan's industrial recovery. This fund can be used for self-liquidating enterprises, such as importing raw materials and paying for the advances with manufactured goods. MacArthur has the right to use these reserves. This plan is currently under consideration here and is likely to be completed in the short term. It is generally known that Army Department officials are raising funds to allow for broader Japanese imports, such as cotton. Negotiations on this funding are underway with the Export-Import Bank in Washington. The Export-Import Bank is also considering establishing a company with the same goal.</p>

It is reported that the State Department believes that: (1) US trading companies are established to promote international trade. (2) This arrangement is the first step in direct trade between US merchants and Japanese manufacturers. Therefore, the prohibition is still under consideration.</p>
<h3>Another Yalta Secret Agreement: Britain and the Soviet Union Had Established Repatriation Agreement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] Authoritative sources said: British authorities forcibly repatriated approximately 180 Soviet citizens residing in the Rimini concentration camp in Italy on May 8th and 9th, in accordance with another secret agreement in the Yalta Agreement. When British Foreign Secretary Mayhew explained in the House of Commons today the forced repatriation of these refugees, he stated that these people were Soviet citizens who had to be repatriated according to the Yalta Agreement. However, neither the Yalta Agreement, the Yalta Annex published last month, nor the secret agreement related to China published in February 1946 contained provisions regarding the repatriation of refugees. This proves that in addition to the secret agreements previously published, there are still secret agreements on the repatriation of refugees in the Yalta Agreement. A Foreign Office spokesperson explained tonight that in addition to the three agreements established at the Yalta Conference in February 1945, Britain and the Soviet Union also established a bilateral refugee agreement. Its content, except for a part leaked through semi-official channels, has not been published to date. According to the original provisions of the agreement, the UK is responsible for repatriating Soviet citizens in areas within the pre-war borders of the Soviet Union liberated by the British army to the Soviet Union. However, the question of whether Soviet citizens who did not wish to return to the Soviet Union could be forcibly repatriated was not discussed at the time. Later, when the fact that Soviet citizens did not wish to be repatriated to the Soviet Union occurred, the British government adopted the principles of repatriation listed in the American Wickersham-Clark directive. The directive was communicated to Foreign Minister Molotov by the former US Secretary of State at the Moscow Conference in December 1945. According to the directive, the definition of repatriated personnel is as follows: The UK is responsible for repatriating Soviet citizens who were within the borders of the Soviet Union on September 1, 1939, and who also had one of the following situations: (1) Those who were arrested wearing German uniforms; (2) Those who were in the Soviet army on June 22, 1941 (the day the Soviet Union entered the war) and had not been discharged; (3) Those who the Soviet authorities can prove assisted the enemy. The British Foreign Office spokesperson also stated that all Soviet citizens who were forcibly repatriated from Italy to the Soviet Union this time had been carefully investigated beforehand, and there were no suspicious cases among them.</p>

<h3>Hess's Cunning Acquisition of Aircraft for Flight to Britain Truth Revealed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nuremberg, 21st] German aircraft design expert Messerschmitt, who is currently being held in Nuremberg to testify at the trial, recently disclosed the circumstances under which former Nazi Deputy Führer Hess fraudulently obtained an aircraft from him in 1941 to travel to Britain. According to him, in late autumn of 1940, Hess suddenly came to Augsburg and said that he intended to test Messerschmitt's new fighter jet. Messerschmitt refused because of Hess's important position and the significant consequences if something were to happen. However, Hess insisted and said that he was requesting it in his capacity as Deputy Führer and leader of the German youth, and that his request must be granted. In the end, Messerschmitt complied and provided him with an ME-110 aircraft for test flights. Hess's flying skills were indeed excellent. He flew the aircraft from the Augsburg airport, making 20 test flights. However, after each flight, he would criticize the aircraft's shortcomings and order Messerschmitt to find ways to improve it. His intention was to have an ideal aircraft for flying to Britain. After many test flights, Messerschmitt finally designed a perfect aircraft for him. In one conversation, Hess also inquired about how to destroy the aircraft if it was forced to land in enemy territory, and Messerschmitt naturally told him everything he knew. It was not until Hess landed in Scotland on the night of May 10, 1941, that Messerschmitt realized that Hess had already intended to fly to Britain during the test flights.</p>
<h3>Philippine President's Plane Missing; US Aircraft Launch Large-Scale Search; Roxas Orders Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 22nd] Philippine President Roxas's private plane, the "Lili Marlene," has not reached its destination four days after flying from Buac Airport here to Payagulong last Sunday. It is reported to have gone missing north of Tagum, Davao, Mindanao. About twenty US Army and Navy rescue aircraft were dispatched today to conduct a large-scale search. Philippine Airlines commercial aircraft searched all day yesterday. The plane was carrying at least twelve diplomats and government officials and eight crew members. Roxas has ordered a recount of the number of people on board. The aircraft is a C-53 giant aircraft, originally owned by Indian Governor Mountbatten, and later sold to Roxas. It was originally intended to fly to Paris to transport Vice President Quirino and his entourage back to the country. At the same time, in New York, Quirino expressed his regret for the disappearance of the aircraft. Quirino was originally scheduled to fly to London on the 27th to establish the Philippine Embassy there, but has now changed his plans to await President Roxas's orders.</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 22nd] A pilot of Philippine Airlines reported today that he had discovered the wreckage of an aircraft on a mountainside 8,700 feet high, east of Tangsalan in central Mindanao, which may be the missing aircraft of President Roxas. The fuselage was burned, and there were no signs of anyone nearby. This information is still awaiting confirmation. At the same time, the US 13th Air Force has dispatched a second rescue team to search according to the indicated clues.</p>
<h3>Major Developments Soon in British Domestic Political Situation; Internal Split in Labour Party May Be Avoided</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 21st] Two key members of the British Labour government, Foreign Secretary Bevin and Lord President of the Council Morrison, have returned here after being away from London for several weeks, respectively from Moscow and Monte Carlo. Therefore, it is expected that there will soon be major developments in the domestic political situation. Morrison's influence within the Labour Party may now be stronger than in the past. During his absence from London, the Labour Party experienced internal divisions and unrest, so many believe that if Morrison can lead the House of Commons and manage the Labour Party organization, he will be able to avoid it. Conversely, although Bevin achieved little in Moscow and is unlikely to gain the support of the people, his health is better than before, while Morrison's health has deteriorated. Therefore, it is expected that Bevin may be able to obtain a decisive voice in the future.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 21st] Five district Labour Party officials resolved today to demand that the party congress condemn US aid to Greece and Turkey as an act that "threatens world peace" and urged an investigation into whether this violates the UN Charter. This resolution must pass the agenda committee and be seconded by a sufficient number of people before it can be submitted to the congress for discussion.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 21st] The Labour Party will hold its annual congress in Margate, on the coast of Betts, next week. To prevent left-wingers from attacking it at that time, the Labour Party released a booklet today defending Bevin's foreign policy, stating: The Labour government does not intend to side with either the US or the Soviet Union, so as not to trigger a third world war. However, under no circumstances can Britain pursue a policy that leads to war with the US. Therefore, if the Soviet Union comes into conflict with the US, Britain cannot be its ally. The purpose of the Anglo-American understanding is to avoid war. As long as Britain plays a decisive role in US security and defense, the US cannot pursue a global aggression policy without British consent.</p>
<h3>US Army Magazine Advocates Moving Industries Underground</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] The "Armor Cavalry" magazine published an article on the 21st by Army Department intelligence expert Classmann, strongly advocating for immediate preparations to move strategic US industries underground to prevent atomic war. Although the magazine is not an official US Army Department magazine, it often represents the trends of Army thought. The Army Air Corps recently revealed the results of its research, stating that Japan achieved significant success by moving its aircraft manufacturing industry underground during the war, beyond the range of US bombing. Most of the underground factories were in the mountains.</p>
<h3>Soviet Army Chief of Staff Temporarily Declines Invitation to Visit Britain</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 21st] The Army Department announced that Soviet Army Chief of Staff Vasilyevsky has declined the invitation to visit Britain in June due to heavy workload.</p>
<h3>International Human Rights Conference to Be Held in Britain Next Month</h3>
<p>[British Information Services, London, 22nd] The most important international human rights conference in modern history, seeking justice and truth, will be held in London from the 13th to the 16th of next month.</p>
<h3>Our Country Sends Representatives to International Telecommunications Conference</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The International Telecommunications Conference officially opened in New York on the 15th of this month. Our delegation consists of eight representatives, seven of whom departed for the United States at the beginning of the month. The remaining representative, Zhu Qiqing, also departed from Shanghai by plane this morning. According to information from the Directorate General of Telecommunications: The allocation of radio frequencies in our country is extremely disorganized. Specialized radio stations, military radio stations, and privately established radio stations across various regions either fail to follow legal registration procedures and freely adopt frequencies, or they possess inferior equipment and emit unstable frequencies, frequently causing domestic and international communication interference. International interference, in particular, often leads to inquiries and reproaches from foreign countries, which seriously damages our nation's reputation. Our delegation attending this conference feels greatly troubled by these criticisms. It is deeply hoped that all specialized, military, and private radio stations in our country can follow legal procedures, register with the Ministry of Communications, use designated frequencies, and inspect their equipment to reduce domestic and international radio communication interference, thereby enhancing our country's international reputation.</p>

<h3>Instigators of Strikes and Class Boycotts Will Be Prosecuted According to Martial Law; Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan Agree on Four Measures; Hoping Youth Will Use Reason to Solve Problems</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Due to the recent surge of student unrest in this city, which has greatly impacted public security, Mayor Wu, after consulting with Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu yesterday, announced the following four measures based on existing national laws:</p>
<p>(1) Anyone who instigates strikes or class boycotts, regardless of their identity, may be reported to the relevant sub-bureau or the Garrison Headquarters by factory owners, shopkeepers, workers, or merchants and prosecuted according to Article 9 of martial law.</p>
<p>(2) Students who do not belong to a particular school and go to various schools to promote propaganda or deliver speeches may be refused entry by the school authorities. Those who refuse to comply may be reported to the relevant sub-bureau and prosecuted for obstructing public duties and disturbing public order.</p>
<p>(3) Those who occupy school property and prevent the school from using it will be ordered to vacate by the school authorities. Those who refuse to vacate may be reported by the school authorities to the relevant sub-bureau and prosecuted for obstructing public duties and trespassing.</p>
<p>(4) Students who voluntarily wish to attend classes may apply to the school authorities, who will then request protection from the relevant sub-bureau. Those who prevent the aforementioned students from resuming classes may be reported by the school authorities or students to the relevant sub-bureau and prosecuted for obstructing freedom.</p>
<h3>Mayor Analyzes the Inside Story of the Student Unrest</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu stated when receiving reporters at 5 PM last night: The unanimous desire of Shanghai citizens at present is for stable order. The surge of student unrest has caused significant impact on society, which is regrettable. I have always been extremely protective of young students. However, after analyzing the content of the recent student unrest in this city, I have reached the following conclusions: (1) Recently, schools in this city have initiated class boycotts due to different issues. Just when efforts are being made to seek solutions through reasonable channels, new incidents occur, making it impossible for the municipal government to gradually resolve the issues according to the original plan. (2) The actions of the students in various schools were originally innocent and commendable, but the actions of a few students have gone beyond the bounds of the law. For example, students of Jinan University surrounded the residence of the president, causing the president's wife to be startled and jump out of the window, falling and getting injured; students of Datong University went to the president's residence to post slogans and overturn furniture; students of Jiaotong University took the liberty of starting a train, etc., all of which are violations of the law.</p>
<p>A Few Individuals Misuse Names</p>
<p>(3) The same phenomenon has occurred in student unrest across the country, which is that a few people misuse the names of the masses. For example, the total number of students at Jiaotong University is 3,000, but only 1,100 people went to the station that day to prepare to petition in Beijing (this was the statistic obtained when voting in the train the next morning). It is evident that the majority of 1,900 students opposed going to Beijing, but a few individuals arbitrarily acted in the name of all the students, which is completely unreasonable. (4) Based on the points listed above, it is clear that someone is attempting to use students as tools for causing chaos, which is very obvious. Recently, people have been forcibly going to various schools to give public speeches, attempting to incite class boycotts, market strikes, and labor strikes in other schools, which has already exceeded the students' own demands.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu further emphasized that the prayer of the city's four million citizens is for stability. If market and labor strikes were to materialize, the losses to the citizens would be unimaginable. Under these circumstances, the municipal government had no choice but to discuss and agree on the aforementioned measures with the Garrison Headquarters for strict implementation. These measures were originally formulated based on national laws. Anyone who opposes them is undemocratic, fails to respect the freedom of others, and clearly violates laws and discipline.</p>
<p>Mayor Expresses Four Wishes</p>
<p>Mayor Wu concluded by expressing four wishes: (1) For students - hoping that they can use reason to solve problems. Most students are pure and lovely and should have a law-abiding spirit, serving as role models for citizens and pioneers of true democracy. (2) For parents - parents should bear a heavy responsibility for the cultivation of youth. They should each advise their children to abide by the law and pay attention to all their children's actions on a daily basis. (3) For society - good people are generally afraid of trouble, but the more they are afraid of trouble, the more incidents occur. Therefore, it is hoped that people in society can not be afraid of trouble, rigorously report those who commit crimes, and pledge to be the government's strong support. (4) For ambitious individuals - youth are the future masters of the nation and the nation's most precious asset. Do not use youth as tools for causing chaos.</p>
<h3>The Communist Party Plans to Incite Middle and Elementary School Strikes; Military and Police Authorities Are Taking Strict Precautions</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Communist Party and its peripheral elements have recently planned to once again use students, preparing to take action starting today. At the same time, they are planning to incite middle and elementary school students throughout the city to participate, in order to further expand the incident and forcibly make students from different schools join strike marches. The authorities in this city have made all necessary preparations for this matter. In case of any disturbance, it is said that the military and police authorities are determined to protect the millions of citizens' shops and hope that the industrial and commercial sectors will not be fooled and create unnecessary panic.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the municipal authorities, in view of the fact that many of the students in this student unrest were being manipulated, the mayor will convene the parents of the students today to give them instructions, hoping that they can restrain their children, focus on their studies, and not be used by malicious people, leading to unnecessary sacrifices. If similar situations occur in the future and anyone willingly steps into the legal trap, the military and police authorities will arrest them all on the charge of disturbing public order without leniency.</p>
<h3>Student Brawl Case to Be Investigated Again Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] As a minor episode in the midst of student unrest, the incident of students from Shanghai Law College beating each other has been transferred by the police bureau to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation on charges of assault.

<h3>Killed Aunt The Murderer Only Feigns Insanity Verified As Mentally Normal Cai Gongda Is Indicted</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Cai Gongda, the owner of a tailor shop at 1181 Beijing West Road, was investigated several times by District Prosecutor Shen Zushou for the case of killing his cousin Cai Genyu. During questioning, Cai often gave irrelevant answers, seemingly suffering from a mental illness. According to his confession: "The reason for the killing was that Cai Genyu provoked the feelings between me and my wife, causing the relationship between me and my wife to break down. One day, I took cod liver oil pills and felt a strange taste in them. I suspected that Cai Genyu had put poison in them to harm me, which aroused my intention to kill." After Prosecutor Shen ordered a forensic examination, it was proven that he was mentally normal and purely feigning insanity. Therefore, he was indicted on the charge of murder under Article 271, Section 1 of the Criminal Code.</p>

<h3>Woolen Thread Embroidered MacArthur's Giant Portrait Representatives of Chinese Newspapers Jointly Present Souvenir</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Representatives of Chinese newspapers were invited by General MacArthur to visit Japan in late February of this year. During their stay in Japan, they received a warm welcome from General MacArthur. Therefore, after returning to China, they specially commissioned the Mei Yi Weaving Factory in this city to produce a giant portrait of MacArthur embroidered with woolen thread, which was jointly presented by the representatives to MacArthur as a memento and to express their gratitude. The giant portrait will be specially transported to Japan by Qian Mingnian, staff officer and paratrooper major of the Chinese Delegation to Japan, and will depart for Japan soon.</p>
<p>The portrait is 48 inches high and 36 inches wide. It was designed by Shi Jinhu, the owner of Mei Yi Weaving Factory, and embroidered by Ms. Liu Peizhen and other female workers. The whole work is matched with dozens of colors of woolen thread, which is bright and eye-catching. The embroidery took more than a month to complete, and consumed as much as ten pounds of woolen thread, making the project very large.</p>
<p>This beautiful and novel handicraft is the result of Shi's six or seven years of research before it took shape. The products are mostly chair cushions. Before the Pearl Harbor incident, it was shipped to foreign countries and was praised by people from all over the world, who ordered them one after another. The images of Roosevelt, Stalin, Churchill, Lincoln, Washington, and President Truman were embroidered one after another. The portraits of Sun Yat-sen and President Chiang Kai-shek, which are currently hanging in the National Assembly Hall of the capital and the Central Party Headquarters, are also made by Shi and Ms. Liu. Regarding the embroidery process, Shi first wrote the patterns and portraits on fine grid paper with watercolor paints, and then the female workers embroidered them on fine grid canvas according to the patterns, pressing each grid to embroider, without error, because missing a grid or embroidering the wrong grid can easily lead to distortion. When embroidering the portrait, the eyes, nose, and mouth must be embroidered first, and after the face is completed, the other parts are embroidered.</p>
<p>Mei Yi Weaving Factory is located at 457 Maoming South Road (Avenue Petain), and the retail department is located at 911 Shaanxi South Road (Avenue d'Alber). The factory currently has more than 20 female workers. During this summer season, the factory is engaged in embroidering shoe uppers. Each person can embroider about two or three pairs a day. After the embroidery is completed, it is handed over to the shoemaker to make them, and the selling price per pair is 38,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Shi and others deeply feel that embroidery portraits still need to be improved, so they are still studying carefully and plan to complete more wonderful masterpieces for overseas exhibitions. At the same time, he believes that his capital is limited and expansion is not easy, so he hopes that people from all walks of life will jointly establish a factory to show the new artistic handicraft of our country.</p>
<p>Attached is a portrait of MacArthur embroidered. Standing next to it, from left to right, are: Chen Xunnian, editor-in-chief of this newspaper and member of the visiting group to Japan; Qian Mingnian, staff officer and paratrooper major of the Chinese Delegation to Japan; Fan Houdong, reporter from the Central Photography Studio; Li Shuzeng, aide-de-camp to MacArthur; Cui Wanqiu, editor-in-chief of the China Times; Song Yuelun, reporter from the Southeast Daily.</p>

Jing'an Temple usually holds a temple fair, but due to the current unstable situation, the police bureau fears that gangsters may take the opportunity to cause trouble, so they have issued an order to prohibit it.</p>
<h3>Scalper Ring Leader: Intention to Retaliate After Arrest, Falsely Accuses Travel Agency Employee</h3>
<p>The Railway Bureau Police Department recently cracked a scalper ring led by Zhang Acai, who specialized in selling black market train tickets. According to his confession, in addition to his gang members obtaining tickets by queuing at the China Travel Service's two branch offices and train stations, it also involved a Mr. Wu, an employee of the China Travel Service, supplying them. Because scalping continues, and travelers in Shanghai suffer from it, the reporter specifically visited the Railway Police Department and the person in charge of the China Travel Service to understand the measures taken by various ticket selling agencies to crack down on scalping. It is said that the company has been established for more than 20 years and has always taken serving travelers as its duty. It has put the most effort into cracking down on scalpers. They regularly open the doors at 9:00 every morning to sell tickets in an orderly queue. When scalpers (who come to buy tickets every day) try to squeeze into the queue, Mr. Wu, who is in charge of ticketing at the company, identifies them and pulls them out, not allowing them to enter. At the same time, military police maintain order and, when evidence is found, hand them over to the military police for strict handling. Therefore, scalpers hate Mr. Wu the most, and have threatened him. This time, after the scalper ring leader Zhang Acai was arrested, he accused Mr. Wu of supplying black market tickets in order to retaliate and vent his anger. According to Zhang Acai's confession, he once handed over 4 million yuan in ticket money to Mr. Wu of the China Travel Service that day. It is found that the company sells only a small number of tickets each day, and the first-class reserved seat tickets to the farthest Nanjing station are only 30,000 yuan each. If 4 million yuan were used to buy black market tickets, it would account for almost half of the company's ticket sales. However, there are bound to be three or four thousand people who purchase tickets from passengers every day, so it is absolutely impossible in reality. However, if a small number of black market tickets are sold by the company, they are squeezed and purchased by new scalpers, which the company is really unable to prevent. It hopes that the press will visit to clarify the truth and that all sectors of society will assist. According to the Police Department, the five black market tickets seized from Zhang Acai the other day, with numbers 2236, 2241, 6186, 6169, and second-class Shanghai to Wuxi train tickets, were not sold by the China Travel Service.</p>

Now, a small number of students are holding the majority of students hostage, preventing them from attending classes. We really can't stand it anymore. We should stand up and speak out, organize a joint association of student parents, guide students, advocate justice, and stabilize society. Democracy is definitely not about pandering to the public. We hope that the press truly cares for young people and does not add fuel to the fire, sending young people into the abyss of destruction!"</p>

<h3>The Central China Academy of Art and the Second School Temporarily Suspend the Parade</h3>

<h3>The Beiping Education Association Declares Opposition: Tsinghua Professors Sympathize with the Class Boycott</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 22nd] The Beiping City Education Association recently issued a statement on the matter of Tsinghua University professors sympathizing with the student class boycott, expressing: "Recently, we read in the newspaper that more than 80 Tsinghua professors signed a statement sympathizing with the student class boycott. This association is extremely surprised. The Communist Party deceives young people, using them as tools of struggle, disregarding the loss of young people's studies, and only caring about the party's own interests. This is a fact that everyone knows. Furthermore, university students receive public funds, which is a special favor from the state. At present, most elementary school teachers are working on an empty stomach, but they all take the difficulties of the country to heart, because they deeply know that the current difficulties are due to the Communist Party's rebellion. During the government's suppression of the rebellion, only patience and determination can save the country and the nation. University professors should be scholars and great Confucian scholars, and their righteousness should always be a model for the literati. Now, they actually sympathize with the student class boycott, which is a deep concern for our education community. We dare to express our strong opposition to the signatures of the professors of Tsinghua University. If the rumors are untrue, then it is the fortune of our education community."</p>
<h3>School Presidents of Colleges and Above in This City Express Their Opinions on the Student Movement: Hoping Students Will Resume Classes Quickly and Restore Order</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The presidents of national and private colleges and universities in Shanghai held a meeting yesterday afternoon and expressed the following opinions on the current student movement: Recently, students from colleges and universities in this city have launched a large-scale class boycott movement. In terms of its motives and proposals, there is no lack of sympathy. However, the actions and attitudes they have taken are inevitably biased. In order to avoid the expansion of the situation and to find a solution so that schools can restore a harmonious and solemn atmosphere and society can maintain a stable and normal order, this association makes the following proposals: (1) One of the reasons why young people cannot study with peace of mind is that the country has not yet achieved stability. Since the government has repeatedly stated that it has never closed the door to peace, it is deeply hoped that the CCP will immediately lay down its arms and negotiate sincerely, so that the people's suffering will not be further deepened, social order can be restored, and then education can progress in an orderly manner. (2) Increasing education funding, improving teacher salaries, and student meals are consistent demands of the education community. However, using the means of a class boycott not only loses the original intention of maintaining education but also leads to more disputes. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that classes will be resumed quickly and order restored. This association is willing to do its best to promote the gradual realization of reasonable demands from young people within the scope of the government's financial capacity. (3) Each school is an independent institution and should maintain the dignity of its academic institution. Students in the school should express their opinions through legal channels and should not be interfered with by students from other schools. Recently, students from School A have formed teams and rushed into School B, posting slogans and distributing leaflets. This association has to express its serious condemnation. (4) What students are fighting for today is the realization of democracy. Everyone should have the opportunity to fully express their own will or opinions. If the resolution is passed by a majority, the minority can willingly accept it. If a meeting is held without reaching the legal quorum, or actions are taken without the approval of the majority, or even during a meeting, a few people shout and do not allow participants to freely express their opinions, then disputes will arise and inevitably run counter to the true meaning of democracy. Furthermore, in recent years, there have often been organizations claiming to be united among students in various schools. It is often impossible to prove whether the representatives who participate are elected by all the students of each school and whether the tasks they undertake are entrusted by all the students. If one claims to be a representative without legal procedures and then takes advantage of the name to issue orders, it is even more inconsistent with the spirit of democracy. (5) School systems or regulations should be implemented by the school in accordance with education laws and regulations. Whether there is a need for changes should be decided by the education administrative authorities or the school, not by students' frivolous claims. The members of this association deeply apologize for not being able to make effective communication in advance of the rise of this storm. We hope that students from various schools can calmly seek solutions to problems without competing for emotions. It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost.</p>

At that time, Mayor Wu was visiting the school for inspection, and the students immediately requested him to give a speech.

<h3>Avenge the Arrow's Revenge from Last Autumn: Zhenglun Defeats Enkas: 49 to 40; Expeditionary Force Achieves Five Wins in Five Games</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Luoyang Expeditionary Force Zhenglun Basketball Team has achieved five wins in five games, and last night defeated Enkas 49 to 40, avenging the arrow's revenge from last autumn. In the first half, Zhenglun fought hard and only led by three points, with the score being 25 to 22. The Municipal Gymnasium was extremely lively, and the 1,500 spectators were ecstatic. After the game, they were reluctant to leave. During the game, Enkas frequently committed fouls, and Zhenglun earned many penalty points. Cai Zhongqi was injured in the face in the first half and was later replaced by Cheng Fei, who also performed well. Tu Wenlong, Yu Ruizhang, and Liu Zhengjun continued to make great contributions. Enkas' V Kairos and Bowles were relatively calm, but the others played too aggressively. Their ball luck was poor in the second half, and many attempts failed. Zhenglun won with stamina. The foreign troops have not touched the ball for a long time, and Xiqing has temporarily suspended basketball because it is currently volleyball season.</p>
<p>First Half</p>
<p>Hard Battle Leads Ahead</p>
<p>Enkas arrived late. Captain Ge Pengqiguofu accepted a flag presented by Zhenglun. The game started at 7:08 PM. The referees were Chen Sailin and Zhang Wenyuan. The Zhenglun lineup was Yu Ruizhang, Cai Zhongqi, Tu Wenlong, Liu Zhengjun, and Wang Binghuan. The Enkas lineup was Bowles, Ge Pengqiguofu, E Kairos, O Chai Liao, and V Kairos. Zhenglun's Yu Ruizhang and Cai Zhongqi successively made free throws to open the scoring. Bowles scored a goal, making it 2-2. Ma Hanyi replaced Bowles. Cai, Tu, V Kairos, and Bowles attacked each other. At the 10-minute mark, Enkas led 12-9. At this time, Bowles had returned to the field. Ma Hanyi was out. Zhenglun's pairing was not working well, and they repeatedly missed good opportunities. Bowles dribbled the ball to the basket and scored. When the score was 16-15, Cai Zhongqi was unfortunately injured by Ge Pengqiguofu's slap in the face and was replaced by Cheng Fei. The opponent also replaced Ma Hanyi with E Kairos. In the chaotic situation, the score became tied at 20. Yu Ruizhang scored a goal, giving Zhenglun a two-point lead, allowing them to breathe a sigh of relief. Unexpectedly, Ma Hanyi tied the score at 22. Tu Wenlong scored a goal, and Yu Ruizhang made a free throw. The first half ended with a hard-fought victory, with Zhenglun leading by three points, 25-22. Final Victory</p>
<p>Zhenglun Team</p>

V Kairos and Bowles scored two consecutive goals. O Chai Liao committed his fifth foul. Ge Pengqiguofu returned to the game, 40-31. V Kairos was fouled out, and Frank came on.

<h3>Table Tennis League: Xin Sheng Hong Benefits from Misfortune</h3>
<p>In the table tennis league, the four games the other night, the game between Team Three of Zhao and Team Xin Sheng Hong of Division One was the most tense.

However, that night, Zhao Yi's Zhang Luobang and Tan Hongda could have won but didn't, resulting in a 3-4 loss to Xin Sheng Hong, who therefore benefited from misfortune.</p>

<h3>National Martial Arts Included in National Games Championship: Beijing Martial Arts Circles Send Letter to National Games Organizing Committee Requesting</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing] Zhu Guoxiang, a teacher at National Central University in Nanjing, and over fifty members of the martial arts community, have sent a letter to the National Games Organizing Committee requesting that martial arts be included in the National Games as a championship event. The letter states: "Having read in the newspapers that the first preparatory meeting for the Seventh National Games has listed martial arts as a performance event but not as a championship, this decision seems inappropriate. Previous National Games have included martial arts as one of the championship events, including boxing, weapons, wrestling, archery, slingshot, shuttlecock kicking, and strength testing. Among these seven items, we believe that martial arts is the most meaningful and historical national sport in our country. At the previous Games, representatives from Mongolia were invited to perform wrestling, which attracted the attention of the general public. After careful consideration, we urge your committee to include martial arts as one of the official championships. The reasons are as follows: (1) Martial arts is a traditional sport in our country, and practitioners across the country are exceptionally widespread. Other countries strongly promote their own traditional sports. The fact that the current National Games only lists martial arts as a performance is clearly inconsistent with the central government's repeated pronouncements to promote martial arts. (2) Martial arts, like other sports, has its own competitive significance. It is not only a high-intensity exercise but also a life skill that can be applied. It should be actively promoted for its widespread use. (3) It is unfair that table tennis is included as an official championship event, while the traditional martial arts are only listed as a performance event."</p>
<h3>Local Martial Arts Community to Hold Symposium Today</h3>
<p>The Seventh National Games will be held this Double Tenth Festival. The local martial arts community is holding a symposium at the Municipal Gymnasium conference room on Shaanxi South Road at 7:30 PM today to discuss whether to request the National Games to add martial arts championships and to promote and revive martial arts in the future. Martial arts masters Tong Zhongyi, Zhang Qidong, Tang Huang, Wang Yiqiao, Wang Huaiqi, and others will attend to discuss.</p>
<h3>Memorial Service Decided to Be Held on June 15th</h3>

<h3>Municipal Elementary School Friendship Association Holds First Friendship Cup Tournament</h3>

The tournament includes five sports: basketball, table tennis, volleyball, badminton, and tennis. The badminton competition will be held at the No. 11 District Central National School (i.e., He'an Elementary School on Xinzhai Road) starting at 5:00 PM today, with the No. 15 District Central Team playing against the No. 5 District No. 1 Central Team, and Cang Jiji playing against the No. 11 District Central Team. All municipal elementary school colleagues are welcome to attend.</p>
<h3>Reviewing Zheng Lun</h3>
<p>Zheng Lun's fifth battle in Shanghai against Encas, this game was known to be worth watching. After several games, a definite understanding of Zheng Lun's advantages has been gained: stamina, speed, and shooting accuracy.</p>
<p>But the first two advantages against Encas were of no use, because Encas also had extraordinary stamina and speed. Zheng Lun was able to maintain its victory last night for one reason only, which was that its shooting skills surpassed Encas'.</p>
<p>Zheng Lun still has undeniable weaknesses: passing skills need improvement, and control of the ball under the basket lacks precision. Especially when attacking the enemy's basket, after a missed shot, the ball falls into Encas' hands. Tu Wenlong is the center of Zheng Lun's team. He is quick-witted, shoots accurately, and has a naturally gifted physique. The new player, Cheng Fei, is flexible and has a promising future.</p>
<p>I believe that Zheng Lun still has many shortcomings, which is a cause for optimism; strength and speed are innate, not advantages, while the basic techniques of basketball, Zheng Lun, except for shooting, has not yet reached the pure heat. I believe that with each game they play, they can "absorb" something new, making progress every day. (Changnian)</p>

<h3>Striving to Cooperate with Government Policies: Four Banks to Implement In-Kind Loans: Vice Chairman Zhang Attends Board Meeting for the First Time and Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>[United Credit Information Service, Nanjing, 6:00 PM on the 22nd] The position of Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Four Banks has been assigned by the National Government to the current Premier of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Qun. Mr. Zhang attended the 344th Board Meeting of the organization for the first time this morning. Those present included Directors Yu Hongjun, Zhang Jia'ao, Weng Wenhao, Song Hanzhang, Qian Yongming, Chen Guofu, Zhao Jianhua, Li Shuming, Huo Saite, Chen Xing, Pang Songzhou, Tan Boyu, Secretary-General Xu Boyuan, Director Wu Rencang, Director Gu Chunfan, General Manager Shou Miancheng, and others. The meeting began at 9:00 AM. Mr. Zhang delivered a speech, stating that the main business of the Four Banks is to unite the strength of various banks and bureaus, to cooperate with the government's financial policies, and to assist in the development of production enterprises. The Four Banks have made many contributions during the war of resistance, and should continue to work hard to meet the needs of post-war reconstruction. Mr. Zhang also gave a comprehensive explanation of the current financial situation, hoping that loan business should focus on key areas and take the initiative to better fit the national policy. Subsequently, the meeting discussed the Secretariat's report on the past loan approval situation and future policies of the organization. The directors all expressed their opinions successively, discussing for about two hours. The scope of various loans approved by the organization over the years has not gone beyond the following four items:</p>
<p>(1) Those related to national economic construction;</p>
<p>(2) Those related to social people's livelihood;</p>
<p>(3) Those related to promoting foreign exchange earnings;</p>
<p>(4) Other matters that should be assisted to cooperate with national policies.</p>
<p>In the future, to assist the government in controlling materials and stabilizing prices, the organization will consider piloting in-kind loans and in-kind recovery methods, or using order methods, to supply funds to certain private industrial and mining enterprises. This active method will be submitted to the Loan and Agricultural Loan Subcommittee for separate research and then reviewed and approved.</p>
<p>In addition, the Jiangzhe District spring silkworm cocoon loan was previously approved for 120 billion yuan. Because the cocoon price has increased, the organization, in order to assist in completing this year's silk reeling plan, has approved an increase of 80 billion yuan to the above loan amount, for a total of 200 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Unfavorable Swap Situation Leads to Abrupt Price Drop in Yongsha Shares</h3>
<p>The Chinese stock market initially showed a slight upward trend yesterday, but due to an unfavorable swap situation, many parties sold at high prices, and new buyers did not follow. Rumors of unfavorable sentiment towards buyers remained strong. Near noon, Yongsha shares suddenly experienced a sharp decline, with the immediate delivery Yongsha shares suffering the most significant drop, causing the swap spread to widen further. Yongsha is scheduled to hold a board meeting on the 25th. There are increasing rumors in the market about capital increases, and some even speculate whether buying and selling will be temporarily suspended if Yongsha actually implements a capital increase. It is said that the Guangdong group strongly advocates stopping trading, but the exchange, for revenue considerations, is rumored not to accept it. This move has a significant impact on short squeezes, long squeezes, and the prospects of miscellaneous second-tier stocks.</p>
<p>The morning began with a weak market due to the unfavorable swap situation. However, the forward Yongsha shares disregarded everything, opening high at 7,500 yuan. After the opening, Nos. 213, 31, 169, 106, and 76 sold off, briefly pushing the forward Yongsha shares down to 7,370 yuan. Nos. 141, 205, 218, and 79 all entered the market, leading to a peculiar shortage on the trading floor and a rebound to 7,730 yuan. Nos. 61, 148, 105, 164, 224, and 152 all sold off, retreating to within 7,500 yuan. Nos. 223, 14, 143, 94, 148, 17, and 78 entered the market, while Nos. 35 and 61 bought spot Yongsha shares, pushing the price up to 7,800 yuan. No. 180, 224, and 78 sold off, bringing the price down to 7,650 yuan. Nos. 106 and 155 maintained strong buying interest, pushing the price up to 7,850 yuan. Nos. 153, 89, 32, 655, 83, and 12 sold off, and after 11:30 AM, the market gradually became unsustainable. Nos. 24, 223, and 36 also sold off, and by 11:50 AM, the price had fallen to 7,350 yuan. Nos. 155, 65, 232, 14, 218, and 36 entered the market at 7,600 yuan, but thereafter the situation worsened. Rumors favored buying, and Nos. 76, 197, 89, 153, 223, 160, and 235 all sold off, with scattered long positions selling off urgently. No. 83 even cut losses on immediate delivery Yongsha shares. In the afternoon, the forward Yongsha shares were pushed down to 7,050 yuan. No. 141 and others made slight purchases, and the afternoon closing price rose to 7,120 yuan. After the close, the market appeared hesitant, and Meiya and Yonggong shares had reportedly fallen to their limit. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, Yongsha, Xinguang, and Qinxing shares each fell by more than 50%, Jingfu, Xinhe, Xinhua, and Yonggong shares each fell by more than 10%, and Meiya shares fell to their limit. For forward delivery, there was only half a day of trading the previous day, so Yongsha shares fell slightly, Qinxing shares rose slightly, Xinhe, Xinguang, and Jingfu shares each fell by more than 50%, and Meiya and Yonggong shares each fell by 10%. For cold stocks, China France Goods rose to their limit, while China Textile, Tongyi, China Silk, Firewood, and Cement shares each fell by about 10%, Datong shares fell by 50%, and other stocks generally fell by about 50%. In the over-the-counter market, Zhabei shares rose by 10%, World shares fell by 10%, and other stocks experienced mixed price movements.</p>
<p>Yesterday, arbitrage transactions for spot and forward delivery shares saw a reduction in funds from the financial sector, but only Nos. 8 and 9 large long positions posted orders. Trading was not active. Yongsha shares opened at 450 yuan, fell to 400 yuan, then gradually rose to 560 yuan, and closed at 550 yuan. Meiya shares opened at 2,200 yuan, rose from 2,000 yuan to close at 2,500 yuan. Xinhe shares retreated from 280 yuan to 220 yuan, and closed at 260 yuan. Small-cap stocks ranged from 10 yuan to 13 yuan, and the combined interest rate ranged from 2 jiao 2 fen to 3 jiao 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Mediocre, Foreign Stocks Hesitant</h3>
<p>Government bonds were mediocre and slightly weak yesterday. Unified Ding bonds were relatively stable, with only over 4 million in transactions. Unified Bing bonds opened at 14,500 yuan, fell to 13,800 yuan, and then stabilized. Rooms 550 and 360 had sales. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, Jia and Yi bonds fell by 600 yuan, Bing bonds fell by 800 yuan, Unified Ding bonds remained flat, and Unified Wu bonds also fell by 300 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were also hesitant yesterday. The price fluctuations of various stocks were minor. The Guangdong group absorbed small-cap stocks, while foreign firms focused on British Union. Securities firms remained willing to sell, so the process lacked progress. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, Yibier and Paper shares rose slightly, Huidfeng and Zhi remained flat, Yisha and Shipping shares each fell by about 50%, and other stocks generally fell slightly.</p>
<h3>Rayon Shouts High, Factory-Run Silk Goods Downstream</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rayon market saw the China Trust Bureau extending the deadline for silk weaving industry allocations to the end of the week, leading to a tight supply of chips in the market and a shift in sentiment. No. 120, Gaoshan Youguang, opened at 17 million yuan and closed up 100,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the asking price rose by another 100,000 yuan, eventually reaching 17.2 million yuan, up 300,000 yuan from the previous day. Dongyang and Jin Sanma, etc., also followed suit. Semi-gloss No. 75 was ignored. Yesterday's market still shouted the original plate from the previous day. The factory-run silk goods market yesterday faced a very thin appetite from the silk factories, creating an imbalance between supply and demand, and the asking price continued downstream. The transaction price for grade A was 20.7 million yuan, grade C opened at 20.2 million yuan, and grade E was 19.5 million yuan, all down 300,000 yuan from the previous day, with extremely low transaction volume. Dry silk was ignored, and the asking price did not fluctuate much.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk goods market was generally stable, except for price silk bedding and plaid crepe, which were slightly short. Meiya bedding was quoted at 8.6 million yuan, down 100,000 yuan from the previous day, with no transactions. Dacheng plaid Fengqu took the lead at 31,700 yuan, but due to the emergence of multiple parties, the asking price gradually decreased, and finally sold for 1,300 yuan. The next day, the asking price was 1,600 yuan, which was 700 yuan less than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Silk and Satin Transportation and Printing</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] It is learned that approximately 20,000 pieces of export silk and satin produced by the Silk Weaving Joint Venture Company have been shipped in three batches and have now all been declared for import. It was previously rumored that India intended to ban the import of foreign silk after the end of June this year. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now instructing our ambassador to India to investigate this matter in detail. It is heard that the United States has also expressed disagreement with India's move. If the rumor is true, diplomatic channels will be used to seek a reasonable solution.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Turns Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market turned firm, mainly because there was a strong call to lift restrictions on the circulation of yarn and cloth. If it becomes possible to lift the restrictions, yarn prices are expected to rise, so sentiment has improved and there has been a slight replenishment in the market. 42-count blue [brand name] opened at 11.8 million yuan, then gradually rose, and finally reached 12.1 million yuan, up 200,000 yuan from the previous day. 20-count special double horse was 7.15 million yuan, up 250,000 yuan. Double horse yarn rose from 6.65 million yuan to 700,000 yuan at the close, also up 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. Other yarns all rose by 50,000 yuan to 200,000 to 300,000 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Summer Cotton Cloth Shows Sales</h3>
<p>In the cotton cloth market, due to rumors the previous day that there would be restrictions on mobility in North China, customers generally held a wait-and-see attitude, and purchases in this street were also sluggish. Therefore, 12-pound Longtou fine cloth retreated slightly to 288,009 yuan, and was still less accepted. Later, people in the industry believed that the news of restrictions in North China was untrue, and instead there were rumors of high sales, and sentiment in the market suddenly stabilized. This defense has purchased summer cloth, and as a result, various bridge bleached cloths have risen by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Longtou fine cloth rose by 2,000 yuan to 295,000 yuan, while jump [brand name] serge and Yuangong satin, etc., increased. Other Shilin cloths fell by about 10,000 yuan. Blue cloth fell by 10,000 yuan to 25,000 yuan, while coarse cloth, fine cloth, and palace cloth, etc., mostly saw declines.</p>
<h3>Soap and Candle Raw Materials Fall, Caustic Soda Plunges 600,000</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the raw materials for soap and candles saw a drop due to the arrival of goods from Hong Kong and the dumping by foreign firms, causing the market price to steadily fall. Monthly brand caustic soda fell to 7 million yuan, a sharp drop of 600,000 yuan, and American goods also followed suit, falling to 6.9 million yuan. Caustic soda powder fell from 2,000 yuan per pound to 1,800 yuan, and Siding fell by 200,000 yuan to 3 million yuan. The prices of other coconut oil, vanilla rosin, and white wax, etc., remained stable.</p>
<h3>Xiangmao Distributes Goods</h3>
<p>China Soap Company previously distributed MC and MO grades of yellow and white Xiangmao soap to fellow traders. The company stipulated that the deadline for payment was the 21st. Now, because each household of traders has to pay 820,000 yuan in cash for this time, the procedure for checking banknotes is quite slow, and quite a few traders have not yet paid. The company has now specially extended the payment deadline to tomorrow (Saturday) to clear payments and complete the procedures for receiving goods.</p>
<h3>Rice Arrivals Scarce, Market Continues to Rise, High-Quality White Japonica Rice Made a New Price of 340,000 Yuan Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Rice arrivals were scarce yesterday, totaling 6,384 shi. Rice merchants had good inventory and the market was active, and the market continued to rise, rising another 10,000 to 20,000 yuan from the previous day. High-quality white japonica rice was traded at 335,000 yuan in the southern market and made a new high price of 340,000 yuan in the northern market. A portion of the Siamese rice allocated by the Social Affairs Bureau to rice merchants who had already paid taxes was shipped out yesterday. Of this, 40% was broken rice, which is often mixed with good rice and sold separately in various districts during the day.</p>
<p>Also reported: Flour continued to fall in the mainland and was therefore sluggish, falling by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Bran was supplied by the factories as usual, with sales moving without stagnation, and prices were stable. Northeastern soybean cake continued to arrive, with rural sales slightly moving, and the market was stable. Yellow beans remained flat, green beans had few customers, and fell by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Red sorghum continued to rise by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and red beans had separate movements, rebounding by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were similar, sesame seeds from Tianjin and Zhuang had a market, and rose by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. The new season of broad beans will arrive in Shanghai soon, and the market is trending softer. Northern corn dealers are still vigorously collecting corn, and it continues to soar by 15,000 to 16,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Various kinds of oil had arrivals, with idle digestion. Soybean oil fell sharply by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, pure oil continued to fall by 20,000 yuan, and crude oil also fell by more than 10,000 yuan. Sesame oil fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil fell by another 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[Also reported] A large amount of rice arrived in Shanghai. The Philippine ship Kasai Bockney, represented by Fu Lai Shipping Company, arrived yesterday morning, transporting more than 40,000 bags of rice from Siam, and is now berthed at buoys Nos. 4 and 5 for unloading.</p>
<h3>Peruvian Sugar Prices Negotiated, Set at 430,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>A large amount of Peruvian sugar is stored in various warehouses in this city. To prevent it from flowing into the black market, the Sugar Association decided to follow the order of the Social Affairs Bureau to complete registration procedures and prepare a cost calculation table, which was submitted to yesterday's Price Review Committee Sugar Group meeting for discussion. The price was agreed to be 430,000 yuan per 100 pounds, and cash transactions were used as a standard. Those who can transfer warehouse receipts will be given a discount as usual. However, supply should be maximized and all of it should be sold to the market, and hoarding and speculation are strictly prohibited.</p>
<h3>Hardware Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the hardware market was stagnant again. Western nails fell slightly, and actual sales were average. Various goods were unable to increase in price.</p>
<h3>South China Establishes a Special Import and Export Management Committee to Prevent Smuggling and Control Trade</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Executive Committee of the Temporary Import Management Committee held its 32nd regular meeting on May 21st. Director Xu Fengzao of the Xiamen District Office came to Shanghai to attend and report on the local implementation of import management. It is learned that the matters raised by the district for discussion and resolution are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) The distribution of the second-quarter quota for imported goods in the Xiamen district shall be handled by Director Xu in consultation with the Distribution Department and the Non-Quota Examination Department.</p>
<p>(B) The Fuzhou and Xiamen Chamber of Commerce requested to issue temporary permits and allow foreign exchange settlement in accordance with the Guangzhou and Shantou practices. It was resolved that since the South China region has already stipulated quotas, it should be handled in accordance with the trade regulations and no temporary permits will be issued.</p>
<p>(C) Regarding the import of goods donated by overseas Chinese to schools, social organizations, and institutions in the Xiamen district, it was resolved that it should be handled in accordance with the decision of the 23rd meeting of this committee. In addition, the Executive Committee resolved to hire Mr. Lin Jiyong as a consultant to the committee and retroactively approved the following two cases:</p>
<p>(1) The Guangzhou Import and Export Association proposed that due to rampant smuggling in South China and overlapping crises, a South China Import and Export Management Committee should be established to coordinate import and export trade matters.</p>
<p>(2) The Guangzhou Import and Export Association proposed a draft plan for the import of raw materials for export products. It is heard that the above two cases have been submitted by Director Zhang to the National Economic Commission for approval.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Bond Fund to Be Deposited in New York Bank of China, Short-Term Treasury Bill Collateral Planned</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Mr. Li [name], Director of the Supervision Committee of the 36-Year US Dollar Bond Fund, recently discussed the issues of short-term treasury bills, US dollar public prices, fund, and collateral with reporters as follows:</p>
<p>(1) (Question) Has the short-term treasury bill fund collateral been determined, and what is the valuation situation? (Answer) The designation of this collateral was previously discussed at a meeting convened by the Ministry of Finance, following the order of the Executive Yuan, inviting representatives from the Economic Department Investment Committee, the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau, and the Bond Fund Supervision Committee. It was resolved to formulate a plan to designate eight units, including Fangjian, China Silk, China Tobacco, Aquatic Products, various companies, Defu Foreign Firm, Bayer Factory, enemy and puppet warehouses and docks, and enemy and puppet real estate, as well as the Economic Department's other business investment shares. The valuation has been completed, and the ministry will submit it to the government for designated announcement.</p>
<p>(2) (Question) Has the US dollar debt repayment fund been issued, and where is it stored? (Answer) According to the organizational regulations of the Supervision Committee, the financial institution where the US dollar bond fund is deposited should be designated by the Supervision Committee. Currently, the fact that this designation should not be restricted by the "Public Treasury Law" is being submitted to the government for approval. Once this point is approved, the Supervision Committee will formally designate the place of deposit. The Central Bank can then allocate the first installment of principal and interest to the Supervision Committee in full in accordance with the regulations. The place of deposit is likely to be the Bank of China in New York.</p>
<p>(3) (Question) When can the preferential interest short-term treasury bills be issued? (Answer) I went to Wuhan in the beginning of this month and only returned to Shanghai yesterday. Regarding the issuance of preferential interest short-term treasury bills, I have only seen the news and discussions in the newspapers. I have not heard anything else. As of now, it still seems to be a suggestion. This matter has a significant impact on the overall financial relationship. In my opinion, it needs to be carefully studied, weighing the advantages and disadvantages, and it should not be easily attempted.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Market Turns Promising</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market turned promising. Cigarettes from the Yizhong Company were selling very well, and fellow traders frequently requested additional supplies, leading to higher asking prices. The sales of Chinese cigarettes were average. The Morning Pass British Brand opened at 7.4 million, then gradually rose to a high price of 7.7 million yuan. Old Knife gradually rose from 6.65 million yuan to over 6.7 million yuan. Due to fellow traders from other cities selling off at high prices, the market slightly retreated.</p>
<p>At the midday close, British cigarettes stood at 7.5 million yuan, and Old Knife had supplies for sale at 6.68 million yuan. In the afternoon, there was a slight profit-taking release, causing British cigarettes to retreat by 200,000 yuan, resulting in a price of 7.3 million yuan, up 10,000 yuan from the previous day. Old Knife was 6.675 million yuan, up 45,000 yuan. Other Chinese cigarettes had mixed price movements.</p>
<p>[Also reported] Yesterday, the tip cigarette footing remained firm. Chariot sold for between 55,500 yuan and 6,000 yuan. 50-stick Three Cannon was even more promising, and it was heard that it was difficult to buy in even at a price of 32,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[Also reported] The asking price for the Beauty Brand cigarette was hovering around 40,000 yuan per carton before 9:00 AM. Around 9:30 AM, due to the issuance of a distribution announcement by the Huacheng Tobacco Company, Beauty Brand cigarettes were allocated, with two cartons of A card, one carton of B card, and 40 cartons of C card, with a distribution price of 3.8 million yuan per carton. At that time, there were many supplies for sale in the market, but buyers needed to pass the 40,000 yuan mark, and they seemed willing to enter the market at 37,000 to 8,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Chambers of Commerce and Industry Association Representatives Discuss Raw Material Quota Allocation Issues, Resolving Two Careful Certification Methods</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The City Chamber of Commerce and the Industry Association held a discussion with representatives from various industry associations in the city at the City Chamber of Commerce at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss the issue of the first-term quota import of industrial raw materials. Thirty to forty representatives from various industries attended, chaired by Pan Shihao. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM. The details of the process are recorded below:</p>
<p>(A) Reporting Matters: Regarding the issue of industrial raw materials, the first discussion meeting was held on the 5th of this month, and five methods were resolved.</p>
<p>(B) Discussion Matters: (1) Regarding the certification of approved imported raw materials before the end of January, three methods have been decided and announced to the various associations for compliance. However, the Import and Export Management Committee is about to begin allocating the first-term quota for imported industrial raw materials. Please discuss and decide how the associations should comprehensively and carefully certify in the future to prevent abuses.</p>
<p>Resolution: From now on, for the raw materials required by various factories, if they have applied to the Import and Export Management Committee or signed a purchase contract with importers before January 30th of this year and have been approved for import, certification will be granted. However, when certifying, member manufacturers must first sell the certificate, provide documents, and pledge to abide by the following two items: (1) When the association handles the entire quota allocation in the future, the above amount will be deducted from its first-term allocation. (2) If the order quantity exceeds the production capacity for three months as specified, the excess quantity may be distributed by the association to all colleagues in the industry.</p>
<h3>Government Acquisition of Export Goods Is the Current Reasonable Method</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to an export industry insider, due to the drastic fluctuations in commodity prices in various countries in the past and the large gap between domestic and international prices, the export industry has been at a standstill. Taking tung oil, a major export commodity, as an example, the domestic price is at least 50% higher than the international price. Therefore, it is a reasonable method for the government to authorize agencies to purchase export materials, unify foreign sales, and bear the losses from the national treasury at present.</p>
<h3>Business Federation Appoints Representatives to Undertake the Japanese Compensation Factory</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The National Business Federation's representatives to participate in the undertaking of the Japanese compensation factory, according to the previous proposal, are Wang Xiaolai (Shanghai), Fu Rulin (Shanghai), Jin Runxiang (Shanghai), Ge Jieshen (Shanghai), Wang [name] Zhai (Nanjing), Lu Xiaobo (Jiangsu), Zhu Huiqing (Zhejiang), and Sun Yuanfu (Anhui). The Industry and Commerce Counseling Office is scheduled to hold a meeting today to continue discussing the undertaking matters and hopes that the Industry Association and the Chamber of Commerce will submit the list of candidates from various places as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Export through Hong Kong Declines</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Hong Kong, 22nd] The export of Fujian and Taiwan tea through Hong Kong is declining. Before the war, the countries that imported Chinese tea through Hong Kong, such as Siam, Vietnam, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies, have weakened purchasing power after the war and mostly use cheaper local tea. Before the war, the quantity of Chinese tea transported to Vietnam through Hong Kong was about 100,000 pieces per year, but last year it was only 2,000 pieces. Recently, tea prices have fallen lower than last year. Ordinary packaged tea has fallen from more than 400 yuan to 110 yuan, Minbei Wuyi tea Dayan Narcissus has fallen from more than 2,000 yuan to 1,800 yuan, and Taiwan BOP black tea has fallen from 390 yuan to 130 yuan, but Anxi Tieguanyin prices are stable and still selling for 1,200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Ping Shui for Export Is Being Prepared</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market was still sluggish because the asking prices from various places could not converge. According to industry insiders, the Ping Shui tea, which is welcomed in the Americas, is being prepared in the producing area this year. However, it is heard that the cost is quite expensive, requiring more than 1 million yuan per dan. At this price, it may be difficult to meet foreign tastes, so exports may not be optimistic. The market for various domestic teas is not stagnant, and the prices of various grades are stable. However, the 35-year Zhengzhou Hongqing is considered unique due to the relationship between the buyer and seller, and the market atmosphere is rapidly developing.</p>
<h3>Fluctuations in the Pound Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>Official Price 4 Yuan, Market Price 2.5 Yuan</p>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 21st] Although British and American officials have denied the widespread rumor that the United States will provide new loans to the United Kingdom, the rumor is still rampant. Therefore, the exchange rate of the pound against the dollar has also fluctuated. The official exchange rate is four US dollars to one pound, but the market price of the pound on Wall Street is 2.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Leather Falls</h3>
<p>Leather prices have already peaked. In the past two days, due to tight credit and frequent high-level sales by cargo owners, actual sales have turned stagnant and transactions are few. Various goods have fallen rapidly.</p>

<h3>Discussion on the Mixed Use of Glucose Calcium and Vitamin C</h3>
<p>— Wang Qizhang</p>
<p>Having read Mr. Song Guobin's review of this issue in the fourth issue of this journal, and Mr. Shen Songnian's doubts about the review in the tenth issue, both have scholarly origins and unique insights, which are enlightening. Confined by my own knowledge, I would like to offer my humble contribution based on my past experience. I hope that Mr. Song and Mr. Shen will provide further guidance if there is anything appropriate.</p>
<p>The complexity of chemical synthesis and decomposition in the human body is far beyond what modern scholarship can fully understand. The saying that the human body cannot be moved into a research laboratory is precisely a puzzle before us. The premise that this issue cannot be thoroughly resolved is due to this. The benefits of calcium therapy for tuberculosis and the lack of calcium in tuberculosis patients have been known for decades and still hold a strong position in academia. However, in application, it is mostly administered non-orally to avoid complex changes in the digestive system, hence the popularity of injection methods, especially intravenous injection, as the general goal. The first requirement of calcium therapy is that the calcium must be in a soluble liquid form, and the second is to minimize irritation and avoid hemolysis. In the past thirty years, various products for intravenous injection have been improved for various therapeutic purposes. According to my knowledge, the most commonly used are the following:</p>
<p>Calcium chloride Calcium chlorat</p>
<p>Calcium lactate Calc.lact</p>
<p>Calcium benzoate Calc.benzoce</p>
<p>Calcium iodide Calc.godat</p>
<p>Calcium bromide Calc.bromat</p>
<p>Calcium salicylate Calc.salicylie</p>
<p>Calcium gluconate Calc.gluconat</p>
<p>Calcium glucono-galacto-gluconate or calc lacto-bionate</p>
<p>And many other simple or mixed products, with the important goal of obtaining a clear and colorless solution. However, the calcium required in the body's lesions is mainly in insoluble form. It is well known that various acid radicals are added to make calcium soluble for easy entry into the bloodstream, facilitating transport and avoiding thrombosis, while the ultimate need is still for insoluble calcium blocks. This is nothing more than scientists making a show of knowledge.</p>
<p>In the past thirty years, I have chemically studied calcium blocks in tissues from corpses and occasionally coughed up by patients, confirming that the main component is calcium carbonate, with occasional traces of phosphorus, as a kind of calcium salt, and not the pure calcium commonly thought. The reason is very clear. Thus, it is known that regardless of the type of calcium preparation injected into the body, it undergoes several stages of acidification as it passes through various tissues, abandoning the original acid radical and combining with carbonic acid to form insoluble calcium carbonate blocks. This is beyond doubt. We only worry that it will not be acidified, will not undergo chemical reactions, and will preserve its original solubility, leaking out of the body. However, where and how (perhaps in the lesions) carbonation and other acid radical exchange occur in the body, and whether it is gradual or sudden, I, with my limited knowledge, dare not say.</p>
<p>Mr. Song's theory of acid prohibition can be examined in two sections. If limited to the stomach, i.e., oral administration, then gastric juice is inherently acidic. If a weak acid radical or a halogen group element such as iodine is used in the salt, due to affinity, it is very likely to turn into calcium chloride. However, calcium chloride is a soluble neutral salt. If it enters the intestine and encounters an alkaline environment without any change, it can still be absorbed and achieve the purpose of calcium therapy. It does not require alcohol, beer, vinegar, coffee, sandalwood lemon, oranges, apples, tomatoes, spinach, etc., which originally contain acid, or stimulate the secretion of gastric acid, to change the original structure of the calcium preparation. Secondly, the question of how injected calcium, not through the mouth, changes in the blood seems to be greatly related to the acidity of the blood. However, physiologically, the acidity of the blood has a normal range. If, due to some disease or abnormal metabolism, the acidity of the blood exceeds the normal range, we consider it acidosis, which is not a normal physiological phenomenon. Therefore, we have no experience with compounds of citric acid, acetic acid, or tartaric acid with calcium, and we have never heard of ascorbic acid calcium. Moreover, the fact that calcium gluconate and ascorbic acid do not undergo any chemical changes after mixing in the injection syringe proves that the affinity between glucose and calcium is definitely not weaker than that of ascorbic acid, which is very clear.</p>
<p>Secondly, the question of the human body's need for calcium often gives people the feeling of excess or deficiency. However, the calcium content in the blood should be within a certain limit, and the needs of each person vary depending on various circumstances. For example, rickets and lung patients, or pregnant women, often seem to lack calcium, while the elderly and those with diseases that damage blood vessels, such as syphilis, have concerns about excessive calcium. I recall that when I was in school, Professor Katase of the Department of Pathology conducted extensive research on the problem of calcium clumping in body tissues and published many reports and papers. Unfortunately, these documents were completely lost during the Anti-Japanese War, but I remember the main idea was that when a large amount of calcium was injected into the blood of children daily, after a certain period of time, the calcium content in the blood and the calcium blocks in the whole body were examined. As a result, no abnormalities were found, only the amount of calcium excreted in the urine increased. Then, the blood of rabbits whose blood vessels or part of the body tissue had been damaged was injected with calcium in the same way, and examined after a certain period of time. Except that the calcium content in the blood remained the same, calcium blocks could be found in the damaged parts of the blood vessels and tissues. Thus, it is known that the calcium content in the blood of the human body is often constant (the report mentioned a temporary increase in calcium content, but the reason was examined immediately after the injection of calcium). Even if a large amount of calcium circulates through healthy tissues, there will be no stagnation or clumping, and the unnecessary calcium will be excreted from the body. Only the damaged blood vessels and diseased tissues will have calcium attached. As for Mr. Song's opinion that syphilis, alcohol poisoning, and the elderly do not need much calcium, or even that calcium may induce other diseases, it is completely consistent with my humble opinion.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, Mr. Song and Mr. Shen have discussed the mixed use of calcium gluconate and ascorbic acid with excessive concern and suspicion, which is completely based on the attitude of scholars and cannot be criticized. However, based on past knowledge, I have summarized and observed that the denaturation of calcium preparations in the digestive system and the differentiation in the blood are inevitable. Whether calcium gluconate still maintains its original structure when absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, and whether it still maintains its original structure when circulating in the blood, it is difficult to make a judgment lightly before it can be confirmed. However, it can be asserted that calcium gluconate and other acid-bound calcium must be denatured and decomposed to form insoluble calcium blocks before achieving the therapeutic purpose, whether in the gastrointestinal tract, in the blood, or in body tissues. What do the two gentlemen think?</p>
<h3>Infant Nutrition</h3>
<p>— Jiang Yang Minxian Zhou Deqin</p>
<p>A person's physical health is affected by two factors: one is congenital heredity, and the other is the acquired environment. Leaving aside heredity for the moment, the environmental factors that affect health, though numerous, make the problem of nutrition particularly important, as the materials for the human body's various tissues and the source of its various active forces all depend on food. Infancy is the foundation of a lifetime, and in order to cultivate a good foundation, the food of infants cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>In principle, the nutritional needs of infants and adults are not significantly different. The difference is that infants' digestive organs are not yet fully developed, so their digestive function is weaker than that of adults. At the same time, infants grow and develop extremely rapidly, so infant food must not only provide for activity and repair of various parts of the body, but also have a surplus for growth and development. Therefore, the needs of infants, in proportion to their weight, are greater than those of adults. The most suitable food:</p>
<p>Breast milk: The most suitable food</p>
<p>From birth to one year of age, the most suitable food for infants is breast milk. Breast milk has the following important advantages over other foods: (1) The composition of breast milk changes with the infant's development. The yellowish and thin milk secreted by the mother within one or two days after delivery can be used to stimulate the secretion of milk. Milk within twelve days contains less fat and more protein. Milk within one month is very rich in fat and protein. However, from one month to nine months, the fat and protein in milk gradually become thinner. After nine months, it is even more so. Therefore, breastfeeding mothers should have supplementary foods after eight or nine months to supplement the lack of nutrients in breast milk. (2) Breastfeeding does not require transportation, preparation, and other procedures, which can reduce the chance of bacterial infection. Bacteria such as tuberculosis, typhoid fever, dysentery, and cholera can often be transmitted from cow's milk. (3) The sucking action of infants is beneficial to the development of the infant's oral cavity; at the same time, breastfeeding can help the mother's uterus return to its original state. (4) Breast milk is the most economical and convenient. Therefore, infants should be breastfed whenever possible. If the mother suffers from tuberculosis, pneumonia, breast carbuncles, epilepsy, venereal disease, or other chronic diseases, she has to stop breastfeeding. If the mother suffers from acute infectious diseases, such as dysentery and scarlet fever, she can temporarily stop breastfeeding and use a breast pump to express milk every day to prevent the milk from stopping secretion. After recovery, she can continue breastfeeding. If breast milk is insufficient, it is better to add other supplementary foods to breast milk. Do not suddenly stop breastfeeding. If the mother cannot breastfeed and wants to hire a wet nurse, the following points must be paid attention to when choosing a wet nurse: (1) The wet nurse's body must be examined, and the wet nurse must be healthy and free of infectious diseases. (2) The quality and quantity of the wet nurse's milk should be suitable for the needs of the infant. For example, the milk of a late-stage wet nurse is thin and does not meet the needs of an early-stage infant. Nature and its analysis</p>
<p>Properties and Analysis of Milk Substitutes</p>
<p>Artificial feeding mostly uses fresh cow's milk, goat's milk, evaporated milk, milk powder, and specially made soy milk as food for infants. The various milk substitutes are described below:</p>
<p>(A) Fresh cow's milk Fresh cow's milk contains more protein than human milk, but less lactalbumin, and casein, which is difficult to digest, accounts for 80-90%. Moreover, the milk curd formed by cow's milk in the stomach is slightly coarser and more difficult to digest than that of human milk. Cow's milk contains less carbohydrates than human milk. The amount of minerals is more than human milk, but the copper and iron content is less than human milk, so fresh cow's milk must be prepared before it can be a suitable food for infants. The preparation method is as follows: (1) Boil for three minutes to make the protein easy to digest and have a disinfection effect. (2) Add sugar to increase the carbohydrate content. Add five grams of sugar per 100 cc of cow's milk. Sucrose or maltose (syrup) can be used. The sugar can be reduced in the seventh month. At nine months, sugar can no longer be added, because at this time, the infant can eat other carbohydrate foods. Babies with loose stools should add less sugar, and those with hard stools can add more. (3) Add water to dilute the protein.</p>
<p>(B) Whole milk powder This is made by removing water from cow's milk. If one volume is added to four volumes of water, its composition is the same as fresh milk. Suitable milk can be obtained according to the preparation method of fresh milk.</p>
<p>(C) Evaporated milk This is made by evaporating milk and reducing the water content to half. If one part of water is added to one part of evaporated milk, its composition is the same as fresh milk.</p>
<p>(D) Goat's milk The protein and carbohydrate content is the same as cow's milk, only the fat is slightly higher, but the fat globules are small and easy to digest, and goat's milk has no possibility of tuberculosis transmission. Goat's milk can be used to feed weak infants or those with allergic reactions to cow's milk.</p>
<p>(E) Milk substitute soy milk The production of cow's and goat's milk in China is insufficient, so soy milk can be used as a substitute if it cannot be purchased. Ordinary soy milk and fried soy milk must be added with salt, milk calcium, starch, and sugar to supplement their ingredients and used as milk substitutes, because the content of inorganic substances and carbohydrates in soy milk is very low. After soybeans are fried, they are easy to grind and the protein is changed, making it easy to digest, so fried soy milk is suitable for infants. Those who eat milk substitute soy milk must eat cabbage water to supplement the lack of vitamin C, and fish liver oil to supplement the lack of fat and vitamins A and D. Egg yolk should be added at two or three months to increase protein and iron.</p>
<p>Ordinary milk substitute soy milk recipe: Add eight parts of water to one part by weight of soybeans and soak overnight, grind into a slurry with a stone mill, and squeeze with a sterilized cloth bag. Add 20 cc of starch, 40 cc of sugar, 2 cc of bone powder, and 1 cc of salt to every two market catties of soy milk, and boil for 20 minutes. Stir constantly while cooking to avoid clumping or scorching.</p>
<p>Fried soy milk recipe: Pour sand into the pot and heat it up. After the sand is hot, pour the soybeans into the pot and mix the beans and sand together. Stir evenly with an iron shovel. Fry the soybeans until they crackle and turn light brown (about 15 minutes). Pour the soybean sand into the sieve to sieve out the sand. Wait for the soybeans to cool before grinding. After sieving, put the remaining residue on the mill to grind again. Repeat this process four times until all the soybeans are ground into a very fine powder. Mix soybean flour (50 grams), white sugar (20 grams), starch (10 grams), salt (0.5 grams), bone powder (1 gram), and warm water together, mix well, and then add water to a volume of one pound. Then put the mixture on the fire and boil. After boiling, simmer on low heat for one hour. Stir evenly with a wooden shovel while cooking to avoid burning.</p>
<p>In addition to paying attention to the ingredients of milk substitutes, artificial feeding should pay attention to cleanliness to avoid contaminating bacteria. All foods such as milk, water, sugar, etc., and all utensils such as milk bottles, measuring cups, and spoons must be kept clean. After each use, they should be immersed in clean water to make it easier for waste to flow out, and then put into clean water to boil. Use tongs to put the nipple into a large-mouthed bottle that has been washed with boiling water. Leave the milk bottle in a pot of boiling water or place it on a plate washed with boiling water, covered with a clean cloth. After taking out all the items from the boiling water, do not touch them with fingers or other unsterilized objects. The prepared milk can be put in the refrigerator first, and heated in a pot of warm water when used.</p>
<p>If the amount of breast milk is insufficient, other milk substitutes can be used. Because breast milk has a higher nutritional value, breast milk should be fed first, and the insufficient amount should be supplemented by other milk substitutes.</p>
<p>Too much or too little milk intake than the infant's needs can easily cause illness. If there are no vomiting, diarrhea, or other discomfort symptoms, and the infant's weight increases normally, it indicates that the milk intake is normal. If growth is poor, it is a sign of insufficient milk intake. The amount of milk needed by infants varies with age, weight, and individual. Breastfed infants need two ounces of milk per pound of body weight. For artificially fed infants, it is best to ask a doctor for instructions. The following is a list of the amount of milk and sugar required per pound of body weight per day for reference.</p>
<h3>Marriage Health Certificate</h3>
<p>— Xie Yunshou</p>
<p>The ancients regarded husband and wife as the starting point of human relations. Today, when we talk about the survival and development of the nation, we must naturally start with husband and wife. If the husband and wife who are connected in love have a morbid condition on one side, they will infect each other or pass it on to their descendants, producing unhealthy seeds. Unhealthy seeds are a major factor in the extinction of the nation. For example, as recorded by Pinsbi, the first generation of a family with mental illness was a wild drinker and lecher; the second generation suffered from epilepsy, depression, neurasthenia, and chorea; the third generation suffered from megalomania and depression; the fourth generation suffered from megalomania, nymphomania, intellectual disability, and idiocy; and by the fifth generation, the entire family was extinct. After reading such a record, we naturally shudder. To prevent problems before they occur and to prepare for a rainy day, it is a matter of course that both husband and wife should be healthy in their union.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the health of both sexes, there are of course various conditions that restrict marriage. For example, the reasons for marriage restrictions in the United States are as follows: first, mental illness; second, idiocy; third, dementia, mental retardation, epilepsy, venereal disease, those who are in debt, alcoholism, pulmonary tuberculosis, infectious diseases, and habitual offenders. The methods of adopting the above marriage restriction reasons vary from state to state. Some states adopt one type, and some adopt several types. We will now adopt the most important and easy-to-implement types and try them out first, namely, two major national diseases... venereal disease and tuberculosis.</p>
<p>First, let's discuss venereal disease! A man marries a beautiful woman; a woman marries a successful man; it is truly a happy and congratulatory event for a talented man and a beautiful woman. But unfortunately, after only a few days of happiness in the honeymoon, due to the relationship of being infected with venereal disease, gonorrhea, syphilis, and soft chancre occur, making the beautiful bride listless; the bridegroom! There are also unspeakable sufferings, making a small family full of joy turn into a hell shrouded in sorrow. Such a painful situation is difficult for people who have not experienced it to understand. I will now briefly explain the harm of venereal disease.</p>
<p>After contracting gonorrhea, in addition to local pain such as painful urination and purulent discharge, the most important thing for men is the occurrence of gonococcal orchitis, which causes infertility. For women, in addition to gonococcal urethritis, it can also rise to the uterus and fallopian tubes, causing infertility. More than half of female infertility can be attributed to gonorrhea. As for the excessive menstruation, leucorrhea, and abdominal pain during menstruation during uterine gonorrhea, it is also a lifetime of suffering.</p>
<p>Syphilis! In addition to the various pains such as hard chancre, syphilitic rash, muscle and bone pain, and visceral syphilis, the most important thing for both men and women is that it is transmitted to their descendants, causing congenital syphilis. Abortion and premature birth are the most important phenomena of syphilis. Medically, when encountering a woman who often has abortions, most of them are suspected of having syphilis. There is also a connection between syphilis and mental illness. According to statistics, one-third of mental illnesses are caused by syphilis.</p>
<p>In addition to syphilis and gonorrhea, venereal diseases also include soft chancre and inguinal lymphogranuloma venereum. Although they are not as important as gonorrhea and syphilis, they can also cause serious pain to your body after contracting them. According to what I have said above, we know that the harm of venereal disease is not a personal matter. It can be transmitted to the other party, and it can also affect the descendants, causing them to become extinct. From the perspective of national survival and development, it is truly an important factor in natural selection. In addition, if mental illness occurs due to syphilis, it is an uneasy factor for the family, the society, and the country. In addition, the loss of time and money caused by venereal disease is truly a major loss to the country!</p>
<p>The second is tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease, especially easier to transmit between husband and wife. After husband and wife are infected, they can also pass the tuberculosis constitution on to their descendants. That is, the children born to tuberculous couples are prone to tuberculosis. In addition, the national knowledge of seed residence is naive, and most people do not know to pay attention to the transmission of tuberculosis bacteria. Unknowingly, children also develop tuberculosis, so most of them die young before reaching middle age. People who talk about Feng Shui will wag their tongues, saying that the Feng Shui of a certain family's tomb is not good, and that generations are single men. The direction of a certain family's house is unlucky, and they do not leave descendants. In fact, what is the relationship between the tomb base and the house? Isn't it the mischief of tuberculosis bacteria!</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want to create a healthy family and protect the prosperity of the nation, before both sexes marry, everyone must present a health certificate to prove the health of both parties. This certificate may be more important than education, status, wealth, beauty, etc.!</p>
<p>Every pound of the baby needs two ounces of liquid, remove the total amount of milk, then you can get the amount of water, the baby's food intake and needs often vary from person to person, so the above amount should be slightly increased or decreased depending on the situation.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to feed the baby within twelve hours after delivery, give a little water every two hours (5% glucose or sucrose solution can be used). After the milk is secreted, breastfeed once every three or four hours depending on the strength of the baby. 2:00 a.m., 6:00 a.m., 10:00 a.m., 2:00 p.m., 6:00 p.m., and 10:00 p.m. are the most suitable times. By two months, the 2:00 a.m. feeding can be reduced by one time, and after nine months, the 10:00 p.m. feeding can also be stopped. Weak babies suck very little each time and can be breastfed every three hours before the third or fourth month. Give warm boiled water between two feedings, 8:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., 4:00 p.m., and 8:00 p.m. are appropriate. The first week after birth, 1 ounce of water can be fed each time, 1.5 ounces of water can be fed each time in the second week, and then half an ounce can be added each month, and 4 ounces can be fed each time after eight months. Drinking water can be replaced by fruit juice or vegetable juice. The breastfeeding time should not be too long, preferably about 20 minutes. If the time is too long, the baby may inhale air, causing stomach distension and reduced appetite. If the baby's sucking power is insufficient, the milk can be squeezed out with a bottle after sucking for a few minutes. Babies should avoid sleeping while breastfeeding. Artificial feeding should not be too fast, and the size of the nipple should be appropriate (one drop should flow every three inches when the bottle is inverted). The mother and baby should not be disturbed during breastfeeding. After each breastfeeding, the baby should be held upright. Let the baby's head rest on the adult's shoulder, and pat the back to allow air to escape from the mouth.</p>
<p>The nutrients in breast milk or cow's milk are lacking, so both natural breastfeeding and artificial feeding need foods rich in minerals and vitamins to supplement them. At the same time, adding supplementary nutrients can reduce the difficulty of weaning later, so it is used as a preparation for weaning. The supplementary foods are described below:</p>
<p>(A) Fruit juice or vegetable juice: Artificially fed infants should start adding foods rich in vitamin C such as orange juice within one month, and breastfed infants should start adding them after three months. Feed twice a day, one or two spoons each time, gradually increasing to one or two ounces. If orange juice is not suitable, grapefruit or tomato, radish, lotus root, cabbage, or various green vegetable juices can be used instead. Sugar can be added when it is too sour. The amount of vitamin C in vegetables is less than that in oranges, so the amount must be increased compared to orange juice. The amount of tomato juice should be doubled compared to orange juice, and the amount of cabbage juice should be tripled.</p>
<p>Vitamin C is easily damaged by high heat, so the sterilization time of each item should not be too long. The temperature should not be too high. At the same time, it is best to make and eat it immediately to avoid the loss of vitamin C.</p>
<p>a Fresh orange juice recipe: The fruit and juicer must be disinfected. Cut into large pieces, place in the juicer, and rotate several times. The fruit juice flows into the filter, and add an equal amount of cooled boiled water.</p>
<p>b Tomato juice recipe: Wash the tomatoes and put them in a steamer for ten minutes, then put them in a sterilized gauze bag and squeeze them out. Add an equal amount of warm boiled water.</p>
<p>c Radish juice recipe: After washing the radish, immerse it in boiling water with the utensils for disinfection. Use a grater to rub the radish into shreds, and place it in a gauze bag to squeeze out the juice. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Afterword to "Drafts of Futh-tang Poetry and Prose"</h3>
<p>— Chen Youqin</p>
<p>I chanced upon an old edition of "Futh-tang Poetry," in three volumes, and "Prose," in one volume, by Tan Xian (Zhongxiu), the most famous Hangzhou literati of the Qing Dynasty, at an old book stall in Hangzhou. I spent the equivalent of a pack of cigarettes, or one thousand yuan, and this fine book was in my possession.</p>
<p>Although it is not a fragment from the "Futh-tang Collected Works," it is a reprinting of the Fuzhou edition based on the Beijing edition of the ninth year of Xianfeng (1859). The inscription at the beginning of the book reads "Sanshan Ki Shi Wu Yutian," showing how seriously the engraver took his work.</p>
<p>Having never read the "Futh-tang Collected Works," acquiring this book is a small consolation and better than nothing.</p>
<p>My knowledge of Tan Futh-tang comes from reading "A Selection of Qing Dynasty Poetry with Commentary," compiled by Xu Ke Zhongke of Hangxian, published in 1926. Almost all the commentary in that book is attributed to "Master Tan Futh-tang said." I thought, since it's Tan Futh-tang's commentary, why didn't the editor rename the book "Tan Futh-tang's Commentary on a Selection of Qing Dynasty Poetry?" (Only a very few poems in the entire book use Kuang Kui-sheng's commentary).</p>
<p>Later, I read Wu Mei's "General Treatise on Poetry," which discusses Tan Tingxian (Tan Xian was also known as Tingxian). He says: "Zhongxiu's poetry takes a very high path, its origins and branches reaching deeply. Peering into his mind and vision, he not only disdains Chen (Qinian) and Zhu (Zhuzhai), but also traces back to the Tang and Five Dynasties. This is a transformation of Zhejiang poetry. Zhongxiu himself said: 'The poetry of Nanjing is exhausted, trivial and cluttered. Those who study Zhu and Li become impoverished beggars. Mei'an is lofty and bright, Pinjia is clear and sparse, transforming Zhejiang poetry.' I say that Wu and Guo are not worthy of this statement; it is Futh-tang who transformed Zhejiang poetry..." Wu Mei Guang-sheng valued and esteemed Futh-tang so highly.</p>
<p>His friend Zhuang Yu (Zhongbai) of Dantu, in his preface to Futh-tang's poetry, said: "...Among recent authors, Zhuzhai extracts the essence and discards the dross of the Song, Mingke traces the origins but does not exhaust the ramifications. In terms of the interest within the meaning and beyond the words, Zhongxiu's work is almost without flaw..." This is not flattery, but a true assessment shared by the ancients.</p>
<p>As for Futh-tang's poetry, his friend Wu Huaizhen said it most earnestly:</p>
<p>"...Now, when you write poetry, what stirs your heart and moves your emotions, I truly do not know what you feel and why, and even I cannot fully grasp the meaning. Yet it is gentle and penetrating, moving and touching, making people sing, shout, grieve, and rejoice uncontrollably. It is essentially the same as the ancient writers, springing from the correctness of feelings. Alas! What is deeply felt is painful, what is difficult to say is profound. How painful and profound are his words!..."</p>
<p>Opening and reading Futh-tang's poetry, one feels that although his output is not large, it truly deserves Wu Huaizhen's praise. His initial collection contains eighty-six poems, the "Northern Expedition Poems" one hundred and four, and the "Min Travel Poems" ninety, only two hundred and eighty in total. But each poem is exquisite, likely because the author himself edited and revised them, combining the strengths of the authors of the Han, Wei, Six Dynasties, and early Tang, and forming his own style. He disdained those of the middle and late Tang and later periods. The more one reads, the more lovable they become. In the "Selection of Qing Dynasty Quatrains" (Kaiming edition) that I compiled in the past, I only selected three quatrains he wrote in Gaoyou (see page 97), a mere taste, not glimpsing the full picture. Now, seeing his collection, almost all of his ancient and modern poems are excellent. The ancient style poems are too long, making it inconvenient to cite many examples. His regulated verses, such as: "Presented to Master Wang Yifeng of Yizheng":</p>
<p>Climbing the tower, I write an elegy, doubly sorrowful,</p>
<p>Wang Can, year after year, at a crossroads;</p>
<p>The smoke and haze of the lost land grieve my flesh and blood,</p>
<p>The famous scholars who crossed the river are close to being adrift.</p>
<p>In the years of war, people are colorless,</p>
<p>In writing, the mountains and rivers are finely intertwined.</p>
<p>The west wind blows, leaves falling, the river is wide,</p>
<p>Thinking of home, I lie ill, when the wild geese arrive.</p>
<p>Sending Master Shou Qiao Back to Zhuji:</p>
<p>How is the night in the wind and rain? The migrating geese have all crossed</p>
<p>the River.</p>
<p>The master is still on the road, the country is in the midst of warfare.</p>
<p>In his twilight years, his heroic heart remains, with a deep cup of turbid wine,</p>
<p>There is no need to face the Yi River; farewells are full of sorrowful songs.</p>
<p>Reading them today, they are still enough to stir one's heart.</p>
<p>His short poems in the plain style, such as "A Little Cart":</p>
<p>The little cart creaks along the yellow sand,</p>
<p>An old father in front, a young child behind,</p>
<p>Inviting passersby by the roadside, but they only shake their heads.</p>
<p>For three days, no wheat porridge has entered my mouth,</p>
<p>My home, Yangzhou, was a place of peaceful rest;</p>
<p>When the bandits came like the wind, the eldest son was hanged;</p>
<p>The white sun is dim, the Huai River is vast;</p>
<p>The flying mosquitoes pierce the sky, people are cheap as grass.</p>
<p>The drums and horns of the barracks sound all day long,</p>
<p>Strong men and fat horses fill the roads,</p>
<p>The little cart creaks, hauling horse fodder." The atmosphere is like "An Orphan's Song." I never imagined that the situation in northern Jiangsu today is still the same as the author's time.</p>
<p>Futh-tang's prose consists of twenty-nine pieces in Volume A and twenty-nine pieces in Volume B. I have read these fifty-eight poems almost a thousand times. The six chapters of "Butterfly Loves Flowers," appreciated by Wu Quan'an, are indeed echoes of Wen and Wei, and cannot be imitated by those who only study the Southern Song. Even his "Bodhisattva Man" poems are not inferior to those of Tingyun.</p>
<p>The "General Treatise on Poetry" quotes his work "Golden Pavilion Song, Tangqi Moonlit Night" (see page 182 of the original book). I particularly love his "Full Courtyard Fragrance":</p>
<p>"The flowers are about to depart, the song is like a pet, my mood is not like it used to be,</p>
<p>Peach mats dreaming, green wine talking about the old days.</p>
<p>The ground is full of ivy, like water, no one comes to the Doucao fence.</p>
<p>The wind begins to rise, pond duckweed a speck at a time, shaking, it cannot make a circle.</p>
<p>Outside the Yangliu trees, freshly tuned pipes, half new strings.</p>
<p>Try to ask again who told the old stories of Qilu Palace, bearing the late wind and dew,</p>
<p>the trees of the parting pavilion are lightly stained with smoke. The sound slowly dies, the high tower, the micro-moon, green sleeves divide the heavy .</p>
<p>In the book, there is a postscript written in the personal calligraphy of Huang Chongxing Zici:</p>
<p>"Futh-tang Poetry and Prose, a total of four volumes, written by Tan Tingxian Zhongxiu of Hangzhou. Since Chongxing knew poetry, this is the only contemporary poet he has seen. Zhongxiu is now the magistrate of my county, but I have not yet met him. I obtained his engraved poems in Gaocha , brought them home, and every time I unfold and enjoy them, my heart and eyes feel refreshed. Written in the winter of the fourth year of Guangxu (1878) by Huang Chongxing at his residence in Fuzhou."</p>
<p>The calligraphy is excellent, and the seals and ten inkpads are all top-notch. I do not know what kind of person Mr. Huang is, but from the postscript, I know that he was a contemporary of Tan Xian, and that Tan Xian not only served as the magistrate of HanShan County, but also once served as the magistrate of She County. This volume was obtained by Mr. Huang in Fuzhou. I do not know how it flowed into the hands of a Hangzhou person. Today, I was able to obtain it in exchange for a mere box of cigarettes, treating it as a priceless treasure. Fortunately, I did not allow the hawkers to tear it apart and use it to wrap peanuts. It cannot be said that this book's encounter was not fortunate.</p>
<h3>Concerning Wallace</h3>
<p>— Zhongqi</p>
<p>Edgar Wallace (1875-1932), a popular British novelist, was a prolific writer. Around 1928, Britain truly experienced "Wallace mania." At the time, publishers estimated that on average, one out of every four books sold was written by Wallace. Later, someone proposed in The Times to build a "Wallace Museum" in London, where one could see the great writer who wrote novels with his right hand, plays with his left hand, essays with his left foot, and theater reviews with his right foot - Wallace.</p>
<h3>Lady Bardwinati</h3>
<p>— Badewi Naiti</p>
<p>Profile portraits were popular in ancient times. Giotto and Bardwinati (1425-1499)'s portrait of Lady Bardwinati are world-famous treasures.</p>
<p>Bardwinati produced very few works in his life, and those he did create were exquisite and meticulous, regardless of time or effort. It is said that this portrait took a full four years to complete, and every strand of golden hair and every pearl was painted with meticulous detail. The patterns on the clothing were especially carefully crafted. The entire surface of the painting is like a relief on a gold pound, protruding from the canvas and able to be touched by hand. The work is currently housed in the National Gallery in London. (Liu Shi)</p>
<h3>Introduction to the Journal of Nantong College</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yuanyang</p>
<p>Nantong College has been established for more than forty years. Alumni are all over the country. The long history of the school and the large number of graduates rank it among the top institutions of higher education in the country. In the past, the virtuous sage Mr. Zhang Jian, for the sake of national modernization and industrialization, founded specialized schools of spinning, weaving, medicine, and other disciplines in Nantong, aiming to cultivate specialized talents in various practical fields in a corner of the country, laying the talent foundation for the national industry. At the same time, he successively established various reclamation and animal husbandry companies and textile companies in the coastal counties, aiming to establish scale and lay the business foundation for the national agriculture and industry. His far-sightedness, thorough planning, grand ambition, and resolute action, even viewed today, forty years later, are still brand new and forward-looking. His person and his deeds are even more worthy of emulation for all time and admiration by the world. Nantong College inherently possesses the founder's creative spirit and excellent traditions, and looking to the future, it has an even greater mission to undertake. Therefore, although the school is privately run, the support from all parties is indispensable. Although the location of the school is in a remote corner, the talents recruited come from all over the country. Although the disciplines of the school are limited to specialized technical training in agriculture, textile, medicine, and pharmacy, the cadres trained are often able to supply the needs of national construction projects. In this way, progressing step by step, adapting to change, burying oneself in learning and transmission, and not seeking fame and fortune, has been the case for forty years. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War ten years ago, Nantong fell into the hands of the enemy. Nantong College was forced to move to the sea. In the middle of the process, it experienced hardships and struggles, but it was still able to maintain its independent and unyielding vitality, and the sound of singing has never stopped. This is still due to the school's inherent great history and excellent traditions. In April after the victory, Yuanyang, following the instructions of the school board, came to take charge of school affairs. At the beginning of his tenure, he followed the intention of the school board and announced the following guidelines: (1) Restore the school in Nantong, (2) Restore the honest and simple learning style, (3) Inherit the tradition of enterprise. I will briefly explain each of these separately:</p>
<p>First: Why must the school be restored in Nantong? In terms of the suitable environment for running higher education, every major trading and economic center is prosperous and noisy, which is not conducive to running a school. Although there are a few teaching conveniences, it is particularly unfavorable to the basic tasks of cultivating the young minds and educating the character of young people. Nantong has a quiet environment, suitable for studying. The model of the sages is still there, and it is enough to provide the young people with lingering admiration everywhere. Although there is a river separating it from Shanghai, transportation is slightly inconvenient, but the school buildings are spacious, and the scale of farms, yarn factories, and hospitals are all complete, which is convenient for research and practical training. Therefore, restoring the school in Nantong is the first priority to continue the school's glorious life. Last fall, five classes of new students were enrolled and are all taking classes in Nantong. After the summer this year, it is still planned to continue enrolling new students in Nantong. If the area is safe and the bandits are silent, it is expected that the entire school will return to its old buildings in a short period of time to lay the permanent foundation of the college.</p>
<p>Second: Why must the honest and simple learning style be restored? The learning style of Nantong College has always been honest and simple. Students immersed themselves in research, diligent and hard-working, only seeking to acquire knowledge to serve the world. The teachers also adhered to the ancient training of respecting the teacher and valuing the way, tirelessly transmitting and imparting knowledge, and were only engaged in imparting knowledge and teaching skills. This is entirely based on the original intention of the founder. When the founder, Zhang Jian, was alive, he repeatedly instructed the students to pay attention to guiding students into the realms of peace of mind, endurance of hardship, reading more, and discussing less. Therefore, all the people who graduated from Nantong College, whether scattered in the educational circles, all adhered to this principle, adhered to the truth and embraced simplicity, and worked hard in their positions, which has become a trend. Since the school moved to Shanghai, students were infected with the prevailing frivolous habits of the time. At the same time, due to complex environmental perceptions, their bodies could not be at ease and their hearts could not be at peace. They also had no self-run factories or farms to use for practical training. Occasionally, they followed teachers to visit and browse, seeing the flowers while riding a horse, which was not enough to talk about enduring hardship and practicing labor. At the same time, the school lacked books and the social atmosphere of reading was not strong, so most courses were taught through lectures and general discussions, and activities were used to replace practical training. Commentators said that the restoration of Nantong College is easy, but the restoration of the learning style is difficult. It cannot be said that this is without reason. Last autumn, the school board decided to first establish the new student class in Nantong. The main purpose was to gradually restore the excellent learning style and reading atmosphere of the past, starting from the new student class. The intention was very profound.</p>
<p>Third: Why must the tradition of enterprise be inherited? The reason is very clear, and there is no need to elaborate. The enterprises founded by Zhang Jian of Nantong form a system in itself. There is a famous saying: "Father education, mother industry." Education and industry must be coordinated, just like the phenomenon in the universe that solitary Yin does not generate and solitary Yang does not grow, and rain falls only after Yin and Yang are in harmony. Education is a means, while the development of industry and the use of resources for the benefit of the people is the goal. If education does not cultivate talents for industry, or the talents cultivated are still not applicable to the needs of various departments of industry, then this educational facility is no different from waste. Therefore, education and industry should complement each other and cooperate with each other, so that construction can have a basis and the country can be built.</p>
<p>The future of Nantong College depends on whether these three missions can be gradually completed. To complete these missions, it depends on the common understanding and concentrated efforts of all teachers and students of the school. This journal was born in order to achieve this task. In other words, the task of this journal is to figure out how to mobilize all the teachers and students of the school to quickly prepare to return to Nantong and no longer linger in the prosperous sea? How to encourage all the teachers and students of the school to advocate practicality and eliminate extravagance, and restore the industrious and simple learning style of the past? How to encourage all the teachers and students of the school to accept the tradition, inherit the cause of the sages, and promote and develop it? As for its own editing style, classification columns, and writing skills, these are things for the editors to worry about and will not be discussed in detail. Only whether it can meet the objective expectations is not certain. It is hoped that colleagues in the school and distant colleagues will often offer pearls and jade, and do not hesitate to give instructions, so that this journal can continue to grow and prosper and achieve its ideal mission. Then it will not only be a blessing for Yuanyang alone.</p>
<h3>Green Apple</h3>
<p>— Ke Ren</p>
<p>Rain threads dance in the air.</p>
<p>A kind of passionate and uneasy emotion shocks me, making it difficult for me to find a moment of peace. I always feel like something is hanging in my heart, heavy and painful. In fact, everything is already in place, and I'm just waiting to leave. Could there be anything I can't bear to part with on this grassland? Except for her—that beautiful and melancholic child; but I've already said goodbye to her... Finally, I put on my raincoat, grabbed an umbrella, and walked to the muddy road.</p>
<p>Her school is quite a distance away, requiring walking the entire length of this road, and then walking a section of sandy road outside the city. On rainy days, that section of road is filled with puddles of various sizes and depths. But these problems don't bother me at all. I only feel relaxed and happy at this moment; just like the emotions of someone who has been entangled in bitter thoughts, after making a painful decision one morning.</p>
<p>I met her in the reception room of her school:</p>
<p>"Let's go out!" I stared at her; although my tone was a little rushed, I tried my best to maintain a musical quality.</p>
<p>"No! There's still class"; she seemed a little reserved and cold.</p>
<p>Experience and intelligence help me to perceive the heart of a young girl decorated with green leaves and thorny fruits; therefore, I approached her, wearing an enthusiastic and sincere expression:</p>
<p>"Meiben, let's go, I'll ask for leave for you, definitely!"</p>
<p>She hesitated for a long time, and finally said softly:</p>
<p>"Okay, then you go ahead."</p>
<p>I guessed that she was afraid of being laughed at by her classmates.</p>
<p>Outside the school gate, I handed her the umbrella. She didn't say anything. We hadn't walked far when I called two rickshaws. The rain was still dancing softly. I leaned over to peek, wanting to steal a look at her face through the gap in the raincloth under the rickshaw; did she like it after all? Or was she annoyed? But my eyes were always limited to her chest, to a small golden flower woven on her red sweater.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later, we were already sitting in the restaurant of Lele Restaurant.</p>
<p>I said triumphantly and tenderly:</p>
<p>"Today is our first time going out alone, right? A memorable time."</p>
<p>She smiled, a leisurely smile, and the reserved and cold color just now faded away completely.</p>
<p>When a young man first dates a girlfriend, it's often hard to know where to start the conversation. After getting used to it, he naturally talks and laughs freely. At this time, I was like preparing for a careful old exam, always using appropriate techniques to adjust our conversation.</p>
<p>She suddenly asked me if I had a girlfriend in S city. I told her solemnly:</p>
<p>"Girlfriend and lover are two completely different things. You might as well make more boyfriends, but among those friends, you should choose the most understanding one."</p>
<p>She lowered her head slightly. Was what she was thinking about in the same world as what I was thinking about?</p>
<p>The rain stopped. I invited her to dance and take a walk before going back. She agreed happily.</p>
<p>I walked close to her, but always kept a little distance. The sky was getting close to dusk, and it was right after the rain, so the road was very quiet. Should I hold her arm to walk? Wouldn't that be very natural and ordinary? But, she is Zhang Yuan; therefore, I didn't do what I thought about after all.</p>
<p>On the way, I accompanied her to visit one of her classmates, who was also leaving this place in the next two days. She earnestly instructed her to write more letters after she left; I suddenly remembered that she had repeatedly told me to send fewer letters after I left. Why is that? Is it because I am a man that her family would blame her?</p>
<p>After walking out of her classmate's house, she stood close to me at the door when she waved goodbye; a flower bloomed in my heart.</p>
<p>It was already dark when I sent her home. I planned to create a farewell kiss when we parted, or at least print the kiss on her palm. But things often happen unexpectedly; when we reached a few steps from her door, she only said "Here," and hurried up, waving to me while shouting at the door. I couldn't see the expression on her face in the dim light.</p>
<p>A mysterious place, a mysterious child...</p>
<p>The next day, I set off for the eastern coast; at the station, she sent a bag of green apples produced from the grassland, with a piece of paper sandwiched inside, which read:</p>
<p>"Bless you, make more close friends outside."</p>
<p>I was at a loss. I picked up a cute little green apple at random, and used it to throw it out the window, wishing my feelings to stay with it on the grassland.</p>
<h3>Poetry</h3>
<p>— Yu Heng</p>
<p>Songs are more intuitive compared to poems, because they combine with musical scores to form music. Musical scores are generated from emotions and give rise to imagination; lyrics are generated from imagination and develop emotions.</p>
<p>Poems combine the artistic and literary values of painting, music, novels, essays...</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, a River of Blood 515</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Hello..." He Jian grabbed the phone receiver, "Who? Ah, yes, Mr. Shouyi? Please ask him to come up quickly..." It turned out to be the hotel phone, reporting that Shouyi had arrived.</p>
<p>"It's very strange, how did the hotel not notice when this young lady came just now?" He Jian asked himself. He didn't expect that this young lady, being so incredibly resourceful, still didn't have a way to mix into the hotel?</p>
<p>"Did you meet your sister?" He Jian greeted Shouyi at the elevator door, and asked this question as soon as they met.</p>
<p>"Who?" Shouyi was a little stunned.</p>
<p>"That young lady who went downstairs just now, dragging two small braids, quite beautiful?" He Jian invited Shouyi into the room, telling Shouyi.</p>
<p>"Oh, a round face," Shouyi sat down, half guessing, "a smile with two dimples, a Beijing accent, a very sweet voice, a pair of big eyes, rolling around..."</p>
<p>"That's right, isn't she your sister?" He Jian officially became suspicious.</p>
<p>"Hey, her?" Shouyi chuckled.</p>
<p>"Isn't it her?... Sixteen or seventeen years old?..." He Jian made up for the age, fearing that Shouyi had guessed the wrong person, "Her?..."</p>
<p>"She is one of the four great mischievous people of our Baisizhuang, Yan, the Yan of color - named Zishan. She is the youngest, but also the most mischievous... and also a troublemaker!... But how did she get here?... What did she come to do?..." Shouyi asked He Jian.</p>
<p>"Hey,... it's a long story..., this is really a long story." He Jian was a little bit amused and speechless when he thought of what Zishan had just done.</p>
<p>"You suffered a loss?" Shouyi saw He Jian's awkward face.</p>
<p>"The people of your Baisizhuang are really amazing!" He Jian then briefly told Shouyi what had just happened.</p>
<p>Shouyi smiled, and suddenly frowned, "Not good... she asked about Pingzi's appearance?" Shouyi fixed his eyes and asked He Jian, and then muttered to himself; "These roles are causing trouble again... the good plan is afraid that they will mess it up..."</p>
<p>"What?" He Jian was surprised and suspicious.</p>
<p>"We have to go quickly...!" Shouyi looked at his watch.</p>
<p>"What exactly is going on?" He Jian didn't understand the main idea of Shouyi's words.</p>
<p>"Originally, I had an appointment with Li Ming, to meet with the manpower from the Korean side, at 10:30 at the entrance of the Bund Park, to attack Hongzhen.... Why did we have to go at 10:30? Because I was at the Juechang Old Man and Xiaozhuang and my brother's plan, before 10:30, I sent two teams of people from my village to clear the remaining two windows for them and take out the 'hostage.' But now..." Shouyi pondered, and was looking at his watch again.</p>

<h3>Random Musings from Solitude</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>It is difficult to depict pain when in pain.</p>
<p>Only when the pain has been determined, in other words, when the pain has had a considerable distance from oneself, can it be depicted. Ancient Chinese poets seemed to understand this very clearly, it is called "thinking of the pain after the pain has been determined."</p>
<p>All experiences are the same as pain. It is difficult to have appropriate insights during the experience.</p>
<p>Getting too close to another face will make it unclear (naturally, being too far is the same). A considerable spatial distance must be maintained.</p>
<p>Poets, philosophers... all people with particularly keen senses can maintain a considerable distance between their body and soul. In distance, one can seek truth, goodness, and beauty.</p>
<p>Distance is not alienation. Schopenhauer has a good metaphor: On a cold winter day, many porcupines huddled together, trying to get warmth. But when they were pricked by the arrows brought by each other, they had to disperse. The cold made them gather again, and they scattered again when they gathered too tightly. Finally, they learned from experience that maintaining an appropriate distance was the most suitable. Not only can they get some slight warmth, but they won't hurt each other.</p>
<p>This is a valuable fable, worth hearing by "the laughing animal" (it is said that only humans can laugh).</p>
<p>I have a chronic habit of writing articles under lamplight late at night. I am ashamed that my thoughts are like fireflies. In the sunlight, I can't even see myself.</p>
<p>Some people laugh at me as a night owl. I can only use a famous British saying to comfort myself:</p>
<p>"Darkness is more productive of sublime ideas than light."</p>
<h3>"Anchor" Returns from Tokyo</h3>
<p>— Baoqing</p>
<p>A few days ago, the first merchant ship, Xing'an, seized during the war and returned, sailed back to the embrace of the motherland from Japan. On board were two iron anchors and chains, and eight cannonballs. These shameful antiques were displayed by the Japanese at the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo as war trophies commemorating the Sino-Japanese War.</p>
<p>The anchors have finally returned from Tokyo! But recalling the history of these two anchors, and the negotiations for their return, their experiences are also the experiences of the nation! During the Sino-Japanese War, the Beiyang Fleet of our country was completely destroyed after the battles of Fengdao, the Yellow Sea, and the defense of Weihaiwei. The battleships Dingyuan, cruisers Laiyuan, Jingyuan, Zhiyuan, Chengyuan, gunboats Weiji, Meiyun, and torpedo boats were sunk. The warships Yongwei and Yangwei were burned by shells, and the Guangjia capsized after hitting a reef. The Zhenyuan-class gunboats Zhenyuan, Pingyuan, and Kangji, etc., were forced to surrender at Liugong Island and other places due to lack of ammunition and reinforcements. Although our fleet had some with large displacements, such as the Zhenyuan, with a displacement of 7,430 tons, which was much larger than the largest Japanese warship with a displacement of 4,278 tons, they all had poor armor, artillery, and speed, and the army failed to cooperate and exert combat power. However, the spirit of heroic battle has been greatly written in history. The iron anchors were taken from the captured ships such as the Zhenyuan.</p>
<p>News of the negotiations for the return of the iron anchors first came in mid-March last year from a Central News Agency dispatch, saying that the Japanese were willing to return the iron anchors of the Zhenyuan ship captured in the Sino-Japanese War to China. Later, our government requested MacArthur's headquarters to order the return of the aforementioned items. In July, MacArthur's headquarters rejected China's request to return the iron anchors, saying that Japan had no right to dispose of property acquired before 1937. However, the authority of the Allied headquarters to detain Japanese war criminals since the "September 18th" Incident surely extended beyond 1937? At this time, our new fleet was returning from the United States via Japan.</p>
<p>Now the anchors and cannonballs have been returned. During this year, how many negotiations did the delegation to Japan go through? However, the number of shameful antiques of our country existing in Japanese shrines and other public places is far more than these. The Qing Dynasty's dragon flags, military uniforms, general's cannons, etc., from the Sino-Japanese War must still be on display in many places. This requires our compatriots to pay attention at all times and expose them at all times. It is also the unshirkable responsibility of our delegation to investigate and negotiate for their return in a timely manner.</p>
<h3>Welcoming Gods and Temple Fairs</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Recently, according to people from my hometown, welcoming gods and temple fairs are very popular everywhere. Not only are puppets, mud gods, ox-headed horse-faced figures very active, but also many local tyrants and hooligans take this opportunity to gamble, perform plays, and stay up all night, causing great disorder in the local area. There are also those who are ruined by gambling.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the question of how superstitious welcoming gods and temple fairs are, they are always a kind of rural behavior that whitewashes a prosperous age. Originally, in a peaceful and prosperous rural society, everyone worked hard for a year, and it was not too much to use welcoming gods and temple fairs to relax and entertain themselves. But what day is it today? Rural areas are bankrupt, and the lives of farmers are unbearably miserable. How can we bear to see such expensive temple fairs waste the little money farmers have?</p>
<p>Therefore, some idle people in the countryside initiate welcoming gods and temple fairs to embellish peace, but in reality, they contain countless blood, sweat, and tears of the farmers.</p>
<h3>Cars and Types</h3>
<p>— Fengli</p>
<p>After the victory, various cars appeared on the streets of Shanghai. I have ridden in these cars, but I can't name them. Driven by curiosity, I conducted a survey and provided it for readers' reference: Bus Traffic car Cheese Box Staff car Commander Command car Crane Crane Jeep Jeep motor cycle Motorcycle personnary carrier Infantry car pick up Transport car sedan Sedan staion wagon Station wagon truck Truck weapons carrier Ordnance carrier</p>
<h3>"Youth China"</h3>
<p>— Wubian</p>
<p>The national liberation war led the youth of China to the front line of the war against Japan. They participated in troop service, went deep into the countryside, organized the masses, mobilized the masses, eliminated the gap between the military and the people, and made the army and the people one, completing the highest requirement of military-civilian cooperation. This is the contribution of those Chinese youths who served in the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>However, the political work team in the play did not know so much from birth. They only learned constantly in their work, which enabled them to overcome the difficulties in their work. At the same time, more importantly, the playwright Yang Hansheng correctly pointed out that propaganda cannot only rely on selling "dog skin plasters" to be effective, but must relieve their pain and truly serve them, so that the military and the people can become one family.</p>
<p>Following "Eight Thousand Miles of Cloud and Moon", this is another film depicting intellectual youth serving on the battlefield. In fact, this "Youth China" was produced in the Great Rear Area, and it was produced very early, so now it seems that some places always have a considerable distance.</p>
<p>However, due to the simplicity of the script, the director has achieved considerable success in the performance.</p>
<p>What is even more rare is that this film almost included all the famous actors in the Great Rear Area, Tao Jin, Wei Heling, Xiang Kun, Wu Yin, Sun Jianbai, Zhang Manping, Yang Wei, etc. participated, and Bai Yang's political work team, Lin Fei's mother Li, and Qian Qianli's teacher Lu are the most outstanding in acting.</p>
<p>This is a film worth recommending.</p>
<h3>Woman · Woman — Additional Remarks on "Song of a Wanderer"</h3>
<p>— Luobin</p>
<p>After watching "Song of a Wanderer," I had many feelings and couldn't help but make these additional remarks.</p>
<p>Woman, the definition of this proper noun, seems that no one has ever given a correct annotation. Especially in our country, she is like a beast of burden, a vase, a reproductive machine, a tool for venting desire... all kinds of things that men can buy wholesale and retail. She is "dung" that can be trampled on at will, a "bane" that can ruin the country and harm the body, a "rare commodity" that can be exchanged for wealth and honor. In short, she is everything all-encompassing.</p>
<p>Since the ancient sages advocated classics, rituals, and laws, as half of the living beings that make up our society, they have been "equally" "treated favorably" and "abused". Freedom of knowledge, freedom of work, and even freedom of survival, are all handled by men. From soul to body, they are enslaved by the power of men. Whoever is the least free, the most obedient, and the most able to obtain the title of "virtuous" will be respected.</p>
<p>Although there have been some famous women in history, such as the ancient Greek beauty Helen and our Chen Yuanyuan, who have caused long-term wars of suffering for the people, their every move could overturn a country, but in all fairness, they were still victims of men's possessiveness, and men pushed them to that position.</p>
<p>For thousands of years, there have been too many physical, mental, and ideological constraints pressing on women's heads and instilled in their minds. In other words, the power of men in opposition to them is still too strong. To give an example: in Shanghai last year, the number of abandoned babies, of which women accounted for an absolute majority. This is the largest city in the East, and the gender concepts of ordinary people are still like this. If we extend it to remote inland areas with backward education, youth culture, and economy, undoubtedly, this phenomenon must be even more serious.</p>
<p>Here, I want to solemnly declare that I am not a pessimist of fate. Pointing out this phenomenon is only to prove that the road for women to fight for freedom and liberation is full of difficulties. In addition to those objectively existing obstacles, there are still many problems in themselves. For example, Ruoying in "Song of a Wanderer" is a typical representative. Her thoughts and soul are completely succumbed to male power and compromise with her own weakness, and there are indeed many such women. Of course, we cannot blame all this on women, because the creation of this situation is the result of thousands of years of male dominance.</p>
<p>However, if women want to gain true liberation, they must first revolutionize themselves, abandon those habits of living in ease and dependence, and not be satisfied with freedom in name only. First, there must be an independent personality, and then we can talk about other things.</p>
<p>To say it again, this is not a unilateral responsibility of women. If this unreasonable phenomenon continues, it is also a shame for men, because they are unwilling to give up their privileges.</p>

<h3>Mozart's Ears (Anecdote)</h3>
<p>— Kedi</p>
<p>"Music prodigy" Mozart (Mozart 1756-1791), the reason why he became a world-renowned composer is not only that his talent is still regarded as a miracle by the world, but also that he has a pair of ears different from others.</p>
<p>When she was four or five years old, she could hear the subtle differences in the pitch of sounds. Once, after listening to a guest play the violin, she said to the guest:</p>
<p>"The sound of your violin is about a quarter of a tone different from the sound of my violin."</p>
<p>Mozart often liked to go to church to listen to long musical performances. After listening to them, he often recorded them based on the impressions left in his mind, and the results were accurate to the millimeter. Such ears are truly rare in the world! According to European scholars' research on the structure of his ears, they are indeed different from ordinary people. This is a unique talent.</p>
<p>However, although Mozart had this pair of ears that deeply understood music, he was most afraid of hearing people play the "trombone" when he was young. He often said:</p>
<p>"This sound is about to shatter my ears!"</p>
<p>From this situation, it seems that a person who can appreciate subtle music is often quite incompatible with the kind of loud music.</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Three years of military training were not entirely in vain. Director Xiong was ashamed and turned his anger into action, and immediately threw the poor woman down again. This time, he used even more force. The woman was thrown to the ground with her limbs splayed, her face upturned, and she lay on the ground for a long time, unable to move, panting like an ox.</p>
<p>"Good!" Many heartless people shouted from the sidelines.</p>
<p>Zhang Chang couldn't help but feel a surge of anger, and immediately shook off Feifei's hand and stepped forward.</p>
<p>"Hey! Little Zhang! Little Zhang!..." Lu Qian, who was standing behind him, was afraid that he would cause trouble and hurriedly wanted to stop him.</p>
<p>"Woo...woo..." However, the air raid siren was louder and more effective than his shouts. Not only had Zhang Chang, who was about to rush up to fight for justice, stopped, but also the fat woman lying on the ground immediately struggled to get up like a rolling ball. Director Hou and his wife, who were already sitting in the driver's seat, didn't have time to automatically let go of their superior seats that they had just taken and hurriedly jumped out of the car. Director Tai and Company Commander Liu were busy leading them to run to the nearby air-raid shelter. The idlers and people in the car also fled in the chaos by seventy or eighty percent. The serious invasion of the Japanese planes in the past two days has frightened the Guilin people, who have never been very afraid of air raids.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaonian, who was fully responsible for the troupe, was busy directing everyone to get off the bus and let Lu Qian lead the way to hide in the air-raid shelter first. He and the worker Lao Huang stayed in the car to guard the things.</p>
<p>Soon, the emergency alarm sounded again.</p>
<p>"What! You didn't leave?" At this time, Lao Zhu realized that the original Zhang Chang, with a face full of anger, was standing next to the driver's seat like a stone statue. His eyes were wide open, staring at the crowd running around in front, and his chest seemed to contain infinite grief and indignation.</p>
<p>Lao Zhu saw that he didn't speak, so he jumped out of the car and gently patted him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>"Did what you just saw make you angry, you scholar?"</p>
<p>The young man in his twenties still did not answer.</p>
<p>"The enemy planes are coming soon! They will really bomb indiscriminately these two days!" Lao Zhu looked at him and said very kindly, with some meaning of persuasion, but his right hand was groping in his trouser pocket for the candy that he seemed to remember was left.</p>
<p>"Let them bomb! Let them bomb to their heart's content, bomb away these scum! Bomb away these waste products! This country of China is really too rotten! We need a thorough sweep! Otherwise, we would rather all die!" Zhang Chang, whose blood was boiling with anger, clenched his fists tightly, looked up at the sky, and roared like a lion, with flames spraying from his eyes.</p>
<p>Lao Zhu didn't find the candy, and wiped his lips with his hand.</p>
