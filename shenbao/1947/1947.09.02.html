<h3>遠東局勢日趨急迫　美將修改對華政策　王外長定六日飛紐約出席聯大會　朝鮮問題我決參加討論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕我出席聯合國第二次大會代表團首席代表王世杰外長，定日自滬乘泛美航空公司巨型客機飛紐約赴會，外部條約司長胡育，情報司長張長祿等隨行，聞王氏除出席聯大二次會外，並將就韓國問題及日本問題與各國首要有所接觸。</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕外部一日晨以覆文送交美駐華大使館，對美政府邀請參加議，討論朝鮮問題一事，表示同意。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓卅一日合衆電〕此間外交官員咸認爲，今後四個月，將成爲歷史上有關遠東事務之最重要時期，彼等指陳，該時期內所採取之決定，將形成該地區事項之久遠趨向，日本·朝鮮及中國均將成爲此富有歷史性動盪中衆所注意之國家，印尼·越南及印度，亦將受同等注意。盟國關於日本和約之初度討論，「可能於九月舉行」，將成爲戰勝盟國意圖轉變日本國內前途之初步程序，該項討論亦將表現英·美·蘇在遠東方面是否仍有合作之可能，如蘇聯堅持惟英·美·中·蘇四強應參加草擬日本和約工作，則遠東委會之之其他九會員國，將不顧蘇聯而逕自舉行討論。此問官員指出上述情形，雖不忍公開決裂，然目前時局迫急，所有參加對日作戰國家，於必要時竟至寗願拋棄蘇聯之合作也。觀乎美國目前一般觀念及政策，朝鮮問題，預料於本秋提交聯合國大會，此間人士認爲美國之放棄與蘇聯在朝鮮統一問題謀求協議，面另主張於十月八日在華府召開四强會議討論該問題，實僅係趨向聯合國之另一步驟，蓋美，蘇兩國旣不能獲致協議，則四强更不可能獲致協議也。官方人士認爲，美國之提讓召開四强會議，實乃外交方策中之另一步驟，旨在於提交聯合國解決，朝鮮僵局，則探測一切可能之解決方案而已。至於中國問題，中國於今後八週內，將獲得關於其請求美國增加經濟援助之答覆，魏德邁考察團料將於九月中旬返華府，消息靈通人士一致認爲，十月間美國對華政策定將有所修改。至於印尼問題，此間外交界人士及政府官員，對於安理會之能使該問題獲得和解之效力一端，頗表懷疑，大多數美國官員認爲，印尼之拒絕美國斡旋，實屬錯誤，彼等不但失去獲得同情性之斡旋，反而使美國官員轉而企求加强西方國家之地位。</p>
<h3>美將領在日會商　太平洋空軍戰略　B50型轟炸機即將出現</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京一日電〕麥克阿瑟與美國高級空軍　員之太平洋空軍戰略會議，一日繼續舉行，外界揣測紛紜，謂渠等會商乃在對蘇美關係發動外交壓力。美戰略空軍司令凱尼上將，爲調査全球空軍設備，於三十一日抵達此間後，立即與麥克阿瑟舉行會議，美遠東空軍司令懷特海中將，第五空軍司令吳爾夫中將，亦偕同自菲律賓抵此，渠等與其他兩軍事領袖作密談。據消息靈通軍界人士稱：美空軍在汎北極區之飛行試騐，遭遇困難甚多，其結果使美國戰略必須加以修正，而同時將其他啣接歐亞及美國之空軍航路加以考慮。</p>
<p>中國國內局勢之日趨緊張，加以美蘇關於朝鮮獨立問題之衝突，乃爲美國衙新注意太平洋空軍實力之兩項理由。對於東方事件有經２之觀察家稱；美國在東方之威信，有賴於其足以應付緊急事能之軍事實力者實大，美國空軍早已有意其B20　而設之戰略空軍基地存在於日本，菲律賓，關島，瓜甲論及冲繩島等地。</p>
<p>英國亦擬擴充其在新加坡之空軍設備，建２一萬九千呎之空軍滑道，足够行駛最大型ｐ　炸機．　尼在抵菲律賓前，已在倫敦與英國皇家空軍領補舉行　商，美國轟炸機停留此項主要機塲，即能在東亞散布空軍實力鋼。該項飛機一旦　有緊急事變，亦可從該處迅速飛機至位於中國腹地成都之鹿大美國戰時建築之　塲，從成都美國飛機能控制中央亞洲之心機。據美空軍官員稱：B29型機，不久即將以大加改進飛　較戰時重轟炸機約近團倍之B50型機代替。</p>
<p>據悉：美戰略空軍現正組織一長飛程之戰鬥機隊，其中擬利用飛程達一萬五千哩之雙翼馬斯當P82型機，此項飛機最近曾自檀香山作不停留飛行，抵達梅因蘭。空軍專家稱：該項飛機在五年至七年內，由於仍在試駝階段中之新型長飛程噴射式轟炸機及戰鬥機之出現，而變爲落伍，陸軍航空隊早有P8080型之噴射式戰鬥機駐紮於西太平洋各島上。</p>
<h3>北塔山前綫　蒙軍圖進犯</h3>
<p>我正嚴密戒備中</p>
<p>〔中央社北塔山八月卅一日急電〕截至本日下午二時止，我前綫視察哨已發現蒙軍新增人數，至少已達五百人左右，汽車六七輛來往，甚爲怱忙，其步哨綫並向我方陣地略爲移動，且向左右伸張，似有進犯企圖。我軍正嚴密戒備中。</p>
<h3>政治經濟改革　將有嚴竣措施</h3>
<p>〔路透社南京一日電〕據關係方面稱，蔣主席夫婦在牯小住返京後，即將頒布施行若干嚴峻的政治及經濟改革措施。</p>
<h3>三黨提名候選　談判猶無結果</h3>
<p>民社黨發言人表示</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨自張君勱返滬後，昨日午後三時起召開中常會，至六時許始散。會後該黨發言人表示：「關於南京普選之談判，迄未有具體結果。政府方面希望三黨將候選人儘量提出，以後再由三黨合組審査委員會，交換意見並進行審査工作。故在本日常會中，並未討論候選人之名單問題。同時一部份常委有鑒於廣州，北平最近市參議會選舉之實際情形，對於該黨之參加大選，頗有表示消極者。」又關於該黨府委政委空額問題，昨日會中亦有討論，決定在短期內暫不提出，將來仍可能由海外代表擔任。</p>
<h3>孫立人赴台南</h3>
<p>〔本報台北一日電〕孫立人一日晨九時飛台南，視察二〇五師靑年軍及地方情形，三日回台北飛穗。</p>
<h3>牯嶺秋意正濃　主席游步山林　昨偕夫人參觀圖書館</h3>
<p>〔本報牯嶺一日電〕牯嶺市民因蔣主席曁夫人之蒞臨莫不鼓舞歡欣。贛主席王陵基於卅一日登山後，即擬籌備於一日舉行一盛大之歡迎會，恭請主席訓示，唯主席表示不願有所舖張故即中止舉行。由廬山管理局吳局長籌備於三日舉行之慶祝勝利大會，亦將從簡。主席於晨九時，偕夫人赴廬山圖書館，傳習學舍，廬山大禮堂等處參觀，旋返官邸。下午三時偕夫人沿大林路循花徑至仙人洞遊覽，六時許始返。主席夫婦出遊時，係乘肩輿，歸途中，夫人乘輿先回，主席至中心學校時即下興步行，巡視街頭並向隨行之吳仕漢局畏垂詢今春大火情形，然後返官邸休息。主席今着長袍馬褂，戴其去歲在牯常戴之鴨舌帽，夫人着紅色絨絲衣西服。今日山中秋意正濃，大霧瀰天，十步之外不能見人。晚未出，僅在草地略作山嵐之流覽，山中景色因而倍覺平靜。</p>
<h3>張羣評魏使聲明　甚多事情魏氏未盡明瞭　若干改革須待行憲以後</h3>
<p>〔合衆肚南京一日電〕行政院院長張羣一日單獨接見合衆社記者時宣稱，中國政府不因魏德邁使團訪華之結果，而改變其國內及外交政策。張氏並稱：「有甚多事情，魏德邁將軍並不知道。」當魏氏訪問中國時期，渠曾與魏氏會晤多次，而魏氏並未與渠舉行「重要」會議。蓋魏氏對政府以外之人物較政府人員爲着重也。</p>
<p>張氏稱，魏氏臨別文吿中所建議之各點改革，在其訪華前，政府已予實行，而魏氏認爲渠離開中國不久，仍極熟悉中國情形。有許多人頗欲謁見魏特使而不可得，職是之故，魏氏並未獲悉許多事情。魏氏自其顧問獲得許多帮助，或許魏氏認爲該項資料已經足够。渠與魏氏私誼極深，並明瞭其好意，但魏氏以「美國總統特使身份」所發表之文吿，引起中國人民間許多批評。渠希望一般批評能明瞭魏氏之好意及魏氏能了解批評其文吿之人士。</p>
<p>記者詢問「張院長所稱，中國不因魏德邁使團訪華結果而改變其國內與外交政策，是否渠不同意魏氏之意見，即中國必須實行激烈而無所不及的政治及經濟改革」之謂？張氏答稱：「中國在新成立之憲法及未來大選中已規定此項所決定者「逐步」實行，細小事情不應與政策事情混在一起。此乃係方法問題也。中國之政策乃固定者，不擬改變其國內或外交政策」。</p>
<p>「吾人之美國朋友稱，中國政府無效率，吾人正在硏究改進方法。吾人明白吾人曾自美國與西方國家學得甚多，但在中國實行改革將牽涉到許多事情諸如習慣，制度及手續。但此非吾人不擬改革目前行政之謂也，吾人現有許多事可做，但許多事情必須等候。</p>
<p>例如吾人頗知訓政之不佳，吾人正在儘早結束之。但在憲法實施前，不宜結束訓政。許多同樣之改革，須等到憲法實施之後。</p>
<p>張氏又稱，自政府改組之後，政府之責任更爲重大，工作更形繁重，而主要者乃在集中一切力量引導憲政之實施。</p>
<p>雖則有許多障碍，政府決定在本年度完成此工作。有許多人民對政府是否眞正欲在今秋舉行大選表示懷疑，並認爲大選因內戰勢將展延。</p>
<p>張氏繼稱：，「吾人政策是舉行大選，政府將不瞰一切障碍，不予改變政策。」</p>
<p>張氏又述及關於「美國友人」對商人最感頭痛之進出口條例批評稱，政府感覺此事甚有進步，但外國之批評不能使此項條例在一晚間即得改變。</p>
<p>張氏末稱，中國政府對魏德邁使團之意見已於魏德邁使團離華前數日交與魏氏。此可代表渠個人及中國政府之意見。</p>
<h3>青年黨全代大會　今聽取黨政報告</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕靑年黨第十一屆第一次全國代表大會昨日在滬開幕，上午十時舉行常乃惪追悼會，故大會正式會議於下午舉行，由曾琦主席，當經選出曾琦，左舜生，余家菊，何魯之，陳啓天，夏濤聲，林可璣，于復先，鄭振文九人爲主席團。昨日出席各地代表二百餘人，常委李璜因病請假。今日上午續開大會，由左舜生，陳啓天等作政治報吿，午後由各地代表作黨務報吿。</p>
<h3>對日和約　我草案內容　共五大部分一百廿餘條</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕我於對日和約草案之擬訂工作，已臨最後階段，現除若干有關賠償及其他技術方面問題待決外，和約草案大致完稿，俟對日和約草案審議委員會於最短期間加以審議補充，並經國民黨四中全會討論後，即將提請當局及中樞重要會議，俾作最後確定，以作對日和會上我國之具體主張。</p>
<p>和約草案初稿係由外交部對日和約起草委員會於去歲元成，至今已經兩度修正。外交當局對此極爲重視，兩年來已以最高之效率及極度之周密，完成此項重要工作。草案之內容，外交部迄仍保守秘密，拒不發表。唯據本報記者根據一般條約之要件，自各權威來源經月探訪，和約草案計分五大部份，約一百二十餘條，外附附件若干，規定特殊問題之技術細節。茲擇要縷誌如下</p>
<p>（一）前言：闡述和約之意義，在於完成此次戰爭在法律上之結束，澈底根除日本之侵略性能，重建遠東及世界和平。</p>
<p>（二）領土條款：大致根據開羅宣言，波茨坦協定之規定，並以日本行政區域管理方案（佔領日本盟眾總部擬訂）作爲參考。日本之領土將以其主要四島及其近週之小島爲限。台灣，澎湖列島，韓國，庫頁島，千島羣島，琉球羣島，馬紹爾等三託管羣島，及小笠原羣島之地位，均有具體之規定</p>
<p>（三）政治條款：日本之侵略性之思想精神及政治體系，一律消除。國民敎育及再敎育之讀物，必須嚴密審訂，終止侵略思想之灌輸。武士道，黑龍會等黷武精神之社會團體必須根除。足資構成侵略實力之財閥體系，必須改革，接受管制。趨向民主之政治改革，必須確實推行。</p>
<p>（四）賠償條款：日本賠償之客體，包括工業生產設備及製成品。其可保留之工業，限於直間接均不能造成侵略勢力之民生工業。國民之生活水準，應照目前情况，予以最低之估定。賠償必須完全履行。我國應獲得之賠償額，至少應在百分之四十以上。日本爲侵略目的在海外所爲之一切公私貸款及建設等資產，槪予無條件廢除或沒收，如西原貸款及其曾佔領各地之建設等。</p>
<p>（五）軍事條欽：日本之軍備須全部裁除，不得保留任何陸海空軍之武力，及任何直間接有關之軍備工業。日本國內秩序由警察維持，警察僅得配備小型武器，其軍火進口亦依一定需用量加以限制。和約簽訂後，由主要盟國組織管制委員會、軍事佔領及民政監督，同時繼續進行，其期限直至和約之完全履行，及民主取代侵略之時爲止。其用費悉由日本負担。</p>
<p>附件中之最主要者，爲領土條款實施之規定，賠償程序及賠償品之處理技術之規定，海外資產清理之規定，管制委員會之組織任務之規定等。</p>
<p>據權威人士語記者：我對日和約採取之主要原則，爲根除其與侵略有關之種種因素，同時仍予其國民以和平民主之生在機會，全部和約草案悉本此訂成。我國受日本之害最鉅且久，對日本了解亦最爲深刻，而今後自不願再受其害，故所有主張之目的，均在使日本澈底放棄侵略，且熊以一民主和平之新國家，重行參加國際社會，對遠東及世界之安寗有所貢獻，藉贖前愆。</p>

<p>〔路透社東京一日電〕消息靈通方面人士謂日圓對美元之比率，不久將調整爲一百三十日圓對美金一元。按在戰爭爆發前，匯率爲日金四圓合美金一元，戰後明軍進駐時盟軍以美元兌換日金之非正式兌換率規定爲十五日圓合美金一元，英美佔領軍當局爲制止黑市活動頒發軍票後，日圓兌換率經調整爲五十圓合美金一元。日本經濟新聞雜誌今年七月佔計，日圓在東京之眞正價値，當時應爲一百四十八圓合美金一元，黑市價格則在一百至一百五十圓之間。</p>
<h3>我在東北所遭困難　邱吉爾應負重責　戰略失策造成今日僵局</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京一日電〕在雅爾達協定簽訂兩年後之今日，若干中國人士聲稱：邱吉爾對中國政府在東北之困難，應負最火之責任。以前羅斯福總統素被目爲應負大部責任，惟目下中國歷史學者多指責邱吉爾爲大罪人。緣由邱氏在一九四三年反對開闢第二戰綫，如依羅斯福之計劃第二戰綫開闢於一九四三年，蘇聯可能不致參加對日作戰，蘇聯即使參戰，至少其代價亦應較低。一九四五年春，羅斯福，史達林及邱吉爾簽訂雅爾達協定，買取蘇聯參加對日作戰，此協定强迫中國將若干帝俄在華之特權移交蘇聯，例如共管中長鐵路，蘇聯利用旅順港作爲海軍基地，大連港半數設備無代價在三十年內租與蘇聯等。中國人士回憶稱：美國曾繕就計劃，於一九四三年渡英法海峽進攻歐陸，邱氏本同意此計劃，後忽建議先攻北非及義大利，羅氏在邱氏保證一九四四年攻歐陸後，乃吿同意。邱氏所以進攻地中海及巴爾幹區，其主要理由純屬政治謀略，邱氏之計劃爲戰略上一大失策，蓋一九四三年希魔在法比荷蘭僅有廿九師團，而一九四四年則有五十八師。此外，邱氏所畏懼之德國第六軍團，一九四三年已被蘇聯擊潰，故結論爲：如第二戰綫在一九四三年開闢，戰事可提早一年結束，人力物力之損失亦可减少。美國對日作戰亦可增加信心，人力及武備。如此，盟國不必「乞求」蘇聯參戰，而中國現時當巳整個收復東北矣。</p>

<h3>在華沙紅色舞台上　跳躍着的人物（續昨）　波蘭行第四信</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>以後，我沒有在國際宣傳處提到這件事，臨離開前幾天，我們的大使館還替我打了一次電話，回答是「戈墨卡先生暑期休假去了，恐怕無法接見貴國的記者」。我因爲參觀工廠，學校等等事忙。後來也就忘記了這事。</p>
<p>戈墨卡是一個化學工人出身的共產黨員，克里姆林宮的最忠實的「同志」，由於他往昔常常被捕和牢獄生涯，他懂得政治鬥爭的訣巧，也比別人爲多。許多波蘭人講他陰深，毒辣，有人將他比作波蘭的維辛斯基。有位波蘭外交部的朋友　我說：戈墨卡決不是史　林那樣的人物，他還說：「如今在波蘭共產黨裏邊最有力量的人，不是戈墨卡，而勃耳曼，因爲勃耳曼控制着波蘭的「武般」！」　「武般」就是波蘭的特務，我不知道這組織隸屬於共產黨？抑或隸屬於政府？在鐵　背後，作爲一個外國新聞記者的，實在不甚相宜去尋根究底。我沒有會見過勃耳曼，首相官邸遊園會那天，也沒有人提到過勃耳曼的名字。</p>
<p>除了這些人以外，在波蘭的紅色圈子中，還有工業部長閔斯，一個有學者風度，頭腦非常細密的共產黨員。有人說：閔斯是猶太人，也有人說他的祖宗之中有猶太人的血！</p>
<p>納粹征服波蘭的五年當中，猶太人犧牲得最慘酷。希特勒的嘍囉們，殺猶太人，常常五百一千，用機關槍亂掃，實在是慘無人道到極點。如今希特勒被打敗了，猶太人又回到了波蘭，而且也相當的獲得了「要津」。在波蘭的言論自由下，講猶太問題常常被限制住的，我知道波蘭農民黨的「洛獨瓦」日報上，有一篇關於猶太的專論被檢扣。</p>
<p>我不十分注意這一問題，但大概曉得，波蘭在載前三千二百萬人口之中，曾經有過五百萬猶太人，猶太人和波蘭之間的歷史，可以寫一本專審。大抵，戰前波蘭的經濟，都控制在猶太人手裏，華沙附近的許多「消夏」的別墅，戰前幾乎淸一色都是猶太人的，現在改成了許多「托兒所」，「肺病療養院」和「兒童病院」等等。</p>
<p>現在在波蘭的猶太人，沒有確實統計，大槪說：二千三百萬戰後波蘭人中，最多不到五十萬人。波蘭政府現在在竭方磨滅猶太人與非猶太人的界限，因此，也不願在興論上多揭示猶太人問題。我在華沙的逗留期中，曾經出席過一次猶太民族領袖史奈克博士的招待會，他剛從巴勒斯坦回來，專門負責蘇俄以及鐵簾裏面的外交工作，即在史奈克博士演講了一點多鐘，最重要的一價中心意思，是打倒大英帝國在中東近東的統治！</p>
<p>那天招待的茶點非常豐厚，到座的除外國記者，波蘭記者以外，還有很多捧塲的波蘭猶太人。史奈克博士用波蘭話演講，波蘭的國際宣傳處，特地爲我派了一位小姐翻譯，因爲全塲的人，都懂波蘭話，祗有我一個例外。</p>
<p>我時刻感謝華沙當局對我的厚意，在下篇通訊中，我更要特別介紹他們。（完）</p>

<h3>青年團幹監聯席會　定期在牯嶺舉行　當國統一組織明年五五前完成</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕靑年團幹，監事聯席會議定五日揭幕，會預定三日，由蔣團長親自主持，開將在牯嶺舉行，出席人員有四日飛潯說。</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕關於黨國統一組織之實施時期，外傳將自四中全會閉幕後開始，青年團立即合併於黨內，故若干入土均認爲：最近召開之黨團聯席會議將爲辦理團務結束之最後一次會。記者頃訪青年團中央屬部副書記長鄉產，探詢其實施辦法，承談中央確定黨團統一組織，並非使黨團合併，亦非將黨團混合，而是團員滲入黨內，使其發生新的革命力量，此項工作過程，須一相當時期，在國民黨七全代會揭幕時可能完成，七全代表大會之舉行日期，約爲卅七年五月五日，是則黨團統一組織工作之完成，將在明年五月五日前。</p>
<h3>陳嘉庚在星　對記者談話</h3>
<p>〔本報特派員吳嘉棠新嘉坡一日電〕此間華僑領袖陳嘉庚氏，對由滬過星之記者團談稱：「中國希望能有一第三黨出而號召民衆，重建和平」。陳氏相信此一黨派必在生長中，但不知其領袖爲何人。陳氏拒不批評蔣主席，但謂身爲一國領袖者，要必能爲民衆謀福利而爲民衆所擁戴者。陳氏談及華僑之團結問題時稱：國內之局勢一日不變，僑胞之思想衝突將一日不止，如果中國團結一致，則僑胞必能一體擁護之。陳氏拒絕批評華僑左派及右派人士之實力比較，但渠信華僑中百分之八十均贊成中國民主化。陳氏告記者稱：渠並未加入任何黨派，因渠「旣不能領導他人，亦不願爲人領導也。」渠對於國大代表之選舉一事，　不感興趣，渠信對於此事發生興趣者，僅少數人耳。陳氏認爲中國顧應採取一種旣非親美亦非親蘇之政策。「地廣人稠如中國之國家，應有獨立之外交政策，不應對任何國家心有畏懼，武力征服世界之事已成過去矣！」中國國內局勢使其不能成爲亞洲各小國之盟主而翼衛之，渠對此深表遺憾。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>遠東基本敎育的基本問題</h3>
<p>聯合國文敎組織遠東區基本敎育會議，定於明日在我國首都開慕，會期十日，預定於十二日閉幕，參加會議者除聯合國文敎組織代表而外，尙有中國·印度·暹羅·菲律濱·澳洲·紐西蘭·不丹·尼泊爾·緬甸·錫蘭·與馬來亞等十餘國代表，誠爲遠束學術文化界的一大盛會。我們除以地主之誼，向各國代表表示熱烈歡迎而外，並願乘此機會，檢討一下遠東區基本敎育的幾個基本問題，以供各國代表之參考，</p>
<p>基本敎育並不是件新事業，自有人類，卽有敎育，有敎育卽在培養兒童和成人讀書識字，以及各種方式的生活。吾國的六藝敎育，西洋的三育敎育，就是朝向這條路走的敎育。誠如聯合國文敎組織發言人稱：「用基本敎育這名詞，是因爲想把兒童敎育和成人敎育兩個觀念，都包括在內，指出這種敎育，不僅敎人讀，寫，算，且授以若干基本東西，使他們可以謀生，改良他們經濟情况，表達自己，改善衛生環境，參加國內國際政治活動，藉以引導走向此較充實而完善的生活。一</p>
<p>此次會議籌籌備已歷三月，我國專家苦心孤詣，準備一套「出色」的材料，據各方報導所知，他們計劃的材料，包括語言，文字，敎學，閱讀，識字訓練的技術及工具。</p>
<p>但據我們的看法，遠東基本敎育的基本問題，不在乎技術。而在乎態度，不在乎方法，而在乎政策。改善了外人對遠東的態度，改善了外人對遠東的政策，遠東各國的基本敎育，不解決而自解決。拉鐵摩爾曾謂：「美國人理解所要理解的問題，有若干障礙。其中最大者，就是我們的習慣，把歐洲放在一切念頭之上；我們若把政治思想轉移到菲洲和亞洲，我們的習慣，仍是從歐洲方而想過去。」我們害怕遠東基本敎育會議，亦以歐洲爲出發點，並以歐洲做中心，假使犯了這個錯誤態度，遠東的基本敎育障礙自多。</p>
<p>遠東基本敎育會議參加的單位，有中國，澳洲·印度·印尼·緬甸·越南·朝鮮·馬來亞·新西蘭·菲律濱·暹羅·不丹·尼泊爾·阿富汗·錫蘭等十五國，這十五國中除三四國外，多屬待解放的殖民地，半殖民地或附屬國，西洋人慣喜稱它們爲「熱帶的遠東」。與歐洲多多少發生密切關係。會議時務必力避以歐洲人的眼光來看遠東，而應力求以遠東本位來看遠東。假使幾百年來這個遠東幾萬萬人民的政治歷史和經濟命運，不決定於遠東圈外，遠東的基本敎育，絕對不會發生像今日的問題。</p>
<p>遠東多的是文明古國，有的是人類早期燦爛的文化，歷史曾證明遠東人種，並不低劣；在新時代以前：卽西洋勢力未伸到遠東之前，敎育在遠東是普及的，是爲着生活而敎育，爲着文化而敎育，具有社會的經濟的宗敎的價値。美國遠東專家富尼萬說過：「十九世紀後半葉前，熱帶遠東有了學校，識字的人數，多過同時代的歐洲。」</p>
<p>西洋政治家想以敎育變換東方社會，可是社會的變換不是由於敎育而由於經濟的力量，而且這個新的社會反變換了敎育的素質。大羣大羣的人民，不能與西方文化接觸，在表層的下面，普遍地燃燒了反抗西方的怒火。時代之輪，踏進到現在，效率與社會公平，代替了自由主義：同時，帝國主義呈現着强弩之末的現象，這種傾向反應於殖民政策，在英國發表「白人負担」主義，包括着新的政治哲學和一個倫理的標準。荷蘭殖民政治家倡導了「倫理」政第：法國殖民學說以「聯合」代替「同化」。新政策對於敎有變換了態度，視敎育爲經濟進步和人類福利的主要工具。廿世紀初，新敎育政策的主要方面，漸漸形成了。它的目的，特別在發展基本敎育和專業敎育。又在着重於女子敎育和成人敎育。可見這種新敎育未實施前，已起了民族主義，民族主義者之視之育與政府大不相同，政府以敎育爲經濟的，而不是文化的：爲的是生存，而不是爲生活，敎兒童如何謀生，而不敎如何生活，失去了敎育的價値？要之，今日速東基本教育的基本問題，不在方法與按術：却在態度與政策。態度與政策不改善，方法與技術儘管好，還被束縛得一籌莫展，望出席代表放眼看這個遠東的基本教育</p>

<p>猶阿兩國所簽訂之經濟同盟條約，應包括設立閱稅同盟，基於共同利益之貨幣兌換制度，鐵路公路郵電之聯運，海發，加發兩港之共同使用，以及水利土地工程之共同發展等。組織並管理此一經濟同盟之機構，爲一聯合經濟委會由猶阿兩國各派代表三人，會同聯合國經社理事會任命之外國委員三人合組之。耶城特度期內，置國際託管之下，以聯合團機構爲洽　理當局，其區域包括現有之市區及附近各村鎭。聯合國特委會之三委員，印度·伊朗及南斯拉夫，則贊成設聯邦獨立國，以耶城爲國都，澳洲代表於表決時，對於前兩制度均棄權。</p>
<p>在分治制度下，猶太國之土地應包括迦列里之東部，艾斯特拉隆平原，沿海平原之大部份，及包括尼日勃之整個比爾許巴區。阿拉伯國將包括迦列里之西部，沙馬里亞及茹達區，及南部沿埃及邊界之平原。</p>

<h3>西安滬漢間客貨聨運前夕　隴海路在改進中</h3>
<p>— 本報西安八月廿五日航訊　記者李馳</p>
<p>隴海綫上第八號　木架便橋　折服外籍工程師</p>
<p>〔本報西安廿五日訊〕以驚人之工程折服了外籍工程師之隴海路第八號木架便橋，其全部工程刻已冒險完成，計長一百十八尺，高四十二公尺。該橋架之一部，業經改建三合土鋼筋水泥大橋，交通則迄未一日或斷也。</p>
<p>隴海鐵路艾起連雲港，西迄天水，全程一千六百餘公里，為我國最長之東西向鐵路幹綫。然因戰時戰後屢遵天災人禍破壞，潼（慶）洛（陽）段及天（立）寶（鷄）段均係倉促修築，故全綫迄未貫通，即能通車者亦時運時輟。然九個月來，自新局長莫衡履任後，銳意整理，全綫中十六公斤之輕軌首先全部抽換，並換新枕木達廿萬根，取消潼關陜州間便橋便道而代標準橋道。咸（陽）銅（川）支綫改善路綫，並完成同官隧道。凡以上所述，工資共達四五百億元！隴海綫之局部面目，從茲一新。惟芳謂澈底整理，暢通全綫，則尙待左列各項進行中工程之完成。請先自西端起略述之：</p>
<p>寳天鐵路長僅百公公里、然有隧道百廿座，平均</p>
<p>一里一洞工程之可見，於茲可見。復以該段內坡度甚大，全綫背山面水，蜿蜒構築於沙土崗巒間。興建時，限於人力財力時間，隧道不得不儘量减短，隧道口之應築爲甬道者亦代以「露天通道」（Open　Cut），且兩側坡度距離標準之一自然斜坡」（Natural　Slope）角度甚遠，故每屬雨季來臨，或受行車靈動而兩側砂土下塌者，爲不可避免之司空見慣。故寳天段塌方之多，爲全國鐵道之首位，去年間共淸理塌方四十餘萬方，今年又有十餘萬方。近旬陜甘雨季來臨，僅此數日，塌方已達四萬方。目下雖加緊淸理，然淸而復塌，亦意中事。澈底解決，恐非短期內所能實現。然該段員工始終盡力以赴。</p>
<p>人與天鬥今秋雨季完結後當可復通。</p>
<p>陜豫交界之潼關隧道，戰時被日軍隔河砲轟數百發，洞受震動，發生裂痕，年來勉强用木架支撑，當非安全久計。今夏五月，着手另挖新隧道，長達四六八公尺，近因風陵渡有戰事影響，延至下月上旬始可竣工。」</p>
<p>陜州以東至鄭州間三百公里路軌，係勝利後臨時凑集而成，式樣之雜堪稱「世界鐵軌展覽會」其影響行車速率安全者至鉅。段內十六公斤輕軌雖已換畢，然尙有六十磅，六十五磅等雜軌參混其間，刻預計本年底全部換舖</p>
<p>標準重勒以加强載重量。</p>
<p>硤石驛與觀音堂兩站間（屬河南澠池縣），有長凡百十公尺高達四十公尺之大橋一座，即通稱「八號橋」者是。前以急謀通車，故冒險架設木橋，惟限於載重量，故用小型機車僅能牽引二百噸列車通過。換言之，徐州鄭州間每列車爲千二百至千五百噸者，至此蜂腰幽道，非分爲六七七列車不可，影響運輸量與速率均大。今年五月，着手改建，利用原有鋼樑加以修整，築造洋灰大橋。又因此正式大橋築於便橋相同位置上，爲維持便橋繼續通車，僅能抽空架木一部，隨即建築鋼筋洋灰橋墩支持，工程程序，煞費苦心。目下已完成全工事十之九，預計下月中旬竣工。</p>
<p>洛陽以東之黑石關，孝義兩站間，亦有一大橋以横越洛河，共七孔，長凡三百十公尺，爲開海路之最長者。其間</p>
<p>木架便橋上月底被水冲毁，日前僅用木船聯絡兩岸。預料九月底雨季終結前雖加緊修竣便橋，然即使通車，仍隨時可能再度冲毁。永久性之洋灰橋基早已完成，「聯總」撥給之鋼樑大部運抵上海，在滬搭架後，拆開運洛配裝，問題之解決，僅時間耳。</p>
<p>洛陽東至鄭州間尙有小便橋十數座，其三合土橋墩已次第興建，美加借款項下鋼樑五十六孔亦已由交部撥到，預計年內全部正橋竣工。如此</p>
<p>巨型機庫始能拖引長列車箱，暢通無阻。</p>
<p>開封以東之民權，小壩，商邱段，本月十日又遭破壞，然十六日已修復。</p>

<p>〔本報開封廿七日訊〕豫省前以穩定糧價，曾有禁運糧食出境之規定，近糧食部以本年麥收已過，糧食情形已趨好轉，飭將前訂辦法予以廢止具報，田糧處奉令後，以（一）本省匪氛猖獗，本年又復旱潦相臻，麥收時期豫東豫北遍遭奸匪洗刦，糧源正感緊縮，際此動員戡亂，大軍雲集，軍續補給驟形增加，如糧食解禁，勢必糧食外運，征購征借困難。（二）本省匪區已有五十餘縣，迭率軍事長官電令加緊封鎖糧食，倘一且解除，恐糧食轉輾資匪，防不勝防，影響民食事小，貽誤軍糧事大。（三）豫省年來糧食供求相應，糧食波動尙不劇烈，全賴禁運外省所致，現時東西鄰省，糧食價格均較本省爲高，苟准解禁，則民間食糧競相拋售外運，必致造成本省糧食恐慌，關係尤爲重大。（四）豫省縣與縣間，糧食自由疏通，迭經嚴令各縣遵辦，並無阻　運情事，基於以上各點，是以本省環境特殊，斟酌情形，仍有繼續實施禁糧出境之必要，特電覆糧部請暫緩解禁，以期防患未然云。</p>

<h3>兵役示範區　鎭江志願兵擁擠</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江八月卅日訊〕蘇省自開始募集志願兵後，因大江南北各縣，過去飽受共匪蹂躪，人民痛定思痛，亟願獻身國家，剿滅共匪，以弭亂源，故應募者極爲踴躍，聞截至目前止，全省已募集志願兵達二千零六十名。</p>
<p>據本報讀者關查：現已送至鎭江之新兵，因之　師管區指導法，其當營地之佈置，與夫新兵所用之日常用具，確已步入「軍隊學校化」之階段，此可於新兵所用之整潔之床舖，潔白之毛巾，以及整齊淸潔之炊事用具，覘其大槪。至於新兵之營養問題，亦可於若干膚色紅潤，精神飽滿之新兵面色，證明已獲適當之解決，但軍師管區之負責人，則並未引以自滿，仍擬逐步改良，以求不負此「兵役示範區」之榮譽頭銜。據悉：鎭江新兵之安家費，合一切計之，聞每名迄未超過五百萬元。鎭江新兵營內，有保長之愛子，有學校敎員，有大學生及中學生，有大商店內的職員，他們都是志願當兵，以行動擁護政府戡亂建國大計的，這是「兵役示範區」應有的好現象。</p>

<h3>張其昀敎授　昨在青年會演講　憂患裏的中國</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕七科學團體聯合年會，昨午後三時，假八仙橋靑年會大禮堂舉行公開演講，由名敎授張其昀主講，講題爲：「憂患裏的中國」，渠從政治地理學之觀點，討論中國邊疆問題，略謂旅大問題，自十九世紀末期以來，向爲東亞亂源。其影響可比地中海之君堡（伊斯坦堡）。戰後蘇聯對君堡有共同設防之要求，土耳其斷然拒絕，而中國則不能。現在旅大在軍事上爲東北三大半島（朝鮮·遼東·山東）國際共黨之活動中心，反之在經濟上則國際貿易迄今尙未開放，實際爲一死港。東北嚴重之形勢，較之九一八當年未曾少减。外蒙失地之大，過於東北，其人口僅八十萬，不及南京一市，本難以自成一獨立國，今居然侵我新疆，實爲大潮流中之一浪頭。新疆大局動盪不安，伊犂塔城阿山三區特殊化之形勢迄今未見改善，土耳其斯坦共和國之陰謀倘不加阻止，新疆恐成外蒙第二，後患無窮，西藏高度自治，去獨立僅差一間，金沙江以西，已鞭長莫及，最近西藏政變以後，離心力更加强。滇緬北段邊界至今尙未勘定，江心坡與戶拱谷地原屬中國，其地連繫中印二國，戰時曾於此築成公路，驅逐日寇，滇緬界務未可長此成爲懸案。海疆方面，廣州灣收回後，改爲湛江市，爲未來西南鐵道幹綫之出口要港。香港澳門陳舊之殖民地制度，亟須以和平談判，圓滿解決。台灣收回，海南建省，實爲我國恢復海權之大好機會。台灣淪陷半世紀，民旅意識依然强烈，最近發生事變，旨在改革內政，但在國際上已留下不良印象。要之，目前中國在內憂外患交迫之中，兩者因果相尋，而對蘇問題尤爲外交上第一難關。中蘇關係種種危機，均由於兩國國力之不平衡。若非舉國一致努力生產，認眞建設，無以充實國力，安內攘外。農林·漁收·礦產·水利·工業·交通·貿易·爲立國之九大綱領，東北·塞北·西北·西陲·西南·大河·長江·嶺南·海島·爲建設之九大區域，任何綱領，任何區域，倘有一稍形偏枯，即可釀成重大事變。救國無捷徑，外援不足恃，惟有統籌全局的生產建設，以求中外國力之平衡，方能確保主權，維護和平。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕昨日（一日）上午，中國地理學會，假上海醫學院舉行第一次論文會，到竺可楨等三十餘人，宣讀論文十餘篇。資源委員，礦產勘測處處長謝家榮會員，宣續大淮南盆地的礦產資源一文，略謂安徽準南煤礦，據近年勘測結果，知其儲煤量達十億噸以上，起過開渠煤礦，爲近年煤產方面最重要之發現，對長江下游工業化動力之供應，極爲重要云。</p>

<h3>吳市長嚴正表示　超收學費決以貪汚論罪　接受密告嚴予澈查懲處</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長爲本市有少數學校有超收學雜費情事，特於昨日下午五時半，在市府會客室內，招待各報記者，報吿四點如下：（一）各校下學期收費數額，市府已與各有關當局商討決定，任何學校一律不得超過，最近市府接獲各界之密吿信多件，對各校之濫收學費，有所檢舉，市府嚴予澈査，一經査明屬實，即懲戒之。（二）凡各學校以設備元善，成績優良，而請求增加學費數額者，在敎育局尙未核准以前，仍不得超收，否則市府決以貪汚論罪。深盼各校能首先表揚守法精神。（三）市府對於下學期之學費，首先訂定合理標準，同時舉辦獎學金，現已募得五十一億元，尙在積極進行中。下學期之學費，應該毫無問題。（四）本市最近突有「學生學業保障會」之成立，市政府根本不知其如何產生，且觀其內容皆似是而非，此種假借名義之不合法團體，市府自不容其存在，今後學生方面如有困難，儘可以私人炎格，向本人談判。</p>
<p>市府及敎局　成立調查組</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長曾召集私立中小學校長談話，當規定私校收費標準，以高中一百萬。初中八十萬，小學五十萬爲原則，但設備優良，歷史悠久，經濟公開之學校，得申請增收。此項規定公布後，一般學校紛紛要求增收。市府及敎局方面，爲嚴格執行規定起見，各派代表三人會同成立調査組三組，每組二人，至各校實地調査。調査項目有二：（一）請求依市府規定辦法增加者；（二）請求增收修建費者。據悉上週六已開始調査，規定每日調査二十校，全市被調査者共一百校，本週內可全部調査娩事。</p>
<p>希望各家長向政府檢舉</p>
<p>市政府緬訓令市敎育局云：「査本市本年度上學期開始在即，各私立中小學收費標準，業經規定，應即通令各校：（一）絕對不得超過規定收費；（二）其正收費而超過規定者，應即公告於開學時退還；（三）其聲請逾額徵收者，在未經該局核准以前，不得徵收超額，應俟核准後，將該局核准文件於校內公布補收；（四）凡不遵守規定之學校，即由該局令飭其校董會撤換其負責人，並規定期限具報，否則由該局派員代理。令仰該局切實遵照辦理，並隨時具報爲要！」又市敎育局發表公吿，略謂：「各私立中小學校最高納費標準，小學五十萬元，初中八十萬元，高中一百萬元，如有超出此數者，希望學生家長，以及社會各方面，多多欲舉。教局亦將派員密查，一經査出，定予嚴辦」云。</p>

<h3>折算手續今日商定以後　美金庫券即可發售　國行已奉到照美匯折算之命令</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕卅六年短期庫券，自經政院核定，按美匯市價折償本息後，該項命令，昨已正式頒到中央銀行。該行本擬於奉令後，即恢復按美匯市價發售短期庫券。惟以美匯市價，不能逐日變更。是以在通知各地分支行處，劃一辦理時，技術上不無困難發生。總行劉副總裁，財部徐次長，公債司陳司長等，於昨日下午，爲此事曾會商一過，認爲技術上相當複雜，故討論後雖已獲有輪廓，惟尙待今日上午繼續商討，一俟獲有最後定論，預定明日起，短期庫券即可正式恢復發售。</p>
<p>又據人金債券募銷委會副秘書長范鶴言談稱；　府決定按美匯市價折價本息後，今後非僅人民對於政府維特債信之決心，可以益臻信仰，且。（一）引起人民購買債券之興趣。（二）大量游資將因此有回籠機會。（三）美金庫券三億元之募銷，當益趨舒暢。倘將來增加發行額，或有發行其他債券時，更可使人民樂於購買（四）外幣債券按照市價折償本息，實爲合理且穩妥之辦法，人民必可踴躍購買云。</p>
<h3>外匯市價依舊</h3>

<h3>訂購外棉欵　國行登記發還</h3>

<h3>銀根緊暗息高　華股賣多盤低</h3>
<p>華股昨吿盤低，銀根見緊，暗息提高，多空貼息達二角二分半及二角七，對敲大戶力事撳抑，買方雖極力掙扎，終以衆寡懸殊，近午盤跌不已，臨收多空谷出全力，疲後忽形恍惚，永紗而外更見鬆弛，頗難樂觀。</p>
<p>晨初以隔前交換國行仍有大量差進而開低，遞永紗開後，由一六〇號等賣到二四六元，一七一號等尙納，曾回漲到二五五元。此時信和亦由一五二號之力購，遞交曾達一四〇元高價。一六號等賣出而見回。</p>
<p>十時半後，塲外息價開高至二角二分半及二角七，間有高至二角四及二角七分半者，一六號等賣到二四六元，一八六號等俱進，回升二五二元。二七號等賣出，逐漸撳小，近午盤低至二三七元及二四一元低價。八號等乘低抬價，回升至二四七元。二三五號等脫手，午收以二三九元及二四五元價結束。</p>
<p>收後喊價平和，餘股亦被帶小，除永公新光最見穩健，結果較上週六計即交股信和華豐中法各跌半成左右，新華永紗美亞景福勤興微挫，新光平而永公微升，景綸跌半成，中紡微升，內衣平，餘均微降。遞交股計華豐跌半成，新光微升，永紗信和美亞景福勤興微挫，塲外各老股微挫者多。</p>
<h3>統債升外股古</h3>
<p>公倚昨以一般心理對美金庫券，政府旣作有信用之揹置，咸有樂觀氣氛。統丙晨開即已躍升至一八〇〇〇元，高價一八二〇〇元，盤低至一六五〇〇元結束，五五〇室及寳隆有買，三六〇室五〇三室二三〇室五五五室則出，成交約八百餘萬，較上週六計甲乙漲一千一，丙漲一千二，統丁升八百元，統戊好起一千三。</p>
<p>外股昨電話以籌碼少而搜羅者多，賡續在有利之氣氛中，趨漲甚多。小型股怡啤航業則不見有利，下跌較多，證券飾金號帮有供，銀行帮洋商均進。怡紗晨開八六五〇〇元，高價八九〇〇〇元，而復轉盤，結果較上週六計航業怡啤各跌半成，電話漲一成，英聯會德豐尙平，餘均微升而已。</p>
<h3>食糖依然緊秀</h3>
<p>昨糖市以台糖公司雖有續開，但人心甚佳，依然緊秀之局。二〇中砂白稍有現貨成交，好起二萬元許。汕提靑開升二萬弱，爲六十萬〇八千元。棉赤六十七萬元，計百數包。興化白袋裝高貨七十八萬五千元至七十七八萬元，簍裝七十四五萬元，興赤六十四五萬元，升萬餘元。次六十一二萬元，成交五六百件。海南赤六十七萬元至六十六萬五千元。刁靑仍開五十六萬元，計五十包。漳赤五十九萬五千元，稍有成交。</p>
<h3>食米市銷轉呆</h3>
<p>昨日南北市到黃見增，共計米糧九千六百餘石，秈米湘鄂皖贛均有到貨，市銷轉呆，新陳秈米猛跌一二萬元，新陳粳米隨之下挫萬元，白元亦跌萬元，形勢已入下游之象。麵粉照常配售，價格仍舊，麩皮供求兩平，價無榮辱。</p>
<p>豆餅客帮停辦，狂跌三四千元，黄豆去銷冷懈，挫落萬元，蠶豆依然平站，菉豆南洋續辦，欣欣向榮，步升萬元。</p>
<p>生仁走化淸淡，猛跌一二萬元，芝蔴新貨尙未見湧，暫呈穩定之格。元委上漲萬元，紅糧到銷兩稀，價無軒輊，苞米天津靑島暢納，飛騰二萬元。小麥來源見稀，廠方需用原料，納意尙貪，續加五千元。</p>
<p>油市照常配售，價無更動，塲內交易平常，生油平正，豆油疲萬元，淸油彷彿，菜油軟化，蔴油亦少上落。</p>
<h3>銀根仍緊　差入七二八億元</h3>

<h3>紡調會掛低紗價　廿支紗每件一千一百萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會昨日對棉紗議價，業將廿支紗掛低爲每件一千一百廿萬元，其餘各支紗綫，按照比例，並參酌市情，另行訂定。茲探誌昨日紡建開出甲組各支紗價如次（單位萬元）：</p>
<p>甲組：廿支天女一一二〇萬，廿二支公字一二〇〇萬，六支副日光五五〇萬，八支日光六三〇萬，十六支豐年九九五萬，卅二支仙桃一三八〇萬，卅二支雙股豐年一五四〇萬，卅二支三股八馬一四四〇萬，卅二支立馬一四二〇萬，卅二支雙股仙桃一四九〇萬，四十支藍鳳一六〇〇萬，四二支雙股立馬一八一〇萬，又水月一八五〇萬，六〇支日光二〇〇〇萬，六〇支雙股栗子二二四〇萬，八〇支雙股三八〇〇萬　昨日棉紗市况，因紡建照例開紗，掛價减低，更以銀根緊迫，浮多及散戶均不乏出籠，行情乃趨平疲。結果四二支籃鳳紗低至一千八百七十萬元，比週六回跌六十萬。廿支特雙馬及輕雙馬均跌十萬元，十六支光明粗紗平。</p>
<h3>紗商購得棉紗　限七日內出貨</h3>
<p>本市棉紗商業公會昨正式通知會員，凡紗廠所售棧單，必須於七日內出貨，否則即照原價收回。據稱：奉紡調會代電開，據報紡建公司代本曾售出之棉紗棧單，有在市塲買賣岡利情事，對目前紗價上漲，不無影響。茲規定上項售出紗廠棧單，限制出售交付棧單日起，七天內必須出貨。逾期不出，即照原價收回，幷以棧單內註明有效出貨期限。分電社會局及紡建公司外，相應電請運照云。</p>
<h3>紡建循例　配紗　加水災捐廿萬</h3>

<p>又六區棉紡公會通知該公司，自九月一日起，所售棉紗，每件除牌價外，代募兩廣，四川，及蘇北水災急賬經費廿五萬元。各講紗廠號，須按照准購單准購數量，逕向六區公會繳付，（按係南京路交通銀行代收），並領取收據，再憑收據及紗款收據，向繳款之銀行換取棧單。</p>
<h3>現棉軟弱</h3>
<p>昨日現棉市競爭，因銀根已緊，進意鬆懈，更以棉紗趨勢稍疲，人心軟弱，交易不旺，成交七百餘包。各檔做開送廠價１/16米特林二五三一萬，棧交價靈寳二二四萬，二二五萬，漢口細絨二〇三萬，周浦籽花三三萬三千。</p>
<h3>關棧積貨如何處理　輸管會正請示辦法</h3>
<p>關於前傳海關當局對於外匯新辦法施行後，堆存關棧之未辦妥進口手續貨物，將予官價收購一節，茲據進口業方面談稱，是項堆存關棧貨物，均非禁止輸入之物品，僅以黑市匯票訂購，未辦妥許可手續。且內中一部份亦曾持有許可證件，其堆存較久者，已達二三月，商人損失已感不貲，亟盼政府有一適當處置辦法。經向輸管會等有關機關磋商結果，已向上級機關請示，日內可望核定公佈。至外傳官價收購，以商人旣難義此重大損失，而海關爲維持政府信用，亦決不致擅自施行云。</p>
<p>王金上漲</p>
<p>本週五金貨價已較前漲上約一成，洋釘步昇，其中以美貨皮帶扣最好，二週內約漲上三成之鉅。</p>
<p>千疋。最近有一批運印，已裝五百箱，共一萬五千疋。</p>
<h3>外銷緣茶活動</h3>
<p>最得法屬摩洛哥垂靑之各種外銷綠茶，自上週由本市出口商紛向國外兜售以來，刻下已有一部份爲彼地需要，致沉靜多時之洋莊茶市，昨日市上死灰復燃，漸轉活動。且登塲頗久之本年度土莊珍眉，及路莊　源新大帮，均已開盤，計前者由怡和洋行吸進六百餘箱，價每担一百四十萬元，後者爲永興洋行開出，價每担扯一百七十萬元，市氣尙稱穩定，其他均小變化。</p>
<p>茲悉：目前午昌，華茶等公司，俱於與貨方磋商中，至於本年度祁門新紅茶，國外雖亦垂涎三尺，借嫌價昂，去化遂不活潑，交易仍見寥落，僅協和洋行搜進品質特上者卅三箱，價每担三百萬元，他若內銷花色，本街及客帮，走銷賡續平庸，市面依然缺乏顯著之變動。</p>
<h3>平厚呢堅俏</h3>
<p>平厚呢邇日市氣頗形軋俏，因全滬存底缺乏，同業各號握有存貨者無無幾，香港與日本均無運申，本廠又無能力織製，致有限底贊，供不敷求，行情賡續向榮，趨勢遠較其他各種呢羢爲堅秀。昨薄平呢每碼俱喊批四十萬元，厚平呢爲五十萬元，黄邊平厚呢成交價五十五六萬元，其他呢羢嗶嘰麥爾登行情，莫不因美匯關係，及毛料進口照市價揭算，齊多紛紛上升。</p>
<h3>棉楊限制輸入後　梗片產量減少</h3>
<p>我國火柴工業所需之梗子木材，向以美國輸入之棉楊爲主。自當局統制外匯以後，進口减少，致棉楊原料極感缺乏，各梗片廠不得不暫以採購國產本楊代用。然本楊質地鬆脆，製成粳子零亂易折，故各梗片廠除利用本楊製造梗子，以供各火柴廠需用，暫作過渡外，一面並請公會向當局由請木材輸入之外匯。</p>
<h3>北古物價回跌　　〔中央社北古一日電〕古市物價，因國家行局緊宿放款，物價突由漲轉跌。麵粉每袋降二三萬元，棉紗平均每件跌八十萬元，他如食糖食油等日用必需品，漲風均挫。中國鹽業公司　招募商股半數　　抗戰期間，敵寇所組織之華北及東北兩鹽業公司，勝利以後，即由財部派員接管，並改組中國鹽業公司。該公司遵照國營生產事業酌售民營辦法，光行招募商股半數，合力經營鹽業。頃悉該公司股本總額，暫定一千億元，分爲二十萬股，每股國幣五十萬元，一次收足。官股按規定應認十萬股，商股發起人認定一萬收，及各區產運銷商認購部份外，其餘商股公開招募，以本年九月十五日爲截止日期。股款九月三十日前，一次繳足。此項股款，分在天津錦州台灣南京上海等五處招募。該公司鹽田面積極廣，產量極豐，華北部份有鹽田二九三·五八四畝。本年度可產鹽七百萬担，估長蘆全區產鹽之半。東北部份有鹽田五〇一·八八八畝，如能全部恢復，每年可產二千萬担。本年度復舊伊始，共匪又時加破壞，產額預計二百五十萬担。，人造絲現貨充裕　賣方亟欲脫手行情低落　　人造絲昨市現貨已吿充裕，行情又見低落。上午開盤，一二〇號高山有光喊二千六百三十萬元，外埠實銷戶略有交易，迄中午收盤爲六百五十萬元賣出價，下午因鑒於絲織業照常配售，持貨者亟欲脫手，故最後價又短三十萬元，爲六百二十萬元賣出價，比上週末跌去一百萬元。　　廠絲　　呈盤旋局面，因執貨者不願廉售，實銷戶均存觀望，故成交甚稀，昨市五擔頭喊價未更，俱乏成交。Ｅ字等級喊三千一百五十萬元，比上週末稍短，然仍無做開，干經比較堅昂，喊價較上週末約大五十萬元之譜，昨日洋行貨喊價二千二百萬元，另擔二千及二千一百萬元兩檔。　　綢貨　　眞絲被面昨市因廠方拋售，以致開市即小，大誠貨開市後四十萬元成交一張，旋即下降。華强貨三十萬元成交，最小做二十六七萬元，九時後稍見回好，最大隔日期做四十二萬元，最後收市爲三十五萬元即日期，隔日期做四十萬元，大誠貨喊價有時不如華强，收市與華强相仿，格子璧縐喊價未動，但乏做開。華錦縐高檔貨二萬五千元，民生花銻二萬六千五百元有成交。　　中信局配絲三百五十箱　　中信局昨日繼續配給絲織業人造絲，爲前核定需要量十分之一，申請者共三百六十四家，共配絲三百五十餘箱，本週配價較上週爲高，計大富貴二千一百三十萬元，天橋金三馬等牌二千一百萬元。絲織協導會　第一期結束　　中央銀行爲扶持出口，爭取外匯，所領導組織絲織輸出協導委員會，本年四月耶開始推動生絲加工輸出工作。將中信局收購之生絲，交由絲織聯營公司承織。第一期原擬試辦三個月，織綢縀八萬疋，嗣以辦理頗著成績，各方均獲有好評。該會乃決定延期至八月底截止，增織三萬疋，共計十一萬疋。轉瞬八底屆滿，該會特定下月一日午後四時，舉行全體委員會議，商討第一期結束事宜。至第二期計劃，該會早已送前輪出推廣委員會核示，現輸出入管理委員會改組成立後，此項文件即轉移審議，第二期增爲二十萬疋，並擴大範圍，就江浙兩省劃爲杭州區與上海區。又該會織成之絲綢，以印度爲最大銷塲，先後運往五批，計有六萬二津青中紡資產　估價即將覆核　　〔本報訊〕中紡資產估價委員會，爲覆核靑島天津兩地中紡各廠之資產估價，將於九月初旬派專家八人，會同中紡人員，前往辦理一切，預計需時一個月以上，如環境許可時，並將赴東北一行。按中紡工廠之在靑島者，共有十三單位，在天津者共有九單位，在東北者亦有五單位，惟因局勢動盪，資產之近情不明。派往之覆核人員，尙未完全決定，已確定者爲何達蔡谷夫李學端尤懋銓、此外尙有陳師經（德孚洋行淸理處長）吳宗杰（海同毛紡廠長）兩人則已在津等待。</h3>

<p>春秋的里雅斯德的喜劇  趙景深　　丑角穿着各色的衣服，又沒有時問性，帶着吉他和胡琴，到處漫遊，正是意大利　家最愛　的題材。這些丑角都是流浪者，現在還在各地漂泊着，誰也不知道他們將到什麼地方去。　　這裏所要敍述的是的里雅斯德（Triesie）的喜劇。的里雅斯德是意大利海口的一座城，在威尼斯東北七十三里。舊城建在陵陡的山嚴現在的城則在海邊邊喜劇界中最重要的領袖人物是席奇林（Ceccheiln），他在電線舞台（Filoranmetico）演出。　　該舞合顯然是沒有窗子，觀衆跑進去感到異乎零常的熱，空氣　是淡巴菰的烟霧。這舞台居然開了十七年，嘲笑那些自誇和權威。首創的年月是一九二九年八月。第一個劇本是李吉沙（Leghissa）的「商業街市」(La　Strada　del　Commericis）。李吉沙也是該舞台的演員。席廳林即以賞此劇成名，一躍而爲首席明星。可惜所演的戲都太簡短。席奇林在無感覺的觀衆前演了一個半月，也許要另尋他的道路、好在他有有　爾弗來爾（Woelfier）做後台，認爲他是值得　育的。　　他僧惡獨裁是堅固而且難於隱藏的，因此曾受過一百八十七次警吿，又受過監視，被捕過三次。他的演出亦被罰過停演：第一次四十天，第二次七個月第三次廿二個月　　他每次到舞台，觀衆等待管他。他的幽默能迎合意大利人的心理，意大利人是懶散的，貪舒服的，愉快的。他信仰「任何人」（Uomoqualumque）主義，對於別人極昔忙。時當有不相干的人來敲他寢室的門。他彼起睡衣，開門待客，客人說了一套訴苦的話，說起他受到國家主義的迫害。自然，他本了錢走了。一連串這樣的人，每一個人都說得比前一個人更動聽。他爲了好善，用許多錢；錢用完了就送衣服。等到他錢和衣服都已送完，他穿襟進了監獄，也就沒有客人到監獄裏去有忘他了。　　最表現磨奇林個性的就是劇中與朋友在街上　談時候。他利用丑角的便利談勢政治，和國外的事情。邊地  任微音　　這是一座貧窮的小城，它有一條非常平坦光滑串通東北的街，但這是歷史的遺物了，那是屬於這城市悠長的歲月中一個極短的階段的。現在，這小城裏只剩下一排排腐舊了房屋，展覽着風雨剝削的陳蹟，那黑矮殘破的房屋下，有一對對死魚般的眼睛總隨時在偸窺着什麽，想在這一無所有的空間發現什麽出來。兩邊光頽頽的高山，披着荒草的蓑衣，也像這城裏的人民一樣，在風沙襄作邃古的瞭望，但這黄土下埋滿了碱質，那天然的鹽泉早已枯竭了，往時的繁榮的夢都在時日中間演去，正如同這光秃的高山要風化去一樣，這裏的一切都沉靜，遲呆而死寂。　　兩條錯歧的路勞圍牆上伸出綠蔭，裏面也住着人家，曲徑小橋越過流水，有離樑畫欄殘落在兩廂，橋下的滯水已經汚吳，只是春天還有白色的複辦桃花在雜叢裏偸露一些秀色，象徵已往的盛世。一個憑弔者眼裏，那是多麽的冷森可怕，連正眼也不敢看看了。　　街上成天是靜悄悄的，門是每一家都開着，褪了色的商品，總仍是爲每一個舖子裝撐門面，這似乎只是爲了習慣。走過幾家店面總有一家茶舖，濃痰佈滿在地下以及舖前的一個國半徑，茶客們稀落的坐着。一個龍鍾的老人沉坐在簷前桐樹下，神往到皇帝出巡的幻境裏去了，粗辣的烟草氣息散佈到空氣裏，老遠的有女人的聲音在喚鷄，街上突起一陣騷動，東門裏來了一乘滑杆，後面跟着兩個背長槍的大兵，那一臉烟氣的軍官，死洋活氣的從滑杆上下來，打了一個呵欠，一轉身進入高2客棧去了，兩個兵從滑杆上解下一隻箱子，搬運到屋裏去，兩間偸看的人都竊竊私議；知道這是價値連城的東西。　　這街上也有不開的舖面，有一兩家的門是經常的關着，不時有黄制服的或者是長衫　的人們出入，那裏面常常引起爭吵。有一兩次，散步到這裏看見兩個女人走進去，從印花布的下面，可看出她們都還年靑，那用紅紙染的嘴唇，那豐滿的　體，在這死潭裏，也會是一堆火，也會燒去什麽，我知道她們是幹什麽的，但我也知道不久之後一種桿狀的或者是球狀的細菌，便將腐蝕這一切，靑春，在這種買賣上，是停留得非常短暫的。　　這城市的四週也有不少產品，紅薯，花生，和蠶繭，若千年前這裏是一個產鹽地，但鹽源不足，又需要人工的燃料，鹽井現在已停爐了，蠶絲因爲市塲滯銷，多年的桑樹都被伐當了柴燒，剩下這裏的人民，天天在吃紅薯，殷富的人家是一半薯一半米，困難的家庭，便是一大鍋水，一些少得可憐的紅薯沙了。這土地生長的不够這地上人吃飽，人，是一種先天的消費動物，這城市便這樣循環性的貧窮下去。　　春耕時節，一個聰明的紳士，爲了要把城北的市築吸引到城東來，造了一個謠言，說是菩薩在東山的石壁上顯了聖，這次塲期，善男信女都集中到東城來了，不到一年，這貧瘠的土地上，竟修起一座輝煌的大廟來，縣參議會也熱烈的參加設計和監工，城北不甘示弱，於是也有一個孝子用石壁下的溝水把母親的眼疾醫好了，自然，城北的菩薩有靈也必須建廟享祭，待善男信女募成了一大筆捐款後，縣參議會，因此重價出賣了一塊公達，並且議決，將售價所得，作爲參議員們的車馬費和辦公津貼。　　最熱鬧的時侯，當然是塲期；逢塲的日子，夭一放亮，冬式的活動準備便也開始，最緊張强的是高利貸者和斗秤各稅的稽徵人員，飯館裏準備了五六倍的菜餚這是個食物的國家，胼手胝足的遠來者，在賣出了一籮花生或者是蠶繭之後也總不吝嗇化千兒八百飽餐一頓的，雖然；抹抹嘴上的油也許就繼來了心上的沉重，但這在哀哀小民，也視爲當然的了。塲上從早到晚都擠滿了人一在各式的土產之外，也可以找到比較新奇的東西，西北亞毛綫織品，由一些北方佬拿着也可以吸引一大堆人，走方郞中，牙牌算命，噴着口沫信口雌黄，一個皮鞋　被許多鄕人包圍，不捨的摸摸弄弄又走開了。酒喝得臉紅的「大爺」們，粗着勃子，到處高聲講話，耀武揚威，街上一直是這樣熙２攘攘，川流不停………一直到到天晚，一切才又靜下來。　　時間是無情的，使不少人奮起來追，或者跑！但不覺中死亡多的人和物、在不知不覺中死亡下去。從猿猴的故事說到人類，也許是非常離奇的，但是有不少的地方，有不少的人，在從人的故事開始倒退到猿猴，却沒有人知覺了，難道荒老的竟是任其荒老嗎？那小小的城市彷彿叧一世界，想起那一對對死魚般的眼睛，在我心井中總浮上個痛苦的記憶。錄蘭花  戴悟匹喬爾　　　司匹喬爾（Jean　Deapujols）曾在多種形式的繪畫中兜過圈子，結果終於　脫了一切定型，自己創出了一新路。否定了過去所有畫派的理論，提出「恢復古典」的口號。於是批評家們就稱他爲新古典主義者。作風端麗新穎，而帶裝飾趣味。在標新立的的巴黎　壇中。他軍是雅俗共賞難能可貴的一位。（劉獅）莫泊桑裝死躲債  瘦鵑　　紫羅阿桂盫雜碎　　凡是文人，似乎照例要窮的，所以賢如一代文宗韓昌黎先生，還不免有送窮文之作，眞够可濟！大概百無一用是書生，就活該和窮鬼結不解緣吧？可是文人之窮，不但我們中國如此，就是西方也在所不免，法名小說家莫泊桑（G.de　Maupassant）即其一例。莫氏曾作短篇小說好幾百篇，全都文情並茂，鞭辟入裏，因此有「短篇小說之王」的尊稱。但他小說雖做得好，却是窮得很，在巴黎時，和一個畫師合租了一間小樓住着，只爲一樣是窮極無聊，因此意氣相投，彼此很合得上來；莫氏寫了小說，就由他作插畫，供給報章雜誌，換一些稿費來，維持兩下裏的生活。那時莫氏積欠拉丁街一位文具商一筆錢，老是還不出，約定了日期，屢次失信，那文具商原是個吝嗇成性而有猶太作風的老頭兒，曾經一次次的趕上門來索債，莫氏不但沒錢還他，還要貧嘴　舌的嘲弄一番，使那老頭兒憤恨得甚麽似的，往往破口痛駡而去。有一天老文具商又氣噓噓地趕來坐索，逼迫着莫氏非還不可，不然的話，就得搬他的傢具去拍賣作抵。那畫師即忙從中調停，連連說好話，央求着寬限一天，說等他去向一位雕刻師借了錢來就如數淸償，決不食言。老頭兒總算特別通融，搭訕着走了。第二天淸早，畫師出外去借錢，莫氏躺在牀上閱讀滑稽報，借此解悶，驀聽得一陣子脚步聲，在樓梯上響着，莫氏大吃一驚，原來這脚步聲他是聽慣了的，分明是他的債主老文具商啊！這時　師還去得不久，又不知道錢借得到借不到，爲了避免麻煩起見，心中陡生一計，立刻從牀上跳起來，取了紙筆急急的寫道。「莫泊桑先生已於十六日害急病死了，所有一切未了的債務，請和白朗先生接洽淸理。」下面寫了個虛僞的地址，就是白朗先生也是子虛烏有的。當下他把這一張紙黏在門外，忙不迭的回到牀上，直僵僵地躺了下來，裝作死人的模樣；一會兒聽得老文具商已登樓入室，像河馬般不住的喘着氣；一會兒又聽得他懊恨地咒駡着，拖着迂緩的脚步踅出去了。莫氏如釋重負，吐了一口氣，驀又聽得一個嬌滴滴的聲音，喊着開門，分明是鄰家的瑪麗小姐，正是他平日所刻骨傾心的；於是一翻身跳下牀來，開門相接，兩下調笑了一會，瑪麗便興辭而去。過了幾分鐘，樓梯上又起了細碎的脚步聲，活像是瑪麗，大槪她因爲捨不得自己，去而復返了。他好生歡喜，一聽得門上剝啄之聲，立時開門歡迎。誰知站在門外的，並不是如花如玉的瑪麗小姐，却是那面目可憎的老文具商；原來他料知莫氏的急病身死是緩兵之計，所以重又趕回來，脫去了皮靴匪足上樓，所以莫氏錯認作瑪麗了。他再也沒法打發掉老頭兒，只得苦盼着畫師回來；這天終於把那筆借來的錢還淸了債，渡過難關。一寸山河一寸自  葉勁風　　咱有兩件公事得計議一下：第一咱們這一隊，由北平總一隊長規定下的名義，呌作別動隊；連情報帶游擊，咱都得幹。咱們這就算第一支隊，正副隊長大槪有個少尉階級；其餘弟兄都是上中下士，名單一上去，就有公事下來，咱們可以不必着急　　「要緊的一條，您看咱這一羣該怎麽上路？——原來只打算十幾二十人——火車的話，就算咱們寨子有辦法，可是數目太大，四五十人，最多只能走到錦州，再朝南怕就過不去了。……您看？」耀羣給了老龍第一個行動課題。　　「回大隊長話，」老龍對耀羣改了稱呼了：「您見多識廣，只要您下命令，咱弟兄們怎麽定都行……，就說人多，咱們可以分開四五撥子，對付着走……要不，「八伯過海，各顯神通」，咱們大家各走各的……您大隊長看？　　「各走各的不或。」耀羣把老龍條陳給碰回去了，「這倒是一　扎手問題不是？……讓我仔細斟酌一下，再同五爺商量一會……　　「大隊長」老龍看見耀羣作難，正在沉吟，又上倏陳了：「要不，您照原樣，跟大隊副首先起身。您只指定一個地點，限定一個日期，怎麽個走法，您不用煩心，都有咱弟兄們設法。……您看？」　　「地點是張北或張家口，日期那得先看走哪條路，能快更好，咱們可沒法兒飛…」耀說到這個「飛』字，猛然眼請一亮，似乎有了辦法似的；「我看，咱們隊子一齊走，容易打眼；分散了，又怕照顧不到。倒是有一個走法，只辛苦些，－您跟武二爺帶領他們弟兄，照平日掘　隊子打扮，先乘車到錦縣，再改車到凌源，那兒有長途汽車，先到承德，再看情形…　　「行，大隊長，旁的咱們辦不了，走道兒咱們可行。您放心得哪」！老龍說到這裏略一沉吟；「可是各人的隨身。「傢伙」：」？　　「不必帶，帶也過不去，白扔了可惜」。耀羣說得很果決；「到了地點，我有　辦法。」　　「好…」老龍鬆了一口氣似的：「恁麽說，您請萬安，一切您不用操心，咱這一大隊，準定五個日子到七偶日子，準到地點，—就說決定張北吧！」老龍好像很有把握似的。　　耀羣聽了老龍的話，雖拿不準他葫蘆裏賣的什麽藥，但一回想到）他素日的機變和信用，便爽爽快快地接受了他的請求：　　「可是今晚我就得跟虎弟動身了。其餘一切，都得蔴煩您哪。要是不發生特別意外，出月七八號我準完　到張北…暗號符記，仍舊用這兒現用的幾種。沿路盤總吃嚼方面，已經跟五爺商議定了，您打算得寬一點，開一張數目單子給五　就成，咱們寗可寬打窄用…」詩語錄  宋賢　　詩是思想的音樂，從語言的音樂中傳給我們。—　　Cha　tifed　　詩是最快樂最優良的心地中最優良最快樂時的紀錄。——Sleney　　畫是無聲的詩，而詩、是一種能說的畫。　　－Simonides自由談赤色間  Thomas　M.Johnson作　王起節譯　　世界最大的間諜綱在美國展布着，那便是蘇聯的間諜”他們出種種方法竊取軍政消息，科學發明，以及其他只要對俄國有利的事。　　美國也被迫採用反間諜的組織。最近有三名竟被俄人謀殺。俄國間諜在美國多由美國共產黨和旅美的俄國支配國—如捷·匈·奧·南·保等·僑民援助；當大戰正在進行之際，俄國已用意組議成偵探機構，他派遣了冬議工業及眾事使節團赴美，差不多有三千三百名的樣子，其中包括了很多專家，他們假裝，下級人員，以爲掩飾，到處參觀工廠，試騐所及基地等。一面竊取原子彈的秘密，一面議我們不該對原子彈保持秘密。　　每一間諜都受過高度訓練，有海陸空軍，工業，及外交的常識。有名的NKVD。（俄特工）－現已改名MRVD在美國展開其組織，到處都有他的細胞。戰時，此種單位在加拿大約十處，在美國，恐不下五十處。底特筆，支加哥，落杉機，紐約，每處均有一個以上，華盛頓可能有十個。　　本年三月統計，俄國在美工作人員爲三六九六名，另有一四三名在聯合國工作。而美在蘇代表僅二一〇各。　　間諜的頭子是常常換的，一者爲混淆外人耳目，二者爲使多數間諜都有機一會明白美國情形。有的是具有蘇俄代表的資格，有的則造了假護照，用假名字。有的人甚至是俄政府從德國囚犯中　出強强迫他們來充間諜的，這些人都會說好幾國的語言，又曾在美國住過，故而被他們言中。　　這種工作在共（產黨中是由：C.L.　Reps"（Communist　International　Rcpresentatives）之略）指導的。其中有各種族的陰謀家，用種種化名，傳們的片紙隻字，美國共產　都奉之如聖旨據　，每一正式間諜，至少有十個人隨着他工作，如正規軍異游做，專等有要一務時出差，他們遠在政府中充官吏都常用假名字。　　正規間諜網之外，還有執行特殊使命的，例如暗殺，拐騙等，他們　頭子是蘇聨內務部長貝爾利　，Beria政治局的委員之一，經常和史達棒林保持着個人接觸，，可以　獨與史氏會見。　　在美國尙有許多最案未破獲，大約全是這些問題們　的。如墨西哥城的托洛斯基被殺案，（托氏自與史達反反目，即隱居於此）美國共產黨要人博愛滋，Poyntz在紐約旅館失蹤案；紐約反共記者特里斯加Teasca被謀殺案；克斯伏特斯基Krivisky自殺案等，雨也雨不盡！　　最近問謀們活動的止標是　取原探潛入紐約，美國的反間諜機關FBI已在紐約旅館中發規他們盜取的原子彈文件，這些間諜一溜烟跑了-原子彈以外，還有B36型飛行堡壘的秘密，也是他們的目標之一，這種飛機據說可以携帶原十彈飛往世界任何地點，還有北極作戰計劃，擴大巴拿馬運河計劃等，都有人窺伺，聽說已有一人潛入維基尼亞試騐所，後因證件不符而被發現。　　在莫斯科的英美使館常被他們刺探，美大使館發密電的檯子旁，隔牆便發現了俄國的無綫電偸聽機機關，英國大使館中曾發現六具最新穎的麥克風，所幸均未洩露什麽秘密。美駐俄及其附屬國家的使領，電話常被偸聽，這些附屬國的人們仗着與美國有條約關係，常在美國各地旅行，問接於助諜報，近頃波蘭派了一組廿一名的使節團入美，商量救濟波蘭災荒，我們盛加招待，不料這些人到處窺探，把許多軍事和工業秘密供給俄國，眞是豈有此理。還有作生意的，也常常是間諜的化身，如安特爾哥商業十公司Amotorg　Trade　Corporation曾發行一種商業指南，詳載美國的交通道路，橋樑險要，工廠礦山，並附有照片，很可能是未來作戰轟炸的指引。美國專賣局對於專賣的發明是守着饒有古風的法律的，只消花上二毛五分大洋，就可以買到一條發明的解說，俄國人專門從這裏買新聞消息。　　馬歇爾登台後，爲了防止走漏，曾對國務院的職員加以淸除，有的免職，有的被起訴，每一使館領館並派去專家一名，　資防備。反間　的組織也擴大了。但美國海員之中，共黨甚多，他們常把俄國人帶進來，作秘密調査，吃虧不小。總之，美國的民主式法律，根本沒有預防他們的條文，所以近來有很多人主張要修改法律了。速標謠  蒼亢石　　何來謠談風問？　　挖根拍花信奸氛；　　可憐無知愚民輩，　　底事自擾亂紛紛！　　最近在近郊一帶，及勞働界局圍，謠諑紛紜。詞有「拍花黨」「挖眼黨」出現，因之杯弓蛇影，儀成幾件命案，而日前又發生之處因毆打「挖眼黨」而秩序大亂。（見廿八日本報）（上）旅美什錦  徐　　猶太鑽石商在美國（上）　　凡是吃過猶太人的虧的人，聽到惡唐希特勒　殺猶太人，一方面是人類天性，感到希魔的凶殘，猶太人遭遇悲憫，一方面也感到是一種不可免的刦難，猶太人在做生言方而也凶殘的相當可以，世界各國的珠寳業，　一錶業，銀行業，進出口業，大權都操在猶太人手中，這不是過甚其詞的說，所以我祗說大權操仕猶太人手中，小　遠是其他各國人所有，美國的鑽石珠寳業完全是猶太人的禁臠，即使眞正美國人想插足其間，也發不了財，因爲爲石的價格，很難定定也精確的標準，出入簡直太大了。有光彩的不同，火油光，藍光，白光，帶黄色；有分量的不同，，有磨琢的不同，平板面，多角面；有鐵製的不同，一粒鑽，五粒鑽，七粒鑽，九粒鑽，甚至於由一百多粒小鑽製成戒子，以至一千多粒小　　成的手錶鍊，把價格抬高一二萬塊美金，誰都不能說他是抬高物價，雷厲風行如美國物價統制局OPA對於鑽石的價格，可說是毫無辦法，自有一般太太小姐被敲竹槓，　＃自　得意，　中國云的達官貴人，官　旣富·不免要　幾只三克拉的鑽戒　遺細君（可作小風解），我旣不在入達官貴人之列，自然不夠資格買三克拉的鑽戒，但曾經替同學少年膻內親友的在猶太人手中化極低的代價『更極好的貨色，有幾條門徑不妨給讀者參攷；　　第一，便宜鑽戒祗有在當舖Fawnstop買得到，因爲美國習慣不作興以舊貨當新貨賣，而舊貨的價錢比新貨便宜四分之一，而且可以還價，照這價再打一個七折，結果比新貨便宜一半有餘，當舖不敢以膺品騙人，美國沒有出門不認貸的規定；我掉半個肺  裘守怡　　在十九歲那年，我乙患社血，診視生，發現有肺病，今夫三月初，病狀突吿轉劇，終日高熱不退，情勢非常危險。我的一位在上海醫學院讀書的親戚來吿訴我說，楓林橋口山醫院有肺科，設備完善，而且住院費用亦省，不妨去仔細檢査一下，於是就在四月十二那天搬進中山醫院。　　進院進院後，經過詳細檢査，醫師認爲應該使行割肺手術。因爲我患過肋膜炎支氣管炎，而且肺的傷處上下都有空洞，所以打空氣針，取肋骨等方法效力極微，因此以有割肺可以使肺和支氣管的病根驅除，並且我的身體其他各部門亦都適合割肺的條件。再經過胸腔外科黄家駟醫師的詳細復騐，還用一種氣管鏡，從喉頭插人，檢査氣管各部情形，結果決定割掉半個右肺。　　「半個肺」我當時想，「該是一樁多可怕多苦痛的事啊！」　　動手術時，完全被麻醉了，一點知覺也沒有、。手術經過僅四小時，事後醫師吿訴我，這是完成手術最順利的一次。以後雖然還經過一段危險時期，結果慢慢地好起來，在七月二十日就出院了。　　我寫這篇短文，一方面是介紹這個醫院，叧一方面也介紹爲我割肺的黄家駟醫師，他實在是個能手。頑貓了可咪（十八）　張樂平作游擊英雄吳鴻煃  夏克煜　　編者按：吳鴻　是本報　字組的工友之一·後加入蘇南游鍳隊，抗敵　國。這篇文章是現在本館新聞組工友夏克　君所寫。克到現在，吳鴻燒君的小型紀念塔還保存在新聞組排字房中，這個年靑的戰士，是値得我們深深地紀念的。　　殉難報業職工中，能實地予打擊者以打擊者，當以吳鴻煃烈士爲嚆矢。他以一個二十歲尙未滿的靑年，毅然地拋棄了職業，與敵寇作正面的殊死鬭爭！這種無我的大無畏精神，眞可以稱得上撼天地而貫日月，他能得到政府的　揚，實在是無愧於色的！　　他是本報鑄字組的工友，本報工友爲抗戰而犧牲者，得四人，而　字組竟佔二人，可謂得天獨原。他初人鑄字組爲練習生時，即以能文見　於同儕，古文造詣極深，素爲館中諸同事敬仰，而待人接物，尤利　可現。練習期滿後，夜間更入　多亞路第六中華職業補習學校補習國文，他對於學問孜孜不倦的業神，憂為校中諸同學所欽僱。後國軍西撤，「租界」情形特殊，各學校之　報，乃成為盛　敵僞之唯一工具。而第六中　職補校之壁報，口誅筆伐，更見生色；時吳君亦爲壁報）負責人之一，時常有他的文章發刋，諷刺敵僞，無微不至。因此會數度接到警吿信。但吳君並未因此氣餒，並且從此種下他參加實地工作的決心。　　嗣後吳君接得故鄕如皋來信，知道他的父親被日寇打死，當即撰一哭父文刋登於六校壁報。國仇家仇，更增張了他殺敵的決心。乃實地加入蘇南某游擊隊，肩負起抗敵工作。後即消息不通，至廿八年，輾轉始知吳君業已殉難，時年僅僅二十歲！　　吳君的殉難情形，和犧牲的時間地點，都不詳，但是他爲國犧牲，是可以肯定　　吳君殉難到現在，已經有八年了。八年，不能不說是一個悠長的日子，然而在我們這一批認識他的人中，他似乎並沒有死，他的影子。時時迴繞在我們的週圍。　　直到現在，在本館新聞組中，還有着一座袖珍的紀念碑存在着，這是新開組盛步雲君所塑造。他現得多麽莊嚴而肅穆。　　吳君是一個極度愛國愛家的人，他雖然未能見到祖國復興而喪志而歿，然而現在日寇終於給趕走了，他在天之靈總可以安息了了二！　　殉難報人的遺屬，生活多數是得困難的；吳君料想當然也不會例外，希望我們後死者，能使諸位殉難志士的英靈，不會爲了還屬的生活，而在九泉不安！</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] Wang Shijie, Foreign Minister and Chief Representative of China's Delegation to the Second United Nations General Assembly, is scheduled to fly to New York from Shanghai on a Pan American Airways jumbo jet on the 6th. He will be accompanied by Hu Yu, Director of the Treaty Department, and Zhang Changlu, Director of the Information Department. It is reported that in addition to attending the Second UN General Assembly, Wang will also make contact with key figures from various countries regarding the Korean and Japanese issues.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a reply to the U.S. Embassy in China on the morning of the 1st, expressing its agreement to the U.S. government's invitation to participate in discussions regarding the Korean issue.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 31st Consolidated Dispatch] Diplomatic officials here generally believe that the next four months will be the most important period in history concerning Far Eastern affairs. They point out that the decisions made during this period will shape the long-term trends of matters in the region. Japan, Korea, and China will all be countries of great concern during this historically turbulent period. Indonesia, Vietnam, and India will also receive equal attention. The initial discussions among the Allied nations regarding a peace treaty with Japan, "possibly to be held in September," will be the preliminary procedure for the victorious Allied nations to transform Japan's domestic future. These discussions will also reveal whether cooperation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in the Far East is still possible. If the Soviet Union insists that only the four major powers—Britain, the United States, China, and the Soviet Union—should participate in drafting the peace treaty with Japan, the other nine member states of the Far Eastern Commission will proceed with discussions regardless of the Soviet Union. These officials point out that while they are reluctant to openly break with the Soviet Union, the urgency of the current situation is such that all nations that participated in the war against Japan would rather abandon cooperation with the Soviet Union if necessary. Considering the current general views and policies of the United States, the Korean issue is expected to be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly this fall. Sources here believe that the U.S.'s abandonment of seeking an agreement with the Soviet Union on the unification of Korea and its alternative proposal to convene a four-power conference in Washington on October 8 to discuss the issue is merely another step toward the United Nations, as it is impossible for the four powers to reach an agreement when the U.S. and the Soviet Union have failed to do so. Official sources believe that the U.S.'s proposal to convene a four-power conference is just another step in its diplomatic strategy, aiming to explore all possible solutions to the Korean stalemate before submitting it to the United Nations for resolution. As for the China issue, China will receive a response regarding its request for increased U.S. economic aid within the next eight weeks. The Wedemeyer Mission is expected to return to Washington in mid-September. Well-informed sources unanimously believe that the U.S.'s China policy will be revised in October. Regarding the Indonesian issue, diplomatic figures and government officials here express considerable doubt regarding the Security Council's ability to achieve a reconciliation on the issue. Most U.S. officials believe that Indonesia's rejection of U.S. mediation was a mistake, as they not only lost the opportunity for sympathetic mediation but also caused U.S. officials to seek to strengthen the position of Western nations instead.</p>
<h3>U.S. Generals Confer in Japan on Pacific Air Force Strategy; B-50 Bombers to Appear Soon</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 1st Dispatch] The Pacific Air Force strategy conference between MacArthur and senior U.S. Air Force officers continued on the 1st. Speculation is rife that their discussions are intended to exert diplomatic pressure on U.S.-Soviet relations. General Kenney, Commander of the U.S. Strategic Air Command, arrived here on the 31st to investigate global air force facilities and immediately held a meeting with MacArthur. Lieutenant General Whitehead, Commander of the U.S. Far East Air Forces, and Lieutenant General Eaker, Commander of the Fifth Air Force, also arrived here from the Philippines and held secret talks with the other two military leaders. According to well-informed military sources, the U.S. Air Force has encountered many difficulties in its flight tests in the Pan-Arctic region, and the results have made it necessary to revise U.S. strategy while also considering other air routes connecting Europe, Asia, and the United States.</p>
<p>The increasingly tense situation in China and the conflict between the U.S. and the Soviet Union over the independence of Korea are two reasons why the U.S. is paying renewed attention to the strength of the Pacific Air Force. Observers experienced in Eastern affairs say that the U.S.'s prestige in the East depends heavily on its military strength, which must be sufficient to cope with emergencies. The U.S. Air Force has long intended to establish strategic air bases for its B-29s in Japan, the Philippines, Guam, Guadalcanal, and Okinawa.</p>
<p>Britain also plans to expand its air force facilities in Singapore, building a 19,000-foot air force runway sufficient for the largest bombers. Before arriving in the Philippines, Kenney had already held consultations with Royal Air Force leaders in London. The presence of U.S. bombers at this major airfield would enable the U.S. to spread its air power in East Asia. Once there is an emergency, these aircraft could quickly fly to Chengdu in the interior of China, where the U.S. built airfields during the war, allowing U.S. aircraft to control the heart of Central Asia. According to U.S. Air Force officials, the B-29 will soon be replaced by the B-50, a greatly improved aircraft nearly twice as heavy as the wartime heavy bomber.</p>
<p>It is reported that the U.S. Strategic Air Command is currently organizing a long-range fighter squadron, which plans to utilize the twin-fuselage Mustang P-82 with a range of 15,000 miles. This aircraft recently made a non-stop flight from Honolulu to the mainland. Air force experts say that this aircraft will become obsolete in five to seven years due to the emergence of new long-range jet bombers and fighters that are still in the testing stage. The Army Air Corps already has P-80 jet fighters stationed on various islands in the Western Pacific.</p>

<h3>Negotiations on Three-Party Nomination of Candidates Still Inconclusive</h3>
<p>Statement by Spokesperson of the Democratic Socialist Party</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Democratic Socialist Party convened a Central Standing Committee meeting yesterday from 3:00 PM after Zhang Junmai returned to Shanghai, which ended around 6:00 PM. After the meeting, the party spokesperson stated: "Regarding the negotiations for the Nanjing general election, there have been no concrete results to date. The government hopes that the three parties will submit as many candidates as possible, and then the three parties will jointly form a review committee to exchange views and conduct the review work. Therefore, the list of candidates was not discussed at today's standing committee meeting. At the same time, some members of the Standing Committee, in view of the actual situation of the recent municipal council elections in Guangzhou and Beiping, have expressed negativity towards the party's participation in the general election." Regarding the issue of vacancies for government committee members in the party, it was also discussed at yesterday's meeting, and it was decided not to nominate candidates in the short term. In the future, it may still be held by representatives from overseas.</p>

<h3>Autumn Colors Deepening in Guling; President Takes Walks in the Mountains; Visited the Library with His Wife Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guling, 1st Dispatch] The residents of Guling are encouraged and delighted by the arrival of President Chiang and his wife. After climbing the mountain on the 31st, Governor Wang Lingji of Jiangxi Province planned to prepare for a grand welcoming ceremony to be held on the 1st, requesting the President to give instructions, but the President expressed his unwillingness to be extravagant and thus the ceremony was cancelled. The celebration of the victory conference prepared by Director Wu of the Lushan Administration, which was scheduled to be held on the 3rd, will also be simplified. The President, accompanied by his wife, visited the Lushan Library, the Chuanshe School, and the Lushan Auditorium at 9:00 AM, and then returned to the official residence. In the afternoon, he and his wife took a stroll along Dalin Road from the Flower Path to the Immortal Cave, returning around 6:00 PM. When the President and his wife went out, they traveled by sedan chair. On the way back, his wife returned by sedan chair first, while the President got off the chair when he arrived at the Central School and inspected the streets on foot, inquiring about the details of the major fire this spring from Wu Shih-han, the director of the Lushan Administration, who accompanied him, before returning to the official residence to rest. The President wore a long robe and mandarin jacket today, with the duckbill cap he often wore in Guling last year. His wife wore a red velvet Western suit. The autumn colors in the mountains today are deep, and a thick fog fills the air, making it impossible to see people more than ten steps away. They did not go out in the evening, only briefly surveying the scenery from the grass, which made the mountain scenery feel particularly peaceful.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Comments on Wedemeyer's Statement: Wedemeyer Did Not Fully Understand Many Things; Some Reforms Must Await the Implementation of Constitutional Governance</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan stated in an exclusive interview with a United Press reporter on the 1st that the Chinese government would not change its domestic and foreign policies as a result of the Wedemeyer Mission's visit to China. Zhang also stated: "There are many things that General Wedemeyer did not know." During Wedemeyer's visit to China, he met with Wedemeyer many times, but Wedemeyer did not hold "important" meetings with him because Wedemeyer placed more emphasis on people outside the government than on government officials.</p>
<p>Zhang said that the reforms suggested in Wedemeyer's farewell statement had already been implemented by the government before his visit to China, but Wedemeyer believed that he was still very familiar with the situation in China soon after leaving the country. Many people wanted to meet with Special Envoy Wedemeyer but could not get the chance, so Wedemeyer did not learn about many things. Wedemeyer received a lot of help from his advisors, and perhaps Wedemeyer thought that the information was sufficient. He has a deep personal friendship with Wedemeyer and understands his good intentions, but the statement issued by Wedemeyer in his capacity as "Special Envoy of the President of the United States" has aroused much criticism among the Chinese people. He hoped that the general criticism would understand Wedemeyer's good intentions and that Wedemeyer would understand those who criticized his statement.</p>
<p>When asked, "Does Premier Zhang disagree with Wedemeyer's opinion that China must implement drastic and comprehensive political and economic reforms, as you said that China will not change its domestic and foreign policies as a result of the Wedemeyer mission's visit to China?" Zhang replied, "China has stipulated in the newly established constitution and future elections that these decisions will be implemented 'gradually'. Small matters should not be mixed with policy matters. This is a question of method. China's policy is fixed and does not intend to change its domestic or foreign policies."</p>
<p>"Our American friends say that the Chinese government is inefficient, and we are studying ways to improve it. We understand that we have learned a lot from the United States and Western countries, but implementing reforms in China will involve many things such as habits, systems, and procedures. But this does not mean that we do not intend to reform the current administration. We have many things to do now, but many things must wait."</p>
<p>"For example, we are well aware of the disadvantages of political tutelage, and we are ending it as soon as possible. But it is not appropriate to end political tutelage before the implementation of the constitution. Many similar reforms must wait until after the constitution is implemented."</p>
<p>Zhang also stated that since the government was reorganized, the government's responsibilities have become greater and the work has become more arduous, and the main task is to concentrate all efforts to guide the implementation of constitutional governance.</p>
<p>Although there are many obstacles, the government is determined to complete this task this year. Many people doubt whether the government really intends to hold the general election this autumn and believe that the general election will be postponed due to the civil war.</p>
<p>Zhang continued, "Our policy is to hold the general election, and the government will ignore all obstacles and will not change its policy."</p>
<p>Zhang also mentioned the criticism from "American friends" about the import and export regulations, which are most troubling to merchants, saying that the government feels that there has been progress in this matter, but foreign criticism cannot cause these regulations to be changed overnight.</p>
<p>Zhang concluded that the Chinese government's views on the Wedemeyer Mission had been conveyed to Wedemeyer several days before the Wedemeyer Mission left China. This can represent his personal opinions and the opinions of the Chinese government.</p>

<h3>Content of China's Draft Peace Treaty with Japan Consists of Five Major Parts and Over 120 Articles</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] China's drafting of a peace treaty with Japan has reached its final stage. Except for some outstanding issues related to reparations and other technical aspects, the draft treaty is largely complete. It will be reviewed and supplemented by the Peace Treaty with Japan Review Committee in the shortest possible time, and after discussion by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, it will be submitted to the authorities and central core meetings for final confirmation to serve as China's concrete proposals at the peace conference with Japan.</p>
<p>The initial draft of the peace treaty was completed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Peace Treaty with Japan Drafting Committee last year and has been revised twice to date. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs attaches great importance to this matter and has completed this important work with the highest efficiency and utmost thoroughness over the past two years. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has kept the content of the draft strictly confidential and refuses to publish it. However, according to the reporter's inquiries from various authoritative sources over the past month, based on the requirements of general treaties, the draft treaty is divided into five major parts, with more than 120 articles, and several appendices providing technical details on specific issues. The main points are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Preamble: Explains the significance of the treaty, which is to complete the legal end of the war, completely eliminate Japan's aggressive capabilities, and rebuild peace in the Far East and the world.</p>
<p>(2) Territorial Clauses: Generally based on the provisions of the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Agreement, and with reference to the Japanese Administrative Area Management Plan (drafted by the Allied Headquarters for the Occupation of Japan). Japan's territory will be limited to its four main islands and the surrounding small islands. The status of Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, Korea, Sakhalin Island, the Kuril Islands, the Ryukyu Islands, the Marshall Islands, and the three trust territories of Micronesia will all have specific provisions.</p>
<p>(3) Political Clauses: Japan's aggressive ideology, spirit, and political system must be completely eliminated. The content of textbooks for national education and re-education must be strictly reviewed to stop the inculcation of aggressive ideas. Social groups with militaristic spirits such as Bushido and the Black Dragon Society must be eradicated. The financial cliques that constitute the strength of aggression must be reformed and subject to control. Political reforms towards democracy must be implemented effectively.</p>
<p>(4) Reparations Clauses: The subject of Japanese reparations includes industrial production equipment and manufactured goods. The industries that it may retain are limited to civil industries that directly or indirectly cannot create aggressive forces. The living standards of the people should be given the lowest possible estimate based on the current situation. Reparations must be fully implemented. The amount of reparations that China should receive should be at least 40% or more. All public and private loans and construction assets made by Japan overseas for the purpose of aggression, such as the Nishihara Loans and the construction in the areas it once occupied, shall be unconditionally abolished or confiscated.</p>
<p>(5) Military Clauses: Japan's military equipment must be completely dismantled, and it must not retain any land, sea, or air military forces, or any directly or indirectly related military industries. Domestic order in Japan will be maintained by the police, who may only be equipped with small arms, and the import of firearms will also be limited according to specific needs. After the signing of the treaty, a control committee will be organized by the main Allied countries, and military occupation and civil supervision will continue simultaneously, for a period until the treaty is fully implemented and democracy replaces aggression. The expenses will be borne by Japan.</p>
<p>The most important of the appendices are the provisions for the implementation of the territorial clauses, the procedures for reparations and the technical provisions for the disposal of reparations goods, the provisions for the clearing of overseas assets, and the provisions for the organization and tasks of the control committee.</p>
<p>According to authoritative sources, the main principle adopted by China for the peace treaty with Japan is to eradicate all factors related to aggression while still giving its people the opportunity to live in peace and democracy. The entire draft treaty is based on this principle. China has suffered the most from Japan for the longest time and has the deepest understanding of Japan, and in the future, it will not want to suffer from it again. Therefore, the purpose of all proposals is to make Japan completely abandon aggression and strive to become a new democratic and peaceful country, re-enter the international community, and contribute to the peace of the Far East and the world to atone for its past sins.</p>
<h3>Commemorating the September 3rd Victory; Exhibition of Received Japanese Warships; National Army in Changchun Prepares for a Grand Parade</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] According to military sources, on the occasion of the second anniversary of the September 3rd Victory Day, the Naval Headquarters has decided to publicly exhibit a Japanese warship received by China through the Allied allocation at the Xiaguan Naval Dock on that day.

<h3>Communist Bandits Plunder Grain to Exchange for Military Supplies with a Certain Party</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 1st Dispatch] Since occupying eastern territories, the Communist bandits have been plundering food from the people. Recently, they established the Northeast Trading Company in Dantuqian (on the border of Xingkai Lake) in Mishan County, Heilongjiang Province, to exchange grain plundered from various places for military supplies with a certain party.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 1st Dispatch] Yang Xiufeng, "Chairman" of the Communist Bandit Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government, was ordered to strictly order all agencies to convene the masses on the 20th to initiate a voluntary donation campaign. Compatriots with even a small amount of property in the Jinnan-Taihang Bandit Area feel uneasy under their coercion. According to bandit propaganda, all the donations will be used to purchase aircraft and new weapons from a certain country to continue their policy of harming the country and people. Furthermore, it is learned that the Bandit Ji-Lu-Yu region has launched a "bloody struggle" again, and those with assets and so-called "fugitives" are not spared. Near the Nanshuiye town of Cixian County, an average of 60 people were killed in each village. In addition, the Bandit Ding County Government recently convened a mass meeting and executed more than 100 people who welcomed the National Army to vent their anger.</p>
<h3>Completion of the Heishiguan Bridge; Express Trains Added on the Luoyang-Zhengzhou Line</h3>

<h3>Nie Rongzhen's Main Bandit Forces Assembled Near Baoding</h3>

<h3>The Exchange Rate of the Japanese Yen to the U.S. Dollar Is Rumored to Be Adjusted Again Soon</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 1st Dispatch] Well-informed sources say that the exchange rate of the Japanese yen to the U.S. dollar will soon be adjusted to 130 yen per U.S. dollar. Before the outbreak of the war, the exchange rate was 4 yen to 1 U.S. dollar. When the Allied forces entered after the war, the Allied forces set the unofficial exchange rate for U.S. dollars to Japanese yen at 15 yen to 1 U.S. dollar. After the British and American occupation authorities issued military scrip to curb black market activities, the yen exchange rate was adjusted to 50 yen to 1 U.S. dollar. The Japanese Economic Newspaper magazine estimated in July this year that the true value of the yen in Tokyo should have been 148 yen to 1 U.S. dollar at that time, and the black market price was between 100 and 150 yen.</p>
<h3>Churchill Should Be Held Responsible for the Difficulties China Has Encountered in the Northeast; Strategic Blunders Created Today's Stalemate</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] Today, two years after the signing of the Yalta Agreement, some Chinese claim that Churchill should bear the greatest responsibility for the difficulties the Chinese government has encountered in the Northeast. Previously, President Roosevelt was regarded as bearing the main responsibility, but now many Chinese historians accuse Churchill of being the great culprit. The reason is that Churchill opposed opening a second front in 1943. If the second front had been opened in 1943 according to Roosevelt's plan, the Soviet Union might not have participated in the war against Japan, or even if the Soviet Union had participated, at least the price should have been lower. In the spring of 1945, Roosevelt, Stalin, and Churchill signed the Yalta Agreement, purchasing Soviet participation in the war against Japan. This agreement forced China to transfer some of Imperial Russia's privileges in China to the Soviet Union, such as joint management of the China Changchun Railway, Soviet use of Lushun Port as a naval base, and the lease of half of Dalian Port's facilities to the Soviet Union without compensation for 30 years. Chinese recall that the United States had drafted a plan to attack Europe by crossing the English Channel in 1943, and Churchill initially agreed to this plan, but suddenly suggested attacking North Africa and Italy first. Roosevelt agreed after Churchill guaranteed that he would attack Europe in 1944. Churchill's reason for attacking the Mediterranean and Balkan regions was purely a political strategy. Churchill's plan was a major strategic blunder, as Hitler only had 29 divisions in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands in 1943, while he had 58 divisions in 1944. In addition, the German Sixth Army, which Churchill feared, had been defeated by the Soviet Union in 1943. Therefore, the conclusion is that if the second front had been opened in 1943, the war could have ended a year earlier, and the loss of manpower and resources could have been reduced. The United States would also have increased its confidence, manpower, and armament in the war against Japan. In this way, the Allies would not have had to "beg" the Soviet Union to participate in the war, and China would have already recovered the entire Northeast.</p>
<h3>Henan National Army Recaptures Gushi; Communist Bandits Flee Dabie Mountains; Martial Law Begins Tonight in Wuhan</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 1st] The focus of the war is gradually shifting south to the Dabie Mountain area on the border of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei. The National Army pursuit and suppression corps recaptured Gushi at 2:00 PM on the 31st. The remnants of Liu's Third Column fled south to areas near Yejiaji and Lihuang, where the National Army is encircling and suppressing them. The National Army advancing east along the Pinghan Railway recovered Gangdian (southwest of Luoshan) on the morning of the 1st. The war situation has developed into a new stage, and the National Army is making new deployments.</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 1st] The war in southern Henan has entered a pacification stage. The National Army has entered and garrisoned Shangcheng, and is conducting mopping-up operations in the Jingfu area.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 1st] Part of Liu's Third Column, which was trapped in Gushi, was completely annihilated by the National Army's fierce counterattack. The city was recovered by the National Army at noon on August 31st. After being fiercely attacked by the National Army moving south, the Second and Sixth Columns of bandits have been on the run for several days. When they arrived at Macheng County seat in the afternoon of August 31st, they did not dare to rest for a moment due to the rapid advance of the National Army from all directions. On the morning of the 1st, they harassed Songbu, but were again severely attacked head-on by the National Army moving north, and are now fleeing southeast of Songbu in a panic. The independent column of bandits that fled to Xuanhuadian suffered heavy casualties after being intercepted by the National Army. The remnants are now being encircled and annihilated in the area north of Xuanhuadian. A part of the independent brigade of bandits that fled to Zhutangdian fled to Jiuliguan at 1:00 PM on August 31st, attempting to join its main force, but has now been cut off.</p>
<p>[Our Hefei Dispatch, 1st] Part of the communist bandits fled from Shangcheng to Lihuang on the 30th. The situation is unclear.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou Dispatch, 1st] After Liu Bocheng's communist bandit forces fled to Dabie Mountains, they could not hold their ground due to the National Army's urgent pursuit and were scattered and fleeing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou Dispatch, 1st] In order to ensure public security and prevent treacherous activities, the Wuhan Headquarters has ordered the responsible agencies to impose martial law every night from 12:00 AM to 6:00 AM, starting from the 2nd.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou Dispatch, 1st] Chen Geng's bandit army, which attempted to aid Liu Bocheng, was blocked in the outer areas of Luoyang. In the battle of Hengshui, the bandits used forces more than double that of the National Army, launching round-the-clock attacks for a week, but failed. This fact is sufficient to show that their attempt to cross south has been shattered. At the same time, even if the communist bandits could approach Luoyang and carry out a siege, it would inevitably lead to a decisive battle, and all of Chen Geng's strength would inevitably be wiped out. The precarious situation of the communist bandits in western Henan is no less dangerous than that of Liu Bocheng's fleeing and defeated forces.</p>
<p>Naval Bombardment of Longkou; Communist Bandits in Shandong Suffer Heavy Losses</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] A Xuzhou telegram states: The government navy has begun to fiercely bombard Longkou, a key port in northern Shandong controlled by the communist bandits, located 60 miles west of Yantai.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Colonel Wang, a military spokesperson for the government, stated on the 1st: "The recent victories of the National Army in Shandong have shattered half of the communist army's strength in mainland China, marking a major turning point in the civil war." He also stated: "Due to the encirclement of the New Fourth Army in the Shandong war, the communist army's Jilu line from the Northeast has been sealed off. In terms of combat effectiveness and equipment, the National Army has now achieved half success south of the Great Wall." He revealed that at the peak of their power in Shandong after the end of World War II, the communist army controlled a total of 96 counties, but now only controls 53 counties, mostly in a narrow strip in northern Shandong bordering the Yellow River. South of the Jiaoji Railway, the communist army controls only two counties.</p>

<h3>Characters Jumping on the Red Stage in Warsaw (Continued from Yesterday) Fourth Letter from Poland</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing of this Newspaper</p>
<p>Afterwards, I didn't mention this matter to the International Propaganda Department. A few days before I left, our embassy even made a phone call for me. The reply was, "Mr. Gomulka is on summer vacation and may not be able to meet with reporters from your country." I was busy with visiting factories, schools, etc., and later forgot about it.</p>
<p>Gomulka is a communist member who started as a chemical worker. He is the most loyal "comrade" of the Kremlin. Because he was often arrested and imprisoned in the past, he understands the tricks of political struggle better than others. Many Poles say he is sinister and vicious, and some compare him to the Polish Vyshinsky. A friend from the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs told me: Gomulka is definitely not a person like史林. He also said: "Now the most powerful person in the Polish Communist Party is not Gomulka, but勃耳曼, because勃耳曼 controls Poland's '武般'!" "武般" is the Polish secret service. I don't know if this organization belongs to the Communist Party or the government? As a foreign journalist behind the Iron Curtain, it is really not appropriate to get to the bottom of things. I have never met勃耳曼. No one mentioned勃耳曼's name at the garden party at the Prime Minister's residence that day.</p>
<p>In addition to these people, there is also Industrial Minister闵斯 in the red circle in Poland, a communist member with a scholarly demeanor and a very meticulous mind. Some say: 闵斯 is Jewish, and some say his ancestors had Jewish blood!</p>
<p>During the five years of Nazi conquest of Poland, the Jews suffered the most tragic sacrifices. Hitler's henchmen killed Jews, often five hundred or a thousand at a time, mowing them down with machine guns. It was truly inhuman to the extreme. Now that Hitler has been defeated, the Jews have returned to Poland and have gained considerable "important positions." Under the freedom of speech in Poland, discussing the Jewish question is often restricted. I know that a special article about Jews in the Polish Peasant Party's "洛獨瓦" daily was confiscated.</p>
<p>I don't pay much attention to this issue, but I generally know that Poland once had 5 million Jews out of a population of 32 million before the war. The history between Jews and Poland could fill a special study. Generally speaking, the Polish economy before the war was controlled by the Jews. Many "summer resort" villas near Warsaw were almost all Jewish before the war. Now they have been changed into many "托兒所", "lung disease sanatoriums" and "children's hospitals", and so on.</p>
<p>There are no exact statistics on the number of Jews in Poland now, but roughly speaking, there are no more than 500,000 out of 23 million post-war Poles. The Polish government is now trying its best to eliminate the boundaries between Jews and non-Jews, and therefore does not want to reveal the Jewish issue in public opinion. During my stay in Warsaw, I attended a reception hosted by Jewish national leader Dr.史奈克. He had just returned from Palestine and was specially responsible for diplomatic work in the Soviet Union and behind the Iron Curtain. The most important central idea of Dr.史奈克's speech for more than an hour was to overthrow the rule of the British Empire in the Middle East and Near East!</p>
<p>The refreshments served that day were very generous. In addition to foreign and Polish journalists, there were also many Polish Jews捧塲. Dr.史奈克 gave his speech in Polish. The Polish International Propaganda Department specially sent a lady to translate for me, because everyone in the audience understood Polish, except me.</p>
<p>I am always grateful to the Warsaw authorities for their kindness to me. In my next communication, I will introduce them in particular. (The End)</p>
<h3>War Criminal Prison Established in Shanghai; To Be Completed by the End of This Month</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] According to the Military News Agency: In order to execute the sentences of war criminals who have already been convicted, the Ministry of National Defense will establish a war criminal prison in Shanghai. All war criminals who have been sentenced to imprisonment nationwide will be sent to this prison to serve their sentences. It is reported that the Ministry of National Defense has ordered Director Zou Renzhi of the Second Department to prepare in Shanghai, and it may be formally established by the end of this month to accommodate war criminals awaiting execution.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Youth League Cadres and Supervisors Scheduled to Be Held in Guling; Unification of Party-State Organization to Be Completed Before May 5th Next Year</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The joint meeting of Youth League cadres and supervisors is scheduled to open on the 5th. The meeting is scheduled for three days and will be personally presided over by League Leader Chiang. Attendees will fly to Xunyang on the 4th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Regarding the implementation period of the unification of the Party-State organization, it is rumored that it will begin after the closing of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, and the Youth League will be merged into the Party immediately. Therefore, some insiders believe that the recently convened joint meeting of the Party and League will be the last meeting to handle the end of League affairs. The reporter recently visited Xiang Chan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Ministry of the Youth League, to inquire about the implementation method. It is understood that the Central Government has determined that the unification of the Party-League organization does not mean merging the Party and League, nor does it mean mixing the Party and League, but rather having League members infiltrate the Party to create new revolutionary forces. This work process will require a considerable period of time and may be completed when the Seventh National Congress of the Kuomintang is opened. The date of the Seventh National Congress of the Kuomintang is around May 5th, 1937. Therefore, the completion of the unification of the Party-League organization will be before May 5th next year.</p>
<h3>Chen Jiageng Talks to Reporters in Singapore</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent Wu Jiatang of this Newspaper, Singapore Dispatch, 1st] The local overseas Chinese leader, Mr. Chen Jiageng, told the reporter group that passed through Shanghai to Singapore: "China hopes that a third party will emerge to call on the people and rebuild peace." Mr. Chen believes that this party must be growing, but he does not know who its leader is. Mr. Chen declined to criticize Chairman Chiang, but said that a leader of a country must be able to seek welfare for the people and be supported by the people. When Mr. Chen talked about the issue of overseas Chinese unity, he said: "If the situation in the country does not change one day, the ideological conflicts of the overseas Chinese will not stop one day. If China is united, the overseas Chinese will definitely support it as a whole." Mr. Chen declined to criticize the relative strength of the overseas Chinese leftists and rightists, but he believes that 80% of the overseas Chinese support China's democratization. Mr. Chen told reporters that he has not joined any party because he "can neither lead others nor wants to be led by others." He is not interested in the election of national representatives. He believes that only a few people are interested in this matter. Mr. Chen believes that China should adopt a policy that is neither pro-American nor pro-Soviet. "A country with a vast territory and a large population like China should have an independent foreign policy and should not be afraid of any country. The conquest of the world by force has passed!" He deeply regrets that the domestic situation in China prevents it from becoming the leader of the small countries in Asia and protecting them.</p>

<h3>China and Venezuela Strengthen Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>That Country Decides to Open an Embassy in Beijing</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] It is learned from diplomatic circles that the diplomatic relations between China and Venezuela will be strengthened. The Venezuelan government has decided to open an embassy in Nanjing and has appointed Fowler, the former Consul General in Shanghai, as Venezuela's Chargé d'affaires to China. He is expected to arrive in China around mid-September. Our government will not appoint a full-time ambassador to Venezuela, but will have Minister Yu Wangde in Colombia serve concurrently. Chen Zehua, a PhD, will be appointed as the First Secretary of the concurrent embassy in Venezuela, acting as the head of the embassy. It is reported that Chen, the chargé d'affaires, will soon embark on his journey to Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, to assume his new post.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Basic Problems of Basic Education in the Far East</h3>
<p>The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Far East Basic Education Conference is scheduled to open tomorrow in our nation's capital. The conference will last ten days, with a scheduled closing on the 12th. In addition to representatives from UNESCO, participants will include representatives from over ten countries, including China, India, Siam, the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, Bhutan, Nepal, Burma, Ceylon, and Malaya. This is truly a grand gathering for the academic and cultural circles of the Far East. In addition to extending a warm welcome to the representatives of various countries as the host nation, we would like to take this opportunity to examine some of the fundamental issues of basic education in the Far East, for the reference of the representatives of all countries.</p>
<p>Basic education is not a new endeavor. Since the dawn of humanity, there has been education. Education entails cultivating literacy and various ways of life in children and adults. Our nation's Six Arts education and the West's Three Aspects of Education are educations that aim toward this path. As the spokesperson for UNESCO stated, "The term 'basic education' is used to encompass both the concepts of children's education and adult education. It indicates that this type of education not only teaches people to read, write, and calculate, but also imparts some basic knowledge so that they can make a living, improve their economic situation, express themselves, improve their hygiene environment, and participate in domestic and international political activities, thereby guiding them toward a richer and more fulfilling life."</p>
<p>Preparations for this conference have taken three months. Our nation's experts have devoted themselves to preparing a "remarkable" set of materials. According to various reports, the materials they have planned include techniques and tools for language, writing, teaching, reading, and literacy training.</p>
<p>However, in our view, the basic problem of basic education in the Far East does not lie in technique, but in attitude; not in method, but in policy. If the attitude of outsiders toward the Far East is improved, and if the policies of outsiders toward the Far East are improved, the basic education of various countries in the Far East will be resolved without further effort. Owen Lattimore once said, "Americans have several obstacles to understanding the problems they need to understand. The biggest of these is our habit of putting Europe above all considerations. If we transfer political ideas to Africa and Asia, our habit is still to think from the European perspective." We fear that the Far East Basic Education Conference will also take Europe as its starting point and Europe as its center. If this erroneous attitude is committed, the obstacles to basic education in the Far East will be numerous.</p>
<p>The participants of the Far East Basic Education Conference include fifteen countries: China, Australia, India, Indonesia, Burma, Vietnam, Korea, Malaya, New Zealand, the Philippines, Siam, Bhutan, Nepal, Afghanistan, and Ceylon. Among these fifteen countries, with the exception of three or four, most are colonies, semi-colonies, or affiliated states awaiting liberation. Westerners are accustomed to calling them the "tropical Far East," which has a close relationship with Europe in many respects. During the conference, efforts must be made to avoid viewing the Far East through the eyes of Europeans and strive to view the Far East from the perspective of the Far East itself. If the political history and economic destiny of hundreds of millions of people in this Far East over the past centuries were not determined outside the Far East circle, basic education in the Far East would definitely not have the problems it has today.</p>
<p>The Far East is full of ancient civilizations, with brilliant early human cultures. History has proven that the people of the Far East are not inferior. Before the new era, that is, before Western powers extended their reach to the Far East, education in the Far East was widespread, was education for life, was education for culture, and had social, economic, and religious value. The American Far East expert, Furnivall, said, "Before the second half of the nineteenth century, the tropical Far East had schools, and the number of literate people was greater than in Europe at the same time."</p>
<p>Western politicians want to use education to transform Eastern society, but the transformation of society is not due to education, but due to economic forces, and this new society in turn transforms the quality of education. Large groups of people cannot come into contact with Western culture. Beneath the surface, the anger of resistance to the West is universally burning. As the wheel of time steps into the present, efficiency and social justice replace liberalism. At the same time, imperialism presents the phenomenon of the end of its strength. This tendency is reflected in colonial policy. The British publication of the "White Man's Burden" doctrine includes a new political philosophy and an ethical standard. Dutch colonial politicians advocated an "ethical" policy. French colonial doctrine replaced "assimilation" with "association." The new policy has changed the attitude towards education, viewing education as the main tool for economic progress and human welfare. In the early 20th century, the main aspects of the new education policy gradually formed. Its purpose is especially to develop basic education and vocational education, and to focus on women's education and adult education. It can be seen that before this new education was implemented, nationalism had already arisen. Nationalists viewed education very differently from the government. The government viewed education as economic rather than cultural; for survival rather than for life; teaching children how to make a living, but not teaching how to live, losing the value of education? In short, the basic problem of basic education in the Far East today does not lie in methods and techniques, but in attitudes and policies. If attitudes and policies are not improved, no matter how good the methods and techniques are, they will still be constrained and unable to make progress. It is hoped that the attending representatives will look at the basic education of this Far East with a broad perspective.</p>

<h3>Handling of Company Registration Cases by the Ministry of Economic Affairs</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that if a company registration case is found to involve foreign capital, and there are share ratio restrictions in its laws, the main agency (the agency implementing the law) will be consulted for proper handling. For example, the registration of shipping companies has always been handled after consulting the opinion of the Ministry of Communications. After a company is registered, if the registered items or reported documents are found to contain false information, the registration may be revoked according to legal procedures. Foreigners who use Chinese names to invest are also subject to legal sanctions. If the Ministry discovers such cases, it will take action to ban them at any time. Although the new Company Law does not restrict the share ratio of Sino-foreign joint ventures, other laws, if any, should still be followed.</p>

<h3>United Nations Investigating Committee Recommends Partition of Palestine: Report Submitted to the UN General Assembly</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] London Broadcast, 1st: Regarding the report of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine, the British government has only received a summary. Officials decline to comment. An external spokesperson stated that British officials would not express any opinion until the report was submitted to the United Nations General Assembly, and that the authorities would remain silent at least until they had received the full report and studied it.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] The United Nations Special Committee on Palestine submitted to the United Nations General Assembly on the night of the 31st a proposal passed by a majority of the committee members, suggesting dividing Palestine into a Jewish state, an Arab state, and a special city of Jerusalem. This system will be implemented after a two-year transition period starting from July 1, 1947. During the transition period, Britain will continue to be responsible for the administration of Palestine under the auspices of the United Nations, and may be assisted by one or more member states of the United Nations. The proposal also stipulates that before the official recognition of the independence of the two countries, the two countries should sign a treaty establishing an economic alliance to ensure economic cooperation after independence. During the transition period, Britain should stipulate the same fixed amount each month, allowing 150,000 Jews to immigrate to Palestine each month. If the transition period exceeds two years, the number of Jews immigrating each year should be set at 60,000. The organization of immigration is the responsibility of the Jewish Agency. The residents of the two countries should each elect a constitutional assembly. After the constitutional assembly is established, it should appoint a provisional government. The provisional government should issue a declaration guaranteeing basic freedoms, non-discrimination against minorities, and promising to sign an economic alliance treaty. After these procedures are completed, the country will be recognized as an independent sovereign state after the treaty is signed. If only one of the two countries completes these procedures, the United Nations General Assembly should decide what action to take. Residents of Palestine will become citizens of the country in which they reside after their country is recognized as independent, but they also have the freedom to choose to live in another country if they wish.</p>
<p>The economic alliance treaty signed by the two countries should include the establishment of a customs union, a monetary exchange system based on common interests, joint transportation of railways, highways, post and telecommunications, joint use of the ports of Haifa and Jaffa, and joint development of water conservancy and land projects. The organization that manages this economic alliance is a joint economic committee composed of three representatives from each of the two countries, together with three foreign members appointed by the United Nations Economic and Social Council. During the transition period of Jerusalem, it will be placed under international trusteeship, with the United Nations organization as the governing authority. Its area includes the existing urban area and nearby towns and villages. The three members of the United Nations Special Committee, India, Iran, and Yugoslavia, support the establishment of a federal independent state with Jerusalem as its capital. The Australian representative abstained from voting on both systems.</p>
<p>Under the partition system, the land of the Jewish state should include the eastern part of Galilee, the Esdraelon Plain, most of the coastal plain, and the entire Beersheba area, including the Negev. The Arab state will include the western part of Galilee, Samaria and Judea, and the plain south along the Egyptian border.</p>
<h3>Arab Nations Oppose Partition: Express Willingness to Use Force</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 1st] Palestinian Arabs feel extremely shocked that the United Nations Committee's proposal includes Haifa, Palestine's largest port, within the territory of the Jewish state. The Hussein Party's newspaper stated that the Arab nation is determined to reject the partition plan and will use force if necessary. Haifa has belonged to the Arabs for 1,300 years and will never be abandoned. Jewish and Arab people here are searching for maps to see the borders of the two countries according to the recommendations of the United Nations Committee. Jamal Husseini, vice chairman of the Arab Higher Committee, telegraphed Arab newspapers here from Cairo, stating that the Arabs will not agree to the committee's report or any partition proposal, and that the Arab nation is determined to continue the struggle. Jewish Agency executives are still in Switzerland and have not been able to express their views on the plan. Non-official Jews generally welcome this partition plan.</p>

<h3>Soviet Occupation Zone in Germany Dismantles Coal Mining Equipment</h3>

<h3>Revolution Erupts Again in Ecuador in Opposition to the New Government of Menchina: American Countries May Intervene</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Guayaquil, Ecuador, 31st] After Colonel Menchina launched a revolution last week, overthrowing the government of President Ibarra and establishing his own government, military revolutions against the Menchina government broke out today in the cities of Riobamba and Guaranda. Menchina has sent troops from the capital, Quito, to suppress the revolutionary army in Riobamba, 150 kilometers north of the capital.</p>
<h3>Government Gazette States: Other parts of the country are stable. Guayaquil, Ecuador's second largest city and the country's main port, is not experiencing unrest. People here believe that conservative elements support the revolutionary movement, as the conservatives oppose the Menchina government and believe that, constitutionally, Vice President Velasco should succeed Ibarra as president.</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Quito, Ecuador, 1st] There is much speculation among the public regarding what impact the formal signing of the Inter-American Mutual Defense Treaty in the capital of Brazil tomorrow will have on the political situation in Ecuador. On August 24, Ecuador was excluded from the signatory countries of the treaty due to a coup launched by Minister of National Defense Menchina, which overthrew the president. However, the treaty stipulates that if the actions and situation of any country in the Western Hemisphere endanger peace in the Americas, or if the "political independence" of any country is threatened, the foreign ministers of the countries should consult and decide to take collective steps to deal with it. Therefore, the current situation may provoke intervention from various countries.</p>

<h3>US Legion Demands Congress To Declare Communist Party Illegal</h3>
<p>[United Press International, New York, July 31st] The 29th annual convention of the American Legion, lasting four days, concluded on the 31st. The convention unanimously passed a resolution emphasizing that Communism is the greatest threat to the United States. The association requested that Congress convene a special session to pass universal military training and other national defense-related legislation and demanded that Congress declare the Communist Party illegal. The association's foreign affairs paper also passed a resolution asserting that the dictatorial rulers controlling the Soviet Union are plotting to create economic crises within the United States and abroad.

One of the Republican leaders, Stetson, delivered a temporary speech praising the resolution of the foreign affairs platform and calling on the convention to support the Marshall Plan.

<h3>Four-Power Conference on Korea Unlikely to Achieve Success</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, July 31st, United Press International] The "Sunday Star" editorial stated: "The only policy that the United States can currently adopt toward Korea is to establish a Korean government in the US-controlled area of South Korea and strengthen its position with various assistance beneficial to the reconstruction of the area." The newspaper continued: "The United States' proposal to hold a four-power conference on the Korean issue here on September 8th has as slim a chance of reaching an agreement as the US-Soviet Joint Commission conducting negotiations in Korea. However, this four-power conference, by demonstrating the Soviet Union's evasiveness and bad faith regarding Korean matters, will enable the United States to pursue its own unilateral policy in South Korea with greater moral and diplomatic backing."</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, July 31st] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt's attitude greatly changed after meeting with MacArthur. British Commonwealth representative to the Allied Council for Japan, Bower, was recalled to Australia. However, Evatt's new "leniency policy" has sparked fierce opposition and has now been largely abandoned. From the perspective of the Canberra Conference's stance on the Japanese peace treaty, friction may arise between the United Kingdom and the United States over MacArthur's proposed economic and industrial level for Japan at the preliminary peace treaty conference in Washington. This level is based on the average conditions during the normal peaceful period of 1930 to 1934 and will enable Japan to maintain a standard of living far superior to other Asian countries.</p>
<h3>Greek Parliament to Open on Thursday, New Government Faces Test, New Prime Minister Declares Resolution Never to Yield to Guerrillas</h3>

<h3>City Government Convenes Meeting to Save Industrial Production, New Electricity Conservation Measures to Be Strictly Implemented Starting Next Month, Six Methods for Factories to Generate Electricity Themselves Approved</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] This city's electricity conservation discussion meeting was held at 4:30 p.m. yesterday in the city government auditorium, chaired by Mayor Wu. Representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau, Police Bureau, Public Utilities Bureau, City Council, City Chamber of Commerce, Industrial Association Shanghai Branch, Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, China Textile Construction Company, 6th District Textile Association, and various electric power companies, totaling more than 20 people, attended. After the meeting, Mayor Wu received reporters and solemnly reported the severity of the city's electricity shortage, stating that the electricity consumption of shops and households in the city has exceeded more than double that before the war, while the electricity consumption of factories has decreased compared to before the war. The city government has decided to correct this unreasonable phenomenon. In addition to ordering factories with power generation equipment to generate electricity from now on, electricity consumption by shops and households will be strictly limited. The methods have been instructed by the Public Utilities Bureau and submitted to the City Government for approval by the City Council, and will be implemented from October 1st. According to Mayor Wu, this year's electricity restriction measures will be stricter than last year because the city government is determined to save the city's industrial sector. Otherwise, after production is hit, it is inevitable that a wave of price increases will be triggered. Therefore, electricity conservation is closely related to the skin of the citizens, and we hope to implement it effectively.</p>
<h3>Incentives for Self-Generation of Electricity</h3>
<p>The following methods for factories in Shanghai to generate electricity with their own power generation equipment were approved yesterday: (1) In order to cooperate with the General Mobilization Ordinance and alleviate the city's electricity shortage, all factories in the city with their own generators of 100 kilowatts or more should generate electricity themselves within a limited time. Those that have already been purchased and arrived in the city but have not been installed should be transferred to factories willing to purchase them so that they can generate electricity. (2) The amount of electricity generated by the power generation equipment of each factory, in addition to the original factory retaining 50% for its own use, the remainder will be allocated by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau. (3) The fuel used for the power generation equipment of each factory will be allocated by the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs at the price of coal for public utilities after the quantity is verified by the Public Utilities Bureau, or the city government will negotiate with the Central Bank to separately allocate fuel according to these methods from September 1st. (4) All power generation costs, if the cost exceeds the general electricity tariff price, the excess part will be subsidized by the municipal government by drawing funds from the electricity tariff price when setting the tariff price to provide incentives. (5) If any factory delays power generation for any reason, the Public Utilities Bureau may notify the power company to reduce the original power supply to the factory. (6) Once the city's electricity shortage is resolved, the above principles will be cancelled.</p>

<p>Bao Chang Fa Kee Jewelry Store at 331 Central Middle Road sued Zhong Yuxiu of Bao Chang Jewelry Store at 308 Tongfu Road for defamation. The case was tried by Judge Lian at the District Court yesterday. According to the attorney representing the plaintiff, the defendant published a false accusation claiming that the plaintiff was infringing on the brand name for five consecutive months. Among them, there was a drawing of a woman raising the defendant's Bao Chang big sign with both hands, and the woman was stepping on multiple small signs with her feet, including Bao Chang and Bao Chang, etc., acknowledging that the plaintiff's Bao Chang was associated with male thieves and female prostitutes. Furthermore, a gold ingot was pointing directly at the woman's crotch. The images and text were obscene, intentionally vicious, and exhausted all possible means of defamation and damage to the plaintiff's business reputation. The defendant also hired a lawyer to defend. The court considered the criminal suspicion to be great and ordered a written property guarantee of 200 million yuan for the summons. The court also criticized the defendant for being a proper businessman and should not engage in such behavior, and the parties were asked to negotiate a settlement out of court during the adjournment.</p>
<h3>Three Catastrophes in Sichuan Province, Xu Kan Reports on Disaster Situation</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] National Government Comptroller Xu Kan received reporters at the Youth Association yesterday, reported on the disaster situation in Sichuan Province, and appealed to all circles for relief. The general idea was: "Sichuan Province has suffered heavy rains in the southeast, northwest, and throughout the province since late June. From July 1st to 5th, there was torrential rain, mountain torrents broke out, and the water level on the plains rose to between 1 and 2 zhang, turning into the Minjiang, Tuojiang, and Fujiang River basins, as well as the upper reaches of the Yangtze River basin. Houses, livestock, farmland, and property in the counties along the river were all washed away. Many residents were killed or injured. Among them, Chengdu City, located between the Minjiang and Tuojiang Rivers, had eight tenths of the city (including more than 60 streets) submerged. The water level was up to the production pipeline in low-lying areas, and the water depth was 4 or 5 feet in high-lying areas. Outside the city was a vast expanse of water. The factories (because water intake is all along the river), warehouses, docks, sugar warehouses, and coal, firewood, oil, and rice warehouses along the Fu River were all washed away. This was the first catastrophe of the year. From July 30th to August 3rd, there was another heavy rain disaster. Counties such as Mabian and Muchuan suffered heavy disasters, which was the second catastrophe. From August 12th to 14th, torrential rain poured down, causing floods in the Fujiang, Tuo, and Min Rivers. Dozens of counties, including Guanxian, Chengdu, Huayang, Mianyang, Xinjin, and Ebian, suffered a third catastrophe. In terms of existing property losses, Chengdu City suffered the most. In the other 50 or so disaster-stricken counties, the loss of agricultural crops (rice) was the greatest. Not only were the crops washed away, but even fertile farmland was washed into stony fields and sand mines. This year's autumn harvest is naturally hopeless. Even in the next two or three years, it will be difficult to cultivate these stony fields and sand mines. (2) According to the Sichuan Provincial Government's disaster survey report, a total of 46 counties and cities were affected, with losses of more than 700,000 mu of farmland and more than 6,300 houses. More than 489,400 residents were affected, and property losses were estimated at over 100 billion yuan. More than 6,000 people died, and disaster surveys are still being conducted in nine counties, and the losses should not be small. The three catastrophes were truly unspeakable. (3) The current number of disaster-stricken people is at least 600,000. They are destitute, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. Their livelihood for the next year and their current medical needs depend on relief from all parties. How can nearly one million mu of fertile farmland that have been washed into stony fields and sand mines be restored to cultivation? How can factories that have been destroyed be restored to operation? How can dikes and bridges be rebuilt? It is even more necessary for the press to appeal to all parties to provide strong assistance so that the people of our anti-Japanese base area can jointly complete the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the country."</p>
<p>After the speech, he distributed the "Statistical Table of Flood Losses in Various Counties of Sichuan Province in the 36th Year," listing the figures in great detail. Liu Hangchen stated: "The number of losses has been calculated by the provincial government after repeated investigations and guarantees that it is accurate."</p>

<p>Signed, Reader Question</p>
<p>This newspaper also received a letter yesterday from a gentleman from the Commodity Tax Bureau, inquiring whether this newspaper has a provision for "lending money for tuition, to be repaid in three months." The original letter and the reply from the Reader Scholarship Fund Committee of this newspaper are recorded below:</p>
<p>"To the esteemed editor: I recently learned that your newspaper is organizing a reader scholarship fund to help youths out of school, benefiting society. Since my return after the war, I have been working at the Shanghai Commodity Tax Bureau, fg.</p>
<p>In recent years, the life of civil servants has been unspeakably difficult. I have five children. My eldest daughter graduated from high school but cannot afford to go to college. My eldest son is studying at the Shanghai Law College High School, my second son is studying at the Su Min Middle School, and my third and fourth sons are studying at the Su Min Elementary School. Tuition fees have increased several times this semester. My monthly income is only 57 yuan, plus a rice subsidy of over 200,000, which is barely enough to feed the family. How can I afford these huge tuition fees? I have long admired your newspaper for serving the welfare of society, and I am writing to request that you allow me to borrow money to pay for my children's tuition fees, to be repaid in three months. I wonder if this can be accommodated?"</p>
<p>[Reader Scholarship Fund Committee Reply] We have read your letter with great sympathy for your difficult situation. The "lending money for tuition, to be repaid in three months, etc." you mentioned does not comply with the application guidelines stipulated by this newspaper, and we are unable to process it. The application procedure for the "Reader Scholarship Fund" organized by this newspaper requires the student to first apply to the school they are attending, be recommended by the principal, and obtain an application form from this newspaper (see yesterday's edition of this newspaper), and then be reviewed to determine whether to accept the application. If you wish to apply for this scholarship for your four children who are currently in school, please apply according to the procedures stipulated by this newspaper.</p>

<h3>Love Triangle: One Wave After Another: Triangular Romance Turns Into a Mess: Abandoned Woman Happily Meets an Old Flame: Rekindles Old Love Into a "Qin-Jin" Union</h3>
<p>[This newspaper reports] The District Court recently received a statement from a young woman from Southeast Asia, Zhu Jie, requesting a notarized separation from her cohabitation relationship with Jin Zhixing. Zhu was originally a student at a specialized school in Southeast Asia, and was friendly with male classmates Qin Jin and Jin Zhixing, which gradually developed into a love triangle. As a result, Zhu fell in love with Jin and discussed marriage. However, Zhu's mother liked Qin and disliked Jin, and did not approve of her marriage to Jin. Zhu disregarded her family's opposition and ran away from home with Jin to Nanjing in August of the 33rd year, where they began cohabiting. After the victory, due to financial difficulties, Jin went back and forth to Hong Kong as a freelance broker. At this time, Zhu received a letter from her mother at home, saying that she missed her daughter very much and hoped she would return home to talk. Zhu also took the time to return to Southeast Asia because she had been away from home for a long time and her husband was in Hong Kong. Unexpectedly, after Zhu returned to Southeast Asia, she learned that Jin had found someone else in Hong Kong, and also learned that Qin Jin had suffered from mental illness due to his love for Zhu after they left Southeast Asia, and was almost crazy. Zhu went to visit him, and Qin's illness suddenly improved. Zhu was touched by Qin's dedication to her, and agreed to devote herself to him. However, Qin had one condition, which was that Zhu must completely break off her relationship with Jin. Zhu went to Hong Kong to find Jin to handle the procedures for breaking off the cohabitation relationship, but was unable to find him. It was said that he had gone to Shanghai. Then she went to Shanghai to look for him but still could not find him. Because Zhu was eager to return to Southeast Asia, she filed a statement with the District Court requesting notarization of her separation from her cohabitation relationship with Jin Zhixing.</p>
<h3>Inside Information in the Beef Shop Robbery Case: Five Suspects Arrested One After Another</h3>
<p>[This newspaper reports] At 9:35 PM on the 18th of last month, four bandits broke into the Maolin Beef Shop at 92 Maoming South Road, used the excuse of buying two bottles of orange juice to threaten the shop assistant Shan Yunting and others with guns, and robbed them of American dollars, national currency, gold bars, gold jewelry, and other items, estimated to be worth over 100 million yuan, and fled without a trace. Afterwards, the owner, Zhu Guishan, reported the case to the Lujiawan Police Station. Director Zhao, upon receiving the report, urgently ordered Section Chief Hao of the Criminal Investigation Section to dispatch Inspector Qin and police officers Hao Chen, Ma Shaosong, and Liu Guozhang to investigate. The owner was questioned in detail about the incident, and it was believed that there must have been inside information. Undercover officers were dispatched to the vicinity of the shop to patrol and secretly investigate the whereabouts of the bandits. At 10:00 AM on the 19th, a man was seen loitering in the area, acting suspiciously, and whispering to the shop assistant. It was later learned that the man's name was Zhu Achang, 21 years old, from Ningbo, residing at 218 Xinxin Lane, 409 Zhongzheng South 2nd Road. Three months ago, he was a shop assistant. Therefore, at 9:30 AM on the 23rd, he was arrested on Maoming South Road, Linsen Middle Road, and taken to the station for interrogation. He finally confessed to the robbery and implicated his accomplices Li Yingchun (also known as A Hong), Zhu Amao, and the shop employee Li Agen as an inside accomplice who planned the robbery. The police arrested them together on Zhongzheng South 2nd Road and Maoming South Road, and also arrested the receiver of stolen goods, Xu Fuhe, and recovered part of the stolen goods. The case has been fully investigated and will be submitted to the District Court this month for handling.</p>
<h3>Li Shifan Accused of Forgery: His Girlfriend Claims a Romantic Relationship: Fondly Requests Bail</h3>
<p>[This newspaper reports] Lu Ying (Xiao Ying), the female owner of the Meiguang Shoe Shine Company on Xizang Middle Road, accused Li Shifan of forgery and fraud. The District Prosecutor's Office has detained Li and filed a public prosecution. Unexpectedly, Lu, cherishing old feelings, felt heartbroken upon seeing Li detained, and filed a statement with the District Prosecutor's Office requesting bail for Li. Her petition stated, "The plaintiff, complying with the repeated requests of the family of the defendant Li Shifan, and considering that the plaintiff and the defendant Li Shifan previously had a romantic relationship, and not without regard for old feelings, the defendant is young and inexperienced, and thus fell into the clutches of the law. The circumstances are excusable, and the defendant's family has a large number of people who depend on him for support. Once imprisoned, their livelihood will be cut off, which is even more pitiful. Therefore, I am filing this statement requesting your review and approval, and considering that the defendant is a first-time offender, to leniently grant bail so that he can rehabilitate himself. I will be eternally grateful." Yesterday, the prosecutor's remarks on this wonderful document were few: "Received. This case has already been filed for public prosecution and will be sent to the criminal court for handling."</p>

<h3>Delivering Love Letters and Fantasizing: Lawyer Deceived and Lost Money: Finally Realizing It's Intolerable</h3>
<p>[This newspaper reports] Lawyer Ji Chao filed a lawsuit with the Tilanqiao Police Station last month accusing Wang Qinggui of fraud. After the police station arrested Wang, he was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Wang Qinggui, 26 years old, from Baoshan, opened the Qingcheng Rice Shop at 947 Dong Yuhang Road. Because business was slow and funds were tight, he borrowed 3 million yuan from Ji in June. Ji asked him for a guarantor, but Wang forged two seals of the Nanyang Iron Factory and Yu Siren and stamped them on the IOU, defrauding him of 3 million yuan. Not long after, the rice shop closed down and Wang fled to Tianjin, and then returned to Shanghai. He suddenly had a bizarre idea, falling in love with Ji Chao's daughter, Ji Guoying. He sent love letters to Ji's daughter, calling her Miss Mary, persuading her to leave her family, and arranging to meet her at the Queen's Cafe on Sanma Road at 3 PM on the 22nd of last month. After Ji's daughter received the letter, she told her father, who then reported it to the Tilanqiao Police Station. Police officers were dispatched to wait. When Wang arrived late, he was arrested. After Wang confessed to fraud and being in love with Ji's daughter, he was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation and released on bail pending trial.</p>

<h3>On the Eve of the Xi'an-Shanghai-Hankou Joint Passenger and Freight Transport: The Longhai Railway Is Being Improved</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch From Xi'an, August 25, From Our Correspondent Li Chi</p>
<p>Eighth Timber Bridge on the Longhai Line: Impresses Foreign Engineers</p>
<p>[Dispatch From Xi'an, August 25] The eighth timber bridge on the Longhai Railway, which impressed foreign engineers with its amazing construction, has now been completed at risk. It measures 118 feet long and 42 meters high. Part of the bridge has been rebuilt into a reinforced concrete bridge, but traffic has never been interrupted for a single day.</p>
<p>The Longhai Railway extends from Lianyungang in the east to Tianshui in the west, a total of more than 1,600 kilometers, making it the longest east-west railway trunk line in our country. However, due to repeated destruction by natural and man-made disasters during and after the war, the Tong (Guan) Luo (Yang) section and the Tian (Shui) Bao (Ji) section were hastily built, so the entire line has not yet been fully connected, and even those that can be used are often operated intermittently. However, in the past nine months, since the new Director Mo Heng took office, he has been determined to rectify the situation. The 16-kilogram light rails in the entire line were first completely replaced, and 200,000 new sleepers were replaced. The temporary bridges and roads between Tongguan and Shaanxi Prefecture were eliminated and replaced with standard bridges and roads. The Xian (Yang) Tong (Chuan) branch line was improved, and the Tongguan Tunnel was completed. The wages for all of the above totaled 45 billion yuan! The local appearance of the Longhai Line has been renewed since then. However, the complete rectification and smooth flow of the entire line still awaits the completion of the following projects in progress. Please start with a brief description from the western end:</p>
<p>The Baotian Railway is only 100 kilometers long, but it has 120 tunnels, an average of one tunnel per li, which is visible here. Moreover, the slope in this section is very large, and the entire line is built windingly on sandy hills, facing the mountains and water. During construction, limited by manpower, financial resources, and time, the tunnels had to be shortened as much as possible, and the passages that should have been built at the tunnel entrances were replaced by "open cuts." Moreover, the slope on both sides is far from the angle of a "natural slope," so it is inevitable that the sand and soil on both sides will collapse during the rainy season or due to driving. Therefore, the number of collapses in the Baotian section is the highest in the country. More than 400,000 cubic meters of collapses were cleared last year, and more than 100,000 cubic meters this year. In recent weeks, the rainy season has arrived in Shaanxi and Gansu. In just a few days, the collapses have reached 40,000 cubic meters. Although the clearing is being stepped up, it is expected that it will collapse again after clearing. A thorough solution may not be possible in the short term. However, the employees of this section have always done their best.</p>
<p>Man fighting against nature will be able to resume operation after the rainy season ends this autumn.</p>
<p>The Tongguan Tunnel on the border between Shaanxi and Henan was bombed by the Japanese army across the river hundreds of times during the war. The cave was shaken and cracks appeared. In recent years, it has been supported by wooden frames with great effort, which is not a safe long-term plan. In May this summer, construction of a new tunnel with a length of 468 meters began. Due to the impact of the war in Fenglingdu recently, the project has been postponed until the beginning of next month.</p>
<p>The 300-kilometer track east of Shaanxi Prefecture to Zhengzhou was temporarily assembled after the victory, and the variety of styles can be called the "World Rail Exhibition." The impact on driving speed and safety is significant. Although the 16-kilogram light rails in the section have been replaced, there are still 60-pound, 65-pound, and other mixed rails interspersed between them. It is expected that all of them will be replaced with</p>
<p>Standard heavy rails by the end of this year to increase the load capacity.</p>
<p>Between the Xiashi Station and Guanyintang Station (belonging to Mianchi County, Henan), there is a large bridge with a length of more than 100 meters and a height of 40 meters, commonly known as the "Eighth Bridge." In the past, in order to expedite traffic, a timber bridge was erected at risk. However, limited by the load capacity, only small locomotives could pull 200-ton trains through. In other words, trains between Xuzhou and Zhengzhou with a tonnage of 1,200 to 1,500 tons have to be divided into six or seven trains at this bottleneck, which greatly affects the transport volume and speed. In May of this year, renovation began, using the original steel beams for repair and building a Western-style concrete bridge. Moreover, since this formal bridge is built on the same site as the timber bridge, in order to maintain the continued operation of the timber bridge, only a part of the timber can be removed at a time, and then reinforced concrete piers are built to support it. The construction procedure is extremely laborious. At present, 90% of the entire project has been completed, and it is expected to be completed by the middle of next month.</p>
<p>Between Heishiguan and Xiaoyi stations east of Luoyang, there is also a large bridge across the Luo River, with a total of seven holes and a length of 310 meters, making it the longest on the Haizhou Line. Among them,</p>
<p>The timber bridge was washed away by water at the end of last month, and at present only wooden boats are used to connect the two sides. It is expected that although the construction of the temporary bridge will be stepped up before the end of the rainy season at the end of September, it may still be washed away again at any time even if it is open to traffic. The permanent concrete bridge foundations have long been completed, and most of the steel beams allocated by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration have been shipped to Shanghai. After being erected in Shanghai, they will be disassembled and transported to Luoyang for assembly. The solution to the problem is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>There are still a dozen small bridges between Luoyang and Zhengzhou. The concrete piers have been built one after another, and 56 holes of steel beams under the US-Canada loan have also been allocated by the Ministry of Communications. It is expected that all the main bridges will be completed within this year. In this way,</p>
<p>Huge hangars can tow long trains and pass smoothly.</p>
<p>The Minquan, Xiaoba, and Shangqiu sections east of Kaifeng were destroyed again on the 10th of this month, but were repaired on the 16th.</p>
<p>East of Xuzhou, it has been repaired to Xin'an Town, and west of Lianyungang, it has been repaired to Baitabu. The distance between the two ends of the secondary road is about 70 kilometers of track. If they are collected separately, the whole project can be completed. The Railway Bureau has submitted another plan to the Ministry of Communications for approval. If it proceeds smoothly and is no longer affected by military affairs, it is expected that by the end of this year, it will be possible to travel directly from Lianyungang to Baoji, transfer to a small locomotive, and trace Tianshui to the west. Then the equipment of the Tianlan Railway, as well as the sea salt in the northwest that depends on the coast, can be unloaded and transported directly from Lianyungang. The furs of Gansu and Qinghai and the famous Shaanxi cotton can also be sold to the east through this route. As early as next month when the "Eighth Bridge" is open, the Railway Bureau plans to implement the following freight and passenger services: (1) A direct express train between Chang'an and Xuzhou is planned to run once a day; (2) Joint passenger and freight transport between Chang'an and Shanghai, and is responsible for compensating for accidental losses; (3) Joint passenger and freight transport between Zhengzhou and Pukou; (4) Joint passenger and freight transport between Chang'an and Hankou.</p>
<h3>Henan Land and Food Bureau Responds to the Ministry of Food: Request to Temporarily Delay the Lifting of Food Transport Restrictions</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kaifeng, 27th of this Month] Previously, Henan Province, in order to stabilize grain prices, had regulations prohibiting the transportation of grain out of the province. Recently, the Ministry of Food, considering that the wheat harvest for this year had passed and the grain situation had improved, ordered the province to report on the abolition of the previous measures. After receiving the order, the Land and Food Bureau reported that: (1) banditry is rampant in the province, and this year has seen both drought and flooding. During the wheat harvest, eastern and northern Henan were widely looted by bandits, and grain sources are tight. At this time of mobilizing to suppress the rebellion, with large armies gathering, the army's logistical support has suddenly increased. If grain transportation restrictions are lifted, it will inevitably lead to grain being transported out of the province, making requisitioning and borrowing difficult. (2) More than fifty counties in the province are bandit areas. Military commanders have repeatedly sent telegrams ordering the strengthening of grain blockade. If this blockade is lifted, grain may be transferred to support the bandits, which is difficult to prevent. Affecting the people's food is a minor matter, but delaying military supplies is a major one. (3) In recent years, the supply and demand of grain in Henan Province have been balanced, and grain price fluctuations have not been severe. This is all due to the prohibition of transportation to other provinces. Currently, grain prices in neighboring provinces to the east and west are higher than in this province. If transportation restrictions are lifted, the people will compete to sell food and transport it out, which will inevitably create a grain panic in this province, a matter of great importance. (4) Grain can be freely transported between counties in Henan Province, and strict orders have been issued to all counties to comply with this, and there is no obstruction of transportation. Based on the above points, due to the special circumstances of this province, after careful consideration, it is still necessary to continue to implement the prohibition of grain transportation out of the province. A telegram was sent to the Ministry of Food requesting a temporary delay in lifting the restrictions, in order to prevent future troubles.</p>
<h3>Strange Fetus in Fujian: One Child, One Monkey, One Duck</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Fuzhou, August 29th] The wife of a Mr. Chen, a resident of Pengcheng Township in Changle, eastern Fujian, recently gave birth to one child, one monkey, and one duck, shocking the neighborhood and spreading as a strange tale. After investigation, it was learned that the woman was nine months pregnant and suddenly complained of severe abdominal pain a few days ago, becoming breathless. The villagers rushed into the city at night to invite a doctor to the village for emergency treatment and injections. First, a girl was born, but the abdomen was still in severe pain, and the placenta had not yet detached. The doctor performed surgery again, and after more than ten hours, two dead fetuses were removed. One weighed about six pounds, with one head, four hands, and four feet, and a face like a monkey. The other weighed about three pounds, with no anus or reproductive organs, covered in hair, and very similar to a duck. It seems that a mixture of humans and animals was born in one pregnancy, which the villagers found very surprising and suspected to be an ominous sign.</p>
<h3>Military Staff Member in Jinshan Embezzles Conscription Funds and Flees; County Magistrate Orders Arrest</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Jinshan, August 30th] A few military service personnel have been found to have conscripted more soldiers than needed and overcharged villagers for food rations to enrich themselves privately. Pan Qunpu, a military staff member of the Jinshan County Government, took advantage of the transition between the old and new county magistrates to introduce new recruits to various townships and towns, charging a price of six million per person. Subsequently, Huangqiao Township prepaid nine million yuan, Maogang Township six million yuan, and Damang Township one million yuan, with the remaining payment to be made when the new recruits were picked up. On the 28th, the township head Xu Haiyuan and others went to his residence to pay the money and pick up the recruits for camp, but unexpectedly Pan had moved everything away with his family in the late night of the 27th and fled without a trace.

<h3>Failed Attempt to Raise Rent, Sudden Cruelty: Mother of Li Ming, Former Manchurian Star, Kidnaps Without Success, Steals Ring Instead</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, September 1st] Another incident has occurred regarding the house in the care of Mr. Yu Youren, managed by the mother of former Manchurian star Li Ming. Li Ming's mother threatened the tenant to increase the rent, causing a soldier, Wu Wende, to attempt to kidnap the tenant without success and then commit robbery, which led to his arrest. Mr. Yu Youren owns a house at No. 1 Juer Hutong in Beiping. During the Anti-Japanese War, he entrusted Li Ming to manage it. Li was sentenced to prison for treason because of suspicion that he had plotted to harm her former husband, who was working underground. Li's mother continued to look after the house for Mr. Yu Youren. To increase the rent, she had several quarrels with the tenant, Liu Renfeng, and suspected that Li Ming's imprisonment was due to her report. A few days ago, she threatened that if the rent was not increased, they would "see what would happen," and then ordered Lu Jingde and two others to kidnap her. On the 30th, in the heavy rain, the three strong men entered the house. Seeing that the Liu family was eating corn bread, they failed to kidnap her and only stole three rings and a leather suitcase from the Liu family before leaving. Afterwards, Liu reported the incident, and all the criminals were arrested.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Massive Fraud Case: Fictitious Salt Firm Defrauds One Hundred Million</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Wuxi, August 31st] Sheng Xinggen, from Shenganli, Huibei Township, Tangqiao District, in the western suburbs, falsely established a salt firm in July of this year and defrauded Tu Xiquan, Zha Jinmei, and 17 others of 506 zu of salt money, promising delivery by a deadline. However, the delivery was repeatedly postponed until nothing was delivered. In reality, the firm was completely fictitious, and a huge amount of money was defrauded. In addition, there were armed threats. Because Tu and others were concerned that Sheng Xinggen would flee, they arrested Sheng on the evening of the 30th and brought him to the North District Police Station for investigation. The next day happened to be Sunday, so it was decided that he would be transferred to the Police Headquarters on the 1st and then to the Prosecutor's Office for interrogation. Based on the current salt price, the value is about one hundred million yuan.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Volunteer Soldiers Crowd Military Service Demonstration Zone</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, August 30th] Since Jiangsu Province began recruiting volunteer soldiers, people from all counties north and south of the Yangtze River, who have suffered greatly from the communist bandits in the past, have learned from their pain and are eager to dedicate themselves to the country and eliminate the communist bandits to quell the source of chaos. Therefore, the number of applicants is extremely enthusiastic. It is reported that, as of now, the province has recruited 2,060 volunteer soldiers.</p>
<p>According to our newspaper reader Guan Cha: The new recruits who have been sent to Zhenjiang have been instructed on the methods of the military garrison area, the layout of their camp, and the daily necessities used by the new recruits, which have indeed entered the "military school" stage. This can be seen from the clean beds used by the new recruits, the white towels, and the tidy and clean cooking utensils. As for the nutritional problems of the new recruits, it can also be proved by the rosy complexions and energetic appearance of some new recruits that they have been properly resolved, but the person in charge of the military garrison area is not satisfied with this and still intends to gradually improve it in order to live up to the honorary title of "Military Service Demonstration Zone." It is reported that the resettlement allowance for new recruits in Zhenjiang, including everything, is said to be no more than five million yuan per person. In the Zhenjiang new recruit camp, there are the beloved sons of village chiefs, school teachers, college and middle school students, and employees of large shops. They are all volunteers to join the army and support the government's plan to suppress the rebellion and build the country with their actions. This is a good phenomenon that a "Military Service Demonstration Zone" should have.</p>
<p>Prices in Zhenjiang City have soared again. Cigarettes have risen the most sharply. Oils and general daily necessities are all rising in a straight line. Rice prices have risen by more than 10%, but because the battle situation in northern Jiangsu has improved, the source of rice is not a major problem, and rice prices can still be expected to fall back.</p>
<p>With the general election approaching, a prosperous future is beginning to be reflected in the Zhenjiang market. The hotel and restaurant industries have begun to prepare, and the restaurants that have been closed for a long time have put up new shop signs. However, those engaged in regional and professional group elections in Zhenjiang are mostly preparing and arranging with a very cautious attitude, especially the press, because in today's democratic learning, some enlightened people who have infinite hope for the future of the people's livelihood in China may "look to the reporters" without expecting it, to see how you do it. Therefore, when people hear that colleagues in the press in various parts of the province will handle a "reporter qualification issue" with a very cautious attitude, it seems very happy.

<h3>Annular Solar Eclipse on May 9th Next Year; Calculation Completed; Partial Eclipse Will Be Visible Throughout the Country; Eclipse Fraction Greatest in Shanghai and Hangzhou Area</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Qingdao, August 27th] The news of the "annular solar eclipse" on May 9th next year was first published in this newspaper. The calculation work has been completed by the Qingdao Observatory. It is now known that the path of the annular eclipse starts from 77 degrees 8 minutes east longitude and 2 degrees 33 minutes north latitude in the Indian Ocean and gradually moves towards the southeastern mainland of our country. At about 1:20 (Universal Time), it will land on the coast near Lianjiang, Guangdong. The width of the annular eclipse visible in that area is about 19 kilometers, and the length of the central eclipse time is about 19 seconds. From then on, it will traverse the southeastern mainland of our country, passing through Lianjiang, Xinyi, Luoding, the Shakou Station of the Yuehan Railway, Nanxiong, Shixing, Ganzhou, Ningdu Huangpi Town, Nanfeng, the Dalu Station of the Zhegan Railway, Kaihua Huabu Town, Ningan, Wukang, Wujiang, Taicang Shuangfeng Town, Lusi Port and other places. The width of the annular eclipse visible along the way and the length of the annular eclipse time will gradually decrease. At more than 1:50 (Universal Time), reaching the vicinity of Lusi Port, the area where the annular eclipse can be seen is only about 3.5 kilometers wide, and the length of the annular eclipse is 4.7 seconds. After that, it will resume its maritime life, and after carrying the Korean Peninsula, in the Sea of Japan, at 132 degrees 47 minutes east longitude and 40 degrees 51 minutes north latitude, a total eclipse may occur in a short time. Afterwards, the width of the annular eclipse area and the length of the annular eclipse time will gradually increase until it ends the entire annular eclipse journey at 135 degrees 10 minutes west longitude and 43 degrees 40 minutes north latitude in the Pacific Ocean. A partial eclipse can be seen throughout our country. The earliest eclipse is seen in the southern Xisha Islands, and the latest is at the confluence of the Ussuri River and the Heilongjiang River. The total time for the eclipse to be seen within the country is about four hours. The eclipse fraction is the largest in the Shanghai and Hangzhou area, all above 99%, and gradually decreases towards the northwest.</p>

<h3>British Science Association Holds First Post-War Meeting; Penicillin Inventor to Lecture</h3>
<p>[British News Service, London, September 1st] The British Science Association is holding its first post-war meeting today. An editorial in the "Observer" weekly stated: "The association was suddenly interrupted by the war on September 1, 1939, during the Dundee Conference, and is now resuming in the same place. The speech by President Sir Kerr on Wednesday of last week was of great significance, stating that the war obviously stimulated science greatly because its practical application was urgently needed.

<p>[British News Service, London, August 31st] Sir Alexander, the British inventor of penicillin, lectured yesterday at the British Science Association.</p>
<h3>Joint Annual Meeting of Seven Scientific Organizations Successfully Concludes Yesterday; Launch Initiative to Organize National Federation of Scientific Organizations</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The joint annual meeting of seven scientific organizations, including the China Science Society, was held for three days. The meeting proceeded smoothly and concluded successfully yesterday afternoon. Hundreds of members, including Ren Hongjun, Zhu Kezhen, Qiu Weiyu, Lu Yudao, and Zhang Mengwen, attended the various meetings for the past three days despite the hot summer, and engaged in heated discussions. The annual meeting achieved great success, which has profound significance for the advancement of scientific research in our country in the future. At 3 pm yesterday, the seven organizations held an administrative meeting at the Shanghai Medical College, presided over by Lu Yudao, the general secretary of the annual meeting, to discuss important proposals and resolve as follows: (1) The issue of unifying the "World Calendar," which was approved by the Ministry of Education in the 24th year of the Republic of China, will be replied to the World Calendar Society as originally proposed. (2) The Nanjing Joint Association Office will be convened by the China Society of Natural Sciences to handle the matter.

<h3>Professor Zhang Qiyun Gave a Lecture at the YMCA Yesterday: China in Suffering</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The joint annual meeting of the seven scientific organizations held a public lecture at the YMCA Auditorium in the Baixianqiao at 3 pm yesterday, with Professor Zhang Qiyun giving a lecture on the topic of "China in Suffering." He discussed China's border issues from the perspective of political geography, stating that the Lushun-Dalian issue has been a source of turmoil in East Asia since the end of the 19th century. Its impact can be compared to Istanbul in the Mediterranean. After the war, the Soviet Union demanded joint defense of Istanbul, which Turkey flatly refused, but China could not. Now Lushun-Dalian is the center of international communist activity in the three major peninsulas of Northeast China (Korea, Liaodong, and Shandong). Conversely, economically, international trade has not yet been opened up, and it is actually a dead port. The serious situation in Northeast China has not diminished compared to the September 18th Incident. The area of Outer Mongolia that was lost is greater than that of Northeast China, and its population is only 800,000, less than that of Nanjing City. It is difficult to form an independent country on its own, but it is actually invading our Xinjiang, which is just one wave in a large trend. The overall situation in Xinjiang is turbulent and unstable, and the special situation in the three districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan has not yet improved. If the conspiracy of the Turkestan Republic is not stopped, Xinjiang may become the second Outer Mongolia, with endless troubles. Tibet has a high degree of autonomy, and is only one step away from independence. The area west of the Jinsha River is already beyond reach. Since the recent coup in Tibet, the centrifugal force has been strengthened. The boundary between northern Yunnan and Burma has not yet been demarcated. The Jiangxinpo and Hugong Valley originally belonged to China, and the area connects China and India. A highway was built here during the war to drive out the Japanese invaders. The Yunnan-Burma border issue cannot remain unresolved for long. In terms of the sea border, after the recovery of Guangzhou Bay, it was renamed Zhanjiang City, which will be the export port for the future southwest railway trunk line. The outdated colonial system of Hong Kong and Macao urgently needs to be resolved satisfactorily through peaceful negotiations. The recovery of Taiwan and the establishment of Hainan Province are great opportunities for our country to restore its maritime power. Taiwan was occupied for half a century, and its national consciousness is still strong. The recent incident was aimed at reforming internal affairs, but it has left a bad impression internationally. In short, China is currently in the midst of internal and external troubles, with the two causing and seeking each other. The problem with the Soviet Union is the first diplomatic difficulty. The various crises in Sino-Soviet relations are due to the imbalance of national power between the two countries. Only by making concerted efforts to increase production and build the country in earnest can we increase national power and ensure internal and external security. Agriculture, forestry, fishery, mining, water conservancy, industry, transportation, and trade are the nine major guidelines for building the country. Northeast China, the northern border, the northwest, the western border, the southwest, the great river, the Yangtze River, Lingnan, and the islands are the nine major areas for construction. If any guideline or any area is slightly unbalanced, it can lead to major incidents. There is no shortcut to saving the country. Foreign aid is unreliable. Only by overall planning for production and construction can we seek a balance of national power between China and foreign countries, so as to ensure sovereignty and maintain peace.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Yesterday (the 1st) morning, the Chinese Geographical Society held its first paper meeting at the Shanghai Medical College, with more than 30 people, including Zhu Kezhen, attending and presenting more than ten papers. Xie Jiarong, a member of the Resources Committee and director of the Mineral Exploration Office, presented a paper on the mineral resources of the Dahuainan Basin, stating that according to recent surveys, the coal reserves in the Huainan Coal Mine in Anhui Province are over 1 billion tons, exceeding those of the Kailuan Coal Mine. This is the most important discovery in coal production in recent years and is extremely important for the supply of power for industrialization in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River.</p>
<h3>China Commercial Bank Establishes Memorial Scholarship</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Commercial Bank, founded in the 23rd year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the former Qing dynasty, was the first bank established in our country. This year, April 26th, marks the 50th anniversary of the bank's founding. Mr. Du Yuesheng, a director of the bank, in order to cultivate talent for national service, and to commemorate the 50th anniversary of its founding, has specially allocated a special fund of 100 million national currency as a scholarship fund, and accepted cash gifts from all sectors totaling more than 150 million yuan, which will also be used as part of the scholarship fund. The bank will organize a scholarship management committee to use the interest to assist poor students.

<h3>Mayor Wu Sternly States: Overcharging Tuition Will Be Prosecuted as Embezzlement; Secret Reports Will Be Accepted and Thoroughly Investigated and Punished</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Mayor Wu, concerned about the few schools in this city that are overcharging tuition and miscellaneous fees, specially invited reporters from various newspapers to the Municipal Government Reception Room at 5:30 pm yesterday to report on the following four points: (1) The amount of fees to be charged by each school in the next semester has been discussed and decided by the Municipal Government and relevant authorities. No school is allowed to exceed this amount. Recently, the Municipal Government has received many confidential letters from various sectors, reporting on the arbitrary collection of tuition fees by various schools. The Municipal Government will conduct a thorough investigation, and those found to be true will be punished. (2) Any school that requests an increase in tuition fees due to good facilities and excellent academic performance shall not overcharge before the Education Bureau has approved it. Otherwise, the Municipal Government will prosecute it as embezzlement. It is hoped that all schools can take the lead in promoting the spirit of abiding by the law. (3) The Municipal Government will first set a reasonable standard for tuition fees for the next semester, and at the same time, it will hold scholarships. It has now raised 5.1 billion yuan and is still actively proceeding. There should be no problem with tuition fees for the next semester. (4) The recent establishment of the "Student Academic Guarantee Association" in this city is something that the Municipal Government has no idea how it came about, and its content seems to be specious. The Municipal Government will not allow the existence of such an illegal organization that borrows a name. In the future, if students have any difficulties, they can negotiate with me in a private capacity.</p>
<p>Municipal Government and Education Bureau Establish Investigation Team</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Mayor Wu once convened a meeting of principals of private primary and secondary schools, and stipulated that the standard for fees charged by private schools should be 1 million for high school, 800,000 for junior high school, and 500,000 for primary school in principle, but schools with excellent facilities, a long history, and open finances may apply for an increase. After this regulation was announced, general schools requested increases. In order to strictly enforce the regulations, the Municipal Government and the Education Bureau each sent three representatives to form three investigation teams, each with two members, to conduct on-site investigations at various schools. There are two investigation items: (1) those who request an increase in accordance with the regulations of the Municipal Government; (2) those who request an increase in construction fees. It is reported that the investigation began last Saturday, and it is stipulated that 20 schools will be investigated every day, and a total of 100 schools in the city will be investigated, and all investigations will be completed within this week.</p>
<p>It is hoped that all parents will report to the government</p>
<p>The Municipal Government issued an order to the Municipal Education Bureau, saying: "It is found that the upper semester of this year in this city is about to begin. The fee standards for private primary and secondary schools have been stipulated and should be notified to all schools immediately: (1) Absolutely no fees shall exceed the stipulated fees; (2) Those who are collecting fees and exceeding the regulations should immediately announce the refund at the beginning of the school year; (3) Those who apply for over-quota collection shall not collect the excess before the bureau has approved it, and should wait for the approval before announcing the bureau's approval documents in the school for supplementary collection; (4) For schools that do not comply with the regulations, the bureau will order the board of directors to remove its负责人and report within a prescribed time limit, otherwise the bureau will send personnel to act as代理。The Bureau is ordered to strictly comply with the above and report at any time!" In addition, the Municipal Education Bureau issued a public notice, stating: "The highest fee standards for private primary and secondary schools are 500,000 yuan for primary schools, 800,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 1 million yuan for high schools. If there are any excesses, it is hoped that the parents of students and all sectors of society will report them. The Education Bureau will also send personnel to secretly investigate, and those found will be severely punished."</p>
<p>Academic Guarantee Association to be Banned by the Police Bureau</p>
<p>Recently, the "Shanghai Student Academic Guarantee Federation" in this city issued a declaration and posted slogans, but since there is no address, no person in charge, no list of participating schools and representatives, and no registration with the Accounting and Statistics Bureau, Li, the Deputy Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, issued a written statement, stating that since the association has not been registered, it has announced its establishment and openly carried out activities, which is a clear violation of the General Mobilization Order issued by the National Government. In order to maintain national laws and regulations and maintain social peace, this bureau has transferred the matter to the police bureau for prohibition, ordering the association to stop all activities from now on.</p>

<h3>After Settlement Procedures are Agreed Upon Today, US Treasury Bills Can be Sold; National Bank has Received Order to Settle Based on US Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The order for the 36-year short-term treasury bills, which were approved by the Executive Yuan, to be repaid with principal and interest based on the US exchange rate, was officially issued to the Central Bank yesterday. The bank originally planned to resume the sale of short-term treasury bills based on the US exchange rate after receiving the order. However, since the US exchange rate cannot be changed on a daily basis, there are technical difficulties in notifying the branches in various places to handle it uniformly. Mr. Liu, the Deputy Governor of the Head Office, Mr. Xu, the Vice Minister of Finance, and Mr. Chen, the Director of the Public Debt Department, met to discuss this matter yesterday afternoon. They believed that the technology was quite complicated, so although they had obtained an outline after the discussion, it still needed to be discussed further this morning. Once a final conclusion is reached, it is expected that the sale of short-term treasury bills can be officially resumed from tomorrow.</p>
<p>In addition, according to Fan Heyan, Deputy Secretary-General of the People's Gold Bond Issuance Committee; after the 府decided to depreciate the principal and interest according to the US exchange rate, not only can the people's faith in the government's determination to maintain credit be further enhanced, but also (1) it will arouse the people's interest in buying bonds. (2) A large amount of idle funds will have the opportunity to return. (3) The issuance and sale of 300 million US Treasury bills will become smoother. If the issuance amount is increased in the future, or if other bonds are issued, it will make the people more willing to buy them. (4) It is a reasonable and safe method to depreciate the principal and interest of foreign currency bonds according to the market price, and the people will definitely be eager to buy them.</p>

The North China region has 293,584 mu of salt fields, with this year's salt production expected to be 7 million dan, estimated to be half of the total salt production in the Changlu area. The Northeast region has 501,888 mu of salt fields, and if fully restored, it can produce 20 million dan annually. As this year marks the beginning of the restoration, and with continuous destruction by the communist bandits, the expected production is 2.5 million dan.</p>
<p>Ample Supply of Rayon Spot Goods: Sellers Eager to Sell, Market Declines</p>
<p>The spot market for rayon yesterday was already showing a sufficient supply, and prices continued to decline. At the opening in the morning, 120 high-mountain rayon was quoted at 26.3 million yuan, and there were a few transactions with out-of-town sales accounts. By the midday closing, the selling price was 6.55 million yuan. In the afternoon, due to the continued allocation of rayon to the silk weaving industry, holders of goods were eager to sell, so the final price dropped by another 300,000 yuan to a selling price of 6.22 million yuan, a decrease of 1 million yuan compared to the previous weekend.</p>
<p>Raw Silk</p>
<p>Presented a fluctuating situation. Due to the unwillingness of holders to sell at low prices, sales accounts remained in a wait-and-see state, resulting in very few transactions. Yesterday's market price for five dan heads remained unchanged, with no transactions. E-grade was quoted at 31.5 million yuan, slightly lower than the previous weekend, but still without any sales. Dried warp silk was relatively firm and expensive, with a quotation approximately 500,000 yuan higher than the previous weekend. Yesterday, foreign company goods were quoted at 22 million yuan, with two other grades quoted at 20 million yuan and 21 million yuan.</p>
<p>Silk Fabrics</p>
<p>Due to factory dumping, the market for pure silk quilt covers was small yesterday. Dachang goods were traded at 400,000 yuan per piece after the market opened, and then quickly declined. Huaqiang goods were traded at 300,000 yuan, with the smallest transaction at 260,000 to 270,000 yuan. After 9 o'clock, there was a slight rebound, with the largest transaction at 420,000 yuan for deferred delivery. The final closing price was 350,000 yuan for immediate delivery and 400,000 yuan for deferred delivery. The quoted price for Dachang goods was sometimes lower than Huaqiang goods, and the closing price was similar to Huaqiang. The quoted price for checkered crepe remained unchanged, but there were no transactions. High-grade Hua Jin crepe was traded at 25,000 yuan, and Minsheng printed tin silk was traded at 26,500 yuan.</p>
<p>China Trust Bureau Allocated 350 Boxes of Silk</p>
<p>The China Trust Bureau continued to allocate rayon to the silk weaving industry yesterday, accounting for one-tenth of the previously approved demand. A total of 364 applicants were allocated over 350 boxes of silk. The allocation price this week was higher than last week, with Dafugui priced at 21.3 million yuan and Tianqiao Jin Sanma and other brands priced at 21 million yuan.</p>
<p>Silk Weaving Guidance Association First Phase Concludes</p>
<p>The Silk Weaving Export Guidance Committee, organized under the leadership of the Central Bank to support exports and earn foreign exchange, began promoting the processing and export of raw silk in April of this year. The raw silk purchased by the China Trust Bureau was contracted to the silk weaving joint venture company for weaving. The first phase was originally planned as a three-month trial, weaving 80,000 bolts of silk fabrics. Later, due to the significant achievements and positive reviews from all parties, the committee decided to extend the period to the end of August, increasing the weaving by 30,000 bolts, for a total of 110,000 bolts. As the end of August approached, the committee scheduled a full committee meeting for 4 PM on September 1st to discuss the conclusion of the first phase. As for the second phase plan, the committee had already submitted it to the Foreign Trade Promotion Committee for review. After the reorganization and establishment of the Import and Export Management Committee, this document was transferred for deliberation. The second phase will increase to 200,000 bolts and expand the scope, dividing Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces into Hangzhou and Shanghai districts. The silk fabrics woven by the committee are mainly sold to India, with five batches shipped so far, totaling 62,000.</p>
<p>China Textile Assets in Qingdao and Tianjin to be Revalued</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The China Textile Assets Valuation Committee, in order to revalue the assets of China Textile factories in Qingdao and Tianjin, will send eight experts in early September to work with China Textile personnel to handle all matters. It is expected to take more than a month. If circumstances permit, they will also visit the Northeast.

<p>Social Services Response to Ms. Xiuwen (Original Letter Published in Yesterday's Newspaper)</p>
<p>Ms. Xiuwen: We have received and read your letter. We sympathize deeply with your situation. However, we regret to say that we cannot offer much help. Although engaging in physical relations with your loved one before marriage may have been due to impulse and overwhelming emotions, it was still an irrational act that could have serious consequences. Now that things have developed to this point, the path you should follow is clear. First, you should honestly tell your mother about what happened to gain her understanding. If she is a truly loving mother, she will forgive you. Second, you should inform your loved one and try to get married as soon as possible if possible. For the sake of your own future happiness and the future status of your child in society, we believe this is the best course of action. As for your father, he may still "strongly disapprove," but as the situation has already evolved to this point, perhaps he will no longer stubbornly hold his prejudices.</p>
<p>Abortion is not only harmful to your body but also a violation of criminal law (please note Article 288 of Chapter 24 of the Criminal Code on abortion). Do not attempt it under any circumstances, or it will bring tragic consequences. (Editor)</p>

<p>The Comedies of Trieste by Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Clowns wearing colorful clothes, without any sense of time, roaming everywhere with guitars and huqins, are the favorite subject matter of Italian playwrights. These clowns are wanderers, still drifting around, and no one knows where they will go.</p>
<p>What is described here are the comedies of Trieste. Trieste is a city on the Italian coast, 73 miles northeast of Venice. The old city was built on a steep mountain, while the current city is on the coast. The most important leader in the comedy world is Cecchelin, who performs at the Teatro Filodrammatico.</p>
<p>The stage obviously has no windows, and the audience feels unusually hot when they enter, with the air filled with tobacco smoke. This stage has been open for seventeen years, mocking those who boast and have authority. The year of its creation was August 1929. The first play was "The Street of Commerce" (La Strada del Commercio) by Leghissa. Leghissa was also an actor on the stage. Cecchelin became famous for this play, rising to become a leading star. Unfortunately, the plays performed were too short. Cecchelin performed for a month and a half in front of an indifferent audience, perhaps needing to find another path. Fortunately, he had Woelfier behind him, who believed he was worth cultivating.</p>
<p>His hatred of dictatorship was strong and difficult to hide, so he received 187 warnings, was monitored, and was arrested three times. His performances were also punished with suspensions: the first time for 40 days, the second time for seven months, and the third time for twenty-two months.</p>
<p>Every time he went on stage, the audience waited for him. His humor could cater to the psychology of Italians, who are lazy, comfortable, and happy. He believed in "Anyone" (Uomoqualumque) ideology, and was extremely helpful to others. Sometimes irrelevant people would knock on his bedroom door. He would put on his pajamas, open the door to greet them, and the guest would tell a story of suffering, speaking of how he had been persecuted by nationalism. Naturally, he took the money and left. A series of such people, each telling a story more touching than the last. He used a lot of money for good deeds; when the money ran out, he gave away clothes. When he had given away all his money and clothes, he went to jail in his pajamas, and no one came to visit him in jail.</p>
<p>What best expresses Marchilin's personality is when he is talking to friends on the street in the play. He used the convenience of the clown to talk about political situations and foreign affairs.</p>
<p>Frontier by Ren Weiyin</p>
<p>This is a poor little town, with a very flat and smooth street running through the northeast, but this is a relic of history, belonging to a very short stage in the town's long years. Now, this little town only has rows of dilapidated houses, displaying the marks of wind and rain erosion. Under the black, short, and broken houses, pairs of dead fish-like eyes are always secretly spying on something, trying to discover something in this empty space. On both sides, bare and dilapidated high mountains, covered with straw raincoats of weeds, are like the people in this town, carrying out ancient lookouts in the wind and sand. But under this yellow earth is buried full of alkali, and the natural salt spring has long been exhausted. The dreams of past prosperity have disappeared in time, just like the bare mountains are weathering away. Everything here is quiet, sluggish, and lifeless.</p>
<p>Two intersecting roads extend out of the green shade on the labor wall. People also live inside. Winding paths and small bridges cross the flowing water. There are remnants of the railings and painted bars scattered on both sides. The stagnant water under the bridge is already dirty, but in spring there are still white double-petal peach blossoms secretly revealing some beauty in the bushes, symbolizing the past prosperity. In the eyes of a mourner, it is so cold and terrible that he doesn't even dare to look at it directly.</p>
<p>The street is quiet all day long. The doors of every house are open. The faded commodities are still propping up the facade of every shop, seemingly just out of habit. Passing a few shops, there is always a teahouse, with thick phlegm covering the ground and the half-circle in front of the shop. The tea drinkers sit sparsely. A senile old man sits deep under the parasol tree in front of the eaves, nostalgically dreaming of the emperor's tour. The coarse and spicy tobacco smell spreads into the air. From far away, a woman's voice is calling chickens. A commotion suddenly rises on the street. A sedan chair comes from the east gate, followed by two soldiers with long guns. The officer with a smoky face, looking like a dead foreigner, gets out of the sedan chair, yawns, turns around and enters the Gao2 Inn. The two soldiers take a box off the sedan chair and carry it into the house. The two people who are peeking secretly discuss; they know it is a priceless thing.</p>
<p>There are also shops on this street that are not open. The doors of one or two are always closed. People in yellow uniforms or long robes come in and out from time to time. There are often arguments inside. Once or twice, walking here, I saw two women walking in. From the printed cloth, it can be seen that they are still young. Those red paper-dyed lips, those full bodies, in this stagnant pool, will also be a pile of fire, and will burn something. I know what they do, but I also know that soon a rod-shaped or spherical bacterium will corrode all of this. Youth, in this kind of trade, is very short-lived.</p>
<p>There are also many products around this city, sweet potatoes, peanuts, and silkworm cocoons. Several years ago, this was a salt-producing area, but the salt source was insufficient and artificial fuel was needed. The salt wells have now been shut down. Because of sluggish sales, the mulberry trees that have been around for many years have been cut down as firewood. The people here eat sweet potatoes every day. Wealthy families eat half sweet potatoes and half rice, and difficult families eat a large pot of water and a few pitiful sweet potato sands. The land does not grow enough to feed the people on this land. People are a congenital consuming animal, and this city is becoming cyclically poor.</p>
<p>During the spring ploughing season, a clever gentleman, in order to attract the market north of the city to the east of the city, created a rumor that the Bodhisattva had manifested on the stone wall of the East Mountain. This time, the devout men and women gathered in the East City. In less than a year, a magnificent temple was built on this barren land. The county council also enthusiastically participated in the design and construction. The north of the city was unwilling to show weakness, so a filial son used the ditch water under the stone wall to cure his mother's eye disease. Naturally, the Bodhisattva in the north of the city must also build a temple to enjoy sacrifices. After the devout men and women raised a large amount of donations, the county council, therefore, sold a piece of public land at a high price and resolved to use the proceeds from the sale as travel expenses and office subsidies for the councilors.</p>
<p>The most lively time is, of course, the market; on market days, as soon as it dawns, the winter-style activity preparations begin. The most tense and powerful are the usurers and the tax collectors for various taxes. The restaurant prepares five or six times the dishes. This is a country of food. The hard-working far-comers always don't hesitate to spend thousands or eight hundred to have a full meal after selling a basket of peanuts or silkworm cocoons. Although wiping the oil from their mouths may be followed by the heaviness in their hearts, this is also regarded as natural by the miserable little people. The market is crowded with people from morning to night. In addition to various local products, you can also find relatively novel things. Northwestern Asian woolen textiles, held by some northerners, can also attract a large group of people. Wandering doctors, fortune tellers with ivory cards, spewing saliva and talking nonsense. A pair of leather shoes is surrounded by many villagers, reluctant to touch them and then walk away. The "masters" who have drunk until their faces are red, with thick necks, speak loudly everywhere, flaunting their power, and the street is always so bustling and bustling, with a constant stream of people... Until evening, everything quiets down again.</p>
<p>Time is ruthless, causing many people to strive to catch up or run! But unconsciously, more people and things are dying, unconsciously dying. Talking about humans from the story of apes may be very bizarre, but in many places, there are many people who are starting to regress to apes from the story of humans, but no one is aware of it. Is it that aging is simply allowed to age? That small city seems like another world. Thinking of those pairs of dead fish-like eyes always brings up a painful memory in my heart.</p>
<p>Recorded Orchid by Dai Wubi Qiaoer</p>
<p>Speel (Jean Deapujols) has circled through various forms of painting, and as a result, he finally broke away from all stereotypes and created a new path for himself. He negated the theories of all past schools of painting and put forward the slogan of "restoring the classics." As a result, critics called him a neo-classicist. His style is elegant and innovative, with a decorative interest. In the trend-setting Paris art world. He is a rare artist who is appreciated by both the refined and the popular. (Liu Shi)</p>
<p>Maupassant Fakes Death to Avoid Debt by Shou Juan</p>
<p>Assorted Fragments of Viola Gui'an</p>
<p>It seems to be the rule that all men of letters are poor, so even the wise and virtuous Han Changli, a great literary master of his generation, could not avoid writing "An Essay on Sending Away Poverty," which is truly enough to save the day! Perhaps "a scholar is useless in everything" and is destined to have an indissoluble bond with the ghost of poverty? However, poverty among men of letters is not only the case in China, but also in the West. The famous French novelist Maupassant (G. de Maupassant) is one such example. Maupassant wrote hundreds of short stories, all of which were elegant, incisive, and profound, earning him the title of "King of the Short Story." But although his novels were good, he was very poor. In Paris, he shared a small building with a painter. Because they were both extremely bored, they became very compatible and got along well with each other. Maupassant wrote the novels, and the painter provided the illustrations, submitting them to newspapers and magazines in exchange for some manuscript fees to maintain their livelihood. At that time, Maupassant owed a sum of money to a stationery merchant on Latin Street, which he could never pay back. He had agreed on a date, but broke his promise many times. The stationery merchant was an old man who was stingy by nature and had a Jewish style. He had come to the door to demand payment many times, but Maupassant not only had no money to pay him, but also mocked him with his glib tongue, making the old man furious and scolding him before leaving. One day, the old stationery merchant came again in a huff to demand payment, forcing Maupassant to pay, otherwise, he would have to move his furniture to auction it off as collateral. The painter quickly mediated from the side, repeatedly saying kind words and begging for a day's extension, saying that he would borrow money from a sculptor and pay the debt in full, promising not to break his word. The old man finally made a special accommodation and left, muttering to himself. The next morning, the painter went out to borrow money, and Maupassant lay in bed reading a humorous newspaper to relieve his boredom. Suddenly, he heard a burst of footsteps echoing on the stairs. Maupassant was shocked because he was familiar with these footsteps. It was clearly his creditor, the old stationery merchant! At this time, the painter had not been gone for long, and he did not know whether he could borrow the money or not. In order to avoid trouble, an idea suddenly came to mind. He immediately jumped out of bed, took paper and pen, and hurriedly wrote: "Mr. Maupassant died of a sudden illness on the 16th. Please contact Mr. Blanc to settle all outstanding debts." He wrote a false address below. Mr. Blanc was also fictitious. Then, he stuck this piece of paper on the outside of the door, hurried back to bed, and lay stiffly, pretending to be dead. After a while, he heard the old stationery merchant coming up the stairs into the room, panting like a hippopotamus. After a while, he heard him cursing in frustration, dragging his slow footsteps out. Maupassant was relieved and took a breath. Suddenly, he heard a delicate voice calling out to open the door. It was clearly Miss Marie next door, whom he usually loved deeply. So he jumped out of bed, opened the door to greet her, and after teasing each other for a while, Marie said goodbye and left. After a few minutes, he heard light footsteps on the stairs again, just like Marie. Perhaps she had returned because she was reluctant to leave him. He was very happy, and as soon as he heard the sound of knocking on the door, he immediately opened the door to welcome her. Who knew that standing outside the door was not the beautiful Miss Marie, but the hateful old stationery merchant? It turned out that he knew that Maupassant's sudden death was a delaying tactic, so he rushed back again, took off his leather boots, and went upstairs barefoot, so Maupassant mistook him for Marie. He could no longer get rid of the old man and had to wait bitterly for the painter to return. That day, he finally paid off the borrowed money and overcame the difficulties.</p>
<p>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Freedom by Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>We have two public matters to discuss: First, our team, under the name given by the First Team Leader of Beiping, is called the Special Operations Team. We have to handle both intelligence and guerrilla warfare. Our team will be the First Detachment, with the captain and deputy captain likely holding the rank of lieutenant. The rest of the brothers are all sergeant majors, sergeants, and corporals. Once the list is submitted, official orders will be issued, so we don't have to worry.</p>
<p>"The important thing is, how do you think we should get this group on the road? - Originally, we only planned for a dozen or twenty people - If we take the train, even if our village has a way, but the number is too large, forty or fifty people, we can only get to Jinzhou at most, and it will be difficult to go south from there.... What do you think?" Yaoqun gave Laolong the first action topic.</p>
<p>"Responding to the team leader, sir," Laolong changed his address to Yaoqun: "You are knowledgeable and experienced. As long as you give the order, our brothers can do whatever it takes.... Just say there are many people, we can divide into four or five groups and deal with it.... Or, "Eight Immortals cross the sea, each showing their own skills," let's all go our own way... What do you think, sir?"</p>
<p>"It's not okay for everyone to go their own way." Yaoqun rejected Laolong's proposal. "Isn't this a tricky problem?... Let me carefully consider it and discuss it with Fifth Master later..."</p>
<p>"Team leader, sir," Laolong saw that Yaoqun was in trouble and was pondering, so he made another suggestion: "Or, you can set off as you originally planned, with the deputy team leader. You only need to designate a location and set a date. You don't need to worry about how to get there. Our brothers will find a way... What do you think?"</p>
<p>"The location is Zhangbei or Zhangjiakou, and the date depends on which road we take. The faster the better, we can't fly..." Yaoqun said the word "fly," and his eyes lit up, as if he had an idea: "I think it's easy to get noticed if our team goes together; if we disperse, we're afraid we won't be able to take care of each other. But there is a way to go, it's just a bit harder - you and Wu Erye lead the brothers, dressed as coal mining workers as usual, first take the train to Jin County, then change the train to Lingyuan, where there are long-distance buses, first to Chengde, and then see how things go..."</p>
<p>"Okay, team leader, sir, we can't do other things, but we can walk. You can rest assured!" Laolong said to this point, and after a moment of pondering; "But each person's personal 'gear':"?</p>
<p>"Don't bring it, you can't get through even if you bring it, it's a pity to throw it away." Yaoqun said very decisively: "When we get to the location, I have a way."</p>
<p>"Okay..." Laolong breathed a sigh of relief: "In that case, please take care, sir, you don't need to worry about everything. Our team is sure to arrive at the location in five to seven days - let's say we decide on Zhangbei!" Laolong seemed very confident.</p>
<p>Yaoqun listened to Laolong's words, although he wasn't sure what he was up to, but when he recalled his usual resourcefulness and credibility, he readily accepted his request:</p>
<p>"But tonight I have to set off with Tiger. You have to trouble you with everything else. If no special accidents occur, I will definitely arrive in Zhangbei on the seventh or eighth of next month... The secret code is still the same as the ones used here. Regarding the road and food, I have already discussed it with Fifth Master. You can plan a little more generously and give Fifth Master a list of numbers, that's fine. We can rather overestimate and use sparingly..."</p>

<p>Free Talk The Red Spy Network by Thomas M. Johnson, translated by Wang Qijie</p>
<p>The world's largest spy network is spreading across the United States, and that is the Soviet spy network. They are using various methods to steal military and political information, scientific inventions, and anything else that is beneficial to Russia.</p>
<p>The United States has also been forced to adopt counter-espionage organizations. Recently, three people were actually murdered by Russians. Russian spies in the United States are mostly aided by the American Communist Party and Russian-controlled countries in the United States, such as Czech, Hungary, Austria, South, Bulgaria, and other overseas Chinese. While the Great War was in progress, Russia had already used the group to form a detective agency. It sent industrial and military delegations to the United States, about three thousand three hundred people, including many experts. They pretended to be lower-level staff to cover up and visit factories, test sites, and bases everywhere. On the one hand, they stole the secrets of the atomic bomb, and on the other hand, they said that we should not keep the atomic bomb secret.</p>
<p>Every spy has received high-level training and has knowledge of the army, navy, air force, industry, and diplomacy. The famous NKVD (Russian Secret Service) - now renamed MRVD - has expanded its organization in the United States, and there are cells everywhere. During the war, this type of unit had about ten locations in Canada, and in the United States, I am afraid there were no fewer than fifty. Detroit, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York all have more than one location each, and Washington may have ten.</p>
<p>Statistics from March of this year show that Russia has 3,696 employees working in the United States, and another 143 working at the United Nations. However, the United States has only 210 representatives in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The head of the spy network is often changed, one to confuse outsiders, and the other to allow a majority of spies to understand the situation in the United States. Some have the qualifications of Soviet representatives, while others forge passports and use false names. Some people were even taken by the Russian government from German prisoners of war and forced to become spies. These people can speak several languages and have lived in the United States, so they are often successful.</p>
<p>This work in the Communist Party is guided by: C.L. Reps" (Communist International Representatives). Among them are conspirators of various races, using various aliases. Their words are like holy edicts to the American Communists. Every official spy has at least ten people working with him, like the regular army doing guerrilla warfare, waiting for important tasks to go on assignments. They are often officials in the government using false names.</p>
<p>In addition to the regular spy network, there are also those who carry out special missions, such as assassinations, kidnappings, etc. Their leader is the Soviet Union's Minister of Internal Affairs, Beria. Beria is one of the members of the Politburo and maintains regular personal contact with Stalin. He can meet with Shi alone.</p>
<p>There are still many unsolved cases in the United States, and they are probably all related to these questions. For example, the assassination of Trotsky in Mexico City (Trotsky had retired here since he turned against Stalin); the disappearance of American Communist Party leader Poyntz in a New York hotel; the murder of New York anti-communist journalist Teasca; the suicide of Krivisky, etc., and the rain never stops!</p>
<p>Recently, the focus of their activities is to steal the secrets of the atomic bomb. They tried to infiltrate New York. The American counter-espionage agency, the FBI, has discovered documents stolen by them in a New York hotel. These spies ran away. In addition to the atomic bomb, the secrets of the B36 flying fortress are also one of their goals. It is said that this type of aircraft can carry atomic bombs to any place in the world, as well as Arctic combat plans, plans to expand the Panama Canal, etc., all of which are being spied on. It is said that one person has infiltrated a test site in Virginia, but was later discovered because of inconsistent credentials.</p>
<p>The British and American embassies in Moscow are often spied on by them. Next to the desk where the American embassy sends secret telegrams, a Russian wireless eavesdropping device was found behind the wall. Six of the newest microphones were found in the British embassy, ​​but fortunately, no secrets were leaked. The telephones of American embassies and consulates in Russia and its affiliated countries are often eavesdropped on. People from these affiliated countries rely on treaty relationships with the United States and often travel to various parts of the United States, indirectly aiding espionage. Recently, Poland sent a delegation of twenty-one envoys to the United States to discuss the relief of the famine in Poland. We treated them with great hospitality. Unexpectedly, these people spied everywhere and provided many military and industrial secrets to Russia, which is really outrageous. There are also those who do business, who are often the incarnations of spies. For example, Amotorg Trade Corporation has published a commercial guide that details the United States' transportation routes, bridge dangers, factories, and mines, and includes photos. It is very likely to be a guide for future combat bombings. The United States Patent Office guards the patents on inventions with ancient laws. You can buy an explanation of an invention for just two dimes and five cents, and the Russians specialize in buying news from here.</p>
<p>After Marshall took office, in order to prevent leaks, he purged the employees of the State Department, dismissing some and prosecuting others. Each embassy and consulate also sent an expert to be responsible for defense. The counter-espionage organization has also been expanded. However, there are many communists among the American sailors, and they often bring Russians in for secret investigations, suffering no small losses. In short, the American democratic law does not have provisions to prevent them, so many people have recently advocated for amending the law.</p>
<p>Quickly Suppressing Rumors by Cang Kangshi</p>
<p>Where does the wind of rumors come from?</p>
<p>Digging roots and beating flowers, sinister atmosphere;</p>
<p>Pitiful ignorant fools,</p>
<p>Why disturb and confuse yourself!</p>
<p>Recently, in the vicinity of the suburbs and around the laboring community, rumors have been spreading. There are words like "flower snatching gangs" and "eye digging gangs" appearing, which have resulted in several murder cases due to overreaction, and the disturbance caused by the beating of "eye digging gangs" the other day (see this newspaper on the 28th).

<h3>How to Handle Goods Piled Up in Customs Warehouses - The Export Control Committee is Requesting Instructions</h3>
<p>Regarding the previous report that customs authorities would purchase goods stored in customs warehouses without completed import procedures at official prices after the implementation of the new foreign exchange measures, import businesses stated that the goods piled up in customs warehouses were not prohibited items, but were ordered with black market drafts without completing the permit procedures. Furthermore, some of them had also held permits. Those that have been stored for a longer period have reached two or three months, and merchants have already suffered considerable losses, and they urgently hope that the government will have an appropriate handling method. After consultation with relevant agencies such as the Export Control Committee, they have requested instructions from higher authorities, and it is expected that they will be approved and announced in the coming days. As for rumors of official price purchases, merchants would hardly accept such a significant loss, and customs authorities would certainly not implement it without authorization to maintain the government's credibility.</p>
<p>Gold Prices Rise</p>
<p>This week, the price of metal goods has risen by about 10% compared to before. Iron nails have gradually increased, among which American leather belt buckles are the best, rising by about 30% in two weeks.</p>
<p>Ch'ien-p'ieh (a type of cloth). Recently, a batch has been shipped from India, with 500 boxes, totaling 15,000 p'ieh.</p>
<h3>Activities of Exporting Green Tea</h3>
<p>Various types of export green tea, which are most favored by Morocco, have been actively promoted to foreign countries by export merchants in this city since last week. Currently, part of it is needed by Morocco, causing the quiet foreign tea market to be revived yesterday and gradually become active. Moreover, this year's local Chen Mei and Lu Zhuang Yuan Xin Da Bang, which have been on the market for quite some time, have both opened for trading. It is estimated that the former was purchased by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. at more than 600 boxes, priced at 1.4 million yuan per dan (a unit of weight), while the latter was offered by Wing Hing Co., priced at 1.7 million yuan per dan. The market sentiment is still considered stable, and there are only minor changes in other areas.</p>
<p>It is learned that Wuchang and China Tea companies are currently in consultation with cargo owners. As for this year's Qimen black tea, although foreign countries also covet it, the high price makes it less lively, and transactions are still sparse. Only Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. has searched for 33 boxes of particularly high-quality tea, priced at 3 million yuan per dan. For other domestic sales of various patterns, this street and guest groups continue to sell mediocrely, and the market still lacks significant changes.</p>
<h3>Plain Thick Woolen Cloth is Firm and Brisk</h3>
<p>The market sentiment for plain thick woolen cloth is quite brisk these days, because the overall inventory in Shanghai is lacking, and various firms in the industry have very little stock. There are no shipments from Hong Kong and Japan, and this factory has no ability to weave it, resulting in limited stock that cannot meet demand. The market continues to prosper, and the trend is much firmer than other types of woolen cloth. Yesterday, thin plain woolen cloth was quoted at 400,000 yuan per yard, thick plain woolen cloth at 500,000 yuan, and yellow-edged plain thick woolen cloth traded at 550,000-600,000 yuan. The market prices of other woolen cloth, such as serge and melton, have risen due to the exchange rate of the US dollar and the imported wool being calculated at market prices.</p>
<h3>After the Restriction on the Import of Cottonwood, the Production of Match Splints Decreases</h3>
<p>The splint wood required by China's match industry has been mainly imported cottonwood from the United States. Since the authorities have controlled foreign exchange, imports have decreased, resulting in an extreme shortage of cottonwood raw materials. Various splint factories have had to temporarily use domestically produced poplar as a substitute. However, domestic poplar is loose and brittle, and the finished splints are easily broken and scattered. Therefore, in addition to using domestic poplar to manufacture splints for the needs of various match factories as a temporary measure, the splint factories have also requested the association to apply to the authorities for foreign exchange for importing wood.</p>
