<h3>和平問題審查意見參會今日提出討論　大會選駐委後即晚閉幕</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕和平提案之審査工作，於一日下午十一時完成，特種審査委會卅一日晚首次會議，初步決定草擬審査意見之原則，並推定草擬審査意見決議文之人員，該項起草委會，於一日晨集會，作愼重之討論，並加列具言後，於下午八時特種審委會二次會中提出討論，胡健中任主席，作詳盡之討論後，至下午十一時許始　致結論散會。會中諸氏發言極多，討論熟烈，韓甫鶚曾提出有關學潮，報紙諸問題，惟遭否決，結果照起草委會之草案略作文字修正，即行通過，定二日交大會討論。</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕參政會特種審査委會一日晚決定之對於和平問題各提案之審査意見，全文如次：</p>
<p>同人等聆悉國民政府蔣主席五月廿日在本會開幕時致詞，謂「以百折不懈之決心，求和平統一之實現」。又聆行政院張院長在本會所作之政治報吿，亦重申「關於中共問題，政府矢意和平，不惜委曲求全，儘量容忍，迄今不變政治解決之初衷」各節，不勝佩慰，同時本會同人所提有關和平問題提案廿件，方式雖不盡同，而其洞察全國人民之痛苦與蘄求和平統一之心理，則語重心長，殊無二致。本會爲全國最高民意機關，自應以全國人民之呼籲爲呼籲，盡本會一貫之努力，代表全國人民，向政府及中共貢獻和平之方策，祇須共循和平之途徑，爲誠意之商談，自不難突破當前之難關。吾人應體民衆苦戰望治之心理，而作切合需求，立決立行之籲請。爰循本會同仁各提案之　義，綜括爲左列各點，期其迅速實現，（一）請政府再度宣示中外，繼續貫澈「以政治方式解決中共問題」之方針。（二）請中共迅派代表來京，與政府雙方無條件恢復和談，本「政治民主化，軍隊國家化」之原則，積極硏討，迅速實仃。（三）本次大會閉幕後，由本會主席團及駐會委員會本此次大會決議之精神，繼續爲策進和平之努力。</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕參政會第四屆第三次大會，定二日下午舉行閉幕式，此次大會提案至一日下午止已通過將近四百件，所餘不及百件，預定二日上下午大會討論完畢。特種審委會制訂之和平方案，亦將於二日上午會議中提出，下午舉行大會後，賡續舉行閉幕式，主持閉幕式之主席，已擬定爲吳貽芳。</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕全體參政員，定三日晨謁國父陵。參政員聯誼會定二日在　大會堂聚餐聯歡。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕參政會二日上下午續開大會，討論提案，並選舉駐會委員，下午會畢，即行閉幕，不叧舉行閉幕式。</p>
<h3>軍警進駐旅大問題　中蘇繼續恊商中　王外長答覆參政員質詢</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕參政會廿二日外交報吿時，王維新·汪漁洋等參政員，曾就接收旅大及大連出海權等問題提出質詢，王外長一日提出書面答覆，略稱：「外部於過去一年中努力求取中蘇雙方對友好同盟條約之嚴格履行，蘇方對於戰時進入東九省之蘇軍，已宣吿於去年五月全部撤退，我對於接收旅順·大連兩地，近兩月來已一再與蘇方磋商，蘇方已表示願協助我接收工作，但對於我軍警進入旅大問題彼此意見尙未完全一致。現我決定一面先派視察團乘軍艦即往大連視察，一面就彼此意見尙未一致之點與蘇聯政府繼續磋商，以求於最近期間獲得解決。至於所詢中共利用大連取得軍火供應一節，政府曾嚴密注意，並調查如獲確證，自應採取必要之步驟」。</p>
<h3>旅大視察團今由瀋出發</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽一日電〕旅大視察團　　　一行十人，率隨員等定二日由瀋乘車南下赴某港，轉登我軍艦前往旅大。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨晤王正廷氏，詢以對參政會中有提議修改中蘇條約者，有何意見，氏不肯作正面答覆，僅謂此類重大問題，宜作冷靜之思考，否則將增加當局者之困難。</p>
<h3>工業設備被拆走我繼續搜集資料</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕王外長一日對參政會提出之書面答復中，涉及蘇聯搬運東北工廠設備問題，此案爲參員王國源·梁上棟所提出，據答：「關於蘇軍在駐留東北期間搬運工廠機器設備，本部已一再向蘇方申明我之嚴正立塲，對蘇方認爲東北一部份日人工業作爲蘇軍戰利品之見解，以其超過國際公法及國際習慣所公認之範圍，故已一再表示不能同意。英·美各國亦贊同我之立塲，現正與主管及各有關機關取得聯繫，進行調査，搜集各種資料，以爲繼續交涉之根據」。</p>
<h3>美軍治外法權案經表决予以保留</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕參會一日午後討論有關司法行政提案時，陳耀東所提「在華美軍人員應服從中國法律，擬請國府明令廢止「處理在華美軍人員刑事案件條例」以重國家主權案」，曾引起一塲激辯。陳氏說明此案時，指出我政府在對日抗戰期間，爲便利共同作戰起見，曾於卅二年十月訂有「處理在華美軍人員刑事案件條例」一種，其有效期間並經訂明至共同作戰結束後滿六個月爲止，嗣國府於去歲三月三日又明令延長一年。在此一年中，美軍人員侵害中國人民之刑事案件，不一而足，而美軍法庭竟不顧中國輿論與忿怒，竟爾宣吿被吿無罪案，外國人在所在國犯罪應受該所在國法律之制裁，爲國際法重大之原則，在兩國共同作戰期間，適甩該條例原爲不得已之權宜措施，茲距作戰結束之期已甚久遠，而該條例仍照常適用，不但侵害我主權，在國際法上亦開一惡例；故該項條例亟應予以明令廢止。渠並說明其辦法爲：請國府對處理在華美軍人員刑事案件條例，即日明令廢止，並照會美政府轉知該國在華人員，應即服從中國法律。</p>
<p>召集人江一平就法律觀點反駁，指出根據國際公法，軍隊駐紥外國，應享治外法權，譬如我國將來駐軍日本，亦將享受此種特權。此事關係重大，應以保留爲宜，他人亦有起立發言者，最後表決，照審査意見，該案保留。</p>
<h3>管制商業銀行參會昨曾討論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕政府對商業銀行管制尺度應否寬放，　仍取嚴格政策，亦爲一日午後參會辯論議題之一。會中主張對商業銀行應嚴加管制者，爲陳賡雅，吳望伋等人，陳氏認財部於抗戰期間所核准之商業銀行，錢莊多如雨後春筍，各設分支機構，其中資金短絀者專賴吸收大量存款，轉入投機市塲，以營非法業務，到處搜搶物資，刺激物價，囤積居奇，壟斷市塲。若不加管制，其危險不堪設想，吳望伋亦認商業銀行爲官僚資本大本營，應嚴加管制，亦未始非扶植正當銀行業之一法。持相反意見者，爲王冠英等，王認因抗戰停業之銀行錢莊應准復業，王德　亦建讓財部對省銀行及商業銀行應放寬尺度，允其在各地設立機構，以期發展各地經濟金融。討論時因審査意見有互相矛盾處，引起羅衡質問，咸盼會中對商行管制問題能有一貫主張，並應與參會過去一向所主張之緊縮政策相吻合，決議有關商行管制案五件，再付第四審査會審査。該會定一日晚開會，審査結果可望於二日大會提出。</p>
<h3>國民憲政社發表對當前國是意見</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕國民憲政社爲國大代表所組織之團體，分社遍全國各地，會員達數萬人，頃鑒於時局之嚴重，首次發表「對當前國是之意見」，首述國人及政府對和平之渴望與需要。該文檢討戰爭責任時稱，過去談判經過，政府均於每次和談失敗後猶作最後努力，並希望派張治中親赴延安試圖打開最後僵局，至今政府仍屢次聲明以政治方式解決問題，反之中共則仍堅持其所提出之兩條件，究竟何者關閉談判之門，甚爲明顯。其次就事實言，中共佔領區正在繼續無限制擴軍，預備進行長久大規模內戰，吾人只能在政府轄區製造和平空氣，喊出反對征兵征糧反內戰口號，但誰人曾聞及中共區有曾反對其行爲者乎？誰不須和平？誰在堅決進行內戰乎？中共的終極目的，是企圖以長期內戰，將政府拖垮，與中共言和，實等於與虎謀皮，中國內戰有其國際背景，此事中共周恩來曾公開坦白承認。過去中共在東北並無武力，目前不惟有，且每次潰敗之餘，仍能繼續發動大規模攻勢。目前正在山東進行劇烈戰事，軍火補給從何得到，且蒙古韓國人亦在東北共軍中參戰，明瞭此諸種事實，即可了解今日中國內戰之眞象。該文末稱，如吾人之認識爲正確的，今日問題已非國內問題，問題中心亦非戰爭與和平問題，而爲要祖國與不要祖國問題，吾人認爲解決內戰固須從改善革新內政做起，但主要關鍵還須從外交　手，始爲針對現實之正確途徑，所謂和談云云，實爲緣木求魚，吾承認天眞純潔靑年，出此呼聲，係出於愛國家愛人民的心理，若成年人而有政治頭腦者，尤作如此主張，若非愚蠶即係另有作用。吾人以此自信，並願以此就敎國人，吾人希望全國　正愛國家愛人民人士，急起直追，以嚴督政治之改善，糾正外交政策之錯誤。</p>
<h3>漢奸赦免問題　參政會中有熱烈辯論最後表决原提案保留</h3>
<p>〔本報甫京一日電〕漢奸赦免問題，參政會一日午後開會時，曾引起熱烈辯論，江一平，燕樹某，章士釗等法學專家引經據點各逞雄辯，國大會堂幾成高院法庭，亦此次大會一大佳話。此一激辯，係由於張邦珍抨擊章士釗提案所起，章氏提案請政府擴大大赦範圍，凡犯罪在民卅五年底以前，除殺死直系血親等親屬曁戰罪犯外，槪依大赦令甲、丙兩項分別辦理，以昭寬典，而啓新機。張邦珍認漢奸若亦在大赦之列，豈非鼓勵後輩盡做漢奸，大大使不得而審査意見竟謂其「用意至善」，實屬匪夷所思，召集人江一平說明稱：原提案之意，在使淪陷區被迫附逆人民能援情酌减，蓋彼輩大都係不得已落水之小蒼蠅，今被囚者幾達百萬人，而大奸巨熟，反能逍遙法外，三次大戰發生，豈非鼓勵人人爲大漢奸，張邦珍反質審査會召集人咸爲大律師，是否爲漢奸辯護，趙澍，伍純武等亦起立發言，主張政府對周佛海，丁默邨等巨奸應予嚴辦，最後公請原提案人章士　說明，全塲以一種聽好戲心情，聆此一代法學家滔滔陳詞。章氏以悲天憫人口吻指出，據統計，全國有漢奸嫌疑者不下百萬人，其　女至少達二百萬人，漢奸後裔亦爲大中華民國國民，且多從事愛國工作者，徒因父兄不肖，致無面目以見世人，吾人若盡置不齒之列，是不特影響歷史，且影響民族前途，即就一般小漢奸而論，當時因不及隨政府西遷，而流落陷區之同胞，達二億人，少數附逆，亦係被迫出此，政府地下工作，有賴於彼等之處頗多，一律不予赦免，實不公道，且不合理，故有此案提出，章說畢，張邦珍等仍不以爲然，最後表决，原提案保留。</p>
<h3>參會第十六次會通過　組織台灣慰問團　東北視察團三週內出發</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕參政會一日上午第十六次會議中，曾通過由參政會組台灣攷察慰問團及東北視察團兩案，交駐會委會迅速辦理，其辦法如次：甲·台灣攷察慰問團，（一）由本會推選參員若干人，組織之。（二）經費及交通工具，由政府供應。（三）組織及工作綱領，經費預算等，另定之。乙·東北視察國，（一）由大會推舉七人至十一人組織之。（二）團員人選，三分之二由非東北籍參政員中推選。（三）不得邀請政府官吏參加本團。（四）限大會閉慕後三星期內出發，兩月內完成視察報吿，交駐會委會轉送政府督促施行。（五）凡在東北之政府機構，無論屬於中央及地方，皆爲視察之對象。（六）凡制度，人事，政策，行政皆爲應加視察之內容。（七）在視察中如發現官吏有失職凟職及觸犯刑章者，本團應及時加以必要之措置，或向有關機關加以檢舉。（八）本團經費應由本會擬具專案，請政府籌撥。（九）本團對本會負責等項。</p>
<h3>孔庚幽默提案　請醫中國目前三大病決議送政府切實注意</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕孔庚之提案標題爲「請速醫治中國目前三大病症，以挽救國家危機案」，其所謂三大病症爲「民主病，經濟病，軍事病三者，萬一爲本病，後二爲標病，本病須用治本之法，標病須用治標之策，治本至少十年，治標至少三月，且謂民主文化知識不足，其病在愚，民主經濟能力不足，其病在窮，民主知識能力不足，各黨遂認政黨即是民主，其病在太阿倒持。全文極盡幽默感，討論結果，送政府切實注意。</p>

<h3>禁止營業跳舞提案送請政府參酌辦理</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕張之江等所提「請政府通令各省市嚴禁男女交際舞營業，以端風尙，而正習俗一案，已於一日上午第十六次會中通過，送請政府參酌辦理，該案討論之熱烈，爲今晨大會中惟一揷曲。該案原提案人張之江，前在三中全會時亦曾提出「禁舞」之提案，遇遭否決，今再向參會提出。審査會研討結果，認爲循社會進步及靑年交際超於正軌，該案無建議政府之必要，故提出意見爲「保留」，惟一日在大會提出後，張之江兩次發言，說明禁止營業性交際舞之重要，旋復有多人發言，討論達一刻鐘之久，一時會塲空氣趨於熱烈緊張。該案主要意見在說明西洋風俗不同，西洋跳舞，絕不合我國情，其中極盡闡塲，我國古代禮樂之能事，認爲「西洋跳舞在我國實行以來，確係助畏淫風，不獨糜費金錢，抑且廉恥斵喪，傷風敗俗，流弊百出」，「男女交際舞之事，在人道方面言，應當絕對禁止，蓋男女交際舞者，非僅受授而親，且增加其纏綿摩擦，匪特撤除杜漸防微，竟然大開方便之門，極恣情縱慾之能事」。張氏提出說明時，即大聲呼喚男女授受不親之古訓，說明舞時摩擦問題。繼之廖學章亦發言，說明其中有「大家在跳舞塲談戀愛」，繪影繪聲，博得鬨堂大笑，旋雖經召集人方少雲，說明審査經過及意見，但會塲中意見顯已分爲兩派，一主保留者，在崇尙西洋文明，一主請政府參酌辦理者，在回溯歷史，表揚我國固有禮樂。終付表決，第一次以在塲人數一八二名，主送政府參辦者獲票九〇，應以少數計否決，但終以多數人認爲點數不周，報吿不靈，要求重付表決，結果以六十九票之少數贊同保留，終以修正案通過，送請政府參酌辦理，一塲風彼，一幕揷曲，於焉結束。</p>

<p>昨日參政會大會，多數通過江庸等八十人所提「請政府迅速展開經濟復興工作，並迅向美國磋商借款，以供建設之用案，」決議該案送請政府迅速辦理。又爲使借款專供建設之用而不致流爲官僚資本計，經大會決議，他日借款成立後，由民意機關監督其用途，美國自杜魯門主義頒布以來，希土等國，旣先後獲得美國經濟的奧援；卽在軍事統治下的朝鮮，亦有獲得貸款以謀其經濟復興的諾言，我國爲此次世界第二次大戰的前衛，歷時旣久，損害尤重，美政府雖曾指撥五億元助我國的經濟復興，迄今仍未動用。今茲參政會集會於首都，以多數通過此一提案，實足以反映一般人民的意向，就是，爲了我國經濟建設的繁重。我政府應卽向美國商洽動用這五億美元的貸款。所謂五億美元貸款，在去年四月間，美國進出口銀行已經儲款以待。而時逾一年，尚未實現，今距六月底的限期，已迫在眉睫，因此，站在人民的立塲，我們不能不有所表示。</p>
<p>就我國方面說：行政院張院長於就城之初，雖曾闡朋立塲，重在自力更生，不願倚賴外債，以彌補預算上之超支，但亦同時表示，我國現有廣大之區域需要立卽開始經濟複員與建設工作，此種工作所需之費用，自非我國庫現時能力所能負荷。於此，則美國之借款，自關至要。因此國外電訊，屢傳借款計劃，已經向美國提出之說。美國方面，國務卿馬歇爾自莫斯科歸國後亦曾宣稱：中國希望動用美國五億貸款中一部份，已提出數種方案。最近並傳馬卿現正敦促早日以美國進出口銀行若干借款，貸予中國，以應其復興工作之緊急需要。同時並屢傳，六月底的限期，可能重予延長。從以上這些迹象來推測，可知這種借款，兩面都有意促成：縱使本月底以前，或以手續關係未必能全部完成，但最後的結果固不難推斷。</p>
<p>這理由是狠簡單的。經濟並無國界，世界上任何部分的衰落都不免要牽累到其餘部分。以我國人口之衆，市塲之大，而際此長期抗戰之後，瘡痍徧地，購買力極度低落，如果不用賒貸或借款等方式來予以充分的濟助，那末，任何國家，要想推廣其出口，以促進兩國問的貿易，從而宣洩其高度的工業生產，和維持其就業的美滿狀况，事實上確屬難能。現在戰後各國，其經濟上殘破的程度，大都遠不及我國，然而美一元的缺乏，和購買力的薄弱，已覺百孔千瘡，無以維持其國際的均衡，何况八年抗戰，公私交困如我國呢？</p>
<p>勝利以來，每月海關統計，已沒有一月不明確表示，我國進出口數字最大的一國爲美國，原來對華貿易的優勢，美國早已取英日而代之了。而現在國力較裕，可以餘剩的資金或物資來貸與我國的，無疑地又祇有美國。所以五億貸款，在六月底以前，卽使未及實現，也不能不酌予展長，以待時機之成熟。這種關係，與其說是中國片面的，母寗說是中美互利的。凡是目光較遠，謀國較深的，都能見到這一層。所以今天美國貸款之所以口惠而實不至者，其故不在美國而在中國。這是值得我們深切反省的。</p>
<p>今日所成爲問題的，在美方爲條件問題，卽所稱借款計劃，在我國則爲用途問題，卽如何防止浪費與貪污。現在參政會已指定用途爲迅速展開經濟復興工作，專供建設之用，同時並議決由民意機關監督用途，關於浪費與食污的顧慮，至少當可望有阻止的具體辦法。這與美方所要求的計劃一項，或亦不無裨益。因爲用途是否正當，開支有無浮濫，以及將來經手使用貸款的人是否貪污，當然都是債權人所最注意的要點。要點解決，其餘自可迎刃而解。</p>
<p>我們淤此，不憚訊費，還要喚起大家注意的，就是：政府執行政策的能力與效率問題。因爲經濟建設與復興工作，其詞甚泛。兵焚以後，百廢待舉，我們却希望分別緩急，務從民生切要的項目做起。其大而無當，裝點門面，或剩餘物品意在宣洩的供應，應力求避免，以免增加不必要的負担。至於現在經濟上最迫切的問題，也是最主要的問題，無過於穩定幣值。幣值不穩定，則物價便不能穩定，從而工資，利率，外匯，生產，進出口，人民生活，乃至國家財政，社會秩序等，也幾乎無從穩定。這筆借款中是否包括外匯基金在內？如果包括在內，其成分究占多少？這尤其是值得十分注意的。不過，此項借款旣以復興建設爲其主要用途，我們縱不能說它不具有財政上的意義，然而顧名思義，究當以復興我國民族經濟爲主要目的。但無論其性價如何，其主要關鍵還是在我政府執行政策之有定見與有毅力。假使政府對於某種政策，或猶豫不決，或舉棋不定，朝以爲是暮以爲非，今日往東，明日往西，不但將使人民無所適從，漸生藐視政令的習性，卽國際友邦亦將感到吾政府之徬徨歧路，手足無措，何能望其貸我鉅款？須知戰後的經濟建設已非易事，何况在一個一面有共黨破壞，一面有多黨牽制的局面之下，自然難上加難。</p>
<p>最後，我們在檢討向美國借款的時候，總以爲在美國方面應該知道「及時的醫藥方可治病救人」的道理，而在我國方面，則應該痛自反省，惟强有力而富有效率的政府方可獲友邦的充分信任。</p>

<h3>日三黨內閣昨正式成立　片山發表施政方針　外相蘆田均呼籲國際恊助</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京一日電〕片山內閣之閣僚人選已於三十一日夜七時二十分由組閣本部發表，即在交涉中者亦皆承諾入閣，於一日午前九時三十分，齊集首相官邸，十時十分　宮，十一時於片山首相侍立之下，舉行日皇之認證式。（按日本新憲法實行後，日　對新內閣閣僚已不舉行親任式，而改行認證式，因據新憲法第六條及第七條之規定，日皇僅有權根據國會之指名任命首相，至於閣僚則由首相任命後，日皇僅作形式上之認證而已。）片山首相向各大臣遞交官印，於茲，片山內閣遂正式成立。又蘆田外務大臣兼任中央聯絡事務局長宮，和田國務大臣兼任經濟安定本部長官及物價廳長官，亦已發表。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京一日電〕片山內閣一日下午一時在首相官邸舉行首次全體閣僚會議，決定於二日發表非常時經濟危機突破對策施行方針。下午二時會議完畢後，片山首相及閣僚即與記者團會見，各發表如次之施政方針。</p>
<p>片山首相稱。所謂民主政治，並非形式上之人類解放，而必須伴有經濟上之解放；目前日本最主要者，當爲克服食糧危機。本人認爲：掌握政權者，係代表國民而擔當行政上之重任，並非成爲特權階級。至於經濟革命，即在法國復興時期，亦已實行。余擬努力使我國（日本）邁進於文化國家之建設。余原擬組織各黨聯介內閣，並經多日之奮鬥，但結局仍爲三黨聯合內閣，而自由黨則謂在閣外協力。惟雖謂係三黨聯合，其實目前之內閣並非全然三黨之雜然混合，而係成爲一個整體，並將恊力以突破目前危機。</p>
<p>田外相稱：爲安定目前國民生活，則經濟之再建，殊爲重要。日本人確極遵守波茨坦宣言，以謀國際地位之向上，若不獲得諸外國之好意援助，則決不能復興。日本人今後必需爲愛好和平之國民，爲放棄戰爭之文化國家之人民，而使各國予以信賴。</p>
<p>矢野藏相稱：關於今後日本財政政策，將着重如下數事：（一）新日圓凍結不予考慮，亦不考慮停止支付公債利息。（二）實行必要之金融統制政策：自三月實施緊縮貸款政策以來，重要產業亦陷入資金困難狀態。現所實行之低物價政策，國民購買力不足亦爲其原因之一，因之吾人不能不對通貨收縮傾向予以考慮，總之，對於重要產業之貸款規定，將再緩和，以提高生產。（三）防止通貨膨漲；對因通貨膨漲及黑市而獲得之不當利得，將征以重稅，但並未對此考慮新稅。（四）政策協定中對物價與工資，將予堅强之統制，關於工資方面，希望勞資雙方，舉行經營協議會，以此爲　礎而提高生產。</p>
<p>水谷商相稱：日本爲欲克服經濟危機，曾進行過分之通貨及金融對策，而遲緩生產之復興。余則認爲生產復興，最爲重要，預定對於重要產業如石炭，肥料，電力，船舶，將來由國家管理。第一爲石炭產業之國營而整理礦區，又賠償相信係以設備而非以製品充之。　平野晨相稱：余前曾希望配給食糧三合（每日每人），但自余接任大臣後，覺此舉不能即時實行，惟糧食問題擬努力求其解決，余將組糧食調節委員會，使易於獲得糧食，並創設肥料國營委員會，而希望將來實施肥料之管理。</p>
<h3>日新內閣對共產主義擬實行堅壁清野政策</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京一日電〕片山總理今日向日本記者團宣稱，新政府將表裏一致，不尙虛僞。關於具體政策，須與各閣員協商後始能決定，暫無可言。惟事前外務省曾用片山名義發表聲明，謂新內閣對共產主義擬實行堅壁淸野政策。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京一日電〕日首相片山本日否認渠有共產黨背景，並發表正式聲明，保證新內閣將採取不左不右之中庸路綫。片山之言有謂：「根據日本新憲法之精神，余今日已組成新閣。吾人不能獲得自由黨之參加內閣，余以至誠表示遺憾。新閣根據五月十六日四然（自由黨在內）所協議之政策，此後當採取中庸路綫，旣不左傾，亦不右傾，尤其明白反對共產主義。因此，希望自由黨在此方面與政府合作。余深信在日本人民一致合作及各盟國善意協助下，日本必能克服一切困難。」</p>
<h3>日增設勞動省</h3>
<p>惟尙須待本屆國會通過</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京一日電〕片山新內閣中發表國務大臣兼勞動大臣一席，然勞動省之設立尙僅爲社會黨之一計劃案而已。據新國務大臣米窪滿亮稱：關於增設勞動省問題，已與厚生大臣一松定吉氏交換意見，關於成立勞動省之一切準備工作，亦均完全交由厚生省負責，將來厚生省一部份業務，即移交勞動省管理，惟尙有待於本屆國會之通過，始有合法之根據。</p>
<h3>麥帥報告　琉球選舉延期</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京一日電〕據麥帥今日發表其對琉球羣島軍事政府之第三次報吿稱：琉球之選舉業已延期，以待遣僑工作完成及返國人民重行定居後再行舉行。惟又稱：各島人民結合成一政治單位，業已大有進展，琉球羣島人民重行開墾其被損毁之土地，並在美國軍事政府監督之下，學習現代農業與工業之方法。麥帥佑計：琉球羣島祗能生產本年所需之食糧之一半，惟原科可獲得之地區，則工業恢復可獲滿意之進展。</p>

<h3>法西義三國共黨擬組織國際兵團　準備赴希臘恊助遊擊隊</h3>
<p>（合衆社羅馬卅一日電）今日來自巴黎方面之消息稱：一羣法，西，義三國之共產黨，其中包括西班牙內戰時代之著名將領密亞哈，在一月前於法國西南部召開會議，決定成立一國際兵團計劃，借道南斯拉夫前往希臘，參加遊擊隊對政府作戰。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社雅典卅一日電〕此間負責人士對於「國際軍團」可能在國外組織成立而對希臘作戰一曆表示惶恐。據官方最近發表戰報，希臘政府新採取之戰略，常因地而異，悉視軍事行動係在內地或邊界一帶發生而定，例如在帖撤利區，政府軍大半從事於包團並殲滅小規模之游擊隊隊伍，其人數至多不過五十名，此在色雷斯及馬奇頓等邊界一帶，則政府軍必須截斷游擊隊與若干外國間之交通綫，帖撤利，色雷斯及馬奇頓等地區之游擊隊常有「外國人」混雜其間，「國際重團」之組成將使局勢更趨紊亂，游擊隊之軍備日見進步，匪特擁有機關槍抑且亦有高射砲，尤使希臘政府感覺不安云。</p>

<h3>格林蘭航空基地美希望保留一處</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓卅一日電〕此間政界人士談稱：關於丹麥政府要求廢止一九四二年所訂格林　防務協定一事，美國現希望能得一妥協辦法，俾戰時在該地所建之航空基地，美國至少仍可繼續使用其中一處。丹麥政府今提出廢止之要求，已使美國海軍陷於困難地位中。故美國政府願與州麥進行談判，俾可仍獲繼續使用其中一處航空基地。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社德黑　卅一日電〕頃悉：伊朗駐蘇大使費洛茲親王，已於五月廿六日以照會一件送達蘇聯外長莫洛托夫，要求蘇聯償還業已過期之黄金債務。按此項俊務，蘇聯國家銀行本應於去年三月二日，將款項償還伊朗國家銀行，但蘇聯迄未履行。</p>

<h3>匈政變告一段落左翼黨控制大局　內閣改組舊員大都蟬聯</h3>
<p>〔合衆社匈京卅一日電〕匈少數黨共產黨，藉蘇聯援助，舉行政變控制政府，今日已吿完成。在上屆選舉中，獲得全國投票百分之十六之共黨，似已操縱一切。顯然新總理人選以及其閣員，係獲得蘇方同意。惟據此問消息靈通方面，認爲盛傳匈牙利將接受蘇聯訓練及裝備匈軍一項消息，實屬無稽云。</p>
<p>〔路透社匈京一日電〕狄奈將軍領導之匈牙利新內閣，已於昨夜宣誓就職。前外長蓋昂格奧西不復爲新閣之外交部長，外長一職將由情報部長米哈利斐菲暫時代理。宣誓禮曾因總統蒂爾第，共黨副總理賴柯錫。及副總理薩卡西資之討論應否使蒲洛夫神父蟬聯次長，而遲延半小時舉行。蒲洛夫神父固被視爲農民黨之最後防綫，最後始由三人決定，由內閣於星期一決定蒲洛夫神父之去留。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦卅一日電〕外交界人士相信改組後之匈牙利政府，並不致變更舊閣之基礎，而匈牙利之政治勢力，在理論上仍可保持平衡，惟料農民黨迫於共黨及社會民主黨之壓力，將不得不繼續肅淸黨內份子。前此已有不少農民黨右翼份子，因與陰謀傾覆共和國案而遭肅清，經再度肅清後，農民黨在國會中之多數恐將減少。同時左翼黨派預料將　緊要求提早普選，以增强其地　新閣名單如下：副總理　賴柯錫　（共黨）薩卡西資　（社會黨）國務　杜畢　（農民黨）內政　賴土克　（共黨）工業　班恩　（社會黨）交通　吉洛　（共黨）農業　巴拉尼沃斯　（農民黨）司法　里斯　（社會黨）社會福利　莫爾那　（共黨）供應　艾洛斯　（農民黨）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市工務局局長趙祖康，爲欲使市參議會明瞭該局內部管理等情形，特於前日邀請參會工務委員會代表唐世昌·陸蔭初·汪竹一·陳公達·韋雲靑等諸參議員赴該局叙談。趙局長即席報告絡稱：工務局之工作，在性質上可分基本與緊急二種。內部管理均採取科學化方法。至局中雇用之工人，包括公國警察，重夫等，現已裁减至五千四百餘人，其中三千餘人刻正散布於各區各處修築道路，因之人數缺少，對於大工程不得不採用包工辦法，例如天目路之拓寬工程等。工務局實施工作之政策，決以市參議會決議爲依據，但修路工作，困難萬分，八年失修，非但道路，破壞不堪，耶自來水管亦損壞，按上海地勢，自來水管應設在路面三尺以下，但過去大多裝於距路面二尺至三尺之間，故破壞更易。總之，本局工作雖未能達到最高標準，但決盡力去做。對於購買材料及機器等，均儘量向政府機關如中央信託局，行總等購辦，藉以求得低廉價格。</p>
<p>局長報告畢，陸蔭初。陳公達等參議員均起立表示趙局長來到　　，　　　了許多事，而非來做官。希望以後仍織續努力。唐參識員世昌則希望趙局長記住「　能盡如人意，但求無愧我心」，並建　局長可不必非按參議會議決案執行不可，不妨自己發動，相信根據局長過去成續，對其新設施必能信任。注竹一則顧慮到技術人員待遇問題，希望市參議會及社會人土召組一關於工務之機構，專助工務局解決購料經濟人事等問題。</p>

<h3>警員國家意識極高絕無受人煽動可能　俞副局長發表談話</h3>
<p>市警局俞副局長叔平，對，近傳有反動份子，利用學生罷謀期內，煽動本市警察，參加「六二」遊行示威運動事，發表談話如下：查本市警察由工部局留用者，約佔現有人數二分之一，服務年資多在一二十年以上，工作經騐豐富，服務興趣濃厚，其眷滿大都有副業，生活相當安定。至於新警皆係初中以上畢業，曾受嚴格訓絲，國家意識極高，且大都爲單身漢，負担較輕。以其來自鄕間，本質亦極純樸，其平時服務精神，亦堪嘉尚。故非但無煽動餘地，且將永遠爲上海精神堡壘，余可保證。俞氏又稱：本市長警待遇，亦經儘量設法提高，目前警員待遇，除基本數卅四萬元外，加成數一千八百倍，再加市府發給百分之十之調整津貼約二萬餘元。如以最低底薪五十五元計算，每月至少可得四十六萬元以上。至於長警待遇，除基本數廿三萬八千元外，加成數一千八百　，再加市府發給百分之廿之調整津貼約三萬餘元，即以長警最低級薪四十五元計算，至少亦可得三十一萬元以上。此外，長警另加食米五斗，折合市價，其待遇亦與警員相埓。且市長爲顧念長警生活困難起見，又另配給日用品多稀，故本市長警，際此市財政竭獗之時，能得如此待遇，較之國內各地，不可謂不優厚。况本局員警福利事業如警察醫院，子弟小學，及員警工友因公傷亡之互相救濟等，對於員警生活之補助甚多，故決不致有輕易妄動，而願作無謂之犧牲者。</p>

<h3>趙曾珏應邀播講　本市公用事業輪廓　昨本報第九次星期特別廣播</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報於昨日假座亞洲電台，舉辦第九次星期特別廣播，請公用局局長趙曾珏播講「本市公用事業的輪廓」。茲誌其演詞如下：「本市主管公用事業的機關是公用局，公用局自復原以來，對於本市公用事業的整理與發展，有四項原則，現在概述如次：（一）上海的地位，對外爲國際商港，對內爲工商中心，公用事業的設施，一當認識此種地位而配合其發展。（二）公用事業的設施，應有整個性和統一性，不可分割。某種公用事業雖不妨由幾個單位經營，但應當在一個統一的計劃之下經營，互相聯繫，互相配合。（三）公用事業過去雖在不合理狀態之下發展，但現在談合理化，並非另起爐灶之謂，而是用整理改良的方法，使原有事業納入正軌。（四）公用事業的經營能採取公營的企業方式，自然最合理想。但市庫財力有限，因此，凡經營著有成績的公用事業，或準備經營的公用事業，無論爲外商或爲華商，只要能俠照合理化，企業化，及民衆化的原則辦理，無不歡迎。其次，談談公用事業的槪况：（一）電力，上海爲工業中心，而電力爲工業之母，應有充分之供給。戰前上海各電廠總容量爲廿六萬瓩，依照戰前統計，預測今後五年內可能增加至四十一萬瓩，另加百分之十五的備機量，應爲四十七萬瓩。但經戰時損失，現在僅有十八萬瓩，至本年年底止可能增至二十萬瓩，但尚少二十七萬瓩。依照公用局的計劃，一面在保留各電廠個別營業的原狀下，使其在技術上發生聯繫，完成聯合高壓輸電網。一面發起組織聯合電氣公司，成立大發電廠。幷擬請中央指撥日本賠償電機，由聯合公司優先承購，以便利本市工業之發展。（二）給水，不僅在本市郊區尚缺乏給水的設備，即在市區以內，亦尚不能充分的給水。公用局的計劃：一面使各水廠在技術上儘可能的聯繫，將幹管接通，互相供給，一面預備在滬西另設新廠。現在本局已成立滬西自來水設計處，做籌備工作，同時另訂緊急工程計劃，（甲）開自流幷三座，至七月中可以完或。（乙）增築蓄水池，由法商區輸水轉售。（丙）令英商公司加長膠州路水站之注水時間，刻已通知英商公司辦理。（三）煤氣煤氣爲　價而淸潔之燃料，如倫敦紐約應用煤氣的用戶幾占全部戶口半數以上，而本市現在僅有二萬戶，所以煤氣在上海確有遠大的前途。現在英商煤氣公司及公用局吳淞煤氣廠，每日總產量不到五百萬立方呎。公用局的計劃：預備在南市成立新廠，假定容量爲每日五百萬立方呎，將來再將吳淞廠提高產量至每日二百萬立方呎，英商煤氣公司爲四百萬立方呎，幷使三個單位聯合供應，共計即可得一千萬立方呎。現在吳淞廠與英商公司業已實行聯合供應。（四）電話，電話爲本市的神經系統，惟經營本市電話者，一爲美商上海電話公司，一爲交通部電信局。以一地而有兩個鴛話機構，且所用話機又非同一制度，所以發生種種缺點。公用局的意見，認爲欲使上海電話制度合理化，在技術上須採用劃一制度，在經營上須採用統一組織。爲適應將來的發展，已根據目前工商業及人口分佈狀况，訂定分區及分期實施辦法，現正呈請中央核准中。（五）陸上交通，本市爲工業中心，同時又爲國際商港，所以市內交通，對外應與輪船碼頭，火車站，飛機塲相聯繫配合。對內應與工業區，商業區，住宅區，學校區相聯繫配合。本市戰前因市政機構鼎足而三，各區殊少互相連貫之交通幹綫，尤以南北爲甚。今市政旣告統一，所有縱橫交通幹綫應重行規劃。首使英商電車公司，法商電車公司，及公用局之公共交通公司籌備委員會，在技術上一致協調，同時盡力擴充公共交通公司。該公司現有公共汽車一六四輛，行駛十一綫。郊區長途汽車則招商承辦，現已開闢者共計八綫。（六）水上交通浦東與浦西，僅以一江之隔，而發展狀態大相懸殊。欲開發浦東，必先發展水上交通，公用局現已將自辦之輸渡，改組爲官商合辦之公司，竭力擴充輸渡設備，並開始進行卡車過江渡工程，約在本年秋季可以開航。</p>
<p>末了要說明的，公用局是公用事業的行政機關，職掌爲對於公用事業之設計，指導，監督，而其他水廠電廠等才是公用事業的業務機構，希望本市市民如對公用事業有意見者，儘量提出，本局當在可能範圍之內，力求公用事業的進步與合理化。」</p>
<h3>廣播節目精彩</h3>

<p>下午開始本年度會務討論，決定重要議案：（一）建議政府指撥專款，編製造船工程名詞。（二）籲請有關造船之工廠與航政航業機關盡量容納造船機系畢業生。（三）由理事會指聘專家組織技術研究委員會，擬具乾舷定律，騐船規則等，作我國出席在英舉行之國際水上安全會議之準備，並建議政府請派王世銓會員出席。（四）建議政府指撥專款，設置船模試騐池，以利研究。繼即改選本屆理監事，結果馬穗驥，王超，葉在馥，李允成，辛一心，王世銓，葉芳哲，陳藻藩，郭錫汾當選爲理事，歐德，張合法，徐祖善當選監事。是後宣讀論文四篇。會畢舉行聚餐餘興，至七時許始盡歡而散。</p>

<p>市長繼稱，政府調査名單，極爲審愼，爲避免若干份子造成罷工罷市，影響全市安　起見，不能不暫予隔離，同時對保釋一點，因恐情節較重者釋放後，傳訊無人負責，故亦不得不酌分經重，根據參議會之決議辦理，最爲合理。</p>
<p>談話至下午二時始散，敎授等當即表示彼等係前日始被選爲敎授會理事，敎授會尙未正式商討，故允於回校後召開敎授會，將談話經過報吿，並當力加解釋。</p>

<p>敎授會態度</p>
<p>敎授季文美報吿該校龍課至於罷敎演變之經過，略稱：旬日以來，交大敎授幾經努力勸導，方得恢復上課秩序，而卅日侵晨二時，大隊軍警忽來校逮捕學生，變出意外，不特學生情緒激昂，即同人等亦深感挽救無由，除特電呈政院敎部參政會呼籲外，當宣吿罷敎，以示抗議。季氏復申明該校敎授會態度：（一）對於學生罷課，一向極力勸阻；（二）學潮應予疏導，不可高壓學生；（三）軍警當局對於學潮措施辦法，應予改善。季氏並報吿卅一日晚各敎授在市長官邸與市長交換意見之結果，業經今（一）日由敎授會談話會決定：「本會建議各點，如政府同意，可以復課。」</p>
<p>吳市長意見</p>
<p>繼由敎授陳湖報吿吳市長昨日上午業經簽署答允該會所提供之六項意見：（一）由市政府及警備司令部會同在校門首佈吿，如學校情形安謐除十八人外（按當局以該校應捕之學生爲十八名，二人已逮捕，尙有十六人在逃），不再逮捕其他學生。（二）由市政府函知學校，今後未得校方事先同意，不派軍警便衣入校捕人。（三）逮捕學生，照市參議會六月一日在各報公佈辦法辦理，學校復課後，如尙未捕獲之十六人到校時，由校方陪同向市政府或警備司令部投到，視情節輕重，按照下列辦法辦理：（一）交學校負責管理；（二）由各家長或保證人領回；（三）如經校方及市政當局確認爲證據確實，依照市參議會通過之辦法辦理。（四）「五卅」事件兇手，由市政府及警備司令部負責嚴辦，但因時間匆促，俟至六月二日以後辦理。（五）受傷學生之醫藥費及學校損失，由參議會調査後，請市政府支給。（六）逮捕學生，校方得派敎授代表前往視察。上述各項，並由市參議會藩議長及該校校友會負責人趙曾珏等簽字爲見證人。敎授會對此表示滿意。</p>
<p>最後裘氏特別聲明：某日報及某晚報所載該校敎授鍾偉成鼓動學潮，及「五卅」事件中學生搶槍，報道失實，希望予以更正。並謂：據吳市長宣稱，被捕學生絕對優待，飲食方面，均較平時在校爲佳，並由衛生局派醫生檢查健康。吳市長昨（一）日並觀往視察被拘學生居住飲食狀况。記者招待會至五時許散會。</p>
<h3>各方疏導結果交大明日復課</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕交通大學敎授會，於昨日上午十時在該校舉行，到敎授六十餘人。敎育部督學陳東原，帮辦　大塤，市參議會代表李開第，及該校校友會負責人趙曾鈺等均被邀列席，討論疏導學潮問題，由敎授會主席裘維裕主持。首由前晚出席吳市長茶會之機械系敎授李泰雲報吿參加市長茶會之經過（見昨日本報）後，繼由陳東原氏致詞，說明朱部長接獲吳校長辭職及該校「五卅」發生不幸事件消息後，異常不安，特派渠與童大塤氏來滬慰問。陳氏繼說明敎育部對於該校上月所提各項要求，大部已經允諾，保證今後協助該校之發展。至於逮捕學生事件，陳氏稱：地方當局之措施或不無可批評之處，然當局爲免「六二」事件之發生，影饗全市市民生命財產之安全，實有其不得已之苦衷，故本敎育立塲言之，甚望敎授同仁協助平息學潮，平日復敎。校友會趙曾鈺，說明國家當前遭遇嚴重之困難，較戰時尤甚，深盼敎授以國家，學校，敎育爲前提，協助政府安定靑年。參議員李開第說明此次全國性之學潮，與以前學潮確有不同處，地方當局措施，可稱「用心良苦」，對於當前局勢應加以詳細思考及冷靜分析。嗣由教授多人相繼發表意見後，當決定該會提供之六項建議，如荷當局允諾，即於最短期內復敎。記者按該會所提六項建議，業經吳市長同意，於昨日上午簽字允諾。該會於昨日下午獲悉後，將定於明日（三日）復敎。</p>

<h3>爲使紗布調節合理化　中樞擬設新機構　政府施策民間利益兼籌並顧</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：中樞當局爲使紗布調節合理化，可能考慮於全國經委會之下，設一專事調節紗布之機構。關係方面表示：目前紗布硬性議價制度之執行，顯已與事實需要相逕庭。例如國營紗廠之產紗，始終按照議價配售，惟以黑市價格，常高於議價，致使　營紗廠之營業管理，發生莫大之困難。如何消除該項予盾現象，則勢必調整當前紗布對策，俾　民營紗廠，兩皆受益。故新紗布調節機構之產生，已有其客觀環境之需要。該項新機構之成立，其主持人選，必縝密遴選。執行方面，尤需力求超然。俾對政府紗布施策，及民間利益，能兼籌並顧，以獲求紗布最圓滿之出路云。</p>
<p>又悉：中樞當局對中國紡建公司目前營業方針之未定，職工待遇之低劣，均深表同情，決將就實際情形，而加以改善。聞新任經濟部長陳啓天，將於本週內蒞滬，陳氏將實地視察本市棉紗業情形，而決定紗布之整理對策云。</p>
<h3>中央合作金庫　推進合作金融制度　合作貸款通過該款統籌貸放擬發行債券五百億充實資金</h3>
<p>中央合作金庫負責人語記者，該庫目前主要任務爲扶助綏靖區合作事業之發展。惟我國經八年離亂，廣大農村，土地荒蕪，生產萎縮，已爲整個經濟問題重要之一環。故發展合作事業，以改善農村經濟，實屬急需之圖。該庫已於全國成立六分庫，八支庫。其原有川，贛，浙，桂，閩，滇等六省合作金庫，與重慶市合作金庫，均將於近期內依法改組，正式開業。但以目前該庫資金，僅有國庫增撥專款三十億元，自難担任上項艱難任務。因之當局已考慮予以下列各項支持。（一）由政府通知四聯總處，轉知各行局，對該庫供給鉅額資金之透支。（二）各行合作貸款，應透過該庫，統籌貸放。（三）該庫發行債券五〇〇億元，由各行局分別承祖。（四）該庫得以票據分別向各國家銀行爲貼現或再貼現，並得以保險單向中信局爲再保險，從而奠定合作金融制度云。</p>
<h3>皂燭原料銷暢</h3>
<p>皂燭原料，因氣候關係，各方需求頗殷，實銷突轉暢旺。各貨做價，均見挺俏，月牌燒碱每桶漲至七百七十萬元，軋升六十五萬元之巨，美貨價亦帶好至七百五十萬元。泡化碱客帮納胃甚健，侮磅價自二千二百五十元升至二千六百元，漲三百五十元，椰子油升五萬元爲一百十萬元。N松香侮聽上升三萬元，爲五十五萬元。高度白臘，每担較漲十萬元，爲一百四十萬元。司的令現貨軋缺，外埠需求孔殷，每祖漲高至三百八十萬元，續升三十萬元。</p>
<h3>郵包輸入禁運品無須輸入許可證</h3>

<h3>民食調配委員會　今日正式成立　委員七人由吳開先兼主任職員八十餘人各機關調用</h3>
<p>負有供應滬市民食，抑平食米價格責任之民食調配委員會，經吳市長糧食部谷部長，中央銀行總裁張嘉璈等會商結果，決定設立後，曾一度由糧部龐次長在滬邀集有關各機關代表舉行籌備會議，擬定組織方案，及工作範圍，携京作最後決定。茲悉該會委員人選已定爲七人，計社會局長吳開先，糧食部葉參事，中央信託局任顯章，曁參議會，市商會，總工會等。將由吳開先局長兼主委，吳局長此次赴京，出席全國物價會議，預定今日返滬。故民食調配委員會即定今日下午正式成立。地點爲西門路山東旅滬同鄕會內。該會之任務爲調節民食，主持配售等事宜，機構頗爲龐大，將需辦事人員八十餘名。茲爲節省開支起見，所用職頁，大部份擬向各機關調用云。</p>

<p>農林部經濟部蠶絲產銷協導委員會，以蘇浙兩省，蠶繭均已上市，茲規定核准貸款廠商繳納墊頭，訂定貸款合約之截止日期爲六月三日，逾期即取消貸款資格云。</p>
<h3>霉季漸近　捲烟市況少神</h3>
<p>捲姻市况以霉季期近，塲中吐賣頗多，同業由於存底尙充，進意懈怠，晨初十支大英烟由七百四十五萬元喊開，旋小至廿五萬元，始有買戶。午後市氣又吿下挫，塲內出多進少，十支大英姻七百十八萬收　，比之上日侮箱回降三十二萬元。老刀亦步小　六百十八萬元，五華哈德門兩　，價亦　　十六七萬元。其餘各廠出之大美麗　門白蘭地及廿支裝各牌條姻，亦都總降。</p>
<h3>華茶輸出業　請求政府救濟</h3>
<p>中國茶葉聯營公司　經理　　成，爲　茶　出業目前　於艱境，向當局　陳困難，已於昨夜晉京。據悉此行將向四聯總處面呈二點：</p>
<p>（一）新茶貸款請速貸放，因祁門茶雖吿棄置，平水屯溪茶正待搶救，貸額暫放二〇〇億，總額再議。</p>
<p>（二）去年陳茶約×萬擔，押於中農行，價値約在美金一六〇萬左右，但茶商以去歲資金擱置，賠累至鉅，如以此項國外市塲價格售出，將不足償付押款，故希望當局爲扶植此僅有之重要輸出業起見，飭由中農行從權辦理。</p>
<h3>火柴俏利肥皂轉疲</h3>
<p>日用品市面，以火柴最俏，新美麗火柴最後價做高至二百六十九萬元，比上日續升六萬元，鳳風牌亦高至二百七十二萬元，每箱軋升十萬元之巨，玫瑰南京金鼎等新牌貨，亦升四五萬元不一。</p>
<p>肥皂市面脚地頗軟，蓋聞外埠同　需要　寸殷切，在塲中轉吐甚多。又有向廠方直　開進之大批黄祥茂　　，每箱廿六萬元，一星期交貨，以致市氣疲　無神。　　　　　皂一百廿塊每　　小一萬一千元，爲二十六萬三千元。固本館刀光　等牌亦均軋小一二千元至五六千元不等。聞中　　皂公司擬將黄祥茂等廠　略予調整，計黄祥茂每箱廠盤改爲二十六萬元，日光皂三十九萬元，藥皂三十七萬元，惟白祥茂等各貨仍維原盤。至五洲皂廠之固本皂，本週內可進行派貨手續，聞每家同業可得十箱至二十箱。</p>
<p>本市一週間　重要商品市價比較表（漲×跌）</p>
<h3>進出口業自力更生　組織聯營公司　資本定百億至五百億</h3>
<p>本市進出口業以目前業務，輸出虧蝕，輸入無外匯供給，陷於半停頓狀態，農工商業均蒙受其害，影響國民經濟發展之前途至鉅。爲挽救進口業之危機，經計劃組織大規模中國進出口聯營公司，預定資本總額爲一百億至五百億元。茲分誌各情如下：</p>
<p>組織原則　該公司組織之原則如下：（一）集合所有願意自動參加之進出口同業，無論單營進口出口或兼營進出口業者，甚至僑胞之握有僑匯，國人之掌有外匯，企業家之願意進口原料機器或出口其成品者，均可參加。（二）以旨趣相同之集合體，在同一機構之下，以股東身份之出口商所得之外匯，供給同爲股東身份之進口商。而以股東身份之進口商所得之利潤，彌補同爲股東之出口商所蒙受換失。簡言之，無論進口出口，或兼營進出口，旣在同一組織之下，取得相同之股東身份，以維持與發展國際貿易爲標的，相反相成，利害與共。（三）旣在同一組織下，同爲股東，出口所得之外匯處置，自然不成問題。進口需要之外匯，仍由民間運用。楚弓楚得，國際貿易可因此漸臻繁榮，而進出口連鎖制之缺陷，亦可藉集體之努力妥善補救。（四）政府現行國際貿易政策，旨在嚴格管制　節外匯，鼓勵出口，限制進口，保持與開拓國際市塲。中國進出口聯營公司適可符合政府預期之顧望。蓋管制對象，由複雜而單純，自能收事半功借之效，此其一。聯營公司旣以其自身所得之　　外匯自身經營進口業務，如能充分發展，則不僅不必仰求政府供給外匯，政府若事實有所需要，反可由公司提出一部份外匯，供給政府，此其二。聯營公司在通盤之營業方針下，以高額進口利潤，彌補出口虧蝕，實事求是，不尙空談，則不僅不可能之出口變爲可能，使國際市塲得以保持於不墮，達到輸出推廣目的。而進口旺盛，對于我國工業生產之持續，物價之抑制，國際收支之平衡，亦均有莫大之裨益，此其三。</p>
<p>創辦特質　關於該公司創辦之特質，項點如下：（一）聯營公司應爲進出口同業打開僵局，共謀福利而組織之企業，絕非獨佔國際貿易之托拉斯。（二）聯營公司應爲公開並兼顧其他各業福利之組織，不應具有排外性與排他性。在此前提之下，尤其對於中國工農業之要求，首予充足。如爲中國工業品及農產品之外銷尋求出路，爲建設及持續生產所需之機器原料等增多進口所應，並以進口物資吸收僑匯與國外存款。（三）聯營公司應協助政府經濟政策，充裕國家稅收，丈須擁護戰後經濟建設政策，培養國民經濟之基礎，絕非於國策之外，另闢途徑。（四）聯營公司本協助進出口同業之旨，採取相互委託聯營制，使與公司發生商業關係，同業中之經營出口者，由公司負擔國際市塲價格變動之風險，將其所得外匯結與聯營公司之前提下，不可能之出口成爲可能，幷獲得合理之利潤。經營進口者，亦可受公司之委託，經營輸入貿易，不使遭受國內市塲價格升降之威脅。使不易進口者，幷獲得合理之盈餘。（五）聯營公司應爲純粹之人民企業，其資本出自民間。</p>

<h3>日內瓦　十五日航訊　莊智煥　從歐洲看中國</h3>
<p>本年三月初旬，筆者奉派赴歐，深自慶幸。憶自民國九年第一次出國，在歐洲繼織求學，並利用暑假，周游歐陸十四國，返　董已忽忽廿三年矣。同時，第一次以一初自大學畢業之　年前往觀察第一次世界大戰後之情勢，與此次以服務廿餘年後之中年觀察第二次大戰後之情形，兩相比較，觀感實多不同。和會不能隨勝利而即舉行，各國間之矛盾衝突，鈎心鬥角之景象，尙在繼續展開，在在均足影響我國。苦命之中國在八年艱辛抗戰中，犧牲巨大，原期勝利後得以補償一切，孰知在抗戰中所得到之國際地位，竟又一落千丈，眞如啞子吃黄連，有苦說不出！於四月五日首途，趕赴日內瓦四月十日之會，時間偬促萬分，現在記者就一路見聞，夾叙夾議，爲讀者增一些檢討與參考之資料。</p>
<p>「法國天空島」</p>
<p>五天內自亞洲經非洲到歐洲。</p>
<p>五日淸晨起來，趕到法國航空公司，再換乘大客車到江灣飛機塲。軍用飛機塲，本來非有通行證，不能駛入；可是大客車到達塲門，衛兵方疲倦伸懶腰，未遑檢騐通行證。我國是「立法務嚴，執法務寬」，衛兵之失職，不過我國人馬虎性格，與法治不行之一例證而已。法國飛機題名爲「法國天空島」，與旁邊停着之美國運輸機一模一樣；本是一母所生，過房給人，自無怪其然。可是法國人究竟能利用他來組織國際飛行網。七時引擎發動，七時廿分起飛經過上海上空，我國沿海各省；下望則平整之土地均已墾殖。華族爲最動謹之莊稼民族，種田是拿手好戲，可是除莊稼外，許多農業，如同植林，畜牧，却不擅長；所以森林削伐過甚，高坡闢爲梯田，使土壤容易變壞。就國家民族百年大計上看，實待指導改進。當年關中沃野千里，現在却旱災瀕仍，黄土斫裂；東南濱海，雨量較多，自然不至如此，然而許多宜於畜牧之坡地，是否價値闢爲農田，仍是一大疑問也。縣政府忙於奉行上級之政命，行政經費尤少，那一縣長，能有閑工夫來考察其　境內之各　地質地形來指導農民？</p>
<p>再經香港及海南島上空，飛入越南境，原始森林，稻田，河道均歷歷在目。沿途海水如靛，白雲如山，而二者間常有灰雲穿行；同是雲而一動一靜，雲端變化萬狀，而雲底大都平整，吾人在地面時無此感覺也。下午四時到達西貢飛機塲，計飛行約九小時，在上空可着大衣，到地則單衣汗流，氣候變化太劇，眞使旅客呌苦。到地又須辦若干手績，始能到旅館。西貢街道仍相當整飭，但是滿街軍人，聞法軍在越南境者共約廿萬人，然而除大都市外，法人仍無胆量敢於前往也。</p>
<p>西貢一日小駐</p>
<p>六日在西貢停留一天，原因爲法遠東航空綫終點爲西貢，到上海乃此綫之延伸也。西貢爲我華僑集中地，人數約卅餘萬，分廣肇海南潮汕福建及其他客帮。上述五帮，各有組織，互相爭競。有黨部，有團部，亦各自活動。華僑間之爭執，及法國越盟南折間之各爭地位，往往爲難了我當地總領事館。有時集會時掛旗成大問題，爲避免糾紛起見，祇得一旗不掛。法越問題之前途多艱，我政府應付法國及越南之態度，似應愼重考慮，才不至再蹈怱促簽訂中法協定而包括越南，使我在越北受降之佔領軍陷入進退維谷境地之覆轍也。</p>
<p>七日晨六時半，離旅館至飛機塲，其中有少數旅客，經　察詢問始登機。七時半起飛，九時在東埔寨境之Angkor上空低飛　行一匝，城池方整，建築維偉，至荒草蔓蘿，故宮離黍，則祇可想像得之。此巨石離刻所成之千年古宮，據考古家稱：爲其中興雄主信佛，並紀念其后，同時自像爲佛之構造，耗費金錢人力，終致國力消盡。現代世界之如此國家尙多，吾人亦不遑爲已衰亡之Champs族悲哀矣！</p>
<p>過仰光，已十一時三刻，房屋櫛比，金塔耀目。下午一時十分，經阿恰布——爲日本軍所到最西處。三時到加爾加答。因西行逐日嬴得時間，故當地時間祇下午一時半也。着地熱甚，在機塲見中航機三，在國外見國旗，其欣慰興奮可知也。繼防疫證及護照檢騐後，即在塲進餐，休息一小時餘後，再登機起飛。至上空漸凉，行二層雲間，遇風則顚簸搖擺，夜午（當地夜十時）到喀喇蚩，已萬家燈火，繼檢査手續，即上樓入旅室。在機中與阮文賢談：此人爲越南遜皇保大之宮內尙書，現送其女至法國讀書，並語其在巴黎工作之長子。彼言昔年之服官者，愈淸覆廉潔，愈爲人民所敬重，身後之事，則由公家量情代理，不如近世之服官，必求報酬與工作相稱云。此正東方舊文明與西方文明之分歧處。加爾加答及喀喇　，均陸　空聯　，較我上海爲佳。上海爲我國最大商埠，而陸海空未能聯　，實爲一大缺點。</p>
<p>考試權與憲政</p>
<p>八日晨五時起身，六時十分登機，比即起飛，明月尙高懸，濛氣猶未退，喀喇蚩爲戰時委地，其發展亦在戰時爲盟軍駐地，我遠征國軍亦嘗在此訓練，然地殊貧瘠，邱陵緒紅，不能種植之地居多，建築大多爲舊式營房。</p>
<p>讀雜誌，獲知美國人正在指　其國會，謂議員爲討好選民計，大都爲本地利益，本業利益爭，而不顧國家之損失，爲議會政治之一流弊。我國昔時之從政者，由考試出服官，必在他省，此固有帝皇維持權位之意味在內，然其保持大一統，使全國全民權益，高於私人利益之功，自亦不容忽視。中山先生之以五權代三權，亦未始不思以考試補救選舉之弊。惜我今日未能善用此考試權，不過以高考普考爲登庸之一種資格，亦猶存「一舉成名天下知」，「大挑知縣」，或「老虎班知府知縣」之觀念，或以居闈主考爲榮之意識，安存眞爲以考試制度糾正選舉流弊着想耶？我國實行憲政，爲期非遙，對此問題，我政府當亦値得注視也。</p>
<p>越阿刺伯沙漠</p>
<p>飛機沿阿刺伯海濱行，越阿曼角入波斯灣，伊朗伊拉克境大都一片灰黄，無樹木花草。近巴士拉則河道縱横，棕棗成林，一片深綠中夾白色阿刺伯式建築，另有一番風景。一時十分到達巴士拉飛機塲，此地陸海空聯運，有鐵道通巴格達，有五六千噸輪船數艘在泊。下機在站進食，侍役均回敎，所食亦祗牛羊矣。二時再登機，二時四十分起飛，（當地時間爲十二時十分），比越阿刺伯沙漢時，飛機震盪不已，因當沙漠上空氣流不穩之故。再飛四十分鐘，即到開羅矣。下機經防疫證及護照檢査，醫官前旅客排列，而彼仍閑談理私事，氣燄頗高，同行李濟歐武官，因身着軍裝，故被警察留難，蓋英軍於三月一日退出埃及，故埃人方以完全獨立自蒙自驕，亦不復顧國際禮節，人類往往在心理上有錯綜，殊覺可憐可槪。離飛機塲即到旅館，建築甚宏偉華麗，街道亦條潔整齊，市而熱鬧，車輛如織，此大英帝國一百年來心血之象徵，一旦放棄，無怪邸吉爾輩痛心也。忽促中亦復與同行錢湯三君往憑弔金字塔及Sphivx，並欣賞尼羅河之蔚藍靜緩，在兩岸聳崎之高樓大厦間，流進此塔，此河幾經滄桑，今埃及又獨立矣。王宮以霓虹皇冠爲飾，未免庸俗。聞埃及政府多宴集各國外交人員，應酬幾無虛夕，或習於者年法國宮廷外交之遺風歟？埃及在政治上受英國影響，在文化上則受法國影響，較深法語，在開羅可通行。惜一般埃人，發音特殊，其法語英語均不易懂。至商舖機關則均以阿文表示，汽車牌照，亦另列阿文，其實通行數碼，本阿刺伯文，惟經簡明化耳。男子除大都保留其平頂紅帽黑帽外，及一部份人仍衣長袍外，均改服西裝。女子則少數西服，多數仍埃裝，但面幕已去，非復廿年前景象矣。華僑在埃及者約四十餘人，大都爲負販國貨絲　繭綢者，現在來貨無着，皆成流落，我國政府當設法將彼等送回本國也。</p>

<h3>杭永鐵路的胚胎</h3>
<p>— 杭州廿七日快訊　本報特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>如果全國各地沒有戰事，那麼浙江境內的建設事業或許不會這樣迅速順利的開展。單拿浙贛鐵路來講吧，這許多鋼軌，本來華中，華北，東北的鐵道都需要使用的，但因爲那邊正燃燒着烽姻，所以大部都可以讓浙贛路來應用。拿水利工程來講吧，原來全國各地都要興辦水利，水利工程專家將不够分配，現在浙江有着很多的永利工程專家。這都該爲浙江慶幸的吧？浙江的人民，以及浙江的官吏，都該把握住這個時機，迎頭趕上！浙江省主席沈成章氏，他曾經有過詳細偉大的建設計劇，其最主要的是疏通錢江，利用錢江的水力，來作種種的建設事業。還有是溝通兩浙的交通，完成浙江的鐵路網，建築杭永鐵路。沈氏曾說如果完成了這兩件事，死也瞑目。以這種精神來從事浙江的建設，我們應該預祝成功的。</p>
<p>杭永鐵路應循路綫</p>
<p>關於錢已經有很紹了，並且已經設立錢江海塘工程局，其初步整治錢江的步驟已在開始。關於杭永鐵路，還在計劃的時期，我們不妨說他是在胚胎中，關於這個胚胎的種切，記者想爲之陳述一下：</p>
<p>浙省雖稱各項事業進步的一省，但是浙東浙西因爲山河的阻隔，如果由浙西要到浙東，廢時甚久，反不如繞經上海，由海路南下，再經內河上行，來得便捷。所以以交通的一點來講，還不是理想的境地。沈成章氏於是有建築杭永鐵路之議，所謂「杭」「永」，即是杭州到永嘉，永嘉舊名溫州，是浙江沿海的一個大埠。沈氏向中央陳說後，即商請浙贛路局代爲察勘路綫，奉命査勘的於二月初旬籌備，十八日由杭州出發，於四月三日査勘竣事。</p>
<p>杭永鐵路的路綫，原可由紹興，平水，王城，毅來，封田嶺，又循剡溪支流南下，經烏岩，澄潭，雙溪口，王渡裏，又抵馬家溪，直抵後峙嶺脚，然後沿夾溪，轉山茅溪南下以至天台，再由天台至永嘉。還可由曹娥，嵊縣，改循剡溪東流達新昌，再到班竹，候蔣附近，又沿另一小溪到王渡裏，又抵馬家溪，直抵後峙　腳，然後沿夾溪轉山茅溪南下以至天台，再由天台至永嘉，但據査勘者言，以上兩綫工程較大。費時較久，須開發隧道者有多處，最短的隧道，其長度猶達兩公里。沿綫絲，茶，烟，木等物產，近年產量銳减，又加缺乏大量礦產，無論就工程或經濟方面立塲講，此兩路綫均無採取的理由。又據査勘者主張，杭永鐵路應循杭甬路自寗波　橋起，過餘姚江後，沿鄞江左岸，經榤社，江口，到奉化，由奉化南下，經方門，西　，鳧溪，繞過楊梅嶺再南下，經梅林，冠莊，抵寗海，復西行，過尖溪，至黄壇街，再經古岫嶺，抵梁王街更南下，經大溪王，至白梁橋附近，過白溪，此後須循山坡漸上，至桑洲嶺腰，旋折而東南，沿泳溪行，經河柳鎭後，折而南，過桶盤嶺，再折而西行，抵海游鎭，嗣後溯珠溪而上，經珠岙之南，再西上至交視及横頭戴，更進至亭頭宅附近，乃循始　溪而上直抵天台，此段在桑洲嶺須築隧道，約三百四十公尺；在餘姚江須築大橋，惟較內地兩綫，容易建造。所以査勘者擬採取之，此綫自寗波起，經奉化寗海海游至亭頭宅附近，路綫須分兩綫，一至天台縣城，是謂天台支綫，一循始豐溪南下，爲正綫，正綫經中渡，赤繆，石佛洋抵臨海，並在臨海縣城近郊過始來溪，改循右岸而下，至三洞橋與長甸，仍循江邊而下，抵江口鎭附近，過永寗江，惟此處江面寬約七百公尺，或將路綫展長至黄岩附近過河。過永寗江後路綫分東行至海門，爲海門支綫，東南行經路橋，牧嶼，横峯橋，溫嶺街，爲正綫，乃循海岸而行，再經胡霧，大荆之南，及白溪街而抵淸江渡，此處須築大橋，再經龍宅嶺，此嶺可開控，抵虹橋鎭，復經樂淸縣城，南趨柳市及琯頭之西，乃折而西行，溯甌江北岸而上，直抵永嘉對面港頭爲止。上述全路，可分爲兩個階段，自寗波起至寗海，約八十三公里。由寗海經海游至天台，約八十三公里。由天台抵海門，約八十四公里。總長爲二百五十公里，擬作爲第一階段。自江口抵淸江渡，約七十三公里，自淸江渡抵港頭，約六十二公里。總長一百三十五公里，擬劃作第二階段，全綫長三百八十五公里。</p>
<p>擇取路綫三項理由</p>
<p>杭永路採取這一條路綫，其理由爲：（一）沿海人口稠密，物產富饒，且有天台，雁蕩諸名勝，足可吸引遊客，增益營業收入。（二）象山港，三門灣，樂淸灣等爲天然軍，商漁業良港，亟待整建開發，尤非賴鐵路補給培養不可。（三）此路綫適爲國父計劃中之東方，南方兩大港間海岸綫必經之地。此路如建藥完成，直接　固國防，發展工商業，間接促成　　計劃兩大港間海岸綫的實現。全綫各縣，均以產糧食爲主，其他如鄞縣的蓆草麪粉，奉化的竹木柴炭，永菓，罐頭，寗海的木材竹子，魚類，苔菜，三門的棉蔴，煤，鋅，鐵，魚類。天台的桐油柴，硫磺，石英，鐵，臨海的棉蔴，土絲，布，魚類，石灰，砩石，黄岩的水菜，魚類，溫嶺的棉，捲烟，陶器，魚類，樂淸的魚類，永嘉的植物油，桔柑，茶葉，姻絲，棉綫，臘紙，藥，傘，捲烟火柴等。</p>
<p>全綫名勝美不勝收</p>
<p>全綫的名勝　縣境內有始於晉代的名刹天童寺，它包有觀音洞與玲瓏岩諸勝距城約六十華里。鎭海縣境內有始於周厲王時，的育王寺，與十八里廣，諸峯林立含七十二溪流的東錢湖；奉化境內有雪竇寺，千丈岩，妙高台隱潭，錦屛山，中塔，岳林寺等；　海有明賢方正學讀書處的躍龍山，方正學戚族骸骨投埋處的主我并亭，羅適哭母處的慈母石，發正學　學處的石鏡精舍寺；三門有晋代古刹廣潤寺，明方國珍義祥地的赤墈，宋高宗南渡投　於江的車馬渡，張蒼水殉國處的猿聲夕籟，三山間立之三門潮汐等，天台有八景，建築雄偉的國淸寺，漢武帝慶歲的赤城山，能觀東海的華頂寺，拜經台，有石樑飛瀑的方廣寺，歷代帝星欽賜古物頗多的萬年寺，土名石筍的螺溪釣挺，伯夷叔齊餓死的桐柏宮，洞內能駐軍三萬人的寒岩明月，還有仙人座，淸溪落雁，斷橋積雪等；臨海有巾子山，龍顧山，金　山，白楓山諸勝，黄岩有宋朱　曾講學於此的九峯山；流　有相傳葛仙修道處的丹崖，樂淸則有馳名中外的雁蕩山，是山諸峯峭拔險怪，上聳千尺，森然干霄，山頂有湖，方十里，水不涸，春雁歸時，多宿於此；山有東西內外谷，東外谷峯五，東內谷峯四十八，西內外谷峯二十四，建寺十八，名各別。諸峯有石壁數百伋，有飛瀑千丈，有諸溪會成之巨淵，淵側石檻有窟如井深窈不測等奇勝；永嘉有榮山，陀頭古寺等。</p>
<p>各方估算三年還本</p>
<p>據查勘者報告：第一期寗波至海門二百五十公里，包括總務，籌備，購地，路基築造，隧道，橋工，路綫保衛，電報及電話，軌道，號誌及轉轍器，車站及房屋，機件，車輛，維持等各項費用在內，國內工料款共需一千五百四十一萬萬二千六百四十五萬元，外洋料款共需七百十一萬二千〇五十美金元。第二期海門至永嘉一百三十五公里，包括與第一期同樣的各項費用國內工料款共需九百十八萬萬八千一百四十五萬元。外洋料款共需四百十七萬三千四百八十美金元。總計全程共需國幣二千四百六十萬萬，七百九十萬元，共需美金一千一百二十八萬五千五百三十元。照官價每一美金折法幣一萬二千元，爲一千三百五十四萬萬二千六百三十六萬元。總共計國幣三千八百十四萬萬三千四百二十六萬元。其鐵路營業收入，比照國有鐵路票價酌定客運每人每公里爲四十元，佔計旅客總數寗波至海門爲二百六十八萬二千七百元，寗永全綫爲四百〇四萬四千二百人，則每年客運總收入寗海爲一百七十一萬萬六千九百二十八萬元，全綫總收入爲二百五十八萬萬八千二百八十八萬元。再比照國有鐵路貨運每噸公里六十元，假定每年寗海第一階段收入爲五十一萬萬，全綫五十七萬萬一千八百萬元。連客運貨運全部收入假定如上數，那麽共爲五百三十八萬萬五千二百十六萬，如照這個數字，那麽六年的經營，即可還本。不過這個估計均爲第一年，而且也估計第一年內全綫工程即可完竣的。如果第一年內全綫工程能如期完被，相信第二年的營業收入必可倍增，則或不上三年即可還本。</p>
<p>胚胎形成促其出世</p>
<p>現在主要的問題，浙省政府有決心辦這一件事，而沒有這一筆錢；有人建議發公債，省政府正愼重計劃中，其實這三千萬萬的數字只要幾個有先見的鉅商捐獻一下就行了。我親自知道有好多在上海的鉅商，請一席酒就要千萬元以上，我看他們的宴會一年之中何止二百次，像這樣的鉅商上海亦何止千數，那麽只要他們把宴會省下來就行了。不過中國到今天，沒有權利的事情誰也不肯去幹。例如發公債，中國人根本對公債不感興趣，而且攤派公債，雖然都是鉅商拿了去，但鉅商又攤派到下面，下面再攤派到下面，結果還是貧窮而忠實的農民來担負這個責任。我建議，如果政府一時抽不出錢來辦這件事，如果公債不能發行，那麽乾脆官督商辦。這種例子在美國是很多的。今天的中國，我認爲也可以這樣辦，或許可以减少游資的不芷當活動，目前經濟的情形倒還會稍稍安定些。</p>
<p>事不宜遲，瑛在是浙江建設的最好機會，旣然有了胚胎，已在今年二月，那麽按照人的出生慣例，九個月以後，就可以呱呱墮地了，當然一樁鉅大的事業不能與人的出生比，但今年十月，我們總盼望能見到它的興工。</p>

<h3>上海港埠應如何發展？</h3>
<p>— 施孔懷</p>
<p>港埠成立之主要條件：第一，必須具有相當深度，水面足　進出口輪船　行無阻；第二，更須具有天然或人工屏障，以掩護往來船舶，免受風浪襲擊。此外爲便利船舶停靠，應有　頭設備；爲便利貨物上下，應有起卸工具；爲便利貨物儲藏。應有倉庫建設；爲便利貨物集散，更應有便捷運輸，以與國內外相聯繫，惟港埠之繁榮與否，則純視腹地之情形如何而定。按上海位居揚子江口，有物產豐富面積七十五萬方英里佔中國本部之半人口二萬萬之揚子江流域，爲其腹地；又就沿海而論，上海居南北洋航運之起訖點，自前淸道光二十二年（一八四二年）開闢商埠以來，經過百餘年人力不斷之經營，人口已臻四百五十餘萬，工廠林立，貿易繁盛，生產與消耗爲數可觀。是則上海地位之優越，與將來可能之發展，實爲世界任何港口所不及。宜其在戰前每年進出口貿易額幾達全國進出口貿易總額百分之五十，又其進出口船舶噸位達四千萬噸，爲世思第九大港。</p>
<p>民國三十五年，上海進出口船舶統計爲一千四百萬噸，若無下半年美國海員罷工風潮，則其噸位當可增加，但亦不致超出二千萬噸。按戰前上海港口旣能容納四千萬噸，爲何戰後船舶不足二千萬噸，而遽致港口擁塞？考其原因，不外（一）戰時毀壞碼頭尙未完全修復；（二）被敵人拖往他處應用之浮碼頭多數尙未收回補充；（三）倉庫存儲敵僞貨物尙朱完全出淸；（四）起卸貨物遲緩；（五）一部份碼頭淤淺；（六）一部份碼頭浮筒劃作軍用。但以上情形，均係一時現象，經過相當時期，自可逐漸改善，恢復戰前呑吐能量，毫無疑義。</p>
<p>此次抗戰勝利，國土重光，但戰時吾國物資所受損失，至爲浩大。故戰後忙於復員救濟，一時尙無餘力從事積極建設，更不　顧及經濟繁榮。惟建設爲吾國將來生存關鍵，開始建設，刻不容緩。一經開始，則所需器材正多，凡國內不能供應者，必須仰給於國外。又建設以後，我國生產物資國內不能吸收者，必向國外推銷。是則上海港口，縱使恢復至戰前能量，仍感不足以適應需要。根據以往統計，上海進出口船舶噸位，每隔三十年增加一倍，可爲證明。又國內外人士咸認如我國政治經濟一且安定，上悔港口將與紐釣倫敦並列，而爲世界主要大港。是以上海港埠究應如何發展，方能負起此種重大使命，實爲切要問題。茲特不揣議陋，提出下列諸點，以供檢討：</p>
<p>（一）水深問題</p>
<p>欲求船舶進出便捷，港口水面必須有適當深度。依照經濟原則，船舶載重量愈大，則運輸成本愈輕。但船舶載重量大，則其吃水必深。故國際航運會議曾規定港口水深以四十八英尺爲標準。紐約港口，蘇彝士，及巴拿馬運河，水深均在四十英尺左右。上海黄浦江航道，水深最淺處在最低水位下二十六英尺，大汛時潮高八英尺，可得水深三十四英尺，小汛時潮高六英尺，可得水深三十二英尺。進出上海港之外洋船舶，通常吃水自二十四英尺至一十八英尺，然吃水三十英尺以上之船舶，進出亦屬不少。吃水三十一英尺六英寸之郵船柯立芝總統號於民國三十年，又吃水三十二英尺一英寸之油輪Walden號於民國二十六年，均曾先後駛入上海港口。可見現在上海港口水深雖能應付，惟與世界大港通行之四十英尺水深，相差尙遠。不久將來吾國工農產品出口數量增加，則進出口貨物數量逐漸平衡，上海進出口船舶吃水之增加，自在意料之中。故濬浦局計劃，在不久將來，將揚子江口之神灘濬深，至小汎高潮時三十七英尺，黄浦江航道濬深至最低水位下三十英尺，俾吃水三十三英尺之輪船可以進出便捷，然後再按實際需要，逐漸加深，藉利航務商務。</p>
<p>（二）港埠佈置問題</p>
<p>碼頭爲船舶停靠所必須之設備，將來船舶增多，則碼頭必須添建，按碼頭建築，分突出式挖入式及平行式三種：突出式碼頭，即由河岸向河中突出建築，如紐約赫特生河兩岸之碼頭是。但該河寬一英里有餘，故兩岸雖各難碼頭長一千二百英尺，河道中間尙有三千英尺寬度，可作航道之甩。黄浦江下游寬度不過二千英尺，故突出式碼頭不能採用。再挖入式碼頭，由岸上挖入興建，如倫敦，利物浦及漢堡等處碼頭是。此種碼頭之利，在以有限之岸綫，可雞長度倍蓰之碼頭，其效用與突出式碼頭同，此其一。又水位高低相差甚多之處，船舶上下貨物極感不便，故通常水位相差在十二英尺以上時，每採用挖入式，並建造船閘，以保持水位而利起卸，規定船舶於滿潮時出入，此其二。至平行式碼頭，係沿岸與岸平行興建，上海一向採用此種式樣；將來仍沿舊貫，抑另採其他方式，社會人士意見頗爲紛歧。有主張上海港埠應該澈獨底重行計劃，廢止浦東浦西兩岸作爲碼頭倉庫區域，而叧擇吳淞日暉港等處，建築挖入式碼頭者。其主要理由，係沿浦興建碼頭停靠輪船，則貨物來往，易使街道交通擁擠。又挖入式碼頭配備鐵路，則可使輪軌聯運，運輸效率增高。査本問題可從運輸經濟及岸綫各方面研究。上海港口永位高低相差，通常不過八英尺，輪船進出並離平行式碼頭，據船公司意見，認爲最屬方便。至輪軌聯運，所有鐵軌建築於平行式碼頭之後，與建在挖入式碼頭之上，其效率並無軒輊。再査黄浦江，自張家塘上港界綫至吳淞口下港界綫，長凡二十三英里，即兩岸岸綫長達四十六英里，現在使用開發者不過一半。尤其自虬江碼頭至吳淞口兩岸，未開闢可利用之岸綫，足敷未來數十年擴充之需。戰前爲租界關係，故碼頭集中租界附近，此後應向吳淞發展，自屬最爲合理。蓋上海進口貨物，照以往統計，百分之四十復行出口至沿海沿江一帶，是項貨物卸在黄浦江下游，可轉裝江海輪船或火車出口，不必駛靠中區碼頭，减少港口擁擠。民國三十五年十月間，對於挖入式與平行式碼頭建築費曾作比較，假定造碼頭四千英尺，平行式建築費爲法幣一百十七億元，挖入式則爲一百七十一億，相差五十四億，換言之，挖入式建築費較平行式建築費約增百分之五十。不特此也，平行式碼頭可擇深水地方興建，毋須每年挖泥，反是，挖入式碼頭按往昔統計，每年淤淺達五英尺之多，因此每年挖泥費在五億元以上。此項增加費用當由輪船及貨物負擔，則無異增加商品價格。再查以往上海進口貨物，由輪船逕卸駁船轉運至沿河工廠及貨棧者，爲　頗鉅，其由輪船卸堆碼頭轉裝走車者較少。倘現在碼頭分散沿浦，對於此項載貨卡車已認爲阻塞交通，則採用挖入式碼頭後，輪船集中於數處裝卸貨物，則於卡車必經之公路衝要處所，其擁塞當屬更甚。從上立論，對於未來上海港埠之佈置，似可作下列各點之考慮：</p>
<p>（一）黃浦江爲上海港埠之生命綫，儘量利用浦江兩岸深水地帶，維持並擴建平行式碼頭，尤以虬江碼頭以下爲未來發展目標所在地。</p>
<p>（二）數十年後，平行式碼頭所需岸綫如確屬不敷時，再行籌建挖入式碼頭。虬江碼頭以下兩岸地畝，自應預爲保留，其離岸寬度以三千英尺爲準。</p>
<p>（三）貨物起卸設備問題</p>
<p>輪船裝卸貨物迅速，則其停留在港內之時間可以减少，即載貨有效之行駛時間可以增加。故港內起卸貨物之設備，極應研究。戰前上海人工便宜，爲經濟起見，儘量利用，以致碼稱上機械設備，絕無僅有。考海港起卸貨物之效率，以每英尺碼頭每年能上下若干噸貨物爲標準。民國十三年，上海每英尺碼頭起卸貨物二百八十五噸，較之紐約每年每英尺碼頭起卸一百五十噸，尙勝一籌。揆厥　　，不外紐約客運郵船來往頻繁，是項郵船載客多而載貨少，其次輪船公司在紐約所租賃之碼頭未能儘量利用停靠船舶。惟較之馬賽碼頭侮年每英尺起卸貨物一千五百噸之紀錄，則上海港口之效率相差甚遠。同時，上海目前工價之高，幾爲世界之冠，爲增加港口效率計，爲减輕運輸成本計，所有碼頭即應機械化；惟起卸工人定有一部份因而失業，此乃社會問題，事前應予以考慮。</p>
<p>（四）水陸空聯運問題</p>
<p>外國進口貨物到達上海後，除一部份就地吸收外，尙有百分之四十須轉口吾國其他各地。至出口貨則反是，由各地集中上海，然後輸出港埠。上海實爲水陸空運輸之樞紐，關係重要，務使外洋輪船與我國江輪海輪鐵路公路飛機互相聯遝，打成一片。故未來建設之碼頭上，不但須敷設鐵路公路，與幹綫聯絡，且須與航空機塲有密切之聯繫。一般心理以爲空運之運量小而運價高，每被忽視，但空運迅速。且上海不久將爲世界空運網重要站之一，機塲之佈置與碼頭間之聯繫，應同樣重視，達到貨物集散便捷之目的，减少倉庫擁塞之現象。</p>
<p>（五）浦江兩岸交通問題</p>
<p>黄浦江爲上海港埠重要資產之一，應儘量利用兩岸深水地帶，建造碼頭，前已論及。惟卸置在浦東之貨物而須在浦西使用，或須在浦西轉運兩岸，如何交通一點，値得硏究。現在交通方法，則係使用駁船。如貨物之存儲或使用地點臨靠河岸，並無不便；如離岸較遠，則須復用車輛轉載，多費一番裝卸手續。故簡捷辦法：一爲在浦江上建造橋梁，惟倘浩低橋，則在兩岸溶浦綫之中間，勢須建築橋墩，影響所及，必致改變河流制度，破壞浦江濬工。又橋之中部雖能活動通船，究竟有礙自由航行。倘造高橋，則橋面須在水面一百三十五英尺以上，船在橋下通行固無阻礙，但引橋過長，需要地位甚多。在熱鬧地區，顯有困難。二爲在黄浦江水面下九十英尺建築隧道，旣不妨礙浦江河流，復不妨礙船舶航行，引道亦無需如引橋之長，最合理想。遠如倫敦Thames河下，漢堡Elbe河下，近如紐約Hudson河下，利物浦Mersey河下，昂維斯Schlde河下，均建有隧道，可爲明證。惟建築隧道，關關於測量設計籌款等等，需要充分時間。現在市輪渡計劃建造之卡車渡輪，似應積極興建，並在各處擴展。將來並可在新龍華車站附近，建造中孔活動之低橋，俾鐵路路軌延伸至浦東高橋一帶，成爲環港鐵路，俾逗程長程過江貨運，鐵路可分担一部份責任。</p>
<p>（六）經營管理問題</p>
<p>港口效率之高低，固繫於設備之完善與否，但經營管理亦有重要關係。考各國港口經營管理方法，常以其歷史背景，政治制度，及經濟環境之不同而各異。在美國，每由國會通過法律，由各州州長指派及人民選舉代表，組織委員會，處理港務，如New　York，Boston，New　Orleans等港是也。但關於航道之河海工程，騐疫，及海關等工作，仍由聯邦政府負責。且在紐約費城兩地之碼頭，分別由市政府經管。在美國尙有港務公營公司，經國會准許，由當地人民選舉代表以理港務，其範圍並不甚大，如加州之Oregon及Portiand等是也。在英國，則盛行海港自治制度，由國會制定法律，由中央政府派定委員，當地議會機關推選代表，並由向該港納稅之公司人民選舉代表，組織委員會，處理航道碼頭倉庫起卸　　等　業務，可注意者，選舉代表之人數，較指派之人數爲多，此爲港口經營管理方法之　　大者。上海港口之經營管理，採取分工合作辦法，港口之管制，歸江海關負責；港口之警衛，由江海關之港警與市政府之水警，會同辦理；騐疫由衛生署　疫所辦理；浦江之濬治由濬浦局負責；至碼頭倉庫均由中外商人經營；公共碼頭倉庫爲數有限，爲取得密切聯繫起見，去年十月間成立港務整理委員會，促進港埠效能。將來是否即進而集中紐織，統一管理，一如倫敦利物浦之港務然，尙待研討決定。總之，一地之港務，地方政府認爲事屬地方性質，應由當地政府主持經管，中央政府認爲港埠之功能，關係全國對外貿易與國際航遝者至巨，超出地方範圍，應由中央主持。倫敦利物浦之港埠組織，可稱民主化，將中央政府地方政府航商及出口商各方利益，均予顧到，値得研究。</p>

<h3>蘇聯文學在美國</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>西蒙士（Ernest　J.Simmons）是美蘇學會的主席，又在哥倫比亞大學斯拉夫族語　系敎授蘇聯文學，並有論述杜思　益夫斯基，普希金和托爾斯泰的專著。最近他寫了一篇書評，介紹美國新譯的高爾基的「孤兒保爾」（Orphan　Paul）和新輯的托爾斯泰的中篇小說集。此外美國最近還出過高爾基的戲劇集。</p>
<p>「孤兒保爾」是一部中篇小說集，還附了一篇未定稿「我是怎樣成爲作家的」，都是第一次譯成英文的。寫實主義並不建立於屠格湼甫，杜思退益夫斯基和托爾斯泰，而是建立於高爾基。孤兒保爾原名「不幸的白夫爾」，是高爾基一八九四年初學文藝寫作時在下諾弗哥羅一家報紙上發表的，一直許多年都不曾被傳記家和批評家所注意。旗到去年蘇聯爲高爾基舉行逝世十局紀念時，纔注意到這種著作。</p>
<p>與高爾基早期的許多小說一樣，這小說寫的是兒童和少年時代的回憶，寫他祖父家庭的貧苦環境，童年的勞役，奇怪的僱主以及他對於鳥與自然的喜愛。事實上，保爾有若干地方都是高爾基的化身。他那特殊的寂寞與內省，以及他對於淫婦的純潔理想，都可以看出這裏面有他自己。保爾是被婦人憎恨者阿里斐撫養成長的，他的性格是警察與宗敎的混合。後米阿里斐的心境不能平衡，爲聖潔與罪惡所苦，終於進了瘋人院，就死在院裏。後來保爾在一個酗酒的鞋匠手下做學徒。他逐漸成長，對於人們不信任，特別是女人——阿里斐敎過他的，萬惡婦爲首。偏偏他遇見賣淫婦娜泰霞，使得他的生命增加了活氣，除去了他日常生活的寂寞，保證了愉快的將來。故事至此，可說帶有「漫郞攝什戈」前芬芳。保爾向她求婚，但她不慣於這種刻板的生活，不曾允婚，結果便陷於杜思退益夫斯基小說的陰慘，像「白癡」中所寫的謀殺者那樣，保爾就將這賣淫婦殺死了。</p>
<p>「托爾斯泰中篇小說集」與以前所判的「杜思退益夫斯基中篇小說集」一樣，都是「日規永久叢書」（Dial　Permanent　Library）中可讚美的書。本卷所收有「哥薩克兵」「伊凡伊里支之死」「風雪」「家庭幸福」等，所用的是英德（Aylmer　Maude）的譯文。惟未收「魔鬼」「包里庫西加」「主與人」等傑作，似爲篇幅所限。編者拉夫（Philip　Rahv）指出托爾斯泰的作風是眞實純樸的，沒有神秘和感傷、在小說中所表現的就是生命它自已。</p>
<h3>樂琴書以消憂</h3>
<p>— 許士騏</p>
<h3>「剪烟」自序</h3>
<p>— 司空無忌</p>
<p>我不能鬱壓我的感情；我愛遠眺在嬝散的村姻，我愛仰望舒展的白雲，我愛獨個兒竚立在山頂上發楞，注視着山底下迷矇游移的瘴雰。滿蘊着悲憫的淚珠，我痴心地對着夢　一般的世相。</p>
<p>曾經有一天，我向靈魂借着一面鏡子，照了照自己的胸臆。那會是什麽呢？——雲霧，濃雰；一縷縷的靑烟。籠罩着一個似乎是永遠的生命之謎。</p>
<p>於是，我悵惘乃至於憂鬱。然而，我却又不能安於忍受，我疲倦地躺在地上，掀開靈魂的蓋子，讓雲霧，濃雰，都幻成一縷縷的靑姻；飄着，飄着，舒徐地飄着。</p>
<p>我多麼渴望看一看雲霧濃雰的後面，暗藏着是些什麽啊！</p>
<p>這樣，我浮躁地向市儈的人世，投出了許多天眞的問話。却萬萬想不到道會引起許多有着過份潔癖的人們底憎惡。於是，我入獄，飄流，在死亡綫上掙扎……莫名其妙地接受了計多不該接受的痛苦。</p>
<p>有一個時候，我懷疑我已經喪失了生活的彈性——竟想離開這多災多難的人世。是愛戀（那是多末巨大的力量啊）挽回了我一度的絕望，我想起了那個死去了的葉紫，還有那個矜持的魯彥；我覺悟到逃避絕不是解決痛苦的好辦法。</p>
<p>於是，我又重新打算好好地活下去。由於這一種新生之希望的抬頭，我開始意識到在我的心靈　處隱隱地閃着一點光；像是夏夜的螢火蟲，亮着亮着；在黑暗中是多麼珍惜這一點光明啊！有人說，那正是我希望的太陽。是的，我竭誠企盼太陽來趕走我心頭的鬱氣—那些雲霧和濃雰。</p>
<p>現在，應該提到我底詩歌寫作的緣起了。</p>
<p>說起來，也有四個年頭，那時我和菊隱遭到同樣的痛苦；外則貧病交迫，內則國恨家愁。總之是心勞力瘁，我至今仍不忍回憶。我住在重慶的南岸向家坡。中秋節的晚上，夜深了。月光傾瀉着銀光，映照着長江上魚鱗的波濤，我過江去探望菊隱，我多麼企盼見着我那苦難中的朋友啊。可是菊隱沒有住在劇社裏，他出去了，深夜不歸，誰知道他的眼淚又傾流到那兒去了呢？</p>
<p>我寂寞地抬起沉重的頭，望着慘白的月光，我呻吟着老坡的水　歌頭。——「不離有恨，何事長向別時　？」我第一次掉下了十年未曾掉過的眼淚。風，寒激了我的心，把身邊僅有的一點錢，我換得了一次大醉。我的眼光雖然有些迷糊，可是，我的心很淸楚。拖着瞞跚的步子，回到南岸。那是最後的一班輪渡了。從江邊走到向家坡，並不太遠。我却足足走了三個鐘頭。當我試着將倦怠的身子放上床的時候，月亮已經被西邊的藩　撕裂了。極度的疲乏引起了極度的痛苦。痛苦得展轉不能入眠。起來，擰亮了燈；我寫下了一首安慰菊隱的詩。——這是我的第一首新詩</p>
<p>對於寫新詩，我一直沒有舅氣嘗試。可是，這以後，我覺得當時的感情沒有一種文體比詩歌表現得更爲恰當，更爲妥帖。</p>
<p>接着，我一共寫了十幾首小詩。曾經讓牠在萬秋主編的「靑光」上發表了好幾首。以後，我又託名爲白柯，寄給克家兄和遠在昆明的卞之琳先生。克家不知道是我，他在詩篇的後面批了好幾行字。他說這些詩的確是被生活壓榨出來的東西，但是太悲慘了；連意義，連調子，甚至於每一個字。之琳先生誠懇地要我珍惜這一份起碼的靈感。朋友們的謬許，使我有了些許的自信。我開始塗抹一些也算是詩的小東西。說到意義調子甚至於每一個字之所以悲慘；自然，生活的壓榨是大原因。我實不願再多加解釋。等到這裏，我請求克家兄特別原諒我，我一直沒有吿訴你白柯即是我的另一個筆名。因爲我實在沒有再氣在一位寫詩已有十五年的詩人面前，厚顏地獻出自己穉弱的心聲。我又曾哄瞞一位老詩人——他是中國文境的一顆巨星。我說這些小詩是我的年輕的朋友，一個才滿二十歲的靑年人學習寫的東西；求他改正。他沒有改，他只是沉吟了許久，慘淡地笑了一笑說；「太沉重了啊！這些都是中年人的心情，只有中年人才能了解。</p>
<p>感謝一塲大火，牠燒去了我一部份的衣物，牠又毫不吝惜地把我最初寫的十幾首過份陰黯的小詩燒個干凈。</p>
<p>在這個時代裏，高樓廣厦和人的生命同樣脆弱。何况，十幾首小詩，一向被人卑視爲無病呻吟（？）的東西？</p>
<p>可是，牠是我生命被壓榨出來的苦汁；我用憔悴的容顏換取了牠們；牠們的火葬和我有着骨肉的關聯。雖然是微末得那麽可笑的詩句。但是，請原諒我，我是中國人，我沒有戈果理的慷慨</p>
<p>我沉默了一年！</p>
<p>痛苦時，我讀楚辭，屈原應該是最爲我崇拜的詩人了。多少情感的激起，我第二次提起了寫詩的筆。大部份都保存在這本小集子裏。這其中每一首詩，幾乎都埋伏着一個故事，一段因緣。但我不願加上若干註解，作　蛇足。不够明達的地方，只能怪我表現能力的薄弱了。應該抱歉的，這些詩也許正像徐遲先生說的那樣，太舒徐，沒有火藥氣。不能反映時代。那末作爲對於那些着了魔的人們底靈魂的召喚吧！</p>
<p>如果有人責備我的詩不是爲大衆寫的。那末，我只有帶着怨恨的目光，回顧我過去恥辱的生活過程了。</p>
<p>等待着吧！等待着托爾斯泰所說到的「世界的火災」來到吧！讓他燒盡世紀的憂鬱，人類的苦悶。那末，我靈魂上小小的　結，自然也會化成一道姻，被那巨大的濃烈的火舌，噴散到天上去。</p>
<p>你看！雲霧和濃雰都散開了。太陽從地平綫下探出了她血紅的臉。（一九四五·春夜·渝。）</p>
<p>（附記）此稿由　行　中檢得，緬念舊雨，殊深惘然。</p>
<h3>夜行</h3>
<p>— 張沐么</p>
<p>那是一個深秋的晚間。</p>
<p>仰頭，有幾顆星星映着疲倦的小眼。田地秃丫頭。玉蜀黍的根子一梱梱續倒在田壠邊，遠看，像一羣熟唾的動物。風極微，但刺骨。</p>
<p>「大哥，還有好遠嘛！」</p>
<p>我側頭望望文洛，一張稚氣的臉已經鐫刻了很多的風塵，兩片枯葉似的薄唇蠕動着。</p>
<p>「快了。」</p>
<p>這是第五遍同樣的回答。他緊了緊脚步，不時聳動着斜掛在左肩的小包裹，用狐疑的眼睛叮住我。</p>
<p>「眞快了嗎？」</p>
<p>這次我沒有回答，狠狠地咬住牙，揮動麻痺的脚突出文洛兩步遠。</p>
<p>「大哥，我們歇歇吧？」</p>
<p>語音像一個絕望者的呼聲，我略一遲疑，——繼續舉起水泡裂破後疼痛的脚。</p>
<p>「文洛，忍耐一點，眞快到了。」</p>
<p>黃泥揉成的鄕村道在脚下翻騰，眼洞裏沙夾夾地；牙齒一磨，發出一陣細微的沙沙聲。</p>
<p>「大哥，你有鍋魁（大餅）嗎？」</p>
<p>「沒有了。到縣城吃頓好的。」</p>
<p>「吃——？」</p>
<p>他跳上來親切地抓住我的右膀，我感覺他的手在發顫。</p>
<p>我提起左手一只旅行袋，這意思他就明白了。</p>
<p>「你要賣？」</p>
<p>「嗯——」</p>
<p>他突然放鬆了我的臂，拿袖口悄悄地擦眼角。</p>
<p>在遠處，一簇篝火閃耀着，像一盞燈。孤獨的茅舍映出了一角。</p>
<p>「大哥，不要賣，你祗有這一套，賣我的——你說的陳主任，要在就好啦！」</p>
<p>我拉住他冰冷的手，輕輕撫摸着，心裏一陣難受，壓住嗓子低聲說：</p>
<p>「別孩子氣，反正一樣；賣了吃頓好的，陳主任管他呢！」</p>
<p>走着，走着，脚步有點兒滯重，心，彷彿被什麽抓住似的。脚步聲驚定了松樹尖的一只老鴉。</p>
<p>「大哥，我有點怕。記得那一年我從轉壩回家，妹妹伏在我肩頭睡着，天也是這樣黑，媽呌長林提了燈籠來接我，還帶了一包香糕—」</p>
<p>「不要提起過去的事。」我狂　的槍下來嚷着。</p>
<p>「唔——」</p>
<p>我偸眼看見文洛又提起袖子揩眼角。……</p>
<p>風雖　，但刺骨。望出去是一抹漆黑。路的盡有星星　着疲倦的小眼。</p>
<p>文　再一項將包裹換到右角。</p>
<h3>心祭</h3>
<p>— 子</p>
<p>獻給安眠在西北墓地的逢甲</p>
<p>是這樣一個岑寂的靜夜，黝黑的天空，　　地點綴了幾顆星星，伴着半　殘月，發出　騰的光輝，照着這失意人的臉，使效的心，變得更沉重且蒼老了。一陣陣的晚風，吹拂着披散在肩頭的長髮，擬起我愁緒萬千，往事悄悄地回到我的身邊，苦痛又在開始　食我破碎支離的心，我又跌入辛酸的回憶裏。</p>
<p>也記不起是怎樣地度過這三年來悠長的歲月，只感到自己像隻負重的駱駝，揹負了千百斤愁苦的重擔，舉着艱辛的步履，打發着這凄苦的日子，一直挨到現在。我總忘不了在這凄風苦雨裏的握別，可是，誰知道這叩人心絃的生離，却是我們的永訣呢？</p>
<p>爲了經濟力量的不够，爲了要完成你的狀志，在幾度磋商下，決定犧牲了我的學業來完成你，記得在離別的前夕，我們談到深夜，我們約定在以不變應萬變的原則下，期望着歡樂的後會，明朝，是在一個陰雨霏霏的淸晨，道踏上了旅途，我送你到河邊，爲了想相互安慰，我們都忍住了晶瑩欲滴的淚珠，但是最後，我們終於在珍重聲裏揮淚道別了。倚着河岸，我用糢糊的淚眼，望着凝立在船梢的你，頻頻揮手，直到看不見你影子的時候。回到家裏，我禁不住哭倒在牀了，但當我想到我們的約言，及未來的歡聚時，我忍受了一切，把千萬斛的離情別緒，寄托在未來的美夢裏。但是，誰知這你却永遠沒有歸期？我受不了委曲，向你訴苦，每次我總可在你這裏，得到更多的慰安，記得你來信曾對我說：「……蓮于，別太苦了你自己，我知道，當我們凱旋歸來的時候，你灰色的夢會褪去的。」但是現在，勝利已這麽久了，而灰色的夢也已變成黑色，但你的　期呢？你說！</p>
<p>因爲沒有饒，你　了不能　　　　　，由　期肋展炎而　肺病更至永離人間，是誰殺書了你！爲了怕我着急、你病不　我知這，在　已安　在西北的墓地時，我還在希　這歡樂的會語，　到多少對信都得不到回音時，我才開始懷疑，終於，噩耗傳來，使我昏倒了。我接到你朋友的來信，他說：「我把這個驚人的消息，一直隱瞞到現在，我不敢把它吿訴逢甲的親友，因爲它像一柄利刃，會刺碎每個人的心，但是看着你雪片似飛來的來書，我實在再也不忍欺騙你了，我代拆了你侮一封的來信，當我含着淚，讀完它的時候，我總把它送到逢甲的墓地，焚毀在他的墓前，算是給你轉寄，當他彌留時，他雖張大了嘴，但說不出一句話，他雖要了筆，但僵硬的手，寫不出一個字，當他死後不遠，仍雙目不閉，我知道他的心裏，放不下遠方的戀人——你！」當我醒來，回復到有意識時，我懷疑自己剛才做了一個惡夢，我不相信像你這樣一個善良的人，會眞的死去，可是看到拿在手裏的你的墓影與遺容時，我禁不住熱淚縱横而再度昏厥了。</p>
<p>現在，際此綠柳成蔭的時候，我遙想你的　草，該生滿如茵了，幽黯的月色照着我，也照着西北的一片墓地，想着這寂寞的景調，我眞想揷翅飛來，縱使看不見你迎人的笑臉，只親一親你的　墓也好，因爲在它的底下，躺着永眠的你。在你陰深的九泉，你的身體已否康健？你肯不肯與我答語？因爲我要問你，你爲什麽還不回來？</p>
<p>寫不盡的哀思片片，剪不斷的愁緒綿綿，千萬縷的哀愁，就此帶住罷，你人是死了，但你卻永活在我的心頭，永遠地，永遠地。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血524</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「並且也是很安全的走了！」守一說着，就返身邀着鶴見，從室內走去。</p>
<p>「安全的走了？」鶴見邊走邊問。</p>
<p>「對哪！」守一好像在遊覽博物院似的，平心靜氣，準備欣賞，心神十分安閑。</p>
<p>「……，可曾提到萍子的事？」鶴見沒有把此行的主標忘記，同時認爲那些淘氣們留下的顏色綫條，也同他發明的電訊密碼一樣精密，可以傳遞消息。</p>
<p>「萍子的事？」守一似乎把萍子的事，早已丟到爪哇國去了：「據我猜想，洶氣們旣然來了，決不能空手回去。您想她們爲什麽而來？不就是爲了萍子？如今走了，當然也把萍子帶走哪，—只要她是被困在這裏的……」</p>
<p>「這是您猜想的，還是符號上說明的？」鶴見跟着守一，走到這座屋子後門，上了石級，站在小走廊上，不肯走了。這個動作，是一種很明顯的表示：如若守一沒有把握，說明萍子已經脫險，鶴見大概就要單人獨騎，趕去追踪這羣剛剛逃走的匪人去了。</p>
<p>「這些符記，只於是說明某人來過，並指點這人現在的行踪，方向。」守一說到這裏，一眼發現正屋後門框上，又有許多綫條，雖在背光所在，好像有燐質成分在內，隱隱發出各色光綫，便指給鶴見看；「偌偌，您看，這些條道，頭一道是粉紅，那是大淘氣慧君的指定顔色，尖顯指到屋門內，表示她要進屋了；尾上兩個不規則的小圈，表示她知道假想的萍子小姐和另一肉票，準在屋子裏。……」</p>
<p>「哦，一種顏色代表一個人？」鶴見被這些綫條吸引着，暫且放下了萍子的事，似乎研究學理起來了，精神也較爲寗靜。</p>
<p>「對，我們百忍莊，每人有一個指定的　條顏色，」守一說着，便從衣袋裏　出了一段粉　似的東西：「這是我的指定顏色，」說着，就在那些顏色綫條上，繞着畫了一個大圈、是一種鮮明的黄色。（照百忍莊當日規定這些顏色的時候，凡顏色愈顯明的，表示本領愈高。）</p>
<p>守一畫了這道圈，便指着第二條淡紫色說；「這就是上旅社去拜會您想那位小　氣的符記，尖頭雖也指着屋子內，可是用的點綫，表示她從別一方面進屋；第三道，這條淡藍的，就是小淘氣的同胞姐姐，子玉，却是規規矩矩跟踪大淘氣入室的；這下邊的一條淡灰色，雖然也是個十分淘氣脚色的顏色，人却比較最文靜，有些紅樓夢裏小姐們的氣習，名呌紹華，她的令兄紹裘，是百忍莊智　之一，她的綫條，表示警備……」</p>
<p>守一像大學敎授似的，在這裏慢條斯理地講解各淘氣綫條的顏色和標示，剛說到這裏，忽地聽得外面起了槍聲，一共三個兩響，第一個「砰砰」起在正南，正是對準着這所房子的大門發出的；第二在正西，第三個兩響在正東。守一聽了，立刻一伸手，把　見腰下的二十修抽了去，一躍下了台階，在空地上，對上空開了四下，「砰，——砰砰砰——」這是約定了的平安　號。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>最近上海有一　影片，大個起颼，劇名是「璇宮艷后」（Caesar　and　Cleopatra）據說是蕭伯納編劇。朋友請我去看這張影片，我入塲不到十五分鐘，我　走了，</p>
<p>我明明知道這是一　戲，可以「逢塲作騰」的態度看　　，然而，我打心裏不喜歡輪，我不膩太勉強自己。</p>
<p>有許多人恭維蕭伯納是當世的太陽，我想如果太陽眞是這樣的話，我願意永遠在黑暗中生活。</p>
<p>沒有問題的這個老顯子自始至終在歪曲歷史。觀撒在他的筆下完全走了樣，我認不淸他所寫的應該是誰？同　我也沒有能力　理解　細子的騰默。</p>
<p>自然，我已經預料到，有許多「什麽家」們，會瞭　我的　　叢。</p>
<p>姑且從另一個角度來看　　吧！</p>
<p>對凱　，而且只對凱撒，那個死去的魔王墨索里尼　有一種眞正的宗敎的崇敬。他說：「凱撒之被刺是人類底不幸。」他又說：「我愛凱撒，他是一個亘古以來最偉大的人。人們要把他底朋友　比（當時的羅馬名將　執政官）盒綢口種　他；而　　　　他預儲下論靈的　鐵。他是一個　一的，　　　人　意志力　哲人　天才　人　。他骨子裏是一個哲學家，從永　　　　　　一切　東東西，　　，　　　　，　他　　心並不曾使他乖離了人情。」</p>
<p>另一次，他和一個外國朋友談起凱撒，他環臘一下，檢起一本放在他背後桌上的書，　了意大利文的莎士比亞底凱撤劇本開幕的數行。然後慢慢地把畫放回身子靠着肘上，一如他在哲學談話中所需要的沈　一樣的停頓了一下，他在作演　　的　　時是這種不作停頓的。他終於說：「可是，凱撒會　入陷阱，這是不可信的。」或問他是否指凱撒被害的那一幕，「自然。　　他不曉得陰謀者底一切　　？他的死，很可能的是他不知道往下怎麽辦，而自己有意找死。」</p>
<p>這種對凱撒奇異的解釋，和他一飲的對凱撒的愛，都是墨魔對人民大衆輕蔑的要素，這種輕　是他和凱撒所共有的。</p>
<p>「好就是壞，壞就是好。」偉大的伯納　啊！恕我聽不懂你幽默的惡作劇。</p>
<h3>告今之諾貝爾</h3>
<p>— 羅比</p>
<p>炸藥的發明雖然使諾貝爾大業吿成，立地致富，但是也成了他終生的憾事。因爲及後的用諸戰爭，使萬千生靈因而　炭，非他始料所及。原來炸藥係爲便利開鑛而研究，可是一待發明以後，竟被軍火商商用作最佳的出品，這作爲一個有其良知的科學家，怎不內疚於心？所以當諾貝爾行將與世吿別之時，他要將他所有的財產移充基金，獎勵學術，也特別提出一筆指定獎給對世界和平有偉大貢獻的世人，這是爲了瀰補他深心的不安與痛楚。</p>
<p>本來科學無罪，科學的目的也爲了造福人羣，但是因爲曾經助長或加深了戰爭的危害，因此到今天還要被人們斥爲萬惡。如美國科學家最近所發明的比原子彈更其可怕的「輻射性雲霧」和細菌戰爭，使我們戰慄不安者久之，記者先生渲染着這二種武器的驚人的畏力，同時指出在細　戰爭裏，已有三十三種細菌可以發生强大的效騐，這使我們從畏懼戰爭而畏懼至科學。</p>
<p>如果我們的科學者所孜孜研究的祇是怎樣去危害人類，我們眞要爲研究室中的白髮悲，也要爲科學哀。我們希望一個科學家在他高深的學問之外必須要有科學家的良知。諾貝爾終生的內疚還祇是別人的錯誤，而如果當前的科學家直接爲戰爭而服務，這更是科學的巨大的創痛。</p>
<p>所以，爲了人類的和平，我們要大聲極呼，今之世界的諾員爾先生們，請你們趕快住手！</p>
<h3>塘棲枇杷</h3>
<p>— 元璋</p>
<p>天堂附近的菓園裏，濃綠的枝頭上，已滿垂着金黄色的枇杷，以及鷄心形的桃子和靑色爽口的梅子。自塘棲西郊安磻鄕至丁河超山兩鄕，在梅花開放時，被稱爲三十里香雪海，現在連宏　鄕十里茂盛的枇杷林計算在內，這龐大的菓園，確有號稱四十里花菓塲的廣大。菓園中以枇杷產量爲最多，梅子次之，桃子產量最少。楷杷種類甚多，大致可分做，紅沙，白沙兩種，種植方法爲實生繁植法，未曾接枝的枇杷，稱作野種枇杷，接枝後始可定名爲本枝移接之某種枇把，枇杷樹的壽命最高約六十年，最低僅二十餘年，又枇杷成熟時，最怕陽光强烈的天氣，因枇杷被　後即僵，損失極大。</p>
<p>新由樹上摘下枇把，其味汁之鮮甜，所謂「樹頭鮮」的枇杷果汁，皮破即溢，與採下經時的枇杷滋味，實不可同日而語。上海梅林公司，亦在塘　設立分廠，以極新鮮的枇杷裝置罐頭內，用科學方法保持此極鮮美的「樹頭鮮」佳味，運往京滬及國外等地，供給遠地的仕女們本受此名果美味。而鄰近的杭，嘉，湖等地的人士，亦不乏專程到這座　　園裏來吃枇杷的，他們　着身子在枇杷林裏儘量的剝着枇杷吃，食量好的可以吃到五市斤光景，吃飽了枇杷再過了一息去用膳，仍不會减少原來的飯量。因爲枇杷的菓肉最鬆軟，並含有很豐富的糖汁，所以極容易消化。</p>
<p>我們下鄕去吃批杷的時候，鄕人們天眞的對我們講着日本人吃枇杷的故事：日本人把汽艇停靠枇杷林的岸邊，走上來把枇杷連枝幹攀折下來，臨走時在樹下放了幾籍火油，樹上掛了許多毛巾襪子之類，鄕人們雖心痛枇杷樹枝被折斷，樹將枯萎，但卻也感謝他們遺留下價値更多的物品；可是頭腦簡單的鄕人，那裏知道，日本人所遺留下來的東西，是從老百姓商店中擄掠來的呢？</p>
<h3>名曲介紹</h3>
<p>— 蘇爾維姬之歌　（Solvejy's　Song）</p>
<p>這是挪威大作曲家格拉格（Grieg）爲易卜生的著名五幕幻想劇「皮厄庚特」（Peer　Gynt）中配樂的揷曲，格拉格把爲該劇所作的配樂改編兩套組曲，那就是非常有名的「皮厄庚特組曲」，蘇爾維姬之歌編入第二套組曲中，是一首哀感動人的美麗的女高音獨唱曲。</p>
<p>蘇爾維姬之歌是一首春日之歌，當浪子皮厄庚特（男主角）遺棄了他底妻子蘇爾維姬出走了以後，她依然住在挪威森林中的一間小屋裏，滿懷　　與希望盼望她底丈夫歸來，這時候她已是一個中年的婦人了。當她坐着紡織的時侯，她願望她的丈夫一定會隨着美麗的春天一同歸來，而唱了這首哀艷欲絕的歌曲。歌調如下：</p>
<p>冬天不久留，春天要離開，春天要離開；</p>
<p>夏天花會謝，秋天葉要衰，秋天葉要衰；</p>
<p>縱時間無情，我相信你會來，我相信你會來。</p>
<p>我始終不渝，朝朝暮暮地等待。</p>
<p>每天早禱時，我祝你平安，我祝你平安；</p>
<p>每夜晚禱時，我祝你康健，我祝你康健；</p>
<p>待黑暗過去，光明總會出現，光明總會出現。</p>
<p>我死心塌地希望你有歸來的一天。</p>
<h3>拍照不容易</h3>
<p>— 果</p>
<p>做父親的人：你們拍兒童照片是多少價錢？</p>
<p>攝影師：兩萬元「一打」。</p>
<p>做父親的人：那末我再隔兩年可以來拍了，我現在有「十個」孩子。</p>
<h3>後魏之安集策　讀史雜記之二</h3>
<p>— 蕭黛</p>
<p>由於傳統的種族觀念根深蒂固地活在每個人的思想里，種族間的彼此歧視是必然的現象。因此歷來的討伐殺戮，就作爲一種政治手段不斷地繼續着。翻開一部中國史，大部分的篇幅是漢族征討異族，或是異族入寇漢族的記載。</p>
<p>爲戰爭所受苦的是人民，被屠戮的也是人民；而趁這機會擾民與任意搜刮的却是官吏。正由於這緣故，種族間的仇恨就越變越深刻，距離也就越遠了。</p>
<p>自後魏（南北朝）的政權樹立以後，世祖看到自己的官吏挾着主人的勢力任意搜刮蹂躪，種族間的仇隙加深，絕不是辦法，於是便開始厲行安集之策，移種族間的仇恨爲種族間的容忍。隨即着手於禁止官吏擾民，與獎勵耕作這兩種工作的實施。</p>
<p>世祖太平眞君四年（公元四四三年）六月庚寅，下過這樣的詔：</p>
<p>「朕承天子民，憂慮萬國，欲令百姓家給人足，興於禮養。而收守令宰，不能助朕宣揚恩德，動恤民隱，至乃侵奪其產，加以殘虐，非所以爲治也。今復民貲賦三年，其田租歲　如常。牧守之徒，各　精　治，勸課桑，不得妄有征發。有司彈糾，勿有所縱」。</p>
<p>禁止官吏擾民，這是實施安集策的一個消極辦法，積極的乃在於勸課農桑，增加生產。</p>
<p>實行勸課晨桑的具體辦法，第一是確定戶籍，然後再均分田畝。確定戶籍，政府可以便於管理人民的居住，確定每年的收入；然後按照所定戶籍均分田畝。在多年的戰亂之後，能够使人民安居樂業，無分種族相處一起，人民自不會再生仇恨之心。</p>
<p>這以後，後魏諸帝由安集漢族而漸漸興漢族同和起來。例　複姓之改爲單姓，異族興漢族之通婚，「不得以北俗之語言於朝廷」，以及採漢官制，禁止胡　等等。這樣的政策非但消彌了仇恨，而且進一步的團結一起了。</p>
<p>以目前的情形而論，後魏的這種安集同和之策，還是有着可以給我們採取與做法的地方在。</p>

<h3>廢除肉刑</h3>
<p>— 生泊</p>
<p>五月二十六日，蘇聯明令刻除死刑，並且規定：從今以後，凡根據現行法應處死刑的罪行，在和平時期中，都採用感化勞動營中刑期二十五年的監禁。消息報以「和平事業是安全無慮的」道理，解釋廢除死刑令的意義。勞動報和外次維辛斯基說：這是歷史性的法令，這是人道主義的空前勝利。</p>
<p>的確，廢除死刑是合乎人道主義的。但，死刑之廢止，就不能說是蘇聯空前的創造。</p>
<p>中國歷史，也有過廢除肉刑的時期。漢文帝十三年曾下詔廢肉刑，有曰：「蓋聞有處之時，盡衣冠，異章服以爲戮，而民弗犯，何治之至也。今有肉刑三而姦不止，其咎安在？非乃朕德之薄而敎不明與？吾甚自愧。夫訓道不純，而愚民陷焉，詩曰：愷弟君子。民之父母。今人有過，敎未施而刑已加焉。或欲改行爲善，而道繇至。朕其憐之。夫刑至斷支體，刻飢膚。終身不息，何其刑之痛而不得也。豈稱爲民父母之意哉？其除肉刑，有以易之」。</p>
<p>漢文帝不僅講人道，並且重敎化；可惜一治一亂之後，肉刑又恢復了。蘇聯在和平時期廢除肉刑，還不是最高的和平理想。</p>
<p>人類最高理想，是沒有肉刑，沒有刑罰，乃至沒有戰爭！</p>
<h3>說甘地</h3>
<p>— 力平</p>
<p>我國駐印大使羅家倫博士訪問甘地後，對記者發表談話稱：「渠偉大，甚偉大，除此余不能言他」。的確，「偉大」兩個字，聖雄甘地當之而無愧。</p>
<p>提起甘地，馬上我們頭腦中泛起這樣的印象：一個　癟瘦弱的老頭子，披一件袈裟樣的衣服，一架紡車，一頭山羊，這是他底全部的財產。而他就以這一點可憐的本錢，憑着一股浩然之氣，與號稱「日不沒國」的犬英帝國抗衡。沒有武器，不用暴力，億萬的印度民衆跟在他後面跑，數度入獄不能稍變他底信仰，幾次絕食竟然不死，最後不獨全印度民衆受他底精神的感召，全世界人士也震驚他底毅力。假如世間有「奇蹟」的話，印度獨立無疑是一種「奇蹟」：假如世間有「神」的話，甘地無疑是「神」的化身。</p>
<p>他與羅大使底一段談話中，含有哲學的意味。「甘地喩印度公衆之騷動，如恒河之流水，表面之泥沙，必將沉澱，其水終可呈現一片澄淸之色」。（中央社新德里廿八日電）這幾句話我們看了，眞是「別有一番滋味在心頭」。中印兩大古文明國家，百年來遭遇到同樣的命運，　在印度的「印回」之爭，和我國國內的騷亂有相似之處。印哲甘地已經指出「恒河泥沙，必將沉澱，終可呈現澄淸之色」。我們黄河底泥沙呢？我們相信也有沉澱而澄淸的一天。</p>

<p>「好，多謝你！那末就讓他們先到河池吧！因爲其中有一個是病人，急着要進醫院。」老祝覺得與其讓蘭在卡軍上長途馳　，還不如讓她早一些獲得適當治療的有益。他爲了答謝那司機的盛意起見，就打襯衫口袋裏抽出了人家不久以前送給他的一支犀飛利鋼筆來。「王司機，可是我不能讓你白當差，你又不一定肯拿我的錢。那末，這支筆送給你做個紀念吧！」</p>
<p>那個司機本來也不存奢望，再　那支　　光　　的全像新的一樣，估量也　幾萬塊錢，便笑嘻嘻的接了過去。</p>
<p>「那末，請你們快一些，再隔一個　頭我們就要開了！」這孫當然是算定局了。</p>
<p>祝兆年若有所失地摸了摸已經空了的襯衫口袋，立刻招待盧張二人快走；他的脚步跨得那麽的大，使跛着一足走路的盧前簡直跟不上去，張昌連跳帶跑勉强保持跟他常差兩三步的距離。</p>
<p>「可是，誰伴胡太太去呢？」半路上他向老祝這樣問。</p>
<p>「當然是你！我決不能離開了大夥　走。」毫不思索的回答。「小張，你大槪總肯帮我一次忙吧？那邊醫院的主任旣然是你的叔叔，就祇有請你一起去最妥當了！」</p>
<p>「行！行！行！」張昌不住口的答應。但他又想到了另一件事：「可是，緋緋怎麽樣呢？」</p>
<p>這是一件需要考慮的事，直到他們走進那家小茶館，老祝心裏還沒有打定主意，他覺得祇有讓闌自己決定了。</p>
<p>蘭仍然平臥在靠爐灶的一隅的地上，兩三位好心的女團員坐在她的旁邊，排緋也靜靜地靠在一位女團員的身上，紅着兩個小眼圈，什麼話也不說，儘用手撫弄着那一頭銅製的兎子。</p>
<p>老　三個人一走進小茶館，大家便立刻擁上來，打聽車子的消息。</p>

<h3>Discussion of Peace Proposals to be Presented at Today's Meeting; Conference to Adjourn Tonight After Electing Resident Committee Members</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] The review of the peace proposals was completed at 11:00 AM on the 1st. The Special Review Committee held its first meeting on the evening of the 31st, preliminarily deciding on the principles for drafting review opinions and designating personnel to draft the resolution of review opinions. This drafting committee convened on the morning of the 1st, engaging in careful discussions and adding details. It was then submitted to the second meeting of the Special Review Committee at 8:00 PM for discussion. Mr. Hu Jianzhong chaired the meeting. After thorough discussion, a conclusion was reached and the meeting adjourned at around 11:00 PM. Many members spoke extensively during the meeting, and the discussions were heated. Mr. Han Fu'e had raised issues related to student protests and newspapers, but they were rejected. Ultimately, the draft of the drafting committee was slightly revised in wording and passed, scheduled for discussion at the general meeting on the 2nd.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] The full text of the review opinions on the various peace proposals decided by the Special Review Committee of the Political Consultative Conference on the evening of the 1st is as follows:</p>
<p>We have listened attentively to Chairman Chiang of the National Government's address at the opening of this conference on May 20th, stating "to seek the realization of peaceful unification with unwavering determination." Furthermore, we have also listened to Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan's political report to this conference, which also reiterated "regarding the CCP issue, the government is determined to pursue peace, sparing no effort to compromise and tolerate, and adhering to its original intention of a political solution." We are deeply gratified. At the same time, the 20 proposals related to the peace issue submitted by members of this conference, although differing in form, all share a profound understanding of the suffering of the people and the desire for peaceful unification. As the highest representative body of public opinion in the country, this conference should echo the calls of the people, make consistent efforts, and contribute peace strategies to the government and the CCP on behalf of the people. As long as we follow the path of peace and engage in sincere negotiations, it will not be difficult to overcome the current difficulties. We should understand the people's desire for relief from war and aspire for governance, and make appeals that meet the needs and can be implemented immediately. Therefore, based on the spirit of the proposals of the members of this conference, we summarize the following points, hoping for their rapid realization: (1) Request the government to reiterate to China and foreign countries its continued commitment to the policy of "resolving the CCP issue through political means." (2) Request the CCP to promptly send representatives to Nanjing to resume peace talks with the government unconditionally. Based on the principles of "political democratization and nationalization of the military," actively research, discuss, and rapidly implement these principles. (3) After the closure of this conference, the presidium and resident committee of this conference shall continue to strive for the promotion of peace in the spirit of the resolutions of this conference.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] The fourth session, third meeting, of the Political Consultative Conference is scheduled to hold its closing ceremony on the afternoon of the 2nd. By the afternoon of the 1st, nearly 400 proposals had been passed at this conference, with fewer than 100 remaining. It is expected that the remaining proposals will be discussed and completed at the general meeting on the morning and afternoon of the 2nd. The peace plan formulated by the Special Review Committee will also be presented at the morning session on the 2nd. After holding the general meeting in the afternoon, the closing ceremony will be held immediately. The chairman presiding over the closing ceremony is planned to be Wu Yifang.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] All councilors are scheduled to visit the Mausoleum of Sun Yat-sen on the morning of the 3rd. The Councilors' Association is scheduled to hold a dinner gathering at the Great Hall on the 2nd.</p>
<p>[Report from Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Political Consultative Conference will continue to hold general meetings on the morning and afternoon of the 2nd to discuss proposals and elect resident committee members. After the afternoon meeting, the conference will adjourn immediately without holding a separate closing ceremony.</p>
<h3>Military and Police Entering Lushun and Dalian: Sino-Soviet Negotiations Continue; Foreign Minister Wang Answers Questions from Councilors</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] During the foreign affairs report on the 22nd of the Political Consultative Conference, councilors Wang Weixin and Wang Yuyang, among others, raised questions regarding the recovery of Lushun and Dalian and Dalian's access to the sea. Foreign Minister Wang submitted a written response on the 1st, stating in brief: "Over the past year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has strived to ensure the strict implementation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance by both sides. The Soviet side has announced the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops that entered the Northeast provinces during the war in May of last year. Regarding our recovery of Lushun and Dalian, we have repeatedly consulted with the Soviet side in the past two months. The Soviet side has expressed its willingness to assist us in the recovery work, but opinions on the entry of our military and police into Lushun and Dalian have not yet fully aligned. We have now decided to first send an inspection team by warship to Dalian for inspection. At the same time, we will continue to consult with the Soviet government on the points where our opinions still differ, in order to achieve a solution in the near future. As for the question of the CCP using Dalian to obtain arms supplies, the government has paid close attention and will take necessary measures upon verification."</p>
<h3>Lushun and Dalian Inspection Team to Depart from Shenyang Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Shenyang Office, 1st] The Lushun and Dalian inspection team, consisting of ten members plus staff, is scheduled to depart from Shenyang by train on the 2nd, heading south to a certain port, and then transfer to our warship to Lushun and Dalian.</p>
<p>[Report from Our News Desk] Our reporter interviewed Mr. Wang Zhengting yesterday, asking for his opinion on the proposal in the Political Consultative Conference to amend the Sino-Soviet Treaty. Mr. Wang declined to give a direct answer, only saying that such major issues should be considered calmly, otherwise it would increase the difficulties for those in charge.</p>
<h3>We Continue to Collect Information on Dismantled Industrial Equipment</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] In Foreign Minister Wang's written response to the Political Consultative Conference on the 1st, the issue of the Soviet Union's removal of factory equipment from the Northeast was addressed. This case was raised by councilors Wang Guoyuan and Liang Shangdong. According to the response: "Regarding the Soviet army's removal of factory machinery and equipment during their stay in the Northeast, this Ministry has repeatedly declared our solemn position to the Soviet side. We disagree with the Soviet side's view that some Japanese industrial assets in the Northeast should be treated as war booty by the Soviet army, as it exceeds the scope recognized by international law and international custom. Therefore, we have repeatedly expressed our disagreement. The UK and the US also agree with our position. We are now contacting the relevant authorities and conducting investigations and collecting various data as the basis for continued negotiations."</p>
<h3>US Military Extraterritoriality Case Reserved After Vote</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] During the discussion of proposals related to judicial administration at the Political Consultative Conference on the afternoon of the 1st, the proposal by Chen Yaodong that "US military personnel in China should obey Chinese law and requesting the National Government to explicitly abolish the 'Regulations on Handling Criminal Cases of US Military Personnel in China' to restore national sovereignty" sparked a heated debate. When explaining this case, Mr. Chen pointed out that during the War of Resistance Against Japan, for the sake of facilitating joint operations, our government had promulgated the "Regulations on Handling Criminal Cases of US Military Personnel in China" in October of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], with its validity period stipulated to end six months after the end of the joint operations. Subsequently, the National Government explicitly extended it for another year on March 3rd of last year. During this year, criminal cases of US military personnel infringing upon the Chinese people have been numerous. However, the US military courts have disregarded Chinese public opinion and anger, and even declared the defendants not guilty. That foreigners committing crimes in the host country should be subject to the laws of that country is a major principle of international law. The application of the regulations during the joint operations of the two countries was originally an unavoidable expedient measure. Now, a considerable period has passed since the end of the war, but the regulations are still applied as usual, which not only infringes upon our sovereignty but also sets a bad precedent in international law. Therefore, the regulations should be explicitly abolished. He further explained that the method would be: to request the National Government to immediately abolish the Regulations on Handling Criminal Cases of US Military Personnel in China and to notify the US government to inform its personnel in China that they should immediately obey Chinese law.</p>
<p>Convener Jiang Yiping refuted from a legal point of view, pointing out that according to international law, troops stationed in foreign countries should enjoy extraterritorial rights. For example, if our country were to station troops in Japan in the future, it would also enjoy such privileges. This matter is of great importance and should be reserved for further consideration. Others also stood up to speak. In the end, after a vote, according to the review opinion, the case was reserved.</p>
<h3>Regulation of Commercial Banks Discussed at the Political Consultative Conference Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] Whether the government should relax the restrictions on commercial banks, still adhering to a strict policy, was also one of the topics debated at the Political Consultative Conference on the afternoon of the 1st. Those in favor of strictly regulating commercial banks included Chen Gengya and Wu Wangji, among others. Mr. Chen believed that many commercial banks and money shops approved by the Ministry of Finance during the War of Resistance Against Japan sprang up like mushrooms after rain, establishing branches everywhere. Those with insufficient capital relied on absorbing large amounts of deposits and channeling them into speculative markets to engage in illegal businesses, searching and seizing materials everywhere, stimulating prices, hoarding, and monopolizing the market. If they are not regulated, the danger is unimaginable. Wu Wangji also believed that commercial banks are the main base of bureaucratic capital and should be strictly regulated, which may also be a way to support legitimate banking. Those holding the opposite view included Wang Guanying, among others. Wang believed that banks and money shops that had suspended operations due to the War of Resistance should be allowed to resume business. Wang Dequan also suggested that the Ministry of Finance should relax the restrictions on provincial banks and commercial banks, allowing them to establish institutions in various places in order to develop local economic finance. During the discussion, due to conflicting review opinions, Luo Heng raised questions, hoping that the meeting would have a consistent position on the regulation of commercial banks and that it should be consistent with the past tightening policies advocated by the Political Consultative Conference. It was decided that the five cases related to the regulation of commercial banks would be resubmitted to the Fourth Review Committee for review. The committee is scheduled to meet on the evening of the 1st, and the results of the review are expected to be presented to the general meeting on the 2nd.</p>
<h3>National Constitutionalism Society Issues Opinions on the Current National Situation</h3>
<p>[Report from Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The National Constitutionalism Society is an organization formed by representatives to the National Assembly, with branches throughout the country and tens of thousands of members. Recognizing the seriousness of the current situation, they have issued for the first time "Opinions on the Current National Situation," first stating the desire and need for peace by the people and the government. When reviewing the responsibility for the war, the article stated that the government had made final efforts after each failed peace talk and hoped to send Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an in person to try to break the final deadlock. To this day, the government has repeatedly stated that it will resolve the issue through political means, while the CCP still insists on its two conditions. It is very clear which side is closing the door to negotiations. Secondly, in fact, the CCP-occupied areas are continuing to expand their military without limit, preparing for a long-term, large-scale civil war. We can only create an atmosphere of peace in the government-controlled areas and shout slogans against conscription and civil war, but who has ever heard of anyone in the CCP area opposing their actions? Who does not need peace? Who is resolutely engaged in civil war? The ultimate goal of the CCP is to attempt to drag down the government through a long-term civil war. Making peace with the CCP is tantamount to seeking skin from a tiger. The Chinese civil war has an international background, which CCP's Zhou Enlai has openly admitted. In the past, the CCP had no military force in the Northeast. Now, not only does it have one, but it is still able to launch large-scale offensives after each defeat. Fierce battles are currently taking place in Shandong. Where does the military supplies come from, and Mongolians and Koreans are also participating in the Communist army in the Northeast. Understanding these facts can reveal the true picture of the Chinese civil war today. The article concluded that if our understanding is correct, today's problem is no longer a domestic problem, and the core issue is not the issue of war and peace, but whether to have a motherland or not. We believe that solving the civil war requires improving and reforming domestic affairs, but the key still lies in diplomacy, which is the correct approach to reality. So-called peace talks are like climbing a tree to catch fish. We acknowledge that the sincere and pure youth who voiced such calls did so out of love for the country and the people. However, if adults with political minds also make such claims, it is either foolishness or ulterior motives. We have this confidence and are willing to teach the people of the country with it. We hope that all people across the country who truly love the country and the people will rise up and vigorously supervise the improvement of politics and correct the errors in foreign policy.</p>
<h3>Issue of Pardoning Traitors: Heated Debate at the Political Consultative Conference, Original Proposal Reserved After Final Vote</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] The issue of pardoning traitors sparked a heated debate at the Political Consultative Conference when it met on the afternoon of the 1st. Legal experts such as Jiang Yiping, Yan Shumo, and Zhang Shizhao cited classics and displayed their eloquence. The National Assembly Hall almost became a courtroom of the High Court, which was also one of the great stories of this conference. This heated debate was caused by Zhang Bangzhen's criticism of Zhang Shizhao's proposal. Zhang's proposal requested the government to expand the scope of amnesty, so that all crimes committed before the end of the 35th year of the Republic [1946], except for killing direct relatives and war criminals, would be handled separately in accordance with the two categories of the amnesty decree, A and C, in order to show leniency and usher in a new beginning. Zhang Bangzhen believed that if traitors were also included in the amnesty, wouldn't it encourage future generations to become traitors? It would be absolutely impermissible, and the review opinion actually said that its "intentions are good," which is really inconceivable. Convener Jiang Yiping explained that the intention of the original proposal was to enable people in the occupied areas who were forced to collaborate with the enemy to be given leniency and reduced punishment, because they were mostly small flies who had no choice but to be dragged into the water. Now, nearly a million people are imprisoned, while big traitors are able to roam free. Wouldn't this encourage everyone to become a big traitor when a third world war breaks out? Zhang Bangzhen retorted that the conveners of the review committee were all lawyers, so were they defending the traitors? Zhao Shu, Wu Chunwu, and others also stood up to speak, advocating that the government should severely punish major traitors such as Zhou Fohai and Ding Mocun. Finally, the original proposer, Zhang Shizhao, was publicly invited to explain, and the entire audience listened to the eloquent words of this generation of legal scholars with a feeling of watching a good show. Zhang pointed out with a compassionate tone that, according to statistics, there are no fewer than a million people nationwide who are suspected of being traitors, and their daughters alone number at least two million. The descendants of traitors are also citizens of the Republic of China, and many are engaged in patriotic work. Simply because their fathers and brothers were unworthy, they have no face to see the world. If we put them all in the list of shame, it would not only affect history but also affect the future of the nation. Even in general, the common traitors were just fellow countrymen who failed to move west with the government at the time, and drifted into the occupied areas, reaching two hundred million people. A small number of those people who collaborated with the enemy were forced to do so. The government's underground work relied heavily on them. It would be unfair and unreasonable not to grant them amnesty, hence this proposal. After Zhang finished speaking, Zhang Bangzhen and others still disagreed. In the end, after a vote, the original proposal was reserved.</p>
<h3>16th Meeting of the Political Consultative Conference Passes Proposal to Organize Taiwan Comfort Mission; Northeast Inspection Team to Depart Within Three Weeks</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] At the 16th meeting of the Political Consultative Conference on the morning of the 1st, two proposals to organize a Taiwan Investigation and Comfort Mission and a Northeast Inspection Team by the Political Consultative Conference were passed, and the Resident Committee was tasked with handling them promptly.

(6) All systems, personnel, policies, and administration shall be the content to be inspected.

(8) The expenses of this team shall be drafted by this conference as a special project and requested to be allocated by the government. (9) This team shall be responsible to this conference, etc.</p>
<h3>Kong Geng's Humorous Proposal: Requesting Treatment for China's Current Three Major Diseases, Resolution Sent to the Government for Serious Attention</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Nanjing Office, 1st] The title of Kong Geng's proposal is "Requesting Prompt Treatment for China's Current Three Major Diseases to Save the National Crisis." The so-called three major diseases are "democracy disease, economic disease, and military disease." The former is the root cause, and the latter two are symptomatic diseases. The root cause must be treated with a radical cure, and the symptomatic diseases must be treated with a palliative cure. The radical cure will take at least ten years, and the palliative cure will take at least three months. It also stated that the lack of democratic cultural knowledge is the disease of ignorance, the lack of democratic economic capacity is the disease of poverty, and the lack of democratic knowledge is that various parties recognize political parties as democracy, which is the disease of putting the cart before the horse. The whole text is extremely humorous. As a result of the discussion, it was sent to the government for serious attention.</p>
<h3>Jiang Yuntian and Others Arrive in Nanjing; Internal Strife in the Democratic Socialist Party Comes to an End</h3>

In addition, the newly elected government committee member Xu Chuanlin will come to Nanjing to take office after the National Government announces it.</p>

<h3>Proposal to Prohibit Commercial Dancing Referred to the Government for Consideration</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 1st] The proposal by Zhang Zhijiang and others, "Requesting the government to issue a general order to all provinces and cities strictly prohibiting commercial mixed-gender dancing to promote proper social customs and correct habits," was passed at the 16th session in the morning of the 1st and referred to the government for consideration. The fervent discussion of this proposal was the only interlude in this morning's meeting. Zhang Zhijiang, the original proposer of the motion, had previously submitted a "ban dancing" proposal during the Third Plenary Session, which was rejected. Now, he resubmitted it to the Senate. The review committee, after deliberation, believed that with social progress and young people's social interaction moving toward the right track, the proposal was unnecessary to recommend to the government, and therefore suggested "reservation." However, after it was presented at the general assembly on the 1st, Zhang Zhijiang spoke twice, explaining the importance of prohibiting commercial mixed-gender dancing. Subsequently, many others spoke, and the discussion lasted for a quarter of an hour. The atmosphere at the meeting became heated and tense. The main argument of the proposal was that Western customs are different, and Western dancing is completely incompatible with Chinese sentiments. It elaborated on the virtues of ancient Chinese ritual music, believing that "since the implementation of Western dancing in China, it has indeed fostered lewdness, not only squandering money but also destroying a sense of shame, corrupting morals, and causing numerous malpractices." "The matter of mixed-gender dancing, from a human perspective, should be absolutely prohibited. Mixed-gender dancing is not only a matter of giving and receiving but also increases intimacy and friction, not only removing preventative measures but also opening the door to convenience and indulging in carnal desires." When Zhang made his explanation, he loudly invoked the ancient teaching of "men and women should not touch hands when giving or receiving," explaining the issue of friction during dancing. Subsequently, Liao Xuezhuan also spoke, stating that "everyone is falling in love at the dance halls," vividly and dramatically, eliciting laughter from the audience. Although Fang Shaoyun, the convener, explained the review process and opinions, opinions in the meeting were clearly divided into two factions: one advocating for reservation, admiring Western civilization, and the other advocating for referring it to the government for consideration, harking back to history and praising China's inherent ritual music. In the end, it was put to a vote. The first vote, with 182 people present, resulted in 90 votes for referring it to the government, which should have been rejected due to it being a minority, but due to the majority of people believing that the count was incorrect and the report was inaccurate, a revote was requested. The result was that only 69 votes favored reservation, and the amended proposal was ultimately passed and referred to the government for consideration, concluding a storm and an interlude.</p>

<h3>Students in Nanjing, Shanghai, North China, and Other Places Decide to Cancel Parades Today and Suspend Strikes from Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 1st] The "Joint Student Association of the Five Regions of Nanjing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Henan" has decided to suspend strikes starting from the 3rd, and the planned parade on the 2nd has also been canceled. Representatives of the Student Association hosted journalists at the National Central University on the evening of the 1st to announce the above measures. According to Zhu Chengxue, the vice chairman of the standing committee of the National Central University Student Self-Government Association, the primary reason for the occurrence of this incident was insufficient communication between the government and students. He also stated that this student movement was no different from past student movements. Petitioning the government was a sign of trust in the government, and the demands raised were for the benefit of all students. As for the final occurrence of the incident, it was due to the inability of the Executive Yuan authorities and the police and military authorities to cooperate. They expressed hope that cooperation could be achieved in the future. As for the originally planned parade on the 2nd, it was in response to the parade called for by Peking University and did not consider the significance of the day. However, after persuasion from the authorities of various schools, the Legislative Yuan, and the Senate, the decision was made to stop it, but the originally raised demands will continue to be reasonably negotiated. Tomorrow at 2:00 PM, the Student Association will hold a "Anti-Civil War, Anti-Hunger, Anti-Atrocities" rally in the Great Hall of National Central University to mourn the compatriots who died in the civil war, and will invite legislators, senators, and professors from various schools to speak.</p>

The notice stated: "The naming ceremony was not reported to the school in advance, and the naming of the school buildings at will, as well as the raising of flags, is inappropriate. Students usually love the school, and it is hoped that they will be mindful of the environment and not act rashly."</p>

<h3>Hangzhou Takes Emergency Measures to Arrest Twelve Communist Party Members</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 1st] The Zhejiang Provincial Government has taken emergency measures to maintain social order in Hangzhou City and ensure the stability of the people, arresting twelve Communist underground members. Chairman Shen specially hosted journalists and made a statement, stating in brief: "Recently, the hidden elements of the Chinese Communist Party scattered throughout the rear areas have been instigating in various ways, attempting to strike, close markets, and strike in the 62nd, expanding the disaster. With conclusive evidence, this province, in order to comply with public opinion and ensure social order and the safety of the people, has had to take decisive measures, targeting and eradicating the hidden elements in the city. As of now, military and police agencies have arrested twelve people in order to eliminate harm and avoid the sacrifice of many pure young people being exploited by these individuals, placing the entire society in a state of unrest. However, the government will act with leniency and treat the arrested individuals favorably, hoping that they will thoroughly reflect and repent. If they can sincerely reform, they will be dealt with leniently and given an opportunity to rehabilitate. Those who are deeply poisoned and stubbornly unrepentant will have to be sent to the Chinese Communist Party-occupied areas for isolation. In the future, if any disruption of society occurs that is sufficient to harm social order, it will be dealt with strictly in accordance with the emergency measures for maintaining social order promulgated by the central government, and no tolerance will be shown. It is hoped that the media will promote just arguments, and parents will earnestly advise their children to understand right and wrong, abide by the law, cherish their future, and not be misled by heresies to engage in transgressions, resulting in being caught in the net of the law."</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Reflections on Borrowing from the United States</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the majority of the Political Consultative Council passed the proposal submitted by Jiang Yong and 80 others, "Please urge the government to quickly launch economic reconstruction work and quickly negotiate loans with the United States for construction purposes." The resolution of the case was sent to the government for quick handling. Furthermore, in order to ensure that the loan is used specifically for construction purposes and does not become bureaucratic capital, the General Assembly resolved that after the loan is established in the future, its use will be supervised by the public opinion organs. Since the promulgation of the Truman Doctrine in the United States, countries such as Greece and Turkey have successively received US economic assistance; even Korea, which is under military rule, has received promises of loans to seek its economic recovery. Our country was the vanguard of the Second World War, lasting for a long time and suffering especially heavy damage. Although the US government has allocated 500 million yuan to help our country's economic recovery, it has not yet been used. Now that the Political Consultative Council is meeting in the capital, the passage of this proposal by a majority is enough to reflect the general public's intention, that is, for the sake of our country's heavy economic construction, our government should immediately negotiate with the United States to use this $500 million loan. The so-called $500 million loan was already reserved by the US Export-Import Bank in April last year. It has been more than a year and it has not been realized. Now the deadline of the end of June is imminent. Therefore, standing in the position of the people, we cannot but express ourselves.</p>
<p>From our country's perspective, although Executive Yuan President Zhang, at the beginning of his tenure, had expounded his position, emphasizing self-reliance and unwilling to rely on foreign debt to make up for the overspending on the budget, he also stated at the same time that our country has a vast area that needs to immediately start economic recovery and construction work, and the expenses required for this kind of work are beyond the current capacity of our treasury. In this case, the US loan is of utmost importance. Therefore, foreign telegrams have repeatedly reported that the loan plan has been submitted to the United States. On the US side, Secretary of State Marshall also declared after returning from Moscow that China hopes to use a portion of the US's $500 million loan and has proposed several plans. Recently, it was reported that Secretary Marshall is now urging the early lending of some loans from the US Export-Import Bank to China to meet the urgent needs of its reconstruction work. At the same time, it has been repeatedly reported that the deadline at the end of June may be extended. Judging from these signs, it can be seen that both sides intend to promote this loan. Even if it may not be fully completed by the end of this month due to procedural reasons, the final result is not difficult to predict.</p>
<p>The reason is very simple. Economics has no national boundaries, and the decline of any part of the world will inevitably affect the rest. With the large population and large market of our country, and in the wake of this long-term war of resistance, with wounds all over the place and extremely low purchasing power, if we do not use methods such as credit or loans to provide adequate assistance, then any country that wants to promote its exports to promote trade between the two countries, thereby venting its high industrial production and maintaining its satisfactory employment situation, is indeed difficult to achieve. Now, the degree of economic damage in various countries after the war is far less than that of our country, but the lack of US dollars and the weakness of purchasing power have made it feel riddled with holes and unable to maintain its international balance, let alone our country, which has been in public and private distress for eight years of resistance?</p>
<p>Since the victory, the monthly customs statistics have clearly shown that the country with the largest import and export figures in our country is the United States. The original trade advantage with China has long been taken over by the United States from Britain and Japan. And now, the country that is relatively wealthy and can lend its surplus funds or materials to our country is undoubtedly only the United States. Therefore, even if the $500 million loan has not been realized before the end of June, it cannot but be extended appropriately to wait for the opportunity to mature. This relationship is not so much one-sided to China as it is mutually beneficial to China and the United States. Anyone with a long-term vision and a deep understanding of the country can see this. Therefore, the reason why US loans today are only lip service and not actual is not in the United States but in China. This is worth our deep reflection.</p>
<p>What has become a problem today is the issue of conditions on the US side, that is, the so-called loan plan, and the issue of use in our country, that is, how to prevent waste and corruption. Now the Political Consultative Council has designated the use as the rapid launch of economic reconstruction work, specifically for construction purposes, and has also resolved that the use will be supervised by public opinion organs. Concerns about waste and corruption can at least be expected to have concrete measures to prevent them. This may also be helpful to the plan required by the US. Because whether the use is proper, whether the expenses are excessive, and whether the people who will be in charge of using the loan in the future will be corrupt are of course the most important points that creditors pay attention to. Once the key points are resolved, the rest can be easily solved.</p>
<p>We are not afraid of the cost here and want to remind everyone to pay attention to the government's ability and efficiency in implementing policies. Because economic construction and reconstruction work are very broad terms. After the war, everything is waiting to be done, but we hope to distinguish the urgency and start with items that are essential to people's livelihood. Those that are grandiose, decorate the facade, or are intended to vent surplus goods should be avoided as much as possible to avoid increasing unnecessary burdens. As for the most urgent and most important economic problem now, it is no more than stabilizing the currency value. If the currency value is unstable, then the price cannot be stabilized, and thus wages, interest rates, foreign exchange, production, import and export, people's lives, and even national finance and social order can hardly be stabilized. Does this loan include a foreign exchange fund? If it is included, what percentage does it account for? This is especially worth paying close attention to. However, since this loan is mainly used for reconstruction, we may not be able to say that it does not have fiscal significance, but in name and meaning, it should mainly aim at the revival of our national economy. But no matter its nature and value, the main key is still the government's certainty and perseverance in implementing policies. If the government is hesitant about a certain policy, or undecided, thinks it is right in the morning and wrong in the evening, goes east today and west tomorrow, not only will it make the people at a loss, gradually develop the habit of despising government orders, but also international friends will feel that our government is wandering on a fork in the road, at a loss, how can we expect them to lend us huge sums of money? It must be known that economic construction after the war is not easy, let alone in a situation where there is destruction by the Communist Party on one side and restrictions by multiple parties on the other. Naturally, it is even more difficult.</p>
<p>Finally, when we review borrowing from the United States, we always believe that the United States should know the principle that "timely medicine can cure diseases and save people," while in our country, we should reflect deeply that only a strong and efficient government can gain the full trust of friendly countries.</p>

<h3>Japanese Three-Party Cabinet Formally Established Yesterday; Katayama Announces Policy Guidelines; Foreign Minister Ashida Calls for International Assistance</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] The list of cabinet members of the Katayama Cabinet was announced by the Cabinet Formation Headquarters at 7:20 PM on the 31st. Those who were in negotiations also agreed to join the cabinet. At 9:30 AM on the 1st, they gathered at the Prime Minister's residence, and at 10:10 AM, they went to the Imperial Palace. At 11:00 AM, with Prime Minister Katayama standing by, the Emperor's certification ceremony was held. (According to Japan's new constitution, the Japanese Emperor no longer holds the appointment ceremony for the new cabinet members, but instead holds the certification ceremony, because according to Articles 6 and 7 of the new constitution, the Japanese Emperor only has the right to appoint the Prime Minister based on the nomination of the Diet. As for the cabinet members, they are appointed by the Prime Minister, and the Japanese Emperor only performs a formal certification.) Prime Minister Katayama handed over the official seals to the ministers, and thus, the Katayama Cabinet was formally established. It has also been announced that Foreign Minister Ashida will concurrently serve as the Director of the Central Liaison Office, and Minister of State Wada will concurrently serve as the Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board and the Director-General of the Price Agency.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] The Katayama Cabinet held its first full cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's residence at 1:00 PM on the 1st and decided to announce the implementation guidelines for countermeasures to overcome the economic crisis in extraordinary times on the 2nd. After the meeting ended at 2:00 PM, Prime Minister Katayama and the cabinet members met with the press corps and announced the following policy guidelines.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Katayama said: The so-called democratic politics is not a formal human liberation, but must be accompanied by economic liberation; the most important thing for Japan at present is to overcome the food crisis. I believe that those who hold power represent the people and bear the heavy responsibility of administration, not to become a privileged class. As for the economic revolution, it was also implemented during the French Restoration. I intend to work hard to make our country (Japan) move towards the construction of a cultural nation. I originally intended to organize a coalition cabinet of various parties, and after many days of struggle, the result was still a three-party coalition cabinet, while the Liberal Party said that it would cooperate outside the cabinet. However, even though it is said to be a three-party coalition, the current cabinet is not entirely a mixed bag of the three parties, but has become a whole, and will cooperate to overcome the current crisis.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Ashida said: In order to stabilize the current national life, economic reconstruction is very important. The Japanese are indeed very observant of the Potsdam Declaration in order to improve their international status. Without the goodwill and assistance of foreign countries, it will definitely not be able to recover. The Japanese must become a peace-loving people, a people of a cultural nation that renounces war, and make other countries trust them.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Yano said: Regarding Japan's future fiscal policy, the focus will be on the following matters: (1) The freezing of new Japanese yen will not be considered, nor will the suspension of interest payments on government bonds be considered. (2) Implement the necessary financial control policies: Since the implementation of the tight loan policy in March, important industries have also fallen into a state of financial difficulty. The current low-price policy is also due to the insufficient purchasing power of the people. Therefore, we cannot but consider the tendency of currency contraction. In short, the regulations on loans for important industries will be relaxed again to increase production. (3) Prevent currency inflation; heavy taxes will be levied on improper profits obtained due to currency inflation and the black market, but no new taxes have been considered for this purpose. (4) In the policy agreement, prices and wages will be strongly controlled. Regarding wages, it is hoped that labor and management will hold management consultation meetings to increase production based on this.</p>
<p>Commerce Minister Mizutani said: In order to overcome the economic crisis, Japan has carried out excessive currency and financial countermeasures, which have slowed down the recovery of production. I believe that the recovery of production is the most important thing. It is planned that important industries such as coal, fertilizer, electricity, and ships will be managed by the state in the future. The first is the nationalization of the coal industry and the reorganization of mining areas. The compensation is believed to be in the form of equipment rather than products. Minister of State Hirano Chen said: I had previously hoped to distribute three servings of food (per person per day), but since I took office as minister, I feel that this move cannot be implemented immediately. However, I plan to work hard to solve the food problem. I will form a food adjustment committee to make it easier to obtain food, and establish a national fertilizer committee, and I hope to implement the management of fertilizer in the future.</p>
<h3>Japanese New Cabinet Plans to Implement Scorched Earth Policy Against Communism</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 1st] Prime Minister Katayama declared to the Japanese press corps today that the new government will be consistent and will not engage in hypocrisy. Regarding specific policies, they must be discussed with the cabinet members before they can be decided, and there is nothing to say for the time being. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had previously issued a statement in Katayama's name, saying that the new cabinet plans to implement a scorched earth policy against communism.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 1st] Japanese Prime Minister Katayama today denied that he has a communist background and issued a formal statement, guaranteeing that the new cabinet will take a moderate line that is neither left nor right. Katayama said: "Based on the spirit of the new Japanese constitution, I have formed a new cabinet today. I sincerely regret that we were unable to obtain the participation of the Liberal Party in the cabinet. The new cabinet will adopt a moderate line based on the policies agreed upon by the four parties (including the Liberal Party) on May 16th, neither leaning to the left nor to the right, and especially clearly opposing communism. Therefore, I hope that the Liberal Party will cooperate with the government in this regard. I firmly believe that with the unanimous cooperation of the Japanese people and the goodwill assistance of the Allied nations, Japan will be able to overcome all difficulties."</p>
<h3>Japan to Establish Ministry of Labor</h3>
<p>But it still needs to be passed by the current Diet</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] The post of Minister of State and Minister of Labor has been announced in the new Katayama Cabinet, but the establishment of the Ministry of Labor is only a plan of the Socialist Party. According to the new Minister of State, Mitsuaki Yonekubo, he has exchanged views with Minister of Health and Welfare, Sadakichi Ichimatsu, on the issue of establishing the Ministry of Labor. All preparations for the establishment of the Ministry of Labor are also completely the responsibility of the Ministry of Health and Welfare. In the future, some of the business of the Ministry of Health and Welfare will be transferred to the management of the Ministry of Labor, but it still needs to be passed by the current Diet before there is a legal basis.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Report: Ryukyu Elections Postponed</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 1st] According to MacArthur's third report on the military government of the Ryukyu Islands, which was released today, the Ryukyu elections have been postponed pending the completion of the repatriation work and the resettlement of returning people. However, he also said that the people of the various islands have made great progress in uniting into a political unit. The people of the Ryukyu Islands are reopening their damaged land and learning modern agricultural and industrial methods under the supervision of the US military government. MacArthur estimates that the Ryukyu Islands can only produce half of the food needed this year, but industrial recovery can make satisfactory progress in areas where raw materials can be obtained.</p>
<h3>US Youth Must Receive Military Training</h3>
<p>Universal Military Training Committee Recommends to Congress</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] The Universal Military Training Committee appointed by Truman yesterday strongly urged Congress to pass a universal military training bill as an urgent military need to defend the United States against aggression and to achieve peace in the current dangerous world. The committee, led by Dr. Compton of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, unanimously recommended after six months of meticulous research that all able-bodied men who have reached the age of eighteen or have completed secondary education should receive six months of basic military training, and then choose one of the three services of the army, navy, and air force for advanced training. If the recommendation of the Universal Military Training Committee is passed, then 750,000 to 900,000 young people will be trained each year within a few years.</p>
<h3>Los Angeles-Shanghai Air Route Resumes</h3>
<p>First Plane to Take Off from the US on the 3rd</p>
<p>[United Press, Los Angeles, 31st] Pan American Airlines announced on the 31st that the air route between Los Angeles and Shanghai operated by the company will resume on June 3rd (the route has been suspended since December 7, 1941). The entire flight will only take 50 hours. The Consul General of China in Los Angeles will lead overseas Chinese to the airport to watch the first passenger plane of the route take off.

These weather stations will be operated in cooperation with American personnel and Catholic priests.</p>
<h3>New Delhi Under Extraordinary Security; Round Table Conference Opens Today; Indian Governor-General to Announce Plan for Transfer of Power</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] London, May 1 (Broadcast): Indian authorities have taken emergency precautions to prevent riots during the Round Table Conference to be held on Monday between Governor-General Mountbatten and Indian leaders. The British proposal remains secret, but close advisors to Mountbatten are certain that whatever the content of the proposal, its announcement will inevitably trigger new bloodshed between Indians and Muslims, as both sides seek to seize power after Britain's withdrawal from India. On Saturday, police teams searched for weapons everywhere, and mixed teams of Indian and Muslim military police were deployed in various locations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, May 1] Governor-General Mountbatten formally invited five major Indian political leaders last night to meet with him tomorrow, where he will report on the British government's plan for the transfer of power in India. The five invited leaders are Vice President of the Interim Government of India, Nehru; Home Minister Patel (both from the Congress Party); President of the All-India Muslim League, Jinnah; Finance Minister Ali Khan (both from the Muslim League); and Defense Minister Singh (leader of the Sikh community). Starting today, Delhi police will carry automatic weapons and maintain tight security throughout the city. In the troubled areas of the Punjab province and other provinces, military police will also step up security to prevent major riots during the Delhi conference.</p>
<h3>Auchinleck Rushes Back to India</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Karachi, April 30] Field Marshal Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army, arrived here today from London and immediately proceeded to New Delhi.</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, April 30] The situation in India is extremely tense. Reliable sources say that arms are being smuggled into India from Burma and Afghanistan, and large numbers of jeeps are being purchased and driven to various provinces of India. Some princely states are hoarding large quantities of arms, and most princely states already possess large armies and large amounts of surplus wartime equipment. It is rumored that some religious sects are encouraging the organization of private armies. Military police in Calcutta have completed security measures throughout the city, and troops in Bombay have also been deployed to areas where recent Indian-Muslim conflicts have occurred.</p>
<h3>The Moment of Decisive Destiny Approaches</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Special Dispatch, New Delhi, April 30] With the return of Governor-General Mountbatten to New Delhi, the moment of decisive destiny for India has arrived. Senior figures from the two major Indian parties are now discussing the British plan for the transfer of power. The outline of the plan has reportedly been submitted to both parties. The Standing Committee of the Congress Party met this afternoon, and the Standing Committee of the Muslim League is scheduled to meet tomorrow. Leaders from relevant provinces of both sides will also participate in the discussions. It is generally believed that Mountbatten may hold a press conference on the 5th to announce the plan for the transfer of power. Currently, the main difficulty for Indian parties remains the question of unity or division. Therefore, what a dozen or twenty politicians decide will have a major impact on hundreds of millions of Indians and will affect their descendants. However, nationwide political demonstrations in India are still relatively rare. The person most eager about the current political situation is Gandhi.</p>
<h3>Truman Schedules Visit to Canada</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, April 30] The White House announced tonight that President Truman is scheduled to visit Canada on June 9 and will return on June 12. He will address the Canadian Parliament. Additionally, the President will personally attend and address the memorial service for the soldiers of the US Fifth Infantry Division who died in the Second European War, which will be held in Kansas City on June 7.</p>
<h3>Aiming to Resolve the Financial Crisis: New Italian Cabinet Formed; Left-Wing Parties Excluded</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] London, May 1 (Broadcast): The new Italian cabinet, excluding left-wing parties, was sworn in on May 1. The swearing-in ceremony took place at noon in the Presidential Palace, presided over by President Nicola.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, April 30] Christian Democratic leader Gasperi announced tonight that he had formed a new cabinet composed only of Christian Democrats and independent figures, excluding the Socialist and Communist parties. Earlier, Gasperi told reporters from this agency that his cabinet would not aim for party success but would strive with positive efforts to save the Italian economy. He knew that it was impossible to face major financial difficulties without temporarily abandoning party views. Since attempts to organize a government of all parties had failed, the party with a relatively large majority in parliament should take responsibility for governing the country. Gasperi also said that foreign economic aid to Italy was indispensable to the Italian people's efforts for reconstruction.</p>
<p>The new cabinet lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Prime Minister: Gasperi</p>
<p>Interior: Celba</p>
<p>Defense: Singolani</p>
<p>Education: Gonella</p>
<p>Public Works: Tubini</p>
<p>Industry and Commerce: Dugni</p>
<p>Labor: Fanfani</p>
<p>Merchant Marine: Caba</p>
<p>Posts and Telecommunications: Merlin</p>
<p>Agriculture: Segni</p>
<p>(All of the above are members of the Christian Democratic Party)</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Finance: Ainoudi (Governor of the Bank of Italy)</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs: Sforza</p>
<p>Foreign Trade: Messina</p>
<p>Transportation: Gobeini</p>
<p>(All of the above are non-partisan)</p>
<h3>French, Spanish, and Italian Communists Plan to Organize International Brigade to Assist Guerrillas in Greece</h3>
<p>(United Press, Rome, April 30) A report from Paris today stated that a group of communists from France, Spain, and Italy, including the famous Spanish Civil War general Miaja, met in southwestern France a month ago and decided to establish a plan for an international brigade to travel to Greece via Yugoslavia and join the guerrillas in fighting the government.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, April 30] Responsible officials here have expressed dismay at the possibility of an "international legion" being formed abroad to fight against Greece. According to recent official war reports, the new strategies adopted by the Greek government vary depending on whether military operations are taking place inland or along the border. For example, in the Thessaly region, government forces are mainly engaged in encircling and annihilating small guerrilla units of no more than fifty people. In the border areas of Thrace and Macedonia, government forces must cut off the lines of communication between the guerrillas and certain foreign countries. Guerrilla units in Thessaly, Thrace, and Macedonia often have "foreigners" mixed in among them. The formation of an "international legion" will further complicate the situation. The guerrillas' military equipment is becoming increasingly advanced, possessing not only machine guns but also anti-aircraft guns, which is causing the Greek government to feel uneasy.</p>
<h3>Bulgarian Steamer Seized by Greek Authorities</h3>
<p>[United Press, Athens, April 30] According to a report from Mytilene, authorities on the island of Mytilene have seized a Bulgarian steamer suspected of assisting Greek guerrillas. The steamer, named "Verner," was detained by Greek forces on the night of April 27 while trying to leave the island without flying any flags or lights. The island authorities suspected that the "Verner" was carrying guerrillas to Macedonia, but due to insufficient evidence, it will soon be released.</p>
<h3>De Gaulle Speech: Calls for French-American Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, April 30] General de Gaulle stated in a speech here today that the economic and social recovery of France is necessary and depends on the assistance of the United States and the efforts of the entire nation. American aid can immediately benefit France and even more benefit the United States itself. However, this assistance should be a loan based entirely on the spirit of friendship. De Gaulle also said that Europe must restore the forms and spirit of the West to become a third major force in the world, in addition to the United States and the Soviet Union. For this reason, France must maintain its Western form.</p>
<h3>Siamese Ambassador to Sweden to Become New Foreign Minister</h3>
<h3>British Pacific Fleet Commander Visits Siam</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bangkok, April 30] It was announced today that Prime Minister Luang Thamrong has invited four members of the old cabinet to join the new cabinet. The position of Foreign Minister goes to Atai Kitti, former Siamese Ambassador to Sweden. The ministers of Transportation and Health are also new. Luang Thamrong himself will concurrently serve as Minister of Justice, and the Minister of Commerce, originally held by Osatha Thanon, will be concurrently held by Education Minister Bannag.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Bangkok, April 30] Admiral Sir Boyd, Commander of the British Pacific Fleet, is scheduled to visit Bangkok for ceremonial purposes between June 6 and 12.</p>
<h3>US-Soviet Joint Commission Issues Communiqué; Negotiations Have Made Some Progress</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, April 30] The US-Soviet Joint Commission issued a communiqué today stating that, regarding the issue of organizing a unified Korean government, the US Chief Representative Brown and the Soviet Chief Representative Shtikov have agreed in principle to consult with various Korean democratic parties and public organizations on a broad basis, and have ordered subcommittees to draft consultation procedures. What needs to be decided is with which parties and factions to consult, who to recognize as representatives of each party and faction, and how to obtain the opinion of the majority of the people. Regarding the issue of publishing news, the commission also announced a policy of relaxing controls. In the future, in addition to issuing joint communiqués after major decisions according to the original method, it will also announce a summary of the contents of each meeting after each meeting. Brown and Shtikov may also separately meet with reporters to give talks, except for matters they have agreed to keep secret.</p>
<h3>The United States Hopes to Retain One Air Base in Greenland</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, April 30] Political figures here have stated that, regarding the Danish government's request to abolish the Greenland Defense Agreement signed in 1942, the United States now hopes to reach a compromise solution so that the United States can continue to use at least one of the air bases built there during the war. The Danish government's request for abolition has put the US Navy in a difficult position. Therefore, the US government is willing to negotiate with Denmark so that it can continue to use one of the air bases.</p>
<h3>Iran Demands Soviet Union Repay Gold Debt</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, April 30] It has been learned that Iranian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Prince Firouz, sent a note to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on May 26, demanding that the Soviet Union repay its overdue gold debt. According to this debt agreement, the Soviet State Bank should have repaid the Iranian National Bank on March 2 of last year, but the Soviet Union has not yet fulfilled its obligation.</p>
<h3>Communist Activities in the United States Have Somewhat Subsided</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, April 30] Attorney General Clark announced today that since President Truman ordered the purge of Communists and other conspirators from government agencies, Communist activities across the country have somewhat subsided, but have not completely stopped.</p>
<h3>Coup in Hungary Concludes; Left-Wing Parties Control the Situation; Most Old Cabinet Members Re-Elected</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hungarian Capital, April 30] The coup in Hungary, in which the minority Communist Party seized control of the government with Soviet assistance, was completed today. The Communist Party, which received 16 percent of the national vote in the last election, appears to have manipulated everything. It is clear that the new Prime Minister and his cabinet members have been approved by the Soviet Union. However, according to well-informed sources here, the widespread rumor that Hungary will accept Soviet training and equipment for the Hungarian army is unfounded.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Hungarian Capital, May 1] The new Hungarian cabinet led by General Dinnyés was sworn in last night. Former Foreign Minister Gyöngyösi is no longer the Foreign Minister in the new cabinet; the position of Foreign Minister will be temporarily held by Minister of Information Mihályfi. The swearing-in ceremony was delayed by half an hour due to a discussion among President Tildy, Communist Deputy Prime Minister Rákosi, and Deputy Prime Minister Szakasits over whether to allow Father Balogh to remain as Undersecretary. Father Balogh was considered the last line of defense for the Smallholders Party. In the end, the three decided that the cabinet would decide Father Balogh's fate on Monday.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, April 30] Diplomatic sources believe that the reorganized Hungarian government will not change the foundation of the old cabinet, and the political forces in Hungary can theoretically still maintain a balance. However, it is expected that the Smallholders Party will have to continue to purge members under pressure from the Communist and Social Democratic parties. Previously, many right-wing members of the Smallholders Party were purged for conspiring to overthrow the republic. After further purging, the Smallholders Party's majority in parliament may decrease. At the same time, it is expected that left-wing parties will intensify their demands for early general elections to strengthen their position. The list of the new cabinet is as follows:</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Ministers: Rákosi (Communist), Szakasits (Social Democrat)</p>
<p>Minister of State: Dobi (Smallholders Party)</p>
<p>Interior: Rák (Communist)</p>
<p>Industry: Bán (Social Democrat)</p>
<p>Transportation: Gerő (Communist)</p>
<p>Agriculture: Balogh (Smallholders Party)</p>
<p>Justice: Ries (Social Democrat)</p>
<p>Social Welfare: Molnár (Communist)</p>
<p>Supply: Erős (Smallholders Party)</p>
<p>(All of the above are re-elected old cabinet members)</p>
<p>New members joining the cabinet include:</p>
<p>Prime Minister and Defense: Dinnyés (Smallholders Party)</p>
<p>Finance: Nyárády (Party not announced)</p>
<p>Education: Ortutay (Party not announced)</p>
<p>Construction: Vályi (Leader of the National Peasants Party)</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs: Kettős (Ambassador to Italy)</p>
<h3>Arab Stance Strengthens; May Openly Declare War on Jews; UN Organization Faces Major Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Damascus, May 1] The Arab League Political Committee is scheduled to meet here on Thursday. Local newspapers say that the Arab League will declare war on the Jews at this important meeting. The newspapers all claim that this meeting will resolve that if the Arab League cannot achieve its goals through UN organizations, the Arab world will challenge the authority of the UN organizations, regardless of the world's reaction. The Arab world is about to abandon hope for a peaceful solution. In this situation, the only possible result is an open declaration of war on the Jews.</p>

<h3>Public Utility Price Adjustments Limited to Double Starting Next Monday; Electricity Companies Have Special Circumstances, Limits Will Be Slightly Relaxed</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Regarding the issue of adjusting the prices of public utilities in this city, the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Zhao Huizhao, took the night express train to Beijing last Friday to attend the National Commodity Price Conference held on the [unclear]th. He returned to Shanghai early yesterday morning at 8:00 am after the meeting. According to Director Zhao speaking to reporters, the Central government will continue to subsidize the losses of public utilities in this city for this month, maintaining the subsidy amount at the May figure, which is 16.61 billion yuan. However, because the cost of living and commodity prices in the Beijing and Shanghai areas have risen significantly, if subsidies from the central government at the May amount are still not enough to avoid losses, then the prices of public utilities in Shanghai and Nanjing may be allowed to be slightly adjusted, but only up to double the original price. Unless there are special circumstances, this limit will generally not be exceeded. The reporter then asked what kind of public utility institutions were referred to as special circumstances. According to Director Zhao, for example, the city's electric power company has not been included in the list of central government subsidies, and has suffered heavy losses in recent months, so the limit on price adjustments will have to be slightly relaxed. The reporter then asked when the adjustment of public utility prices in this city would begin. Director Zhao replied that after the various public utility institutions have drafted the adjusted prices, they must be submitted to the National Commodity Price Conference for review and approval before they can be implemented. It is estimated that it will be about a week later. The companies and institutions raising prices include: electricity, gas, trams, buses, telephones, tap water, ferries, and the two small railways of Shangchuan and Shangnan.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Visits Arrested Students; All Express Extreme Satisfaction with Treatment</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Mayor Wu, accompanied by Fang Zhi, Chairman of the Municipal Party Committee, and Commissioner Chen Baotai, departed from the official residence at 4:00 PM yesterday to visit students from various schools arrested in connection with the recent student unrest. According to Mayor Wu, speaking to reporters afterwards, the main purpose of his visit was to inquire about the treatment of the arrested students. He had individual talks with all the arrested students, and as a result, all of the students expressed great satisfaction with their treatment during their detention.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu also told reporters that the rumor that Jiaotong University student Yu Xikun had been tortured after being arrested, resulting in injuries all over his body, was false. The mayor specifically visited Yu Xikun yesterday afternoon and saw that he was in good health and everything was normal. The mayor requested that the student have a photo taken on the spot, but Yu Xikun declined, believing it was unnecessary. Later, at the mayor's request, he wrote a letter in his own hand, reporting that his life after being arrested was very privileged.</p>
<p>[Another Report] It is learned that the municipal authorities have allowed the parents or principals of arrested students to visit their children at their place of residence before they are released on bail. However, prior contact with the municipal authorities is required.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council General Assembly to Postpone Closing</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Municipal Council General Assembly has been discussing the municipal government's policies and other urgent proposals for several days. The assembly was originally scheduled to close on the afternoon of the 3rd of this month. According to the secretariat, the assembly will be postponed due to the large number of cases under discussion. However, the date of the postponement will depend on the proceedings of today's meeting.</p>
<p>The fourth meeting of the General Assembly will continue to discuss proposals this afternoon. At 9:00 AM, the Municipal Government Policy Report Review Committee and the Budget Committee will hold separate meetings. The General Assembly will discuss more important cases tomorrow: (1) Housing Lease Issues, (2) Exchange Issues, (3) Automobile Surtax for Construction, (4) Food Issues, (5) Budget Review, (6) Municipal Government Policy Report Review, (7) Nine Types of Financial Tax Regulations, (8) Ratification of Resolutions of Various Committees, (9) Reorganization of Various Committees, etc.</p>
<h3>Zhao Zukang Reports on Work, Invites Four Councilors for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Zhao Zukang, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, in order to enable the Municipal Council to understand the internal management of the bureau, invited Tang Shichang, Lu Yinchu, Wang Zhuyi, Chen Gongda, Wei Yunqing, and other councilors from the Council's Public Works Committee to a discussion at the bureau the day before yesterday. Director Zhao reported on the spot, stating that the work of the Bureau of Public Works can be divided into two types: basic and emergency. Internal management adopts scientific methods. As for the workers employed in the bureau, including public country police, heavy laborers, etc., the number has now been reduced to more than 5,400 people. More than 3,000 of them are currently scattered in various districts and locations repairing roads. Due to the shortage of people, it is necessary to use contract work methods for large projects, such as the widening of Tianmu Road. The policy of the Bureau of Public Works in implementing its work is to base its decisions on the resolutions of the Municipal Council, but road repair work is extremely difficult. After eight years of disrepair, not only are the roads severely damaged, but the water pipes are also damaged. According to Shanghai's topography, water pipes should be installed three feet below the road surface, but in the past, most were installed between two and three feet from the road surface, so damage is more likely. In short, although the work of the bureau may not reach the highest standards, it will do its best. Materials and machines are purchased as much as possible from government agencies such as the Central Trust Bureau and the Executive Yuan in order to obtain lower prices.</p>
<p>After the director finished his report, councilors Lu Yinchu and Chen Gongda stood up and stated that Director Zhao had arrived, [unclear], and had done many things, rather than coming to be an official. They hoped that he would continue to work hard in the future. Councilor Tang Shichang hoped that Director Zhao would remember " [unclear] can't be as good as people want, but seek to be worthy of my heart," and suggested [unclear] the director does not necessarily have to execute according to the resolutions of the council. It is permissible for him to initiate them himself, believing that based on the director's past achievements, his new facilities will be trusted. Zhu Zhuyi was concerned about the treatment of technical personnel, hoping that the Municipal Council and people from all walks of life would organize an organization on public works to help the Bureau of Public Works solve problems such as purchasing materials, economics, and personnel.</p>
<h3>In Front of the Atlantic Western Food Restaurant, Shadows of Axes and Gunshots; Dance Hall Employee Injured and Retaliates; Civilians, Both Male and Female, Are Affected</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] At around 11:45 PM last night, a revenge killing occurred in front of the Atlantic Western Food Restaurant on Fuzhou Road. The victim was Qiu Lianhuan, an investigator from a certain agency and an employee of the Cosmon Dance Hall. Qiu lived at No. 1, Gongyi Lane, Wanzhu Street, Nanshi. At the time, Qiu was walking east when several people suddenly surrounded him from behind and violently slashed his wrists and left leg with axes. Blood splattered everywhere.

<h3>Joint Meeting of Three Committees of the Municipal Council; Approves Standard Method for Rent; Maximum Amount Calculated at 1,800 Times the Pre-War Base</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Municipal Council's Legal, Land Administration, and Social Affairs Committees, in order to discuss the city's housing rental regulations and the Municipal Bureau of Land Administration's proposal regarding housing rental regulations, drafted a preliminary resolution to be submitted to the General Assembly for public decision. A joint meeting was held at the Municipal Council at 4:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>The councilors' discussion on housing rental issues was very enthusiastic. Some considered the interests of homeowners, some considered the burden of tenants, and some agreed with the housing rental standard passed by the Municipal Administration Council, which should not exceed 1,800 times the pre-war base, which is currently the multiple of civil servant salaries. However, some councilors believed that this multiple was too low, and landlords were at too much of a disadvantage. Other councilors did not advocate setting a standard at all. The discussion lasted for three and a half hours, and opinions remained divided. In the end, a voting method was adopted, and the majority passed the following standard method for housing rentals in Shanghai:</p>
<h3>Seven Measures</h3>
<p>(1) Before the completion of housing registration in this city, the maximum amount of rent in this city shall be temporarily determined to be calculated at 1,800 times the pre-war base. Those who live in schools, charitable organizations, autonomous institutions, or cultural societies shall be calculated at 80% of the amount.</p>
<p>(2) The Bureau of Land Administration shall handle housing registration according to law within six months and stipulate a uniform rental contract.</p>
<p>(3) The lessee shall not sublet the entire leased house to others. If a portion of the house is sublet, whether for residential or business use, the rent shall be calculated according to the ratio of the sublet portion of the house to the original rental amount. The maximum shall not exceed one times the original rent. The calculation method for the original rental deposit shall be the same.</p>
<p>(4) (1) Rent shall be paid monthly and shall not be calculated in foreign currency or in kind. If it was originally calculated in foreign currency or in kind, it shall be converted into legal tender according to the exchange rate or market price of the object on the date of promulgation of these measures. (2) If the agreed housing rent exceeds the provisions of these measures, the excess portion shall be regarded as unjust enrichment, and the lessee may request its return within three months from the date of promulgation of these measures.</p>
<p>(5) In addition to rent, a rental deposit may be collected for housing rental. The maximum amount shall not exceed the total amount of three months' rent. If the foregoing provision is violated, the excess portion shall be returned to the lessee.</p>
<p>(6) In addition to rent and security deposits, the lessor shall not collect tips or other expenses under any name. Violators shall return all fees and be subject to a fine of up to three times the amount by the competent authority.</p>
<p>(7) These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>

<h3>Recent Status of Xu Shiqi's Painting Exhibition: All Works Sold Out</h3>
<p>The renowned painter Professor Xu Shiqi taught at National Central University during the War of Resistance. While in Sichuan, he traveled to various southwestern provinces and held solo exhibitions in Chongqing, Chengdu, and Kunming. In the spring of the 31st year, Madame Chiang Kai-shek commissioned the giant painting "Soaring Ambitions" as a gift to General Chennault of the Flying Tigers, earning international acclaim. After returning to Shanghai, he founded the Yiyuan Art Studio. Recently, over sixty works were displayed at [whitespace] Science [whitespace] on Southwest Road, organized by Li Shizeng and [whitespace] Kong [whitespace]. Attendees included Ke [whitespace], Pan Gong [whitespace], Ren [whitespace], Bingzhi, and over a hundred others. Xu's works primarily depict Mount Huang, the Wu [whitespace], [whitespace] police [whitespace], among which the "Evergreen [whitespace]" [whitespace], twelve feet tall and twenty feet wide, [whitespace] exquisite workmanship, has already been purchased by collector [whitespace] Zhou. All other works have been sold out. It is reported that there are still four days left in the exhibition.</p>
<h3>Police Officers Possess High National Consciousness and Cannot Be Incited: Deputy Director Yu Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Deputy Director Shu Ping of the Municipal Police Bureau issued the following statement regarding recent rumors of reactionary elements exploiting student strikes to incite Shanghai police to participate in the "June 2nd" march and demonstration: It has been found that approximately half of the current police force in this city consists of officers retained from the Municipal Council, with many having served for one or two decades or more. They possess extensive work experience and a strong interest in serving. Most of their families have side businesses, and their lives are relatively stable. As for the new police officers, they are all graduates of junior high school or higher, have undergone rigorous training, possess a high level of national consciousness, and are mostly single, with lighter burdens. Coming from rural areas, they are also extremely simple in nature, and their usual dedication to service is commendable. Therefore, not only is there no room for incitement, but they will forever be a spiritual fortress of Shanghai, which I can guarantee. Yu also stated: The salaries and benefits of police officers in this city have also been improved as much as possible. Currently, in addition to a base salary of 340,000 yuan, police officers receive a multiplier of 1,800, plus an adjustment allowance of approximately 20,000 yuan issued by the municipal government, accounting for 10% of their base salary. Based on the lowest base salary of 55 yuan, each officer can receive at least 460,000 yuan per month. As for senior police officers, in addition to a base salary of 238,000 yuan, they receive a multiplier of 1,800 [whitespace], plus an adjustment allowance of approximately 30,000 yuan issued by the municipal government, accounting for 20% of their base salary. Even based on the lowest salary grade of 45 yuan for senior officers, they can still receive at least 310,000 yuan or more. In addition, senior police officers receive an extra five dou of rice, which, when converted to the market price, makes their benefits comparable to those of police officers. Furthermore, in consideration of the difficult living conditions of senior officers, the mayor has also allocated daily necessities. Therefore, given the city's current financial constraints, the salaries and benefits received by police officers in this city can be considered generous compared to those in other parts of the country. Moreover, the police bureau's welfare programs, such as the police hospital, elementary school for children, and mutual assistance for police officers and workers injured or killed in the line of duty, provide significant assistance to the lives of police officers. Therefore, they would never act recklessly and make unnecessary sacrifices.</p>
<h3>Opening Ceremony of the Shanghai Branch of the Red Cross Society's Fundraising Campaign: Hoping to Contribute Money and Effort</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The opening ceremony of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society's 1947 fundraising campaign was held yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM at the New Life Movement Club. Attendees included Wang Zhengting, He Dequi, Zhang Xiaosong, Liu Hongsheng, Shui Xiangyun, Wang Guanqing representing Mayor Wu, Xu Mingya representing Chairman Fang, Mike Bian representing the China International Relief Committee, and others. Chairman Wang Zhengting of the Central Red Cross Society delivered the opening remarks, recalling the Red Cross's wartime achievements and the touching international donations. He expressed hope that the Chinese people would enthusiastically join the Red Cross Society and contribute both "money and effort."</p>
<h3>Residents Assigned to Enemy-Occupied Housing Petitioned the Municipal Council Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the three committees of the Municipal Council—Legal Affairs, Land Administration, and Social Affairs—held a joint meeting to discuss the issue of rent. The "Association of Residents Assigned to Enemy-Occupied Housing" in this city sent ten representatives to petition the council. Councillors Ma Junshuo, Wang Weizhi, and Shao Yongsheng received them on behalf of the council. The petitioning representatives presented four points: (1) The association represents tens of thousands of military, government, and educational personnel who have been assigned housing and requests continued lease agreements, hoping the council will fully support this to maintain social stability. (2) Regarding the housing allocation issue, the association hopes the council will reaffirm the resolution of the previous general meeting, determine specific measures, and submit them to the municipal government for implementation. (3) The association expresses support for the proposals submitted by Councillors Feng Youzhen, Zhao Junhao, and Zhang Zhihan and hopes the council will adopt and pass them. (4) The housing allocation issue is different in nature from the rent issue and cannot be confused. If the council passes reasonable rent standards, the assigned residents will absolutely comply. Councillors Ma, Wang, and Shao expressed sincere sympathy for the opinions presented by the petitioning representatives and stated their willingness to propose the formation of a small committee on housing allocation at the joint meeting of the three committees to specifically discuss this issue and seek a reasonable resolution.</p>
<h3>Empathy and Enthusiastic Participation</h3>
<p>Liu Hongsheng gave a passionate speech, stating that the Chinese Red Cross Society's funding largely depends on donations from friendly nations and a small portion from government subsidies. During the war, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia made great efforts, but later, Southeast Asia was swept by the enemy, suffering from poison and devastation. Today, they have not yet recovered their vitality and themselves need relief. Therefore, he sincerely hopes that the Chinese people will consider it an honor to join the Red Cross Society and participate widely to increase the strength of the Red Cross. Subsequently, He Dequi, the representative of Mayor Wu, the representative of Chairman Fang, and the representative of the Garrison Command all gave speeches, emphasizing that the Red Cross Society is an unconditional charitable organization and aid agency. The Chinese people should, out of human compassion, extend empathy and participate enthusiastically to achieve the fundraising goals. Mike Bian, the representative of the China International Relief Committee, was also invited to speak. Mr. Bian worked in western China during the War of Resistance and once served in the medical team during the Nu River Campaign, expressing deep admiration for China's wartime relief efforts. He stated that foreign workers in China would do their best to assist in promoting this great plan.</p>
<h3>Only Success Allowed, Failure Not Permitted</h3>
<p>Shui Xiangyun spoke on behalf of the Federation of Labor Unions, stating that the success or failure of the fundraising effort can test the conscience of the people of Shanghai. For the sake of Shanghai's honor, only success is allowed, and failure is not permitted. Shanghai's workers, numbering 800,000, will do their utmost under the principle of "contributing effort when possible." Wang Zhengting immediately stated: American workers donate one US dollar each to join the Red Cross Society, accumulating little by little. Therefore, he hopes that each of the 800,000 workers will contribute 12,000 yuan, which would total over 9 billion yuan. Mr. Wang's emotions were passionate at the time, and all attendees applauded greatly. The meeting adjourned in an atmosphere of excitement at 4:50 PM.</p>
<h3>Persons Responsible for the Robbery of the Li Steamer Detained for Questioning</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Nantong on the 1st] After the robbery of the Zhong Hang Company's Hang Li steamer, the Nantong Police Bureau, suspecting the steamer, detained the persons responsible for questioning. Passengers on board also expressed suspicion, noting that this robbery was identical to last year's robbery, and the steamer itself suffered no losses and did not sound the whistle for help, indicating doubt. It is reported that the company plans to invite reporters from this county in the coming days to provide an explanation.</p>
<h3>"June 2nd" Can Be Passed Safely: Strengthened Security Last Night and Today</h3>
<p>An official from the Garrison Command informed reporters last night that this city can definitely pass June 2nd safely. This day was originally the date when Communist conspirators planned to launch the "Three Strikes and One Tragedy" movement in major cities across the country. The military and political authorities in this city had already received this intelligence and taken careful precautions, so the danger of "June 2nd" has already been eliminated. However, as a precaution, security has been slightly strengthened last night and today compared to usual.</p>

<h3>Zhao Zengjue Invited to Broadcast: An Outline of Public Utilities in This City; This Newspaper's Ninth Weekly Special Broadcast Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] This newspaper held its ninth weekly special broadcast at Asia Radio yesterday, inviting Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, to broadcast "An Outline of Public Utilities in This City." The text of his speech is as follows: "The agency in charge of public utilities in this city is the Public Utilities Bureau. Since the restoration, the Public Utilities Bureau has adhered to four principles in organizing and developing public utilities in this city, which are outlined as follows: (1) Shanghai's position is that of an international commercial port externally and an industrial and commercial center internally. The facilities of public utilities must recognize this position and coordinate with its development. (2) The facilities of public utilities should have integrity and unity and should not be divided. Although a certain public utility may be operated by several units, it should be operated under a unified plan, with mutual connection and coordination. (3) Although public utilities have developed in an unreasonable state in the past, the current discussion of rationalization does not mean starting from scratch, but rather using the method of organizing and improving to bring the original business into the right track. (4) The operation of public utilities in a publicly-owned enterprise is naturally the most ideal. However, the municipal treasury has limited financial resources. Therefore, any public utility that has been operated successfully or is preparing to be operated, whether by foreign or Chinese businesses, is welcome as long as it can be operated in accordance with the principles of rationalization, enterprise, and public benefit. Next, let's talk about the general situation of public utilities: (1) Electricity. Shanghai is an industrial center, and electricity is the mother of industry, so there should be a sufficient supply. Before the war, the total capacity of Shanghai's power plants was 260,000 kilowatts. According to pre-war statistics, it was predicted that it might increase to 410,000 kilowatts within the next five years. Adding 15% of the standby capacity, it should be 470,000 kilowatts. However, due to wartime losses, it currently only has 180,000 kilowatts, and it may increase to 200,000 kilowatts by the end of this year, but it is still short of 270,000 kilowatts. According to the plan of the Public Utilities Bureau, on the one hand, while retaining the original state of individual operation of each power plant, technical connections will be made to complete the joint high-voltage transmission network. On the other hand, it will initiate the organization of a joint electric power company to establish a large power plant. It is also planned to request the central government to allocate Japanese war reparations for electrical machinery, which the joint company will have priority to purchase, in order to facilitate the development of industry in this city. (2) Water supply. Not only does the suburbs of this city still lack water supply equipment, but even within the urban area, it is still not possible to fully supply water. The plan of the Public Utilities Bureau is: on the one hand, to make the water plants as technically connected as possible, connecting the main pipes to supply each other, and on the other hand, to prepare to set up a new plant in western Shanghai. The bureau has now established the Shanghai West Waterworks Design Office to carry out preparatory work, and at the same time, it has formulated an emergency project plan: (A) Opening three self-flowing wells, which can be completed by mid-July. (B) Adding reservoirs, transferring and reselling water from the French Concession. (C) Instructing the British company to extend the water injection time at the Jiaozhou Road water station, and the British company has been notified to handle it. (3) Gas. Gas is a cheap and clean fuel. In cities like London and New York, gas users account for almost half of all households, while this city currently only has 20,000 households, so gas definitely has a bright future in Shanghai. Currently, the total daily output of the British Gas Company and the Public Utilities Bureau's Wusong Gas Plant is less than 5 million cubic feet. The plan of the Public Utilities Bureau: to prepare to establish a new plant in Nanshi, assuming a capacity of 5 million cubic feet per day. In the future, the Wusong plant will be increased to 2 million cubic feet per day, and the British Gas Company will be 4 million cubic feet, and the three units will jointly supply a total of 10 million cubic feet. The Wusong plant and the British company have already implemented joint supply. (4) Telephone. Telephone is the nerve system of this city. However, the operators of telephones in this city are the American Shanghai Telephone Company and the Directorate General of Telecommunications of the Ministry of Communications. Having two telephone organizations in one place, and using different systems of telephones, causes various shortcomings. The Public Utilities Bureau believes that in order to rationalize the telephone system in Shanghai, a uniform system must be adopted technically, and a unified organization must be adopted in operation. In order to adapt to future development, a zoning and phased implementation plan has been formulated based on the current distribution of industry, commerce, and population, and is currently being submitted to the central government for approval. (5) Land Transportation. This city is an industrial center and an international commercial port, so urban transportation should be connected and coordinated with wharves, railway stations, and airports. Internally, it should be connected and coordinated with industrial areas, commercial areas, residential areas, and school districts. Before the war, because the municipal institutions were divided into three, there were few mutually connected traffic arteries in each district, especially in the north and south. Now that the municipality has been unified, all vertical and horizontal traffic arteries should be re-planned. First, the British Electric Tramway Company, the French Electric Tramway Company, and the Preparatory Committee of the Public Transportation Company of the Public Utilities Bureau should be technically coordinated in unison, and at the same time, they should do their best to expand the Public Transportation Company. The company currently has 164 buses operating on 11 routes. Long-distance buses in the suburbs are contracted out to merchants, and a total of eight routes have been opened. (6) Water Transportation. Pudong and Puxi are only separated by a river, but their development status is very different. To develop Pudong, water transportation must first be developed. The Public Utilities Bureau has now reorganized the self-operated ferry into a joint public-private company, striving to expand ferry equipment, and has begun the truck crossing project, which is expected to open in the autumn of this year.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be explained that the Public Utilities Bureau is the administrative agency for public utilities, responsible for the design, guidance, and supervision of public utilities, while other water plants, power plants, etc. are the operational organizations for public utilities. We hope that citizens of this city who have opinions on public utilities will put them forward as much as possible. The bureau will do its best within the possible scope to strive for the progress and rationalization of public utilities."</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan Held Tea Party Yesterday to Entertain Fudan University Professors and Exchange Views on Guiding Student Protests</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan invited Fudan University professors to a tea party at the mayor's residence on Anfu Road at 10:00 AM yesterday to exchange views on guiding the student protests at the university. About thirty people attended, including Chen Wangdao, Ma Zongrong, Zhang Zhirang, Gu Zhongyi, and Wu Fu, members of the university's faculty association. Fang, the chairman of the Municipal Party Committee, Zhao Yangxiong, Yan Yilin, municipal councilors and alumni of the university, and Sun Jiulu, a member of the Legislative Yuan, also attended.</p>
<p>During the tea party, the mayor explained to the Fudan professors the government's difficult position in dealing with the protests. He said that it was very difficult to arrest those who disrupt social stability among the majority of people, which could easily lead to disputes. However, the government was determined to implement the resolutions of the Municipal Council. The Fudan professors immediately expressed that the strike was also a last resort. They hoped that the authorities would decide on a proper solution and considered the resolutions of the Council to be quite appropriate. However, they asked if the mayor could show special leniency to the youth, not arrest those who had not yet been arrested, and release all those who had been arrested on bail by the school.</p>
<p>The mayor continued that the government's investigation list was very careful. To avoid some elements causing strikes and affecting the safety of the city, it was necessary to temporarily isolate them. At the same time, due to concerns that those with more serious offenses would be released and no one would be responsible for the summons, it was necessary to consider the severity of the situation and act in accordance with the resolution of the Council, which was the most reasonable approach.</p>
<p>The conversation lasted until 2:00 PM. The professors immediately stated that they had just been elected as members of the faculty association the day before and that the faculty association had not yet formally discussed the matter. Therefore, they promised to convene a faculty association meeting after returning to the university to report the conversation and make explanations.</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University Faculty Association Entertained Reporters Yesterday and Reported the Evolution of Student Protests</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The faculty association of Jiaotong University entertained reporters at the International Hotel on the 14th floor of the city at 3:00 PM yesterday. The professors reported on the strike to protest the "May 30th" incident and protect the safety of students. Qiu Weiyu, chairman of the faculty association, presided over the reception.</p>
<p>Attitude of the Faculty Association</p>
<p>Professor Ji Wenmei reported on the evolution of the strike at the university, stating that the Jiaotong University professors had made great efforts to persuade the students to restore order, but the arrest of students by a large number of military police at 2:00 AM on the 30th was unexpected. Not only were the students emotionally agitated, but they also felt that there was no way to save the situation. In addition to telegraphing the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education to appeal, they announced a strike to protest. Ji also clarified the attitude of the university's faculty association: (1) They have always tried their best to dissuade students from striking; (2) Student protests should be guided, not suppressed; (3) The military and police authorities should improve their measures in dealing with student protests. Ji also reported the results of the exchange of views between the professors and the mayor at the mayor's residence on the evening of the 31st, which had been decided by the faculty association talk on the 1st of today: "If the government agrees with the suggestions from this association, classes can resume."</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Opinion</p>
<p>Professor Chen Hu then reported that Mayor Wu had signed and agreed to the six suggestions provided by the association yesterday morning: (1) The municipal government and the garrison headquarters will jointly issue a notice at the school gate that, if the situation at the school is peaceful, no more students will be arrested except for the eighteen (the authorities believe that eighteen students at the school should be arrested, two have already been arrested, and sixteen are still at large). (2) The municipal government will inform the school by letter that no military police will be sent to the school to arrest people without the school's prior consent. (3) The arrested students will be dealt with in accordance with the measures announced by the Municipal Council in the newspapers on June 1st. After the school resumes classes, if the sixteen who have not yet been arrested come to the school, the school will accompany them to surrender to the municipal government or the garrison headquarters and handle them according to the following methods based on the severity of the situation: (1) The school will be responsible for management; (2) Parents or guarantors will take them back; (3) If the school and the municipal authorities confirm that the evidence is accurate, they will be handled in accordance with the methods passed by the Municipal Council. (4) The municipal government and the garrison headquarters will be responsible for severely punishing the murderers of the "May 30th" incident, but due to the urgency of time, it will be handled after June 2nd. (5) The medical expenses of the injured students and the losses of the school will be paid by the municipal government after the council's investigation. (6) The school may send professor representatives to observe the arrest of students. Fan, the speaker of the Municipal Council, and Zhao Cengjue, the person in charge of the school's alumni association, signed as witnesses to the above items. The faculty association expressed satisfaction with this.</p>
<p>Finally, Qiu specifically stated that the reports in a certain newspaper and a certain evening newspaper that Professor Zhong Weicheng of the school incited student protests and that students grabbed guns in the "May 30th" incident were inaccurate and hoped to be corrected. He also said that, according to Mayor Wu, the arrested students were treated with absolute courtesy, and the food and drink were better than usual at school. The Health Bureau sent doctors to check their health. Mayor Wu also visited the living and eating conditions of the detained students yesterday. The press conference ended at about 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>With Results from Various Parties’ Mediation, Jiaotong University Will Resume Classes Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Jiaotong University Faculty Association held a meeting at the school at 10:00 AM yesterday. More than sixty professors attended. Chen Dongyuan, a supervisor from the Ministry of Education, Bangban Tong Daxun, Li Kaidi, a representative of the Municipal Council, and Zhao Cengyu, the person in charge of the school's alumni association, were invited to attend to discuss how to resolve the student protests. Qiu Weiyu, the chairman of the Faculty Association, presided over the meeting. Li Taiyun, a professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering who attended the tea party with Mayor Wu the night before, reported on the experience of participating in the mayor's tea party (see yesterday's newspaper). Chen Dongyuan then delivered a speech, explaining that Minister Zhu was extremely uneasy after receiving news of Principal Wu's resignation and the unfortunate events of the "May 30th" at the school, and specially sent him and Tong Daxun to Shanghai to express condolences. Chen continued to explain that the Ministry of Education had already agreed to most of the requests made by the school last month and promised to assist in the school's development in the future. Regarding the arrest of students, Chen said that the measures taken by the local authorities might not be without criticism, but the authorities had no choice but to ensure the safety of the lives and property of the city's residents in order to avoid a "June 2nd" incident. Therefore, from the perspective of education, they hoped that the professors would help to quell the student protests and restore classes as soon as possible. Zhao Cengyu, from the Alumni Association, explained that the country was facing serious difficulties, even greater than during the war, and hoped that the professors would prioritize the country, the school, and education, and assist the government in stabilizing the youth. Councilor Li Kaidi explained that the national student protests this time were indeed different from previous student protests, and the measures taken by the local authorities could be described as "well-intentioned." The current situation should be carefully considered and calmly analyzed. After several professors expressed their opinions, it was decided that the six suggestions provided by the association would be implemented if the authorities agreed, and classes would resume in the shortest possible time. According to the reporter, the six suggestions made by the association had been agreed to by Mayor Wu and signed yesterday morning. The association learned of this yesterday afternoon and will resume classes tomorrow (3rd).</p>
<h3>The Patriotic Education Association Will Expand to a National Level, and Major Middle Schools in the City Are Automatically Responding</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Liu Chongde, Chen Siyi, and ten other representatives of the Nanjing Patriotic Student Union arrived in Shanghai and immediately began activities, contacting university authorities, professors, and students in the city in order to unite with the university students in the city and expand the Patriotic Education Association into a national and permanent organization. At 3:00 PM yesterday, representatives of the association entertained reporters at the New Life Club in the city. Liu Chongde, a representative, first reported on the causes of the student protests in Beijing and the establishment, history and significance of the Patriotic Education Association, stating that the student protests were caused by students demanding an increase in food expenses, the so-called "eat up the movement." In fact, the non-staple food expenses currently amount to about 100,000 yuan per month. Now 90% of the people in the country cannot enjoy this kind of thing. The conspirators took the opportunity to instigate and create violent student protests. Some ignorant students followed and were used by them. The students realized that this kind of tram-rail action would endanger the country, and could no longer remain silent. So, under the call of justice, they stood up and formed a patriotic student union with students from more than 30 schools, including Zhongda, Jin University, and the Oriental Language College, and began to publicize to all sectors of society in Beijing on May 29th. The results were very good. The propaganda team was warmly welcomed by the people wherever they went. As a result of the propaganda on May 29th and 30th, the students in Beijing had turned 180 degrees. More than 80% of the students were against strikes. The conspirators have exhausted their plans, and their planned "June 2nd General Strike" will not be realized. Nanjing is as quiet as ever. Now, the working goal of the Patriotic Education Association is to awaken students across the country so that they are not used by others. We are also dissatisfied with the current situation, and we also have demands for reform, but we will proceed in a proper manner and will never allow any deviant actions. Chen Siyi then reported on the significance of coming to Shanghai, stating that there were two missions this time: first, to represent the students in Beijing to express condolences to Shanghai; second, to bring the results obtained in Nanjing to Shanghai, and is currently taking contact with various schools, and intends to cooperate with students from various schools, and intends to contact all parts of the country such as Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, and Kunming. Today (1st) he went to Fudan University and saw that the students were in a very good mood. If the professors have no problems, classes can be resumed. He also reported the source of funds for the Patriotic Education School Association, which came from the 500-yuan movement and was donated by students, with no background. In addition, it was reported that students from major middle schools in the city have automatically responded to this patriotic education movement. "Patriotism First" and "Protecting Education First". Students' parents also expressed deep sympathy.</p>
<h3>Huangdu Village Teacher Started a Student Protest, and the Education Department Approved the Suspension of Classes Immediately</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Jiading Report] The Provincial Huangdu Rural Normal School is located in Lantang Village, Anting Township, in this county. Recently, a small number of students incited a disturbance and held a meeting to deny all the school's regulations.

<h3>Professors from Various Colleges and Universities in Fuzhou Telephoned to Appeal to Young People to Use Reason</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Fuzhou Telegram on the 1st] The principals, professors, lecturers, and teachers of various public and private colleges and universities in Fuzhou believe that the recent student protests are on the rise, and it is regrettable that the students are wasting their studies.

<h3>Kaifeng Women's Teachers Came to Shanghai to Visit</h3>

<h3>Daxia Celebrated its Anniversary Yesterday</h3>
<p>Sun Ke Presided over the Celebration Ceremony</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday was the 23rd anniversary of Daxia University. The school held a celebration ceremony at 9:00 AM, and more than 2,000 guests from all walks of life, alumni, faculty and staff attended. Sun Ke, the chairman of the school's board of directors, and his wife came to the school to preside over the ceremony and elaborated on the current peace issue, stating that peace is the unanimous demand of the government and the people. Both sides should not use force. Since the people have called for peace under the rule of the National Government, it is hoped that the same call will be made to the CCP region. The current dispute in China is for the government to seek unity and the realization of the constitution. If the Communist Party lays down its arms and participates in national politics and becomes an opposition party, it is very reasonable. If the constitution can be implemented, national affairs can be resolved without resorting to force. The main reason for the various unstable situations in society is internal strife. Taking the student protests in various places as an example, the central government is required to increase education funding by 15%, which is stipulated in the constitution, but now all of it is consumed by internal strife. If everyone lays down their arms, China will definitely be able to achieve peace. Zhu Jingnong, the president of Guanghua University, then delivered a speech, representing Guanghua University, wishing "Daxia shines, and China shines." Representatives from the Municipal Party Committee then delivered speeches, offering many congratulations. Yesterday afternoon, the school's alumni, faculty, staff, and guests enjoyed "The Joy of a Family," which was presided over by the school's vice president, Zhu Yuxiang. President Ou Yuanhuai reported on the overall situation of the school's reconstruction and the students' self-love, love of the school, no strikes, no parades, and no fighting during the student protests. Laughter and applause lasted for three hours. At that time, it was also decided that the first Sunday of November each year would be the Alumni Return Day. The school also had a two-day holiday, with entertainment in the afternoon and evening each day, as well as performances of "A Little Man's Daydream," "Counter-espionage," and "The Wilderness," which made the whole school rejoice and the event was very grand.</p>

<p>A brief description of the various matches is as follows: (1) In the first visit to Shanghai, the venue was unfamiliar, the movements were flustered, and it was impossible to control the opponent's activities. They lost to Renyu by four points. (2) Displayed power and won against the Shantou team by seven points, but there were many fouls, and at critical moments, they hesitated to hold the ball. The Shantou team also lost their usual self-centeredness, with only six out of nineteen free throws. (3) Relied on cooperation to seize the opportunity and accurate shooting, making the Giants helpless, winning by as many as twelve points. (4) Heavily defeated by Encas, because of panic and confusion, they lost the opportunity, and eight foreign players, seven of whom could shoot, lost nineteen points. (5) Won against Hualian by luck. At that time, Hualian "was careless about their diet" and had a group of dysentery. (6) Although they were no match for Qunsheng, it was still a wonderful match, putting Qunsheng in a difficult situation. (7) The charity match against Huasheng was difficult to distinguish, resulting in a 47-point draw, but in the last second, they were still leading by two points, showing courtesy, and both sides missed many shots. (8) Won against Black and White by two points, and the situation was still tense. In the overall situation, Black and White often led by one or two points, and Zheng Lun finally succeeded. There was nothing good to say about the war. (9) Demonstrated a fast offensive and won against McLarens, thanks to the momentum of the first quarter and the wonderful shots of Yu and Cai in the final quarter.</p>
<p>This time, they came again (1) Won Chenyou...57-38 (2) Won Renyu...55-29 (3) Won Shantou...56-38 (4) Won John...65-25 (5) Won Encas...49-40 (6) Won Giant...42-40</p>
<p>Description of the six performances: (1) The fierce offensive and shooting of the three musketeers Tu Wenlong, Cai Zhongqiang, and Yu Ruizhang made Chenyou difficult to deal with. However, the state at the beginning of the game seemed sluggish for the expeditionary force. (2) Big victory over Renyu, in "tightening" and "speeding up". (3) Winning the Shantou team by as many as eighteen points was due to sufficient strength and calm response. (4) Against John, the champion of the city's university basketball, Zheng Lun won by forty points, and new players participated in the war, controlling the overall situation. (5) Revenge, defeating the aggressive Encas, Cai Yu and Wang were all injured one after another, which shows the intensity of the battle. (6) Overwhelming the Giant, achieving six wins in six games, the battle situation was slightly dull, and Zheng Lun led all the way.</p>

<h3>In Order to Rationalize Gauze Adjustment, the Central Government Plans to Establish a New Organization; Government Policies and Private Interests Are Both Considered</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] It is reported that the central authorities may consider establishing a special agency under the National Economic Commission to handle gauze adjustment in order to rationalize gauze adjustment. Relevant parties stated that the current implementation of the rigid price control system for gauze has clearly deviated from the actual needs. For example, the gauze produced by state-owned yarn factories is always allocated and sold according to the controlled price, but because the black market price is often higher than the controlled price, the business management of state-owned yarn factories has faced great difficulties. How to eliminate this contradictory phenomenon will inevitably require adjusting the current gauze policy so that both state-owned and private yarn factories can benefit. Therefore, the emergence of a new gauze adjustment organization has the need for an objective environment. The establishment of this new organization and the selection of its leaders must be carefully considered. In terms of execution, it is especially necessary to strive for impartiality so that both government gauze policies and private interests can be considered and the most satisfactory solution for gauze can be obtained.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the central authorities deeply sympathize with the current undetermined business policy and the low wages of employees of the China Textile Construction Company and have decided to improve them based on the actual situation. It is reported that the newly appointed Minister of Economic Affairs, Chen Qitian, will come to Shanghai this week. Chen will conduct an on-site inspection of the cotton yarn industry in this city and decide on a reorganization policy for gauze.</p>
<h3>Central Cooperative Treasury Promotes Cooperative Financial System Cooperative Loans Through Unified Lending Plan to Issue Bonds of 50 Billion to Replenish Funds</h3>
<p>A person in charge of the Central Cooperative Treasury told reporters that the treasury's current main task is to support the development of cooperative undertakings in the pacification areas. However, after eight years of separation and chaos in our country, the vast rural areas, barren land, and shrinking production have become an important part of the entire economic problem. Therefore, developing cooperative undertakings to improve the rural economy is a truly urgent plan. The treasury has established six sub-treasuries and eight branch treasuries throughout the country. Its original cooperative treasuries in Sichuan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Guangxi, Fujian, Yunnan, and other six provinces, and the Chongqing Cooperative Treasury, will all be reorganized in accordance with the law and officially opened in the near future. However, with the current treasury funds of only 3 billion yuan allocated by the national treasury, it will be difficult to undertake the above-mentioned arduous tasks. Therefore, the authorities have considered giving the following support: (1) The government will notify the Four Joint Offices to inform the various banks and bureaus to provide the treasury with a large amount of overdraft funds. (2) All bank cooperative loans should be lent through the treasury in a unified manner. (3) The treasury will issue bonds of 50 billion yuan, which will be separately underwritten by the various banks and bureaus. (4) The treasury may discount or rediscount bills to various national banks separately and may reinsure insurance policies with the China Trust Bureau, thereby laying the foundation for the cooperative financial system.</p>

<p>The Silk Cocoon Production and Sales Guidance Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Economic Affairs stipulates that, with silkworm cocoons from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces already on the market, the deadline for approved lending firms to pay deposits and sign loan contracts is June 3rd. Failure to meet this deadline will result in the cancellation of loan qualifications.</p>
<h3>Approaching Mold Season Dampens Cigarette Market</h3>
<p>The cigarette market has seen a decline due to the approaching mold season, with significant selling activity in the market. Dealers, with ample reserves, are less interested in buying. This morning, ten cases of Great Britain cigarettes opened at 7.45 million yuan, but quickly dropped to 2.5 million yuan before buyers emerged. The afternoon market saw further decline, with more sellers than buyers. Ten cases of Great Britain cigarettes closed at 7.18 million yuan, a decrease of 3.2 million yuan per case compared to the previous day. Old Knife cigarettes also saw a slight decrease to 6.18 million yuan, while Five-Flower and Hardman brands also saw price decreases of 160,000 to 170,000 yuan. Other brands from various factories, including Big Beauty, Portman, Brandy, and 20-pack cigarettes, also saw overall price declines.</p>
<h3>Chinese Tea Exporters Request Government Relief</h3>
<p>The China Tea Joint Operations Company Manager, 　 Cheng, conveyed to the authorities the current difficulties faced by tea exporters. He traveled to Nanjing last night. It is reported that this trip will present two points to the Four Banks Joint Treasury:</p>
<p>(1) Please expedite the loan disbursement for new tea. Although Qimen tea has been abandoned, Ping Shui and Tunxi tea need urgent assistance. The loan amount should be temporarily set at 20 billion, with the total amount to be discussed later.</p>
<p>(2) Last year's old tea amounted to approximately × 10,000 dan, pledged to the Agricultural Bank of China, with a value of approximately 1.6 million US dollars. However, tea merchants suffered significant losses due to last year's capital stagnation. If sold at current international market prices, it would not be enough to cover the pledged amount. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities will support this only major export industry and instruct the Agricultural Bank of China to handle it flexibly.</p>
<h3>Matches Highly Profitable, Soap Market Weakens</h3>
<p>Among daily necessities, matches are the most profitable. The final price of New Beauty matches rose to 2.69 million yuan, a further increase of 60,000 yuan from the previous day. Phoenix brand also rose to 2.72 million yuan, a substantial increase of 100,000 yuan per case. New brands such as Rose, Nanjing, and Golden Tripod also increased by varying amounts of 40,000 to 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The soap market is relatively weak, reportedly due to eager demand from other ports, leading to significant selling activity in the market. Furthermore, a large batch of Huang Xiangmao brand soap was directly purchased from the factory at 2.6 million yuan per case, with delivery in one week, leading to a sluggish market. 　　　　　 Soap, 120 pieces per 　　, at a small 11,000 yuan, was 2.63 million yuan. Gu Benguan, Dao Guang, and other brands also saw price decreases ranging from 1,000 to 6,000 yuan. It is reported that the China 　 Soap Company plans to make slight adjustments to the factory prices of Huang Xiangmao and other brands, with Huang Xiangmao set at 2.6 million yuan per case, Sunlight soap at 3.9 million yuan, and Medicated soap at 3.7 million yuan. However, the prices of Bai Xiangmao and other goods will remain unchanged. As for Gu Ben soap from the Five Continents Soap Factory, distribution is expected to begin this week, with each dealer receiving 10 to 20 cases.</p>

<h3>Import and Export Industry Seeks Self-Reliance, Organizes Joint Operations Company, Capital Set at 10 Billion to 50 Billion</h3>
<p>The city's import and export industry is currently facing losses in exports and a lack of foreign exchange supply for imports, resulting in a state of near-shutdown. This is detrimental to agriculture, industry, and commerce, and severely impacts the future development of the national economy. To rescue the import industry from this crisis, a large-scale China Import and Export Joint Operations Company is planned, with a projected total capital of 10 billion to 50 billion yuan. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Organizational Principles: The organizational principles of the company are as follows: (1) It will bring together all willing import and export businesses, whether they solely engage in import, export, or both, as well as overseas Chinese holding remittances and domestic individuals holding foreign exchange, and entrepreneurs willing to import raw materials and machinery or export their finished products. (2) Groups with similar goals will operate under the same organization. Exporters, as shareholders, will provide their foreign exchange earnings to importers, who are also shareholders. The profits earned by importers, as shareholders, will offset the losses incurred by exporters, who are also shareholders. In short, whether importing, exporting, or both, all parties will have the same shareholder status within the same organization, with the aim of maintaining and developing international trade, working together in mutually beneficial ways. (3) With everyone under the same organization and holding the same shareholder status, the disposal of foreign exchange earned from exports will naturally not be an issue. The foreign exchange needed for imports will still be handled by the private sector. Just like recovering what was lost, international trade can gradually prosper as a result, and the shortcomings of the import-export linkage system can be effectively remedied through collective efforts. (4) The government's current international trade policy aims to strictly control 　save foreign exchange, encourage exports, restrict imports, and maintain and expand international markets. The China Import and Export Joint Operations Company is well-suited to meet the government's expectations. The target of control becomes simpler rather than complex, which can achieve twice the results with half the effort. Secondly, the Joint Operations Company will use its own foreign exchange earnings to conduct import business. If it can develop fully, it will not only not have to rely on the government for foreign exchange supply, but the government can also request a portion of the foreign exchange from the company if it is in need. Thirdly, under a comprehensive business strategy, the Joint Operations Company will offset export losses with high import profits, focusing on practical matters rather than empty talk. This will not only make impossible exports possible and keep international markets from declining, achieving the goal of export promotion, but also boost imports, which will greatly benefit the continued industrial production of our country, the suppression of prices, and the balance of international payments.</p>
<p>Founding Characteristics: The founding characteristics of the company are as follows: (1) The Joint Operations Company should be an enterprise organized to break the deadlock for import and export businesses and seek mutual benefits, not a trust that monopolizes international trade. (2) The Joint Operations Company should be an open organization that takes into account the welfare of other industries, and should not be exclusive or exclusionary. Under this premise, the needs of Chinese industry and agriculture should be fully met. For example, finding outlets for the export of Chinese industrial and agricultural products, increasing imports of machinery and raw materials needed for construction and continued production, and absorbing overseas remittances and foreign deposits through imported materials. (3) The Joint Operations Company should assist the government's economic policies, increase national tax revenue, and support post-war economic construction policies to cultivate the foundation of the national economy, not create alternative paths outside of national policy. (4) With the aim of assisting import and export businesses, the Joint Operations Company adopts a mutual trust and joint operation system. It will bear the risk of international market price fluctuations for those engaging in export within the industry who have a commercial relationship with the company. Under the premise that they hand over their foreign exchange earnings to the Joint Operations Company, impossible exports become possible, and they can obtain reasonable profits. Those engaging in import can also be entrusted by the company to conduct import trade, without being threatened by domestic market price fluctuations, making difficult imports possible and obtaining reasonable profits. (5) The Joint Operations Company should be a purely people's enterprise, with its capital coming from the private sector.</p>

<h3>Geneva, 15th (Airmail) Zhuang Zhihuan: China as Seen from Europe</h3>
<p>I was fortunate to be sent to Europe at the beginning of March this year. I recall that my first trip abroad was in 1920, when I continued my studies in Europe and traveled to fourteen European countries during summer vacations. Twenty-three years have passed since I returned. At the same time, I was first sent as a young graduate to observe the situation after the First World War, compared to this time as a middle-aged man after more than twenty years of service observing the situation after the Second World War, my feelings and observations are very different. The peace conference could not be held immediately after the victory. The contradictions and conflicts between the countries, the scenes of intrigue and struggle, are still unfolding, all of which are affecting our country. Suffering China has sacrificed greatly in eight years of arduous resistance, originally hoping to compensate for everything after the victory. Who knew that the international status gained in the War of Resistance would fall sharply again, like a mute person eating bitter melon, unable to express the suffering! I set off on April 5th to rush to the Geneva conference on April 10th. The time was extremely tight. Now, I will write down my observations and opinions along the way, to provide readers with some review and reference materials.</p>
<p>"French Sky Island"</p>
<p>From Asia to Africa to Europe in five days.</p>
<p>I got up early on the 5th and rushed to Air France, then transferred to a large bus to Jiangwan Airport. Military airports usually cannot be entered without a pass; however, when the large bus arrived at the airport gate, the guard was stretching lazily, too tired to check the pass. Our country's "legislation must be strict, enforcement must be lenient" attitude, the guard's dereliction of duty is just another example of the sloppy character of the Chinese people and the failure of the rule of law. The French plane was named "French Sky Island" and looked exactly like the American transport planes parked next to it; they were originally from the same source, just adopted by someone else, so it is not surprising. However, the French are ultimately able to use it to organize an international flight network. At 7:00, the engine started, and at 7:20, it took off over Shanghai and the coastal provinces of China; looking down, the flat lands were all cultivated. The Chinese are the most industrious agricultural people, and farming is their forte, but apart from farming, they are not good at many other aspects of agriculture, such as forestry and animal husbandry; therefore, forests have been excessively cut down, and high slopes have been turned into terraced fields, making the soil more prone to deterioration. From the perspective of the nation's long-term interests, guidance and improvement are needed. In the past, Guanzhong was a fertile plain for thousands of miles, but now it is suffering from frequent droughts, and the yellow earth is cracked; the southeast coast has more rainfall, so it is naturally not so bad, but whether many slopes suitable for animal husbandry are worth being converted into farmland is still a big question. County governments are busy carrying out the orders of their superiors, and administrative expenses are even smaller. Which county magistrate has the leisure to investigate the geology and topography of his jurisdiction to guide farmers?</p>
<p>Flying over Hong Kong and Hainan Island, we entered Vietnam, and the primeval forests, rice fields, and rivers were clearly visible. Along the way, the seawater was like indigo, and the white clouds were like mountains, and gray clouds often passed between them; the same clouds, one moving and one still, the clouds changing in myriad ways, and the bottoms of the clouds were mostly flat. We on the ground do not have this feeling. At 4:00 PM, we arrived at Saigon Airport, a flight of about nine hours. In the air, you could wear an overcoat, but on the ground, you would sweat in a single shirt. The climate change was too drastic, which made travelers complain. Upon arrival, several procedures must be completed before reaching the hotel. The streets of Saigon are still quite orderly, but the streets are full of soldiers. It is said that the French army in Vietnam totals about 200,000, but other than in major cities, the French still do not dare to go.</p>
<p>A Short Stay in Saigon</p>
<p>I stayed in Saigon for a day on the 6th because Saigon is the end point of the French Far East air route, and the flight to Shanghai is an extension of this route. Saigon is a concentration of overseas Chinese, with a population of about 300,000, divided into Cantonese, Zhaoqing, Hainanese, Chaoshan, Fujian, and other groups. The above five groups each have their own organizations and compete with each other. There are Kuomintang branches and Youth Corps, and they also carry out their own activities. Disputes among overseas Chinese and the various struggles for position between the French and the Viet Minh often make it difficult for the local consulate general. Sometimes, hanging flags at gatherings becomes a big problem. To avoid disputes, only one flag is hung. The future of the French-Vietnamese issue is difficult, and our government's attitude towards France and Vietnam should be carefully considered, so as not to repeat the hasty signing of the Sino-French Agreement including Vietnam, which put our occupying forces accepting surrender in northern Vietnam in a dilemma.</p>
<p>At 6:30 AM on the 7th, I left the hotel to go to the airport. Among the few passengers, I boarded the plane after careful inquiry. At 7:30, it took off. At 9:00, it flew low over Angkor in Cambodia, circling once. The city was orderly, the architecture magnificent, but the deserted grass and palace ruins could only be imagined. According to archaeologists, this ancient palace, built of huge stones, was built by a resurgent and heroic ruler who believed in Buddhism and commemorated his queen, while also constructing his own image as a Buddha. It consumed money and manpower, eventually exhausting the country's power. There are still many such countries in the modern world, and we do not have time to mourn the already extinct Champs tribe!</p>
<p>Passing Yangon, it was already 11:45. The houses were densely packed, and the golden pagodas were dazzling. At 1:10 PM, we passed Akyab—the westernmost point reached by the Japanese army. At 3:00 PM, we arrived in Calcutta. Because we gained time every day as we traveled west, the local time was only 1:30 PM. It was very hot on the ground. I saw three China National Aviation Corporation planes at the airport, and the joy and excitement of seeing the national flag abroad can be imagined. After checking the immunization certificates and passports, we had a meal at the airport and rested for an hour before boarding the plane again. It gradually cooled down in the air. We flew between two layers of clouds, and the plane swayed and rocked in the wind. At night (10:00 PM local time), we arrived in Karachi, which was already brightly lit. After completing the inspection procedures, we went upstairs to the hotel room. I talked with Nguyen Van Hien in the plane: This man was the Grand Secretary in the Palace of Bao Dai, the abdicated emperor of Vietnam, and now he is sending his daughter to study in France, and is talking to his eldest son who works in Paris. He said that officials in the past were more respected by the people the more honest and incorruptible they were. Their affairs after death were handled by the government according to the circumstances. This is not as good as officials in recent times, who must seek compensation commensurate with their work. This is precisely the divergence between Eastern civilization and Western civilization. Calcutta and Karachi both have integrated land and air transport, which is better than Shanghai. Shanghai is the largest commercial port in China, but the failure to integrate land, sea, and air transport is a major shortcoming.</p>
<p>The Power of Examination and Constitutional Government</p>
<p>I got up at 5:00 AM on the 8th and boarded the plane at 6:10 AM, which took off immediately. The bright moon was still hanging high, and the misty air had not yet receded. Karachi was a place entrusted during the war. Its development was also during the war as a base for the Allied forces. Our expeditionary forces also trained here, but the land is very barren, and most of the hills are red and cannot be cultivated. Most of the buildings are old-style barracks.</p>
<p>Reading a magazine, I learned that Americans are criticizing their Congress, saying that members of Congress, in order to please voters, mostly fight for local interests and industry interests, regardless of the country's losses, which is one of the malpractices of parliamentary politics. In the past, our country's politicians were selected by examination to serve as officials, and they had to be in other provinces. This inherently had the meaning of the emperor maintaining his power, but the merit of maintaining great unity and making the rights and interests of the whole country and the whole people higher than private interests should not be ignored. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's use of five powers to replace three powers was also intended to remedy the evils of elections with examinations. Unfortunately, we have not made good use of this power of examination today, and only use the college entrance examination and the general examination as a kind of qualification for being promoted to official positions. It is still a concept of "becoming famous all over the world in one examination," "big selection of county magistrates," or "tiger class prefects and county magistrates," or a consciousness of being proud of presiding over examinations, how can it be truly thought of using the examination system to correct the abuses of elections? The implementation of constitutional government in our country is not far away, and our government should also pay attention to this issue.</p>
<p>Crossing the Arabian Desert</p>
<p>The plane flew along the coast of the Arabian Sea, crossed the Cape of Oman and entered the Persian Gulf. Most of the territory of Iran and Iraq was gray and yellow, without trees or flowers. Near Basra, the rivers were crisscrossed, the palm trees formed forests, and the deep green was interspersed with white Arabian-style buildings, creating a different kind of scenery. At 1:10 PM, we arrived at Basra Airport. This place has integrated land, sea, and air transport, with railways to Baghdad and several ships of 5,000 to 6,000 tons berthed. After getting off the plane, we ate at the station. The waiters were all Muslims, and we only ate beef and mutton. At 2:00 PM, we boarded the plane again, and at 2:40 PM, we took off (local time was 12:10 PM). When crossing the Arabian Desert, the plane shook constantly because the airflow on the desert was unstable. After flying for another forty minutes, we arrived in Cairo. After getting off the plane and going through immunization certificate and passport checks, the medical officers lined up the passengers in front of them, but they were still chatting and minding their own business, with a very arrogant attitude. Mr. Li Jiou, a military attache, was detained by the police because he was wearing a military uniform. Since the British army withdrew from Egypt on March 1, the Egyptians are now completely independent and self-satisfied, and no longer care about international etiquette. Humans often have complicated psychology, which is really pitiful and regrettable. Leaving the airport, we went to the hotel, which was magnificent and luxurious. The streets were also clean and tidy, and the city was bustling with traffic. This is a symbol of the British Empire's century of hard work. Once abandoned, it is no wonder that Churchill and his ilk were heartbroken. In a hurry, I also went with my traveling companions Qian Tang and Jun San to visit the pyramids and the Sphinx, and to admire the blue and slow-flowing Nile River. Flowing between the tall buildings on both banks, this pyramid and this river have gone through many vicissitudes, and Egypt is now independent again. The royal palace is decorated with neon crowns, which is a bit vulgar. It is said that the Egyptian government often hosts diplomatic personnel from various countries, and there are almost no empty evenings, or is it accustomed to the lingering traditions of French court diplomacy? Egypt is politically influenced by Britain and culturally influenced by France, with a deeper influence. French can be used in Cairo. Unfortunately, the pronunciation of the average Egyptian is special, and their French and English are not easy to understand. All shops and institutions are marked in Arabic, and car license plates are also listed in Arabic. In fact, the numbers used are Arabic, but they have been simplified. Men have mostly retained their flat-topped red and black hats, and some still wear long robes, but they have all changed to Western suits. Most women wear Egyptian clothes, but the face veils have been removed, which is no longer the scene of twenty years ago. There are about forty overseas Chinese in Egypt, mostly peddlers of national goods such as silk and silk fabrics. Now that the goods have no source, they have all become homeless, and our government should find a way to send them back to their country.</p>
<p>From the Mediterranean to Paris</p>
<p>I started at 2:00 AM on April 9th. After completing the inspection procedures at the airport, I took off at 3:00 AM, traveling along the African coast. The bright moon was on the left, and the white clouds were piled up. At 6:00, the sun rose, and the rays of light shone on the cloud peaks, forming a spectacular sight. At 8:00, we passed Malta Island. Looking down, the four walls were steep, and the flat land was all cultivated. The transportation roads were like spider webs. The ability of this small place to resist the German bombing and attack and to persevere to the end is actually related to the strategic situation in the Mediterranean and the victory or defeat of the war. At 9:30, we arrived in Tunis, a city in French North Africa, all green, with mountains and lakes, with abundant land and rich production. We rested for an hour, and it rained heavily, which is said to happen only ten times a year. We were lucky to encounter it.</p>
<p>Crossing the Mediterranean Sea</p>
<p>When the plane crossed the Mediterranean Sea, it was all 　　. I discussed the various troubles of crossing borders and customs with the two Catholic priests (one American and one French) on the same plane, wondering when it would be possible to achieve "one family under heaven"? Unexpectedly, they immediately replied that it was never possible. From this, we can see the basic difference between Eastern and Western cultures. In the eyes of Easterners, their concept of power is not as profound as that of Europeans and Americans, so in spirit, they believe that it is possible to gradually form a unified world from small to large, from oneself to family to country to the world. Moreover, religious figures believe in one God and take teaching people and persuading people to do good as their duty, but they also do not believe that "one family under heaven" is possible. At 12:07, we saw Marseille. The weather was cold and the air was condensed. We saw the rivers, railways, cities, and farms within France. At 3:00, we arrived at the Bourget Airport in Paris. This place was originally a military airport and served as a base for the recapture of Paris. Now it is a commercial airport. Because France lacks resources and has inflation, there are many smugglers. Customs inspection of passengers' luggage and declaration of foreign currency entering the country are particularly strict, but customs officials also accept bribes and simplify procedures. I personally saw a person bribing customs officials with cigarettes (French cigarettes are a state-run business, so foreign cigarettes have become valuable), and they were exempted from inspection.</p>
<p>It has been more than twenty years since I arrived in Paris. As I entered the city, it took me a long time to recognize it accurately. I arrived at the "Prince of Wales" hotel booked by our embassy in France, which was beautiful and clean, and the staff could all speak English, which proves the great power of English. The elevator operator wore many medals on his chest. When asked, he was 65 years old and still a hero of the First World War. He had many feelings about the current situation, especially the high cost of living. After the victory of the war, all countries and nations are in hardship and distress, and international conferences are frequent, but the dawn of peace has not yet appeared. Compared with the ability to hold a peace conference as soon as possible after the First World War, the scene is even more tragic and deplorable.</p>
<h3>The Embryo of the Hangzhou-Yongjia Railway</h3>
<p>— Hangzhou, 27th Fast News Dispatch by Our Special Correspondent, Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>If there were no wars across the country, then the construction projects within Zhejiang Province might not be proceeding so quickly and smoothly. Take the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, for instance. Many of these steel rails were originally needed for railways in Central China, North China, and the Northeast, but because war is raging there, most of them can be used for the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Take water conservancy projects, for example. Originally, water conservancy projects were to be undertaken all over the country, and there would not be enough water conservancy experts to go around. Now, Zhejiang has many experts in permanent benefit projects. Shouldn't Zhejiang be congratulated for this? The people and officials of Zhejiang should seize this opportunity and catch up! Shen Chengzhang, the Chairman of Zhejiang Province, once had detailed and grand construction plans. The most important of these was to dredge the Qiantang River and use its water power for various construction projects. Another was to connect the transportation of the two Zhejiangs, complete the Zhejiang railway network, and build the Hangzhou-Yongjia Railway. Shen once said that if these two things were accomplished, he would die content. With this spirit to engage in the construction of Zhejiang, we should wish him success in advance.</p>
<p>Hangzhou-Yongjia Railway Should Follow Route</p>
<p>There has already been much discussion about the funds, and the Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau has already been established. The initial steps for harnessing the Qiantang River have already begun. As for the Hangzhou-Yongjia Railway, it is still in the planning stage. We might as well say it is in its embryonic stage. The reporter would like to describe everything about this embryo:</p>
<p>Although Zhejiang Province is called a province with progress in various undertakings, due to the obstruction of mountains and rivers between eastern and western Zhejiang, it takes a very long time to get from western Zhejiang to eastern Zhejiang. It is actually faster to go via Shanghai, sail south by sea, and then travel upstream by inland river. Therefore, from the point of view of transportation, it is not yet an ideal situation. Shen Chengzhang then proposed the construction of the Hangzhou-Yongjia Railway. The so-called "Hang" and "Yong" refer to Hangzhou and Yongjia, respectively. Yongjia, formerly known as Wenzhou, is a major port on the coast of Zhejiang. After Shen reported this to the central government, he requested the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau to survey the route on his behalf. Those ordered to conduct the survey prepared in early February, departed from Hangzhou on the 18th, and completed the survey on April 3rd.</p>
<p>The route of the Hangzhou-Yongjia Railway could originally go through Shaoxing, Pingshui, Wangcheng, Yi'lai, Fengtianling, and then south along a tributary of the Yan Stream, passing through Wuyan, Chengtan, Shuangxikou, Wangduli, and then reaching Majia Stream, directly to the foot of Houshiling, and then south along Jia Stream and Zhanshanmao Stream to Tiantai, and then from Tiantai to Yongjia. It could also go from Cao'e, Shengxian, change course along the eastward-flowing Yan Stream to reach Xinchang, and then to Banzhu, near Houjiang, and then along another small stream to Wangduli, and then reaching Majia Stream, directly to the foot of Houshiling, and then south along Jia Stream and Zhanshanmao Stream to Tiantai, and then from Tiantai to Yongjia. However, according to the surveyors, the construction of the above two routes is larger and will take longer. There are many places where tunnels need to be built, and the shortest tunnel is still two kilometers long. The production of silk, tea, tobacco, wood, and other products along the route has decreased sharply in recent years, and there is also a lack of large amounts of mineral resources. Whether from an engineering or economic standpoint, there is no reason to adopt these two routes. According to the surveyors' proposal, the Hangzhou-Yongjia Railway should follow the Hangzhou-Ningbo Road from Ningbo Bridge, cross the Yuyao River, and then follow the left bank of the Yin River, passing through Jieshe, Jiangkou, to Fenghua. From Fenghua, it should go south, passing through Fangmen, Xikou, Fuxi, bypassing Yangmeiling and then south, passing through Meilin, Guanzhuang, reaching Ninghai, and then west, passing Jianxi, to Huangtan Street, and then through Guxiu Ridge, reaching Liangwang Street and further south, passing through Daxiwang, to near Bailiang Bridge, crossing the Bai Stream. After this, it must gradually ascend along the hillside to Sangzhou Ridge, then turn southeast, follow Yong Stream, and after passing Heliu Town, turn south, cross Tongpan Ridge, and then turn west to reach Haiyou Town. Afterwards, it should go upstream along the Zhu Stream, passing south of Zhuao, and then west to Jiaoshi and Hengtou Dai, and further to near Tingtouzhai, then follow the Shifeng Stream upwards directly to Tiantai. This section requires a tunnel to be built in Sangzhou Ridge, about 340 meters long; a large bridge needs to be built on the Yuyao River, but it is easier to build than the two inland routes. Therefore, the surveyors plan to adopt this route. From Ningbo, passing through Fenghua, Ninghai, Haiyou to near Tingtouzhai, the route must be divided into two lines, one to Tiantai County, which is called the Tiantai branch line, and one following the Shifeng Stream south, which is the main line. The main line passes through Zhongdu, Chimu, Shifoyang to Linhai, and in the vicinity of Linhai County, it crosses the Shilai Stream, changes course to the right bank and goes down to Sandong Bridge and Changdian, still goes down along the river bank, reaches near Jiangkou Town, and crosses the Yongning River, but at this point the river is about 700 meters wide, or the route may be extended to near Huangyan to cross the river. After crossing the Yongning River, the route is divided into an eastward line to Haimen, which is the Haimen branch line, and a southeastward line through Luqiao, Muxu, Hengfeng Bridge, Wenling Street, which is the main line, and then goes along the coast, then passes through the south of Huwu and Dajing, and Baixi Street to reach Qingjiangdu, where a large bridge needs to be built, then passes through Longzhailing, which can be opened up, and reaches Hongqiao Town, then passes through Yueqing County, goes south to the west of Liushi and Guantou, and then turns west and goes upstream along the north bank of the Ou River, directly to Gangtou opposite Yongjia. The entire route can be divided into two stages. From Ningbo to Ninghai, it is about 83 kilometers. From Ninghai via Haiyou to Tiantai, it is about 83 kilometers. From Tiantai to Haimen, it is about 84 kilometers. The total length is 250 kilometers, which is planned as the first stage. From Jiangkou to Qingjiangdu, it is about 73 kilometers, and from Qingjiangdu to Gangtou, it is about 62 kilometers. The total length is 135 kilometers, which is planned as the second stage. The total length of the entire line is 385 kilometers.</p>
<p>Three Reasons for Choosing the Route</p>
<p>The reasons for adopting this route for the Hangzhou-Yongjia Railway are: (1) The coastal area has a dense population, rich products, and famous scenic spots such as Tiantai and Yandang, which can attract tourists and increase business income. (2) Xiangshan Port, Sanmen Bay, Yueqing Bay, and other natural military, commercial, and fishing harbors urgently need to be renovated and developed, and they must rely on railway supplies and cultivation. (3) This route is just the necessary coastal line between the two major ports, East and South, in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's plan. If this road is completed, it will directly strengthen national defense, develop industry and commerce, and indirectly promote the realization of the coastal line between the two major ports in the plan. All counties along the line mainly produce grain. Other products include Yinxian's mat grass and flour, Fenghua's bamboo, wood, firewood, and charcoal, Yongjia's canned goods, Ninghai's wood, bamboo, fish, and seaweed, Sanmen's cotton, hemp, coal, zinc, iron, and fish, Tiantai's tung oil, firewood, sulfur, quartz, and iron, Linhai's cotton, hemp, native silk, cloth, fish, lime, and fluorite, Huangyan's aquatic vegetables and fish, Wenling's cotton, cigarettes, pottery, and fish, Yueqing's fish, and Yongjia's vegetable oil, oranges, tea, tobacco silk, cotton thread, wax paper, medicine, umbrellas, cigarettes, and matches.</p>
<p>Countless Scenic Spots Along the Line</p>
<p>The scenic spots along the line include the famous Tiantong Temple in the territory of Yin County, which began in the Jin Dynasty, and contains the scenic spots of Guanyin Cave and Linglong Rock, about 60 li from the city. In the territory of Zhenhai County, there is the Yuwang Temple, which began in the time of King Li of Zhou, and the Dongqian Lake, which is 18 li wide, with many peaks standing and containing seventy-two streams; in the territory of Fenghua, there are Xuedou Temple, Qianzhangyan, Miaogao Terrace, Yintan, Jinping Mountain, Zhongta, Yuelin Temple, etc.; Ninghai has the Yuelong Mountain, where Ming Dynasty sage Fang Zhengxue studied, the Zhuwo Bing Pavilion, where the remains of Fang Zhengxue's relatives were buried, the Cimu Stone, where Luo Shi cried for his mother, and the Shijing Hermitage Temple, where Fang Zhengxue began his studies; Sanmen has the ancient Guangrun Temple of the Jin Dynasty, the Chikan, the righteous homeland of Fang Guozhen of the Ming Dynasty, the Chema Ferry, where Emperor Gaozong of the Song Dynasty crossed the river, Yuan Sheng Xi Lai, where Zhang Cangshui was martyred, and the Sanmen tides between the three mountains, etc. Tiantai has eight scenic spots, the magnificent Guoqing Temple, the Chicheng Mountain where Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty celebrated the New Year, the Huading Temple where the East China Sea can be viewed, the Baijing Terrace, the Fangguang Temple with the Stone Liang Flying Waterfall, the Wannian Temple with many ancient artifacts bestowed by emperors of past dynasties, the Luoxi Fishing Rod, known as Shitong, the Tongbai Palace where Boyi and Shuqi starved to death, the Hanyan Mingyue, where 30,000 troops can be stationed in the cave, as well as Xianren Zuo, Qingxi Luoyan, and Duanqiao Jixue, etc.; Linhai has the Jinzi Mountain, Longgu Mountain, Jinshan Mountain, Baifeng Mountain and other scenic spots, Huangyan has the Jiufeng Mountain where Zhu Xi of the Song Dynasty once lectured; Liushi has the Danyai where Ge Xian is said to have cultivated Taoism, and Yueqing has the famous Yandang Mountain, which is famous at home and abroad. The peaks of this mountain are steep and strange, soaring thousands of feet, and densely piercing the sky. There is a lake on the top of the mountain, ten li in circumference, the water does not dry up, and when the spring geese return, they often roost here; the mountain has east, west, inner and outer valleys, the east outer valley has five peaks, the east inner valley has forty-eight peaks, and the west inner and outer valleys have twenty-four peaks. There are eighteen temples built, each with a different name. The peaks have stone walls hundreds of feet high, flying waterfalls thousands of feet high, and a huge abyss formed by the confluence of streams. On the side of the abyss, the stone railing has a cave like a well, deep and immeasurable, and other strange sights; Yongjia has Rongshan, Tuotou Ancient Temple, etc.</p>
<p>All Parties Estimate a Three-Year Payback</p>
<p>According to the surveyors' report: The first phase, from Ningbo to Haimen, is 250 kilometers, including general affairs, preparation, land purchase, roadbed construction, tunnels, bridge construction, route protection, telegraph and telephone, track, signals and switches, stations and houses, machinery, vehicles, maintenance and other expenses. The domestic materials and labor costs are estimated at 154.12645 million yuan, and the foreign materials are estimated at 7.11205 million US dollars. The second phase, from Haimen to Yongjia, is 135 kilometers, including the same expenses as the first phase. The domestic materials and labor costs are estimated at 91.88145 million yuan, and the foreign materials are estimated at 4.17348 million US dollars. In total, the entire project requires a total of 246 million yuan in national currency and 7.9 million yuan, and a total of 11.28553 million US dollars. According to the official price of 12,000 yuan in legal currency per US dollar, it is 135.42636 million yuan. The total is 381.43426 million yuan in national currency. The railway operating income is determined by referring to the national railway fare, with passenger transport at 40 yuan per person per kilometer. The estimated total number of passengers from Ningbo to Haimen is 2.6827 million, and the total number of passengers on the entire Ningbo-Yongjia line is 4.0442 million. The total annual passenger revenue for Ninghai is 171.6928 million yuan, and the total revenue for the entire line is 258.8288 million yuan. Furthermore, referring to the national railway freight rate of 60 yuan per ton-kilometer, assuming that the annual income of the first phase of Ninghai is 51 million yuan, and the entire line is 57.18 million yuan. If the total income from passenger and freight transport is assumed to be as above, then it is a total of 538.5216 million yuan. If this number is followed, then the principal can be repaid in six years. However, this estimate is for the first year, and it is also estimated that the entire project can be completed in the first year. If the entire project can be completed on schedule in the first year, it is believed that the operating income in the second year will definitely double, and then the principal may be repaid in less than three years.</p>
<p>Form the Embryo and Promote Its Birth</p>
<p>The main problem now is that the Zhejiang Provincial Government is determined to do this, but does not have the money. Some people suggest issuing public bonds, and the provincial government is carefully planning this. In fact, the figure of 30 million yuan only requires a few far-sighted wealthy merchants to donate it. I personally know that there are many wealthy merchants in Shanghai who spend more than ten million yuan on a single banquet. I see that they have no less than 200 banquets a year, and there are more than a thousand such wealthy merchants in Shanghai. Then, they only need to save the banquets. However, in China today, no one is willing to do things without rights. For example, issuing public bonds, the Chinese people are simply not interested in public bonds. And although the allocation of public bonds is taken by wealthy merchants, the wealthy merchants then allocate them to the lower levels, and the lower levels then allocate them to the lower levels. In the end, it is still the poor and loyal farmers who bear this responsibility. I suggest that if the government cannot raise the money to do this for a while, and if public bonds cannot be issued, then it is better to do it under official supervision and commercial management. There are many such examples in the United States. Today's China, I think this can also be done, perhaps it can reduce the improper activities of hot money, and the current economic situation will be slightly more stable.</p>
<p>Time is of the essence, and now is the best opportunity for Zhejiang's construction. Since there is already an embryo, which was already in February of this year, then according to the usual human birth, it can be born nine months later. Of course, a huge undertaking cannot be compared with a human birth, but in October of this year, we all hope to see its construction begin.</p>

<h3>How Should Shanghai Port Be Developed?</h3>
<p>— Shi Konghuai</p>
<p>The main conditions for the establishment of a port are: first, it must have sufficient depth so that import and export ships can navigate without hindrance; second, it must have natural or artificial barriers to protect ships from wind and waves. In addition, to facilitate the docking of ships, there should be pier facilities; to facilitate the loading and unloading of goods, there should be loading and unloading equipment; to facilitate the storage of goods, there should be warehouse construction; to facilitate the distribution of goods, there should be convenient transportation to connect with domestic and foreign countries. However, the prosperity of a port depends purely on the condition of its hinterland. Shanghai is located at the mouth of the Yangtze River, with the Yangtze River basin, which has abundant products, an area of 750,000 square miles (half of mainland China), and a population of 200 million, as its hinterland. In terms of the coast, Shanghai is the starting and ending point of north-south ocean shipping. Since it was opened as a commercial port in the 22nd year of Daoguang of the former Qing Dynasty (1842), after more than 100 years of continuous human effort, the population has reached more than 4.5 million, factories are densely packed, trade is prosperous, and the amount of production and consumption is considerable. Therefore, Shanghai's superior position and possible future development are unmatched by any port in the world. It is appropriate that before the war, the annual import and export trade volume was nearly 50% of the total national import and export trade volume, and its import and export ship tonnage reached 40 million tons, making it the ninth largest port in the world.</p>
<p>In 1946, Shanghai's import and export ship statistics were 14 million tons. If there had been no US seafarers' strike in the second half of the year, its tonnage would have increased, but it would not have exceeded 20 million tons. Since Shanghai port could accommodate 40 million tons before the war, why is it that after the war, ships were less than 20 million tons, and the port became congested? The reasons are nothing more than: (1) the docks damaged during the war have not been completely repaired; (2) most of the floating docks that were taken away by the enemy for use have not been recovered and replenished; (3) the enemy and puppet goods stored in the warehouses have not been completely cleared; (4) the loading and unloading of goods is slow; (5) some docks are silted up; (6) some dock pontoons are designated for military use. However, the above situations are all temporary phenomena, and after a considerable period of time, they can be gradually improved, and there is no doubt that the pre-war throughput capacity will be restored.</p>
<p>This time, the Anti-Japanese War was victorious, and the homeland was restored, but the losses suffered by our country's materials during the war were enormous. Therefore, after the war, we were busy with repatriation and relief, and there was no spare energy to engage in active construction for a while, let alone economic prosperity. However, construction is the key to our country's future survival, and the start of construction cannot be delayed. Once it starts, the required equipment will be large, and anything that cannot be supplied domestically must be obtained from abroad. After construction, if the domestic market cannot absorb our country's production materials, we must promote them abroad. Therefore, even if Shanghai port recovers to its pre-war capacity, it will still feel insufficient to meet the needs. According to past statistics, Shanghai's import and export ship tonnage has doubled every 30 years, which can be taken as proof. Furthermore, domestic and foreign人士 all agree that if our country's political and economic situation is stable, Shanghai port will be listed alongside New York and London as a major port in the world. Therefore, how should Shanghai port be developed in order to shoulder this important mission? This is a crucial issue. I would like to offer the following points for discussion:</p>
<p>(1) Water Depth Issues</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the entry and exit of ships, the port water surface must have an appropriate depth. According to economic principles, the larger the ship's deadweight, the lower the transportation cost. However, the larger the ship's deadweight, the deeper its draft must be. Therefore, the International Shipping Conference has stipulated that the standard water depth for ports should be 48 feet. The water depth of New York port, the Suez Canal, and the Panama Canal are all around 40 feet. The shallowest water depth of the Shanghai Huangpu River channel is 26 feet below the lowest water level. During high flood season, the tide height is 8 feet, which can give a water depth of 34 feet. During low flood season, the tide height is 6 feet, which can give a water depth of 32 feet. The draft of ocean-going ships entering and leaving Shanghai port is usually from 24 feet to 18 feet, but there are also many ships with a draft of more than 30 feet. The postal ship President Coolidge with a draft of 31 feet 6 inches entered Shanghai port in 1941, and the oil tanker Walden with a draft of 32 feet 1 inch entered Shanghai port in 1937. It can be seen that although the current water depth of Shanghai port can cope with the situation, it is still far from the 40 feet water depth generally used by major ports in the world. In the near future, the export volume of our country's industrial and agricultural products will increase, and the quantity of imports and exports will gradually balance out. The increase in the draft of Shanghai's import and export ships is to be expected. Therefore, the Huangpu River Conservancy Bureau plans to deepen the Shentan of the Yangtze River estuary to 37 feet during low high tide in the near future, and to deepen the Huangpu River channel to 30 feet below the lowest water level, so that ships with a draft of 33 feet can enter and exit conveniently, and then gradually deepen it according to actual needs, in order to benefit navigation and business.</p>
<p>(2) Port Layout Issues</p>
<p>Docks are the necessary equipment for ships to dock. In the future, as the number of ships increases, docks must be added. According to the construction of docks, there are three types: protruding, recessed, and parallel. Protruding docks are built protruding from the river bank towards the river, such as the docks on both banks of the Hudson River in New York. However, the river is more than a mile wide, so although the docks on both banks are 1,200 feet long, there is still a width of 3,000 feet in the middle of the river channel, which can be used as a turning area for navigation. The width of the lower reaches of the Huangpu River is only 2,000 feet, so protruding docks cannot be used. Recessed docks are built by excavating from the shore, such as the docks in London, Liverpool, and Hamburg. The advantage of this type of dock is that it can increase the length of the dock by several times with a limited shoreline, and its effect is the same as that of protruding docks, this is one. In addition, it is extremely inconvenient for ships to load and unload goods in places where the water level varies greatly. Therefore, recessed docks are usually used when the water level difference is more than 12 feet, and ship locks are built to maintain the water level and facilitate loading and unloading. Ships are required to enter and exit at high tide, this is two. Parallel docks are built along the coast parallel to the shore, and Shanghai has always used this type of design. Whether to follow the old practice in the future or adopt other methods, the opinions of people in the society are quite divided. Some advocate that Shanghai port should be thoroughly re-planned, abolishing the areas on both sides of the Puxi and Pudong as dock and warehouse areas, and choosing other places such as Wusong Rihuigang to build recessed docks. The main reason is that the docking of ships along the Huangpu River will easily cause street traffic congestion due to the movement of goods. In addition, recessed docks are equipped with railways, which can enable combined rail-water transportation and increase transportation efficiency. This issue can be studied from the aspects of transportation economics and shoreline. The water level difference of Shanghai port is usually no more than 8 feet. According to the opinions of shipping companies, entering and leaving parallel docks is considered to be the most convenient. As for combined rail-water transportation, there is no difference in efficiency between building all the railway tracks behind the parallel docks and building them above the recessed docks. Furthermore, the Huangpu River, from the Zhangjiatang upstream port boundary line to the Wusongkou downstream port boundary line, is 23 miles long, which means that the shoreline on both sides is 46 miles long, and only half of it is currently used and developed. In particular, the undeveloped and usable shoreline on both sides from the Qiujiang Wharf to the Wusongkou is sufficient for expansion in the next few decades. Before the war, the docks were concentrated near the concession due to concession relations. In the future, it would be most reasonable to develop towards Wusong. According to past statistics, 40% of Shanghai's imported goods are re-exported to coastal and riverine areas. These goods can be unloaded in the lower reaches of the Huangpu River and transferred to river and sea ships or trains for export, without having to dock at wharves in the central area, reducing port congestion. In October 1946, a comparison was made of the construction costs of recessed and parallel docks. Assuming that 4,000 feet of docks were built, the construction cost of parallel docks was 11.7 billion legal tender, while the construction cost of recessed docks was 17.1 billion, a difference of 5.4 billion. In other words, the construction cost of recessed docks is about 50% higher than that of parallel docks. Not only that, but parallel docks can be built in deep water areas, without the need for annual dredging. On the contrary, according to past statistics, recessed docks silt up to 5 feet per year. Therefore, the annual dredging cost is more than 500 million yuan. This increased cost will be borne by ships and goods, which is tantamount to increasing the price of goods. Furthermore, in the past, a considerable amount of Shanghai's imported goods were directly unloaded from ships to barges and transferred to riverside factories and warehouses, and less was transferred from ships to docks and then to trucks. If the current docks are scattered along the Huangpu River, and cargo trucks are already considered to be obstructing traffic, then after the adoption of recessed docks, ships will be concentrated in several places for loading and unloading goods, and the congestion at the main roads that trucks must pass will be even more severe. Based on the above arguments, the following considerations can be made for the layout of Shanghai port in the future:</p>
<p>(1) The Huangpu River is the lifeline of Shanghai port. The deep water areas on both sides of the Huangpu River should be utilized as much as possible to maintain and expand parallel docks, especially the area below the Qiujiang Wharf as the future development target location.</p>
<p>(2) If the shoreline required for parallel docks is indeed insufficient in a few decades, then the construction of recessed docks should be considered. The land on both sides below the Qiujiang Wharf should be reserved in advance, with a width of 3,000 feet from the shore.</p>
<p>(3) Cargo Loading and Unloading Equipment Issues</p>
<p>The faster the loading and unloading of cargo on ships, the shorter the time they stay in the port, which means that the effective sailing time for cargo can be increased. Therefore, the equipment for loading and unloading cargo in the port should be studied extensively. Before the war, labor in Shanghai was cheap. For economic reasons, it was utilized as much as possible, so that there was almost no mechanical equipment on the docks. The efficiency of cargo loading and unloading in a seaport is measured by the number of tons of cargo that can be loaded and unloaded per foot of dock per year. In 1924, Shanghai unloaded 285 tons of cargo per foot of dock, which was better than New York's 150 tons per foot of dock per year. The reason for this is that passenger ships and postal ships in New York travel frequently, these ships carry more passengers and less cargo, and secondly, the shipping companies in New York have not made full use of the docks they have leased to berth ships. However, compared with the record of 1,500 tons of cargo unloaded per foot of dock per year at the Marseille docks, the efficiency of Shanghai port is far behind. At the same time, the current labor cost in Shanghai is almost the highest in the world. In order to increase port efficiency and reduce transportation costs, all docks should be mechanized. However, some loading and unloading workers will inevitably lose their jobs as a result. This is a social problem that should be considered in advance.</p>
<p>(4) Combined Water, Land, and Air Transportation Issues</p>
<p>After foreign imported goods arrive in Shanghai, in addition to a portion being absorbed locally, 40% must be transshipped to other parts of our country. For export goods, the opposite is true: they are concentrated in Shanghai from various places and then exported from the port. Shanghai is the hub of water, land, and air transportation, and its relationship is important. It is necessary to ensure that ocean-going ships are closely connected with our country's river ships, sea ships, railways, highways, and airplanes. Therefore, the docks to be built in the future must not only be equipped with railways and highways to connect with the main lines, but also have close connections with airports. General psychology believes that air transport has a small capacity and high freight rates, and is often neglected, but air transport is fast. Shanghai will soon be one of the important stations in the world's air transport network. The layout of the airport and the connection with the docks should be equally emphasized to achieve the goal of convenient collection and distribution of goods and reduce warehouse congestion.</p>
<p>(5) Traffic Issues on Both Sides of the Huangpu River</p>
<p>The Huangpu River is one of the important assets of Shanghai port, and the deep water areas on both sides should be utilized as much as possible to build docks, as mentioned earlier. However, how to transport the goods unloaded in Pudong that need to be used in Puxi, or need to be transshipped to both sides of the Puxi River, is a point worth studying. The current method of transportation is to use barges. This is not inconvenient if the storage or use location of the goods is close to the riverbank. If it is far from the shore, vehicles must be used for transshipment, which requires additional loading and unloading procedures. Therefore, a simple solution is: one is to build bridges over the Huangpu River. However, if low bridges are built, bridge piers must be built in the middle of the river line on both sides, which will inevitably change the river system and damage the Huangpu River dredging project. Even if the middle part of the bridge can be moved to allow ships to pass, it will still hinder free navigation. If high bridges are built, the bridge surface must be more than 135 feet above the water surface. There is no obstacle for ships to pass under the bridge, but the approach bridges are too long and require a lot of land. This is obviously difficult in busy areas. The second is to build a tunnel 90 feet below the water surface of the Huangpu River, which will not hinder the Huangpu River or ship navigation, and the approach road does not need to be as long as the approach bridge, which is the most ideal. In places as far away as under the Thames River in London, under the Elbe River in Hamburg, and as close as under the Hudson River in New York, under the Mersey River in Liverpool, and under the Schlde River in Antwerp, tunnels have been built, which can be taken as evidence. However, the construction of tunnels requires sufficient time for surveying, design, fundraising, and so on. It seems that the car ferries planned to be built by the municipal ferry company should be actively built and expanded in various places. In the future, a low bridge with a movable middle hole can also be built near the new Longhua Railway Station, so that the railway tracks can be extended to the Gaogiao area of Pudong, forming a ring port railway, so that railways can share part of the responsibility for short- and long-distance cross-river freight transportation.</p>
<p>(6) Management Issues</p>
<p>The efficiency of a port depends not only on the perfection of its equipment, but also on its management. The management methods of ports in various countries often vary depending on their historical background, political system, and economic environment. In the United States, laws are passed by Congress, and state governors appoint and people elect representatives to organize committees to handle port affairs, such as the ports of New York, Boston, and New Orleans. However, river and marine engineering, quarantine, and customs work related to waterways are still the responsibility of the federal government. Furthermore, the docks in New York and Philadelphia are managed separately by the municipal government. There are also port public companies in the United States, authorized by Congress, and representatives elected by local people to manage port affairs. Their scope is not very large, such as Oregon and Portiand in California. In the United Kingdom, the seaport autonomy system is popular. Laws are formulated by Congress, the central government appoints committee members, local council agencies elect representatives, and companies and people who pay taxes to the port elect representatives to organize committees to handle waterway, dock, warehouse, loading and unloading and other businesses. It is worth noting that the number of elected representatives is greater than the number of appointed representatives, which is a major feature of port management methods. Shanghai port adopts a division of labor and cooperation method for its management. The control of the port is the responsibility of the Jianghai Customs; the security of the port is jointly handled by the port police of the Jianghai Customs and the water police of the municipal government; quarantine is handled by the quarantine office of the Health Department; the dredging of the Huangpu River is the responsibility of the Huangpu River Conservancy Bureau; and the docks and warehouses are operated by Chinese and foreign merchants. The number of public docks and warehouses is limited. In order to establish close connections, the Port Affairs Reorganization Committee was established in October last year to promote port efficiency. Whether to proceed to centralize the organization and unify management in the future, like the port affairs of London and Liverpool, remains to be discussed and decided. In short, the local government believes that port affairs in a place are local in nature and should be managed by the local government. The central government believes that the function of the port has a huge impact on the country's foreign trade and international navigation, exceeding the scope of the local area, and should be managed by the central government. The port organizations of London and Liverpool can be called democratic, taking into account the interests of the central government, local government, shipping companies, and exporters, which is worth studying.</p>

<h3>Soviet Literature in America</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Ernest J. Simmons is the chairman of the American-Soviet Association, a professor of Soviet literature in the Slavic Department at Columbia University, and has written monographs on Dostoevsky, Pushkin, and Tolstoy. Recently, he wrote a book review introducing the newly translated American versions of Gorky's "Orphan Paul" and a newly edited collection of Tolstoy's novellas. In addition, America has recently published a collection of Gorky's plays.</p>
<p>"Orphan Paul" is a collection of novellas, and also includes an unfinished manuscript "How I Became a Writer," all of which have been translated into English for the first time. Realism is not based on Turgenev, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy, but on Gorky. Orphan Paul, originally named "The Unfortunate Pavel," was published by Gorky in 1894 in a newspaper in Nizhny Novgorod when he first began writing literature. It had not been noticed by biographers and critics for many years. It was not until the Soviet Union held a 10th anniversary commemoration of Gorky's death last year that they paid attention to this work.</p>
<p>Like many of Gorky's early novels, this novel is about childhood and boyhood memories, writing about the poor environment of his grandfather's family, the childhood labor, the strange employers, and his love for birds and nature. In fact, Paul is, in some ways, an avatar of Gorky. His particular loneliness and introspection, as well as his pure ideal of harlots, show that there is something of himself in it. Paul was raised by the woman-hater Arifey, whose character is a mixture of police and religion. Later, Arifey's mind becomes unbalanced, suffering from holiness and sin, and finally enters a mental hospital, where he dies. Later, Paul becomes an apprentice under a drunken shoemaker. He gradually grows up, distrusting people, especially women—Arifey taught him that women are the root of all evil. However, he meets the prostitute Natalya, which adds vitality to his life, removes the loneliness of his daily life, and ensures a happy future. The story to this point can be said to have the fragrance of "Man郎攝什戈" (likely a typo or reference I can't find a direct translation for, possibly a book or poem). Paul proposes to her, but she is not used to this kind of rigid life and does not agree to the marriage. As a result, she falls into the gloom of Dostoevsky's novels, like the murderer in "The Idiot," Paul kills the prostitute.</p>
<p>"Tolstoy's Novellas" is a praiseworthy book in the "Dial Permanent Library" series, just like the previously published "Dostoevsky's Novellas." This volume includes "The Cossacks," "The Death of Ivan Ilyich," "The Snowstorm," and "Family Happiness," using Aylmer Maude's translation. However, masterpieces such as "The Devil," "Polikushka," and "Master and Man" are not included, apparently due to space limitations. The editor, Philip Rahv, pointed out that Tolstoy's style is true and simple, without mystery or sentimentality, and what is expressed in the novel is life itself.</p>
<h3>To Dispel Sorrow with Music and Books</h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<h3>"Cutting Smoke" Self-Preface</h3>
<p>— Sikong Wuji</p>
<p>I cannot repress my emotions; I love to gaze afar at the curling village smoke, I love to look up at the spreading white clouds, I love to stand alone on the mountaintop in a daze, gazing at the misty, shifting miasma below. Filled with compassionate tears, I foolishly face the dreamlike world.</p>
<p>Once, I borrowed a mirror from my soul and looked into my own heart. What was there? – Clouds, dense fog; wisps of blue smoke. Enveloping a seemingly eternal mystery of life.</p>
<p>Thus, I felt lost and even melancholic. However, I could not bear to endure it, so I wearily lay on the ground, opened the lid of my soul, and let the clouds and dense fog transform into wisps of blue smoke; drifting, drifting, slowly drifting away.</p>
<p>How I longed to see what was hidden behind the clouds and dense fog!</p>
<p>Thus, I impetuously threw many innocent questions into the worldly and mercenary world. But I never expected that it would arouse the disgust of many people with excessive fastidiousness. So, I was imprisoned, drifted about, and struggled on the line of death... inexplicably accepting a great deal of undeserved pain.</p>
<p>There was a time when I suspected I had lost the elasticity of life—I even thought of leaving this world of suffering. It was love (what a tremendous force it is!) that saved me from utter despair. I thought of the deceased Ye Zi, and the reserved Lu Yan; I realized that escape was never a good solution to pain.</p>
<p>So, I decided to live well again. Due to the rise of this hope for a new life, I began to realize that there was a glimmer of light faintly flashing in my heart; like a firefly on a summer night, shining brightly; how precious this little bit of light was in the darkness! Some say that it is the sun of my hope. Yes, I sincerely hope that the sun will drive away the melancholy in my heart—those clouds and that dense fog.</p>
<p>Now, I should mention the origin of my poetry writing.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, it's been four years. At that time, I suffered the same pain as Juyin; externally, we were plagued by poverty and illness, and internally, we were burdened by national and family sorrows. In short, we were mentally and physically exhausted, and I still can't bear to recall it. I lived in Xiangjiapo on the South Bank of Chongqing. On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, it was late. The moonlight poured down like silver, reflecting the scaly waves of the Yangtze River. I crossed the river to visit Juyin. How I longed to see my friend in distress! But Juyin was not in the theater troupe. He had gone out and did not return late at night. Who knew where his tears had flowed again?</p>
<p>I lonely raised my heavy head and looked at the pale moonlight. I groaned Lao Po's "Shui Diao Ge Tou." – "Not leaving has resentment, why always part?" For the first time, I shed tears that I hadn't shed in ten years. The wind, cold and sharp, pierced my heart. With the little money I had, I got myself very drunk. Although my eyes were a little blurred, my heart was very clear. Dragging my staggering steps, I returned to the South Bank. It was the last ferry. It was not too far from the riverbank to Xiangjiapo. But it took me three full hours. By the time I tried to put my weary body on the bed, the moon had already been torn apart by the western clouds. Extreme fatigue caused extreme pain. I tossed and turned, unable to fall asleep. I got up, turned on the light, and wrote a poem to comfort Juyin. – This was my first new poem.</p>
<p>I had never dared to try writing new poetry. But after this, I felt that no literary form could express my feelings at that time more appropriately or suitably than poetry.</p>
<p>Then, I wrote a total of more than a dozen short poems. I had several of them published in Wanqiu's "Qingguang." Later, I used the pseudonym Bai Ke and sent them to Brother Kejia and Mr. Bian Zhilin, who was far away in Kunming. Kejia didn't know it was me. He wrote several lines of comments on the back of the poems. He said that these poems were indeed something squeezed out of life, but they were too tragic; even the meaning, the tone, and even every word. Mr. Zhilin sincerely wanted me to cherish this basic inspiration. The praise from my friends gave me some confidence. I began to scribble some little things that could also be considered poems. Speaking of why the meaning, tone, and even every word are tragic; of course, the oppression of life is the main reason. I really don't want to explain any further. At this point, I ask Brother Kejia to especially forgive me. I have never told you that Bai Ke is another pen name of mine. Because I really didn't have the courage to shamelessly offer my own immature voice in front of a poet who had been writing poetry for fifteen years. I also deceived an old poet—he is a giant star in the Chinese literary world. I said that these little poems were written by my young friend, a young man who had just turned twenty, who was learning to write; asking him to correct them. He didn't correct them. He just pondered for a long time, smiled sadly, and said; "Too heavy! These are the feelings of middle-aged people, and only middle-aged people can understand them."</p>
<p>Thanks to a big fire, it burned away some of my clothes, and it also generously burned away my first dozen or so overly dark little poems.</p>
<p>In this era, tall buildings and people's lives are equally fragile. What's more, a dozen or so little poems have always been despised as pretentious moaning (?).</p>
<p>But they are the bitter juice squeezed out of my life; I exchanged them for my haggard face; their cremation has a flesh-and-blood connection with me. Although they are poems that are so insignificant as to be ridiculous. But, please forgive me, I am Chinese, I do not have Gogol's generosity.</p>
<p>I was silent for a year!</p>
<p>When in pain, I read the Songs of Chu. Qu Yuan should be the poet I admire the most. Stirred by so many emotions, I picked up the pen to write poetry for the second time. Most of them are preserved in this little collection. Almost every poem in it hides a story, a destiny. But I don't want to add any notes, like adding feet to a snake. If it is not clear enough, I can only blame my weak ability to express myself. What I should apologize for is that these poems may be, as Mr. Xu Chi said, too slow and lack gunpowder. They cannot reflect the times. Then let them be a summons to the souls of those who are possessed!</p>
<p>If someone blames my poems for not being written for the masses. Then I can only look back on my shameful life process with resentful eyes.</p>
<p>Wait! Wait for the "world fire" that Tolstoy spoke of to come! Let it burn away the melancholy of the century, the suffering of mankind. Then, the small knot in my soul will naturally turn into smoke and be sprayed into the sky by that huge and intense flame.</p>
<p>Look! The clouds and dense fog have all dispersed. The sun poked her blood-red face out from below the horizon. (1945 · Spring Night · Yu.)</p>
<p>(Postscript) This manuscript was found in the files. Remembering old friends, I feel deeply lost.</p>
<h3>Night Walk</h3>
<p>— Zhang Muyao</p>
<p>It was a late autumn evening.</p>
<p>Looking up, there were a few stars reflecting in tired little eyes. The fields were bald. The roots of the corn were tied together in bundles and laid down by the edge of the fields, looking like a group of sleeping animals from a distance. The wind was very slight, but piercing.</p>
<p>"Brother, how much further is it?"</p>
<p>I turned my head to look at Wenluo, a childish face already etched with a lot of dust, two thin lips like withered leaves wriggling.</p>
<p>"Soon."</p>
<p>This was the fifth time giving the same answer. He tightened his pace, constantly shrugging the small bundle hanging diagonally on his left shoulder, staring at me with suspicious eyes.</p>
<p>"Is it really soon?"</p>
<p>This time I didn't answer, bit my teeth hard, and swung my numb feet, protruding two steps away from Wenluo.</p>
<p>"Brother, shall we rest for a while?"</p>
<p>The voice was like the cry of a desperate man. I hesitated slightly—continuing to lift my painful feet after the blisters burst.</p>
<p>"Wenluo, bear with it a little longer, it's really almost there."</p>
<p>The yellow mud formed village road was churning under my feet, sand gritty in my eye sockets; teeth grinding, making a subtle rustling sound.</p>
<p>"Brother, do you have guokui (big pancake)?"</p>
<p>"No more. We'll have a good meal when we get to the county seat."</p>
<p>"Eat—?"</p>
<p>He jumped up and affectionately grabbed my right arm, I felt his hand trembling.</p>
<p>I raised a travel bag with my left hand, and he understood the meaning.</p>
<p>"You want to sell it?"</p>
<p>"Yeah—"</p>
<p>He suddenly loosened my arm and quietly wiped the corner of his eye with his sleeve.</p>
<p>In the distance, a cluster of bonfires was shining, like a lamp. A corner of a lonely thatched hut was reflected.</p>
<p>"Brother, don't sell it, you only have this one set, sell mine—the Director Chen you mentioned, if he wants it, that's good!"</p>
<p>I grabbed his cold hand, gently stroking it, feeling a pang in my heart, suppressing my voice and saying softly:</p>
<p>"Don't be childish, it's the same anyway; sell it and have a good meal, who cares about Director Chen!"</p>
<p>Walking, walking, the pace was a little heavy, the heart, as if grasped by something. The sound of footsteps startled an old crow on the tip of a pine tree.</p>
<p>"Brother, I'm a little scared. I remember the year I came home from Zhuanba, my sister fell asleep on my shoulder, the sky was also so dark, Mom called Changlin to bring a lantern to pick me up, and also brought a bag of Xianggao—"</p>
<p>"Don't mention the past." I shouted madly.</p>
<p>"Um—"</p>
<p>I secretly saw Wenluo raise his sleeve again to wipe the corner of his eye...</p>
<p>The wind was subtle, but piercing. Looking out, it was a blur of pitch black. At the end of the road, there were stars reflecting in tired little eyes.</p>
<p>Wenluo re-shifted the package to the right corner.</p>
<h3>Heart Sacrifice</h3>
<p>— Zi</p>
<p>Dedicated to Fengjia, who rests in peace in the northwestern cemetery</p>
<p>It is such a lonely and quiet night, a dark sky, sparsely dotted with a few stars, accompanied by a half-moon crescent, emitting a faint light, shining on the face of this frustrated person, making her heart even heavier and older. A gust of evening wind, blowing the long hair scattered on her shoulders, stirred up my thousands of strands of sorrow, and the past quietly returned to my side, and the pain began to devour my broken and fragmented heart again, and I fell back into the bitter memories.</p>
<p>I can't remember how I spent these three long years, I only feel like a burdened camel, carrying a heavy burden of thousands of pounds of sorrow, taking difficult steps, and spending these miserable days, all the way until now. I can't forget the farewell in this miserable wind and rain, but who knew that this heart-wrenching farewell would be our eternal farewell?</p>
<p>Because of the lack of economic strength, and in order to complete your aspirations, after several consultations, it was decided to sacrifice my studies to complete you. I remember we talked late into the night on the eve of our departure. We agreed to expect a joyful reunion under the principle of responding to all changes with constancy. The next morning, on a drizzly morning, you embarked on the journey, and I sent you to the riverbank. In order to comfort each other, we both held back our crystal-clear tears, but in the end, we tearfully bid farewell in voices full of care. Leaning on the riverbank, I watched you standing on the stern of the boat with blurred, teary eyes, waving again and again, until I couldn't see your shadow. When I got home, I couldn't help but collapse on the bed and cry. But when I thought of our agreement and the future reunion, I endured everything, entrusting thousands of bushels of parting emotions to the beautiful dreams of the future. But, who knew that you would never return? I couldn't bear the grievance and complained to you. Every time I could get more comfort from you. I remember you wrote to me: "...Lianyu, don't be too hard on yourself. I know that when we return victoriously, your gray dream will fade away." But now, victory has been so long, and the gray dream has turned black, but where is your return? You tell me!</p>
<p>Because you lacked care, you lost the ability to care. Due to pleurisy and then pulmonary disease, you were forever separated from the world. Who killed you! For fear of making me anxious, you didn't let me know you were sick. When you were laid to rest in the northwestern cemetery, I was still hoping for a joyful meeting. When I couldn't get a reply to many letters, I began to suspect. Finally, the bad news came and I fainted. I received a letter from your friend, who said: "I have kept this shocking news a secret until now. I dare not tell Fengjia's relatives and friends, because it is like a sharp blade that will shatter everyone's heart, but looking at your snow-like letters flying over, I really can't bear to deceive you anymore. I opened every one of your letters, and when I finished reading them with tears, I always sent them to Fengjia's grave and burned them in front of his tomb, as if forwarding them to you. When he was dying, although he opened his mouth wide, he couldn't say a word. Although he wanted a pen, his stiff hand couldn't write a word. When he died not far away, his eyes were still wide open. I know that in his heart, he couldn't let go of the lover from afar - you!" When I woke up and regained consciousness, I suspected that I had just had a nightmare. I didn't believe that a kind person like you would really die, but when I saw the shadow of your tomb and your last appearance in my hand, I couldn't help but burst into tears and fainted again.</p>
<p>Now, on this occasion when the green willows are forming shade, I imagine that the grass on your grave must be full of lush greenery. The dim moonlight shines on me, and also shines on a cemetery in the Northwest. Thinking of this lonely scene, I really want to fly over on wings, even if I can't see your welcoming smile, just kiss your grave. Because underneath it lies you, sleeping forever. In your deep netherworld, is your body healthy? Will you answer me? Because I want to ask you, why haven't you come back yet?</p>
<p>The endless stream of mourning, the endless sorrow, let thousands of strands of sorrow stay here, you are dead, but you will live forever in my heart, forever, forever.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 524</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"And also left very safely!" Shouyi said, then turned around and invited Hejian to walk out of the room.</p>
<p>"Left safely?" Hejian asked as he walked.</p>
<p>"That's right!" Shouyi seemed to be touring a museum, calm and composed, ready to admire, his mind very leisurely.</p>
<p>"..., did you mention Pingzi's matter?" Hejian did not forget the main purpose of this trip, and also believed that the colored lines left by those naughty people were as precise as the electrical signal codes he invented, and could transmit messages.</p>
<p>"Pingzi's matter?" Shouyi seemed to have thrown Pingzi's matter to Java a long time ago: "According to my guess, since the mischievous people came, they must not go back empty-handed. What do you think they came for? Isn't it for Pingzi? Now that they're gone, of course they took Pingzi away, - as long as she was trapped here..."</p>
<p>"This is your guess, or is it explained on the symbols?" Hejian followed Shouyi to the back door of the house, went up the stone steps, and stood on the small corridor, refusing to leave. This action was a very clear indication: if Shouyi was not sure, explaining that Pingzi had escaped, Hejian would probably go alone and chase after the group of bandits who had just escaped.</p>
<p>"These symbols only indicate that someone has been here, and point out the person's current whereabouts, direction." As Shouyi said this, he suddenly discovered that there were many lines on the door frame of the main house, which, although in a backlight, seemed to contain a phosphorescent component, faintly emitting various colors of light, and pointed them out to Hejian: "Look, these lines, the first one is pink, which is the designated color of the big naughty Huijun, the sharp tip pointing to the inside of the house, indicating that she wants to enter the house; the two irregular small circles at the end indicate that she knows that the imaginary Miss Pingzi and another hostage are definitely in the house..."</p>
<p>"Oh, does one color represent one person?" Hejian was attracted by these lines, temporarily putting down Pingzi's matter, seemingly studying the theory, and his spirit was calmer.</p>
<p>"That's right, each of us in Bain Ren Zhuang has a designated line color," Shouyi said, taking out a pink-like thing from his pocket: "This is my designated color," he said, drawing a large circle around those color lines, which was a bright yellow. (According to the regulations of Bain Ren Zhuang when designating these colors, the more obvious the color, the higher the ability.)</p>
<p>After Shouyi drew this circle, he pointed to the second pale purple line and said; "This is the symbol of that little mischievous person who went to the hotel to visit you, although the sharp tip also points to the inside of the house, but it uses dotted lines, indicating that she entered the house from another direction; the third line, this pale blue one, is the younger sister of the little mischievous person, Ziyu, but she followed the big mischievous person into the room in an orderly manner; the pale gray line below, although it is also the color of a very naughty character, the person is relatively the most gentle, with some of the habits of the young ladies in the Dream of the Red Chamber, named Shaohua, her older brother Shaoqiu, is one of the brains of Bain Ren Zhuang, her lines indicate security..."</p>
<p>Shouyi, like a university professor, was slowly explaining the colors and markings of the various naughty lines here, when he had just said this, he suddenly heard gunshots outside, a total of three two-shots, the first "bang bang" was from the due south, aimed at the main door of this house; the second was in the due west, and the third two-shots were in the due east. Shouyi listened, immediately reached out and drew out the twenty-shot gun from Hejian's waist, leaped down the steps, and fired four shots into the sky in the open space, "Bang, - bang bang bang -" This was the agreed safety signal.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Random Talks on Independent Mooring</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>Recently, there is a film in Shanghai, it's quite popular, the title is "Cleopatra" (Caesar and Cleopatra) it's said to be written by Shaw. A friend asked me to watch this film, I left less than fifteen minutes after entering.</p>
<p>I know very well that this is a play, and I can watch it with a "playing the field" attitude, but I don't like it from the bottom of my heart. I don't want to force myself too much.</p>
<p>Many people compliment Shaw as the sun of the world, I think if the sun is really like this, I would rather live in darkness forever.</p>
<p>This old show-off has been distorting history from beginning to end. Cleopatra in his writing has completely changed her appearance. I can't recognize who he wrote. At the same time, I also have no ability to understand Cleopatra's silence.</p>
<p>Of course, I have already anticipated that many "some experts" will criticize my ignorance.</p>
<p>Let's look at it from another angle!</p>
<p>Towards Caesar, and only towards Caesar, the dead demon king Mussolini had a truly religious reverence. He said: "Caesar's assassination is a misfortune for mankind." He also said: "I love Caesar, he is the greatest man of all time. People want to compare him to his friend Pompey (the famous Roman general and consul), but it's like comparing silk to coarse cloth. He foresaw the brilliance of the Iron Age. He is a unique man, with the will of a politician, the philosophy of a philosopher, the talent of a genius, and the human touch of a man. He is a philosopher at heart, and his eternal pursuit of everything has not alienated him from human feelings."</p>
<p>On another occasion, when he was talking about Caesar with a foreign friend, he glanced around, picked up a book on the table behind him, and read aloud the first few lines of Shakespeare's Caesar play in Italian. Then he slowly put the painting back and leaned on his elbow, as he needed the same pause in philosophical conversations as he did when giving speeches. He finally said: "However, it is incredible that Caesar would fall into a trap." He was asked if he meant the scene of Caesar's assassination, "Of course. Didn't he know everything about the conspirators? His death was probably because he didn't know what to do next, and he deliberately sought death."</p>
<p>This strange interpretation of Caesar, and his consistent love for Caesar, are the elements of Mussolini's contempt for the masses, a contempt he shared with Caesar.</p>
<p>"Good is bad, and bad is good." Great Bernard! Forgive me for not understanding your humorous prank.</p>
<h3>An Admonishment to the Nobel Laureates of Today</h3>
<p>— Robbie</p>
<p>Although the invention of dynamite made Nobel's career a success and brought him wealth, it also became his lifelong regret. Because it was later used in wars, causing countless lives to be lost, which he did not expect. Originally, dynamite was researched to facilitate mining, but once it was invented, it was used by arms dealers as the best product. As a scientist with a conscience, how could he not feel guilty? Therefore, when Nobel was about to bid farewell to the world, he wanted to transfer all his property to a fund to reward academics, and he also specifically proposed a sum to be awarded to people who made great contributions to world peace, in order to make up for his deep unease and pain.</p>
<p>Originally, science is innocent, and the purpose of science is to benefit mankind, but because it has helped or deepened the harm of war, it is still condemned by people as all evil today. Such as the "radioactive cloud" and germ warfare, which are more terrible than atomic bombs, recently invented by American scientists, have kept us trembling with anxiety for a long time. Reporters are exaggerating the amazing power of these two weapons, and at the same time pointing out that in germ warfare, there are already thirty-three kinds of bacteria that can have powerful effects. This makes us fear war and fear science.</p>
<p>If our scientists are only diligently researching how to harm mankind, we really have to mourn for the white hair in the laboratory, and also mourn for science. We hope that a scientist must have a scientist's conscience in addition to his profound knowledge. Nobel's lifelong guilt was only someone else's mistake, but if today's scientists directly serve the war, this is an even greater trauma to science.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the sake of human peace, we must loudly appeal, Mr. Nobel Laureates of today's world, please stop immediately!</p>
<h3>Loquats of Tangqi</h3>
<p>— Yuanzhang</p>
<p>In the orchards near paradise, the dense green branches are already laden with golden loquats, as well as heart-shaped peaches and crisp green plums. From Anpan Township in the western suburbs of Tangqi to Dinghe and Chaoshan Townships, the area was known as the "Thirty Li Fragrant Snow Sea" when the plum blossoms were in bloom. Now, including the lush loquat forests of Hongpan Township for ten li, this vast orchard truly deserves to be called the "Forty Li Flower and Fruit Market." Among the fruits, loquats have the highest yield, followed by plums, and peaches have the lowest yield. There are many varieties of loquats, which can be roughly divided into two types: red sand and white sand. The planting method is seedling propagation. Loquats that have not been grafted are called wild loquats. Only after grafting can they be named as a certain variety of loquat that has been transplanted. The lifespan of a loquat tree is at most about sixty years, and at least only twenty years. Furthermore, when the loquats are ripe, they are most afraid of strong sunlight, because the loquats will become stiff after being exposed, resulting in a great loss.</p>
<p>The taste of freshly picked loquats is so fresh and sweet that the loquat juice, known as "fresh from the tree," overflows when the skin is broken. This is incomparable to the taste of loquats that have been picked for some time. The Shanghai Maling Company has also established a branch factory in Tangqi to pack extremely fresh loquats into cans, using scientific methods to preserve this extremely delicious "fresh from the tree" flavor, and transport them to Beijing, Shanghai, and other domestic and foreign regions, so that ladies in distant places can also enjoy this famous fruit. People from nearby Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and other places also make special trips to this orchard to eat loquats. They immerse themselves in the loquat forest, peeling and eating as many loquats as they can. Those with good appetites can eat up to five jin. Even after eating their fill of loquats, they can still eat their usual amount of food at mealtime, because the loquat pulp is very soft and contains a lot of sugar, making it very easy to digest.</p>
<p>When we went to the countryside to eat loquats, the villagers naively told us stories about the Japanese eating loquats: The Japanese moored their motorboats on the bank of the loquat forest, came ashore and broke off the loquat branches, and left a few barrels of kerosene under the trees, hanging many towels and socks on the trees. Although the villagers were heartbroken that the loquat tree branches were broken and the trees would wither, they were also grateful for the more valuable items they left behind. However, the simple-minded villagers did not know that the things left behind by the Japanese were looted from the shops of ordinary people.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Famous Songs</h3>
<p>— Solveig's Song</p>
<p>This is an interlude written by the great Norwegian composer Grieg for Ibsen's famous five-act fantasy play "Peer Gynt." Grieg adapted the music he wrote for the play into two suites, which are the very famous "Peer Gynt Suites." Solveig's Song is included in the second suite and is a beautiful and moving soprano solo.</p>
<p>Solveig's Song is a song of spring. After the prodigal Peer Gynt (the protagonist) abandoned his wife Solveig and left, she still lived in a small house in the Norwegian forest, waiting for her husband to return with hope and longing. By this time, she was a middle-aged woman. As she sat spinning, she wished that her husband would return with the beautiful spring, and sang this exquisitely sad song. The melody is as follows:</p>
<p>Winter will not stay long, spring will leave, spring will leave;</p>
<p>Summer flowers will wither, autumn leaves will fade, autumn leaves will fade;</p>
<p>Though time is merciless, I believe you will come, I believe you will come.</p>
<p>I will always wait, day and night.</p>
<p>Every morning when I pray, I wish you peace, I wish you peace;</p>
<p>Every night when I pray, I wish you health, I wish you health;</p>
<p>When the darkness passes, light will always appear, light will always appear.</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly hope that you will return one day.</p>

<h3>Anji Policy of the Northern Wei Dynasty – Random Notes on History 2</h3>
<p>— Xiao Dai</p>
<p>Because traditional racial concepts are deeply rooted in everyone's minds, racial discrimination is inevitable. Therefore, historical conquests and massacres have continued as a political means. Turning the pages of Chinese history, most of the records are about the Han people conquering foreign races or foreign races invading the Han people.</p>
<p>The people suffer from wars, and the people are massacred; but the officials take this opportunity to disturb the people and arbitrarily plunder them. For this reason, racial hatred becomes more and more profound, and the distance between them becomes greater.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Northern Wei (Northern and Southern Dynasties) regime, Emperor Shizu saw that his officials were arbitrarily plundering and ravaging people, taking advantage of the power of their masters, and that deepening racial antagonism was not a solution. Therefore, he began to vigorously implement the Anji policy, shifting racial hatred to racial tolerance. He then began to implement two tasks: prohibiting officials from disturbing the people and encouraging cultivation.</p>
<p>In the fourth year of Emperor Shizu's Taiping Zhenjun (443 AD), on the day of Gengyin in June, the following edict was issued:</p>
<p>"I, as the Son of Heaven, care about the people and worry about all nations. I want the people to have enough food and clothing and to promote etiquette and cultivation. However, the officials and governors cannot help me promote kindness and virtue, and care for the people's hidden hardships, and even seize their property and inflict cruelty on them, which is not the way to govern. Now, I will restore the people's assets and taxes for three years, and the land rent will be as usual. The governors and others should carefully and diligently govern, encourage mulberry cultivation, and not arbitrarily collect taxes. The relevant departments should investigate and punish them, and not let them go unpunished."</p>
<p>Prohibiting officials from disturbing the people was a passive measure to implement the Anji policy. The active measure was to encourage agriculture and mulberry cultivation and increase production.</p>
<p>The specific measures to implement the encouragement of agriculture and mulberry cultivation were first to determine the household registration and then to divide the fields equally. Determining household registration allowed the government to easily manage the people's residence and determine their annual income; then, the fields were divided equally according to the determined household registration. After years of war, this could enable the people to live and work in peace and contentment, and to live together regardless of race, and the people would not generate hatred again.</p>
<p>After this, the emperors of the Northern Wei Dynasty gradually united with the Han people by appeasing them. For example, complex surnames were changed to single surnames, intermarriage between foreign races and Han people was encouraged, "the language of the Northern customs was not allowed in the court," and Han official systems were adopted, and Hu clothing was prohibited. Such policies not only eliminated hatred but also further united them.</p>
<p>In terms of the current situation, the Anji and assimilation policies of the Northern Wei Dynasty still have some aspects that we can adopt and implement.</p>

<h3>Abolition of Corporal Punishment</h3>
<p>— Sheng Bo</p>
<p>On May 26, the Soviet Union officially abolished the death penalty and stipulated that: from now on, all crimes punishable by death under current law will, in peacetime, be replaced by imprisonment in correctional labor camps for a term of 25 years. The news explained the significance of the abolition of the death penalty order with the reasoning that "the cause of peace is safe and worry-free." Labor News and Foreign Minister Vyshinsky said: This is a historic decree, an unprecedented victory for humanitarianism.</p>
<p>Indeed, the abolition of the death penalty is in line with humanitarianism. However, the abolition of the death penalty cannot be said to be an unprecedented creation of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>In Chinese history, there was also a period of abolishing corporal punishment. In the thirteenth year of Emperor Wen of the Han Dynasty, an edict was issued to abolish corporal punishment, which said: "I have heard that in the past, people would wear full dress and change their clothes as a punishment, but the people did not commit crimes. How great is this governance! Now there are three types of corporal punishment, but crimes do not stop. Where does the blame lie? Is it not because my virtue is thin and my teaching is unclear? I am very ashamed. If the teaching is not pure, the foolish people will be trapped. The Book of Songs says: 'A kind and amiable prince is the parent of the people.' Now, when people commit mistakes, punishment is applied before teaching. Some want to change their ways and do good, but the way to it is cut off. I pity them. Punishments such as cutting off limbs and carving the skin cause lifelong pain and cannot be relieved. How can this be called the intention of being the parents of the people? Therefore, I abolish corporal punishment and replace it with other punishments."</p>
<p>Emperor Wen of the Han Dynasty not only spoke of humanitarianism but also emphasized education; unfortunately, after a period of order and chaos, corporal punishment was restored. The Soviet Union's abolition of corporal punishment in peacetime is not the highest ideal of peace.</p>
<p>The highest ideal of mankind is no corporal punishment, no punishment, and even no war!</p>
<h3>Talking about Gandhi</h3>
<p>— Li Ping</p>
<p>After visiting Gandhi, Dr. Luo Jialun, the Chinese ambassador to India, told reporters: "He is great, very great. I can say nothing else." Indeed, the word "great" is worthy of Mahatma Gandhi.</p>
<p>Speaking of Gandhi, the following impression immediately comes to our minds: a thin and weak old man, wearing a kasaya-like robe, a spinning wheel, and a goat. This is all his property. And he used this meager capital, relying on a spirit of righteousness, to contend with the British Empire, which was known as the "Empire on which the Sun Never Sets." Without weapons and without violence, hundreds of millions of Indian people followed him, going to prison several times without changing his beliefs, and going on hunger strikes several times without dying. In the end, not only were all the Indian people inspired by his spirit, but also people all over the world were shocked by his perseverance. If there is such a thing as a "miracle" in the world, Indian independence is undoubtedly a "miracle"; if there is such a thing as "God" in the world, Gandhi is undoubtedly the incarnation of "God."</p>
<p>In a conversation with Ambassador Luo, there was a philosophical meaning. "Gandhi compared the turmoil of the Indian public to the flowing water of the Ganges. The mud and sand on the surface will eventually settle, and the water will eventually appear clear." (Central News Agency, New Delhi, 28th) After reading these words, we truly have "a special feeling in our hearts." China and India, two great ancient civilizations, have encountered the same fate for hundreds of years. The "Hindu-Muslim" dispute in India is similar to the domestic turmoil in our country. The Indian philosopher Gandhi has already pointed out that "the mud and sand of the Ganges will eventually settle, and the water will eventually appear clear." What about the mud and sand at the bottom of our Yellow River? We believe that there will also be a day when they will settle and clear.</p>
<h3>Hospitality</h3>

<h3>Chronicle of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Okay, thank you! Then let them go to Hechi first! Because one of them is a patient and needs to go to the hospital urgently." Old Zhu felt that it would be better for Lan to get proper treatment sooner than to have her travel long distances on a KMT military truck. To thank the driver for his kindness, he took out a Sheaffer fountain pen from his shirt pocket, which someone had given him not long ago. "Driver Wang, but I can't let you work for nothing. You may not be willing to take my money. Then, I'll give you this pen as a souvenir!"</p>
<p>The driver did not have high hopes. Besides, the pen was shiny and new, probably worth tens of thousands of yuan, so he happily accepted it.</p>
<p>"Then, please hurry up. We're leaving in another hour!" This grandson was definitely counting on the situation.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaonian touched his empty shirt pocket with a lost expression and immediately urged Lu and Zhang to leave quickly. His steps were so big that Lu Qian, who was limping, could hardly keep up, and Zhang Chang had to jump and run to barely keep a distance of two or three steps behind him.</p>
<p>"But, who will accompany Mrs. Hu?" He asked Old Zhu halfway.</p>
<p>"Of course, you! I can't leave the group and leave." He replied without thinking. "Xiao Zhang, would you please help me this time? Since the director of the hospital over there is your uncle, it would be most appropriate to have you go together!"</p>
<p>"Okay! Okay! Okay!" Zhang Chang kept answering. But he thought of another thing: "But, what about Feifei?"</p>
<p>This was a matter that needed to be considered. Until they walked into the small teahouse, Old Zhu had not made up his mind. He felt that only Lan could decide for herself.</p>
<p>Lan was still lying on the ground in the corner near the stove, with two or three kind female team members sitting beside her. Feifei was also quietly leaning on a female team member, her small eyes red, saying nothing, just stroking the bronze rabbit.</p>
<p>As soon as the three Old Zhu walked into the small teahouse, everyone immediately crowded around to inquire about the news of the car.</p>
