<h3>對日和會表決方式　美將與我進行商談　十一國會議曨暫停邀請</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿一日電〕自中國決定與蘇聯合作，堅持在十一國對日和平初步會議中應使用大國否決權後，美國擬發出請柬舉行十一國會議之意向，己吿打消。美國本擬在數日內發出請柬，然中國之地位在過去一週中已吿强硬化，故舉行中美商談以覓取此問題之若干協議一事，爲事實上所必需。</p>
<p>英·法·荷蘭·菲列濱及印度，均已表示願意舉行此十一國會議，以三分之二之多數通過決議爲表決方式，及禁止任何國使用否決權。</p>
<p>在中國之驚人之舉以前，英美決定，由於問題之緊急性，値得不理蘇聯，進行冒險雜行會議，同時希望蘇聯能在最後一分鐘幡然改計。此間與遠東局勢有密切接觸之觀察家，對中國之決定動機何在，意見分歧，莫衷一是。</p>
<p>一派意見以爲中國被魏德邁批評中央政府之文告所刺激，並對美國袖手不作經濟援助而公開批評中國政治之行為大起反感，故「學全部重量他向」，提醒美國在遠東委員會及其他協議中，中國對遠東之決定有舉足輕重之勢。</p>
<p>另一派意見以爲，巾國此次之行動，頗有與美國討價還價，以取得經濟援助之意向。此間最高級人士承認對中國究竟目的何在，尙欠確切之跡象。彼等指望在以後兩週中，藉與王外長及中國駐美大使顧維鈞博士會談之助，使局勢能吿澄淸。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿日電〕我外長王世杰昨應國際新聞社之請，發表聲明，闡明我國對日和會之態度。王氏稱：會議之決議，應採取大多數表決制，然須包括四强（中英美蘇）之一致表決，而非如美國所建議之僅採三分之二多數表決制。</p>
<h3>魏使報告暫不公布</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿一日電〕此間人士今日預測，魏德邁特使在中國與朝鮮實地調査六屋期之結果，不致立即公布。魏氏返京後曾向歡迎人員談稱，特使團報吿連同建議，現已擬製完成，即將遞交國務院審核，但對內容如何則抱械默。渠並笑謂，任何問題可詢諸本團發言人華生君。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿一日廣播：華府方面人士今日發表意見稱，美國極願援助中國，甚至超過以往援華之程度。但在國民政府若干不可取份子去職以及行政方面有所改革之前，美國之更進一步援助中國，極少成功之希望。魏德邁將軍曾鄭重指出此點，茍中國具有改革之誠意，則必能接受魏德邁聲明中所含之意義。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿一日電〕政府專員今日聲稱，外傳除非美國從速援助中國，國府或將被迫設法親近蘇聯之說，絕對不確。此種見解僅係一部份人士對於美國未能採取堅定對華政策逐漸不耐之結果。中國旣未改變其外交政策，且亦無意於此。目前最大問題，厥在美國未來援助附帶「監督」條件之性質如何。一般官員並不反對正常監督款項用途，但對外國監督觀念，在本能上無不表示愼慨。美國必須進一步了解中國人民此種心理。</p>
<h3>張院長視察鞍山　今離飛長春再轉華北</h3>
<p>〔本報潘陽廿一日電〕張院長廿一日最八時赴鞍山，親臨鞍山鋼鐵廠，由資委會謝樹英，邵逸一周引導，留潘各省市首長等多隨一往，專車九日過遼陽，曾停留十分鐘，張氏下車在月台接見該站一負責人，詢問交通電訊情形。十時許抵鋼鐵城，煙氣彌漫，開工部門較前大增，矗立之九座煉鋼爐，已修復四百噸者一座，十月初可開始煉鋼，餘在修砌焊釘中。煉鋼廠已有一爐開煉，軋鋼鑄造機器各廠全部開工，緊張繁忙，令人興奮。煉焦廠十七排煉焦爐，已有一排修復，煉焦整爐焦炭似入車箱澆水，成紅熱一片，焦副產品肥田粉柏汕等產量亦多。鋼鐵初軋廠，由張院長剪綵復工，五噸紅鍋錠一再軋　，切成大小鋼塊，機聲隆隆，動人心魄，張氏連祝員工成功。下午四時三刻返潘，旋由陳誠兼主任，外郃東北特派員陳延　及廿一日返潘陽之資委會副委長孫越畸陪同參觀資委機車車輛製造廠，旣畢，張院長復與孫越崎，謝樹英等商談東北工礦問題，八時出席各省市長招待會。張氏定廿二日飛長春，再轉華北視察。</p>
<p>〔本報長春廿一日電〕長市臨參會特電張羣院長，歡迎來長視察。</p>
<p>〔本報潘陽廿一日電〕張院長廿一日下午由鞍山返潘後稱，渠之感想有三；　欽佩日人建設，　惋惜拆遷破壊，　欣悅鍋　廠員工工作精神。</p>
<h3>宋子文氏主粵　穗港各界歡迎　罹卓英正準備交代</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州廿一日電〕自宋子文主粵消息發表後，此間各方反應頗爲良好，一致認爲宋氏對於華南經濟改革，金融穩定，僑資運用，實業建設等，必有週詳計劃。羅主席卓英爲準備交代事宜，曾召所屬負責人開座談會，罹氏宣讀蔣主席來電，略調，「擬請兄來京服務，粵省府主席派宋子文同志接充，省府人事一仍舊貫，無多更動，請轉知努力服務一等語。羅民對主席關懐部屬德意，深爲感動，旋調：本人一向抱定公務人員祗有在工作崗位努力，不宜存政治地盤思想，個人工作崗位更動，與省政整體無關。至於辦理交代應迅速確實，金錢公物尤不宜稍有苟且」云云。</p>
<p>〔中央社香港廿日合衆電〕廣州中國各報咸一致歡迎宋子文出主廣東。此等報紙指稱第一宋氏一向在廣東保有聲望，第二，宋氏係爲監視宜傳已久之廣東五年建設計劃之理想人物，第三，宋氏爲對外交涉之理想人物，蓋宋氏係海南島人，對華南之開發，甚感興趣，於一九三六年渠即曾與英國磋商協助開發華南事，但日本於一九三八年便入華南，致使宋氏之全盤計劃，付諸流水。然宋氏之某下屬，最近曾與英方恢復談判，匯豐銀行亦參與會談。</p>
<h3>納桑飛香港</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿一日電〕英民航部長納桑勛爵，廿一日　八時半，離京飛港返英。歸途中，將分訪曼谷，新加坡有等地，考察民航情况。</p>
<h3>第四批日艦　定廿五日抵靑繳呈</h3>
<p>〔中央社靑島廿一日電〕海軍方面悉，日本第四批繳呈　隻，已在抽　完畢，我方所獲十艘一，定廿五日駛抵賢，交海軍第二一基地司令部接收。</p>
<h3>邵力子談話　否認將出使蘇聯</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿一日電〕國民參政會秘書長邵力子今日聲稱：「外傳余將出任駐蘇大使，報界　予以如此重要職位，甚爲感謝，但本人並無所聞」。另據此問外交界人士稱，部氏過去具有使蘇經熟，此次駕輕就熟，再度任命，仍極可能。</p>
<h3>陳質平請僑胞　支持政府戡亂</h3>
<p>〔中央社馬尼剌廿日電〕此問我僑胞總商會及其他若干僑胞公會，因陳賀平公使赴京述職將來，特於昨晚設宴接風，陳公使即席作長篇演說，繼述過去一年內中菲之種種關係，同時籲請我僑胞繼續支持，及推廣與菲國社交界及政界友人之直接接　，卑吏中菲友好關係更得增强。渠幷謂一，祖國之政治情形，實能影　海外僑胞之地位，故渠強調稱：我僑胞實有支持戰亂及復興國家之責，而我政府亦有擊敗共黨之絕對自信，但所有國人，俱應服從領袖，盡力完成其愛國之職責。</p>
<h3>整飭東北軍風紀　陳誠表示正加緊進行中　朱懷冰應電邀日內飛瀋</h3>
<p>〔本報潘陽廿一日電〕陳兼主任誠表示，衆所關心整份東北軍風紀問題，正加緊進行。關於傷民之游擊部隊及無兵司令官等，亦將嚴加取締。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口廿一日電〕東北行轅陳兼主任頃電邀現任黃岡縣長中委朱懐冰氏往晤，朱氏定日內乘機飛潘。又中委胡庶華昨過漢轉湘。</p>
<h3>外匯使用情形調查後事　四監委由返京　就一般論尚滿意對外商絕無歧視　報告今開始商草擬</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕赴滬調査政府使用外匯情形及揚子·孚中等公司請領外匯情形之何漢文，杜光塤，王冠吾，谷鳳翔等四監委，在滬調査兩週，工作已吿段落。廿一日晟由滬返抵京，當日下午四時許連袂往謁于院長，報吿此行所得，並定廿二日長開會，共商草擬報吿書事。四監委此次赴滬，在各方協助下，工作順利，所獲殊多，蒐集卷宗有一大　之多。以各方對此案咸殊關切，擬於一週內即將報吿書擬就提出。</p>
<p>何監委等一行，係七日赴滬，留申期問工作殊忙碌，不必要酬酢咸謝絕，調査對象着重於外匯之申請，核准，限額分配及進口等項。先後曾赴與物資供應有關之中信局，物資供應局等機關調査，中央銀行輸出入委會等機關各種外匯材料，及發給許可證情形，亦曾加以調査，並爲明際實際情况計，又曾至海關·公和祥等碼頭察看。最後又曾至揚子·孚中·中建·嘉陵·南洋企業等有關公司調閱卷宗。其一部份賬目，由現仍留滬之審計部兩職員核對中。渠等下週亦可返京。</p>
<p>據前往調查之某監委談：此次赴滬調査印象最深者，爲政府過去管理外匯失之過鬆，確有浪費現象，聞政府原有外匯約八億美元，然至去歲十一月底已耗去三億餘美元，殊可惋惜，迨至最近，管制又失之過　，自上月十八日頒布自伽外匯輸入許可證暫停頒發後，不少物資積儲碼頭，無法提取。其中不乏必需品或生產原料，對於生產當有影響。彼等在滬時曾至某一碼頭參觀，因手續不合而無法進；之汽車，即達三百餘輛，若與其他各碼頭合併計算，其數當有五六百輛二據聞此類物資總値達一億美元。上海旣不能運入，似可能轉道香港走私人境，此對國家當爲另一損失。上海經濟界咸望對此能有合理解決。各監委對此亦將提出建議</p>
<p>各監委表示：對於當前外匯政策，除對上述現象將有建議外，一般而論，尙稱滿意。同時此次調査外匯，爲年來第三次調査，以前曾有建議者，此次將不再提出，即有所建議，亦將以新材料爲根據。中外商人對外匯政策嘖有煩言，然其中一部份實係彼等本身未依法織理必要手續，殊不能盡責負責大。至對外國商人使用外匯事，某監委以鄭重之語調稱：我國今日外匯政策，可謂絕無歧視外商情事。除政府機關外，若以單位個別而論，外商所請得外匯，其數　往往多於我國商界。惟我國外匯有限，當不能人人　皆滿意，此種情形，應予指出，以正國際視聽。關於揚子·孚中部門，將其整個調査合併報吿，而不單獨另擬報吿書。</p>
<h3>滬市參會及各大學校長　對魏使聲明意見　美總統表示關切　電駐滬總領代為轉達</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕自魏德進特使難華聲明發表後，本市聖約翰·滬江·之江·震旦·大同等八大學校校長曾於八月卅一日聯名致電美國杜魯門總統，馬歇爾國務卿等各當局，就敎育界立塲有所表示。至九月五日，又有市參議會·市商會·銀錢·紡織等十七工商團體領袖，會銜致電美當局，就本位立場，表示意見。現美國駐滬總領事戴維斯，先後接得美總統來電，囑將美政府對於收到各該電文後表示重視之童視，分別轉進八大學校及十七團體。茲譯錄美總領兩全文於下：「(銜略）」貴曾及其他十六團體聯合致常杜魯門總統暨美國其他官員之聲明，已於九月五日收到。鄙人茲受蔽國政府之命，特代表杜魯門總統暨其他官員向　端保證，對該聲明之中意見，深為注意輿論切，並已分別兩複其他簽署於該聲明上之十六團體矣。戴維斯，九月十九日一（分數八大學校校長函大意相同，茲從略）。</p>
<h3>禁牽涉過多　應謀合理解決</h3>
<p>〔又電〕何漢文等四監委此次赴滬，除調査外匯使用情况外，尙奉命調査六七專案，又聞彼等在滬時，對上海當前若干社會問題，亦加調査，將有建議案提出。據王寇吾委員談：上海目前最可法意之社會現象有下列數點：　貧富過於懸殊，奢侈者一擲億萬無吝色，而貧者所過之非人生活其苦有難以想象者。彼等對國家雖無怨言，然演變結果，足以影響社會安寗。　上海人口太密，空氣混濁，廣設法予以疏散。　蘇北·皖西·魯南等地難胞，　集滬濱，有數十萬之衆，足以刺激物價，應謀善策。　禁舞雖爲政府政令，然牽涉過多，決非短時期所能禁絕，應謀合理解決。</p>
<h3>太平輪抵厦　菲方遺回華人十七名</h3>
<p>〔本報福州廿一日電〕菲政府昨電廈市府稱，今可自菲抵廈之太平輪，本華僑十七名被遣回其中十五名為輪渡赴菲者，餘二爲共匪。</p>
<h3>聯總署長魯克斯　定下月十日抵滬</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕聯總總署署長魯克斯將軍，定於下月十日抵滬。對於聊總在華之工作、將有所檢討及指示。</p>
<h3>新疆事件不致擴大　人民均渴望和平　府委鮑雨漢首度蒞京談</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕府委鮑爾漢廿一日下午四時飛抵京，新省建設廳長伊敝同來。前往迎候者有張治中，兪大維等多人。飽氏精神飽滿愉快，下機後曾器兪大維稱「十年未見」，旋即登車至寓邸。鮑氏此來係爲就任府委，記者曾詢以何以違違來京就職，渠稱：「自余被任命爲國府委員後，即準備來京，後因病請假三月，直至今日始克成行」。鮑氏定廿二“晟謁蔣主席報吿新省政情，並就所見對政府有所建議。二十二晚張治中在寓邸設宴爲其接風，並介紹與府委及政府首要見面。鮑氏爲塔塔爾族人，此行尙係首次來京。</p>
<p>記者以新疆事件之近開如何，詢諸鮑爾漢，渠稱「本人意見與張主任治中相若。本人認爲如能和平解決，決無問題。至伊寗方面對張主任之答覆，則因伊寗各負責人業赴天山避暑之故。現一伊寗與迪化間交通正常，深信事件不志惡化，如彼等返伊，決有續作商談之可能。新省人士仍極願和平，欲求邊疆安定，須使新疆永遠成爲中國領土」。另據鮑氏隨從吿記者，鮑氏早年留學德國，與兪大維同學，能識德·俄·華三種文字，前曾將三民主義由漢文爲維文，介紹三民主義之眞義於新省人民，現正著一「俄文·維文·漢文」三種文字互譯之辭典，即將完成，擬在京發行。此足爲開拓維漢文化交流之一大助力。鮑氏表示在渠等蒞京寓之一刻鐘後，即覺環境優美，極適合寫作。鮑氏旋介紹其同來之雄廳長伊敏，伊氏不能操國語，經予翻譯。渠吿以此行目的，爲解決新省人民生活，因新省乃一經濟落後之邊疆，現着手建議，自以水利·農牧·工業·交通爲始，去年度曾擬有五年計劃，唯目前尙未能全部完成，其原因有二：　經濟困難，　人才缺乏。以前者言，國府已撥款五十億新幣（合法幣二百五十億），茲已決定以共中二十億爲發展農牧，十億創辦鐵工廠，餘二十億則爲購買機器及羅致人才。</p>
<h3>新疆省鐵工廠　兩月後可完成　新建廳長伊敏稱</h3>
<p>鐵工廠預定在兩月後可建築完成，以後可日出鐵十噸。關於人才問題，國府已核定可派各種人才赴新。建廠長伊敏此次來京即爲邀約技術人員前往。建設方面需三十人，衛生處十二人。最後，伊氏希望明年度國府所給予之經費，再予增加。</p>
<h3>言論自由放寬限度　出版法將予修正　草案已凝定呈政院核示</h3>
<p>「本報南京廿一日電」憲政開始有期，言論自由限度將再放寬。現行之出版法係民廿六年七月所修正，與日前政治環境諸多不合，有關常局決予修正。內政，司法行政，外交，宣傳等部曾就此事迭次會商，擬定修正出版法草案，呈請政院核示，即將提出政院會議討論。據悉，修正出版法草案之若干主要規定，與現行出版法出人甚大，其重要者約如下述：</p>

<h3>為世界大局呼籲！</h3>
<p>聯合國第二次大會在紐約成功湖開幕，未及一週，美蘇兩國代表先後演說，針鋒相對，不僅使成功湖上波瀾迭起，而且世界行將分化爲兩大集團的越勢，因此更加明朗向以溝通英美與蘇聯兩大集團爲己任的法國外長皮杜爾，對於聯合國機構的成功，也在表示絕望。他說：「美蘇兩國間之衝突，日益尖銳化，情形甚爲嚴重；促使雙方妥協，似已不可能。」單從皮杜爾外長此寥廖數語看來，也就可以明瞭目下世界大局，幾乎到了山雨欲來風滿樓的景象。我們曾經飽嘗兩次世界大戰慘禍的人，應急起而爲世界大局向大政治家呼籲了。</p>
<p>在聯合國第二次大會開幕之前，世人早料到前途的艱難，以爲美蘇的外交戰，或將不得不在會塲中「攤牌」。治聯合國大會開幕之後，美國國務鄉馬歇爾元帥爲爭取聯合國的成功起見，首先發動外交攻勢，在聯合國大會席上發表演說，除了主張嚴格限制否決權的行使而外，並正式向大會建議設立五十五國常務委員會，經常開會，專事硏究關於和平與安全的問題。同時他又指出目前有七項軍大問題亟待解決：　否決權問題；　增加聯大權力問題；　朝鮮問題；　希臘內戰問題；　原子能問題；　裁軍問題；　巴勒斯坦問題。馬歇爾國務卿的連次演說，不啻承認安全理事會的失敗，而且也是美國對蘇外交戰的第一砲。</p>
<p>蘇聯代表維辛斯　機即在十八日於聯合國大會席上發表演說。措詞的銳利，遠非我們意料所及，幾乎國際禮貌外交辭令，完全置之腦後。他直率指出馬歇爾國務卿的建議，述背聯合國憲軍的規定，綜合其演辭之要點，有下列各項：　英美企　在聯合國機構之外，罔願聯合國之利害，行施其政治措施，此項政策足以威脅聯合國機構之存在；　在聯合國機構所有活動中最爲失敗者，厥爲裁軍問題的延宕不決，而英美初無裁軍之意，應負其責；　杜魯門主義與馬歇兩援歐計劃，均與聯合國的原則相遠背，美國對於他國企岡採取獨裁政策；　英美企圖利用德國的重工業，尤欲使魯爾區成爲美國在歐洲之經濟根據地；　聯合國對於英軍駐在希臘與外約但，美軍留駐中國境內，阿根廷不遵守聯合國對西班牙問題所通過之決議。以及南非洲對於西南菲洲未提出託管協定，均應有所行動；　印度尼西亞事件只能稱之爲侵略行動；　伊朗間題不應列入安全理事會議程內；　對於希臘北陲鄰國之指摘，均無事實根據；　馬歇爾將朝鮮問題提交聯合國大會討論，實違背莫斯科三國外長曾議對於朝鮮問題所發表之宣言；　反對馬歇爾提議設立五十五國常務委員會，指其目的乃在規避安全理事會。維辛斯基外次在演說中，甚至毫不客氣，以「戰爭販子」的帽子，戴在美國若干政治家的頭上，自然更要引起美國朝野的反感。誠如衆議院外交委員會主席伊登所說：「美國與蘇聯最後一拼，實無可避免者。今日的世界，在兩種互相排斥及不可妥協的人生哲學中，必須早日有所抉擇。蘇聯之公開目標，乃在以武力征服全世界，是以美國應該不惜任何代價，保持其在聯合國中所處之領導地位與責任。」</p>
<p>由此可知美蘇雙方各趨極端，確已瀕於破裂的邉緣。這次會議的結果，似有使美蘇分道揚鑣的可能。我們不論爲自己的利益打算，或是爲整個世界的利益打算，終覺得戰後的世界，還是宜合而不宜分，美蘇兩國更宜妥協而不宜破裂。造成今日美蘇兩國相持不下的因素，固然不一而足，但是最重要的，乃在戰後國際政治外交家，往往易爲本身的利害觀念所蒙蔽，而不能運用其政治智慧，超脫狹隘的國家觀念及自私心理，而極權思想與强權主義還在作祟。外長會議也好，或者舉行聯合國大會也好，列强依然同床共夢，不僅不能解決任何問題，反而使國際間的裂痕更加深刻。所以爲今之計，首在消除列强間的猜忌，如果各國代表都能言忠信，行篤敬，彼此推誠相見，互讓爲懷，大家以世界和平爲重，則聯合國就不會怕失敗，否決權的存廢根本也不會成什麽大問題。要之，時至今日，世界已到了分合的階段，聯合國機構也已到了成敗的關頭，但願各國的政治家，在討論當前的國際問題時，都能訴諸人類的良知。我們相佰人類固有的良知，必能克服當前國際問的任何隔閡與障礙。</p>
<h3>郵政得新措施</h3>
<p>在行政效率普遍低落今日，我們看到中國郵政業務的日新月異，格外覺得難能可貴。我國郵政向來採取「以郵羲郵」的政策，在抗戰之前，物價穩定，尙能自給自足；但至抗戰期間，物價高漲，而郵資增加，落在物價之後，最近政府對於國營事業，又停止貼補，郵政經濟的困靴，是不難想像得之的。但是郵政經濟儘管困難，革新措施却仍層出不窮　，贊在值得稱許。</p>
<p>郵政總局畫夜辦公，各處分局也無例假，離開郵局較遠的市民，若謙往來不便，則有流郵動局按時駛過，只要在路旁守候，就可以寄信或匯款。在投遞方面，自實行分區編號的辦法以來，更見迅速，同時又發動消滅「死信」連動。所以今日上海的郵政，確實堪稱得上「穩」「廉」「快」三字了。</p>
<p>郵政上這種不可多得的成就，不僅爲與論所稱道，而且也爲人民所攥護。事實是最好的宣傳，原無需我們再有所費辭。但是最近因爲中秋佳節的將屆，郵政當局爲移風易俗起見，又特下令禁止郵差討索「節省」，並應當獎勵人民檢舉，這種贊明措施，更使得我們的贊助。</p>
<p>郵政當局不僅竭智盡能改進業務，使郵政完全爲人民服務，而且欲進而變換社會的風氣，其意義格外重大。但願市民共同協助，並盼望其他公用事業也聞風響應。</p>

<h3>聯大即將討惀聖地問題　英內閣商定對策　該地委治權你予以放棄　但對聯合國新建議仍願加以考慮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿一日廣播：英國駐巴勒斯坦之軍隊，究將撤退與否，或減少至若何程度，須待聯合國大會討論巴勒斯坦問題之結果如何，始能有所決定。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿一日廣播：美國衆長馬丁今日發表意見構：聯合國大多數國家對巴勒斯坦問題意見之一致，可使此世界上最困難題之一，早日獲得解決。余希望此項解決辦法不久即能商隊。因該項問題　已躭擱過久，致使同　西族均受重大痛苦云。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二十日電〕英國業已決定除非聯合國機構不久能提出可以施行的巴勒計劃，英國將交出聖地之委治擱，並撤退其駐在該處之軍隊。可靠方面相信，英內閣之特別會議雖已決定撇兵之原則，然聯合國機構所將提出之任何新的建議，仍將由英政府予以考慮。今日之內閣特別會議，係第一次就聯合國特委會之巴勒斯坦建議案，由內閣全體予以討論。艾總禮首相召集此會，具有兩重意義：一為獲取閣員對聯合國特委會之多數及少數建議案之反對；一為決定出席聯大英代表團於下週辯論巴勒斯坦問題時應行採取之立場。殖民大臣理斯特自牙買加之西印度會議趕回倫敦參加，渠即將前往紐約，親自向聯大陳述英國對於巴勒斯坦問題之意見。據悉，今日英閣特別會議之主要討論事項，有下列數端：　承認聯合國機構在現階段中，似不致得有可使英國單獨或在他國協助下施行的巴勒斯坦解決方案；　承認英軍十萬名之　續駐在聖地，與英國之裁軍以補充經濟復興工業所需人力原則相悖；　英軍雖駐在聖地地，而該地局勢仍繼續惡化，故已不克使該處於危險狀態之中。</p>

<p>據稱，此種演說，肆意指責，絕對誣蔑美國之動機，毀謗個人與團體，使堅信蘇聯和平意向之多數美國人爲之企餒。此種演說對於蘇聯人民或能收效，使若輩驚駭，而相信美國有意用武力攻擊蘇聯。但在美國則相反，美國朝野堅守聯合國之原則與政策，不管外來之挑撥。吾人不信維辛斯基君有意損傷吾國之榮譽。美國仍相信和平乃全體國家朝野一致之目標。吾人相信追隨蘇聯者心術不正，易於傾向憎恨與戰爭，不易發生親愛與和平。反之，吾人已保證全力爲聯合國後盾，希望子子孫孫免戰爭之塗炭，誠以聯合國機構乃和平之工具故也。</p>

<h3>滬全體職業舞女　上書蔣夫人呼籲　對禁舞問題希望重作考慮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自中央禁舞命令到達本市後，舞業職工益感恐慌，聞舞業職工會方面已決定於二十三日上午在新仙林再度召開大會，會後向市參議會請願，俾請求參會在討論此項提案時，附帶考慮本市特殊環境，而將限期酌予延長。再本市舞女因感禁舞限期，已迫眉睫，昨特發動全體簽名，上書蔣夫人。茲探錄全文如後：</p>
<p>「蔣夫人鈞鑒：此次政府爲厲行簡約，決定禁舞，我等弱女子，雖以伴舞爲職，知識淺陋，但亦頗知自愛愛國，決當摒絕奢靡，力行節約，惟爲掙扎飢餓，苟延蟻命，對於禁止營業性跳舞一點，敢掬赤誠，敬尙夫人作將伯之呼。按營業性跳舞，本身並不奢靡；視爲奢糜者，乃藉舞塲之便，兼營其他奢侈品販，　奢侈性附業而已。如總爲節約，只須廢除上述之奢侈品販賣，或奢侈性附業，已足達到目的；况全體舞塲，爲配合當局之節約工作，亦已自動停售各色洋酒與高貴飲品，而祗以淸茶　樂，供人消遣，既無反節約之處，自無禁絕必要。猶之菜館與汽車，只以限制奢侈名菜，或限用過　汽油爲節約對象，並未根本禁絕菜館營業，或禁止汽車使用，性質雖異，而意義相同。况我等僅舞女一職，已有五千餘人，其他直接間接賴此爲生者，何止十數萬人，一旦生計斷絕，形成何等慘象，不言可知。即我等職業舞女中，分析家世，或幼失怙恃，孤苦伶仃，或文君新寡，黃口嗷哺，或父母殘廢，不事生產，或家長失業，生計無依，身世雖異，辛酸味同，莫不以伴舞收入，爲養家活口之計，誰無父母，　忘廉恥，誰　女兒，甘作　抱生涯，孰忍以不潔白身心，為眾人輕視，然為生活鞭策不得不强顏歡笑，以掩內心之痛，而博活命之資，每念身世之悽凉，與際遇之悲慘，未嘗不掩面飲泣，更有何心追求豪華，醉生奢糜，職業舞女之家　既重，固無待政府之督促，隨時隨地變在力求節約，縱有少數忘本之流，決不能目爲全體皆然，苟政府當道，但見跳舞爲奢糜，不察舞女生活之辛酸，驟然禁絕，豈僅我等弱女子之生計斷絕，更有大多數慫業人員，無以為生，蓋急切之間，既無轉業機會又無轉業能力，悲慘命運之結局，勢將流爲社會之　，爲害之大，亦必十百倍於跳舞，此則決非當局爲簡約而禁舞之目的。用敢泣血上陳，敬懇夫人體上帝好生之德，憐弱女子等垂危之命，轉向政府當局，作有國建議，對禁舞問題，重作考慮不使　萬生　，立絕活路，臨肅惶悚，不勝迫切待命之至　專肅恭叩鈞安。上海全體聯業舞女叩。」</p>
<h3>請吃官價月餅</h3>
<p>中秋轉瞬即屆，食品店競製月餅應市，慨格昂貴，令人咋舌。據悉市府爲配合節約消費運動，認爲月餅既　消費品，自應有所限制，現正草擬辦法，對中秋月餅售價，將作硬性規定云。</p>

<h3>繼李澤之後　新新公司代理總經理　蕭宗俊被控資敵嫌疑　投資建造船隻售予敵軍應用</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕新新公司總經理李澤被控漢奸嫌疑案，尙在高院更審中，詎料一波未平，一波又起。該公司代理總經理蕭宗俊，又被人向司法機關控吿通敵資敵，日前曾票傳偵訊，蕭稱病未到庭，由律師具狀　請延期。據聞該案內容頗爲複雜，控吿之大意如下：蕭係廣東人，現年四十二歲，爲經濟漢奸沈長　之妹壻，在上海淪陷期間，蕭與堂兄蕭錫　利用隆昌船廠，興仁企業公司，興仁地產公司，中華實業銀行等機構之雄偉資力，更藉其妻兄沘長賡之經濟力量，投資建造船隻售給敵軍，以供敵人運輸軍用物資之用，先後資敵輪船有二十餘艘，其中一艘且　蕭私人獨資所建，售與僞安徽省政府，專供偽府與敵軍連絡部所合組之遝輸機構所用。</p>
<p>當時適値羅逆君强，林逆柏生一交替時期，以致一部船價未能淸結，蕭一再請託葉雪松，蔡美舜　，李維　等交涉收取，此種經過一，凡羅·林兩逆任內　員，以及隆昌·興仁等公司內高級職負，均所共知，稍加偵訊，立可證實一。同時更有隆昌·興仁及蕭本人一賬册　各該公司之銀行錢莊往來支票，可以澈究。又在敵偽時期，蕭與敵軍特務機關重要份子蔡一誠仁，勾結敵酋吉野少將，蕭潛一赴港粵時，曾携大量名貴西藥，一　媚敵酋，返滬後復受命採辦大批食糧及軍用物品運往廣州資敵一，廣州方面經理此事者係沙基梁球記，一經飭查，與相立明云云。司法機關以該案情節相當重大，頗爲注意，對此將縝密偵査，預料日內將有驚人發展。</p>
<h3>浦東新裝發電機　發電量增二千瓩</h3>
<p>浦東電氣公司新裝移動式發電機一座，夜間可發電二千三百瓩，白天亦可發電二千瓩，因一部冷却設備尙待改進，致未達最高效率。該機於日前該公司復業二週年紀念日，正式發電，公用局局長趙曾珏，被邀前往參觀，即席對全體員工致詞，並稱：本市各發電公司，均因區城關係，現皆各自為政，惟電源供應，本市必須有一整個計劃，統籌支配，一極盼該公司爲寬行此一計劃，共同參加聯合電氣公司組織。</p>
<h3>車夫慘斃輪下　吉普肇禍逃逸　根據漆痕查獲　羅馬尼亞籍司機就逮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨晨零時二十五分左右，有三輪軍夫王中興，（阜寗人，二十五歲）踏車駛過威海衛路同孚路一三四號門口時，突被美軍吉普車猛撞，車毀人死，當時肈禍之美軍開足速率，畏罪逃逸無踪。事後新成警分局據報，經丁股長亟飭股員顧啓　翁、水泉等率　四出緝査，結果在三輪車後之紅漆上檢騐得有破裂痕跡，即根據此點，派　員　夜至跑馬應，江灣，百老匯大廈等數處調査，卒於三時　在跑馬應美軍抗日英　保管處內，査獲肇禍之吉普卡（照會爲國滬一四　五六號）。騐得其前面保險梗染有紅漆，並査悉司機係羅馬尼亞人，名喬治。嗣在林森中路三三九弄二號將其捕獲，帶局偵訊。至輾死之三輪車夫屍體，經　送常德路騐屍所候報地檢處派員檢騐。</p>
<h3>油幫輸送迅速</h3>
<p>油輪構造與普通輸船不同之點，即油艙爲若干隔艙所組成，油品裝卸，悉用油帮輸送，極爲迅速安全。因船艙係多數隔艙所組成之關係，航行設有遇險，在普通狀况下，船體終可保持浮力，不致沉沒。</p>
<p>至油輪主要之救火設備，各油艙及邊艙均有蒸汽管連通至鍋爐艙，遇有火警，即將蒸汽放入各火警油艙，以排除艙內空氣，藉以减少空氣中之氧氣，撲滅火警。此外尙有救火水管及泡沫滅火　裝置艙面及必要處所，以防止艙面各處之火災。</p>
<h3>開辟遠洋航線</h3>
<p>據該公司負責人談：中國油輪公司於本年二月成立後，即從事油輪之接收，惟接收之油輪多數均待修理，尤以甲級汕輪破損最甚，當經一而積極修理，同時開始運用。乙級汕輪十六艘早已修妥，航行內河及沿海一帶。此次甲級永洪輪修竣後，即將開闢遠洋航錢，航行伊朗裝運原油，如首次試航成功，則其餘甲級船三艘，亦即繼續遠洋航行，以期增加原油之輸入。綜計二月至七月該公司受中國石油公司及外商亞細亞·美孚·德士古等三公司之委託，自上海。台灣運往南京·漢口·靑烏）天津等地之汽油·火油·柴油　燃料油共九萬四千餘噸。</p>

<p>礦工深山得石</p>
<p>稱「該地有一寺人，在</p>
<p>東港作礦工，十三年前在深山礦塲內搬運一互石時，忽發覺石內咯咯作響。嗣將其開後，即發現此一形如　卵之晶瑩石塊，外包有粗糙之薄膜一層。該土人爲好奇心所使，擬用斧將石塊劈開。詎料石質堅硬，僅砍落一小塊，（本報十六日所　照片，即係正面缺口處）。嗣因無法擊碎，即存放家中。</p>
<p>七面荷盾購得</p>
<p>後因余與土人相處甚久，偶後渠等口中探知此事，結果幾經討價還價，始以七百荷盾購得。迨至民國卅四年九月爲日寇誣以政治嫌疑犯，拘押於巨港集中營中，至翌年十月間始獲釋放。惟被捕前余早將該石塊及其他重要物裝於一香烟罐中，埋於住處附近之樹下，釋出後即重至該地挖出，攜赴新加坡。卅五年返滬，在京·滬兩地各勾留一星期，嗣即赴台任職一。</p>
<p>寄赴美國研究</p>
<p>李君　稱：在京滬時確曾托友各處設法檢騐，並曾有友將碎石寄赴美國研究，憔迄未有正式答覆。有謂係寳石，亦有稱係石英，然亦有人認爲確係鑽石者。來台後曾將前被土人擊碎之一塊交予合大敎授某博士，請其檢定，業已一月余，尚無確實　　。</p>
<h3>夜間發射　淡綠光芒</h3>
<p>本報記者復詢以該鑽石之詳情，據李夫人（甬人）稱，該石全部透明，放置手中稍一側動，則有甚强之反射光，置於水中，一若無物然。在夜間黑暗處，則發淡綠色光芒。用之　厚玻璃杯，　然即裂。報載重釣四百克拉，據答並未以計算克拉之機械量過，僅以中國市秤衡之共重四兩五錢云。</p>

<h3>從鄧漢祥透視川政</h3>
<p>〔本械重慶十六日航訊〕四川省有個了不起的大人物，他就是鄧漢祥。從劉甫澄將軍主持川政起，一直到鄧錫侯將軍眞除川省主席爲止，足足有十二個年頭，省府秘書長一職，前後幾乎給他一個人當完了。</p>
<p>一個貴州人能够在四川如此的煊赫，確不是件易事，他早年畢業保定講武堂，是個道地的軍事人材，背起他的經歷來，僅祗是担任過段祺瑞將軍的秘書長這一個官銜，就够把後生小子嚇壊了。段麒瑞將軍下台，他息影北平，恰巧劉甫澄將軍派了位代表　祖佑到那裏。在北方人看來，四川人與貴州人，就等於大同鄉。鄧漢祥會盡地主之誼，慇懃的招待　祖佑一番。</p>
<h3>四川省政府秘書</h3>
<p>鄧漢祥近影　（特派員歐陽醇寄）</p>
<p>當嵇祖佑回到成都後，劉甫澄將軍問他的北行觀感時，他就力向劉將軍推薦：「鄧鳴階是個大人材」。及至劉將軍將鄧漢祥接往成都遊歷，要把幾個稅捐肥缺送給鄧幹，作爲酬勞，他都婉轉謝辭，劉甫澄將軍就感覺到「這位鄧先生確是淸廉之士」了。後來，不由鄧漢祥考慮，便發表他爲省府秘書長，自己則專心應付軍事上的事宜。今天，劉甫澄將軍雖已故世將近八年，他的</p>
<p>軍事力量</p>
<p>仍然不可輕視，這不得不歸功於這位做過好幾任秘書長的鄧漢祥，他沒使劉將軍在政治上操心。他替四川政局佈置了一道堅强的陣容。</p>
<p>民國廿五年，他在成都主持四川省縣政人員訓練班和各種幹部訓練班。（包括：財訓，社訓，師訓，水訓，禁訓及保甲幹部訓練班）縣幹班共辦了三期，畢業了一千零二十多個學員。現在四川大多數的縣長，科，秘，局，處長及少數的專員，要喊鄧漢祥爲「老師」就是這個原因。但是，値得驚奇的，是分散在全川的九百多位</p>
<p>縣訓學員</p>
<p>（已死去幾十位），到目今還沒有個顯明的組織。至於各幹班的社會關係更複雜了，參加受訓的計有一萬多人。各幹班曾經有個「各幹班畢業生調査處」的組織，在劉甫澄將軍，王纘緖將軍，賀國光將軍主持川政期間，都有過津貼。這情景一直維持到張岳軍將軍兼代川省主席時才取消。</p>
<p>鄧漢祥先生身長，健壯，雙目有神，一年四季愛穿中服。他沉靜，不動聲色，今年六十一歲。據說平生就是「不記人仇」，而一生活在一個複雜的政治漩渦中要「不記人仇」，確需高人一等的一本領。劉甫澄將軍逝世，王纘緒一將軍代理主席，他的秘書長職務一，依然未曾動搖。待王將軍眞除一主席的命今在日報上發表，一件</p>
<p>意外事情</p>
<p>竟然發生。足智多謀的鄧漢祥與王將軍，令人不可揣測的起了一塲衝突。他氣憤的從成都來到了重慶，張岳軍將軍正担任重慶行轅主任，邀請他爲行轅第二廳廳長。</p>
<p>他在重慶沒有委屈多久，二十九年中間，有一天，城區每一條街道上添加了軍警，而郊外的實彈士兵，從四郊各縣又意圖湧進城內，形勢緊急萬分，鄧漢祥飛回了成都。結果，王繼緒將軍請纓出川殺敵，蔣委員長以一國元首之尊，兼理四川主席。可是，一直到張岳軍將軍以委員長成都行轅主任的資格兼代川政，鄧漢祥才</p>
<p>重新跨進</p>
<p>了省政府的大門。從財政廳長，兼四川省銀行總經理再兼四川省田賦管理處處長的一述串官銜，一直到今天的秘書長。多少人跌倒了，他還兀立著不動。</p>
<p>誰如果關心和推測四川政情，第一個不能放慫的人物，就是他：鄧漢祥。〔特派員歐陽醇）</p>

<h3>制造植物病蟲藥劑　成都化學家　從實習員升任　平民化廠長</h3>
<p>〔本報成都十八日航訊〕四川省農業改進所植物病蟲藥劑示範廠廠長周德龍氏是位年輕的化學工作者。他二十六年從武漢大學化學系畢業後即來蓉任該廠實習員，一直經過技工，股長的階段昇任爲今日的廠長。成都的新開界人員曾到該廠參觀，稱譽他爲「平民化的廠長」。他不像一般行政負責者專辦「等因奉此」的形式公文，任何人士訪問他，總發現他在實騐室中努力工作；而由他滿臉鬍髭和破洞的工作長褲中，常會使初見面的懐疑他是否爲廠長。藥劑廠計共成立八年，創辦時業務推進頗感困難，省府曾無代價將各項減蟲藥品向各鄉村散發，待農民相信藥品成效，自動購買，則略收成本價格，尤以出菸區域，如什祁·金堂　南溪　宜賓　等地，每年均派有專員前來購置殺菌藥劑。周廠長對記者談稱：該廠已間接增加了農村的生產。局氏正着手撰寫一有關農業化學的書籍，以他十年來實際工作的經騐，可以預料這是本有價値的科學讀本。（醇）</p>

<h3>紡聯會續開會員大會　各區公會報告會務</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕約聯會二屆會員大會，昨晨十時，於市商會續開，劉靖基主席，由紡聯會代表及各區公會作詳盡之會務報吿。首先由吳昧經代表報吿紡聯會二年來之會務，謂該會當時成立之動機，爲　計劃接收日本紗廠，　計劃勝利後日本紗廠設備之拆遷，　計劃接收戰前　日貨市塲，　配合政府工業五年建設計劃。成立後完成之工作，爲　與歲林部合作，於勝利後將棉花　子送至鄭州。　調査全國棉產。　後方紗廠及全國紗廠之調査統計，後一工作尙待完成。　成立各區之紡織業公會。　籌設獨立之棉業基全。　購置紡聯會　址於地　路靜安寺路。　國大名額立委額額問題尙待解決。</p>
<p>繼由各區棉紡業公會代表報吿會務。首先由二區代表石鳳翔，報吿陝西各廠在戰時之艱苦情形。</p>
<p>三區代表駱仰止，報吿昆明區紗業情形，謂地方需要粗布，各廠均紡十支紗，原料之接濟極不茹。工人工作效率小，工資低。惟電力荼充沛，各廠錠子全開。</p>
<p>東北紗業困難重重</p>
<p>六區代表奚玉　，報吿蘇浙皖三省及京滬兩市之紡廠情形，列舉數字證明復員之迅速，惟本市因此咸覺電荒，迄今尙未解決。燃料之供應，亦爲困難問題。工人問題，一切情形，尙堪滿意。目前亟待研討者，爲紗價之合理議定，否則紗廠將不能順利再生產。原料工資高漲而獨抑紗價，實非合理之政策。</p>
<p>七區代表揚亦周報吿天津區情形，謂該區國營紗廠約佔八成，餘爲民營。公會成立後，曾與稅局交涉减免捐稅，並解決各廠之工潮問題。今年棉　比去年增三之一，但巡輸阻斷，特提案請大會硏究以行總空運大隊運輸棉花之方案。又北方經敵人佔領最久，紗廠損失最大，希望政府特別體會扶植。</p>
<p>九區代表報吿靑島及山東紗業，謂該區紗廠三十餘，集中於靑島及濟南兩城市，因共單之盤据，兩城均勢如孤島，故困難特多。希望中央能多　棉貸，以便收購原棉。又煤之配額太少，必需改善。紗廠所需之五金材料，素向津滬採購，亦多困難。工資較戰前平均提高八萬倍，但工潮仍多。</p>
<p>最後由東北區代表報吿，調在敵偽時代，東北紗綻有五十四萬枚，布機有一萬台，今則因種種關係，能開工之紗綻不過十萬枚，布機不過五千台。以原棉而論，棉田均在遼寗南部，今日之產嚴僅爲敵僞時代三分之一。日本人用各稱方式、强迫推廣棉田，一多至七十萬畝。今則糧價高於棉價，農民改種糧食，致棉田之面積銳减，今年棉花之最高產量爲二十萬担。今後棉貨之　放，棉田之推廣，實爲要聞。東北煤之供應，亦感不足。電力則自中共五次攻勢後，小　滿電力斷絕，當時各紗廠會爲之停工一月，目前所用者，爲資委會工廠之餘電，僅及過去電量之三分之一。故軍事上如無開展，紗業前途困難殊多。各區代表報吿畢，秘書處報告收到各方賀電，並提案七十二件。大會宣言，經通過推舉東　章吳味經王啓宇等七人爲起草委員。大會於零時　分散會。</p>
<p>主要提案審查完畢</p>
<p>午後三時續開小組會議審査提案，當時重要提案審査完畢。主要者計有：　台　煤已生產過剩，應設法改善對於大陸之供應案。　以后設立新廠，政府應嚴格指定地區案。　西南西北之紗廠在抗戰中受損甚重，應請政府優待案。　紗業國火代表，應增爲四名，立委應增爲兩名案。　原棉之運輸，應請行總空運大隊協助案。　國內外機器配件均感困難，應于國內設廣自造案。　戰後各國紡織技　進步，應請派考察團出國考察案等。</p>
<p>輪業聊會觀宴代表</p>
<p>晚間七時，輪船業聯合會，假招商局歡宴全體代表，杜月笙，束　　，徐學禹等相繼致　，均强　紡織業與輪船業爲我國國計民生上兩大關鍵事業，特別在爭取南洋市塲之今日，非紗布無以爭取外匯，非本　輪船運輸，亦將不能與勁敵日木競爭，故兩業州之聯合奮鬥，實爲必要。今日上午續開大會，通過提案，午後進行選舉後閉幕。</p>
<h3>火油供稀價昂</h3>
<p>火油市面，邇日雖有中美公司派貨，為數不多，市上需求殷切，仍感供不敷求做開行情迭升不已，近日高度桶油價昂至一百七十二三萬元間有賣出。美孚聰裝同業互做二十一萬至萬五千元，均有成交。門市場售價每提四千五百元，足斤售五千元云。</p>
<h3>工業協會　昨招待報界</h3>
<p>上海市工業協會，昨（廿一）日下午三時，招待各報社記者，由田和卿報吿該會限額織入原料分配情形。</p>
<h3>糧食業要求　免徵營業稅</h3>
<p>本市米商業公會雜糧商業公會粉麩業公會以中央續免糧食業營業稅一年至本年九月底止，又將滿限。茲各地糧商因內亂不已，　　　退，交通阻塞，　食供應受世界糧荒影響，未見暢通。蘇浙皖贛及京滬杭七省市場商聊會及糧商團體前曾晋京向當局諸願，竟未邀準，現正在發動二次擴大請願。該會封此決予採取一致步驟。現以市參議會四次大會定今（廿二）日揭幕，特於昨日向該會提出該項議案，請付本屆大會討論。並懇呼籲中央及市政當局賜准恢復免征糧食營業稅云。</p>

<h3>新醫與新藥　上海市醫師公會主編　對南京市立醫院　事件之我見</h3>
<p>— 幵里</p>
<p>南京市立醫院外科醫師錢明　因忠於職守熟心爲病人服務，竟蒙業務過失的罪名，受徒刑的宣判，此種不幸新聞，債令吾等從事科學醫的人們萬分憤慨！前既拜讀本刊梁俊靑光生的誌哀大作，近又讚吾醫師公會宣言，深覺胸臆中爲是案所引起的不平的抑鬱已盡代吾人宣洩無餘了。可是尙有數點，米經提及，似乎骨鯁在喉，不得不以一吐爲快因特不自揣其拙陋，再借本刊一角，願與開心是案人士，一研討之。</p>
<p>第一依醫院慣例，手術之前必須經過病人家族或其關係人負責簽字手術志願書，聲明萬一在手術中途或手術以後遇有不測，決無異議。此種志願書在法律上應有絕對效力。現在吾人姑置有關是案之一切學理上爭論而不議，如果病家確已簽具志願書，而在事後仍不免發生糾葛，不啻病家自食其言，自背其信，首應負此責任，更何能抹煞事實，反欲故人當事醫師於罪呢。吾誠不知此案發生於當初，即在錢　師執行開割手術以前，病家曾否層行簽字於手術志願書的乎續？因爲京滬距離相當路程，査詢非易一時實亦無由懸測。說不定錢醫師無辜受累，而病家的食言背信也有關係。第二，麻醉中途發生意外以致不起，在醫學上稱爲麻醉死，自有麻醉術以來，海內外各種醫學文獻都有詳細記載，決非南京市立醫師所獨開的創例。此種麻醉劑死的原因，依現在硏究結果，不外中毒和休克二端。中毒由於用量過度所致，當然有毒現象，可在屍體證明。　於休克則完全由於體質關係，尤其像胸腺淋巴性體質，最易陷於麻醉死，然亦可在屍體內證明。現在耍根究，南京市立醫院所開刀的病人，何以會發生意外？倘將屍體付之解剖，自不難水落石出，而法醫檢騐時竟爲思慮所不及，　覺可憾！第三，法官論獄固貴自由心證，能俯仰隨人，便失却持平公正。但事實上所許自由取捨的，僅限於禮俗人情範關以內設使遇有關涉科學的問題，而也不顧現世眞知灼見的原理，任意左右必致笑話百出。譬如現代科學家，已證明地爲球形，如果法律上需所引據，自然應服從地圓學說，決不能因古人有天圓地方之言論，而變說地球非賀呢！現在所關涉的醫學問題，當然也　科學的一種。就麻醉而論，麻醉時所用的麻醉藥品，根本就有全身麻醉和局部麻醉的區別。全身麻醉藥係作用於中樞神經的·像醚和哥羅芳是的。局部麻醉藥係作用於周圍神經的，像古卡因和普羅卡因之類是的。此二類藥劑雖同　麻醉性質，可是各藥劑的藥理，互有不同。不獨醚和哥羅芳的藥性不可與古卡因和普羅卡因的藥性混爲一談，就是醚與哥羅芳中間，古卡因與普羅卡因中間也有很大距離。譬如醚的副作用，刺激心臟較少，刺激呼吸系器官較多。哥羅芳的副作用，刺激心臟較多而刺激呼吸器官則較少。適巧成爲反對性質。還有古卡因，副作用能興奮延腦，收縮血管，所以間接能影響於呼吸和心臟，但是普羅卡因，對延腦，對血管都無作用，也和古卡因立于相對地位。因此有人如欲論斷麻醉劑的利弊，必須仔細認識麻醉藥的個性。倘使籠統說出，那就不免指東　西，發生和科學原理矛盾的結果。吾對於錢醫師的被累案件，總覺內中不無滲入這些成份呢。</p>
<p>第四，又讀南京寄來市立醫院全體醫師的文吿，內中轉裁判決書摘要，有「上項麻醉劑必須心肺腎神經正常者始可適用，尤爲有心臟病者所不宜，」一節，不知有否筆誤？依字面論，好像引用的一種醫學上定理。現在爲了這定理，已翻遍手頭所有的參考書籍，無論藥理學，外科學，手術學以及外科手册，都找不到和此近似的條文。尤其腎字更不知所指爲何事？就以前所硏究過病理學方面去思索，也想像不起，普羅卡因對於泌尿系作用有何深切關係，而必須禁忌的。更推廣些說，凡腎機能失常者，最多表現的是血管硬化症，對於血管硬化病人，即使需用麻醉手術也不必多所猶疑。固然像古卡因，所收縮血管增加血壓的，但爲麻醉目的，時間有一定，用量有限度即使應用，變不致引起危險，其余根本無刺激血管作用的麻醉劑，更無禁忌的必要，所以始終認此腎字爲筆誤。</p>
<h3>外傷可使老病惡化</h3>
<p>— 梁俊靑</p>
<p>摘要言之，一個以前從未發病之五十三歲男子，於去年十一月廿六日外傷，以胸部重撞於硬地上。入天後似乎已經痊愈而忽然吐血，且有輕度寒熱。受傷廿四日後有不規則之寒熱，於受傷後第三十九及第四十天晚上則惡寒高熱。在受傷六十天後所攝之X光片上已可認明爲粟粒性結核症之發作。而在受傷第十天後所攝之X光片上則尙無任何一種可能變爲粟粒性結核之症象。又在受傷廿六日後所攝之照片亦僅爲有可疑之充血現象而已。病者於受傷第八十六天後身故。</p>
<p>病者之屍體曾經解剖，證實爲粟粒性結核症且可認爲乃從已經休止之老結核症病灶因受傷之故而突然懇化所致。</p>
<p>理由：　其粟粒性結核症之出發點爲肺門之石灰質硬化病灶，尤其右肺下業之石灰質硬化病灶地點更爲明顯。其琳巴腺之分佈情形甚爲廣闊而奇特，亦作粟粒性狀態（以上皆根據屍體解剖之檢騐報吿）。此可證明其惡化情形與臨床方面之惡寒高熱狀態相符合。　在右肺第五肋骨及近心臟處有銀元大小之纖維性癒着狀態，此爲肋膜與肺臟粘連之徵，亦即局部肋膜炎曾經發生之處（Pleuritis　epifocalis）。此處之癒合情形甚爲濃厚，結蒂組織甚多，定爲老年之結核病灶無疑。在此附近有幾處呈顯明之出血狀熊反應。此當然爲其不久以前曾經吐血之故。　其肺炎之初期結核病灶早已成爲石灰質化，可調與粟粒性結核症之發生完全無關。　其吐血與老病灶完全無關，因據屍體解剖，老病灶既無空洞，又無乳酪化情形，可以說絕對不致發生吐血情形。反之，其吐血情形，實可斷定與受傷右關。吾人根據屍體檢査，可以斷定其曾經患有肋膜炎之　着處因受外來之撞擊而受損出血。蓋右肺下葉之癒　處於受外傷時不易移動（其未粘連之處當然可以移動）而產生出血，及組織之受損。因之結核病菌便從老病灶而竄入於血管內，演變成急性之粟粒性結核症矣。（詳載一九四七年第廿四期Prof.　Lofler氏所撰之瑞士醫學周報）</p>
<p>根據上述的記載，我們就可以曉得一種已經休止的，可以說是已經痊愈的病症在某種意外之情形中（即外傷）忽然惡化起來，尤以已經休止的結核症更加容易有此種變化。（Loffler曾述有另一症例因文長不備錄）。</p>
<p>因此，我的信念改變了，天下問竟有許多意外的意外呢。可不是嗎？從前在報上讀得一段消息，有一人與人戲謔而給另一人一拳，適中其左上腹。給果此人踣地而斃。事後屍體剖騐則死者生前患有瘧疾，其脾臟腫大異常，因一擊而脾臟破裂出血而死矣</p>
<p>假使他一生不受人拳擊，那末他也許可以長命到七八十歲的一，可是這一擊就是他的致命傷，一把他的整個生命結束了。</p>
<p>因此，我說外傷可使老病惡一化。（續完）</p>

<h3>瞻望未來的科學世界</h3>
<p>— 鋼人</p>
<p>是不是原子能的動力將來結束媒和油的世紀，而取代他們？這，許多科學家，都已認爲紙是時間的問題了。世界上，正有許多的組織,在許多優秀的科學家領導和合作之下，針對薺這方面而努力。擁有龐大資源的美國人，更極力想趕在別人的前面，而在漢臨特和橡樹城（Hanford　&amp;　Oakrige）裏建立起偉大的動力廠來，以取代今日每小時所消耗的七千一百加侖汽油和三十八·五噸的煤。</p>
<p>在這裏，最大的困難，即在如何隔絕危險的輻射作用。科學家正集中全力在找得一個比鉛和混凝土更爲堅實·輕便而有效的物質。也許是和鉛質那樣的薄板，不用吸收輻射能的那種費力的舊方法，而反射和集中那些射錢的新計劃。</p>
<p>因爲沒有輕質的原子能的阻礙物，那麼原子能至多也祗能作為動力廠，火車或無人飛機的運川了。</p>
<p>現在還沒有人知道，原子能是否比現在的動力更爲經濟，無論如何，這不單是沒有煤汕出產地帶的福音，也將解決日趨嚴軍的煤荒問題，而使明日的飛機能繞地球數周而不需添加燃料。</p>
<p>因此，人類也決不會像從前的笨方法，把內燃機駕上四輪的馬車，就是說强迫他適合現代的機械，可能地原子能直接化爲電力，而不再經過那最缺乏效率的熱力循環。美國西屋硏究實驗室的黑契遜博士（Dr.J.A.Hutchson　of　Westinghouse　Resaarch　Laboracory）曾指出，用射入金屬片而獲得電力的電池效應那一願的方法，也許是新的一種。</p>
<p>再有，我們的原子能，現在是從擎破重原子來的，用最重的原料｜鈾二三五和次一級的錫；而原子能的始祖，星　，至少是太陽，他的放射光是由氧的結合成氦而得來的，這便是大戰時德國所極力研究，爲聯合各國所破壊的方法，如果人類能够在以後做到的話，那麽原子能更是便利而用不完的東西了。這在美國的宇宙綫研究工作，和蘇聯的原子能硏究會的努力下，可能有成功的希望。</p>
<p>今後世界的動力界，正有無限的美麗的前途。</p>
<p>飛機的進步和改革的設計，將便人類達到能控制被爆炸力所矗孽前進的速度，以越音速而上，達到過應宇宙航行的目的。</p>
<p>在地球上，美國在阿拉斯加的北極航行研究，將藉改良了的飛機，去到尙未有人到過的土地上去開墾那興富的資源。</p>
<p>在廣播事業的新進展上，更可以見到燦爛的遠景。因爲天空裹正是非常的寬廣，儘够我們的電波往來。</p>
<p>不曾太遠吧？無綫電話，電視，超短波綱在遮遍了世界，許多的廣播，電話通訊，電報，電傳照相，電影，在無聲中傳送。</p>
<h3>金屬小論</h3>
<p>— 友仃</p>
<p>金屬的種類繁多，然決無一萬能而足供人類應用於各方者；飛機工程所要一種堅如鋼，輕若木，像黃金般不易腐蝕而且又要易鎔易壓易拉的金屬，而漁夫要能善沉的金屬，電燈製造却要一種在攝氏一萬度的溫度下仍不鎔化金屬。觀乎此，我們就知道要有一種萬能而能適合任何方面的需要的金屬，誠爲不可能者。現在我們且就歲種金屬，略予討論。</p>
<p>鉛—任何人都知道鉛不生銹，能忍受數百年氣候的變選與風霜；鉛簡可用來裝盛硫酸因爲百分之七十五濃度的硫酸尙不能溶解它。然而在微器內的硫酸。可由百分之九十者進而成百分之百濃度者，這種濃酸便可立刻將鉛溶解。在稀酸中，鉛的表面爲一薄暦之硫酸鉛所包掩，而硫酸鉛是不溶於水的，故鉛片可免於被溶，裝稀硫酸，多用鉛筒鉛器。</p>
<p>鋁—鋁不怕硫酸硝酸，但是怕强鹼；氮化鋁通常不與酸類起反應，故可用作精美的橱鍋。化學工業利用鋁來裝盛酸類而不能裝盛鹼類。鋁的密度是二點七，其重如同玻璃石片；普通以爲鋁很輕，這是拿它與其他（他金屬相比，多數金屬部比水重六點五倍至十一倍。但若與塑料，木質及通常之流體相比，鋁就未免選嫌重了點。</p>
<p>鎂—鎂恰與鋁相反，它不怕試驗，在試驗中鎂被一層氫氣化鎂包裹着，本身即與水及氫氣隔絕。能溶解鉑等堅强金屬的强鹼也不能觸動及鎂，但却常爲果酸或植物酸等弱酸所洞蝕。鎂雖然怕酸類，但有一件怪事，即鎂反而不怕蝕腐性極兇的濃氟氫酸，這是因爲氟化，鎂不溶於氟氣酸的緣故。鎂的密度是一·七四，雖比最重的木質重一點，但比鋁輕得多。鎂是一種良好的金屬，粗硬堅强而又能抵抗腐蝕；而且，在某數種情形下，鎂是唯一佔優勢的金屬，爲其他金屬所不及。</p>
<p>鋰—鋰乃是金屬中最輕的一種，能浮起於汽油面上；但不幸鋰乃是一位很嬌生慣養的楺弱千金，它幾乎一見氧化物或氫化物便要溶解；它是一種最活潑的金屬，幾乎一與濕空氣接觸即馬上腐蝕。鋰與其友伴鈉，鉀及鉫（Rubidium）等實在很輕，而且柔軟得可以雙手或雙指揉扭。</p>
<p>鈹—鈹（Beryllium）的密底是一·八五，略重於鎂，它雖然輕，却有如鋼般的硬度。它的熔點很高，一如鋼等重金屬；它有强大的抗蝕力。不過鈹也有其缺點，其純鈹或多數鈹的合金多硬而易碎，且鈹很難自其附屬之礦石中析出，藏量也不集中。</p>
<p>其他—銥（Iridiunl）能抵抗一切化學作用之攻擊，不若其他金屬需要特別條件情况才能抵遇腐蝕。鐵的密度是八，在濃硫酸中因爲不溶之硫酸鐵所掩，不溶化其中。銫（Caesium）及銀（Stromtium）爲鈹之米族”極活潑脆弱，目前尙無何用途。鉑雖然是最不易侵蝕者，但仍怕夷焰（Soooty　Name），因爲　是碳，鉑可與碳起某種反應，又鉑製坩鍋中不能溶入碳酸鈉，否則碳酸鈉即將使鉑溶化。</p>
<h3>海底千里耳</h3>
<p>— 趙南</p>
<p>美國海軍部在戰時發明了一種深海千里耳，名字呌做Sofar，如果譯成上海話，便是：「聽遠」的意思。這種海底千里耳，利用聲音傳播的原理，用幾何三角的算學方法，能够測定遠處遭難的船舶，滅頂的飛機以及孤立無援的救生小艇，駕駛員當遭遇危險時，事光便丟下海中一枚深水炸彈，炸彈沉入海中四千呎便會自動炸裂，因此發生巨大的爆炸聲音，能使三千英里以內的海底千里耳發生作用，從而測定遇難的地點，這種測定，非常準確，錯誤不及一英里云。</p>
<h3>木材新製品</h3>
<p>— 唐燿</p>
<p>加熱造形性（Thermoplastic）：美國林產所木材乾燥專家當1941年，於進行上述之化學乾燥試驗時，偶以1/4吋之標木，浸於濃尿素（Urea）溶液內，常熱至華氏212度時，此木片變成像皮式之柔軟性質，可任意曲折扭轉；及木村變冷，其曲折之形狀，可以保持不變。羅氏更用鋸層試騐，亦可壓平而自行貼合爲一薄板。其後經進一步之硏究，已製就尿素加熱型成木（UralloyA.B.C）三種；因之，此偶然被發現木材之新性質，實已開闢木材利用上一新紀元。</p>
<p>加壓木（Compreg）美:國加壓木之製造，原於阻止太材脹縮性之硏究。常斯丹姆氏注射數種人造樹脂於木材內；在加熱時（Heat-ancreasin　Process），發現木材疑爲柔軟可曲折之狀態（Plastic），可施以壓力，使其緊縮。渠用輕柔之木材，經壓縮至原體積1/3時，其强度可比之軟鋼。經詳加研究，此項技術，可施之於通常之木材，並模之爲定形（Molded　to　Destined　Shape）；或採用黏合之木材（即已經例爲薄片，經膠黏爲層次狀者），製就所需之大小形狀，視强度而予取予求。加壓木具抗水性，能不被酒精及溫和之酸類所侵蝕，已被採用於飛機螺旋漿之製造。據云美國密歇根州即有一公司，採用此法，以模製螺旋漿尾輪及支柱等。其製造費用，雖在重事上不算昂貴；但用於一般之建築，似尙待硏究，以减輕其成本。惟以之模製工業用齒輪滑車等，頗有可能。</p>
<p>加壓抗縮木（Staypak）：爲美國林產所近年來所發明精製木之最新產品。其優點在加壓加熱處理時，不需人造樹脂，因之可視爲改進之加壓木。據1945年一月，美國木材製品雜誌（Wood　Products）所載，謂製造之技術，主在避免木材加壓後，遇水之回脹。斯氏對木材阻止脹縮之原理與技術，研究有素，認為木材在加工期，若能利用黏結木材細胞壁木身之木材質，使之具有流動性（Made　Lignin　to　Flow），可能防止細胞壁上應力（Stress）之產生。惟此種情形，雖在高溫下可以達到，但同時木材亦被焦灼。因此技術上之焦點，乃在解決減低雙木材質為流動狀態之溫度。經多次試驗，結果發現「水」可促成木材質之流動性，爲一種甚佳之助型料（Plasticizier），因之製造技術遂被解決。製造加壓抗縮木　木材，其含水量須較加壓木為大，如是在相當高之溫度下，加壓至適當時間·可將木材壓縮至比重達1.6或1.4所用木材，為通常1　1/2時厚之時體，或已經用人造樹脂黏結成層之薄木，（Veneers）；因之除黏結層板所需之人造樹脂外，無須注射更多之樹脂。</p>
<p>加壓抗縮木之顏色，較通常之太材爲深。加壓面經琢廣後平滑，具光澤與加壓木相似。以金工具可以割削自如。在同樣含水量及比重下，加驗抗縮木之縱紋及橫紋抗壓力均較抗壓木爲小；但縱紋抗拉力及抗折力，則較抗壓木大25％。據記載紋理平行之履板加壓抗縮木，其抗拉强及抗折强每方時為40000-45000磅，約當美國黃牌之二倍，美國西加雲杉之三倍。加壓抗縮木之韌性較加壓木强一倍。材質輕柔之楊木杉木，經加工後，其强度可操過最强之商用材。加壓抗縮木在大氣中膨脹甚微微，惟與一般木材同，將漸漸風化；因之於戶外，不若有加壓木之不需油漆。</p>
<p>加壓抗縮木之製造費用，較加壓木爲廉，質亦較韌；困之在戰後改進之小型飛機，以及器柄柱基滑車無聲齒輪等需强韌不變形之用途上，頗有價值。</p>
<p>以上略就已知之數種木材精製品，述其大要；不過多種新技術，因涉及工業秘密，尙語焉不詳，未能與其與妙。惟改造木材之材性，要不外：一，使低分于量與木材有親和力之人造樹脂，形成於木材細胞之微細結構內，使水分無由出入；二，利用木材質本身之可型性。三·木材經尿素等處理之加熱造形性（即在熟時木材可以曲折自如，冷却後保持不變）。因此人造樹脂於木材黏結之新技術，可謂已促使苦人對於木材之應用上發生新的革命。目下吾國金屬工業尚未去蕪發達，若何就吾國木材，加以改進，木屑等廢料，加以利用，織吾國料學家所應急起消遣者。</p>

<h3>化學鋸</h3>
<p>— 德</p>
<p>蘇聯高爾藝城的斯太林工廠最近發明了一種新的切斷硬金屬的方法，那是一種電力和機械的混合作用，這種方法使用的鋸子是一個一呎直徑，光滑而薄的圓盤，圓盤的裝置和普通的鋸子沒有什麽兩樣，轉達每分鐘約二千至三千轉，和一個發電機的正極連接，被切的金屬則和負極連接，開動後被切的部份產生一種特殊的電解物｜因電流經過起了化學分解，於是均衡作用迫使鋸子工作，電流在經過電解物時迅速的使金屬分離。</p>
<h3>月亮上掉下來的岩石</h3>
<p>— 劉達德</p>
<p>奉令桅耳（H.H.Nininger)氏認為月石（Moonstone）並不是一種寳石，却是從月亮上掉下來的岩石，他說這種石頭種為Tektite，是被大而且速的隕石所撞碎而離開月球的，奈令格爾氏是美國硏究隕石的權威，所以他發表任何關於這方面的說法，都會引起廣大的注意。</p>
<p>地球和別的太陽系的行星全遭受到隕石經常的撞擊，是天文學家們所公認的事，地球表面有一層空氣，可以保護它以反抗隕石的壤擊，所以當隕石以高速度向地球衝來。穿過大氣層時必將發生摩擦，因而發熱至白熱程度，燃燒起來。</p>
<p>月亮却不然，它表面並沒有一層空氣，隕石也就可以不必經過燃燒而很容易胡到達月球上了，事實上有一些天文學家把相信月球上許多凹下去的噴火口全是隕石碰撞的成績。</p>
<p>不管我們承認這理論與否，下列的事實却是一定的：一個高速度的隕石衝向月球時，會產生强大的然量，常隕石與月球相碰撞時，這些熱量即將全部化為蒸氣，這時有一種恐怖的爆炸繼之發生，而碎裂月球表面的一些岩石使拋向空中，這些亘石立即被碰撞時發生的熱所熔化，若是它掉到地球上來，便成爲一種圓而似玻璃狀的石塊，稱爲Tektite。</p>
<p>雖然大部份從月球上拋出來的岩石仍將落回去，可是因爲地球的地心吸力較月亮的大，所以一小部份却仍可逃出月亮胡範圍，假使有一塊這樣熔化了的岩石進入地球地心吸力範圍，那麼它就掉到地面上來了。</p>

<h3>On the Method of Voting at the Peace Conference with Japan: The US Will Consult with Us; Invitation to the Eleven-Nation Conference Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 21st] Following China's decision to cooperate with the Soviet Union and insist on using the great power veto in the preliminary eleven-nation peace conference with Japan, the US intention to issue invitations to hold the eleven-nation conference has been abandoned. The US originally intended to issue invitations within a few days, but China's position has hardened over the past week, making it virtually necessary to hold Sino-American consultations to seek some agreement on this issue.</p>
<p>Britain, France, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and India have all expressed their willingness to hold this eleven-nation conference, adopting a two-thirds majority vote as the method of voting and prohibiting any country from using the veto.</p>
<p>Before China's surprising move, Britain and the US decided that, due to the urgency of the issue, it was worth ignoring the Soviet Union and proceeding with a risky conference, while hoping that the Soviet Union would change its mind at the last minute. Observers in this area, who have close contact with the situation in the Far East, have diverging opinions on the motivation behind China's decision.</p>
<p>One opinion is that China was stimulated by Wedemeyer's criticism of the central government and was deeply disgusted by the US's failure to provide economic assistance and its public criticism of Chinese politics, so it "shifted all its weight to the other side," reminding the US that China has a pivotal influence on decisions regarding the Far East in the Far Eastern Commission and other agreements.</p>
<p>Another opinion is that China's action this time is intended to bargain with the US to obtain economic assistance. The highest-level officials here admit that they lack definite indications of China's ultimate goal. They hope that in the next two weeks, with the help of talks with Foreign Minister Wang and Chinese Ambassador to the US Dr. Wellington Koo, the situation can be clarified.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 20th] Our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie issued a statement yesterday at the request of the International News Service, clarifying our country's attitude towards the peace conference with Japan. Wang stated that the resolutions of the conference should be adopted by a majority vote, but must include the unanimous vote of the four major powers (China, Britain, the US, and the Soviet Union), rather than just a two-thirds majority vote as suggested by the US.</p>
<h3>Wedemeyer's Report Temporarily Not to be Released</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 21st] People here predicted today that the results of Special Envoy Wedemeyer's six-week on-the-spot investigation in China and Korea would not be released immediately. After returning to Beijing, Wedemeyer told welcoming personnel that the special envoy's report, along with recommendations, had been drafted and would soon be submitted to the State Department for review, but he remained silent on the content. He also said with a smile that any questions could be directed to Mr. Watson, the group's spokesman.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper News] New York, 21st Broadcast: Officials in Washington issued opinions today stating that the US is extremely willing to assist China, even to a greater extent than in the past. However, until some undesirable elements in the National Government are removed and administrative reforms are made, there is little hope for the success of further US assistance to China. General Wedemeyer has solemnly pointed out this point. If China has the sincerity to reform, it will definitely be able to accept the meaning contained in Wedemeyer's statement.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Nanjing, 21st] Government commissioners stated today that the rumors that the National Government might be forced to seek rapprochement with the Soviet Union unless the US provides immediate assistance to China are absolutely untrue. This view is only the result of the growing impatience of some people with the US's failure to adopt a firm policy towards China. China has neither changed its foreign policy nor intends to do so. The biggest problem at present lies in the nature of the "supervisory" conditions attached to future US aid. Generally, officials do not object to normal supervision of the use of funds, but instinctively express concern about the concept of foreign supervision. The US must further understand this psychology of the Chinese people.</p>
<h3>President Zhang Inspects Anshan; Departs Today for Changchun, Then Turns to North China</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 21st] President Zhang went to Anshan at 8:00 am on the 21st to personally inspect the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant. He was guided by Xie Shuying and Shao Yizhou of the National Resources Commission. Many provincial and municipal leaders from Shenyang followed along. The special train passed through Liaoyang at 9:00 am and stopped for ten minutes. Zhang got off the train and met a person in charge of the station, inquiring about traffic and telecommunications conditions. Arriving at the steel city at about 10:00 am, smoke filled the air. The number of departments in operation had greatly increased compared to before. Of the nine steelmaking furnaces standing tall, one with a capacity of 400 tons has been repaired and can start steelmaking in early October. The rest are being repaired and welded. One furnace in the steelmaking plant has already started smelting. All factories for rolling steel and casting machines are in operation, tense and busy, which is exciting. Of the 17 rows of coking furnaces in the coking plant, one row has been repaired. The coking whole furnace coke seems to be poured with water into the car box, forming a red-hot piece. The output of coke by-products, such as fertilizer powder and petroleum, is also high. At the steel primary rolling plant, President Zhang cut the ribbon to resume operations. A five-ton red ingot was repeatedly rolled and cut into steel blocks of various sizes. The roar of the machines was thrilling. Zhang repeatedly wished the employees success. Returning to Shenyang at 4:45 pm, Chen Cheng, concurrently director, and Chen Yanting, special commissioner of the Northeast External Affairs Department, and Sun Yueqi, vice chairman of the National Resources Commission, who returned to Shenyang on the 21st, accompanied him to visit the National Resources Commission's locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing plant. After that, President Zhang discussed Northeast industrial and mining issues with Sun Yueqi, Xie Shuying, and others. At 8:00 pm, he attended a reception for provincial and municipal leaders. Zhang is scheduled to fly to Changchun on the 22nd, then turn to North China for inspection.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Changchun, 21st] The Changchun Provisional Consultative Council sent a special telegram to President Zhang Qun, welcoming him to Changchun for inspection.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 21st] President Zhang said after returning to Shenyang from Anshan on the afternoon of the 21st that his impressions were threefold: First, he admired the Japanese construction; Second, he regretted the demolition and destruction; Third, he was delighted with the working spirit of the factory employees.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Takes Charge of Guangdong; Welcomed by All Sectors in Guangzhou and Hong Kong; Luo Zhuoying Prepares to Hand Over</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 21st] Since the news of Song Ziwen taking charge of Guangdong was released, the reaction from all parties here has been quite positive. It is generally believed that Song will have detailed plans for economic reform, financial stability, overseas Chinese investment, and industrial construction in South China. Chairman Luo Zhuoying, in preparation for the handover, convened a symposium of responsible persons under his jurisdiction. Luo read a telegram from Chairman Chiang, which stated, "It is proposed to invite you to serve in Nanjing. Comrade Song Ziwen is appointed to take over as Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government. The personnel of the Provincial Government will remain as they were, with no major changes. Please inform them to continue to serve diligently." Luo Min was deeply moved by the Chairman's concern for his subordinates and then stated: "I have always believed that public servants should only work hard in their positions and should not have the idea of political territory. Personal changes in work positions are irrelevant to the overall provincial administration. As for the handover, it should be done quickly and accurately, and there should be no negligence, especially regarding money and public property."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 20th, United Press International] All Chinese newspapers in Guangzhou unanimously welcomed Song Ziwen's appointment to Guangdong. These newspapers pointed out that first, Song has always maintained prestige in Guangdong; second, Song is an ideal figure to oversee the long-promoted five-year construction plan for Guangdong; third, Song is an ideal figure for foreign negotiations, as Song is from Hainan Island and is very interested in the development of South China. In 1936, he had consulted with the British to assist in the development of South China, but Japan entered South China in 1938, causing Song's overall plan to fall through. However, a subordinate of Song's recently resumed negotiations with the British, and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation also participated in the talks.</p>
<h3>Nathan Flies to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] British Minister of Civil Aviation Lord Nathan left Beijing at 8:30 am on the 21st and flew to Hong Kong to return to Britain. On the way, he will visit Bangkok, Singapore, and other places to investigate civil aviation conditions.</p>
<h3>Fourth Batch of Japanese Warships Scheduled to Arrive in Qingdao on the 25th for Surrender</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 21st] Naval sources revealed that the fourth batch of surrendered Japanese ships has been inspected and the ten ships obtained by our side are scheduled to arrive in Qingdao on the 25th to be received by the 21st Base Command of the Navy.</p>
<h3>Shao Lizi's Talk Denies That He Will Be Appointed as Ambassador to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Nanjing, 21st] Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the National Political Council, stated today: "The rumors that I will be appointed as Ambassador to the Soviet Union. I am very grateful to the press for giving me such an important position, but I have not heard anything about it myself." According to diplomatic sources here, Shao has past experience as an envoy to the Soviet Union, and it is still very possible that he will be reappointed this time.</p>
<h3>Chen Zhiping Asks Overseas Chinese to Support the Government in Suppressing the Rebellion</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 20th] The General Chamber of Commerce of our overseas Chinese here and several other overseas Chinese public associations held a banquet last night to welcome Envoy Chen Zhiping, who is going to Nanjing to report on his work. Envoy Chen gave a long speech on the spot, recounting the various relations between China and the Philippines in the past year. At the same time, he appealed to our overseas Chinese to continue to support and promote direct contact with friends in the Philippine social and political circles, so that the friendly relations between China and the Philippines can be further enhanced. He also said that the political situation in the motherland can indeed affect the status of overseas Chinese, so he emphasized that our overseas Chinese have the responsibility to support the suppression of the rebellion and the revival of the country, and our government also has absolute confidence in defeating the Communist Party, but all Chinese people should obey their leaders and do their best to fulfill their patriotic duties.</p>
<h3>Chen Cheng States That Rectifying Military Discipline in the Northeast is Being Intensified; Zhu Huaibing Responds to a Telegram Invitation to Fly to Shenyang Soon</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 21st] Chen Cheng, concurrently director, stated that the issue of rectifying military discipline in the Northeast, which is of concern to everyone, is being intensified. Guerrilla units that harm the people and commanders without troops will also be strictly suppressed.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hankou, 21st] Chen Cheng, concurrently director of the Northeast Headquarters, recently sent a telegram inviting Zhu Huaibing, the current magistrate of Huanggang County and a member of the Central Executive Committee, to meet with him. Zhu is scheduled to fly to Shenyang soon. In addition, Hu Shuhua, a member of the Central Executive Committee, passed through Hankou yesterday on his way to Hunan.</p>
<h3>Four Supervisory Committee Members Return to Nanjing After Investigating the Use of Foreign Exchange; Generally Satisfied, No Discrimination Against Foreign Businesses; Drafting of Report to Begin Today</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] He Hanwen, Du Guangxun, Wang Guanwu, and Gu Fengxiang, the four Supervisory Committee members who went to Shanghai to investigate the government's use of foreign exchange and the applications for foreign exchange by Yangtze, Fuzhong, and other companies, have completed their work after two weeks of investigation in Shanghai. They returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 21st, and in the afternoon, they went together to visit President Yu to report on their findings. They decided to hold a meeting on the 22nd to discuss drafting the report. With the assistance of all parties, the four Supervisory Committee members were able to work smoothly and obtained a great deal of information, collecting a large number of files. Because all parties are very concerned about this case, they plan to submit the report within a week.</p>
<p>He and his party went to Shanghai on the 7th. During their stay in Shanghai, they worked very hard and refused unnecessary social engagements. The focus of the investigation was on the application, approval, quota allocation, and import of foreign exchange. They successively went to the China Trust Bureau, the Materials Supply Bureau, and other agencies related to the supply of materials for investigation. They also investigated the various foreign exchange materials of the Central Bank's Import and Export Commission and other agencies, as well as the issuance of permits. In order to understand the actual situation, they also went to the customs and the wharves of Gonghexiang and other companies for inspection. Finally, they went to Yangtze, Fuzhong, China Construction, Jialing, Nanyang Enterprise, and other related companies to review files. Some of their accounts are being checked by two officials from the Ministry of Audit who are still staying in Shanghai. They will also be able to return to Nanjing next week.</p>
<p>According to a Supervisory Committee member who went to investigate, the most profound impression of this trip to Shanghai was that the government's past management of foreign exchange was too lax, and there was indeed waste. It is said that the government originally had about 800 million US dollars in foreign exchange, but by the end of last year, more than 300 million US dollars had been spent, which is a pity. Until recently, the control has been too tight. Since the issuance of self-supplied foreign exchange import permits was suspended on the 18th of last month, many materials have been stockpiled at the wharves and cannot be extracted. Among them are many necessities or production raw materials, which will definitely affect production. When they were in Shanghai, they went to visit a certain wharf and saw that there were more than 300 cars that could not enter due to non-compliance with procedures. If combined with other wharves, the number would be five or six hundred. It is heard that the total value of these materials is as high as 100 million US dollars. Since Shanghai cannot transport them in, it seems possible that they will be smuggled into the country through Hong Kong, which would be another loss to the country. The economic circles in Shanghai hope that a reasonable solution can be found. The Supervisory Committee members will also make suggestions on this.</p>
<p>The Supervisory Committee members stated that they are generally satisfied with the current foreign exchange policy, in addition to making suggestions on the above-mentioned phenomena. At the same time, this investigation of foreign exchange is the third investigation in recent years. The suggestions that were made before will not be raised again this time, and any suggestions will be based on new materials. Chinese and foreign merchants have complained about the foreign exchange policy, but some of them have not handled the necessary procedures in accordance with the law, and they cannot be held fully responsible. As for the use of foreign exchange by foreign merchants, a certain Supervisory Committee member said in a solemn tone: "It can be said that there is absolutely no discrimination against foreign merchants in our country's foreign exchange policy today." If individual units are considered, the amount of foreign exchange applied for by foreign merchants is often greater than that of Chinese business circles. However, our country's foreign exchange is limited, so not everyone can be satisfied. This situation should be pointed out to correct international perceptions. The investigation of Yangtze and Fuzhong will be combined into one report, rather than preparing a separate report.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council and University Presidents Express Their Opinions on Wedemeyer's Statement; US President Expresses Concern and Asks the Consul General in Shanghai to Forward the Message</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city news] After Special Envoy Wedemeyer's statement on the difficulties in China was released, the presidents of eight universities in this city, including St. John's, Shanghai University, Soochow University, Aurora University, and Datong University, jointly sent a telegram to US President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and other authorities on August 31, expressing their position on the educational sector. On September 5, leaders of seventeen industrial and commercial groups, including the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Banking, Finance, and Textile Industries, jointly sent a telegram to the US authorities, expressing their opinions from their own perspectives. The US Consul General in Shanghai, Davis, has successively received telegrams from the US President, instructing him to convey to the eight universities and seventeen groups that the US government attaches great importance to the opinions expressed after receiving the telegrams. The full text of the US Consul General's two messages is translated below: "(Titles omitted)" The statement jointly sent to President Truman and other US officials by your society and sixteen other groups on September 5 has been received. I am now instructed by the government of my country to assure you, on behalf of President Truman and other officials, that great attention is paid to the opinions in the statement, and that separate replies have been sent to the sixteen other groups who signed the statement. Davis, September 19 (The letter to the presidents of the eight universities is similar in meaning, so it is omitted).</p>
<h3>Prohibition Involves Too Many People; A Reasonable Solution Should Be Sought</h3>
<p>[Another Telegram] In addition to investigating the use of foreign exchange, the four Supervisory Committee members, including He Hanwen, were also ordered to investigate the "June 7th Project." It is also heard that while in Shanghai, they also investigated some of the current social problems in Shanghai and will submit proposals. According to Committee Member Wang Guanwu, the most concerning social phenomena in Shanghai are: (1) The gap between the rich and the poor is too wide. The extravagant spend hundreds of millions without hesitation, while the poor live a subhuman life whose suffering is unimaginable. Although they have no complaints against the country, the result of the evolution is enough to affect social harmony. (2) Shanghai's population is too dense and the air is polluted. Methods should be developed to disperse the population. (3) Refugees from northern Jiangsu, western Anhui, and southern Shandong gather in Shanghai, numbering in the hundreds of thousands, which is enough to stimulate prices. Good policies should be sought. (4) Although the ban on dancing is a government order, it involves too many people and cannot be completely eliminated in a short period of time. A reasonable solution should be sought.</p>

<h3>Xinjiang Incident Will Not Expand; The People All Aspire to Peace; Government Committee Member Bao Erhan Arrives in Nanjing for the First Time to Talk</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Government Committee Member Bao Erhan flew to Nanjing at 4:00 pm on the 21st, accompanied by Yi Min, Director of the Xinjiang Provincial Department of Construction. Zhang Zhizhong, Yu Dawei, and many others went to greet him. Bao looked energetic and happy. After getting off the plane, he said to Yu Dawei, "It's been ten years since we last met," and then got into a car to his residence. Bao came this time to take office as a government committee member. When reporters asked why he had come to Nanjing to take office so late, he said, "Since I was appointed as a member of the National Government, I have been preparing to come to Nanjing, but I asked for a three-month leave due to illness, and it was not until today that I was able to make the trip." Bao is scheduled to visit President Chiang on the 22nd to report on the political situation in Xinjiang and make suggestions to the government based on his observations. On the evening of the 22nd, Zhang Zhizhong hosted a banquet at his residence to welcome him and introduce him to the government committee members and key government officials. Bao is a Tatar. This trip is his first time in Nanjing.</p>
<p>When reporters asked Bao Erhan about the recent developments in the Xinjiang incident, he said, "My opinion is similar to that of Director Zhang Zhizhong. I believe that if it can be resolved peacefully, there will be no problem. As for Yining's response to Director Zhang, it is because the responsible persons in Yining have gone to the Tianshan Mountains for summer vacation. Currently, transportation between Yining and Dihua is normal. I firmly believe that the incident will not worsen. If they return to Yining, there will definitely be a possibility of continuing negotiations. The people of Xinjiang still very much desire peace. To seek stability in the borderlands, Xinjiang must be made Chinese territory forever." According to Bao's entourage, Bao studied in Germany in his early years and was a classmate of Yu Dawei. He can read German, Russian, and Chinese. He had previously translated the Three Principles of the People from Chinese into Uighur to introduce the true meaning of the Three Principles of the People to the people of Xinjiang. He is currently writing a dictionary that translates between Russian, Uighur, and Chinese, which is about to be completed and is planned to be published in Nanjing. This will be a great help in promoting cultural exchange between Uighurs and Han Chinese. Bao said that within an hour of their arrival in Nanjing, they felt that the environment was beautiful and very suitable for writing. Bao then introduced Yi Min, the director of the Department of Construction who came with him. Yi cannot speak Mandarin and was translated. He said that the purpose of this trip was to solve the livelihood of the people of Xinjiang, because Xinjiang is an economically backward borderland. Currently, he is starting to make suggestions, starting with water conservancy, agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, and transportation. Last year, a five-year plan was drafted, but it has not yet been fully completed. There are two reasons for this: (1) Economic difficulties; (2) Lack of talent. With regard to the former, the National Government has allocated 5 billion new currency (equivalent to 25 billion legal currency). It has now been decided to use 2 billion to develop agriculture and animal husbandry, 1 billion to establish an iron and steel factory, and the remaining 2 billion to purchase machinery and recruit talent.</p>
<h3>Xinjiang Provincial Iron and Steel Factory to Be Completed in Two Months, Says Yi Min, Director of the Department of Construction</h3>
<p>The iron and steel factory is scheduled to be completed in two months, after which it can produce ten tons of iron per day. Regarding the issue of talent, the National Government has approved the dispatch of various talents to Xinjiang. Director Yi Min came to Nanjing this time to invite technicians to go there. Thirty people are needed in the construction sector and twelve in the health department. Finally, Yi hopes that the funds provided by the National Government next year will be increased again.</p>
<h3>Scope of Freedom of Speech to Be Broadened; Publication Law to Be Amended; Draft Has Been Finalized and Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Approval</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] As constitutional government is approaching, the scope of freedom of speech will be further broadened. The current Publication Law was amended in July of the 26th year of the Republic of China and is no longer in line with the current political environment. The relevant authorities have decided to amend it. The Ministries of Interior, Judicial Administration, Foreign Affairs, and Propaganda have repeatedly consulted on this matter and drafted an amendment to the Publication Law, which has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and will soon be submitted to the Executive Yuan for discussion. It is reported that some of the main provisions of the draft amendment to the Publication Law are very different from the current Publication Law. The important ones are as follows:</p>
<p>Regulations on the Publication of Publications by Foreigners in Our Country | The current Publication Law does not have any regulations on this. The draft amendment adds a separate article in Chapter 1, General Provisions, stipulating that "Foreigners may apply for the publication of publications in accordance with the provisions of this Law and comply with all laws and regulations of China regarding publications. However, if the publication laws of the foreigner's home country discriminate against the people of China, they shall not enjoy the treatment granted by this Law." Simplification of Registration Procedures | The draft amendment stipulates that the deadline for provincial and municipal governments to approve registration and for internal authorities to issue registration certificates is "within ten days" (the original stipulation was "within twenty-eight days"). The original method of "copying the registration application form to the Central Propaganda Department for registration" is cancelled, but the draft amendment adds "Purpose of Publication" to the items that should be stated in the registration application form.</p>
<p>Reduction of Government Interference | The draft amendment deletes all articles in the current Publication Law regarding the interference of the competent government authorities in publishers. A total of two articles are deleted: Article 12, "If a newspaper is engaged in the business of publishing news dispatches, the local competent government authority may, when necessary, send personnel to inspect its social affairs group and distribution status." Article 20, "Political leaflets or slogans may not be printed or distributed without the permission of the local competent government authority."</p>
<p>Changes in Restrictions on Matters to Be Published | A total of three points are changed in the draft amendment: (1) Article 21, the original text was "Publications may not contain the following statements or propaganda: 1. Intending to undermine the Kuomintang or violate the Three Principles of the People. 2. Intending to subvert the National Government or harm the interests of the Republic of China. 3. Intending to disrupt public order." It is amended to: "Publications may not contain the following statements or propaganda: 1. Intending to subvert the government or endanger the Republic of China. 2. Harming diplomatic relations. 3. Intending to harm public interests or disrupt social order." (2) The draft amendment adds the following two articles: 1. "Publications may not contain statements that harm the reputation of the heads of state of our country or friendly countries." 2. "Publications may not contain statements that harm the reputation or credit of others." 3. The original Article 23: "Publications may not publish debates on prohibited public litigation cases." The draft amendment adds: "Publications may not criticize events that are in the process of litigation."</p>
<p>Amendment of Punishment Methods | A total of three points are amended in the draft amendment: (1) The original Article 34 stipulates that "If the statements in a publication, in addition to violating the provisions of the Criminal Law, shall be handled in accordance with the law, and if they violate the provisions of Article 22 and the circumstances are more serious, the Ministry of Interior or the local competent government authority may, after submitting to the Ministry of Interior for approval, prohibit its sale and distribution, and may seize it when necessary." The draft amendment changes it to "and may seize it when necessary, or impose a fine of up to 10,000 yuan." The original text of the same article was "If the publication in the preceding paragraph is a newspaper or magazine, its publication may be suspended for a period of time." It is amended to "If the publication in the preceding paragraph is a newspaper or magazine, its publication may be suspended for a period of time for the first offense, and its publication may be permanently suspended for the second offense." (2) The amount of fines for publishers and editors, originally stipulated as no more than 100 yuan, 30 yuan, and 20 yuan, is changed to no more than 5,000 yuan, 1,000 yuan, and more than ten times but less than one hundred times the price of the publication. (3) All eleven articles in Chapter 6, Penal Provisions, of the current Publication Law are deleted. The draft amendment only adds one article at the end of Chapter 5: "If the provisions of this Law are violated, in addition to the penalties imposed in accordance with the preceding articles, if the crimes stipulated in the Criminal Law are violated, they shall be handled in accordance with the Criminal Law, but the publisher, editor, author, and printer shall be treated as accomplices."</p>
<p>After the above amendments, the current Publication Law, which has seven chapters and fifty-four articles, has been reduced to six chapters and forty-six articles.</p>

<h3>Liu Weichi Talks About Overseas Chinese Universal Suffrage, Adopting the Free Election Method, The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is Negotiating with Opposing Countries</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Regarding the issue of overseas Chinese participating in universal suffrage, this reporter asked Liu Weichi, chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, who came to Shanghai for official business, on the 21st. He said: The countries in North and South America are holding friendly attitudes towards our overseas Chinese compatriots participating in universal suffrage, so the universal suffrage of overseas Chinese in those countries can be carried out as scheduled and in an orderly manner. It is regrettable that some countries in Southeast Asia oppose this move, which is obviously unaware of the truth. At present, the hope of our government is that the governments of these countries can understand the intention of our move and give us the same friendly assistance as the countries in North and South America. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently negotiating with the opposing countries, hoping that this wish will eventually be realized. However, if those countries still do not understand, then our country can only adopt other methods to remedy the situation, because overseas Chinese compatriots should be treated the same as domestic compatriots, which has always been the consistent policy of our government, and their civil rights should be effectively guaranteed. As for what method will be adopted for the universal suffrage of overseas Chinese, Liu said: The Minqing parties recently expressed the hope that political parties would nominate for the universal suffrage of overseas Chinese, but overseas Chinese in various places hope to exercise their free will, so it has been decided to adopt the method of free election for the universal suffrage of overseas Chinese.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>An Appeal for the Global Situation!</h3>
<p>The Second United Nations General Assembly opened at Lake Success in New York. In less than a week, the representatives of the United States and the Soviet Union delivered speeches one after another, sharply contradicting each other. This not only caused waves on Lake Success but also made the growing trend of the world dividing into two major blocs even clearer. French Foreign Minister Georges Bidault, who took it upon himself to bridge the gap between the Anglo-American and Soviet blocs, also expressed despair about the success of the United Nations. He said, "The conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly acute, and the situation is very serious; it seems impossible to promote compromise between the two sides." Judging from these few words of Foreign Minister Bidault, it is clear that the current global situation is almost like "the mountain is about to be stormed by winds from the approaching rain." Those of us who have suffered the scourge of two world wars should rise up and appeal to the great politicians for the sake of the global situation.</p>
<p>Before the opening of the Second United Nations General Assembly, people had long anticipated the difficulties ahead, believing that the diplomatic war between the United States and the Soviet Union might inevitably "come to a showdown" in the meeting place. After the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, U.S. Secretary of State General Marshall, in order to strive for the success of the United Nations, first launched a diplomatic offensive. In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, in addition to advocating strict restrictions on the exercise of the veto power, he formally proposed to the Assembly the establishment of a 55-nation standing committee, which would meet regularly to specifically study issues concerning peace and security. At the same time, he pointed out that there are seven major issues that urgently need to be resolved: the veto power issue; the issue of increasing the power of the General Assembly; the Korean issue; the Greek civil war issue; the atomic energy issue; the disarmament issue; and the Palestinian issue. Secretary of State Marshall's series of speeches not only acknowledged the failure of the Security Council but also marked the first shot in the United States' diplomatic war against the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Soviet representative Andrei Vyshinsky delivered a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on the 18th. The sharpness of the wording was far beyond our expectations, and international etiquette and diplomatic language were almost completely disregarded. He bluntly pointed out that Secretary of State Marshall's proposal violated the provisions of the United Nations Charter. The main points of his speech can be summarized as follows: The United Kingdom and the United States are implementing political measures outside the United Nations framework, disregarding the interests of the United Nations. This policy threatens the existence of the United Nations; Among all the activities of the United Nations, the most unsuccessful is the prolonged delay in the disarmament issue, and the United Kingdom and the United States, which have no intention of disarming, should be held responsible; The Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe are far from the principles of the United Nations. The United States is attempting to adopt a dictatorial policy toward other countries; The United Kingdom and the United States are attempting to utilize Germany's heavy industry, and especially want to make the Ruhr region the economic base of the United States in Europe; The United Nations should take action regarding the presence of British troops in Greece and Transjordan, the presence of American troops in China, Argentina's non-compliance with the United Nations resolution on the Spanish question, and South Africa's failure to submit a trusteeship agreement for Southwest Africa; The Indonesian incident can only be described as an act of aggression; The Iranian issue should not be included in the Security Council's agenda; The accusations against Greece's northern border neighbors are without factual basis; Marshall's submission of the Korean issue to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion violates the declaration on the Korean issue that was previously agreed upon by the foreign ministers of the three nations in Moscow; He opposes Marshall's proposal to establish a 55-nation standing committee, pointing out that its purpose is to circumvent the Security Council. In his speech, Undersecretary Vyshinsky even unceremoniously placed the label of "war-mongers" on the heads of some American politicians, which naturally aroused the opposition of the American government and public. As House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton said, "The final confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union is inevitable. Today's world must make a choice between two mutually exclusive and irreconcilable philosophies of life as soon as possible. The Soviet Union's open goal is to conquer the world by force, so the United States should maintain its leading position and responsibility in the United Nations at any cost."</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that both the United States and the Soviet Union are tending toward extremes and are indeed on the verge of breaking apart. The outcome of this conference seems to make it possible for the United States and the Soviet Union to go their separate ways. Whether we are considering our own interests or the interests of the entire world, we ultimately feel that the post-war world should be united rather than divided, and that the United States and the Soviet Union should compromise rather than break apart. There are certainly many factors that have caused the current stalemate between the United States and the Soviet Union, but the most important one is that post-war international politicians and diplomats are often blinded by their own interests and cannot use their political wisdom to transcend narrow national concepts and selfish psychology. Totalitarian ideology and power politics are still at play. Whether it is a foreign ministers' conference or a United Nations General Assembly, the great powers are still engaged in empty dreams, not only failing to solve any problems but also deepening the rifts between nations. Therefore, the most important thing to do now is to eliminate the suspicions between the great powers. If the representatives of all countries can speak truthfully and act with sincerity, treat each other with sincerity, and be willing to compromise with each other, and if everyone prioritizes world peace, then the United Nations will not be afraid of failure, and the existence or abolition of the veto power will not be a major issue at all. In short, at this point in time, the world has reached a stage of division or unity, and the United Nations is also at a critical juncture of success or failure. We hope that the politicians of all countries will appeal to the conscience of mankind when discussing current international issues. We believe that the inherent conscience of mankind will be able to overcome any divisions and obstacles in current international issues.</p>
<h3>New Measures in Postal Service</h3>
<p>At a time when administrative efficiency is generally low, we find the daily progress of China's postal service particularly commendable. The postal service in our country has always adopted a policy of "supporting the postal service with the postal service." Before the War of Resistance, prices were stable, and it was able to be self-sufficient. However, during the War of Resistance, prices soared, but the increase in postal rates lagged behind prices. Recently, the government has also stopped subsidizing state-owned enterprises, so it is not difficult to imagine the economic difficulties of the postal service. However, despite the economic difficulties of the postal service, innovative measures continue to emerge, which is truly worthy of praise.</p>
<p>The Directorate General of Posts works day and night, and the various branch offices have no holidays. If it is inconvenient for citizens who live far from the post office to travel, there are mobile post offices that drive by on time. As long as they wait by the roadside, they can send letters or remit money. In terms of delivery, it has become even faster since the implementation of the district numbering system. At the same time, a campaign to eliminate "dead letters" has been launched. Therefore, the postal service in Shanghai today can truly be described as "stable," "cheap," and "fast."</p>
<p>This rare achievement in the postal service is not only praised by public opinion but also cherished by the people. Facts are the best publicity, so there is no need for us to say more. However, recently, as the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, the postal authorities have issued a special order prohibiting postmen from soliciting "festival money" and encouraging people to report such incidents in order to change customs and habits. This enlightened measure deserves our support even more.</p>
<p>The postal authorities are not only doing their best to improve the postal service so that it fully serves the people but also want to further change the social atmosphere. Its significance is particularly significant. We hope that citizens will work together to help, and we hope that other public utilities will respond to this call.</p>

<h3>UN General Assembly to Discuss Holy Land Issue; British Cabinet Agrees on Countermeasures; Mandate over the Area May Be Relinquished; Willing to Consider New UN Proposals</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 21st – The extent to which British troops in Palestine will withdraw or be reduced will depend on the outcome of the UN General Assembly's discussion of the Palestine issue.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York, 21st – US Congressman Martin expressed his views today, stating: A consensus among the majority of nations in the UN on the Palestine issue could lead to an early resolution of one of the most difficult problems in the world. He hoped that a resolution could be reached soon, as the issue has been delayed for too long, causing significant suffering to both Jewish and Arab peoples.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] Britain has decided that unless the United Nations can soon propose a viable plan for Palestine, Britain will relinquish its mandate over the Holy Land and withdraw its troops stationed there. Reliable sources believe that although a special meeting of the British Cabinet has decided on the principle of troop withdrawal, any new proposals put forward by the UN will still be considered by the British government. Today's special cabinet meeting was the first time that the entire cabinet discussed the proposals of the UN Special Committee on Palestine. Prime Minister Attlee convened this meeting for two reasons: one, to obtain cabinet members' opposition to the majority and minority proposals of the UN Special Committee; two, to decide on the position that the British delegation to the UN General Assembly should take during next week's debate on the Palestine issue. Colonial Secretary Creech Jones rushed back to London from the West Indies Conference in Jamaica to attend, and he will travel to New York to personally present Britain's views on the Palestine issue to the UN General Assembly. It is understood that the main points of discussion at today's special meeting of the British Cabinet included: Acknowledging that the UN is unlikely to come up with a solution for Palestine at this stage that Britain can implement alone or with the assistance of other countries; Acknowledging that the continued presence of 100,000 British troops in the Holy Land is contrary to Britain's principle of disarmament to replenish the workforce needed for economic recovery and industry; Although British troops are stationed in the Holy Land, the situation there continues to deteriorate, making it impossible to maintain the area in a dangerous state.</p>
<h3>Austin Delivers Speech; Rebuts Vyshinsky's Views; Denies US Plotting War Against USSR</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 20th] The United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Warren Austin, delivered a speech tonight at the United Nations Association of the United States, criticizing the speech delivered by Soviet Representative Vyshinsky at the United Nations General Assembly the other day.</p>
<p>It is said that this kind of speech, with its wanton accusations and absolute slander of the United States' motives, and defamation of individuals and groups, has dismayed the majority of Americans who firmly believe in the Soviet Union's peaceful intentions. This kind of speech may be effective for the Soviet people, frightening them and making them believe that the United States intends to attack the Soviet Union by force. But in the United States, the opposite is true. The American government and people firmly adhere to the principles and policies of the United Nations, regardless of external provocations. We do not believe that Mr. Vyshinsky intends to damage our country's honor. The United States still believes that peace is the unanimous goal of all countries and peoples. We believe that those who follow the Soviet Union have impure motives and are prone to hatred and war, rather than affection and peace. On the contrary, we have guaranteed our full support to the United Nations, hoping to spare our children and grandchildren from the ravages of war, because the United Nations is an instrument of peace.</p>
<h3>Lie Urges Major Powers to Coordinate</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 24th] United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie delivered a speech tonight at the United Nations Association of the United States, criticizing the major powers for their responsibility in the world organization's stalemate. He said that the world is aware that the United Nations is facing a serious test, and that the differences between the major powers are clearly responsible for this. Heated debates on these differences have now begun in the United Nations General Assembly, and the people of the world are frightened and uneasy to see the major powers who led the establishment of the United Nations now clearly confronting each other. Lie's remarks seem to be indirectly urging the major powers to coordinate their differences.</p>
<h3>US Submits Application for Italian Membership to Security Council</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 20th] The United States formally proposed tonight that the Security Council re-discuss the issue of admitting Italy to the United Nations at its next meeting. Italy's application was previously vetoed due to Soviet opposition, which argued that no action could be taken until the peace treaty came into effect. Now that the Italian peace treaty came into effect on Monday, this obstacle has been removed. News from Moscow suggests that the Soviet Union may be prepared to vote in favor of Italy's membership, but only if the Security Council also approves the admission of Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 20th] Finland officially applied to join the United Nations as a member today. The Allied peace treaty with Finland was ratified and came into effect a few days ago.</p>
<h3>Stimson Does Not Believe Soviet Union Wants War; Argues US Should Maintain Strong Military Power</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 21st] Former US Secretary of War Henry Stimson delivered a speech here today, expressing his strong belief that no Soviet politician or citizen truly wants war. But at the same time, he argued that the United States should maintain a strong military power to prevent the possibility of Soviet leaders resorting to war when forced to do so. Stimson said, "Regardless of the theoretical basis of Soviet policy, we believe that at least some Soviet leaders are serious about facts rather than illusions. I served as Secretary of War during the isolationist era and again during a period of courageous and generous action. I have experienced the adverse effects of restricted action and the vast power of full action. I know that the United States is capable of coping. We should immediately tell the Soviet Union that a non-aggressive Soviet Union need not fear us, and we should also make it clear that the non-communist countries of the West must survive in economic and political stability. If we do so, the Soviet leaders will gradually change their minds."</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Arrives in Paris to Preside Over Final Meeting of European Economic Conference; Unlikely to Attend UN General Assembly in US</h3>

<h3>Remnants of Japanese Troops Cause Trouble in Indonesia; Specialize in Killing Indonesians and Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[United Press, Medan, Sumatra, 20th] Well-informed sources in the Dutch and Indonesian communities said today that an independent guerrilla team is waging a small-scale war against Indonesian and Dutch troops in northern Sumatra. The guerrilla team is known as the "Wild Tigers," and they kidnap, rob, and kill thousands of Indonesians and overseas Chinese.

<h3>All Professional Dancers in Shanghai: Petition Madame Chiang Kai-shek: Hoping for Reconsideration on the Dance Ban</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Since the central government's ban on dancing order reached this city, dance industry workers have become increasingly panicked. It is reported that the dance industry union has decided to convene another general meeting at New Sen Lin at 10:00 AM on the 23rd, and after the meeting, petition the Municipal Council to request that the council consider the special circumstances of this city when discussing this proposal and extend the deadline appropriately. Furthermore, the dancers in this city feel that the dance ban deadline is imminent, so they specially launched a collective signature campaign and submitted a letter to Madame Chiang Kai-shek. The full text is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>"Your Excellency Madame Chiang: This time, the government has decided to ban dancing in order to vigorously promote frugality. Although we, as weak women, use dancing as our profession and have shallow knowledge, we also know how to love ourselves and our country. We are determined to abandon extravagance and practice frugality. However, in order to struggle against hunger and prolong our ant-like lives, we dare to offer our sincerity regarding the prohibition of commercial dancing, and respectfully request that Your Excellency act as a patron. In our opinion, commercial dancing itself is not extravagant; those who consider it extravagant are using the convenience of dance halls to engage in the sale of other luxury goods or luxury-related supplementary businesses. If the goal is frugality, it is sufficient to abolish the aforementioned luxury goods sales or luxury-related supplementary businesses to achieve the goal. Moreover, all dance halls have already automatically stopped selling various foreign wines and expensive drinks to cooperate with the authorities' frugality efforts and only offer tea and music for people's entertainment. Since there is no violation of frugality, there is no need to ban it. It is like restaurants and automobiles; only limiting luxury dishes or limiting the use of excessive gasoline is the target of frugality, and the operation of restaurants or the use of automobiles are not fundamentally prohibited. Although the nature is different, the meaning is the same. Moreover, there are already more than 5,000 of us who are only dancers, and countless others, directly and indirectly, rely on this for a living. Once their livelihoods are cut off, the resulting tragedy will be indescribable. Among us professional dancers, there are those who have lost their parents in childhood, are lonely and destitute, those who are young widows with mouths to feed, those whose parents are disabled and cannot work, or those whose parents are unemployed and have no means of support. Although their backgrounds are different, their suffering is the same. All of them use their dancing income to support their families. Who does not have parents, and forget shame? Who is a daughter, and willingly make a career in holding? Who can bear to have their unclean bodies and minds be despised by others? However, driven by life, they have to force a smile to cover the pain in their hearts and earn a living. Every time they think of their tragic experiences and miserable fates, they cannot help but cover their faces and weep. How can they have the heart to pursue luxury, be intoxicated, and live extravagantly? The family burden of professional dancers is already heavy, so there is no need for government supervision. They are striving for frugality at all times and in all places. Even if there are a few who forget their roots, they should not be seen as the whole. If the government only sees dancing as extravagance and does not understand the hardships of dancers' lives and suddenly bans it, it will not only cut off the livelihoods of our weak women but also leave the majority of related personnel with no way to survive. Because in the short term, there are neither opportunities for career change nor the ability to change careers. The ending of their tragic fate will inevitably lead to becoming a scourge of society, and the harm will be ten or a hundred times greater than dancing. This is definitely not the goal of the authorities banning dancing for the sake of frugality. Therefore, we dare to make this appeal with tears and respectfully request Your Excellency to show the virtue of God's love for life and pity the dying lives of weak women. Please turn to the government authorities and make a national suggestion to reconsider the ban on dancing so as not to let thousands of people be cut off from their livelihoods and all means of survival. With respect and fear, we await your order. The entire body of Shanghai's Allied Dance Women."</p>
<h3>Please Eat Government-Priced Mooncakes</h3>
<p>The Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching in the blink of an eye, and food stores are competing to make mooncakes for the market. The prices are exorbitant, which is staggering. It is reported that the municipal government, in order to cooperate with the frugal consumption movement, believes that mooncakes are non-essential consumer goods and should be restricted. It is currently drafting measures to set mandatory prices for Mid-Autumn Festival mooncakes.</p>
<h3>China Tanker Company Hosts Guests to Tour the Yong Hong Tanker: Oil Tanks Composed of Multiple Isolated Units: Equipped with Steam and Other Equipment to Prevent Fires</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The China Tanker Company's Class A tanker, Yong Hong No. 201, has recently been repaired and specially invited guests to visit yesterday. Chairman Weng Wenhao also attended in person. The only thing that set this reception apart from the rest was the strict prohibition of smoking.</p>
<p>The Yong Hong was manufactured by the American Northwest Bridge and Iron Company in 1921. The ship is 481 feet 2 inches long, 60 feet wide, and has a speed of 10 nautical miles per hour. It has a gross tonnage of 8,206 tons and a deadweight of 11,900 tons. The ship has a total of 18 oil tanks and 10 side ballast tanks.</p>

<h3>Following Li Ze: New New Company's Acting General Manager: Xiao Zongjun Accused of Aiding the Enemy: Investing in Building Ships and Selling them for Enemy Military Use</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The case of Li Ze, General Manager of the New New Company, being accused of being a traitor is still in the High Court for retrial. Unexpectedly, one wave has not subsided, and another has risen. Xiao Zongjun, the acting general manager of the company, has also been accused of communicating with and aiding the enemy. He was summoned for questioning some time ago, but Xiao claimed to be ill and did not appear in court. His lawyer filed a petition for postponement. It is rumored that the details of the case are quite complicated. The main points of the accusation are as follows: Xiao is from Guangdong, 42 years old, and the brother-in-law of the economic traitor Shen Changqing. During the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, Xiao and his cousin Xiao Xichang used the strong financial resources of the Longchang Shipyard, Xingren Enterprise Company, Xingren Real Estate Company, and China Industrial Bank, and also used the financial power of his wife's brother, Shen Changgeng, to invest in building ships and selling them to the enemy army for the enemy's military material transportation. More than 20 enemy ships were funded one after another, one of which was built exclusively by Xiao's private investment and sold to the puppet Anhui Provincial Government, specifically for the transportation agency jointly established by the puppet government and the enemy military liaison department.</p>
<p>At that time, it coincided with the period when Luo Junqiang and Lin Baisheng were in charge, so a part of the ship price could not be settled. Xiao repeatedly entrusted Ye Xuesong, Cai Meishun, and Li Weiqi to negotiate and collect the money. All the officials during the tenure of Luo and Lin, as well as senior employees in companies such as Longchang and Xingren, knew about this process. A little investigation can prove it. At the same time, there are ledgers of Longchang, Xingren, and Xiao himself, as well as bank and money house checks of each company, which can be thoroughly investigated. Also, during the enemy-puppet period, Xiao colluded with Cai Yichengren, an important member of the enemy's military intelligence agency, and the enemy chief Major General Yoshino. When Xiao secretly went to Hong Kong and Guangdong, he brought a large number of valuable Western medicines to ingratiate himself with the enemy chief. After returning to Shanghai, he was ordered to purchase a large amount of food and military supplies and transport them to Guangzhou to aid the enemy. The person in charge of this matter in Guangzhou was Sha Ji Liang Qiuji. An investigation will reveal the truth. The judicial authorities believe that the case is quite serious and are paying close attention to it. They will conduct a thorough investigation and expect surprising developments in the coming days.</p>
<h3>New Generator Installed in Pudong: Power Generation Increases by 2,000 Kilowatts</h3>
<p>The Pudong Electric Company has installed a new mobile generator that can generate 2,300 kilowatts at night and 2,000 kilowatts during the day. However, the highest efficiency has not been achieved due to some cooling equipment that still needs to be improved. The generator was officially put into operation on the company's second anniversary of its resumption of business the other day. Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, was invited to visit and delivered a speech to all employees, stating: "Each power generation company in this city is currently operating independently due to regional relationships. However, the power supply in this city must have a comprehensive plan for unified allocation. I sincerely hope that the company will be broad-minded and participate in the joint electric company organization to implement this plan."</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Driver Killed Under the Wheels: Jeep Causes Accident and Flees: Found Based on Paint Marks: Romanian Driver Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] At around 0:25 AM yesterday morning, a rickshaw puller, Wang Zhongxing (from Funing, 25 years old), was driving past the entrance of No. 134 Weihaiwei Road and Tongfu Road when he was suddenly hit by an American military jeep. The rickshaw was destroyed, and the driver died. At the time, the American soldier responsible for the accident drove away at full speed to escape punishment. Afterwards, the Xincheng Police Sub-bureau, after being notified, urgently ordered team leader Gu Qiwen and Shui Quan and others to lead officers to investigate. As a result, broken traces were found on the red paint behind the rickshaw. Based on this, officers were dispatched to investigate several locations, including the Racecourse, Jiangwan, and the Broadway Building. At 3:00 AM, the Jeep card (identified as National Shanghai 1456) that caused the accident was found inside the American Military Resistance to Japan Storage Office in the Racecourse. It was determined that the front bumper was stained with red paint, and the driver was identified as a Romanian named George. He was arrested at No. 2, Lane 339, Linsen Middle Road and taken to the police station for interrogation. The body of the rickshaw driver who was killed was sent to the Changde Road autopsy room to await the District Prosecutor's Office to send personnel for examination.</p>
<h3>Rapid Oil Tanker Transportation</h3>
<p>The difference between the structure of an oil tanker and an ordinary transport ship is that the oil tank is composed of several compartments. Oil loading and unloading is done using oil pumps, which is extremely fast and safe. Because the ship's hold is composed of multiple compartments, even if there is danger during navigation, the ship can still maintain buoyancy under normal circumstances and will not sink.</p>
<p>As for the main fire-fighting equipment of an oil tanker, each oil tank and side tank has a steam pipe connected to the boiler room. In the event of a fire, steam is put into each oil tank where the fire is to remove the air inside the tank, thereby reducing the oxygen in the air and extinguishing the fire. In addition, there are fire hoses and foam fire extinguishers installed on the deck and in necessary places to prevent fires in various parts of the deck.</p>
<h3>Opening of Long-Distance Shipping Routes</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the company: After the China Tanker Company was established in February of this year, it began to receive oil tankers. However, most of the oil tankers received needed to be repaired, especially the Class A tankers, which were severely damaged. They were actively repaired while simultaneously being put into operation. The 16 Class B tankers were repaired long ago and are sailing in inland rivers and along the coast. After the Class A Yong Hong ship is repaired, it will open up long-distance shipping routes, sailing to Iran to load crude oil. If the first trial voyage is successful, then the remaining three Class A ships will continue to operate on long-distance routes in order to increase the import of crude oil. In total, from February to July, the company was entrusted by the China Petroleum Corporation and foreign companies such as Asiatic Petroleum, Socony-Vacuum, and Texaco to transport 94,000 tons of gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and fuel oil from Shanghai and Taiwan to Nanjing, Hankou, Qingdao, and Tianjin.</p>
<h3>A Record of Obtaining Treasure from a Mine: The Owner Talks About the Discovery of the Giant Diamond: Like a Page of a Twisted Legendary Tale</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Since the news that a rare diamond was stored in the safety deposit box of a certain bank in this city spread, all parties have paid close attention to it. People from the United States are even more interested in this matter, and they have been inquiring with this newspaper about the truth and price every day. Because the owner of the diamond, Mr. Li, is currently in Taiwan, this newspaper specially cabled our reporter stationed in Taiwan to conduct an on-site interview. We have now received a detailed report. Mr. Li personally recounted his experience, which is like a page of a twisted and confusing legend. According to Mr. Li, "I am from Anhui Province and am a businessman. I went to Singapore to make a living in 1938. When the Pacific War broke out in 1941, I fled to Sumatra and took refuge in a small village called Donggang. I raised chickens and ducks and lived a hard life. I occasionally did small transactions with the local Malay aborigines, which gradually made me familiar with the aborigines and others."</p>
<p>Miner Finds Stone in Deep Mountains</p>
<p>He claimed, "There was a certain temple person in Donggang who was a miner. Thirteen years ago, while transporting a stone in a deep mountain mine, he suddenly found a rattling sound inside the stone. After opening it, he found this crystal clear stone, shaped like a goose egg, with a layer of rough film on the outside. Driven by curiosity, the aborigine planned to split the stone with an axe. Unexpectedly, the stone was very hard, and only a small piece was cut off (the photo taken on the 16th of this newspaper is the missing part on the front). Later, because he could not break it, he stored it at home."</p>
<p>Bought for 700 Dutch Guilders</p>
<p>Later, because I had been living with the aborigines for a long time, I occasionally heard about this from them. As a result, after much bargaining, I bought it for 700 Dutch guilders. In September 1945, I was falsely accused of being a political suspect by the Japanese invaders and detained in a concentration camp in Jambi. I was not released until October of the following year. Before being arrested, I had buried the stone and other important items in a cigarette can under a tree near my residence. After being released, I returned to the area, dug it up, and took it to Singapore. In 1946, I returned to Shanghai and stayed in Nanjing and Shanghai for a week before going to Taiwan to take a job."</p>
<p>Sent to the United States for Research</p>
<p>Mr. Li claimed: "When I was in Nanjing and Shanghai, I did ask friends to find ways to test it everywhere, and some friends even sent the crushed stone to the United States for research, but there has been no formal response. Some said it was a gem, others said it was quartz, but some people also believed that it was indeed a diamond. After coming to Taiwan, I gave one of the pieces that had been crushed by the aborigines to Dr. So-and-so, a professor at National Cheng Kung University, to ask him to test it. It has been more than a month, and there is still no definite conclusion."</p>
<h3>Emits Pale Green Light at Night</h3>
<p>This reporter then asked about the details of the diamond. According to Mrs. Li (from Ningbo), the stone is completely transparent. If it is placed in the hand and slightly tilted, it has a very strong reflection. When placed in water, it is as if there is nothing there. In a dark place at night, it emits a pale green light. It can crack a thick glass cup when used. The report says that it weighs 400 carats. She replied that it has not been weighed by a machine that calculates carats, but only weighed by a Chinese market scale, which weighs a total of 4 taels and 5 qian.</p>

<h3>Post-War Reconstruction Advancement Association Issues Opinions on the Peace Conference</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the China Post-War Reconstruction Advancement Association yesterday issued the following opinions on the Japanese peace conference: 1. Prerequisites for the Japanese Peace Conference: The holding of the Japanese peace conference should be based on the principle that all Allied countries participating in the war against Japan should participate. If one country does not participate, the significance of the peace conference will be lost. The highest principle of the Japanese peace treaty should be based on the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Treaty. The Japanese Emperor is a feudal idol of the Japanese nation and the original main force in launching aggression. He should be listed as a war criminal before the peace conference and put on trial. 2. Matters needing attention in the Japanese peace treaty: The level of Japanese industry should not exceed the current situation in China. In the Japanese compensation, our country should receive 50% of the total. As for the items originally plundered from our country by Japan, they should be regarded as returns and not included in the compensation amount. Compensation goods should be mainly industrial equipment, not its products. The treaty should stipulate that after the signing of the treaty, the four major powers, the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union, should continue to occupy Japan for 20 years. The Ryukyu Islands and the Penghu Islands originally belonged to China and should be clearly stipulated in the treaty to be returned to China. 3. Issues regarding the resumption of Japanese commerce: Commerce with Japan should adopt a policy of protecting domestic trade. All domestic products should be restricted or prohibited from import. Materials used in industrial production should be allowed to be imported. Prevent any form of smuggling. Establish a specialized organization for Japanese commerce to handle and study all plans and implementations regarding commerce with Japan.</p>
<h3>Seeking Peace, Yet Not Peaceful - A Full-Scale Brawl at the Sanduo Bathhouse</h3>
<p>The Sanduo Bathhouse at No. 14, Qunyu Lane, West Road, was opened by Qian Xianchu after the victory, employing dozens of war workers, and the business was not bad. On the 13th of this month, it happened to be the 30th day of the seventh lunar month. Workers Ma Qingyong, Jiang Guolin, Wu Zhengmou, and Zhu Liangsheng initiated a collection to hold a Taiping Gong Jiao (offering to the gods for peace). Each worker at the bathhouse donated 10,000 yuan, the foreman donated 30,000 yuan, and the bathhouse owner donated 200,000 yuan, totaling 1 million yuan for the expenses. That evening, Taoist priests were hired to hold a ceremony. At that time, several workers, including Zhu Shiben, Wang Guiyuan, and Lu Zhusan, expressed their unwillingness to participate, but because the majority agreed, they could not refuse. However, they were very dissatisfied in their hearts and expressed complaints. Around 11:50 the night before last, the bathhouse was closing, and while they were cleaning up, Zhu and others questioned Ma Qingyong and others, demanding to see the accounts. Disagreement led to a mutual fight. Dozens of workers nearby, each according to their closeness, stepped forward and joined the melee. The owner of the bathhouse learned of this and reported it to the local police station, which dispatched officers to suppress the situation and took the troublemakers to the station for investigation. As a result, manager Qian Xianting, workers Wu Zhengmou, Zhu Liangsheng, Wang Guiyuan, and Ma Qingyong were all injured and went to the hospital for bandaging. During the fight, the bathhouse equipment was damaged, including a piece of glass in the Victory Hall door on the second floor, a piece of glass on a coffee table in the Peace Hall on the second floor, three pieces of glass in doors and windows, and a rectangular purse containing 3.58 million yuan in cash was lost, with a total value of approximately 15 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Through Deng Hanxiang, a Glimpse into Sichuan Politics</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, 16th] Sichuan Province has a remarkable figure, and that is Deng Hanxiang. From the time General Liu Fucheng presided over Sichuan's administration until General Deng Xihou truly assumed the chairmanship of Sichuan Province, a full twelve years, he almost solely held the position of Secretary-General of the Provincial Government.</p>
<p>It is certainly no easy feat for a Guizhou native to achieve such prominence in Sichuan. In his early years, he graduated from the Baoding Military Academy and was a true military talent. Recalling his experience, the mere fact that he served as Secretary-General to General Duan Qirui is enough to frighten younger generations. After General Duan Qirui stepped down, he lived in seclusion in Beiping. Coincidentally, General Liu Fucheng sent a representative, Ji Zuyou, there. In the eyes of Northerners, Sichuanese and Guizhou people are like fellow villagers. Deng Hanxiang fulfilled his role as host and warmly entertained Ji Zuyou.</p>
<h3>Secretary-General of the Sichuan Provincial Government</h3>
<p>Recent photo of Deng Hanxiang (Sent by Special Correspondent Ouyang Chun)</p>
<p>When Ji Zuyou returned to Chengdu, General Liu Fucheng asked him about his observations during his trip to the north. He strongly recommended Deng Mingjie to General Liu, saying, "Deng Mingjie is a great talent." When General Liu invited Deng Hanxiang to Chengdu for a visit, he wanted to offer Deng a few lucrative tax positions as a reward. However, Deng politely declined. General Liu Fucheng then felt that "this Mr. Deng is indeed an upright person." Later, without Deng Hanxiang's consideration, he was appointed as Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, while Liu himself focused on military affairs. Today, although General Liu Fucheng has passed away for nearly eight years, his</p>
<p>military power</p>
<p>cannot be underestimated. This is due in no small part to Deng Hanxiang, who served as Secretary-General for several terms. He prevented General Liu from worrying about political matters. He established a strong formation for the Sichuan political situation.</p>
<p>In 1936, he presided over the Sichuan Provincial County Government Personnel Training Class and various cadre training classes in Chengdu (including: financial training, social training, teacher training, water conservancy training, prohibition training, and Baojia cadre training classes). The County Cadre Class was held for three sessions, graduating more than 1,020 students. That is why most of the current county magistrates, section chiefs, secretaries, bureau chiefs, division chiefs, and a small number of commissioners in Sichuan call Deng Hanxiang "teacher." However, what is surprising is that the more than 900</p>
<p>County Training Students</p>
<p>(several dozen have died) scattered throughout Sichuan still do not have a clear organization to this day. The social relationships of the various cadre training classes are even more complex, with more than 10,000 people participating in the training. The various cadre training classes once had an organization called the "Graduate Investigation Office of Various Cadre Training Classes." During the tenure of General Liu Fucheng, General Wang Zanxu, and General He Guoguang, they received subsidies. This situation continued until General Zhang Yuejun concurrently served as Chairman of Sichuan Province before it was cancelled.</p>
<p>Mr. Deng Hanxiang is tall and strong, with bright eyes. He loves to wear Chinese clothing all year round. He is calm and unruffled and is sixty-one years old this year. It is said that he has "never held grudges" in his life. To "not hold grudges" while living in a complex political vortex certainly requires a superior skill. When General Liu Fucheng passed away and General Wang Zanxu acted as Chairman, Deng Hanxiang's position as Secretary-General remained unshaken. However, when the order for General Wang to truly assume the chairmanship was published in the newspaper, an</p>
<p>unexpected event</p>
<p>occurred. The resourceful Deng Hanxiang and General Wang Zanxu had an unpredictable conflict. He angrily left Chengdu and came to Chongqing, where General Zhang Yuejun was serving as Director of the Chongqing Xingyuan (Provisional Headquarters) and invited him to be Director of the Second Office of the Xingyuan.</p>
<p>He did not feel wronged in Chongqing for long. In the middle of 1940, one day, military police were added to every street in the city, and soldiers with live ammunition from the suburbs were attempting to pour into the city from the surrounding counties. The situation was extremely urgent. Deng Hanxiang flew back to Chengdu. As a result, General Wang Jixu volunteered to go to Sichuan to fight the enemy, and Chairman Jiang concurrently served as Chairman of Sichuan, in the capacity of the head of the country. However, it was not until General Zhang Yuejun, in his capacity as Director of the Chairman's Chengdu Xingyuan, concurrently served as head of Sichuan's administration that Deng Hanxiang</p>
<p>stepped back into</p>
<p>the door of the Provincial Government. From Director of the Finance Department, concurrently serving as General Manager of the Sichuan Provincial Bank, and then concurrently serving as Director of the Sichuan Provincial Land Tax Administration Office, all the way to today's Secretary-General. How many people have fallen, yet he still stands firmly.</p>
<p>If anyone is concerned about and speculates on the Sichuan political situation, the first figure they cannot ignore is him: Deng Hanxiang. [Special Correspondent Ouyang Chun]</p>

<h3>Manufacturing Plant Disease and Insecticides - Chengdu Chemist Promoted from Trainee to People's Factory Director</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chengdu, 18th] Zhou Delong, director of the Plant Disease and Insecticide Demonstration Factory of the Sichuan Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute, is a young chemist. After graduating from the Department of Chemistry of Wuhan University in 1937, he came to Rong to work as a trainee at the factory. He has risen through the ranks of technician and section chief to become the current factory director. New members of the Chengdu New Establishment visited the factory and praised him as a "people's director." Unlike general administrative heads who only handle formal documents such as "in accordance with instructions," anyone who visits him will always find him working hard in the laboratory. His full beard and torn work pants often make first-time visitors doubt whether he is the director. The pharmaceutical factory has been established for a total of eight years. When it was first established, it was difficult to promote business. The provincial government distributed various insecticidal drugs to villages free of charge. When farmers believed in the effectiveness of the drugs and purchased them automatically, a slight cost price was charged. Especially in tobacco-producing areas such as Shiqi, Jintang, Nanxi, and Yibin, commissioners are sent every year to purchase bactericides. Director Zhou told reporters: The factory has indirectly increased rural production. Mr. Zhou is currently writing a book on agricultural chemistry. With his ten years of practical work experience, it can be predicted that this will be a valuable scientific reader. (Chun)</p>
<h3>Huaihe River Swimming Bandits - Stab Boatmen to Death</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Bengbu, 19th] Swimming bandits have been discovered in the He Xia area, appearing on the water surface at night and taking the opportunity to stab boatmen to death. At 2:00 AM on the 19th, four swimming bandits wearing rubber suits suddenly emerged from the water surface of Xin Chuantang and climbed onto the transportation boat of boatman Xiao Zhenfa.

In addition, two workers named Zhu and Mei were also injured at the same time. Zhu was stabbed four times in the calf, and Mei was stabbed once in the right thigh.

<h3>Preparing to Add Tidal-Watching Special Trains on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 20th] The Jiang'an area of Toutou on the south bank of the Qiantang River has collapsed, and the tide has shifted southward, so there is no longer a large tide to watch along the Jiangning River on the north bank.

In the first half, Barnet scored two goals, and Sing Tao scored one goal. In the second half, Barnet scored three more goals, and Sing Tao scored two more goals. Sing Tao's Feng Jingxiang scored two goals, and Cao Qiuting scored one goal.</p>

<h3>The Textile Industry Association Continues to Hold Its General Membership Meeting; Public Associations in Various Districts Report on Their Work</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The second general membership meeting of the Joint Textile Association was held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Chairman Liu Jingji, along with representatives from the Textile Industry Association and public associations in various districts, gave detailed reports on their work. First, Wu Meijing, representing the Textile Industry Association, reported on the association's work over the past two years, stating that the motivations for the association's establishment were: 1. To plan for the takeover of Japanese-owned yarn mills; 2. To plan for the dismantling of Japanese-owned yarn mill equipment after the victory; 3. To plan for the takeover of the [missing] Japanese goods market before the war; 4. To cooperate with the government's five-year industrial construction plan. The work completed after the establishment was: 1. Cooperating with the Forestry Department to send cotton [seeds] to Zhengzhou after the victory; 2. Investigating cotton production nationwide; 3. Investigating and compiling statistics on rear-area yarn mills and yarn mills nationwide, with the latter work still to be completed; 4. Establishing textile industry associations in various districts; 5. Raising funds for an independent cotton industry; 6. Purchasing a [address] for the Textile Industry Association on Di [missing] Road, Jing'an Temple Road; 7. The issue of the number of National Assembly and Legislative Yuan seats remains to be resolved.</p>
<p>Next, representatives from the cotton spinning industry associations in various districts reported on their work. First, Shi Fengxiang, representing the Second District, reported on the difficult situation of the factories in Shaanxi during the war.</p>
<p>Luo Yangzhi, representing the Third District, reported on the situation of the yarn industry in the Kunming area, stating that there was a local need for coarse cloth, and the factories were all spinning 10-count yarn, but the supply of raw materials was extremely inadequate. The work efficiency of the workers was low, and wages were low. However, the electricity supply was abundant, and all the factories' spindles were running.</p>
<p>The Northeast Yarn Industry Faces Many Difficulties</p>
<p>Xi Yu[missing], representing the Sixth District, reported on the situation of the textile factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces and the cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, listing figures to prove the rapid recovery. However, this has caused Shanghai to feel a shortage of electricity, which has not yet been resolved. The supply of fuel is also a difficult problem. The workers' problems and the overall situation are still satisfactory. The most urgent issue to be discussed at present is the reasonable setting of yarn prices, otherwise the yarn mills will not be able to resume production smoothly. It is unreasonable to suppress yarn prices while raw material and labor costs are rising.</p>
<p>Yang Yizhou, representing the Seventh District, reported on the situation in the Tianjin area, stating that state-owned yarn mills accounted for approximately 80% of the area, with the remainder being privately owned. After the establishment of the association, it negotiated with the tax bureau to reduce and exempt taxes and resolved the labor unrest problems in various factories. This year's cotton [missing] is one-third more than last year, but transportation is blocked. A proposal was made to the conference to study the plan of using the Executive Yuan Air Transport Brigade to transport cotton. In addition, the northern region was occupied by the enemy for the longest time, and the yarn mills suffered the greatest losses. It is hoped that the government will give special consideration and support.</p>
<p>The representative of the Ninth District reported on the yarn industry in Qingdao and Shandong, stating that there are more than 30 yarn mills in the area, concentrated in the two cities of Qingdao and Jinan. Due to the CCP's occupation, both cities are like isolated islands, so there are many difficulties. It is hoped that the central government can [missing] more cotton loans to purchase raw cotton. In addition, the quota for coal is too small and must be improved. The metal materials required by the yarn mills are usually purchased from Tianjin and Shanghai, which is also difficult. Wages have increased by an average of 80,000 times compared to before the war, but there are still many labor disputes.</p>
<p>Finally, the representative of the Northeast District reported that during the enemy and puppet era, the Northeast yarn mills had 540,000 spindles and 10,000 looms, but now, due to various reasons, only 100,000 spindles and 5,000 looms can operate. In terms of raw cotton, the cotton fields are all located in southern Liaoning, and today's production is only one-third of that in the enemy and puppet era. The Japanese used various means to force the promotion of cotton fields, reaching up to 700,000 mu. Today, the price of food is higher than the price of cotton, and farmers have switched to growing food crops, resulting in a sharp decrease in the area of cotton fields. This year's maximum cotton production is 200,000 dan. In the future, the [missing] release of cotton goods and the promotion of cotton fields are important issues. The supply of coal in the Northeast is also insufficient. In terms of electricity, since the CCP's five offensives, the Xiaoman power has been cut off, and the yarn mills were shut down for a month at that time. The electricity currently used is the excess electricity from the factories of the Resources Commission, which is only one-third of the past electricity volume. Therefore, if there is no development in the military, the future of the yarn industry is extremely difficult. After the representatives of various districts finished reporting, the secretariat reported that it had received congratulatory telegrams from all parties and 72 proposals. The general assembly declaration was passed, and Dong [missing] Zhang Wu Meijing Wang Qiyu and others were elected as seven drafting committee members. The general assembly [missing] and the meeting was dispersed at midnight.</p>
<p>The Main Proposals Have Been Reviewed</p>
<p>The subcommittee meeting continued at 3:00 PM in the afternoon to review the proposals, and the important proposals at that time were reviewed. The main ones included: 1. Taiwan's [missing] coal has been overproduced and measures should be taken to improve its supply to the mainland. 2. In the future, when establishing new factories, the government should strictly designate areas. 3. The yarn mills in the southwest and northwest suffered heavy losses during the War of Resistance and the government should give preferential treatment. 4. The number of representatives of the yarn industry should be increased to four, and the number of legislative members should be increased to two. 5. The transport of raw cotton should be assisted by the Executive Yuan Air Transport Brigade. 6. It is difficult to obtain machine parts at home and abroad and a factory should be set up domestically to manufacture them. 7. After the war, textile technology has advanced in various countries and a study delegation should be sent abroad for investigation.</p>
<p>The Shipping Industry Union Hosts a Banquet for the Representatives</p>
<p>At 7:00 PM in the evening, the Shipping Industry Union hosted a banquet for all the representatives at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Du Yuesheng, Shu [missing], Xu Xueyu and others successively delivered [speeches], all strongly [emphasizing] that the textile industry and the shipping industry are two key industries for our country's national economy and people's livelihood. Especially today, when we are striving for the Nanyang market, we cannot earn foreign exchange without cloth, and we will not be able to compete with the powerful enemy Japan without local [missing] shipping. Therefore, the joint struggle of the two industries is necessary. The general assembly will continue this morning to pass the proposals, and the meeting will be closed after the election in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Kerosene Supply Is Scarce and Prices Are High</h3>
<p>Although China-America Petroleum Company has been supplying kerosene to the market recently, the quantity is small. The market demand is strong, and the supply is still insufficient. The opening price continues to rise. Recently, the price of high-grade barrel oil has risen to 1.723 million yuan for sale. Mobil's cans are traded among peers at 210,000 to 15,000 yuan, and transactions have been made. The market price is 4,500 yuan per can, and 5,000 yuan per full jin, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Industrial Association Hosted the Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial Association hosted reporters from various newspapers at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 21st). Tian Heqing reported on the association's limited quota of raw materials distributed by weaving.</p>
<h3>The Food Industry Requests Exemption from Business Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Merchants Association, Grain Merchants Association, and Bran Industry Association stated that the central government's continued exemption of business tax for the food industry for one year will expire at the end of September. Now, due to the endless civil strife in various places, [missing] back, traffic jams, [missing] food supply is affected by the world food shortage and has not been smooth. The market associations and grain merchant groups of seven provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, previously went to Beijing to petition the authorities, but were not approved. They are now launching a second expanded petition. The association decided to take a consistent step. As the fourth general assembly of the Municipal Council is scheduled to open today (the 22nd), it specially submitted the proposal to the council yesterday, requesting that it be discussed at this general assembly. It also sincerely appealed to the central and municipal authorities to approve the restoration of the exemption of business tax on food.</p>

<h3>New Medicine and New Drugs, Edited by Shanghai Medical Association, My Views on the Nanjing Municipal Hospital Incident</h3>
<p>— 幵里</p>
<p>The Nanjing Municipal Hospital surgeon, Qian Ming, because of his loyalty to his duties and his wholehearted service to patients, was actually accused of professional negligence and sentenced to imprisonment. This unfortunate news fills us scientific medical practitioners with extreme indignation! I previously read the eulogy by Mr. Liang Junqing in this publication, and recently I praised the declaration of our Medical Association. I deeply feel that the injustice and depression in my chest caused by this case have been fully vented on our behalf. However, there are still a few points that have not been mentioned, which seem to stick in my throat, and I have to express them quickly. Therefore, without considering my own clumsiness, I will borrow a corner of this publication to discuss this case with those who care about it.</p>
<p>First, according to hospital practice, before surgery, a consent form must be signed by the patient's family or responsible relatives, stating that in the event of any unforeseen circumstances during or after the surgery, there will be no objection. This kind of consent form should have absolute legal effect. Now, let us put aside all the academic disputes related to this case for the moment. If the patient's family has indeed signed a consent form, and complications still arise afterward, it is tantamount to the patient's family going back on their word and betraying their trust, and they should bear the primary responsibility for this. How can the facts be erased, and the doctor involved be blamed for the crime? I sincerely do not know if, at the beginning of this case, before Dr. Qian performed the surgery, the patient's family went through the procedure of signing a surgical consent form? Because the distance between Nanjing and Shanghai is quite far, and inquiry is not easy, for a moment there is no way to guess. It is possible that Dr. Qian was innocently implicated, and the patient's family's going back on their word and betraying their trust is also related. Second, accidents during anesthesia that lead to death are medically termed anesthesia death. Since the advent of anesthesia, various medical literatures at home and abroad have detailed records of this, and it is by no means a unique case created by Nanjing Municipal Hospital. According to current research, the causes of this kind of anesthesia death are no more than two: poisoning and shock. Poisoning is caused by excessive dosage, and of course there will be toxic phenomena, which can be proven in the corpse. Shock is entirely due to physical constitution, especially in constitutions like thymic-lymphatic constitution, which are most prone to anesthesia death, but this can also be proven in the corpse. Now, if we want to investigate why the patient operated on at Nanjing Municipal Hospital had an accident, if the corpse is dissected, it will not be difficult to find out the truth. It is regrettable that this was not considered during the forensic examination! Third, judges value freedom of conviction, and losing impartiality and fairness by following others' opinions. But in fact, what is allowed for free selection is limited to the scope of etiquette, customs, and human emotions. If they encounter problems related to science, and disregard the principles of contemporary knowledge and insight, arbitrarily influencing decisions will inevitably lead to endless jokes. For example, modern scientists have proven that the earth is spherical. If legal references are needed, the theory of a round earth should naturally be followed. It is not possible to change the theory of a spherical earth just because the ancients had the theory of a flat earth! The medical issues involved are of course a kind of science. Taking anesthesia as an example, the anesthetic drugs used during anesthesia fundamentally have the distinction between general anesthesia and local anesthesia. General anesthetics act on the central nervous system, such as ether and chloroform. Local anesthetics act on the peripheral nerves, such as cocaine and procaine. Although these two types of drugs have the same anesthetic properties, the pharmacology of each drug is different. Not only can the properties of ether and chloroform not be confused with the properties of cocaine and procaine, but there is also a great distance between ether and chloroform, and between cocaine and procaine. For example, the side effects of ether are less stimulation to the heart and more stimulation to the respiratory system. The side effects of chloroform are more stimulation to the heart and less stimulation to the respiratory system, which happen to be opposite properties. Also, cocaine's side effects can excite the medulla oblongata and constrict blood vessels, so it can indirectly affect respiration and the heart. However, procaine has no effect on the medulla oblongata or blood vessels, standing in opposition to cocaine. Therefore, if someone wants to judge the advantages and disadvantages of anesthetics, they must carefully understand the personality of anesthetic drugs. If they speak in general terms, they will inevitably point east and say west, resulting in contradictions with scientific principles. I always feel that these elements have been incorporated into the case of Dr. Qian's implication.</p>
<p>Fourth, I also read the public notice from all the doctors of Nanjing Municipal Hospital, which included an excerpt from the judgment, stating, "The above-mentioned anesthetic is only applicable to those with normal heart, lung, kidney, and nerves, and especially not suitable for those with heart disease." I don't know if there was a typo? Judging by the literal meaning, it seems to be quoting a medical theorem. Now, in order to find this theorem, I have searched through all the reference books at hand, whether pharmacology, surgery, surgical textbooks, or surgical manuals, and I cannot find any similar clause. Especially the word "kidney," I don't know what it refers to? Thinking about it from the perspective of pathology that I have studied before, I cannot imagine what deep relationship procaine has with the urinary system that must be avoided. To put it more broadly, those with abnormal kidney function most often exhibit arteriosclerosis. Even if patients with arteriosclerosis need anesthesia surgery, there is no need to hesitate too much. Of course, like cocaine, which constricts blood vessels and increases blood pressure, but for the purpose of anesthesia, the time is fixed and the dosage is limited. Even if it is used, it will not cause danger. Other anesthetics that have no stimulating effect on blood vessels at all have no need to be avoided, so I still think this kidney word is a typo.</p>
<h3>Trauma Can Worsen Old Illnesses</h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>In summary, a 53-year-old man who had never been ill before suffered an external injury on November 26th of last year, with his chest heavily impacted against a hard surface. After entering the hospital, he seemed to have recovered, but suddenly vomited blood and had a slight fever. Twenty-four days after the injury, he had irregular fever, and on the thirty-ninth and fortieth nights after the injury, he had severe chills and high fever. On an X-ray taken sixty days after the injury, a clear onset of miliary tuberculosis could be identified. However, an X-ray taken ten days after the injury showed no signs of anything that could potentially develop into miliary tuberculosis. A photo taken twenty-six days after the injury only showed a suspicious congestion phenomenon. The patient died eighty-six days after the injury.</p>
<p>The patient's body was dissected, confirming miliary tuberculosis and indicating that it was caused by a sudden recurrence of a dormant old tuberculosis lesion due to the injury.</p>
<p>Reasons: The starting point of the miliary tuberculosis was the calcified lesion in the hilum of the lung, especially the calcified lesion in the lower lobe of the right lung was more obvious. The distribution of lymph nodes was very wide and peculiar, also in a miliary state (all of the above are based on the autopsy report). This can prove that the deterioration is consistent with the clinical symptoms of chills and high fever. There was a fibrous adhesion state the size of a silver dollar on the fifth rib near the heart on the right lung, which was a sign of adhesion between the pleura and the lung, that is, where local pleuritis (Pleuritis epifocalis) had occurred. The healing condition here was very thick, with a lot of connective tissue, which was undoubtedly an old tuberculosis lesion. There were several obvious hemorrhagic reactions nearby. This was of course because he had vomited blood not long ago. The early tuberculosis lesions of pneumonia had long been calcified, which could be said to be completely unrelated to the occurrence of miliary tuberculosis. His hemoptysis had nothing to do with the old lesions, because according to the autopsy, the old lesions had no cavities or caseation, and it could be said that hemoptysis would never occur. On the contrary, his hemoptysis can be determined to be related to the injury. According to the autopsy, we can determine that he had pleuritis, and the adhesion site was damaged and bled due to external impact. Because the adhesion site in the lower lobe of the right lung was not easy to move when injured (the unadhered part could of course move), bleeding and tissue damage occurred. As a result, tuberculosis bacteria entered the blood vessels from the old lesions and evolved into acute miliary tuberculosis. (Detailed in the Swiss Medical Weekly, No. 24, 1947, written by Prof. Lofler)</p>
<p>According to the above records, we can know that a dormant, and can be said to be cured, disease suddenly worsens in a certain accidental situation (i.e., trauma), especially dormant tuberculosis is more prone to this change. (Loffler has described another case, but it is not recorded due to length).</p>
<p>Therefore, my belief has changed, and there are so many unexpected accidents in the world. Isn't it? I once read a piece of news in the newspaper that one person jokingly punched another person, hitting him in the upper left abdomen. As a result, the person fell to the ground and died. The autopsy revealed that the deceased had malaria before his death, and his spleen was abnormally enlarged. He died from rupture of the spleen and bleeding due to the blow.</p>
<p>If he had never been punched in his life, then he might have lived to be seventy or eighty years old, but this blow was his fatal injury, ending his entire life.</p>
<p>Therefore, I say that trauma can worsen old illnesses. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Looking Forward to the Future Scientific World</h3>
<p>— Gang Ren</p>
<p>Will the power of atomic energy eventually end the era of coal and oil and replace them? Many scientists already believe that it is just a matter of time. There are many organizations in the world, under the leadership and cooperation of many excellent scientists, working hard in this area. The Americans, with their vast resources, are eager to get ahead of others and are building great power plants in Hanford and Oak Ridge to replace the 7,100 gallons of gasoline and 38.5 tons of coal consumed every hour today.</p>
<p>Here, the biggest difficulty lies in how to isolate the dangerous radiation. Scientists are concentrating all their efforts on finding a material that is more solid, lighter, and more effective than lead and concrete. Perhaps a new plan for reflecting and concentrating those rays instead of absorbing radiation energy with the laborious old method, like lead sheets.</p>
<p>Because there is no lightweight atomic energy barrier, atomic energy can at most only be used as a power plant, train, or unmanned aircraft.</p>
<p>No one knows yet whether atomic energy is more economical than the current power. In any case, this is not only good news for areas without coal and oil production, but it will also solve the increasingly severe coal shortage problem, allowing tomorrow's aircraft to circle the earth several times without refueling.</p>
<p>Therefore, mankind will never use the old clumsy method of putting an internal combustion engine on a four-wheeled carriage, that is, forcing it to suit modern machinery. Possibly, atomic energy can be directly converted into electricity without going through that most inefficient thermal cycle. Dr. J.A. Hutchson of Westinghouse Research Laboratory pointed out that the method of using the battery effect of injecting electricity into metal sheets may be a new one.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our atomic energy now comes from splitting heavy atoms, using the heaviest raw materials, uranium-235 and second-class tin; while the ancestor of atomic energy, stars, at least the sun, its radiant light comes from the combination of oxygen into helium. This was the method that Germany was desperately researching during the war and was destroyed by the Allied countries. If humans can achieve this in the future, then atomic energy will be even more convenient and inexhaustible. This may have hope of success under the efforts of the cosmic ray research work in the United States and the atomic energy research institute in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The future power world has an infinitely beautiful future.</p>
<p>The progress and reform of aircraft design will enable mankind to achieve the ability to control the speed driven by explosive force, to exceed the speed of sound, and to achieve the goal of space navigation.</p>
<p>On Earth, the Arctic navigation research in Alaska in the United States will use improved aircraft to go to lands that no one has ever been to and develop those rich resources.</p>
<p>In the new developments in broadcasting, even more brilliant prospects can be seen. Because the sky is very wide, enough for our radio waves to travel back and forth.</p>
<p>Won't it be too far? Wireless telephones, televisions, and ultra-shortwave networks are covering the world, and many broadcasts, telephone communications, telegrams, telephoto transmission, and movies are being transmitted silently.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion of Metals</h3>
<p>— You Ding</p>
<p>There are many types of metals, but there is no one that is omnipotent and sufficient for human application in all aspects. Aircraft engineering requires a metal that is as strong as steel, as light as wood, as resistant to corrosion as gold, and also easy to melt, press, and pull. Fishermen want metals that sink well, while light bulb manufacturers want a metal that does not melt at a temperature of 10,000 degrees Celsius. Looking at this, we know that it is impossible to have an omnipotent metal that can meet the needs of any aspect. Now, let's briefly discuss several kinds of metals.</p>
<p>Lead—Everyone knows that lead does not rust and can withstand hundreds of years of climate change and wind and frost. Lead tubes can be used to contain sulfuric acid because 75% concentrated sulfuric acid cannot dissolve it. However, in micro-instruments, sulfuric acid can be advanced from 90% to 100% concentration, and this concentrated acid can immediately dissolve lead. In dilute acid, the surface of lead is covered by a thin layer of lead sulfate, and lead sulfate is insoluble in water, so the lead sheet can be prevented from being dissolved. Lead cylinders and lead containers are mostly used to hold dilute sulfuric acid.</p>
<p>Aluminum—Aluminum is not afraid of sulfuric acid or nitric acid, but it is afraid of strong bases. Aluminum nitride usually does not react with acids, so it can be used as a fine saucepan. The chemical industry uses aluminum to contain acids but not bases. The density of aluminum is 2.7, and its weight is like glass shards. It is generally believed that aluminum is very light, which is because it is compared with other (other metals. Most metals are 6.5 to 11 times heavier than water. But if compared with plastics, wood, and ordinary fluids, aluminum is a bit too heavy.</p>
<p>Magnesium—Magnesium is just the opposite of aluminum. It is not afraid of tests. In the test, magnesium is wrapped in a layer of hydrated magnesium, and it is isolated from water and hydrogen. Strong bases that can dissolve strong metals such as platinum cannot touch magnesium, but it is often corroded by weak acids such as fruit acid or plant acid. Although magnesium is afraid of acids, there is one strange thing, that is, magnesium is not afraid of highly corrosive concentrated hydrofluoric acid. This is because magnesium fluoride is insoluble in hydrofluoric acid. The density of magnesium is 1.74, which is a little heavier than the heaviest wood, but much lighter than aluminum. Magnesium is a good metal, coarse, hard, strong, and resistant to corrosion; and, in some situations, magnesium is the only dominant metal, unmatched by other metals.</p>
<p>Lithium—Lithium is the lightest of all metals and can float on gasoline; but unfortunately, lithium is a very pampered and delicate daughter. It dissolves almost as soon as it sees oxides or hydrides. It is the most active metal, and it corrodes almost as soon as it comes into contact with humid air. Lithium and its companions sodium, potassium, and rubidium are really light and so soft that they can be kneaded with both hands or two fingers.</p>
<p>Beryllium—The density of beryllium is 1.85, slightly heavier than magnesium. Although it is light, it is as hard as steel. Its melting point is very high, like heavy metals such as steel; it has strong corrosion resistance. However, beryllium also has its shortcomings. Its pure beryllium or most beryllium alloys are hard and brittle, and beryllium is difficult to extract from its attached ore, and the reserves are not concentrated.</p>
<p>Others—Iridium can resist all chemical attacks, unlike other metals that require special conditions to resist corrosion. The density of iron is eight, and it is not soluble in concentrated sulfuric acid because it is covered by insoluble iron sulfate. Caesium and Stromtium are cousins of beryllium, extremely active and fragile, and have no use at present. Although platinum is the most resistant to erosion, it is still afraid of sooty names, because soot is carbon, and platinum can react with carbon in some way. Also, sodium carbonate cannot be dissolved in platinum crucibles, otherwise sodium carbonate will dissolve platinum.</p>
<h3>Submarine Long-Range Ears</h3>
<p>— Zhao Nan</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy invented a deep-sea long-range ear during the war, named Sofar. If translated into Shanghainese, it means "Listen Far." This kind of submarine long-range ear uses the principle of sound transmission and the geometric triangular calculation method to be able to measure distant ships in distress, downed airplanes, and isolated and helpless lifeboats. When the driver encounters danger, they simply drop a depth charge into the sea. The bomb will automatically explode when it sinks to 4,000 feet, thus generating a huge explosion sound, which can make the submarine long-range ears within 3,000 miles work, thereby determining the location of the accident. This measurement is very accurate, with an error of less than one mile.</p>
<h3>New Wood Products</h3>
<p>— Tang Yao</p>
<p>Thermoplastic: In 1941, when conducting the above-mentioned chemical drying test, a wood drying expert at the U.S. Forest Products Laboratory accidentally immersed a 1/4-inch standard wood in a concentrated urea solution. When heated to 212 degrees Fahrenheit, the wood piece became as soft as leather and could be bent and twisted arbitrarily. When the wood cooled, the shape of the bend could be kept unchanged. Mr. Luo also used a layered saw test, which could also be flattened and pasted into a thin plate by itself. After further research, three types of urea-heated molding wood (Uralloy A.B.C) have been manufactured. Therefore, this new property of wood, which was accidentally discovered, has opened a new era in wood utilization.</p>
<p>Compreg: The U.S. manufacturing of compressed wood originally came from the research on preventing the expansion and contraction of wood. Mr. Stamm injected several kinds of synthetic resins into the wood; when heating (Heat-ancreasin Process), the wood was found to be in a plastic state that was soft and bendable and could be subjected to pressure to make it shrink. He used light wood, and when it was compressed to 1/3 of its original volume, its strength could be compared to soft steel. After detailed research, this technology can be applied to ordinary wood and molded to Destined Shape; or use bonded wood (that is, already sliced into thin sheets and glued into layers) to make the required size and shape, and take and demand according to the strength. Compressed wood is water-resistant and resistant to erosion by alcohol and mild acids. It has been used in the manufacture of aircraft propellers. It is said that a company in Michigan, USA, uses this method to mold propeller tail wheels and struts. Although the manufacturing cost is not expensive in heavy affairs; but it seems that it is still to be studied to reduce its cost for general construction. However, it is possible to mold industrial gears, pulleys, etc.</p>
<p>Staypak: The latest product of refined wood invented by the U.S. Forest Products Laboratory in recent years. Its advantage is that no synthetic resin is needed during the compression and heating process, so it can be regarded as an improved compressed wood. According to the U.S. Wood Products magazine in January 1945, the manufacturing technology is mainly to avoid the re-expansion of wood after compression when it encounters water. Mr. Si is well versed in the principle and technology of preventing wood from expanding and contracting. He believes that if the wood material that binds the cell walls of the wood body can be used during the processing period to make it fluid, it is possible to prevent the generation of stress on the cell walls. However, although this situation can be achieved at high temperatures, the wood is also scorched at the same time. Therefore, the focus of the technology is to solve the problem of reducing the temperature at which the dual wood material is in a fluid state. After multiple tests, it was found that "water" can promote the fluidity of wood material and is a very good plasticizer, so the manufacturing technology was solved. When manufacturing compressed and shrunk wood, the moisture content must be larger than that of compressed wood. If it is compressed to the appropriate time at a relatively high temperature, the wood can be compressed to a specific gravity of 1.6 or 1.4. The wood used is usually 1 1/2 times thicker than the body, or thin wood (Veneers) that has been bonded into layers with synthetic resin; therefore, no more resin needs to be injected except for the synthetic resin needed to bond the plywood.</p>
<p>The color of compressed and shrunk wood is darker than that of ordinary wood. The compressed surface is smooth after grinding and has a gloss similar to that of compressed wood. It can be cut freely with metal tools. Under the same moisture content and specific gravity, the longitudinal and transverse compressive strength of compressed and shrunk wood is smaller than that of compressed wood; but the longitudinal tensile strength and flexural strength are 25% larger than that of compressed wood. According to records, the tensile strength and flexural strength of compressed and shrunk wood with parallel grains are 40,000-45,000 pounds per square inch, which is about twice that of American yellow cards and three times that of American western spruce. The toughness of compressed and shrunk wood is twice that of compressed wood. After processing, the strength of light poplar and fir wood can exceed that of the strongest commercial wood. The expansion of compressed and shrunk wood in the atmosphere is very slight, but it will gradually weather like ordinary wood; therefore, it does not need to be painted outdoors, unlike compressed wood.</p>
<p>The manufacturing cost of compressed and shrunk wood is lower than that of compressed wood, and the quality is also more tough; it is of great value in the post-war improved small aircraft, as well as the handles, columns, pulleys, silent gears, and other applications that require strong toughness and no deformation.</p>
<p>The above is a brief description of the known refined wood products; however, many new technologies are not detailed due to industrial secrets and cannot be described in detail. However, the transformation of the properties of wood is nothing more than: 1. Making synthetic resins with low molecular weight and affinity for wood form in the fine structure of wood cells, so that water cannot enter or exit; 2. Using the plasticity of the wood material itself. 3. The heat-forming properties of wood after treatment with urea, etc. (that is, the wood can be bent freely when it is hot, and it remains unchanged after cooling). Therefore, the new technology of synthetic resin bonding to wood can be said to have promoted a new revolution in the application of wood by the bitter people. At present, my country's metal industry has not yet been weeded out and developed. How to improve my country's wood and utilize wood chips and other waste materials is what my country's material scientists should urgently eliminate.</p>
<h3>Announcement</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Qian, who introduced the book Pctash, Soda Process in the science book review of the seventh issue of this publication, is the original work of Mr. Zheng Linzhi, published by Shanghai Longmen United Press. Those who are interested are welcome to inquire. We hereby make corrections and express our apologies!</p>
<h3>Chemical Saw</h3>
<p>— Germany</p>
<p>The Stalin Factory in the Soviet city of Gorlovka has recently invented a new method for cutting hard metals. It is a hybrid of electricity and mechanics. The saw used in this method is a smooth, thin disk with a diameter of one foot. The setup of the disk is no different from that of an ordinary saw, rotating at about 2,000 to 3,000 revolutions per minute. It is connected to the positive terminal of a generator, while the metal being cut is connected to the negative terminal. When activated, a special electrolyte is produced in the part being cut. Due to the electric current, chemical decomposition occurs, and the balancing action forces the saw to work. The electric current rapidly separates the metal as it passes through the electrolyte.</p>
<h3>Rocks That Fell From The Moon</h3>
<p>— Liu Dade</p>
<p>Mr. H.H. Nininger believes that Moonstone is not a gemstone, but rather a rock that fell from the moon. He says this type of stone is called Tektite and was broken off from the moon by large and fast meteorites. Mr. Nininger is an American authority on the study of meteorites, so any statement he makes on this subject will attract widespread attention.</p>
<p>It is a fact universally recognized by astronomers that the Earth and other planets in the solar system are constantly bombarded by meteorites. The Earth's surface has a layer of air that protects it from the impact of meteorites. Therefore, when a meteorite rushes towards the Earth at high speed, it will inevitably generate friction as it passes through the atmosphere, thus heating up to a white-hot state and burning up.</p>
<p>The moon, however, is different. Its surface does not have a layer of air, so meteorites can easily reach the moon without burning up. In fact, some astronomers believe that many of the craters on the moon are the result of meteorite impacts.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether we accept this theory or not, the following facts are certain: when a high-speed meteorite strikes the moon, it will generate tremendous heat. When the meteorite collides with the moon, all of this heat will be converted into steam. At this time, a terrifying explosion will follow, and some of the rocks on the moon's surface will be shattered and thrown into the air. These rocks will be immediately melted by the heat generated during the collision. If they fall to Earth, they will become round, glass-like stones called Tektites.</p>
<p>Although most of the rocks thrown out from the moon will fall back, a small portion may still escape the moon's range because the Earth's gravity is greater than the moon's. If a piece of melted rock enters the Earth's gravitational range, it will fall to the ground.</p>
