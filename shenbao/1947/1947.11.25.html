<h3>四強外長會議的展望</h3>
<p>四強外長會議定本日揭幕於倫敦，此一會議之召開緊接整聯合國大會之後，値歐陸動盪不寗之會，自舉世愛好和平人士所關心。外長會議之舉行，本洲源於波茨協定；自大戰結束以來，今番在倫敦舉行的，已是第七次了在過去六次外長會議中，波茨坦協定的精神，似乎未必全能舉，往往因時因地，亂為權宜之計。例如在莫斯科舉行的第次外長會議，參加的只有三強，中法均未出席，其後在馬黎行的，參加的也只有四強；祇有在倫敦召開的第一次外長會，纔是五強外長會議。綜觀過去的成績，歷次所召開的外長議，其成就並不如一般的預期；而列强間意見的參商，轉而乎使外長會議的召開，成為不同意見的極好宜傳塲合。在這多少具有神經戰的意義下，外長會議，似已多少失去其原來意義。</p>
<p>這次在倫敦召開的四強外長會議，是上在巴黎召開的兩次外長會議及紐約和莫斯科召開的外長會議餘緒的。在巴黎所召開的兩次外長會議，雖成立了五國和約案，召開了巴黎和會；但對德奥問題，却未能成立協議。在約召開的第五次外長會議，對德奧問題依舊擱髓，未有成就在莫斯科所召開的第六次外長會議，意見益形紛歧，對於德實際問題，亦未成立具體協議。此次在倫敦召開的外長會議因此，其主要課題，依舊為德奥問題：奧國的獨立問題，和德的和約問題。在對德和約這一個問題上，裏面所包括的還賠償問題，如何使德國經濟復蘇及德國的政治組織問題。倘這些具體的問題不能獲致協議，則對德和約的章製，根本便是夢想。</p>
<p>對德的賠償問題是與德國的經濟復蘇問緊緊地關聯着的。蘇聯要向德國取得一百億美元的賠償，願以工業生產和機械作抵，這是否足以影響德國的經濟復蘇不無問題；四強之所以迄未能成立協議，也就在此。在英美他們認為盟國雖可向德國索取賠償，但必須德國人民先能維自己的生活，不再仰給於國外的救援。倘使不願到德國本身經濟復蘇，強索賠償，是無異於向另一盟國索取賠償。在德的政治組織方面，英美則主張採取聯邦制，而蘇聯却主張中集權。在這些問題上，英美與蘇聯的觀點，其間有着遼遠的離。除非一方不固執成見，具有妥協的精神，欲其能夠成立議，似乎跡近理想。</p>
<p>不用說旁的，在四強外長會議還不會在敦揭幕的時候，新聞社傳來的報道，即已帶有濃厚的悲觀成；即大會的議程，亦未能成立協議；英美法之一方面，及蘇一方面均將各有議程提出。而正在倫敦四強外長會議召開的夕，德境蘇軍總司令索柯洛斯基又在盟國管制會席上，對西國家大肆抨擊。基此種種，倫敦四強外長會議的前途，似乎許樂觀。倘使這次四　外長　　　　　問題，再不能成立協，則東　的鐵　必將下　面成為一　新的長城，所謂兩個世將更有顯露的及現。在事實上，德國的人民也多已準備到這後的決裂。據報傳消息，德國當局估計：如倫敦四強外長會失敗，蘇聯放下錢幕，將有二百萬至三百萬難民，自蘇聯軍領區邊向英美軍佔領區；目下蘇聯軍佔領區與英美軍佔領區加緊邊防。可見此次外長會議如再無成就，對於此後歐洲的局必將有嚴重的影響。我們更不能忘懷的，就是在法義，由最近澎湃的工潮及騷動，亦可能有其反應。</p>
<p>誠如此次倫敦四強外長會議美代表杜雷所云，這眞是一個需要決定的時候，具有決定作用的時候。間在倫敦將作什麼决定，我們惟有看此後的事態發展。從過的經驗來論，每當需要決定的時候，蘇聯可能稍稍改變它的衷，或不如說，蘇聯對於它的觀點可能不堅持太甚，故為延，因此，也可能成立某種協議。此所以本次倫敦四強外長會的成敗，關鍵繫於莫洛托夫一人。但蘇聯的基本立塲，是不變的；一時的延宕，也許正是達成它目的之一種手段。在他倫敦出席外長會議的前夕，在芝加哥外交關係協會席上，美務卿馬歇爾對蘇聯的企圖，會有率真的指陳，最後提到他出此次外長會議的態度。馬卿說：「不問他人如何挑撥，我終設法避免為宣傳而發表聲明。我的目的是在專心一致覓取成協議的基礎，以終止目前的僵局，而加速促成和平的新世紀。此雖或不免為外交官的一種外交辭令，但我們却願此次外會議能在暗礁處處之下，眞能覓取成立協議的基礎，使目前僵局得以終止，題，依舊為德奧問題：奧國獨立問題，和對德的和約問題。</p>

<h3>塔德明乘輪返美　他完成了黃河堵口工程　他半生心血都用在中國</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕聞名全球的「黃河堵口」工程，其設計及主持者塔德總工程師（見國），在過去一年十個月中完成了他生平最偉大的傑作後，將於明（廿六日）乘「戈登將軍」號離華回到他的故鄉—美國加利福尼亞去了。塔氏今年高齡雖已六十有七，可是他的精力依舊像二十多歲的靑年一般，他對於平生所愛好的水利工程，始終沒胡厭倦，他還不想退休養老，這次回去，祗是探望他的家屬。我們一方面要感謝塔德先生對中國的偉大貢獻，一方面仍盼望他再回到他曾經居留過二十年的中國來，因為中國今後需要像塔德先生這樣的人才是太殷切了。</p>
<p>塔德先生第一次來華是在一九一九年，那時他担任運河水利委員會的實地調查工作，直至一九三八年，他的工作因為受到戰章的影響而中止了。在那十九年中，塔氏會週遊一大半的中國，築過許多路，為紅十字會及其他救濟機關舉辦工務設備，並克服了無數次黃河泛濫。</p>
<p>一九四五年十二月，塔氏以聯總總工程師的名義，再度來中國，繼續用他最大的力量，與黃河決口搏門。不顧政治情形的複雜，不怕一次二次的失敗，利用了聯總給與財力物力的幫助，帶領了三十五萬舊發勇敢的工人，向着河南花園口五千呎的缺口衝去，終於在化去三百八十萬人工，五千噸聯總麺粉，二百七十五萬立方公尺的土方，四千三百萬斤高梁梗，一億另五百萬斤的柳枝，六十噸白鉛絲，一千噸土產麻繩，二百五十萬袋聯總沙泥，十五萬立方公尺石塊以及聯總供給的各種機器之後，這五千呎的缺口，被滿滿的塡平了。而最大的力量，還是塔德工程師以及聯總·行總·我國政府及勞苦功高工人們的毅力。</p>
<p>今天，黃河流域二百萬畝的肥活之地方得以重生，中國每年可多獲二百萬噸的食糧，而尤其重要的，是泛區數百萬的同胞，從此不再流離失所了，塔德先生這次的功續，將使我們深深的欽佩，而他愛護中國的熱忱，尤其使我們永遠地感激。我們向他致敬，並祝他歸途順風！</p>
<h3>陳建新黃世民酈伯瑾　判決理由書全文（下）</h3>
<p>而陳建新於獲案後之自白書，亦祥敘新潮社係於民國三十四年上半年成立，被邀參加，其組織無固定形態，依需要情形而增减之，設有社長為陳建近，並兼連絡事務，會計為黃世民，學術出版第鄺伯瑾，在杭州回學由于于三負責連絡，其餘各社友的分佈，南京彭昌祜，李植燕，上海黃世民·陳建新·薛希孟，台灣王俠·趙致康，無錫向協五，常州何大堪，吳興劉逸放等。其在本年十月二十八日之談話筆錄：</p>
<p>陳建新談話筆錄</p>
<p>「問」你的思想自何時起趨向左傾？「答」在農經系一年級讀書時，受了薰陶，思想遂告左傾。「問」新潮社的立塲宗旨何在？「答」是促進民主，硏究農業學術。「問」那麼新潮社的活動處處都集中在政治方面嗎，「答」這因為在我們這個組織裏，有一部分人對政治發生興趣的緣故。「問」政治發生興趣，為什么不客觀一點，採取各方面的資料，而專門搜集左派理論資料？「答」也就因為現在靑年人都感到苦悶的緣故。「問」你們目前的活動，譬如說，散播反動毒素，控制學生自治會代表，難道與你們新潮社的宗旨完全吻合嗎？〔答〕這的確是不對的地方，我們的行動，多少對國家民族是有損害的。「問」現在國家需要安定，社會需要建設，而你們作為國家中堅的大學生，竟在朝向破壞這條路走，你們受的是三民主義的敎育，由政府拿出公費來培養，你們對不對起國家。「答」我們的確對不起國家。「問」新潮社的立塲旣然是不正確，而且是反動的，那他過去的一切活動，倒底是接受那一個黨派的領導？「答」新潮社的各種活動，無形中似乎受共產黨的影響，同時在將來也可能投向共產黨去·「問」這不是如此抽象說法就可以抹煞的，政治活動是一種行動的表現，決不是空泛的想像，你們的活動無形是受着反動黨派的指使，請你坦白的告訴我們·「答」我們的確沒有黨的聯繫，但我們的活動方式與形態，的確完全與共產黨相似。「問」如果新潮社是一個正常的社團，你們為什麼要採取秘密活動的方式，你們的　告，又為什么要顧慮到安全問題？「答」因為無形中我們自己有一種涉懼，我們看的書大都是屬於左派的，我們各種活動的確與共產黨相彷彿，所以也怪不得會引起你們的懷疑。</p>
<p>陳　新於本年十月二七日更有親筆所書之悔過書一紙，內載陳建新自來杭被禁，覺以前行為失撿，思想有誤，自今以後，願改過自新，為國家出力，為民族求榮。</p>
<p>黃世民談話筆錄</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿四日廣播：華盛頓訊，美參院主席范登堡今日離開其外委會主席之座位，首先就美國對泆義奧三國之緊急援助開始辯論，主張國會應迅速核准七億九千五百萬元之緊急撥款，以防共產主義之繼續蔓延。渠謂，在聯合國機構中，新侵略勢力刻正利用否決權力事阻撓，並迫使其附　國亦步亦趨。此在歐洲，各國之少數份子正以怠工及其他不正當活動造成混亂，以謀共產主義之抬頭。</p>
<p>范登堡謂：蘇聯刻正努力使美國之援歐計劃失敗，美國必須急起直追，以求歐洲之穩定，藉使美蘇問之「最後衝突」不致眞正發生。范氏對總統之援歐計劃，力促加速通過，惟對總統以防止通貨膨脹與援歐混爲一談，則表遣應，認爲此點足以在民衆中引起「錯誤之反響」云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿四。廣播：華盛頓訊，美參院撥款委員會今日開會，撿討美國因援歐而在國內糧食問題上所發生之影響。該委會主席勃列奇斯稱，杜魯門總統要求實行配給及管制物價，實屬侵犯國會之權力，並謂總統之緊急援歐計畫，尙係一「空頭支票」。　認爲美國對法，義，奧三國之緊急援助，可能在美國國內引起嚴重之糧食缺乏。據悉，杜魯門已向國會保證一點，即明年美國之農產品收穫如聞欠佳，則運歐之食糧可設法予以减少。</p>

<p>新閣之口號爲不尙空言，迅速行動。共黨「今晚」晚報對於新閣之批評，乃爲犧甡了社會黨，使人民共和黨取得領導地位，戴高樂在政府中之勢力爲之增加。新財長梅逸，固被觀爲戴高樂之信徒者。</p>

<p>〔合衆社羅馬廿三日電〕義共黨在其繼續對政府之作戰中，似乎已將其戰略自街頭流血鬥爭，轉爲要求由義工人控制義大利工業。若干方面稱政治暴動所以終止者，藍其顯然不能威迫政府辭職，更不能造成工人之被大批屠殺而用作宣傳也。</p>

<p>此項危險勢力之存在，麥帥總部之重要官吏已一致同意，其組織較諸戰前反英美之黑龍會，尤爲嚴密廣泛，事寶上等於一種「秘密政府」。衆信此項組織　及日本全國各地，其上有一重要人物統率一切，另有一十人委員會負責推動。此等重要人員，大多來自被整肅之軍人及財閥階級，其下級工作人員遍及各階層。彼等之中心思想，爲極端國家主義。惟欲確定此輩人物之姓名，係一極困難之工作，因其行動詭秘，即圈內人物，亦不知其負資人爲何人。惟在任何人參加此項組織之時，必須立下血誓，此點已爲麥帥總部所確知，其他則尙待調查。在最迸數星期中，已有該組織之會員兩人被捕矣。</p>

<p>經詳細計議後，於當晚八時五十分，由吳月英帶就烟蒂草蓆等火種，潛入火柴盒儲藏室實行放火，董阿翠·王金香·湯小妹則在室外望風，不旋踵濃烟四佈，董等見事已成，即相偕圖遁，幸發覺尙早，所內人員奮勇撲救，火勢迅即消滅，除空火柴盒略有焚燬外，並未釀成巨災，董等四人則經拘獲後，轉解地檢處偵查，董等供認放火不諱。經地檢處依刑事訴訟法二三○條第一項起訴，於昨晨十時在地院刑八庭由謝志英推事審理，告訴人陳念慈（敎養所管理）未到，由另一管理張慶昆代表，證明當日確見被告等在樓上放火，敎養所內二婦女丁阿娥·林翠英僉稱曾目睹吳月英藏匿火種，時為晚間七時三刻。詰之被告董阿翠，謂曾携草紙一紥，與其餘三被告携手上樓，由吳月英動手放火，惟其餘三被告咸否認上項事實，庭諭木案辯論終結，定期下月一日上午宣判。</p>
<h3>英公主結婚照　面貌幾難辨識</h3>
<p>·幾經轉折始由國際電台收到·</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本月二十日英國公主伊麗莎白與蒙巴頓上尉在倫敦結婚，廿二日本市字林西報上即有他倆在舉行婚禮時所攝的儷影出現，其下註明係聯合社的無綫電傳眞照相。這一張照片引起了不少人的興趣，一方面大家鶩嘆於它傳　的迅速，一方面又覺得它的成績並不如理想之佳，因為版面上兩個的面月幾乎已改變得令人難於辨識。</p>
<p>照片所以糢糊的原因，由於它並不直接從倫敦拍到上海，而是從倫敦拍到紐約，從紐約拍到舊金山，再從舊金山才拍到上海。經過這樣幾次轉折，在經過舊金山的時候已經有了差異。</p>
<p>機器陳舊成績欠佳</p>
<p>聯合社從何而得這張照片呢？事實上收到這一張傳眞照相的乃是在沙過大廈裏的交通部國際電台。國際電臺在二十日夜間即與舊金山方面接洽，當時氣候甚適宜於拍發傳眞照片，至廿一日淸晨五點三刻再去電詢問，氣候仍佳，第一張照片，即於此時傳來，但極為糢糊不淸，於是再請舊金山方面拍發一次，始於六時一刻收到第二張照片。</p>
<p>無綫電照相傳眞並不是最新的發明，在我國抗戰期間，昆明就有過這樣的設備，現在國際電台的一套機器，就是從昆明運回來的。因為機器已經陳舊，所以在試驗期中，這次英公主照片成績之不佳，機器一直還陳舊，亦為主要原因。最近國際電台已經向美國訂購了一套新機器運抵本市，待進口手續辦妥就可裝置，年底左右當可正式開放傳眞照相的業務了。</p>
<p>裝有對美轉播設備</p>
<p>國際電台還有一種向未受到注意因此未經充份利用的設備。談起這種設備牽涉到芝加哥論壇報的主持人麥考密克。麥考密克這次來華後，從未發表過對中國的觀感。但麥氏却曾於本月十四日與二十日晚上，在國際電台向美國廣播兩次。麥氏藉以在上海向美國廣播的就是國際電台的「轉播設備」（Program　Transmissicn　Service）。上海發出的廣播，由美國的RCA無綫電公司，轉接給美國各廣播公司，再分轉到全國電台，這樣全美各地就可收聽了。</p>
<p>這一種設備戰前就有，勝利後在去年恢復，但到現在為止，祗有幾位外國記者曾來廣播過，國際電台認為像中央社國際宜傳處等政府機關，大可利用這種設備，作為對外宣傳的工具。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕國大區域選舉昨日起在市參議會開票，上午九時正，由吳市長親自主持開票曲禮，儀式簡單而陸空。市長訓詞中，謂開票乃行憲之重要關鍵，我人應學習民主政治之新過程，盼各人均能鄭重將事。辭畢，即在參議員堅視之下，啓箱計票。擔任開票工作者，除管理員四十五人外，並臨時調用民政局職員十二人，分入組進行。窮一日之力，計共開票一三○，四七四張，內有廢票九四○張。至午後六時半計票結東時為止，各得票較多之候選人如下：錢大鈞九三八票，潘公展六八九四票，劉維熾九三六○票，方治三四九六六票，金振玉一○八七票，姜懷素一○八二一還，汪子奎一三七三○票，毛子偑一一一七票，陳啓天一一五四票，金侯城一○一三票，謝靑白一○六五票，鄭子良九九三票，金九林四四九一票，杜月笙一五二一一票，顧錦藻四○三三票，徐亮四三一八票，陸英耕三五一七票，殷芝齡二一一九四票，錢新之一○六二三票。昨日開票數月僅佔全部選票七分之一，且所開之票　乃任意選擇，可能偏於數區，故所得之結果殊不足以代表大選之整個形勢。今日上午起繼續開票，由於開票技術上之麻煩，現有人力不足應付，決自今日增加五組，連同原有之八組，共計十三組開票。</p>
<h3>新聞記者作壁上觀</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕職業團體選舉昨在市商會開票，並未舉行任何儀式。吳市長於九時許蒞塲，先囑開票所主任陳伯良向二十五位開票員宣讀「開票辦事細則」，及「廢票確定標準」。宣讀過程中，有百貨業職業工會代表，持紙請為該會「成立大會特刊」題目，市長欣然揮毫。嗣即親以鑰匙開啓工會團體第四投票所之票甄，並剝除封條，開票工作即告開始。市長再三叮囑全體須鄭重將事，旋即離去。塲內空氣嚴肅，監察人員並未全部出席，新聞記者及到塲參觀之候選人數人，均被摒登二樓作壁上觀。</p>
<p>百張一疊如點鈔票</p>
<p>票箱計五十四只，均封條從橫。昨因人手及時間關係，僅開啓農會，漁會，工會，工礦團體之一部分。選票檢出後並不唱票，僅由開票員用點鈔票方法分類，以一百張為一疊，由監察點　總數，將來全部票數除地方性團體外，均將彙送南京作全國性之統計。已開之票則尙須封存箱中六個月，以備作法律之查　根據。</p>
<h3>簡寫同音不作廢票</h3>
<p>昨開出選票中廢票極少，其中半為空白票，亦有以區域選票誤投職團票箱或塗改選票而依法作廢者。至於以簡體字或同音字書寫候選人姓名之選票，此次並未認作廢票。昨開票結果尙未統計完畢，工會方而已結出者以葉翔皋之三五一七○票居首。</p>
<h3>開會檢討技術得失</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市各區公所之民政股主任，昨開會　　　代選舉技術上之得失。均主張將在立委選舉時，以國民身份證譽代選舉權證領取選票。此點如不能做到，亦希望重發市民之選舉權證。選民名册亦主張重加編造，以此次國大選舉時投票之選民為藍本，先行公告，過期不聲明者作放棄論：區域選舉科長陳敏書表示：此項建議如能實行，有三大利益：一為手續簡單，二為選舉權不至重複，三為憑國民身份證領選舉權，相信不致有冒名頂替之事。惟目前尙有兩點困難：首先為如何能使國民身份證普遍領得，其次為在新辦法之下，區域選民及職團選民已無法分開，在行政技術上，尙有不便之處。以上各種意見，將彙成建議，呈請中央核准實施。</p>
<h3>方治　方法　方活　筆誤槪作廢票</h3>
<p>昨日開票時，發現廢票甚多。除空白票及塗改票外，以方治誤為「方治」「方法」「方浩」「方活」者最多。次僞藩公展誤為「藩公展」「藩公展」，及錢新之書「錢永銘」。此外，選舉非候選人之廢票亦甚多，其中蔣主席得票數尤為可觀云。</p>

<h3>提高蘇省民衆自衛警覺　保衛大徐州　魯豫皖湘鄂劃為軍區實施軍事措施</h3>
<p>徐州是江蘇的門戶，首都的北門，津浦與　海兩綫的要隘，它的重要性，與蘇北卅六縣及蘇魯豫皖鄰近各縣三千萬人民生命財產之安全，息息相關，我們在今天，江蘇的全體民衆必得要動員全部人力和物力，以抗戰八年的犧牲精神，來保衛大徐州，做到自衛衛土的地步。</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿二日快訊〕飛徐州洽商淸剿事宜，甫於昨日歸來的王主席懋功，於廿二日招待省會本外埠記者，因爲他這次談話具有促醒江蘇全省民衆的警覺性，記者特將王氏席間談話要點紀錄如下：</p>
<p>本人自徐州回來，深知關於徐州的一切情况，諸位是樂於知道的，現在分三點說明：</p>
<p>蘇北軍事</p>
<p>的狀況：自從劉伯誠繼陳毅陳賡之後，竄入大別山脈，企岡建立根據地，以擾亂我軍事的心臟區，先有睢寗之載，現在又加重兵力至七個縱隊，先後攻陷沛縣，簫縣，碭山，進而威脅徐州，一時情勢緊張，因此本人有徐州之行，諸位當知道，徐州是江蘇的門戶，而且又是首都的北門，對蘇，魯，豫，皖軍事有紹大的控制力量。本人特到徐州並對各專員縣長指示剿匪機宜，在徐住一日，現在對於徐州可說稍爲放下一點心來，在徐並和顧總司令商量，務期軍事與政治得能配合，並對陷區有所救濟，例如碭山戰事，該城所有黨政高級人員，均已壯烈殉職，僅縣長一人逃出，自衛隊亦損失很大，所有城防工事，就被完全破壊，慘狀更不忍盡述。蕭沛兩縣，亦曾一度陷落匪手，所有糧食衣物，更遭完全焚　，故對於一切善後事宜，不得不妥爲處置。　，關於</p>
<p>徐州城防</p>
<p>問題，徐州是首都之北門，有關蘇北卅六縣及附近蘇魯豫皖各縣三千萬人民的安全，所以對加强徐州城防，至爲重要。最近顧總司令歸來，徐州人民已較安定，相信竄匪當遭殘敗，最近，徐州近郊一百里內，已無匪踪，勝利　我，當更無問題。總計不到兩個月，匪已兩度竄擾，兵力皆有七八個縱隊，企岡流竄蘇北，若劉匪不滅，則我們仍要受害，爲令之計，只有加强徐州城防，以鞏固首都外國，保障蘇北，確立蘇·魯·豫·皖軍事重心，這個問題，顧總司令及本人皆認爲實在重要。但是徐州在抗戰期中，淪陷八年，勝利後又屢遭共匪之竄擾，中央也曾顧念到徐州的貧困，已撥款十四億元，建立徐州城防。事實上，徐州的防綫，長達一百四十里，需款二百億，和顧總司令商討結果，渠亦確知蘇省人民困苦，擬向中央再請撥款百億，另在徐州資產界壽集二百億元，現在已商洽好的，有華東煤礦公司捐輸一百億，麵粉每包加價兩萬元，共可得四五億元，各銀行有捐三億，二億者，最少亦有一億，共得三十多億元。　包每包加兩萬元，可得十億左右。還有滯留在徐州的貨物，與路局商量代遝，亦可得一筆款子。爲了籌款問題，本人在徐曾請各界協助，幷對各界人士說明，本人可負責會同顧司令官請求中央給予徐州無上的光榮。最使本人感激的，就是當時將數字提出時。他們莫不樂於捐輸，可說他們對本人還具有信心，對徐州之重要，亦十分明嘹。本人很希望我們江蘇—尤其江南—要效法此種精神，對長江的城防，太湖的湖防，各縣的城防，應確實將碉堡建立起來，爲了自己的生命財產，常共匪來的時候，搶的是你們有錢人的資產，焚燒你們的士地房屋，甚至還殺害你們的生命。我們要倒打算盤，爲全部生命財產，我們應當貢獻出財產的小部份來，希望你們（指記者）對於此點，多多宣傳，這是一件合算的事。本人受命中央，當然就等於是本省的管家人，本人也生一雙手，一對足，但是當匪來的時候，你們仍在打牌喝酒，過務醉生夢死的生活，我應當提醒你們，停止了打牌喝酒，快去分配工作保衛自己。　順帶報吿</p>
<p>六省聯防</p>
<p>會議的一點事情。關於六省聯防會議，在京召開時，極爲秘密，故首都新聞界對此皆一無所悉，茲將商討結果，簡單報吿給各位：　蘇·魯·豫·皖·湘·鄂已劃爲軍事區，實施一切軍事措施，要地方自衛團隊，十一月底，確實組織起來。　組織情報網，各鄉鎭應於十二月二十五日以前，完成其所有電話網。　確立戶籍保甲，以杜絕奸匪入境。　鄉鎭長之兩面通者，殺無赦，至於江蘇已劃爲軍事區，江南爲警備區，江北爲綏靖區，故一切皆爲軍事體制，必要時，得以軍法代替司法，普通法律，更不能眼制剿匪之策略，最可恨的，是江南之散匪及所謂地下人員，本人已通令各縣，眼於十一月底，即應將散匪肅淸。如有某地仍有匪蹤時，惟鄉鎭長專員是問。鄉與鄉間有匪，由縣長負責。縣與縣問有匪，由專員負責。如此更可防止以前聯防不力之情事，同時本人亦會通令江北沿江各縣，要督促自衛隊，阻止共匪南渡，江北船舶亦有船舶管理所，加以管理，至必耍之渡口，更應予以封鎖，同時渡船，更須經過檢查。共匪每到一處，必搜羅人，糧，衣物等，關於這點，我們尤應戒備，所有物資及非戰鬥人員，遇有緊急時，要有計劃的移到安全地區。（本報記者和香林）</p>

<h3>陳建新黃世民酈伯瑾　判決理由書全文</h3>
<p>自第二版接來</p>
<p>綜上觀察，被吿等旣均係新潮社社員，而新潮社又係共產黨之外團組織，在浙江大學內爭取各級學生自治會代表名額，並參加中共所領導之全國學聯會，復有鼓動學潮，吸收社員，傳閱左派醫報，製作讀書報吿種種秘密活動，是被吿等均係參加共產黨，胆任後方策動工作，已堪認定，被吿等在本院辯稱：新潮社係一學術團體，與共產黨毫無聯緊，共產黨之新潮社，為另一組織，與此各不相伴，不惟與其談話筆錄所稱，新潮社的各種活動，無形中似乎受了共產黨的影響，同時將來也可能投向共產黨，及我們的活動與形態的確定完全與共產黨相似之語前後兩歧，且如果新潮社與共產黨毫無關聯，何以其組織學術團體在政府及學校方面，迄未立案，而又秘密工作，時有戒　顧慮安全問題，至其提出浙江大學訓導處證明書一紙，證明陳建新，黃世民等，於三十四年春在浙大湄潭分部，創辦新潮壁報，曾向浙大訓導處登記，姑無論該證明書爲臨時所給，證據力已嫌薄弱，况係新潮壁報之證明，該壁報不過爲新潮社工作活動之一部，與整個之新潮社，尙屬兩事，縱令確向浙大登記有案，亦祗限該壁報張貼於浙大，已得許可，不能包括分佈各地之新潮社，已獲有合法之登記。又據抗辯，于子三本年十月二十九日之談話筆錄，係撩指紋，因于子二已死，無從對證，眞僞本無疑義云云，按該談話華錄，同係捺有指紋，但于子三及各該被吿於同月二十五日之談話筆錄，亦均簽名後捺蓋指紋之上，復已據于子二簽名，核與其本年十月二十五日談話筆錄及附卷親筆領物淸單（證據第五十號）之簽名，均相符合，殊不能謂有如何瑕疵，而遽指其記戰爲不實。再陳建新本年十月二十八日之談話筆錄，當時雖經拒絕簽名，然其所戰陳述內容，多屬吞吐其詞，眞情畢露，何能僅以未曾簽名，希　　異。又被吿等旣秘密活動，有所策應，即不能以尙未逾聲請登記脫離共產黨之期限，而阻却其犯罪，按共產黨在華北及東北各地稱兵擾亂，其目的固不僅在奪取政權，實欲摧毁國家一切組織，顯係以派動意圖破壞國體，竊據國土，及以非法之方法變更國憲，顚糧政府，而着手實行其後方密切潛伏之共產黨份子，策動學潮工潮，以及一切反動工作，紊亂社會秩序，遙爲呼應，乃其危害民國之整個計劃。依此論斷，被吿等雖則在滬杭等地秘密活動，旣與中共之叛變行爲有犯意之聯裕，自應負刑法第一百零二條第一項前段暴動內亂之罪責，已無疑義，核其以共同犯罪之意思，而分担其實行行爲之一部，即應以共同正犯論，與帮助犯僅以帮助他人之意思，從事構成犯罪要件以外之行爲者，殊不相同，原起訴書認被吿等係刑法第一百條第一項之帮助犯，難謂適當，應予變更法條。被吿等均係靑年，因感苦悶，誤入歧途，於被捕後均有悔悟之表示，就其犯罪後之熊度，予以審酌，爰於法完刑內處以低度之刑。據上論結，應依刑事訴訟法第二百九十一條前段，第二百九十二條刑法第二十八條，第一百零一條第一項前段，第一百條第一項第五十七條第三十七條第二項，第三十八條第一項第一款第二款，判決如主文。本案經本院檢察官李　彭蒞庭執行職務，浙江高等法院刑事第一庭審判長推事張啓鵬，　作梯，李芬。（全文完）</p>

<h3>一個兒童敎育問題　怎樣使小孩子不哭（續完）</h3>
<p>— 陳鶴琴</p>
<p>第六種是「疾病」。小孩子一有了病就會哭。做父母的必須隨時檢查小孩子的體溫，要研究病的原因，病在那一部分。最好立刻請醫生治撩。不要不明病因，就亂拿藥給他吃。　第七種是「不舒服」。小孩子在不舒服的時候也要哭的。譬如尿布有了尿，就得立刻更換，不然他會覺得不舒服，就要啼哭。</p>
<p>我們要不使小孩子哭，就要研究他哭的原因，是不是餓了。或者是因痛，因渴，因冷，因熱，因病，還是有什麽地方不舒服。我們明白了他哭的原因，我們就可以設法解除它。大人固然可以放心，小孩子也可以健康無恙。</p>
<p>生理上哭的原因我已講了，現在從心理上來分析小孩子哭的原因。最重要的有三點：</p>
<p>第一點是「懼怕」。小孩子常常有這種情形，譬如怕聽一種奇聲怪音，或者小孩子晚上不肯睡覺，大人故意說着貓來了，狗來了來威嚇他，使小孩子養成一種懼怕的心理，或者聽了一些神鬼之類的故事。但以後小孩子只要一聽到這類聲音，見到一些貓狗，提到這種故事與名詞，他就會哭。</p>
<p>第二點是「暗示」。有許多事情，小孩子並不會感覺到，但常常受了大人的暗示而哭。譬如小孩子跌了一交，本來不哭，也不覺得痛；有些天人偏喜說些「小寶寶不要哭羅」，「小寶寶不痛　」這一類的廢話。因此一提，小孩子不哭的也要哭了，不痛的也要呌痛了。</p>
<p>第三點是「習慣」上的哭。小孩子的壊習慣，都是大人養成他的。醫如當他睡醒的時候，看見旁還沒有人，就要哭起來，而大人也常常如此，非要等到小孩子哭了，纔會去抱他。若第一次如此，第二次如此，就養成了小孩子睡醒時候哭的習慣，我們要避免這種惡習，最好不要離開他，等到醒來的時候就去抱他，再說幾句如「寶寶醒了嗎？眞乖呀！我們起來囉……」這類的話。那以後睡醒時，他會等着大人來抱，也不會哭了。又如吃東西的時候，小孩子總喜歡自己動手，不願意大人拿給他的。你如不答應，他就會哭。假使怕他哭就讓他自己拿，那以後凡是他要不到的東西，都會以哭作要脅。所以做大人的逢到道種情形，就要硬一硬心腸，他要哭就讓他哭，必須不哭了，知進自己不能拿的道理了，再給他吃，那以後就不會有道個習慣。</p>
<p>小孩子爲什麽常常要哭，祗要問一問大人爲什麼不管。至少也是大人管得不好；小孩十並不是喜數哭，而是因生理上與心理上的自然的要求，所以我說小孩子要哭，是大人管理的不對。</p>
<p>這裏，我希望有了孩子的父母。隨時要研究如何使小孩子少哭，隨時要研究如何避免小孩子哭的方法。否則，一天到晚觝聽到小孩子的哭聲，大人固然難受，就是小孩子哭多了，也要影響健康的。</p>

<h3>紡調擧辦棉紗聯合配銷　袁新主委昨已視事　今後議價決顧到廠商再生產成本</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部紡織事業調節委員會新任主委袁良，業於昨日上午十時許，由經部陳部長伴同，正式到會就職視事。當由陳部長召集該會全體高級職員，一一與袁氏介紹。袁氏旋徇新聞界之請，發表談話，要點有四：　棉紗聯合配銷試行辦法，係經行政院張院長，王副院長，農林部左部長，經濟部陳部長，國行張總裁，共同審定。紡調會爲執行機構，當秉承辦理。至實施技術，常再與各關係方面，會商洽它。舉辦聯配宗旨，純爲配合非常時期之需要而來，深望各廠商合作。　我國工業幼稚，僅棉紡事業尙具基礎。政府對棉紡事業，決無摧殘之意。除一方面顧到人民之衣着問題外，另方面亦當顧到紗廠之困難。紡調會目前要着，在設法解除原料困難，國棉以交通關係，未能及時供應，故仍將設法訂購外棉補充。同時應積極取締國棉　水　雜，深望原棉供應充裕後，能减輕紗廠生產成本。　紗布外銷，在國內未能自給自足以前，宜加節制。爭取外匯，似可自輸出猪　礦砂等外銷物資着手。　今後棉紗議價，決依生產成本，加合法利潤計算，以維持紗廠再生產成本爲原則。</p>
<p>〔本報訊」紡調會昨公佈棉紗配銷試行辦法後，記者走訪棉紡及複製業若干領袖，歸納意見有二：　按規定上海及外埠棉紗複製業各廠戶，須彙報紡調會辦理登記。惟對鑿請登記各廠戶設立年月及資信等，似應有嚴格之限制。　聯配辦法，暫在上海區域試辦。茲配銷對象，已包括上海及外埠各複製業，則本市產紗勢難供應全國複製業之需耍。另方而上海區複製業原有配額，將吿銳减。凡此種種，勢須在擬訂實施細則時，另行愼重商討處理辦法云。</p>
<h3>紡調議價未變動　棉紗巿况平疲　布疋浮多了結實銷寥落</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會棉紗議價昨未變動，廿支紗仍維二五五〇萬元原價。</p>

<p>棉在市况，晟開即呈明平暗疲之勢，旋以實銷仍淸，浮散因銀根抽緊，多頭了吐甚擊，塲內賣氣甚濃，人心轉虛，行情盤低。結果各檔細布比週末軋降一·二萬元，惟龍頭及陽鶴二檔升五千元，四君子嗶猛嘰瀉三萬元，士林布以染料價貴，去化尙佳，行情獨漲一·二十萬，其他各布，脚地仍堅硬。</p>
<p>現棉趨跌</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况，上午因進戶納胃稀少，市勢轉疲，價格回降。午後以棉紗塲外喊價回高，人心略振，同業逢低有吸，價稍穩定。終以漲勢過甚，更以棉紗寶行配銷，花似過高，難合成本，故紗廠絕無納胃。結果下跌二十萬左右，各檔成交一二〇〇包。送廠價做開靈寶五三五萬七千，棧交價做開靈寶五二五萬，沙市五一四萬七千，冲沙四七一萬二千，通州四〇五萬一千，啓東美種四七一萬，海提尖三六〇萬，周浦籽花八四萬五千。</p>

<h3>華股流言助買　小型所漲獨多</h3>
<p>華股昨大鈔等流言助買，檯面奇聚，低後易回，即交永紗漲達四一六元新高峯，景福新光勤興所漲更多，尤以景福最露鋒芒。</p>
<p>晨開</p>
<p>時承上週六午後餘波而見高，永紗自三八四元及三八七元開後，交易稀少，即交永紗有十餘分鐘靜默，遞交自三八九元起，由二二八號等賣出，八五號等並售即交，而低至三六九元及三七五元。一四號等趁低買進而略升，一八三號等脫手，九八號出即交，仍難支持。塲外息價仍開二角一及二角五分半，一三〇號復賣即交，銀根覓緊，而跌至即交三六五元，遞交三七二元低價。一四號等來進即交，三二號等進遞交，圈外黑市復漲，人心見秀，逐漸回升至即交三八〇元遞交三八九元光景，而後以三七九元之價收市。雜股疲後未能回上，巾泥新亞景綸所降最多，小型股十分秀利，尤以景福有七五號吸收，領袖小股，結果較上週六即交股計景福漲半成强，國貨成交少，亦好半成。新亞中泥各跌一成，景綸低半成，華新新華榮豐永公尙平，餘者榮辱均微。</p>
<p>午後</p>
<p>上塲即昂永紗回升至三八六元及三九五元，八四號等出遞交，一七六號等供遞交而退至三七九元及三八四元低價。一四八號等進即交，六五號等進遞交，升至三九四元及三九八元，一五五號等脫手，國行交換差進，略有回低，一五二號等急購即交，三二號等紛買，流言利買，遞景福先由一二一號等掛漲停，繼而即交景福亦由二〇四號掛漲停，動興新光五和亦迫限度，臨收時永紗漲到即交四一六元新高價，遞交四一九元。一三〇號等了結，遂以四一四元及四一七元之價收市。美亞信和所升亦多，後者亦達新高價。結果較晨收即交股計新光漲停後微回，景福勤興五和漲停，信和中法景　內衣漲一成强，華新永紗美亞永公榮豐中紡統益中絲各升一成，新華閘北火柴國貨各升半成。遞交股計景福漲停，信和華豐新光勤與各漲一成强，永紗升半成。塲外各老股屢經見秀，尤屬買盤居多。</p>
<h3>統債下游外股盤高</h3>
<p>公債昨見下游，銀根緊迫，買戶掃興。統丙晨開二四〇〇〇元自二四四〇〇元起，盤低至二二七〇〇元而後有圓。五〇〇室三六〇室買進，五五二室五〇三室則出。結果較上週六計甲乙跌九百元，丙降一千五，丁挫一千二，戊降一千元，成交不過四百萬</p>
<p>外股昨初低繼高，怡紗自最初三一〇〇〇〇元起，盤高至三三〇〇〇〇元光景高峯收市。證劵帮廣帮洋商等先出後進，金融帮有納，港申電縮至三元九，雜股勢仍堅定。結果較上週六計航業紙版各漲一成，怡紗鋼業升半成，業廣尙平，餘咸小升。</p>
<h3>國行負責方面否認發新大鈔</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨市塲謠傳國行發行額面較大之鈔劵，並謂樣本業已發現，繪影繪聲，羣疑莫測。記者特親往國行負寶方面探詢，據稱：並無其事。該負責人並稱：國行曾於上週末發行中華書局平版承印之一萬元新鈔，及美商保安公司承印之五百元關金券兩種。其面額均爲一萬元，以上兩種新鈔券之樣本，業已送達各商業行荘。外傳已發現親面較大新鈔劵之樣本，或即因比誤會云。</p>
<p>呢羢回昂</p>
<p>呢羢零躉行情，昨均全部叵昂。白邊麥而登升漲至七十萬元，章華花呢每碼喊沽一百十五萬元，中紡黑灰大衣呢售一百萬元。同業人心多數看再好，交易須即期及三五天支票，雖係天冷冬銷進展關係，然黑市金鈔狂漲，亦一主要原因也。茶會及棋盤街協大正餘諸大批發戶，花呢趨勢最佔優勝，大衣呢平厚呢較形活潑，海龍長毛羢極爲廣銷，絲光羽紗紗背縀，袖裏綢法西襯等，成交均夥。業內外人至漢口阪帶呢羢者甚多。</p>

<h3>小說技術談</h3>
<p>— 味逸</p>
<p>不「漏臉」的作者</p>
<p>小說的技術，常在那裏轉變。最顯著的轉變，便是在從前小說中，作家是自己「漏臉」的，在現代小說中，作家已不見了。在費爾鈍（Fidlding）司各德（Scott）　可蘭（Thackeray）伊麗德（Gcorgc　Eliot）的小說中，處處可見作者自己在指示讀者，把書中人物的成敗原由，說得明明白白，以闡發其行爲哲學。至於現代小說，雖也偶有借題發揮的地方，但在故事中，作者自身，失不出現，決不插入一句話，而讓書中人物來說明其感想與行動，讓故事本身來解釋一切。這是現代小說的一個特點。這樣才能把小說從史實，哲理，科學中劃分出來，自成一軍，否則只是他們的附庸而已。</p>
<p>費爾鈍比較來得謹愼一點，常把他的感想寫在導言中。司各德，薩可蘭，屈魯伯（Trollope），梅理迪（Meredith）諸人，則隨意在書中發表他們的意見，减少了戲劇性的緊張狀態。讀者所要知道的乃是寶在的生活經驗，作者的指示，本是多餘的。但十九世紀的大作家，犯這毛病的很多。越是緊要關頭，經他三言兩語點穿了，越覺得毫無意味。從技術方面說，也可以說他們只圖省力，不肯細寫。</p>
<p>維多利亞時代的小說，有三種趨勢是顯然的。　作者用敎訓的口吻來唱高調。　好與讀者討論書中人物，心有偏見，希望這者也採取司樣態度。　受科學狂熱的影響，想解釋書中人物的行動，使我們知道某種現象，適合於人類天性的晋遍定律，這三種優勢，可說是互有關係的。但到了二十世紀，技術轉換方向，便不甚流行了。</p>
<p>由此可知在這兩個時代內，講演故事的方法，大不相同。維多利亞時代的小說，是作家在演講書中人物，而不讓書中人物來表現他們自己。這種作法，呆扳得象代數中的公式一般，全無使人想像的餘地。現代小說作家則不然，他們自己不肯多說話，只讓書中人物來表現他們的感想。按術不同，方法是變換了。</p>
<h3>論元曲崑唱</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>元曲究竟是怎樣唱法，可惜現在已經失傳了。明代嘉靖末年，何良俊聘請當時唯一精通北曲的老樂工頓仁，敎授他家中女伶唱元人雜劇（見何良後四友黨叢說卷三十七），這恐怕是最後的元曲遺響了吧？我們現在只能在崑曲裏所留下的十餘　元曲，能够依稀領會元曲的唱法，但它已經是「元曲崑唱」，而不是元曲本來的唱法了。</p>
<p>我現在想要試着探討的，是這一小部份的元曲，怎麽還會保存到現在，它是用什麼方法保存下來的。我個人的看法，認爲這十餘齣元曲本身曲調優美，是一個原因，但更重大的一個原因，却是元曲被明淸傳奇甚至宮廷戲吸收了去，元曲是以寄居蟹的地位保持了它那生命的延續的。</p>
<p>在較早的曲選裏，如「　頭百鍊」御集「絃索元音」即錄有「鮫綃記訪賢」，這一　就是元羅貫中風雲會第三折，俗名「訪普」，開頭有「水晶宮鮫綃帳」二語，故以爲名。這「鮫綃記」並非沈鯨的「鮫綃記」，不過巧立名目而已。又錄有「四郡記單刀」，其實就是元關漢卿的「關大王單刀會」。</p>
<p>在「來鳳館精選傳奇」裏，又誤題風雲會爲喬夢符的「金滕記」，刀會亦題四郡記。吳昌齡的西遊記則題作夏均政的「北唐僧」，所選的二　，「西遊」（新水令，纔離了呌佛樓）當與「老回回東樓呌佛」有關，「餞行」（點絳唇，第一來）當與「唐三藏西天取經」有關。</p>
<p>從上列兩種曲選中，至少可以知道關漢卿的「刀會」，吳昌齡的「西遊記」以及羅貫中的「訪普」，明末淸初仍傳唱甚盛。</p>
<p>到了淸乾隆年間，許多戲都被吸收到宮庭大本戲裏去，再分齣的流傳出來，於是　變旣多。像聲理亂絲似的，頭緒也就愈繁了。我頗懐疑「昇平寶筏」「慈悲願」之類容納了吳昌齡的回回和北餞，同時又容納了楊景賢的「撇子」「認子」「胖姑」和「借扇」。</p>
<p>同樣的揣測，我假設「昭代　韶」容納了「激良」和「五台」，「鼎峙春秋」容納了「刀會」·「情忠記」裏容納了「掃秦」，我們在「崑曲粹存」裏已經看到。「金貂記傳奇」有合刻的本子。</p>
<p>伶人們不管你這齣戲是誰寫的，只要是同一個朝代，同敘某一個人，他就可以硬把它們拉在一起；但這可苦了我們研究戲劇史的人。</p>
<p>元曲，還能在今天演唱，我們是應該高興的。聽說愛麥處限路九號警社將由仙電社爲籌募崑曲祖師廟基金，假座演唱崑曲四天（廿六至廿九，每晚七時半開鑼），第一二天正演的是元人關漢卿的「單刀會」，朱凱的昊天塔「五台」和孔文卿的東窗事犯「揥秦」。除元曲外他們還演明汪廷訥的獅吼記「梳裝跪記」，徐霖　　記「打子」，許自昌水滸記「活提」，阮大鍼燕子箋「狗洞」，淸范希哲雁翎甲「盜甲」，邱國虎發彈「山亭」，曹寅「虎口餘生」全本，洪昇長生殿「絮閣，驚變埋玉」，李玉永團圓擊鼓「堂配」等，以及弋勝「借靴」，四平調「思凡下山」，武班戲乾元山，簡直是一部活的戲劇史。</p>
<h3>小鎭</h3>
<p>— 秦嶺</p>
<p>二年前的秋天，為了職業我到了常熟X家巿，這個閉塞的小鎭起始會給予我太多的難堪與不安，但結果我的離開居然引起許多人的眼淚。</p>
<p>從常熟搭輪船抵靠X家市的埠頭後，還得翻一些沙土的斜坡，爬上大路便有許多小車候着接客，因為嫌車子太顛簸，把行李安置妥當，便呌被派來接我的茶房老榮領路，自己跟在軍後步行，兩旁的棉田，花生，高粱，粟子沿着蜿蜒的沙土路成片推展過去，草虫悠長而衰弱地嘶嗚，秋天黃昏的太陽乏力地照着大地，沙土上我們的足聲切擦切擦地　，我第一次接觸到眞正的鄉村，也第一次見到土地偉大的力之表現。到市街時，黃昏的陰影已相當濃重了，磨坊門前　着幾頭　子，正匆忙地移動着下顎嚼草料。豆腐舖前掛滿了一張張新出鍋的豆腐皮，爐火熊熊的鐵舖，轉動得發響的紡紗機……一種時殊的氣氛包圍了這條小街，三三兩兩的村姑倚在門前聊天，我們一行人跑過時，都投着驚訝的眼色：</p>
<p>「哈地方來的」？</p>
<p>「好樣式」！</p>
<p>「像個鬼」！</p>
<p>這些語句夾雜着笑聲像尖刺一般上來，低下頭看看自己的裝飾，白紗外套，黑旗袍，白皮鞋，似乎並沒有炫目的都市色彩，那麽是我的眼鏡抑是頭髪的式樣惹她們生氣了？想到以後要在這些人中間生活還不知怎樣長的時期，我嗒然了。就在這種心情下到達了我的工作地點，見過廠長，我被安頓在指定的寢室裏，有點泥土的潮濕味，窗前一個池塘，栽着幾株柳樹，這樣，開始了我的村居生涯。</p>
<p>第一次與我交接的本鎭人，是我們廠屋的男東張太太，二十五歲的年齡却有了三個孩子，讀過幾年書，提得起記帳的筆，也管得下荘稼的雜務，所以，她的丈夫可以終日悠哉優哉地坐茶館，上酒舖，說不定三天五天還得上城去聽次戲，所以，她在本領也便落得個賢能名兒了。打開她家大廳背面的腰門，便是我們辦公室前的小天井，她老愛探過半個頭呌着：</p>
<p>「秦先，（這裏對「先生」的簡稱）。過這邊來坐坐嘛」！</p>
<p>一跑到她那裏，玉米，芋艿，南瓜子，豆萊乾，成堆往你面前捧，而且非一一吃下去不可。對於鄉村的土產，我不怎麼嗜愛，可是，她的那份熟誠却令人不能不勉強裝點下去，翻動着她桌子上的針綫盒興保存得如是完整的民國廿六年出版的兒童書報，我暗暗讚美這位農村的主婦。她家用來招待上賓的還有一架留聲機，唱片已有點沙沙之聲，看見我們去，孩子便要拉着媽媽：「聽洋戲」，於是，洋人大笑的片子旋轉起來，孩子，母親跟着笑，笑聲引進了鄰人，不問情由也笑得前仰後合，她們的笑態逗得我忍　不禁，於是來一個　堂。她總拉着我的手說：</p>
<p>「我很歡喜您，自己又沒有妹妹，您肯作我的乾妹麼」？我點了頭表示接受她的意見，但到我難開小鎭爲止，她仍稱我「秦先」，我也始終稱她「張太太」而已，她不相信我沒有結婚：</p>
<p>「二十多的姑娘，還會不結婚麽？情敢是先生在內地，一個人閒着氣悶才出來作事的」？</p>
<p>她自作聰明地下著結論。我不和她分辯，不信就不信吧，本來，早婚是這裏的風氣，十五六歲的姑娘就有作母親的，若說人生是一　戲劇，那麽她們都是富有天才的演員。</p>
<p>小鎭的生活像一泓秋水似地平靜安閒。這未始不是本鎭人個性恬淡所致，就以街市來說，全鎭僅有前後兩條街，兩街的店舖十之五六是茶樓菜館，酒舖子，趕早市的人，一壺淸茶帶客早點趁便談談買賣簡直成了慣例，所以茶樓內帶賣燒餅油條饅頭糯米糕什麼的，下午又加上彈詞，整天就不愁冷落了。菜館的橱窗內陳列了大堆的鮮魚鮮肉鷄鴨子，你會担心一天中也許賣不掉，可是，每天那麽多的顧客進進出出，維持了菜館的繁榮，更有小鎭的酒舖是頗有意味的去處，一交秋，螃蟹，燒羊肉，花生米，靑豆子陪着菉豆燒上市了，伙計吆五喝六地張羅，客人們掛着紅薰薰的笑臉，閒着麽？坐下低斟淺酌吧，不得閒的人可以凑上沿街的櫃檀來上口杯，儘管是竹布圍裙靑大楫，吃喝總够資格，對着松鶴軒，六朝居，太白遣風，阮嵇延澤……的陳舊汚黃的匾額，您的思緒被拉回了幾千年。</p>
<p>可是，小鎭的繁華只建築在「吃」的上面，就是這種繁華的背面也有着可怕的陰影，夾雜於酒樓茶館之間更存在着燕子窠與妓院，不正常的靈魂與肉體的買賣伸張了頗足驚人的勢力；剝開小鎭的外套，裏面是個腐　，卑汚，　噁的屍體，與它天賦的沃野肥土相比較，眞是個太令人惋嘆的對照。</p>
<p>不過，小鎭本身也曾給我很多的溫情與風趣，雖然我的寢室那麽簡陋，有月光的晚上，疎枊淡月撫摸着我的小窗時，池水就像我的母親，對她我吐露過多少心頭的抑　與不懽呵，那些爬滿鮮紅枸杞子的竹籬，臨流淺架的小木橋，與那片碧野靑天的沙壤都曾接受下我的鄕愁之訴說，在鄕間一年餘的生活，我能安然忍受過來，不能不感謝他們的慰藉，一切可　念的人們與景物，願他們平安永存。</p>
<h3>蘭</h3>
<p>— 陸士雄</p>
<h3>啟顏錄</h3>
<p>— 愷公</p>
<p>除人侯白，字君素，好學有捷才，滑稽善辯，常為誹諧雜說，人多愛狎之。著「啓顏錄」二巷，皆幽默故事，惜原書已佚。「太平廣記」間有綴錄，茲引其一則，以見一斑。「山東人娶蒲州女，多患瘦，其妻母項攖甚大。成婚數月，婦家疑婿不　，婦翁置酒盛會親戚，欲以試之。問曰：「某郎在山東讀書，應識道理。鴻鶴能嗚，何意？」曰：「天使其然」。又曰「松柏冬靑，何意？」日：「天使其然」。又曰「道旁樹有骨　，何意？」曰，「天使其然」。婦翁曰，「某郞全不識道理，何因浪住山東！」因以戲之曰：「鴻鶴能嗚者頭項長，松柏冬靑者心中强，道邊樹有骨　車撥傷：豈是天使其然？」婿曰：「蝦蟆能鳴，豈是頸項長？竹亦冬靑，豈是心中强，夫人項下　如許大，豈是車撥傷」？」</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「老大哥，您還沒知道我一趟吃了多大的　咧」。鶴見爲他自己聲辯了：「眞他媽的巴子把我弄苦了！……您知道，這一趟前後一共是幾天？……</p>
<p>「七天吧。」我隨口答應。</p>
<p>「不！」鶴見瞧了瞧手表：「現在是零點二十五分，已經是交到又一天了，我說是九天……。」</p>
<p>「怎麽九天呢？」我沒有十分在愈，七天也好，九天也好，這兩個數目，對於我並無重要議意。</p>
<p>「打七月三十一日算起哪；今天是八月八日零時了，頭尾在內，還能不是九天？」鶴見曉曉申辯着。</p>
<p>「就算九天罷……怎麼樣？」我奇怪他爲什麼要這樣注意這麽一點小事，小的簡直不相干。</p>
<p>「不，」鶴見把剛吸了幾口的一枝「敷島」牌，像磨墨似的，在烟灰盤內，一速幾廳，磨成了一團烟糟，却又重新燃上了一枝新的：「您也許認爲不關重要，可是您還沒有知道其中的苦味——身體和構神的——您瞧我！」</p>
<p>我聽他的話，果眞對他面部，細訓端詳了一下。鶴見確然失形了，向來鹽潤飽滿的雙頰，這時，紅色　成了靑資色，也癟下去了不少，有些像病後，或連夜失眠之後。那雙精光灼灼的眼睛，變得　滯滯地，眼眶也下陷了；連帶那一對神采飄逸的秀眉，這時也似乎搭拉下來，乍眼看去，隱約像個八字。是的，他確然有些失形，有些淸減了。</p>
<p>「不是說那老頭兒，那老什麽？………老「忘八？」（指近衛）是的，那老傢伙不是下了手令，呌我回東京受訓嗎？」鶴見瞧着我，把眼睛睜得圓圓地。</p>
<p>「對呀。」我却把目光，從他的面部移到了他的手上；因他這時又在揉碎第二隻烟捲了。</p>
<p>「受什麽息訓？」這大概又是關外說話習慣，幾乎每句都是一個吃了生米似的間句。鶴見問着，立刻又自己解答起來：「受訓，極可能是開軍事法庭的代名詞！老大哥，您想我得到這個手令之後，心下還能沉得住嗎？」</p>
<p>我沒有開口接腔，只於是裂開嘴，　了　牙，表示替他　受，給他一點同情。</p>
<p>「媽的巴子，就像兩個打鼓手，在我胸口胡說霸道地搗着一般，您　該多們不是味兒。」鶴見把嗓音提得很高，一口氣說了出來。</p>
<p>「的確不是味兒！」我應酬了他一句。難怪他把七個日影，硬要說成九天；想必在這「九天」內，曾經吃了一番大苦。</p>
<p>以上是我們叙話的開塲對白，緊接，鶴見在深深呼了幾；烟捲之後，便把這番經過，巨細不遺地吿訴了我。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>隨手關門</h3>
<p>— 亦</p>
<p>西北風一起，大家身上有些凜凜然，「隨手關門」的小紅條兒，應時而生；尤其在辦公室的衝要出入之處，要是房屋的建築已經陳舊，檣壁上泥土剝落，而呈現着一種莫可名狀的神秘色彩時，那扇門上，或是門旁，貼上一個狹畏的白紙條兒，上面歪斜地擺着四個字，你仔細地一看，不是「隨手關門」而何！</p>
<p>西比利亞的冷氣團，或簡稱日寒流，侵襲本市之日，便是這種小字條兒出現之時。偉大哉，天氣的變化；渺小哉，文字的無　！</p>
<p>假定我國科學進步，生產不落後，所有辦公室的門上，一定都裝上啓閉自如的活動彈簧，無論你跑出跑進，只消身子一動，滑過了門口，背後砰的一聲，不，並沒有多大的音響，那扇門便自動地閉上了。然而談何容易，這種新式配備，也許不是十年八年的短時間中，得以普遍實現。</p>
<p>物力不足，人力有餘，大飯店，菜館，舞塲，用小郞拉門，客人們不煩舉手投足，出入自由，無牽無掛，値得提倡。然而這種塲所，銷金爲主，羊毛出在羊身上，顧客們的享受，還不是他們自己的貢獻。少數地方可以這樣辦，推而廣之，定然行不通。</p>
<p>求人不如求己，我們不妨先行探討一下，如何一般人不肯或不願，不層，甚至不會關門？這裏，我們覺得如要使大家關鬥，必先從養成良好習慣開始。西人說：「老狗做不出新把戲」，良好的習慣一定要從小養成：中年人忙於衣食，或惑於名利，誰指有那麽多的閒功夫，來練習關門或開門。老年人更不用說，弄得不好，他說，不關便怎樣？其奈他何。只有敎我們的下一代，實行從小「小手關門」，庶幾還有挽救！</p>
<p>由於「隨手關門」的字條兒，聯想到某他各種民開的條兒，益證文字之無靈，科學的萬能。譬如「姜太公在此……」，「泰山石敢當……」，「天皇皇……」，「出賣重傷風……」，以至「××請上一步」，「痰吐入盂」等等，一切都顯示民間的敎育程度太差，太隨便，太沒有自尊心，和從小養成的良好習慣。我們決不應該對這些字條加以非笑，我們只覺得一切應該反躬自省，不要粉飾門面，好高　遠。</p>
<p>一門又一門，門字的花樣也眞多。老子說：玄之又玄，「衆妙之鬥」，玄牝之門，是謂天地之根，口氣何其偉大。目下民治之門旣開，競選運動，如火如茶，國大和立委，倒是門當戶對。古人造字，以一扇爲一戶，兩扇謂之門。世界上各種爭端，起於門戶之見的，不勝枚舉，剖斗折衡而民不爭，胸無畦徑，門戶自除，門羅的門戶開放主義，才得實垷。</p>
<p>西洋人亦有在門上標着「請叩門」字樣的，這倒與「隨手關門」，適得其反。國人對於各個人退居時的隱秘自由，似乎不大注意。往往續衝直撞，侵入人家的書房臥室，以爲親熱和知己的表示。西洋男女儘管在海灘上脫得赤條條的奄無顧忌，可是對於此道倒極爲講究。無論家人朋友，遇到人家關着門時，總得先在門上輕輕叩上一叩，聽得裏面一聲「請」時，方得進去。辦公室當然也不例外。</p>
<p>葛洪說：「……或有不通主人，便共突前，嚴飾未辨，不復窺聽，犯門折關，踰垝穿隙，有似抄劫之至也。其或妾媵藏避不及，至搜索隱僻，就而引曳，亦怪事也。夫君子之居室，猶不掩家人之不備，故入門則揭聲，升堂則下視，而唐突他家，將何理乎？……」稚川是晋朝人，去今千餘年，當時的人旣已有入門揚聲的好習慣，而同時又不免有犯門折關，不願人家退居自由者。那末先有壊的行爲，還是先有禮節？這和先有雞，還是先有卵的問題，似乎爲同樣的不易解答了。</p>
<p>門雖設而常關，自可减少許多麻煩；入公門，鞠躬如也，以及立不中門，行不履閥，也都是禮貌週至的表示。子日：由之瑟，奚爲於丘之鬥……子日：由也，升堂矣，未入於室也。子路眞是自討沒趣，鼓瑟不合雅頌，致爲夫子所資。要是他們到別處去奏樂，而不及於老先生之門，也許不會發生這種不快意的事。聖人重視其門，決不馬虎。够得上身列門牆的，能有幾人。否則眼巴巴望着數　的高牆，不得其門而入。做了白髮盈願的老黨生，還給人家看做門外漢哩。</p>
<p>今人但求實利，不一定考究門風，一且瓦片翻身，自會有人把豪門的頭街，恭恭敬敬的給他按上去。從此金門玉堂，一帆風順。門閥旣高，門庭若市。可是弄的不好，要是忽然倒　的話」立刻使又門可羅雀了。</p>
<p>今日百物昂貴，民生凋敝，消極者只有兩扇看不見的門，第一是呼　無門，第二是入地無門。大有大難，小有小難，雖願「隨手關門，」其奈無門何。說者謂曰來做金鈔股票投機者，他們打的都是活門，門門皆中，其喜可知。美國的貸款，高山滾竣，去題尙遠；只聽得樓梯響，不看見人下來。朝野佇踵，無門可啓，何况關乎。若得杜魯門氏正式宣佈，投機之風或可少戢，今則惟有望洋興嘆，過屠門而大　而已。</p>
<h3>言是而非</h3>
<p>— 風人</p>
<p>淸人筆記有記王嗚盛一條，略謂：「王鳴盛未達時，家貧，奔走京師大家，每入人家，輒以手作捧物狀，口噓噓作聲，人怪而問之，曰：「招莫家之財氣入我懐抱也。」其貪鄙如此。然所作詩文，悍然有氣節，不類其所爲，人或問之，則曰：「口碑不過一世，而詩文則傳諸百世，百世之後，口碑漸沒，吾詩文乃可傳矣」。』</p>
<p>言和行往往是不能一致的，講起話來頭頭是道的人，實在倒要留心留心他的行爲，錢牧　的文章，慷慨激昂，通史可法也不及他。後人如果光讀殷汝耕「亡國慘」的大作，又哪裏想得到他會是華北的頭號漢奸呢。（燈下雜記）</p>
<h3>地球上的生命</h3>
<p>— 破輪</p>
<p>地球生存的全部時間，一般人所估計的祇是一個大槪的數目，然而時間之長是無可否認的。而人類在地球上出現，但是不久以前的事情。</p>
<p>人類的祖先名呌比特康特洛普（Pitccantrop），是猿人或猴人的意思，是證明人類從動物世界變化而來的，關於這一點，已經沒有問題了。</p>
<p>在比較古遠的地層裏，從沒有發現過人類及其所使用的工具的遺跡，這就是人類遲於地球生存的有力證明。</p>
<p>但在還沒有人類以前，却早有飛禽走　了。因爲這亦是從地層所獲得的事實；而且證明無論是飛禽，無論是走獸，都是爬蟲類所形成的。譬如說，在烏克　的頓河岸上，在伏洛聶士附近的地方，曾發現許多石槐，石塊裏充滿了許多古代海洋動物的遺跡。同時更有趣的，是吿訴了我們：現在頓河所流過的地方，在幾百萬年之前，是一個海，海裏發展著古代的海洋生命。而在　個海裏，那時所活着的動物，稱爲海達。同時，還有肩肱類的動物。</p>
<p>這一切秘密，都是無言的石塊所講述的。</p>
<p>地球上的生命似乎是從魚類開始，但並不這樣。在魚類之前，在古代海洋裏，還生存過許多比魚類還要簡單的動物。如海綿，珊瑚蟲，水母，特殊的蝦等。不過，往地層更深人，還有比這更早的，這些動物又更簡單了，簡單得不像現代任何一種動物。</p>
<p>地層證明地上的生命產生得非常之早，並且是從很簡單的生物開始的。</p>
<h3>如何運用眼睛</h3>
<p>— 小雯</p>
<p>很少人知道憂　的思想會傷害我們。而愉悅快樂的思想是會造成快樂的眼睛的。因爲限睛是非常靈敏的器官，和腦部及神經系統有密切關連；煩惱，恐佈，忿恨等消極的情緒對眼睛的傷害是嚴重的。慣於煩傷的人們往後必給他們的眼睛一莫的大損害。</p>
<p>使眼睛鬆弛是改進視力最有效果的方法。現在你不妨自己試試看：除去眼睛，對著圖書或有數字的日曆坐下，暫時把眼睛輕輕地閉上，用你溫暖柔和的手掌掩蓋著兩眼，切不可壓緊，再將兩肘置在膝上或面前的桌上，使身心的到鬆弛，暫時部隊任何事思索——頭部微向兩旁轉動。於是睜眼略爲瞬睞，你會覺得你剛才所看的東西，此刻更加明亮更加淸楚了。</p>
<p>有人常常從頭到脚在緊張着，這種極度的神經過敏業影響到眼睛，這是極要不得的。而鬆弛眼睛肌肉緊張的方法便是時常　眼。所說的　眼是指眼睛輕和安靜的開閉而言，斷不可用動或浮躁。健康的眼睛是常常不自覺地迅速　著得。</p>
<p>兒童的眼睛始終是不停地輕快地陝著得，所以眼睛非常明亮，而上了年紀的或心情緊張的人，所謂目瞪，就是指眼老實固定，不自然地凝視，因而使得眼球變成模糊和不安。</p>
<p>眼足以保持眼睛的潤　，柔滑，這對於健康舒適的眼睛是必要的。所以當你運用眼睛時，使要記住不時地　眼，這是免除目瞪的好法子。</p>
<h3>地下練鋼廠</h3>
<p>— 彬之</p>
<p>戰時在我國西南邊區的岩洞中，有許多地下工廠，以防敵機轟炸，但規模是很小的。</p>
<p>自從戰爭立體化以後，各國都設法將許多工廠移到地下去，以免成爲敵機轟炸之目的物。尤其在原子彈出現後，更需要有妥善的防護。因爲工業的停滯，比在戰塲上失敗的關係更爲重大。</p>
<p>在美國開始在計劃建立大規模的地下鐵綫廠和化工廠。就鋼鐵說，在過去二十年中，美國共產生了一億噸，這是經濟和軍需的主要資源。現在計劃在烏泰州建立一座很大的地下鍊鋼廠，能在戰後兩年內，出產全國百分之一的鋼。這所工廠的建造，需要開掘五千萬立方呎的岩石，能有一片一千五百尺長的大工塲。有完善的通風設備，每分鐘能按照工塲需要供應數百噸新健空氣，有充足的水源，每分鐘能從地下吸取數千噸的淨水。這計劃的實現，估計需三千萬美元。</p>
<p>照理想，美國至少應有一半的鍊鋼廠移入地下，才能維持戰時鋼鐵的需要。那末需十五億元，並且要有五年的時間來設計。但另外問題發生了，工廠雖能隱蔽了。但廣闊的礦場還是無法避免的。現在美國百分之八十五的鐵礦，可能在戰事發生後被轟炸而生產停頓。還有運輸礦砂的鐵路，也很容易成爲敵人的目標。現在美國正爲這兩點焦慮着。</p>
<p>美國小姐</p>
<h3>美國小姐的種族偏見</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>自由平等口號喊得最響亮的國家，也就種族歧視最深刻的國家，這種族歧視除了偏見之外，還有美他牢不可拔的原因。</p>
<p>美國是人種最複雜的國家，自成系統，甚至雖毗鄰亦不相往來，除歐洲僑民與美國人的生活習慣並無太大分別外，餘如黑人的狡黠不馴，墨西哥人的放蕩懶惰，東方人的販毒走私，都足影響美國的安全與純潔。美國人的脾氣，說人家好就是好到半天，說人家壊就是壊到地獄，所以一且失信於美國人，便一輩子被他看輕。她們對於有色人種一向輕視，把有色人種列爲劣等民族，事實上自人以堅甲利兵征服大半個世界後，有色人種淪於貧苦之淵，一切都墜落了。就以有色人種中比較站得起的中國人而言，要不足與她們並論，貪汚百出的高等華人不就是有色人種的敗類嗎？你決不能怪人家有偏見。</p>
<p>她們對於中國人的知識，到底是書本和報紙上的，書本和報紙對於中國人的記述還有什麽好許？她們對墨西哥人的印象更壞，美國小姐向不和墨西哥人往還，她們並且不願意中國人和墨西哥人交往，她們常常忠吿中國男生不要和墨西哥小姐有所糾萬，她們稅墨西哥女人是最浮動的，雖然情熱時譬如烈熖，一旦變節，便成陌路。</p>
<p>她們對黑人簡直是恨如刺骨，認作毒蛇猛獸，凡有黑人居住的地方，美國人非但不再居留，甚至連那條街亦不再有白人去走，黑人在智慧上是優秀的，但在道德上確成間題，常常有黑人强姦白女之事。據一般批評，黑人非常凶淫，性發時不可遏止。黑人男女對於性慾毫無節制，你很少看到健碩的黑種少女，但是否由於淫慾過度，實難下斷語，或爲美國人故意中傷亦未可知。但美國小姐對中國留學生有相當好感，據研究結果，中國人重情，有耐心，美國小姐遇了中國男子的柔韌性她的種族偏見使被克服了。　　（十）（五）</p>

He stated: The two major groups of bandits in the Central China region are Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng, who are fleeing in the Yellow River flooded area of western Shandong and the Dabie Mountains, respectively. Their purpose is to disrupt transportation and disturb the local areas. However, due to difficulties in food supply and declining morale, the two bandits are now colluding and acting recklessly. In the future, the focus of bandit suppression in the interior will be to defeat these two groups of bandits. Liu expressed optimism about this, as the communist bandits have already lost important seaports and supplies of important materials, and their transportation lines have also been cut off. He finally pointed out: In the military aspect, it is necessary to strive for points, lines, and surfaces. However, in the political aspect, grasping the hearts of the people is extremely important.

United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Owen personally raised the United Nations flag as the ceremony of the conference. First, Philippine President Roxas delivered a speech, followed by Chiang Tingfu, the Chairman of the Conference and Chinese representative, who said: The economic problems of Asia are the fundamental problems of all problems. Eliminating the basic causes of poverty is an urgent task for all Asian countries. Within a region, no country can profit from the poverty of other countries, and the prosperity of one country is sufficient to assist other countries. The purpose of convening the Far East Economic Committee is to seek prosperity for the entire Far East region.</p>
<h3>Thailand's Qualifications Will Be Determined Today</h3>
<p>When the General Assembly holds its second meeting on the 25th, the Membership Credentials Committee will consider the qualifications of the Thai representatives.

The Asian people are not beggars seeking food door-to-door, but they demand equal treatment to overcome their difficulties. If aid to Europe is based on altruistic beliefs, then those who should be aided are the Asian people. If the purpose of aid to Europe is to prevent a certain anti-democratic torrent, then such action is even more necessary in Asia. Does assistance also have racial prejudice? However, today, the world's attention is focused on Europe, and Asia is completely overlooked. Although he did not mention the United States, his speech was aimed at the United States. He also hoped that the Economic Conference would recommend active measures to reduce tariffs and lower trade barriers to complete regional economic cooperation.</p>

<h3>Prospects for the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference</h3>
<p>The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference is scheduled to open today in London. The convening of this conference follows closely after the conclusion of the United Nations General Assembly, at a time when the European continent is turbulent and restless, and is of concern to peace-loving people around the world. The Foreign Ministers Conference originated from the Potsdam Agreement. Since the end of the war, the meeting held this time in London is the seventh. In the past six Foreign Ministers Conferences, the spirit of the Potsdam Agreement seems to have not been fully implemented, and often ad hoc measures were taken due to time and place. For example, in the Foreign Ministers Conference held in Moscow, only the three major powers participated, and China and France were absent. Later, in the meeting held in Paris, only the four major powers participated. Only the first Foreign Ministers Conference held in London was a Five-Power Foreign Ministers Conference. Looking at the past achievements, the achievements of the Foreign Ministers Conferences held in the past are not as good as generally expected. The exchange of opinions between the great powers has turned the convening of the Foreign Ministers Conference into an excellent propaganda arena for different opinions. Under this meaning of somewhat a war of nerves, the Foreign Ministers Conference seems to have somewhat lost its original meaning.</p>
<p>This Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference convened in London is a continuation of the two Foreign Ministers Conferences held in Paris and the Foreign Ministers Conferences held in New York and Moscow. Although the two Foreign Ministers Conferences convened in Paris established the Five-Nation Treaty and convened the Paris Peace Conference, they failed to reach an agreement on the German and Austrian issues. At the Fifth Foreign Ministers Conference held in New York, the German and Austrian issues were still shelved and no achievements were made. At the Sixth Foreign Ministers Conference held in Moscow, opinions became more divergent, and no concrete agreement was reached on practical German issues. Therefore, the main topics of this Foreign Ministers Conference convened in London are still the German and Austrian issues: the independence of Austria and the peace treaty with Germany. On the issue of the peace treaty with Germany, it also includes the issue of reparations, how to revive the German economy, and the issue of the German political organization. If these specific issues cannot be agreed upon, then the drafting of the peace treaty with Germany is simply a dream.</p>
<p>The issue of reparations for Germany is closely related to the issue of Germany's economic recovery. The Soviet Union wants to obtain 10 billion US dollars in compensation from Germany and is willing to use industrial production and machinery as collateral. It is questionable whether this is enough to affect Germany's economic recovery. This is also why the four powers have not been able to reach an agreement. The United Kingdom and the United States believe that although the Allied countries can demand reparations from Germany, the German people must first be able to maintain their own lives and no longer rely on foreign aid. If they are unwilling to wait for Germany's economic recovery and forcibly demand reparations, it is tantamount to demanding reparations from another Allied country. In terms of Germany's political organization, the United Kingdom and the United States advocate adopting a federal system, while the Soviet Union advocates centralized power. On these issues, there is a great difference between the views of the United Kingdom and the United States and the Soviet Union. Unless one party does not adhere to its preconceived notions and has a spirit of compromise, it seems ideal to want to reach an agreement.</p>
<p>Not to mention anything else, when the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference had not yet opened in London, the reports from the news agencies already had a strong pessimistic color. Even the agenda of the conference failed to reach an agreement. The United Kingdom, the United States, and France on the one hand, and the Soviet Union on the other, will each put forward their own agendas. On the eve of the convening of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in London, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet forces in Germany, Sokolovsky, also severely criticized Western countries at the Allied Control Council meeting. Based on all of this, the future of the London Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference does not seem optimistic. If this Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference fails to reach an agreement on the German and Austrian issues, then the iron curtain in Eastern Europe will inevitably become a new Great Wall below, and the so-called two worlds will become more obvious and real. In fact, the German people have also prepared for this final split. According to reports, German authorities estimate that if the London Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference fails and the Soviet Union drops the iron curtain, 2 million to 3 million refugees will flow from the Soviet military-occupied zone to the British and American military-occupied zones. The Soviet military-occupied zone and the British and American military-occupied zones are currently strengthening border defenses. It can be seen that if this Foreign Ministers Conference fails to achieve anything, it will inevitably have a serious impact on the situation in Europe thereafter. What we cannot forget is that in France and Italy, the recent surging labor strikes and riots may also have their reaction.</p>
<p>Indeed, as U.S. representative Dulles said at this London Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, this is truly a time for decision, a time of decisive action. What decisions will be made in London, we can only see the development of the situation thereafter. Judging from past experience, whenever a decision needs to be made, the Soviet Union may slightly change its heart, or rather, the Soviet Union may not insist too much on its views, so as to delay, and therefore, some kind of agreement may be reached. Therefore, the success or failure of this London Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference hinges on Molotov alone. However, the Soviet Union's basic position remains unchanged. Temporary delays may be one of the means to achieve its goals. On the eve of his attending the Foreign Ministers Conference in London, at a meeting of the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall frankly pointed out the Soviet Union's intentions and finally mentioned his attitude towards attending this Foreign Ministers Conference. Secretary Marshall said: "No matter how others provoke me, I will always try to avoid making statements for propaganda purposes. My purpose is to concentrate on finding a basis for an agreement to end the current deadlock and accelerate the advent of a new era of peace." Although this may be a kind of diplomatic rhetoric for diplomats, we hope that this Foreign Ministers Conference can truly find a basis for an agreement under the reefs, so that the current deadlock can be ended. The main topic is still the German and Austrian issues: the independence of Austria and the peace treaty with Germany.</p>

<h3>Admiral Towers Returns to America by Ship: He Completed the Yellow River Blocking Project; He Dedicated Half His Life to China</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] The world-renowned "Yellow River Blocking" project, whose designer and supervisor, Chief Engineer Towers (seen in the country), after completing the greatest masterpiece of his life in the past year and ten months, will leave China on the "General Gordon" on the 26th (tomorrow) to return to his hometown - California, USA. Although Mr. Towers is already sixty-seven years old, his energy is still like that of a young man in his twenties. He has never been tired of hydraulic engineering, which he has always loved in his life. He does not want to retire yet. This time he is only going back to visit his family. On the one hand, we want to thank Mr. Towers for his great contribution to China, and on the other hand, we still hope that he will return to China, where he has lived for twenty years, because China needs talents like Mr. Towers so urgently in the future.</p>
<p>Mr. Towers first came to China in 1919, when he was responsible for the field investigation of the Canal Conservancy Commission. Until 1938, his work was interrupted due to the impact of the war. In those nineteen years, Mr. Towers traveled through most of China, built many roads, organized engineering equipment for the Red Cross and other relief agencies, and overcame countless floods of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>In December 1945, Mr. Towers came to China again in the name of Chief Engineer of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), and continued to use his greatest strength to fight against the Yellow River breach. Regardless of the complexity of the political situation, and unafraid of repeated failures, he used the financial and material assistance provided by UNRRA, led 350,000 old and brave workers, and rushed to the 5,000-foot breach at Huayuankou, Henan. Finally, after spending 3.8 million man-days, 5,000 tons of UNRRA flour, 2.75 million cubic meters of earthwork, 43 million catties of sorghum stalks, 150 million catties of willow branches, 60 tons of white lead wire, 1,000 tons of native hemp rope, 2.5 million bags of UNRRA sand, 150,000 cubic meters of stone, and various machines supplied by UNRRA, this 5,000-foot breach was completely filled. And the greatest strength was the perseverance of Engineer Towers, as well as UNRRA, the Executive Yuan, our government, and the hard-working workers.</p>
<p>Today, two million mu of fertile land in the Yellow River basin have been reborn, and China can obtain an additional two million tons of food each year. More importantly, millions of compatriots in the flooded area will no longer be displaced. Mr. Towers' contribution this time will make us deeply admire him, and his enthusiasm for loving China will especially make us eternally grateful. We pay our respects to him and wish him a smooth journey!</p>
<h3>Chen Jianxin, Huang Shimin, Li Bojin: Full Text of the Judgment Reason (Part 2)</h3>
<p>And Chen Jianxin's confession after being arrested also detailed that the New Tide Society was established in the first half of the 34th year of the Republic of China and was invited to participate. Its organization had no fixed form and was increased or decreased according to needs. It had a president, Chen Jianjin, who also served as liaison, Huang Shimin as accountant, and Kuang Bojin as academic publication. Yu Zisan was responsible for liaison at Hangzhou Hui School. The distribution of other members: Peng Changhu in Nanjing, Li Zhiyan, Huang Shimin, Chen Jianxin, Xue Ximeng in Shanghai, Wang Xia and Zhao Zhikang in Taiwan, Xiang Xiewu in Wuxi, He Dakan in Changzhou, Liu Yifang in Wuxing, etc. His record of conversation on October 28 of this year:</p>
<p>Record of Conversation with Chen Jianxin</p>
<p>"Question" When did your thinking begin to lean to the left? "Answer" When I was a freshman in the Department of Agricultural Economics, I was influenced and my thinking turned to the left. "Question" What is the position and purpose of the New Tide Society? "Answer" To promote democracy and study agricultural academics. "Question" Then are all the activities of the New Tide Society concentrated on politics? "Answer" This is because some people in our organization are interested in politics. "Question" If you are interested in politics, why not be objective and adopt materials from all aspects, but specialize in collecting left-wing theoretical materials? "Answer" It is also because young people feel depressed now. "Question" Are your current activities, such as spreading reactionary poison and controlling student union representatives, completely consistent with the purpose of your New Tide Society? [Answer] This is indeed wrong. Our actions have caused some damage to the country and the nation. "Question" Now the country needs stability and society needs construction. You, as college students who are the backbone of the country, are actually heading down the path of destruction. You have received the education of the Three Principles of the People and are cultivated with public funds from the government. Are you worthy of the country? "Answer" We are indeed unworthy of the country. "Question" Since the position of the New Tide Society is incorrect and reactionary, which party's leadership did all its past activities accept? "Answer" The various activities of the New Tide Society seem to be influenced by the Communist Party invisibly, and may also turn to the Communist Party in the future. "Question" This cannot be erased with such abstract statements. Political activity is an expression of action and is by no means empty imagination. Your activities are invisibly directed by reactionary parties. Please tell us frankly. "Answer" We really have no party ties, but our activities and forms are indeed completely similar to the Communist Party. "Question" If the New Tide Society is a normal social group, why do you take the form of secret activities, and why do you have to worry about security in your announcements? "Answer" Because we ourselves have a kind of fear invisibly. The books we read are mostly left-wing. Our various activities are indeed similar to the Communist Party, so it is no wonder that it will arouse your suspicion.</p>
<p>Chen Jianxin wrote a letter of repentance on October 27 of this year, stating that Chen Jianxin came to Hangzhou and was banned, and felt that his previous behavior was uncontrolled and his thinking was wrong. From now on, he is willing to reform himself, work for the country, and seek glory for the nation.</p>
<p>Record of Conversation with Huang Shimin</p>
<p>Also, Huang Shimin's record of conversation on October 29 of this year: "Question" What is the purpose of the New Tide Society? "Answer" The purpose of the New Tide Society is to discuss academic issues with each other internally and promote democracy externally. "Question" What movements have you had? "Answer" We participated in the Minming Incident, which was a student movement in Kunming. "Question" What are the members of the New Tide Society like? "Question" Most of them sympathize with the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Record of Conversation with Li Bojin</p>
<p>Li Bojin's record of conversation on October 28 of this year: "Question" Who is the person in charge of the New Tide Society? "Answer" It is inconvenient for me to say. I don't want to implicate other classmates. "Question" Was participation in the New Tide Society proposed and passed through a meeting, or in other ways? After considering for a long time, then "Answer" Please don't press me too hard, etc. Although the words are evasive, the content is consistent with what Yu Zisan said.</p>
<p>Correspondence between members in various places</p>
<p>Moreover, Wang Xia, a member of the Taiwan branch of the society, wrote to Chen Jianxin on September 12 of this year, stating: As for the organizational issue, I think your decision is very perfect and does not need to be changed. You must be responsible for the contact. Shanghai is the center of friends' coming and going, and it is also very close to Hangzhou. Friends passing through Shanghai must report here. As for the contact, I will suggest some more opinions. I hope to write a simple report on the recent situation, occupation, residence, and mailing address of the members and send it to each friend. Because in my feeling, now the communication between friends is only with Changhu, Shimin, you, and Zisan, (omitted) but at the very least, if I have free time, I can open the mailing list and talk to each friend in a few words to increase the contact between each other. At the same time, I don't know how many new members have joined, and it seems that a simple introduction is also needed. The monthly fund is not restricted by domestic remittance, of course, there is no problem in paying it monthly. We here may be an exception, because we can only remit money to the mainland once. No matter how much you have, you can't remit it a second time within this month after one remittance. Therefore, we here have to do it this way: remit it once every three or four months, (omitted). Peng Changhu wrote to Chen Jianxin on September 11, stating: I feel that compared with the Scientific Age Society, my view of the New Society is that its nature is just as I thought, of course it cannot act at present, and it is not yet time to act, but its nature is still to act. The purpose of all work is still to promote action. (omitted) The development I am talking about is social development. Under the topic of rural areas, more friends can be absorbed, rather than the development of work. If there is no fixed goal and center, the development of the society will be very difficult, (omitted). Peng Changhu wrote to Chen Jianxin on September 30, stating: I don't have much disagreement with the assignment of personnel and forced reading, etc. What I want to ask you is another question, what do you think the society should do, that is, what should the purpose and work of the society be? My question may seem redundant, but it is actually very important. Our society is undoubtedly a group that promotes democratic movement, (omitted) Ximeng said that he does not agree with the method of reading and reporting because of safety reasons. I think this is probably not very convenient for you. People who report can write their addresses, (omitted). According to the contents of these letters, the New Tide Society is indeed engaged in secret work and is an external organization of the Communist Party, which is even more obvious.

<h3>Four Powers Discuss Treaty With Germany And Austria: Foreign Ministers Meeting Opens Today; U.S. Willing To Strive To Avoid East-West Split</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] London, 24th (broadcast): French Foreign Minister Bidault arrived in the United Kingdom at 4:20 pm today and landed at Southampton Airport. Also arriving were Foreign Secretary Mieuville and Chief Economic Advisor Alphand. French Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Gérald, arrived here yesterday.</p>
<p>[Our Own Report] London, 24th (broadcast): British Foreign Secretary Bevin visited Prime Minister Attlee at 10 Downing Street this afternoon for an hour of talks. According to well-informed sources, the two leaders discussed making a final decision on the position that the United Kingdom will take at the Foreign Ministers Meeting. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov are scheduled to visit Attlee tonight, and the French Foreign Minister is scheduled to visit tonight or tomorrow morning. This is a necessary diplomatic courtesy.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 24th] About 500 secretaries and experts from the four-power foreign ministers' delegations were busy with final arrangements today in order to open the foreign ministers' meeting here tomorrow. This meeting may be the last effort for the four countries to unanimously discuss the Treaty With Germany And Austria. After Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov arrived here by plane yesterday, the Soviet Embassy announced that Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky would be the deputy representative to assist Mr. Molotov in the discussion. Mr. Vyshinsky will come here as soon as the UN General Assembly mission is completed. Other representatives in the Soviet delegation include the commander of the Soviet forces in Germany, Sokolovsky, the Soviet ambassador to the United Kingdom, Zarubin, and the Soviet representative to the Foreign Ministers Meeting, Smirnov.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 24th] According to a Berlin report, Molotov said when he left Berlin for England yesterday that the Soviet Union has not given up hope of resolving the differences of opinion between the East and West on the German and Austrian issues through compromise.</p>
<p>[Associated Press London, 24th] Authoritative sources have learned: U.S. Secretary of State Marshall is firmly opposed to any proposal to sign a separate treaty with Germany, even if the four foreign ministers' meeting fails to reach an agreement again. According to officials close to Marshall, the proposal that Western countries should draft a treaty with Germany without the participation of the Soviet Union is close to fantasy. This proposal ignores the facts and is inconsistent with the basic daily goals of U.S. policy. A separate peace with Germany will permanently split Europe, and U.S. policy should ultimately lead to the reunification of Europe to restore its centuries-old appearance.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 23rd] Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber and Ambassador to the Soviet Union Walter Brunner arrived in London from Vienna today. The first batch of Austrian representatives arrived in England earlier.</p>
<h3>U.S. Senate Debates Emergency Aid To Europe Bill; Vandenberg Urges Approval; Bridges Still Opposes</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] New York, 24th (broadcast): Washington report, U.S. Senate President Vandenberg left his seat as chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee today and first began debating the emergency aid to Italy, Austria, and Greece, arguing that Congress should quickly approve the $795 million emergency appropriation to prevent the continued spread of communism. He said that in the United Nations organization, the new aggressive forces are using veto power to obstruct matters and force their attached countries to follow suit. In Europe, a minority of countries are creating chaos through strikes and other improper activities in order to promote the rise of communism.</p>
<p>Vandenberg said: The Soviet Union is working hard to make the U.S. aid to Europe plan fail. The U.S. must catch up quickly in order to stabilize Europe so that the "final conflict" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union will not really happen. Mr. Vandenberg urged to accelerate the passage of the president's aid to Europe plan, but he expressed his regret that the president mixed the prevention of inflation with aid to Europe, believing that this would cause "wrong reactions" among the people.</p>
<p>[Our Own Report] New York, 24th (broadcast): Washington report, the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee met today to examine the impact of U.S. aid to Europe on domestic food issues. Committee Chairman Bridges said that President Truman's request to implement rationing and control prices is an infringement of Congress's power, and said that the president's emergency aid to Europe plan is still a "blank check." It is believed that U.S. emergency aid to France, Italy, and Austria may cause a serious food shortage in the U.S. It is reported that Truman has assured Congress that if the U.S. agricultural harvest is poor next year, the food transported to Europe can be reduced.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 24th] Congress officially began discussing Truman's aid to Europe and preventing domestic price increases plan today. The Senate is preparing to discuss the emergency aid to France, Italy, and Austria case at noon. The case is expected to be passed on Wednesday night.</p>

<h3>French New Cabinet Formed In Haste: De Gaulle's Faction Has Been Strengthened; Nine-Tenths Of National Railways Are Shut Down</h3>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 24th] The Schumann cabinet held its first meeting on the afternoon of the 24th to discuss plans to deal with the threat of a general strike.

The Communist Party's "Tonight" Evening News criticized the new cabinet for sacrificing the Socialist Party, allowing the Popular Republican Movement to take the lead, and increasing De Gaulle's power in the government. The new Finance Minister, Meville, is considered a follower of De Gaulle.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 24th] Nine-tenths of all railways in France have been shut down due to strikes. Ports and most coal mines across the country are affected by labor unrest, and schools in Paris are also closed.</p>

<h3>Italy Prepares To Form Coalition Cabinet: Two Moderate Left-Wing Parties Express Willingness To Cooperate; Italian Republican Left-Wing Party Expresses Willingness To Cooperate</h3>
<p>[United Press Rome, 23rd] Two moderate left-wing parties hinted today that they may be immediately prepared to join Prime Minister Gasperi's Christian Democratic government. One of the two parties is the Republican Party led by Baziatis, which is small in scale but has hope, and the other is the Socialist Workers' Party led by Saragat, which broke away from the pro-communist Socialist Party led by Nanni eight months ago.</p>
<p>A joint communique from the two parties stated, "The two parties have decided to jointly review the conditions for shifting the government's axis to the left, guaranteeing democratic freedom, protecting public security and peace, prohibiting the resurrection of the fascist movement, and finding ways to solve the most urgent economic problems." Afterwards, Baziatis told the press that this move meant that we were prepared to start organizing a government to deal with the current difficult situation under the best conditions. Ba. proposed a conditional temporary cooperation plan until the elections in March next year to save the Christian Democratic Party from the anti-republican alliance and the critical situation.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Rome, 23rd] In its continued war against the government, the Italian Communist Party seems to have shifted its strategy from street bloodshed to demanding that Italian workers control Italian industry. Some sources said that the reason why the political riot ended was that it clearly could not force the government to resign, let alone create a large-scale massacre of workers to be used for propaganda.</p>
<h3>Japanese War Criminals Conspire To Seize Power: Allied Headquarters Discovers Huge Secret Organization</h3>
<p>[Reuters Tokyo, 24th] Although Japan seems to be moving towards democracy on the surface, revolutionary forces are brewing to overthrow all the reforms made by the occupying authorities after the withdrawal of the occupying forces, and then seize power.</p>
<p>Important officials in MacArthur's headquarters have unanimously agreed that the existence of this dangerous force is more closely organized and widespread than the anti-British and American Black Dragon Society before the war. In fact, it is equivalent to a "secret government." It is believed that this organization reaches all parts of Japan, with an important figure in charge of everything, and a ten-member committee is responsible for promoting it. Most of these important personnel come from the purged military and chaebol classes, and their lower-level staff are all over the place. The central idea of ​​these people is extreme nationalism. However, it is a very difficult task to determine the names of these people, because their actions are secretive, and even people in the circle do not know who is responsible for them. However, it has been confirmed by MacArthur's headquarters that anyone who participates in this organization must take a blood oath, and other things are still under investigation. In the most recent weeks, two members of the organization have been arrested.</p>
<p>Nishio Said He Has Not Heard Of It</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 24th] According to a Reuters telegram, a widespread underground movement has recently occurred in Japan. The so-called "underground government" threatens Japan's reforms based on the occupation policy. It is generally believed that this underground organization was naturally formed by the chaos at the end of the war, and cannot be eliminated until economic stability is restored. Also, a certain official in Japan said that this "secret underground government" was organized by former Japanese army and navy officers. Chief Nishio said in this regard: I don't believe that there is a secret political organization in Japan. The government has not heard of this. It is undeniable that former army and navy officers are dissatisfied with the current state of political unrest, but there is currently no so-called secret government organization and strength. In the local black markets, there are those who have power and want to expand their scope by violence, but this does not have any political power.</p>
<h3>Dispersion of Economy and Supplementary Budget Bills: Both Passed By Japanese House of Representatives; Coal Mine Bill Also Passed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo, 24th] The House of Representatives passed the bill to disperse economic power and the supplementary budget bill yesterday over the opposition of the Liberal Party and the Communist Party. At least more than 300 large-scale enterprises in Japan will be affected by this bill to disperse economic power, because these large companies and factories will be divided into smaller parts in accordance with this bill.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 24th] It is expected that the Coal Mine Nationalization Bill will be successfully passed as planned, except for the major chaos that occurred in the meeting place again, and the first draft of the so-called "socialist policy" will be born, followed by the "socialization" bills for agriculture and various industries will also be submitted one after another to complete the legislative process.</p>
<h3>Matsui Ishigen Attempts To Shirk Responsibility</h3>
<p>Defends The Nanjing Massacre Case Vigorously</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 24th] The Far East International Tribunal continued to interrogate Japanese war criminals today. Defendant Matsui defended the Nanjing Massacre, saying that it was far from the truth to say that the Japanese military staff headquarters ordered or condoned the massacre of Chinese people during the battle for Nanjing. I have always been known as a friend of China and have tried my best to advocate Sino-Japanese friendship. In 1937, I hurriedly took command and led the expeditionary force. Throughout the battles of Shanghai and Nanjing, I always instructed my subordinates to protect Chinese culture and history and encourage Chinese civilians to stay at home to avoid causing hostility towards Japan.</p>

<h3>Bank's Sale Under Fire for Alleged Fraud: Police Summon Lin Peizhong</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Bachuan Bank at 731 Nanjing East Road, currently undergoing liquidation, has recently been accused of fraud in connection with the sale of its assets. Zhou Xincheng, a local resident of Lane 516, No. 514 Xin Dagu Road, filed a complaint with the police, alleging that Lin Peizhong and Peng Qicao, the persons in charge of the bank's liquidation, colluded to commit fraud and conceal assets. After receiving the complaint, the police department immediately summoned Lin and Peng for questioning by the Criminal Investigation Division. However, only Lin Peizhong appeared yesterday and denied all the allegations made by the complainant. According to Zhou's original complaint, he was introduced by Feng Xuanling, a bank employee, to Lin Peizhong, the liquidator of Bachuan Bank, on the 16th of this month, to negotiate the purchase of the bank's premises and all its assets for a price of 1.5 billion yuan. They agreed to finalize the deal on the 18th. However, Lin suddenly reneged on the agreement on the due date. Despite repeated urging, no results were obtained. Zhou subsequently learned that the bank had sold the assets to the New Continent Company at a lower price of over 1.3 billion yuan, which constituted a breach of trust, fraud, and concealment of assets. He requested an investigation.</p>

After the interrogation, they were ordered to each provide a family surety.</p>
<h3>Sunken Ship Located Using Radar:</h3>
<p>*Yanghai Maru* to be towed by *Hai Dian* in coming days</p>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Mainland Steamship Company purchased a Japanese ship, *Yanghai Maru*, salvaged by Hong Kong authorities, last month in Hong Kong. They entrusted the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to dispatch the *Ji An* rescue ship to tow it to Shanghai. It repeatedly took shelter from storms in Xiamen. It continued its northward journey on the 15th of this month. However, the wind and waves became more severe on the sea off Fuzhou. To protect the *Ji An*, the *Yanghai Maru* was anchored at sea, and the *Ji An* sailed to Baiquan Island to take temporary shelter from the gale. The wind and waves subsided slightly the day before yesterday, and the *Ji An* immediately sailed back to the sea to search for the *Yanghai Maru*. Unexpectedly, the ship was attacked by wind and waves, and the hull was damaged, gradually sinking, rendering the search unsuccessful. An electrical message to search was also ineffective. Later, a US transport ship assisted in locating it with radar, and the *Ji An* rescued it. It has now been secured by *Hai Dian* and taken to Xiamen. The *Ji An* sustained slight damage and returned to Shanghai after minor repairs. *Yanghai Maru* is expected to be towed to Shanghai by *Hai Dian* in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Bandit Caught Red-Handed with Loot: Readily Surrenders</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] On the 17th of this month, the Xujiahui Police Precinct received a tip that a notorious bandit was hiding in a shantytown in the Pingmin Village on Hongqiao Road. Precinct Chief Song Anmin immediately ordered Judicial Section Chief Yuan Jie, accompanied by officers, to proceed secretly to the location. They apprehended Xin Wenshen, who confessed under strict interrogation to having conspired to rob property from No. 85 Tangzi Jing. He revealed that his accomplice, Xu Shilan, was hiding in a shantytown in Yaojiazhai. Officers were immediately dispatched to the location, where they caught two bandits, Xu Mingtang and Wang Xueshan, red-handed as they returned from robbing two trunks filled with belongings from No. 653, Zuo Jia Lane, No. 442, West Linsen Road. A six-inch pistol was also confiscated. The suspects were taken to the precinct for strict interrogation. With the investigation completed, the precinct transferred the four bandits to the District Procuratorate for questioning.</p>
<h3>Carpenter Secretly Reports Corruption in Receiving Property</h3>
<p>Court Holds Preliminary Hearing for Two Customs Officials: Serious Circumstances Warrant Further Investigation</p>
<p>[Our Reporter] Ding Guitang, Deputy Inspector General of the Jianghai Customs; Liu Gongyun, former Director of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Handling Bureau; Chen Shouzhi, Section Chief of the Nuclear Award Section; Wu Rencang, Director of the China Industrial and Mining Corporation; Lu Shishang, former Chief of the Material Group of the Third Front Army; Customs officials Huang Guojie, Lin Xuequ, He Hengshan; and Deputy Inspector General Qian Zongqi (a total of nine people) were secretly accused by Sun Zhuting, Zhu Shengyao, and Cao Haishen at the end of last year to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, alleging corruption in the receipt of a large quantity of pig iron and iron ingots stored in the warehouse of the enemy property Ruichang Hardware Store. After the case was referred to the local District Procuratorate for investigation, it was determined that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Ding, Liu, Chen, and Wu. Lu Shishang, being an active-duty military officer, should be investigated by a military organ. Huang, Lin, He, and Qian were prosecuted for embezzlement. Yesterday afternoon, the case was heard in the Second Criminal Division of the District Court by Presiding Judge Wu Xiangzu. The defendants Qian Zongqi, who is now in Brazil, and He Hengshan, who is also not in Shanghai, did not appear in court. The informer Sun Zhuting first testified that he was a carpenter and had worked in the warehouse for over a week at the end of 1945, during which he learned of the corruption. There were a total of over 2,000 tons of pig iron, weighed by Lin Xuequ, but only 912.5 tons were reported on the inventory list. Lin Xuequ testified that although he weighed the pig iron, there were only 912.5 tons, of which 127 tons were wrapped in straw mats, each roll weighing 58 kilograms, totaling 2,195 rolls. The rest were in bulk. Huang Guojie testified that he handled the receipt of the materials on December 11, 1945, totaling 912.5 tons of pig iron and 408 iron pipes, and completed the inventory list on January 8, 1946, sending it to the Enemy Property Handling Bureau and the Third Front Army for signature. Finally, their defense lawyers Jiang Yiping and Li Gengxiang made their statements and submitted the original inventory list for review. The court ordered that the case was of great importance and required further investigation, adjourning the hearing to a later date. The two defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Plotting Escape, Resorting to Arson at Reformatory: Four Women of Loose Morals Conclude Trial, Sentencing Scheduled</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Dong Acui, Wang Jinxiang, and Wu Yueying, all women from Ningbo who had previously worked as unlicensed prostitutes, and Tang Xiaomei, who attempted suicide by drowning, were detained at the Shanghai Women's Reformatory at No. 602 Taixing Road after being arrested by the police. Due to their loose morals and unfamiliarity with reformatory life, they repeatedly attempted to escape, but to no avail. At 4:00 PM on the 28th of last month, Tang Xiaomei suddenly proposed setting fire to the reformatory in order to take advantage of the chaos to escape. Dong and the others applauded the suggestion, praising it as a "good idea."</p>
<p>After careful discussion, at 8:50 PM that evening, Wu Yueying secretly took tinder, straw mats, and other flammable materials into the matchbox storage room to start the fire. Dong Acui, Wang Jinxiang, and Tang Xiaomei stood guard outside. Soon, thick smoke filled the area. Dong and the others, seeing that the plan had succeeded, attempted to flee together. Fortunately, the fire was discovered early, and the reformatory staff bravely extinguished the blaze. Apart from a slightly burned empty matchbox, no major disaster occurred. Dong and the other four were apprehended and transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation. Dong and the others confessed to setting the fire. The District Procuratorate prosecuted them under Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The case was heard yesterday morning at 10:00 AM in the Eighth Criminal Division of the District Court by Judge Xie Zhiying. The complainant, Chen Nianci (reformatory administrator), did not appear and was represented by another administrator, Zhang Qingkun, who testified that he indeed saw the defendants starting the fire upstairs on the day in question. Two other women in the reformatory, Ding AE and Lin Cuiying, both testified that they witnessed Wu Yueying hiding the tinder at 7:45 PM. Defendant Dong Acui stated that she carried a bundle of grass paper and went upstairs with the other three defendants, where Wu Yueying started the fire. However, the other three defendants denied the above facts. The court ordered the conclusion of the debate in the case and scheduled the sentencing for the morning of the 1st of next month.</p>
<h3>English Princess's Wedding Photo: Features Barely Recognizable</h3>
<p>·Arrived after multiple transmissions via international radio·</p>
<p>[Our Reporter] Princess Elizabeth of England married Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten in London on the 20th of this month. On the 22nd, the Shanghai *North-China Daily News* featured a picture of them taken during the wedding ceremony. The caption indicated that it was a radiophoto from the Associated Press. This photograph aroused a great deal of interest. On the one hand, everyone was impressed by the speed of the transmission, but on the other hand, they felt that the result was not ideal, as the facial features of the two people in the image were so distorted that they were almost unrecognizable.</p>
<p>The reason for the blurriness of the photograph is that it was not transmitted directly from London to Shanghai, but from London to New York, from New York to San Francisco, and then from San Francisco to Shanghai. After so many transfers, differences had already emerged by the time it passed through San Francisco.</p>
<p>Old Equipment, Poor Results</p>
<p>How did the Associated Press obtain this photograph? In fact, the international radio station of the Ministry of Communications in the Sassoon House received this radiophoto. The international radio station contacted San Francisco on the night of the 20th. The weather conditions at the time were very suitable for transmitting radiophotos. When they inquired again at 5:53 AM on the 21st, the weather was still good. The first photograph was transmitted at this time, but it was extremely blurry. Therefore, they requested San Francisco to transmit it again, and the second photograph was received at 6:15 AM.</p>
<p>Wireless radiophoto transmission is not a new invention. During China's War of Resistance, Kunming had such equipment. The equipment currently at the international radio station was brought back from Kunming. Because the equipment is old, it was in the testing phase. The poor quality of the Princess of England's photo was mainly due to the old equipment. Recently, the international radio station has ordered a new set of equipment from the United States, which has arrived in the city. Once import procedures are completed, it can be installed, and the radiophoto business will officially open around the end of the year.</p>
<p>Equipped with Transmissions to America</p>
<p>The international radio station also has equipment that has not received attention and has therefore not been fully utilized. This equipment involves McCormick, the head of the *Chicago Tribune*. After McCormick's visit to China this time, he never expressed his views on China. However, McCormick did broadcast to the United States twice at the international radio station on the 14th and 20th of this month. McCormick used the international radio station's "Program Transmission Service" to broadcast to the United States from Shanghai. The broadcasts from Shanghai were relayed by RCA Wireless Radio Company in the United States to various broadcasting companies in the United States, and then distributed to radio stations nationwide, allowing the entire United States to listen.</p>
<p>This equipment existed before the war and was restored last year after the victory. However, to date, only a few foreign reporters have come to broadcast. The international radio station believes that government agencies such as the Central News Agency's International Propaganda Office could make greater use of this equipment as a tool for foreign propaganda.</p>
<p>[Our Reporter] The National Assembly regional elections began counting ballots yesterday at the Municipal Council. At 9:00 AM sharp, Mayor Wu personally presided over the opening ceremony of the ballot counting. The ceremony was simple and orderly. In his address, the Mayor said that the ballot counting was an important key to constitutional government, and that we should learn the new process of democratic politics, hoping that everyone would take the matter seriously. After the address, the ballot boxes were opened and counted under the supervision of the senators. In addition to the 45 administrators, 12 employees of the Civil Affairs Bureau were temporarily transferred to work in groups. With a full day of effort, a total of 130,474 ballots were counted, of which 940 were invalid. As of 6:30 PM, when the ballot counting ended, the candidates with more votes were as follows: Qian Dajun 938 votes, Pan Gongzhan 6,894 votes, Liu Weichi 9,360 votes, Fang Zhi 3,496 votes, Jin Zhenyu 1,087 votes, Jiang Huaisu 10,821 votes, Wang Zikui 13,730 votes, Mao Zifeng 1,117 votes, Chen Qitian 1,154 votes, Jin Houcheng 1,013 votes, Xie Qingbai 1,065 votes, Zheng Ziliang 993 votes, Jin Jiulin 4,491 votes, Du Yuesheng 15,211 votes, Gu Jinzao 4,033 votes, Xu Liang 4,318 votes, Lu Yinggeng 3,517 votes, Yin Zhiling 21,194 votes, Qian Xinzhi 10,623 votes. The number of ballots counted yesterday accounted for only one-seventh of all ballots, and the ballots counted were arbitrarily selected, possibly biased towards several districts. Therefore, the results obtained are not sufficient to represent the overall situation of the general election. Ballot counting will continue from this morning. Due to technical difficulties in the ballot counting, the current manpower is insufficient to cope with the situation. It has been decided to increase five groups from today, together with the original eight groups, for a total of thirteen groups for ballot counting.</p>
<h3>Newspaper Reporters as Spectators</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The professional group elections began counting ballots at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday without any ceremony. Mayor Wu arrived at the venue around 9:00 AM and first instructed Chen Boliang, director of the ballot counting office, to read out the "Detailed Rules for Ballot Counting" and the "Criteria for Determining Invalid Ballots" to the 25 ballot counters. During the reading process, a representative of the department store workers' union presented a piece of paper requesting a title for the union's "inaugural issue of a special publication." The Mayor happily obliged. Then, the Mayor personally opened the ballot box of the fourth polling station of the labor union group with a key and removed the seals. The ballot counting work then began. The Mayor repeatedly instructed everyone to take the matter seriously and then left. The atmosphere inside the venue was solemn. The supervisory personnel did not all attend. Newspaper reporters and several candidates who came to the venue to observe were all barred from the second floor as spectators.</p>
<p>Hundred Ballots Stacked Like Banknotes</p>
<p>There were a total of 54 ballot boxes, all sealed horizontally and vertically. Due to manpower and time constraints yesterday, only a portion of the farmers' association, fishermen's association, labor union, and industrial and mining groups were opened. After the ballots were extracted, they were not read aloud. Instead, the ballot counters sorted them by the method of counting banknotes, stacking them in piles of 100. The supervisors then checked the total number. In the future, all ballots will be sent to Nanjing for national statistics, except for those from local groups. The opened ballots must still be sealed in boxes for six months for legal verification.</p>
<h3>Ballots with Simplified Characters or Homophones Not Deemed Invalid</h3>
<p>Very few ballots were deemed invalid among those opened yesterday. Half of them were blank ballots. Others were region election ballots mistakenly cast in the occupational group ballot boxes, or ballots with erasures, which were invalidated according to law. As for ballots with candidate names written in simplified characters or homophones, they were not deemed invalid this time. The results of yesterday's ballot counting have not yet been fully tallied. Among those already tallied, Ye Xianggao topped the list with 35,170 votes in the labor union sector.</p>
<h3>Meeting to Review Technical Gains and Losses</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The heads of the civil affairs sections of the city's district offices met yesterday to review the technical gains and losses of the electoral campaign. They all advocated that for the Legislative Yuan elections, national identification cards should be used instead of voter registration certificates to obtain ballots. If this cannot be done, they hope to reissue voter registration certificates to citizens. They also advocated that the voter registration list be revised based on the voters who voted in the National Assembly elections, and that the list be publicly announced in advance. Those who do not object within the deadline should be deemed to have waived their right to vote. Chen Minshu, head of the Regional Election Section, said that the implementation of this suggestion would have three major benefits: 1. the procedures would be simple, 2. there would be no duplication of voting rights, and 3. with national identification cards to claim voting rights, there would be no impersonation. However, there are currently two difficulties: first, how to ensure that national identification cards are widely obtained, and second, under the new method, regional voters and occupational group voters cannot be separated, which would cause administrative inconvenience. The above opinions will be compiled into recommendations and submitted to the central government for approval and implementation.</p>
<h3>Treatment Methods, Approaches, and Active Measures - Typographical Errors Are All Considered Invalid Votes</h3>
<p>During yesterday's vote counting, a large number of invalid ballots were discovered. Besides blank ballots and altered ballots, the most common errors involved mistaking Fang Zhi (方治) for "Fang Zhi" (方治), "Fang Fa" (方法, meaning "method"), "Fang Hao" (方浩), and "Fang Huo" (方活). Secondly, there were errors where Pseudo-Fan Gongzhan (僞藩公展) was mistaken for "Fan Gongzhan" (藩公展) and "Fan Gongzhan" (藩公展), and Qian Xin Zhi's (錢新之) writing was mistaken for "Qian Yongming" (錢永銘). In addition, there were many invalid ballots selecting individuals who were not candidates. Among these, Chairman Chiang received a particularly notable number of votes, it is said.</p>

<h3>Xiang Sheng Taxi Company Car Encounters Robbery Again</h3>
<p>Driver is Alert, Losses are Small</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] At 11:25 PM on the 23rd, a person wearing a short black overcoat and yellow uniform went to the Sixth Branch of the Xiansheng Taxi Company on Xizang South Road to rent a car. Driver Du Meichang (杜美昌) was instructed to drive car number 20438 to transport the passenger. When the car reached the intersection of Fuxing Middle Road and Taoyuan Road, the passenger asked the driver to stop. Another person, wearing the same clothing as the first, jumped out from beside a nearby power line pole, boarded the car, and told Du to drive to Zhongshan Hospital near Fenglin Bridge. Du noticed that the two people were behaving strangely and became suspicious. He drove to the Xiansheng Fourteenth Branch on Lin Sen Middle Road near Shaanxi South Road, feigned a reason to get out of the car, and entrusted the eleven thousand yuan in cash and a wristwatch to the company for safekeeping before getting back in the car to drive. Unexpectedly, when the car reached Fuxing Middle Road via Shaanxi South Road, one passenger suddenly pulled out a pistol and threatened Du while the other passenger drove. When the car reached Taiyuan Road on Xujiahui Road, the area was deserted. They stopped the car and searched Du, only finding American dollars, a five-cent American coin, and a flashlight. The two became disappointed and drove to Yongnian Road, turning onto Zhongzheng South Second Road, attempting to rob passengers on passing pedicabs, but gave up due to the passengers not being wealthy. Later, they drove the car to near the Police Club on Shaoxing Road, intending to rob pedestrians, but were dissuaded by the other passenger, who told them not to act rashly, fearing military police ahead. They then drove the car back towards the Cathay Theatre, telling Du to drive. When they reached Chengdu Road, they threatened Du not to report the incident to the police before jumping out and fleeing without a trace. Du reported the incident to the New City Police Station, requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3>Police Chief Orders Investigation into Car Owner Who Intimidated Patrol Officer</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] In the case of Xu Xinqin (徐心芹), an editor at the Central Daily News, suffering a broken arm when the taxi she was riding in was hit by license plate 13352, Zhao Chongshi (趙崇士), the owner of vehicle 13352, intimidated Patrol Officer Song (宋) from the Huangpu Branch who was dispatched to investigate the accident scene, saying loudly, "Commander Guan is my friend, Yu Shuping (兪叔平) is my student, and Zhang Shi (張師) is my old subordinate." When reporters inquired with Police Chief Yu Shuping, Yu firmly denied knowing Zhao Chongshi and said that it was clearly an act of deception and bragging. He had instructed the Huangpu Branch to investigate thoroughly. Yu also indicated that since the branch had already dispatched a patrol officer to investigate the scene of the accident, the branch would submit a report to the headquarters for further handling.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, This Newspaper, 22nd] Chairman Wang Maogong (王懋功), who had just returned yesterday from Xuzhou after discussing suppression matters, received local and out-of-town reporters in the provincial capital on the 22nd. Because his remarks are aimed at awakening the awareness of the people of Jiangsu, the reporter has recorded the main points of Wang's conversation as follows:</p>
<p>Since returning from Xuzhou, I know that everyone is eager to know everything about Xuzhou. I will now explain in three points:</p>
<p>The military situation in northern Jiangsu: Since Liu Bocheng (劉伯誠) followed Chen Yi (陳毅) and Chen Geng (陳賡) into the Dabie Mountains, attempting to establish a base area to disrupt our military heartland, following the example of Sui Ning (睢寗), they have now reinforced their forces to seven columns, successively capturing Pei County, Xiao County, and Dangshan, and threatening Xuzhou. The situation is tense. Therefore, I made the trip to Xuzhou. Everyone should know that Xuzhou is the gateway to Jiangsu and the northern gate of the capital, with great control over the military situation in Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui. I went to Xuzhou and instructed the commissioners and county magistrates on the proper way to suppress the bandits. After staying in Xuzhou for a day, I can say that I am a little more at ease about Xuzhou. I discussed with Commander-in-Chief Gu (顧) to ensure that military and political efforts are coordinated and that the affected areas receive relief. For example, during the battle of Dangshan, all senior party and government officials in the city heroically sacrificed their lives, with only the county magistrate escaping. The self-defense forces also suffered heavy losses. All city defense works were completely destroyed. The tragic situation is beyond description. Xiao and Pei counties also fell into the hands of the bandits once, and all food and clothing were completely burned and destroyed. Therefore, all follow-up matters must be handled properly.</p>
<p>Regarding the defense of Xuzhou: Xuzhou is the northern gate of the capital and is related to the safety of 30 million people in the 36 counties of northern Jiangsu and the neighboring counties of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui. Therefore, it is extremely important to strengthen the defense of Xuzhou. Recently, with the return of Commander-in-Chief Gu, the people of Xuzhou have become more stable, and I believe that the fleeing bandits will suffer a crushing defeat. Recently, there are no traces of bandits within 100 li of Xuzhou. Our victory is certainly not in doubt. In less than two months, the bandits have twice raided, with forces of seven or eight columns each time, attempting to move around in northern Jiangsu. If the bandit Liu is not destroyed, we will continue to suffer. The best way to deal with this is to strengthen the defense of Xuzhou to consolidate the outskirts of the capital, protect northern Jiangsu, and establish a military center for Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui. Commander-in-Chief Gu and I both agree that this issue is extremely important. However, Xuzhou was occupied for eight years during the War of Resistance, and has been repeatedly harassed by communist bandits since the victory. The central government has taken into account the poverty of Xuzhou and has allocated 1.4 billion yuan to establish the defense of Xuzhou. In fact, the defense line of Xuzhou is as long as 140 li, requiring 20 billion yuan. After discussing with Commander-in-Chief Gu, he also confirmed that the people of Jiangsu are suffering, and plans to request the central government to allocate another 10 billion yuan, and to raise 20 billion yuan from the business community in Xuzhou. It has been agreed that the Huadong Coal Mining Company will donate 10 billion yuan. The price of flour will be increased by 20,000 yuan per bag, which will raise 45 billion yuan. Banks will donate 3 billion or 2 billion yuan, with the minimum being 1 billion yuan, totaling more than 30 billion yuan. Each bag of flour will be increased by 20,000 yuan, which will raise about 10 billion yuan. There are also goods stranded in Xuzhou, and discussions are underway with the railway bureau to handle them on behalf of the owners, which will also raise a sum of money. In order to raise funds, I asked for assistance from all sectors in Xuzhou and explained to the people of all sectors that I could take responsibility for requesting the central government to give Xuzhou supreme glory together with Commander Gu. What made me most grateful was that when the numbers were presented at the time, they were all happy to donate, which shows that they still have confidence in me and are fully aware of the importance of Xuzhou. I very much hope that our Jiangsu—especially Jiangnan—will emulate this spirit, and that the city defenses of the Yangtze River, the lake defenses of Taihu Lake, and the city defenses of various counties will be firmly established. For your own lives and property, when the communist bandits come, they will rob the assets of the rich, burn your land and houses, and even kill your lives. We have to do the math. For all of our lives and property, we should contribute a small part of our property. I hope you (referring to the reporters) will publicize this point more. This is a worthwhile thing. I am ordered by the central government, and of course I am equal to the housekeeper of this province. I also have a pair of hands and a pair of feet, but when the bandits come, you are still playing cards, drinking, and living a drunken life. I should remind you to stop playing cards and drinking, and quickly distribute work to protect yourself.</p>
<p>I will also report on a little bit about the six-province joint defense conference. The six-province joint defense conference was held in Nanjing very secretly, so the news media in the capital knew nothing about it. Here is a simple report to everyone on the results of the discussion: Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei have been divided into military regions to implement all military measures. Local self-defense teams must be properly organized by the end of November. Organize an intelligence network, and all towns and villages should complete all their telephone networks by December 25. Establish household registration and Baojia system to prevent bandits from entering. Township heads who are double-dealers will be killed without mercy. As for Jiangsu, it has been divided into military districts, with Jiangnan as a garrison area and Jiangbei as a pacification area, so everything is a military system. When necessary, military law may replace the judiciary, and ordinary laws cannot restrain the strategy of bandit suppression. The most hateful thing is the scattered bandits and so-called underground personnel in Jiangnan. I have ordered all counties to clear the scattered bandits by the end of November. If there are still bandits in a certain place, only the township heads and commissioners will be questioned. If there are bandits between villages, the county magistrate is responsible. If there are bandits between counties, the commissioner is responsible. In this way, the previous situation of ineffective joint defense can be prevented. At the same time, I have also informed all counties along the river in Jiangbei to urge the self-defense teams to prevent communist bandits from crossing the river to the south. The ships in Jiangbei also have a ship management office to manage them. The necessary crossings should be closed, and ferries must be inspected. Every time communist bandits arrive, they must collect people, food, clothing, etc. We should be especially prepared for this. All materials and non-combatants must be moved to safe areas in a planned manner in case of emergency. (Reporters from This Newspaper, He Xianglin)</p>
<h3>Thorough Reissuance of National Identity Cards - Township and Village Chiefs Must Not Be Careless</h3>
<p>National identity cards in all counties of Jiangsu Province will be reissued uniformly according to the formats issued by the ministry. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has instructed all counties to complete the reissuance by the end of this year. During the reissuance, a thorough investigation should be conducted first, and the cards should only be issued to those who are indeed law-abiding. If there are any omissions that lead to the cards being used by undesirable elements, the township and village chiefs in charge will be punished as if they were aiding the communists.</p>

<h3>Sixty-Seven Japanese and Ryukyuan Smugglers Awaiting Repatriation</h3>
<p>[Airmail Dispatch from Taipei, This Newspaper, 22nd] A reporter visited the First Precinct of the City Police Department yesterday to interview the detained Japanese and Ryukyuan prisoners. According to Director Li (李) of the precinct, in addition to the more than forty people who were transferred to the Provincial Police Department for forced repatriation some days ago, there are currently sixty-seven people, most of whom smuggled to Taiwan. The Japanese and Ryukyuans have not been able to forget Taiwan. Because they cannot live in their own country, they risk their lives to smuggle to Taiwan, hoping to make a profit. There are also some who are acting for other purposes. However, the police局 has no legal provisions to punish or employ them other than detaining them and sending them back to their home countries.</p>

<h3>Chen Jianxin, Huang Shimin, and Li Bojin: Full Text of the Reasoning for the Verdict</h3>
<p>(Continued from the second page)</p>
<p>In summary, the defendants were all members of the New Tide Society, and the New Tide Society was an external organization of the Communist Party. It strived for representation in student self-governance organizations at all levels within Zhejiang University, participated in the All-China Student Federation led by the Chinese Communist Party, and engaged in various secret activities such as instigating student movements, recruiting members, circulating left-wing medical reports, and producing reading reports. It can be determined that the defendants participated in the Communist Party and took on the role of logistical planning. The defendants' defense in this court that the New Tide Society was an academic group with no connection to the Communist Party, and that the Communist Party's New Tide Society was a separate organization, is inconsistent with their recorded statements. The various activities of the New Tide Society seemed to be unconsciously influenced by the Communist Party, and it was said that in the future, they might turn to the Communist Party, and that the determination of our activities and forms was completely similar to the Communist Party. Furthermore, if the New Tide Society had no connection with the Communist Party, why was it not registered as an academic group with the government and schools, and why was it working secretly, constantly worrying about safety? As for the certificate presented from the Training Department of Zhejiang University, proving that Chen Jianxin, Huang Shimin, and others founded the New Tide Wall Newspaper in the Meitan branch of Zhejiang University in the spring of the 34th year, and registered with the Training Department of Zhejiang University, regardless of whether the certificate was given on a temporary basis, its evidentiary power is weak. Moreover, it is a certificate for the New Tide Wall Newspaper, which is only a part of the New Tide Society's work activities, and is a separate matter from the entire New Tide Society. Even if it was indeed registered with Zhejiang University, it is only limited to the New Tide Wall Newspaper being posted at Zhejiang University, with permission obtained, and cannot include the New Tide Society distributed in various places as having obtained legal registration. Furthermore, according to the defense, Yu Zisan's recorded statement on October 29 of this year was fingerprinted, but since Yu Zisan is dead, there is no way to verify it, and the authenticity is beyond doubt. According to the recorded statement, fingerprints were also affixed to the recorded statement, but Yu Zisan and each of the defendants also signed and affixed their fingerprints on the recorded statements of the 25th of the same month. Furthermore, Yu Zisan's signature has been verified and is consistent with his recorded statement of October 25 of this year and the attached inventory of personally claimed items (Evidence No. 50), and it cannot be said that there are any flaws to hastily accuse the record of being untrue. Furthermore, although Chen Jianxin refused to sign the recorded statement of October 28 of this year, the content of his statements was mostly evasive, revealing the truth. How can one expect to escape responsibility simply because he did not sign? Furthermore, since the defendants engaged in secret activities and provided support, they cannot obstruct their crimes by claiming that the deadline for applying to register to withdraw from the Communist Party has not yet passed. The Communist Party's armed disturbances in North China and Northeast China are aimed not only at seizing power, but also at destroying all organizations of the country. It is clearly attempting to undermine the national system, seize territory, change the constitution by illegal means, subvert the government, and implement its rear-end close-lying Communist Party members who incite student and worker movements, as well as all reactionary work, disrupt social order, and echo remotely, which is its entire plan to harm the Republic of China. Based on this judgment, although the defendants engaged in secret activities in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places, since they have a connection of criminal intent with the Communist Party's rebellious acts, they should be held responsible for the crime of rioting and internal strife under the first paragraph of Article 102 of the Criminal Law, and there is no doubt about it. Considering that they share the implementation of the crime as co-principals with the intention of committing a joint crime, they should be considered co-principals. They are distinct from accomplices who only engage in acts outside the elements constituting the crime with the intention of assisting others. The original indictment considered the defendants to be accomplices under the first paragraph of Article 100 of the Criminal Law, which is hardly appropriate and should be changed. The defendants are all young people who, feeling distressed, mistakenly went astray. After being arrested, they all showed remorse. Considering their attitude after the crime, a lenient sentence within the legal limit is imposed. Based on the above arguments and conclusions, according to the first paragraph of Article 291 and Article 292 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 28, the first paragraph of Article 101, the first paragraph of Article 100, Article 57, the second paragraph of Article 37, Article 38, the first paragraph, and the first and second clauses of the Criminal Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text. The case was executed in court by Prosecutor Li Peng of this court, with Zhang Qipeng, Zuo Ti, and Li Fen presiding over the criminal first division of the Zhejiang High Court. (End of full text)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Stipulates Three Principles as Standards for Distributing Fishing Vessels; Allocation to be Made in Stages Based on Actual Needs of Fisheries Departments in Various Schools</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 24th Dispatch] Cao Chu, Director of the Secondary Education Department of the Ministry of Education, was recently ordered to go to Shanghai to participate in the fishing vessel allocation meeting, and a preliminary decision has been reached. The report to the Ministry of Education briefly stated that the Ministry of Education proposed a total of thirteen units for senior high schools and vocational schools, and it was agreed to issue them as requested. However, the first phase of fishing vessel allocation is thirteen vessels, of which the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will receive two vessels, and how the remaining eleven vessels should be allocated to various schools will depend on determining the actual circumstances of the vessels' performance ranking and whether they need to be used in fleets. As for the methods of storage and use of each vessel, the required expenses, and how to send dedicated personnel to Shanghai to be responsible for supervision and liaison during allocation, all should be discussed and planned in advance, etc. The Ministry of Education has now stipulated three principles: The allocation of fishing vessels should be determined based on the existing facilities and the original level of manpower and resources of the fisheries departments in various schools. The relevant departments have been instructed to investigate and properly propose handling measures. Whether the allocation to universities should be delayed is still under study. Efforts will be made to determine the performance, tonnage, etc. of each fishing vessel as a reference for allocation. All fishing vessels are not intended to be allocated to various schools at the same time, but rather to be allocated in stages based on the actual needs of the fisheries departments in various schools.</p>

<h3>A Problem in Children's Education: How to Stop a Child from Crying (Continued and Concluded)</h3>
<p>— Chen Heqin</p>
<p>The sixth is "illness." A child will cry when he is sick. Parents must check the child's temperature at any time and study the cause of the illness and the part of the body that is affected. It is best to consult a doctor immediately. Do not prescribe medicine randomly without knowing the cause of the illness. The seventh is "discomfort." Children also cry when they are uncomfortable. For example, if a diaper is wet, it must be changed immediately, otherwise the child will feel uncomfortable and cry.</p>
<p>If we want to prevent children from crying, we must study the cause of their crying, whether they are hungry, in pain, thirsty, cold, hot, sick, or have something else that is making them uncomfortable. Once we understand the cause of their crying, we can find a way to relieve it. Adults can rest assured, and children can be healthy and well.</p>
<p>I have already talked about the physiological causes of crying. Now I will analyze the psychological causes of crying in children. The most important are three points:</p>
<p>The first point is "fear." Children often have this situation. For example, they are afraid of hearing strange sounds, or children do not want to go to sleep at night, and adults deliberately threaten them by saying that a cat or a dog is coming, causing the child to develop a fear psychology, or they hear stories about gods and ghosts. But later, as long as the child hears this kind of sound, sees some cats and dogs, or mentions these stories and nouns, he will cry.</p>
<p>The second point is "suggestion." There are many things that children do not feel, but they often cry due to the suggestion of adults. For example, a child falls and does not cry or feel any pain. Some adults prefer to say "Don't cry, little baby," "It doesn't hurt, little baby," and other such nonsense. As a result, the child who was not crying will start to cry, and the child who was not in pain will start to cry out in pain.</p>
<p>The third point is crying as a "habit." Children's bad habits are all cultivated by adults. For example, when a child wakes up and sees that no one is around, he will cry, and adults often do this, not going to pick him up until the child cries. If this happens the first time and the second time, the child will develop the habit of crying when he wakes up. To avoid this bad habit, it is best not to leave him. When he wakes up, pick him up and say a few words such as "Baby, are you awake? Good boy! Let's get up..." Then, when he wakes up, he will wait for an adult to pick him up and will not cry. For example, when eating, children always like to do it themselves and do not want adults to give it to them. If you do not agree, he will cry. If you are afraid of him crying, you let him take it himself. Then later, anything he cannot get will be threatened by crying. Therefore, when adults encounter such situations, they must harden their hearts. If he wants to cry, let him cry. Only when he stops crying and understands that he cannot take it himself will you give it to him. Then there will be no such habit.</p>
<p>Why do children often cry? Just ask why adults do not take care of them. At the very least, it is because adults are not taking care of them well. Children do not like to cry. It is because of natural physiological and psychological demands. Therefore, I say that children cry because adults are not managing them properly.</p>
<p>Here, I hope that parents with children will always study how to reduce children's crying and always study how to avoid children's crying. Otherwise, if you hear children crying all day long, adults will suffer, and children will cry too much, which will also affect their health.</p>

<h3>Cotton Spinning Adjustment Committee to Hold Joint Cotton Yarn Distribution; Chairman Yuan Xin Assumed Office Yesterday; Future Price Negotiations Will Consider Manufacturers' Production Costs</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yuan Liang, the newly appointed chairman of the Textile Business Adjustment Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, officially assumed office yesterday morning at approximately 10:00 AM, accompanied by Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Minister Chen convened all senior staff members of the committee to introduce them to Mr. Yuan individually. Mr. Yuan then, at the request of the press, made a statement highlighting four key points: The trial measures for the joint distribution of cotton yarn have been jointly approved by Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan, Vice Premier Wang, Minister Zuo of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and Director-General Zhang of the National Bank. The Textile Business Adjustment Committee, as the implementing agency, will act accordingly. Regarding implementation techniques, further consultations will be held with relevant parties. The purpose of establishing joint distribution is purely to meet the needs of these extraordinary times, and we sincerely hope for the cooperation of all manufacturers. China's industry is still in its infancy, with only the cotton spinning industry having a certain foundation. The government has no intention of destroying the cotton spinning industry. Besides addressing the people's clothing needs, the difficulties of yarn mills must also be considered. The current focus of the Textile Business Adjustment Committee is to find ways to alleviate raw material shortages. Due to transportation issues, domestic cotton cannot be supplied in a timely manner, so efforts will continue to be made to order imported cotton to supplement the supply. Simultaneously, active measures should be taken to eliminate impurities in domestic cotton. It is hoped that an ample supply of raw cotton will reduce the production costs of yarn mills. Cotton yarn and cloth exports should be limited before domestic self-sufficiency is achieved. It seems appropriate to focus on exporting items such as pigs and minerals to earn foreign exchange. In the future, cotton yarn price negotiations will be based on production costs plus reasonable profits, with the principle of maintaining yarn mills' re-production costs.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After the Textile Business Adjustment Committee announced the trial measures for cotton yarn distribution yesterday, reporters visited several leaders in the cotton spinning and replication industries, and summarized their opinions into two points: According to regulations, cotton yarn replication factories and households in Shanghai and other locations must report to the Textile Business Adjustment Committee to register. However, strict restrictions should be placed on the establishment date, credit standing, and other information of the factories and households applying for registration. The joint distribution measures are being piloted in the Shanghai area. Since the distribution targets now include replication industries in Shanghai and other locations, it will be difficult for Shanghai's yarn production to meet the needs of the national replication industry. Furthermore, the existing quotas for the replication industry in the Shanghai area will be sharply reduced. All of these issues require careful discussion and handling when formulating detailed implementation rules.</p>
<h3>Textile Business Adjustment Committee Price Negotiations Remain Unchanged; Cotton Yarn Market Flat and Weak; Fabric Market Shows Some Activity, Transactions Scarce</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Textile Business Adjustment Committee's cotton yarn price negotiations remained unchanged yesterday, with 20-count yarn maintaining its original price of 25.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>The China Textile Construction Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, totaling 1,838 bales, equivalent to 2,958.5 bales of 20-count yarn, with 706 purchase orders.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was initially flat, then weak. Ultimately, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell sharply by 2 million yuan compared to the weekend, to 46 million yuan. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns, such as 20-count, 16-count Bright, and 32-count and 40-count yarns, also fell, ranging from 500,000 to 1.45 million yuan.</p>
<p>The cotton fabric market opened with a seemingly flat but actually weak trend. As actual sales remained slow and floating inventory increased due to tight credit, many longs took profits, creating strong selling pressure in the market. Sentiment turned bearish, and prices fell. As a result, various grades of fine cloth fell by 12,000 yuan compared to the weekend, but the Dragon Head and Yang Crane grades rose by 5,000 yuan. The Four Gentlemen grade experienced a steep drop of 30,000 yuan. Due to the high cost of dyes, the sales of Shilin cloth remained good, and the price rose by 120,000 yuan, while the base prices of other cloths remained firm.</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Prices Trend Downward</p>
<p>Yesterday, the raw cotton market was weak in the morning due to few deliveries, and prices declined. In the afternoon, the market sentiment slightly improved as the cotton yarn market saw higher bids, and some dealers bought on dips, stabilizing prices somewhat. However, due to the excessive gains, and the apparent overpricing of cotton yarn under the Textile Business Adjustment Committee's distribution program, making it difficult to meet costs, yarn mills were reluctant to purchase. As a result, prices fell by around 200,000 yuan, with 1,200 bales traded. Factory delivery prices for Kai Lingbao were 5.357 million yuan, warehouse delivery prices for Kai Lingbao were 5.25 million yuan, Shashi 5.147 million yuan, Chongsha 4.712 million yuan, Tongzhou 4.051 million yuan, Qidong American Upland 4.71 million yuan, Haiti Tip 3.6 million yuan, and Zhoupu Seed Cotton 845,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Arriving Without Import Permits; Transportation Control Committee Formulates Handling Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Peruvian Office of the Transportation Control Committee issued the following measures on the 24th for handling cotton arriving without import permits or already shipped before the announcement: All cotton already registered under Announcements Nos. 2, 4, and 9 of this Committee, and either already arrived or shipped from overseas before September 30, will be handled according to these measures. All registered cotton, regardless of whether or not it requires foreign exchange, will be purchased by the Textile Export Committee on behalf of the government under the conditions stipulated in these measures. Whether or not foreign exchange needs to be paid for the purchased cotton will be based on whether the importing manufacturer indicated in their original registration application to this Committee that payment had been made. All finished products made from the purchased cotton will be exported by the government. The government will purchase the cotton, fairly allocate it based on applications from various yarn mills, entrust the yarn mills to spin the cotton on its behalf, or exchange the cotton for yarn and cloth at a set price, which will be returned to the government on schedule. The grading standards and exchange ratios will be determined separately. The yarn mills that originally imported or ordered the cotton will have priority in spinning or exchanging the cotton. However, the quota for the government's entrusted spinning to each factory should be limited to 10% of each factory's export production volume. The labor and material costs or the amount to be valued for the government's entrusted spinning or exchange of cotton yarn and cloth will be determined separately by the Textile Export Committee. The government will pay for the cotton purchased without foreign exchange in ten monthly installments. The price will be based on the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) price listed in the importer's original application to this Committee and verifiable with the original invoice. The government may also order the provision of other supporting documents. The unloading fees, storage fees, and other expenses already paid by the importing manufacturer will be reimbursed by the government in national currency based on the actual payment receipts submitted. The payment method for the government's purchase of cotton for which foreign exchange has already been paid will be handled in accordance with Announcements Nos. 3 and 7 of this Committee.</p>
<h3>Rice Sales Stagnant, Edible Oil Prices Decline</h3>

According to Cao Maoliang, the head of the economic division, starting today, they will focus on cracking down on the black market for gold and currency.

<p>Our Newspaper Nanjing, 24th dispatch: Regarding the report on the Shanghai Stock Exchange's reduction of deposit margin for deferred stock transactions, it is learned that the Executive Yuan believes that reducing the deposit margin cannot achieve the purpose of absorbing idle funds.

<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, rumors circulated in the market about the National Bank issuing banknotes with larger denominations, claiming that samples had already been discovered, describing them in detail and causing widespread speculation. Reporters specifically inquired with the National Bank official, who stated that there was no such thing. The official also stated that the National Bank had issued two types of new banknotes at the end of last week: new 10,000 yuan banknotes printed by Zhonghua Book Company's flat printing and 500 yuan Customs Gold Unit notes printed by American Bank Note Company. Samples of both types of new banknotes have been sent to various commercial banks.

The exact percentage to be added will be determined by a separate Distribution Price Subcommittee, which will invite relevant trade associations to participate in discussions. If the originally designated user of the goods applying for purchase is not a factory user, they should be allowed to purchase with priority if they can present documents such as contracts and verify that they are a direct user. However, if the originally designated user is a retailer but can present documents verifying that they are transferring the goods to a direct user, they should also be allowed to purchase with priority if it is verified to be true. The Central Trust Bureau's Purchasing Materials Division will handle the business of this Committee concurrently. The organizational regulations of this Committee were passed.</p>

<h3>A Discussion on Novel Techniques</h3>
<p>— Wei Yi</p>
<p>The Author Who Doesn't "Show Their Face"</p>
<p>The techniques of novel writing are constantly evolving. The most significant change is that in earlier novels, the author would "show their face," while in modern novels, the author has disappeared. In the novels of Fielding, Scott, Thackeray, and George Eliot, the author can be seen everywhere, instructing the reader and explaining the causes of the characters' successes and failures in detail to elaborate on their philosophy of behavior. As for modern novels, although there are occasional opportunities to make a point, the author themselves does not appear in the story and never inserts a sentence. Instead, the characters express their own thoughts and actions, and the story itself explains everything. This is a characteristic of modern novels. Only in this way can the novel be distinguished from history, philosophy, and science, and form its own camp; otherwise, it is merely their appendage.</p>
<p>Fielding was more cautious and often wrote his thoughts in the introduction. Scott, Thackeray, Trollope, and Meredith freely expressed their opinions in their books, reducing the dramatic tension. What readers want to know is real-life experience, and the author's instructions are superfluous. However, many great writers of the 19th century made this mistake. The more critical the moment, the more meaningless it feels when they explain it in a few words. Technically speaking, it can also be said that they were simply trying to save effort and unwilling to write in detail.</p>
<p>Victorian novels had three obvious trends: The author used a didactic tone to moralize. The author liked to discuss the characters in the book with the reader, with bias, hoping that the reader would adopt the same attitude. Influenced by scientific fervor, they wanted to explain the actions of the characters in the book, so that we would know that a certain phenomenon was in accordance with the universal laws of human nature. These three advantages can be said to be interrelated. However, by the 20th century, techniques shifted direction, and they were no longer so popular.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the methods of telling stories in these two eras are very different. In Victorian novels, the author was lecturing about the characters in the book, rather than letting the characters express themselves. This method was as rigid as a formula in algebra, leaving no room for imagination. Modern novelists, on the other hand, are reluctant to say much themselves, only letting the characters express their thoughts. Techniques differ, and methods have changed.</p>
<h3>On Yuan Dynasty Opera and Kunqu Opera</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Unfortunately, how Yuan Dynasty opera was actually sung has now been lost. In the late Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, He Liangjun hired Dun Ren, the only old musician at the time who was proficient in northern tunes, to teach the female performers in his family to sing Yuan Dynasty dramas (see He Liang's "Congshuo by Four Friends of the Latter Period," Volume 37). This was probably the last echo of Yuan Dynasty opera? We can only vaguely understand how Yuan Dynasty opera was sung from the more than ten Yuan Dynasty tunes that have been preserved in Kunqu opera. However, it is already "Kunqu Opera Singing Yuan Dynasty Tunes," not the original way of singing Yuan Dynasty opera.</p>
<p>What I want to try to explore now is how this small part of Yuan Dynasty opera has been preserved to the present, and what method it used to preserve it. My personal view is that the beautiful melodies of these ten or so Yuan Dynasty tunes themselves are one reason, but a more important reason is that Yuan Dynasty opera was absorbed by Ming and Qing Dynasty dramas and even palace operas. Yuan Dynasty opera has maintained its life's continuation in the position of a hermit crab.</p>
<p>In earlier selections of songs, such as "Zhu Tou Bailian" and the imperial collection "Stringed Instrument Yuan Yin," "Jiaoxiao Ji Fang Xian" is recorded. This tune is from the third act of Luo Guanzhong's "Fengyun Hui" in the Yuan Dynasty, commonly known as "Visiting Pu." It begins with the words "Crystal Palace Jiaoxiao Tent," hence the name. This "Jiaoxiao Ji" is not Shen Jing's "Jiaoxiao Ji," but simply a clever name. Also recorded is "Four Prefectures Record Single Knife," which is actually Guan Hanqing's "Lord Guan's Single Knife Meeting" from the Yuan Dynasty.</p>
<p>In the "Laifeng Guan Selected Legendary Tales," "Fengyun Hui" is mistakenly titled Qiao Mengfu's "Golden Vine Record," and "Dao Hui" is also titled "Four Prefectures Record." Wu Changling's "Journey to the West" is titled Xia Junzheng's "Northern Tang Monk." The two tunes selected, "Journey to the West" ("Xinshuilin," just left the Buddha's building) should be related to "Old Muslim chanting Buddha in the East Building," and "Farewell" ("Dianjiangchun," for the first time) should be related to "Tang Sanzang taking the scriptures from the West."</p>
<p>From the above two selections of songs, it can be known that Guan Hanqing's "Dao Hui," Wu Changling's "Journey to the West," and Luo Guanzhong's "Visiting Pu" were still very popular in the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties.</p>
<p>By the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, many dramas were absorbed into the palace operas, and then divided into scenes and spread, so the changes became more numerous. Like tangled silk, the threads became more complicated. I strongly suspect that "Ascending Peace Treasure Raft" and "Compassionate Vow" accommodated Wu Changling's "Muslim" and "Northern Farewell," and also accommodated Yang Jingxian's "Piezzi," "Recognizing Son," "Fat Gu," and "Borrowing Fan."</p>
<p>Similarly, I hypothesize that "Zhaodai Xiaoshao" accommodated "Ji Liang" and "Wutai," "Dinging Springs and Autumns" accommodated "Dao Hui," and "Qingzhong Ji" accommodated "Sweeping Qin." We have already seen this in "Kunqu Opera Extract." There is a combined edition of "Golden Sable Record Legendary Tale."</p>
<p>The performers don't care who wrote the play. As long as it is from the same dynasty and narrates the same person, they can forcibly put them together; but this makes it difficult for us who study the history of drama.</p>
<p>We should be happy that Yuan Dynasty opera can still be performed today. It is said that the Amai Chu Xian Lu No. 9 Police Station will be hosting a Kunqu Opera performance by the Xian Dian Society to raise funds for the Kunqu Opera Ancestral Temple for four days (26th to 29th, opening at 7:30 PM every night). The first two days will feature Guan Hanqing's "Single Knife Meeting," Zhu Kai's "Haotian Pagoda," "Wutai," and Kong Wenqing's "East Window Incident," "Whipping Qin." In addition to Yuan Dynasty opera, they will also perform Wang Tingna's "Lion's Roar Record," "Combing and Kneeling," Xu Lin's "Tanji Record," "Beating Son," Xu Zichang's "Water Margin Record," "Live Capture," Ruan Dachu's "Swallow Letter," "Dog Hole," Fan Xizhe's "Wild Goose Feather Armor," "Stealing Armor," Qiu Guohu's "Firing Bullet," "Mountain Pavilion," Cao Yin's complete "Life After the Tiger's Mouth," Hong Sheng's "Hall of Longevity," "Xu Pavilion, Alarming Change Buried Jade," Li Yu's "Eternal Reunion Drumming," "Hall Marriage," as well as Yi Sheng's "Borrowing Boots," Siping Tune "Thinking of Mortal World Going Down the Mountain," and martial arts opera "Ganyuan Mountain," which is simply a living history of drama.</p>
<h3>Small Town</h3>
<p>— Qin Ling</p>
<p>Two years ago, in the autumn, I arrived at X Family Market in Changshu for my job. This secluded small town initially caused me much embarrassment and unease, but in the end, my departure surprisingly brought tears to many eyes.</p>
<p>After disembarking from the steamer at the pier of X Family Market from Changshu, one had to climb up some sandy slopes. Upon reaching the main road, many rickshaws were waiting to pick up passengers. Because I disliked the rickshaws' bumpiness, I settled my luggage and asked Lao Rong, the teahouse attendant sent to pick me up, to lead the way. I followed behind him on foot. On both sides of the winding sandy road, cotton fields, peanuts, sorghum, and millet stretched out in patches. Grasshoppers chirped long and weakly. The autumn twilight sun shone feebly on the earth. Our footsteps made a "scrape, scrape" sound on the sand. I experienced the real countryside for the first time and witnessed the great power of the land. By the time we reached the town street, the shadows of dusk were quite heavy. Several donkeys were tethered in front of the mill, busily moving their jaws to chew fodder. In front of the tofu shop, freshly made tofu skins were hung in rows. The iron shop had a roaring furnace, and the spinning machine whirred loudly… a unique atmosphere enveloped this small street. In groups of two or three, village girls leaned against doorways chatting. When our group passed by, they cast surprised glances:</p>
<p>"Where are they from?"</p>
<p>"Such style!"</p>
<p>"Looks like a ghost!"</p>
<p>These words, mixed with laughter, came like sharp thorns. I lowered my head to examine my attire: a white gauze jacket, a black cheongsam, white leather shoes. It didn't seem like I had any dazzling urban colors. So, was it my glasses or my hairstyle that offended them? Thinking about the long period I would be living among these people, I felt a bit dejected. It was in this mood that I arrived at my workplace. After meeting the factory director, I was settled in my designated room. It had a slightly earthy, damp smell. In front of the window was a pond with several willow trees planted around it. Thus began my rural life.</p>
<p>The first local person I interacted with was Mrs. Zhang, the landlord of our factory house. At the age of twenty-five, she already had three children. She had studied for a few years, could handle accounting, and also managed the farm chores. Therefore, her husband could leisurely sit in the teahouse all day, go to the wine shop, and perhaps even go to the city to watch a play every three or five days. Consequently, she earned a reputation for being capable and virtuous. Opening the waist door at the back of her house's main hall led to the small courtyard in front of our office. She loved to poke half her head out and call:</p>
<p>"Mr. Qin, (a shortened form of 'teacher' here). Come over here and sit for a while!"</p>
<p>As soon as I went over to her place, she would heap corn, taro, pumpkin seeds, and dried beans in front of me, insisting that I eat them all. I wasn't particularly fond of the local produce, but her sincerity made it impossible not to force myself to try them. Flipping through her sewing box and the well-preserved children's books and newspapers published in 1937, I secretly admired this rural housewife. Her family also had a phonograph for entertaining distinguished guests. The records already had a bit of a scratchy sound. When she saw us, her children would pull on her mother: "Listen to the foreign opera!" Then, a record of foreigners laughing loudly would start spinning. The children and mother would laugh along. The laughter attracted neighbors, who would laugh along heartily without even knowing why. Their laughter made me unable to restrain myself, so I joined in with a burst of laughter. She always took my hand and said:</p>
<p>"I really like you. I don't have a younger sister, would you like to be my sworn sister?" I nodded to indicate my acceptance of her suggestion, but until I left the small town, she still called me "Mr. Qin," and I always called her "Mrs. Zhang." She didn't believe I wasn't married:</p>
<p>"A girl in her twenties, not married yet? You must be working here because you're bored and lonely in the interior."</p>
<p>She drew her own clever conclusion. I didn't argue with her. If she didn't believe me, so be it. Originally, early marriage was the custom here. Girls of fifteen or sixteen were already becoming mothers. If life is a drama, then they are all talented actors.</p>
<p>Life in the small town was as calm and peaceful as a pool of autumn water. This was perhaps due to the townspeople's tranquil nature. Taking the town street as an example, the entire town had only two streets, front and back. Five or six out of ten shops on the two streets were teahouses, restaurants, and wine shops. People who went to the early market would bring a pot of clear tea and a quick breakfast, conveniently discussing business. It had practically become a custom. Therefore, the teahouses also sold sesame cakes, fried dough sticks, steamed buns, glutinous rice cakes, and so on, never worrying about being deserted all day. The restaurant display windows were filled with piles of fresh fish, meat, chicken, and duck. You might worry that they wouldn't sell out in a day, but every day, so many customers went in and out, maintaining the restaurants' prosperity. Moreover, the town's wine shops were quite interesting places. Once autumn arrived, crabs, braised mutton, peanuts, and green beans accompanied the mung bean liquor on the market. The waiters shouted and bustled about, while the customers wore rosy smiles. Were they idle? Sit down and take a slow sip. Those who weren't idle could lean against the counters along the street for a quick drink. Even if they were wearing bamboo apron and blue gowns, they were still qualified to eat and drink. Facing the old, yellowed plaques of Pine and Crane Restaurant, Six Dynasties Residence, Taibai's Wind, Ruan Ji's Yanze…, your thoughts are pulled back thousands of years.</p>
<p>However, the small town's prosperity was built solely on "eating." And behind this prosperity were also terrible shadows. Interspersed between the restaurants and teahouses were also nests of prostitutes and brothels. The abnormal trade of souls and bodies spread with a rather alarming force. Peel off the small town's outer shell, and inside is a rotten, base, disgusting corpse. Compared to its naturally fertile land, it is truly a lamentable contrast.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the small town itself also gave me much warmth and amusement. Although my room was so simple, on moonlit nights, when the sparse willows and pale moon caressed my small window, the pond was like my mother. To it, I poured out so many repressions and unhappinesses. The bamboo fence covered with bright red wolfberries, the small wooden bridge lightly arched over the stream, and the sandy soil of that expanse of green field and blue sky all received my诉说。 In the year or so of rural life, I was able to endure it peacefully, and I cannot but thank their comfort. All the memorable people and scenes, may they be safe and enduring.</p>
<h3>Orchid</h3>
<p>— Lu Shixiong</p>
<h3>Records to Bring a Smile</h3>
<p>— Kai Gong</p>
<p>Except for Ren Houbai, named Junsu, who loved learning and had quick wit, he was humorous and good at debate. He often made defamatory jokes, which many people loved to associate with. He wrote "Records to Bring a Smile" in two volumes, all humorous stories. Sadly, the original book has been lost. The "Taiping Guangji" occasionally includes excerpts. Here is one excerpt to give a glimpse. "A Shandong man married a woman from Puzhou, who was often thin. The woman's mother had a very large neck tumor. After several months of marriage, the woman's family suspected the son-in-law was not skilled. The woman's father hosted a grand banquet for relatives to test him. He asked: 'The young man studied in Shandong, he should understand principles. The swan and crane can cry, what does this mean?' He replied: 'The angel made it so.' He asked again: 'Pine and cypress are green in winter, what does this mean?' He replied: 'The angel made it so.' He asked again: 'The tree by the road has bone bumps, what does this mean?' He replied: 'The angel made it so.' The woman's father said, 'The young man does not understand any principles, why did he stay in Shandong!' So he teased him: 'The swan and crane can cry because their necks are long, the pine and cypress are green in winter because their hearts are strong, the tree by the road has bone bumps because the car broke it: how can the angel made it so?' The son-in-law said: 'The toad can cry, but does it have a long neck? Bamboo is also green in winter, but does it have a strong heart? Your wife's neck has such a large tumor, how can the car have broke it?'"</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Old Brother, you don't even know how much I suffered this time." He Jian defended himself, "That damn bastard put me through hell! ... Do you know how many days this whole trip was? ..."</p>
<p>"Seven days, maybe." I answered casually.</p>
<p>"No!" He Jian glanced at his watch, "It's 0:25 now, it's already crossed into another day, I say it's nine days..."</p>
<p>"How nine days?" I wasn't very focused. Seven days or nine days, these two numbers didn't mean much to me.</p>
<p>"Counting from July 31st; today is August 8th, 0:00, including both ends, how can it not be nine days?" He Jian tried to clarify.</p>
<p>"Okay, nine days then... so what?" I wondered why he was so concerned about such a trivial matter, so insignificant.</p>
<p>"No," He Jian took a few puffs of his "Fushima" brand cigarette, and grinded it into a pile of ashes in the ashtray as if grinding ink, then lit a new one again: "You might think it's insignificant, but you don't know the suffering in it - both physical and mental - look at me!"</p>
<p>Hearing his words, I really looked closely at his face. He Jian had indeed changed shape. His usually rosy and full cheeks were now blueish-purple, and had shrunk a lot, looking like after an illness, or after sleepless nights. His eyes, which were always bright and shining, had become sluggish, and his eye sockets had sunken; along with his dashing eyebrows, they now seemed to droop, and at first glance, they vaguely looked like the character eight. Yes, he had indeed changed shape a bit, and had lost some weight.</p>
<p>"Didn't that old man, that old what? ... old 'Turtle'?" (referring to Konoe) Yes, didn't that old guy issue an order, telling me to return to Tokyo for training?" He Jian looked at me, his eyes wide.</p>
<p>"Yes." I moved my gaze from his face to his hands; because at this time he was grinding a second cigarette again.</p>
<p>"Training for what?" This was probably another Guanwai speaking habit, almost every sentence had a question mark like he was eating raw rice. He Jian asked, and immediately answered himself: "Training, it's probably a euphemism for a military court! Old Brother, you think I can stay calm after receiving this order?"</p>
<p>I didn't say anything, just cracked a smile, showing my teeth, to express sympathy and give him some sympathy.</p>
<p>"Damn bastard, it's like two drummers, banging wildly in my chest, you can imagine how bad it tasted." He Jian raised his voice and said in one breath.</p>
<p>"It definitely tasted bad!" I replied. No wonder he insisted on turning seven days into nine days; he must have suffered a lot during these "nine days."</p>
<p>The above is the opening dialogue of our conversation. Immediately afterwards, after taking a few deep breaths and puffs of cigarettes, He Jian told me the whole story, in great detail.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Close the Door Behind You</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>When the northwest wind rises, everyone feels a chill, and the small red strips of paper with "Close the Door Behind You" appear as needed; especially in the busy entrances and exits of the office, if the building is already old, and the mud on the walls is peeling off, presenting an indescribable mysterious color, then on that door, or next to the door, is pasted a narrow white strip of paper, with four characters crookedly arranged on it, and if you look closely, isn't it "Close the Door Behind You"!</p>
<p>The day the Siberian cold air mass, or simply the cold wave from Japan, invades this city, is the time when these small strips of paper appear. Great is the change of weather; insignificant is the power of words!</p>
<p>Assuming that our country's science is advanced, and production is not backward, all the office doors must be equipped with freely opening and closing springs, no matter whether you run in or out, just move your body, slip past the door, and with a bang behind you, no, not a loud sound, the door will automatically close. However, it is not easy to talk about, this kind of new equipment, may not be universally realized in a short time of ten or eight years.</p>
<p>If material resources are insufficient, human resources are sufficient. Big hotels, restaurants, and dance halls use waiters to open doors. Guests don't have to bother lifting their hands and feet, entering and exiting freely, without any concerns, which is worth promoting. However, these places are mainly for spending money, and the wool comes from the sheep, so the enjoyment of the customers is still their own contribution. A few places can do this, but extending it widely will definitely not work.</p>
<p>It is better to ask for oneself than to ask for others. We might as well first explore why some people are unwilling or unwilling, not used to, or even unable to close the door? Here, we feel that if we want everyone to close the door, we must first start with cultivating good habits. Westerners say: "An old dog can't learn new tricks". Good habits must be cultivated from childhood: middle-aged people are busy with food and clothing, or confused by fame and fortune, who has so much free time to practice closing or opening doors. Not to mention old people, if you mess it up, he says, what if I don't close it? What can you do about it. Only by teaching our next generation, and practicing "small hands close doors" from childhood, can we still save the situation!</p>
<p>Because of the "Close the Door Behind You" strips of paper, I thought of other such folk strips of paper, which further proves the lack of spirit of words and the omnipotence of science. For example, "Jiang Taigong is here...", "Taishan Stone Dare", "Emperor...Emperor...", "Selling Severe Cold...", and even "XX Please Step Forward", "Spit Phlegm into the Urinal" etc., all show that the level of folk education is too poor, too casual, and too lacking in self-esteem, and good habits are not cultivated from childhood. We should never laugh at these strips of paper, we only feel that everything should be introspected, don't gloss over the surface, and aim too high.</p>
<p>One door after another, there are really many kinds of doors. Lao Tzu said: Mysterious and mysterious, "the gate of all mysteries" and the mysterious female gate, is called the root of heaven and earth. The words are so great. Now that the door of democracy has been opened, the election campaign is in full swing, and the National Assembly and Legislators are well-matched. The ancients created characters, using one leaf as one household, and two leaves as a door. Countless disputes in the world arise from prejudice, dividing bushels and breaking scales so that the people do not compete, and when there is no boundary in the chest, prejudice will be eliminated, and the open door policy of Monrow will be realized.</p>
<p>Westerners also have signs on the door saying "Please Knock". This is the opposite of "Close the Door Behind You". The Chinese people do not seem to pay much attention to the privacy and freedom of individuals. They often rush straight in, invading other people's studies and bedrooms, as a sign of intimacy and friendship. Western men and women, although they can strip naked on the beach without any scruples, are very particular about this. No matter whether they are family or friends, when they encounter someone closing the door, they must first knock lightly on the door, and only when they hear a "please" from inside can they enter. The office is of course no exception.</p>
<p>Ge Hong said: "... or there are those who do not inform the host, but rush forward together, and before the strict decorations can be identified, they no longer peek and listen, breaking doors and closing locks, jumping over walls and drilling through cracks, like the arrival of a raid. And if the concubines and concubines hide too late, they even search for hidden places, and pull them out on the spot, which is also a strange thing. For the gentleman's residence, he does not even cover up the imperfections of his family, so when entering the door, he raises his voice, and when ascending the hall, he looks down, and what reason is there to be abrupt to other people's families? ..." Zhi Chuan was a person of the Jin Dynasty, more than a thousand years ago, and at that time people already had the good habit of raising their voices when entering the door, but at the same time they could not avoid breaking doors and closing locks, and were unwilling to allow others freedom to retreat. So which came first, bad behavior or etiquette? This and the question of which came first, the chicken or the egg, seem to be equally difficult to answer.</p>
<p>Although the door is set up, closing it often can reduce many troubles. Entering the public door, bowing as if in fear, and not standing in the middle of the door, and not stepping on the threshold, are also all manifestations of attentive politeness. Confucius said: You is playing the zither, why is it for my door... Confucius said: You has ascended the hall, but has not entered the room. Zilu really asked for it himself, playing the zither did not conform to the elegant odes, and was thus ridiculed by the master. If they went elsewhere to play music, and did not approach the old gentleman's door, perhaps this unpleasant thing would not have happened. The sage attached importance to his door, and would never be careless. How many people are qualified to be listed in his door? Otherwise, they would look longingly at the high walls, unable to enter. Even if they became old party members with white hair, they would still be seen as outsiders.</p>
<p>Today's people only seek practical benefits, and do not necessarily investigate the style of the door. Once a tile is turned over, someone will respectfully press the head of the rich and powerful family onto it. From then on, the golden door and jade hall will be smooth sailing. The door is high, and the courtyard is like a market. But if you mess it up, and it suddenly collapses, it will immediately become empty.</p>
<p>Today, everything is expensive, and people's livelihoods are declining. Pessimists only have two invisible doors, the first is that there is no door to appeal to, and the second is that there is no door to enter the ground. There are great difficulties, and small difficulties. Although they are willing to "close the door behind them", what can they do if there is no door? The speaker said that those who come to speculate in gold banknotes and stocks are all opening living doors, hitting every door, and their joy can be imagined. The American loan is rolling down the mountain, and is still far away; only the sound of the stairs is heard, but no one is seen coming down. The government and the public are waiting on tiptoe, with no door to open, let alone close. If President Truman officially announces it, the wind of speculation may be slightly curbed, but now they can only sigh at the ocean and lick their lips as they pass the butcher's shop.</p>
<h3>Saying Yes But Not Really</h3>
<p>— Feng Ren</p>
<p>There is a note in the Qing people's notes about Wang Mingsheng, roughly saying: "When Wang Mingsheng was not yet successful, he was poor and ran around the capital to big families. Every time he entered someone's house, he would make a gesture of holding something in his hands, and made a 'hiss, hiss' sound. People were surprised and asked him, and he said: 'I am inviting the wealth of the Mo family into my arms.' That's how greedy and despicable he was. However, the poems and articles he wrote were full of integrity and did not resemble his behavior. When people asked him about this, he would say: 'Reputation only lasts for one generation, but poems and articles will be passed down for hundreds of generations. After hundreds of generations, the reputation will gradually disappear, and my poems and articles can be passed down.'"</p>
<p>Words and actions are often inconsistent. You should be careful of people who speak eloquently, and pay attention to their behavior. Qian Qianyi's articles were passionate and inspiring, even surpassing Shi Kefa. If later generations only read Yin Rugeng's great work "Tragedy of National Subjugation", how could they have imagined that he would be the number one traitor in North China. (Miscellaneous notes under the lamp)</p>
<h3>Life on Earth</h3>
<p>— Broken Wheel</p>
<p>The total time of Earth's existence, as generally estimated by people, is only a rough number. However, the length of time is undeniable. The appearance of human beings on Earth, however, is a recent event.</p>
<p>The ancestor of human beings is called Pithecanthropus, which means ape-man or monkey-man. It proves that human beings evolved from the animal world, and there is no longer any question about this.</p>
<p>In the relatively ancient strata, no traces of human beings or their tools have ever been found. This is powerful proof that human beings appeared later on Earth.</p>
<p>But before there were human beings, there were already birds and beasts. Because this is also a fact obtained from the strata; and it proves that whether birds or beasts, they were all formed by reptiles. For example, on the banks of the Don River in Ukraine, near Voronezh, many petrified trees have been found, and the stones are filled with the remains of many ancient marine animals. At the same time, what is even more interesting is that it tells us: the place where the Don River now flows was a sea millions of years ago, and ancient marine life developed in the sea. And in that sea, the animals that lived at that time were called sea hedgehogs. At the same time, there were also arm-bone animals.</p>
<p>All these secrets are told by the silent stones.</p>
<p>Life on Earth seems to have started from fish, but it is not like that. Before fish, in the ancient ocean, there were many animals that were simpler than fish. Such as sponges, corals, jellyfish, and special shrimp, etc. However, going deeper into the strata, there are even earlier animals that are even simpler, so simple that they do not resemble any modern animals.</p>
<p>The strata prove that life on Earth originated very early, and started from very simple organisms.</p>
<h3>How to Use Your Eyes</h3>
<p>— Xiao Wen</p>
<p>Few people know that sad thoughts can hurt us. And joyful, happy thoughts create happy eyes. Because the eyes are very sensitive organs, closely related to the brain and nervous system; negative emotions such as worry, fear, and anger can seriously damage the eyes. People who are accustomed to worrying will eventually cause great damage to their eyes.</p>
<p>Relaxing the eyes is the most effective way to improve vision. Now you can try it yourself: remove your glasses, sit down facing a book or a calendar with numbers, close your eyes gently for a while, cover your eyes with your warm, gentle palms, but do not press hard, then place your elbows on your knees or on the table in front of you, so that your body and mind are relaxed, and do not think about anything for a while—turn your head slightly to both sides. Then open your eyes and blink slightly, and you will find that the things you just looked at are now brighter and clearer.</p>
<p>Some people are always tense from head to toe. This extreme nervousness also affects the eyes, which is very bad. And the way to relax the eye muscles is to blink often. The so-called blinking refers to the gentle and quiet opening and closing of the eyes, and must not be done quickly or impetuously. Healthy eyes often blink quickly and unconsciously.</p>
<p>Children's eyes are always blinking lightly and quickly, so their eyes are very bright, while the eyes of elderly or stressed people, the so-called staring, refers to the eyes being honest and fixed, staring unnaturally, thus making the eyeballs become blurred and uneasy.</p>
<p>Blinking is sufficient to keep the eyes moist and smooth, which is necessary for healthy and comfortable eyes. So when you use your eyes, remember to blink from time to time, this is a good way to avoid staring.</p>
<h3>Underground Steel Plant</h3>
<p>— Bin Zhi</p>
<p>During the war, there were many underground factories in the caves of our country's southwestern border area to prevent enemy aircraft from bombing, but the scale was very small.</p>
<p>Since the war became three-dimensional, countries have tried to move many factories underground, so as not to become targets for enemy aircraft bombing. Especially after the appearance of the atomic bomb, there is an even greater need for adequate protection. Because the stagnation of industry is more serious than the failure on the battlefield.</p>
<p>The United States has begun planning to build large-scale underground steel mills and chemical plants. Taking steel as an example, the United States has produced a total of 100 million tons in the past 20 years, which is a major resource for economic and military needs. There are plans to build a large underground steel plant in Utah, which can produce one percent of the country's steel within two years after the war. The construction of this factory requires the excavation of 50 million cubic feet of rock, and there can be a large workshop 1,500 feet long. There is complete ventilation equipment, which can supply hundreds of tons of fresh, healthy air per minute according to the needs of the workshop, and there is sufficient water source, which can draw thousands of tons of clean water from underground per minute. The implementation of this plan is estimated to cost 30 million US dollars.</p>
<p>Ideally, at least half of the steel mills in the United States should be moved underground in order to maintain the need for steel during wartime. That would require 1.5 billion yuan, and it would take five years to design. But another problem has arisen, although the factory can be hidden, the vast mine is still unavoidable. Eighty-five percent of the iron ore in the United States may be bombed and production will stop after the outbreak of war. The railway for transporting ore is also easily targeted by the enemy. The United States is now anxious about these two points.</p>
<p>Miss America</p>
<h3>Racial Prejudice of Miss America</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>The country that shouts the slogans of freedom and equality the loudest is also the country with the most profound racial discrimination. This racial discrimination has deep-rooted reasons beyond prejudice.</p>
<p>America is the country with the most complex races, forming self-contained systems, even without interaction despite being neighbors. Except for European expatriates whose living habits are not much different from Americans, the cunning and untamed nature of blacks, the licentiousness and laziness of Mexicans, and the drug trafficking and smuggling of Orientals all affect the safety and purity of America. Americans' temper is such that if they say someone is good, they are good to the heavens, and if they say someone is bad, they are bad to hell. Therefore, once you lose credibility with Americans, you will be looked down upon by them for life. They have always looked down on people of color, listing them as inferior races. In fact, since people with strong armor and sharp weapons conquered most of the world, people of color have fallen into the abyss of poverty, and everything has declined. Taking the Chinese, who are relatively able to stand up among people of color, as an example, they are not enough to be compared with them. Aren't the corrupt and ubiquitous upper-class Chinese the scum of people of color? You can't blame people for being prejudiced.</p>
<p>Their knowledge of the Chinese ultimately comes from books and newspapers. What good things are there to expect from the descriptions of the Chinese in books and newspapers? Their impression of Mexicans is even worse. Miss America never associates with Mexicans, and they also do not want Chinese people to associate with Mexicans. They often advise Chinese boys not to have entanglements with Mexican girls. They say Mexican women are the most fickle, like fierce flames when passionate, but once they change their minds, they become strangers.</p>
<p>They simply hate blacks to the bone, regarding them as poisonous snakes and fierce beasts. Wherever blacks live, Americans not only no longer reside there, but even white people no longer walk on that street. Blacks are excellent in intelligence, but their morality is indeed a problem. There are often cases of black men raping white women. According to general criticism, blacks are extremely ferocious and lustful, and their sexuality is unstoppable when it is aroused. Black men and women have no restraint on sexual desire. You rarely see healthy black girls, but whether this is due to excessive lust is difficult to say for sure, or it may be slander by Americans. However, Miss America has a considerable affection for Chinese students. According to research results, Chinese people value love and have patience. Miss America's racial prejudice is overcome by the resilience of Chinese men. (10)(5)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Children's Welfare Promotion Association: Enthusiastic Social Relief Work</h3>
<p>A letter from the Shanghai Children's Welfare Promotion Association states: "Previously, we received two transfers from your department. The gentlemen of Yonghe Cotton Knitting Factory donated 800,000 yuan in gift money for children's welfare to celebrate the birth of the factory owner Ye Jun's son. We were entrusted to use it appropriately and were deeply impressed by your department's enthusiasm for serving society and caring for children's welfare! After investigation, the donation has now been used for 'case work' assistance, including: 1. Living expenses of 250,000 yuan for a poor widow with two young children. 2. Living allowances of 300,000 yuan for two children and two adults in an unemployed worker's family. 3. Living expenses of 300,000 yuan for an abandoned woman with two young children. 4. Medical expenses of 150,000 yuan for an unemployed worker's wife who fell ill after childbirth, totaling 1,000,000 yuan. In addition to using the 800,000 yuan donation, the remainder was paid from the association's operating expenses. We are informing you of this and expressing our gratitude, hoping that you will publish it! Respectfully addressed to the Social Services Department of the Shenbao Newspaper Editorial Department."

<h3>Chen Shangze's Life or Death Unknown, Longing for His Early Return</h3>
<p>Editor: My husband, Chen Shangze, is from Guanqiao, Dongyang, Zhejiang. He is 27 years old this year and enlisted in the army in 1939, assigned to the First Battalion of the Second Regiment of the 34th Provisional Division of the Army (Battalion Commander Zhang Zuoshen). Since 1941, when he was in Shengxian County, I received one letter from him, but there has been no news since then, and his life or death is unknown. His parents rely on him, and his wife waits for him, hoping for his return. If any kind-hearted gentlemen, superiors, or colleagues know of his whereabouts, please notify us on his behalf. We will be eternally grateful. If he himself sees this notice, I hope he will return home as soon as possible, or send a message, so as not to be waiting in vain. With regards, Chen Zhu Cuiou of Dongyang (Address: c/o Mr. Zhu Changshi, Xikou Zhuan, Silukou, Yongkang, Zhejiang). Reader's Mailbox</p>
<p>To Mr. Yu Yanzheng of Shanghai: The letter you sent is unclear and impossible to speculate. I hope you will consult an ophthalmologist for examination, and do not take drugs indiscriminately.</p>
<p>To Mr. Liu Ping of Wujin: This is due to excessive secretion of sebaceous glands, causing acne due to poor excretion. It is a common phenomenon among young people and is not a disease. "Xini Jie" is a medicine for treating scabies, how can it be used randomly! Pores cannot be shrunk, and it is not necessary.</p>
<p>To Mr. Yang Huai of Shanghai: The space in our newspaper is limited, and your letter cannot be published. We are very sorry!</p>
<p>To Mr. Ma E of Shanghai: It seems that there is no law to rely on for your matter.</p>
<p>To the Peiping Suzhou Middle School Alumni Association in Peiping: We have received your letter and have forwarded it to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education for handling.</p>
