<h3>美金庫券公債兩案　立法程序已告完成　俞財長與會作詳細說明</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿七日電〕立院第四屆第三二〇次會議，廿七日上午九時廿分在該院議場舉行，出席委員柳克述。陳顧遠·樓桐孫·林彬·狄膺等一〇五人，孫院長主席，報告事項後，主席宜布變更議事日程，先行討論財政委會會同經濟委會報告，審查卅六年短期庫券條例及卅六年美金公債條例兩草案，並請列席之俞部長鴻鈞加以說明，並答覆各委員質疑多起，歷一小時許退席，該案旋經修正通過。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕政府發行四億美金債券案，業經廿七日晨立院四屆三二〇次例會完成立法程序，四月一日即開始發售。財長俞鴻鈞廿七日列席立法院會議，報告發行經過時，說明此舉主要目的在吸收游資，安定金融，以達成平衡預算，並指出此次所發倩券利息相當優厚，民間必能踴躍競購，最棧鄭重聲明，此舉為政府樹信於民最重要措施，於國於民，皆屬有利，保證將來所組織之　金監理委會必能公開與健全，茲將俞氏報告摘要誌次：經濟緊急措施方案公布後，當局為達成平衡預算目的，計對整頓稅收與處理敵僞物資晋極注意，俾能减沙發行，穩定金融，藉以平衡預算。然上述兩種工作不能收效於一時，而滬地游資又極充斥，頭寸集中，銀行紛紛謀求出路，向證券及公使橫衝直撞，若無有效辦法，難免不掀風作浪。當局有感於此，深覺欲求預算平衡，除依賴增稅等辦法外，發行公債宜可加以考慮。財部考慮此一問題時，曾注意下列各點：第一，人民心理莫不趨利，公債利率不高，不易引起人民興趣，因之，庫券利率定為兩分，可謂相當優厚，其由法令時時更動，往往失信於民，因之，發行公債時，須予民眾保障。此次發行債券，有基金監理委會之組織，除政府外，地方人士及法團皆得參加。此外，所有基金以敵僞物資與國營事業担保，且於事先撥交委會，如是人民當可感覺有所保障。利息方面，短期庫券利息二分，為歷來所未有，當時有人認以後恐難以為繼，財部考慮時，認上海市場中大一分，大一分半毫不是奇，年息二分，固不堪大。就政府立場言，則已甚高，但若能於短期內迅速吸進四萬六千億法幣，利息一點，似可不必加以考慮。談及還本付息，將來還本，照當日央行掛牌折算付給，殊合保本條件，因之，利息雖較市場為低，人民亦感有利。至美金公債利息定為六釐，，其理由為美金公債為長期性質存款，且以美金及其他外幣存款或現款及黃金繳購，其中在外存款有六釐利息，已屬甚厚，政府對在外存款處理辦法，業已擬就甲報條例，即送立院，對於此種款項，當局務使其獲得出路，並充分加以利用。此外，凍結金鈔亦非辦法，當局擬予吸收，政府為昭大信計，並於第六條規定，由國府頒令，聲明將來美金公債一定以美金償還，以示信於民。</p>
<h3>以黃金繳購公債　每兩折合美金五十元</h3>
<p>另一要點為黃金折合率，由財部以另命令規定，若以黃金繳購公債，其折合率每兩以　金五十元計算，易言之，即由每兩四十八萬增為六十萬，無異增加百分之廿，此亦為吸收辦法之一。俞氏結論稱：此舉事前曾與滬銀行界一再商討，政府亟盼利用此一機會，昭大信於天下，與良更始，使人民深感此次債券確有保障，此事有利於國，有利於民，希望發行後，至少能吸收一部份游資，以應目前需要。俞氏於答覆質問時稱：政府當時曾考慮將短期庫券還本期由三年改為兩年，然如是一改，還本過速，游資吸入未久，即行吐出，壓力太大，殊失原意，故定為三年。若干立委建議，短期庫券先試發一億美金，俞氏期期以為不可，認若僅發一億美金，對當前財政無多大助益，並希望國人堅定信心，並認目前一切舉措，凡是减少發行，收縮通貨者，皆應為之，技術上固可商討，然數目不容變更，此類治標辦法，若再配以治本方策，物價金融不難穩定，難關不難渡過，經濟因此而有轉機亦未可知，盼能鼓起勇氣。俞氏最後並以鄭重語調，聲明此次發行債券全屬自由認購，絕無攤派之意，同時以財政部長身份，保證將來基金監理委會之組織務求其公開及健全，全會咸報以熱烈掌聲。</p>
<h3>樓桐蓀接見本報記者　談發行債券意義　引導游資轉入建設坦途</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕經濟權威樓桐蓀，廿七日接見本報記者，談渠對政府發行四億美元債券之感想稱：在疏導游資，穩定幣值，從而逐漸平抑物價，以謀回復經濟常態的角度上來看，此次美金債券四億元的發行，原則上我想是沒有人會不贊成的。自緊急方案實施以後，民間金鈔尤其是黃金多已凍結不動，如果使這樣很大的一部份的財富長此擱置，不設法予以利導而運用之，是整個國家經濟的一筆大損失。一億美金公債的發行，其意義與目的，應該就在避免這種損失，而使金鈔得到一條出路。游資作祟，早為國人所疾首痛心，而同時這種游資又很像是一種視而不見，聽而不聞，來去無跡，飄忽不定的怪魔，要想倉卒間予以全面擊潰和澈底消滅，在我國的社會組織和金融財政的現制之下，實在可說是「談何容易」，然而這個怪魔，又勢非制止它的活動或改善它的活動，很難使我們一般的經濟情形回復到正常的狀態。發行公債，本是國家財政一種正當的手段（國家財政不外賦稅，舉　和發行通貨），多少年來政府早就應該實行，乃過去負責當局不此之圖，而以各種做買賣方式「尤其是拋售黃金」，在市場上枝枝節節與民爭利，以謀財政上的彌補，本是一種錯誤，現在我們決不可一誤再誤，而應迅速回到正當的財政途徑上來。一方面為游資開出路，吸引游資，使之第一步走入正常的金融儲蓄機構裏來，再配合政府的指導和管理。第二步轉入於生產建設的坦途上去，另一方面可使法幣回籠，避免通貨的繼續膨脹。穩定幣值，亦即是穩定物價，使國家財政的收支無論是差與不差，或差的多少，都可能求得一個較為眞當而確定的數字，然後方談得到全盤經濟的根本解決。「例如幣制的改革，稅制的調整等」，使國家向新經濟新建設的大道邁進，以建設三民主義的新中國。此次三億之美金短期庫券的發行，折合法幣三萬六千億元，數字雖不能算是太大，但若能推行盡利，重行樹立國信，再加以其他多方面的妥善配合，實在可說是具有重大的意義，而不難收到預期的效果的。基於以上的看法，本人對於這次公債發行，認為是適合時宜的一種辦法，當能得到金融界與全國人民的信任和擁護。經濟危機，往往比政治或軍事的危　都要深刻嚴實，我們為謀挽救戲前的危機，於沒有其他更好的評法以前，實地亦不能再不信賴政府，擁護這比較最正當，最合理的財政辦法。但是末了還有兩點必須提起政府的特別注意，第一，條例中所設的監理委會，必須要組織健全，並絕對公開，第二，至少至少我們政府在這兩個公債期限內（庫券三年公債十年），對於這兩種公債的信用，必說，在十年以內，我們政府對於這兩種公債條例所定的每句每字，都必須始終確切實行，無論在任何意外的情形或變化之下，都萬萬不可再有絲毫足以影響信用的舉措，這是非常重要的。上述兩點萬一不能完全做到，那麼國家信用眞將永遠不能恢復，而非陷於整個破產的悲慘境地不可，這個責任太大了，切望負責當局於這兩種公債通過立法院付諸實行之初，務須加以萬分鄭重的考慮。</p>
<h3>上海黑市游資　總額達二萬億　簡貫三主提高中產以下生活</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕立委簡貫三談：美金庫券之發行，與本人以前主張黃金停止買賣，外幣收歸國有及以公債收購國外存款大致尚合，但就經濟上及施行方法上觀察，尚有特別注意的條件，（一）美金公債較庫券有利，將來推銷時，應劃全國為幾大區，組織推銷委會。（二）將來還本時，如係向國外買置機器原料作工業建設之用，政府應特別予以便利，以示獎勵。（三）僅以此二項公憤。庫券，仍難挽救財政，經濟危機，應盡量縮减開支，準備整理通貨，節制財富集中，肅淸官僚資本，提高中產以下人民生活，倡導工業建設，方有整個改觀之觀之可能。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿七日電〕社會經濟學者簡貫三談：此次發行美金公債及庫券，就財政觀點言，蓋欲補助赤字預算，並减少國稱之發行數及流通速率。就經濟觀點言之，本年一月十七日以後，黃金外幣持有人，向中央銀行兌換國幣者甚少，大批黃金外幣既不兌換為國幣，又不能代替通貨作為交易收付之用，於是成為呆貨或死的資本。此次發行美金公債，規定以黃金或外幣繳購，即希望將此類死的資本變為半流通性的資本，直接使經濟界之局轉比較靈活，間接使黑市利率之威　稍為減輕。至於短期庫券之發行，旨在吸收游資，聞上海一隅有二萬億元左右之黑市游資，如比大量黑市遊資，一且興風作浪，無異流憲四面竄擾，為害必烈。此次發行三億美元庫券，即在吸收大董游資，以减少其猖獗之勢。</p>
<h3>報告臺灣事件眞相　白部長發表廣播　臺省改制方案即可頒行</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北廿七日電〕白崇禧今日下午八時假臺灣廣播電台，對全國同胞及國外僑胞發表廣播，報告台灣事件，全文如下：台灣此次發生不幸事變，余經多方觀察，探取眞相，現已獲得充分的了解，此乃由於合胞受了日本五十一年的統治，日人施行偏狹的惡性敎育，歪曲宣傳中國政府人民及軍隊的不良，使合胞輕視祖國和組國的人民及軍隊，發生深刻惡感，所以台胞先入為主，深深種下了不良的印象，這易暴動的遠因。光復以後，中國共產黨在國內惡意宣傳，詆毀中國國民政府革命軍，並且稱兵造亂，希圖顚覆政府，台灣少數共黨及野心家，亦同時在台造謠惑眾，利用緝私案件，掀起二二八事變的暴動大風潮。我們從所謂卅二條件各地暴民所發出的命令，宣言，標語來看不僅是要求改革政治，並曾使用暴力，圍攻台省公署與警備總部，及基隆高雄兩要塞，以及空軍基地，軍需倉庫等處，其企岡直欲推翻政府奪取政權，而其行動亦極偏狹殘忍，內地來台帮助台灣建設，及敎育台灣子弟的公敎人員及其眷屬，被暴徒擊斃擊傷者在千人以上，這是暴動的經過概要，確是一件可痛心的事情。余於三月十七日到達台北，曾與當地政府及民意機關交換意見，詢明經過情形，並於廿日出發，視察曾被暴徒襲擊過的基隆高雄兩要塞，並經過屏東，鳳山，台南，台中，彰化，新竹，桃園各縣市，這些地方在事變當中，都被暴徒佔據，陷於極度混亂，現在秩序均已恢復，人民復業，照常工作，台東秩序恢復更早，看了十分欣慰。現除少數共黨及暴動份子，畏罪竄匿山中外，其餘絕大多數的台胞，均能深明大義，擁護祖國，不為亂黨所煽惑。至於中央政府今後治台方針，正在擬定合於台灣民眾的要求的妥善方案，大致在政治方面擬將行政長官公署制度改為省政府制度，惟為配合實際需要起見，將增設若十　處，省政府各廳處人員並將儘先選用當地合格優秀之人士。在經濟方面擬積極整頓公營事業，扶助民營事業。在敎育方面，當加強國語國文，積極傳播祖國傳統的道德和文化，一面更澈底劃去餘毒務使台灣與祖國密切運結，增進台胞與全國同胞的情形。這些實施方案，想不久必可頒行。</p>
<p>台灣與祖國雖然一木之隔，但因淪陷達半世紀之久，內地人士及國外僑胞對於台灣事變，深恐未能十分明瞭，難免以訛傳訛，有失眞相，故將台灣事變眞相，作一公正明確的報告，使關心台灣之同胞得以安。</p>
<p>台灣是中國的國防重鎭，台灣的人民多數是閩粵各省過來的，他們與國內同胞血統相關，利書與共，深望全國同胞多多了解台灣，多多扶助台灣，更深望台胞本國家至上的精神，愛　祖國，並與全國同胞相親相愛，協同一至，建設三民主義之新台灣，建設團結統一強大的中華民國。</p>
<h3>交換中國情報問題　英代表拒絕參加</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿六日電〕美國務卿馬歇爾，最近提議由三強交換對於中國之情報一事，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫曾以類似之照會分別送達馬歇爾及英國外相貝文，表示同意在四月一日以前互相交換對於中國問題之情報，並將北項情報通知中國政府，但英國代表團本日拒絕參加交換情報，並謂，英國並無代表駐在華北，故無情報可以交換。英國參加討論中國問題之唯一理由，僅在英國參加一九四五年莫斯科三國外長會議，並在席間贊同不干涉中國內政之政策而已。</p>
<h3>國代選舉罷免法草案　立法院熱烈討論　婦女代表增至二九一人</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕立院廿七日上下午討論國大代表選舉罷免法草案時，婦女及職業代表名額間題，引起激烈爭辯，「公說公有理，婆說婆有理」（引鐘天心委員語），熱鬧緊張中，雜以笑聲，面紅耳赤後，握手言歡，整日會議毫無沉悶之感，今日開會，除谷正綱列席說明外，婦女界代表列席旁聽者有羅衡，包德明等十餘人，孫院長夫人亦列席，以壯聲勢。旁聽席上坐為之滿。職業團體代表王曉籟等，則高踞電影放映機旁，有似戲院之包廂，每當立委發言，對彼等有利時，掌聲隨之而起。</p>
<p>討論名額時，遵守「女人第一」原則，先討論婦女名額問題，趙懋華。譚惕吾·材岩等五女立委相繼發言，有要求婦女名額應佔百數十分之一者，有主張應維特百分之廿者，亦有認百分之廿者僅為起點，而非終點者，並舉出婦女對國家社會供獻殊大，決不可因將來國大會堂過小，不能容納，遽加限制。男立委鐘天心謂公說公有理，婆說婆有理，欲謂合理，應於憲法中謀求解決，將來所選區域代表，並非全屬男性，男女皆有平等機會，並以幽默語調，希望將來婦女代表能佔總額百分之八十以上，「使我們男子可以閒一些」。簡貫三指出，女子過去亦曾有耀武揚威時期，即目前男子雖在社會上稍佔優勢，然在家庭中儘不乏「雌伏」者，我人不應儘算舊賬，簡氏贊成女代表應佔總額十分之一，然盼將來選出之代表開會時應兼顧各種問題，而不應以替女子說話為限。最後表決，女代表總額增至十分之一，共二九一人，其中七十一人為職業代表。繼討論職業代表名額，會中對此種制度僉表反對，亦有主張將其自四五〇名減為二五〇名者，惟因國防會決議，未便變更，決議仍照原數。此外，僑民代表及內地生活習慣特殊，國民代表名額分配，亦有若干立委提出意見，然皆照原數通過，今日討論至第四條，廿八日</p>
<h3>處置在外存款辦法　俟國防會通過後即可公布</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕處置我在外存辦法，業送國防委會，不日或可公布，頃據擬訂辦法某氏談：該辦法中曾列有「以在外存款之原幣提存國行」一條，但無利息，今見發行美金公債條例中規定，有外幣購買公債條款，是則在外有存款經解凍申報後，即可轉向購買公債，因公債不僅有息，且息甚高，此點實足以使在外存款多一出路。又聞：該辦法可望於最近在國防會通過，其中申報限期，僅為一個月，如違則處以一年至五年之徒刑。</p>
<h3>美我庫券公債條例　券債均得自由買賣或抵押　民國三十六年　短期庫券條例</h3>
<p>第一條　國民政府為穩定金融，鼓勵儲蓄，發行庫券，定名為民國三十六年短期庫券。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>美元券之發行</h3>
<p>國防最高委會廿六日例會，通過發行三十六年短期庫券三億美元暨美金公債一億美元兩案，消息已誌昨今本報。關於票面，短期庫券分五千，一千，一百，五十等六種，利率年息二分，每六個月付息一次，還本期限三年；美金公依票面分五千，一千，一百，五十五種，利率年息六釐，每六個月付息一次，還本期限十年。關於担保，短期庫券就準備出售之國營生產事業及敵僞產業中指定的單位，作為担保；美金公債應付本息，由政府特定之美金存儲備付。關於用途，短期庫券用在穩定金融；美金債券用在充實外匯基金，調劑對外貿易。關於發售辦法，依照央行美金牌價，以國幣折合美金發售，或以美金存款及其他外幣存款繳購，或以黃金繳購。並決議庫券及公債，均設基金管理會，辦理基金之監理事項。兩案的立法原則，交立法院後，昨日立法會議，已將立法程序完成，即將正式公佈庫券及公債兩項條例。這是「經濟緊急措旅方案」實施後，政府克服財政金融困難之一件新措施。</p>
<p>目「經濟緊急措施方案」公佈後，一般觀察家已考慮到政府對於預算的平衡，國內游資灰國外外匯存款的吸收，似將循取發行債券的途徑。在三中全會會議期間，原擬發行「物價指數公債，」這辦法在理論上很好，惟技術上問題很多，故未成議，因之日前國防最高委會，乃有上述兩種債券發行的決定。消息傳來後，上海金融界反響良好。咸認此際發行債券，實為一良好機會，可以收回法幣，可以納黃金外幣於正軌，並且利息甚高，人民必樂於購買；惟大家所關切的，還是用途問題。本來，國家的財政路綫，不外是租稅，公債與發行。租稅是有限的，且現今民力凋敝，租稅之路似將窮盡，所以不能積極走「加稅」「增稅」的路。發行現已創極高峯，不能再走這條危險的路。「經濟緊急措施方案」朱列有關發行的事項，似乎已覺察這條路再走不得。債券比較合理而正常，有用途有担保，並且有法律保障，在目前更是吸收游資的好機會。所以我們對這次兩種美元債券的發行，其看法與一般人相同、認此一措施可以吸收游資及外匯，可以吸收凍結中的黃金。</p>
<p>兩項債券的總　，計為四　美元，如以一萬二千元法幣合美元一元計、共為四萬八千億法幣，這數目確很應大，不能不慎重推行，慎重用途。關於推行方面、必須採用演泛推行的方式，上海的游資多由內地流入，應該推行到民間。不過推行到民間，首先要避免地方官吏的強迫　派，自毀倩券的信用，此不可不察！此其一；政府頒佈「經濟緊急指施方案」時，曾明令在外國有有的私人外匯，應向政府自行申報，由政府定期按照法定匯率收買。此項措施很賢明，深得　論的擁護，但是現在辦理的進度如何，頗有疑問，因之這次美金公債的發行，應該要外國存有外匯的人，首先承辦，甚至配合外交方式或政治強迫方式，也不算急躁。何况這對於外國人存金人有利，何樂不為？同時對於國家，也可以平衡國際收支，此其二；兩種債券到期的償付，立法院審議條例時，應該注意到債券流通性，必須加以保障；條例規定以美金付給要確實，姑不問將來外匯價格如何，均必須以美金支付，勿蹈往昔黃金儲蓄打折扣的錯誤。所以條例必須預防，必須預立行政救濟的條款。這就可以恢復政府的信用，此其三。關於用途方面，據消息所傳，為「穩定金融」，似有空泛之嫌。要之，四萬八千億法幣，在政府收縮通貨的時候，用途很大，必須支付得常，以服人心。如彌補今年大預算的赤字，是不可以的；日前國防最高委會決議，為平衡預算，核减者計一千四百六十四億元，緩至下半年支付者計八百五十億元，如果挽得住，如果勒得緊，應該不需要彌補，不需要追加，則財政收支自司維持平衡。財政收支既可平衡，此次債券收入，無疑應用於生產建設，以　極推動全國性的經濟建設。三中全會通過的「經濟改革方案」，眼光遠大，不失為根本之策。因之，以債券收入合理支付於經濟建設，較有意一，較有價值。如斯，人人必奮起　護，人人必爭購買，並且三中全會的重大決議，也不致落空！</p>
<h3>荷印關係的展望</h3>
<p>荷蘭與印度尼西亞於去年十一月十五日所商定之林伽牙締協定草案，已於廿五日簽字成立了。這個協定的要點有下列幾項：（一）荷蘭承認印度尼西亞共和國為爪哇·馬都拉·蘇門答臘三島事實上之政機；（二）印度尼西亞共和國將興婆羅　暨大東羣島，成立印度尼西亞聯邦；（三）印度尼西亞聯邦與荷蘭王國親成，荷印合眾國，以荷蘭女王為元首，惟共項聯北及合眾國，應於一九四九年一月一日成立；（四）荷軍在印度尼西亞所佔領之地區，應於一九四九年一月一日以前、　　交還印度尼西亞共和國；（五）荷印合眾國成立徒，荷關應介紹印度尼西亞聯　加人聯合國機構。這協定的草案、經過荷印尊方四個多月的深思熟慮，直到現在始能簽字，足見這個協定締結六非易，實在是一個難能可貴的協定，不僅可使繼續將近兩年的荷印慟突告一段落；而且也將替印度尼西亞獨立還動暨荷印兩國合作的前途，展開一幕美妙的遠景，誠如范莫克副總督所稱：『爭論與談判之時期已成過去，而發展友誼與合作，此其時矣。」我們無論為荷印雙方的利益計，或為南洋的和平暨我僑胞的權益計，對於這個協定的簽字，終是值得我們稱道的。王外長特為此事發表聲明，對於荷蘭承認印度尼西亞獨立表示欣慰，同時並盼望僑胞福利與安全從此即能獲得保障。這可以看作我國全國人民對於荷印問題所抱共同一致的態度。</p>
<p>綠自日本屈膝投降之徒，印度尼西亞的人民，即樹起民族獨立解放的大　，要求獨立與自主；荷蘭常局雖然洞悉戰後世界潮流的趨勢，同時並了解印尼人民的革命情緒，但是終覺得有些戀戀不捨，不肯立即放手，以致使日軍投降後的印度尼西亞，又成為荷印兩國衝突流血的場所。我國對於要求解放的印度尼西亞運動，自始至終，就表示同情，並盼望其獲得成功；惟我國在印度尼西亞有着三百萬的僑胞，所謂「城門失火殃及池魚」，他們的福利與安全，都遭受到空前嚴重的威脅，自然更為我們所關切。在繼續衝突十九個月的期間，我國僑胞生命財產的損失，實在無法統計，所以我們無時不希望荷印衝突能在合理的基礎上，早日獲得和平解決。到了去年十月杪，終算簽訂了一個停戰協定，雖使大規模的衝突不致再發生，但是雙方對峙的緊張情緒仍未能和綏。所幸范草克副總督與沙利爾總理，都是眼光遠大的政洽外交家，均能從遠處看，替大處着想，運用其政治家的　智，商定了這個協定的草案。</p>
<p>當這個協定的草案發表之後，不論在荷蘭國內或在印度尼西亞境內，都發生了軒然大波，尤其在荷蘭國內，大家都嚷着「帝國崩潰」和「向印尼革命投降」等口號，不僅輿論一致表示不滿，而且閣的意見，也不殊一致，幾乎要引起閣潮，但是經過范莫克的努力，再加以國際局勢的不容荷印繼續衝突下去，終於為荷蘭議會所通過。此在印度尼西亞境內，對於這個協定，也一致認為太空洞，而且有的地方模棱兩可，可作不同的解釋，但是經過沙利爾總理發表聲明：「這個條約不過是為」獨立而鬥爭的第一步而已」之後，各黨派也就在沙利爾領導之下，團結統一了。所以這個協定的草案一直遲延到現在簽字成立，實在是難能可貴的！</p>
<p>荷印雙方對於這個協定的解釋頗多矛盾之處，在實施的時候，固不免發生困難；但是我們終是希望荷印雙方，大家都能以國際信義為重，切實履行國際條約，萬萬不可因利害關係再生事　；使平靜的南洋再陷於動亂狀熊之中。所以我們渴望荷印兩國從此即能還嫌修好，不僅為雨國友誼及合作開闢一新途徑，而且也可替　拉問題樹立一新榜樣，中國人民對此，除了表示讚許而外，並發敦促我在印僑胞三百萬人，加倍努力，以助長新興的印度尼西亞共和國的繁榮與強盛，成為維持南洋和平唯一的安定力。</p>

<p>〔路透社莫斯科廿六日電〕四外長今日對於中國是否應為對德和會召集國之問題，爭辯良久，仍無協議。馬歇爾及貝文力主使中國為和會召集國之一，而莫洛托夫則堅決反對。綜述四外長就此一問題之辯述要點如下：莫洛托夫述及波茨坦協定，並日中國並非簽訂德國投降書之國，故不應為德國和會之召集國。貝文則以巴黎會議時就此一問題之討論為例，希望莫洛托夫不再在備國和約之討論中，重提應否為和會召集國之問題，當逕援巴黎和約之例，以中國為德國和會召集國，皮杜爾謂外長會議成立之初，法國並非其中之一份子，法國以為一俟德國和約之籌備工作完成後，四强應放棄彼等之特別地位，重新恢復為五强。馬歇爾提議中國旣為外長會議之一員，應獲得與在巴黎相同之地位。莫洛托夫繼曰，在巴黎時中國並非和會召集國，僅於和會召集以後為大會主席團之一份子而已，渠覺在德國和會中亦不防襲用此一辦法。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫期科廿六日電〕關於起草對德和約之程序，四國外長各報已見，相持不下已有多日。美國務卿馬歇爾本日在會議席上，一反往常緘默熊度，忽以尖刻之辭句發言，「會議枝節業生，不帝束蘭自縛，在其本身並無意義可言，但足使會議順和進展之機會益見渺茫。」因此四國外長對於起草對德和的之程序成立協議，其要點如次：（一）四國外長應繼續不斷開會；（二）在四外長開會期間，由四强及其他主要盟國曁有關各國代表所組織之顧問及情報會議亦同時開會；（三）在政治領土經濟及金融四常任委會開會期間，應受四强之指導。依照此項程序起草對德和的，作為召開對德和會工作之基礎，但對於各種團體之組成，意見仍未一致。同時尙有三項要點，亦未能成立任何決議，此即（一）被邀參加日後對德和會之同盟國家之名單；（二）中國應否為邀請國之一；（三）對德和的應吾由德政府簽署。四外長本日會議所獲致之唯一具體結果，乃為一致同意邀請南斯拉夫及義大利兩國推派代表列席會議，就解決特里埃斯德區之財政問題陳述意見。</p>
<h3>對奧和約陷僵局　蘇處置奧境個佔領區德資產　莫洛托夫謂美國無權過問</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕偷敦廿七日廣播：據悉莫洛托夫已向馬歇爾聲明，謂蘇聯對奧境蘇佔領區內德國資產之任何處置，均與美國無涉。按馬歇爾曾提出建議，以謀打開有關此等資產之僵局，今莫洛托夫旣已斷然加以拒絕，故對奧和的及早成立恊議之希望殊為黯淡。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科廿七日電〕據悉：莫洛托夫曾吿馬歇爾稱　蘇聯如何處理奧境蘇佔區內之德財產，與美國無關。莫氏並引一九四五年美大使哈里曼與蘇外决維辛斯基間之協定，哈里曼致維辛斯基附件中有「蘇聯政府得處理在芬，匈，保，羅，以及奧東部之「德國」財產，而不必與盟管會之英法美代表磋商，英法美亦可處理其他德國國外之財產，而不必與蘇聯商議。維辛斯基在其答文中對哈里曼之提議已表同意。莫洛托夫雖稱自由處理奧境德產，乃根據波茨坦協定，然英美與奧國指責蘇聯在奧境搬走許多非德國之工廠，故實破壞波茨坦之秘密協定。</p>
<h3>美駐外使節　將有大更動</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕據華府可靠方面消息宣稱：美國外交界現已進行整飭行動，在下週內或將有新任命及更調十數起以上。據稱，目前駐各國使節之即將出缺者，有菲律演。波蘭。葡萄牙。烏拉圭。哥斯德黎加。冰島與南斯拉夫各國之使節。即將開設之兩新使館為印度與傳說中之羅罵尼亞使館。</p>
<h3>美對丁政策不變</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿大日電〕國務院發言人宣稱：「美政府目前對西班牙政權所持之熊度；並不擬加以改變。美國派遺卡爾柏遜赴馬德里任一級秘書，並臨時代理公使一事，乃完全屬於行政事務方而之調動，亳無政治意義」。</p>
<h3>賴依突離美赴歐　是否負有任務不得而知</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約廿七日電〕據斯干的那維亞航空公司今日稱：聯合國秘書長賴依已向該公司汎大西洋空航機定位，於今晨亂美赴丹京與挪威京城。此行僅為作故國挪威之遊抑別有任務，尙難立即自聯合國方而獲知消息。斯干的挪維亞航空公司又稱：賴依又預購於四月七日之返美票。同時在成功湖方面，今日淸晨，賴依會在六月來第一次之新聞記者招待會上稱：渠深盼英國不久即謂求召開一聯合國特別大會，解決巴勒斯坦問題。據賴依宣佈：當渠接到此項請求後，渠對向各聯合國會員徵求關於此一提議之意見，如大多數會員贊成，渠在十五日內，即將召開特別大會。渠又稱：特別大會至少須用去五十萬美元。</p>
<h3>貝文調他職說　倫敦方面否認</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿六日電〕傳聞莫斯科會議結束後，貝文外相或將辭職，調任他部主持全國生產事宜，接近艾德禮首相者今日立即加以否認。據稱，首相「雖不在最近將來，終於或當改組內閣，但貝氏卸却外長一職殆不可能。貝文與莫里遜在工黨內部久為政敵，艾德禮不致黜此尊彼，益增冰炭。</p>
<h3>託管理事會首次會議　蘇聯無代表參加</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿六日電〕蘇聯今日拒不多加聯合國託管理事會首次會議，依照憲章，蘇聯為安全理事會常任理事資格，為託管理事會富然理事。聯合國重要機構會議而無蘇聯代表參加，自一年前蘇聯代表葛羅米柯以戲劇性方式退出安全理事會會塲以來，此為第一次。蘇聯之缺席雖未引起法理上之糾葛，却引起聯合國機構負責人間之關切，此輩鑒於重要問題避免聯合國機構之傾向日增，已感焦慮。蘇聯缺席之確定，恰在葛羅米柯行使否決權推翻安理會過半數表決支特英國對阿爾巴尼亞敷設水雷之控訴後廿四小時。秘書長賴依今日在開幕詞中亦表示關切之意，賴氏籲請聯合國全體會員國在所有各種國際問題上，運用此一和平機構，即使與國家生存攸關亦然。關於杜魯門總統各請國會援助希土及聲明聯合國機構現無力處置極權主義對各該國之威脅，賴伊並未直接提及。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處成功湖廿六日電〕聯合國託管理事會本日召開第一决會議，於是聯合國憲章中最後一個較大之機構，於此宣吿成立。各代表推選美代表薩爾担任第一任主席，其任期尙待決定。並選出紐西蘭之貝蘭森爵士當任副主席。</p>
<h3>八項託管草案　蘇曾堅決反對</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功湖廿六日電〕聯合國託管理事會召開首次會議時，並無蘇聯代表，蘇聯駐聯合國機構代表團於此亦未有解釋，但託管理事會之會議，仍照常進行。蘇聯之缺席，雖使人感覺若干不安，然並非意外之舉。上屆聯合國全體大會中提出八委治地之託管恊定草約時，蘇聯已曾表元堅決反對，其所提若干修正家，當時均遭否決，故其抵制託管理事會，原在意料之中。蘇聯反對該入個託管恊定軍案所據之理由如下：（一）協定中忽略「直接有關國」之利益，蘇聯認為五張應均為直接有關國，而根據憲章，託管恊定須得全體直接有關國之同意；（二）若干託管地之行政，被親為治理强國究整的一部份；（三）協定未得安全理事會之同意，擬在前委治土地設置武備；（四）委治疆國拒變設定期限以修改託管恊定。蘇聯之缺席並不影響理事留工作之程序，蓋在技術上蘇聯代表仍被視為列席也。</p>
<h3>杜魯門招待記者　希望國會迅即決定援助希土</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿六日電〕杜魯門總統本日舉行記者招待會，某記者發問稱：總統所採取之政策是否在準備戰爭，抑或在進備和平？杜魯門總統當即答曰：余希望余於三月十二日就援助希土兩國事所發表之聲明，對於促進世界和平將有所裨益，本人此項聲明，甚為明瞭，不加解釋，即可自明。至此，某記者提出問話曰：英國畀予希臘之財政援助將於三月卅一日停止，國會討論援助希土問題若遷延至彼時尙無結果，則總統是否認為有制定特別法案之必要？杜魯門總統答曰：本人希望國會對於援助希土兩國之計劃能迅速採取決定。至此又有託者發問稱：總統是否主張禁止美國國內之共產黨？杜魯門總統當即答稱：國會現正討論此一問題，余在此未便表示意見。關於國內問題，本人希望國內物價不致繼續上漲，若干美國商人已自動减低售價，深望工會因要求提高工資而與資方談判，不致使生活費用上漲云。</p>

<h3>賴加第亞　對希土案見解</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿六日常〕前紐約市長賴加第亞前曾以聯總署長資格，赴希臘及巴爾幹其他國家視察，今日本其經騐，對於杜魯門總統之拔助希臘土耳其案，在參議院外交委員會陳述意見稱：援助之舉應由聯合國機構而不應由美國單獨為之。「吾人單獨開步走入巴爾幹之時，即為吾人大不幸之日。巴爾幹方面局務，非朝夕問甚或十年內所能糾正。或須一代始克有濟」。賴氏勸吿美國不可造次「組成歐洲集團」。</p>

<h3>地方政治民主基礎奠定　首憑民選區長宣誓　潘議長致詞希望造成新市風　吳市長監誓禮成後茶會招待</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全市三十區民選正副區長，於昨日下午三時在市府大禮堂舉行宣餐就職典禮。到各區正副區長社維垣，程經遠等六十人。吳市長，宜司令，潘議長，市府何秘書長，地政局祝局長，衛生局張局長吸民政處張處長等均參與典禮。行禮如儀後，即由黃浦區正區長程經遠領導舉行宣誓，誓詞為『余敬宣誓，余格遵國父遣囑奉行三民主義，服從法令，尊重地方人民公意，忠心努力於本戰，決不營私舞弊及接受賄賂，如有違背誓言，願受最嚴厲之處罰，此誓」。</p>
<p>宣誓畢，即由監誓人吳市長致訓調稱，有三點感想：（一）上海為我國第一大都市，在市參議會潘　長領導下，正走向民主道路。此次區長民選，要看民主政治是否能達到理想，全視各區畏執行如何，故責任重大。（二）英美國家都市並無區長制，今本市首决實行此制，是成是敗是好是壞，全視各區長辦理成績如何，此不但關係全國，抑且影響國際，故望各區長能協助政府，使該制度確切樹立，以推行民主政治。（三）經濟與社會秩序皆特安定，政治需要興革，但欲求安定，固需地方政府，參議會與軍警機關共同努力，一方面猶需各區長作政府與人民中間之橋樑，使政府意思能下達人民，人民滿苦能呈訴至政府，司舟共齊，以度難關。</p>
<p>繼由潘議長致詞稱：勝利不到兩年，本市已將地方政治眞正之民主基礎建立。但收效如何，試騐好壞，猶待看此第一任民選區長之如何做法，校有校風，市有市風，太市以往因租界關係，藏垢納污，被稱為罪惡淵藪。今不平等條約已取消，吾人在吳市長領導下欲改革面目，共同努力以造成一種新的市風。吳市長接在以來，能興民親近，時至鄉區訪問考察，以求民間疾苦。希各區長亦能與民接近，為民服務，達到民之所好好之，民之所惡惡之，興利除弊，則地方自治規模建立，民主政</p>
<p>宣司令亦致詞稱：訓政時期國民黨代替人民行使政權，現值憲政開始，政府還政於民，各區長既自民選而來，則當此民主政治實施之初，是否像樣，各位責任重大。今日上海需要安定，但有盜匪奸徒滋擾，祗憑軍警防治，難期肅清。希各區長就憑後，自治力量能高度發揮，以協助政府肅清一切不良因素。最後由程經遠代表各區長致答詞稱：在此複雜環境中受地方父老選舉出任，自感責任艱鉅，今後希各長官龍時予指示。典禮至四時乃告結束。吳市長復於五時紹舉路警察俱樂部茶會招待各區長，並邀宣司令，潘議長及各局處長作陪。席間交換意見，甚為融洽。</p>

<h3>中紡公司招待記者　參觀工廠三單位　機器設備大部紡製細支紗　紡織染各門均有密切聯繋</h3>

<p>第二紡織廠</p>
<p>前身為內外第五廠，紗錠有四六，四〇〇枚，綫錠有二三，〇〇〇枚，佔地共四十二畝，該廠機器設備，尚係一九一三年份所造，接收時僅能開數千錠，刻已全部開足。去年共產紗一萬二千餘件，為折合廿支樑準紗，每日可產一百十餘件。該廠設備，適於紡製四十二支棉紗、最高能舫製八十支。</p>

<p>將其逮捕</p>
<p>據供：一名朱晉保。一名劉文彬，對扒直需不諱，當將一一犯於廿五日下午移送地檢處，但於當日傍晚即行取保釋放。詎其賊心未死，於决（廿六）日下午二時復至北站「貼生意」，冒充旅客，正擬動手時，即遭探員張明操所獲，當時僅獲朱晋保一名，劉文彬則已乘機脫逃。朱犯被押解至段本部復加戰詢，並</p>
<p>查閱舊卷</p>
<p>始得悉該犯係著名扒黨「五虎將」主腦之一，自敵僞時期迄今，始終盤踞北站，專在滬杭路行使扒竊，先後犯案纍纍，數以千計。勝利後該犯等一度為三方面軍所獲，不久即行釋出，然賊性不改，仍至北站操舊案，先後遭該處逮捕十餘次之多。該犯對過去一切，均直認不諱，路警處以眞組已明，決予緝捕同黨，至朱晋保則定日內送法院究辦。</p>

<h3>花壇審結　埋毒案含嗎啡成份　僅千分二三　辯稱不能視為毒品</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕林森中路大德里三十一號花壇中發現埋藏姻土案，昨日地院續審，並俱至第一被告裴元俊之要何蘭君，及其隣居徐定國作證，被告裴元俊（屋主），周阿三（花匠），施兆光（前業主）所供，大致謂花壇中藏有毒品，絕未預知，雖曾經周阿三一度發現，然亦因不識毒物，未加注意。二澄人亦證明裴元俊未曾販毒。庭上諭稱，花壇中掘得之姻土一千另五十八公斤，曾送往市衛生局化騐，其中含嗎啡成份最高量為千分之三點五，最低為千分之二點九，如此鉅量毒品藏於家中，豈竟毫不知情。後據被告辯護律師辯稱，普通鴉片含嗎啡常在千份之一百以上，而掘得之毒物，含毒成份既如此微少，當已不能視為毒品矣。該處房屋前曾為「嗎啡大王」葉淸和故居，故該批毒物，可能為當時葉在鴉片中提練嗎啡後之餘渣，因避外人注意，故埋置花壞中，被告等自無藏毒嫌疑云。辯論終結後，庭諭本案定四月三日宣判。</p>

<h3>台灣統制圖書文具</h3>
<p>民營書局感受威脅</p>
<p>〔本報台北訊〕台省一切特殊，一切統制，內地尙無官辦書局，而台省得風聲之先，獨設立官辦之台灣書店，編印圖書，兼營文具，於是圖書文具亦在統制之列，曾由長官公署明令通飭所屬，所有圖書文具一律向台灣書店採購，其實台雀多係公立學校，即屬於長官公署，於是全省學校所需之圖書文具，亦由官廳一手包辦。此次春銷，小學敎科書大都採用台灣書店版本。而七聯之一之「開明」，將國定本國常敎科書獨自加印注音符號發售，總算獲利倍蓰。其他各家書局兼程自滬運台之國定本敎科書，幾至無人問津，虧蝕至鉅。據某書局負責人談：此種不正常之變態，如繼續存在，正當民營之書局，深感威脅，除及早忍痛結束營業，與台胞黯然吿別外，別無其他生存之途云。</p>

<h3>滬江學生罷課　提出二項要求</h3>

<p>金元霖技術較佳，但體力略差，當以巧取勝，徐國華黃美娟小姐為聯賽混合雙打冠軍，從未失落一局，而以徐個人球藝論，確屬極具希望，但須看黃之能否搭擋耳，李國璠潘綠芙小姐之合作功夫，似較徐黃為佳，兩人曾獲今歲上海體運會會員羽球賽混雙錦標，潘於日前勝强敵羅柴遼，實力可知。</p>

<h3>業中大戶賣氣濃厚　統債慘跌洋股回疲　丙種午後已降至萬一以下</h3>
<p>公債昨銳氣見减，六四五室仍加拋售，債市大戶賣氣濃厚，買風暫歛，統丙自晨開一八〇〇〇元起，盤低至一四五〇〇元低價結束，結果較前收計甲乙丙各跌二千元，丁降一千九，戊挫一千七，成交的千餘萬元，午後在業中大戶之做手下，竟再慘跌至一一〇〇〇元以下，環境旣吿轉　，助賣流言遂起，散戶又慘遭沒頂矣。</p>
<p>外股昨初以散多及證券帮之爭先了結，上塲頗疲，惟猶太商及業外游資仍吸，中途復堅，午後稍見回降而轉盤，怡紗晨初低價二二五〇〇元後，即吿回升至二四四〇〇元結束，午後退入二四〇〇〇元內，結果較前收計業廣微升，航業跌半成，會德豐紙業平平，餘均微降。</p>
<h3>銀根鬆濫假期近　華股市塲交易稀</h3>
<p>華股昨更為閑散，多方心灰意懶，檯面鬆濫逾恒，遞永紗更見遜色，以致掉期貼價竟低至六分左右。午後銀行帮之多頭亦有了結。晨開低盤，人心虛弱，遞永紗上塲，低渦現交，形成倒掛。初自二二五〇元，升至二三〇〇元，美亞商務跌停，亦隨跌至二一六〇元。嗣又進至二二三〇元。入後多空除掉期外，別無新活動，市况徘徊。十一時後，盤高至二二八〇元，近午又退入二二〇〇元內，午收稍盤。結果較前收計永紗信和美亞華豐新光景福勤興中法各跌半成至一成弱，新華跌一成强。遞交因前日祗半天交易，是以華豐新光景福跌一成弱，永紗天亞信和各跌一成强，冷股商務跌停後有回，中絲新亞平平，餘均微挫迄跌半成强不等。掉期因多方不愿留戀，貼價自五五元步降至三五元以下，由銀行帮及一六八號二二號一三七號等貼進，合息價不過五分至七分。</p>
<p>午後責風更盛，缺乏維持，遞永紗步降至二一二〇元，永業及遞美亞均吿跌停，交易不多，市情閑散，臨收尙定，結果較前收計永紗中法新華各降一成弱，信和美亞華豐各降半成强，新光景福跌半成，勤興微挫。遞交因前日僅半天交易，軋跌較多，計永紗信和美亞跌一成强，華豐挫落一成，新光量福跌半成强，冷股永業跌停，商務上午跌停後有回，中絲上午平平，下午因增資暫停，新亞平平，火柴麗安水泥各跌一成左右，餘股各降少許迄半成强不等。塲外各股除閘北水電外，餘均見挫。</p>
<h3>二千五新鈔　央行昨發行兩種</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕中央銀行昨晨起，發行兩千五百元法幣兩種，一為綠色，由華南印刷公司承印，一為藍色，為大東書局承印，其花紋與普通流行鈔券，大致彷彿，聞係勝利前重慶印製云。</p>
<h3>粳米回漲千元　洋莊生仁價狂瀉</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧七千七百餘石，市布化動而不旺。秈米仍趨平平之格，白元高俏决呆，陰元提高殺次，惟粳米收市略呈起色，回漲千元之譜。</p>
<p>麵粉貨主索價雖堅，奈實銷淸淡，欲振無力，仍無榮辱，祗下等統粉醬園銷路尙可，略挺三五百元。麩皮鄉銷甚懈，少神乏交。黃豆客帮船位已滿，進胃見淡，油廠納胃亦懈，轉趨呆平之局。豆餅汕頭去路已轉冷淡，止漲轉跌，下挫七八百元。</p>
<p>赤豆廣方去化香燥，步砌一二千元。菉豆南洋消化活靈，市面挺秀。苞米交易仍呆，疲中徘徊。紅糧酒精廠動辦，回漲二三千元。生仁洋莊停辦，動蕩甚烈，在瀉萬元。芝蔴堅定，油市亦趨軟化。生油塲外續挫六七千元，蔴油猛跌萬元，淸油亦低三五千元。</p>
<h3>外銷茶交易稀</h3>
<p>陰霾多時之紅緣茶內銷，以本街及客帮去化，依然處於狹隘範國，仍鮮開朗之夠用，而市勢則因持貨者心思尙平，是以賡續徘徊不隊。至洋莊交易，益呈江河日下之局面，良以供售賣戶雖不絕，惟進購者對售價前途始終看跌，因此一再裹足，情况遂更閑散。行情在此種情形下，亦頻趨鬆懈，陣綫俱有後退之景象。</p>
<h3>飾金議價問題　社會局認為增加過多　今日再與各代表商談</h3>
<p>本市銀樓集代表姚聯芳，姚桂卿，吳彭年，裘　良，陳德新等五人，昨日午後三時赴社會局晋謁吳局長開先，並將該公會所議定之營業費用，（一）包括耗金及提鍊費一萬八千元，（二）利息三萬四千五百元，（三）包紥二千五百元，（四）捐稅三千八百元，（五）其他三千元，（六）合法利潤四萬五千元，共計每兩十萬〇六千八百元〇呈請社會局核定。吳氏當表示增加過多，允予轉請市長再行決定，並囑各代表今日前往社會局商談云。</p>
<h3>大片圓肉續升</h3>
<p>大片圓肉近以乏到，號存漸薄，而產價劃申倒懸，故開價轉堅，昨市開出數箱，又升萬元。</p>
<h3>羊毛原料配委會決定　鐵木機折合標準</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕羊毛類原料分配委員會，關於紡錠分配限額標準，已於日前開會決定。至於織機方面分配辦法，由該委員會葛傑臣吳善賡二委員，召集織廠代表王厚甫，童雙揚，黃錦篆等，於昨日下午三時，在毛紡公會開會討論，決定標準如次：雙幅鐵木機等於1/2鐵機，單幅鐵機鐵木機等於1/4鐵機，駝絨圓機等於二鐵機，駝絨平機等於一鐵機，海勃龍鐵機等於1/2鐵機，海勃龍木機等於1/4鐵機。</p>
<p>又該會以本年二月至四月之羊毛進口限額，僅美金一百四十萬元，該業殊感難於分配。綠：（一）照該項限額，僅敷該業所需原料十分之一，結果各廠每月僅能開工四日。（二）一百四十萬元之限額中，二十五萬五千元須歸毛織廠，紡廠僅存一百十四萬五千元。各廠不敷之數，勢須求諸黑市，然價已較限額進口貨高出二倍。（三）滬市現僅存原料七十萬磅，尙不敷該業一月之需。（四）將來分配原料，為簡捷計，織廠望以鐵機為單位。全部織機，約合鐵機二百七十單位。紡廠方面，以紡錠〇·四磅，細紗〇·五磅，粗紗〇·六磅，粗紡環錠一磅為準。以上各點，該會將函呈輸管會限額分配處，請求照辦云。</p>
<h3>收購茶葉　國庫不能負担盈虧　辦法將全部變更　中央銀行擬轉向政院請示</h3>
<p>茶商以出口困難，去年迭請政府收購，當蒙行政院前院長宋子文批准。有關機關隨即將收購細節，簽報政院，本年亦得宋院長之批准。中央銀行即與有關機關着手開始辦理。一面通知財政部，對收購之盈虧，由國庫負担。上月以外匯放長，茶商復要求多予資助，最近經中央銀行劉副總裁召集茶商代表，商訂打包放款及外銷辦法，正擬分報政院及四聯總處核辦間，適接得財政部復函謂：國庫無此項預算，對收購茶葉之盈虧，不能負担，請中央銀行再轉政院請示辦理。中央銀行接函後，以國庫旣無是項預算，原收購辦法，已失効用，除再向政院請示外並將財部來函，通知茶商。據中央銀行負責人表示：今後辦法如何，雖難逆料。但相信政府對出口茶業，當另謀辦法補救，中央銀行，仍盡力予以扶助。聞中央銀行，擬邀請茶商代表交換意見，以便轉報政院。</p>
<h3>台糖照舊配售</h3>
<p>昨台糖公司又値配售之期，價格仍舊，包額照前，計配赤砂五成，四半車白二成，二四粗白三成。公會劃盤依然堅挺。現貨二二中砂白原價不動，次之雙袋廿二萬元，單袋廿二萬四千元。二四粗白升萬餘元，棧單升五六千元，四半軍白棧單升六七千元，三半軍白升八九千元，秘魯細砂為二十一萬八九千元至二十二萬元，升萬元。下週一期二十二萬二千元，號貨開出汕提靑十三萬九千元，順德靑十三萬三千元，刁靑十三萬元，興化白二十萬〇二千元至二十萬元，次之十九萬八千元，興赤十三萬四千元至十四萬元，成交三百餘件。</p>
<h3>絲綢成交甚少</h3>
<p>人造絲跌風已止，昨市與上日價相同。一二〇號高山有光開盤五百九十二三萬元，並無成交，下午又喊高至六百〇五萬元賣出，結果與上日軋平。一〇〇號無光簡子貨，喊價八百六十萬元價、出。廠絲昨市E字等級做開十餘担，價七百萬元。零祖少有交易，千輕五担貨有單子，仍絨五百八十萬至六百萬元之間。綢貨市况寂靜，喊價一仍其舊，成交數量極徵。良因秋冬貨已落令無去路，而夏貨因天氣寒冷，買方俱存觀望遷延，有以致之。</p>
<h3>淡色呢羢暢銷</h3>
<p>昨呢羢諸市塲，標準行情仍與上前日相彷，除要爾登受外行有大量放出，兼天時銷令關係，而趨下游外，餘均明穩暗定。淡灰花呢同業各號均頗軋缺，趨勢因此較為俏秀，紅黃藍緣靑灰之各種女色呢，市銷頗見廣暢，本客各帮，咸有相當需要。蓋其吃本較男色呢絨為輕，利益則不殊惡。現在春季和暖，旗袍料夾大衣盛銷之際，零躉交易因此更盛。來路貨及本廠出品，市貨供給因此亦甚充斥。頭號女色呢普通齊售十餘萬元，二號七八萬元，三號五六萬元，四號二三萬元。</p>
<h3>沖繩島剩餘物資　西藥部份將應市</h3>
<p>製藥業方面消息，我國購自美國冲繩島之剩餘物資，僅西藥一項，即値美金一億元以上，供足全國五年之需，該項藥品大部份已運抵滬市，尙有一小部份正在裝運中。其業已運抵滬市部份，即將應市，且定價相當低廉。現該業正在集議，將要求政府在配售時附　部份國　西藥，同時希望能將原有美製商標改為物　供應局之標貼，俾免代表貨宣傳云。</p>
<h3>本年茶貸原則　決定就地申請</h3>
<p>頃據農行消息，今年茶貸原則已決定，由各茶商至採購區（例如安徽，屯溪，祁門，浙江，杭州，紹興，溫州，湖南，湖北等地）就地申請貸放，至茶貸貸放總額及貸放細則，頃悉：四聯總處與農行，已在加緊研討，短期內即將公佈施行。</p>
<h3>桐油千餘噸　裝船出口</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日來桐油有千餘噸裝船出口，輸往美國，據悉：此項桐油，係於數月前向紐約拋出者，至最近內外價格，已達接近之時，輸出將大大减少。記者多方訪問桐油出口情形，咸以為外價釘住不動，內價尙無下降，出口商在無利可圖之情形下，或不致輸出，惟產區新油登塲在即，內價或將因貨多而貶便，漢口及長沙產區，預計下月份桐油鄉貨，將大量湧銷於市塲，彼時價看軟化。本年交通情形，已較前好轉甚多，苟此時產區價能抑低至每市祖三十萬以內，則本年當可增加出口，昨市現貨做開每市担大市面為三十入萬元，連桶四十二萬元，門售四十萬元。定度到貨轉稀，西洪絡繹有小量抵埠，客戶運滬銷售者頗少，運到之貨，均係行商向產地收購運滬者。</p>
<h3>水泥工業同業公會　開首屆理事會議　顏惠慶等當選常務理事</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國水泥工業同業公會，於昨日下午三時，召開首屆理事會議，出席全體理事廿一人，監事亦均列席。當公推顏惠慶為臨時主席，互選常務理事，結果顏惠慶。劉鴻生。陳光甫。張峻。陳範有等五人當選。並互選顏惠慶為理事長，討論提案共十起：</p>
<p>（一）通過該會工作綱領，其要點：（甲）關於生產，（乙）關於運輸，（丙）關於技術，（丁）關於研究。（二）討論通過該會卅六年度經費收支預算案，俟下屆屆會員大會開會時，再提出追認。（三）討論通過該會事務所（在南京），曁辦事（上海一處）組織規程。（四）討論通過該會辦事細則。（五）決定該會辦事處設立地點，暫以上海一處為限。（六）聘任陳漢淸為總幹事，奚正脩為副總幹事。（七）呈請主管官署備案及頒發印信。</p>
<p>（八）抗戰期間，水泥工業受害頗重，擬由該會將各廠損失詳細統計，呈請政府交涉拆卸日廠設備，移作賠償，以利復興。綠該會據各方消息，日本盟軍總帥部核准對華賠款拆遷之日本工業十種中，獨缺水泥工業。而據查戰前日本水泥工業，頗為發達。生產總量，除半數自用外，尙有餘額半數可供外銷。故將根據該項調查，交涉拆卸日廠設備，移作賠償。（九）經濟部工業標準委員會函送所訂水泥標準一份，囑轉知採用一案，決議，組織審查委員會，推定王松濤。徐宗凍。庾宗溎。陳範有。陸宗賢。等五人為委員，一俟審查竟事，即呈部核定。</p>
<p>（十）啓新洋灰公司華北水泥公司等，提請交涉擴充蕭袋輸入限額，及開放石膏紙袋進口，決議授權總幹事副總幹事洽辦。綠按本年二月至四月蔴袋限額，僅美金一百廿五萬元。此數可購緣錢蔴袋一百五十萬只。如購八十五公斤裝水泥袋，僅可得二百廿七萬只。全部述口蔴袋，僅可裝水泥十入萬九千屯，每月僅可裝水泥六萬三千屯。且單以華北之啓新。華北。久大。永利等洛工廠每月之需要量而言，已需蔴袋廿五萬只，故全部　袋限額，尙不敷華北一地之需。水泥紙袋，刻國內亦無法自製。而石膏又為水泥　主要原料之一，需佔全都原料額百分之三，全部又需仰給外洋，故亟宜設法放寬其輸入限額，否則水泥集將無法繼續生產。</p>
<h3>紗市轉趨下游</h3>
<p>昨日紗市轉趨下游，客銷寂如止水，亳無動靜。上日紡建配出之貨，一般迫於銀根者，貶價求脫，致念支紗下降五萬至十萬，人心因是轉庸，趨勢仍是盤旋之局也。</p>
<h3>小額票面鈔票　央行收回焚燬</h3>
<p>自中央銀行發行五千元及二百五十元五百元關金後，如一，五，十、五十元等數字鈔票，央行雖未禁止，市面上已不再流通，央行為維持通貨之信譽，特令全國各地分行及請中國，中農，交通三行，郵儲中信二局代為收回，其中以農民銀行及郵儲匯局之分支機構遍設於各地，故收效頗大，該行又為避免化費大量運費，對各地收到小額鈔票，均就地封存，並定期請當地行政機關首長，財政部經濟部市商會及該行發行局業務局稽核處派員會同焚燬，各地居民倘現仍執有小額鈔票，仍可向當地四行二局兌換。</p>
<h3>紐約滬鬃再挫　出口少交易萎頹</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕猪鬃賈氣衰颯，紐約滬鬃每磅由二元美金再挫至一元九角，川鬃價更軟化。漢鬃尙站三元五角之盤價，昨日市塲做開不多，最近出口至為稀少。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕天祥洋行經理之德梅拉爾號，昨晨離滬駛美，裝有猪業一千餘箱，毛類六百餘箱，山羊皮卅八件，茶葉約六百箱，業運往紐約。又江建輪昨自漢返滬，運來大批棉花烟葉，棉花二千五百餘件，烟葉三千八百餘件。</p>
<h3>木材交易清淡</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨市洋松，鋸方，三夾板等，仍維原盤，實銷清稀，杉木條子，脚地雖輭，但因輸船水脚增加，福建下力亦增，市氣已漸鬆動。</p>
<h3>瀋陽糧價上漲</h3>
<p>〔本報潘陽廿七日電〕瀋陽糧價，近又不斷上漲，大米每斤由九十元流通券漲至一百卅元，高梁米六千五百元，麵粉每斤二百八十元，牛肉每斤二百八十元，猪肉每斤二百廿元。</p>

<h3>麻疹漫談</h3>
<p>— 謝壽</p>
<p>（一）關於麻疹的發生</p>
<p>為什麼發生麻疹？恐怕是一種濾過性么微體作祟。這樣么微體，存在於病人血液裏面；而淚液，鼻涕，喀痰中，當然也有存在，所以很容易從咳嗽，噴嚏等直接傳染到他人的身上。</p>
<p>麻疹發生的時期，大多在晚秋冬期和春期，差不多每年如此，但是牠能隔上幾年，會盛大的流行一次；有時隔二三年，有時隔五六年，這因為一年盛大流行的時候，凡是居民有感受性的，幾乎全部被感染，而就得到一種免疫性，所以大流行經過了以後，有幾年的平靜。在這幾年的平靜當中，新生的小兒，他們當然還沒有經過麻疹的感傳，或則免疫性因某種原因而消失的時候，遂引起麻疹的第二次大流行。</p>
<p>乳兒的罹患，比較的少，因為乳兒常常臥在褥中，和外界兒童的接觸的機會很少，並且用母乳營養的乳兒，可以從母乳方面得到母親的免疫體，多少有些免疫性，所以用人工營養的乳兒，麻疹感傳的預後，往往不良。</p>
<p>麻疹的傳播，多起於家庭裏面或是戶外的小兒間，最重要的是學校，因為麻疹患者，雖在潛伏期（就是旣己傳染麻疹，還沒有發現的時候，醫學上呌潛伏期，）當中，外觀雖沒有任何症候，已經有傳染力，能够傳染給他人。</p>
<p>大人發生麻疹的極少，因為大多在小兒期中已經發生，旣然發生過以後，就得到一種免疫性的緣故。</p>
<p>（二）麻疹的症候</p>
<p>麻疹從牠的經過，可以分作四期：第一期就是潛伏期；大約有十天，病兒多沒有甚麼症候。第二期呌做前驅期：忽然發生三十九度到四十度的高熱，大約一天，翌晨就下降，同時有鼻涕，噴嚏，眼紅，流淚，咳嗽，頭痛，胃口不開等，好似感冒的狀態，經過大的三四天。在這期中，還有初期的粘膜發疹，就是在口腔，咽頭，軟口蓋等處，發生圓形暗赤色的斑點。診斷上最重要的，就是在頰粘膜和日齒相對的部份，發生靑白色稍稍隆起的斑點，呌做可卜立克氏斑。第三期呌做發疹期：就是體溫，忽然再高昇起來，比較第一次的熟還要高，有時竟到四十度以上，於是開始在顏面部份，發生淡赤色的丘疹，形狀為類圓形或多角形，有時互相融合，但是疹和疹的中問，必定有健康的皮膚。這樣的發疹，急速從顏面向軀幹上部，上膊，驅幹下部，上腿，前膊，手，下腿，足部，蔓延開來，佈滿全身，做父母的看到小兒足底已經有了紅疹，就開心起來。在這時候，鼻涕眼淚，特別增多，同時咳嗽也極甚。此外，還有頭痛，口渴，胃口不開，有時竟有譫語，痙攀等等。發疹遍布以後，逐漸消退，全部的發疹期，大的四五天。第四期：皮膚發疹，漸次退色，上皮落屑，各種　膜發炎症候，也逐漸消退，這就呌做恢復期了。</p>
<p>（三）麻疹的可怕</p>
<p>麻疹可以說是一種輕易的疾病，因為任何人都要經過，並不見到都送了性命，可是據各國的統計，一萬名的小孩常中，因為麻疹而死亡的，在日本有一·五；在英國有一一·四；在德國有六·八；在瑞士有五·三；在蘇聯有三〇·四；在意大利有六。七。吾國還沒有精確的統計，吾們從臨症上詢問病歷的時候，知道小兒患麻疹而死亡的，着實不少。</p>
<p>講到麻疹本身的疾病，如果經過善良的話，並沒有可怕的地方，就是幾種變型；譬如丘疹性麻疹，融合性麻疹，水痘性麻疹，出血性麻疹，也沒有甚麼大不了的事情。只有一種呌做黑色麻疹的，就是發生於有出血性素因的小兒，那牠的經過就不良。</p>
<h3>睡之新位置</h3>
<p>— 王往仁</p>
<p>多數動物之天性，非到死時，絕不平睡，無論其人有病或無病，終日貼背平睡，為期過久，最不相宜，若其人局部之病需開割，甫施外科手術，誤任平睡，弊患至多，一則易釀肺臟之發炎，二則或至肺葉摺合，而不良於呼吸，其第三一項最危迫，是即以於「血液凝固Trombosis」於腿部，不獨為突患腿腫之「原因」，而且可致血塊「栓塞Emboli」肺部動脈管，驟停呼吸而遭喪失生命之『結果』，從來孕婦臨盆，因生產而流血，與甫經開割之病體略同，在分娩後之十日以內，頗多危險。</p>
<p>歐洲向例，在分娩之九天以後恒起床，而照新說，則謂五天以後，即可起坐休息，此因睡過久者，除有上述三項危險外，尙易發生筋肉失營養而『萎縮Atrophy』，肢體因不活動而僵硬之第四種病患。</p>
<p>凡人如多動，則血易流通，而筋肉多得營養，今美國空軍病院之對待傷兵，使不起床之輩，多作腿之運動，其運動之方式，不止一端，大抵使效騎脚踏車以前進者之交互靈動。</p>
<p>同時，尙有預防「血凝固』之另一法，即使其人所睡之床，足部高而近頭之一方面略低下，使作四十五度之欹斜，此法有助於肺呼吸，兼免肺部之發炎，今各國新式病院共喻此旨，已漸改置此項斜上之床矣。</p>

<h3>痔瘡</h3>
<p>— 蘇復</p>
<p>大多數痔瘡的患者，除了大便時候痛苦之外，最通常的是便血，對！痔瘡的西文名字是Hemorrhoid-Hemo。這個字的意義，是關於血的意思。原來在肛門的四周，有很多的血管，這種小血管，他們互相連通的佈滿着，一且去路不通，他們就把血液囤積起來，這個小小的囤戶，愈囤愈多，結果就高聳滿漲，一遇到外力的傾軋，——大便排出的時候，血液就此奪圍而出，這樣的日積月累，當然造成了貧血，涓滴之水，可成江河，雖然是小小的隱疾，後果的確相常的嚴重。</p>
<p>本來血液應當很順利的流通的，可是有很多習慣性的便秘者，大便變成硬塊，聚結在直腸，壓迫了肛門附近血管的去路，大便的時候，用力的漲着，血管更加澎漲，因果循環，由於便秘而生痔瘡，由於痔瘡，更加便秘，所以痔瘡的預防！第一要使大便的通暢，這是個根本之源。</p>
<p>有人說吃酒的人，很容易生痔瘡，事實上的確如此。吃酒的人容易生肝病，肝臟中的血管，醫學名稱呌門脈，而肛門附近的血管，是與門脈相運的，肝病之後，門脈的流通就要起障礙了，間接就影響到肛門附近血液的流通，當然造成囤積血液的機會，而致痔瘡的病源。</p>
<p>女子懷孕的時候，肚子裏裝了個新的生命，阻迫母體下部的血流，所以有脚腫等情形，肛門附近的血管，叨為隣居，也就敬陪末座了。在生產的時候，好比萬馬奔騰，用盡力氣，想把小孩擠出來，所有力氣，都是向下，一方面本來就血流不暢，再加上這個一擠，肛門附近的血管更加成功大腹賣了，所以生產的時候肛門上邊的陰道裏伸出個小頭來，肛門麥也擠出了一團東西。來的時候，他是順流而下，去的時候，到不大容易請回去了。所以假使我們的母親有痔瘡的話，實在是兒子之過，想到了母親的痔瘡，更要盡我們的孝道。</p>
<p>許多文化工作者，地們大都數時間是坐的，等而下之，許多賭鬼，終日沉迷於牌桌上，缺少運動，血流因之不暢，下積於肛門附近，也容易生痔瘡，所以我們要時常遝動，不無關係。</p>
<p>至於說外痔與內痔，這不過生的部位之不同，我們可以不必多去計較。</p>
<p>因為痔瘡是有說不出來的不舒服和隱痛，所以大都先想搽點藥，內痔的話，局部打點針，希望自己消掉，可是或許稍見功效，或許愈而復發，病者希望一服而愈，藥到病除，醫生呢，力不從心，到後來，大多是施行手術，手術的結果，很可能復發，復發之後，當然怪前一位醫生的不好，再請第二位醫生來醫治，其實可笑得很，病人照常在狂歡，日夜在打牌，還是便秘，接連生產，沒有解決根源，當然不會好了。生產當然沒有辦法，只有產科醫生。臨時當心一些。可是其他種種生活的改良，習慣的從善，並不太難，回頭是岸。</p>
<p>肛門附近的病，除了痔瘡，還有很多，不能併為一談，如肛門裂隙，也可有大景的出血，肛門周圍炎更是痛不可當，脫肛也有很大的一塊突出，痔瘻，我們鄉下呌偷糞老鼠，常常流膿水，雖然各有原因，不過對於大便的通順和肛門附近的淸潔，不無關係。故患痔的人們。我希望你。每次大便後。用水洗滌肛門。平日多飲水。多吃水菓和素菜。多運動。甚至用甘油錠。或灌賜均可。總之使大便天天暢通，是為至要。</p>
<p>痔瘡，這是俗稱，科學的名稱呌痔核或痔。</p>
<h3>醫藥通問</h3>
<p>答張新新吾李啟範兩君</p>
<p>（一）通俗稱手淫為非法出精，事實上遺精亦非法出精之一種。雖一則故意的，一非故意的；而其為病則一也。是故年靑人犯手淫者，最易患遺精。而欲愈遣精者，自亦以光戒手淫為不二法門。</p>
<p>（二）遺精又與神經衰弱互為因果：即遺精過度者，足以引起神經衰弱；而神經衰弱者，亦足以引起遺精。凡不犯手淫而患遺精者，大都由神經衰弱而起。澳劑如溴化鉀澳化鈉，能鎭靜過敏之神經，為神經衰弱之對症藥；故亦可兼治遺精。</p>
<p>（三）還精未必為致命疾息，對於發育，更無問題；故患者不必過抱悲觀。一方面固宜求醫；一方面更當奮勵精神。如果精神振作，意志堅定；即不服藥，亦可愈遣精。</p>
<p>（四）此外患糖尿病，脊髓癆，攝護腺炎者，間亦引起遺精。但屬少數；自當由專門家診治。且除遺精一端外，尙可發覺原病應有一切症狀。故容易與普通人所患之遺精區別，茲不多賢。（馬殿）</p>

<h3>川味</h3>
<p>— 閻哲吾</p>
<p>（一）第一印象</p>
<p>舟過三峽，峭壁淺灘，峯迥路轉，沿山橘林，點點朱紅，處處皮香，入川的第一印象，便是冬令的紅橘柑與川人的白頭中！紅橘柑在今古奇觀上還有段記載，彷彿入蜀者曾引為致當之道，想不到若干年代以後，西蜀也大種橘林！在川中過了八年，每冬橘柑成堆的買置在家裏，有時拷了吃，還有時專門熬成了「橘醬」。在入川的第一年，愛吃橘柑幾乎成了癖！後來小住江安，遊過橘林！易居北碚，更在嘉陵江邊橘船上成百地整購，乃至跑到橘林中親自採擷這，間的樂趣至今還覺盎然！據說四川的水菓橘柑袖子西瓜等統是外省移植來的，尤以隨廣東流民移來四川的為最多。</p>
<p>白頭中係是下江人帶的「孝布」，據說當年本是為諸葛武侯誌喪。但川中山嵐到處，易致腦痛，所以人民多以白布包紥頭部，以代便帽，也是一種原因。</p>
<p>這白頭中在抗戰期問，因為敵機空襲關係，會加禁止，可是多年習俗相沿，並難於改革，所以防護人員常有「把白帕予去掉」的呼喝！</p>
<p>與白帕予相映成趣的還有一種「烘籠」，正如下江的「火缽」，是烤手烤脚取暖用的。用火每每頭上紮着「白帕子」，手裏拿個「烘籠」，另隻手取根「竹節」製的菸斗，迪吸菸葉，別有一番閒散風味！</p>
<p>（二）語言異趣</p>
<p>四川的言語，頗有文縐縐的，常有言談中出口成章的！但亦有以駡人語為口頭禪者！比如「個（語助詞）龜兒」「狗（語助詞）老子」，此外語法組織特殊的像「硬是」「要得」「要不得」「　得」字常讀為「Dai」音！「什麼」說為「嗓子」，「　子。</p>
<p>更有幾個字和下江字的用意根本不同：比如「把門閂起」，不能如是讀，一定要改說「把門插倒」！反而「把人捆綁起來」要改說為「把他拴（讀如閂）起」！所以四川的犯人統是用繩子把兩臂兩手反綁起來的，那就是「拴」的意思。</p>
<p>我們初到成都，楊村彬兄有一次在演「後防」開幕前，他向從新都縣來助演的農民要一個「木榔頭」，便說：「把那個槌子拿給我！」有的人在那裏大笑，我問他們：「笑什麼？」他們說：「槌子」在四川就是男生殖器的意思！我才恍然，吿諸村彬，相視大笑。</p>
<p>（三）山水之間</p>
<p>四川四面均屬山地，所以多「山城」；山城特點多「坡」，多「坎」「上坡」「下坎」，往往一個山城，分「上城」「中城」「下城」屋上有屋，人上有人，而且往往平房沿街，地下依坎，還有一兩層地下窒也不一定！那麼看去在那所街面的平房，事實上是第三層樓屋呢！坡坎旣多，行路上下，兩腿頗以為苦，往往用轎子代步，川中轎子大多前竿短而後竿長，下坡時不怕陡，不致使坐轎人跌傾，上坡時後面抬轎的抵着長竿子使前面抬轎子的被抵前行，坐轎者常能仰臥，兩足朝天！比轎子簡便而又有彈性的是滑竿（又有人寫着筏竿）坐位是用竹片子一排一排紥起來的，可以兜住坐的人的屁股，人可以水平仰臥，兩足蹬在另一竹片上，長途旅行者往往加上被蓋，舖墊而臥，可是有時四川死人，無力買棺材埋葬者，也用竹蓆裹起置滑竿上抬去，挖坑埋掉了事！入川後，抵萬縣，上碼頭便是二百幾十層的石坡，足够爬上一起！初來之外省人頗不習慣！普通住重慶的人們，沒有一天出外不爬坡走坎的！有心臟病的人對倒此是一件「大忌」的苦事！</p>
<p>我曾獨遊峨嵋山，全是陡坡，每級一百層，每層石面只有五六寸寬，有時上有靑苔，偶不睬穩，每易跌落山　，令人心悸！所以那些坡有名為「觀心坡」「鑽天坡」等，聽了名字便令人頭疼！</p>
<p>高山必有大水。川中水流湍急，飛瀑橫行，山洪偶發，動輒泛濫，靠水處有「灘」，有「沱」，有「碚」，「灘」多為砂石雜立江心，水淺時畢露，所以又名「淺灘」，淺灘最難過，水流險惡，「過灘」為船家以生命與自然搏鬥最激烈的一瞬，拉灘有縴工，揹縴者恒一聯串，我住嘉陵江畔凡四年，春夏秋冬四季，常於夜半聽呼救聲！大水天，浮屍的過境，覆舟的遣漿飄浮，慘呌與呼號，聽了令人常常發抖，這種自然的威襲常使人們生命加上一重暗影！</p>
<p>我家住在「張家沱」，朋友們也曾住過「唐家沱」，「李家　」！這「沱」字也是「川朱一，牠代表傍水的半島村莊。是在四川才發見的新字。同樣地，我家住北碚，「碚」字意思大概是橫互江心的石灘之類，「北碚」就以朝陽鎭與對岸東陽鎭黃桶鎭之間的橫阻嘉陵江流的「碚」石而得名。這「碚」字也彷彿他處少見。</p>
<p>（四）怪味口！</p>
<p>入虁門，品川味，從吃上，看見到處酒的「海椒」「辣油」，便略窺川人脾胃的偏愛！有人說，四川霧大，濕氣重，人們多吃辣味可解瘴氣，足以養身保健，這話也算言之有理。在重慶，我們吃慣「白玫瑰」的豆瓣醬辣子燒鯽魚，還有粉蒸肉，不放酒，不放葱和蒜，只要拌上辣子便可解去一切腥氣味！「火鍋毛肚」的火鍋，像是北平的涮羊肉鍋子，他的基本原湯內放了「酸」「辣」「麻」三大味，酸者醋也，辣者海椒，麻者花椒是也，所以吃毛肚火鍋的人，無不辣得滿頭大汗。此外成都的「吳炒手」，與「姑姑宴」，那更是出名講究調味的吃食處。在叙府，我吃過「棒棒鷄」，這又名「怪味鷄」。事實上便是鷄腿，鷄肉，加以辣椒，糖、，鹽，醬，芝蔴糊，葱等作料和食而巳！</p>
<p>「炒手」便是「餛飩」！講究的，在用眞鷄湯，油的，湯少，作料好，味鮮，有人說還要加耗子肉。</p>
<p>成　　四川最講究「小吃」的地方，有所謂「不醉無歸小酒家」之類舖名者，到處林立，價廉物美！四川米飯論碗賣，一碗名日一個「貓耳（帽兒？）頭」（也許是諧音）不知此名何由而起！</p>
<p>「泡菜」「榨菜」是四川的特有產物，製法其實很為簡單，味道却是鮮美。</p>
<p>素菜中有一種「磨芋」，最初我當他是假的「饅魚」，後來才知道是一稱膠質體，由一種植物中取出的漿液加熟水冲成的！據說富有養料。</p>
<p>「魚香肉絲」「回鍋肉」「爆醃肉」是我最最喜歡吃的川菜！川人嗜酒，勸酒方法多，有所謂「編酒」之術，我們在川裏居住過的人，常與當地「紳糧」往還酬酢，無不逼而「開戒」，更逃不了「醉」的笑話。川中能飲之人，有外號「醉七天」「醉不醒」「帶不醒」「酒　子」的，可見海量之「海」！</p>
<p>銀耳，夏蟲冬草之類的川中特有補品，在我不感興趣，故爾與我無緣！</p>
<h3>春禽</h3>
<p>— 張書旂</p>
<h3>孤寂</h3>
<p>— 斯秀</p>
<p>夜深沉了。</p>
<p>案頭上，油盞的燈芯吐露着一朶黯紅的火花；微弱的光輝照映在那灰暗的泥牆上無比的陰鬱，微微的搖曳和擺動着的燈焰好似疲憊底陰影在奸險地微笑。冬底天——濃厚的鉛灰敷着的天——又又展現在眼前。</p>
<p>我從遼遠的夢裏歸來，那縷縷的情絲編織成的夢幻；躺在狹窄和冷硬的床上，輾轉着，再也不能入睡。靜靜地，我傾聽着：那頹廢的古城深夜的呻吟，那嚴寒的風放肆的怒號，那讓黑夜底陰暗淹沒的星星無聲的歎息，和幽怨，……</p>
<p>颯颯的寒風，彷彿是有禮的來客，頻頻地叩打着破舊的窗檻；沉重而平靜的心田，掀起了一層漣漪，感情的浪德在洶湧。</p>
<p>默默地，讓失眠的情緒侵佔着。</p>
<p>忽然的覺得：似乎窗外是一片無垠的，湛藍又明朗的天空；遼闊的邊際，襯點也似的飄忽着幾絲輕淡的行雲；……</p>
<p>一股率眞底力量在牽引，一個誘人的素樸又美麗的笑靨在召喚。</p>
<p>於是，披起單薄的衣衫，輕輕地推開了房門，走向夜底深處。</p>
<p>衖堂裏迷濛着夜的黑暗，一長串的歲月來，讓戰爭的烟火訓練成的夜眼，分辨着令落地散佈在地上的水蕩。開始還感覺困難，有些兒躊躇；隨後倒也慣常了</p>
<p>經過一段遙遠的路途，驀然的傳來了一連串輕輕的歡笑，那笑聲裏漾溢着眞情的快樂和溫暖，那掛着微笑的臉兒是受人多麼的羨慕和祝福。</p>
<p>一股熱情的激流，滾動在深夜靜寂的大地上，向着人們心靈的深處。</p>
<p>漸漸地感到溫度，彷彿那一股熱情的激流湧進心田，充實了我那生命的脈流。可是，並不久就感覺得這些祗不過是天際飄忽的行雲，在我的靈魂……</p>
<p>枯涸的心田依舊沒有潤滑了銹住的心扉，我的心扉終久是急閉着。</p>
<p>無可抑制地，我舉起了頭。湛藍的天空被夜神塗抹了陰暗，沒有一顆星星是露出臉龐在天空閃爍着微渺的光亮。這灰黯和冷寂的天空，就好似我深藏着的心版。</p>
<p>一陣寒風孤寂地迤邂過黑夜的原野。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血206</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>我們正要聽聽鶴見怎樣答覆萍子，却無話聲傳來，倒是清清楚楚，聽出了擦自來火聲，想必鶴見正在「加油」；一會兒傳聲器裏發出槖槖槖的聲音韻律均勻，我可以想見，必是鶴見負起手來，在屋子裏往來蹀　。這是他在問題嚴重時候，運用思想的習慣。我們靜靜地候了好一會，才聽見步聲驟然停止：</p>
<p>「好，」鶴見的聲音，「準定動身……可是我得先去吿別朋友一聲……你同意嗎？……」</p>
<p>「那是當然的……可是我也有一個要求……」萍子似乎在笑着</p>
<p>「什麼呢？」</p>
<p>「未動身前，我想请求大哥介紹我，見見您幾位貴友；岳君，還有那一位小，……她貴姓？她長得眞美！我感覺慚愧。還有一位，是她的令弟？那麼可怕的一雙眼睛，像有金光射出來似的。…」</p>
<p>「介紹的話，我很贊成。尤其是這裏的一位總隊長……可是我得先去徵求他們幾位的同意……同意的話，我想用三十分鐘，我們舉行一個小宴會。這是要報答這裏總隊長的款待……」</p>
<p>「那更好了…不曉得他們願意看見我這麼一個怪物嗎？」</p>
<p>「我先打一個電話試試看。」鶴見這麼說着。</p>
<p>照先前一樣，w君一聽鶴見要打電話，立刻把「傳聲器」停手，順手也把那隻抽屜關上。</p>
<p>在電話裘，w君的會鶴見在十分鐘以後會面。我知道w君的用意；因為這裏還有一點手績，必須佈置一下。第一重要的佈置，我們必須散開一下，改換我們收聽了這個實大消息之後，一種緊張的情緒。这是心理上重要佈置。此外，w君也得徵求我們的同意，誰願見萍子，誰不願見萍子，然後由w君佈置。再有一點，w君必得要我們在這幾分鐘內，把大家關於聽了這個「八的秘密」的秘密，討論一下；由誰吿訴鶴見，或暫時不給他說明。但必須有個一致態度，省得呌他受刺戟。同時還想乘此請示戴先生，對於這個情報，我們應取何種動作。</p>
<p>果然，w君放下電話，即將我所猜想的幾點，一一向我同耀羣說明。我們這假小組會議，只有四五分鐘，已吿完畢。最重要的議決案，乃由我個人，先事向鶴見說明收聽他同萍子談話的事。這是一個準備動作；因戴先生希望明瞭萍子的工作步驟，並願意彼此盡力相互策應，破壞這個「八」的計劃。</p>
<p>這小組討論剛學，我忽地覺察耀羣的態度，有些異樣。</p>
<p>「隊長，假使您允許的話，我也得走了！」耀羣沉吟了一下，這　向w君說着。</p>
<p>「嶼」，w君怔了一怔。這，大槪也是有些察覺耀羣的熊度，突然改變，一時抓不住她這突變的動機。</p>
<p>耀羣看見w君怔住，立時也覺得自己的態度，轉變得太快，似乎落了兒女常套，有些欠大方似的，便趕緊聲明：</p>
<p>「還是那個上山西的計劃……我預料古先生他們南下的工作，未必能够圓滿成功，這仗還得打下去……國軍一大部分，預備西去，所以我想請示你，照原定計劃，派我上山西去，……也好幹點什麼」。</p>
<p>這時我看見耀羣意氣十分激昂；看了她的神色，聽了她這幾句話，知道她的潛伏意識上，起了一種莫明其妙的錯覺，恐怕連她本人還不知道。筒單一句話；她，一個女子的好勝心理，已經把她整個的理智控制下了。</p>
<p>「哦！w君當下也明暸了一切；「行,很好，準定照原來的計劃辦，現在就請你着手準備罷。」</p>
<p>最後，我看見戴先生也在那裏點頭，表示贊成。（第七意完）</p>

<h3>藝文壇</h3>
<p>現居台灣的文化人，有許壽裳，李何林，黎烈文，臺靜農，李霽野，歐坦生等，大抵在省立編譯館，報館及台灣大學工作。</p>

<h3>質「匡中」義賣</h3>
<p>— 讀報人</p>
<p>「匡廬」二字，似乎與我頗熟悉。憶抗戰前，余會一度受訓廬山，抗戰中，武漢失陷，曾一度避居廬陵，因此「匡廬」二字誠為我腦海中不可磨滅之二字；每於閱報　書，抑或寫文批卷，逢「匡廬」二字，必多注意。</p>
<p>今晨護申報，見敎育新聞欄中，載有本市「匡廬」中學為與建校舍舉行義賣，正午走訪友人，又見有匡廬中學三十週年紀念籌募敎育基金舉行抽籤義賣之請柬，詳讀該請柬中之鴻名，皆為當代社會賢達敎育長官，令人益加興奮；因「匡廬」與我有緣，今有「匡廬」中學籌募敎育基金，何不一助「匡廬」義舉，遂懷匡中請柬，匆匆歸來商於山妻，擬將山妻議有之飾物一件，質之以助匡中義舉，山妻初亦欣然慨允，旣而詳細玩味，似乎令人可惑，後視匡中請柬，見載明為卅週年紀念，此可證該校創立有卅載之歷史矣。然愚夫婦寓滬二十年，投身滬市敎育界垂十餘年，似從未聞本市有此一所垂數十年之匡廬中學，余恐健忘，再詢諸友人，皆不知此校創辦於何年何月；再查市敎育局之敎育週到中，所載之公私立中學一覽，一無所得，此疑竇之一也。再檢視「匡中」籌募敎育基金委員會請東中之最末署名者為王冠某，憶前决新聞報本地新聞欄內，似乎刋有自稱為國大代表之王冠某偽造圖章文件，冒某廠名領得工商貸款鉅金，因科犯時間恰合大赦條例，　院不予受理，此疑竇之二也。憶「匡廬」之校名戰前南市江西會館中有一「匡廬小學」致與「匡廬」似有淵緣；本市長樂路有「江西中學」，戰前有江西高職中學，（按江西高職中學，抗戰期內有校舍於南市車站路，被日寇拆毀，損失頗鉅）此疑竇之三也。</p>
<p>今署名匡廬中學三十週年紀念籌募敎育基金委員會廣發請柬，每柬附義賣券一紙，載明每劵國幣四十萬元，憑券常塲抽籤，視此券龐大之數字，當可想像此次得款額之鉅，惟恐為歹徒矇蔽地方長宮及社會賢達，而藉此歛錢，以讀報人身份，有下問數徐，、</p>
<p>（一）匡廬中學校董為誰？校長為誰？何年核准立案？</p>
<p>（二）匡廬中學戰前校舍建於本市何處？現在設立何處？班級多少？學生幾許？</p>
<p>（三）匡廬中學原設立人為誰？公立抑立？</p>

<p>北平小學生王鳳喜慘遭槍殺，經過幾天的交涉，賠得美金八百三十三元三角三分強（合法幣一千萬元），除去喪葬費用外，所餘想必無幾。中國人不值錢，不禁感慨萬千！</p>

<h3>「物價病」</h3>
<p>— 報童</p>
<p>第一次大戰發現了「彈震病」，此時此地，却發現了「物價病」了。</p>
<p>大概生活終究還是第一義的，因此，物價的高低會强烈的刺激着每個人的神經。本來物便的增漲，壓縮着每個人的生活，增漲一倍，就壓縮人們的生活一半。如今，這一現象正在加深擴大，物價的漲勢並不因生活指數的凍結而停止，眞如五千一萬的大票並不因立法委員的呼籲而不再發行一樣。</p>
<p>在轟炸，在物價，在戰事中，每一個人都或多或少的患起心臟病，要末，由于太多的刺激，誰都神經衰弱起來了，這是在戰時。至于現在，也並不距離太遠，物價，還是一個份量極重的名詞，宛如一塊壓在人們心頭的日見沉重的鉛石。</p>
<p>這是一個「物價病」的例子：前幾天某報消息，據石家莊來人談，該地某君一日購物，詢問貨價後，突一驚成疾。並悉此人在戰時後方曾因物價高漲而神經失常云。</p>
<p>因物價增漲而致神經失常，因物價昂貴而致一驚成疾，這終究是大時代中小人物的悲劇吧。這也是我們小人物共同的經騐，當早晚市價不同而發展成一日數變之時，當物根的票籤連改動也不及索性一起撤掉之時，誰都會驚悸起來，覺得錢袋中的一束一束錢幣在一分鐘一分鐘的减少了它的重量，它的價値了。</p>
<p>生活，這個字是絕端嚴肅的，物價高了，生活困難了，那對人們是一個嚴重的打擊，經得起打擊的，苦悶的活下來，經不起打擊的，自然要病倒下來了。</p>
<p>因此，有人會一詢物價之後，驚悸成疾，也因此有人在物價筒漲中，竟致神經失常。</p>
<p>這個物價病，是無藥可治的吧，如果有，那也得請教我們的政治　生了。</p>

<p>在煤油燈的黯淡的燈光下，蘭看見諸協理故意地把金愛麗拉往較遠的一隅去，她擔心那個可憐的少女又要跨進另一個陷坑了。可是她現在沒有心思再管別人的事，很快地她就移過目光來，望着黑黝黝的洞口，一面用手輕拍着榮兒的肩膀，要他安靜下去。</p>
<p>洞外傳來了悶雷似的炸彈的爆炸聲，夾着緊密的機關槍聲。</p>
<p>「這會子可糟了，」徐紹明急得直拍大腿，聲音提高到像跟人相罵的程度。「我所有的傢俱全裝在柏家包的幾輛篷車上，今天下午還沒有掛出，這會要是炸的火車站，保管一起完蛋！」</p>

<p>她的聲書裏有一些哽咽，但並不會哭，倒是小榮受到一種不祥的意識的預示，已貼在她懷裏，拉開嗓子哭起來了（二七）</p>

<h3>Two Bills on US Treasury Bills and Public Bonds Passed: Minister of Finance Yu Attends and Provides Detailed Explanation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] The 320th meeting of the Fourth Session of the Legislative Yuan was held at the Legislative Yuan hall at 9:20 AM on the 27th. Present were 105 members including Liu Keshu, Chen Guyuan, Lou Tongsun, Lin Bin, and Di Ying. President Sun chaired the meeting. After reporting items, the chairman declared a change in the agenda to first discuss the report from the Finance Committee in conjunction with the Economic Committee, reviewing the two draft bills of the Short-Term Treasury Bill Ordinance of the 36th Year and the US Dollar Public Bond Ordinance of the 36th Year. Minister Yu Hongjun was invited to attend and provide explanations, and answer numerous questions from the members. After about an hour, he left the meeting. The bill was then passed with amendments.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The government's issuance of 400 million US dollar bonds has completed the legislative process at the 320th regular meeting of the Fourth Session of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 27th, and sales will begin on April 1st. Finance Minister Yu Hongjun attended the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 27th and, when reporting on the issuance process, explained that the main purpose of this measure was to absorb floating capital, stabilize finance, and achieve a balanced budget. He also pointed out that the interest rate on the issued bonds was quite generous, and the public would surely compete to purchase them enthusiastically. He solemnly declared that this measure was the most important step for the government to establish credibility with the people, benefiting both the country and the people. He guaranteed that the to-be-organized Fund Management Committee would be open and sound. The following is a summary of Yu's report: After the announcement of the economic emergency measures plan, the authorities paid close attention to rectifying tax collection and handling enemy and puppet assets in order to reduce issuance and stabilize finance, thereby balancing the budget. However, the above two tasks could not be effective immediately, and there was an extreme abundance of floating capital in Shanghai, with funds concentrated. Banks were seeking outlets one after another, rushing towards securities and consuls. Without effective measures, it would be difficult to avoid trouble. The authorities felt that in order to achieve a balanced budget, in addition to relying on tax increases and other measures, the issuance of public bonds should be considered. When the Ministry of Finance considered this issue, it paid attention to the following points: First, people are generally profit-seeking. If the interest rate on public bonds is not high, it is not easy to arouse people's interest. Therefore, the treasury bill interest rate was set at two percent, which can be said to be quite generous. Changes in laws and regulations often lead to a loss of credibility with the people. Therefore, when issuing public bonds, it is necessary to provide the public with guarantees. This time, the issuance of bonds includes the organization of a fund management committee, in which local figures and legal entities can participate in addition to the government. In addition, all funds are guaranteed by enemy and puppet assets and state-owned enterprises, and are handed over to the committee in advance. In this way, the people can feel that there is a guarantee. In terms of interest, the interest rate on short-term treasury bills is two percent, which is unprecedented. At that time, some people thought that it would be difficult to maintain in the future. When the Ministry of Finance considered it, it believed that one percent or one and a half percent was not uncommon in the Shanghai market, and two percent annual interest was not too high. From the government's point of view, it was already very high, but if 4.6 trillion legal tender can be quickly absorbed in a short period of time, the interest point does not need to be considered. Talking about the repayment of principal and interest, the principal will be repaid in the future based on the exchange rate quoted by the Central Bank on that day, which is in line with the conditions for principal protection. Therefore, although the interest rate is lower than the market rate, the people also feel it is beneficial. The interest rate on US dollar bonds is set at six percent because US dollar bonds are long-term deposits, and US dollars and other foreign currency deposits or cash and gold are used to purchase them. Deposits held abroad have a six percent interest rate, which is already very high. The government's handling of deposits held abroad has already drafted the Jia Bao Ordinance, which will be sent to the Legislative Yuan. The authorities will ensure that these funds find a way out and are fully utilized. In addition, freezing gold notes is not a solution. The authorities intend to absorb them. In order to show great credibility, the government stipulates in Article 6 that the National Government will issue an order stating that US dollar bonds will definitely be repaid in US dollars in the future to show credibility to the people.</p>
<h3>Purchasing Public Bonds with Gold: 50 US Dollars per Ounce</h3>
<p>Another key point is the gold exchange rate, which will be stipulated by the Ministry of Finance in a separate order. If public bonds are purchased with gold, the exchange rate will be calculated at 50 US dollars per ounce, in other words, it will increase from 480,000 to 600,000, an increase of 20 percent, which is also one of the absorption methods. Yu concluded: This measure was repeatedly discussed with the Shanghai banking community in advance. The government eagerly hopes to use this opportunity to show great credibility to the world, to start afresh, and to make the people deeply feel that these bonds are truly guaranteed. This matter is beneficial to the country and beneficial to the people. It is hoped that after the issuance, at least a portion of floating capital can be absorbed to meet current needs. In response to questions, Yu said: The government had considered changing the repayment period for short-term treasury bills from three years to two years. However, such a change would result in too rapid repayment, and the floating capital would be released soon after it was absorbed, creating too much pressure, which would negate the original intention. Therefore, it was set at three years. Some legislators suggested that one hundred million US dollars of short-term treasury bills be issued on a trial basis first. Yu repeatedly disagreed, believing that if only one hundred million US dollars were issued, it would not be of much help to the current financial situation, and hoped that the people would have firm confidence, and believed that all current measures that reduce issuance and contract currency should be taken. Technically, it can be discussed, but the number cannot be changed. If these symptomatic measures are combined with fundamental solutions, it will not be difficult to stabilize prices and finance, and it will not be difficult to overcome the difficulties. The economy may also see a turning point. It is hoped that courage can be mustered. Yu finally solemnly stated that the issuance of bonds this time is entirely free subscription, and there is no intention of apportionment. At the same time, in his capacity as Minister of Finance, he guaranteed that the organization of the Fund Management Committee will be open and sound, and the entire meeting responded with warm applause.</p>
<h3>Lou Tongsun Receives Our Newspaper Reporter, Discusses the Significance of Issuing Bonds, Guiding Floating Capital into the Broad Path of Construction</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Economic authority Lou Tongsun, when receiving our newspaper reporter on the 27th, spoke about his feelings on the government's issuance of 400 million US dollar bonds, saying: From the perspective of channeling floating capital, stabilizing the currency value, and gradually stabilizing prices, so as to seek to restore economic normalcy, I think no one would disagree in principle with the issuance of 400 million US dollar bonds this time. Since the implementation of the emergency plan, private gold notes, especially gold, have mostly been frozen and immobile. If such a large portion of wealth is left unused for a long time without finding ways to guide and use it, it would be a great loss to the entire national economy. The meaning and purpose of issuing 100 million US dollar public bonds should be to avoid this loss and to give gold notes a way out. The harm of floating capital has long been criticized and painfully felt by the people of the country. At the same time, this floating capital is like a strange monster that is invisible, inaudible, traceless, and erratic. It is really "easier said than done" to completely defeat and thoroughly eliminate it in our country's social organization and the current financial and fiscal system. However, this monster must be stopped from its activities or its activities must be improved, otherwise it will be difficult for our general economic situation to return to normal. Issuing public bonds is a legitimate means of national finance (national finance is nothing more than taxation, raising funds, and issuing currency). The government should have implemented it many years ago. However, the responsible authorities in the past did not do this, and instead used various trading methods "especially selling gold" to compete with the people in the market for profit, which was a mistake in seeking fiscal compensation. We must not repeat this mistake and should quickly return to the proper fiscal path. On the one hand, it opens up a way out for floating capital, attracting it and allowing it to enter normal financial savings institutions in the first step, and then cooperate with the government's guidance and management. In the second step, it is transferred to the broad path of production and construction. On the other hand, it can make legal tender return to the market, avoiding the continued expansion of currency. Stabilizing the currency value is also stabilizing prices, so that the state's financial revenue and expenditure, whether in deficit or not, or the amount of the deficit, can be obtained with a more true and certain number, and then we can talk about a fundamental solution to the overall economy. "For example, currency reform, tax system adjustment, etc.," so that the country can move towards the new economy and new construction, to build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. The issuance of 300 million US dollar short-term treasury bills this time, converted to 3.6 trillion legal tender, is a number that cannot be considered too large, but if it can be promoted to the fullest extent, re-establish national credibility, and then be properly coordinated in other aspects, it can be said to have great significance and it is not difficult to achieve the expected results. Based on the above views, I believe that this bond issuance is a method that is suitable for the times and should gain the trust and support of the financial community and the people of the whole country. Economic crises are often more profound and severe than political or military crises. In order to save the crisis before the play, before there are other better evaluation methods, it is indeed impossible not to trust the government and support this relatively most legitimate and reasonable financial method. But in the end, there are still two points that must be brought to the special attention of the government. First, the supervisory committee established in the regulations must be organized in a sound manner and must be absolutely open. Second, at the very least, our government must say that within the terms of these two public bonds (treasury bills for three years and public bonds for ten years), within ten years, our government must always faithfully implement every word of every sentence stipulated in the regulations for these two types of public bonds. No matter what unexpected circumstances or changes occur, there must not be any measures that affect credibility in the slightest. This is very important. If the above two points cannot be fully achieved, then the national credit will never be restored, and we will inevitably fall into a tragic situation of complete bankruptcy. This responsibility is too great, and I sincerely hope that the responsible authorities will give it careful and serious consideration at the beginning of the implementation of these two public bonds passed by the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<h3>The Total Amount of Floating Capital in the Shanghai Black Market Reaches 2 Trillion: Jian Guansan Advocates Raising the Standard of Living for the Middle and Lower Classes</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Legislator Jian Guansan said: The issuance of US treasury bills is roughly in line with my previous advocacy of stopping gold trading, nationalizing foreign currencies, and purchasing foreign deposits with public bonds, but there are conditions that require special attention in terms of economics and implementation methods. (1) US dollar bonds are more profitable than treasury bills. When promoting sales in the future, the country should be divided into several major regions to organize sales committees. (2) When repaying the principal in the future, if it is used to purchase machinery and raw materials from abroad for industrial construction, the government should provide special convenience to show encouragement. (3) These two public grievances are sufficient. Treasury bills alone cannot save the financial and economic crisis. Expenses should be reduced as much as possible, preparations should be made to rectify the currency, control the concentration of wealth, eliminate bureaucratic capital, raise the standard of living of the middle and lower classes, and promote industrial construction, so that there may be a change in the overall situation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Social and economic scholar Jian Guansan said: The issuance of US dollar public bonds and treasury bills this time is, from a financial point of view, intended to subsidize the deficit budget and reduce the number of national claims issued and the rate of circulation. From an economic point of view, since January 17th of this year, few holders of gold and foreign currency have exchanged them for national currency at the Central Bank. A large amount of gold and foreign currency is neither exchanged for national currency nor can it be used as currency for transactions, so it becomes dead goods or dead capital. This time, the issuance of US dollar public bonds stipulates that they must be purchased with gold or foreign currency, in the hope of turning this type of dead capital into semi-circulating capital, directly making the economic situation more flexible, and indirectly slightly reducing the threat of black market interest rates. As for the issuance of short-term treasury bills, it is aimed at absorbing floating capital. It is said that there is about 2 trillion yuan of black market floating capital in Shanghai alone. If this large amount of black market floating capital causes trouble, it will be like bandits scurrying around in all directions, and the harm will be severe. The issuance of 300 million US dollar treasury bills this time is to absorb a large amount of floating capital in order to reduce its rampant momentum.</p>
<h3>Minister Bai Broadcasts a Report on the Truth of the Taiwan Incident: The Plan to Reorganize Taiwan Province Will Soon Be Promulgated</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 27th] Bai Chongxi gave a broadcast to compatriots across the country and overseas Chinese on the Taiwan Broadcasting Station at 8:00 PM today, reporting on the Taiwan incident. The full text is as follows: This unfortunate incident occurred in Taiwan. After many observations, I have learned the truth and now have a full understanding. This is because compatriots have been under Japanese rule for 51 years. The Japanese implemented narrow-minded and vicious education, distorting the Chinese government, people, and army, causing compatriots to despise the motherland and the people and army of the motherland, resulting in deep resentment. Therefore, the compatriots had a preconceived and deeply ingrained negative impression, which is the remote cause of the riot. After the restoration, the Chinese Communist Party maliciously propagated at home, slandering the Chinese Kuomintang government and the revolutionary army, and raised troops to create chaos, hoping to overthrow the government. A small number of Communist Party members and ambitious people in Taiwan also spread rumors and incited the public in Taiwan, using smuggling cases to stir up the riotous tidal wave of the February 28th Incident. We can see from the so-called 32 conditions and the orders, declarations, and slogans issued by rioters in various places that they not only demanded political reforms, but also used violence to besiege the Taiwan Provincial Government and the Garrison Headquarters, as well as the important fortresses of Keelung and Kaohsiung, and air force bases, military supplies warehouses, etc. Their attempt was to overthrow the government and seize power, and their actions were extremely narrow-minded and cruel. More than a thousand public education personnel and their families who came to Taiwan from the mainland to help build Taiwan and educate the children of Taiwan were killed and injured by rioters. This is a general outline of the riot, and it is indeed a distressing thing. I arrived in Taipei on March 17th and exchanged opinions with the local government and public opinion organs to inquire about the course of events. On the 20th, I set off to inspect the fortresses of Keelung and Kaohsiung that had been attacked by rioters, and passed through Pingtung, Fengshan, Tainan, Taichung, Changhua, Hsinchu, and Taoyuan counties and cities. These places were occupied by rioters during the incident and were in extreme chaos. Now order has been restored, and people have resumed their businesses and are working as usual. Order was restored in Taitung even earlier, which is very gratifying. Except for a small number of Communist Party members and rioters who are fleeing into the mountains out of fear of punishment, the vast majority of Taiwanese compatriots are able to understand the righteousness, support the motherland, and are not incited by the rebels. As for the central government's future policy of governing Taiwan, it is drafting a proper plan that meets the requirements of the Taiwanese people. Generally speaking, in the political aspect, it is planned to change the administrative chief executive office system to a provincial government system, but in order to meet actual needs, several additional offices will be added. Personnel in the various departments of the provincial government will give priority to qualified and outstanding local people. In the economic aspect, it is planned to actively rectify public enterprises and support private enterprises. In education, we should strengthen the national language and actively spread the traditional morality and culture of the motherland, while thoroughly eliminating the remaining poison, so that Taiwan and the motherland can be closely integrated and enhance the feelings of Taiwanese compatriots and compatriots across the country. These implementation plans will soon be promulgated.</p>
<p>Although Taiwan is separated from the motherland by only a strip of water, because it has been occupied for half a century, people in the mainland and overseas Chinese are deeply concerned that they may not be fully aware of the Taiwan incident, and it is inevitable that false information will be passed around, leading to a loss of truth. Therefore, I will make a fair and clear report on the truth of the Taiwan incident so that compatriots who care about Taiwan can rest assured.</p>
<p>Taiwan is an important national defense base in China. Most of the people of Taiwan came from various provinces in Fujian and Guangdong. They are related to compatriots in the country by blood and share common interests. I deeply hope that compatriots across the country will understand Taiwan more, help Taiwan more, and I also deeply hope that Taiwanese compatriots will uphold the spirit of the nation above all else, love the motherland, and love each other with compatriots across the country, and work together to build a new Taiwan based on the Three Principles of the People, and build a united, unified, and strong Republic of China.</p>
<h3>British Representative Refuses to Participate in the Exchange of Information on China</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Moscow, 26th] US Secretary of State Marshall recently proposed that the three powers exchange information on China. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov sent similar notes to Marshall and British Foreign Secretary Bevin, expressing agreement to exchange information on China by April 1 and to notify the Chinese government of the information. However, the British delegation today refused to participate in the exchange of information, saying that Britain has no representatives stationed in North China and therefore has no information to exchange. Britain's only reason for participating in discussions on China is that Britain participated in the 1945 Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference and endorsed the policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs at the meeting.</p>
<h3>Draft Law on the Election and Recall of National Assembly Representatives: Lively Discussion in the Legislative Yuan, Women Representatives Increased to 291</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] When the Legislative Yuan discussed the draft law on the election and recall of National Assembly representatives on the 27th, the issue of the number of women and professional representatives aroused fierce debate. "Everyone has their own reasons" (quoting legislator Zhong Tianxin), in a lively and tense atmosphere mixed with laughter, after face-to-face disputes, they shook hands and made peace. The whole day's meeting was not dull at all. In addition to Gu Zhenggang attending to explain, more than ten women's representatives including Luo Heng and Bao Deming attended to listen in, and President Sun's wife also attended to show support. The visitors' gallery was full. Representatives of professional groups, such as Wang Xiaolai, perched high next to the film projector, like a theater box. Whenever a legislator spoke in their favor, applause followed.</p>
<p>When discussing the number of representatives, the principle of "ladies first" was followed, and the number of women representatives was discussed first. Five female legislators, Zhao Maohua, Tan Tiwu, and Cai Yan, spoke one after another. Some requested that the number of women representatives should account for one-hundredth of the total, some advocated that it should be maintained at 20 percent, and others believed that 20 percent was only the starting point, not the end point. They also pointed out that women have made great contributions to the country and society, and it is absolutely impossible to limit them because the National Assembly Hall will be too small to accommodate them in the future. Male legislator Zhong Tianxin said that everyone has their own reasons. If it is to be considered reasonable, a solution should be sought in the constitution. The regional representatives to be elected in the future are not all male, and men and women have equal opportunities. In a humorous tone, he hoped that women representatives could account for more than 80 percent of the total in the future, "so that we men can be a little more idle." Jian Guansan pointed out that women also had a period of showing off their power in the past, that is, even though men currently have a slight advantage in society, there is no shortage of "henpecked" men in the family. We should not just settle old scores. Jian supported women representatives accounting for one-tenth of the total, but hoped that the representatives elected in the future should take into account various issues when meeting, and should not be limited to speaking for women. In the end, the total number of female representatives was increased to one-tenth, a total of 291, of which 71 were professional representatives. Following the discussion of the number of professional representatives, there was general opposition to this system, and some advocated reducing it from 450 to 250. However, because of the decision of the National Defense Council, it was inconvenient to change, and the decision was still made according to the original number. In addition, some legislators also raised opinions on the allocation of the number of representatives of overseas Chinese and national representatives with special living habits in the mainland, but they were all passed according to the original number. Today's discussion continued to Article 4, on the 28th</p>
<h3>Measures for Handling Deposits Held Abroad: Will Be Announced After Approval by the National Defense Council</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Measures for handling my deposits held abroad have been sent to the National Defense Council and may be announced soon. According to someone who drafted the measures: There was a clause in the measures that "deposits held abroad should be deposited in national banks in the original currency," but without interest. Now, seeing the provisions in the US Dollar Public Bond Ordinance that there are clauses for purchasing public bonds with foreign currency, then after deposits held abroad are unfreezed and declared, they can be transferred to purchase public bonds, because public bonds not only have interest, but also have very high interest. This point is enough to give deposits held abroad one more way out. It is also heard that the measures are expected to be passed by the National Defense Council recently. The deadline for declaration is only one month, and those who violate it will be sentenced to imprisonment for one to five years.</p>

The US dollar public bonds are divided into five denominations: 5,000, 1,000, 100, and 50. The interest rate is 6% per annum, payable every six months, with a principal repayment period of ten years. Regarding the collateral, the short-term treasury bonds are secured by designated units from state-owned production enterprises and enemy/puppet properties that are prepared for sale. The principal and interest payments of the US dollar public bonds will be backed by the government's designated US dollar reserves. Regarding the purpose, the short-term treasury bonds will be used to stabilize the financial situation, and the US dollar bonds will be used to replenish foreign exchange reserves and regulate foreign trade. Regarding the issuance method, they will be sold at the Central Bank's US dollar exchange rate, converted from national currency to US dollars, or purchased with US dollar deposits and other foreign currency deposits, or with gold. It was also decided that a fund management committee would be established for both the treasury bonds and public bonds to handle the supervision of the funds. After the legislative principles of the two proposals were submitted to the Legislative Yuan, the legislative procedures were completed at yesterday's legislative meeting, and the regulations for the treasury bonds and public bonds will be officially promulgated soon. This is a new measure taken by the government to overcome financial difficulties after the implementation of the "Economic Emergency Measures Plan."</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the "Economic Emergency Measures Plan," general observers have considered that the government's budget balance and the absorption of domestic floating capital and foreign exchange deposits abroad will likely follow the path of issuing bonds. During the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, it was originally planned to issue "Price Index Bonds." This method was theoretically sound, but there were many technical problems, so it was not approved. Therefore, the Supreme National Defense Council recently made the decision to issue the above two types of bonds. The news was well received by the financial community in Shanghai. It is generally believed that issuing bonds at this time is a good opportunity to withdraw legal tender, channel gold and foreign currency into the formal market, and the interest rate is very high, so people will be happy to buy them; however, what everyone is concerned about is the issue of the purpose of the bond. Originally, the national financial road lines are nothing more than taxes, public bonds and issuance of currency. Taxes are limited, and the people's strength is exhausted, and the road to taxes seems to be exhausted, so we cannot actively take the road of "increasing taxes" or "raising taxes". The issuance of currency has already created an extremely high peak, and this dangerous road can no longer be taken. The matters related to the issuance of currency in the "Economic Emergency Measures Plan" seem to have realized that this road can no longer be taken. Bonds are more reasonable and normal, with uses and guarantees, and legal protection, and are a good opportunity to absorb floating capital at present. Therefore, our view on the issuance of these two types of US dollar bonds is the same as that of the general public. It is believed that this measure can absorb floating capital and foreign exchange, and can absorb frozen gold.</p>
<p>The total amount of the two bonds is US$400 million. If one US dollar is equivalent to 12,000 yuan in legal tender, it will be a total of 4.8 trillion yuan in legal tender. This number is indeed very large, and it must be promoted and used carefully. Regarding promotion, a widespread promotion method must be adopted. Shanghai's floating capital mostly flows in from the interior, and it should be promoted to the people. However, when promoting to the people, it is first necessary to avoid the compulsory allocation by local officials, which will destroy the credit of the bonds. This must be noted! This is one point. When the government promulgated the "Economic Emergency Measures Plan," it clearly ordered that private foreign exchange held abroad should be declared to the government, and the government would purchase it at a fixed exchange rate on a regular basis. This measure is very wise and has won the support of public opinion. However, there are doubts about the progress of the handling. Therefore, the issuance of US dollar public bonds this time should be undertaken first by people who have foreign exchange deposits abroad, and even the use of diplomatic or political compulsion methods is not considered impatient. Moreover, this is beneficial to those who hold gold and foreigners, so why not do it? At the same time, it can also balance international payments for the country. This is the second point. Regarding the repayment of the two bonds upon maturity, the Legislative Yuan should pay attention to the liquidity of the bonds when deliberating on the regulations and must protect them. The regulations stipulate that payment should be made in US dollars and must be done so, regardless of how the foreign exchange rate will be in the future. Do not repeat the mistake of discounting past gold savings. Therefore, the regulations must prevent this and must establish administrative remedies in advance. This will restore the government's credibility. This is the third point. Regarding the use of the bonds, the news says that it is for "stabilizing the financial situation," which seems vague. In short, 4.8 trillion yuan in legal tender can be used for a lot of purposes when the government is shrinking the currency supply, and it must be paid in a normal way to win people's hearts. It is not possible to make up for this year's large budget deficit. The Supreme National Defense Council recently decided to reduce expenditures by 146.4 billion yuan and postpone payments of 85 billion yuan to the second half of the year in order to balance the budget. If it can be saved and if it is tight, there should be no need to make up for it or add to it, then the financial revenue and expenditure will be able to maintain a balance. Since the financial revenue and expenditure can be balanced, the bond income this time should undoubtedly be used for production and construction to actively promote national economic construction. The "Economic Reform Plan" passed by the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee has a broad vision and is a fundamental strategy. Therefore, it is more meaningful and valuable to reasonably pay the bond income to economic construction. If so, everyone will rise up to protect it, everyone will compete to buy it, and the important decisions of the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee will not fail!</p>
<h3>Prospects for Dutch-Indonesian Relations</h3>
<p>The Linggadjati Agreement draft agreed upon by the Netherlands and Indonesia on November 15 of last year was signed and established on the 25th. The main points of this agreement are as follows: (1) The Netherlands recognizes the Republic of Indonesia as the de facto political authority on the islands of Java, Madura, and Sumatra; (2) The Republic of Indonesia will join Borneo and the Greater East Archipelago to form the Federation of Indonesia; (3) The Federation of Indonesia and the Kingdom of the Netherlands will form a union, the United States of Indonesia, with the Queen of the Netherlands as the head of state. However, the joint union and the United States should be established on January 1, 1949; (4) The areas occupied by the Dutch army in Indonesia should be handed over to the Republic of Indonesia before January 1, 1949; (5) After the establishment of the United States of Indonesia, the Netherlands will introduce the Federation of Indonesia to join the United Nations. This draft agreement has undergone more than four months of deliberation by the Dutch and Indonesian parties, and it has only been signed now. This shows that the conclusion of this agreement is not easy and is indeed a valuable agreement. It will not only bring an end to the nearly two-year Dutch-Indonesian conflict but also open up a wonderful prospect for the future of Indonesian independence and the cooperation between the Netherlands and Indonesia. As Deputy Governor-General Van Mook said, "The period of disputes and negotiations has passed, and now is the time to develop friendship and cooperation." Whether for the benefit of both the Netherlands and Indonesia, or for the peace of the South Seas and the rights and interests of our compatriots, the signing of this agreement is worth praising. Foreign Minister Wang specially issued a statement on this matter, expressing his gratification that the Netherlands recognized Indonesian independence and hoping that the welfare and safety of our compatriots could be guaranteed from now on. This can be regarded as the common attitude of the people of our country towards the Dutch-Indonesian issue.</p>
<p>Since Japan's surrender, the people of Indonesia have raised the banner of national independence and liberation, demanding independence and autonomy. Although the Dutch authorities were aware of the trend of the post-war world and understood the revolutionary sentiments of the Indonesian people, they still felt somewhat reluctant to let go immediately, which made Indonesia, which had surrendered to the Japanese army, once again become a place of conflict and bloodshed between the Netherlands and Indonesia. Our country has expressed sympathy for the Indonesian movement for liberation from beginning to end and hopes that it will be successful. However, our country has three million compatriots in Indonesia, and as the saying goes, "When the city gate catches fire, the fish in the pond are affected." Their welfare and safety have been subjected to unprecedentedly serious threats, which naturally concerns us even more. During the 19 months of continued conflict, the loss of life and property of our compatriots in Indonesia is impossible to estimate, so we hope at all times that the Dutch-Indonesian conflict can be resolved peacefully on a reasonable basis. At the end of October last year, a ceasefire agreement was finally signed, which prevented large-scale conflicts from happening again, but the tense atmosphere of confrontation between the two sides still could not be eased. Fortunately, Deputy Governor-General Van Mook and Prime Minister Sjahrir are both politicians and diplomats with a broad vision, who can look at the big picture from afar, think about the big picture, and use their political wisdom to negotiate this draft agreement.</p>
<p>When this draft agreement was published, it caused a great uproar both in the Netherlands and in Indonesia. Especially in the Netherlands, everyone shouted slogans such as "the collapse of the empire" and "surrender to the Indonesian revolution." Not only did public opinion express dissatisfaction, but the opinions of the cabinet were also not consistent, almost causing a cabinet crisis. However, after Van Mook's efforts, coupled with the international situation's intolerance of continued Dutch-Indonesian conflict, it was finally passed by the Dutch Parliament. In Indonesia, this agreement was also unanimously considered to be too empty, and some places were ambiguous and could be interpreted differently. However, after Prime Minister Sjahrir issued a statement: "This treaty is only the first step in the struggle for independence," all parties were united under Sjahrir's leadership. Therefore, it is truly commendable that this draft agreement has been delayed until now to be signed and established!</p>
<p>There are many contradictions in the interpretation of this agreement by the Netherlands and Indonesia, and difficulties will inevitably arise during its implementation. However, we still hope that both the Netherlands and Indonesia can attach importance to international integrity and earnestly fulfill international treaties, and must not cause trouble again due to interests, so that the peaceful South Seas will once again fall into a state of turmoil. Therefore, we hope that the Netherlands and Indonesia can reconcile and repair relations from now on, not only to open up a new path for the friendship and cooperation between the two countries, but also to set a new example for the solution of the crisis. In addition to expressing our approval, the Chinese people urge our three million compatriots in Indonesia to work harder to promote the prosperity and strength of the emerging Republic of Indonesia and become the only stabilizing force to maintain peace in the South Seas.</p>
<h3>The Communist Army Obstructs the Repair of the Embankments on Both Sides of the Yellow River. Employees Repairing in Dongming Were Attacked.</h3>
<p>[Report from Kaifeng, this newspaper, 27th] The repair project of the embankments on both sides of the old course of the Yellow River below Huayuankou has been repeatedly obstructed by the Communist army, so the work is difficult to carry out. More than a thousand Communist troops are active near Dongming, and they have declared that they will not allow the embankment to be restored. If the embankment is restored, they will destroy it again. Employees responsible for the repair work northwest of Dongming were attacked and scattered by the Communist army on the evening of the 17th, and have not yet fully returned. In areas where the Communist army has not disrupted, the progress of the work is very good.</p>

<h3>Side Issues Arise During the Review of the German-Austrian Question. The Future of the Foreign Ministers' Conference is Bleak. Marshall Is Growing Impatient and Issues a Warning.</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 27th broadcast: It is reported that Marshall is deeply unhappy with the slow progress of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference on the German and Austrian peace treaties, especially since last night's meeting achieved nothing. On issues large and small, the four foreign ministers have divergent opinions, and the hope of reaching an agreement on the establishment of peace is almost a bubble.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 27th] The hope of reaching an agreement on a European peace treaty at this Moscow conference is gradually fading today. The four foreign ministers are deadlocked on issues large and small. The prospect of completing the Austrian Peace Treaty seems quite bright, but recently twists and turns have also occurred, and the Soviet Union has refused the US proposal to immediately resolve the definition of German assets in Austria. Yesterday's four foreign ministers' meeting lasted for nearly five hours, and no decisive agreement was reached on the German and Austrian peace treaties.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 26th] The four foreign ministers argued for a long time today on the issue of whether China should be a convening country for the German peace conference, but no agreement was reached. Marshall and Bevin strongly advocated that China be one of the convening countries for the peace conference, while Molotov firmly opposed it. A summary of the main points of the four foreign ministers' debate on this issue is as follows: Molotov mentioned the Potsdam Agreement and said that China was not a country that signed the German surrender instrument, so it should not be a convening country for the German peace conference. Bevin cited the discussion of this issue at the Paris Conference as an example, hoping that Molotov would no longer rehash the issue of whether or not to be a convening country in the discussion of the peace treaty of the preparatory countries, and should directly follow the example of the Paris Peace Treaty and make China a convening country for the German peace conference. Bidault said that at the beginning of the establishment of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, France was not one of its members, and France believed that once the preparatory work for the German peace treaty was completed, the four powers should abandon their special status and restore the five powers. Marshall proposed that since China is a member of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, it should be granted the same status as in Paris. Molotov continued, in Paris China was not a convening country for the peace conference, only a member of the Presidium of the General Assembly after the conference was convened, and he felt that it would not be harmful to use this method in the German peace conference.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 26th] The four foreign ministers have been unable to agree on the procedure for drafting the German peace treaty for many days. US Secretary of State Marshall, who had always been silent at the meeting, suddenly spoke sharply on the meeting today, "The side issues of the meeting have arisen, which is like binding oneself, which is meaningless in itself, but makes the chance of the meeting progressing smoothly even more slim." As a result, the four foreign ministers reached an agreement on the procedure for drafting the German peace treaty. The main points are as follows: (1) The four foreign ministers should continue to meet continuously; (2) During the meeting of the four foreign ministers, the advisory and information conference organized by the four powers and other major allies and the representatives of the countries concerned should also meet at the same time; (3) During the meeting of the political, territorial, economic, and financial standing committees, they should be guided by the four powers. The drafting of the German peace treaty according to this procedure will serve as the basis for convening the German peace conference, but opinions are still not consistent on the composition of various groups. At the same time, there are still three points that have not reached any resolutions, namely (1) the list of allied countries to be invited to participate in the future German peace conference; (2) whether China should be one of the inviting countries; (3) whether the German peace treaty should be signed by the German government. The only concrete result achieved at today's meeting of the four foreign ministers was the unanimous agreement to invite representatives from Yugoslavia and Italy to attend the meeting and present their opinions on the solution of the financial problems in the Trieste region.</p>
<h3>Austrian Peace Treaty in Stalemate. The Soviet Union Disposes of German Assets in the Austrian Occupation Zone. Molotov Says the United States Has No Right to Interfere.</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 27th broadcast: It is reported that Molotov has declared to Marshall that any disposal of German assets in the Soviet occupation zone of Austria by the Soviet Union is irrelevant to the United States. Marshall had made a proposal to try to break the deadlock on these assets, but Molotov has now firmly rejected it, so the hope of reaching an agreement on the Austrian peace treaty as soon as possible is very bleak.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 27th] It is reported that Molotov told Marshall that how the Soviet Union deals with German property in the Soviet occupation zone of Austria is not related to the United States. Molotov also cited the agreement between US Ambassador Harriman and Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky in 1945, in which Harriman's letter to Vyshinsky stated that "the Soviet government has the right to deal with 'German' property in Finland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and eastern Austria without consulting the British, French, and American representatives of the Allied Control Council. The British, French, and Americans may also deal with other German foreign property without consulting the Soviet Union. Vyshinsky agreed to Harriman's proposal in his reply. Although Molotov claimed that the free disposal of German property in Austria was based on the Potsdam Agreement, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Austria accused the Soviet Union of moving many non-German factories in Austria, which actually violated the secret agreement of Potsdam.</p>
<h3>Major Changes to US Ambassadors Abroad</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] According to reliable sources in Washington, the US diplomatic corps is now undergoing rectification, and there may be more than a dozen new appointments and transfers within the next week. It is said that the current ambassadors to the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Uruguay, Costa Rica, Iceland, and Yugoslavia are about to be vacant. The two new embassies that will be opened soon are the embassies in India and the rumored Romanian embassy.</p>
<h3>US Policy Toward Spain Unchanged</h3>
<p>[US Information Agency, Washington, 20th] A State Department spokesman declared: "The US government's current attitude towards the Spanish regime does not intend to change. The fact that the United States sent Karl Birpson to Madrid to serve as a first-class secretary and acting chargé d'affaires is purely an administrative adjustment and has no political significance."</p>
<h3>Lie Suddenly Leaves the US for Europe, Whether He Has a Mission Is Unknown</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 27th] Scandinavian Airlines said today that United Nations Secretary-General Lie has booked a seat on the company's transatlantic flight and left the US for Denmark and the Norwegian capital this morning. Whether this trip is just a visit to his home country of Norway or has another mission, it is difficult to obtain news from the United Nations at this time. Scandinavian Airlines also said that Lie also pre-purchased a return ticket for April 7. At the same time, in Lake Success this morning, Lie said at his first press conference since June that he deeply hoped that the United Kingdom would soon call for a special session of the United Nations to resolve the Palestine issue. According to Lie's announcement, when he receives this request, he will solicit the opinions of the various United Nations members on this proposal. If the majority of the members agree, he will convene a special session within 15 days. He also said that the special session would cost at least $500,000.</p>
<h3>Claims That Bevin Will Be Transferred to Another Position Are Denied by London</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 26th] Rumors that Foreign Minister Bevin may resign after the end of the Moscow Conference and be transferred to another department to preside over national production were immediately denied today by those close to Prime Minister Attlee. It is said that the Prime Minister "may eventually reorganize the cabinet in the near future, but it is almost impossible for Mr. Bevin to resign from the post of Foreign Minister. Bevin and Morrison have long been political enemies within the Labor Party, and Attlee would not dismiss the former and favor the latter, which would only increase the friction.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Does Not Participate in the First Meeting of the Trusteeship Council</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 26th] The Soviet Union refused to add to the first meeting of the United Nations Trusteeship Council today. According to the Charter, the Soviet Union, as a permanent member of the Security Council, is a member of the Trusteeship Council. This is the first time that a meeting of an important UN agency has been held without the participation of a Soviet representative since Soviet representative Gromyko dramatically withdrew from the Security Council meeting hall a year ago. Although the absence of the Soviet Union did not cause legal entanglements, it did cause concern among those responsible for the UN agency. These people were already anxious about the increasing tendency to avoid UN agencies on important issues. The confirmation of the Soviet Union's absence came 24 hours after Gromyko exercised his veto power to overturn the Security Council's majority vote supporting Britain's accusation of Albania laying mines. Secretary-General Lie also expressed his concern in his opening remarks today. Lie appealed to all member states of the United Nations to use this peaceful mechanism on all kinds of international issues, even if it is related to national survival. Lie did not directly mention President Truman's request for Congress to assist Greece and Turkey and his statement that the UN agency is currently unable to deal with the threat of totalitarianism to these countries.</p>
<p>[US Information Agency, Lake Success, 26th] The United Nations Trusteeship Council convened its first meeting today, and thus the last major agency in the United Nations Charter was declared established. The representatives elected US representative Sears as the first chairman, whose term of office has yet to be determined. New Zealand's Sir Berendsen was elected as the vice chairman.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Firmly Opposed Eight Draft Trusteeship Agreements</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 26th] When the United Nations Trusteeship Council convened its first meeting, there was no Soviet representative. The Soviet delegation to the United Nations did not explain this. However, the meeting of the Trusteeship Council continued as usual. Although the absence of the Soviet Union made people feel somewhat uneasy, it was not unexpected. At the last United Nations General Assembly, when the draft trusteeship agreements for eight trust territories were proposed, the Soviet Union had already expressed its firm opposition, and some of its proposed amendments were rejected at that time. Therefore, its boycott of the Trusteeship Council was expected. The reasons for the Soviet Union's opposition to the military case of the individual trusteeship agreement are as follows: (1) The agreement ignores the interests of "directly related countries." The Soviet Union believes that five should be directly related countries, and according to the Charter, the trusteeship agreement must be approved by all directly related countries; (2) The administration of some trust territories is considered to be part of the governance of the strong countries; (3) The agreement has not been approved by the Security Council, and it is planned to set up armaments in the former trust territories; (4) The trust territory refuses to set a deadline to amend the trusteeship agreement. The Soviet Union's absence does not affect the procedure of the Council's work, because technically the Soviet representative is still considered to be present.</p>
<h3>Truman Receives Reporters, Hoping That Congress Will Quickly Decide to Assist Greece and Turkey</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 26th] President Truman held a press conference today. A reporter asked: Is the policy adopted by the President preparing for war or preparing for peace? President Truman immediately replied: I hope that my statement on assisting Greece and Turkey on March 12 will be conducive to promoting world peace. My statement is very clear and can be understood without explanation. At this point, a reporter asked: The financial assistance given to Greece by the United Kingdom will cease on March 31. If the Congress discusses the issue of assisting Greece and Turkey and there is no result at that time, does the President think it is necessary to formulate a special bill? President Truman replied: I hope that Congress can quickly make a decision on the plan to assist Greece and Turkey. At this point, another trustee asked: Does the President advocate banning the Communist Party in the United States? President Truman immediately replied: Congress is currently discussing this issue, and I am not in a position to express my opinion here. Regarding domestic issues, I hope that domestic prices will not continue to rise. Some American businessmen have voluntarily reduced their prices, and I hope that labor unions will negotiate with employers because they demand higher wages and will not cause the cost of living to rise.</p>
<h3>Cabinet Meeting on Domestic Affairs</h3>
<p>Discussing How to Utilize US Aid</p>
<p>[United Press, Ankara, 27th] The Turkish cabinet is planning a partial mobilization of millions of people. Once the US Congress passes the Truman Plan, and Turkey receives US economic and technical assistance, it will immediately launch an effort to improve domestic railway and highway transportation, so that in the future, only a small national defense force will be needed, but a large force can be quickly mobilized for reinforcements when necessary.</p>
<h3>La Guardia's Views on the Greek-Turkish Issue</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] Former New York Mayor La Guardia, previously visited Greece and other Balkan countries in his capacity as UNRRA Director. Today, based on his experience, he presented his views on President Truman's aid to Greece and Turkey proposal to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stating: Assistance should be provided through UN agencies rather than by the United States alone. "The day we independently step into the Balkans will be a day of great misfortune for us. The situation in the Balkans cannot be rectified overnight, or even within ten years. It may take a generation." La Guardia advised the United States not to hastily "form a European bloc."</p>
<h3>US Speaker of the House to be Presidential Successor</h3>
<p>Senate Committee Resolves to Submit to Congress</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] The Republican-controlled Senate Rules Committee today passed a bill to make House Speaker Martin the first in line to succeed the President. The bill has now been submitted to Congress. According to the bill, the order of succession when the President is unable to serve would be: (1) Vice President, (2) Speaker of the House, (3) President Pro Tempore of the Senate, (4) Secretary of State, followed by other cabinet members.</p>
<h3>Mass Grave of 10,000 People Discovered in the Trieste Area</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Trieste, 26th] Another mass grave has been discovered in the lower Sha area of ​​San Lorenzo, Trieste province. It is reported that it contains more than two hundred bodies of German civilians and soldiers, all of whom were executed after being liberated in the Venezia Giulia region.</p>
<h3>Hoover Accuses US Communist Party of Attempting to Overthrow the Government; Promoting Americanism is Key to Preventing Communism</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] The House Un-American Activities Committee, currently reviewing a bill to outlaw the Communist Party, summoned FBI Director Hoover to testify today. Hoover described the US Communist Party as a "fifth column" whose goal is to overthrow the government. He stated that there is no doubt that the Communist Party's true allegiance is to the Soviet Union, not the United States. The Communist Party is a "fifth column" even more organized than the fifth columns of Nazis that were active in countries they attacked in the past. Hoover did not advocate taking any action that would give the Communist Party the opportunity to portray itself as a martyr. The best antidote to Communism is a powerful, rational, and old-fashioned Americanism. Earlier, Communist Party Secretary Dennis was refused the opportunity to testify for refusing to disclose his real name. One committee member repeatedly pressed him to reveal his real name. The man replied, "I have gray hair and am over forty years old." When asked again, he insisted, "I have never used another name, and it is irrelevant to the topic."</p>
<h3>US Unified Command of Army, Navy, and Air Force; New Defense Plan Completed; Admiral Nimitz Testifies Before Senate Military Committee</h3>

The purpose of this plan is to utilize the Army, Navy, and Air Force to keep war zones as far away as possible from the continental United States. These plans include: (1) joint defense between the United States and Canada, including standardization of weapons, etc.; (2) widespread establishment of Army, Navy, and Air Force bases; (3) special fortifications in Alaska and the Mariana Islands.</p>
<p>[United Press, Ottawa, 26th] The Canadian government announced today that it will cooperate with the United States in establishing several long-range radar stations in the "North" to promote joint defense plans and increase the safety of air and sea traffic.</p>
<h3>Korean Representatives May Participate in Peace Conference with Japan; Lieutenant General Hodge to Return to His Post This Weekend</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 27th] General MacArthur spoke with Kim Tong-son, president of the Korean Pacific News Agency, for half an hour today, informing him that Korea may have representatives attending the peace conference with Japan. MacArthur expressed considerable sympathy for the Korean people and had a clear understanding of the crux of the Korean issue, believing that after the US and the Soviet Union withdraw from Korea, the Korean people will be able to manage their own country.</p>
<h3>Discussion on Amending Election Law Leads to Brawl Among Japanese Legislators</h3>

No one can have more than one nationality at the same time. The second group's report was finally passed.</p>

<h3>Laying the Democratic Foundation of Local Politics: First Swearing-In of Elected District Heads; Speaker Pan Delivers Speech Hoping to Create a New Municipal Atmosphere; Mayor Wu Presides Over Oath Ceremony, Followed by Tea Reception</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The swearing-in ceremony for the elected heads and deputy heads of the city's thirty districts was held in the City Hall Auditorium yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Sixty people attended, including district heads and deputy district heads from various districts, such as She Weifan and Cheng Jingyuan. Mayor Wu, Commander Yi, Speaker Pan, City Government Secretary-General He, Land Administration Bureau Director Zhu, Health Bureau Director Zhang, and Civil Affairs Office Director Zhang all participated in the ceremony. After performing the ceremony as scheduled, Cheng Jingyuan, the head of Huangpu District, led the oath-taking, and the oath was: "I solemnly swear that I will respectfully follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will to implement the Three Principles of the People, abide by laws and regulations, respect the public opinion of the local people, and wholeheartedly strive for this war. I will never engage in corruption or accept bribes. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment. This is my oath."</p>
<p>After the oath, Mayor Wu, as the oath administrator, delivered a training message, stating three thoughts: (1) Shanghai is the largest city in our country, and under the leadership of Speaker Pan of the Municipal Council, it is moving towards a democratic path. This popular election of district heads will determine whether democratic politics can achieve its ideals, which depends entirely on how well the district heads perform their duties, so the responsibility is significant. (2) Cities in English-speaking countries do not have a district head system. This city has decided to implement this system for the first time. Whether it succeeds or fails, whether it is good or bad, depends entirely on the performance of the district heads. This not only affects the whole country but also affects the international community. Therefore, it is hoped that the district heads can assist the government to firmly establish this system in order to promote democratic politics. (3) The economy and social order are stable, political reform is needed, but for stability, the joint efforts of local governments, the council, and military police agencies are necessary. On the one hand, each district head is needed as a bridge between the government and the people, so that the government's intentions can reach the people, and the people's grievances can be reported to the government. Everyone should work together to overcome difficulties.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan then delivered a speech stating: Within two years of victory, this city has established a truly democratic foundation for local politics. But how effective it is and whether it is good or bad depends on how these first popularly elected district heads perform their duties. Just as schools have a school spirit and cities have a municipal atmosphere, this city used to be called a hotbed of crime due to the concessions. Now that the unequal treaties have been abolished, we want to reform our image under the leadership of Mayor Wu and work together to create a new municipal atmosphere. Since taking office, Mayor Wu has been able to get close to the people and visit and inspect rural areas to understand the hardships of the people. It is hoped that the district heads can also be close to the people and serve the people, doing what the people want and abhorring what the people hate, promoting benefits and eliminating abuses, so that a model of local autonomy can be established and democratic politics can be promoted.</p>
<p>Commander Xuan also delivered a speech stating: During the period of political tutelage, the Kuomintang exercised power on behalf of the people. Now that constitutional government has begun, the government is returning power to the people. Since the district heads are elected by the people, their responsibility is great to ensure that democratic politics looks like something at the beginning of its implementation. Today, Shanghai needs stability, but it is difficult to eliminate disturbances by bandits and traitors by relying solely on military police prevention and control. It is hoped that after the district heads take office, the power of self-government can be highly developed to assist the government in eliminating all adverse factors. Finally, Cheng Jingyuan delivered a response on behalf of the district heads, stating: "I feel a great sense of responsibility in being elected by the local elders in this complex environment. In the future, I hope that all officials will provide timely guidance." The ceremony ended at 4:00 PM. At 5:00 PM, Mayor Wu hosted a tea reception for the district heads at the Shaoju Road Police Club, and also invited Commander Xuan, Speaker Pan, and the heads of various bureaus and offices to accompany them. Opinions were exchanged at the meeting, which was very harmonious.</p>

<h3>Navy Department Sends Personnel to Investigate: Invites All Parties to Talk Today; Rescued Chief Engineer Goes to Nanjing to Report Details</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Regarding the issue of responsibility for the collision between the Fubo warship and the China Merchants Bureau's Haimin Wheel near Xiamen, which resulted in the sinking of the warship, the Shanghai Naval First Area Command has scheduled a preliminary investigative discussion today with the Shipping Administration Bureau, the China Merchants Bureau, and Captain Zai Rulin of the Haimin Wheel, as well as several passengers from the ship, at the Command, to discuss the welfare and family support issues for the more than 150 officers and soldiers who died in the sinking.

The Navy Headquarters also sent Liang Tongyi, the chief of the Maritime Affairs Section, to Shanghai the day before yesterday to investigate the case with Lu Shufen, a staff officer of the Shanghai Base Command.

<h3>China Textile Corporation Hosts Journalists: Tour of Three Factories - Mostly Fine Yarn Spinning Equipment - Close Connections Between Spinning, Weaving, and Dyeing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to provide outside information regarding the facilities of each factory under its jurisdiction, the China Textile Construction Corporation publicly hosted journalists from the city yesterday for a tour of the Second Textile Factory, the First Printing and Dyeing Factory, and the First Silk Spinning Factory. There were also five other factories included in the tour itinerary, but the tour did not reach those factories due to time constraints. At 9:30 AM yesterday, reporters from various newspapers gathered at the corporation's head office on Jiangxi Road. The tour began with a speech by the corporation's general manager, 束云章, who stated that the corporation's factories in Shanghai include 37 units across seven categories of cotton spinning, wool spinning, silk spinning, hemp spinning, knitting, and machinery. However, the corporation's factories are distributed throughout the country, and the organization is huge. Based on a rough estimate at current prices, the company's total assets should be over 3.5 trillion yuan. The cotton mills under the corporation spin cotton yarn with an average count of over 25.5, so most of the equipment is for spinning fine yarn. If we had to change to spinning coarser yarn, although it's not impossible, the machinery would have to be refitted, and a large part of it would have to be idled. As a result, production costs would increase and output would decrease, which would be a waste. The company's weaving equipment is mainly for weaving 12-pound fine cloth, and it would be equally difficult to switch to weaving 16-pound fine cloth. As for the spinning, weaving, and dyeing departments, they all have close connections. In the future, when the company is sold to private enterprises, this point must be taken into account in order to avoid losing a factory's performance due to interruptions in the production process. Subsequently, under the guidance of the corporation's deputy chief auditor, 高越天, and the design section chief, 龚苏民, the journalists visited the three factories in order.</p>
<p>Second Textile Factory</p>
<p>Formerly the Neiwai No. 5 Factory, the factory has 46,400 spindles and 23,000 thread spindles, covering a total area of 42 mu. The factory's machinery was built in 1913. When the company took it over, it could only operate a few thousand spindles, but now it is running at full capacity. Last year, the factory produced more than 12,000 bales of yarn, which is equivalent to 20-count standard yarn, and can produce more than 110 bales per day. The factory's equipment is suitable for spinning 42-count cotton yarn and can spin up to 80-count yarn.</p>
<p>First Silk Spinning Factory</p>
<p>Formerly the Kanebo No. 3 Factory, the factory covers an area of more than 35 mu and has a total of 9,900 spinning spindles, 1,470 spun silk spindles, and 313 looms, mainly producing silk and spun silk, and supplementing with Suzhou gauze and ramie spinning. The products are sold in India, Southeast Asia, and the Americas. The factory's average daily production is 474.69 kilograms of silk, 130 kilograms of yarn, 278.46 kilograms of spun silk, and 5,238.02.</p>
<p>First Printing and Dyeing Factory</p>
<p>Formerly formed by merging the No. 1 and No. 2 processing factories belonging to Neiwai Cotton. The factory covers an area of 41.29 mu, and the entire building is made of steel pillars and brick walls. The factory's machinery is divided into three major parts: power, bleaching, dyeing, printing, and finishing, and chemical. It uses 6,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity and 35,000 gallons of water per day, so it has its own water supply equipment. It mainly dyes and bleaches cloth, dyed cloth, and printed cloth. The famous Four Gentlemen serge is one of the factory's products. Currently, the factory can produce 9,500 pieces of cloth per day.</p>

<h3>Stationed at the North Station: Committing Numerous Crimes - Following the "Four Famous Mountains": "Five Tiger Generals" Cracked - Principal Offender Zhu Jinbao Arrested</h3>
<p>The Jinghu District Railway Bureau Police Department has cracked another major pickpocketing gang case. The pickpocketing gang had considerable influence in Shanghai and was known as the "Five Tiger Generals." Their potential influence was no less than that of the "Four Famous Mountains." The mastermind, Zhu Jinbao (alias Zhou Rongbao), has also been arrested. On the morning of the 24th of this month, at around 5:00 AM, police officers from the police department were patrolling the first and second class ticket offices when they saw five young men gradually approaching the ticket window.

The police officers then went forward and arrested them.</p>
<p>According to their confession: one was Zhu Jinbao, and the other was Liu Wenbin. They did not deny the pickpocketing. The suspects were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office on the afternoon of the 25th, but they were released on bail that evening. However, they did not repent. At 2:00 PM on the 26th, they returned to the North Station to "look for business," posing as passengers. Just as they were about to act, they were caught by detective Zhang Mingcao. Only Zhu Jinbao was caught at the time; Liu Wenbin had already escaped. Zhu was taken to the section headquarters for further questioning.</p>
<p>Reviewing old records,</p>
<p>it was learned that the suspect was one of the masterminds of the well-known pickpocket gang "Five Tiger Generals." Since the enemy puppet regime, he has been stationed at the North Station, specializing in pickpocketing on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, committing numerous crimes, totaling thousands. After the victory, the suspects were once arrested by the Third Front Army but were released shortly thereafter. However, they did not change their ways and continued to engage in old cases at the North Station, being arrested by the station more than a dozen times. The suspect admitted to everything in the past. The Railway Police Department believes that the facts are clear and has decided to arrest the accomplices. Zhu Jinbao will be sent to court for prosecution within a few days.</p>

The court stated that 1,058 kilograms of opium soil were found in the flower bed and sent to the Municipal Health Bureau for testing. The maximum morphine content was 0.35%, and the minimum was 0.29%. With such a large amount of drugs hidden in the house, how could they not know? Later, the defendant's defense lawyer argued that ordinary opium usually contains more than 10% morphine, and the drug found had such a small drug content that it should not be considered a drug. The house had previously been the former residence of "Morphine King" Ye Qinghe, so the batch of drugs may have been the residue after Ye extracted morphine from opium at that time. To avoid attracting attention, it was buried in the flower bed, and the defendants have no suspicion of hiding drugs. After the closing arguments, the court ordered the case to be sentenced on April 3.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Shooting of Young Woman: Perpetrator Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] A shooting occurred at No. 203 Lai'an Lane, Xinmin Road, Zhabei, at around 11:30 PM on August 30 last year. At that time, a young woman from Kunshan, Dong Xinwei, was shot by Xie Ronggen, whom she knew, and was hit in the right shoulder and thumb. The perpetrator fled the scene. Her husband, Han Shuifu, took her to the hospital for treatment and reported the incident to the Hongkou Police Station, which dispatched police to pursue the perpetrator but was unable to catch him. The other day, Criminal Division Inspector Song Yuanshan of the Huangpu Police Branch learned that the suspect Xie was hiding in the Zhabei area. He reported to Director Zhang, who ordered Chief Li to supervise Inspector Song and others to lie in ambush at the entrance of Yonghe Lane, Baochang Road. Soon after, Zhu saw the suspect arrive and was immediately arrested. During questioning at the station, he confessed to shooting Han. The reason for the shooting appeared to be that he was involved in drug trafficking and feared that she would report him, so he took this drastic measure. The firearm used was stored by a certain military officer. The branch is currently conducting a thorough investigation.</p>

<h3>Nineteen Government-Funded Students to Study in Switzerland</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Among the second group of government-funded students selected by the Ministry of Education, 19 have applied to go to Switzerland. Wu Nanru, our ambassador to Switzerland, has already liaised with the Swiss education authorities.

<h3>Taiwan's Control of Books and Stationery</h3>
<p>Private Bookstores Feel Threatened</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taipei] Everything in Taiwan is special, everything is under control. There are no state-run bookstores in the mainland, but Taiwan has taken the lead in establishing the state-run Taiwan Bookstore, which edits and prints books and also sells stationery. Thus, books and stationery are also under control. The Governor-General's Office has issued an order to all subordinate units to purchase all books and stationery from the Taiwan Bookstore. In fact, most of the schools in Taiwan are public schools, which belong to the Governor-General's Office. Thus, all the books and stationery needed by schools throughout the province are handled by the government. In the recent spring sales, most of the elementary school textbooks adopted versions from the Taiwan Bookstore. The "Kaiming" bookstore, one of the seven joint bookstores, independently printed and sold the nationally designated Guoding edition of common textbooks with phonetic symbols, which proved to be very profitable. Other bookstores that rushed to transport the Guoding edition of textbooks from Shanghai to Taiwan were almost ignored, suffering heavy losses. According to a person in charge of a bookstore, if this abnormal state continues to exist, legitimate private bookstores will feel deeply threatened. Apart from ending their business as soon as possible and bidding farewell to the Taiwanese people with sadness, there is no other way to survive.</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Ye Qianyu's Works in New York</h3>

<h3>Jiangsu Province Counties Self-Fund Education to Protect Schools</h3>
<p>Gan Yunshou Strongly Opposes Bad Practices in Official Letter to Ministry</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] To ensure funding for national schools, Jiangsu Province counties have traditionally collected education funds as an add-on to land taxes, which are then centrally managed by the county government. Starting this year, most counties have received general orders requiring township and neighborhood chiefs to raise funds themselves, with no further subsidies provided. Gan Yunshou, an educator from the province, believes that this approach has many flaws that would impede the development of national education. He submitted a letter to the Ministry of Education, strongly criticizing the harmful effects and requesting that the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education instruct all counties to promptly withdraw the aforementioned general orders to safeguard education. Recently, Mr. Gan received a reply from the Ministry of Education, document number Guo Zi 15707, stating, "All documents have been reviewed. Approval is granted to forward the matter to the relevant department for investigation and action, followed by a report for verification." It is reported that the Ministry of Education did not agree to this approach beforehand.</p>
<h3>Students at Shanghai University Stage Strike, Presenting Two Demands</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Students at Shanghai University started a strike yesterday to protest the university's decision to suspend a student named Jin for one semester for leaving the campus without permission. They presented two demands to the university: (1) Revoke the decision; (2) Allow students to enter and leave freely; otherwise, they will continue the strike. The university stated that changing school regulations requires approval from the school board, making it difficult to agree to the second point at this time. Regarding the suspension of student Jin, the university has agreed to reduce it to two weeks, but the students stated that this is still unacceptable because the two weeks coincide with the minor exam period. Therefore, they insist on being allowed to take the exams.</p>

<h3>Limited Foreign Tea Trading</h3>
<p>Domestic sales of red-edged tea, which had been overcast for a long time, were still limited to local sales and sales to dealers, lacking any significant improvement. The market situation continued to hover due to the sellers maintaining a neutral sentiment. Foreign trading showed a declining trend, with sellers continuing to offer but buyers remaining hesitant due to the expectation of declining prices. As a result, the market became even more sluggish. Under these circumstances, prices tended to loosen, and all fronts showed signs of retreat.</p>
<h3>Social Bureau Considers Increased Prices for Gold Jewelry Excessive, Will Discuss with Representatives Again Today</h3>
<p>Yao Lianfang, Yao Guiqing, Wu Pengnian, Qiu Liang, Chen Dexin, and other five representatives of the silversmiths' association in this city visited Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday and presented the association's proposed operating expenses: (1) including 18,000 yuan for gold loss and refining fees, (2) 34,500 yuan for interest, (3) 2,500 yuan for packaging, (4) 3,800 yuan for taxes, (5) 3,000 yuan for other expenses, and (6) 45,000 yuan for legitimate profits, totaling 100,680 yuan per tael, requesting the Social Bureau to approve. Director Wu stated that the increase was excessive and promised to forward the matter to the mayor for further decision, and instructed the representatives to go to the Social Bureau for discussion today.</p>
<h3>High-Grade Dried Longan Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Recently, the supply of high-grade dried longan has been low, and the stock is gradually thinning. Production costs have increased significantly, so prices have strengthened, and a few boxes that opened in the market yesterday increased by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wool Raw Material Allocation Committee Decides Iron and Wood Looms Conversion Standard</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Wool Raw Material Allocation Committee recently held a meeting to determine the standard for allocating spindle quotas. As for the allocation method for looms, members Ge Jiezhen and Wu Shan罃 of the committee convened representatives of weaving factories, including Wang Houfu, Tong Shuangyang, and Huang Jinzhuan, at the Wool Spinning Association at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss and determine the following standards: Double-width iron-wood looms are equal to 1/2 iron loom, single-width iron-wood looms are equal to 1/4 iron loom, camel wool round looms are equal to two iron looms, camel wool flat looms are equal to one iron loom, Hebolong iron looms are equal to 1/2 iron loom, and Hebolong wood looms are equal to 1/4 iron loom.</p>
<p>In addition, the committee stated that the wool import quota for February to April of this year is only 1.4 million US dollars, which the industry feels is difficult to allocate. The reasons are: (1) According to the quota, only one-tenth of the raw materials needed by the industry can be met, resulting in each factory only being able to operate for four days per month. (2) Of the 1.4 million dollar quota, 255,000 dollars must be allocated to wool weaving factories, leaving only 1.145 million dollars for spinning factories. The shortage for each factory will have to be met through the black market, but the price is already twice as high as the quota import price. (3) Shanghai currently only has 700,000 pounds of raw materials, which is not enough for the industry's needs for one month. (4) For the sake of simplicity in future raw material allocation, weaving factories hope to use iron looms as the unit. All looms are equivalent to approximately 270 iron loom units. For spinning factories, the standard is 0.4 pounds for spindles, 0.5 pounds for fine yarn, 0.6 pounds for coarse yarn, and 1 pound for coarse spinning ring spindles. The committee will submit a letter to the Quota Allocation Department of the Export Control Commission requesting that the above points be followed.</p>
<h3>Tea Leaf Acquisition: The National Treasury Cannot Bear Profits or Losses; The Method Will Be Completely Changed; The Central Bank Plans to Consult the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>Tea merchants, citing export difficulties, repeatedly requested government purchases last year, which were approved by the then-President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen. Relevant authorities immediately submitted details of the acquisition to the Executive Yuan, which were also approved by President Song this year. The Central Bank immediately began handling the matter with relevant authorities. On the one hand, the Ministry of Finance was notified that the national treasury would bear the profits and losses of the acquisition. Last month, with foreign exchange loans extended, tea merchants again requested more assistance. Recently, Liu, the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, convened representatives of tea merchants to discuss packing loans and export methods, and was preparing to report separately to the Executive Yuan and the Four Banks Joint Treasury for approval when a reply was received from the Ministry of Finance stating: the national treasury has no such budget and cannot bear the profits and losses of tea leaf acquisitions. The Central Bank was requested to consult the Executive Yuan for further instructions. After receiving the letter, the Central Bank considered that since the national treasury had no such budget, the original acquisition method had become invalid. In addition to consulting the Executive Yuan again, the letter from the Ministry of Finance was also notified to the tea merchants. According to the person in charge of the Central Bank: It is difficult to predict what the future method will be. However, it is believed that the government will seek other ways to remedy the export tea industry, and the Central Bank will still do its best to provide assistance. It is heard that the Central Bank plans to invite representatives of tea merchants to exchange opinions in order to report to the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Continues Rationing as Before</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the date for Taiwan Sugar Corporation's rationing again. The price remained the same, and the quota remained the same. The allocation included 50% of raw sugar, 20% of "four and a half" white sugar, and 30% of "two four" coarse white sugar. The guild's market assessment remained strong. Spot prices for "two two" medium sugar white remained unchanged. Secondary double-bagged was 220,000 yuan, and single-bagged was 224,000 yuan. "Two four" coarse white rose by over 10,000 yuan, warehouse receipts rose by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan, "four and a half" military white warehouse receipts rose by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan, and "three and a half" military white rose by 8,000 to 9,000 yuan. Peruvian fine sugar was 218,000 to 220,000 yuan, up by 10,000 yuan. The next period was 222,000 yuan. Numbered goods opened: Shantou Qing at 139,000 yuan, Shunde Qing at 133,000 yuan, Diao Qing at 130,000 yuan, Xinghua white at 200,200 to 200,000 yuan, secondary at 198,000 yuan, Xingchi at 134,000 to 140,000 yuan, with over 300 transactions.</p>
<h3>Silk Transactions Were Very Few</h3>
<p>The decline in rayon prices has stopped, and yesterday's market was the same as the previous day's. 120 count Gaoshan bright yarn opened at 5,923,000 yuan, with no transactions. In the afternoon, it was bid up to 6,050,000 yuan and sold, resulting in a break-even with the previous day. 100 count matte Jianzi goods were quoted at 8,600,000 yuan. Factory silk yesterday E grade opened with more than ten loads, priced at 7,000,000 yuan. There were few transactions for zero lot raw silk. There was an order for five loads of thousand-light goods, still between 5,800,000 and 6,000,000 yuan. The silk market was quiet, prices remained the same, and the number of transactions was extremely small. The reason is that orders for autumn and winter goods have been placed and there is no outlet, while buyers are waiting and delaying due to the cold weather for summer goods, which has led to this situation.</p>
<h3>Light-Colored Woolen Fabrics Sell Well</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the standard market prices for woolen fabrics in various markets remained similar to the previous days. Except for Ulster, which had a large quantity released by non-professionals, coupled with the season, which drove the market downstream, the rest were quietly stable. Light gray floral fabrics were quite short in various stores, and the trend was therefore more brisk. Various women's colored wools in red, yellow, blue, green, gray were selling well, and there was considerable demand from domestic customers. This is because their cost is lighter than men's woolen fabrics, and the profit is not much different. Now that spring is warm, it is the peak season for cheongsam and coat materials, so zero-lot and wholesale transactions are even more active. The supply of goods from incoming shipments and local factories is therefore also very abundant. Top-grade women's colored wools commonly sell for over 100,000 yuan, second-grade for 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, third-grade for 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, and fourth-grade for 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Okinawa Surplus Supplies: The Western Medicine Portion Will Be on the Market</h3>
<p>According to news from the pharmaceutical industry, the surplus supplies purchased by our country from Okinawa, USA, for Western medicine alone, are worth more than US$100 million, enough to supply the entire country for five years. Most of these medicines have already arrived in Shanghai, and a small portion is still being loaded. The portion that has already arrived in Shanghai will soon be on the market, and the price is quite low. The industry is currently meeting to discuss requesting the government to attach a portion of domestic Western medicine during rationing, and at the same time hoping to change the original American-made trademarks to labels of the Materials Supply Bureau, so as to avoid promoting foreign goods.</p>
<h3>This Year's Tea Loan Principles: Application on Site Decided</h3>
<p>According to recent news from the Agricultural Bank, the principles for this year's tea loans have been decided, and tea merchants should apply for loans on site in the purchasing areas (such as Anhui, Tunxi, Qimen, Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Wenzhou, Hunan, Hubei, etc.). As for the total amount of tea loans and detailed loan rules, it is learned that the Four Banks Joint Treasury and the Agricultural Bank are stepping up their discussions and will announce and implement them in the short term.</p>
<h3>More Than a Thousand Tons of Tung Oil: Loaded for Export</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Recently, more than a thousand tons of tung oil have been loaded for export to the United States. It is learned that this tung oil was offered to New York a few months ago. Now that domestic and foreign prices have reached a close point, exports will be greatly reduced. This reporter interviewed extensively about the export situation of tung oil. It is generally believed that the foreign price is fixed and the domestic price has not declined. In the absence of profit for exporters, exports may not occur. However, new oil from the producing areas is about to enter the market, and the domestic price may depreciate due to the abundance of goods. It is expected that the rural goods of tung oil from Hankou and Changsha producing areas will flood the market in large quantities next month, and the price will look soft at that time. The traffic situation this year has improved a lot compared to the past. If the price in the producing areas can be reduced to within 300,000 per municipal load at this time, exports can be increased this year. Yesterday, the spot price opened at 310,000 yuan per municipal load on the general market, 420,000 yuan including barrel, and 400,000 yuan for door sales. The arrival of fixed quantity goods has become rare. A small amount of Xihong has arrived in succession, and few customers are shipping to Shanghai for sale. The goods that have been shipped are all purchased by merchants from the producing areas and shipped to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Cement Industry Trade Association: Held the First Board Meeting; Yan Huiqing and Others Elected as Managing Directors</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The National Cement Industry Trade Association held its first board meeting at 3 pm yesterday. All 21 directors attended, and all supervisors were also present. Yan Huiqing was publicly elected as the temporary chairman, and managing directors were elected by mutual vote. As a result, Yan Huiqing, Liu Hongsheng, Chen Guangfu, Zhang Jun, and Chen Fanyou were elected. Yan Huiqing was also elected as the chairman of the board. A total of ten proposals were discussed:</p>
<p>(1) The association's work program was adopted. The main points are: (A) regarding production, (B) regarding transportation, (C) regarding technology, (D) regarding research. (2) The association's budget for the 36th year was discussed and approved, and will be submitted for ratification at the next members' meeting. (3) The organizational rules of the association's offices (in Nanjing) and administrative offices (one in Shanghai) were discussed and approved. (4) The association's detailed rules of procedure were discussed and approved. (5) It was decided that the location of the association's administrative office should be limited to one place in Shanghai for the time being. (6) Chen Hanqing was hired as the general manager, and Xi Zhengxiu as the deputy general manager. (7) A request will be submitted to the competent authorities for registration and issuance of seals.</p>
<p>(8) During the War of Resistance, the cement industry suffered heavy losses. It is proposed that the association compile detailed statistics of the losses of various factories and submit them to the government to negotiate the dismantling of Japanese factory equipment for compensation to facilitate recovery. According to news from various sources, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Japan approved ten types of Japanese industries to be dismantled for compensation to China, but cement industry was the only one missing. According to investigation, the Japanese cement industry was quite developed before the war. In addition to half of the total production being used for its own use, the remaining half was available for export. Therefore, based on this investigation, negotiations will be conducted to dismantle Japanese factory equipment for compensation. (9) The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Industrial Standards Committee sent a copy of the cement standards it had formulated, instructing the association to inform its members to adopt it. It was resolved to organize a review committee, and Wang Songtao, Xu Zongdong, Yu Zongyu, Chen Fanyou, and Lu Zongxian were appointed as members. Once the review is completed, it will be submitted to the Ministry for approval.</p>
<p>(10) Qixin Yanghui Company, North China Cement Company, etc., requested negotiations to expand the quota for imported burlap bags and to open up the import of gypsum paper bags. It was resolved to authorize the general manager and deputy general manager to handle the matter. According to the note, the quota for burlap bags from February to April this year is only US$1.25 million. This amount can purchase 1.5 million burlap bags. If purchasing cement bags holding 85 kilograms, only 2.27 million bags can be obtained. All imported burlap bags can only hold 190,000 tons of cement, and only 63,000 tons of cement can be filled per month. Moreover, considering the monthly needs of factories such as Qixin, North China, Jiuda, and Yongli in North China alone, 250,000 burlap bags are needed. Therefore, the total burlap bag quota is not enough to meet the needs of North China alone. Cement paper bags cannot be manufactured domestically at present. Gypsum is also one of the main raw materials for cement, accounting for 3% of the total raw material amount, and all of it needs to be supplied from overseas. Therefore, it is urgent to find ways to relax its import quota, otherwise cement production will be unable to continue.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Turns Downward</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market turned downward, and customer sales were as quiet as stagnant water, without any movement. Those who were forced to sell goods allocated by Fangjian the previous day due to tight finances lowered prices to seek sales, causing the price of 20-count yarn to fall by 50,000 to 100,000, and people's hearts turned mediocre as a result. The trend is still a revolving situation.</p>
<h3>Small Denomination Banknotes: Central Bank Recalls and Destroys</h3>
<p>Since the Central Bank issued 5,000 yuan and 250 yuan and 500 yuan customs gold notes, banknotes with numbers such as one, five, ten, and fifty yuan, although not prohibited by the Central Bank, are no longer circulating in the market. In order to maintain the credibility of the currency, the Central Bank specially ordered its branches throughout the country and requested the Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Postal Savings Bureau, and the China Trust Bureau to recall them on its behalf. Among them, the branches of the Farmers Bank of China and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau are widely established in various places, so the effect is quite large. In order to avoid spending a lot of freight, the bank sealed the small denomination banknotes received in various places on the spot, and periodically invited the heads of local administrative agencies, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Audit Department of the Bank's Issuance Bureau to send personnel to jointly burn them. If residents in various places still hold small denomination banknotes, they can still exchange them at the local four banks and two bureaus.</p>
<h3>New York Shanghai Bristles Decline Again: Few Exports, Weak Transactions</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The price of pig bristles has declined, and the price of New York Shanghai bristles has fallen from US$2 per pound to US$1.90 again, and the price of Sichuan bristles has further softened.

Jiangjian Wheel returned to Shanghai from Hankou yesterday, carrying a large number of cotton and tobacco leaves, more than 2,500 pieces of cotton, and more than 3,800 pieces of tobacco leaves.</p>
<h3>Timber Transactions Were Sluggish</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the prices of foreign pine, sawn squares, and plywood remained at the original price levels. Actual sales were sparse. Although cedar strips and floorings were soft, the market atmosphere has gradually loosened due to increased shipping costs and increased labor costs in Fujian.</p>

<h3>A Discussion of Measles</h3>
<p>— Xie Shou</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the occurrence of measles</p>
<p>Why does measles occur? Probably because a filterable ultramicroscopic organism is causing trouble. Such ultramicroscopic organisms exist in the patient's blood; and of course, they also exist in tears, nasal mucus, and phlegm, so they are easily transmitted directly to others through coughing and sneezing.</p>
<p>Measles mostly occurs in late autumn and winter, and in spring, almost every year. However, it can be a few years before it becomes a large-scale epidemic; sometimes every two or three years, sometimes every five or six years. This is because when there is a large epidemic one year, almost all susceptible residents are infected and acquire a certain immunity. Therefore, after a large epidemic, there are several years of calm. During these years of calm, newborn children, of course, have not yet been infected with measles, or when immunity disappears for some reason, a second large-scale epidemic of measles is triggered.</p>
<p>Infants are less likely to be infected, because infants often lie in bedding and have few opportunities to contact children outside. Furthermore, breastfed infants can obtain maternal antibodies from breast milk, which provides some immunity. Therefore, the prognosis of measles infection is often poor in artificially fed infants.</p>
<p>The spread of measles mostly originates in families or among children outdoors. The most important place is schools, because measles patients, even in the incubation period (that is, after measles has been infected, but has not yet been detected, medically called the incubation period), although there are no symptoms on the surface, already have the ability to infect others and can transmit it to others.</p>
<p>Adults rarely develop measles, because most have already developed it in childhood, and after it has occurred, they acquire a certain immunity.</p>
<p>(2) Symptoms of Measles</p>
<p>Measles can be divided into four stages based on its course: the first stage is the incubation period; it lasts about ten days, and the child usually has no symptoms. The second stage is called the prodromal period: a sudden high fever of 39 to 40 degrees Celsius occurs, lasting about one day, and then drops the next morning. At the same time, there is nasal mucus, sneezing, red eyes, tearing, coughing, headache, loss of appetite, etc., like a state of a cold, lasting about three or four days. During this period, there is also early mucosal rash, that is, round, dark red spots appear in the mouth, pharynx, soft palate, etc. The most important thing for diagnosis is the appearance of bluish-white, slightly raised spots on the buccal mucosa opposite the molars, called Koplik's spots. The third stage is called the rash period: that is, the body temperature suddenly rises again, even higher than the first fever, sometimes reaching above 40 degrees Celsius. Then, light red papules begin to appear on the face, shaped like circles or polygons, sometimes merging with each other, but there must be healthy skin between the rashes. Such rashes spread rapidly from the face to the upper part of the trunk, upper arms, lower part of the trunk, upper legs, forearms, hands, lower legs, and feet, covering the whole body. Parents are happy when they see that the child's soles already have a rash. At this time, nasal mucus and tears increase significantly, and coughing is also very severe. In addition, there are headaches, thirst, loss of appetite, and sometimes even delirium, convulsions, etc. After the rash has spread all over the body, it gradually subsides. The entire rash period lasts about four or five days. The fourth stage: the skin rash gradually fades, the epithelium flakes off, and various mucous membrane inflammation symptoms gradually subside, which is called the recovery period.</p>
<p>(3) The Terror of Measles</p>
<p>Measles can be said to be an easy disease, because everyone has to go through it, and it is not seen that everyone loses their lives. However, according to statistics from various countries, among 10,000 children, the number of deaths due to measles is 1.5 in Japan; 11.4 in England; 6.8 in Germany; 5.3 in Switzerland; 30.4 in the Soviet Union; and 6.7 in Italy. Our country does not yet have accurate statistics. When we inquire about medical history in clinical practice, we know that there are indeed many children who die from measles.</p>
<p>Speaking of measles itself, if the course is benign, there is nothing to be afraid of, that is, several variant types; such as papular measles, confluent measles, varicella-like measles, and hemorrhagic measles, are not a big deal. Only one type called black measles, which occurs in children with hemorrhagic diathesis, has a poor course.</p>
<h3>New Position for Sleeping</h3>
<p>— Wang Wangren</p>
<p>The nature of most animals is that they never lie flat until they die. Whether a person is sick or healthy, lying flat on their back all day long for too long is most inappropriate. If a person has a local illness that requires surgery, and surgery is performed, it is a mistake to allow them to lie flat. There are many disadvantages. First, it is easy to cause inflammation of the lungs. Second, it may even lead to lung lobe folding, which is bad for breathing. The third and most dangerous item is "blood clotting (thrombosis)" in the legs, which is not only the "cause" of sudden leg swelling, but can also cause blood clots "emboli" to enter the pulmonary artery, suddenly stopping breathing and resulting in loss of life. Pregnant women who are about to give birth lose blood due to childbirth, which is slightly similar to the bodies of those who have just undergone surgery. It is quite dangerous within ten days after delivery.</p>
<p>In Europe, it is customary to get out of bed nine days after delivery. However, according to the new theory, it is said that one can sit up and rest five days later. This is because, in addition to the above-mentioned three dangers, sleeping for too long can easily lead to muscle malnutrition and "atrophy," and the fourth type of disease is stiff limbs due to inactivity.</p>
<p>If people move more, blood is easier to circulate and muscles get more nutrition. Now, American Air Force hospitals treat wounded soldiers who cannot get out of bed by making them do leg exercises. There is more than one way to exercise. Generally, they make them move interactively like riding a bicycle forward.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is another way to prevent "blood clotting," which is to make the bed they sleep on higher at the foot and slightly lower on the side near the head, making it tilted at a 45-degree angle. This method helps lung breathing and also prevents inflammation of the lungs. New-style hospitals in various countries have generally understood this and have gradually changed to placing this type of inclined bed.</p>

<h3>Hemorrhoids</h3>
<p>— Su Fu</p>
<p>Most hemorrhoid patients, in addition to suffering during bowel movements, most commonly have bloody stools. Yes! The Western name for hemorrhoids is Hemorrhoid - Hemo. The meaning of this word is related to blood. Originally, there are many blood vessels around the anus. These small blood vessels are interconnected and spread all over. Once the exit is blocked, they accumulate blood. This small hoarder accumulates more and more, and as a result, it becomes towering and swollen. Once it encounters external force, when the stool is expelled, the blood breaks out. This accumulates day by day, of course causing anemia. A trickle of water can become a river. Although it is a small hidden disease, the consequences are indeed quite serious.</p>
<p>Originally, blood should flow very smoothly, but many people with habitual constipation have hard stools that accumulate in the rectum, pressing on the blood vessels near the anus. During bowel movements, the person strains forcefully, and the blood vessels become even more swollen. Cause and effect cycle, hemorrhoids are caused by constipation, and hemorrhoids cause even more constipation, so the prevention of hemorrhoids! The first is to make bowel movements smooth, which is the root of the problem.</p>
<p>Some people say that people who drink alcohol are very likely to develop hemorrhoids. In fact, this is indeed the case. People who drink alcohol are prone to liver disease. The blood vessels in the liver are medically called the portal vein, and the blood vessels near the anus are connected to the portal vein. After liver disease, the circulation of the portal vein will be hindered, indirectly affecting the circulation of blood near the anus, of course creating opportunities for blood accumulation, leading to the source of hemorrhoids.</p>
<p>When a woman is pregnant, her belly contains a new life, which blocks the blood flow in the lower part of the mother's body, so there is swelling of the feet, etc. The blood vessels near the anus are neighbors, so they also accompany the last seat. At the time of childbirth, it is like ten thousand horses galloping, using all their strength to squeeze the child out. All the strength is downward. On the one hand, the blood flow is already poor, and on the other hand, this squeeze makes the blood vessels near the anus even more successful in selling their belly. So during childbirth, a small head sticks out of the vagina above the anus, and a mass of things is also squeezed out of the anus. When he comes, he goes downstream, but when he leaves, it is not easy to invite him back. So if our mother has hemorrhoids, it is really the son's fault. When we think of our mother's hemorrhoids, we should do our filial duty even more.</p>
<p>Many cultural workers spend most of their time sitting. And so on, many gamblers are addicted to the mahjong table all day long, lack exercise, and blood flow is therefore impeded, accumulating near the anus, which is also prone to hemorrhoids, so we must move often, which is not unrelated.</p>
<p>As for external hemorrhoids and internal hemorrhoids, this is just a difference in the location where they grow, and we don't need to worry too much about it.</p>
<p>Because hemorrhoids have unspeakable discomfort and hidden pain, most people first think of applying some medicine. In the case of internal hemorrhoids, they get some injections locally, hoping to eliminate themselves, but perhaps they see a slight effect, or perhaps they recur. Patients hope that one dose will cure them and the disease will be cured by medicine, but doctors are powerless. In the end, most people undergo surgery. The results of surgery may recur. After recurrence, of course, they blame the previous doctor's bad work and ask a second doctor to treat them. In fact, it's ridiculous. The patient continues to revel, plays mahjong day and night, and is still constipated. They continue to give birth without solving the root cause, so of course they will not get better. Of course, there is no way to avoid childbirth, only obstetricians. Be careful temporarily. But other kinds of lifestyle improvements and good habits are not too difficult. Turning back is the shore.</p>
<p>In addition to hemorrhoids, there are many other diseases near the anus that cannot be lumped together, such as anal fissures, which can also cause large amounts of bleeding, and perianal inflammation is even more painful. There is also a large piece of rectal prolapse that protrudes. Anal fistulas, which we call "feces-stealing rats" in the countryside, often discharge pus. Although each has its own cause, it is not unrelated to smooth bowel movements and cleanliness near the anus. Therefore, people with hemorrhoids, I hope you wash your anus with water after each bowel movement. Drink more water, eat more fruits and vegetables, exercise more, and even use glycerin suppositories or enemas. In short, it is most important to make bowel movements smooth every day.</p>
<p>Hemorrhoids, this is a common name, the scientific name is hemorrhoidal nodules or hemorrhoids.</p>
<h3>Medical Correspondence</h3>
<p>Replies to Mr. Zhang Xin Xinwu and Mr. Li Qifan</p>
<p>(1)  Popularly, masturbation is called illegally releasing semen, but in fact, nocturnal emission is also a type of illegal semen release. Although one is intentional and the other unintentional, the illness is the same. Therefore, young people who masturbate are most prone to nocturnal emission. And those who want to cure nocturnal emission should regard completely abstaining from masturbation as the only way.</p>
<p>(2)  Nocturnal emission and neurasthenia are mutually causal: excessive nocturnal emission can lead to neurasthenia, and neurasthenia can also lead to nocturnal emission. Those who suffer from nocturnal emission without masturbating are mostly caused by neurasthenia. Tranquilizers such as potassium bromide and sodium bromide can calm oversensitive nerves and are symptomatic drugs for neurasthenia; therefore, they can also be used to treat nocturnal emission.</p>
<p>(3)  Frequent ejaculation is not necessarily a fatal disease, and it is even less of a problem for development; therefore, patients do not need to be overly pessimistic. On the one hand, it is appropriate to seek medical advice; on the other hand, it is even more important to strive to boost one's spirit. If one's spirit is invigorated and one's will is firm, nocturnal emission can be cured even without medication.</p>
<p>(4)  In addition, patients with diabetes, spinal tuberculosis, and prostatitis may also occasionally experience nocturnal emission. But this is a minority; they should be diagnosed and treated by specialists. Moreover, in addition to nocturnal emission, there should be other symptoms that reveal the original disease. Therefore, it is easy to distinguish from the nocturnal emission suffered by ordinary people, so I will not go into detail here. (Ma Dian)</p>

<h3>Sichuan Flavor</h3>
<p>— Yan Zhewu</p>
<p>(1) First Impression</p>
<p>Boating through the Three Gorges, steep cliffs and shallow shoals, the peaks turn and the road winds, orange groves along the mountain, dots of vermilion red, fragrance of rind everywhere, the first impression of entering Sichuan is the red oranges and mandarins in winter and the white-turbaned men of Sichuan! There is also a record of red oranges and mandarins in the Wonders of Ancient and Modern Times, as if those entering Shu once cited it as a way to achieve proper governance, but I never thought that after some years, West Shu would also have large orange groves! I spent eight years in Sichuan, and every winter I bought piles of oranges and mandarins to keep at home, sometimes roasting them to eat, and sometimes specially boiling them into "orange jam". In the first year I entered Sichuan, I was almost addicted to eating oranges and mandarins! Later, I stayed briefly in Jiang'an, and visited the orange groves! It was easy to live in Beibei, and I bought them by the hundreds on orange boats on the Jialing River, and even ran into the orange groves to pick them myself. The joy of this still feels fresh today! It is said that Sichuan's fruits such as oranges, mandarins, pomelos, and watermelons were all transplanted from other provinces, especially those brought to Sichuan by migrants from Guangdong.</p>
<p>The white turban is the "mourning cloth" brought by the people of the Lower Yangtze, said to be originally in mourning for Zhuge Wuhou. However, mountain mists are everywhere in Sichuan, which can easily lead to headaches, so people mostly wrap their heads in white cloth as a substitute for hats, which is also a reason.</p>
<p>This white turban was banned during the Anti-Japanese War because of enemy air raids, but it was difficult to change because of years of customs, so protection personnel often shouted "take off the white turban!"</p>
<p>Accompanying the white turban is a kind of "warming basket", just like the "fire pot" of the Lower Yangtze, which is used to warm hands and feet. Those using fire often have a "white turban" tied on their heads, a "warming basket" in their hands, and another hand taking a "bamboo joint" made of tobacco pipe, leisurely smoking tobacco leaves, giving a unique leisurely flavor!</p>
<p>(2) Unique Language Interests</p>
<p>The language of Sichuan is quite refined, often speaking in prose! But there are also those who use swearing as a verbal tic! For example, "ge (auxiliary word) guier" "gou (auxiliary word) laozi", in addition to special grammatical organization such as "ying shi" "yao de" "yao bu de". The character "de" is often read as "Dai"! "What" is said as "sangzi", "　zi."</p>
<p>There are even a few words whose meanings are fundamentally different from those of the Lower Yangtze: for example, "ba men shuan qi" (bolt the door), you can't read it like that, you must change it to say "ba men cha dao" (insert the door bolt)! On the contrary, "tie people up" must be changed to say "ba ta shuan (read as shuan) qi"! Therefore, Sichuan's prisoners are tied up with ropes with their arms and hands tied behind their backs, which is the meaning of "shuan".</p>
<p>When we first arrived in Chengdu, Brother Yang Cunbin once asked a farmer from Xindu County who came to help perform before the opening of "Rear Defense" for a "wooden mallet", saying: "Bring me that hammer!" Some people laughed there, and I asked them: "What are you laughing at?" They said: "Hammer" in Sichuan means the male genitals! I suddenly realized, told Cunbin, and we laughed at each other.</p>
<p>(3) Between Mountains and Rivers</p>
<p>Sichuan is mountainous on all sides, so there are many "mountain cities"; the characteristics of mountain cities are mostly "slopes", mostly "steps" "uphill" "downhill", often a mountain city is divided into "upper city" "middle city" "lower city". There are houses on top of houses, and people on top of people, and often the bungalows are along the street, and underground along the steps, there may even be one or two floors underground! So looking at the bungalows on that street surface, they are actually on the third floor! Since there are many slopes and steps, walking up and down, the legs are quite suffering, often using sedan chairs instead. Sichuan's sedan chairs mostly have short front poles and long rear poles, so you are not afraid of being steep when going downhill, so that the sedan chair sitter does not fall, and when going uphill, the sedan chair carriers behind push against the long poles to make the sedan chair carriers in front move forward, and the sedan chair sitters can often lie on their backs with their feet facing the sky! More convenient and elastic than sedan chairs are sliding stretchers (some people write it as raft stretchers). The seat is made of bamboo strips tied together in rows, which can hold the buttocks of the person sitting, and the person can lie horizontally on their back with their feet on another bamboo strip. Long-distance travelers often add quilts, cushions and lie down, but sometimes when Sichuan people die, those who cannot afford to buy coffins to bury them also use bamboo mats to wrap them up and put them on sliding stretchers to be carried away, dig a pit and bury them! After entering Sichuan, arriving in Wanxian, the pier is a stone slope of two hundred and dozens of steps, enough to climb up! Outsiders who come for the first time are quite unaccustomed! Ordinary people living in Chongqing do not go out without climbing slopes and walking steps! For those with heart disease, this is a "taboo" thing!</p>
<p>I once traveled alone to Mount Emei, which is full of steep slopes. Each level has one hundred steps, and each stone surface is only five or six inches wide. Sometimes there is moss on it, and if you don't step carefully, you can easily fall off the mountain cliff, which is frightening! Therefore, those slopes are named "Guangxin Slope" "Zuantian Slope", etc., which make people's heads ache just by hearing the names!</p>
<p>High mountains must have large water. The water flow in Sichuan is turbulent, with waterfalls running rampant, and flash floods occur occasionally, often flooding. There are "tan", "tuo", and "bei" near the water. "Tan" are mostly sand and stones standing in the heart of the river, which are fully exposed when the water is shallow, so they are also called "shallow beaches". Shallow beaches are the most difficult to cross, the water flow is dangerous, and "crossing the beach" is the most intense moment for boatmen to fight with nature with their lives. There are trackers who pull the boat, and the back-pullers are always in a string. I lived on the banks of the Jialing River for four years, and I often heard cries for help in the middle of the night in spring, summer, autumn and winter! On days of heavy water, floating corpses passed by, and overturned boats sent paddles floating, screams and cries, which often made people tremble. This natural threat often adds a shadow to people's lives!</p>
<p>My home is in "Zhangjia Tuo", and friends have also lived in "Tangjia Tuo", "Lijia 　"! This word "tuo" is also unique to Sichuan, it represents a peninsula village near the water. It is a new word only found in Sichuan. Similarly, my home is in Beibei, and the meaning of the word "bei" is probably a stone beach across the heart of the river. "Beibei" is named after the "bei" stone that obstructs the Jialing River flow between Chaoyang Town and Dongyang Town Huangtong Town on the opposite bank. This word "bei" also seems to be rarely seen elsewhere.</p>
<p>(4) Strange Taste Mouth!</p>
<p>Entering Kui Gate, tasting Sichuan flavors, from eating, seeing "sea pepper" and "spicy oil" everywhere, one can get a glimpse of the preferences of Sichuan people's spleen and stomach! Some people say that Sichuan has a lot of fog and heavy humidity, and people eat more spicy food to relieve miasma and maintain health, which is considered reasonable. In Chongqing, we are used to eating carp braised with "White Rose" bean paste and chili, as well as steamed pork with rice flour, without wine, without scallions and garlic, just mixed with chili to remove all fishy smell! The hot pot of "Hot Pot Tripe" is like the mutton hot pot in Beijing. Its basic original soup contains the three flavors of "sour", "spicy", and "numb". Sour is vinegar, spicy is sea pepper, and numb is Sichuan pepper. Therefore, those who eat tripe hot pot are all sweating profusely from the spiciness. In addition, Chengdu's "Wu's Wonton" and "Gugu Banquet" are even more famous places to eat that pay attention to seasoning. In Xufu, I have eaten "Bangbang Chicken", also known as "Strange Flavor Chicken". In fact, it is just chicken legs and chicken meat, with chili, sugar, salt, sauce, sesame paste, scallions and other seasonings!</p>
<p>"Stir-fried hands" are "wonton"! The exquisite ones use real chicken soup, with little oil, good ingredients, and fresh taste. Some people say that rat meat should also be added.</p>
<p>Chengdu is the most particular place for "snacks" in Sichuan. There are so-called "Drunk and Never Return Small Wine Shop" and other store names everywhere, cheap and beautiful! Sichuan rice is sold by the bowl, and one bowl is called a "mao er (hat?) tou" (maybe it's a homophone), I don't know how this name originated!</p>
<p>"Pickled vegetables" and "preserved mustard tuber" are unique products of Sichuan. The method is actually very simple, but the taste is delicious.</p>
<p>Among the vegetarian dishes, there is a kind of "konjac". At first, I thought it was fake "braised eel", but later I learned that it is a gelatinous substance, made by mixing the juice extracted from a plant with cooked water! It is said to be rich in nutrients.</p>
<p>"Fish-flavored shredded pork", "twice-cooked pork", and "stir-fried cured pork" are my favorite Sichuan dishes! Sichuan people love to drink, and there are many ways to persuade people to drink, there is the so-called art of "composing wine". People who have lived in Sichuan often have to socialize with local "gentry and grain officials", and they are inevitably forced to "break the rule" and cannot escape the joke of "being drunk". There are people in Sichuan who can drink and have nicknames such as "drunk for seven days", "drunk and never wake up", "can't wake up", and "wine jar", which shows the "sea" volume of alcohol!</p>
<p>White fungus, summer worm winter grass and other unique tonics in Sichuan, I am not interested in, so I have no connection with them!</p>
<h3>Spring Birds</h3>
<p>— Zhang Shuqi</p>
<h3>Loneliness</h3>
<p>— Si Xiu</p>
<p>The night is deep.</p>
<p>On the desk, the wick of the oil lamp reveals a dim red spark; the faint light shines on the gray mud wall, infinitely gloomy. The slightly swaying and swinging lamp flame seems to be a tired shadow smiling insidiously. The winter sky - a thick lead gray sky - unfolds again before my eyes.</p>
<p>I have returned from a distant dream, a dream woven from strands of affection; lying on a narrow and hard bed, tossing and turning, unable to fall asleep again. Quietly, I listen: to the decadent ancient city's nighttime groans, to the harsh wind's unbridled roar, to the silent sighs and resentment of the stars drowned by the darkness of night...</p>
<p>The rustling cold wind, as if a polite guest, knocks frequently on the dilapidated window sill; a heavy and peaceful heart stirs up a layer of ripples, and the waves of emotion are surging.</p>
<p>Silently, let the insomnia-induced emotions take over.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I feel: as if outside the window is an boundless, azure and bright sky; on the vast border, a few wisps of light clouds, like dots, flutter lightly...</p>
<p>A force of sincerity is pulling me, an alluring, simple and beautiful smiling face is beckoning.</p>
<p>So, I put on my thin clothes, gently push open the door, and walk into the depths of the night.</p>
<p>The alley is hazy with the darkness of night. A long period of years has trained my night eyes with the smoke of war, distinguishing the puddles scattered on the ground. At first, I feel it difficult, a little hesitant; but soon I get used to it.</p>
<p>After a long journey, suddenly a series of light laughter comes, that laughter is filled with the happiness and warmth of true feelings, and those smiling faces are so admired and blessed.</p>
<p>A current of passionate surge rolls on the quiet earth of the night, towards the depths of people's hearts.</p>
<p>Gradually, I feel the warmth, as if that current of passionate surge pours into my heart, filling the flow of my life. However, it is not long before I feel that these are just fleeting clouds in the sky, in my soul...</p>
<p>The dry heart field still has not lubricated the rusted heart door, my heart door is ultimately tightly closed.</p>
<p>Uncontrollably, I raised my head. The azure sky has been painted dark by the god of night, and not a single star is showing its face, twinkling with faint light in the sky. This gray and desolate sky is just like the hidden core of my heart.</p>
<p>A gust of cold wind wanders lonely across the night's fields.</p>
<h3>Yan Liu Lyrics</h3>
<p>— A Long</p>
<p>Yan Shu, with outstanding talent, loved poetry and lyrics, and wrote the Pearl Jade Lyrics. He once wrote a song called Huan Xi Sha, with the lines "A new tune with a glass of wine, The weather last year at the old pavilion, When will the setting sun return? There's nothing to be done as the flowers fall..." At this point, he couldn't continue, and Shu was sad for a long time. Later, he passed Yangzhou because of something, and a man named Wang Qi continued with the two lines "It seems like I've seen the swallows return, Wandering alone in the small garden's fragrant path", and thus Huan Xi Sha was completed. Shu was overjoyed, and hailed the good lines endlessly, and then appointed Qi as the prefect, and for a time the world passed it on as a good story.</p>
<h3>Deep Alley</h3>
<p>— Lin Cheng</p>
<p>Deep alley</p>
<p>A few drops of tinkling fall;</p>
<p>The fortune teller sighs,</p>
<p>The sighing person hopes for something to pawn.</p>
<p>Playing with destiny and</p>
<p>Being played by destiny;</p>
<p>Life and dream</p>
<p>Originally the same!</p>
<p>The sleeping one is mumbling;</p>
<p>The awake one is groping.</p>
<p>Just like a deep alley,</p>
<p>Wearing a gray dress,</p>
<p>Shining a light,</p>
<p>Thinking about the sun...</p>
<h3>Melancholy Grass</h3>
<p>— Lü Zhuang</p>
<p>Purple melancholic narcissus decorates the desk</p>
<p>Exquisite flowers like paper umbrellas</p>
<p>I receive the shade and quietness, like smoke like a dream</p>
<p>Let the bees of thought fly around</p>
<p>On the weak edge, tomorrow, the flowers will wither and the leaves will wither</p>
<p>I will also be buried in that cup of mud</p>
<p>Will another kind of color be changed on the desk?</p>
<p>The second person seeing the scenery has the same state of mind</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, An Inch of Blood 206</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>We were about to hear how He Jian was going to reply to Pingzi, but there was no voice coming, but we clearly heard the sound of rubbing a lighter, presumably He Jian was "fueling up"; after a while, the transmitter made a rhythmic clicking sound, and I could imagine that He Jian must be behind his hands, pacing back and forth in the room. This was his habit of using his mind when the problem was serious. We waited quietly for a while before we heard the footsteps suddenly stop:</p>
<p>"Okay," He Jian's voice, "Definitely going... but I have to say goodbye to a friend... do you agree?... "</p>
<p>"That's for sure... but I also have a request..." Pingzi seemed to be smiling</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"Before leaving, I would like to ask Big Brother to introduce me to your esteemed friends; Yue Jun, and that little one... what's her name? She's so beautiful! I feel ashamed. And another one, is that her younger brother? Such terrifying eyes, like golden light shooting out... "</p>
<p>"As for the introduction, I agree very much. Especially the leader of the general team here... but I have to ask for the consent of a few of them first... if they agree, I would like to spend thirty minutes holding a small banquet. This is to repay the hospitality of the leader of the general team here... "</p>
<p>"That's even better... I don't know if they are willing to see a monster like me?"</p>
<p>"I'll make a phone call to try." He Jian said this.</p>
<p>As before, as soon as W Jun heard that He Jian was going to make a phone call, he immediately stopped the "transmitter" and closed the drawer.</p>
<p>In the phone call, W Jun will meet He Jian in ten minutes. I know W Jun's intention; because there are still a few procedures here that must be arranged. The first important arrangement is that we must disperse a little and change the tense mood after we have heard this great news. This is an important psychological arrangement. In addition, W Jun must also ask for our consent, who is willing to see Pingzi, who is not willing to see Pingzi, and then W Jun will arrange. Furthermore, W Jun must ask us to discuss in these few minutes the secret of everyone hearing this "secret of eight"; who tells He Jian, or temporarily does not explain it to him. But there must be a consistent attitude, so as not to cause him to be stimulated. At the same time, I also want to ask Mr. Dai for instructions on what action we should take on this information.</p>
<p>Sure enough, as soon as W Jun put down the phone, he explained to Yaoqun and me the few points that I had guessed. Our small group meeting was only four or five minutes and was over. The most important resolution was that I personally would explain to He Jian in advance the fact that he had listened to his conversation with Pingzi. This is a preparatory action; because Mr. Dai hopes to understand Pingzi's work steps, and is willing to do his best to cooperate with each other to destroy this "eight" plan.</p>
<p>As soon as this small group discussion was learned, I suddenly noticed that Yaoqun's attitude was somewhat different.</p>
<p>"Team leader, if you allow it, I have to go too!" Yaoqun hesitated for a moment, and said to W Jun.</p>
<p>"Huh", W Jun was stunned. This is probably also somewhat aware of Yaoqun's attitude, suddenly changed, unable to grasp her sudden motivation for a while.</p>
<p>Seeing that W Jun was stunned, Yaoqun immediately felt that her attitude had changed too quickly, and seemed to be a bit of a common routine for children, and was a bit lacking in generosity, so she quickly stated:</p>
<p>"It's still the plan to go to Shanxi... I predict that Mr. Gu and their work in the south may not be able to succeed satisfactorily, and this battle will have to be fought... A large part of the National Army is preparing to go west, so I want to ask you to send me to Shanxi according to the original plan... it's good to do something".</p>
<p>At this time, I saw that Yaoqun's spirit was very high; looking at her expression and hearing her words, I knew that a kind of inexplicable illusion had arisen in her subconscious, and I was afraid that even she herself did not know it. In simple words; she, a woman's competitive psychology, has already taken control of her entire reason.</p>
<p>"Oh! W Jun immediately understood everything; "Okay, very good, definitely do it according to the original plan, now please start preparing."</p>
<p>Finally, I saw Mr. Dai also nodding there, indicating his approval. (End of the seventh meaning)</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Art and Literary Circle</h3>
<p>Cultural figures currently living in Taiwan include Xu Shoushang, Li Helin, Li Lie-wen, Tai Jingnong, Li Jiye, Ou Tansheng, etc., mostly working in the Provincial Translation Bureau, newspapers, and Taiwan University.</p>
<p>Among the Shanghai literary publications sold in Peiping, there are "Literary Autumn Forest", "Literary Renaissance", "Literary Tide", etc. In addition, soft publications such as "Teahouse Talk", "West Point", and "Happiness" sell extremely well. Among the literary publications, according to statistics, "Literary Autumn Forest" sells about 140 to 180 copies indefinitely, "Literary Renaissance" sells 50 to 60 copies, and "Literary Tide" is sold by the Peiping Zhengzhong Bookstore, so the number of basic subscribers is high, and retail sales are not smooth.</p>
<p>Although Peiping is a large cultural city, literary publications have stagnated. "Literary Times" has not been seen since its sixth issue in December last year, and it is thought to have ended its life. "Literature and Life", edited by the Literary Association, is also often out of date, and the content is also very trivial. And the "Modern Literary Record" co-edited by Shen Congwen, Zhu Guangqian, Yang Zhensheng, Feng Zhi, Xu Ying, etc., published its first collection in December last year, and the second collection is also difficult to produce, I am afraid that the future is not optimistic.</p>
<p>Novelist Wang Xiyan still lives in Fuzhou. Recently, in response to the invitation of his Shanghai friend Fan Quan, he has begun writing a 200,000-word novel "The Dream Seeker".</p>
<p>Former principal of the Municipal Experimental Drama School, Xian Zhongyi, has returned to Suzhou after resigning from his school duties.</p>

<h3>Questioning the "Kuang Chung" Charity Sale</h3>
<p>— A Newspaper Reader</p>
<p>The words "Kuang Lu" seem quite familiar to me. I recall before the War of Resistance, I once received training at Mount Lu. During the war, after the fall of Wuhan, I temporarily took refuge in Luling. Therefore, the words "Kuang Lu" are truly indelible in my mind. Whenever I read the newspaper, books, or graded papers, I always paid close attention whenever I encountered the words "Kuang Lu."</p>
<p>This morning, while reading the Shen Bao, I saw an education news item stating that "Kuang Lu" Middle School in this city was holding a charity sale to build school buildings. At noon, while visiting a friend, I also saw an invitation for Kuang Lu Middle School's 30th Anniversary Education Fundraiser, which included a raffle charity sale. Upon carefully reading the distinguished names on the invitation, all were contemporary social figures and education officials, making me even more excited. Because "Kuang Lu" has a connection with me, and now "Kuang Lu" Middle School is raising education funds, why not help "Kuang Lu's" righteous cause? So, I took the Kuang Chung invitation and hurried home to discuss it with my wife, intending to pawn one of her ornaments to support the Kuang Chung charity effort. Initially, my wife gladly agreed, but after carefully considering it, it seemed questionable. Looking at the Kuang Chung invitation again, it stated that it was for the 30th anniversary, proving that the school has a 30-year history. However, my wife and I have lived in Shanghai for 20 years and have been involved in the Shanghai education sector for over a decade, yet we seem to have never heard of this Kuang Lu Middle School in this city that has been around for decades. Fearing I was forgetful, I inquired with friends, but none knew when the school was founded. Furthermore, I checked the list of public and private middle schools in the Municipal Education Bureau's educational weekly, but found nothing. This is the first point of doubt. Furthermore, I reviewed the names of the "Kuang Chung" Education Fund Committee, and the last signature was Wang Guanmou. I recall seeing in the local news section of the Qianhua News a report that a certain Wang Guanmou, who claimed to be a National Assembly representative, forged seals and documents and fraudulently obtained a large industrial and commercial loan under the name of a certain factory. Because the crime occurred during the amnesty period, the court refused to accept the case. This is the second point of doubt. I remember that the name "Kuang Lu" was associated with a "Kuang Lu Elementary School" in the Jiangxi Guild Hall in the southern part of the city before the war, which seems to have a connection with "Kuang Lu." Chang Le Road in this city has a "Jiangxi Middle School," and before the war, there was a Jiangxi Vocational High School (note: during the War of Resistance, the Jiangxi Vocational High School had a school building on Nanshi Railway Station Road, which was demolished by the Japanese invaders, resulting in significant losses). This is the third point of doubt.</p>
<p>Now, the Kuang Lu Middle School 30th Anniversary Education Fund Committee is widely distributing invitations, each with a charity raffle ticket, stating that each ticket costs 400,000 national currency. Based on the huge numbers on the ticket, one can imagine the large amount of money to be raised. I am afraid that some scoundrels are deceiving local officials and social figures to raise money through this scheme. As a newspaper reader, I have the following questions:</p>
<p>(1) Who are the school board members of Kuang Lu Middle School? Who is the principal? When was it approved for establishment?</p>
<p>(2) Where was the pre-war school building of Kuang Lu Middle School located in this city? Where is it located now? How many classes are there? How many students are there?</p>
<p>(3) Who was the original founder of Kuang Lu Middle School? Is it public or private?</p>
<p>(4) How many students have graduated from Kuang Lu Middle School over the years? Who is in charge of the Kuang Lu Middle School alumni association?</p>
<p>I request that the Kuang Lu Middle School Education Fund Committee publicly answer the above questions to dispel doubts and benefit the righteous cause.</p>
<h3>Worthless</h3>
<p>— Chen Dexin</p>
<p>Wang Fengxi, a primary school student in Beiping, was brutally shot and killed. After several days of negotiations, the compensation was US$833.33 (equivalent to 10 million legal currency). After deducting funeral expenses, there is likely little left. Chinese people are worthless, and I can't help but feel a thousand emotions!</p>
<h3>Collection Novels and Collection Paintings</h3>
<p>In the past, collection novels were popular. At that time, Haoran, Duhe, and Zhiyan, Zhenya, Shannong, Tianxu Wosheng and others took the lead in this trend. With great enthusiasm, they created the art of collection novels, each person writing one section, linking them together to form a longer work. The author had to embed the name of the next author in the previous section, showing ingenuity. I still remember such works as "Sea Moon," "Strange Electricity," "Wanwang Peng," "Red Leaf Village Hero," "Night Voyage," "Rice Pearl," "Strange Handprint," "Coral Island," "New Mockery," "Hoarding Hatred," etc. Due to their popularity with readers, single volumes of collection novels were compiled and published. How quickly times have changed. Zhiyan, Zhenya, Shannong, Tianxu Wosheng and other literary figures, once prominent, who influenced an era, now have grass growing on their graves, fallen and buried. Only Duhe and Haoran remain like flickering lights in a deserted temple. But beautiful faces are hard to maintain, and their hair is now graying; they are growing old. A few days ago, I met them at the Changhong Painting Society, where Kongwo, Xuejiao, Shufan, Tingyun, and Jichen were also present. It was an unexpected and delightful meeting. Changhong was run by Qing Xie and Xian Ou, and their brushwork was outstanding and colorful. Jichen playfully painted camellias on plain silk, Kongwo added leaves, and Tingyun added bamboo. Duhe and Haoran looked at each other and smiled, saying: "This is the old-fashioned collection style. We might as well revive it." So, they rolled up their sleeves, Duhe painted plum blossoms, Haoran painted rocks, and Xuejiao and I each painted a gnarled pine branch. Xian Ou's daughter, Caiqin, added a lingzhi mushroom on the rock, and Shufan added the inscription. Xian Ou polished it, and it turned out to be quite beautiful. Xian Ou's talented students Xu Qingyun, Lu Qingping, Chen Cuie, Zhang Qigu, Tian Wenying, and Zhang Shengmei, excited to try their hand, also collaborated on several paintings, like Shu brocade and Qi silk, intricately woven and dazzling, with harmonious colors, truly a great event of the time.

<h3>"Price Sickness"</h3>
<p>— A Newsboy</p>
<p>The First World War discovered "shell shock," but here and now, we have discovered "price sickness."</p>
<p>Life is, after all, of primary importance, so the level of prices strongly stimulates everyone's nerves. The increase in prices compresses everyone's life; a doubling of prices compresses people's lives by half. Now, this phenomenon is deepening and expanding. The rise in prices does not stop due to the freezing of the cost-of-living index, just as the large bills of 5,000 and 10,000 yuan do not stop being issued despite the appeals of the legislators.</p>
<p>In bombings, in prices, in war, everyone suffers from heart disease to some extent, or, due to too much stimulation, everyone becomes neurasthenic. This was the case during the war. As for now, it is not too far removed. Prices are still a heavy term, like a heavy lead weight pressing down on people's hearts.</p>
<p>Here is an example of "price sickness": A few days ago, a news report stated that a person from Shijiazhuang said that a certain gentleman in that area went shopping one day and suddenly became ill after inquiring about the prices. It was learned that this person had suffered a nervous breakdown in the rear during the war due to high prices.</p>
<p>A nervous breakdown caused by rising prices, an illness caused by the shock of high prices—this is ultimately a tragedy for small people in a great era. This is also the common experience of us small people. When the market prices change from morning to evening, and then develop into changing several times a day, when the price tags of goods cannot even be changed in time and are simply removed altogether, everyone is frightened and feels that the bundles of money in their pockets are decreasing in weight and value minute by minute.</p>
<p>Life is an extremely serious word. High prices and difficult living conditions are a severe blow to people. Those who can withstand the blow live on in misery, and those who cannot withstand the blow naturally fall ill.</p>
<p>Therefore, some people become ill after inquiring about prices, and some even suffer nervous breakdowns due to soaring prices.</p>
<p>This price sickness is incurable, isn't it? If there is a cure, we must ask our political masters.</p>
<h3>On "Unsentimental Antithetical Couplets"</h3>
<p>— Ting Song</p>
<p>Antithetical couplets have words that match perfectly but meanings that are completely different. This is called an "unsentimental antithetical couplet." This is also the ultimate expression of the cunning of scholars. During the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods, there was a society that specialized in making such couplets, and Zhang Wenxiang was also a member. One day, he created the couplet "The tree is already half withered, so stop the axe." Initially, Nancun was not selected for this assignment. The one who won the top prize prepared to divide the three-legged tripod and exercise power. Zhang read it and suddenly said: "This couplet can be said to be completely unrelated." So he added these seven characters, and the previous couplet was relegated to second place. Wenxiang was truly brilliant and insightful, with the style of Ji Xiaolan. In short, Chinese characters are truly rich in mystery. If interpreted rigidly, they are not masterpieces. Therefore, the original two lines of the upper couplet still had poetry and truth. But Wenxiang's response was completely conversational. The word "fruit" corresponds to the word "tree" and the word "axe" corresponds to the virtual with the real. Is it not wonderful until the autumn hairs are reversed?</p>
<p>Mao Heting loved to eat at Guangheju. One day, I was at the same table with him, and I happened to mention this couplet. Mao said: "This is a copy of Zhang Zhidong's trick to Taoran." There is also one that uses Zhang Xiangtao to counter the opening of a smelly ditch. Someone else at the table mentioned a couplet: "The day before yesterday, in the Fuchuan Hall in the eastern city, I ate Sichuan pickled vegetables fried with shredded mountain chicken." A certain famous scholar suddenly said: "I have a match!" Namely "Cen Chunxuan bows to Lu Fengshi." (The characters for "shredded" and "stone" are homophones, so it is skillfully done.) This couplet is also completely unrelated in meaning, but each character is perfectly matched, a work of genius, truly beyond what one could imagine. Buddha said: "Its mystery is inconceivable," which is probably what he meant.</p>
<h3>Record of a City in Danger</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Little Rong looked at him timidly and moved closer to his mother.</p>
<p>"Why hasn't elder sister come yet? Mom!" he asked anxiously, looking up.</p>
<p>In the dim light of the kerosene lamp, Lan saw that the associate directors were deliberately pulling Jin Aili towards a more remote corner. She worried that the poor girl was about to step into another trap. But she had no mind to care about others' affairs now. Soon she turned her gaze away, looking at the dark hole, and gently patted Rong's shoulder to calm him down.</p>
<p>From outside the cave came the muffled thunder of bombs exploding, mixed with the tight sound of machine guns.</p>
<p>"This is terrible," Xu Shaoming said anxiously, slapping his thigh and raising his voice to the point of shouting. "All my furniture is loaded on several tarpaulin trucks packaged by Bai, but they haven't been dispatched this afternoon. If the train station is bombed, everything will be destroyed!"</p>
<p>Little Shen covered a cold smile on the corner of his mouth with his hand. "Your path is too predictable, and there will be times when you suffer!" he thought to himself.</p>
<p>Fatty Xu was anxious and angry, like an enraged wild bull.</p>
<p>Lan seemed not to see any of their actions. Now, her face was even paler, her eyes were a bit fixed, staring at the entrance of the cave without blinking for a moment, but her pale red lips were constantly quivering, as if she were talking, but no sound came out.</p>
<p>Again, the sound of five or six large bombs exploding in a string.</p>
<p>"Mom! I'm so scared! Why hasn't elder sister come yet? And the rabbit daddy, you didn't bring him out!" Little Rong's small face turned red, and he frantically grabbed Lan's clothes and kneaded them.</p>
<p>"It's okay, Little Rong!" Lan gently patted him, her voice as if in a dream. "Uncle Zhu went to get your sister, they must have hidden somewhere too..."</p>
<p>"What about rabbit daddy? They will definitely bomb him to death!" Rong said, frowning, his heart so anxious that he wanted to cry.</p>
<p>These words reminded his mother.</p>
<p>"Oh!" She was obviously more anxious, breathing very rapidly, and immediately turned around and hugged Rong tightly. "Your sister must have taken rabbit daddy out to fix that tail! That child is so reckless! What should I call Uncle Zhu to look for? Oops! Terrible! Terrible!"</p>
<p>There was some choking in her voice, but she wasn't crying. Instead, Little Rong, forewarned by an ominous sense, was already clinging to her chest, wailing loudly (To be continued).</p>
