<h3>張羣出席參駐會議報吿軍事外交經濟　對動盪物價正研究管制</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕行政院長張羣，十人日晨應邀出席參政會駐委會議，報吿施政槪况，並答覆詢問，至午始畢。張氏報吿略分軍事，外交，經濟三部份，末並詳研當前物價波動因素，指出投機商人破壤國家法令，不守法之情形，並報吿政院，全經會頃正就物偎動盪之癥結，研討管制辦法，就辦法機構之缺點予以改善，人事予以調整，期收治標之效。張氏報吿纂詳，茲略誌於后：</p>
<p>張氏首先對於當前國際局勢之演變日趨複雜及國內局勢之不安定，表示千頭萬緒，實不易詳述，旋分軍事，外交，經濟三點報吿如次：</p>
<p>收復東北安定華北爲國家存亡所必爭</p>
<p>軍事軍人待遇調整後，目前已較八月前增加三倍，雖增國庫負担，但際此戡亂剿匪時會，生活不安定，實應有此合理調整，而此種調整，實為廿年來之首創。其次為剿匪軍事，共匪頃大規模準備發動其第六次攻勢，中共在東北之兵力，尙滲有多數韓共蒙共·日共之部隊達十九萬人，共匪在東北之總額，約四十八萬至五十萬之間，韓共等部隊即佔三分之一，此點足使吾人密切注意。又自匪軍於上月下句發動進攻後，晋西軍事我相當吃虧北寗路一錢曾被迫撤退，當時情勢甚為嚴重，幸由關內調幾個軍前往增援，始得轉危為安，現已無危險。張氏復檢討市東北軍事情形稱:目前戰果即收復區之面積，已較本年五月份時為小，目前收復區面積僅佔東北全面積百分之九·二，人口佔東北全人口百分之三八。九，可耕地佔東北全面積百分之三二，生產力之恢復者佔百分之二七。人多地少，在經濟觀點上說，當不易恢復，經濟危機尤大。吾人對共匪東北方面之攻勢，早已料及，故在機構及人事兩點上均有調整，同時首先結束山東軍事，以相當之力量轉援東北，惟共匪採取紊制辦法，以陳毅等部隊竄擾於鄂。皖。蘇三省，即此目的。張氏稱：吾人不僅要收復東北，且需安定華北，此為我國家存亡必爭之點，故今日軍事重點化東北。旋張氏報吿組織地方民衆貝衛武力之意義及政院通過並經公布之該項辦法之內容。</p>
<h3>我願日本和平自新　琉球羣島須收回　有關韓國問題尙僵持中</h3>
<p>外交　略分一，我對聯合國大會之態度，二，我對日和約態度，茲分述如次：</p>
<p>我對聯大態度：此次聯大意義重要，故王外長親自出席，我代表團出席該會，始終採取獨立自主之立場，聯大提出簨我有關之間題為「否決權之使用」，中國提出之修正案，即有條件之使用，在和平解決國際紛爭部份，應放棄否決權，此次提案美未正式表示意見，現已規入政治安全小組會研究。又美建議在否決權修正前，大會閉幕後之時期中，應設五十七當理會代表大會執行任務，蘇認為有違聯合國基本原則，表示反對，英亦表示冷淡，現尙末獲　減結果。</p>
<p>其次，韓國問題，我主張中，美。英。蘇四國會商，惟蘇拒絕，並稱：照莫斯科大會決議，應由英。美。蘇三國決定，惟以中韓關係密切，故現此事尙在僵持中。</p>
<p>荷印問題，關係我僑民安危，我贊同由安理會進行調查。</p>
<p>我對日和約態度：吾人之原則為「我們願看日本和平自新，但不要使日本作為和平之威脅，不採取報復主義，但不放棄賠償，該條約中包括數項間題:A領土，即琉球羣島，我主張必收回，B賠償，此次戰事，我損失甚鉅，約五百餘億，死亡達千萬人以上，而所接收之日產僅九億美元而已，日首批賠償物資中，吾人可獲四十萬噸，現正交涉中，至現金之分配，關於在中國之日本資產，現仍商洽中，朱作最後決定。C和約起草程序問題，我國務會已決定首先由四國初步會商，再交關係各國討論。其次，對商訂簽約，不得涉及否決權之之使用等，D管制問題，對其侵略思想應否管制，中國對此問題之基本原則為寬大。</p>
<h3>匪擾與投機　造成物價波動</h3>
<p>經濟　政院前後公布兩項辦法，一治本，一治標，治標者即經濟緊急措施方案，治本者為經濟改革万案，旋張氏就必當前物價波動影響經濟秩序之安定，張氏分析物價波動因素，一為軍事使生活不安定，共匪到處竄擾，糧棉均受影饗，一為投機商人藉口操縱市塲之使然。就最近言，其足為藉口之事例，一為監院發表外匯使用報吿書，此項報吿書在說明使用情形，並未載明收入情形，商人認爲國家外匯已使用吿罄，致造成恐慌，投機現象，金鈔市場遂揚起漲風，黑市猖獗，實不值一笑。其次為自備外匯到埠物資之處理問題，當尙未通過時，即有謠傳稱係可以解凍，致進口商到處收買黑市外匯，以為領取到埠物資之市，以至進而至於釀成漲風，全經委會曾特別派員赴滬調查，現仍續作調查，吾人認為因素甚多，如談大票之發行，即定以剌激物價，現經委會正研討一管制辦法，進備於短期內實施，俾收效果。</p>
<h3>張院長答詢</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕參政員武肇煦，余楠秋，鄭揆一等，於張羣報吿後，提出出質詢。武提出當局對物價旣不派員調查，查出之後，即應從嚴懲辦，亂世應用重典。余則認為政府若千措施不免捨本逐末，例如禁舞問題，不先謀舞女之出路，遽言禁舞，不免走向舞業黑市之途，如此下去，則禁舞問題可能造成上海攤販事件之重演。又稱：公敎人員待遇之調整，亦復如是，加成並非善策。旋復有人詢以我外交熊度及生產貸款等項，張即綜合答復：　公敎人員待遇調整辦法，將來仍採取立法院建議，採生活指數辦法發給，其辦法由國府主計處主持，組委會專司辦理。　我外交態度在希望求得世界和平，過去簽訂中，蘇友好條約，即為此，我不願捲入世界爭逐之漩渦。　四聯總處之貸款，今後對下列三者，仍續舉辦，甲，日用品生產貸款，乙，出口物資貸款，丙，交通事業貸款。其餘停止舉辦，以免資金流入市塲，形成游資。</p>
<h3>東北工礦危機深重　在火綫下生產漸形萎縮如再遭破壞恐難期復興</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十八日電〕東北工礦刻在火綫下生產，寶巳面臨深重危機，沒大烽火中，雖未吿停工，但生產逐漸萎宿，且一部工　勢將被迫逃難，其量大困難:　量大不足，如媒礦無法排水，以致流損。　交通斷絕，材料無來源，產品無出路。　員工情緒不安，生產效力甚低。劇某礦負責人淡：如短期東北不獲安定，工礦必遭致命打擊，設不幸再遭破裂，則殘存之工業基礎，難望復興矣。</p>
<h3>王外長明日離美　魏使報告美報認不宜保持秘密　決定對華政策愈妙</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十七日彎〕王外一長定廿日離此返國，渠於歸國途中將於東京稍停，以與來麥帥及商震將軍交換意見。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十七日電〕斯克利浦斯，霍華德系報紙社論稱：「吾人認爲魏德邁報吿隱瞞不加發表歷一月以上，毫無理由。無疑，魏德邁曾提供某項不宜公開之機密策略。資料與評論，果屬如此，則此舉尙屬可諒解。但此並不能作為將普通報吿保持秘密之藉口，吾人深悉杜魯門及馬歇爾事務繁忙，惟中國問題之緊急，實無出其右者。由於美國騎牆觀望，莫斯科及中共正利用此而着進展，故華府之公布堅決對華政策及根據此項政策而行動，愈速愈妙」。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十八日電〕先驅論壇報評魏德邁之報告稱:「魏氏之報吿至今嚴守秘密，蓋美國之對華新政策，至今仍舉棋不定也：美國之所以進退維谷者，由於：如以千百萬金元注入中國以中飽私　或白百浪費實為荒謬之甚者，然目前如視共黨在中國取得勝利，亦爲同樣之荒謬」。</p>

<p>美國　駐法　大使備立　氏，最近在「生活雜誌」上發表一瀉洋　　　的「訪華觀感」，分析中國目前的局勢，極為群盡。一方　求　　政府從連援助中國，另一方則　　中國政府實行十八項的改革，並且主張由杜會門總統派遣麥克阿瑟元帥來華，訂立共同計劃，以防止蘇聯征報中國。此文披　後，引起中　朝　　的注意，和各方的評論。不管我們是否完全同意蒲氏的結論，他對中國局勢說緻的觀察，深切的認識，和洋溢於字裹行間的對華友誼，是值得我們稱讚的。不過澝氏文中對美國近年來與論之轉變，和美國人民對中國之誤解，影饗到中美關係這一點，幾乎完全沒有叙述。美國是一個民主國家，與論對政府政策的決定，是很有影響的。听以我應申報之請，做這篇論文，以中國人的立場，對當前中美關係做一個檢討，一方面供關心中美邦交的人士的參考，一方面也希　就正於澝氏和美國友人。</p>
<p>我自本年二月初到八月底，在美國居留了將近七個月。自大西洋岸到太平洋岸，游歷了二十幾個大大小小的都市，參觀了許多著名的大學·報館·工廠·和學術團體。我因為要明瞭美國社會各階層的意見，所以除了訪問政府人員，國會踐員，大學校長·敎授，報館主筆，科學家，文學家，工會領袖，實業鉅子外，一有機會便和報館訪員，大學學生，商店店員，工廠工人，餐館侍者，汽車司機，家庭主婦，以及飛機火車上同行的乘客等談話，問問他們對美國對中國對整個世界的看法。和我談過話的入，約計總在五千人左右。和這麼多人談話的結果，我得到一個結論，就是美國一般人民（The　Man　in　the　Street）對中國的認識異常不正確。在他們心目中，目前的中國是充滿了紊亂和黑暗。他們不了解何以大戰結東已經兩年，各國均逐漸走上和平安定的道路，而中國內部還不斷的發生戰事。他們認中國是一個謎，是一個不可思議的國家，和美國簡直是隔了一個世界。報紙雜誌上面，則經常可以看見批評和責備中國的論關。他們認為政府無能，官吏貪汚，經濟已到了崩潰的邊緣，人民的苦滿達到水深火熱的程度；總括一句話，他們對中國變於絕望，認為儘管經過八年抗戰的鍛煉，中國還是傳統中的中國，老是那一套，永達不會改革和進步的。因此有些入（裴斐敎授Nathaicl　Peffe　即為一顯明之例），就主張對華取放手政策（Hands　off　policy），不再借款給中國，讓中國自己攪去。</p>
<p>尤其奇怪的是：美國人民絕大多數—可以　百分之九十五以上—是反對共產主義的，是主張以種種力量來制止共產主義的發展的，所以對歐洲受共產主義威脅的國家，不惜要用大量金錢去接濟。美國國會內有反美行動委員會（Un-AmericanActivities　Committee），聯邦政府有調查局（Federal　Burean　of　Investigation），專門注意和偵察共黨的行動；聯邦公務員中發現有共黨份子時，立即予以免職的處分，近幾月來因共黨關係而被免職的公務員，已有幾十人之多。但是對中共，他們就拿另外一種眼光來看。他們以為中共與其他各國的共產黨不問，是一種溫和的農村改良派，主張土地改革而不主張暴動與殘殺；中共和蘇聯，和世界共產主義，是沒右關係的。甚至於他們認中共是民主式的政黨，主張言論自由，思想自由，出版自由，而國民黨則是獨裁式的政黨，反對一切自由。因此，他們有些人竟然相信在中共佔領區的人民較中國政府區城的人民為「幸福」。他們將袒護中共的人稱為進步份子，自由份子，而對反共的中國人，則加上頑固份十，反對份子的頭銜，幾乎完全與中共在國內所宣傳的一樣。</p>
<p>六年前，在珍珠港事變以後，美國與論對中國　是恭維得無以復加。試舉一二個例子：一九四三年七月八日紐約泰晤士報的社論講:「全世界對中國負得有價，因為中國單獨受痛苦，而我們得到益處，現在雖是已遲，但此種債務應該償淸。」惠斯雷安大學校長麥康諾伊（Janes　L.McConaughy）在一九四二年七月間就任援華總會會畏時的致辭，講得更明白。他說：「自一九三七年中日戰事開始起，到珍珠港事變止·美國生存於偕來的時問。我們對中國負債，因為這些年的率竊是中國給我們的。我們將氷不能報償！在這些年中　我們的都市，我們的家處，我們的兒女都保全了，而中國却無情的被敗　了！」拿當時這些話，和今天的英國的興論一比，那簡單是一百八十度的轉變。</p>
<p>造成這個轉變的因素在那裹呢？常然，勝利以後，我們不爭氣，在政洽經濟各方面都暴露了許多缺點，以致使同情中團的友邦人士失望，這是無庸諱言的。但是，除了道一點外，使得美國對　觀感改變的，有下列幾種因素：</p>
<p>第一是共產黨和問路人在美國多年來不斷的宣傳。共產黨是一種極　密的國際組織，全世界的共產黨員都員莫斯科的命令，所以他們對外行動是不分國別，完全一致的。中共反對政府，自然美共也反對中國的政府。中共詆毀政府是獨裁，是專制，是反民主，自然美共也拿這一套頭銜加在中國政府顯上了。因為美國政府根本反對共產主義，所以共產黨的出版物銷路都很少，美共攻擊中國政府所發生的影響也不很大。但是共產黨的同路人就不然了。他們表面上是無黨派色彩的自由主議者，而實際上却在替共然作宣傳不作，如同斯諾（Edgar　Snow）林德賽（Michael　Lindsey）他們的著作，演講，和廣播，都發生很大的作用。尤其與中國有關的學術文化團體，也有共產黨或同路人滲入，他們以遠東問題專家的資格，來發表對中國的意見，一般民衆很容易無辨別的接受，造成了對中國政府和中共的誤解。</p>
<p>第二是戰時美國駐華記者的報導。這些記者抗戰期中住在中國的後方，一切生活的舒適，不但遠不及美國，並且趕不上香港上海，當然感覺到苦痛。加上戰時中國施行嚴格新聞檢查，外國記者飽受種種不便，因此一回到本國，大都發表不滿中國的言論。最顯著的例子，就是懷特（Theodore　White）。懷特擔任生活雜誌駐華通訊員的時侯，也曾寫過忠實的報導，蔣主席也曾眞誠的讀過，（見一九四四年五月一日生活雜誌）；但是他今年出版的「中國之雷聲」，却完全歪曲事實，充滿了誇張，處偽，和似是而非的描寫，對中國政府僅量攻擊，對蔣生席也加以種種誣蠛，而對中共則極力稱許。他甚至說：「曾游歴中共區城領土內的人們，是由國民黨壓迫下逃進了光明區域」，他這本書因為文筆生動，用故事的體裁來描寫抗戰前後的事蹟，所以很受美國人歡迎，銷行幾十萬份。懷特本人名利雙收，但是中美兩民族的友誼却受了一個很大的打擊。</p>
<p>第三是羅斯福德統時代有許多「美共」和同路人滲入了美國政府的各部門，包括國務院在內。這些政府秘吏就利用他們的地位，來做祖護中共的工作。譬如說，有利中國的報告就擱　起來，不向長官星送，也不公開。不利於中國政府的邦告，則僅　護牠洩漏出去。只這一點，對於中國影鄉巳經很大了。國務院前任遠東司司長范宣德，是主管對筆外交的人，他對於中國問題就很有偏見。常常批評中國政府，而袒議共黨。今年二月底，他竟在紐約一個商人團體宴會席上，當着中國官更之面，攻擊中國政府。</p>
<p>第四是美國在華軍官和士兵帶回去的印象。在抗戰末期，美國在中國後方，昆明，成都，重慶，桂林等處的陸空軍軍官和士兵，數以萬計。他們都是抱了滿腔熟血來和中國軍人並肩作戰，或擔任訓練中國隊伍的。但是他們一到中國就不免失望。因為艦管我們竭誠招待，但是受物質條件的限制，他們的生活當然遠不及在美國時的舒適，尤其在內地旅行時，中國小市鎭和鄉村人民生活水準之低，使他們為之驚訝他們在中國做起事來也自然趕不上在美國那種迅速便利。一九四四年湘桂路上大撤退時，又使他們感覺到中國一切事情的混亂。因此種原因，他們返國復員，帶回去的感想，不好的居多，好的居少。他們沒有組織，也不含任何政治意味，只是天價地將他們韶華的印象，說給親戚朋友聽。但是因為這些退伍軍人分佈在全國各地，所以影嚮就相當大。我曾過見好此　國人，他們從沒有到過中國，也沒有讀過有關中國的書　，但對中國政府會有了不好的感想，追究一下，就知通是由美國退伍軍人那方面　來的。</p>
<p>第五是在美國的中國人自己的言論。紐約有中共所辦的「華僑日報」，經常作破壞國民黨和政府的信譽的宣傳。留學生當中也很有為中共張目的份子。我在波士頓看見一本留學生團　所出的英文雜誌，其中有幾　攻來政府的言論，絕不下於美國報紙雜誌的記戰。最奇的，有些到美國去考察的高級官史，拿了政府給予的大量外匯出國，而到了美國却大肆其反政府的宣傳。在美國大學的中國敎授，也有極端評　政府的人。例如今年四月初，普林斯頓大學舉行二百週年紀念，附帶的舉行中國藝術展覽和中國問題演講會，請了許多美國左傾的中國通和中國敎授去講演。第二天紐約報紙登載一段消息，說是昨天中國問題演講會中，大家以為奇怪的，是攻擊中國政府最厲害的，不是美國人，而是在華盛頓大學遠東學院敎書的中國某敎授。過了幾天，我到普林斯頓參觀，當地的留學生將那天各人演稿給我看，這位敎授攻擊政府貪汚，腐敗，和壓迫人民，窮形極相，比左傾的中國通所講的，超過了數倍。</p>
<p>以上五種因素，造面了今日美國人民隊華的不良感想。其中最主要的當然是共產黨有計劃的宣傳，並且除了第四項因棄外，其他第二，三，五項也和共黨和同路人有直接或間接關係。共黨何以如此做呢？因為將整個中國放在共產主義統治之下，是共產黨世界革命中重要的步驟。這個計劃所以至今還沒有實現，一方面是國民黨領導人民堅決的反共，另一方面美國的力量在支持中國政府抵抗共產主義的侵略。因此，中共在國內儘量的破壞搗亂，企圖顯覆政府，而美共則　　宣傳中國之弱點，經　中國政府，使美國對華失去同情，陷中國於孤立，以便利中共的搞亂。</p>
<p>共產黨這種難間中美人民情感的工作，不僅在美國做，並且同樣地在中國做。他們在美國暴露中國的弱點，構中國政府如何貪汚，腐敗，無能，歪曲事實，作　偽誇大的宣傳，而在中國則相反的，儘量宣傳美軍暴行，和美國如何干涉中國內政，引起中國人民對美國的反感，然後又返轉身來，利用這些事　，向美國人去　中國現在反美空氣如何如何的　厚，美國人何必再去援助中國。（今年二月美國醫葉援華會執行秘書斯蒂芬蓀女士Miss　Stevenson　親自吿訴我他覺得中國現在有反美運動頗感遺憾，經我說明這是共黨的陰謀，她才恍然。）中美人民的感情一天一天的疏遠，共產黨就在旁邊竊笑：「你們這羣　瓜，都上了我的當，還不知道。」</p>
<p>所以美國的報紙雜誌　籍　張中國的缺點，無情的攻擊中國，（當然也有主張正義，為中國購公道話的，不過那是少數，）使得我們精神上異常煩惱，認為這是中美友誼上極不幸的現象，但是我們却要沉着忍耐，萬不可意氣用事，來一個反攻，不自覺的走進了共產黨布置的圈套。我認為我們對美國興論應有下列幾點看法：</p>
<p>第一，任何國家的報紙都喜歡煊染，喜歡誇大，喜歡登戰有刺激性的新聞（Sensational　News），而美國的報紙則更甚。所以他們講好講壞都容易過火，容易走極端，不僅對中國如此，對其他國家和本國消息也是如此。我們知道了這種情形，對美國與論的褒貶就可以看淡一點，不必太重視。在珍珠港事變以後美國與論熟烈地頌揚我們，我們實在有點「受之有愧」，不應因之而喜；今天美國興論擺到另外一個極端，無情地批評我們，我們鍳於往事，也不必因之而憤怒。</p>
<p>第二，美國的民族性是坦白的，直率的，有時直率到近於粗魯，與英國民族性之含蓄深沉，恰正相反。美國報紙對一個人或一件事的報導，常常赤裸裸地絲毫不加掩飾。美國人和大談話，那怕是初見面，也可以毫無顧忌的問你許多問題，使得你受窘，但是他們實在並沒有任何的惡意。所以美國與論的批評，攻擊，責備中國，除了共產黨和同路人是別有用心者外，其他的人，我們只好說他們是誤會，粗魯，却不必認他們已經走上了排華或反華的道路。</p>
<p>第三，美國報紙講話是隨便慣了的。他們不僅批評外國政府，對本國政符也是同樣的不韶情地批評和攻擎。例如：羅斯　總統在日，有此報紙雜誌就　他是獨裁，　他們新政是極　主義的作風。那此一寫文章的人何嘗不知道　斯福決不想獨裁，新政和　　主　相距萬里，但是　　話的痛快，不知不覺問就，受本　本市報紙的攻擊，更是常事。我們如果看反對黨所用來攻，紐約·芝加哥·費勒總費亚，或金山市長所用的字句，一　　　覺到這些都市，幾乎是全世界最　　最腐敗的地方！</p>
<p>第四，美國輿論對中國無情的攻擊，當然使得我們難堪，　德　將軍以訪華特使資格，公開教訓中國一頓，在外交禮節上講，尤其是失禮；但是我們如果將感情成份去掉，平心解氣的想一想，就不能不承認美國所指摘的有一部份也是事實。我們本身的確有許多缺點，因為我們不必看美國報紙，就是看中國報紙，又何　不是連竊累讀，檢舉官吏的貪污和衙署的無能呢？所以美國輿論攻擊我們的話，講得過火的，我們可以付諸一笑；惡意　蠛的，我們可以用正確的宣傳方法向美國人民解釋；但是講得中肯的，却值得我們警惕反雀，用來作我們改革政治經濟的參考。如果因此而中國的內政能够一天一天的淸明起來，那末美國的與論，就成了我們的他山之石，我們反受了益處了。</p>
<p>綜合起來講我們決不可以讓美國輿論暫時對我的逆轉，影響到中美兩國傳統的寶貴友誼。這種友誼，是值得我們極端珍視的　因為在世界各強國當中，（包括第一二次大戰戰敗國），美國是唯一沒有用武力割據我們的領土和屬國，沒有要求租借地和勢力範圍的國家。自從十九世紀海約翰宣布中國門戶開放政策以來，美國在許多國際會議中，都會仗義執言，帮中國講了許多公道話。抗戰期中，美國以租借物資接濟我們，（雖然數目較之援英援蘇的少得多，但是這是因為中國海岸綫受封鎖，物資無法輸入的緣故，所以直到抗戰勝利，還有許多物資在印度沒有起運）；以美式器械裝配我國軍隊；派陸空軍人員訓練我國軍隊；借黃金來穩定我國的法幣；美國許多人節衣縮食來救濟我國的難民；日本投降援美國在華空軍大量空運我國部隊，到京滬平津去接收，聯總用在中國黨後救濟事業上的六七憶美金，其中百分之七十是美國所出。凡此種種，均可證明美國誠意地援助中國，值得我們深深感謝。常然，羅斯福之簽訂雅爾達密約，是對不起中國的寫情，也是美國外交史上一個汚點。但是當時羅氏身體已經很衰弱，經不起史太林的壓迫，就貿然讓步，到現在許多美國人也異常不滿，這件事我們不必歸咎於整個美國。最近一年來，美國政府有些事使得我們失望，美國興論的指摘使得我們難堪，但是我們不可一時的　齬，而抹殺過去人家對我們的好意。這決不是大國民應有的風度，也不合乎中國「以德報德」的古訓。</p>
<p>當然我們也誠懇地希望，美國的輿論界也要也要珍重中國對美的友誼，　管中國還是一個貧弱的國家，國際上對美不能有多大幫助，但是四億五千萬人經過五十年歷史養成功的友誼，輕易地失掉，也實在是一件可惜的事體。所以我們希望美國新聞記者和各種作家，不要逞一時筆鋒的痛快，而不必要地刺激中國人的情感；尤其不可漫不加察，無意中作了共產黨的宣傳工具。此外，還有一點可以為中美民族友誼的絆脚石的，就是美國人的種族優越感。許多美國人（當然不是全體﹞總覺得白種人是天之驕子，黃種人是不能相提並輸的。所以在美國有一種矛盾的現象，就是在政治上，外交上，美國人是常常帮助中國的，但是在社交上，在日常接觸上，美國人往往有意無意顯露出瞧不起中國人的心理。僅管現在比戰前巴經好得多，但是有時還會使中國人感覺難堪。到中國來的美國人此稱情形更甚。正如浦氏所說:「很多美國人僅有短期的有限的權力到中國來，而他們把美國的權勢，威武，力量，和統治，跟他們本身的人格，混合在一起，瞧不起與他們接觸的中國人，而這些中國人以人的立塲論，是在他們之上。」又如紐約先鋒論壇報批評美國在　的商人說：「他們傲然與衆不同，從不與中國人維　親密友善的往來。……他們鄙視中國倫理與實際，並為自己不遭受　些約賴而慶幸」。美國人民這種心理，如果不澈底改，中美兩民族友誼上多多少少會留下一點陰影，實在是值的事。（下接第三版）</p>

<p>﹝中央社成功湖十七日電〕美國今日向聯合國秘　處提出世人所久待之有關朝鮮獨立之計劃，主張明年三月卅一日朝鮮應舉行自由選舉，成立朝鮮國民政府，及早日撒退一切佔領軍。美國之建議又主張聯合國設立朝鮮臨時委會，以觀察朝鮮之選舉，及供組織朝鮮國民政府之諮詢。美國更主張或訂立美軍退出朝鮮之協定，臨時委會並有權就聯合國維護朝鮮獨立方面之行動，向聯大提出報吿及建議。</p>
<p>〔中央社成功湖十七日電〕美出席聯大代表杜勒斯，今於記者招待會中稱，美國所提關於朝鮮之建議案，係以早日使朝鮮　其應得之獨立與自由為目的。渠稱，美國已決定刪除一九四五年十二月中美蘇英四國莫斯科協定所規定之託管朝鮮一節。渠繼稱，美以朝鮮問題提交聯大之目的，係擬借重此世界組織之道義力量，以打破過去二年來美蘇間關於朝鮮之僵持局面。杜氏於提及蘇聯建議美蘇同時自轉撤兵時稱，蘇聯之建議與目前美國之建議，有一項重大歧異，明言之，即美國希望先成立朝鮮國民政府，然後撤兵，而蘇雄議案之主張則反是。渠繼稱，南韓僅有美軍四萬五千人，而北韓蘇軍人數則為九萬人，並另有蘇聯裝備之韓軍十二萬人。渠並云，南韓居民共三千禺人，北韓僅一千萬人，日後之選舉，應採比例代表制。杜氏續云，在目前情况下，美國之計劃實為解決朝鮮問題之最佳辦法。渠最後稱，美政府於將其計劃提交大會前，曾與中英兩國政府諮商，並謂擬議中之聯合國朝鮮臨時委會，將由十至十二國組成。盡量在朝鮮多作視察，務使世界興論注意並督促朝鮮選舉。</p>

<h3>美國機器　將中止運往蘇聯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊﹞舊金山十八日廣播:美官方透露，美蘇關係現巳臨攤牌階段。美經濟官員預料美方將中止以機器運往蘇聯，俾將更多之物資輸至實行馬歇爾計劃之歐洲國家。此中主要原因有二:　蘇聯拒絕與馬歇爾計劃合作；　美國內機器生產不多，不敷供應所有需求之國家。此外，蘇聯拒絕說明其購買機器之用途，亦為美方中止以機器輸至蘇聯之原因。蘇聯不能自美蘇得機器，將使蘇聯之五年建設計劃，大受挫折。目前美國對蘇輸出巳大减，一九四六年上半年美國輸蘇之物資（包括租借物資）共值二億二千三百萬美元，今年上半年已减至九千一百萬元。</p>
<p>中美關係的澈底檢討（上文接第二版·程天放）</p>
<p>有些人說，美國之所以援助中國，是為了本身的利益。更有人講，美國要帮助中國，成為一個繁榮的國家，其目的是在使中國變為美國的市塲，推銷美國的貨物。誠然世界上任何一個國家的外交政策，都是從本國的立塲為出發點，決沒有不顧本國的利益而專替他人打算的國家。試問我們中國的外交政策，豈非也是以中國的立塲為出發點嗎？美國一向認定一個强大繁榮的中國，可以成為遠東的安定力，可以有裨於世界和平，也就是美國之利，她的援助中國就從這個立塲出發。這種政策和中國的利害究全一致，中美傳統的友誼，就是建立在這個共同的認識上面的。如果說這是美國的自私也就可以說是中國的自私，但是還種自私是「開明的自私」（Enlightend　Selfishness），因為於己有益，而與人亦有益，正是國際合作的礎石。較之野心國家想拿中國作他的勢力範團，或者支持中國的內亂，以達到他的侵略目的，那種自私政策，眞是不可同日而語。中國繁榮起來，人民購買力增加，美國貨物的銷路可以大大擴充，這於美國自然是有利的事情；但同時中國生產也可以增加，人民生活水準也可以提高，只要中國保特關稅自主的權利，斷沒有國際貿易發展，會對於中國反有害的。</p>
<p>又有些人認為中國近年來的外交，売全跟了美國走，是做了美國的尾巴，喪失中國獨立自主的地位。這種看法顯然是受了共產黨宣傳的影響，是很錯誤的。誠然在許多國際會議中，美國的主張常常得對中國的支持，對於某些國際問題，中美兩國也常常採取同樣的行動。但這是中美兩國利害相同，國策一致的結果，不能說誰是誰的尾巴。譬如設，中英美三國在珍珠港事變以後，曾共同對日作戰，這是站在維護和平抵抗侵略的共同立塲，旣不能說英美做了中國的尾巴，也不能說中國做了英美的尾巴。又譬如在開羅會議中，羅斯福總統主張公道，堅持東北各省，台灣，澎湖，應歸還中國，與中國主張完全一致，我們也能說這是美國做了巾國的尾巴嗎？况且中國的外交政策，也非事事與美國一致的。譬如對日和會問題，因為我們所受日本使略之痛苦，遠在美國所受之上，所以我們對日民族的認識，也較一般美國人為深刻，因此中國對日問題的看法，就和美國不同，中國所提的主張也和美國有出入。這件事可以說明，中國並非放棄本國的立塲，處處跟着美國人走；同時也可以說明，在其他問題上，中美兩國常常一致，中國決不是做了美國的尾巴，也決不因此影饗中國獨立自主的地位。如其說不管美國的主張如何，我們一定要持異議，然後才可以顯出中國蜀立自主的作風，那末听謂國際合作永遠不可能，「聯合國」也就非瓦解不可了。</p>
<p>最近國內强調自力更生，因此，就有人懷疑此後我們是否還應該向美國要求援助，或接受美國的援助。自力更生顯然是正確的南針，但是自力更生與接受外國援助並非衝突的事。中國現在正這遇着嚴　的內憂外患，政治經濟社會各方面都潛伏着極大的危機，假如全國人民不能淬礪奮發，拿艱苦卓絕的精神來克服困難，而專依賴外援，那末中國必然走上崩潰　　的道路；這就是我們所以要提倡自力更生的道理。但是反過來講，因為要自力更生，我們就須謝絕外援，那便是「因噎廢食」了。我們試以英國為例：十九世紀末葉，英國是全世界最富的國家，倫敦是世界金融的中心。經過第一次世界大戰，地位漸漸動搖　這二次大戰，英國更是受了嚴重的打擊，國富大大降低，外匯幾乎用罄。去年春天向美國借了卅七億五千萬美金的鉅款，才算勉强渡過難關。但是當時準備維持四年的，那曉得自去年七月開始動用，到今年八月底，就用去了三十三億五千萬美金只賸下四億了。因此八月初阿特里首相宣佈緊急辦法，要人民更加節約消費，增加生產，同時對各種物品的輸入，大大限制。這就是英國的自力更生。但是英國却並沒有放棄向美國再借鉅款的企圖，一方面在整個援歐計劃中，她可以分一杯羹，另一方面還繼續在單獨的接治借款。英國尙且如此需要外援，中國戰前的財力遠不及英國，抗戰期中所受的損害又遠在英國之上，為什麼我們就不需要外援來作我們戰後復興的工作呢？我們是作戰最久犧牲最大的國家，所以我們在道義上有權要求盟邦的援助，美國在道義上也有繼續援助中國的義務。</p>
<p>國父的實業計劃就建立在各國共同努力發展中國富源這個原則上面，只要我們運用外國資本和技術得當，中國的建國工作可以縮短許多年。所以只要是不干涉中國內政，不損害中國主權的偕款和援助，我們應該是儘量歡迎的。（下接第五版）</p>

<p>﹝本報訊﹞法商水電公司供電區域，包括舊法租界全部地區，昨夜九時半忽水電斷絕，頓成黑暗世界，電軍交通亦因此影饗，暫吿停頓，至十時後始陸續恢復，事後據水電公司宣佈，昨夜因引擎兩部忽吿損毀，同時總綫亦被燒斷，以致發生水電斷絕。至引擎損毀原因，經檢查結果，認為或與用電過度有關。常機廠出事之時，據附近居民目擎者談：最初曾見烟囪中　出巨大火光，繼之轟然一聲後，整個法商水電區域，即隨之全部失明。當時伸手不見五指，路上交通行人，無不為之驚慌云。</p>

<h3>主席嘉許經濟警察兪局長晉謁後返滬　曾報吿理工潮物價等經過</h3>
<p>﹝本報訊﹞警察局長俞叔平日前晋京，除向中樞報吿會同社會局處理工潮及平抑物價漲風情形外，並向內政部請示擴充警局編制與人事問題，內以轉業軍官安插問題為主體。且以本市治安力量亟待增强，會向國防部治商增發武器彈藥，並請求增加裝甲軍四十輛，强化本市管衛力量。茲以公畢，業於昨晨早軍返滬，午後在警局接見記者談稱：此次晉京分別謁見蔣主席。張院長·內政部張部長及警察總署唐署長等。十六日晨蒙蔣主席親予召見。蔣主席對滬市情形頗為關切，首先即龜詢上海饗察生活及紀律，有無貪汚舞弊等情。本人即答謂：極大多數警官警士，均能潔身自好，奉公守法。尤以上海現有之警士，一部份為前工部局所遺留者，服務時間已達一二十年，均屬優秀份子，且家屬大部有副業，其收入總和，足使家庭溫飽。另一部份為勝利後招考錄取者，大部為尙未成家之靑年，無家庭負担，故收入雖微，尙足以自給。同時警局對福利事業，推行甚力，現已辦有員警公寓及宿舍，公共食堂。警察子弟學校。員警互助合作社等，故能養成廉潔奉公之風氣。繼詢及本市工潮及物價波動情形，經詳為報吿，大意為：</p>
<p>工潮起因於搜查富通印刷所時發現匪黨名單一批，有美商上海電力公司工人在內。及經逮捕，即發生怠工情形。後經會同社會局處理即吿解決。其時法商電車公司工人忽起嚮應，提出無理要求並實行罷工。當時社會局為維特市區交通，另雇新工在警察保護下繼續行車。孰知擾亂份子，竟於此時煽動工人發生搗毀軍輛情事，致有工人九十六名被捕。其中除獲有搗亂實據者移送法院訊辦外，其餘由公會及公司當局保釋，而工潮旋即平息。蔣主席當指示：「今後應注意擾亂份子，務使不容再留上海」。俞局長又報吿此次本市</p>
<p>物價波動原因，實由於外匯及紡綢會棉紗議價之一再調整。復因工廠受電力限制，出品减少，而生產成本則反見增加，因之造成求渦於供，加以季前性之投機操縱，邃使物似呈空前激漲。旋經吳市長，主持之經檢會報決議，採取嚴峻措置，並出動全體經濟警察監視各市塲後，各物巳普遍下跌。主席聆悉之下，頗表嘉許。當令木人將經濟警察加以充實，並將經濟警察組織辦法呈閱。當時適本市糧商因徵收糧食營業稅推派代表晋京請願，主席關心民食問題繼以此事垂詢，本人當報吿糧食價格上漲，主因為來源不暢，且有一部份工廠學校，有囤米行為，同時自產區運米至消費者，中問手續頗多，即自產地收購至輾米廠，再經運輸商，市塲經紀人，糧食批發商，另售米店而至消費者之手，每担米納稅竟至十萬元，故米價無形中亦因之上漲。主席聆詞後，深為注意，允交糧食，財政兩部重行考慮。至於</p>
<p>金都事件兪氏在京時曾晤國防部秦次長，秦氏稱：此案憲兵部份，業已判決，警察部份，即將解滬由法院審理後，與憲兵部份同時公佈。最後俞氏吿記者稱，渠已計劃擴充經濟警察至一百名，並使之獨立。同時令飭各分局今後一體注意經濟罪犯之檢舉。强華白報紙遭查封</p>

<h3>金焦秋容</h3>
<p>﹝本報鎭江十七日訊﹞蘇北殘匪，近為策應竄擾蘇皖邊區之劉伯承匪部，曾於九月杪，分股在淮海緩靖區轄境之阜寗，鹽城，實應。興化，曁第一緩靖區轄境之泰興，泰縣，靖江各縣，乘機蠢動，鑒城守軍為爭取主動，待機打擊共匪，乃於本月初，撒出縣城城內各機關及公務員，隨軍退入東台，興化，泰縣三縣境內者，數逐四萬餘人。此中難民，大多貧苦，逃出家鄉，衣食住行，均成問題，轉徙流離，痛定思痛。甚盼政府懲前毖後，迅籌有效辦法，調遺大軍，肅濟蘇北殘匪，並澈底摧毀共匪在蘇北各縣之地方組織，以安民生，聞蔣主席對蘇北人民極表軫念，今年秋冬之交，可能來鎭巡視。</p>
<p>興化來人談:增援該縣之國軍劉部某旅，一部巳開入縣境，政府轄區，城鄉人心漸安，惟因難民湧至，物價高昂，人民生活，頗感不易，故近日結伴出境至京滬謀生者，為數甚衆，聞常局鑒於興化四境皆水，港沒紛歧，水上防務，極為重要，加之興鑒接壤，地勢複雜，即擬加派新型小砲艇多艘，駛往該縣協助國軍，强固水上治安。又該縣縣長卜鎭海，上週曾偕同高郵縣長張冠球，至淮陰，向張雪中將軍獻旗致敬，張雪中對該縣治安，埀詢甚詳。</p>

<p>秋收以後，農民竟多啼飢號寒之聲，其苦可知。現政院僅撥款三億元，以充救齊堅城，興化，東台，海門，啟東五縣難民之需，就中鹽城分得一億元，其他四縣，各得五千萬元，雖屬杯水車薪，但在國庫奇紬之今日，有此賑款，足微政府關懷蘇北人民之股切。不過蘇北各縣之教育界人土及智識份子，則咸望中樞對於</p>

<p>物價稍廉資爲談助，而哀哀難民，則探怨由京鎭至上海之軍票價目同值，為不當，何不為窮人打算？（路局所訂票價，由南京頭鎭江至上海，同一價目，旅客時有怨言。）</p>
<p>鎭市糧價及一般物價，近來亦波動甚烈，上熟米每石已逾六十萬，燃料及油類，較秋節前均增加一倍有餘，公敎人員及升斗小民，莫不呌苦述天，市民聞官方當此房荒嚴甲，生活困難之際，又將努力拆屋拓路之表面建設，深以為異。</p>

<h3>中美關係的澈底檢討（上接第三版）  程天放</h3>
<p>蒲氏主張美國在三年之內，以十三億五千萬呈于金的款項，貸給中國。其中六億美金為信用貸款，以供中國向美國購買食糧原料機械等之用；一億五千萬美金作為外匯平準基金；六億美金為軍事援華的用途，帮助中國剿平共匪。蒲氏原則，我們很表贊同；只是一億五千萬的外匯平準基金，實在感覺不够。我個人以為中國現在最需要的一件事，就是改革幣制——發行新幣來代替那幾已經到了惡性澎漲程度的法幣。幣制如果不改變，通貨澎漲沒有法子遏止，預算沒有法子平衡，物價不斷上漲，公敎人員生活水還沒有保障，社會經濟也永遠不會安定，一切建設也使無從進行。所以除了剿匪工作之外，目前最緊要的事就在此。但是要發行新幣，必須有充分的外匯準備金，如果沒有準備金，早晨發行新幣，晚上又可以貶值，結果又必走上惡性澎漲的道路。如果有了準備金，新幣可以自由購買外匯，黑市立刻絕跡，物價也就趨於穩定，然後政府才可以談收支平衡，開源節流，財政才可以上軌道，國民經濟才可以安定，可以發展，公敎人員的生活有了合理的解決，行政效能才可以提高，貪汚也才可以肅淸。這筆外匯進備金，究竟需要多少呢？當然是多多益善，但是最少限度，我估計也需要十億美金。這一點是美國援助中國作政治經濟改革的要着，如果不注意這個基本之圖，零星小借款很可能無濟於事。並且這筆借款加上蒲氏所建議的其他兩項借款，一共是二十二億，看起來好像數目很大，但是與去年美國借與英國的款項比較，不到百分之六十；與馬歇爾援歐計劃所需要的款項比較，更是為數甚微了。至於蒲氏所建議的軍事·政治。經濟各項改革，我認為都值得政府的注意和採納。但是美國却不可以這些為借款的交換條件。因為中國政府自動改革是一件事，受外國的干涉來施行改革又是一件事。前者為全國人民所歡迎的，而後者必引起許多人的反感，因為他損害中國民族的自尊心，並且更可使共產黨利用來做離間中美友誼的口實。</p>
<p>蒲氏的主張會不會為美國政府所採用呢？這是許多中國人腦筋中正在那裹思考的問題。照我看，自從馬歇爾返美以後，美國對華態度就在一種矛盾心理之下游移不決。此種矛盾心理不打破，美國對華政策很難十分明朗化的。在抗戰期中，美國政府受了共產黨宣傳的影響，以為中國政府是一黨專政，不够民主；所以一九四五年十二月十五日，杜魯門總統就來了一個對華政策的宣言，聲明中國政府必須擴大基礎，容納共他黨派參加，俟此點完成後，美國始能再作經濟方面的援助。同時，他又派馬歇爾來華，調停政府與中共爭執的任務。馬歇爾之來華，來確抱了滿腔熱誠，希望中國能避免內戰的苦痛，和平統一，因此去年暑天，他冒着炎熱，八上盧山，為政府與中共傳達條件。他手下的美國軍官，也不辭艱險，在火綫上執行調處的任務。但是他當時沒有了解中共整同准翻玫府的企圖，沒有認識要中共放棄武力從事和平政治活動，等於與虎謀皮。結果，馬氏和美軍官們是勞而無功，經過十三個月的努力，終於失敗而去。因為中共沒有加入政府，等於杜魯門宣言中的條件沒有達到，所以這一年半來，美國除救濟物品和轉讓的剩餘物資外，始終沒有在經濟方面援助中國。不但沒有新借款，連己經指定作援助中國用途的五億美金，也凍結在進出口銀行不能動用，到今年六月底就失了時效。</p>
<p>這是一年十個月來美國對華的事實經過，但是另一方面美國政府對共產黨的認識却起了極事大的變化。單事初結束待、，美國政府沿壞着羅斯福遺下來的政策，希望共產國家能與民主國家切實合作。其後觀念逐漸改變，到今天這種希望可以說早已不存在了。馬歇爾在華調停雖失敗，可是有一點收獲，就是認淸了巾共的眞面目，不是溫和的農村改良派。蘇聯在東南歐的各種行動，更使得美政府深切地認識了蘇聯的國策。所以今年三月十二日杜魯門總統在國會演說，要求以三億五千萬美金援助希士，作抵抗共產主義侵略之用（就是所謂社魯門主義），今年六月，馬歇爾史宣佈援助整個歐洲政策（就是所謂馬歇爾計劃）。這兩件事發生，美國有些人（包括國會議員在內）就講：「我們在歐洲盡力抵抗共產主義的發展，而在亞洲却要共產黨加入政府，才肯借款與中國，這豈不是滑稽之至」？杜魯門與馬歇爾雖則對比點沒有發表過意見，我想他倆暗中也一定發笑。所以現在美政府一方面根據牠的整個國策，是必須繼續援助中國政府的，但是另一方面有了杜魯門的聲明，馬歇爾調停的失敗，一時又轉不過來，而且受了共黨宣傳的影響，認為中國不民主，不自由，政治如何腐敗，官吏如何貪汚，又覺得這樣政府，並不值得援助，這就是美國政府的矛盾心理。因為這個心理，再加上美國政府向來是歐洲擺在第一，亞洲擺在第二的，而歐洲問題也非常嚴　，所以中國問題就暫時被忽略。因此十個月來，美政府對華政策的表現，是徘徊歧路，舉棋不定。</p>
<p>但是這種狀况是決不能持久下去的。國際局勢一天一天的緊張，共產主義與民主主義的對峙，因為共產國際的招牌重行掛上，而更加深刻化。美國政府為求世界的和平安定，為貫澈牠的旣定國策，必然的要繼續抗戰時期的援華政策。魏德邁的報吿，到今天還沒有公布，大家認為是一個謎。依我推測，報吿內容必定是主張有條件的援助中國政府。蒲氏這篇文章不一定直接影饗美國政府，但是可以澄清美國人民對中共的認識，和對中國問題的看法，可以促成美國與論來贊助美國政府的積極對華政策。在這一層意義上，蒲氏的文章是很有作用的。（馬歇爾從莫斯科返美後，曾親自吿訴中國某外交官說，美國繼續援華是不成問題，但必須有一種理由，或一種方式，能得到與論的擁護，和國會的同意。）我們處在中國的立塲，所希望的是，美國政府的援助，千萬不要附上使中國不能接受的條件，以致美國的好意成為白費。同時，希望美國政府明瞭東亞局勢的嚴萬，不在歐洲之下，不要因歐洲而忽略亞洲，對中國的援助不可過小，更不可過遲，以致减低或消失了作用。（完）但准征收附加及特種稅</p>

<h3>無許可證進口貨品輸入管理委員會　已擬定處理手續　條文整理後即可發表</h3>
<p>（本報訊）輸出入管理委員會於昨日下午四時起，舉行例會，出席陳啓天，李馥蓀，李榦，楊恒，沈奏庭，黃慶華，張茲　，張福運，方鷓先等，由主委張嘉璈親自主持，討論迄七時三十分，始告散會。會後據該會秘書處長方鵷先談，此次例會，重要議案有三，茲探誌如次：</p>
<p>無許可證到埠及啓運貨品處理手續，大體業已擬就。惟各條文文字，仍待整理，可望於廿日發表。　八月十六日以前已到埠或已啓運之無許可證自備外匯貨品，未及按照公告第二號如期登託者，業經議決，准予補行登託。　輸管曾爲扶植工商，獎勵出口起見，正在商訂輸出品之製造原料輸入辦法。本日（十八日）討論辦法草案，原則通過，詳細條文，應再加修正整理後，呈行政院核定後公佈施行。</p>
<p>至收購自備外匯到埠貨物處理辦法施行細則，尚待該會察酌辦法原意，並兼顧事實需要，另行擬訂，俾處理辦法，得推行盡利。</p>
<p>又本市進出口商業等十六公會所建議該會之意見八點，昨亦經提會交換意見，各出席委員，頗表同情，擬暫時考慮，未作任何決定。</p>
<p>該會昨日本擬將政院公佈之處理辦法登報公告，公告後即辦理進口商登記及申請事宜。後以各項手續，尚未完備，大致將延至二十一日，始能正式公告。至公告詳文，與本報本月十五日第一版所刊無許可證自備外匯到埠及起運貨物處理辦法相同，茲不贅述。</p>
<h3>進出口業公會舉行臨時會議</h3>
<p>（本報訊）本市進出口業公會，於昨日下午舉行臨時會員會議，該會秘書長張耀草，報告昨日（十八日）會晤輪管會張主委李副主委經過，略稱：所提八點建議，輸管會表示大致均允備案考盧。惟　外匯存單抵充四五兩季限額之用，　政府收購後，仍按原收購價，加利潤百分之十，　先售予原進口商兩點，未能貿然接受。各會員旋即開始討論，認爲各轍管會對所提八點建議，全部不能接受時，則各進口商只能準備將原物裝運出國，並擬於二十日起，公會先開始辦理登記，俾便洽定艙位外運云。</p>
<h3>統債續疲外股平庸</h3>
<p>公債昨再疲軟，統丙晨開一五六○○元，高價一五九○○元，低價一五三○○元而後略定。五○三室賣出，五五○室則進。結果較前收計甲乙低三○○元，丙跌五○○元，統戊低二○○元，統丁尚平，成交約二百餘萬。</p>
<p>外股昨尚平庸，業廣獲銀行帮之埀靑，獨告挺升，餘者不過平疲而已。洋商及證券帮有供，廣帮尚扒。怡紗晨開一七九○○○元，低價一七二○○○元，而後站定於一七五○○○元左右。結果較前收計紙業墾植各升半成，業廣漲成半，航業平平，餘者升降均微。</p>
<h3>活動派放棄永紗小型股漲風擴大</h3>
<p>華股昨畸形發展，業中活動派棄水紗而轉向信和進取。兩者之進展，前疲而後悄，背道而馳。小型股中俏利之風擴大，大部份倦極面動，挺進甚多。華新水泥新亞業廠再達漲限，業外人如能參加，股市當可有劃時代之變遷。冷熱股倍數之差額，或可軋攏。</p>
<p>晨開見秀，美亞高起較多，後永紗曾退至即交三二四元，開遞交三三四元。新亞掛高至漲停，華新水泥亦兩次漲停板，曾將永紗拉上至即交三三二元，遞交三四五元。信和漲起更多，達即交一七八元，遞交一八四元。美亞亦升至即交五九五元，遞交六一五元。塲外息價開二角五分半及三角，間有三角以上者，於是棄永紗而進信和之風又起。近午永紗跌至即交三一六元，遞交三二六元。收市爲三一八元及三二九元。信和跌至一六○元及一六七元，回漲近十元結束。美亞亦低後有回。結果較前收即交股計華新漲停後有回，軋漲一成。內衣漲停後有回，軋低少許。國貨好半成，水泥漲一成，新亞漲達限度，五和跌停後有　。中絲恒　平平，永紗閘北微挫，中紡大通景綸麗安勤興信誼　升，新光新華景福華教火柴統益信和榮豐各好半成。遞交股計永紗美亞勤興微升，信和新光景福漲半成，華豐昂一成。塲外各老股除銀行股文化股仍漲，餘尚平定。</p>
<h3>米價續跌油價又漲</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧一萬餘石，交通部又設法加派車輛將南京下關存站秈米二萬包，迅速運申，市况益見呆滯。粳米中下跌三五萬元，秈米再跌三四萬元，自元亦低二三萬元。南路新粳跌五六萬元。麵粉無錫來貸　吒，去化甚細步削五六千元。廠紛亦降二三千元，麩皮膚消不爽，再跌三五千元。豆餅達疲之後，　銷略辦，轉升二三千元。黃豆因油餅俱升，銷路轉活，疲而復振，回高三五千至萬元。莞豆納戶稀少，挫落一二萬元。缸豆消化平常，步削萬餘元。紅稱到源湧塞，供多於求，續疲三五千元。苞米北洋動而不旺，趨勢暫定。芝麻本街拾取，仍居疲途，軋低三五萬元。生仁猛跌之後，廣方乘巧納取，客心轉堅，回漲三五萬元。小麥條削五千元。</p>
<p>油市大跌之後，店胃　　，重見回升，豆油提高十萬元，生油猛升二十萬元，清油堅挺，菜油亦漲六七萬元。麻油略有參差，形勢趨入盤旋。</p>
<h3>紗布買多轉漲</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以述日下瀉不少，津粵客帮逢低吸收，本街染織廠亦有進取，買賣轉呈熱鬧。更因進多出少，市上籌碼不充，行情遂告回昇。結果四二支藍鳳紗做高至三千三百卅萬元，比上日猛升一百三十萬。廿支特雙馬價亦昂至二千四百萬兀有成交，回升一百五十萬元。十六支光明軋好七十萬，其他各支粗細紗，亦均跟揚三四十萬至五六十萬不等。</p>
<h3>棉布</h3>
<p>晨開因傳津漢廣東等地紗價報升，人心頓呈樂觀，客帮採納較暢。更兼買方有動，紡建開布，酊價亦稍提高，染廠亦有進意，本市棉布店號採辦不寂，十二磅龍頭細布交易頗旺，價復昂至八十一萬元</p>
<h3>紗布登記完成</h3>
<p>（本報訊）本市花紗布各關係公會，奉令辦理登記，迄十七日止，已告一段落。據悉：六區棉紡公會登記棉紗四一○○○件，棉布四四八○○○件。紗商業公會登託會員共一三三家棉紗三三八八件。棉布業公會登託會員六二八家，棉布件數未詳。棉花商業公會登記會員七九家，棉花担數未詳。機器染織業公會登記棉紗之會員三一七家，登記棉布之會員三○七家，棉紗布之件數未詳。</p>
<h3>棉紗議價缺乏彈性張總裁囑再加檢討</h3>
<p>（本報訊）中央銀行總裁張嘉璈，於昨日下午六時許，在該行召集國民營紗廠各代表談話，經濟部陳部長亦出席，到王啓宇，榮鴻元，榮爾仁，唐星海，劉靖基，高秉泰等多人，席間對目前棉紗　價制度，缺乏彈性，認爲有再加檢討之必要。又棉花價格騰漲，影響生產成本殊鉅，當討論如何聯合議價收購，以平抑棉價，協助生產云。</p>
<h3>吳市長切囑　繼續抑低紙價　紙號帳冊帳册均已發還</h3>
<p>（本報訊）本市紙商業公會理事長詹沛霖，於昨日下午四時許，往謁吳市長。吳市長對日來白報紙價格飛漲至每令一四○萬元之高價，甚表震怒。詹氏當加解釋，略稱：同業間絕未喊過如此高價，最高價不過喊一二○萬元，惟亦僅係喊價而已，並無成交。正式之長高價爲一○○萬元，公會方面曾因喊價渦高，即停止同業茶會。一方面並緊急公告，着同業白報紙門市價，减低至每令八十五萬元。吳市長聆詞後，當表滿意，並囑繼續抑低紙價，又稱：日昨（十七日）查封之各紙號帳册業已發還，並准許恢復營業云。</p>

<h3>小說雜攷</h3>
<p>— 風人</p>
<h3>封神榜</h3>
<p>「滿紙荒　言，」固然是小說家的本色，但即使如「封社演義」之作，却也並非毫無所本。「舊唐書」禮樂志行六韜云：「武王伐紂，雪深丈餘，五軍二馬，行無轍迹。詣營求謁，武王怪而問焉。太公對日：「此必五方之神來受事耳。」遂以其名召入，各以其職命焉。」案五軍二馬乃四海之神，祝融，句芒，顓頊，蓐收，河伯，風伯，雨師也，又史記封禪書「八神將太公以來作之。」則俗傳不盡誣矣。「歸田瑣記」戴林　亭言：「昔有土人罄家所有，嫁其長女者，次女有怨色，土人慰之曰：「無憂貧也，乃因尙書武成篇「惟爾有神，尙克相予」語，演為封神傳，以稿授女，後其婿梓之，乃大獲利。」考周書克殷篇：「武王遂征四方，凡　國九十有九，　魔億有十萬七千七百七十有九，俘人三億。」魔與人分別言之，雖不知所謂魔者何謂，但亦足以證明小說的依托了。廣成十見「荘十」，赤精子見「漢書」李尋傳，托塔天王見「元史」輿服志。哪叱見「　堅志」。濯口二郎即楊戩。其說皆不為無據。</p>
<h3>隋唐演義</h3>
<p>至如「隋唐演義」，　　帝明皇宮　事甚悉，也都是有所本的。其　土木之功，御女之車，矮民王義及侯夫人自經詩詞，則見有「迷樓記」，其敍楊素密謀，西苑十六院名號，美人名姓，泛舟北海遇陳後主，梅梅玉李開花及司馬戡逼帝，朱貴兒殉節等事，並見於「海山記」，其敍宮中閱廣陵圖，麻叔謀開河食小兒，家中見宋襄公，狄去邪入地穴，皇甫君擎大鼠毀脚，女挽龍舟等事，並見於「開河記」。（三記皆韓　撰）其敍唐宮事，則雜採劉餗「隋唐嘉話」，曹　「梅妃傳」，鄭處誨「明皇雜錄」，柳程「常傳言旨」。鄭　「開天傳信記，」王仁裕「開元天寶遣事，」無名氏「太唐傳載」。李德裕次柳氏舊謂聞，史宮樂史之「太眞外傳」，陳鴻之「長恨歌傳」。復參攷本紀列傳而成之者，可說是無一字無來歷了。</p>
<h3>三國演義</h3>
<p>「三國演義」一書，家喻戶曉。而成。滿澝入關時，曾翻譯為滿文，用作兵書。袁崇煥之死，就是用了蔣幹偷書的計謀，這自然未免有點好笑。然而，舊時代的歷史，原是皇帝的私家記載，倒不如小說傳奇，或許還能反映其眞相於萬一。王漁洋「香祖筆記」中亦云：「故史傳奇，往往存三代之直，反勝穢史由筆者倍蓰，前輩謂村中兒童，聽談三國事，聞昭烈敗則顰蹙，曹操敗則歡喜踊躍，正此謂也。禮失而求之野，惟史亦然。」</p>
<h3>畫如其人</h3>
<p>— 洪為法</p>
<p>這是去年冬天，筆者還在南京工作，其時最能恢復自家工作疲勞的，要算和傳抱石先生飲灌，並且看他作畫了。在飲酒時，他請人飲或是人請他飲，彼此都不較量，各盡其能也共盡其歡。到了酒酣耳然，伸紙作畫，畫到會心處，會不期然而然的一齊拊掌大樂。接着便張求題款，拿去一幅，李求題款，又拿去一幅，他都欣然命筆。也欣然貽贈，原來飲酒作畫，是他性情所近，又是與會所寄。</p>
<p>筆者以為傳先生的畫，可謂「畫如其人」。他豪邁，所以畫中顯露出豪邁之概。他恬淡，所以　中又顯露出恬淡之境。他證書極多，所以盡中更顯露出極濃厚的書卷氣。他是喜歡石濤，又對石濤之畫極有研究的人，而自家之畫，却不必羣學石濤。他的山水有意境，不是僅以亂石疊波來震駭人，他的人物有韵味，也不是僅以容顏裝束來逗引人。</p>
<p>看他的山水，會使人時有山無窮水無盡之想。「只在此山中，雲深不知處」，在他的山水聲上，似乎有不少的可以如此題句，而能够使人足以玩味的，也正因為是這樣吧？看他的人物，又會使人對現實增加悠悠塵俗之感，因為畫中人物太有韵味了。這韵味之解釋，似乎蘿藉兩字還不足以盡之。如是畫中人物也是以容顏裝東來逗引人，將如何能淨化人生？又如何能稱為藝術作品</p>
<p>其實這種情形，都是由於傅先生的品格與學養造成的。筆者偽見，以為在中國以文人盡為最高貴，亦惟眞正文人，才能以　卷之氣驅除了匠氣，成為高貴的書家。我們如以中國文人看待傳先生，並鑒賞其畫，當更易知其作品之高貴吧？</p>
<h3>愛與人生</h3>
<p>— 匡瀛</p>
<h3>愛與憎</h3>
<p>希伯來有這樣一個故事：</p>
<p>從前有一個最討厭「愛情」的國王，他用很新奇的方法處置那些正在戀愛着的男女靑年：兩問空屋分鎖着一隻猛虎和正在戀愛着的女人；而吩咐那男人在一聲口令之後，需在三分鐘內衝入一間屋去決定他的死生。倘使他衝入的是鎖着猛虎這一間，他就被噬死了，否則，他倆由國王做證人結為夫婦；這樣過來不知演成了多少悲喜劇。以後，這國王的獨生女和殿前的騎士戀愛了，自然沒有例外，但臨時國王吝裔起這個獨生女以後會遭逢可怕的命運，允許那騎土掉上一個全國最美麗的女子。於是那騎士企國以後有幸福的家庭而此身不　虎口起見，到夜間去哀求國王的獨生女能臨時指示他一個目標，她答應了，可是她這一夜睡不着，胸中織着矛盾，屆時，那國王的獨生女終於忍心地有意指點錯讓她的戀人去　了虎口。</p>
<p>人類的「憎」始終是緊跟着「愛」不放鬆的，愛之深時亦是恨之切時；可是有一天，到自己知道無法保存他的「愛」時，即使是最關懷的人，也忍心地看他毀滅下去而亳不給予一分珍惜。但，千百年來，又誰曾用互虎之掌，把男女間愛情的虛偽撕下來呢？大家把甜蜜的話溫柔的手段做着幌子在騙人。</p>
<p>愛情終究是嚙傷過許多人的天眞的。我驟然憶起一句話：愛情好似看熱鬧的塲子，裹面的人想擠出來，外面的人想擠淮去。</p>
<h3>魯迅語錄</h3>
<p>— 阿水</p>
<p>我做完之後，還要看兩遍，自己覺得拗口的，就增刪幾個字，一定要牠讀得順口，只有自己懂得或連自己也不懂的生造的字句，是不大用的。（本日為迅翁忌辰，特刋語錄一則，以誌紀念。（　者）</p>
<h3>齊雲岩觀雲海</h3>
<p>— 許士騏</p>
<p>齊雲山距皖南休　縣四十餘里，高二百似，明代建有衣素宮。正中香爐峯，聳峭獨立，遠眺雲海，至為壯觀。（作者附註）</p>
<p>「買先生眞是多才多藝哪。」糧羣並沒忘記對方是個女身，却因它開口閉口都是「鄙人」，所以稱它「先生」，也是迎合心理的意思；况且如今女界稱呼先生，也很普遍。</p>
<p>「哪兒的話，也是　凑合……可是鄙人有個要求；您別稱鄙人光生，承您不棄，要是把鄙人當個朋友的話，呌鄙人「老買」或「小買」都成。鄙人今年三十一，將來咱們成了知己，您要是肯呌一聲「沙哥」，雖說不敢當，可眞稱了心願咧……」說着又是眼睛一乜斜。</p>
<p>耀　聽到最後這一句，才猛然想起了一件事，吃了一驚；雖說仍舊不動聲色，兩隻眼睛却本能地在它身上搜紫起來，尤其注愈它的喉部；看看有沒有喉結。</p>
<p>「您可別諛會，紀小姐……」它早又猜透了耀羣的心意；「鄙人雖說有些江湖上的琉腔流調，還不至於如此下流，男扮女裝來欺騙人家大閨女……可又說不清，鄙人雖說也是女性，可是打從車站看見您，就像中了魘術一樣，簡直……」大槪是說「簡直一見傾心。」</p>
<p>「對不起，買先生，，……我還有一件事，得趕着辦……」說備，便冲着這塊魔料一瞧手表。耀羣感到十二分的窘，因這傢伙的行動言語，過分肉麻。</p>
<p>「　哪！」這傢伙好像夢裹醒轉一樣，一面揉着那雙肉泡眼，一面站了起來：「瞧，我這人是幹什麼來的？……可不是想跟您合作？第一，被獲電台，有七八位中國秘密工作同志，給憲兵部圈了起來，鄙人打算把他們救出來。二，這裹靑年，學生不少，就沒有好好的組織，假如能給他們一種指導，團結起來，力量可眞不小……。」</p>
<p>「啊，有什麼困難嗎？」　羣只能這麼若即若離的問着。</p>
<p>「您知道，要救他們出來不難，鄙人肯負責，担保他們不溜走。可是困難的一點，他們對於鄙人，亳無聯繫，當然不肯聽話。至於學生靑年方面，我們中間亳無淵源，對於鄙人，當然沒有信仰，沒有信仰，如何組織？」</p>
<p>「您打算怎麼辦？」耀羣要把它的話，全擠了出來。</p>
<p>「辦法只有一個——剛才說過，只要您肯合作，問題都可解決。」它的態度，好像十分誠懇，一些也看不出虛偽來。</p>
<p>日本歷史上有如下一段：</p>
<p>有一次，當那個兇暴的雄略皇帝出巡時，在河邊看到一個美麗的洗衣女。他說：「你等着，我要接你宫裏去」。这件事，在那個洗衣女看來是無上幸運的。她天天夜裏做着美夢，甚至笑醒來。可是，一天，又一天，太陽在頭上飛越過，到那個洗衣女的面孔等老得像蠟人般時，她尙每天留在河邊。但，那時的皇帝已忘却了那句諾言。</p>
<p>一個人，睜着長夜失眠的倦眼去等待那虛無不可捉摸的天明，得到的往往是一些美麗的欺騙。人，多憶憬着現實的美境，總比夢魂中的海巿廣樓切實些，因此往往忘了自己眞正的現實人生，待到覺悟過來時，生活的悲痛已像蛇嚙殘了你的心靈。</p>
<p>於是，我得了一個「人生」的詮釋：——</p>
<p>每個人都把生活做成了美麗的圈子，把自己關在這囚籠中，之後，又每個人不耐生活的牢籠，而想　碎他。</p>
<p>這之中，就產生了許多哀愁。</p>
<h3>迎陳樹人先生畫展</h3>
<p>— 徐蔚南</p>
<p>繪畫而能盡技巧的能事的，巳經不易，旣有技巧，而能顯示書家高尙的品格的，自然更屬可貴，而陳樹人先生獨能兼有此二者，眞不愧是當代畫壤第一流的宗師！</p>
<p>陳先生努力作畫己有五十年之久，而他的用心，簡直沒有一天移開過繪畫，而心胸廣闊，眼界高遠，故能對於中外畫理，兼收並蓄，融會貫通。當然他的作品，從技巧方面而論，構圖設色以及用筆，都已達到了圓滿的境地。但更其可貴的，就是人人所欽敬的陳先生本人的淸風亮節，也能於書面一一透露無遺。他的作品不僅以優美的綫條或者鮮姘的色彩悅目，而更有一種艷塵而高潔，雄壯而恬靜，秀雅而端莊的感情迸裂出來的，譬如猗猗的綠竹，在陳先生筆下，翠綠的竹葉竹竿國然動人，而使人更驚喜的，就是竹枝不屈不撓，直上雲霄的精神，也躍然顯露於吾人眼前。又如山水，不僅是以峯廻路轉的境界呌人廻腸蕩氣，且能使人感到畫家本身的高潔，更如人物，雖則僅僅描寫一個轎夫，而我國「帝力於我何有哉」的勞動精神，也能巧妙地傳達出來，這眞是我們精神上滌垢去穢的良藥！</p>
<p>陳先生的繪書，並且幅輻是他的創作，就是草蟲花烏也都有他獨自的境界，不同凡饗。我看了他二十年的繪書，覺得愈是老年所作的，竟愈有精神，而愈能表現他的特色，使人深為感偑！本月二十日起，陳先生將其精品選出一八〇幅，假大新公司展覽。上海自抗戰迄今沒有看見過陳先生的繪書，渴望巳久，我想他這次展覽，一定能够引起上海極大的興奮的！</p>
<h3>嘔歌自然</h3>
<p>夕陽度西嶺，羣望倐已　；松月生夜凉，風泉滿淸聽。</p>
<p>我想借用孟浩然的詩句，禮賞君璧女士的作品。她用油彩和水色，墨筆，寫成她獨特風格，極饒詩意的繪畫，澹雅幽閒，然然意遠。黃山蒼松雲海，匡盧飛瀑淸湍，北戴河的浪淘沙，西子湖邊楊柳舞春風，紫金山器宇巍峨，故國宮牆，輝煌金碧，默西阿爾卑雪山的皎潔，樓霞山丹　的艷麗，冷靜與熱烈色彩相映成趣，她眞是一位自然美的嘔歌者，時代的詩人。</p>
<p>「臨流照影」和「浴後」等巨幅，是她精心結構的油繪。「皓首」「童額」諸造像，她描寫時代不同過程的深刻，令人發生無限感慨。應用了國畫題材，傳摹東方藝術精神，如「老道」，「採梅」，「舉杯邀明月」，「淚泊者之歌」，道都是藝圃的奇龍</p>
<p>她是一位天才作家，十三歲韶學巴黎摭西方藝苑之精英，抒東方自然的情愫，鷄鳴風雨，秋月春花，胸中蘊籍，腕底烟雲。極擭國際盛　，最後的成功，　於最大的努力者，　以此為君　女士祝·（土騏）</p>

<h3>漫畫地獄</h3>
<p>— 管中窺</p>
<p>佛說：「我不入地獄，誰入地獄」。據我想地獄一定是比天國更舒服，喜新厭舊，人之常情，天國住膩了，自然想入地獄。　」但丁又說；「萬物皆朽，惟地獄不朽」。則地獄永者底美，實際上是超過了天國，因爲天國是會朽的，極樂之後一定是悲劇，這是普遍的眞理，人們願意吃橄攬而不願吃金鷄納霜，同這個道理是相通的，在「神曲」中我們知道地獄共有九層，上四層通極樂之國，但路例雜走，下四層乃通「水刦之墟」，入此境域，即稱爲第二死，連靈魂亦遭了消減，不生不減，不垢不凈，量上還有比這通事更舒服的麼？既登天國，又降地獄，即是世界上悲劇之悲劇。</p>
<p>基督教徒之謂「聖經」中無地獄，這句話是不很正確的，在新的馬太福昔二十五章，讀最後審判之日即有「永火」，此所謂「火」其係地獄之謂歟？但這不是沉淪之地獄，乃是超昂的地獄，爲什麼？因爲這這是到天堂底階梯，能在地獄悔過的靈魂，必可入天國。</p>
<p>「上天無路，入地無門」。可見天堂與地獄，并無甚麼顯著的分別，因爲它們是被人相提並論，每個人固然喜愛天堂，何嘗又不愛地獄？怕地獄的人是永還登不了天堂，既入了天堂的人難道就不人地獄？「能悔過的人是有福了」—上帝原日是把天國之門和地獄之門同時開放的啊！</p>

<p>中國近年來，廣告已普遍的被利用，這是可以看出商業在進步。據我想，廣告的作用是在宜傳，目的是在推廣它的出品。一樣出品所以要宜傳，是那個出品爲新的，或爲人所不知道用的關係，廣告的宣傳有時不免稍爲誇大一點，但它不能離開眞實性太遠。這個眞實性便是對於主顧負責任的問題，因爲沒有眞實性的東西把它說得來天花亂墜，使人上當，這是扯誑，欺騙，無論對於良心，社會都沒有負責任。我們隨便翻開一種報紙，不管大報也好，小報也好，常常刋戲一些不負責任的廣告。這種廣告尤以醫藥品爲最多。一個稍稍有常識的人，都知道肺病在今日尚無特效專藥，但廣告上則有專治肺病之藥，淋病與梅毒目前雖已有特效藥，但也非三五月所能能治愈，有廣告所謂一日可愈，像這一類的欺騙廣告，翻開報紙俯拾即得，我以爲這類廣告，登的人不但沒有責任心，而且連常識也沒有。更奇怪的是衛生當局對這種廣告不加以取締，好像沒有看見一樣，因爲人民的智識太淺，有肺病人聽信了宣傳不根本去醫治而吃了那種「庸藥」，他如果死了，製造庸藥的人應負多大責任？報紙的責任是教育人民，有了這種廣告不但失却了教育性質，等於散播毒素，我希望這一類無常識無責任的廣告，報館應當拒絕登載，衛生當局也當嚴格取締。使廣告也同新聞一般變成教育性的東西。（三六六九。二十·於靑島</p>
<h3>番茄趣語</h3>
<p>— 觀榮</p>
<p>番茄，譯音「多麥多」，或「多曼多」（Tomato），是一種蔬類植物，莖高數尺，稱蔓延，葉呈羽狀，爲複葉，生毛甚密，花淡貢，菓色鮮紅，頗似我國柿子。與烟草及洋薯均爲美洲所產。自哥倫布發現新大陸後，歐洲方有移植，但十入世紀以前，默人尚不知這是可吃的東西。相傳最初將種子帶到英國的，是伊　沙白的情人華爾脫拉達，故時人稱爲「愛的蘋菓」（Love－apple），此於韋勃斯大辭典中也有說起。到十九世紀初葉歐人方開始吃番茄，並隨之播及全球。我國通都大邑，固人人知道番茄這種東西，但在邊僻縣份，却很少有人見過。番茄的華生力很强，種類也很多，小的如櫻桃番茄，葉粒很小，大的如牛排番茄，每只達二三磅之重。普通碩大如拳，圓形，但常生出不規則的畸形來。番茄抓植不良，容易得黃萎病，全體枯萎傳染而死。任何蔬菓，沒有如番茄可任意生吃熟炒，並以之製醬濾汁的。自生物學家發表番茄含多抓豐富的維他命之後，牠的踪跡更受世人歡迎與廣植了！</p>
<p>一九四○年在紐約附近地方有個呌喬治，克斯茍姆的人將番茄與洋薯（Potato）交配移植成功，產生出一種不含殿粉質的雜種來，他給牠取名爲「多派多」（Topatp），如此番茄與洋聲之間又多出一孳生兄弟來了！</p>
<p>月前，阿根廷總統夫人伊娃貝隘抵瑞士京城訪問，遭人投擲番茄，眞是別開生面的創舉。</p>

<h3>Zhang Qun Attends the参驻会议 (Council-Standing Committee Joint Meeting) to Report on Military Affairs, Diplomacy, and Economy; Actively Researching Controls on Volatile Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] Premier Zhang Qun, at the invitation of the Council-Standing Committee Joint Meeting on the morning of the 10th, reported on the general situation of his administration and answered questions, concluding at noon. Zhang's report was roughly divided into three parts: military affairs, diplomacy, and economy. In the end, he detailed the factors influencing the current price fluctuations, pointing out the situation of speculative merchants undermining national laws and regulations and not abiding by the law. He also reported that the Executive Yuan and the All-Economic Commission are currently researching control measures targeting the root causes of price volatility. He mentioned that they will improve shortcomings in the mechanisms and adjust personnel, aiming to achieve both short-term and long-term effects. Zhang's report was detailed; a brief summary is provided below:</p>
<p>Zhang first expressed that the evolution of the current international situation is becoming increasingly complex, and the domestic situation is unstable, making it difficult to provide a detailed account. He then divided his report into three points: military affairs, diplomacy, and economy, as follows:</p>
<p>Recovering the Northeast and Stabilizing North China is a Struggle for National Survival</p>
<p>Military Affairs: After the adjustment of military personnel's compensation, it has increased threefold compared to before August. Although this increases the burden on the national treasury, it is a reasonable adjustment given the instability of life during this time of suppressing the rebellion, and it is the first adjustment of its kind in twenty years. Secondly, regarding military efforts to suppress the bandits, the communist bandits are preparing to launch their sixth offensive on a large scale. The Chinese Communist forces in the Northeast still include a large number of Korean, Mongolian, and Japanese communist troops, reaching 190,000. The total number of communist bandits in the Northeast is about 480,000 to 500,000, with Korean communist troops accounting for one-third. This point should be closely monitored. Furthermore, since the bandit army launched its offensive in the latter part of last month, our military has suffered considerable losses in western Shanxi, and the Beining Railway was once forced to retreat, and the situation was very serious at the time. Fortunately, several armies were transferred from within the pass to provide reinforcements, which turned the crisis into safety, and there is no danger now. Zhang then reviewed the military situation in the Northeast, stating: The current war results, that is, the area of the recovered area, is smaller than in May of this year. The current area of the recovered area only accounts for 9.2% of the total area of the Northeast, the population accounts for 38.9% of the total population of the Northeast, the arable land accounts for 32% of the total area of the Northeast, and the recovery of productivity accounts for 27%. With more people and less land, it will not be easy to recover from an economic point of view, and the economic crisis is even greater. We had long anticipated the communist bandits' offensive in the Northeast, so adjustments have been made in both the mechanisms and personnel. At the same time, the military in Shandong was first concluded, and considerable strength was transferred to support the Northeast. However, the communist bandits have adopted a chaotic method, with Chen Yi and other troops harassing the provinces of Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangsu, with this very purpose. Zhang stated: We must not only recover the Northeast but also stabilize North China, which is a point that we must fight for for our national survival. Therefore, today's military focus is on the Northeast. Zhang then reported on the significance of organizing local people's defense forces and the content of the measures passed and announced by the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>We Wish Japan Peace and Self-Renewal; The Ryukyu Islands Must be Recovered; The Issue of Korea is Still Deadlocked</h3>
<p>Diplomacy: Roughly divided into one, our attitude toward the United Nations General Assembly, and two, our attitude toward the Japanese peace treaty, described as follows:</p>
<p>Our Attitude toward the UNGA: The significance of this UNGA is important, so Foreign Minister Wang is attending in person. Our delegation to the meeting has consistently adopted an independent and autonomous stance. The issue related to us raised by the UNGA is "The Use of the Veto." The amendment proposed by China is for conditional use. In the part on the peaceful resolution of international disputes, the veto should be abandoned. The United States did not formally express its opinion on this proposal, and it has now been included in the Political and Security Committee for research. Furthermore, the United States suggested that in the period after the adjournment of the General Assembly but before the amendment of the veto, a council of fifty-seven should be established to represent the General Assembly in performing its tasks. The Soviet Union believes that this violates the basic principles of the United Nations and expressed its opposition, and the United Kingdom also expressed indifference. No results have yet been obtained.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the Korean issue, we advocate that China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union should negotiate. However, the Soviet Union refused, saying that according to the resolution of the Moscow Conference, it should be decided by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. However, given the close relationship between China and Korea, this matter is still deadlocked.</p>
<p>The Dutch-Indonesian issue is related to the safety of our overseas Chinese, and we agree that the Security Council should conduct an investigation.</p>
<p>Our Attitude toward the Japanese Peace Treaty: Our principle is "We wish to see Japan peacefully renew itself, but do not want Japan to be a threat to peace, not to adopt a retaliatory approach, but not to give up compensation." The treaty includes several issues: A. Territory, that is, the Ryukyu Islands, we advocate must be recovered; B. Compensation. In this war, our losses were enormous, about 50 billion, and deaths reached over ten million, while the Japanese assets we received were only 900 million U.S. dollars. In the first batch of compensation materials from Japan, we can obtain 400,000 tons, which is currently being negotiated. As for the distribution of cash, the issue of Japanese assets in China is still under negotiation, and Zhu will make the final decision; C. The procedure for drafting the peace treaty. Our State Council has decided that the four countries should first conduct preliminary consultations, and then submit it to the countries concerned for discussion. Secondly, the negotiation and signing of the agreement must not involve the use of the veto, etc.; D. Control Issues. Whether its aggressive ideology should be controlled, China's basic principle on this issue is leniency.</p>
<h3>Bandit Harassment and Speculation Cause Price Volatility</h3>
<p>Economy: The Executive Yuan has promulgated two measures, one for fundamental solutions and one for temporary solutions. The temporary solution is the Emergency Economic Measures Program, and the fundamental solution is the Economic Reform Plan. Zhang then analyzed the factors influencing price volatility, which are affecting the stability of the economic order. One is that the military situation makes life unstable. The communist bandits are harassing everywhere, and both grain and cotton are affected. The other is the manipulation of the market by speculative merchants. Recently, one example that could be cited as an excuse is the Supervisory Yuan's publication of a report on the use of foreign exchange. This report only explained the situation of use without stating the situation of income. Merchants believed that the country's foreign exchange had been used up, causing panic and speculation. The gold and banknote market thus raised the wind of rising prices, and the black market was rampant, which is laughable. The second is the handling of materials arriving at the port with self-provided foreign exchange. Before it was passed, there were rumors that it could be unfrozen, causing importers to buy black market foreign exchange everywhere, thinking they could receive the goods arriving at the port, leading to a rise in prices. The All-Economic Commission specially sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate, and the investigation is still ongoing. We believe that there are many factors. For example, the issuance of large banknotes is set to stimulate prices. The Economic Commission is now studying a control measure, preparing to implement it in the short term to achieve results.</p>
<h3>Premier Zhang Answers Questions</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] Councilors Wu Zhaoxu, Yu Nanqiu, Zheng Kuiyi, and others raised questions after Zhang Qun's report. Wu proposed that the authorities should not only send personnel to investigate prices, but also severely punish those found guilty, using heavy penalties in turbulent times. Yu believes that some government measures inevitably address the symptoms rather than the root cause. For example, with the issue of banning dancing, without first seeking a way out for the dancers, suddenly banning dancing will inevitably lead to a black market for the dance industry. If this continues, the issue of banning dancing may lead to a repeat of the Shanghai peddler incident. He also said that the adjustment of the compensation of public educators is also the same, and that the increase is not a good strategy. Someone then asked about our diplomatic attitude and production loans, etc., and Zhang gave a comprehensive reply: The method for adjusting the compensation of public educators will still adopt the suggestion of the Legislative Yuan, using the cost of living index method for distribution. The method will be presided over by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics of the National Government, and a committee will be formed to handle it. Our diplomatic attitude is to hope to achieve world peace. In the past, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship was signed for this purpose. We do not want to be involved in the vortex of world competition. The loans from the Four United Offices will continue to be provided to the following three in the future: A. Production loans for daily necessities; B. Export commodity loans; C. Transportation project loans. The rest will be suspended to prevent funds from flowing into the market and forming floating capital.</p>
<h3>Northeast Industry and Mining are in Deep Crisis; Production Under Fire is Gradually Shrinking; Further Damage May Make Revival Difficult</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Office, 18th Dispatch] Northeast industry and mining are currently producing under fire, facing a deep crisis. Although work has not stopped amidst the great war, production is gradually shrinking, and some factories will be forced to flee, with great difficulties: The amount is insufficient, such as coal mines cannot be drained, resulting in loss. Transportation is cut off, materials have no source, and products have no way out. Employees are emotionally unstable, and production efficiency is very low. A person in charge of a certain mine said: If the Northeast does not achieve stability in the short term, industry and mining will suffer a fatal blow. If it is unfortunately damaged again, the remaining industrial foundation will be difficult to revive.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Leaves the US Tomorrow; Ambassador Wei Reports that US Newspapers Believe it is Inappropriate to Keep the Report Secret; Deciding on a China Policy is the Sooner, the Better</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 17th] Foreign Minister Wang will leave here on the 20th to return to the country. He will stop briefly in Tokyo on his way home to exchange views with General MacArthur and General Shang Zhen.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 17th] An editorial in the Scripps-Howard newspapers stated: "We believe that there is no reason to withhold the Wedemeyer Report for more than a month. Undoubtedly, Wedemeyer has provided some confidential strategies that are not suitable for publication. If this is the case, then this action is understandable. But this cannot be used as an excuse to keep ordinary reports secret. We are well aware that Truman and Marshall are busy with affairs, but the urgency of the China problem is second to none. Because the United States is sitting on the fence, Moscow and the Chinese Communists are taking advantage of this to make progress, so the sooner Washington announces a firm policy toward China and acts on this policy, the better."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 18th] The Herald Tribune commented on the Wedemeyer Report, saying: "Wedemeyer's report remains strictly confidential to this day, because the United States' new policy toward China is still undecided. The reason why the United States is in a dilemma is because: it would be absurd to pour millions of dollars into China to enrich private individuals or waste them. However, it would be equally absurd to see the Communist Party gain victory in China at this time."</p>
<h3>Communist Bandit Leader Fu Yinghua of Qiongzhou Island was Assassinated and Beheaded by Subordinates</h3>
<p>[Our Luzhou Office, 18th Dispatch] According to military news: Fu Yinghua, the communist bandit leader of Lingao County, Qiong Ang, was assassinated by members of his subordinate Bai Ju department a few days ago. During the War of Resistance, he killed countless government personnel and civilians.</p>
<h3>Chairman Inspects Yantai Port; Wang Yaowu and Shen Changhuan Fly to Qingdao One After Another</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] Chairman Chiang flew to Yantai today to inspect the seaport and personally instructed on restoration matters, and it is reported that he will return to Nanjing immediately.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] It is reported that Chairman Chiang will go to Shanghai to personally supervise the implementation of the new economic regulations to prevent price increases.</p>
<p>[Our Qingdao Office, 18th Dispatch] The Emei warship has been rescheduled to sail to Yantai.</p>
<p>[Our Qingdao Office, 18th Dispatch] Shen Changhuan flew to Qingdao from Nanjing on the 18th.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Office, 18th Dispatch] Wang Yaowu, at the summons of Chairman Chiang, flew from Jinan to Qingdao on the 17th to report on the recent military and political situation in Shandong.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Holds Continuous Meetings to Discuss Stabilizing Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] In order to stabilize prices, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has held continuous internal meetings for days to discuss appropriate measures. On the 18th, senior officials of the ministry again exchanged opinions extensively in the morning and afternoon. The majority advocated that strict measures should be taken on the prices of yarn and coal in major cities such as Nanjing and Shanghai to stabilize them as soon as possible. It is reported that once specific measures are formulated, they will be submitted to the All-Economic Commission.</p>
<h3>The Council-Standing Committee Joint Meeting Passes Two Proposals; Requests for Effective Protection of Returned Overseas Chinese and Active Development of Water Conservancy Projects in the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] The Council-Standing Committee Joint Meeting held its seventh meeting on the morning of the 18th and passed two proposals: One was proposed by Councilors Zheng Kuiyi and two others, requesting the government to effectively protect returned overseas Chinese. The other was proposed by Councilors Wang Huayi and two others, requesting the government to actively develop water conservancy projects in the Northeast. Both were sent to the government for handling. The contents of the two proposals are recorded as follows: (Continued on page 2, column 1)</p>
<h3>Trade Plan with Japan; Imports and Exports Include Soybeans, Sugar, Hemp, etc.; Passports Approved for Five Business Representatives</h3>

Regarding the method of appropriating funds for trade with Japan, it was decided to hand it over to the Bank of China, China Trust Bureau, and the Import and Export Management Committee to discuss the method, and then submit it to the Guidance Committee.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] The Trade Guidance Committee for Japan held its sixth meeting on the 18th and passed the review of five qualified trade representatives for Japan and will assist them in traveling to Japan in the short term. The names and types of import and export goods they plan to handle are recorded as follows: Overseas Chinese representative Zeng Jiyin, of Shian Industrial Co., Ltd., plans to export camphor, sugar, soybean cake, bran, medicinal materials, etc., and import steamships, hardware, machine parts, paper, rayon, chemical raw materials, etc. Overseas Chinese representative Wen Chaozhu, of Deli International Trading Co., plans to export bran, soybean cake, rhubarb, gallnut, etc., and import rayon, weaving machines, ammonium sulfate, rayon, etc. Northeast region representative Wang Zhuoran, of China International Xingye Co., plans to export pig bristles, red beans, licorice, etc., and import sleepers, fine yarn, spindles, ball bearings, bearings, etc. Chongqing region representative Mou Younan plans to export pig bristles, seed oil, leather oil, beeswax, raw lacquer, taro slices, etc., and import newsprint, pigments, rayon, etc. Taiwan Sugar Corporation representative Song Yixin plans to export 50,000 to 100,000 tons of Taiwan sugar and import industrial equipment and parts.</p>
<h3>A Batch of Railway Parts; To be Shipped from Japan to Shanghai at the End of the Month; We and Japan Sign a Contract</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th Dispatch] According to news from the Chinese Mission in Japan, regarding the sale of seven locomotives, two boilers, and forty-two freight cars to China by Japan, a contract was formally signed a few days ago because Japan agreed to reduce the price by about 15%. The parts will be shipped to Shanghai by the Flying Ring in late month,</p>
<h3>Authorities Discuss Distribution Methods</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 18th Dispatch] The Executive Yuan Compensation Committee recently convened relevant agencies such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Transportation to jointly discuss the distribution methods for the first batch of machine tools (9,400 units) as compensation from Japan. It was decided that the Ministry of Economic Affairs would receive one-quarter of the total amount in proportion to the original, and would allocate it to private factories. Other agencies would also receive their due share in proportion. The agencies will jointly discuss and decide with the Compensation Committee.</p>

<h3>A Thorough Review of Sino-American Relations</h3>
<p>— Cheng Tianfang</p>
<p>Mr. Caffery, the American Ambassador to France, recently published a sweeping "Impressions of China" in "Life Magazine," analyzing the current situation in China in great detail. On one hand, he urged the U.S. government to continue aiding China; on the other hand, he urged the Chinese government to implement eighteen reforms. He also advocated that President Truman send General MacArthur to China to establish a joint plan to prevent the Soviet Union from annexing China. After this article was published, it attracted attention and commentary from both China and the United States. Regardless of whether we fully agree with Mr. Caffery's conclusions, his detailed observations of the Chinese situation, deep understanding, and the friendship towards China that permeates his words are worthy of our praise. However, Mr. Caffery's article almost completely fails to describe the change in American public opinion in recent years and the misunderstandings of China among the American people, which have affected Sino-American relations. The United States is a democratic country, and public opinion has a great influence on the government's policy decisions. Therefore, at the request of the Shen Bao, I am writing this essay to conduct a review of the current Sino-American relations from a Chinese perspective, on the one hand to provide reference for those who are concerned about Sino-American relations, and on the other hand, I hope to seek correction from Mr. Caffery and American friends.</p>
<p>From early February to the end of August of this year, I stayed in the United States for nearly seven months. From the Atlantic coast to the Pacific coast, I traveled to more than twenty large and small cities, and visited many famous universities, newspapers, factories, and academic organizations. Because I wanted to understand the opinions of all levels of American society, in addition to visiting government officials, members of Congress, university presidents, professors, newspaper editors, scientists, writers, labor union leaders, and business tycoons, whenever I had the opportunity, I talked to newspaper reporters, university students, store clerks, factory workers, restaurant waiters, taxi drivers, housewives, and passengers on planes and trains, asking them about their views on the United States, China, and the world as a whole. I talked to about 5,000 people in total. As a result of talking to so many people, I came to the conclusion that the average American (The Man in the Street) has an extremely incorrect understanding of China. In their minds, the current China is full of chaos and darkness. They do not understand why, two years after the end of the war, when countries are gradually moving towards peace and stability, internal wars are still constantly breaking out in China. They consider China a mystery, an incredible country, and a world apart from the United States. In newspapers and magazines, one can often see criticisms and accusations of China. They believe that the government is incompetent, officials are corrupt, the economy has reached the brink of collapse, and the people's suffering has reached an unbearable level. In short, they are despondent about China, believing that despite the eight years of war, China is still the traditional China, always the same, and will never reform and progress. Therefore, some people (Professor Nathaniel Peffer is a prominent example) advocate a hands-off policy towards China, no longer lending money to China, and letting China sort itself out.</p>
<p>What is particularly strange is that the vast majority of the American people—perhaps more than 95 percent—are opposed to communism and advocate using all kinds of forces to stop its development. Therefore, they are willing to use large sums of money to help European countries threatened by communism. There is an Un-American Activities Committee in the U.S. Congress, and the federal government has the Federal Bureau of Investigation, specializing in monitoring and investigating the activities of the Communist Party. Federal civil servants found to be members of the Communist Party are immediately dismissed. In recent months, dozens of civil servants have been dismissed because of their ties to the Communist Party. But they take a different view of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). They believe that the CCP is different from the Communist parties in other countries and is a moderate rural reform faction that advocates land reform but not riots and killings. They believe that the CCP has no connection with the Soviet Union or world communism. They even believe that the CCP is a democratic political party that advocates freedom of speech, thought, and publication, while the Kuomintang (KMT) is a dictatorial political party that opposes all freedoms. Therefore, some of them even believe that the people in the CCP-occupied areas are "happier" than the people in the KMT-controlled areas. They call those who support the CCP progressives and liberals, while those who oppose the CCP are labeled as stubborn and reactionary, almost exactly as the CCP propagates domestically.</p>
<p>Six years ago, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, American public opinion heaped endless praise on China. Here are a couple of examples: The New York Times editorial on July 8, 1943, stated: "The whole world owes China a debt, because China suffered alone and we benefited. Now, although it is late, this debt should be paid off." James L. McConaughy, President of Wesleyan University, was even more explicit in his address when he took office as chairman of the United China Relief in July 1942. He said: "From the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937 to the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States lived on borrowed time. We owe China a debt, because these years were given to us by China. We will never be able to repay it! In these years, our cities, our homes, our children were all preserved, while China was ruthlessly devastated!" Compared with these words at that time, and today's American public opinion, it is simply a 180-degree turn.</p>
<p>What are the factors that caused this change? Of course, after the victory, we were disappointing, and exposed many shortcomings in political and economic aspects, which disappointed the friendly countries that sympathized with China, and this is undeniable. However, in addition to this, the following factors caused the change in American perception of China:</p>
<p>First, the constant propaganda of the Communist Party and fellow travelers in the United States over the years. The Communist Party is an extremely secretive international organization, and all Communist Party members around the world obey the orders of Moscow, so their actions abroad are consistent regardless of national borders. Since the CCP opposes the government, the American Communist Party (CPUSA) naturally opposes the Chinese government as well. Since the CCP denigrates the government as dictatorial, autocratic, and anti-democratic, the CPUSA naturally places the same labels on the Chinese government. Because the U.S. government fundamentally opposes communism, the publications of the Communist Party have very few sales, and the influence of the CPUSA's attacks on the Chinese government is not very great. But the fellow travelers of the Communist Party are different. On the surface, they are non-partisan liberals, but in reality, they are doing propaganda for the Communist Party without realizing it. For example, the writings, speeches, and broadcasts of Edgar Snow and Michael Lindsay have had a great impact. In particular, academic and cultural organizations related to China also have Communist Party members or fellow travelers infiltrating them. They use their qualifications as experts on Far Eastern issues to express their opinions on China. The general public is easily able to accept this without discernment, creating misunderstandings about the Chinese government and the CCP.</p>
<p>Second, the reports of American correspondents stationed in China during the war. These reporters lived in the rear of China during the war. The comfort of their lives was not only far inferior to that of the United States, but also inferior to that of Hong Kong and Shanghai, so they naturally felt pain. In addition, China implemented strict censorship during the war, and foreign reporters suffered all kinds of inconveniences. Therefore, when they returned to their home country, most of them expressed dissatisfaction with China. The most prominent example is Theodore White. When White was a correspondent for Life Magazine in China, he also wrote faithful reports, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also read them sincerely (see Life Magazine, May 1, 1944). However, his book "Thunder Out of China," published this year, completely distorts the facts, and is full of exaggeration, fabrication, and seemingly correct descriptions. He attacks the Chinese government to the greatest extent possible, makes all kinds of false accusations against Chiang Kai-shek, and praises the CCP to the extreme. He even said: "Those who have traveled within the territory of the CCP-occupied areas have escaped from the oppression of the Kuomintang and entered the area of light." Because his book is vividly written and uses the style of stories to describe the events before and after the war, it is very popular among Americans, with sales of hundreds of thousands of copies. White himself has reaped both fame and fortune, but the friendship between the Chinese and American peoples has suffered a great blow.</p>
<p>Third, during the Roosevelt administration, many "American communists" and fellow travelers infiltrated various departments of the U.S. government, including the State Department. These government secretaries used their positions to do work to protect the CCP. For example, reports that are beneficial to China are shelved and not sent to superiors or made public. Reports that are detrimental to the Chinese government are leaked. This alone has had a great impact on China. John Carter Vincent, the former Director of the Office of Far Eastern Affairs at the State Department, who was in charge of diplomacy, had great prejudices on Chinese issues. He often criticized the Chinese government and supported the Communist Party. At the end of February this year, he even attacked the Chinese government in front of Chinese officials at a banquet for a business group in New York.</p>
<p>Fourth, the impressions brought back by American officers and soldiers stationed in China. During the late stage of the war, tens of thousands of U.S. Army and Air Force officers and soldiers were stationed in Kunming, Chengdu, Chongqing, Guilin, and other places in the rear of China. They came with a full of enthusiasm to fight alongside Chinese soldiers or train Chinese troops. However, they inevitably became disappointed when they arrived in China. Because even though we sincerely welcomed them, due to the limitations of material conditions, their lives were certainly far less comfortable than they were in the United States. Especially when traveling inland, they were surprised by the low standard of living of the people in Chinese small towns and villages. They naturally did not do things as quickly and conveniently in China as they did in the United States. During the great retreat on the Xiang-Gui Railway in 1944, they also felt the chaos of everything in China. Because of these reasons, the feelings they brought back when they returned to their country were mostly bad and few good. They were not organized and did not contain any political meaning, but they told their relatives and friends about their impressions in China. However, because these veterans were distributed throughout the country, the impact was quite large. I have met many Americans who have never been to China and have never read books about China, but they have had bad feelings about the Chinese government. After investigation, they learned that it came from American veterans.</p>
<p>Fifth, the words and deeds of the Chinese people in the United States. The "China Daily News," run by the CCP in New York, constantly carries out propaganda to destroy the credibility of the Kuomintang and the government. Among the students studying abroad, there are also many people who speak for the CCP. In Boston, I saw an English magazine published by a student group, in which there were several articles attacking the government, which were no less fierce than the reports in American newspapers and magazines. What is most strange is that some senior officials who went to the United States for inspection took a large amount of foreign exchange given by the government to go abroad, but when they arrived in the United States, they carried out extensive anti-government propaganda. There are also Chinese professors at American universities who are extremely critical of the government. For example, in early April this year, Princeton University held a bicentennial celebration, with an exhibition of Chinese art and a lecture on Chinese issues. Many left-leaning sinologists and Chinese professors were invited to give lectures. The next day, a New York newspaper published a news report saying that what everyone found strange at the lecture on Chinese issues yesterday was that those who attacked the Chinese government the most severely were not Americans, but a certain Chinese professor teaching at the Far Eastern Institute of the University of Washington. A few days later, I went to visit Princeton, and the local international students showed me the manuscripts of each person's speech that day. This professor attacked the government for corruption, depravity, and oppression of the people, describing them in great detail, and exceeding the remarks made by the left-leaning sinologists by several times.</p>
<p>The above five factors have created the unfavorable impressions that the American people have of China today. The most important of these is, of course, the planned propaganda of the Communist Party. In addition to the fourth factor, the other second, third, and fifth factors are also directly or indirectly related to the Communist Party and fellow travelers. Why does the Communist Party do this? Because placing the entire China under Communist rule is an important step in the Communist Party's world revolution. The reason why this plan has not yet been realized is that, on the one hand, the Kuomintang is leading the people to resolutely oppose communism, and on the other hand, the strength of the United States is supporting the Chinese government in resisting Communist aggression. Therefore, the CCP does its best to sabotage and disrupt the country, attempting to subvert the government. The CPUSA spreads propaganda about China's weaknesses and vilifies the Chinese government, causing the United States to lose sympathy for China and isolating China, in order to facilitate the CCP's sabotage.</p>
<p>The Communist Party's work to sow discord between the Chinese and American peoples is not only being done in the United States, but also in China. In the United States, they expose China's weaknesses and fabricate propaganda about how corrupt, depraved, and incompetent the Chinese government is, distorting the facts and exaggerating them. In China, on the contrary, they do their best to promote the atrocities of the U.S. military and how the United States is interfering in China's internal affairs, arousing the Chinese people's antipathy towards the United States. Then, they turn around and use these incidents to tell the Americans how strong the anti-American sentiment is in China now, and why the Americans should not go to help China anymore. (In February this year, Ms. Stevenson, the Executive Secretary of the United China Aid Association of America, personally told me that she felt regret that there was an anti-American movement in China now. After I explained that this was a conspiracy of the Communist Party, she suddenly understood.) As the feelings between the Chinese and American peoples become more and more distant, the Communist Party laughs secretly from the sidelines: "You fools, you have all been fooled by me and don't even know it."</p>
<p>Therefore, American newspapers and magazines exaggerate China's shortcomings and attack China mercilessly (of course, there are also those who uphold justice and speak fairly for China, but those are in the minority), which makes us feel extremely troubled and think that this is an extremely unfortunate phenomenon in Sino-American friendship. However, we must remain calm and patient, and must not act impulsively or launch a counterattack, inadvertently stepping into the trap set by the Communist Party. I believe we should have the following views on American public opinion:</p>
<p>First, newspapers in any country like to sensationalize, exaggerate, and publish stimulating news (Sensational News), and American newspapers are even more so. Therefore, they easily go overboard and go to extremes when talking about good or bad, not only to China, but also to other countries and domestic news. Once we know this situation, we can take a more relaxed view of the praises and criticisms of American public opinion, and not pay too much attention to it. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, American public opinion praised us fiercely, and we really felt a little "ashamed to receive it" and should not be happy because of it. Today, American public opinion has swung to another extreme, criticizing us mercilessly. In light of past events, we do not need to be angry because of it.</p>
<p>Second, the American national character is frank and straightforward, sometimes even bordering on rude, which is exactly the opposite of the British national character of being implicit and profound. American newspapers often report on a person or thing nakedly without any concealment. When Americans talk to you, even if they have just met you, they can ask you many questions without hesitation, which makes you feel embarrassed, but they really do not have any malice. Therefore, in addition to the Communist Party and fellow travelers who have ulterior motives, we can only say that the criticisms, attacks, and accusations of China in American public opinion are misunderstandings and rudeness, and we do not need to think that they have embarked on the path of anti-Chinese or anti-China.</p>
<p>Third, American newspapers are used to speaking casually. They not only criticize foreign governments, but also criticize and attack their own governments in the same ruthless way. For example, when President Roosevelt was in office, some newspapers and magazines said that he was a dictator and that his New Deal was an extremist approach. How could the people who wrote these articles not know that Roosevelt did not want to be a dictator at all, and that the New Deal was tens of thousands of miles away from extremism? But for the sake of speaking their minds happily, they did so without realizing it. It is even more common for mayors of the city to be attacked by local newspapers. If we look at the words used by the opposition party to attack the mayors of New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, or San Francisco, we will feel that these cities are almost the most depraved and corrupt places in the world!</p>
<p>Fourth, the merciless attacks of American public opinion on China are certainly embarrassing to us. General Wedemeyer's open lecture to China in his capacity as a special envoy to China is especially rude in terms of diplomatic etiquette. However, if we remove the emotional component and think about it calmly, we cannot but admit that some of the things that the United States has pointed out are also facts. We ourselves do have many shortcomings, because we do not need to read American newspapers, but if we read Chinese newspapers, how can we not see repeated reports exposing the corruption of officials and the incompetence of government offices? Therefore, we can laugh off the words of American public opinion that are exaggerated. We can use correct propaganda methods to explain to the American people the malicious slanders. But what is said to the point is worth our vigilance and reflection, and can be used as a reference for our political and economic reforms. If the internal affairs of China can become clearer day by day as a result, then American public opinion will become the stone from other mountains that can polish our jade, and we will benefit from it instead.</p>
<p>In summary, we must not let the temporary reversal of American public opinion towards us affect the traditional and valuable friendship between China and the United States. This friendship is worth our extreme cherish, because among the world's great powers (including the defeated countries in the First and Second World Wars), the United States is the only country that has not used force to seize our territory and dependencies, and has not demanded concessions and spheres of influence. Since John Hay announced the Open Door Policy in China in the nineteenth century, the United States has spoken out for justice in many international conferences and has spoken many fair words for China. During the war of resistance, the United States supplied us with Lend-Lease materials (although the amount was much less than that given to Britain and the Soviet Union, this was because the Chinese coastline was blockaded and materials could not be imported, so until the victory of the war, there were still many materials in India that had not been shipped). The United States equipped our army with American equipment, sent army and air force personnel to train our army, and borrowed gold to stabilize our legal currency. Many Americans tightened their belts to help our refugees. After Japan surrendered, the American Air Force transported a large number of our troops to Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin to take over the cities. Of the six or seven hundred million U.S. dollars used by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) for relief work in China, 70 percent was provided by the United States. All of this proves that the United States has sincerely helped China and deserves our deep gratitude. Of course, Roosevelt's signing of the Yalta Agreement was something that was unfair to China and was a stain on American diplomatic history. However, Roosevelt's health was already very weak at that time and he could not withstand Stalin's pressure, so he rashly gave in. Many Americans are extremely dissatisfied with this matter now, and we do not need to blame it on the entire United States. In the past year, some things the American government has done have disappointed us, and the criticisms of American public opinion have embarrassed us, but we cannot let temporary differences obscure the good intentions that people have shown us in the past. This is definitely not the demeanor that a great nation should have, nor does it conform to the Chinese ancient teaching of "repaying kindness with kindness."</p>
<p>Of course, we also sincerely hope that American public opinion circles will cherish China's friendship with the United States. Even though China is still a poor and weak country and cannot provide much help to the United States internationally, it would be a pity to easily lose the friendship that 450 million people have cultivated over 50 years of history. Therefore, we hope that American journalists and writers of all kinds will not indulge in the pleasure of writing for a moment and unnecessarily stimulate the feelings of the Chinese people. In particular, they must not inadvertently become propaganda tools for the Communist Party. In addition, there is another stumbling block to Sino-American friendship, which is the American sense of racial superiority. Many Americans (certainly not all) always feel that white people are the chosen people and that yellow people cannot be mentioned in the same breath as them. Therefore, there is a contradiction in the United States, which is that in politics and diplomacy, Americans often help China, but in social interactions and daily contact, Americans often intentionally or unintentionally reveal a psychology of looking down on Chinese people. Although it is much better now than it was before the war, it can still be embarrassing for Chinese people at times. This situation is even more prevalent among Americans who come to China. As Caffery said: "Many Americans come to China with only limited power for a short period of time, and they mix the power, might, strength, and rule of the United States with their own personality, looking down on the Chinese people they come into contact with, who, from a human standpoint, are above them." The New York Herald Tribune criticized American merchants in China, saying: "They are proudly different and never maintain close and friendly relations with Chinese people... They despise Chinese ethics and practices and congratulate themselves on not being subjected to these constraints." If this mentality of the American people is not completely changed, a little shadow will more or less remain on the friendship between the Chinese and American peoples, which is a pity.

<h3>The Council of Advisors Passes Two Proposals</h3>
<p>[Continued from Page 1] The proposal to effectively protect overseas Chinese returning to their homeland, with the following measures: 1. Instruct customs officials to facilitate the passage of luggage carried by overseas Chinese returning home and strictly prohibit extortion by customs officials. 2. Allow overseas Chinese returning home to retain a reasonable amount of foreign currency to prepare for expenses when leaving the country. 3. Strictly prohibit harassment by military police and protect overseas Chinese returning home who are not familiar with the national situation. 4. In areas with overseas Chinese in Fujian and Guangdong provinces, the conscription system should be changed to a voluntary military system, as in Shanghai. 5. Strictly punish officials and heads of baojia in areas with overseas Chinese who take the opportunity to extort or illegally oppress overseas Chinese and their families.</p>
<p>The proposal to actively develop water conservancy projects in the Northeast to prevent floods: The Northeast Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau has responded to this need by submitting a five-year plan for water conservancy projects and a project to close breaches and restore embankments on the main and tributary streams of the Liao River in the middle and lower reaches, which can be said to address both the root cause and symptoms. The government should allocate special funds to supervise the implementation. 2. Further suggestions: the government should allocate large sums of money to start with dredging river channels, organizing equipment, and training navigators. Then, connect the Liao River and Songhua River with the Songyuan Canal, which is between Yingkou and Jiyang in southern Liaoning, to complete the major north-south waterway. 3. Develop farmland water conservancy: The enemy and puppet regimes have completed 4,610,215 mu of irrigation and drainage areas and land improvement projects, and 3,032,610 mu have not been completed. Many of those completed after the victory have been destroyed, and those not completed have stopped construction. The government should supervise the provinces and cities of the Northeast to cooperate with the Northeast Water Conservancy Bureau to quickly rectify the recovered areas and continue construction. 4. Monitor water power generation: There are 45 hydroelectric power plants in the Northeast that can generate 5.7 million kilowatts. The enemy and puppet regimes have completed Xiaofengman, Shuifeng, and Jingbo Lake, etc. After the victory, Xiaofengman was destroyed, and Shuifeng and Jingbo Lake are in the areas occupied by bandits. The government is requested to strictly order the national army to protect Xiaofengman with all its strength, and to repair and allocate it. For those not recovered, the government is also requested to recover them as soon as possible. Measures: 1. Broadly raise water conservancy funds, 2. Cultivate specialized talents, 3. Adjust the Northeast water conservancy institutions.</p>
<h3>People's Socialist Party Candidate List Expected to Be Submitted Today</h3>

<h3>Li Tie-zheng's Remarks: Military and Police Atrocities Against Overseas Chinese; We Made Three Demands But Have Not Received a Reply</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bangkok, 17th] Chinese Ambassador to Thailand, Li Tie-zheng, stated that China had made three demands to the Thai government regarding the atrocities committed by the Thai military and people against Chinese people in 1945. No reply has been received to date. The three demands were: to punish the perpetrators, compensate the Chinese for their losses, and guarantee that similar incidents would not occur again. China has never considered this issue closed, nor has it abandoned its previous demands. Li also denied that the 1945 incidents were caused by Chinese Communists or other Chinese. Li also corrected the Prime Minister's statement that China had abandoned the idea of allowing overseas Chinese in Thailand to participate in general elections, stating that he had informed the Thai government that no steps had been taken to collect ballots from Chinese people, but he had not received instructions from the Chinese government to abandon the election plan.</p>

<h3>Supplemental Record of Wang Chonghui's Remarks</h3>
<p>Yesterday's first page carried Wang Chonghui's remarks on "Japan's Admission to the United Nations." The latter part was omitted, resulting in a title without text. The supplement is as follows: "According to international law, the victorious nation may listen to the opinions of the defeated nation, but the procedure is that the peace treaty is drafted by the victorious nation and then submitted to the defeated nation for research, and the defeated nation is allowed to submit written opinions. The defeated nation may also be allowed to send personnel to attend the peace conference to express opinions or answer inquiries orally, but all of this depends on the decision of the Allied nations. However, at this time, the Allied nations have not yet held preliminary peace conferences with Japan, and the war against Japan has not yet ended legally. Japan is still an enemy country of the United Nations. Who would be willing to unite with it? The Japanese government and the public have repeatedly mentioned the peace conference, and the attempt to join the Allied nations is still news. Here, he pointed out that Katayama's hope to join the United Nations in his remarks was to ask for a high price, and his real intention was still to mix into the peace conference. This kind of conspiracy must be seen by the world, and the people of our country must be especially clear!"</p>

<h3>UN General Assembly Sets Up Standing Committee Case; British Propose Compromise Suggestions; Gromyko Says He Will Never Compromise</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 18th] Today it was learned that regarding Marshall's proposal to establish an annual "Small General Assembly" committee, the first priority is to vote to organize a drafting group to review the differences between the original proposal and the amendments proposed by various countries. Whether the United States can pass it will be a preliminary test. The US delegation is confident that it can be supported by a majority of countries, including China, the United Kingdom, and France, while other countries will oppose it. Soviet representative Gromyko said yesterday that any amendment would have no effect on the Soviet Union, and that the US plan violated the UN Charter and was illegal. There is no word "compromise" in the Soviet dictionary within the UN General Assembly. At the same time, the US proposal has been approved in principle by 16 countries, including China, the United Kingdom, and France. The debate in the Political Committee may end tomorrow, so that all proposals can be submitted to a group of experts for research.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 17th] British representative Shawcross stated today in the UN General Assembly's Political Committee that he would support the US proposal to establish a small plenary assembly, with important amendments. Shawcross stated that the United Kingdom is willing to support this proposal, but the powers of the interim standing committee must have the following restrictions: 1. It shall not deal with any matters that should be handled by the Security Council; 2. It shall not deal with matters that should be handled by the Economic and Social Council or the Trusteeship Council; 3. It shall not deal with disarmament or atomic energy issues; 4. It may only discuss matters under Article 11, Section 2, Article 14, and Article 35 of the Charter.</p>
<h3>To Promote Korean Independence and Freedom; Contents of New US Proposal; Requesting Amendment to the Trusteeship Clause of the Moscow Agreement</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 18th] US officials said today: After US representative Austin submitted a proposal on the Korean independence issue to the United Nations organization yesterday, the United States and the Soviet Union are expected to cause another heated debate. The Political Committee is expected to discuss the US proposal before the end of this month.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 17th] The United States today submitted to the UN Secretariat the long-awaited plan for Korean independence, advocating that free elections should be held in Korea by March 31 next year to establish a Korean national government and to withdraw all occupying forces as soon as possible. The US proposal also advocates that the UN establish a Korean Temporary Commission to observe the Korean elections and to provide consultations for organizing the Korean national government. The United States also advocates or concludes an agreement on the withdrawal of US troops from Korea. The Temporary Commission also has the right to report and make recommendations to the UN General Assembly on actions to maintain Korean independence.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 17th] US Representative to the UN General Assembly Dulles said at a press conference today that the US proposal on Korea aims to enable Korea to gain its deserved independence and freedom as soon as possible. He said that the United States has decided to delete the trusteeship of Korea as stipulated in the Moscow Agreement of China, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom in December 1945. He continued that the purpose of the US submitting the Korean issue to the UN General Assembly is to borrow the moral strength of this world organization to break the stalemate between the US and the Soviet Union on Korea in the past two years. When Dulles mentioned the Soviet Union's proposal that the US and the Soviet Union withdraw their troops at the same time, he said that there is a major difference between the Soviet Union's proposal and the current US proposal. To be clear, the United States hopes to establish a Korean national government first and then withdraw its troops, while the Soviet proposal advocates the opposite. He continued that there are only 45,000 US troops in South Korea, while the number of Soviet troops in North Korea is 90,000, and there are another 120,000 Korean troops equipped by the Soviet Union. He also said that there are a total of 30 million residents in South Korea and only 10 million in North Korea. Future elections should adopt a proportional representation system. Dulles continued that under the current circumstances, the US plan is the best way to resolve the Korean issue. He finally said that the US government had consulted with the governments of China and the United Kingdom before submitting its plan to the General Assembly, and that the proposed UN Korean Temporary Commission would be composed of 10 to 12 countries. They will try to do more inspections in Korea to make world opinion pay attention to and urge the Korean elections.</p>
<h3>US Proposes to Soviet Union; Mixed Committee Adjourns; Awaiting UN General Assembly to Handle</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 18th] In the 62nd US-Soviet Joint Commission here, US representative Brown suggested, "In view of the US proposal in the United Nations on October 17, the US delegation recommends that the Joint Commission should postpone the meeting and await the action of the United Nations."

<h3>Partition Plan for Palestine Difficult to Obtain Legal Majority</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 17th] People here express great doubt about whether the proposed partition of Palestine can obtain the necessary two-thirds majority in the final vote of the UN General Assembly. It is noteworthy that most Latin American delegations have expressed silence on this. Another noteworthy point is that the position of the Soviet bloc is not consistent. Although the Soviet Union supports partition, Yugoslavia supports the two races forming a federation.</p>
<h3>Different Motivations for US and Soviet Support [Reuters, London, 17th] Sir Hugh, the British representative in Palestine, said today that the Soviet Union and the United States have different motivations for supporting partition. The United States' motivation is to obtain Jewish votes in New York State. The Soviet Union's motivation is more cunning than the United States. The Soviet Union is now able to insert its foot into the Middle East on completely equal terms with the United Kingdom and the United States in one fell swoop.</h3>
<h3>Asian Economic Commission Expands Scope; Soviet Suggestion Vetoed</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 17th] The Soviet Union proposed to the UN Economic Committee on the 17th that colonies should be allowed to participate in the Asian Economic Commission without the permission of the sovereign state. When the case was put to a vote, it was rejected by a vote of 19 to 13.</p>

According to Committee Chairman Bridges: "French cabinet members have assured us that the French Communist Party will never enter the government."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 17th Associated Press] British Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman, Republican Senator Bridges, said today that the members of the Committee have informed the French government that the speed and amount of US aid to France will depend entirely on whether France excludes communism and stops strikes. He also said, "We have stated that we cannot tolerate communism."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 18th] French Prime Minister Ramadier told the striking Paris transportation workers that the government would not consider their wage increase demands if they did not return to work. However, 33,000 public transportation workers still voted to continue the strike in a general meeting today.</p>

France received a huge amount, worth $104,150,000, the Netherlands received $40,376,000, Austria received $29,460,000, and Italy received $4,280,000. The distribution of gold to France is especially meaningful as it is a few days before the French municipal elections.

<p>[Associated Press, London, 17th] The King of England met with Burmese Prime Minister Thein Kin Nu at Buckingham Palace after the signing of the Anglo-Burmese Treaty.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] President Truman today appointed Hurtle as the first US Ambassador to Burma.</p>
<h3>Allied Headquarters Order Japan to Implement Economic Decentralization</h3>
<p>[US News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] New York Times correspondent Crane reported that Allied Headquarters ordered Japan to implement the following new measures for economic decentralization: Companies in the following circumstances will be dissolved: 1. Those who control 5% of any important material; 2. Those whose business activities are sufficient to affect prices or exchange rates; 3. Those who merged after 1941. An economic decentralization bill has now been submitted to the Japanese Congress, with an order from the Supreme Commander's Headquarters that the bill must be passed quickly.

<h3>Contents of the Anglo-American Trade Agreement Approved by the British Cabinet; Decision to Reduce Imperial Preference</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] A State Department spokesman stated: The United States has made tariff concessions to Britain on many commodities. It is believed on all sides that the Anglo-American trade agreement has been approved by the British Cabinet and will be signed soon. The spokesman also revealed that relative trade agreements with Britain and several other countries will be formally signed on November 16, without the need for parliamentary approval, and will take effect on January 1, 1948. The spokesman declined to disclose the details of the tariff concessions, but said that textiles, porcelain, automobiles, and whiskey were all included. As for the concessions made by Britain to the United States, although details have not been revealed, it is only known that Britain has agreed to reduce the imperial trade preference system by 25 percent within two years. This British concession is contingent upon the United States not promulgating new barriers to certain products from British colonies. Overall, this agreement will provide Britain with immediate benefits, while the benefits to the United States will be more long-term.</p>
<p>[United Press, Zurich, 17th] The chief U.S. representative to the International Trade Preparatory Conference, Mr. Clair Wilcox, stated that the resignation of U.S. Undersecretary of State Clayton will not affect the tariff negotiations and the Havana Conference.</p>
<h3>Brazilian Authorities Draft Note of Severance of Relations with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, 16th (Radio): A report from the capital of Brazil in the "Manhna" newspaper states that on Friday night, the President of Brazil held a meeting with the Foreign Minister. Some people believe that the two may have been working on drafting a note of severance of relations with the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>American Machinery to Cease Being Shipped to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 18th (Radio): U.S. officials revealed that U.S.-Soviet relations have now reached a showdown. U.S. economic officials predict that the U.S. will stop shipping machinery to the Soviet Union in order to transport more materials to European countries implementing the Marshall Plan. There are two main reasons for this: the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate with the Marshall Plan; and the limited production of machinery in the United States, which is not sufficient to supply all the countries that need it. In addition, the Soviet Union's refusal to explain the purpose of its purchase of machinery is also a reason for the U.S. to stop shipping machinery to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's inability to obtain machinery from the United States will greatly frustrate the Soviet Union's five-year construction plan. Currently, U.S. exports to the Soviet Union have been greatly reduced. In the first half of 1946, U.S. exports to the Soviet Union (including lend-lease materials) were worth $223 million, but in the first half of this year, they have decreased to $91 million.</p>
<p>Thorough Review of Sino-American Relations (Continuation from page 2 · Cheng Tianfang)</p>
<p>Some people say that the reason why the United States is assisting China is for its own benefit. Others even say that the purpose of the United States helping China become a prosperous country is to turn China into an American market to promote American goods. Indeed, the foreign policy of any country in the world is based on its own position, and there is no country that only considers the interests of others without considering its own interests. May I ask, isn't our Chinese foreign policy also based on China's position? The United States has always believed that a strong and prosperous China can become a stabilizing force in the Far East and can contribute to world peace, which is also in the interest of the United States, and its assistance to China starts from this position. This policy is completely consistent with China's interests, and the traditional friendship between China and the United States is built on this common understanding. If this is said to be American selfishness, it can also be said to be Chinese selfishness, but this kind of selfishness is "enlightened selfishness," because it is beneficial to oneself and also beneficial to others, which is the cornerstone of international cooperation. Compared with ambitious countries that want to take China as their sphere of influence or support China's internal strife to achieve their aggressive purposes, that kind of selfish policy is truly incomparable. If China prospers and the people's purchasing power increases, the sales of American goods can be greatly expanded, which is naturally beneficial to the United States; but at the same time, China's production can also increase and the people's living standards can also improve. As long as China maintains the right to tariff autonomy, the development of international trade will definitely not be harmful to China.</p>
<p>Some people also believe that China's recent diplomacy has completely followed the United States and has become the tail of the United States, losing China's independent and autonomous status. This view is obviously influenced by Communist propaganda and is very wrong. It is true that in many international conferences, the United States' proposals often receive China's support, and on certain international issues, China and the United States often take the same actions. But this is the result of the same interests and consistent national policies between China and the United States, and it cannot be said that one is the tail of the other. For example, after the Pearl Harbor incident, China, Britain, and the United States jointly fought against Japan. This was based on the common position of safeguarding peace and resisting aggression. It cannot be said that Britain and the United States became the tail of China, nor can it be said that China became the tail of Britain and the United States. For example, at the Cairo Conference, President Roosevelt advocated fairness and insisted that the northeastern provinces, Taiwan, and Penghu should be returned to China, which was completely consistent with China's position. Can we say that this was the United States becoming China's tail? Moreover, China's foreign policy is not consistent with the United States in everything. For example, on the issue of the peace conference with Japan, because the pain we have suffered from Japanese aggression is far greater than that suffered by the United States, our understanding of the Japanese nation is also more profound than that of the average American. Therefore, China's view on the Japanese issue is different from that of the United States, and the proposals put forward by China are also different from those of the United States. This incident can illustrate that China has not abandoned its own position and followed the Americans in everything; at the same time, it can also illustrate that on other issues, China and the United States are often consistent, and China is definitely not the tail of the United States, and it will definitely not affect China's independent and autonomous status because of this. If we say that no matter what the United States proposes, we must disagree in order to show China's independent and autonomous style, then the so-called international cooperation will never be possible, and the "United Nations" will inevitably disintegrate.</p>
<p>Recently, the country has emphasized self-reliance. Therefore, some people doubt whether we should still ask the United States for assistance or accept American assistance in the future. Self-reliance is obviously the correct guide, but self-reliance and accepting foreign aid are not conflicting things. China is now facing severe internal and external troubles. There are great crises lurking in politics, economy, and society. If the people of the whole country cannot strengthen themselves and overcome difficulties with a spirit of hardship and perseverance, and rely solely on foreign aid, then China will inevitably embark on a path of collapse. This is why we want to promote self-reliance. But on the other hand, because we want to be self-reliant, we must reject foreign aid, which is like "refusing to eat for fear of choking." Let us take Britain as an example: In the late 19th century, Britain was the richest country in the world, and London was the world's financial center. After the First World War, its position gradually wavered. During the Second World War, Britain suffered even more severe blows, its national wealth was greatly reduced, and its foreign exchange was almost exhausted. Last spring, it borrowed a huge sum of 3.75 billion U.S. dollars from the United States to barely overcome the difficulties. But it was originally planned to last for four years, but it started to be used in July last year, and by the end of August this year, 3.35 billion U.S. dollars had been used, leaving only 400 million. Therefore, at the beginning of August, Prime Minister Attlee announced emergency measures, requiring people to be more economical in consumption and increase production, while greatly restricting the import of various goods. This is Britain's self-reliance. But Britain has not given up its attempt to borrow huge sums of money from the United States again. On the one hand, she can get a share of the entire European aid plan, and on the other hand, she continues to negotiate for separate loans. Britain still needs foreign aid so much. China's financial resources before the war were far less than those of Britain, and the damage suffered during the war was far greater than that of Britain. Why don't we need foreign aid to support our post-war reconstruction work? We are the country that has fought the longest and sacrificed the most, so we have the right to ask our allies for assistance in terms of morality, and the United States also has the obligation to continue to assist China in terms of morality.</p>
<p>The Father of the Nation's industrial plan is based on the principle of joint efforts by all countries to develop China's resources. As long as we use foreign capital and technology properly, China's nation-building work can be shortened by many years. Therefore, as long as it is loans and assistance that do not interfere in China's internal affairs and do not harm China's sovereignty, we should welcome them as much as possible.

<h3>Soaring Fuel Prices for Transportation Ships Force Half to Suspend Operations; Transportation Industry Sends Representatives to Nanjing for Consultation</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The National Transportation Ship Industry Association and the Shanghai Transportation Ship Industry Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday. During the meeting, Director Xu Xueyu reported on the disposal of ships after receiving a telegram from the Ministry of Communications to end the General Administration of Water Transportation Brigade. Yang Guanbei and Wei Wenhan were immediately appointed to handle the matter with the General Administration. Next, the discussion focused on the soaring fuel prices, which have accounted for more than 80% of the cost. All expenses for new construction, repairs, and materials cannot be maintained. Half of the transportation ships will be forced to suspend operations. The oil prices adjusted by the Shanghai Petroleum Company on the 7th of this month are far higher than the international allocation price, which is also unreasonable. In order to save the current crisis in the shipping industry, the government should allow official exchange rates for fuel oil for ships, exempt tariffs and additional taxes, and should have representatives from the transportation ship industry participate in the review and discussion when oil companies adjust oil prices. Li Lingliang, Cheng Yuqi, Wei Wenhan, Shi Fuchang, and other four representatives were elected to negotiate with the government. The four representatives went to Nanjing last night.</p>

<h3>Three Tenants Should be Summoned to Testify in the Huang Bohui Shooting Case</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Zheng Desheng, who is suspected of masterminding the shooting of Huang Bohui, the former owner of the Shishi Bao, in February, was prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office for attempted murder. Judge Zeng Jingzhong had already opened a court session once to interrogate him. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong opened the second court session to summon witnesses. First, Zheng's daughter, Zheng Jingyan, was summoned and asked how many people were at home and whether she knew the names of the Western gunmen on the night the plaintiff was shot. She replied that on that night, in addition to herself, there were her mother and a younger brother, totaling three people at home. As for the names of the Western gunmen, she did not know. The court then asked whether the high-quality cigars found on the table when the police went to her house to investigate after the incident were used to entertain Westerners. She replied that they were her father's. Then, witnesses Zhang Jingchang, Xu Wenhua, Chen Yonglu, and other tenants were summoned and interrogated one by one. The three people provided detailed information about the situation at the time, saying that they knew that two Westerners used guns to shoot. Then, Zheng Desheng was interrogated, and his confession was still full of sophistry. Finally, according to Huang Bohui's statement, the court stated the process of Zheng's attempt to seize the ownership of his Shishi Bao building, roughly saying that Zheng Desheng served as the rental agent from 1944 to September last year. After checking the accounts, he found that Zheng had collected more than 20 million yuan in rent, while only more than 3 million yuan was given to him. At the same time, he also leased empty houses without authorization, receiving a huge amount of transfer fees, and privately sold glass and other items. His intention to seize ownership was obvious. Because he was eager to recover the ownership, he caused a grudge, so he was undoubtedly instigated by Zheng to be shot, and so on. The court ordered Zheng Desheng to be detained and rescheduled for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Li Guangzhi Denies Taking Bribes in the Smuggling Case on the Meiqi Ship; Asks for Justice; Trial Concluded and Awaiting Judgment</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In the case of smuggling found in the luggage on the General Meiqi, a customs inspector named Li Guangzhi was accused of corruption. The District Court has tried the case several times and concluded the trial yesterday, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced at 2:25 a.m. yesterday. Li Guangzhi stated yesterday: The transcript at the customs was written by Sun Kedong and not by himself. After the General Meiqi arrived at the port on August 9, he exchanged a few words with Sun at the exit, but he had never met Sun before. He flatly denied taking bribes, saying that he was only responsible for inspecting goods and not luggage. He did not help in the luggage class that day. He was accused this time entirely because he was not good at flattering his superiors. He asked the court to seek justice for him. Witness Sun Baochang stated: He was the director of the luggage class at the time, and Li Guangzhi was not a member of the luggage class and was not assigned to help on August 9. According to Sun, such an incident was impossible. Li's defense lawyer, Mr. Huan Shichang, stated that the customs inspection matters were divided into two parts, one for the luggage class and the other for the inspection class. The powers of the two were clearly defined and could not be usurped. Since Li Guangzhi was an inspector, how could he be involved in inspecting luggage? The court ordered the debate on the case to be concluded and set a date for judgment.</p>

Representatives of the six companies generally agreed in principle to the establishment of labor hospitals, labor children's schools, and cooperatives, but there were many technical difficulties. Hospitals and schools cannot be built overnight, so the plan is for the six companies to jointly establish a labor hospital first, and then gradually increase the number. At the same time, the responsible parties of each company took the opportunity to ask Director Wu to convey to the competent authorities the current situation where the income and expenditure of each company cannot be balanced, hoping that the adjustment of water, electricity, telephone, and tram prices can be approved as soon as possible to provide financial support.</p>
<h3>Central Government Principally Agrees to Public Utility Price Increase</h3>

President Zhang of the National Bank has also telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for discussion, but the Ministry of Finance has expressed its unwillingness to accept this. Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, will visit Zhang Fuyun, Director of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, today to discuss this. Regardless of whether the negotiation results in levying tariffs based on the company's contract price or the market price, the authorities will have a decisive statement on the price adjustment of public utilities in this city on the 20th.</p>
<h3>Chairman Commends Economic Police Chief Yu; Director Visits Nanking and Returns to Shanghai – Reported on Student Strikes, Commodity Prices, etc.</h3>
<p>(Our News) Police Chief Yu Shuping recently went to Nanking. In addition to reporting to the central government on the handling of labor strikes and the stabilization of commodity price inflation in conjunction with the Social Affairs Bureau, he also requested instructions from the Ministry of Interior on expanding the police bureau's staffing and personnel issues, with the main focus on the placement of transferred military officers. Furthermore, emphasizing that the city's public security forces urgently need to be strengthened, he consulted with the Ministry of National Defense on issuing additional weapons and ammunition and requested an increase of 40 armored vehicles to strengthen the city's defense capabilities. Having completed his official duties, he returned to Shanghai early yesterday morning. In the afternoon, he met with reporters at the police bureau and said: "During this trip to Nanking, I met with Chairman Chiang, President Zhang, Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Interior, and Director Tang of the Police Administration, among others. On the morning of the 16th, I was personally summoned by Chairman Chiang. Chairman Chiang was very concerned about the situation in Shanghai. The first thing he asked about was the life and discipline of the Shanghai police and whether there was any corruption or malfeasance. I immediately replied that the vast majority of police officers and policemen are able to maintain their integrity and abide by the law. In particular, some of the current Shanghai police officers were left over from the former Shanghai Municipal Council and have served for one or two decades. They are all excellent individuals, and most of their families have side businesses, the sum of which is enough to keep their families warm and fed. Another part was recruited and hired after the victory. Most are young people who have not yet started families and have no family burdens, so although their income is meager, it is enough to support themselves. At the same time, the police bureau is making great efforts to promote welfare undertakings and has now established police apartments and dormitories, public canteens, police children's schools, and police mutual aid cooperatives, etc., so it can cultivate a clean and honest atmosphere. Then he inquired about the city's labor strikes and commodity price fluctuations. I reported in detail, roughly as follows:</p>
<p>The labor strike was caused by the discovery of a batch of bandit party lists during the search of the Futong Printing House, including workers from the American-owned Shanghai Power Company. After the arrest, a go-slow occurred. It was resolved after consultation with the Social Affairs Bureau. At that time, workers from the French tram company suddenly responded, making unreasonable demands and going on strike. At that time, the Social Affairs Bureau, in order to maintain urban traffic, hired new workers to continue driving under police protection. Who knew that troublemakers would take this opportunity to incite workers to destroy military vehicles, resulting in the arrest of 96 workers. Except for those found to have evidence of sabotage who were transferred to the court for interrogation, the rest were released on bail by the union and the company authorities, and the labor strike was quickly quelled." Chairman Chiang instructed: "In the future, attention should be paid to troublemakers, and they must not be allowed to stay in Shanghai." Director Yu also reported that the reason for the recent commodity price fluctuations in this city was actually due to repeated adjustments in foreign exchange and cotton yarn prices by the Textile Control Commission. Furthermore, due to factory power restrictions, output decreased, while production costs increased, resulting in an excess of demand over supply, coupled with pre-seasonal speculation, which caused commodity prices to soar to unprecedented levels. After the Economic Inspection Committee, chaired by Mayor Wu, decided to take strict measures and dispatched all economic police to monitor various markets, commodity prices generally fell. The Chairman was pleased to hear this. He immediately ordered more people to be added to the economic police and that the organizational methods of the economic police be submitted for review. At that time, it happened that grain merchants in this city sent representatives to Nanking to petition against the collection of grain business tax. The Chairman, concerned about the people's food supply, continued to inquire about this matter. I reported that the main reasons for the rising grain prices were that the sources were not smooth and that some factories and schools were hoarding rice. At the same time, there were many procedures from transporting rice from the production area to the consumers. That is, from the purchase in the production area to the rice milling plant, and then through the transportation company, the market broker, the grain wholesaler, to the rice store, and then to the consumers, the tax paid for each dan (unit of weight) of rice amounted to 100,000 yuan, so the rice price also rose invisibly as a result. After listening to the report, the Chairman paid close attention to it and agreed to have the food and finance departments reconsider it. As for the</p>
<p>Regarding the Jindu incident, Yu met with Vice Minister Qin of the Ministry of National Defense in Nanking. Qin said: "The military police part of this case has already been judged. The police part will be transferred to Shanghai for trial by the court and announced at the same time as the military police part." Finally, Yu told reporters that he had planned to expand the economic police to 100 people and make them independent. At the same time, he ordered all branch bureaus to pay attention to the reporting of economic criminals in the future. Qianghua White Paper was sealed up.</p>
<h3>Ordered Zhan Peilin to Persuade and Suppress Paper Prices; Qianghua White Paper Was Sealed Up</h3>
<p>(Our News) The Qianghua Paper Company at No. 51 Zijin Road was suspected of hoarding. Yesterday, the Economic Section of the Police Bureau seized a total of 267 rolls of white paper and 1,384 reams of cut paper. Xu Zhenyu, the person in charge of the company, was taken to the bureau for interrogation, and all the white paper was seized. In addition, yesterday morning, the section summoned Zhan Peilin, the chairman of the paper industry association, to the bureau to persuade him, hoping that the industry would automatically suppress paper prices. According to Zhan, the current market price has fallen from 1.2 million yuan per ream to 700,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, as a result of the police bureau's economic section and the Textile Control Commission's spot checks on various yarn factories in recent days, they are being reviewed together with Tan Yili, the leader of the yarn and cloth group of the Economic Inspection Committee. It is reported that the yarn allocation account books of the Guangdong Yarn Factory at No. 410 Mabailu showed that Wanfu, Chengzi, and Sanxin three households had been allocated a large amount of cotton yarn. The persons in charge of each household have been summoned by the group.</p>
<h3>Three Economic Committee Members Visit Garrison Headquarters</h3>
<p>The three members of the National Economic Commission, Shi Kuiling, Huang Yuanbin, and Liu Zhendong, who were ordered to come to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the city's commodity price turmoil, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning after reporting their duties in Nanking and started their investigation work again.

F&gt;Replicated industrial cloth registration decision should still be completed on schedule, the amount of raw materials in stock exceeding three months to be considered hoarding &lt;F</p>
<p>(Our News) The 12th Economic Inspection Committee meeting of this city was held yesterday in the municipal government conference room. Mayor Wu presided over the meeting. Shi Kuiling, a member of the National Economic Commission who was again dispatched to Shanghai to investigate the cause of commodity price fluctuations, also attended the meeting and said in his speech that he was currently collecting various data and would prepare a report and recommendations to be submitted to the National Economic Commission for review. Subsequently, the persons in charge of the gold and silver group, etc., reported on the inspection work of their respective groups in the past week, and then began to discuss the cases: The Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association and other nine organizations presented a report stating that the temporary registration method for cloth inventory has many difficulties in the replication industry, and sincerely stated their opinions, requesting adoption, etc. It was decided that the cloth registration for the replication industry should be completed on schedule. The investigation of the factory accounts from July to September should still be carried out. Raw materials in stock exceeding three months for the replicated industry will be considered hoarding. The limit for other industries is still one and a half months. This time, the hoarding and speculation of cloth must be thoroughly investigated and strictly handled step by step. It is strictly forbidden to ship edible oil to Japan. The municipal government has received a reply from the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Finance and has ordered the Ou and Zheng Customs to handle it accordingly. Regarding the reward for reporting black market gold and silver secretly, the central government has temporarily approved the cancellation of restrictions and will reward it at 30% across the board.</p>

<p>(Our News) Pan Jiuru, Pan Xulun's nephew, had a relationship with his fiancée, Shao Weirong, last year in September, and then abandoned Shao. He married a woman surnamed Gu in Shanghai on July 4th this year. Shao sued him for violating public morals. Yesterday morning, the case was heard in the Criminal Court No. 3 of the District Court by Judge Ye. Shao Zairong said that she was engaged to the defendant in 1945. On September 21st last year, she was induced by him to have a secret meeting in Wuxi. On October 13th, she continued once. Later, he lied that he was in financial straits and could not get married. Unexpectedly, he married Miss Gu. He actually committed the crime of defrauding marriage. She asked the court to punish him according to the law. Pan Jiuru confessed that he was engaged to the plaintiff on November 8th the year before last, but because he found her temperament strange, he entrusted a matchmaker to return the love letters written by Shao before May this year, declaring the termination of the engagement. He frankly admitted to having a relationship with her. Judge Ye persuaded the two to reconcile and live together, but Shao did not speak. Pan said, "This is not possible. It is not that I don't want her, but her behavior and temper are really bad. My conscience feels sorry for her." The court ruled that Pan Jiuru's criminal behavior occurred before the announcement of the Amnesty Order, and the court immediately declared in accordance with the law that "Pan Jiuru is exempt from prosecution, and the civil compensation fees will be handled separately by the Immigration Court."</p>

<p>(Our News) On the 14th, a major robbery case occurred in Jinji Bridge. The escaped bandit Zhang Dechang was arrested by the Zhabei Police Precinct near Xinzha Bridge the next day. Because it was under the jurisdiction of the Longhua Police Bureau, the bandit was transferred for handling. After interrogation by investigator Guo Zhikai, he confessed his real name as Gu Miaogen, also known as Little Pudong. At 5:00 p.m. on the 19th of last month, he used two guns to kill his clan uncle Gu Benxiang, the chief of the 16th Bao office in Gaoqiao District, and also shot and wounded Gu Ruliang and Gu Shenyan, two bao cadres. He also claimed that he had no regular job. He was first a pickpocket and then became a thief, committing a total of 11 cases. During the enemy puppet period, he hated his clan uncle Gu Muxiang for threatening him. On September 17th, he went to the countryside to request the issuance of a national identity card so that he could open a room in Shanghai, but he was rejected, which aroused his intention to kill his uncle. As for the two guns he was holding, one was held by his accomplice Wang Fugen in the Jinji Bridge robbery case, and the other was hidden at Ji Agen's place on the second floor of the Tiger Stove at No. 182 Changan Road in Zhabei. Police were dispatched to seize the guns and arrested Ji Agen for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Gold Focus Autumn Scenery</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang, 17th dispatch] The remnants of the communist bandits in northern Jiangsu, recently coordinating with Liu Bocheng's bandit troops who have been causing disturbances in the border areas of Jiangsu and Anhui, stirred up trouble at the end of September in Funing, Yancheng, Shiying, and Xinghua, all within the Huaihai Pacification Zone, as well as in Taixing, Taixian, and Jingjiang counties, within the First Pacification Zone. The garrison troops, in order to take the initiative and strike the communist bandits, withdrew all government agencies and civil servants from the county towns at the beginning of this month, retreating with the army into the territories of Dongtai, Xinghua, and Taixian counties, numbering over 40,000 people. Most of these refugees are poor and miserable. Fleeing their homes, their needs for food, clothing, shelter, and transportation have become major problems, causing them to wander and suffer. They earnestly hope that the government will learn from past mistakes, promptly devise effective measures, deploy large armies, eliminate the remaining communist bandits in northern Jiangsu, and thoroughly destroy the communist bandits' local organizations in the various counties of northern Jiangsu, in order to ensure the people's livelihood. It is reported that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has expressed great concern for the people of northern Jiangsu and may come to Zhenjiang for inspection this autumn and winter.</p>
<p>A person from Xinghua said: A certain brigade of the National Army's Liu's unit, which reinforced the county, has already entered the county territory. The government-controlled areas and both urban and rural areas are gradually becoming more stable. However, due to the influx of refugees, prices are soaring, and people's lives are quite difficult. Therefore, many have recently been leaving the area in groups to seek a living in Nanjing and Shanghai. It is reported that the Changzhou authorities, recognizing the importance of water defenses due to Xinghua's surrounding waterways and numerous harbors, and given its proximity to Ji Jian and complex terrain, plan to dispatch more new-type small gunboats to the county to assist the National Army in strengthening water security. In addition, Bu Zhenhai, the county magistrate of Xinghua, accompanied Zhang Guanqiu, the county magistrate of Gaoyou, to Huaiyin last week to present a flag and pay respects to General Zhang Xuezhong. Zhang Xuezhong inquired in detail about the public security of the county.</p>
<p>Defenses are being actively strengthened at various strongholds along the canal in Baoying and Gaoyou. In the villages of Dongtai and Xinghua, due to the military campaigns to suppress the rebellion, the people are burdened with heavy taxes.</p>
<p>After the autumn harvest, many farmers are crying out in hunger and cold, a testament to their suffering. The Executive Yuan has only allocated 300 million yuan to meet the needs of refugees in Jiancheng, Xinghua, Dongtai, Haimen, and Qidong counties. Among them, Yancheng received 100 million yuan, and the other four counties received 50 million yuan each. Although this is a drop in the bucket, given the government's tight finances, this relief fund demonstrates the government's concern for the people of northern Jiangsu. However, educators and intellectuals in various counties of northern Jiangsu hope that the central government will</p>
<p>quickly establish a fundamental plan for pacifying northern Jiangsu. On October 8, National Assembly representatives Li Hongru, Dai Tianqiu, Bao Mingshu, and Cui Xichen, from northern Jiangsu, repeatedly appealed to the press in Zhenjiang, emphasizing that "without northern Jiangsu, there is no Guozhen," highlighting the importance of the northern Jiangsu issue.</p>
<p>In northern Jiangsu, on one hand, there are natural disasters and banditry, and on the other hand, there are fat crabs and yellow chrysanthemums. At this time, the scenery of the Three Mountains of Jinjiao and Beigu, famous throughout the country, is particularly lovely. Over the past week, tourists from Nanjing and Shanghai have arrived in droves, with a particularly large number of visitors to Jiaoshan. The usually desolate Zhenjiang market is also showing some signs of life. However, at Zhenjiang Station, there is another picture, a stark contrast. Tourists arriving from Nanjing and Shanghai are resplendent, well-dressed, and like gods, while refugees fleeing to Nanjing and Shanghai are mostly emaciated and ragged, like beggars. With different circumstances, it is no wonder that after the tourists' sightseeing is over, they use the relatively lower prices in Zhenjiang</p>
<p>as a topic of conversation, while the miserable refugees complain that the prices for military tickets from Nanjing to Zhenjiang and Shanghai are the same, which is unfair. Why not consider the poor? (The ticket prices set by the railway bureau are the same from Nanjing to Zhenjiang and Shanghai, and passengers often complain.)</p>
<p>Grain prices and general commodity prices in Zhenjiang have also fluctuated sharply recently. Top-quality rice has exceeded 600,000 yuan per stone, and fuel and oil prices have more than doubled compared to before the Mid-Autumn Festival. Civil servants and ordinary people are all complaining bitterly. Citizens are surprised that while there is a severe housing shortage and difficult living conditions, the authorities are still focusing on superficial construction by demolishing houses and expanding roads.</p>
<p>Councilors of Zhenjiang County and representatives from various districts and townships gathered on the 10th. They jointly elected Chen Guangfu, from the Shanghai financial community, as a</p>
<p>candidate for the Legislative Yuan representing the First District of Zhenjiang County. Bu Yulin, a senior figure in the Zhenjiang press who was originally running for the Legislative Yuan in the First District, has, in accordance with the principle of the party member yielding to a more capable candidate, published a statement withdrawing from the election. Bu Yulin's election had been quite promising, and now his yielding to Chen is widely praised. In addition, Tao Yihu, a councilor of Zhenjiang County, recently proposed to rectify the Zhenjiang conscription administration and investigate the accounts of settlement fees, which has attracted much attention. It is reported that the Changzhou authorities have begun to investigate.</p>
<p>The list of committee members for the election offices in various districts, counties, and cities of Jiangsu Province has been approved, including 40 people such as Lin Xuyi for district election offices and 314 people such as Huang Xiangchen for county and city election offices. Among the members of the district, county, and city election committees, members of the Min, She, and Youth parties each account for 70 people. It is expected that under the enlightened decision-making of the government, the electoral administration in this province will proceed smoothly. (Special correspondent Chen Fang Canglang)</p>
<h3>Thorough Review of Sino-American Relations (Continued from Page 3) Cheng Tianfang</h3>
<p>Mr. Pugh suggested that the United States should loan China 1.35 billion U.S. dollars within three years. Among them, 600 million U.S. dollars would be a credit loan for China to purchase food, raw materials, machinery, etc. from the United States; 150 million U.S. dollars would be used as a foreign exchange stabilization fund; and 600 million U.S. dollars would be used for military aid to China to help China suppress the communist bandits. We highly agree with Mr. Pugh's principle; it's just that the foreign exchange stabilization fund of 150 million is really felt to be insufficient. I personally believe that the most needed thing for China right now is to reform the monetary system - issuing new currency to replace the legal currency that has reached the stage of malignant inflation. If the monetary system is not changed, inflation cannot be curbed, budgets cannot be balanced, prices will continue to rise, the living standards of civil servants and teachers cannot be guaranteed, the social economy will never be stable, and all construction will be impossible to carry out. Therefore, in addition to the work of suppressing bandits, the most urgent thing at present is this. However, to issue a new currency, there must be sufficient foreign exchange reserves. Without reserves, the new currency can be devalued again the evening after it is issued in the morning, and the result will inevitably follow the path of malignant inflation. If there are reserves, the new currency can freely purchase foreign exchange, the black market will immediately disappear, and prices will tend to stabilize. Then the government can talk about balancing revenue and expenditure, increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, and the financial situation can get on track, the national economy can be stable and developed, the living standards of civil servants and teachers can be reasonably resolved, administrative efficiency can be improved, and corruption can be eliminated. How much foreign exchange reserve is needed? Of course, the more the better, but at a minimum, I estimate that 1 billion U.S. dollars is needed. This is the key to the United States assisting China in political and economic reform. If you do not pay attention to this basic plan, small piecemeal loans are likely to be of no avail. Moreover, this loan, plus the other two loans proposed by Mr. Pugh, totals 2.2 billion. It looks like a large sum, but compared with the loan that the United States gave to the United Kingdom last year, it is less than 60%; compared with the funds needed for the Marshall Plan for European aid, it is even smaller. As for the various military, political, and economic reforms suggested by Mr. Pugh, I believe they are all worthy of the government's attention and adoption. However, the United States should not use these as exchange conditions for loans. Because it is one thing for the Chinese government to reform automatically, and another thing to implement reforms under the intervention of foreign countries. The former is welcomed by the people of the whole country, while the latter will inevitably arouse resentment from many people, because it damages the self-esteem of the Chinese nation, and it can also be used by the Communist Party to create discord in Sino-American friendship.</p>
<p>Will Mr. Pugh's proposal be adopted by the U.S. government? This is a question that many Chinese are thinking about. In my opinion, since Marshall returned to the United States, the U.S. attitude towards China has been wavering under a contradictory mentality. Unless this contradictory mentality is broken, it will be difficult for the U.S. policy towards China to be very clear. During the war of resistance, the U.S. government was influenced by the propaganda of the Communist Party and believed that the Chinese government was a one-party dictatorship and not democratic enough; therefore, on December 15, 1945, President Truman issued a declaration on China policy, stating that the Chinese government must expand its base and accommodate other parties to participate. Only after this point is completed can the United States provide further economic assistance. At the same time, he sent Marshall to China to mediate the disputes between the government and the Chinese Communist Party. Marshall's arrival in China was indeed with full enthusiasm, hoping that China could avoid the pain of civil war and achieve peaceful unification. Therefore, last summer, he braved the heat and went to Mount Lu eight times to convey conditions to the government and the Chinese Communist Party. The American officers under him also did not hesitate to take risks and carried out the task of mediation on the front lines. However, he did not understand the Chinese Communist Party's attempt to overthrow the government at that time, and did not realize that asking the Chinese Communist Party to abandon armed force and engage in peaceful political activities was like seeking skin from a tiger. As a result, Marshall and the American officers worked hard but to no avail, and after thirteen months of efforts, they finally failed and left. Because the Chinese Communist Party did not join the government, which is equivalent to the conditions in Truman's declaration not being met, the United States has not provided economic assistance to China in the past year and a half, except for relief goods and the transfer of surplus materials. Not only were there no new loans, but even the 500 million U.S. dollars that had been designated for aid to China were frozen in the Export-Import Bank and could not be used, and it expired at the end of June this year.</p>
<p>This is the factual course of events in the United States' policy towards China in the past one year and ten months, but on the other hand, the U.S. government's understanding of the Communist Party has undergone a significant change. Since the end of World War II, the U.S. government has followed the policy left by Roosevelt, hoping that communist countries can cooperate effectively with democratic countries. Later, the concept gradually changed, and today this hope can be said to have disappeared long ago. Although Marshall's mediation in China failed, it had one gain, which was to recognize the true face of the Chinese Communist Party, which is not a moderate rural reform faction. The Soviet Union's various actions in Eastern Europe have made the U.S. government deeply aware of the Soviet Union's national policy. Therefore, on March 12 this year, President Truman delivered a speech in Congress, requesting 350 million U.S. dollars to aid Greece and resist communist aggression (the so-called Truman Doctrine). In June this year, Marshall announced a policy to aid the entire Europe (the so-called Marshall Plan). When these two things happened, some people in the United States (including members of Congress) said, "We are trying our best to resist the development of communism in Europe, but in Asia, we want the Communist Party to join the government before we are willing to lend money to China. Isn't this extremely ridiculous?" Although Truman and Marshall have not publicly expressed their opinions on this point, I think they must be laughing secretly. Therefore, on the one hand, the U.S. government must continue to aid the Chinese government in accordance with its overall national policy, but on the other hand, with Truman's statement and the failure of Marshall's mediation, it cannot turn around for a while. Moreover, influenced by Communist propaganda, it believes that China is not democratic, not free, its politics are corrupt, and its officials are corrupt, and it feels that such a government is not worthy of assistance. This is the contradictory mentality of the U.S. government. Because of this mentality, coupled with the fact that the U.S. government has always placed Europe first and Asia second, and the European problem is also very serious, the Chinese problem has been temporarily neglected. Therefore, the U.S. government's performance on China policy in the past ten months has been to hesitate and be indecisive.</p>
<p>However, this situation cannot last long. The international situation is becoming increasingly tense, and the confrontation between communism and democracy is becoming more profound because the signboard of the Communist International has been rehung. In order to seek world peace and stability and to implement its established national policy, the U.S. government will inevitably continue the policy of aiding China during the war of resistance. Weidmaier's report has not been published to this day, and everyone thinks it is a mystery. According to my speculation, the content of the report must be to advocate conditional assistance to the Chinese government. Mr. Pugh's article may not directly influence the U.S. government, but it can clarify the American people's understanding of the Chinese Communist Party and their views on the China issue, and can promote American public opinion to support the U.S. government's active China policy. In this sense, Mr. Pugh's article is very useful. (After Marshall returned to the United States from Moscow, he personally told a Chinese diplomat that there was no question of the United States continuing to aid China, but there must be a reason or a way to get the support of public opinion and the consent of Congress.) From the standpoint of China, what we hope is that the U.S. government's aid must not be attached with conditions that China cannot accept, so that the good intentions of the United States will be in vain. At the same time, we hope that the U.S. government will understand the seriousness of the situation in East Asia, which is no less than that in Europe, and will not neglect Asia because of Europe. The aid to China should not be too small, and even more should not be too late, so as to reduce or eliminate its effect. (The End) But Allow Collection of Additional and Special Taxes</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu Urges Continued Price Reduction of Paper, Paper Companies' Account Books Returned</h3>
<p>(Our Report) Yesterday afternoon around 4 PM, Zhan Peilin, the chairman of the Shanghai Paper Merchants Association, paid a visit to Mayor Wu. Mayor Wu expressed great anger over the soaring price of newsprint, which had reached 1.4 million yuan per ream. Zhan offered an explanation, stating that the industry had never quoted such a high price; the highest quoted price was 1.2 million yuan, but that was only a quotation, and no transactions had taken place. The actual highest price was 1 million yuan. The association had halted trade gatherings due to the excessive price quotations. Simultaneously, an urgent announcement was issued, instructing member businesses to reduce the retail price of newsprint to 850,000 yuan per ream. Mayor Wu listened to the explanation and expressed satisfaction.

<h3>Draft Commercial Registration Law</h3>
<p>The current Commercial Registration Law was promulgated on June 28th, 1937. It has been in effect for a long time and is no longer entirely suitable for the current situation. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, based on its implementation experience and understanding of actual needs, has re-drafted the law, consisting of 63 articles. After review by the Executive Yuan on September 27th, 1947, the 10th Executive Yuan meeting resolved to "approve in principle, return to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, publicly solicit opinions from all parties, then re-organize the articles and submit them to the Yuan for approval." The formulation of the Commercial Registration Law is of utmost importance to the industrial and commercial sectors. The draft law is hereby published as follows:</p>
<h3>Chapter 1: General Principles</h3>
<p>Article 1: The term "commerce" in this law refers to any enterprise operated for the purpose of profit, but does not include professional occupations based on skills.</p>
<p>Article 2: The term "competent authority" in this law refers to the Ministry of Economic Affairs at the central level, the Department of Construction at the provincial level, the Bureau of Social Affairs in directly governed municipalities, the municipal government in ordinary municipalities, and the county government in counties.</p>
<p>Article 3: The term "person in charge of a business" in this law refers to the business owner in the case of a sole proprietorship, the partner(s) in the case of a partnership, or the partner(s) executing business, and, in the case of other forms of business organization, according to the regulations of the respective laws.</p>
<p>Managers or liquidators are also considered persons in charge of the business within the scope of their duties. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on Novels</h3>
<p>— Feng Ren</p>
<h3>Investiture of the Gods</h3>
<p>"Full of absurd words," is of course the nature of novelists, but even works like "Investiture of the Gods" are not entirely without basis. The "Old Book of Tang," Ritual and Music section, records the Six Strategies: "When King Wu attacked Zhou, the snow was more than ten feet deep, and the five armies and two horses left no tracks. They came to the camp seeking an audience, and King Wu was surprised and asked why. Grand Duke replied: 'These must be the gods of the five directions coming to receive orders.' So he summoned them by their names and appointed them to their respective duties." In this case, the five armies and two horses are the gods of the four seas, Zhurong, Goumang, Zhuanxu, Rushou, Hebo, Fengbo, and Yushi. Also, the "Records of the Grand Historian," Fengshan section, states, "The eight gods were created from the time of Grand Duke." Therefore, popular tradition is not entirely false. "Gui Tian Suo Ji" records Dai Lin's words: "In the past, a local man used all his savings to marry off his eldest daughter. His younger daughter was resentful, and the local man comforted her, saying, 'Don't worry about poverty, but because of the Shangshu Wu Cheng chapter's phrase "Only you have gods, may you assist me," it was developed into the Investiture of the Gods, and the manuscript was given to the daughter. Later, her husband printed it, and it made a great profit.'" Examining the Zhou Shu Ke Yin chapter: "King Wu then conquered the four directions, totaling ninety-nine states, and captured one hundred and seven thousand seven hundred and seventy-nine demons, and three hundred million people." Demons and people are mentioned separately. Although it is not known what the so-called demons are, it is enough to prove the basis of the novel. Guangchengzi is seen in "Zhuangzi," Chi Jingzi is seen in the "Hanshu" Biography of Li Xun, and the Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King is seen in the "Yuan History" Records of Clothing. Nezha is seen in "Sujian Zhi." The saying that the Second Master of Zhuokou is Yang Jian is not without basis.</p>
<h3>Romance of the Sui and Tang Dynasties</h3>
<p>As for the "Romance of the Sui and Tang Dynasties," the imperial palace affairs of the Sui Yang Emperor and the Tang Ming Emperor are very detailed, and all have some basis. Its earthwork projects, the imperial chariot for women, the dwarf citizen Wang Yi, and Lady Hou's suicide poems are found in the "Mi Lou Ji." Its narrative of Yang Su's secret plots, the names of the sixteen courtyards of the Western Garden, the names of the beauties, boating in the North Sea encountering Chen Houzhu, the plum blossom jade lily blooming, Sima Kan forcing the emperor, and Zhu Gui'er's martyrdom are also found in the "Hai Shan Ji." Its narrative of reading the Guangling map in the palace, Ma Shumo opening the river eating children, seeing Duke Xiang of Song at home, Di Quxie entering the cave, Huangfu Jun carrying a large rat destroying his feet, and women pulling dragon boats are also found in the "Kai He Ji." (All three records were written by Han Wei.) Its narrative of Tang palace affairs is gleaned from Liu Su's "Anecdotes of the Sui and Tang Dynasties," Cao Ye's "Biography of Mei Fei," Zheng Chuhui's "Miscellaneous Records of Emperor Ming," Liu Cheng's "Common Words," Zheng Qian's "Records of the Kai Tian Biography," Wang Renyu's "Events of the Kaiyuan and Tianbao Eras," and the anonymous "Records of the Great Tang Dynasty." It also refers to Li Deyu's hearing of the past from the old Liu clan, the "Outer Biography of Taizhen" by the palace musician Shi, and Chen Hong's "Biography of the Song of Everlasting Regret." It can be said that every word is derived from somewhere.</p>
<h3>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</h3>
<p>The book "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" is well known in every household. When Man Gui entered the pass, it was translated into Manchu and used as a military book. The death of Yuan Chonghuan was due to the use of Jiang Gan's stealing of books, which is naturally a bit funny. However, the history of the old era was originally the emperor's private record, so it is better to have novels and legends, which may reflect the truth to some extent. Wang Yuyang's "Xiang Zu Notes" also said: "Therefore, historical legends often preserve the integrity of the Three Dynasties, surpassing the filthy history written by the author many times. The predecessors said that children in the village listened to the stories of the Three Kingdoms, and frowned when they heard of Liu Bei's defeat, and jumped for joy when Cao Cao was defeated. This is what is meant by this. When propriety is lost, seek it in the fields, and the same is true of history."</p>
<h3>The Painting Reflects the Person</h3>
<p>— Hong Weifa</p>
<p>This was last winter when I was working in Nanjing. At that time, the best way to recover from work fatigue was to drink with Mr. Fu Baoshi and watch him paint. When drinking, whether he treated others or others treated him, they did not compete with each other but enjoyed themselves to the fullest. When the wine was flowing and their ears were buzzing, they would spread out paper and paint. When they reached a point of understanding, they would clap and laugh together. Then they would ask for inscriptions and take away a painting. He would happily write and happily give them away. It turned out that drinking and painting were close to his nature and were a way to express himself.</p>
<p>I think Mr. Fu's paintings can be said to be "the painting reflects the person." He is bold and unrestrained, so his paintings reveal boldness. He is calm and indifferent, so his paintings also reveal a state of tranquility. He has many certificates, so his paintings also reveal a strong scholarly atmosphere. He liked Shi Tao and had a deep understanding of Shi Tao's paintings, but his own paintings did not imitate Shi Tao. His landscapes have artistic conception, not just shocking people with chaotic rocks and waves. His figures have charm, not just attracting people with their appearance and dress.</p>
<p>Looking at his landscapes, people often have the thought that the mountains are endless and the waters are endless. "Just in this mountain, the clouds are so deep that I don't know where," it seems that many of his landscapes can be inscribed with such phrases, and it is precisely because of this that they are worthy of savoring. Looking at his figures, people will also increase their sense of worldly dust, because the figures in the paintings are too charming. This charm cannot be fully explained by the words "beauty" and "grace." If the figures in the paintings were also just attracting people with their appearance and dress, how could they purify life? And how could they be called works of art?</p>
<p>In fact, this situation is due to Mr. Fu's character and learning. I believe that in China, scholars are the most noble, and only true scholars can use the atmosphere of books to drive away the skill of craftsmen and become noble calligraphers. If we treat Mr. Fu as a Chinese scholar and appreciate his paintings, it will be easier to know the nobility of his works.</p>
<h3>Love and Life</h3>
<p>— Kuang Ying</p>
<h3>Love and Hate</h3>
<p>There is a Hebrew story like this:</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a king who hated "love" the most. He used very strange methods to deal with young men and women who were in love: he locked a fierce tiger and a woman in love in two empty rooms; and ordered the man to rush into a room within three minutes after a command to determine his life and death. If he rushed into the room where the tiger was locked, he would be devoured. Otherwise, the king would witness their marriage. In this way, many comedies and tragedies were staged. Later, the king's only daughter fell in love with a knight in front of the palace. Naturally, there was no exception, but the king temporarily hesitated because he was afraid that his only daughter would encounter a terrible fate, so he allowed the knight to exchange her for the most beautiful woman in the country. So, the knight, hoping to have a happy family in the future and avoid the tiger's mouth, went to beg the king's only daughter at night to give him a temporary indication of a target. She agreed, but she couldn't sleep that night, her chest was woven with contradictions. When the time came, the king's only daughter finally had the heart to deliberately point in the wrong direction and let her lover be devoured by the tiger.</p>
<p>Human "hatred" always follows "love" closely. When love is deep, so is hate. But one day, when one knows that one cannot preserve his "love," even the most concerned person will heartlessly watch him be destroyed without giving him a shred of cherishment. But, for thousands of years, who has ever torn down the hypocrisy of love between men and women with the palm of a tiger? Everyone uses sweet words and gentle means as a cover to deceive people.</p>
<p>In the end, love has bitten the innocence of many people. I suddenly remembered a sentence: love is like watching a lively scene, the people inside want to squeeze out, and the people outside want to squeeze in.</p>
<h3>Quotations from Lu Xun</h3>
<p>— A Shui</p>
<p>After I finish writing, I have to read it twice. If I feel it is awkward, I will add or delete a few words. I must make it easy to read. I don't often use newly created words and sentences that only I understand or that even I don't understand. (Today is the anniversary of the death of the old man Xun, so I am publishing a quote to mark the occasion. (Author)</p>
<h3>Viewing the Sea of Clouds at Qiyun Rock</h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>Mount Qiyun is more than forty li from Xiuning County in southern Anhui Province, and is two hundred feet high. Yisu Palace was built in the Ming Dynasty. The Incense Burner Peak in the center is towering and independent, and the distant view of the sea of clouds is extremely spectacular. (Author's note)</p>
<p>"Mr. Mai is really versatile." Liang Qun did not forget that the other party was a woman, but because she kept saying "this humble person," she called her "Mr." to cater to her psychology. Moreover, it is now common for women to be called Mr.</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? It's just a matter of assembling... But this humble person has a request; don't call this humble person 'Mr. Mai'. If you don't dislike me, if you treat me as a friend, call me 'Old Mai' or 'Little Mai'. I'm thirty-one this year. If we become close friends in the future, if you're willing to call me 'Brother Sha', although I'm not worthy, I'd be really happy..." As he said this, his eyes narrowed again.</p>
<p>Yao Qun suddenly remembered something when she heard the last sentence and was shocked. Although she remained calm, her eyes instinctively searched his body, especially paying attention to his throat to see if there was an Adam's apple.</p>
<p>"Don't misunderstand, Miss Ji..." He had already guessed Yao Qun's intentions. "Although this humble person has some Jianghu accents and tones, I'm not so vulgar as to cross-dress and deceive a big girl... But I can't explain it clearly. Although this humble person is also a woman, I've been enchanted ever since I saw you at the station, it's simply..." He probably meant "simply a love at first sight."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Mr. Mai... I have something else to do, I have to hurry..." Saying this, she looked at her watch towards this demon material. Yao Qun felt extremely embarrassed because this guy's actions and words were too cheesy.</p>
<p>"Oh!" This guy seemed to wake up from a dream. While rubbing his puffy eyes, he stood up: "Look, what did I come here for? ... Didn't I want to cooperate with you? First, seven or eight Chinese secret work comrades were captured by the radio station and circled by the Military Police Department. I plan to rescue them. Second, there are many young people and students here, but they are not properly organized. If they can be given guidance and united, the power will be really great..."</p>
<p>"Ah, what are the difficulties?" Yao Qun could only ask like this, keeping a distance.</p>
<p>"You know, it's not difficult to rescue them. I am willing to be responsible and guarantee that they will not run away. But the difficult thing is that they have no contact with me and of course will not listen to me. As for the students and young people, there is no connection between us, and of course they have no faith in me. Without faith, how can we organize them?"</p>
<p>"What do you plan to do?" Yao Qun had to squeeze his words out.</p>
<p>"There is only one way - as I said just now, as long as you are willing to cooperate, all problems can be solved." His attitude seemed very sincere, and there was no hypocrisy at all.</p>
<p>There is the following paragraph in Japanese history:</p>
<p>Once, when that fierce and ambitious emperor was on patrol, he saw a beautiful washerwoman by the river. He said: "Wait, I'm going to take you to the palace." This incident seemed like the ultimate good fortune to the washerwoman. She dreamed every night, even laughing in her sleep. However, day after day, the sun flew over her head, and when the washerwoman's face was as old as a wax figure, she still stayed by the river every day. But by that time the emperor had forgotten his promise.</p>
<p>A person who waits with weary eyes for the illusory and intangible dawn often receives some beautiful deceptions. People tend to yearn for the beauty of reality more than the castles in the air of dreams. Therefore, they often forget their true real life. By the time they realize it, the pain of life is like a snake biting and consuming your soul.</p>
<p>So, I got an interpretation of "life": -</p>
<p>Everyone makes life into a beautiful circle and locks themselves in this cage. After that, everyone is impatient with the cage of life and wants to break it.</p>
<p>In this, many sorrows arise.</p>
<h3>Welcoming Mr. Chen Shuren's Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Xu Weinan</p>
<p>It is not easy to be able to exhaust the skills of painting. It is naturally more precious to have both skills and to display the noble character of a calligrapher, and Mr. Chen Shuren alone can have both. He is truly worthy of being a first-class master in the contemporary painting world!</p>
<p>Mr. Chen has been working hard to paint for fifty years, and his attention has never wavered from painting. His mind is broad and his vision is high, so he can absorb and integrate the theories of Chinese and foreign painting. Of course, his works, from a technical point of view, have reached a perfect state in terms of composition, coloring and brushwork. But what is even more precious is that Mr. Chen's own integrity, which everyone admires, can also be fully revealed in the paintings. His works not only please the eye with beautiful lines or bright colors, but also have a kind of immaculate and noble, majestic and tranquil, elegant and dignified emotion bursting out. For example, the luxuriant green bamboo, in Mr. Chen's pen, the green bamboo leaves and bamboo poles are of course moving, but what makes people even more surprised is that the spirit of the bamboo branches, unyielding and soaring straight into the sky, is also vividly revealed before our eyes. Another example is landscapes, which not only evoke a feeling of excitement with their winding peaks and roads, but also make people feel the painter's own nobility. Furthermore, in portraits, even if only a porter is depicted, the spirit of labor of our country, "What does the emperor's power have to do with me?", can also be skillfully conveyed. This is truly a good medicine for cleansing our spirits!</p>
<p>Mr. Chen's paintings are also his original creations, and even the insects, flowers and birds have their own unique realm, different from the ordinary. I have seen his paintings for twenty years, and I feel that the older he gets, the more spiritual his paintings become, and the more he can express his characteristics, which makes people deeply admire him! Starting from the 20th of this month, Mr. Chen will select 180 of his fine works and exhibit them at the Daxin Company. Shanghai has not seen Mr. Chen's paintings since the Anti-Japanese War and has been longing for them for a long time. I think his exhibition will definitely cause a great excitement in Shanghai!</p>
<h3>Ode to Nature</h3>
<p>— Tu Qi</p>
<p>The setting sun crosses the western ridge, and the crowds look out and are quickly deserted; the pine moon gives birth to the coolness of the night, and the wind and spring fill the clear listening.</p>
<p>I would like to borrow Meng Haoran's verses to salute Ms. Jun Bi's works. She uses oil paints and watercolors, ink brushes, to write her unique style, extremely poetic paintings, light and elegant, leisurely and far-reaching. The Yellow Mountain's ancient pines and sea of clouds, the Lushan Mountain's flying waterfalls and clear streams, the waves scouring the sand of Beidaihe, the willows dancing in the spring breeze by the West Lake, the Zi Jin Mountain is majestic, the old country's palace walls are resplendent and golden, the purity of the snowy mountains of western Alps, and the splendor of the red mountains of Lousha, the calmness and enthusiasm of the colors complement each other. She is truly an ode to the beauty of nature, a poet of the times.</p>
<p>"Looking at the Reflection by the Stream" and "After Bath" and other large-scale works are her carefully structured oil paintings. "White Head" and "Childhood" and other portraits, she depicts the different processes of the era, which make people feel infinite emotion. Applying the subjects of Chinese paintings, conveying the spirit of oriental art, such as "Old Taoist", "Picking Plums", "Raising a Glass to Invite the Bright Moon", and "Song of the Homeless", are all wonders of the art world.</p>
<p>She is a talented writer, and at the age of thirteen, she studied in Paris, gathering the essence of Western art and expressing the feelings of Oriental nature. The rooster crows in the wind and rain, the autumn moon and spring flowers, the smoke and clouds in her chest and at her wrist. She has won international acclaim. The final success belongs to the greatest efforts. I would like to wish Ms. Jun this. (Tu Qi)</p>

<h3>Cartoon Hell</h3>
<p>— Looking Through a Tube</p>
<p>The Buddha said: "If I don't go to hell, who will?" I think hell must be more comfortable than heaven. People are fond of novelty and dislike the old, it is human nature. If you are tired of living in heaven, you naturally want to go to hell. Dante also said; "All things are corruptible, only hell is incorruptible." Then the eternity of hell is actually surpasses heaven, because heaven is corruptible, and tragedy must follow bliss. This is a universal truth. People are willing to eat olives but not quinine, and the same principle applies. In the "Divine Comedy," we know that there are nine layers of hell. The upper four layers lead to the land of bliss, but the roads are mixed. The lower four layers lead to the "ruins of the flood." Entering this realm is called the second death. Even the soul is reduced. It neither increases nor decreases, is neither defiled nor pure. What could be more comfortable than this? Ascending to heaven and descending to hell is the tragedy of tragedies in the world.</p>
<p>Christians say that there is no hell in the "Bible," which is not very accurate. In the new Matthew chapter 25, on the day of the final judgment, there is "eternal fire." Is this so-called "fire" hell? But this is not the hell of damnation, but the hell of exaltation. Why? Because this is the ladder to heaven. A soul that can repent in hell can surely enter heaven.</p>
<p>"There is no way to ascend to heaven, and no door to enter hell." It can be seen that there is no significant difference between heaven and hell, because they are mentioned in the same breath. Everyone certainly loves heaven, but who doesn't love hell? Those who fear hell can never ascend to heaven. Once you enter heaven, can you not enter hell? "Blessed are those who can repent" - God originally opened the gates of heaven and hell at the same time!</p>
<h3>Advertising and Responsibility</h3>
<p>— Zhu Mei</p>
<p>In recent years, advertising has been widely used in China, which shows that commerce is progressing. I think the function of advertising is to promote, and the purpose is to promote its products. The reason why a product needs to be promoted is that the product is new or because people don't know how to use it. Advertising promotion is sometimes inevitably a little exaggerated, but it cannot deviate too far from reality. This reality is the issue of being responsible to customers, because if something has no reality, it is described in such a way that people are fooled. This is nonsense and deception, and there is no responsibility to conscience or society. If we casually open a newspaper, whether it is a large or small newspaper, we often publish some irresponsible advertisements. These kinds of advertisements are especially numerous for medicines. Anyone with a little common sense knows that there is no specific effective drug for lung disease today, but the advertisements claim that there is a drug that specifically treats lung disease. Although there are now specific effective drugs for gonorrhea and syphilis, they cannot be cured in three or five months. Some advertisements claim that they can be cured in one day. This kind of deceptive advertisement can be found everywhere if you open a newspaper. I think that people who publish this kind of advertisement not only have no sense of responsibility, but also have no common sense. What is even stranger is that the health authorities do not crack down on this kind of advertisement, as if they have not seen it. Because the people's knowledge is too shallow, if lung patients believe the propaganda and do not fundamentally treat the disease but take that kind of "quack medicine", if they die, how much responsibility should the people who manufacture the quack medicine bear? The responsibility of newspapers is to educate the people. With this kind of advertisement, not only is the educational nature lost, it is equivalent to spreading toxins. I hope that newspapers should refuse to publish this kind of unscientific and irresponsible advertisement, and the health authorities should also strictly crack down on it, so that advertising, like news, can become something educational.

<h3>Tomato Trivia</h3>
<p>— Guan Rong</p>
<p>The tomato, transliterated as "Tomato" or "Tomanto," is a type of vegetable plant. Its stem can grow several feet high and spreads like a vine. The leaves are pinnate, compound, and densely covered in fine hairs. The flowers are pale yellow, and the fruit is bright red, resembling our Chinese persimmon. Like tobacco and potatoes, it originates from the Americas. After Columbus discovered the New World, it was introduced to Europe, but before the 18th century, Europeans were still unaware that it was edible. Legend has it that Walter Raleigh, Queen Elizabeth's lover, was the first to bring the seeds to England, hence it was called "Love-apple" at the time. This is also mentioned in Webster's Dictionary. Only in the early 19th century did Europeans begin to eat tomatoes, and they spread worldwide. In China's major cities, everyone knows what a tomato is, but in remote counties, few have ever seen one. Tomatoes have a strong vitality and come in many varieties, from small cherry tomatoes with tiny leaves to large beefsteak tomatoes, each weighing two to three pounds. Ordinary ones are about the size of a fist, round, but often grow into irregular shapes. If tomatoes are not properly cultivated, they are prone to Verticillium wilt, which can cause the entire plant to wither, spread, and die. No other vegetable or fruit can be eaten raw, cooked, or made into sauce or juice as freely as the tomato. Since biologists announced that tomatoes contain abundant vitamins, their presence has been even more welcomed and widely cultivated!</p>
<p>In 1940, a man named George C. Hough near New York successfully crossbred tomatoes with potatoes, producing a hybrid that does not contain starch. He named it "Topato," adding another sibling between tomatoes and potatoes!</p>
<p>A month ago, Argentine President's wife Eva Perón was visiting the Swiss capital when she was pelted with tomatoes, a truly unique incident.</p>
<h3>Suicide</h3>
<p>— Xiao Kangshi</p>
<p>Suicide is everywhere these days,</p>
<p>Unable to save oneself, unable to escape;</p>
<p>A coffin embraces the body, turning it into a dream,</p>
<p>Resenting the treacherousness of the human world!</p>
<p>The trend of suicide is rampant nowadays. Although its root cause lies in the sins of society and the treachery of the human world, the inability to save oneself and escape inevitably makes one feel that "life is but a dream!"</p>
<h3>Is It? Or Is It Not?</h3>
<p>— Lei Yi</p>
<p>Here are a dozen questions that seem true but are not, and seem false but are not. Use your intelligence to decide whether they are "true" or "false." If you answer more than two-thirds correctly, you can be considered very good. Disinfectants are the same as preservatives. Neuropathy is the same as mental abnormality. Dolphins are a type of large fish. Dragonflies cannot sting people. Crabs cannot walk backwards. You can get measles more than once. Spiders are not insects. Sunflowers always face the sun. Beryl is not always blue.</p>
<p>A dog having a black palate in its mouth is proof of pure breed.</p>
<p>Niagara Falls is the largest waterfall in the world.</p>

<h3>A Week in Film</h3>
<p>— Li Zhen</p>
<p>An excellent artistic film, "The Yearling," is the renamed and long-awaited "A Year-Old Ying."</p>
<p>"The Yearling" is a literary film that resembles a prose poem. The story is very simple, depicting the life of farmers in Florida, USA, with an eleven-year-old cousin as the protagonist, along with his parents. The daily lives of these three people constitute this plain story. However, through the expression of film art, we see this simple and unadorned literary work on the screen. This success should be attributed to director Clarence Brown, whose portrayal of characters and use of natural scenery have reached a transcendent level.</p>
<p>An Ordinary</p>
<p>"Mother and Son" depicts the issue of illegitimate children, but the author fails to find answers from the root of the problem. Instead, he weaves a tragic story. The development of Han Liren, Huang Su, and Han Chen – father, mother, and son – lacks careful arrangement, making the script seem scattered and too coincidental, weakening its effect.</p>
<p>If the script has shortcomings, then the director's performance is even worse. He cannot even make up for the deficiencies. The performance of "Thunderstorm" as a backdrop in the film becomes superfluous.</p>
<p>Actor Zhang Fa is the only success. Han Chen's character is portrayed vividly and prominently. Yan Shi's acting is formalistic and lacks inner performance. Lu Biyun grasps the character of her role for about half of the play, while Jiang Tianliu gives a vague and inconsistent impression.</p>
<p>Who would believe this is a top-notch romance? It is a complete lie. What "Where is the Beauty?" portrays is nothing more than the posturing and revelry of young masters who are bored with their idle lives.</p>
<p>"Where is the Beauty?" Therefore, it is a poisonous lie.</p>
<p>The first half of the script is extremely humorous, but it suddenly changes midway, turning from a farce into a horror show, which is very inconsistent in style.</p>
<p>Sun Jinglu performs well in the cast, while those who play servants, cooks, and drivers are all inappropriate. Wang Ban, a good actor, is wasted here, which is a pity. Not a Bad Comedy</p>
<p>This is a light comedy adapted from a stage play. The story is very simple, the plot is smooth, the dialogue is refined, and the actors are well-matched. Therefore, as a piece of entertainment, "Perfect Marriage" is not a bad stage play film.</p>
<h3>Jin Shengtan's Pen Name</h3>
<p>— Qiyuan</p>

<h3>Matchbox Camera</h3>
<p>— Zhengyan</p>
<p>During World War II, personnel engaged in secret work used a very small camera. This camera can be held in the hand and is not easily detected by others. Even at first glance, it is mistaken for a box of matches. Its size is extremely small. During wartime, Kodak only produced one thousand of these confidential and wartime cameras.</p>
<p>This small camera can take half-inch square photos. At the same time, there is another darkroom box that can be hidden in a pocket. The box contains a sixteen-roll film, bullets filled with photographic chemicals, and other necessary items for developing photos. It can be said that everything needed for developing is available. During development, simply place the film in a small glass container filled with chemicals.</p>
<p>The "MB" model camera is loaded with two feet of film, which can take about sixty photos. The lens ranges from F5 to F11, the shutter speed is 1/50th of a second, the distance scale is from eight feet to infinity, and the camera box has no viewfinder. To use it, simply press the small button on the camera with your finger, and the photography is complete when you hear a soft "click."</p>
