<h3>國防最高委會通過　各黨參加政府名單　憲政促進會名單即公布</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕民社，靑年兩黨參加四機構名單提出後，國民黨及社會賢達之參加人選問題，業於二十六日舉行之臨時中常會決定，並於廿八日上午十時舉行之國防最高委會通過各黨派參加立院監院參政會會三機構之名單。至憲政實施促進會之名單，則待政府明令公布，國民黨參加之名單亦將留待主席最後核定。茲誌大略如次：參政會，國民黨張善與等十一人，靑年黨張子桂等十一人，民社黨沙彥堦等十一人，社會賢達艾時等十一人，共四十四名。立委，國民黨趙允義等十七人，靑年黨劉東岩等十三人，民社黨張曜東等十二人，社會賢達芮逸夫等八人，共計五十人，監委，國民黨曹浩森等九人，靑年黨李不韙等六人，民社黨黃任賓等七人，社會賢達向乃祺等三人。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿八日電〕憲政實施促進會之常務委會委員及考察委會，宣傳委會與研究委會三委會全部委員名單，業經各黨派提出。今直接送呈蔣主席核閱後，將由國府命令發表。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿八日電〕中央常務委員會第五十七次會議，廿八日上午九時在中央黨部秘書處會議室舉行。討論新坩加國民然之立委監委，參政員及憲政實施促進會常委等人選，經票選結果，立委十七人，監委九人，參政員十一人，憲政實施促進會常委八十六人。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕民社黨前提四機構名單中，對憲政實施促進會中各委會之委員人選分配，未作最後决定。蔣勻田廿八日夜車赴滬，將該項名單再與滬方人士商洽後，提交政府。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿八日電〕國府三月一日將採取首决之具體步驟，結束國民黨廿年來之一黨專政。行政院及國府委員會三月十五日以前亦將改紙，如此，將結束國民黨之訓政時期，如蔣主席之所一再允諾者。</p>
<p>左舜夫氏發表感想</p>
<p>〔中央社南京二十八日電〕中國靑年黨宣傳部長左舜生頃對該黨參加政府改組之四機構發表感想。左氏稱本黨自參加國大共同制定憲法以來，即認定進一步共同推進民主，準備行憲，已屬實無旁貨。此次之參加四機構，實與參與制　之精神前後一貫。在四機構中，如國民參政會本議抗戰中創建之一民意機構，本黨曾於政協會議時提議擴大，且久經參加。此次略增人數，自無說明必要。憲政實施促進會原為國大所決定，吾人旣已參加國大，實行自己所決定之工作，亦屬當然。惟立法，監察兩院，過去原無國民黨以外之黨派參加，此次網報及於黨外，足見國民黨結束訓政之決心而立法院對憲法中若干子法亟待決定，自亦以由多方面參加意見，較為妥善。監察院職在整肅官常，，尤直接關係人民利害，匪吸收若干新的觀點，於加強行政效率，當亦不無補益。總之，吾人不能認此四機構之創建與調整即為政府之改組，但對民主之實現，不無關係。此則可斷言者也。</p>
<h3>新疆民族問題　行憲後可解決　張治中氏一週後返任</h3>

<p>答，彼等最近曾有兩次請願，所提要求約有：（一）人事問題方面，欲當局撤換某某兩處專員，（二）要求將郵局，電信局改為省營，（三）司法方面，法官漢人應行撤退等條件，惟吾人決取和平方式以開導之。</p>
<p>問，民卅四年一月間，宋院長曾向蘇方提出有關新疆經濟商談之意見，蘇方並未致答，張主席此次在京與蘇使彼得羅夫晤見，曾就此事交換意見吾？</p>
<p>答，去年十月，政府曾有牒文致蘇聯，惟蘇方迄仍在研究中。</p>
<p>問，張主席前在記者招待會上會稱：新省需要中央在財政上補助新幣二百億元，不卜現已獲政府允許否？</p>

<p>答，目前尚說不定何時可返。</p>
<p>問，是否將再為和談事返京斡旋？</p>
<p>答，余有此希望。</p>
<p>問，皖行觀感如何？</p>
<p>答，本人返皖觀感，所獲結論，乃全國各地普遍情形，即農林經濟之衰敗，人民生活之不安定，在在亟需改進。本人認為復興農村乃堅固國家之基礎。</p>
<p>問，對皖省政治人事有何意見？</p>
<p>答，無意見，人事問題在行憲時即可解決，因各項人選均將由民選而來。</p>
<p>問，對時局看法如何？</p>

<h3>資源委會工作概況　錢昌照在參會駐委會報告</h3>
<p>資源委員會會委員長錢昌照，昨晨九時在參政會席上，報告該會成立十四年來工作概況，同時並闡明該會主要任務在遵循民生主義，以發展國家資本，而目前發展國家資本之最大前提：歐在推進基本工業之建設，獎勵正當民營事業之自由發展及消滅官僚資本之為害。錢氏末並就本年度及兩年後全國資源之預計產量提出報告，全文錄後：</p>
<p>今天得機向諸位先生報告資源委員會的工作概况，覺得十分偷快，在報告工作之前，先提出幾個問題，向各位請教：</p>
<p>經濟建設正確路綫</p>
<p>第一，整個世界向前進，我們不能開倒車，關於經濟建設的路綫，約有三條：一為共產主義，一為資本主義，一為民生主義。共產主義似乎平等而十分不自由，資本主要似乎自由而十分不平等，只有民生主義，自由平等兼籌並觀，無疑的是最正確的路綫。發遠國家資本，為長生主義最重要原則之一，其目的在實現資本國家化，享受大眾化的理想。可惜，此次國民代表大會所制定的憲法，未能予以強調的規定，再就事實而言，特別關於基本工業，我國現在及最近三五年內，在物價變幻及一般利率特高情形之下，國內私人資本，決不會大規模的投資於基本工業，而國外資本，又丙政治社會狀况之未臻安定，裏足不前，設非政府以堅強的信心，充分的毅力，負起基本工業建設的責任，前途不堪設想，而原有之單薄基礎，勢必崩潰，人才亦將星敵。</p>
<p>官僚資本危害事業</p>
<p>第二，社會上一部份人士，時常提出國營事業與民　事業之爭的問題，在本入看來，我國生產落後，政府與人民的力量，均極有限，各可自由發展，無絲毫衝突的理由。此後應該根據整個經濟，建設計劃，分工合作，相輔相成。站在國營事業的立塲，本人認為政府除對惟利是風，罔顧國家民族利益之民營事業不予鼓勵及對反社會的結合，如托辣斯加迭爾等設法制止外，凡合理及開明之民營事業，應充分予以協助。</p>
<p>第三，最近有些人將國家資本與官僚資本混為一談，此乃一大差誤，所謂官僚資本，乃是利用官僚的地位，發展他們自己的私人資本，與國家資本之屬於全民者絕對相反。官僚資本之為害於國營事業，不减於其為害及民營事業，資源委員會同人對此點十分明瞭，本人並可担保，各事業負責人決不假公濟私。</p>
<p>調整工礦電力事業</p>
<p>現在再談資源委員會工作的本身，黃源委員會成立於民國二十一年，迄今十有四載，最初三年工作，僅限於調查統計與　計。民國二十五年起，開始舉辦事業，此後一年尚能按照所定步驟順利進行。二十六年抗戰發生不得不變更原定計劃，而從事於戰區廠礦之拆遷及後方廠礦之興建，抗戰期間，資源委員會在復方興建工礦及動力事業，計共七十九單位，所有地區之分布，產品之種類，悉依照抗戰需要。三十四年抗戰勝利，轉入建國時期，資源姿員會工作重心，一為對後方原有工礦及動力事業之調整，二為對收復區敵偽工礦及電力事業之接收整理。</p>
<p>後方原有工礦及動力事業之調整，原則有四：第一，凡事業純為適應戰時需要者，概予結束。第二，凡事業純為供應地方需要者，分別轉讓地方政府或當地人民經營。第三，凡事業產品銷路减少，而仍須由資源委員會繼續經營者，予以適當之　縮。第四，凡事業之性質屬於重要基本工業者，繼續維持並力謀發展，調整結果，結束者共十五單位，轉讓地方政府或當地人民經營者，共二十四單位，予以適當之緊縮者共四單位，繼續維特並力謀發展者，共三十六單位。</p>

<h3>資源委會工作槪况　上文接第一版</h3>
<p>敵偽工礦　整理原則</p>
<p>收復區敵偽工礦及動力事業接收整理之原則亦有四：第一，接辦事業避免零星，僅以重要基本工業及政府認爲必須由資源委員會負接辦者爲限。第二，接辦事業凡性質相同地區相近者，化零爲整，集中人力財力統籌經營。第三，接辦事業之組織儘可能採公司制。第四，接辦事業，以迅速恢復生產爲歸的。接收整理結果，東北九省共十九單位。各單位因被蘇聯拆遷及被共產黨破壞，現雖陸續復工，尚待積極補充。台灣由資源委員會與行政長官公署合作經營者共七單位由資源委員會獨辦者共三單位。各單位在戰爭期間經盟機轟炸，平均損失程度自百分之三十，至百分之六七十不等，除銅礦及鋁業兩單位仍在籌備期間外，餘均恢復生產，華北，華中，華南共二十六單位，除煤及鋼鐵尚有三單位仍在籌備期間外，餘均恢復生產。</p>
<p>卅六年度　生產預計</p>
<p>資源委員會於上年四月奉令改組，直隸行政院，現有事業計共九十五個單位，員工二十五萬餘人，各事業趨向企業化，組織上儘可能採取公司制，管理上力求科學化。縱的方面，分層負責，杜絕尾大不掉或頭重腳輕之弊；橫的方面，相互配合，俾收分工合作之效。技術上盼能迎頭趕上，一方面聘請外國專家來華協助，一方面派遣人員出國學習。現將三十六年度各事業之預計產量，約略言之：（一）電力：七十二萬四千八百五十九瓩。（二）煤：七百四十萬噸。（三）鋼鐵部份：鐵九萬九千噸，鋼品十萬六千噸。（四）石油部份：汽油二千二百八十三萬加侖，煤油九百萬加侖，柴油三億一千萬加侖。（五）金屬鑛部份：鎢砂七千五百噸，銻品五千噸，錫品二千六百五十噸銅二千三百噸，鉛六百六十噸，鋅六十噸，鋁四千二百噸，金一萬二千五百市兩銀十萬市兩。（六）機械部份：動力機六千匹馬力，工具機一百一十部，作業機及零件二千噸，機車十輛，貨車四百八十輛，造船二千噸修船十五萬噸。（七）電工部份：電機十萬另四百匹馬力，變壓器四萬七千八百千伏安，電綫十一萬七千四百圈，收發報機三百架，絕緣子二百五十萬件。（八）化工部份：酸碱三萬一千噸肥料五萬七千六百噸，動力酒精二百五十萬加侖。（九）水泥：三十四萬噸。（十）糖：十萬噸。（十一）紙：二萬七千噸。三十六年度之生產總值，預計約二萬三千五百億元，其中可供輸出換取之外匯約二千萬美元，此後復員建設工作，可利用日本賠償器材，並設法向外購置設備，祇須時局比較安定，明年底不難初步完成，後年起生產當能大大增加，一大部份並可完全自給。</p>
<p>卅八年度　可能目標</p>
<p>茲特提出三十八年度較有把握可能達到之目標，籍供參考：（一）電力：一百一十萬瓩，（二）煤：一千五百三十萬噸，（三）鋼鐵部份：鐵五十萬噸，鋼品五十萬噸。（四）石油部份：汽油一億八千二百萬加侖，煤油五千一百萬加侖，柴油一億零九十萬加侖。（五）金屬鑛部份：鎢一萬一千噸銻一萬零五百噸，錫五千七百噸，銅二千五百噸鉛四千噸，鋅二百噸，鋁一萬八千噸，金五萬七千兩，銀二十五萬五千兩。（六）機械部份：動力機四萬匹馬力，工具機二千部，作業機及零件一萬噸機車七十二輛，貨車二千輛，造船十一萬噸，修船一百三十萬噸。（七）電工部份：電機四十四萬匹馬力，變壓器四十五萬千伏安電綫七十六萬圈，收發報機二千六百架，絕緣子六百萬件，廣播收音機十五萬架。（八）化工部份：酸碱十二萬噸，肥料二十六萬噸，動力酒精一千三百三十二萬加侖。（九）水泥：一百七十萬噸。（十）糖：六十萬噸。（十一）紙：六萬噸。</p>
<p>歷年收支　稍有盈餘</p>
<p>綜上所述，國營工鑛及動力事業在全國生產中之緊要性，可以槪見。資源委員會經費，在國家總預算中，歷年平均，不及百分之二，以之發展基本工業，實屬不敷。在國家財政艱難之際，惟有在可能範圍內勉力推進國營事業，原不以營利爲目的，惟歷年收支尚能相抵，稍有盈餘，悉數解庫，此於民生主義所指示之發達國家資本，雖略具基礎，然較之世界先進各國，仍屬瞠乎其後，亟宜確定以生產爲中心之經濟政策，並使財政金融政策與之配合，俾得發揚滋長，完成基本工業在建國上應有之任務。尚希諸位先生多多指教，多多協助。（完）</p>
<h3>羅逆君强案審畢　昨四度受鞫猶圖狡賴　辯論終結定六日宣判</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕羅逆君强廿八日十時四度受審，對過去所爲一切，仍圖狡賴。開始辯論後，羅即朗誦其所擬就辯論文，滿紙「愛國不甘後人」「此心可質天地」等字樣，聞後令人齒凉，當渠宣讀至「傷心人別有懷抱」一句時，庭上可聞冷笑聲。後端木愷律師亦起立爲其辯護，盼能從寬論科，辯論至十二時半始畢，庭諭定三月六日宣判。</p>
<p>今日審羅由京高院第二法庭駱庭長允協主審，葛召棠李懷安　推事陪審，升庭後，即調查各種證據，羅對偽安徽省政府主席任內種種秕政，不惟不予承認，且自認爲對民衆有利之「德政」，言下頗有得色。旋由檢察官王文俊暢述羅逆種種罪行，認羅抗戰初期曾任政府要職，竟覥顏事仇，實屬罪不可逭。繼由羅逆答辯，舉出十大理由，推諉責任，雖承認附逆係誤入歧途，然强辯謂雖「同流」而未「合汚」。王善祥端木愷等律師，亦相繼就法理人情，爲羅逆辯護，王認羅在偽府僅爲中級幹部而非首要份子，請從寬就無期徒刑論科，又指出羅有協助抗戰行爲，盼能减刑，端木愷以辯護人兼羅逆知友雙重身份，說明羅於抗戰初期，愛國情緒極高，其後雖曆細故離渝，然絕非預有加入偽府計劃，羅附逆後種種行爲，可證明其「並無通敵之心，而有反敵之實」，最後王檢察官嚴詞駁斥，即辯論終結，庭諭三月六日宣判。</p>

<h3>中共人員的限期撤退</h3>
<p>政府業已訓令全國各地治安機關，對於京滬渝三地中共辦事處人員，於三月五日以前返歸延安，應加意保護其安全；本市警備司令部亦已接獲此項訓令，並於昨日正式通知上海中共辦事處。中共人員的撤退問題，在美國聲明放棄調處工作之後，早就發生；惟因政府當局寬大爲懷，一再容忍，終希望中共能有大澈大悟放下屠刀的一天，所以對於這個總理一直尚有作具體的決定。但是一個月來，中共匪特對於恢復和談，拒絕於千里之外；而且在軍事上，處處採取大規模的攻勢，從蘇北而魯南，由魯南而魯中，幾乎展開了全面的叛亂，這幾天來，東北也在醞釀着大規模的會戰；這種可怕的趨勢，足以證明現階段的共產黨問題，已非黨爭性質，魯中及東北的戰事，決不是共產黨與國民黨所發生的衝突，而是共產黨危害國家的叛亂了。所以今日的中共，已非普通的政黨可比，在政治上不能再享受合法政黨應享的權利了。中共旣不是合法的政黨，又怎樣能讓京滬渝三地中共辦事處人員留在原地呢？</p>
<p>我們再檢討一下京滬渝三地中共辦事處人員所作種種的活動，就不難知道這些中共人員，根本就在那裏幹些禍國殃民的工作。政府准許中共在京滬渝三地設立辦事處，原爲便利進行和談而出此；但是按之實際，三地中共辦事處的設立，對於和談，不僅無益，反而有害。在和談進行的過程之中，京滬渝三地中共辦事處，幾乎成爲中共發動宣傳戰的大本營，不正確的報導，不負責任的言論，極盡惡意中傷政府的能事，甚至不惜阻撓和談的進展，這些都是從這三個辦事處發表出來的。迨至和談停頓之後，這三個辦事處的工作，反而益趨活躍；姑以上海一市而論，中共人員的工作，也一直以下列二項爲某目標：（一）鼓動工潮，使社會陷於動亂的狀態下，藉以壓低人民的志氣。到了工人無法利用的時候，也就是變換新花樣，以愛用國貨爲烟幕，企圖引起大衆的反美情緒，勸工大樓的事件，就是在這種環境下造成的。（二）擾亂金融，加速國民經濟的破產，以達到其『促成國內經濟崩潰』的目的，這一次金鈔狂漲的風潮，中共混在其中興風作浪的力量，也是大有可觀的。本報社論早已指出這次金潮含有政治因素，也就是指中共而言。政府爲求地方的平安，爲求人民生活的安定，怎能再聽任中共人員在政府管轄區內破壞治安及擾亂金融呢？</p>
<p>勝利後政府所採取的國策，業經我國領袖一再重言聲明，簡言之，卽和平統一是也。這也是我們老百姓所日夜企求的。惟和平要是整個的，統一更要是完全的。過去政府爲求得國內的和平統一起見，曾不惜委曲求全，與中共進行談判，始終希望能循着政治解決的途徑，使國共問題和平解決。但是一年餘來，一再忍讓的結果，仍未能促醒中共的迷夢，以致談談又打打，打打又談談，蹉跎了一年多的光陰，到了最後，和談終於停頓，而無法恢復。政府雖然現仍希望中共能覺悟，所謂放下屠刀，立地成佛，使全國化干戈爲玉帛，但是在中共執迷不悟之時，對於國家民族以及全國人民所負的責任，自不能不忠實履行。目前中共不僅企圖武力割據，而且懷有以武力奪取政權的野心，政府對此，當不能不採取斷然處置，以求國內和平統一的早日實現。所以國軍在前綫，不論是在蘇北，魯南，魯中，魯西，魯東以及魯北，凡遇中共發動攻勢，莫不予以迎頭痛擊，以粉碎中共以武力奪取政權的迷夢。臨沂的重見天日，就是給好戰者的一個最佳的教訓。局勢發展到如今，旣已成了這種局面，政府自然也不必諱言以軍事的力量求得國內的和平統一了。在經濟上已實行緊急措施方案；在軍事上也有實行其他重要措施的必要，尤其關於軍隊的調動等，自不能公開聽任中共人員刺探情報。何况在中共人員之中，大半是擅長於情報的工作者，當不能再任其留在政府的管轄區之內。</p>
<p>由上所述，中共人員應自京滬渝三地返歸延安，自不待言；惟延安中共發言人對於這個問題，也發表過一次談話：內稱『京滬渝三地中共辦事處之設立與存在，以前皆爲政府與美方所請求及政府方面所許可，其任務爲與中外各方聯絡，包括聯總行總之聯絡在內。除非政府方面決心從此以後不再談判，正式通知中共撤退此等機關，或由中共方面彼等決定撤回，則決無取消之理。』中共發言人的說法，表面看來似乎也振振有詞，其實大謬不然。第一恢復和談，因中共拒絕而陷於僵局，中共旣不願與政府進行談判，留此聯絡機關又有何用？第二前綫各處的戰事，都是由中共發動攻勢而引起的。中共旣決以武力奪取政權，就喪失其合法政黨的地位，當不能在京滬渝三地保留其辦事處，更不能享受合法政黨應享之權利。北平市商會總工會曁農會三個民衆團體最近發表宣言，要求政府禁止中共人員享受人權。第三美國放棄調處工作，也是中共發動反美運動必然的結果，軍調部早已結束，中共也沒有與中外各方聯絡的必要了。</p>
<p>要之，政府對於中共人員，始終寬大爲懷，可謂已盡容忍的能事了。中共人員須知，稱兵作亂及禍國殃民的政黨，在任何民主國家，均沒有其法理地位，而今國民政府政黨還能顧念及中共人員的安全，雖限於三月五日以前返歸延安；但仍加以保護，可謂寬大到極點。所以我們希望中共人員，也能體諒政府的好意，在撤退的時候，切勿再有破壞的行動，殃及我們老百姓。</p>

<h3>研討外交「巨棒」政策　白宮舉行機密會議　外交及國會領袖均曾參加</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿八日廣播：杜魯門總統昨日召集其外交顧問及重要國會議員舉行機密會議，引起多方揣測，認為該項會議在醞釀一種世界性的外交決策。參加會議者均宣誓保守秘密，可見其意義之重大。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕杜魯鬥總統及國務卿馬歇爾本日在白宮與國會諸領袖，舉行極端秘密之會議，以研府美國之外交政策。傳杜魯門會向共和黨及民主黨國會領袖鄭重指出，馬歇爾在出席莫斯科外長會議時，有携帶「巨棒」之必要。據悉，出席白宮會議諸人曾神聖保證，除最廣泛之問題以外，不得洩露本日會議之詳情。但根據杜魯門邀請參院撥款委會主席勃里琪參加本日會議一點，衆信國防費用必在討論範圍之內。傳杜魯門認為中國最近關於預算案之爭執，恐將引起蘇聯之猜測，以為美國在海陸軍計劃方面業已暴露弱點。據可靠方面消息，杜魯門曾向列席人土解釋莫斯科會議之微妙性，及確有避免過分削减海陸軍預算案之必要。據參院主席范登堡談稱，該會議不過廣泛討論外交問題，及包括於外長會議中之歐洲問題。記者問以渠對外長會議樂觀與否，范氏答稱，「余之言語至此已告完畢，不再多言」。</p>
<p>注意希臘局勢</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿八日廣播；杜魯門總統昨日與國會領袖舉行秘密會談，討論中心為如何支持希臘抵抗蘇聯勢力之侵入，原因係英國目前己無力單獨支持希臘，而勢必撤退駐希軍隊。去年英國會在希臘方面支出六千萬鎊，現因國內經濟困難，將被迫放棄其在希臘之利益，衆信美國若不繼英而予希臘以支援，則此唯一未受蘇聯勢力侵入之巴爾幹國家，亦必被迫脫離西方民主矣。</p>
<h3>締結四強公約　維護歐洲和平　貝文擬向外長會議提建議</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿七日電〕下院今日開始外交辯論，由外相貝文檢討一般外交問題。據稱，英國亟望訂立四國公約，以維持歐洲和平。此問題當在莫斯科外長會議提出討論，屆時英國將擁護美國提議，締結四國公約，定期廿五年，確保德國解除軍備。英美兩國雖因巴勒斯坦問題發生誤曾，但仍團結一致，英美關係至為親睦，英國方面決不容任何勢力侵入，妨害兩國邦交，至於英法盟約，希望不久即可簽字。據巴黎方面可靠消息，貝文與法外長皮杜爾定下星期三在法國沿海某處簽訂此約。關於修正二十年英蘇盟約一節，據貝文宣稱，甚願蘇聯政府先由外交方面商討此事，蘇聯最初表示對於此的之不滿，則係田眞理報發表。英蘇法美四國締結廿五年互助協定之議，係去年四月間美國前國務卿貝爾納斯在某决和會中提出，其中規定四強於目前軍事佔領德國結束後，繼續佔據德國廿五年，貝文稱此一提案，當列入莫斯科會議議程。美個對於保持歐洲和平，如此休戚相關，實在偉大。英對德政策在謀地方分權與經濟統一。</p>
<p>英首批代表啟程赴蘇京</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿七日電〕莫斯科表團之首批人員十二人，已於今日專機離倫敦前往蘇京，從事佈置。貝文外相將率其餘隨從人員的百名，會同英國及目治傾記者二十人，美代表團一部份隨員十五人，渡海自法國卡萊乘專車取道比。德。波諸國前往。</p>
<h3>曼紐島代管問題　美澳謀解決</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿八日電〕此間消息靈通人士頃談稱：英國認為太平洋內前日本委治島嶼之將來地位，應由和平會議加以解決，英國抱此態度，現已通知華盛頓，澳紐亦抱此同樣立塲。關於澳自治領防務政策，英國今已向之保證予以擁護，尤其是對於澳政府在大戰時讓予英國之曼紐島。櫞美國在該鳥曾以二億美元建成一根據地，遂向澳要求將該鳥之委治權讓予美國，　現希望能在談判美國受管前日委治地之前，先行解決該項問題。</p>
<h3>美國將領重視國防</h3>
<p>〔聯合社伊利諾州埃爾琴廿七日電〕前任太平洋艦隊司令金上將今日在埃爾琴大學冬季演講會發表演說，主張振作武備充分警戒，據稱：美國海軍務須準備予敵人以迎頭痛擊。單靠空軍或原子彈，尚不足以取勝。原子炸彈或有防禦之法。原子彈不過為一種炸彈而巳，一種攻勢武器，就其本身言，絕不足以贏得戰爭。海軍之首要任務乃在保持美國之安全，其次在西半球之安全，再次為世界之和平。</p>
<p>〔聯合社台克薩斯州奧斯丁　七日電〕第四軍軍長溫萊特今日在台州議會發表演說，主張設立原子彈空軍及實施普遍軍事訓練，以策國家安全。溫氏稱：確保美國安全之最善方法，莫如建造十架或十架以上強大無朋之飛機，並隨時積存原子炸彈備用。此種轟炸機可裝足原子彈飛至地球任何地點，並可飛回。今日之世界僅有三大強國，其中一國巳在局部崩潰之中，另一國或可成為侵略者。一國之沒落，將使吾人單獨應付此一威脅。</p>
<h3>蘇訓練空運大隊　專作閃電式攻擊　人數達十萬淩駕其他國家</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕據今日從蘇聯洩露之消息，蘇方大的已有或現正訓練一支空運軍隊，其實力遠較他國之空運軍隊強大。聞蘇方訓練專作閃電攻擊之空運軍隊，達十萬人之多，美國陸軍受此訓練者僅一萬人。據租借數字所示，美國曾於戰時以運輸機七百架供給蘇聯。專家估計，祇須運輸機五百架，即可同時迅速輸送一萬二千人之軍隊一師及其全部配備。</p>

<h3>英法締盟獲協議　——下週二可在鄧扣克簽字——</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿八日廣播：貝文在下院聲稱：英法同盟條約之談判已成立協議，希望下週二在鄧扣克簽字。</p>
<p>法總理談話　認四強有諒解必要</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿八日電〕法國負責方面頃透露稱：英法同盟條約之簽字日期，或將予以展緩，外國方面所傳法國將依照英美兩國之標準統一其軍備之說，全係無稽之談。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿七日電〕法總理賴瑪迪本日舉行每週記者招待會，表示希望英法兩國能早日締結盟約，並預測英法蘇三角關係之和諧，一致足以造成莫斯科外長會議開幕前之有利空氣。賴瑪迪總理言之有謂，法國曾就德國問題向英美蘇三國提出備忘錄，英美蘇三國政府對於其中若干點，曾提出保留條件，對於其他若干點則表示異議，但在大體上反響尙稱良好。吾人或可經由四襲之妥協而獲致折衷解決辦法，吾人將竭盡所能，造成各國間之諒解空氣。英蘇兩國為締結盟約而進行談判，雖曾遭遇困難，但現仍順利進行中。英法談判係在蘇聯要求修正英蘇盟約而後開始者。莫斯科外長會議尚　解決對於德國現行困難之各項問題，乃為事實和平政策必須予以新的刺激，並减少各國間之猜疑，假更屬重要。</p>
<h3>美議員建議合併冰島　丹麥向美提抗議　謂此類建議殊屬不當</h3>
<p>〔路透社冰島首邑廿七日電〕冰鳥外交部長班奈狄克遜告議院稱：渠已令冰鳥駐美公使陶爾斯，向美國務院抗議加里福尼亞州共和黨戰員蓋爾哈特主張請冰島加入美合衆國作為第四十九州之建議。冰島認為在美國議院中提出此類建議，殊屬不當。蓋爾哈特當時並曾要求美國談判購買太平洋大西洋及加里比安海之島嶼基地。</p>
<p>又據合衆社華盛頓訊：此間各報一致認為美議員蓋爾哈特雖向國會提出此兩建議，但國會不致加以鄭重考慮。</p>
<h3>邀請蘇聯等國共同考察北極</h3>
<p>加外長在紐約發表演說</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿七日電〕加拿大外交部長勞倫特今日在紐約扶輸社發表演說，邀請蘇聯及聯合國其他國家　美加兩國共同考察北極。勞氏稱：余不知伺以在聯合國機構之內不應謀求種種便利，俾在最廣大之基礎上，探究關於北方區域之智識。余敢謂吾國樂於在此一事業上從事合作，但以實行互惠為條件。吾人巳根據互惠之基礎，與蘇聯鄰邦交換氣象情報，則何不推廣至其他有用之情報乎。蘇聯報紙關於美國與加拿大在極北活動之記載，出於捏造與誤會。加拿大並未以軍事基地　予美國。任何人均可目由進入加　北部。彼等可見馬尼羅巴區邱吉爾要塞之小小科學測量站，駐紮美兵不滿百人云。</p>

<p>根據政院通過組織規程　市府將裁員半數　市政會議決電宋院長陳述難再緊縮　請先派員視察再作決定　　上海市政府組織規程，業經行政院通過，據可靠消息，正式指令，尚未到達市府，繼通過修正之新組織規程，已由京中來人帶滬，據記者探悉，所修正之組織規程，內容為將原市府八局六處，改編為九局三處，九局中除原有財政，社會，工務，公用，地政，警察，敎育，衛生八局外，並將民政處改為民政局，原有六處除民政處改局外，僅保留秘書，統計，會計三處，人事處規定改人事室，新聞處於法無據，決予撤銷，並規定參事四人至六人。至於各局則規定不設副局長及專員，並將行政改為二級制，撤除處之設置，每局規定下設三科至五科，各科直接受局長之統制，各局僅准設簡任秘書一人，餘均薦任。按現市府及各局原有人數為三千三百五十四人，其中簡任一百二十五人，薦任六百八十人，委任二零十六人，僱員五百三十三人，若照新組織規程，則當栽减半數以上，尤以簡任荐任人員為甚。又各局原設之科，多者達十四科，最少者亦有六科，如遵照規定縮編，合併者當亦不少云。　　〔又訊〕市府新組織規程詳細情形如下：市府及各局原列人員三千三百餘人，經裁併後，祇能保留一千九百餘人，原有一百廿科，今後將裁併為四十八科，其中科員九百餘人，祗能保留五百餘人。目下各局人員，自二百七十餘人至四百七十餘人不等，而新組識規程限定者不過一百餘人，秘書至多不得超過四人云。　　〔本報訊〕昨晨市府舉行之第六十八决市政會議中，對於報載之行政院例會通過緊縮本巿市府區　　　，醫　　所討論。並據有關人士透露，會中對於中央該項決定，僉認為中央不能明察地方實情，市府編制已一再緊縮，現時各局處之工作皆甚忙碌，若再照中央規定裁减，一初工作勢將不能進行，則唯有全體總辭職。後由吳市長表示，現市府尚未接獲該項公文，有意見儘可向行政院提出。當經決定於昨日立即電呈宋院長，略謂自吳市長接任後滬市府編制已較前大事緊縮，後經參議會首决開會決定，又减縮其百分之八十，參議會二次開會時，又有緊縮之議案，市府因事實上有所困難，故請參議會派員親至市府視察，結果認為實已無可再縮。故雖行政院已通過裁縮草案，請姑念滬市環境特殊，且日來經濟動盪，社會秩序紊亂，而予以保留。並請行政院派員來滬市實地視察後再作最後決定。　　又記者曾於昨日分訪各有關方面，均稱，行政院公文尙未抵達市府，此項消息或不完全可靠，其中尤以裁撤人事處及秘書處更屬可疑。根據憲法第八十三條規定，人事處之職掌包括考試，銓叙，考績，級俸，陞遷，保障，褒獎，撫恤，退休，養老等，平時工作已甚忙碌，此番公敎人員實物配給委員會組成後，工作將更倍增，縮小自有其困難。按現時市府組織，各局中皆有人事室，各附屬機關中則有人事管理員，若將現時之人事處裁縮為人事室，將各局之人事室裁縮為人事管理員，則現時附屬機關之人事管理員將何以名之？且市府人事處去年曾呈由考試院轉請國民政府備案，係直屬中央者，似更無裁撤可能。經濟偵查綱開始活動　四機關負責　作全面監視　澈查金潮總報告擬就　　〔本報訊〕經濟監察團澈查金潮工作已於昨日正式結束，全部黑名單及工作總報告書亦已草擬完畢，日內即將派遺專人送京呈請蔣主席核示。黑單中人數及身份在未奉主席批示以前，尚不能發表。唯據悉：該項名單上列名者，共達四十餘人，名單上人物如何從事投機操縱，均有詳細說明，並附有確實證據。其中是否有所調「大老虎」則尚未悉。據關係方面透露，其中足够「老虎」資格者，尚不滿十人，以其身份別之，則以「官商不分」或有强硬背景者為多，純粹之公務員亦有若干，靑海省政府駐京辦事處處長趙佩即在其內。軍人或無之。其投機操縱之最高數目，聞未超過五千條者，此輩人物今後如何辦理，淞滬警備司令部將候令執行。　經濟監察團今日起對外名義將不再使用，但經濟監察工作將仍繼續執行，所不同者乃由集中之公開活動，轉變為分散密佈「經濟偵查網」之秘密方式，仍由組成經濟監察團之各單位分別負寶。今後全市經濟監察工作，將分四方面進行：（一）余鈔方面由警察局負責。（二）工廠方面由警備司令部負責。（三）銀行錢莊方而由中統局負責。（四）一般物價方面由軍統局負責。如有發現投機操縱抬價居奇者，將以警備司令部名義執行法辦云。　　〔又訊〕經濟監督團結束後，關於調查各廠商生產貸款之未了事宜，將由財政部及四聯總處繼續進行。至經監團前下令通輯之「黃金掮客」信大紗號老　孫子信，聞已逃往香港躲避。又湟中公司係向「同豐」號購進金條，昨誤記為「同豐裕」。經監團宣告結束　宣司令發表談話　　本市經濟監察團今日起對於制壓已往金融風潮之工作，告一結束。監察團之名義亦經取消。此後淞滬警備司令部將負責隨時指揮軍警協助經濟緊急揹施方案之有效實施，及防止經濟風潮，再度發生。記者為叩詢經監團十餘日來工作之概况，昨晚特走訪宣司令鐵吾，承發表談話如次：「上海為全國經濟之重心，牽一髮足以動全身，上决因金鈔市價激動，刺激物價普遍上漲，其現象為勝利以來所創見。當時民心惶惶，不可終日，一若大禍之將臨日本人以治安攸關，立飭警憲嚴密偵查，繼奉主席電示，澈查投機操縱，囤積居奇份子，不數日經濟緊急措施方案頒布，經各方努力，本市物價，漸入正軌。參加經濟監察工作各機關同人，宵旰勤勞，不無徽績。本日止，工作已可告一結束，此後關於物價管制及經濟緊急措施方案中所規定辦法，本市軍警機關，仍可本其職權，隨時負責推行。至此决風潮中之負責人，屬於銀行錢莊方面者，由財政部繼續澈查，屬於生產貸款部分者，由中央銀行稽核處負責根究。其餘查得有重大嫌疑者，可於今日以專案報請上級核示。總之，本團未了工作，已由主管機關繼續負責辦理，已無繼續存在必要，故以及時結束為宜。深望對於中央頒布之緊急措施方案，積極努力推行，勿再發生金融風潮，刺激物價，以安民生。」鄭介民訪吳市長　　奉中樞最高當局命令來滬澈查金潮之鄭介民將軍，昨日上午十一時許，至市府訪晤吳市長，洽談的半小時。金潮案之檢查工作，已告一段落，鄭將軍即將返京覆命，據有關方面表示，鄭氏拜訪吳市長，係向吳市長辭行云。泰申棧購囤金鈔　昨晨移送地檢處　　〔本報訊〕泰申棧購囤金條八十餘根，美鈔二萬餘元，被經監團查悉後，已於昨晨依擾亂金融罪移送地檢處，檢察官即將傳其經理陳克大到案偵訊。航業謀調整運價　派代表晉京請願　　本市輪船業公會，於前日召開會員大會，討論挽救航業危機辦法，當經一致機決：（一）實行全面聯營，統籌分配航綫，澈底節省航運費用，（二）調整運價，以維特航行成本，並推派代表晋京，向交部及政院陳述實際困難情形及調整運價之必要。各代表已於昨晚赴京。同時國營招商局總經理徐學禹，副總經理胡時淵，亦已應召赴京報告航業界實際情形。汽油恐慌消弭配售暫緩實施　　〔本報訊〕本市前因加油站汽油供求失常，亞細亞·美孚·德士古三公司，循公用局之請，決定採取定額分配制，經於二月廿二日起通知全市率輛所有人登記，原定今日起開始實行。茲：最近汽油恐慌之情形業已消弭，各加油站已少擁塞之現象，因此油公司當局徵得公用局之同意後，已決定將配舊辦法，暫行擱置，目前仍可自由灌注，但所有申請之登記將予保留，俾萬一再度發生恐慌情形時，隨時可以施行。禁煙緊急措施　本市切實執行　　蔣主席對於京滬兩地禁政，頗為注意，前曾特下嚴厲手令，上海市政府奉令後，即飭警察局與內政部劉禁煙特派員商定緊急措施七項：（一）登記煙民之未經調騐者，由警局勒傳調騐。（二）由衛生局公布担任烟毒調騐之醫院名單。（三）調騐後仍有療毒者，送請法院從重治罪。（四）飭各警察分局加緊偵緝吸食烟毒人犯及製販烟毒機關。（五）由警察局會商軍憲人員加强水陸空碼頭檢查，使烟毒無法運帶。（六）由民政處頓飭區保甲長認眞複查切實檢舉。（七）歡迎民衆檢舉，厚予獎金。據市警局行政處長兼本市肅淸烟毒會總幹事之方志超談：上項辦法，業已分別函令切實辦理。電話收報今起試辦　暫以現費電報為限　　本市交通部國際電台，奉令自今日起，試辦電話通知收取電報業務，儿居住於固定處所之發報人，在每日上午九時至下午五時內，如欲發加急，尋常，運緩三種現費國際電報，　撥電話一一二〇號通知該台派員收取，至記帳電報，則暫不適用電話通知收取辦法。又交通部上海電信局為便利民衆拍發電報起見，奉令亦自今日起試辦「電話通知收取去報」，各界如欲拍發電報，可將住址（國內電報暫以現費加急電及特快電兩種為限），用電話通知福州路七十號該局總營業處（電話一三〇五九），當由該處指派外勤報務佐，按址前來收取電報，所有應付之費，由報務佐當面核算收訖，並　發電報回執。出差汽車價格　廿分鐘九千元　電車公共汽車並未加價　　〔本報訊〕據公用局局長趙曾珏告記者稱：外傳電車及公共汽車今日起自行集體漲價，絕對不確。公用事業非經該局核准，不得調整價格。　　各出差汽車公司擅自增價一倍，每二十分鐘，由六千元增至一萬二千元。今日起，該局將嚴予取締。公用局已批准出差汽車價格，自三月一日起，漲價百分之五十，每二十分鐘，收費九千元。吳局長發表談話　盼市民共渡難關　　物價工資惡性循環　必須同時予以抑止　欲免空前危機此乃唯一措施　　社會局局長吳開先頃對物價及工資問題，發表談話，有所闡釋，原詞如后：　　中央此次訂定經濟緊急措施方案，並規定在京滬兩地嚴格執行。本方案中，關於物價工資及日用品供應各點，在上海地區內，屬於本局主管的範圍，本人爰再加以說明。　　物價增漲，是由於物資缺乏，物資之形成缺乏，是由於秩序未能全臻安定，以致交通不便，運輸困難，不能貨暢其流，這是一個最主要的原因。另一方面，因為游資充斥，，投機者操縱，助長物價的增漲。在工業方面，因為物價的增漲，工人生活指數增高，製成品成本增高，物價更因而循環的上漲。因此，物價與工資，變成互為因果，成為一個循環上漲的現象。物價與工資永遠競賽著，其終極結果，必致形成極大的危機。要解救這個危機，必先制止這個物價與工資惡性循環的現象，停止牠們的競賽。因此對於物價與工資的抑止，必需採取一個連鎖的統一的辦法。本方案中決定抑平物價，同時限制工資，以一月份生活指數為標準，這自然是日前唯一適宜的一個措施。　　緊急措施，目約有二　　中央這個措施，其目的，一方面在協助生產事業的發展一方面在維護勞工生活與人民生活的安定。有些人或者以為限制物價，將影響到生產事業，限制工資，將影響到工人的生活。其實這個見解，殊不準確。因為如果不抑止物價，物價永遠的直綫上漲，工資提高，成本提高，原料品價格提高，又因物價高昂，人民的生活匱乏，而减少銷路，廠方的製成品，因生產不能與消費配合，以至貨物滯積，而無人過問，日久必趨於沒落。　　在工人方面，因為物價永遠增高，廠方貨物缺乏銷路，必致工廠停閉，工人造成嚴重的失業恐慌，必致工廠與工人兩者同歸於盡，所以工廠與工人方面必須了解道個道理，共同擁護這個政策，使生產增加，物價减低，才是一個正當的途徑。　　薄利多銷有利工廠　　在原料方面，因為一般物價的普遍减低，生產者自然也能减低其售價，况且政府又設法疏通來源，取締囤積投機，這都是能使原料和成本减低的因素。加之政府對於外匯的嚴格管制，外貨輪入，成本日高，消費者必多採取國貨，銷路更臻暢銷，是因物價限制，製成品增加銷路，面獲得更多的利潤，即是俗語所說薄利多銷，經濟更見靈活，物價亦可更趨平衡，國民經濟更可廣大的發展，所以限制物價，對於工廠是有利的。　　工人福利亟需舉辦　　工人因為工資的限制增漲，生活自然不無影響，因此，工人福利事業的舉辦，更是必需的，例如工人消費合作社，工人子弟補習學校，勞工醫院，托兒所，及其他工人娛樂設施，本局都在督促各工廠切實的執行，這也可以使工人的負祖，獲得一部分的减輕。至於日用品之補貼辦法，現在本市已有詳確的規定，本局自當切實執行。　　現在値戰事之餘，根據歷史的慣例，戰事之後，人民都是要忍痛忍苦，渡過這個難關，迎着新的幸福的康莊大道前進。目前的困苦，必須每個人堅守着，忍耐着，才能造成國家復興，民族的上進。希望人民切切實責的擁護這個措施，共同努力道個方案。實物供應辦法公布後　各方反響不一致　　〔本報訊〕本市廠商職工實物供應辦法，經昨日社會局公佈後，各廠商因業務情形不同，反應殊不一致。就記者走訪所及，大率言之，一般論件計酬者，如烟草，橡膠等業勞資雙方尚認為滿意。大部份機器業及百貨業仍感未能滿意，渠等所持理

<p>煤價審議無結果　燃管會對於配煤要漲價　參議會市商會一致反對　　〔本報訊〕煤斤價格審議會於昨日下午假社會局舉行第十次會議。出席社會局顧炳元邵濟華，燃管會李鉅源蔡仁，煤商同業公會鮑哲　　萊魏志大，市商會汪兆虎，參議會姚抱真等。因社會局已擬就監督本市煤號配售一般用戶用煤辦法，故請燃管會將原定配售之八千噸煤早日出貨配予煤商。但燃管會代表聲稱奉經濟部命令，因產地價及運費等皆已增高，故火車統煤每噸廿三萬，同得利小子及長城塊煤每噸卅萬之原配價已不能供應。參議會及市商會代表聞訊一致反對。認為當此政府口口聲聲決以全力抑平物價之際，　營事業不能領導漲儂。煤商方面則表示如配給原料漲價，則煤　門售價亦漲，所漲係加在人民頭上，煤商固無可無不可。但該八千噸煤則為早己運滬者。故所　因遝費漲而加價，殊屬非是。燃管會方面則稱此八千噸煤尚未　予煤商業同業公會，故有漲價之權。參數會市商會堅持反對，爭辯良久，無結果而散。待燃管會代表向主管人員請示後，再作定奪云。　　又訊，最近本市煤價激漲，燃料管理委員會分向越南　　秦皇鳥曁台灣基隆三地趕運煤斤來滬，昨日已有英輪里爾馬勒號，由鴻　運來白煤六千噸，該項白煤為製造煤球之唯一原料。前因越南戰事，來源稍受影響，現由產區運抵海防，待運來滬者頗多，不久均可源源運到。又英輪維許馬勒號，亦於昨日由秦皇島運來巨額煤斤，至台灣方面煤斤，燃料委員會主委徐樂天，日前會赴台灣視察接洽，基隆煤斤亦將大量抵滬，徐氏己由台返滬，於昨晨赴京公幹。准予復業行莊　辦理集中登記　擬向當局洽商救濟辦法　　〔本報訊〕自財政部公告對本市業經核准復業之銀行錢莊，及增設之分支行處，迄至二月二十六日，尚未開業者，其核准原案，即予以撤銷，不得再行開業，本市已領部照，籌備復業之各行莊，大起恐慌。茲悉：該批行莊為謀聯合救濟計，昨起特假本市四川路四九三號，辦理集中登記，以便向當局洽商善後辦法。現聞該批行莊中，正大銀行負責人顧竹洪，已於日前晋京。又匯豐餘銀號·均祥錢莊·大泉錢莊。浙東銀行。愼源錢莊等負責人章人偉。韓志成·等六人，昨日亦已首途晋京，擬向財政部請示救濟或變通之辦法云。　　據銀行商業同業公會某負責人語記者：該公會近日並未召開理事會議。對財部限制復業行莊開業之新辦法，亦迄未接到財部正式訓令。公會方面對各受影響之行莊，當表同情。至加人公會之事，當需視各行莊是否能再與財部治商核准開業而定。公會固並未反對該批行莊入會云。人心咸存奢望　統債又見漲風　　公債昨買風再起，國防會對戰前存款之倍數償付問題，己加研究，引起奢望而見昂，午後塲外更哄高至九千二，統丙晨開六八〇〇元，低價六四〇〇，高至八〇〇〇元而後平，五〇三室六〇四室均進，五五二室三六〇室則出，結果較前收計甲乙各升一千元，丙漲一千三，丁升九百元，戊好八百元，成交約四百萬元。外股轉漲　　外股昨買戶均向橡皮股活動，冷股頗多做開，怡紗晨開後，會低至一五二〇〇元，午刻高至一六五〇〇元，午後轉盤，結果較前收計怡紗英聯會德豐業廣各漲半成強，鋼業獨平，餘均微升。僑匯逐漸恢復　　〔本報訊〕據中國銀行國外部經理陳長桐氏語記者：自外匯率調整後，該行所收僑匯金額，已逐步恢復至去年外匯市塲開放時之情狀。過去僑匯逃避之弊端，刻已見好轉云。米糧市勢平定　　昨南北米市共到一萬五千四百餘石，市勢高貨平定，中下略見修削。白粳十一萬元，薄稻十萬六至八，早稻十萬四，羊秈十萬一至三，白元回降千餘元，陰元平正，秈米仍乏榮辱。麵粉消路不爽，市形軟化，而少神。本粉回低千元，洋粉似昨。麸皮早緊午懈，無甚吸。　　油市升沉互有，生汕去化香燥，挺升三五千元。豆油市化閒散，形趨下游之狀。淸油平平，蔴油立定。豆餅客帮進意冷懈，站平之格。　　黃豆各帮汕廠本街相繼爭購，挺進二千元之譜。綠豆南洋仍然活潑，市面緊俏。赤豆堅定。香港續有問津。　　紅糧依然不振，生仁外埠去胃寥寥，本衛隨之看望，步跌不已，恐難生色，再見狂落萬元。觀豆乏交，一歡不振，續跌萬元。芝蔴議固，苞米酒精去路活跳，價漲二三千元。麵粉調整價格　漲百分之五十　　〔本報訊〕吳市長於昨日下午三時，召集麵粉廠商開會，討論供應配售等問題。由於產區小麥價較滬市為高，致來源短少。加以其他成本等高漲，故決定調整價格，漲起百分之五十，自星期一（三日）起實施。新價為：（一）本粉每包批發價四萬五千元，零售價四萬七千元。（二）七十磅洋粉，每包批發價六萬七千五百元，零售價七萬元。（五）一百磅洋粉每包批發價九萬六千元，零售價九萬九千元　　有關當局並決定調整價格後，在三個月內，不使再有變更。紗市脚地堅定　　〔本報訊〕昨日紗市益臻　境，客帮交易雖屬零星，然市塲生色不少，久未下手之天津帮，昨日對紅魁星亦有納胃，故念支中型紗脚地益見堅定，各支價格，大致與前日行市相仿。　中國紡建公司昨日循例代紡管會售紗，共售二九二三件，內廠商一五〇〇件，紗號一四二三件。申請戶數共五八〇戶，內廠商二六二戶，紗號三一八戶。細布買戶踴躍　　昨日棉布市况：一九〇美亭士林，因現貨充怖，走化呆滯，故塲中做價每疋挫跌八千元，計為卅七萬二千元。其他各色布則平定。細布因紡建公司迭次供售，價格未减，人心再見向榮，且逢低有人收吸，市形堅挺，初開價做十四萬五千元，買戶踴躍，一路上進，最後高至十四萬八千元。五福為十四萬六千五百元。市頗堅穩。茶葉收購價格　央行不願變更　新方案碍難考慮　　〔本報訊〕茶商代表孫曉邨胡陸之二人，昨為卅五年度華茶外銷事，赴中央銀行訪謁業務局長林鳳苞及副局長李筱莊。孫氏等以上次本市茶葉輸出業公會臨時會員大會，議決要求政府按新儂格收購一節，央行表示不能考慮，故昨又提出茶商方面所洽議之書面新方案，決定仍請央行照去年所定收購價格（初期平水茶每担卅三萬元，二期廿七萬五千元，三期廿三萬元，屯錄茶每担四十萬元，祁門茶每担五十萬元），辦理收購，央行須先付價值全部，日後輸出所得利益，則按央行二成茶商八成之比例共分。孫氏等提出該　項方案後，經洽商一過，央行當局仍認為無法考慮。綠央行立塲，認為收購卅五年度外銷華茶，早經雙方洽議成案，彼此且已交換文件，故唯有行收購原案。如輸出後果有利益，其分配辦法，亦應由央行決定云。出口貨結匯打八折　出口業表示反對　決推派代表向央行申述意見　　中央銀行於上月二十八日下午發表規定委託銷售之出口貨物，其外匯依照現行官定匯率一二〇〇〇元折合美金一元，貶價百分之二，予以收購，包括應付運費保險費傭金在內。本市進出口業同業公會特於昨日下午召開出口組會員緊急會議，一致認為央行此項措置與政府獎勵出口事業之原則相左，出口商實無力負担此項損失，當經議決凡在二月二十八日以前報價之出口貨物，已為國外行商承購者，仍以二月二十七之官定匯率結匯，並經推定張耀章周文英等，於四日下午三時向央行請願，晋謁央行業務局負責人林鳳苞，申述該業意見，要求修正。政府收購成品　實行時有困難　　〔本報訊〕自潘議長公展在京發表工業界希望續得生產貸款後，有關人士對記者表示：生產貸款目前並不停止，但要求款項必用於正眞之生產。至於工業界建議由政府收購成品一點，原則無可非議，但實行時有相當困難。第一，成品之種類甚多，如需求甚大者政府自會收購；反之，如用途不大者，收購後亦難於售出，此在戰時生產局時代，即有此種經駝。其次，在生產局時代，往往有借款後不能如期交貨，或出品低劣不能與契的符合者，或製造時忽發現成本過高，又要求重訂價格者。凡此種種，經手者知之甚詳，今日政府如接受「收驟成品」之要求時，凡此均應加以考慮。大批火油到滬　　〔本報訊〕怡和公司外洋部，代理之巴拿馬輪腦利奇號，由美運來火油三萬二千三百餘聽，榮油一千九百餘桶，係德士古公司裝運，該輪泊於德士古碼頭起卸　　〔本報訊〕權威方面消息：國家銀行之存息，決予提高，因目前之官息與自然利率相云過遠，不足以吸收市塲上之游資。如以吸收游資之工作，委之商業銀行時，則商行之間競爭劇烈，存款利率必致大為提高。為求最大之利潤起見，放款利率亦必水漲船高，此與正常工商業之需求，妨害甚大。而在高利率之下，願意借款者必非營業穩健之工商業，而為冒險投機之徒。反之，國家銀行吸收存款後，在放款時並不計較利潤，全視工商業之眞正需要而定。惟國家銀行如欲達到吸收存款之目的，利率勢必大為提高。至於工商界之希望以黃金結售美匯一節，據聞建議之辦法不止一種，目前國家需要外匯頭寸，故此事可加考慮。花貴紗廠　紗廠紡紗虧本　　自政府實施收購紗布政策後，不論國營民營紗廠生產量之一半，均須由紡管會實施收購，二月份收購價，該會已規定二十支紗為二百五十萬元，其他均依此類推，惟紡織業方面表示：因花貴紗綫，仍須虧本。據悉：現在二十支紗之再生產計算成本（除利潤與統稅未列入）净為三·二八六·五三五元，計原料二·一〇〇·〇〇〇元，工資二八〇·〇〇〇元，製造費用五三九·九三五元，業務費八一·六〇〇元，財務費二八五·〇〇〇元，合計共達三·二八六·五三三元云。華股蓄勢待發後市已露鋒芒　　華股昨交易有限，　不脫徘徊，紗花大戶在塲外急補，疲後重振，午後雖告呆滯，但蘊稍於一般心理中之買氣，臨收終於乘勢　起，晨開平疲，開後一五七號即納，遞永紗升至二一二〇元，一三七號八四號一四號一七三號均售，尚有回降，低價退至二〇八〇元，三六號一五七號二二二號一八〇號一〇二號一五五號二三一號紛紛抵補，逐步回升至二一七〇元，一九八號一〇五號逢高尚賣，退至二一三〇元，一四號二二三號二二四號八四號八五號二三五號一五二號九七號一〇二號通袂購買，洪某在塲外有補，遞永紗升至二二二〇元，經過少許盤旋後，九七號二三五號以及塲外仍購，升至二二三〇元，一八〇號二一九號一二號七六號一四一號一三九號一八六號八五號尚有供售，十時半後，又迫低至二一四〇元，四七號一八〇號八四號等進至二二一〇元，而二二二號三六號二一九號尙賣，又退為二一五〇元，四七號一九八號一五二號一〇二號一五五號連袂收購，近午再見穩健，惟高後有浮多脫手，午收轉盤，結果較前收計永紗信和華豐中法漲半成，新華美亞微升，景福獨漲一成弱，遞交計永紗信和華豐景福升半成，美亞新光微升，冷股升降俱見，午後開出雖高二〇七號八四號散多俱賣退至二二一〇元，九七號一八〇號九四號三六號二三一號俱有買胃，又回升至二二五〇元，一四五號四七號六一號二二三連袂脫手，乃將遞永紗迫低至二一七五元，一九八號八四號二一八號一五二號以及檯面俱進，永業由一九八號掛高至漲停，信和亦起漲風，而升至二二五〇元，二二四號七六號一四號二〇三號脫手，仍被壓倒退至二二一〇元，九四號一八八號二一一號一四五號陸續買進，榮　漲停，美亞迫停，傳金價有提高之謠，臨收仍迫高價，結果較前收計永紗信和新光升半成強，中法平，新華微升，華豐漲一成強，美亞漲停有成交，遞交永紗信和新光升半成，美亞半成弱，華學升一成，冷股榮豐永業漲停，餘者升降互見，塲外各股再告下降。英鎊港幣買賣　央行昨正式掛牌　　〔本報訊〕中央銀行昨日起，對英鎊，港幣，羅比等，　之電匯率，正式開始掛牌，茲特探誌如次：　　幣別　買價　賣價　　英鎊　四〇〇〇〇元　四八〇〇〇元　　港幣　二五〇〇元　三〇〇〇元　　羅比　三〇〇〇元　三六〇〇元　　按英鎊電匯率，在未正式掛牌前，原價為實進四七九六〇元，賣出四八三六〇元。此次掛牌價格，業己减低。又上述三種外幣，除英鎊因英政府本有出口禁令，不予收兌外，其他兩種外幣，商人得向指定銀行購進或售出，各指定銀行供應或收進時，其差額不得超過當日中央銀行掛牌價格百分之二。並由中央銀行指定中國·交通·匯豐·麥加利等四銀行辦理收兌事宜云。糖市去化減少　　昨糖市以實銷靜寂，趨勢仍軟。公會劃盤白糖復小數千元，號貨開出亦少。計冲提靑為十三萬五千元，順德靑初開十三萬三千元至十三萬元，後為十二萬六千五百元，成交三百包之譜。興化白高二十萬〇七八千元，興赤十四萬二千元，計百數件，其餘均僅呌價而己。聞客帮續有來電止貨者，可見去化更見减少，後市不易樂觀。人造絲步降　　昨市人造絲因有配售而露頹勢，一二〇號高山有光，開盤喊八百〇五萬元，乏人過問，盤旋下挫，喊到八十萬元收盤，下午人心更虛，實銷戶亦抱觀望態度，致喊價更趨下游，最小做四十五萬元，最後同行互做五十萬元，賣出加十萬元，比上日短去五十萬元，其餘半光等喊價亦跟跌四五十萬元不等。廠經洋行仍無交易，只做開幾担，零担高貨價七百八十萬元，其餘各檔，均乏成交。綢貨昨市仍形寂寥，喊價勉強維持上日原盤，大誠格子璧縐開盤一萬八千元，中間曾喊過七千四百元，卒做上日原價，成交數甚式微，震旦絲織公司格子　縐，昨市成交價做一萬八千元。洋紙買風蓬勃　　〔本報訊〕洋紙買風蓬勃，今市再度上升。加拿大白報紙每令十三萬八千元，較昨市升一萬三千元，續對開報紙每令十二萬元，直劃開報紙十二萬八千元。凡利根白打字紙每令十二萬五千元，38磅道絲紙每令卅萬元，36磅牛皮紙每令卅萬元，熱銷貨一致挺升。僅透明紙·重磅牛皮紙。等無人靑睞，價讀下游。染料客銷仍呆　價格頻頻下降　　〔本報訊〕染料以華北及湘鄂方面運輸阻梗，客帮裏足，市銷亦寄，今市喊價再貶，交易依然稀落。三里灰每聽卅六萬元，三僧元十八萬元，天字快靛五斤聽八百五十萬元，染圖雪靑每聽卅三萬元，獅球硃卅八萬元，皂黃廿二萬元，五馬硃四十萬元，BN·C元十萬元，價均頻頻下降。外銷紅茶昨市續有成交　　外銷綠菜中之珠茶，向受非洲摩洛哥一帶所垂愛。刻下彼地對此項花色，雖極需要，惜給價未能寬裕，致出口依然停滯。惟最近本市某行為展開去路起見，將有數十箱路莊珠茶，自願貶價試運，若能順利進行，日後輸出定屬可觀。其他各茶，猶以抽珍，珍眉，等花色，脫手活躍不表，至於英商出口行所需之紅茶，自日前吐納談判獲得圓滿後，昨日市上續有成交，市氣一致穩定。紅茶內銷，仍鮮起色，甚少精采。菲幣掉換時期　延至昨日截止　　〔本報訊〕關於菲律賓比索，掉換勝利此索事，菲政府原定本年一月三十一日，為截止之期。旋中央銀行以掉換時間侷促，為顧全持有舊比索之僑胞利益計，曾呈請財部轉請外交部向菲政府洽商延期辦法。茲悉：菲政府已允將掉換時期，延長至二月二十八日截止。中央銀行昨特以第八十八號通函，分發各指定銀行查照云。</p>

<p>桂林十二日航訊　廣西口腹地　兩千里去來  本報特約記者梁小中　　春節初度，記者孑然一身，自桂林循桂柳路抵柳州，經遷江，賓陽，轉貴縣，浮鬱水而游桂平，潯江買棹，揚帆東下直達蒼梧，數日盤桓，復輕車奔馳於玉梧公路，過容縣，北流以入鬱林，再轉興業，返貴縣，過賓陽以訪邕寗，由邕而柳，由柳而桂，一月之游，于役行止，足跡遍廣西口腹之地，行經二十餘縣，有的是舊地歸燕，有的是鴻跡初臨，回首征　，靜思聞見，不免要作一個新的紀錄。狂濤中的朽船狂起驟落　　所經過的地方，全部可以說是廣西最富庶的區域，本來多少總應該看得到一點逸樂景象，然而就記者個人觀察所得，却又不外是「田里有飢寒之色，人民有愁苦之聲，」省憂撫慰，尚待從連著手，觀乎聯合國中關於廣四災情的報告，吾人已可欲說無言，勝利快兩年了，老百姓所得又有幾何？　　記者初行之際，亦正金融潮泛之時，到處一看，但意味到廣西恰如在濤中朽船一般，東西漂泊，狂起驟落，距毀滅之境，相去不過一綫之遙。拿物價及人民的生活力一看，便知端詳：從梧州聽到七萬元的米價時，我嚇了一跳，不料五天以後，竟會在南寗啃着十二萬元的米飯一物長，百物漲，沿公路的「伸手將軍」，多到難以勝數。經北流時，飯店因為買不到米做飯而對我們抱歉一句「恕不招待」，此地向有「黃金區」之稱，居然寒酸若此。再看到沿途阡陌上那些重操採樹皮草根「舊業」同胞，從而遙望靑黃不接之期，不禁一頭冷汗農戶種籽無存　仰求市場　　榖子價昂，但是農戶大部連今春種籽都顆粒無存，反而仰求於市塲之中，需求供應的平衡，已經全盤破壞，是則不難想像農村經濟必然的趨向。　　黨天吃飯的人們，雨水不足，便是一個致命的死傷。農曆二月已到，可是沿途田隴猶自荒蕪如恒，耕犁鬆土者十未得一，大家都是「蓋有待也。」不是水，便是錢，不是錢，便是人，萬般辛苦，豈是十兩八兩麵粉所可解決？此次黃旭初主席出巡桂東歸來，談到各地糧食問題或可解決，但願眞有如此一日，何必更假外求？大河輪船　需要實力護航　　各地政治環境，大抵都還單純，盜感之多，固然無可諱言，但是有政治色彩的勢力，倒還不易發現。治安工作未嘗不到家，然而為了外在原因的侵害，所以還有許多地方都還是「治而不安」。譬如說：行走大河輪船，沒有「實力護航」的保證，使難找到一點客貨，甚至汽車司機都得背起槍桿十走路。夜宿野店，槍聲四處，的確使人夢寐不安。最近省治安當局正在進行一决規模空前的淸鄉工作，官兵處處，露布四張，鐵索啷噹蹣跚大路者，日日可見，觀其形而思其由，內心總未免有點說不出的苦痛。　　沿途據調查所得，至十一一月為止，糧賦收到七成者，僅一兩絲，其他大抵尚在四五六成之間，征收的成績不算壞，農戶「拖」的成績亦還可觀，家有兩　者，年收不過一兩担，而征借達九十斤，以至有有自願棄地不耕慘象。學費跟米價走　學生失學　　推開政治，再看一看教育，馬上我便可以告訴你：「廣西的教育隨著米價走」　米價連天的漲，公立學校的經費費了杯水車薪，私立學校一向便是「　宮八字開，有才無米莫進來」。一學期的學費完全要米，三百斤不定，五百斤不定，有幾個學生有米如此？於是結果弄到「學生失學，學費失米一，南一家素負歷史的私立山學，開學了半月多，到我走的時候，只有四個人註册省立學校大都自本期起撥歸縣辦，各縣財力不足，難以負担，不敢接收，弄到學校有如棄婦，狼狽不堪，至今還有多少學校開不了門，說起來質是一塲大笑話，　　行行重行行，一個大　子，又轉回桂林來，空往空返，一無所得，偶然在歸途中想起了十個字：行二里路，整一肚子氣！透視世界原料市場  萊汀十六日航訊　本報特約記者宏負　　本年初之世界原料市塲與貨價，可藉是以默測各國工商事業之興衰，舉其犖犖大者，凡紡織品，糧食，南貨，石油，五金諸部門：　　紡織品　（甲）棉，上年美國棉花收成不甚佳，美政府病棉價之過昂，大加津貼，棉價已被壓低百分之廿，此水平可固定不移，美國上年棉花之收穫，共數八百四十八萬包，比照再上一年所收九百萬包已略少，而比平時產量每年一千二百萬包則更少，美國棉產之消費，每年總需一千萬包，本年之由美出口向外國者，已多至三百萬包，在美存貨，所餘無幾，待新季節到來，存者不滿四百萬包，平昔存貨，則需進備八百萬包之多，以今視昔，尚不滿半數，且今所存，類係在美不易謀推銷之劣貨，困絀可想，美國種棉之地積，上年度為一千八百萬英頃Acres，（每一英頃，等於十分之四公頃，）至下一年，聞須增至二千三百萬英頃，美國以外各地棉之生產量，聞亦加大，一九四六至四七之年內，可望收得一千三百十五萬包，而同年之所消費，則在一千四百萬包以上，供求相較，仍苦不足，統全世界之棉市言，最近一年棉之總產量，約得二千一百五十萬包，而此一年之總消費，却需二千七百萬包，棉之存積日見其稀少，甚且至下一年，或者仍覺存貨之過，下一年即一九四七至四八，至全世界之棉花總消費，或須增加三千萬包矣。　　（乙）羊毛，未施人工之生羊毛，各方需求殊切迫，質佳者新定高價，仍易脫售低質存貨，價已開始下降，製產量與銷費額，不相上下，來年市價，將有不斷低藩之傾向。　　糧食　（甲）以言小麥，澳洲上度之收成不佳，僅達一百二十兆布塞爾，（即半斛，計容二千一百五十立方英寸，等於三十五又四分之一公升，）少期待之數，約短少五十兆布塞爾，本年糧食季節開始之際，萬有之存貨，可資供給者為數甚微，而世界市塲不斷之需求，應比收成所可得之產量，更多百分之十，其於麥產更占重要地位之美國，則在上一年，幸有向所未遇『超紀錄』之夏期收成一千一百六十兆布塞爾正便取以分配給產量减退苦不足之歐洲各地。但歐洲之國家，盡缺美金而手頭苦窘。且如美地之罷工，及海上往還船舶之稀少，盡足阻美麥之源源外運，又美麥之冬收，據其農部之佔計一九四六年多情勢尚更佳，謂可收得九百四十六兆五十萬布寒爾，比諸一九四五年冬收八百七十四兆布爾塞固已加多，而比一九三五至四四前後十年冬收平均數之每年六百十八兆，更為起色。逆料一九四七年之春，美麥大有過剩之可能，而麥價必須下跌，（乙）作飼料之玉蜀黍，上年在美國，亦遇打破歷來紀錄向所未見之豐收，計得三千二百九十兆布塞爾，比諸再上一年之收成，加多二百七十兆布塞爾，南美洲之銀團阿根廷，乃王蜀黍之另一重大出產地，近亦可得甚好之收成，惟均留作自用，對於歐洲各地無關係。　　糖之供給，今已大加增進，巴有　紀錄之收成，據倫敦某糖公司估計，自一九四六年九月起，至一九四七年八月止，最近一年全世界總產量，可得二十六兆六十一萬長噸，比其前一年十二個月全世界總產量二十一兆八十二萬長　，已見增加，雖比戰前產址每年三十兆之平均數，尚形短絀，而以之分配各國市塲，却大有助。　　糖與茶　茶，昔在戰期之中，中國印度錫蘭爪哇各地之茶，盡集中於倫敦，而使高下不同之茶品，混合為一以出售，故價不昂，近來美國於茶，首先豁免分配限制而實行自由貿易，復如戰前，因茶質之不同而分等出售，英印錫蘭之茶循此道，而茶價日漸提高，中國茶之出口向海外，亦以不共他茶混合，而博善價，惟荷印之爪哇，多數茶田，毀於戰禍，損失過大，今尚不能出口。　　可可　可可腦丁文之學名曰天　Theo-brom　，價近加高，因今美國方面，物價管制已豁免，不復有最高價格之法定限制，價可任各方面自由提高，今新產品之上市者，達到平昔所有數量七分之六，即百分之八十五，而尚缺七分一之小數，西非洲可可樹，率遭蟲害，不能出口，乃今市場貨略缺之主要原因。　　咖啡　咖啡，美國如啡市場之物價統制已解放，價漸升高，他國商人求諸中南美，面價仍高，巴西今年之產量，可望有十二兆袋，（每袋六十公斤）而巴西之存貨，近餘六兆袋，平均每一個月所出口者一兆五十萬袋，預期至本年六月，存貨將罄，須待下年新貨出而補足之，目前尚略缺，下年貨可不缺矣。　　油類　一切動植物油，及乾腦，亦尚短缺，菲列濱產椰子得油，今出口，北冰洋有鯨油，英屬東非洲產花生油，北美因多玉蜀黍，可多養豬，而得豬油，丹麥荷蘭多畜牛而產乳油，目前產油最高希望，是為達到戰前原產量三分之二。　　橡膠　英政府為橡膠公賣，損失極大，上年十一月十八日廢除官賣制，人民可自由貿易，此後兩個月之貨物市塲，橡膠之供給加多，至本年一月而市價下跌，統計全世界橡膠產額，得諸一九四六年者一百八十萬噸，其中化學製造之橡膠九十四萬噸，天然產生之貨可出八十六萬噸，此後單就天生橡膠言，一九四七年上市之貨，可加至一百二十萬噸，若迨一九四八年，又可增為一百五十萬噸，通扯在短期內，合天生與人造之兩種，每年產量平均數，總可合成二百萬噸，但全世界人羣得自橡膠之用途，不能太多，一九四六年所消費之一百六十萬，一九四七年之一百七十萬，已踴最高限度，橡膠直到於今尚甚缺，而一兩年之後，或苦過剩。　　石油　石油價向上漲，因製產之成本近較昂，油之用途，日見其增，美國在上一年（一九四六），耗去一千九百三十兆桶Barrels（每桶二百公升）預計一九四七年之一年間，袛美國之一方面，已需用油二百零十兆桶，而今舉世缺煤，盡人改用石油為燃料，此後歐洲所需石油，或須得諸近東之波斯，以及介乎波斯與及之西部亞洲，今有起自西部亞洲產油區，直達地中海岸之石油輸送管，已在裝置中。　　五金類　五金（銅鐵除外）。今為戰後開始復原狀之第一年，全世界錫之產量，一九四六年為九萬五千噸，預計一九四七年，可得十六萬噸，紅銅及鉛狼戾金Woltram（又名鋦），至今猶短缺，鎳之產量，頗敷消費，正惟紅銅及銅俱短缺，代之以興者有人造之鋁Aluminium，鋁之用途與製產，日見甚多，方興未艾。　　其中尤可注意者，北美洲之合衆國，所產原料雖甚多，而其國內各廠之求原料，却至踴躍，往昔他國各有其工廠，美為原料出口之國，冷則美國人爭起設廠，忽變為大宗原料入口之國，且德及日本，今均不需原料入口，昔之成批流入德及日本者，今均往美，是以美國市塲原料之價，時見向上推升。讀者意見規約　　（一）本欄絕對公開，文責自負。但切忌長。（二）切勿攻訐私人，切勿一稿兩投。（三）投稿人須寫明讀者意見稿件，並須舉示真實姓名及地址，但發表時得用筆明。（四）本欄稿件概不致酬。（五）對來稿本報有調節之權（六）來稿披露與否，概不函復。（七）本報於必要時，得將來稿轉致有關機關參考，　　私校渴望配給圖書編者先生：　　前見報載國外捐贈圖書及儀器頗多，有裨干我復興教育甚鉅，但是項圖書儀器之分配，是否限於國立學校無從探悉。但按之國立學校之經費及設備，當然超出私立學校。例如吾母校東南醫學院，俱茄學校，於日寇侵滬時，付之一炬。勝利後亟謀復興，困屬私立，教部未予補助，祗能自力更生動員全體師生，設法勸募及舉債，現雖購得校舍一所而須修理及復興設備，雖經院長張錫琪先生之努力，終難以完成所期望。竊以醫學乃貴乎實習之科學，又為復興建設最重要之部門，故敢向教部建議將捐贈圖書儀器一部份配給各專科以上私立學校以助復興而示普惠。（一個　學生）</p>

<p>春秋	懷孫伏老  魯莽　　春來多感，旣憶蟄居山城的王平陵，便又想起比平陵兄躲得更遠的孫伏園老先生了。紅鼻子下一簇列寧式的鬍髭，矮小精幹的身材，其實曠達異常。孫伏老和別的文人不同，從不發牢騷，又最喜隱於市區。在重慶時和幾個朋友創辦了一個中外出版社，那地方貫通牛角沱上淸寺，紅塵十丈，車馬不絕，要在夏季，允感煩躁，可是伏老安之若素，每天坐在牛角沱的冷酒館裏啜白乾，進花生米，豆腐干，視作稀世之珍　　論副刋，孫伏園與邵力子，這兩位紹興文人，要算是副到的老祖宗了。五四時代邵力子先生編民國日報的「覺悟」，孫伏老編北京晨報的「晨副」，這時副刊界的北孫南邵，宛如那時候共產黨中的南陳（獨秀）北李（大釗），旗鼓相當，各霸一方。邵先生的「覺悟」，得力於國民黨中的靑年作家，那時的國民黨因尚未執政，多少俊彥，都致力寫作，「覺悟」雖係副刋，佳作依然紛紛。晨報副刋，地處五四運動的策源地，後面有北京大學一批新派學者支持，而伏老又係蔡孑民先生的親信，對於佳作，予取予求，錦上添花，難怪不如火如荼，成為副刋界的元老。所以民十六武漢中央日報創世，伏老便被聘為中央副刊的主編，三十一年陳博生主特重慶中央日報，伏老又被聘主持中副，天天埋頭於化龍橋中央日報的油紙窗下看稿子。那稿子擠滿幾桌子，他如何看法，我實在不明白；但伏老對一切是處之泰然的，當然無所謂。可是抗戰中的中副，實在沒有五四時晨副的生動，為這件事我曾經和伏老詳細硏究過，結論：意志集中，思想統一，對政治的貢獻大，蘇維埃共產主義聯邦的成功，便是最好的例子。思想自由，意見分歧，對文化的貢獻大，春秋諸子百家，西洋文藝復興，以及五四運動的蓬勃也便是最好的例子。因此我要寄語伏老，五四自由主義的時代，現在又來了，我並不希望伏老伏處西川，於芙蓉城中，坐小竹椅，擺龍門陣；我依然希望伏老出山，為文藝工作，為靑年工作。　　伏老與魯迅翁有同鄉同事之雅，最認識魯迅，在重慶會出版一本呌做「魯迅二三事」的小册子，內容雖寥寥無幾，却眞切異常。現在的靑年人依然對魯迅有迷信，我也希望伏老來多做一些魯迅硏究的工作，以正確的見解，介紹於新時代中的靑年。　　沉默，應該有時間性，隱居，不是民主時代的辦法，第二個五四到了，我們要創造，創造，不必分老和少！「發牢騷」  胡山源　　牢騷，人人會發，似乎只有文人最會發。因為文人總比別人敏感些，慾望大些，而又因長於文詞，善於形容，於是一講到發牢騷，差不多就成了文人的專利。自從屈大夫作「離騷」大發牢騷以來，一直到現在，幾乎無有一個文人不發牢騷，也幾乎無有一個文人不善於發牢騷的。牢騷與文人簡直混成了一體，於是詩人便稱「騷人」。　　屈大夫的牢騷，以及他的後繼者賈太傅的牢騷，很可以使我們同情。但他們那樣的憂傷憔悴以死，却不能使我們同意。他們是忠君愛國，很想有些作為的；可惜他們早早毀滅了他們的生命，除了留下著作以外，沒有其他成就。這可以稱為屈賈式的牢騷。　　讀過古文觀止的，一定對「李陵答蘇武書」和「楊憚報孫會宗書」這二篇的牢騷印象很深。這都是因待遇不平而發的，他們也可以算為牢騷的正宗，因為牢騷正是由不平而起的。但我却覺得他們徒然多此一舉，不要說楊惲因發此牢騷丟了性命，就是李陵這種自以為受屈的，究竟於人於已又有些什麼好處呢？這可以稱為李楊式的牢騷。　　李楊式當然不及屈賈式，因為李楊只是個人待遇問題，屈賈是有偉大的目的的。但冷觀一般發牢騷的文人，却獨多李楊式的，屈賈式的很少很少，這也許是「一代不如一代」吧！　　蘇東坡的「一肚皮不合時宜」，自然也應該歸入發牢騷之列。不過蘇東坡並不像屈賈的固執，也不像李楊的憤激，也只在有意無意之間，可發即發，不發也就算了。這也許可以稱為詩人式的牢騷，或仍以人為標準，稱為蘇東坡式。　　蘇東坡式的牢騷，我以為是詩人眞情的流露，無所為而為，很得古詩人「哀而不傷，怨而不怒」的宗旨。不過你會不會覺得他未免太消極了些呢？　　一直到現在，文人發牢騷的，大都是名士式的牢騷。所謂名士，就只有個名，士呢，也許為了他們能够讀書識字寫文章，就勉强給了這個名稱。他們絕無別的技能，更無任何學問。但他們却最最自命不凡。他們的眼裏沒有國家社會，沒有任何別的人。他們只有他們自己。他們以為自己是應該享福的，過驕奢淫逸的生活的，換言之，他們相信是應該不勞而獲，如果不是皇帝的大恩，祖上的餘蔭，就應該天下掉下醉酒婦人以及一切享樂的工具的。他們沒有這些，他們也不會求得這些，於是便一天到晚坐着發牢騷，以為國家社會虧待了他，不論那一個人，連家人父子在內，虧待了他，天也虧待了他。他怒；他罵；他哭；他發瘋；他死。並且他至死不悟，以為他是淸高的。有些人也居然稱他的淸高，同情他，哀憐他，而不知他，這種名士式的發牢騷者，其本身就只會發牢騷，此外是眞正「百無一用」的。和李白同時的李赤，就這樣發瘋淹死在毛厕裏，或渚這可以稱為李赤式的牢騷。　　李赤式的牢騷是一些沒有因頭的，就是說，不像別人發牢騷，還有些被逼而不得不然的情形，他們却完全出於自動，往往無病呻吟，不妨誅心一下地說，他們也許覺得牢騷中自有樂地，正在沾沾自喜呢！　　一過江名士多如鯽，「時代究竟已經不同，李赤到底不會有了吧？多出幾個蘇東坡，文學上多留下一些成績，未嘗不好，但這又談何容易呢，不要詩人做不成，還是做了一個名士。並且做詩人，到底也不必一定要會發牢騷吧，西洋的大詩人，似乎就不是個個都以發牢騷起家的。屈賈與李楊，不論他們本身如何，總不容後世的人去學他們。一言以蔽之：發牢騷是無一是處的，文人還是善用其長於其他有益之途，總不要發牢騷！一寸山河一寸血　186  葉勁風　　這是我對戴先生的第一個印象。其他印象，很多很多，類如他有一種威攝人心的氣派，一種呌人敬而愛之的吸引力，一種X光似的注視，照透了你的胸臆；一種不可動搖的堅毅，呌你始終肯信托他；等等，這裘我不願意多所記載。且待後來拿他的行動—在大後方，在八一三後的淪陷區內，在各戰地的前綫尖端—種種行動，來表現他給我們深刻的印象。　　在戴先生發言之後，鶴見恢復了他的常態：　　「到松井那裏去的目標，總算達到了；百分之百的達到了」！　　我聽了鶴見這個報告，心下覺得奇怪了。我最担心事的一件，就怕他在松井那襄，起了衡突，或讓松并發現了我們的隱秘，因而動搖我們現下的工作基礎。如今聽他報告，一點沒有此類的表示，那麼，他又為什麼那等慌張失色呢？「我想請問一句」，鶴見已經恢復了他的北平口音。這時瞧了我們一眼，然後目光集中，落在W君身上：「這裏一共六層樓，除了我們這一層，一切都與外界隔　之外，其餘的幾層，二層到五層的住客，下層的飯客茶客，平日不知道有準確的統計調查嗎」？　　「有的」君一手已經捺鈴喚人了；因為他知道下文需要些什麼參考。　　經過値日員應着給聲的進，退，傳喚，我們面前，在一兩分鐘的短時間之內，已經加入了一位特殊人物，—這座飯店的總經理。他的外表，就如其他北平的飯店經理，或大規模營業的掌櫃一般，撲實，沉着，誠懇，和氣。　　「臨街一層，每天飯局，大約有多少人來往？……有沒有經常來往的長客？」鶴見問。　　經理搯出了隨身的一本小册子，但並沒有展開來看：　　「經常飯局，逢節逢紀念不算，大的七八成座。這七八成裏，可說有九成九是熟客，多年的熟客，根底我們都淸楚。那百分之一，也許就是一兩位小吃的顧客；有的也許來過一决；有的隔些時「回頭」一次。對於這些「回頭」客，我們多少有些紀錄；譬如他們的姓名，職業，住址，來往等等」。　　鶴見的問，和經理的答，呌我們明瞭了問題的中心，從這問題的中心，呌我們立時推想到一個虛構的段落和結論；換句話說，必是鶴見在這一小時內，一進一出的經過上，發現了一件岔眼的事—對W君這個組織的新威脅，一種裏應外合的攻勢，或一種侵入的反抗工作。　　「二到五層的常川寓客呢」？鶴見又問。　　「五層談不到，都是我們自已弟兄。共餘三層，大小共四十二間屋子，常川住客，大的十分之七，來往的十分之二三，空着的十分之一左右。這些來往的，都有調查記錄。常住的這七層裏面，只有三間，比較複雜，但三個屋子裏，我們都裝有偵查設備，他們的談話，動作，都有記錄」。經理像背誦一段熟書似的，一字一字的答着。茶客——揚州續夢之十  洪為法　　　　俗謂揚人喜愛「早上皮包水，晚上水包皮」。「皮包水」是指赴茶社吃茶，「水包皮」則指赴浴堂洗浴。實則喜愛「皮包水」者未必即喜愛「水包皮」的。　　喜愛「早上皮包水」者，多為年紀較老之茶客，不僅早間赴茶社，午後也多是去的。他們每天早間九時左右到茶社，會坐到十一時以後才離開。午後三時以後，便又到了茶社，直待暮色蒼然，這才安步當車的施施歸去。不計寒暑，亦不計晴雨，一年四季的光陰除了睡眠以外，幾乎有一半是消磨在茶社裏的。這類茶客，在過去是極多，近年來却也逐漸的减少。　　他們多集中在極少的茶社裏，如當春茶社即其大木營之一，與其他茶客也顯然有些不同之處。其他茶客雖亦各有其「物以類聚」之所，如錢業常聚於某茶社，米業常聚於某茶社等等，可是都以談行市，講交易為其主要目的，吃茶不過是附帶的行動。他們對於這些茶客是羞與為伍的。他們旣無行市可言，更無交易可講，祇是談談風月，論論國事，又或評評詩文。談談風月，多還說的蘊藉，遂亦無傷大雅。論論國事，有時是感慨，有時也會憤慨。到憤慨時，便會旁若無人，掀髯拍案。茶社主人過去在時局每有突變之時，對於他們這種情態，生恐惹出是非，累了自家營業，會揭貼出「莫談國事」的紅紙條。這對於他們自然是一種警惕，因而在短期問中，也會由放言高論變為附耳過來。可是時間一長，便又故態復萌。雖是旁人敬老尊賢，多可相諒，而在茶社主人總是一件極苦惱的事。至於評評詩文，大多是同輩所作。譬如甲乙丙三人同桌，甲指乙對丙說：「某翁！你讀到他近作某文吧」？丙答：「已經拜讀過了好極好極！此文在歐歸之間」！丙說著點着頭，乙則在一旁　鬚徽笑。於是甲又向丙說。「某翁！我看不僅歐歸之問，簡直是　歐之間」！甲說罷，不禁格格的在笑起來。而此時的乙，則不覺略略抬起身子，向甲丙兩人拱手說：「不敢當！兩位眞是過獎小弟了」！類似這種談話，是常會在他們中間發現的‘有時因評評詩文，又會發生懷舊的情懷。又警如甲乙二人談到詩鐘，都感到今不如昔，於是甲說：「從前的那些特鐘，現在不易再見了，眞是天喪斯文」！乙便接着說：「某翁所論甚是，像從前某老做的詩鐘『三更風雨蒙頭臥，六代湖山把臂遊」這兩句嵌字格，嵌上三頭六臂四字，是如何的工穩，如何的爽利！現在的人那裏能做得出呢」，類似這種談話，也常會在他們中問發現的。　　他們是茶客，也是眞正的茶客。因為茶吃得多，點心却吃得少。早問可以祇吃三四枚包餃，午後可以祗吃兩三枚小燒餅。並且多是記賬，各有戶頭，也各記各賬，除是事前言明，誰都不會虛情假意，搶着做東道主人。這欠賬要到三節才結算，到結算時還可暫不結淸，留些尾款滾到下一節再算。所以吃茶一年，以戰前說，最多不過百餘元，所費無多，自能樂此不疲。　　至於人色方面，其中有貴介公子，有倦遊政客，有落拓名士，也有出身寒微，因有一技之長為大家所激賞，因而厕身其間的。但多是通曉翰墨之輩，因而臭味相投，自易同在另一個境地裏做着與世無爭，也可說脾睨一切的茶客了。游魚  沈樾藝文壇  箴　　出版業去年度以廣益書局獲利最巨，因其大量翻印舊小設及古文四書，頗投小市民之所好故也。　　托爾斯泰名著「復活」（高植譯）及曹禺劇本「家」，售缺已數月，現已由文化生活出版社再版出書。世界古典文學名著，佛洛貝爾之驚人傑作「馬丹波娃利」，為世界不朽之作，其藝術價値遠超托爾斯泰之「安挪·卞列尼娜」，該書為作家書屋出版，定價二萬元。　　盧騷名著「懺悔錄」已由作家嘗屋趕印中，編入「世界古典文學名著」第三種，其另一名著「民的論」，亦由復旦大學敎授衛惠林譯出，由作家書屋印行。此書為民主運動之歷史名著和，於新中國之再建有巨大之帮助。　　作家書屋於勝利後遷滬復業，瞬已一載，茲為優待讀者，於三月一日起舉行特價三天，全部圖書一律八折。　　黃嘉音主編之家庭婦女讀物家雜誌第十四期三月號，已於三月一日出版，封面為白楊女士彩色照片，內容有檀仁梅博士之賢夫良父的基本條件；心波女士之婆媳之間的衝突；黃仁華女士之渡太平洋到美國；陳科美敎授之中國家庭的四化；何淸儒博士之為什麼求業不得；劉本立醫師之當心流產。

<h3>The Supreme National Defense Council Passes the List of All Parties Participating in the Government; The List of the Constitutional Government Promotion Association to be Announced Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] After the lists of the China Democratic Socialist Party and the Chinese Youth Party participating in the four institutions were submitted, the candidates from the Kuomintang and respected members of society were decided at the Provisional Central Executive Committee meeting held on the 26th. The lists of all parties participating in the Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, and National Political Council were approved at the Supreme National Defense Council meeting held at 10:00 AM on the 28th. The list of the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association will be announced by government decree. The list of Kuomintang participants will be finalized after the Chairman's final approval. A summary is recorded as follows: For the National Political Council, the Kuomintang has Zhang Shan and ten others, the Chinese Youth Party has Zhang Zigui and ten others, the China Democratic Socialist Party has Sha Yanxie and ten others, and respected members of society include Ai Shi and ten others, totaling forty-four people. For the Legislative Yuan, the Kuomintang has Zhao Yunyi and sixteen others, the Chinese Youth Party has Liu Dongyan and twelve others, the China Democratic Socialist Party has Zhang Yaodong and eleven others, and respected members of society include Rui Yifu and seven others, totaling fifty people. For the Control Yuan, the Kuomintang has Cao Haosen and eight others, the Chinese Youth Party has Li Buwei and five others, the China Democratic Socialist Party has Huang Renbin and six others, and respected members of society include Xiang Naiqi and two others.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The lists of members of the Standing Committee of the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association and all members of the Investigation Committee, Propaganda Committee, and Research Committee have been submitted by all parties. They will now be sent directly to Chairman Chiang for review and then announced by order of the National Government.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The 57th meeting of the Central Standing Committee was held at 9:00 AM on the 28th in the conference room of the Secretariat of the Central Party Headquarters. The meeting discussed the newly added candidates from the Kuomintang for Legislative Yuan members, Control Yuan members, National Political Council members, and Standing Committee members of the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association. After voting, seventeen Legislative Yuan members, nine Control Yuan members, eleven National Political Council members, and eighty-six Standing Committee members of the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association were selected.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] In the preliminary lists of the China Democratic Socialist Party for the four institutions, the allocation of committee members for the various committees of the Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association has not been finalized. Chiang Yun-tien will take the night train to Shanghai on the 28th to consult with people in Shanghai before submitting the list to the government.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 28th] The National Government will take concrete steps on March 1st to end the Kuomintang's one-party rule of the past twenty years. The Executive Yuan and the National Government Committee will also be reorganized before March 15th. This will end the period of political tutelage under the Kuomintang, as Chairman Chiang has repeatedly promised.</p>
<p>Mr. Zuo Shunsheng Expresses His Thoughts</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Zuo Shunsheng, the propaganda director of the Chinese Youth Party, recently expressed his thoughts on the party's participation in the four government reorganization institutions. Mr. Zuo stated that since the party participated in the National Assembly to jointly formulate the Constitution, it has been determined to further jointly promote democracy and prepare for constitutional governance. This participation in the four institutions is consistent with the spirit of participating in the formulation. Among the four institutions, the National Political Council was originally a public opinion institution created during the war of resistance. Our party proposed its expansion during the Political Consultative Conference and has participated for a long time. This slight increase in the number of people needs no explanation. The Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association was originally decided by the National Assembly. Since we have participated in the National Assembly, it is natural to carry out the work we have decided. However, the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan previously had no participation from parties other than the Kuomintang. This inclusion of people outside the party shows the Kuomintang's determination to end political tutelage. The Legislative Yuan urgently needs to decide on some sub-laws in the Constitution, and it is more appropriate to participate in opinions from multiple parties. The Control Yuan's duty is to rectify officialdom and is directly related to the interests of the people. Absorbing some new viewpoints will undoubtedly help strengthen administrative efficiency. In short, we cannot recognize that the creation and adjustment of these four institutions constitutes a reorganization of the government, but it is not unrelated to the realization of democracy. This can be asserted.</p>
<h3>Xinjiang Ethnic Issues Can Be Resolved After Constitutional Government; Zhang Zhizhong Returns to His Post in a Week</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Zhang Zhizhong visited Chiang Yun-tien at 4:00 PM on the 28th to discuss improvements in Anhui politics. He hosted a banquet for Wu Tiecheng and other dignitaries at 7:00 PM. Mr. Zhang is scheduled to return to Xinjiang in a week.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Our reporter visited Zhang Zhizhong at his residence on the morning of the 28th and had a detailed conversation about the general situation in Xinjiang and Mr. Zhang's activities in Nanjing. The questions and answers are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Question: The general perception is that the Xinjiang issue is complicated, and disputes have occurred recently. What is the truth?</p>
<p>Answer: They have recently made two petitions, the requirements of which are roughly: (1) Regarding personnel issues, they want the authorities to replace the commissioners of certain bureaus; (2) They demand that the post office and telecommunications bureau be changed to provincial operations; (3) Regarding judicial matters, Han Chinese judges should be withdrawn, etc. However, we are determined to adopt a peaceful approach to guide them.</p>
<p>Question: In January of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), President Song proposed to the Soviet side opinions regarding economic negotiations in Xinjiang, but the Soviet side did not respond. During Chairman Zhang's meeting with Soviet Ambassador Petrov in Nanjing, did you exchange opinions on this matter?</p>

<h3>Bevin Expresses Hope in the House of Commons That China Will Recover Soon; British Undersecretary of State Says Trade With China is Difficult</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] Foreign Secretary Bevin expressed in the foreign affairs debate in the House of Commons his sincere hope that the Chinese situation will be resolved soon, so that this great nation, which has long been a friend of the UK, can move towards recovery and prosperity. Bevin said that things like nerve warfare and civil wars are very likely to become major factors contributing to a widespread war. The confrontation of great politicians and the indulgence of force are extremely dangerous weapons in terms of the concept of world peace. He earnestly hoped that politicians would strive to avoid playing with such dangerous weapons for the sake of the people of the world, and stop encouraging them so that the dangerous situation can end. The economic and financial situation in China is deteriorating, mainly due to civil war. I earnestly hope that a solution can be found soon.</p>

<h3>Overview of the Work of the Resources Committee; Qian Changzhao Reports to the Resident Committee of the National Political Council</h3>
<p>Qian Changzhao, the chairman of the Resources Committee, reported on the overview of the committee's work over the past fourteen years at the National Political Council yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. He also clarified that the committee's main task is to follow the Principle of People's Livelihood to develop national capital, and that the biggest prerequisite for developing national capital at present is to promote the construction of basic industries, encourage the free development of legitimate private enterprises, and eliminate the harm of bureaucratic capital. At the end, Qian also presented a report on the projected output of national resources for this year and two years later. The full text is recorded below:</p>
<p>I am very happy to have the opportunity to report to you on the work of the Resources Committee today. Before reporting on the work, I would like to raise a few questions for your advice:</p>
<p>The Correct Path for Economic Construction</p>
<p>First, the whole world is moving forward, and we cannot go backward. There are roughly three paths for economic construction: communism, capitalism, and the Principle of People's Livelihood. Communism seems equal but is very unfree, capitalism seems free but is very unequal, and only the Principle of People's Livelihood combines freedom and equality, and there is no doubt that it is the most correct path. Developing national capital is one of the most important principles of the Principle of People's Livelihood. Its purpose is to realize the ideal of nationalizing capital and enjoying it by the masses. Unfortunately, the Constitution formulated by the National Assembly did not emphasize this. Furthermore, in terms of facts, especially regarding basic industries, private capital in our country will definitely not invest on a large scale in basic industries in the current and recent three to five years, under the circumstances of changing prices and generally high-interest rates. Moreover, foreign capital is hesitant to move forward due to unstable political and social conditions. Unless the government undertakes the responsibility of basic industrial construction with strong confidence and full perseverance, the future is unimaginable, and the original weak foundation will inevitably collapse, and talents will also be lost.</p>
<p>Bureaucratic Capital Harms the Cause</p>
<p>Second, some people in society often raise the issue of the competition between state-owned enterprises and private enterprises. In my view, our country's production is backward, and the strength of the government and the people are very limited. Each can develop freely, and there is no reason for conflict. In the future, we should divide the labor and cooperate with each other according to the entire economic construction plan. Standing on the position of state-owned enterprises, I believe that the government should fully assist all rational and enlightened private enterprises, except for those that only seek profit and disregard the interests of the country and the nation, and for those that are anti-social combinations, such as trusts and cartels, and take measures to prevent them.</p>
<p>Third, recently some people have confused national capital with bureaucratic capital, which is a major error. So-called bureaucratic capital is the use of bureaucratic status to develop their own private capital, which is absolutely opposite to national capital, which belongs to all the people. The harm of bureaucratic capital to state-owned enterprises is no less than its harm to private enterprises. The colleagues of the Resources Committee are very clear about this point, and I can guarantee that the persons in charge of the various enterprises will never abuse their power for personal gain.</p>
<p>Adjusting the Industrial and Mining Power Industry</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the work of the Resources Committee itself. The Huangyuan Committee was established in the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932) and has been in existence for fourteen years. The work in the first three years was limited to investigation, statistics, and planning. Starting in the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), it began to run businesses. After that, it was still able to proceed smoothly according to the established steps. The War of Resistance against Japan broke out in the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), and it had to change its original plan and engage in the dismantling of factories and mines in the war zone and the construction of factories and mines in the rear. During the War of Resistance against Japan, the Resources Committee built a total of 79 units in the rear, including industrial and mining industries and power industries. The distribution of all regions and the types of products were all in accordance with the needs of the War of Resistance. In the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), the War of Resistance was won, and it entered the period of national construction. The focus of the Resources Committee's work was: one was the adjustment of the original industrial and mining and power industries in the rear, and the other was the takeover and reorganization of the enemy and puppet industrial and mining and power industries in the recovered areas.</p>
<p>The adjustment of the original industrial and mining and power industries in the rear has four principles: First, all businesses that are purely to meet wartime needs will be terminated. Second, all businesses that are purely to supply local needs will be transferred to local governments or local people for operation. Third, if the sales of a business's products decrease, but the Resources Committee still needs to continue operating it, it will be appropriately reduced. Fourth, businesses that are of the nature of important basic industries will be maintained and efforts will be made to develop them. As a result of the adjustment, a total of 15 units were terminated, a total of 24 units were transferred to local governments or local people for operation, a total of 4 units were appropriately reduced, and a total of 36 units were maintained and efforts were made to develop them.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Commander Xuan Tiewu of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai Office of the Chinese Communist Party, stating: "To the Shanghai Office of the Chinese Communist Party: It is found that your party refuses peace negotiations, creates internal strife, and incites disturbances and organizes riots in this city. The Military Mediation Department has now been dissolved. In order to ensure security, this Headquarters hereby notifies your party's personnel in Shanghai that they are required to withdraw completely before March 5th. All withdrawing personnel and their dependents are required to submit a list of names to the department for verification before March 3rd. Songhu Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu." (Note: The Shanghai Office of the Chinese Communist Party was established under the name of General Zhou Enlai's residence in May of last year.)</p>

<h3>JINAN OUTSKIRTS TEMPORARILY CALM, SITUATION IN EASTERN SHANDONG BECOMES TENSE, NATIONAL ARMY ENTERS Qufu ON JINPU FRONT</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Qingdao 28th Dispatch] The war in Shandong has extended to eastern Shandong, but the center of gravity has not yet shifted there. Several columns of Communist troops from the north, numbering over 10,000, have been discovered southwest of Jiaoxian and northeast of Zhucheng. The National Army on the Jiaoji Railway is concentrating its forces to intercept and engage the Communist troops scattered in eastern Shandong and those fleeing north.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Xuzhou 28th Dispatch] The National Army advancing north along the Jinpu Railway has united its central and flanking forces into a cohesive whole and is now advancing in a balanced manner. The central units eliminated the resistance of the Communist militia on the evening of the 28th and entered Qufu County. After occupying Feixian County, the right-wing units eliminated the remnants of the Communist New 7th Division in Liangqiu, southwest of Feixian, on the 28th. The left-wing units have reached the vicinity of Wenshang.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] To coordinate with the advance of the National Army on the main front, the National Army in western Shandong has crossed the Grand Canal and is advancing eastward. They reached the outskirts of Wenshang County at noon on the 28th and are expected to enter the city tonight. The Communist troops there are fleeing northeast.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xuzhou 28th Dispatch] The situation outside Jinan has changed. The National Army is tightening its encirclement of the Communist troops in Shandong. The National Army advancing north from Zou County recovered Qufu at 5 PM on the 28th. The Communist troops were routed and fled towards Sishui. Sishui is now under National Army control.

There are now no large columns of Communist troops roaming in the triangular area between the Yellow River and the Grand Canal in western Shandong.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan 28th Dispatch] The situation outside Jinan was quiet from the 27th to noon on the 28th. The Communist troops did not attack, and there were only minor skirmishes. However, Zhangqiu and Mingshui continued to be fiercely attacked, for no more than three reasons: (1) They know that the National Army in Jinan has increased in strength, so they are avoiding the main force and shifting their attack targets. (2) Although the areas retreated from by the National Army have been occupied by the Communist troops, the Communist troops suffered heavy casualties and need to reorganize for some time before attacking again. (3) The National Army is advancing rapidly on the Jinpu Railway, and they will inevitably increase their forces to meet the challenge.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan 8th Dispatch] The situation around Qingdao and the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway is becoming tense. It is reported that since the beginning of spring, the total number of Communist troops transported from Dalian to eastern Shandong has exceeded 50,000. In recent days, another 20,000 fully armed Communist troops, some of whom are Japanese, have been transported from Dalian to Yantai, Weihai, and Penglai, where they have landed with the assistance of military personnel. In addition, four regiments of Lin Biao's troops have fled from Yantai to the Nanhezhen area south of Yexian. The 5th and 6th Divisions, along with artillery units, have fled back from Weihai to the north and south areas of Jiaoxian and Gaomi. It is generally believed that a major battle in the Qingdao area is imminent.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan 28th Dispatch] After inflicting heavy blows on the Communist troops, the National Army at Longshan Station on the western section of the Jiaoji Railway retreated to Guodian Military Station on the 27th and is continuing to inflict blows on the Communist troops. Furthermore, although the National Army outside Jinan is still facing off against the Communist troops on the line of Huanghe, Yancheng, Guodian, Zhonggong, Xiying, Jiujiahua, and Changji on the 28th, it has established contact with the National Army north of Taian and Yuncheng.

<h3>Overview of the Resources Committee's Work, Continued from Page One</h3>
<p>Principles for Reorganizing Enemy and Puppet Industries</p>
<p>There are also four principles for receiving and reorganizing enemy and puppet industries and power enterprises in recovered areas: First, takeover operations should avoid being piecemeal, and should be limited to important basic industries and those that the government deems must be taken over by the Resources Committee. Second, takeover operations should consolidate similar industries in adjacent areas, concentrating manpower and financial resources for unified management. Third, takeover operations should adopt a company system as much as possible. Fourth, the goal of takeover operations is to quickly restore production. As a result of the reception and reorganization, there are a total of nineteen units in the nine northeastern provinces. Because these units were dismantled and relocated by the Soviet Union and damaged by the Communist Party, although work is gradually resuming, active replenishment is still needed. In Taiwan, there are a total of seven units jointly operated by the Resources Committee and the Administrative Governor's Office, and three units exclusively operated by the Resources Committee. During the war, each unit was bombed by Allied aircraft, with average losses ranging from 30% to 60-70%. Except for the copper mine and aluminum industries, which are still in the planning stage, the rest have resumed production. There are a total of twenty-six units in North China, Central China, and South China. Except for coal and steel, where three units are still in the planning stage, the rest have resumed production.</p>
<p>1947 Production Estimates</p>
<p>The Resources Committee was ordered to reorganize and report directly to the Executive Yuan in April of last year. It currently has a total of ninety-five units, with more than 250,000 employees. Each enterprise is moving towards corporatization, adopting a company system as much as possible in its organization, and striving for scientific management. Vertically, responsibility is divided at each level to eliminate the drawbacks of being too large to manage or top-heavy; horizontally, cooperation is strengthened to achieve the benefits of division of labor and cooperation. In terms of technology, the hope is to catch up, both by hiring foreign experts to assist in China and by sending personnel abroad to study. Now, let me briefly mention the estimated output of each enterprise in 1947: (1) Electricity: 724,859 kilowatts. (2) Coal: 7.4 million tons. (3) Steel: 99,000 tons of iron and 106,000 tons of steel products. (4) Petroleum: 22.83 million gallons of gasoline, 9 million gallons of kerosene, and 310 million gallons of diesel fuel. (5) Metal ores: 7,500 tons of tungsten sand, 5,000 tons of antimony, 2,650 tons of tin, 2,300 tons of copper, 660 tons of lead, 60 tons of zinc, 4,200 tons of aluminum, 12,500 taels of gold, and 100,000 taels of silver. (6) Machinery: 6,000 horsepower of power machinery, 110 machine tools, 2,000 tons of operating machinery and parts, 10 locomotives, 480 freight cars, 2,000 tons of shipbuilding, and 150,000 tons of ship repair. (7) Electrical engineering: 100,400 horsepower of electrical machinery, 47,800 kilovolt-amperes of transformers, 117,400 coils of electrical wire, 300 transmitters and receivers, and 2.5 million insulators. (8) Chemicals: 31,000 tons of acids and bases, 57,600 tons of fertilizer, and 2.5 million gallons of power alcohol. (9) Cement: 340,000 tons. (10) Sugar: 100,000 tons. (11) Paper: 27,000 tons. The total production value for 1947 is estimated to be approximately 2,350 billion yuan, of which approximately US$20 million can be exported to earn foreign exchange. In the future, reconstruction work can utilize Japanese compensation equipment and seek to purchase equipment from abroad. As long as the situation is relatively stable, it should not be difficult to complete the initial stages by the end of next year, and production should be greatly increased starting the year after, with a large portion being completely self-sufficient.</p>
<p>1949 Possible Targets</p>
<p>Here are the targets for 1949 that are more likely to be achieved, for reference: (1) Electricity: 1.1 million kilowatts. (2) Coal: 15.3 million tons. (3) Steel: 500,000 tons of iron and 500,000 tons of steel products. (4) Petroleum: 182 million gallons of gasoline, 51 million gallons of kerosene, and 109 million gallons of diesel fuel. (5) Metal ores: 11,000 tons of tungsten, 10,500 tons of antimony, 5,700 tons of tin, 2,500 tons of copper, 4,000 tons of lead, 200 tons of zinc, 18,000 tons of aluminum, 57,000 taels of gold, and 255,000 taels of silver. (6) Machinery: 40,000 horsepower of power machinery, 2,000 machine tools, 10,000 tons of operating machinery and parts, 72 locomotives, 2,000 freight cars, 110,000 tons of shipbuilding, and 1.3 million tons of ship repair. (7) Electrical engineering: 440,000 horsepower of electrical machinery, 450,000 kilovolt-amperes of transformers, 760,000 coils of electrical wire, 2,600 transmitters and receivers, 6 million insulators, and 150,000 radio receivers. (8) Chemicals: 120,000 tons of acids and bases, 260,000 tons of fertilizer, and 13.32 million gallons of power alcohol. (9) Cement: 1.7 million tons. (10) Sugar: 600,000 tons. (11) Paper: 60,000 tons.</p>
<p>Slight Surplus in Past Revenue and Expenditure</p>
<p>In summary, the importance of state-owned industries and power enterprises in national production can be seen. The Resources Committee's expenditure, on average over the years, is less than 2% of the total national budget, which is insufficient for developing basic industries. At a time when the country's finances are difficult, we can only do our best to promote state-owned enterprises within the scope of what is possible. The original purpose was not to make profits, but the revenue and expenditure over the years have been able to offset each other, with a slight surplus, all of which has been turned over to the treasury. Although this provides a basis for the development of state capital as indicated by the Principle of People's Livelihood, it is still far behind the advanced countries of the world. It is imperative to establish an economic policy centered on production and to coordinate financial and monetary policies with it, so that it can flourish and complete the task that basic industries should have in national construction. I hope that you gentlemen will give us more guidance and assistance. (End)</p>
<h3>Luo Junqiang's Treason Case Concluded After Trial; Still Attempting to Evade Responsibility After Being Interrogated for the Fourth Time Yesterday; Closing Arguments Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled for the 6th</h3>
<p>[Nanjing, February 28th, this newspaper] Luo Junqiang, the traitor, was interrogated for the fourth time at 10:00 a.m. on the 28th, and still attempted to evade responsibility for everything he had done in the past. After the closing arguments began, Luo recited his prepared defense statement, filled with phrases such as "eager to serve the country" and "my heart can be judged by heaven and earth," which were chilling to hear. When he read the line "a broken heart harbors other feelings," laughter could be heard in the courtroom. Later, lawyer Duanmu Kai also stood up to defend him, hoping for a lenient sentence. The arguments concluded at 12:30 p.m., and the court announced that sentencing would be on March 6th.</p>
<p>Today's trial of Luo was presided over by Judge Luo Yunxie of the Second Criminal Court of the Nanjing High Court, with judges Ge Zhaotang and Li Huaian serving as jurors. After the court was convened, various pieces of evidence were examined. Luo not only refused to admit to the various corrupt practices during his tenure as chairman of the puppet Anhui Provincial Government, but also considered them to be "virtuous policies" that benefited the people, speaking with a sense of pride. Subsequently, prosecutor Wang Wenjun detailed Luo's various crimes, arguing that Luo had held important positions in the government during the early stages of the war of resistance, yet shamelessly served the enemy, which was unforgivable. Luo then responded with ten reasons, shifting responsibility and arguing that although he had "mingled with" the collaborators, he had not been "tainted" by them. Lawyers Wang Shanxiang and Duanmu Kai also successively defended Luo from the perspectives of law and human sentiment. Wang argued that Luo was only a mid-level official in the puppet government and not a key figure, requesting a lenient sentence of life imprisonment, and pointed out that Luo had assisted in the war of resistance, hoping for a reduced sentence. Duanmu Kai, in his dual capacity as defense counsel and friend of Luo, explained that Luo had been extremely patriotic during the early stages of the war of resistance, and although he later left Chongqing due to personal reasons, he had absolutely no prior plan to join the puppet government. Luo's various actions after joining the puppet regime could prove that he "had no intention of colluding with the enemy, but rather had the reality of opposing the enemy." Finally, prosecutor Wang sternly refuted the arguments, and the closing arguments concluded. The court announced that sentencing would be on March 6th.</p>
<h3>Tragedy in Fancheng While抢领购盐凭证; Six People Trampled to Death, Fourteen Injured</h3>
<p>[Hankou, February 28th, this newspaper] It is reported that a tragic incident occurred in Fancheng on the 17th while trying to obtain salt purchase certificates, resulting in six deaths and fourteen injuries, all of whom were of prime age. In the midst of rising black market salt prices, salt merchants suddenly became active. At 7:00 a.m. that day, more than 3,000 salt merchants from the cities of Xiangfan and nearby counties gathered at the Fancheng branch of the Hubei Salt Affairs Office to collect salt purchase certificates. The crowd was so crowded that they pushed and shoved each other, resulting in the aforementioned deaths and injuries from trampling. Various agencies and organizations rushed to investigate, and local reporters went to take photos, but they were stopped by police sent by the salt affairs authorities. Therefore, the details of this tragedy have not yet been fully revealed. It is also widely rumored in Hankou that the Salt Affairs Bureau has privately allocated large quantities of salt to salt merchants, causing widespread complaints about the salt sales methods.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Deadline for the Withdrawal of CCP Personnel</h3>
<p>The government has already instructed security agencies across the country to pay close attention to the safety of the personnel of the CCP offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing as they return to Yan'an before March 5th. The local garrison headquarters has also received this instruction and formally notified the Shanghai CCP office yesterday. The issue of the withdrawal of CCP personnel arose long ago after the United States announced the abandonment of its mediation efforts. However, the government authorities have repeatedly tolerated this, hoping that the CCP would one day see the light and lay down their arms. Therefore, there has been no concrete decision made on this matter. However, over the past month, the CCP bandits have rejected any restoration of peace talks, and have launched large-scale offensives on all fronts, from northern Jiangsu to southern Shandong, and from southern Shandong to central Shandong, almost launching a full-scale rebellion. In recent days, the Northeast is also brewing a large-scale battle. This terrible trend is sufficient to prove that the current CCP problem is no longer a party dispute. The wars in central Shandong and the Northeast are by no means conflicts between the CCP and the KMT, but rather a rebellion by the CCP that endangers the country. Therefore, the CCP today is no longer comparable to an ordinary political party, and cannot enjoy the rights that a legitimate political party should enjoy in politics. If the CCP is not a legitimate political party, how can the personnel of the CCP offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing be allowed to remain in place?</p>
<p>Let us review the various activities carried out by the CCP personnel in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing, and it will not be difficult to see that these CCP personnel are simply engaged in activities that harm the country and the people. The government allowed the CCP to establish offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing in order to facilitate peace talks. However, in reality, the establishment of the CCP offices in the three cities has not only been unhelpful to the peace talks, but has been harmful. During the process of the peace talks, the CCP offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing have almost become the CCP's main base for launching propaganda warfare, with inaccurate reports and irresponsible remarks, doing everything possible to maliciously slander the government, and even obstructing the progress of the peace talks. All of these have been released from these three offices. After the peace talks stalled, the work of these three offices has become even more active. Taking Shanghai as an example, the work of the CCP personnel has always focused on the following two goals: (1) Inciting labor unrest to plunge society into a state of chaos, thereby suppressing the people's morale. When workers can no longer be used, they change their tactics and use "patronizing domestic goods" as a smokescreen, attempting to incite anti-American sentiment among the public. The incident at the Trade Union Building was created in this environment. (2) Disrupting the financial system and accelerating the bankruptcy of the national economy in order to achieve their goal of "promoting the collapse of the domestic economy." The CCP's forces, mixed in with the recent surge in gold prices and stirring up trouble, are also considerable. This newspaper's editorial has long pointed out that this gold rush contains political factors, which refers to the CCP. In order to ensure local peace and stability and the well-being of the people, how can the government allow CCP personnel to continue to undermine security and disrupt the financial system within the government's jurisdiction?</p>
<p>The national policy adopted by the government after the victory has been repeatedly declared by our national leader. In short, it is peaceful unification. This is also what our people have been yearning for day and night. However, peace must be complete, and unification must be even more complete. In the past, in order to achieve domestic peace and unification, the government did not hesitate to compromise and negotiate with the CCP, always hoping to resolve the CCP issue peacefully through political means. However, after more than a year of repeated concessions, the CCP has still failed to wake up from its delusions, resulting in talks and fights, fights and talks, and wasting more than a year's time. In the end, the peace talks stalled and could not be resumed. Although the government still hopes that the CCP can come to its senses, put down its arms, and achieve peace throughout the country, it must faithfully fulfill its responsibilities to the nation and the people when the CCP remains obstinate. At present, the CCP is not only attempting to seize territory by force, but also harbors the ambition to seize power by force. The government cannot fail to take decisive measures to achieve the early realization of domestic peace and unification. Therefore, the national army is on the front lines, whether in northern Jiangsu, southern Shandong, central Shandong, western Shandong, eastern Shandong, or northern Shandong, and will resolutely strike back against any offensives launched by the CCP in order to shatter the CCP's delusions of seizing power by force. The regaining of Linyi is the best lesson for warmongers. Now that the situation has developed to this point, the government naturally does not need to shy away from seeking domestic peace and unification through military force. Emergency measures have been implemented in the economy; it is also necessary to implement other important measures in the military, especially regarding the deployment of troops, which cannot be openly left to CCP personnel to gather intelligence. Moreover, most of the CCP personnel are skilled intelligence workers, and cannot be allowed to remain within the government's jurisdiction.</p>
<p>From the above, it goes without saying that CCP personnel should return to Yan'an from Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing. However, the CCP spokesperson in Yan'an has also made a statement on this issue: "The establishment and existence of the CCP offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing were previously requested by the government and the United States, and permitted by the government. Their task is to liaise with various parties at home and abroad, including the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Unless the government decides that it will no longer negotiate from now on and formally notifies the CCP to withdraw these agencies, or the CCP decides to withdraw them, there is no reason to cancel them." The CCP spokesperson's statement seems plausible on the surface, but it is actually a great error. First, the restoration of peace talks is deadlocked due to the CCP's refusal. Since the CCP is unwilling to negotiate with the government, what is the use of leaving this liaison agency? Second, the battles on the front lines are all caused by the CCP's offensives. Since the CCP is determined to seize power by force, it loses its status as a legitimate political party and cannot retain its offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing, nor can it enjoy the rights that a legitimate political party should enjoy. The Beijing Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, and the Farmers' Association recently issued a declaration demanding that the government prohibit CCP personnel from enjoying human rights. Third, the United States' abandonment of its mediation efforts is also the inevitable result of the CCP's anti-American movement. The Military Mediation Department has long been closed, and the CCP no longer needs to liaise with various parties at home and abroad.</p>
<p>In short, the government has always been lenient towards CCP personnel and can be said to have exhausted all means of tolerance. CCP personnel must know that a political party that resorts to armed rebellion and harms the country and the people has no legal standing in any democratic country. Now, the Nationalist government can still take into account the safety of CCP personnel, and although they are limited to returning to Yan'an before March 5th, they are still being protected, which can be said to be extremely lenient. Therefore, we hope that CCP personnel can also understand the government's good intentions, and when withdrawing, do not engage in destructive actions that harm our people.</p>

<p>[United Press International, Washington, February 27th] President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall held a highly secretive meeting with congressional leaders at the White House today to discuss the United States' foreign policy. It is rumored that Truman solemnly pointed out to Republican and Democratic congressional leaders that Marshall needs to carry a "big stick" when attending the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. It is understood that all those attending the White House meeting solemnly pledged not to divulge the details of today's meeting beyond the broadest issues. However, based on Truman's invitation to Senator Bridges, Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, to attend today's meeting, it is widely believed that defense spending was within the scope of discussion. It is rumored that Truman believes that China's recent budget dispute may lead to speculation by the Soviet Union that the United States has exposed weaknesses in its army and navy plans. According to reliable sources, Truman explained the subtlety of the Moscow meeting to those in attendance and the necessity of avoiding excessive cuts in army and navy budgets. According to Senator Vandenberg, the meeting was merely a broad discussion of foreign policy issues and European issues included in the Foreign Ministers Conference. When asked by reporters whether he was optimistic about the Foreign Ministers Conference, Vandenberg replied, "I have said all I can say, no more."</p>
<p>Pay Attention to the Situation in Greece</p>
<p>[This newspaper] San Francisco, February 28th broadcast: President Truman held a secret meeting with congressional leaders yesterday, with the focus of discussion being how to support Greece in resisting the intrusion of Soviet forces. The reason is that Britain is currently unable to support Greece alone and will inevitably withdraw its troops stationed in Greece. Last year, Britain spent 60 million pounds in Greece, but due to domestic economic difficulties, it will be forced to abandon its interests in Greece. It is widely believed that if the United States does not continue to support Greece after Britain, then this only Balkan country that has not been invaded by Soviet forces will inevitably be forced to break away from Western democracy.</p>
<h3>Bevin Plans to Propose Four-Power Pact to Maintain European Peace at Foreign Ministers Conference</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, February 27th] The House of Commons began its foreign policy debate today, with Foreign Secretary Bevin reviewing general foreign policy issues. It is said that Britain is eager to establish a four-nation pact to maintain peace in Europe. This issue will be discussed at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, and Britain will support the United States' proposal to conclude a four-nation pact for a period of 25 years to ensure the disarmament of Germany. Although the United States and Britain have had misunderstandings over the Palestine issue, they remain united, and the relationship between the United States and Britain is extremely close. Britain will not allow any force to intrude and harm the relations between the two countries. As for the Anglo-French alliance, it is hoped that it will be signed soon. According to reliable sources in Paris, Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault are scheduled to sign the agreement next Wednesday at a location on the French coast. The proposal for the United States, the Soviet Union, France, and the United Kingdom to conclude a 25-year mutual assistance agreement was put forward by former US Secretary of State Byrnes at a peace conference last April. It stipulates that the four powers will continue to occupy Germany for 25 years after the current military occupation of Germany ends. Bevin said that this proposal should be included in the agenda of the Moscow conference. It is truly remarkable that the United States is so closely involved in maintaining peace in Europe. Britain's policy towards Germany seeks local decentralization and economic unity.</p>
<p>First Batch of British Representatives Depart for Moscow</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, February 27th] The first group of twelve members of the Moscow delegation left London by special plane today for Moscow to make arrangements. Foreign Secretary Bevin will lead the remaining hundred members of his entourage, along with twenty British and foreign journalists, and fifteen members of the US delegation, to cross the sea from Calais, France, and take a special train through Belgium, Germany, and Poland.</p>

<h3>Handling of Palestine Issue Awaits Agreement with Britain</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 27th] Regarding the United Kingdom's proposal to convene a special session of the United Nations to discuss the Palestine issue, United Nations Secretary-General Lie has informed the British government of material difficulties. The British government immediately responded, deciding within two weeks whether to convene a special session. It is generally believed that the British government may decide to wait until the United Nations General Assembly convenes in September of this year before submitting the Palestine issue for discussion at the General Assembly.</p>
<h3>Ruhr Industrial Area: War's Root Lies Dormant</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 28th] Robert, Deputy Governor of the British occupation forces in Germany, recently told the press: The Ruhr area, in terms of its structure, may always become a source of war. Currently, there are 1.5 million tons of coal in Ruhr coal mines. British authorities hope to use this coal to supplement Germany's almost completely destroyed industrial equipment.</p>
<h3>Greece Demands Annexation of Cyprus Island</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 28th] The Greek Political Committee recently decided to request that Parliament vote on annexing the island of Cyprus to Greece. Cyprus is a British island territory in the Mediterranean.</p>
<h3>"Ambassador Spy" Case in Poland: Three Main Culprits Executed</h3>
<p>Implicates British Ambassador to Poland, Bentinck</p>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 27th] The main culprits in the sensational "Ambassador Spy" case, Grocholski, Bakzak, and Barycki, were executed today by firing squad. President Bierut refused to grant clemency to the three convicts. The defendants were accused of acting as liaisons between a certain foreign ambassador and the Polish underground movement. That ambassador was the British Ambassador, Bentinck. Mr. Bentinck has already been transferred to another position and is scheduled to leave Poland next week.</p>
<h3>Purge of Japanese News Media: Allied Headquarters to Strictly Enforce</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 28th] Allied Headquarters spokesman Mr. Macken stated at a press conference for Japanese journalists today: They cannot hope for lenient punishment for unnecessary Japanese journalists.

<h3>France's Post-War Population Decreases by Over One Million</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris Airmail] According to a survey conducted on March 10, 1946, the total population of France is 40,517,923, a decrease of over 1,389,000 compared to ten years ago. The populations of the largest cities have all decreased; Marseille decreased by 30%, and Paris decreased by 4%.</p>
<h3>Britain Accuses Albania of Laying Mines: Security Council Establishes Investigation Team</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 27th] The United Nations Security Council decided today to establish a three-nation team to investigate Britain's accusation against Albania of laying mines. Prior to this, there was a two-hour debate on whether the Soviet Union could exercise its veto power. The voting result was nine to zero against the veto, with the Soviet Union and Poland abstaining.</p>
<p>Immediately after the vote, the organization of the team was discussed, which took another hour. Finally, Australia, Colombia, and Poland were designated to form the team. The Soviet Union insisted that Poland should participate in the team. Soviet representative Gromyko argued that establishing the team was a matter of substance, not procedure, so the veto power should be exercised, but no one seconded the motion. Gromyko finally stated that he would waive the right to vote but insisted on retaining the right to object. The team should submit a report on the investigation by the 10th of next month. The team is scheduled to meet on the 30th of next month. Representatives from Colombia and Poland stated that the case is likely to be submitted to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for adjudication. Britain accuses Albania of laying mines in the Corfu Strait, causing two British destroyers to be damaged by mines on October 22 of last year. Britain demanded an apology and compensation, but Albania ignored it, so Britain filed a complaint with the Security Council.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government to Reduce Staff by Half Based on Organization Regulations Passed by the Executive Yuan: Municipal Council Resolves to Telegraph President Song, Stating Further Contraction is Difficult, Requests Dispatch of Personnel for Inspection Before Making a Decision</h3>
<p>The organizational regulations of the Shanghai Municipal Government have been passed by the Executive Yuan. According to reliable sources, the formal order has not yet arrived at the Municipal Government. The amended new organizational regulations have been brought to Shanghai by personnel from the capital. According to reporter inquiries, the content of the amended organizational regulations involves reorganizing the original eight bureaus and six departments of the Municipal Government into nine bureaus and three departments. Among the nine bureaus, in addition to the original eight bureaus of Finance, Social Affairs, Public Works, Public Utilities, Land Administration, Police, Education, and Health, the Civil Affairs Department will be reorganized into the Civil Affairs Bureau. Among the original six departments, only the Secretariat, Statistics, and Accounting Departments will be retained, in addition to the Civil Affairs Department being reorganized into a bureau. The Personnel Department is stipulated to be reorganized into a Personnel Office. The Information Department has no legal basis and will be abolished. It is also stipulated that there will be four to six councilors. As for the bureaus, it is stipulated that there will be no deputy directors or commissioners, and the administration will be changed to a two-level system, abolishing the establishment of departments. Each bureau is stipulated to have three to five sections directly under the control of the bureau director. Each bureau is only allowed to have one secretary holding a senior position, with the rest holding recommended positions. According to the current Municipal Government and the original number of personnel in each bureau, there are 3,354 people, including 125 holding senior positions, 680 holding recommended positions, 2,016 holding appointed positions, and 533 employees. If the new organizational regulations are followed, more than half of the staff will be reduced, especially those holding senior and recommended positions. Moreover, the original number of sections in each bureau ranges from 14 in the most to 6 in the least. If the regulations for downsizing and merging are followed, there will also be many mergers.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The detailed situation of the new organizational regulations of the Municipal Government is as follows: The original number of personnel in the Municipal Government and each bureau is more than 3,300. After the reduction and merger, only more than 1,900 people can be retained. The original 120 sections will be reduced and merged into 48 sections. Among them, only more than 500 section members can be retained from the original 900. Currently, the number of personnel in each bureau ranges from more than 270 to more than 470, but the new organizational regulations limit the number to just over 100. The number of secretaries must not exceed four at most.</p>
<p>[Our Report] During the 68th municipal council meeting held by the Municipal Government yesterday morning, the Executive Yuan's routine meeting passed the contraction of the city's municipal district as reported in the newspapers, and medical issues were discussed. According to relevant sources, during the meeting, everyone believed that the central government could not clearly understand the actual situation in the locality. The Municipal Government's establishment had been contracted again and again. The work of each bureau and department was very busy. If the reduction was carried out according to the central government's regulations, the work would not be able to proceed, and there would only be a collective resignation. Later, Mayor Wu stated that the Municipal Government had not yet received the official document, and opinions could be submitted to the Executive Yuan. It was decided yesterday to immediately telegraph President Song, stating that since Mayor Wu took office, the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government had been greatly contracted compared to before. Later, the Council decided to hold a meeting, and it was reduced by 80%. During the second meeting of the Council, there was a proposal for contraction. The Municipal Government had difficulties in fact, so it asked the Council to send personnel to inspect the Municipal Government in person. The result was that there was no room for further contraction. Therefore, although the Executive Yuan had passed the draft for reduction, please consider the special circumstances of Shanghai and the economic turmoil and social disorder in recent days, and reserve it. Please also ask the Executive Yuan to send personnel to Shanghai for on-site inspection before making a final decision.</p>
<p>Moreover, reporters visited various relevant parties yesterday and stated that the Executive Yuan's official document had not yet arrived at the Municipal Government, and this news may not be completely reliable, especially the abolition of the Personnel Department and the Secretariat. According to Article 83 of the Constitution, the duties of the Personnel Department include examination, qualification, performance appraisal, grade salary, promotion, security, commendation, bereavement, retirement, and old-age care. The work is already very busy at ordinary times. After the establishment of the Public Employee Food Ration Committee, the work will be doubled, and it is difficult to reduce it. According to the current organization of the Municipal Government, each bureau has a personnel office, and each affiliated agency has a personnel administrator. If the current Personnel Department is reduced to a Personnel Office, and the Personnel Office of each bureau is reduced to a Personnel Administrator, what will the Personnel Administrator of the current affiliated agency be called? Moreover, the Municipal Government's Personnel Department was previously submitted to the Examination Yuan and forwarded to the National Government for record, which is directly under the central government, and it seems impossible to abolish it.</p>
<h3>Economic Investigation Network Begins Operations: Four Agencies Responsible for Comprehensive Monitoring; General Report on Thorough Investigation of Gold Rush to be Drafted</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Economic Supervision Group's thorough investigation of the gold rush officially ended yesterday. The entire blacklist and general work report have also been drafted. Special personnel will be dispatched to the capital to submit them to Chairman Chiang for review. The number and identity of the people on the blacklist cannot be released until the Chairman approves them. However, it is reported that more than 40 people are listed on the list. The list details how the individuals engaged in speculation and manipulation and is accompanied by reliable evidence. It is unknown whether there are any "big tigers" involved. According to related sources, there are fewer than 10 people who are qualified as "tigers." By their identity, most of them are "officials and businessmen intertwined" or have strong backgrounds. There are also some pure civil servants, including Zhao Pei, the director of the Qinghai Provincial Government's office in Beijing. There are no soldiers. The highest amount of speculation and manipulation is said to be no more than 5,000 taels. How these people will be dealt with in the future will be executed by the Songhu Garrison Command upon order.</p>
<p>The Economic Supervision Group will no longer be used in name from today, but the economic supervision work will continue to be carried out. The only difference is that the centralized public activities will be transformed into a secret "economic investigation network" that is scattered and dense, and each unit forming the Economic Supervision Group will be responsible separately. In the future, the city's economic supervision work will be carried out in four aspects: (1) Yu Chao's affairs will be the responsibility of the police bureau. (2) The factory side will be the responsibility of the Garrison Command. (3) The bank and money house side will be the responsibility of the Central Statistics Bureau. (4) The general price aspect will be the responsibility of the Military Statistics Bureau. If anyone is found to be engaged in speculation, manipulation, and hoarding, they will be dealt with by the Garrison Command.</p>
<p>[Another Report] After the end of the Economic Supervision Group, the unfinished matters concerning the investigation of production loans to various manufacturers will be continued by the Ministry of Finance and the Four Allied Headquarters. As for Sun Zixin, the owner of Xinda Yarn House, who was ordered to be wanted by the Economic Supervision Group, it is said that he has fled to Hong Kong to hide. In addition, the Huangzhong Company purchased gold bars from "Tongfeng" House, which was mistakenly recorded as "Tongfengyu" yesterday.</p>
<h3>Economic Supervision Group Announces End; Commander Xuan Issues Statement</h3>
<p>The work of the Municipal Economic Supervision Group to suppress past financial turmoil has come to an end today. The name of the Supervision Group has also been cancelled. From now on, the Songhu Garrison Command will be responsible for directing the military and police at any time to assist in the effective implementation of the economic emergency plan and prevent the recurrence of economic turmoil. The reporter asked Commander Xuan Tiewu about the work of the Economic Supervision Group in the past ten days, and he gave a statement as follows: "Shanghai is the economic center of the country, and a slight move can affect the whole body. The central government decided to take action because the price of gold bills was stimulating a general rise in prices, which was a phenomenon created since the victory. At that time, people were panicked and unable to live in peace, as if a great disaster was about to come. The Japanese took the security as a matter of concern and immediately ordered the police and constitution to conduct strict investigations. Then, they received the Chairman's instructions to thoroughly investigate speculators, manipulators, and hoarders. In a few days, the economic emergency plan was promulgated. With the efforts of all parties, the prices in this city gradually returned to normal. All the colleagues who participated in the economic supervision work worked hard day and night and made some achievements. As of today, the work can be said to have come to an end. From now on, the military and police agencies in this city can still be responsible for promoting the methods stipulated in the price control and economic emergency plan. As for the person in charge of this turmoil, the bank and money house side will continue to be thoroughly investigated by the Ministry of Finance, and the production loan part will be responsible for investigating the Central Bank's Audit Department. The rest who are found to have major suspicions can be reported to the higher authorities for approval today on a special case basis. In short, the unfinished work of this group has been continued by the competent authorities, and there is no need to continue to exist, so it is appropriate to end it in time. I sincerely hope that the emergency plan promulgated by the central government will be actively promoted, and there will be no more financial turmoil or price stimulus to stabilize people's livelihood."</p>
<h3>Zheng Jiemin Visits Mayor Wu</h3>
<p>General Zheng Jiemin, who was ordered by the central government to come to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the gold rush, visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government at around 11:00 a.m. yesterday for half an hour. The inspection work of the gold rush case has come to an end, and General Zheng will return to the capital to report. According to relevant sources, Zheng's visit to Mayor Wu was to say goodbye to Mayor Wu.</p>
<h3>Taishan Stock Purchases and Hoards Gold Bills; Transferred to District Procuratorate Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Taishan Stock was found to have purchased and hoarded more than 80 gold bars and more than 20,000 US dollars by the Economic Supervision Group and was transferred to the District Procuratorate yesterday morning on charges of disrupting finance. The prosecutor will summon its manager Chen Keda to the case for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Shipping Industry Plans to Adjust Freight Rates; Sends Representatives to Petition in the Capital</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipowners Association convened a general meeting of members the day before yesterday to discuss ways to save the shipping industry crisis. A unanimous decision was made: (1) to implement comprehensive joint operations, coordinate the allocation of routes, and thoroughly save shipping costs; (2) to adjust freight rates to maintain special shipping costs, and to send representatives to the capital to explain the actual difficulties and the necessity of adjusting freight rates to the Ministry of Communications and the Executive Yuan. The representatives left for the capital last night. At the same time, Xu Xueyu, the general manager of the state-run China Merchants Bureau, and Hu Shiyuan, the deputy general manager, have also been summoned to the capital to report on the actual situation of the shipping industry.</p>
<h3>Gasoline Panic Eliminated; Rationing Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Because the supply and demand of gasoline at gas stations in this city was abnormal, Asia, Mobil, and Texaco decided to adopt a quota distribution system at the request of the Public Utilities Bureau. All vehicle owners in the city were notified to register from February 22, and it was originally scheduled to be implemented today. Now: The gasoline panic has been eliminated, and there are fewer congested gas stations. Therefore, with the consent of the Public Utilities Bureau, the oil company authorities have decided to temporarily suspend the old rationing method. Currently, it can still be freely filled, but all applications for registration will be retained so that they can be implemented at any time if a panic occurs again.</p>
<h3>Emergency Measures to Ban Opium; This City Strictly Implements</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang is very concerned about the opium ban in Beijing and Shanghai and has issued a severe order. After receiving the order, the Shanghai Municipal Government ordered the police bureau to discuss seven emergency measures with Liu, the special commissioner for opium suppression from the Ministry of Interior: (1) Those who have not been investigated among the registered opium addicts will be summoned by the police bureau for investigation. (2) The Health Bureau will announce the list of hospitals responsible for opium addiction investigations. (3) Those who still need opium detoxification after investigation will be sent to the court for severe punishment. (4) Order each police sub-bureau to step up the detection of opium addicts and opium trafficking agencies. (5) The police bureau will consult with military and constitutional personnel to strengthen inspections at land, sea, and air terminals to prevent opium from being transported. (6) The Civil Affairs Department will order the chiefs of districts, guarantees, and captains to seriously review and thoroughly report. (7) The public is welcome to report, and generous bonuses will be given. According to Fang Zhichao, director of the Administrative Department of the Municipal Police Bureau and chief executive of the Opium Eradication Association of this city: The above methods have been separately ordered to be implemented.</p>
<h3>Telephone Collection of Telegrams to be Trialed Today: Limited to Current Fee Telegrams for Now</h3>
<p>The International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications in this city has been ordered to trial the business of notifying and collecting telegrams by telephone from today. Senders who live in fixed locations can notify the station to send personnel to collect urgent, ordinary, and slow current fee international telegrams by dialing 1120 between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. every day. Accounting telegrams will not be applicable to the telephone notification and collection method for the time being. In addition, in order to facilitate the sending of telegrams by the public, the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has also been ordered to trial the "telephone notification and collection of telegrams" from today. If the public wants to send telegrams, they can notify the General Business Office of the bureau at No. 70 Fuzhou Road (telephone 13059) of their address (domestic telegrams are temporarily limited to the current fee urgent telegrams and express telegrams) by telephone. The office will assign an external telegraphic assistant to come to the address to collect the telegram, and all fees payable will be calculated and collected by the telegraphic assistant on the spot, and a telegram receipt will be issued.</p>
<h3>Taxi Prices: 9,000 Yuan for 20 Minutes; Tram and Bus Prices Have Not Increased</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to Zhao Zengjue, director of the Public Utilities Bureau, he told reporters: It is absolutely not true that trams and buses will collectively increase prices by themselves from today. Public utilities are not allowed to adjust prices without the approval of the bureau.</p>
<p>Various taxi companies have increased prices by 100% without authorization, from 6,000 yuan to 12,000 yuan per 20 minutes. From today, the bureau will strictly ban it. The Public Utilities Bureau has approved taxi prices to increase by 50% from March 1, charging 9,000 yuan per 20 minutes.</p>
<h3>Director Wu's Statement: Hoping Citizens Will Overcome Difficulties Together</h3>
<p>A Vicious Cycle of Prices and Wages Must Be Suppressed Simultaneously; This is the Only Measure to Avoid an Unprecedented Crisis</p>
<p>Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, recently made a statement on the issue of prices and wages, with some elaboration. The original words are as follows:</p>
<p>The central government has formulated an economic emergency plan and stipulated that it will be strictly implemented in Beijing and Shanghai. In this plan, the points concerning prices, wages, and the supply of daily necessities are within the scope of the bureau's responsibility in the Shanghai area. I will further explain it again.</p>
<p>The increase in prices is due to the lack of materials. The formation of the lack of materials is due to the fact that the order has not been fully stabilized, resulting in inconvenient transportation and difficult transportation, and goods cannot flow freely. This is the most important reason. On the other hand, because of the abundance of hot money, speculators manipulate and fuel the increase in prices. In the industrial sector, because of the increase in prices, the cost of living index of workers has increased, the cost of manufactured goods has increased, and prices have increased in a cycle. Therefore, prices and wages have become mutually causal and become a cyclical upward phenomenon. Prices and wages are always competing, and the ultimate result will inevitably form a huge crisis. To solve this crisis, we must first stop the vicious cycle of prices and wages and stop their competition. Therefore, the suppression of prices and wages must take a unified chain approach. This plan decides to stabilize prices and limit wages at the same time, taking the cost of living index in January as the standard. This is naturally the only appropriate measure at present.</p>
<h3>Emergency Measures, About Two Purposes</h3>
<p>The central government's measures aim to assist the development of production enterprises and maintain the stability of the lives of workers and the people. Some people may think that limiting prices will affect the development of production enterprises, and limiting wages will affect the lives of workers. In fact, this view is not accurate. Because if prices are not suppressed, prices will always rise in a straight line, wages will increase, costs will increase, and the prices of raw materials will increase. Because of the high prices, the people's lives will be depleted, and sales will be reduced. The factory's manufactured goods will not be able to meet the needs of production and consumption, resulting in the accumulation of goods and no one cares. Over time, it will inevitably tend to decline.</p>
<p>On the worker side, because prices are always increasing, the factory's goods lack sales, which will inevitably lead to the closure of the factory, causing serious unemployment panic for the workers. Both the factory and the workers will perish. Therefore, the factory and the workers must understand this principle and jointly support this policy, so that production can be increased and prices can be reduced, which is a proper way.</p>
<h3>Small Profits and Quick Sales are Beneficial to Factories</h3>
<p>On the raw material side, because the general price is generally reduced, producers can naturally reduce their selling prices. Moreover, the government is also trying to unblock the source and crack down on hoarding and speculation, which are all factors that can reduce raw materials and costs. In addition, the government strictly controls foreign exchange, the cost of foreign goods is increasing day by day, and consumers will inevitably adopt more domestic goods, and sales will be more prosperous. That is, because the price is limited, the manufactured goods increase sales, and they get more profits, that is, the so-called small profits and quick sales. The economy is more flexible, prices can be more balanced, and the national economy can be greatly developed. Therefore, limiting prices is beneficial to factories.</p>
<h3>Worker Welfare Needs to be Organized Urgently</h3>
<p>Workers will inevitably be affected by the limitation of wage increases. Therefore, the organization of worker welfare undertakings is even more necessary. For example, worker consumer cooperatives, worker children's refresher schools, labor hospitals, nurseries, and other worker entertainment facilities are all being urged by the bureau to be effectively implemented by various factories, which can also reduce part of the worker's burden. As for the method of subsidizing daily necessities, there are now detailed regulations in this city, and the bureau will definitely implement them effectively.</p>
<p>Now is the time after the war. According to historical practice, after the war, people have to endure pain and suffering to overcome this difficulty and move forward to the new happy and prosperous road. The current hardship must be adhered to and endured by everyone in order to create national rejuvenation and national progress. I hope that the people will effectively support this measure and work together on this plan.</p>
<h3>After the Promulgation of the Food Supply Method, Reactions from All Parties are Inconsistent</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the Social Affairs Bureau announced the food supply method for manufacturers and workers in this city yesterday, the reactions from various manufacturers are very different due to different business conditions. As far as reporters have visited, generally speaking, both labor and management in industries such as tobacco and rubber, which are generally paid by the piece, are still satisfied. Most machine and department store industries are still not satisfied. The reasons they hold are that the labor side believes that there is no distinction between the advantages and disadvantages of technology, and there is no distinction between technicians and apprentices. The subsidies are the same, which is unfair. The management side believes that there is no separate subsidy for the diligence, laziness, efficiency, or inefficiency of employees, which is a loss of the meaning of rewards and punishments. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions is unwilling to express its views on this. The association is scheduled to hold a board of directors meeting this afternoon to discuss.</p>
<h3>Ban Changing Salary Increase Under a Different Name, Chamber of Commerce Informs Various Industries to Comply</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has been approved by the Municipal Government to ban the creation of allowances in addition to the basic salary as a disguised increase in the basic salary. It has specially informed the trade associations of various industries to order their members to strictly comply.</p>
<h3>Two Labor Unions Petition, Hope for Freezing of Cost of Living Index</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The newspaper industry trade union in this city sent representatives to submit a presentation to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, requesting to unfreeze the cost of living index.</p>
<p>Moreover, more than 10 representatives from the Fourth District Machine Industry Trade Union in this city, including Xu Binggeng, Chen Baolian, and Wang Zuhui, also petitioned the General Federation of Trade Unions yesterday, requesting that the government be requested to unfreeze the cost of living index and stabilize the lives of workers. They submitted three written opinions on the food ration method. Shui Xiangyun, chairman of the General Federation of Trade Unions, promised to submit the various suggestions made by the representatives to the meeting of the board of directors of the General Federation of Trade Unions this afternoon for discussion.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Officially Announces Average Price Difference of Daily Necessities</h3>
<p>72,965 Yuan, Generally Issued at 73,000 Yuan</p>
<p>[Our Report] The average price difference of six kinds of daily necessities for employees in January and February was officially announced by the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday: a total of 72,915 yuan. Because the calculation of the fractional number is troublesome, it was decided that the actual distribution would be calculated at 73,000 yuan. In this way, every employee whose salary is calculated based on the cost of living index, in addition to the salary they should receive in February, which is calculated based on the worker's 7,945 times the cost of living index in January and the employee's 6,614 times, the factory will also subsidize each person with 73,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The calculation of the average price difference of daily necessities for employees is the responsibility of the Municipal Government Research Office. The detailed list of the price difference between January and February is as follows:</p>
<h3>Municipal Finance New Budget, Council Budget Committee, Requests Municipal Government to Re-compile</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Budget Committee was held at the Secretariat in Fuming Village at 4:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss the budget for this year. More than 10 people including Xu Yongzuo, He Yuanming, and Wei Fu Jiu attended. Min Xiangfan, the director of the accounting office of the Municipal Government, also attended. The committee has tried several times to adjust tax revenue, and the difference with the original budget is close to only more than 40 billion yuan. However, recently, due to the adjustment of foreign exchange rates, various bureaus and offices need to add new budgets of more than 1,800 yuan, and the current total difference is more than 220 billion yuan. Therefore, the current budget cannot be compiled at all, and the Municipal Government is requested to recompile the budget for review. This issue will be decided at a joint meeting of the Finance and Budget Committee on March 3.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Tax Revenue Has Not Decreased, Banquet Tax Shortfall of 500 Million</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The tax rates for entertainment tax and banquet tax in this city have been reduced since February. It is reported that the revenue from entertainment tax in the first half of February of the Finance Bureau was more than 1.55 billion, and the estimated total revenue for February can reach 3.1 billion, which is equal to the revenue in January when the tax was not reduced. The main reason is that the police bureau allowed each theater to add seats during the Spring Festival. The revenue from banquet tax in the first half of February was more than 800 million, and the estimated total revenue for the whole month was 1.6 billion, which was more than 500 million less than in January.</p>

<h3>Council General Meeting Changed to 6th</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The second general meeting of the Municipal Council was originally scheduled to be held on May 5 of this month.

<h3>Embezzlement of Loan Incident, China Trust Bureau Did Not Sue</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The incident of embezzling the loan from Tongfengxiang, which occurred in the China Trust Bureau in September last year, has not been resolved so far. The China Trust Bureau handled the acceptance of the 30 million yuan of the National Trust Bank in accordance with normal procedures. It is deeply regrettable that there has been an accident. In order to clarify the credibility of the staff, the entire file was sent to the court for investigation on the 18th of this month to clarify the truth. However, it is not true that the China Trust Bureau sued Tongfengxiang.</p>
<h3>China Training Corps Students, Two Grand Meetings in Beijing and Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Alumni Association of the China Training Corps recently received a telegram from the Nanjing China Training Corps, inviting them to send personnel to participate in the celebration meeting held by the Shanghai students at the Four Sisters Restaurant at 5:00 p.m. today.

<h3>Child Killed by Bus</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At 5:40 p.m. yesterday, at the intersection of Zhonghua Road and Old West Gate, bus No. 37799 on Route 6 knocked down a child over ten years old due to the driver's carelessness.

<h3>China Merchants Bureau Steaming Han Tugboat Damaged on the Jiangmian in Liuhekou</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The China Merchants Bureau's Minzi No. 133 tugboat steamed to Han yesterday morning after the repair work was completed. Unexpectedly, the machinery suddenly broke down on the Jiangmian in Liuhekou. After receiving the report yesterday evening, the bureau plans to send the Guokang tugboat to rescue it.</p>
<h3>Embezzling Public Funds for Interest Case, Wu Suiren Sentenced to Eight Years</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Wu Suiren, the chief of the cashier section of the Executive Yuan, was sentenced to eight years in prison for embezzling 2.7 billion yuan of public funds for profit. After the public prosecution was filed by the District Procuratorate, the District Court held several hearings, and the debate ended. The verdict was announced by Shao Renjie, the judge of the Criminal Court I of the District Court yesterday afternoon. The main text of the verdict is: "Wu Suiren shall be sentenced to eight years of imprisonment for engaging in profit-making in the affairs under his supervision and deprived of his civil rights for eight years." The reasons for the verdict are roughly: "The defendant has already admitted the facts of the crime, which is also consistent with the testimony of the witnesses. The defendant argued that he surrendered himself and that the purpose of the loan was to start a small loan business, which is unfounded and not credible. However, the defendant returned all the public funds after the crime, so the sentence is light."</p>
<h3>Ship Repair Shop Dismisses Employees, Social Affairs Bureau Mediation Fails to Compromise</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The China Merchants Bureau's First Ship Repair Shop dismissed more than 100 workers. The Social Affairs Bureau convened both parties for mediation yesterday. The labor side demanded that the shop withdraw its decision. As a result, the shop believed that technicians and others could be given work, but 54 small workers still had to be dismissed. The dismissal fee salary is one month. The workers believed that they could not be satisfied and insisted on resuming work as a whole, and gathered this morning to petition the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>Procuring Prostitutes for Haircuts; Planned to Earn Cigarettes</h3>
<p>[Our Report] At around 10:00 a.m. yesterday, at Yongtai Tobacco Shop, No. 591 Zhengzheng East Road, Huang Zaiqing, an apprentice from the Mei Sheng Barber Shop at No. 621 next door, accompanied a customer, about 30 years old, who spoke fluent Mandarin, of medium build, wearing glasses on his nose, wearing a blue bottom with black striped woolen suit, and a black coat, purchased ten cans of "3-5 Brand" cigarettes and one carton of "Six Roots". After packing, he wrote a note, instructed the shop apprentice to go to the barber shop with the Mei Sheng apprentice to get money from his wife, and then hired a streetcar to leave. After the two apprentices asked a shampoo girl for money, the girl was at a loss. It is said that she is a prostitute named Xu Sannan, 20 years old, from Suzhou, living at No. 10, Lane 401, Zhengzheng East Road. She was called to the hotel by the guest the night before and spent 42,000 yuan on the night, and went to the Mei Sheng Barber Shop to wash her hair with her in the morning. When she arrived at the door, she shook hands and said goodbye, and was not his wife. The tobacco shop then realized that it had been deceived and reported to the Songshan Branch Bureau for arrest.</p>
<h3>Fudan University Teachers and Students Launch Rights Protection Movement</h3>

A huge slogan was hung at the gate of the school, which read: "Advocating international interference is a traitor." It is heard that this movement will soon receive a</p>

<p>Essays	Remembering Mr. Sun in Retirement  Rude</p>
<p>Spring brings many feelings. Having remembered Wang Pingling, who secluded himself in a mountain city, I then recall Mr. Sun Fuyuan, who hid even further away than Pingling's elder brother. Beneath his red nose, a cluster of Leninist-style whiskers, a small and wiry figure, yet exceptionally open-minded. Old Man Sun differed from other literati in that he never complained and loved to hide in urban areas. In Chongqing, he and a few friends founded a Sino-Foreign Publishing House. That place connected Niujiaotuo and Shangqingsi, amidst the dust and noise of constant traffic. In summer, it was truly annoying, but Old Man Sun remained calm, sipping white liquor and munching peanuts and dried tofu in a small tavern in Niujiaotuo, regarding them as rare delicacies.</p>
<p>In terms of supplements, Sun Fuyuan and Shao Lizi, these two Shaoxing literati, can be considered the ancestors of supplements. During the May Fourth era, Mr. Shao Lizi edited the "Enlightenment" section of the Republican Daily, and Old Man Sun edited the "Morning Supplement" of the Beijing Morning Post. At that time, Sun in the north and Shao in the south of the supplement world were like Chen (Duxiu) in the south and Li (Dazhao) in the north of the Communist Party, evenly matched and each dominating their own territory. Mr. Shao's "Enlightenment" benefited from young writers in the Kuomintang. Because the Kuomintang had not yet come to power, many talented individuals dedicated themselves to writing. Although "Enlightenment" was a supplement, it was filled with excellent works. The Beijing Morning Post supplement, located in the birthplace of the May Fourth Movement, was supported by a group of new scholars from Peking University. Moreover, Old Man Sun was a confidant of Mr. Cai Yuanpei, giving him free rein to select and polish excellent works. No wonder it flourished and became a veteran in the supplement world. Therefore, when the Wuhan Central Daily News was founded in 1927, Old Man Sun was hired as the chief editor of the central supplement. In 1942, when Chen Bosheng was in charge of the Chongqing Central Daily News, Old Man Sun was again hired to host the central supplement, burying himself daily under the oil paper windows of the Central Daily News in Hualongqiao, reading manuscripts. The manuscripts piled up on several tables. I really didn't understand how he read them, but Old Man Sun handled everything with composure, so naturally, it didn't matter. However, the wartime central supplement was not as lively as the Morning Post supplement during the May Fourth era. I once discussed this in detail with Old Man Sun. The conclusion: concentrated will and unified thought contribute greatly to politics; the success of the Soviet Union is the best example. Freedom of thought and divergent opinions contribute greatly to culture; the flourishing of the Hundred Schools of Thought in the Spring and Autumn period, the European Renaissance, and the May Fourth Movement are the best examples. Therefore, I want to tell Old Man Sun that the era of May Fourth liberalism has arrived again. I do not wish Old Man Sun to stay in western Sichuan, sitting on a small bamboo chair and gossiping in Chengdu. I still hope Old Man Sun will come out of retirement and work for literature and art, for the youth.</p>
<p>Old Man Sun and Mr. Lu Xun had the elegance of being from the same hometown and colleagues. He knew Lu Xun very well. In Chongqing, he published a booklet called "Anecdotes of Lu Xun," which, although brief in content, was exceptionally authentic. Young people today still have a blind faith in Lu Xun. I also hope that Old Man Sun will do more research on Lu Xun, introducing him to the youth of the new era with correct insights.</p>
<p>Silence should be time-limited, and seclusion is not the way in a democratic era. The second May Fourth has arrived. We must create, create, regardless of age!</p>
<h3>"Complaining"  Hu Shanyuan</h3>
<p>Everyone can complain, but it seems that literati are the best at it. Because literati are always more sensitive and have greater desires than others. And because they excel at writing and are good at describing, complaining has almost become the exclusive domain of literati. Since the time of Qu Yuan, who wrote "Li Sao" to express his grievances, almost every literati has complained, and almost every literati is good at complaining. Complaining and literati have become almost inseparable, and thus poets are called "lamenting men."</p>
<p>Qu Yuan's complaints, and those of his successor Jia Yi, can easily evoke our sympathy. But we cannot agree with their sorrowful and haggard deaths. They were loyal to their ruler and loved their country, and wanted to achieve something. Unfortunately, they destroyed their lives early, leaving nothing but writings. This can be called Qu-Jia-style complaining.</p>
<p>Those who have read Selections of Ancient Prose must have a deep impression of the complaints in "Li Ling's Reply to Su Wu" and "Yang Yun's Letter to Sun Huizong." These were both caused by unfair treatment, and they can be regarded as the orthodox complaining, because complaining arises from injustice. But I feel that they are just making unnecessary efforts. Not to mention that Yang Yun lost his life for complaining, what good did Li Ling, who thought he was wronged, ultimately do for himself or others? This can be called Li-Yang-style complaining.</p>
<p>Li-Yang-style is certainly inferior to Qu-Jia-style, because Li-Yang is just a matter of personal treatment, while Qu-Jia has a great purpose. But looking coldly at the complaining literati in general, there are many more Li-Yang-style than Qu-Jia-style. Perhaps this is because "each generation is not as good as the last"!</p>
<p>Su Dongpo's "a bellyful of unsuitability" should naturally also be classified as complaining. However, Su Dongpo was not as stubborn as Qu-Jia, nor as indignant as Li-Yang. He would complain intentionally or unintentionally, when he could, and if not, he wouldn't bother. This may be called poetic complaining, or still using the person as the standard, Su Dongpo-style.</p>
<p>I think Su Dongpo's complaining is a true expression of the poet's feelings, done for no reason, and it embodies the ancient poet's principle of "sorrow without injury, resentment without anger." But don't you think he's a bit too passive?</p>
<p>Until now, most of the complaints made by literati are of the type of celebrated scholars. The so-called celebrated scholars only have a name. As for "scholar," perhaps they are barely given this title because they can read, write, and write articles. They have absolutely no other skills and no knowledge whatsoever. But they are the most self-important. They have no country or society in their eyes, no one else. They only have themselves. They think they should enjoy themselves and live a life of luxury. In other words, they believe they should get something for nothing. If not for the great grace of the emperor or the legacy of their ancestors, then drunken women and all the tools of enjoyment should fall from the sky. Since they don't have these and they can't get them, they sit around complaining all day long, thinking that the country and society have treated them unfairly, that everyone, including their family and children, has treated them unfairly, and that even heaven has treated them unfairly. He is angry; he scolds; he cries; he goes crazy; he dies. And he never realizes until his death that he is pure. Some people actually call him pure, sympathize with him, and pity him, but they don't know him. These celebrity-style complainers can only complain and are truly "useless for everything else." Li Chi, who was contemporary with Li Bai, went crazy and drowned in the toilet. Or perhaps this can be called Li Chi-style complaining.</p>
<p>Li Chi-style complaints are groundless. That is to say, unlike others who complain because they are forced to do so, their complaints are completely voluntary. They often groan without illness. It may be a bit harsh to say, but they may feel that there is joy in complaining and are complacent!</p>
<p>Once across the river, celebrities are as numerous as carp. "The times are ultimately different. There won't be any more Li Chis, right? It wouldn't be bad to have a few more Su Dongpos, leaving more achievements in literature, but how easy is that? If you can't be a poet, you become a celebrity. And after all, you don't necessarily have to be good at complaining to be a poet. It seems that not all the great Western poets started out by complaining. Qu Yuan and Li Yang, no matter what they themselves were like, should not be emulated by later generations. In a nutshell: complaining is useless in every way. Literati should make good use of their strengths in other beneficial ways and never complain!</p>
<p>One Inch of Land, One Inch of Blood  Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>That was my first impression of Mr. Dai. Other impressions are many, many, such as that he has a commanding presence, an attractive power that commands respect and love, an X-ray-like gaze that penetrates your mind; an unwavering determination that makes you always willing to trust him; etc. I am not willing to record too much about these things. Let's wait and use his actions—in the rear, in the occupied areas after August 13th, and at the forefront of various battlefields—to express the deep impression he gave us.</p>
<p>After Mr. Dai spoke, Tsurumi recovered his usual state:</p>
<p>"The goal of going to Matsui's place has finally been achieved; 100% achieved"!</p>
<p>I felt strange when I heard Tsurumi's report. The thing I was most worried about was that he might have conflicts at Matsui's place, or that Matsui might have discovered our secrets, thereby shaking our current working foundation. Now, listening to his report, there is no indication of anything like that. So, why was he so flustered?</p>
<p>"I would like to ask a question," Tsurumi had already recovered his Beijing accent. He glanced at us at this time, and then focused his gaze on Mr. W: "This is a six-story building in total. Apart from our floor, everything is isolated from the outside world. Do the guests on the other floors, from the second to the fifth floor, and the diners and tea drinkers on the lower floors, have accurate statistical surveys on weekdays?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Mr. W had already pressed the bell to summon someone; because he knew what kind of reference information would be needed in the following passage.</p>
<p>After the on-duty staff member responded with a sound, entered, retreated, and summoned, a special figure had joined us in a short time of one or two minutes—the general manager of this hotel. His appearance was like that of other hotel managers or large-scale business owners in Peiping: simple, calm, sincere, and amiable.</p>
<p>"On the street-facing floor, how many people come and go for meals every day? ... Are there any regular customers who come and go often?" Tsurumi asked.</p>
<p>The manager took out a small notebook from his pocket, but did not open it to look at it:</p>
<p>"For regular meals, not counting festivals and anniversaries, it's about seven or eight full. Among these seven or eight full, it can be said that 99% are regular customers, many years of regular customers, and we know their backgrounds clearly. That one percent may be one or two customers who eat a small meal; some may have only come once; and some will "return" once after a while. We have some records of these "return" customers; for example, their names, occupations, addresses, comings and goings, etc."</p>
<p>Tsurumi's questions and the manager's answers made us understand the center of the problem. From the center of this problem, we immediately deduced a fictional passage and conclusion. In other words, Tsurumi must have discovered something unusual during his trip in and out within this hour—a new threat to Mr. W's organization, a coordinated attack from within and without, or an invasive resistance work.</p>
<p>"What about the permanent residents on the second to fifth floors?" Tsurumi asked again.</p>
<p>"We can't talk about the fifth floor, they are all our own brothers. The remaining three floors have a total of forty-two rooms, with permanent residents occupying about 70%, those coming and going accounting for 20-30%, and vacant rooms accounting for about 10%. These coming and going people all have investigation records. Among the seven permanent residents, only three rooms are more complicated, but we have installed detection equipment in all three rooms, and their conversations and actions are recorded," the manager answered word by word, as if reciting a familiar passage.</p>
<p>Tea Drinkers——Ten Chapters of Continuing Dreams of Yangzhou  Hong Weifa</p>
<p>It is commonly said that people in Yangzhou love "skin wrapping water in the morning and water wrapping skin in the evening." "Skin wrapping water" refers to going to a teahouse for tea, and "water wrapping skin" refers to going to a bathhouse for a bath. In fact, those who love "skin wrapping water" do not necessarily love "water wrapping skin."</p>
<p>Those who love "skin wrapping water in the morning" are mostly older tea drinkers, who not only go to the teahouse in the morning but also in the afternoon. They arrive at the teahouse around nine o'clock every morning and sit there until after eleven o'clock before leaving. After three o'clock in the afternoon, they arrive at the teahouse again, staying until twilight, and then leisurely return home on foot. Regardless of cold or heat, rain or shine, they spend almost half of the year's time in the teahouse, except for sleeping. This type of tea drinker used to be very numerous, but in recent years they have gradually decreased.</p>
<p>They are mostly concentrated in very few teahouses, such as the Dangchun Teahouse, which is one of their major camps, and they are also somewhat different from other tea drinkers. Although other tea drinkers also have their own places where "birds of a feather flock together," such as those in the money business often gathering in a certain teahouse, and those in the rice business often gathering in a certain teahouse, etc., their main purpose is to talk about market conditions and discuss transactions, and drinking tea is just an incidental activity. They are ashamed to associate with these tea drinkers. They have no market conditions to speak of, nor do they have transactions to discuss. They only talk about romance, discuss national affairs, or comment on poetry and prose. Talking about romance is mostly done implicitly, so it is not too harmful. Discussing national affairs sometimes involves feelings and sometimes indignation. When they get indignant, they become oblivious to others, stroking their beards and slapping the table. In the past, whenever there were sudden changes in the situation, the owner of the teahouse, fearing that their behavior would cause trouble and harm his own business, would post red paper strips saying "Do Not Discuss National Affairs." This was naturally a warning to them, and as a result, in the short term, they would change from speaking freely to whispering. But after a long time, they would relapse into their old habits. Although others respect the elderly and value virtue and are mostly understanding, it is always a very distressing thing for the owner of the teahouse. As for commenting on poetry and prose, it is mostly about the works of their peers. For example, three people, A, B, and C, are at the same table. A points to B and says to C, "Old man, have you read his recent work?" C replies, "I have already read it! Excellent, excellent! This article is between Ou and Gui"! C nods as he speaks, while B smiles slightly to himself. Then A says to C, "Old man! In my opinion, it is not only between Ou and Gui, it is simply between Ou and "! After A finishes speaking, he can't help but laugh. And at this time, B can't help but slightly raise his body, and say to A and C with cupped hands, "I dare not! You two are really overpraising me"! Similar conversations are often found among them. Sometimes, commenting on poetry and prose can also evoke nostalgia. For example, A and B are talking about poem clocks, and they both feel that today is not as good as yesterday. Then A says, "Those special clocks from the past are not easy to see now, it is truly a loss to culture"! B then continues, "What Mr. A said is very true, like the poem clock made by a certain old man in the past, 'Lying with a covered head in the wind and rain at the third watch, touring the lakes and mountains of six dynasties arm in arm', these two lines of embedded characters, embedding the four characters 'three heads and six arms', are so neat and so refreshing! People today cannot make them", similar conversations are also often found among them.</p>
<p>They are tea drinkers and also true tea drinkers. Because they drink a lot of tea, but eat very little dim sum. In the morning, they may only eat three or four steamed dumplings, and in the afternoon, they may only eat two or three small baked cakes. And they mostly keep accounts, each with their own account, and each keeps their own account. Unless it is stated in advance, no one will pretend to be cordial and compete to be the host. These debts are settled during the three major festivals, and even then, they can be temporarily unsettled, leaving some balance to be rolled over to the next festival. Therefore, drinking tea for a year, before the war, cost at most a hundred yuan or so, which was not much, and they could enjoy it without getting tired of it.</p>
<p>As for the people involved, there are noble young masters, tired politicians, uninhibited celebrities, and also those from humble backgrounds who are appreciated for their skills and therefore join them. But most of them are people who are proficient in writing and calligraphy, so they share the same interests and easily become tea drinkers who are in another realm, living without competition and, it can be said, looking down on everything.</p>

<p>New Year's Greetings——Respect to Authors and Readers  Editor</p>
<p>Thank you, readers and authors, for sending us many precious articles from all over the world every day. Many of these crystallizations written from every angle of life have already met everyone on paper, and many have not been published because they are not very suitable.</p>
<p>I believe that the authors who write manuscripts all hope that their works can be published as soon as possible; however, due to various reasons, these manuscripts cannot sometimes be adopted by us.</p>
<p>I would like to make a brief explanation here:</p>
<p>"Freedom Forum" is different from "Essays". It is a comprehensive publication. In addition to general literary and artistic theories, novels, and poems, everything else should be the world of "Freedom Forum." Therefore, the materials for "Freedom Forum" are very broad. "Above and below, ancient and modern", "north and south", everything can be discussed, anecdotes in the literary world and political circles, historical essays, essays; and comments and news in art, music, fine arts, and literary circles, the dynamics of movies, dramas, and old dramas; cartoons, sculptures, woodcuts, songs, and educational and enlightening manuscripts and urban life reflecting reality, all included in the example of "Freedom Forum"'s themes.</p>
<p>In summary, the articles we are willing to publish are those that we hope to be positive, educational, and through various forms of short and concise articles.</p>
<p>These articles may quote ancient and modern times and discuss the world, but they must be interesting, meaningful, lively, and have content and flesh and blood.</p>
<p>The writing themes may open up new paths and find new worlds. Readers will also be bored if they follow behind others.</p>
<p>For example, "fighting tigers" can be temporarily left aside. Too many people have written about it repeatedly these days. Recommending "Eight Thousand Li of Cloud and Moon", we introduced it a long time ago.</p>
<p>This publication hopes to accommodate manuscripts from all aspects, all levels, and all angles. We hope that everyone will write about things they are familiar with and tell everyone your anger, joy, and sorrow.</p>
<p>"Depression" is a symbol of this era. You may wish to quietly refer to more materials and pour out the language that you have accumulated in your heart.</p>
<p>We also welcome readers and authors to tell us what kind of articles you want to see? Are you satisfied with the content of this publication for the past ten days?</p>
<p>Don't be stingy with your paper and postage. We should try to communicate with each other and talk from time to time, so that we can speak freely and achieve "seamless cooperation"!</p>
<p>If possible, I would like to write a letter similar to an explanatory letter to readers and authors every week or ten days.</p>
<p>Best wishes!</p>
<p>Editor, February 27th</p>
<p>(Note: If the manuscript is accompanied by stamps, the unused draft can be returned).</p>
<p>Notice: The manuscript fees for the second half of February in this publication are being settled. Authors of this publication who have not attached their seals and addresses are requested to send them as soon as possible so that the manuscript fee slips can be sent to you as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Freedom Forum</p>
<p>A Literary Man's Contempt——New Words Heard, Talk Four  Ting Song</p>
<p>Literary men have always despised each other. The instructors in various schools are mostly senior scholars.</p>
<p>My late grandfather, Shi Fujun, was selected and appointed as the instructor of Haichang before he was strong. When he first took office, he was often accused of slanderous remarks, but my grandfather dismissed them with a smile. The school palace was close to the Maitreya Nunnery, which was very effective and had a very prosperous incense. A wealthy gentleman gathered public funds to rebuild the temple, and everyone asked Dong, a professor, to write a couplet. Dong was old and sick, and said to everyone: Qian, the instructor, is very rich in literature, why not ask him? My grandfather made a couplet: "Always smiling, laughing at the past and the present, everything is nothing but laughable, generous and tolerant, tolerating heaven and earth, what is there that cannot be tolerated in people." Although the meaning of the words is the same, the atmosphere is very broad. The first line looks at the past and present, and the second line contains a wide range of meaning. The description of Maitreya's expression is especially accurate and unchangeable. It is indeed a famous couplet, and the people of the state unanimously admired it. Therefore, my grandfather served for more than 30 years, and those who were blessed by his teachings achieved great success. Even today, the elders still remember him with praise.</p>
<p>Our Zhejiang has many talented scholars, but literary men despise each other, and it has become a habit. Every time there is a provincial examination, someone must write a couplet to mock the names of the chief and deputy examiners. For example, Li Wentian and Chen Ding said: "The old name of literature, Li Zhongde, why not be slightly despised, the new Ding Ji opened, Chen Boshang can be discussed." The combination of Li Duanyu and Fei Nianci's names is especially clever. The couplet is "Mu Zi Er Mu cannot be said, just teach one character to be unintelligible, for no reason they meet, Fu Bei brother do not be too much, just want thousands of gold to be given, to raise the thought of mercy." One is dedicated to family names, such as Wula Xi Chong, A Yun Chanbin, and then said: "The bird is not as good, just because there is no ink in the chest, the military source can be taken, as there is a bias outside the body." Bai Huanpan Yanxiang said: "Jinshan Temple fights to kick the literary leader, it is difficult to escape the combination bowl, Zishi Street curtain picks the martial sister-in-law, tightly tailored clothes." The next couplet is word-by-word neat, it is indeed the so-called writing is natural, the wonderful hand accidentally obtained it, Mr. Yi Ye, came to Renxuezheng again in Ji Chou, once talked to people about this couplet, saying that the author is indeed scheming, but also because the two people's names are too clever, although the words have regret, but also can be said Junfang's words are wonderful Tian Tianxia, Yu Yin has been known for nearly sixty years, and he misses his teacher. I feel that the world has changed, and I can't help but feel the feelings of the past and the present.</p>
<p>Life at the End of the Century  Tang Shan</p>
<p>In the latter half of the 19th century, a "fin-de-siècle" trend of thought occurred in Europe. The life that expressed this thought was fanaticism, absurdity, humility, shamelessness, and weariness! All kinds of complex expressions and behaviors. People in this era had no bright vision for the future of the entire world; they felt even less pity for their own lives. In this way, as long as life existed, they desperately consumed it, hoping to incorporate all the sounds and colors of the world into their five senses in an instant. Once they had finished enjoying today, it was considered their happiness.</p>
<p>The fin-de-siècle trend of thought in Huanzhou is vaguely similar to the kind of thought of the scholar-official class in the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties in our country. The worldview of the literati in the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties was "Drink today if you have wine, worry about tomorrow if you have no money"! This kind of decadent life is naturally not exclusive to a certain class, it has its social roots and era environment.</p>
<p>We know that European capitalism, developing to the latter half of the 19th century, had already exposed its own contradictions from the peak. A few capitals concentrated and monopolized, so the lives of most people became more and more miserable: they lived lives of semi-starvation, overwork, disappointment and despair. When people reach the point where hope is extinguished and life will never improve, they will naturally negate the meaning of life. Nuerte's "Degenerate Theory", published in 1893, contained many examples of the life attitudes that arose from the negative denial of social life by the life of that time. During the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties, society was turbulent, politics were dark, and people's lives were miserable to the extreme. That heavy and turbulent era made people's hearts seem to have no hope of peace forever. Rather than sitting and waiting for death, it is better to be happy for a moment and die!</p>
<p>A few days ago, a friend came to see me. During the chat, everyone felt that the shadows in front of them were getting thicker and thicker. My friend said: "Now, nothing in culture, science, or art makes people happier or more valued than money." This is really the most cruel shadow of reality. With money dominating everything, the dignity, beauty, harmony, integrity, love, and mutual assistance of life have all been destroyed by money. Now it seems that it is also the end of the century, and people's heavy hearts are only filled with darkness and despair!</p>
<p>Opening the newspaper, there are suicides, robberies, and rapes all day long. On the other hand, there are speculative transactions and extravagant pleasures. How tragic and terrible is this life! Are we going to destroy ourselves before the world is destroyed?</p>
<p>A Civil Servant's Sigh  Jinhua</p>
<p>—A Set of Liu Yong's "Painting Night Joy" Lyrics</p>
<p>I remember when we first met after the restoration, we were only suitable for following the index, but I never expected that a little bit of kindness would turn into a snail's pace. Moreover, the new ten thousand yuan banknotes are exposed, facing the rice weevils of treacherous merchants, I am afraid that the bad times will be difficult to get through from now on;</p>
<p>A bitter hardship, who can I tell, calculating the previous words will eventually be lightly betrayed, if I had known it was so humble, I would have regretted not cultivating the garden in the first place, but after my hometown was burned, there was another × army staying there, a naked body, also had no way to go.</p>
<p>A Record of a City in Danger  Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>In the spring of 1944, I lived idly in Guilin. In addition to occasionally writing short articles for Dagong Daily, I spent my days enjoying the clouds and mists and wandering among the springs and rocks, feeling quite isolated from the times. By the end of May, the sound of artillery fire in northern Hunan resumed, and the enemy's atmosphere became clamorous. After Changsha fell, Hengshan also could not be defended. On the Luxikou line, three cities were lost in one day, and Guilin was greatly shocked. Wealthy families moved west with their entire families, and the order within thousands of miles was greatly disrupted. I also left alone when the local authorities first announced the emergency evacuation order, becoming one of the higher-level refugees. Unexpectedly, at this time, my wife and two children also came from Shanghai to the interior. They had just arrived in Ganzhou when Hengyang fell. I knew nothing about it beforehand, so I left them to wander the roads, leaving everything to fate. By the time we bypassed Guangdong and Guangxi and arrived in Guizhou, more than three months had passed. During this time, they had suffered a lot and had repeatedly been on the verge of danger. When the family reunited, the mother and three children were already thin and shapeless! Therefore, the Hunan-Guangxi campaign left the deepest impression on me. Every time I think of it, I still have lingering fears. This campaign was not only a major tragedy in the late period of the War of Resistance, but also the main reason for the continuous domestic turmoil today. Ashamed that I am not a historian, I cannot follow in the footsteps of Ban Gu and Sima Qian. I will pick up fine remnants and make this novel, but I dare not vainly hope that it can be passed down to future generations!</p>
<p>The outline of this book was completed in the summer of 1945, when I lived in Chengdu. I discussed it with my two brothers, Ying Yunwei and Zhang Huijian, and planned to first complete the novel and then adapt it into a script. We also decided to name it "A Record of a City in Danger." Later, victory came suddenly, and everything changed. For more than ten months, people were confused and had no time to rest, so it was repeatedly delayed, and it was not until now that I could finally hold a pen. Last winter, I saw a short message in a certain magazine, knowing that Mr. Duanmu Hongliang had published a short story in Guangdong, also named "A Record of a City in Danger." I initially planned to rename my work "Flowers in Purgatory" to avoid repetition; however, friends in the industry all criticized its new literary style as too heavy, and considering that one is a novel and the other is a short story, and the authors are not the same person, there should be no confusion even if they have the same name. Therefore, I still use the original name! This is the preface.</p>

<h3>The Issue of Trusteeship of Manus Island: US and Australia Seek Resolution</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 28th] Sources here recently stated that Britain believes the future status of the former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific should be resolved by a peace conference. Britain has notified Washington of this stance, and Australia and New Zealand hold the same position. Regarding the defense policies of the Australian dominion, Britain has now assured its support, especially concerning Manus Island, which the Australian government leased to Britain during the war. The United States has invested $200 million in constructing a base on the island and has requested Australia to transfer the trusteeship of the island to the US. It is now hoped that this issue can be resolved before negotiating the US trusteeship of the former Japanese mandated territories.</p>
<h3>US Generals Emphasize National Defense</h3>
<p>[United Press, Elgin, Illinois, 27th] Former Commander of the Pacific Fleet, Admiral King, today delivered a speech at the Elgin University winter lecture series, advocating for vigorous armament and full vigilance. He stated that the US Navy must be prepared to strike the enemy head-on. Air power or atomic bombs alone are not enough to win. There may be methods of defending against atomic bombs. An atomic bomb is just a type of bomb, an offensive weapon, and by itself, it is absolutely insufficient to win a war. The primary mission of the Navy is to maintain the security of the United States, followed by the security of the Western Hemisphere, and then world peace.</p>
<p>[United Press, Austin, Texas, 7th] Fourth Army Commander Wainwright today delivered a speech at the Texas State Legislature, advocating for the establishment of an atomic bomb air force and the implementation of universal military training to ensure national security. Wainwright stated that the best way to ensure the security of the United States is to build ten or more powerful aircraft and constantly stockpile atomic bombs for use. Such bombers could fly to any location on Earth with a full load of atomic bombs and return. Today's world has only three major powers, one of which is in partial collapse, and another could become an aggressor. The fall of one country will leave us alone to face this threat.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Trains Airborne Troops for Blitzkrieg Attacks - Numbering 100,000, Surpassing Other Countries</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] According to news leaked from the Soviet Union today, the Soviets have or are currently training an airborne army whose strength far exceeds that of airborne armies in other countries. It is reported that the Soviets are training an airborne army specializing in blitzkrieg attacks, numbering as many as 100,000, while the US Army has only 10,000 trained in this area. According to Lend-Lease figures, the United States supplied the Soviet Union with 700 transport aircraft during the war. Experts estimate that only 500 transport aircraft are needed to quickly transport a division of 12,000 troops with all their equipment simultaneously.</p>

<h3>Agreement Reached for Anglo-French Alliance - Signing Possible in Dunkirk Next Tuesday -</h3>
<p>[Our report] London, 28th Broadcast: Bevin stated in the House of Commons that negotiations for the Anglo-French Alliance Treaty have reached an agreement, and it is hoped that it can be signed in Dunkirk next Tuesday.</p>
<p>French Prime Minister's Remarks - Believes Understanding Among Four Powers is Necessary</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] French officials recently revealed that the signing date of the Anglo-French Alliance Treaty may be postponed. Rumors from foreign sources that France will standardize its military equipment according to the standards of the United States and Britain are entirely baseless.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] French Prime Minister Ramadier held his weekly press conference today, expressing hope that Britain and France could conclude an alliance treaty as soon as possible and predicting that the harmony and unity of the Anglo-French-Soviet triangular relationship would create a favorable atmosphere before the opening of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. Prime Minister Ramadier said that France had submitted a memorandum on the German issue to the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. The governments of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union had raised reservations on some points and expressed disagreement on others, but the overall response was still good. We may be able to reach a compromise through four-way compromise, and we will do our best to create an atmosphere of understanding between countries. Although British-Soviet negotiations for concluding a treaty have encountered difficulties, they are currently progressing smoothly. British-French negotiations began after the Soviet Union requested revisions to the Anglo-Soviet treaty. The Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference has yet to resolve the various difficult issues concerning Germany, and it is important to give new impetus to realistic peace policies and reduce suspicion among countries.</p>
<h3>US Congressman Suggests Merging Iceland - Denmark Protests to the US - Saying Such Suggestions Are Inappropriate</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Reykjavik, Iceland, 27th] Icelandic Foreign Minister Benediktsson told Parliament that he had instructed Icelandic Minister to the United States Thors to protest to the US State Department against the suggestion of California Republican Congressman Gearhart to invite Iceland to join the United States as the 49th state. Iceland believes that making such suggestions in the US Congress is inappropriate. Gearhart had also requested the United States to negotiate the purchase of island bases in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Caribbean Seas.</p>
<p>According to United Press, Washington: Local newspapers unanimously believe that although US Congressman Gearhart has made these two suggestions to Congress, Congress will not seriously consider them.</p>
<h3>Inviting the Soviet Union and Other Countries to Jointly Investigate the Arctic</h3>
<p>Canadian Foreign Minister Delivers Speech in New York</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 27th] Canadian Foreign Minister Laurent today delivered a speech at the New York Pilgrims Society, inviting the Soviet Union and other United Nations countries to join the United States and Canada in jointly investigating the Arctic. Laurent said: "I don't know why we shouldn't seek various conveniences within the framework of the United Nations to explore knowledge about the northern region on the broadest possible basis. I dare say that our country is happy to cooperate in this endeavor, but on the condition of reciprocity. We have already exchanged meteorological information with our Soviet neighbors on the basis of reciprocity, so why not extend this to other useful information? The Soviet newspapers' reports about the activities of the United States and Canada in the Far North are based on fabrication and misunderstanding. Canada has not provided military bases to the United States. Anyone can freely enter northern Canada. They can see the small scientific measuring station at Fort Churchill in Manitoba, with fewer than one hundred American soldiers stationed there."</p>
