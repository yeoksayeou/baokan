<h3>國務會將決定要案澄清時局加速戡亂　動員全國實施戰時禮制</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕中樞決定加強剿共軍事，澄淸時局，四日上午九時由蔣主席親自主持之第六次國務會議中，將有重要議案提出，用以昭示全國，集中力量，克底於成。此項提案連日經各方會商研討，業已擬定。三日下午六時，蔣主席在官邸召見五院院長。吳鐵城，陳布雷，陳立夫，邵力子，白崇禧，陳誠等十一人，對提案內容作最後討論，至七時半始散。聞提案中規定全國總動員，集中力量，實施戰時體制，以期早日結束戡亂軍會，一俟國務會議通過，即正式宣佈，其實施辦法則交由主管各部草擬，如軍糧徴借，由糧部負責，徴兵由國防部負責等，此項提案實即類似一總動員令。孫科三日晚宴民靑兩黨負責人士時，曾將提案原文由吳鼎昌取出傳觀，彼等對此並無異議。據政府某負責人士稱，國府對戡亂之態度，已見於二日嘉獎四平戰役守軍之明令中，目前似已無發表文吿之必要。</p>
<p>三黨提名選舉辦法決成立小組會討論</p>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕國民黨中央黨部三日晚八時有盛大集會，孫科邀宴民靑兩黨重要人士，商談有關選舉問題。計有民靑兩黨胡海門，戢翼翹，蔣匀田，左舜生，陳啓天，王世憲等及政府方面吳鐵城，陳立夫，張厲生，部力子等廿一人，席間由民靑兩黨人士提出三黨聯合提出候選人之辦法，有人表示反對，經硏討後，決定三黨各推三人，成立九人小組會，討論提名辦法及手續諸問題。至十時散</p>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕靑年黨府委余家菊，三日對記者談稱，澄淸地方政治之必備條件，應爲軍政分治與軍民合作兩點，前者即在戰區對於軍政權限亦應予劃分，行政官之威望應行提高，勿使車八過問行政，則政治自明，循序漸進。後者又爲軍人應加强訓練，須確愛護老百姓，以便做到軍民合作。余稱共黨有兩種特性，一爲在種種方面設法削弱國力，一爲絕對排他性，故極難與之合作。記者詢以國務會議，四日將有表示對共態度之提案提出，靑年黨有何意見？余氏認爲其中應包括下列數點：（一）被迫作戰之態度，申述與共黨無法以和平方式取得合作，並非政府不願爲政治方式求得解決，而係無法用政治方式獲得解決。（二）在非戰區內，應充分注意澄淸地方政治，加强經濟建設，使人民生活得以安定。（三）一般人民均恐怖於戰時狀態，故應說明避免增加人民之痛苦與負担，征兵征糧等，應盡量避兔。余氏對於政府正式表示態度，昭吿人民以振軍心，認爲必要之舉，惟不必下令討伐。</p>
<h3>忠勇苦鬥確保名城主席電勉全體將士　陳明仁蓄鬚紀念四平戰役</h3>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽三日電〕此次四平之戰，賴我將士忠勇堅決苦鬥，卒能擊退頑敵，確保名城，爲革命史上添光榮之一頁，蔣主席頃特電勉全體將士云：熊主任，杜長官轉四平街陳軍長，劉主席，並轉向，陳兩副軍長，馬參謀長，政治部吳主任，熊，彭，趙，宋各師長，各副師長，參謀長，各師政治部主任，各團，營，連，排長曁各作戰官兵均鑒，各同志九死一生，爲黨國，爲主義，忠勇壯烈激戰十八晝夜，發揚黄埔革命精神，不惜犧牲到底，保衛疆土，誓共存亡，碧血丹心，足以泣鬼神而動天地，乃邀上帝保祐，卒能使我四平轉危爲安，我總理，先烈，陣亡將士之靈，亦有慰藉矣。頃聞解圍捷報，不勝悲歡交集，未知我死傷官兵實數幾何，希速査報，以便撫卹，幷將各部隊有功官兵切實査復，傳得速頒獎賞，表彰殊勳，並望詳報地方人民損失與死傷情形爲要。</p>
<p>〔聯合社四平街三日電〕陳明仁軍長，湖南人，現年四十八，壯健溫文，美鬚髯，三日向記者鄭重談稱：「過去廿日間，本人無睱薙沐，故蓄此物，茲將永久留作四平街一役之紀念」。七十　一軍乃根據戰時租借法案最先接獲美國配備之國軍，所屬八十七師九營中僅餘四營，現由五十四師防守市區東南，八十七師防守西北，八十八師防守東北，此外，尙有保安隊一千人。</p>
<h3>趙家驤預言　東北戰局</h3>
<p>將變爲國際衝突</p>
<p>〔合衆社瀋陽三日電〕東北保安長官部參謀總長趙家　，三日吿合衆記者稱：東北之鬥爭，乃蘇聯以中國內戰爲掩飾，企圖攫得該區，渠預料，在一年內，此將變爲一國際衝突。渠攻擊蘇軍官在四平街一戰中指揮共軍作戰。渠稱：被蘇聯遷移之龐大瀋陽兵工廠，並未遷於蘇聯，而重建於鄰近中蘇邊境之東北境內，爲中共製造軍火，其他在大連爲蘇聯取去之機器，則交與中共，製造地雷及手溜彈。趙氏將目前東北之爭奪與以前日本强佔該地相比，渠稱：「新日本人」更比舊日本人聰明，因舊日本人並未能達掩飾其帝國主義野心之目的，「然而熊掌在東北爲一珍餚，如不撤退，吾人將把牠吃掉」。</p>
<p>趙氏稱：國軍將不惜犧牲保衛東北，並指出，在中日戰爭三年之後，其他國家，亦開始捲入戰爭漩渦，「此次亦將發生同一情形」。</p>
<p>渠攻擊前日本關東軍總參謀長齊藤中將，現爲共軍東北司令林彪之軍事顧問，渠稱：此項情報，以及蘇聯軍官在四平街援助共軍作戰之情報，乃國軍守四平街將領陳明仁將軍自被俘共軍所獲悉者。趙氏又稱：四平街一戰，乃目前戰役之「轉捩點」，並宣稱：共黨此戰死亡二萬五千人，傷二萬五千人，而國軍之損失，祇有四千人死亡，一萬一千人受傷。渠承認國軍在東北遭遇嚴重之壓迫，但決堅守其現在之陣地，趙氏宣稱：「現國軍攻勢守勢皆獲勝利」，當記者表示，渠或許太强調東北衝突中之蘇聯之部分，因共軍大部皆爲多年來與國民黨進行鬥爭之中國人，趙氏答稱：「過去亦有不少中國人站在日人方面作戰」。</p>
<h3>國軍改變戰略捕捉共軍主力</h3>
<p>〔本報長春三日電〕據此間軍事觀察家談：國軍決改變戰略，今後採取積極主動，將視進展情形，超越收復區，捕捉共軍主力，以期予以殲滅，謀求長期安定。共軍在此次四平會戰中，雖已蒙受重大打擊，惟其殘部仍潛伏流竄吉長外圍及平梅，吉海沿綫化整爲零與國軍周旋，故東北戰事已由大兵團戰鬥轉變爲兜捕共軍分散之兵力。共軍此次潰敗，與以往所不同者，爲彼等並未抱頭鼠竄江北，吾人對戰局前途極抱樂觀，但不可因樂觀而輕敵，共軍在此次大戰中，彈藥補給源源不絕，尤使吾人知所警惕也。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓二日電〕馬歇爾國務卿二日召開記者會，記者以最近軍火售予中國一事相詢，馬卿答稱：運華物費限制之解除，並非美國擬支持中國政府從事內戰之謂。馬卿謂：此項軍火售華，僅係本身上一種單獨行動。而不足以象徴一種政策。此種型式軍火之一部份不適於美國配備之用，僅適用於中國自造之中正步槍。其轍出許可證業已簽發，中國政府可按照通常手續購買此項軍火。運輸機及飛機零件之出口許可證亦已簽發，輸送該批軍火乃此項行動之一部份。馬卿後謂。此項軍火並不供應與中國美式配備部隊。記者詢以中國之形勢是否使美國政策有修改之必要，馬卿對此拒作評論。對於某記者之談話馬卿亦拒絕討論。</p>
<h3>四平街公主嶺刦後損失重大　劉翰東呼籲救濟孑遺</h3>
<p>〔本報北平三日電〕東北外運大豆，因受戰火，損失在數十億以上。中長路瀋陽至長春之間，爲大豆豐產區，勝利後，中信局，各金融機關，商號，以至糧商，紛紛出關，在中長路各站採購此項大豆，運銷國外，以獲取外匯，或連關內出售獲利。東北戰雲未緊以前，公主嶺·四平街·昌圖。開原外運之大豆，堆積如山，迨戰火波及後，一部被焚，一部散失，估計損失數達十億元以上，聞平市某商業機關，將勝利後所獲利潤悉數撥赴東北，購買大豆，經此次戰火，損失重大。</p>

<h3>進出口連鎖辦法　全國經委會昨續予審查過份龐大機構決定緊縮</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕全國經委會三日午後繼續舉行全體審査會，硏討經濟改革方案，經四小時之討論，對方案中有關農，工，商，財政，糧食，交通各項，咸有縝密硏究或修正並決定由蕭錚爲「金融與引導游資」部份審査整理召集人，徐柏園爲財政部份審査整理召集人，今日會議由徐堪主席，出席翁文灝，張嘉璈，兪鴻鈞，陳啓天等二十餘人，首由兪鴻鈞，張嘉璈，譚伯羽分別作業務報吿，繼即開始討論。其中最重要者，爲進出口許可連鎖辦法，委員中對此辦法頗多不能同意者，認爲目前遽加實行，易滋流弊，例如進口貨有受美國出口限制者，美國可以出口者，往往爲我所限制入口者。彼此對進出口旣非完全採自由主義，實行連鎖，當然困難。再者，結匯亦爲困難之點，蓋如不完全採取職貨辦法，則非結匯不可，若照官價，必非商人所願，如按黑市，政府當碍難接受，決議由中央銀行與經部會擬辦法，再行決定。</p>
<p>討論工業政策時，翁文灝對原方案所提「工業建設應盡量分設在燃料原料便宜之地」，不能同意，認此種辦法不能適應將來建設之需，應予修正。簡貫三提議，根據國防與民生需要及資源分佈，將全國分成若干大工業區，此一意見應列入方案之中。其他委員提出修正與辯論，意見甚多，乃決議由翁文灝召集，陳啓天，潘序倫，鄧飛黄等參照第一期經濟原則及各委員所發表之意見，審査修正。關於集合公私立銀行，組織復興金融公司，以長期投資於工鑛建設事業，並利用華僑資金及存放國外之外匯資金投資於該公司，以向國外購入機器及原料一款，正反面爭辯甚烈，結果以投資工鑛建設事業爲宗旨者，可以設立。　會中又討論，鐵通何者爲幹綫，何者為支綫，其幹綫由中央全力經營，支綫在中央管理制度下許可，並鼓勵地方及民間經營。</p>
<p>譚伯羽說明後，會中照交部意見通過，關於簡化稽征，劉振東等認爲商人往往以此爲藉口，有所要挾，以達到延繳少繳目的，決議將簡化稽征一項删去。</p>
<p>該委會一般預算小組及財政小組三日晨聯席會議通過要案如下：（一）爲節省國家文出，過份龐大之機構，予以緊縮及裁員。（二）國營·公營事業機稱及銀行職工待遇，應與一班公敎軍職人員劃一，以昭公允，並研討提高公敎軍職人員待遇，以求劃一。</p>

<h3>憲政史上重要一頁　記者立委名額增加　立院決議由二名增為五名</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕立法院三日晨舉行三三一次例會，孫兼院長主席。出席立委八十餘人，通過要案有：（一）修正國產菸酒類稅條例。（二）修正遠警罰法第五十一條第三項條文案。（三）懲治走私條例案。（四）修正戰爭罪犯審判條例第二十五條，及第卅二條條文案。（五）修正中國農民銀行土地債權法第四條條文案（土地債券之面額，分五萬元，二萬元，一萬元三種）。（六）刑法委員會報吿核復在華美軍人員刑事案件條例通用期間，可否延長至美軍全數撤離時爲止案，決議照審査憲見通通，（修正處理在華美軍人員刑事案件條例第七條。本條例自公布日施行，其有效期間至美軍全數撤離時爲止）。（七）修正禁烟禁毒治罪條例第十七條，第十八條，及修正特種刑事案件訴訟條例第三條條文案。（八）職業團體選出之立法委員名額分配表案。（九）委員趙珮等報請增加立法委員西藏名額兩名，分配於靑海藏族案。（十）國民大會婦女代表名額分配表，決議重付審査，並決定原則，國大婦女團體代表名額一六八名中，各省市基本數，每單位應佔二名，全國性婦女團體代表廿名，餘按人口多寡平均分配省市。此外通過預算案五起。會議自上午九時半開始，至十二時半散會，並定四日下午四時續開會。</p>
<p>〔本報南京三電〕事關記者參政之立委職業代表記者名額問題，三日晨於立法院例會中提出時，賴陳訓　據理力爭，陳海澄。鍾天心仗義執言，及孫兼院長之支持，決議：根據陳訓鑫所提臨時動議，將自由職業代表名額自原定十名增至十五名，記者代表名額亦自原分配之兩名增至五名。此事對新聞界人士今後以其超然地位，宣楊民主，倡導憲政，關係殊鉅，不特在新聞史上立一新紀程碑，即在憲政史上，亦爲重要一頁。</p>
<h3>行憲開始之際記者責任重大</h3>
<p>本案係根據「立法委員職業代表名額分配表」而提出。憲法法規委員會委員長劉克　報吿審査經過後，司徒德·劉友琛相繼發言，對立法委員職業代表分配表中工商業團體名額分配，各有寳貴意見指出。繼由陳訓念發言，陳氏今日曾提一有立委二十二人連署之臨時動議，建議增加自由職業代表名額，並將記者代表比率提高至百分之六·由二名增加至五名。</p>
<p>陳氏說明此提案時稱：根據審查會分配八十四名職業代表中，自由職業代表十名，祗佔總額百分之十一點九，似嫌太少，而此十名中，又須由新聞記者。律師。會計師。技師·醫藥團體五個單位再爲分配，將來譯細分配，由肚會部定之，然該部數字，係根據四月份以前統計新聞團體會員僅三千人，而事實上，浙江·京·滬等地皆未列入，依吾人估計，全國新聞記者會員總數當在三萬人以上，三千人之數並不確實，依此分配立委比率殊欠準確陳氏又指出，根據以前規定，敎育團體原屬自由職業類，現將其特別提出，此稱尊重敎育之舉措，用意甚佳，然經此種改動後，敎育團體名額，自原有之總數百分之六陡增至百分之廿，增加幾達三倍，似應重加考慮。陳氏並以激動之語調稱：新聞記者於抗戰時期，追隨政府，轉徙後方，於槍林彈雨中，從事報道，旣已有甚大貢獻，當此行憲開始之際更需要深知民間疾苦之新聞記者盡其宣　民主，倡導憲政之責任。目前自由職業僅得立委十名，記者所佔名額最多不過兩名，衡以全國記者人數及其職責，似嫌過少。本席茲臨時動議，將記者團體名額增至百分之六，而在自由職業團體項內明白規定，至自由職業團體總數，則請自百分之十一點九提高至百分之十八。</p>
<h3>院長及各立委發言支持記者</h3>
<p>陳氏言畢，陳茹玄等紛起發言，對其建議，僉表贊同。陳茹玄認自由職業關係重要，代表名額應予增加。並指出完全以人數多寡爲分配標準，殊失公允，然以單位作爲標準，亦不公平，最妥善之辦法，莫若視該團體對國家社會目前之貢獻及將來之需要，再定名額多寡。我國以農立國，以工建國，農工團體所佔名額應多，自由職業僅有代表十名，而須由律師·會計師。技師·新聞記者。醫藥團體等五個單位分配，似應酌予增加。</p>
<p>陳海澄亦採同樣看法，指出各業代表】因囿於本業利益，往往僅爲本身謀發展，新聞記者固亦有其顧慮之點，然彼等所顧慮者，僅爲言論自由如何不受限制，其他方面即無任何利害關係，而其當選者又必爲饒有經騐之輩，以其客觀冷靜公平之頭腦，自能顧到各個角落。記者熟悉各階層利益，在他日立法院中可起調和作用，現僅規定記者選出代表兩名，實有加以考慮必要。陳氏生張記者所增加之名額，應自敎育團體之百分之廿中劃出，蓋立法院一年開會八個月，且有種種審査會，敎育代表若顧及本職，則勢將燕法參加會議，兩者兼顧，又所難能，敎育代表固應增加，然增加數不應如此衆多，而應將其所佔總比例讓出一部。</p>
<p>孫兼院長起立發言，亦認自由職業團體組織最爲健全，而名額最少，値得考慮。並指出全國職業團體中，組織以農會爲最差，而分得最多，於八十四名中，佔廿四名，將來勢將爲非眞正農民所操縱，應予減少。</p>
<p>「記者之友」鍾天心發言，認增加敎育團體名額，其本意僅在表示尊重敎育，然所謂敎育，不能僅限於學校，若將其範圍擴大，報紙亦應尊重，蓋今日之報紙，其對社會所起影響，決不在學校之下，因之若爲尊重敎育而增加名額，不應僅增敎育團體名額，而應同時增加自由職業及新聞記者名額，敎育團體至多僅能有十二名，所餘五名，應撥歸自由職業，記者名額應增三名，自原有之兩名增爲五名。</p>
<h3>我將重申禁令不准外機侵入</h3>
<p>禁航條例正草擾中</p>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕政府爲保護領空主權，對外國飛搬之隨意侵入我國領空，將重申禁令，禁航條例正由團防部次長費鎭球主持，會同內政部，外交部，及有關單位，商定原則，短期可草擬完成。</p>
<h3>職業團體立委名額分配決定</h3>
<p>討論至此，已歷一小時許，傳統先，司徒德等建議先決定若干原則，陳顧遠並假定一分配比例，即農業團體十八，工業十八，漁業三，工商幽體十六，敎育十三，自由職業十六。</p>
<p>至此，孫兼院長再度起立發言，指出根據我國傳統觀念，士農工商向來並重，吾人今日討論立委職業代表名額分配，不應以人口或區域爲依據，而應視其對國家社會之重要性。現可作一基本分配，將各種職業分成農業，工業，商業，敎育，自由職業五大組，每組各得十五名，共七十五名，再加漁業三名，共七十八名，僅餘六名未分配，可分入農工團體。陳顧遠主張工農各增三名。</p>
<p>會塲即以此一意見表決，以多數通過，農業十八，工業十八，漁業三名，商業五，工礦十，敎育十五，自由職業十五。繼討論在此八十四名中婦女應佔數目。根據原案，僅有女代表八人，傅岩力爭後，決增爲十人，惟如何分配，會中看法不同，傳岩認會計師，律師，記者應有女代表，然其他委員咸認應增加入敎育等團體。最後決該，農業團體有女代表二人，工業團體三人，敎育三人，自由職業二人（一爲律師一爲醫師），總數爲十名。</p>
<p>最後討論自由職業名額分配表，僉認陳訓念原提案所列殊公允，無異議，照其提議通過，即新聞記者五名，醫藥團體四名（女一），律師三名（女一），技師二名，會計師一名，共十五名。</p>
<p>今日討論此案時，發言委員卅餘人，幾無一不爲新聞記者此一要求支持者。散會後，各委員並紛向旁聽記者致賀。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕據悉：新聞界已決定在職業團體中競選者，有新聞報社長程滄波，中央社總編輯陳博生，申報總編輯陳訓悉，和平日報社長黄少谷，東南日報社長胡健中等五人。</p>
<h3>西藏立委增加五名</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕立法院三日討論委員趙珮等提請增加立委西藏名額兩名，分配於靑海藏族一案，決議照審査意見通過，西藏立法委員名額增加兩名，將西藏立法委員名額分配表及立法委員選舉罷兔法第四條第三款一併修正，茲錄於後：（甲）修正立法院立法委員選舉罷兔法第四條條文，立法委員之名額如下：（一）全國各省直輸市　出者，其人口在三百萬以下者五名，其人口超過三百萬者，每滿一百萬人增選一人。（二）蒙古各盟旗選出者，共二十二名。（三）西藏選出者共十五名。（四）各民族在邊疆地區選出者共六名。（五）僑居國外國民選出者共十九名。（六）職業團體選出者共八十四名。前項各款名額之分配，另以法律定之。（乙）西藏立法委員名額分配表：（一）西廠地方五名，內婦女一名。（二）暫時旅居內地西藏人民五名。（三）省區藏民五名，在青海選出者二名在西康選出者二名，在甘肅選出者一名。</p>
<h3>討論國大婦女代表名額分配　男女立委發生有趣爭辯</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕立法院三日午討論國大婦女代表名額分配表時，男女立委發生有趣爭辯，孫兼院長夫人及包德明·唐國槓等女代表雖列席助威，然會塲始終在一面倒空氣下，各立委對所謂「全國性婦女團體」盡情攻擊，而最令婦女界失望者，爲根據審査會規定，全國性婦女團體可選代表三十三人，婦女界認爲太少，要求增爲四十名，詎結果反減爲二十名，此案提付表決時，全塲八十餘立委除五位女性外，男立委全體舉手，隨之即聞一片哈哈聲，包德明於旁聽席上高呌：「今天都是你們男人世界」，悻悻之狀，溢於言表，然終無法挽回頽勢。會中決定，婦女團體代表名額以相差基本數兩名爲原則，並按人口多寡，再行增加，詳細分配由憲法法規委會硏討，再向大會提出。</p>

<h3>紀念美國獨立</h3>
<p>一百七十一年前的今天，美洲殖民地聯合了十三州，英勇反抗英國的高壓政策，在軍事上雖然正在最黑暗的時期；但是大陸會議却在那一天發表了一個「獨立宣言」，宣佈各國的政治應以人類的天賦權利爲基礎，以自由平等爲最高指導原則。從此以後，七月四日，不僅是美國的國慶日，値得美國人民的熱烈慶祝；而且也是現代史上最偉大的一個日子，一百七十餘年來，各民族的要求獨立解放與世界各國人民的要求政治民主化，如火如茶，都可以說是受了這個獨立宣言的啓示與感召：所以每年到了七月四日，我們不僅慶祝美國國慶，而且也替人類的自由平等的前途，馨香祈禱。我們緬懷過去，深知創業開國之不易，正視目前請國際環境，益感人類的前途荆棘叢生。茲乘美國獨立紀念日，一述我們對於美國平素所抱的期望。</p>
<p>第一，美國是一個首先覺醒而崛起的新興國家，在現代政治思想史上，首先揭示人類的天賦權利，高唱出自由平等的口號，其後各國的革命運動，風起雲湧，對外要求民族的解放與獨立，對內要求人民的自由與平等，都可以說是受了美國革命影饗的結果。所以一百七十餘年以來，美國革命，在美國本身說，是完全成功了，美國不僅已從英國的統治下獲得了解放；而且其獨立宣言所揭示的幾個原則，沒有一項沒有實現；今日之美國，已在領導世界各國，共同致力於世界和平的締造；但是從遠處看，一百七十餘年以來，美國所憧憬的理想，還沒有完全實現，試看今日的世界，還有多少民族仍受別國的統治，根本談不到自由平等；再看世界各國的政情，同樣也有許多國家的人民，仍受少數人的操縱，根本談不上民主政治。美國在國際上旣處於領導地位，對於世界的和平與人民的基本權利，不能不負有一稱特殊的責任，美國自當應加倍努力，推已及人，使各民族均能獲得解放，不受任何一國的控制；使各國的人民均能享受自由平等的權利，不再受任何集權政體的威脅；這樣才能使世人眞正能相信，美國兩次參加世界大戰，的確是「爲民主而戰」。美國政府當局爲履行其責任起見，對於整個世界，尤應高瞻遠矚，推行一個外交政策，旣不應分歐美，更不應分歐亞。我們覺得目下世界的危機，乃在思想上的衝突；美國雖爲新興的國家，僅有一百七十餘年的歷史，但是美國人民的思想，仍不外乎獨立革命時的兩大　義—民族主義與民主主義。而且其憧憬的理想，尙未能完全實現，所以蘇聯外長草洛托夫批評美國式的民主政治，是十八世紀的民主政治。這雖是莫洛托夫的諷刺，但是不能不認爲當前美國的隱憂；美國當局不可不特別提高警覺，正視現實，如何保持美國永遠是一個新興的國家，永遠站在時代的前面。</p>
<p>第二，美國是竭誠盼望這個戰後的世界能眞正步入和平民主的新時代的，這是誰也不能否認的；但是美國政府當局深知戰後的危機，若干民族刻正横遭他國的干涉與壓迫；若干國家的人民根本無自由可言，世界政治不能民主化，在國際間卽無和平可言。杜魯門總統爲了要援助他國抵抗外來的威脅，同時又爲了要扶助他國人民建設成爲民主的統一的强大的國家，乃有援助希土兩國法案的提出，成爲今日人人皆知的杜魯門主義。以目前的國際形勢來權衡杜魯門主義。不論你是民主黨也好，或是共和黨也好，是無法加以非議的，但是從美國的實際外交政策看來，所謂杜魯門主義實施的範圍，僅以歐洲一隅爲限。馬歇爾國務卿所提出的「援歐計劃」，大家都認此爲杜魯門主義的第二章的，就是一個好的蹬明，美國這樣的慷慨爲懷，論理必能獲得歐洲各國的一致歡迎，決不會被人歪曲事實。指斥美國援助他國懷有帝國主義的野心。我們站在第三者的立塲，平心而論，國際間誤會的引起，實由於美國政策的不澈底所致。所以我們不能不奉吿美國政府，任何一種政策，任何一種主義，均有其整個性及聯貫性，否則卽不成爲政策，也不成爲主義，止謗莫善於修身。美國應該反躬自省，援助歐洲復興固屬必要，援助亞洲也有同樣的需要，何以美國僅欲援助歐洲，當不免要使蘇聯懷疑美國的用意。現在英法蘇三國外長會議，已經不歡而散了，馬歇爾國務卿的援歐計劃，自有重加考慮的必要的了。</p>
<p>要之，今日的世界，需要美國的援助，不僅十公迫切，而且爲數頗鉅；反之，戰後的美國，爲世界的和平計，同時也爲自身的前途計，也有援助世界各國復興的必要，因爲美國繁榮，並不完全靠她國內的消費，而建立在世界市塲上。所以盼望美國援助的各戰災國家，固然要知自方更生之道，然後始獲得人助；卽所謂天助自助者。就是在援助他國的美國也要明瞭，助人就是助己。爲了遠大的理想，而援助他國達到其目的，是不能附有任何條件的，美國對於中國目前的情形，尤有特別加以考慮的必要。</p>
<p>最後，七月四日，也是菲律濱共和國宣佈獨立的國慶日，我們願以同樣的心情，慶祝菲國的國慶，並盼望中菲兩國通力合作，共同維持太平洋上的永久和平！</p>

<h3>英法決召開歐洲大會　商馬卿援歐計劃　蘇聯亦在被邀參加之列　日期已定本月十二日地點仍為巴黎</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎三日廣播：英法兩國將召開歐洲二十四國全體大會，日期已定七月十二日，地點爲巴黎，將討論馬歇爾復興歐洲計劃。請柬業已發出，致送歐洲各國，惟西班牙則不在其內。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎三日廣播：歐洲二十四國大會，已定十二日召開，其目的在迅速擬就計劃，在九月一日前送交美國。</p>
<p>又訊：法方今以請柬送交蘇公使鮑格莫洛夫，並附函一件，希望蘇聯改變態度，勿再堅持，而參加歐洲復興工作。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦三日廣播：英法兩國發表聯合公報稱：英法政府決邀請歐洲各國（西班牙除外）參加歐洲復興計劃之起草，就各國資源及需要加以檢討，使各國得有自由決定之權。公報對於蘇聯及英法蘇三國會議之失敗，均無隻字提及。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎三日電〕英外長貝文與法外長皮杜爾今日再度會談，恐係繼續討論美國務卿馬歇爾援歐復興計劃，同時蘇聯外長莫洛托夫則已啓程返國。此事使英法與蘇聯間對於馬歇爾計劃之意見不合，益形戲劇化。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三日電〕美國官方今日認爲蘇聯之拒絕參加歐洲復興工作，亦意料中事，然高級外交界方面對之殊覺愁悶，美官方希望英法在單獨進行時，仍勿關閉使蘇聯參加之機會。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎三日電〕此間預料貝文於星期四日下午返倫敦，並信皮杜爾將於星期五或星期六日飛往倫敦。數日之後，即將發出一英法聯署之請帖，邀請蘇聯以外之所有歐洲國家參加。據此間外交家之意見，蘇聯拒絕合作之眞正理由，乃深恐馬歇爾計劃之成功，將减弱其對東歐大部分國家之控制力量。據悉：何國可能參加一項問題，尙未討論及之。衆信可能參加之國家，將包括盧森堡，義大利，希臘，瑞士，德國之西方佔領區，丹麥挪威或許亦在內。瑞典由於其地理上接近蘇聯，尙難確定。又信若干國家，如捷克等，由於莫洛托夫之決定，使其地位進退維谷，因捷克人之願參加馬歇爾計劃，乃衆所週知之事實也。蘇聯援助此等窮乏之國家，自不能與美國相匹敵，但東歐各國是否敢犯蘇聯之忌，接受英法邀請，尙屬疑問。據觀察家稱：此次會議最顯著之一項結果，乃法國自一九四四年以來，首次明確表示與西方共其命運，甚至對蘇聯之目的，表示仇視。此種突向右轉之行動，在共產黨爲國內之獨一無二之最右勢力政黨之法國，易引起嚴重之內部磨擦云。</p>
<h3>英法蘇外長會議失敗後　歐洲將分裂為二　英官方認為前途殊悲觀</h3>
<p>〔合衆肚巴黎二日電〕蘇聯二日拒絕參與馬歇爾之歐洲經濟復興計劃後，歐洲即自波羅的海起，沿德國北部之斯德丁以至義大利東疆之特里埃斯特，分裂爲二。據預料所及，在十一月間四强外長會議在倫敦開幕論之四個月夜長夢多之時期中，西方國家將從事於馬歇爾計劃之工作，而蘇聯則在「鐵幕」後再設法增强其地位。</p>
<p>〔聯合肚華盛頓二日電〕國務院今夜聞已完全進備不顧蘇聯拒絕與英法合作，仍照馬歇爾計劃進行，援助歐洲復興。倫敦方面高級官方坦白承認，英內閣對於馬歇爾計劃之前途極爲悲觀，英法雖擬不顧蘇聯，照當進行，但任何計劃，如無蘇聯及其與國贊助，極易流產。因此之故，英國已作準備，萬一馬歇爾計劃失敗，英國將大事減少輸入。</p>
<h3>巴黎會議失敗賴依表示惋惜</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖二日電〕關於巴黎三國會議破裂一項消息，聯合國秘書長賴依聞之。引爲惋惜，並吿招待記者會稱：聯合國當繼續致力於此，以履行馬歇爾之歐洲復興計劃。</p>
<h3>英美將准許德國提高鋼鐵生產量　對巴黎會議失敗馬卿拒不置評</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二日電〕美國早日料及蘇聯將拒絕英法二國進行馬歇爾之援助歐計劃，馬歇爾國務卿今日在招待記者會上雖拒不加以評論，但已透露美國與英國將不顧蘇聯之拒絕合作，將策動復興計劃之情報，略謂：德境英美佔領區即將公佈修正其工業生產標準，將准許鋼之生產每年增至一千萬噸，即將四强所同意之噸額，提高兩倍。馬卿雖未說明英美已料及蘇聯將拒絕參加此項援歐計劃，但就即將宣佈工業生產一事而論，當可證明兩國對於促進德國復興，實已有所準備。有詢以巴黎會議失敗後之觀感，馬卿拒不加以批評。</p>
<h3>右派拍桌叫囂　法議會怪劇　黑林黨案情重大</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎二日電〕法國大會今晚舉行會議，賴瑪迪總理在提及最近揭發之「藍計劃」叛變陰謀時，右派自由共和黨領袖蘭尼埃爾比，認總理誹謗國民大會右派份子，遂與之發生激烈舌戰，會塲秩序一時大亂，擊桌叫囂之聲不絕於耳，大會乃不歡而散。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎二日電〕法國「黑林黨」叛國陰謀破獲以來，現正在進行調査，惟嚴守一切秘密，案情似較最初所想像者更爲嚴重。聞內長在今晨向閣議報吿此一案件時，曾謂，「此事實非僅爲破獲一軍火秘密庫而已。」至各犯姓名，內長在未獲充份證據之前則拒不宣布。惟其中一名重要嫌疑犯即外部秘書長之子夏希弗爾，其活動情形則已獲悉。此外，法殖民地軍隊總監拉里米那被革職一事，乃今日內閣決議案中最驚人之一件。</p>
<h3>印尼新內閣成立　新總理由夏利福亭出任　進步派回敎徒薩林任外交部長</h3>
<p>〔聯合社日惹三日電〕印尼社會黨，工黨，及國民黨經磋商一星期後，今日卒同意由社會黨員前國防部長夏利福亭組織聯合內閣，總統索卡諾遂宣布任夏氏為新總理，以繼沙利之缺。夏氏現年四十歲，自印尼共和國成立以來，歷任內閣閣員，與前總理沙利雖屬同黨，但非同屬溫和派。一般人士認為夏氏係最能控制印尼軍隊之政治家，最近內閣發生危機，沙利被迫辭職，其故即在夏氏個人拒絕加以支持。日軍侵爪哇，夏氏被判處死刑，旋經索卡諾設法減輕罪名，改判無期徒刑。逮及日本投降，方得恢復自由。後曾一度因從事國民運動，爲荷蘭當局監禁一年之久。</p>
<p>〔聯合社日惹三日電〕據悉，印尼國民黨員加尼與工黨黨員西提亞傑，業被任命為副總理，恊助新總理夏利福亭組閣。夏氏與加尼仍各兼任國防部長與經濟部長。進步派回敎徒薩林則任外交部長。薩林現正從事運動阿刺伯同盟各國承認印尼共和國。</p>

<h3>英自治領事務部　更改名稱　英王尊號亦將隨之變更</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二日電〕艾德禮首相今日在下院宣布：自治領事務部大臣及自治領事務部，將易名爲共和邦關係部大臣及共和邦關係部，良以英國國內外若干人士皆認自治領之名稱，足以引起聯合王國與共和邦內其他國家間關係之悮解故也。本社政治記者威登並稱，自治領之名稱廢止後，英王喬治六世對自治領之稱號亦將變更。英王之原有稱號，爲「不列顚及其海外自治領王喬治六世」今後當更爲「不列顚，加拿大，澳大利亞，南非，紐西蘭王」。</p>

<h3>日議會質詢漸見緊張　片山哲呼籲合作　吉田提出二黨政治問題</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京三日電〕第三日之日本國會，衆院由自由黨總裁吉由首先質問，要旨爲：（一）民主國家必須係採行自由經濟，尤需要適當之經濟政策，未知政府對此有何決定？（二）關於恢復對外貿易，政府是否有周到之準備？（三）目前最嚴重之問題厥爲失業對策及工業原料之轍入。政府於此有充分之準備否？（四）民主國家日本之政治，由健全之二大政黨主持，雖覺頗爲公道，但政府之路綫如何，頗願知其究竟。當由片山首相答辯稱：（一）以二大政黨主持政治，雖無不可，但目下仍欲舉國一致之合作，始能突破各方面之危機。（二）鑒於貿易之重要性，決心傾全力以求其進行順利。（三）原料輸入確屬必要，但須於和約會議後始能有所決定。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京三日電〕參議院中，關於土地改革及移民問題，片山答稱：土地改革欲廢除地主，需實行土地改革，再努力於基本問題之解決。</p>
<p>移民政策</p>
<p>移民問題，擬採取最適合於我民族之措施。繼由一松定吉提出關於民主主義，官價制度，糧食徴購等問題，提出質問。片山答稱：民主主義與全體主義異趣，係人民全體起而要求自由之運動。目前僅一部人享有自由，國民大衆則無自由可言，欲國民全體享受自由，則目前獨享自由之一部份人應忍耐犧牲其過份之自由。現已與國民公約，努力以求其實現。</p>

<h3>美經濟援韓正草擬計劃</h3>
<p>勒琪請貸五億四千萬元</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二日電〕馬歇爾國務卿頃談稱：美國經濟援助朝鮮之計劃，性質與援助希土二國相同，下正在草擬中，凖備提交國會討論。</p>

<h3>地方稅法修正財局大感困難　本市絕大多數住戶可免房捐</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據記者自有關方面探悉：中央此次修正吿種地方稅法中，關於房捐部份修正條例第六條免捐規定第二項，有「居民自用之房屋，每人未超過一間者」，亦予免捐。本市財政當局前次奉到此項新條例後，以本市房荒，正値嚴重時期，而海上復素稱寸金之地，居民自用房屋，每人未超過一間者甚多，倘予免捐，則影響稅收至鉅。經研究結果，認爲必係「一戶未超過一間」之筆誤，經於三月間電請財政部解釋，財政部亦認爲此項規定，不合實際情形，業經照案修正，呈由行政院轉准立法院咨復：「無庸修正」，是則仍應根據原修正條例免捐，惟財政部以茲事體大，攸關地方稅收，且有關全體市民負担亦大，仍在詳細，研討修正中。在未修正前，仍按照原訂免征標準辦理，即凡市民用屋每人未超過一間者，可免房捐。上項訓令，業已到達市財政局。然據記者確悉：財政局以此案關係地方稅收太鉅，且辦理極爲困難，因本市房荒如此嚴重，每人用屋未超過一間者佔絕大多數，換言之即本市有絕大多數住戶可以免繳房捐，故市財政當局，必將據理力爭，務請立法院照案修正云。</p>

<p>〔醫學博士唐仁縉答〕（一）須先檢騐血液，有無瘧疾原蟲存在。如係瘧疾，使用「規寗丸」或「阿的平」，須按照醫師一定服法，方能見效。有時注射砒素劑亦奏良效，總之須就診於醫師較爲妥當。</p>

<h3>壓力增加·投機退避　華股紛紛跌停　永紗美亞已做低至跌限以下</h3>
<p>華股昨以不利條件，若實行五成現金保證，限制用電，及拆除對講電話等，以致回天乏術，多頭祗能忍痛了結。跌風加强，中途雖有金融帮之逢低納現，及空方獲利抵補，稍有回風。無奈環境絕望，活動者退避三舍，塲內交易旣十分减低，塲外亦因當局之拆除對講電話，亦多規避，經不起存多了結。各熱股除跌至限度外，永紗美亞並做低至跌限之下甚多，’短時期中恐無回蘇之望。晨初開出人心已十分怯疲，各股咸開低盤。遞永紗以八七〇〇元低價上市，一般人心鑒於永紗增資，情况十分相宜，見低尙有補空者。開後即交永紗由一七二號一七三號九一號七六號一七七號買進，遞永紗由二四號一〇八號七三號二二四號吸收，逐漸回升到現交八四五〇元，遞交八九五〇元高價。</p>
<p>此時掉期貼價自三七〇元步昻至四五〇元，故即交永紗未能越過開盤價。三二號一六三號八五號乘高賣出現永紗，一六三號一四二號一九九號亦賣遞永紗，復吿不支。統益由一八〇號，現美亞由八九號，信和由一七號七三號一三三號，現永紗由三五號，遞美亞由一〇五號，現新光由一四二號，次第迫至跌停限度。遞永紗逐漸迫至八三九〇元跌停板。五四號二四號乘低吸納，遞永紗升至八五五〇元。此時七六號三六號一六〇號尙售，曾再低落至八四〇〇元光景。後經一七七號八號代銀行界吸收現永紗，九五號三一號亦納，二一八號九四號二二八號八號並進遞永紗，二一二號一三一號雖力售現永紗，爲數不少，十時後，現永紗回升至八三五〇元，遞永紗八七五〇元。九七號二三一號七〇號一七號脫售現永紗，一四號亦售遞永紗，八五號亦有了結。中絲由一六〇號掛低至跌停限度，遞永紗乃回落至八六〇〇元內。入後自十時半以迄十一時十五分，市况呆滯，成交寥落，即交永紗在八二五〇元，遞交紗在八六〇〇元左右，盤旋不定。無奈塲外息價仍開三角內外，而拆除電話加緊進行，證交當局並出通吿，令各經紀人萬勿再做塲外交易，人心仍怯。各次熱每况愈下，意興闌珊。十一時半，賣風又起，九四號二三號三五號一五七號均賣，現永紗由一五四號二〇三號，遞永紗由三二號二二三號，均掛跌停。遞新光由一三一號，永公由一九一號，均掛低至跌停板。此後即吿一蹶不振，永紗由二二三號六五號一四八號之脫售現永紗，跌至七七五〇元遞永紗跌至八〇五〇元。而現美亞四三〇元遞美亞四五〇元，都有成交。大通商務火柴中紡亦跌達限度，結果與封關前相較，計即交股永紗信和美亞新光永公景福跌停，華　動興中法新華各跌成半左右。商務火柴統益大通中絲均跌至限度，新亞跌落成半强，中紡跌停後有回，與內衣水泥麗安景綸各跌一成有零。遞交各股計永公跌落成半，永紗信和美亞新光景福均吿跌停，華豐跌落成半不到。塲外各老股計閘北華商中華南洋微降，大生五洲世界平平。</p>
<h3>統債與外股　成交均有限</h3>
<p>公債昨無人過問，經營者寥寥，是以祗有數十萬交易。統丙晨開八五〇〇元，由三六〇室脫手四十餘萬，即告低落至七三〇〇元，而後稍盤。結果較封關前計甲乙丙各跌四百元，統丁降六百元，統戊跌落七百元。在澈查黑市聲中，前途難以振作。</p>
<p>外股昨正常之交易臨時因有關當局之拆除對講電話而吿中止，活動不便，成交極爲有限。怡紗自設開八五〇〇〇元，中途降至八二〇〇〇元結束。結果較封關前計航業跌一成紙業所降殊微，餘股均跌半成左右，。</p>
<h3>套利交易　大為減色</h3>
<p>現遞掉期，昨永紗自三七〇元升至四五〇元，而後低至二七〇元，收市三〇〇元。一八五號一五六號二三一號貼出，而一七七號以及銀行帮一七八號五六號二〇七號四五號二二〇號一一號一四二號三一號一一二號紛加貼進。遞交因證金負担過重，乏人活動，成交不多。於十一時半後，降至低價，合息價自一角二至一角九不等。信和自九五三至一九〇元。新光自七元至八元半，華豐自五元半退至四元七角不等。</p>
<h3>證交禁止　對敲交易</h3>
<p>上海證券交易通告各經紀人云，査經營黄金美鈔交易，早經政府嚴令禁止，證券黑市對敲交易，亦屬有違法令。各經紀人多深明大義，知所戒懼，値茲政府嚴行取締之時，特甲警誡，切盼更自檢肅，免干懲處云。</p>
<h3>各地到貨不雞雞　食米賡續平疲　麺粉去化見旺再見低價</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧一萬石有零，來貨以長江上下游秈米最多，沙市漢口蕪湖安慶九江均有來貨，蘇北亦有到源。南市粳米下挫三五千至萬元，秈米亦跌萬元至萬餘元。白陰元仍然少神而乏交，客元最爲呆滯。北市趨勢平疲之格。</p>
<p>麵粉去化轉懈，急轉直下，在挫六七千元。麩皮亦小千元，豆餅銷令時期形勢活洛，步砌一二千元。黄豆市勢緊俏，續升二三千元。荼豆供求兩稀，市形平正。</p>
<p>赤豆去胃轉平，價格漲定。生仁市化見淡，亦成站局。芝蔴貨稀續堅，仍向高峯挺進。紅糧暗升，苞米北方不動，回低五六千元，中次狂跌萬元。蠶豆客帮本街互有納胃，堅穩之象。</p>
<p>油市以店胃進取不濃，交易冷懈。生豆油回疲萬元，蔴油疲平，靑油菜油亦跌萬元，熟菜油銷路甚呆。</p>
<p>粉廠貸款辦法未定</p>
<p>又訊：據麵粉廠業方面息：收購小麥貸款，申請至今未有確切消息，各廠亟盼糧食部決定貸款辦法，俾獲得充裕原料，維持生產。糧食部曾有貸款辦法多種，迄今尙無決定。因之貸款之事，一再延遲，目前各廠僅賴自由資金收購少量小麥，故生產時斷時續。昨日本市五大粉廠曾派代表向國家銀行接洽貸款，亦因當局貸款未有決定而未果，現該業正向當局催促中云。</p>
<p>大豆一批行將抵滬</p>
<p>中央信託局向東北訂購之大豆一萬噸，迄目前止僅運到二千四百噸，其餘因受東北戰事影響，進出口皆受限制，此項大豆遂亦無法出口。頃悉：該局東北分支機構，刻又設法自東北運出三千六百噸，本月中即可運抵來滬，尙餘四千噸，仍在設法裝運，運滬後即全部交榨油業榨製食油，調劑市面供銷</p>
<p>標售麺粉暹羅白米</p>
<p>中央信託局為處理水潰麺粉九十餘萬磅，及暹羅白劣米五萬餘市斤，特舉行公開標售，其辦法如次：（一）凡欲投標者，可逕向仁記路七四號三樓三二二室詢價組，索取「投標須知」（二）看樣期八日上午九時至十二時，下午二時至五時。（三）投標期限十日上午至十一時以前。（四）開標日期，十日上午十一時正。（五）底價開價前公佈。</p>
<h3>收購出口物資　新方案已決定</h3>
<p>輸出推廣委員會第十五次委員會議，一日在中央銀行會議室舉行，當日所討論之問題，未得結論。二日繼續開會，午後始吿結束。據悉該會此次所討論之議題有二：一爲收購出口物資問題，一爲生絲之購銷問題。關於前者，已決定新方案，送請財政部經濟部全國經濟委員會核定。關於後者，另組小組審査。聞今後之收購方式，將委託出口商辦理，期能達到官商合作，共謀困難之解決。該會陳副主任委員光甫，已於二日晚携帶收購方案晉京，與中樞有關各部洽商，俾能速迅打開目前之僵局。</p>
<h3>銀樓業代表向社會局訴苦</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕銀樓業因鑒於復業事拖延至今，中央迄無明令，長此以往，難以維持，而職工生計亦將斷絕。昨日下午乃推派代表表截艮。姚桂卿·陳德彰·吳彭年四代表晋見社會局吳局長，陳述告衷，請予轉呈中央，究竟有無辦法使予繼續維持。否則即乾脆解僱職工，免致拖累。吳局長允將此意於本周之市政會議中提出。</p>
<p>據吳局長語記者稱：渠將請吳市長在中央尙未批示前，趕速電呈中央，請予設法補救。蓋以全市銀樓業職工遠三萬餘人，如以三口之家計算，則一旦解僱，十萬人無以爲生，將成爲社會之嚴重問題。</p>
<p>據銀樓業中人稱：平時各銀樓銀飾銀具之營業，祗佔全部營業五十分之一，如單營銀業，實無法維持。况現今頗少有人兌換銀鐲銀戒而多戴佩金飾，且銀子亦難保不有黑市云。</p>
<h3>棉花市價下游</h3>
<p>昨日現棉市况，因棉紗開盤價疲，紗廠納胃甚懈，人心虛軟。本市存底雖薄，但連日各方報導，當局有抑制物價之決心，故進方勢成觀望。午後以棉紗收盤價略見好轉，紗廠徴有吸胃，客帮亦稍有添辦，市况疲中帶堅，交易稍旺。各檔做開計送廠價靈寳一九八萬，漢口粗絨一六〇萬。又棧交價計冲通州一五七萬，沙市一八五萬，靈寳一九〇萬。一九三萬，一九四萬至一九五萬，漢細一六四萬，通州一六二萬，漢口一六五萬，周浦籽花每組二六萬至二八萬。</p>

<h3>卅五年度受押箱茶　處理辦法決定　押款到期即應取贖不凖展延</h3>

<p>（一）卅五年度受押箱茶處理辦法：卅五年度茶貸總額，原係奉宋前副主席核定爲七十億元，各茶商於製成箱茶後，因國外市價低於國內成本，另又要求以箱茶七折作押，轉做箱茶押款，以期結束茶貸。當經於十一月間，由農民銀行與中央銀行商定，屢次增加押款，共計爲二百億元。在此次箱茶運滬將達一年，自應急謀疏銷，以免呆擱。今已決定處理辦法四點：（一）七月十日起，箱茶押款到期，絕對不准展期，各茶商如不備款取贖，應予處分押品。（二）各茶商得自即日起，至七月廿日止，向中信局申請收購箱茶，（三）收購箱茶在出口前，應由中信局商請主管機關，全部重加檢査，其不合標準者，不得出口。（四）卅五年度其他各地出口箱茶已運抵上海者，亦得此照本辦法申請，由中信局收購。</p>
<p>本年茶貸推進辦法</p>
<p>卅六年度茶貸總額二八〇億元已由農民銀行絡續貸款，其餘運銷貸款出口地點押款共五三九億元，應由農民銀行繼續核放。又政府對於主要出口物資，巳有收購計劃，茶葉亦爲收購對象之一。爲配合政府政策起見，經予核定推進辦法三點：（一）收購範圍，凡適合外銷標準之茶葉，茶商不能運銷出口者，統得收購。（二）收購價格，照產運成本加合法利潤，實施計算。由主辦機關，主持掛脾，（三）收購期限，凡向農民銀行借款之茶商，於到期時，無方備款取贖，得申請收購，以還借款，不得讀轉。其不願收購者，不得第二次續請收購。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕本年度江浙兩省絲繭貸款案，內收繭工作久已完成，現正趕辦乾繭進倉，已開始　絲，該處已經按照實際需要，核准繅工貸款云。</p>
<h3>香煙市氣轉挺</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟市况轉挺，開後塲內門莊帮需求頗股，喊價堅挺，蓋以多頭斬殺殆盡，賣，觀望，市勢上升。做開交易，以英美烟補買健旺，故至午市，結果十支大英烟每箱比隔昨回漲六萬元，爲七百三十六萬元。老刀燜升十萬，爲六百四十萬元。五華升三萬，哈德門升五萬元，其餘華商烟亦均帶好二三百元至二千元，惟銀行牌及克雷斯三貓等步小三五百元。美貨條烟平定，聽頭烟則一致微降。</p>
<h3>紗市先疲後堅</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市況，因當局厲行限價，並抽査紗布商號等，市塲人心虛怯，交易甚淸，塲外喊價開做，即有浮戶了結，價告下挫。近收時本街染織廠進取，並有見低收吸，價遂回升。廿支雙馬紗曾小至九百四十萬元，最後爲一千零十萬元，比之週一軋升二餘萬元。其餘除四二支及四〇支細紗微挫外，二十支及十六支十支等粗紗，挺升二三十萬元不一。</p>

<p>銀錢業上半年決算期，倏已過去。昨茶葉市况，內銷花色除本街店壯及蘇州帮，廣東帮，續有垂詢外，他若楓涇一帶之新買戶，亦趨前頻作染指，致市勢比假前活躍生色，行情亦亟穩秀，外銷茶依然僅午昌大德昌等茶葉公司尙在吸納，餘則未免猶豫，因此執貨者力圖鎭定，價未見墜。頃據業中人云：刻下法商永興洋行對於珍眉等綠茶，復與貨方磋商，如能獲得解法，或有相當成交云。</p>
<h3>肥皂賣多下挫</h3>

<p>— 余雲岫</p>
<p>范君守淵，他的眼底裏面，看不慣我國醫事的混亂和穢汚，提起横掃千人軍的筆桿來，在社會上大聲疾呼，已有二十年左右了。他現在把從前到最近的論著，分做五輯，就是第一輯言論，第二輯評議，第三輯漫談，第四輯常識，第五輯雜俎，彙合起來，刋行一部書，呌做「范氏醫論集」，要將出世了。我對了這部書出版，發生了兩種感想。</p>
<p>其一，就是我國社會老不進步。我們中國文化落後，差不多人人都曉得都承認，醫學也是文化之一，當然也是不會不落後的。曉得落後，承認落後，却沒有力量來推動它，改革它，統一它，　洗它，甚而至於還要更加攪亂它，這就是我們眼底裏所見不慣，而不能不大聲疾呼的事物。假使能使够澈底透視所以落後緣故，努力改善，迎頭趕上，那末這二十年當中，局勢一定會起了大大的變動，而范君大聲疾呼的音片，已經是陳言陳跡，好像沒有再來廣播的必要。可是現在站起來看看環境妄談空想哲學的仍舊如是，盲信庸俗經騐的仍舊如是，甩脈理來診病的仍舊如是，用湯頭來疏方的仍舊如是，而且對於醫政醫法方面，力爭均勢，對於學門資格方面，力求低劣，前者是用來防禦逼迫，後者是用來繁殖徒黨，完全把自己一部分的利益做了中心，對於國家的興亡，人民的利害，國際的聲望，學術的進退，　在腦後，不去睬他，這種作風，時髦流行得厲害，所以二十年來，進步停滯，仍舊是混亂和穢汚的本色。跟着，范君大聲疾呼的唱片，也歷二十年之久，好像還是嶄新，而有重來廣播的必要。在這一個感想之下，我不好意思替范君慶幸，而反要對社會哀弔一番。</p>
<p>其二，就是我國社會人士，太不懂得。我常常說，講話要對方有人，鍾子期是伯牙　琴的一個知音，鍾子期死了以後，伯牙就破琴不彈了，這段故事是我們所常用的，所以壯子有「大聲不里入於耳」的話。里耳就是庸耳俗目的意思。現在國人思想的幼稚，實在可以驚駭，現在還有墨守了六七世紀以前的玄學，當他做環寳的人們，方且夜郞自大，虛驕恃氣。這樣社會，忠吿他科學眞理，是不會降心平氣來聽我們的。根本的原因是不懂得我們的講話。范君大聲疾呼了二十年，得到共鳴的有幾個人？試看看醫事的停滯不進步，就可以測騐我們的話，得到幾許功效。餡牙破琴的舉動，眞是深刻地得到社會的反映。我有幾位同道，常以爲舊醫學的批評，是無益之舉，他們無非也感到沒有聽言之人。這樣社會，而范君偏要曉曉不休，熱心地廣播他的音片。在這一個感想之下，我沒有工夫替范　悲傷，而反要對社會痛哭流涕一下。</p>
<p>儘管社會頑鈍，儘管社會幼稚，范君也明曉得國人是難以喚醒的，也明曉得用力多而成功少，然而鍥而不舍，勞而不悔，這什麽緣故呢？我鄭重聲明一句；這是愛國的熱忱的表現，値得十二分敬佩的！晨門評價孔子說道：「是知其不可而爲之者艱」？這句話句含着多少的沉痛啊！</p>
<h3>談過敏性反應（Allergie）</h3>
<p>— 壽梧靑</p>
<p>最近滬籌報載醫師注射局部麻藥，電療　症，因奴佛客因（藥名）發生過敏性反應死亡一案，經檢察官洞察醫學原理，宣吿無罪，醫界稱快。査過敏性反應之意義，讀者未能理解其詳者，頗不乏人。萬一不幸而遭遇此種情形，病家每多誤會，引起醫務糾紛，甚或訴諸法院，引用業務過失致死條例，附帶民訴賠償，歸咎醫師，是不可不爲特異反應解釋者。</p>
<p>過敏性反應Allergy爲醫學上專門名詞，由病人之特異體質Allergic　Constition所造成。所謂特異體質者，乃非尋常之感應。某人因某種情狀下，發生異常之動態。換言之，無特異體質者，即無特異反應（或作過敏性反應）。醫藉中無特異體質之統計，而實際上每千人中至少有一二人。此種體質，富有先天遺傳性。由父而子而孫。由母而女而甥。但特異反應之輕度者，恒不爲病家所注意。如某人食蔬菜魚類蝦類等所引起之風疹塊（皮膚性）。食蛤蜊螺絲螃蟹等所引起之腹痛吐瀉症（胃腸性）。飲人乳牛乳之慢性涇疹（小兒奶癬）。他若食鷄蛋之哮喘病，及嗅花粉之枯草熱（神經性）。因各該食物所含之特種蛋白質，刺激患者之神經細胞，而引起異常之反應。</p>
<p>因藥物而引起特異反應者，不在少數。服微量阿四匹林出多量汙液者，服少量霹力米同而熱度驟降極低者；服奎艮發紅疹者；服　素發皮班者；服止痛　反覺頭痛更烈者；服少量安眼藥而沉眠多時者，飲大量黄酒，不但無酩酊大醉之現，而反興奮若狂者。凡此種種，僅述其特異反應之最微者。至若血淸注射，共過敏反應，長爲迅速。試以少量血淸，直接作肌肉注射，瞬息之間，面部浮腫，頭大若斗，眼臉口唇膨脹欲裂，喉頭聲門，全部水腫，呼吸困難，窒息靑紫。但垂危之白喉症，即有此種體質，若非謹愼注射自喉血淸，決難收痊愈之效。故現時傷塞病人，除必不得已外，已少採用血淸注射療法。即目下流行應用之配尼西林及肺病新　，對特異體質，亦有引起特異反應之可能。（如寒顫高　嘔吐皮疹等）。昔時曾聞牛奶肌肉注射，（頓挫療法）而引起極危險之特舉反應，注射亞姆乃丁電銀維他命B而致死亡者，凡此種種，皆因病人有特異體質，而發生特　反應所致也。</p>
<p>總之，過敏反應，因特異體質而起。特異體質，乃為人體過敏反應，由神經系統發育不健全，感應異常為素因。此種素因，未可以質量形容之：更不能以守席電感化學方式等測騐之。醫師於倉卒臨診之間，更難預知。惟在日常不知不覺之間，偶爾發見此種類似之感應。若旣已發生，則立刻救治。輕症自無問題。嚴重病症，挽救無術表，醫師難負其責。過去不幸之事實，或可重見於將來，若以醫學眼光準之，未可爲特異反應異。</p>
<h3>恐水病</h3>
<p>— 辰員</p>
<p>恐水病，乙是瘋犬病的別名。年來各種醫刋，雜誌上論列的已多；現在更把病名方面提出談談，想亦不致認爲多餘的吧。就是第一，「瘋犬病」爲什麽還要呌做「恐水病」呢？其實一病二名的先例，正復不少！譬如瘧疾，不是也稱間隙熱麽？瘧疾一名，固屬傳統的本名；而間隙熱，却指其一種特微，完全用癥狀委命名。因爲大家對它，莫不爲之首肯，所以，二假重疊稱謂，至今並行不悖。以此類推，則恐水病和瘋犬病，意亦相同。瘋犬病可日爲傳統的命名；而恐永病則可目爲症狀的命名。這因為瘋大病人所表現的症狀，其中最可令人注意：和最初先顯的；尤其是病犬或病　所無，惟有人類染了瘋犬病後所獨有的；就是這恐水現象。說到症狀的命名，令人望文思義，而覺一見其名，自然了解其病的便利。先說瘧疾吧；其發熱有時間性。凡在發作的一天有熱；休息的一天無熱。因其先一發熱，和後一發熱之間，隔着一定時日，所以間隔一日而再發熱的，又名三日熱。間隔二日而再發熱的，又名四日熱。眞覺形容的當，令人萬分醒目。現在把恐水病去形容犯瘋犬病的人，要亦同然。因爲病人在發病中看見任何流質，一定要引起咽部肌肉的痙攣。不但無法將此流質嚥下，送達食道。並且形狀萬分痛苦，好像流質是病人畏物。可是環境中，又何能遠離流質。尤其是水，爲人生不可須臾離的；欲令病人，不和水接近，又豈可能？所以犯了瘋犬病的病人，定有恐水症狀，，爲人發見。就此給它別名，呌恐水病，誰也認爲當然。其實恐水症狀，不過普通病人，嚥下困難的一種現象吧了！其所不同的普通咽喉都患病，對於液體初尙勉强可飲。一定要等待病重，才對於流質，也無法下嚥。而恐水病，則自始即不能飲水。且在病初，對於一切固形食物，也許尙可呑嚥；越是見到流質，越覺爲難。尤其在服藥時候，最形狼狽。有許多病人，被人發覺其爲恐水病，就是從飲藥困難而起呢！</p>
<p>第二恐水症狀，旣屬瘋犬病人的特徵。在吾國古時，却並未有人提出論述。翻遍古籍，也少具體記載，眞令人難信。反而社會間，流傳着怪誕不經的謬說。一尤其在村媼野老的口中，獨多迷信。譬如說「人爲瘋犬咬傷後，腹中生子犬」咧，至今還深入人心。似此在各級社會裏，以訛傳誤着，眞敎人何從索解！就常識而論，人類而可以懷犬胎，固屬笑話。就是犬類自族方面，其　雄交配，亦何能舍生殖器官而不由。更萬無因口咬齒嚙，而便懷孕之理。若此荒謬絕倫的造作，不知始自何人？但從未有人出而懷疑；可是亦從未有人爲之證實，足見社會間，盡是人云亦云之輩。因此可以想到，古人觀察力，萬分薄弱。像瘋犬病，的確可說它是。一種絕症，大家早應詳察，早應推究。如果古人能周到注意，那麼像　水症狀，早應被人發覺，那會　視若無覩呢？而現在把其著明唯一的特徴，竟會忽略過去，豈不可憾！以作者推測，這完全是古人的糊塗。因爲恐水症狀，在病人初期，神識淸楚時候，已經表現，但病人心理上，却並無見水恐怖的自覺。因爲病人並不自認視水爲長物，故傍人也不以爲意了。後來病勢增劇，不但見水而會引起咽部肌肉的痙　；同時咀嚼各肌，也跟着痙擊。因此病人雖不能進飲食；而外觀上，反可以見發見其空嚥空嚙等無意識動作。更進一步，也可以發見咬傍人，咬器物等失常狀態。此時和瘋犬猖狂的現象，幾乎相近。大家正注意其神經症狀的發展，自不及追究恐水和不恐水的關係了！</p>
<p>第三恐水症狀，在瘋犬病人是否必發？這問題，當然已不必懷疑。凡患瘋犬病的，一定會表演這種症狀。因爲瘋犬病毒發作時，首先被侵及的，就是咽頭部各種肌肉。此時該部神經，異常過敏。稍稍興奮，便起痙攣；因此食物被阻難嚥。尤其對於飲料，格外難於下　。後來痙攣的範圍漸漸推廣，咀嚼肌；顏面肌；甚至全身肌肉，都起痙攣。而意識亦漸漸消失，遂成瘋狀。然而病勢尙進行不已，最後則變爲麻痺。一時似乎瘋狀减輕，病有起色。各部痙攣靜止；嚥下作用，也不覺困難，略能進些流質，神識和精神，也安頓許多。可是好景不常，不久全身元全入於麻　狀態；因此心臟和呼吸齊止，而終於不救。其能免於死的，今尙未有所聞。不過在事實上，亦有少數病人，一發病就入麻痺狀態。任何痙攣現象，都未及表現，而已失其生命。這種當然是極重的重症；和別種傳染病的電擊型；有些近似？</p>
<h3>五官器的生理衛生（下）</h3>
<p>— 白丁</p>
<p>（二）目的衛生：目即是看東西的眼睛。目在全體的重要，較耳爲尤。沒有這一雙圓圓的眼睛，我們便什麽東西不能看，就是瞎子。有了眼睛，如眼睛的組織機能有了妨碍損傷，也照樣的或減少視力，或失盲。現在來寫幾條如何保護眼睛的衛生吧。一，眼宜保護，勿使外界塵埃煤煙吹入；若已吹眼中，即宜速行設法取出：取出之法，勿以手摩擦，以免損傷眼球的角膜，應暫行閉眼，任牠流涙，　埃煤煙等異物，即可隨涙出的，不然，或把眼臉上翻，用淸凈的棉花或筆毛之類，輕取之。地，在夏日强烈的日光下，勿過張大眼睛，或用顏色的護眼限鏡，以免强光的刺激；勿由深暗地方驟至光明之處。三，手巾及毛巾應谷人自備，以免傳染砂眼（此可參閱拙作怎樣預防砂限一文）。四，睡眠須有一定時間，且勿使失眠；因睡眠時間過短，或睡而不眠的失眠，均能妨礙眼睛。這是關於眼的幾條保護法衛生法。</p>
<p>（三）鼻的衛生：因鼻司　覺，故亦可說是嗅覺的衛生。亦有相當的重要，而且每爲一般人所忽視。現亦列出幾條關於此項的衛生規條。一，過於強烈的香臭，都不宜久嗅，因嗅之旣久，每能麻卑嗅神經，使之失正常之效。二，紙烟勿宜濫吸，因能使嗅覺遲鈍之故。三，勿從冷處驟入熱處，或過熱之處，忽入過冷之處，因能使鼻閉塞，甚至得感冒傷風等症。四，理髪時，勿剃鼻毛，因鼻毛爲鼻的長好保護器，可阻擋異物直入，又可作爲調節呼吸時的空氣氣溫之用。五，平日如遇在空氣乾燥之時，宜以濕布或溫水拭拂鼻腔內面。六，鼻部偶爾受傷出血，宜設法止之。其法有二：（一）爲消極的方法，用柔軟的紙或棉花塞於鼻孔，同時，頭部須仰臥，並用冷水的濕毛巾放置額部；（二）爲積極的辦法，注冷水於鼻腔之內，使血管在逐漸收縮的狀態，血亦可自行停止。如仍不停，宜速就醫治之，以兔延誤。</p>
<p>（四）舌的衛生；這少少的一塊舌頭，也要講講牠的衛生。所謂舌的衛生，即是如何保護舌的嚐味功用的衛生。亦照橡分列數條如下：一，食物茶水的過冷過熱，都要妨礙味覺，首宜注意。二，咀嚼時，須當心咬破舌頭，這也是飲食嚼味時的煞風景事情。三，烟酒過量，都能促使味覺遲鈍，好烟愛酒的靑年朋友，應得注意。四，食物的偏於物一味亦易使成習慣性，而遲鈍其味覺功用的。五，有舌苔時，往往不易辨出食物的味道；至發生舌苔的機會，除疾病時之外，平時以夜工作或夜娛樂的醒夜，亦常爲發生舌苔的機會。嗜馬雀朋友，有留意的必要。</p>
<p>（五）皮膚的衛生：這在前文排泄衛生中，曾經說過，可以參看上文便了。然這在某種職業的人，就須注意到作爲觸覺之用的皮膚或感覺機能了。如我們做醫生的，能從隔着皮膚肌肉來診察內臟的情形，即是一例。如又娛樂方面，一般嗜好馬雀的人，常用手指尖頭，摸出東北風，三六洞，亦可爲證。</p>
<h3>衛生界的人事與待遇</h3>
<p>— 余正行</p>
<p>有人說：「中國是因人設事事，外國是因事用人一。可見中國社會以人事爲中心，中國行政方面，是看人與人的關係，是否相處安好？而不是機構與機構是否密驟。所以事業舉辦的成敗，是　「人」，而不是看機構，計畫或辦法。自然，「人存政舉，人亡政息」，被奉爲經典了！</p>
<p>中國社會中不單有派，派中還有系系內，還有小組。甲派得勢，乙派被棄，乙派登台，甲派則遭罷黜。所以「一人得勢，萬人享福」。這種現象的存在，只徒加重雙方的猜妄，彼此的矛盾，與力量的抵銷。對於事情只增加糜爛的深度，並沒有分毫補益。這是應該打破的。</p>
<p>我們時常到同樣的人，得到不同的待遇。在同一地區，可能在甲機關敍級高，而乙機關則反是。在不同的地方。自然更不同了。往往地方與中央之間，相差亦十分懸殊，固然這是獎勵前進地方工作之辦法，但級位差數過大，實足以紊亂人事的制度。我也贊同獎勵地方工作老，但却反對破壞一個制度的完整性。尤其是許多人利用派系關係，或者裙帶關係，所享受的待遇則又不同。這是爲有志者所唾棄，有血性者認爲可恥！</p>
<p>在整個衛生界，待遇的問題，顯出不平。事實上一般的待遇已經低落，是勿庸諱言的。但有些按薪給標準加百分之三十，百分之五十，有些則分文莫名。我們還看到，在同一機關內，因工作部門不同，有予以增加者。這種不平的待遇，擺設在眼前，多少總會刺戟工作情緒，影響工作效率，其最低限度會被認爲衞生界不是腐化，便是官僚。前途之無望可見。</p>
<p>屬稿于此，以管見所及，作下列數點建議：</p>
<p>一，重人材不常派　：現在謂我引胡定安先生的話，以爲已見。學術無國界，眞理無兩岐。從事學術工作者，首須有恢寬的胸襟，謙抑的心懷，屛除意氣，虛心抉擇，所謂：「白可受采，甘可受和」。而况在我國現狀下，醫學人材如此之少，社會需要如此之切，民衆疾苦待拯如此之殷，醫學學術需求吸入如此之渴，更應國結力量，集中意志。在同道間不可有優越之感，不可有偏狹之見，應有公允之誠，應有合理之策，减少趨炎附勢之幼　行爲，增進和藹可親之友愛情緒。本「學問深時意氣平」之風度，廣事聯繫，爲醫學學術而一掃以往派系觀念和險影，現在是應當顯現「雲消消烟散，日出天靑」，所謂天下一家的光明態度了，選賢任能，使人得其事事宜其人，爲今後用人策略。而不能再如以往，勞逸不均，權衝不平，而使事業牽肘</p>
<p>二，建立新人事制度：選賢任舟　之基，首在知人善用，用人又在公允合理。今日把「私」字放在開頭，致小人倖進，賢者遠進。在醫藥衛生界，今後要樹立好的風紀，人事制度必須重建。一方面保障其職業，一方面確定其職能。俾使一技術人員，在工作上，不會因私人意氣，而遭到擯棄。在待遇上，甲地可享受此一待遇，乙地亦可得到同等待遇，不會有甲地過高，乙地過低的情形。同時並應防制投機取巧的人，找機會，求倖　。不論中央與地方均一律平等，無特殊可言。自然，爲獎勵地方工作者，予以特別補助，特別津貼，則又當別論。但其基本原則，並不容許有可動搖，而應該全國上下一致，不再分歧。</p>
<p>三，獎勵後進青年：許多人自視爲愛謹靑年，培育靑年，提拔靑年，其實是最不了解靑年，甚至利用靑年，摧殘靑年。其結果，靑年多意志消沉，許多有理想，有希望的靑年，心地善良，不幸横遭折磨，變成「少年老成」的灰色態度，放棄了希望，丢開了理想，與世沉浮，因循茍且。我們認爲這不單是靑年本身的不幸，而且是社會的不幸，事業的不幸。因此，對於一個新靑年，認其有作爲，有造就，有前途，必須敎導，扶持，淘鑄，使成爲有希望，有更大成就的人。一個人的年齡實在有限，在新舊交替的過程中，事業的延續，理想的發掘，必須靠後進靑年的努力。因此，培育後進靑年是應當的，也是必須如此作，對中國醫藥衛生事業前途才有希望四，提高醫事人員待遇：「餓不死，吃不飽，凍不死，穿不暖」，這成爲公家服務人員的口頭　。但子女衆多的，却有餓死，凍死之虞。五月前有一位三十一年才畢業的醫師，表示願爲國家衛生工作服務，酬勞不計，職位不拘，但不能全部從公。因他每日三小時開業，每月可以收入四百萬元。這正說明技術人員待遇太低，日常生活不能維持，雖有心爲政府服務，爲了「生活」，亦不能不自謀出路，作開業的打算。所以，希望政府對於技術人員，酬勞必須從豐。「要想馬兒好，又要馬兒不吃草」這是辦不到的。如果呌一個技術人員，爲衣，食，住惴惴不安，他還有心硏究，發明，或安心診治病人，實在是癡人說夢。開明的行政當局，應使這醫樂衛生技術人員生活安定，使他們寬心的爲事業而努力。同時也只有如此，才可以羅致優秀的幹才。將來實行公醫制度，管理開業，取締開業，而不改善待遇，恐怕仍歸失敗。快整改善並安定醫事人員主　吧！</p>
<p>「用一個作事的，比用十個吃飯的高明」。講求工作效率，希望事業發展，不論在人事上，或者在待遇上，用高價得到一個幹練的人材，比「平價」的蠢豬，所收獲的利益高。所以，今後在人事上，不但應選賢任能，獎善罰惡，而且要培育幹材，招徠幹材。不論在制度上，設施上，或者待遇上，都應該給幹材賜予方便。如此重才，則衆心向上，求實際，而不好虛名，建設事業自然有希望。</p>
<p>上面所談，或有人認爲是整個中國社會問題，而不單爲醫藥衛生界如此。整個社會未見改善，單方努力，希望恐微。我認爲這是「因循」的思想在作崇，這是同汚合鳥的想法。如果醫藥衞生界，以一種學術的事業集團，不首先改正，以作示範，而以整個社會爲藉口，實在說明自己不長進。而這種不長進，存在學術事業的集團中，可恥！</p>
<p>爲了給公醫制度的推行，舖上一條坦途，要求人事制度的合理化，要求醫事人員的待遇提高，這是天經地義的。愛護民族健康的政府當局，注意國家富强的立法先生，注意，注意改善吧！</p>

<h3>「太平天國狀元」王韜及其著述</h3>
<p>— 沈定鈞</p>
<p>曾為本報蒐輯聚珍版叢書</p>
<p>王韜原名畹，字利賓，號蘭君，一作蘭卿，又號子九。後在自傳中，又說初名利賓，旋改名瀚，字懶今。吳長州人，世居甫里。他應的科試，却入的是新陽籍，所以在崑新靑袊錄中，有王瀚的題名，他在上書太平軍事發覺後，就改名韜，字紫荃（一作銓），號仲弢，晚年遯跡粵東，自號天南遯叟。生於淸道光八年，（公元一八二八年）卒於光緒十六年，（公元一八九〇年）存年六十三歲。父名希賢，號友芝，也是新陽茂才。母朱氏，生二子一女，韜居次，姊適吳郡某姓，弟名桂卿，壯年短折，遺寡婦孤兒各一。王韜原配楊氏字夢蘅，繼室林氏，自歸王韜後，韜爲她改名懷蘅，以示不忘前妻之意。楊氏爲里人釆汀孝廉之女，薪團茂才之妹，這一段王楊戚誼，現在連楊姓後人也不能詳知了。韜祇有一女，無子，女嫁烏程錢姓，後來就把女兒之子爲孫，喚做幼銓。</p>
<p>他在少年時代，眞是貧病交迫，凡屬藥珥等一切費用，都靠他母親的典質籍餌，及勤苦紡績來供給。他很喜讚書，曾和里人許起（字壬瓠）同受業於錦溪　滌　明經門下。（有條　詩鈔，亦爲里人，時適處館錦溪，錦溪爲陳墓的別名。）韜性狂放，目空一切，年二十二歲，遭父喪，家這益貧困，就隻身赴滬，在英人麥都思所辦之墨海印書局服務，職位很低，悒悒寡歡了幾年。</p>
<p>王韜在十九歲那年，金陵應試不中，便廢葉帖括，奮志經史；不過性好冶游，在金陵應試時，便與任素琴，繆愛香兩校書結識，在淮上見了名妓荷香及素卿，又不覺心醉起來。他在自撰的「豔史叢鈔」序中，也說：「余少時好爲側壓之句，涉筆即工，』的話。他所著的「蘅華館詩錄」紀夢詩中有句云：「碧宇紅牆原咫尺，重來未必隔人天。」又　興云：「新著單紗還怕熱，偸揩香汗避生人。」這兩詩都很旖旎，在二十四歲那年，狎邪之遊更甚，選花徴歌無虛日，狂名著於一時。他的「海陬治遊錄」自序中也說：「辛亥（咸豐九年）春間，稍作綺遊，狂名頓著，選花開尊，徴歌按拍，題裙索扇，間有文章，抹月批風，任傳薄倖；於是沾泥之絮，遂爲逐水之萍矣。」讀了上面的詩和文，可見他的　情綺思了，</p>
<p>王韜在早年時應試不第，很一是鬰鬰，又値淸政的腐敗，太平車的聲勢日甚，便在同治元年，用「黄畹」兩字爲名，上書太平天國的忠王李秀成，勸他與外國稱和，藉外力以圖中原，並獻襲取上海之策。可惜忠王不予採用，但從此遂有了「太平天國狀元王韜』的誤傳。後來他所上的書，爲淸軍攻破七堡壘時所得，便下令嚴緝，他就避逃到上海，得到西人慕西士的保護。復應西友理雅各之召，在這年八月，携了家眷，逃至粵東，後來又窩居了香港兩年。同治六年，復偕西友理雅各，至英之蘇格蘭，譯訂中國經籍，後復遍遊泰西各國，很受彼邦人士的歡迎。同治九年歸國，仍匿跡香港，不敢回里。同治十二年，香港「循環日報」創刋，任該報編纂，光緒五年，遊日本，與東瀛文人往來很密。光緒八年返滬，曾回里一次，與許起等暢叙別情。隔了兩年，由香港移家至滬，任申報館編纂職務，並在滬創辦木刻活半印書局，名弢園書局。—許起所著的「刑瑚舌雕談」，便用該局的木刻活字印刷的。光緒十三年。已年屆花甲，任上海格致書院院畏，一反從前書院的以經史課士，敎人致力於科學，很想爲國儲材，把腐敗的淸廷轉弱爲强。</p>
<p>王鞱到了晚年，見世事日非，便　意於著述，我們試把吳縣志的「藝文考」翻開檢閱一下，便見王韜的著錄，約有三十餘種，三百七十多卷，不但可說是著述等身，而且更學貫中西哩。茲將他所著的書，錄之於後：</p>
<p>春秋左氏傳集說六十卷，春秋朔望　月考三卷　春秋日食辨正一卷　春秋朔望表一卷　皇淸經解校勘記二十四卷　四溟補乘一百二十卷　國朝經籍志八卷（一作十二卷）　華英通商事略一卷　臺事竊憤錄三卷（一作四卷）　瀛壖雜志六卷　重訂普法戰紀二十卷　南北美洲戰紀十二卷　西古史四卷　西事凡四卷　重訂法國志略十二卷（一作二十四卷）扶桑遊記六卷（一作三卷）漫遊隨筆八卷（附圖說）　淞　漫錄十二卷（附圖　）甕牖餘談八卷　遯窟講言十二卷　老響贅語人卷　重學淺說一卷　火器流三卷　西國天文源流一卷　光學圖說一卷　格致新學提綱一卷　泰西著述考一卷　蘅華館詩六卷　眉珠　詞鈔四卷弢園尺牘續鈔八卷　弢園尺牘十二卷　　園文錄外編十二卷。</p>
<p>又國立北平圖書館，藏有王韜手刋七册，內有東遊稿計錄及　華館日記，讀書隨記的斷片稿。（見北平臘醫館館刋）以上各　，我所目擊的，僅有幾種，而光緒九年他所著的華陽散稿序，會觀；「前歲一炬，余生平著述，半付刧灰。』照此看來，王韜的著作，一定散佚不少，難竊全豹了。</p>
<p>綜觀王韜的一生，雖少時貧困，中年逋逃，晚境頽膚，不克發展他的抱負，齊志以終，而所結識的朋友，都是中外著名之士。足迹所經，除新大陸外，都有他的雪痕鴻爪。而且著述這樣的豐富，實足敬佩。眞是一代的怪傑！他在私人生活方面，雖好治遊，但朋輩勸他納妾以續後嗣，他郤竭力的反對，主張一夫一妻之制。又對於科舉時文竭力鄙薄，雖或因應試不中有感而然。但鑒於國事之日非，帖括之無用，在舉國滔滔認爲可作進身之階的事業，竟敢公然反對，也足見其膽識的非常。不過在上平天國書敗露以後，他還曉曉的屢次自辯，有所希冀，那就未免太覺熱衷於名利了。</p>
<p>案王韜曾爲本館蒐輯聚珍版叢書。「遯窟　言」自序有云：</p>

<h3>談文藝批評</h3>
<p>— 胡廣東</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>在文藝作品貧乏的中國肚會，作為促進文藝作品內容的任務的文藝批評，也同樣地顯得荒蕉的，目前的文藝批評的毛病，在於批評精神的不够，換言之，即批評家的態度不够客觀，不够熱情。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>魯迅說談過：「我們所需的是堅實的，明白的，眞僅得社會科學及文藝理論的批評家』，的確的，假如一個文藝批評家，他的修養，短少了肚會科學的認識，不懂得文藝作品的肚會生活的因素，那末，我可以担保，他的發掘工作，一定是低能的，遲鈍的。</p>
<p>一個批評家，要具備的條件是一種服務的人生觀科學的世界觀，這可以說是批評的武器，眞理的測量器。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>創作家是工人，批評家是導師，這所謂導師，並不是熱情衰退的冬烘先生，而是保有豐富的素養與熱情的人，由於他的力量，可以給文藝工作者，指出應走的方向。</p>
<p>對於戰士們的作品的價値的發掘，這可以說是批評家的主要任務，施耐庵的『水滸』，曹雪芹的『紅樓夢」，魯迅的『阿Q正傳』，歌德的『浮士德』，高爾基的『母親』等等，像這些作品，它之所以能成爲人民心目中不朽的作品，便是從批評家們反復的批評中得到的成果，也可以說，這是批評家的發掘的結果。</p>
<p>批評家，是敏感於一般的讀者。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>那些講手段的人，不能成爲批評者因爲批評，決不是捧得上天，或是壓得入地的能度，而是極公正的嚴肅的剖析。</p>
<p>批評是具有深度的，浮光掠影的皮層的批評文字，在價値上說，是等於零的。批評家是站在科學的客觀的判斷上，對於文藝作品發射出無比的熱量與情感出來的。</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>在道沈滯的社會裏，我們期待着有好的作品，有堅實的客觀的文藝批評出現。</p>

<p>池塘</p>
<p>小小的池塘，亮晶晶的池塘，綠得可愛的池塘呵。—</p>
<p>這幾天來，這池塘出落得多麽美麗，多麽迷人。這池塘，隨着季節的更替，隨着蓬勃而豐美的夏日的蒞臨而變得如此美麗，如此迷人了。</p>
<p>池塘畔的小灌木覆蓋它以濃鬰的淸冷的綠蔭。綠萍開出白色的小花，疏疏落落的綴滿了一整個池塘。新生的魚兒，成羣的來水面游嬉，一點沒有顧忌。侵晨傍晚，這池塘更是成畏了的善歌的靑蛙們的樂壇，在此播送着熱烈的夏日的讚歌。……</p>
<p>我說池塘是一扇典雅的季節的小窗。在此蓬勃而豐美的夏日蒞臨的辰光，池塘就充滿了生命，充滿了顏色和聲音。</p>
<p>湖泊</p>
<p>湖泊是大地的眼睛，宇宙的明鏡。</p>
<p>初夏的湖泊，綠水盈盈。初夏的湖光，亮麗得使人睜不開眼睛。</p>
<p>湖泊有着它開豁的暢朗的心胸，一切都能包涵：</p>
<p>一座山，一角亭，一片雲，一張帆，一隻飛鳥，一朶落霞，都能或久或暫的在這裏投下它們的踪影。</p>
<p>生長在湖泊邊的子民是愛湖泊前；湖泊也愛着生長在它左近的這些子民。</p>
<p>湖泊照映着湖泊邊子民的生活：安貧樂道。湖泊和湖泊邊子民的運命是維繫在一塊兒的。</p>
<h3>雨燕雙飛</h3>
<p>— 謝采琴</p>
<h3>小院</h3>
<p>— 宣建人</p>
<p>小院，種了些花：的名字，我找不淸，但　色彩有紅的，黄的，紫的，白的，……爭艷呢。蝴蝶，蜻蜓，飛來飛去，小院，怪不寂寞。隣院探過頭來的核桃樹，碧綠的葉子，枝頭上結着靑靑的果實，三個，兩個……惹人愛。</p>
<p>淸晨，我看花；花上有顆顆晶瑩的露珠，花開花落，人生又何嘗不如此？說是花能解語？我的憂鬰，花也能懂得嗎？　夜晚，我在小院裏乘凉，牆角落的虫聲唧唧，啓示我生之煩惱。我想起那一串失去的彩夢，我嘆息。</p>
<p>猛抬頭，滿天星斗。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　333</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>原來這時，美情報部，探明這個碼頭工人，就是德闕第三皇子，價値重大，換回四位將級軍官，原也値得，並且德國口氣很鬆，還可增添代似。但美國情報部却另有打算，倒不在乎些微添價，却是要求德國把四名俘將，先運交瑞士外交部看待，一面却暗中做了手脚，秘密委派了一位頂尖諜探脚色，裝作不懂一句德文的下級軍官，偸偸摸摸地把那位三皇子，從囚禁所裏放了；條件是伴送三皇子，一路混回德國，除了酬金，還要一個軍職。</p>
<p>其時，德國在美國的間諜網，佈置得相當嚴密，只要能走出因禁所，那逃回德國的話，不成問題。何况美國情報部，還特別予以便利，讓他們偸到一部小型飛機，飛到墨西哥，再坐火車到南美巴西；到了巴西，自有德國專派潛艇迎接回國。</p>
<p>美國情報部爲什麽要這麽幹呢？原因就在把這位頂尖的諜報脚色，輕輕易易，由第三皇子，夾帶赴德，還當他是個大恩人。從此潛踪柏林的美諜，就多了一支生力軍，並且還可出入禁衛森嚴的德國軍部。（此亦單綫式行動）。</p>
<p>這裏提到遍一段，就是要說明特等諜探「單綫」人員，一個出塲，必有一種定型姿態。譬如德國第三皇子，是以下級社會，如碼頭工人的定型出塲，改名換姓，潛踪碼頭工人羣裏。但在德國高級間諜總部的册籍中，對這第三舉子，必有一個名目，也必有一個註脚。這個名目和註脚，除了掌管間諜的部長之外，爲了嚴守秘密和保護諜探的安全，內部機密，任何人都不能知道，只有總部這條單綫，一直牽到國外。至於美國派遣的這位諜探，也是以軍人賣國的奸細定型出塲。知道這事的，也只有最高機構和部長一人；雖然這奸細賣國的臭消息，當時鬧得滿城風雨；僅是烟幕作用。</p>
<p>但要曉得，用這種姿態，派出諜探的動作和手續，倒是比較簡單；可是一聲出了毛病，需要營救的時候，這個秘密訓令是怎樣傳達出去呢？照局外人拿電影和小說的眼光看，認爲利用無綫電密碼，或其他傳訊方式，把訓令遞到國外出事的所在地，就算成功。然而實際上哪有進等便宜簡單的事？何况軍事手續，最爲複雜，而諜探行動，和訓令傳達，比較軍事，尤其複華。</p>
<p>傳達訓令，當然有澦先佈置的方式，可以不去說牠。只這訓令的措辭，究竟是怎樣的形式？第一要點，自然必須密碼。這個密碼，就這等容易利用嗎？一要不着痕跡、二要淸楚肯定，三要簡短，這三個條件，就夠麻煩了。唯一能符合這三個條件的辦法，就要會利用代名假借方式，就像代數學利用ABC和XY一樣。</p>

<h3>美獨立紀念</h3>
<p>— 十郎</p>
<p>今天是美國獨立紀念，我們想用這篇短文，藉誌慶賀之意。</p>
<p>美國人解去民族的的束，以堅忍的毅力戰勝英國，宣布獨立，到現在已有一百七十一年的歷史。</p>
<p>美國人—這個光榮的民族，値得欽佩的地方，是在她的豪放，爽朗；她從不畏懼，艱難；她也從不爲險阻低頭。在二次大戰中，因了她得天獨厚的環境與豐富的資源，使阿美利加在今天，馬首是瞻，領導着全世界民族，向自由，和平的世界邁步。</p>
<p>但全世界現在都有一種隱憂，以爲美蘇衝突不可免，第三次更殘忍，更冷酷的世界大戰一定會爆發。以現在國際間火藥氣氛的濃郁，與美蘇間外交週旋塲合中的針鋒相對，措詞强硬，使世界每一處的神經末梢，都有着一種可怕的預感：</p>
<p>「戰爭是不能避免了吧」！</p>
<p>每一着棋子，每一個步驟，和每一個角度上，都現出美蘇劍拔弩張的姿態。</p>
<p>戰爭的彩態眞的形成了麽？才從壕暫裏洗去了解血，身心遭受創傷的戰士們，又得跨上另一次戰塲麽？</p>
<p>這個，似乎太殘酷了。爲着保持世界的進步與人類的文化，美國人與她賢明的領袖，是有　變重的責任，來解除當前這個陰霾滿布的靡障！</p>

<h3>孔子之教未落伍</h3>
<p>— 金長康</p>
<p>前幾天讀了魯氏先生的周公與孔子一文之後，引起我無限的同情。我們看到今天下所以禍患興作，就是因爲孔敎不尊，孔經不明的緣故。這是事實，非思想的落伍。何以故？因爲孔子爲人道正義而喊吶！</p>
<p>本着三才的眞理來作經立敎，制平天下大法，非爲一己傳文章。要知天下的眞理，只有一個。惟其是眞理，惟其只有一個，所以無時間性，無種族性，無區域性。故孔子經敎，語大天下莫能載，語小天下莫能破，放諸四海而準，卓立天地間，可爲萬世的師表，其義在斯。</p>
<p>我們更須認識孔子之敎，是敎人循遵着人道的眞理，來促進人類的進步，創造大同與和平的世界，絕無落伍的色彩）。中席云：「子曰：而好自用，賤而好自專，生乎今之世，反古之道。如此者，烖及其身者也。」說得何等透澈。第顧自孔子之世直到現今，此界上循環相殺，已由局部進展到整個世界。殺人的科學，已由　昧發明到幾將消滅整個世界的威力。此種人相食的演進，皆由於自用自專所造成。且較洪荒野蠻時代，更野　萬分，摧毀了人道的義路，開闢了明進暗退理智落伍的魔道。凡此，皆非孔子經敎所許，故貶爲愚賤之流。所謂「生乎今之世，反古之道。如此者，烖及其自身者也」就是孔子的進化論。其要點，在敎人不要開倒車。但是孔子敎人不要開倒車，是有標準的絕不盲從。所以並不把新舊二字來做是非的定論。故曰；「溫故而知新。」這樣才不至因新而抹煞眞理。</p>
<h3>夏夜—話流螢</h3>
<p>— 𣏌人</p>
<p>夜間和孩子們在園子裏乘凉，螢火蟲飛來了一閃一閃的光芒，孩子們爭着用蒲扇去撲，撲了許多，放在瓶裏，當作玩具。</p>
<p>大孩子是愛讀書的，向小姊妹們講了車胤臺蟹照讀的故事，她們不信，說：「螢火這一點小光如何可以照着讀書呢」？大孩子說：要提得多，古人說，「聚蚊可以成雷」，那我們也可以聚螢成電呀」。我聽了「聚螢可以成電」的這個新成語，不覺笑了起來，心想也不枉他在高中讀了兩年了。一個小女孩正在小學五年級讀書的，纏着我也要講一個關於螢的故事。</p>
<p>我忽然想起袁世凱弄螢的怪事來，便向他們說：「我所講的，和你們哥哥講的恰巧相反，袁世凱幼年最怕讀書，老師打他，他恨老師，就暗自生心要害老師一下。有一夜，他等在老師歸家必須經過的大路邊，路邊青草很深，把他小小的身軀藏住。前幾天，他貯藏了滿滿一瓶的螢火蟲，此時統統倒了出來，用手掌把它們一搓，然後全塗飾到自己的臉上，於是滿臉都粘着一閃一閃的螢火光，像亮面孔的妖怪。等老師的脚步聲自遠處慢慢走近了，他驀地從草叢中一攅出來，出其不意，竟把可憐的老師嚇倒了，回家去生了一塲大病」。</p>
<p>孩子們先笑了一陣，後來又駡袁世凱眞是個壞傢伙了，大孩子說：「難怪他後來要做皇帝要賣國，原來他在小時候就是一個大壞蛋了」。</p>
<p>「皇帝之中還有一位和螢火蟲發生過趣事的，那便是隋　帝。夏天，他在景華宮裏發下一道命令，徴求幾十斛螢火蟲，於是京城中家家戶都派人到鄕下去捉，捉了好幾天，纔滿了皇帝的慾望。你們知道隋　用這幾十斛流螢幹什麽呢？他帶了所有的飛螢跑，上高山頂，把它們同時放出，於是數萬的小火光漫山遍野飛了起來，天上的星點似乎也沒有這樣的多眞個是好玩極了」！</p>
<p>「甚帝爲什麽也和小孩子一般的玩皮呢？」小女孩子問。</p>
<p>「古代帝王有許多都是大壞蛋，都愛拚命浪費掉老百姓的氣力，以供個人的娛樂，像隋　帝這個玩意兒還算是無甚大害的，至於其他帝王專幹許多有大害於人民的事，一時眞說不盡。袁世凱用流螢　煞老師的故事，當然也是極可惡可恨的。我們所以要反對專制帝王，就在於他們之中有很多是愛幹不合理而殘酷凶狠的事的。」我這樣爲孩子們得着一個說琉螢故事的小結論。</p>
<h3>美退伍士兵的苦惱</h3>
<p>— 公弢</p>
<p>美國一位退伍的士兵寫給印地安那州的代表一封信，內中他說：</p>
<p>「軍隊中規定我回到家中後後便不能再穿制服，否則我當被認爲是「冒充軍人。」而店員們又吿訴我，他們沒有合我尺寸的衣服，警察們說我不能光着身子在街上走，道是違法的。我也很喜歡不出去，但是我又找不到一間房子住，甚至於因爲木料缺乏，我連個木桶也買不到。我曾受過傷，因之體格也不够標準，再想重入伍也不能，這可呌我怎麽辦！？」</p>
<h3>思佳客</h3>
<p>— 胡盧</p>
<p>盜賊起家</p>
<p>不斷奇聞見報章，曾聞强盜蓋洋房；又聞竊賊良田貢，盜賊居然闊老裝！</p>
<p>優腦殺，好心腸，難乎斯世免飢慌！空空妙手知多少，慣把衣冠巧掩藏！</p>
<h3>紅毛國</h3>
<p>— 季明</p>
<p>當　　簡齊子不語及王漁洋，灤陽消夏錄，中俱載紅毛國故事，略謂紅毛國人善航海，且善識寳物。惟秉性陰驚，好殺人越貨，故雖屢請互市，中朝米之許焉。茶年，紅毛國商請於有司，願賜一衣之地以爲盧，有司許之，後開衣展視，方圓竟達數畝，居民允譯，因被飽掠而去云云。余按此處紅毛國，即今之葡萄牙也，先是，明世宗嘉靖十四年，都指揮黄慶因受葡人之賄，請以澳門爲通商地，是爲葡人入澳門互市之始，其後嘉靖三十二年，蔔商以貢品被水，乞地晾晒爲辭，佔地益廣，神宗萬曆元年，澳門官吏復受蔔人賄，於澳門半島狹處築牆爲界，由葡人繳納租金五百，是爲今日葡人統治澳門之起源。袁王二書所載，或係嘉靖三十二年事之誤。二君均以通儒自命，然其對「洋務」之隔膜，於此可見，今澳門屢有收回之說，終以葡人逶迤其辭，未得要領，不識今日之紅毛國人，尙如昔日所載否？</p>
<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>禮讓往來在美國</p>
<p>中國老學究有「禮失而救諸野」的說法，像中國這樣一個五千年文化的古國，大家白白熟讀了「禮記」竟至門生看見老師不招呼，兒子見到老子不鞠躬，反而沒有美國人SirDaddy，Honey呌得震天响那們有禮。中國戲台上所見「小生這廂有禮了」原是對付女性的功夫，沒有人對老師或父親說過。</p>
<p>美國人最重禮節，却並不誇張，他們每逢季節嘉慶生長，一定要分送賀片，這種賀片每張自五分到一元。是一份禮而不能算重禮。中國人送禮不同了，竟有某銀行把黄金鑄成枇粑送端節的，由禮讓而淪爲賄賂，禮記上所說的「禮」早已失掉了，說不定那「禮」已渡重洋到了美國·</p>
<p>中國人送禮的種類很多，有送汽車洋房的，有送美鈔金條的，有送銀行禮券的，也有送艷婢美妾的。美國人送禮包括賀片，巧克力糖，化粧品，首飾，衣着用品之類。男性送給愛人的，句以買奶罩，短袴；女性送給愛人的，可以買睡衣，拖鞋，這種禮物，充其量不過美金數元，已夠是很厚的禮了。女子在大學時父母有送手錶或畢業紀念躦戒的，也有送鋼琴的，那是豪門作風，頗不多　，不過鋼琴在美國，不過三四百元，其代價僅僅金枇杷一只而已。（十）</p>
<p>科學小品</p>
<h3>鳳蝶</h3>
<p>— 賈祖璋</p>
<p>「雙眉卷鐵絲，兩翅暈金碧，初來花爭姸，忽去鬼無迹。」</p>
<p>蘇軾這首鬼蝶詩，所詠的就是古今注所說的「有大如蝙蝠者，或黑色，或靑斑，名爲鳳子，一名鳳車，一名鬼車，生江南柑橘園中。」現在一般動物學書中稱牠為鳳蝶，大概就是從鳳子鳳車這兩個名稱演變而來的。桂海虫魚志稱牠為鬼人云元武蟬。」顯然指的仍舊是鳳蝶。</p>
<p>現在民間說牠是梁山伯祝英臺的化身，流傳着一個凄艷的故事。祝英臺是一個獨養女兒，父母愛她如掌珠，把她作為兒子看待。她穿了男子的服裝，在學堂裏讀書，像木蘭從軍一樣，并沒有被人識破。平時與同學梁山伯感情最好，日久便發生了愛情，梁山伯卻沒有知道。後來祝英臺職學返家，竟然懨懨成病，累得父母爲她多方求醫，一點也沒有效驗？直到病勢危篤的時候，祝英臺才吐出了自己的心事。父母聽了，急忙打發人去通知梁山伯。但是雲山阻隔，路途遼遠，等到梁山伯趕來的時候，祝英臺早已香消玉殞了。梁山伯帶着凄凉疚恨的心緒，走到墳頭去祭弔，墳上突然豁裂開來，把梁山伯掩沒了。祝英臺的父母趕忙僱人挖掘，却不見了他們兩人的屍體，祇飛出來了一對美麗的蝴蝶。從此便時常可以看見他們在花上雙　飛行。這個故事在明代已有記錄，見於山堂肆考，云：「俗傳大蝶必成雙，乃梁山伯祝英　之魂，又競憑夫婦之魂，皆不可曉。」</p>
<p>至於韓憑夫婦的故事，起源比梁山伯夫婦的故事要早，係見於搜神記，云：「宋大夫諭憑娶　美，宋康王奪之，憑自殺。　陰腐其衣，與王登臺，自投臺下，左右攬之，着手化爲難業。」也有說他們化成鴛鴦的（參閱拙著鳥與文學）。化鴛鴦也罷，化蝴蝶也罷，總之是人間深情的象徴。</p>
<p>鳳蝶是一科大形美麗的蝶類，後翅延長成尾狀，大槪翩翩飛行，有如鳳風，所以名爲鳳子。幼虫有多種害食柑橘的葉子，容易在庭國間發見，比較的與人接近，容易引人注意。</p>
<p>但是這樣美麗習見，又有鳳子這類美麗名稱的蝶類，在中國文學上，却很少有人引用到。據文昌雜錄說，祇有韓很的詩裏，曾經用到鳳子的詞兒。那詩是「鵝兒唼　雌黄嘴，鳳子輕盈膩粉腰。」短短七個字，把鳳蝶的性狀活潑生動地都描寫出來了。</p>
<p>至於稱爲鬼蝶，大　是與韓憑或梁山伯夫婦死後化蝶的傳說有關；或者因爲牠的顏色是黑的。</p>

<h3>The State Council Will Decide on Important Matters to Clarify the Situation and Expedite the Suppression of the Rebellion; Mobilizing the Entire Country to Implement Wartime Rituals</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] The central government has decided to strengthen the military suppression of the communists, clarify the current situation. An important proposal will be presented at the sixth State Council meeting at 9:00 AM on the 4th, which will be personally presided over by Chairman Chiang, to demonstrate to the country, concentrate forces, and achieve complete success. This proposal has been drafted after days of consultation and study by various parties. At 6:00 PM on the 3rd, Chairman Chiang summoned the presidents of the five Yuan, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Bulei, Chen Lifu, Shao Lizi, Bai Chongxi, Chen Cheng, and five others to his official residence for final discussions on the contents of the proposal, which lasted until 7:30 PM. It is reported that the proposal stipulates a national mobilization to concentrate forces and implement a wartime system in order to end the rebellion as soon as possible. Once the State Council approves it, it will be formally announced. The implementation methods will be drafted by the relevant departments in charge. For example, the collection of military grain will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Food, and conscription will be the responsibility of the Ministry of National Defense. This proposal is actually similar to a general mobilization order. Sun Ke hosted a banquet for responsible persons from the Min and Qing parties on the evening of the 3rd, during which Wu Dingchang took out the original text of the proposal for them to review, and they had no objection to it. According to a responsible person from the government, the government's attitude towards suppressing the rebellion has already been seen in the clear order issued on the 2nd to commend the defending troops in the Siping campaign. It seems that there is no need to issue a proclamation at this time.</p>
<p>The Three Parties' Nomination and Election Method Will be Discussed by a Small Group</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] The Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters held a grand meeting at 8:00 PM on the 3rd, where Sun Ke hosted a banquet for important figures from the Min and Qing parties to discuss election issues. Those present included Hu Haimen, Ji Yiqiao, Jiang Yuntian, Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, Wang Shixian, and others from the Min and Qing parties, as well as Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Zhang Lisheng, Bu Lizi, and 21 others from the government. During the meeting, members of the Min and Qing parties proposed a method for the three parties to jointly nominate candidates. Some expressed opposition, but after discussion, it was decided that each of the three parties would nominate three people to form a nine-person small group to discuss the nomination method and procedures. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] Yu Jiaju, a government official from the Youth Party, told reporters on the 3rd that the necessary conditions for clarifying local politics should be the separation of military and civil administration and military-civilian cooperation. The former means that the limits of military and political power should also be clearly defined in the war zone, the prestige of administrative officials should be enhanced, and military personnel should not interfere in administration, so that politics will naturally be clear and progress gradually. The latter means that military personnel should strengthen training and be sure to cherish the people, so as to achieve military-civilian cooperation. Yu said that the Communist Party has two characteristics: one is to find ways to weaken national strength in various aspects, and the other is absolute exclusiveness, so it is extremely difficult to cooperate with them. When asked by reporters about the State Council meeting on the 4th, which would present a proposal expressing its attitude towards the Communist Party, what were the Youth Party's opinions? Yu believed that it should include the following points: (1) The attitude of being forced to fight, stating that it is impossible to achieve cooperation with the Communist Party through peaceful means, and it is not that the government is unwilling to seek a solution through political means, but that it is impossible to obtain a solution through political means. (2) In non-war zones, full attention should be paid to clarifying local politics and strengthening economic construction so that people's lives can be stabilized. (3) The general public is afraid of the state of war, so it should be explained that efforts should be made to avoid increasing the people's pain and burden, and conscription and grain collection should be avoided as much as possible. Yu believed that it was necessary for the government to formally express its attitude and inform the people to boost military morale, but there was no need to issue an order to attack.</p>
<h3>Loyal and Courageous Struggle to Ensure the Famous City; The Chairman Sends a Telegram to Encourage All Officers and Soldiers; Chen Mingren Grows a Beard to Commemorate the Siping Campaign</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd] This time in the battle of Siping, thanks to the loyalty, courage, determination, and hard struggle of our officers and soldiers, we were able to repel the stubborn enemy and ensure the famous city, adding a glorious page to the history of the revolution. Chairman Chiang sent a telegram to encourage all officers and soldiers: Director Xiong, Commander Du, forwarding to Army Commander Chen of Siping Street, Chairman Liu, and forwarding to Deputy Army Commanders Chen and Chen, Chief of Staff Ma, Director Wu of the Political Department, Division Commanders Xiong, Peng, Zhao, and Song, each Deputy Division Commander, Chief of Staff, each Division Political Department Director, each Regiment, Battalion, Company, Platoon Leader, and all combat officers and soldiers: All comrades, risking your lives, for the Party and the country, for the cause, fought bravely and fiercely for eighteen days and nights, carrying forward the spirit of the Whampoa Revolution, sparing no sacrifice to the end, defending the territory, vowing to coexist and die together, your loyal hearts and blood can move even ghosts and gods, and have won God's blessing, finally enabling our Siping to turn from danger to safety. The spirits of our Founder, martyrs, and fallen soldiers are also comforted. I was overjoyed to hear the news of the relief. I do not know the actual number of our officers and soldiers killed and wounded. I hope you will quickly investigate and report so that we can provide condolences, and thoroughly investigate and report the meritorious officers and soldiers of each unit so that we can quickly issue awards and commendations for their special achievements. I also hope that you will report in detail the losses and casualties of the local people.</p>
<p>[United Press, Siping Street, 3rd] Army Commander Chen Mingren, a native of Hunan, is 48 years old, strong, gentle, and has a beautiful beard. On the 3rd, he solemnly told reporters: "In the past 20 days, I have not had time to shave, so I have grown this. Now I will permanently keep it as a souvenir of the Siping Street campaign." The 71st Army was the first national army to receive American equipment based on the Lend-Lease Act. Of the nine battalions under the 87th Division, only four remain. The southeast of the city is now defended by the 54th Division, the northwest is defended by the 87th Division, and the northeast is defended by the 88th Division. In addition, there is a security team of 1,000 people.</p>
<h3>Zhao Jiaxiang Predicts: The Situation in Northeast China</h3>
<p>Will Turn into an International Conflict</p>
<p>[United Press, Shenyang, 3rd] Zhao Jiaxiang, Chief of Staff of the Northeast Security Command, told a United Press reporter on the 3rd that the struggle in Northeast China is a Soviet attempt to seize the area under the guise of a Chinese civil war. He predicted that within a year, this would turn into an international conflict. He attacked Soviet officers for commanding the Communist army in the battle of Siping. He said that the vast Shenyang Arsenal, which was moved by the Soviet Union, was not moved to the Soviet Union, but rebuilt in the Northeast, near the Sino-Soviet border, to manufacture weapons for the CCP. Other machines taken by the Soviet Union in Dalian were handed over to the CCP to manufacture mines and hand grenades. Zhao compared the current struggle in the Northeast to Japan's previous occupation of the area. He said: "The new Japanese" are smarter than the old Japanese because the old Japanese failed to conceal their imperialist ambitions. "However, bear paws are a delicacy in the Northeast. If they do not retreat, we will eat them."</p>
<p>Zhao said that the National Army will spare no sacrifice to defend the Northeast, and pointed out that three years after the Sino-Japanese War, other countries also began to be involved in the vortex of war. "The same situation will happen this time."</p>
<p>He attacked Lieutenant General Saito, former Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, who is now a military adviser to Lin Biao, commander of the Communist Northeast Army. He said that this information, as well as information that Soviet officers assisted the Communist army in the battle of Siping, was learned by General Chen Mingren, the National Army commander who defended Siping Street, from captured Communist soldiers. Zhao also said that the battle of Siping Street was a "turning point" in the current campaign, and claimed that the Communist Party suffered 25,000 deaths and 25,000 injuries in this battle, while the National Army's losses were only 4,000 deaths and 11,000 injuries. He admitted that the National Army was facing severe pressure in the Northeast, but was determined to hold its current positions. Zhao declared: "Now the National Army is winning in both offense and defense." When the reporter suggested that he might be overemphasizing the Soviet Union's role in the Northeast conflict, because most of the Communist army was made up of Chinese who had been fighting the Kuomintang for many years, Zhao replied: "In the past, there were also many Chinese who fought on the side of the Japanese."</p>
<h3>The National Army Changes Strategy to Capture the Main Force of the Communist Army</h3>
<p>[Our Changchun Office, 3rd] According to military observers here, the National Army has decided to change its strategy and take the initiative from now on. Depending on the progress, it will go beyond the recovered areas and capture the main force of the Communist army in order to annihilate them and seek long-term stability. Although the Communist army suffered a major blow in the Siping campaign, its remnants are still lurking and fleeing around Jilin and Changchun, as well as along the Pingmei and Jihai lines, breaking up into smaller units to maneuver with the National Army. Therefore, the Northeast war has changed from large-scale battles to hunting down the dispersed forces of the Communist army. The Communist army's defeat this time is different from the past in that they did not flee north across the river in panic. We are very optimistic about the future of the war, but we must not be negligent due to optimism. The Communist army's continuous supply of ammunition during this major battle makes us realize the need to be vigilant.</p>

<p>[Our Beiping Office, 3rd] He Siyuan, the mayor of Beiping, gave a special analysis of the current situation in Shandong at a press conference on the 3rd, based on his many years of experience in guerrilla warfare in Shandong. He said that the National Army has completely controlled the favorable conditions in Shandong. The base areas cultivated by the Communist army in the Yimeng Mountains in central Shandong for many years have been occupied by the National Army in Nanma, Lucun, Yuezhuang, and Donglidian, and the Communist army has had to withdraw from central Shandong.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Office, 3rd] After the center of gravity of the war in central Shandong shifted to the central section of the Jiaoji Railway, the war situation in Shandong has entered a new stage. After the National Army in the central Shandong mountainous area recovered Donglidian and Yuezhuang, the nerve center of the Communist East China Military Region, on the 2nd, it continued to march towards Linqu by moonlight. The National Army under Wang Yaowu, which went south from Weixian and Changle, entered Linqu at noon on the 3rd. The Communist army fled northwestward. At 7:00 PM, the vanguard of the National Army, which went north from Yuezhuang, had joined forces with Wang Yaowu's troops.

More than 300 Communist soldiers surrendered voluntarily south of Nanma on the 2nd.</p>
<p>[Our Linyi Office, 3rd] The bloody battles in Yuezhuang, Shiqiao, and Donglidian in the Yishan Mountains are becoming increasingly fierce. The two armies entered and exited Donglidian no less than 30 times, and Yuezhuang more than 10 times. The Communist army set up defenses all over the mountains and buried mines everywhere. All mountains and villages must be resisted to the death. In order to eliminate its main force, the Feng Army adopted a steady encirclement and attack strategy. As of noon on the 3rd, the fighting was still fierce. In order to take the initiative, in addition to leaving four columns on the front of the mountainous area to resist gradually, the Communist army also sneaked two columns to Tianmashan in the southeast of Mengyin, attempting to disturb the rear of the National Army. After being encircled and attacked by the National Army, one of the columns broke through and sneaked to the vicinity of Mengyin on the 2nd. Its 7th Column and the original 5th and 6th Columns, based in Yi and Ju, also sneaked around the outskirts of Linyi and are being attacked by the National Army in separate directions.</p>

Fortunately, the pilots Liao Canmin and Shi Jiecun immediately turned back and calmly responded in this critical moment, and were able to land at the Xi'an Airport. However, the damaged engine caught fire and burned itself. The fire trucks had already arrived in time because they saw smoke coming from the plane from afar and immediately put out the fire. The passengers were able to get off the plane safely and avoid a calamity.</p>
<h3>Repair and Defense Work Cannot Proceed; The Yellow River is in Danger of Breaching; The Communist Army in Hebei is Also Harassing the River Construction Area</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] The Communist army is destroying the agreement and hindering the restoration of the Yellow River dike. Liu Bocheng's troops are crossing the river on a large scale, causing the river construction to be unable to proceed, and there is a danger of a serious breach at any time. The reporter visited Xue Dubi, Minister of Water Resources, on the 3rd. According to him, "After the repair and defense agreement was signed, the government solemnly sent personnel to Bian to negotiate a ceasefire agreement with the Communist Party. Who knew that Ye Nanfu, the representative of the Ministry of National Defense, had just arrived in Bian, and the Communist army had already crossed the river south, with no credibility at all. The dike problem is now extremely serious. The Ministry of Water Resources is doing its best to carry out the project. As long as the Communist army does not come, we will use one minute to engage in the project. However, the current situation is obviously beyond the capacity of the Ministry of Water Resources and requires the cooperation of military defense and river defense." Xue has repeatedly consulted with Bai Chongxi, Minister of National Defense, and other people in recent days, asking them to quickly clear the Communist army on the south bank of the Yellow River. On the 3rd, he also wrote to Minister Bai and Chief of Staff Chen to reiterate his intentions. It is reported that the Ministry of National Defense indicated that it could transfer reinforcements to go there.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] Following the harassment and obstruction of the Yellow River restoration project by the Communist army in Dongkou, the Communist army in Hebei is also harassing the river construction area. Liuzhuang and Gao Village on the Yellow River dike in Hebei have always been dangerous sections. The Hebei Repair and Defense Office has been rushing to repair them day and night in order to get through the difficult period of the flood season. Unexpectedly, at 10:00 PM on the 1st, the Communist army suddenly invaded and occupied them. The Hebei Repair and Defense Office immediately took emergency measures, ordering the Liu Zhuang flood fighting and dike restoration team to temporarily guard Shang Village, and ordering Wang Ziqian, the leader of the Third Engineering Team, to lead 50 team members, together with flood soldiers, to protect it at risk. The other engineering teams 1, 2, and 5 were temporarily transferred to work at Mao Dian.</p>
<p>[Our Yanzhou Office, 3rd] The Liu Bocheng's troops, who secretly crossed the Yellow River from western Shandong, had increased to 30,000 people by the 2nd, sneaking from Dongkou Linpuji towards Yuncheng and Heze. By noon on the 3rd, they had been blocked by the National Army on the line of Shifanzhuang west of Yuncheng and Luzhuang Fantun northwest of Heze. In addition, the local Communist army team of 5,000 people, which had originally sneaked into the Yejun northwest of Dongping, also sneaked between Wenshang and Yuncheng. An observer said that this battle in western Shandong would not affect the war in the Yimeng Mountains. A new force of the National Army has arrived and it will not be difficult to quell it.</p>

<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 2nd] Secretary of State Marshall held a press conference on the 2nd. When reporters asked about the recent sale of arms to China, Secretary Marshall replied that the lifting of the restrictions on transportation costs to China did not mean that the United States intended to support the Chinese government in its civil war.

<h3>Heavy Losses After the Plunder of Sipingjie and Gongzhuling; Liu Handong Appeals for Relief for the Survivors</h3>
<p>[Report from our Beiping Office, 3rd] Due to the war, the loss of soybeans transported from the Northeast is estimated to be over several billions. The area between Shenyang and Changchun along the Middle East Railway is a major soybean-producing region. After the victory, the China Trust Bureau, various financial institutions, businesses, and grain merchants flocked to the area to purchase soybeans at various stations along the Middle East Railway for export to earn foreign exchange, or to sell them within the country for profit. Before the war clouds loomed over the Northeast, the soybeans transported from Gongzhuling, Sipingjie, Changtu, and Kaiyuan were piled up like mountains. However, after the war spread, some were burned and some were lost. The estimated loss is over ten billion yuan. It is said that a certain commercial institution in Beiping invested all the profits it had made after the victory in purchasing soybeans in the Northeast. This war has caused it significant losses.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] According to an investigation by relevant authorities, Gongzhuling suffered severe losses during the forty days it was occupied and then retreated from by the Communist army. Statistical reports include the coal, horses, and food that were taken away, as well as the factories, school buildings, and transportation and communication equipment that were destroyed. The estimated loss is over ten billion yuan at current prices.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Siping, 3rd] After the news that the National Government had issued a clear order to commend the military and civilians who defended Siping reached here, all the military and civilians in the city were greatly excited, forgetting the fatigue of the 20-day and night bloody battle, and their spirits were lifted. Director Xiong, Commander Du, and the Liaoning Troop慰勞団 have allocated a total of 70 million yuan in circulating currency. In addition, a large number of cigarettes and canned goods were brought by plane and distributed to the military and civilians defending the city to express their condolences. Siping is currently without water and electricity, becoming a dry, parched, black, tattered, and filthy city. Decaying corpses have not yet been buried, and the stench is overflowing, raising concerns about epidemics. The Northeast Headquarters has dispatched a health team to carry out disinfection and vaccination work. Chairman Liu Handong told reporters on the 3rd: This province has been completely lost, and no county or city has been spared. The whereabouts of the county magistrates of Changtu and Xi’an are still unknown. The reconstruction of various levels of government, the restoration of education and culture, the care of refugees, the revitalization of economic construction, and the prevention and control of famine and epidemics require human, material, and financial resources that are beyond the capacity of this province after such a catastrophe. It is hoped that people across the country will be concerned about the disaster victims and work together to provide assistance so that the four million survivors of Liaobei Province will no longer suffer from the threat of famine and epidemics.</p>

The purpose of this团 is to convey the Central Government's intentions and慰勞 the military and civilians. The Northeast is geographically important to our future. Our government fought for the Northeast, and the Second World War also started from there. The security of the Northeast affects the world, so defending the security of the Northeast is also defending the security of the world. He expressed his deep joy at the victory of Siping. He also stated: Those who use foreign aid to create chaos will ultimately fail. He finally encouraged all the military and civilians to unite sincerely and continue to struggle so that order in the Northeast could be restored as soon as possible. Deputy团长钱公来 also delivered a speech. Military and civilian representatives Dong Yanping, Zhao Jiaxiang, and Shenyang City Councilor Zhang Baozi delivered speeches in response, hoping that the spirit of military-civilian cooperation would create an iron Shenyang. He also pointed out that the Siping campaign was of great importance to the war situation in the Northeast, and hoped that the victory would be expanded in the future to recover the entire Northeast. Zhao emphasized the need to recognize the current significance of the war, which is to "overthrow the running dogs of imperialism." He then said: In celebrating the victory of Siping, we should continue to promote the revolutionary spirit, eliminate the rebellion, and recover the Northeast. He also suggested that we observe a minute of silence for the military and civilians who died in Siping.

<h3>Linked Import and Export Measures; National Economic Commission Continued Review Yesterday; Decision to Reduce Overly Large Institutions</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 3rd] The National Economic Commission continued to hold a plenary review meeting in the afternoon of the 3rd to discuss economic reform plans. After four hours of discussion, careful studies and revisions were made to the various aspects of the plan related to agriculture, industry, commerce, finance, food, and transportation. It was also decided that Xiao Zheng would be the convener of the review and organization of the "Finance and Guiding Idle Funds" section, and Xu Baiyuan would be the convener of the review and organization of the finance section. Today's meeting was chaired by Xu Kan, and more than 20 people attended, including Weng Wenhao, Zhang Jia'ao, Yu Hongjun, and Chen Qitian. First, Yu Hongjun, Zhang Jia'ao, and Tan Boyu each gave a work report, and then the discussion began. The most important of these was the linked import and export licensing method. Many of the committee members disagreed with this method, believing that it would easily lead to abuses if implemented suddenly at the present time. For example, some imported goods are subject to U.S. export restrictions, while goods that the U.S. can export are often restricted from import by us. Since we do not fully adopt liberalism for imports and exports, it is naturally difficult to implement linking. Furthermore, foreign exchange settlement is also a difficult point. If the job is not completely taken as a solution, then foreign exchange settlement is necessary. If it is based on the official price, it will definitely not be what the merchants want. If it is based on the black market price, the government will have difficulty accepting it. It was decided that the Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Affairs would draft a method and then decide.</p>
<p>When discussing industrial policy, Weng Wenhao disagreed with the original plan's proposal that "industrial construction should be located as much as possible in places where fuel and raw materials are cheap," believing that this method could not meet future construction needs and should be revised. Jian Guan'san suggested that the country be divided into several major industrial zones based on national defense and people's livelihood needs and resource distribution, and this opinion should be included in the plan. Other committee members made many suggestions for revision and debate, so it was decided that Weng Wenhao would convene Chen Qitian, Pan Xulun, Deng Feihuang, and others to review and revise the plan with reference to the first phase of economic principles and the opinions expressed by the committee members. Regarding the collection of public and private banks to form a Reconstruction Finance Corporation to invest in long-term industrial and mining construction, and to use overseas Chinese funds and foreign exchange funds deposited abroad to invest in the company to purchase machinery and raw materials from abroad, there was a fierce debate on both sides. As a result, it was decided that those whose purpose is to invest in industrial and mining construction projects could be established. At the meeting, it was also discussed which railways were main lines and which were branch lines. The main lines would be operated by the central government with all its strength, and branch lines would be permitted under the central government's management system, and local and private operations would be encouraged.</p>
<p>After Tan Boyu explained, the meeting passed the proposal according to the Ministry of Communications' opinion. Regarding the simplification of tax collection, Liu Zhendong and others believed that merchants often used this as an excuse to make demands in order to achieve the purpose of delaying or reducing payments, and it was decided to delete the item of simplifying tax collection.</p>
<p>The general budget group and the financial group of the committee passed the following major cases at a joint meeting on the morning of the 3rd: (1) In order to save national expenditures, overly large institutions should be reduced and downsized. (2) The treatment of employees of state-owned and public-owned enterprises and banks should be consistent with that of public, educational, and military personnel in general, in order to be fair, and to study ways to improve the treatment of public, educational, and military personnel in order to achieve uniformity.</p>

<h3>An Important Page in Constitutional History; Increase in the Number of Reporter Legislators; Legislative Yuan Resolves to Increase from Two to Five</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 5th] The Legislative Yuan held its 331st regular meeting on the morning of the 3rd, with President Sun兼 presiding. More than 80 legislators attended and passed the following major cases: (1) Revised Regulations on Domestic Tobacco and Alcohol Tax. (2) Revised Article 51, Paragraph 3 of the Distant Police Penalty Law. (3) Smuggling Punishment Ordinance. (4) Revised Article 25 and Article 32 of the War Criminals Trial Ordinance. (5) Revised Article 4 of the China Farmers Bank Land Bond Law (the face value of land bonds is divided into three types: 50,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan). (6) The Criminal Law Committee reported on the review of whether the term of the Regulations on Criminal Cases of U.S. Military Personnel in China could be extended until the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops. It was decided to pass the review as per the constitutional opinion (revised Article 7 of the Regulations on Handling Criminal Cases of U.S. Military Personnel in China. This regulation will be implemented from the date of promulgation, and its validity period will be until the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops). (7) Revised Article 17 and Article 18 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Opium and Drug Prohibition, and revised Article 3 of the Regulations on Special Criminal Case Proceedings. (8) Distribution Table of Legislative Yuan Members Elected by Occupational Groups. (9) Committee member Zhao Pei and others requested that the number of Legislative Yuan members from Tibet be increased by two and allocated to the Tibetan ethnic group in Qinghai. (10) Distribution Table of National Assembly Women Representatives. It was decided to return to the review and determine the principle that in the 168 places for women's group representatives in the National Assembly, the basic number for each province and city should account for two places, and the representatives of national women's groups should account for 20 places. The remainder will be allocated to provinces and cities based on population. In addition, five budget proposals were passed. The meeting started at 9:30 a.m. and adjourned at 12:30 p.m., and it was scheduled to reconvene at 4:00 p.m. on the 4th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 3rd] Regarding the issue of the number of reporter representatives from the Legislative Yuan, which concerns reporter participation in politics, when it was raised at the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 3rd, Lai Chenxun argued on the basis of reason, and Chen Haicheng and Zhong Tianxin spoke out righteously, with the support of President Sun. It was decided that, according to the temporary motion proposed by Chen Xunxin, the number of representatives of free professions would be increased from the original 10 to 15, and the number of reporter representatives would also be increased from the originally allocated two to five. This matter is of great significance to the press in the future, as it will use its detached position to promote democracy and advocate constitutionalism. It not only establishes a new milestone in the history of journalism, but also an important page in constitutional history.</p>
<h3>Journalists Have Great Responsibility at the Beginning of Constitutional Governance</h3>
<p>This case was proposed based on the "Distribution Table of the Number of Occupational Representatives in the Legislative Yuan". After Liu Ke, Chairman of the Constitution and Legal Affairs Committee, reported on the review process, Situ De and Liu Youchen spoke successively, pointing out valuable opinions on the distribution of the number of industrial and commercial groups in the distribution table of occupational representatives in the Legislative Yuan. Chen Xun念 then spoke. Chen had proposed a temporary motion today co-signed by 22 legislators, suggesting increasing the number of representatives of free professions and increasing the proportion of reporter representatives to 6%, from two to five.</p>
<p>When Chen explained this proposal, he said: According to the review committee's distribution of 84 occupational representatives, the 10 representatives of free professions only account for 11.9% of the total, which seems too few. And these 10 places must be further distributed by five units: journalists, lawyers, accountants, technicians, and medical groups. The Department of Social Affairs will determine the detailed allocation in the future. However, the department's figures are based on statistics before April, which show that there are only 3,000 members of press groups. In fact, Zhejiang, Beijing, Shanghai, and other places are not included. According to our estimates, the total number of press group members nationwide should be more than 30,000. The number of 3,000 is not accurate. According to this distribution, the proportion of Legislative Yuan members is inaccurate. Chen also pointed out that according to previous regulations, educational groups originally belonged to the category of free professions. Now, they have been specially singled out. This is a measure to respect education, and the intention is very good. However, after this change, the number of educational groups has increased sharply from 6% of the original total to 20%, an increase of nearly three times, which should be reconsidered. Chen said in an impassioned tone: During the Anti-Japanese War, journalists followed the government and moved to the rear. They made great contributions by engaging in reporting amidst gunfire. At the beginning of this constitutional governance, we need journalists who know the hardships of the people to fulfill their responsibility to promote democracy and advocate constitutionalism. At present, free professions only have 10 members of the Legislative Yuan, and reporters account for at most two. Considering the number of reporters nationwide and their responsibilities, it seems too few. Therefore, I propose a temporary motion to increase the number of reporter groups to 6% and clearly stipulate this in the item of free professional groups. As for the total number of free professional groups, please increase it from 11.9% to 18%.</p>
<h3>President and Legislators Speak in Support of Journalists</h3>
<p>After Chen finished speaking, Chen Ruxuan and others rose to speak, expressing their agreement with his suggestion. Chen Ruxuan believes that free professions are important, and the number of representatives should be increased. He also pointed out that it is unfair to use the number of people as the allocation standard. However, it is also unfair to use units as the standard. The best way is to determine the number of places based on the current contribution of the group to the country and society and the needs of the future. Our country is founded on agriculture and built on industry. Agricultural and industrial groups should have more places. Free professions only have 10 representatives, and they must be distributed among five units: lawyers, accountants, technicians, journalists, and medical groups, so the number should be appropriately increased.</p>
<p>Chen Haicheng also took the same view, pointing out that representatives of various industries are often limited to the interests of their own industries, and often only seek development for themselves. Journalists also have their concerns, but what they are concerned about is only how freedom of speech is not restricted, and they have no other vested interests. Those who are elected must be experienced people, and they will be able to take care of all corners with their objective, calm, and fair minds. Reporters are familiar with the interests of all classes, and they can play a coordinating role in the Legislative Yuan in the future. The current regulations only stipulate that journalists elect two representatives, which should be considered. Chen Zhangsheng suggested that the increased number of places for journalists should be drawn from the 20% of educational groups. The Legislative Yuan holds meetings for eight months a year, and there are various review committees. If educational representatives take care of their positions, they will inevitably fail to attend meetings, and it is difficult to take care of both. The number of educational representatives should be increased, but the increase should not be so large, and a part of the total proportion they occupy should be given to the journalists.</p>
<p>President Sun兼 rose to speak, also believing that free professional groups have the most sound organization and the least number of places, which is worth considering. He also pointed out that among the professional groups nationwide, the organization of farmers' associations is the worst, but they have the most places, accounting for 24 out of 84. In the future, they will inevitably be manipulated by non-genuine farmers and should be reduced.</p>
<p>Zhong Tianxin, a "friend of journalists", spoke, believing that the original intention of increasing the number of educational groups was only to express respect for education. However, the so-called education cannot be limited to schools. If its scope is expanded, newspapers should also be respected. The influence of today's newspapers on society is definitely not less than that of schools. Therefore, if the number of places is increased to respect education, the number of free professions and journalists should not only be increased, but the educational groups should be limited to a maximum of 12 places, and the remaining five places should be allocated to free professions. The number of places for journalists should be increased by three, from the original two to five.</p>
<h3>I Will Reiterate the Ban on Foreign Aircraft Intrusion</h3>
<p>Navigation Restriction Regulations Are Being Drafted</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 3rd] In order to protect the sovereignty of its airspace, the government will reiterate the ban on foreign aircraft arbitrarily intruding into our country's airspace. The Navigation Restriction Regulations are being presided over by Fei Zhenqiu, Vice Minister of the Ministry of National Defense, together with the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and relevant units, to determine the principles, and the draft can be completed in the short term.</p>
<h3>Decision on the Allocation of the Number of Occupational Group Legislators</h3>
<p>After discussing for more than an hour, Chuantong Xian, Situ De and others suggested first deciding on some principles. Chen Guyuan also assumed an allocation ratio, namely 18 for agricultural groups, 18 for industrial groups, 3 for fishing groups, 16 for industrial and commercial groups, 13 for education, and 16 for free professions.</p>
<p>At this point, President Sun兼 rose to speak again, pointing out that according to our country's traditional concept, scholars, farmers, workers, and merchants have always been equally important. When we discuss the allocation of the number of occupational representatives of the Legislative Yuan today, we should not base it on population or region, but on its importance to the country and society. A basic allocation can now be made to divide the various occupations into five major groups: agriculture, industry, commerce, education, and free professions. Each group will receive 15 places, totaling 75 places, plus 3 places for the fishing industry, totaling 78 places. Only 6 places remain unallocated and can be divided into agricultural and industrial groups. Chen Guyuan advocated that each of the industrial and agricultural groups increase by three places.</p>
<p>The meeting voted on this opinion, and it was passed by a majority, with 18 for agriculture, 18 for industry, 3 for fishing, 5 for commerce, 10 for industry and mining, 15 for education, and 15 for free professions. The number of women who should occupy among these 84 places was then discussed. According to the original proposal, there were only eight female representatives. After Fu Yan's efforts, it was decided to increase it to ten. However, there were different views on how to allocate it at the meeting. Chuan Yan believed that there should be female representatives for accountants, lawyers, and journalists. However, other committee members believed that they should be added to educational groups. Finally, it was decided that there would be two female representatives from agricultural groups, three from industrial groups, three from education, and two from free professions (one lawyer and one doctor), for a total of ten.</p>
<p>Finally, the distribution table of the number of free professions was discussed. All agreed that the list of original proposals made by Chen Xunlian was fair and passed the proposal without objection, namely five journalists, four medical groups (one woman), three lawyers (one woman), two technicians, and one accountant, for a total of 15.</p>
<p>When this case was discussed today, more than 30 committee members spoke, and almost all supported this request from journalists. After the meeting adjourned, the committee members congratulated the reporters in the audience.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] It is reported that the press has decided to compete in occupational groups, including Cheng Cangbo, President of the Xinwen Bao, Chen Bosheng, Editor-in-Chief of the Central News Agency, Chen Xunxi, Editor-in-Chief of the Shen Bao, Huang Shaogu, President of the Heping Daily, and Hu Jianzhong, President of the Southeast Daily.</p>
<h3>Five More Legislative Yuan Members from Tibet</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The Legislative Yuan discussed the case proposed by committee member Zhao Pei and others to increase the number of Legislative Yuan members from Tibet by two and allocate them to the Tibetan ethnic group in Qinghai on the 3rd. It was decided to pass the review opinion and increase the number of Legislative Yuan members from Tibet by two. The Distribution Table of the Number of Legislative Yuan Members from Tibet and Article 4, Paragraph 3 of the Legislative Yuan Member Election and Recall Law were amended together. The following is recorded: (A) Amended Article 4 of the Legislative Yuan Member Election and Recall Law, the number of Legislative Yuan members is as follows: (1) From each province and directly administered municipality, those with a population of 3 million or less, 5 places, those with a population of more than 3 million, one additional member for every 1 million people. (2) Those elected by the leagues and banners of Mongolia, a total of 22 places. (3) Those elected by Tibet, a total of 15 places. (4) Those elected by various ethnic groups in the border areas, a total of 6 places. (5) Those elected by nationals residing abroad, a total of 19 places. (6) Those elected by occupational groups, a total of 84 places. The allocation of the number of places in each of the preceding paragraphs shall be determined separately by law. (B) Distribution Table of the Number of Legislative Yuan Members from Tibet: (1) 5 places in the Xicang area, including one woman. (2) 5 places for Tibetans temporarily residing in the interior. (3) 5 places for Tibetan people in the province, 2 elected in Qinghai, 2 elected in Xikang, and 1 elected in Gansu.</p>
<h3>Discussion on the Allocation of the Number of Women Representatives in the National Assembly; An Interesting Debate Between Male and Female Legislators</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 3rd] When the Legislative Yuan discussed the Distribution Table of the Number of Women Representatives in the National Assembly on the afternoon of the 3rd, an interesting debate occurred between male and female legislators. Although President Sun 兼's wife and female representatives such as Bao Deming and Tang Guogang attended to cheer them on, the meeting was always dominated by a one-sided atmosphere. The legislators attacked the so-called "national women's groups" to their heart's content. What was most disappointing for the women's world was that, according to the review committee's regulations, national women's groups could elect 33 representatives. The women's world believed that this was too few and requested an increase to 40 places. Unexpectedly, the result was reduced to 20 places. When this case was put to a vote, all of the more than 80 legislators, except for the five women, raised their hands, and then there was a burst of laughter. Bao Deming shouted from the audience: "Today is your men's world," her frustrated look was evident in her words, but she was unable to reverse the decline. The meeting decided that the number of women's group representatives should be based on a basic number of two, and then increased according to the population. The detailed distribution will be studied by the Constitution and Legal Affairs Committee and then submitted to the General Assembly.</p>

<h3>Amendments to the National Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Regulations Passed by the Legislative Yuan at the Regular Meeting on July 3rd</h3>
<p>Article 1: All domestically produced tobacco and alcohol products shall be subject to tobacco and alcohol taxes in accordance with these regulations, unless otherwise stipulated by the commodity tax.</p>
<p>Article 2: The tobacco and alcohol tax is a national tax, levied by the commodity tax authorities under the Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Article 3: The tobacco and alcohol tax rates are stipulated as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Tobacco tax is divided into tobacco leaf and tobacco shreds. The tobacco leaf tax is levied at 50% of the assessed duty-paid price based on the production area, and the tobacco shred tax is levied at 30%.</p>
<p>(2) The alcohol tax is levied at 80% of the assessed duty-paid price based on the production area.</p>
<p>Tobacco leaves used for shredding in the preceding paragraph shall still be subject to tobacco leaf tax first.</p>
<p>Article 4: The duty-paid price of domestically produced tobacco and alcohol products shall be based on the average wholesale price in the market near the place of production within the past three months. However, if the actual wholesale price in the market exceeds or falls below 25% of the average wholesale price on which the duty-paid price is based, the Ministry of Finance may make appropriate adjustments at any time.</p>
<p>The average wholesale price in the preceding paragraph includes (A) the duty-paid price, (B) the original tax paid, i.e., the tax rate applicable to the duty-paid price of that category, and (C) the expenses required to transport from the place of production to the nearby market, set at 15% of the duty-paid price. The calculation formula for the duty-paid price is as follows:</p>
<p>Average wholesale price in the market near the place of production x 100 ÷ (100 + Tobacco and alcohol tax rate + Expenses required from the place of production to the nearby market, i.e., 15). For goods subject to domestic tobacco and alcohol taxes, in order to facilitate tax collection, the Ministry of Finance may adopt a classified and graded levy based on circumstances.</p>
<p>Article 5: The investigation of tobacco and alcohol sales prices, the compilation of price indices, and the assessment and revision of duty-paid prices shall be handled by the Evaluation Committee of the Tax Administration.</p>
<p>Article 6: Tobacco and alcohol products that have been subject to tobacco and alcohol taxes shall not be subject to any additional donations or taxes by local governments when sold domestically.</p>
<p>Article 7: The collection of tobacco and alcohol taxes shall be divided into the following three types, depending on the production situation:</p>
<p>(1) Large-scale production plants or concentrated production areas shall be subject to on-site collection by personnel dispatched by the relevant commodity tax sub-bureaus stationed in the plant or on the premises.</p>
<p>(2) For those where it is inconvenient to dispatch personnel to be stationed in the plant or on the premises, for tobacco shreds and alcohol, the relevant commodity tax sub-bureau shall verify the production volume and collect taxes on a monthly basis. For tobacco leaves, merchants shall report to the commodity tax authorities in the place of production and collect taxes in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>(3) Alcohol produced regularly in winter may be collected in installments depending on the production volume.</p>
<p>The standards for on-site collection in the preceding paragraph and the installments for collection of alcohol produced in winter shall be approved by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Article 8: The tobacco and alcohol tax shall use the duty-paid certificate issued by the Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance as proof of tax payment, and the seal shall be affixed to the package or container seal. However, for retail sales of tobacco shreds and loose retail sales of alcohol where it is not possible to affix the seal, only a duty-paid certificate shall be issued.</p>
<p>Article 9: All merchants and brokers engaged in tobacco and alcohol shall report to the local tax collection authorities, who shall forward the application to the commodity tax authorities for approval and registration, and the bureau shall report to the Tax Administration for record.</p>

<p>(6) Passing off high-priced tobacco and alcohol as low-priced tobacco and alcohol.</p>
<p>(7) Removing tobacco stems from tobacco leaves without reporting, or adding tobacco stems to tobacco leaves.</p>
<p>(8) Altering or reusing duty-paid certificates, sub-transport permits, alteration certificates, or modification certificates.</p>
<p>(9) Failing to properly affix the seal or alteration certificate or modification certificate to the package or container.</p>
<p>(10) Forging duty-paid certificates, sub-transport permits, seals, alteration certificates, modification certificates, or official seals, and using them.</p>
<p>If the evaded tax goods in the preceding paragraph have been sold and cannot be confiscated, in addition to being punished according to law and recovering the price of the goods, the tax shall still be ordered to be supplemented.</p>
<p>Article 11: Tobacco and alcohol merchants and goods holders who commit any of the following acts shall be subject to a fine of up to 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(1) Failing to report in accordance with the prescribed procedures, or making false reports.</p>
<p>(2) Transporting and selling taxed tobacco and alcohol without reporting for inspection.</p>

<p>Article 14: For tobacco shreds and alcohol subject to production-based tax collection, and alcohol subject to installment tax payment, the taxes payable must be paid in full within the current month or installments. If the payment is overdue, the competent collection agency may transfer the case to the court for collection based on the higher tax amount at the time of the tax arrears or determination, and shall be punished in accordance with the following provisions.</p>
<p>(1) If the payment is overdue by more than one month, a fine of 15% of the amount of tax recovered shall be imposed.</p>
<p>(2) If the payment is overdue by more than two months, a fine of 30% of the amount of tax recovered shall be imposed.</p>
<p>Article 15: The recovery of fines and suspension of business under these regulations shall be carried out by the court by ruling.</p>
<p>Appeals may be filed against the preceding ruling within five days, but no further appeals shall be allowed. The court may set a deadline for the person subject to the penalty to pay the fine and the amount to be recovered, and if the payment is overdue, it shall be enforced.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Commemorating American Independence</h3>
<p>Today, 171 years ago, the American colonies united thirteen states, bravely resisting the high-pressure policies of Great Britain. Although militarily they were in the darkest period, the Continental Congress issued a "Declaration of Independence" on that day, declaring that the politics of all countries should be based on the inherent rights of mankind, and that freedom and equality should be the highest guiding principles. From then on, July 4th is not only the National Day of the United States, worthy of warm celebration by the American people; but also the greatest day in modern history. For more than 170 years, the demands of all nations for independence and liberation and the demands of people in all countries for political democratization have been in full swing, and it can be said that they have been inspired and influenced by this Declaration of Independence. Therefore, every year when July 4th arrives, we not only celebrate American National Day, but also pray for the future of human freedom and equality. We look back on the past and deeply understand the difficulty of starting a business and founding a country, and we look squarely at the current international environment and feel even more that the future of mankind is full of thorns. Taking advantage of American Independence Day, we would like to express our usual expectations for the United States.</p>
<p>First, the United States is a newly emerging country that first awakened and rose up. In the history of modern political thought, it first revealed the inherent rights of mankind and sang the slogans of freedom and equality. Subsequently, revolutionary movements in various countries surged, demanding national liberation and independence externally, and demanding freedom and equality for the people internally. It can be said that they were the result of the influence of the American Revolution. Therefore, for more than 170 years, the American Revolution, in the United States itself, has been completely successful. The United States has not only been liberated from British rule, but none of the principles revealed in its Declaration of Independence have not been realized. Today, the United States is leading all countries in the world to work together to create world peace. But from afar, for more than 170 years, the ideals that the United States has longed for have not been fully realized. Looking at today's world, how many nations are still subject to the rule of other countries and cannot talk about freedom and equality at all; and looking at the political situation in various countries, there are also many countries where the people are still manipulated by a few people and cannot talk about democratic politics at all. The United States is in a leading position internationally, and it cannot but bear a special responsibility for world peace and the basic rights of the people. The United States should redouble its efforts to promote itself and others, so that all nations can be liberated and not controlled by any country; so that the people of all countries can enjoy the rights of freedom and equality and no longer be threatened by any totalitarian regime; in this way, people can truly believe that the United States participated in the two world wars indeed "for democracy." In order to fulfill its responsibilities, the United States government should take a long-term view of the entire world and implement a foreign policy that should not be divided into Europe and the United States, let alone Europe and Asia. We feel that the current crisis in the world lies in ideological conflicts. Although the United States is a newly emerging country with only more than 170 years of history, the thoughts of the American people are still nothing more than the two major meanings of the independence revolution—nationalism and democracy. Moreover, its longing ideals have not yet been fully realized. Therefore, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov criticized the American-style democratic politics as 18th-century democratic politics. Although this is Molotov's satire, we cannot but recognize the current hidden worries of the United States. The US authorities must be especially vigilant, face reality squarely, and maintain that the United States will always be a newly emerging country, always standing at the forefront of the times.</p>
<p>Second, the United States sincerely hopes that the post-war world can truly enter a new era of peace and democracy, which no one can deny; but the US government authorities are well aware of the post-war crisis, that some nations are currently being interfered with and oppressed by other countries; that the people of some countries have no freedom at all; and that world politics cannot be democratized, and there is no peace to speak of internationally. In order to help other countries resist external threats, and at the same time to help the people of other countries build democratic, unified, and powerful countries, President Truman proposed the aid bill to Greece and Turkey, which has become the Truman Doctrine known to everyone today. Weighing the Truman Doctrine from the current international situation, whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, you cannot criticize it, but from the actual foreign policy of the United States, the scope of implementation of the so-called Truman Doctrine is limited to one corner of Europe. The "European Aid Plan" proposed by Secretary of State Marshall is considered by everyone to be the second chapter of the Truman Doctrine, which is a good explanation. With such generosity, it is logical that it will be unanimously welcomed by European countries and will never be distorted or accused of harboring imperialist ambitions by the United States to help other countries. Standing in the position of a third party, and speaking fairly, the misunderstandings between countries are caused by the incomplete US policies. Therefore, we cannot but tell the US government that any policy or any doctrine has its integrity and continuity, otherwise it will not become a policy or a doctrine. The best way to stop slander is to cultivate oneself. The United States should reflect on itself. Helping the recovery of Europe is necessary, and helping Asia also has the same need. Why does the United States only want to help Europe? It is inevitable that the Soviet Union will suspect the intentions of the United States. Now that the foreign ministers' meeting of the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union has broken up unhappily, Secretary of State Marshall's European aid plan will have to be reconsidered.</p>
<p>In short, today's world needs the help of the United States, not only urgently, but also in a large amount; on the contrary, post-war America, for the sake of world peace, and for the sake of its own future, also needs to help the recovery of various countries in the world, because the prosperity of the United States does not completely rely on its domestic consumption, but is built on the world market. Therefore, it is hoped that the war-torn countries that are seeking US assistance will know how to regenerate themselves before they can get help; that is, those who help themselves will be helped by heaven. The United States, which is helping other countries, must also understand that helping others is helping oneself. In order to achieve its goals for its far-reaching ideals, assistance to other countries cannot be subject to any conditions. The United States needs to give special consideration to the current situation in China.</p>
<p>Finally, July 4th is also the National Day of the Republic of the Philippines, and we are willing to celebrate the National Day of the Philippines with the same feelings, and hope that China and the Philippines will work together to jointly maintain lasting peace in the Pacific!</p>

<h3>Britain and France Decide to Convene a European Conference to Discuss Secretary Marshall's Aid Plan for Europe; the Soviet Union is Also Invited to Participate; the Date is Set for July 12th and the Location is Still Paris</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Paris, 3rd Broadcast: Britain and France will convene a general assembly of 24 European countries. The date is set for July 12th and the location is Paris. They will discuss Secretary Marshall's plan to revive Europe. Invitations have been issued to European countries, with the exception of Spain.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Paris, 3rd Broadcast: The 24-nation European conference is scheduled to convene on the 12th. The purpose is to quickly formulate a plan to be submitted to the United States before September 1st.</p>
<p>Further News: The French side today sent an invitation to Soviet Minister Bogomolov, along with a letter hoping that the Soviet Union will change its attitude, not insist, and participate in the European recovery effort.</p>
<p>[Our Report] London, 3rd Broadcast: Britain and France issued a joint communique stating: The British and French governments decided to invite European countries (excluding Spain) to participate in drafting the European recovery plan, reviewing the resources and needs of each country, so that each country can have the right to decide freely. The communique did not mention a word about the failure of the Soviet Union and the British-French-Soviet tripartite meeting.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 3rd] British Foreign Minister Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault met again today, probably to continue discussing US Secretary of State Marshall's aid plan for European recovery. At the same time, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has set off to return home. This has made the disagreement between Britain and France and the Soviet Union on the Marshall Plan even more dramatic.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] US officials today believe that the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the European recovery effort was also expected, but senior diplomatic circles are particularly depressed by it. US officials hope that Britain and France will not close the opportunity for the Soviet Union to participate when proceeding alone.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 3rd] It is expected here that Bevin will return to London on Thursday afternoon, and it is believed that Bidault will fly to London on Friday or Saturday. A British-French joint invitation will be issued a few days later, inviting all European countries other than the Soviet Union to participate. According to the opinions of diplomats here, the real reason for the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate is that it is deeply afraid that the success of the Marshall Plan will weaken its control over most of Eastern European countries. It is reported that the question of which countries may participate has not yet been discussed. It is believed that the countries that may participate will include Luxembourg, Italy, Greece, Switzerland, the Western-occupied areas of Germany, Denmark, and Norway may also be included. Sweden is difficult to determine due to its geographical proximity to the Soviet Union. It is also believed that some countries, such as Czechoslovakia, are in a difficult position due to Molotov's decision, because it is a well-known fact that the Czechs are willing to participate in the Marshall Plan. The Soviet Union's aid to these poor countries cannot match that of the United States, but it is questionable whether Eastern European countries dare to offend the Soviet Union and accept the British and French invitations. According to observers, one of the most significant results of this meeting is that France has for the first time since 1944 clearly stated that it shares its fate with the West, and even expressed hostility to the goals of the Soviet Union. This sudden shift to the right is likely to cause serious internal friction in France, where the Communist Party is the only political party of the rightest force in the country.</p>
<h3>After the Failure of the British-French-Soviet Foreign Ministers' Meeting, Europe Will Be Divided into Two; British Officials Believe the Future is Particularly Pessimistic</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 2nd] After the Soviet Union refused to participate in Marshall's European economic recovery plan on the 2nd, Europe was divided into two from the Baltic Sea, along Stettin in northern Germany to Trieste in eastern Italy. As far as is expected, during the four-month-long dream period when the four-power foreign ministers' meeting opens in London in November, Western countries will engage in the work of the Marshall Plan, while the Soviet Union will find ways to strengthen its position behind the "Iron Curtain."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] The State Department tonight has fully prepared to proceed with the Marshall Plan to help European recovery, regardless of the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate with Britain and France. Senior officials in London frankly admit that the British Cabinet is extremely pessimistic about the future of the Marshall Plan. Although Britain and France intend to proceed as planned regardless of the Soviet Union, any plan is very likely to miscarry without the support of the Soviet Union and its allies. Therefore, the United Kingdom has prepared to greatly reduce imports in case the Marshall Plan fails.</p>
<h3>Lie Expresses Regret over the Failure of the Paris Conference</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 2nd] UN Secretary-General Lie expressed regret when he heard the news about the breakdown of the Paris Tripartite Conference, and told a press conference that the United Nations will continue to work on this to implement Marshall's European recovery plan.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Will Allow Germany to Increase Steel Production; Secretary Marshall Refuses to Comment on the Failure of the Paris Conference</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] The United States expected early on that the Soviet Union would refuse the British and French plan to aid Europe. Although Secretary of State Marshall refused to comment on it at a press conference today, he revealed information that the United States and Britain will instigate a recovery plan regardless of the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate. He briefly stated: The British and American occupation zones in Germany will soon announce revisions to their industrial production standards, and will allow steel production to increase to 10 million tons per year, which is double the tonnage agreed by the four powers. Although Secretary Marshall did not state that Britain and the United States had expected the Soviet Union to refuse to participate in this European aid plan, the imminent announcement of industrial production can prove that the two countries have indeed made preparations to promote the recovery of Germany. When asked about his views after the failure of the Paris Conference, Secretary Marshall refused to comment.</p>
<h3>Right-Wingers Pound Tables and Yell: Absurd Drama in the French Parliament; Black Forest Party Case Serious</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 2nd] During a meeting of the French National Assembly tonight, when Premier Ramadier mentioned the recently exposed "Blue Plan" rebellion plot, Lannelongue, leader of the right-wing Republican Liberty Party, accused the premier of defaming the right-wing members of the National Assembly, leading to a heated verbal battle. The assembly hall was thrown into chaos, with constant pounding of tables and yelling. The assembly broke up in discord.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 2nd] Since the exposure of the "Black Forest Party" treasonous conspiracy in France, an investigation is underway, but all information is being kept strictly secret. The case appears to be more serious than initially imagined. It is reported that the Minister of the Interior, when reporting on this case to the cabinet this morning, stated, "This is not merely the discovery of a secret arms depot." As for the names of the suspects, the Minister of the Interior refused to announce them before obtaining sufficient evidence. However, the activities of one key suspect, Chasseur, son of the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, have been revealed. In addition, the dismissal of General Larminat, Commander-in-Chief of the French Colonial Army, is one of the most shocking decisions made by the cabinet today.</p>
<h3>New Indonesian Cabinet Formed; New Prime Minister is Sjahrifoeddin; Progressive Muslim Salim Appointed Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>[United Press, Yogyakarta, 3rd] After a week of consultations, the Indonesian Socialist Party, Labor Party, and Nationalist Party finally agreed today to form a coalition cabinet led by Sjahrifoeddin, a member of the Socialist Party and former Minister of Defense. President Sukarno then announced the appointment of Sjahrifoeddin as the new Prime Minister, succeeding Sjahrir. Sjahrifoeddin, 40, has served as a cabinet member since the establishment of the Republic of Indonesia. Although he belongs to the same party as former Prime Minister Sjahrir, he is not part of the moderate faction. Generally, Sjahrifoeddin is considered the politician most capable of controlling the Indonesian army. The recent cabinet crisis that forced Sjahrir to resign occurred because Sjahrifoeddin personally refused to support him. When the Japanese invaded Java, Sjahrifoeddin was sentenced to death, but Sukarno managed to reduce the sentence to life imprisonment. He regained his freedom after Japan surrendered. Later, he was imprisoned by the Dutch authorities for a year for engaging in national movements.</p>
<p>[United Press, Yogyakarta, 3rd] It is reported that Gani, a member of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, and Sitiadjie, a member of the Labor Party, have been appointed as Deputy Prime Ministers to assist the new Prime Minister Sjahrifoeddin in forming the cabinet. Sjahrifoeddin and Gani will also retain their positions as Minister of Defense and Minister of Economy, respectively. The progressive Muslim Salim will serve as Foreign Minister. Salim is currently working to gain recognition of the Republic of Indonesia from the Arab League.</p>

<h3>British Dominions Office Renamed; Titles of the British Monarch Will Also Change</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons today that the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Dominions Office will be renamed the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations and the Commonwealth Relations Office, because some people both within and outside Britain believe that the term "Dominion" can cause misunderstanding about the relationship between the United Kingdom and other countries within the Commonwealth. The agency's political reporter, Weyden, also stated that after the term "Dominion" is abolished, the titles of King George VI in relation to the Dominions will also change. The King's original title, "George VI, King of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas," will now be "George VI, King of Great Britain, Canada, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand."</p>

<h3>Tensions Gradually Increase in Japanese Parliament; Katayama Tetsu Calls for Cooperation; Yoshida Raises the Issue of a Two-Party System</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] On the third day of the Japanese Diet session, Yoshida, President of the Liberal Party, began by questioning the government. The main points were: (1) Democratic countries must adopt a free economy and need appropriate economic policies. What decisions has the government made in this regard? (2) Regarding the restoration of foreign trade, is the government adequately prepared? (3) The most serious problems currently are unemployment countermeasures and the import of industrial raw materials. Is the government fully prepared for this? (4) It is generally considered fair for the politics of democratic Japan to be managed by two healthy major parties, but what is the government's course of action? I would like to know the details. Prime Minister Katayama responded: (1) While it is not impossible to have politics managed by two major parties, at present, national unity and cooperation are needed to overcome the various crises. (2) In view of the importance of trade, we are determined to devote all our efforts to ensure its smooth progress. (3) The import of raw materials is indeed necessary, but decisions can only be made after the peace treaty conference.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] In the House of Councillors, regarding land reform and immigration issues, Katayama replied: Land reform aims to abolish landlords and implement land reform, and efforts will be made to solve basic problems.</p>
<p>Immigration Policy</p>
<p>Regarding the immigration issue, measures most suitable for our nation will be adopted. Subsequently, Ichimatsu Sadakichi raised questions about democracy, the official price system, and food requisition. Katayama replied: Democracy differs from totalitarianism; it is a movement of the entire people demanding freedom. Currently, only a portion of the people enjoy freedom, while the majority of the people have no freedom to speak of. In order for the entire nation to enjoy freedom, those who currently enjoy freedom exclusively should endure and sacrifice their excessive freedom. A national pact has been made, and efforts are being made to achieve its realization.</p>
<p>Price Control System</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of officially set prices, Wada, Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board, replied: The system of officially set prices cannot be stopped under the current economic conditions. Regarding the food issue, Minister of Agriculture Hirano replied: Improvements to the rice requisition system are planned for the rice harvested this autumn.</p>
<p>Reparations Issue</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo] Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry, Mizutani Chozaburo, replied to the Diet on the 3rd, stating that Japan has requested the Allied authorities to consider the industrial equipment in the reparations because the removal of industrial equipment will "seriously affect" Japan's recovery. Mizutani also requested that the Japanese government should faithfully implement the Allied's reparations decisions. He expressed his hope that the Allies would impose the "minimum" reparations on Japan, guaranteeing Japan's "minimum" living standards in peacetime.</p>

<h3>Amendment to Local Tax Law Causes Difficulties for the Bureau of Finance; The Vast Majority of Households in This City May Be Exempt from Property Tax</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to sources, the Central Government's amendment to the various local tax laws includes a provision in Article 6, Section 2 of the property tax regulations, which stipulates that "houses for personal use by residents, not exceeding one room per person," are also exempt from property tax. After receiving this new regulation, the local financial authorities believed that Shanghai was experiencing a serious housing shortage and that land was extremely valuable. Many residents lived in houses for personal use with no more than one room per person. Granting exemptions would significantly impact tax revenue. After research, it was believed that there was a typographical error and it should have read "not exceeding one room per household." An electrical request for interpretation was sent to the Ministry of Finance in March. The Ministry of Finance also believed that this provision was not practical and had already amended the proposal, which was submitted to the Executive Yuan and approved by the Legislative Yuan with the reply: "No amendment is needed." This means that exemptions should still be based on the original amended regulations, i.e., any citizen using a house not exceeding one room per person can be exempt from property tax. However, the Ministry of Finance believes that this matter is of great importance, related to local tax revenue and the burden on all citizens. It is still under detailed study and amendment. Before the amendment, the original exemption standards will still be followed, i.e., any citizen using a house not exceeding one room per person can be exempt from property tax. The above instruction has already been received by the Municipal Bureau of Finance. However, according to reliable sources, the Bureau of Finance believes that this case is related to local tax revenue and is extremely difficult to handle. Since the housing shortage in this city is so serious, most people use no more than one room per person. In other words, most households in this city can be exempt from property tax. Therefore, the municipal financial authorities will argue with reason and strive to get the Legislative Yuan to amend the proposal as it is.</p>

<h3>International Cooperation Day Tomorrow; All Sectors to Hold Commemorative Meetings</h3>

<h3>First Batch of Japanese Reparation Warships Arrives in Shanghai; Three Destroyers and Five Escort Ships, Totaling Approximately 10,000 Tons; Docking at Gaochangmiao, Ceremony to Be Held on the 6th</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The first batch of eight Japanese warships and one escort ship as reparations to our country, piloted by 250 Japanese sailors led by Okada, with Navy Staff Officer Zhong Hanbo, a major in our delegation to Japan, and U.S. Navy Lieutenant Cossa as escorts, set sail from Sasebo at noon on the 1st and arrived at Gaochangmiao anchorage at 6:00 PM yesterday. A grand reception ceremony and flag-raising ceremony will be held at the Jiangnan Shipyard on the morning of the 6th.</p>
<p>At around 5:30 AM yesterday, the naval watchtower outside the Yangtze River estuary spotted the silhouettes of these nine warships. The naval authorities here sent General Staff Zhuang Huaiyuan, Commander Lin Binglai of the Dinghai warship, and Commander Chen Shu of the Puan warship, leading more than a hundred naval soldiers on two reception ships and Jiangfang boats, to wait outside the estuary in advance. At 2:00 PM, the nine warships arrived at Wusongkou, and our naval officers and soldiers boarded the ships to take over and led them into the Huangpu River in order. The escort ship "Wakataka" led the way, followed by the reparation ships "Yukikaze", "No. 14", "No. 194", "Kaede", "Hatsukume", "No. 67", "Yotsuzaka", and "No. 25". From 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM, the ships passed through the Bund area one after another, and the citizens on the riverside gathered to watch, all with smiles of victory. At around 6:00 PM, they arrived at the waters near the Jiangnan Shipyard in Gaochangmiao and anchored.</p>
<p>The Eight Ships Are Still Relatively New</p>
<p>Among these eight reparation warships, three are destroyers and five are escort ships. They are all painted dark gray and appear quite old. The styles are different, and the sizes vary. The heaviest ship weighs 2,490 tons, and the lightest weighs 900 tons, with a total tonnage of 10,460 tons. The ships all fly the Japanese merchant flag and the international E flag, a red and blue reparations flag with green edges. The ship type, tonnage, and year of manufacture of each ship are as follows: "Yukikaze", destroyer, 2,490 tons, completed in 1938; "Hatsukume", destroyer, 1,580 tons, completed in 1945; "Kaede", destroyer, 1,530 tons, completed in 1945; "Yotsuzaka", escort ship, 1,020 tons, completed in 1944; "No. 67", escort ship, 1,020 tons, completed in 1944; "No. 215", escort ship, 1,020 tons, completed in 1945; "No. 14", escort ship, 900 tons, completed in 1945; "No. 194", escort ship, 900 tons, completed in 1945.</p>
<p>Encountered Heavy Fog En Route</p>
<p>After the ships docked, the reporter visited Major Zhong Hanbo. According to him, they encountered heavy fog en route, and the operation of the "No. 215" warship was also temporarily disrupted. In this four-nation lottery, the UK received 9,340 tons, the U.S. received 9,220 tons, and the Soviet Union received 9,530 tons, all less than our country. Although the number of warships remaining in the Japanese Navy after the war is still considerable, most of them are dilapidated. Among them, those that can be utilized, up to now, include 25 destroyers and 67 escort destroyers, totaling 92 ships. After the consent of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, they were evenly divided, and each country received 23 ships. The second batch of eight ships as reparations to our country is expected to sail to China by the end of this month. The dispatch of these eight ships to Shanghai was ordered by the Allied Headquarters in Japan, and Japanese sailors were ordered to deliver them, with a separate escort ship accompanying them. This escort ship will only stay in Shanghai for 72 hours and then transport all the Japanese sailors back to Japan. Zhong will then return to Tokyo to report to the Chinese delegation to Japan.</p>

<h3>Profit Tax for the 36th Year; Account Audits to Be Suspended Immediately</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The simplification of tax collection procedures for the 36th-year profit tax, which has been strongly advocated by the business community and representative bodies of this city, has been agreed upon by the Ministry of Finance to implement simplified standards on a trial basis. Over the past half month, the nine-member group of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has continuously consulted with the Direct Tax Bureau, Director Wang Fuzhou, and Director Lou Guo on various technical issues related to the standardization of the blessings, originally scheduled to be implemented today, but some issues remain to be discussed, and the date has to be extended. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce again sent a letter to the Direct Tax Bureau the day before yesterday, requesting a speedy resolution of the percentage of sample account books for simplified standards, how to leniently determine depreciation, inventory, and expenses, and budget allocation issues. It is reported that the Direct Tax Bureau has inquired about the request of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and has stopped the overall audit of accounts immediately.</p>
<h3>Falsely Accused of Theft; University Student Files a Lawsuit</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Feng Zhuzhu, Deputy Manager of Donglai Bank, entrusted He Deqi, the former Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, to sell a Western-style house at No. 45 Shengpingwei, Maoming Road, in early May of last year. The asking price at the time was 470 million yuan. Tao Ying, a university student, learned of this and introduced Zhang Xuemin and others to see the house on May 9th of this year. Feng's son led the tour. The next day, Tao, accompanied by lawyers Feng and Chen Rizheng, went to negotiate, but Feng changed the price to US$65,000, which at the time was equivalent to more than 600 million yuan, exceeding the original price by more than 200 million yuan, leading to a quarrel. Feng went out to call the police, claiming that there were robbers, and the police station dispatched a large number of police officers to arrest Tao and others. After clarifying the situation, they were released. However, Tao was unwilling to accept this and filed a lawsuit yesterday at the District Prosecutor's Office, accusing Feng Zhuzhu's son of disrupting order and falsely accusing them of theft. The District Prosecutor's Office will summon both parties for questioning in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Sending Six Teams to Various Buildings; Investigating and Dismantling Intercom Telephones; 19 Homes Confiscated; 18 Homes Suspected of Illegal Installation</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Starting at 9:00 AM yesterday, the Economic Section of the Police Bureau, together with technical personnel from the Public Utilities Bureau and the Shanghai Telephone Company, divided into six teams of eight people each, went to the Securities, Gauze, and Overseas Chinese Buildings to cut and dismantle illegally installed intercom telephones. As of 1:00 PM, the companies found and confiscated included four companies in the Gauze Building: Jitai Yarn Thread Company, Changyu Company, Yuanxingchang Company, and Changji Company. Other companies, including Jinlong, Chengmao, Zhenxiang, and Jinkang, are suspected of illegal installation. In the Overseas Chinese Building, there are five companies: Dakang, Hengyongyuan, Xinji, Liji Gold Company, and Yimao.

Fourteen other companies are suspected of illegal installation. According to Xu Youzuo, the head of the Economic Section, the number of intercom telephones found and confiscated today (i.e., yesterday) was not large because the report had been published too early in the newspapers, and merchants had been alert and had mostly dismantled them themselves. However, the Bureau will continue to monitor closely. As for the results of the inspection of the trading houses, they will be presented by the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank at the next economic meeting before they can be announced.</p>

<h3>Embezzlement by Employees of Qian Tai Yu Bank Discovered</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Suzhou, 3rd] A Class 4 slow train on the Beijing-Shanghai line, arriving at the Huxuguan Station at 2:30 AM on the 3rd, was suddenly boarded by six bandits. As the train departed, they began searching and robbing passengers. The passengers' losses were estimated at more than ten million yuan. When the train reached near Huqiu, the bandits jumped off the train and fled. The railway police are currently investigating.</p>
<p>According to the Xinhua Huadong News Agency: On the 25th of last month, passengers Lin Amao, Zhu Jingui, and Zhu Jinsong, traveled from Wuxi to Shanghai on the 57th Class 4 train on the Beijing-Shanghai line. At around 4:00 PM, when the train reached near Zhenru, a soldier sitting opposite them suddenly seized the travel bag (containing 2.1 million yuan) carried by Zhu Jinsong. Zhu shouted "Robber!", but the soldier, unable to succeed, jumped onto the roof of the car from the crowd and escaped without a trace. Before long, the soldier suddenly returned to Zhu's seat accompanied by three others wearing military uniforms. First, they shined a bright flashlight on Zhu's face, making them dizzy, and then they repeatedly struck Zhu and the others on the head with wooden sticks. At the same time, they seized Zhu's luggage bag and tried to jump off the train and escape. At that time, Lin Amao and Zhu Jingui were knocked unconscious by the sticks, but Zhu Jinsong was still conscious and grabbed the travel bag at the car door, struggling to hold on. One of them was arrested by the railway police on the train. The arrested confessed his name as Su Yunyi, a deserter from the First Company of the Machine Gun Battalion of the 186th Brigade of the 83rd Army, who, together with Yuan Zhong, Wang Biao, Xiao Zhou, and others, conspired to steal on the train. On the same day, they forcibly robbed 2.3 million yuan on the same train. The gathering place was in the brothel in Fuxiang, opposite the Xiaocaichang on Qiujiang Road and Zhapu Road. The Police Department has decided to transfer the suspect to the Garrison Headquarters for strict handling within a few days and has ordered the arrest of his accomplices.</p>

I only have death left, so I beg the union to find a solution." It continued to say, "Although being passionately in love with a male worker in the same factory is detrimental to social customs, men and women harmonizing is said to be human nature by Confucius.

<h3>Heat Sets Record This Year; Today May Be Even Hotter</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The weather in the city has been unusually hot and muggy for several days. Yesterday, the highest temperature reached 95 degrees Fahrenheit, setting a new heat record for this year. The time was around 2:00 PM. The lowest temperature also reached 76.9 degrees, which was around 6:00 AM. The reason for the mugginess is that a strong low-pressure system in the Pacific basin is moving towards mainland China. At the same time, the southeast and southwest winds in southern China are strong, carrying the humid heat of mainland China to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Currently, the area from the Yangtze River to the coastal areas of North China is shrouded in a low-pressure system, so the heat flow will be difficult to dissipate within one or two days, and today may be even hotter than yesterday. According to the highest temperature record for July in the past 70 years, it was 104 degrees in 1934 of the Republic. The weather forecast released by the Meteorological Observatory is recorded below: Yellow Sea: Cloudy, hot, thunderstorms, morning fog, fresh south to west winds, moderate waves. Central China: Cloudy, clear, hot, morning fog, local evening showers, moderate south to west winds. Shanghai: Cloudy, clear, hot, haze in the morning and evening, Yangtze River downstream, evening thunderstorms, moderate south to west winds. East China Sea: Cloudy, clear, light fog along the coast in the morning, moderate east to south winds, moderate waves.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation; Medicine and Hygiene</h3>
<p>(1) Stubborn, Difficult-to-Cure Malaria</p>
<p>Huang Zhenxin asks: My father is over sixty years old and has always been in good health. Recently, his physical strength has suddenly declined. He has been suffering from malaria for nearly a year, and it occurs whenever he works excessively. He did not pay attention to it at first, and it would heal on its own after a day or two. Since the beginning of summer, the condition has become more severe, occurring every day or every other day, greatly damaging his health. May I ask how this disease should be treated to be cured?</p>
<p>[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin] (1) You must first examine the blood to see if there are malaria parasites present. If it is malaria, use "Quinine pills" or "Atebrin." They must be taken according to the doctor's instructions to be effective. Sometimes, injecting arsenic preparations is also effective. In short, it is best to consult a doctor.</p>
<p>(2) High Blood Pressure</p>
<p>Chen Shaoqin asks: I suffered from high blood pressure two years ago, and examinations showed that there were no diseases in the heart and urine. After medical treatment, it is still sometimes high and sometimes low. Now a friend tells me that taking alum can cure high blood pressure, but I do not know (1) whether this statement is reliable? (2) whether regular consumption is harmful to the human body? Please provide detailed instructions for my benefit.</p>
<p>[Answer by Dr. Tang Renjin] (1) Alum has not been mentioned in pharmacology in relation to high blood pressure. It is commonly used as an internal medicine for diarrhea, a gargle for pharyngitis, and a cleansing agent for vaginal discharge. (2) The internal dosage of alum is 0.3-2 grams. If taken in large quantities, it can cause burning pain in the mouth and throat. It can also cause vomiting and diarrhea.</p>

(2) The principle of restoring the Medical College has been determined. He also agreed to the enrollment during the summer vacation, but the college has been abandoned for two years and needs to be redeployed. Experts are currently designing it, and it must be decided after discussion at the school affairs meeting. (3) Expanding equipment is not easy to achieve at once, but Yingshi University currently has sufficient funds, with a net savings of 1.3 billion yuan. There should be no problem if it is purchased gradually. The expansion of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and faculty residences is currently planned. The Colleges of Engineering and Agriculture have already taken shape, and only need to be supplemented in the future. (4) The College of Law urgently needs famous professors. The current treatment in Jinhua has been raised to the first level, and it is believed that there will be no shortage of people coming.

The transfer of various offices has been completed, and except for slight adjustments to the personnel of the Director of General Affairs, the rest are in a state of chaos. However, since June 30th, the heads of various colleges, departments, and offices have automatically resigned, so there should be no problem with personnel adjustments in the future. Students are keeping silent about the details of this aspect.</p>
<p>Currently, the Student Union and all the students are making requests to the new president separately. The students have requested that the semester end early and that the final exams be moved to the next semester, and it is reported that the new president has expressed his agreement. The Student Union, following the public opinion of the students, has put forward the following suggestions to the new president: (1) Please ask the new president to submit a request to President Chiang for approval of the new location of Yingshi University in Hangzhou for the next semester. (2) In the next semester, the Colleges of Law, Agriculture, Engineering, Liberal Arts and Sciences, and Medicine should set up more examination areas and expand enrollment. (3) Adjust personnel fairly and practically, eliminate the weak and retain the strong, as the foundation for the new Yingshi University. (4) The students have been petitioning and running around for several months, all for the sake of the school's future. Their motives are pure and their goals are accurate. Please guarantee the safety of the students. It is reported that the new president has replied to the above four points with "permission to consider," and the students are quite satisfied with this move by the new president. The turbulent situation of Yingshi University for several months may stabilize from now on.</p>

<h3>Increased Pressure, Speculation Retreats Shanghai Stocks Fall Across the Board Yongsha Meiya Falls Below the Daily Limit</h3>
<p>Yesterday, unfavorable conditions plagued Shanghai stocks. The implementation of a 50% cash margin requirement, power restrictions, and the removal of intercom phones left no room for recovery. The bulls could only liquidate their positions with pain. The downward trend intensified. Although there was some recovery due to financial institutions bargain-hunting and short-sellers covering their positions, the hopeless environment and the authorities' removal of intercom phones discouraged activity. Both trading volume inside and outside the exchange decreased significantly. Aside from falling to the limit, Yongsha Meiya traded far below the limit. There is little hope for a recovery in the short term. The opening sentiment was already weak, and most stocks opened lower. Yongsha opened at a low price of 8700 yuan. Due to Yongsha's capital increase, the situation was favorable, and some short-sellers covered their positions. After the opening, transactions for Yongsha were bought by numbers 172, 173, 91, 76, and 177, while transactions for Yongsha were absorbed by numbers 24, 108, 73, and 224, gradually recovering to a current delivery price of 8450 yuan and a deferred delivery price of 8950 yuan.</p>
<p>At this time, the spread between current and deferred prices rose from 370 yuan to 450 yuan, so current delivery Yongsha could not exceed the opening price. Numbers 32, 163, and 85 sold current Yongsha at high prices, and numbers 163, 142, and 199 also sold deferred Yongsha, and the market weakened again. Tongyi by number 180, current Meiya by number 89, Xinho by numbers 17, 73, and 133, current Yongsha by number 35, deferred Meiya by number 105, and current Xinguang by number 142 were gradually pushed to the daily limit. Deferred Yongsha gradually fell to the daily limit of 8390 yuan. Numbers 54 and 24 bought at low prices, and deferred Yongsha rose to 8550 yuan. At this time, numbers 76, 36, and 160 were still selling, and the price fell again to around 8400 yuan. Later, number 177 and number 8 absorbed current Yongsha on behalf of the banking sector, and numbers 95 and 31 also bought, while numbers 218, 94, 228, and 8 also bought deferred Yongsha. Although number 212 and 131 sold a considerable amount of current Yongsha, after 10 AM, current Yongsha recovered to 8350 yuan and deferred Yongsha to 8750 yuan. Numbers 97, 231, 70, and 17 sold current Yongsha, and number 14 also sold deferred Yongsha, and number 85 also closed their positions. Zhongs's lowered to the daily limit by number 160, and deferred Yongsha fell back to within 8600 yuan. After 10:30 AM until 11:15 AM, the market was sluggish, and transactions were sparse. Current delivery Yongsha hovered around 8250 yuan, and deferred delivery yarn hovered around 8600 yuan. The outside interest rate still opened within three corners or so, and the removal of telephones was intensified. The Stock Exchange also issued a notice ordering all brokers not to engage in outside transactions, and people remained nervous. The popular stocks deteriorated further, and their enthusiasm waned. At 11:30 AM, the selling wind started again, and numbers 94, 23, 35, and 157 sold. Current Yongsha by number 154 and 203, and deferred Yongsha by numbers 32 and 223, all hung at the daily limit. Deferred Xinguang by number 131, and Yonggong by number 191, all hung low to the daily limit. After that, the market collapsed. Yongsha by numbers 223, 65, and 148 selling current Yongsha, fell to 7750 yuan, and deferred Yongsha fell to 8050 yuan. Current Meiya at 430 yuan and deferred Meiya at 450 yuan were transacted. Datong, Business, Match, Zhongfang also fell to the limit. As a result, compared with before the close, current stocks such as Yongsha, Xinho, Meiya, Xinguang, Yonggong, and Jingfu all fell to the limit. Hua, Dong, Xing, Zhongfa, and Xinhua each fell by about half. Business, Match, Tongyi, Datong, Zhongs's all fell to the limit. Xinya fell more than half. Zhongfang recovered after falling to the limit. Innerwear, Cement, Lian, and Jinglun each fell by 10%. Deferred stocks such as Yonggong fell by half, Yongsha, Xinho, Meiya, Xinguang, and Jingfu all fell to the limit, and Huafeng fell less than half. In the outside market, old stocks such as Zhabei, Huashang, Zhonghua, and Nanyang decreased slightly, and Dasheng, Wuzhou, and Shijie were flat.</p>
<h3>Limited Transactions for United Bonds and Foreign Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, no one cared about public bonds, and few operators were active, so there were only hundreds of thousands of transactions. Tong Bing opened at 8500 yuan, and 360 rooms sold more than 400,000, immediately falling to 7300 yuan, and then slightly stabilizing. As a result, compared to the pre-close, A, B, and C each fell 400 yuan, Tong Ding fell 600 yuan, and Tong E fell 700 yuan. Amidst the investigation of the black market, the future is difficult to boost.</p>
<p>Yesterday, normal transactions of foreign stocks were temporarily suspended due to the authorities' removal of intercom phones, which made activity inconvenient and transactions extremely limited. Yisha opened at 85,000 yuan and fell to 82,000 yuan before closing. As a result, compared to the pre-close, shipping fell 10%, paper fell slightly, and the remaining stocks each fell about 5%.</p>
<h3>Arbitrage Transactions Greatly Diminished</h3>
<p>The current delivery spread yesterday for Yongsha rose from 370 yuan to 450 yuan, then fell to 270 yuan, closing at 300 yuan. Numbers 185, 156, and 231 posted, while number 177 and the banking sector, including numbers 178, 56, 207, 45, 220, 11, 142, 31, and 112, added to their positions. Deferred delivery lacked activity due to the heavy burden on the Securities Finance Corporation, and transactions were not numerous. After 11:30 AM, the price fell to a low, and the interest rate ranged from 1.2 to 1.9 corners. Xinho ranged from 953 to 190 yuan. Xinguang ranged from 7 yuan to 8.5 yuan, and Huafeng retreated from 5.5 yuan to 4.7 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities Exchange Prohibits Dummy Transactions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Securities Exchange announced to all brokers that the government has strictly prohibited the operation of gold and U.S. dollar transactions, and that black market dummy transactions in securities also violate the law. Most brokers are well aware of the overall situation and know what to avoid. At a time when the government is strictly cracking down, a special warning is given, and it is hoped that they will further self-examine themselves to avoid punishment.</p>
<h3>Uneven Arrivals from Various Places Rice Continues to be Weak Flour Sales Increase then Decrease again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than 10,000 dan of rice arrived in both the northern and southern markets. Most of the arrivals were long-grain rice from the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, with shipments from Shashi, Hankou, Wuhu, Anqing, and Jiujiang, as well as from northern Jiangsu. In the southern market, japonica rice fell by 35,000 to 10,000 yuan, and indica rice also fell by 10,000 to more than 10,000 yuan. White Yuan was still scarce and lacking in transactions, while customer Yuan was the most sluggish. The trend in the northern market was weak.</p>
<p>Flour sales turned sluggish, plummeting by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. Bran also fell by a small amount, 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake sales were active during the peak season, increasing by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybeans were in short supply, continuing to rise by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Tea beans were scarce in both supply and demand, and the market was stable.</p>
<p>Red beans turned flat, and the price was fixed. Raw peanuts saw weak sales and became stagnant. Sesame was scarce and continued to be firm, still heading towards its peak. Sorghum rose secretly, corn from the north was unchanged, falling back 5,000 to 6,000 yuan, and medium-grade corn fell wildly by 10,000 yuan.

<p>Loan Measures for Flour Mills Undetermined</p>
<p>According to information from the flour mill industry, applications for loans for the purchase of wheat have not received a definite answer to date. The mills are eagerly awaiting the Ministry of Food to decide on loan measures in order to obtain sufficient raw materials and maintain production. The Ministry of Food has had several loan measures, but none have been decided upon yet. As a result, the loan has been repeatedly delayed. Currently, the mills are only relying on free funds to purchase a small amount of wheat, so production is intermittent. Yesterday, representatives of the city's five major flour mills contacted the National Bank to negotiate loans, but to no avail because the authorities' loans had not been decided. The industry is currently urging the authorities.</p>
<p>Batch of Soybeans to Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau ordered 10,000 tons of soybeans from the Northeast. To date, only 2,400 tons have been shipped. The remainder has been affected by the war in the Northeast, and imports and exports are restricted, so these soybeans cannot be exported. It is reported that the Bureau's Northeast branch is working to ship 3,600 tons from the Northeast, which will arrive in Shanghai this month. The remaining 4,000 tons are still being shipped. After shipment to Shanghai, all of the soybeans will be delivered to the oil extraction industry to produce edible oil and regulate market supply and demand.</p>
<p>Tendering for Flour and Siamese White Rice</p>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau is holding a public tender for over 900,000 pounds of water-damaged flour and over 50,000 market jin of inferior Siamese white rice. The procedures are as follows: (1) Those who wish to bid can go to Room 322 on the third floor of 74 Renji Road to inquire about the price and obtain "Tender Notice."

<h3>New Plan Decided for Purchasing Export Goods</h3>
<p>The 15th meeting of the Export Promotion Committee was held in the Central Bank meeting room on the 1st. The issues discussed that day did not reach a conclusion. The meeting continued on the 2nd and ended in the afternoon. It is reported that the issues discussed at this meeting were: 1. The purchase of export goods; 2. The purchase and sale of raw silk. Regarding the former, a new plan has been decided and submitted to the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economic Affairs, and National Economic Commission for approval. Regarding the latter, a separate group has been formed to review it. It is reported that the purchase method in the future will entrust export merchants to handle it, in order to achieve cooperation between officials and merchants and jointly solve difficulties. Chen Guangfu, the vice-chairman of the committee, took the purchase plan to Beijing on the evening of the 2nd to discuss it with the relevant departments in the central government, so that the current deadlock could be broken quickly.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Silverware Industry Complain to the Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The silverware industry, seeing that the resumption of business has been delayed until now and that the central government has not issued a clear order, finds it difficult to maintain business if it continues like this, and the livelihood of workers will also be cut off. Yesterday afternoon, representatives were sent: Jie Gen, Yao Guiqing, Chen Dezhang, and Wu Pengnian, four representatives met with Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated their appeals, and asked them to forward them to the central government to find out if there is any way to continue to maintain the industry. Otherwise, they will simply lay off workers to avoid dragging them down. Director Wu promised to raise this issue at this week's municipal meeting.</p>
<p>According to Director Wu's words to reporters, he will ask Mayor Wu to telegraph the central government before the central government has approved it, asking them to find a way to remedy the situation. This is because the city's silverware industry employs more than 30,000 workers, and if calculated on the basis of a family of three, if they are laid off, 100,000 people will have no means of living, which will become a serious social problem.</p>
<p>According to people in the silverware industry, the business of silverware and silver utensils usually accounts for only one-fiftieth of the total business. If only silver business is operated, it is impossible to maintain. Moreover, few people exchange silver bracelets and rings and wear gold jewelry, and it is difficult to guarantee that silver will not have a black market.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Price Downstream</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market, due to the weak opening price of cotton yarn and the slack demand from yarn mills, market sentiment was soft.

In the afternoon, the closing price of cotton yarn slightly improved, yarn mills took some demand, and customer groups also added some, the market was weak but firm, and transactions were slightly stronger. The offer price of each stall was 1.98 million for Lingbao cotton sent to the factory, and 1.6 million for Hankou coarse velvet. The stock price was 1.57 million for Chongtongzhou, 1.85 million for Shashi, 1.9 million for Lingbao. 1.93 million, 1.94 million to 1.95 million, 1.64 million for Hankou fine cotton, 1.62 million for Tongzhou, 1.65 million for Hankou, and 260,000 to 280,000 per group for Zhoupu seed cotton.</p>

<h3>Measures Determined for Handling Pledged Tea from 1946 Loans Expire and Should be Redeemed, No Extensions Allowed</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The United Four Banks held its 347th board meeting this morning, presided over by Vice Chairman Zhang Qun. Attendees included Directors Yu Hongjun, Zhang Jia'ao, Xu Kan, Chen Guofu, Chen Qitian, Zhao Dihua, Li Shumin, and Secretary-General Xu Boyuan, Director Wu Rencang, Director Gu Chunfan, and General Manager Shou Miancheng. In addition to approving 81 loan cases, they later passed the 1946 tea loan case, the measures for handling pledged box tea, and the measures for promoting the 1947 tea loan, excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Measures for handling pledged box tea from 1946: The total amount of tea loans in 1946 was originally approved by Deputy Chairman Song as 7 billion yuan. After the tea merchants made box tea, the market price abroad was lower than the domestic cost. They also requested that the box tea be used as collateral at 70% off to transfer it into a box tea pledge loan in order to end the tea loan. During November, the Farmers Bank and the Central Bank agreed and repeatedly increased the pledge loan, totaling 20 billion yuan. This box tea has been shipped to Shanghai for nearly a year, and it should be urgently planned for sale to avoid stagnation. The following four points have now been decided on: (1) From July 10th, the box tea pledge loan will expire and no extensions will be allowed. If the tea merchants do not have the funds to redeem the tea, the collateral will be disposed of. (2) From now until July 20th, tea merchants may apply to the China Trust Bureau to purchase the box tea. (3) Before the purchased box tea is exported, the China Trust Bureau should consult with the competent authorities to re-inspect all of it. Tea that does not meet the standards may not be exported. (4) Other export box tea from various places that has been shipped to Shanghai in 1946 may also apply in accordance with this method and be purchased by the China Trust Bureau.</p>
<p>Measures for Promoting this Year's Tea Loan</p>
<p>The total amount of the 1947 tea loan is 28 billion yuan, which has been successively loaned by the Farmers Bank. The remaining 53.9 billion yuan for transportation and sales loans for export locations should be approved and released by the Farmers Bank. The government has a purchase plan for major export goods, and tea is also one of the purchase targets. In order to cooperate with the government's policies, the following three points have been approved: (1) The scope of purchase includes all tea that meets export standards and cannot be transported and sold by tea merchants. (2) The purchase price is calculated based on the cost of production and transportation plus legal profit. The main organizer presides over the bidding. (3) Purchase deadline: Tea merchants who borrow from the Farmers Bank may apply for purchase at the time of expiration if they have no way to prepare funds for redemption in order to repay the loan. They may not re-apply for purchase a second time.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The silk cocoon loan case in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year has long been completed, and dry cocoons are now being rushed into the warehouse, and silk has begun to be reeled. The department has approved reeling loans according to actual needs.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Market Sentiment Turns Firm</h3>

American cigarettes were flat, while loose cigarettes all decreased slightly.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Weak then Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market, due to the authorities' strict price controls and inspections of yarn and cloth merchants, market sentiment was weak and transactions were very weak. After the opening of the market, some floating households settled their positions, and prices fell. Near the closing, local dyeing and weaving factories bought in, and some also absorbed purchases at low prices, so prices rose again. Twenty-count Shuangma yarn once fell to 9.4 million yuan, but finally closed at 10.1 million yuan, an increase of more than 20,000 yuan compared to Monday. Except for a slight decrease in 42-count and 40-count fine yarn, the prices of coarse yarn such as 20-count, 16-count, and 10-count all rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.

It is said that in the 23rd allocation next week, the price of sugar in each grade must be increased by at least one-quarter, and the allocation price of medium-grade granulated sugar will be sold for 500,000 yuan per 100 "jin".</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday, the 22nd quota of Taiwan Sugar remained the same, and the price also lacked change. However, the market for white sugar was tighter. Peruvian sugar was 6,780,000 yuan, and 20 medium-grade granulated white sugar was 6,000,000 to 6,100,000 yuan. Four-and-a-half-car white sugar was 6,340,000 yuan, Xingchi red sugar was 5,780,000 yuan, and at the same time, local sugar was slightly looser. Shantou green sugar was 420,000 yuan, a slight increase of 5,000 yuan. Mianchi red sugar was 470,000 yuan, a slight increase of 12,000 yuan. Xinghua white Gaozhuang was 5,580,000 yuan, followed by 5,500,000 to 5,450,000 yuan. Xinghua red sugar was 4,450,000 yuan, all with a slight increase of 12,000 yuan, totaling more than 500 "gong". Diao green sugar was 380,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Relatively Active</h3>
<p>The first half of the year's settlement period for silver money businesses has swiftly passed. Yesterday, the tea market situation for domestic sales, in addition to the local street shops and the Suzhou and Guangdong gangs, continued to inquire. New buyers from Fengjing and other areas also frequently approached, making the market more active and colorful than before the holiday, and the prices were also extremely stable. Only Wuchang Dadechang and other tea companies were still absorbing export tea, while the rest were inevitably hesitant. Therefore, the holders of goods tried to stabilize, and the price did not fall. According to people in the industry, the French Yongxing Foreign Company is now consulting with the sellers regarding green tea such as Chun Mee. If a solution can be found, a considerable transaction may occur.</p>
<h3>Soap Sales Mostly Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the daily necessities market opened very lively in the morning, with prices fluctuating slightly. However, by the afternoon market, a general floating of supply appeared on the market, and the market atmosphere suddenly weakened. In the end, Guben soap retreated by 15,000 yuan per box compared to yesterday, to 455,000 yuan. Arrow knife soap was 450,000 yuan, also down slightly by 10,000 yuan. Huangxiangmao, Guanghua, Henry, and Cow Brand soaps all fell by 12,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The match market, due to increased costs and a shortage of raw materials, prices frequently rose, and it was heard that the factory prices were also about to be adjusted, causing people to be optimistic and prices to rise sharply. As a result, Beauty Brand increased by 150,000 yuan per box compared to the previous day, to 3,100,000 yuan. Phoenix and Ningbo also rose by 100,000 yuan, while Nanjing, Tiger, and Caiju, etc., rose by 58,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Revised Restriction Measures for Private Car Imports</h3>
<p>[This newspaper news] The Import Management Committee revised two articles of the restriction measures for foreign travelers bringing private cars into the country, effective yesterday, as follows: (1) Travelers bringing private cars into the country must have proof that they have owned and used the car for more than six months before departing from abroad (excluding Hong Kong and Kowloon) to be eligible to apply for import. However, those departing within one month after the announcement are temporarily allowed to follow the old rules. (2) Travelers entering the country from Hong Kong and Macau are not allowed to bring private cars into the country. However, those departing within two weeks after the announcement are temporarily allowed to follow the old rules.</p>
<p>It is reported that the United States also originally stipulated that travelers must have proof that they have owned and used private cars for more than six months before exporting them to be eligible to apply for export. Now that the provision has been canceled, our country has added the restriction measure in terms of withdrawal management.</p>

<h3>Preface to "Collected Medical Essays of Fan Shi"</h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>Mr. Fan Shouyuan, in his eyes, could not tolerate the chaos and filth of our country's medical affairs. He raised his pen, which could sweep away thousands of troops, and loudly appealed in society for about twenty years. He is now dividing his past to recent writings into five collections, namely the first collection of speeches, the second collection of reviews, the third collection of casual talks, the fourth collection of common sense, and the fifth collection of miscellany, and compiling them into a book called "Collected Medical Essays of Fan Shi," which is about to be published. I have two feelings about the publication of this book.</p>
<p>The first is that our society is not progressing. Almost everyone knows and admits that Chinese culture is backward, and medicine is one of the cultures, so of course it cannot but be backward. Knowing the backwardness and admitting the backwardness, but not having the power to promote it, reform it, unify it, wash it, and even stir it up even more, this is what we cannot tolerate in our eyes and cannot but loudly appeal for. If we could thoroughly understand the reason for the backwardness and strive to improve, catch up, then in these twenty years, the situation would have changed greatly, and Mr. Fan's loudly appealed sound piece would have been a cliché, as if there was no need to broadcast it again. But now, standing up and looking at the environment, those who wildly talk about empty idealistic philosophy are still like that, those who blindly believe in vulgar experience are still like that, those who diagnose diseases by taking the pulse are still like that, those who prescribe prescriptions with traditional decoctions are still like that, and they strive for balance in medical administration and laws, and seek inferiority in academic qualifications. The former is used to defend against coercion, and the latter is used to breed followers, completely centering on their own partial interests, and ignoring the rise and fall of the country, the interests of the people, the international reputation, and the progress and retreat of academics. This style is extremely popular, so for twenty years, progress has stagnated, and it is still the original color of chaos and filth. Following that, Mr. Fan's loudly appealed record has also lasted for twenty years, as if it is still brand new and there is a need to broadcast it again. Under this feeling, I am embarrassed to congratulate Mr. Fan, but instead want to mourn for society.</p>
<p>The second is that people in our society do not understand too much. I often say that speaking requires someone on the other side. Zhong Ziqi was a confidant of Bo Ya's "qin" (zither). After Zhong Ziqi died, Bo Ya broke the "qin" and stopped playing it. This story is what we often use, so Zhuangzi has the saying "Loud sounds do not enter the ears." "Li er" means vulgar ears and eyes. Now the immaturity of the thinking of the Chinese people is really alarming. There are still people who stick to metaphysics from the sixth and seventh centuries, treating it as their precious possession, and being arrogant and boastful. In such a society, telling them scientific truth will not make them listen to us calmly. The root cause is that they do not understand our speech. How many people have resonated with Mr. Fan's loudly appealed for twenty years? Try to look at the stagnation and non-progress of medical affairs to test how much effect our words have had. The act of breaking the "qin" is a profound reflection of society. Several of my colleagues often think that criticism of old medicine is a useless act. They all feel that there is no one to listen. In such a society, Mr. Fan insists on speaking tirelessly and enthusiastically broadcasting his sound piece. Under this feeling, I have no time to be sad for Mr. Fan, but instead want to cry bitterly for society.</p>
<p>Despite the stubbornness of society, despite the immaturity of society, Mr. Fan also clearly understands that the Chinese people are difficult to awaken, and also clearly understands that hard work yields little success, but he perseveres and is tireless, what is the reason for this? I solemnly declare: this is a manifestation of patriotic enthusiasm, worthy of twelve points of admiration! Chen Men evaluated Confucius and said: "Is it difficult for those who know it cannot be done and do it anyway?" How much pain does this sentence contain!</p>
<h3>Talking about Allergic Reactions (Allergie)</h3>
<p>— Shou Wuqing</p>
<p>Recently, Shanghai Newspapers reported that a doctor injected a local anesthetic and electrocuted a patient with "dian zheng" (epilepsy), and died due to an allergic reaction to Nuofuke Yin (Novocaine brand name). The prosecutor, after insight into medical principles, announced that he was not guilty, and the medical community applauded. Readers may not understand the meaning of allergic reactions in detail. If unfortunately encountering this situation, patients often misunderstand, causing medical disputes, or even resorting to the court, citing the provisions of causing death due to professional negligence, and attaching civil lawsuits for compensation, blaming the doctor, it is necessary to explain special reactions.</p>
<p>Allergy is a specialized medical term, caused by the patient's special constitution, Allergic Constitution. The so-called special constitution is an unusual feeling. Someone has abnormal dynamics under certain circumstances. In other words, without a special constitution, there is no special reaction (or allergic reaction). There are no statistics on special constitutions in medical books, but in fact, at least one or two out of every thousand people have it. This constitution is rich in congenital heredity. From father to son to grandson. From mother to daughter to nephew. However, the milder degrees of special reactions are often not noticed by patients. Such as urticaria (skin) caused by eating vegetables, fish, shrimp, etc. Abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea (gastrointestinal) caused by eating clams, snails, crabs, etc. Chronic seeping eczema caused by drinking human milk and cow's milk (infant milk rash). Other examples include asthma caused by eating chicken eggs, and hay fever caused by smelling pollen (nervous). The special proteins contained in each food stimulate the patient's nerve cells, causing an abnormal reaction.</p>
<p>Drug-induced special reactions are not uncommon. Those who take a small amount of aspirin and produce a large amount of dirty liquid, those who take a small amount of pyrimidine and their temperature drops sharply, those who take quinine and develop red rashes, those who take hormones and develop skin patches, those who take painkillers and feel more severe headaches, those who take a small amount of eye medicine and fall asleep for a long time, those who drink a lot of yellow wine and not only do not get drunk, but become ecstatic. All of these only describe the most minor special reactions. As for serum injections, common allergic reactions are very rapid. Try injecting a small amount of serum directly into the muscle. In an instant, the face swells, the head becomes as big as a bucket, the eyelids and lips swell and are about to burst, the larynx and glottis, all edema, difficulty breathing, suffocation, cyanosis. However, in life-threatening diphtheria, this type of constitution exists. If diphtheria serum is not injected cautiously, it is difficult to achieve a cure. Therefore, nowadays, patients with traumatic obstruction rarely use serum injection therapy except when absolutely necessary. Even the currently popular penicillin and new drugs for lung disease have the potential to cause special reactions in people with special constitutions (such as chills, high fever, vomiting, rashes, etc.). In the past, it was heard that milk muscle injections (shock therapy) caused extremely dangerous special reactions, and injections of amnyding, silver, and vitamin B caused death. All of these were caused by patients having special constitutions and developing special reactions.</p>
<p>In short, allergic reactions are caused by special constitutions. Special constitutions are the body's allergic reaction, and the underdevelopment of the nervous system and abnormal feelings are the underlying causes. This underlying cause cannot be described by quality or quantity, nor can it be tested by sitting cushions, electrometers, chemical methods, etc. Doctors can hardly predict it during hasty clinical visits. However, similar feelings are occasionally discovered unknowingly in daily life. If it has already happened, then treat it immediately. Mild symptoms are not a problem. For severe illnesses that cannot be salvaged, the doctor is not responsible. Unfortunate facts of the past may be seen again in the future, and it is not uncommon to have special reactions from a medical perspective.</p>
<h3>Hydrophobia</h3>
<p>— Chen Yuan</p>
<p>Hydrophobia is another name for rabies. In recent years, various medical publications and magazines have discussed it a lot. Now I will discuss the name of the disease, and I think it will not be considered superfluous. That is, first, why is "rabies" also called "hydrophobia"? In fact, there are many precedents for one disease with two names! For example, malaria, isn't it also called intermittent fever? The name malaria belongs to the traditional original name, while intermittent fever refers to one of its characteristics, named entirely with symptoms. Because everyone agrees with it, the two names are used together to this day. By analogy, the meaning of hydrophobia and rabies is the same. Rabies can be called the traditional name, while hydrophobia can be called the symptomatic name. This is because the most noticeable and earliest symptom shown by rabies patients, especially unique to humans after contracting rabies but not present in diseased dogs or diseased cats, is this hydrophobia phenomenon. Speaking of symptomatic naming, it is convenient for people to understand the meaning of the words, and to understand the disease naturally when they see the name. Let's talk about malaria first; its fever has a temporal nature. There is fever on the day of onset, and no fever on the day of rest. Because there is a certain period of time between the first fever and the subsequent fever, it is also called tertian fever for those that recur every other day, and quartan fever for those that recur every two days. It is truly descriptive and makes people very alert. Now, using hydrophobia to describe people with rabies is the same. Because patients in the onset of the disease must cause spasms of the pharyngeal muscles when they see any liquid. Not only can they not swallow this liquid and send it to the esophagus, but the shape is extremely painful, as if the liquid is something the patient fears. However, how can the environment be far away from liquids? Especially water, which is indispensable for life; how is it possible to keep the patient from approaching water? Therefore, patients with rabies must have symptoms of hydrophobia, which is discovered by people. Just give it another name, call it hydrophobia, and everyone thinks it is natural. In fact, hydrophobia symptoms are just a phenomenon of difficulty swallowing for ordinary patients! The difference is that ordinary sore throats still can barely drink liquids at first. It is not until the illness is severe that they cannot swallow liquids. Hydrophobia, on the other hand, cannot drink water from the beginning. And at the beginning of the illness, all solid foods may still be swallowed; the more they see liquids, the more difficult it becomes. Especially when taking medicine, it is most embarrassing. Many patients are discovered to have hydrophobia because of difficulty drinking medicine!</p>
<p>Second, hydrophobia symptoms are a characteristic of rabies patients. In ancient China, no one proposed it and discussed it. Turning over ancient books, there are few specific records, which is really unbelievable. On the contrary, there are absurd and unreliable fallacies circulating in society. Especially in the mouths of village old women, there are many superstitions. For example, saying "after a person is bitten by a mad dog, a puppy is born in the abdomen" is still deeply rooted in people's hearts. In this way, in all levels of society, misrepresentation is spread, which really makes people unable to understand! From the point of view of common sense, it is a joke that humans can have dog fetuses. Even among dogs of the same race, why do the male and female mate without using the reproductive organs? There is no reason to become pregnant due to biting with teeth. This absurd fabrication, I don't know who it started from? But no one has ever come out to doubt it; but no one has ever confirmed it, which shows that there are all followers in society. Therefore, it can be thought that the observation power of the ancients was very weak. Rabies can indeed be said to be a terminal illness, and everyone should have observed it in detail and investigated it long ago. If the ancients could pay attention in a comprehensive way, then symptoms such as hydrophobia should have been discovered long ago, so why turn a blind eye? But now the most obvious and unique characteristics have been ignored, isn't it regrettable! As the author speculates, this is entirely the confusion of the ancients. Because hydrophobia symptoms are already expressed in the early stage of the patient, when the mind is clear, but the patient's psychology does not have the self-awareness of fear of water. Because the patient does not recognize that water is a long thing, so bystanders do not take it seriously. Later, as the illness worsened, not only would seeing water cause spasms of the pharyngeal muscles; at the same time, the chewing muscles would also spasm. Therefore, although the patient cannot eat or drink; on the outside, they can see unconscious actions such as empty swallowing and empty chewing. Further, it is also possible to discover abnormal states such as biting bystanders and biting objects. At this time, it is almost similar to the phenomenon of crazy dogs. Everyone is paying attention to the development of its neurological symptoms, and they do not have time to investigate the relationship between hydrophobia and non-hydrophobia!</p>
<p>Third, are hydrophobia symptoms necessarily present in rabies patients? This question, of course, need not be doubted. Anyone suffering from rabies will definitely show this symptom. Because when rabies virus occurs, the first to be affected is the various muscles of the throat. At this time, the nerves in this part are abnormally sensitive. Slight excitement will cause spasm; therefore, food is blocked and difficult to swallow. Especially for drinks, it is especially difficult to swallow. Later, the range of spasms gradually expands, and the chewing muscles; facial muscles; and even the whole body muscles, all spasm. And consciousness gradually disappears, and becomes crazy. However, the illness is still progressing, and finally it becomes paralysis. For a while, it seems that the madness is reduced, and the disease has improved. The spasms of each part stop; the swallowing action is not difficult, and they can slightly swallow some liquid, and their mind and spirit are also much settled. But good times don't last long, and soon the whole body enters a state of paralysis; therefore, the heart and breathing stop together, and in the end, they cannot be saved. It has not been heard that anyone can escape death. However, in fact, there are also a few patients who enter a state of paralysis as soon as they get sick. Any spasm phenomenon has not been expressed, and they have already lost their lives. This is of course an extremely serious case; and the lightning strike type of other infectious diseases; is somewhat similar?</p>
<h3>Physiological Hygiene of the Five Sensory Organs (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Bai Ding</p>
<p>(2) Eye Hygiene: The eyes are for seeing things. The importance of the eyes to the body as a whole is even greater than that of the ears. Without this pair of round eyes, we would not be able to see anything; we would be blind. Even with eyes, if their tissues or functions are impaired or damaged, our vision will be reduced or lost altogether. Now, let me write a few tips on how to protect your eyes hygienically.</p>
<p>1.  Eyes should be protected to prevent external dust and smoke from blowing into them. If they do get into the eyes, take immediate steps to remove them. When removing them, do not rub with your hands, so as not to damage the cornea of the eyeball. Instead, close your eyes temporarily and let the tears flow out. Foreign objects such as dust and smoke will then be washed out with the tears. If this doesn't work, turn the eyelid upwards and gently remove the foreign object with clean cotton or a brush.</p>
<p>2.  On hot summer days, avoid opening your eyes too wide in strong sunlight, or wear colored sunglasses to protect your eyes from strong light. Do not go suddenly from a dark place to a bright place.</p>
<p>3.  Each person should have their own towel and washcloth to prevent the spread of trachoma (please refer to my article "How to Prevent Trachoma").</p>
<p>4.  Get enough sleep and avoid insomnia. Both short sleep duration and sleepless insomnia can impair the eyes. These are a few hygienic methods for protecting the eyes.</p>
<p>(3) Nose Hygiene: Because the nose controls smell, it can also be called the hygiene of the sense of smell. It is also quite important, and yet often overlooked by most people. Now, I will list a few hygienic rules concerning this.</p>
<p>1.  It is not advisable to smell strong fragrances or odors for too long, as prolonged exposure can numb the olfactory nerves and impair their normal function.</p>
<p>2.  Excessive cigarette smoking should be avoided, as it can dull the sense of smell.</p>
<p>3.  Avoid sudden transitions from cold to hot places, or from excessively hot places to excessively cold places, as this can cause nasal congestion, and even lead to colds and other illnesses.</p>
<p>4.  Do not shave your nose hairs during haircuts, as they serve as a natural protector for the nose, blocking foreign objects from entering directly and regulating the temperature of the air during breathing.</p>
<p>5.  On days when the air is dry, wipe the inside of the nasal cavity with a damp cloth or warm water.</p>
<p>6.  If the nose is accidentally injured and bleeds, take steps to stop it. There are two methods: (1) A passive method: insert a soft piece of paper or cotton into the nostril. At the same time, lie with your head tilted back and place a cold, wet towel on your forehead; (2) An active method: pour cold water into the nasal cavity to gradually constrict the blood vessels, which will stop the bleeding on its own. If it does not stop, seek medical attention immediately to avoid delay.</p>
<p>(4) Hygiene of the Tongue: This small piece of tongue also requires a discussion of its hygiene. The hygiene of the tongue refers to how to protect the taste function of the tongue. I will list a few points as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Extremely cold or hot food and beverages can impair taste, so pay attention to this first.</p>
<p>2.  Be careful not to bite your tongue while chewing, as this can spoil your enjoyment of food.</p>
<p>3.  Excessive smoking and drinking can dull the sense of taste. Young friends who love smoking and drinking should take note.</p>
<p>4.  Favoring one particular flavor in food can easily lead to habituation and dull the sense of taste.</p>
<p>5.  When there is a coating on the tongue, it is often difficult to distinguish the taste of food. Apart from illness, working or engaging in nighttime entertainment often leads to a coated tongue. Mahjong enthusiasts should pay attention to this.</p>
<p>(5) Hygiene of the Skin: This was previously mentioned in the section on excretory hygiene, so please refer to the above article. However, people in certain occupations should pay attention to the skin or sensory function used for touch. For example, doctors can examine the condition of internal organs by palpating through the skin and muscles. In entertainment, people who enjoy mahjong often use their fingertips to feel for certain tiles.</p>
<h3>Personnel and Treatment in the Public Health Sector</h3>
<p>— Yu Zhengxing</p>
<p>Some people say, "In China, things are set up according to the person, while in foreign countries, people are used according to the task." It can be seen that Chinese society is centered on personnel. In Chinese administration, the focus is on whether the relationships between people are harmonious, rather than on whether the institutions are closely connected. Therefore, the success or failure of an undertaking depends on the "person," not on the organization, plan, or method. Naturally, "the government thrives when the person is present, and the government ceases when the person is gone" has been regarded as a classic!</p>
<p>In Chinese society, there are not only factions, but also cliques within factions, and subgroups within cliques. When faction A gains power, faction B is abandoned. When faction B comes to power, faction A is dismissed. Therefore, "when one person gains power, ten thousand people enjoy blessings." The existence of this phenomenon only intensifies mutual suspicion and contradictions, and cancels out strength. It only deepens the decay of matters and provides no benefit. This should be broken.</p>
<p>We often find that the same people receive different treatment. In the same area, one may be ranked high in organization A, but the opposite may be true in organization B. Naturally, it is even more different in different places. The difference between local and central governments is often quite large. Of course, this is a method of encouraging advancement in local work, but the excessive difference in ranks can disrupt the personnel system. I also agree with rewarding those who have worked in local areas for a long time, but I oppose destroying the integrity of a system. In particular, the treatment enjoyed by many people who use factional relationships or nepotism is different. This is despised by those with aspirations and considered shameful by those with blood!</p>
<p>In the entire public health sector, the issue of treatment shows inequality. In fact, the general treatment is already low, which is undeniable. However, some receive an additional 30% or 50% based on the salary standard, while others receive nothing at all. We also see that within the same organization, some are given increases due to different work departments. This unequal treatment, displayed before our eyes, will inevitably stimulate work emotions and affect work efficiency. At the very least, it will be believed that the public health sector is either corrupt or bureaucratic. The hopelessness of the future is evident.</p>
<p>Having drafted this, based on my limited views, I make the following suggestions:</p>
<p>1.  Value Talent and Do Not Rely on Factions: Now I would like to quote Mr. Hu Dingan's words, which I believe have already been seen. Scholarship has no national boundaries, and truth has no two paths. Those engaged in academic work must first have a broad mind and a humble heart, eliminate personal feelings, and choose with an open mind. As the saying goes, "White can be accepted and adopted, and sweet can be accepted and harmonized." Moreover, given the current situation in our country, with so few medical talents, such a great social need, such urgent suffering of the people awaiting relief, and such a thirst for medical academic knowledge, we should unite our strength and focus our will. Among colleagues, we must not have a sense of superiority or narrow-minded views. We should have fairness and integrity, and reasonable strategies to reduce the childish behavior of currying favor with those in power, and increase the friendly emotions of being kind and approachable. We should uphold the spirit of "scholarship deepens when temper is calm," widely connect, and sweep away the previous factional concepts and prejudices for the sake of medical scholarship. Now is the time to show the bright attitude of "clouds disappearing and smoke scattering, the sun rising and the sky becoming clear," the so-called "all under heaven are one family." We should select the virtuous and employ the capable, so that people can be matched with appropriate tasks, and tasks are suitable for people. This should be the strategy for employing people in the future, and we can no longer repeat the past, with uneven work and leisure, and unbalanced power, which hindered the progress of undertakings.</p>
<p>2.  Establish a New Personnel System: The foundation for selecting the virtuous and employing the capable lies in knowing people well and making good use of them, and using people in a fair and reasonable manner. Today, putting the word "private" at the beginning has led to the advancement of petty people and the alienation of the virtuous. In the medical and public health sector, it is necessary to establish good discipline in the future, and the personnel system must be rebuilt. On the one hand, their professions should be guaranteed, and on the other hand, their functions should be defined. So that a technical person will not be rejected in their work due to personal feelings. In terms of treatment, if a certain treatment can be enjoyed in place A, the same treatment should be available in place B, without the situation of place A being too high and place B being too low. At the same time, we should prevent opportunistic people from finding opportunities and seeking luck. Whether it is central or local, all should be equal, with no special cases. Naturally, giving special subsidies and allowances to those who work in local areas should be considered separately. However, its basic principles should not be allowed to be shaken, and should be consistent throughout the country, without further divergence.</p>
<p>3.  Encourage Young Talents: Many people see themselves as loving, cultivating, and promoting young people, but in reality, they are the least understanding of young people, and even use and destroy them. As a result, many young people become disheartened. Many young people with ideals and hopes, who are kind-hearted, are unfortunately tortured, and become "prematurely mature" with a gray attitude, abandoning hope, giving up ideals, drifting with the tide, and following the old ways. We believe that this is not only the misfortune of the young people themselves, but also the misfortune of society and the misfortune of undertakings. Therefore, for a new young person, if they are recognized as having potential, creativity, and a future, they must be taught, supported, and molded, so that they become people with hope and greater achievements. A person's age is limited, and in the process of transition between the old and the new, the continuation of undertakings and the discovery of ideals must rely on the efforts of young people. Therefore, cultivating young talents is necessary, and this is the only way to have hope for the future of China's medical and public health undertakings.</p>
<p>4.  Improve the Treatment of Medical Personnel: "Not starving to death, not eating enough, not freezing to death, not wearing warm clothes" has become a common saying among public servants. However, those with many children are in danger of starving and freezing to death. Five months ago, a doctor who graduated in 1942 expressed his willingness to serve the country's public health work, regardless of remuneration or position, but could not fully devote himself to public service. This is because he can earn 4 million yuan a month by practicing for three hours a day. This shows that the treatment of technical personnel is too low, and daily life cannot be maintained. Even if they are willing to serve the government, for the sake of "life," they cannot but seek their own way out and plan to practice privately. Therefore, I hope that the government will reward technical personnel generously. "You can't expect a horse to run fast without feeding it." If a technical person is worried about food, clothing, and housing, how can he have the mind to research, invent, or treat patients with peace of mind? It is simply a pipe dream. An enlightened administrative authority should ensure that these medical and public health technical personnel have a stable life, so that they can work hard for their careers with peace of mind. At the same time, only in this way can outstanding talents be recruited. In the future, when the public medical system is implemented, managing private practice and banning private practice without improving treatment will probably still fail. Quickly improve and stabilize the lives of medical personnel!</p>
<p>"Employing one capable person is better than employing ten rice-eaters." In order to pursue work efficiency and hope for the development of undertakings, whether in terms of personnel or treatment, it is more beneficial to obtain a capable talent at a high price than a "cheap" fool. Therefore, in the future, in terms of personnel, we should not only select the virtuous and employ the capable, reward the good and punish the bad, but also cultivate capable talents and recruit capable talents. Whether in terms of systems, facilities, or treatment, we should provide convenience for capable talents. If we value talent in this way, the people will be motivated, seek practicality, and not be fond of false fame, and there will naturally be hope for building undertakings.</p>
<p>Some may think that what I have discussed above is a problem of the entire Chinese society, and not just the medical and public health sector. If the entire society is not improved, single-sided efforts may have little hope. I believe that this is the prevailing thought of "following the old ways," and this is the idea of being birds of a feather flocking together. If the medical and public health sector, as an academic and professional group, does not first correct itself as a demonstration, and uses the entire society as an excuse, it really shows that it is not making progress. And this lack of progress, existing in academic and professional groups, is shameful!</p>
<p>In order to pave a smooth road for the implementation of the public medical system, it is right and proper to demand the rationalization of the personnel system and to demand the improvement of the treatment of medical personnel. Government authorities who care about the health of the nation, legislators who pay attention to the prosperity of the country, pay attention, pay attention to improvement!</p>

<h3>Wang Tao, the "状元 of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" and His Works</h3>
<p>— Shen Dingjun</p>
<p>Formerly Collected the Juju Zhenban Series for This Newspaper</p>
<p>Wang Tao, originally named Wan, styled Libin, sobriquet Lanjun, also known as Lanqing, and Ziju. Later, in his autobiography, he also said that his original name was Libin, which was changed to Han, styled Lanjin. He was from Changzhou, Wu, and his family lived in Fuli. He sat for the imperial examination but was registered in Xinyang. Therefore, in the records of Kunxin Qingying, there is Wang Han's inscription. After his letter to the Taiping army was discovered, he changed his name to Tao, styled Ziquan (also written as Quan), sobriquet Zhongtao, and in his later years he retired to Guangdong, calling himself the Hermit of Tiannan. He was born in the eighth year of the Qing Dynasty's Daoguang reign (1828 AD) and died in the sixteenth year of the Guangxu reign (1890 AD), at the age of sixty-three. His father's name was Xixian, sobriquet Youzhi, who was also a Xinyang graduate. His mother, Zhu, gave birth to two sons and one daughter, with Tao being the second son. His sister married into a certain Wu family in Wujun, and his younger brother's name was Guiqing, who died young, leaving a widow and an orphan. Wang Tao's first wife was Yang, styled Mengheng, and his second wife was Lin. After marrying Wang Tao, Tao renamed her Huaiheng to show that he did not forget his first wife. Yang was the daughter of the local Lian Caiting and the sister of the talent Xintuan. This relationship between Wang and Yang is not known in detail even by the Yang descendants today. Tao had only one daughter and no son. His daughter married into the Qian family of Wucheng, and later made his daughter's son his grandson, calling him Youquan.</p>
<p>In his youth, he truly suffered from poverty and illness. All the expenses for medicine and other things were provided by his mother's pawning of belongings and diligent spinning. He was very fond of books and studied together with his fellow villager Xu Qi (styled Renhu) under the tutelage of Jinxi Di Mingjing. (There is the Chaoshi Poetry Collection, also by a fellow villager, who happened to be residing in Jinxi. Jinxi is another name for Chenmu.) Tao was unrestrained in nature and looked down on everything. At the age of twenty-two, he suffered the loss of his father, and his family became even poorer. He went to Shanghai alone and served at the Mohai Printing Bureau run by the Englishman Walter Henry Medhurst, holding a very low position, and spent several years in depression.</p>
<p>In his nineteenth year, Wang Tao failed the Jinling examination and abandoned writing exam essays, resolving to study the classics and history. However, he enjoyed wandering and, while sitting for the examination in Jinling, he became acquainted with two schoolmistresses, Ren Suqin and Miao Aixiang. When he saw the famous courtesans He Xiang and Suqing on the Huai River, he was also fascinated. In the preface to his self-edited "Anecdotes of Romance," he also said, "When I was young, I liked to write oblique sentences, and I was proficient as soon as I put pen to paper." In his "Heng Hua Guan Poetry Record," there is a dream poem with the line, "The blue courtyard and red walls were originally close, but coming again may not be separated from the human world." And he wrote of excitement, "New thin gauze is still afraid of heat, secretly wiping fragrant sweat to avoid strangers." These two poems are very charming. In his twenty-fourth year, his pleasure trips became even more frequent, with flower selections and song invitations every day, and his unrestrained reputation became known for a time. In the preface to his "Record of Leisurely Travels in Hai Zou," he also said, "In the spring of Xinhai (the ninth year of Xianfeng), I engaged in some pleasure trips, and my unrestrained reputation suddenly became known. I selected flowers, opened wine, invited songs, and tapped the beat. I wrote articles on skirts and asked for fans, and I was indifferent to transmission. Therefore, the clinging catkins became duckweed drifting with the water." After reading the above poems and articles, one can see his tender feelings and thoughts.</p>
<p>Wang Tao was very depressed when he failed the examination in his early years. Moreover, with the corruption of the Qing government and the growing momentum of the Taiping army, he used the name "Huang Wan" in the first year of Tongzhi to write a letter to Li Xiucheng, the loyal king of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, advising him to make peace with foreign countries and use foreign forces to conquer the Central Plains, and offering a plan to seize Shanghai. Unfortunately, the loyal king did not adopt it, but from then on, there was a misrepresentation of Wang Tao as the "状元 of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." Later, the book he submitted was obtained when the Qing army broke through the seven fortresses, and he was ordered to be arrested. He escaped to Shanghai and received the protection of the Westerner Walter Henry Medhurst. He responded to the call of his Western friend James Legge and, in August of that year, took his family to Guangdong, and later lived in Hong Kong for two years. In the sixth year of Tongzhi, he traveled with his Western friend James Legge to Scotland in England to translate and revise Chinese classics. Later, he traveled to various Western countries and was welcomed by people there. He returned to China in the ninth year of Tongzhi and still hid in Hong Kong, not daring to return home. In the twelfth year of Tongzhi, the Hong Kong "Circulation Daily" was founded, and he served as its editor. In the fifth year of Guangxu, he traveled to Japan and had close contact with Japanese literati. In the eighth year of Guangxu, he returned to Shanghai and returned home once to talk with Xu Qi and others about their separation. Two years later, he moved his family from Hong Kong to Shanghai and took the position of editor at the Shen Bao newspaper office, and founded a woodblock movable type printing office in Shanghai, called the Tao Yuan Bookstore. - Xu Qi's "Xing Hu She Diao Tan" was printed with the bookstore's woodblock movable type. In the thirteenth year of Guangxu, he was already sixty years old and served as the head of the Shanghai Gezhi Academy. He reversed the previous academy's practice of teaching scholars with classics and history and instead taught people to focus on science, hoping to store materials for the country and turn the weak Qing court into a strong one.</p>
<p>In his later years, Wang Tao saw that the world was becoming more and more wrong, so he devoted himself to writing. If we flip through the "Literary Examination" of the Wuxian Chronicle, we will see that Wang Tao's records are about thirty or more kinds, more than 370 volumes. Not only can it be said that his writings are as tall as his body, but he is also knowledgeable in both Chinese and Western cultures. The books he wrote are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Sixty volumes of "Collected Explanations of the Spring and Autumn Zuo Tradition," three volumes of "Examination of the Spring and Autumn Shuo Wang and Months," one volume of "Discrimination and Correction of the Spring and Autumn Solar Eclipse," one volume of "Spring and Autumn Shuo Wang Table," twenty-four volumes of "Collated Notes on the Imperial Qing Classic Explanations," one hundred and twenty volumes of "Four Ming Supplements," eight volumes of "National Dynasty Classic Records" (also written as twelve volumes), one volume of "Brief Records of China-England Trade," three volumes of "Taiwan Affairs Secret Anger Records" (also written as four volumes), six volumes of "Ying Yuan Miscellaneous Records," twenty volumes of "Re-edited Record of the Franco-Prussian War," twelve volumes of "Record of the North and South American War," four volumes of "Western Ancient History," four volumes of "Western Affairs," twelve volumes of "Re-edited French Strategy" (also written as twenty-four volumes), six volumes of "Record of Travel to Japan" (also written as three volumes), eight volumes of "Random Notes on Wandering" (with illustrations), twelve volumes of "Song Yin Miscellaneous Records" (with illustrations), eight volumes of "Yu Yong Yu Tan," twelve volumes of "Dunku Jiangyan," one volume of "Lao Xiang Zhui Yu," one volume of "Elementary Explanation of Heavy Learning," three volumes of "Firearm Flow," one volume of "Origin of Western Astronomy," one volume of "Optical Illustration," one volume of "Outline of the New Learning of Gewu," one volume of "Examination of Western Works," six volumes of "Heng Hua Guan Poetry," four volumes of "Mei Zhu Ci Chao," eight volumes of "Tao Yuan Chi Du Xu Chao," twelve volumes of "Tao Yuan Chi Du," twelve volumes of "Tao Yuan Wenlu Wai Bian."</p>
<p>In addition, the National Beiping Library has seven volumes of Wang Tao's handwritten books, including Eastern Travel Draft Records and Hua Guan Diary, and fragments of reading notes. (See Beiping Wax Museum Journal) Of the above books, I have only seen a few. And in the preface to his Huayang San Gao, written in the ninth year of Guangxu, he said: "A fire last year reduced half of my life's writings to ashes." Judging from this, Wang Tao's works must have been lost a lot, and it is difficult to grasp the whole picture.</p>
<p>Looking at Wang Tao's life as a whole, although he was poor in his youth, lived in exile in middle age, and was frail in his old age, he was unable to develop his ambitions and died with regret. However, the friends he made were all famous figures at home and abroad. Wherever his footprints went, except for the New World, there were traces of him. Moreover, his writings were so rich that he was truly admirable. He was truly a strange figure of his generation! In his personal life, although he enjoyed pleasure trips, he strongly opposed concubinage to continue the family line and advocated the system of one husband and one wife. He also despised the stereotypical essays of the imperial examination, although he may have felt this way because he failed the examination. However, in view of the daily decline of national affairs and the uselessness of exam essays, he dared to publicly oppose the career that the whole country regarded as a path to advancement, which also shows his extraordinary courage and knowledge. However, after his letter to the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was exposed, he still repeatedly defended himself, hoping for something, which was a bit too enthusiastic about fame and profit.</p>
<p>Wang Tao once collected the Juju Zhenban Series for this newspaper. In the preface to his "Dun Ku Yan," he said:</p>
<p>"In the year Yihai, the owner of Zunwen Pavilion had the ambition to collect books of strange records, and sought me out. I returned to Yixiepu, and made friends with those overseas. I traveled to the Pearl River, and selected from them directly."</p>
<p>Yihai was the first year of the Qing Dynasty's Guangxu reign. Since he said "traveled to the Pearl River," it is thought that his traces were still in Lingfu. This is a self-description, so it should be reliable history. The rest are not recorded in the literature. (This Newspaper Data Room)</p>
<h3>On Literary Criticism</h3>
<p>— Hu Guangdong</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>In a Chinese society that is poor in literary works, literary criticism, which is the task of promoting the content of literary works, also appears desolate. The problem with current literary criticism is the lack of critical spirit, in other words, the attitude of critics is not objective enough and not enthusiastic enough.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Lu Xun once said, "What we need are solid, clear, and truly knowledgeable critics of social science and literary theory." Indeed, if a literary critic lacks a knowledge of social science and does not understand the social life factors in literary works, then I can guarantee that his excavation work will be low-energy and slow.</p>
<p>The conditions that a critic must possess are a service-oriented outlook on life and a scientific worldview. This can be said to be the weapon of criticism and the measuring instrument of truth.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>Creators are workers, and critics are mentors. This so-called mentor is not a pedantic old gentleman whose enthusiasm has waned, but a person who possesses rich knowledge and enthusiasm. With his strength, he can point out the direction that literary workers should take.</p>
<p>Excavating the value of the works of warriors can be said to be the main task of critics. Shi Nai'an's "Water Margin," Cao Xueqin's "Dream of the Red Chamber," Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q," Goethe's "Faust," Gorky's "Mother," etc., these works were able to become immortal works in the minds of the people because they were the result of repeated criticism by critics. It can also be said that this is the result of the critics' excavation.</p>
<p>Critics are sensitive to the general readers.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>Those who talk about means cannot become critics because criticism is never about praising to the heavens or suppressing to the depths, but about extremely fair and serious analysis.</p>
<p>Criticism has depth. Superficial criticism, merely scratching the surface, is worth zero in terms of value. Critics stand on the basis of scientific and objective judgment and radiate unparalleled heat and emotion towards literary works.</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>In a stagnant society, we look forward to the emergence of good works and solid, objective literary criticism.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Writings from a Waterside Village in Early Summer</h3>
<p>— Jiang Ye</p>
<p>Pond</p>
<p>A small pond, a sparkling pond, a lovely green pond. —</p>
<p>In recent days, this pond has become so beautiful, so charming. This pond has become so beautiful and so charming with the changing seasons and the arrival of the vigorous and abundant summer.</p>
<p>The small bushes on the edge of the pond cover it with a dense, cool, green shade. The green duckweed blooms with small white flowers, sparsely scattered throughout the pond. Newborn fish come to the surface in groups to frolic, without any concern. At dawn and dusk, this pond is even more the arena of the good singing frogs, broadcasting enthusiastic summer hymns. ...</p>
<p>I say that the pond is an elegant little window of the season. In the time of the arrival of this vigorous and abundant summer, the pond is full of life, full of color and sound.</p>
<p>Lake</p>
<p>The lake is the eye of the earth, the mirror of the universe.</p>
<p>The lake in early summer is full of green water. The lake light in early summer is so bright that it is hard to open your eyes.</p>
<p>The lake has an open and cheerful mind that can contain everything:</p>
<p>A mountain, a corner pavilion, a cloud, a sail, a flying bird, a falling sunset, can all cast their traces here for a while or a long time.</p>
<p>The people who live by the lake love the lake; the lake also loves these people who live near it.</p>
<p>The lake reflects the lives of the people by the lake: content with poverty and happy with the Way. The fate of the lake and the people by the lake are tied together.</p>
<h3>Swallows Fly in Pairs</h3>
<p>— Xie Caiqin</p>
<h3>Small Courtyard</h3>
<p>— Xuan Jianren</p>
<p>In the small courtyard, some flowers are planted. I can't quite name them, but their colors are red, yellow, purple, white... competing for beauty. Butterflies and dragonflies fly around, making the small courtyard lively. The walnut tree from the neighbor's yard leans over, its leaves lush and green, with young green fruits hanging on the branches, three or two... so endearing.</p>
<p>In the morning, I look at the flowers; each flower has glistening dewdrops. Flowers bloom and wither; isn't life also like this? They say flowers can understand language; can they understand my melancholy? At night, I enjoy the cool breeze in the small courtyard. The chirping of insects in the corner of the wall reminds me of the troubles of life. I think of a string of lost colorful dreams, and I sigh.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I look up to see a sky full of stars.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 333</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>It turns out that at this time, the American intelligence department had discovered that this dock worker was actually the third prince of Germany, a valuable asset. Exchanging him for four high-ranking military officers was worthwhile, and the German side was very flexible, even willing to add further incentives. However, the American intelligence department had other plans. They weren't concerned about the additional incentives but demanded that Germany first hand over the four captured generals to the Swiss Foreign Ministry for safekeeping. Secretly, they also made arrangements to secretly assign a top-notch spy, disguised as a low-ranking officer who didn't understand a word of German, to sneakily release the third prince from prison. The condition was to escort the third prince back to Germany, in exchange for a reward and a military rank.</p>
<p>At that time, Germany's spy network in the United States was quite extensive. As long as he could get out of prison, escaping back to Germany wouldn't be a problem. Furthermore, the American intelligence department provided special assistance, allowing them to steal a small airplane to fly to Mexico, and then take a train to Brazil in South America. Once in Brazil, a German submarine would be waiting to take them back home.</p>
<p>Why did the American intelligence department do this? The reason was to easily send this top-notch spy to Germany, disguised as the third prince's savior. From then on, the American spy lurking in Berlin had a new force to rely on and could even access the heavily guarded German military headquarters. (This is also a single-line operation).</p>
<p>The reason for mentioning this episode is to explain that when a special-class spy "single-line" operative appears, there must be a fixed posture. For example, the German third prince appears in a low-level social role, such as a dock worker, changing his name and hiding among the dock workers. However, in the German high-level spy headquarters' records, there must be a file for this third prince, with a note. This file and note, apart from the minister in charge of spies, for the sake of strict secrecy and the safety of the spy, internal secrets, no one can know, only the headquarters' single line, directly connected abroad. As for the spy dispatched by the United States, he appears as a military traitor. Only the highest authority and the minister know about this. Although the scandalous news of this traitor spread like wildfire, it was merely a smokescreen.</p>
<p>But it should be understood that the actions and procedures for sending out spies in this way are relatively simple; however, if something goes wrong and rescue is needed, how is this secret instruction conveyed? Outsiders, looking at it from the perspective of movies and novels, think that using wireless code or other means of communication to deliver the instruction to the location of the incident abroad is a success. However, in reality, there are no such convenient and simple things. Moreover, military procedures are extremely complex, and spy operations and instruction delivery are even more complex than military ones.</p>
<p>There are, of course, pre-arranged methods for delivering instructions, which we won't discuss. But what is the actual form of the instruction? The first point is naturally the code. Is this code so easy to use? First, it must be subtle; second, it must be clear and definite; and third, it must be brief. These three conditions are troublesome enough. The only way to meet these three conditions is to use a substitute name method, just like algebra uses ABC and XY.</p>

<h3>American Independence Day</h3>
<p>— Shilang</p>
<p>Today is American Independence Day, and we would like to use this short article to express our congratulations.</p>
<p>The American people freed themselves from the shackles of their nation and, with perseverance, defeated the British and declared independence. Now, there are one hundred and seventy-one years of history.</p>
<p>The American people—this glorious nation—deserve admiration for their boldness and straightforwardness; they never fear hardship, and they never bow their heads to obstacles. In the Second World War, thanks to its uniquely favorable environment and abundant resources, America today is leading the way, guiding the nations of the world toward freedom and peace.</p>
<p>But the whole world now has a kind of anxiety, thinking that the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union is inevitable, and that a third, more cruel, and more cold-blooded world war will definitely break out. With the current intense gunpowder atmosphere in the international arena, and the sharp exchanges in the diplomatic maneuvering between the United States and the Soviet Union, the strong wording gives every nerve ending in the world a terrible premonition:</p>
<p>"War is unavoidable!"</p>
<p>Every chess piece, every step, and every angle reveals the tense stance between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Has the color of war really formed? Must the soldiers who have just washed away the blood from the trenches and suffered physical and mental trauma cross another battlefield?</p>
<p>This seems too cruel. In order to maintain the progress of the world and human culture, the American people and their wise leaders have a heavy responsibility to remove the smog-filled barriers before them!</p>
<p>Free Discussion</p>
<h3>Confucius's Teachings Are Not Outdated</h3>
<p>— Jin Changkang</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Lu Xun's article "Duke Zhou and Confucius" a few days ago, I was filled with sympathy. We see that the troubles and disasters of the world today are caused by a lack of respect for Confucianism and a lack of understanding of the Confucian classics. This is a fact, not outdated thinking. Why? Because Confucius shouted for human justice!</p>
<p>Basing his teachings on the truth of the Three Powers (Heaven, Earth, and Man), he established classics and teachings, and formulated the great laws for governing the world, not just to pass on his own writings. It should be known that there is only one truth in the world. Because it is the truth, and because there is only one, it has no temporal, racial, or regional limitations. Therefore, Confucius's classics and teachings are so vast that the world cannot contain them, and so small that the world cannot break them. They are accurate wherever they are applied, stand upright between heaven and earth, and can be a model for all ages. That is their meaning.</p>
<p>We must also recognize that Confucius's teachings are to teach people to follow the truth of humanity, to promote human progress, and to create a world of great harmony and peace, with absolutely no outdated elements. The "Zhong Yong" (Doctrine of the Mean) says: "Confucius said: To like to act on one's own opinions, and to be fond of taking one's own way without advice, though one may be of low station and mean employment, will bring calamity upon one's self." How thoroughly he speaks! But since the time of Confucius until now, this world has been circulating and killing each other, progressing from a local to a global scale. The science of killing has progressed from ignorance to the point of almost destroying the entire world. This evolution of humans devouring each other is all caused by selfishness and self-reliance. It is even more savage than the primitive barbarism, destroying the path of human justice and opening up the demonic path of advancing in name but retreating in reality, and a lack of rational progression. All this is not allowed by Confucius's classics and teachings, so they are demoted to the ranks of the foolish and contemptible. The so-called "To be born in the present age and turn back to the ways of the ancients; such a course will bring calamity upon oneself" is Confucius's theory of evolution. The main point is to teach people not to drive backwards. However, Confucius taught people not to drive backwards, with standards and without blind following. So he does not use the words new and old to make judgments of right and wrong. Therefore, he said, "Review the old and know the new." Only in this way will one not obliterate the truth because of the new.</p>
<h3>Summer Night—Talking About Fireflies</h3>
<p>— Yiren</p>
<p>At night, I was enjoying the cool breeze in the garden with my children. Fireflies flew by, flashing their light. The children eagerly used their fans to swat at them, catching many and putting them in a bottle to play with.</p>
<p>The older child, who loves to read, told his younger sisters the story of Che Yin reading by fireflies. They didn't believe it, saying, "How can such a small light from a firefly be used to read?" The older child said, "If you gather enough of them, just like the ancients said, 'A gathering of mosquitoes can become thunder,' then we can also gather fireflies to become electricity." Hearing this new idiom, "gather fireflies to become electricity," I couldn't help but laugh, thinking that his two years in high school hadn't been in vain. A little girl, who was in the fifth grade of elementary school, pestered me to tell her a story about fireflies too.</p>
<p>I suddenly remembered Yuan Shikai's strange act with fireflies, so I said to them, "The story I'm going to tell is the opposite of what your brother told you. When Yuan Shikai was young, he was most afraid of studying. The teacher beat him, and he hated the teacher, so he secretly planned to harm him. One night, he waited by the side of the road that the teacher had to pass on his way home. The grass by the road was very deep, hiding his small body. A few days before, he had stored a whole bottle of fireflies. At this time, he poured them all out, rubbed them with his hands, and then smeared them all over his face, so that his face was covered with flashing firefly light, like a monster with a shining face. When the teacher's footsteps slowly approached from afar, he suddenly jumped out of the bushes, catching the poor teacher off guard, scaring him so much that he fell ill when he got home."</p>
<p>The children laughed for a while, and then scolded Yuan Shikai for being a bad guy. The older child said, "No wonder he wanted to be an emperor and betray the country later. It turns out he was a big villain when he was a child."</p>
<p>"There was another emperor who had an interesting encounter with fireflies, and that was Emperor Yang of Sui. In the summer, he issued an order in Jinghua Palace, requisitioning dozens of bushels of fireflies. As a result, every family in the capital sent people to the countryside to catch them. It took several days to satisfy the emperor's desire. Do you know what Emperor Yang did with these dozens of bushels of fireflies? He took all the flying fireflies to the top of a high mountain and released them all at once, so that tens of thousands of small lights flew all over the mountains and fields. There seemed to be more of them than the stars in the sky. It was really fun!"</p>
<p>"Why was Emperor Yang being playful like a child?" the little girl asked.</p>
<p>"Many ancient emperors were great villains, who loved to waste the strength of the people to satisfy their personal entertainment. Emperor Yang's antics were relatively harmless, but other emperors did many things that were very harmful to the people, which are too numerous to tell. Yuan Shikai's story of using fireflies to scare the teacher is of course extremely hateful. The reason we oppose autocratic emperors is that many of them love to do unreasonable, cruel, and vicious things." I thus reached a small conclusion for the children's firefly stories.</p>
<h3>The Troubles of American Veterans</h3>
<p>— Gongtao</p>
<p>An American veteran wrote a letter to the representative of Indiana, in which he said:</p>
<p>"The army stipulates that after I return home, I can no longer wear my uniform, otherwise I will be considered 'impersonating a soldier.' But the shop assistants tell me that they don't have clothes that fit me, and the policemen say that I can't walk naked on the street, saying it's illegal. I'd also like not to go out, but I can't find a house to live in, and I can't even buy a wooden bucket because of the lack of wood. I was injured, so my physique is not up to standard, and I can't rejoin the army. What can I do!?"</p>
<h3>Thinking of the Good Old Days</h3>
<p>— Hulu</p>
<p>The rise of thieves</p>
<p>Strange news is constantly seen in the newspapers. I once heard of robbers building foreign-style houses; I also heard of thieves contributing good fields; thieves are actually dressed as rich old men!</p>
<p>Excellent brains, kind hearts, it is difficult for this world to avoid hunger! How many empty-handed masters are there, accustomed to cleverly hiding their clothes and hats!</p>
<h3>The Red Hair Country</h3>
<p>— Ji Ming</p>
<p>When Jian Qizi did not mention Wang Yuyang, the "Luan Yang Xia Xia Lu" (Luan Yang Summer Records) all contained stories of the "Red Hair Country," roughly saying that the people of the Red Hair Country were good at sailing and at recognizing treasures. However, they were of a dark and alarming nature, fond of killing and stealing property, so although they repeatedly requested mutual trade, the Chinese court did not permit it. That year, merchants from the Red Hair Country requested from the local officials that they be granted a piece of land to serve as their lodge. The local officials granted it, but when the opened the clothes to view, they had spread several acres of land, the residents relied on translation, and were looted and went. I examined this "Red Hair Country", which is now Portugal. Earlier, in the fourteenth year of Jiajing during the Ming Dynasty, the military commander Huang Qing, due to bribes from the Portuguese, requested that Macau be used as a trading port, marking the beginning of the Portuguese entering Macau for mutual trade. Later, in the thirty-second year of Jiajing, the Portuguese merchants used the excuse that their tribute goods had been flooded and requested land to dry them, thus occupying an increasing amount of land. In the first year of Wanli during the reign of Emperor Shenzong, Macau officials once again accepted bribes from the Portuguese, building a wall at the narrowest point of the Macau Peninsula as a boundary, with the Portuguese paying a rent of five hundred taels, marking the origin of the Portuguese rule over Macau today. What is recorded in the books of Yuan and Wang may be a mistake from the thirty-second year of Jiajing. Both gentlemen considered themselves to be learned Confucians, yet their ignorance of "foreign affairs" is evident here. Today, there have been repeated discussions about the return of Macau, but the Portuguese have procrastinated, and have not been able to grasp the key points. I wonder if the people of the Red Hair Country today are still like those described in the past?</p>
<h3>American Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>Courtesy and Reciprocity in America</p>
<p>Chinese old scholars have a saying, "If etiquette is lost, seek it among the barbarians." Like China, an ancient country with 5,000 years of culture, everyone has read the "Book of Rites" in vain, so that students do not greet their teachers when they see them, and sons do not bow to their fathers. Instead, the Americans' Sir, Daddy, and Honey sound so polite. The "Young man, this way is polite" seen on the Chinese opera stage was originally a tactic for dealing with women, and no one said it to a teacher or father.</p>
<p>Americans value etiquette the most, but they are not exaggerated. They must send greeting cards every season for celebrations and birthdays. These greeting cards cost from five cents to one dollar each. It is a gift but cannot be considered a heavy gift. The Chinese way of giving gifts is different, and there are some banks that cast gold into loquats to send during the Dragon Boat Festival, which has degenerated from etiquette to bribery. The "etiquette" mentioned in the Book of Rites has long been lost, and maybe that "etiquette" has crossed the ocean to America.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of gifts that Chinese people give, including cars and foreign-style houses, American dollars and gold bars, bank gift certificates, and beautiful concubines and beautiful concubines. Gifts from Americans include greeting cards, chocolates, cosmetics, jewelry, and clothing items. Men can buy bras and shorts for their lovers; women can buy pajamas and slippers for their lovers. This kind of gift, at most a few US dollars, is already a very generous gift. Some parents send watches or graduation commemorative rings to their daughters in college, and some send pianos, which is a wealthy style and not very common, but pianos in America cost only three or four hundred dollars, which is only the price of a gold loquat.

<p>Scientific Essays</p>
<h3>Swallowtail Butterfly</h3>
<p>— Jia Zuzhang</p>
<p>"Eyebrows curled like iron wire, wings haloed with golden jade, it comes first to vie with the beauty of flowers, suddenly goes, leaving no trace like a ghost."</p>
<p>Su Shi's poem about the ghost butterfly is about what the "Gu Jin Zhu" (Notes of Antiquity and the Present) calls "having a size as big as a bat, or black, or with blue spots, named Fengzi (Phoenix Child), also named Fengche (Phoenix Chariot), also named Guiche (Ghost Chariot), living in Jiangnan citrus orchards." Now general zoology books call it the swallowtail butterfly, probably derived from the two names Fengzi and Fengche. The "Guihai Chongyu Zhi" (Records of Insects and Fish of Guihai) calls it "Guiren Yun Yuanwu Chan (Ghost Man Cloud Dark Cicada)," which clearly still refers to the swallowtail butterfly.</p>
<p>Now, folklore says it is the incarnation of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai, and there is a tragic love story circulating. Zhu Yingtai was an only daughter. Her parents loved her like a pearl in their palm and treated her like a son. She wore men's clothing and studied in the school, just like Mulan joining the army, and was not recognized. Usually, she had the best relationship with her classmate Liang Shanbo, and over time, love developed, but Liang Shanbo did not know. Later, Zhu Yingtai quit school and returned home, and became ill, troubling her parents to seek medical treatment in various ways, but with no effect. It was not until her condition became critical that Zhu Yingtai revealed her innermost thoughts. When her parents heard this, they hurriedly sent someone to notify Liang Shanbo. However, clouds and mountains blocked the way, and the journey was long. By the time Liang Shanbo arrived, Zhu Yingtai had already passed away. Liang Shanbo, with a sad and guilty heart, went to the grave to mourn, and the grave suddenly cracked open, burying Liang Shanbo. Zhu Yingtai's parents hurriedly hired people to excavate, but they did not find their bodies, only a pair of beautiful butterflies flying out. From then on, they could often be seen flying together on flowers. This story was already recorded in the Ming Dynasty, and can be found in the "Shantang Skao," which says: "It is popularly said that large butterflies must be in pairs, which are the souls of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai. It is also said that the souls of couples can be turned into butterflies, which is all incomprehensible."</p>
<p>As for the story of Han Ping and his wife, it originated earlier than the story of Liang Shanbo and his wife, and is found in the "Sou Shen Ji" (Records of Searching for Spirits), which says: "The Song official Yu Ping married a beautiful woman, but King Kang of Song seized her. Ping committed suicide. His wife secretly rotted her clothes, climbed the stage with the king, and threw herself off the stage. The people on the left and right grabbed her, but their hands turned into trees." It is also said that they turned into mandarin ducks (see my book Birds and Literature). Whether they turn into mandarin ducks or butterflies, they are symbols of deep human feelings.</p>
<p>The swallowtail butterfly is a family of large and beautiful butterflies, with the hind wings extended into tails, generally flying gracefully, like a phoenix, so it is named Fengzi. The larvae are harmful to citrus leaves and are easily found in gardens, relatively close to humans, and easily attract attention.</p>
<p>But such a beautiful and common butterfly, with beautiful names such as Fengzi, has rarely been cited in Chinese literature. According to the "Wenchang Zalu," only Han Hen's poems have used the word Fengzi. The poem is "Goose sips female yellow mouth, Phoenix child lightly and gracefully paints waist." In just seven characters, the characteristics of the swallowtail butterfly are vividly described.</p>
<p>As for being called the ghost butterfly, it is probably related to the legend that Han Ping or Liang Shanbo and his wife turned into butterflies after their deaths; or because its color is black.</p>
