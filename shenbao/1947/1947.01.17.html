<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕和談今日漸吿定局，政府擬定新方案後，已宣布即派員赴延安，並己於十五日深夜吿知司使，請其轉達中共，今後局勢之如何發展，端視共黨之反應而定。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕司使十六日上午十時半邀共產黨王炳南晤談的一小時，據美使能發言人康納士稱：大使係將政府業已備就和談之新方案及政府已決定派張治中赴延安兩事轉吿中共，並盼王即請示廷安。據云：大使對此事不作任何表示，純係將政府之意見轉達。又若千人士或認為，比項新方案之內容，目前絕不能公布，以免如過去若干次失敗。至張治中之赴延安，則專待共黨之表示，如表同意，即可啓程前往。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十六日電〕美大使館發言人稱：司徒大使無意與張治中將軍共飛延安。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕張治中十六日晚就國際聯歡社舉仃盛大宴會，邀請蘇大使彼得羅夫，孫科，邵力子，王世杰，麥斯武德曁其他中外名媛數十人，宴畢並舉行舞會，輕云曼舞，深夜始散。</p>
<h3>雷震昨天產抵滬　邀青年民社黨代表洋　研究新言案及和談局勢</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕雷震十五夜車赴滬，將就政府所擬之和談新方案與在滬各黨派人士有所洽商，俾此方案得更能健全，而適合各方面之意見。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕有關方面吿記者，雷震十六日晨來滬，並未携帶新和平方案，其主要任務乃邀請靑年，民社兩黨代表赴京，以便就近研究和平方案及和談局勢。張君　氏至今尙未完全恢復健康，是否赴京尙未定，但民社黨可能另派代表一二人前往。靑年黨除左舜生己因他事於昨夜赴京外，需要時可能加派代表前往。又雷震氏留滬時間預定甚短，如無他故，今夜即擬返京。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕曾琦，左舜生等昨搭夜事晋京，左氏行前語記者，此次晋京乃為參政會駐會委員會開會，俾得一聆政府之經濟，財政報吿，與重開和談無關。留京日數不定，如無他事，陰曆年後即返滬。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕中共發言稱，政府如能在此時取消對中共雜誌報紙之限制，如能在太赦中釋放全體政治犯，則必能改善中共對恢復和談之情緒。論及重開和談事稱，兩項前提必需實施，軍事部份「少退一縣亦不成」，「此事譬如經商，去年已開空頭支票，今年必須現錢交易，方有保證」。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕共產黨發言人梅益，十六日夜車赴滬。</p>
<h3>和淡能否成功　擊於中共態度</h3>
<p>民社黨蔣勻田談話　〔中央社本市訊〕昨為民社黨領袖張君勱氏六一壽辰，該黨同人及張氏友好，特於中午在範圍設　禱嘏，參加者六十餘人，情况極為熱烈。民社黨駐京委員蔣增由氏，亦於昨晨自京趕來祝壽，並對記者談稱：和談方案內容，不外停戰，駐軍地點，地方政權及恢復交通等數項，國共爭執不已，癥結所在，顯為駐軍地點與地方政權兩項迄未解決。以前者而論，兩方爭奪戰略據點，互有得失，非可專責一方，究應恢復何月何日軍事地位，尙有討論之餘地。至言塊方政權，將來行憲時，各地各級政府，均須經過民遷，現在似可不必斤斤於此。總之，現在一切問題，看近些，似乎不能解決，看遠些，就無有不能解決者。渠稱：蔣主席對當前一切問題，具有解決之決心，惟能否如願，全擊於中共之態度如何。蔣氏繼謂，渠定今晚乘車赴京，君勱先生如體力可支，亦將同行。</p>

<h3>西少羣島主權　依天津條約確屬我國</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕我某慰關係方面連日集會，研究西沙羣島問題，準備向法方澈底交涉。按該羣島主權，依二八五年天津條約之附圖，明確屬於我國，然法國於民廿六即曾提出要求，後因戰爭淪於日人手中，勝利後復由我軍接收，孰斜我方主權南瓜明發表後法方復提出要求，該島等早無甚經濟價値，但關係我南洋國防及航業至巨，故我方對之頗重視，決依法究明主權</p>
<h3>海軍上校接收貪污　劉乃沂在平槍決　當庭宣判綁赴天橋執行</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十六日電〕因接收貪汚，被淸查團檢舉，判處死刑之華北區海軍專員辦事處平津分處主任劉乃沂，（海軍上校），今由北平行贛執行槍決。此爲全國清查團檢舉貪污執行槍斃之第一聲。今上午九時四十分將劉自行轅軍法處看守所提出，劉着灰皮袍，黑紴鞋，自監房走出，精紳甚佳。被判死刑，事前毫無所知，渠出監，即被預伏門外之二兵士，上前倒剪二臂，劉始知不妙，推至設公案於院中之法官張傑一前，已面如白紙。法官當即宣判：「劉乃沂侵佔公有財物，判處死刑，褫奪公權終身。鴉片二十九斤十四兩沒收，銷毀藥品本百箱，養球十五斤，黃金八十兩，白金鑽石戒指一個，北平遂安伯胡同房屋一所，沒收。」繼宣佈即行執行死刑，並詢以有無話說？劉聞判後，體現顫抖，答稱，不服判決。法官讚歎　蔣主席有令，着即槍決，如有遺囑，可予代轉。劉乃無言，僅請法官轉知家屬，「希望他們（劉有三妻，一在津，二在平，自被捕後，從未准接見）好好的過日子，孩子要他念書，把家裏東西賣去，遷到南方表住」又稱，「沒收的東西，好多是我私人的」至此官乃投硃筆於地，囑綁·兵士上前將　綑牢，擁上卡車，劉巳不能站立，半伏卡軍前棚，押赴天橋刑塲，一路觀者如堵，呼喝之聲不絕，途遇出殯行列，劉頻點其首。一路無言，抵刑塲後，由二兵氏扶其下車，行數步，即令其面相跪倒。執行者首發一槍，中北部，血自皮袍領目噴出，倒地氣猶未絕，乃發二槍。死後有某不吐姓氏之劉某生前部下，載棺至刑塲收屍而去。劉之在平妻妾，將為其延僧超渡。劉年四十四歲，東北遼陽人妻妾外，尙有二幼子。</p>
<h3>中共未參加制憲　馬歇爾殊感失望</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十五日電〕馬歇爾將軍本星期內將就任國務卿參院外交委員會主席范登堡己保證，共和黨於今後數月內之重要外交問題，支持馬氏。范比上星期曾主張改變對華政策，謂美國應支持中國共產黨以外各黨組織聯合政府，施行新憲法。此言顯指美國將放棄馬帥在華　循之對國共不作左右袒政策。據某外交界　威稱，范氏建議美國支持中國擁護憲政訓黨，或致與馬帥欲在中國實行之政策相枘鑒。惟馬帥對於中共未能參加制憲以便進行改組及擴大政府，殊感失望，此已無可諱言。故共產黨若堅持拒絕接受新憲法，馬帥本人或者亦將贊成美國支持中國之另一集團。</p>
<p>〔又電〕民主黨參議員貝柏，今日在參議院發言，反對范登堡主張變更對華政策，謂范氏爲國務卿內爾納斯　之至友今在克星汶演說，主張美國迎鼓勵中共以外各黨組織聯合政府，施行新憲法，殊足引起誤會。此種意見與馬易爾將軍之建議不合，足使美國與封建主義之「反動派法西斯派及腐化份子」　　一氣。其時范登堡任會塲主席，對貝氏指責，未予答覆。</p>
<h3>憲政實施促進會　蔣主席將任會長</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南東十六日電〕據今日報載，蔣主席將任憲政實施促進委員會長長。</p>
<h3>漢奸可獲假釋放　惟須後悔有據徒刑執行過半者　呈准司法當局即可</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕首都高院趙琛院長十六日談稱：漢奸「有功」者，亦不能倖法，獲得大級或減刑。唯依刑法第七十七條「受徒刑之執行，而有悛悔實據者，無期徒刑逾十年後，有期徒刑逾二分之一後，由監獄官呈司法行政最高官署，得許假釋出獄。但有期徒刑徒刑行不滿一年者，不在此限」將為在獄諸奸出籠之唯一機會。</p>
<h3>冀依照大赦令　釋出囚犯六百人</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社北平十五日電〕冀高等法院院長稱：冀省各監獄囚犯六百名，業已依照大赦令，交保釋放。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春十六日電〕長春地院對應赦　　犯人數，現已調查完竣，並　　知獲赦人犯交保開釋。</p>

<p>〔各衆社北平十六日電〕審判　美軍強姦中國女學生之美軍事法庭庭長休斯，今日自津抵平，與北平美軍總司令費萊斯勃會晤。美官方將在十七日軍事法庭開審後，正式公布法庭人選，美方檢察官，辯護律師及華方證人，本日曾作最后之會晤。</p>
<p>美軍當避今日宣稱：中外記者不得携帶照相機及打字機入法庭，記者之法庭入塲證，上雷有「美軍事法庭審判美政府控訴韋廉姆比遜之案件」。</p>
<p>據今夜所得消息，中國學生擬於十七日在美軍事法庭前舉行一更大之反美遊行。</p>

<h3>陳立夫論馬帥聲明　馬帥指現共黨各點極正確　阻止共黨陰謀即目爲頑固份子</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十五日電〕昨日紐約時報刋載，該報駐南京記者往訪陳立夫氏。紐約時報記者詢以對馬歇爾將軍聲時之意見，陳氏答詞大意如下：　予讀馬氏坦白而好意的聲明後之感想，第一，認為馬氏來中國所負之使命頗多成就，促成中國各黨派團結，（惜最後共產黨未能參加國大）開成國民大會，乃至通過「與去年一月各黨派（共產黨在內）所立原則相符」之民主憲法，馬氏均有所貢獻。第二，認為馬氏看中國問題相當深刻，對於中國共產黨之看法目甚正確，但如能以較多時間與國民黨谷負責幹部及社會人士更多接觸，則其對於中國整個問題之認識，或更正確。第三，認為馬氏指出中國共黨問題，不同於美國共黨問題，幷提醒美國人切勿用看美國共產黨之看法，看中國共產黨，亦甚確當。第四，認為馬氏指出共產黨之「不顧事實」與「不顧人民痛苦」而專從事於「非常有害而具有煽動性」之宣傳，以及推翻政府崩潰經濟之企圖亦甚深刻。第五，認為馬氏指出共產黨為純粹的馬克思主義者，「蓄意在建立一共產形式之政府」，而有異於若干美國人士，誤認共產黨為土地改良者，萬具卓識識。第六，認為馬氏主張中國今後應切實依照憲法完成民主政治工作，幷歡迎各黨派參加政府，尤為完全確當之見解。</p>
<p>吾人所引為遺憾與慚愧者，即為馬氏以一盟國之友，高齡老人，不辭勞苦，爲中國作十三個月之努力奮鬥，而猶不能見諒於少數中國人，即中國共產產黨，而「故意對美國政府之行動政策及目的，加以曲解與設駡，並不顧事實，萬不顧及眞理，顯係用心誤導中國人民及世界各國引起激烈之反美情緒」。讀馬氏「在此種公然設駡及完全不顧事實之情形下，保特緘默旣感困難，如加否認，則每日必須否認，是誠美國官員所不能忍受之事」數語其衷心之懊喪苦痛可知。然而熟知共黨之慣技者，並不以此為異，廿年來中共又何嘗不以同一方法甚且十百倩過之，對其本國政府與本國同胞，而故意對國民政府及國民黨之行為政策及目的加以曲解。誤述。謾罵　。誤導中國人民及世界人士引起激烈之反中國反中國政府及國民黨之情緒。即以予個人而論，予實為抗戰之初最先努力國共合作，且己一手初步完成合作工作之人，而中共迄今所最曲解誣蔑與尋篤者，亦為予一人。故熟知中共之慣技者，自應不以此為怪。　余猶須坦白指出者，即國大國民黨代表中，大多數份子俱為受有英美自由思想或多或少之敎育與影響者，亦即中共惡意宣傳已久之所謂「反動份子」或「頑固份子」，實則即爲此次國大通過「與去年一月各黨派政協會議所定原則完全相符」的民主憲法之「進步份子」或「自由份子」。共黨善於製造名詞加之於人，其宣轉方法又甚技巧，故其影響。每易使人炫惑不明，甚或誤假為眞，而不自知，究其實，廿年來，在中國凡揭發或阻止共黨顚覆政府或「蓄意建立一共產形式之政府」之陰謀者，莫不被目為「反動份子」或「頑固份子」耳。</p>
<p>科學家解決科學問題之方法，祇有多多與現象接觸，多多分析並研究其內容，然後方有發現頭撲不破的事實之可能。政治家研究或解決政治問題、之方法，應亦如是。馬氏以十三個月之長期留駐中國，憑其智慧熱誠及其所採用之科學熊度與方法，故能發現，共黨之行動中，「有一非常有害而具有煽性之事實」，故能發現「固執之共黨人士，絕不猶疑使用激烈之手段，以求達其目的」，故能發現共黨為絕對馬克斯主義者，所有目前一切言行，均係手段與政策，而其目的則「在中國建立一共產形式之政府，或於過渡時期內組織英美式之民主政府」。至於英美式之民主政府，正與本黨數十年來所奮鬥所追求的民權主義之理想相吻合，亦即依此次國民大會所通過的憲法而產生之政府也。</p>

<h3>治黃工程屆緊要關頭　堵口决不可延緩　彭部長對記者說法明理由</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十六日電〕中宣部於今日下午四時在該部會議室舉行記者招待會，關於共產黨要求花園口黃河堵日延期五個月完工一節，彭部長學沛於答復記者訊間時，作下列之設明稱，</p>
<p>治理黃河之初步工作，現已屆緊要關頭，此項工程，有重火理由，不使延綏，堵口不久可望完工，使河流回歸一九三八年之故道，此工程計劃早已為全國及世界所周知，並革新措施。目前需要於鄭州東廿公里將一百七十公尺之決口堵塞，此為全長四百公尺缺口中所餘剩之一部分，其餘二百三十公尺，業經用石塊塡塞，高出於水面。此工虧一簣之工作，何以不便展緩。其理由如次。</p>
<h3>詳明闡述　三項理由</h3>
<p>（一）堵口之方法，係採用平堵，先打一百十九排木樁，四根一排，深入中流，上舖以木板，形成橋梁，橋面設以窄軌，以便運送石塊，拋入河中，工作如中途停頓，則木樁石塊均有隨時冲去之可能，即僅欲使石堤保持目前之高度，在停工期間亦須繼續拋塡石塊，以補充被冲刷之部分，此實虛耗材料及人力，所用之洋松木材，係自美國輸人，而石塊則需經鐵路田他處運來。（二）現在能面尙低，流量每秒鐘平均約一情此形，不立方公尺，種水千　繼甚久，二月初以後，「凌汎」即屆，冰塊力量足以載斷堤岸，即使能抵抗凌汎之冲激，至三月下旬之「桃汎」又來，屆時流量達每秒鐘四千立方公尺，據估計，在陝縣流量如超過每秒鐘一千五百立方公尺時，堤岸即有危險。七月底「秋汎」來時，流量最高峯將達每秒鐘三萬立方公尺，此乃一年內最危險之時期，所以最適宜施工之季節，只為自十月中旬迄正月底。（三）缺口堵塞之後，河水可以流入故道，水量自春迄秋漸漸增加，工程師有充分時間觀察黃河在其原來河床中所取之實際路綫，水道迂廻於南北堤岸之間，兩岸相距有時達數公里，彼等可趕於此時際加强下游河堤之單薄部分，倘如共黨之要求工程延緩五個月，則堵口完工離秋汎　遠，河北山東下　之河堤，有多處決口之虞，人民禍害不堪設想。</p>
<h3>河床居民　遷移便利</h3>
<p>中共宣傳謂：抗戰期間移住於故道之人民，將受損害，吾人下難切實答復，萬河床中所搭蓋者並無永久性之房屋，均係易於遷移之臨時棚戶，蓋黃河運早必須挽回故道，無人下知，因此中共宣傳不免誇張。或謂當河流復迫時，將有數百萬居民被冲刷而去，更屬危詞聳聽，根據中共最初提出之調查數字，應遷徙之居民只有十五萬人，目前黃河之水已有十分之一流入故道，其流速每小時僅一華里，深不及一米突，其速度較人類步行尙為遲緩，巨量之水先受乾涸河床之吸收，然後餘水方得前進，即全河改流後，亦不致遽成汹湧之洪流也。</p>
<p>現將由政府，中共，以及行總，聯總代表合組之賑款發放隊，沿舊河床向受到影響之人民發放賑款，每人的可得十萬元。</p>
<p>一九三八年黃河改道，受災人民約有六百十萬之多，堵口完工後，均可重返家園，糧食生產可望激增。</p>
<h3>黃泛區難民團　籲請早日堵口</h3>
<p>〔中央社開封十五日電〕黃泛區流亡汴垣難民及同鄉，為反對中共阻撓堵口政策，曾組織泛區難民團遊行請願，呼籲元成堵口，俾克早還鄉里。頃又聞中共仍堅持即刻塞閉引河，停止堵口工作，特於十五日下午召開會議，議決：（一）分電國府主席，行　·。黨部，分別發電中央呼籲。</p>
<h3>趙守鈺抵鄭州　監督堵口工程</h3>
<p>〔中央社鄭州十五日電〕黃委會趙委長守鈺，十四日來鄭，下午陪同經鄭西返之蒙古國大代表達瓦等十餘人，赴花園口參觀堵口工程。據趙氏談：此來係監督工程，最近暫不返汴。</p>
<h3>善建會議代表　視察泛區返汴</h3>
<p>對一切設施甚表滿意</p>
<p>〔中央社開封十五日電〕黃泛區善後建設會議，十一日閉幕後，與會各代表，各專家，相率赴泛區扶溝，中牟等守地視察，今日返汴。據悉：各代表對泛區一切設施，甚表滿意，惟以堵口完成後，流亡各地泛區難胞，勢必大批還鄉，則泛區生產能力未恢復前，食糧問題勢必極感巖重，應速設法預為解決。</p>
<h3>孫連仲專機返平　據談熊式輝張治中入京有任務　外間一切傳說俱不可靠</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十六日電〕孫連仲今日下午二時半專機飛返平，當接見本報記者，據談：（一）當局確考慮將戰區改綏署，以資劃一，惟尙無具體決定。關於華北之軍政人事更移傳說皆不確。並稱：熊式輝晋京，係商東北運糧及團隊問題，張治中晋京係商新省軍隊整編問題外間對熊張傳說，俱不可靠。（二）南京時局沉悶，和談無開展，華北因國家整個動向未定，亦只好維持現狀。長官部因保定房屋缺乏，兼以鐵路公路尙未能安全暢通，故全部移保尙有待。平漢路交通恢復，因材料缺乏及治安力量等複雜條件，刻正逐步進行，元氏迄安陽間鐵路之恢復亦待大局轉移。（三）冀省因係綏靖區直無收入可言，一年政費短細五百億，預算此次赴京，與宋院長商洽後，將重新編擬。孫氏末稱：渠最行將赴冀東唐山等地視察</p>

<h3>為越南僑胞請命！</h3>
<p>自越南發生武裝衝突以來，我們一直關心越南局勢的發展，為了四十餘萬僑胞生命財產的安全，時時刻刻期望法越衝突能獲得和平解決。但是截至目前為止，我們所期望的都沒有實現的可能了。在法國援軍源源開到越南之後，法軍已在前綫發動攻勢；此在越盟方面，這是越南的解放運動，不達目的決不會中止的，越盟總統胡志明於十五日發表文吿，也重言聲明：「越南人民將作戰到底」。所以從法越雙方的態度看來，法越衝突很少有早日結束的希望。</p>
<p>但是「城門失火，殃及池魚」，越南的戰事一日不停止，則越南僑胞生命財產的安全即一日無保障，我們對這些可憐無靠的僑胞，怎能坐視不救！？尤其是河內華僑區，被越軍佔據後，即為法軍所包圍，與外界完全隔離，糧食飲水，均已發生問題，不僅物質生活發生恐慌，而且法軍隨時有大舉反攻的可能，飛機大砲的威脅，迫在每一個僑胞的限前，怎敎他們不人人自危呢？</p>
<p>越南僑胞代表顏忍夫與楊問鐘二人，遄返祖國向政府請願要求政府緊急保護僑胞，前天在滬招待同業，說明僑胞所要求祖國政府者，共有五項要求：（一）緊急救濟在越南的僑胞；（二）派政府大員前往越南宣撫僑胞並調查損失；（三）責成法越雙方賠償損失，（四）請求越方釋放被枸捕之僑胞；並解放在各地中途被阻之僑胞，使其得歸返城市；（五）　派飛機運送米糧·藥品接濟被困僑胞，並即將該機載運婦孺返國。</p>
<p>這幾項要求，實在是緊急救濟越南僑胞最有效的辦法，政府保護海外僑胞責無旁貸，自應迅速採取有效的緊急措置，切莫再使在越南受災難的僑胞失望。我們每一提起海外僑胞在異國所受的委屈，總覺得罄竹難書，是一部說不盡的傷心史。在過去我們千怨萬怨，終怨國家的荏弱，沒有力量保護僑胞在海外從事工商的事業；但是在抗戰勝利後的今日，無論如何，國際地位終算已經提高了，我國代表在歷决國際會議中發言，列强也不得不尊重我們的意見而特別予於重視。假如我國外交常局，能够運用得當，則保護僑胞在國外的合法利益，自在其能力所及的範國以內，尤其是保護僑胞生命財產的安全，更可認為沒有問題的。姑以這次越南事件而論吧！我國駐河內總領事袁十健，雖竭盡其保護僑胞的職責，曾一再向法越雙方提出建議，主張在越南劃分一中立區，俾由華僑與愛好和平的越南人民居住，但是這個安全計劃，始終未能實現。我們推原其故，實因我國政府未能以充分的權力授與袁子健總領事，傳由其據理力爭，有以致之。使我們對於外交與僑務當局，不能不表示相當的遺憾。</p>
<p>往事不諫，來者可迫，當前最感迫切的問題，乃在政府迅速採取具體而有效的護僑措置。對於僑胞代表所提出的五項要求，更有琊重加以考慮的必要。法越衝突一時沒有和平解決的希望，四十餘萬的僑胞有如倒懸，時時刻刻期望兩國的急救；事急矣，政府千萬不能再熟視無賭，或者還要從容計議，聽任數十萬的僑胞得不到祖國的保護而致喪生。行政院通過的兩項辦法，（一）撥款二百萬越幣救濟越北華僑；（二）由有關部會組織調查團赴越北調查僑胞所受損失。我們總認為尙嫌不足，區區二百萬越幣，有如杯水車薪，仍無濟於事！調查旣屬蓋後性質，此舉決不足保護僑胞的安全！要之，我們切望政府，不能忽視越南僑胞的生命財產的安全，而應迅速採取有效的緊急辦法，一則藉此以救濟越南垂危的僑胞，另則也可以吿慰在其他各處的僑胞！</p>
<p>技術上的指導</p>
<p>工商輔導處近有組織技術委員會之一議，其任務為以若干工業專家，義務地協助各工廠解決技術問題，此舉很値得稱道。因為為現在生產所以衰落之故，技術上的不够，確是原因之一。或以此項專門人才根本太少，不易羅致，或以規模太小，無力羅致此項人才，所以由公家供給專家，盡義務，替廠家解決技術問題，確是一件很需要，很有價値的工作。</p>
<p>官應對於工廠，表面上的帮助，向來並不缺乏。例如扶助，獎勵，保育，促進這些名目，大家都耳熟能詳。但廠商實際所能得到的實惠幾何，這似乎又是一個問題。我們確會聽到過工商家抱怨地說：政府少替我們找些麻煩，也就够了；我們根本不希望他們能給予多少帮助。原來跟着那些好聽的名詞，便有一通串的手績和表格分發下來，而且各制各的表式，各定各的手續，雖然大同小異，却是分道揚鏣。有許多的地方，並且調製得十分細膩，如果沒有專門的人才，和經過久長的期問考簡直不易應付。有時還特地派了委員來，當面質詢，調查，察，翻閱證件，不得不承應，招待，陪同視察。而最後結果，還不是替他們的檔案室平添了許多無用的資料？事過境遷，能　見到一個統計的數字，還算是有成續的，有許多調查表，簡市連一個統計的數字也不見。至於平時的一般工作，無論是何作用，也總是取締，箝制的成分居多而缺乏獎掖，扶助的實惠與熱情。所以派遺專家，替廠家設計改進，解決疑難，而且絕不收取費用，這還是値得大書特書的事。</p>
<p>有人認為目前工業界的迫切需要，還不僅是按術上的事。有了工廠，沒有原料；要買原料，缺乏資金；人手，原料都齊全了，又沒有充分的電力；徼倖地能開工了，產品的銷各，又往往為　價的洋貨所堵塞；加以拆息高得怕人，工資與日俱長；舊稅不除，新稅接踵而來；單是駁運，裝卸，其費用竟等於滬美閒之水脚；諸如此類，無法改善，僅僅改進技術，何濟於事？這些話確是事實，我們並不否認。但技術是技術，與這些問題，不能混為一談。俗語說的好：大處着眼，小處做起，何况技術問題，還不能算是小處呢？</p>
<p>曾聽到紡織業某君談：我國的紡織機器和技術，比美國要差若千年，比日本差若千年，甚至比印度也要差若干年。以此為例，可知上面這許多問題縱能解決，但技術方面，倘不能迎頭趕上，急起直追，那麽，我國工業前途，還是不能樂觀。</p>
<p>拿出口貨來說：許多製品，趕不上海外市塲的標準，以至退貨時聞，銷路日减。其中雖尙有攙入作弊等原因在內，但是技術太劣，無法與人競爭，常然也是一個主因。</p>
<p>至於洋貨充斥，國人不喜歡用國貨，其唯一的藉口，也無非是品質太差，效用太低之故。尋其原因，除掉原料問題外，也不得不推技術為主因。所以改進技術，不單是挽救工業的手段之一，也是推銷國貨，和維持出口的切要辦法。希望工商輔導處對於這個新建議，能够無怠無忽，切實推行，一雪官應從來空晉無補之恥，並望廠家儘量利用，勿辜負這種善意。</p>

<p>分化德國防止復興</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約十五日電〕法前總理兼外長皮杜爾，本日向紐約泰晤士報訪員發表談話稱：四强對於德國問題業已詳細闡明其立塲者，僅法國一國而已。法國希望薩爾區獨立，但須在經濟上及財政上與法國取得聯擊。至於在政治上，則法國不欲與之發生關係，蓋以法國深知薩爾區八十萬居民均為日耳曼人故也。關於魯爾區則應予獨立，並實行國際化，此在萊茵區則應脫離德國，而置於盟國軍事管制之下，總之，德國務使其成為地方分權之聯邦國，余認為魯爾區之煤礦，應在類似英國煤礦收歸國有之制度下加以開發，務使全歐洲均受其益，德國人民實為强大與危險之民族，德國之强盛除對其本身有利而外，對於其他國家殆無任何裨益，若有人認為德國再趨强大之後，將改變其原有思想，則誠愚不可及矣。法國希望德國成為一聯邦國，其故亦即在此。</p>

<h3>義法西斯巨魁　孟太納尚在人間</h3>
<p>一度傳說他被指定為墨索里尼之繼承人……</p>
<p>他曾判墨氏愛婿齊亞諾死刑……</p>
<p>他曾統率黑衫師團侵攻阿爾巴尼亞……</p>
<p>他在南斯拉夫所關戰犯名單中名列前茅……</p>
<p>〔務合社護大利某處十五日電〕墨索里尼之短命社會黨共和國通亡領袖孟太納，一度曾傳說被指定為墨氏之繼承人，現方變易姓名，隱居於義大利偏僻之鄉村內。孟氏任法西斯共和國警察長，直至戰爭結束為止，並為法西斯法庭之法官，判定墨氏愛婿外交部長齊亞諾死刑，據孟自稱係得友人中有力者之援助，始得卜居於此。孟氏髮已花自，現正撰述回憶錄，為法西斯主義作辯護。義軍侵入阿爾巴尼亞時，孟氏曾統帶黑衫師團，其後復在南斯拉夫統率法西斯民團。南斯拉夫所索義大利戰犯中，孟氏為名列前茅之人。一年以來，偕其髪光黝黑之夫人與一四歲女兒，同居在地中海畔養大利村外簡陋之公寓中。予等行　一狹仄小弄，而達其樸質無華之寓所，孟氏匿居其中，時有被捕之危險。</p>
<p>據導者言，孟氏係受有力者保護，故得無恙。其擊友奧蘭太為另一法西斯通亡將領，亦同樣匿居在義大利境內。孟氏接見記者兩人，並無恐懼不安之像，迨告以決下將其區居地點洩露於人，即與記者暢談。孟氏自言其回憶錄中將記載墨索里尼之善行。以待後人評判，希望在本人無需避匿之時，即可將此書公之於世。孟氏並朗誦其中一節，述墨索里尼在米蘭之最後情形稱，「予方與民族解放委員會代表談判投降條件，墨氏則往見米蘭大主敎，隨時怒氣勃勃，斥民族解放委員會為賊黨，命予停止談判。予以墨氏之決議報吿委員會，返抵司令部則學氏已行。數小鸚後，總氏為黨人所獲，旋於一九四五年四月執行死刑，墨氏若待予同行，予今日常已不在人世矣一？</p>
<p>孟氏於戰爭結束後，輾轉逃避聯合國及義大利管察耳目，歷時　久，某次曾在羅馬遭美軍謀報員盤詰三日，卒獲放行，孟氏認共產主義為人類文明最大之癮患，始終信仰法西斯主義，今日在義大昨依然活着。迨問以對墨索里尼之感想如何，則稱，墨氏錯誤太多，故最後對之已失去信仰。問對希特勒之意見如何，孟氏聳屆作輕蔑狀日，「他巳戰敗了」。</p>

<h3>韓人反對託管　明舉行大示威　要求霍奇拒絕蘇主張</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約十五日電〕韓國駐聯合國機構代表殷路易今日稱：韓人定於星期六舉行抗議四强託管韓國之示威，決非武力暴動，屆時農工商各界男女將在韓國各城遊行，要求美軍司令霍奇將軍，拒絕蘇聯主張僅許共黨代表韓人參加結束美蘇軍管制之談判之要求，此為集國抗議之表示，決非武力暴動云。又據韓國某新聞代表稱：此次示威規模之大，或當使霍奇將軍驚駭，一年前韓人亦有同樣性質之示威，當時軍隊曾動員，並以坦克車及機關槍等向遊行者示威。又股氏已函美國議員，要求在韓國南北兩部統一以前，使南部之韓人獲得民主自治灣。渠指出韓人雖不同情共產主義，然北部蘇軍區內韓人，實享有更多之自治權，其糧食亦較南部為佳。</p>

<p>〔聯合社柏林十五日電〕蘇聯准許發行之「德國快報」今日載稱，蘇聯官員正與德政界領袖舉行極重要之會議，討論有關德國生存前途之根本計劃。賠償問題為主要討論事項，蘇軍事當局顯然進備對德國之願望表示讓步，尤其對於拆卸德工廠一事為然。關於自德國現有生產中提出賠償一點，蘇聯對於德國一切合理的願望，亦將加以廣泛的考慮，然後加以解決。該報此項消息發表於倫敦四外長會議討論對德奧和約之時，自堪注意。德蘇會議之地點並未宣布，大抵在蘇聯總司令部所在之卡爾沙斯特，蘇聯贊助之社會黨確曾參加會議。該報稱，討論之切實結果，可望數日內產生。該項會議將使德國獲得更實質的結果，較諸最近前往倫敦徒許願心不幸空手而歸之德人，不可同日而語云。按社會民主黨領袖許曼顯，最近曾往英國，該報即針對此人而言。該報復稱，目前之會議極度重要，理由有二：第一，使德國至少為蘇聯佔領區之德國，知這其復興之經濟基礎。第二，蘇聯所採取之溫和與協調政策，對於未來莫斯科外長會議必將發生影響。或將導致莫斯科會議其他代表採取同樣路綫。</p>

<h3>九百餘義奧籍僑民　欣然冒雨乘輪歸國</h3>

<h3>年黨糾紛暗潮洶湧　職員笑說大掃除　顧客無法入門來　永安董事得年禮鏹水一瓶　玻璃窗上塗白粉滿標語　「愁工」之後又有「勤工」</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕因年賞問題而引起之勞資糾紛，近日仍暗潮洶湧，未稍平靜。南京路永安公司於前日起，亦因年賞問題，勞方忽發起所謂「清潔運動」，所謂勞資料糾紛之別出心裁者。連日職工方面已在玻璃　上，滿貼紅綠標語，令人置身其間，頗有目迷五色之感。同時職工並印發傳單，向各界聲述苦衷。其中略稱：「關於要求年終花紅問題，不時今年資方未加置理，即去年應發之花紅，亦有賴掉之企圖」，故職工認爲此事之發動　爲「被迫」出此云。但正當「糾紛」展開之際，不料永安公司董事宋常超寓所（膠州路一四九弄三號）於昨晨十時半許，忽來一客，手携二紙匣，僞作　贈年禮，迨叩門送入後，旋即返身告退。事後，經聞啓紙匣，始發現內有橘子數枚，及　水一瓶，察其動機，意在桐嚇，事極顯明。宋常超即據情報告靜安寺警察分局。據悉此次永安工潮，宋即爲代表資方者云。</p>
<p>又國貨公司按照往年舊例，年終向有加薪百分之二十之舉，但今年職工援例要求，資方以營業不景氣，未獲妥洽。因此全體職工昨日起亦開始「行動」，實行所謂「大掃除」運動，此與永安公司之「清潔運動」實有異曲同工之妙。當昨日顧客登門時，職工皆羣集大門之前，口稱：「請你們不要進去了，裏面在大掃除」。同時沿路之大玻璃窗上，亦滿塗白粉，果似大掃除然。實則當時情景，頗似平劇中演唱之「空城計」也。</p>
<p>又悉：此次國貨公司之「大掃除」又名「勤工」。同憶日前小呂宋百貨商店曾有「愁工」之舉，所謂花樣翻新，日新月異。查「勤工」與「愁工」有別，「愁工」乃係職工滿面「愁」容，不招呼客人，純以一別「哭喪着臉」之姿態出現。而「勤工」之說，在表面上，則樂於工作，爲公司掃門窗，拖地板，而使客人無法入門，老　見之，實啼料不是，笑亦不可能，無異「啞子吃黃蓮」也。</p>
<h3>南匯魁在滬落綱　綁架寶山農婦被困六十餘日　供出一隊長有關同時亦拘獲</h3>
<p>警備部近據密報，浦東南匯縣境內有大批匪徒，約二十餘人，有輕機槍及長短槍等武器，在南匪一帶，擾民搶刦，無惡不作，並於上年十一月三日綁架住石頭沙潘石鄉之　山農婦施張美郎（五十二），當由稽查處派浦東稽查所偵辦，經該所哨長楊福林，縝密偵查之下，知綁架係匿居南匯縣之匪首陸阿二所爲，時施之家　，已接匪方來信，約期</p>
<p>接洽贖票</p>
<p>，便派幹員化裝爲施家親屬，携带匪方規定之信物及規定之南滙縣東海濃之外三　地方，僞與方接洽。當時由楊哨長會同浦東聯防指揮部及南匯縣保安大隊派員埋伏老江海浜一帶，另派稽查員黃鼎化裝與匪接洽購票條件。黃至指定地點後，詎匪徒</p>
<p>狡猾異常</p>
<p>，先將黃鼎抄查後即帶至該處一小屋內，時匪徒派人在外放哨望風，而在小室內與黃接洽讀票手續，在該處埋伏之部隊因該處理面　　，待趕到後匪徒已下海而去，故無所獲，稽查處認爲此案着手困難，不能以硬功對付，仍派員赴該處鄉保長處，囑該保長出函致與匪徒，函內</p>
<p>曉以大義</p>
<p>，令匪方釋放施張氏。至元月四日施張氏果獲匪方之無條件釋放回家，據張氏報告被綁經過，據云十一月三日在石頭沙潘石鄉地方被綁，即在該處東灘下海乘船，回至獨山。五日上岸越三個山頭，至九龍山一民家，同日夜半回至獨山。六日晨往金山嘴，露宿三天，後帶至某港口，在匪窟被困的六十餘日，始獲匪方無條件釋放，並給予法幣八千元</p>
<p>作爲路費</p>
<p>。自施張氏脫險後，該哨長楊福林，仍各方嚴密偵查匪踪，後在上海北京路芝罘路交通皮鞋店隔壁，巧遇匪首陸阿二，乃暗　跟隨，至西藏路汕頭路口，將其抯獲。訊得綁架施張氏確有其事，但係其部下顧小根所爲，並供出綁架有關之某方常備大隊長陳山有關，後由稽查人員在南市小南門薛家浜陸家衖轉角平房內，將陳山拘獲，現正在偵訊中。</p>
<h3>前工部局華員養老金　關鍵在乎倍數問題　若照指數計算　須達六百餘億　外籍職員尙不包括在內　有待市長最後決定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前工部局華籍職員，以勝利一年餘來，其儲蓄金，養老金，退職金等分文未得，失業以後，生活實難以維持，曾數度往英鎭事　集體請願，未得結果。前日吳市長已表示對於彼等處境，極爲關懷，決囑財政局清理委員會從速辦理。吳市長當即於昨日上午召見財政局長谷春帆，詳詢清理委員會進行情形，並商計　還辦法。記者即於昨午五時，走訪谷局長，詢以會談結果，據谷局長語記者稱：財局清理委員會之工作乃按照前工部局之章程，分別計其其應得之數目，此舉極易，數週後即可告成。然關鍵在乎償遲之倍數問題，因根據清理委員會結算結果，爲數極徵，有小至數百元者。至於是否應舊有華籍職員之請求，按照生活指數發給，或乘以相當之倍數，則有待於吳市長作最後之決定，財政局固無權定　也。按前工部局華籍職員約共千餘人，據有關方面透露，其儲蓄金，退職金，及養老金之總數約近十萬，其中根據其職位高低，任職年限多寡，上下頗大，最小者僅一二百元，最大者約爲五六百元。若按生活指數六千五百餘倍計策，則市府須償還之數目，須達六百餘億元。在經濟極度拮据之目前，賞成一大難題，又此數尙未包括外　職員在內，查前工部局外　職員約有五六百人，其單位及任職年限各不相問，計算時亦極繁複，英籍人士以英鎊爲單位。聞其中有任職歷二三十年之高級職員，計算其應得之總數，有達數萬英鎊者，至於市府究將按照何種比例償還，實難以決定，蓋勝利以後，尙無比先例，如勝利公債等，均未加以償還。又據一般推測，中央恐不至有所補貼，因工部局之一切財產，均由地方加以接收，其債務口亦應由地方償還也。</p>
<h3>行總萬象輪私載客貨　全體通同舞弊　牽涉之人過多一時尙難審結</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行總萬象輪私載旅客不法圖利一案，昨日地院再審，被告計楊威臣，太吉生，林世醒，韓興才，楊記水，楊金貴，　實金，唐盛松，　瑜達，奎克，金阿毛等十一人。查楊威臣係行總職員，於去年十月間，　　救濟物資至天津，青島二處，趁　攬載旅客三十二人，每人收費十二萬元，由船主奎克興協分相，楊得三分之一，　　得三分之二。又水手楊　水，經　　　　益旗行社之介紹，串通船員林世　，韓興才，亦私帶旅客四十三人，共同旅客收得七百二十一萬元，後由楊紀木提出四百三十七萬元賄予船主。同時舵工楊金貴，則由其友人誼寶金介紹到旅客二十三人，每人收費二十五萬元，除付船方每名二十萬元，其餘五萬元由楊董兩人分用。此外有唐盛松介紹裝運麵粉七百包，每包收費三千元，金阿毛介紹裝米一千包，每包收費一萬五千元，其中三分之二歸船主，三分之一由全船員工平分。更有伙夫　，專爲水上警察分局所悉，將全船員工連所嚴客一百三十餘人，一併拘獲，移送地檢處，檢察官以　輪上至船主大嗣，下至船工伙夫，全體貪污，不法已極，特依　洽依法條例第三條第六項提起公訴。昨日處上各被告對私載旅客。部份雖已供認，但牽涉人過多，一時尙難審結，庭論改期再審</p>
<h3>大美晚報工人罷工　資方呈報市政當局　不獲協議準備申請調解</h3>
<p>本市英文大美晚報，昨日因印刷工人突然罷工，致未出版。據該報黨局發表消息：罷工行動係於發給一個月新年賞金及本月份上半月薪金後發生，工人方面，事前並未申請期間，停工一週，如不停工，則須發給雙薪，並每人借款三十萬元，該報社長高爾總群，當向工方發表聲明，略謂：「市政當局曾通知本報，舊曆新年期間，並無正式假期，故本報決定僅於舊曆元旦放假一日。關於年賞問題，本報已發給雙新一月，不能再發其他任何特別津帖或借款。至對此次之罪工事件，本報擬即申請市政當局予以嚴竣處置，準備於必要時，商得市政當局同意，將工塲關閉，重行改組」云云。工人方面，昨曾兩度停止工作，但旋即復工，及至獲悉資方無讓步之意，始正式實行罷工。該報經理部已將昨日情況，呈報市政當局，並準備如直接協議不能迅速成立，即申請調解。</p>

<h3>公地清查一年　最近始告段落　已接收總面積計六七六四畝　現正辦理登記完成法定手續</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕目前參議會開會時，曾有人質詢地敵當局處理本市公產情形，並要求將所有公地平價租予市民造屋，以解決一部份　荒問題。記者昨特以本市公地清　情形，往　地政局楊秘書，承告情形如下：公地清查工作，開始迄今，已將一載，實施之初，以舊兩租界公產檔案均有　缺，面各區地籍又極紊亂困難頗多，及至最近，始告一段落，現查明本市已接收之十八區內公地計一千二百四十九無所坵，達二千一百餘畝。上項公地現正辦理公　登記，以完成法定手續。</p>
<p>敵僞出售公地</p>
<p>敵僞對公地之處分，經查明敵人控制工事局時期，自三十年十二月八日起至三十二年七月底，由敵人出面處分出售之公地，計九十七坵，共一五八畝八分七厘。僞市府出售之公地自三十二年八月一日「接收」兩租界起至三十四年八月抗戰勝時爲止，計售出一三七畝九分四厘。</p>
<p>維希政府時期</p>
<p>前浩公董局在雜希政府時期出售公地，自三十二年二月二十三日法政府宣佈放棄在日華特　，同年五月十九日國府聲明取消法國在華特權以後，至周年八月一日將法租界移交僞府以前，計售出二十七坵，共五六畝二分三厘九毫。法公董局未移交之公地計四十八坵，共三二三畝三分五厘四毫。</p>

<h3>江山好改性難易　兩逢大赦又做盜</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨晨十一時卅分，老　分局施分局長親率員營，乘吉普卡在轉境內巡　，并搜查可疑行人，行至芝罘路天然飯店門首，瞥見一西裝者行動可疑，施分局長即飭員　下車，擬加搜檢，詎該人團拔步飛齊逃，警士即隨後尾追，結果卒將其槍擭。當在其懷中抄出毛瑟手槍一支，子彈八發，乃帶局偵訊。據悉，該人確係劇盜，廿年前會犯強盜殺人案，被捕後，判處無期徒刑，曾逢大赦，減爲徒型十四年；新近又經大赦，始釋放出獄，爲期僅歷數日，又犯過盜案一次。</p>

<h3>彈詞評話鼓書</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕上海娛樂中，聽書比較清靜，戲院中鑼鼓喧天，不免大刺耳，看電影也許會眼花，於是一班好靜的人，便到書塲中去消曆時光，一面品茗，一面聽書，別有一種風味。而且座價不貴，化了一千元的茶資，可以坐上兩三小時，最爲經濟合算。</p>
<p>說書分評話彈詞兩種，俗稱「大書」「小書」。評話取材於歷朝興廢，戰事勝負，大都是英雄義士的故事，全　口說，將生日淨醜各種角色表演出來，必須形神俱到，方爲上乘。彈詞以三弦琵琶伴獎，邊彈邊唱，繪聲繪影，將才子佳人的戀愛故事，播之弦索，亦能引人入勝。</p>
<p>說書以姑蘇爲大本營，業此者大都爲吳人，其同業組織名「光裕社」歷史很久。後來浙系又有「潤裕社」，起與光裕社分庭抗禮，但一般人因愛聽吳　軟語，故其勢力終不敵。說書的藝人，過去多爲男子，舊有女說書一名詞，則大都爲北裏名姝，用以應酬客人者，女子歌喉一串，本能動人，最宜彈唱，於是女子說書亦成組織，名普餘社，與光裕潤裕鼎足而三。有時男女拼擋，或夫婦合唱，或父女同合，頗能受人歡迎，直至評話彈詞研究會成立，才打破了三者的界限。</p>
<p>說書盛行於江南浙西一帶，不論城市鄉鎭，都有他們的踪跡，但以語言關係，京滬路至常州以上，浙省在杭城以南，即無法立足。在上海，過去也只是遊戲塲中的玩意兒，雖有幾家茶園式的書塲，座客不過以小市民爲主。自無綫電播音興起，說書者始交紅運，因彈詞是最適於播音，叮叮噹噹之聲，到處皆是，隨時可聽矣。</p>
<p>說書靠無綫電播音，吸引不少高尚人士，於是打動了會做生意眼的人，紛紛設立新式書塲，　南京，東方等處，莫不黑壓壓地擠滿滿了人。說書雖以聽爲主，但形容書中角色，無綫電究竟竟不及合上彈唱來得生動，所以無綫電　感，書塲營業仍不生影響。抗戰以後，電台播音，一度衰落，書塲更擁擠不堪，先前停業之書塲，紛紛復業，新設者也不少。今全市書塲共二十餘家，其中以石路的匯泉樓歷史最爲悠久，已歷六七十年，成都路之滄州書塲，塲子寬大，座位舒適，爲書塲中設備之最高貴者。在各種帶有地方色彩的娛樂中，說書也能抓住不少座客。</p>
<p>南方人喜歡彈詞，北方人受好大鼓。大鼓有種種類別，如京音大鼓，梨花大鼓，八角快書等等。在上海只有偶然抬頭的機會，不能持久。過去僅附設於遊藝塲中，作爲　要的一擋，並沒有軍獨的塲子。那時鼓書有二個地　，一在新世界，鼓王劉寶全，小黑姑娘，張少軒等，都在那裏唱過，另一處在大世界，薛大王，老矮瓜，小九齡等曾在那裏登合。</p>
<p>民國廿一年，黃楚玖知足處　址關爲北平書塲，此爲北方鼓書在上海彈獨演出的噶矢。那時除主角白雲鵬小黑姑娘外，尙有八角快書何質臣，樂亭織板楊　琴，滑稽大鼓山藥旦，搭配很是整齊，上座也還不錯。可惜只滇了兩個月就停止了。後來四馬路跑馬廳附近的天蟾茶樓，大中華飯店的樓下，也都演唱過鼓書，尤其是鼓王劉寶全來滬奏持的幾次，曾　動一時。</p>
<p>劉寶全對大鼓一道，其造詣可謂空前。歌喉天賦，高朗圓潤，加以　色表情，觀衆精神一振。聽其演「寗武關」，令人興奮不維，歌「大西廂」，則又婀娜風流，細膩萬分，語言動作，維妙維肖，而且律已甚嚴，屏絕烟賭酒色　　，故在廿八年最後一次南來之時，雖已七十一歲，但精神仍　　　，嗓音依然嘹亮，除了　後一撮斑白的禿髮以外，並不像照年逾古稀的老人。</p>

<p>〔聯合社南京十六日電〕中航公司飛機兩架，，（共載乘客廿二人）美國陸軍C—54型運輸機一架（其四座引擎中一座業已損壞），十六日晨於半小時內，先後在南京大霧籠罩之機塲上安全降陸。空軍司令周至柔及美國軍事顧問團航空組主任麥克納准將，均在機塲注意觀察地面之控制塔與陸軍運輸機上各機員技巧合作，使此業已受損之巨型機安全降落於跑道上。</p>
<p>當時霧氣甚濃，自機塲管理處眺望跑道，幾糢糊不辨。運輸機降落後一分鐘後，中航公司C—47型第五十號運輸機，由上海載客十一人飛往漢口，亦　濃霧中穿出，降落機塲。閱廿分鐘，中航公司滬平班Ｃ—47型第五十四號運輸機，自上海載客十一人，擬經由南京靑島至北平，亦於惡劣氣候中降落跑道。常時天時雖逐漸轉惡，駕駛員仍將飛機留在高空，俟陸軍機先行着陸，以免空中相撞。此陸軍機係由奧文斯中尉駕駛，自上海載給養赴成都，接濟華西美軍墳墓登記隊途中一座引擎損壞，因距離江灣機塲已遠，故被迫在南京機塲降落。兩架中航機均由中國機員駕駛，現仍停留南京，以待天氣放晴。周氏曾視察兩機，並向駕駛員致賀能在此危險氣候中飛行，技術高明，且與談論因何在如此惡劣之氣候下出發。兩機原定於明故宮機塲降落，因能見度低，故轉在軍用機塲下降。</p>

<h3>讀者諮詢</h3>
<p>（一）納妾續嗣</p>
<p>唐摩雲問鄙人中年乏嗣，於三十二年娶朱姓女爲妾，翌年即生一子，不幸於去年春夭殤，從此態度大變，初則以大小不和爲說詞，而久住母家，從此不回，去信亦不答復，請問：照上項情形，彼一去不返，是否違法？彼去後，余是否仍要擔負伊之生活費？萬不得己，可吾法律起訴？</p>
<p>〔朱亞揆律師答〕法律上並無妾之身份，祇能稱謂同居關係而已。君應善爲勸導，希冀言歸於好。如朱姓女仍不願回來，雖不負伊之生活費，但亦不能申請追償相當損失。</p>

<p>〔朱亞揆律師答〕（一）同居關係並不合法，如乙女堅主脫離而遭拒絕時，可請求法院裁判。（二）可，惟出走時除自有物外，不得私取其他物件。（三）可。（四）應依事實情形爲斷。（五）如並未私取自有物外之物，則當然下能成立罪行。</p>

<p>據悉：我對日易貨，本年首次運華日人絲六千箱，本於昨日即可到埠，後因氣候關係，未能進口，現該批人絲，已由日輪於昨日上午十時駛抵上海。又悉：中央信託局本左首次配售人絲，業已於本週一經代售會例會核定，准暫按照上年十二月份各業總配量之六分之一，先行配售，計核准絲織業六分之一，爲四百五十七箱零五包，織帶業六分之一，這三十箱零五包，結果絲織業申請者共二百零八家，配出東洋人絲三百廿二箱，配價仍爲二百七十七萬元，總値八億九千一百九十四萬元，但距核定數尙餘一百三十五箱零五包，又織帶業至今尙未有前往申請者，聞鼠因係一般廠商，均已於昨日起循舊例休業度歲，致需要量銳滅，故本月份對各業配售人絲數量，該局亦未有核定。</p>
<h3>總結賑期中　茶市交易淡</h3>
<p>農歷年底總結賬期，茶業亦下能例外，是以連日供求趨懈，交易减色，言其市勢，在執貨人心對於海外貿易前途尙抱樂觀下，乃亦鮮搖動之象，各式紅綠茶，行情均穩定不變，至干龍井，大方，苞種等各種內銷綠茶，自天津一帶去化，形若死灰以來，僅恃本街微有走銷，致過程並不活發，價格平中帶軟。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕目前歡美等國需要我國茶葉依然殷切，惟以售價高低懸殊，故出口異常黯淡，而茶葉中人，因資金擱淺，勢難長久支持，數度曾要求政府收購，俾資救濟，茲悉，刻下初步漸露面目，聞收購數額，的達六萬担光景，日來本市各茶行及茶葉公司，已將存茶數量及採製價格，彙呈當局，並悉茶業界方面，茶盼望當局能於日內即擬獲得貨款，以冀安渡陰歷年關云。</p>
<h3>央行竭力壓抑　金價略見頓挫</h3>
<p>烚赤昨仍遭央行管制所懾伏而稍疲，晨開三七一萬左右，高至三七三萬，即遭央行所壓迫，惟初時尙穩定於三七〇萬關邊，是以十時後，失行以三七〇萬之價，配給九二條，入後供給一再見强，買戶雖有抵抗，近午終吿屈服，降至三六七萬左右徘徊，午後即交曾破入三六五萬以下，隔日交易開出，又受大鈔傳說而激昂，高價達三七五萬，央行仍加壓迫而退至三七〇萬左右，較前收跌一萬五，飾金銀元均無變動，銀根尙平，息價仍在一角半左右。　外幣亦見平波，美鈔晨初暗市仍喊六千五至六千六，此價即難越過，午刻降至六千四左右掙扎，午後金價見升，稍見扳高，結果較前收尙跌一百五十元，港票初疲繼平，大勢仍在一二五〇元左右盤旋，結果與前收相彷彿，港匯昨一二二〇元及一二三〇元間，頗有成交。印匯一四七〇元至一四九〇元，英匯一九三〇〇〇元左右，兩者有行無市。</p>
<h3>英商紗廠申請　准許訂購外棉</h3>

<h3>配油漲價在醖釀中　原料步漲生產成本增高　新正停車工人照例休假</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據上海食油聯配處消息：處近因農產年關逼近，故將年關前各日應配之油，提前於本月十五日前配竣。惟近日來原有參加聯配之七家民營榨油廠，以停車及改組關係，僅大德新，大有餘，大昌新三家照當配給。故每日原定五百担之配售額，僅配三百担。不足之數，曾由該處主委張超，於日前晋謁吳市長，擬請國營沒廠補足之，吳市長已原則同意。昨日當由社會局糧食科吉科長請示吳市長後，與中國植物油廠洽妥，補配不足之油一千三百担。聞十五日各零售店已獲配油額，而尚未領到配油現貨者，將於日內由中國植物油廠直接通知配售。</p>
<p>又據本市榨油業同業公會某負責人語記者：近來榨汕原料，較食油騰漲爲速。現今食油之議價，尙係去年十一月底時施行。是時黃豆每担的二萬七千元，近市黃豆已漲至四萬元。且工繳方面，亦已漲起五成。此外再翻駁運費利息捐稅等項，豆油之成本價每祖已近十九萬元。現本會正計算生產成本中，俾便根據事實，向當局申請調整議價。據稱：目前元錫等地汕價，亦已達十八萬元。故如本市仍維舊價，本市配汕，勢將流向外埠。至各廠配油，每日仍維持五百担之數，此數將配至本月十八日爲止。農曆新正，各廠榨油工人，按照慣例，均將返里十日至十五日，故各廠或將有短時期之停車云。</p>
<h3>五百美元以下進口貨　免領許可證　如屬違禁品仍禁輸入　修正進出口貿易暫行辦法施行</h3>
<p>後所有進口旅客行李內携帶物品，除該辦法附表（四）所列禁止進口者外，暫准免騐輸入許可證，業經辦理在案。茲向江　闌稅務　探悉該司近　總統務司令，以依照輪入臨時管理委員會執行會擬定旅客行李中所應完稅之物件，屬於該辦法附表（二）及（三）（甲）（乙）兩項所列之物品，其總價值不超過美金五百元，或其同等價値者，母須領輸入許可證，惟來目香港澳門之旅客，則以港幣二百元爲限，其由外洋經香港轉船來華之旅客，可帶完稅物件，亦以總値不超過美金五百元，或其問等價値爲免稅之標準，自奉令“起一個月後實施。至附表（四）所列物品，應禁止輸入，仍按章辦理。茲悉海關奉令後，定一月三十日起實行云。</p>
<h3>原料齊步飛揚　保隊粉漲風熾烈</h3>
<p>原料市塲，以行商年關頭寸，均已軋好，故日來原料市價一致上漲，用戶以舊曆開年，更有激漲之勢，紛紛擬在年內扒進。保險粉，每祖已出五十萬關外，漂粉精，美貨昨市做價，每桶已在六十二三萬之間，按漂粉精上年一月間市價曾至七十餘萬元，迨後到貨頗多，每箱跌至十一二萬元，現又回復漲至上年斯時之價格。</p>
<h3>呢羢消息彙誌</h3>
<p>呢羢界與西服帮，鑒於高利貸之壓迫，講賬及倒閉者衆，彼此互有戒心，各種捐稅繁重，公私開繳浩大。吃本重，岡利微，存貨歷年減寡，俱有進退兩難之感。</p>
<p>（二）呢羢之進口洋行帮，前受政府配給外匯之困難，請求許可證之艱苦，後受本市紡織呢絨廠商之向政府禀呈禁止呢絨進口之打擊，短期內不能定到，大半皆隱憂重重。</p>
<p>（三）實地調查呢羢同業之各店號，除大範圍，大資本家，與廠方有密切聯絡及有特殊勢力關係者，默未表示外，其餘門莊與字號及西服帮等，全部反對呢羢禁止進口，其理由除生產花色不全外，廠方圖利頗占優厚，分配不均，行情勢必大漲特漲，非圈內人物，普通字號店舖均須受大批發戶之間接支配，因而不能營業者必多云。</p>
<h3>閏內五金缺乏　東北供應甚多</h3>

<h3>米市銷路清淡　麪粉呆滯生油活潑</h3>
<p>本市南北共到四千五六百石，來源雖稀，綠銀根軋緊，消胃依然淸懈，粳米北市早堅午疲，南市形趨軟化，結果均成萎疲之勢，秈米供求兩少，仍乏榮辱，白元陰元，去化尙殷，回漲一二千元，黃豆本街汕廠進胃接連，東北大豆及長江黃豆挺升三五百元，惟杜豆仍居平庸，荼豆高貨南洋續辦，市勢堅穩，赤豆仍無上落，豇豆亦少出入，芝蔴去化下爽，市形軟化而少神，生仁年關需用，本街互相購納，實銷頗旺，回漲二三千元，豆餅汕厦交易轉淡，明定暗疲，麵粉萎靡下振，洋粉統粉一致下挫五六百元，雜牌粉亦頗呆滯，油市略有參差，桶生汕去化活潑，盤漲一二千元，簍生汕平平，淸油彷彿，惟小車蔴汕依然俏俐，續漲三五千元，再見新高價，收市植物汕廠售出生汕淸汕甚多，形勢帶平。</p>

<h3>運用鲜潔的血輸　鑄造新江蘇</h3>
<p>— 鎭江二日快訉　本報記者扣香林</p>
<p>江蘇，它好比是久病初愈的一個患者，不僅需要積極的治際，去施用手術，更需要的是在調理後的補養問題。蘇北共軍正猛烈的燃燒了殘酷的火把，在開始擴大所謂「解放區」運動，幾個月來，由於我們蘇北廣大民衆的一致要求積極還鄕，而几要積極地整理那被共軍破壞殆盡的幾十萬畝肥沃的農村，經過國軍開始向衛反擊後，共軍經不起一擊，運河綫上的高寳淮工放棄了，通榆綫上重要据點放棄了，漣臯相繼內鬨又放棄了，這好像冬天落葉般的凋零，至此，蘇北局勢澄淸的遠景，已照耀在我們的眼前。</p>
<p>省幹訓團　設轉業軍訓班</p>
<p>江蘇省，幹訓團，爲了把握這個遠景，而期待着現實的來臨，於十二月一日，在建立新時代新江蘇新幹部新任務四大原則和客觀的要求下，設立了轉業軍官訓練班，參加受訓約有無鍚第十七軍官總隊選拔過來的八百十五人，省保安司令部八十三人，及該團編餘官佐三十七人，計共九百三十五人，這一批經過了八年浴血抗戰的餘生，毫不猶豫地步入省幹訓團接受轉業訓練，希望團結三百萬江蘇同胞，恢復並建設光輝燦爛的新江蘇。</p>
<p>日子一天天的過去，十天，二十天，鎭江社會裏依然平靜得像一池死水，馬路上偶然看見三兩位穿着士兵服裝的斯文人物，有的還戴上眼鏡，忽忙的踏進書坊或百貨商店選買了他們要買的東西，又忽忙地走了回去，多嘴的店夥，在開始議論了，我看這準是上次給我們歡迎來的轉業軍官」，「你怎麼知道呢」？「我看你的眼睛簡直不大關用，他們穿着士兵的服裝，但普遍的士兵有這樣整齊嗎，他們有禮貌，而比很客氣，我一看就知道他們是軍官」，「軍官」官爲什麼要穿士兵服裝，而又不掛佩領章呢」？你眞是傻瓜，他們是在受訓啊；他們是學員」這是僅有的微波，鎭江人好像早已忘記了轉業軍官的存在。</p>
<p>在十二月廿四日的下午，每一家報館和駐鎭的京滬記者，都接到了省幹訓團的請柬，上面說明該團的轉業軍官因受省會各界的熱烈歡迎和盛意帮助，爲表示感謝起見，特定二十六茶會招待。</p>
<p>那天，毛雨霏霏的一個下午，記者們坐了迎接的汽車直向東門外三十五標出發，訓練國大門口掛了一幅紅綢軟匾，寫着頗爲精美的藝術字「歡迎省會各界及新聞界蒞團指導」，牆壁上貼滿了色彩鮮明的歡迎標語，車子在大禮堂前停下了，十幾位掛着紅綢標帶的轉業軍官，如迎貴賓似地舉起了手，將記者們引導至他們的中山室，室內佈置得異常雅潔，三排桌子排成一個瘦長的「山」字形，主席台作了山字的底劃，紅藍白三色的台布，配上素雅的盆花，每個座位的面前，用紙袋封着茶點一包，袋內還有一張巧小的傳單包着四枝馬立斯香烟，傳單上是一篇簡潔而熱烈的歡迎詞，你能說軍官們是老粗嗎？他們竟這樣的細心，兩點一刻，客到齊了，一百多位西裝，軍裝，中山裝，長袍大褂，眞是「軍民人等」一應皆有。</p>
<p>衛國干城　將成建國棟樑</p>
<p>茶會開始了，沒有任何儀式，一位年輕軍官曹自強作了臨時主席，致了明朗而熱情的歡迎詞，並道出他們的願望：「我們要繼承抗戰精神，建設新江蘇，完成建國大業」，雖沒有咬文嚼字掉書袋，態度却文雅得像個學者，接着是敎育長許聞天致詞，他報吿了轉業訓練的籌備及訓練經過，他保證這批轉業軍官不會使政府和社會人士失望，「戰時他們是衛國的干城，平時他們一定是建國的棟樑」。</p>
<p>繼續的是轉業軍官的代表們左治人，孫哲君，開始報吿了，他們設身處地的吿訴大家：「政府有什麼虧待我們呢，琉血流汗爭取民族生存，這是中華男兒的神聖使命，有動員必定有復員，部隊整編了，政府給我們組織了軍官隊，照樣發着薪餉，設立訓練機關，敎給我們轉業技能，我們只有感激，只有興奮」，「我們希望社會多給我們帮助和鼓勵」，接着是來賓致詞，最後記者也特別愛好講話，「抗戰時我們在戰地見面，今後我們在建國道上同行」，茶點吃了，暮色漸漸的籠罩着大地，在毛雨霏霏中，我們仍乘原車，回到各自的窩巢。</p>
<p>三十五標　孕育新的幹部</p>
<p>三十五標是個值得追懷的聖地，在那裏正孕育着將出發江蘇各縣做建設新江蘇搖籃的幹部，記者於决日特　獨作了一次極詳盡的參觀和訪問，謹特報道如次：</p>
<p>踏進了大門是一片大操塲，有籃球之類的運動設備，四週建築了二十多座白粉墻的茅草屋子，向南走出那個大墻圈，另有一個土圍子，裏面也有十多座白墻茅舍，這一批復員軍官，就活躍在這兩個牆圈子內。</p>
<p>他們這一批分屬在民政，財政，建設，社會，田糧，會訂，衛生，地政，保安，防空等十個班內，凡是省縣行政部門，除掉敎育以外，幾乎各部門都有一個班，人數最多的是保安班計二百五十一人，最少的是衛生行政班，僅二十餘人，各種功課複雜到無法計算，從民意機構到禁烟禁毒，從國家財政到細菌消毒，從河海工程到園藝培植，……幾乎是社會科學與自然科學的集大成，全部講師大都均由省府各廳處主管長官或京滬等地的名流學者。</p>
<p>一張簡表　看出緊張生活</p>
<p>這裏是他們的一張生活時間表，早晨六點鐘起身，六點半集合升旗，早操還有二十分鐘精神講話，七點十分早餐，八點至十二點，是四堂正課，每堂五十分鐘，課與課間，只有十分鐘點休息，十二點十分午膳，下午一點至四點是三堂正課，四點至五點是課外活動，或小組討論等制式活動，六點十分晚膳，六點三十分至八點二十分自修，於是晚間九點就寢，就是說，從早晨六點到一晚間九點，時時刻刻在過着緊張一的生活。</p>
<p>這樣緊張的生活，他們過得了嗎？回答是肯定，非特過得了，而且連十分二十分鐘的休息時間，他們還在找事做，只要天不落雨雪，一到下課時間，籃球足球羽毛球決不會有片刻休止，中山室的康樂組和文化組更是他們的快樂園地，乒乓球打到一半，上課鐘響了，於是放下球拍「二三」「記好下課再來」，棋子下了幾着，就忙着去上課，他會招呼管理員，「同志，請你不要將棋子弄亂，我們下課後還着呢」，二十多份報紙，經常的圍着數十人在看。</p>
<p>「皮簧」是最受歡迎的玩意，一位平劇指導員往往被拉得走頭無路，但他有辦法，他採用陶行知先生的「小先生制」自修課比較自由，一到晚上，中山室的京班鑼鼓打得鏗鏘八答」京胡三弦很少住聲，「拉給我唱，西皮倒板」，生旦凈墨丑，色色俱全，他們排着隊等唱。</p>
<p>訓導工作　不許片刻靜止</p>
<p>訓導先生們頂會打算盤，他們像馬廐裏的猴子，不肯讓人有片刻的靜止，他們的主張是「緊張不足，就是輕鬆，他們一個月分成四個中心訓練週，第一週是組織週，除分班編隊等組織外，又組織了各項球隊，書報閱覽室，音樂戲劇組，以及各項競賽單位，而且還帮助轉業軍官們組成了同學聯誼會，這些名目，都是課餘時間進行的成功，第二週是力行週，所有組織都在按照計劃加緊活動，第三週是競賽週，錯綜複雜的競賽場面展開了，禮拜一升旗後，就開始了拔河比賽，每組二十人掛上紅黃榜帶，陣綫分明，銀角一聲，雙方角鬥，拉拉隊在旁助陣，「用力啊！哼！哈！用勁啊，杭唷」：一分鐘兩分鐘，雙方堅持不下，角鬥者拉得面紅耳赤，助威者，喊得力竭聲嘶，忽然一位仁兄從人叢中喊了一聲「殺」，立刻人們的臉色嚴肅起來，筋肉緊張起來：「殺」「殺啊」，聲震霄漢，眼睛裏冒火，瘋狂地喊「殺」，他們嘗味着當年的殺敵生活，「同學們：這是在拔河，這不是戰塲，爲什麼喊殺」？「是啊，這不是戰塲」，「哈哈！眞是熱昏」，一陣轟笑，人們恢復了理響，憤賽者笑得彎下了腰骨，銀角再　，決定第一塲的勝負，整整一星期，人們在忙着競賽車輪戰的籃球比賽，經常是第四中隊優勝，原來他們隊上有兩位老選手，文運　是湖南醴陵區的籃球代表，張鴻俊却是江蘇省運動會的第一流選手，都曾上過大塲面，顯過身手，他們覺得團內比賽不够過癮，曾寫信到江蘇醫政學院去挑戰，但回信說功課太忙，異日領敎云云。乒乓球賽，嘶殺了一個星期，最後是莊晏一孫同學第一，他的戰略是一個「忍」字，逆來順受，應戰而不挑戰，深得以柔克剛的三昧。</p>
<p>小組討論　紀錄厚一尺餘</p>
<p>小組討論會也舉行了兩次，因為房屋和指導人員不够分配，於是分成三十六小組，在一個題目內討論「常識與專門技能」的問題，一位同學說「我國官塲一向只注意通才，而忽略了專才，眞正的治水專家和建築家，却被看作優使而以小吏視之，這種風氣，現在並未終了，譬如導淮委員會，黃河水利委員會，……我認為……」「主席，我有點意見，補充一下，歐美各國憑了他們的科學，和精密分工，他們生活得比我們好，在戰爭中，我們認識了人家的優點，但我們的行政人員仍在憑常識處理事務，這樣下去，我們只會更加落後，我們必須要認識科學，重視專門技能，才能免除政府無靈，法律不可憑的弱點」，「我認為歐美國家在進步，整個世界在進步，不論是否願意，中國也必須進步進步到科學化，專門化，否則讓人家拉著鼻子數　，弄得和印度一樣，那就糟了，我　得行政人員，固然應有豐富的常　，尤須有專門技能」。「是的，世界在進步，在專門化，中國也必然如此，如果我們不能進步，不能在專門化，那我們就會落伍下來」……這是三十六份之一中的很小的一部門，全部小組討論會的紀錄有一尺多厚。</p>
<p>每週禮拜六晚上都有一次同樂會，在大禮堂舉行，這一批轉業軍官什麼玩意都且備，可以免鏗鏘激昂的山東大鼓，也可以是娓尾　人的蘇州彈詞，刀槍劍戟，拳技角力，梵亞林口琴，英文歌曲，色色俱全，最大衆化的還是平劇，團內備有鑼鼓紘子等塲面，只要借到一副行頭龍套，他們可以演出各種戲，他們喜歡把別　和　　搬在一起扮演，他們同情苦難的王費釧，但是不要緊，人總是要回來的，大舞台的幾位女角，曾披　聘過兩次，只是話劇演不起來，因爲時間太短了，而且課務緊迫，無暇排練，每一個禮拜六，人們都懷着小孩子過新年的喜悅心情，踏進大禮堂，痛快地消磨兩個鐘頭到四個鐘頭　一個月的緊張訓練，已於十二月廿八日完畢，現在，他們正忙着分發實習。分發地區及工作部門，大都以各人的能力和志願爲標準。省府各廳處局以及大江南北的縣級機構，將加進這一批鮮潔的血輪。他們在喊着：「我們要繼承抗戰精鉀，，建設新江蘇，完成建國大業」。</p>

<h3>淮南鐵路踏勘</h3>
<p>— 蕪湖五日訊　本報特派員康風</p>
<p>民國十九年一溝通皖境淮河與長江二百餘公里平原的淮南鐵路在南京國民政府　設委員會裹設計了方案，經過六年的測線，興工·築基·舖軌·在民國廿五年嘖着黑煙的火車頭拖着列車開始行駛在江淮平原上，運載米毅·雜種·牲畜·棉花·布匹·百貨以及旅客了。這鐵路資本爲六百萬元，起點是長江北岸蕪湖斜對江的裕溪口站，終點爲淮河南岸田家庵站，這條鐵路定名爲淮南。江淮之間富庶的巢湖，稻倉區以及淮河流域的雜糧區，都用這條鐵路的完成而獲得了較低的出口費用。使得江淮間四萬平方公里的經濟基礎得以鞏固與提高。</p>
<p>僅僅一年餘，這條鐵路在民國廿六年冬就因成為對日本抗戰的戰地而自動破壞了。常初撤退破壞的辛酸，如今幾個淮南鐵路的元老胡衛中，寗樹藩副局長等，都能歷歷道來，但這都已成爲永久的陳跡。當卅四年冬吳鏡淸局長率領胡衛中等幾位接收委員來接收這條鐵路時，八年不見的鐵路，除了九龍崗路局還保持原先容貌外，連路綫都改了道。</p>
<p>變成了田蚌支線</p>
<p>日本人佔領淮南鐵路以後，因爲這條鐵路當初建築動機是爲了暢輸大通與淮南兩公司煤礦的煤產，而這二個煤礦沒有來得及澈底破壞，日本人正需要煤用之際，就決定使用道條鐵路作爲運煤專綫，當初路綫由田家庵到裕溪口固然煤斤可以運到長江口岸再轉銷上游安慶，九江，甚至武漢，但貫通江淮流域豐盛的糧運却也是主要的築路因素。日本人軍事第一，汽油產量及輸入旣不能供應海軍船隻需用，對日本交通及長江上日本用煤的船艦日多，淮南煤需就成爲日軍軍用工礦中的重要據點，因此運煤出去的路綫，於其暴露在二百公里中國游擊隊控制的江淮平原上，不如在水家湖站轉灣向東北，與淮河平行奔向津浦鐵路重站蚌埠，日本人說做就做，一條由田家庵經水家湖到蚌埠的八十八公里，田蚌支綫就成爲日本人控制下的新淮南，作用是成天不斷的運煤，滾滾的黑色列車去接濟日艦去轟擊日本人所欲毀滅的長江流域，不屈服鄉村。</p>
<p>淮南新貌</p>
<p>吳鏡淸局長來接收這僅有八十八公里鐵路時，能以通行的僅有田家庵至水家湖二十八公里這一段，寗樹藩副局長說到這段鐵路，自己也好笑一個完整的淮南鐵路局的機構所管有的鐵路僅僅是二十八公里。這一羣交通幹部在本年五個月中千方百計修復了水家湖到蚌埠的六十公里，六月一日，這一段日本人築通復經破壞的路基，又舖了鐵軌行車了。從茲以後，每天田家菴開出客貨混合列車二班，煤車二列去蚌埠，同樣的二班客貨混合列車由蚌埠開來。二班空煤車也急急忙忙趕到裝煤出去。</p>
<p>我在水家湖車站重賭了淮南鐵路的今貌，這個車站所在地只有一邊月台，站房是日本人建築的矮木屋，我看到黃重仁站長拿了紅綠旗站在月合上協助指揮，一列田家菴駛蚌埠的客貨列車進站，我從頭數到尾，二等客車一節，三等客車一節，十五噸鐵皮車廂十二節，裹面是四等搭客與鷄鴨，煙　，棉花，雜糧等商貨，最後爲十二節三十噸裝煤的敞車，沉重的二十六輛的長列車！</p>
<p>十來分鐘客貨落站上車後，我看到這列車吼着奔行去蚌埠了，這是好年光的標誌，雖然淮河流域今年淹死了許多了，冲毀了許多房屋，但這段與淮河平行八十八公里的「鐵造淮河」却在暢輸一批求活路的淮河上的好百姓！　淮南鐵路目前有火車頭十五輛，客貨煤車二百餘輛，每天在鐵路上奔馳的火車頭八輛，我在水家湖站所見的那一趟客貨混合列車一共有二十六輛車廂，每天在鐵路上運煤，貨，客人的車廂總在百五十輛以上，以此計算，淮南鐵路的交通工具使用率，在表面上約在百分之六十上下。</p>
<p>實際上那些不曾行駛的火車頭與車廂，很本就是有毛病的，所以淮南鐵路機車廠，就有一份做不完的工作要去做，而况在路上行駛的火車經過了一定時間，要來檢查出了毛病要來修理。</p>
<p>這機車廠設在路局所在地九龍崗，與九龍崗車站隔着鐵軌相對，廠長柳新民與路局機務處長陸鳳山都曾經在很多其他鐵路機車廠閱歷過。這個廠有職員五十名，工人四百七十六人，進入機廠就爲轉動車床的皮帶流走景象，以及工人作工的敲擊鋼鐵聲所迷。</p>
<p>寗樹藩副局長引着我細去看每一個部份，可是一個不曾花很多時光精力在機械工作上的人一下子不會能吸收得住這五光十色形象而記牢的，不過經過這訪决問，我到懂得了一些關於機車的常識，譬如說一個完整的火車頭，分成鍋爐部與煤水車二部份，機車廠中就有一輛機車的鍋爐部火箱板因經久用太薄了，而且有朽爛處，這輛機車就駛回來挖補火箱板，以免鍋爐爆炸，而致火車停在路上阻塞川流不息的交通，機務處在全線各站都有機工隨時注意檢查機車，以及客貨車機件，一個細心旅客會在他所乘的列車進出車站時發現有些滿身油汚的工人，在列車旁彎身細看車下，似在尋找什麼重要東西，那就是機務處的人在爲旅客及行車安全檢查輪軸。</p>
<p>機車的煤火車水櫃里可注滿十噸水，這十噸水只能供應行車八十公里的消耗，行完了八十公里，必需在設有水塔的車站停軍加水以便續行。</p>
<p>火車交通所以能不出事，與鐵路局對火車的檢修制度執行嚴密有絕對關係，汽車交通的拋錨現象所以普遍，就是汽車交通行政中沒有執行嚴密的檢查修理制度，淮南鐵路目前雖是一條內地的短程運煤專用路，但是牠從通車以來從沒出過事，行車是絕對守時，這已經充份表現了現代企業的業務精神：九能崗機車廠處機務處的動工，就是牠的主因！</p>
<p>九龍　機廠接收時是一片廢鐵垃圾堆，廠棚是一室空架子，先修屋頂，再用水門汀舖築廠地以及修車問的空槽，廠地修好今年四月就能做客貨車修造及零星工作，在十月，機車可以入廠大修了，但目前還缺一件最重要的機件設備，就是五十噸的大吊車，淮南鐵路局渴望行總能撥一部大吊車供他們應用，否則他們修理一部機車的輪軸部份時，把鍋爐，車架，吊起來就因用人力而耗時太久，在工效來講旣不配合，又不經濟。</p>
<p>日本人所棄留的廢料經機廠應用，改造成客車六部，貨車二十部，窮國家的窮辦法，你坐在廢料作成的客車上決不會想到這是機廠人手的傑作，我親眼看見技工們在對一輛客車噴漆，又是新車一輛落成了。</p>
<p>翻砂間有一隻一噸容量的熔鐵爐，還在準備建一隻三噸熔爐，機車部份零件都由這兒鑄出供用，火車方面已入於純國貨時代，而無需像鋼軌橋樑那麼仰求於人了。</p>
<p>蘇北國軍最前線指揮所一景（本報泰縣記者凌松壽攝）</p>
<h3>新淮南的展望</h3>
<p>淮南鐵路本身不甘心只做八十八公里田蚌綫上運煤工作，運煤去燃亮南京光明，無錫光明，上海溫暖，淮南鐵路已能勝任，而有餘力，欲求鐵路在江淮地區整個經濟上作貢獻！</p>
<p>淮南舊路綫由水家湖到裕溪口這二百十公里的復軌是淮南鐵路第一步的最切近之夢。每個淮南礦路員工都在想着有一天，這條鐵路的火車能以奔馳到合肥，到巢縣，終於停息在滾滾的揚子江畔裕溪口，那就是淮南鐵路展其所長的時候！</p>
<p>淮南鐵路公務處正在做舊路復軌的工作，江西籍的李經畬處長經手造過黔桂鐵路那些山地的穿山跨谷艱難工程都經過來了，淮南路復軌，是件閉眼可做好的事，所以李處長對於復軌工程毫無顧慮，只渴望復軌所需的器材早日撥給。</p>
<p>早在半年以來，淮南鐵路沿綫四座鐵橋的橋墩即已用鋼骨水泥築好，巢湖畔最長的柘臯河鐵橋一百十公尺長，十九孔的橋墩，也早築好，交通部亦已答應撥發八十一億元工程費，其中重建裕溪口碼頭費約需五億元，首先動工的也就是這個碼頭，因爲美軍剩餘物資裏的鐵軌橋樑器材一到，裕溪口立刻要拿碼頭來接卸這些用大輪船裝來的器材。</p>
<p>李經畬處長描繪不久的淮南鐵路復軌工程：</p>
<p>「我們打算在材料一到，立即分在三地舖戰，由上海經京滬路津浦路運來材料轉淮南路到水家湖站向合肥舖築，由上海經長江水運把材料送到蕪湖對江裕溪口，向菓縣舖築，再以小輪木船由裕溪口把材料運支菓縣，在菓縣向合肥舖築，這麼三點同時動工，每點打算日舖五公里鐵路，共爲十五公里，則二百十公里只需十五天就可全綫接軌，當然，架設四座鐵橋的時間花費要多些，而運器材到施工地點又帶更長的時間，我們的計劃是保證在領到材料六個月之內完全通車。</p>
<p>淮南鐵路第二步夢想是使得淮南鐵路在距裕溪口七公里的沈家巷站折轉而南奔通達蕪湖正對江二壩，由沈家巷到裕溪口只七公里，但到二壩要十八公里，爲什麼將來淮南終點要改向二壩呢？讀者必需注意裕溪口對蕪湖的水距斜隔長江約有十五公里之　，而二壩正好在蕪湖平行的長江北岸，只有二公里水距，猶如浦口隔長江正對南京的下關。</p>
<p>這條十八公里的改綫工程由於沈家巷到二壩是幾乎平行於長江水流，所以路基高度必需超過民國廿年水災時的長江水位六公尺以上，方能保證大水時仍可能車。現在這條未來新線已經測騐完成，全線所經十八公里地區的地勢都在民廿年高水位以上，故將來路基塡土工程祇需塡高五公尺即可，這塡土工程及這一段新路　一座跨越槽運河大橋（十二公尺高，一百八十公尺寬，）工程却很大。預計這短短的新道花費工款不會很少，但交通體系常顧到永久的利益而肯破費一時的巨資，所以這段新線修建也勢在必行</p>
<p>二壩新綫成後，由二壩到蕪湖直航長江爲一·三公里的近距，斜航爲二一公里的水路，到蕪湖江邊的在蕪湖叉磯山醫院上首一點地方登陸，再由登陸處築一條二公里長支綫接通江南鐵路蕪湖江邊車站，那麼淮南江南津浦的聯運就可以貫通無阻，像南京浦口間的澄平號輪渡運客，長江號輪渡運火車的美事，也就可以在蕪湖二壩　扮演了。</p>
<p>寗樹藩說到復軌以後的淮南鐵路當然又有一番餘力可以爲安徽交通再盡點力，譬如現在行駛水家湖到合肥，以及合肥到裕溪口鐵路路基上的汽車，就可以改駛合肥六安綫，以便皖西大別山茶園的茶銷得一方便州路，由田家庵到壽縣也可以行駛汽車，田家庵沿淮河到鳳台，正陽關，仍可以行駛小輪來使得淮河流域雜糧可以與淮南鐵路接運向蕪湖或蚌埠浦口輸出。</p>
<p>淮南鐵路到那個時候可以直正發揮牠運轉江淮之間的偉力，像一匹充沛精力的鐵馬，爲江淮平原的經濟向上而奔馳不停！</p>
<h3>越南行脚</h3>
<p>— 一月一日航訊　潔蓀寄自河內</p>
<p>最近，高綿革命黨曾經殺死了幾個法國傳敎士，於是，法軍一進了馬德望，寺廟裏的僧侶，有幾個就被他們開了「頭彩」，以爲報復，屍體橫陳，血迹殷然。牆壁上到處有高綿革命黨人寫就的中文，高綿文，暹文，英文，法文，的標語：「侵略者的軍隊不受歡迎」，「帝國主義者是弱小民族的公敵」，和道事實做一個相比的對照。</p>
<p>在四府的華僑，數達二十萬人，馬德望幾佔其半。三分之二已經移入暹境，除了不動產外，重要財物也隨之遷移入於暹羅領土，尙留其地的，常常被搶掠，被殘殺。法方一再聲明，切實負責保護，却覓採取什麼有效的指置。我國駐西貢總領事館曾派許副領事到馬德望去向法方交涉，而交涉之後，也就沒有下文。</p>
<p>一到夜晚，居民　伏屋內，不敢一步或離，法兵也都瑟縮在營，不敢外出，疏密的槌聲，和着遠遠的犬吠聲，使人聽了，有如處身於荒村絕域，更增中了恐怖和蕭肅之恐。</p>
<p>從四府到受谷和西貢的陸上交通，已經完全斷絕。在參觀接收典禮後，我訪駐四府法政府代表戴仲基愛將軍，蒙他予以種種便利，始得乘法軍用機離馬德望而住金邊。</p>
<p>金邊是高綿的都城。當天正是高綿王施亞努的誕辰，西貢方面的法方要員和我國駐西貢總領事伊鳳藻等都來致賀，　　排塲，熱閙非凡。居然是一片昇平景　。而四郊多壘，人心惶惶，華僑富商，早多遷往西貢了。</p>
<p>高綿王之下，首相大臣之類，應有盡有，眞可以說是麻雀雖小，五臟俱全了。在一個招待會上，我得以和高綿王做一席之談，提及法越關係的現勢和胡志明在越南爭取獨立過程中的地位，他不置一詞，他唯滿口盛讚他在巴黎的時候，法國給予他的優渥待遇；他並且强調的說，四府土地之得以收回，完全是法國接受他的請求的結果。法國導演手法可謂相當高妙，施亞努的扮做也還算得逼眞。</p>
<p>在西貢市與湄公河上</p>
<p>盛典旣畢，佳賓皆散，我也就離去金邊。從金邊到西貢的公路尚可通車。但是，越南人抗法意志非常堅決，往往棄田園，携妻兒深入內地，而後捨身奮鬥。凡是公路沿綫以及法國所能到達的地方，十屋九空。百里不見人烟。傾覆於路旁的車輛，觸目皆是；法兵中伏傷亡，時有所聞；西貢近郊，房舍也多成爲焦土。　這一公路綫是屬於茾苴省境。境內的豐田市，如陵市，鳳合市，徑共市，在日本投降的初期，受着英印軍的燒殺搶掠，繼又有法越部隊的爭戰，數萬僑胞，尙在顚沛流連之中，朝不保夕，人人自危，情形異常悽慘。</p>
<p>半年之內，我三到西貢。它此時雖然還是披着商埠的外衣，而事實上，它儼然是一個大兵營了。湄公河中，砲艦，運輸艦，航空母艦，艨艟蔽港。在市區，軍用車來往奔馳，絡繹不絕；坦克車，鐵甲車，常常出現示威；飛機也不時盤旋空中。法兵橫衝直撞，儼然是以征服者自居。　西貢市區遼闊，商業以六英里外的堤岸爲最發達。華僑二十萬人，堤岸就是純粹的華僑商業區。但是，苛例重重，法方又在施行經濟統判政策，市面很受影響。不過，在同時，却有華僑花了三千萬元越幣建造了一家新金山娛樂塲，內有遠東最大的舞塲，有可與東方的蒙特卡羅的澳門相媲美的賭塲。烟館林立，妓院也觸目皆是。糜爛無恥，帝國主義者一向是最善利用這些來麻醉殖民地的人民的。</p>
<p>國駐越南的許多重地機關都設在西貢；「南　共和國臨時政府」成立後，並且以西貢爲首都。自從法越局勢緊急，法殖民部長慕特，遠東軍總司令華尾，駐越南高級專員達尙禮安相繼到西貢之後，便就下令，每晚十時至翌晨七時爲戒嚴時間。在戒嚴時間內，街上行人絕迹，居民常會被武裝人員破扉而入，姦淫，搶掠，無所不爲。遭受禍害最大的就是我們華僑。我國駐西貢總領事館接受報吿，案卷何止盈尺。我曾據此以問尹總領事鳳藻，交涉的結果如何，以及法方有吾制止此類事件的發生的誠意，他只簡單的說：「仍然未可樂觀。」也可交涉這些案件是如何的辣手了。</p>
<p>在西貢三天，我獲得法方的同意，乘軍用機到海防。據同行的法軍官對我說，飛機降落的吉比機塲，在十一月十九日法越初起的時候，曾經被越盟軍隊佔領，到了二十七日始由法軍官戴波里埃上校率領降落傘部隊，配合驅逐機隊及地上之裝甲兵團參加作戰後，得很歸法軍控制。彈壳滿地，機庫彈痕纍纍，可以窺見當時作戰的劇烈。</p>
<p>在市區的每一條街道和湄公河沿岸一帶，法軍到處裝置砲位，據地而守。法艦也脫卸砲衣，對準市區。重要建築物多都破壞，民房泰半被燬，到處斷垣殘壁，餘燼未熄。見不到一個行人，只有坦克車在來往梭巡。　永電廠尙未修復，一到夜晚，全市陷入黑暗世界。越盟軍隊不時向市區集中砲擊，潛伏市區的越盟軍隊則到處縱火鳴槍以相呼應。恐怖的氣氛，令人毛骨悚然。</p>
<p>海防小駐</p>
<p>衝突事件發生後，越盟委員會發表宣言，呼籲越民族沈着，團結，速做有效之凖備。越南報紙並對達尙禮安做劇烈之抨擊。「民族」報稱：「渠爲法越民族團結之破壞者。」結論稱「達尙禮安重返越南，則越人之血必將再流無疑」。</p>
<p>據官方發表華僑損失統計：死者五十九人，傷者五十一人，被捕者一百九十三人，失踪者五百〇二人。財產損失：計房屋全燬者二十三間，部份燬壞者五十九間，外加貨物等損失總額爲越幣二千五百萬元然據觀察所得，生命和財產的損失，恐皆不僅止此。</p>
<p>海防本有華僑八萬人，從毗鄰各地集中到海防來的也在兩千人以上了，大家都焦急得有如熟鍋上的螞蟻。去留俱非，朝不保夕，個中苦况，血海斑斑，實不是親歷者所能想像！</p>
<p>在海防兩天，我設法領到一張越盟方面的通行證，在熹徵的朝晨，我進入了越盟軍隊的防區。因爲他們事先接得通知，我一到臨，便有越南靑年五名，三男兩女，武裝護送，同我深入內地。</p>
<p>鐵道，公路都被破壞，沿綫居民，都在加緊建築防禦工事，同時，也在加緊施行疏散。我親眼看見，他們連僅有的床舖，門板，就是拉車的也將其做爲唯一財產的車子獻出，以做障礙物之用。情緒的悲壯熱烈，可泣可歌，令人感動。</p>

<h3>一個被忽略的婦科病　白帶的眞相</h3>
<p>— 成言嘉</p>
<p>提起白帶，一般人都認為是婦女應有的事，尤其是結了婚的婦女，十個中九個是有白帶的，因此是不必介意的，另外一些人認為白帶是一種最普通最經的婦女病，不必去請敎醫生，祗要用朋友介紹的或是廣吿上宣傳的藥物就可以立即痊愈了，其實這二種觀念都是錯誤的，白帶是一種由子宮頸及陰道中流出來的白色分泌，這種分泌有時祗是生理的現象，好像在月經前期或受孕期中，因內分泌的不平衡或是生理機能的增强，分泌也競增多了，但是在很多時候白帶是病理的現象。白帶本身不能稱為一種病而却長許多締科病的症狀。現在把幾種便白帶增多的普通病症講一講。（本篇僅限於陰道及子宮頸的範圍）在未講之前，我們先應當知道陰道及子宮頸的生理組織。</p>
<p>陰道的表面有一層粘膜，這層粘膜和皮膚相似是一種複層鱗狀細胞組成的，陰道中並無腺組織，所以它的分泌實是從子宮頸及子富中出來的，當卵巢作用活動時期——自發育期至停經期—陰這中的化學反應是弱酸性的（PH4—5．5）這種弱酸性是因為一種製酸菌名呌Doderlein＇sBacillus與陰道表皮細胞中的肝　粉起發酵作用而產生乳酸而起的；酸性强的程度適足以阻止一般細菌的生長及繁殖，因為一般細菌都不宜在酸性中生存的，所以維持PH4—5．5的酸度是非常重要的。那末怎樣才能繼續不斷地維持弱酸呢？原來乳酸的多少是依據表皮細胞中的肝澱粉多少而定的，表皮細胞中的肝澱粉又要靠卵巢中求偶性內分泌的活躍而增多的；所以在發育期前和停經後因求偶發生性內分泌减少肝澱粉也减少，陰道的反應由弱酸而變成鹹性，在這種時期如有外界細菌侵人陰道就很容易發炎的。</p>
<p>子宮頸好像是一條海峽，它溝通陰道與子宮，近陰道部份的粘膜仍是複層鱗狀細胞組成的，但管內的粘膜却是單層的管狀細胞組成的，子宮頸有很多的腺，腺管都向表面開放，因此可把分泌物排洩到陰道中，這種分泌是無色鹹性的粘液，平常把子宮頸管堵塞，因此陰這中的東西，不容易侵入子宮腔內。</p>
<p>明瞭了陰道及子宮頸的生理組織之後，我們就可以分別地來談使白帶增多的幾種主要的病症了。</p>
<p>（一）女陰陰道炎</p>
<p>女孩子在發育以前流白帶大半是病理的，原因是由於淋菌或化膿菌傳染入陰道內而起的，傳染的方法不外直接接觸到衣服浴中等傳染物，或由於手指的傳染甚至於由不正當的性行為所致。症狀是陰唇紅鱸，處女膜及陰道中流出粘性膿狀白帶，如將分泌物用顯微鏡檢查或細菌培養即可知道確係何種細菌。浩療的方法不外用化學療法如消治龍地亞凈或配尼西林等，局部灌洗以及注射求偶發生性內分泌劑。至於用內分泌治療的原理在上面生理段中已講過是增强乳酸的產生及使陰道表皮細胞變厚，這樣可以加强對細菌的抵抗力，治療的結果大多是滿意的。</p>
<p>（二）老年陰道炎</p>
<p>老年陰道炎，顧名思義，當然是老年婦女生的；平常總在停經之後，卵巢活動力减少，求偶發生性內分泌逐漸停止，陰道中的粘膜亦退化，表皮减薄，因此非但在組織上對於外界的細菌抵抗力薄弱，並且陰道中分泌的化學反應也因求偶發生性內分泌减少的關係，乳酸產量大减而變為鹹性，細菌因此繁殖而形成發炎，症狀是陰道彌漫地紅腫白帶大量增加，不過是漿液膿狀的。治療的方法是局部用溫水或輕消毒劑灌洗同時注射求偶發生性內分泌，其原理和治療兒童陰道炎相似，所以結果是非常顯著地奏效的。</p>
<p>（三）陰道商虫病</p>
<p>婦女在生育時期，因為求偶發生性內分泌活動的緣故，除了一種呌滴虫病的之外是不容易得陰道炎的，那末什麼呌滴虫呢？滴虫是一種鞭毛原虫，在顯微鏡下可見，形如一梨，外圈有毛，活動異常，傳染方法是直接接觸傳染物，或性交症狀是白帶大量增加，顏色淡黃，泡末樣，如右拿一滴白帶稀在鹽水中用顯微鏡檢查，立即可看出滴虫，此種白帶對於皮膚非常刺　，使患者感覺奇癢，日夜不安，治療方法（一）用噴粉器將殺滴虫的藥物如銀化物，砒化物或Vioform粉末噴散在陰道黏膜上，同時每天將同類塞藥塞在險道的深部。（二）每天用乳酸灌洗陰道，然後用產酸性塞藥塞在陰道深部，以維持陰道的酸性反應，因為滴虫在酸性中也是不易生長的。治療結果不定，有些病人很容易完全斷根，但有些病人時常會復發的，所以治療不宜間斷。</p>
<p>（四）單純性陰道炎</p>
<p>這種發炎大半因為陰這黏膜受了刺　如常期用子宮托或局部用强性藥物等，一般無知婦女有時受孕後想人工流產，於是用種種藥品或刺　物放入陰道，也有時因灌洗陰道所用的藥水太濃，使黏膜受損症狀是發白帶狀，很多並且有臭味，陰道黏膜甚至腐爛，，因為有腐菌存在的緣故自覺陰部乾燥，發癢等，治療方法最要緊是將病源隊去，然後用輕消毒劑灌洗陰道，結果是良好的。</p>
<p>（五）急性子宮頸炎</p>
<p>子宮頸急性發炎的原因，不外淋菌的侵入及生產或流產時子宮頸扯裂後化膿菌得深入傷口，子宮頸的粘膜就起反應而終於發炎了。</p>
<p>症狀是白帶增多，黃色靭粘，小便刺痛，次數頻繁，子宮頸有流血現象和縻爛，故診斷是很容易的。至於要斷定病源是什麼細菌，祗須把白帶用顯微鏡檢查或細菌培養即可知道。治療方法用化學療法及阻止過度疲乏如跳舞，長距離行走等。早期治潦的結果是滿意的，若忽略不治那末發炎容易蔓延到子宮及輸卵管。</p>
<p>慢性子宮頸炎是一種最普通的婦女病，平時祗要是白帶增加及子宮頸有破裂或糜爛就可診斷為慢性子宮頸炎，但是最近婦科專家　詳加檢查，把白帶加以培養，子宮頸的組織切片，加以顯微鏡檢查後並不能發現有何種細菌存在。所以許多所謂慢性子宮頸炎，並不是正規的發炎。這種現象大半是因為產後子宮頸受傷，那時也許有細菌侵入；但很快的痊癒了。可是子宮頸的分泌腺却因此而過長分泌也就增加了，但性質並非膿狀而是粘液樣的；同時病者有下墮感覺及腰酸等。治療目的並不在除滅細菌而在破壞或减少過長的子宮頸腺。道樣分泌也可因此减少了。治療方法：（一）將子宮頸及子宮頸管用電凝固法使過長腺壞死；（二）用氯化鋅通電起化學作用將子宮頸及子宮頸管燒灼；（三）若子宮頸裂傷非常厲害，那末要將傷口　補或施行子宮頸截斷術。</p>
<p>（七）子宮頸癌</p>
<p>子富頸癌的病源衆說不一，目前還不能斷定它的眞實原因，不過局部的慢性刺戟，一般的認為一個因素。癌的組織是從子宮頸的鱗狀細胞生長出來的，或是從子宮頸管或腺的柱狀細胞長成的。據統計子宮頸痛是最普通的婦女癌病。平常四十歲郵五十歲的婦女最容易生子宮頸癌；但是二十多歲和六十多歲的人也會生的。症狀在初期祗是少量水狀白帶，偶然白帶中有血，丈其在接觸之後。可惜在這時期病者往往忽略不去求醫。到第二第三期白帶大量，黃色腺狀有惡嗅，道是因為癌長大有壞死，腐爛及傳染的緣故。同時有大量出血，到第四期癌的生長蔓延入骨盤結締組織，神經及膀胱或直腸，所以有腹痛，腿痛，腰痛，便秘，小便刺痛有血，體重大减等等之現象。在初期癌的診斷是不容易的，因症狀並不顯著，除非把子宮頸組織切片用顯微鏡檢查才可斷定</p>
<p>治療方法可分二種：（一）施行手術再加照射——先行手術將子宮頸，子宮，輸卵管，卵巢及骨盆結締組織完全出，然後再用鐳錠及深度X光照射，這種方法，祗可應用於第一期病者，所謂第一期是癌的生長僅限於子富頸而己；（二）不行手術而祗是用鐳錠及深度X光照射，近來照射法逐漸改進所以治療的結果很好，因為這種方法不限止於第一期病者，治療的結果據一九三八年十六個照射處的報吿，以五年不復發為標準，平均一百個子宮頸癌病人（第一期到第四期都有）經照射治療後，有二十七個能活五年而不復發的，如果分期而論，那末第一期病人有百分之五十七是五年內不復發的。第四期病人祗有百分之五個半在五年內不復發可見同樣生子宮頸癌，第一期和第四期的預後相差很大，所以早期診斷及早期治療是多麼的重要呀。</p>
<p>其他產生白帶的原因還有很多，例如陰道及外陰生癌，子宮腔症等等，因限於篇幅，這裏祗能從略。總之，白帶的增多，有時祗是輕微的發炎，但有時也許是某種嚴重病症的先兆；因此我們應該糾正過去忽視白帶的錯誤觀念。奉勸人一般女同胞，當發現白帶的時候，最好是馬上請醫生去檢查一下。假如是輕微的發炎，當然立即可以治愈；縱使是最可怕的子宮頸癌，在初期立即治療也有一大半可以得到良好的結果的。但是切不可因懶於檢查而產生了嚴重的後果或是因存繳悻的心理而躭誤了醫治的機會。喬樹民</p>

<h3>性與精神病</h3>
<p>— 朱漢英</p>
<p>無論在中國或歐美，在過去關於「性」的智識，站在宗敎上或道德上觀看，認為是穢褻的思想，為高尙人仕所恥於問聞的，因此數千年來我們是在這種謬談的傳統觀念下，禁止知道「性」的智識，結果造成了許多的性心理變態，最近三十年來歐美各國已豎立開明的新觀念，推行性敎育與性衛生，但是中國仍舊籠罩着濃厚的舊觀念，這是醫學界與敎育界所應加以注意的。</p>
<p>我們知道一切生物，均有「生殖」的本能，在低等的生物，有「生殖」而無「性」；在高等的動物，有「生殖」同時有「性」；但是一般動物性欲僅存在於有生殖能力之年齡內，而人類性欲的存在，並不一定在生殖時期；很多的學者都承認男女孩重均有自發的性慾，例如嬰孩的吸吮母乳，有一種愉快的感覺，因嘴在成年亦是性感部份之一，又如男孩對母親均具好感，若有第三者分割他的母愛時，他會產生妒嫉，同樣女孩對父親亦產生好感，羅此會作一詳細的統計，男孩性感的開始年齡，大概自五歲到十四歲間，女孩性感開始年齡，自八歲到十七歲間。</p>
<p>男女孩童身體發育成熟以後，雙方均須選擇一適當配偶，在熱戀期中的靑年，多少含有一點「瘋狂」，因而產生多多少少的婍妮豔事，英遜皇與辛博生夫人便是一個例十，這種在態在心理學上，不屬於變態的，那末通常所談的「想思病」與「花癡」是指何種精神變態而言呢？簡略分述如下：</p>
<p>「想思病」是發生於向內個性一類病者，他或她素喜以沉思夢想來滿足他或她的慾望，因此縫綣病榻，享受他的幻想與幻覺生活，常見於精神分裂病（Scleizonereuia）患者，「花癡」病者，大多是具向外個性，她或他常把臉部頭髮及衣飾等修飾得使人十分刺目喜與異性親近，並露骨地表示愛慕，有時寫信給素不相識的異性，或信口雌黃地宣揚「定於某日於某處訂婚」等胡語，常見於輕性在燥症（Hypomauia）患者。</p>
<p>一般認為二種病的對症發藥是「結婚」，實際上一個心理健全的人，無論遭受任何重大的刺激，不會產生精神病，除非有先天心理上的不健全，所以結婚祗可治愈極小一部份的輕性「想思病」與「花癡」患者；這一部份的患者，不經結婚的手續，亦會自然而愈。若使採用過去的高度禁慾的辦法，宗敎家把性慾的發洩宣揚為有凟神靈，道德家指斥為下流無恥，但是所得的結果，適得其反；那末我們放棄了禁慾而採取縱慾，可是性慾不是食慾，解決的時候是需要對方，所以在放任之下一定演出了許多的侵犯他人的舉動，以致造成種種違反法律的事件，唯一的方法是在兒童時代起，開始灌施性敎育，盡這份責任的人，最適當的莫過於母親，小孩們最普通的好奇心，是明瞭男女身體構造的異同，須自然的回答，是自小父母與小兒採取共浴的辦法，這樣可免去病態的好奇心，同時注意性衛生，如生活要有規律，食物以素為主，冷水浴，不奢侈，進免一切強烈的身心刺激，愼交朋友，勤於工作，多作運動等，這樣可使有「精神質」的兒童，不致到壯年時演出性精神病。</p>
<h3>醫壇新知</h3>
<p>— 喬樹民</p>
<p>初生兒口服血漿液</p>
<p>打開近代的醫學文獻來看，在許多初生嬰兒的問題之中，尤其是先天不足的平產未熱嬰兒，有一個很重要而不易解决的問題，便是出生後的體重的减輕，甚至過了許多天還不能恢復到出生時的體重。</p>
<p>種種哺喂的新食譜，如高量蛋白質的含量，固亦不無小補，但終未臻圓滿之境。</p>
<p>把母體的胎盤的血，經過臍帶的路子，輸送給嬰兒，確也可以防止生後體重的减輕，可是手續頗為繁難，在一般的情形之下是不容易做到的。</p>
<p>我們知道血漿的性質，與初乳（Colostrum）頗為相近，牠的蛋白質，是可以滲透嬰兒的腸壁而被吸收。用牠來哺喂嬰兒，確能制止出生後體重的减輕。</p>
<p>據羅二醫行（John　F．Loehle）的報吿，他用血漿液，哺喂七個早產未熟的嬰兒，體重都沒有一點减輕，但是一且停服血漿，體重便吿减輕。</p>
<p>他又做了哺噥　生兒的塑　：老大由母親喂奶；老二祗喂糖水，在二十四小時之內，氣喘而發　，用氧氣來治廉，共十六小時，依然無效，於是　他血漿液，在一小時以內，情勢大爲轉好，其後繼搬　血漿液　母乳哺喂，居然後來居上，體重勝過乃兄。羅二醫生　有趣，他又把老二的血漿液停服，轉以喂老大，不數日，老大景居上風。</p>
<p>此外，又試騐兩對　生兒和其他四個平產未熟嬰兒，成效皆卓著·所堪注意者，一般的人工哺喂，當有嘔吐現象，可是服用了血漿液，嘔吐便吿停止。可見血漿液本身。沒有刺激胃粘膜的副作用，也許具有抗　的作用呢，將來的嬰兒哺喂法，行將有所改進，或以含有高量的提自血漿的蛋白質為主。</p>
<p>哺喂血漿液的分劑，應該是多少呢？據羅二醫生的經騐，普通是每公斤體重，服用十西西（c．c．），每二小時口服一次，倘於二十四小時後體重不减，甚至增加，那麼就每二小時半口服一次，連服二日，其後再酌改為每三小時口服一次。</p>
<p>羅二醫生所用的是人的血漿。（原文載J．Pediat　28：145，1948）筆者來看，猪血漿牛血漿：…是否也可採用呢？請國內的兒科醫生試試看，筆者旅中有所不便也。</p>
<h3>花枊病淺說</h3>
<p>— 董寶機</p>
<p>花柳病是人類解決性生活失敗後的副產品，牠有沉着而可畏的傳染性，和緩慢而進行性的破壞力。生要的來源是性交，所以通稱之謂性病，或花柳病，但是從其他方面得到傳染的偶而也有之。</p>
<p>普通分別起來，花柳病包括五種：梅毒，淋病，軟疳，花柳性淋巴腺肉芽腫，和腹股溝肉芽腫。脊的把尖頭濕疣也算在裏面。其中最重要的，要算是梅毒和淋病。梅毒較為嚴重，淋病較為普遍，比梅毒差不多多上五六倍。其他幾種大都是局部性的，對週身的影響較少，腹股溝肉芽腫在熱帶地區較為多些，在中國雖不敢說絕對沒有，但實際的病例很少。</p>
<p>淋病——得病後，最初的時候，生殖器上感覺刺激，排出白色分泌物，俗稱白濁，或白帶，以後病者小便疼痛，次數增加，大約有好幾個星期，病狀漸漸消失。道種現象並不是說疾病已經自己痊愈，實際上，後發的急性病狀隨時可以出現。這樣循環地害病下去，身體的反應，使病着的部份造就不少纖維組織，就是疤痕一類的東西，結果使男的小便不通，以致在他的終身，每年一定需要用器械硬通好幾次，女的輸卵管閉塞，永遠不能生育。有時病菌可能由血液傳播到關節，成了關節炎，到心臟，成了嚴重的心臟病。</p>
<p>淋病的病菌可在病者生殖器的排泄物中找到。牠們的傳播方式，最普通的可分四種，（一）直接由性交而傳染，（二）排泄物由手部混入眼部造成盲目，（三）從不潔的揩布或洗滌器傳到幼孩的生殖器裏，（四）在生產時嬰孩經過帶病的生殖道接觸傳染。通常在厠所，杯筷上傳染的機會較少，因為這種細菌在乾冷的地方，馬上就會死去。</p>
<p>因為身體上組織不同，男的所受痛苦，較女的為現實，以致女的得病以後，不常去注意而醫治，甚至有些女子，明明曉得已經染到淋病，因為暫時不被疾病受累，故意不去理會牠，這種女子是可怕的種子生產所。</p>
<p>梅毒在中國已有四百多年的歷史，最初只限於沿海港口一帶，為數尙少，現在呢，在遙遠的內地，也是很普遍的了。這是危陰的現象，梅毒醫學的進展，還不過四十年（自從發現梅毒螺旋菌以後），六〇六的發明（一九二），和最近化學治療法的進步，足使人們努力實現防治的工作。</p>
<p>梅毒初期，是無痛癢的硬性　痬。通常生在生殖器外部容易受傷的地方，大的在受染後四星期可以發現，這就是俗稱謂下疳，或硬疳，下疳會在五六星期後自已長好，以後的一二年間便是二期梅毒的進展時期。在這期內，梅毒菌由血液帶至各部淋巴腺，，造成淋巴腺腫，梅疹，喉痛，骨痛等等。這種病狀有重有輕，也會自巴消失，不過在五年至二十五年間漸漸進入第三期。梅毒菌由淋巴腺而達到了內臟，大動脈，心臟，肝臟，骨部，神經，腦子，產生的病狀，隨着病菌集中損傷地方而不同，心痛，心臟衰弱，瞎眼，癲狂，神經病，等等。</p>
<p>梅毒通常由性交直接傳染。但醫師或護士不愼由於接觸病人而染到的亦偶然有的。有病的母親，除非經過適當的治療，很容易傳染給胎兒，道種嬰兒倘不醫治，偶然仍能生存至一二十年，他們的智力不敏，或常成殘廢。</p>
<p>六〇六能治愈梅毒，這是只對初期二期而言的。而且只由合理的醫法方可得到。醫治愈早，成效愈好，初期患者未受痛苦，一般尤以女子為甚，常不介意，而失去良好根治的機會。再有一部病人一知半解，自己服藥，或聽從庸醫欺騙，治了一半，暫時滿苦雖息，日後重病復發，為害不淺。醫者常有騐血方法，檢定潛伏性梅毒，這並不是說騐血一定可以確斷牠的存在，因為這種試騐的靈敏性，不過百分之八十五左右。換句話說，一百個眞正梅毒病人，只有八十五人可從騐血證明，凡最早期的（得病六星期前），或最晚期的（三期一部份），或經過一半治療者，血淸梅毒反應（瓦氏或康氏）常呈陰性。</p>
<p>從以上各點，我們可知道，花柳病實是一種可怖的悲劇。對於牠唯一確切的預防，要避免與患者性交，尤其是非法的性交，當然非法性交，與花柳病傳染，不一定是定理相關。但娼妓們因為接客衆多、得病的機會遠較普通人為多。私娼差不多要較公娼更多，這都是事實。</p>
<p>用橡皮陰莖套，或外用消素藥，（普通用肥皂熱水已够使外部的細菌消滅）或內服或注射預防殺菌藥後，和一位有花柳病的女子性交，其得病的機會，可减少大部，但決不是絕對沒有。梅毒性的潰瘍，照樣可在橡皮套以外的地方出現。甚至每當酒醉的時候，男人們用之不當，也是很多。淸毒藥雖能暫時抑制初期病狀，但常使病菌沉着進攻，後患殊深。軍隊裹用這種方法，是適應非常環境，情由可愿，但決非普通民衆所可適宜而安全的。</p>
<p>其他要注意的，是早期和完整合理的治療。倘患者能在后期內使之消失其傳染性，那末傳染他人的機會，就可减少很多。這種問題包括，如何使病人去看醫師，醫師如何完整地醫治疾病，和如何使病人繼續地完成合理的根治。一切與心理，技術，和敎育有關係。</p>
<p>現在讓我們來檢討怎樣對付花柳病？淫蕩和酒醉是主要致病的因素，敎育與幸福事業比任何預防方法好得多。世界各國公娼制時常失敗，因娼妓管理愈緊，她們會害怕因病而失業，不如流為私娼，並且醫生撿騐娼妓，每月三次，化的時間很少，檢騐無病的證明，決不能完全保證沒有花柳病的存在。這是學術上的問題。除非對於人民戶口有良好的管制，對違反治療的病人有法律的規定，以補充敎育的不足，有適當的醫事從業員，完整治療，她們每天消毒預防，方可减少傳染的機會。對於平民間的病人，也是一樣。</p>
<p>總之，花柳病是公認為危驗的，需要每個人能認識花柳病傳染的嚴重性，自己管制自己的理智，認淸目標，不要尋花問柳而得到疾病。倘使這一步不能辦到，他也要選擇一下他的對象，用他的智　去預防牠。最後，倘使他已經發覺得了花柳病需要完善地根治牠，決不可再害他人或延誤自己。這樣纔可以從治病而達到防病，最後進入理想的社會衛生。</p>

<h3>趕三關</h3>
<p>— 若斯</p>
<p>過了陽曆年關，又過陰曆年關，關關難過，弄得性命交關。</p>
<p>中國人過雙重生活巳有若十年，過了「外國冬至」（聖誕節），再過中國冬至；陽曆新年放假，險曆新年也要休息，都有了個雙料。這倒不打緊；而年關一有雙料，呌人兩渡過關，金融商界被頭寸軋扁，却有些吃不消。</p>
<p>前兩天中國戲院唱全本紅鬃烈馬，薛平貴赶過了兩關之後，還未脫險地，等到跑到三關，才敢回轉身來，和「頂急黃包車」的代戰公主對唱一番。</p>
<p>上海灘上，也無非如此，所謂「軋」過年關，過而稱「軋」，其怱忙，其急迫，其窮兇極惡也可知。</p>
<p>希望大家軋穩，最低限度不要軋翻；如果在第一關第二關一軋翻，就跑不上三關，那裏還有同代戰公主對唱的身份？更不用說大登殿大團圓了。</p>
<h3>智識之源</h3>
<p>— 成琛</p>
<p>談「世界年鑑」的編撰</p>
<p>世界年鑑，每年銷行六十萬册。一九四七年版已於一月份的第一星期出版。編者是伊斯門歐文，一個身材高大，白髪綠眼的新聞記者。他担任這美國最煩重的工作，一些也不容疏忽。在每年搜集在年鑑　的數千條資料裹，只要有極微細的錯誤，就會惱怒各地學者，引起許多責問和議諷。</p>
<p>在世界各大城市的圖書館裏，這年鑑由於應用頻繁，弄得書角捲摺，汚損破裂，每年要換上二三本，有時被人撕掉二一頁，去證明某一件事實，以致殘缺不全。</p>
<p>不但圖書館需要購備一份世界年鑑，就是商人敎師學生作家律師和公務人員都要人手一册。編輯先生的書桌上沒有這本年鑑，總覺得設備不全。</p>
<p>世界年鑑銷行全世界。如中國的北京大學，也備有戰前歷年的年鑑，自從一八八五年起，陳舊的年鑑，也往往被法院裏參考，解決某種問題。譬如某年某月裏那一天潮水最高，那天的月亮最圓。</p>
<p>除掉關於人口選舉，運動，商業，等正常統計之外，這年鑑還搜羅世界珍聞異事。要知道人身那一個內臟最重，肝呢？還是腦子？只要查看世界年鑑。肝的重量是一六〇〇公分，腦子重一四〇〇公分，美國馬和驢子有多少？在一九四五年，共有一二·三〇五·〇〇〇頭，在十年內减少了四百萬頭。一，個女人每天需要多少熱力？二五〇〇卡路里。一只蒼蠅身上有多少細菌？六百萬個。美國最亮的燈塔在紐澤稷州的納維新克，光度是九百萬支燭光。</p>
<p>編入這年鑑的還有各類的記錄，如一九〇〇年以前的火腿價格，主要出產磨刀石，油石的是那一州，辨識偽幣的方法，美國大街小路的總長度，紐約市死胎的總數，一七七六年七月四日是星期幾，祝賀結婚二年紀念的適當禮物是什麽。</p>
<p>你要想從皇家大樓上跳下來試騐達到地面要經過多少時間嗎？只要查一下物體下墜的速度好了，大的是九秒鐘。</p>
<p>常常有人要歐文在無綫電裏答覆奇怪的問題。一個答案纔發出，一個問題又來。詢問的電話忙得他發狂，有個主婦問他，人身血管有多少長，他狂呌着說，「太太，共有十萬英哩長」。</p>
<p>戰時世界年鑑寄到世界第一角落去慰寂寞的美兵。他們常常和歐文通訊，提出問題，有一次南太平洋二個美兵爭論紐約和芝加哥的市內交通綫那個最長。後來歐文證明，把電車公共汽車和升降機全計算在內，是紐約佔第一位。</p>
<p>世界年鑑由世界電訊社發行，已是第六十一年了。起初二十年內，漸漸發展到年銷三十萬份。一九三七年歐文担任編輯，大加改良，注重趣味和時代性，刪除不必要的文字，加人關於食品營養，和科學的資料。</p>
<p>每年五月六月世界年鑑編輯室發信給全世界各方面的權威和專家，徵求材料，收信人有市長政府官吏，校長商會和其他可以搜集資料的機關。聯邦檢查局商務部和海陸軍都給他帮助。</p>
<p>歐文選擇資料並沒有一定標準，全憑他的經騐來決定。經他努力的結果，銷數已是加倍了。</p>
<h3>一位剌嘛敎徒談西藏</h3>
<p>— 潘承烈</p>
<p>淸華大學在一月十日下午請到一位十年前畢業於該校，現在做了喇嘛的校友來演講，因為他和藏民在一起生活有八年之久，所以他所看到的西藏，比我們一般人知道的要比較多些而且準確些。</p>
<p>這位喇嘛名呌瑣南嘉措，他也有漢名，最引人注目的就是他奇特的服裝：全身披着暗紅色的呢質儈服，腰間束着一幅長得拖到脚的紅呢，土服的前面都是織錦的，可是袖子短得幾乎滑　。這樣冷的天，手臂還是完全露出，外面披上一幅一丈二尺長的暗紅色呢，把身體裹起來，但右手總是常常袒露在外。這些衣料都是西藏的土製。</p>
<p>雖然服裝這樣怪異，他卻說得一口很純粹的北平話。</p>
<p>手中仍舊拿着一串黑白相間的唸珠，他開始了「西藏現况」的介紹。</p>
<p>藏人信仰的喇嘛敎的活佛，並不完全和佛敎中的「佛」相同，道德和學問高深的喇嘛就可成活佛，因此活佛很多，有時一個小寺院中就有一個，大寺院常多至幾十個，相信三世因果的敎徒，對於活佛轉世，是絕對深信的；當一個活佛死時，他的許多弟子便哀求他來世仍舊到這裏來指導他們並繼續他今生未完的事業，活佛答應了，有時還吿訴他的弟子們來世投生到那一家或那一地方，於是弟子便去尋找在他死後四十九天內出生的嬰孩，認為這必是活佛轉世；但有時這樣的嬰孩下只一個，他們便用種種方法來試騐那一個是眞的活佛：如呌小孩去辨認活佛前生的用器，或觀察小孩的貌相·聰明等，常他到了能够脫離家庭的年齡，便把他接回廟去，做他前生未完的工作，在這種情形下，活佛永遠不會因死去而减少，却只有增加出來，所以那裏的活佛是愈來愈多了。</p>
<p>藏人的生活很簡樸，一年四季只有一件羊皮衣服，五張羊皮可以合一襲；但因為太長，他們在腰間用根帶子一束把拖下的提上來，腰帶以上寬得成了一個包，他們便把常用的東西如飯碗之類塞在裏面，熱天手臂露出，冷了用衣服裹起，晚上睡覺把衣服脫下舖在地上，人睡在上面，就這樣一半當褥子一半當被。</p>
<p>吃時用手，沒有筷子，碗是木製的。吃起來先盛了茶，上面澆一層黃油，把油先吹在一旁喝去下面的茶，再把磨成粉的裸麥倒下，和餘下的油混在一起，用水調和，搓成小　子吃，</p>
<p>他們常把數十年積蓄所得，去獻給奉若神明的活佛，而活佛不過摸一摸他腦袋就完了。每人財產很少，部分得極淸，如道只碗是丈夫的，那隻壺是妻子的，一人　　把他全部財產收集起來，送給私人或大家，或獻給活佛。</p>
<p>婚姻制度以一夫一妻居多，但也有一夫多妻及一妻多夫的。一夫多妻大槪是有錢人，把幾個太太分開住，一妻多夫是幾個兄弟合娶一妻，以免分家時的許多不便，孩子生了出來人們並不重視這孩子的爸爸是誰，所以到底是大哥生的還是二哥生的，他們之間倒也沒有爭執。</p>
<p>在政治上，西藏很少受中央的管轄，英國想伸張勢力範圍到這裏來，藏人就常藉了中央的保護來拒絕英國的要求，又有時作相反的運用。據說，以藏人眼光看來，他們也有着逼不得已的苦衷呢！</p>
<p>怎樣使西藏和中央有更深切的迎繫呢？單靠交通·政治·或軍事力量是不够的，除了同時從這些入手外，最重要的還在於溝通他們的文化，現在靑海邊界上已有了一所喇嘛學校，經費是國家撥給的，這可謂溝通文化的工作之一。</p>

<p>送年禮</p>
<p>本帮乞丐在除夕間有送禮的豪舉，手提被黃籃一隻，內盛紅紙封的空包一個，和鷄毛一撮，居然冒充送年禮物。好在人家誰也不會收他們的「厚禮」的，然而「脚錢」却不得不打發。丐流在歌詞裹也老實不客氣地聲明出來。眞是幽默之至了。詞日；</p>

<h3>受情儲蓄箱</h3>
<p>— 建華譯自紐約日報</p>
<p>紐約費斯博士，對於性學上的貢獻，得有學術界的好評。他的著作很多，如「性的研究」，「新婚期的性生活」，和「接吻的起源與趨勢」等書，都傳誦一時，為各界士女們所歡迎。上月（十二月）廿四日博士和他的夫人，舉行銀婚紀念，到賓客二百餘人，在這盛大宴會中，博士與其夫人，公開兩件秘密事情，一是「愛情儲蓄箱」，一是「情會展覽」。</p>
<p>當衆開彩</p>
<p>博士自結婚的那天起，特製木箱兩隻，名呌愛情儲蓄箱。假使博士想和他的夫人同夢時，須把美金五元，投入甲箱；假使博士夫人亦忽感需要時，也須將美金五元，投入乙箱；萬一雙方同時同感，那麼各納五金，表示公允。四十餘年中間，從未間斷過一次。銀婚這天，博士當衆開箱，共得儲金二萬四千六百元，足見夫婦愛情的濃厚。不過甲箱儲金，多過乙箱六分之一。</p>
<p>情書展覽</p>
<p>博士夫人名麥米倫，在她四十年前，交際塲中，很負盛譽，拜倒石榴裙下的，達二十餘少年，求婚的情書，不絕地送來，當時夫人的能度，不即不離，一寸芳心，不知她傾注在誰的身上，等到她和博士結婚的時候，大家才明白了中選的是博士。夫人自結婚的那天止，共計接到情書五百多封。銀婚之日，闢了一間精舍，把道五百餘封情書，一一陳列起來，公開展覽。昔年致書夫人的翩翩少年，現在大半變成霜鬢皓苜的老賓客了，他們看到自己的情書，有的啞然失笑，有的忸怩慚愧，但是博士夫人，仍舊天眞坦白，殷勤招待，似乎中心像沒有關係的一樣</p>

<h3>阿根遷總統夫人（下）</h3>
<p>— 佐溪</p>
<p>一位迷樣少婦</p>
<p>阿根廷的納粹份子雖然仍進行着「地下」的政治活動，但是他們已經能用好聽的慈善事業的名義向復到半官性質的活動了。譬如有人問及貝隆夫人的最大的興趣是什麽時，她的回答是：「我正在組織婦女救濟會，育兒所，福兒院，和施衣給藥救濟貧病的工作。」</p>
<p>她領導的團體</p>
<p>貝隆夫人所領導的組織最好的社會服務機構，都是德人主辦的團體，像德國慈善會，德國婦女慈善會，德國福音會，德國濟貧會，德國務院協會等。這些團體在理論上雖受政府的控制，但實際上有納粹黨最高指揮部所任命的職員，由納粹黨員領導，和以前的阿根廷納粹黨員保持着接觸。</p>
<p>貝隆獲得阿根廷勞動階級的擁護是毫無疑義的。但是這些工人並不是北美洲受過敎育的獨立的工人。據貝期反對派在競選運動時所散發的報告稱：「這些工人是從阿根廷京城郊外工業軍裏收買來的暗殺團員，大多數佩帶貝期所供給的武器，他們每八支領十到五十比索的津貼。吃喝全由公費報銷，並且得暗示可以任所欲為，決不致受到任何處分。</p>
<p>羅特在「聖路易斯快郵報」中把貝隆和希特勒所採用的方法作一對比。他說貝隆的「班底」都很年輕又很貧苦，正是希特勒用用以組織恐怖團的同樣貨色，但是具隆「最初的思想工具」是歷年以來拉丁美洲人對於美國人的恐懼和不信任。貝隆夫婦首先認定這種反美情緒可能利用作為一種政治武器。</p>
<p>最關重要的一點是貝隆的勞工關係幾乎完全由的他夫人親自處理，會經謠傳貝隆夫人不久或將正式成為拉丁美洲的第一位女勞工部長。</p>
<p>貝產夫人的社交活動頗受到反對派的指摘，可是她毫不介意，或者故意裝做那樣。她談到她的社會生活時說：「我很少時間參加社交活動，甚至很少時間觀劇，看電影或到音樂會去。週末的時間大都和我丈夫消磨在我們的農塲上，在那裹我量位和頃的主婦，給我丈夫烹製他心愛的菜肴，並料理一切家務。」</p>
<p>活躍外交圈中</p>
<p>貝隆夫人在外交界方面也頗露頭角。最近她會出席美國大使館的宴會，自從美阿關係發生裂痕以來，阿根廷總統夫人的出席大使館宴會，還是第一次哩。</p>
<p>伊娃貝隆大胆鑽營權勢的動機是什麽？她的雄心何在？也許可從她的談話裏面得到一些暗示。她在回想她遇到貝期以前的歌劇生涯時稱：「我生平最大的激動，是在扮演歷史上的偉大女性伊薩伯拉女王，大卡德隣，伊麗莎伯等角色的時候。」（節譯自「雜誌文摘」一月號）</p>

<h3>賭徒</h3>
<p>— 令云</p>
<p>快夜晚了，太陽已把最後一點微弱的枯黃的陽光也收回了；本来已很灰暗的天空，愈增加了暗的程度；朔风也凑趣地益發峭勁了，打前面山谷裏溜下來，發出淒厲的顫聲，大地在哆索。</p>
<p>一隻寒鴉在空際兜了幾個圈子，茫然地棲息在韓阿炳家對面一株大樟樹上，撲撲翅膀，惡，惡地呌了幾聲。</p>
<p>「呸！」阿炳下意識地吐了口唾沫，一轉身便拐進灶屋裏來。</p>
<p>「媽，幹媽！庵堂廟宇似的！」阿炳一跨進門，就給烟迷住了眼，蹂着脚就發恨。</p>
<p>「噯！大年三十的，還這么大的氣！」他老婆給烟嗆着淌着眼淚，正躦在灶門口，在拔鷄毛。</p>
<p>阿炳不看倒也罷，一看又鬧蹩扭！「有你這種女人，連養鷄也不會，養成這個模樣！」</p>
<p>他老婆倐的立起身來，把手裏一只僅有一把骨頭的鷄往灶桌上一撩！啐道：</p>
<p>「才有你這種人家呢？人家米呀麥的，你家連糠屑都找不到，還想吃肥鷄，有你福氣！倒不如整天窩在黃老七的家……」</p>
<p>阿炳把眉毛一挺，要想發作，可又沒什麽說的；聳了聳肩胛，管自跨進隔壁草堂裏去了。</p>
<p>寒颯的隙風，像蛇舌子般的從瓦縫裏滑進來，括在阿炳那毛茸茸的面頰上，怪冷森森地，不禁使阿炳打了個寒噤，頭腦子頓時清醒了不少！「媽的，今年不知那個煞神跟定了我，明明算定了跳青龍，徧徧會來三連的白虎；莊家翻出人丁一，自已徧扳別十；這倒不必說起了，徧徧又輸在黃老七的手裏，他是不好惹的；可不是早上已說過了，今天準不放我過門，那真該死……」</p>
<p>想到這裏，阿炳立覺煩躁起來了！「真該死！」他把壓在眉毛上的那頂油　帽往後腦杓子一掀，連連在屋子裏打圈子。</p>
<p>果然，在吃晚飯的時候，黃老七差林根來呌阿炳去，背後還跟着在鄉公所當差的祥福。阿炳老婆看出三個人有些鬼祟祟，正待趕去問個明白，可是三個人早一溜烟跑了。</p>
<p>夜裏，阿炳打黃老七的家裏出來，已有三更光景，背後也跟着祥福；幾條野狗子，緊跟在後面狺狺的吠着；祥福不住地罵狗，還不住罵阿炳走路沒得勁！</p>
<p>一路上間有幾家在門縫裏透出輝煌的燭光來；有時在暗地裏激起一陣子爆竹聲，火花四處射竄着；可是這些在阿炳眼裏，只是一片糢糊。</p>
<p>到家了，阿炳就請祥福在屋簷下等一會，自己跨進門就往裏房躦，他老婆隨脚也跟了進來。</p>
<p>「幹什麽？」</p>
<p>「沒有什麽！」阿炳嘴裏回答着，蹺起屁股僅往床裏爬。</p>
<p>他老婆心裏明白，忙把懷裏的孩子就床上一拋，騰出兩手，一把把阿炳的手臂抱住了。那孩子原含着奶頭，眼花瞇瞇的快要入睡了，經此一嚇，不由大聲的哭起來。</p>
<p>「放手，不干你事。」</p>
<p>「天殺的！你倒不如把我們娘兒倆殺了也干凈。你把這命根子又押給了誰……」</p>
<p>阿炳把手裏的田喫，胡亂地往懷裏一揣。</p>
<p>女的慌忙來搶，阿炳顺勢狠命的一推，女的就撲倒在地上，嘴裏殺豬也似的呌喊起來；可是仍給她抓住了衣角。</p>
<p>「還不放手！」這可使阿炳軟不下了—「拍，拍！」阿炳的手勁是挺硬的，女的臉上早就清脆地着了幾下子。</p>
<p>女的總沒多大力氣，這么一掙，阿炳就脫身往外跑。</p>
<p>「阿炳！你死了嗎？還不快些出來！」</p>
<p>祥福正直着嗓子在外面喊。</p>
<p>作家軼事</p>
<h3>馬克吐溫</h3>
<p>— 泊符</p>
<p>美國有一個歷史學會，收藏着不少關於作家的紀念品。在許多文件中，有一個信封最有趣，收信人明明是寫着馬克吐溫夫人的，但旁邊却加上了一行字：「因欲知內容而誤拆——克理文士」。（馬克吐溫原名Samuel　L.　Clemens）</p>
<h3>夜獵</h3>
<p>— 張白懷</p>
<p>老人是禁不住太息了。記憶雖然像詩人的童話一樣，把他又一次引回到青年時代的力的花園，然而，在最美麗的盡頭，他終於看見自己在狂暴的風雨中披起了白髮的簑衣；像有無限的感慨似的，他於是點燃了長長的竹烟桿。</p>
<p>「呵，現在，現在沒有好獵狗，也沒有好銃手了。」他說。</p>
<p>老人的心，此刻正在怎麼的爲自己昔日的光榮悼惜與悲傷？星光的夏夜變成了一片沉默的沃土，在那上面，誰知道躭於幻想的少年們有過怎樣的收獲？</p>
<p>那些無疑的是一串勇敢的狩獵的故事。人們會完全相信這個忠實的老人，可是也會帶着驚奇，問他數十年前的往事說來爲什麽還這樣的新鮮和親切？</p>
<p>我們却全然沒有經騐過。生長在海邊的人記憶裏祇有貝殼的彩色；而生長在山谷裏的人，他們慣於擁抱神秘的森林與川澤。</p>
<p>那老人所以驕傲他唱過一支年青的歌曲，因爲這在他的生命裏是有着非凡的意義的。他有興趣嚕嚕叨叨的叙述，說自己怎樣打死一匹肥大的野豬，並且十分正確地說出那獵物的重量和揹回家裏時的英勇的姿態，他說一匹兇猛的老虎怎樣挖了一個獵者的眼睛和抓斷了一個力量最大的鄉人的臂膀；又說自己怎樣的在銀色的月夜，伏在高粱地裏，連呼吸都緊緊地摒息着，靜候獵物的到來……。</p>
<p>「年青的時候，那力氣真大！……啊，真有趣呵！」</p>
<p>我們是可以想像老人的心境了。那一切離然已經永遠不能回來，他一定也異常的快樂，不過悵惘的是會還有別一種殘暮的感觸，藏在那逝去的快樂後邊。</p>
<p>在他補綴着他那故事的殘片的時候，我就想起一個冬天的深夜來。那時我是初到這荒凉的山谷，還沒有看清這裏的白天和夜晚；某一次，望着黑色的窗外，作舒展一天裏的疲勞的深呼吸，突然就聽到山上傳來一個悲號似的尖銳的呌聲，在屋主人的答話裏，我知道這是獵物墜入他們裝置的陷阱裏了。</p>
<p>他們却已經舉着火把提了繩索向山上去。一匹黃狗一樣大小的獵物就被拖着回來。在火把的光裏，尖利的刺刀戳進咽喉，還有一個人拿着碗盛那　熱的鮮血，而且就這么毫不遲疑的像喝茶般地灌進了肚子。</p>
<p>「這可以醫什麽病的嗎？」</p>
<p>「黃麂血，胃病最好的呵！」</p>
<p>我們却是不勝驚奇了。</p>
<p>夏夜的星定閃着銀白的小花朶，像天使的指縫漏下來似的。臨溪的土塲上，人們的趣味在走向叧一種新鮮約有事，老人說某處的山裏有吃人的猩猩，猩猩捉住了人，會笑到昏了過去，從這裏開始，他們的談鋒便轉到玄虛鬼和的飄渺的神靈上去……。</p>

<h3>關於李秀成</h3>
<p>— 鮑雨</p>
<p>忠王李秀成，是太平天國有力的支柱。因其謀勇兼備，曾屢建奇功。但後來太平天國因種種的關係，基礎已動搖，雖有他的努力，無奈不能挽回頽運。結果南京陷落後，忠王即被擒殺，後人多惋惜之。</p>
<p>但當我們二十八年的冬天，隨王乙凡先生在蘇北沭陽打遊擊的時候，我們因訪問居民又無意間在鄉間（楊口附近）遇見了一位「李秀成的孫子」。他是一個七十來歲的莊稼人，耳朶有一點聾。所報的姓氏，是趙姓，名字我現在已記不起了。我們交談之下，他對我們露出自己的平時不願意露的身份—他是李秀成的孫子。並說忠王在被捕以後，曾國藩極力勸他在湘軍工作。忠王絕沒有答應，國藩因爲愛惜他的才幹，不忍加以殺戮，就秘密把他遣送到沭陽鄉間，隱姓埋名，從事農作，以終天年云云。</p>
<p>我們聽了這一番話，覺得非常驚詫。乙凡先生還詢問到其他有關情形，他說因　時年幼，不大清楚。可是最後他用肯定的口吻，重複地說：忠王並沒有被殺。</p>
<p>後來我們回到興化，乙凡先生特地寫了一篇文字，在該地某雜誌發表，曾引起游擊區內一般人士的注意。</p>
<p>今天，見到報紙上載着沭陽有戰事，因此聯想到幾年以前的這回事。</p>
<p>關於忠王的死，大家一定都願意知道他的究竟，但他究竟有沒有被殺呢？我現在姑且作一個粗淺的分析：</p>
<p>在曾國藩奏皇上書中，曾叙述李秀成被擒以後，緊於囚籠中，押赴南京，沿途仍受人膜拜。國藩恐中途爲「匪徒」所刦，故未解京城，即於南京「正法」云。（憑記憶僅錄大意）</p>
<p>像李秀成這樣一個大的「要犯」，當然需要押解京城，經過仔細審問後，纔能處決，而國藩竟以「恐爲匪徒所刦」之理由，即將其「就近正法」，其中似有使人可疑之處；但曾國藩對清廷這樣盡忠，做事又這樣「小心翼翼」，他縱然愛李之才，而我們也決不會相信他能有這樣大的魅力，敢把這個「危險人物」，秘密地釋放。</p>
<p>同時李秀成是太平天國最英勇的領袖，南京陷後，同着福塡逃出，預備抗爭到底。他的精神，值得我們佩服。假如他被捕釋放，他能在窮僻的鄉村裏，隱姓埋名，安靜地過一輩子嗎？這是無論如何不可能的。</p>
<p>我們那時也曾懷疑到這位「李秀成的孫子」恐怕不真實，他是故意借了李秀成之名而想抬高自己的身份的。可是這樣的懷疑或許是多餘的，因爲他是一個粗鹵的莊稼人啊，他又何必這樣做呢？</p>
<p>這一位老者是李秀成的後輩，可以無疑。但他對秀成的「未遭殺死」的說法，或許是一種精神安慰作用吧。</p>
<p>現在這位老者不知道還在否？我　念着他。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血153</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>果然立刻就像雷轟似的，竟有十多個人，同聲呼應「恐急糾擊」。鶴見就着朦朧的月光，早見這片小小廣場上，有的在屋影下，有的在樹脚邊，大大小小，竟有十來堆人，在那裏拼死厮鬥；一幫人都是各色急裝雜服，一幫却是一律玄色短服，連頭臉都有黑中罩着；這是黑龍會會員正式激鬥的制服。略一瞬眼，鶴見看出了黑龍會員比對方要多出幾人。</p>
<p>「大家住手」！鶴見跑到廣場當中一站，高聲喝着。他心下這時實在糊塗得很。黑龍會會員，當然是別府中的武士，用不着猶疑。那么，這些來人究竟是誰呢？「綠野社」的話，是完全無中生有的烟幕彈，自己方面的同志，按計劃所定，沒有這樣大舉厮鬥的這一條，僅僅是四面八方，幾個暗刀暗箭的埋伏，準備援救幾個下地下室搜索七封秘緘的人的。那么，這一羣殺手，究竟是從那裏跳出來的呢？所以鶴見打算先把對象的來踪去跡弄個明白，然後再設法解決問題。</p>
<p>可是儘管鶴見這般大聲呌喝，兩方對陣的人，誰也沒有理會。這未免呌鶴見有些生氣了；情形相當的窘。他看見連喝了幾聲，仍舊無人瞅睬便挑戰式的發話了，「鶴見玉在這裏，請對手方賜教」！</p>
<p>「哈，恐急糾舉啊」！這是一個半空落下來的聲音—一個很熟的聲音。鶴見順着這個聲音的方向，回頭略一霎眼，僅僅一霎眼之間，先從地面上，看見那所大建築，月下投影的邊緣上，有兩三個人影，知道屋頂上有人在觀戰，聽那聲音，好像正是那位雙料啞吧所發。順眼向屋頂一瞧，看見屋頂平台上，果然有人憑欄站着。</p>
<p>就在鶴見回頭的這一剎那，驀然聽得腦後有人高聲唱着，「哈伊！」這聲音寬裏帶沙，又夾着些童音：喊出的這兩個字音，也是武士道常用的口語，表示接受挑戰。接着又聽得那聲音說，「呌你嘗嘗「平野宗」的手段！」聲音已經臨到鶴見身邊了。</p>
<p>鶴見知道對物方已經有人出來，並見來勢甚疾，照理應當回轉頭來，揮刀應敵；他却不慌不忙，反把身子轉了過去，對準屋頂的人影，雙手一捧寳刀，彎下身去，來了一個九十度的鞠躬；一方面表示從容不迫，對那人影致敬；因爲知道這三個人影，其中必有一個近衛；一方面，因爲自己劍道有功夫，也要故意在這些人面前賣弄一下。剛在他這一鞠躬未了的當口，身後步聲已經臨近，同時聽得來人，一聲吆喝「哈！」就在這一聲吆喝裏，鶴見早已閃電般，一上步，一個翻身，刀光映着月亮，一個小要花，同來人的兵器，對了一個正着。</p>

<h3>Government Prepares New Peace Proposal, Decides to Send Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an, Already Informed to the Communist Side by Ambassador Stuart</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] Minister Peng announced at a press conference at 4:30 PM on the 16th that the government intends to send Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an. This matter may be communicated to the Communist Party by Ambassador Stuart today. As for the basis for negotiation, it will be discussed between Zhang and the Communist Party. Peng refused to announce some key points that the government would consider regarding the negotiations, believing that once announced, there would be little room for maneuver, and it would lead to public debate, hindering the progress of negotiations. When reporters inquired about the stage of government reorganization, whether to negotiate first or reorganize the government first, Peng replied that the government is currently planning to negotiate with the Communist Party, and in terms of steps, negotiation should come first, followed by reorganization. Reporters asked whether the Democratic League and other parties would participate in drafting new negotiation proposals. Peng replied that all parties can participate, and they will come to Nanjing one after another. Whether to hold a round table conference or a square table conference is not important; the important thing is the content. Reporters asked: Will a direct approach be taken in the future, or will party meetings be held? Peng replied that on one hand, Zhang Zhizhong will go to Yan'an to inquire the Communist Party, and on the other hand, various parties will discuss in Nanjing. Asked whether the government will grant full freedom of publication in light of the recent declaration on civil rights by the Democratic Socialist Party, Peng replied that publication is already completely free, but before a complete peaceful resolution with the Communist Party, publication that encourages the overthrow of the government and attacks on the national army by force will not be allowed.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The peace talks are gradually being finalized today. After the government formulated a new plan, it announced that it would send personnel to Yan'an and informed the ambassador late at night on the 15th, asking him to convey it to the Chinese Communist Party. How the situation will develop in the future depends on the response of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] Ambassador Stuart invited Wang Bingnan of the Communist Party for an hour-long meeting at 10:30 AM on the 16th. According to Conner, the spokesperson for the American ambassador, the ambassador conveyed to the Chinese Communist Party the new peace plan that the government had prepared and the government's decision to send Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an, and hoped that Wang would consult with Yan'an immediately. It is said that the ambassador did not express any opinions on this matter, but purely conveyed the government's views. Some people believe that the content of the new plan must not be announced at present, so as to avoid failures like the past few times. As for Zhang Zhizhong's trip to Yan'an, it depends entirely on the Communist Party's expression. If they express their consent, he can set off immediately.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] A spokesman for the American Embassy said that Ambassador Stuart has no intention of flying to Yan'an with General Zhang Zhizhong.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] Zhang Zhizhong held a grand banquet at the International Friendship Association on the evening of the 16th, inviting Soviet Ambassador Petrov, Sun Ke, Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, Maxwell Wood, and dozens of other Chinese and foreign celebrities. After the banquet, a dance party was held, and it ended late at night with light clouds and graceful dances.</p>
<h3>Lei Zhen Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday, Invited Representatives of the Youth Party and Democratic Socialist Party to Discuss New Proposals and the Peace Talk Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] Lei Zhen took the night train to Shanghai on the 15th to discuss the new peace plan formulated by the government with people from various parties in Shanghai, so that this plan can be more sound and suitable for the opinions of all parties.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Sources informed reporters that Lei Zhen arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 16th and did not bring a new peace plan. His main task is to invite representatives from the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party to Nanjing to study the peace plan and the situation of the peace talks. Mr. Zhang Junmai has not fully recovered his health and it is not yet determined whether he will go to Nanjing, but the Democratic Socialist Party may send one or two other representatives to go. In addition to Zuo Shunsheng of the Youth Party, who has already gone to Nanjing last night for other matters, more representatives may be sent when needed. In addition, Lei Zhen's stay in Shanghai is scheduled to be very short, and if there are no other reasons, he plans to return to Nanjing tonight.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Zeng Qi, Zuo Shunsheng, and others took the night train to Nanjing yesterday. Before his departure, Zuo told reporters that this trip to Nanjing was for the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Participation Council, so as to hear the government's economic and financial reports, and it was not related to the reopening of peace talks. The number of days of stay in Nanjing is uncertain, and if there are no other matters, he will return to Shanghai after the Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] Zhang Shenfu of the Democratic League met with Wang Bingnan of the Communist Party on the 16th and had some discussions. He then visited Shao Lizi for a long talk.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] A spokesman for the Chinese Communist Party said that if the government could lift restrictions on the magazines and newspapers of the Chinese Communist Party at this time, and if it could release all political prisoners in the amnesty, it would definitely improve the Chinese Communist Party's mood for resuming peace talks. Speaking of reopening peace talks, he said that two prerequisites must be implemented, and the military part "cannot retreat even by a single county." "This matter is like doing business. Last year, empty checks were issued. This year, cash must be traded in order to be guaranteed."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] Mei Yi, a spokesman for the Communist Party, took the night train to Shanghai on the 16th.</p>
<h3>Whether Peace Talks Can Succeed Depends on the Attitude of the Chinese Communist Party</h3>
<p>Talk by Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party [Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Yesterday was the 61st birthday of Zhang Junmai, the leader of the Democratic Socialist Party. His colleagues and friends specially set up a birthday celebration at noon in Fanwei. More than 60 people participated, and the situation was very warm. Jiang Zengyu, a member of the Democratic Socialist Party stationed in Nanjing, also rushed from Nanjing yesterday morning to celebrate his birthday and told reporters: The content of the peace plan is nothing more than a few items such as ceasefire, stationing locations, local government, and restoration of transportation. The key to the endless disputes between the KMT and the CCP is obviously that the two items of stationing locations and local government have not been resolved. In the former case, the two sides are vying for strategic strongholds, with gains and losses on both sides, and neither side can be solely responsible. There is still room for discussion as to what month and date the military status should be restored. As for local government, when the constitution is implemented in the future, governments at all levels in all regions must go through elections, and it seems unnecessary to haggle over this now. In short, all the current problems seem unsolvable when viewed up close, but there is nothing that cannot be solved when viewed from afar. He said: Chairman Chiang has the determination to solve all current problems, but whether he can get his wish depends entirely on the attitude of the Chinese Communist Party. Jiang continued, saying that he would take the train to Nanjing tonight, and Mr. Junmai would also go if his physical strength allows.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Democratic Socialist Party will issue an important declaration on the current situation in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Conner Will Return to the United States</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] Conner, the spokesman for the American Embassy, ​​is about to go to Shanghai to return to the United States at the call of the Secretary of State.</p>
<h3>The Government's Foreign Exchange Policy Will Not Be Changed at Present</h3>
<p>Minister Peng's Reply to Reporters' Questions [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] Minister Peng said at a press conference in the afternoon of the 16th that the government's foreign exchange policy will not be changed. Peng's statement was made in response to a reporter's question, "What is the government's opinion on the National Federation of Commerce's proposal to ban the circulation of foreign currency and force the surrender of foreign currency at the statutory exchange rate to stabilize the currency value?"</p>
<h3>Sovereignty over the Xisha Islands Definitely Belongs to Our Country According to the Treaty of Tianjin</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] Relevant parties in our country have been meeting for days to study the issue of the Xisha Islands and prepare to thoroughly negotiate with the French side. According to the attached map of the Tianjin Treaty of 1885, the sovereignty of the islands clearly belongs to our country. However, France made a request in 1937, and later fell into the hands of the Japanese due to the war. After the victory, our army took over again. After our side's sovereignty was clearly announced, the French side made a request again. The islands themselves have little economic value, but they are of great importance to our national defense and shipping in the South Seas, so our side attaches great importance to them and is determined to investigate the sovereignty in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Navy Captain Executed for Corruption, Liu Naiyi Executed in Beiping, Sentenced in Court and Bound to Tianqiao for Execution</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 16th Dispatch] Liu Naiyi (Navy Captain), the director of the Pingjin Branch of the North China Naval Commissioner's Office, who was reported by the investigation team for corruption and sentenced to death, was executed by shooting in Beiping today. This is the first execution of corruption reported by the National Investigation Team. At 9:40 AM this morning, Liu was taken from the detention center of the Xingyuan Military Law Office. Liu was wearing a gray coat and black cloth shoes. He walked out of the prison cell in good spirits. He had no prior knowledge of being sentenced to death. As soon as he left the prison, two soldiers who had been lying in wait outside the door went forward and tied his arms behind his back. Liu realized something was wrong and was pushed to the judge Zhang Jieyi, who had set up a public case in the courtyard. His face was as white as paper. The judge immediately pronounced: "Liu Naiyi is sentenced to death for embezzling public property and deprived of his political rights for life. 29 catties and 14 taels of opium confiscated and destroyed, 100 boxes of medicines, 15 catties of culture balls, 80 taels of gold, a platinum diamond ring, and a house in Sui'anbo Hutong, Beiping, confiscated." He then announced that the death sentence would be carried out immediately and asked if he had anything to say. After hearing the sentence, Liu trembled and replied that he did not accept the sentence. The judge praised that Chairman Chiang had ordered that he be shot immediately. If there was a will, it could be forwarded on his behalf. Liu had nothing to say, only asking the judge to inform his family, "I hope they (Liu has three wives, one in Tianjin, two in Beiping, and has not been allowed to see them since his arrest) will live a good life, and he wants the children to study and sell things at home and move to the south to live." He also said, "Many of the confiscated things are my personal belongings." At this point, the official threw the vermilion pen on the ground and instructed the soldiers to tie him up firmly. They pushed him onto a truck. Liu could not stand and was half-lying on the front of the truck. He was escorted to Tianqiao execution ground. The crowd along the way was as thick as a wall, and shouts were endless. On the way, he encountered a funeral procession, and Liu nodded his head frequently. He was silent all the way. After arriving at the execution ground, two soldiers helped him get out of the car. After taking a few steps, he was ordered to kneel down facing the ground. The executioner fired a shot first, hitting the northern part of the body, and blood spurted from the collar of the coat. He fell to the ground, but his breath had not yet stopped, so two shots were fired. After his death, a subordinate of Liu, who did not reveal his surname, carried a coffin to the execution ground to collect the body. Liu's concubines in Beiping will extend the service of monks to transcend him. Liu was 44 years old, from Liaoyang, Northeast China. In addition to his wives and concubines, he also has two young sons.</p>
<h3>Marshall Greatly Disappointed That the CCP Did Not Participate in Constitution-Making</h3>
<p>[United News Agency, Washington, 15th Dispatch] General Marshall will take office as Secretary of State this week. Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has guaranteed that the Republican Party will support Marshall on important foreign policy issues in the coming months. Vandenberg argued last week for a change in China policy, saying the United States should support a coalition government of all parties and organizations other than the Chinese Communist Party to implement a new constitution. This clearly indicates that the United States will abandon Marshal's policy of not taking sides between the KMT and the CCP in China. According to a diplomatic authority, Vandenberg's suggestion that the United States support the Chinese parties who support constitutionalism and political training may conflict with the policies Marshal wants to implement in China. However, Marshal is greatly disappointed that the CCP has not participated in constitution-making in order to reorganize and expand the government, which is undeniable. Therefore, if the Communist Party insists on refusing to accept the new constitution, Marshal himself may also agree to the United States supporting another group in China.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] Democratic Senator Pepper spoke in the Senate today, opposing Vandenberg's advocacy of changing China policy, saying that Vandenberg, a close friend of Secretary of State Nellernas, made a speech in Lexington, advocating that the United States encourage a coalition government of all parties and organizations other than the CCP to implement a new constitution, which is very misleading. This view is inconsistent with General Marshall's proposal and is sufficient to unite the United States with the "reactionary fascists and corrupt elements" of feudalism. At that time, Vandenberg, the chairman of the meeting, did not respond to Bober's accusations.</p>
<h3>Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association, Chairman Chiang Will Serve as Chairman</h3>
<p>[United Press, Southern East, 16th Dispatch] According to today's newspaper, Chairman Chiang will serve as the Chairman of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee.</p>
<h3>Traitors Can Be Paroled, Only Those Who Have Truly Repented and Served More Than Half of Their Sentence Can Be Approved by the Judicial Authorities</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] Zhao Chen, President of the Capital High Court, said on the 16th: Traitors who have "merit" cannot be spared the law and obtain amnesty or commutation. Only in accordance with Article 77 of the Criminal Law, "Those who have been subjected to the execution of imprisonment and have real evidence of repentance, after more than ten years of life imprisonment, and after more than one-half of a fixed-term imprisonment, shall be submitted by the prison officials to the highest administrative agency of justice and may be granted parole. However, this limit does not apply to fixed-term imprisonment for less than one year." This will be the only opportunity for the traitors in prison to come out.</p>
<h3>Expected to Release 600 Prisoners in Accordance with the Amnesty Order</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Beiping, 15th Dispatch] The President of the Hebei Higher Court said that 600 prisoners from prisons in Hebei Province have been released on bail in accordance with the amnesty order.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th Dispatch] The Changchun District Court has now completed the investigation of the number of criminals who should be amnestied, and has notified the amnestied criminals to pay bail for release.</p>

<p>The defense lawyer in the military court is Lieutenant Colonel Marshter, assisted by Captain Krek Lemek. The prosecutor is Lieutenant Colonel Fitzgerald, and the deputy prosecutor is Captain Young.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 16th Dispatch] On the eve of the opening of the US military court trial of the "US military rape of a Chinese female student" case, a new Soviet businessman here submitted a complaint to the Foreign Affairs Department of the 11th War Zone of China, formally accusing two Chinese soldiers of threatening a maid with a pistol in his villa (near the racecourse five miles outside the city) on the afternoon of the 15th, forcing her to "do good deeds."</p>

I am deeply saddened to learn of the passing of General Sorden. During the First World War, the General succeeded General Stilwell as Commander of the US Army in the India-Burma Theater and Commander of the Chinese Army in India.

(2) Adapt to the requirements of the times. (3) Follow the needs of the people, and explain in detail the meaning of the ten major guidelines for policy.</p>
<h3>Chen Lifu on Marshall's Statement, Marshall Correctly Points Out Various Points of the Current Communist Party, Preventing Communist Conspiracy is Seeing as a Stubborn Element</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 15th Dispatch] Yesterday, the New York Times published an interview with Mr. Chen Lifu by the newspaper's reporter in Nanjing. When the New York Times reporter asked for his opinion on General Marshall's statement, Mr. Chen's answer was roughly as follows: After reading Mr. Marshall's frank and well-intentioned statement, my first thought is that Mr. Marshall has achieved quite a lot in his mission to China, promoting the unity of various parties in China (regrettably, the Communist Party did not participate in the National Assembly in the end), opening the National Assembly, and even passing a democratic constitution "that is completely in line with the principles established by various parties (including the Communist Party) in January last year." Mr. Marshall has made contributions to all of these. Secondly, I believe that Mr. Marshall has a fairly deep understanding of the China issue and has a very correct view of the Chinese Communist Party. However, if he could spend more time contacting responsible cadres and people from all walks of life in the Kuomintang, his understanding of the entire China issue might be more accurate. Thirdly, I believe that Mr. Marshall pointed out that the problem of the Chinese Communist Party is different from the problem of the American Communist Party, and reminded Americans not to use the view of the American Communist Party to view the Chinese Communist Party, which is also very appropriate. Fourthly, I believe that Mr. Marshall's pointing out that the Communist Party's "disregard for the facts" and "disregard for the suffering of the people" and its exclusive engagement in "very harmful and inflammatory" propaganda, as well as its attempts to overthrow the government and collapse the economy, is also very profound. Fifthly, I believe that Mr. Marshall pointed out that the Communist Party is a pure Marxist and "deliberately wants to establish a communist form of government," which is different from some Americans who mistakenly believe that the Communist Party is a land reformer. This is a very insightful view. Sixthly, I believe that Mr. Marshall's advocacy that China should conscientiously complete the work of democratic politics in accordance with the constitution in the future and welcome the participation of various parties in the government is an absolutely correct view.</p>
<p>What we regret and are ashamed of is that Mr. Marshall, as a friend of an allied country and an elderly man, made tireless efforts for China for thirteen months, but was still not understood by a small number of Chinese people, namely the Chinese Communist Party, who "deliberately distorted and slandered the actions, policies, and objectives of the US government, and disregarded the facts, disregarded the truth, and clearly intended to mislead the Chinese people and cause fierce anti-American sentiment in various countries around the world." After reading Mr. Marshall's words, "In this kind of public slander and complete disregard for the facts, it is difficult to remain silent. If we deny it, we must deny it every day. This is something that American officials cannot tolerate." It can be seen that he is sincerely distressed and bitter. However, those who are familiar with the Communist Party's tactics are not surprised by this. In the past twenty years, hasn't the CCP used the same method, or even ten or a hundred times more, to deliberately distort the actions, policies, and objectives of the National Government and the Kuomintang to its own government and compatriots. Misrepresent. Slander. Mislead the Chinese people and people from all over the world to arouse fierce anti-Chinese, anti-Chinese government and Kuomintang emotions. Taking myself as an example, I was actually the first to work hard for KMT-CPC cooperation at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, and I had already completed the initial work of cooperation with my own hands, but the person who has been most distorted, slandered, and sought after by the CCP so far is also me alone. Therefore, those who are familiar with the Communist Party's tactics should not be surprised by this. What I must frankly point out is that most of the Kuomintang representatives in the National Assembly were educated and influenced by British and American liberal ideas to varying degrees, that is, the so-called "reactionary elements" or "stubborn elements" that the CCP has maliciously propagated for a long time. In fact, they are the "progressive elements" or "free elements" who passed the democratic constitution "that is completely in line with the principles established by the various parties' Political Consultative Conference in January last year" at this National Assembly. The Communist Party is good at creating nouns to add to people, and its publicity methods are very skillful, so its influence is easy to make people dazzled and unclear, or even mistaken for the truth without knowing it. In fact, in the past twenty years, in China, all those who have exposed or prevented the Communist Party's conspiracy to subvert the government or "deliberately establish a communist form of government" have been regarded as "reactionary elements" or "stubborn elements."</p>
<p>The method scientists use to solve scientific problems is to have more contact with phenomena, analyze and study their content more, and then it is possible to discover facts that cannot be broken. Politicians should also use the same method to study or solve political problems. Mr. Marshall was able to discover "a very harmful and inflammatory fact" in the actions of the Communist Party because of his long-term stay in China for thirteen months, his wisdom and enthusiasm, and the scientific attitude and methods he adopted. Therefore, he was able to discover that "the stubborn Communist Party members will never hesitate to use drastic measures to achieve their goals," and that the Communist Party is an absolute Marxist, and that all its current words and deeds are means and policies, and its goal is "to establish a communist form of government in China, or to organize a British and American-style democratic government during the transitional period." As for the British and American-style democratic government, it is exactly in line with the ideals of the Three Principles of the People that our party has been striving for for decades, and it is also the government that will be produced according to the constitution passed by this National Assembly.</p>
<h3>Issues of Rights to the China Changchun Railway, China and the Soviet Union Are Currently in Negotiations in Beijing, US Bans Overseas Chinese from Going to Soviet-Controlled Ports in the Far East</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] There are various rumors about the negotiations on the issue of the China Changchun Railway's property rights. According to relevant sources, the only thing being conducted by China and the Soviet Union in the capital is informal talks. The Chinese side participating in the negotiations includes the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Communications. The Ministry of Communications is represented by Ling Hongxun. It is heard that the main crux of the negotiations is that the two sides have different opinions on the valuation method of the property rights.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 16th Dispatch] Newton, a reporter for the Scripps-Howard system who recently revealed that the Soviet Union sent a note to US ships in Dalian, ordering them to withdraw within a time limit, today sent a message from Shanghai again, saying: The US Navy has clearly ordered American reporters and businessmen not to board warships to any Far Eastern port under Soviet control. According to Newton, this ban was issued by the Naval Operations Bureau in Washington. "This action is clearly the result of the Greater Dalian Incident." He also said: He learned of this order from Mike, an official enforcing the order at the US Consulate in Shanghai. The Navy Department's order invisibly dispels the purpose of the January 6 note sent by the United States to China and the Soviet Union, which hoped that Dalian would return to normal immediately so that American citizens could travel to and reside in Dalian to "engage in their legitimate activities."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Subsidiary 16th Dispatch] The Communist army constantly attacked the National Army's position in Puguandian every night. The National Army was clearing the nearby mountains.

Because the National Army's position is still about two miles away from the street, we are waiting for diplomatic negotiations before taking active action.</p>

<h3>Nationalist Troops Concentrated Around Yongji; Communist Offensive Collapses; Zhao Jiaxiang Claims Communist Intention Is to Seize Grain and Destroy Roads</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 16th] Sun Liren's troops around Changchun and Yongji have concentrated, and the Communist offensive has collapsed. Zheng Dongguo flew to Changchun at 8:00 AM on the 16th to command. Zhao Jiaxiang flew back to Shenyang at dusk on the 15th. According to him, the Communist offensive has been thwarted. He flew over the Songhua River and the Jilin-Changchun Road and the Communist advances and saw groups of vehicles and horses transporting materials northward, mostly grain. Furthermore, according to people who came, the Communist forces have been conscripting very harshly recently, six men from each 甲, with no exceptions. The final judgment is that the Communist offensive this time is to seize grain and destroy the traffic on the Jilin-Changchun and Chinese-Changchun railways. [This Newspaper, Pan Yang, 16th] The battle of Changchun and Yongji is taking place in heavy snow. Nationalist reinforcements are arriving quickly, and the Communists can soon be driven back to the north bank of the Songhua River. Also, fierce fighting occurred in 河灣子 near Yongji.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Beijing, 16th] Military figures here have recently commented on the news of the fighting northwest and northeast of Changchun, saying: There is absolutely no danger of Changchun being surrounded. There are no large-scale battles currently taking place in the Northeast. The Communist forces are only testing the strength of the Nationalist troops' positions in various places, as the Communist forces are deeply afraid that the Nationalist troops may launch an offensive towards Harbin in late winter or early spring. Nong'an northwest of Changchun and Dehui northeast of Changchun are currently in the hands of the government forces. It is rumored that many Communist forces are gathered north of Yongji, but they are not surrounding the city, nor will the Communists likely do so. In short, the current activities of the Communist forces are a strategy of feinting east and attacking west to prevent Harbin from being attacked.</p>

<h3>The Yellow River Control Project Reaches a Critical Juncture; Blocking the Breach Must Not Be Delayed; Minister Peng Explains the Reasons to Reporters</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference at 4:00 PM today in the department's conference room. Regarding the Communist Party's request to postpone the completion of the Huayuankou Yellow River breach closure by five months, Minister Peng Xuepei made the following explanation when answering reporters' questions:</p>
<p>The initial work of controlling the Yellow River has now reached a critical juncture. This project has several important reasons to prevent delays. The breach closure is expected to be completed soon, allowing the river to return to its original course in 1938. This project plan has long been known to the whole country and the world, and innovative measures have been taken. Currently, it is necessary to block the 170-meter breach twenty kilometers east of Zhengzhou. This is the remaining part of the total 400-meter breach. The remaining 230 meters has been filled with stones, rising above the water surface. Why is it inconvenient to postpone this project, which is just one basket short of completion? The reasons are as follows.</p>
<h3>Detailed Explanation; Three Reasons</h3>
<p>(1) The method of blocking the breach is to use flat closure. First, 119 rows of wooden stakes are driven, four stakes per row, deep into the main stream. Wooden boards are then laid on top to form a bridge. Narrow-gauge rails are laid on the bridge surface for transporting stones and throwing them into the river. If the work is stopped midway, the wooden stakes and stones may be washed away at any time. Even if only the current height of the stone dam is to be maintained, stones must continue to be thrown in during the shutdown period to supplement the washed-away parts. This is a waste of materials and manpower. The 洋松 timber used is imported from the United States, and the stones need to be transported from other places by rail. (2) The current water level is still low, and the average flow rate is only about 1,000 cubic meters per second. If this situation continues for a long time, the "凌汛" will arrive in early February, and the force of the ice can cut off the banks. Even if it can resist the impact of the 凌汛, the "桃汛" will come in late March, and the flow rate will reach 4,000 cubic meters per second. It is estimated that the banks will be in danger when the flow rate in Shaanxi County exceeds 1,500 cubic meters per second. When the "秋汛" comes at the end of July, the peak flow rate will reach 30,000 cubic meters per second, which is the most dangerous period of the year. Therefore, the most suitable season for construction is only from mid-October to the end of January. (3) After the breach is closed, the river water can flow into its old course. The amount of water gradually increases from spring to autumn. Engineers have ample time to observe the actual route taken by the Yellow River in its original riverbed. The waterway meanders between the north and south banks, sometimes reaching several kilometers apart. They can take advantage of this time to strengthen the weak parts of the downstream river堤. If the Communist Party's request to delay the project by five months is granted, the completion of the breach closure will be far from the 秋汛, and there is a risk of breaches in the river堤 below Hebei and Shandong, causing unimaginable harm to the people.</p>
<h3>Relocation of Riverbed Residents Facilitated</h3>
<p>The Chinese Communists are spreading propaganda saying: People who moved to the old course during the War of Resistance will suffer losses. It is difficult for us to give a definitive answer. There are no permanent houses built in the riverbed, only temporary shacks that are easy to move. Everyone knows that the Yellow River must eventually be returned to its old course. Therefore, the propaganda of the Chinese Communists is inevitably exaggerated. Or it is said that when the river is forced to return, millions of residents will be washed away. This is even more alarming. According to the initial survey figures submitted by the Chinese Communists, only 150,000 residents need to be relocated. Currently, one-tenth of the Yellow River water has flowed into the old course. The flow rate is only one 华里 per hour, and the depth is less than one meter. The speed is slower than human walking. A huge amount of water is first absorbed by the dry riverbed, and then the remaining water can move forward. Even after the entire river is diverted, it will not immediately become a turbulent flood.</p>
<p>Currently, the relief fund distribution team jointly formed by the government, the Chinese Communists, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is distributing relief funds along the old riverbed to the affected people. Each person can receive 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In 1938, when the Yellow River was diverted, about 6.1 million people were affected. After the breach is closed, they can all return to their homes, and food production is expected to increase dramatically.</p>
<h3>Yellow Flood Zone Refugee Group Calls for Early Breach Closure</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 15th] Refugees and fellow villagers from the Yellow Flood Zone who fled to Bianyuan organized a refugee group to march and petition in opposition to the Chinese Communist Party's policy of obstructing the breach closure, calling for the completion of the breach closure so that they can return to their hometowns as soon as possible. It was recently learned that the Chinese Communist Party is still insisting on immediately closing the diversion canal and stopping the breach closure work. Therefore, a meeting was convened on the afternoon of the 15th, and it was resolved: (1) To send separate telegrams to the Chairman of the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Party Headquarters, calling on the central government.</p>
<h3>Zhao Shouyu Arrives in Zhengzhou to Supervise Breach Closure Project</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 15th] Zhao Shouyu, Chairman of the Yellow River Commission, came to Zhengzhou on the 14th. In the afternoon, he accompanied Dawa and more than ten other representatives of Mongolia, who were returning west via Zhengzhou, to Huayuankou to visit the breach closure project. According to Zhao, he came to supervise the project and will not return to Bian for the time being.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Post-Disaster Construction Conference in the Yellow Flood Zone Return to Bian After Inspection</h3>
<p>Very Satisfied with All Facilities</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 15th] After the conclusion of the Post-Disaster Construction Conference in the Yellow Flood Zone on the 11th, the participating representatives and experts went to inspect areas in Fuyou, Zhongmu, and other counties in the flood zone and returned to Bian today. It is reported that the representatives were very satisfied with all the facilities in the flood zone. However, they are concerned that after the breach closure is completed, a large number of refugees from the flood zone who have fled to various places will inevitably return to their hometowns. Before the production capacity of the flood zone is restored, the food problem will inevitably be very serious and measures should be taken to solve it quickly.</p>
<h3>Sun Lianzhong Returns to Beiping by Special Plane; States that Xiong Shihui and Zhang Zhizhong's Visit to Nanjing Had Missions; All External Rumors Are Unreliable</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beijing, 16th] Sun Lianzhong flew back to Beiping by special plane at 2:30 PM today. When he met with a reporter from this newspaper, he said: (1) The authorities are indeed considering changing the war zone to a pacification command to unify it, but there is no concrete decision yet. All rumors about changes in military and political personnel in North China are inaccurate. He also said: Xiong Shihui's visit to Nanjing was to discuss the issue of transporting grain and teams from the Northeast, and Zhang Zhizhong's visit to Nanjing was to discuss the reorganization of the army in Xinjiang. The rumors about Xiong and Zhang are all unreliable. (2) The situation in Nanjing is dull, and there is no progress in peace talks. North China can only maintain the status quo because the overall direction of the country is uncertain. The Chief Executive's Office has not yet fully moved to Baoding due to the lack of housing in Baoding and the fact that the railways and highways have not been safely and smoothly opened. The restoration of traffic on the Pinghan Railway is progressing step by step due to complex conditions such as a lack of materials and security forces. The restoration of the railway between Yuanshi and Anyang also awaits a change in the overall situation. (3) Hebei Province has no income because it is a pacification zone. The annual administrative expenses are 50 billion short. It is expected that after consulting with President Song during this trip to Nanjing, the budget will be re-drafted. Sun said at the end: He will soon go to Tangshan and other places in Eastern Hebei for inspection.</p>

<h3>The Development of Yingkou Gradually Begins; Sea Transportation Outlets Must Be Opened Urgently</h3>
<p>[Report from our Yingkou Office, 15th] Yingkou City is now gradually moving towards development. The China Textile Company has opened 30,000 spindles. The Yingkou Paper Mill produces approximately one ton of "semi-gloss" paper every day. The Yingkou Saltworks is repairing its substation. The salt fields require seawater to be pumped. The salt-drying fields are vast in scale and have light railways. The highest annual production is 6,000,000 dan, which can supply the nine provinces and two cities of Northeast China.</p>
<p>According to Yingkou Mayor Sun, the city currently has a population of 200,000, with 20 primary schools and 4 secondary schools. The biggest difficulties at present are imperfect personnel systems and financial difficulties. All construction will be started as much as possible, and financial resources will rely on business and fishing tax revenues. The reporter, standing on the junction of the Chenjie Liao River and the coast, contemplated the opening of a Northeast sea transportation outlet from Yingkou, which is of great importance to the Northeast's economy and military affairs, and requires the joint construction of local and central governments.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Plea for the Vietnamese Overseas Chinese!</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of armed conflict in Vietnam, we have been concerned about the development of the situation in Vietnam, and for the safety of the lives and property of more than 400,000 overseas Chinese, we have always hoped that the Franco-Vietnamese conflict can be resolved peacefully. However, up to now, there is no possibility of realizing what we have hoped for. After the French reinforcements poured into Vietnam, the French army launched an offensive on the front lines; on the Viet Minh side, this is the liberation movement of Vietnam, and it will not stop until the goal is achieved. Viet Minh President Ho Chi Minh issued a statement on the 15th, also reiterating: "The Vietnamese people will fight to the end." Therefore, judging from the attitudes of both France and Vietnam, there is little hope that the Franco-Vietnamese conflict will end soon.</p>
<p>However, "when the city gate catches fire, the fish in the moat suffer." If the war in Vietnam does not stop for a day, the safety of the lives and property of the overseas Chinese in Vietnam will not be guaranteed for a day. How can we sit idly by and watch these poor and helpless overseas Chinese without saving them!? In particular, the Hanoi Overseas Chinese district, after being occupied by the Viet Minh army, was surrounded by the French army and completely isolated from the outside world. Food and drinking water have become a problem, not only causing panic in material life, but also the French army may launch a large-scale counterattack at any time, and the threat of airplanes and artillery is pressing on every overseas Chinese. How can they not be in danger?</p>
<p>Vietnamese overseas Chinese representatives Yan Renfu and Yang Wenzhong rushed back to their motherland to petition the government to demand emergency protection for the overseas Chinese. The day before yesterday, they hosted colleagues in Shanghai to explain the five demands of the overseas Chinese to the motherland government: (1) Emergency relief to the overseas Chinese in Vietnam; (2) Dispatch government officials to Vietnam to appease the overseas Chinese and investigate the losses; (3) Order the French and Vietnamese parties to compensate for the losses; (4) Request the Vietnamese side to release the arrested overseas Chinese and to release the overseas Chinese who are stranded on the way in various places so that they can return to the cities; (5) Send planes to transport rice and medicine to relieve the besieged overseas Chinese, and immediately use the plane to carry women and children back to the country.</p>
<p>These demands are indeed the most effective way to provide emergency relief to the Vietnamese overseas Chinese. The government has an unshirkable responsibility to protect overseas Chinese, and should quickly take effective emergency measures, and must not let the overseas Chinese who are suffering in Vietnam be disappointed again. Whenever we mention the grievances suffered by overseas Chinese in foreign countries, we always feel that it is impossible to describe them all. It is a sad history that cannot be told. In the past, we blamed the weakness of the country for not having the power to protect overseas Chinese in their industrial and commercial activities overseas; but today, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, no matter what, the international status has finally improved. When our representatives speak at the successive international conferences, the great powers have to respect our opinions and give them special attention. If our diplomatic authorities can use it properly, then protecting the legitimate interests of overseas Chinese abroad is within their capacity, especially protecting the safety of the lives and property of overseas Chinese, which can be considered no problem. Taking the Vietnam incident as an example! Yuan Shijian, our Consul General in Hanoi, has done his best to protect the overseas Chinese, and has repeatedly made suggestions to both France and Vietnam, advocating the division of a neutral zone in Vietnam for overseas Chinese and peace-loving Vietnamese people to live in, but this security plan has not been realized. We deduce the reason, in fact, because our government has failed to give Consul General Yuan Zijian sufficient power to argue according to reason and achieve this. This makes us have to express considerable regret to the diplomatic and overseas Chinese affairs authorities.</p>
<p>Past events cannot be changed, but future events can be rushed. The most urgent issue at present is for the government to quickly take concrete and effective measures to protect overseas Chinese. The five demands put forward by the overseas Chinese representatives should be given serious consideration. There is no hope for a peaceful resolution of the Franco-Vietnamese conflict for a while, and more than 400,000 overseas Chinese are in danger, and they are expecting emergency aid from the two countries at all times; the situation is urgent, and the government must not turn a blind eye, or calmly discuss and listen to the hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese who cannot get the protection of their motherland and die. The two measures approved by the Executive Yuan, (1) Allocate 2 million Vietnamese currency to relieve the overseas Chinese in North Vietnam; (2) The relevant departments will organize an investigation team to go to North Vietnam to investigate the losses suffered by the overseas Chinese. We always think that it is still not enough. A mere 2 million Vietnamese currency is like a drop in the bucket, and it is still of no help! Investigation is a post-event nature, and this move is definitely not enough to protect the safety of overseas Chinese! In short, we hope that the government cannot ignore the safety of the lives and property of Vietnamese overseas Chinese, and should quickly take effective emergency measures, on the one hand, to rescue the endangered overseas Chinese in Vietnam, and on the other hand, to comfort the overseas Chinese in other places!</p>
<p>Technical Guidance</p>
<p>The Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office recently has a proposal to organize a technical committee, whose task is to assist factories in solving technical problems with the voluntary assistance of several industrial experts. This move is very commendable. Because the decline of current production is due to the lack of technology, which is indeed one of the reasons. Either there are too few such specialized talents to recruit, or the scale is too small to recruit such talents, so it is indeed a very necessary and valuable work for the public to provide experts, do their duty, and solve technical problems for factories.</p>
<p>Government agencies have never lacked superficial assistance to factories. For example, support, reward, conservation, and promotion are all familiar terms. But how much actual benefit can manufacturers get? This seems to be another question. We have indeed heard manufacturers complain: It would be enough if the government caused us less trouble; we don't expect them to give us much help. Originally, following those nice-sounding nouns, there would be a series of procedures and forms distributed, and each would make its own form and set its own procedures, although they were largely the same, they went their separate ways. In many places, they were also prepared very delicately, and if there were no specialized talents and a long period of time, it would be difficult to deal with. Sometimes, a committee was specially sent to question, investigate, and inspect documents face-to-face, and had to accept, entertain, and accompany the inspection. And the final result was not to add many useless data to their archives? After the event, it is considered a success if a statistical figure can be seen, and many investigation forms do not even have a statistical figure. As for the general work at ordinary times, no matter what the purpose is, it is always more of a suppression and restriction component and lacks the actual benefits and enthusiasm of encouragement and support. Therefore, it is still a matter worth writing about to send experts to design and improve factories, solve difficulties, and never charge fees.</p>
<p>Some people believe that the urgent need of the industrial sector at present is not only a technical matter. With factories, there are no raw materials; to buy raw materials, there is a lack of funds; when manpower and raw materials are all ready, there is no sufficient electricity; if you are lucky enough to start work, the sales of products are often blocked by low-priced foreign goods; in addition, the interest on loans is frighteningly high, and wages are increasing day by day; old taxes are not removed, and new taxes are coming one after another; just the transportation, loading, and unloading costs are equal to the water feet between Shanghai and the United States; if these cannot be improved, what is the use of simply improving technology? These words are indeed facts, and we do not deny them. But technology is technology, and it cannot be confused with these problems. As the saying goes: focus on the big picture, start with the small things, not to mention that technical problems cannot be regarded as small things?</p>
<p>I heard a certain gentleman in the textile industry say: China's textile machinery and technology are thousands of years behind the United States, thousands of years behind Japan, and even several years behind India. Taking this as an example, it can be seen that even if these many problems can be solved, if the technical aspects cannot catch up and catch up quickly, then the future of China's industry is still not optimistic.</p>
<p>Taking export goods as an example: many products cannot meet the standards of overseas markets, so returns are often heard and sales are decreasing day by day. Although there are still reasons for mixing in fraud, etc., the fact that the technology is too poor to compete with others is naturally a main reason.</p>
<p>As for the fact that foreign goods are flooding the market and Chinese people do not like to use domestic goods, the only excuse is that the quality is too poor and the effectiveness is too low. In seeking the reasons, in addition to the raw material problem, we have to attribute the main reason to technology. Therefore, improving technology is not only one of the means to save industry, but also a crucial way to promote domestic goods and maintain exports. It is hoped that the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office can implement this new proposal without any slackness, and completely wash away the shame of the official from the past who has been useless, and also hope that manufacturers will make the most of it and not live up to this kindness.</p>

<h3>Amnesty Decree Issued to the Higher and District Courts of Suzhou; Released Prisoners Begin to be Released; It is Said that They Weep with Joy When Released from Prison; the Poor Will Also Be Assisted</h3>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou Office, 16th] The National Government's amnesty decree was received by the prosecutor's offices of the Higher and District Courts here on the 16th. All those who meet the provisions of item A of the amnesty regulations, whose most serious original sentence is imprisonment or less, will be released uniformly, and the rest will have their sentences reduced separately. The two courts immediately reviewed the cases and released prisoners this afternoon, including three from the Higher Court and more than 200 from the District Court, including fraud, kidnapping, embezzlement, theft, opium, intimidation, and counterfeit currency criminals. Our reporter made a special trip to Jiangsu First Prison to visit the amnesty and release situation, and happened to see four officials from the District Court Prosecutor Xiao Qi, etc., explaining the government's virtue of amnesty to the prisoners in batches by name, encouraging them to be new citizens, and warning them not to have narrow-minded revenge behavior. The prisoners were extremely grateful, and some wept with joy. It is learned that: The First Prison is detaining more than 300 prisoners from the District Court, of which more than 200 are fully amnestied and more than 100 have their sentences reduced. Later, due to lack of time, Wu Kegen and other twelve were released first, and the rest will be released on the 17th. As for the vast majority of traitors, there is no hope of amnesty or reduction, and even if there is, it still needs to be sorted out by the Higher Court. The reporter talked with Warden Chen Songnian about the recent situation of Chen Bijun, the traitor, and was told that she has been able to adapt to prison life, and now there are no servants, and fires are not allowed in the room for heating. Only food and drink are still delivered by relatives in Suzhou on a meal-by-meal basis. It seems that the female traitor of the generation will end her life with the flavor of iron windows!</p>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou Office] After the National Government issued the amnesty decree, there were quite a few prisoners detained in all prisons and detention centers of the Higher and District Courts of Suzhou who met the amnesty conditions. However, most of the criminals were forced by life to take risks, resulting in violations of criminal law. Now that they are released, and it is now the end of the year, with severe cold, and without food or clothing, it will inevitably increase social hidden dangers and affect local security. Now the Suzhou Lawyers Association and Xia Yi Society are jointly initiating the establishment of an amnesty prisoner protection association, modeled on the Shanghai Women's Prison Protection Association, to find ways to provide relief.</p>
<p>[Report from our Hangzhou Office, 16th] The Hangzhou City Council believes that there will be more than 600 criminals in the city this year who will be granted amnesty, and the lives of the pardoned criminals have become a problem. It has been resolved to send a letter to the city government and the court to discuss solutions to accommodate these criminals.</p>
<h3>Active Deployment of River Defense; Command Post Established in the Short Term; Transportation and Communication Improved Separately</h3>
<p>[Report from our Jiangyin Office] General Tang Enbo summoned the commanders of various districts to hold a meeting after arriving in Wuxi the day before yesterday. Commander Kong Qinggui of the fortress went to Wuxi on the morning of the 14th to participate. Commander Tang inquired in detail about the situation in various suppression areas, and gave many instructions on river defense matters. The most noteworthy is that if a bandit alarm occurs, if the Baojia chief of each area knows but does not report it, or if there is collusion, the Baojia chief should be jointly punished, and the commander can directly execute it. Also, the county magistrate in charge of the area has dereliction of duty, but the county magistrates are questioned. At about 4:00 PM, Commander Kong returned to Cheng and stepped up the planning of river defense. Because the defense line under his jurisdiction is the longest, it is urgent to deploy it so that the river defense command post can be established in the short term. In addition, Commander Kong believes that communication is extremely important, and specially telegraphed the county government to mobilize civilian laborers to be responsible for rebuilding the bridges from Beiwai Junshan along the Jinwu Road to Wushan. From Wushan to Hougang to Yangku Road (the section east of Yangku must be built to the border of Changshu Shangyuan), the county will allocate civilian laborers to repair it. The above two items must be completed before February 15th. The telephone from Beiwai Junshan along the Jinwu Road to Zhangjiagang is the responsibility of the county government and must be connected within the 20th of this month. The highway from Shengang via Liangshiqiao to Jiaoxi is the responsibility of the county government and must be completed before February 15th. The standard for bridge construction and repair of the above items is at least 5 tons of heavy load. The required expenses will be telegraphed by the headquarters to the provincial government for approval.</p>
<h3>The Bandits Are Bold; Robbing Grain Rice</h3>
<p>[Report from our Wuxing Office] The county's Tianliang Office received a provincial order on the 13th to hire civilian boats to load 250 large bags of grain rice and transport them to Hangzhou for storage. The boat passed the Qianjiatan area near Linghu, and it was already late. Suddenly, more than 20 bandits came, each holding long and short guns, shouting to stop and dock. The boat and the rice were all robbed. At the same time, two merchant ships passed by the area and were also looted. After the boatmen returned to the city to report, the military and police agencies sent a team to pursue them, but the bandits had disappeared without a trace.</p>
<h3>Huhu Ferry Robbed</h3>
<p>[Report from our Jiashan Office] The Huzhou-Shanghai ferry, Rongshu, was sailing through Qiandun Port, Xitang Town, which belongs to the county, at 3:30 AM on the 14th. More than 20 bandits ambushed there, firing more than a dozen shots and shouting to stop. Dozens of passengers were not spared. After three hours, it was dawn, and they dispersed into several boats and fled. It is reported that the loss reached 20 million yuan. Also, on the night of the 13th, a kiln cargo ship was sailing through Xiangfu Dang, north of Xitang. Suddenly, a small boat came with seven people, holding long and short guns, boarded the ship and looted. As a result, more than 100 yuan of clothes and miscellaneous items were robbed.</p>
<h3>Banditry on the Border of Jinpu Lan</h3>
<p>[Report from our Jinhua Office] Since winter, scattered bandits have been found from time to time in the border areas where the county borders Pujiang and Lanxi, forming groups of three or five, robbing travelers, and even robbing houses. It is reported that the authorities have paid attention to this and have telegraphed the nearby garrison troops and sent letters to the local self-defense teams to strictly monitor and prevent them.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Dispatch Peddlers; Buying Silver Dollars at High Prices</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nantong Office] The City Defense Headquarters reported that recently, the Communist troops dispatched a large number of peddlers to various markets to buy silver dollars at high prices (each silver dollar was exchanged for 2,300 to 2,400 yuan of legal tender) to make silver dollars flow into the Communist area in order to strengthen its economic foundation. Now the City Defense Headquarters has telegraphed the county government to order a ban.</p>
<h3>Fan Junbo Accused of Corruption After the Extortion Case</h3>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou Office, 16th] Wu District Prosecutor's Office summoned Fan Junbo, Wang Yangzhi, Wang Xianeng and others again on the morning of the 16th for interrogation in the famous local extortion case, which lasted four and a half hours. Our reporter inquired from various parties about the inside story of the re-investigation, and learned that another person, Zhu Mengzhen, accused Fan Junbo of committing a crime of corruption, which was not related to the 6 million yuan extortion case that has already been tried. It is heard that the District Prosecutor's Office has gained clues on this case and will formally announce the details of the case in the near future.</p>
<h3>Changlu Salt Sold to Bengbu and Xuzhou</h3>
<p>[Report from our Bengbu Office] The largest market for the concentration of salt in Anhui and Henan is Bengbu. However, since the start of the military uprising, the salt-producing areas in Huaibei have been affected by the war, and the output of various salt farms has decreased sharply, leading to a situation where supply cannot meet demand. In October last year, the salt affairs authorities allocated 356,000 dan of Huai salt for sale in northern Anhui, with a time limit of only three days. In the rush, many transporters here regretted not being able to participate, and there were complaints. Seeing that the warehouse inventory was insufficient, in order to maintain the people's food and increase tax revenue, the authorities decided to sell Changlu salt to the Bengbu and Xuzhou areas. In Bengbu City, it is stipulated that 400,000 dan should be allocated and transported. On the 12th, the salt affairs management branch ordered the Huai salt transporters to apply to the Lu Bureau. Now this quota has been undertaken by a few large merchants under assumed names. At this time of the end of the lunar year, the money market is extremely tight and sea transportation is scarce, making transportation a problem. It is heard that the authorities have set a time limit for compliance and do not allow delays. The transporters have telegraphed the salt administration authorities to allow the application procedures and the collection of salt tax to be transferred to the Salt Administration Bureau.</p>
<h3>Anonymous Salesman's Attack Exposed; Donation of Guns and Bullets Settles the Matter</h3>
<p>Yang Ruxun Brings Humiliation Upon Himself Out of Spite</p>
<p>[Report from our Wuxing Office] There is a businessman named Yang Ruxun in Wuzhen, who opened the Douhua Pharmacy in Xizha. He usually likes to pursue vanity. Recently, the Youth League District Team Department in the town expanded its recruitment of members. Yang believed that his ability was better than others, and hoped to obtain the position of squad leader after joining the League, so he happily joined. Unexpectedly, a League member named Cai obtained the title. As a result, jealousy arose, so on the afternoon of the 7th, he sent an anonymous letter to Chen Qizhe, a wine merchant in Beiji. The letter was full of descriptions of the misdeeds of Cai and five other League members. Chen was confused after seeing the letter, so he took the letter to Shen, the district team leader, to show the original letter. As a result, the handwriting was recognized, and there was no way to deny it. He had to admit it and bowed his head in acknowledgment. Cai and others had no intention of suing in court. Fortunately, someone came forward to mediate, and the lawsuit was settled. Yang apologized in the newspaper and volunteered to subsidize the team with four rifles and 240 bullets.</p>
<h3>The Year is Almost Over, the Imperial Exams are Over, and Spring Plowing is Approaching; The Problem of Cattle Shortage in Northern Jiangsu is Serious</h3>
<p>[Report from our Zhenjiang Office, 16th] The year is almost over, the winter is over, and spring plowing is approaching. However, the severe shortage of plowing cattle in the recovered areas of northern Jiangsu has become an extremely serious problem. It is heard that the Yanfu counties now have less than 100 plowing cattle. According to Chairman Wang's report, he only saw two plowing cattle and one wild dog on the 120 li journey from Dongtai to Yancheng. The situation is miserable, like the abdomen sand Han. In the future, if we cannot address the reality and provide a large number of plowing cattle, seeds, and agricultural implements to the rural areas of northern Jiangsu, the consequences will be disastrous.</p>
<h3>Huoqiu, Yingshang, and Shouxian; Huaihe Dike Resumes Work Successively</h3>
<p>[Report from our Zhengyangguan Office] The Huaihe dikes in Huoqiu, Yingshang, and Shouxian have resumed work successively. In order to clarify the details, the reporter specially visited Zhu Jiadong, the chief engineer of the third section of the Huaihe River Dike Engineering Bureau of the Huaihe River Guidance Committee in this city. According to him, the Huaihe dike project in this section (including Huoqiu, Yingshang, and Shouxian) is all the responsibility of this section. This section has four supervisory offices. The first supervisory office is responsible for the dike section from Hongjiayoufang to the Xinshai River mouth on the right bank of the Huaihe tributary Weihe River, and started construction on December 25th. The second supervisory office is responsible for the dike project from Fengjiawei to Niuweigang, which started in early December and has completed 20,500 cubic meters of earthwork. The third supervisory office is responsible for the dike project from Mohekou to Lukouzi in Yingshang County, which started in late December and has completed 2,500 cubic meters of earthwork. The fourth supervisory office is responsible for the dike project in Huoqiu County on the left bank of the Weihe River, which started on January 1st. Recently, I also met Yu Gu, the director of the Zhengyangguan supply station of the Anhui Relief Sub-Bureau. He told me that since the start of construction, a total of 46,000 catties of earthwork relief powder and 9,900 catties of food were issued to the workers, and 2,540 catties of food were supplemented for the suspension of work due to rain and snow.</p>
<h3>Northern Zhejiang Garrison District; Population of 7 Million; About One-Third are Eligible Young Men</h3>
<p>[Report from our Hangzhou Office, 15th] Xia Jiping, the commander of the Northern Zhejiang Garrison District, met with reporters yesterday and said that the district governs 28 counties and 1 city in the Jiaxing, Hangzhou, and Jiande three regimental districts, and the temporary conscription quota can generally be met. Last year, there were 7 cases of hindering military service. Starting from the 36th year, it is planned to combine the investigation of young men with the household registration investigation to ensure fairness in the examination of exemption from military service. This year, the new conscription law stipulates that those who are exempted from military service are only those whose age may be 21 to 25 years old in the current year at the time of conscription. Also, the population of this garrison district is 7 million, and the eligible young men are about 1%, and the active soldiers are about several thousand.</p>
<p>[Report from our Hangzhou Office] The temporary conscription quota for Hangzhou City in the 35th year is 680 people, and 393 people have been conscripted. The 186 students recruited by the Taiwan Wheel Gas National and Aviation School's Special Service Brigade in the city are allowed to offset the quota. Therefore, Hangzhou City only needs to conscript 31 more young men to fully meet the quota.</p>

<h3>Impersonating to Stop Ships and Extort Money; Huang Shouxuan and Others Apprehended</h3>
<p>[Report from our Jiangyin Office] Huang Shouxuan, Huang Faji, Huang Zhiming, Yan Baojun and others from Rugao, in the name of the No. 12 District Fundraising Committee of the county, falsely claimed to solicit money from cargo ships in the Huangtiangang Dingqing area. This has happened more than once. On the 12th, they demanded 100,000 donations per piglet from Ding Xiuting and other Jiangbei pig merchants, a total of 82 piglets, requiring 8.2 million. Later, they settled at the Nanyang Hotel for a total of 2.5 million. Because there was no cash, a postdated check was written. The Dingqing Civil Defense Team investigated and took one thousand people to the team headquarters. A certificate from the Rugao County Encouragement Widow Committee was found, addressed to Huang Lanru, a female, which was a false name used to solicit money. They immediately sent a document to the county government for handling.</p>
<h3>The Harmful Effects of Wenzhou Flower Gambling: A Gambling Woman Hangs Herself</h3>

<h3>People from All Walks of Life in Haining Call For a Halt to Demolishing Embankments and Building Dams</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this newspaper in Haining] It is well known that the seawall on the north bank of the Qiantang River is most important in this county. Since the establishment of the Seawall Works Bureau, it has gathered both domestic and foreign Yongli experts who have successively visited Haining to inspect and discuss the seawall construction plan, but it has not yet been officially implemented. Recently, the bureau announced that it had decided to demolish the complete large stone embankment in the Jiubao area to build a water diversion dam for testing. People from all walks of life in this county believe that the tidal force in that area is the strongest, and the spring floods are approaching. If the water diversion dam test fails and the large stone embankment is no longer there, the tides will overflow. What will protect us? How can the lives of the seven counties be used as a gamble for a new engineering test? Therefore, they cannot remain silent and have risen up to appeal. The County Council has telegraphed Provincial Chairman Shen Fang, requesting that he immediately instruct the engineering institutions to pay attention to the safety of the seawall. If there is no absolute certainty, they should first consider internal protection to prevent collapse and avoid harming the lives of the seven counties.</p>
<h3>Fishing Boats Arrive in Succession: Food Supply in Yuhuan Out of Balance</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this newspaper in Yuhuan] This county is a food-deficient area, and every year it relies entirely on Yueqing and Wenling counties for food supply. Recently, with the Lunar New Year approaching and the weather being cloudy, cold, and drizzly, the supply of food in the market has become scarce. Merchant fishing boats have successively come from Zhou and other places to dock in the Kanmen Jiaochangtou area of the fishing district, increasing consumption by an uncertain amount. As a result, prices have risen rapidly. Rice, which originally cost around three catties per thousand yuan, has now risen to around two catties, and the price is still rising. The average small citizen has no...</p>

<h3>Thoroughly Eliminate Opium and Narcotics in Recovered Areas: Regulations on Quitting and Rehabilitation Jointly Issued by the Ministry of Interior, Executive Yuan, and Ministry of Health</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] A spokesperson for the Anti-Smoking Committee of the Ministry of Interior stated: During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese invaders vigorously implemented a drug policy in our occupied areas, forcing and condoning our people to use and traffic in opium and narcotics, using every means possible. After the victory, according to estimates from various investigations, there were as many as 32 million opium addicts in the recovered areas. How to rehabilitate this vast national force and carry out national reconstruction after the war is a problem that urgently needs to be solved. Therefore, providing rehabilitation and relief to opium addicts is an urgent matter. The Ministry of Interior, the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the Ministry of Health have jointly discussed and formulated twelve articles of "Implementation Regulations for Handling Opium Addicts' Rehabilitation and Relief Affairs in Recovered Areas," which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and filing. They have now been sent separately to the provincial and municipal governments and relief branches for implementation. The implementation regulations are as follows:</p>

<h3>The French Political Situation Enters a New Stage: Auriol Elected President, Supported Unanimously by the Communist Party, Blum's Successful Visit to England May Lead to Reappointment as Prime Minister</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 16th Broadcast: French Socialist leader and President of the National Assembly Vincent Auriol has been elected President of the Fourth French Republic. Auriol, in his capacity as President, will appoint a new Prime Minister to succeed Leon Blum, who temporarily served as French Prime Minister to navigate the economic crisis. [Report from this newspaper] London, 16th Broadcast, Paris: The French Communist Party has announced that it will support Socialist Vincent Auriol as a candidate for President of the Fourth Republic when the National Assembly holds a meeting at Versailles. The Communist Party holds 163 seats in the Lower House and the Socialist Party holds 93 seats; the Communist Party holds 78 seats in the Upper House and the Socialist Party holds 51 seats. The total number of votes for the two parties is 385, and the total number of votes for the two Houses is 895.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 16th] The Senate and House of Representatives of Congress will be busy this afternoon in Versailles electing the first President of the Fourth Republic. The Socialist Party elected Vincent Auriol as its candidate last night. The Communist Party will explain its position when Congress opens. Although it knows that it has no chance of nominating a president, it will still nominate Giacinto as a candidate to show its stance. The Radical Socialist Party does not intend to nominate Herriot and will propose the little-known Gasse as a candidate. The Right-wing Liberal Party candidate is Clemenceau. The People's Republican Party finally elected Li Pei as a candidate because de Gaulle was unwilling to participate in the election. Li Pei was elected Speaker of the Senate this week.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 15th] The Anglo-French agreement to conclude a treaty of alliance is considered here to be a major diplomatic achievement for Prime Minister Blum, and the chances of Blum serving as the first formal Prime Minister of the Fourth Republic have greatly increased. According to the constitution, the interim President and Prime Minister will resign after the formal President is elected on the 16th. Before the Anglo-French statement was announced, Blum's political reputation was already good, due to the 5% reduction in prices. Initial impressions in Paris regarding this statement have been favorable.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 15th] The committee of various parties in the French National Assembly recently held a meeting under the chairmanship of the Speaker and immediately unanimously passed a resolution proposing to the parliament that the election of the President of the French Republic should adopt two methods: secret ballot and absolute majority. It is generally believed that all parties have expressed their agreement on this and it is hoped that the parliament will pass it without any amendments. [French News Agency, Paris, 16th] General Manager Bertaux of the French Public Works Department has now been appointed as the French Governor-General of Tunisia to replace General Mast.</p>
<h3>England and France to Conclude a Treaty of Alliance to Prevent Germany from Threatening Peace Again, Completing the Linkage of the Triangular Alliance Relationship, Blum Returned to Paris from England Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 16th Broadcast: French Prime Minister Blum arrived at the Paris airfield by plane from London at 12:10 pm today, carrying a draft Anglo-French alliance, and attended the joint session of the two Houses to elect a president at 2 pm.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] After Prime Minister Blum arrived here to hold two days of talks with Prime Minister Attlee and Foreign Minister Bevin, the two sides agreed to negotiate and conclude an alliance. The communique from 10 Downing Street stated: The United Kingdom and France have agreed to conclude a treaty of alliance as soon as possible to prevent Germany from continuing its aggression and to ensure peace and security. This alliance will not go beyond the scope of Article 53 of the United Nations Charter. Negotiations on Belgian affairs will begin as soon as possible. Political observers here believe that the Anglo-French negotiations on this matter are the most important event in the history of the two countries. If the negotiations progress smoothly, the signing of the alliance can complete the linkage of the post-war European triangular treaty relationship. This relationship began with the Anglo-Soviet alliance in May 1942, followed by the Franco-Soviet alliance in February 1944. Therefore, if there is another Anglo-French alliance, the three European powers can complete the triangular alliance relationship.</p>
<h3>Joint Communique Issued</h3>
<p>The full text of the joint communique issued by 10 Downing Street is as follows: Prime Minister Blum's visit to London has provided an opportunity for a joint review and exchange of views on various issues of common interest to the two countries, as well as various other issues. The policy towards Germany has been thoroughly reviewed. During the review, both sides recognized that for the sake of the interests of the two countries, effective steps should be taken to prevent Germany's economic recovery from becoming a threat to world peace again. During the discussion, it was further recognized that France's economic recovery requires the import of more coal, and increasing coal production in the Ruhr region is a major factor in European recovery. During the discussion, it was recognized that both countries had been attacked by Germany twice in 25 years and have the same interests in defending themselves against future German aggression. For this reason, both sides agreed to conclude a treaty of alliance as soon as possible within the scope of Article 53 of the United Nations Charter to prevent future German aggression and ensure peace and security. The two governments further believe that the conclusion of this alliance will facilitate the resolution of all issues between the two countries in a spirit of mutual understanding. Since the two countries have close ties in industry and commerce, they agreed to instruct the representatives of the two countries in the Anglo-French Economic Committee to immediately review the two countries' recovery and innovation plans to avoid conflicts. The committee will meet in Paris in the coming days to provide an opportunity for full implementation of the Monnet Plan. After the British government's economic white paper has been debated by Parliament, talks will be held again as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>The British Foreign Office Denies Abandoning the Anglo-Soviet Treaty, the Soviet Newspaper Distorts Bevin's Speech</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 15th] The Soviet political organ newspaper "Pravda" recently published an article criticizing British Foreign Minister Bevin's speech on December 22, in which it said that the Anglo-Soviet Treaty had been abandoned. This statement has been denied by a spokesperson for the British Foreign Office, who said that the "Pravda" article was excerpted and taken out of context to become material for discussion. In fact, the Foreign Minister denied in his speech that Britain was bound by American policy and said that Britain was not bound by any policy other than the obligations stipulated in the Atlantic Charter. However, this does not mean that Britain will not fulfill its obligations under treaties signed with other countries. If the "Pravda" report is interpreted in this way, it means that Britain has not only abandoned the Anglo-Soviet Treaty, but also abandoned its treaties signed with other countries. This is completely inconsistent with the facts.</p>
<h3>Europe Will Have a New War Within Five Years</h3>
<p>Benes's prediction</p>
<p>[Reuters, Prague, 16th] Czech President Benes said in a speech here today that he expects a full-scale struggle against Nazism or fascism to occur in Europe within four to five years.</p>
<h3>The Four Foreign Undersecretaries' Meeting Decides to Allow Austria to Participate in Peace Treaty Discussions, France Clarifies its Position on the German Issue</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 16th Broadcast: The Four Foreign Undersecretaries' Meeting decided today that Austria should be consulted on the drafting of the Austrian Peace Treaty. At the same time, it was decided to rename the Austrian Peace Treaty the "Treaty on the Reconstruction of an Independent and Democratic Austria." US Representative Clark announced the withdrawal of the US draft peace treaty for Austria and will present a new draft treaty in a few days. The British draft treaty remains unchanged, and the French new draft treaty will be presented in one or two days.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia submitted a memorandum to the Four Foreign Undersecretaries' Meeting today, demanding that southern and central Carinthia be ceded to Yugoslavia, making Austria a small province.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, 15th] The Four Foreign Undersecretaries continued their meeting today and began discussing the German and Austrian peace treaties. The theme was the proposal put forward by the Australian representative, who advocated inviting the 18 relevant countries to attend and present their opinions. It was finally decided to invite representatives from Poland, the Netherlands, Yugoslavia, Australia, South Africa, and Canada to attend and present their opinions on the German and Austrian peace treaties, but the date will be decided later. In addition, the Four Foreign Undersecretaries' Meeting decided to discuss the Austrian issue in the morning session and then discuss the German issue in the afternoon session.</p>
<p>Divide Germany to Prevent Revival</p>
<p>[French News Agency, New York, 15th] Former French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bidault told a reporter from the New York Times today that France is the only country that has clearly stated its position on the German issue. France hopes that the Saar region will be independent, but must be economically and financially linked to France. As for politically, France does not want to have a relationship with it, because France knows that the 800,000 residents of the Saar region are all Germans. As for the Ruhr region, it should be independent and internationalized. The Rhineland should be separated from Germany and placed under the military control of the Allied forces. In short, Germany must be made a decentralized federal state. I believe that the coal mines in the Ruhr region should be developed under a system similar to the nationalization of British coal mines, so that the whole of Europe can benefit. The German people are a powerful and dangerous nation. The strength of Germany is only beneficial to itself, and there is no benefit to other countries. It would be foolish to think that Germany will change its original ideas after it becomes stronger again. That is why France hopes that Germany will become a federal state.</p>
<h3>Disarmament Issue: Postponed Discussion, Reconsidered in Three Weeks</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 16th] The United Nations Security Council today passed the American proposal to postpone the discussion on the disarmament issue for three weeks until February 4th, so that the governments of all member states can study the issue from various complex angles. Earlier, British representative Jebb expressed support for the American proposal, but advocated for a swift start to the work, while also emphasizing the importance of not sacrificing effectiveness. American representative Austin stated that he believed that before February 4th, they would be able to reach an agreement on the implementation of military reductions, and at that time, they also hoped for a closer agreement on the report of the Atomic Energy Commission. Austin continued, saying that the report of the Atomic Energy Commission should be discussed first, as this was the instruction of the United Nations General Assembly. Soviet representative Gromyko still stated that the General Assembly resolution was for the Security Council to promptly review the disarmament proposal, so he could not accept the American suggestion to postpone the discussion until February 4th. Polish representative Lange also expressed his firm opposition to delaying the discussion on the disarmament proposal. Finally, after a vote, the American proposal was passed.</p>
<h3>The Huge Fascist of Italy: Montana Still Lives</h3>
<p>Once rumored to be designated as Mussolini's successor...</p>
<p>He sentenced Mussolini's son-in-law, Ciano, to death...</p>
<p>He commanded the Blackshirt divisions to invade Albania...</p>
<p>He is at the top of the list of war criminals held in Yugoslavia...</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from a Correspondent in Italy, 15th] Montana, the short-lived leader of Mussolini's Social Republic who was once rumored to be designated as Mussolini's successor, has now changed his name and lives in seclusion in a remote Italian village. Montana served as the police chief of the Fascist Republic until the end of the war and was a judge in the Fascist court, sentencing Mussolini's son-in-law, Foreign Minister Ciano, to death. According to Montana, he was able to settle here with the help of powerful friends. Montana's hair has turned white, and he is now writing his memoirs, defending Fascism. When the Italian army invaded Albania, Montana commanded the Blackshirt divisions. Later, he commanded Fascist militias in Yugoslavia. Montana is at the top of Yugoslavia's list of wanted Italian war criminals. For a year, he has been living with his dark-haired wife and four-year-old daughter in a simple apartment outside a village on the Mediterranean coast. We walked down a narrow alley to reach his simple and unadorned residence, where Montana lives in hiding, constantly at risk of being arrested.</p>
<p>According to the guide, Montana is protected by powerful people, so he is safe. His friend Orlanta, another fugitive Fascist general, is also hiding in Italy. Montana met with the two reporters without appearing fearful or uneasy. When he was told that they would not reveal his location, he spoke freely with the reporters. Montana said that his memoirs would record Mussolini's good deeds, awaiting later generations to judge, and hoped that he could publish the book when he no longer needed to hide. Montana then recited a section of it, describing Mussolini's last situation in Milan, saying, "While I was negotiating surrender terms with representatives of the National Liberation Committee, Mussolini went to see the Archbishop of Milan, constantly raging and denouncing the National Liberation Committee as a gang of thieves, ordering me to stop the negotiations. I reported Mussolini's decision to the committee, and when I returned to headquarters, Mussolini had already left. A few hours later, Mussolini was captured by the party and executed in April 1945. If Mussolini had waited for me to go with him, I would probably not be alive today!"</p>
<p>After the end of the war, Montana evaded the eyes of the United Nations and Italian inspectors for a long time. On one occasion, he was interrogated by American intelligence officers in Rome for three days but was eventually released. Montana considers communism the greatest scourge of human civilization and has always believed in Fascism. Today, he is still alive in Italy. When asked about his feelings towards Mussolini, he said that Mussolini made too many mistakes, so he eventually lost faith in him. When asked about his opinion of Hitler, Montana shrugged dismissively and said, "He has been defeated."</p>
<h3>Byrnes Signs Treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 15th] The State Department announced today that Secretary of State Byrnes is scheduled to sign the treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary at the State Department on the 20th of this month. These treaties will be signed in Paris on February 10th, and the representative of the United States will be Ambassador to France Caffery.</p>
<h3>World Food Council Holds Third Executive Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 15th] The Central Executive Committee of the World Food Administrative Agency has announced that its third quarterly meeting will be held in Washington on the 30th of this month. The Secretary-General of the committee will report on the world food situation and the quantities of food to be allocated to food-deficient countries as decided by the previous meeting. Nineteen countries around the world will send representatives to attend.</p>
<h3>Koreans Oppose Trusteeship, Hold Large Demonstration Tomorrow, Demand Hodge Reject Soviet Proposals</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 15th] Korean representative to the United Nations, Rhee Louis, said today that Koreans are scheduled to hold a demonstration on Saturday to protest the four-power trusteeship of Korea, which will not be a violent riot. At that time, men and women from all sectors of agriculture, industry, and commerce will march in various cities in Korea, demanding that U.S. military commander General Hodge reject the Soviet proposal to only allow communist representatives of Koreans to participate in negotiations to end U.S.-Soviet military control. This is a collective expression of protest and will not be a violent riot. According to a Korean news representative, the scale of this demonstration may shock General Hodge. A year ago, Koreans held a similar demonstration, at which time the military mobilized and used tanks and machine guns to intimidate the demonstrators. Rhee has also sent a letter to U.S. senators, requesting that South Koreans be granted democratic autonomy before the unification of the northern and southern parts of Korea. He pointed out that although Koreans do not sympathize with communism, Koreans in the Soviet military zone in the north actually enjoy more autonomy, and their food supply is also better than that in the south.</p>
<h3>Amidst the Four Foreign Ministers' Representatives Meeting, the Soviets and Germans Suddenly Establish an Agreement: Show Goodwill to the Germans to Satisfy Their Desires, Which Will Affect the Future Moscow Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Berlin Radio, London, 16th: The Soviet authorities have announced that Sokolovsky, commander of the Soviet occupation forces in Germany, signed an agreement with leaders of the German Socialist Unity Party on January 11th, agreeing to stop dismantling German factory machinery in the Soviet occupation zone. Sokolovsky also promised to greatly reduce German reparations and completely exempt them from the supply of food, clothing, and fertilizer.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 15th] The "German Express," which is allowed to be published by the Soviet Union, stated today that Soviet officials are holding extremely important meetings with German political leaders to discuss fundamental plans concerning the future of Germany. The issue of reparations is the main topic of discussion. The Soviet military authorities are apparently prepared to make concessions to Germany's wishes, especially regarding the dismantling of German factories. Regarding the extraction of reparations from Germany's existing production, the Soviet Union will also give extensive consideration to all reasonable German wishes and then resolve them. The publication of this news by the newspaper at the time when the four foreign ministers' meeting in London is discussing the German-Austrian peace treaty is noteworthy. The location of the German-Soviet meeting has not been announced, but it is likely in Karlshorst, where the Soviet General Headquarters is located. The Socialist Unity Party, which is supported by the Soviet Union, did participate in the meeting. The newspaper stated that the concrete results of the discussion are expected to be produced within a few days. This meeting will enable Germany to obtain more substantial results, which cannot be compared with the Germans who recently went to London with only wishes in their hearts and unfortunately returned empty-handed. According to the Social Democratic Party leader Schumann, who recently went to England, the newspaper is referring to this person. The newspaper further stated that the current meeting is extremely important for two reasons: first, to allow Germany, at least the part of Germany in the Soviet occupation zone, to know the economic foundation for its recovery. Second, the moderate and coordinated policy adopted by the Soviet Union will inevitably affect the future Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, possibly leading other representatives at the Moscow Conference to adopt the same approach.</p>
<h3>Japanese Political Situation Increasingly Serious: Internal Disagreements Within the Socialist Party Regarding Participation in the Coalition Cabinet</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 16th] According to Japanese observers, the heavy pressure from leftist elements within the Social Democratic Party, the third largest party in Japan, will delay Prime Minister Yoshida's plan to resign from his cabinet and form a new coalition cabinet for several days. It is also said that Japanese labor groups are also opposed to the Social Democratic Party participating in a coalition cabinet dominated by reactionary elements, with Yoshida as the president of the Liberal Party and Minister of State Shidehara as the president of the Progressive Party, which hold an absolute majority in the Japanese Diet. At the same time, the right-wing elements of the Social Democratic Party support participating in the coalition cabinet. Due to the attitude of the labor groups, the right wing, which holds power in the Social Democratic Party, is adopting a policy of trying to persuade the leftist elements in order to avoid divisions within the party.</p>
<h3>Moutet Issues Statement on Vietnam: Viet Minh Army Stops Internal Strife</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 16th] French Overseas Territories Minister Moutet issued a statement last night stating: I recently went to Vietnam to inspect the situation on the ground and to seek a political basis for establishing or maintaining a Vietnamese Federation within the French Union. France is prepared to cooperate with people who strive for freedom and peace, but will never yield to violence.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Kunming, 15th] According to Viet Minh sources, the conflict between the Viet Minh army and the Viet Minh splinter groups, namely the National Army and the Allied Army, has completely stopped since the Hanoi French-Vietnamese conflict on December 19th. The strength of the National Army is estimated to be about 4,000, half of whom are irregular troops.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hanoi, 15th] According to a communiqué issued by the French military headquarters, French forces are continuing military operations in the Hanoi area, which are progressing smoothly. The Viet Minh army has suffered heavy losses, with 128 killed or wounded and 18 captured. In addition, French forces seized 20 firearms and occupied an ammunition depot. The Viet Minh troops trapped in the Annam Commercial Army attempted to break through but were repelled.</p>
<h3>Marshall Remains in Hawaii</h3>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco Radio, 16th: Marshall is still staying in Hawaii and has no firm date to go to Washington. He still spends his days fishing at sea and browsing through non-political books such as novels and legends.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, a freight train on the Beijing-Shanghai line derailed when it arrived at Nanxiang Station, causing the entire line to be interrupted for more than seven hours. It is reported that three damaged empty freight cars were being transported to the Qiqihar Car Factory for repairs. At 10:40 AM, when the train was near Nanxiang Station, 16 kilometers from Shanghai, the eighth car behind the locomotive, an empty car in disrepair with number 15CW, suddenly leaned south of the track. The ninth car, an empty car with number 20.OH.250225, was stuck in the track. The tenth car, an empty car with number 20CW270307, leaned north of the track. The eleventh car, an empty car with number 20CW270326, had its front wheels slightly off the track, and stopped at a location 16.7 kilometers from Shanghai. About one hundred and fifty sleepers were crushed, and the track was damaged, causing the train to stop. The stationmaster of Nanxiang Station, upon seeing this, immediately telegraphed the Railway Administration for assistance. Deputy Director and Chief of the General Affairs Office Hou Huohua, upon hearing the news, immediately led Deputy Chief Guan Duo, Wu Yukun, Transportation Chief Zhou Weidong, and engineers and employees from the Engineering Department, numbering dozens, to Nanxiang by rescue train. After strenuous repairs, traffic was restored at 6:00 PM. As a result, the special train for returning home on the Beijing-Shanghai line, which was newly opened at 10:30 AM yesterday, as well as train No. 8 at 11:00 AM, train No. 78 at 12:30 PM, train No. 1 at 1:30 PM, train No. 74 at 3:10 PM, and train No. 50 at 5:20 PM, all departed after 6:00 PM. Trains Nos. 75, 73, 51, 1, 5, 77, 7, 79, 71, and 3 from Nanjing to Shanghai were all waiting at Kunshan Station due to their inability to proceed, and arrived in Shanghai at 6:30 PM. According to Guan Duo, Deputy Chief of Transportation, the cause of the derailment was the fracture of the three damaged empty freight cars being transported to the Qiqihar Car Factory for repairs. Fortunately, it was a freight train and empty cars, so people and cargo were safe, and the direct damage was minor.</p>
<h3>City Government Revenue Suddenly Decreases Due to Unapproved Budget; Director Gu Jokingly Tells Reporters That He Will Not Retreat into Seclusion to Avoid Debt</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding the city government's budget for this year, the City Council discussed it repeatedly and finally considered the amount to be too large and did not approve it. Also, in order to reduce the burden on citizens, the City Council has reduced various taxes in the city, such as entertainment tax and banquet tax, in accordance with the newly established central tax law. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter visited Gu Chunfan, Director of the Finance Bureau, to inquire about how to deal with the decrease in city government revenue and the increase in expenditures. Director Gu was on the phone borrowing public funds to get through the year. He then smiled and told reporters: This year (lunar calendar) can be worry-free. As the Director of the Finance Bureau, I won't have to retreat into seclusion to avoid debt. Fortunately, the City Council has approved that the winter municipal construction donation can be collected as usual, so there is no major problem for the time being. The reporter then asked how to increase revenue next year. Director Gu replied: All avenues for increasing revenue have been rejected by the City Council, and the Finance Bureau has not been able to establish new tax items to increase the burden on citizens. Anyway, the City Council is temporarily adjourned and will be convened soon. I hope the Council can understand the city government's tight financial situation and approve the Finance Bureau's various proposals. According to reports, the 40 billion yuan for citizens' compulsory labor remuneration proposed by the Finance Bureau in this City Council meeting has been decided to be removed, and the tax rates for all other taxes have been reduced in accordance with the newly established tax law. Furthermore, whether to collect the municipal construction donation for the 36th year is still awaiting a final decision.</p>
<h3>Rural Areas Exempt from House Tax, Limited to Villages with Fewer Than 500 Households; Other Taxes and Levies May Also Be Appropriately Reduced or Exempted</h3>
<p>[Our Report] During the previous City Council meeting, a verbal request was made to exempt peddlers in rural areas from various taxes and levies, but this request was not approved because there was no such provision in the tax law. It is now heard that, in order to take care of small-scale operations and respect public opinion, the Finance Bureau has decided that, in all suburban areas, house taxes in villages with fewer than 500 households can be exempted in accordance with the new regulations. In addition to agricultural tax, the application for exemption from other taxes is under review, and it is heard that it must be completed within three months to benefit the common people.</p>
<h3>Proposals Related to the Budget: First Review the Actual Needs</h3>
<p>City Council Affairs: Will Resume After the Lunar New Year</p>
<p>The City Council Secretariat has collected all proposals related to the budget and is preparing to submit them to the Budget Group to review the actual needs before submitting them to the General Assembly for discussion. It is also heard that, due to other business, councilors do not intend to convene various committees again during the Lunar New Year. Therefore, except for internal work within the Secretariat, all Council affairs will resume after the Lunar New Year.</p>

<h3>Established Accelerated Delivery Methods for Mail to Foreign Residents in Beijing</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration recently received instructions from the Ministry of Communications Postal Administration, forwarded by the Minister, that postal delivery should be improved and accelerated. Especially, there must be improvements to the sorting and delivery of mail to foreign residents in Beijing. Accelerated delivery methods were thus established as follows: (1) The Postal Administration shall write to postal administrations in the UK, USA, France, and the Soviet Union, requesting them to directly seal all mail to Nanjing, China, so that the mail can be sent to Beijing for sorting and delivery upon arrival. (2) The delivery sections (i.e., the delivery post offices) for the residences of foreign residents in Beijing should be investigated and clarified by the Beijing Postal Administration, and a list of the delivery sections should be posted (and revised as needed) at the management office, all branch offices, the mobile post offices on the trains, and other conspicuous locations for the sorting of mail, so that it can be referred to when sorting the mail. Also, personnel should be assigned to consult with foreign residents in Beijing, requesting them to provide foreign senders with the delivery post office numbers for their residences on the envelopes or packages, such as Nangking (0) (indicating the Jiangsu Provincial Post Office in Nanjing), Nanking (1) (indicating the First Branch Post Office in Nanjing), etc., so that, once the mail from overseas arrives in Beijing and is opened, it can be sent directly to the relevant delivery post offices to avoid the delays caused by translating and inquiring about each item. (3) The Shanghai Postal Administration shall write to local newspaper offices, requesting them to indicate the delivery post office numbers on the envelopes of newspapers sent to foreign residents in Beijing, so that they can be sealed separately, increasing delivery speed. This method has already been widely implemented in this city. (4) The local factories and businesses in Shanghai should first deliver their mail to Beijing to the relevant Postal Administration branches before the 9 AM dispatch, so that they can catch the Shanghai-Nanjing train.</p>
<h3>Car Causes Accident and Flees; Uncle and Nephew Seriously Injured</h3>
<p>At around 9:30 AM yesterday morning on the north end of the Sichuan Road Bridge in this city, when it was raining continuously and there were many pedestrians, a black-plated private car with a Shanghai license plate suddenly sped past. At that moment, Liu Wenhao, who lives at No. 80 Lane, Xinzha Road, and his nephew Liu Zhaohan were riding in a rickshaw. The driver of the car, being careless, crashed into the rickshaw, causing it to overturn. Liu Wenhao and his nephew were both knocked to the side of the road, bleeding profusely. A nearby police officer saw the accident and arrived at the scene to investigate. The driver of the black-plated car, fearing punishment, sped away while the rickshaw puller pushed with full speed. The two injured men were then taken to the Suzhou River Public Hospital for treatment. After examination by the doctors, it was found that Liu Wenhao had suffered a head contusion and had a broken right finger, and Liu Zhaohan had a broken left arm. Their injuries were quite serious and life-threatening. As for the car that fled the scene, the police station in charge has sent officers to investigate.</p>
<p>Also, on Masnan Road at around 1:00 AM yesterday morning, a truck from the Zhongshan Automobile Company with license plate number 20907, in an attempt to avoid a large truck, crashed into a sycamore tree on the side of the road. The front of the truck, including the engine, was severely damaged. As of the afternoon, it was still parked on the side of the road.</p>
<h3>Postage Stamps Commemorating Chairman's Birthday: Second Set Sold Periodically</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration has decided to start selling the second set of commemorative postage stamps for Chairman Chiang's 60th birthday at the Philatelic Group of the Postal Administration starting on the 20th. The entire set consists of six stamps, which were printed by the Daye Printing Company. The paper is sturdy, the colors are beautiful, the perforations are five-eighths fewer than the first set, and the back of the stamp has glue, making it suitable for attaching to mail or collecting stamps. In addition, the new horizontal-format deficiency stamps from the Datong edition and the eleventh set of stamps overprinted with "National Currency" will also be sold at the same group starting on the same day.</p>
<h3>Low Pressure Envelops the City: Rain Persists Throughout the Day; Cloudy Skies Expected Today</h3>
<p>The weather in the city has been disturbed by a low-pressure system. Yesterday, it rained continuously all day, and the weather was terrible. By 6:00 PM, the rain had stopped because the low pressure had already passed Shanghai and reached a point in North Korea, 30 degrees north latitude and 121 degrees east longitude. The weather today is still expected to be cloudy. The high-pressure system is staying in Siberia and has not yet developed.</p>
<p>According to the weather report from the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory, a transformed Siberian anticyclone covers Japan. The center of the low-pressure system at 2:00 PM this afternoon was located at 30 degrees north latitude and 211 degrees east longitude, moving to the northeast or east-northeast. The large Siberian anticyclone in Lake Baikal is invading and shifting southeast in northwestern China, and will form a cold wave in China.</p>
<p>Weather forecast: Yellow Sea: cloudy, localized rain or snow, moderate easterly to northerly winds, huge waves. Central China: cloudy, rainy or foggy, fog in the evening, cold, moderate northeasterly to northwesterly winds.

<h3>More Than Nine Hundred Italian and Austrian Nationals Happily Brave the Rain to Board Ship to Return Home</h3>
<p>[Our Report] 952 Italian and Austrian nationals in this city, who are willing to return to their countries, have boarded the S.S. Marine Falcon at the China Merchants Bureau Wharf No. 1 yesterday afternoon, with the assistance of the UNRRA authorities, and will set sail for Naples, Italy, this morning.</p>
<p>Among the nationals returning to their countries, apart from the 91 Italian nationals who are not subsidized by the UNRRA, the remaining 762 Austrian nationals and 99 Italian and Greek nationals are being repatriated by the UNRRA. Most of them are Jewish refugees who fled to China under the persecution of Hitler. They have lived in Shanghai for seven or eight years, and many have had children here. Now, because their homelands have been restored, they are all willing to return home to reorganize their former businesses. Therefore, although it was windy and rainy at the China Merchants Bureau Wharf yesterday, these nationals who were about to leave Shanghai were all excited and not at all gloomy.</p>
<h3>Year-End Disputes Surge in the Party; Staff Joked About a Thorough Cleaning; Customers Unable to Enter; Yongan Director Receives a Bottle of Corrosive Liquid as a New Year's Gift; White Powder Slogans Smear the Windows; After "Worry Work," There's Now "Diligent Work"</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Labor disputes caused by year-end bonus issues have been surging recently and have not subsided. At the Yongan Company on Nanjing Road, also due to year-end bonus issues, the labor side suddenly launched a so-called "cleaning campaign" starting the day before yesterday, a unique twist on labor-management disputes. For days, staff have been covering the glass with red and green slogans, creating a dizzying effect. Simultaneously, staff printed and distributed leaflets to various sectors, expressing their grievances. The leaflet stated, in brief: "Regarding the demand for year-end bonuses, management has not only ignored it this year but also intends to renege on last year's bonuses." Therefore, the staff believe the campaign was launched out of being "forced" to do so. However, just as the "dispute" unfolded, unexpectedly, a visitor came to the residence of Yongan Company Director Song Changchao (No. 3, Lane 149, Jiaozhou Road) at around 10:30 a.m. yesterday, carrying two paper boxes, pretending to be delivering New Year's gifts. After knocking on the door and handing them over, the visitor immediately turned around and left. Later, upon opening the boxes, it was discovered that they contained a few oranges and a bottle of corrosive liquid. The motive was clearly intimidation. Song Changchao immediately reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. It is understood that Song is representing the management side in the current Yongan labor unrest.</p>
<p>Furthermore, following past practice, the National Goods Company used to give a 20% salary increase at the end of the year. However, this year, when the staff invoked the precedent, the management, citing poor business conditions, did not agree. Consequently, all employees began "action" yesterday, implementing a so-called "thorough cleaning" movement. This is similar to the Yongan Company's "cleaning campaign," albeit with a different approach. When customers arrived yesterday, the staff gathered in front of the main entrance, saying, "Please do not enter; there is a thorough cleaning going on inside." Simultaneously, the large glass windows along the street were covered in white powder, truly giving the impression of a thorough cleaning. In reality, the scene was quite similar to the "Empty City Stratagem" performed in Peking opera.</p>
<p>It is also reported that this "thorough cleaning" at the National Goods Company is also known as "diligent work." It is reminiscent of the "worry work" action at the Little Luzon Department Store the other day, a sign of ever-changing tactics. "Diligent work" differs from "worry work." "Worry work" involves staff displaying "worry" on their faces, not attending to customers, and appearing solely with a "mournful face." In contrast, "diligent work," on the surface, involves being eager to work, sweeping the doors and windows of the company, mopping the floors, and preventing customers from entering. When onlookers see this, they don't know whether to cry or laugh, like "a mute eating coptis," experiencing bitterness they cannot express.</p>
<h3>Bandit Leader from Nanhui Caught in Shanghai; Kidnapped a Baoshan Farmer Woman Imprisoned for More Than Sixty Days; Confessed That It Was Related to a Team Leader; The Team Leader Was Also Arrested</h3>
<p>According to a confidential report recently received by the Garrison Headquarters, a large group of bandits, approximately twenty in number, armed with light machine guns and various firearms, was operating in the Nanhui County area of Pudong, harassing and robbing civilians, committing all kinds of evil deeds. On November 3rd of last year, they kidnapped Shi Zhang Meiliang (52), a farmer woman living in Pan Shi Township, Shitousha. The Inspection Department dispatched the Pudong Inspection Office to investigate the case. After careful investigation by squad leader Yang Fulin, it was learned that the kidnapping was carried out by Lu A'er, a bandit leader hiding in Nanhui County. Shi's family had received a letter from the bandits, arranging</p>
<p>a meeting to negotiate the ransom.</p>
<p>Investigators disguised themselves as Shi's relatives, carrying the items specified by the bandits and heading to Sanzao, Donghai Township, Nanhui County, the designated</p>
<p>meeting place.</p>
<p>At the time, squad leader Yang, together with personnel from the Pudong Joint Defense Command and the Nanhui County Security Brigade, set up an ambush along the old Jianghai Beach, while inspector Huang Ding, disguised himself to negotiate the ransom conditions with the bandits. Huang arrived at the designated location, but the bandits were</p>
<p>extremely cunning.</p>
<p>They first searched Huang Ding and then took him to a small hut. The bandits posted guards outside to watch for any signs of trouble, while inside the hut, they negotiated the ransom procedures with Huang. The troops lying in ambush at that location could not</p>
<p>get close to the scene.</p>
<p>By the time they arrived, the bandits had already fled into the sea, so they gained nothing. The Inspection Department believed that this case would be difficult to handle with force and sent personnel to the township chief, instructing him to send a letter to the bandits,</p>
<p>appealing to their sense of righteousness</p>
<p>and ordering them to release Shi Zhang. On January 4th, Shi Zhang was released unconditionally by the bandits and returned home. According to Zhang's report on her kidnapping experience, she was kidnapped on November 3rd in Pan Shi Township, Shitousha, and taken by boat eastward to the sea near the area. On the 5th, she went ashore at Dushan after crossing three hills to a civilian's house in Jiulong Mountain. The same night, she returned to Dushan. On the morning of the 6th, she went to Jinshanwei, where she slept in the open for three days before being taken to a certain port. She was imprisoned in the bandit's den for more than sixty days before the bandits released her unconditionally, giving her 8,000 legal tender yuan</p>
<p>as travel expenses.</p>
<p>After Shi Zhang escaped, squad leader Yang Fulin continued to closely monitor the bandit's whereabouts. Later, he coincidentally encountered bandit leader Lu A'er near the Jiaotong Leather Shoe Store at Zhifu Road, Beijing Road, and secretly followed him. At the intersection of Xizang Road and Shantou Road, Lu was arrested. During interrogation, Lu admitted that he had kidnapped Shi Zhang, but it was carried out by his subordinate, Gu Xiaogen. Lu also implicated Chen Shan, the team leader of a certain regular brigade who was involved in the kidnapping. Later, inspection personnel arrested Chen Shan in a corner flat at the intersection of Xuejia Lane and Lujia Lane, Xiaonanmen, Nanshi. The case is currently under investigation.</p>
<h3>Former Shanghai Municipal Council's Retirement Pension for Chinese Employees; The Key Lies in the Multiplier Issue; If Calculated According to the Index, It Would Reach Over 60 Billion; Foreign Employees Are Not Included; Awaiting the Mayor's Final Decision</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] For over a year since the victory, former Chinese employees of the Shanghai Municipal Council have not received their savings, pensions, or severance pay. Since being unemployed, it has been difficult to maintain their livelihood. They have collectively petitioned the British consulate several times without result. The other day, Mayor Wu expressed his deep concern for their situation and resolved to instruct the Finance Bureau's Liquidation Committee to expedite the matter. Yesterday morning, Mayor Wu immediately summoned Gu Chunfan, the director of the Finance Bureau, to inquire about the progress of the Liquidation Committee and discuss repayment methods. This reporter visited Director Gu at 5 p.m. yesterday to inquire about the outcome of the meeting. Director Gu told this reporter that the Finance Bureau's Liquidation Committee is working according to the former Shanghai Municipal Council's regulations to calculate the amounts due to each employee. This is easy and can be completed in a few weeks. However, the key lies in the issue of the repayment multiplier, as the amounts calculated by the Liquidation Committee are very small, ranging from a few hundred yuan to larger amounts. Whether to issue the payments to former Chinese employees according to the cost-of-living index or multiply them by a corresponding factor is a matter for Mayor Wu to make the final decision on. The Finance Bureau has no power to decide. It is reported that there were approximately one thousand Chinese employees of the former Shanghai Municipal Council. According to related sources, the total amount of their savings, severance pay, and pensions is close to 100,000 yuan. Based on their position and length of service, the amounts vary greatly, with the smallest being only 100 or 200 yuan and the largest being about 500 or 600 yuan. If calculated according to a cost-of-living index of over 6,500 times, the amount the city government would have to repay would reach over 60 billion yuan. In the current situation of extreme economic difficulty, this is a major problem. Furthermore, this number does not include foreign employees. It is reported that there are approximately 500 or 600 foreign employees of the former Shanghai Municipal Council. Their positions and length of service vary, making the calculation extremely complicated. British employees are paid in pounds. It is said that there are senior employees who have served for two or three decades, and the total amount they are entitled to can reach tens of thousands of pounds. It is difficult to decide according to what ratio the city government will repay, as there is no precedent after the victory. Victory public bonds, for example, have not been repaid. It is also generally speculated that the central government is unlikely to provide subsidies, as all the assets of the Municipal Council were taken over by the local government, and its debts should also be repaid by the local government.</p>
<h3>The Xingzong Wanxiang Ship Privately Carrying Passengers and Cargo; The Entire Crew Involved in Corruption; Too Many People Involved, Difficult to Conclude the Trial Soon</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of the Xingzong Wanxiang ship illegally profiting from privately carrying passengers was retried in court yesterday. The defendants included Yang Weichen, Tai Jisheng, Lin Shixing, Han Xingcai, Yang Jishui, Yang Jingui, Jian Shijin, Tang Shengsong, Ku Yuda, Krick, and Jin Amao, a total of eleven people. It was found that Yang Weichen was an employee of Xingzong. In October of last year, while</p>
<p>transporting relief supplies to Tianjin and Qingdao, he took the opportunity</p>
<p>to carry 32 passengers, charging 120,000 yuan per person. Shipowner Krick was involved in the scheme, with Yang receiving one-third of the profits and Krick receiving two-thirds. Furthermore, sailor Yang</p>
<p>Jishui, through the introduction of the</p>
<p>Yiqi Travel Agency, colluded with crew members Lin</p>
<p>Shixing and Han Xingcai to privately carry 43 passengers, jointly earning 7,210,000 yuan from the passengers. Yang Jimu then offered 4,370,000 yuan to bribe the shipowner. At the same time, helmsman Yang Jingui, through his friend Yi Baojin, brought in 23 passengers, charging 250,000 yuan per person. After paying the ship 200,000 yuan per person, the remaining 50,000 yuan was split between Yang and Yi. In addition, Tang Shengsong introduced the loading of 700 bags of flour, charging 3,000 yuan per bag, and Jin Amao introduced the loading of 1,000 bags of rice, charging 15,000 yuan per bag. Two-thirds of this went to the shipowner, and one-third was equally divided among the entire crew. Moreover, the cook Jian</p>
<p>was reported to the waterway police branch, which arrested the entire crew and the over 130 passengers, transferring them to the District Prosecutor's Office. The prosecutor, considering that from the shipowner to the crew, everyone on the</p>
<p>ship was corrupt and extremely unlawful, prosecuted them under Article 3, Section 6 of the Anti-Corruption Regulations. Although the defendants admitted to privately carrying passengers in court yesterday, too many people were involved, making it difficult to conclude the trial soon. The court adjourned the trial for a later date.</p>
<h3>The Greater Shanghai Evening News Workers Strike; Management Reports to the Municipal Authorities; No Agreement Reached, Preparing to Apply for Mediation</h3>
<p>The city's English-language Greater Shanghai Evening News did not publish yesterday due to a sudden strike by printing workers. According to news released by the newspaper's party bureau: The strike occurred after the issuance of a one-month New Year's bonus and the first half of this month's salary. The workers did not apply for a strike in advance, demanding a week off during the period, or double pay if they did not take a week off, as well as a loan of 300,000 yuan per person. The newspaper's president, Gaul Tsungch'un, issued a statement to the workers, stating in brief: "The municipal authorities have informed this newspaper that there are no official holidays during the Lunar New Year period, so this newspaper has decided to only take one day off on Lunar New Year's Day. Regarding the New Year's bonus issue, this newspaper has already issued one month's double salary and cannot issue any other special subsidies or loans. As for this strike incident, this newspaper intends to apply to the municipal authorities for strict handling and is prepared, if necessary, to close the factory and reorganize with the consent of the municipal authorities." The workers suspended work twice yesterday but resumed work shortly after. After learning that the management had no intention of making concessions, they formally went on strike. The newspaper's management has reported the situation to the municipal authorities and is preparing to apply for mediation if direct negotiations cannot be quickly established.</p>
<h3>Joint Celebration by Shanghai Garrison and Police Scheduled to Be Held at Yiyuan Garden</h3>
<p>The army, navy, air force stationed in Shanghai, and the Shanghai Municipal Police are planning to hold a Spring Festival celebration at Yiyuan Garden on Albert Road on the 23rd of this month to connect emotionally and exchange knowledge, as the Spring Festival is approaching. In addition to inviting party and government officials, social dignitaries, and distinguished ladies to dine together, there will be entertainment programs such as dancing,</p>
<p>singing, and movies to entertain the guests. The event is bound to be lively.</p>
<h3>Adjustment of Pawnshop Interest Rates</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council had suggested to the Municipal Government to add public pawnshops and adjust the interest rates of paste-on vouchers or public pawnshops. Yesterday, the Municipal Government's reply was received, and the Social Affairs Committee made its fifth decision, which was to set the period for six months. If there are difficulties in turnover, the Municipal Bank should adjust it. The handling fee for each pawn of 15 cents has been ordered to be changed to seven cents, and the interest rate of 27 cents has been changed to 20 cents, which will be notified by the Social Affairs Bureau for implementation soon.</p>
<h3>One Year of Public Land Survey; Recently Concluded; A Total Area of 6,764 Mu Received; Registration Is Currently Being Processed to Complete Legal Procedures</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] During the current Municipal Council meeting, someone questioned the Land Administration Bureau about the handling of the city's public property and requested that all public land be leased to citizens at a low price to solve part of the housing shortage problem. This reporter inquired with Yang, the secretary of the Land Administration Bureau, about the public land survey. The following is what Yang reported: The public land survey has been going on for a year now. At the beginning of the implementation, the archives of the public property in the old two concession areas were incomplete, and the land registration in each district was extremely chaotic, creating many difficulties. It was not until recently that it came to an end. It has now been determined that there are 1,249 parcels of public land in the 18 districts that the city has received, reaching over 2,100 mu. The public registration of the above public land is currently being processed to complete the legal procedures.</p>
<p>Enemy and Puppet Sales of Public Land</p>
<p>Regarding the enemy and puppet's disposal of public land, it has been verified that during the period when the enemy controlled the Bureau of Works, from December 8, 1941, to the end of July 1943, the enemy disposed of and sold 97 parcels of public land, totaling 158 mu, 8 fen, and 7 li. The puppet government sold 137 mu, 9 fen, and 4 li of public land from August 1, 1943, when it "took over" the two concession areas, to August 1945, when the War of Resistance was won.</p>
<p>Vichy Government Period</p>
<p>During the Vichy government period, the former French Municipal Council sold public land. From February 23, 1943, when the French government announced the abandonment of its special rights in China, to May 19, 1943, when the national government announced the cancellation of French privileges in China, to August 1, 1943, when the French Concession was handed over to the puppet government, a total of 27 parcels, totaling 56 mu, 2 fen, and 3 li and 9 hao were sold. The French Municipal Council did not transfer 48 parcels of public land, totaling 323 mu, 3 fen, and 5 li and 4 hao.</p>
<p>Puppet Government's Disposal Deemed Invalid</p>
<p>Regarding the handling of the above public land, according to Article 3 of the "Measures for Clearing Land Rights in Recovered Areas" promulgated by the Executive Yuan, the puppet government's disposal of public land is deemed invalid. Except for public land that has been released for agricultural land and the contract holder is a self-employed farmer</p>
<p>cultivating the land, according to Article 4, the contract holder may be required to complete the contract procedures again within a limited time and without payment. The rest should be publicly announced and taken back by the Party and Government.</p>
<p>Regarding the validity of the disposal of public land during the enemy-occupied Municipal Council period, after</p>
<p>receiving instructions from the Executive Yuan: "During the</p>
<p>Government's</p>
<p>occupation of the Public Concession, the enemy's</p>
<p>occupation</p>
<p>has</p>
<p>been</p>

<p>Concealing Public Land, Rewarding Reports</p>
<p>The above is a general overview of the Bureau's work in surveying public land over the past year. In the future, we still hope that citizens will report concealed public land. The reporter can report to the Bureau in writing with a brief map of the location and boundaries of the public land, the name and address of the encroacher, and the history and usage of the public land. The Bureau is currently planning to reward reports of concealed</p>
<p>public land and has submitted the plan to the Municipal Government. The plan stipulates that if a school is found to have concealed public land, it will be given a bonus of 20% of the land's value.</p>
<h3>It is Easier to Change Mountains and Rivers Than a Person's Nature; Released in Two General Amnesties, Yet Commits Robbery Again</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At 11:30 a.m. yesterday, Chief Shi of the Laoza Branch personally led officers and soldiers, patrolling the territory in a jeep, and searching suspicious pedestrians. When they reached the entrance of the Natural Hotel on Zhifu Road, they noticed a Western-dressed man acting suspiciously. Chief Shi ordered the officers to</p>
<p>get out of the car to search him, but the man suddenly turned and fled. The officers immediately pursued him and eventually managed to arrest him with a gun. A Mauser pistol and eight rounds of ammunition were found in his possession. He was taken to the station for questioning. It is reported that the man is indeed a notorious robber. Twenty years ago, he committed a robbery and murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. He was released in a general amnesty, which reduced his sentence to fourteen years. Recently, he was released again in another general amnesty, and only a few days later, he committed another robbery.</p>
<h3>Strange Car on the Roadside; License Plate Found to Be Forged; Evading Inspection, Speeds Away; Police Officer Opens Fire, Accidentally Injuring a Pedestrian</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At approximately 8:10 p.m. yesterday, a patrol team of the Jing'an Temple Branch spotted a black-plated car parked on the side of the road between Fuhuangdu Road and Jiaozhou Road, with the license plate number 17578. As they were about to approach for inspection, the driver disobeyed orders and immediately started the engine, speeding away. At that time, the officers gave chase, firing three shots in a row. The car escaped without a trace. The stray bullet wounded a pedestrian, Wang Xiaotang (26 years old, from Huangyan, a coppersmith), in the right shoulder. Fortunately, it was only a skin wound, and the bullet fell with his coat. He was taken to the Civilian Hospital for treatment by passersby. The branch reported the incident to the General Bureau. After investigation by Section Chief Lu Xia of the Vehicle Section, it was learned that the car was owned by Guo Qiong, the factory director of the Yongan Textile Factory (resident of No. 12, Lane 479, Beijing Road). Guo Qiong was ordered to report to the bureau. He claimed that the car was still at home and had not been out, so the license plate must be forged. The branch is currently continuing its investigation.</p>

<p>National Art Professor Zhang Liangshan's exhibition of more than 200 watercolor and ink paintings will be held at the Daxin Company Gallery starting on the 20th.</p>
<h3>Storytelling and Ballads</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Among Shanghai's entertainment options, listening to storytelling is relatively quiet. The gongs and drums in the theater are unavoidably deafening, and watching movies may cause eyestrain. Therefore, a group of quiet people go to the storytelling venue to spend their time, sipping tea while listening to the story, which has a unique flavor. Moreover, the seat prices are not expensive. A thousand yuan for tea allows one to sit for two or three hours, making it the most economical option.</p>
<p>Storytelling is divided into Pinghua (評話) and Tanci (彈詞), commonly known as "big stories" and "small stories." Pinghua is based on the rise and fall of dynasties and the success or failure of battles. They are mostly stories of heroes and righteous men. It is all oral storytelling, and the narrator must perform all kinds of roles, from the main character to the clown, with both form and spirit to be considered excellent. Tanci uses the Sanxian (三弦) and Pipa (琵琶) to accompany the narration, and sings and portrays the romantic stories of talented scholars and beautiful women in vivid detail, which can also be captivating.</p>
<p>Suzhou is the main base for storytelling. Most of those engaged in this profession are Wu people. Their industry organization, called the "Guangyu Society (光裕社)," has a long history. Later, the Zhejiang faction created the "Runyu Society (潤裕社)," to compete with the Guangyu Society, but because people generally prefer to listen to the soft language of Wu, its power ultimately could not match that of the Guangyu Society. In the past, most storytellers were men. The term "female storyteller (女說書)" mostly referred to famous courtesans who entertained guests. The beautiful voice of a woman is naturally moving and most suitable for singing, so female storytelling also became an organization, called the Puyu Society (普餘社), forming a three-way balance with Guangyu and Runyu. Sometimes, men and women partnered, or husband and wife sang together, or father and daughter performed together, which was quite popular. It was not until the establishment of the Pinghua and Tanci Research Association that the boundaries between the three were broken.</p>
<p>Storytelling is popular in the Jiangnan (江南) and West Zhejiang (浙西) areas. Whether in cities or towns, they can be found, but due to language barriers, they cannot gain a foothold north of Changzhou on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, or south of Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province. In Shanghai, it was only a novelty in amusement parks in the past. Although there were a few teahouse-style storytelling venues, the audience was mostly small citizens. Since the rise of radio broadcasting, storytellers have become popular, because Tanci is most suitable for broadcasting. The sound of the stringed instruments can be heard everywhere and at any time.</p>
<p>Storytelling relies on radio broadcasting, attracting many distinguished people, which in turn motivated those with a good business sense to set up new-style storytelling venues. Places like Nanjing and Dongfang are crowded with people. Although storytelling is primarily based on listening, radio is ultimately not as vivid as live performance with singing and instrumental accompaniment in portraying the characters in the story, so radio broadcasting does not affect the business of storytelling venues. After the War of Resistance, radio broadcasting declined for a time, and the storytelling venues became even more crowded. The storytelling venues that had previously closed down reopened one after another, and many new ones were also established. There are now more than 20 storytelling venues in the city, among which the Huiquan Building on Shilu Road has the longest history, spanning six or seven decades. The Cangzhou Storytelling Venue on Chengdu Road has a spacious venue and comfortable seating, making it the most luxurious in terms of equipment. Among the various forms of entertainment with local characteristics, storytelling can also attract many patrons.</p>
<p>Southern people like Tanci, while northern people prefer Dagu (大鼓, a type of ballad). There are many kinds of Dagu, such as Beijing-style Dagu, Pear Blossom Dagu, Eight-Cornered Fast Talk (八角快書), and so on. In Shanghai, there are only occasional opportunities for them to rise to prominence, but they cannot last. In the past, they were only attached to amusement parks as</p>
<p>minor attractions and did not have independent venues. At that time, there were two places for Dagu, one was in the New World (新世界), where drum kings like Liu Baoquan (劉寶全), Little Black Girl (小黑姑娘), and Zhang Shaoxuan (張少軒) sang, and the other was in the Great World (大世界), where Xue Dawang (薛大王), Old Dwarf Gourd (老矮瓜), and Little Jiuling (小九齡) performed.</p>
<p>In 1932, Huang Chujiu (黃楚玖) changed the site of his clothing store to a Beijing-style storytelling venue, which was the first time northern Dagu was performed independently in Shanghai. At that time, in addition to the main performers Bai Yunpeng (白雲鵬) and Little Black Girl, there were also Eight-Cornered Fast Talker He Zhichen (何質臣), Yueqin player Yang</p>
<p>Qin (楊</p>
<p>琴), and comedian Dagu player Shanyao Dan (山藥旦), which was a very neat lineup, and the attendance was not bad. Unfortunately, it only lasted for two months. Later, drum stories were also performed at the Tianchan Teahouse near the racecourse on 4th</p>
<p>Road and downstairs at the Greater China Hotel. Especially when drum king Liu Baoquan came to Shanghai to perform several times, it was a</p>
<p>sensation for a while.</p>
<p>Liu Baoquan's achievements in the art of Dagu can be said to be unprecedented. His voice was a natural gift, high-pitched, clear, and mellow, and coupled with his</p>
<p>expressions and movements, the audience was filled with vigor. Listening to his performance of "Ningwuguan (寧武關)" was exciting and maintained, singing "The Great Western Chamber (大西廂)" was graceful, romantic, and extremely meticulous, with language and actions both vivid and lifelike. Moreover, he was very strict with himself, abstaining from smoking, gambling, alcohol, and</p>
<p>sex, so when he came to the south for the last time in 1939, although he was already 71 years old, his spirit was still</p>
<p>vibrant and his voice was still loud. Except for the</p>
<p>patch of white, bald hair on the back of his head, he did not look like an old man over seventy years old.</p>

<h3>Heaven Favors Us: Dense Fog Arrives Late, First French Aircraft Safely Lands in Shanghai, Here for Inspection to Open the Sino-French Air Route</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Air France has specially dispatched a plane E-BBDE from Paris for a test flight and inspection to open a Sino-French air route. The plane departed Saigon at 6:30 AM yesterday and safely arrived at Jiangwan Airport in Shanghai at 2:30 PM amidst light rain. It is the first French aircraft to arrive in China after the war. The plane is a DC-4 four-engine giant, with a silver-white fuselage, painted with blue stripes and a Pegasus logo, which is quite beautiful. The cabin has 44 leather seats. Yesterday, it carried 11 company commissioners and 7 people including pilots, co-pilots, radio operators, and attendants. French officials and shipping companies from the city sent personnel to the airport to welcome them, and many young ladies presented flowers to express their gratitude. The atmosphere was filled with laughter, and the arrival was smooth. Shortly after landing, the city was shrouded in dense fog. The plane is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 19th of this month, fly to Saigon, and return to France. As for the official opening date, it is still pending a decision from the Paris headquarters. The above picture shows the French plane arriving in Shanghai. The picture below: is the flight attendant. (Photo by our reporter)</p>
<h3>Heavy Fog Envelops Capital Airport, Three Aircraft Land Safely One After Another, Zhou Zhirou Congratulates Pilots at the Scene</h3>
<p>[United Press Nanjing, 16th] Two China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) planes (carrying a total of 22 passengers) and a US Army C-54 transport plane (one of its four engines already damaged) landed safely one after another within half an hour at Nanjing Airport, which was enveloped in heavy fog on the morning of the 16th. Air Force Commander Zhou Zhirou and Brigadier General McNair, head of the aviation group of the US Military Advisory Group, were both at the airport observing the cooperation between the ground control tower and the crew members on the Army transport plane, enabling the safe landing of this giant plane which was already damaged, on the runway.</p>
<p>At that time, the fog was very dense, and the runway was almost indistinguishable from the airport management office. One minute after the transport plane landed, CNAC C-47 No. 50 transport plane, carrying 11 passengers from Shanghai to Hankou, also emerged from the thick fog and landed at the airport. Twenty minutes later, CNAC Shanghai-Beiping flight C-47 No. 54 transport plane, carrying 11 passengers from Shanghai, intending to go to Beiping via Nanjing and Qingdao, also landed on the runway in adverse weather conditions. Although the weather was gradually deteriorating, the pilot still kept the plane in the air, waiting for the Army plane to land first, to avoid a mid-air collision. The Army plane, piloted by Lieutenant Owens, was carrying supplies from Shanghai to Chengdu to supply the US military graves registration team in West China when one engine was damaged. Because it was far from Jiangwan Airport, it was forced to land at Nanjing Airport. Both CNAC planes were piloted by Chinese crew members and are currently staying in Nanjing, waiting for the weather to clear. Zhou inspected both planes and congratulated the pilots for their high skill in flying in such dangerous weather, and discussed why they took off in such adverse weather conditions. The two planes were originally scheduled to land at Ming Palace Airport, but due to low visibility, they switched to landing at the military airport.</p>
<h3>Notice to All Areas: Suspension of Flights to Shanghai</h3>
<p>(Another dispatch) Due to the adverse weather conditions, which were unfavorable for flying, China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation immediately telegraphed all areas to suspend flights to Shanghai for safety reasons. However, the flights from Shanghai to various areas yesterday were still normal because the weather was still good in the morning.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Taiwan Flights Resume, Cheng Shih-kuei and Others Return to Nanjing and Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 16th] China National Aviation Corporation Shanghai-Taiwan and Fujian-Taiwan flights have resumed today. Cheng Shih-kuei and two other members of the Ministry of Education's Taiwan Education Inspection Group, who arrived in Taiwan on November 28th last year to inspect education throughout the province, left Taiwan today to return to Nanjing. Wu Chin-hang and six other National Assembly representatives from Sichuan Province and Director Xu of the Tianjin Haihe Engineering Bureau also returned to Shanghai on the same flight.</p>
<h3>Further News on the Miss Sung Case: Miss Zhu Calls, Says Company Was Careless</h3>
<p>Zhu Qiao-xian, the "campus belle" of St. John's University, took the "Miss Luzon" plane to Hong Kong to transfer to the United States for further studies. Unexpectedly, she was almost killed in the accident and suffered minor injuries to her leg. Fortunately, she survived. Miss Zhu has now called Shanghai to report her safety. However, she mentioned that all the victims of the accident were Chinese, while all the foreigners were safe and sound, which aroused suspicion. She also learned that the plane's engine had a problem, and the company authorities knew about it in advance, but after repairs, they still flew carelessly because they thought it was not serious, which ultimately led to the disaster.</p>
<h3>Settlement Measures Set for Soldiers and Officers Repatriated from Australia</h3>
<p>The first batch of 339 soldiers and officers who were captured by the Japanese army and sent overseas and are now being repatriated from Abau Island, Australia, completed the survey forms issued by the First Supply Zone Command under the order of the Ministry of National Defense last week. It is now learned that the Ministry of National Defense has formulated the following measures for their resettlement: (1) The United Logistics Command will prepare accommodation in Shanghai and take care of them properly, and will first issue a consolation fee of 100,000 yuan to each officer and 50,000 yuan to each soldier. (2) The United Logistics Command will issue winter clothing, shoes, and socks to officers and soldiers who lack them. (3) Officers and soldiers who are disabled or injured and need treatment will be sent by the United Logistics Command to veterans' homes and army hospitals for treatment. (4) Officers with excellent qualifications and strong physique who volunteer to continue serving will be given training or reassigned. (5) Soldiers who are still fit for service will be transferred to the conscription bureau as reserve soldiers. (6) Officers and soldiers who have reached retirement age and are unable (or unwilling) to serve will be allowed to retire in accordance with the current retirement procedures, and soldiers will be given severance pay and travel expenses to return to their hometowns. Those who have no home to return to will be transferred to various factories and farms in the interior to take on idle work.</p>
<h3>Zhao Zunyue to Be Tried Today</h3>

<h3>Two Years in Prison for Extortion, Now in Court Again for Collaborating with the Enemy</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Zhou En-yuan, a former lieutenant adjutant of the Provisional Brigade under the puppet Shanghai Security Command, detained a salt transport ship of the puppet China Salt Industry Company during the enemy's occupation and extorted 140 dan of salt without success. Later, he exchanged 17 dan of salt for 2 dou of rice. After the case was discovered, the puppet Security Command sentenced him to two years in prison, which was served in the Sinan Road Detention Center. After the victory, the High Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution against Zhou for treason because he had held a puppet position. He was tried in the High Court yesterday. The defendant argued that the salt ship was detained by Huang Jie, the puppet Security Brigade Commander, and that he himself was arrested by the puppet Security Command because of his association with Xu Ya-zhong, the captain of the Loyal Salvation Army. He only served as a puppet lieutenant adjutant for three months, and has already been imprisoned for two full years, requesting bail. The court ruled that bail was not allowed and ordered a postponement of the hearing for further questioning of witnesses.</p>
<h3>Xin Zhuang Youth Hu Gan-ren Accused of Being an Enemy Secret Agent</h3>

The defendant is 23 years old, small in stature, with a pale complexion, wearing a tweed overcoat, and his answers were quite sharp. He claimed that the accuser, Xiang Chang-yan, was from Xin Zhuang Town and had a long-standing feud with him. Xiang had also served as the chairman of the puppet maintenance association. Hu also denied that he had accompanied the enemy's gendarmerie and puppet army to arrest the accuser, and claimed that he was still young at that time, still a child, how could he be a secret agent. The court ordered a postponement of the hearing for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Villagers Catch Corpse While Fishing, Remains of Zhu Xiang-ming, Passenger Who Died on Christmas Eve, Located, Delivered to Central Airlines for Reburial</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] On Christmas Eve last year, Central Air Transport Corporation flight No. 48 crashed in Jiangwan, among the passengers was Zhu Xiang-ming (Army New 74th Division 58th Brigade Logistics Director), only a section of his thigh was found afterwards. Although the company sent personnel to search the crash site, Zhu's body was not found. Therefore, when he was placed in the coffin, only a thigh was used as his body. Unexpectedly, half a month later, a villager named Wang from Zhangjiazhai caught a fish in the Beihe River near the crash site. He was overjoyed to find a big fish in the net and hurriedly pulled the net out of the water. To his horror, he saw a corpse with a blurred face and missing limbs. He was horrified and abandoned the net to report to Li Xiang-zhou, the head of the 11th bao in the area. Li immediately went to investigate with the villagers and lifted the fishing net to the shore again. After careful inspection, although the corpse's face had rotted, the clothing was still there, including a flannel shirt and pants, a grass-green jumpsuit, and only one foot with a yellow leather shoe. This was generally consistent with the body sought by Central Air Transport Corporation. Therefore, he reported the information to the Yin-hang police station of the competent police sub-bureau, which telegraphed Central Air Transport Corporation. The company sent two staff members, Xu Yao-dong and Yang Zan-chen, to accompany the prosecutor from the district prosecutor's office to conduct an examination. The result confirmed that it was Zhu Xiang-ming's corpse. Therefore, the Central Air Transport Corporation was given the corpse for reburial.</p>
<h3>Valuable Fur Goods Belonging to Five Traitors, Auction Date May Be Postponed</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Enemy-Puppet Property Clearance Office recently decided to auction off the fur goods of traitors. It is learned that this batch of fur goods belonged to Zhou Fo-hai, Sheng You-tan, Qian Da-jun, Jiji Qu (wife of Li Shi-qun), and She Ai-zhen (wife of Wu Shi-bao). The property group believes that such valuable fur goods are not necessities of life, and under no circumstances should they be returned. Long-term storage will inevitably lead to insect damage, so they will be auctioned off and the proceeds will be turned over to the national treasury. There are a total of 229 pieces of fur goods, divided into 25 groups, with 7 to 8 pieces or more than 10 pieces in each group. The bottom price for each group ranges from 7-8 million yuan to 8-9 million yuan. There are valuable silver fox, mink, otter skins, and a tiger skin. They are divided into fur robes, coats, and cheongsams.</p>
<p>The auction date was originally set for the 26th of this month, but because that day is the fifth day of the first lunar month, it may be postponed to the 28th. The viewing dates are from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on the 19th and from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 20th at the China Bank Building, 8th floor, The Bund.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>(1) Taking a Concubine to Continue the Lineage</p>
<p>Tang Mo-yun asks: I am middle-aged and have no children. In the 32nd year of the Republic, I married a woman named Zhu as a concubine. The following year, she gave birth to a son, who unfortunately died last spring. Since then, her attitude has changed drastically. Initially, she claimed that she and my wife were not getting along, and she has been living in her mother's home for a long time and has not returned since. She does not reply to my letters. I ask: Given the above situation, is her leaving without returning illegal? After she leaves, do I still have to bear her living expenses? If I have no choice, can I file a lawsuit?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Ya-kui answers] Legally, there is no status of a concubine, only a cohabitation relationship. You should try to persuade her to return. If the woman surnamed Zhu is still unwilling to come back, you are not responsible for her living expenses, but you also cannot apply for compensation for any losses.</p>
<p>(2) Cleverly Enticing Cohabitation</p>
<p>Wu Jun-de asks: Mr. A is now 48 years old and has a wife and three sons. At the age of 36, he met an 18-year-old girl, B. B's parents died early, and she was raised to adulthood by her foster mother. At that time, Mr. A, seeing that B was intelligent and beautiful, used various means to collude with B's foster mother to induce her into cohabitation. This has been going on for twelve years. Later, as B grew older, she realized she had been deceived, but she could not escape Mr. A's control. Now there are several legal questions, please answer them: (1) Is Mr. A's cohabitation with Miss B legal? If Miss B insists on breaking off the cohabitation relationship but is rejected, what means should she use to deal with it? (2) If Miss B does not seek Mr. A's consent and elopes to marry another man, is it legal? (3) If Miss B elopes alone but is still monitored by Mr. A, can she sue him for obstructing her freedom of movement? (4) If Mr. A refuses to allow her to leave and hires a lawyer to provide legal protection, is it valid? (5) If Miss B elopes privately, can Mr. A sue her for elopement and file a lawsuit?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Ya-kui answers] (1) The cohabitation relationship is not legal. If Miss B insists on breaking off the relationship but is rejected, she can request a court ruling. (2) Yes, but when eloping, she may not take any items other than her own. (3) Yes. (4) It should be judged according to the actual situation. (5) If she did not take any items other than her own, then of course no crime can be established.</p>

<h3>To Facilitate the Collection and Settlement of Public and Private Funds, the Central Bank Issues New Customs Gold Notes in Denominations of 250 Yuan and 500 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] In order to gradually recover the flat-printed notes issued during the war and to facilitate the collection and settlement of public and private funds, the Central Bank has begun to issue new versions of customs gold notes in denominations of 250 yuan and 500 yuan. These banknotes are printed with excellent quality and are forgery-proof. However, it is understood that there are not many currently available. If people find them convenient to use, they can contact the bank for exchange.</p>
<p>In addition, a person in charge of the bank gave a speech regarding the issuance of the new version of customs gold notes, stating that during the war, due to the crude printing equipment and the difficulty in importing banknote materials, the banknotes printed were not of good quality. Now that these difficulties have been eliminated, the bank is determined to make the banknote printing as exquisite as possible, and the banknote varieties will be gradually reduced in order to gradually unify the circulating banknotes. The purpose of issuing two new versions of customs gold notes this time is to gradually recover the old notes and facilitate the collection and settlement of funds, in order to meet the hopes of society.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The Ministry of Finance has recently stipulated and announced measures to restrict the carrying of national currency abroad, and reaffirmed the prohibition of gold and silver exports and foreign currency imports. The Ministry of Finance, in view of the fact that Chinese citizens often carry huge amounts of national currency, gold, silver, or foreign currency notes to Hong Kong or other areas outside the country, which hinders import and export and foreign exchange management, has specially stipulated measures to restrict the carrying of national currency abroad by passengers, and reaffirmed the prohibition of preventing the smuggling and carrying of gold and silver exports and foreign currency imports and exports, and notified the customs to strictly implement them.

If the amount carried exceeds the regulations, all excess amounts shall be confiscated; (2) According to the regulations on preventing the smuggling and carrying of gold and silver exports, all gold and silver are not allowed to be smuggled out of the country. Those who must transport them out of the country for legitimate reasons shall first apply to the Ministry of Finance for a permit and transport them with the permit. Those who violate the regulations will have all their goods confiscated and turned over to the public treasury. Passengers exporting gold or silver cultural or commemorative items, or ancient coins or rare coins, etc., shall first declare them to the customs. The customs will assess the value and allow the passengers to pay a deposit to release the goods. Within one year, if the original goods are still imported, the deposit will be refunded. If the deadline is exceeded, the deposit will be confiscated and turned over to the public treasury. Those who export with a transit passport, or have purchased ship, train, or airplane tickets, or hold other legal documents that prove that they are detouring to the interior, if they carry gold or silver products, regardless of their nature or type, shall pay a deposit according to the above regulations. After arriving at their destination, they can invite a guarantor to prove that the original goods have not been exported, and apply to the original deposit-collecting agency to refund the deposit. Those who fail to declare within one year will be confiscated and turned over to the public treasury. Passengers who export or detour to the interior and carry gold and silver without declaring them and paying a deposit shall have all the items carried confiscated and turned over to the public treasury; (3) According to the Provisional Measures for Foreign Exchange Control of the Central Bank, passengers may carry up to US$200 or other foreign currency notes of equivalent value for import and export.

<p>[Our Report] With the Lunar New Year approaching, regarding the fluctuation of general commodity prices in this city, our reporter specially visited Mr. Shao Jihua, the section chief of the Price Management Department of the Social Affairs Bureau.

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The rules for managing customs brokerages, stipulated by the Ministry of Finance, have been promulgated and implemented. A customs brokerage specifically refers to an individual, firm, or company located in a customs office or its branch, specializing in handling customs declaration and tax payment matters on behalf of others. To operate such a business, it is necessary to first prepare an application and apply to the local customs office or its branch for a customs brokerage business license. However, a cash deposit of 200,000 to 4 million national currency, or an equivalent amount of other bonds, or a guarantee from a local legal customs brokerage association must be provided.</p>

<h3>Chaotic Coal Market Pricing</h3>
<p>The coal market is experiencing weak trading due to the end of the year, leading to extremely chaotic pricing. The same goods are being traded simultaneously with differences of twenty to thirty thousand dollars. Kailan No. 2 fine coal is being dumped by large dealers, and market prices have retreated after rising. Firewood charcoal prices have fallen back to low levels, and trading remains stagnant. Hongji lump white coal is still selling at $960,000, and Yangquan lump coal is at $900,000 to $923,000, with some transactions. Arrivals of Jiaozuo coal continue to be scarce, and the market situation is quite mobile.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Firm and Steady</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market was initially depressed yesterday because the appraised prices and the supply prices of the Textile Construction Company both increased. The Textile Construction Company's quotations for fine cloth 3A, Caiqiu, Yanghe, and Lanfeng were all $1,020,000. Due to smooth sales, the market situation was only slightly lower than the previous day. Only the stock of dark blue Shilin cloth was sufficient, so the market remained firm. The prices of other qualities remained stable and firm.</p>
<h3>Year-End Trade Slack; Chinese Stocks Decline More Than Rise</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were even more sparsely traded yesterday. New buying was not sustained, and many existing holdings such as numbers 212 and 97 were sold. A major investor, Mr. Wang, continued to sell off his holdings outside the market until he was exhausted. There was still some activity in the afternoon. Trading opened slightly higher in the morning, but after opening, although numbers 112 and 83 were sold slightly lower, numbers 219, 22, and 152 advanced, and delayed delivery rose to $791, and current delivery rose to $782. Numbers 180, 224, 97, 91, 4, 125, 89, 83, 85, and 156 were continuously sold, gradually declining, and spot prices fell to $755, and forward delivery fell to $760. Numbers 14 and 156 and 91 were replenished, pulling the price up by ten dollars. Business shares were sold from number 198 to the limit down, and numbers 97, 30, 89, 78, 212, and 233 were all sold. Numbers 183, 35, and 160 were sold for current delivery, and at noon, prices fell to a low of $737 for current delivery and $748 for delayed delivery. Numbers 218 and 47 took advantage of the low prices to buy, and the market stabilized slightly at the noon close. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yongsha, Xinguang, and Qinxing fell by less than half a percent, Meiya fell slightly, Huafeng was flat, and Xinnuo and Jingfu each fell by slightly more than half a percent. Unpopular business shares had fallen to the limit down. The rest were mixed.

In the afternoon, financial firms such as numbers 43, 85, 232, 220, and 110 stepped in, and numbers 158, 160, and 152 also purchased shares. Rumors of a large currency issue became more urgent, and a buying frenzy erupted. Delayed delivery rose to a high of $788, and current delivery rose to a high of $784. Under the pressure of heavy selling of numbers 97, 2114, 156, 65, and 112, number 185 was sold off for current delivery, and number 89 was repeatedly suppressed. The gold market also fell back. At the close, current delivery gradually fell to a low of $748, and delayed delivery fell to a low of $763. The market stabilized slightly after the close. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yongsha, Jingfu, Meiya, and Qinxing fell slightly, Huafeng rose slightly, Xinguang fell back by half a percent, unpopular business shares had previously fallen to the limit down.

<h3>Textile Control Committee Approves Cotton Yarn Inspection Standards; Negotiates Loan for Purchasing Pudong Waste Cotton</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Textile Control Committee held a regular meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday, attended by Chairman Wu Guozhen, Vice Chairman Li Shengbo, and members Shu Yunzhang, Wang Qiyu, Wu Weijing, Guo Dihuo, Tang Xinghai, Rong Hongyuan, and Wang Yangxian. Also present were Liu Wenteng, Director of the Business Department of the Textile Control Committee, and Wang Zijian, Director of the Secretariat, among others. There were three important decisions:</p>
<p>(1) Approved the "Cotton Yarn Inspection Standards and Grade Regulations," which stipulated the following inspection items: (1) moisture content, (2) weight, (3) strength, (4) burning degree, (5) water and impurities content, (6) uniformity and color, (7) hanks content, (8) warp length, (9) packaging weight and tube yarn appearance. During inspection, scores were assigned based on the above nine items and several additional details. The quality and price difference grades of 20-count yarn were divided into five grades: Grade A, with a total average score of 91 to 100; Grade B, with 81 to 90; Grade C, with 71 to 80; Grade D, with 61 to 70; and Grade E, with below 60.</p>
<p>(2) Stipulated the price difference for 20-count yarn grades: The purchase price for Grade A yarn was $1,975,000 per piece (standard 400-pound yarn). For 20-count yarn with quality inferior to Grade A, the worst grade was reduced by 2.5% of the highest purchase price. By analogy, the lowest purchase price for 20-count yarn was $1,777,500.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the proposal to purchase Pudong waste cotton: It was resolved that state-owned and private yarn factories should purchase as much as possible, and the Textile Control Committee would negotiate loans with the Four Banks Joint Treasury. The amount would depend on the need. The Textile Control Committee would negotiate with the Four Banks based on the purchase figures proposed by the state-owned and private sectors.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Stable</h3>
<p>The yarn market stabilized yesterday. Retail sales were still sporadic. However, yarn mills seemed to have arranged their financing, so 20-count yarn continued to rise by one to two hundred thousand dollars. The sales channels for fine yarn were narrower, and prices remained stable.</p>
<h3>Appeal for Purchase of Autumn Silk</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Third District Raw Silk Industry Association, in order to request the Central Bank to purchase 1,500 piculs of autumn silk collected last year to relieve the urgent needs of the industry, specially convened a general membership meeting yesterday and immediately appointed more than 20 representatives to visit President Bei of the Central Bank to request: (1) The Central Bank should expedite the purchase of this batch of autumn silk. (2) The purchase price standard should be $6,326,000 per picul for Grade D autumn silk with a score of 78, plus $324,000 in interest, totaling $6,650,000. The purchase price standard should be $5,767,500 per picul for dried cocoons, plus $528,500 in interest, totaling $6,296,000. The representatives visited, but President Bei was away on official business and was received by Secretary Yang of the Central Bank. Mr. Wan Jingzhong, General Manager of the Zongzhong Sericulture Company, was specially invited to the Central Bank to negotiate. He said that he had already negotiated with President Bei and Director Lin of the Central Bank and planned to purchase this batch of raw silk, but it still needed to be submitted to President Song for approval before the purchase date and price could be determined. He promised to convey the intentions of the representatives to President Bei, and the representatives immediately took their leave.</p>
<h3>6,000 Cases of Japanese Rayon Arrive in Shanghai; Central Trust Bureau Approves Allocation</h3>
<p>It is reported that: As part of barter trade with Japan, the first shipment of 6,000 cases of Japanese rayon this year was scheduled to arrive yesterday, but due to weather conditions, it was unable to enter the port. The shipment, however, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 10:00 AM on a Japanese ship. Furthermore, it is learned that the Central Trust Bureau's initial allocation of rayon has been approved at this week's regular meeting of the sales agent. It was tentatively approved to allocate one-sixth of the total allocation to each industry in December of last year. The approved amount for the silk weaving industry was one-sixth, or 457 cases and 5 packages, and for the ribbon weaving industry, it was one-sixth, or 30 cases and 5 packages. As a result, 208 applicants from the silk weaving industry were allocated 322 cases of Toray rayon, with an allocation price of $2,770,000, totaling $891,940,000. However, there was still a surplus of 135 cases and 5 packages, and no applications have yet been received from the ribbon weaving industry. It is said that because most manufacturers have already closed for the Lunar New Year holiday since yesterday, the demand has sharply decreased, so the bureau has not yet approved the allocation of rayon to various industries for this month.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Trading Listless During Year-End Account Settlement</h3>
<p>As the Lunar New Year approaches, the tea industry is also settling its accounts, so supply and demand have weakened in recent days, and trading has declined. However, in terms of market sentiment, holders of goods still hold an optimistic view of the prospects for overseas trade, so there is little sign of fluctuation. The prices of various types of black and green teas have remained stable and unchanged. As for various domestic sales green teas such as Dragon Well, Dafang, and Baozhong, since sales in the Tianjin area have become stagnant, they only rely on slight sales in this city, so the process is not active, and prices are stable with a hint of softness.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Currently, countries such as the United States are still eager to purchase Chinese tea, but because there is a large gap between the selling prices, exports are extremely sluggish. Tea merchants are facing financial difficulties and cannot sustain themselves for long. They have repeatedly requested the government to purchase tea to provide relief. It is now learned that the initial steps are gradually being taken. It is said that the purchase amount will reach 60,000 piculs. In recent days, various tea firms and tea companies in this city have submitted the quantity of tea in stock and the production cost to the authorities, and it is hoped that the authorities can provide funds within days to help them tide over the Lunar New Year.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Exerts Effort to Suppress Gold Prices; Slight Setback Seen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, gold prices were still subdued by the Central Bank's control. Trading opened around $3,710,000, and reached a high of $3,730,000, but was immediately suppressed by the Central Bank. Initially, prices remained stable around $3,700,000, and at 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 92 bars at $3,700,000. Afterwards, supply repeatedly strengthened. Although buyers resisted, they eventually succumbed near noon and prices hovered around $3,670,000. In the afternoon, trading once fell below $3,650,000. The next day's trading opened higher due to rumors of a large currency issue, reaching a high of $3,750,000. The Central Bank continued to exert pressure, and prices retreated to around $3,700,000, down $15,000 from the previous close. The prices of jewelry gold and silver dollars remained unchanged. Financing was still stable, and interest rates remained around 1.5%. Foreign currencies also saw stable fluctuations. In the morning, the black market price for US dollars was still $6,500 to $6,600, but this price was difficult to exceed. At noon, it fell to around $6,400. In the afternoon, gold prices rose slightly. As a result, the closing price was still down $150 from the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were initially weak, but then stabilized. The general trend was still hovering around $1,250, and the result was similar to the previous close. Yesterday, Hong Kong dollar exchange rates traded frequently between $1,220 and $1,230. Indian rupees were between $1,470 and $1,490, and British pounds were around $1,930,000, but there were transactions only in name.</p>
<h3>British-Owned Yarn Factories Granted Permission to Order Foreign Cotton</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the British-owned yarn factory, Lanchang Company, Mr. Brown, and the General Manager of Ewo Yarns, Mr. Loper, visited Mr. Liu Wenteng, the Director of the Business Department of the Textile Control Committee, yesterday to discuss issues such as purchasing foreign cotton and how to adapt to the current textile control policies. Mr. Brown and Mr. Loper stated that they were happy to fulfill all the obligations of Chinese yarn factories. As for the foreign cotton they needed, they requested permission to order imports. Mr. Liu responded with two points: (1) It is hoped that British-owned yarn factories will join the Six-District Cotton Textile Association so that they can enjoy the same rights and obligations as the member yarn factories in China. (2) If the two British-owned yarn factories are willing to report their production volume to the association from January 1 of this year, and the government purchases half of it, then they can enjoy the right to apply for foreign cotton. They can directly contact the Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee.</p>
<h3>Brewing Price Increases for Oil Allocation; Raw Material Prices Rise, Increasing Production Costs; Factories Will Shut Down for the New Year and Workers Will Take Their Usual Holiday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to news from the Shanghai Edible Oil Joint Allocation Office: The office is advancing the allocation of oil that was originally scheduled for the days before the Lunar New Year to be completed before the 15th of this month due to the approaching Lunar New Year. However, recently, out of the seven private oil pressing factories that originally participated in the joint allocation, only Dadexin, Dayouyu, and Dachangxin are still participating due to factory shutdowns and restructuring. Therefore, the originally planned allocation of 500 piculs per day has been reduced to only 300 piculs. To make up for the shortfall, Mr. Zhang Chao, the chairman of the office, visited Mayor Wu some days ago and proposed that state-owned factories make up for the shortfall. Mayor Wu agreed in principle. Yesterday, Chief Ji of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau consulted with Mayor Wu and then reached an agreement with the China Vegetable Oil Factory to allocate an additional 1,300 piculs of oil to make up for the shortfall. It is reported that retail stores that received an oil allocation amount on the 15th but have not yet received the allocated oil in kind will be directly notified by the China Vegetable Oil Factory to receive their allocation within days.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a person in charge of the Shanghai Oil Pressing Industry Association, the price of raw materials for oil pressing has been rising faster than the price of edible oil recently. The current negotiated price for edible oil is still based on the price implemented at the end of November last year. At that time, soybeans were $27,000 per picul, but the market price of soybeans has recently risen to $40,000. In addition, labor costs have also increased by 50%. Besides, when adding transportation costs, interest, and taxes, the cost price of soybean oil is close to $190,000 per tank. The association is currently calculating production costs in order to apply to the authorities to adjust the negotiated price based on the facts. It is said that the price of oil in Yuanshan and other places has also reached $180,000. Therefore, if this city maintains the old price, the oil allocated to this city will likely flow to other places. The number of oil allocations from each factory will still be maintained at 500 piculs per day, and this number will be allocated until the 18th of this month. During the Lunar New Year, the oil pressing workers in each factory will, as usual, return to their hometowns for ten to fifteen days, so each factory may have a short-term shutdown.</p>
<h3>Import Goods Under US$500 Exempt from Import Permits; Prohibited Goods Still Banned; Revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade Implemented</h3>
<p>All goods carried in the luggage of incoming passengers, except for those prohibited from import as listed in Appendix (4) of the measures, are temporarily allowed to be imported without an import permit, which has been handled accordingly. It has been learned from the Jiang Customs that the Supreme Commander, in accordance with the objects subject to duty in passengers' luggage drafted by the Executive Committee of the Temporary Management Committee for Turn-Over, which belong to the items listed in Appendices (2) and (3) (A) and (B) of the measures, whose total value does not exceed US$500, or its equivalent value, do not require an import permit, but for passengers coming from Hong Kong and Macau, the limit is HK$200. Passengers coming from foreign countries via Hong Kong can bring goods subject to duty, and the standard for duty-free is also a total value not exceeding US$500, or its equivalent value, which will be implemented one month after the order is received. The items listed in Appendix (4) should be prohibited from import and will still be handled according to the regulations. It is learned that after receiving the order, the customs will implement it from January 30.</p>
<h3>Raw Materials Rise in Unison; Insurance Powder Price Surge Intensifies</h3>
<p>In the raw material market, as traders have all settled their year-end accounts, the market price of raw materials has been rising uniformly in recent days. Users, expecting even greater increases after the Lunar New Year, are vying to buy in before the end of the year. Insurance powder has already exceeded $500,000 per package. Bleaching powder, the market price for American goods yesterday, has reached between $6,200,000 and $6,300,000 per barrel. The market price for bleaching powder was over $7,000,000 in January of last year, but after a large amount of goods arrived, the price fell to between $1,100,000 and $1,200,000 per case, and now it has recovered to the price at that time last year.</p>
<h3>A Collection of News on Woolen Fabrics</h3>
<p>(1) The woolen fabric industry and the Western clothing industry, in view of the pressure of high-interest loans, are experiencing a large number of account disputes and bankruptcies, and they are wary of each other. Various taxes are heavy, and public and private expenses are huge. The cost of capital is high, and the profit is meager. Stocks have been decreasing year by year, and they all feel that they are in a dilemma.</p>
<p>(2) The import trading firms of woolen fabrics, previously faced with difficulties in government allocation of foreign exchange and the difficulty of applying for import permits, and later suffered from the strike of the woolen fabric manufacturers in this city, who reported to the government to ban the import of woolen fabrics, cannot place orders in the short term, and most of them are full of hidden worries.</p>
<p>(3) A field survey of various stores in the woolen fabric industry shows that, except for large-scale, large-capital families who have close contacts with factories and special power relations who remain silent, all other stores and shops, as well as the Western clothing industry, are opposed to the ban on woolen fabric imports. The reasons are that the production colors are not complete, the factories seek profits, the allocation is uneven, and the market prices will inevitably rise sharply. Non-insiders and ordinary stores must be indirectly controlled by large wholesalers, so many businesses will inevitably be unable to operate.</p>
<h3>Shortage of Hardware in Guannei; Abundant Supply from Northeast</h3>
<p>There is a great lack of hardware and equipment in Guannei, so the Northeast has been exporting a very large amount of hardware to Guannei recently. From New Year's Day this year to today, the materials approved for export by the Economic and Trade Commission include 30 tons of steel pipes, 40 tons of electrical boxes, 10 tons of steel plates, 67 tons of fir, 572 catties of galvanized iron, 12,280 catties of lead wire, 100 tons of copper and copper products, 6,000 catties of iron, 500 catties of ingot iron, 35 tons of angle iron, and 30 tons of iron beds. Other items such as nickel ingots, black pliers, welding rods, wire nails, carbolic acid, caustic soda, mica coal, white ceramic tiles, and washbasins have also been exported in considerable quantities. Among them, there was a request to export 18,000 willow trees, but it was not approved because the Northeast needed them greatly.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Sales Slack; Flour Stagnant, Edible Oil Active</h3>
<p>A total of 4,500 to 4,600 piculs of rice arrived in the city from north and south. Although the supply was scarce, due to tight financing, sales remained sluggish. Early in the morning, the price of japonica rice in the north market was firm, but it weakened in the afternoon. The south market tended to soften. As a result, both markets became weak. There was little supply and demand for indica rice, and there was no rise or fall. Baiyuan and Yinyuan rice had brisk sales and rose by one to two thousand dollars. Local oil factories continued to purchase Northeast soybeans and Yangtze River soybeans, and the prices rose by three to five hundred dollars. However, Doudou remained mediocre. High-quality Teodou was continuously procured in Nanyang, and the market remained firm. The price of adzuki beans remained unchanged, and there was little change in cowpeas. The sales of sesame seeds were not smooth, and the market softened. There was demand for shelled peanuts as the Lunar New Year approached, and local merchants purchased them from each other. Actual sales were quite strong, and the price rose by two to three thousand dollars. Trade in soybean cakes and pomace oil was sluggish, with a nominal firm price and a hidden decline. Flour was weak and declined, and foreign flour and domestic flour both fell by five to six hundred dollars. Miscellaneous flour was also quite stagnant. The oil market was slightly mixed. Sales of unrefined oil in barrels were brisk, and the price rose by one to two thousand dollars. Unrefined oil in baskets was mediocre. Refined oil was similar, but sesame oil from small carts remained brisk and continued to rise by three to five thousand dollars, reaching a new high price. At the close of the market, vegetable oil factories sold a lot of unrefined sesame oil and refined oil, and the situation was stable.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th Dispatch] The issue of the 148 government-funded students selected by the Ministry of Education for overseas study has been handled by the Ministry of Education in conjunction with Mr. Ross, the head of the British Council in this city, and Mr. Mei, the head of the United States Information Service, as well as the China Institute in America, to negotiate with schools in the United Kingdom and the United States to arrange for Chinese students. Since the United Kingdom and the United States have such organizations to handle overseas student matters, it is easier to resolve. Other countries are also being contacted. However, due to the current semester, it is not easy to reach a conclusion on the investigation of which subjects can be arranged for overseas study in foreign schools at one time. It is feared that government-funded students will not be able to participate in the fall semester. Among the 1,200 self-funded students who passed the exam, 102 have completed the procedures for overseas study to date.</p>

<h3>Last Night's Basketball Friendly Match: Hualian Green Team Defeats Jiaotong University; Jiaotong University's Men's and Women's Teams Suffered Setbacks; The Battle Was Wonderful; Watching the Old Players Show Their Skills Was Very Beneficial</h3>

Chen Ling, the director of physical education of the school, invited the famous Hualian team and the Women's Green Team for a friendly match at the school's gymnasium at 6:30 last night, so that the men's and women's team members could watch and learn. There were more than 2,000 spectators, mostly students from the school. The battle was quite wonderful and fierce. Although the men's and women's teams of Jiaotong University were defeated successively, they must have benefited a lot. The result of the men's game was 60 to 44, and the women's game was 42 to 6.</p>
<p>Jiaotong University Girls Encountered a Powerful Enemy for the First Time</p>
<p>In the first match, Jiaotong University's women's team played against the Green Team. The referee was Zhang Jianbing. The veteran players of the Green Team, Huang Mingyuan, Rong Shujian, and Liu Zhenbao, all played. The female generals of Jiaotong University seemed flustered when they encountered a powerful enemy for the first time. Liu Zhenbao of the Green Team scored with a free throw, opening the record. Huang Mingyuan then put in two goals under the basket. Zhenbao and Shujian scored continuously. Zhang Miao and Wang Zujun of Jiaotong University took two long shots, but both fell out of bounds due to insufficient strength. In the first quarter, the Green Team had eleven points, and Jiaotong University had zero. At the beginning of the second quarter, Huang Mingyuan of the Green Team opened fire first, and Rong Shujian then threw a goal. After five minutes, Jiaotong University still had zero points, and the Green Team had increased to nineteen points. At this time, Wu Ailian fouled, and Qiu Yongling of Jiaotong University scored one point. After the duck egg was broken, the first half was over, and the Green Team led by 21 to 1.</p>
<p>The Battle Was Wonderful, and the Green Team Won a Great Victory</p>
<p>After the orange break, the teams changed sides and fought again. Huang Mingyuan and Wang Weizhen of the Green Team scored two more goals. Li Wenfu of Jiaotong University was transferred from the backcourt to the vanguard and was quite active. She turned around and put the ball in front of the basket, and the students of Jiaotong University cheered constantly. However, Huang Mingyuan and Wang Weizhen of the Green Team became even more rampant. Wang Zujun of Jiaotong University scored a free throw. At the end of the third quarter, the Green Team had an absolute advantage with 38 to 4. In the last quarter, the female generals of Jiaotong University tried their best to fight, and the battle was extremely exciting. The Green Team's score dropped sharply. As a result, the Green Team won a great victory with 42 to 6.</p>
<p>Jiaotong University Fought Hard and Once Headed</p>
<p>In the final match, the men of Jiaotong University met the veterans of Hualian. The referee was still Zhang Jianbing. Ni Ziqi, the captain of Jiaotong University, made a free throw first, opening the record. Wu Chengzhang returned the respect with one point. Yang Xiehe of Jiaotong University was small and specialized in attacking from the bottom, and he succeeded. They led 3 to 1. Chen Xuechong put the ball in, and Zhuo Guorong made a free throw. Jiaotong University's offensive was also fierce. Yuan Peiyuan sent the ball in with one hand, and they tied at 5. Shen Yang and others suddenly became active and scored two goals, making it 13 to 9. Jiaotong University headed for the first time. Hualian counterattacked, leading 19 to 15 in the first quarter. At the beginning of the second quarter, the two sides were in a tug-of-war, each with their own gains. In the first half, Hualian led by 33 to 29, leading by two and a half goals.</p>
<p>Hualian Veterans Finally Won a Great Victory</p>
<p>After the break, Hualian's lineup changed greatly. Li Zhenzhong entered the arena, strengthening both offense and defense. Jiaotong University had no power to fight back. As a result, Hualian won 51 to 30. In the last quarter, the veterans felt that the overall situation was set and did not need to score, so they attacked less and defended more. The young generals of Jiaotong University did not give up the opportunity. Shen Beizhang and Yuan Peiyuan made many contributions. When the time was up, Jiaotong University was defeated by Hualian with 44 to 60.</p>

<h3>Using Fresh and Clean Blood Transfusion to Forge a New Jiangsu</h3>
<p>— Zhenjiang, 2nd Quick Dispatch. Our Reporter, Kou Xianglin</p>
<p>Jiangsu is like a patient recovering from a long illness. It not only needs active treatment and surgery but also needs post-operative recuperation. The Communist army in northern Jiangsu is fiercely burning the torches of cruelty, starting to expand the so-called "liberated areas." For several months, our people in northern Jiangsu have been unanimously demanding to return home actively and to reorganize the tens of thousands of acres of fertile farmland that had been destroyed by the Communist army. After the National Army began a defensive counterattack, the Communist army could not withstand a single blow. Gao Bao and Huai Gong along the canal line were abandoned, and important strongholds along the Tongyu line were abandoned. Lian Gao also fell into internal strife and was abandoned. It was like the withering of leaves in winter. At this point, the clear prospect of the situation in northern Jiangsu has shone before our eyes.</p>
<p>Provincial Cadre Training Corps Establishes Training Class for Transferred Military Officers</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Cadre Training Corps, in order to seize this prospect and await the arrival of reality, established a training class for transferred military officers on December 1, under the four major principles and objective requirements of establishing a new era, a new Jiangsu, new cadres, and new tasks. About 815 people selected from the 17th Officer Corps of Wuxi, 83 people from the Provincial Security Command, and 37 officers and men from the corps' excess personnel participated in the training, totaling 935 people. This group, survivors of eight years of bloody resistance against the Japanese, stepped into the Provincial Cadre Training Corps without hesitation to receive transfer training, hoping to unite the three million Jiangsu compatriots to restore and build a glorious new Jiangsu.</p>
<p>Days passed, ten days, twenty days. Zhenjiang society was still as calm as a stagnant pool. On the road, one occasionally saw two or three polite figures wearing soldiers' uniforms, some even wearing glasses, hurriedly stepping into bookstores or department stores to select and buy what they needed, and then hurriedly walking back. Talkative shop assistants began to discuss, "I think these must be the transferred military officers we welcomed last time." "How do you know?" "I think your eyes are simply not working. They are wearing soldiers' uniforms, but are ordinary soldiers this neat? They are polite and very courteous. I can tell at a glance that they are officers." "If they are officers, why are they wearing soldiers' uniforms and not wearing collar insignia?" "You are really stupid, they are receiving training; they are students." This was the only ripple. The people of Zhenjiang seemed to have long forgotten the existence of the transferred military officers.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of December 24, every newspaper office and Jinghu reporter stationed in Zhenjiang received an invitation from the Provincial Cadre Training Corps, stating that the transferred military officers of the corps, in order to express their gratitude for the warm welcome and generous assistance from all walks of life in the provincial capital, had specially arranged a tea party on the 26th.</p>
<p>That afternoon, with drizzling rain, the reporters took the welcoming car straight to the 35th Standard outside the East Gate. A red silk soft plaque was hung at the entrance of the training center, with beautifully written artistic characters "Welcome Leaders from All Walks of Life and the Press in the Provincial Capital to Visit and Guide the Corps." The walls were covered with brightly colored welcome slogans. The car stopped in front of the auditorium. More than a dozen transferred military officers wearing red silk sashes raised their hands as if welcoming distinguished guests, leading the reporters to their Zhongshan Room. The room was decorated exceptionally neatly. Three rows of tables were arranged in a long, slender "mountain" shape, with the stage forming the base of the mountain character. The red, blue, and white tablecloth was matched with simple and elegant potted flowers. In front of each seat was a paper bag containing tea and snacks, and inside the bag was a small leaflet wrapped around four Morris cigarettes. The leaflet contained a concise and enthusiastic welcome speech. Can you say that the officers are unrefined? They are so attentive. At 2:15, all the guests arrived, more than a hundred people in suits, military uniforms, Zhongshan suits, and long robes, truly representing "soldiers and civilians."</p>
<p>Defenders of the Nation Will Become Pillars of the Country</p>
<p>The tea party began without any ceremony. A young officer, Cao Ziqiang, served as temporary chairman, delivering a clear and enthusiastic welcome speech, and expressing their wishes: "We must inherit the spirit of resistance against Japan, build a new Jiangsu, and complete the great task of nation-building." Although he didn't use obscure language or quote classical texts, his attitude was as elegant as a scholar. Next, the Director of Education, Xu Wentian, gave a speech, reporting on the preparation and training process of the transfer training. He promised that this group of transferred military officers would not disappoint the government and the people, "In times of war, they are the defenders of the nation; in times of peace, they must be the pillars of the country."</p>
<p>Continuing were the representatives of the transferred military officers, Zuo Zhiren and Sun Zhejun, who began to report. They told everyone from their own perspectives: "How has the government treated us unfairly? Shedding blood and sweat to fight for national survival is the sacred mission of Chinese men. There must be demobilization after mobilization. After the reorganization of the troops, the government organized officer corps for us, still paying salaries, and established training institutions to teach us transfer skills. We can only be grateful and excited." "We hope that society will give us more help and encouragement." Next were speeches from the guests. Finally, the reporters also especially liked to speak, "During the war, we met on the battlefield; in the future, we will walk together on the road of nation-building." After the tea and snacks were eaten, dusk gradually enveloped the earth. In the drizzling rain, we still took the original car back to our respective nests.</p>
<p>The 35th Standard: Incubating New Cadres</p>
<p>The 35th Standard is a sacred place worth remembering. There, cadres who will be sent to various counties in Jiangsu to build the cradle of a new Jiangsu are being incubated. On the day of departure, the reporter made a very detailed visit and interview, and I hereby report as follows:</p>
<p>Stepping through the gate is a large parade ground with sports equipment such as basketball. More than twenty white-walled thatched houses are built around it. Walking south out of the large walled circle, there is another earthen enclosure, also with more than a dozen white-walled thatched houses. This group of demobilized military officers is active within these two walled circles.</p>
<p>This group is divided into ten classes: civil affairs, finance, construction, society, land and food, accounting, health, land administration, security, and air defense. Except for education, almost every department of the provincial and county administrative departments has a class. The largest class is the security class, with 251 people, and the smallest is the health administration class, with only about 20 people. The various subjects are too complex to calculate, from public opinion organizations to banning opium and drugs, from national finance to bacterial disinfection, from river and sea engineering to horticulture... it is almost a compilation of social sciences and natural sciences. All the lecturers are mostly heads of departments and bureaus of the provincial government or famous scholars from Beijing, Shanghai, and other places.</p>
<p>A Simple Timetable Shows a Tense Life</p>
<p>Here is their daily timetable: get up at 6:00 a.m., assemble at 6:30 a.m. for flag-raising, morning exercises, and a 20-minute motivational speech, breakfast at 7:10 a.m., from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., four regular classes, each lasting 50 minutes, with only 10 minutes of rest between classes, lunch at 12:10 p.m., from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., three regular classes, from 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., extracurricular activities, or small group discussions and other standardized activities, dinner at 6:10 p.m., from 6:30 p.m. to 8:20 p.m., self-study, and then go to bed at 9:00 p.m., that is to say, from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., they are living a tense life every moment.</p>
<p>Can they handle such a tense life? The answer is definitely yes. Not only can they handle it, but they are still finding things to do even during the ten or twenty minutes of rest. As long as it doesn't rain or snow, as soon as class is over, basketball, football, and badminton will never stop for a moment. The recreation and cultural groups in the Zhongshan Room are their happy gardens. The ping-pong ball is hit halfway, and the class bell rings, so they put down their rackets, "Two, three, remember to come back after class," chess pieces are moved a few times, and they rush to class, he greets the administrator, "Comrade, please don't mess up the chess pieces, we'll be back after class," more than twenty newspapers are often surrounded by dozens of people watching.</p>
<p>"Pihuang" is the most popular entertainment. A Peking opera instructor is often pulled to the point of exhaustion, but he has a solution. He adopts Mr. Tao Xingzhi's "little teacher system." Self-study class is relatively free. In the evening, the gongs and drums of the Peking opera troupe in the Zhongshan Room are beating loudly. The jinghu and sanxian rarely stop. "Pull for me to sing, Xipi Daoban," Sheng, Dan, Jing, Mo, Chou, all types are available. They line up to sing.</p>
<p>Ideological and Political Work Does Not Allow a Moment of Rest</p>
<p>The ideological and political instructors are very good at planning. They are like monkeys in a stable, unwilling to let anyone have a moment of rest. Their idea is "If tension is not enough, it is relaxation." They divide one month into four central training weeks. The first week is the organization week. In addition to dividing classes and forming teams, they also organize various ball teams, reading rooms, music and drama groups, and various competition units. Moreover, they also help the transferred military officers form alumni associations. These items are all successful activities carried out in their spare time. The second week is the practice week. All organizations are stepping up their activities according to plan. The third week is the competition week. Complex competition scenes unfold. After the flag-raising on Monday, the tug-of-war competition begins. Each group of twenty people hangs red and yellow sash belts, and the battle lines are clear. With a sound of the silver horn, the two sides fight each other. Cheerleaders cheer from the side, "Use your strength! Huh! Ha! Use your strength, Hang Yo!" One minute, two minutes, neither side gives in. The competitors pull until their faces are red and their ears are red, and the cheerleaders shout until they are exhausted. Suddenly, a gentleman shouted from the crowd, "Kill!" Immediately, people's faces became serious and their muscles tensed up: "Kill!" "Kill!" The sound shook the sky, and fire flashed in their eyes, madly shouting "Kill!" They tasted the life of killing enemies in those years. "Classmates: this is tug-of-war, this is not a battlefield, why are you shouting kill?" "Yes, this is not a battlefield," "Haha! It's really feverish." A burst of laughter, people returned to rationality, and the competitors laughed until they bent over. The silver horn rang again, deciding the outcome of the first match. For a whole week, people were busy competing in a round-robin basketball competition. The fourth company often won, because there were two old players on their team, Wen Yun was the basketball representative of Liling District in Hunan, and Zhang Hongjun was a first-class athlete in the Jiangsu Provincial Games, who had both been on big stages and shown their skills. They felt that the internal competition was not enough, so they wrote to the Jiangsu Medical and Political College to challenge them, but the reply said that they were too busy with their studies and would learn from them another day. The ping-pong match was a fierce battle for a week. In the end, Zhuang Yan and Sun Tongxue won first place. His strategy was a "patience" character, accepting adversity and not challenging, deeply understanding the essence of using softness to overcome strength.</p>
<p>Small Group Discussions: Records are More Than a Foot Thick</p>
<p>Small group discussions were also held twice. Because there were not enough houses and instructors to allocate, they were divided into 36 small groups to discuss the topic of "Common Sense and Specialized Skills." One student said, "Our country's officialdom has always only paid attention to generalists and neglected specialists. Real water conservancy experts and architects are regarded as subordinates and treated as minor officials. This trend has not ended yet. For example, the Huai River Guidance Committee, the Yellow River Conservancy Committee... I think..." "Chairman, I have some opinions, to supplement, European and American countries rely on their science and precise division of labor, they live better than us. In the war, we recognized the advantages of others, but our administrative staff are still handling affairs with common sense. If this continues, we will only fall further behind. We must understand science and value specialized skills in order to avoid the weaknesses of a government without intelligence and laws that cannot be relied upon." "I think European and American countries are progressing, the whole world is progressing, whether we like it or not, China must also progress to become scientific and specialized, otherwise, we will be led by the nose, and end up like India, which would be terrible. I think administrative staff should have abundant common sense, and especially specialized skills." "Yes, the world is progressing and becoming specialized, and China must also be like this. If we cannot progress and cannot specialize, then we will fall behind"... This is a very small part of one of the 36 groups. The records of all the small group discussions are more than a foot thick.</p>
<p>Every Saturday night, there is a get-together held in the auditorium. This group of transferred military officers has everything prepared, it can be the sonorous and passionate Shandong drum, or the soft and charming Suzhou ballad, swords, spears, knives, halberds, boxing skills and wrestling, violin, harmonica, English songs, everything is available. The most popular is Peking opera. The corps is equipped with gongs, drums, and other stage equipment. As long as they borrow a set of costumes, they can perform various operas. They like to put "Bie Ji" and "Zhaojun" together. They sympathize with the suffering Wang Baochuan, but it doesn't matter, people will always come back. Several female leads in the Grand Theatre have been hired twice, but drama cannot be performed because the time is too short and the curriculum is tight, so there is no time to rehearse. Every Saturday, people enter the auditorium with the joy of children celebrating the New Year, and happily spend two to four hours. A month of intensive training ended on December 28. Now, they are busy with distribution for practice. The distribution areas and work departments are mostly based on each person's ability and aspirations. The provincial government's departments, bureaus, and county-level institutions north and south of the Yangtze River will add this group of fresh and clean blood. They are shouting: "We must inherit the spirit of resistance against Japan, build a new Jiangsu, and complete the great task of nation-building."</p>

<h3>Exploration of the Huainan Railway</h3>
<p>— Wuhu, 5th Dispatch. Our Special Correspondent, Kang Feng</p>
<p>In the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, the Huainan Railway, which connects the Huai River and the Yangtze River in Anhui Province, with more than 200 kilometers of plains, designed a plan in the Nanjing National Government's Construction Committee. After six years of surveying, construction, and laying tracks, in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, a locomotive puffing black smoke dragged trains began to run on the Jianghuai Plain, transporting rice, grains, livestock, cotton, cloth, general merchandise, and passengers. The capital of this railway was 6 million yuan. The starting point was Yuxikou Station, across the river from Wuhu on the north bank of the Yangtze River, and the terminal was Tianjia'an Station on the south bank of the Huai River. This railway was named Huainan. The fertile Chaohu Lake and rice granary area between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, as well as the grain area in the Huai River Basin, all benefited from the completion of this railway, which resulted in lower export costs. This allowed the economic foundation of 40,000 square kilometers between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers to be consolidated and improved.</p>
<p>In just over a year, this railway was automatically destroyed in the winter of the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China because it became a battlefield for the war against Japan. The bitterness of the initial retreat and destruction can still be vividly described by several veterans of the Huainan Railway, such as Hu Weizhong and Deputy Director Ning Shufan, but these have all become permanent relics. When Director Wu Jingqing led several receiving committee members, including Hu Weizhong, to receive the railway in the winter of the thirty-fourth year, the railway, which had not been seen for eight years, had changed its route, except for the Jiulonggang Railway Bureau, which still maintained its original appearance.</p>
<p>Became the Tianbang Branch Line</p>
<p>After the Japanese occupied the Huainan Railway, because the initial motivation for building this railway was to smoothly transport coal from the Datong and Huainan coal mines, and these two coal mines did not have time to be completely destroyed, and the Japanese needed coal, they decided to use the railway as a special coal transportation line. Originally, the route from Tianjia'an to Yuxikou could transport coal to the Yangtze River port and then transfer it upstream to Anqing, Jiujiang, and even Wuhan, but the smooth transportation of abundant grain between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers was also the main factor in building the road. The Japanese prioritized military affairs. Since the production and import of gasoline could not meet the needs of naval vessels, and the number of Japanese transportation and coal-fired ships on the Yangtze River was increasing, the need for Huainan coal became an important stronghold in the Japanese military and industrial mines. Therefore, rather than exposing the route to the 200-kilometer Jianghuai Plain controlled by Chinese guerrillas, it was better to turn northeast at Shuijiahu Station, parallel to the Huai River, and head towards Bengbu, an important station on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. The Japanese did what they said. The 88-kilometer Tianbang branch line from Tianjia'an via Shuijiahu to Bengbu became the new Huainan under Japanese control. Its role was to continuously transport coal every day, with rolling black trains going to supply Japanese warships to bombard the Yangtze River basin and the unyielding countryside that the Japanese wanted to destroy.</p>
<p>New Look of Huainan</p>
<p>When Director Wu Jingqing came to receive this only 88-kilometer railway, only 28 kilometers from Tianjia'an to Shuijiahu were passable. Deputy Director Ning Shufan said that he could laugh at himself, a complete Huainan Railway Bureau agency had only 28 kilometers of railway to manage. In five months this year, this group of transportation cadres tried every means to repair the 60 kilometers from Shuijiahu to Bengbu. On June 1, this section of the roadbed, which had been built and then destroyed by the Japanese, was relaid with rails and trains began to run. From then on, two mixed passenger and freight trains and two coal trains departed from Tianjia'an to Bengbu every day. Similarly, two mixed passenger and freight trains came from Bengbu. Two empty coal trains also hurried to load coal and leave.</p>
<p>I saw the current appearance of the Huainan Railway again at Shuijiahu Station. This station only has one side platform. The station building is a low wooden house built by the Japanese. I saw Stationmaster Huang Chongren holding red and green flags standing on the platform to assist in directing. A mixed passenger and freight train from Tianjia'an to Bengbu entered the station. I counted from beginning to end, one second-class passenger car, one third-class passenger car, twelve 15-ton iron-sheet carriages, inside were fourth-class passengers and chickens, ducks, tobacco, cotton, miscellaneous grains, and other commercial goods, and finally twelve 30-ton open carriages loaded with coal, a heavy train of twenty-six carriages!</p>
<p>After more than ten minutes of passengers and goods getting off and on the train, I saw this train roaring and heading to Bengbu. This is a sign of good times. Although many people were drowned and many houses were washed away in the Huai River Basin this year, this 88-kilometer "iron-made Huai River" parallel to the Huai River is smoothly transporting a batch of good people on the Huai River who are seeking a way to survive! The Huainan Railway currently has 15 locomotives and more than 200 passenger, freight, and coal cars. Eight locomotives are running on the railway every day. The mixed passenger and freight train I saw at Shuijiahu Station had a total of twenty-six carriages. The total number of carriages transporting coal, goods, and passengers on the railway every day is more than 150. Calculated in this way, the utilization rate of transportation equipment on the Huainan Railway is superficially about 60%.</p>
<p>In fact, those locomotives and carriages that have not been running are basically faulty, so the Huainan Railway Locomotive Factory has an endless amount of work to do. Moreover, the trains running on the road need to be checked and repaired after a certain period of time.</p>
<p>This locomotive factory is located in Jiulonggang, where the Railway Bureau is located, opposite Jiulonggang Station across the railway tracks. Factory Director Liu Xinmin and Director of the Locomotive Department of the Railway Bureau, Lu Fengshan, have both worked in many other railway locomotive factories. Entering the factory, one is fascinated by the sight of the belts turning the lathes and the sound of workers hammering steel.</p>
<p>Deputy Director Ning Shufan led me to look at each part in detail, but a person who has not spent a lot of time and energy on mechanical work cannot absorb and remember these colorful images all at once. However, after this visit and inquiry, I came to understand some common sense about locomotives. For example, a complete locomotive is divided into two parts: the boiler and the coal-water car. In the locomotive factory, the firebox plate of the boiler of a locomotive was too thin due to long-term use and had decayed. This locomotive was driven back to patch the firebox plate to prevent the boiler from exploding and causing the train to stop on the road, blocking the continuous traffic. The Locomotive Department has mechanics at each station on the entire line to check the locomotive and passenger and freight car parts at any time. A careful passenger will find some workers covered in oil stains when the train they are riding enters and exits the station, bending down to look under the car as if looking for something important. Those are the people from the Locomotive Department checking the wheel axles for the safety of passengers and traffic.</p>
<p>The locomotive's coal car water tank can be filled with ten tons of water, which can only supply the consumption of 80 kilometers of driving. After driving 80 kilometers, it is necessary to stop at a station with a water tower to add water in order to continue driving.</p>
<p>The reason why train traffic can avoid accidents is absolutely related to the Railway Bureau's strict implementation of the train inspection and repair system. The phenomenon of automobile traffic breakdowns is so common because there is no strict inspection and repair system implemented in automobile traffic administration. Although the Huainan Railway is currently an inland short-distance coal transportation line, it has never had an accident since it was opened to traffic, and the trains are absolutely on time. This has fully demonstrated the business spirit of a modern enterprise: Jiunenggang Locomotive Factory and the Locomotive Department's mobilization are the main reason for it!</p>
<p>The Jiulong Machinery Factory was a pile of scrap iron and garbage when it was taken over. The factory shed was an empty frame. First, the roof was repaired, and then the factory floor was paved with cement and the empty slots for repairing cars were repaired. The factory floor was repaired, and in April of this year, passenger and freight cars could be repaired and some minor work could be done. In October, locomotives could be brought into the factory for major repairs, but it still lacks the most important piece of machinery and equipment, which is the 50-ton crane. The Huainan Railway Bureau hopes that the General Administration can allocate a large crane for their use, otherwise, when they repair the wheel axle part of a locomotive, lifting the boiler and the frame will take too long because it is done by manpower. In terms of work efficiency, it is neither compatible nor economical.</p>
<p>The waste materials left by the Japanese have been used and transformed by the machinery factory into six passenger cars and twenty freight cars. It is a poor country's poor method. You would never think that this is the masterpiece of the machinery factory workers when you sit in a passenger car made of waste materials. I saw with my own eyes the technicians spraying paint on a passenger car, and another new car was completed.</p>
<p>There is a one-ton capacity iron melting furnace in the sand casting room, and preparations are still being made to build a three-ton furnace. Parts of the locomotive are cast here for use. The train aspect has entered the era of pure domestic goods, and there is no need to rely on others like steel rails and bridges.</p>

<h3>The Prospect of New Huainan</h3>
<p>The Huainan Railway itself is not content with just transporting coal on the 88-kilometer Tianbu line to illuminate Nanjing, Wuxi, and warm Shanghai. The Huainan Railway is capable and has extra capacity, desiring to contribute to the overall economy of the Jianghuai region!</p>
<p>The restoration of the old Huainan railway line, from Shuijiahu to Yuxikou, a distance of 210 kilometers, is the most immediate dream of the Huainan Railway's first step. Every Huainan Railway employee is thinking about the day when the train on this railway can speed to Hefei, to Chaoxian, and finally stop at Yuxikou on the rolling Yangtze River. That will be when the Huainan Railway can fully display its strengths!</p>
<p>The Huainan Railway Public Works Department is working on restoring the old track. The head of the department, Mr. Li Jingshu from Jiangxi, has experienced the difficult mountain crossing and valley spanning projects when building the Qian-Gui Railway. Restoring the Huainan Railway is something that can be done with eyes closed. Therefore, Mr. Li has no worries about the restoration project and only hopes that the materials needed for the restoration will be allocated as soon as possible.</p>
<p>As early as half a year ago, the bridge piers of the four railway bridges along the Huainan Railway line had already been built with steel-reinforced concrete. The longest Zhegao River railway bridge by Chaohu Lake, 110 meters long with 19 piers, was also built early on. The Ministry of Transportation has also agreed to allocate 8.1 billion yuan in construction funds, of which approximately 500 million yuan is needed to rebuild the Yuxikou wharf. The first project to commence is this wharf because, as soon as the leftover materials from the US military, including railway tracks and bridge materials, arrive, Yuxikou will immediately need the wharf to unload these materials brought by large ships.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Jingshu described the upcoming Huainan Railway restoration project:</p>
<p>"We plan to start construction in three locations as soon as the materials arrive. Materials will be transported from Shanghai via the Jinpu Railway to Shuijiahu Station on the Huainan Railway to be laid towards Hefei. Materials will also be transported from Shanghai via the Yangtze River to Yuxikou, across from Wuhu, to be laid towards Guoxian. Furthermore, materials will be transported by small wooden boats from Yuxikou to support Guoxian. Working simultaneously from these three points, we plan to lay five kilometers of railway per day at each point, totaling fifteen kilometers. Thus, the entire 210 kilometers can be connected in just fifteen days. Of course, the time spent erecting the four railway bridges will take longer, and transporting materials to the construction sites will take even longer. Our plan is to guarantee complete operation within six months of receiving the materials."</p>
<p>The second dream of the Huainan Railway is to have the Huainan Railway branch off at Shenjiaxiang Station, seven kilometers from Yuxikou, and run south to reach Erba, directly across from Wuhu. From Shenjiaxiang to Yuxikou is only seven kilometers, but to Erba is eighteen kilometers. Why will the future Huainan terminus be changed to Erba? Readers must note that the water distance from Yuxikou to Wuhu, across the Yangtze River, is approximately fifteen kilometers, while Erba is directly across from Wuhu on the northern bank of the Yangtze River, only two kilometers apart, just like Pukou directly across the Yangtze River from Xiaguan in Nanjing.</p>
<p>Because this 18-kilometer rerouting project from Shenjiaxiang to Erba runs almost parallel to the Yangtze River current, the roadbed height must exceed the Yangtze River water level during the 1931 flood by more than six meters to ensure traffic during high water. Now, the survey of this future new line has been completed. The terrain in the 18-kilometer area along the entire line is above the high water level of 1931. Therefore, the roadbed filling project will only need to be raised by five meters. However, the filling project and the construction of a large bridge (12 meters high, 180 meters wide) across the Cao Yun River on this new section of road are quite large. It is estimated that the cost of this short new road will not be small, but the transportation system often considers permanent benefits and is willing to spend a huge amount of money at one time, so the construction of this new section is inevitable.</p>
<p>After the Erba new line is completed, the direct distance from Erba to Wuhu across the Yangtze River is 1.3 kilometers, and the diagonal waterway is 2.1 kilometers. Landing on the Wuhu riverside at a point above the Wuhu Chajishan Hospital, and then building a two-kilometer branch line from the landing point to connect with the Jiangnan Railway's Wuhu riverside station, the joint transportation of Huainan, Jiangnan, and Jinpu can be connected without hindrance. The beautiful scene of the Chengping ferry transporting passengers and the Changjiang ferry transporting trains between Nanjing and Pukou can also be reenacted in Erba, Wuhu.</p>
<p>Ning Shufan said that after the Huainan Railway is restored, it will certainly have extra capacity to contribute more to Anhui's transportation. For example, the buses currently running on the Huainan Railway roadbeds from Shuijiahu to Hefei, and from Hefei to Yuxikou, can be rerouted to the Hefei-Luan line, so that the tea from the tea gardens in the Dabie Mountains of western Anhui can be sold more conveniently. Buses can also run from Tianjia'an to Shouxian. Small boats can still run from Tianjia'an along the Huai River to Fengtai, Zhengyangguan, so that the Huai River basin's grains can be transported via the Huainan Railway to Wuhu or Bengbu Pukou for export.</p>
<p>At that time, the Huainan Railway can truly exert its great power to transport goods between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, like an iron horse full of energy, running non-stop for the economic improvement of the Jianghuai Plain!</p>
<h3>Footprints in Vietnam</h3>
<p>— January 1st Dispatch from Hanoi, by Jiesun</p>
<p>Recently, the Khmer Revolutionary Party killed several French missionaries. As a result, when the French army entered Battambang, several monks in the temples were "lottery winners," as a reprisal, their corpses lay scattered, stained with blood. Everywhere on the walls were slogans written by Khmer revolutionaries in Chinese, Khmer, Siamese, English, and French: "Armies of invaders are not welcome," "Imperialists are the public enemies of small nations," a contrasting comparison with the truth.</p>
<p>The number of overseas Chinese in the Four Provinces reaches 200,000, with Battambang accounting for almost half. Two-thirds have already moved into Siam territory. In addition to real estate, important properties have also been moved into Siamese territory. Those who remain there are often robbed and killed. The French side has repeatedly stated that they are fully responsible for protection, but they have not taken any effective measures. Our consulate general in Saigon sent Deputy Consul Xu to Battambang to negotiate with the French side, but after the negotiation, there was no follow-up.</p>
<p>At night, residents hide in their homes, afraid to take a single step or leave. French soldiers also huddle in their camps, afraid to go out. The sparse sound of mallets, along with the distant barking of dogs, makes one feel as if they are in a desolate village, further increasing the terror and desolation.</p>
<p>Land transportation from the Four Provinces to Sogou and Saigon has been completely cut off. After attending the handover ceremony, I visited General Dai Zhongji, a trusted aide to the French government representative in the Four Provinces. With his various assistance, I was able to leave Battambang and stay in Phnom Penh on a French military plane.</p>
<p>Phnom Penh is the capital of Cambodia. That day was the birthday of Cambodian King Sihanouk. French dignitaries from Saigon and our Consul General in Saigon, Yi Fengzao, and others came to offer their congratulations. The scene was grand and extraordinarily lively. It was a scene of peace and prosperity. However, the suburbs are full of forts, and people are panicking. Many wealthy overseas Chinese businessmen have already moved to Saigon.</p>
<p>Under the Cambodian King, there are prime ministers and ministers of all kinds. It can truly be said that although the sparrow is small, it has all the vital organs. At a reception, I was able to have a conversation with the Cambodian King. When I mentioned the current situation of French-Vietnamese relations and Ho Chi Minh's role in Vietnam's struggle for independence, he did not say a word. He only praised the generous treatment he received from France when he was in Paris. He also emphasized that the recovery of the Four Provinces was entirely the result of France accepting his request. The French directorial technique can be said to be quite clever, and Sihanouk's performance is also quite realistic.</p>
<p>In Saigon City and on the Mekong River</p>
<p>After the grand ceremony ended, the guests dispersed, and I left Phnom Penh. The highway from Phnom Penh to Saigon is still passable. However, the Vietnamese people's will to resist the French is very firm. They often abandon their fields and carry their wives and children deep into the interior, and then fight with their lives. Along the highway and in places that the French can reach, nine out of ten houses are empty. No signs of life for miles. Overturned vehicles are everywhere. French soldiers ambushed and killed are often heard of. In the suburbs of Saigon, many houses have also become scorched earth. This highway line belongs to the territory of Kien Giang Province. In the cities of Fengtian, Ruling, Fengho, and Jinggong in the province, during the early days of Japan's surrender, they were burned, killed, and plundered by British-Indian troops, followed by battles between French and Vietnamese troops. Tens of thousands of overseas Chinese are still displaced and struggling, living in uncertainty. Everyone is in danger, and the situation is extremely miserable.</p>
<p>Within half a year, I have been to Saigon three times. Although it is still wearing the cloak of a commercial port, in fact, it is like a large military camp. In the Mekong River, gunboats, transport ships, and aircraft carriers cover the harbor. In the urban area, military vehicles come and go, one after another. Tanks and armored vehicles often appear for demonstrations. Airplanes also circle in the air from time to time. French soldiers rampage, appearing to see themselves as conquerors. The Saigon urban area is vast, and the commercial area is most developed in Dike, six miles away. With 200,000 overseas Chinese, Dike is a purely overseas Chinese commercial district. However, with harsh regulations and the French implementing economic monopoly policies, the market is greatly affected. However, at the same time, overseas Chinese spent 30 million Vietnamese dong to build a New Jinshan Entertainment Center, which has the largest dance hall in the Far East, and a casino comparable to Monte Carlo in the East, Macau. Opium dens are lined up, and brothels are everywhere. Decadence and shamelessness, imperialists have always been the best at using these to numb the people of the colonies.</p>
<p>Many important agencies of the National Government in Vietnam are located in Saigon; after the establishment of the "Southern Republic Provisional Government," it was also made the capital. Since the French-Vietnamese situation became urgent, French Colonial Minister Moutet, Far East Army Commander Hua Wei, and Resident Commissioner of Vietnam, Darshan Lian, successively arrived in Saigon. He then issued an order that every night from 10:00 PM to 7:00 AM the next morning was curfew time. During the curfew, there were no pedestrians on the streets. Residents were often broken into by armed personnel, who committed rape, robbery, and did everything possible. The greatest sufferers were our overseas Chinese. The Consulate General of our country in Saigon receives reports, and the case files are more than a foot thick. I once asked Consul General Yin Fengzao about this, how the negotiations were going, and whether the French side had the sincerity to prevent such incidents from happening. He simply said, "It is still not optimistic." One can also see how difficult it is to negotiate these cases.</p>
<p>During my three days in Saigon, I obtained the consent of the French side to take a military plane to Haiphong. According to the French officer traveling with me, the Jibi Airport, where the plane landed, was occupied by Viet Minh troops when the French-Vietnamese conflict first broke out on November 19. It was not until November 27 that Colonel Daibolié led parachute troops, along with fighter squadrons and ground armored regiments, to participate in the battle before it was regained by the French army. Shell casings were all over the ground, and the hangars were covered with bullet holes, which gave a glimpse of the intensity of the fighting at that time.</p>
<p>In every street in the urban area and along the Mekong River, French troops installed gun emplacements everywhere, holding their ground. French warships also removed their gun covers and aimed at the urban area. Most of the important buildings were damaged, and most of the civilian houses were destroyed. Everywhere there were broken walls and remnants of fire that had not been extinguished. There was not a single pedestrian to be seen, only tanks patrolling back and forth. The Yongdian Power Plant has not yet been repaired. At night, the entire city is plunged into darkness. Viet Minh troops constantly concentrated artillery fire on the urban area, and Viet Minh troops lurking in the urban area set fires and fired guns everywhere in response. The atmosphere of terror was chilling.</p>
<p>Brief Stay in Haiphong</p>
<p>After the conflict, the Viet Minh Committee issued a declaration calling on the Vietnamese people to be calm, united, and quickly make effective preparations. Vietnamese newspapers also severely criticized Darshan Lian. The "Minzu" newspaper said, "He is the destroyer of French-Vietnamese national unity." The conclusion stated, "If Darshan Lian returns to Vietnam, the blood of the Vietnamese people will undoubtedly flow again."</p>
<p>According to official statistics, the losses of overseas Chinese were: 59 dead, 51 injured, 193 arrested, and 502 missing. Property losses: 23 houses were completely destroyed, 59 were partially destroyed, plus the total value of goods and other losses was 25 million Vietnamese dong. However, based on observations, the losses of life and property are probably not limited to this.</p>
<p>Haiphong originally had 80,000 overseas Chinese, and more than 2,000 people from neighboring areas gathered in Haiphong. Everyone was anxiously like ants on a hot pot. Leaving or staying were both impossible, and they lived in uncertainty. The suffering, stained with blood, is really beyond the imagination of those who have not experienced it!</p>
<p>During my two days in Haiphong, I managed to obtain a pass from the Viet Minh side. In the dim morning, I entered the defense area of the Viet Minh army. Because they had been notified in advance, as soon as I arrived, five Vietnamese youths, three men and two women, armed with weapons, escorted me deep into the interior.</p>
<p>The railways and highways have been destroyed. Residents along the line are stepping up the construction of fortifications and also intensifying evacuations. I saw with my own eyes that they even sacrificed their only beds, door panels, and even the carts that the carters regarded as their only property, to be used as obstacles. The emotions were tragic and passionate, moving and worthy of song, which was touching.</p>

<h3>An Overlooked Gynecological Disease: The Truth About Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>— Cheng Yanjia</p>
<p>Speaking of leukorrhea, most people think it is something women should have, especially married women, nine out of ten have it, so there is no need to worry about it. Others think that leukorrhea is a very common gynecological disease, and there is no need to consult a doctor, just use the medicine introduced by friends or advertised on the advertisement to get a quick cure. In fact, both of these views are wrong. Leukorrhea is a white secretion flowing out of the cervix and vagina. This secretion is sometimes just a physiological phenomenon, such as in the premenstrual period or during pregnancy, due to hormonal imbalance or increased physiological function, the secretion also increases. But in many cases, leukorrhea is a pathological phenomenon. Leukorrhea itself cannot be called a disease, but it is a symptom of many gynecological diseases. Now let's talk about several common diseases that increase leukorrhea. (This article is limited to the vagina and cervix) Before we talk about it, we should first know the physiological structure of the vagina and cervix.</p>
<p>The surface of the vagina has a layer of mucous membrane, which is similar to the skin and is composed of stratified squamous cells. There are no glands in the vagina, so its secretions actually come from the cervix and uterus. During the period when the ovary is active - from puberty to menopause - the chemical reaction in the vagina is weakly acidic (PH4-5.5). This weak acidity is due to a type of acid-producing bacteria called Doderlein's Bacillus, which ferments liver starch in vaginal epidermal cells to produce lactic acid. The degree of acidity is sufficient to prevent the growth and reproduction of general bacteria, because general bacteria are not suitable for survival in acidic environments, so maintaining an acidity of PH4-5.5 is very important. So how can we continuously maintain weak acidity? Originally, the amount of lactic acid depends on the amount of liver starch in the epidermal cells, and the amount of liver starch in the epidermal cells depends on the activity of estrogen in the ovaries. Therefore, before puberty and after menopause, estrogen decreases, liver starch also decreases, and the vaginal reaction changes from weakly acidic to alkaline. During this period, if external bacteria invade the vagina, it is easy to cause inflammation.</p>
<p>The cervix is like a strait, it connects the vagina and the uterus. The mucous membrane near the vagina is still composed of stratified squamous cells, but the mucous membrane in the tube is composed of a single layer of tubular cells. The cervix has many glands, and the ducts open to the surface, so it can discharge secretions into the vagina. This secretion is a colorless, alkaline mucus, which usually blocks the cervical canal, so things in the vagina are not easy to invade the uterine cavity.</p>
<p>After understanding the physiological structure of the vagina and cervix, we can separately talk about several main diseases that increase leukorrhea.</p>
<p>(1) Vulvovaginitis</p>
<p>Leukorrhea in girls before puberty is mostly pathological. The reason is that gonorrhea or pyogenic bacteria are transmitted into the vagina. The transmission methods are nothing more than direct contact with contaminated clothes, bathing, etc., or due to finger transmission, or even due to improper sexual behavior. The symptoms are red vulva, and sticky purulent leukorrhea flows out of the hymen and vagina. If the secretions are examined under a microscope or cultured, the exact type of bacteria can be known. The treatment methods are nothing more than chemical therapy such as Neosalvarsan or penicillin, local irrigation, and injection of estrogen. As for the principle of using endocrine treatment, it has been mentioned in the above physiological section that it is to enhance the production of lactic acid and thicken the vaginal epidermal cells, which can strengthen the resistance to bacteria. The treatment results are mostly satisfactory.</p>
<p>(2) Senile Vaginitis</p>
<p>Senile vaginitis, as the name suggests, of course occurs in elderly women. It usually occurs after menopause, the activity of the ovaries decreases, estrogen gradually stops, and the mucous membrane in the vagina also degenerates, and the epidermis thins. Therefore, not only is the resistance to external bacteria weak in terms of tissue, but also the chemical reaction secreted in the vagina becomes alkaline due to the decrease in estrogen and the sharp decrease in lactic acid production. As a result, bacteria multiply and cause inflammation. The symptoms are diffuse redness and swelling of the vagina and a large increase in leukorrhea, but it is seropurulent. The treatment method is to locally irrigate with warm water or mild disinfectant, and at the same time inject estrogen. The principle is similar to the treatment of childhood vaginitis, so the results are very significantly effective.</p>
<p>(3) Trichomonas Vaginalis</p>
<p>During the reproductive period of women, due to the activity of estrogen, it is not easy to get vaginitis except for a disease called trichomoniasis. So what is trichomonas? Trichomonas is a flagellate protozoan, which can be seen under a microscope, shaped like a pear, with hairs on the outer circle, and abnormally active. The transmission method is direct contact with contaminated objects or sexual intercourse. The symptom is a large increase in leukorrhea, light yellow in color, and foamy. If you take a drop of leukorrhea and dilute it in salt water and examine it under a microscope, you can immediately see trichomonas. This kind of leukorrhea is very irritating to the skin, causing the patient to feel itchy and restless day and night. Treatment methods (1) Use a powder sprayer to spray anti-trichomonas drugs such as silver compounds, arsenic compounds, or Vioform powder on the vaginal mucosa, and at the same time insert the same type of suppositories into the deep part of the vagina every day. (2) Irrigate the vagina with lactic acid every day, and then insert acid-producing suppositories into the deep part of the vagina to maintain the acidic reaction of the vagina, because trichomonas is also not easy to grow in acidic environments. The treatment results are uncertain. Some patients can easily be completely cured, but some patients often relapse, so the treatment should not be interrupted.</p>
<p>(4) Simple Vaginitis</p>
<p>This kind of inflammation is mostly because the vaginal mucosa is irritated, such as long-term use of uterine pessaries or local use of strong drugs. Generally, ignorant women sometimes want to have an abortion after pregnancy, so they put all kinds of drugs or irritants into the vagina. Sometimes, the medicated water used for vaginal douching is too strong, causing damage to the mucosa. The symptoms are milky white discharge, many of which have a foul smell, and the vaginal mucosa is even ulcerated. Because there are putrefactive bacteria present, the patient feels dryness and itching in the private parts, etc. The most important treatment method is to remove the source of the disease, and then irrigate the vagina with a mild disinfectant. The result is good.</p>
<p>(5) Acute Cervicitis</p>
<p>The cause of acute inflammation of the cervix is nothing more than the invasion of gonorrhea and the deepening of pyogenic bacteria into the wound after the cervix is torn during childbirth or abortion. The mucous membrane of the cervix reacts and eventually becomes inflamed.</p>
<p>The symptoms are increased leukorrhea, yellow and tough, painful urination, frequent urination, bleeding from the cervix and erosion, so diagnosis is easy. As for determining what kind of bacteria is the source of the disease, just examine the leukorrhea under a microscope or culture it to know. Treatment methods include chemical therapy and preventing excessive fatigue such as dancing and long-distance walking. The results of early treatment are satisfactory. If it is ignored and not treated, then the inflammation is easy to spread to the uterus and fallopian tubes.</p>
<p>Chronic cervicitis is a very common gynecological disease. Usually, as long as there is increased leukorrhea and the cervix is ruptured or eroded, it can be diagnosed as chronic cervicitis. However, recently, gynecological experts have examined it in detail, cultured the leukorrhea, and examined the tissue sections of the cervix under a microscope, and could not find any bacteria present. So many so-called chronic cervicitis are not formal inflammation. This phenomenon is mostly because the cervix is injured after childbirth. At that time, bacteria may have invaded, but it healed quickly. However, the secretory glands of the cervix are overgrown and the secretion increases, but the nature is not purulent but mucoid. At the same time, the patient has a feeling of falling and back pain, etc. The purpose of treatment is not to eliminate bacteria, but to destroy or reduce the overgrown cervical glands. Therefore, the secretion can also be reduced. Treatment methods: (1) Use electrocoagulation to necrose the overgrown glands of the cervix and cervical canal; (2) Use zinc chloride to electrolyze and chemically burn the cervix and cervical canal; (3) If the cervical laceration is very severe, then the wound should be sutured or cervical amputation should be performed.</p>
<p>(7) Cervical Cancer</p>
<p>The source of cervical cancer is controversial, and its true cause cannot be determined at present, but local chronic irritation is generally considered to be a factor. Cancerous tissue grows from the squamous cells of the cervix, or from the columnar cells of the cervical canal or glands. According to statistics, cervical cancer is the most common female cancer. Usually women between the ages of forty and fifty are most likely to get cervical cancer; but people in their twenties and sixties can also get it. The symptoms in the early stage are only a small amount of watery leukorrhea, and occasionally there is blood in the leukorrhea, especially after contact. Unfortunately, patients often neglect to seek medical treatment at this stage. In the second and third stages, there is a large amount of leukorrhea, yellow glandular discharge with a foul odor, which is because the cancer grows and there is necrosis, rot and infection. At the same time, there is a lot of bleeding. In the fourth stage, the growth of the cancer spreads into the pelvic connective tissue, nerves, and bladder or rectum, so there are abdominal pain, leg pain, back pain, constipation, painful urination with blood, and significant weight loss. In the early stage, the diagnosis of cancer is not easy, because the symptoms are not obvious, unless a biopsy of the cervical tissue is examined under a microscope to determine.</p>
<p>There are two treatment methods: (1) Perform surgery and add radiation - first perform surgery to completely remove the cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries and pelvic connective tissue, and then use radium needles and deep X-ray irradiation. This method can only be applied to first-stage patients. The so-called first stage is that the growth of cancer is limited to the cervix itself; (2) Do not perform surgery, but only use radium needles and deep X-ray irradiation. Recently, radiation therapy has been gradually improved, so the treatment results are very good, because this method is not limited to first-stage patients. According to a 1938 report from sixteen radiation treatment centers, using five years without recurrence as the standard, an average of twenty-seven out of one hundred cervical cancer patients (ranging from first to fourth stage) can live for five years without recurrence after radiation treatment. If it is divided into stages, then 57% of first-stage patients do not recur within five years. Only 5.5% of fourth-stage patients do not recur within five years. It can be seen that the prognosis of the same cervical cancer is very different between the first and fourth stages, so early diagnosis and early treatment are so important.</p>
<p>There are many other causes of leukorrhea, such as cancer of the vagina and vulva, uterine cavity diseases, etc. Due to space limitations, I can only mention them briefly here. In short, the increase in leukorrhea is sometimes just a mild inflammation, but sometimes it may be a sign of some serious diseases. Therefore, we should correct the past erroneous concept of ignoring leukorrhea. I advise all female compatriots that when you find leukorrhea, it is best to see a doctor for a check-up immediately. If it is mild inflammation, it can certainly be cured immediately; even if it is the most terrible cervical cancer, early treatment can also achieve good results in more than half of the cases. But do not cause serious consequences due to being too lazy to check, or delay the opportunity for treatment due to a fluke mentality. Qiao Shumin</p>

<h3>Sex and Mental Illness</h3>
<p>— Zhu Hanying</p>
<p>Whether in China or Europe and the United States, in the past, knowledge about "sex" was viewed from a religious or moral standpoint, and was considered obscene and shameful for noble people to ask about. Therefore, for thousands of years, we have been forbidden to know knowledge about "sex" under this erroneous traditional concept, resulting in many sexual psychological abnormalities. In the past thirty years, European and American countries have established enlightened new concepts and promoted sex education and sexual hygiene, but China is still shrouded in a strong old concept. This is what the medical and educational circles should pay attention to.</p>
<p>We know that all living things have the instinct of "reproduction". Lower organisms have "reproduction" but no "sex"; higher animals have "reproduction" and "sex" at the same time; but the sexual desire of general animals only exists during the age of reproductive capacity, while the existence of human sexual desire is not necessarily during the reproductive period. Many scholars admit that boys and girls have spontaneous sexual desire, such as infants sucking breast milk, which has a pleasant feeling, because the mouth is also one of the sensual parts in adulthood, and boys have a good feeling towards their mothers. If a third party divides his mother's love, he will be jealous. Similarly, girls also have a good feeling towards their fathers. Luo Ci made a detailed statistic that the age of the beginning of sexual feeling for boys is probably between five and fourteen years old, and the age of the beginning of sexual feeling for girls is between eight and seventeen years old.</p>
<p>After boys and girls mature physically, both parties must choose a suitable partner. Young people in the period of passionate love contain a little "madness", thus producing more or less amorous affairs. The Emperor of England and Mrs. Simpson are an example of this. This kind of state does not belong to abnormality in psychology. Then, what kind of mental abnormality does the commonly talked about "lovesickness" and "infatuation" refer to? Briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>"Lovesickness" occurs in patients with an introverted personality. He or she likes to satisfy his or her desires with contemplation and dreams. Therefore, he or she lingers in bed, enjoying his or her fantasy and hallucinatory life. It is commonly seen in patients with schizophrenia (Scleizonereuia). Patients with "infatuation" mostly have an extroverted personality. He or she often decorates his or her face, hair and clothing to make people very dazzling, likes to be close to the opposite sex, and openly expresses admiration. Sometimes he or she writes letters to strangers of the opposite sex, or falsely declares "engagement at a certain place on a certain day", etc. It is commonly seen in patients with mild mania (Hypomauia).</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the right medicine for the two diseases is "marriage". In fact, a psychologically healthy person will not develop mental illness no matter how great the stimulation he suffers, unless there is an innate psychological unsoundness. Therefore, marriage can only cure a very small part of the mild "lovesickness" and "infatuation" patients. This part of the patients will recover naturally even without the marriage procedure. If we adopt the past method of high abstinence, religious figures proclaim the venting of sexual desire as offending the gods, and moralists denounce it as vulgar and shameless, but the results are just the opposite. Then we abandon abstinence and adopt indulgence, but sexual desire is not appetite. The solution requires a partner, so under laissez-faire, many actions of infringing on others will inevitably be staged, resulting in various events that violate the law. The only method is to start instilling sex education from childhood. The most appropriate person to fulfill this responsibility is none other than the mother. The most common curiosity of children is to understand the differences in the physical structure of men and women. They must be answered naturally. It is to take the method of co-bathing with parents and children from childhood, so that morbid curiosity can be avoided. At the same time, pay attention to sexual hygiene, such as having a regular life, mainly vegetarian food, cold baths, no extravagance, avoiding all strong physical and mental stimulation, being careful in making friends, working diligently, and doing more exercise. This can prevent children with "psychopathic" to develop sexual mental illness in adulthood.</p>
<h3>New Knowledge in the Medical World</h3>
<p>— Qiao Shumin</p>
<p>Oral Plasma Liquid for Newborns</p>
<p>Looking at modern medical literature, among the problems of many newborns, especially those with congenital deficiencies or premature infants, there is a very important and difficult problem to solve, which is the weight loss after birth, and even after many days, they cannot restore to the weight at birth.</p>
<p>Various new feeding recipes, such as high protein content, are also helpful, but they are not satisfactory.</p>
<p>Transfusing the mother's placental blood to the infant through the umbilical cord can indeed prevent the weight loss after birth, but the procedure is quite difficult and cannot be easily done under normal circumstances.</p>
<p>We know that the nature of plasma is very similar to colostrum. Its protein can penetrate the intestinal wall of the infant and be absorbed. Feeding infants with it can indeed prevent the weight loss after birth.</p>
<p>According to a report by Dr. John F. Loehle, he used plasma liquid to feed seven premature infants, and their weight did not decrease at all, but once the plasma was stopped, the weight decreased.</p>
<p>He also made a feeding experiment on twins: the older one was breastfed by the mother; the younger one was only fed sugar water, and within 24 hours, he gasped and had fever. Oxygen was used to treat him for a total of 16 hours, but it was still ineffective. Then he was given plasma liquid, and the situation improved greatly within an hour. After that, he continued to feed plasma liquid and breast milk, and later he overtook his brother in weight. Dr. Luo Er was interesting, he stopped feeding the younger one plasma liquid and switched to feeding the older one. In a few days, the older one was in the lead.</p>
<p>In addition, he also tested two other pairs of twins and four other premature infants, and the results were remarkable. What is noteworthy is that there is usually vomiting with general artificial feeding, but after taking plasma liquid, vomiting stops. It can be seen that plasma liquid itself does not have the side effect of irritating the gastric mucosa, and may have an anti-vomiting effect. The future infant feeding method will be improved, or it will be based on protein containing high amounts of plasma.</p>
<p>What should be the dose of feeding plasma liquid? According to Dr. Luo Er's experience, the usual dose is 10 cc (c.c.) per kilogram of body weight, orally every two hours. If the weight does not decrease or even increases after 24 hours, then give it orally every two and a half hours, for two consecutive days, and then change it to once every three hours as appropriate.</p>
<p>Dr. Luo Er used human plasma. (Original article published in J. Pediat 28:145, 1948) In my opinion, can pig plasma and cow plasma also be used? Please ask domestic pediatricians to try it. I am inconvenienced in my travels.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion of Venereal Diseases</h3>
<p>— Dong Baoji</p>
<p>Venereal disease is a byproduct of failed sexual encounters for humanity. It possesses a subtle yet formidable contagiousness, and a gradual, progressive destructiveness. Its primary source is sexual intercourse, hence it is commonly known as sexually transmitted diseases, or venereal diseases. However, infection from other sources occasionally occurs as well.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, venereal diseases include five types: syphilis, gonorrhea, chancroid, granuloma venereum, and granuloma inguinale. Some also include condyloma acuminata (genital warts). Among them, syphilis and gonorrhea are the most important. Syphilis is more serious, while gonorrhea is more prevalent, almost five or six times more common than syphilis. The other types are mostly localized, with less impact on the entire body. Granuloma inguinale is more common in tropical regions. Although it cannot be said to be absolutely nonexistent in China, actual cases are rare.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea – After contracting the disease, the initial sensation is irritation of the genitals, followed by a discharge of white secretions, commonly known as "white turbidity" or "leukorrhea." Afterwards, the patient experiences pain during urination, with increased frequency. After several weeks, the symptoms gradually disappear. This phenomenon does not mean that the disease has healed itself. In fact, acute symptoms may reappear at any time. With repeated infections, the body's response causes the affected area to develop a significant amount of fibrous tissue, similar to scar tissue. As a result, men may experience urinary obstruction, requiring the use of instruments to forcibly clear the urethra several times a year for the rest of their lives. In women, the fallopian tubes may become blocked, resulting in permanent infertility. Sometimes, the bacteria may spread through the bloodstream to the joints, causing arthritis, or to the heart, causing serious heart disease.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea bacteria can be found in the secretions of the patient's genitals. Their transmission can be broadly classified into four types: (1) direct transmission through sexual intercourse, (2) transfer of secretions from the hands to the eyes, causing blindness, (3) transmission to the genitals of young children from unclean cloths or washing utensils, and (4) infection of infants during childbirth through contact with the infected birth canal. Transmission through toilets, cups, or chopsticks is usually less likely, as these bacteria die quickly in dry and cold environments.</p>
<p>Due to differences in physical constitution, the suffering experienced by men is more immediate and apparent than that experienced by women. As a result, women often do not pay attention to or seek treatment after contracting the disease. Some women, even knowing that they have gonorrhea, deliberately ignore it because they are not currently suffering from its effects. These women are dangerous sources of infection.</p>
<p>Syphilis has existed in China for over four hundred years. Initially, it was limited to coastal port areas and was relatively rare. Now, it is very common even in remote inland areas. This is a dangerous phenomenon. The progress of syphilis medicine is only about forty years old (since the discovery of the syphilis spirochete). The invention of Salvarsan ("606") in 1902 and the recent advances in chemotherapy have provided the tools to vigorously pursue prevention and treatment.</p>
<p>The initial symptom of syphilis is a painless, indurated chancre. It usually appears on the external genitals in areas prone to injury, and can be detected about four weeks after infection. This is commonly called a "hard chancre." The chancre will heal on its own after five or six weeks. The following one to two years mark the secondary stage of syphilis. During this stage, the syphilis bacteria are carried by the bloodstream to various lymph nodes, causing swollen lymph nodes, a skin rash (syphilitic roseola), sore throat, bone pain, etc. These symptoms can be mild or severe and may disappear on their own. However, the disease gradually enters the tertiary stage in five to twenty-five years. The syphilis bacteria spread from the lymph nodes to internal organs, the aorta, heart, liver, bones, nerves, and brain. The symptoms vary depending on where the bacteria concentrate and cause damage, leading to heart pain, heart failure, blindness, dementia, neurological disorders, etc.</p>
<p>Syphilis is usually transmitted directly through sexual intercourse. However, doctors or nurses may occasionally become infected through accidental contact with patients. Infected mothers, unless properly treated, can easily transmit the disease to their fetuses. Such infants, if left untreated, may survive for ten or twenty years, but they are often intellectually impaired or crippled.</p>
<p>Salvarsan ("606") can cure syphilis, but only in its early, secondary stages. And it can only be effective with proper medical treatment. The earlier the treatment, the better the outcome. Patients in the initial stages, especially women, often do not pay attention to it because they have not yet experienced pain, and they miss the opportunity for a complete cure. Furthermore, some patients have a superficial understanding and self-medicate, or are deceived by quack doctors, receiving only partial treatment. Although the immediate suffering may subside temporarily, the disease will recur later in a more severe form, causing great harm. Doctors often use blood tests to detect latent syphilis. However, this does not mean that blood tests can definitely confirm its presence, as the sensitivity of these tests is only about 85%. In other words, only 85 out of 100 true syphilis patients can be identified through blood tests. In the earliest stages (before six weeks after infection), or in the latest stages (a portion of the tertiary stage), or after partial treatment, the blood serum syphilis reaction (Wassermann or Kahn test) is often negative.</p>
<p>From the above points, we can see that venereal disease is truly a terrible tragedy. The only sure way to prevent it is to avoid sexual contact with infected individuals, especially illicit sexual encounters. Of course, illicit sexual encounters and venereal disease transmission are not necessarily directly related. However, prostitutes, because of their numerous clients, have a much higher chance of contracting the disease than ordinary people. Private prostitutes are almost more likely to be infected than licensed prostitutes. These are all facts.</p>
<p>Using a rubber condom or topical antiseptic (ordinary soap and hot water are sufficient to kill external bacteria), or taking oral or injectable prophylactic bactericides, before sexual intercourse with a woman with venereal disease can reduce the chances of infection significantly, but it is not absolutely certain. Syphilitic ulcers can still appear on areas outside the condom. Moreover, men often use them improperly when drunk. Antiseptics can temporarily suppress the initial symptoms, but they often allow the bacteria to penetrate deeper, causing more serious problems later. The use of such methods in the military is understandable due to the extraordinary circumstances, but it is definitely not suitable or safe for the general public.</p>
<p>Other important points to note are early and complete treatment. If patients can eliminate their infectivity during the later stages, then the chances of infecting others can be greatly reduced. This includes how to encourage patients to see a doctor, how doctors can provide complete treatment, and how to ensure that patients continue to complete a rational and complete course of treatment. Everything is related to psychology, technology, and education.</p>
<p>Now let us examine how to deal with venereal disease? Promiscuity and drunkenness are the main contributing factors. Education and welfare initiatives are far better than any preventive measure. The licensed prostitution system has often failed in countries around the world, because the tighter the management of prostitutes, the more afraid they are of losing their jobs due to illness, and they become private prostitutes instead. Furthermore, doctors only examine prostitutes three times a month, which takes very little time. A certificate proving that they are disease-free cannot completely guarantee that they do not have venereal disease. This is an academic problem. Unless there is good control over the population registry, legal regulations for patients who violate treatment protocols to supplement the deficiencies of education, and appropriate medical personnel providing complete treatment, along with daily disinfection and prevention, the chances of transmission can be reduced. The same applies to patients among the general population.</p>
<p>In conclusion, venereal disease is recognized as dangerous, and everyone needs to recognize the seriousness of venereal disease transmission. They must control their own intellect and identify their goals, and not seek pleasure and contract the disease. If this is not possible, then they should choose their partner carefully and use their wisdom to prevent it. Finally, if they have discovered that they have venereal disease, they need to treat it thoroughly and completely, and never harm others or delay their own treatment. Only in this way can we achieve disease prevention through treatment, and ultimately achieve ideal social hygiene.</p>

<h3>Passing the Three Barriers</h3>
<p>— Ruosi</p>
<p>After passing the Gregorian New Year barrier, we face the Lunar New Year barrier, barrier after barrier difficult to pass, making life and death a concern.</p>
<p>Chinese people have been living a dual life for about ten years, celebrating the "Foreign Winter Solstice" (Christmas) and then the Chinese Winter Solstice; taking holidays for the Gregorian New Year and also resting for the Lunar New Year, enjoying the benefits of both. This is not a big deal; but when the New Year barrier comes in duplicate, forcing people to cross the barrier twice, the financial and business sectors are crushed by the squeeze of funds, which is a bit overwhelming.</p>
<p>The other day, the Chinese Theater performed the complete "Red Mane Steed." Xue Pinggui had passed two barriers but was still not out of danger. Only after running to the third barrier did he dare to turn around and sing a duet with Princess Daizhan, who was as urgent as a "top-speed rickshaw."</p>
<p>Shanghai is no different. The term "squeezing through" the New Year barrier, with the word "squeezing" used, shows how rushed, urgent, and desperate it is.</p>
<p>I hope everyone can squeeze through steadily, at least not getting overturned. If you get overturned in the first or second barrier, you won't be able to run to the third barrier, and where will you get the status to sing a duet with Princess Daizhan? Not to mention a grand reunion at the Dengdian ceremony.</p>

<p>The "World Almanac" sells 600,000 copies annually. The 1947 edition was published in the first week of January. The editor is Eastman Irwin, a tall, white-haired, green-eyed journalist. He takes on this most burdensome job in the United States, and it cannot be neglected in the slightest. In the thousands of pieces of information collected in the almanac each year, even the smallest error will anger scholars everywhere, causing many questions and criticisms.</p>
<p>In the libraries of major cities around the world, the "World Almanac" is used so frequently that the corners of the book are curled, stained, and torn. Two or three copies need to be replaced each year. Sometimes, a page or two are torn out to prove a certain fact, resulting in incomplete copies.</p>
<p>Not only do libraries need to purchase a copy of the "World Almanac," but businessmen, teachers, students, writers, lawyers, and civil servants also need one in hand. Editors feel that their desks are incomplete without this almanac.</p>
<p>The "World Almanac" is sold all over the world. Peking University in China also has past editions of the almanac from before the war. Since 1885, old almanacs have often been consulted in courts to resolve certain issues, such as which day the tide was highest or the moon was fullest in a certain month of a certain year.</p>
<p>In addition to regular statistics on population, elections, sports, commerce, etc., the almanac also gathers world news and anecdotes. Want to know which internal organ of the human body is the heaviest, the liver or the brain? Just check the "World Almanac." The liver weighs 1600 grams, and the brain weighs 1400 grams. How many horses and donkeys are there in the United States? In 1945, there were a total of 12,305,000, a decrease of four million in ten years. How many calories does a woman need each day? 2500 calories. How many bacteria are there on a fly? Six million. The brightest lighthouse in the United States is in Navesink, New Jersey, with a luminosity of 9 million candlepower.</p>
<p>The almanac also includes various records, such as the price of ham before 1900, which state is the main producer of whetstones and oilstones, how to identify counterfeit currency, the total length of streets and roads in the United States, the total number of stillbirths in New York City, what day of the week was July 4, 1776, and what is the appropriate gift to celebrate a second wedding anniversary.</p>
<p>Do you want to test how long it takes to reach the ground by jumping off the Royal Building? Just look up the speed of falling objects. The answer is nine seconds.</p>
<p>Irwin is often asked strange questions on the radio. As soon as one answer is given, another question comes up. The inquiring phone calls drive him crazy. One housewife asked him how long the blood vessels in the human body are. He shouted madly, "Madam, they are 100,000 miles long!"</p>
<p>During the war, the "World Almanac" was sent to lonely American soldiers in the farthest corners of the world. They often corresponded with Irwin and asked questions. Once, two American soldiers in the South Pacific argued about which city, New York or Chicago, had the longest public transportation line. Later, Irwin proved that New York was in first place when all the streetcars, buses, and elevators were included.</p>
<p>The "World Almanac" is published by the World Telegram, and it is now in its 61st year. In the first 20 years, it gradually developed to annual sales of 300,000 copies. In 1937, Irwin took over as editor and greatly improved it, emphasizing entertainment and timeliness, deleting unnecessary text, and adding information on food, nutrition, and science.</p>
<p>Every year in May and June, the "World Almanac" editorial office sends letters to authorities and experts in all fields around the world, soliciting materials. Recipients include mayors, government officials, principals, chambers of commerce, and other organizations that can collect data. The FBI, the Department of Commerce, and the Army and Navy all help him.</p>
<p>Irwin has no fixed standard for selecting materials, relying entirely on his experience to decide. As a result of his efforts, sales have doubled.</p>
<h3>A Lama Discusses Tibet</h3>
<p>— Pan Chenglie</p>
<p>Qinghua University invited an alumnus who graduated from the school ten years ago and is now a lama to give a lecture on the afternoon of January 10. Because he has lived with Tibetans for eight years, what he has seen in Tibet is more than what we generally know and more accurate.</p>
<p>This lama is named Suonan Jiacuo. He also has a Chinese name. The most striking thing is his unique clothing: a dark red woolen monk's robe, with a long red woolen belt tied around his waist, dragging to his feet. The front of the robe is woven with brocade, but the sleeves are so short that they almost slip off. In such cold weather, his arms are still completely exposed. Outside, he wears a dark red woolen cloth, twelve feet long, wrapping his body, but his right hand is always often exposed. These fabrics are all Tibetan-made.</p>
<p>Although the clothing is so strange, he speaks very pure Beijing dialect.</p>
<p>Still holding a string of black and white prayer beads in his hand, he began his introduction to "The Current Situation in Tibet."</p>
<p>The living Buddhas of Lamaism, which the Tibetans believe in, are not completely the same as the "Buddhas" in Buddhism. Lamas with high morals and scholarship can become living Buddhas. Therefore, there are many living Buddhas. Sometimes there is one in a small monastery, and large monasteries often have dozens of them. Believers who believe in the karma of the three lives have absolute faith in the reincarnation of living Buddhas; when a living Buddha dies, his many disciples beg him to come to this place again in the next life to guide them and continue the unfinished business of his current life. The living Buddha agrees, and sometimes tells his disciples which family or which place he will be reincarnated into in the next life. So the disciples go to look for infants born within forty-nine days of his death, believing that this must be the reincarnation of the living Buddha; but sometimes there is only one such infant. They then use various methods to test which one is the true living Buddha: such as asking the child to identify the utensils used by the living Buddha in his previous life, or observing the child's appearance and intelligence. When he reaches the age where he can leave his family, he is taken back to the temple to do the unfinished work of his previous life. In this situation, the number of living Buddhas will never decrease due to death, but only increase, so there are more and more living Buddhas there.</p>
<p>The lives of Tibetans are very simple. They only have one sheepskin garment throughout the year. Five sheepskins can make a garment; but because it is too long, they tie it around their waist with a belt, lifting up the part that is dragging down. The part above the belt is so wide that it becomes a bag, and they put commonly used items such as rice bowls inside. In hot weather, their arms are exposed; in cold weather, they wrap them up with their clothes. At night, they take off their clothes and spread them on the ground, and people sleep on them, so that half of it serves as a mattress and half as a blanket.</p>
<p>When eating, they use their hands and have no chopsticks. The bowl is made of wood. When eating, they first fill it with tea, pour a layer of butter on top, blow the oil aside first, drink the tea below, then pour in the ground naked barley flour, mix it with the remaining oil, mix it with water, and knead it into small cakes to eat.</p>
<p>They often offer decades of savings to the living Buddha, whom they regard as a god, and the living Buddha simply touches their heads, and that is it. Everyone has very little property, and it is clearly divided, such as which bowl belongs to the husband and which pot belongs to the wife. People collect all their property and give it to private individuals or everyone, or offer it to the living Buddha.</p>
<p>The marriage system is mostly monogamous, but there are also polygynous and polyandrous marriages. Polygyny is probably practiced by rich people, who live separately with their several wives. Polyandry is practiced by several brothers who marry one wife together to avoid many inconveniences when dividing the family property. When children are born, people do not value who the child's father is, so there is no dispute between them about whether the child was born to the eldest brother or the second brother.</p>
<p>In politics, Tibet rarely accepts the jurisdiction of the central government. When Britain wanted to extend its sphere of influence here, the Tibetans often used the protection of the central government to reject British demands, and sometimes used it in the opposite way. It is said that, from the Tibetan point of view, they also have unavoidable difficulties!</p>
<p>How can we establish a deeper connection between Tibet and the central government? Relying solely on transportation, political, or military power is not enough. In addition to starting with these simultaneously, the most important thing is to communicate their culture. There is now a Lama school on the border of Qinghai, and the funds are allocated by the state. This can be said to be one of the works of communicating culture.</p>

<h3>Beggars Welcoming the Spring (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>Sending New Year's Gifts</p>
<p>Beggars in the local gang have a heroic act of giving gifts during New Year's Eve. They carry a yellow basket, containing an empty red paper envelope and a tuft of chicken feathers, pretending to send New Year's gifts. Fortunately, no one will accept their "generous gifts," but the "foot money" has to be given. The beggars honestly and impolitely state it in their songs. It is truly humorous. The lyrics say:</p>
<p>"Coming, coming, sending gifts to celebrate the New Year!"</p>
<p>One wild chicken, a package of soup fruit.</p>
<p>Although there are few gifts, they reach every household!</p>
<p>Accept nothing, just give some pocket money and run.</p>
<p>The east family opens a golden hand,</p>
<p>Business will be good all year round."</p>
<p>Playing the Mud God</p>
<p>The beggar holds a broken bowl in his left hand, full of mud. With a small firewood stick in his right hand, he begs for money by playing the mud god, singing as he dances:</p>
<p>"The mud god arrives, business is good.</p>
<p>Good luck comes, earn silver ingots.</p>
<p>The mud god touches, the business is booming.</p>
<p>(When singing, smear a little mud on the forehead.)</p>
<p>The mud god jumps, business in the real shop is even better. (Make a jumping gesture.)</p>
<p>Today, beg for some fortune money,</p>
<p>Respectfully celebrate the New Year for the shop."</p>
<p>Sweeping the Foreigner</p>
<p>This is a long New Year's song of local beggars, flattering to the extreme. They hold a flower broom and wear a straw ring on their heads. They run to people's doors in strange costumes and sing. Although the song is vulgar, it is excessively flattering. However, everything is carefully considered, and in the words and lines, one can experience the thoughts of a talented man of the Jianghu during the late Qing Dynasty. The lyrics say:</p>
<p>(1) "Sweeping the foreigner, not sweeping for many years.</p>
<p>The Qianlong Emperor gave me Lu Axiao,</p>
<p>Telling me to go everywhere."</p>
<p>(2) "Sweeping everywhere - sweeping into the old lady's room.</p>
<p>Building the front three halls in front, building the back three rooms in the back.</p>
<p>Building a ventilation pavilion in the middle."</p>
<p>(3) "Sweeping everywhere with a broom! Sweeping the old lady's seat.</p>
<p>Guests come and go often, and sixty-four pairs are not enough."</p>
<p>(4) "Sweeping everywhere with a broom! Sweeping to the old lady's bowl cabinet.</p>
<p>The door of the bowl cabinet rings, bringing out the four dishes for dinner.</p>
<p>Plus a bowl of spicy eggplant sauce, preserved chicken, preserved duck, and preserved pork belly."</p>
<p>(5) "Sweeping everywhere with a broom! Sweeping to the old lady's rice bridge.</p>
<p>The green dragon comes to manage the rice vat,</p>
<p>The white dragon comes to manage the wine vat,</p>
<p>The yellow dragon comes to manage the granary."</p>
<p>(6) "Sweeping everywhere with a broom, sweeping to the old lady's pigsty.</p>
<p>Raising pigs, as big as cows. Pig ears dyed, like wind bags.</p>
<p>Pig tails, like brooms."</p>
<p>(7) "Sweeping everywhere with a broom</p>
<p>Sweeping to the old lady's chicken coop.</p>
<p>Golden chickens will fight with phoenixes."</p>
<p>(8) "Sweeping everywhere with a broom</p>
<p>Sweeping to the old lady's stove cabinet.</p>
<p>The rice cooked is like steamed buns.</p>
<p>The meat cut is square.</p>
<p>The fish fried costs two fees."</p>
<p>(9) "Sweeping everywhere with a broom</p>
<p>Sweeping to the old lady's chest of drawers.</p>
<p>The first drawer opened, and the silver bills keep coming.</p>
<p>The second drawer opened, and gold and silver hit the wall."</p>
<p>(10) "Sweeping everywhere with a broom!</p>
<p>Sweeping to the old lady's cradle.</p>
<p>Kneading cotton silk in a ball, weaving cloth like cotton silk.</p>
<p>Selling it in Xiaoshan's lower street, steel coins earn nine thousand nine.</p>
<p>Selling it on the upper street, one thousand is also easy to collect.</p>
<p>Large copper coins, buying fish and meat in real bags.</p>
<p>Small steel coins buy old wine.</p>
<p>Phoenixes and wealth for tens of thousands of years."</p>
<h3>Love Savings Box</h3>
<p>— Jianhua translated from the New York Daily News</p>
<p>Dr. Firth of New York has been praised by the academic community for his contributions to sexology. His many works, such as "Studies in Sex," "Sexual Life in the Early Years of Marriage," and "The Origin and Trends of Kissing," have been widely circulated and welcomed by men and women from all walks of life. On the 24th of last month (December), the doctor and his wife held their silver wedding anniversary, with more than 200 guests attending. At this grand banquet, the doctor and his wife publicly revealed two secret things: a "love savings box" and a "love exhibition."</p>
<p>Opening the Lottery in Public</p>
<p>Since the day of their marriage, the doctor has specially made two wooden boxes, called love savings boxes. If the doctor wants to dream with his wife, he must put five US dollars into Box A; if the doctor's wife also suddenly feels the need, she must also put five US dollars into Box B; if both parties feel the same need at the same time, then each pays five dollars, indicating fairness. For more than forty years, there has never been a single interruption. On the day of their silver wedding, the doctor opened the boxes in public, receiving a total of 24,600 dollars, which shows the strong love between the couple. However, the savings in Box A were one-sixth more than those in Box B.</p>
<p>Love Letter Exhibition</p>
<p>The doctor's wife, named Macmillan, was very famous in social circles forty years ago. More than twenty young men fell under her spell, and love letters requesting marriage were sent continuously. At that time, the wife's attitude was neither close nor distant. Her heart was unknown to whom she would incline. It was not until she married the doctor that everyone understood that the doctor was the one chosen. Since the day of her marriage, the wife has received a total of more than 500 love letters. On the day of the silver wedding, a refined room was opened to display all the more than 500 love letters to the public. The handsome young men who wrote to the wife in the past are now mostly old guests with frosty temples and white eyes. When they saw their love letters, some laughed silently, and some were embarrassed. However, the doctor's wife was still innocent and frank, and hospitably entertained them, seemingly as if it had nothing to do with her heart.</p>
<p>Here and Now</p>
<h3>Convenient Handling</h3>
<p>— Wenfang</p>
<p>Recently, in Shanghai, bundles of banknotes, although printed with military patterns and sealed well, often have a few small notes running out of the large notes. This kind of trick of replacing notes is ingenious.</p>
<p>If the money passes through my hands, how can I not skim some off?</p>
<p>"Shanghai is full of gold" is not a false statement!</p>
<h3>Restoring Brightness</h3>
<p>Electricity restrictions will be lifted next month, outdoor neon lights will also be revived from April, and the "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Sense of Shame" on the top of the International Hotel can once again shine brightly.</p>
<p>Will the darkness in the dark layers of Shanghai be reduced at that time? Still need to be tested!</p>
<p>Behind the Scenes</p>
<h3>Mrs. Perón of Argentina (End)</h3>
<p>— Zuo Xi</p>
<p>A Mysterious Young Woman</p>
<p>Although the Nazis in Argentina are still conducting "underground" political activities, they have been able to resume semi-official activities under the guise of charitable causes. For example, when asked what Mrs. Perón's greatest interests are, she replied: "I am organizing women's relief associations, nurseries, orphanages, and providing clothing and medicine to relieve the poor and sick."</p>
<p>Her Leading Group</p>
<p>The best social service organizations led by Mrs. Perón are all organizations run by Germans, such as the German Charity Association, the German Women's Charity Association, the German Evangelical Association, the German Poor Relief Association, and the German State Council Association. Although these organizations are theoretically under government control, they are actually staffed by officials appointed by the Nazi High Command, led by Nazi Party members, and maintain contact with former Argentine Nazi Party members.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Perón enjoys the support of the Argentine working class. However, these workers are not independent, educated workers like those in North America. According to reports circulated by the Perón opposition during the election campaign: "These workers are assassins bought from the industrial army outside the Argentine capital, most of them carrying weapons supplied by Perón, and they receive a subsidy of ten to fifty pesos for every eight people. Food and drink are reimbursed at public expense, and they are given the impression that they can do whatever they want and will not be punished in any way."</p>
<p>Lotte in the "St. Louis Express Mail" compared the methods used by Perón and Hitler. He said that Perón's "gang" is young and poor, exactly the same stuff Hitler used to organize terrorist groups, but Perón's "initial ideological tool" is the fear and distrust of Americans that Latin Americans have harbored for years. The Peróns were the first to recognize that this anti-American sentiment could be used as a political weapon.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Perón's labor relations are handled almost entirely by his wife, and it has been rumored that Mrs. Perón may soon officially become Latin America's first female labor minister.</p>
<p>Mrs. Perón's social activities have been criticized by the opposition, but she doesn't care, or pretends not to. Talking about her social life, she said: "I have very little time to participate in social activities, and even less time to watch dramas, movies or go to concerts. I spend most of my weekends with my husband on our farm, where I am a humble housewife, cooking his favorite dishes for my husband and taking care of all the housework."</p>
<p>Active in Diplomatic Circles</p>
<p>Mrs. Perón has also made a name for herself in diplomatic circles. Recently, she attended a banquet at the American Embassy. This was the first time an Argentine president's wife had attended an embassy banquet since the rift in US-Argentine relations.</p>
<p>What is Eva Perón's motive for boldly seeking power? What are her ambitions? Perhaps some clues can be found in her remarks. Recalling her opera career before she met Perón, she said: "The greatest excitement in my life was when I played the roles of great historical women such as Queen Isabella, Catherine the Great, and Elizabeth."

<h3>Gambler</h3>
<p>— Ling Yun</p>
<p>It was getting late, and the sun had withdrawn its last feeble, withered yellow rays; the already dim sky became even darker; the north wind also chimed in, becoming even more piercing, sliding down from the valley in front, emitting a mournful trembling sound, and the earth shivered.</p>
<p>A crow circled a few times in the sky, perched blankly on a large camphor tree opposite Han Abing's house, flapping its wings and croaking a few times.</p>
<p>"Pah!" Abing spat subconsciously, turned around and walked into the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Mom, godmother! It's like a nunnery!" Abing was blinded by the smoke as soon as he stepped into the door, stamping his feet and feeling resentful.</p>
<p>"Hey! It's New Year's Eve, why are you still so angry!" His wife, choked by the smoke, with tears streaming down her face, was squatting at the stove, plucking chicken feathers.</p>
<p>It wouldn't have mattered if Abing hadn't seen it, but the sight made him even more annoyed! "With a woman like you, you can't even raise chickens properly, raising them into this shape!"</p>
<p>His wife stood up abruptly and tossed the chicken, which had only a handful of bones left, onto the stove table! She spat and said:</p>
<p>"Only a family like yours would say that! Other people have rice and wheat, but your family can't even find chaff, and you still want to eat fat chickens, you're so lucky! You might as well stay at Huang Laoqi's house all day..."</p>
<p>Abing raised his eyebrows, wanting to explode, but he had nothing to say; he shrugged his shoulders and went to the thatched cottage next door.</p>
<p>The cold, whistling wind, like a snake's tongue, slipped in from the gaps in the tiles, caressing Abing's furry cheeks, feeling strangely cold, which couldn't help but make Abing shiver, and his mind suddenly became much clearer! "Damn it, I don't know which evil spirit has been following me this year. I clearly calculated that I would jump to the Azure Dragon, but I always get the Triple White Tiger; the house flips out a One for population, but I always bet on something else; that's not even worth mentioning, but I always lose to Huang Laoqi, he's not easy to mess with; didn't I already say this morning that he wouldn't let me off the hook today, that's really damn..."</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Abing immediately felt irritable! "Really damn!" He flipped the greasy hat that was pressing on his eyebrows to the back of his head and paced around the room repeatedly.</p>
<p>Sure enough, at dinner time, Huang Laoqi sent Lin Gen to call Abing over, followed by Xiangfu, who was working in the township office. Abing's wife saw that the three people were acting suspiciously and was about to rush over to ask what was going on, but the three of them ran off in a puff of smoke.</p>
<p>At night, Abing came out of Huang Laoqi's house, and it was already the third watch; Xiangfu followed behind him; several wild dogs were barking and following closely behind; Xiangfu kept scolding the dogs, and also kept scolding Abing for not walking straight!</p>
<p>Along the way, there were a few houses with brilliant candlelight shining through the cracks in the doors; sometimes a burst of firecrackers would be set off in the dark, with sparks flying everywhere; but all of this was just a blur in Abing's eyes.</p>
<p>When he got home, Abing asked Xiangfu to wait under the eaves for a while, and he walked into the house and went to the inner room, his wife followed him in.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?"</p>
<p>"Nothing!" Abing replied, raised his buttocks and just crawled into bed.</p>
<p>His wife understood in her heart, hurriedly threw the child in her arms onto the bed, freed both hands, and grabbed Abing's arm. The child was originally sucking on the nipple, his eyes were drowsy and he was about to fall asleep, and was frightened by this, and couldn't help but cry loudly.</p>
<p>"Let go, it's none of your business."</p>
<p>"You heartless wretch! You might as well kill us mother and daughter and be done with it. Who did you mortgage this lifeline to..."</p>
<p>Abing stuffed the land deed in his hand haphazardly into his arms.</p>
<p>The woman hurriedly came to grab it, Abing took the opportunity to push her hard, the woman fell to the ground, shouting like a pig being slaughtered; but she still grabbed the corner of his clothes.</p>
<p>"Aren't you letting go!" This made Abing unable to be gentle—"Slap, slap!" Abing's strength was quite strong, and the woman's face had already been hit a few times crisply.</p>
<p>The woman didn't have much strength after all, and with such a struggle, Abing broke free and ran out.</p>
<p>"Abing! Are you dead? Why aren't you coming out soon!"</p>
<p>Xiangfu was straightening his voice and shouting outside.</p>
<p>Anecdotes of Writers</p>
<h3>Mark Twain</h3>
<p>— Bo Fu</p>
<p>There is a historical society in the United States that collects many souvenirs about writers. Among the many documents, there is an envelope that is most interesting. The addressee is clearly Mrs. Mark Twain, but a line is added next to it: "Misopened for wanting to know the contents—Clemens" (Mark Twain's original name was Samuel L. Clemens).</p>
<h3>Night Hunt</h3>
<p>— Zhang Baihuai</p>
<p>The old man couldn't help but sigh. Although memory, like a poet's fairy tale, once again led him back to the garden of youthful strength, in the most beautiful ending, he finally saw himself wearing a white raincoat in the violent wind and rain; as if with infinite emotion, he then lit his long bamboo pipe.</p>
<p>"Ah, now, there are no good hunting dogs, and no good gunmen." He said.</p>
<p>What kind of mourning and sadness is the old man's heart feeling for his past glory at this moment? The starlit summer night turned into a silent fertile land, on which, who knows what kind of harvest the imaginative young people have had?</p>
<p>Those are undoubtedly a series of brave hunting stories. People will completely believe this loyal old man, but they will also ask him with surprise why the past events of decades ago are still so fresh and intimate?</p>
<p>We have no experience at all. People who grow up by the sea only have the colors of shells in their memory; and people who grow up in the valley are used to embracing the mysterious forests and rivers.</p>
<p>The old man is proud that he sang a young song because it has extraordinary significance in his life. He is interested in rambling on, saying how he killed a fat wild boar, and accurately saying the weight of the prey and the heroic posture when he carried it home. He said how a fierce tiger dug out the eyes of a hunter and broke the arm of the strongest villager; and how he was lying in the sorghum field on a silvery moonlit night, holding his breath tightly, waiting for the prey to come...</p>
<p>"When I was young, I had so much strength!...Ah, it was so interesting!"</p>
<p>We can imagine the old man's mood. All that has already been lost forever, he must also be unusually happy, but what is regrettable is that there will still be another kind of twilight feeling hidden behind that past happiness.</p>
<p>While he was patching up the fragments of his story, I remembered a winter night. At that time, I had just arrived in this desolate valley, and I had not yet seen the day and night here; one time, looking out the black window, taking a deep breath to relieve the fatigue of the day, I suddenly heard a sharp cry like a wail from the mountain, and in the homeowner's reply, I knew that the prey had fallen into the trap they had set.</p>
<p>They had already raised torches and carried ropes up the mountain. A prey the size of a yellow dog was dragged back. In the light of the torches, sharp bayonets were thrust into the throat, and someone was holding a bowl to hold the hot fresh blood, and they unhesitatingly poured it into their stomachs like drinking tea.</p>
<p>"Can this cure some disease?"</p>
<p>"Yellow muntjac blood, the best for stomach problems!"</p>
<p>We were surprised.</p>
<p>The stars of the summer night are shining with silvery white small flower buds, like leaking from the fingers of angels. On the clay field near the stream, people's interest is moving towards another kind of fresh event. The old man said that there are man-eating orangutans in a certain mountain. When orangutans catch people, they will laugh until they faint. From here, their conversation turned to the ethereal gods of mystery and ghosts....</p>

<p>I listened to the rain all night in the small building, and a few more fallen leaves were added this morning; the wild geese did not return, and the empty steps were covered with green moss.</p>

<p>Winter Night</p>
<p>It is such a quiet night, there is not a sound around, and everything on the earth has been thrown into the arms of the god of sleep. There is a faint hook of the moon in the sky, and there are two or three gray-white clouds beside the moon, and a few not very bright stars sparsely dotted, which makes the cold night more desolate. The wind is like a thief, coming lightly, and by the time you know it, it has quietly left, leaving you with a piercing feeling.</p>
<p>Occasionally, one or two barks of dogs can be heard from afar. The barking sounds like a wail.</p>
<p>Hunger</p>
<p>Hunger is the torment of the poor, and those who are born in comfort rarely know its taste.</p>
<p>I am afraid of it, this cruel torture! My body is emaciated because of it, and my face is yellow because of it.</p>
<p>When the stomach is empty, golden flowers emerge in front of the eyes, the golden flowers flash on and off, and they are messed up. As a result, the eyes go black and nothing can be seen, only a buzzing sound can be heard in the ears. Cold sweat is coming out in spurts, and the hands and feet have lost their strength. I can't arrange for it, and they have nowhere to go.</p>
<p>Die! I have had the idea of ​​suicide more than once, but I am also looking forward to the future.....</p>
<h3>About Li Xiucheng</h3>
<p>— Bao Yu</p>
<p>Loyal King Li Xiucheng was a powerful pillar of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Because of his resourcefulness and bravery, he repeatedly made outstanding achievements. However, later the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's foundation was shaken due to various reasons. Despite his efforts, he could not reverse the decline. As a result, after the fall of Nanjing, the Loyal King was captured and killed, which many people lamented.</p>
<p>However, in the winter of the 28th year, when we were fighting guerrillas with Mr. Wang Yifan in Shuyang, northern Jiangsu, we inadvertently met a "grandson of Li Xiucheng" in the countryside (near Yangkou) while visiting residents. He was a farmer in his seventies and was a little deaf. The surname reported was Zhao, and I can't remember the name now. After we talked, he revealed to us his identity that he usually didn't want to reveal—he was the grandson of Li Xiucheng. He also said that after the Loyal King was arrested, Zeng Guofan tried his best to persuade him to work in the Xiang Army. The Loyal King never agreed, and Guofan, because he cherished his talent, couldn't bear to kill him, so he secretly sent him to the countryside in Shuyang, where he hid his name and worked as a farmer to live out his days.</p>
<p>We were very surprised to hear this. Mr. Yifan also inquired about other related situations. He said that because he was young at the time, he was not very clear. But in the end, he repeated in a firm tone: the Loyal King was not killed.</p>
<p>Later, when we returned to Xinghua, Mr. Yifan specially wrote an article and published it in a magazine there, which attracted the attention of the general public in the guerrilla area.</p>
<p>Today, seeing in the newspaper that there are battles in Shuyang, I am reminded of this incident a few years ago.</p>
<p>Everyone must want to know the truth about the death of the Loyal King, but was he really killed? Now I will make a superficial analysis:</p>
<p>In Zeng Guofan's memorial to the emperor, he narrated that after Li Xiucheng was captured, he was tightly imprisoned in a cage and escorted to Nanjing, where he was still worshiped along the way. Guofan was afraid that he would be hijacked by "bandits" on the way, so he did not send him to the capital, but "executed" him in Nanjing. (Only the general meaning is recorded from memory)</p>
<p>Such a big "major criminal" as Li Xiucheng, of course, needs to be escorted to the capital and executed after careful interrogation, but Guofan "executed" him "nearby" on the grounds of "fear of being hijacked by bandits," which seems to be suspicious; but Zeng Guofan was so loyal to the Qing court and did things so "cautiously," even if he loved Li's talent, we would never believe that he could have such great charm and dare to secretly release this "dangerous person."</p>
<p>At the same time, Li Xiucheng was the most heroic leader of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. After the fall of Nanjing, he escaped with Fu Tian, ​​prepared to fight to the end. His spirit is worthy of our admiration. If he was arrested and released, could he hide his name in a remote village and live quietly for the rest of his life? This is absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>At that time, we also suspected that this "grandson of Li Xiucheng" was probably not real. He deliberately borrowed the name of Li Xiucheng to raise his status. But such suspicion may be superfluous, because he is a rough farmer, why would he do this?</p>
<p>This old man is a descendant of Li Xiucheng, there is no doubt. But his statement that Xiucheng was "not killed" may be a kind of mental comfort.</p>
<p>I don't know if this old man is still alive now? I miss him.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 153</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Sure enough, like a thunderbolt, more than a dozen people responded in unison with "fearful emergency attack." Under the dim moonlight, Tsurumi quickly saw that on this small square, some were under the shadow of the houses, and some were at the foot of the trees. There were ten or so piles of people, large and small, fighting to the death there; one group of people were in all kinds of urgent mixed clothes, but one group was uniformly dressed in black short clothes, and even their heads and faces were covered in black; this was the formal fighting uniform of the Black Dragon Society members. In a blink of an eye, Tsurumi saw that the Black Dragon Society members outnumbered the other side by a few people.</p>
<p>"Everyone stop"! Tsurumi ran to the middle of the square and shouted loudly. He was really confused at this time. The members of the Black Dragon Society are of course warriors from Beppu, and there is no need to hesitate. So, who are these people who came here? As for the "Green Field Society," it's a completely fabricated smoke screen. According to the plan, the comrades on our side didn't have this clause of fighting in such a big way. It was just an ambush of a few hidden knives and arrows from all directions, ready to rescue a few people who went to the basement to search for seven secret letters. So, where did this group of killers jump out from? So Tsurumi planned to first find out the origin of the target, and then find a way to solve the problem.</p>
<p>But despite Tsurumi's loud shouts, neither side paid any attention. This made Tsurumi a little angry; the situation was quite embarrassing. Seeing that he had shouted a few times, but still no one paid attention, he challenged, "Tsurumi Tama is here, please teach me."</p>
<p>"Ha, fearful emergency attack"! This was a voice that fell from mid-air—a very familiar voice. Tsurumi turned his head slightly in the direction of the voice, and in just a blink of an eye, he first saw from the ground that there were two or three figures on the edge of the large building projected under the moonlight. He knew that someone was watching the battle on the roof, and listening to the voice, it seemed to be the double-dumb man. Looking up at the roof, he saw that there was indeed someone standing by the railing on the roof platform.</p>
<p>Just in this moment when Tsurumi turned his head, he suddenly heard someone shouting loudly behind him, "Hai!" This voice was wide and sandy, and also夹着some childish voice: the two words shouted were also common spoken language used by Bushido, expressing acceptance of the challenge. Then he heard the voice say, "Let you taste the means of 'Hirano Munen'"! The sound had already reached Tsurumi's side.</p>
<p>Tsurumi knew that someone from the opposing side had come out, and seeing that the momentum was very fast, he should have turned his head to fight back with his sword; but he was not flustered, but turned his body around, aimed at the figure on the roof, held the precious sword with both hands, bent down, and gave a ninety-degree bow; on the one hand, he expressed his composure and paid tribute to the figure; because he knew that there must be a guard among these three figures; on the other hand, because he had skills in kendo, he also wanted to deliberately show off in front of these people. Just as he was about to finish bowing, the sound of footsteps was already approaching, and at the same time, he heard the person coming shout "Ha!" In this shout, Tsurumi had already taken a step, flipped over, the sword light reflected the moon, a small flower, and the opponent's weapon met head-on.</p>
