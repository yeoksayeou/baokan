<h3>政府決循外交途徑　迅謀解決新疆事件　白部長奉派即前往處理</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕中央派赴新疆大員，決定爲國防部長白崇禧。十二日晨八時半，主席召見白氏時，對外蒙軍隊侵入新疆事之處理有所指示，白於謁主席後，原擬即日下午啓程，嗣以又接新疆方面之電報，須再向主席請示，因決延期，可能於十三日或十四日成行。白氏飛新疆行程已定，離京後將先飛西安，在該地略事休息，即轉蘭州，在蘭留宿一晚後飛迪化，聞在該地將有一二週逗留。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕外長王世杰·國防部長白崇禧，十二日午後於立法院臨時會議中，說明政府處理最近新疆事件態度時，咸指出我政府將先用外交和平方式，謀求事件及早解決，惟暗示國家領土主權不容變更。白崇禧並報告當局已電令西北行轅主任張治中，督該地守軍善盡守土之責。十二日立院臨時會，係因廣錄等立委建議，請外交·軍事當局蒞會說明新疆事件真相而召開，原定請張院長來會，後張院長因事未來，僅由外長王世杰等報告，王氏報告，先就內外情勢及最近經過予以分析，指出此事起因相當複雜，欲明真相，須先獲得確實情報。繼報告政府所採態度，據謂：政府已向蘇·蒙雙方提出抗議，對蘇係就蘇機掩護外蒙軍事提出抗議，認此舉係不友好行動，違背中蘇友好條約，對蒙則抗議入侵事，截至目前爲止，尚未獲得答覆。政府　此事，將一本沉着堅定態度應付，希望能循外交途徑和平解決，盼立委能信任政府。若干立案詢問是否可就此事向聯合國提出控訴，王謂：目前尚無此必要。</p>
<p>當局電令駐軍　善盡守土之職</p>
<p>白崇禧報告，強調我政府向來和平待人，此事可循外交解決，惟軍人守土有責，當局已電令張治中，飭所部善盡守土之責，蓋對方提出「收復失地」口號，而阿山區固我國之領土也。會中各立委發言殊踴躍，咸盼今後勿再採軟弱外交，會議至下午五時許散。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十二日電〕某立法院委員指出，中國與外蒙古衝突之基本原因，殆在中國與外蒙古間接壤處無分界綫，此爲外交上之「漏洞」，若分界綫不勘定，界境糾紛將層出不窮，故政府應儘速與外蒙古着手勘定分界綫。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕新疆地位重要，外交交涉繁多，必須加強機構，充實人才，始能應付，立院外交法制等委會最近審查「外部特派員公署組織條例修正草案」時，僉認新疆應改設甲級特派員公署，該案十二日晨於立院例會討論時，已予通過。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕參政會駐會委員尹述賢等，關心外蒙軍之侵入新疆，認爲爲保國家領土完整，處於人民立塲之參政會，應就此事表示態度，特向參會秘處建議，召開駐委會臨時會議，討論該項問題。秘書長邵力子則認爲可於明瞭此事真相後，再表示態度。尹氏十二日晚語記者，「在此世界動盪不安之局勢中，遽然發生此事，吾人深盼政府能愼重處理，以免影響世界和平」</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕青年黨左舜生，余家菊，十二日就新疆事件談稱：青年黨對於此事之震驚，與各界對此事震驚之情形相同，惟在有關此事之正確消息到達前，不擬有所評論。渠等僉認爲此事必受他方支持無疑，故極爲重視。</p>
<p>又民社黨蔣勻田，十二日晨抵京，對新疆問題，僅稱：在未獲得更多資料前，不欲就此事發表任何談話，惟盼此事循外交途徑進行，不能再行擴大。</p>
<h3>市參會等團體　電請政府護權</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕工業協會理事長呉蘊初，對新疆事件發表感想，謂蘇聯對新省自有其一貫之政策，以往之歷史，在在可以證明。此次事件，使人有「九一八」第二之感，自侮者人恒侮之，我人應深自警惕。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕本市工界聞悉蒙軍藉蘇機掩護進攻新疆後，至感憤慨，總工會正在草擬代電，寄呈主席及外交部，要求強硬應付，以保國權。</p>

<h3>津美軍撤退　首批已開放</h3>
<p>〔聯合社北平十二日電〕美海軍陸戰隊第一批，十二日乘卡車開拔，前往塘沽搭運輸艦返美。天津美陸戰隊司令部未宣佈若干人已開拔，但一般猜測，美陸戰隊第一師官兵一千五百人，三分之一已定十天內完全退出天津，第二三批定本月十六日與十九日乘船離華。</p>
<h3>司法院副院長　李文範昨就職</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕司法院副院長李文範，十二日上午九時正式視事，就職典禮殊簡單，先由居院長介紹與全體同人見面，繼由李致詞，說明：（一）不平等條約取消後，司法院責任益見重要。（二）憲法即實施，司法爲法治國家中心，本院工作當更見繁重，渠當秉承院長指導，與諸同人共同努力，至十時始散。</p>
<h3>立院聽取報告　疏導學潮經過　否決修正立委職代名額</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕立法院十二日晨舉行三二七次例會，孫兼院長主席，出席立委九十餘人，曾先後聽取劉克　報告九立委奉命疏導學潮經過，及武漢大學請願代表萬典武報告該校慘案真相。會中討論要案十三件，其中十件通過，重要者有衛生部組織法，公務員退休法修正案，公務員撫卹法修正案等，修正立院組織法案，則因人事及預算等原因，決議交法制委會，就如何充實立院職權一點，再爲研究。</p>
<p>關於立委職業代表名額問題，十二日立院會議中曾提出，以國防委會交議案程序不合，決議原案送還國民政府。該案今日於院中提出後，首由法制委員會委員長劉克　報告研究結果，略謂：法制委會等　命研究國防最高委會所交議之「再議立委職代名額案」是否合於複議程序，研究結果，以立委職代名額早經公布，原文所稱再議字樣，在現行法律中並無根據，如係復議，與程度不合，是否可認爲修正。繼由各立委發言，大致可分成兩派，林彬，陳洪等認，辦理選舉，時間匆促，而來文主要用意在增加名額，並非全案再議，故可以認其爲修改。呂復，劉通，陳茹立等則期期以爲不合。呂復指出，政府如有意修改本案，可由政府自行決定，再交本院修改，立院不可爲其開方便之門。至延誤時間一點，咎在政府，立院亦不能代其負責。羅鼎說明若因時間不及，儘可召開臨時會，不能成爲理由。最後就審查意見「可否認爲修正」提付表決，在塲九四人，贊成者僅二四人。該案遭否決，原案送還國府。又十二日會中，對國大代表名額分配表，亦曾加以討論，以桂·川·甘等省名額分配尚有問題，決議交憲法法規委會再爲整理。</p>
<h3>新疆國軍奮勇抵抗　北塔山業經收復　蘇標誌飛機仍不斷轟炸</h3>
<p>〔中央社迪化十二日電〕我北塔山守軍，因外蒙騎兵配合軍用汽車多輛猛烈進攻，經奮勇抵抗後，於六日一度後撤，七日晨反擊，當將北塔山收復，現雙方尚在相持中，連日作戰時，均仍有軍用機協助外蒙軍作戰。</p>
<p>〔又電〕北塔山前綫消息，七日，八日，九日，十日，續有蘇聯標誌之軍用機轟炸國軍陣地。</p>
<h3>解釋憲法之權　應屬於司法院</h3>
<p>京司法界人士表示</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕關於憲法解釋及說明之權，根據憲法第七十八條之規定，由司法院行使之，司法院以日內將設大法官九人，組織大法官會議，專司解釋憲法之權。惟國府最近又設一「憲法說明書起草委會」，此間司法界人士咸認此一機構與憲法規定似有抵觸，最短期內或將就此事發表一意見書，有所聲辯，又立院方面　國府組織憲法說明書委員會事，亦表不滿，聞憲法法規委會最近開會時，決議不參加此一工作。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕民社黨張君勱，十二日晨抵京，張此次來京，乃爲憲法說明書起草委會之開會，討論各方對憲法所引爲疑問而待解決之各點，決定起草說明書之七組人事分配，該會即將舉行。秘書長雷震現留滬，日內退返京，又張君勱抵京後，陳誠·邵力子等，均往訪，張氏並訪副主席孫科等，有所晤談。</p>
<h3>進行選舉問題</h3>
<p>孫科與張君勱會商</p>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕孫科十二日宴請張君勱，王世杰等晚餐，餐後會談。張氏至下午十二時始返　邸，承語記者，今日所談問題，大部爲選舉之進行問題，茲已決定如期舉行。張氏認爲憲法之　行，可分期實現，惟每行一條，必求其真切。張氏對新疆事件，認爲仍應循外交途徑以求得解決，又張定十四日謁見主席</p>
<h3>改良麥稻種籽　左舜生稱農部研究中</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十二日電〕左舜生十二日談農部工作稱：當前惟一目標，在「改良生產增進生產」八字。並稱：洋米大量進口後，糧食可保不致再發生恐慌，糧價自當趨跌。又左氏稱：農部目前正研究改良種籽，計研究改良之麥種達廿餘種，稻種卅餘種，俾資增產。按照不甚精確統計，我國糧食生產，在戰前抵消全國總消費量，僅缺百分之三，戰後亦不過百分之五或六，然目前僅在於運輸不　，交通工具不夠，致使有無不能調劑，而出於採購洋米，以解青黃不接之恐慌，現此時機即將過去。左氏就農長後，正埋首於研究工作及計劃業務。</p>
<h3>旅大視察團　提早返瀋陽</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十二日電〕旅大視察團在旅順逗留一週，聞因遇有不能解決之問題，特縮短停留期間，現已離旅順駛葫蘆島，十三日或十四日可返抵瀋陽。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕據有關方面息，天津蘇俄日報五月十二日所載關於大連市中國行政問題之消息中所稱：中國政府對於蘇聯政府請中國政府依照中蘇友好條約，從速建立旅順海軍根據地區域及大連市行政權之表示，迄未置答一節，顯與事實不符。</p>
<p>據悉，我政府遠　　四年十月，即擬派軍登陸大連，　防東北，並　接收旅大。　　方對於我方派軍登陸大連，　　　議，當時另據報，旅大近郊有反政府武力存在，故我方所派旅大地區之行政人員，迄未能前往建立行政權。該報所稱之蘇聯大使本年三月七日之來文，據悉我方曾於同月卅一日答覆，在覆文中聲述我在旅大建立行政權之具體辦法。關於此項辦法經迭次與蘇方交涉，蘇方對我軍進駐旅大，以維護我行政之安全與自由一節，始終持反對態度。現我已派員前往旅大，視察該地情形，以爲在該地恢復我行政權之準備。</p>
<h3>美將加速經濟援華　倫敦注意外蒙軍侵新事件</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十二日電〕此間可靠方面十二日相信，若蘇聯指使外蒙古軍隊侵入新疆能獲得證實，美國將加速其對中國政府乏經濟援助。國務卿馬歇爾及國務院其他官員現正在計劃開始此項援助，以促進進出口銀行五億元之借款。</p>
<p>〔又電〕靈通方面本日並不認爲外蒙軍隊侵入新疆事有國際關係，認爲此事僅新疆最近糾紛事件中最爲猛烈之一例而已。此間認爲所傳具有蘇聯標誌之飛機掩護外蒙軍前進之事，至少在目前不足重視，靈通方面指出，外蒙共和國自與蘇聯締結協定之後，即獲得蘇聯之軍事及其他援助。外蒙軍隊可能利用一九四六年正月以後　自蘇聯之飛機掩護軍隊之前進，而不致使蘇聯直接參預其事。此間一致相信，如果能證明蘇聯與此舉確有連帶關係，結果必使美國在經濟上加速援助中國中央政府。國務卿馬歇爾及國務院正計劃開放進出口銀行之五億美元對華貸款，而給予中國政府若干經濟援助。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十一日電〕本駐外交記者評外蒙軍侵入新疆省之事件稱：外蒙軍侵入新疆或使用蘇聯飛機等報告之傳出，此已非第一次。今年二月間，亦曾獲得此項事件之報告，但以當地中國政府軍隊應付有方，故未擴大。觀察家認爲：如果此次所傳屬實，則外蒙之目的乃在使新疆之一部或全部脫離中國，並不在干涉中國之內戰。</p>
<h3>瀋陽的痙攣　（北方行紀之一）</h3>
<p>— 卜少夫</p>
<p>記者於上月中旬奉館命赴北方視察業務，日昨返滬，此行爲期四週，曾先後在北平，天津，瀋陽三地，各有近週之勾留，旅程中所見所聞，泰多浮光掠影，茲將分篇拉雜記之，俾供關心今日北方局勢之參考者。</p>
<p>落寞的瀋陽，失血過多，　　情狀，可憐惜似的。</p>
<p>由於昌圖，開原的棄守，共軍逼近鐵嶺，使這個失血的瀋陽，突然起了一陣痙攣。五月卅一日侵晨，我在北平西苑機塲臨上軍用機的時候，朋友還勸我考慮是否成行。</p>
<p>這一天，旅大視察團的董彥平，葉南，新六軍副軍長舒適存飛瀋陽，這一天，也是主席離瀋返京的一天。</p>
<p>北陵機塲的規模，較西苑偉大，在兩千尺空中俯矚瀋陽，它略具北平的美，更有北平所無的工業氣魄。空距六百四十KM，兩小時的航程，從北平到瀋陽，在北陵機塲下機時，看到遠遠的機塲外圍一道人的長城，在陽光下構築工事，揭開保衛大瀋陽序幕，當局已發動四萬民工，在積極進行這一緊急措施了。</p>
<p>似乎得感謝過去日本十三年的統治僞滿，戶口辦得嚴格而認真，這次一紙命令，四萬民工依時依地在流他們的汗，此後幾天中，我在瀋陽，每天清晨看見這些勞苦大衆，携帶乾糧鐵鍫，成羣結隊趕往工地，傍晚又見他們三三五五自郊外拖着疲乏的　　，戴着一副冷寂的面部表情回來。</p>
<p>我這個新客，開始接受瀋陽的緊張，慌亂，悶損，痛楚和寂寥了。天是窮高的，無風沙，陽光遺留着春的飴蕩，空氣寗靜，路，長直而寬大，建築物都那麼聳峙巍峨，人的感情，却和這眼前一切景物不調和。</p>
<p>六月一日，警備司令部宣布特別戒嚴令（後又改稱「臨時戒嚴令」），共十一條，凡違反者，一律處以死刑。每日自下午八時三十分至翌日上午六時，除有特別通行證者外，一律禁止通行。這個命令頒布的當日，下午不到八時，商店家家已關上門窗，行人車馬都倉皇地小跑步了，情調頗像抗戰期中後方發放空襲警報，市街越發冷清了。</p>

<p>保安司令長官部最忙碌，參謀長趙家驤更忙碌。司令長官杜聿明抱病，主席蒞瀋，他都未能迎送，還勞主席親赴官邸去探視。四位副司令長官也都坐鎮瀋陽城，祗有孫立人於主席蒞瀋前一日飛往長春。隔兩天又回來了，另外的三位是鄭洞國，馬占山，孫度。可是記者們採訪軍事消息，往往一天見不到一個負責長官，極費力地見到時，又得不到一條具體的新聞資料，人們焦急，記者們更焦急於這種暗中摸索的工作情況。</p>

<h3>四平外圍展開大戰序幕　共軍猛攻終被擊退　瀋陽安定戎嚴時間已縮短</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十二日電〕四平外圍大戰序幕展開，再次集結四平外國之共軍，十一日午夜由東南向四平機塲及車站進攻，砲火連天，戰事激烈，今晨三時始被國軍擊退，戰事轉趨靜寂。瀋陽城區頗安定，戒嚴時間十二日縮短一小時半，十時起至要晨六時止。新任擊備司令彭懸生，副司令王化興，日內正式就職，鄕區流言甚多，鄕民一夕數驚。傳共軍中有外　騎兵接雜，民間盛傳大連蘇軍將假這瀋陽撤退，造成人民不安，長官部表示此為共軍惑亂人心宣傳。</p>

<h3>瀋陽的痙攣</h3>
<p>— 卜少夫</p>
<p>上文接第版</p>
<p>這裏有個插曲。（原文載六月二日中蘇日報本市版）</p>
<p>「冒充朱慶瀾將軍公子，化名朱煌，號國華之某人，前在東北偽稱美軍上尉，撞騙錢財，為惡多端，嗣由朱將軍六公子朱樹（現任東北民報採訪主任）據證吿發，已於上月底，由長官部逮捕送押刻正偵訊中。據聞冒充朱將軍公子之某人，能操英俄語，且能談上海廣東話，人極機警。遠在民廿七年，即於昆明冒充朱公子向龍雲主席，大施騙術，後由查良釗證明其偽，下令逮捕未果，被其逃去，在河內騙楊某。其於抗戰以後及光復後，曾在香港·石家莊·上海·平津等地以朱公子名義冒充團長，騙人甚多。到東北後會騙東大校長臧啟芳，聘為敎授，又騙興安省主席，委為參議，並自稱美軍上尉，着美軍裝，曾被美憲兵逮捕，放出後，復行騙易國端。孫九思·張學銘·馬占山等軍政要人，至此其行騙目的，已非為金錢，含有其他作用。長官部據報後，遂派幹員多人，赴其寓所（民甲街五號）將其逮捕，適該人正擁一日籍美女睡臥中，同時在另室復發現日女一名，並搜獲密電碼，避電針等可疑物品甚多。該人住處極為華麗，門口縣有「浙紹米寓」木牌，口操湖廣音，面淸瘦，嘴唇發紫，或有鴉片烟癮。與伊同眠之日女，聞係偽滿張景惠所用屬官之女。該人除冒充朱將軍公子外，並無任何證件以資證明其眞實姓名及來歷，實屬趣聞。」</p>
<p>翌日，東北前鋒日報「風景線」上有這麼幾句：</p>
<p>「奇事各地有，唯有瀋陽多，竟有冒充朱慶瀾之子招搖撞騙，而被矇蔽者完全是高級顯官，騙子手眞是超人。」</p>
<p>執筆者倘是正面，未免管窺，就我所知，瀋陽不止這位「朱公子」。言外之意，頗値得我們尋思的。</p>
<p>小豐滿電源受阻，瀋陽水電靠本市的兩部破機器了，斷斷續續。資源委員會所屬的一家水泥公司，用最快的速度恢復生產，四五兩月份，每月各有一萬噸出品，現在因為無電，機器不動了。提起了電，有個小故事，孫越崎前次來瀋陽，下榻大轉盤鐵路賓館，眼看對面那座大機關每間房子通宵燈光如畫，他幾乎切齒地說：這是在吸我的血呀！電力是工業的的血，今日東北的工業失血也是停頓的主因之一。</p>
<p>我在鐵西區巡行一週。工廠烟突林中靜寂如廢墟。鐵軌·電力輸送綫·築物·街路，縱橫數十里土地上的這一切，呈現着它的創建人的逐步進行偉大而完整的計劃。有個橡膠廠還在開工，有些蔣它的剩餘原料用完，不停也停了，其餘大多數早入睡眠狀態。拆搬與燬坯，經過這兩種大斷傷，東北工業祇剩下破損的軀報了。</p>
<p>看潘陽，念東北，懊然希國　！在東北工作的人，他們心裏特別雪亮，知道這稱局勢的發展，會造成一個什麼結果來的。有一張報紙呼籲：在軍事方面，政府目前應集中全國兵力於東北；在政治方面，應施行新政，以偽滿政治機構與　政方針為骨幹；在經濟方面，應從速恢復工業。與法幣隔離的流通券經濟壁壘辦法須重加考慮。這個呼籲正確與否，姑不具論，但很足以表示對現狀不滿。</p>
<p>今日東北問題不是單純的軍事問題；而關內未能密切注意關外，在積極方面使他們得不到鼓勵，在消極方面使他們改於盜放。這是我們所應該檢討而加以改正的堂堂高等學府可以用敎授聘審作人靑；一場沙蟹，可以隧便輪竄幾十萬流通券；堅守崗位，清廉精勤，有才具有懷抱的人，却又元事可做，或遇事受阻，能人好人淹蹇了。我所知道的不多，這不多所知道的已够使人憂慮了。</p>
<h3>漢口江面大火　振興輪被焚毀</h3>
<p>加油失愼死一傷八</p>
<p>〔本報漢口十二日電〕漢市四碼頭江邊水面今晨發生大火，停泊該處之昌漢公司振興輪已被焚毀，死火艙油工一人，傷八人，其鄰近有楚安公司拖輪一艘，亦被波及，僅存軀殼。起火原因係振興輸火艙加油時失愼而起。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>正視當前的工資問題</h3>
<p>本年二月十七日，公佈經濟緊急措施方案，規定，「各指定地職工之薪工，按生活指數計算者，應以本年一月份之生活指數為最高指數。」是月，本市生活指數為七，九四五倍。迨五月十日，全國經濟委員會討論上海市工人工資問題，將社會部所呈上海市工資調整暫行辦法修正通過，並議決自五月份實施，而五月份之本市工人生活指數，經公佈為二三·五〇〇倍，比一月份約增兩倍強。於是經濟界頓起騷動，在資方咸認為工資太重。無力負担。紛紛開會商討、。研求對策；並推派代表謂願，希望得一補救的辦法。有一部分商廠，已明白表示不能照付，而仍照四月份工資發給。以至紛紛擾擾，引起許多糾紛。他們所持的理由是：（一）所增太多，不堪負担；（二）社會購買力太薄弱，無從轉嫁；（三）從前所拋出的定貨，以成本激增，不堪虧累：（四）工商業本已陷入窘境，今雪上加霜，將迫使加速崩潰；（五）政府正在抑平物價，不宜抬高成本，助長漲風。而其所提出的最具體辦法，為計算工資，旣悉依戰前為基礎，則戰後工人所增底薪為不合理，亦應回復到戰前標凖。以示平允。上項論據，自亦持之有故，言之成理。顧勞方則以為。（一）卅元以上的底薪，已按折扣發給，卽不能謂悉依戰前為某礎；：（二）工商業的危機，其因素甚多，不能歸咎於高工資這一點；有許多事業，縱使工資再打折扣或令工人全　義務，亦未必卽能站穩；（三）拿米價來說，戰前普通工資三四十元，可以買米四五擔，如今拿到七八十萬元，只能買到兩擔：（四）戰前工資，有一部分確乎太低，不能不酌予提高以資調整。</p>
<p>因此之故，當局表示：（一）回復戰前底薪為不可能；（二）如事實困難，只可個別自行解決，更無統籌捕救的可能；（三）或可酌增工時，增加生產，以貼補資方的損失：（四）在問題朱解決前，資方應先酌發一部分工資，以維持工人的生活，工人則應照常工作，以免生產停頓。在此期內，資方不得關廠關店，勞方亦不得罷工怠工，以增加本問題的困難。</p>
<p>原來生活指數，雖是一個良好的尺度，足為解決爭端時一個有力的憑蹬。但與標準工資不同，尤與硬性的法定工資有別。只以復員之初，工潮紛起，不得已而提出此項統計，作為談判的基礎；當時原沒有把牠作為固定的與劃一的標準之意思。所以引用未久，卽成立了一個工資評議會來斟酌活用，以彌補此項缺陷。後來，本市某金融機關與某公用機關，並分頭自編指數，各別運用，以期適應事實。其他工商各業，未按指數計薪的，為數更復不少。足證此項標準的普徧適用，在事關上沒有辦通；在理論上，亦未盡圓滿。</p>
<p>不幸物價波動太劇。工資爭議太多，於無可如何之中，這生活指數，竟被認作惟一的標準，習慣成了自然，就好像這指數和工資，便是一而二，二而一的東西，無如實際究難盡合，變通隨處可見。例如折扣發給一節，有少數較為困難的工商業，如針織業等，在去年，卽曾協議施行過，其高級職員適用此例者，為數尤多。故指數折扣，並不能算是最新的產物。其於應用指數以外，另行加以補充的，如增加底薪，配給實物，發給獎金，供給膳宿等，其事不少槪見。而指數凍結以後，日用必需品的配售，（在本市為折發差金，）又是對於指數計薪的一種補救辦法。所以適用生活指數，實際上的變態甚多。</p>
<p>工資調整暫行辦法第五條。載明：「資方如因生產及營業情形不佳，確難負擔，不能照本辦法三至五條規定，發給工資時，得由勞資雙方協議减少之。」這項規定，與其謂為創作，無寧謂為推廣運用，較符實際。因為事實上，按照指數計薪的，或已高於指數，或尙低於指數，此項結果，大都從雙方協議中得來，正不必以資方現在確難負擔，方好適用這個原則。</p>
<p>土資是勞力的代價，代價的升降，自有其自然調整的規律。在某種塲合，雖不妨加以種種人為的限制，但限制工資，等於限價，協議工資，等於議價。這兩種比較起來，自以議價較為合理。不過生及營業情形，各各不同，卽在同一時期，同一業中，其力量與盈虧情形，亦不可一槪而論。所以同工同酬，同地同酬等原則，至少在協議時，不甚適用。不能不依據事實，分別斟酌，以求恰如其分。當局主張個別解決，各自協議，我們認為最切實際，確比統籌補救易於着手。</p>
<p>所謂各自協議，其意義卽展分別妥協，故其要件全在互和容忍。勞資雙方，，必須知己知彼，互諒互讓，而後妥協始可吿成。倘只知各顧立塲。堅持片面利益，而毫無同舟共濟的觀念，茶或於協議進行之中，藉端肇事，造成意外糾紛，迫使對方勉强就範，則暫時縱或成功，最後終必失敗。故在這難關重重的時候，我們很誠摯地盼望雙方，放大眼光，出以最大的容忍：更望當局以至誠態度，勸導雙方，覓取合理的解決。至所謂代購原料，减輕捐稅，便利運輸，開拓銷路，和舉辦正當之貸款等，確屬根本救濟的辦法。如能代為呼籲，切實兌現，俾工的業獲有轉機，則今日所見為無力的，日後未嘗不可舉重若輕，應付裕如；那末，一切困難，自可迎刃而解了。</p>

<h3>阻止共產勢力伸入西歐　美不再袖手旁觀　今後發展胥視蘇聯態度</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十二日電〕美蘇兩國關係，本日已趨於「攤牌」之重要關頭，由於匈牙利及保加利亞更進一步之投向蘇聯懷抱，美國準備；（一）除非蘇聯對於匈共黨推翻那基政府之方式，同意進行適當之調查，美國進備將此事訴諸聯合國。（二）為保存法國義大利及奧地利之民主政府起見，美國擬採取經濟及外交行動，以建成阻止共產主義西進之堅强陳綫。</p>
<p>國務院已於十一日以美國自社魯門總統三月十二日發表反極權主義以來所運用之最强硬語調，照會蘇聯稱；美國決不任令莫斯科在匈牙利所指使之行動，可通行無阻。美蘇關係之前途，端賴於蘇聯對於美國要求不受拘束地調查匈牙利情况事之答覆如何。蘇聯如拒絕美國之要求，美國即擬訴諸聯合國。美國之强硬照會，明白表示美國正在考盧此項計劃，並斥賣蘇聯推綱自由選出之那基政府，而窮兇極惡地干涉匈牙利內政。蘇聯之行動實破壞雅爾達協議，不諭美國抗義後之結果如何，美國不願在共黨伸展勢力至其他政府之間。再袖手旁觀。</p>
<p>國務卿馬歇爾之政策委員會已奉命停止研究世界經濟問題，及其對於美國外交政策之影響。該委會之工作現已集中歐洲一隅，其他「阻止共產主義」方法之研究亦在進行中，諸如：</p>
<p>（一）義大利方面，美國擬以大規模援助給予加斯貝利總理所領導之非共產政府，包括早日撥給聯總結束後之一億二千五百萬美元救濟援助，批准義大利所計劃之動用進出口銀行貸款一億元，凍結於美國境內之義國資產六千萬元予以解除，與義進行商業筑務航空談判。</p>
<p>（二）法國方面，美國贊成世界銀行再以二億五千萬美元貸予賴瑪迪總理之反共政府，而協助法國之四年復興計劃。此外或將供以穀類及機器，作為救濟法國之另一方式。</p>
<p>（三）奧地利方面，如果發現蘇聯在奧國有發動政變之跡象，美國或將展緩美國昔日所要求之平日通過對奧和約。</p>
<h3>美外交雙管齊下　嚴辭抗議蘇策動匈政變　譴責保逮捕反對黨領袖</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十一日電〕美國就匈牙利最近之事件，向匈京盟管會蘇主席史維里杜夫將軍提出之嚴辭抗議書，已於今日發表。其中指責蘇聯違反雅爾達協定，公然干涉匈牙利政務，並要求由三强委員團立即調查匈政治局勢。抗議書並謂，美政府鑒於雅爾達協定之義務，並以匈停戰協定簽字國及聯合國會民之地位，如不獲同意前項辦法，以進行適當之調查，當視局勢之需要，考慮其他此等行動。關於據云護自匈農民黨秘書長柯伐克之供辭，抗議書有云，盟管會之英美委員並禾獲知引起那基總理等辭職之前項情報、實麗違背盟管會軍程第六章「C」項之規定，該款規定英美代表有權獲取英美政府所感興趣之一切報吿文件之副本。美政府認為匈牙利之發展，已使在上屆選舉中僅獲百分之十七之人民支持的少數黨，廢止大多數人民所表示之意志。共黨領袖賴柯錫顯然亦已承認此一局勢，渠對於其鐵卷黨之因此得以接收對匈牙利之控制，已曾公然表示滿意。</p>
<p>〔路透社華感頓十一日電〕國務院今日發表聲明，譴蓋保加利亞反對黨領袖貝特柯夫被捕之事。聲明有謂，見特柯夫若被控叛國罪而被審判，則目前之保加利亞政權，亦將受許多保加利亞人民之意見及保國國外一切自由人民之與論的審判。貝特柯夫為依法選舉之國會議員，渠之領導反對黨及維護人權之奮鬥，已引起美國深刻之同情。查雅爾達協定，保停戰協定及和平條約，均有保障保國人民自由之規定，美國政府前此就保國政局之發展，已一再表示關切，良以此等發展，與雅爾達協定之文字及精神均已完全運背故也。</p>
<h3>那基指出蘇聯　施納粹故技</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十一日電〕范雪達今夜向上院宣讀匈前總理那基之來函，其內容譴賣蘇聯施行納粹故技，將匈牙利完全置於共黨控制之下。略謂蘇聯之目的，乃欲擊潰匈牙利資產階級之民主政治，其行動實與德納粹黨徒如出一轍。</p>
<h3>保捷軍事代表團　先後訪南都　羅南談判獲協議</h3>
<p>〔中央社貝爾格勒十一日合衆電〕捷克軍事訪問團今日緊編保加利亞軍事訪問團之後抵此。盟國觀察家臆測，保南正準備成立巴爾幹聯邦，而以劃一軍事之合作，為聯邦之開始。捷克訪問團由國防部長沙佛報達率領，將在此作二日逗留，而後在南國各地旅行十日。八日抵此之保加利亞代表團之訪問，具有半秘密性質，該團顯已離此間，惟仍在南國境內。</p>
<p>〔合衆社貝爾格勒十二日電〕據政府宣布：南斯拉夫與羅馬尼亞在最近之會談中，對防衛多瑙河臘衆之主　利益之公同政策，已有協議。</p>
<h3>保農民黨議員　廿三名被除名</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十二日廣播：保加，利亞國民大會投票表決，將農民黨廿三人除名，該黨為共黨控制下組國陣綫之主要反對派。大會認定該廿三人係自動辭職，但彼等對國會之最後聲明，則謂「並未辭職」。該黨秘書長即現以陰謀叛國罪被逮捕之貝特柯夫。</p>
<h3>波蘭逮捕反對黨</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華沙十一日電〕官方頃宣布：波蘭反對黨領袖米柯拉齊克所領導之蠱民黨黨員四人，因被控發行秘書手册，於星期日在農民黨總部被捕。</p>
<h3>美國務院重視　近東中東地帶</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十日電〕美國務際高級人士稱：全體主要國家在近東及中東地帶利益之衝突，業使該地成為最可能之未來戰爭　源地，持此論者，為美近東及非洲司司長韓德遜，渠向參院　款委員會闡釋，並請求增加該　之人員。同時遠東司司長范宣繼舊委員會謂，遠東司極需精幹之人員，俾佐助明年與日本進行談判及草擬日本和約事宜。</p>
<h3>蘇匈兩國議訂　新軍事同盟　匈派遺軍官赴蘇受訓</h3>
<p>〔聯合社匈京十一電〕今日據可靠消息：蘇聯現正與匈牙利議訂和平時期軍事互助新同盟，俾一旦發生戰事，匈軍可與蘇軍合作。蘇聯並同竟在莫斯科蘇聯戰術學院訓練匃高級軍官，前匈京警察總監紫里翁等將為匃牙利受蘇軍訓練之第一批人員。但陸軍部官員對於此說，以及匈軍官在外多瑙比亞參觀蘇軍演習之說，旣未證實亦未否認。據一部份匈人士稱，匈牙利電台曾發表廣播，警吿人民凡談論此種軍事演習者將遭逮捕。又據消息靈通人士稱，依照大戰結束時成立之協定，匈軍隊保證一旦發生戰事參加蘇方，但俟和約最後批准，此項協定即吿無效，故蘇聯現有與匈談判簽訂新協定之舉。</p>
<h3>英政府持審愼態度　注視匈保奧局勢　認為英蘇間應樹立友誼</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十一日電〕上院舉行外交辯倫時，政府發言人巴根漢　爵宣布，英駐匈代表已奉令向匈政府明白表示，英政府正以極度審愼之態度注視匈局勢，如有脫離民主原則之任何情形，必致嚴重影響英匈間之政治及經濟關係。</p>
<p>關於奧局勢，巴氏謂，政府於自報端獲悉奧政治家從事商談，以改組奧政府以獎更其性質後，深為不安。英政府確信奧政府必能維持其民主基礎，並拒絕向任何壓力屈服。巴氏繼謂，英國認英蘇之間應樹立友誼，使歐洲不致分裂為二，職是之故，政府對英蘇貿易談判極為重視。巴氏又曰，共黨今已在匈牙利取得與其地位不相稱之控制種，在政府知悉共黨是否將不顧國會及人民而鞏固其地位或蘇聯政府是否得如英政府之願遵守雅爾達協定規定之義務以前，殊難確定其對於匈局勢之態度。英政府鑒於蘇聯對解放匈牙利所從事之供獻，從未欲排除蘇在匈應享之權利，但在此等情形下，匈牙利亦不應因此不得與其他國家樹立友誼。英國不信匈人民願使其國家成為任何强國之附庸，苟因目前之發展而使匈牙利成為極權國家，使目前民主政權受到壓迫，則英政府熱須修正其態度。</p>
<h3>印各藩籌組織邦　擬建賴基斯坦國</h3>

<h3>贊成國際管制原子工廠　蘇化表提新建議　惟否決權問題仍未解決</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖十一日電〕聯合國原子能委員會本日舉行會議時，蘇聯代表葛羅米柯宣稱：蘇聯政府贊成國際管制並監察所有原子能工廠，礦坑及存儲之原料，於此可見原子能問題之獲得解決，已有顯著之進展。葛羅米柯對於設立國際管制原子能問題提出若干新建議，首就爭議不決之「監察」一詞表示其意見，此為舊氏以前所拒不加以解釋者。葛羅米柯之演說雖為趨向妥協之一種新步驟，但有資格方面則指出葛羅米柯之建議範圍過於狹窄，否決權問題一日不解決，確切之協議即一日不能成立。葛羅米柯所提出之建議其要點如下：</p>
<p>（一）原子能管　機關，即國際管制原子能委員會，應由國際人士組織而成。（二）該委員會應按期考察各國之原子能工廠，礦產及存儲之原料以考核原子能之使用。（三）該會應有向各國政府及安全理事會提供建議之權力，俾提出對於違反禁造原子武器公約之國家，所當採取之措施。（四）該會並應有權研究用於和平用途之原子能以保持有效之管制，各國亦得個別進行用諸和平目的之原子能研究工作，但必須經由國際管制委員會互相交換其在原子能方面之發現及進展云。</p>
<h3>裁减軍備問題　美蘇仍難接近</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖十一日電〕關於所有軍備包括原子武器在內，應否同時加以討喻一項問題，頃由聯合國裁减軍備委員會開會加以審議，美蘇兩國代表意見相左，又發生舌虎。蘇代表萇羅米柯曰：就余所見，欲將所謂一般軍備問題與原子武器及大規模破壞武器問題分別討論，實為不可能者。美代表奧斯汀對於蘇聯之建議表示不能贊同，據稱　人若同時審議栽减一般軍備與原子軍備之方法，則勢將踰越安全理事會所予本會之職權範圍云。</p>
<h3>汪逆叛國　蓄意於廿七年秋</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京十二日電〕前偽政府之最高取問，筆中”本特務機構「　機關」負責人影佐禎昭中將，頃向軍事法庭提出之答辯書中，關於汪逆與日本勾結一節，叙述頗詳。據稱：二十七年秋日太今井大佐已與梅逆思平在滬作成「和平草案」，十一月影佐與今井再赴上海與梅淤晤面，決定與汪逆逃出重慶之同時發表所謂一多平條件。二十七年十二月廿日汪運到達河內裡時，二十二日近衛即發表所謂三十原則聲明，汪逆幽即毅發絕電響應。影佐本人當時與失野務次官及犬養健等（按大養為日前首相犬養毅之子，此次選舉前為民主黨　記長，已被整備）曾趕往河內與汪逆同船抵滬，而樹立獨政府之計劃，幽即在船中與汪逆商妥者。影佐同時　露日本一衛支持汪逆，一面曾由松圖外相等企圖誘我抗戰中之國民政府，然奸計終不得售云云。</p>

<h3>軍政府美籍官員透露　日財閥並未消滅　實力仍能左右日本政府</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京十二電〕麥帥總部發言人今日報告，日本財閥統制之中堅已遭摧毀，此言與大阪美國官員意見殊屬相反。據總部經濟科學組反托辣斯股主任惠爾許稱，日本重要產業公司六十七家之醫　及投　權，已由日政府淸理委會接政府管理。大阪軍政府官員則于上星期吿聯合社訪員稱，日本財閥並未消滅，其產業公司之解散，股票之出售，與工業巨閥之剝奪資格，對于結束財閥編制絕少實際影響，現任官吏仍多向之請示，股票則上下其手，不知實際果為何人所有、經濟領袖雖經整　，但仍于裏後操縱工業。大阪工業家勢力雄厚，實際可以左右東京政府，目前雖由社會黨總理組織聯合政府，並未能改奕此項均勢。</p>

<h3>聯合發電廠　決定三原則　純粹民營組織　希望外資加入</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕爲解決本市電荒問題，市參議會已通過統一本市發電機構，組織聯合發電廠。記者特於昨日走訪公用局長趙曾玨，叩詢聯合發電廠之籌設計劃。據趙局長稱：本市電力極感恐慌，聯合發電廠之組織自屬需要，俾能集中資金，節省物力，使機器及專門按　人才得以配合應用，故公用局對市參議會之提案絕對擁護。該局已就財力，物力，及組織三方面，決定聯合發電廠之三大原則如下：</p>
<p>資金方面：聯合發電廠希望利用外資，更歡迎國內有力資金，以各佔全數之一半爲原則。外資方面，自以美國資金可能性最大，國內方面，希望原有之各電力公司皆能踴躍參加，不足之數，則歡迎銀行家及企業家等投資云。</p>
<p>機器方面：要求中央顧念本市電荒嚴重，儘先將日敵賠償物資撥交聯合發電廠應用。現有五萬三千瓩發電機一座，由日本運來，中央已允先撥供本市應用，不日即可抵滬。此外尚有三萬五千瓩發電機數座，該局亦已呈請中央撥與本市。又中央之國營事業當有配售民營者，聯合發電廠將請求有優先承購權。</p>
<p>組織方面：聯合發電廠之機構爲純粹民營，且絕對民主。市政府並不參加任何股份，儘量吸收本市之各華商公司，　原有之電力公司皆成爲聯合發電廠股東之一，需電時，可向廠方批購，其合同由各公司自行擬訂之。對於各電力公司之原有權利，將儘量予以維護。至於聯合發電廠之詳細組織合約，據趙局長告記者，該局將邀　本市各電力公司負責人，並請市參會推派代表共同討論之。具體合約擬定後，經市政會議通過後，即　市參議會決定，俟市參會通過後，再　中央核定云。</p>

<p>紡建昨開小組會議　資產單價已估定　紡織事業調節委會下週成立　　〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司佔價委員會單價小組會，於昨日下午三時，在該公司舉行會議。新任防織估價委會主委劉泗英，特親臨主持。到歐陽崙·楊錫仁·技術專家高吉生·保德等十餘人，討論至五時許散會。討論提案，為該公司各項資產·業已佔定其民國廿六年時之單價。該項估定單價，並已交由各專家，分別審查核定，特提出昨日小組會中通過，俾再提交今日召開之紡建佔價委會，作最後之核定。　　按紡建估價委會，下設兩小組會，一為單價小組會，一為佔價小組會。前者事事佔定公司資產在民廿六年時之單價，後者乃在佔定公司資產按民廿六年時之頭價，應該增值之倍數問題。聞該公司之佔價工作，經積極推進後，約可於一二個月內完成云。　　〔本報訊〕經濟部紡織事業調節委員會全部人選，業由經部於十一日發表。聞定下星期在滬成立。昨晨自京抵滬之經部代理政次劉泗英氏，對此亦已加證實。據談：渠此來任務，為主持召開中國紡建公司佔價委員會。至紡調會會務之推展，施政方針等，須詢新主委鄒秉文。惟紡調會純係一新機構，與原有紡管會會務，並無移交接替之關係云。　　查發表之紡調會人選，主委鄒秉文，現任聯合國糧農組織執委，係我國棉產農業專家。副主委兩人，一為王啟宇，現任第六區棉紡公會理事長。一為童李齡，現任經部常次。委員十人，屬於民營廠者有榮鴻元（申新）。唐星海（慶豐）。郭棣活（永安）。張文潛（大生三廠）等四人。國營廠有束雲章。李升伯。吳味經三人。此外委員尙有劉泗英（經部代理政次），劉攻芸（中央銀行副總裁），袁仲達（前貿易委會外銷物資委會副主委）三人。紡調會設四處，業務處長吳味經兼，技術術長李升伯兼，秘書處長袁仲逵兼，財務處長王子建。　　記者曾於昨午與主委鄒秉文晤談，承吿：經部雖已發表渠任紡調會主委，惟渠以種種現賣困難，未能解決，故迄未表示接受。渠於接聘書後，並已於日前上兩陳部長墾辭。渠表示在未接受斯職前，對該會施策或工作方針，無法表示意見。惟渠稱：茲事體大，當不容懸面不決，約三兩天內可見分曉云。　　據六區棉紡公會理事長王啟宇語記者：經部發表渠在紡調會之新職，渠正在考慮婉辭。緣渠身為六區公會理事長，又兼紡調會新職，在執行職務之性質上言，不無相當牴觸，自感承上啟下難以克盡厥職，故望當局准渠專任公會之職。渠認為紡調會今後最大之課題，厥應從增加植棉着手，俾根本解決原料困難，同時撙節國家外匯。　　紡建公司副總經理吳味經，對經部發表渠為紡調委員兼業務處長職，亦表示難於接受。尤以業務處長之兼職，渠認為紡建公司本身業務，已極感繁瑣，今如再出主紡調會業務機構，尤感有其處境及地位上之困難云。市氣渙散　華股交易寥落　美亞新股跌停板　　華股昨大部份交易轉移陣地，棄遞就現，以致遞交檯面，幾有不能開市之象。現遞掉期相差遂近，套利息價特別低廉，交易淸寥，人心仍見不定，惟空方有補，且美債證金問題，希望未絕，尙能由疲盤穩，祇美亞新股慘吿跌停。　　晨初以隔前國行交換差出，即交股開出微堅，惟遞交股因證金問題，使各經紀人無法接受新交易。實力雄厚之號家，咸以代客收解為營業，全部轉往現交活動。初時竟寂然無成交者甚久，開後三一號一〇二號一〇八號等有納，即交永紗升至五六五〇元，遞交永紗升為五八八〇元。六九號二二四號一三三號一九九號賣出，降落一百元。此時一一〇號買進現永紗，六九號三六號一〇四號雖納遞永紗，但以一九〇號一五二號二三〇號四七號賣出現永紗，七六號一一七號一五五號亦賣遞永紗，逐漸下游。現美亞由一六〇號一一七號，遞美亞由二一九號九七號二一一號均吿掛低至跌停限度，即交華豐亦然。遞交永紗退至五五三〇元，現永紗亦低至五三六〇元。一〇四號八九號三六號三三五號乘低有納，一八八號亦進現永紗，低後逐漸盤穩。　　延至十一時半，忽見俏利，一五五號補進永紗二三一號六一號八九號一〇二號亦有購買，漲勢見勁，信和由八五號一六三號一五二號之購買，亦吿轉俏，遞永紗高價達五八五〇元，現永紗五六六〇元，散多乘高紛紛了結，二四號等亦有脫手，一八六號亦供現永紗，近午曾將遞永紗迫降至五六〇〇元內，即交又達五四〇〇左右。一〇二號乘低來進，九七號一五二號忽進現永紗，臨收時突又抬高，即交永紗升至五六五〇元。遞永紗升至五七九〇元結束。　　收後遞永紗繼續扳高，喊高至五八五〇元以上，結果較前收計永紗微升，新光信和景福新華微挫，永公獨平，勤興跌半成，華豐降一成，而美亞新股獨吿跌停。應安大通榮豐平平，火柴中紡統益新亞五和微挫，國貨中絲跌一成弱，水泥景綸跌半成强。遞交股計永紗永公各升半成左右，信和微升，華舉跌半成，景福平平，新光微降，美亞跌停，塲外各老股仍形疲軟。統價盤旋　外股平穩　　昨銀樓見鬆，公債略形盤上。統丙晨開六二〇〇元，二三〇室三六〇室六〇四室有售，五五〇室五五一室五五二室均進，盤高至七五〇〇元，而後稍平，成交約五百萬。結果較前收計甲乙升五百元，丙漲一千元，丁升四百元，統戊漲起一千一。　　外股昨平靜而盤，洋商雖售，惟證券帮則有補空。怡紗晨開五六〇〇〇元，低價五四五〇〇元，而後復回上至晨開價徘徊。結果較前收計怡紗微升，會德豐怡啤航業微降，紙業獨平。英聯業廣鋼業各跌半成左右。糧食來源充沛　米價可告穩定　　民食調配會趕辦配米　　日內米市又略現彼動狀態，據悉週初蚌埠方面到三列車，計九十噸，適逢大雨，一部份因受潮濕，致貨主急於售脫，喊價慘跌至二十萬，市情之低落，該批到貨現已光後售罄，市情由是回漲。民食調配會調配科長吉明齊昨稱，米市因調配會之開始配米，及來源充沛，故市情在近期內，決無反常之可能。　　又訊：昨日南北兩市共到米糧五千六百餘石，運跌之後，店方乘巧納取，零化轉殷。北市粳秈米均見回挺五六千至萬元，白陰元平平，南市則早市依然懈淡，午時見緊，結果高貨粳秈略呈活靈，中下仍呆，白陰元無榮辱。　　麵粉實銷仍稀，早堅午疲，趨勢軟化。鈇皮因新麥登塲，鄕銷不振，續疲千元，豆餅汕頭略動，轉升一二千元，黃豆東北來貨見增，大速即將開放，大批南下，人心虛浮，狂跌五六千至萬元。菉豆受主難覓，再低二三千元。赤豆乏人問津，紅糧去化亦懈，猛跌萬元。　　苞米逐步下降，再跌三五千元，芝蔴貨稀挺定，生仁交易寥寥，成交有限，東北隴海　源　申，繼續步跌七八千元。新　豆各路來貨異常湧旺，市消呆滯。中次全無做聞，高貨零化略動，極為稀寥，鑟見慘跌一二萬元。小麥廠方仍在擯小之中，未有做開，面內地產區均見下挫，油市堅疲不一，豆油供源充沛，再跌萬元。濟油亦步削萬元，生產則廣帮讀吸，再漲五六千至萬元，菜油因新菜子登場。人心平平，小車蔴油　加二三萬元。對日貿易恢復後　進出口均有不利　　〔本報訊〕某出口界人士談稱：今秋中日間私人貿易恢復後，因兩國間之幣制尙無聯擊，故可能有進口限額之外，採取「以物易物」方式進行。貿易恢復之初，貨物之數量可能甚少，但日本生產力之恢復，遠較我國迅速，其物價工價又較我國穩定低廉，為時一久，對日貿易又將成為有進無出之現像，此則為危機所在。又日本善於經營加工出口業，其世界商業情報網又甚完密，將來可能將我國之各種土產如猪鬃等加工，然後輸至歐美易取外匯，即以此外匯購進外貨，轉手輸入我國，操縱其間，以獲厚利。糧部管制司長說明　麥貸遲未核准原因　　四聯總處上週四未將麥貸提付討論，第四區麵粉工業同業公會以新麥業已登場，政府對本年度親麥政策迄未決定，特於十一日召開臨時代表大會集議。當日會後，糧食部管制司長汪竟良氏因公來滬，邀集該業理監事談話。據稱麥貸遲遝未蒙核准者，有三點原因，（一）該業會員六十餘單位，大型廠福新等五家，佔貸款百分之六十·中型廠十家，餘為小型廠，合計佔貸款百分之四十。四聯總處負責人及央行張總裁主張，僅貸與大型廠，其餘不能兼及。（二）廠商要求貸額雖係採購原料最少限度之資金，惟當局認為過高，正考慮核减。（三）去歲麥貸由交通銀行負主要責任，今以國家銀行皆事業化，本年擬由中農行會同其他行局負責，技術部份猶未商妥。廠商方面當即表示如本年度政府對麥貸不擬訂立通盤計劃，則處此米糧進入靑黃不接之際，民食間題必首當其衝，固非僅係一業之利害所關，而近日中信局在滬起卸六〇〇〇噸洋粉，此舉或將予貸款以若干影響，而以該業公會立塲而言，則大廠貸款可暫緩，俾使貸額减少，分配於各中小型廠應用。最近產地麥價下跌至鉅，如每畝產麥二擔，一家四口或五口，耕種十畝，去除各項應有開支，已與農民耕種成本相抵無餘，實不宜任其再行下跌。現因政府政策舉棋不定，使廠方莫知適從。汪司長當允以該業意見，具呈糧部，向四聯總處磋商，迅予發放云。紗花布平疲　　昨日紗市現貨籌碼充沛，塲中本客實需轉淸，四二支藍鳳紗比上日軋小十五萬元，為一千二百十萬元。其餘廿支特雙馬及十六支光明等市均扯降，自五萬至十五萬元不等。惟十六支三明及十支金寳星粗紗獨好五萬元。　棉布初開尙堅，旋因散戶及業中人厄於銀根，微有跑止售，致十二磅各檔　布市盤比上日一致下挫。士林布仍站原價，跳鯉元直貢緞及灰光斜元光斜因市上現底不充，粵帮採辦，市稍趨俏。漂布木街及長江帮搜吸，軋升一二千元。　　棉花因國外市價稍升，人心略堅。惟銀根仍緊，同時紗價略小，欲漲無力，市况仍疲，成交比上日稍旺。午後同業對做沙市一一〇件，價一四三萬，紗廠進靈寳棉三九六件，價一四八至一五六萬。南太倉做開二〇〇擔，價一一五萬。漢口細絨成交二八件，價一四〇萬。以上價格除漢細及一部份靈寳為送廠價外，其餘均為棧交價。六區棉紡公會　邀宴紡調主委　　〔本報訊〕第六區棉紡公會，將定於今日下午一時，在永安公司新厦十二樓，邀宴紡調會主委鄒葉文·及委員若干人。聞席問對原料之供應，棉紗之再生產成木，及棉紗價格與一般物價之配合品瓿題，均將提出作初步之意見交換云。紡建循例售布　　〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例售布，共售布二一九三〇疋，被單二二〇條，廠商申購者十戶，共二二四〇疋。布號中購單六二三張，共一九六九〇疋，被單二二〇條食糧升隆互見　　昨白糖因台配價升百分之十六，除秘魯砂略有回好外，餘則均在平疲中，靑糖以去化呆滯，反見稍鬆，公會劃盤，秘魯砂升一萬元，二〇台中砂及台赤市均見微鬆，號貨開出汕提靑小五千元，棉赤小三千元，僅數十包交易，興化白四十五萬六千元至四十四萬元，高莊興赤三十四萬七千元至三十四萬元，成交二百餘襄，刁靑小萬元，成交三百餘包。絲綢交易清淡　　昨市人造絲始疲終堅，一二〇號旭字有光，上午最小喊過一千七百四十萬元，午收盤為七百五十萬元。下午稍呈堅挺，最後為七百七十萬元賣出價，比上日大起十萬元。七五號半光及一五〇號有光，喊價仍站原狀。　　昨市廠經益形淸淡，因實銷戶均存觀望，故高勻度五担頭竟乏成交，喊價仍與上日相仿。另担老虎灶新絲，昨有幾担做開，價二千二百萬元及二百五十萬元兩檔，干經亦無交易，喊價與上日無異。　　昨市綢貨稍堅，眞絲被面喊價大起十萬元，華强被面八百九十萬元有成交，大誠被面喊九百十萬元，不過未曾做開。格子璧縐前市做三萬三千七百元，後因賣多於買，一度小至四五百元，最後三千六百元有交易，隔日期做開八百五十元至九百元。華錦縐昨做一萬七千元，人絲羽紗一萬六千五百元亦有成交。其他各貨，與上日無甚軒輊。燃管會調整煤價　　〔本報訊〕經濟部上海區燃管會因開濼，東北，台灣，淮南，華東各礦工作，自六月一日起，已實行調整。輪船運費，亦自每噸四萬六千元，調整至每噸十一萬元。故煤斤到滬成本，每噸最低需四十六萬元，南京為三十一萬元。故該會六月份之各種煤價，業經調整如次：　　一，供應上海各公用事業，平均每噸為十四萬五千元。一，南京電廠每噸十萬元。一，沿京滬滬杭各電廠每噸十九萬元。一，京滬，滬杭，浙贛，平漢鐵路，及海軍軍運，每噸十二萬五千元。一，隴海，津浦，在徐州蚌埠交貨，每噸八萬餘元。一，船舶軍政機關，每噸自十四萬五千元起。總計上開各項，每月共需煤量十七萬六千噸。按上列各項供煤之售價，自二月起，迄未變更，其與新成本之差額，經由物價會議提請國務會議通過，由政府全部補貼。關於工廠及民生等用煤，則均照成本配售。　　又據該會主委徐樂天於昨日向記者表示：本人因胃潰瘍病病加劇，難勝重任，曾一再懇切請辭，雖經陳部長迭予慰留，然自知精力有限，雖置生命於度外，亦恐為時甚暫，於會務無補。適陳部長來滬視察之便，曾將病情醫證等當面呈閱外，並請添派副主任委員一人

<p>新醫與新藥社團生活之感想  龐京周　　上海醫師公會召開春季大會後作　　　本人在此次醫師公會大會中，必須担任出席市參會的報吿，然而當上海一屆二次市參大會時，社會經濟各方面情形都在惡化，心所謂危，曾於未開冪前向市參會提供幾種重要意見，—原草來說幾乎是一個提案之提案，—以便我們所討論者可以側重要點，避免瑣屑，其原則不外（甲）凡事急其所急勿浪費時間唇舌（乙）凡事重實際與可能勿蹈空泛高調之譏，（丙）不宜苛擾百姓不宜嚴刑峻法蓋世亂已亟民不聊生固已不畏死也，（丁）先以政績博取民心復以建設成績謀捐稅之增加，因爲此項建議之提出遂未便由本人再爲同道作枝枝節節之請求，或向市政府作瑣碎之責詢，然而本人此項主張固嘗獲報紙與論所實可。倘能做到幾分，恐亦即為全市之民之福，而本會會員當亦間接直接蒙受其益。想亦本會同人所願耳。　　然而事實上市參會中，往往各葉代表均就各業立塲發言較爲熱烈。本人此種作風是否合乎我醫公會選我時之要求。竊嘗疑焉。但依個人觀感。凡代表各業之議員。對於其本業權益首先提出注意。當然賣無旁貨然就議會精神之另一方面言。則各業各區的議員亦不妨就上海一般市政加以檢討。而發言。而辯難。而結論。產生之結果。往往較諸各業。僅就一小天地爲出發點以立諭。更形偉大。更形切要。更易公正。　　其次則本人又復以爲市參議員監督政府措施。指摘官吏失職。固是應有責任。反之。吾人保護一良好之官吏。或擁護政府某一良好之政策。似亦吾人本分。總之正是非。講公道。方蓮生議會之眞正成果。自不待言。然而今日之下。是否不吹毛不指摘即爲一般人士所贊同。吾又不能無疑。本人善支將政府某項建議。—（合理而有益於市民者。）嘗就上海實况體諒政府某項困難。嘗排解議會中不必要之糾紛。乃一部份人士竟嫌本人過於和平。殊不能索解。更有人以爲醫師公會所產生之議員。必將處於衛生局之敵對地位。應多多過問衛生行政。並加以指摘挑剔。不然者。即爲意外。本人總覺此種見解近乎短視。且亦未必與議會制度之基本精神相符。但是上海却普遍存着此種觀點。　　本人由近來社會上各項關係之中。—議會中亦偶有現象—發見所謂「派別觀念」與所謂「感情用事」的許多事例。此在各國各業各事之間皆所難免。然率皆有其限度。而此限度則以不憤事不妨公益不變各該討論事項之本質爲範疇。近來我國尤其上海。却未免超過此種限度。往往由感情用事。而變成指鹿爲馬。由派別鬥爭。而曲解是非。誤解政治手腕，誤認門戶鬥爭。超越常軌流毒無已。本人常覺吾人旣服屬於「自然科學」。則處事發言辯解指證。胥以正義邏輯爲依歸。至態度之審愼尤爲首要。吾醫界同人果皆能如是。乎今日社會上一般習尙果能必是乎。吾又不能無疑。　　由此吾嘗迴溯若干年前。上海市醫師公會初創。本人與余雲岫牛惠生在企張蔡禹門諸君。本乎消除派別之旨努力於本會之建立。從余先生之學問德望。牛先生之直爽與幹練中。使本人追隨學習得了許多好榜樣。亦會在消泯派別觀念上開關了不少新道路。尤其死去的牛惠生君。他確曾爲此得罪同學責備朋友犧牲自己的精神。他在醫界的團結與醫師的品德方面。確曾建立着一種志願。他從未有一言一動利用了「派別的存在」。而獲取他自身的權利或地位。這一個朋友。眞使我們在今日這種傾軋擾亂的風氣中。益覺懷侌不置。　　記得某年。本人曾因替醫師公會急籌會所建筆款項。主張通知各葉房將是年夏季應送各會員醫師的處方回扣。逕交本會。使各醫無喙爭索。而本會會所可以與建。接治垂成。正宴請各藥房經理之際。牛先生忽到。他考慮之下。以爲如此會所。並非光榮。非但主張取消初步協議。並當塲請各藥房從此取消此項陋規。次日通函會員照辦。余羣岫先生與本人自該日起至今信守未渝。我想會員中從此不受者當亦不在少數。總而言之。彼時吾人共事時精神上的愉快。至今有無窮的回味。　　又記得有一次。我們曾討論到中華民國醫藥學會，中華醫學會·博醫會·醫師公會·全國醫師聯合會。幾個組織的大團結。牛光生私下和我進行疏導工作。曾不惜以種種方法。使幾個短視分子妥洽。以便達成此偉大任務。不意功敗垂成。陡起變化。在當時我表面所見。似乎是某君與某君詞鋒相左。其中一人拂袖離席。然而事後牛先生忘我。「這有人利用派別門戶之存在而高抬自家身分。於是從中難間敎唆而己」。此種事實殊堪髮指。今者牛先生墓木已拱。余蔡汪諸先生亦皆老去。而本人碌碌。也到了鬢霜時候。試問我們醫界消泯派別放棄我見的工作。又做到了什麽程度呢？害羣之馬究竟還有沒有呢？阻礙團結的因素可否消除呢？足以引起分裂的反動會不會日益顯著呢？這些正値得我們今日思考一下了。　　本人自問。在這十餘年中始終受了以往余牛諸君之薰陶。依舊抱着大國結的願望和宗旨。所以抗戰中在後方担任一切工作心至少在我自己主持的機構內。絕未容許有派別門戶的氣味存在。凡是和我同事過的人員。當還可指證。　　但是我在後方時。曾聽說上海淪陷期內。偏多昔日和留日醫師打對壘閙派別的人。反而首先和日本鬼子拉攏起來了。我又看見勝利之後。有人拼命拉同學。擠異黨。不以才取人。但求淸一色。而且所玩範圍。愈弄愈狹。不但僅我同學同派同黨同系。甚且專用同鄉同班。弄得事非其人。成績大壞。如此胸襟。如此氣度。試問派別如何消除。團結如何實現。而工作効能又如何能够發揮呢。所以我們今日在懷念以前那些見地純正的同道之際。不免要大聲疾呼。希望醫界產生無數犧牲小我而完成大我的人物。更應該不留餘地。對利用派別門戶的存在而製造自己地位的野心家。加以制裁。願總明人自己覺醒　寫在龐醫師交後  俊青　　龐醫師此文是一種拉雜的感想，雖然所說的都是關於他代表醫師公會出席市參議會的立場和對於醫師公會往的迴溯以及對於醫師公會的感想，好像對於本刋的讀者沒有什麽直接的關係，而且他的篆鋒所及，似乎觸及了茶些同道的內心，這都是使我們編者非常不安的。然而細按此文的內容，立論非常光明正大，我們正可以看出龐醫師設法維護我們醫界以及衛生行政方面的苦心。我們迴溯過去，思念將來，正應該守着我們自己的崗位，做些我們應做的職務，而不致於像龐醫師所說的「有派別觀念」才好。根據上述的理由，我們就把龐醫師此文發表，我想一般的讀者也許會表示同意的吧。　　至於龐醫師所說的：「在上海淪陷期內偏多昔日和留日醫師打對擂鬧派別的人反爾先和日本鬼子拉攏起來了」一則，雖然沒有指出是啥人，却也不是空穴來風含沙射影的事情。我們很曉得，有些人在上海淪陷時代，曾經和日本鬼子以及一般漢奸之流勾結起來，大搖大擺地做些什麽醫院院長之類，現在居然搖身一變，又身居要職，而且進一步塊又到處揚言要窺竊立法的名位了。這眞是我們醫界裏的大汚點，我們當然不會希望它成爲事實，使它永遠貽羞我們醫界的。而且，我們醫界裏眞正有許多博學多才的無名英雄，鋘而不捨地做他的偉大的醫學工作，無論在學問，道德。或則才幹方面，都要比現在那些兩樓份子强得多多。我們爲什麽不擁護這些學者出來呢？爲什麽要把這些學者埋沒在他的硏究室裏呢？爲什麽這些眞才實學的人不肯出來呢？爲什麽要那些奔走權門的投機份子去張牙舞爪並窺竊名位呢？這一點不但是我們醫界之羞，而且也是我們全體民衆之辱。古書大學裏曾經說過：「十目所視，十手所指，」又說：「千夫所指，無疾而死，」這是民衆的力量，我們希望大家要拿出真衆的力量出來制裁那些投機份子，擁獲那些眞才實學的學者才好。至於那些投機取巧的兩樓份子呢，我們却希望他好好地把尾巴隱藏起來，努力在醫學方面鑽硏，好好地爲民衆做實利的工作，那末不論是對人對已都是有利的。這豈不是兩全其美的事麼？好，不多說了，但願聰明人自己警醒吧！以後也不希望再提及此事了。醫事問答  梁後青醫師主答　　為腸癆療治問題　答慈北葉解無君　　事實經過如下：　　第一次來信（三十六年二月三日）：「鄙人患肺癆已歷六年。肺部的病况並不嚴重。但自前年初春起，不串此病即進展爲胃腸結核，迄今己有二週年。病况眞是嚴重慘苦之極。食東西祇能吃豆腐漿，豆腐，粥，流質的蛋之類。至於菜類有渣滓的東西一概不能下嚥。在些二年中飲食狀况雖有稍些好轉，但亦無甚多大變化。且飲食稍一疏忽，病勢立即加劇。現在試服「使他肺安定」已逾三月。在些三月中病勢有逐漸减輕現象。即如慘苦難受的不適感覺已大减輕，而食慾亦見增加，消化力也有改善。即使稍有吃壞在一一一四天內也能恢復原狀（如在服該藥前吃壞腸胃，則恢復時期約城一二月）。不過嚴重性並未消失，因爲（一）不能吃飯。肉類渣滓不能下嚥。（二）體重减輕不見停止。目下只能吃麪。若麪筋之類必須細嚼後方可下嚥。無熱度。睡眠尙佳。曾試食飯一次，並無消化不良現象。但在第二天後病勢即覺加劇，微有熟度及其他不適感覺。胃腸在平時有顯明的發硬及組糙的感覺。胃部時常作痛，且有空氣儲積。身體極瘦，精神尙好，息神經衰弱症甚爲厲害，諸問有無治愈希望？如有希望當以何藥治之，飲食方面如何調攝？是否須長期禁食粗糙食物？」　　第二次來信，（同年五月四日），「二月前已有一信詢問洽療方法，可惜沒有答覆，因此再函請問：我今年三十歲，患肺癆病已歷六年，初起病况很輕，因誤於庸醫，不着重療養只着車針藥。老是向我說不要緊，不要緊，勿碍勿碍，於是躭誤了。後來曾經打過空氣針二年。結果非但沒有洤愈反爾進展爲胃腸結核。到現在已足足二十七個月了。因爲胃也壞了，所以病况眞是慘苦之極。飲食只能吃流質食物？蛋白質與油質不消化。鷄蛋只能攪在粥裏吃。冲在豆漿內吃就不消化。那時每天主要的食物只限於粥，豆漿，豆腐，鷄汁，鷄蛋這幾種。瀕於死境者不知凡幾，因聞已有特效藥發明了，所以老是咬牙掙扎着苟延殘喘。去年十月間開始服用台灣藥「使他肺安定」。慘苦情形總算稍减。但病况一點也沒有减輕。兩月前在人民醫刊上見有大風子油治咽喉結核的問答，於是就拿中華大風子來服食（去渣微量）。雖然極易損壞腸胃，但極有效。我現在服食大風子末已逾二月，每天服二三次不等。飯後一小時間服之功效更佳，因爲腸胃可以减少感受刺激，到現在爲止我居然已能吃飯。蛋自質及油質的消化情形也改善了許多。本來身體消瘦始終沒有停止的，現在好像已經停止了。不過，腹部總還有些難受的感覺。這種奇特的難受是一言難盡的，雖然現在已經减輕了許多。菜的渣滓還不敢下嚥。油熬的魚西不能吃（如炒蛋，及油條之類）乾燥的也不能吃。從前由胃裏呃出來的東西內常有黑色細小的，傑炭一樣的，像纖維狀東西，就在大便內也常有此。現在大便每天一次，情形還好。每天能吃六碗飯（一天三次）。腸似狹窄。胃部病灶覺已在逐漸縮小。半月前用過一瓶「斯突立妥美新」，功效似乎甚大，它的功用對於病灶部份似與大風子同，不過反應更加厲害而緊張。此藥甚爲昂貴，全部用費約需數千萬元。我的境况不許可我購服此藥，我只好望着這種新發明的東西啼笑皆非而已。我想改變方法治療不知可試用否？將該藥半瓶分作內服，半瓶用作注射。休息一星期後再繼續行之。在內服時注射葡萄糖。休息時服用大風子。該藥治結核性腦膜炎是特效的。我想，我的病症用內服方法當更有效。先生！我是絲毫不愼醫學的，這是我的胡想。對不對呢不請先生解答。答案　　解無先生：在沒有解答你所提出的種種問題以前，我得請你原諒，因爲我們把你二月前的來信擱置到現在才來給你個總答覆。對於解答醫事的問題，我們是盡義務的。在目前人吃人的世界，我們雖然滿懷熱忱地想爲民衆盡些議務，可是爲着生活的問題，我們也得先去忙自己的事情。而且，來信詢問的是無限止的多，篇幅又是這般的小，我們在無可奈何的情况中，只好把許多不必要的間題暫時擱置。今天讀了你的第二次來信，從新又翻出你第一次的來信讀過一遍，覺得很有答覆的價値，因此作了一次總答覆如下。這不單只於你個人有益，而且對於其他的讀者也許有所借鑑吧！　　從你兩次的來信看來，我覺得你的「求生慾」非常大，無論是什麼藥，只要你自己以爲對你是有益的，你就買來試用，不管它究竟有沒有效用，有沒有流弊。（下期續完）妊娠之早期診斷法  蒼龍　　我們醫師對於初期妊娠之診斷方法總覺得不很滿意，因爲我們平常所用Aschheim-Zondech氏妊娠反應試騐以及胎盤素接種試騐之類都不能確定病者是否有孕抑或無孕。我們常常有一種經騐，在某處化騐所裏所做的妊娠反應試騐，結果是有孕而在其他化驗所裏所做的妊娠反應試騐呢抑是無孕。這眞是使我們對於病人方面非常難於應付了。現在幸得有一種新的方法，可以很簡便地解決了這種難題。我現在特此介紹如下：　　美國威司康新的一位醫師Gtossmann氏會經在「西部外科產婦科學報第五十二期報吿，他說曾經在一百個病例中實驗過Prostigmin對於推進月經的功效。僅覺得普羅史特克命不單只有通經之效，而且有診斷初期妊娠之作用。往往有許多婦人會經用Aschheim-Zondeck氏妊娠試騐法認為無孕的，而用普羅史特克命注射之後則認爲有孕，結果在一二個月以後竟能證實其爲妊娠了。反之，如果病者月經過期不至，則經注射上述的普羅史特克命之後正常的月經便來了。此法屬試屢騐、絕對準確不誤。至其試騐手續則非簡單，凡係疑其有孕之婦人，可用普顯史特克命注射一西西於此婦人之肌肉內，每天一次，連續三天。若非懷孕，則月經自至。若已懷孕則月經不至。實在非常簡便。不過我得吿訴讀者，在注射上述藥物時，千萬將針筒向後徵抽，倘有血液流入針筒內，則須將針頭抽出另行注射，以免將藥液注入靜脈內而發生心跳頭暈以及其他不良現象。</p>

<p>春秋記「紅熖市場」　一部法國影片的寫作技巧  李青崖　　　　在中國，尤其在上海，法國影片，是不大被一般留心影片的人士留心的，這現象固然有種種關於商業上的因素，但是另外一個根本上的因素，就是一般人士之愛美國影片正像他們之愛爵士音樂同出於某一類的動機，所以法國影片就和交響音樂一樣，使僅只有少數有志欣賞藝術的人士，才認為那是影片和音樂兩界中自有生命的文化結晶品。　　法國人是世界酷愛藝術的民族，所以他們在綜合藝術的作品裏，格外能够顯出道種精神，當然在他們的影片裏，也不會有例外的現象；以前在中國放映過的法國影片都能够證明此說不廠，而最近在巴黎製成的「紅熖市場」，尤其能說明法國影片的特質。　　「紅熖市塲」也許有會到遠東的機會，現在我不妨把法國人對牠的紀載和批評來介紹於讀者　　一八九七年五月四日，一塲可怖的火災給法國許多名門蒙上了喪服。當日以十分鐘短短的時間，那座慈善百貨商塲在火熖之中化成了灰燼，而一百二十四個在商場裏的士女撞着了摩惡的死神。　　這商塲原是一種義賣。那一年，牠的發起人，在巴黎的約翰古容街的兩個火住宅之間的一方空地上，蓋了一所臨時建築物，來做這養賣營業所。這建築物的裝置全是用木材和布料橏成的，布上養是中古時代兩條街，街上有住宅，有商店；整個建築物有一個塗了松漆寬大的門面和許多向內推關式的門，而屋頂蓋的是塗了柏油的粗帆布。　　營業所是由巴黎許多名門的主婦和少女管理的，就中最有名的是亞朗宋公夫人。所以塲面之富麗自然不必多費詞。而尤其巴黎人士之好奇心受了放映活動影戲的吸引，當時的廣吿稱這活動影戲為「本世紀的奇異發明，能演出眞實人生的幻像，新近內魯意呂米乙先生趕製成功。」　　誰在四日這一天，成千的顧客正在這商場的窄狹過道裏熙來讓往的時候，放映影戲的小廳子裏忽然迸出一聲在呼：救火。　　原來放映的發光體，是一枝用酸化愛太爾火熖燒到白熱的棒狀石灰精，這時候，這套工具爆炸了。不到三五分鐘，火舌吞噬了那幅塗了柏油的帆布，帆布立即坍在那些裝置建築物的木材和布料上面了。這眞是一陣無從描摹的恐怖了。成羣的人向着出口撲過來，但是那些向內推開式的門，反在向外的推送力之下關閉了，因此妨害了那些人從這着火的市塲裏退出來——自進天起，法國的警章就規定公共塲所的門必須向外推開式的。　　另外幾個出口被人好好兒打開了，但是災禍的迅速，熱度的高以及烟霧的濃，都很阻碍了救火的人。　　約莫十分鐘，一切都燒光了。一百一十七個婦人和少女，五個男子和兩個男孩子，都燒成了人炭。　　這意外的災禍敎保爾梅尼乙先生得着造意的靈感了，這位以「情在」和「儼然主人樣的俟從」兩部影片知名的編劇者，在一部名為「紅焰市場」的新片子裏，復現了慈善百貨市場的悲劇場面。　　在　景裏，時代是一八九四年，一個名呌克羅德的渡希米畫家，遇着了一個資產階級的靑年女藝術家亞妮斯。他們的牧歌麼播曾經展到了當年的蒙馬爾特嚴的各種藝術界裏，展到了當年尙在建築中的聖心大敎堂裏，展到了當年以富麗入時的各處咖啡座裏。　　這一對靑年人終於結婚了，克羅德帶着他的妻子時常在上流的娛樂塲出入。但是在亞妮斯始終守着一個被她四週贊許的多才藝術家的崗位的時代，克羅德由於一點兒儌倖的成績受到了誘惑，已經自行商業化並且捲起了蕃布。他為無職業上的嫉妬心，和亞妮斯鬧了好幾次，她終於拋繁了他。　　在這時代裏，慈善商塲的發起人為着充實他們的商品，向克羅德徵求一幅出自亞妮斯之手的油畫、然而這却傷了克羅德的自尊心，所以他只拿出了她的初期作品之一。到了一八九七年五月四日這一天，克羅德走到了古容街來參觀拍。他在塲裏遇見了亞妮斯，並且為着避免一場紛擾，他把她引到了一間更衣室惠關起來。但是火災爆發了，而置身於大起恐怖的羣衆之中的克羅德是不彀强有力的，他沒有能够從火焰之中救出這個遇難的姜子。　　　　他目己固然得救了，但是在四十載的生活之中，他始終悔恨目己當初的行動，末了，他在一九三七年巴黎一家大百百貨公司的火災裏遇見了死神。　　這部片子裏扮演克羅德的下雷讓，身分極其自然，扮演亞妮斯的瑟緋琅漂，可稱初土銀裏的天才。克羅德的同業密友某丁，則由約翰狄西乙担任，確乎能够拽住黏液質的滑稽神韻。　　音樂方面的工作是木里斯狄黎艾担任的，其中的曲譜確能够造出一種極其合於這本悲歡交集劇的種種不同塲面的氣壓。但是這部片子的主要留人力量却是商塲的火災，牠能以一刻鐘的光陰，使那些眞實地得着親歷恐怖和火舌對於生活的印象的般衆都感到了沈痛。　　在佈景之時，梅尼乙和他的合作者竟在攝影塲上，復現了當年慈善百貨商塲的眞切裝置。而上場的配角都是花了精力挑選出來的，因為他們都在當有相當蹻捷才能够從火舌裏平安地逃出來。在法國，這眞是破天荒的第一次。　　恐怖中的某幾個鐘頭都是從這種裝置的某些着了火而立即熄滅的角兒裏攝取的。所以在許多攝影機的在種種攝得着的角度之下紀錄火災的時候，整部的裝置終於都團聚了。　　然而這套裝置，在不到一刻鐘的光陰裏竟葬身火舌了，這正和五十年前的約翰古容街的火災一般無二——那地方現在已經建築了一座紀念牠的敎堂。　　從這影片的本事裏，我們已經看得見編劇者寫作技巧的不凡，至於劇情的排比穿插和塲面的配合乃至於人材的挑選，當然又可以使人看得見牠在藝術上的綜合性了。我很希望我們在上海可以有機會來欣賞牠。夜  黃耘　　孩子：妳喜歡夜嗎？妳不感到夜的恐怖嗎？妳會想像到屬於夜的那些故事和傳奇！　　在這個世界裏，到處是夜的權威；白日也是映着夜的黑暗，而比夜更可怕。　　我們所存在的夜，是白日死去的時候，不，白日該是永遠的死去了。　　孩子：妳在心悸嗎？我已試出妳的手在顫抖得很厲害。妳不要怕，那靑燈映在白　墻上的是我們的影子。妳看燈畔白色的小蛾，將作這光明的祭禮了。誰也是熱愛光明的，然而這世界為什麼太窒息，太凄暗呢？　　打開陳對的木窓吧！看一看外面的夜，是多麼的深沈，妳看：天空陰種得很哪，沒有月亮，也沒有一顆星子；看樣子，是要落雨的。妳看那墻畔的迎春藤和冬靑樹，黑越越的在夜風裏搖動，這風是有一點兒凉，春寒最易傷人的。　　坐下來，靠近我，讓我說一個夜的故事。妳知道黑夜裏的旅人是多麼艱苦的跋涉着他們的步履？在原野，在森林，在山谷……那些古墓的燐火。森林裏的風哨和山谷中狼嗥；路是崎嶇而難行，山谷下是深瀾的急流，一不小心，會滅亡了生命。　　妳說黑夜是多鬼的，但旅者是不會被鬼所迷惑，因為黑夜的魔鬼都很善良，唯有白日的魔鬼那才是非常兇狠的。妳聽過鬼的傳奇吧？鬼是有着比人還真真摯熱烈的感情。　　——在這靑燈下，也許　　的進來一個身影，妳感到可怕嗎？在你冷酷的世界上，是有着比鬼還兇惡的人羣……。　　妳聽：外面落雨了，雨滴不是在敲響了窗子，這夜是太凄凉而寂寞了。好！讓我再給妳譸個雨夜裏幽靈的故事。——在一個像現在一樣的雨夜裏，那是靠近了一片荒塚的古堡，這夜古堡裏宿了一個遠地的旅人。他是跋涉了千山萬水到這裏來。雨夜，他坐在靑燈下着着墻壁上的油畫。這古老的房屋，充滿了神秘與恐怖。突然聽見外面的古塚有細微的哭聲，這時屋角的鐵馬在丁東的饗，窓外的梧桐樹，被風吹雨打的發出了沙沙的聲音。　　外面有了輕輕的步履的聲響，門漸漸的啟開了，伸進一隻巨大的黑手……。　　哦！妳怕嗎？那那麼我不講下去了。妳不要害怕，今夜是不會有鬼來的。　　夜，現在還不曾盡，妳希冀黎明吧，眞的黎明還不會出來的，在夜裏，安靜的生活是幸福的！　　妳聽：外面的雨和更柝，那老更夫的步子不是遠了嗎？…………贈唐雲盡像詩  白蕉　　錢靈秀鍾大石，大石少壯今靈伯；跌宕河山脫形跡，籲墨　戲奪前席；興來古寺靈滿册，嬾至黃金不肯易。送客遂上富陽船，看山　得人是仙；胸中羣本開老禪，筆下神明高時賢；脫手千萬結古歡，夜　無米心常常寬；孝友吾知根天性，議論聞聞及人病；詩不常作才自勝，目低有力心如鏡，先生飲譽畫名盛，讀者萬人俱堪證。我畫先生此為贈，一籲待柝賦比興。（為　雲畫展作）墨竹  柳子谷山村夜宿  宋祝平　　夜晚，寒風又捲起地上晴雪，輕擊着窗紙、燈火晃動在孤寂裏，外面是一望無際的藍色晴空和肅穆的黒夜，一堆殘火厮伴着我，縷縷寂寞之感驀然浮上心頭，周圍是怕人的死靜，寒冷。此刻申該是夜靜更深了吧！　　我還模糊記得：去年也是這個時候，這樣的夜裏。——　　那時，我是正在一個徒步的艱辛的山中旅途上。也是這樣的一個夜晚，我貧戀着趕路，竟錯過了宿站。冬天，剛薄暮，夜色便已悄然襲來，當我還愛戀地望着荒蕪的西山，煊染着夕陽的昏紅的時候，星星早亮滿了天。夜空是充滿優美情調的，可是，山風却　呌着，也是剛晴雪，迎面狂厲的風沙，凜冽的苦冷，我眞有點怕，這一帶正是綠林好漢出沒之所呢。終於，就在這舉目不見人烟的山中，我找到一家小店。你們一定要替我慶幸，是的，當時連我自己也私自深深的慶幸着我的幸遝了。　　我敲開小店的門，這小店統共不過三間房，沒有一個客人投宿，祇有店東自己圍着地下的柴火坐着，一股暖氣迎着我，牆角點着滲慘淡的一采油燈。這些使我忘了小店是如何的卑陋，依着牆靠下我的行杖，把我僅有的小行李扔到土坑上，於是，我拍拍身上的塵土，坐在店東的對面，也凑近了火。　　我們默默的坐着，誰也沒有想起說話，祇有乾柴小聲的爆裂，點綴着空氣的冷漠。我埋着頭祇顧烤火，一直到我全身暖了，我抬起頭，我簡直要驚呆了，店東是在不住狠狠的盯着我。他穿一件藍棉襖，頭上是一頂舊毡帽，滿臉　髭，鐵靑的臉被熊熊的柴火映照着成了慘悲的綠色了，眼睛眨滿血絲，銳利的目光我像在什麼不平常的地方見過。頓時，我不禁打了一個寒噤，心情緊張頁不安的想：他是幹殺人越貨勾當的吧！那麼，我是投進黑店了，眼前一黑，盡是些殘忍，冷酷，　辣，塗染成一幅血的圖畫　　又默默了一陣之後，我抑制住心跳，避開他的視綫，小心的開始跟他搭訕起來，打聽着他一些不關要緊的事，他祇用鼻音哼着。最後，當他顯的有點疲倦的打呵欠的時候，我故意的在無意中吿訴他：『後面還有我們一隊拉拉軍（註），如果前面在早上趕不上打尖，，明天早飯怕要在你這兒了。』　　這回他終於開口了：「是明天早晨便到？」這聲音有點像受傷的野獸嘶呌，我極怕聽這種聲昔，胆怯的同他點點頭，心裏一陣抖嗦的發麻，我們又沉默了。　　當我將睡之前，躺在土坑上時，故意對他露了露我簡單的破行李，他獻殷勤的在土坑裏又為我塡進一把燃着的麥草。一夜，我是懷着不安的心情迷朦的醒着，躺在灼熱的土坑上反覆的聽着北風捲起晴雪輕擊着窗紙，恐懼的想：他該不會打我的主意吧?　　第二天，星星還挺亮的，上弦月窈窕的掛在東方樹梢，我便匆匆爬起來，離開小店，背起我的小行李，又開始我山中的行程了。我在滿是凍雪的崎嶇的山道上走了二十里，在另一個山頭上，我欣喜的迎着了黎明，東方發白，朦朧中還閃着耀眼的金光。　　太陽出來時，在和煦的陽光裏我的心也溶化了，昨夜，實在是一場噩夢，而我也開始說了一個謊，對着初陽，，不住笑起我的神經過敏了。　　（註）是一種用三個或　　四個牲口所拉的膠皮輪大車，在西北幾乎是較卡車還重要的運輪工具。　　啟　本刊所載「寸山河一寸血」，以作者事冗，續稿一時不及撰寫，囑暫停數日，特為聲明。　春秋編輯室謹啟夜聲  韋曉萍　　在日常生活之中，含有比在大事變的悲劇更深刻的悲劇分子。——梅脫靈克：　　我是最怕過這夜間的，　　一看到夜的脚步踏上頭來，全身就冷了半截，儘抑不住的那股泂蕩起伏的愄惘和　惑的滋味　　夜　的窗前，不時有一種哀吿似的聲音飄過，曾經誘發了我這漂泊者的鄕愁。但我每常想到故鄉「綠豆粥」的呌聲，在四川的時候也有「炒米糖開水」的呌賣，那是令人多麼低徊忘不了的夜聲呢，現在却換成：　　「五香鷄蛋」！　　我不敢說這聲音一定好聽或者不好聽，但我總覺得過於凄厲，凄厲很使人難以久聽下去，像從前一個外國傳敎士在廣州所聽到的：「賣——鹹！沙！梨」如思如慕如泣如訴，就不禁湧起一片惻隱同情之心。　　只是今夜，我却沒有聽到這聲音。　　外面又起了風了。卜卜地，從曲蒼牆壁激迥的風的旋流，一陣陣鞭打着門窗，還驚起一聲聲的狗吠。狗似乎是已經警覺着什麼，她像正接了過去，在汪地發狠的吠着繼而又退回來嗚嗚地低哼着，然後又猛襲向前去……　　我靜不下來，心忐忑不寗的跳，猜想：「這該出亂子吧？」　　悄悄地推開窗，夜是一面汹湧着黑霧暗沉沉的海，張開了大口，吞噬着一切，甚而我，連我的眼睛。僅有一星光亮，從巷口透射進來，慘綠色的，在閃動擴大是憐火？螢光？　　幾聲單調的脚步，又一陣緊急的狗呌。　　「喂，是人是鬼」？我伸頭出去提高嗓子喊　　「唔？」窗外氣憤的答話。「自然是人」。　　「幹什麼的」？　　「賣五香鷄蛋」！　　「啊！是你，你幹嗎不喊」？我倒歡然了，像飄流了若干年茫茫的大海，又碰見故人。但轉一想：「賣鷄蛋的，你病了」？前晚，我向他買的時候，那穿得襤褸的衣衫，兩隻眼睛陷下去，聲音是嘶啞的，我就覺得這個人人是會被生活磨折盡了的。　　我想到說不出的悽愴，順腿走出門去，像沉在冰　裏，只好透過喉頭的重壓掙扎出來了欷歔　　「病了嗎」？我問。　　他搖搖頭。　　「那你幹什麼不喊」？　　他指了指巷道外，那裏像安放有一對，夜鷹的眼睛的，會使這些無事的人顫慄。他就說：「他們不讓我作聲」。　　「出了亂子嗎？怪不得狗呌的緊」。　　他倒笑了，冷冷地笑着：「那裏他們說是要兜捕壞人……夜裏出來的壞不，」　　我有點有懂。　　他只眨貶眼睛，隨後又落下一個沉痛的歎息：「沒辦法啊。誰不為了生活。你看我先生，我們一家老的老，小的小，全靠掙這點錢過活，夜啦，亂啦，壞人啦，全不過是……」。　　「碰」！一聲槍響！狗更大呌起來。　　許多雜沓的脚步奔跑，「抓住抓住」。有人喊，一個突起的女人哭呌聲又把那淹沒了。　　「他們算又捕到壞人了！男的？女的？唉，唉！」。賣鷄蛋的反顯見得平靜了。他彎下腰擰了下燈頭，火熖就隨着升高，燈光中我又看見那呆滯得失掉了人的活氣的面孔啊。　　我忍不住鼓動的說：「這你就可以入開喉嚨呌賣了」。　　他說：「難得很，難得很，夜裏的事是說不定的。」　　他走了，艱難地移着脚步，走過去了。　　我睜大眼，這夜裏。自由談	陪都北溫泉之夏  彭德漢　　「北溫泉」是陪都郊區勝景之一，是有名的「四大溫泉」中景緻最美麗的，三年前，達官貴人和富商巨賈，幾乎都到這兒避暑，在北泉公園上那一棟棟修築得美麗的洋樓，就是昔日的遺跡。三十二年的重慶夏令營，也是在「北泉」的綠陰深處。　　縉靈山在它底上面，碧琉璃一樣的嘉陵江切斷了縉雲山脈，而夾流於千仭壁立的懸岩之下；水底的石牙，江上的谷風，鼓盪起洶湧的波濤，波濟拍着崇旁的石塊，和山嶺的松籟，潛鳴的溫泉，交奏着無盡之歌，夾岸紅桃的倒影，襯在碧流下崢嶙的白石上，映着裏搖不定的飛舞姿態。西部中部因為岩石塌入江中，成為凹入數十畝大的台地，南北兩端與東岸岩壁相抱，而形成了這斐聲西南的美景—北溫泉。　　翠綠的松柏，幻成了一層黛色天鵝絨的帳幕，異草奇花，僚圖案一般地平舖在這美景上，而圍繞於紅牆綠瓦，雕梁畫棟的宮殿廟宇之側，和玲瓏的亭榭之間，走在筆柏夾立的甬道中，或躺在綠茵芊綿的草坪上，仰看着那湛藍而無際的天空，飄着幾朶浮雲，斜陽的紅光，射在那白色的邊端，成為金黃的鑲條，天空中種種變幻的美景，映着北泉之夏，使遊人們對這情景，泛起了一個不忍離去的情感。　　溫泉池中溫泉浴室係北泉公園管理處所創辦，遊人如梭在北泉公園之下，緊鄰着嘉陵江，是一棟利用廟宇改建的新型沐浴所，門首題有「滌塵」二字，以少為名，實非常的恰當。沐浴處分成三部：單人間。內池。外池，單人間的浴票五百元，而露天游泳池的外池僅需二百五十元，和狂漲的物價對照一下，確是一個平民化，大衆化的樂園。　　若干遊人在攀登北泉公園高處的白鳥亭，由鎭瓦殿旁治石級而登，站在白鳥亭上，你可以體悟到「蜀山水碧蜀山菁」的詩句，你會底覺到北泉山水之偉大，柔媚；你底情感，會寄託到靑」上，寄託到綠水上，你可以很淸楚地看到靑山絲水間的北泉公園，花開花謝，公園變成了一個四季變換的岡案畫，亭上有于右任院長題的「靑山綠水白鳥亭」七個字。　　黃昏，只有在黃昏，才是北溫泉上最値得留戀的一刻，任何地方，都是一個最　得留戀的美麗鏡頭，尤其是在大佛殿旁的愛邀池上，坐在那碎綠色的碎柳，深紅色的鮮花，團繞的半山半水的小島上，什麼雜念都會被美景冲去，什麼愁慮，都會飄化到遺遠的天際。縉養山嶺雲烟繞繞，嘉陵江上浪花濤濤，在縉雲山下嘉陵江畔的北溫泉，却正是「夏」底天國，「夏」底樂園，炎夏使整個陪都城罩在悶人的氣氛裏，炎夏溫泉。却不能統治陪都北郊的北溫泉。月球秘密  虛人　　月球中的一切本是一個秘密，但由於科學的進步，這秘密已逐漸的揭開了。　　月球上根本沒有空氣，一個人從地球上來到月球中，他馬上受體內壓力的壓迫而發生爆炸。　　凡是地球上的東西，許多在月球上也月譬如沙漠·草原·山脈和火山等，只是沒有一切生物·海洋·江河，連一滴水也找不到。　　月球上的一個白天等於地球上的兩個星期之長，它的夜晚也和地球上兩星期一樣長。月球上的晝夜溫度相差極大，太陽射到地球上是要經過大氣層，但太陽射到月球上却是直接的，所以正午時，如果把一壺冰水放在月球中受日光照射的岩石上，一兩分鐘內就可沸騰，這時月球中如有人類，只有躱在日光不能到達的岩洞內。一到夜晚，月球的熱度加速地放射到空中，溫度降低得使任何液體都可化成冰塊，這時的人只有穿着絕緣性質的衣服才能活下去。　　月球表面所受到的「月心吸力」，只有地球所受的地心吸力的五分之一，因此在地球上的一切物件，來到月球上後就會减少五分之四的重量，譬如一個兩百磅重的人，到了月球上就只有四十磅了。　　人類在未來是能够到月球中去了，交通工具可能是火箭，不過，載人到月球去的火箭，其發動機必須用原子能為燃料，火箭飛行的速度必須達到每秒鐘十英里。月球與地球之間的平均距離約二干萬英里，用這樣的火箭裝載人到月球去，只要三四天便可到達月球。　　今日世界上最貴重的金屬是像「鈾」這種稀少的東西，但是據科學家的探究，由於月球中岩石和地層構造的特殊，月球上埋藏了大量的鈾鑛和其他放射性金屬，所以將來可以在月球上大量的利用原子能來建造城市，使月球上能够居住人類。譬如利用原子能從月球中的礦物中提取氧氣，氫氣，氮氣，供給空氣和水源，利用原子能供給暖氣和光，並且調節大氣溫度。　　如能控制月球，在軍事上也就可以完全控制着整個地球，因為「月心吸力」比地心吸力小了五分之四，從月球上可以用火前炸彈轟炸地球上的任何一個地方，很方便，描準力很準確，破壞的程度非常之大，但是如要從地球上去轟炸月球，却是困難了千百倍，因為地心吸力比月心吸力大了五倍。所以在未來的原子時代中，野心的武力侵略者不但要控制地球上的重要戰略區域，還會設法佔據月球，作為征服全世界的根底呢。中日之間  苞卿　　中國一一濟南慘案」的十九週年紀念日，麥師准許日本政府官署，國會和皇宮，自此以後可重新掛日本國旗。　　日本紀念一二八淞滬戰後中的「肉彈三勇士」的銅像，仍屹立着。　　東京靖國神社中的我國國恥紀念品中，只取回了錨鍊和砲彈，錨兩具則尙在洽運中。還若其他的我國軍器如將軍砲，又龍旗，海軍公所圖額及地方官德政碑等，尙不知其下落　　食鹽是工業上的主要原料，我國食鹽大量輸日，是應麥帥顧盧民食的要求。而麥帥且准日本中國海捕魚和恢復紡織業，是侵害我國淮業，阻滯中國紡織業。李燭　氏說；不啻以中國人民之乳哺育侵略中國之虎。　　遠東國際軍事法庭上，中美英蘇等十一國控訴日本一級戰犯公訴書，列五十四罪狀，其有　中國者，共十八件，內：謀靳東亞太平洋印度洋一件，陰謀侵略我國者舟二一件，發動對我國侵略者四件，攻擊我國地方並實行　殺者六件，藐視國際公法險謀或執行或不防止殺害或　待戰俘，平民者四件。關懷祖國  劉夢　　六日檳榔嶼華僑致申報轉全國同胞一電關懷祖國迭起的學潮，情股意深。美　　國汎美航空公司中美航綫第一次客機又帶來了舊金山華僑獻國父墓前的花圈。一封電文，一個花圈，値不了什麼，但其含義却很深，充分顯出華僑對祖國的愛。　　華僑的關懷祖國是很熟切的，一方面是因我國人鄕土之戀本極深，古人也有「遠托異國，昔人所悲」的話；一方面還是為了　　自身在海外所受不平等的待遇，是以　治之心比誰也深切。羅斯福的遺產  阿林　　六日本報紐約電，故羅斯福遺產管理人，今日向蘇浴蓋特法院提出淸算報吿，羅斯福于一九四五年四月十二日逝世時，遺產價値為一百九十四萬美元，其中九十九萬美金是其母還產所得，因淸償債務及其他費用，實際總額現為一百四十三萬美金。　　這是羅斯福這作為近世偉人的一筆財產，除了遺傳所得，他一生的經營所得不過四十萬美金而已，這比諸美國六十大家的財富數字，眞是微乎其微。大慨在這里「仕而優則富」，在東方是一種規則，在羅斯福，則失意其意義。　　由此，也可見偉者與庸人的分野，庸人終身從事于一己的私利，所以他所遺留的是巨大的財富，而偉者所從事的是人羣的大事業，它的遺產因此也是對人類的貢獻和對世界的建樹。所以，四中萬美金的遺產，（這裏面如果减去其太夫人遺產的常年利息數，還不足此數遠甚）是並不足道的。在羅斯福，是有更大的遺產在。　　這筆遺產就是我們所稱道的對人類的貢獻和對世界的貢獻。在本世紀，我們感到二次大戰戰出了兩個光輝的結果來，一是民族自決是一九一九年威爾遜總統的建樹，一是經濟的。Democracy羅斯福總統的先見。以經濟民主，來安定世界，這是羅斯福的事業，也是他繼留給這個世界的大事業。至于前此之促進國際團結，這在今日國際混沌之局勢中，我們更覺得羅斯福的偉大所在　　眞唯經濟的Democracy，所以羅斯福遺留的財富僅及美國六十大家的尾數，眞唯其為一代人物，所以它所遺留給這個世界的是促進安定和平和繁榮的事業，這事業是比一筆財富更有繼承的必要與價値。談胡展堂  許仁　　革命元　胡展堂先生已經逝世十一年了，使人對這位大政治家，致予無限的懷念。　　先生名呌「漢民」，是因為當滿淸末年，先生正追隨國父從事革命，他想滿淸是胡人，而他自己的姓恰恰是「胡」，他引為恥辱之事，但姓又不可更改，于是自取名曰「漢民」，表示自已是漢家子民：　　他在立法院長任內時，京滬毘鄉，每逢星期六，首都要人紛紛前往上海小作休憇，已經成為習慣，當時與論稱之為「週末旅行」，只有胡光生在國府建都南京後，五六年中從未去過上海，一直到二十年解識經滬去粵，這是他建都後的第一次到上海，也是他末次到上海，因為他以後便在廣州逝世了。　　他痛恨在中國大都巿有殖民地式的外國租界存在。因此他一生脚步從來沒有踏進過租界一步，這和吳佩孚氏的「失敗後不托庇租界居住」的信條，互相暉映。　　某太太以三十元買了一雙外國絲機，在當時物價下是非常奢侈的行為，被胡先生知道了，在中央紀念週上特別提出此事，痛斥了一頓。一時傳為佳話。　　胡先生和汪精衛同是國民黨的元老，但胡汪之間不相融洽，胡先生素鄙視汪氏的人格，二十年胡氏由京去粵，道經上海，汪精衛恰恰也從國外回到上海，分別數年的胡汪握手相見；汪別去後，胡氏亟呼人取盆盛水洗手，說：「汚了我的手」！汪精衛後來投降日本做了漢奸，足證胡先生的識人不虛。　　國府四元老，都以字名于時，便是胡展堂，于右任，譚延　，鈕永建四人。他們的字體各有不同的風格，胡氏的字瘦峭挺拔，硬骨稜稜，字如其人，看了他的字就會述想到他為人行事的骨氣。北泉全景大佛殿傍之筆松愛運池　茀里亞斯坦在「美艷親工」中危城記  秦瘦鷗　　就用這樣多方哄騙的方法老祝又跟她度日如年般的消磨了一小時光景，好容易盼到火車又在一偶呌做關西的很小的小站上停下了，許多比較壯健的客人都陸續跳下車去走動歇息，祝兆年雖然很知道這一條樹校似的橫木的可貴，一離開可能就給別人搶了去，但為了緋緋的病，他覺得必須趕快帶她下去吸一些新鮮空氣，同時他還想找團裏有幾個稍微有些醫學常識的同伴來看一看，究竟這孩子害的是什麼病，會不會也像她媽一樣的染上了斑疹傷寒？　　他毅然走下了火車。這時候，那位姓馮的團員已端來了一碗滾燙的開水，老祝抱着緋緋先在沒有篷的站台上席地坐了下去，一面呌他把開水放在旁邊，一面就請他趕快去找導那幾個懂得一些醫理的團員　　現在，緋緋只是昏昏欲睡，乎心和前額都熟得有些燙手，老祝也知道這決不是一場小病，但他除掉盡量灌開水給她喝以外，一時實在想不出再有什麼好的辦法。關西這地方只是一個極小極小的小村落，車站附近，也不過三四家人家，全住着又矮又窄的小屋子，連個店鋪都沒有，怎麼會有藥房或醫院的可能呢？　　當他正在竭力思索的時候，鐵路上的職員和搭車的人已經全知道火車暫時不能再開了，因為前面的軌道上才有一綱軍用車出軌，鐵路局正派着小工在搶修，可是什麼時候能修好，訛也不知這！而同時車站上的人還在紛紛議論，都說桂林柳州的失守業已證實，謠傳日本兵已攻入宜山，金城江也到了便衣隊。　　這些消息無異又在祝兆年的頭上澆了一桶冷水。</p>

<h3>The Government Decides to Expedite Resolution of the Xinjiang Incident Through Diplomatic Channels; Minister Bai Is Dispatched Immediately for Handling</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] The central government has decided to send Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi as a high-ranking official to Xinjiang. On the 12th, at 8:30 AM, the Chairman summoned Mr. Bai and gave instructions on handling the issue of Outer Mongolian troops invading Xinjiang. After meeting the Chairman, Mr. Bai originally intended to depart that afternoon, but after receiving another telegram from Xinjiang, which required further instruction from the Chairman, he decided to postpone his departure, which is now likely to occur on the 13th or 14th. Mr. Bai's flight itinerary to Xinjiang is set; after leaving Nanjing, he will first fly to Xi'an, where he will rest briefly before transferring to Lanzhou. After an overnight stay in Lanzhou, he will fly to Dihua. It is rumored that he will stay there for one or two weeks.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie and Defense Minister Bai Chongxi, during a temporary meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the afternoon of the 12th, explained the government's attitude toward the recent Xinjiang incident. Both emphasized that the government would first use diplomatic and peaceful means to seek an early resolution to the incident, while implying that the nation's territorial sovereignty would not be compromised. Bai Chongxi also reported that the authorities had telegraphed Zhang Zhizhong, the Director of the Northwest Headquarters, instructing the local garrison to fulfill its duty to defend the territory. The temporary meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 12th was convened at the suggestion of legislators such as Guang Lu, requesting that the foreign and military authorities attend the meeting to explain the truth about the Xinjiang incident. It was originally planned to have President Zhang attend, but due to other commitments, only Foreign Minister Wang Shijie and others reported. Wang's report first analyzed the internal and external situation and the recent developments, pointing out that the cause of the incident was quite complex, and to understand the truth, it was necessary to obtain accurate information first. He then reported on the government's adopted attitude, stating that the government had protested to both the Soviet and Mongolian sides. The protest to the Soviet Union concerned Soviet aircraft covering Outer Mongolian military actions, which was deemed an unfriendly act and a violation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. The protest to Mongolia concerned the invasion. As of now, no response has been received. The government will deal with this matter with a calm and firm attitude, hoping to resolve it peacefully through diplomatic channels, and hopes that the legislators will trust the government. Some legislators inquired whether a complaint could be filed with the United Nations regarding this matter. Wang stated that there was no need for this at present.</p>
<p>The Authorities Telegraph the Garrison to Fulfill Their Duty to Defend the Territory</p>
<p>Bai Chongxi reported, emphasizing that the government has always treated people peacefully and that this matter can be resolved diplomatically. However, soldiers have a duty to defend the territory, and the authorities have telegraphed Zhang Zhizhong, instructing his troops to fulfill their duty to defend the territory, as the other side has put forward the slogan of "recovering lost territory," while the Altai region is indeed our country's territory. Many legislators spoke enthusiastically during the meeting, hoping that weak diplomacy would not be adopted again in the future. The meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Nanjing, 12th] A certain member of the Legislative Yuan pointed out that the fundamental reason for the conflict between China and Outer Mongolia is that there is no boundary line at the border between China and Outer Mongolia, which is a "loophole" in diplomacy. If the boundary line is not demarcated, border disputes will continue to arise. Therefore, the government should start demarcating the boundary line with Outer Mongolia as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] Xinjiang's position is important, and diplomatic negotiations are numerous. It is necessary to strengthen the institution and enrich the talent to cope with the situation. When the Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs and Legal Affairs Committees recently reviewed the "Revised Draft of the Organization Law of External Commissioners' Offices," they all agreed that Xinjiang should be reorganized into a Class A Commissioner's Office. The proposal was passed at the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the morning of the 12th.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] It is rumored that Soviet Ambassador to China, Petrov, plans to return to his country for consultations soon, and that the embassy affairs will be handled by Counselor Fedorenko.</p>
<h3>Participating Councilors Concerned About the New Situation; Suggest Convening an Emergency Meeting; Shao Lizi Advocates Expressing an Attitude After Understanding the Truth</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] Resident councilors of the National Political Council, such as Yin Shuxian, are concerned about the invasion of Xinjiang by Outer Mongolian troops and believe that to protect the country's territorial integrity, the National Political Council, standing in the position of the people, should express its attitude on this matter. They have specifically suggested to the Secretariat of the National Political Council to convene a temporary meeting of the resident councilors to discuss this issue. Secretary-General Shao Lizi believes that an attitude can be expressed after understanding the truth of the matter. Yin told reporters on the evening of the 12th, "In this turbulent world situation, this incident has suddenly occurred. We sincerely hope that the government can handle it carefully to avoid affecting world peace."</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] Zuo Shunsheng and Yu Jiaju of the Youth Party stated on the 12th regarding the Xinjiang incident: The Youth Party's shock at this matter is the same as the shock of all sectors of society at this matter. However, they do not intend to comment until the correct information regarding this matter arrives. They all believe that this matter must be supported by other parties, so they attach great importance to it.</p>
<p>Jiang Yuntian of the Social Democratic Party arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 12th. Regarding the Xinjiang issue, he only said: Before obtaining more information, he does not want to make any comments on this matter, but hopes that this matter will proceed through diplomatic channels and will not be further expanded.</p>
<h3>City Council and Other Groups Telegraph the Government to Protect Rights</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The City Council, City Chamber of Commerce, General Labor Union, City Farmers' Association, City Fishermen's Association, City Education Association, and City Local Association of this city are all indignant at the invasion of Xinjiang by Outer Mongolian cavalry. They have jointly telegraphed Chairman Chiang, requesting that a serious protest be lodged with the Soviet and Mongolian authorities as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Tianjin, 12th] The Tianjin Provisional Council held a meeting on the 12th and decided to telegraph the government, requesting it to take effective measures to stop the Outer Mongolian troops' invasion of Xinjiang.</p>
<p>[Report from This City] The Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters issued a telegram on the 12th, stating: Outer Mongolian cavalry, under the cover of aircraft with Soviet markings, attacked the troops stationed at Beitashan in Xinjiang, which is tantamount to a re-enactment of the "September 18th Incident." It hereby represents all party members in the city, telegraphed to the whole country, demanding that the government, on the one hand, lodge a serious protest with the invading countries through diplomatic means, and order them to withdraw their troops, apologize, and compensate for the losses; and on the other hand, quickly dispatch a large army to strictly block them to maintain the sovereignty of the territory and protect peace in the Far East.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Wang Zhuyi, Secretary-General of the National Diplomatic Association, made a statement on the invasion of Xinjiang by Outer Mongolian troops, hoping that the people of the whole country would heighten their vigilance and at the same time hope that the Soviet government and people would no longer disregard the common will of the Chinese people.</p>

<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Wu Yun, Chairman of the Industrial Association, expressed his feelings about the Xinjiang incident, saying that the Soviet Union has its own consistent policy towards Xinjiang Province, and past history can prove it. This incident gives people a sense of "September 18th" all over again. Those who insult themselves are always insulted by others. We should be deeply vigilant.</p>
<p>[Another Report] After learning that the Mongolian army attacked Xinjiang under the cover of Soviet aircraft, the industrial circles of this city felt very indignant. The General Labor Union is drafting a telegram to be sent to the Chairman and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, demanding a strong response to protect national rights.</p>
<p>Students of Guanghua University in this city were filled with grief and indignation after seeing reports that the Soviet Air Force had covered the Outer Mongolian troops in invading more than 600 li of the territory of Xinjiang Province. The school's Lixing Society convened representatives from various student groups of the school at 10:00 AM yesterday to formally establish the Guanghua University Anti-Soviet Aggression Association. Resolutions such as telegraphing the government to take strong and effective measures were passed.</p>
<h3>U.S. Troops Withdraw from Tianjin; First Batch Has Been Opened</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Beiping, 12th] The first batch of U.S. Marines departed by truck on the 12th to go to Tanggu to board transport ships to return to the United States. The U.S. Marine Corps headquarters in Tianjin did not announce how many people had departed, but it is generally speculated that one-third of the 1,500 officers and soldiers of the First Division of the U.S. Marine Corps have been scheduled to completely withdraw from Tianjin within ten days. The second and third batches are scheduled to leave China by ship on the 16th and 19th of this month.</p>
<h3>Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, Li Wenfan, Assumed Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] Li Wenfan, Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, officially assumed office at 9:00 AM on the 12th. The inauguration ceremony was very simple. First, President Ju introduced him to all colleagues, and then Li made a speech, stating: (1) After the abolition of unequal treaties, the Judicial Yuan's responsibility is even more important. (2) With the Constitution about to be implemented, the judiciary is the center of a country ruled by law, and the work of this Yuan will be even more arduous. He will follow the guidance of the President and work together with all colleagues. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Listens to Reports, Guides the Course of the Student Protests; Rejects Amendment to the Number of Legislative Yuan Occupational Representatives</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] The Legislative Yuan held its 327th regular meeting on the morning of the 12th, presided over by President Sun Jian, with more than 90 legislators in attendance. They first listened to Liu Ke's report on the nine legislators ordered to guide the course of the student protests, and Wan Dianwu, a representative of the Wuhan University petitioners, reported on the truth of the tragic incident at the school. Thirteen important proposals were discussed at the meeting, of which ten were passed. Important ones included the Organization Law of the Ministry of Health, the Amendment to the Civil Servant Retirement Law, and the Amendment to the Civil Servant Compensation Law. The Amendment to the Legislative Yuan Organization Law was resolved to be referred to the Legal Affairs Committee for further research on how to enrich the powers of the Legislative Yuan due to personnel and budget reasons.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the number of occupational representatives in the Legislative Yuan, it was raised at the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 12th. Because the procedure for the submission of the proposal by the National Defense Committee was not in compliance, it was resolved to return the original proposal to the National Government. After the proposal was raised in the Yuan today, Liu Ke, Chairman of the Legal Affairs Committee, first reported on the research results, stating: The Legal Affairs Committee and other committees were ordered to research whether the "Proposal for Reconsideration of the Number of Legislative Yuan Occupational Representatives" submitted by the National Defense Supreme Committee complied with the reconsideration procedure. The research results showed that the number of Legislative Yuan occupational representatives had already been announced, and the word "reconsideration" in the original text had no basis in current law. If it is a reconsideration, it is not in compliance with the procedure. Is it possible to consider it as an amendment? Then, legislators spoke, and they could be roughly divided into two factions. Lin Bin, Chen Hong, and others believed that the time for holding elections was rushed, and the main intention of the document was to increase the number of representatives, not to reconsider the entire proposal, so it could be considered as an amendment. Lu Fu, Liu Tong, Chen Ruli, and others firmly believed that it was not in compliance. Lu Fu pointed out that if the government intended to amend this proposal, it could be decided by the government itself and then submitted to the Yuan for amendment. The Legislative Yuan could not open the door for convenience. As for the delay in time, the fault lies with the government, and the Legislative Yuan cannot be responsible for it on its behalf. Luo Ding explained that if time was insufficient, an emergency meeting could be convened, which could not be a reason. Finally, the review opinion "Can it be considered an amendment?" was put to a vote. Of the 94 people present, only 24 voted in favor. The proposal was rejected, and the original proposal was returned to the National Government. Also at the meeting on the 12th, the table of allocation of the number of National Assembly representatives was discussed, and it was resolved to refer it to the Constitutional Law Committee for further organization because there were still problems with the allocation of the number of representatives in Guangxi, Sichuan, Gansu and other provinces.</p>
<h3>Xinjiang National Army Resists Bravely; Beitashan Has Been Recaptured; Soviet-Marked Aircraft Continue Bombing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 12th] Our Beitashan garrison, under heavy attack by Outer Mongolian cavalry in coordination with multiple military vehicles, retreated once on the 6th after bravely resisting, and counterattacked on the morning of the 7th, recapturing Beitashan. The two sides are still in a stalemate. During the fighting in recent days, military aircraft have continued to assist the Outer Mongolian army in combat.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] News from the front line of Beitashan: On the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th, military aircraft with Soviet markings continued to bomb the positions of the National Army.</p>
<h3>The Right to Interpret the Constitution Should Belong to the Judicial Yuan</h3>
<p>People in Judicial Circles in Beijing Express Their Views</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] Regarding the right to interpret and explain the Constitution, according to Article 78 of the Constitution, it is exercised by the Judicial Yuan. The Judicial Yuan will establish a Grand Justices Conference with nine Grand Justices within days to exclusively handle the right to interpret the Constitution. However, the National Government has recently established a "Drafting Committee for the Explanation of the Constitution," which judicial circles here believe seems to conflict with the provisions of the Constitution. In the shortest period of time, an opinion will likely be published and some arguments made. Also, the Legislative Yuan expressed dissatisfaction with the National Government's organization of the Constitution Explanation Committee. It is said that when the Constitutional Law Committee recently met, it decided not to participate in this work.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] Zhang Junmai of the Social Democratic Party arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 12th. Zhang came to Beijing this time to attend the meeting of the Drafting Committee for the Explanation of the Constitution to discuss various points of the Constitution that have raised doubts and need to be resolved, and to decide on the personnel allocation of the seven groups for drafting the explanation. The meeting is about to be held. Secretary-General Lei Zhen is currently staying in Shanghai and will return to Beijing within days. Also, after Zhang Junmai arrived in Beijing, Chen Cheng, Shao Lizi, and others visited him, and Zhang also visited Vice Chairman Sun Ke and others, with whom he had meetings.</p>
<h3>Conducting Election Issues</h3>
<p>Sun Ke and Zhang Junmai Confer</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] Sun Ke hosted a dinner for Zhang Junmai, Wang Shijie, and others on the 12th, and had a meeting after the meal. Zhang said to reporters that the issues discussed today were mostly about the conduct of the election, and it has now been decided to hold it as scheduled. Zhang believes that the implementation of the Constitution can be realized in stages, but every article that is implemented must be genuine. Zhang believes that the Xinjiang incident should still be resolved through diplomatic channels, and Zhang is scheduled to meet with the Chairman on the 14th.</p>
<h3>Improving Wheat and Rice Seeds; Zuo Shunsheng Says the Ministry of Agriculture Is Researching It</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] Zuo Shunsheng said on the 12th regarding the work of the Ministry of Agriculture: The only current goal is the eight characters "improve production and increase production." He also said: After the large-scale import of foreign rice, food can be guaranteed not to panic again, and grain prices will naturally tend to fall. Zuo also said: The Ministry of Agriculture is currently researching improved seeds, and it plans to research more than 20 types of improved wheat seeds and more than 30 types of rice seeds to increase production. According to not very precise statistics, before the war, China's food production offset the country's total consumption, lacking only 3%. After the war, it was only 5% or 6%. However, currently, it is only because transportation is poor and there are not enough means of transportation that there is no way to adjust whether there is any. Purchasing foreign rice is to relieve the panic when the old harvest is exhausted and the new harvest is not yet in. Now this opportunity is about to pass. Since becoming the Minister of Agriculture, Zuo has been buried in research and planning.</p>
<h3>The Dalian-Lushun Inspection Group Returns to Shenyang Early</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 12th] The Dalian-Lushun Inspection Group stayed in Lushun for a week. It is said that because they encountered problems that could not be resolved, they shortened their stay. They have now left Lushun and are sailing to Huludao, and may return to Shenyang on the 13th or 14th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] According to sources concerned, the news published by the Tianjin Soviet-Russian Daily on May 12 regarding the issue of Chinese administration in Dalian, which stated: The Chinese government has not yet responded to the Soviet government's request to establish the naval base area of Lushun and the administrative power of Dalian as soon as possible in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, is clearly inconsistent with the facts.</p>
<p>It is understood that in October of the 34th year of the Republic of China, our government planned to send troops to land in Dalian to defend the Northeast and to take over Dalian and Lushun. The other side disagreed with our side sending troops to land in Dalian. At that time, it was also reported that there were anti-government forces in the suburbs of Dalian and Lushun, so the administrative personnel sent by our side to the Dalian-Lushun area have not been able to go to establish administrative power. Regarding the letter from the Soviet Ambassador on March 7th of this year, it is understood that our side replied on March 31st of the same month. The reply stated the specific measures for our establishment of administrative power in Dalian and Lushun. After repeated negotiations with the Soviet side on this matter, the Soviet side consistently opposed our troops entering Dalian and Lushun to maintain the security and freedom of our administration. We have now sent personnel to Dalian and Lushun to inspect the situation in order to prepare for the restoration of our administrative power in the area.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Will Accelerate Economic Aid to China; London Pays Attention to the Invasion of Xinjiang by Outer Mongolian Troops</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 12th] Reliable sources here believed on the 12th that if the Soviet Union's instigation of Outer Mongolian troops to invade Xinjiang can be confirmed, the United States will accelerate its economic assistance to the Chinese government. Secretary of State Marshall and other State Department officials are now planning to start this aid to promote the $500 million loan from the Export-Import Bank.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] Well-informed sources today do not believe that the invasion of Xinjiang by Outer Mongolian troops has international relations, and believe that this matter is only one of the most violent examples of the recent disputes in Xinjiang. It is believed here that the alleged cover of Outer Mongolian troops by aircraft with Soviet markings is not worthy of attention, at least for the time being. Well-informed sources pointed out that the Outer Mongolian Republic has received military and other assistance from the Soviet Union since signing an agreement with the Soviet Union. Outer Mongolian troops may use aircraft from the Soviet Union since January 1946 to cover the advance of troops without directly involving the Soviet Union. It is unanimously believed here that if it can be proved that the Soviet Union is indeed related to this action, the result will inevitably be that the United States will accelerate economic aid to the Chinese central government. Secretary of State Marshall and the State Department are planning to open the Export-Import Bank's $500 million loan to China and provide the Chinese government with some economic assistance.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] This correspondent's assessment of the event of Outer Mongolian troops invading Xinjiang Province states: This is not the first time that reports of Outer Mongolian troops invading Xinjiang or using Soviet aircraft have been received. Reports of this event were also received in February of this year, but they did not escalate because the local Chinese government troops responded effectively. Observers believe that if the reports are true this time, then Outer Mongolia's goal is to separate part or all of Xinjiang from China, not to interfere in China's civil war.</p>
<h3>The Spasms of Shenyang (One of the Northern Travelogues)</h3>
<p>— Bu Shaofu</p>
<p>In the middle of last month, the reporter was ordered by the newspaper to go to the north to inspect business, and returned to Shanghai yesterday. This trip lasted for four weeks. He stayed in Beiping, Tianjin, and Shenyang for nearly a week each. What he saw and heard during the journey were mostly fleeting glimpses. Now they will be recorded in chapters for reference by those who care about the current situation in the north.</p>
<p>The desolate Shenyang, lost too much blood, its pitiful state is like that.</p>
<p>Due to the abandonment of Changtu and Kaiyuan, the Communist army approached Tieling, causing this bleeding Shenyang to suddenly experience a spasm. On the morning of May 31, when I was about to board a military plane at the Xiyuan Airport in Beiping, a friend advised me to consider whether to make the trip.</p>
<p>On this day, Dong Yanping and Ye Nan of the Dalian-Lushun Inspection Group, and Shu Shicun, Deputy Commander of the New Sixth Army, flew to Shenyang. On this day, it was also the day that the Chairman left Shenyang to return to Beijing.</p>
<p>The scale of Beiling Airport is greater than Xiyuan. Overlooking Shenyang from the air at two thousand feet, it has some of the beauty of Beiping and even the industrial spirit that Beiping lacks. The air distance is 640 KM, a two-hour flight. When I got off the plane at Beiling Airport from Beiping to Shenyang, I saw a human Great Wall far away on the periphery of the airport, building fortifications in the sun, opening the prelude to the defense of Greater Shenyang. The authorities have mobilized 40,000 laborers to actively carry out this emergency measure.</p>
<p>It seems that we have to thank the past 13 years of Japanese rule in Manchukuo for its strict and serious household registration. This time, with a single order, 40,000 laborers sweated on time and on site. In the next few days, in Shenyang, I saw these toiling masses every morning, carrying dry food and iron shovels, going to the construction site in groups, and in the evening, I saw them dragging their tired bodies from the suburbs in twos and threes, wearing a cold and lonely expression.</p>
<p>I, this new guest, began to accept Shenyang's tension, panic, sullenness, pain, and loneliness. The sky is extremely high, with no wind or sand, and the sunshine leaves behind the lingering sweetness of spring. The air is quiet, the roads are long, straight, and wide, and the buildings are so towering and majestic, but people's feelings are not in harmony with everything in front of them.</p>
<p>On June 1, the garrison headquarters announced a special martial law order (later renamed "temporary martial law order"), with 11 articles. Anyone who violates them will be sentenced to death. Every day from 8:30 PM to 6:00 AM the next morning, no one is allowed to pass without a special pass. On the day this order was promulgated, stores closed their doors and windows before 8:00 PM, and pedestrians and vehicles were scurrying, with a mood similar to the air raid alarm being issued in the rear during the War of Resistance. The streets became even more deserted.</p>
<p>On the same day, the headquarters stipulated that all distilleries in the Northeast region should stop brewing wine for one month, and the municipal government also implemented control of grain reserves, banning the sale and transportation of rice, and restaurants were also prohibited from selling rice.</p>
<p>In the Railway Hotel, in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, in restaurants and taverns, in people's conversations, "When is your wife leaving?" "How are your family members?" "Are you leaving or not?" became necessary and popular questions. Naturally, this happened in groups going to the south, and also among a group of people with officials not too big and not too small.</p>
<p>The Security Commander's Headquarters was the busiest, and Chief of Staff Zhao Jiaxiang was even busier. Commander-in-Chief Du Yuming was ill, and he could not welcome the Chairman's visit to Shenyang, and even troubled the Chairman to visit his residence in person. The four deputy commanders-in-chief were also stationed in Shenyang, and only Sun Liren flew to Changchun the day before the Chairman's visit to Shenyang. He came back two days later. The other three were Zheng Dongguo, Ma Zhanshan, and Sun Du. However, reporters often couldn't see a responsible officer for a whole day to gather military news, and even when they managed to see them with great effort, they couldn't get any specific news information. People were anxious, and reporters were even more anxious about this kind of work situation of groping in the dark.</p>
<p>As a result, various rumors were spreading. One of them, containing infinite hope, was: Several divisions, several divisions of the National Army, have arrived outside the port of Yingkou on American transport ships and are about to land.</p>
<p>The prosperity and beauty of Haruhi-cho have long passed. The many cafes and bars left by the Japanese, although a very small number (with changed owners) are still struggling, are not what they used to be under the ban on dancing. Several Northeast waitresses told me very fondly about the extravagance of the people last year, and were saddened by the situation today.</p>
<p>"Hey! Since these two days, even the old men who come here to listen to music and drink coffee have become fewer."</p>
<p>Evening parties—social dances held in large and small mansions—the Railway Hotel used to hold at least three times a week. It once attracted countless gold diggers from Shanghai to travel over mountains and seas, it once created countless love stories, and it also completed many transactions, decorating the nightlife of Shenyang. A friend told me that in Shenyang, the fashionable way for fashionable people to entertain guests is to host an evening party, and the more female dance partners there are, the more glamorous it is. One of the reasons for losing that kind of heroism is, mainly, who dares to ignore people's accusations and be lavish and carefree at this time and in this place?

<h3>Beginning of the Prelude to a Major Battle Around Siping; Communist Forces' Fierce Attack Ultimately Repelled; Curfew Time Shortened in Stable Shenyang</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 12th] The prelude to a major battle around Siping has begun. Communist forces, having once again gathered outside Siping, launched an attack from the southeast towards Siping Airport and the train station at midnight on the 11th. Heavy artillery fire filled the air, and the fighting was intense. The Nationalist forces finally repelled the attack at 3 AM this morning, and the battle has since quieted down. The urban areas of Shenyang are relatively stable, and the curfew time was shortened by one and a half hours on the 12th, now from 10 PM to 6 AM the following morning. The newly appointed Garrison Commander Peng Xuan-sheng and Deputy Commander Wang Hua-xing will officially take office within days. Many rumors are circulating in the rural areas, and villagers are alarmed several times each night. It is rumored that foreign cavalry is mixed within the Communist forces, and there are widespread rumors that Soviet troops from Dalian will use the withdrawal from Shenyang as a pretext, causing public anxiety. The headquarters stated that this is Communist propaganda to confuse and disturb the people.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Changchun Dispatch, 12th] Military News: Although the situation in the Northeast appears calm on the surface recently, an increasingly tense atmosphere is actually brewing. The Nationalist forces, from the Jilin-Changchun area to the southern Liaoning area, are not only thoroughly strengthening the defensive works and capabilities of major strongholds along the vast and extended front line but are also deploying powerful combat groups to arrange a planned and confident offensive. The actions of the Nationalist forces in the northern Liaoning area in recent days reflect a meticulous effort to capture the main force of the Communist army. Although the Chinese Changchun Railway has been damaged, the Nationalist forces still ensure the main supply lines. The southern Songhua River area is under the control of the Nationalist forces. Currently, the Communist forces are scattered within this vast encirclement, attempting to break through everywhere. The gains and losses of small strongholds are no longer relevant to the overall situation. At the same time, it can be seen that the Communist forces are scurrying wildly in different directions, north and south, to conceal the location of their main force. As the Nationalist forces have completed their deployments in various areas, a large-scale annihilation battle is expected to begin soon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Shenyang Dispatch, 12th] Director Xiong convened a meeting at 3 PM on the 11th, gathering over five hundred officers from military agencies, units, police, and section chiefs stationed in Shenyang, to give instructions and explain the current changes in the war situation. He stated that our troops have now been redeployed and will take the initiative in the future, using mobile warfare tactics to eliminate the main force of the bandit army. Finally, he advised all officers to have unwavering confidence in winning the war and to never become discouraged or disheartened.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Communist forces that were harassing Xi Mu City were driven back on the 10th. After the Nationalist forces reoccupied the area, they continued to pursue in the direction of Xiuyan and dispatched troops to sweep towards Gaiping. Furthermore, the Nationalist forces have made a strategic withdrawal in Dandong Fengcheng, and they are now deploying strong defenses south of Qiaotou (98 kilometers from Shenyang).</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Changchun Dispatch, 12th] Military News: (1) On the morning of the 11th, several thousand Communist troops attacked Pinlu River from Yantongshan. The Nationalist forces bravely fought back, and the battle was extremely fierce. Subsequently, the Communist forces reinforced their troops and finally occupied the area before noon. It is reported that Korean officers and soldiers accounted for two-thirds of the Communist troops. (2) According to reports, north of the Songhua River, only Bin County currently has a Communist garrison command and troops stationed there. All other villages, large and small, are now free of Communist troops.</p>
<h3>The Beining Railway Attacked by Communist Forces</h3>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 12th] In order to consolidate the Northeast war situation, the Communist forces have intensified their attacks on the Beining Railway. On the 11th, Liushouying was again fiercely attacked, and the fighting has not yet ceased. At the same time, approximately twenty li (Chinese miles) of railway tracks between Liushouying and Zhangjiazhuang were destroyed, causing traffic to be interrupted again. After emergency repairs by the railway bureau, traffic resumed in the afternoon on the 12th. Nationalist trains are successively heading to eastern Hebei to strengthen defenses.</p>
<h3>Sweeping Up Communist Forces in the Yimeng Mountain Area; Nationalist Forces Achieve Initial Success; Fierce Fighting Erupts Again East of Laiwu and Xintai</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 12th] After the Communist forces in the southern Shandong mountain area were cleared, the Nationalist forces' sweep of the Yimeng Mountain area achieved initial success. Furthermore, Nationalist forces in central Shandong have begun searching the mountainous areas east of Laiwu. On the 11th, they eliminated a Communist regiment at Xujiazhuang, annihilating over seven hundred Communist troops and are now continuing to expand their victories.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Xuzhou Dispatch, 12th] Nationalist forces in western Shandong launched a sweeping campaign, and at 11 AM on the 11th, they routed the 5th Independent Brigade of the Communist army, east of Juye and southwest of Dayiji, killing over two hundred Communist troops and capturing eighty-three including a battalion-level instructor.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 11th] The Communist forces, originally withdrawn to the second line of the Yimeng Mountain area for reorganization and completion of the wheat harvest, include: (1) Two columns, totaling over 40,000 men, have gathered in the area east of Xintai.

<h3>Convulsions in Shenyang</h3>
<p>— Bu Shaofu</p>
<p>Continued from the previous page</p>
<p>There is an anecdote here. (Originally published in the Chinese-Soviet Daily, local edition, June 2nd)</p>
<p>"Someone impersonating General Zhu Qinglan's son, using the alias Zhu Huang, also known as Guo Hua, previously pretended to be a U.S. Army captain in the Northeast, swindling money and committing many evils. Later, Zhu's sixth son, Zhu Shu (currently a reporter for the Northeast Minbao), reported him with evidence. At the end of last month, he was arrested by the Commander's Office and is currently under interrogation. It is said that the person impersonating General Zhu's son can speak English and Russian and can also speak Shanghai and Cantonese. He is extremely alert. As early as 1938, he impersonated Zhu's son in Kunming and used deceptive tricks on Chairman Long Yun. Later, Cha Liangzhao proved his deception, and an arrest order was issued, but he escaped. He then defrauded a Mr. Yang in Hanoi. After the War of Resistance and after the Restoration, he impersonated a regimental commander in Hong Kong, Shijiazhuang, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places under the name of Zhu's son, deceiving many people. After arriving in the Northeast, he deceived Zang Qifang, the president of Dongda University, and was hired as a professor. He also deceived the chairman of Xing'an Province and was appointed as a councilor. He also claimed to be a U.S. Army captain and wore a U.S. Army uniform. He was arrested by the U.S. military police but was released. He then deceived Yi Guoduan, Sun Jiusi, Zhang Xueming, Ma Zhanshan, and other military and political figures. By this point, his purpose for deception was no longer just for money but included other motives. After receiving the report, the Commander's Office dispatched many officers to his residence (No. 5, Minjia Street) and arrested him. The person was in bed with a Japanese beauty. Another Japanese woman was found in another room. Secret codes and lightning rods and other suspicious items were found. His residence was extremely luxurious, with a wooden sign at the entrance reading "Zheshao Rice Apartment." He spoke with a Huguang accent and had a thin face and purple lips, suggesting an opium addiction. The Japanese woman sleeping with him was said to be the daughter of an official used by Zhang Jinghui of the puppet Manchukuo. Besides impersonating General Zhu's son, the person had no documents to prove his real name or origin, making it quite the amusing story."</p>
<p>The next day, the "Scenery Line" column in the Northeast Vanguard Daily had these sentences:</p>
<p>"Strange things happen everywhere, but Shenyang has more. There are those who impersonate Zhu Qinglan's son to swagger and deceive, and those who are deceived are all high-ranking officials. The swindler is truly superhuman."</p>
<p>If the author is looking at it from a positive angle, he is too narrow-minded. As far as I know, Shenyang has more than just this "Young Master Zhu." What is unsaid is worthy of our consideration.</p>
<p>The Xiaofengman power supply is blocked, and Shenyang's water and electricity rely on the city's two broken machines, which operate intermittently. A cement company under the Resource Committee is resuming production as quickly as possible. In April and May, it produced 10,000 tons each month, but now the machines are not running due to the lack of electricity. Speaking of electricity, there is a little story. Sun Yueqi came to Shenyang last time and stayed at the Railway Hotel at the Grand Rotary. Seeing the lights in every room of the large building across the street shining like a painting all night, he almost gnashed his teeth and said: "This is sucking my blood!" Electricity is the blood of industry. Today, the loss of blood for Northeast industry is also one of the main reasons for its stagnation.</p>
<p>I toured the Tiexi district for a week. The forest of factory chimneys was as silent as a ruin. The railway tracks, power transmission lines, buildings, and streets, all of this on tens of miles of land, showed the gradual progress of its creator's grand and complete plan. One rubber factory is still in operation, using up its remaining raw materials. It will stop even if it doesn't want to, but most of the others are already in a state of dormancy. After the major wounds of demolition and destruction, the Northeast industry is only left with a damaged body.</p>
<p>Looking at Pan Yang, thinking of the Northeast, I feel annoyed for my country! Those who work in the Northeast are particularly clear-eyed and know what the development of this situation will lead to. One newspaper called for: "In military affairs, the government should currently concentrate the nation's military forces in the Northeast; in politics, it should implement a new policy, using the political structure and policies of the puppet Manchukuo as the backbone; in economics, it should quickly restore industry. The economic barriers of the circulating currency, which is isolated from the legal tender, must be reconsidered." Whether this call is correct or not is not discussed, but it is enough to express dissatisfaction with the current situation.</p>
<p>Today, the Northeast problem is not a simple military problem; the interior has failed to pay close attention to the exterior, failing to encourage them positively and failing to prevent them from stealing and plundering negatively. This is what we should examine and correct. A dignified institution of higher learning can use the hiring and evaluation of professors as a game; a single sand crab can arbitrarily transfer hundreds of thousands of circulating currency; those who hold their posts, are honest and diligent, and have talent and ambition are unable to do anything or are obstructed. I don't know much, but what little I do know is enough to cause worry.</p>
<h3>Major Fire on the Yangtze River in Hankou, Zhenxing Wheel Destroyed</h3>
<p>One Dead and Eight Injured Due to Careless Refueling</p>
<p>[Hankou, this newspaper, 12th] A major fire broke out on the river surface at the Fourth Dock in Hankou this morning. The Zhenxing Wheel of the Changhan Company, which was berthed there, has been destroyed. One oil worker in the fire hold died, and eight were injured. A tugboat of the Chu'an Company nearby was also affected, with only the hull remaining. The cause of the fire was due to carelessness when refueling the Zhenxing's fire hold.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Facing the Current Wage Problem</h3>
<p>On February 17th of this year, the Economic Emergency Measures Plan was announced, stipulating that "the salaries and wages of employees in designated areas, calculated according to the cost-of-living index, should take the cost-of-living index for January of this year as the highest index." In that month, the city's cost-of-living index was 7,945 times. By May 10th, the National Economic Commission discussed the issue of workers' wages in Shanghai, revised and passed the "Interim Measures for Wage Adjustment in Shanghai," submitted by the Ministry of Social Affairs, and resolved to implement it from May. The city's worker cost-of-living index for May was announced as 23,500 times, an increase of more than two times compared to January. This caused a stir in the economic world. The employers felt that the wages were too heavy and could not afford it. They held meetings to discuss and research countermeasures and sent representatives to appeal, hoping to find a remedy. Some businesses have clearly stated that they cannot pay according to the new measures and are still paying according to the April wages. This has caused much confusion and many disputes. Their reasons are: (1) the increase is too much and they cannot afford it; (2) the social purchasing power is too weak to pass on the costs; (3) the previous orders are now subject to huge cost increases, causing unbearable losses; (4) industry and commerce are already in dire straits, and this is adding insult to injury, forcing them to collapse faster; (5) the government is suppressing prices, and it is not appropriate to raise costs and fuel inflation. The most concrete measure they have proposed is that since wage calculations are based on the pre-war basis, the increase in base salaries for workers after the war is unreasonable and should be restored to the pre-war standard to show fairness. The above arguments are reasonable and well-founded. However, the workers believe that: (1) base salaries above 30 yuan have already been discounted, so it cannot be said that they are based on the pre-war standard; (2) the crisis in industry and commerce has many factors and cannot be attributed to high wages alone; many businesses, even if wages are further discounted or workers are forced to work for free, may not be able to stand firm; (3) taking the price of rice as an example, a normal wage of 30 to 40 yuan before the war could buy four to five dan of rice, but now 700,000 to 800,000 yuan can only buy two dan; (4) some wages were indeed too low before the war and must be appropriately increased for adjustment.</p>
<p>Therefore, the authorities stated: (1) restoring pre-war base salaries is impossible; (2) if there are actual difficulties, they can only be resolved individually, and there is no possibility of comprehensive assistance; (3) work hours can be appropriately increased to increase production to compensate for the employers' losses; (4) before the problem is resolved, the employers should first pay a portion of the wages to maintain the workers' livelihoods, and the workers should continue to work as usual to avoid production shutdowns. During this period, employers must not close factories or stores, and workers must not strike or slow down work to increase the difficulty of the problem.</p>
<p>Originally, the cost-of-living index, although a good measure, is a powerful foothold for resolving disputes. But it is different from standard wages, especially from rigid legal wages. It was only at the beginning of the restoration, when labor disputes were rampant, that this statistic was introduced as a basis for negotiations. There was no intention to make it a fixed and uniform standard at the time. Therefore, after a short period of use, a Wage Review Board was established to deliberate and apply it flexibly to compensate for this shortcoming. Later, a financial institution and a public utility in the city separately compiled their own indexes and used them separately to adapt to the facts. There are even more industries and businesses that do not calculate wages according to the index. This proves that the universal application of this standard is impractical and theoretically not entirely satisfactory.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, price fluctuations are too severe, and wage disputes are too numerous. In the absence of any other options, this cost-of-living index has been recognized as the only standard, and habit has become nature. It is as if this index and wages are one and the same, but in reality, it is difficult to fully match, and variations are readily seen. For example, the discount payment method has already been implemented in some more difficult industries and businesses, such as the knitting industry, last year. The number of senior staff who apply this example is even greater. Therefore, the index discount cannot be regarded as the latest product. There are many cases of adding supplements to the application of the index, such as increasing base salaries, distributing goods in kind, issuing bonuses, and providing meals and accommodation. After the index freeze, the rationing of daily necessities (in this city, it is the discounted differential payment) is another remedy for index-based wages. Therefore, the actual variations in the application of the cost-of-living index are numerous.</p>
<p>Article 5 of the Interim Measures for Wage Adjustment states: "If an employer is unable to afford to pay wages in accordance with Articles 3 to 5 of these Measures due to poor production and business conditions, the labor and management parties may agree to reduce them." This provision is more of an extension of application, which is more practical. Because in fact, some are already higher than the index, and some are still lower than the index. This result is mostly obtained from mutual agreement, and it is not necessary for the employer to be really unable to afford it before this principle can be applied.</p>
<p>Land is the price of labor, and the rise and fall of the price has its own natural adjustment rules. In some occasions, it is possible to add various artificial restrictions, but restricting wages is equivalent to restricting prices, and agreeing on wages is equivalent to negotiating prices. Of these two, negotiating prices is more reasonable. However, production and business conditions vary, and even in the same period and the same industry, the strength and profit and loss conditions are not the same. Therefore, the principles of equal pay for equal work and equal pay for equal location are at least not very applicable when negotiating. It is necessary to consider the facts and deliberate separately to seek appropriateness. The authorities' advocacy of individual solutions and separate agreements is considered the most practical and easier to start with than comprehensive assistance.</p>
<p>The so-called separate agreement means separate compromises, so the key lies in mutual harmony and tolerance. Labor and management must know each other, understand each other, and give way to each other before a compromise can be reached. If they only know how to take care of their own positions, insist on unilateral interests, and have no concept of being in the same boat, or if they take the opportunity to cause trouble during the agreement process, create unexpected disputes, and force the other party to reluctantly comply, then even if they succeed temporarily, they will eventually fail. Therefore, in this time of heavy difficulties, we sincerely hope that both parties will broaden their horizons and show the greatest tolerance. We also hope that the authorities will guide both parties with sincerity to find a reasonable solution. As for the so-called purchasing raw materials on behalf, reducing taxes, facilitating transportation, opening up sales channels, and providing legitimate loans, these are indeed fundamental relief measures. If they can advocate and fulfill them in earnest, so that industry and commerce can have a turning point, then what seems powerless today may not be impossible to handle easily in the future. Then, all difficulties can be solved easily.</p>

<h3>To Prevent Communist Forces from Extending into Western Europe, the United States Will No Longer Stand by and Watch; Future Developments Depend on the Attitude of the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 12th] Relations between the United States and the Soviet Union have reached a crucial juncture of "showdown" today. Due to the further embrace of the Soviet Union by Hungary and Bulgaria, the United States is prepared to: (1) Unless the Soviet Union agrees to conduct a proper investigation into the way the Hungarian Communist Party overthrew the Nagy government, the United States is prepared to take this matter to the United Nations. (2) To preserve the democratic governments of France, Italy, and Austria, the United States intends to take economic and diplomatic action to build a strong line of defense against the westward advance of communism.</p>
<p>The State Department issued a note to the Soviet Union on the 11th with the strongest tone used by the United States since President Truman announced his anti-totalitarianism doctrine on March 12th. The United States is determined not to allow Moscow's actions in Hungary to go unhindered. The future of US-Soviet relations depends on the Soviet Union's response to the US request for an unfettered investigation into the situation in Hungary. If the Soviet Union rejects the US request, the US intends to appeal to the United Nations. The US's tough note clearly states that the US is considering this plan and condemning the Soviet Union for overthrowing the freely elected Nagy government and brutally interfering in Hungary's internal affairs. The Soviet Union's actions violate the Yalta Agreement. Regardless of the outcome of the US protest, the US is unwilling to stand by and watch as the Communist Party expands its influence to other governments.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Marshall's Policy Planning Staff has been ordered to stop studying world economic problems and their impact on US foreign policy. The committee's work is now focused on Europe, and research is also underway on other "ways to stop communism," such as:</p>
<p>(1) In Italy, the United States intends to provide large-scale assistance to the non-communist government led by Prime Minister Gasperi, including early allocation of $125 million in relief aid after the end of the Allied Forces, approval of Italy's planned use of $100 million in Export-Import Bank loans, release of $60 million in Italian assets frozen in the United States, and commercial, debt, and aviation negotiations with Italy.</p>
<p>(2) In France, the United States supports the World Bank's lending of another $250 million to Prime Minister Ramadier's anti-communist government to assist France's four-year recovery plan. In addition, grains and machinery may be provided as another way to assist France.</p>
<p>(3) In Austria, if the Soviet Union is found to be instigating a coup in Austria, the United States may postpone the long-awaited conclusion of a peace treaty with Austria.</p>
<h3>US Diplomacy Takes a Two-Pronged Approach: Strongly Protests Soviet Incitement of the Hungarian Coup; Condemns Bulgaria's Arrest of Opposition Leaders</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 11th] The United States' strong protest to Soviet General Sviridov, chairman of the Allied Control Commission in Hungary, regarding recent events in Hungary was released today. It accused the Soviet Union of openly interfering in Hungarian politics in violation of the Yalta Agreement and requested an immediate investigation into the Hungarian political situation by a tripartite committee. The protest also stated that the US government, in view of its obligations under the Yalta Agreement and as a signatory to the Hungarian Armistice Agreement and a member of the United Nations, will consider other such actions as necessary if it does not obtain agreement on the foregoing measures to conduct a proper investigation. Regarding the alleged confession of Bela Kovacs, Secretary-General of the Hungarian Smallholders Party, the protest stated that the British and American members of the Allied Control Commission were not informed of the information that led to the resignation of Prime Minister Nagy and others, which violated Chapter VI, Section "C" of the Allied Control Commission's military regulations, which stipulates that British and American representatives have the right to obtain copies of all reports and documents of interest to the British and American governments. The US government believes that the development of Hungary has allowed a minority party with only 17 percent of popular support in the last election to abolish the will expressed by the majority of the people. Communist leader Rakosi has apparently admitted this situation and has openly expressed his satisfaction that his iron-clad party has been able to take control of Hungary as a result.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 11th] The State Department issued a statement today condemning the arrest of Bulgarian opposition leader Petkov. The statement said that if Petkov is accused of treason and tried, the current Bulgarian regime will also be judged by the opinions of many Bulgarians and the public opinion of all free people outside Bulgaria. Petkov is a legally elected member of parliament, and his leadership of the opposition and his struggle to defend human rights have aroused the deep sympathy of the United States. The Yalta Agreement, the Bulgarian Armistice Agreement, and the Peace Treaty all contain provisions guaranteeing the freedom of the Bulgarian people. The US government has repeatedly expressed concern about the development of the political situation in Bulgaria, because these developments are completely contrary to the letter and spirit of the Yalta Agreement.</p>
<h3>Nagy Points Out that the Soviet Union is Using Nazi Tactics</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 11th] Vansittart read a letter from former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy to the House of Lords tonight, condemning the Soviet Union for using Nazi tactics to completely place Hungary under Communist control.

Allied observers speculate that Bulgaria and Yugoslavia are preparing to establish a Balkan Federation, with unified military cooperation as the beginning of the federation. The Czech delegation, led by Defense Minister Svoboda, will stay here for two days and then travel throughout Yugoslavia for ten days.

<p>[United Press Belgrade, 12th] The government announced that Yugoslavia and Romania have reached an agreement in recent talks on a common policy to defend the interests of the Danube River.</p>
<h3>23 Members of the Bulgarian Agrarian Party Expelled</h3>

<h3>US State Department Attaches Importance to the Near East and Middle East</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 10th] Senior US State Department officials said that the conflict of interests of all major countries in the Near East and Middle East has made the area the most likely source of future wars. This view is held by Henderson, director of the US Near East and Africa Division, who explained to the Senate Appropriations Committee and requested an increase in the staff of the division. At the same time, Far East Division Director Vincent told the committee that the Far East Division urgently needs capable personnel to assist in negotiations with Japan next year and the drafting of a Japanese peace treaty.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union and Hungary Negotiate a New Military Alliance; Hungary Sends Military Officers to the Soviet Union for Training</h3>
<p>[United Press Hungarian Capital, 11th] According to reliable sources today, the Soviet Union is currently negotiating a new mutual assistance treaty with Hungary for peacetime, so that Hungarian troops can cooperate with Soviet troops in the event of war. The Soviet Union is also secretly training senior Hungarian officers at the Soviet Tactical Academy in Moscow. Former Hungarian Capital Police Chief Zilev and others will be the first group of Hungarians to receive Soviet military training. However, officials in the Ministry of the Army neither confirmed nor denied this statement, as well as the statement that Hungarian officers were observing Soviet military exercises in Transdanubia. According to some Hungarians, the Hungarian radio station broadcast a warning that anyone who discusses such military exercises will be arrested. Informed sources also said that according to the agreement concluded at the end of the war, Hungarian troops were guaranteed to join the Soviet side in the event of war, but this agreement would be invalidated upon final ratification of the peace treaty. Therefore, the Soviet Union is now negotiating and signing a new agreement with Hungary.</p>
<h3>The British Government Takes a Cautious Approach; Watching the Situation in Hungary, Bulgaria, and Austria; Believes that Friendship Should be Established between Britain and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 11th] During the foreign affairs debate in the House of Lords, government spokesman Lord Pakenham announced that the British representative in Hungary has been ordered to make it clear to the Hungarian government that the British government is watching the situation in Hungary with extreme caution, and any deviation from democratic principles will seriously affect the political and economic relations between Britain and Hungary.</p>
<p>Regarding the situation in Austria, Pakenham said that the government was deeply disturbed to learn from the newspapers that Austrian politicians were discussing reorganizing the Austrian government to change its nature. The British government is confident that the Austrian government will maintain its democratic foundations and refuse to succumb to any pressure. Pakenham continued that Britain believes that friendship should be established between Britain and the Soviet Union to prevent Europe from being divided into two. For this reason, the government attaches great importance to the British-Soviet trade negotiations. Pakenham also said that the Communist Party has now acquired disproportionate control in Hungary, and it is difficult to determine its attitude towards the situation in Hungary until the government knows whether the Communist Party will consolidate its position regardless of Parliament and the people or whether the Soviet government will fulfill its obligations under the Yalta Agreement as desired by the British government. In view of the Soviet Union's contribution to the liberation of Hungary, the British government has never wanted to exclude the rights that the Soviet Union should enjoy in Hungary, but in such circumstances, Hungary should not be prevented from establishing friendships with other countries. Britain does not believe that the Hungarian people want their country to become a vassal of any strong country, and if the current developments lead to Hungary becoming a totalitarian state and oppressing the current democratic regime, then the British government will have to revise its attitude.</p>
<h3>Indian Princes Preparing to Organize a Union; Planning to Build the Rajisthan State; Also Want to Obtain Dominion Status</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 11th] Indian sources here recently said that the Indian princes are currently studying the possibility of establishing a union of princes, to be called "Rajisthan" (the state divided by princes), and also want to find ways to obtain dominion status.</p>
<h3>British, American and Australian Discussions on a Pacific Joint Defense Plan Completed with Joint Statement by Australia</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 12th Broadcast: Britain, the United States, and Australia are currently discussing a joint defense plan for the Pacific region. Following the completion of defense negotiations between the US and Australia regarding the Pacific, Britain and Australia will immediately proceed with negotiations of a similar nature. It is reported that Field Marshal Montgomery is scheduled to begin negotiations with an Australian cabinet member on July 2nd. During these negotiations, the Australian side will inquire with British representatives about the extent of the forces Britain can contribute to the Pacific joint defense.</p>
<p>[United Press, Canberra, 12th] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt and the US Ambassador to Australia, Butler, jointly issued a statement on the afternoon of the 11th, stating that the US and Australia have reached an agreement to continue close cooperation in Pacific defense. This agreement was reached following several meetings in the past few days between US Middle Pacific Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Denfield and senior Australian officials. The joint statement also stated that the talks were fruitful in all respects, and cooperation between the US and Australia is limited to defense and complies with the principles of the United Nations. The Manus Island in Australia was built with US funding during the war, and the US Navy requested it as a supply base for US forces. This point was not mentioned in the joint statement. It is also learned that Denfield left here for Pearl Harbor on the afternoon of the 11th.</p>

<h3>Supports International Control of Atomic Factories, Soviet Representative Offers New Proposals, but the Veto Issue Remains Unresolved</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 11th] During a meeting of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission today, Soviet representative Gromyko declared that the Soviet government supports international control and supervision of all atomic energy factories, mines, and stored materials, indicating significant progress in resolving the atomic energy issue. Gromyko presented several new proposals for establishing international control of atomic energy, first expressing his opinion on the disputed term "supervision," which he had previously refused to explain. While Gromyko's speech is a new step toward compromise, qualified sources point out that Gromyko's proposals are too narrow in scope, and a definitive agreement cannot be reached until the veto issue is resolved. The main points of Gromyko's proposals are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The atomic energy regulatory agency, namely the International Atomic Energy Commission, should be organized by international personnel. (2) The commission should periodically inspect atomic energy factories, mines, and stored materials in various countries to assess the use of atomic energy. (3) The commission should have the power to provide recommendations to governments and the Security Council regarding measures to be taken against countries that violate the convention prohibiting the manufacture of atomic weapons. (4) The commission should also have the right to study atomic energy for peaceful purposes to maintain effective control. Countries may also individually conduct atomic energy research for peaceful purposes, but they must exchange their atomic energy discoveries and progress with the International Control Commission.</p>
<h3>Differences Persist Between US and Soviet Union on Disarmament Issues</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 11th] Regarding the question of whether all armaments, including atomic weapons, should be discussed simultaneously, the United Nations Disarmament Commission held a meeting for review, and differences of opinion between the US and Soviet representatives led to another dispute. Soviet representative Gromyko said: "In my view, it is impossible to discuss the so-called general armaments issue separately from the issue of atomic weapons and weapons of mass destruction." US representative Austin expressed disagreement with the Soviet proposal, stating that if the methods of reducing general armaments and atomic armaments are considered simultaneously, it would exceed the authority granted to this committee by the Security Council.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei's Treason Was Premeditated in the Autumn of 1938</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] Lieutenant General Kagesa Teishō, the highest advisor to the former puppet government and the head of the "Kikan" special agency, recently submitted a detailed account of Wang Jingwei's collusion with Japan in his defense statement to the military tribunal. According to reports, in the autumn of 1938, Colonel Imaida had already drafted a "peace proposal" with Umekawa, and in November, Kagesa and Imaida went to Shanghai to meet with Umekawa again and decided to publish the so-called one-to-many peace conditions at the same time as Wang Jingwei escaped from Chongqing. On December 20, 1938, when Wang Jingwei arrived in Hanoi, Konoe immediately issued the so-called Thirty Principles declaration on the 22nd, and Wang Jingwei immediately responded with a telegram of support. Kagesa himself, along with Vice Minister Shigemitsu and Inukai Ken (son of former Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi, who was the Democratic Party Secretary-General before this election and has been reorganized), rushed to Hanoi and arrived in Shanghai on the same boat as Wang Jingwei, and the plan to establish an independent government was agreed upon with Wang Jingwei on the boat. Kagesa also revealed that Japan supported Wang Jingwei on the one hand, and on the other hand, Foreign Minister Matsuoka and others attempted to lure the National Government of China, which was resisting Japan, but their conspiracy ultimately failed.</p>

<h3>US Military Government Officials Reveal That Japanese Zaibatsu Have Not Been Eliminated and Still Have the Power to Influence the Japanese Government</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 12th] A spokesman for MacArthur's headquarters reported today that the backbone of Japanese zaibatsu control has been destroyed, which is quite contrary to the opinion of American officials in Osaka. According to Welch, director of the Antitrust Division of the headquarters' Economic and Scientific Section, the medical and investment rights of 67 major Japanese industrial companies have been taken over by the Japanese government's Liquidation Committee. However, officials of the Osaka Military Government told United Press reporters last week that the Japanese zaibatsu have not been eliminated, and the dissolution of their industrial companies, the sale of their stocks, and the disqualification of industrial magnates have had little practical impact on ending the zaibatsu system. Many current officials still consult them, and the stocks are manipulated, making it unclear who actually owns them. Although economic leaders have been reorganized, they still control industry from behind the scenes. The industrialists in Osaka have a strong influence and can actually influence the Tokyo government. Although the Socialist Prime Minister has formed a coalition government, it has not changed this balance.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 12th] The Ministry of Finance announced today that Emperor Hirohito of Japan is listed first on the Japanese taxpayer list and must pay 3.3 billion yen in income tax this year. The zaibatsu such as Sumitomo, Mitsui, and Iwasaki are next, each of which must pay between 50 million and 100 million yen.</p>
<h3>Sundanese People's Party Plans to Exclude Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Batavia, 11th] Kintale Gawawa, leader of the Sundanese People's Party, recently spoke about the party's economic program, stating that Indonesians must break the economic control of the overseas Chinese in Indonesia. The first step will be to consolidate the Indonesian middle class, especially the Sundanese middle class, and then confront the exploitation of the upper class and Chinese chambers of commerce. Before the war, the debts of the Indonesian middle class to overseas Chinese lenders accounted for 55% of the debtors' debts, which has now increased to 75%. The commercial companies established by this party in and around Bandung supply goods to the people at a price that is only one-third of the market price controlled by overseas Chinese merchants.</p>
<h3>Super Bomber Completed in the US</h3>

Although its basic characteristics are similar to the B-29, there are many significant differences. The wings are lighter and the fuselage is stronger.</p>
<h3>Arabs Determined to Boycott the Palestine Inquiry Commission</h3>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 12th] Palestinian Arab leaders today predicted that the Arabs will stage a symbolic general strike on Monday, the first day the United Nations Inquiry Commission meets in the Holy Land.

The Arabs have learned many lessons from the Jews, such as the fact that the people can only protect their legitimate status through force.</p>

<h3>Disputes over Cost-of-Living Index-Based Wages Increase, Labor-Management Conflicts Rise Daily, Shoe Industry Crisis Escalates, Fashion Industry Strike Begins Yesterday, Employers Demand Rectification of Labor Discipline</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Disputes over the cost-of-living index are erupting everywhere. The Social Affairs Bureau's principle is to resolve them individually for each factory, handling them separately. Some employers are demanding that the Social Affairs Bureau rectify labor discipline.</p>
<p>The dispute involving the hand-operated knitting machine groups in the first, second, and third districts, which resulted in a siege of the Songshan Police Station until late at night, continued to be mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning, but without result. The Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau has transferred the case to the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee.</p>
<p>Workers in the shoe industry began a slowdown at the beginning of the week due to disputes over the cost-of-living index. Yesterday, the situation escalated, with striking workers forming teams to post slogans in the Dongxinqiao Xiaohua Garden and other store areas, and persuading non-striking workers to stop working. The police station considered this action to be disruptive to order and arrested several workers in various districts, who were released after persuasion. At 5 pm yesterday, the trade association held a meeting at the Heming Shoe and Hat Store to discuss countermeasures. Upon hearing the news, the workers rushed there and gathered in front of the door, with a great uproar. The police station sent police to the scene to maintain order, and the meeting was also stopped as a result. According to the person in charge of the trade association, the employers currently have no other recourse but to wait for mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, and the official documents have been submitted that day.</p>
<p>Workers in the fashion industry went on strike yesterday morning and petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau. In addition to advising the workers to resume work immediately, the bureau convened both parties for mediation at 11 am. The labor side demanded payment based on the index, while the employer agreed to first pay a portion. The two sides did not reach an agreement.</p>
<p>Tofu Industry</p>
<p>Some tofu industry workers have resumed work yesterday, but the Social Affairs Bureau needs to wait for all workers to resume work before discussing further.</p>
<p>Electrical Knitting</p>
<p>According to the previous contract between the labor and management sides of the electrical knitting machine groups in the first, second, and third districts, wages are to be paid according to the previous month's index. Now that the index has been unfrozen from May, if wages are paid according to the regulations, it would be 7,945 times plus a difference of 117,000 yuan. The workers believe that this amount cannot maintain their livelihood and demand payment based on 14,800 times.</p>
<p>Photographic Plate Making</p>
<p>The employer in the photographic plate making industry submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating that they cannot bear the index of 23,500 times and requested a discount in addition to the stipulated method.</p>
<p>Mirror Making</p>
<p>The labor side of the mirror making industry submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau, alleging that the employer did not pay wages according to the index. The labor side of the thermos bottle industry also submitted a document, alleging that the employer wanted to pay wages based on 80% of the previous month's index and requested correction.</p>
<p>Bathhouse Industry</p>
<p>Workers in the furnace rooms of bathhouses claimed that the employer had not been paying wages according to the index since January. Now that the index has been unfrozen, they demand that it be paid accordingly.</p>
<p>Dyeing Industry</p>
<p>Six hundred employees in the dyeing industry requested improved treatment. The Social Affairs Bureau mediated yesterday and agreed on a solution.</p>
<p>Printing Industry</p>
<p>Regarding the printing industry dispute, the Social Affairs Bureau convened the employer's trade association and the labor side's printing and letterpress workers' union for mediation yesterday. The employer expressed dissatisfaction, and the Social Affairs Bureau decided to make a ruling according to the law.</p>
<h3>Families of Officers and Soldiers Killed in the Fubo Incident Request Relief from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Fubo warship tragedy is currently under trial in the district court. Yesterday afternoon at 1 pm, more than 40 family members of the deceased officers and soldiers went to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for negotiations. Three days ago, they had requested the company to provide relief to the families of the deceased officers and soldiers, and the company had promised to respond within three days. Yesterday was the last day. Family members sent representatives Wang Bo and four others to meet with the company's Deputy General Manager Shen. Because the response failed to satisfy the family members, they had not left by late at night.</p>
<h3>Difficulty of Purchasing a Ticket Voucher Exceeds Purchasing a Ticket, Railway Bureau Discusses Improvements</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The newly built second, third, and fourth-class passenger waiting room at the North Railway Station opened yesterday, and a new method was implemented. Passengers must first purchase a "ticket purchase order voucher" and then enter the room to exchange for a ticket with the voucher. The original purpose of this method was to facilitate passengers and eliminate scalpers. Unexpectedly, the initial trial run yesterday created difficulties, and the effect was the opposite. Passengers all complained. In view of the actual situation, the Railway Bureau decided to convene a meeting today to seek improvement measures.</p>
<p>The waiting room is 400 meters long and about 50 meters wide. Within ten steps of entering the door, there are four entrances for passage. The order vouchers are sold here, but because the area is too narrow, buyers are crowded, and even after queuing, it is difficult to maintain order. Therefore, it is generally believed that the difficulty of purchasing a voucher exceeds purchasing a ticket. Yesterday, many of the ticket window glass were broken by passengers. Although Chen Shuhuang, the chief of the North Station, the head of the baggage room, and senior officials from the Transportation Department directed work in the room all day, order was still not restored.</p>

<h3>Three Principles Determined for United Power Plant, Purely Private Organization Hopes for Foreign Investment</h3>
<p>[Our Report] To solve the city's electricity shortage, the City Council has approved the unification of the city's power generation institutions and the organization of a united power plant. The reporter specifically visited Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao Zengjue yesterday to inquire about the planning of the united power plant. According to Director Zhao, the city's electricity supply is extremely alarming, and the organization of a united power plant is necessary to concentrate funds, save resources, and allow machinery and specialized personnel to be coordinated and applied. Therefore, the Public Utilities Bureau absolutely supports the proposal of the City Council. The bureau has decided on the following three major principles for the united power plant in terms of financial resources, material resources, and organization:</p>
<p>In terms of funds: The united power plant hopes to utilize foreign investment and also welcomes strong domestic funds, with each accounting for half of the total. On the foreign investment side, US funds are the most likely. On the domestic side, it is hoped that all existing power companies can actively participate. The shortfall will be filled by inviting bankers and entrepreneurs to invest.</p>
<p>In terms of machinery: It is requested that the central government consider the severity of the city's electricity shortage and prioritize the allocation of Japanese reparations materials to the united power plant for application. There is currently a 53,000-kilowatt generator that was shipped from Japan, and the central government has agreed to allocate it to the city for application first, and it will arrive in Shanghai soon. In addition, there are several 35,000-kilowatt generators that the bureau has also requested the central government to allocate to the city. Furthermore, the united power plant will request preferential rights to purchase state-owned enterprises that are being sold off to private entities by the central government.</p>
<p>In terms of organization: The organization of the united power plant is purely private and absolutely democratic.

<h2>Reader Consultation - Legal Q &amp; A</h2>
<h3>Adoption and Inheritance</h3>
<p>Question from Yu Xingchu: A female relative of mine is 19 years old. Her father died three years ago, leaving only her and her mother. Her paternal cousin is forcing her to adopt an heir and is coercing her to sign an inheritance agreement. She is afraid to resist due to his intimidating behavior. I have several legal questions: (1) Does a woman have inheritance rights? (2) Is an inheritance agreement obtained under duress valid? (3) What can be done if the other party refuses to allow the woman to inherit? (4) Three years ago, the woman became engaged to a man named Jia under her mother's orders. The woman completely opposes this engagement and wants to dissolve it. What can be done if the other party refuses? (5) How should the betrothal gifts, approximately one shi of white rice, be returned?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Fu Kuanglin] (1) Yes, a woman has inheritance rights. (2) If it was indeed obtained under duress and she did not subsequently agree to it, it can be revoked. However, attention should be paid to the statute of limitations under Article 93 of the Civil Code. (3) She can request restitution according to Article 1146 of the Civil Code, but attention should be paid to the statute of limitations under the second paragraph of that article. (4) If it was not agreed to by her at the time, she can declare her disavowal. (5) File a lawsuit in court. (6) Convert it to its equivalent value.</p>

<h2>Sing Tao Team on Expedition</h2>
<h3>Insufficient Reserves - Situation Tense for Victory and Happiness</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hong Kong Shipping News] Hong Kong's sports scene has been quiet since the start of summer, and the holding of the Guangdong Provincial Games has drawn away some athletes, reducing the enthusiasm for small football matches.</p>
<p>There are rumors that teams from the Philippines and Shantou will be visiting Hong Kong, but in terms of Hong Kong's basketball standards, it should be no problem to deal with the Chaozhou-Shantou team, but it is hard to imagine competing against the Philippines. The news that the Shanghai-Shantou team was coming to Hong Kong caused considerable excitement here, but only the sound of footsteps was heard, and the people were not seen.</p>
<h2>Sing Tao Conquers the Philippines</h2>
<p>Since arriving in Manila, the Sing Tao team has reported successive victories, especially in the match against the Jin Min champion team. Despite playing in the rain, they still won by four goals, a good record. However, in the fourth match against the Lianle team, they lost 1-0 in the first half. In the second half, Feng Jingxiang scored two goals in the fourth and eighteenth minutes, respectively, to reverse the score to 2-1. Then the Lianle team's right striker scored a goal, making it 2-2. The victory was only determined in the last few minutes, with Li Zhaorong scoring the winning goal. While in Min, the mayor presented each of them with a "gold-plated key to the Philippines." The biggest loss for the Sing Tao team's expedition is the lack of reserve players. If the two central wingers are injured, the lineup will be a big problem. This may be one of the reasons for their defeat when they arrive in England in the future. Qiu Ting is still recovering from his injuries and has not played in recent games.</p>
<h2>Guangdong Provincial Games</h2>
<p>After seven days of competition in the Guangdong Provincial Games, there were no outstanding achievements, but disputes arose one after another. In fact, in terms of football, the Municipal Police, Sanshui, and Nanhai teams all had high hopes for the championship by bringing in players from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The first dispute was the battle for the semi-final spot between Nanhai and Sanshui in the Provincial Championship. Nanhai was forced to forfeit due to scheduling issues. After the appeal, Chairman Luo Zhuoying had to set up another silver tripod to allow the two teams to compete again.</p>
<p>In the County League final, the match between Nanhai and Wuhua ended in a 3-3 draw. The spectators supporting Wuhua beat the referee Zhu Guolun, and the meeting broke up unhappily. The organizers had no choice but to declare the two teams joint champions. When the Municipal Police team forfeited the Provincial Championship final due to various reasons, Sanshui won without a fight. Such sporting achievements make one afraid to think about the future of sports in our country.</p>
<h2>Summer Horse Racing</h2>

<h2>Hao Gengsheng Reports in Nanjing</h2>
<h3>Reasons for the Postponement of the National Games</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, June 11] Hao Gengsheng talked about the postponement of the National Games in the afternoon of June 11, saying that the biggest key to the postponement of the National Games was not that the Executive Yuan did not subsidize 2 billion, but that the venue could not be repaired by the Double Tenth Festival (October 10). The advantages of changing to May 5th next year are two: (1) According to the regulations, the qualifications of athletes must be in the institution or school for three months. If it is held on the Double Tenth Festival, the university freshmen will have just entered school after the summer, and the qualification is difficult to determine. (2) Many overseas Chinese who want to participate enthusiastically may not be able to make it for this year's Double Tenth Festival. Although the meeting period has been extended, the preparatory work has not only not been relaxed, but has been intensified. Director Zhao of the Shanghai Public Works Bureau recently came to Nanjing to negotiate with the Ministry of National Defense on the transfer of the venue. Now the track and field venue has been completely vacated, and the rest is also in the plan of relocation,</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Records "Red Flame Market" - The Writing Techniques of a French Film Li Qingya</p>
<p>In China, especially in Shanghai, French films are not generally noticed by those who pay attention to films. This phenomenon certainly has various commercial factors, but another fundamental factor is that the general public's love for American films is like their love for jazz music, both stemming from the same type of motivation. Therefore, French films, like symphonic music, are only considered by a few art enthusiasts to be cultural crystallizations with their own life in the film and music worlds.</p>
<p>The French are a nation that deeply loves art, so they are particularly able to show a kind of spirit in their comprehensive art works. Of course, there will be no exceptions in their films. The French films that have been shown in China before can prove this point, and the "Red Flame Market," recently made in Paris, especially illustrates the characteristics of French films.</p>
<p>"Red Flame Market" may have the opportunity to come to the Far East. Now, I may as well introduce to readers the French records and criticisms of it.</p>
<p>On May 4, 1897, a terrible fire draped mourning clothes over many famous families in France. On that day, in just ten minutes, the charity department store turned into ashes in the flames, and one hundred and twenty-four ladies and gentlemen in the store encountered the devil of death.</p>
<p>This department store was originally a charity bazaar. That year, its initiators built a temporary building on an open space between two fire residences on Rue Jean-Goujon in Paris to serve as this charity sales office. The entire structure was constructed of wood and fabric, with the fabric resembling two streets from the Middle Ages, with residences and shops. The entire building had a wide facade painted with pine lacquer and many inward-pushing doors, and the roof was covered with tarred rough canvas.</p>
<p>The sales office was managed by housewives and young ladies from many famous families in Paris, the most famous of whom was the Duchess of Alençon. Therefore, the richness of the scene need not be described further. In particular, the curiosity of Parisians was attracted by the screening of moving pictures, which the advertisement at the time called "the strange invention of the century, capable of performing illusions of real life, recently successfully produced by Mr. Louis Lumière."</p>
<p>Who would have thought that on this day, the 4th, when thousands of customers were bustling through the narrow aisles of the department store, a cry suddenly burst out in the projection room: Fire!</p>
<p>It turned out that the light-emitting body for the projection was a rod-shaped lime essence burned to white heat with an oxyether flame. At this time, the set of tools exploded. In less than three to five minutes, the flames devoured the tarred canvas, and the canvas immediately collapsed onto the wood and fabric that made up the building. This was truly an indescribable horror. Crowds of people rushed towards the exit, but the inward-opening doors closed under the outward pushing force, thus preventing people from exiting the burning market—since that day, French regulations have stipulated that the doors of public places must open outwards.</p>
<p>Several other exits were properly opened, but the speed of the disaster, the high temperature, and the thick smoke all hindered the firefighters.</p>
<p>In about ten minutes, everything was burned. One hundred and seventeen women and girls, five men, and two boys were all burned into charcoal.</p>
<p>This unexpected disaster inspired Mr. Paul Meurisse, the screenwriter known for the films "The Heart Within" and "The Servant Who Looks Like the Master," to recreate the tragic scene of the charity department store in a new film called "Red Flame Market."</p>
<p>In the scenery, the era is 1894. A painter named Claude, who is a resident of the slums, meets a young bourgeois female artist, Agnès. Their pastoral melodies have been exhibited in various artistic circles of Montmartre in those years, in the Sacré-Cœur Basilica, which was still under construction at the time, and in the luxurious and fashionable cafes of the time.</p>
<p>This young couple eventually get married. Claude often takes his wife to upper-class entertainment venues. But in an era when Agnès has always held the position of a talented artist praised by those around her, Claude, tempted by a bit of lucky success, has commercialized himself and started a business. He quarreled with Agnès several times due to professional jealousy, and she finally abandoned him.</p>
<p>During this period, the initiators of the charity department store, in order to enrich their merchandise, sought an oil painting from Agnès through Claude. However, this hurt Claude's self-esteem, so he only took out one of her early works. On May 4, 1897, Claude went to Rue Jean-Goujon to visit the auction. He met Agnès in the market, and in order to avoid a disturbance, he led her to a dressing room and locked her in. But the fire broke out, and Claude, who was in the midst of the terrified crowd, was not strong enough, and he could not rescue the unfortunate ginger from the flames.</p>
<p>Although he himself was saved, in his forty years of life, he always regretted his initial actions. Finally, he met the god of death in a fire in a large department store in Paris in 1937.</p>
<p>Jean Gabin, who plays Claude in this film, is extremely natural, and Seraphine Dujardin, who plays Agnès, can be called a genius of the early soil film. Claude's close friend, Mr. Martin, played by Jean Darcante, is indeed able to capture the phlegmatic humor.</p>
<p>The musical work is done by Maurice Thiriet, and the scores in it can indeed create an atmosphere that is extremely suitable for the various scenes of this tragicomic drama. However, the main compelling force of this film is the fire in the department store, which can make those audiences who have truly experienced the horror and the impression of the flames on life feel deep pain in a quarter of an hour.</p>
<p>During the set design, Meurisse and his collaborators actually recreated the authentic equipment of the charity department store in the photography studio. And the extras on stage were all carefully selected because they all had considerable agility to escape safely from the flames. In France, this is truly the first time.</p>
<p>Some of the hours in terror were captured from certain corners of this installation that were set on fire and immediately extinguished. Therefore, when many cameras recorded the fire from various angles, the entire installation finally came together.</p>
<p>However, this set, in less than a quarter of an hour, was buried in the flames, just like the fire on Rue Jean-Goujon fifty years ago—where a church has now been built to commemorate it.</p>
<p>From the story of this film, we can already see the extraordinary writing skills of the screenwriter. As for the arrangement of the plot, the coordination of the scenes, and even the selection of talents, it can certainly make people see its comprehensiveness in art. I very much hope that we in Shanghai can have the opportunity to appreciate it.</p>
<p>Night Huang Yun</p>
<p>Child: Do you like the night? Don't you feel the terror of the night? Can you imagine those stories and legends that belong to the night!</p>
<p>In this world, the authority of the night is everywhere; the daytime also reflects the darkness of the night, and is even more terrible than the night.</p>
<p>The night we exist in is when the daytime dies, no, the daytime should be dead forever.</p>
<p>Child: Are you palpitating? I have already tried that your hand is trembling very hard. Don't be afraid, it is our shadows that the green lamp reflects on the white wall. Look at the white moth beside the lamp, it will make a sacrifice to this light. Everyone loves the light, but why is this world too suffocating and too bleak?</p>
<p>Open the dusty wooden window! Take a look at the night outside, how deep it is, you see: the sky is very cloudy, there is no moon, and no stars; it looks like it is going to rain. Look at the winter jasmine and holly trees beside the wall, swaying in the night wind, darker and darker. This wind is a bit cool, and spring cold is most likely to hurt people.</p>
<p>Sit down, come closer to me, let me tell you a story of the night. Do you know how hard the travelers in the dark night are trekking? In the wilderness, in the forest, in the valley... the phosphorus fire of those ancient tombs. The wind whistles in the forest and the wolves howl in the valley; the road is rugged and difficult to walk, and under the valley is a deep and rapid current. If you are not careful, you will lose your life.</p>
<p>You say that the dark night is full of ghosts, but the traveler will not be confused by ghosts, because the devils of the dark night are very kind, only the devils of the daytime are very fierce. Have you heard the legend of ghosts? Ghosts have emotions that are more sincere and passionate than humans.</p>
<p>——Under this green lamp, perhaps</p>
<p>a figure will come in, do you feel scared? In your cold world, there are crowds of people who are more vicious than ghosts...</p>
<p>Listen: it's raining outside, the raindrops are not knocking on the window, this night is too desolate and lonely. Okay! Let me tell you another story of a ghost in a rainy night. ——In a rainy night like now, it was an ancient castle close to a deserted tomb. On this night, a traveler from afar stayed in this ancient castle. He had traveled thousands of mountains and rivers to get here. On a rainy night, he sat under the green lamp looking at the oil paintings on the walls. This old house was full of mystery and horror. Suddenly, he heard a subtle cry from the ancient tomb outside. At this time, the iron horse in the corner of the house was ringing ding-dong, and the phoenix trees outside the window were making a rustling sound from the wind and rain.</p>
<p>There was a soft sound of footsteps outside, the door gradually opened, and a huge black hand stretched in...</p>
<p>Oh! Are you afraid? If so, then I won't tell you anymore. Don't be afraid, no ghosts will come tonight.</p>
<p>The night is not over yet, you hope for dawn, but true dawn will not come out. In the night, a quiet life is happiness!</p>
<p>Listen: the rain and the night watch outside, isn't the old night watchman's pace far away? …………</p>
<p>A Poem Gifted with Tang Yun's Portrait Bai Jiao</p>
<p>Qian Lingxiu Zhong Dashi, Dashi was young and now Lingbo; the ups and downs of rivers and mountains get rid of traces, calling for ink, playful and winning the first seat; when the interest comes, the ancient temple is full of books, too lazy to exchange for gold. Seeing off guests, I go on a boat to Fuyang, looking at the mountains, getting people is like seeing immortals; the group books in the chest open the old Zen, the deities under the pen are noble and contemporary sages; countless works are released, forming ancient joy, there is often no rice in the heart at night and often wide; I know filial piety and friendship are rooted in nature, and discussions are heard about people's illnesses; poems are not often made, talent wins itself, eyes are low but powerful, the heart is like a mirror, the teacher's reputation for painting is great, and ten thousand readers are worthy of testifying. I painted this for Mr. as a gift, and I'm waiting for the watch to express my feelings. (Made for Yun's painting exhibition)</p>
<p>Ink Bamboo Liu Zigu</p>
<p>Staying Overnight in a Mountain Village Song Zhuping</p>
<p>At night, the cold wind once again rolls up the clear snow on the ground, lightly striking the window paper, the lamplight shaking in solitude, outside is a boundless blue sky and solemn black night, a pile of embers accompanies me, and strands of lonely feeling suddenly float to my heart, surrounded by frightening dead silence, cold. It should be late at night now, right!</p>
<p>I still vaguely remember: last year, at this time, on such a night. ——</p>
<p>At that time, I was on a strenuous mountain journey on foot. It was also such a night. I was reluctant to hurry on my way and missed the inn. In winter, as soon as dusk came, the night quietly descended. When I was still lovingly watching the barren West Mountain, dyed with the faint red of the setting sun, the stars had already filled the sky. The night sky is full of beautiful sentiment, but the mountain wind is howling, also just clear snow, the oncoming fierce wind and sand, and the biting cold, I am a little afraid, this area is the haunt of green forest heroes. Finally, in this mountain where I couldn't see any signs of human habitation, I found a small shop. You must congratulate me, yes, at that time, even I myself secretly and deeply congratulated myself on my good luck.</p>
<p>I knocked on the door of the small shop. The small shop had no more than three rooms in total. There were no guests staying there. Only the shopkeeper himself was sitting around the firewood on the ground. A warm air greeted me, and a dim oil lamp was lit in the corner of the wall. These made me forget how humble the small shop was. I leaned my crutch against the wall, threw my only small luggage on the earthen bed, and then patted the dust off my body and sat opposite the shopkeeper, also getting close to the fire.</p>
<p>We sat silently, neither of us thought of speaking. Only the dry firewood crackled softly, embellishing the coldness of the air. I buried my head and just warmed myself by the fire. When I was warm all over, I raised my head. I was almost stunned. The shopkeeper was staring at me fiercely. He was wearing a blue cotton-padded jacket, with an old felt hat on his head, his face full of beards, his iron-green face was illuminated by the raging firewood and became a miserable green, his eyes were full of bloodshot eyes, and I seemed to have seen his sharp gaze in some unusual place. Suddenly, I couldn't help but shiver, and I thought nervously and uneasily: He is doing the business of killing people and stealing goods! So, I have fallen into a black shop. Everything in front of me is dark, filled with cruelty, coldness, and viciousness, painted into a bloody picture.</p>
<p>After another silent moment, I suppressed my heartbeat, avoided his gaze, and cautiously began to chat with him, inquiring about some unimportant things about him. He only hummed with his nasal voice. Finally, when he seemed a little tired and yawned, I deliberately and unintentionally told him: "There is a team of Lala soldiers (Note) behind us. If we can't catch up with the lunch in the morning, I'm afraid we will have to have breakfast here tomorrow morning."</p>
<p>This time he finally opened his mouth: "Will they arrive tomorrow morning?" This voice was a bit like the hiss of a wounded beast. I was extremely afraid of hearing this kind of voice, and I timidly nodded to him, feeling a shiver of numbness in my heart. We were silent again.</p>
<p>Before I went to sleep, when I was lying on the earthen bed, I deliberately revealed my simple and worn luggage to him. He enthusiastically filled another handful of burning wheat straw into the earthen bed for me. All night, I was lying on the scorching earthen bed, vaguely awake with an uneasy mood, repeatedly listening to the north wind rolling up the clear snow and lightly striking the window paper, and thinking in fear: He shouldn't be plotting against me, right?</p>
<p>The next day, the stars were still very bright, and the crescent moon hung gracefully on the eastern treetops. I hurriedly got up, left the small shop, and began my mountain journey again, carrying my small luggage. I walked twenty miles on the rugged mountain road full of frozen snow. On another mountain top, I joyfully greeted the dawn. The east turned white, and in the haze, it was still shining with dazzling golden light.</p>
<p>When the sun came out, my heart also melted in the warm sunshine. Last night was really a nightmare, and I also started to tell a lie, smiling at my nervousness at the first sun.</p>
<p>(Note) It is a large rubber-wheeled cart pulled by three or four animals. In the Northwest, it is almost a more important means of transportation than trucks.</p>

<p>Night Sounds Wei Xiaoping</p>
<p>In everyday life, there are more profound tragic elements than in the tragedies of major events. ——Maeterlinck:</p>
<p>I am most afraid of spending this night,</p>
<p>Whenever I see the footsteps of night stepping on my head, my whole body turns cold, and I can't suppress the surge of confusion and bewilderment.</p>
<p>In the night, a plaintive voice occasionally floats past the window, which once triggered my homesickness as a wanderer. But whenever I think of the cries of "mung bean porridge" in my hometown, there were also cries of "fried rice sugar water" for sale in Sichuan, which are so lingering and unforgettable, but now they have changed to:</p>
<p>"Spiced eggs"!</p>
<p>I dare not say that this sound is necessarily good or bad, but I always feel that it is too desolate, and the desolation makes it difficult for people to listen to it for a long time, like what a foreign missionary heard in Guangzhou in the past: "Selling - salty! Sand! Pears" as if thinking, as if admiring, as if weeping, as if complaining, one can't help but feel a surge of compassion and sympathy.</p>
<p>But tonight, I didn't hear this sound.</p>
<p>The wind has picked up again outside. Click, click, from the swirling wind that echoes against the crooked blue walls, a burst of wind is whipping the doors and windows, and also startling the barking of dogs. The dog seems to have already sensed something. It seems to be catching up with the past, barking fiercely, and then retreating and whimpering, and then suddenly attacking forward again...</p>
<p>I can't calm down, my heart is jumping uneasily, guessing: "Is this going to cause trouble?"</p>
<p>Quietly pushing open the window, the night is a sea surging with black mist, dark and heavy, opening its big mouth, swallowing everything, even me, even my eyes. There is only one star of light, shining in from the alley, pale green, flickering and expanding is it a will-o'-the-wisp? A firefly?</p>
<p>A few monotonous footsteps, and another urgent dog barking.</p>
<p>"Hey, is it a human or a ghost?" I stretched my head out and shouted, raising my voice</p>
<p>"Hmm?" A furious reply from outside the window. "Of course it's a human."</p>
<p>"What are you doing?"</p>
<p>"Selling spiced eggs"!</p>
<p>"Ah! It's you, why don't you shout?" I was happy, as if drifting in the vast sea for many years, and met an old friend again. But then I thought: "Egg seller, are you sick?" The night before, when I bought from him, the clothes he was wearing were tattered, his eyes were sunken, his voice was hoarse, and I felt that this person would be tormented by life.</p>
<p>I thought of indescribable sadness, and walked out the door following my legs, as if sinking in ice, I could only struggle out through the heavy pressure in my throat with sobs.</p>
<p>"Are you sick?" I asked.</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>"Then why don't you shout?"</p>
<p>He pointed to the outside of the alley, where it seemed to have a pair of night hawk's eyes, which would make these idle people tremble. He said: "They don't let me make a sound."</p>
<p>"Is there trouble? No wonder the dog is barking so hard."</p>
<p>He laughed instead, laughing coldly: "There they say they want to hunt down bad people... Bad people coming out at night,"</p>
<p>I didn't quite understand.</p>
<p>He only blinked his eyes, and then dropped a painful sigh: "There's no way. Who doesn't live for life. Look at me, sir, our family, old and young, all rely on earning this little money to live on. Night, chaos, bad people, all are just..."</p>
<p>"Bang"! A gunshot! The dog barked even louder.</p>
<p>Many hurried footsteps running, "Catch him, catch him". Someone shouted, and a sudden woman's cry drowned that out.</p>
<p>"They caught a bad guy again! Male? Female? Alas, alas!" The egg seller seemed to be calm. He bent down and twisted the lamp head, and the flame rose with it. In the lamplight, I saw again that dull face that had lost the vitality of a human.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but agitate and say: "Now you can open your throat and shout."</p>
<p>He said: "It's very difficult, very difficult, things at night are uncertain."</p>
<p>He left, moving his steps with difficulty, and walked past.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes wide in this night.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>The Summer of Beibei Hot Springs in the Temporary Capital Peng Dehan</p>
<p>"Beibei Hot Springs" is one of the scenic spots in the suburbs of the temporary capital. It is the most beautiful scenery among the famous "Four Great Hot Springs". Three years ago, dignitaries, wealthy merchants, and giants almost all came here to escape the summer heat. The beautiful Western-style buildings in Beibei Hot Springs Park are the relics of the past. The Chongqing Summer Camp in 1943 was also held in the deep green shade of "Beibei Hot Springs".</p>
<p>Jinyun Mountain is above it. The emerald-like Jialing River cuts off the Jinyun Mountain Range, and flows between the thousand-foot cliffs. The stone teeth at the bottom of the water and the valley wind on the river stir up turbulent waves. The waves hit the towering rocks beside the mountains, and the pine trees on the mountains and the whispering hot springs interweave an endless song. The reflections of the red peach blossoms on the banks are set against the rugged white stones under the green stream, reflecting the swaying dance posture. Because the rocks in the western and central parts collapsed into the river, forming a terrace dozens of acres in size, the north and south ends embrace the rock walls on the east bank, forming this beautiful scenery in the southwest—Beibei Hot Springs.</p>
<p>The verdant pines and cypresses are transformed into a dark velvet curtain. Strange flowers and herbs are laid flat on this beautiful scenery like patterns, and surrounded by red walls and green tiles, carved beams and painted pillars of palaces and temples, and exquisite pavilions, walking in the cypress-lined trails, or lying on the green lawn, looking up at the blue and boundless sky, with a few floating clouds, the red light of the setting sun, shooting on the white edges, becoming golden borders, the various changing beautiful scenery in the sky, reflecting the summer of Beibei Hot Springs, making tourists feel a reluctance to leave this scene.</p>
<p>The hot spring pool in the hot spring bath is founded by the management office of Beibei Hot Springs Park. Tourists are like shuttles under Beibei Hot Springs Park, next to the Jialing River. It is a new-style bathing place rebuilt using temples. The door is inscribed with the words "Dust Removal", which is very appropriate. The bathing place is divided into three parts: single room, inner pool, and outer pool. The bath ticket for a single room is 500 yuan, while the outer pool of the open-air swimming pool only costs 250 yuan. Compared with the soaring prices, it is indeed a popular and mass-oriented paradise.</p>
<p>Several tourists are climbing the White Bird Pavilion at the high point of Beibei Hot Springs Park, climbing up the stone steps next to the Zhenwa Hall. Standing on the White Bird Pavilion, you can appreciate the lines of the poem "Shu Mountain is green and Shu Mountain is beautiful", and you will feel the greatness and tenderness of the mountains and rivers of Beibei Hot Springs; your emotions will be entrusted to the green mountains and entrusted to the green water. You can clearly see the Beibei Hot Springs Park between the green mountains and the silk water. Flowers bloom and fall, and the park becomes a patterned painting that changes with the seasons. On the pavilion are the seven characters "Green Mountains and Green Waters White Bird Pavilion" inscribed by President Yu Youren.</p>
<p>Dusk, only at dusk, is the most memorable moment in Beibei Hot Springs. Any place is a beautiful shot worth remembering, especially on the Love Nest Pond next to the Great Buddha Hall. Sitting on the small island surrounded by crushed green willows, dark red鲜花, half-mountain and half-water, all distracting thoughts will be washed away by the beautiful scenery, and all worries will float into the distant sky. The clouds and smoke of Jinyun Mountain linger, and the waves of the Jialing River are turbulent. Beibei Hot Springs at the foot of Jinyun Mountain and on the bank of the Jialing River is exactly the "summer" paradise and the "summer" paradise. The hot summer makes the entire temporary capital city covered in a sultry atmosphere, but the hot summer cannot dominate the Beibei Hot Springs in the northern suburbs of the temporary capital.</p>
<p>Secrets of the Moon Void Person</p>
<p>Everything on the moon was originally a secret, but due to the progress of science, this secret has gradually been revealed.</p>
<p>There is no air on the moon at all. If a person comes to the moon from the earth, he will immediately explode due to the pressure in his body.</p>
<p>Many things on Earth also exist on the moon, such as deserts, grasslands, mountains, and volcanoes, but there are no living things, oceans, or rivers, and not even a drop of water can be found.</p>
<p>One day on the moon is equal to two weeks on Earth, and its night is also as long as two weeks on Earth. The temperature difference between day and night on the moon is extremely large. The sun's rays reach the earth after passing through the atmosphere, but the sun's rays reach the moon directly. Therefore, at noon, if you put a pot of ice water on the rocks on the moon exposed to sunlight, it will boil in a minute or two. At this time, if there are humans on the moon, they can only hide in the rock caves that sunlight cannot reach. Once night falls, the heat of the moon is rapidly radiated into the air, and the temperature drops so much that any liquid can turn into ice. At this time, people can only survive by wearing insulated clothing.</p>
<p>The "moon's gravity" on the surface of the moon is only one-fifth of the earth's gravity. Therefore, everything on Earth will lose four-fifths of its weight after coming to the moon. For example, a person weighing two hundred pounds will only weigh forty pounds on the moon.</p>
<p>Humans will be able to go to the moon in the future. The means of transportation may be rockets. However, the engine of the rocket carrying people to the moon must use atomic energy as fuel, and the speed of the rocket must reach ten miles per second. The average distance between the moon and the earth is about two million miles. Using such a rocket to carry people to the moon will only take three or four days to reach the moon.</p>
<p>Today, the most precious metal in the world is rare things like "uranium", but according to scientists' research, due to the special rock and geological structure on the moon, a large amount of uranium ore and other radioactive metals are buried on the moon. Therefore, in the future, atomic energy can be used in large quantities on the moon to build cities, so that humans can live on the moon. For example, use atomic energy to extract oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen from the minerals on the moon to supply air and water, use atomic energy to supply heating and light, and regulate the atmospheric temperature.</p>
<p>If the moon can be controlled, the entire earth can be completely controlled militarily, because the "moon's gravity" is four-fifths smaller than the earth's gravity. From the moon, fire-preemptive bombs can be used to bomb any place on the earth very conveniently, the aiming force is very accurate, and the degree of destruction is very large, but it is thousands of times more difficult to bomb the moon from the earth, because the earth's gravity is five times greater than the moon's gravity. Therefore, in the future atomic age, ambitious military aggressors will not only control important strategic areas on the earth, but also try to occupy the moon as the foundation for conquering the world.</p>
<p>Between China and Japan Bao Qing</p>
<p>China The 19th anniversary of the "Jinan Massacre". Master Mai allowed the Japanese government offices, parliament, and imperial palace to re-hang the Japanese flag from now on.</p>
<p>The bronze statue of the "Three Brave Soldiers of the Flesh Bomb" commemorating the aftermath of the January 28 Shanghai Battle in Japan still stands.</p>
<p>Among the national humiliation souvenirs in the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, only the anchor chain and shells have been retrieved. The two anchors are still being negotiated for transportation. As for other Chinese military equipment such as general cannons, dragon flags, naval public office pictures, and local officials' virtue monuments, their whereabouts are still unknown.</p>
<p>Salt is the main raw material for industry. The large amount of salt exported from China to Japan is in response to Master Mai's requirements to take care of the people's food. Moreover, Master Mai also allowed Japan to fish in the Chinese Sea and restore the textile industry, which infringes on China's Huai industry and hinders China's textile industry. Li Zhuchu said; it is no different from feeding the tiger that invaded China with the milk of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>At the Far East International Military Tribunal, the prosecutors of the United States, China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and other eleven countries accused Japanese Class A war criminals in a public prosecution indictment, listing 54 crimes. There were 18 cases related to China, including: one case of plotting to loot East Asia, the Pacific Ocean, and the Indian Ocean, one case of conspiring to invade our country, four cases of launching aggression against our country, six cases of attacking our country's local areas and carrying out murders, and four cases of contempt for international law, scheming, executing, or failing to prevent the killing or mistreatment of prisoners of war and civilians.</p>
<p>Caring for the Motherland Liu Meng</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese in Penang sent a telegram to Shen Bao on the 6th, expressing their concern for the student unrest that has repeatedly occurred in the motherland, and their feelings are profound. The first passenger plane on the China-America route of Pan American Airlines in the United States also brought a wreath from overseas Chinese in San Francisco to offer to the tomb of the founding father of the country. A telegram, a wreath, is not worth much, but its meaning is very deep, fully showing the love of overseas Chinese for the motherland.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese care about the motherland very much. On the one hand, it is because the Chinese people's love for their homeland is very deep. The ancients also said, "Entrusting oneself to a foreign country is what the ancients grieved"; on the other hand, it is also because of the unequal treatment they have received overseas, so their concern for governance is deeper than anyone else's.</p>
<p>Roosevelt's Legacy Arlin</p>
<p>According to a New York dispatch from this newspaper on the 6th, the executor of Roosevelt's estate submitted a liquidation report to the Surrogate Court today. When Roosevelt passed away on April 12, 1945, the value of his estate was 1.94 million US dollars, of which 990,000 US dollars were obtained from his mother's inheritance. Due to the repayment of debts and other expenses, the actual total amount is now 1.43 million US dollars.</p>
<p>This is the wealth of Roosevelt as a great man in modern times. Except for what he inherited, his lifetime income was only 400,000 US dollars. Compared with the wealth figures of the 60 richest families in the United States, it is really insignificant. Probably, here "serving as an official and then becoming rich" is a rule in the East, but for Roosevelt, it loses its meaning.</p>
<p>From this, we can also see the distinction between the great and the mediocre. The mediocre devote their lives to their own private interests, so what they leave behind is huge wealth, while the great devote themselves to the great cause of the masses, and their legacy is therefore a contribution to mankind and a construction of the world. Therefore, the estate of 40,000 US dollars (if the annual interest of his mother's inheritance is deducted, it will be far less than this amount) is not worth mentioning. For Roosevelt, there is a greater legacy.</p>
<p>This legacy is the contribution to mankind and the contribution to the world that we praise. In this century, we feel that World War II has produced two glorious results. One is national self-determination, which is the achievement of President Wilson in 1919, and the other is economic Democracy, the foresight of President Roosevelt. Using economic democracy to stabilize the world is Roosevelt's cause, and it is also the great cause he has left to this world. As for the previous promotion of international unity, in today's chaotic international situation, we feel Roosevelt's greatness even more.</p>
<p>It is truly economic Democracy, so the wealth Roosevelt left behind is only at the tail end of the 60 richest families in the United States. It is truly because he is a figure of an era, so what he has left to this world is a cause of promoting stability, peace, and prosperity. This cause has more necessity and value than a sum of wealth.</p>
<p>Talking about Hu Zhantang Xu Ren</p>
<p>Revolutionary veteran Hu Zhantang has been dead for eleven years, making people have infinite nostalgia for this great politician.</p>
<p>Mr.'s name is "Hanmin", because when the Manchu Qing Dynasty was coming to an end, Mr. was following the father of the country to engage in revolution. He thought that the Manchu Qing were Huren, and his own surname happened to be "Hu", which he regarded as a shameful thing, but the surname could not be changed, so he named himself "Hanmin", indicating that he was a son of the Han family:</p>
<p>When he was the President of the Legislative Yuan, the capital and Shanghai were close to each other. Every Saturday, the important people of the capital went to Shanghai for a short rest, which had become a habit. At that time, it was called "weekend travel" in public opinion. Only Hu Guangsheng had never been to Shanghai in the five or six years after the capital of the National Government was established in Nanjing. It was not until the 20th year when he went to Guangdong via Shanghai to resolve the war that he went to Shanghai for the first time after the capital was established, and it was also the last time he went to Shanghai, because he died in Guangzhou afterwards.</p>
<p>He hated the existence of colonial-style foreign concessions in the big cities of China. Therefore, his footsteps never set foot in the concession in his life. This and Wu Peifu's creed of "not living in the concession after failure" echoed each other.</p>
<p>A certain wife bought a pair of foreign silk machines for thirty yuan, which was a very extravagant behavior under the price at the time. When Mr. Hu found out about it, he specially raised this matter at the Central Memorial Week and severely rebuked her. It was once spread as a good story.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu and Wang Jingwei were both veterans of the Kuomintang, but there was no harmony between Hu and Wang. Mr. Hu always despised Wang's personality. In the 20th year, Mr. Hu went to Guangdong from the capital, passing through Shanghai. Wang Jingwei happened to return to Shanghai from abroad. Hu and Wang, who had been separated for several years, shook hands and met; after Wang said goodbye and left, Mr. Hu hurriedly called people to fetch a basin of water to wash his hands, saying, "It has soiled my hands"! Wang Jingwei later surrendered to Japan and became a traitor, which proves that Mr. Hu's knowledge of people is not false.</p>
<p>The four elders of the National Government are all known by their courtesy names, namely Hu Zhantang, Yu Youren, Tan Yankai, and Niu Yongjian. Their calligraphy styles are different. Hu's calligraphy is thin, tall and upright, with hard bones and ridges. The characters are like the person. Seeing his characters will remind you of his integrity in doing things.</p>

<p>Using this method of coaxing in every way, Old Zhu spent another hour with her like years. He finally hoped that the train would stop at a very small station called Kansai. Many of the stronger passengers jumped off the train one after another to walk and rest. Although Zhu Zhaonian knew very well the value of this horizontal wood like a tree branch, it might be snatched by others if he left, but for Feifei's illness, he felt that he had to quickly take her down to breathe some fresh air. At the same time, he also wanted to find several companions in the group who had some medical knowledge to see what kind of illness the child was suffering from, and whether she would also be infected with typhus like her mother?</p>
<p>He resolutely got off the train. At this time, the group member surnamed Feng had brought a bowl of boiling water. Old Zhu held Feifei and first sat down on the platform without a canopy. While telling him to put the boiling water aside, he asked him to quickly find those group members who knew some medicine.</p>
<p>Now, Feifei is just drowsy, and her palms and forehead are a little hot. Old Zhu also knows that this is definitely not a minor illness, but besides trying to pour boiling water for her to drink, he can't think of any good way for a while. Kansai is just a very,</p>
<h3>Shipping Industry Requests Representative to Join Japan Study Mission</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Steamship Owners' Association believes that the shipping industry is an important sector of commerce. Business study missions from various countries typically include multiple representatives from the shipping industry, demonstrating the importance these countries place on shipping. Post-war reconstruction in our country urgently requires significant development of the shipping industry, and a deep understanding of Japanese commerce and shipping is particularly necessary. Regarding the government's upcoming business study mission to Japan, the association's chairman, Du, has sent a telegram in his name to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Transportation, requesting that two representatives be nominated to participate, in order to study the actual conditions of the Japanese shipping industry and provide a reference for the development of our national shipping industry.</p>

<h3>Bao Feng Money Exchange Allegedly Defrauded, Large Loss of Gold and US Dollars ·Military and Police Authorities Decide to Immediately Send Personnel to Investigate Thoroughly·</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Yesterday, rumors spread throughout the money exchange industry that four men, each carrying a handgun, came to the Bao Feng Money Exchange at 204 Nanjing East Road. They claimed to be under orders to search for illegal gold and dollar transactions. After showing their identification, they entered the exchange's inner room and took away eight large gold bars, over one thousand US dollars, and some account books and checkbooks. They also intended to take the manager, Liu Ji, away, but after Liu pleaded, they left with the money in a pre-arranged car heading east. When a reporter went to the exchange yesterday to inquire, Liu was out. An apprentice at the exchange revealed that the amount lost was not as large as rumored. When asked, the exchange's staff all denied the incident. The reporter also inquired with Xu Youzuo, the chief of the police bureau's economic division, and the inspection office of the garrison command, who both stated that they had heard of the incident, but no personnel had been dispatched to the aforementioned location for a search today (i.e., yesterday). It is believed that the perpetrators were impersonating officials, and it was decided that personnel would be dispatched today to investigate thoroughly.</p>
<h3>Certificates Issued to Seven Councilors Concurrently Serving as Principals of Public Schools</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The election certificates for the city councilors Chai Zifei, Li Shuzi, Yang Minghui, Tao Guangchuan, Sun Zhenchun, Zhou Feicheng, and Wang Liben were previously delayed due to their concurrent positions as principals of public schools. It is now learned that the Ministry of Interior has followed the recent interpretation of the Central Government, and before the election laws are amended, they may still concurrently serve as city councilors. The Ministry of Interior has telegraphed the city council, and the election certificates have been filled out and submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Government for distribution. However, it remains to be determined whether the situation of councilor Xu Ze, who is currently the director of the Municipal People's Education Center, will be interpreted in the same way as principals of public schools, and the Executive Yuan must be requested to provide instructions.</p>
<h3>Funding for Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Superhighway Still Not Secured</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] According to a spokesperson for the Shanghai Office of the Highway Administration, the main task since the establishment of this office has been to receive equipment from the Executive Headquarters. Although much has been received over the past year, most of the machinery is incomplete and cannot be assembled and used, and is currently stored in Zhenru. The planned Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Superhighway has not yet started due to a lack of funding. The Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, which has been repaired and opened to traffic, is again full of potholes, but due to a lack of funds for repairs, it is being left to nature. As for other provincial roads, they should be repaired by the provinces themselves, and the Highway Administration cannot take care of them.</p>
<h3>Fake Mailman Arrested for Extorting Petty Fees</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Yang Yanhua, a local resident, 25 years old, was formerly a guerrilla in Pudong. In May of last year, he was hired by the post office as a mailman, but was laid off at the end of the year due to some reason and has been unemployed ever since. Recently, unable to make a living, he used his original green mailman uniform and forged a copper number plate with the number 752 to extort petty fees from dozens of households, including the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), the Lianyi Foreign Firm, the Yufeng Shen Exchange, the Xinchengxiang Shen Exchange, the Asia East Enterprise Company, and the Great America Theater, totaling over two million yuan. The day before yesterday, he went to the Great Shanghai Theater on Tibet Road to extort fees. The theater staff asked him to come back the next afternoon and reported it to the 13th Postal Branch, which sent personnel to verify the impersonation. He was arrested the next day and sent to the Lao Zha Police Branch for investigation.</p>
<h3>Zhao Zukang Returns from Meeting, Discusses Resolutions Related to Municipal Water Conservancy</h3>

<h3>Engine Failed Twice, Crew Did Not Recognize Flag Signals, Struggled in the Storm for Hours Before Finally Sinking, Passengers of the Da Feng Vessel Give Detailed Account</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nantong, 12th] The Da Feng steamship sailed from Shanghai on the 8th and encountered a tragic accident after being attacked by strong winds and huge waves. Yesterday, a rescued passenger told our reporter in detail about what happened. According to him, "The Da Feng vessel had been in disrepair for a long time, the interior was dilapidated, many of the parts were incomplete, and the cabins often leaked water. After departing from Shanghai at 11 p.m. on the 8th, it was discovered that the piston in the engine had been damaged when it arrived at Lion Grove at 2:20 a.m. on the 9th, and it immediately dropped anchor and stopped moving forward. Then, at around 5 a.m., it was suddenly attacked by a violent storm and waves, and the ship body shook violently, causing all the passengers to vomit continuously. At that time, some of the passengers requested to return to Shanghai, but the ship owner refused. Around 8 a.m., the situation became even worse, and a large amount of river water flowed into the ship, and the ship's bottom pump also broke down. After repairs, it sailed back to Wusong. After sailing for about half an hour, the ship's engine failed again. At that time, the captain, seeing the critical situation, urgently telegraphed the company in Shanghai for help. It was about 9 o'clock, the ship's body was tilting, and the passengers were shouting loudly, causing chaos. Until 11 a.m., an oil tanker numbered 128 approached the area and saw that the situation of the Da Feng vessel was critical, so it signaled with flags. However, no one on the Da Feng vessel recognized the flag signals, so they could not reply, and only hung the flag upside down to indicate an emergency. At 12:05 p.m., they received a reply from the company saying that two large water boats had been sent to rescue them. However, they had not arrived by 1:10 p.m., and the Da Feng vessel could no longer hold on, and the ship's body gradually sank, and the passengers all crawled from the bottom to the top of the ship, and the situation was extremely dangerous. At 1:30, the ship tilted to the left, and all the crew members were already wearing life jackets, and some of the passengers had already sunk into the water. I wore an extra life jacket and knew how to swim a little, so I was spared from disaster. After struggling for a while, I saw a rescue boat on the river surface approaching quickly. The boat was the oil tanker numbered 128, but before the oil tanker arrived, the Da Feng vessel had completely sunk, and the scene of the passengers sinking was too horrible to look at. When the oil tanker arrived, I was fortunate enough to be rescued first, but because I struggled in the water for too long and exerted too much effort, I vomited blood after getting on the boat, and later returned to Shanghai for medical treatment. As far as I know, there were 50 soldiers on board in addition to ordinary passengers who had not purchased tickets. In addition to those who were rescued, the number of victims must be over one hundred. Among those rescued, nine more died."</p>
<p>Families of Victims Schedule Meeting to Discuss Aftermath</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nantong, 12th] After the sinking of the Da Feng vessel, public opinion here is in an uproar, and all believe that the company is undeniably responsible. The families of the victims have issued a notice scheduling a meeting to jointly plan the aftermath.</p>
<h3>Floating Corpses Found in River</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] After the Da Feng vessel encountered wind and sank in the Liuhekou River, passengers who arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the Jiang Kang and Jiang Li vessels reported that they saw several drowned corpses floating on the river surface when passing through the Lion Grove River. After being informed, the Da Feng Shipping Bureau dispatched the Shen Yuan vessel to the Wusongkou Lion Grove River at 5 p.m. to salvage the corpses and bring personnel from the Shangzhuang Villa to collect them. At the same time, over 20 family members of the passengers also went on the vessel to identify the bodies.</p>
<h3>The Yamazaki Hotel Bloodbath Behind the Scenes ··Seemingly a Page from a Spy History</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Wu Wen, the protagonist of the Yamazaki Hotel bloodbath, which was a sensation during the enemy-puppet period, was on trial yesterday in the Ordinary Criminal Court of the High Court. Wu's confession of the details was as follows: He is from Zhongshan, Guangdong, a doctor of Western medicine, and had studied in the United States and Japan. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served as a commissioner in the Nanjing District of the Allied Military Intelligence Service. In the 31st year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1942], he practiced medicine in Nanjing under the guise of a sign to cover his activities. He met a woman named Cao Xiuzhen (i.e., the deceased). Cao was once married to a Chen, so she was also known as Chen, and she had been his student when she was young. Because Cao's husband had passed away and he was also widowed, they developed a relationship from teacher and student to cohabitation. Cao had a mark like a lotus petal. At that time, she was working as a spy for the enemy [Japanese] organization, which had offered a reward of 200,000 yuan for the arrest of Allied underground workers. Unexpectedly, Cao, blinded by profit, wanted to sell out her underground comrades. In October of the 32nd year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1943], the two came to Shanghai and rented a room in the Yamazaki Hotel in Hongkou. Cao did not listen to his advice, and the two had a dispute. He first covered Cao's mouth with a cloth, and then strangled her with a bathrobe belt. He also said that his motive for killing Cao was purely to protect national military secrets. After the case occurred, Wu was sentenced to death by the District Court, and the puppet High Court changed the sentence to life imprisonment. Later, the puppet government granted amnesty and reduced the sentence to fifteen years. After the victory, the High Prosecutor's Office re-investigated and prosecuted him for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. The case was concluded by the High Court yesterday, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced at 2 p.m. on the 19th.</p>
