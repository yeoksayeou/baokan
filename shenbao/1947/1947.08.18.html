<h3>五項進口物品　准按官價結匯</h3>
<p>行政院核定按官價結匯之進口物品名稱如下：（一）棉花，（二）米，麥，（三）麵粉，（四）煤。（五）煤焦。</p>
<h3>中央銀行　建議要點</h3>
<p>中央銀行對改訂進出口外匯結匯辦法建議要點如下：</p>
<p>查官價匯率，自本年二月十七日改訂以來，因物價不斷上漲，以致匯率與物價之比例，相差過多。至所有官價結匯之進口之貨品，大部份仍係按市優出售，予商人以額外利潤，而無補於物價之平抑。就出口貿易而論，復因官價匯率所限，外銷無利可圖，不惟幾將限於停頓，且恐海外市場將為人　奪。僑匯亦因官價匯率與市價相差太多，相率逃避，影響國際收支，與國計民生至鉅且大。本辦法主要條件，應使外匯在黑市之城要减少。故於進口之走私，尤其在華南各口岸。應顫以制止。似此一面對輸入加強管制，以减少非急要之支付，而對外匯率，可由合法貿易中，尋求較為自然之水準，藉使久經呆滯之出口貿易，得以推動，僑匯亦可减少走漏，使市場外匯供求逐漸相抵。</p>
<h3>美金庫券　仍按官價銷售</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕財政部徐次長柏園，十七日下午八時，出席國行張總栽招待記者席上聲稱：關於美金庫券，仍按照官價銷售，并無更動。</p>
<h3>劉維熾談僑匯</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕僑務委員會委員長劉維熾氏頃對政府改訂外匯管理辦法表示欣慰。劉氏稱，過去因外匯官價與黑市相差過鉅，致僑匯逃避，國家所受損失實屬不可估計。際此出口不振，獲得外匯，僅賴借款一途，但此殊非正當辦法，故對僑匯問題，吾人應予特別重視。劉氏謂，若以僑匯逃避之原因，歸　華僑殊非公允，因照官價結售，華僑損失過大，且在國家立場，自應以公平為原則，故改訂外匯辦法，早有必要，此時實行，已有過遲之感。劉氏認為外匯新辦法，可使政府重新掌握全部僑匯，充裕外匯基金，惟新辦法能否獲得預期之效果，尙須視辦理僑匯機構應付得當與否為斷。劉氏指出民國二十六年僑匯為國幣五億八千萬元，二十七年為七億餘元，僑匯最多時曾達三億美元一年。今後果能恢復戰前之數額，對國家經濟之裨益，決非淺顯。</p>
<h3>澳銀行家伍德　週末來華訪問</h3>
<p>〔中央社雪梨十六日電〕澳大利亞不列顛聯合國銀行外匯管理處主任伍德，將於二十三日飛華，作歷時一月之訪問，以研究中國銀行及通貨問題，蓋二者關涉中澳兩國　將來可能之貿易發展。伍氏將訪問上海，南京，天津，北平，靑島，廣州及其他城市，並將與中國銀行家及官員討論財政貿易問題。渠於訪問中國後，將繼訪問菲利賓，越南，暹　及馬來亞導基地。</p>
<h3>經委黃元彬對記者談　外匯新措施特點　可爲改革幣制過渡辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電」全國糧委會委員黃元彬十七日對記者說，改訂外匯管理及進出口貿易辦法，渠認此為改革幣制最合理之過渡辦法。渠指出該辦法之五項特色：（一）外匯政策應使進口合理出口順利，僑匯不致進港。過去提高外匯辦法，收效極短暫，逾期即行失效。此次所定辦法，名義上非提高外匯，實際則使外匯價得自然調整，恰能解決進出口及僑匯問題，目能繼續收效。（二）此次所訂辦法，規定棉花·糧食·肥料·煤四種·由政府供給，官價外匯總值每年約美金一億五千萬，恰佔進口總值之半，其餘半數為其他進口貨。過去出口貨所得外匯及僑匯，年約美幣二億，除小部僑匯係匯港外，餘正與其他進口貨所需外匯相抵，需求相當，且央行可借墊外匯，故外匯市價不致有飛深現象而可得自然的調整。（三）政府官價外匯供購必需品，其他進口貨則按市價結匯，最為合理。過去如富人消耗汽油係官價供外匯，即是窮人所納之稅，此等現象今後可避免。（四）僑匯無公平市價，結果僑匯流港，適供華南走私之用。新辦法中之市價，與香港黑市相同，僑匯自可不再流港。（五）新辦法可刺激出口貨之生產，進口趨正常，對外貿易可合理調整。黃氏並指出，杜絕僑匯流港，應有兩補充辦法：（一）僑匯匯稟可塡寫外幣匯回本國，並准其自由存入外幣存款，隨時提換法幣。（二）禁止進口貨物須依節約辦法，在一定期限後，全國農屬執行沒收。黃氏末稱，欲使投機杜絕，刺激一般生產與人民就業，仍有待於幣制之改革。</p>

<h3>外匯市塲將趨穩定　樓桐孫談新措施主要目的</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕立法院秘書長褸桐孫十七日接見記者談政府外滙新措施稱，此舉雖嫌稍遲，然仍不失為一適時措施。新政策對進口限制，在精神上較過去嚴格多多。我國始終為一入超國家，國際收支未能平衡，此種揹施當能為眾所諒解。在英國近為求取平衡，亦曾採取緊急性之嚴厲管制。我政府在採取此一措施前，事先曾經縝密研究，對進口曾作估計：（一）棉，（二）米，麵，（三）肥料，（四）煤，煤焦等四種民生必需品。政府擬以官價結滙，總值約為一億六千萬美金，其他煤油，烟葉，木材，燃油等十六種進口物資，其數目約為二億八千二百四十萬美元，二者相加，約為四億四千二百四十萬美金。就出口而言，除大豆，鑛產等與外國以貨易貨外，出口物資約可得一億八千二百四十萬元，再加以僑匯一億美金，外人在　費用　（包括外交辦事人員及慈善團體）費用），估計約三千九百萬，共計三億二千一百四十萬，兩數相比，逆差約為一億二千一百萬，因之黑市似可能受其刺激，然大豆，礦產可得二千一百萬，國際救濟金，二五百萬，益以棉貸之千五百萬一總數亦達一億二千一百萬，政變實際上可獲平衡。同時新辦貨第九條，對進口商與外商治購貨　有嚴格限制，在未取得許可證　，不得與外商接洽。據　氏　　，一切若能推行順利，相當時期後外匯市場定可趨於穩定，外匯穩定後，進出口即可恢復正常，而趨於活躍，國內市場亦可正　。此為此次措施主要目的，尙　中外商人，能了解此點，協助教政府推行國策，以挽救一般人所認之中國經濟危機。樓氏最後並以極有把握之語調告記者，此一措施實行後，上海黑市最近決不致波動。</p>

<p>東北以前只有兩個特別市，大連乃其一，街道之整潔，交通之暢達，水道之便利等等，無一不可與現代大都市匹敵。　大速之地勢乃為東北之唇，亦為東北之垣，野心侵略東北者，皆由此而人，近五十多年來約大連，一直沒有歸回祖國懷抱，地勢險要，由此可推知。　日寇自從俄國手中奪取大連以後、便視大連為本土，所有雷點要審·不停止的條茸着，島民積極遷殖，想盡了方法，開發與建設，因此逐漸的繁華起來，但是大速一切的一切，也完全操縱在日人手中。直到勝利了，日寇屈滕了，大連同胞們手斜足蹈的期待着政府早日慶收、而事實興望相達，盟邦捷足先登了，所謂解放，所謂拯救，不過如此如此，繼之匪軍又趁火打刦，狐假虎威，鬥爭淸算，五花八門，大連的同胞們，又墮入冰深火熱中了，現在只拼命的掙扎着，他們用最後的一口氣喘息着喊出來的就是：「親愛的祖國啊！快來拯救吧！拯救吧！」　大迎人口的數量，二年以前據敵之統計，有八十萬之多（包括日，韓，蘇），現在除去日僑回國，有志靑年及富有資產者流亡，與漢奸逃竄外，大運市只剩下十餘萬人口，加之膠東被鬥爭而逃來之同胞，共不足二十萬人、大連市區之廣大，人口稀少，凄慘冷靜狀態，不問可知。　經濟問題，現在大連最高當局「偽關東公署」，為要操縱经濟計，意故發行「關東公幣」，因我有旅大親察團之行，將此舉阻止了。因為時間之拖延，人民皆知，空氣每天緊張，通貨待時膨脹，後來無計可施、發出通告，謂係謠言，將此事終止，後來用一種極毒辣之手段，沒收民眾　資，所有人民私有錢款，强迫存入官家銀行，聲言貼印花票，一般人皆以為然，貼完即可發遺，當然更想不到沒收，但錢入虎口，皆束手無策，到期發表，按人數發還制，大人領三千，小孩領一千，其餘全禁支出，故經濟凍結，人已收苦連天。　常視察團將至大連時，六月一號，大速便開始刷洗街頭標語，更換警察服裝，訓練百姓及商店對答視察團的問詢，開始搬運各大工廠至金州，着手籌備視察團來後之對策，街頭崗位增添，大和旅館茶房換了特工，及視察團到達旅順，記者正在大連，據匪軍口中吐露，視察團在旅順不承認「關東公署」，而蘇聯又站在客觀立場，所又應聞者，應見者，皆不能從　，僅走馬看花的視察了一次。</p>
<p>現在的大連灣，往來的船隻，唯有紅星國徽的一種，所貿易的科目很簡單，一種是軍火，一種是食糧，裝去的是食糧，卸下來的是軍火。最近連市糧食發生荒缺，又派來一個叫列寗號的大船，三千餘噸，定期開往芝罘，每週往來一次，去的是軍火，回來的是小麥。最近有從烟台來的商人談稱，那邊糧價每天增漲，人民的生活，是在鞭撻之下掙扎的，唯一的盼望就是「接收」。　窮人翻身，我們可以顧名思義，方法倒令人噴飯，常去年的現在，一般窮人隨便在馬路上搶奪過往貨物，偷盜更為火熾，後來幾乎沒人敢在路上搬運貨物，窮的威力範圍越法廣大施展，實不像事體，才加以限制，現在總算不能明搶，只得暗偷。最慘者乃是日寇所遺留的官房與住宅，除了蘇軍與匪軍幹部佔用外，內部木料墻壁地板悉被拆毀。　匪軍在大連，凡事無有主權，與佳木斯，哈爾濱比，恐怖的狀態皆當剛。他們的工作人員、多半採用下級層，馬車夫，蹬三輪，賣冰菓者皆為特工。大連匪軍究全警察服裝（與潘陽警察服裝同），視察團到大連，蘇聯聲稱這是不受任何支配的中國民主聯軍，也是實行三民主義的，在視察團未去之先，匪幹部大批運往北鮮，專為第五次攻勢會議之用，轉下來的都在旅順金州一帶，大速市內很少。　蘇聯在大連，像戰勝國入戰敗國一樣，從六月一號蘇聯宣佈「免死刑」後，同時就發生醉人駕駛吉普車，撞死八個中國人，可是在報紙上看不見一點消息，無綫電上聽不見一句關於保障的話，民主乎！言論自由乎！大連山下的良好住宅，又及金州的很整齊的房子，都是高等　的當主人，工廠裏百分之九十九是空的。最奇的大邁人民尙有等級，一蘇，二匪，三日寇，四韓，五等才是中國老百姓，日寇多用女色吸引蘇軍滿意，換來地位，像從前一樣瞧不起中國人，更有很多與章狼狽爲奸的。</p>
<p>大連同胞的愛國心，是不可泯滅的，但精神與文化的食糧太缺乏了。</p>

<h3>立院訪問團在美考察　美朝野一致歡迎　定本月杪赴加拿大訪問</h3>
<p>〔本報駐紐約特約記者　　航訊」中國立法院訪問團此次來美，華僑暨美國官民均非常重視。訪問團於七月七日抵美京華盛頓後，九日訪衆院議長馬丁及衆院外交委員會委員長伊頓，相談巷治。（按馬丁爲總統候補人，伊頓爲共和黨議員，資望均高）十日訪國務院遠東司司長文生。十一日視察設備完美效率極高之聯邦偵查局（F.B.I.），十三日出席華僑歡迎會，十四日顧大使設鷄尾酒會於大使館，柬請美國參衆兩院若干議員，各國駐美大使，國務院各官員及教育。文化·金融界各領袖，與訪問團吳尙鷹·張肇元·盛振爲三氏相見，互談歷三小時。十五日復在顧大使晚宴中，與法前首相旭當及比·土·諸國駐美大使晤談，十六日訪問團視察國會圖書館，即全世界最完備之圖書館，並由國務院在招待國賓之勃萊亞大厦，設鷄尾酒會招待，參加者多兩院議員及中央行政官員，新任美國務院　東司司長白權華亦趕到參加。二十一日中午，奧尙屬·張　元·盛振爲及其隨從人員，由顧大使陪同謁見杜魯門總統，相談十五分鐘，並在白宮總統辦公案合攝一影。二十二日中午，衆院外交委員會委員長伊頓及議員富爾頓等，在衆院餐案設察招待訪問　。吳·張·盛三氏暨顧問秘書均參加，衆院共和黨議員參加者三十餘人，席間伊頓·富爾頓·及女護員波爾頓先後演說，表示歡迎，我國方面由顧大使，吳尙應秘書長及張肇元委員長致答詞，賓主均感愉快。廿三日復在參院與民主黨參議員數人聚餐，此時適値兩院日夜開會，加緊結束一切議案，俾於七月二十六日按期閉幕，故兩院議員撥冗相見，表示對於我國首次來美之立法人員，非常理視，且吳·張·盛三氏均出身於美國著名太學研究院，回國服務已歷二十五年至三十年之久，美國官民平有所知，故對三氏均甚恭敬·此外，吳·張·盛三氏或在參衆兩院列席旁聽，或至國會圖書館及中央印刷發行局研究法律，或與議員個人交換意見，三氏分工合作，吳尙　氏研對羣僑權益及改善待邁等問題，張肇元氏專心於商事法規及經濟協助中國各問題，而又鼓吹美國以白銀貸華，俾改良幣制，盛振爲注意於法律·敎育·及法院編制，均有相當收獲。例如，美·加兩國對於華僑待遇，最近已有不少修正，並允於不久將來陸續改善。自我國公司法第二九八條施行後，美國西部各州禁止華僑購置地產法律紛紛撤銷，所謂平等互惠原則，漸見實施，白銀貸華引起美國朝野深切注意，馬丁議長亦云値得深切考慮。此立法院訪問團在華　　盛頓之動態也。</p>
<p>七月廿七日，該團由華盛頓至紐的，張總領事及僑領多人在站歡迎。廿九日華僑開會歡迎，卅一日中美工商協會開圓桌會議，到該會會長董事二十餘人，其所提問題，多集中於我國公司法銀行法及現在貿易困難狀况，由我國公司法與銀行法起草人張肇元及吳尙鷹分別答覆，討論達三小時半，中美工商協會各領袖僉表滿意，並盼我國銀行法早日公布，保險法平日修正。八月四日訪問　至聯合國安全理事會列席旁聽，五日至著名新新監獄（Sing　Ding　Prison）考察，詳細研究各種設施，並在獄中午餐。六日張盛兩氏至少年法庭（專審十六歲以上十八歲以下男女　亭犯）觀審，此種法處不但爲各國所無，即在美亦僅有數處，其目的在使少年不與成年囚犯混合，以免深入歧途。八日，兩氏復參觀幼童法庭（專審理十六歲以下男女刑事犯）。旋又至家務法庭（專理夫婦瞻養爭持問題，其性質偏於偵查調解而不理離婚訟爭）。此皆爲我國尙未設立者，頗有借鐘之必要。紐約爲美國金融中心，該團各同人連日訪問考察，並與工商領袖交換意見，倍見忙碌，大約於八月二十日後前往加拿大首都，巳與加首相金氏約期相見，對於一般立法問題，交換意見。訪加後，在北美工作吿一段落，然後渡大西洋赴英倫。綜合該團在美工作，重在搜集資料，爲我國涉外立法爭取公平原則，解釋我國法律，使友邦明瞭，幷宣傳我國準備行憲實况。（八月十日自紐約寄）</p>
<h3>星期論壇　注意我國西南的門戶一康藏！</h3>
<p>— 洪石波</p>
<p>目下我國人士，無不注意中　北搭山事件的發展，而對於另一方面，我國西南的門戶，—康　，則甚祥注意。。但據康藏社昌都訊「康屬波密境內，發見英印武裝並不對，據謂係波寗土司將白馬崗等地「獻與英國」而特來與藏方交涉接受者。按波密，白馬崗均屬康境四部，比鄰前藏，南　印度接壤，為羌藏少數民族雜居之地。　第二次世界大戰結束後，中英俱列五強之一，但是就目前英國的舉動，真使人有點奇怪，她不是口口聲聲說，尊重我國領土主權的完整麼？西康是吾國的領土，何以英，印武裝部隊會　到波密和白馬崗的呢？雖然藉口波密土司向英國「獻地」，但波密土司是中國的士官，受中國政府的指揮，怎麼會向英國獻地呢？因為他沒有這樣的權力，即有其事，請問中國政府怎肯答應呢？如此她不是犯了離間我們民族的嫌疑麼？尤其奇怪的，竟向藏方交涉據收該地！西藏在我國行政上是一地方，雖有　　達賴二喇嘛主持，　在我　藏委員會管制之下；假使英人舉真要「接收」，應逕向我政府交涉才對，如何可向藏方交涉呢？</p>
<p>據波密和白馬崗的地位，在一般較詳的地圖裏嗎，都有出在，其區戰在北緯廿九　卅一度，東經九十四度半至九十七度間，於碩　，達恩，八宿，昌都的南面，處康寄送的西南，密　印度的阿薩密省，於印度第一大河恒河R.of　Brahmapuua）的另一主流雅魯藏布江的大灣曲處，下流入印，名布拉馬普特拉河（R.of　Brahmapuua），於加爾各答（Calcutta）之東北，與恒河正流會合，注入孟加拉灣（B.of　Bengal）故波，白二地實處恒河的上游；上衛拉薩，下指加域，內拱康滇，外禦印緬，形勢衝要。人民多西藏族的康巴和藏巴人（Chang-pa　＆　Khang-pa），使用藏語系的喀木語，北阿薩密語，或其固有方言。人民知識落後，敎育幷不發達，境內尙存有土司制，權限頗大。間亦有少數英國敎士，自印入藏，至該地傳敎。地境適處於康滇峽谷區，和西藏高原間，有高山如伯舒拉嶺，安日里山，喜馬拉雅山等。與雅魯藏布江轉角處，稍有小小的峽谷盆地，逐漸向南開展，可種植小麥，或青稞。人民生活，大體與西藏相同。境內高山大河阻隔，交通頗不便。（此則就對我中央管理言，但如由印度加城至寒的亞（Sadiya）鐵路北上，即能直達我邊境；或自亞東入藏轉康，則稍遠，主客勞逸之勢判然。以故英人挾其地勢之利，侵我邊陲，早在理想中）。境內物產不很豐富，高山地帶森林茂盛，多未開採，家畜亦多，鑛產則尙未有確實統計。　英人自佔領印度後，倂錫金，（哲孟雄），藩不丹，與尼泊爾，我西南藩籬盡撤，更遵而思染指吾康藏。民初曾利用達賴親英，背叛吾國，後幾經交涉，方承認我操繼續的宗主權。民國六年，西藏喇嘛受愚，媾兵內犯，佔據康西十餘縣，後由英人出國調停，以康東十六縣歸政府軍治理，昌都以西，暫由藏軍佔領。民國十六年，中央改川邊特別區爲西康省，亟謀治邊之策，但省政府迄未設立。民廿七，政府因中日事變內遷，即劃川西雅安·西昌·等十五縣入康，方設省政府於康定，粗具規模。但其西方與前藏毗連，省界迄未劃分淸楚。普通地圖，均以唐古刺山口迄無定山族一綫爲主，但與外國出版的地圖不同。外國地圖把西藏的東界延長到察隅附近，包括波密和自馬崗等土司在內；所以外國人看來，就把該地當作西藏境內。目今康東雖有省政府，似漢夷雜處，治理困難，去年天全，雅安·榮經等縣，曾發生剿烟之戰，目今雖已敉平，但隱憂未可忽視。康西政治，形如西藏，藏邊有急，每有累及康邊之虞。且土　　司昏庸，智識州淺陋，輙易受人愚弄及利用。政府因鞭畏莫及，雖明有所聞，惟有坐視其發展，致使外患迭興。至於康南沿印度一帶，更爲英人所垂涎，因該處地勢適當印度恒河大平原之北鄙，與西藏比較，更爲近便，且無高山之阻隔，（藏印有喜馬拉雅山天險爲界）自加爾各答到塞的亞的鎭路造成後，染指更易，可見其覬覦我邊陲，早已處心積慮。英國著名地與社George　Philip　＆Son，LTD.於一九三六年出版之地圖，已將該地劃入印邊，（西起不丹，東迄恩梅開江，（R.orNmai-kha）上流寬約五十到七十英里之沿邊地帶）計劃設立一東北邊省（North-East　Frontier　Province）（此就作者所見或許早先的地圖已經如此了），則至一九四七年止，已十年於斯（可能更早），我人固漠然未之知也。</p>
<p>今年三四月內，西藏曾發生一次內亂。原來西藏的政權本操於僧人和貴族的手中，僧人多親漢，俗人則親英。當活佛達賴十三世圓寂後，親漢派領袖然振爲色拉寺之主持人，曾被選爲攝政王，但上台後，與親英派不睦，因此變方寃仇甚深。後親英派得勢，熱振反被擠下。迨民卅二，熱振與西康省生席劉文輝合作，並發動色拉。葛登·別蚌·三大寺之變，但結果難挽頹勢。最近西藏攝政王達扎因年老即將辭職，熟振頗有東山再起之勢，親英派先下手將熱振逮捕，判以叛亂的罪名，尤其拉魯色有殺父之仇，梁爲嫉忌，三月中即施報復手段，剜去熱振之目，四乃中荀竟加以秘密處死。三大寺不服，羣起反抗，遂有此次內亂。目今雖吿平息，但隨時仍有復發之可能。據息，拉魯色等所以敢如此者，其後因有某種背景關係。親英派雖如此，但仍恐劉文輝率部入藏，故藏軍已在康藏邊境及怒江附近建築工事，積極增防，可見其對中央的戒懼。</p>
<p>我國邊界　連最長者，捨蘇聯外，即爲印織。但吾國於西南邊陲，向用　　政策，不思實邊圖防。現在雖較過去情形略好，但因民族不同，土地荒僻，交通阻隔，氣候不適，及邊疆政策的不積極，邊務大臣的無能爲，幷格於其他種種環境，迄未有妥善的辦法。如將來力量允許，當先設自成都經康定。巴安·昌都·碩督·太昭·到拉薩或日喀則的川藏鐵路，與成渝鐵路接軌，不僅西南的土產如　毛·羚羊角·麝香·鹿茸·犀角·沙金·石油·可和長江流城的物產互換，在治政軍事上的意義尤其重要，因此橫貫鐵路完成後，康藏可直接依附於中央，指揮較便，於次要的地方敷設公路。然後灌輸敎育，使民智開通，改良土地，使生產增加，融和民族，使隔膜淸除，積極建設，使事羣進步。當然還有其他的許多條件，廢除目今的土地制，改劃縣治，設省政府，究全和內地的行政制度一樣，使直接受中央　治。行取的効果，必較現在便利得多。</p>
<p>波密事件旣已發展到如此地步，希望我國政府不僅應向英國提出强硬抗議，速命其部隊退出我國國界以外，同時固我疆　，給以武力的還擊。此外，在必要時還可以搜集證據，向聯合國安全理事會申訴，以期得到公正的判斷。</p>

<h3>「上帝造人·我造城市」　國際市政聯會紀要</h3>
<p>—孔秋泉寄自巴黎—</p>
<p>顧巴博氏有言：「上帝造人，人造城市。」數千年來城市素爲文明歷史的源泉，而莊資本主義經濟體系下，城市尤爲經濟·政治·人才·技術最集中的所在。然而經過戰爭殘酷的破壞，城市的心靈與嶇壳，顯然都已日趨凋落了。爲了從事復興與重建，國際市政聯合國最近又召開第七屆年會於法京巴黎。</p>
<p>此次到會的國家，除我國外，尙有美·法·英·荷·加·南非·阿根廷·奧·比·保加利亞·古巴·厄瓜多。義大利。荷蘭。匃牙利，盧森堡。挪威·秘書。波蘭·羅馬尼亞·　羅·瑞士·捷克·法屬突尼斯·土耳其等共計廿六國，每國出席人數不等，有多至數十人者。如英法兩國，因該兩國重要城市皆有代表參加。我國方面聞亦推定中國市政協會常務理事兼上海分會正副理事長奚玉書，黃伯樵，暨駐法大使錢泰氏三人爲代表，但因奚黃兩氏不克趕來，而錢大使亦因奉命參加同時在巴黎開會之國際糧食會議，故結果請由江錫　氏代表參加。該會係於我國抗戰紀念（七月七日）開幕，十二日閉會，一週中討論頗爲熱烈，茲誌其情形如下：</p>
<p>議事日程及討論情形</p>
<p>按照國際市政聯合會原定議事日程，計應分組委員會討論：（一）地方自治；（二）民衆敎育（三）市區復興；（四）國際市政聯合會機構之擴大等四題。嗣以分組討論發生困難，決定改由全體討論。八月九日十一日係由出席代表就地方自治，民衆敎育，市區復興三問題報告各該城現狀，十二日上午則係根據前三日之討論，作一綜合性之結論。（一）「地方自治」大多數國家內地方政府現有之目由，因受戰時中央政府統制影響，較戰前爲小，又因地方財政困難，須要中央政府接濟之處甚多，致地方政府之自由益受束縛，最佳辦法，應由中央政府根據各地財政需要，發給津貼，後即由地方政府自行處理。（二）「民衆敎育」應由地方政府負責，但不應有政治意味，而市區住屋之建築與子女敎育亦有關係，如住屋之建築可使母親無須全付精神用於操勞管理，則大部時間可注意子女敎育。（三）「市區復興」希望參加國際市政聯合會之國家能將1因戰事及被敵人所毀壞之建築其估計及資料，2有關地方復興之法令及土地立法；3地方復興之預算資料，送交市政聯合會，並望各國市政組織對於國際市政聯合會之建議，予以特別注意。十二日下午則討論國際市政聯合會機構之擴大，及下次會議日期及地點等問題。</p>
<p>下屆會議日期及地點</p>
<p>國際市政聯會機構之擴大及下次會議之日期地點及議程。</p>
<p>（甲）「常設局之設立」決定設立常設局，每會員國應派代表二人至三人參加，每一代表每年應出會費爲一千二百瑞士佛郞（約合三百美金）。第一次常設局全體會議在本年九月至十月期間舉行，應由各國儘速將加入聯合會之各市政團體名稱及參加常設局之代表姓名，通知聯合會，（參加常設局之代表人數係以國爲單位）。此事仍由參加本屆會議之團體負責進行。（乙）下屆會議（一）一九四八及一九四九年均有會議，但何年爲大會，何年爲常會，由常設局決定之。</p>
<p>（三）曾議地點有捷克日內瓦及加拿大三項提議，一九四八年一九四九年兩次會議地點由常設局決定之。（三）下次會議議事日程應有，一，地方財政；二，地方經濟活動範圍；三，修改聯合會各項章程等三項。</p>
<p>該次大會主席及秘書長係由國際市政聯合會會長哈立斯及秘書長溫奈克分任，戰後我國都市所受之損害狀况及一般之建設計劃，亦經提會議吿，頗獲得各國代表之珍視，大會會長哈立斯氏晤本會代表時盛讚大上海計劃之遠大理想云。</p>

<h3>中央氣象局長　呂炯定期赴美　對技術人員　有才難之嘆</h3>
<p>中央氣象局局長呂炯，日前由京來滬，定二十日出國赴華盛頓，出席國際氣象會議。呂氏爲我國著名之氣象學專家，除任職氣象局外，並執敎於中央浙江兩大學，去年呂氏曾奉命出國，參加戰後首屆國際氣象會議，並膺選爲國際氣象組織七執行委員之一，又兼任該組織之海洋氣象專門委員會委員，此次赴美係以我國之苜席全權代表身份出席。</p>
<p>直轄氣象臺　共八十九所</p>
<p>記者昨走訪呂局長，詢及國內之一般氣象合現狀。據稱：全國直屬中央氣象局管轄之業象台，共有八十九所，分佈於全國各大城市。此外，各省市亦有氣象台之設立，經費由各省市個別負担，所用人員則由氣象局統轄。前氣象局所感覺困難者，厥惟經費之拮据，與技術人員之缺乏，前項困難，有美國儀器之大批轍送來華，近已稍感解決，後者則非短時間所可謀解決者，因全國各大學理學院，設有氣象系者，僅中央大學與淸華大學，然每年畢業之人數寥寥無幾，如今年氣效局及空軍司令部氣象處，共需技術人員二百餘名，而畢業者僅中大有二人，試問如何支配？中央雖有氣象訓練班之設立，然畢業者僅能担任普通之技術工作，故氣象局雖有力圖擴展之決心，然以人才之無法羅致，終未能如願，呂局長深望全國各大學能多添設氣旬系，並希望靑年學子研讀此趣味濃厚之氣象學，爲今後中國之氣象界開創新的道路。</p>

<h3>火車飛賊　黨魁落網　受不住疲勞審問　領捉得同黨三名</h3>
<p>近兩路沿綫跳車盜竊案迭有發生，路局警務處異常重視。本月十五日，王處長令刑警隊偵探長康一民，探警長張英俊，探警劉作民，赴無錫密查。十六日晨二時卅分，康偵探長在錫站月台見一藍布短衫靑年，形跡可疑。適由京駛滬第九次特快車抵錫，該靑年上車，康即與張探警長尾隨監視。</p>
<p>失風被擒　跳車逃逸</p>
<p>迨車出錫站，旅客均熟睡時，該靑年忽起立，先吸紙烟，然後離座摸索行李架上，竊得內存法幣一百六十五萬元及書籍衣服之網綫袋一隻，（係來滬投考交大之楊統元者所有），得手後，大步走出車廂，態度極大方。至此匿於暗處之康偵探長及張探警長即踉踪追出，時該犯已抵八二〇號及九四二號二車廂交節處，爲張警長抱住。不意該犯向張左臂猛咬一口，張痛極踣地，一剎那間，該犯業已蹤身翻至車頂上，在　亭站附近，携帶原臟於客車疾行如飛之際，自車廂跳下，逃逸無踪</p>
<p>謊報遭刦　自投羅網</p>
<p>康偵探長於車抵蘇州站時，急電望亭警務所詳述該犯形容及跳車地點，請派警協助追緝。該所得報後，正擬派員追緝，不意忽有一衣藍布短衫血流滿臉之靑年，前往報失，謂渠在九次車上遭刦，並爲匪徒從車上推下。警務所以該靑年所着衣服與康偵探長所吿者相同，隊虛與蛇委外，一面即密電在蘇之康探長，請其從速赴望亭。康據報率張警長趁車前往，經密認之下，果係跳車之逃犯，當即將其扣押，</p>
<p>疲勞審同　招出同黨</p>
<p>該犯旣經捕獲，以其面部受傷，當押解赴錫醫治，待包紮後，隨即押回錫滬警務段第一分段，由分段長閔建被選用疲勞審問方法審問，該犯遂招供，名張炳仁，廿六歲，山東濟南人，係著名之「蚌埠帮飛車黨」主犯。共有黨羽八人，後以蚌埠一帶已無當有旅客往返，於去歲年底南下，盤踞蘇錫一帶，專在夜快車上行竊，犯案已達數百次之多。後又押解該犯至站，當塲經其指出同黨袁良効（廿七歲廣東人），黃英（廿三歲廣東人），及王某華（廿五歲桂林人），拘捕歸段，均直認結夥飛車行竊不諱。至尙有同黨三名，則已聞風潛逃。獲犯交康偵探長押解，於昨午由錫抵滬。逃犯則</p>
<p>當衆表演　跳車絕技</p>
<p>四犯抵滬後，警務處令主犯張炳仁當衆表汪跳車絕技，幷授予包袱及箱篋各一。該犯即將箱　袱於背上，登車時身輕如燕，迨登車後，則身手捷如猿猴。當從車廂中翻身上車頂及從車頂上縱身跳下時，週身竟安然無恙。跳爬技術極熟。該犯等俟再度審訊後，即將解送法院嚴辦云。</p>

<h3>江灣體育塲　參觀新兵營　穿着草綠色軍便服活潑矯健　知識水準營齊缺乏精神食糧</h3>
<p>使得民主自由的新中國在世界的頂點屹立，和奠定生存自由的國防，及防禦未艾的外侮，肅淸內亂，必先建立堅强的軍備，凡是有志氣，有熱血的靑年，都應該慷慨踴躍地應徵服役，克盡國民的義務，那麼「好男兒該當兵」！</p>
<p>江灣路上的一個角落裏，方圓百畝的運動塲中，正活躍數千名翻山越嶺，長途跋涉來自遠方的壯士們——新兵羣，在他們健康而堅强的體魄上，我們可以認識了中國的民族魂，是善良的，健壯的，不屈的，不撓的新生命。</p>
<p>冒署慰勞新兵</p>
<p>當記者到了江灣體育塲，看到成羣地新兵們，穿着整齊的，草綠色軍便服，顯得是那麼奕奕有神，嚴肅地在等待帶隊的官長的命令，佈置他們的新旅舍，或安詳地踞坐着靜等醫師們來給他們注射防疫針，是那樣地自然，是那樣地欣悅。　一輛一輛的汽車到達，黨部的方主委，參議會的潘議長，謝書記長仁釗，他們爲了勘察塲地和慰勞新兵，當着烈日酷暑，親自出馬佈低。</p>
<p>港口司令施兆衡將軍，以沉着的口吻吿訴記者們過境新兵的人數暨分佈的情形，他說：「過去自先分佈在龍華·南市·吳淞等十二處，本來因爲馬上要海運到東北去集中訓練，所以沒有統一的計劃，但現在因船艦運輸工具不敷分配，爲了便於管理，決定利用這廢墟，加以整理作爲南上北下的新兵兄弟們休憇的營址，同時蔣主席對新兵的膳宿問題，極爲關注，上次曾命徐思平局長，來滬曉論種切，刻已由聯動部運來篷帳五百頂，行軍牀萬張，預計日內此地可以容納全部在滬過境新兵」。</p>
<p>帶給溫情慰藉</p>
<p>因爲新兵們在沿途和活沒有正常規則，所以腸胃炎最爲普遍，其次痢疾，瘧疾，及感冒等流行病症，恐怕有傳染病，故大部份入營新兵都經過注射防疫及霍亂的藥水·最令人入勝的是紅號衣的淸潔夫，白色服裝的看護小姐，配以綠色軍服的新兵，成了紅白相間，一輻巨匠的名作　爲了使病兵能够得到安靜的休養機會，刻將利用過去的游泳池闢爲療養室，及隔籬病房，現正加强在環境的衛生及防疫二部工作。</p>
<p>刻下的飲水問題，業已達到改善的地步，自來水管接通後，將開放淋浴室及洗衣槽，電綫即將裝置竣工，不久將在這地方帶來都市的光和熱。</p>
<p>潘議長在暴烈的炎陽下，去參觀每一個篷帳和新兵們住的地方，正好逢着他們就地圖　吃飯，菜以豬肉，洋葱，辣椒，蔬焚爲主，方主羣會就大　旁咀　一份飯及菜，同時因爲他是安徽人，又特地跑去皖中大隊一訪同鄕們，大談同鄕的關係，每個新兵感到　樣的親切。聞慰勞　方面，爲了使新兵們能得到同鄕的溫暖與慰情，故而發動各個同鄕會發動慰勞大會，現已有湖南，安徽，浙江，廣西，發起響應。</p>
<p>盼閱報紙雜誌</p>
<p>記得以閃電的姿態，在新兵中拉出一位年方十九歲的矮小身村叫姚勵志的大孩子，問他是否强逼應徵的呢？還是別的緣因參加的？他張開了大眼睛，自然地露着一口潔白的牙齒，哭着操了一腔湖南的土語，答覆得很正確，很幽默，「我已經不小了，自然可以應徵當兵，我不能自願替國家出力嗎？」記者爲他一股正義的情緒所感動，幾乎落下淚來，情不自禁伸出手和他緊緊地握了一握手</p>
<p>據一位帶隊的官你說：一在新兵中智識水準都相當整齊，所感缺少的是精神食糧，希望能够看到當地的報紙和雜誌」。關於這些，聞慰委會，慰勞組已有整個軍中文化的計劃，方主委談云：「日內在空塲左右將裝置擴音機及無綫電的設備，轉播慰勞節目，並利用原有的體育塲中的電影塲，每日由本市戲劇公會流演出話劇。平劇·維揚戲·粵劇越劇等節目」。</p>
<p>在暮色蒼茫中，在新兵弟兄雄壯歌聲的熱流中，在激昂溫情的情緒交流中，離開了新兵們的旅程中的「綠洲」。（李子戈）</p>
<h3>工程專家以昇博士　播講黃浦越江工程　越江工程是繁榮浦東的生命綫　市民應團結力量完成偉大建設</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報昨日假座金都電台，舉辦第二十次星期日特別廣播，請工程專家茅以昇博士播講：「黃浦越江工程」，茲紀錄其演詞大意如下：</p>
<p>上海的發展是從黃浦江的東岸（即外難）起始，逐漸向西推廣，長達十餘公里，一面從地面向上空發展，形成外灘一帶的高樓大厦。但黃浦江的東岸，與外灘相距不過五百公尺，這一片浦東的大區域，却毫無動靜，依然保持着百年前的狀態，一水之隔，相差懸殊，是何道理呢？這理由，很顯明的，是爲了租界的關係。黃浦以西有租界，故繁榮，黃浦以東無租界，故衰落，這實是一件慘痛的史實。在國際各大都市表面，雖是占了第六位，却不免减少了許多光彩。</p>
<p>隧道最合理　經費異常浩大</p>
<p>幸而勝利後的上海市政當局，在接收上海後，立刻便想到開發浦東這件事，而有上海市越江工程委員會的組織，來研究推動這越江工程的計畫。現在就將這研究的結果，簡單的作一報吿。</p>
<p>越江工程這名詞，是從越江工程委員會起始的，就是穿過黃浦江的工程。這工程如在空中的，便是橋梁，如在水面的，便是用船拚起的浮橋，如在水下地裏的，便是隧道，在工程技術上都是辦得到的事。有了這越江工程，使浦東逐漸的和浦西一樣的繁榮起來，這越江工程不就是浦東的生命綫，和黃浦江是上海的生命綫一樣嗎。</p>
<p>可惜的是這兩個生命綫，彼此有點衝突，這越江工程要穿過黃浦江，而黃浦江上，大小輪船，日夜川流不息，倘若這越江工程防碍了黃浦江的水上交通，那便成了浦東還未受益，而上海先受其害了！因此這越江工程的計畫，要以維持黃浦的水上交通爲先決條件，而水面上用船拚接的浮橋，便不値一顧。這裏便要研究隧道和橋梁的利害。隧道是最理想的越江工程，但工程費異常浩大，照今天的物價，建造雙車道的隧道，坡度百分之四，恐怕需費五千億元之鉅。</p>
<p>高橋不易實現　低橋辦法折衷</p>
<p>請到橋梁，有高橋和低橋之分。高橋是要使最大的輪船能在橋下通過，那就是水面上要留一百尺以上的凈空，這橋梁本身的建築費固然可觀，而尤其困難的，是這樣高的橋，從地面走上去，需要極長的橋堍，假定這高橋是從中正路外灘過江，那麼這橋　的起點，便幾乎要延長到大世界，一切車輛才能安全上橋，這樣長的橋堍，不但建築費很大，影響兩旁地產，而且從外灘過江，還要退回到大世界，才能上橋，豈非糟塌時間嗎？因此黃浦江上的高橋，也不易實現。至於低橋，那是一個折衷的辦法，遇到大輪船過橋時，道橋中的一段，可以開啓，從平放的地位，變成豎立，讓出一段水路，使輪船通過。這活動橋的開放和關閉，每次祇需時一分半鐘，對於橋上車輛的交通，當然不便，但無須很畏的橋堍，因之建築費比高橋省得多，比隧道也便宜，拿同一時期的物價來比較，，祗占隧道建　費的四分之一。</p>
<p>經費如何籌措</p>
<p>發生幾個疑問</p>
<p>以上所講的隧道，高橋，和低橋，三種越江工程，在技術上雖各有困難，都是辦得到的事。在經濟上，如何籌措呢？從通過費和土地受益費的兩種來源，籌募工程經費，應當是有辦法的，但這裏有幾個前提：（一）現在橫越浦江的交通有輛渡，等到幾時，輪渡才顯得吃力，不足應付渡江的需要，而促成越江工程的實現。（二）現在浦東還未開發，其最大的原因，是國內經濟失調，何年何月，大家才來到浦東建築呢？浦東不開發，過江的運輸，還能增加嗎？（三）在現代都市，橋梁和隧道的建築，都是生產事業，從不仰賴政府補助，但如上海舉辦這越江工程，而發行公債，上海市民對他的信用如何，能同其他國際都市相比嗎？有多少人願意投資到這種債券，而不去買黃金美鈔呢？（四）越江工程是大上海都市計畫的一部門，要想求越江工程的實現，必須其他聯帶的計畫也能進行到同一程度，方能彼此配合，否則縱然有了越江工程，而浦東並未能同時開發，這工程豈非賠本生意呢？</p>
<p>如果計書實現　每一市民之光</p>
<p>照這樣看來，好像黃浦越江工程，目前是無多希望的了。但上還有五百多萬的市民，是世界上六大都市之一，在一切大上海的都市計畫中，這越江工程最偉大最艱鉅的建設，倘若上海市民，能團結力量，來担負這一偉大建設，從最難的做起，作爲全國都市建設的模範，有一天上海的市民，能安閒的步行通過黃浦江，那上海過去的歷史，便成每一市民的光榮！</p>
<h3>特別廣播節目</h3>

<h3>蠻天夷雲　壯士歷險　美調查深入山谷　搜尋失事忠骨殘機</h3>
<p>〔本報記者周學端成都十二日訊〕猶憶抗戰最艱險階段，一椿偉大的奇蹟—即中美合作，飛越駝峯—會創造了當時中國新的輸血管，奠定最後勝利基礎。爲了飛越駝峯，多少忠魂，葬身於異城亂山萬峯。勝利以後，美政府也曾多次派隊偵察搜尋異城忠骨，每次深入夷區，極富探險意味，這是記者從最近一次隨美軍涉險歸來的一位壯士，訪問得來的一段探險史。</p>
<p>亂山業中</p>
<p>英雄理骨所在</p>
<p>飛越駝峯，在一九四四年，爲了完成這偉大壯舉，多少忠骸碎身在印度，喜馬拉亞山與川康藏諸地的亂山叢中。勝利後，美政府數度派隊入山，搜尋忠骨機骸，但毫無結果。本年五月，美國軍事當局經長時間研究，判斷可能有九架飛機，失事於川康境內，並就當時飛行路綫經過地區考證，派遣韓格蘭中尉率隊來川調查。五月下旬，韓中尉抵蓉請川省政當局協助，由川康綏署派翻譯副官李昌杰協同前往，取道西康轉赴懋功搜尋。</p>
<p>深山遇險</p>
<p>遭受匪徒截擊</p>
<p>六月初旬，這一隊調查隊開始艱險旅程，翻山越嶺，步步深入夷區。在川康邊境一帶，全是漢夷雜居的「不毛之地」，高山嵯峨，亂流縱橫，懸崖萬丈，峭壁千　，人種大部是半開化的玀夷，羌番。摩些，和少數強頑的漢人。這是川康的「化外之邦」，同時也是少數冒險家的樂園—販烟與種烟者的禁地。在深山窮谷，或草原曠野，常常有萑符潛伏，盜匪出沒。他們在這些高山峻嶺，深林邃谷之中，窮搜了一個多月，歷盡艱苦。七月十九日，抵達康省甘巴與康定間的大砲山叢林中，突來大批槍械單利的股匪截擊，當塲展開激烈遭遇戰。但因匪徒人多槍利，衆寡不敵，李副官身受重傷，隨行保護之西康保安隊被擊斃五名，美調查隊幸無死傷，當即率部退下半山，困守石壁，卒賴援軍到來，始將匪徒擊退。</p>
<p>高原草地</p>
<p>完成初步任務七月下旬，調查隊進入飛機失事的可能地帶，這是四川的西南西北邊區，屬於高原草地，為藏番及玀夷遊牧活動之所。金沙江及鴉龍，安寗，會通三河自北南流，形成縱深峽谷，拔海在三千尺左右，四週環繞着大小雪山，大小凉山，大小相嶺諸高央。草地中間的高原，氣候寒冷，野草千里，居民三分之二爲　夷，性格殘暴，習俗兇頑，殺人越貨，視爲家常，是有名的「夷匪」。調查隊抵達其間，因爲該地峻嶺羅列，且爲航道必經之地，於是步步爲營，嚴密偵察，在高峯入習，懸崖壁立，無路可通的險峻地方，則槌繩而下，深入探測，經歷千辛萬苦，卒於七月廿七日在懋功達維鄕木耳寨山腰，查獲一九四四年七月七日夜間，由印飛川之B29運輪機一架，在該處碰山失事的殘骸，機中死難英雄早已安葬。韓中尉在任務初步完成之後，已電告美政府，現再作繼續的進一步搜索工作。在記者聽完這勇敢受傷英雄的一段冒險故事之後，深深對現代肚會中的古中世紀冒險偉績，引起無限崇敬，瞻望蠻天夷　，遙祝他們成功歸來。</p>
<h3>河嶽英靈！　滁縣各界　追悼孟良崮　陣亡將士</h3>
<p>〔本報特約記者丁匡華南京十五日訊〕「八一三」是一個最沉痛的紀念日，七四師選定這一天來追悼孟良崗剿匪陣亡將士，痛定思痛，這意義何等沉重深切！這一天，　縣城裏充滿著悽慘，全市齋戒，如喪考妣，血淋淋的半良旗，更替忠勇烈士們灑下無限的熱淚！　蔣主席代表楊高參來了，王耀武司令官代表鄭副統監來了，湯副總司令恩伯代表劉參謀長來了，這些長官當他聽到他的部下在孟良崗壯烈成仁的吼聲，莫不為之寢食俱廢，尤其是張靈甫這位虎將，今天他們實在忍不住親來參加。然而那顆心，那點淚，我們可以想到更會比親自走到陣亡將士的靈前，一定還要難過，還要悲傷。</p>
<p>滁縣中學校臨時作了追悼大會的會塲，佈置雍肅，倍覺哀思。</p>
<p>千餘輻幅聯</p>
<p>不約而同的　爲今日之「張睢陽」，「岳武穆」，這實在不是偶然的。蔣主席親輓「河嶽英靈」，「浩然正氣」，于院長親輓「大知大仁大勇」，陳立夫親輓「碧血丹心」，都爲孟良崗陣亡將士揚眉吐氣。</p>
<p>在沉痛氣氛中，楊高參代表蔣主席宜讀他對七十四師忠勇將士宣慰的文吿。接着就是鄭副總監代表王耀武司令官訓示，由於王司令官與七十四師關係特殊，所以他的情感，他的悲哀，更較任何人深切。地說：「整七十四師是我一個最親切最熟悉的部隊，我曾經像嬰孩一樣的哺養過他、敎育過他，培植過他，近年來他雖然離開了我，但是他的成長，他的發展他的戰績，仍然是我所最關心的，也是我是樂於聽到的事。</p>
<p>在一個難得的機會裏，記者又訪問張夫人</p>
<p>王玉玲女士</p>
<p>。這時，她的眼淚仍是涔涔地流下，記者乘機安慰了一番，過了一會，她沉痛的對記者說：「他死了，爲國犧牲，這是無上的光榮，可是留給我的，是未滿半歲的紹靈，和一個難堪的回憶」。眼淚又涔涔流下了，過了不久，慢慢的她又繼續的對記者說：「靈甫是對得起國家，國家也對得起靈甫念他這種犧牲在我個人是不幸的，但對國家對民族，是偉大的，一個半月以來，我始終是在哀思着，忽然有一天在報上看到蔣主席賜命「靈甫號」艦名的消息，我心中何等高興，死的靈甫活像在我身邊一樣，他不偸生，所以有這樣死得重如泰山，他的太太，他的兒子，乃至他的朋友同學，自然引爲無上的光榮。接着她又說道：　靈甫不辜負國家，我絕對不辜負靈甫，我是有我進取的勇氣的，我撫育着紹靈，更當振奮着我自己，我當再深切砥勵着，因爲我還祗受了中等敎育如果使我不辜負靈甫，那我還當繼續我的學業，繼承靈甫的遺志替國家盡一番義務，同時更可慰靈甫在天之靈，紹靈是一個可愛的兒子，也很像他的爸爸，我希望能盡我的力量造就他成材。我雖不敢比擬孟母，但我希望紹靈成爲一個孟子，」張夫人是一個多麼有作爲的女子，記者內心裏深深地讚美她，最後她吿訴記者：「張師長是一個典型的軍人，我了解他最淸楚，我想將練習我的寫作，替他寫一部小說，來紀念他！」他很高興的說：這個責任太大了，以後還得請你們與論界多多協助啊！</p>

<h3>一波三折·險些兒流產　鄭州農械公司宣告成立</h3>
<p>〔本報記者范世勤鄭州十一日訊〕聯總行總熱望促成之鄭州農業機械公司，已於十一日在此成立。可是臨盆之際，發生了種種彼折，險些兒成了流產。該公司資本原定二十億元實收四行投資十億，豫省行二億，十三縣公地折價投資一億五千萬，開封遠東企業公司一億，地方人士一億餘，新鄕帮人士六億三千萬。於成立會時，新鄕帮人士突然宣吿退出，據說：該帮人十事前提出了一張董監事及經理等名單，未被大眾接受，故憤而出此。該公司的性質，是以民營爲原則，所以對於各銀行的投資所引起的股權問題，也起了很大爭執：在銀行方面認爲銀行之投資，是協助性質，將來地方人士增加股份，銀行方面可以隨時退出，但目前股權方面的限止應該有個分寸；但一般地方人士主張，每一銀行之股權應納於其一個單位之內，同時股權匯百十一股起至一百每股以八折計，一百零一股起至三百股以七折計，二百零一股起至三百股以六折計，結果前者依銀行方面的主張，後者依地方人士的主張。另一波折，其中所選出之董事劉春農，在成立會前繳款，但款還沒轉入帳上</p>

<h3>水災區的英雄　集體搶救水中食糧</h3>
<p>〔本報記者縱春林徐州十四日訊〕蘇北今夏水災慘重，爲七十年來所未有。邳·蕭·銅·錫·豐·各縣災情尤爲慘重。全境陸沈，秋禾盡入水底，災民無衣無食，亟待振濟。蘇建設廳長黃贊堯上週三赴邳縣勘災，車抵八叉集，只見水天一色，農民辛苦了一年，對莊稼的一切希望，全被水淹沒了，高梁穗還在水面上低著頭掙扎，黃豆，棉花等低桿植物，很少露出水面。越向東走，水災越重，因爲徐海公路的阻隔，洪水萵速度朝南捲去，公路陸沈，趙　是水災最嚴重的地區之一。前些時，水未退落時，鐵路皆入水底，成千成萬從水鄕逃出的難民、臉上刻劃着愁苦，額角記錄着受難的痕跡，年老的人淚澘潸不止，刧災的人慼到無法忍受的哀傷！</p>
<p>撑船到大楡樹，在一片汪洋中，眺望海沒了的田禾，和半淹半浮的村莊，像舟字在大海中張望小鳥一樣。大楡樹在二百年前，只一棵樹，兩人家，慢慢繁衍，迄今才成了數百戶人口的大鎭。可是大褕樹在抗戰期問，被人出賣，當柴燒了。還有戰前培植無數人材的運河鄕村師範，現在屋子全在水中，校舍也毀滅完了。</p>
<p>一羣難民，他們集體搶救水中的食糧，緊緊的國結在一起，有糧食大家吃，其中一個中年人，用一大塊門板，推着一袋濕糧食，在水上漂浮，他自己泅着水，掀動門板，走了十五里，我們敬佩這位災區英雄</p>
<p>太陽快落山了，難民的炭棒般的黑手，摔看高粱　子，狼吞虎嚥地吃着。據王縣長天中說，水位雖已落三尺，依舊水天一色，災象不减，不用說明年春天，一個半月以後，飢餓的恐怖將威脅整個的邳縣和蘇北三百多萬災民。</p>

<h3>俞財長張總裁　發表書面談話　日常必需品價格不致變動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財政部兪部長及中央銀行張總裁，爲改訂外匯管理及進出口貿易辦法，發表書面談話，茲分誌如下：</p>
<p>俞氏談話</p>
<p>政府於去年十一月公佈管理進出口貿易辦法以來，進出口貿易，已較前略有改善。惟以官價匯率，與市價相差日鉅，出口仍感困難，僑匯逃避，及貨物走私亦日形猖獗，對於國際收支，及國民經濟，影響至鉅，亟應予以補救。所有補救辦法，經政府詳爲研究，殺近國務會議，業已通過修正中央銀行管理外匯暫行辦法，及進出口貿易辦法，付諸實行。該辦法對於民生必需物品，如棉花，米，麥，麵粉，肥料，及煤炭等，仍由中央銀行繼續按現行官價匯率，供給外匯。其他進口物品所需外匯，暨各項正當外匯需要，概由中央銀行及指定銀行，運用出口外匯，及華僑匯款等項支付，均按市價計算。政府更爲調怖外匯供需平衡匯價起見，特設置外匯平衡基金委員會，以司其責。深信此項辦法實施以後，日常生活必需物品之價格，不致有何變動。而出口貨物及華僑匯款情况，可較前改善。對於國際收支，及國民經濟，裨益匪淺。亟盼全國人民，共體時艱，熱忱協助政府，以達成任務。</p>
<p>張氏談話</p>
<p>吾國政府之外匯政策，向以安定外匯市塲爲主旨，冀藉外匯之安定，以保持一般經濟之安定。自二月間外匯調整爲美元國幣一萬二千元後，因國內物價之繼漲，投機之猖獗，致官定匯率失其作用。其結果一面則幟出與僑匯均形縮减，政府外匯收入因而减少，一面則進口商人與製造工業雖得到低廉匯率運入商品，但大都物品仍以黑市價格銷售，從中獲取過份利得。政府以外匯收入减少，不得不逐步减低官價結匯數額，正當商業，當然受到相當影響。而大部外匯反落於走私商人之手，消費者未得絲毫利益，以致商業業“趨停滯。政府有鑒於此，認爲對於外匯及輸出入管理辦法，有加以修正之必要。依照修正後之辦法，凡民生日用必需品，其價格可由政府統制者，如棉花，米，麥，麵粉，煤及焦煤仍由中央銀行供給官價外匯，其餘核准之輸入品及財務上之支付，概由指定銀行依市價結售，輸出及僑匯所得外匯，亦得依市價售與指定銀行。依精密估計，除上列大宗民生日用必需品仍由政府以官價結匯外，其餘輸出輸入，收付金額幾可相抵。故修正辦法實行後，外匯市堪可望漸臻安定。政府仍顧慮或以出入口季節之不同，或以其他原因出入不能時時相抵，將設立外匯平準基金委員會以杜匯價之暴漲暴落。自修正辦法實行後，深望輸出及匯入匯款得以增加，加以輸入仍予嚴格管制，國際收支當可漸趨平衡。政府之外匯資源充裕，則正當商業自可日見起色。目下舉世缺乏美元，吾國自不能不未雨網繆，一面增加外匯來源，一面節用外匯，幷須力事爭取海外市塲。數月來工商及人民團體暨經濟專家倡類此意見者甚多，政府經縝密考慮，決予斟酌採納。惟一切辦法之成敗，均繫於民衆之合作。此項辦法，採之大衆公意，想必能得到大衆之擁護。深盼經營出口商家，不以市價匯率較前優越，乘機競購抬價，以致影響海外市塲，重使輸出不振。更盼進口商人，勿以市價匯率之存在，乘機囤積抬價須知中國人民購買力有限，價格過高，必使銷路　少，營業蕭條。此理至明，韋予了解。　最後有一忻慰之事，即吾國與香港政府關子貿易外匯問題之交涉，業已圓滿解決。香港政府已另有聲明，此項協定之訂定，有裨于中港兩方其同利益者甚大。而於本修正辦法之推行，更有請助之功。鄙人對於香港政府之台作精神，深表忻感。</p>
<h3>國務會議决議文</h3>

<h3>中植油廠派員考察　台省主要物產情形　王龍生遊台歸來談此行經過及感想　樟腦外銷已陷停頓</h3>
<p>經濟部中國植物油料廠，鑒於台省需用肥料孔股，而戰後各國肥料產量不豐，又爲各國　購目標，致來源奇缺，該廠爲推廣植字豆餅銷路，曾派上海辦事處經理王龍生氏，於前　中旬，赴台遍赴各地視察，除亟謀豆餅銷路之推動外，並注意該省一般主要產品之出口情形。王氏已在台公畢，於上週杪返滬，據談此行經過及感想稱：以往本廠豆餅，皆在滬市就地推銷，故台胞對本廠植字豆餅尙無認識，爲將來經常大量推銷計，對該省應予密切注意。往時台灣年需豆餅二十萬噸，多數由東北大連直接運往，現因東北來源减少，且餅價略貴，農民不勝負担，致消費量已大吿銳减。</p>
<p>生產概況</p>
<p>關於目前台省主要產品情形，工氏稱：樟腦廠尙存有改良乙種樟腦精製樟腦·腦片·腦錠等貨，約計四五百噸。以後逐月可產六十噸，全年不過七百二十噸。距戰前最高產額，尙差兩倍。半年以來，樟腦外銷，幾陷停頓狀態。惟歐洲各國，對我國樟腦，不能經常供應，不得不向他處採用入造樟腦。近聞德國等地人造樟腦廠，均已復工，大量生產，價格爲每磅美金七角，較台省產品，幾廉一半，此實爲台灣樟腦外銷一大威脅。（二）台省出產製造化妝品原料，以香油最著名者，如由樟油衍生者，爲賽法洛，有加利油，及芳油三種。前二種係銷歐陸各國，後一種可銷英美歐陸等地。　法洛可月產十噸，有加利汕及芳油可各產五噸。此外又有香茅油一種，亦爲外銷佳品，今年台省預計產量不到一萬五千台斤，遂致供不應求。滬商競購，汕價已由每台斤台幣四百五十元漲至六百餘元。（三）鳳梨生產近况，全世界生產鳳梨，以夏威夷，馬來亞，台灣三地最爲著名。台產品質不如夏威夷，但價較廉，馬來亞產品較台產更康，但品質不如台省高。近因我國馬口礦缺乏，罐頭原料稀少，影響鳳梨輸出。戰前每年最高生產額爲一百六十萬箱，大部運銷國外，今年預計量十萬箱，每箱約値國幣三十萬元。而製罐價値、約佔總成本百分之四十五，此實爲目前亟應注意者。</p>
<p>工業復興</p>
<p>王氏末述游台觀感稱，光復後，台灣各種石油·鑛產·工業·如煉油廠，油礦。鋁業公司，銅礦公司等，均由資委會接辦。其他重要工業，如糖業公司，機械造船公司，電力，碱業。水泥。紙業。肥料等公司，亦由該會與省府合辦。情况至爲良好，多已修復開工。現各廠範圍及業務量大者，爲糖業公司，依照其原定計劃，明年度擬增產至五十萬噸，倘接每噸美金五百元計，總値二億五千萬美元。目前台省各種工業條件，如電力·人工·建築材料·化學器材等，均遠較上海爲廉。開辦工廠，最合理想。台省人口約有六五〇萬，最大港口爲基隆，可停泊一二萬噸外洋輪隻。倘中樞當局能對目前進出口措施加以改善，促使貿易活躍，台省必係重要商塲之一。合省年需肥料·棉花·棉織品之進口，以及糖·茶·樟腦鳳梨等貨之出口，數量均有可觀，殊堪注意云。</p>
<h3>全國棉產調查統計</h3>
<p>紗聯會決定分三次發表</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國紗廠聯台會第廿一次理監事聯席曾議，於昨日下午四時卅分起，假中國紡建公司會議室舉行。到理監事十五六人，由東雲章主席，至七時許散會。</p>
<p>昨日會議，報告事項有：（一）本年度全國棉產調查統計，決定於本年八月卅一日，十月廿日，十二月廿日，分三次發表。（二）全國紗廠錠子布機總調查，現已大部就緒，擬於最近發表。（三）各區公會，計一區重慶，二區陝西，三區昆明，六區蘇浙皖，七區天津，八區漢口，九區育島，均巳先後成立，現俟東北區成立公會後，則全國各區公會，均已組織成立。</p>
<p>討事項有：（一）決元於本年九月廿日起，在滬召開全國紗廠聯合會會員大會三日，改選理監事。並先推吳味經·榮爾仁·劉丕基·奚王書等七人，組大會籌備委員會，以吳味經爲召集人。（二）兩廣蘇北水災捐款，第六誠公會擬攤二百五十憶元。（三）紡織業在工業中最佔重要地位，決議上呈行政院，請朮兩點：（甲）全國經委會中，應包括紡織業委員二人，俾資爲決第時之聯繫。（乙）對日商務考察團，紡織業代表至少應五席。</p>
<h3>東北匯兌提高</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十七日電〕東北匯兌，前經東北行　經委會規定，以瞻家匯款，每人每月不得超過東北流通券三萬元爲限，茲以物價高漲，流通券三萬元，不敷實際需要，郵局現已奉准，提高至流通券十萬元。按現時國幣十二元，折合流通券一元之比率，約合國幣一百二十萬元。</p>
<h3>綢貨人心激昂</h3>
<p>昨日因外匯照市價曼賣宣佈後，綢貨市塲，雖値星期，人心異常激昂，被面狂跳一百萬元，華强貨最大做到一千一百七十萬元，大誠貨比華强大起十二三萬元。格子璧縐喊三萬七千元左右，但乏成交。其餘各貨喊價，均高百分之五至十，不過買賣雙方，俱存觀望，成交甚稀。</p>
<h3>捲烟市氣上揚</h3>
<p>昨日捲菸市况，雖值星期，市氣頗爲激昂，蓋因政府公佈改善外匯管理後，各方揣測紛紜，以捲烟原料係非必需品之一，嗣後恐將照黑市匯價計算，致成本不無影響，貨主咸存觀鑿。而取巧者拉提，市氣遂扶搖直上。</p>
<p>十支大英烟又創新高峯，爲一千二百七十萬，迄午收爲一百六十五萬，比上日軋升六十五萬。老刀牌亦漲三十七萬，爲八百八十萬元。哈德門升三十五萬，爲七百七十五萬元。華商廠烟美麗大克留斯百重金白蘭地等熱門貨，步挺甚勁，全綠雙斧獨呈平定，惟收後轉售頗多，市氣有帶軟之勢。</p>
<h3>湘鄂贛煤礦業　向政府請求三點</h3>
<p>〔中央社長沙十七日電〕湘鄂贛區煤礦業同業公會，已組織成立，頃向政府提出請求：（一）貸款協助擴充設備，以增產量。（二）煤礦業從業員工准予緩役。（三）令飭鐵路及航業機關優先裝運煤斤，以濟煤荒等要案。</p>
<h3>川實業界準備　對日輪出貿易</h3>
<p>〔本報成都十七日電〕對日開放貿易聲中，川實業界積極準備對日輸出。川手工業聯合會十七日召開大會，決定改良出品，準備外銷川特產，將以絲爲對日輸出主要物。建　已擬具計劃，在南充等地增產秋繭三千五百萬担。</p>
<h3>本市錫紙產量　足供烟廠需求</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據工商輔導處調查：以本市各廠設備而言，每月錫紙產量可達二萬箱，此數可供捲烟廠包裝捲烟十二萬箱。本市各烟廠之總生產量，每月平均約十萬箱，其他各地之總產量，據錫紙業估計約合本市之二成。故全國烟廠每月所需錫紙，本市出品已足供其需要。現各烟廠除用錫紙包裝外，尙有採用鋁箔者。該項鋁箔來自國外，本埠瑞商之華鋁鋼精廠亦有大量出品，惟其用作原料之鋁塊，仍需由國外輸入。用鋁箔或錫紙以包裝捲烟，其功用僅在防潮，二者相較，錫紙或且較優。在此外匯短絀之時，各烟廠似應改用國產錫紙，不獨可免除外匯上非必要之消耗，且可使吾國錫紙工業維繫不墜。</p>
<h3>國行發起組織　國民所得研究會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國民所得的統計，對於經濟研究和政策決定，關係極大。國民所得，資本累積和國際收支三種數字，是一個國家從事經濟決策最低需要的基本數字。中央銀行經濟研究處，爲提供國民所得正確統計資料，俾配合經濟決策需要起見，特發起組織我國國民所得聯合統計研究委員會，已徵得財政，經濟，農林，糧食，內政，交通，社會各部，及資源委員會，中央研究院等有關機關贊同，合組籌備委員會，積極推動其事，聞不久即可正式組織云。</p>

<p>新醫與新藥</p>
<p>— 上海市醫師公會主編</p>
<h3>請醫政當局加以考慮</h3>
<p>— 直公</p>
<p>中國醫師之缺乏，盡人皆知，其曾深入內地者尤有「身受其痛」之感，蓋一旦遇病，即欲求中醫診治亦不可得，遑論乎鳳毛麟角之西醫哉？惟近聞京滬杭兩綫有「無照」醫師二千餘人，而以上海一地更多。此種畸形之怪現狀，乃不良政治所造成，若輩爲產生活起見，明知此爲殺人不見血之畸形生，旣不合乎民主政治之社會，當亦自愧於內心之難安。然捨此以外，別無其他糊口之計，亦惟有聰天由命，從中鬼混一番而已。惟其中亦有多數前進而好學之士，每欲尋求精神食糧之補充而不可得者。於社會中之工於心計者藉此時機投其所好，以學爲餌而誘其財，浸假而利用其羣衆之多而私授其推戴之策。藉此而得進身於從政之途。所謂重「量」而不重「質」之說，胥其誘惑羣衆之工具也。苟全國人民之代表均以此類方式而取得之，則他日爲政之時其所擬定之建國策略終是旁門左道之說也明矣。譬如國家之遇患亂也，不剿即撫，決不可坐視其患亂之日漸蔓延。今茲無照醫師之所以誤入歧途者，亦無非醫政當局舉棋不定有以致之耳。爲今之計，旣已不能以剿除之法去之，則惟有以訓導之法安之。取其訓而可敎者爲醫師，區分其不可敎者爲護士，分配於內地各處以利貧病則其庶幾獲得兩全之計歟？奈何爲政者計不出此，措置乘離，而最近上海市政府又不知根據何種法規於其年六月初忽有考試無照醫師之舉，藉此發給臨時開業執照。似此醫政方面之重大事件而考試院反爾不聞不問，豈上海非中國之領土歟？頗聞無照醫師去年曾一再向政府請願，然而至今尙不見政府之明白表示。際茲行憲之期不遠，爲政者應速召集無照醫師而加以考試甄別，其不及格者施以「再敎育」，勿使工心計者以及玩弄羣者得以利用，此因糾正社會畸形之德政，於國家社會均有利賴也。</p>
<h3>補藥的濫用</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>在目前醫藥界裏面約畸形發展，殊屬指不勝屈，本文所提的補藥濫用，乃係最不可忽視的一件事。本來呢，在已經接受了幾十年迄今還沒有洗刷的「東亞病夫」的綽號，重之以歷來贊美婦女們「弱不禁風」「能作掌上舞」一類的形容詞之下；這都應視作等閒，用不着大驚小怪的。但是實際上的情形，是決不僅限於此的；我敢說至少有半數的例證，是不見得適應的。舉二件習見的例證來說：乙種維他命一，是抵抗脚氣痛的專劑，但結果應用到本來的病，恐怕只佔全部十分之一二；不錯，他在醫學上應用之範圍是很廣闊，然其中一部分的濫用（可用可不用，不啻變相之調味劑；）是無可諱言的。丙種維他命是療治壞血病，紫血斑病等專劑，並兼有抵抗傳染，療治出血等功効的；然和前述諸症毫無關係而應用者亦不在少數，有些人則完全視作補劑，甚至以爲補藥係多多益善，而要求醫師一每日注射大量以求速効的。這漆黑一團，乃係我國醫界特有現象，爲歐美諸國所望塵莫及的；此中責任，醫師方面自不能說完全沒有，事實上大部分病家之一知半解，强不知以爲知，醫師們雖想力挽在瀾，結果也不過和「蟷臂當車」而已！</p>
<p>病家道一種心理之構成，由來已漸，可說有千百年傳統的根據。尤以有錢的人們，他們平日美尊處優，非進補不足表示其高貴身份。譬如他訴說頭暈，耳鳴，目眩，疲倦，四肢無力等症象；儘管是「雀戰三夜」「跳舞通宵」失眠所致，但此根因，係遠不及說他身體虛弱之易動聽。復以關於補藥之有百利而無一弊，是向來所公認，新醫方面之注射劑，又能直接輸入體內，無須經過消化器官，決不致有胃腸不能容納，以致阻塞之顧慮的。結果當然係大衆所趨；而補藥名行市，也水漲船高，與其他日用必須品，成晋楚之爭覇了！</p>
<p>藥一到了濫用，則種種反常現象也因之產生；據作者一時想到，已有下列數種可述：（一）非補藥作補藥用。例如葡萄糖鈣注射劑，係用作治療肺結核症，其他用途並不廣；但結果當作補劑而長期注射者也不在少數。（二）無意義的應用。此中可提出的爲純凈葡萄糖注射劑。他係有利尿解毒及增加營養之作用的；因爲葡萄糖與鹽。水三者都無須經過生理上之消化作用，而能直接由血液輸入人體，以供需要的；在急性傳染病如傷寒，他係長期沾染床褥，食物减量，而又加以每日高熱之消耗，其病者之須增加營養乃係必然的。他的注射當然是適應的。其他各病症也可據此而推。但在一般自命虛弱，而三餐無缺之病家，其胃陽消化機能完全健全無損，則無須多此一舉的；因為他的營養，儘可由食物上究全供給的，即或消化機能薄弱，也可由胃腸方面對症治療，無須越俎代笣的。（三）分量上之增加。這是根據補藥有益無害「多多益善」的心理構成的，上面所舉每日注射大量丙種維他命爲其中之一例。關於乙種維他命一之用法；脚氣病神經炎等症係需用大量方見効，像消化不良，胃腸疾患，病後虛弱，四肢無力等情，只須用少量已足够，用大量則迅速排泄，與實際上毫無補益的，且浪費金錢，殊不經濟。但一部分的病家，總覺多化金錢，滿不在乎，補藥量愈大，收效亦愈增的；反嫌醫師們之用量求準，係計較錙銖，不免寒酸相的。作者有一次和同道某君曾提及，他笑答：我想不礙罷，至多尿汗現香氣罷了；斯眞名符其實的「香汗淫淫」了！一笑！</p>
<p>那末，在何種時期必須用補藥呢？道在本文中是例須解答的；根據醫學上之需要，則有如下所述：（一）大病後；（二）經過外科手術後；（大都爲失血逾度，體力减弱；）（三）婦女妊娠期及生產後；（四）惡液質之病者；（五）先天不足；（六）其他；關於末一項包括較廣究竟適應與否，須完全由主治醫師當面當時決定，決非本文所</p>
<p>關於補藥之應用，在醫師一方面，當然係有根據，不能隨隨便便的。單拿補血一項來說，這在面黃肌瘦或面色蒼白的人們，祗須馮表表面察已可明究竟了；但其他的決不能按此例，須不厭精詳，詳加診查，其血色素之成分，紅白血球數目，構造情形，以及有何病因潛伏等種種；都不忽略的。一般人以謂人體內血液不厭其多，故補血是決無流弊可言的，這是完全曲解。隨便舉一例來說，對於血管硬化的患者就不相宜。在目前量流行的補血劑肝膏，對於糖尿病患者，似乎也不適宜的。近來荷爾蒙劑特別流行，內中蓋世維雄注射劑尤屬天之驕子；其實他並非補藥，少年人尤不宜輕用（有病患適應者例外），並且變本加厲地喜用重量（25mg），嫌10mg量太輕，殊難究其目的之所在，興言及此，誠所謂心所爲危不得不發了！</p>
<p>總之，補藥並非不可用的；但適應與否，其取捨之權，是操在醫師掌內的。作者謹具百分之誠意，俯請病家們努力加勉纔好</p>
<h3>請投考醫學生注意（續完）</h3>
<p>— 阮尚烝</p>
<p>吾並不反對大部份愛國者要保存國家之精神與國文國粹等理論，但是也要顧到事實。科學在中國尙未到獨立自主的地步，求知者非讀原版書不可，而中文之應用於科學頗感不便。有心之士每欲改良中國之文字使其方便而能應用於科學，然決非短期內可以實況。爲救急起見，祗可捨遠而圖近。於是飽學者專事於研究，有幹才者執掌衛生行政，求知岡利，爲己爲國，無一不着，至於如何改良中文，如何使醫學中國化，尙在政治平定後方始談得到。試觀日耳曼民族之歷史，在他們文化水準尙甚低落時，以能講法國語者爲漂亮人物，例如復興日耳曼民族之Friedrich大帝，其語言寫作，甚至其宮殿名稱全用法文。以後日耳曼民族之文化日益改進，遂右歌德等大文豪，創作美麗之德文。於是人民漸捨法文而專用德語矣。三十四年七月十日重慶大公報載參政會大會聰取敎育部報吿中有「並擬提倡外國語教育」一言，諒必有深意存焉。是以醫界中全用英文，遂更有根據。</p>
<p>國內衛生機構中不論寫作談話旣均用英語，於是不習英文而精通他國文字者，合作上諸多不便，即有鶴立鷄　者，雖幸而不被視爲旁門左道，但終亦無濟於事，如某校長某局長之退避賢路即其明證。蓋亦識時務耳。湯　舟先生今春出國時曾語余曰「吾之所以能立足於衛生界以略識英文耳。」是又一個堅强的佐證。蓋湯先生爲日本千華畢業生，而又能解英語署也。</p>
<p>政府不以習醫而開業爲是。但事實上習醫而不解英語者若不願當衛生界支小卒時，除開業外甚鮮其他深造與發展之機會，試觀事實可以證明。凡志願習醫無意於開業而欲他日在學術上或事業上有所發展者，投入英語之醫學校實較投入非英語之醫學校便利多多。近人常語醫學人員如此缺乏，不敷全國支配之用，然所缺者乃習英語之醫學人員。某機構也人手不够支配。然某醫學院之畢業生形同失業，非政府政策之才盾，實在事實之內幕如此。深望投考醫學院者切勿誤入歧途</p>
<p>作者爲一不擅英語之醫人，根據過去之經騐與事實而作忠吿，識者必不以余言爲過。至若此文出諸一個祇解英語者之口，則難免不生反感矣。</p>
<p>俊靑按阮醫師此文大概是有感而發。吾人以醫者立塲，當然希望醫校無派別，醫師無派別，尤其希望衛生行政方面之執政者無派別，然後在衛生和同事方面能右進步。否則日惟以國際問勢力之消漲爲轉移，不但使當局者舉棋不定，疲於奔命，且亦喪失獨立國家之意義矣。至其所謂「於是不習英文而精通他國文字者，合作上諸多不便，即有鶴立鷄羣者雖幸而不被視爲旁門左道，但終亦無濟於事，如某校長某局長之退避賢路即其明證」諸語，雖未指明爲何人，予亦不欲妄加推測。惟予深知有某醫師者在嚴前不過一普通醫師而已，在學術研究方面可謂毫無建樹，嗣後出洋鍍金不到一年，速公共衛生之門徑亦未摸着，歸國之後，居然在兵荒馬亂中夤緣得醫政要職，浸假而至於某局長。以此種人而担任斯職，又烏得而不醫事者哉？若謂其以派別不同而安於位，則固不盡然也。</p>
<h3>「范氏醫論集」自序</h3>
<p>— 范守淵</p>
<p>我把我近幾十年來，零零星星，陸陸續續，所發表的文字，收集起來，整理了一下，編成這一部書；除了一小部分遺漏了或剔除了之外，大部分都收在這裏頭了。我又把我這一部書的名目，定爲「范氏醫論集」。</p>
<p>我刋行這一部言論集，實實在在，內心發生無限的感慨。</p>
<p>我開始寫作這類衛生醫藥的文字，差不多有近二十年了。在我寫作這類文字的時光，都是一時的感想，感想到當時的社會環境，需要我這一類的文字，需要我道一次工作，才吿我動手來寫作的。所以，這裏頭的文字，無論是衛生醫學常識的一方面，或者是言論評述的一方面，都是當時的事物，給我一個刺激，由於事物的剌激，而發生出一種感想，根據當時的感想，才來寫作成這一類的文字。我寫作這一類文字，是很想給我國的醫學文化，發生一點推動作用的，給一般缺乏醫識的大衆，起一些醫藥常識，衛生攝養的灌輸功用的。尤其是想使他們，對於本身的健康問題，醫學問題，有個正確的理解和眞確的認識。斷斷沒有預想到，到了今日——將近二十年之後的今日，這些過去的文字，一大半還收集在這裏，來付梓出版的。到了今日，中國社會，還要我來把這些過去了的陳言陳跡的老文章，也收集在這裏頭，來出版問世，這並不是我的一件榮幸的事，相反地：却證明了中國的社會，在這悠長的歲月過程中，醫學文化這一問題的進步，實在遜步得太緩慢了。（待續）</p>
<h3>西瓜之醫藥觀</h3>
<p>— 壽梧青</p>
<p>西瓜爲果類之一，老幼咸知，盛暑剖食，心神俱爽，且取價低廉，尤爲貧富階級之共同消夏品，非若橘蘋葡梨之貴族化，價格高昂，貧苦階級難能染指。</p>
<p>西瓜種類頗多，品質不同。據賣瓜者言，上海西瓜，以平湖成名，形長圓而甜，大小不一。亦有來自蘇北崇明一帶者，質較炙，形略長，兩端尖。又有來自他處者，其形圓。或有謂瓜之來路不以形而異，獨以質而別，大約平湖瓜甜，崇明瓜淡，實無一律之定論。</p>
<p>按西瓜原爲異域產品，史傳契丹征回紇，獲得瓜種，遄返中原，自傳入以來，迄今已有相當歷史。種植之法，與其他瓜類相同。舊歷二月間，播種子於土，覆以牛糞，待其萌芽，移植成行，漸長，產五角形掌狀之葉，莖如縣，柔曲細軟，蟠踞於土面，漸次蔓延，長達一二丈，生淡黃色瓣狀之花。花落結果，肥大如斗，色青或綠，或靑綠相間，因其來目西方，故名西瓜。自五代以還，遍及大江南北，因其土壤種植方法肥料氣候之不同，故其形其色，大相懸殊，甚至瓜之內部，亦有紅，黃，白，淡紅，淡白各色之分。至於口味之濃淡，除選種培植而外，復與天氣有直接關係。或謂今年雨水較多，瓜味較遜，似非無因。</p>
<p>按舊醫藥性言西瓜味甘淡稍寒，無毒，或謂大量微毒，功能止渴，消暑，潤津，利尿，多食有傷脾胃，使胸膈飽悶，腹部膨脹，時作嘔氣狀。身體贏弱之人，育部脹氣，腸部發酵，因之產生多量氣體，輕屁滾　而流。古籍載夏季食瓜多，秋令瀉　重。又謂昔防州太守陳逢原，喜食瓜，食必甚多，久食之後，忽腰痛背痛，不能舉動，遍訪名醫診治，歷久而愈。（延壽書）又西瓜與油餅同食，能傷脾臟云。</p>
<p>按新經騐言，較長兒童，消化正常，身體健康，食少量西瓜，未始不可。若褓嬰兒，或較長兒童，食瓜過多，非特無益，且甚有害。常見食瓜過多，引起上吐下瀉，成急性胃腸炎，或因瓜皮洗漝不潔，汚水沾染，引起他種傳染病，如傷寒，霍亂，痢疾，乃最著者。</p>
<p>西瓜之肉，稱之日　。性能解熱。古時中醫藉，有天生白虎湯之稱，熱症病人，或有藉此爲解熱淸凉劑者。又謂其汁能治口瘡。皮甘凉無毒，普通多棄於街頭，但蜜餞醫炙，可供食用。或有炒而佐膳者。食瓜過多，飽脹致悶，可用瓜皮煎湯解之（事林廣紀）</p>
<p>瓜　之間，雜有瓜子，黃黑不一，無毒，曬乾貯藏，炒而食之，其味無窮。甜香　炒，各得其宜，解閒消遣，尤稱上品。江浙一帶，新年宴客，尤多採用。姑蘇瓜子，素稱獨步，香脆適口，行旅必備。或有老年病人，血壓亢進，生食其仁，謂可使血壓减低，俗稱單方，但效力未確。曾見中年病人，服生瓜仁達三個月之久，檢騐結果，其血壓自160度降至150度。所食瓜子，總量達二十斤之多云。</p>
<p>西瓜爲我國果產，歐美醫籍，未見記載。英國藥制，美國藥制巨　中，亦未見其門類。其定性定量之分析，均未能詳加考核，但細加檢騐，其中不過含少量炭化水素（糖　類），大量之水份，微量之維他命HC，無卡路里（熱力單位之名稱）之供給，無滋養成份之要素。揆其實際，一瓜之値，充其量，不過聊勝冰糖白開水一杯已耳。或謂多吃西瓜，有减免生瘡生　之效，或謂多吃西瓜，有治便閉之功，或謂多吃西瓜，能止瀉痢，或謂多吃瓜汁，能治傷塞高熱，或謂多吃西瓜，能治腎臟發炎，凡此種種皆爲無稽之談，未能以醫學之觀點爲根基，無足深信。</p>

<h3>工程和科學</h3>
<p>— 趙南</p>
<p>飛機從發明而逐漸趨於實用，可說是近代人類文化最高度的表現。最近二十年來，航空方面，以及其他工程方面，都是突飛私進。當年愛因斯坦（A.Einstein）發明的相對論（Theory　of　R），僅是一個質量變為能量的簡單的方程式；E＝MC2是能量是質量，C便是光的速度。但是到了今天，這個方程式巳在原子能中實際應用。再舉一個例，今天的飛機，速度可達每小時627哩，航程十萬哩，高度數萬公尺。這些數字，都非二十年前所蒙想到的。</p>
<p>為什麽最近二十年來，工程方面有這樣飛躍的進展呢？這個問題，非常重要，我們必須加以研討，在二十年以前，工程上的進步，單常各方面實地經騐的累積。所以每件工程，必須行而後知，做好了再行試騐。如此，耗時耗豺，極不合算，當然工程上不能再有長足的進步了。</p>
<p>可是最近二十年來，工程方面不再單靠前人的經騐了。他們把經騐作為參考，用分析的方法，採用科學上基本的理論，相輔推進。單靠經騐，固然進步遲緩；但是祗有理論也是行不通的。二十年前的工程師，以為理論無補於實際，所以慘遭淘汰。</p>
<p>我們只知道牛頓（Newton）是個大科學家，他在物理學和數學上的貢獻，婦孺皆知，其實他還是個實地工作的橋樣工程師。再　如大數學家尤拉（Euler），他在數學上有一個公式，同時在材料力學（Strength　of　Marevials）中柱（Column）的研究上，也創造了一個劃時代的公式。</p>
<p>牛頓和尤拉等科學家的所以律大，就是他們能够把理論和實際相互配合。但是到了今天，科學上的理論逐漸深奧，實際工程也逐漸複雜，一個人欲規理論和實際的全豹，巳非力所能及此，今天的大科學家不能再工程師了。這種分工合作的傾向，一天天的在加深。</p>
<p>舉個例說，在水力學上，理論方面都假定說水是：完全流體”（Perlect　fluid），是不能壓縮（Non-Compressible）和沒有黏度（Non-Viscous）的，這樣就很容易地用數學來解決問題。但是照工程科學的眼光來看，水不但略受壓縮，並且它的黏度相當巨大。因此，水力學中所有的公式，最重要的還是實際經騐所得到的係數（Coefficient）。</p>
<p>在二十世紀初期，基本科學和工程學不幸而分道揚鏣，愈走距離愈遠。在這個時候，突然來了一個救星，這便是當時歐洲數學的權威，克拉因教授（Prof.Felfk.Klein）。他從歐洲啟程到美國來參歡芝加哥的第一次世界博覽會，發覓美國資源充足·大賦特厚。他覺得歐洲實屬無法與美競爭。唯一的辦法，只有將歐洲的工程學衛提高。他於是決心獻身於純粹科學和實際工程的聯擊。回到歐洲，就創設了應用力學系。這一系的學生，好多就是今天著名的工程科學家，像Prandtl　V.Kamani　Timoshenko;</p>
<p>Busemann　和Ackerest等等都是。可是克拉因老敎授的目的，一半固然成功，一半却失敗了。這許多學生，一大半便在今日的美國，入了美國籍，帮助美國來和歐洲競爭</p>
<p>自從克拉因老敎授創設了應用力學一系以來，工程科學便走上了正軌，二十年來工程方面便以空前的速度，突飛猛進，前途正方興未艾。</p>
<h3>無聲打字機</h3>
<p>— 湄</p>
<p>我們現在所用的打字機，都會發出「搭，搭，搭」的聲音，聽久了就感覺厭煩。許多工程師，都在研究如何能製浩無聲打字機，一價沒有成功。最近美國專利局發出了2418.698號專利許可證給康納德（Frederick　U.Conard）氏，准他依法專利他所發明的無聲打字機。</p>
<p>說起來，這個發明也無特別新奇的地方，只不過將打字機裏面的橡皮　的墊，再加上一層，像細孔裂縫般的格子。這務子的大小，洽和每個健頭上的字型那麽大，橡皮圓軸之內，另用鋼棒為中心，每打一字。務子就移出一格，且無振動，傳至兩旁。因此圓軸全體，均不發聲，這就是無聲打字機構造的原理。專利灌賣給了林下打字機，公司（UnderwoodCorporation），在不久的將來，可以有無聲打字機出現了</p>
<h3>北極的氣候</h3>
<p>— 宋勵吾</p>
<p>在地理上，北緯六十六度半以北的地區，統調之北極區域，北極專家威爾金氏（Sir　HuberiWilkins）則按氣候的觀點，以全年最熱月平均氣溫在攝氏十</p>
<p>區屬之，按柯本氏（WKoppeu）</p>
<p>世界氣候分類之定義，凡屬此類溫度範圍，地土永久冰　，作物不能生長，即耐寒之針葉樹如松柏之類，生長亦很困難，地面上僅有台蘇地衣等植物，是謂之苔原或凍漢氣候（Tundra）。），其南界約與北極園相合。此氣候帶以南最熱月雖在十度以上，然最冷月則低至負三度以下，冬夏顯著，所占陸地面積至廣，凡歐亞及北美大陸北部及格林蘭冰島等均屬之，除西北歐外大部尙未盡開發，景象荒野，與極地無大殊異，故亦併入本文所舉範圍內論列之。</p>
<p>影響氣候變化的因素頗為複雜，凡海陸之分佈，地形之走向與高下，日射角度之大小，及洋流之寒暖等，均為區別氣候性質及形成複雜，氣候之主要因子，故雖屬同緯各地甚或距離甚近的兩地，往往差別甚大，景象完全不同，故論區域氣候者，不可不注意焉，茲分區敘述如后：</p>
<p>（一）極地氣候北極為一大陸包圍之海洋盆地，深度達四千公尺以上，亞洲北美間有狹隘的白令海峽貫接太平洋大盆地，，北美與格林蘭及默洲間則為一較寬廣的通道與大西洋銜接。海洋幾全年冰凍，唯在夏季亦僅部分表面一曆融解，冬季一片堅冰，廣廷及於西伯利亞，北美和格林蘭海岸，附近綠海除西北歐暖流冲刷海岸外，餘如克拉海（KeraSea巴芬灣（Baffin　Bay）等亦完全冰凍。</p>
<p>北極氣候固以寒冷著稱，考之實際，其冬溫尙較諸外綠大陸高壓强大地帶，如西伯里亞東北坎拿大北部及格林蘭內陸等區域為高，唯冬寒期間過長，黑夜最長之地可達六月之久，夏季半年則反是，唯日射角度至低，光綫微弱，地面致熟影響不著。極點附近一月平均氣溫約-40C厄爾滋米爾島（Ellesmere　I.）以略具大陸性質，低達-48　C　至-51.C近海冰雪掩覆之地，略見溫暖，最冷月平均約-40　C至-29　C。灣流冲刷區域為極地最暖區，如法蘭士羅傑地（Frans　Tosef　Land）-24　C.，綠港（Green　Harbour）及斯匹次伯根（Spitsbergen）-22.5C仲冬西南風下上述島嶼西海岸溫可升達負十八度之上。</p>
<p>夏季雖晝夜照射，唯以角度至低，地面復有冰雪掩護，難以直接受熱，氣溫仍在冰點之下。迨六月終積雪融化，潮濕之地面氣溫上升仍緩，乾燥地土及地上物體本身雖可熱至攝氏一二十度，氣溫則終難超出攝氏四度，按過零星觀測結果，極點附近七月平均氣溫差近零度，極圈約四度半，據一九三七年蘇聯探險隊於北緯八十七度以北的冰塊上，測出該年六月平均溫度為攝氏零下二度，最高紀錄一度，七月平均0.2最高1.7C以全體論，極地平均年較差，約在十五度至廿度之間</p>
<p>（二）凍漠氣候　本氣候帶位於北極圈之南界亞歐和北美大陸部份，冬季日熱微弱，故寒　殊甚，北端北冰洋岸以受海洋調劑之踢，故不若內陸之劇。十一月至四月各月平均溫介於攝氏負十八度至負六十度，西柏利亞東北之咸爾霍楊斯克（Verkhoyansk）年平均溫僅.16C一凡平均-05.5。于八九二年一月某次觀測之-67.3C值為世界最低氣溫紀錄，故有世界「寒極」（Cold　ｐole）之稱。</p>
<p>大部地土經年凍結，積雪不化，港口封凍與極地無殊，其不同之點，乃本氣候帶有一冷短但足使植物生長之夏季存在，平均氣溫稍低於10.C，七八月正午時氣溫有達二十五至三十八度之高溫，此際地層一呎之內解凍，向湯坡地積雪融化，地面以直接受熱，而寒之乾生植物賴以成長，唯因下層土壤冰凍中故，及地面强風之頻、均足妨碍森林之成長，故縱在最有利地區，僅見灌木業或草原之景象耳。</p>
<p>（三）冷溫帶氣候北緯四十五度至六十六度半以內的區域，在地個分　中統　之冷溫帶，萬西　帶範圍，因　　位置之員，　冷洋流性質之不同，區域性氣候極為　著，複雜而多變，今就大　東西岸及內部分述如下：</p>
<p>A，大陸西岸處向風海岸尤以西北歐兼受墨西哥暖流之賜，無極端氣候，海洋性極為顯著及西北風為頻，全年暖濕多雨，年約二千五百毫米，年日溫差之小及秋多多雨爲其特徵</p>
<p>B，大陸內部自西海岸漸人內地，氣候變化校郎，大陸性漸著。如西伯利亞與中亞細亞間之斜米（Semipatinsk）氣溫為例，該地十一月至三月間月平均溫度均在零度之下，地面積雪，河水封凍，以一月最寒，差近負十入度；夏季頗暖，月平均氣溫過十五度者約三個月，年校差達四十度。全區城過渡季節極短，秋季乾燥，春季及初夏多雨，復以冰雪融解，常有氾濫之災，董　大河流下游均在北端，此時下流河床仍凍結如故也。（未完）</p>
<h3>原子時代的急性普羅證</h3>
<p>— 惠世</p>
<p>在今天的原子時代中，又有了一種名呌變鑼症的疾病，此症乃因與有毒之原子彈元素普鑼（Plutonium）有關而得名，其症能使頭髮灰白，肝臟受損，或生滑瘤（Done　cancer）。利用原子惟而產生動力，或其他用途之工業，其工作者因之即需對此種新疾病加以防範，一如舊工業中，工作者須對鉛，　及其他有毒元素加以防範者然。</p>
<p>雖然據我們今日所知尙無染此症之人類，但其對於動物之影響却已由試騐而證明其存在。急性之普通症，與人體整個被X射綫或鐳放射後之癥象相似，脾　收縮而肝臟大受損害。此種化學品侵入血脈時，先集中於肝臟脾臟，然後轉入骨內。　羅在皮膚侵入一年之後，侵入之地即將腄起，頭髪脫落，毒瘤隆起，四肢受傷癥狀嚴重。</p>
<h3>雷達盲目着陸</h3>
<p>— 萬功禹</p>
<p>用雷達帮助飛機盲目着陸，已經達到了重要試驗的階段。美國國內航空總局正在試用一個雷達　目差陸的計劃，　稱爲G.G.A（Ground　ControlledApproach），是在陸地上用雷達測得飛機的地位，再告訴牠應該怎樣降下。</p>
<p>這方法是麻省理工大擊發明的，在戰時，空軍方面將他用於惡劣氣候下，使飛機安全着陸，而得到極大的成功。在飛機塲一輛固定的拖曳車中，G.G.A的雷達發出一道旋轉的探照綫，能在任何氣候之下，照得二十哩以內的飛機。當一架飛機駛入這範圍以內，，工作員在雷達示鏡中看見了　，於是「呌」　下來，用無綫電指示她飛近機塲上空。</p>
<p>當飛機飛到十哩以內，又有兩個雷達開始工作，一個表明高度及降低的速率；另一個表明方向及距離，工作員能够看到一個放大許多倍的雷達顯影，在這上面他能够辨別出與滑道相差極小的距離，把淸楚的指示廣播給盲目飛機上操舵，而使牠着陸。</p>
<p>G.G.A的將來用途似乎是帮助不能携帶笨重而複雜議器的飛機，在商用航錢方面，牠至少在着陸及交通管制方面有極大的用處，但是所有這些方便，都要等到把現在的須要五個人駕駛及十萬美金的設置簡單化了以後，才能更廣泛地被採用。</p>

<p>世界每經過一次大戰，就有許多新發明的武器出現，如第一次世界大戰的坦克，和這一次的火箭，雷達，羅　，轟炸瞄準器，導火管和眾著名的原十彈，對於當時的戰局，都起了決定性的作用。誠然，現代戰爭是科學戰爭，是運用科學發明的尖端，來和敵人鬥爭。現代的戰爭，與其說是決勝負於疆場，毋寗說定成敗於實騐室。所以在戰爭期內，科學研究，進步眾速，發明亦多，集中人才，加緊進行，爭取時間，以制機先，這在結束未久的第二次世界大戰中，前期的德國，和後期的美國，科學家所努力從事的效果，的確是如此表現了。</p>
<p>本書是美國在這次大戰短短四年中，軍事科學研究成續的總記錄。也可說是歷史的一部分。著者為史學專家於戰時任科學研究局（Office　ofSeientific　Ressearchand　Development）的編慕對於美國戰時科學之組織，研究·發展·成精，和應用，都耳熟目觀，復以地位關係，與軍政大員，政府首腦，均有接觸，故凡所論述，翔實可靠，如數家珍。當戰事未終了前，均係軍事秘密，和平勝利之後，則為科學史</p>
<p>全書共分六大部段、都二十八章，附錄四種，插圖七十四幅。首論新武器之優勢贛賽，次論新武器之一極類及設計，次論化學戰。次論軍用醫藥，次論心理學在戰爭上的運用。最後論原子彈，凡科學人才及科學機關之總動員，戰略之科學研究，陸地戰，海面戰，潛　戰，兩棲戰，均分別論及，惟一目的，在爭取時間，打敗敵人，而所用之武器，則有新發明之雷達·羅瀾，火箭，及各種砲彈，炸藥，烟幕，偽裝，燃燒彈，噴火器，均樓述其發明的經過，使用的效果。至於醫藥方而，如防瘧，輸血，及血之代替品，配尼西　，殺虫，殺鼠劑，D.D.T，航空醫藥之研究，均詳加論述，最後則獨詳原子彈研究發明之經過，製造之步驟，試騐之情形、及在廣島，畏崎燃放放所收之效果，原原本本，有條不紊、加以敍述。方面之多，範圍之大，非魏歷其事，學騐俱富者，難成此書。</p>
<p>總而論之，讀此省一過，我們徐獲得許多新穎科學知識。和軍事知識外，更可作下述的結論：第一·美國遠識人士，早於日人俞襲珍珠港之前，即深知戰爭之日益急迫，美國終不免捲入漩渦，故在一九四二年，在故總統羅斯福睿智洞察之下首先成立委研學究局，聘著名科學家卜希博土（Dr.Vannevar　Bush）主持其事，以研究新武器及國防科學為任務，以作萬一之準備，第二，實行科學動員，凡大學，研究所，工廠，軍部之科學專家，技術人才，一律調整組配，立於原來崗位，任指定工作，更用合約包工方式專研某種問題，務使人盡其才，物暢其用，嚴密組織、加緊努力，計時課續，用成大功。第三，現代戰爭乃賭國運之冒險企問，集中國家一切人力，物資，財源，作孤注之　一　，幸而獲勝，亦大傷國家元氣，敗則亡國滅種，更不堪問，如濫用原子彈不加節制，直可毀滅文明而有餘，以戰止戰，烯望此為最後之世界大戰。第四，此次戰時醫葉之進步，如配尼四靈之發明，所可拯救之生命，必較此次戰爭所殺害為多。第五，原子彈研究，發明！製造之經過，不僅裘現科學之絕大進步，亦且表規科學象，工程師，實業家，甚至工人，通力合作之人類最大成功。至於本書文　之淸晰，插圖之美麗，猶其餘事，不必多　。</p>

<h3>Export/Import and Foreign Exchange Management Regulations Simultaneously Announced in Beijing and Shanghai; Special Committee Established to Handle Export Price Review</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The revised foreign exchange allocation and import/export trade regulations were simultaneously announced yesterday in Beijing and Shanghai. In Beijing, Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun and Director of the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau Dong XianGuang hosted a press conference to announce the regulations. In Shanghai, Vice Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan and Governor of the Central Bank Zhang Jia'ao hosted a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists at around 8 p.m. last night in the conference room on the third floor of the Central Bank. The documents consist of nine items: (1) Central Bank's proposal to revise the foreign exchange settlement methods; (2) Resolution of the State Council meeting on August 15; (3) Executive Yuan's approval of five categories of goods to be settled at the official exchange rate; (4) Executive Yuan's revised import/export trade regulations; (5) Executive Yuan's announcement of the Central Bank's foreign exchange management regulations; (6) List of members of the Export/Import Management Committee; (7) List of members of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee; (8) Remarks by Minister of Finance Yu; (9) Remarks by Governor Zhang. The revised temporary import/export trade and foreign exchange management regulations have been promulgated by order of the National Government. Key points are excerpted as follows: 1. The Temporary Import Management Committee and the Export Promotion Committee are immediately merged into the Export/Import Management Committee (before the merger, the Temporary Import Management Committee and the Export Promotion Committee will continue to work separately as usual, and external correspondence to the two committees should still be sent separately). 2. For imports and remittances from today onwards, (1) designated banks will continue to settle and sell foreign exchange at the official exchange rate for approved imports of cotton, rice, wheat, flour, coal, and coke; (2) designated banks will settle and sell foreign exchange at the market rate for other commodities approved for import before or after the promulgation of these revised regulations, and for approved payments of financial expenses. 3. For exports and remittances, designated banks will purchase foreign exchange supplied from exports or re-exports from China and from remittances from abroad (including checks and foreign exchange sold for consumption in China) at the market rate. 4. Financial expenses will continue to be handled according to previous regulations. A special committee will be established to handle the review and reporting of foreign exchange required under the "Financial Expenses" item. 5. Export procedures: After obtaining a CBC6A revised certificate certified by a designated bank, export merchants should submit the above-mentioned certificate to the Export/Import Management Committee for review before customs declaration for export, to verify whether the reported price is accurate and must provide legitimate documents as proof. The Export/Import Management Committee will establish various expert committees in Shanghai to specifically handle export price review matters. 6. The regulations for designated banks to purchase foreign currency securities shall be handled in accordance with previous regulations. 7. Issuance of import licenses for "self-provided foreign exchange" (foreign exchange deposited abroad before February 17 for import purposes): The issuance of import licenses for "self-provided foreign exchange" is temporarily suspended. The Export/Import Management Committee will establish a special committee to conduct thorough research on the following two points and provide opinions so that the committee can make a final decision: (1) imported goods that have arrived or have not arrived without an import license; (2) funds currently held abroad for import purposes. 8. The buying and selling of foreign currency securities shall be in accordance with Articles 17 and 35 of the amended Provisional Regulations for the Management of Foreign Exchange. Foreign exchange brokers intending to engage in the buying and selling of foreign currency securities shall register with the Business Bureau of the Central Bank. Registration forms can be obtained from the Business Bureau of the Central Bank.</p>
<h3>On the New Foreign Exchange Regulations: Hoping for National Cooperation; Speeches by Governor Zhang and Vice Minister Xu</h3>
<p>Governor Zhang made a brief explanation at yesterday's press conference, stating: The revision of the import/export foreign exchange settlement methods was first carefully discussed by the National Economic Council, then, on the 15th, it was presented to the State Council meeting and passed in principle. On the 16th, the Executive Yuan's Review Committee revised all relevant detailed rules, and it was only now that all relevant regulations were completed and publicly announced. He concluded by saying: Currently, every country is experiencing economic panic. It is only through the cooperation of the people that a way can be found to overcome difficulties. Our country is in a difficult situation, and it is impossible to formulate any perfect solution. However, the implementation of the measures depends on the cooperation of the entire nation to achieve success. My other opinions are detailed in my written statement, which I will not repeat here. Furthermore, foreign exchange policy is the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance, so I have specially invited Vice Minister Xu from the Ministry of Finance to attend and give a speech. Vice Minister Xu Baiyuan then delivered a written statement on behalf of Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun and announced the order of the nine documents. Finally, he stated the Ministry of Finance's position on this revision of the import/export foreign exchange settlement methods, hoping that the press would offer more guidance and support for the new measures. The success or failure of the new measures is not solely the responsibility of the government or the Central Bank, but depends on the cooperation of the entire society, especially the cooperation of the media, so as to maximize the effectiveness of the new measures.</p>

<h3>Five Categories of Imported Goods Approved for Settlement at the Official Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>The names of the imported goods approved by the Executive Yuan to be settled at the official exchange rate are as follows: (1) Cotton; (2) Rice, Wheat; (3) Flour; (4) Coal; (5) Coke.</p>
<h3>Key Points of the Central Bank's Proposal</h3>
<p>The key points of the Central Bank's proposal to revise the import/export foreign exchange settlement methods are as follows:</p>
<p>Since the official exchange rate was revised on February 17 of this year, prices have continued to rise, resulting in a significant disparity between the exchange rate and prices. Most of the imported goods settled at the official exchange rate are still sold at market prices, giving merchants extra profits without helping to stabilize prices. In terms of export trade, due to the limitations of the official exchange rate, there is no profit to be made from foreign sales, which is almost at a standstill and there is a risk that overseas markets will be taken over by others. Remittances from overseas Chinese are also evading due to the large difference between the official exchange rate and the market price, which has a significant and far-reaching impact on the balance of international payments and the national economy and people's livelihoods. The main condition of this method should be to reduce the exchange of foreign exchange in the black market. Therefore, smuggling of imports, especially in the ports of South China, should be curbed. It seems that one side strengthens the control of imports to reduce non-essential payments, and the exchange rate can seek a more natural level from legal trade, so that the long-stagnant export trade can be promoted, and remittances from overseas Chinese can also reduce leakage, so that the supply and demand of foreign exchange in the market gradually offset.</p>
<h3>US Treasury Bills Still Sold at the Official Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Our City] Xu Baiyuan, Vice Minister of Finance, stated at the press conference hosted by National Bank Governor Zhang at 8:00 p.m. on the 17th that US Treasury bills will continue to be sold at the official exchange rate and there will be no changes.</p>
<h3>Liu Weizhi Discusses Remittances from Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Our City] Liu Weizhi, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, recently expressed his satisfaction with the government's revised foreign exchange management regulations. Liu stated that in the past, because the official foreign exchange rate differed greatly from the black market rate, remittances from overseas Chinese were evading, and the country suffered inestimable losses. At a time when exports are sluggish, obtaining foreign exchange relies solely on borrowing, but this is not a proper solution. Therefore, we should pay special attention to the issue of remittances from overseas Chinese. Liu said that it is unfair to attribute the reason for the evasion of remittances from overseas Chinese to overseas Chinese, because they suffer too much loss when settling at the official exchange rate, and the country should adhere to the principle of fairness. Therefore, revising the foreign exchange regulations was long overdue, and its implementation at this time already feels late. Liu believes that the new foreign exchange regulations will enable the government to regain control of all remittances from overseas Chinese and replenish the foreign exchange fund. However, whether the new regulations can achieve the expected results depends on whether the overseas Chinese remittance agencies can cope properly. Liu pointed out that in 1937, remittances from overseas Chinese amounted to 580 million national currency, and in 1938, it amounted to over 700 million yuan. At its peak, remittances from overseas Chinese reached US$300 million per year. If the pre-war amount can be restored in the future, the benefits to the national economy will definitely not be insignificant.</p>

<h3>Economic Commission Member Huang Yuanbin Talks to Reporters about the Characteristics of the New Foreign Exchange Measures, Which Can Be a Transitional Method for Reforming the Monetary System</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Huang Yuanbin, a member of the National Grain Commission, told reporters on the 17th that the revision of the foreign exchange management and import/export trade regulations is the most reasonable transitional method for reforming the monetary system. He pointed out five characteristics of the method: (1) Foreign exchange policy should ensure reasonable imports, smooth exports, and no loss of remittances from overseas Chinese. In the past, raising foreign exchange rates had very short-term effects and expired after a period of time. The method set this time is nominally not raising foreign exchange, but in reality, it allows the foreign exchange price to be adjusted naturally, which can solve the problems of import and export and remittances from overseas Chinese, and can continue to be effective. (2) The method set this time stipulates that cotton, grain, fertilizer, and coal are supplied by the government, and the total value of foreign exchange at the official price is about US$150 million per year, which accounts for half of the total import value, and the remaining half is for other imported goods. In the past, foreign exchange and remittances from overseas Chinese obtained from export goods were about US$200 million per year. Except for a small portion of remittances from overseas Chinese that are remitted to Hong Kong, the rest is offset by the foreign exchange required for other imported goods. The demand is equivalent, and the Central Bank can borrow foreign exchange, so the market price of foreign exchange will not have a sharp rise and can be adjusted naturally. (3) It is most reasonable for the government to supply foreign exchange at the official price to purchase essential goods, and for other imported goods to be settled at the market rate. In the past, if the rich consumed gasoline supplied with foreign exchange at the official price, it was the tax paid by the poor. Such phenomena can be avoided in the future. (4) There is no fair market price for remittances from overseas Chinese, and as a result, remittances from overseas Chinese flow to Hong Kong, which is suitable for smuggling in South China. The market price in the new method is the same as the black market in Hong Kong, so remittances from overseas Chinese will no longer flow to Hong Kong. (5) The new method can stimulate the production of export goods, normalize imports, and reasonably adjust foreign trade. Huang also pointed out that there should be two supplementary measures to stop remittances from overseas Chinese from flowing to Hong Kong: (1) The remittance slips for remittances from overseas Chinese can be filled out in foreign currency and remitted back to the country, and they can be freely deposited into foreign currency deposits and exchanged for legal currency at any time. (2) Imported goods must be in accordance with the thrift method. After a certain period, all agricultural products will be confiscated nationwide. Huang concluded that to eliminate speculation and stimulate general production and people's employment, the reform of the monetary system is still needed.</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Market Will Tend to Stabilize; Lou Tongsun Discusses the Main Purpose of the New Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Lou Tongsun, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, told reporters on the 17th that the government's new foreign exchange measures, although somewhat late, are still a timely measure. The new policy is stricter in spirit than in the past in terms of import restrictions. China has always been an import-surplus country, and the balance of international payments has not been balanced. This type of measure should be understood by all. In order to achieve balance, the United Kingdom has also adopted emergency and strict controls. Before taking this measure, our government had conducted careful research and estimated the imports: (1) Cotton, (2) Rice, Flour, (3) Fertilizer, (4) Coal, coke, and other four kinds of essential goods for people's livelihood. The government plans to settle foreign exchange at the official price, with a total value of about 160 million US dollars. Other imported goods, such as kerosene, tobacco leaves, wood, and fuel oil, total about 282.4 million US dollars. The two together total about 442.4 million US dollars. In terms of exports, in addition to soybeans, minerals, and other goods that are bartered with foreign countries, export goods can earn about 182.4 million yuan, plus 100 million US dollars from remittances from overseas Chinese, and foreigners' expenses in (including diplomatic personnel and charitable organizations) are estimated at about 39 million, totaling 321.4 million. Comparing the two figures, the trade deficit is about 121 million. Therefore, the black market may be stimulated by this, but soybeans and minerals can earn 21 million, international relief funds can earn 25 million, and cotton loans can earn 15 million, totaling 121 million. The political changes can actually achieve balance. At the same time, Article 9 of the new regulations strictly restricts importers and foreign merchants from purchasing goods. Without obtaining a permit, they are not allowed to contact foreign merchants. According to the reporter, if everything can be implemented smoothly, the foreign exchange market will definitely tend to stabilize after a considerable period of time. After the foreign exchange stabilizes, import and export can return to normal and tend to be active, and the domestic market can also be active. This is the main purpose of this measure. It is hoped that Chinese and foreign merchants can understand this point and assist the government in implementing national policies to save the Chinese economic crisis recognized by the general public. Lou finally told reporters in a very confident tone that the Shanghai black market will definitely not fluctuate recently after the implementation of this measure.</p>

<h3>Peng Xuepei Arrives in Shanghai, Talks About Impressions of the Northwest</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Our City] Peng Xuepei, Member of the Executive Yuan, flew to Shanghai from Xi'an on the 16th. Peng told reporters on the 17th that the poverty in the Northwest is beyond imagination, and the development of the Northwest urgently needs to be implemented quickly with both short-term and long-term considerations. Peng believes that the current situation in Xinjiang is quite complicated, but except for a few ambitious elements who are creating chaos, most people are inclined to the central government and hope for peace and stability. Peng also said that the communists recently gathered 14 brigades of troops in northern Shaanxi and launched an offensive, which has been defeated by the National Army. A certain division of the National Army participating in this battle rushed to the front line from the rear. On the way, the officers and soldiers of the entire division were selfless and sleepless, lasting for four nights, which is truly commendable.</p>
<h3>To Enable Rational Data; Financial Advisor Plans to Go to Shanghai, Guangzhou, etc.; Delegation to Host Political Figures on Friday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] Weidemayer's consultants Hua Yu reporters, Weidemayer's delegation returned to Beijing on the 16th, and immediately began the final sorting and classification of the collected data. All data will be divided into three categories: most important, secondary, and unimportant, to let Liu Cao draft the report when knowing the priority election. Before leaving China, the Ling delegation will no longer travel as a group, and one or two consultants may go to several locations to work. Financial Advisor Ren Jins will go to Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places again, and another advisor will go to Hubei and Chongqing to conduct inspections. Weidemayer himself has no intention of traveling elsewhere. It has not yet been decided whether he will meet with visitors in Beijing and make an appointment to see Kugan again, and it is not convenient to declare in advance when he will see Chairman Jiang again. The invitation cards for the cocktail party to be held by the delegation on the 22nd have been issued yesterday. Many government directors, people from various parties, and social elites have been invited. It is heard that Weishi will reveal one or two achievements in the past four weeks, and express his gratitude to all parties that provide information. Mr. Hua Sheng also predicted that this week will be the most important and busiest time, and if there are no special events, no more press releases will be issued. Weishi did not meet with Bengue on the 17th, nor did he visit Chairman Jiang. He stayed at the Shanghai Road Embassy's official residence to work all day.</p>
<h3>TASS Falsely Reports on Weidemayer's Visit to China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently told reporters that regarding General Weidemayer's visit to China, TASS recently sent a telegram from Nanjing, stating that after Weishi came to China, he put forward some "harsh" requirements involving politics and military affairs as conditions for US loans. This news is completely fabricated and has no basis. According to the TASS report from Nanjing on the 10th, the conditions proposed by the US side included leasing some Chinese air force bases and supervising the work of various departments of the Chinese government.</p>
<h3>Vacancies on the Democratic Socialist Party's Government Committee; Replacements Already Internally Determined</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] It is reported that after the dismissal of Wu Xianzi and Li Daming from the Democratic Socialist Party's Government Committee and Political Committee, the vacancies are said to have been internally decided to be filled by Tang Zhuxin and Yang Xiaoming.</p>
<p>[Our City] The First National Congress of the Reformist Faction of the Democratic Socialist Party has been held in Yiyuan for several days. The third meeting was held on the 17th, attended by more than 60 people including Wu Xianzi and Liang Weishui. When discussing and reviewing the political platform proposed by the Review Committee, there was a fierce debate. Some people advocated deleting all the words "un-min speech", "warlord", and "capital of the wealthy" in the preface, and also abolishing similar rigid regulations on the restriction of private property and land in the articles. Some people opposed this proposal, and both sides insisted for a long time. Zuo Linfeng, Wang Jingdong, and others withdrew midway, and the meeting was once suspended. Wan Wuyu was on the podium, angrily tearing off the red strip of the presidium he was wearing, saying that he was old and could no longer see such scenes, and suddenly burst into tears. Later, Sun Baogang and Wang Shiming replaced him, and the latter gave way, and many were deleted and revised. As a result, it became a very moderate and neutral political platform. The agenda for today is to discuss various proposals in the morning and elect central committee members and standing committee members in the afternoon. The meeting may be closed on the 19th.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Control over South China; We Sign an Agreement with Hong Kong; Hong Kong Government Issues Statement Yesterday</h3>

Governor Zhang also received a statement from the Hong Kong government on the 17th, as follows: The Chinese government and the Hong Kong government, after lengthy and thorough negotiations, have reached an agreement on financial and economic issues of mutual concern. It has also been decided that the measures agreed upon by both parties will be of considerable benefit to the Chinese government's control of trade and foreign exchange in South China. Hong Kong, due to its special status as a transshipment port, has also taken into account the commercial interests that need to be protected. This negotiation was completed in an atmosphere of harmony and cooperation, which is sufficient to promote financial and economic cooperation between the two sides to cope with common problems and open a new era in the relationship between the two sides. The content of the agreement will be released in the near future.</p>
<h3>Returning from Dalian</h3>
<p>— Dong Xin</p>
<p>In the past, the Northeast only had two special municipalities, and Dalian was one of them. The cleanliness of its streets, the smoothness of its transportation, the convenience of its waterways, and so on, were all comparable to modern metropolises. Dalian's location is the lip and shield of the Northeast. Those with ambition to invade the Northeast all entered through here. For nearly fifty years, Dalian has not returned to the embrace of the motherland. Its strategic location is evident from this. After the Japanese bandits seized Dalian from Russia, they regarded Dalian as their own territory. They meticulously planned every aspect, constantly expanding, actively relocating islanders, and trying every possible means to develop and construct. As a result, it gradually became prosperous, but everything in Dalian was entirely controlled by the Japanese. Until victory came, the Japanese bandits surrendered, and the Dalian compatriots eagerly awaited the government's early takeover. However, reality did not meet expectations, and the Allied forces arrived first. So-called liberation and salvation were nothing more than that. Subsequently, bandit armies took advantage of the chaos, acting as bullies, conducting struggles and purges in various forms. The Dalian compatriots fell into deep misery once again, now desperately struggling. With their last breath, they cried out, "Dear motherland! Come and save us! Save us!" Two years ago, according to enemy statistics, Dalian's population was over 800,000 (including Japanese, Koreans, and Soviets). Now, with the repatriation of Japanese residents, the exodus of ambitious youth and wealthy individuals, and the escape of traitors, only about 100,000 people remain in Dalian. Adding the compatriots who fled from Jiaodong due to the struggles, the total is less than 200,000. Given the vastness of the Dalian urban area and the sparse population, the desolate and deserted state is self-evident. Regarding economic issues, the highest authority in Dalian, the "Fake Guandong Public Office," intended to manipulate the economy by deliberately issuing "Guandong Public Currency." Because I was part of the inspection group to Dalian, I prevented this action. Due to the delay, the people were aware, and the atmosphere grew tense daily, with inflation expected at any moment. Later, when there was no other option, a notice was issued stating that it was a rumor, and the matter was terminated. Later, a particularly vicious method was used to confiscate the assets of the people. All private funds were forcibly deposited into government banks, with the claim that stamps would be affixed. People generally believed this, assuming that after affixing the stamps, the money would be returned. Of course, they never imagined it would be confiscated, but once the money entered the tiger's mouth, they were helpless. When the deadline arrived, it was announced that the money would be returned based on the number of people in the household: 3,000 for adults and 1,000 for children, with the remainder frozen. Therefore, the economy was frozen, and the people suffered endlessly. When the inspection group was about to arrive in Dalian on June 1st, Dalian began scrubbing street slogans, changing police uniforms, and training civilians and shops on how to answer the inspection group's questions. It also began moving major factories to Jinzhou and preparing countermeasures for the inspection group's arrival. Street posts were increased, and the tea servers at the Yamato Hotel were replaced with special agents. When the inspection group arrived in Lushun, the reporter was in Dalian. According to the bandit army, the inspection group did not recognize the "Guandong Public Office" in Lushun, and the Soviet Union maintained an objective stance. Therefore, what should have been heard and seen was not, and only a superficial inspection was conducted.</p>
<p>Currently, in Dalian Bay, the only ships coming and going are those with the red star emblem. The items traded are very simple: one is military supplies, and the other is food. Food is loaded to be shipped out, and military supplies are unloaded. Recently, Dalian has experienced a food shortage, and a large ship called the "Lenin" has been dispatched, with a capacity of over 3,000 tons, regularly sailing to Zhifu, once a week. Military supplies are taken out, and wheat is brought back. Recently, merchants from Yantai have reported that grain prices there are increasing daily, and the people's lives are a struggle under oppression. Their only hope is for "takeover." We can guess the meaning of "poor people turning over," but the methods are ridiculous. Around this time last year, ordinary poor people randomly robbed passing goods on the streets, and theft became even more rampant. Later, almost no one dared to transport goods on the roads. The scope of the poor's power expanded excessively, which was unacceptable, so restrictions were imposed. Now, at least they can't openly rob, only steal secretly. The most tragic thing is the government buildings and residences left by the Japanese bandits. Apart from being occupied by Soviet and bandit army cadres, the interior wood, walls, and floors have all been demolished. The bandit army in Dalian has no sovereignty in anything. Compared to Jiamusi and Harbin, the state of terror is just beginning. Most of their staff are recruited from the lower levels, such as coachmen, rickshaw pullers, and ice cream vendors, who are all special agents. The Dalian bandit army wears full police uniforms (identical to the Shenyang police uniforms). When the inspection group arrived in Dalian, the Soviet Union claimed that this was a Chinese democratic allied army not subject to any control and that it was also implementing the Three Principles of the People. Before the inspection group arrived, a large number of bandit cadres were transported to North Korea for the Fifth Offensive Conference. Those who were transferred back were all in the Lushun and Jinzhou areas, and there were very few in Dalian city. In Dalian, the Soviet Union acts like a victorious country entering a defeated country. After the Soviet Union announced "no death penalty" on June 1st, drunk drivers in Jeeps immediately killed eight Chinese people, but there was no news of it in the newspapers, and no words of assurance on the radio. Is this democracy? Is this freedom of speech? The good residences at the foot of the Dalian mountains and the very tidy houses in Jinzhou are all occupied by high-ranking officials. Ninety-nine percent of the factories are empty. The most bizarre thing is that the people of Dalian still have a hierarchy: first the Soviets, then the bandits, then the Japanese, then the Koreans, and only fifth are the Chinese people. The Japanese often use women to please the Soviets and gain favor, so they can look down on the Chinese just like before. There are even many who collude with the bandits.</p>
<p>The patriotism of the Dalian compatriots is indelible, but there is a severe lack of spiritual and cultural sustenance.</p>

<h3>National Army Recaptures Zouping Like a Hot Knife Through Butter, Jiaozhou-Xingwang Road West Section Opened Up, Continues to Pursue and Annihilate Remnant Bandits in Western Shandong and Eastern Henan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Qingdao Seventeenth Dispatch] The National Army advancing westward along the Jiaoji Railway line, like a hot knife through butter, entered Zhangdian Station on the evening of the sixteenth, and will join forces with another National Army unit in Zhangdian. The western section of the Jiaoji Road is now open. Only a few small stations between Gaomi and Fangzi in the eastern section have not yet been recovered. The National Army is taking advantage of its victory to sweep and clear them out, which will soon complete the cleanup. [Central News Agency Jinan Seventeenth Dispatch] The National Army on the Jiaoji Line continues to make progress. The western National Army recaptured Zouping at 5:00 PM on the seventeenth. [Our Newspaper Jinan Seventeenth Dispatch] The Shandong war situation has taken the form of a whirlwind sweeping away fallen leaves. The National Army has achieved a comprehensive and decisive victory. Currently, the communist bandits have only left remnants of the Seventh Column in the central Shandong mountain area and remnants of the Ninth Column in eastern Jinan. The main remnants have retreated to the north bank of the Yellow River. Therefore, all areas south of the Yellow River are completely within the National Army's range. Only a few local communist bandit teams are being cleared out by the National Army. In recent days, the National Army's advance along the Jiaoji Road and on both sides of the north and south has been extremely smooth. They have not encountered stubborn resistance from the communist bandits along the way. In some cases, the communist bandits fled at the mere sight of them without even fighting. Many strongholds have been recovered by the National Army. Currently, there are no major bandit army forces in the Zibo mining area. The National Army is advancing from both the north and south and will recapture the area by evening. The areas north of the Jiaoji Road and south of the Xiaoqing River, including Qidong, Zouping, Changshan, Huantai, and Yangjiaogou, will be fully occupied by the National Army by tomorrow.

Chief of Staff Chen continued to express that the Communist Bandit's struggles have reached a dead end. Chen said: The deceitful and seductive methods by which the Communist Bandit instigated chaos have been exposed. Their current means are only division and massacre. The policy of division is difficult to be effective, while the massacre creates all kinds of horrific facts, which is only accelerating their demise. A clear proof of this is that the number of people who surrendered from the Communist Bandit before the end of June has reached more than 140,000. Chief of Staff Chen finally emphasized that our only goal in the Northeast is to recover the lost land, and this goal can only be achieved after the Communist Bandit is eliminated.</p>

<h3>Qualification of Journalists Must Be Strictly Regulated, Capital Journalists Association Cables to Provide Opinions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Seventeenth Dispatch] At the third joint meeting of directors and supervisors held by the Capital Journalists Association on the seventeenth, there was a heated discussion on the issue of determining the identity of journalists. It was generally agreed that the regulations should be strictly enforced, and a resolution was drafted and cabled to the industry across the country, urging unanimous support. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Central News Agency to all newspapers, news agencies, and journalists associations across the country: Journalists are responsible for guiding public opinion and are at the forefront of democratic politics. At this time when the country is moving towards constitutionalism, we feel even more the importance of their own mission. Regarding the issue of strictly determining the identity of journalists, the industry in various places has had discussions, and people from all walks of life are paying close attention. The people of this association serve the capital and dedicate themselves to the newspaper industry, believing that this issue must be resolved with the most rigorous attitude and the spirit of impartiality, so that journalists who serve the people will not be condemned by the people, and those who are responsible for leading public opinion will not be subject to the control of public opinion. We respectfully offer the following views to the industry across the country: (1) The qualifications of journalists must be strictly regulated. Journalists associations in various places must conduct strict reviews of applicants, and Article 1 of the Journalists Law promulgated by the National Government in 1943 but not implemented is very appropriate and can be used as a benchmark. The law stipulates that anyone who works in a daily newspaper or news agency as a publisher, writer, editor, interviewer, or who is in charge of publishing or advertising is a journalist. The spirit of the law is very rigorous. When this association was established last year, the regulations on membership qualifications were based on this law. However, considering the importance of proofreaders in the newspaper-making process and the fact that the news reporting by broadcast journalists is no different from the work of newspaper journalists, we referred to precedents in various countries and included these two types of employees in the scope of journalists. This amendment is offered to the industry across the country for reference. This association is very strict in reviewing the qualifications of applicants. Given the abundance of newspapers and news agencies in the capital and the large number of reporters stationed in Beijing from other places, the total number of members of this association is only over 500. Strictly regulating the qualifications of journalists is actually to enhance the credibility of our industry. (2) The qualification of journalists should be limited to those who take the news industry as their profession. Reporting current events and promoting public opinion not only requires specialized knowledge and skills, but also must be specialized, dedicated, and regard this as a battle, because the country values ​​journalists, and the people trust journalists, respect them as mentors, and rely on them as ears and eyes, because they can specialize in their work, dedicate themselves to service, abide by professional ethics, and maintain professional credibility, not something that can be filled by unqualified personnel. (3) The qualification of journalists should be uniform throughout the country and should not be slightly different. At this time when the general election is imminent, we should strictly guard against the abuse of false names, so as not to set a bad example for constitutional government and damage the dignity of the news industry. This association proposes that the government should promptly promulgate journalists' laws and that journalists' organizations in various places should abide by them uniformly. Those who fail to meet the standards will not be recognized by law, and public opinion across the country will impose sanctions on them. The above three points are the common views of the people of this association. We hope that the industry across the country will unanimously agree and that the government authorities will act quickly, so as to prevent the abuses of elections and set an example for constitutional government. The people of this association look forward to it very much. Capital Journalists Association, August 17th printed.</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Delegation Inspects the United States, Unanimous Welcome from American Government and Public, Scheduled to Visit Canada at the End of This Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, New York Special Correspondent Hangxun] The visit of the Chinese Legislative Yuan delegation to the United States this time has been highly valued by overseas Chinese and American officials and civilians alike. After arriving in Washington, D.C., on July 7, the delegation visited House Speaker Martin and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton on the 9th to discuss governance (Note: Martin is a presidential candidate, and Eaton is a Republican congressman with high qualifications). On the 10th, they visited Vincent, Director of the Far East Bureau of the State Department. On the 11th, they inspected the Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I.), which is perfectly equipped and highly efficient. On the 13th, they attended a welcoming meeting held by overseas Chinese. On the 14th, Ambassador Koo hosted a cocktail party at the embassy, inviting several members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, ambassadors to the U.S. from various countries, and leaders from the State Department, education, culture, and finance to meet with the three members of the delegation: Wu Shangying, Zhang Zhaoyuan, and Sheng Zhenwei, and discuss various topics for three hours. On the 15th, during Ambassador Koo's dinner party, they met with former French Prime Minister Herriot and the ambassadors to the U.S. from Belgium, Turkey, and other countries. On the 16th, the delegation visited the Library of Congress, the most comprehensive library in the world, and the State Department hosted a cocktail reception at Blair House, which is used to entertain visiting dignitaries. Many members of both houses of Congress and central government officials attended, and the newly appointed Director of the Far East Bureau of the U.S. State Department, White, also rushed to attend. At noon on the 21st, Au Shang, Zhang Zhaoyuan, Sheng Zhenwei, and their accompanying personnel, accompanied by Ambassador Koo, met with President Truman and discussed matters for fifteen minutes, and took a group photo in the President's office in the White House. At noon on the 22nd, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton and Congressman Fulton and others hosted a reception for the delegation in the House restaurant. Wu, Zhang, and Sheng, as well as their advisors and secretaries, attended. More than 30 Republican congressmen attended, and Eaton, Fulton, and female congressional aide Bolton delivered speeches welcoming the delegation. On the Chinese side, Ambassador Koo, Secretary-General Wu Shangying, and Chairman Zhang Zhaoyuan delivered replies, and both hosts and guests were pleased. On the 23rd, they dined with several Democratic senators in the Senate. At this time, both houses were meeting day and night to expedite the completion of all bills in order to adjourn on schedule on July 26. Therefore, members of both houses spared time to meet, expressing their high regard for the first visit of Chinese legislators to the United States. Wu, Zhang, and Sheng all graduated from renowned American universities and have been serving the country for 25 to 30 years. American officials and civilians are aware of this, so they are very respectful to the three men. In addition, Wu, Zhang, and Sheng either attended sessions in the Senate and House of Representatives, or went to the Library of Congress and the Central Printing and Publishing Bureau to study laws, or exchanged views with individual congressmen. The three men divided the work and cooperated. Wu Shangying focused on the rights and interests of overseas Chinese and improving their treatment, while Zhang Zhaoyuan focused on commercial laws and economic assistance to China, and also advocated for the United States to lend silver to China to improve the currency system. Sheng Zhenwei focused on law, education, and court organization, and all made considerable gains. For example, the treatment of overseas Chinese in the United States and Canada has recently undergone many revisions, and improvements are expected to be made in the near future. Since the implementation of Article 298 of our country's Company Law, the laws in the western states of the United States prohibiting overseas Chinese from purchasing real estate have been repealed one after another. The so-called principle of equality and reciprocity is gradually being implemented. The loan of silver to China has attracted the deep attention of the American government and public. Speaker Martin also said that it is worthy of deep consideration. This is the activity of the Legislative Yuan delegation in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>On July 27, the delegation went from Washington to New York, where Consul General Zhang and many overseas Chinese leaders welcomed them at the station. On the 29th, overseas Chinese held a meeting to welcome them. On the 31st, the Sino-American Chamber of Commerce held a round table meeting, attended by more than 20 of the chamber's chairmen and directors. The questions they raised were mostly focused on our country's Company Law, Banking Law, and the current difficult trade situation. Zhang Zhaoyuan and Wu Shangying, the drafters of our country's Company Law and Banking Law, respectively, answered and discussed for three and a half hours. The leaders of the Sino-American Chamber of Commerce all expressed their satisfaction and hoped that our country's Banking Law would be promulgated and the Insurance Law revised as soon as possible. On August 4, the delegation attended a session of the United Nations Security Council. On the 5th, they visited the famous Sing Ding Prison to study various facilities in detail and had lunch in the prison. On the 6th, Zhang and Sheng visited the Juvenile Court (which specializes in hearing cases involving male and female offenders aged 16 to 18). This type of court is not only unique to other countries, but also exists only in a few places in the United States. Its purpose is to prevent juveniles from mixing with adult prisoners to avoid them going astray. On the 8th, the two men again visited the Children's Court (which specializes in handling criminal cases involving boys and girls under the age of 16). Later, they went to the Family Court (which specializes in handling disputes over spousal support, and its nature is more inclined to investigation and mediation rather than divorce litigation). These are all things that our country has not yet established, and it is quite necessary to borrow from them. New York is the financial center of the United States. The members of the delegation have been busy visiting and inspecting for days, and exchanging views with business leaders. They are expected to travel to the capital of Canada after August 20 and have arranged to meet with Canadian Prime Minister King to exchange views on general legislative issues. After visiting Canada, the work in North America will come to an end, and then they will cross the Atlantic to the British Isles. To sum up the work of the delegation in the United States, the focus is on collecting information, striving for fair principles in our country's foreign-related legislation, explaining our country's laws to friendly countries so that they can understand them, and publicizing the reality of our country's preparations for constitutional government.

<h3>Weekly Forum Pay Attention to China's Southwestern Gateway - Kham and Tibet!</h3>
<p>— Hong Shibo</p>
<p>At present, Chinese people are all paying attention to the development of the China-North Burma incident, but they are not paying much attention to another aspect, China's southwestern gateway—Kham and Tibet. However, according to a report from the Kang-Tibetan Agency in Qamdo, "British Indian armed forces were discovered within the territory of Pomi in Kham, which is said to be because the chieftain of Pomi 'offered' Baimagang and other places to the British and came to negotiate acceptance with the Tibetan side." Pomi and Baimagang both belong to the four parts of Kham, adjacent to Tibet, bordering India to the south, and are inhabited by a mix of Qiang and Tibetan ethnic minorities. After the end of World War II, both China and Britain were among the five powers, but Britain's current actions are a bit strange. Isn't she always saying that she respects the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty? Xikang is our country's territory, so why did the British and Indian armed forces go to Pomi and Baimagang? Although they claim that the chieftain of Pomi "offered land" to the British, the chieftain of Pomi is a Chinese official and is under the command of the Chinese government. How could he offer land to the British? Because he does not have such power. Even if it is true, how could the Chinese government agree? Wouldn't that be suspected of alienating our nation? What is especially strange is that they are actually negotiating with the Tibetan side to take over the land! Tibet is a local administrative region in our country, although it is presided over by the Dalai and Panchen Lamas, it is still under the administration of our Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. If the British really want to "take over," they should negotiate directly with our government. How can they negotiate with the Tibetan side?</p>
<p>According to the location of Pomi and Baimagang, they are shown on most detailed maps. Their area is located between 29° and 31° north latitude and 94.5° and 97° east longitude, to the south of Suogong, Da'en, Baxoi, and Qamdo, in the southwest of eastern Kham, bordering the Assam province of India, at the great bend of the Yarlung Tsangpo River (one of the main streams of the Ganges, also known as R. of Brahmaputra), which flows into India and is called the Brahmaputra River (R. of Brahmaputra). It meets with the main stream of the Ganges northeast of Calcutta and flows into the Bay of Bengal (B. of Bengal), so Pomi and Baimagang are actually located in the upper reaches of the Ganges. Above, it guards Lhasa, below, it points to Jiaozhi, internally, it arches Kang and Yunnan, and externally, it defends India and Burma, a crucial strategic location. The people are mostly Khampa and Tsangpa Tibetans (Chang-pa &amp; Khang-pa), who speak the Kham language, North Assamese, or their own dialects, which belong to the Tibetan language family. The people are backward in knowledge, and education is not developed. The chieftain system still exists in the territory, with considerable authority. There are also a few British missionaries who enter Tibet from India to preach in the area. The territory is located in the Kang-Yunnan gorge area, between the Tibetan Plateau, with high mountains such as the Boshula Ridge, Anrili Mountain, and the Himalayas. At the bend of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, there is a small gorge basin, gradually expanding to the south, where wheat or highland barley can be grown. The people's lives are generally the same as in Tibet. High mountains and large rivers block the territory, making transportation very inconvenient. (This is in terms of our central government's management, but if you go north from the railway from Calcutta to Sadiya in India, you can directly reach our border; or if you enter Tibet from Yadong and transfer to Kham, it will be a bit farther, the difference in ease of travel for the host and guest is clear. Therefore, the British, taking advantage of their geographical advantage, have long had the idea of invading our border.) The territory is not very rich in products. The mountainous areas have lush forests, most of which have not been exploited. There are also many domestic animals, but there are no accurate statistics on mineral resources. Since occupying India, the British have annexed Sikkim, (Dranjong), Bhutan, and Nepal, removing all of our southwestern barriers, and then thinking of getting their hands on our Kham and Tibet. In the early years of the Republic, they used the Dalai Lama's pro-British sentiments to betray our country. After several negotiations, they finally acknowledged our continued suzerainty. In the sixth year of the Republic, the Tibetan lamas were fooled and launched an internal invasion, occupying more than a dozen counties in western Kham. Later, the British mediated, and the 16 counties in eastern Kham were governed by government troops, while the area west of Qamdo was temporarily occupied by Tibetan troops. In the sixteenth year of the Republic, the central government changed the Chuanbian Special Region to Xikang Province, and urgently sought a strategy for governing the border, but the provincial government has not yet been established. In the twenty-seventh year of the Republic, the government moved inland due to the Sino-Japanese Incident, and then划川西雅安·西昌·等 fifteen counties into Kang, before establishing the provincial government in Kangding, roughly forming a scale. However, its western part borders Tibet, and the provincial boundary has not yet been clearly demarcated. Ordinary maps generally use the Tanggula Mountain Pass to Wuding Mountain as the main line, but this is different from foreign-published maps. Foreign maps extend the eastern border of Tibet to near Zayu, including the chieftains of Pomi and Baimagang. Therefore, foreigners regard this area as within Tibetan territory. Although there is a provincial government in eastern Kham, it seems that Han and Yi people live together, and it is difficult to govern. Last year, the counties of Tianquan, Ya'an, and Rongjing had a war to suppress opium. Although it has been quelled, hidden worries cannot be ignored. The politics of western Kham are similar to those of Tibet. When there is an emergency on the Tibetan border, there is a risk of affecting the Kham border. Moreover, the chieftains are昏庸, their knowledge is浅陋, and they are easily fooled and exploited. Because the government is unable to reach them, even though it clearly hears about them, it can only sit back and watch its development, causing foreign troubles to arise one after another. As for the area along India in southern Kham, it is even more coveted by the British, because its terrain is appropriately located in the northern border of the Ganges plain in India, and it is more convenient than Tibet, and there are no high mountains blocking it (the Tibetan-Indian border has the natural barrier of the Himalayas). After the construction of the town road from Calcutta to Sadiya, it is easier to get involved, which shows that they have long been premeditating to covet our border. The famous British geographical society George Philip &amp; Son, LTD. had already劃入印度邊界 in its map published in 1936 (the border area is about fifty to seventy miles wide from west to Bhutan to the upper reaches of the Enmeikai River (R. or Nmai-kha)), planning to establish a North-East Frontier Province (this is what the author has seen, perhaps earlier maps were already like this), that is, until 1947, it has been ten years since then (maybe earlier), and we are ignorant of it.</p>
<p>In March and April of this year, there was an internal turmoil in Tibet. Originally, the political power of Tibet was in the hands of monks and nobles, most of the monks were pro-Han, and the lay people were pro-British. After the death of the 13th Dalai Lama, the leader of the pro-Han faction, Lazhen, the host of Sera Monastery, was elected as the Regent, but after taking office, he was not in harmony with the pro-British faction, so the dispute became very deep. Later, the pro-British faction gained power, and Lazhen was squeezed out. In the 32nd year of the Republic, Lazhen cooperated with Liu Wenhui, the chairman of Xikang Province, and launched the变 of Sera, Ganden, and Drepung monasteries, but the result could not reverse the decline. Recently, the Regent of Tibet, Dazha, is about to resign due to old age, and Lazhen has a tendency to make a comeback. The pro-British faction struck first and arrested Lazhen, sentencing him for treason. Especially Lhalu had a feud with Lazhen for killing his father, and Liang was jealous, so he took revenge in mid-March, gouging out Lazhen's eyes. In mid-April, he was secretly executed. The three major monasteries were dissatisfied and rebelled, resulting in this internal turmoil. Although it has now been quelled, there is still a possibility of recurrence at any time. According to news, the reason why Lhalu and others dared to do this is because there is a certain background relationship behind them. Although the pro-British faction is like this, it is still afraid that Liu Wenhui will lead troops into Tibet, so the Tibetan army has built fortifications on the border between Kham and Tibet and near the Nujiang River, actively increasing defenses, which shows their fear of the central government.</p>
<p>Our country's border connected to the longest one, besides the Soviet Union, is India. However, our country has always used a政策 policy in the southwestern border, and does not think about实边图防. Although the situation is slightly better than in the past, due to different ethnic groups, remote land, blocked transportation, unsuitable climate, and the lack of active border policy, the incompetence of border affairs ministers, and restricted by other various environments, there is still no proper solution. If the strength allows in the future, we should first set up the Sichuan-Tibet Railway from Chengdu through Kangding, Bamo, Qamdo, Suogong, and Taizhao to Lhasa or Shigatse, connecting with the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. Not only can the local products of the southwest such as wool, antelope horn, musk, deer antler, rhinoceros horn, placer gold, and petroleum be exchanged for the products of the Yangtze River basin, but the significance in terms of governance and military affairs is especially important. Therefore, after the completion of the Trans-China Railway, Kham and Tibet can directly depend on the central government, which is more convenient for command. Build highways in secondary places. Then instill education, open up the people's minds, improve the land, increase production, integrate ethnic groups, eliminate barriers, actively build, and make things progress together. Of course, there are many other conditions, abolish the current land system, re-divide the counties, set up provincial governments, and make the administrative system completely the same as the inland, so that it is directly governed by the central government. The effect of governing will definitely be more convenient than it is now.</p>
<p>Since the Pomi incident has developed to this point, I hope that our government should not only lodge a strong protest with the British government and order its troops to withdraw beyond our country's borders, but also strengthen our borders and give them a military counterattack. In addition, we can also collect evidence and appeal to the United Nations Security Council when necessary, in order to obtain a fair judgment.</p>

<h3>Joint Meeting of Two Dominions Discusses Indian Defense Issues Decides to Strengthen Security Forces in Ben-Cheb Province</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 17th] Following two days of jubilant celebrations, the Indian Union and Pakistan have today begun to address national affairs, with defense being their first priority. The Joint Defense Council of the Indian Union and Pakistan, chaired by Mountbatten, began considering the security policies of the two dominions in New Delhi today. The council members include the Governor-General of Pakistan, Jinnah, the Supreme Commander of India, Marshal Auchinleck, and the Defense Ministers of both dominions. However, Jinnah did not attend and was represented by Prime Minister Ali Khan. The main issue facing the Joint Defense Council is the defense of the Northwest Frontier Province, known as the "Gateway to India." The Northwest Frontier Province belongs to Pakistan. In addition, the Bolan Pass, which connects Balochistan to the Indian plains, and the Sylhet district of Assam, which overlooks the Ganges River, are also within Pakistan's territory. Therefore, Pakistan plays a significant role in the land defense of the Indian peninsula. The Indian Union has a long coastline, so it bears a heavier responsibility for maritime defense. Mountbatten is scheduled to leave New Delhi for Mumbai today to bid farewell to the first batch of British troops withdrawing from India. [United Press, New Delhi, 16th] The Joint Defense Council of the two Indian dominions decided today to strengthen the security forces in Ben-Cheb Province to curb the state of anarchy in the province. It is reported that the recent conflicts between the Indian and Muslim communities in Ben-Cheb Province have been very intense. The council's decision was announced one day earlier than the report of the Indian-Muslim Boundary Commission for Ben-Cheb and Bengal provinces. Responsible persons said that the report of the Boundary Commission might cause more violent riots.</p>

<h3>Greek Guerrilla Leader Officially Announces Establishment of "Free Greek Provisional Government" Guerrilla Radio Station Located in the Capital of Albania</h3>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 16th] Greek guerrilla leader General Vafiadis announced today via radio the establishment of a "Free Greek Provisional Government." According to a spokesman for the Greek government army headquarters, the guerrilla radio station is located in the capital of Albania. At the same time, the Third Army Command in Thessaloniki announced that guerrilla activity had intensified in more than ten locations from western Thrace to western Macedonia in the past forty-eight hours, using heavy artillery that the government army does not have to attack. The Greek constabulary also seized many printed copies of the guerrilla government's declaration of establishment, and the prosecutor is about to file a public prosecution. However, the official side is not surprised, believing that the guerrillas had already announced the establishment of a provisional government. This move is sufficient to provide the government army with an offensive target, which is particularly beneficial to the government army, which has always failed to induce the guerrillas to engage in a direct battle.</p>
<h3>Responding to Attlee's First Prime Ministerial Appeal Churchill Broadcast Speech Accuses the Labour Government of Mismanagement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 16th] Opposition leader Churchill delivered a broadcast speech from his residence today to respond to Prime Minister Attlee's broadcast appeal to the nation last Sunday.

He believed that only by allowing individual effort, free enterprise and the use of talents, maintaining individual risk-taking, and unequal prices and rewards, with competition as the basis for selection, could forty-seven million people survive. Churchill denounced Prime Minister Attlee's announced restoration of certain wartime coercive systems, believing that he himself, as well as conservatives, free-thinking conservatives, liberals and socialists, could not recognize them as part of Britain's peacetime plan.</p>

<h3>"God Created Man, I Created Cities" Summary of the International Municipal Federation</h3>
<p>—Kong Qiuquan from Paris—</p>
<p>Mr. Gu Bapo said: "God created man, and man created cities." For thousands of years, cities have been the source of civilization and history, and under the capitalist economic system, cities are the most concentrated places for economy, politics, talent, and technology. However, after the cruel destruction of war, the heart and shell of the city have obviously become increasingly desolate. In order to engage in restoration and reconstruction, the International Municipal Federation recently held its 7th annual meeting in Paris, France.</p>
<p>In addition to China, the countries attending this meeting also included the United States, France, Britain, the Netherlands, Canada, South Africa, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cuba, Ecuador, Italy, Hungary, Luxembourg, Norway, Brazil, Poland, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, and French Tunisia. Turkey, etc., a total of 26 countries, the number of people attending each country varies, with many as many as dozens. Such as the United Kingdom and France, because important cities in these two countries have representatives to participate. On the Chinese side, it was reported that Xi Yushu, Huang Boqiao, and Qian Tai, the standing directors of the Chinese Municipal Association and the president and vice president of the Shanghai branch, were appointed as representatives, but because Xi and Huang could not come, and Ambassador Qian was ordered to participate in the International Food Conference held at the same time in Paris, so as a result, Jiang Xiqu was asked to participate as a representative. The meeting opened on the anniversary of China's War of Resistance Against Japan (July 7) and closed on the 12th. The discussion was very enthusiastic during the week. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Agenda and Discussion</p>
<p>According to the original agenda of the International Municipal Federation, the following four topics should be discussed by the group committee: (1) local autonomy; (2) public education (3) urban reconstruction; (4) expansion of the International Municipal Federation's organization. Later, due to difficulties in group discussions, it was decided to change to a general discussion. August 9th and 11th were for the attending representatives to report on the current situation of their respective cities on the three issues of local autonomy, public education, and urban reconstruction. On the morning of the 12th, a comprehensive conclusion was made based on the discussions of the previous three days. (1) "Local Autonomy" The current freedom of local governments in most countries is less than before the war due to the impact of wartime central government control. Also, due to local financial difficulties, there are many places where the central government needs to provide assistance, which makes the freedom of local governments more restricted. The best solution is that the central government should issue subsidies based on the financial needs of various places, and then the local governments should handle them themselves. (2) "Public Education" should be the responsibility of the local government, but it should not have political implications. The construction of urban housing is also related to the education of children. If the construction of housing can free mothers from having to devote all their energy to managing labor, then most of their time can be used to pay attention to the education of their children. (3) "Urban Reconstruction" It is hoped that countries participating in the International Municipal Federation can submit the following to the Municipal Federation: 1. estimates and data of buildings destroyed by war and enemies; 2. laws and land legislation related to local reconstruction; 3. budget data for local reconstruction, and I hope that the municipal organizations of various countries will pay special attention to the suggestions of the International Municipal Federation. On the afternoon of the 12th, the expansion of the International Municipal Federation's organization, the date and location of the next meeting, and other issues were discussed.</p>
<p>Date and Location of the Next Meeting</p>
<p>Expansion of the International Municipal Federation's organization and the date, location, and agenda of the next meeting.</p>
<p>(A) "Establishment of a Standing Bureau" It was decided to establish a standing bureau, and each member state should send two to three representatives to participate. Each representative should pay an annual membership fee of 1,200 Swiss francs (approximately US$300). The first plenary meeting of the Standing Bureau will be held between September and October of this year. All countries should promptly notify the Federation of the names of the municipal organizations that have joined the Federation and the names of the representatives participating in the Standing Bureau (the number of representatives participating in the Standing Bureau is based on the country). This matter is still the responsibility of the groups participating in this meeting. (B) Next Meeting (1) There will be meetings in both 1948 and 1949, but the Standing Bureau will decide which year will be the general meeting and which year will be the regular meeting.</p>
<p>(3) There were three proposals for the meeting location: the Czech Republic, Geneva, and Canada. The Standing Bureau will decide the location of the two meetings in 1948 and 1949. (3) The agenda for the next meeting should include: 1. Local Finance; 2. The scope of local economic activities; 3. Revision of various articles of association of the Federation;</p>
<p>The chairman and secretary-general of the conference were Haris, the president of the International Municipal Federation, and Wen Neike, the secretary-general, respectively. The damage to our country's cities after the war and the general construction plan were also submitted to the meeting, which was highly valued by the representatives of various countries. When the president of the conference, Mr. Haris, met with the representatives of this association, he praised the far-reaching ideals of the Great Shanghai Plan.</p>

<h3>Five Seafarer Groups Oppose Lowering Treatment to the Municipal Government Tomorrow to Petition Under Negotiation Express Government is Not Guaranteed Will Change Profession</h3>
<p>The Chinese Merchant Ship Captains Association, the Chinese Marine Engineers Association, the Chinese Ship Radio Officers Association, and the Chinese Navigation Officers United Association and other five category A seafarer groups held a joint meeting yesterday, attended by Jin Yueshi, Lu Liangbing, Jiang Keni and other more than 20 people. Lu Liangbing was publicly elected as the chairman to discuss how to deal with the recent proposal by a certain shipping company to reduce the treatment of crew members. After deliberation, it was unanimously and resolutely opposed, a declaration was drafted to appeal to all sectors of society, and it was decided to collectively petition Mayor Wu on the morning of the 19th and negotiate with the National Federation of Trade Unions. The content of the petition and negotiation: (1) It is heard that some shipping companies are planning to reduce the treatment of crew members, (2) The life of crew members is monotonous and it is a dangerous occupation, so their treatment is universally preferential, (3) The treatment of crew members was resolved in July by the association and other shipping companies after the lifting of the cost of living index, and it is believed that the crew members have made great concessions, (4) The shipping company has obtained the approval of the government to negotiate prices on its own, and has repeatedly increased prices, and the current pricing has exceeded 100,000 times before the war, while the treatment of crew members, taking August as an example, is only more than 20,000 times, based on this comparison, it is unreasonable, how can it be reduced again, (5) Request a guarantee that it can only be increased and not reduced. If the government does not guarantee it, all category A crew members will inevitably abandon the difficult and seek the easy and change to other professions, (6) Request the government to severely punish the shipping company that proposes to reduce the treatment of crew members, (7) In order to maintain the Chinese shipping industry, they will not hesitate to make any sacrifices and vow to oppose the scum in the shipping company. It is heard that the association and others have jointly issued a notice to summon all members of the ship in Shanghai to participate in the petition to the municipal government.</p>
<h3>Central Meteorological Bureau Director Lu Jiong Scheduled to Go to the United States Lamented the Difficulty of Talented Technical Personnel</h3>
<p>Lu Jiong, director of the Central Meteorological Bureau, came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago and is scheduled to go abroad to Washington on the 20th to attend the International Meteorological Conference. Lu is a famous meteorologist in China. In addition to working at the Meteorological Bureau, he also teaches at Central and Zhejiang Universities. Last year, Lu was ordered to go abroad to attend the first post-war International Meteorological Conference and was elected as one of the seven executive members of the International Meteorological Organization. He also served as a member of the Ocean Meteorological Special Committee of the organization. This trip to the United States is to attend as China's chief plenipotentiary representative.</p>
<p>A Total of Eighty-Nine Meteorological Stations Directly Under the Jurisdiction</p>
<p>The reporter visited Director Lu yesterday and inquired about the general weather conditions in China. It is said that there are a total of 89 meteorological stations directly under the Central Meteorological Bureau, distributed in major cities across the country. In addition, meteorological stations have also been established in various provinces and cities, and the expenses are borne individually by each province and city, and the personnel used are under the jurisdiction of the Meteorological Bureau. The difficulty previously felt by the Meteorological Bureau was the shortage of funds and the lack of technical personnel. The former difficulty has been slightly resolved with the large-scale withdrawal of American instruments to China, while the latter cannot be resolved in a short time. Because among the science colleges of various universities across the country, only Central University and Tsinghua University have meteorology departments, but the number of graduates each year is very small. For example, this year the Meteorological Bureau and the Meteorological Office of the Air Force Command need more than 200 technical personnel, while only two people graduated from Central University. How to allocate them? Although the Central Government has established a meteorological training class, the graduates can only take on ordinary technical work. Therefore, although the Meteorological Bureau has the determination to expand, it has not been able to achieve its wishes due to the inability to recruit talents. Director Lu hopes that various universities across the country can add more meteorology departments, and hopes that young students will study this interesting meteorology, so as to create a new road for China's meteorological community in the future.</p>
<h3>Dance Industry Holds Symposium Xin Chen Visits Mayor Wu</h3>

The industry also decided to send representatives to visit Mayor Wu at the municipal government at 11 am this morning</p>
<h3>Reconstruction of Wuzhen Road Overseas Chinese Bridge Funding of 150 Million</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In order to connect the traffic between Zhabei and Huxi, the Public Works Bureau plans to rebuild Wuzhen Road Bridge, which has been approved by the municipal government.

<h3>Train Thief Party Chief Arrested Could Not Stand Fatigue Interrogation Leading to the Arrest of Three Accomplices</h3>
<p>Recently, jumping train theft cases have occurred frequently along the two lines, and the Road Bureau Police Department attaches great importance to it. On the 15th of this month, Director Wang ordered Criminal Police Team Detective Chief Kang Yimin, Detective Police Chief Zhang Yingjun, and Detective Police Liu Zuomin to go to Wuxi to investigate secretly. At 2:30 am on the 16th, Detective Chief Kang saw a young man in a blue cloth shirt and suspicious behavior on the platform of Xishi Station. Just as the 9th express train from Beijing to Shanghai arrived at Xishi, the young man boarded the train, and Kang and Detective Chief Zhang followed and monitored him.</p>
<p>Caught Off Guard Jumped Train to Escape</p>
<p>When the train left Xishi Station and the passengers were asleep, the young man suddenly stood up, first smoked a cigarette, and then left his seat to grope on the luggage rack, stealing a net bag containing 1.65 million yuan in legal tender and books and clothes (belonging to Yang Tongyuan, who came to Shanghai to take the Jiao Tong University entrance examination). After succeeding, he walked out of the carriage with big strides and a very generous attitude. At this point, Detective Chief Kang and Detective Police Chief Zhang, who were hiding in the dark, followed out. At this time, the criminal had reached the intersection of carriages 820 and 942, and was hugged by Police Chief Zhang. Unexpectedly, the criminal bit Zhang's left arm hard, causing Zhang to fall to the ground in extreme pain. In a flash, the criminal had already jumped onto the roof of the car, near Wangting Station, carrying the original stolen goods on the passenger car as it flew. He jumped off the carriage and escaped without a trace</p>
<p>False Report of Robbery Surrendered Himself</p>
<p>When the train arrived at Suzhou Station, Detective Chief Kang telegraphed Wangting Police Station in detail, describing the criminal's appearance and the location of the jump, and asked the police to assist in the pursuit. After receiving the report, the station was about to send someone to pursue, when suddenly a young man in a blue cloth shirt with a bloody face went to report the loss, saying that he had been robbed on the 9th train and pushed off the train by bandits. The police station thought that the clothes worn by the young man were the same as those reported by Detective Chief Kang, so they pretended to agree and immediately telegraphed Detective Chief Kang in Suzhou secretly and asked him to go to Wangting as soon as possible. Kang rushed to Wangting with Police Chief Zhang by train after receiving the report. After a secret identification, it was indeed the escaped criminal who jumped off the train, and he was immediately detained</p>
<p>Fatigue Interrogation Confessed Accomplices</p>
<p>After the criminal was arrested, he was taken to Xishi for medical treatment due to his facial injuries. After bandaging, he was escorted back to the First Section of the Xishihu Police Section. Section Chief Min Jian was selected to interrogate him using fatigue interrogation methods. The criminal then confessed that his name was Zhang Bingren, 26 years old, from Jinan, Shandong. He was the main culprit of the famous "Bengbu Gang Flying Car Party". There were a total of eight accomplices. Later, because there were no more passengers traveling to and from the Bengbu area, they went south at the end of last year and entrenched themselves in the Suxi area, specializing in stealing on night express trains. They had committed hundreds of cases. Later, the criminal was escorted to the station again, and he pointed out accomplices Yuan Liangxiao (27 years old, from Guangdong), Huang Ying (23 years old, from Guangdong), and Wang Mouhua (25 years old, from Guilin) on the spot, and they were arrested and brought back to the section. They all directly admitted to stealing by flying cars together. As for the three remaining accomplices, they had fled after hearing the news. The arrested criminals were escorted by Detective Chief Kang, and arrived in Shanghai from Xishi yesterday afternoon. The fugitives</p>
<p>Public Performance Jumping Car Stunt</p>
<p>After the four criminals arrived in Shanghai, the Police Department ordered the main criminal Zhang Bingren to publicly perform the jumping car stunt, and awarded him a package and a box. The criminal climbed onto the car as light as a swallow, and after boarding the car, his movements were as agile as a monkey. When he flipped from the carriage to the roof of the car and jumped off the roof of the car, he was safe and sound. The jumping and climbing skills are extremely skilled. The criminals will be sent to the court for strict handling after further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Nanhui Bloodshed: Tax Collection Official and Village Headman Murdered in the Night; Another Abducted and Missing</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At approximately 2:00 AM on the 16th, more than ten bandits suddenly descended upon the home of Jin Wenxiang (age 50, currently a tax collection official for the Nanhui County government) in Xujinjia Bridge, Dongli, Xinchang Town, Nanhui County, Pudong.

In addition to visiting leaders of various Jiangsu communities in Shanghai, he returned to Zhenjiang by train last night. A reporter interviewed him to inquire about his impressions. He expressed high praise and admiration for some members of the Jiangsu community and the press in Shanghai, saying that the disaster victims in Northern Jiangsu will never forget their enthusiasm and efforts. Through consultations over the past three days, the expected amount of relief funds will reach 25 billion yuan. The UNRRA also has 1,500 tons of grain that may be transported to the disaster area for work relief, exceeding their original hopes. Wang also said that the strength of the Chinese people is truly incredibly great. Although Shanghai is the financial center of the country, all kinds of fundraising activities are aimed at Shanghai. Over the years, Shanghai has contributed greatly to society and the nation. Even regarding the disaster relief in Northern Jiangsu, this is the third time raising funds in Shanghai. Within a few days, the amount has exceeded the original target. The future of Jiangsu and the nation is truly optimistic. Wang and others will likely return to Shanghai in a few days to formally establish an organization with all parties, first borrowing 10 billion yuan from the four banks to send personnel to Northern Jiangsu for emergency relief. Wang repeatedly expressed his willingness to represent the 10 million disaster victims in Northern Jiangsu to express their deep gratitude to all sectors of Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Jiangwan Stadium: Visiting the New Recruit Camp; Wearing Lively and Agile Grass-Green Military Uniforms; Knowledge Level is Uniform but Lacking Spiritual Nourishment</h3>
<p>To make the new, democratic, and free China stand tall at the pinnacle of the world and to lay the foundation for survival and freedom, national defense, and preventing external threats that have not subsided, and eliminating internal chaos, it is necessary to first establish a strong military. All young people with ambition and passion should generously and enthusiastically enlist in the military and fulfill their national obligations. As the saying goes, "A good man should be a soldier!"</p>
<p>In a corner of Jiangwan Road, in a sports field covering hundreds of acres, thousands of strong men who have traveled long distances from afar - the new recruits - are active. On their healthy and strong bodies, we can recognize the soul of the Chinese nation, which is kind, strong, unyielding, and resilient new life.</p>
<p>Visiting New Recruits Amidst the Heat</p>
<p>When the reporter arrived at Jiangwan Stadium, he saw groups of new recruits wearing neat, grass-green military uniforms, looking so energetic and solemn as they awaited orders from the commanding officers to arrange their new lodgings, or peacefully sitting and waiting for the doctors to give them vaccinations. It was all so natural and joyful. Cars arrived one after another. Party Secretary Fang, Assembly Speaker Pan, and Secretary-General Xie Renzhao personally braved the scorching sun to inspect the site and慰勞 (extend comfort/welfare) to the new recruits.</p>
<p>Port Commander General Shi Zhaoheng told reporters in a calm tone about the number of new recruits transiting through and their distribution, saying, "In the past, they were distributed in twelve locations, including Longhua, Nanshi, and Wusong. Originally, because they were going to be transported by sea to the Northeast for centralized training, there was no unified plan. But now, due to insufficient ship transport, in order to facilitate management, it was decided to use this ruin, clean it up, and use it as a resting camp for the new recruits passing through Shanghai, both north and south. At the same time, Chairman Chiang is extremely concerned about the food and lodging issues of the new recruits. Last time, he ordered Director Xu Siping to come to Shanghai to explain everything. The Joint Logistics Department has already transported 500 tents and 10,000 cots. It is expected that this place will be able to accommodate all the new recruits passing through Shanghai within days."</p>
<p>Bringing Warmth and Comfort</p>
<p>Because the new recruits did not have normal routines along the way, gastroenteritis is the most common ailment, followed by dysentery, malaria, and the flu. There is a fear of infectious diseases, so most of the new recruits entering the camp have been vaccinated against infectious diseases such as cholera. Most fascinating are the clean-up workers in red uniforms, the nurses in white uniforms, and the new recruits in green military uniforms, creating a red and white interspersed masterpiece. In order to provide a quiet opportunity for sick soldiers to recuperate, the former swimming pool will be used as a sanatorium and isolation ward. Efforts are currently being strengthened in environmental sanitation and disease prevention.</p>
<p>The drinking water problem has now been improved. After the tap water pipes are connected, showers and laundry sinks will be opened. Electrical wiring is about to be completed, which will soon bring the light and heat of the city to this place.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan went to visit every tent and the new recruits' lodging in the scorching sun. He happened to encounter them eating on the spot with a map. The food consisted mainly of pork, onions, peppers, and vegetables. Secretary Fang also ate a portion of rice and vegetables next to them. Because he is from Anhui, he made a special trip to the Anhui contingent to visit his fellow villagers, talking about their shared hometown. Every new recruit felt a sense of kinship. It is said that in terms of comfort/welfare activities, in order to enable the new recruits to receive the warmth and comfort of their fellow villagers, various hometown associations have been mobilized to launch comfort/welfare gatherings. Currently, Hunan, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Guangxi have initiated responses.</p>
<p>Hoping to Read Newspapers and Magazines</p>
<p>I remember grabbing a small boy named Yao Lizhi, only nineteen years old, with a small stature, from the new recruits with lightning speed and asked him if he had been forced to enlist or if there were other reasons for joining. He opened his big eyes, naturally revealing a mouthful of white teeth, and crying, replied in a Hunan dialect very correctly and humorously, "I am not young anymore. Of course I can enlist in the army. Can't I voluntarily do my part for the country?" The reporter was touched by his sense of justice and almost burst into tears, and could not help but reach out and shake his hand tightly.</p>
<p>According to one of the officers in charge, "The level of knowledge among the new recruits is quite uniform. What they lack is spiritual nourishment. They hope to be able to read local newspapers and magazines." Regarding this, it is reported that the comfort/welfare committee and the comfort/welfare group have a whole plan for military culture. Secretary Fang said, "In the near future, loudspeakers and radio equipment will be installed on both sides of the open space to broadcast comfort/welfare programs. The existing movie theater in the sports field will be used to host performances by the city's theater guild every day, including spoken dramas, Peking opera, Yangzhou opera, Cantonese opera, Yue opera, and other programs."</p>
<p>In the twilight, in the hot current of the new recruits' magnificent singing, and in the passionate exchange of emotions, we left the "oasis" in the new recruits' journey. (Li Zige)</p>
<h3>Engineering Expert Dr. Mao Yisheng Broadcasts on the Huangpu River Crossing Project; The River Crossing Project is the Lifeline for the Prosperity of Pudong; Citizens Should Unite to Complete the Great Construction</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] This newspaper held its 20th special Sunday broadcast yesterday at the Jindu Radio Station, inviting engineering expert Dr. Mao Yisheng to broadcast on the "Huangpu River Crossing Project." The following is a summary of his speech:</p>
<p>The development of Shanghai started from the east bank of the Huangpu River (i.e., the Bund) and gradually spread westward for more than ten kilometers, while also developing upwards into the high-rise buildings along the Bund. However, the east bank of the Huangpu River, only five hundred meters away from the Bund, has remained completely still, maintaining its state from a hundred years ago. The disparity across the river is so great. What is the reason for this? The reason is very clear: it is due to the concessions. The west side of the Huangpu River had concessions, so it prospered. The east side of the Huangpu River had no concessions, so it declined. This is indeed a tragic historical fact. Although Shanghai ranks sixth among the world's major cities on the surface, it inevitably diminishes its luster.</p>
<p>Tunnels are the Most Reasonable, but the Cost is Enormous</p>
<p>Fortunately, after the victory, the Shanghai municipal authorities immediately thought of developing Pudong after taking over Shanghai and established the Shanghai River Crossing Project Committee to study and promote the plan for this river crossing project. Now, I will briefly report on the results of this study.</p>
<p>The term "river crossing project" originated from the River Crossing Project Committee. It refers to projects that cross the Huangpu River. Such projects can be bridges in the air, floating bridges made of boats on the water surface, or tunnels underground. All of these are technically feasible. With this river crossing project, Pudong will gradually become as prosperous as Puxi. Isn't this river crossing project the lifeline of Pudong, just as the Huangpu River is the lifeline of Shanghai?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these two lifelines have some conflicts. The river crossing project needs to cross the Huangpu River, and the Huangpu River is constantly busy with ships of all sizes day and night. If this river crossing project hinders the water traffic on the Huangpu River, then Pudong will not benefit, and Shanghai will suffer first! Therefore, the plan for this river crossing project must prioritize maintaining water traffic on the Huangpu River, and floating bridges made of boats on the water surface are not worth considering. This leads to the study of the advantages and disadvantages of tunnels and bridges. Tunnels are the most ideal river crossing projects, but the construction costs are extremely high. At today's prices, building a two-lane tunnel with a 4% grade would probably cost as much as 500 billion yuan.</p>
<p>High Bridges are Difficult to Realize, Low Bridges are a Compromise</p>
<p>As for bridges, there are high bridges and low bridges. High bridges are designed to allow the largest ships to pass under the bridge, which means that there must be a clearance of more than one hundred feet above the water surface. The construction cost of the bridge itself is considerable, but the most difficult thing is that such a high bridge requires extremely long bridge approaches to reach from the ground. Assuming that this high bridge crosses the river from the Bund of Zhongzheng Road, then the starting point of the bridge approach would almost need to extend to the Great World. Only then can all vehicles safely get on the bridge. Such a long bridge approach not only costs a lot to build and affects the surrounding real estate, but also requires going from the Bund back to the Great World to get on the bridge, which is a waste of time. Therefore, high bridges on the Huangpu River are also difficult to realize. As for low bridges, they are a compromise. When large ships pass under the bridge, a section of the bridge can be opened, changing from a horizontal position to a vertical position, leaving a section of waterway for the ships to pass through. Opening and closing this movable bridge only takes one and a half minutes each time, which is certainly inconvenient for vehicular traffic on the bridge, but it does not require very long bridge approaches, so the construction cost is much lower than high bridges and also cheaper than tunnels. Comparing the prices of the same period, it only accounts for a quarter of the construction cost of tunnels.</p>
<p>How to Raise Funds</p>
<p>Several Questions Arise</p>
<p>The above-mentioned three types of river crossing projects—tunnels, high bridges, and low bridges—each have their technical difficulties, but all are feasible. Economically, how to raise funds? It should be possible to raise funds from two sources: toll fees and land appreciation fees. However, there are several prerequisites: (1) Currently, there is ferry traffic across the Huangpu River. When will the ferry become strained and insufficient to meet the needs of crossing the river, prompting the realization of the river crossing project? (2) Currently, Pudong has not yet been developed. The biggest reason for this is the economic imbalance in the country. When will everyone come to Pudong to build? If Pudong is not developed, can the transportation across the river still increase? (3) In modern cities, the construction of bridges and tunnels is a productive undertaking and never relies on government subsidies. However, if Shanghai launches this river crossing project and issues bonds, how will Shanghai citizens trust it? Can it be compared to other international cities? How many people are willing to invest in such bonds instead of buying gold and US dollars? (4) The river crossing project is a part of the overall urban plan of Greater Shanghai. In order to realize the river crossing project, other related plans must also proceed to the same extent so that they can coordinate with each other. Otherwise, even if there is a river crossing project, but Pudong has not been developed at the same time, wouldn't this project be a losing business?</p>
<p>If the Plan is Realized, it Will be an Honor for Every Citizen</p>
<p>Judging from this, it seems that the Huangpu River crossing project does not have much hope at present. But Shanghai has more than five million citizens and is one of the six largest cities in the world. Among all the urban plans of Greater Shanghai, this river crossing project is the greatest and most arduous construction. If the citizens of Shanghai can unite to shoulder this great construction, starting with the most difficult, and serve as a model for urban construction in the country, one day when the citizens of Shanghai can leisurely walk across the Huangpu River, the past history of Shanghai will become the glory of every citizen!</p>
<h3>Special Broadcast Program</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] This newspaper held a special all-day Sunday broadcast yesterday at the Jindu Radio Station. In addition to inviting engineering expert Dr. Mao Yisheng to broadcast on the "Huangpu River Crossing Project," the full-day program is listed below: Starting at 9:00 AM, Dr. Zhong Zhihe spoke on "The Rampancy of Autumn Cholera," Zhao Mingsu spoke on "Great Love," the Lele Friendship Society sang songs, and Chen Fanwo spoke on "Women's Clothing and Food During Pregnancy." In the afternoon, Wang Qinglong performed a harmonica solo, Miss Bao Hanying told children's stories, Lawyer Mi Xitong spoke on "First Instance Litigation Procedures," and Dr. Wang Juerong spoke on "The Prevention and Treatment of痧子 (a type of skin disease)." From 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM, all members of the Xianni Society broadcast and sang five excerpts from famous Kunqu operas, including "Recognizing the Son," "Going to the Meeting Alone," "Red Maid Sending a Letter," and "Going Down the Mountain." The society is the main base of Kunqu opera in Shanghai, and their singing is naturally extraordinary. Therefore, during the broadcast, listeners from other provinces made long-distance calls to request Zhu Mingjun to sing "Touring the Garden." In order to respond to this kind request, we specially invited Zhu to sing the song again. From 9:00 PM to 12:00 AM, we specially invited teachers and students from the Xiasheng Drama School to broadcast and sing Peking opera, including "Fishing and Killing the Family" performed by young students from the school: Hu Shunxing, 罷通明 (name unknown), Zhang Xinde, Lin Xumin, Liu Zhaobo, Liu Zhaoxin, and Gan Zhenyang. Guo Jianying (school director), and students Liu Zhifa and Zhao Tingyuan performed "Imperial Concubine Assassinating the Tiger." Liu Zhongqiu (principal) and Ma Zhenkui (professor) performed "Beating the Stick and Leaving the Box." The school was established in Xi'an in July of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938) and has performed many times in Chengdu, Chongqing, and other places. After the victory, when the government returned to the capital, it traveled east along the Yangtze River, performing in major cities and receiving praise everywhere. In the 36th year of the Republic of China (1947), it moved to Shanghai and gave a short performance at the China Grand Theater, which was very well received. This time, at the invitation of this newspaper, all the teachers and students came out to broadcast excellent plays, and their enthusiasm is especially commendable.</p>
<h3>Dispute on the Tram Causes Traffic Obstruction on the Bund</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At 11:45 AM yesterday morning, two soldiers boarded a tram on the British Route 2 as it passed through the Bund of Nanjing Road. A misunderstanding occurred with the conductor, leading to a conflict. Eventually, the two sides resorted to violence, resulting in minor injuries. At that time, trams were connected on the way, causing traffic obstruction. The police station and the Tram Company Industry Union dispatched personnel to the scene to mediate. The injured soldiers were sent to the hospital, and the tram resumed operation at 1:30 PM in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>Savage Skies, Brave Warriors Endure Peril: American Investigation Deep into Valleys, Searching for Lost Loyal Bones and Wreckage</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent Zhou Xueduan, Chengdu, 12th] One recalls that during the most difficult phase of the War of Resistance, a great miracle - the Sino-American cooperation in flying the Hump - created a new lifeline for China at the time, laying the foundation for the final victory. In order to fly the Hump, countless loyal souls were buried in foreign cities and among chaotic mountains and countless peaks. After the victory, the American government also repeatedly sent teams to scout and search for loyal bones in foreign cities. Each time they went deep into barbarian areas, it was full of adventure. This is a piece of adventure history that a reporter obtained from a brave warrior who recently returned with the American army from a perilous journey.</p>
<p>Amidst Chaotic Mountains</p>
<p>Where Heroes' Bones Rest</p>
<p>In 1944, to accomplish the great feat of flying the Hump, countless loyal remains were shattered in India, the Himalayas, and the chaotic mountains of Sichuan, Kang, and Tibet. After the victory, the American government repeatedly sent teams into the mountains to search for loyal bones and wreckage, but without success. This May, after a long period of research, the American military authorities determined that possibly nine aircraft had crashed within the borders of Sichuan and Kang. Based on research of the areas through which the flight routes passed at the time, they dispatched Lieutenant Hangerland to lead a team to Sichuan to investigate. In late May, Lieutenant Han arrived in Chengdu and requested assistance from the Sichuan provincial authorities. The Sichuan-Kang Pacification Headquarters sent Adjutant Li Changjie, a translator, to accompany them and travel to Maogong via Xikang to search.</p>
<p>Peril in Deep Mountains</p>
<p>Ambushed by Bandits</p>
<p>In early June, this investigation team began its arduous journey, climbing mountains and crossing ridges, step by step delving into barbarian regions. In the border area between Sichuan and Kang, all are "barren lands" inhabited by both Han and Yi peoples. High mountains rise abruptly, chaotic currents run rampant, cliffs are tens of thousands of feet high, and precipices are a thousand *jian* high. The majority of the people are semi-civilized Lolo, Qiang, and Mosuo peoples, and a small number are stubborn Han Chinese. This is the "outer realm" of Sichuan and Kang, and also a paradise for a few adventurers - and a forbidden zone for those who traffic in and cultivate opium. In deep mountain valleys or on vast grasslands, *huanfu* often lurk, and bandits appear and disappear. They searched exhaustively in these high mountains, steep ridges, deep forests, and secluded valleys for more than a month, enduring all kinds of hardships. On July 19, they arrived in the forests of Dabao Mountain between Ganba and Kangding in Kang province, when suddenly a large number of bandits armed with guns and single-edged weapons ambushed them, and a fierce encounter battle unfolded on the spot. However, because the bandits were numerous and their guns were sharp, and the investigation team was outnumbered and outgunned, Adjutant Li was seriously injured, and five members of the Xikang security team escorting them were killed. Fortunately, the American investigation team suffered no casualties. They immediately led their troops down halfway up the mountain and defended the stone wall, finally relying on the arrival of reinforcements to repel the bandits.</p>
<p>Plateau Grasslands</p>
<p>Completing the Initial Task</p>
<p>In late July, the investigation team entered the possible crash zone, which is the southwestern and northwestern border area of Sichuan, belonging to the plateau grasslands, where Tibetan and Lolo people engage in nomadic activities. The Jinsha River and the Yalong, Anning, and Huitong Rivers flow from north to south, forming deep canyons with an elevation of about three thousand feet, surrounded by large and small snow mountains, and high peaks such as the Greater and Lesser Liang Mountains, and the Greater and Lesser Xiang Mountains. The climate of the plateau in the middle of the grassland is cold, with wild grass stretching for miles. Two-thirds of the residents are Yi people, who are brutal in nature and fierce in customs, regarding murder and robbery as commonplace, and are known as "Yi bandits." When the investigation team arrived, because the area was full of steep ridges and a necessary place for navigation, they proceeded cautiously, conducting careful reconnaissance. In dangerous places where high peaks entered the clouds and cliffs stood, with no road to pass through, they hammered ropes and descended to explore, going to great pains. Finally, on July 27, on the mountainside of Muerzhai Village, Dawei Township, Maogong, they found the wreckage of a B29 transport aircraft that had flown from India to Sichuan on the night of July 7, 1944, and crashed into the mountain at that location. The heroes who died in the aircraft had already been buried. After the initial completion of the mission, Lieutenant Han has telegraphed the American government and is now conducting further search work. After the reporter heard this brave wounded hero's adventure story, I deeply admired the great feats of modern society and the ancient Middle Ages, looked up at the savage skies and barbarian clouds, and wished them a successful return.</p>
<h3>River and Mountain Heroes! Chuxian Representatives Commemorate the Fallen Soldiers of Menglianggu</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent Ding Kuanghua, Nanjing, 15th] "August 13th" is a most somber anniversary. The 74th Division chose this day to commemorate the fallen soldiers who died in the suppression of bandits at Menglianggu. Thinking deeply about the pain, what profound and deep significance this holds! On this day, the city of Chuxian was filled with sorrow. The entire city fasted, as if mourning the death of a parent. The blood-soaked pennants further shed infinite tears for the loyal and brave martyrs! Chairman Chiang's representative, Senior Staff Officer Yang, came. Commander Wang Yaowu's representative, Deputy Commander Zheng, came. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo's representative, Chief of Staff Liu, came. When these senior officers heard the roars of their subordinates who heroically sacrificed themselves at Menglianggu, they could not sleep or eat in peace. Especially Zhang Lingfu, this brave general, they really couldn't help but come in person to participate today. However, that heart, that tear, we can imagine would be even more difficult and sad than personally walking to the spirits of the fallen soldiers.</p>
<p>Chuxian Middle School was temporarily used as the venue for the memorial service, the arrangement was solemn, and sadness was especially felt.</p>
<p>More than a thousand couplets</p>
<p>coincidentally regarded them as "Zhang Suiyang" and "Yue Wumu" of today. This was really not accidental. Chairman Chiang personally wrote "River and Mountain Heroes" and "Magnificent Righteousness." President Yu personally wrote "Great Knowledge, Great Benevolence, Great Courage." Chen Lifu personally wrote "Crimson Blood and Loyal Heart." All of them raised their eyebrows and breathed a sigh of relief for the fallen soldiers of Menglianggu.</p>
<p>In a somber atmosphere, Senior Staff Officer Yang, representing Chairman Chiang, read his message of condolence to the loyal and brave soldiers of the 74th Division. Next was Commander Zheng, representing Commander Wang Yaowu, giving instructions. Because Commander Wang had a special relationship with the 74th Division, his emotions and his grief were deeper than anyone else's. He said: "The 74th Division is a unit that is most dear and familiar to me. I once nurtured, educated, and cultivated it like an infant. Although it has left me in recent years, its growth, its development, and its achievements are still what I am most concerned about, and what I am happy to hear about.</p>
<p>In a rare opportunity, the reporter also interviewed Madam Zhang,</p>
<p>Ms. Wang Yuling</p>
<p>. At this time, her tears were still streaming down. The reporter took the opportunity to comfort her. After a while, she said to the reporter with sorrow: "He died, sacrificing himself for the country. This is supreme glory, but what is left to me is Shaoling, who is not yet half a year old, and an unbearable memory." Tears streamed down again. After a while, she slowly continued to say to the reporter: "Lingfu has lived up to the country, and the country has lived up to Lingfu in remembrance of this sacrifice. For me personally, it is unfortunate, but for the country and the nation, it is great. For a month and a half, I have been constantly grieving. Suddenly, one day, I saw in the newspaper the news that Chairman Chiang had bestowed the name "Lingfu" on a warship. How happy I was! The dead Lingfu seemed to be by my side. He didn't steal a life, so he died as heavy as Mount Tai. His wife, his son, and even his friends and classmates naturally regarded it as supreme glory." Then she said: "Lingfu will not let down the country, and I will absolutely not let down Lingfu. I have the courage to be progressive. I will raise Shaoling and invigorate myself even more. I will continue to encourage myself deeply, because I have only received a secondary education. If I am to live up to Lingfu, then I must continue my studies, inherit Lingfu's legacy, and do my part for the country. At the same time, I can comfort Lingfu's spirit in heaven. Shaoling is a lovely son, and he looks very much like his father. I hope to do my best to make him a talented person. Although I dare not compare myself to Mother Meng, I hope that Shaoling will become a Mencius." Madam Zhang is such an accomplished woman. The reporter deeply admired her in her heart. Finally, she told the reporter: "Division Commander Zhang is a typical soldier. I understand him best. I want to practice my writing and write a novel for him to commemorate him!" She said very happily: "This responsibility is too great. I will have to ask you and the press for a lot of help in the future!"</p>
<h3>Matchlocks, Pistols, Machine Guns All Available: Armed Clashes Occur in Guangji; 100,000 People Participate; Military Communications Cut Off</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hankou, 17th] It is learned that residents with the surnames Guo and Zhu in Guangji County, Hubei Province, recently engaged in fierce armed clashes. Both sides contacted people with other surnames to bolster their strength. The number of participants will reach 100,000, and they are using old and new weapons such as matchlocks, pistols, rifles, machine guns, and grenades, resulting in many deaths and injuries on both sides. The traffic between Wuxue and Guangji is almost completely cut off. The newly appointed County Magistrate Weng * blank *, holding * blank *, arrived in the province to request that personnel be sent to suppress the clashes.</p>
<h3>Infanticide Rampant in Fuzhou; Wish to Leave More Seeds for the Next Generation</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent, Fuzhou, 11th] Here, prices are high and life is difficult. Originally joyful events of giving birth to sons and daughters have now become a major threat. The trend of abandoning infants has become increasingly serious in Fuzhou recently, and babies often starve to death because no one adopts them. Yesterday, a bamboo basket was placed at the gate of the official residence of Cao Tingguang, director of the Provincial Social Affairs Office, * blank * Fengfang in the city. Inside was a newborn baby. Because no one adopted it, it starved to death within a few hours. All parties hope that the authorities will come up with appropriate relief measures for this serious problem.</p>
<h3>Demolition Project of Tianyou Embankment Difficult for Hunan Provincial Government to Implement</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent, Hengyang, 15th] The dispute between Hunan and Hubei provinces over the demolition of Tianyou Embankment in Dongting Lake has reached the breaking point. This spring, Minister of Water Resources Xue Dubi personally visited Hunan to investigate. Because Tianyou Embankment had not been repaired and there was no embankment to demolish, only the Hengzhou and Gu'er embankments within the scope of the embankment needed to be demolished. The central government remitted 1.71 billion yuan to Hunan for the demolition, urging construction. Hunan Province then sent</p>
<h3>Twists and Turns, Nearly Stillborn: Zhengzhou Agricultural Machinery Company Announced Its Establishment</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent Fan Shiqin, Zhengzhou, 11th] The Zhengzhou Agricultural Machinery Company, which the UNRRA General Headquarters has long hoped to facilitate, was established here on the 11th. However, at the time of delivery, various twists and turns occurred, almost resulting in a stillbirth. The company's capital was originally set at 2 billion yuan, with 1 billion yuan invested by four banks, 200 million yuan by the Henan Provincial Bank, 150 million yuan invested by 13 counties in public land at discounted prices, 100 million yuan by the Kaifeng Far East Enterprise Company, 100 million yuan by local people, and 630 million yuan by people from Xinxiang. At the inaugural meeting, the Xinxiang group suddenly announced their withdrawal. It is said that this group had previously submitted a list of directors, supervisors, and managers, etc., which was not accepted by the public, so they left in anger. The nature of the company is based on the principle of private operation, so there were also major disputes over the issue of equity arising from the investment of various banks. The banks believed that the investment of the banks was of an assisting nature, and that the banks could withdraw at any time in the future when local people increased their shares, but that there should be some limit to the current restriction of equity. However, the general local people advocated that the equity of each bank should be included within one unit, and that the equity should be calculated at 80% of the price for every 111 shares up to 100 shares, 70% of the price for every 101 shares up to 300 shares, and 60% of the price for every 201 shares up to 300 shares. As a result, the former followed the banks' proposal, and the latter followed the local people's proposal. Another twist was that Liu Chunnong, one of the elected directors, paid the money before the inaugural meeting, but the money had not yet been transferred to the account</p>

<h3>Heroes of the Flood Zone: Collectively Rescuing Food in the Water</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent Zong Chunlin, Xuzhou, 14th] The flood in northern Jiangsu this summer is unprecedented in 70 years. The disaster situation in Pi, Xiao, Tong, Xi, and Feng counties is particularly severe. The entire territory is submerged, and the autumn crops have all entered the water. The victims have no clothes or food and are in urgent need of relief. Huang Zanyao, Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, went to Pi County last Wednesday to investigate the disaster. When the car arrived at Bachaji, all he saw was a water sky, and the farmers' hopes for everything they had worked hard for all year were submerged by the water. The sorghum spikes were still struggling to lower their heads on the water surface. Soybeans, cotton, and other low-stalked plants rarely showed above the water surface. The further east he went, the more severe the flood became. Because of the obstruction of the Xuhai Highway, the flood rolled south at the speed of lettuce. The highway was submerged. Zhao * blank * was one of the most severely affected areas. Some time ago, when the water had not receded, the railways were all submerged. Thousands of refugees who fled from the water villages had grief carved on their faces and suffering recorded on their foreheads. The elderly wept incessantly, and the survivors were so sad that they could not bear it!</p>
<p>Sailing to Dayushu, in the vast ocean, looking out at the submerged fields and the half-submerged villages, was like a boat looking at small birds in the sea. Two hundred years ago, Dayushu was just a tree and two families, which slowly multiplied and have now become a large town with hundreds of households. However, the Dayushu was sold out during the War of Resistance and used as firewood. The Yunhe Rural Normal School, which cultivated countless talents before the war, now has all its houses in the water and its school buildings have also been destroyed.</p>
<p>A group of refugees, they collectively rescued the food in the water, tightly united together, and everyone ate the grain. One of the middle-aged men used a large door panel to push a bag of wet grain, floating on the water. He himself swam in the water, flipping the door panel, and traveled fifteen miles. We admire this hero of the disaster area</p>
<p>The sun was setting quickly. The black hands of the refugees, like charcoal sticks, threw the sorghum *blank* and devoured them hungrily. According to County Magistrate Wang Tianzhong, although the water level has dropped by three feet, it is still a water sky and the disaster is unabated. Needless to say next spring, in a month and a half, the terror of hunger will threaten the entire Pi County and more than three million disaster victims in northern Jiangsu.</p>

<h3>Shandong University Test Leak: Zhao Tai Mou Declares Not True</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper, Qingdao, 17th] Regarding the Shandong University test leak, according to the school president Zhao Tai Mou: On the afternoon of the 12th, the Physics and Chemistry test questions for the last session of the freshman exam at Shandong University were discovered by students of the school before the exam started. After investigation, the first four questions were the same as the prepared alternative questions. Since the school prepares two sets of test questions, primary and alternative, the exam was not affected. Subsequently, after the exam had started, students discovered that a part of the primary questions had been copied. At that time, some examinees had already finished the exam and left the venue, so it cannot be concluded that there was a leak beforehand. It was decided to investigate the truth on the one hand, in order to investigate and deal with it, and on the other hand, to evaluate the exam papers to see how the results were, as supporting evidence. The Qingdao district exam papers have now been graded, and the general results are not good, with no special signs that can prove a leak. The rumor about stealing and selling sealed test papers is impossible due to the strict procedures for preparing the papers, and there are no facts supporting such slanderous behavior.</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper, Qingdao, 16th] The discovery of the Shandong University freshman entrance exam test leak is as follows: The 12th was the day of the freshman exam. At 1:30 pm, two students from the Foreign Languages Department of the school, Liang Peilang and Li Junchao, were taking a walk and discovered that the incoming freshmen were gathering to copy the questions. They immediately seized a copy of the copied Physics and Chemistry questions and reported it to Dean of Academic Affairs, Yang Zhaolian. It was confirmed that they were the same as the alternative Physics and Chemistry questions for Group B at 2 pm that afternoon. The two students, under the instruction of Dean Yang, continued to pay attention and discovered the aforementioned copying of questions, that the copied questions were the same as the primary questions. For a time, everyone was shocked, and the "Democracy Wall" became quite lively. President Zhao Tai Mou returned to Qingdao from Shanghai on the 13th. He stated that he would thoroughly investigate. If there is evidence, he will submit it to the school affairs meeting to decide on a method for re-examination, or take other remedial measures, and ask all students to assist in finding clues and collecting evidence to jointly investigate.</p>

<h3>Minister of Finance Yu and Governor Zhang Issue Written Statements: Prices of Daily Necessities Will Not Change</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Minister of Finance Yu and Governor Zhang of the Central Bank issued written statements on the revision of the Foreign Exchange Management and Import and Export Trade Measures, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Minister Yu's Statement</p>
<p>Since the government announced the Measures for the Management of Import and Export Trade in November of last year, import and export trade has improved slightly compared to the past. However, as the difference between the official exchange rate and the market price has increased daily, exports are still difficult, overseas remittances are evaded, and smuggling of goods is becoming more rampant, which has a significant impact on the balance of international payments and the national economy, and urgently needs to be remedied. All remedial measures have been carefully studied by the government. After close examination by the State Council, the revised Interim Measures for the Central Bank's Management of Foreign Exchange and the Measures for Import and Export Trade have been passed and put into practice. Under these measures, the Central Bank will continue to supply foreign exchange at the current official exchange rate for essential goods such as cotton, rice, wheat, flour, fertilizer, and coal. The foreign exchange needed for other imported goods and various legitimate foreign exchange needs will be paid by the Central Bank and designated banks using export foreign exchange and remittances from overseas Chinese, all calculated at market prices. In order to balance the supply and demand of foreign exchange and stabilize exchange rates, the government has specially established a Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee to take charge of this responsibility. It is believed that after the implementation of these measures, the prices of daily necessities will not change significantly. The situation of exported goods and remittances from overseas Chinese can be improved compared to the past, which will greatly benefit the balance of international payments and the national economy. It is hoped that the people of the whole country will share the difficulties and enthusiastically assist the government in achieving its goals.</p>
<p>Governor Zhang's Statement</p>
<p>Our government's foreign exchange policy has always focused on stabilizing the foreign exchange market, hoping to maintain the stability of the general economy through the stability of foreign exchange. Since the foreign exchange adjustment in February to 12,000 national currency per US dollar, the officially set exchange rate has lost its effect due to the continued rise in domestic prices and rampant speculation. As a result, exports and overseas remittances have decreased, and the government's foreign exchange income has decreased. On the other hand, although import merchants and manufacturing industries have obtained low exchange rates to transport goods, most items are still sold at black market prices, from which they obtain excessive profits. As the government's foreign exchange income has decreased, it has had to gradually reduce the amount of foreign exchange settled at official prices, which has naturally had a considerable impact on legitimate businesses. Most of the foreign exchange has fallen into the hands of smugglers, and consumers have not received any benefit, leading to stagnation in business. In view of this, the government believes that it is necessary to revise the measures for foreign exchange and import and export management. According to the revised measures, the Central Bank will supply official exchange rates for daily necessities whose prices can be controlled by the government, such as cotton, rice, wheat, flour, coal, and coking coal. The remaining approved imports and financial payments will be settled and sold by designated banks at market prices, and foreign exchange obtained from exports and overseas remittances can also be sold to designated banks at market prices at market prices. According to precise estimates, except for the above-mentioned bulk daily necessities that are still settled by the government at official prices, the remaining amounts of exports, imports, receipts, and payments can be offset against each other. Therefore, after the implementation of the revised measures, the foreign exchange market is expected to gradually stabilize. The government is still concerned that imports and exports cannot always be offset against each other due to different seasons or other reasons, and will establish a Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee to prevent violent fluctuations in exchange rates. After the implementation of the revised measures, it is hoped that exports and remittances can be increased, and imports will continue to be strictly controlled, so that the balance of international payments can gradually be balanced. If the government's foreign exchange resources are sufficient, legitimate businesses will naturally improve day by day. The world is currently short of US dollars, and our country must prepare for a rainy day by increasing foreign exchange sources and saving foreign exchange, and striving to win overseas markets. In recent months, many industrial, commercial, and people's organizations and economic experts have advocated similar opinions, which the government has carefully considered and decided to adopt. However, the success or failure of all measures depends on the cooperation of the people. These measures have been adopted with public opinion, and it is expected that they will be supported by the public. It is hoped that export merchants will not take advantage of the more favorable market exchange rate to compete and raise prices, which will affect overseas markets and cause exports to decline again. It is also hoped that import merchants will not take advantage of the existence of market exchange rates to hoard and raise prices. It must be known that the purchasing power of the Chinese people is limited, and excessively high prices will inevitably lead to reduced sales and business depression. This is very clear and should be understood. Finally, there is a comforting matter, that is, our country's negotiations with the Hong Kong government on trade and foreign exchange issues have been successfully resolved. The Hong Kong government has made a separate statement, and the conclusion of this agreement is of great benefit to the common interests of both China and Hong Kong. It is also helpful to the implementation of these revised measures. I am deeply grateful for the cooperation spirit of the Hong Kong government.</p>

<h3>Chinese Plant Oil Factory Sends Personnel to Inspect Major Products of Taiwan Province - Wang Longsheng Discusses His Trip to Taiwan and Thoughts Upon His Return - Camphor Exports Have Stalled</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Chinese Plant Oil Factory, considering the shortage of fertilizer in Taiwan Province and the insufficient fertilizer production in various countries after the war, as well as the fact that various countries are purchasing it, leading to extreme scarcity, sent Wang Longsheng, manager of its Shanghai office, to Taiwan in mid-May to inspect various locations. In addition to seeking ways to promote the sale of "Zhi" brand soybean cakes, he also paid attention to the export situation of the province's major products. Mr. Wang has completed his mission in Taiwan and returned to Shanghai last week. He stated his experiences and thoughts on the trip, saying that in the past, the factory's soybean cakes were sold locally in Shanghai, so Taiwanese people were not familiar with the factory's "Zhi" brand soybean cakes. In order to promote regular and large-scale sales in the future, close attention should be paid to the province. In the past, Taiwan needed 200,000 tons of soybean cakes annually, mostly directly shipped from Dalian in the Northeast. Now, due to the reduced supply from the Northeast and the slightly higher prices, farmers cannot afford it, resulting in a significant decrease in consumption.</p>
<p>Production Overview</p>
<p>Regarding the current situation of major products in Taiwan Province, Mr. Wang stated: "The camphor factory still has about 400 to 500 tons of improved B-grade camphor, refined camphor, camphor flakes, and camphor tablets. It can produce 60 tons per month thereafter, but no more than 720 tons per year, which is still two times lower than the highest production before the war. Camphor exports have almost come to a standstill in the past six months. However, European countries cannot regularly rely on our country's camphor supply and have to use artificial camphor from other sources. It is recently heard that artificial camphor factories in Germany and other places have resumed operation, producing in large quantities, with prices at US$0.70 per pound, almost half the price of products from Taiwan Province. This is a major threat to Taiwan's camphor exports. (2) Taiwan Province produces raw materials for cosmetics, with the most famous being fragrant oils, such as those derived from camphor oil, including Saffa oil, Eucalyptus oil, and Fang oil. The first two are sold to European countries, and the latter can be sold to the United Kingdom, the United States, and Europe. Saffa oil can produce 10 tons per month, and Eucalyptus oil and Fang oil can each produce 5 tons. In addition, there is also citronella oil, which is also a good export product. This year, Taiwan Province is expected to produce less than 15,000 Taiwan jin, leading to a situation of demand exceeding supply. Shanghai merchants are competing to purchase it, and the oil price has risen from NT$450 to over NT$600 per Taiwan jin. (3) Regarding the current situation of pineapple production, the world's most famous pineapple producers are Hawaii, Malaya, and Taiwan. Taiwanese products are not as good as Hawaiian products in quality, but the price is cheaper. Malayan products are cheaper than Taiwanese products, but the quality is not as high as Taiwan Province. Recently, due to the lack of tinplate in our country, canned raw materials are scarce, affecting pineapple exports. Before the war, the highest annual production was 1.6 million boxes, mostly exported. This year's expected volume is 100,000 boxes, each box worth about 300,000 National Currency. The value of can manufacturing accounts for about 45% of the total cost, which is something that urgently needs attention."</p>
<p>Industrial Revival</p>
<p>Mr. Wang concluded his observations from his trip to Taiwan by stating that after the restoration, various petroleum, mineral, and industrial enterprises in Taiwan, such as oil refineries, oil mines, aluminum companies, and copper mining companies, were taken over by the Resources Commission. Other important industries, such as sugar companies, machinery shipbuilding companies, electricity, alkali industry, cement, paper, and fertilizer companies, were also jointly operated by the Commission and the Provincial Government. The situation is very good, and most of them have been repaired and started operation. Currently, the sugar company has the largest scale and business volume. According to its original plan, it plans to increase production to 500,000 tons next year, which would be worth a total of US$250 million if each ton is priced at US$500. Currently, various industrial conditions in Taiwan Province, such as electricity, labor, building materials, and chemical equipment, are much cheaper than in Shanghai. It is most ideal for starting factories. Taiwan Province has a population of about 6.5 million, and the largest port is Keelung, which can accommodate ocean-going vessels of 10,000 to 20,000 tons. If the central authorities can improve the current import and export measures and promote active trade, Taiwan Province will undoubtedly be one of the most important commercial centers. The annual demand for fertilizer, cotton, and cotton textiles in the province, as well as the export of sugar, tea, camphor, pineapples, and other goods, is considerable and worthy of attention.</p>
<h3>National Cotton Production Survey Statistics</h3>
<p>The Yarn Association Decides to Publish in Three Installments</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] The 21st joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the National Yarn Mill Association was held yesterday afternoon from 4:30 pm in the conference room of the China Textile Construction Company. Fifteen or sixteen directors and supervisors attended, chaired by Dong Yunzhang, and adjourned around 7:00 pm.</p>
<p>The meeting yesterday reported the following matters: (1) The national cotton production survey statistics for this year were decided to be published in three installments on August 31, October 20, and December 20 of this year. (2) The general survey of spindles and looms in national yarn mills is now mostly ready and will be published soon. (3) District associations have been established one after another in various districts, including District 1 (Chongqing), District 2 (Shaanxi), District 3 (Kunming), District 6 (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui), District 7 (Tianjin), District 8 (Hankou), and District 9 (Qingdao). Currently, after the establishment of the Northeast District Association, district associations will have been organized nationwide.</p>
<p>Discussion Items: (1) It was decided to convene a three-day general meeting of members of the National Yarn Mill Association in Shanghai starting on September 20 of this year to re-elect directors and supervisors. Wu Weijing, Rong Erren, Liu Piji, and Xi Wangshu, among others, were nominated to form a general meeting preparatory committee, with Wu Weijing as the convener. (2) Regarding donations for the floods in Liangguang and northern Jiangsu, the Sixth District Association plans to contribute 25 billion yuan. (3) Considering that the textile industry occupies a very important position in industry, it was resolved to submit the following two points to the Executive Yuan: (a) The National Economic Commission should include two textile industry representatives to facilitate liaison during decision-making. (b) The textile industry should have at least five seats in the business inspection delegation to Japan.</p>
<h3>Northeast Remittance Increased</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The Northeast remittance was previously regulated by the Northeast Administrative Committee, stipulating that the remittance for each person per month should not exceed 30,000 Northeast circulating notes. Now, due to rising prices, 30,000 circulating notes are insufficient to meet actual needs. The post office has now been approved to increase it to 100,000 circulating notes. According to the current ratio of 12 National Currency to 1 circulating note, it is equivalent to approximately 1.2 million National Currency.</p>
<h3>Silk Goods Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the announcement of selling foreign exchange at market prices, the silk goods market, although it was Sunday, was unusually excited. Quilt fabrics jumped by 1 million yuan. Huaqiang goods reached a maximum of 11.7 million yuan, 120,000 to 130,000 yuan higher than Huaqiang goods. Plaid crepe was quoted at around 37,000 yuan, but there were no transactions. The asking prices for other goods were 5% to 10% higher, but both buyers and sellers were waiting to see, and transactions were very rare.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Market Sentiment Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market, although it was Sunday, was quite excited. This was because after the government announced improvements in foreign exchange management, there were various speculations. Cigarette raw materials are considered non-essential goods, and it was feared that the cost would be affected by calculating it at the black market exchange rate later, so cargo owners were waiting to see. Taking advantage of this, speculators raised prices, and market sentiment soared.</p>
<p>Ten-pack British cigarettes reached a new high of 12.7 million, closing at 1.65 million at noon, up 650,000 from the previous day. Old Blade also rose by 370,000 to 8.8 million yuan. Hadamen rose by 350,000 to 7.75 million yuan. Popular goods from Chinese factories, such as Beauty, Great Cyrus, Hundred Gold, and Brandy, rose sharply. All Green Double Axe alone remained stable. However, there were many resales after the close, and the market sentiment showed a softening trend.</p>
<h3>Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Coal Mines Request Three Points from the Government</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changsha, 17th] The Coal Mine Industry Association of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi has been established and recently submitted the following requests to the government: (1) Provide loans to help expand equipment to increase production. (2) Employees in the coal mining industry should be allowed to defer military service. (3) Order railway and shipping agencies to prioritize the transportation of coal to alleviate the coal shortage.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Business Community Prepares for Trade with Japan</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Chengdu, 17th] Amidst the opening of trade with Japan, the Sichuan business community is actively preparing for exports to Japan. The Sichuan Handicraft Industry Federation convened a general meeting on the 17th and decided to improve products and prepare to export Sichuan specialties, with silk as the main export to Japan. Jianye has prepared a plan to increase autumn cocoon production by 35 million dan in Nanchong and other places.</p>
<h3>Local Tin Foil Production Sufficient to Meet Cigarette Factory Demand</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] According to a survey by the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, with the equipment of local factories, the monthly production of tin foil can reach 20,000 boxes, which can be used to package 120,000 boxes of cigarettes. The total production volume of local cigarette factories averages about 100,000 boxes per month, and the total production volume in other areas is estimated by the tin foil industry to be about 20% of the local volume. Therefore, local production is sufficient to meet the monthly demand for tin foil by cigarette factories nationwide. Currently, in addition to using tin foil for packaging, some cigarette factories also use aluminum foil. This aluminum foil comes from abroad, and the Hua Aluminum Steel Factory of the local Swiss merchant also produces a large quantity. However, the aluminum blocks used as raw materials still need to be imported from abroad. Using aluminum foil or tin foil to package cigarettes only serves to prevent moisture. Compared to the two, tin foil may be superior. At a time when foreign exchange is in short supply, cigarette factories should switch to using domestically produced tin foil, which can not only avoid unnecessary consumption of foreign exchange but also maintain the sustainability of our country's tin foil industry.</p>
<h3>National Bank Initiates Organization of National Income Research Association</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] The statistics of national income are extremely important for economic research and policy decisions. National income, capital accumulation, and international balance of payments are the basic figures required by a country for economic decision-making. In order to provide accurate statistical data on national income to meet the needs of economic decision-making, the Economic Research Department of the Central Bank has initiated the organization of the Joint Statistical Research Committee on National Income in China. It has obtained the approval of relevant agencies such as the Ministries of Finance, Economics, Agriculture and Forestry, Food, Interior Affairs, Transportation, and Social Affairs, as well as the Resources Commission and the Academia Sinica, to jointly form a preparatory committee and actively promote the matter. It is expected that the formal organization will be established soon.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Announces Stamp Tax Inspection Rules</h3>

<p>New Medicine and New Drugs</p>
<p>— Edited by the Shanghai Medical Association</p>
<h3>Please Consider This, Medical Administration Authorities</h3>
<p>— Zhi Gong</p>
<p>The lack of doctors in China is well known, and those who have gone deep into the interior have felt the pain of it firsthand. Once they fall ill, they cannot even find a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner for diagnosis and treatment, let alone a Western doctor who is as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. However, it has recently been heard that there are more than 2,000 "unlicensed" doctors along the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou line, and even more in Shanghai alone. This deformed and strange phenomenon is caused by poor politics. For the sake of making a living, these people know that this is a deformed life that kills without shedding blood. It is not in line with the democratic politics of society, and they should also feel ashamed in their hearts. However, since there is no other way to make a living, they can only resign themselves to fate and muddle through. However, there are also many progressive and studious people among them who want to seek spiritual nourishment but cannot. Those who are scheming in society take advantage of this opportunity to cater to their preferences, using learning as bait to lure their wealth, and gradually using their large numbers of people to privately teach them strategies for gaining support. By this means, they are able to advance on the path of politics. The so-called emphasis on "quantity" rather than "quality" is merely a tool for enticing the masses. If the representatives of the national people are all obtained in this way, then it is clear that the national construction strategies they formulate when they are in power in the future will ultimately be unorthodox. For example, when a country is plagued by chaos, it must either suppress or appease it, and it must never sit idly by and watch the chaos spread. The reason why unlicensed doctors have gone astray is none other than the indecisiveness of the medical administration authorities. As it stands, since it is no longer possible to eliminate them by suppression, the only way to appease them is through guidance. Those who can be taught through training can become doctors, and those who cannot be taught can be divided into nurses and distributed to various parts of the interior to benefit the poor and sick. Is this not a plan that can achieve both goals? However, the policymakers are unable to come up with such a plan, and their measures are inconsistent. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Government, without knowing on what legal basis, suddenly held an examination for unlicensed doctors in early June of this year, issuing temporary business licenses based on the results. The Examination Yuan turned a deaf ear to such a major event in the medical administration field. Is Shanghai not Chinese territory? It is heard that unlicensed doctors have repeatedly petitioned the government last year, but the government has not yet made a clear statement. As the era of constitutional government is approaching, policymakers should quickly convene unlicensed doctors for examination and screening, and those who fail should be given "re-education," so that those who are scheming and those who play with the masses cannot take advantage of them. This is a virtuous policy that will correct the deformed state of society and benefit the country and society.</p>
<h3>The Abuse of Tonics</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>In the current medical and pharmaceutical field, there are too many abnormal developments to count. The abuse of tonics mentioned in this article is one of the most important things that cannot be ignored. Originally, the nickname "Sick Man of East Asia," which has been accepted for decades and has not yet been erased, coupled with the adjectives that have always praised women for being "frail" and "able to dance in the palm of one's hand," should be regarded as trivial and not worth making a fuss about. However, the actual situation is by no means limited to this. I dare say that at least half of the examples are not suitable. To give two common examples: Vitamin B1 is a special agent for resisting beriberi, but the results applied to the original disease probably only account for one or two tenths of the total. It is true that its scope of application in medicine is very broad, but a part of the abuse (can be used or not, no different from a disguised seasoning) is undeniable. Vitamin C is a special agent for treating scurvy, purpura, etc., and also has the functions of resisting infection and treating bleeding. However, there are also many people who use it without any relation to the aforementioned diseases. Some people regard it completely as a tonic, and even think that the more tonics the better, and ask doctors to inject large amounts every day to seek quick results. This is a unique phenomenon in the medical field of our country, which is beyond the reach of European and American countries. The responsibility for this cannot be said to be completely absent on the part of the doctors. In fact, most patients have a smattering of knowledge and pretend to know what they do not know. Although doctors want to turn the tide, the result is nothing more than "a mantis trying to stop a chariot"!</p>
<p>The formation of the patient's psychology has gradually developed and can be said to have a traditional basis of thousands of years. Especially the rich, they usually live in luxury and dignity, and only tonics can show their noble status. For example, he complains of symptoms such as dizziness, tinnitus, blurred vision, fatigue, and weakness of the limbs. Even though it is caused by "playing mahjong for three nights," "dancing all night," and insomnia, this root cause is far less easy to listen to than saying that he is physically weak. Moreover, it is generally recognized that tonics have all benefits and no disadvantages, and the injections of new medicine can be directly injected into the body without having to pass through the digestive organs, and there is no need to worry about the stomach and intestines being unable to tolerate them and causing blockage. As a result, it is of course the general trend; and the market for tonics is also rising, forming a Jin-Chu struggle for hegemony with other daily necessities!</p>
<p>Once medicine is abused, various abnormal phenomena also arise. According to what the author can think of at the moment, there are already several types that can be described: (1) Using non-tonics as tonics. For example, glucose calcium injections are used to treat pulmonary tuberculosis, and other uses are not wide. However, there are also quite a few people who use them as tonics and inject them for a long time. (2) Meaningless application. What can be mentioned here is pure glucose injection. It has the functions of diuresis, detoxification, and increasing nutrition. Because glucose, salt, and water do not need to go through physiological digestion and can be directly input into the human body through the blood for needs. In acute infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, he is in bed for a long time, the amount of food is reduced, and he is also consumed by daily high fever, so it is inevitable that the patient needs to increase nutrition. His injection is of course suitable. Other diseases can also be inferred accordingly. However, in general patients who claim to be weak and have no shortage of three meals a day, their stomach and digestive functions are completely healthy and undamaged, so there is no need to do more. Because his nutrition can be fully supplied by food, even if the digestive function is weak, he can also treat the symptoms of the stomach and intestines, without having to overstep his responsibilities. (3) Increase in quantity. This is based on the psychology that tonics are beneficial and harmless and "the more the better." The above-mentioned example of injecting a large amount of Vitamin C every day is one of them. Regarding the use of Vitamin B1: a large amount is needed for symptoms such as beriberi and neuritis to be effective. For conditions such as indigestion, gastrointestinal diseases, weakness after illness, and weakness of the limbs, only a small amount is sufficient. A large amount will be quickly excreted, with no practical benefit, and it is a waste of money and not economical. However, some patients always feel that spending more money is nothing to them, and the larger the amount of tonics, the more effective they will be. On the contrary, they dislike the doctors for seeking accuracy in the amount used, which is a petty and stingy look. The author once mentioned this to a colleague, who replied with a smile: I don't think it matters, at most the urine and sweat will have a fragrance! This is truly the "fragrant sweat dripping"! Laugh!</p>
<p>So, when is it necessary to use tonics? This is a question that must be answered in this article. According to medical needs, there are the following: (1) After a major illness; (2) After surgery; (mostly due to excessive blood loss and weakened physical strength;) (3) During pregnancy and after childbirth for women; (4) Patients with cachexia; (5) Congenital deficiency; (6) Other; The last item includes a wider range. Whether it is suitable or not must be determined by the attending physician face-to-face at the time, and it is by no means what this article</p>
<p>Regarding the application of tonics, on the part of the doctor, of course, there is a basis and it cannot be done casually. Taking blood tonic as an example, for people with sallow skin or pale complexion, it can be known at a glance just by surface observation; but other cases cannot be followed by this example. It is necessary to be meticulous and conduct a detailed examination, including the components of hemoglobin, the number of red and white blood cells, the construction situation, and what pathological causes are lurking, and none of them can be ignored. Generally speaking, people think that the more blood in the human body, the better, so there is no drawback to blood tonic, which is a complete misinterpretation. To give a casual example, it is not suitable for patients with arteriosclerosis. Currently, the popular blood tonic liver paste does not seem to be suitable for diabetic patients either. Recently, hormone agents have been particularly popular, among which testosterone propionate injections are especially the darling of the heavens. In fact, it is not a tonic, and young people should not use it lightly (except for patients who are suitable), and they should even increase the weight (25mg), because they think the 10mg dose is too light, which is difficult to understand its purpose. Speaking of this, it is truly what the heart feels to be dangerous and must be expressed!</p>
<p>In short, tonics are not unusable; but whether they are suitable or not, the right to choose rests in the hands of the doctor. The author humbly offers 100% sincerity and sincerely asks patients to work hard to improve.</p>
<h3>Notice to Prospective Medical Students (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ruan Shangzheng</p>
<p>I am not against the theories of most patriots who want to preserve the national spirit and the quintessence of Chinese culture, but we must also consider the facts. Science in China has not yet reached the stage of independence and self-reliance. Those seeking knowledge must read original editions, and the application of Chinese in science is quite inconvenient. Individuals with aspirations often want to improve the Chinese script to make it convenient and applicable to science, but this cannot be achieved in the short term. For an immediate solution, we can only abandon distant goals and aim for what's near. Thus, scholars should dedicate themselves to research, and capable individuals should take charge of health administration. Seeking knowledge benefits both oneself and the country. As for how to improve Chinese and how to Sinicize medicine, these can only be discussed after political stability is achieved. Consider the history of the Germanic peoples. When their cultural level was still very low, those who could speak French were considered elegant. For example, Frederick the Great, who revived the Germanic people, used French entirely in his language, writing, and even the names of his palaces. Later, as the culture of the Germanic peoples improved day by day, great literary figures such as Goethe emerged, creating beautiful German. Consequently, people gradually abandoned French and used German exclusively. The *Chongqing Dagongbao* on July 10, year thirty-four, reported that the People's Political Council adopted the Ministry of Education's report, which included the statement "and plans to promote foreign language education," presumably with profound intentions. Therefore, the use of English throughout the medical field is even more justified.</p>
<p>In domestic health organizations, whether writing or speaking, English is used. Consequently, those who do not learn English but are proficient in other foreign languages face many inconveniences in collaboration. Even if there are those who stand out from the crowd, although they may be fortunate enough not to be regarded as unorthodox, they are ultimately ineffective. The resignation of a certain university president and a certain bureau director serves as clear evidence. They are simply recognizing the signs of the times. Mr. Tang Erzhou once said to me this spring when he went abroad, "The reason I can stand in the health field is because I have a slight knowledge of English." This is another strong piece of evidence. Mr. Tang is a graduate of Chiba University in Japan, and he can also understand English documents.</p>
<p>The government does not approve of practicing medicine without studying it properly. But in fact, those who study medicine but do not understand English have few opportunities for further study and development other than practicing medicine, unless they are willing to be minor staff in the health field. Examining the facts can prove this. Those who aspire to study medicine but do not intend to practice and wish to develop academically or professionally in the future will find it much more convenient to enroll in English-language medical schools than in non-English-language medical schools. People often say that there is a shortage of medical personnel, insufficient to meet the needs of the country. However, what is lacking is medical personnel who have studied English. A certain institution is also short of personnel to manage. However, graduates of a certain medical school are virtually unemployed. This is not a policy shield of the government; the real insider story is like this. I sincerely hope that those applying to medical schools will not go astray.</p>
<p>The author is a medical person who is not proficient in English and offers sincere advice based on past experiences and facts. Those with discernment will certainly not regard my words as excessive. However, if these words came from someone who only understands English, it would inevitably arouse resentment.</p>
<p>Jun Qing notes that this article by Dr. Ruan is probably a heartfelt expression. As medical professionals, we naturally hope that medical schools are free of factions, doctors are free of factions, and especially that those in power in health administration are free of factions, so that progress can be made in health and among colleagues. Otherwise, if we only shift with the rise and fall of international forces, it will not only cause the authorities to be indecisive and exhausted but also lose the meaning of an independent country. As for the words "Consequently, those who do not learn English but are proficient in other foreign languages face many inconveniences in collaboration. Even if there are those who stand out from the crowd, although they may be fortunate enough not to be regarded as unorthodox, they are ultimately ineffective. The resignation of a certain university president and a certain bureau director serves as clear evidence," although he did not specify who he was referring to, I do not want to make wild speculations. However, I am well aware that a certain doctor was only an ordinary doctor before the court, and he had virtually no achievements in academic research. Later, after going abroad for gilding for less than a year, he did not even grasp the basics of public health. After returning to the country, he managed to get a key position in medical administration in the midst of war and chaos, and gradually became the director of a certain bureau. If this kind of person is appointed to this position, how can the medical profession not be harmed? If it is said that he is content in his position because of factional differences, then that is not entirely the case.</p>
<h3>Preface to "Collected Medical Essays of Fan"</h3>
<p>— Fan Shouyuan</p>
<p>I have collected, organized, and compiled my writings from the past few decades, which were sporadic and piecemeal, into this book. Except for a small part that was missed or excluded, most of them are included here. I have also titled this book "Collected Medical Essays of Fan."</p>
<p>I feel infinite emotion when publishing this collection of essays.</p>
<p>I started writing this kind of health and medicine-related text nearly twenty years ago. The time I spent writing this type of material was always based on momentary feelings, feeling the social environment at the time needed this type of material, needed me to do this work, and then I started writing. Therefore, the texts here, whether they are about health and medical common sense or comments and reviews, are all about things that happened at that time, giving me a stimulus. Due to the stimulus of these things, a feeling arose, and based on the feeling at the time, I wrote this type of text. I wrote this type of text because I wanted to have some impact on the medical culture of our country, to give the general public who lacked medical knowledge some common sense of medicine and hygiene. In particular, I wanted them to have a correct understanding and accurate knowledge of their own health problems and medical problems. I never expected that today—nearly twenty years later—a large part of these past writings would still be collected here for publication. Today, Chinese society still needs me to collect these old and worn-out articles of the past here for publication. This is not an honor for me. On the contrary, it proves that the progress of the issue of medical culture in Chinese society during this long process of time has been far too slow. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Medical View of Watermelon</h3>
<p>— Shou Wuqing</p>
<p>Watermelon is one of the fruits, known to old and young alike. Eating it during the hot summer months refreshes the mind and spirit. Moreover, it is priced low, making it a common summer product for both rich and poor classes, unlike oranges, apples, pears, and grapes, which are aristocratic and expensive, making it difficult for the poor to afford.</p>
<p>There are many types of watermelons, and the quality varies. According to watermelon sellers, Shanghai watermelons are famous for those from Pinghu, which are long and round and sweet, with varying sizes. There are also those from the Chongming area of northern Jiangsu, which are of poorer quality and slightly longer in shape, with pointed ends. There are also those from other places, which are round in shape. Some say that the origin of the watermelon does not vary by shape but only by quality. Roughly speaking, Pinghu watermelons are sweet, and Chongming watermelons are bland. There is really no single rule.</p>
<p>According to research, watermelons were originally a foreign product. Historical records state that the Khitans conquered the Uyghurs and obtained watermelon seeds, which they quickly returned to the Central Plains. Since its introduction, it has had a considerable history. The method of planting is the same as that of other melons. In the second month of the lunar calendar, sow the seeds in the soil, cover them with cow dung, wait for them to germinate, transplant them in rows, and gradually grow. They produce five-lobed palmate leaves, and the stems are like threads, soft and flexible, coiled on the soil surface, gradually spreading to a length of one or two zhang, producing pale yellow petal-shaped flowers. The flowers fall and bear fruit, which becomes as large as a dou, and is green or green, or alternating green and green, so named watermelon, because it came from the west. Since the Five Dynasties, it has spread all over the north and south of the Yangtze River. Because of the different soil, planting methods, fertilizers, and climates, its shape and color are very different. Even the inside of the melon has red, yellow, white, light red, and light white colors. As for the intensity of the taste, in addition to selecting varieties and cultivation, it is also directly related to the weather. Some say that there has been more rain this year, and the taste of the melons is inferior, which seems to be not without reason.</p>
<p>According to old medical properties, watermelon tastes sweet, bland, and slightly cold, and is non-toxic. Some say that it is slightly toxic in large quantities. It functions to quench thirst, relieve summer heat, moisten fluids, and promote urination. Eating too much can harm the spleen and stomach, causing fullness in the chest and diaphragm, abdominal distension, and occasional belching. People with weak bodies may experience flatulence and intestinal fermentation, resulting in a large amount of gas, causing light farts and rumbling sounds. Ancient books record that eating too much watermelon in the summer will cause severe diarrhea in the autumn. It is also said that Chen Fengyuan, the prefect of Fangzhou in the past, liked to eat watermelon, and he ate a lot of it. After eating it for a long time, he suddenly had back pain and could not move. He visited famous doctors for diagnosis and treatment, and it took a long time to heal. (Yanshou Book) Also, eating watermelon with sesame cake can harm the spleen.</p>
<p>According to new experiences, it is not impossible for older children with normal digestion and good health to eat a small amount of watermelon. If infants or older children eat too much watermelon, it is not only not beneficial but also very harmful. It is common to see eating too much watermelon causing vomiting and diarrhea, resulting in acute gastroenteritis, or other infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, cholera, and dysentery, which are most common, due to unclean washing of watermelon skins and contamination with sewage.</p>
<p>The flesh of the watermelon is called Rang. It has the function of relieving heat. In ancient times, Chinese medicine borrowed it, calling it "natural Baihu Decoction." Patients with heat syndrome may use it as a heat-relieving and cooling agent. It is also said that its juice can cure mouth sores. The skin is sweet, cool, and non-toxic, and is usually discarded on the street, but it can be candied or medicated for consumption, or stir-fried to accompany dishes. Eating too much watermelon can cause fullness and stuffiness. Watermelon skin can be decocted in water to relieve it. (Shilin Guangji)</p>
<p>Between the Rang of the watermelon are mixed watermelon seeds, yellow and black, non-toxic. They are dried, stored, fried and eaten, and their taste is endless. Sweet and fragrant stir-fry, each is suitable, relieving boredom and leisure, especially called the best. In the Jiangzhe area, it is often used to entertain guests during the New Year. Suzhou watermelon seeds are known for their uniqueness, fragrant and crispy, and are essential for travelers. Some elderly patients with high blood pressure eat the kernels raw, saying that it can lower blood pressure, which is commonly called a single prescription, but the effect is not certain. I have seen a middle-aged patient who took raw watermelon kernels for as long as three months. The examination result was that his blood pressure dropped from 160 degrees to 150 degrees. The total amount of watermelon seeds eaten reached twenty catties.</p>
<p>Watermelon is a fruit product of our country, and European and American medical books do not record it. It is not found in the British and American pharmacopoeias. Its qualitative and quantitative analysis has not been examined in detail, but upon careful inspection, it only contains a small amount of hydrocarbons (sugar), a large amount of water, a trace amount of vitamin HC, no calorie (the name of the heat unit) supply, and no nourishing elements. Considering the actual situation, the value of a watermelon, at most, is only slightly better than a cup of rock sugar boiled water. Some say that eating more watermelon can reduce the occurrence of sores and boils, or that eating more watermelon can cure constipation, or that eating more watermelon can stop diarrhea and dysentery, or that eating more watermelon juice can cure injuries and high fever, or that eating more watermelon can cure kidney inflammation. All of these are unfounded rumors and cannot be based on a medical point of view, and are not worth believing.</p>

<h3>Engineering and Science</h3>
<p>— Zhao Nan</p>
<p>The gradual development of airplanes from invention to practical use can be said to be the highest expression of modern human culture. In the past twenty years, aviation and other engineering fields have made rapid progress. Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, invented many years ago, was only a simple equation of mass becoming energy; E=MC2 means energy is mass, and C is the speed of light. But today, this equation has been practically applied in atomic energy. To give another example, today's aircraft can reach speeds of 627 miles per hour, ranges of 100,000 miles, and altitudes of tens of thousands of meters. These figures were unimaginable twenty years ago.</p>
<p>Why has engineering made such leaps and bounds in the past twenty years? This question is very important, and we must study it carefully. Before twenty years ago, progress in engineering was simply the accumulation of practical experience in various fields. Therefore, every project had to be learned through practice, and tested after it was done well. This was time-consuming and expensive, and of course engineering could not make significant progress.</p>
<p>But in the past twenty years, engineering has no longer relied solely on the experience of predecessors. They have taken experience as a reference, using analytical methods and adopting basic scientific theories to promote progress together. Relying solely on experience is certainly slow to progress; but theory alone is also unworkable. Engineers twenty years ago thought that theory was of no help to practice, so they were eliminated.</p>
<p>We only know that Newton was a great scientist, and his contributions to physics and mathematics are well known to women and children. In fact, he was also a practical bridge engineer. Similarly, the great mathematician Euler had a formula in mathematics, and at the same time, he created an epoch-making formula in the study of columns in strength of materials.</p>
<p>The reason why scientists such as Newton and Euler were great is that they were able to integrate theory and practice. But today, scientific theories are becoming increasingly profound, and practical engineering is becoming increasingly complex. It is no longer possible for one person to see the whole picture of theory and practice. Today's great scientists can no longer be engineers. This trend of division of labor and cooperation is deepening day by day.</p>
<p>For example, in hydraulics, the theoretical aspect assumes that water is a "perfect fluid," that is, incompressible and non-viscous, which makes it easy to solve problems mathematically. But from the perspective of engineering science, water is not only slightly compressible, but its viscosity is also quite large. Therefore, the most important thing about all the formulas in hydraulics is the coefficient obtained from practical experience.</p>
<p>In the early 20th century, basic science and engineering unfortunately parted ways, and the distance between them became greater and greater. At this time, a savior suddenly appeared. This was Professor Felix Klein, the authority on mathematics in Europe at the time. He traveled from Europe to the United States to visit the first World's Fair in Chicago, and found that the United States had abundant resources and great wealth. He felt that Europe had no way to compete with the United States. The only way was to improve European engineering. So he decided to dedicate himself to linking pure science and practical engineering. Back in Europe, he founded the Department of Applied Mechanics. Many of the students in this department are now famous engineering scientists, such as Prandtl V. Kamani Timoshenko;</p>
<p>Busemann and Ackerest and so on. But old Professor Klein's goal was half successful, and half failed. Most of these students have become American citizens in the United States today, helping the United States to compete with Europe.</p>
<p>Since old Professor Klein founded the Department of Applied Mechanics, engineering science has embarked on the right track, and engineering has made unprecedented progress in the past twenty years, and the future is booming.</p>
<h3>Silent Typewriter</h3>
<p>— Mei</p>
<p>The typewriters we use now make a "tap, tap, tap" sound, which becomes annoying after listening to it for a long time. Many engineers are studying how to manufacture silent typewriters, but none have succeeded. Recently, the US Patent Office issued Patent No. 2418.698 to Frederick U. Conard, granting him the legal right to patent his invention of a silent typewriter.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, this invention is not particularly new. It only adds an extra layer to the rubber cushion inside the typewriter, like a grid with small pores and cracks. The size of the grid is just the size of the font on each key. A steel rod is used as the center inside the rubber cylinder. Each time a character is typed, the grid moves out one grid, and there is no vibration transmitted to the sides. Therefore, the entire cylinder does not make a sound. This is the principle of the silent typewriter structure. The patent was sold to Underwood Corporation, and silent typewriters may appear in the near future.</p>
<h3>Arctic Climate</h3>
<p>— Song Liwu</p>
<p>In geography, the area north of 66.5 degrees north latitude is collectively referred to as the Arctic region. Arctic expert Sir Huberi Wilkins, however, defines it from a climatic point of view as any area where the average temperature of the hottest month of the year is below 10 degrees Celsius. According to Koppen's classification of world climates, any area within this temperature range has permanently frozen soil and crops cannot grow. Even cold-resistant coniferous trees such as pines and cypresses have difficulty growing, and only mosses and lichens grow on the ground, which is called tundra or frozen desert climate (Tundra).), its southern boundary roughly coincides with the Arctic Circle. Although the hottest month south of this climate zone is above ten degrees, the coldest month is below negative three degrees. The winters and summers are distinct, and it occupies a vast area of land. All of northern Eurasia and North America and Greenland Iceland, etc. belong to it. Except for Northwestern Europe, most of it has not been fully developed, and the scene is desolate, not much different from the polar regions, so it is also included in the scope of this article for discussion.</p>
<p>The factors influencing climate change are quite complex. The distribution of sea and land, the direction and height of the terrain, the size of the solar radiation angle, and the warmth of ocean currents are all major factors that distinguish the nature of the climate and form a complex climate. Therefore, although areas are at the same latitude or even two places very close to each other, they often differ greatly and the scenes are completely different. Therefore, those who discuss regional climates must pay attention to this. The regional descriptions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Polar Climate The Arctic is an ocean basin surrounded by a large continent, with a depth of more than 4,000 meters. There is a narrow Bering Strait between Asia and North America connecting the Pacific Ocean basin. There is a relatively wide passage between North America and Greenland and Europe connecting to the Atlantic Ocean. The ocean is frozen almost all year round. However, only part of the surface melts in summer. In winter, it is a solid ice. Guangting extends to the coasts of Siberia, North America, and Greenland. In addition to the coast of Northwestern Europe being washed by the warm current of the Green Sea, the rest of the Kara Sea (Kera Sea) Baffin Bay (Baffin Bay), etc. are also completely frozen.</p>
<p>The Arctic climate is known for its coldness. In reality, its winter temperature is higher than that of other vast continental high-pressure areas, such as northeastern Siberia, northern Canada, and inland Greenland. However, the winter cold period is too long, and the longest night can last for as long as six months. The opposite is true for half of the summer, but the solar radiation angle is very low, the light is weak, and the impact of ground ripening is not obvious. Near the poles, the average temperature in January is about -40C Ellesmere Island (Ellesmere I.) is slightly continental, as low as -48 C to -51 C. Areas covered by ice and snow near the sea are slightly warmer, with an average of about -40 C to -29 C in the coldest month. The Gulf Stream washed area is the warmest area in the polar region, such as Frans Tosef Land -24 C, Green Harbour and Spitsbergen -22.5C. The temperature on the west coast of the above islands can rise to above negative 18 degrees under the southwest wind in midwinter.</p>
<p>Although there is daytime and nighttime irradiation in summer, the ground is still difficult to directly receive heat because of the low angle and the cover of ice and snow. The air temperature is still below the freezing point until the end of June when the accumulated snow melts. The air temperature of the humid ground rises slowly, although the dry land and the objects on the ground can heat up to ten or twenty degrees Celsius, the air temperature is ultimately difficult to exceed four degrees Celsius. According to the results of occasional observations, the average temperature in July near the poles is close to zero degrees, and about four and a half degrees in the Arctic Circle. According to the Soviet expedition in 1937, the average temperature in June of that year was minus two degrees Celsius on the ice block north of 87 degrees north latitude, and the highest record was one degree. The average annual range in the polar region is about 15 to 20 degrees.</p>
<p>(2) Frozen Desert Climate This climate zone is located in the southern boundary of the Arctic Circle, in parts of the Eurasian and North American continents. The sun is weak in winter, so it is extremely cold. The coast of the Arctic Ocean at the northern end is kicked by the sea, so it is not as drastic as the inland. The average temperature of each month from November to April is between negative 18 degrees Celsius and negative 60 degrees. The average annual temperature of Verkhoyansk in northeastern Siberia is only .16C and the average is -05.5. The value of -67.3C measured in a certain observation in January 1892 is the world's lowest temperature record, so it is known as the world's "cold pole" (Cold pole).</p>
<p>Most of the land is frozen all year round, and the accumulated snow does not melt. The ports are frozen, which is no different from the polar regions. The difference is that this climate zone has a cold and short summer that is sufficient for plant growth. The average temperature is slightly lower than 10. C. At noon in July and August, the temperature can reach as high as 25 to 38 degrees Celsius. At this time, the topsoil within one foot thaws, the accumulated snow on the Xiang Tang slope melts, and the ground is directly heated, so the dry-growing plants rely on it to grow. However, because of the frozen middle and lower layers of soil, and the frequency of strong winds on the ground, both are sufficient to hinder the growth of forests. Therefore, even in the most favorable areas, only shrubs or grasslands can be seen.</p>
<p>(3) Cold Temperate Climate The area within 45 degrees to 66.5 degrees north latitude is collectively referred to as the cold temperate zone and the Wanxi zone in the geographical zone. Due to the location of the Yuan and the different properties of the cold ocean currents, the regional climate is extremely obvious, complex, and changeable. Now, the east and west coasts and the interior of the mainland are described as follows:</p>
<p>A. The west coast of the mainland is located on the windward coast, especially Northwestern Europe, which is also blessed by the Mexican warm current. There is no extreme climate, and the marine climate is extremely obvious. The northwest wind is frequent, and it is warm, humid, and rainy throughout the year, with an annual rainfall of about 2,500 mm. The small annual temperature difference and the autumn rain are its characteristics.</p>
<p>B. The climate changes gradually from the west coast to the interior of the continent. The continental climate is gradually becoming obvious. Taking the temperature of Semipatinsk between Siberia and Central Asia as an example, the average monthly temperature in that area from November to March is below zero degrees, the ground is covered with snow, and the river is frozen. The coldest month is January, which is close to negative ten degrees. The summer is quite warm, and the average monthly temperature exceeds 15 degrees for about three months, and the annual temperature difference reaches 40 degrees. The transition seasons in the entire region are very short, the autumn is dry, and there is more rain in the spring and early summer. With the melting of ice and snow, there are often floods. The lower reaches of the Dong river are all at the northern end, and the riverbed in the lower reaches is still frozen at this time. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Acute Plutonium Disease in the Atomic Age</h3>
<p>— Hui Shi</p>
<p>In today's atomic age, there is another disease called plutonium disease. This disease is named after the toxic atomic bomb element plutonium, which can cause hair to turn gray, damage the liver, or cause slime tumors (Bone cancer). Workers in industries that use atoms to generate power or for other purposes need to take precautions against this new disease, just as workers in old industries need to take precautions against lead, mercury, and other toxic elements.</p>
<p>Although as far as we know today, no human beings have contracted this disease, its impact on animals has been proven to exist by experiments. Acute common symptoms are similar to those of the entire human body being radiated by X-rays or radium. The spleen shrinks and the liver is severely damaged. When this chemical enters the blood, it first concentrates in the liver and spleen, and then enters the bones. A year after plutonium invades the skin, the area of invasion will swell, hair will fall out, tumors will rise, and the symptoms of limb injury will be serious.</p>
<h3>Radar Blind Landing</h3>
<p>— Wan Gongyu</p>
<p>Using radar to help airplanes land blindly has reached an important stage of testing. The U.S. Civil Aeronautics Administration is testing a radar blind landing program called G.G.A (Ground Controlled Approach), which uses radar on the ground to measure the position of the aircraft and then tells it how to descend.</p>
<p>This method was invented by MIT. During the war, the Air Force used it to safely land aircraft in adverse weather conditions, achieving great success. At the airfield, a fixed towing vehicle equipped with G.G.A radar emits a rotating searchlight beam that can detect aircraft within 20 miles in any weather. When an aircraft enters this range, the operator sees it on the radar display and "calls" it down, using radio to instruct it to fly towards the airspace above the airfield.</p>
<p>When the aircraft flies within ten miles, two more radars begin to operate. One indicates altitude and rate of descent; the other indicates direction and distance. The operator can see a greatly magnified radar image, on which he can distinguish even the slightest deviations from the glide path, broadcasting clear instructions to the blind aircraft's pilot to guide it to landing.</p>
<p>The future use of G.G.A seems to be to help aircraft that cannot carry heavy and complex instruments. In commercial aviation, it is at least extremely useful for landing and traffic control. However, all of these conveniences will only be more widely adopted after the current setup, which requires five people to operate and costs $100,000, is simplified.</p>
<p>Science Book Review</p>
<h3>Scientists Fighting for Time</h3>
<p>— Liu Cheng</p>
<p>"Scientists Against Time," by James Phuinne Baxter 3rd, President of Williams College, totaling 488 pages, published by Little Brown &amp; Co., Boston, in November 1946, priced at US$5.</p>
<p>Every time the world goes through a major war, many newly invented weapons appear, such as the tank in World War I, and the rocket, radar, Loran, bombing sights, detonating fuses, and the notorious atomic bomb in this war. They all played a decisive role in the war situation at the time. Indeed, modern warfare is scientific warfare, using the cutting edge of scientific inventions to fight the enemy. Modern warfare determines success or failure in the laboratory rather than on the battlefield. Therefore, during wartime, scientific research progresses rapidly, inventions are numerous, talents are concentrated, and efforts are stepped up, fighting for time to gain the advantage. This is indeed the effect achieved by the scientists of Germany in the early stage and the United States in the later stage during the recently ended World War II.</p>
<p>This book is a comprehensive record of the achievements of military scientific research in the United States in the short four years of this war. It can also be said to be a part of history. The author is a historian who served in the Office of Scientific Research and Development during the war. He is very familiar with the organization, research, development, achievements, and application of wartime science in the United States. Furthermore, due to his position, he had contact with military and political leaders and government heads. Therefore, everything he discusses is detailed and reliable, as if counting his own treasures. Before the end of the war, everything was a military secret; after peace and victory, it became the history of science.</p>
<p>The book is divided into six major parts, totaling twenty-eight chapters, with four appendices and seventy-four illustrations. It first discusses the competition for the advantage of new weapons, then discusses various types and designs of new weapons, then chemical warfare, then military medicine, then the application of psychology in war, and finally the atomic bomb. The overall mobilization of scientific talents and scientific institutions, scientific research on strategy, land warfare, naval warfare, submarine warfare, and amphibious warfare are all discussed separately, with the sole purpose of fighting for time to defeat the enemy. The weapons used include newly invented radar, Loran, rockets, and various shells, explosives, smokescreens, camouflage, incendiary bombs, and flamethrowers, all of which are described in terms of their invention process and the effects of their use. As for the medical field, such as malaria prevention, blood transfusions and blood substitutes, penicillin, insecticides, rodenticides, D.D.T, and research on aviation medicine, are all discussed in detail. Finally, the book elaborates on the research, invention, and manufacturing process of the atomic bomb, the circumstances of the test, and the effects of its detonation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, describing everything systematically and methodically. The breadth of aspects and scope makes it difficult for someone who has not experienced it and is not rich in experience to complete this book.</p>
<p>In conclusion, after reading this book, we will obtain many novel scientific and military knowledge. Moreover, we can draw the following conclusions: First, far-sighted people in the United States knew, even before the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, that war was becoming increasingly urgent and that the United States would inevitably be drawn into the vortex. Therefore, in 1942, under the wise insight of the late President Roosevelt, the Office of Scientific Research and Development was first established, with the famous scientist Dr. Vannevar Bush in charge, with the task of researching new weapons and national defense science in preparation for any eventuality. Second, scientific mobilization was implemented, and scientific experts and technical personnel from universities, research institutes, factories, and military departments were all adjusted and assigned to their original positions to perform designated tasks. Contracted work was also used to focus on specific problems, ensuring that people were used to their full potential and resources were used effectively. A tight organization, stepped-up efforts, timed assessments, and continuing work led to great success. Third, modern warfare is an adventure in which the fate of the nation is at stake, concentrating all of the nation's manpower, materials, and financial resources on one single throw of the dice. Fortunately, victory was achieved, but the nation's vitality was also greatly damaged. Defeat would mean national extinction and the destruction of the race, which would be even more unthinkable. If atomic bombs are used indiscriminately and without restraint, they could destroy civilization and more. Hoping to end war with war, it is hoped that this will be the last world war. Fourth, the progress in medicine during this war, such as the invention of penicillin, saved more lives than were killed in the war. Fifth, the research, invention, and manufacture of the atomic bomb not only represent a tremendous advancement in science but also demonstrate the greatest success of mankind through the combined efforts of scientists, engineers, industrialists, and even workers. As for the clarity of the book's writing and the beauty of its illustrations, these are secondary matters and need not be discussed further.</p>
