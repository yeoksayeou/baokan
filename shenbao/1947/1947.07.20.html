<p>〔本報北平十九日電〕陳總長主特下，北平十九日夜間有重要軍政會議，冀·熱·察軍政大員齊集北平，繼熊式輝·劉多基·杜建時·上官雲相之後，除傳作義與陳總長偕來外，孫連仲及熱省綏靖區司令石覺，十九日皆奉召專機由防地來平與會。又熊式輝定廿日飛返潘。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕孫立人升任陸軍副總司令後，負責後方兵團訓練事宜，短期內不致赴東北。孫氏語記者。「余就任斯職，深感責任重大，然軍人必須服從命令，推有秉承中央意旨，配合全譯總動員令，悉力以赴，爲國盡忠。至於目前局勢，已日趨明朗化，共匪之迷信武力，出賣國家民族，實屬罪無可逭，其「多作璧必自斃」之命運，早經注定，語云「得人者昌失人者亡」，共匪之前途，已無庸吾等贅言矣』。</p>

<h3>各地人民團體　今開戡亂大會</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕首都各界戡亂救國大會籌備委會，定廿日晨八時假國民大會堂舉行「截亂救國大會」，如廿日遇大雨，則順延二日。此次大會係各界民衆團體一致要求擁護政府肅淸統一陣碍之表示，會後並將遊行</p>
<p>〔本報漢口十九日電〕漢市商會，工會等十一個人民團體，爲響應首都戡亂救國運動，定廿日晨舉行「擁護戡亂救國運動大會。」</p>

<h3>東北唯一大港　葫蘆島現狀</h3>
<p>〔中央社葫蘆島十九日電〕葫蘆島爲今日東北唯一最大港口，其地位重於營口，次於旅大，然旅大尙未接收，故目前東北僅葫蘆島與營口二港，可供海運。勞軍團一行，今日上午抵此。記者放目縱覽，該島斜峙渤海之中，海天無涯，綠水靑山，相互映糧。港口有碼頭六座，可泊萬噸以上輪隻，第一碼頭曾被共匪破壞，正興工修理。據港務局副局長朱重光稱，修理工程需費四百億，年內可望完工，現經該港出入之物資極爲有限，遝入者一部分爲資源委員會器材，運出者爲該會阜新煤礦之煤，四月份計二萬噸，五月已跌爲七千餘噸，海關收入月約六千萬，幾全部爲國營事業稅收。島上現有居民四千五百餘人，商店五十餘家。慰勞團今在此舉行慰勞會，首向港口司令何世禮獻旗，並邀約各界舉行座談會。港口人士僉認本港亟應加以利用。據稱：該港碼頭設備完善，吃水二十八呎，可同時停靠萬噸以上之自由輪五艘及三至五千噸船七艘，現駛東北船隻，多泊秦皇島，但該港因開灤煤擁擠，往來船常須在海外下錨，不如逕駛葫蘆鳥，可省一段鐵路運輸。又葫蘆港倉庫容量甚大，可資利用，且錦葫路支綫直駛碼頭，起卸極爲方便。</p>
<h3>豫鄂區慰勞團　任務完成返京</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕豫鄂區慰勞團劉文島等一行，十九午由漢乘江泰輪返抵京。該團於上月二十四日由京出發，歷經徐州。商邱。開封。鄭州·新鄕·古榮·漢口等地·曾舉行慰勞大會六次，座談會及小組會談多次，對前方民心士氣，裨益良多。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕杜聿明出國手續，現正在京辦理中，三四日可辦妥。又聞，杜曾有一函託陳總長轉陳主席。</p>
<h3>官吏在轄境內　參加立委競選</h3>
<p>本月廿日前應請辭</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕據選舉總事務所訊，依立法院立委選舉罷免法第十三條規定，「現任文職或軍職之官吏，於其管轄區或任所所在地之選舉區為候選人者，應於於選舉期前五個月辭職」，所謂「選舉期前」，經選舉總事務所釋明，即係投票日以前。現立委選舉投票日期已由總選所規定爲十二月廿一日至廿三日，自十二月廿一日向前推算至七月廿日爲五個月，故凡依法應受限制之官吏，倘欲競選立委，務須在本月廿日以前提出辭職，一至廿一日，即爲喪失時效，將無法參加本屆立委之競選矣。</p>
<h3>經濟改革方案　內容刪改頗多</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕經濟改革方案，業經全國經委會綜合小組多次審查，即可整理就緒，並向二十一日舉行之大會提出。聞主要修正處爲將「糧食」項歸入「農業」項，「引導游資納入正軌」項歸入「物價」項，「公敎人員待遇改良」一部歸入「物價」，一部爲政治問題則予刪去。經一再刪改後，較原案簡單多多。</p>

<h3>張東蓀談時局</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕張東蓀抵滬後，記者曾往訪。張氏對黨派間事，不願多談。對國內時局，認爲過去協商和平之機會一再失去，故演成今日局面。目前協商之路綫固斷，但未必永久斷絕。二次大戰之後，各國均有戰後問題，且有國際因素存在，一時難以解決。世界已分裂爲兩，美，蘇均忙於鞏固自身之勢力圈，兩國之間無協調可能，但在相當時期亦不致以兵戒相見。在此局面之下，夾縫中之國家最爲痛苦，我國即爲受害者之一。以美國之態度而論，原則上爲支持國民政府，但如何協助，則爲另一問題。魏德邁將軍此次來華，當亦爲解決此問題。</p>
<h3>豫北武陟被陷</h3>
<p>〔中央社鄭州十九日電〕豫北武陟十八日上午八時許被共匪攻陷。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕魏德邁將軍一行，將於廿二日下午四時在京大較塲機塲着陸。魏氏在京逗留時日，至多不過兩週，原定以海寗路五號美軍事顧問團辦公處爲其居處，茲爲避免魯克斯將軍遷居，且爲便利與司使隨時晤談計，己決定改至上海路八十四號美大使官邸。司使及所屬人員，連日均甚忙碌，對魏將軍在京活動及將約見之人物，已大致作一計劃，惟確定之節目，尙須俟魏本人抵此後再作規定。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十八日電〕據霍華德系報駐日特派員來訊，美國已擬就一且發生事變時撤退留居中國與朝鮮美人之秘密計劃。美國鑒於中國情勢之日趨惡劣，美蘇聯合委員會在朝鮮又陷於僵局，遠東美海陸軍諸高級領袖已擬就一項計劃，可迅速撤退留居中國或朝鮮之美人，大部份以空運爲主。據稱，遠東美空軍可於三十日之內自東方任何地區，撤離美人數十萬名云。</p>

<p>〔本報北平十九日電〕平津敎育界實業界名流組織之市民自治促進會，今在平成立。胡適一再聲明：「此組織非全國性政黨，亦非地方性政黨，只是一般有職業的公民的業餘集會。我們想不時聚在一起，談談地方公益事業，研究改革方案。我們大家對市民自治發生興趣，訓練我們自己作一點促進地方民治的工作」。該會成立大會於今下午四時在歐美同學會舉行。天津會員十餘人亦均趕來參加，出席會員共六十餘人，大會由胡適。梅貽琦·張伯苓任主席團。胡適首致開會詞，略稱：「我們認定民主政治的學習與訓練，必須從我們自己最關切的社會做起。我們平津兩市的公民，希望從兩市的自治工作內開始我們民主生活的學習與訓練。都市的人應該認淸都市的重要性，利用都市的優越條件，征服都市的特殊困難，共同爲都市作一點事」。繼解釋該會任務爲：（一）調查市政與市民生活。（二）研究市民自治法或市憲章草案，供全國上下參考。（三）討論有關市政與市民權利問題。（四）學習訓練民主生活，參加各種公益事業，俾促政治，經濟改善。張伯苓繼起致詞稱：「過去我們迷信敎管救國，結果政治的不斷動盪，把我們辦敎育的全都摧毀了。所以近九十天，我有個大覺悟，即政治不穩定，一切都作不好。現在大家都自動的來參加這個會，足見長時間的敎訓，已使大家有了普遍的覺悟。張氏最後亦稱，該會非黨的組織，謹希望對全國國民有敎育價値。李燭塵“胡先　，亦曾先後致詞，末討論簡章，宣言及提案，並進行選舉。</p>

<h3>蒲立德週內來滬　轉京後訪問東北</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕生活雜誌上海辦事處訊：美前任駐蘇大使蒲立德，將於本週內離日來滬。蒲氏在華擬逗留一週，除決定赴京一行外，其餘考察計劃，包括東北及華北之訪問，扮滬後方能確定。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十八日電〕霍華特系報外交記者西姆斯十八日撰文稱，在「鐵幕」後有　富經騐之歐洲外交家，認爲蘇聯之決意抵制巴黎會議，乃表示蘇聯不但在滿洲並將在亞洲施行更多妙計之謂。蘇聯旣決意分裂世界，此後目標所在將儘量擴展領土。蘇聯亦知在長時期之後，遠集對美國較歐洲更爲重要。遠東對於蘇聯之重要性亦有過無不及。蘇聯行動之次序，將爲東九省，內蒙古，新疆，華北，越南，荷屬東印度，朝鮮，以至於印度。</p>

<h3>前日關東軍一批　仍逍遙中韓邊境　對我政府招降未致答覆</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十九日電〕前日本關東軍五萬人，刻仍這遙於朝鮮與我國東北邊境交界處之長白山。此係自我國東北遺送歸國日本人民所傳出之消息。彼等稱：彼輩日軍，對中國政府之投降要求，未致答覆。據稱：日關東軍之殘餘部隊，配備均極精良，防務鞏固，給養亦佳。據這歸日僑菊順次郞稱：前日本關東軍官兵四萬人，及中韓邊境敦化之日難民一萬八，於日本投降時，曾開赴長白山。彼等均全副武裝，携帶馬匹五千頭及備充二年之用之糧食與彈藥，在深山構築防禦工事，並開掘山洞，全體人馬分組布防，每組二千人，組與組間相距五英里，以無綫電担任聯絡。中國政府軍隊，於一九四六年十一月二日進入敦化時，曾以無綫電通知山中之日軍出山投隊，惟日軍對中國政府之通知未致答覆。旋中國政府軍隊因受中共軍隊之壓力，乃退出敦化，故外界與該神秘軍隊之聯絡乃吿中斷。又稱：今年四月該神秘軍隊似發生糧食恐慌，惟渠拒絕洩露該軍隊之活動情形及其是否會參加共匪軍隊。</p>

<h3>北塔山事件真相　參戰飛機確有紅星番號　當地酋長之子目擊其事</h3>
<p>〔聯合社迪化十七日電〕北塔山卡柴克族酋長巴圖之子契勒齊馬，爲一騎兵，現年廿六歲，今日向聯合社記者談稱：本月五日曾目擊外蒙古飛機三架於兩小時半中，向北塔山投擲炸彈十三枚，卡柴克兵一名及馬十餘匹被炸斃。外蒙飛機一架被卡柴克兵以機關槍擊落，係一雙引擎飛機，上有紅星番號。當時敵機係掩護步兵二百名與卡柴克兵一百名作戰。外蒙軍指揮官薩格米上校被手榴彈擊傷，旋即被俘槍決。其人佩有蘇聯動章，獎其抗日成功。卡柴克兵鹵獲敵方戰利品中，有蘇式與德式輕機關槍十五挺，彈藥三萬發，手榴彈七十枚，金章四塊，上有史達林側像浮彫，並有蒙古文之作戰命令，係蒙古人民共和國總理卓巴仁所發，着薩克米所部佔據北塔山。其他戰利品中尙有史達林與卓巴仁之照片。契勒齊馬一行，於本月六日即衝突後之次日，前來迪化向當局報吿。此種報吿已由迪化中國車事當局證實，據謂七月五日之事件。僅爲許多類似小衝突之一。據西北行園主任張治中吿聯合社記者稱，北塔山形勢現已沉寂。</p>
<h3>新疆叛徒破壞和平</h3>
<p>〔聯合社迪化十九日電〕新疆地廣人稀，面積逾六十萬方哩，人儲僅一百二十萬，其地十分之三，現在叛黨領袖阿合買提江控制下。而此十分之三，正爲全省糧食礦產最富饒之區域，以伊犁，塔城，阿山爲中心，前二區與蘇聯接壤，阿山區則與外蒙毘連。此次叛亂之起源，尙在一九四四年十一月七日，發生於伊犁區城，經過一年以上之戰爭，始於去年七月在迪化簽訂和平協定。惟中國當局並未能控制叛變區域，華人亦不能進入區內。阿合買提江自稱並非分裂派，　謀革新政治，一旦實行，將完全尊重中國主權。中國當局則指阿合買提江欲另建親蘇省政府，一年以來並未遵守協定，亦且無意遵守。叛徒攻擊新疆與外間聯絡之公路，亂事己漸見蔓延，並堅求撤換新任省主席麥斯武德。</p>

<h3>蘇聯反對美國建議　對日和會勢難召開　我將於適當時期表明態度</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十九日廣播：由於蘇聯之反對，十一國對日和會初步會議已無法在下月開始舉行。華盛頓官方對於會議之如期舉行，已表示放棄希望。同時，英方亦已主張延期。</p>
<p>蘇聯致美大使館今日向美國務院提出抗議，據稱：「美助理國務卿希爾特林向外表示，渠會於十一日與邋東委員會其他十個會員國之使館人員會商各該國參加對日和約問題，此稅不確，蓋蘇聯使館人員旣未被邀，亦米參加此項會談也。」</p>
<p>又訊：美政府頃答復蘇聯之指訴。據稱：七月十一日美助理國務卿與遠委會各國外交代表趺話，蘇方代青亦在被邀之列，但未出席參加耳。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕關係人士稱：對於美國建議召開對日初步和會之邀請，我方將於適當時機，提出正式答覆，並同時發表聲明，以表白我國態度。據悉：四強否決權之事實存在，使表決方式，將爲會議能否圓滿開幕之決定性要件之一，綠蘇聨主張先召開外長會議，美國則主十一國逕行集會，並擬採三分二多數表決，雙方距離頗大。我國爲朮對日和約早日商很結果，可能己典關係國家就此點交換意見。又聞我方將建議之折中表決方式，爲採三分二多數表決制，而此三分二多數中，必須包括四强在內。對開會日期，我無成見，惟盼於十一國均能參加前提下，儘早開會。至若蘇聯拒絕參加後，我國對於在東北損失之日僞工業設備及物資之補償閒題，外部亦在研究中。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十八日電〕關於美國希望於八月十九日開始進行對日初步和會一事，英國今日已提出一反建議，要朮予以展期，幷主張應由四强外長親率各該國之代表團。據國務院稱：英國現提出一正式備忘錄，內稱：因英國聯邦已定於八月廿六日在康白拉進行會議，故反對在八月十九日召開對日和會初步會議。據悉：遠東委，會十一國委員中，僅荷蘭已無條件接受美國之建議，澳大利亞與紐西蘭皆與英國持同樣之立塲，蘇聯對此則尚未答覆。</p>
<p>〔合衆社舊金山十九日電〕舊金山市商會十九日致電國務卿馬歇爾，要求在此舉行對日和會。據談：該地在戰期內爲參戰人員及供應物資出發前綫之大港，故該商會認爲在此簽訂和約非常適當。</p>
<h3>日本問題專家談　對日和會方式　如依美主張於我不利</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕某“本問題專家頃對記者談稱：對日和會之召開，有三種方式，即（一）由中英美蘇四國召開，（二）由遠東委員會十一國召開，及（三）目前美國主張之方式，由與會國家三分之二多數表決。在第一種方式下，我國有四分之一之發言權，並擁有否決權。在第二種方式下，我國僅有十一分之一之發言權，但亦有否決權。在最後一種方式下，我國己無否決之權力，英國可因屬地之支持而提高發言力量，我國之發言權名存實亡。在對日和約中，我國與美國之利益並不一致，故對此方式問題不容忽視。以和約之本身而論，過去我國注意兩點：一爲日本之軍事力量澈底剷除，使不致成爲我國及世界之威脅；二爲日本政治之民主化，但並不主張採取報復主義。將來對日和約中之軍事條款，因聯合國目標一致，易於做到；政治民主亦可逐步實現。但過去我國朝野對日本之經濟部門，研究太少，至今尚無精確詳盡之資料，可作爲決策之參考。以中日商務而論，當就商品之性質詳加分析，然後決定是否輸入，以求彼此有利。籠統的拒絕通商，在今日之時局中，已爲不切實際之辦法。就遠東整個局勢而論，韓國之情勢頗値得重視，如美蘇在朝鮮談判上決裂，遠東之壁壘將更爲分明。目前美國之外交政策，爲戰略指導政策，中國·日本·韓國爲東方戰綫上之一環，魏德邁之來，亦可由比角度觀察。</p>
<h3>胡佛在眾院談話</h3>
<p>主美與德日單獨議和</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十八日電〕美國前總統胡佛，頃向衆院撥款委員會談稱：美國與日本單獨議和，可較德國爲易，但對於朝鮮，則或需再予以監督廿五年。蘇聯旣阻碍歐洲之進展，且亦妨碍朝鮮之統一，余主張美國應與德國單獨議和，俾可减輕納稅人對扶養德人及佔領軍費之負担，總之，蘇聯現行態度一日不見其改變，則永無解決之期，故否人對於朝鮮問題，倘蘇聯一日佔領韓北，則吾人應力使韓南自少維持云</p>
<h3>羅家倫在印演講　中國人生觀</h3>
<p>〔中央社新德里十八日電〕我駐印大使羅家倫，昨夜於輪車社宴會中發表關於中國人生觀之演說，並答覆關於我國現代社會問題之多種詢問。發問人士對我國之哲學及生活，咸感興趣，且曾一致指出中印兩方觀點之相同，彼此在文化上應有更密切接觸之必要。羅大使之演說，極爲問潔淸晰，聽衆咸爲動容。渠謂：「中國人民大體而言，均傾向政治中庸，而喜好逐步改革之進化過程」。渠深望「吾等全球人士，將來能運用智慧，創造一種具有印度紡麓之一切優點之文明。（按紡麓爲印度婦女所披之衣如穿之得法，則姿態典禮，至為舒服。）而非一　　小至令人搬息的服裝之文明，此種　　，賞使生活這受束縛，終將演成慘劇」·</p>

<h3>星期論壇　注視新疆的民族文化！</h3>
<p>— 朱應鵬</p>
<p>新疆遭甫經脫離社國未滿兩年之外蒙軍隊侵入，舉國爲之震驚，而最近消息，伊犁方面的叛離運動，更有在喀什噶爾蔓延之勢，伊犁民衆多入蘇籍，蘇工人在新疆邊區開礦；迪化情勢緊張，常有恐怖行動。這一串連續不斷的惡耗，愈使國人爲之担憂。</p>
<p>新　問題的糾結，最初起因於民族問文化的不同，不能彼此了解，而發生障碍。加以歷來主持政治者處理不善，即不免發生爭執。不幸被外來的勢力所脅誘，一般意志不定，目光不遠，好爲輕舉妄動之徒，即易墮其術中，受其利用而不自覺。故叛離運動，較土地之被侵佔，更屬可慮。履霜堅冰，國人自應特別注意，而桑土綢繆，尤爲當前之急務。此其責任，不僅在政府一方面，必須人民起來，共同分担。關於內政外交及軍事的應付，乃政府之責，姑置不談。站在人民立塲，當以加强內地與當地民族間的團結爲第一要義。換言之，就是彼此覓取密切約連繫，由互相了解，互相提携，而達到完全融洽，如手如足，不可分離。</p>
<p>民間的連絡，物質上爲經濟，精神上爲文化。過去期間，內地與新疆雙方人民，素極　膜。勝利以後，新疆省政，雖已趨於革新，而因交通的不便，雙方經濟的交流，一時尚無從談起。現在急須進行，不可再緩的工作，當爲文化的交換。原來，文化爲政治的先導，政治不能離開文化的根據。新疆地方的文化，與內地逈異。我們從歷史，地理，民族，宗敎等各種方面去觀察，知其關係，非常重要。這不但是國內民族團結的試金石，而且對於整個亞洲局勢，以及未來世界宗敎文明可能發生的影響，尤値得重視。我們要帮助政府在行政上有四平八穩，可大可久的措置，要帮助新疆人民，準備保衛國土，應付未來局勢，必須先對新疆文化，有深切的認識。同時使新疆人民對於內地文化，亦有深切的認識。</p>
<p>說到新疆文化，漢唐時期之一階段，已成陳迹，莫可再追。就近世而言，不得不首先提到維吾爾族。維族現爲新省人數最多的一族。約計三百萬人，（包括塔蘭奇）依全省人口百分之七十。故在新省地位，實居首要。次之爲哈薩克族，人口約計四十萬。前者爲「居國」的代表，後者爲「行國」的代表。</p>
<p>維吾爾族即古之回紇。在北宋時，其後裔率其他突厥人，佔領新疆及整個中央亞細亞，建立喀拉汗大帝國，都於今之喀什噶爾。文治武功，彪炳一時。繼阿拉伯帝國之後，爲中亞的文化領導國家。今日之土耳其—即突厥，其時尚不過爲極西的一小部落而已。其文化維持悠久，以迄於今，並不受政治變遷的影響。至於薩克族，則爲世界最優良的騎士，是遊牧牧民族的典型。其他各族如烏孜貝克，塔吉克，柯爾克孜，　　等等（人口合計十五萬人（其文化皆屬於同一體系。故新疆各族，在政治方面，原是中華民族的一體，而其文化，則被稱突厥伊斯蘭文化。其宗敎屬伊斯　，其語言屬突厥系，其風俗習慣，則兩兼之。</p>
<p>突厥伊斯蘭文化的中心國家，過去是維吾爾族建立的喀拉汗帝國，現在是土耳其共和國。屬於突厥—即土耳其語系的國家及民族，除土耳其及我新疆各族外，尚有蘇聯境內之巴希幾爾，韃靼，克里米亞三自治邦，及哈薩克，烏孜貝克，柯爾克孜，塔吉斯坦，亞塞爾拜然，土可曼六共和邦。以上九邦，因附屬於蘇聯，除語言及一部分習俗仍保留外，其他一切，已受社會主義化，原來的伊斯蘭文化，並無活動的餘地了。</p>
<p>現在新疆局勢，即爲三大力量的交錯地。其一，是國民政府行使的政治權力；其二，是本省人民的突厥伊斯蘭文化，及其突厥語系民族運動，即建立突厥語系民族自治的理想；其三，是鄰國蘇聯的勢力，及其支持下的東土耳其斯坦叛離運動。今日蘇聯所屬突厥語系九邦，與新省突厥語系各族的血統及文化，原來是一家。其中哈薩克，烏孜貝克，柯爾克孜，塔吉斯坦，土可曼五邦，人口合計不下一千五百萬，土壤又與新省相接。報載蘇聯當局所稱「伊犁人民之入蘇籍者，原屬蘇聯人民」之言，値得深思。反之，我們是否可以說蘇聯所屬五邦的人民原屬中國人民呢？新疆情形旣如此錯雜，則應付之際，失之毫　，差以千里。反之，則環境雖複雜，亦未嘗不可求得有利的途徑。事在人爲，明眼者必能體會而得之。</p>
<p>突厥語系民族自治運動的由來，是起於新省各族靑年，受「泛土耳其運動」的影響，對於現代政治的建立，　有理想。維吾爾族之外，特別是哈薩克族的領導份子，對現代政洽建設的期望，及其對民族團結的情緒，較爲懇至。他們目覩鄰近的蘇聯所屬突厥語系各邦之有現代建設，雖不免懷欣羨之情，而量力度勢，又未嘗不懍然於附庸的悲哀。對於中央政府，雅不失其親附之心，而過去省政敗壞的反感，一時尚不易消除。尤因政府對於新省固有的文化及其新生的理想，缺乏認識，而感到維護扶助之不足。這便是新疆問題眞正關鍵之所在。</p>
<p>現在政府對新省政治的指導原則，大概是接受張治中將軍的建議，以實行民主化，現代化，並尊重其固有文化爲先務。這原是賢明的措置，値得稱頌的。我們旣知道新疆政治的重點在文化。則從民族團結方面設想，便覺得單憑政府的力量加意維護，其效　還是表面的，暫時的。必須雙方人民共同努力，使新疆文化與內地文化相互交流，相互發揚，由文化的聯絡而產生民族間痛癢相關，憂樂相共的情緒，方能達到永不分離的</p>
<p>維吾爾族的文化，旣曾居中亞領導地位，現在仍不失爲突厥伊斯蘭系各族中文化最古的一族。我們自不書存絲毫優劣之見，宜生愛護之心。尤不宜蹈襲前人强求溪化的講誤觀念，誤　目標。我們對於哈薩克族，更應有進一步的認識，淸除從前一切荒唐的誤解。現在新疆靑年滯跡於京滬者，不下百除人，大都為有志之士。其中有政論家，有詩人，有小說家，有史地學者，有曾留學蘇聯或土耳其而具有高深學問的專家。他們並在京滬出版突厥語系的雜誌多種，其發行範圍，遠及中東，印度，及埃及。其內容充滿民族意識及現代思想。這種情形，似尚未爲此間社會所注意。至於新疆漢人方面，在張治中將軍主政時期，由研究新疆問題專家黃震遐君，在迪化主持成立新疆史地學會，以溝通漢回文化，融和感情爲示旨。當地文化人士參加者不少。黃君近又來滬，與旅滬新疆人士，共同發起新疆文化出版社。已出版者有新疆文化畫刋一種，介紹新疆風土及文藝。在編著中者，以「新疆史綱」尤爲重要。</p>
<p>上海為國內文化的中心，社會人士之關心新疆，或對於突厥伊斯蘭文化具脊興趣者，應各盡國民一份子之天職，急起直追，會同旅居京滬的新疆靑年，成立一文化交換的組織，與新疆方面的文化團體，最得連絡，彼此作文化的交換。其初步工作，當爲：（一）雙方組織文化訪間團，互相觀光，並准許學校靑年，工商人士共同參加；（二）上海各大學內，延聘專家，及新疆學者，設立新疆問題及其史地文化的講座；。彼此翻譯文化上的　本書絡及現代著作；（四）出版介紹雙方文化的書報；（五）雙方交換舉行繪畫，音樂，舞蹈，攝影，戲劇及電影之展覽及表演；（六）攝製雙方風土名勝人物的電影；（七）聯合雙方學者成立史地語文藝術宗教等各種學術性的考察團體。我們要推動雙方文化的發展，加強民族的團結，這是最低限度的要求。筆者懇切希望，上海社會領袖，及熱心人士，及早發起，努力進行。</p>
<p>最後，附帶的有一個重要意見，即現在突厥伊斯蘭文化的中心國家，是土耳其共和國。我國與土耳其的邦交，素極友好。土耳其的復興經過，足為我們良好的借鑑，加以現土耳其所處國際環境，尤與我國相彷彿。由於對新疆文化工作的推進，我們同時必須對土耳其，謀取文化上的連絡。最好能更進一步，組織中土文化協會，以加深兩國文件交流通訊兩國人民間友誼的增進。此在應付中亞方面的局勢，雙方均有莫大的裨益。尤願政府當局注意及之。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕衆院昨夜在希臘戰訊頗傳，且蘇聯與西方各國裂痕擴大聲中，核准對外撥款十六億三百十九萬九千九百美元，以支持美國外交政策。計開：（一）撥助希臘與土耳其四億美元，（二）救濟中國·奧地利·義太利及特里埃斯特自由區等三億三千二百萬美元；（三）日本·朝鮮及德國等佔領膩美軍政府經費五億五千萬美元；（四）捐贈國際難民機構基金七千一百零二萬四千美元。</p>

<h3>美國會重提減稅法案　杜魯門再予否決　參院複議後已表示接受</h3>

<p>政府收入減少影響援歐計劃</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十八杜魯門總統致國會聲明否決减稅法案之咨文有謂：所得稅之减少，將影響馬歇爾援歐計劃下美國應負担之義務，而美國對於國際復興所負之責任，與美國獲取持久和平之努力，亦具有重大關係。最近若干國家拒絕參與建立世界安定局勢之共同努力，使美國之在務益形艱巨，殊不宜削减政府之收入，妨碍政府履行其義務之能力。就减稅之性質言，旣屬錯誤，就减稅之時間言，尤覺不當。美國刻尙負有因戰爭而產生之重天義務，國防支出需費浩大，而決算敬有盈餘，亦應首先用以拔還公債。</p>
<p>美國繁榮空前不宜刺激物價</p>
<p>概減稅案，匪特代表不完善之稅則政策，且足助長通貨膨脹之壓力。在物價未趨穩定，商業就業以及國家收入尙未達到完善水準以前，减稅殊無合理之理由可言。今美國商業活動之一般水準，正續向高峯挺進，就業人數亦繼續增加，六月份就業人數，爲我國歷史上最高之紀錄，此項空前繁榮狀態，尙無衰退之明顯象徵。减稅勢將妨碍爲維特高度繁榮所必需之工資及物價的調整，亦將刺激消費品價格之上漲，而增加衰退之危險。</p>

<h3>救濟米圖利案　學校領得甚微　輾轉流入米店</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於「聯總」救濟米被轉售圖利一案，目前警局所逮捕者尚屬次要人物，據悉：此案牽涉頗大，且偵查費時，警局為審愼起見，須待主要人犯落綱後始允發表。惟據記者獲悉：此項救濟米，原係「聯總」蘇寗分署最近分配予概署轄區內各學校者，總數共三千餘包，每包淨重一百磅，惟實際各學校能領得此項救濟米者，為數數甚微，大部份均輾轉流入京滬區各米店。截至昨日經被捕之人犯供認經手出售之米，已達七百餘包。此案內慕據一般推測，可能由下列三點原因造成：（一）分署職員利用職務上之便利串同各學校當局將上項救濟米予以呑沒預售，（二）各學校當局或領米後扣住　不發，私自出售，（三）各校敎職員於領米後因米質欠佳，併成整數轉售於米店或調換上好白米。至被捕人犯，計鎭江隆茂米行主何俊生，上海宋涇記米行經理宋錫涇，米販李思忠，同泰公記碾米廠主李雲慶等四名。</p>

<h3>慶祝國軍勝利　實行萬元勞軍　理髮師為後代生存計　對影片侮辱誓欲力爭</h3>

<p>焦理事長觀感三點</p>
<p>繼揚屬同鄉會焦理事長鼎鎧發表意見：略謂今天理髮業招待諸位記者本人特就本會立塲與關係，將本人對「假鳳虛鳳」之觀感，爲諸位說明。（一）影片爲一種社會敎育工具，可以普映於國內外各地，或流傳後世，啓示後人之觀感，實有不可思議之潛力與效用，苟在片上對某人或某業，某事，加以汚點，足以引起全國當代人士及國外之觀衆對某人或某業某事之唾駡，如遺傳後世放映，其影響之大，更難想像。（二）國家進行國語敎育，影片公司負有宣傳文化之義務，該片仍採用蘇北俚俗之土語，其原意固在諷刺，然亦僅能博取千百萬觀衆之評笑，殊違背國家對肚敎之施策。（三）無論稗言小說或戲劇，均寓有勸善懲惡之意旨，故歷來行世之書本及戲劇，雖有奸盜邪淫之演述，然結果率使惡者難逃法網，或加以果報，公理，輿論，良心種種之制裁，方符勸懲之旨。今該片僅表演理髮師種種有傷風化之言動，及利用業務上之工具自殺，毫無勸懲之作用，實足啓示該業中人利用工具之動樓，不啻敎唆自殺云云。</p>
<p>誓死力爭免貽後患</p>
<p>最後會中並散發一假鳳虛凰影片侮辱理髮業各點理由書」，認爲是可忍、孰不可忍，爲本身及後代之生存計，全國理髮業同人誓死力爭，務須將此片侮辱各點剪除或修正，免貽無窮之害云云。</p>
<p>掃青碼子四字出典</p>
<p>又昨日會中主人向記者提出要求二項，謂，（一）曾有少數報章，以「掃靑碼子」稱呼我等，查「掃靑碼子」之典故，實爲不祥之詞，如寗波理髪師，爲人剃頭之暇，即作槓棺材抬喜轎生意，因此人皆呼之爲「掃靑碼子」，又監獄人剃頭時，謂之「掃靑」。（二）報上時見稱我等爲「理髮匠」，實則「匠」者，係以原料能製成成品者，理髮業與此不符，故請　　　「匠」。</p>

<h3>考試院意見　博士學位授予　擬由國家統一辦理</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕博士學位評定會組織法及博士學位考試細則兩草案立法原則，經第七次國務會議中討論後，交付政治審查　會審查。該草案中詳細說明博士學位分別爲文學，理學，法學，工學，農學，醫藥等六種，及審查申請人標準等項。茲誌其草案及考試院意見　等如下：「考試院憲見書」：博士學位，各國制度頗不一律，即在一國之內亦有參差不齊。惟以一般而論，國家授與，較之學校授與水準爲高。法國之國家博士，即其一例。日本初用統一評定授與，後改由各大學自行授與，水準較前低落，尤爲明徽。我國學位。依現行學位授予法，旣採學士碩士博士三級制，其最高之傳士一級標準，應特予提高，蓋不待論。顧我國內各大學或獨立學院之研究院所，迄未能均衡設置，復因戰事影響，學術水準又難遽即提高。若逕由各校院自行審定授與，微特博士候選人一時產生不易，即學術標準亦確定爲難。最近二三十年間，不如仍依現行法所定，由國家統一評定授與，較爲得計，况高深之專門研究，未必盡在大學研究院所。尤其近年博學之士頗多，離去大學欲將其研究工作或論文盡歸大學審查或考試，實非所宜。雖所稱「特許收受博士候選人之大學或獨立學院」，其所收受，並不以本校敎授或本校出身者爲限。但學問獨立，各國皆然，學說見解，從難一致，苟聲氣之未同，便應求之不易。是與其由各校之評定，容有韜隱自甘，究不如由國家辦理，當可泯門戶而廣搜求，較足以宏收効。據上理由，博士學位仍應依現行學位授予法之規定，由國家統一考試授與，不必更張。</p>

<h3>解決華北糧食問題　平津滬交換物資</h3>
<p>張嘉璈昨晩晉京報告經過</p>
<p>中央銀行總裁張嘉璈氏，爲解決騫北糧食問題，特於本月十四日由滬飛平轉津，祝察實際情形，並與華北當局切商調節辦法。張氏原接赴東北一行，因奉召赴京，十八日即返抵此閒，昨晚搭軍晋京報告一切。據張氏昨日（十九）在國行接見聯合徵信所記者，據談：此次赴華北，一爲視察分行業務，一爲糧食問題。因華北受共匪刧奪之餘，糧價飛漲，人民生活相當困難，其供應情形，自應詳爲研究，經與平津各長官研究結果，華北每日須糧食八百噸，過去平綏平漢津浦北寗四綫，均爲糧食供給之動脈，目前津浦平漢北寗諸綫，均因戰事中斷，僅平綏可以供給，但數量不大，以致演成嚴重之問題。當經決定，（一）由滬補助華北糧食，（二）華北供給滬方燃料，彼此接濟，互換物資，以期達到安定生活，平抑物價之目的。關於前者，華北希望補助二十萬噸，自七月份起，至本年底爲止，但當地可以收購一部份，將來至少可運十萬噸前往接濟。此項糧食，一半向國外訂購雜糧，因其價格較小麥猶低三分之一，現已開始先運三十萬包麵粉，配給平津公教人員，天津並配給工人平民，待國外訂購之雜糧運到後，再按月供給。關於後者，（１）現開灤煤已積極增產，北寗路亦開始趕運，現有七萬五千噸運秦皇島，本月底可運十三萬噸到滬。本市煤荒，當可解決。幷爲獎勵起見，決定以麵粉八萬包給開灤礦工，四萬包給北寗路工（２）本市缺白煤，決向安南訂購，長城亦可供給一部。至煤球本市約月需六千噸，亦由華北供給。張氏繼述華北金融情形，謂華北金融業，亦感存款增加遲緩之困難。因算碼缺乏，平津兩市銀錢業，已籌設聯合準備庫，同時加做重貼現，華北人民購買力已削弱，商業極爲凋敝。張氏最後談及東北金融問題稱：東北流通劵曾跌至八元五，現爲十一元五角，因關內外可自由匯兌及買賣關係，財政部正計劃統一幣制，將來自有辦法公佈。此次共匪破壞東北後，損失極鉅，能入關之大豆及煤觔，均已無望，關內運出者，以香烟茶葉爲多。</p>
<h3>銀根轉鬆遊資活動　紗布買氣旺盛　塲內喊價俱比上日高漲</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因銀根鬆弛，各方進意活躍，兼有游資參入商市塲中活動，是以做價不乏拉抬，然市上實銷則以零星居多，惟中途以逢高稍有吐售，漲勢較遜。結果四二支藍鳳比上日仍漲三十萬元，爲一千八百萬元。廿支特雙馬漲四十萬，爲一千二百萬元。雙馬紗亦升四十萬，爲一千一百十萬元。其餘四二支寳光水月，四十支金城，卅二支藍鳳銀月，廿支藍鳳人鐘，及十六支光明，十支童子軍等組細紗，一致步挺二三十萬至五六十萬元不等　昨日棉布市况，緣銀根轉鬆，初開塲內補吸頗殷，客帮見低亦來進取，兼有業外參加，致買勢更强，執貨者扳持，行情甚俏，尤以元嗶嘰去化較暢，價比上日步升二萬左右。四君子金印嗶嘰，收價這四十九萬五千元，金蓮妙舞四十七萬六千元，十二磅龍頭細布，在十時許買戶甚多，價哄高至四十五萬三五千元，成交頗暢，比上日續漲一萬七八千元。五福彩球藍鷄陽鶴等各檔細布，亦均挺升一萬餘元至二萬元。白坯漂布粗布，價亦帶昂四五千元至一萬元，其餘色布藍布斜紋及士林布等，市亦堅穩。</p>
<p>又訊：紡建公司昨照例供售棉布，計十二磅五福細布價掛四十萬五千元，太白醉酒元嗶嘰爲四十五萬元，跳鯉元光斜三十五萬五千元，係限傘廠申購。並聞紡建五福細布准購單，有願加價二萬元拖進云，</p>
<h3>食米繼續下挫</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧六千七百餘石，形勢一蹶不振，粳秈元米一致續跌萬元以上。</p>
<p>麵粉零化略動，市勢先疲後緊，結果彷彿。麩皮胃呆少神，依然疲中徘徊。豆餅鄉銷動而不旺，微升千元。營口餅實銷尚佳，步升三四千元。黃豆汕頭轉濃，納胃香燥，本街豆腐去化亦殷，回漲三五千至萬元不一。茶豆堅挺之格，元麥到消兩接，價無變動。</p>
<p>蠶豆來源踵接，消化仍然呆滯，萎麋不振，逐步脩削，再低二三千元。赤豆平正，莞豆紅糧來去兩稀，站平之狀，苞米供求兩少，形趨平穩之勢。生仁粵閩均有納胃，汕頭亦然問津，市勢活靈，回漲萬元。芝蔴來貨漸有，求者稀少，狂跌二三萬元。菜油亦加二三萬元，淸油加二萬元，惟蔴油平平。小麥阜豐福新昨日開出二萬餘包，價格平定之局。</p>

<h3>捲烟挺俏逾恒</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟市况，以國家行局有巨額差出，銀根鬆濫，塲內買氣甚濃，喊價挺俏逾恒。十支大英烟昂至九百二十萬元，成交甚盛，午市結果比上日績漲廿八萬元。老刀亦漲十九萬元，爲七百八十四萬元。</p>
<p>全日趨勢，以頤中公司有暫緩派貨訊，同業在塲搜吸甚勁，在買風熾烈下，市面乃扶搖直上。其中尤以熱門貨漲勢較强，惟聽頭烟因來源頗多，市仍不振。</p>

<p>外股昨亦十分平庸，恰紗晨開七五〇〇〇元，自七六〇〇〇元退至七二五〇〇元結束，洋商及廣帮雖買，證劵帮北帮銀行帮以及散戶都售，結果較前收計會德豐怡　各挫半成弱，業廣墾植尚平，餘股均稍低落。</p>
<h3>大戶爭先出籠　華股跌風甚烈</h3>
<p>華股昨漲勢不能持久，隔前銀行交換差出甚巨，上塲見俏，但業外游資並未被吸引而來，高後轉盤，繼而信和有業中大戶急擬出籠，更形潰敗，回瀉甚慘。美亞等次熱，亦受影饗。因經濟改革方案，將於下週發表，活動者反以銀根恐再抽緊爲慮，斬多終於發動，近午愈形悲觀，不支而竭。除勤興外，咸以低價結束。雜牌股成交不多，尚有衆疲而獨堅者。</p>

<h3>棉市交易活躍</h3>
<p>昨日現棉市况，因市上銀根　動，紗廠頗有吸胃，客帮亦起添辦，同時棉紗收盤趨勢尚堅，故人心樂觀。市上賣氣甚濃，交易較上日盛旺，價格無甚榮辱，脚地似甚穩定。各檔做開送廠價計靈賽二二七萬，沙市二一〇萬至二一八萬，漢細一九七萬，二〇二萬，二一二萬。冲沙市二一二萬，又棧交價計靈寳二一〇萬，二一五萬至二二〇萬，沙市二一〇萬，漢細一九七萬至二〇〇萬，老河口一九七萬至二〇〇萬，火機一七五萬，又下水貨一六五萬，周浦籽花每組三二萬八千。</p>
<h3>染織等五業公會　要求撤銷煤氣限度</h3>
<p>並立即減低額外罰款負擔</p>
<p>本市染織，熱水瓶，鑄字，電燈泡，電工器材等五工業同業公會，爲煤氣公司限制工業煤氣用量度數過低，罰鍰苛刻，不勝痛苦，爰決定聯名推派代表，定廿一日（下星期一）向公用局請願。並列舉理由，請求撤銷限度，俾維工業。其要點如下：</p>
<p>煤氣爲工業必需之燃料，七月份起，價務每一百立方英呎，自一千二百元漲至三千六百元，鮫之電力自來水等其他公用事業，漲率獨高，已失事理之平。其最不合理者，厥爲用量限制過低，超過限度，即以每一百立方英呎三千六百元加五倍罰鍰，使工廠不勝負担。此項限制之由來，起源於淪陷時期，彼時上海自來火公司，在敵僞控制下，爲使煤氣大量供應軍需，遂將民營工業用量限度極度抑低，每廠最低數十度，最高亦不過數百度。此項限度因彼時各業侷處一隅，出品無法遠銷，原有設備，大都停工，該公司即據此爲計算標準。勝利以後，工業復員，設備逐步擴展，用量日益增加，該公司非但不酌量放寬，反仍照過去限制辦法。明知工業在此限度內用量不够，彼不謀增加供應數量，反訂立超過限度之鉅額罰款辦法，此無異變相之加價，實開一切公用事業未有之惡例。七月份加價之後，限度旣不放寬，而罰款又從百分之三百陡增至百分之四百。現各工廠每月用量，均在數十度之間，額外罰款負担，每月總在千萬以上，似此措施，實屬摧殘工業。因各該會員工廠紛紛請求糾正，故請迅予轉飭英商自來火公司，立即撤銷罰款辦法。</p>
<h3>陳祁門暢銷　成交四百餘箱</h3>
<p>抽珍，珍眉等各種外銷綠茶，自貨方鑒於市存不顰，售意轉趨堅化以來，刻下求者雖仍蝟集，猶難隨心所欲，交易依然式微，而過程則穩俏如故。其他花色僅低擋陳紅茶，進戶尚旺，情况屹立有勁。至於內銷花色，客帮各地，因天氣甫晴，去化未見盛熾。他若本街店莊，則仍在絡繹添置中，尤以陳次祁門，成交獨多，竟達四百三十六箱，做開價格一致異常鞏固。茲悉：到滬多日之本年度祁門新紅茶，吐納談判殊爲活躍，惜雙方喊價距離尚多，交易暫難展開云。</p>
<h3>收購陳茶並不強迫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中央信託局息：收購茶葉，分貸款及非貸款二種。貸款部份，四聯總處業已委託該局收購卅五年度陳茶，收購價由中央銀行決定。該局班理收購事宜，牲質並不强迫。故外傳各茶商有將陳茶出售予各洋行事，亦悉聽其便。而該局則仍定自廿五日起，開始接受各茶商申請收購云</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕出口商裝運出口貨物所需包裝材料，准予特許進口辦法，已由輸出推廣委員會呈奉全國經濟委員會核准，一俟該會公告後，即可實施。</p>
<h3>肥皂一致步昂</h3>
<p>昨日用品市面，以天氣放晴，去化轉佳，塲上同業添辦特暢，兼以銀根趨鬆，游資轉向物品，不乏拉提，故最後固本皂昻至五十萬關外，為零五千元，比上日續升九千。箭刀皂猛升一萬五千元，爲四十九萬五千元。其餘祥茂日月光華等皂價，亦一致步漲三五千至八九千元，惟火柴市仍平疲云。</p>
<h3>糖價略見回好</h3>
<p>昨糖市以天氣晴朗，趨勢略見好轉。公會劃盤二〇中砂白爲六十五萬三千元至四萬八千元，升二萬元。四半軍由六十六萬六千元，升六千元。台赤五十六萬五千元，升五千元。二四粗白油包仍六十六萬元，汕提靑四十四萬六千元，棉赤四十八九萬元，計五六十包。海南赤高貨四十六萬五千元，五十包。興化白高貨六十萬〇八千元，普通興赤四十四萬元，計二百數十簍，刁靑零星開四十萬元。</p>

<h3>申請核配外棉　紡調變更辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕按照外棉核配規定，申請核配外棉之紗廠，其紗錠設備，須在三千枚以上。茲紡調會迭據各小型紗廠函請，要求獲取同樣權利。經紡調會核議一過，已決對紗錠設備在三千枚以下，而其設備能仿製二十支以上之棉紗，產品品質列在丁等以上者，自第三季限額外棉起，亦得享受申請核配之權利。刻紡調會已將該項新規定，函六區棉紡公會，轉所屬會員查照云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據中央信託局息：關於本年四月底以前到埠而未能領到許可證之外棉，業經商定由中信局收購。該批外棉，總値約在美金八百萬元之譜，大部係屬各紗廠所有。對於代紡事宜，該局原則上望國民營紗廠均能代紡。如民營紗廠不願代紡，則對申請收購之各廠，至少須代該局代紡半數棉紗，其餘半數，仍由該局委託紡建公司代紡。</p>

<h3>種麥與搶麥　山東「解放區」二三事</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員麗天</p>
<p>濟南十四日航訊</p>
<p>在山東，除了火綫邊　及　軍新收復地區，由於農民逃散未能及時播種致成荒地，或即播種亦被共軍於撤離前將麥苗剷除地區外，在所　山東「解放區」內，今年小春，堪稱豐收。尤其淄博膠東，魯北及沂山山區，據逃出來的難民說：「麥穗低垂欲墜，每一穗的麥子有多至四十餘粒者，南　　過，泛成一片金黃色大海，煞是好看」！「以食爲天」辛苦經年的晨民，正在彼此慶幸着，認爲今年可以不再挨餓了！誰知道，霹靂一聲，共黨「山東省主席」黎玉和『華東人民解放軍司令員」陳毅會銜的十個縱隊曁地方團隊食約十餘萬人，除掉第一綫必留的守衛部隊外，全部義務分調各地協助老百姓搶割新麥。陳毅的機關報「大衆日報」亦如火如茶，每日以大字標出，號召並展開了全面的搶麥運動：搶割，搶打，搶運，搶藏。</p>
<p>「三月存糧」</p>
<p>果然，自六月初起，不出半個月，麥子都收割完了，打晒完了。但是結果呢？第二個跟着來的命令是每家按人口分配，每人每月四十斤，小口减半，各發三月，其餘統由「解放區政府」統一存儲，至於過去所襲用，名目旣繁，收效又微的什麼「慰勞獻糧」，「擴軍獻糧」，「抗屬用糧」，「鬥爭罰糧」等名目，乾脆棄置不用，而所發給人民僅供三月食用的麥子，可得各人自己保管，自己存儲，萬一該地被國軍佔領，發覺或因戰事有所損失，「解放區政府」即再不負任何責任，因此「解放區」人民自己可以把握並有權處理的食糧只是三假月。三月以後怎麼辦呢？「解放區政府」旣操縱了所有人民的食糧，這與控制了所有人民的生命又有什麼兩樣呢？</p>
<p>保飯碗運動</p>
<p>在共軍所到之處，第一件「德政」便是淸算，鬥爭，和「窮人大翻身」，隨着便將鬥爭而來的土地耕牛房屋等實行按口平分。共軍此舉其主要的目的並非有愛於人民，乃藉此爲手段脅迫人民「參軍」而偏偏美其名日「保飯碗運動」或「保田運動」，在共軍巧妙宣傳下人民不參軍就無法保護其旣分得的產業。於是，據手頭尚不完整的五六兩月新華社有關參軍廣播，僅在山東軍區中之冀魯豫軍區十一縣於「分地」後參軍者即達五萬人，審查後送上前綫者三萬七千人，其中百分之八十爲貧農，張昌琪二子二孫二姪六人悉數被征，陽榖縣魏海村七位新婚不久的新郞亦「自動」參軍。壽張縣三月內即有三五〇〇名靑壯年參軍，齊河四千名，昌邑城武各千五百名，聊城五千名，以上約略統計，即已達五萬二千五百名，但則此數字，又豈後方任何一省的徵兵數字所能及得上的呢？</p>
<p>被迫的參軍</p>
<p>共軍兵源就在利用這種保飯碗運動的製造和宣傳下完成的。宣傳之不足，並繼之以利誘；（如利用少女抬轎，扭秧歌，做戲，開歡送大會及减輕參軍者賦稅及攤派等），利誘之不足，並繼之以威迫；（如以批評威迫及增加負担等手段迫使本不願參軍者不得不參軍。）威迫不足時，則更纔之以强征，利用其嚴密的地方組織，以命令方式，依其所欲，强令地方行政機關（如縣，區，村）組織參軍委員會。</p>
<p>民兵的編補</p>
<p>人民被迫參軍後，第一步多爲村民兵，（據統計，山東現有村民兵一一三萬餘人，）原則上不離本土，故人民多易於上當，樂於應征，民兵當一短時期後，視需要即改編入區中隊等單位，其編補程席如下：村民兵　區中隊　縣獨立營　聯防大隊　藝幹部隊　地方兵團　野戰部隊</p>
<p>每一兵員由村民兵向上編補時，愈上級待遇愈優，裝備愈佳，在解放區中亦愈受人尊敬，亦愈「光榮」，因此，一小部人民在不知不覺間，多樂於升補。不僅如此，共軍爲了鼓勵人民於旣參軍後，皆勇於作戰，樂於用命起見，除一般慰勞外，更特別提高並尊重士兵在部隊中的地位，看戲時士兵在前排，官長在後排，宴會時士兵在上席，吃的是水餃饃饃較好的菜蔬，官長在下席，吃的是窩窩頭，小米麪，是蹩脚的菜，尤其在每次奉命作戰前，必定大張筵宴，大吃大喝六七天，揆諸常理，士兵們應該再無問題，樂於效死的了！</p>
<p>送死與逃生</p>
<p>但事實上倒又並不如此簡單，如逢士兵聽到有得大吃大喝了！大部份都不約而同認爲他們的死期也就不遠了！於是消極者自己有意戕害自己身體的局部使成殘軀，或者使病，甚至自殺，積極者便挺而走險，相率向政府控制區逃亡。共軍爲了阻遏此種逃亡「開小差」現象，於是又頒佈了「開小差者殺！」「開小差者新某全家」的最恐怖也量殘酷的法令，民衆除掉被迫爲「中共」「殉葬」「送死」外，別無他途可循，許多徼倖由「解放區」逃出的難民都這樣異口同聲說：『在「解放區」裏，我們老百姓沒有見過一張笑險，即有，也只是屬於中共統治階級的，但可絕不是老百姓！』</p>
<p>山東省政府主席王耀武和民眾在一起，呈現着一片融融洽洽的氣象。　（本報特派員摩天）</p>

<h3>首都文化界　總動員前奏曲</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者丁匡華</p>
<p>南京十五日快訊</p>
<p>張道藩說：「目前的鬥爭不是國共兩黨之爭；而是全國民衆對出賣國家利益的漢奸的勦滅，不是爭黨派間的私益，而且爭國家民族的存亡。任卓宣說：「我們要正視聽今後大家應通稱共匪為「赤色漢奸」「第五縱隊」。</p>
<p>自總動員令頒布以來，京市一切均呈現着「動」的氣教，政界動員了，軍界動員了，工商界動員了，婦女界動員了，昨天又動員了文化界！</p>
<p>昨日下午八時，香舖營中央文化運動委員會內聚滿着京中各文化社團的文化人，熱烈地用嘴和筆商討着文化總動員的事。</p>
<p>會議首先在公餘聯歡社的樓上進行。開會前文化人彼此融融洽洽的談着各人的事業和計劃。獨有一位年靑的大師，大概是佛學會的代表吧，坐在角落裏搖着紙扇，默無一言，精神恍惚游移於入世出世之間，其實抗戰時期，和尚還組得起大刀隊，今天當亦不無貢獻吧。</p>
<p>八時正，會議開始，張道藩先生以地主及文化運動領導人的身份進會，並推監審委員</p>
<p>劉士篤</p>
<p>先生主席。劉先生修美的小鬍子，微笑　就了主席位。　現在時局是澄淸了，和談已成陳跡，劉先生在開會詞中，懇切的重複着說：「今後對運背政府法令及國家的叛徒，必須痛加征剿，文化界同人尤應在暴露匪軍暴行方面，對國內外多加宣傳，在救國理論方面，勤加探討，埋頭苦幹。」音調平和的四川腔裏，滿蓄着激昻氣槪。　接着，張道藩先生站起來致辭</p>
<p>張道藩</p>
<p>先生對演說一門，是向有經驗的，說出來相當輕快。他首先對共匪歷來禍國情形，作了一次淸算，然後作結論說：「我們要認淸目前的鬥爭，不是國共兩黨之爭，而是全國民衆對出賣國家利益的漢奸的剿滅，不是爭黨派間的私益，而是爭國家民族的存亡。」張先生十足的京腔和戲劇性的姿態，不禁令我聯想到他在「密電碼」一片的演說鏡頭，他的這張利嘴就一直隨着革命史在動員着的，這時文化人的心該都爲他的正義之辭震撼了，掌聲响澈了全塲。</p>
<p>在明日如繪的和風裏，新聞界老戰士</p>
<p>許君武</p>
<p>先生打開話匣子來了，他要求文化界內部步調應趨一致，而形式上可各盡所長，他不主張開頭就是「自七七事變以來」的那種抗戰八股，那種是形式上的統一，恰是以往文化界的致命傷。他興奮地說着，留在突出的前額下的陰影裏的一對眼睛，燜烱的發着誠摯的光。（按許先生現主編華夏副刋。）</p>
<p>任卓宣</p>
<p>先生「動」了。他屈居着旁座，不曾爲記者見到。他說：「過去爲和談時代，現在是剿匪時代，如何促醒國人爲思想上及精神上之動員，是文化界同人的責任。」任先生說話非常明快鋒利，有胆識，有見地，不失爲第一流的理論家。全塲的眼光，都向他的灰布長衫和淸癟的面孔注視集中。</p>
<p>知行學社的</p>
<p>陳健夫</p>
<p>先生，軍官訓練團的儲伯恩先生，以及北極閣總編輯王卜一先生繼之發言。王先生的話相當詼諧，他認爲目前電影界美國大腿太多，廣播中議是靡靡之音，戲劇也失之貴族化，不能深入民間。他更指出抗戰勝利，得力於「大刀向鬼子頭上砍去。」而現在人們却爲「不要你，不要你，你是一個壇東西」弄糊塗了。張道藩爲此特作了一番答覆，　各方面努力改進。</p>
<p>這時許君武及陳健夫二位共同提出了一個建議，主張成立首都文化總動員委員會，來經常發動文化動員工作。正名一項，引起了許多意見任卓宣先生主張定名爲「首都戡亂救國文化動員委員會」，鍾榮倉先生主張定名爲「動共敕國文化動員委員會」，另一位主張定名爲「首都文化動匪動員委員會」。各人陳述意見時，均極熱烈，結果張道藩出來打了圓塲，推定任卓宣，胡一賞，許君武，儲伯恩，陳健夫五人爲籌委，商討文化動員組織及工作進行事宜。</p>
<p>主席宣佈散會時，已是夜十時五十五分。</p>
<p>胡一貫</p>
<p>先生接着以召集人資格招呼着其餘的四位籌備委員，準備開夜車繼續商討，熱忱誠可稱佩。</p>
<p>文化界已燃起了戡亂救國的火種，掀起了民族自救的怒濤，當明朝的第一綫臘光照耀這古老多難的國土上時，這呼聲定會響遍遐邇，無數張嘴和無數枝筆定會堅强地武裝起來，參加到反叛亂，反侵略的革命陣營中去。</p>
<h3>廈大新景</h3>
<p>— 艾特</p>
<p>廈門八日航訊</p>
<p>勝利以還，全國上下一致地要求敎育建設，但由於內職所造成的各種破壞，粉粹了我們所預期的效果，使全國敎育仍陷於杌隍不寗的局勢中，而厦大，部祖負起這時代的使命，向着敎育建設的大道邁進！</p>
<p>厦大係剏設於民國十年，創辦人爲華僑鉅子陳嘉庚。陳氏以獨資經營厦大，凡十六年，後因他個人商業失敗，始由政府改爲國立，由藏本棟担任首任國立厦門大學校長。薩氏接任不久，抗日戰事發生，厦門淪陷敵手，校址遷設於長汀。八年間由於薩氏的苦心　劃，以及全校師生的共同努力，校譽蒸蒸日上。獲有「加爾各答以東的第一個大學」的榮譽。勝利後，厦大由長汀遷回厦門，在現任校長汪德　博士主持下，不僅保有厦大過去的優良傳統，且另增添了一片新生的喜悅。</p>
<p>原有校舍，被敵人毀壞大半，復員以後，校方極力修建，至今已大致恢復　觀。校舍高大巍峨，背山面海。加以南國的氣候宜人，常年辦息在綠蔭　中，堪謂富有詩意。</p>
<p>厦大設文·法·理工·商·四院，計分中文，外文·歷史·敎育·經濟·政治·法律（內設司法組）數理·化學·生物·土木·機電·航空·銀行·會計等系·加上去年奉命創辦的海洋生物系及今秋新設的國際貿易系，合計爲四院十七系。此外，理工分院，機電分系以及體育系的增設，據說在最近期內，也有逐一實現的可能了。</p>
<p>設備方面，在抗戰期間所受的影響最小，所以圖書儀器保存得以新近文法學院圖書的大量購買，以及工學館大厦的落成，都處處表現出厦大在勇邁的躍進中。</p>
<p>師資方面，新近更延聘到王亞南，郭大力，郭一岑……他們都是國內外素享盛名的學者。各種研究室的設立，也顯示着厦大勤勉的學風正在日益發揚光大。</p>
<p>美國駐滬副領事柯克先生，前曾一度赴該校參觀，並希望美國的大學得與厦大互派留學生，接着我們就看見報載菲律賓政府將派留學生四名前來。這些，正說明東大不僅是全國性的最高</p>
<p>厦大本年度的招生工作，已次第展開，考區決定分厦門·福州·上海·南昌·汕頭五區，錄取名額暫定為五百七十名。</p>
<p>民主的風氣開得較早，近年來廈大更顯得特別進步。汪校長身體力行，以建設一所最合理想和最民主的廈門大學自期，我們也同樣地希望他的願望達到成功，為新中國的敎育建設創造一個良好的楷模！</p>

<p>成都十日航訊</p>
<p>今年是四川的不幸年，在天府之國，素稱安定的成都，人爲米潮甫告平息，米荒問題猶未解除的時候，本月又遭空前大水災。受害人民數逾十萬，公私財產拱失六百億元。由於月來的天災人禍，患害頻來，使幽閑安定的成都社會，變成了一幅哀鴻遍野的悲慘流民圖。</p>
<p>成都平原是全國量富庶區域，因爲岷江上遊有世界著名的都江堰水利工程，構成「民無饑饉，不知水旱」的天府之國。靜靜的錦江，環繞蜿蜓在錦城四週，迴旋如帶，平時祗供遊賞，百年以來，從無成災之怖，養成成都人民毫無防洪的印象與經騐。月來，川西霪雨不止，山洪暴漲，岷，沱，涪諸江上遊隨之潰泛，都江堰的飛沙堰人字堤均告冲毀，內江水位激漲。四日零時起，成都滂沱驟降，豪雨如注，天地晦暗，連綿一晝夜，平地水深三尺，錦江汎濫，怒濤倒灌市區，低窪處水齊屋管，全市洪水滔滔，一片澤國。沿江房屋人畜物料爲巨波冲散，隨波逐流，慘聲動天。建築百年的安順橋和六十餘年萬福橋，俱爲洪水淹沒冲毁，其餘大小橋梁冲毁六十餘座。不及走避的沿江居民，千餘人隨洪水作波臣，一切財產盡爲巨浪席捲一空，造成六十餘年空前第一次大水災。</p>
<p>十萬災民一片瓦礫</p>
<p>豪雨迄五日始告戢止，但市區仍成一片澤國。記者涉水登城樓鳥瞰災情，但見四野茫茫，洪浪滔滔，被冲毁的房舍，傢俱，什物，屍骨，牲畜，以及沿江倉庫中儲藏的鹽煤木材貨物，滾滾逐波而下，災民扶老携幼，栖栖皇皇，爭登高處避水，刻劃出洪水的可怖慘景。七日洪水漸退，記者再到災區查戡，昔日繁盛遊樂之區，僅存荒烟亂草，一片瓦礫，繁華的安順萬福兩大橋，數百住戶房舍悉被洪流掃捲一空，沿江居室，幾無倖存。傾家蕩產的災民，呼天搶地，痛哭流涕，慘絕人寰。根據市政府調查，這次受災住戶逾三萬戶，災民數逾十萬，公私財產損失逾六百億元，這是成都近百年從未遭受到的空前浩刦。</p>
<p>都江潰堰雨量失節</p>
<p>成都－這一個平原上的安樂土，並無高山大川，爲什麼突然遭受到空前水災？據水利局調查　成這次巨災異象；第一是川西近日霪雨，山洪暴漲，岷，涪，沱諸江上遊洪水泛濫。都江堰阻水的飛沙堪人字堤均爲洪水冲塌，內江水位已達最高頂點二十三劃－（平時在七八劃上下），川西諸流域水勢浩大，情勢岌岌可危。第二，四日各地豪雨，成都附近雨量逾三百公厘，超過往年同月全月之和，府河無法容納，遂汜濫橫流，適都江上遊洪水驟至，於是匯流成災。而同時不僅成都一地，附蓉十餘縣均成一片汪洋，如金，彭，崇，新，灌，溫，郫，號稱成都內十六屬各縣都成空前巨災。成渝，成灌，川陝，川康諸公路，田地淹沒，公路冲毀，橋樑斷塌，交通中斷，人民財產損失不可勝計。據父老說，內流域所遭如此巨災，實百年來所僅有。</p>
<p>嗷嗷災黎坐待賑濟</p>
<p>成災以後，十萬災民流離失所，情景凄慘，待坐賑濟。省市政府　聯合各機關成立「聯合緊急救濟委員會」，省府生席鄧錫侯，省參會議長向傳義；黨部主委黃季陸相偕前往查勘災情，慰問災民，並電呈國府蔣主席及政院張院長，報告災情，諸中央撥急賑百億救濟。除鄧氏私人捐廉一千八百萬濟災外，並發動全市公私機閘團體，工商行號，巨室富戶踴躍捐賑。但其間表現最熱烈的是平時工作最爲淸苦，連日爲米荒早已懸釜待炊的成都新聞界。此間的新新新聞，於水災後首先捐獻同人一日薪資百萬，以後並代募賑金數千萬元。陸續響應的有中央社，工商導報，中興日報等。九日成都新聞界特組織「擴大聯合募捐賑災大會」，發動全市民合捐一日所得運動，向滬，京，渝同業同鄉請求援助，並舉行遊藝募捐，以新聞同仁的如此熱心，預卜成績一定圓滿。</p>
<p>速日各界捐賑運動熱烈展開，省府已撥賑十億，中央亦決匯款急賑。中國國民黨中央執行委員會及上海川康聯誼會等紛紛來電慰問，這是人類同情心的最高表現，據說「同情是人類文明的表徵」，此間災黎，熱烈希望京滬的川籍同鄉，由同情而進一步予以切實援助。</p>
<h3>天堂起微波　杭市參議會的趣味議題　交際舞與餛飩擔</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>杭州十八日快訊</p>
<p>靜靜的杭州「天堂」，有時也要激起微微地薄波，這一圈圈弧形的水花中，市參議會往往是其中的主流。這水花，大都是富有異常的趣味，使人會縈廻於腦際而最後發出微微的笑聲。</p>
<p>卅六年七月十一日，杭市首屆參議會舉行第五次大會，提出了兩個極有趣味的問題，一是禁舞開放，一是取締餛飩担。這兩個問題麻煩了市參議員的緊張熱烈的論辯，也轟動了整個的杭州市。</p>
<p>事情是這樣的，杭州市的跳舞，自從卅五年六月受了壓力而禁止了以後，許多舞女們尚徘徊逗留在西子湖濱，終期不久以後，可以仍舊開放，因此，許多舞廳都向市府請願，要求繼續</p>
<p>維持跳舞營業</p>
<p>，市府為了繁榮市面，增加稅收，自然在贊成之列，但是報紙還是繼續的指責，參議會還是堅持不准。以致新化鉅資建成考究舞塲的湖濱西湖飯店底中美舞廳，也只有改營歌唱咖啡館等別業。自此以後，咖啡館只要一有機會，就請求開放舞禁。市府也爲了體恤商艱，所以在每逢佳節之時，必開放舞禁三天，如去年國曆新年，就開放了三天，到陰曆年關，又開放了三天，無如這三天以後，咖啡館拖拖延延，以期造成旣成事實，這樣延到半偶月以上，許多報紙又嚴加指責，市參議會再開會，女參議員極力反對跳舞，議長張衡也極力反對跳舞，於是市府禁令又下，咖啡館同業集合所有職工向市參議會請願，下一天東南日報上載舞女要拔掉議長張老頭子的鬍子，又要到市參議會跳裸體舞。再下一天，東南日報又載議長張衡大發議論，謂縱使舞女拔鬍子，我也「威武不屈」。參議員齊集參議會，深恐舞女眞的到參議會跳裸體舞。於是各咖啡館門前</p>
<p>大貼標語廣告</p>
<p>，痛駡市參議會不該這樣糊裏糊塗禁舞。中美咖啡館並且奉送客人喝茶，呼籲必須開放舞禁。在這一段過程中，咖啡館同人會經紹待過好多回新聞記者，有一次甚至說：「市政府答應開放了，市參議會也沒有話了，只要記者們不說話就行了。」在全市的記者中，也有兩種不伺的主張，一則主可開舞禁，一則主不開舞禁，當時在紹待會上幾乎成了僵局。</p>
<p>今年春天，蔣經國氏發起籌募淸寒學生助學貸金，籌募委會決定以開放舞禁爲籌募方法之一，於是去公事市政府，市參議會知道了，女參議員褚籌康嚴厲反對，議長當然不甘後人，也極力反對。這樣一直到這次開市參議會大會以前，市政府以一件交談案交大會商討，案題爲奉令擬訂杭州市限制各娛樂塲所舉行交際舞暫行辦法草案請核准案。同時在市警局慶祝該局改制週年紀念的聚餐席上，市黨部代理書記長錢鏡西登台演講，鼓吹開放跳舞之利，調：「祇要管理得法，非但可以維護善良風氣，且可繁榮市面，增加稅入，否則，秘密舞廳，仍在地下活動，計亦非得。」市參議會議長張衡談他昔日</p>
<p>「拔鬍子」故事</p>
<p>略謂：「參會前度主張禁舞，致舞女要拔本人的鬍子。月初本市記者聯歡會從餘興，到歌女甚多，阮廳長贈太人詩兩句：「請看座上客，盡長拔髯人；」本人亦答阮二句：「早知今日事，悔不聽君言。」蓋阮　年曾力勸本人勿蓄　也」。並謂渠昔年曾聘西女敎舞，已諳習入成，迄未全忘。下一天各報都以顯著地位刋載立法院立法委員兼浙贛路理事會顧問湛小岑氏一文，題爲「何必禁舞？」他意思；跳舞爲人類藝術史佔朮要地位，歐洲自實行交際舞後，行之千數百年而不衰，因爲這可以促進兩性的和諧和轉移風氣。並且說來杭州的賓客，除了玩風景外，幾都感着枯寂。他主張夏天在平湖秋月，三潭印月，第六公園，蔣莊，民衆運動塲佈置露天舞塲。這文章發表以後，參議會審查會將市府交議的限制交際舞暫行辦法保留了，議長</p>
<p>張衡捋着長髯</p>
<p>說：「我不怕拔鬍子，如果討論到這一議案表決時，正反同票後，我必投反對票一票。」這樣的說法，可以說議長是一種暗示，於是接着報紙上又有文章發表，一則爲韓遲君寫的「我國需要跳舞嗎？」大意爲中國社會目前不能接受。一則爲汪錫鵬君寫的「誰以跳舞爲樂」，他以爲以跳舞爲樂的不是大多數的民衆，而是少數人。　十七日的這一天，是討論市府交議的「限制交際舞辦法案」。激起了很大的論辯，市府主任秘　徐雄飛首先說明；「本案提出後，輿論反應有贊成與反對兩派意見，年來賓客來杭遊覽，每對杭市缺少舞塲，引以爲　，市府爲折衷起見，取消舞女制度，於嚴格管制下開舞，諒無流弊，至於總動員法雖實施，但觀美國戰爭時期，士兵抗敵不廢跳舞，以彼例此，亦無不可，」參議員分爲兩派，一派爲反對者謂：「請問政府，開舞之目的何在？如爲財政者似可連帶開放賭，娼，苟爲點綴天堂者，則目前應建設之事如屬環境衛生等方而正多。又開舞之對象爲豪門富戶，則其景氣殊有塲內燈紅酒綠，塲外乞丐橫陳之慨，而開舞的結果，可能引起打風，風化，貪汚諸項問題。一派爲贊成者謂：「如認跳舞有碍風化，則三輪車上，行人道上，電影院中亦須取締男女並行並坐，都市之不准開舞，乃西人引爲驚詫之事。」</p>
<p>兩派相持不下</p>
<p>下午重行開會討論，在整個與會的很多議員，都認爲這是空前的緊張熱烈。當下午正討論此案前，市長周象賢起立說明謂：「交際舞係一種高尚的藝術社交行爲，今空軍官校亦在進行，貴會旣然這樣討論，就此撇回此項議案。」撤回後，參議會無一人重提研討，就此不再討論，市長亦匆匆離席。至於跳舞在杭州開禁與否？今天還是成爲懸案。我以爲一種問處，尤其是娛樂問題，不好看得太嚴重，看得太嚴重了，往往就不好辦，中國的社交行爲向來與歐西不同，一時要開放到歐西的程度，自有許多窒得，但是時代是在進步的，不容我們再徘徊觀望，甚至不事進步啊！　另一件趣味的事是</p>
<p>要取締餛飩擔</p>
<p>有一位參議員在質詢市當局長時謂：「餛飩祖深宵擊拆，擾人淸　，應請制止。」警局長表示照辦，於是在深宵街頭，很多鯤純担都捉向官裏去，餛純担集體向市參議會請願，同時有一個餛飩担的老闆李大田寫一信致提議制止餛飩祖擊柝的參議員周師洛謂：「親密的參議員周師洛先生：當我們聽到周先生禁止我們</p>
<p>夜間不準擊析</p>
<p>的時候，我們感到十二分的驚慌，因爲夜間不能擊柝，何異禁止了我們的賣買，斷絕了我們的生路。你想一家數口靠誰呢？我們眞奇怪米漲到這樣貴，物價漲到這樣高，先生爲什麼不替我們想想腦筋呢？不壓低壓低呢？却偏要在我們餛飩担上傷腦筋，據周光生說，夜間擊柝，擾人淸夢，但是我們覺得很奇怪，有時我們挑担至ＸＸ路，高大牆門的時候，祗要拍拍的柝擊二下，高大牆門就會打開，跑出一個娘姨來，向我們買餛飩；房間內還傳出闢關拍拍的牌聲，擾人淸夢的嘩啦嘩啦聲，據娘姨告訴我們，這地方就是Ｘ議員的公館。有時我們在ＸＸ路的公館門前覓到一位太太坐着自備包車，叮叮噹噹踏着坐鈴震天價響，擾人淸夢的回來，據　媿告訴我們，這就是Ｘ議員的太太，周先生，你想吧！這個是不是豈有此理，那個擾人淸夢呢？我們爲着生活，他們爲着什麼呢？請局先生救救小百姓，收回成命吧，我們是十二萬分的感恩。」</p>
<p>十七日參議曾亦討論此案，周議員說對本案已考慮一年之久，始於今日提出。另一參議員謂擊柝不響，生意便不來，他認爲深夜擊柝頗見詩意，大可任其擊之。結果火會認本案提出後夜間餛飩担已形减少，故決議保留。</p>
<p>這兩樁極燒趣味的案子雖然是道樣輕輕地，容易地過去了，但是問題還是存在着，還是沒有解決。（本報攝）</p>

<h3>聯合國兩年工作新檢討</h3>
<p>七月八日滬聯譯</p>
<p>大會和經濟曁社會理事會對此問題，曾經多次集會討論，以遣送難民回國及重新安插爲討論要點。難民的原籌國，要求遣送難民回去，其他會員國則堅決主張任何難民凡有充分理由且知悉一切事實者，便不應違背其願望，將其送回本國。</p>
<p>一九四六年十二月十五日，大會通過國際難民組織組織法，這團體的任務，爲儘量遣送難民歸國，至於無法遣送的，則設法並監督其重行安頓在其他地方。　國際難民組織至今尚未成立，已經簽署組織法者，共十八國，其中祗有五國是無條件簽字的，這五國的捐款，祇佔第一年經費預算百分之一九·四七，組織法實施之前，至少須經十五國批准，而經費至少須捐足百分之七五。但籌備委員會今已在工作中從七月一日起，代國際難民組織，負起照料難民的責任。</p>
<p>貿易方面，聯合國已直接負責，在日內瓦進行談判，以求一般的减低關稅壁壘，參加談判者共十九個國家。　經濟曁社會理事會，爲促進貨物之擴張，生產，交換及消費起見，同意在倫敦召開國際性的會譏，在這會議召開之前，先成立籌備委員會，負責擬具國際貿易組織的組織草案，籌委會已在倫敦紐約先後開會，現在日內瓦繼續開會商討，同時，多數國家的關稅談判，也在進行中，規模之大，前所未有。國際貿易與就業會議在聯合國主持下，將在本年底舉行，地點尚未確定。國際貿易組織的組織法，草案，將在該會議提出討論，以求核准。</p>
<p>過去數月來，聯合國決定成立機構，以使供給需詢專家給會員國。經濟曁社會理事會已訓令秘書處與各專門機關合作，協助會員國羅致所需要的專家並給予研究及其他便利，經社理事會所屬幾個委員會，亦經授權，如遇會員國請求，便應供給技術或其他協助。</p>
<p>一九四六年六月十九日，經濟曁社會理事會在紐約召開世界衛生會議，出席者除五十一個會負國的代表外，又有其他十三國派員列席旁聽，會議中通過新的國際機關，即世界衛生組織的組織法，這專門機關，將指導與調整國際衛生工作並進行爲保障與改善世界衛生所必要的許多任務，等聯合國十六個會員國批准簽字，世界衛生組織即可成立，迄今爲止，已有十四國批准，其中十個是聯合國會員國，國際衛生組織正式成立以前，臨時委員會已在進行工作。</p>
<p>國際聯盟存在期間，始終有一個廣及全世界，管制麻醉劑生產和分配的有效制度，這種責任，現在已由聯合國負起，四十九個會員國已經簽署一九四六年十二月十一日的議定書，修改現行有關麻醉劑問題的協定，經濟曁社會理事會在最近一次會議中，也曾與管制德日兩國麻醉劑的辦法，建議於谷國政府，又對麻醉劑的效用，開始作新的研究，此外對於吸食雅片並不違禁的國家，請其禁絕此稱惡習，並取締雅片的製造和販賣。</p>
<p>關於國際人權法案（這是經社理事會人權委員會最重要職務之一），業已開始工作，這法案的初次草案，現正由起草委員會草擬中，即將報告經社理事會及人權委員會。最後的草案，則準備於一九四八年提交大會討論。</p>
<p>人權之一，即婦女的平等權利，交婦女地位委員會研究，這委員會已開過第一次會議。大會在紐約集議時，對於婦女參政權問題曾加特別討論，並一致通過決議案，籲精尚未容許婦女參政各國，應給予婦女與男子相等的參政權。（全文完）</p>
<h3>新輸入管制辦法實施後　港華貿易窒息　廣九路大規模遊擊式走私猖獗</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者程志政</p>
<p>香港十六日航訊</p>
<p>自從輸入管制辦法實行以後，受影響最大的，莫過於香港。大家都知道，香港是中外貿易的橋樑，國外貨物運到香港以後，必須轉運上海，或是經過廣州再輸送到中國內地去，香港本身的消胃是極其微弱的。在輸入管制辦法開始實行的時候，尺度較寬，廣州方面，還容易領到轍入許可證。可是七月一日起忽然來了一個新「結匯辦法」，接備便是不得超過分配規定的第二季輸入限額，照這個新規定，每家入口商每季祇能運入美金九十三元的貨物，這樣渺小的數字，無異是對人口商行開玩笑。廣州的輸入管理分會，規定合格的入口商，要有二十億以上的資本。但照限額分配的數字，每季進口九十三美元的物資，恐怕連一個小販的資本也够了，政府法令的矛盾衝突，往往造成了不少的笑話。</p>
<p>香港的貨物無法內運，貨價在港自然是一瀉千里，凡是向英美定貨的正當商人，無不呌苦連天，因爲定貨遝到，市價也許已跌到成本的半數，所以香港的商業受了國內管制的束縛，已完全窒息，六底結帳能獲盈餘的進出口商，可說是鳳毛麟角了。</p>
<p>這幾天，香港商界已發出了一片不滿的呼聲，認爲新辦法是「自殺政策。」華商總會主席董仲偉說：「政府不合理的管制，必須改善，國內急需之工業原料及洋紙等，已因管制過嚴而價格飛漲，結束國內民衆負擔加車，工廠倒閉，失業增加，殊屬不堪想像。」據聞自七月一日到十四日，廣州方面，竟沒有一個人照規定手續去辦理領證，這充分說明，新辦法是何等令人失望，何等令人啼笑皆非。　因爲政府管制織入的不合理，應遝而生的「走私」，在華南便特別活躍，華南走私，幾乎是公開的秘密，而且是一種大規模的組織，正當商人迫不得已慢慢地也加入了他們的集團，說來是何等痛心的一回事。</p>
<p>香港大規模的走私組織，不下二十多個單位，他們包遝貨物到廣州，普通貨物按貨價抽百分之二十手續費，特種貨物如化裝品電訊器材等等，手續費高至百分之五十。當你在香港付貨以後，他們拿相等銀行存款作爲保證金，如果中途被抄沒收，他們負責賠償，信用十分可靠。他們有特殊勢力作護符·所以海關也無可奈何·報紙上常載着海關緝私艦和走私艇的「海上遭遇戰」，結果戰勝的往往是走私份子。例如粵海關的淸遠砲體，在四月廿八深夜遇着走私艇，激戰數小時，終被兎脫，海關緝私人員，死傷竟達十六人，也可見走私的猖獗程度了。　除了香港出發的私貨，澳門也是一條走私的捷徑，澳門毗連中山縣，神出鬼沒的走私方法也更多。　財政部雖然再派員來港，研究如何防止走私，却是毫無結果，主要的原因是輸入法令過嚴，驅使着商人都走上這條路，次要的原因是走私者幕後有人，投鼠不免忌器。</p>
<p>大規模走私之外，還有遊擊式的走私，他們利用廣九鐵路爲工具，經常帶運小量的私貨，從廣州帶米來港，從香港帶西藥香烟等回廣州，現在廣九道上，跑單帮的走私客，至少有三千多人。</p>
<p>走私的方法，可分爲繞，騙，買，闖四種：大規模的走私組織，自然以買關，闖關爲主，無組織的走私客，祇好繞關，騙關。四月份粵海關的收入是一百七十億元，佔計七月份祗可收四十五億元，如果政府再不釜底抽薪，放寬管制的尺度，不但海關收入要愈來愈少，而且華南走私，也要弄到不可收拾的田地了。</p>

<h3>藝人風度</h3>
<p>— 孫福熙</p>
<p>由味芳園說到中國畫苑</p>
<p>在昆明的時候，季康先生寄寓「味芳園」中，花木繁茂，鳥鳴上下，我曾在此園中畫滇茶，幷有文記園中觀董的感想。</p>
<p>味芳園主梁夫人鄭蘇　女士，擅書畫而又好客，在抗戰的艱苦生活中，我們常有簡樸的茶會酒聚，以文藝研磨的精神快樂，來與物質的苦痛相抗衡。這個小聚是輸流作東，周子敬先生在西郊的中央研究院，黃玉珂光生在上海銀行的宿舍崇廬，劉雪然與我在商務酒店我自名之「天地爲讀」。每次聚會均有繪畫合作音樂演葵等節目，有一次是安南畫家作最展覽，安南音樂表演。當時我常說：「現在的暢快還是不足爲奇，五年十年以後，回憶中方知今日的意味濃厚。」不到五年，在今日的回憶中，已是意味深長數倍於前了。</p>
<p>雲南省文化運動委員會發起雲南全省第一屆美術展覽會，我是文化運動會美術組組長，任當然主幹，全國藝術勞軍展覽會，我是發起人，也是主任委員，每次舉行美展，事務繁忙，助理者不多，季先生與梁太太均參加出品，幷帮助一切事務，謀公益，不計私人利書，故捐獻成績甚佳。</p>
<p>當時盟軍漸多，簇聚昆明，由飛虎隊而十四航空隊而形形式式的步隊砲隊降落傘隊交通輜重隊，新闢了許多飛機塲，新建了許多招待所，總之，社會一切是大變了。許多人知道有利可圖，時機不可失，在全面抗戰的名義之下，有的開酒吧跳舞堪，有的販賣香烟罐頭與美鈔，甚而至於小孩們把中國各種銅圓與銀角，擦得亮亮的，滿街向美国士兵兜售，作爲遊中國的紀念品，黑心的敲他們一竹槓。</p>
<p>吳雨僧（宓）敎授與英美人士常多來往，鑒於盟軍對中國太少了解，而中國所供給於盟友者太枯燥太卑陋了，所以約定美軍招待所的主持人，來信聘請中國畫家至招待所會客廳舉行展覽會，幷作畫學之講演，梁太太季先生與我三人同去，合作繪畫表現，均由吳敎授甩流利的英語加以解釋，使大家心曠神怡。這於中國又化的宣傳裨益甚巨，而季先生的作品就低　的出讓，大量的輸送美國，不但爲中國藝術播揚美名，而且爭取了相當數量的美鈔外匯。</p>
<p>在當時，季先生的作品，成爲唯一高尚的盟軍慰勞品了。</p>
<p>我們一望而知，季先生的繪畫深得北宋宮庭的精髓，不論花卉，草蟲，翎毛，龍虎，山水，尤其是仕女，均富麗典雅，其工力的深湛，非一般人所能比其什一。然而，他決不鈔襲草擬，其生動活潑之氣，全由自己耳目接近大自然得來，故能繪聲繪影，靈氣充溢也。</p>
<p>輸送到美國去的繪畫中，當然以花鳥爲最多，仕女亦不在少　。當時有「西廂記」四幅，用筆精工，而神態輕妙，因係非賣品，經過多少人的熱誠求讓，終於不得不劃愛，而且不得不從新結構，重量了不知多少份了。現在，他已經作成全套十六幅，確是精品。又有「百駿圖」十二幅，以形態色澤不同之駿馬百匹，分列在全年十二個月份的美麗景色中，每幅均有人物，可知其均爲伯樂之流。惟西廂全圖與百　圖當離滇時爲馮佩芬先生所收藏矣。</p>
<p>味芳園中產生了許多佳作繪畫以外，還有一種膾炙人口的出品是古裝美女，季先生研究各朝代服裝，梁太太助其製成模型，作繪畫參考，朋友均紛紛要求，於是就訓練女孩們，大量製造。頭面與雙手均用白繳模籌，塗以色彩，畫成眉目口鼻，如生人無二。最妙的是同一模型，因所繪五官而異其年歲品性與表情之顰痴憂怨，各有神態。這種美女，輸贈美國者亦頗不少。</p>
<p>季先生閉門書讀作畫，十足藝人風度，或有　羨慕其才，或有人沒笑其魚，在藝人看來，有才不足矜，其愚不足恥，徜徉別有天地中，以滿足自己的理想爲已足，此外一切非所問也。</p>
<p>季先生不僅擅工筆，且意筆亦超逸高古，爲不可及。季先生年在少壯，其前途進步，未可限量，但工筆費力過甚，究非四十歲以後之人所能大量生產。今在中國畫苑舉行展覽，欣賞家似宜及早一觀。</p>

<h3>門外談木刻</h3>
<p>— 一几</p>
<p>ＸＸＸ報「新木刻」第七期上，載有安懷先生「談新木刻與舊木刻」一文，對徐蔚南先生六月廿二日在本刋上發表的「本刻界的矛盾」，頗多商討。木刻我完全是外行；不過無論是新的也好，舊的也好，我都愛好。就我這點可憐的愛好經騐而說：我不能同意安懷先生的說法。</p>
<p>安先生說到舊木刻可取之處，僅僅祗有這麼「狹隘」的一點；即「舊木刻最基本的性質只不過在科學製版術沒有發達之先，爲了行遠及衆而被重視，與今日銅鋅版性質相同，後來因爲有些精工，刻得比科學製版古雅有趣，才被文人賞玩了」，他是不承認藝木刻的刻工是一種藝術的，所以進一步說：「如果這種複刻的單純技術，値得推崇的話，那麼今天許多照相師和科學製版師也可譽之爲天才藝聖了。……」</p>
<p>安先生似乎祗抓住了一部「北平箋譜」，而忽略了幾百年來的木刻作品，所以竟否認了刻工也是一種藝術。「北平箋譜」確實是陳師曾，齊白石等文人用以替代銅鋅版的玩意兒；但，不能就此肯定複刻技術便等于銅鋅版，明末陳老運的「水滸頁子「人物飛動如生，眼睛若有光芒射出；雍正時影刻的，也因刻工高明，與原作無大差異。可是看一看近日出版附有銅圖的「水滸」，那些圖做除了「形」似以外，神態是全非了。這是什麼緣故呢？如果不承認複刻也是一種藝術，魯迅先生輯「北平箋譜」時，西諦先生輯「中國版畫史圖錄」時，何不用五彩橡皮版套印，而必求諸于刻工？尤其是後者，一部分是先製成珂　版石印下來然後再刻，再印的。木刻畫有木刻畫的特徵，一如其他岡畫，都是藝術的一種；而不同于照相。在製版技術發達的今天，安先生獲拿着鋼刀創作，並不去求之子銅版鋅版，以門外後的我看來，恐怕也有原故的。</p>
<p>我不知安先生除了「北平箋譜」以外，還翻過其他的舊木刻過沒有？中國的舊木刻並不全部是複刻，徵派版畫刻工黃氏父子據西諦先生的考證，都是能够自已意匠經營的·傑作之一的「狀元圖考」便是黃應澄所創作。可知中國的刻工並不全是同于「照相師」的。多少古往的天才藝人，死後竟被人視爲「匠」之流，這未免太可悲哀了。</p>
<p>接受西方木刻藝術的安先生，他或許「忘」了西方也有複刻的藝術的。十八，九世紀間英國的「獸圖」「鳥圖」「列那狐」插圖等，都是畫，刻分開的「世人每以版畫多摹刻名作，非獨立之藝衛。然于名畫之擷取精華，豈易事哉！……蓋畫家與木刻家固若鳥之雙翼，車之變輪，相倚爲用者也」·鄭振鐸先生在中國版畫史中說的話，安先生是値得一讀的！</p>
<p>把複刻認爲是銅鋅版，把刻工認爲照相師，除了安先生以外，我不知還有幾個人會同意這個說法！</p>
<p>安懷先生指出現在的木刻目標是：「現實主義和民族形式」；這條道路自然是對的。可是他又說：「如果它不道樣，不是又將走向山水，花鳥，魚虫的牛角裏去嗎」？我一再懷疑：安先生除了「北平箋譜」以外，不知還翻過其他的舊木刻過沒有？由他的話，可推測他心目中的舊木刻純粹是山水，花鳥，魚虫這隻「牛角尖」；可是舊木刻還有更廣大的天地呢！明淸兩代許多戲曲的挿圖，除了歷史故事以外，在當時都是具有深刻的現實性的；其題材也絕不限於山水虫魚。舉個「雅俗咸宜」的例子而說吧；道，咸年間費丹旭的「陰鷺文圖證」，它是勸善、懲惡，敎人信奉神明的；（在那個封建，神權的時代中，人們自然不知道什麼「現實主義和民族形式」，滬自然盈予原諒的。）我不知「陰騭文圖證」的「說敎」，和今日許多爲馬，列主義「說敎」的木刻，在原則上有何分別？可見舊木刻並不純是一隻「牛角尖」，只是新木刻的作者沒有去好好接受吧了。</p>
<p>安先生最後提到「大衆化」，他以爲提倡舊木刻不如提倡連環圖畫；他並引用魯迅的話，暗暗指出舊木刻好像「是文人墨客的小擺設。」這句話單單以北平箋譜爲「箭垜」，自然是應毋庸議的。可是，無數卷佛經，戲曲，小說中的挿圖，尤其是像「百孝圖說」等木刻，到今天還爲一般老百姓所愛閱讀，你能說他不够「大衆化」嗎？你能說它是「文人墨客的小擺設」嗎？</p>
<p>上面的話，我不是一手抹殺二十年來新木刻作者的努力；相反的，木刻作者努力是應當予以贊揚的。不過，作爲一個新木刻作者的安懷先生，當祇知道「半個歐美」，當衹知道一部「北平箋譜」時，就將千百年來中國木刻作者的努力予以全部否定，甚而至於說那些都彷彿是照相師，製版師，這種狹窄的心胸，實不應該是一個藝人所有的。</p>
<p>按：新木刻在中國雖只有二十年的歷史，但旣有文壇先進倡導於前，又曾參加抗戰宣傳於後，即就木刻協會今年四月間在滬舉行復員後第一屆全國木刻展覽出品而言，內容覽富，成績頗有可觀。</p>
<p>當然一般木刻家不會抹煞了木刻在中國已有數千年歷史，深入民間，建立了民族形式。自然也不免有少數人士忽略了傳統的藝術技巧，而認爲只是西洋版靈的摹仿。因比也就發生了新木刻與舊木刻的爭論。其實這問題很普通，即如文學方面，十年前也曾有人因爲覺得口語辭彙的貧乏，主張向古典文學作品去學習，本來這只是指導靑年寫作的一種方法。但在當時却遭遇到許多抨擊；而另外却有人介紹莎士比亞豐富了英語系國家的語言，以及普式庚豐富了俄語的辭彙的論證，便一致公認爲是至理名言。所以這個問題也正如爭辯月亮是外國的亮，還是中國的亮一樣的不必再等待結論。</p>
<p>我總常這樣想，中國現代的文藝固地够荒蕪貧瘠的了，我們需要學習，認眞的學習，不徇中外古今，名著名作，都是學習的對象，不過應該吸其精英，而汰其糟粕，這也是老生常談。</p>
<p>徐先生和一幾先生的文章也都不失爲善意的建鐵，重新給木刻界提示一種採取參考資料的方向，在這觀點上，我想安懷先生也會同意的。至於本刋因篇幅有限，關於這問題的討論，也想就到此爲止了。</p>

<h3>耄耋富貴圖</h3>
<p>— 凌虛</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　356</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>我也確實有些困倦；他們這幾點理由，確也有幾分見識於是略略磋商了一下，交換了一些意見就讓「〇四」用軍伴送鼎元回去，並進行探詢耀羣的踪跡。</p>
<p>在行軍作數時期中，尤其正當軍務倥偬，工作緊急的當口，凡負有指揮戰責的大小將領，最難解決的問題之一，就是睡眠。在攻守期間，充分睡眠的話，簡直談不到；能够安安逸逸，一覺睡眠三四小時，就認爲無上幸福。然而睡眠又是一個維持生命不可或缺的條件；因爲不睡眠腦筋就得不到休息，沒有休息，工作時間過長，任是龍馬精神，也元自頭暈腦脹；不說緊急指置，當機立新車要問題，就是批，覆，一類機械工作，頭臘一不淸楚，就得出錯。</p>
<p>高級指揮，當然有機要秘書，幕府，參謀，主任副官，等等，可以在某種限度範圍內，代勞代辦，可以略略抽空休息。像我這樣等級，尤其是我這特殊工作，這等又瑣碎，又複雜，又機密，並且每件問題，都有相當重要的分量，差不多事事都得躬親辦理；簡直非躬親不可，那麼，呌我們如何得到一頓充分的睡眠呢？况且就像百忍莊的淘氣小姐子珊的話，　見和我們部下這一條路綫上的工作，是「冒着三重危險」的性命兒戲勾當，與普通特務，又自不同，說句實話，我們連做夢都得躭足心事，恐怕一時神經鬆弛，在夢　當口，把這「三重」性的機密洩露了；所以睡眼一事，對於我們，竟是一個老大的嚴重問題。</p>
<p>可是我們這近身邊的幾個人，對於睡眠一項，各人都有自己的「秘訣：」像大　子「〇四」，可以勿庸替他煩心。他的體質，比水牯牛還健實，因此有一個天生的美德，能够三十多個小時，目不交睫。但是，又有一宗缺陷，有時困倦起來，一頓飯未用舉，筷碗還在手上，竟能立時伏在桌上，呼天大鼾，夢入邯鄲。這一睡熟，任您用錐子扎他，也不見得能把他弄醒。還有一個最大毛病，睡中喜數咬牙鋸齒，那聲音就像嚼石子一般；並且一邊鋸齒，一邊不斷的夢話；妙在他是個大舌頭兼結舌，話裏還參用高麗，日本，我國山東，三種方言，任何人都聽不懂說些什麼。</p>
<p>像Ｗ君，可說天賦的龍馬精神、似乎永遠可以不用睡覺似的。只要有事，無論何時去見他，日夜二十四小時，他那雙細長而又微微凸出的眼睛，老是活潑潑地圓睜着。問他怎地不感覺疲倦；他總微笑着回答您，「沒到睡的特候！」據他部下說，有時無事，他可以一睡三天三宿。這有些像美國發明大家愛迪生的生理型。</p>
<p>至於鶴見，他在軍隊裏，練過日本式的「忍」功，可以站在那裏睜着大眼睛睡，也能走着睡，還可以一壁談話，一壁打呼；無論疲倦到什麼程度，只要碰到重要問題的刺戟，他可以立時精神煥發，僅僅只要一盆凉水，連頭帶臉一冲澆就行。</p>
<h3>繪畫有師承無宗派論</h3>
<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>我國繪畫，　源於象形文字，運會而生，遞變至多。從形下而趨於形上，神韻意境，粗細工寫，描墓自然景物，發揮作者性靈，一本其作者個性天資而分野。繪畫之質實價値在此，繪畫之民族精神亦在此；初無分宗派之別。後人強分繪畫爲南北派，院體院外派，文人畫派，以至於地域上分派等等，在繪畫之本質上言，實爲極不平準之說。</p>
<p>董其昌稱。王右丞爲南宗之祖，李思訓爲北派之祖，此南北之分，以其水墨渲染與靑絲鈎勒之不同。然此水碾渲染與腎綠鈎勒，僅爲方法與形式之不同，對於描寫自然，表演景物，發揮作者性　之目標，毫無二致。董其昌又稱：『北派自李氏父子以後劉李馬夏，……等宗之，南派自摩詰以後荊關董巨……等宗之』就諾家傳世畫躦觀之，復閱歷代畫記識錄所述，劉李馬夏與荊關董巨作品，未必有若何根本軒輊之點。史稱；『董北苑寫江南山水，設色似李思訓，水墨類王維』。王李眞蹟，世所罕見，曩見故宮所藏之王李，不知是否眞蹟？除李氏纖細，王氏粗勁外，正嚴謹肅，亦復相同。其他董源傳世之著名作品爲「洞天山堂」，「龍宿郊迎」等，靑綠水墨兼施，固無所異於劉李也。</p>
<p>至於繪畫技法之傳遞，師承相議，由來舊矣，惟歷代大家，其始雖以師承某家某法，其終必能自具面目，另闢蹊徑，及其登峯造極後，決非某宗某派所得面可囿之。苟斤斤於一先生之得失，而終其身不變者，其畫必無大成；此我之所以謂繪畫有師承而無宗派。</p>
<p>慈谿季康先生，其先世皆精於繪畫，家學已甚深遠，人物山水花鳥草蟲，莫不神妙，近在中國畫苑舉行展覽，筆者承女畫家龐左王之介，得預展先覩之捷，深佩其繪畫修養之精湛，技法師承之高遠，神韻氣息之靜雅。所作名馬美人，出入於韓幹　愷之。「雙馬圖」，「八駿」諸幀，直登晋唐之室。山水花鳥則米高馬夏，以至錢舜舉，惲南田，兼靑綠水墨，沒骨雙鈎之法。人物山水中，余最愛「撫孤松面盤桓」一幀，用松雪本，有出藍之勝，沈尹老題識，可稱錦上添花之作。</p>
<p>槪觀寗復之畫，寓嫵媚娟秀之氣於工整嚴謹中，直不能以某宗某派囿之，推本探源，李龍眠，韓幹，劉松年，夏禹玉，以及黃荃，徐熙，錢舜舉，憛甫田輩，莫非寗復之師，而融會貫通，不囿於某派某宗而另闢蹊徑者，寗復已不在遙遠</p>
<p>滬濱絮語</p>
<h3>日貨來了</h3>
<p>— 海風</p>
<p>這兩天，本市物價普遍下跌，除其他原因外，日貨將於下月來華，也是主要原因素之一。</p>
<p>這次中日貿易開放，純粹是私人貿易性質，在今年全年輸華物資，據監委　煤等透露，共九千九百十八萬美元，我國運日物資計四千七百六十八萬美元，兩數相抵，我入超五千萬美元</p>
<p>日本運摹物責，大部份爲輕工業物品，如：腳踏車，手表，攝影機，棉　品等，將大量來華傾鵝。</p>
<p>十年前我們常見的那些輕巧，脆薄的日本貨，一二個月以後，又將出現在全國的鬧市中了</p>
<p>我政府對於開放對日私人貿易，採取了極愼重的措置，就已公佈的辦法，約有如下數項：（一）對申請赴日廠商人選，仍有相當限制；（二）赴日商務代表名額，暫定六十四人。</p>
<p>美國所以極力主張開放對日貿易，以及對此次日貨出口，採取出口津貼政策，主要原因，在於將使美國在日佔領費用日益減少；美國最近對日貿易目標，擬將日本出口所得，能償付進口款項，如能達到此項目標，則美國金鈔，不致繼續擴流出。</p>
<p>據統計，自去年一月以來，美國在日本消費，已達三十億美元。</p>
<p>而最近麥帥一切舉措，目標也即在此。</p>
<p>但在中國，單就開放貿易一點，是非常不利的，現在就各方對此反應，作一簡單介紹：</p>
<p>（一）監委萬　等於十六日提出臨時緊急建議，請政府停止考慮開放對日貿易，理由是中日私人貿易開放，入超達五千萬美元，而我輸日物資，是中國極缺乏的　，煤等等，故對日未簽訂和約以前，盈停派商務代表團赴日。</p>
<p>（二）中國經濟專家對於八月十五日恢復中日貿易，認為係一種「經濟侵略」；目下中國並無物品可以輸出，而日本因工業未受損失，將以及製成品對中國大量傾銷。尤其是麥帥規定日貨對美貿易以美金計算，無異為一種「單程交通」。</p>
<p>（三）東北方面對日本的「飢餓出口」，認為東北現在無物可輸出，華北也只有監，而監卻可助他日本兵工化學工業。「七七」前，日本所提倡的「中日經濟合作」，現在卻在美軍佔領下逐步實行了。</p>
<p>（四）而私人方面對此看法，認為現在上海工價超過長崎八倍，如何與日本競爭？日本對外貿易開放後，不僅南洋市塲將為日本侵佔，而中國本身，也將成為日貨泛濫區。</p>
<p>根據以上這些理由，對日貿易，我們是需要從長考慮的。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>文明與野蠻之間</h3>
<p>— 溥倫</p>
<p>－記人類身體的對照</p>
<p>野蠻人和文明人的身體，有一種趣味的對照，已從一鎮名呌貝爾那特羅多夫斯基（Bernard　Rndofsky）的奧籍圖案家的展覽會中表現出來了。</p>
<p>許多有名的圖案家，相信他們所繪畫出來的人類的形態，是具有天然之美的，就是說，人類的身體本來是美麗的。但貝爾那特羅多夫斯基，却否認此說了：他說人類對於他們的身體，是常感到非常不滿意的。他這種頑皮的理論，曾引起不少人的注意和興趣。</p>
<p>關於這個問題，貝爾那特羅多夫斯基已經研究不少時間了，地時時玩弄他自己和他的太太，他和事實奮鬥，儘可能找出野蠻人和文明人的人體形態的題材，來證明他的理論的正確；最後就開了展覽會，還著有一部專書。</p>
<p>他所搜集的作品，有的是漫畫，有的是剪影，有的是石膏像，有的是照片。在這些作品當中，最先給我們一種深刻的槪念，就是古老的洞居的婦女，無論是那一部份，是多醜多脆屬的啊。同時，野蠻人和文明人身體的對照，在這裏反映得特別明顯。</p>
<p>譬如摩登婦女所穿的馬甲和束乳罩，和古代婦女束緊腰部和保護乳部是一樣的。一九〇〇年的眼鏡，祗着重好看而不重實用，這和一九四六年的眼鏡的功用差不多：而阿拉伯奧曼省的女人所帶的似面具，竟然亦同眼鏡相似，緬甸婦女迄今還逍留頸上，套上十幾圈，活像長頸鹿子似的黃銅圈子，和英國維多利亞時代的婦女所套的頸珠圈有點相同。中國女子的纏足，和穿高跟鞋的形狀差不多。非洲的小孩，一生下來，他的頭部水遠以布緊包着，其狀有如圓筒，這和今日摩登婦女做頭髮的亦相似。英國維多利亞時代的婦女所穿的後邊挺得很高而又丰形的圍裙，和南非洲一種賀庭托特土人的婦女，她們的臀部特別腫大一模一樣。最近的婦女，在一箋耳朶掛着上下兩塊迎着的耳環，和非洲另一種珊達古路斯土人的婦人，把耳朶戮壞而掛着裝飾品相似。摩登女子的衣服以至議子喜歡那些花花綠綠的顏色，和南海瑪爾奎斯沙斯島的人民，他們除了上身之外，從面部，手臂，下部，一直到脚趾，都刺以花紋一樣。一些原始種族，新娘是半裸體的，和一九四六年的半裸體的時裝亦有點類同。非洲剛果地方的處女，在她赤裸的身體，以一塊布束在臂部。以表示貞操，這又和最新式的婦女服裝，在後邊亦特別伸出一塊圓形的布一樣。</p>
<p>除此，人類的尊容，在原始時候就開始不滿了，因爲那時候，是人類和獸類鬥爭的時期，故有一種不如禽歡類的感覺：人類的皮膚沒有像鳥類的羽毛染有顏色那　美麗，人類不比狗那麼健壯，甚至比土撥鼠易於跌倒·於是他們就把皮膚全部刺以花紋，著以顏色。他們把自己的眼睛染得發光，好像一雙鷹一樣；而婦女亦儘可能尋求她們很不自然的步行了。我們不管他們這種意識對不對，至少是他們對於自己身體一種不滿意的表現。</p>
<p>人體史是人類史的一部份，從古時發展到現在，文明人的身體是越來越求美觀了。</p>

<p>妓商合作</p>
<p>湖南省石門市新市區遠在市郊以西，僅有妓院孤立區內，與市內相距甚遠，因此營業甚形蕭條。近市內雜技業與妓院業，雙方咸感彼此關係密切，亟有合作必要，聯合向市政府呈請：提議將新市區妓院匯集地區，闢作市塲，俾商妓雙方合作，則市區不難繁榮。市府據此，業已准予遷移，並交由警局着手辦選。</p>
<p>戀愛團</p>
<p>南晶「戀愛團」重整旗鼓。茲悉，該團將分派有力幹部，分赴上饒，九江，贛縣等各大城市，積極展開活動，該團團員均係智識靑年男女，其中少女尤多。目的以「色情」爲資本，以「戀愛」爲手段，以獵取物質生活之享受。發起人爲南昌一熊姓女生，自任團長，下設參謀長一人，亦係女性。下分若干組，每組設一組長，組員十人，男女各半。每十小組爲一大組，設一主任。近館該團規定於每星期日，全體團員在南昌省立體育塲行集合禮。</p>
<p>禁烟淚</p>
<p>四川省參議會最近召開大會時，一般參議員對於川省烟毒日趨嚴重，頗多責難，對禁毒工作咸表懷疑。參議員靳曉畊說：「禁烟督導人員到邊區去查烟，往往抬他的滑竿夫，就是烟鬼。他不但不敢拿辦，而且不敢讓他知道自己是幹什麼的，不然就找不到人抬。」</p>
<p>誠實的恐嚇者</p>
<p>江蘇省高等法院院長孫鴻霖，在公館裏連接到兩封恐嚇信，信中要向孫氏索詐二億元，發信者署名潘仁義，並書明詳細住址。蘇州警察局按址拘捕，解地檢處審訊。經法醫檢騐之下，概潘姓患有極度神經耗弱，結果宣判緩刑二年。東方荊</p>
<h3>蜻蜓生性貪喫甲蟲拖力可驚</h3>
<p>— 東放荊</p>
<p>一隻甲蟲能够拖得動比牠本身重四十倍的東西。如果甲蟲有馬那樣大，牠可以拖得動十萬磅重的車子。</p>
<p>金字塔有四百十呎高，世界上最高的摩天樓是一千二百五十呎高，也不過比一個六呎長身體的人，高兩百多倍。但是，菲洲有一種白　，牠們所築的巢穴，比牠們的身軀，高出一千倍。</p>
<p>有一種黑蠅的幼蟲，能跳出一隻四吋深盒子，如果人也有這種跳躍力，那末，祗要一蹬脚，可以跳上八層樓。跳蚤能够跳到比牠自己長二百倍的距離。人類若有跳蚤的本領，可以跳到一千呎以外了。</p>
<p>設想一個好胃口的人，在一個下午坐在那裏吃燒鷄，每五分鐘吃一隻，一直吃一個下午。當然這僅是幻想。不過人類若有蜻蜓那樣地好胃口，五分鐘吃一隻鷄，並不稀奇。一隻蜻蜓，在兩小時中吃掉四十隻蒼蠅。蜻蜓是世界上胃口最好的生物。牠只要有得吃，就是處身針壇上，也安之若素。有一位生物學家，曾經把蜻蜓的尾巴切下來，喂到牠貪食的嘴內。</p>

<h3>影壇一週</h3>
<p>— 李箴</p>
<p>獲得金像獎的「慾海情魔」</p>
<p>近年來好萊塢一直在　着劇本荒，因此許多美國的暢銷書，流行的小說，不管它有否文藝上的價値，差不多都被製片家們陸續的搬上了銀專，塡滿了製片家的需</p>
<p>「慾海情魔」是根據詹姆士凱思的流行小說拍成的，故事是電影上所常見的那一套。但是這部劇本在編寫的技術上，有着它相當可取之處。</p>
<p>故事內容描寫一個母親爲溺愛她的女兒，樣牲了自己的一切，甚至出賣了自己，可是她所追求的，卻正是一個悲劇的結果。劇本中對於美國資本主義的社會生活的描寫，却是眞實而生動。它刻劃了那些成天在做買賣，做生意的美國人，即使是談戀愛，組織家庭，都習慣用生意經的方式來解決，這至少讓我們了解金元社會生活的一面，除了這，那就祗剩下了那個溺愛女兒而仍自作自受的可憐母親了。</p>
<p>獲得金像獎的　克勞　，在這部戲裏，確是有精湛而洗練的演技。但我們必需推荐導演馬格爾　帝茲的　秀技巧，他自然而細緻的處理了全劇，即使是最不易討好的倒叙法，在他的運用下，也是那末熨貼而絲絲入扣。鏡頭的運用，也是值得愛好電影藝術渚去研究的。技術上，攝影，光綫，錄音均佳。</p>
<p>平庸的「殺妻冤」</p>
<p>亞倫賴德是近年來好萊塢的紅星，而這部「殺妻寃」又是以他複員後重返影搜的第一部戲爲號召，可是劇本內容，却是好萊塢的陳腔濫調，誘惑，邇世，債殺，陷害，復仇，串連了這許多情節，湊成了這個故事。</p>
<p>亞倫賴德並無較佳的演技，倒是威廉狄克斯的巴滋，有着豐富的創造，濱流氓哈武德的霍華特雪爾華相當不錯，女主角桃麗絲陶琳的海倫演技太弱了。</p>
<p>胡鬧的「風流二爺」</p>
<p>一個當差的偽裝了紳士，騙得了一位小組愛情，這裏不是打破了階級的戀愛，而是生活空虛中思想上的「架空」故事編得胡鬧而牽强，導演演員，成績均無可取之處。</p>
<p>內容空虛的「怪醫血案」</p>
<p>這又是一部以聚張刺激恐怖愛情作號召的偵探片，故事本身旣平庸而又不足取。</p>
<p>導演對戲的處理，也沒有把握住戲的格調，這只是一部陳腔濫調的三四流片子。</p>
<p>並不出色的「義犬盲探」</p>
<p>好萊塢的編劇者找不出更新的偵探片題材時，他們便想到了這部「義犬盲探」。以這條「義犬」作主角，而那個盲探作了陪襯，但是劇本中的故事，依然缺少了現實的基礎。再說那條「義犬」，在片中也並無特殊驚人的安排。那個盲探，反而被安排得似乎不近情理。</p>
<p>演自探的愛德華亞諾，演技極爲沉着，老練，安哈婷的勞娜稱職而已。</p>
<p>二部歌舞片</p>
<p>歌王奈爾遜埃第的「龍鳳交響曲」與舞王茀雷亞斯坦的「美艷親王」，前者以十五支名曲爲號召，後者却以十五彩色片作炫耀。但是不論故事內容與演出技術，「美艷親王」要校「龍鳳交響曲」爲遜色，即使是十五彩的片子，依然不能挽救劇本與授術上的空盧。至少，「龍鳳交響曲」的歌曲，是値得一聽的。</p>

<h3>Chairman Briefly Visits Bian; Important Meeting Held in Ping; Chief Chen Immediately Flies to Nanjing with Fu Zuoyi</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Chairman Chiang flew to Bian on the morning of the 19th at 9:00 AM with several staff members for an inspection and returned to Nanjing at approximately 6:00 PM in the evening.</p>
<p>[Our Kaifeng Dispatch, 19th] Chairman Chiang arrived in Bian by plane at noon on the 19th, accompanied by Gu Zhutong, Yu Jishi, and others. Few people knew about it beforehand, with only national flags flying throughout the streets. After the Chairman's plane landed, only five people, including Liu Maoen, Wang Zhonglian, and Liu Ruming, were there to greet him at the airfield. After disembarking, the Chairman immediately went by car to the Provincial Government, where the heads of the provincial party, government, and military all paid their respects. The Chairman encouraged them to cooperate sincerely and assist Chairman Liu in stabilizing the local area. He then convened a meeting of military generals in Bian for instructions, which lasted for quite some time. He returned to Nanjing by the same plane at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. After the fact, citizens who learned that the Chairman had visited Bian were extremely excited.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 19th] Chief Chen Cheng’s residence in Ping held an important meeting last night. Li Zongren returned to his residence at 3:00 AM on the 19th. On the morning of the 19th, Chen met with Liu Duo, deputy of the Zhangjiakou Pacification Headquarters; Du Jianshi, mayor of Tianjin; Wen Shouquan, representative of Ge Xishan; and Xu Jiqing.

<p>[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 19th] Chief Chen Cheng stayed in Zhangjiakou for only three and a half hours before flying back to Ping by the same plane. After resting briefly upon arriving in Zhangjiakou, Chen inspected troops at the headquarters square at 12:00 PM and gave a brief speech to all officers and soldiers. He first highly praised the achievements of the troops under the Zhangyuan Pacification Headquarters in recent years and encouraged all officers and soldiers to maintain their past spirit and complete the mission of suppressing the rebellion. After the inspection, he convened a meeting of military and government leaders at the headquarters to inquire about matters, and then flew to Ping by plane at 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 19th] Under Chief Chen's direction, an important military and political conference was held in Beiping on the night of the 19th.

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] After being promoted to Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Sun Liren is responsible for the training of rear echelon troops and will not be going to the Northeast in the short term. Sun told reporters, "I feel a great responsibility upon assuming this position. However, soldiers must obey orders. I will uphold the Central Government's intentions, cooperate with the full mobilization order, and do my utmost to serve the country loyally. As for the current situation, it is becoming increasingly clear. The Communist bandits' blind faith in military force and their betrayal of the nation and its people are unforgivable. Their fate of 'committing many acts of wickedness will lead to their downfall' has long been sealed. As the saying goes, 'Those who win the people prosper; those who lose the people perish.' There is no need for us to elaborate on the Communist bandits' future."</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Military News Agency reports that Tang Enbo, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army Headquarters, went to the front lines in Xuzhou to direct operations after taking office. It is now learned that Mr. Tang returned to Nanjing from Xuzhou a few days ago and officially reported to the headquarters for duty on the 18th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Minister Bai Chongxi invited Li Tiezheng, Ma Hongda, and others for lunch at 12:30 PM on the 19th.</p>
<h3>People's Organizations Across the Country Hold Suppression of Rebellion Rally Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The Preparatory Committee for the Capital's Suppression of Rebellion and National Salvation Rally has scheduled the "Suppression of Rebellion and National Salvation Rally" to be held at the National Assembly Hall at 8:00 AM on the 20th. If there is heavy rain on the 20th, it will be postponed for two days.

There will also be a parade after the meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 19th] The Hankou Chamber of Commerce, the Federation of Trade Unions, and eleven other people's organizations have scheduled a "Rally in Support of the Suppression of Rebellion and National Salvation Movement" to be held on the morning of the 20th in response to the capital's Suppression of Rebellion and National Salvation Movement.</p>

<h3>Huludao: Current Situation of the Only Major Port in the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Huludao, 19th] Huludao is currently the only largest port in the Northeast, with a position more important than Yingkou and second only to Lüda. However, Lüda has not yet been recovered, so currently only Huludao and Yingkou in the Northeast are available for maritime transport. A group from the military support delegation arrived here this morning. The reporter surveyed the area and found that the island slants into the Bohai Sea, with boundless sea and sky, and green waters and mountains complementing each other. The port has six docks that can accommodate ships of 10,000 tons or more. The first dock was damaged by the Communist bandits and is being repaired. According to Zhu Chongguang, deputy director of the Port Authority, the repair project will cost 40 billion yuan and is expected to be completed within the year. Currently, the materials entering and leaving the port are extremely limited. The materials entering are partly equipment from the Resources Committee, and the materials leaving are coal from the committee's Fuxin coal mine, which totaled 20,000 tons in April and has fallen to over 7,000 tons in May. Customs revenue is approximately 60 million per month, almost entirely from state-owned enterprise taxes. The island currently has more than 4,500 residents and more than 50 stores. The comfort delegation held a comfort meeting here today, first presenting a flag to the port commander, He Shili, and inviting people from all walks of life to hold a symposium. Port officials unanimously believe that the port should be utilized urgently. It is said that the port's dock facilities are complete, with a draft of 28 feet, and can simultaneously dock five Liberty ships of 10,000 tons or more and seven ships of 3,000 to 5,000 tons. Most ships currently sailing to the Northeast dock at Qinhuangdao, but because that port is crowded with Kailuan coal, ships often have to anchor offshore, which is not as good as sailing directly to Huludao, which can save a section of railway transport. In addition, the warehouse capacity of Huludao Port is very large and can be utilized, and the Jin-Hulu Road branch line runs directly to the dock, making loading and unloading extremely convenient.</p>
<h3>Henan-Hubei Comfort Delegation Completes Mission and Returns to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The Henan-Hubei Comfort Delegation, led by Liu Wendao, returned to Nanjing on the Jiangtai steamer this afternoon after departing from Hankou. The delegation departed from Nanjing on the 24th of last month and traveled through Xuzhou, Shangqiu, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Xinxiang, Guyong, Hankou, and other places. It held six comfort rallies and many symposiums and small group discussions, which greatly benefited the morale of the people and soldiers at the front.</p>
<h3>Du Yuming Arrives in Ping, Will Fly to Shanghai and Then to the United States in the Next Few Days</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 19th] Du Yuming flew to Ping by special plane at 8:00 AM on the 19th, accompanied by his wife, to transfer to Shanghai. Before leaving, he was supported onto the plane with a bitter smile and saluted goodbye. Many military and political officials and representatives of the people saw him off.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 19th] Du Yuming, accompanied by his wife and son, arrived in Ping from Panjin by China Airlines special plane at noon on the 19th. After disembarking, Mr. Du went to his residence to rest and declined all visitors. It is reported that he will stay in Ping for one or two days before flying to Shanghai and going to the United States with his doctor, Yang Jingting, at the end of the month or the beginning of next month for recuperation.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Du Yuming's departure procedures are currently being processed in Nanjing and should be completed in three or four days. It is also heard that Du once entrusted Chief Chen to forward a letter to Chairman Chiang.</p>
<h3>Government Officials Participating in Legislative Yuan Elections Within Their Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>Should Resign Before the 20th of This Month</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] According to the Election General Office, Article 13 of the Legislative Yuan's Legislative Committee Election and Recall Law stipulates that "incumbent civil or military officials who are candidates in electoral districts within their jurisdiction or where their offices are located must resign five months before the election period." The so-called "before the election period" has been clarified by the Election General Office as before the day of the vote. The voting date for the current Legislative Committee election has been set by the General Election Office as December 21st to 23rd. Counting five months forward from December 21st to July 20th, officials who are restricted by law and wish to run for Legislative Committee must submit their resignation before the 20th of this month. After the 21st, the deadline will have passed, and they will be unable to participate in the current Legislative Committee election.</p>
<h3>Economic Reform Plan Has Many Deletions and Revisions in Content</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The economic reform plan has been reviewed by the National Economic Commission's comprehensive group many times and will soon be finalized and submitted to the general meeting to be held on the 21st. It is heard that the main revisions are to include the "grain" item in the "agriculture" item, the "guide idle funds into the right track" item in the "price" item, and part of the "improve the treatment of public school personnel" item in the "price" item, while the part related to political issues will be deleted. After repeated deletions and revisions, the plan is much simpler than the original.</p>
<h3>Democratic Socialist Party Holds Standing Committee Meeting Today, Will Discuss Participation in General Election</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Democratic Socialist Party is scheduled to hold a Central Standing Committee meeting today, which is the last standing committee meeting before the National Congress. Jiang Yuntian and Wang Shixian have come to Shanghai from Nanjing and will submit a detailed report on the negotiations on participation in the general election and participation in local government. Furthermore, the rumor that the Democratic Socialist Party's National Congress has been postponed is not true. The party's general program will be approved at the meeting.</p>
<h3>Zhang Dongsun Talks About the Current Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] After Zhang Dongsun arrived in Shanghai, a reporter visited him. Mr. Zhang was unwilling to talk much about matters between parties. Regarding the domestic situation, he believes that the opportunities for negotiated peace in the past have been repeatedly lost, which has led to the current situation. The path of negotiation is currently cut off, but it may not be permanently cut off. After World War II, all countries have post-war problems, and there are international factors that are difficult to resolve in the short term. The world has been divided into two, and the United States and the Soviet Union are both busy consolidating their spheres of influence. There is no possibility of coordination between the two countries, but they are unlikely to engage in military conflict in the near future. In this situation, countries caught in the middle are the most painful, and China is one of the victims. As far as the attitude of the United States is concerned, it is in principle to support the National Government, but how to assist is another question. General Wedemeyer's visit to China this time is probably to solve this problem.</p>
<h3>Wuzhi, Northern Henan, Captured</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 19th] Wuzhi, in northern Henan, was captured by Communist bandits at approximately 8:00 AM on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Wedemeyer Passes Through Honolulu; Reportedly Studying Marshall Plan Expansion to China and Korea; Rumor of US Preparing Far East Evacuation Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Honolulu, 10th] Lieutenant General Wedemeyer, en route to Nanjing, stated last night while passing through here: "The six-member committee I lead will study whether it is possible to extend the Marshall Aid to Foreign Countries Plan to the areas controlled by the Communist Party in China and Korea." Mr. Wedemeyer refused to disclose the exact details, only saying that the plan is currently under consideration. Mr. Wedemeyer and his party will continue their journey to Nanjing this morning at 9:00 AM to handle their special mission to assist China.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] General Wedemeyer and his party will land at the Nanjing University Campus airfield at 4:00 PM on the 22nd. Mr. Wedemeyer will stay in Nanjing for a maximum of two weeks. It was originally planned to use the US military advisory group office at No. 5 Haining Road as his residence. In order to avoid General Rooks having to move and to facilitate meetings with the Ambassador at any time, it has been decided to change the location to the US Ambassador's residence at No. 84 Shanghai Road. The Ambassador and his staff have been very busy in recent days, having roughly planned Mr. Wedemeyer's activities in Nanjing and the people he will meet. However, the specific program will be determined after Mr. Wedemeyer himself arrives here.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] According to a dispatch from the Howard News Service correspondent in Japan, the United States has prepared a secret plan to evacuate Americans residing in China and Korea in the event of an incident. In view of the deteriorating situation in China and the stalemate in the US-Soviet Joint Commission in Korea, senior US Army and Navy leaders in the Far East have prepared a plan to quickly evacuate Americans residing in China or Korea, mainly by air transport. It is said that the US Air Force in the Far East can evacuate hundreds of thousands of Americans from any region in the East within 30 days.</p>
<h3>Trial Run of Traffic Between Beiping and Baotou Yesterday</h3>
<p>All Bridge on the Road Have Been Repaired</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 19th] The railway bridges between Beiping and Baotou have been completely repaired, and a trial run was conducted on the 19th.

<h3>Establishment of the Pingjin Autonomy Association Initiated by Famous Figures in Education, Such as Hu Shi, Aims to Promote Local Democracy</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 19th] The Citizens' Autonomy Promotion Association, organized by famous figures in education and industry in Pingjin, was established in Ping today. Hu Shi repeatedly stated: "This organization is not a national political party, nor is it a local political party. It is just a gathering of ordinary citizens with occupations in their spare time. We want to gather together from time to time to talk about local public welfare undertakings and study reform plans. We are all interested in civic autonomy and want to train ourselves to do some work to promote local democracy." The inaugural meeting of the association was held at the Europe and America Students Association this afternoon at 4:00 PM. More than ten members from Tianjin also came to participate, with a total of more than sixty members in attendance. The meeting was chaired by a presidium consisting of Hu Shi, Mei Yiqi, and Zhang Boling. Hu Shi first gave the opening speech, saying: "We believe that the learning and training of democratic politics must start with the society that we care about most. We, the citizens of Pingjin, hope to start our democratic life's learning and training from the autonomous work of the two cities. Urban people should recognize the importance of cities, use the superior conditions of cities, conquer the special difficulties of cities, and work together for cities." He then explained the association's tasks as: (1) investigating municipal administration and citizen life; (2) studying the draft of the Citizen Autonomy Law or City Charter for reference by the whole country; (3) discussing issues related to municipal administration and citizen rights; (4) learning and training democratic life and participating in various public welfare undertakings to promote political and economic improvement. Zhang Boling then gave a speech, saying: "In the past, we were superstitious about using education to save the country, but the constant political turmoil destroyed all of our educational efforts. So, in the last ninety days, I had a great realization, that is, without political stability, nothing can be done well. Now everyone is automatically participating in this meeting, which shows that long-term lessons have made everyone have a common awareness." Zhang also said that the association is not a party organization and hopes to have educational value for the people of the whole country. Li Zhuchen and Hu Xian also gave speeches one after another, and finally discussed the constitution, declaration, and proposals, and conducted elections.</p>
<h3>Chairman Orders Additional Appropriation of Emergency Relief Funds for Siping Street</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Panjin, 18th] The Central Government has decided to increase the emergency relief funds for Siping from 1 billion national currency to 500 million circulating coupons (equivalent to 5.75 billion national currency). Chairman Chiang's telegram has arrived here, and the Executive Headquarters is currently formulating specific relief measures for the Siping plan.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Receives Reporters on the Anniversary of Presenting Credentials</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The 19th is the anniversary of Ambassador Stuart's presentation of his credentials in Guling. Our reporter met this kind old man at his residence. He was full of energy and walked as briskly as ever. When talking about the events of this day last year, he could not help but laugh heartily. He has been very busy these days and has only now been able to rest and spend a quiet weekend. The Ambassador did not talk about actual issues. According to a friend of his, General Wedemeyer's work did not infringe on the Ambassador's powers and responsibilities, and he had no objections to it. The Ambassador's decision on whether to stay or leave depends on whether it is beneficial to the Chinese people. The rumors caused by General Wedemeyer's new mission were probably caused by the Chinese people's lack of understanding of American character and political style.</p>
<h3>Bullitt to Arrive in Shanghai This Week and Visit the Northeast After Transferring to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Life Magazine's Shanghai office reports that former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Bullitt, will leave Japan for Shanghai this week. Mr. Bullitt plans to stay in China for a week. In addition to deciding to visit Nanjing, the rest of his inspection plan, including visits to the Northeast and North China, can only be determined after arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 18th] Howard News Service diplomatic reporter Simms wrote on the 18th that a well-experienced European diplomat behind the "Iron Curtain" believes that the Soviet Union's decision to boycott the Paris Conference indicates that the Soviet Union will implement more clever plans not only in Manchuria but also in Asia. Since the Soviet Union is determined to divide the world, its goal will be to expand its territory as much as possible. The Soviet Union also knows that in the long run, the Far East is more important to the United States than Europe. The importance of the Far East to the Soviet Union is no less than that. The order of Soviet action will be the nine provinces of the Northeast, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, North China, Vietnam, the Dutch East Indies, Korea, and even India.</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits in the Northeast Capture Shuangyang</h3>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch, 19th] Communist bandits captured Shuangyang, and one unit advanced to Xin'anbao, thirty kilometers southeast of Changchun. In addition, the Yantongshan Communist bandits gathered north on the 18th, and the National Army is fighting them separately. The fighting in the Jichang and other areas is bound to be prolonged. The Communist bandits are planning to use "fluid warfare tactics" to buy time in an attempt to "wear down" the National Army.</p>
<h3>Peng Xuepei Goes to Qinghai</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 18th] After Politicial Commisioner Peng Xuepei left Lanzhou, he visited Xinglong Mountain yesterday. On the morning of the 18th, he went to Qinghai for sightseeing by special military plane, accompanied by Ma Jizhou, director of the Gansu Civil Affairs Department. He is scheduled to return to Lanzhou on the 21st and then go to Yumen and Dunhuang for inspections. If time permits, he also plans to visit Xinjiang. According to what he told reporters, there is no mission for this trip. He will take the opportunity to conduct a private study of Northwest economic issues.</p>
<h3>A Batch of Former Kwantung Army Still Roams the Border Between China and Korea; No Response to Our Government's Surrender Offer</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] 50,000 former Japanese Kwantung Army soldiers are still roaming Changbai Mountain at the border between Korea and Northeast China. This is the news brought back by Japanese people who were sent back to Japan from Northeast China. They said that these Japanese troops have not responded to the Chinese government's surrender request. It is said that the remaining units of the Japanese Kwantung Army are very well equipped, have solid defenses, and have good supplies. According to Jushun Tsugiro, a Japanese returnee, 40,000 former Japanese Kwantung Army soldiers and 18,000 Japanese refugees in Dunhua on the Sino-Korean border went to Changbai Mountain when Japan surrendered. They were all fully armed, carrying 5,000 horses and enough food and ammunition for two years. They built fortifications in the deep mountains, dug caves, and the entire force was divided into groups, each with 2,000 people, with five miles between groups, using radio to maintain communication. When the Chinese government troops entered Dunhua on November 2, 1946, they used radio to notify the Japanese troops in the mountains to come out and surrender, but the Japanese troops did not respond to the Chinese government's notification. Later, the Chinese government troops withdrew from Dunhua due to pressure from the Communist army, so contact between the outside world and the mysterious army was interrupted. It was also said that the mysterious army seemed to have a food shortage in April this year, but he refused to disclose the army's activities or whether it would join the Communist army.</p>
<h3>National Army Units Converge Separately: Jining and Sheng Counties Relieved; Southwestern Shandong Still in Combat</h3>
<p>[Our Jining Dispatch, 19th] The focus of the Shandong battles remains in southwestern Shandong. Fierce fighting continues in Yanzhou, Zou County, Yangshanji, and Jinxiang. The siege of Jining has been lifted. National forces advancing south from Tai'an have crossed the Wen River and reached Wucun, poised to reunite with National forces moving north from Tengzhou.</p>
<p>[Our Tengzhou Dispatch, 19th] The Battle of Yanzhou is unfolding fiercely. With the arrival of substantial reinforcements and the completion of new deployments, the National Army is absolutely confident of victory. Military sources here firmly believe that good news will arrive within a week. The frontline report from the 19th indicates that large contingents of troops, stretching from Feicheng and Tai'an in the north to Xintai and Mengyin in the south, have crossed Anjiazhuang, Wucun, Sishui, and the area east of Teng and Zou counties. They have joined forces with National troops stationed in Jining, Yanzhou, Qufu, Zou, and Teng, forming a large encirclement. Chen Yi's main force of seven columns is now completely contained. The decisive battle that could determine the overall outcome of the Shandong campaign is underway. As for Liu Bocheng's five columns, apart from the Yangshanji battle where two divisions have already been annihilated by our forces, the remnants of the remaining two columns are still being pursued by National forces. The one column that attacked Jinxiang has been blocked west of the city at Majiamiao and the area ten li north of the city by National forces. Additionally, the two columns that joined Chen Yi's forces in attacking Jining have been subjected to relentless attacks by National forces from both inside and outside the city, and are on the verge of collapse, retreating northeast of the city. The siege of Jining has been lifted.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 19th] The Shandong Communist bandits have suffered a complete and comprehensive collapse. National forces from various directions, including those between Tai'an and Yanzhou, Zou County and Teng County, and Teng County and Lincheng, successfully converged on the afternoon of the 19th. Traffic between Xuzhou and Jinan has been restored once again. The National Army has not only completely shattered the Communist bandits' ambition to sweep through Shandong with a force of thirteen columns, besiege Yanzhou, and cut off traffic between Xuzhou and Jinan and the Longhai Railway, but has also rapidly deployed five lines of blockade in the Jiajia Mountain area east of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to the west bank of the Xin River, weaving a tight encirclement. The Communist bandits' East China Field Army, consisting of the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th columns, have become turtles in a jar, ripe for complete annihilation. On the afternoon of the 19th, Dushanji was recovered. The National forces are currently coordinating with those in Juye (not yet fallen) and Heze to eliminate the remaining Communist bandits in that area. The offensive by the Communist bandits attacking Jining was thwarted on the 19th. Furthermore, on the 18th, National forces discovered a grenade factory southeast of Sishui in Pipa Mountain, seizing over two hundred crates of grenades and six thousand catties of explosives.</p>
<p>Liu and Chen Bandit Remnants Merge: National Army Prepares to Encircle and Annihilate Them</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 19th] In the past week, the focus of the Shandong battles has shifted entirely to southern and western Shandong. On the southern Shandong front, of Chen Yi's ten columns, the 3rd, 6th, and 8th columns remain scattered in Juxian, Dadian, Yishui, Zibo, Qingshipu, and the area west of Hangjia Town and Yangliu Dian in Laiwu and Xintai. The remaining seven columns have fled south en masse. Among these seven columns, two crossed the Wen River from Tai'an and Feicheng on the 13th and besieged Ningyang. On the 14th, National forces in Ningyang concentrated their forces and broke through to Yanzhou. On the same day, three columns that fled north from Yi and Zaozhuang attacked Teng County with two columns, and Zou County with one column, starting on the 14th. A small portion of the bandits managed to break into Teng County, but they were completely annihilated by the defending forces after a strong counterattack. The two columns that fled west from central Shandong to attack Yanzhou have had their rear supply lines cut off after National forces from central Shandong retook Sishui, Wucun, and other locations. As of the 19th, these bandit forces were still fighting desperately. On the western Shandong front, Liu Bocheng's forces have been attacking Yangshanji, Dushanji, and Liuyingji since the 13th. Except for the latter two, where National forces have broken out, Yangshanji is still being firmly defended by National forces. In the past week, through combined land and air operations by National forces and attacks from both inside and outside, the bandit forces have suffered unprecedented casualties. On the 17th, Liu's two columns changed course and advanced towards Jining. At the same time, two columns of Chen Yi's forces, totaling about 100,000 men, besieged the city walls. The intensity of their firepower surpassed even that of the attack on Yangshanji. However, as of the evening of the 19th, the city walls remained intact. Failing in their objectives, the Communist bandits began fleeing west of Yanzhou on the 17th. In summary, although Liu Bocheng's forces from the west and Chen Yi's forces from the east have merged, they are deeply trapped in the National Army's multiple encirclements and are far from their bases, facing severe supply difficulties. The great annihilation battle outside Yanzhou will soon become the common burial ground for both Chen and Liu.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Xuzhou Dispatch, 19th] National forces advancing into the Yishan mountain area captured Tonglingguan, the most stubborn stronghold behind enemy lines, on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Truth About the Beitashan Incident: Participating Aircraft Did Have Red Star Markings; Local Chieftain's Son Witnessed the Event</h3>
<p>[United Press, Dihua, 17th] Chilerqi Ma, the 26-year-old son of Batu, chieftain of the Kazak tribe in Beitashan, and a cavalryman, told a United Press reporter today: On the 5th of this month, he witnessed three Outer Mongolian aircraft dropping thirteen bombs on Beitashan over a period of two and a half hours, killing one Kazak soldier and over ten horses. One Outer Mongolian aircraft was shot down by Kazak soldiers using machine guns. It was a twin-engine aircraft with red star markings. At the time, the enemy aircraft were covering 200 infantrymen in combat with 100 Kazak soldiers. Outer Mongolian military commander Colonel Sagmi was wounded by a grenade and subsequently captured and executed. He was wearing a Soviet medal, awarded for his success in resisting Japan. Among the enemy spoils captured by the Kazak soldiers were fifteen Soviet and German-style light machine guns, 30,000 rounds of ammunition, seventy grenades, and four gold medals with a relief of Stalin's profile. There was also a Mongolian-language combat order issued by Choibalsan, Premier of the Mongolian People's Republic, instructing Sagmi's unit to occupy Beitashan. Other spoils included photos of Stalin and Choibalsan. Chilerqi Ma and his party came to Dihua on the 6th of this month, the day after the conflict, to report to the authorities. This report has been confirmed by the Chinese military authorities in Dihua, who stated that the July 5th incident was just one of many similar minor conflicts. Zhang Zhizhong, Director of the Northwest Headquarters, told a United Press reporter that the situation in Beitashan is currently calm.</p>
<h3>Xinjiang Traitors Disrupting Peace</h3>
<p>[United Press, Dihua, 19th] Xinjiang is vast and sparsely populated, with an area of over 600,000 square miles and a population of only 1.2 million. One-third of its territory is currently under the control of Ahmatjan, leader of the rebel party. This one-third is the richest area in the province in terms of food and mineral resources, centered on Ili, Tacheng, and Altai. The first two districts border the Soviet Union, while the Altai district is adjacent to Outer Mongolia. The origin of the rebellion dates back to November 7, 1944, in the Ili district capital. After more than a year of war, a peace agreement was signed in Dihua last July. However, the Chinese authorities have not been able to control the rebel areas, and Chinese people are not allowed to enter these areas. Ahmatjan claims he is not a separatist, but seeks political reform, and once implemented, will fully respect Chinese sovereignty. The Chinese authorities accuse Ahmatjan of seeking to establish a pro-Soviet provincial government and have stated that he has not complied with the agreement for the past year, nor does he intend to comply. The traitors are attacking the highways connecting Xinjiang with the outside world, the unrest is gradually spreading, and they are demanding the replacement of the newly appointed provincial chairman, Masud Sabri.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Opposes US Proposal: Japanese Peace Conference Unlikely; China to State Position at Appropriate Time</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 19th (Radio): Due to Soviet opposition, the preliminary meeting of the eleven-nation Japanese peace conference cannot begin next month. Washington officials have expressed they have given up hope that the meeting will be held as scheduled. At the same time, the British have also advocated for postponement.</p>
<p>The Soviet Embassy in the United States lodged a protest with the US State Department today, stating: "Assistant US Secretary of State Hilldring's statement that he would consult with the embassy personnel of the other ten member states of the Far Eastern Commission on the issue of their countries' participation in the Japanese peace treaty on the 11th is inaccurate, as Soviet embassy personnel were neither invited nor did they participate in this discussion."</p>
<p>Another dispatch: The US government has recently responded to the Soviet allegations. It is claimed: Soviet representatives were among those invited to a meeting on July 11 between the US Assistant Secretary of State and diplomatic representatives from various countries of the Far Eastern Commission, but did not attend.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 19th] Sources say: China will submit a formal reply to the US proposal to convene a preliminary Japanese peace conference at an appropriate time, and will simultaneously issue a statement to clarify our country's position. It is understood that the existence of the Big Four veto power makes the voting method one of the decisive factors as to whether the conference can open satisfactorily. While the Soviet Union advocates for first convening a foreign ministers' meeting, the United States proposes that the eleven nations convene directly and adopt a two-thirds majority vote. The two sides are quite far apart. In order for the Japanese peace treaty to reach a conclusion as soon as possible, China may have exchanged views with relevant countries on this point. It is also reported that our side will suggest a compromise voting method, adopting a two-thirds majority vote, but this two-thirds majority must include the Big Four. We have no preconceptions about the date of the meeting, but hope that it will be held as soon as possible under the premise that all eleven countries can participate. As for the issue of compensation for the Japanese puppet industrial equipment and materials lost by our country in the Northeast in the event that the Soviet Union refuses to participate, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also studying the matter.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] Regarding the United States' hope to begin the preliminary Japanese peace conference on August 19, the United Kingdom has today put forward a counter-proposal to postpone it, and also suggested that the Foreign Ministers of the Big Four personally lead their respective delegations. According to the State Department, the United Kingdom has now submitted a formal memorandum stating: Since the British Commonwealth is scheduled to hold a meeting in Canberra on August 26, it opposes convening the preliminary Japanese peace conference on August 19. It is understood that among the eleven members of the Far Eastern Commission, only the Netherlands has accepted the US proposal unconditionally. Australia and New Zealand hold the same position as the United Kingdom. The Soviet Union has not yet replied.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, San Francisco, 19th] The San Francisco Chamber of Commerce cabled Secretary of State Marshall on the 19th, requesting that the Japanese peace conference be held there. It said that the city was a major port for the departure of war personnel and supplies to the front lines during the war, so the Chamber of Commerce believes it would be very appropriate to sign the peace treaty there.</p>
<h3>Japanese Affairs Expert Discusses: A Japanese Peace Conference Method That Favors the US is Detrimental to Us</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] A certain "Japanese affairs expert" recently told reporters: There are three ways to convene the Japanese peace conference, namely (1) convened by the four countries of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union; (2) convened by the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission; and (3) the method currently advocated by the United States, with decisions made by a two-thirds majority vote of the participating countries. Under the first method, our country has one-quarter of the speaking rights and possesses veto power. Under the second method, our country has only one-eleventh of the speaking rights, but also has veto power. Under the last method, our country no longer has the power to veto. The United Kingdom can increase its speaking power due to the support of its territories. Our country's speaking power exists only in name. In the Japanese peace treaty, our country's interests are not consistent with those of the United States, so the issue of this method cannot be ignored. In terms of the treaty itself, our country has paid attention to two points in the past: First, the complete eradication of Japan's military power so that it does not become a threat to our country and the world. Second, the democratization of Japanese politics, but we do not advocate adopting a policy of retaliation. In future military clauses of the Japanese peace treaty, it will be easy to achieve due to the unified goals of the United Nations. Political democracy can also be gradually realized. However, in the past, our country's government and the public have not studied the economic sector of Japan enough, and there is still no accurate and detailed information that can be used as a reference for decision-making. In terms of Sino-Japanese trade, the nature of the goods should be analyzed in detail before deciding whether to import them, so as to seek mutual benefit. A general rejection of trade is an impractical solution in the current situation. In terms of the overall situation in the Far East, the situation in Korea deserves attention. If the United States and the Soviet Union break down in negotiations on Korea, the barriers in the Far East will become even more distinct. The current US foreign policy is a strategic guidance policy, and China, Japan, and Korea are links in the Eastern front. Wedemeyer's arrival can also be viewed from this perspective.</p>
<h3>Hoover Speaks in the House</h3>
<p>Advocates for Separate Peace with Germany and Japan</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] Former US President Hoover recently told the House Appropriations Committee: It is easier for the United States to negotiate a separate peace with Japan than with Germany, but Korea may need to be supervised for another 25 years. Since the Soviet Union is hindering progress in Europe and also hindering the unification of Korea, I advocate that the United States should negotiate a separate peace with Germany, so as to reduce the burden on taxpayers for supporting the Germans and the cost of the occupying forces. In short, as long as the Soviet Union's current attitude does not change, there will never be a solution. Therefore, on the Korean issue, if the Soviet Union occupies North Korea, we should strive to maintain South Korea ourselves.</p>
<h3>Luo Jialun's Speech in India: The Chinese View of Life</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 18th] Our Ambassador to India, Luo Jialun, delivered a speech on the Chinese view of life at the Rotary Club banquet last night and answered various questions about modern social problems in our country. The questioners were interested in our country's philosophy and life, and unanimously pointed out the similarities between the Chinese and Indian viewpoints, and the need for closer cultural contact between the two sides. Ambassador Luo's speech was extremely clear and concise, and the audience was moved. He said: "The Chinese people, in general, tend towards political moderation and prefer a gradual process of evolutionary reform." He deeply hoped that "all of us in the world will be able to use our wisdom in the future to create a civilization that has all the advantages of the Indian sari (Note: The sari is the clothing worn by Indian women. If worn properly, it is elegant and comfortable), and not a civilization of clothing that is so small as to make one suffocate. This kind of clothing restricts life and will eventually lead to tragedy."</p>

<h3>Rumor That Puyi Has Died</h3>
<p>Committed Suicide in Changchun After "August 15th"</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 18th] A former attendant in the puppet emperor Puyi's palace recently read a United Press telegram from Tokyo on the 17th regarding the news that Puyi had left Khabarovsk. The phrase "accompanied by his brother Pujie" is incorrect. He said: Puyi shot himself with a pistol at his residence in Changchun a few days after "August 15th." Note: Pujie graduated from the Japanese Army Academy and served as a major instructor at the puppet Manchukuo military officer school, marrying the daughter of a Japanese aristocrat, Saga Hiroko. His wife was detained by our side when the Japanese expatriates were repatriated.</p>
<h3>Naming Ceremony for the Anti-Japanese War Memorial City of Hengyang: Chairman Chiang Issues Special Instructions, Announcing the Meaning of "The Benevolent are Invincible" to the Nation</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Hengyang, 18th] At the naming ceremony for the Anti-Japanese War Memorial City of Hengyang, Chairman Chiang issued instructions in the following telegram: "During the eight years of the War of Resistance, there were over a hundred major battles and countless minor battles, but the Battle of Hengyang, in terms of its duration, the intensity of sacrifice, the magnitude of its impact, and the greatness of its contribution, was particularly shocking to the world. Since 1932, the Allied naval counteroffensive in the Pacific has been winning victory after victory. The Japanese, seeing their maritime transportation obstructed, planned to open up land transportation, hoping to reach southern Guangdong from the puppet Manchuria through the Beining Railway, Pinghan Railway, and Yuehan Railway. The Hengyang railway section in the middle was still in the hands of our army, so they spared no effort to mobilize their elite troops and launch a full-scale offensive. Starting in February of the 33rd year of the Republic, they mobilized ten divisions and several special units to attack from different directions. Our army was less well-equipped, but our morale was high, and we calmly fought back, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy everywhere. By late June of this year, the counties surrounding Hengyang had fallen one after another. The remaining troops of our 10th Army, covered in blood, defended this isolated city for as long as 48 days. This is a rare miracle in the world, and the most prominent manifestation and expression of the inherent moral spirit of our China. This is why local people have requested that Hengyang be designated as an Anti-Japanese War Memorial City. Mencius said, 'The benevolent are invincible.' He also said, 'A vast, flowing energy, born from the accumulation of righteousness, is supremely great and strong.' What our Chinese nation relies on to survive and prosper is the deep and far-reaching influence of the teachings of benevolence and righteousness for thousands of years? Now, as we hold the naming ceremony, I hereby cite this meaning to inform the people of the country and to show it to future generations. Chiang Kai-shek."</p>
<h3>Seeking the Return of Seized Items from Japan: Allied Headquarters Has Not Stipulated a Deadline; Requests Can Still Be Submitted After July</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] Officials from the Compensation and Restitution Group of our delegation to Japan told reporters this morning: The group has so far processed 140 requests for the return of seized ships from Japan, and 25 requests for the return of machinery. They urged people in China to speed up these compensation claims and stressed that these claims must provide full and detailed evidence. It is claimed that requests can still be submitted after July, as Allied Headquarters has not set a deadline for this, nor has the Far Eastern Commission, the policy-making body. In August last year, the Far Eastern Commission stipulated that requests for the requisition of industrial and transport machinery and equipment found in Japan should not delay the transfer of machines and equipment to be used for compensation in general. However, items related to restitution claims that have already been received by Allied Headquarters must not be allocated as compensation materials before action is taken on the claims. On the other hand, compensation materials that have already been allocated to designated countries must not be listed as restitution items. They stressed that there is still no deadline. It is reported that among the 25 requests for the return of machinery, one is a paper mill that was moved from Guangzhou to Hokkaido by the Japanese during the war. It is generally believed to be the second largest in the world. Another request was submitted by the Northwest Industrial Corporation, including 3,000 pieces of machinery. Regarding the ship restitution requests, only five ships have been recovered, 40 have been sunk and need to be salvaged, and others need major repairs.</p>

<h3>Canal Water Rises Sharply in Northern Jiangsu: 17 Breaches in Dike Along the Su-Si Section; Communist Bandits Seize the Opportunity to Sabotage, Making Rescue Difficult</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Zhenjiang, 19th] Due to continuous rain, the water level in the Yi, Mu, and Canal has risen sharply. There are as many as seventeen breaches in the canal dike along the Su-Si section. The authorities are currently rushing to repair the breaches day and night. The Yi River's surge is particularly fierce, with the water level in the Tanji area rising to 24.98 meters and continuing to rise. The Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau has mobilized hundreds of workers day and night to rush to the rescue. The northern banks of the Fangting and Bulao rivers have been flooded. Both sides of the canal dike are covered with water, making it impossible to collect soil. Furthermore, there are strong winds and huge waves, which are insurmountable by human effort. At the same time, there are nine breaches downstream of Tanji. The area was previously occupied by the Communist bandits, making it impossible to carry out engineering work. Now they are taking the opportunity to sabotage the rescue work, making it even more difficult. Governor Wang of Jiangsu Province and Director Dong of the Construction Department, in view of the fact that it is now during the flood season, and that a breach is truly worrying if the water level continues to rise, believe that flood prevention and rescue are the most urgent tasks in northern Jiangsu. They have telegraphed relevant counties to mobilize the people and collect materials to cooperate with the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau to strive for repairs, and have also urgently telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Water Conservancy Department to request that the flood prevention funds be quickly allocated. In addition, they have already raised a large sum of money from the provincial treasury to be allocated to the Canal Engineering Bureau for application.</p>

<h3>Reports of Existing Commercial Firms Merging are Inaccurate</h3>
<p>Statements from Finance Ministry Official</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing, 19th] An official from the Ministry of Finance denied rumors that the ministry plans to merge existing commercial firms. According to him: "The current market is changing rapidly, and speculation is harmful. The financial sector should undoubtedly bear some responsibility. While it is true that the number of existing commercial firms exceeds actual needs, and although some have made this suggestion, the ministry has no such plans. This is because it would be difficult to implement and standards would be impossible to determine. Taking Nanjing as an example, it is impossible to determine how many firms should be established based on subjective judgment or objective data. Furthermore, some firms are sound and well-funded, while others are weak and empty. Even among established firms, some are unstable, while newly established firms are often well-funded. Therefore, it is impossible to rigidly stipulate how many firms should be merged or how the mergers should be carried out. Such rumors are not credible."</p>

<h3>Greening the Nation</h3>
<p>Designating Beijing, Tianjin, and Henan as Demonstration Areas; Establishing a Ten-Year Afforestation Plan</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] In order to green the nation and supply timber, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has been actively promoting seedling cultivation and afforestation work in various regions for the past six years, with considerable success. This year, upon the order of Chairman Chiang, Nanjing suburbs, the Western Hills of Beiping, and Mount Song in Henan have been designated as demonstration forest areas to promote comprehensive afforestation in various regions. Each of these areas has established a ten-year afforestation plan, to be completed starting this year. More than 600 million yuan has been allocated, and the Central Forestry Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will cultivate seedlings in the above three locations to actively prepare for afforestation starting next year.</p>
<h3>Weekly Forum: Pay Attention to the National Culture of Xinjiang!</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yingpeng</p>
<p>Xinjiang was invaded by Mongolian troops, who had just seceded from the community of nations less than two years prior. The whole country was shocked. Recently, the secessionist movement in the Ili region has spread to Kashgar. Many Ili residents have joined the Soviet Union, and Soviet workers are mining in the Xinjiang border area. The situation in Dihua is tense, with frequent acts of terrorism. This series of continuous bad news makes the Chinese people more worried.</p>
<p>The entanglement of the Xinjiang problem initially stemmed from the cultural differences between the ethnic groups, which prevented them from understanding each other and created obstacles. In addition, the mishandling by successive political leaders inevitably led to disputes. Unfortunately, they were tempted by external forces. Those who are generally indecisive, short-sighted, and prone to reckless actions easily fall into their trap and are exploited without realizing it. Therefore, the secessionist movement is more worrying than the occupation of land. The Chinese people should pay special attention to it, and make preparations in advance. This responsibility lies not only with the government but must be shared by the people. The government is responsible for dealing with internal affairs, diplomacy, and military matters, so I will not discuss them here. From the people's perspective, the primary task should be to strengthen the unity between the mainland and the local ethnic groups. In other words, we must seek close connections with each other, achieve mutual understanding and mutual support, and achieve complete harmony, like hands and feet, inseparable.</p>
<p>The connection between the people is economic in terms of material things and cultural in terms of spirit. In the past, the people of the mainland and Xinjiang were very unfamiliar with each other. Although the provincial government of Xinjiang has moved towards reform after the victory, the exchange of economies between the two sides cannot be discussed for the time being due to the inconvenience of transportation. The work that needs to be carried out urgently and cannot be delayed any longer should be cultural exchange. Originally, culture is the precursor of politics, and politics cannot be separated from the basis of culture. The culture of Xinjiang is very different from that of the mainland. We know that its relationship is very important from various aspects such as history, geography, ethnicity, and religion. This is not only a touchstone for national unity within the country but also worthy of attention for the possible impact on the overall Asian situation and the future religious civilization of the world. We must help the government take steady and lasting measures in administration, and we must help the people of Xinjiang prepare to defend the country and cope with the future situation. We must first have a deep understanding of Xinjiang culture. At the same time, the people of Xinjiang must also have a deep understanding of mainland culture.</p>
<p>Speaking of Xinjiang culture, the period of the Han and Tang dynasties has become a thing of the past and cannot be traced. In recent times, we must first mention the Uyghur ethnic group. The Uyghur ethnic group is now the most populous ethnic group in Xinjiang. It is estimated that there are three million people (including Taranchi), accounting for 70% of the province's population. Therefore, it occupies the most important position in Xinjiang. The second is the Kazakh ethnic group, with a population of about 400,000. The former is the representative of the "settled country," and the latter is the representative of the "mobile country."</p>
<p>The Uyghur ethnic group is the ancient Huihe. During the Northern Song Dynasty, their descendants led other Turkic people to occupy Xinjiang and the entire Central Asia, establishing the Kara-Khanid Khanate, with its capital in today's Kashgar. Its cultural and military achievements were brilliant for a time. After the Arab Empire, it was the cultural leader of Central Asia. Today's Turkey—that is, the Turkic people—was just a small tribe in the far west at that time. Its culture has been maintained for a long time, up to the present, and is not affected by political changes. As for the Sak people, they are the best knights in the world and the typical nomadic people. Other ethnic groups such as Uzbek, Tajik, Kyrgyz, etc. (the total population is 150,000 people) all belong to the same system of culture. Therefore, in terms of politics, all ethnic groups in Xinjiang were originally one part of the Chinese nation, but their culture is called Turkic Islamic culture. Their religion belongs to Islam, their language belongs to the Turkic family, and their customs and habits combine both.</p>
<p>The center of Turkic Islamic culture was the Kara-Khanid Khanate established by the Uyghur ethnic group in the past, and now it is the Republic of Turkey. In addition to Turkey and the ethnic groups in Xinjiang, there are also the Bashkir, Tatar, and Crimean autonomous regions within the Soviet Union, as well as the Kazakh, Uzbek, Kyrgyz, Tajik, Azerbaijani, and Turkmen republics. The above nine republics, because they are affiliated with the Soviet Union, retain only their language and some customs. Everything else has been socialistized, and the original Islamic culture has no room for activity.</p>
<p>The current situation in Xinjiang is the intersection of three major forces. First, the political power exercised by the National Government; second, the Turkic Islamic culture of the people of this province and the Turkic-speaking ethnic movement, that is, the ideal of establishing Turkic-speaking ethnic autonomy; and third, the power of neighboring Soviet Union and the East Turkestan secessionist movement it supports. Today, the nine Turkic-speaking republics belonging to the Soviet Union are originally one family with the blood and culture of the Turkic-speaking ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Among them, the Kazakh, Uzbek, Kyrgyz, Tajik, and Turkmen republics have a total population of no less than 15 million, and their soil is adjacent to that of Xinjiang. The Soviet authorities' claim that "the Ili people who have joined the Soviet Union originally belonged to the Soviet people" in the report is worthy of deep thought. Conversely, can we say that the people of the five republics belonging to the Soviet Union originally belonged to the Chinese people? The situation in Xinjiang is so complicated that if we fail to handle it properly, the result will be very different. On the contrary, even if the environment is complex, we can still find a favorable path. It is up to people to make it happen, and those with clear vision will be able to understand and obtain it.</p>
<p>The origin of the Turkic-speaking ethnic autonomy movement began with the youth of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang being influenced by the "Pan-Turkic movement" and having ideals for the establishment of modern politics. In addition to the Uyghur ethnic group, the leading figures of the Kazakh ethnic group, in particular, are more earnest in their expectations for modern political construction and their emotions for national unity. They have witnessed the modern construction of the Turkic-speaking republics belonging to the neighboring Soviet Union and cannot help but feel envious, but they also know the sadness of being a vassal. They have not lost their heart of allegiance to the Central Government, but the negative feelings about the corruption of the provincial government in the past are not easy to eliminate for a while. Especially because the government lacks understanding of Xinjiang's inherent culture and its new ideals, it feels that there is not enough maintenance and support. This is the real key to the Xinjiang problem.</p>
<p>The current guiding principle of the government's politics in Xinjiang is probably to accept General Zhang Zhizhong's suggestion to implement democratization and modernization and to respect its inherent culture as the first priority. This is originally a wise measure and worthy of praise. Since we know that the focus of Xinjiang politics is on culture, we feel that if we think from the perspective of national unity, the effect of relying solely on the government's efforts to maintain it is still superficial and temporary. Both peoples must work together to make Xinjiang culture and mainland culture exchange and promote each other, and the cultural connection will generate emotions of mutual empathy and sharing of joys and sorrows between ethnic groups, so that they can achieve eternal separation.</p>
<p>The Uyghur culture once occupied a leading position in Central Asia, and it is still the oldest culture among the Turkic-Islamic ethnic groups. We certainly do not harbor any sense of superiority or inferiority, and we should have a heart of love. In particular, we should not repeat the mistakes of our predecessors in forcing Sinicization, which would mislead the goal. We should have a better understanding of the Kazakh ethnic group and eliminate all previous absurd misunderstandings. There are no less than a hundred people from Xinjiang who are stranded in Beijing and Shanghai, and most of them are ambitious people. Among them are political commentators, poets, novelists, historians and geographers, and experts who have studied in the Soviet Union or Turkey and have high academic achievements. They also publish several Turkic-language magazines in Beijing and Shanghai, which are distributed to the Middle East, India, and Egypt. Their content is full of ethnic consciousness and modern ideas. This situation does not seem to have been noticed by the local society. As for the Han people in Xinjiang, during the period when General Zhang Zhizhong was in power, Huang Zhenxia, an expert in Xinjiang studies, established the Xinjiang History and Geography Society in Dihua to communicate Han-Hui culture and harmonize feelings. Many local cultural figures participated. Mr. Huang has recently come to Shanghai again and jointly initiated the Xinjiang Cultural Publishing House with Xinjiang people living in Shanghai. One type of Xinjiang Cultural Pictorial has been published, introducing Xinjiang's customs and arts. Among those in preparation, "A History of Xinjiang" is especially important.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the cultural center of the country. People from all walks of life who care about Xinjiang or are interested in Turkic-Islamic culture should do their duty as citizens and catch up quickly. They should work together with the youth of Xinjiang living in Beijing and Shanghai to form a cultural exchange organization and contact the cultural groups in Xinjiang to exchange cultures with each other. The initial work should be: (1) Both parties organize cultural visits, visit each other, and allow school youth and business people to participate; (2) Universities in Shanghai hire experts and scholars from Xinjiang to set up lectures on Xinjiang issues and its history, geography, and culture; (3) Translate each other's cultural classics and modern works; (4) Publish books and newspapers introducing each other's culture; (5) Exchange exhibitions and performances of painting, music, dance, photography, drama, and film; (6) Make films of each other's customs, places of interest, and characters; (7) Scholars from both parties jointly form academic research groups in history, geography, language, art, religion, and other fields. We want to promote the development of each other's culture and strengthen national unity. This is the minimum requirement. The author sincerely hopes that Shanghai social leaders and enthusiastic people will initiate and work hard to carry out these tasks as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Finally, there is an important opinion that should be added. The central country of the Turkic-Islamic culture is now the Republic of Turkey. The diplomatic relations between our country and Turkey have always been very friendly. The experience of Turkey's revival can serve as a good reference for us. In addition, the current international environment in which Turkey is located is similar to that of our country. Due to the promotion of Xinjiang's cultural work, we must also seek cultural ties with Turkey. It is best to go a step further and organize the Sino-Turkish Cultural Association to deepen the exchange of documents between the two countries and enhance the friendship between the people of the two countries. This will be of great benefit to both parties in dealing with the situation in Central Asia. I especially hope that the government authorities will pay attention to this.</p>

<h3>U.S. Foreign Aid Bill Passed Swiftly by the House of Representatives, Appropriating $1.6 Billion to Aid Disaster-Stricken Countries</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 19th] Amidst reports of the Greek war front and the widening rift between the Soviet Union and Western nations, the House of Representatives last night approved a foreign appropriation of $1,600,319,900 to support U.S. foreign policy. This includes: (1) $400 million for Greece and Turkey; (2) $332 million for relief in China, Austria, Italy, and the Free Territory of Trieste; (3) $550 million for the expenses of the U.S. military government in occupied areas such as Japan, Korea, and Germany; (4) $71,102,400 for the International Refugee Organization fund.</p>
<p>The House adopted a voice vote system, passing the appropriation in just one hour. Considering the magnitude and complexity of the international significance of this bill, such an achievement would be unprecedented in peacetime. Key figures in government and foreign affairs presented their views, some of which will remain confidential. Members of Congress repeatedly called for a halt to aid to countries within the Soviet sphere of influence. Representative Taber, Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, assured everyone that the funds would not be used to assist countries that are ideologically or economically linked to the Soviet Union, unless "they change course and are willing to work together with freedom-believing nations."</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 18th] The U.S. House Appropriations Committee has recently passed a $1,350,302,400 foreign aid bill, including $400 million for aid to Greece and Turkey. The committee reduced the UNRRA extension expenses for China, Poland, Italy, Hungary, Austria, Greece, and Trieste by $18 million to $350 million. This foreign aid of over $1.3 billion is included in the additional appropriation of $1.602 billion for this year, which is $3.131 billion lower than the government's request. The approved foreign aid is also $177,476,600 less than the original proposal, including a reduction of $177,476,600 from the $725 million requested by the military for relief in the occupied zones of Japan, Korea, Germany, and Austria. Former President Hoover had urged the committee not to cut the military's request. Regarding the $18 million reduction in relief funds for liberated countries such as China, Poland, and Italy, the committee stated that this was because certain countries should not receive aid. Although the committee did not specify which countries, it is generally believed that this refers to Poland and Hungary.</p>

<h3>British Warships Intercept Jewish Immigrant Ship, Fierce Fighting Erupts, Jews in the Holy Land Strike and Close Shops in Protest</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 18th] Tonight, 4,500 Jewish illegal immigrants from the 4,277-ton "President Warfield" which arrived at Haifa, have been transferred to ferries today for deportation to Cyprus. When the British Navy boarded the ship 17 miles offshore before dawn today, clashes occurred with the refugees on board. Fifty British soldiers carrying steel rods boarded the ship. Two Jews allegedly attempted to chop off the head of a British soldier with an axe, and British troops opened fire. Fierce fighting ensued, with both sides using tear gas, smoke bombs, and steam jets. Official reports indicate that three British soldiers were injured. The Jewish underground organization Haganah's secret telegrams stated that one Jew was killed and 125 were injured, including 25 seriously injured. Two of the five British cruisers and destroyers chasing the ship were damaged. Two hundred thousand Jews in Tel Aviv went on a sympathy strike upon hearing the news of the attack on the "President Warfield," with all stores and businesses closing down. A similar demonstration also occurred in the Jewish quarter of Haifa. The incident on the Jewish refugee ship was the first of its kind. According to Jewish sources, the ship carried 1,600 Jewish men, 1,282 women, 1,007 teenagers, and 655 children. The Jewish underground organization Haganah sent a letter to the United Nations Palestine Investigation Committee to prevent the Jews on the "President Warfield" from being deported to Cyprus. After reporting to Haganah Radio, the British Foreign Office released a detailed report accusing several American trading companies of assisting Jews in secretly immigrating to Palestine. It stated that these companies, ostensibly engaged in the fruit business, were actually using secret codes to assist Jews in secretly immigrating to Palestine, such as the word "banana," which was used to represent "ships carrying Jews illegally into Palestine." A report received by the British authorities specifically pointed out the Western Trading Corporation. Officials believe that the company's activities are, at the very least, very mysterious. The headquarters of the Western Trading Corporation is located in an old building on Stone Street in New York and is managed by a Colonel William, assisted by three people: Nathan Cohen, Bert Cohen, and Barnes. The company ostensibly engages in the fruit business. The "Exodus 1947," originally named the "President Warfield," was a ship purchased by the Western Trading Corporation. On February 25, 1947, the ship departed from Baltimore en route to China, but on April 30, it suddenly appeared in the Italian port of Spezia. Thirty percent of the sailors on board were young Jews with no maritime experience. The ship then left the port of Spezia on June 12 and sailed to the French port of Sete, where it boarded 4,500 Jews. The Jews obtained visas stating their destination as Colombia, but yesterday they suddenly appeared off the coast of Palestine. The Western Trading Corporation also has two other ships, one named "Trade Wind," which is currently anchored outside Palestine and cannot enter the port, and another named "Northland," which is currently docked in the French port of Bayonne.</p>

<h3>U.S. Congress Reintroduces Tax Cut Bill, Truman Vetoes Again, Senate Reconsiders and Accepts</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 18th] President Truman vetoed the second individual income tax bill today, stating that it was "still an untimely mistake." The Senate also supported the veto, ensuring that there is no chance of the tax cut passing in this session of Congress. The President sent a special message to Congress, vetoing the $4 billion tax cut bill. Shortly thereafter, the House voted to override the veto. However, the Senate once again supported the President's veto.</p>
<p>Reduced Government Revenue Affects European Aid Program</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 18th] In President Truman's message to Congress vetoing the tax cut bill, he stated that the reduction in income tax will affect the obligations that the United States should bear under the Marshall Plan for European aid, and that the responsibility of the United States for international reconstruction is also of great importance to the efforts of the United States to obtain lasting peace. The recent refusal of certain countries to participate in the common effort to build a world of stability has made the task of the United States even more difficult, and it is inappropriate to reduce government revenue and hinder the government's ability to fulfill its obligations. The nature of the tax cut is wrong, and the timing of the tax cut is even more inappropriate. The United States is still burdened with heavy obligations arising from the war, and defense spending is enormous. Any budget surplus should first be used to repay public debt.</p>
<p>Unprecedented Prosperity in the United States Makes it Inappropriate to Stimulate Prices</p>
<p>In general, tax cuts not only represent an imperfect tax policy but also contribute to inflationary pressures. There is no reasonable justification for tax cuts before prices stabilize and before business, employment, and national income reach perfect levels. The general level of business activity in the United States is continuing to move towards a high peak, and the number of employed people continues to increase. The number of employed people in June was the highest record in our country's history, and there are no obvious signs of a decline in this unprecedented prosperity. Tax cuts will hinder the adjustment of wages and prices necessary to maintain high prosperity, stimulate the rise in consumer goods prices, and increase the risk of recession.</p>
<p>Heated Debate Between Parties in the Senate Reconsideration Session</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] After President Truman vetoed the tax cut bill, the Senate reconsidered it. During the session, Senate Democratic Leader Barkley gave a speech, urging the Senate to accept the President's veto, and said that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov "sabotaged" the recent European Economic Conference held in Paris, but that the door remains open for countries that have refused to participate in the conference to join the Marshall Plan for European aid in the future. Senate Republican Leader Taft then spoke, expressing support for the main principles of the Marshall Plan for European aid, but believing that tax cuts are very consistent with this plan.</p>
<h3>U.S. House Committee Passes Universal Military Training Bill for Youth</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] San Francisco, 19th Broadcast: The U.S. House Armed Services Committee subcommittee passed a bill for universal military training for U.S. youth, stipulating that youths aged 18 to 20 must undergo six months of basic military training and then serve six months in the reserves.</p>
<h3>Truman Signs Presidential Succession Act</h3>
<p>Speaker of the House is Second in Line of Succession</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] A bill making the Speaker of the House the second in line of succession in the event of the President's retirement or death was signed into law today by President Truman. According to the bill, the order of succession to the President is as follows: Vice President, Speaker of the House, President Pro Tempore of the Senate, Secretary of State, and other cabinet members. Previously, the Secretary of State was second in line.</p>
<h3>Hand Grenades Found in U.S. Residential Area in Tokyo</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 19th] The U.S. military criminal division announced that twenty Japanese-made hand grenades were found in "Washington Heights," the U.S. residential area in Tokyo, and have been destroyed. The area was formerly a Japanese military camp, and U.S. authorities have continued to search the area.</p>
<h3>Japan Actively Rebuilding its Economy, Economic Stabilization Board Plans to Reach Wartime Production Standards</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] In order to rebuild its economy, the Japanese government has decided to quickly formulate a long-term economic reconstruction plan and has established a long-term economic reconstruction committee within the Economic Stabilization Board. The basic policy of this reconstruction plan is reportedly to aim to restore 80% of the average standard of living between 1930 and 1934 from this year to 1950 or even 1952. The planned coal production volume for 1952 is 45 million tons. According to the U.S. Pauley reparations plan, Japan is only allowed to generally retain its production capacity from 1930, but this plan has not yet been adopted. In fact, the production capacity of 1930, which is also the production capacity before Japan's invasion of Northeast China, is now being used as the production target for 1930 to 1934, and rebuilding the Japanese economy is tantamount to using the production capacity after the "September 18th" Incident as the reconstruction target. The impact of this move on our country is extremely significant and cannot be taken lightly.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 19th] The Japanese Economic Stabilization Board announced on the 19th that it has drafted eight special plans to raise Japan's industrial production level to the level of 1930 to 1934 within three years. Problems such as the allocation of fuel, electricity, raw materials, daily necessities, as well as transportation and manpower, are included. The drafters of the plan hope that Japan can obtain foreign capital and state that it can be repaid by 1952. The plan will be submitted to the government on the 15th of next month.</p>
<h3>American Engineering Experts Go to Japan to Assist in Reconstruction</h3>
<p>[United Press International, New York, 18th] Thirty American engineers are scheduled to go to Japan around August 1 to thoroughly investigate the country's industrial situation. Each engineer specializes in a specific field and will work under the guidance of the Department of the Army and General MacArthur's headquarters. According to the head of the delegation, Sterk, the purpose of the organization is to revitalize the Japanese economy, restore the Japanese machine tool and hardware market, and prepare a comprehensive technical study of the reparations issue. The final reparations plan has not yet been decided. Japanese industry is practically at a standstill, and Japanese factories must have an approved production level in order to revitalize them. The delegation's inspection report will serve as the basis for the revival of Japanese industry.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cultural Circles Association Plans to Connect with the United Nations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] More than 100 leaders of Japanese cultural circles established an organization today in Sendai, northeast of Tokyo, with the aim of establishing relations with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as a "preliminary step for Japan to join the United Nations."

<h3>Japanese Concealed Goods Case, Various Parties Attack Each Other</h3>
<p>Has Developed into a Political Issue</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] The Japanese concealed goods case has recently developed into a political issue, with various parties attacking each other. However, because the case involves a wide range of people, the attacking forces are also dispersed. Even various parties are related to this issue. The case occurred four months ago, when a concealed goods handling committee was established in the Economic Stabilization Board. The disclosed goods were mostly military supplies when Japan surrendered. Calculated at the prices at that time, they were worth approximately 100 billion yen. Afterwards, they were gradually sold on black markets such as Ginza in Tokyo. Although the committee announced that it would offer 20% as a "bonus," it was never able to trace the source. Currently, the general public here believes that this matter can also be used as a test of the administrative efficiency of the Katayama Cabinet.</p>

<h3>Two Airlines' Price Increase Approved by Ministry of Communications; Air Transport Passenger and Freight Rates to Increase Tomorrow; Maximum Increase 120 Percent, Minimum 50 Percent; Company Officials Say Still Far from Target</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The issue of increasing air fares and freight rates, which has been brewing for over a month, was approved yesterday by the Ministry of Communications in an order to China and Central Airlines. The new prices will be implemented starting tomorrow (July 21st). The passenger ticket price increases vary depending on the route, with the highest being 120% for the Xi'an-Lanzhou route and the lowest being 50% for the South China route to Guangzhou and Hong Kong. The remaining increases are around 70% to 80%. Freight prices will increase proportionally, with newspapers still calculated at 60% of the rate. The two airlines have been applying for these fare and freight rate increases for a long time, and they have repeatedly sent senior officials to the capital to lobby the Ministry of Communications authorities. The Ministry of Communications is well aware of the airlines' inability to offset expenses, so it has long agreed to the price increase. However, because it had to be approved by the Executive Yuan, it has been delayed until now. It was originally rumored that the adjustment would take effect on August 1st. In fact, the company authorities had originally planned to start implementing it as early as July 10th. After the price adjustment, the two companies' business situation will greatly improve. However, according to company officials, because most of the expenses are paid in US dollar foreign exchange, it is still far from the target. If the development of the aviation industry is to be sought, a fundamental solution must be found. As for how to fundamentally solve this, it is said that the company authorities are already planning. The price list after the adjustment from Shanghai to various places is listed below:</p>

After receiving the order, the Council believes that the power of the various subcommittee meetings is limited to deliberating on various continued proposals based on the principles of the resolutions of the general assembly, and they must be submitted to the next general assembly for ratification afterwards. There is no transcendence of the authority of the general assembly, and the cases submitted by the municipal government of this city are particularly numerous, and some of them are time-sensitive. If they are all left to be discussed at the general assembly once every three months, it will not only be untimely, but also a large number of accumulated cases will take a long time to deliberate. In addition, a temporary general assembly is not convenient to convene without a major accident. Therefore, it was decided to temporarily continue the original method and continue to hold the meeting. On one side, it is still stated the reasons, and a letter is sent to the municipal government to forward it to the central government for record.</p>

Now that victory is nearly two years past, recalling the martyrs who died in the press world is extremely painful! Although the martyrs have died with their ambitions unfulfilled, the War of Resistance was ultimately successful, which is enough to comfort their heroic spirits in the afterlife. And the loyalty and righteousness of the martyrs are enough to last for ten thousand generations.</p>
<p>The central government has previously issued a clear order to commend the fifteen martyrs of the Shanghai press, in addition to the above six, there are Shao Xubai, Feng Mengyun, Zhou Weishan, Qin Zihuan, Zhao Erlu, Wu Hongye, Zhu Mingchun, Wang Anlu, Chen Kunlin and other nine. The families of the martyrs must be struggling, and we hope they will send letters or come to the Society Service Department of this newspaper in person for guidance, and we especially hope that readers will inform each other so that we can make contact and make this matter proceed more smoothly.</p>

<h3>China Airlines Plane; Will Continue to Fly to America</h3>
<p>Delayed Permits Not Intentional</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] China National Aviation Corporation's (CNAC) US-China passenger plane has suspended flights because the US Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) permit has not yet been issued. It is learned that the US CAA has no intention of intentionally delaying the permit. The reason is that CNAC applied too late, only sending the application on June 27. According to US procedures, any application takes at least one month to issue. Based on this calculation, it should be issued at the end of this month or early next month. Although the permit has not been issued, it does not affect the chartered flight, so CNAC may continue flying on August 1.</p>

<h3>Film Ticket Prices; Social Bureau Shows Intent to Approve</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The request from all cinemas in the city to double ticket prices from the 24th of this month is still under review by the Social Bureau. Yesterday, Director Wu told reporters that doubling the price is too much. If the cinema thinks that the price increase is due to the increased cost of opening air conditioning, it must guarantee that the price will drop when the weather turns cool and the air conditioning stops operating. Currently, the government has a part of foreign exchange subsidies for the film industry, so the price should not be doubled. The amount of increase the Social Bureau will approve has not yet been determined.</p>

Fujian Agricultural and Forestry Company Breached Contract Ordering Railroad Ties but Did Not Deliver Goods</p>
<h3>Two Railway Bureaus Sue</h3>
<p>Fujian Agricultural and Forestry Company Breached Contract Ordering Railroad Ties but Did Not Deliver Goods</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Railway Administration recently filed a lawsuit in the District Court, suing the Fujian Provincial Agricultural and Forestry Company for breach of contract. Last winter, the bureau needed railroad ties urgently and ordered 50,000 ties from the Fujian Provincial Agricultural and Forestry Company, for a total of 550 million yuan. It was agreed that the goods would be delivered in March, and half of the deposit was paid at that time. After the company signed the contract, it purchased from Taiwan. However, the Taiwan provincial authorities did not allow exports. Then, the February 28 Incident occurred in Taiwan. The company sent a letter to the Railway Bureau requesting termination of the contract on the grounds that it could not purchase, and was willing to be responsible for compensating 30% of the loss. The Railway Bureau replied agreeing in principle, but the company was unable to pay the Railway Bureau's deposit and loss compensation due to financial difficulties. Although the Railway Bureau repeatedly urged, it did not respond. At the beginning of last month, the Railway Bureau urgently needed to replace the railroad ties, so it sent a letter to the company asking it to perform the contract as soon as possible. At the same time, it sent a letter to the Taiwan Provincial Government to negotiate. The Taiwan Province approved a special permit to export railroad ties for the Railway Bureau's use. After hearing the news, the company hired a special ship to transport them. However, recently the price of railroad ties skyrocketed. The company sold more than 20,000 railroad ties that had been transported, at a high price of 180,000 yuan per tie, to Sentai Wood Company (8,000 ties) and Zhongxing Wood Industry Company (3,100 ties). The matter was discovered by the Railway Bureau, and the police department of the bureau sent officers to seal the railroad ties. At the same time, it filed a lawsuit in the District Court suing the company for breach of contract, obstructing national transportation projects, and demanding compensation for losses.</p>

Police officer Liu Cong, number 160, of the North Station Police Bureau, noticed and stepped forward to interfere. Several soldiers nearby, who were taking a walk, saw their superior being humiliated and came to confront him, resulting in a conflict. Afterwards, Police Officer Liu rushed back to the precinct to report that he had been beaten. The Judicial Section ordered staff member Chen Yixuan to lead the police to the supply depot's dormitory building on the overpass of Yongkang Lane on Qudao Road to investigate. After reporting the intelligence to the Zhabei Gendarmerie Team, they sent officers to take Li Hongao away for investigation.</p>
<h3>Lin Xingji Suspected of Collusion with the Enemy; Implicates Jiang Weibin Who Was Secretly Reported</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Shen Wanqian, the former commander of the 23rd Gendarmerie Regiment, arrested Lin Xingji, a Fujianese, on suspicion of colluding with the enemy while in office. Later, Jiang Weibin, another Fujianese, after being introduced by Jiang Gongmei, discussed with Shen Wanqian to release Lin on bail.</p>
<p>Lin Yongping and four others secretly reported to the Garrison Command, saying that Jiang Weibin, also known as Bin, originally named Jiang Henghao, used a false name when Fuzhou fell for the second time to carry out interception on the upper reaches of various villages, robbing countless merchants and civilians fleeing the disaster. After being sued by the booksellers and civilians in a joint name to the Fujian Provincial Government, Jiang fled to Shanghai, where he speculated and hoarded goods, remaining at large. After the victory, he colluded with Gendarmerie Captain Jiang Gongmei to help with the takeover. After Jiang's case was exposed, Jiang disappeared again in Hangzhou. The Fujian Provincial Government's order to arrest Jiang has not yet been revoked. Please send a letter to the Fujian Provincial Government to investigate and punish him, so as not to let him slip through the net. As for Lin Xingji's bribery, according to reliable sources, Jiang also received tens of millions of yuan. The case has been transferred by the Inspection Office of the Garrison Command to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. He was once summoned, but Xu Shaobai, who lives in Jiang's house, replied to the District Prosecutor's Office that Jiang was ill in Fujian and has not returned, and cannot appear in court for questioning at present.</p>

<h3>French Concession Tram; Unemployed Workers on a Day and Night Hunger Strike; Get Satisfactory Answer</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] More than 300 drivers, ticket sellers, and ticket inspectors of the French Concession Tram Company who were dismissed during and before the war for various reasons went to the main company in Lujiawan the day before yesterday to request reinstatement, but did not get satisfactory results. They gathered in the company's lobby and corridors, stating that they would go on a hunger strike without hindering the company's administration and transportation, and would not leave until the matter was resolved. After a day and night, the police bureau sent police to maintain order yesterday morning, and a small conflict occurred with the employees.

<h3>Relief Rice Profiteering Case; Schools Receive Very Little; Diverted to Rice Stores</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the case of "UNRRA" relief rice being resold for profit, those arrested by the police are still minor figures. It is reported that this case involves a great deal and the investigation is time-consuming. For the sake of prudence, the police bureau will not issue a statement until the main perpetrators are arrested. However, according to what this reporter has learned, this relief rice was originally distributed to various schools in the jurisdiction of the UNRRA Su Ning branch, totaling more than 3,000 bags, each bag weighing 100 pounds net. However, the number of these relief rice that schools actually get to receive is very small, most of which are diverted to rice stores in the Beijing-Shanghai area. As of yesterday, the arrested suspects confessed to selling more than 700 bags that passed through their hands. It is generally speculated that the inside story of this case may be caused by the following three reasons: (1) Branch officials take advantage of their position to collude with school authorities to embezzle and pre-sell the relief rice; (2) school authorities withhold the rice after receiving it and sell it privately; (3) school teachers and staff sell rice to rice stores or exchange it for good white rice because the quality of the rice is not good. The arrested suspects include He Junsheng, the owner of Zhenjiang Longmao Rice Store, Song Xijing, the manager of Shanghai Songjingji Rice Store, rice trader Li Sizhong, and Li Yunqing, the owner of the Tongtai Gongji rice mill.</p>
<h3>Newspaper Association Emergency Meeting</h3>
<p>Resolved that Fixed Price May Not be Changed</p>
<p>Direct Subscription Not Subject to Interference</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Report] The Newspaper Delivery Association of this city yesterday sent representatives to the Shen Bao to demand: (1) no longer accept direct subscribers in the future, (2) the wholesale price should be the current wholesale price plus a 30% discount. The newspaper asked the Newspaper Association to discuss this matter. Last night, the Newspaper Association convened an emergency meeting for this purpose. The following resolutions were passed: It is found that the fixed price and wholesale price of each newspaper have been decided by the association and may not be changed arbitrarily. Accepting direct subscribers is the business freedom of each newspaper and an inevitable way for each newspaper to develop, and is not subject to any interference. If newspaper vendors ask the Shen Bao to change the wholesale price and stop sending directly subscribed newspapers and refuse to distribute the newspaper, all member newspapers of the association (except for foreign language newspapers) will suspend publication the next day until the newspaper vendors withdraw all requests in order to maintain common interests. Any violation of this resolution will result in expulsion from the membership. In the future, if newspaper vendors take the same action against other member newspapers of the association, this resolution will also apply, and the members will respond in unison.</p>

<h3>Celebrating the National Army's Victory, Implementing a Ten Thousand Yuan Reward for the Troops, Barbers Strive for Future Generations, Vowing to Fight Against Insults in Films</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday afternoon, the joint negotiation committee of the barber industry regarding the film "Fake Phoenix" hosted reporters from various newspapers on the ninth floor of the Jinmen Hotel. Wang Zhenchuan, chairman of the industry association, and Gao Deyu, executive director of the labor union, reported on the dispute and the nine points where they requested cuts or modifications to the film.</p>
<p>Three Points of View from Director Jiao</p>
<p>Following them, Director Jiao Dingkai of the fellow villagers association expressed his opinions: Briefly stating that today, the barber industry is hosting you reporters, and I, in particular, will explain to everyone the views of our association and its relationship regarding my views on "Fake Phoenix." (1) Films are a tool for social education, capable of being widely shown domestically and internationally, or passed down to future generations, influencing their perspectives. They possess unimaginable potential and effectiveness. If a film casts a stain on a person, profession, or matter, it could provoke the condemnation of the entire nation, contemporary individuals, and foreign audiences. If it were to be passed down to future generations and screened, the magnitude of its impact would be even harder to imagine. (2) The nation is carrying out Mandarin education, and film companies have a duty to promote culture. This film still uses the slang of northern Jiangsu, and while the original intention may be satire, it can only elicit laughter from millions of viewers, which goes against the nation's policy on education. (3) Whether it is unofficial histories, novels, or dramas, they all contain the intent of encouraging good and punishing evil. Therefore, books and dramas that have been passed down through the ages, even those that depict adultery, theft, and evil, ultimately ensure that the wicked cannot escape the law, or are subjected to retribution, justice, public opinion, conscience, and various forms of sanctions, in order to align with the principle of encouragement and punishment. This film only portrays barbers engaging in actions and words that harm public morals, and using their tools to commit suicide, without any effect of encouragement or punishment. It is sufficient to inspire those in the profession to use their tools for self-destruction, no different from instigating suicide, and so on.</p>
<p>Vowing to Fight to the Death to Avoid Future Troubles</p>
<p>Finally, the meeting also distributed a "Statement of Reasons for the Insult to the Barber Industry in the Fake Phoenix Film," believing that it was the last straw, and for the sake of their own survival and that of future generations, all barbers across the country vowed to fight to the death, determined to cut out or modify the insulting points in the film, to avoid endless harm.</p>
<p>Origin of the Phrase "Sweeping Green Marks"</p>
<p>Furthermore, the host of yesterday's meeting made two requests to the reporters, stating: (1) A few newspapers have referred to us as "sweeping green marks." Upon investigation, the origin of "sweeping green marks" is actually an inauspicious term. For example, Ningbo barbers, in their spare time from shaving heads, also engaged in the business of carrying coffins and sedan chairs, so people called them "sweeping green marks." Also, when people in prison have their heads shaved, it is called "sweeping green." (2) It is often seen in newspapers that we are referred to as "barber craftsmen," but in fact, "craftsmen" refers to those who can make finished products from raw materials, which does not apply to the barber industry, so please use the term.</p>
<h3>Two "Playboy Ta歲" Sentenced to Death, Two Criminals, Kitahara and Sakio, Imprisoned for Life, Korean Zhang Xiqiu Sentenced to Ten Years</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Japanese war criminal, Shiba Hiraburo, known as "Playboy Ta歲", was sentenced to death yesterday by the Shanghai Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense. The verdict's main text is as follows: "Shiba Hiraburo is sentenced to death for intending to destroy the Chinese nation and killing people during the war. He is sentenced to death for continuously raping in violation of war regulations. He is sentenced to life imprisonment for torturing non-military personnel. He is sentenced to two years of fixed-term imprisonment for gathering people to gamble with the intention of making profits, and the sentence should be death." Shiba Hiraburo is 47 years old, from Tokushima Prefecture, Japan. During the war, he served as the head of the Hangzhou Special Affairs Agency of the Japanese Army and the head of the Public Security Section of the Ningbo Special Affairs Agency, specializing in intelligence gathering, criminalizing the people, and controlling materials. In addition, he used local hooligans to open gambling dens and gather people to gamble. He also forced and seduced women from good families, with a shocking number being raped by him. The people in the eastern Zhejiang area hated him to the bone.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the military tribunal also sentenced in two other war criminal cases: (1) Kitahara Bungo and Ozaki Toraji, former sergeants of the Shanghai Xinshijie Military Police Unit of the enemy's military police, were each sentenced to indefinite imprisonment for continuously torturing non-military personnel in violation of war regulations during the war. (2) Korean Zhang Xiqiu was previously found not guilty of trafficking opium. After being reported to the Ministry of National Defense, the case was returned for retrial. Yesterday, the trial concluded and the verdict was: Zhang Xiqiu is sentenced to ten years of fixed-term imprisonment for helping to eliminate the Chinese nation and promoting drugs.</p>
<p>Two Other War Criminals to be Sentenced on the 24th</p>
<p>Furthermore, the war criminal Taiwanese Chuan Mitian previously abused our officers and soldiers in prisoner of war camps in Shanghai. Minowa Takeo, the former head of the Qingdao Military Police, arrested civilians and abused them during his tenure. The collegiate panel concluded the trial yesterday, and the sentencing is scheduled for the afternoon of the 24th of this month.</p>
<h3>A Defendant in a Vendetta Case Flees with His Entire Family, Ye Guangde is Suspected of Abetment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In the assassination case of Qiu Lianhuan, an investigator at the Gaoshiman Ballroom, 15 suspects were arrested and are currently being investigated by the District Prosecutor's Office. Subsequently, Qiu's wife, Chen, added Ye Guangde, the owner of a firewood shop, as a defendant, accusing him of being one of the major abettors. After the District Prosecutor's Office issued a summons, Ye fled with his entire family. Yesterday, Qiu Chen and Xu A'ming, Dai A'ru, Gu A'jin, and four others who were in the timber business were summoned. According to Xu and others' testimony, Ye had 1.8 million yuan in the spring, which was used up by Qiu, resulting in resentment. Whether this trivial matter triggered the murder is unknown. According to another defendant, nicknamed Little A'fu, in his previous confession, the day after the Qiu case occurred, Ye went to Fu's house and instructed him to flee, so Ye's suspicion of abetment is already credible. According to Xu Dingkan, the prosecutor handling the case, a public prosecution will be filed in the coming days.</p>

<h3>Opinions of the Examination Yuan: Granting of Doctoral Degrees to be Managed Uniformly by the State</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] The legislative principles of the draft "Organizational Law of the Doctoral Degree Evaluation Committee" and the "Detailed Rules for the Doctoral Degree Examination" were discussed in the seventh State Council meeting and then submitted to the Political Review Committee for review. The draft details that doctoral degrees are divided into six categories: Literature, Science, Law, Engineering, Agriculture, and Medicine, as well as the standards for reviewing applicants. The draft and the opinions of the Examination Yuan are recorded below: "Letter of Opinion from the Examination Yuan": The systems for doctoral degrees vary greatly from country to country, and even within the same country, there are discrepancies. Generally speaking, however, state-granted degrees are of a higher standard than school-granted degrees. The French State Doctorate is one example. Japan initially used unified evaluation and awarding, but later changed to individual universities awarding degrees, which lowered the standard, as is particularly evident. Our country's degrees, according to the current Degree Conferral Law, already adopt a three-tier system of Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctorate. The standard of the highest tier, the Doctorate, should be particularly raised, which goes without saying. However, the graduate schools of universities or independent colleges in our country have not yet been able to establish a balanced system, and due to the impact of the war, it is difficult to improve academic standards quickly. If individual schools and colleges directly evaluate and award degrees, it will be difficult not only to produce doctoral candidates in a short period of time, but also to establish academic standards. In the last two or three decades, it would be better to continue to follow the current law and have the state uniformly evaluate and award degrees. Moreover, in-depth specialized research is not necessarily limited to university graduate schools. Especially in recent years, there are many scholars who have left universities but want to have their research work or papers reviewed or examined by universities, which is not appropriate. Although the so-called "universities or independent colleges specially authorized to accept doctoral candidates" are not limited to accepting professors or alumni from their own schools, academic independence is the case in all countries, and it is difficult to have consistent academic views. If the opinions are not the same, it will be difficult to seek them. Therefore, it is better to have the state manage the evaluation than to have the schools evaluate, as it can eliminate sectarianism and broadly seek talent, which is more effective in achieving results. Based on the above reasons, doctoral degrees should still be awarded by the state through unified examination, as stipulated in the current Degree Conferral Law, and there is no need to change it.</p>
<p>Organizational Law of the Doctoral Degree Evaluation Committee</p>
<p>"Draft of the Organizational Law of the Doctoral Degree Evaluation Committee": (Article 1) This law is formulated in accordance with the provisions of Article 7, Paragraph 2 of the Degree Conferral Law. (Article 2) The Doctoral Degree Evaluation Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Committee) is organized by the Examination Yuan in conjunction with the Executive Yuan and the National Central Research Institute. (Article 3) The responsibilities of the Committee are as follows: (1) Handling matters related to the Doctoral Degree Examination; (2) Requesting the awarding of Doctoral Degrees; (3) Recommending, reviewing, and requesting the awarding of Honorary Doctoral Degrees; (4) Other matters related to the evaluation of Doctoral Degrees. (Article 4) The Committee shall have seven ex officio members, who shall be the President of the Examination Yuan, the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, the Secretary of the Council of the National Central Research Institute, the Minister of Education, the Chairman of the Examination Committee, and two representatives elected by the presidents of the National Universities. The representatives elected by the presidents of the National Universities shall serve a term of three years and may be re-elected. If they are relieved of their duties as presidents during their term, the succeeding president of the university shall serve. (Article 5) The Committee shall have 18 to 34 members, allocated according to disciplines. The Examination Yuan shall consult with the Central Research Institute and the Ministry of Education to select candidates who meet one of the following qualifications and submit them to the National Government for appointment: (1) Those who have served as university professors; (2) Those who have presided over academic research or important construction work for more than five years and have made specialized research and special contributions, and who have an academic reputation; (3) Those who have obtained a doctoral degree in accordance with the Degree Conferral Law.

Director Gu expressed his concern about the difficult living conditions of municipal school teachers, and said: "In this time of financial constraints, when the government cannot improve the lives of teachers, if we can gain the sympathy of people in society and the parents of students, and they are willing to provide teachers with financial assistance to stabilize their lives, then it may be worthwhile to pursue this avenue to obtain a proper and reasonable fee collection method. At the same time, if we can refer to the methods of collecting tuition, meal fees, and teacher appreciation fees in various places, and establish a compromise and feasible method for implementation in this city, and try to increase the number of children enrolled as much as possible, such as those who meet the regulations for public school personnel, martyrs, soldiers, and the poor, and grant them unlimited exemptions, then the lives of teachers will not be difficult to get some help."

<h3>To Solve the Food Problem in North China, Tianjin and Shanghai Exchange Materials</h3>
<p>Zhang Jiaao Reported the Process to Beijing Last Night</p>
<p>Zhang Jiaao, the president of the Central Bank, flew from Shanghai to Pingjin on the 14th of this month to solve the food problem in Qianshi North China, to see the actual situation and discuss regulatory measures with the authorities in North China. Zhang originally planned to go to the Northeast, but was summoned to Beijing and returned here on the 18th. Last night, he took a military trip to Beijing to report everything. According to Zhang (19th) when he met with the reporter of the United Credit Information Agency in the State Bank, he talked about: This trip to North China was to inspect the business of the branch and the food problem. Because North China suffered from the communist bandits looting, the price of food soared, and the people's life was quite difficult. The supply situation should be carefully studied. After researching the results with the various officials in Pingjin, North China needs 800 tons of food every day. In the past, the four lines of PingSui, PingHan, JinPu, and BeiNing were the arteries for food supply. At present, the JinPu, PingHan, and BeiNing lines are interrupted due to the war, and only PingSui can supply, but the quantity is not large, which has led to a serious problem. At that time, it was decided that (1) Shanghai would subsidize North China's food, and (2) North China would supply Shanghai with fuel, support each other, and exchange materials to achieve the goal of stabilizing life and stabilizing prices. Regarding the former, North China hopes to subsidize 200,000 tons, from July to the end of this year, but a part can be purchased locally, and at least 100,000 tons will be transported to support it in the future. Half of this food is ordered from foreign countries, because its price is one-third lower than wheat. It has now started to transport 300,000 bags of flour to public and teaching personnel in Pingjin, and Tianjin also distributed workers and civilians. After the foreign-ordered grains arrive, they will be supplied monthly. Regarding the latter, (1) Kailuan coal is now actively increasing production, and the Beining Road has also begun to rush to transport. There are 75,000 tons of coal transported to Qinhuangdao, and 130,000 tons can be transported to Shanghai by the end of this month. The coal shortage in this city can be solved. In order to encourage it, it was decided to give 80,000 bags of flour to Kailuan miners and 40,000 bags to Beining Road workers (2) This city is short of white coal, and it has been decided to order it from Annam, and Changcheng can also supply a part. This city needs about 6,000 tons of briquettes per month, which is also supplied by North China. Zhang continued to describe the financial situation in North China, saying that the financial industry in North China also feels the difficulty of slow growth in deposits. Due to the lack of computing codes, the banking industry in Pingjin has jointly set up a joint reserve, and at the same time increased rediscounting. The purchasing power of the people in North China has been weakened, and commerce is extremely declining. Zhang finally talked about the financial problems in the Northeast, saying that the Northeast circulating coupons once fell to 8.5 yuan, and now it is 11.5 yuan. Due to the free exchange and trade between inside and outside the customs, the Ministry of Finance is planning to unify the currency system, and the government will announce the way in the future. After the Communist bandits destroyed the Northeast, the losses were extremely huge, and the soybeans and coal that could enter the customs were hopeless. The goods shipped out of the customs were mostly cigarettes and tea.</p>
<h3>Loose Monetary Environment and Active Floating Capital, Brisk Demand for Yarn and Cloth, Bidding Prices in the Market Are All Higher Than the Previous Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions were due to the loose monetary environment, active intentions from all parties, and floating capital participating in commercial market activities, so the prices were often raised. However, most of the actual sales in the market were sporadic, but in the middle, there were some sell-offs at higher prices, and the rise was not as good. As a result, the 42-count Blue Phoenix rose by 300,000 yuan compared to the previous day, to 18 million yuan. The 20-count Extra Double Horse rose by 400,000 yuan, to 12 million yuan.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market conditions were due to the loose monetary environment. At the beginning of the opening, the market was quite enthusiastic, and customers came to purchase when prices were low. In addition, there were extra-industry participants, which made the buying trend even stronger. The holders of goods held on, and the market was very good.

<h3>Major Investors Rush to Sell, Chinese Stocks Plunge Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rally in Chinese stocks could not be sustained. The difference in bank settlements from the previous day was substantial, leading to a lively opening. However, external speculative funds were not attracted. After reaching a high, trading slowed, and then major investors in Sino-Foreign Industries and other companies urgently sought to sell, leading to a complete collapse and a severe decline. Secondary hot stocks like Mei Ya were also affected. Because the economic reform plan will be announced next week, operators are worried that credit may tighten again, leading to a wave of selling. Near noon, pessimism intensified, and the market collapsed. Except for Qin Xing, all stocks closed at lower prices. Trading in miscellaneous stocks was limited, and some remained strong amidst the general weakness.</p>
<p>The market opened high in the morning, and many investors took advantage of the high prices to sell. Delai Furuiya retreated from 605 yuan to 600 yuan, and then was sold down to 597 yuan. Some people took the opportunity to buy at the low price, and Delai Sino-Foreign Industries rose from 3740 yuan to 3920 yuan. Delai Mei Ya also rose to 611 yuan. However, it soon fell below 595 yuan. After that, Sino-Foreign Industries suddenly experienced a sharp decline, changing the overall market situation. After 10:30, the reaction became even worse. Currently, Sino-Foreign Industries is falling more and more severely, with Delai Sino-Foreign Industries dropping to 3300 yuan before slightly rising to close at 3330 yuan. Trading in existing Sino-Foreign Industries is limited, only falling to 3420 yuan. Delai Mei Ya was also affected, falling to 550 yuan, and then closing at 551 yuan. Existing Mei Ya closed at a low price of 540 yuan. After the close, the asking prices for Mei Ya and Sino-Foreign Industries remained stable. Dong Xing and Guohuo, on the other hand, closed at higher prices. As a result, compared to the previous close, among the stocks for immediate delivery, French shares fell slightly, Sino-Foreign Industries, Mei Ya, China Flour, Qin Xing, and Xinhua each fell less than half a percent, as did Yonggong. Xingguang Jingfu fell slightly more than half a percent. Tongyi and Shangwu remained flat. Guohuo rose slightly more than half a percent. Liann Cement and Wuhe Underwear rose slightly.

It is reported that the preparatory committee has tried to retain him.</p>
<h3>Active Cotton Market Trading</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market saw relatively active market conditions because the money market was moving, yarn factories had quite the appetite, and buyers were adding orders. At the same time, the cotton yarn closing trend was quite solid, hence people's hearts are filled with optimism. The market was characterized by strong selling pressure, and trading was more active than the previous day. Prices did not fluctuate significantly, and the basis seemed quite stable. The factory price for each grade was as follows: Ling Sai 2.27 million, Sha Shi 2.10 million to 2.18 million, Han Xi 1.97 million, 2.02 million, 2.12 million. Chong Sha Shi 2.12 million.

<h3>Dyeing, Weaving, and Five Other Guilds Request Rescission of Gas Restrictions</h3>
<p>And Immediate Reduction of Additional Fine Burden</p>
<p>The dyeing, weaving, thermos bottle, type casting, light bulb, and electrical equipment industries and other guilds in this city, are suffering intolerably from the gas company's restrictions on industrial gas usage and the harsh fines. They have decided to jointly send representatives to petition the Public Utilities Bureau on the 21st (next Monday). They have listed reasons for requesting the cancellation of the restrictions to maintain industry. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Gas is an essential fuel for industry. Starting in July, the price per 100 cubic feet increased from 1,200 yuan to 3,600 yuan. Compared to other public utilities such as electricity and water, the increase rate is uniquely high, and it has lost the level of reason. The most unreasonable aspect is that the usage limit is too low. Exceeding the limit incurs a fine of five times the price of 3,600 yuan per 100 cubic feet, making it unbearable for factories. The origin of this restriction dates back to the period of occupation. At that time, under the control of the enemy and puppets, the Shanghai Water and Fire Company severely suppressed the usage limit for civilian industries in order to supply large amounts of gas for military needs. Each factory was limited to a minimum of several tens of degrees and a maximum of only several hundreds of degrees. Because industries were confined to a corner, and their products could not be sold far, most of the original equipment was shut down, the company used this as a calculation standard. After the victory, industries recovered, and equipment gradually expanded, and the usage increased day by day. The company not only did not consider relaxing the restrictions, but still followed the past restrictive measures. Knowing that the usage within this limit is not enough for industry, instead of considering increasing the supply quantity, it enacted a huge fine for exceeding the limit. This is tantamount to a disguised price increase, and it is a bad precedent that has never existed in any public utility. After the price increase in July, the limit was not relaxed, and the fine increased sharply from 300% to 400%. Currently, the monthly usage of each factory is only between several tens of degrees, and the burden of additional fines totals more than 10 million per month. Such measures are destroying industry. Because the member factories of each guild have repeatedly requested correction, please quickly order the British-owned Water and Fire Company to immediately rescind the fine measures.</p>
<h3>Chen Qimen Sells Well, 400+ Cases Traded</h3>
<p>Since tea merchants believed that inventory on the market was limited for various export green teas, such as Special Grade, Zhenmei, and other varieties, sales intention turned firm. At the moment, despite seekers still clustering, it is still hard to get what one desires, the transactions still weak, but the process is stable as before. Among other types, the most active transactions were for old-fashioned black tea of lower grade. As for domestic sales, the weather had just turned clear for vendors around the country, so demand was not strong. For local stores in this city, replenishment is still happening in a steady stream, especially of old second-grade Qimen, for which a large number of trades was made, reaching 436 cases. The price has remained consistently solid. It is reported that the this year's new Qimen black tea that arrived in Shanghai several days ago, are seeing very active negotiations, however, the distance between both party's asking price is considerable, and transactions are temporarily difficult to carry out.</p>
<h3>Purchasing Old Tea is Not Compulsory</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to the Central Trust Bureau: Tea purchases are divided into two types: loans and non-loans. For the loan portion, the Four Banks Joint Office has entrusted the bureau to purchase the old tea from the 35th year, and the purchase price will be determined by the Central Bank. The bureau's handling of the purchase is not compulsory in nature. Therefore, the rumors that tea merchants are selling old tea to foreign firms are also welcome to do so. The bureau will still begin accepting applications from tea merchants for purchase starting on the 25th, it said.</p>

<h3>Soap Prices Rise Across the Board</h3>

Coupled with the easing of credit, speculative funds turned to goods, and prices were often bid up. As a result, Gubenz Soap rose to 500,000 yuan, an increase of 5,000 yuan, continuing the increase of 9,000 yuan from the previous day. Arrow Dao Soap rose sharply by 15,000 yuan to 495,000 yuan.

<h3>Textile Adjustment Changes Method for Applying for Allocations of Imported Cotton</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to the regulations for allocating imported cotton, yarn factories applying for allocations of imported cotton must have more than 3,000 spindles. The Textile Adjustment Committee has repeatedly received letters from small yarn factories requesting the same rights. After deliberation, the Textile Adjustment Committee has decided that yarn factories with fewer than 3,000 spindles but with equipment capable of producing cotton yarn of 20 counts or higher and product quality rated at grade D or higher will also be entitled to apply for allocations starting from the third quarter quota. The Textile Adjustment Committee has sent the new regulations to the Cotton Spinning Guild in the Sixth District for its members to review.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] According to the Central Trust Bureau: It has been agreed that imported cotton that arrived in port before the end of April this year but could not obtain permits will be purchased by the Central Trust Bureau. The total value of this batch of imported cotton is approximately US$8 million, most of which belongs to various yarn factories. In principle, the bureau hopes that both national and private yarn factories can spin the cotton on consignment. If private yarn factories are unwilling to spin the cotton on consignment, the bureau requires that the applying factories spin at least half of the cotton yarn on consignment for the bureau, and the remaining half will still be entrusted to the Textile Building Company.</p>

<h3>Planting Wheat and Seizing Wheat: Two or Three Things in the Shandong "Liberated Area"</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Li Tian</p>
<p>Jinan, 14th (Air Dispatch)</p>
<p>In Shandong, except for the areas along the front lines and the newly recovered areas, where farmers fled and failed to sow in time, resulting in wasteland, or even if sown, the wheat seedlings were uprooted by the Communist army before their retreat, the spring harvest this year can be considered a bumper one in the Shandong "Liberated Area." Especially in Zibo, Jiaodong, northern Shandong, and the Yishan mountainous area, according to refugees who have escaped: "The wheat ears hang low, almost falling, with as many as forty grains per ear. Looking south, it is a golden sea, quite beautiful!" The farmers, who have worked hard for years with "food as the priority," are congratulating each other, believing that they will no longer starve this year! Who knew, out of the blue, the "Shandong Provincial Chairman" of the Communist Party, Li Yu, and the "Commander of the East China People's Liberation Army," Chen Yi, jointly ordered ten columns and local units, totaling about 100,000 people, to be divided and deployed to various places to assist the people in harvesting the new wheat, except for the necessary guard troops left on the front line. Chen Yi's official newspaper, "Dazhong Daily," also vigorously promoted the all-out wheat-seizing movement with large headlines every day, calling for and launching a full-scale wheat-seizing movement: seizing the harvest, seizing the threshing, seizing the transportation, seizing the storage.</p>
<p>"Three Months of Grain"</p>
<p>As expected, starting in early June, within half a month, the wheat was all harvested and threshed. But what was the result? The second order that followed was to distribute the wheat to each household according to population, 40 catties per person per month, half for small mouths, and distribute for three months. The rest was to be stored uniformly by the "Liberated Area Government." As for the past practices, with numerous names but little effect, such as "comfort grain offering," "expansion grain offering," "support for the families of resistance fighters," and "struggle fine grain," etc., were simply abandoned. The wheat issued to the people for only three months of consumption could be kept and stored by themselves. If the area was occupied by the National Army, and the wheat was discovered or lost due to the war, the "Liberated Area Government" would no longer be responsible. Therefore, the food that the people in the "Liberated Area" could control and had the right to handle was only for three months. What would happen after three months? The "Liberated Area Government" controlled all the food of the people, which was no different from controlling the lives of all the people.</p>
<p>The Preserve-Your-Rice-Bowl Movement</p>
<p>Wherever the Communist army arrived, the first "benevolent policy" was to liquidate, struggle, and "the poor people turn over," followed by the equal distribution of land, cattle, and houses seized through struggle. The main purpose of the Communist army was not to love the people, but to coerce them into "joining the army" under the guise of the "Preserve-Your-Rice-Bowl Movement" or the "Protect-Your-Land Movement." Under the Communist army's clever propaganda, people could not protect their distributed property if they did not join the army. Therefore, according to the still incomplete Xinhua News Agency broadcasts for May and June regarding joining the army, in the Jilu Yu Military Region of the Shandong Military Region alone, 11 counties saw 50,000 people joining the army after the "land distribution." After screening, 37,000 people were sent to the front lines, 80% of whom were poor peasants. Zhang Changqi's two sons, two grandsons, and two nephews, six people in all, were conscripted. Seven newly married grooms in Weihai Village, Yanggu County, also "voluntarily" joined the army. In Shouzhang County, 3,500 young men joined the army in three months, 4,000 in Qihe, 1,500 each in Changyi and Chengwucounty, and 5,000 in Liaocheng. The above roughly totals 52,500 people, but how can this number be matched by the conscription figures of any province in the rear?</p>
<p>Forced Conscription</p>
<p>The Communist army's source of soldiers was completed under the manufacture and propaganda of this "Preserve-Your-Rice-Bowl Movement." If propaganda was insufficient, it was followed by enticements (such as using young girls to carry sedan chairs, perform Yangko dances, put on plays, hold farewell rallies, and reduce taxes and levies for those who joined the army, etc.). If enticements were insufficient, they were followed by coercion (such as using criticism, threats, and increasing burdens to force those who were unwilling to join the army to do so). When coercion was insufficient, they resorted to forced conscription, using their tight local organizations to order local administrative organs (such as counties, districts, and villages) to form conscription committees.</p>
<p>The Organization and Replenishment of Militias</p>
<p>After the people were forced to join the army, the first step for most was to become village militiamen (according to statistics, there are currently over 1.13 million village militiamen in Shandong). In principle, they do not leave their hometowns, so people are more easily fooled and willing to enlist. After serving as militiamen for a short period of time, they are reorganized into district squadrons and other units as needed. Their organization and replenishment process is as follows: Village Militia → District Squadron → County Independent Battalion → Joint Defense Brigade → Art and Cadre Unit → Local Corps → Field Army</p>
<p>Each soldier receives better treatment and equipment as they are transferred upwards from the village militia, and they become more respected and "honored" in the Liberated Area. Therefore, a small number of people unknowingly become more willing to be promoted. Not only that, in order to encourage people to fight bravely and willingly after joining the army, the Communist army, in addition to general comfort, especially elevated and respected the status of soldiers in the army. Soldiers sat in the front row when watching plays, and officers sat in the back row. Soldiers sat in the upper seats during banquets, eating dumplings and steamed buns with better vegetables, while officers sat in the lower seats, eating cornbread and millet noodles with poor vegetables. Especially before each combat mission, they would definitely hold large banquets, eating and drinking lavishly for six or seven days. According to common sense, the soldiers should have no more problems and be willing to die!</p>
<p>Sending to Die and Escaping to Live</p>
<p>But the reality is not so simple. When soldiers hear that there is a big feast, most of them invariably believe that their death is not far away! So, the passive ones intentionally harm parts of their bodies to become disabled, or feign illness, or even commit suicide. The active ones take the risk of running away towards government-controlled areas. In order to stop this phenomenon of desertion, the Communist army then promulgated the most terrifying and cruel laws: "Deserters will be killed!" "Deserters will implicate their entire families!" The masses have no other way but to be forced to "martyr" themselves for the "Chinese Communist Party" and "send themselves to death." Many refugees who managed to escape from the "Liberated Area" all said in unison: "In the 'Liberated Area,' we, the common people, have never seen a smiling face. Even if there is one, it only belongs to the Communist ruling class, but it is definitely not the common people!"</p>

<h3>Prelude to Total Mobilization in Cultural Circles of the Capital</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Ding Kuanghua</p>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Express Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhang Daofan said: "The current struggle is not a struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party; it is the suppression by the entire populace of the nation of traitors who sell out the interests of the nation. It is not a fight for private party interests, but for the survival of the nation and its people." Ren Zhuoxuan said: "We must face the truth and from now on everyone should refer to the Communist bandits as 'Red Traitors' and 'Fifth Columnists'."</p>
<p>Since the issuance of the General Mobilization Order, everything in the capital city has been showing a "dynamic" atmosphere. The political circles have been mobilized, the military circles have been mobilized, the industrial and commercial circles have been mobilized, the women's circles have been mobilized, and yesterday, the cultural circles were also mobilized!</p>
<p>Yesterday at 8 PM, the Central Cultural Movement Committee in Xiangpu Camp was filled with cultural figures from various cultural organizations in the capital, eagerly discussing the total cultural mobilization with their mouths and pens.</p>
<p>The meeting first took place on the upper floor of the Public Recreation Association. Before the meeting, the cultural figures cordially chatted about their respective careers and plans. Only one young master, probably a representative of the Buddhist Association, sat in a corner, waving a paper fan, silent, his mind wandering between worldly involvement and detachment. In fact, during the Anti-Japanese War, monks could even form big knife teams, so today they should also be able to contribute something.</p>
<p>At precisely 8 o'clock, the meeting began. Mr. Zhang Daofan entered the meeting as the host and leader of the cultural movement, and nominated the supervisory committee member</p>
<p>Liu Shidu</p>
<p>Mr. Liu took the chair. Mr. Liu, with his neatly trimmed mustache, smiled as he assumed the chairmanship. Now that the situation is clarified and peace talks have become a thing of the past, Mr. Liu earnestly repeated in his opening remarks: "From now on, we must severely suppress and punish traitors who violate government decrees and national interests. Colleagues in the cultural world should especially strengthen publicity at home and abroad regarding the exposure of the bandit army's atrocities, diligently explore theories of national salvation, and work diligently." His peaceful Sichuan accent was full of passionate sentiments. Next, Mr. Zhang Daofan stood up to give a speech.</p>
<p>Zhang Daofan</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang is an experienced speaker, and he spoke quite fluently. He first made a clear account of the Communist bandits' history of harming the country, and then concluded: "We must recognize that the current struggle is not a struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but the suppression by the entire populace of the nation of traitors who sell out the interests of the nation. It is not a fight for private party interests, but for the survival of the nation and its people." Mr. Zhang's perfect Beijing accent and dramatic gestures couldn't help but remind me of his speaking scene in the film "Secret Code". His sharp tongue has been mobilizing along with the history of the revolution. At this moment, the hearts of the cultural figures should have been shaken by his righteous words, and applause resounded throughout the venue.</p>
<p>In the bright and cheerful breeze of tomorrow, veteran journalist</p>
<p>Xu Junwu</p>
<p>Mr. Xu opened the conversation, requesting that the internal steps of the cultural circles should be consistent, and that each can use their strengths formally. He does not advocate the kind of anti-Japanese stereotyped writing that begins with "Since the July 7th Incident," as that kind of formal unity is precisely the fatal flaw of the cultural circles in the past. He spoke excitedly, and the pair of eyes under the shadows of his prominent forehead emitted a sincere light. (Note: Mr. Xu is currently the editor of the Huaxia supplement.)</p>
<p>Ren Zhuoxuan</p>
<p>Mr. Ren was "moved." He sat modestly to the side and was not seen by the reporter. He said: "In the past, it was an era of peace talks, but now it is an era of suppressing bandits. How to awaken the people of the country for ideological and spiritual mobilization is the responsibility of colleagues in the cultural world." Mr. Ren's speech was very clear, sharp, courageous, and insightful, making him a first-class theorist. The eyes of the entire audience were focused on his gray cloth gown and thin face.</p>
<p>Chen Jianfu</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Jianfu of the Zhi Xing Society, Mr. Chu Boen of the military officer training corps, and Mr. Wang Buyi, editor of Beijige, then spoke in turn. Mr. Wang's words were quite humorous. He believes that there are too many American thighs in the film industry, the broadcasts are full of decadent music, and the drama is also too aristocratic and cannot reach the common people. He further pointed out that the victory of the Anti-Japanese War was due to "chopping off the heads of the Japanese devils with big knives," but now people are confused by "I don't want you, I don't want you, you are a useless thing." Zhang Daofan made a reply to this, expressing that efforts should be made to improve in all aspects.</p>
<p>At this time, Mr. Xu Junwu and Mr. Chen Jianfu jointly put forward a proposal, advocating the establishment of a Capital Cultural General Mobilization Committee to regularly launch cultural mobilization work. The proper naming has caused a lot of opinions. Mr. Ren Zhuoxuan advocated that it be named "Capital Pacification and National Salvation Cultural Mobilization Committee", Mr. Zhong Rongcang advocated that it be named "Anti-Communist and National Salvation Cultural Mobilization Committee", and another advocated that it be named "Capital Cultural Anti-Bandit Mobilization Committee". When everyone stated their opinions, they were very enthusiastic. As a result, Zhang Daofan came out to smooth things over, and nominated Ren Zhuoxuan, Hu Yishang, Xu Junwu, Chu Boen, and Chen Jianfu as the five members of the preparatory committee to discuss the cultural mobilization organization and the progress of the work.</p>
<p>The chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting, it was already 10:55 PM.</p>
<p>Hu Yiguan</p>
<p>Mr. Hu then greeted the other four members of the preparatory committee in the capacity of convener, preparing to continue the discussion overnight. His enthusiasm is admirable.</p>
<p>The fire of suppressing chaos and saving the country has been ignited in the cultural circles, setting off a wave of national self-salvation. When the first ray of dawn shines on this ancient and troubled land tomorrow, this call will surely resound far and wide, and countless mouths and countless pens will be firmly armed to participate in the revolutionary camp against rebellion and aggression.</p>
<h3>New Scenery of Xiamen University</h3>
<p>— Ai Te</p>
<p>Xiamen, 8th (Air Dispatch)</p>
<p>Since the victory, the whole country has unanimously demanded educational construction. However, due to the various damages caused by internal strife, the effects we expected have been shattered, leaving the national education still in a precarious situation. However, Xiamen University has assumed the mission of this era and is marching towards the avenue of educational construction!</p>
<p>Xiamen University was founded in the tenth year of the Republic of China by the overseas Chinese magnate Chen Jiageng. Mr. Chen ran Xiamen University with his own funds for sixteen years. Later, due to his personal business failure, the government changed it to a national university, and Zang Bendong served as the first president of National Xiamen University. Not long after Mr. Sa took over, the Anti-Japanese War broke out, and Xiamen fell into enemy hands. The campus was moved to Changting. During the eight years, due to Mr. Sa's painstaking planning and the joint efforts of the teachers and students of the entire school, the school's reputation continued to rise. It earned the honor of being "the first university east of Calcutta." After the victory, Xiamen University moved back to Xiamen from Changting. Under the leadership of the current president, Dr. Wang Deyi, it not only maintains the excellent traditions of Xiamen University in the past, but also adds a new joy of rebirth.</p>
<p>Most of the original school buildings were destroyed by the enemy. After the restoration, the school did its best to repair them, and now they have been roughly restored. The school buildings are tall and majestic, with mountains behind and the sea in front. Coupled with the pleasant climate of the southern country, people are often recuperating in the shade of green trees, which can be said to be full of poetic flavor.</p>
<p>Xiamen University has four colleges: Liberal Arts, Law, Science and Engineering, and Business. It is divided into Chinese, Foreign Languages, History, Education, Economics, Politics, Law (with Judicial Group), Mathematics and Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Civil Engineering, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Aviation, Banking, Accounting, and other departments. In addition to the Department of Marine Biology, which was ordered to be established last year, and the Department of International Trade, which was newly established this fall, there are a total of four colleges and seventeen departments. In addition, the establishment of the Science and Engineering Branch, the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Branch, and the Physical Education Department, it is said that it may be gradually realized in the near future.</p>
<p>In terms of equipment, the impact suffered during the Anti-Japanese War was minimal, so the preservation of books and instruments was possible. The recent large-scale purchase of books for the Liberal Arts and Law Colleges, as well as the completion of the Engineering Building, all demonstrate that Xiamen University is in a courageous leap forward.</p>
<p>In terms of faculty, Wang Yanan, Guo Dali, Guo Yicen... have recently been hired, all of whom are scholars of great renown at home and abroad. The establishment of various research laboratories also shows that the diligent academic style of Xiamen University is being increasingly promoted.</p>
<p>Mr. Kirk, the American Deputy Consul in Shanghai, once visited the school and hoped that American universities could exchange students with Xiamen University. Then we saw reports that the Philippine government would send four students to come. These all show that Dongda is not only the highest national</p>
<p>Xiamen University's enrollment work for this year has been launched in succession. The examination areas are determined to be divided into five areas: Xiamen, Fuzhou, Shanghai, Nanchang, and Shantou. The number of admissions is temporarily set at 570.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of democracy opened earlier, and Xiamen University has become particularly progressive in recent years. President Wang is leading by example and aspires to build a most ideal and most democratic Xiamen University. We also hope that his wish will be achieved and create a good model for the educational construction of the new China!</p>
<h3>Heavy Rain and Flooding of the Jinjiang River: Severe Flood in Chengdu, the First Tragic Scene in Sixty Years</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Zhou Xueduan</p>
<p>Chengdu, 10th (Air Dispatch)</p>
<p>This year is an unfortunate year for Sichuan. In the Land of Abundance, Chengdu, which has always been known for its stability, the man-made rice chaos has just subsided, and the rice shortage problem has not yet been resolved. This month, it suffered an unprecedented flood. More than 100,000 people were affected, and public and private property worth 60 billion yuan was lost. Due to the frequent disasters and misfortunes of the past month, the secluded and peaceful society of Chengdu has turned into a tragic picture of refugees everywhere.</p>
<p>The Chengdu Plain is the richest area in the country because the upper reaches of the Minjiang River have the world-famous Dujiangyan irrigation project, forming the "Land of Abundance where people have no hunger and do not know drought and waterlogging." The quiet Jinjiang River surrounds the Jinjiang City, winding around it like a belt. It is usually only for sightseeing. For hundreds of years, there has been no fear of disaster, which has cultivated the impression and experience of Chengdu people without any flood control. In the past month, there has been incessant rain in western Sichuan, and mountain torrents have erupted. The upper reaches of the Min, Tuo, and Fu rivers have also collapsed. The Feisha Weir and the herringbone dike of the Dujiangyan have been washed away, and the water level of the Neijiang River has surged. Starting from 0:00 on the 4th, Chengdu was suddenly hit by torrential rain, and the world was dark. It lasted for a day and night, and the water depth on the plain was three feet. The Jinjiang River overflowed, and the raging waves poured back into the urban area. In the low-lying areas, the water reached the roof pipes. The city was full of floods, a vast expanse of water. Houses, people, animals, and materials along the river were scattered by the huge waves and flowed with the waves, and the screams shook the sky. The Anshun Bridge, built a hundred years ago, and the Wanfu Bridge, built more than sixty years ago, were both submerged and washed away by the flood. More than sixty other bridges of all sizes were washed away. More than a thousand residents along the river who were unable to escape were washed away by the flood, and all their property was swept away, creating the first great flood in sixty years.</p>
<p>100,000 Victims amidst a Pile of Rubble</p>
<p>The heavy rain stopped on the 5th, but the urban area was still a vast expanse of water. The reporter waded through the water to climb the city tower to have a bird's-eye view of the disaster. All around was a vast expanse of water, with raging waves. The houses, furniture, sundries, corpses, livestock, and goods stored in the warehouses along the river were washed away, rolling and flowing with the waves. The victims helped the old and carried the young, hurrying to climb to high places to avoid the water, portraying the horror of the flood. On the 7th, the flood gradually receded, and the reporter went to the disaster area again to investigate. The once prosperous entertainment area was now just barren smoke and weeds, a pile of rubble. The bustling Anshun and Wanfu Bridges and hundreds of households were swept away by the flood. There were almost no survivors in the houses along the river. The victims, who had lost their homes and property, cried out to the heavens, weeping bitterly, which was truly tragic. According to the survey by the municipal government, more than 30,000 households were affected by the disaster, more than 100,000 people were affected, and the loss of public and private property exceeded 60 billion yuan. This is an unprecedented catastrophe that Chengdu has never suffered in nearly a hundred years.</p>
<p>Collapse of Dujiangyan and Unseasonable Rainfall</p>
<p>Chengdu - a land of peace and happiness on the plain, does not have high mountains and large rivers. Why did it suddenly suffer an unprecedented flood? According to the survey by the Water Conservancy Bureau, the reasons for this catastrophic phenomenon are: First, there has been continuous rain in western Sichuan recently, and mountain torrents have erupted. The flood control projects such as the Feisha Weir and the herringbone dike of the Dujiangyan have been washed down by the floods, and the water level of the Neijiang River has reached its highest point of 23 huas (usually around 7 or 8 huas). The water势 in the western Sichuan basin is vast, and the situation is precarious. Second, there was heavy rain in various places on the 4th, and the rainfall near Chengdu exceeded 300 mm, exceeding the total rainfall of the same month in previous years. The Fu River could not hold it, so it overflowed and flowed horizontally. At the same time, the floods in the upper reaches of the Dujiangyan suddenly arrived, and the two converged into a disaster. At the same time, not only Chengdu, but also more than ten counties near Rong were all flooded, such as Jin, Peng, Chong, Xin, Guan, Wen, and Pi, known as the 16 counties of Chengdu, all suffered unprecedented disasters. The Chengdu-Chongqing, Chengdu-Guanxian, Sichuan-Shaanxi, and Sichuan-Kang highways were submerged, the highways were washed away, the bridges collapsed, transportation was interrupted, and the property losses of the people were countless. According to the elders, the Neijiang River basin has suffered such a huge disaster, which is the only one in a hundred years.</p>
<p>Starving Victims Awaiting Relief</p>
<p>After the disaster, 100,000 victims were displaced, the scene was tragic, and they were waiting for relief. The provincial and municipal governments united with various agencies to establish a "Joint Emergency Relief Committee". Governor Deng Xihou of the provincial government, Speaker Xiang Chuanyi of the Provincial Council, and Huang Jilu, chairman of the Party Headquarters, went to inspect the disaster situation and console the victims. They also telegraphed Chairman Jiang of the National Government and President Zhang of the Executive Yuan, reporting the disaster situation, and the Central Government allocated 10 billion yuan for emergency relief. In addition to Mr. Deng's personal donation of 18 million yuan for disaster relief, he also launched public and private institutions, industrial and commercial firms, and wealthy households throughout the city to donate generously. However, the most enthusiastic performance was the Chengdu press, which has been the most difficult to work with in peacetime and has been waiting for the rice shortage. The Xin Xin News here first donated one day's salary of 1 million yuan for disaster relief after the flood, and then raised tens of millions of yuan for donations. Central News Agency, Industrial and Commercial Herald, Zhongxing Daily and others responded successively. On the 9th, the Chengdu press specially organized an "Expanded Joint Fundraising Disaster Relief Conference" to launch a city-wide movement to jointly donate one day's income, requesting assistance from colleagues and fellow villagers in Shanghai, Beijing, and Chongqing, and held recreational fundraising activities. With the enthusiasm of the press colleagues, it is predicted that the results will be satisfactory.</p>
<p>Soon, the donation movement from all walks of life was launched enthusiastically. The provincial government has allocated 1 billion yuan for relief, and the Central Government has also decided to remit funds for emergency relief. The Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang and the Shanghai Sichuan-Kang Fellow Association have sent telegrams of condolences, which is the highest expression of human sympathy. It is said that "sympathy is a symbol of human civilization." The victims here earnestly hope that the Sichuan compatriots in Beijing and Shanghai will provide practical assistance beyond sympathy.</p>
<h3>Ripples in Paradise: Interesting Issues in the Hangzhou City Council - Social Dancing and Wonton Vendors</h3>
<p>— By our Special Correspondent, Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>Hangzhou, 18th (Quick Dispatch)</p>
<p>Even the serene Hangzhou, the "Paradise," occasionally experiences slight ripples. The City Council often serves as the mainstream within these circles of water ripples. These ripples are mostly extraordinarily interesting, making people ponder them and ultimately elicit a faint smile.</p>
<p>On July 11th of the 36th year of the Republic (1947), the first Hangzhou City Council held its fifth general meeting, raising two extremely interesting issues: the opening of dance restrictions and the ban on wonton vendors. These two issues troubled the City Councilors with tense and heated debates, and also stirred up the entire city of Hangzhou.</p>
<p>The matter is as follows: Since dancing in Hangzhou was prohibited due to pressure in June of the 35th year (1946), many dancers have lingered on the shores of West Lake, hoping that it would soon be reopened. Therefore, many dance halls have petitioned the city government, requesting to continue</p>
<p>maintaining dancing businesses.</p>
<p>The city government, naturally in favor for the sake of boosting the city's economy and increasing tax revenue, yet newspapers continued to criticize, and the City Council insisted on not allowing it. Consequently, the Sino-American Dance Hall in the Lakeside West Lake Hotel, built with huge investments and elaborate dance floors, had to switch to operating singing cafes and other businesses. Since then, coffee shops would seize every opportunity to request the opening of the dance ban. The city government, in consideration of the merchants' difficulties, would open the dance ban for three days during each festival, such as the New Year in the Gregorian calendar last year, and then again for three days during the Lunar New Year. However, after these three days, the coffee shops dragged on, hoping to create a fait accompli. After extending for more than half a month, many newspapers severely criticized them again, and the City Council reconvened. Female councilors strongly opposed dancing, and Speaker Zhang Heng also strongly opposed dancing. Therefore, the city government issued a ban again, and the coffee shop association gathered all its employees to petition the City Council. The next day, the Southeast Daily reported that the dancers wanted to pluck Speaker Zhang's beard and dance nude at the City Council. The day after that, the Southeast Daily reported that Speaker Zhang Heng made a big speech, saying that even if the dancers plucked his beard, he would "remain unyielding." Councilors gathered at the City Council, deeply fearing that the dancers would really dance nude at the City Council. Therefore, each coffee shop put up</p>
<p>big slogans and advertisements</p>
<p>, severely scolding the City Council for inexplicably banning dancing. The Sino-American Coffee Shop even offered free tea to customers, calling for the opening of the dance ban. During this period, the coffee shop association entertained reporters several times, once even saying, "The city government has agreed to open it, and the City Council has nothing to say, as long as the reporters don't speak out." Among the reporters in the city, there were also two different opinions, one in favor of opening the dance ban and the other against it, which almost led to a stalemate at the entertainment meeting.</p>
<p>This spring, Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo initiated fundraising for student loans for impoverished students. The fundraising committee decided to use the opening of the dance ban as one of the fundraising methods. So, they sent an official letter to the city government. When the City Council found out, female councilor Chu Chou-kang strongly opposed it, and the Speaker, of course, did not want to be outdone and also strongly opposed it. This continued until before this City Council meeting. The city government submitted a discussion case to the general meeting, titled "Draft Temporary Measures for Restricting Social Dancing in Entertainment Venues in Hangzhou City as Ordered, Requesting Approval." At the same time, at the anniversary celebration dinner of the City Police Bureau, Qian Jingxi, the acting secretary-general of the City Party Headquarters, took the stage to give a speech, advocating the benefits of opening dancing, saying, "As long as it is managed properly, it can not only maintain good social customs but also boost the city's economy and increase tax revenue. Otherwise, secret dance halls will still operate underground, which is also undesirable." City Council Speaker Zhang Heng talked about his past</p>
<p>"beard-plucking" story,</p>
<p>briefly saying: "The Council previously advocated banning dancing, which led the dancers to want to pluck my beard. At the reporters' social gathering earlier this month, there were many singers. Director Ruan gave the lady two lines of poetry: 'Please look at the guests at the table, all of them have long beards to be plucked.' I also replied to Director Ruan with two lines: 'If I had known what would happen today, I would have regretted not listening to your advice.' Because Director Ruan had strongly advised me not to grow a beard back then." He also said that he had hired a Western female teacher to teach dancing in the past and had mastered the steps, and had not forgotten them completely. The next day, newspapers published an article by Zhan Xiaocen, a member of the Legislative Yuan and advisor to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Council, in a prominent position, titled "Why Ban Dancing?" He meant that dancing occupies an important position in human art history. Europe has practiced social dancing for thousands of years without decline because it can promote harmony between the sexes and change social customs. He also said that guests who come to Hangzhou, besides enjoying the scenery, feel lonely. He advocated setting up open-air dance floors in Pinghu Qiuyue, Santanyinyue, Sixth Park, Jiangzhuang, and the public sports field in the summer. After this article was published, the City Council review committee reserved the temporary measures for restricting social dancing submitted by the city government for discussion. Speaker</p>
<p>Zhang Heng stroked his long beard</p>
<p>and said, "I am not afraid of beard-plucking. If, when discussing this proposal, the votes are tied, I will cast the opposing vote." This statement can be said to be an implication from the Speaker. Then, articles were published in the newspapers. One was written by Han Chi-jun, titled "Does Our Country Need Dancing?", mainly arguing that Chinese society cannot accept it at present. The other was written by Wang Xipeng, titled "Who Enjoys Dancing?", arguing that those who enjoy dancing are not the majority of the public, but a small minority. On the 17th, the day of the discussion of the "Measures for Restricting Social Dancing" submitted by the city government, a big debate was triggered. Xu Xiongfei, the chief secretary of the city government, first explained, "After this proposal was submitted, public opinion has reacted with both approval and opposition. In recent years, guests who have come to Hangzhou for sightseeing have often complained that Hangzhou lacks dance halls, which is regrettable. The city government, for the sake of compromise, has cancelled the dance girl system and will open dancing under strict control, which should not cause any abuses. As for the General Mobilization Law, although it is implemented, the United States did not stop dancing during wartime when soldiers were resisting the enemy. By analogy, it is not impossible." Councilors were divided into two factions. One faction, the opposition, said, "May I ask the government, what is the purpose of opening dancing? If it is for financial reasons, it seems that gambling and prostitution can also be opened together. If it is to embellish paradise, then there are many things that should be built, such as environmental hygiene. Also, the target of opening dancing is the wealthy, which may lead to a scene of bright lights and wine in the venue, while beggars are lying outside. The result of opening dancing may lead to problems such as fighting, moral corruption, and corruption." The other faction, the supporters, said, "If dancing is considered to be harmful to social customs, then men and women walking side by side and sitting side by side on rickshaws, sidewalks, and in movie theaters should also be banned. The fact that cities do not allow dancing is something that surprises Westerners."</p>
<p>The two factions were at loggerheads.</p>
<p>The meeting was reconvened in the afternoon for discussion. Many councilors present believed that this was an unprecedentedly tense and heated debate. Just before the discussion of this proposal in the afternoon, Mayor Zhou Xiangxian stood up and explained, "Social dancing is a noble art and social behavior, and the Air Force Academy is also conducting it. Since your council is discussing it like this, I will withdraw this proposal." After the withdrawal, no one in the City Council brought it up for discussion again, and the matter was no longer discussed. The mayor also left the meeting in a hurry. As for whether dancing will be opened in Hangzhou or not, it is still an open question today. I think a problem, especially an entertainment problem, should not be taken too seriously. If it is taken too seriously, it is often difficult to handle. China's social behavior has always been different from that of Europe and the West. If we want to open up to the extent of Europe and the West all at once, there will be many obstacles. But the times are progressing, and we cannot afford to hesitate and wait, or even fail to progress! Another interesting thing is the</p>
<p>attempt to ban wonton vendors.</p>
<p>One councilor, when questioning the head of the city authorities, said, "The clatter of wonton vendors at night disturbs people's sleep and should be stopped." The police chief said that he would do so. Therefore, many wonton vendors on the streets at night were arrested and taken to the authorities. The wonton vendors collectively petitioned the City Council. At the same time, the owner of a wonton stall, Li Datian, wrote a letter to Councilor Zhou Shiruo, who proposed banning the clatter of wonton vendors, saying: "Dear Councilor Zhou Shiruo: When we heard that Mr. Zhou prohibited us from</p>
<p>clattering at night,</p>
<p>we were very alarmed because not being able to clatter at night is tantamount to prohibiting our business and cutting off our livelihood. Who will our families rely on? We are really surprised that rice has become so expensive and prices have risen so high. Why don't you think about us and try to lower them? Instead, you are troubling us wonton vendors. According to Zhou Guangsheng, the clattering at night disturbs people's sleep, but we find it very strange. Sometimes when we carry our stalls to XX Road, in front of a large gate, we only need to clatter twice, and the large gate will open, and a maid will come out to buy wontons. The sound of mahjong tiles can still be heard from inside the room, the clattering sound that disturbs people's sleep. According to the maid, this place is the mansion of Councilor X. Sometimes we see a lady sitting in her own car with a loud bell, disturbing people's sleep, in front of the mansion on XX Road. According to the driver, this is the wife of Councilor X. Mr. Zhou, think about it! Isn't this unreasonable? Which one disturbs people's sleep? We are doing it for a living, what are they doing it for? Please, Mr. Bureau Chief, save the common people and withdraw the order. We will be twelve million times grateful."</p>
<p>The councilors also discussed this case on the 17th. Councilor Zhou said that he had been considering this case for a year before finally raising it today. Another councilor said that if the clattering is not loud, business will not come. He believes that the clattering at night is quite poetic and should be allowed. As a result, the fire committee believed that after this case was raised, the number of wonton vendors at night had decreased, so it was decided to retain the case.</p>
<p>Although these two extremely interesting cases have passed so lightly and easily, the problems still exist and have not been resolved. (Photo by our newspaper)</p>

<h3>New Review of the United Nations' Two Years of Work</h3>

<p>The General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council have held multiple meetings on this issue, focusing on repatriating refugees and resettling them. The countries of origin of the refugees requested their repatriation, while other member states firmly maintained that any refugee who had sufficient reason and knew all the facts should not be sent back to their country against their will.</p>
<p>On December 15, 1946, the General Assembly passed the constitution of the International Refugee Organization. The task of this organization is to repatriate refugees to their countries as much as possible, and for those who cannot be repatriated, to find ways to resettle them elsewhere and supervise their resettlement. The International Refugee Organization has not yet been established. A total of eighteen countries have signed the constitution, but only five of them have signed it unconditionally. The donations from these five countries only account for 19.47% of the first year's budget. The constitution must be ratified by at least fifteen countries before it can be implemented, and the funds must be at least 75% subscribed. However, the Preparatory Committee is already working and, from July 1st, is responsible for taking care of refugees on behalf of the International Refugee Organization.</p>
<p>In terms of trade, the United Nations has taken direct responsibility for conducting negotiations in Geneva to seek a general reduction in tariff barriers. A total of nineteen countries participated in the negotiations. The Economic and Social Council, in order to promote the expansion, production, exchange, and consumption of goods, agreed to convene an international conference in London. Before this conference is convened, a Preparatory Committee will be established to be responsible for drafting the constitution of the International Trade Organization. The Preparatory Committee has held meetings in London and New York successively, and is now continuing to meet in Geneva. At the same time, tariff negotiations in most countries are also underway, on a scale unprecedented in history. The International Trade and Employment Conference, under the auspices of the United Nations, will be held at the end of this year, and the location has not yet been determined. The draft constitution of the International Trade Organization will be submitted to the conference for discussion and approval.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, the United Nations has decided to establish institutions to provide expert assistance to member states. The Economic and Social Council has instructed the Secretariat to cooperate with various specialized agencies to assist member states in recruiting the experts they need and to provide research and other facilities. Several committees under the Economic and Social Council have also been authorized to provide technical or other assistance if requested by member states.</p>
<p>On June 19, 1946, the Economic and Social Council convened the World Health Conference in New York. In addition to the representatives of fifty-one member states, representatives from thirteen other countries attended as observers. The conference passed the constitution of a new international organization, the World Health Organization. This specialized agency will guide and coordinate international health work and carry out many tasks necessary to protect and improve world health. The World Health Organization can be established after sixteen member states of the United Nations ratify the signing. To date, fourteen countries have ratified, ten of which are member states of the United Nations. Before the International Health Organization is formally established, the interim committee is already working.</p>
<p>During the existence of the League of Nations, there was always an effective system that extended worldwide to control the production and distribution of narcotics. This responsibility has now been taken over by the United Nations. Forty-nine member states have signed the protocol of December 11, 1946, to amend the existing agreements on narcotics issues. The Economic and Social Council, at its recent meeting, also discussed measures to control narcotics in Germany and Japan, and recommended them to the governments of those countries. It has also begun new research on the effects of narcotics. In addition, it has asked countries where opium smoking is not prohibited to ban this evil habit and to prohibit the manufacture and sale of opium.</p>
<p>Work has begun on the International Bill of Human Rights (one of the most important tasks of the Human Rights Committee of the Economic and Social Council). The first draft of this bill is currently being drafted by the Drafting Committee and will soon be reported to the Economic and Social Council and the Human Rights Committee. The final draft is scheduled to be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion in 1948.</p>
<p>One of the human rights, the equal rights of women, is being studied by the Commission on the Status of Women. This committee has held its first meeting. When the General Assembly met in New York, it gave special discussion to the issue of women's suffrage and unanimously passed a resolution calling on all countries that have not yet allowed women to vote to grant women equal suffrage with men.

<h3>Stifled Trade Between Hong Kong and China After Implementation of New Import Control Measures: Large-Scale Guerrilla-Style Smuggling Rampant on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway</h3>
<p>— By our Special Correspondent, Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 16th (Air Dispatch)</p>
<p>Since the implementation of import control measures, the most affected has been Hong Kong. As everyone knows, Hong Kong is a bridge for trade between China and foreign countries. Foreign goods, after arriving in Hong Kong, must be transshipped to Shanghai, or transported through Guangzhou and then to the Chinese mainland. Hong Kong's own consumption is extremely weak. When the import control measures were first implemented, the standards were relatively lenient, and Guangzhou was still able to easily obtain import permits. However, on July 1st, a new "exchange settlement method" suddenly came into effect, followed by the stipulation that the second-quarter import quota could not be exceeded. According to this new regulation, each importer can only import US$93 worth of goods per quarter. Such a small figure is tantamount to mocking import merchants. The Guangzhou Import Management Sub-Committee stipulates that qualified importers must have more than 2 billion in capital. However, according to the quota allocated, each quarter importing US$93 worth of materials is probably enough even for a small vendor's capital. The contradictions and conflicts in government decrees often create a lot of jokes.</p>
<p>Since goods from Hong Kong cannot be transported inland, prices in Hong Kong have naturally plummeted. Legitimate merchants who have ordered goods from Britain and the United States are all complaining bitterly because, by the time the goods arrive, the market price may have fallen to half the cost. Therefore, Hong Kong's commerce has been completely stifled by domestic controls. Import-export merchants who can make a profit on the June settlement are few and far between.</p>
<p>These days, the Hong Kong business community has issued a chorus of dissatisfaction, believing that the new measures are a "suicide policy." Dong Zhongwei, Chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, said, "The government's unreasonable controls must be improved. Industrial raw materials and printing paper, which are urgently needed domestically, have skyrocketed in price due to overly strict controls, increasing the burden on the domestic population, causing factories to close down, and increasing unemployment, which is unimaginable." It is heard that from July 1st to 14th, no one in Guangzhou went through the procedures to apply for a permit in accordance with the regulations, which fully illustrates how disappointing and ridiculous the new measures are. Because of the government's unreasonable control over imports, "smuggling" has become particularly active in South China. Smuggling in South China is almost an open secret and is a large-scale organization. Legitimate merchants, forced by circumstances, have slowly joined their groups, which is a very painful thing to say.</p>
<p>There are no less than 20 smuggling organizations in Hong Kong. They guarantee the delivery of goods to Guangzhou. Ordinary goods are charged a 20% handling fee based on the price of the goods, and special goods such as cosmetics and telecommunications equipment are charged a handling fee as high as 50%. After you pay for the goods in Hong Kong, they take an equivalent bank deposit as a guarantee. If the goods are confiscated en route, they are responsible for compensation, and their credit is very reliable. They have special forces as protection, so the customs can do nothing. Newspapers often carry reports of "sea battles" between customs anti-smuggling ships and smuggling boats, and the winners are often the smugglers. For example, the Qingyuan gunboat of the Guangdong Customs encountered a smuggling boat in the deep of night on April 28th. After several hours of fierce fighting, it was finally escaped, and as many as 16 customs anti-smuggling personnel were killed or injured, which shows the extent of smuggling. In addition to the smuggled goods departing from Hong Kong, Macau is also a shortcut for smuggling. Macau is adjacent to Zhongshan County, and there are even more mysterious smuggling methods. Although the Ministry of Finance has sent personnel to Hong Kong again to study how to prevent smuggling, it has achieved no results. The main reason is that import laws and regulations are too strict, driving merchants to take this road, and the secondary reason is that there are people behind the smugglers, and they are afraid of hurting the rats if they throw the stones.</p>
<p>In addition to large-scale smuggling, there is also guerrilla-style smuggling. They use the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway as a tool and often carry small amounts of smuggled goods, bringing rice from Guangzhou to Hong Kong and bringing Western medicines and cigarettes from Hong Kong back to Guangzhou. There are now at least 3,000 smugglers running independently on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway.</p>
<p>Smuggling methods can be divided into four types: bypassing, deceiving, buying, and breaking through. Large-scale smuggling organizations naturally focus on buying passes and breaking through customs. Unorganized smugglers have to bypass customs and deceive customs. The revenue of the Guangdong Customs in April was 17 billion yuan, and it is estimated that it will only collect 4.5 billion yuan in July. If the government does not cut off the source of the problem and relax the control standards, not only will customs revenue become less and less, but also smuggling in South China will get out of hand.</p>

<h3>Social Services: Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Legal Interpretation</p>
<p>(1) Rent Deposit</p>
<p>Biao Benchu asks: A rented a house from the landlord (first landlord). A year ago, the landlord refused to accept the rent on the pretext of taking it back for his own use. May I ask (1) whether A can pay the rent to the bank in accordance with the deposit law. (2) When paying the rent monthly in accordance with the deposit law, in whose name should the deposit be made, and is it necessary to state the reason? (3) The landlord has refused to accept the rent for more than a year, but A has not yet moved out. He did not pay to the bank in accordance with the deposit law at that time. Can he make a lump-sum payment to the bank once a year today?</p>
<p>[Answer by Lawyer Jiang Pingfan] (1) A can deposit the rent in the bank. (2) The deposit should be made in the name of the landlord, and the amount of the rent should be deposited in the bank monthly. It is not necessary to state the reason. (3) The landlord has refused to accept the rent for more than a year, which is the landlord's own fault. There is no express legal provision as to whether A is willing to pay the one-year rent to the bank at one time, and he can do as he pleases.</p>
<p>(2) Inheritance of Estate</p>
<p>Wang Hao asks: A friend of mine, A, was adopted as an heir by his uncle in the first year of the Republic of China (1912). His uncle died in that year, and the property inherited by A has been managed by his uncle's concubine since his uncle's death. May I ask (1) when should A's inheritance of this property right begin? (2) The concubine has no legal status. Now that A is over 40 years old, can he sue her to recover this property right? (3) After A recovers the property right, is he obliged to support his uncle's concubine and illegitimate daughter?</p>
<p>[Answer by Lawyer Chuan Kuanglin] (1) A's right of inheritance began when his uncle, the deceased, died. (2) According to Article 9 of the Enforcement Law of the Inheritance Chapter of the Civil Code, the rights and obligations of the estate administrator established before the implementation of the Inheritance Chapter of the Civil Code shall be governed by the provisions of the Inheritance Chapter of the Civil Code from the date of implementation. The expenses of estate management shall be paid by the estate. He has no right to dispose of the estate, and now he can be sued to return it. If it is said that he infringed on the right of inheritance, he must be subject to the limitation of the statute of limitations. If he does not request recovery for ten years from the beginning of the inheritance, it will be extinguished due to non-exercise. (3) Persons who were continuously supported by the deceased during his lifetime shall be granted a portion of the estate by the family council according to the degree of support they received and other relationships. If they disagree with the decision of the family council, they may appeal to the court in accordance with Article 1137 of the Civil Code.</p>

<h3>Artist's Demeanor</h3>
<p>— Sun Fuxi</p>
<p>From Wei Fang Yuan to the Chinese Painting Circle</p>
<p>When I was in Kunming, Mr. Ji Kang lived in "Wei Fang Yuan." The flowers and trees were lush, and birds sang all around. I once painted Yunnan tea in this garden and wrote down my thoughts on viewing Dong Yuan's paintings in the garden.</p>
<p>Madam Liang Zheng Su, the owner of Wei Fang Yuan, is skilled in calligraphy and painting and hospitable. During the difficult life of the War of Resistance, we often had simple tea parties and wine gatherings to resist the suffering of materials with the spirit of literary and artistic research. This small gathering was held in rotation. Mr. Zhou Zijing was at the Academia Sinica in the western suburbs, Huang Yuke and Guangsheng were at the Chonglu residence of the Shanghai Bank, and Liu Xueran and I were at the Commercial Hotel, which I named "Heaven and Earth as Reading." Each gathering had programs such as collaborative painting and musical performances. Once, there was an exhibition of Annamese painters and an Annamese music performance. At that time, I often said, "The joy now is not surprising. In five or ten years, we will know that today's meaning is strong in retrospect." In less than five years, the memories of today have become many times richer than before.</p>
<p>The Yunnan Provincial Cultural Movement Committee initiated the first Yunnan Provincial Art Exhibition. I was the leader of the Art Group of the Cultural Movement Committee and served as the main backbone. I was the initiator and also the director of the National Art Army Exhibition. Every time an art exhibition was held, the affairs were busy, and there were not many assistants. Mr. Ji and Mrs. Liang both participated in the exhibition and helped with all the affairs, seeking public welfare and not counting private interests, so the donation results were very good.</p>
<p>At that time, there were more and more Allied forces gathering in Kunming. From the Flying Tigers to the 14th Air Force to various types of infantry, artillery, paratrooper, and transportation units, many new airfields were opened, and many new hostels were built. In short, everything in society changed greatly. Many people knew that there was a profit to be made and that the opportunity could not be missed. Under the name of the overall War of Resistance, some opened bars and dance halls, and some sold cigarettes, canned food, and American dollars. Even the children polished various Chinese copper coins and silver dimes and peddled them to American soldiers all over the streets as souvenirs of their trip to China, ripping them off mercilessly.</p>
<p>Professor Wu Yuseng (Mi) often interacted with British and American people. In view of the fact that the Allied forces had too little understanding of China, and that what China provided to the Allied forces was too boring and too humble, it was agreed that the person in charge of the American military hostel should write a letter inviting Chinese painters to hold an exhibition in the hostel's reception room and give lectures on painting. Mrs. Liang, Mr. Ji, and I went together, cooperating in painting performances, all of which were explained by Professor Wu in fluent English, which made everyone feel refreshed. This was of great benefit to the propaganda of Chinese culture, and Mr. Ji's works were sold at low prices in large quantities to the United States, not only spreading the good name of Chinese art, but also earning a considerable amount of American dollar foreign exchange.</p>
<p>At that time, Mr. Ji's works became the only high-end comfort items for the Allied forces.</p>
<p>We can tell at a glance that Mr. Ji's paintings are deeply rooted in the essence of the Northern Song Dynasty court. Whether it is flowers, plants, insects, birds, dragons, tigers, landscapes, or especially ladies, they are all magnificent and elegant. His deep skills are unmatched by ordinary people. However, he never copies or drafts. His lively and vigorous air comes entirely from his close contact with nature, so he can paint vividly and be full of aura.</p>
<p>Among the paintings shipped to the United States, flowers and birds were of course the most numerous, and ladies were not a few. At that time, there were four "Romance of the West Chamber" paintings, which were meticulously painted and had a light and subtle demeanor. Because they were not for sale, after many people enthusiastically sought them, they finally had to be separated and had to be restructured, re-weighed I don't know how many copies. Now, he has made a complete set of sixteen paintings, which are indeed masterpieces. There are also twelve "Hundred Horses" paintings, with a hundred horses of different shapes and colors arranged in the beautiful scenery of the twelve months of the year. Each painting has figures, indicating that they are all like Bole. However, the complete picture of Xixiang and the Hundred Horses were collected by Mr. Feng Peifen when he left Yunnan.</p>
<p>In addition to many excellent paintings, Wei Fang Yuan also produced a popular product: ancient costume beauties. Mr. Ji studied the costumes of various dynasties, and Mrs. Liang helped him make models for painting reference. Friends asked for them one after another, so he trained girls to produce them in large quantities. The head and hands were made of white rubber models, painted with colors, and painted with eyebrows, eyes, mouth, and nose, just like living people. The most wonderful thing is that the same model has different ages, personalities, and expressions of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness due to the different facial features painted. Many of these beauties were also given to the United States.</p>
<p>Mr. Ji reads books and paints behind closed doors, with the demeanor of an artist. Some envy his talent, and some laugh at his stupidity. In the eyes of artists, talent is not worth boasting about, and stupidity is not worth being ashamed of. Wandering in another world, it is enough to satisfy one's own ideals. Everything else is not what is asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Ji is not only good at meticulous brushwork, but also his freehand brushwork is outstanding, high, and ancient, which is unattainable. Mr. Ji is young and strong, and his future progress is limitless, but meticulous brushwork is too laborious and cannot be mass-produced by people over forty. Now that an exhibition is being held in the Chinese Painting Academy, appreciators should take a look as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Talking about Woodcuts from Outside the Door</h3>
<p>— One Table</p>
<p>In the seventh issue of the "New Woodcut" of the XXX newspaper, there is an article by Mr. An Huai entitled "Talking about New Woodcuts and Old Woodcuts," which discusses Mr. Xu Weinan's "Contradictions in the Woodcut World" published in this journal on June 22. I am completely an outsider when it comes to woodcuts; however, whether they are new or old, I like them all. Based on my poor experience of liking them, I cannot agree with Mr. An Huai's statement.</p>
<p>Mr. An said that the only "narrow" point of old woodcuts that is worth taking is that "the most basic nature of old woodcuts is only that they were valued for long-distance and mass distribution before the development of scientific plate making technology, which is the same as today's copper-zinc plates. Later, because some were finely crafted and more ancient and interesting than scientific plate making, they were appreciated by literati." He does not recognize that the carving skills of art woodcuts are an art, so he further said: "If this simple technology of copying is worth promoting, then today many photographers and scientific plate makers can also be praised as genius art sages. ..."</p>
<p>Mr. An seems to have only grasped a copy of the "Beiping Letterhead," and neglected the woodcut works of hundreds of years, so he denied that carving is also an art. The "Beiping Letterhead" is indeed a plaything used by literati such as Chen Shizeng and Qi Baishi to replace copper-zinc plates; however, it cannot be concluded that copying technology is equal to copper-zinc plates. The characters in Chen Laoyun's "Water Margin Pages" at the end of the Ming Dynasty are as vivid as life, and their eyes seem to radiate light; the shadow carvings during the Yongzheng period also have no major differences from the original works due to the superb carving skills. However, looking at the recently published "Water Margin" with copper pictures, those pictures, in addition to being "similar in form," are completely different in spirit. What is the reason for this? If it is not recognized that copying is also an art, why did Mr. Lu Xun use five-color rubber plates to print the "Beiping Letterhead" when he compiled it, and why did Mr. Xidi use carving when he compiled the "Illustrated Catalogue of Chinese Prints"? Especially the latter, part of it was first made into collotype plates, lithographed, and then carved and printed again. Woodcut paintings have the characteristics of woodcut paintings, just like other Gang paintings, all of which are a kind of art; and are different from photography. In today's era of developed plate making technology, Mr. An holds a steel knife to create, and does not seek copper plates and zinc plates. From the perspective of an outsider like me, I am afraid there is also a reason.</p>
<p>I don't know if Mr. An has read other old woodcuts besides the "Beiping Letterhead"? Chinese old woodcuts are not all copies. According to Mr. Xidi's research, Huang's father and son, the carving craftsmen of the Zhengpai prints, are all able to manage their own ideas. The "Zhuangyuan Tu Kao" is one of Huang Yingcheng's creations. It can be seen that Chinese carving craftsmen are not all the same as "photographers." Many talented artists of the past were regarded as "craftsmen" after their death, which is too sad.</p>
<p>Mr. An, who accepted Western woodcut art, may have "forgotten" that the West also has the art of copying. The "Beast Pictures," "Bird Pictures," and "Reynard the Fox" illustrations in England during the 18th and 19th centuries were all separated from drawing and carving. "People often think that prints are mostly imitations of famous works and are not an independent art. However, is it easy to extract the essence from famous paintings! ... It can be said that painters and woodcut artists are like the two wings of a bird and the changing wheels of a car, relying on each other for use." What Mr. Zheng Zhenduo said in the History of Chinese Prints is worth reading by Mr. An!</p>
<p>Considering copying as a copper-zinc plate and carving craftsmen as photographers, I don't know how many people besides Mr. An would agree with this statement!</p>
<p>Mr. An Huai pointed out that the current goal of woodcuts is "realism and national form"; this path is naturally correct. But he also said: "If it doesn't, won't it go into the horns of landscapes, flowers, birds, fish, and insects again"? I repeatedly suspect: I don't know if Mr. An has read other old woodcuts besides the "Beiping Letterhead"? From his words, it can be inferred that the old woodcuts in his mind are purely the "dead end" of landscapes, flowers, birds, fish, and insects; but there is a wider world in old woodcuts! Many illustrations of operas in the Ming and Qing dynasties, in addition to historical stories, had profound realism at that time; their themes were by no means limited to landscapes, insects, and fish. To give an example that is "suitable for both elegant and popular tastes"; Fei Danxu's "Yin Zhi Wen Tu Zheng" during the Daoguang and Xianfeng years is to persuade people to do good, punish evil, and teach people to believe in gods; (in that feudal, theocratic era, people naturally did not know what "realism and national form" were, and Shanghai naturally forgave them.) I don't know what is the difference in principle between the "sermons" of "Yin Zhi Wen Tu Zheng" and many woodcuts that "sermonize" for Marxism-Leninism today? It can be seen that old woodcuts are not purely a "dead end," it's just that the authors of new woodcuts have not accepted them well.</p>
<p>Mr. An finally mentioned "popularization." He believes that promoting old woodcuts is not as good as promoting comic strips; he also quoted Lu Xun's words, implying that old woodcuts seem to be "small decorations for literati and scholars." This sentence is naturally beyond question if the "Beiping Letterhead" is used as the "target." However, countless volumes of Buddhist scriptures, operas, and novels, especially woodcuts such as "Baixiao Tu Shuo," are still loved and read by the general public today. Can you say that they are not "popular"? Can you say that they are "small decorations for literati and scholars"?</p>
<p>With the above words, I am not obliterating the efforts of new woodcut artists in the past twenty years; on the contrary, the efforts of woodcut artists should be praised. However, as a new woodcut artist, Mr. An Huai, when he only knows "half of Europe and the United States" and only knows a copy of the "Beiping Letterhead," he completely denies the efforts of Chinese woodcut artists for thousands of years, and even says that they are all like photographers and plate makers. This narrow mind should not be possessed by an artist.</p>
<p>According to the editor: Although new woodcuts have only had a history of twenty years in China, they have been advocated by advanced literary circles and have participated in anti-war propaganda. Judging from the exhibits of the first national woodcut exhibition held in Shanghai by the Woodcut Association in April this year after the restoration, the content is rich and the results are quite impressive.</p>
<p>Of course, the average woodcut artist will not obliterate the fact that woodcuts have a history of thousands of years in China, have penetrated into the folk, and have established a national form. Naturally, there are also a few people who ignore traditional artistic skills and think that they are just imitations of Western plate spirits. Therefore, there is a debate between new woodcuts and old woodcuts. In fact, this problem is very common. Just like in literature, someone also felt that the vocabulary of spoken language was poor ten years ago and advocated learning from classical literary works. Originally, this was just a method of guiding young people to write. But at that time, it encountered a lot of criticism; and on the other hand, someone introduced the arguments that Shakespeare enriched the language of English-speaking countries and Pushkin enriched the vocabulary of Russian, which was unanimously recognized as the supreme truth. Therefore, this problem is just like arguing whether the moon is brighter in foreign countries or brighter in China, and there is no need to wait for a conclusion.</p>
<p>I always think like this: Chinese modern literature and art are indeed barren and poor. We need to learn, learn seriously, without favoring Chinese and foreign, ancient and modern, famous and famous works. All are objects of learning, but we should absorb their essence and eliminate their dross, which is also an old saying.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu's and Mr. Yiji's articles are also well-intentioned suggestions, re-prompting the woodcut world with a direction to adopt reference materials. From this point of view, I think Mr. An Huai will also agree. As for the limited space in this journal, the discussion on this issue is also intended to end here.</p>
<p>According to a letter from the author of this article, there are also pictures of the title page of "Mu Yun Saves Her Mother," carved by Huang Ting in Huizhou during the Wanli period, Meng Meinu of the Ming shadow carved Song edition of "Lienu Zhuan," and Qi Gai's "Dream of the Red Chamber Yong Tu" of the Qing Dynasty, which are planned to be inserted into this article. "Because I am afraid of damage during mailing, and I don't know if this manuscript is available, I have not attached them." I also declare on behalf of the author. (Editor)</p>

<p>I was indeed a little tired; their reasons did have some merit, so I discussed it briefly, exchanged some ideas, and let "04" use the military to escort Dingyuan back and inquire about Yaoqun's whereabouts.</p>
<p>During the period of military operations, especially when military affairs are busy and work is urgent, one of the most difficult problems for senior and junior generals responsible for commanding the battle is sleep. During the period of attack and defense, sufficient sleep is simply out of the question; being able to sleep peacefully for three or four hours is considered supreme happiness. However, sleep is also an indispensable condition for maintaining life; because without sleep, the brain cannot rest. Without rest, if the working hours are too long, even if you have the spirit of a dragon and horse, you will feel dizzy. Not to mention emergency finger placement, the most important issue of starting a new car at the right time, even simple mechanical work such as approval and reply will be wrong if the head is not clear.</p>
<p>Senior commanders, of course, have confidential secretaries, staff, staff officers, adjutants, etc., who can take over and handle things within a certain range, and can take a little time off to rest. At my level, especially my special work, which is so trivial, so complicated, so secret, and every question has a considerable weight, almost everything has to be handled personally; it is simply impossible not to handle it personally, so how can we get enough sleep? Moreover, as the naughty Miss Zishan of Bainin Manor said, seeing the work on this route of our troops is a life-threatening game that "risks three dangers," which is different from ordinary special agents. To tell the truth, we have to worry about things even in our dreams, fearing that if we relax our nerves for a moment, we will reveal the "three-fold" secret in our dreams; therefore, sleep is a very serious problem for us.</p>
<p>But the few people close to us all have their own "secrets" for sleeping: for example, "04," the eldest, doesn't need us to worry about him. His physique is even stronger than a water buffalo, so he has a natural virtue of being able to keep his eyes open for more than thirty hours. However, he also has a flaw. Sometimes when he gets sleepy, he hasn't even finished a meal, and the chopsticks and bowl are still in his hand, and he can immediately fall on the table, snoring loudly, and fall asleep in Handan. Once he is asleep, you can't wake him up even if you prick him with an awl. There is also a biggest problem. He likes to grind his teeth and saw his teeth in his sleep. The sound is like chewing pebbles; and while sawing his teeth, he keeps talking in his sleep. The wonderful thing is that he has a big tongue and a stutter. He uses Korean, Japanese, and Shandong dialects in his words, and no one can understand what he is saying.</p>
<p>As for Mr. W, it can be said that he has the spirit of a dragon and horse and seems to never need to sleep. As long as there is something to do, no matter when you go to see him, 24 hours a day, his slender and slightly protruding eyes are always lively and wide open. When asked why he doesn't feel tired, he always answers you with a smile, "It's not time to sleep yet!" According to his subordinates, he can sleep for three days and three nights when he has nothing to do. This is somewhat like the physiology of the American inventor Edison.</p>
<p>As for Tsurumi, he has practiced Japanese-style "endurance" in the army. He can stand there with his eyes open and sleep, he can also sleep while walking, and he can also talk while snoring; no matter how tired he is, as long as he encounters the stimulation of an important problem, he can immediately be refreshed. Just a basin of cold water is enough, and he can pour it on his head and face.</p>
<h3>On the Theory of Painting Having Teachers But No Sects</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>Chinese painting originated from hieroglyphs, was born out of fortune, and has changed a lot. From form to formlessness, spirit, artistic conception, fineness, meticulousness, depicting natural scenery, and exerting the author's spirituality, it is divided according to the author's personality and talent. The substantive value of painting lies in this, and the national spirit of painting also lies in this; there is no distinction between sects at first. Later generations forcibly divided painting into the Northern and Southern schools, the court style and the non-court style, the literati painting school, and even the regional schools, etc. In terms of the essence of painting, this is actually an extremely unfair statement.</p>
<p>Dong Qichang called Wang Youcheng the ancestor of the Southern School and Li Sixun the ancestor of the Northern School. This distinction between the North and the South is based on the difference between their ink rendering and green silk outlining. However, this water milling rendering and nephrite green outlining are only different in method and form, and there is no difference in the goal of depicting nature, performing scenery, and exerting the author's spirituality. Dong Qichang also said: "The Northern School has been followed by Liu Li Ma Xia... since the Li family and his son, and the Southern School has been followed by Jing Guan Dong Ju... since Mojie." Judging from the world-renowned paintings of Nuojia and reading the records of past dynasties, the works of Liu Li Ma Xia and Jing Guan Dong Ju may not have any fundamental differences. History said; "Dong Beiyuan wrote landscapes of Jiangnan, with colors similar to Li Sixun, and ink similar to Wang Wei." The true works of Wang and Li are rare in the world. I saw the Wang and Li paintings collected by the Forbidden City in the past, and I don't know if they are true works? In addition to Li's delicacy and Wang's vigor, they are also strict and solemn. Other famous works handed down from Dong Yuan include "Dongtian Shancang" and "Long Su Jiao Ying," which combine green and blue ink, and are no different from Liu Li.</p>
<p>As for the transmission of painting techniques, teacher inheritance has been around for a long time, but the great masters of the past, although they started by inheriting a certain family or a certain method, they must be able to create their own faces and open up new paths in the end. After they reach the peak, they can never be confined by a certain sect or school. If you are concerned about the gains and losses of a teacher and do not change for the rest of your life, your painting will not be a great success; this is why I say that painting has a teacher but no sect.</p>
<p>Mr. Ji Kang of Cixi, his ancestors were all proficient in painting, and his family learning was very profound. Figures, landscapes, flowers, birds, and insects are all wonderful. Recently, an exhibition was held in the Chinese Painting Academy. The author was introduced by the female painter Pang Zuowang and had the advantage of seeing the exhibition in advance. I deeply admire his exquisite painting cultivation, high-level technique inheritance, and the quiet and elegant spirit and breath. The famous horses and beauties he made are derived from Han Gan and Gu Kaizhi. "Double Horse Picture" and "Eight Horses" are straight into the room of Jin and Tang Dynasties. Landscapes, flowers, and birds are derived from Mi Gao Ma Xia, as well as Qian Shunkyu and Yun Nantian, combining the methods of green and blue ink, boneless double hooks. Among the figures and landscapes, I love "Fufu Gusong Mian Panhuan" the most, using the Songxue version, which is better than blue, and Shen Yinlao's inscription can be called a icing on the cake.</p>
<p>Looking at Ningfu's paintings, the charming and delicate atmosphere is implied in the neat and rigorous. It is impossible to limit it to a certain sect or school. Tracing the source, Li Longmian, Han Gan, Liu Songnian, Xia Yuyu, and Huang Quan, Xu Xi, Qian Shunkyu, and Tantian, are all teachers of Ningfu, and they integrate and are not limited to a certain school or sect and open up new paths. Ningfu is no longer far away</p>

<h3>Incoming Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>— Sea Breeze</p>
<p>In the past two days, the general price level in this city has declined. Aside from other reasons, the impending arrival of Japanese goods in China next month is also one of the main factors.</p>
<p>This opening of Sino-Japanese trade is purely of a private nature. According to sources such as Supervisory Committee member Mei, the total value of goods to be exported to China throughout this year is US$99,180,000, while the value of goods China will export to Japan is US$47,768,000. Offsetting the two figures, our trade deficit is US$50,000,000.</p>
<p>The majority of goods Japan exports are light industrial products, such as bicycles, watches, cameras, cotton goods, etc., which will be dumped into China in large quantities.</p>
<p>Those light, flimsy Japanese goods that we often saw ten years ago will reappear in the bustling cities across the country in a month or two.</p>
<p>Our government has adopted extremely cautious measures regarding the opening of private trade with Japan. According to the announced measures, there are approximately the following points: (1) There are still considerable restrictions on the selection of factory merchants applying to go to Japan; (2) The quota for commercial representatives to Japan is tentatively set at 64 people.</p>
<p>The main reason why the United States strongly advocates opening trade with Japan and adopts export subsidy policies for this export of Japanese goods is to gradually reduce the cost of American occupation in Japan. The recent US trade goal for Japan is to enable Japan to pay for imports with export earnings. If this goal can be achieved, US gold reserves will not continue to flow out.</p>
<p>According to statistics, since January of last year, the United States has spent US$3 billion in Japan.</p>
<p>And MacArthur's recent actions are aimed at this goal.</p>
<p>However, in China, the opening of trade alone is very unfavorable. Here is a brief introduction to the reactions from various parties:</p>
<p>(1) Supervisory Committee members Wan and others submitted a temporary emergency proposal on the 16th, requesting the government to stop considering opening trade with Japan. The reason is that the Sino-Japanese private trade deficit reaches US$50,000,000, and the goods China exports to Japan are extremely scarce in China, such as coal, etc. Therefore, before signing a peace treaty with Japan, the dispatch of a commercial delegation to Japan should be suspended.</p>
<p>(2) Chinese economic experts believe that the restoration of Sino-Japanese trade on August 15 is a kind of "economic aggression." At present, China has no goods to export, while Japan, whose industry has not suffered losses, will massively dump manufactured goods into China. In particular, MacArthur's regulation that Japanese trade with the United States is calculated in US dollars is tantamount to a "one-way traffic."</p>
<p>(3) The Northeast region believes that Japan's "starvation exports" mean that the Northeast currently has nothing to export, and North China only has salt, but salt can help Japan's military and chemical industries. The "Sino-Japanese economic cooperation" advocated by Japan before the "July 7th Incident" is now being gradually implemented under the American occupation.</p>
<p>(4) Private individuals believe that the labor cost in Shanghai is now eight times higher than in Nagasaki. How can they compete with Japan? After Japan opens up to foreign trade, not only will the Nanyang market be occupied by Japan, but China itself will become a flood zone for Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Based on these reasons, trade with Japan needs to be carefully considered.</p>

<h3>Between Civilization and Barbarism</h3>
<p>— Pu Lun</p>
<p>– A Record of Contrasts in Human Bodies</p>
<p>There is an interesting contrast between the bodies of barbarians and civilized people, as demonstrated in an exhibition by an Austrian graphic artist named Bernard Rudofsky.</p>
<p>Many famous graphic artists believe that the human forms they depict possess natural beauty, that is, the human body is inherently beautiful. However, Bernard Rudofsky denies this, saying that people are often very dissatisfied with their bodies. This mischievous theory of his has attracted much attention and interest.</p>
<p>Bernard Rudofsky has been studying this issue for quite some time, constantly playing with himself and his wife. He struggles with facts, trying to find materials on the human forms of barbarians and civilized people to prove his theory. Finally, he opened an exhibition and also authored a book on the subject.</p>
<p>His collected works include cartoons, silhouettes, plaster figures, and photographs. Among these works, the first to give us a deep impression is how ugly and fragile the women of the ancient cave dwellings were in every part. At the same time, the contrast between the bodies of barbarians and civilized people is particularly evident here.</p>
<p>For example, the corsets and bras worn by modern women are the same as the ancient women's tight waists and protected breasts. The glasses of 1900 emphasized aesthetics rather than practicality, which is similar to the function of the glasses of 1946. The mask-like headgear worn by women in the Arab state of Oman is surprisingly similar to glasses. Burmese women still retain more than a dozen brass rings around their necks, resembling giraffe cubs, which is somewhat similar to the neck bead circles worn by women in the Victorian era of England. The bound feet of Chinese women are similar in shape to wearing high heels. From birth, the heads of African children are always tightly wrapped in cloth, shaped like cylinders, which is similar to the hairstyles of modern women today. The high-backed and shapely aprons worn by women in the Victorian era of England are exactly the same as the particularly swollen buttocks of women of a certain Hottentot tribe in South Africa. Recently, women have been wearing earrings with two pieces facing each other on one ear, which is similar to the women of another African tribe, the Sandagulus, who pierce their ears and hang ornaments. Modern women's clothing and even the colors of chairs are similar to the people of the Marquesas Islands in the South Pacific, who have tattoos from their faces, arms, lower bodies, all the way to their toes. Some primitive tribes have brides who are half-naked, which is somewhat similar to the half-naked fashions of 1946. Virgins in the Congo region of Africa wear a piece of cloth around their arms on their naked bodies to show chastity, which is also similar to the latest women's clothing, which also has a circular piece of cloth extending from the back.</p>
<p>In addition, dissatisfaction with human appearance began in primitive times, because that was the period when humans fought against beasts, so there was a feeling of inferiority to animals. Human skin was not as beautifully colored as the feathers of birds, humans were not as strong as dogs, and were even easier to fall than groundhogs. Therefore, they tattooed their skin with patterns and painted it with colors. They made their eyes shine like the eyes of an eagle, and women tried their best to seek their unnatural walk. Regardless of whether their consciousness is right or wrong, it is at least an expression of their dissatisfaction with their bodies.</p>
<p>The history of the human body is a part of human history. From ancient times to the present, the bodies of civilized people have become more and more beautiful.</p>

<p>— Compiled by Xiao Zu</p>
<p>A Monument to Corruption</p>
<p>Meng Zhu, the former magistrate of Yueqing County, Zhejiang Province, was impeached by the Control Yuan for corruption and dereliction of duty during his tenure. An order was issued to the province for punishment. The people of the county pooled funds of tens of millions to erect a "Meng Zhu Corruption Monument" in the city center, with a statue of Meng Zhu engraved on it, followed by Meng's dereliction of duty, totaling two thousand words. The monument is being carved by Liu Kaiqu from the sea and is expected to be completed this month. A grand ceremony will be held upon completion of the project.</p>
<p>Cooperation between Prostitutes and Merchants</p>
<p>The Xinxin District of Shimen City, Hunan Province, is far west of the urban area, with only brothels isolated in the area, far from the city, so business is very bleak. Recently, the acrobatics industry and the brothel industry in the city felt that their relationship was close and that cooperation was necessary. They jointly petitioned the municipal government, proposing to designate the area where the brothels in Xinxin District are concentrated as a market, so that merchants and prostitutes can cooperate and the urban area will not be difficult to prosper. The municipal government has approved the relocation and instructed the police to handle the selection of the site.</p>
<p>Love Group</p>
<p>The "Love Group" in Nanchang is reorganized. It is reported that the group will dispatch capable cadres to various major cities such as Shangrao, Jiujiang, and Ganxian to actively carry out activities. The members of the group are all intellectual young men and women, especially many young women. The purpose is to use "sex" as capital and "love" as a means to obtain material enjoyment. The initiator is a female student surnamed Xiong in Nanchang, who serves as the head of the group, with a chief of staff, also a woman. Below are several groups, each with a group leader and ten members, half male and half female. Every ten small groups form a large group, with a director. Recently, the group stipulated that all members should gather at the Nanchang Provincial Stadium every Sunday.</p>
<p>Tears of Opium Prohibition</p>
<p>During a recent general meeting of the Sichuan Provincial Assembly, many assembly members criticized the increasingly serious opium problem in Sichuan Province and expressed doubts about the anti-drug work. Assembly member Jin Xiaogeng said: "When anti-drug supervisors go to the border areas to investigate opium, the sedan chair carriers are often opium addicts. He not only dares not arrest them, but also dares not let them know what he is doing, otherwise he will not be able to find anyone to carry him."</p>
<p>Honest Intimidator</p>
<p>Sun Honglin, the president of the Jiangsu Provincial High Court, received two threatening letters in his residence, demanding two hundred million yuan from Sun. The sender signed Pan Renyi and specified a detailed address. The Suzhou Police Department arrested him at the address and sent him to the procuratorate for interrogation. After a forensic examination, it was found that the Pan had severe neurasthenia, and the result was a suspended sentence of two years. — Dongfang Jing</p>
<h3>Dragonflies are Greedy, Beetles are Surprisingly Strong</h3>
<p>— Dongfang Jing</p>
<p>A beetle can drag something forty times heavier than itself. If the beetle were as big as a horse, it could drag a car weighing 100,000 pounds.</p>
<p>The pyramids are 410 feet high, and the tallest skyscraper in the world is 1,250 feet high, which is only more than two hundred times taller than a six-foot-tall person. However, there is a kind of white ant in Africa whose nests are a thousand times taller than their bodies.</p>
<p>The larvae of a certain black fly can jump out of a four-inch-deep box. If humans had this jumping ability, they could jump up to eight floors with just one kick. Fleas can jump a distance two hundred times longer than themselves. If humans had the ability of fleas, they could jump more than a thousand feet.</p>
<p>Imagine a person with a good appetite sitting there in the afternoon eating roast chicken, one every five minutes, all afternoon. Of course, this is just a fantasy. But if humans had the appetite of dragonflies, it would not be surprising to eat a chicken every five minutes. A dragonfly eats forty flies in two hours. Dragonflies are the most voracious creatures in the world. As long as it has something to eat, it will be at ease even if it is on a needle bed. A biologist once cut off the tail of a dragonfly and fed it into its gluttonous mouth.</p>

<h3>A Week in the Film World</h3>
<p>— Li Zhen</p>
<p>The Academy Award-Winning "Mildred Pierce"</p>
<p>In recent years, Hollywood has been plagued by a shortage of scripts. Therefore, many American bestsellers and popular novels, regardless of their literary value, have been adapted into movies by filmmakers to fill the needs of the producers.</p>
<p>"Mildred Pierce" is based on James M. Cain's popular novel. The story is the one commonly seen in movies. However, this script has its considerable merits in terms of writing technique.</p>
<p>The story depicts a mother who sacrifices everything for her beloved daughter, even selling herself, but what she pursues is a tragic result. The script's depiction of the social life of American capitalism is true and vivid. It portrays those Americans who are doing business all day long, and even when they are in love and forming families, they are accustomed to solving problems in a businesslike manner. This at least allows us to understand one aspect of the life of a money-oriented society. Besides that, there is only the pitiful mother who dotes on her daughter and still suffers the consequences.</p>
<p>Joan Crawford, who won the Academy Award, does have superb and sophisticated acting skills in this film. But we must recommend director Michael Curtiz's excellent skills. He handled the whole play naturally and meticulously. Even the flashback method, which is the most difficult to please, is so smooth and seamless under his use. The use of the camera is also worth studying by those who love film art. Technically, the photography, lighting, and recording are all excellent.</p>
<p>The Mediocre "Beyond a Reasonable Doubt"</p>
<p>Alan Ladd is a rising star in Hollywood in recent years, and this "Beyond a Reasonable Doubt" is being promoted as his first film after returning to the film search after demobilization. However, the content of the script is a Hollywood cliché, temptation, worldliness, assassination, framing, and revenge, linking these many plots together to form this story.</p>
<p>Alan Ladd does not have better acting skills, but William Bendix's Buzz has rich creativity, and Howard St. John's hoodlum Harv Howard is quite good. Doris Dowling's Helen, the female lead, has too weak acting skills.</p>
<p>The Nonsensical "The Bachelor's Daughters"</p>
<p>A clerk disguised as a gentleman and tricked a young lady into love. This is not breaking the class love, but a "suspended" story in the ideological sense of emptiness in life. The story is written nonsensically and far-fetched. The director and actors have no merit.</p>
<p>The Hollow "House of Horrors"</p>
<p>This is another detective film that uses tension, stimulation, horror, and love as its selling points. The story itself is mediocre and not worth taking.</p>
<p>The director's handling of the play also fails to grasp the style of the play. This is just a cliché third- or fourth-rate film.</p>
<p>The Unremarkable "Blind Spot"</p>
<p>When Hollywood screenwriters can't find newer detective film themes, they think of this "Blind Spot". This "Seeing Eye Dog" is used as the protagonist, and the blind detective is used as a foil, but the story in the script still lacks a realistic basis. Furthermore, there are no particularly amazing arrangements for the "Seeing Eye Dog" in the film. The blind detective, on the other hand, is arranged in a way that seems unreasonable.</p>
<p>Edward Arnold, who plays the detective, has extremely calm and experienced acting skills. Lola Lane's Laurena is merely competent.</p>
<p>Two Musical Films</p>
<p>Nelson Eddy's "Make Mine Music" and Fred Astaire's "Yolanda and the Thief", the former uses fifteen famous songs as a selling point, while the latter boasts fifteen color films. However, regardless of the story content and performance techniques, "Yolanda and the Thief" is inferior to "Make Mine Music". Even if it is a film in fifteen colors, it still cannot save the emptiness in the script and teaching techniques. At least, the songs in "Make Mine Music" are worth listening to.</p>
