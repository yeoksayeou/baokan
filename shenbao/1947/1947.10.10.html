<h3>主席國慶書吿全民　指示今後工作方向　掃除障礙建設現代國家</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕蔣主席發表國慶紀念日吿全國國民書，交長三千字，指示今後一年間同胞工作方向。　政治方面，樹立民主法治基礎，提高選舉水凖，整肅政治風氣。　經濟方面，貫澈民生主義設施，切實籌劃扶植民營企業，解決土地問題。　文化方面，爭取學術思想的獨立，以為今後文化建設的基本方針。　社會方面，實行勤倹，刻苦的生活，發揮自立，自强的志氣。最後勗勉同胞，對內努力共赴上述四點標的，對外乘持獨立自主精神，和平合作宗旨，自立於世界，建設中國為統一與進步之現代國家，戡平叛亂，掃除建國的障礙。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕蔣主席於雙十國慶前夕發表「卅六年國慶紀念日吿全國國民書」，全文如次：</p>
<p>今天是中華民國三十六年國慶紀念日，中華民國憲法巳於本年元旦公布，國民大會代表和立。監兩院的選舉，將於本年年內完成，而憲法即將全部實施，我們在此訓政結束，憲政　軔的時期來紀念中華民國的生長，更感覺其意義重大了。</p>
<p>在過去一年間，國民政府召開了國民大會，頒定了憲法，集合各黨派，無黨派領袖人士參加政府，共負建國的責任，在今後一年間，更將迎接憲政政府的誕生，完成建國大綱的程序，在這三十六年間，全國仁人志士愛國民衆相率集中於三民主義旗職之下，為完成建國實施民主而奮鬥，但在事實上，先有　世凱玩弄約法而毀棄約法，纔而封建軍閥託名自治，以割據自雄，最後則共黨匪徒假借民主，而破壞民主，一部民國憲政史，乃是建國護法與叛國毀法兩個力量艱苦鬥爭的紀錄。到了今日，民主憲政接近了最後成功，而共匪顚覆國本，毀法亂紀的陰謀暴行，也達到了最兇很，最殘忍的階段，我們不能聽任民主憲政功敗垂成，我們必須維護社會秩序，保障人民幸福，更須鞏固領土主權，以完整的國家付託於即將成立的憲政府，纔算是盡了革命建國的責任。自從國軍克復延安以後，共黨匪徒巳完全暴露其流寇的本來面目，他一方面調集冀　邊區的部隊，分途流竄，一方面訂定地下工作綱領，指揮他潛伏各地的匪黨與外　份子，企圖在國軍後方煽動各種風潮，開闢其所謂「第二戰塲」，但是他主要目標，仍在固守膠東，以維持關內外匪軍的交通綫，所以他渡黃河南下的流寇！最初目的在於分散國軍的力量，以策應他東北的攻勢，解救他膠東的危急。到了國軍掃蕩膠東，收復烟台，共匪旣定的戰略，是全　失敗了，關內外匪軍的聯絡，是完全截斷了，於是他在關外發動其所謂「第六次攻勢」，企圖澈底破壞我東北領土主權，他在關內則是企圖在桐柏山區與大別山區建立茍延殘喘的根據地，更妄冀威脅我長江中部的安全，並阻撓鄰近各區的普選，我在此必須指出，共匪在東北的蠢動，無論如何猛烈，終必循着第五次攻勢的先例，遭受澈底的懲創。（下接三版左角）</p>
<h3>以崇法務實精神　求國家自力更生　張院長發表國慶紀念文</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕行政院院長張羣，於雙十節前夕發表國慶紀念文，題為「開國與建國」全文約二千言，首述中華民國開國以來，國內外情勢。次乃指出今日內部方從事於建設力量與破壞力量之爭，民主力量與反民主力量之爭；吾人加强建設，即可以抵消破壞力量，實施憲政，即所以消滅反民主力量，吾人不應將建設期之於統一安定之後。論及今日中國之建設問題，張氏强調節約與崇法務實之重要。在結論中，張氏謂：世界環境斷不再給予中國以更多猶預時期，無論局勢如何，吾人均須以崇法務實，刻苦儉約之精神，以求國家之自力更生。</p>
<p>〔又電〕中央廣播電台，為渡祝卅六年國慶，特舉行紀念廣播，十日晚八時，請行政院張院長岳軍播講「國慶日談對於普選之希望」，該台用四五四公尺，六六〇千週波，二五·三五公尺，一一八三五週波，三〇〇〇公尺，九七三〇千週波，周時播送。</p>

<h3>曾琦發表國是感想</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕國慶前夕，靑年黨主席會琦發表對國是感想。略謂：欲撥亂返治，起衰振廢，必須正本淸源，對症下藥。世人每以物價高漲，認經濟問題為第一，予則以為因政治引起軍事，因軍事影　經濟，故仍以政治問題為第一，解決政治問題之方案雖多，而其最大關鍵，則在行憲。並稱：要使行憲圓滿，則須　共同制憲之三黨，不因競選而妨害合作；　須絕對保持民主作風，嚴禁賄選，免為外人恥笑，　須成立立含有廣大的包容性的憲法內閣，抱人才主義，而不以三黨為限。　須全國上下，嚴格實行憲法，視為神聖尊嚴而無絲毫之違犯。</p>

<h3>蒲立特主張　美大舉援華</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約八日電〕前美駐蘇大使蒲立特新自亞洲離國，八日警吿稱：如美國任令中國落入斯達林之掌握中，「包括日本全亞洲遲早將入其手中」。亞放之人力及資源，將被用以反對美國，美國之獨立，不能較中國之獨立長過二十年」。蒲氏要求政府採取對華之三年計劃，依此計劃，美應給中國十三萬五千萬元之軍事政治財政三方面之援助。</p>

<h3>國慶感言</h3>
<p>民國三十六年的國慶紀念日，今天我們又逢到了！國慶日，報紙條例應有祝頌之辭。在此戡亂建國期間，我們緬懷過去，檢討現今，瞻望將來，眞是一則以喜，一則以懼，感想萬千，一言難盡。「人逢喜氣精神爽」，我們逢此一年一度的國慶，追念光烈的功業，革命的成果，自應振作精神，歡欣鼓舞。然而環顧大憶，不但國內情勢與去年前年身迥異，抑在世界大局，亦已發生重大變化。來日大難，方興未艾，吾人當無因國慶而自我陶醉的雅興。</p>
<p>前年國慶日是，離勝利未久，但在國際上旣充滿了和熙的陽光，樂觀的空氣，而且在國內也是氣象一新，全國的人民都沉醉在慶祝勝利的狂歡裏。曾幾保時，一年易過，到了去年的國慶日，已由絢爛而趨於平淡，整個世界漸爲愁雲慘霧所籠罩，而在國內又到處聽見一片殺伐之聲。但是去年今日，希望縱微，究還未絕。國際的陰霾並非不可吹散，國內的和談也仍紛其成功。今年則滿　街市雖掛滿了青天白日滿地紅的國旗，一如往歲，而人們的心頭，大都蒙着沉重的暗影，人們的足下，大都帶着沉重的步伐！</p>
<p>我們先看世界大局。戰後國際，波瀾迭起，儘管若干政治家外交家終年東奔西走，致力於世界和平的締造，開了不知多少次的國際會議，但是問題不僅未能覓致解決方案，而且愈弄愈複雜，愈鬧愈惡劣。這種情勢的存在，雖令人氣短，但在去年，人們還以爲戰時所憧憬「一個世界」的理想，終有實現的可能。到了今日，客觀的事實，使我們對此連一綫的希望也不敢直說可以保有了。別的不必說，僅以歐洲共產國際的再出現一事而論，也就可以知道今日的世界已到分裂的前夕。再瞧瞧聯合國機構，也已到了存亡的關頭；有否決權的存在，足使聯合國機構不能發揮其功能，若欲加以修正，不論予以限制或取消，則有使蘇聯退出聯合國的可能。美國國務卿馬歇爾所提出的建議，若爲聯合國大會所通過，勢必引起蘇聯的强烈反對；蘇聯代表辛斯基對此，早已有去就力爭的表示。放眼看今日的世界，國大壁壘的對立，已逐漸趨於明朗。這種趨勢的形成，當非世界各國之種；戰後世界和平尚未締造成功，而戰時駢層作戰的盟國却已分道揚鏣。新的世界危機，如果不早日設法挽救，則人類的浩刧，不久就要發生在我們的眼前。試問我們還有什麼心情來狂歡？</p>
<p>戰後我國迫切需要的，原是和平與安定。對外企來國際上的和平，好在和平的空氣中，埋頭於復興建國的工作。中國經過八年抗戰血的敎訓，痛定思痛，在戰後就該抓住時機，埋頭建國，充實國力。國際和平愈久，我國的國力也可望愈能充沛。對內則我們亦必力求安定。在抗戰八年之後，不論在國家或在人民，都已精疲力盡，大家都需要安定，好在安定的環境裏休養生息，獲得復元的機會，然後始能走上建國的大道。</p>
<p>但是世界和平旣似乎愈去愈遠，而我國內局勢，因爲共匪有擾亂，全國騷然，幾無寗日。在匪區的民眾，固不啻生活在水深火熱之中，就是其他地方，也因爲共匪破壞交通，摧毀生產，以致物價高漲，生活艱難，眞有所謂「民不聊生」的景象。最近共匪向各省亂竄，更使人民流離失所，不能安居樂業。政府對於戡亂，雖已集中全力進行，但戡亂的成效，有賴於全國人民的通力合作。我們爲應付未來的國際巨變計，爲謀解除民眾的痛苦計，都應該在國慶聲中，加倍努力戡亂，使共匪早日肅清，國家得以安定，然後積極建設，增强我們在國際發言的力量，庶幾有造於未來的世界和平。</p>
<p>歡迎英國議會訪華團</p>
<p>英國議會訪華代表團，由英國工黨元老亞蒙勛爵率領，前來中國作親着訪問，中途因氣候惡劣，一再延期，至昨日午後五時許，始自香港飛抵上海，當即乘坐原機飛往首都，晋謁我國當局。我們對於英國議會該　華團諸君的蒞臨，除表示熱烈歡迎而外，並認爲此行在中英邦交上將發生重大作用。</p>
<p>第一，中英關係，在過去雖不能認爲友好無間，但自第二次大戰以來，患難與共，盟誼之深，已非泛泛。現雖還有若干問題存在，有待磋商解决，但相信在英國工黨賢明政府之下，不難獲得合理解決，使中英邦交展開新頁。今日英國朝鮮對於中國，無不士分關切，誠如亞蒙勛爵所說：「今日我國議會及人民，關心中國之程度，一如戰時。」我們對於英國處境之了解，亦莫過於今日。</p>
<p>第二，中英兩國在今日之世界，所處地位，幾乎完全相同。在戰時，中國在亞洲，孤軍奮鬥，獨力支持對日戰爭；英國則在法國戰敗投降之後，也屹然不動，與納粹作殊死戰。在戰爭勝利之後，中英兩國又因所受的損失最大，所作的犧牲最慘，都遭遇到許多困難，至今還沒有恢復平時的狀態。所以中英兩國，不僅是戰時的盟邦，而且也是戰後的患難朋友，應該互相協助，共渡目前的難關。</p>
<p>第三，英國工黨內閣的內政外交，是最值得我們稱道的。法治的精神，內政的修明，固爲世人所欽佩，就是它所採取的開明外交政策，更博得世界各國的稱譽。最近英國內閣局部改組，起用大批年青有爲的政治家，使艾德禮內閣成爲世界上最富於朝氣的政府，尤其值得我們效法，以革新我們的政治作風。</p>
<p>第四，戰後英國在國際上所處的地位，雖已發生了重大的變化，但仍不失爲遠東有關大國之一。我們要奉告英國議會訪華代表團諸君，戰後遠東問題的核心，乃在如何防制日本侵略勢力的再起。中英兩國固均願與日本和平相處，但決不能放任日本反動勢力之死灰復然。不論爲中國的安全打算，或爲英國的利益着想，過於放縱日本，使它的軍閥財閥可以借屍還魂，一定要種下他日的禍要。所以中英兩國在未來的對日和會中，應該站在一條戰綫上，反對任何過度放縱日本的辦法。</p>
<p>英國議員諸君均係初次來華訪問，胸無成見，比較容易認清中國的實情。但願諸君返國以後，將其所得中國人民如何在政府領導之下奮鬥以渡難關的印象，以及中國人民對英關切的情緒，告諸全國朝野。</p>
<h3>宋子文廣播詞</h3>
<p>（上接一版）宋氏廣播詞略稱：「本人抵此後，就各方看來，我同胞生活困苦，至於極點，本人寢食難安，亟思挽救之法。回憶民十二年時奉國父命，開辦中央銀行，當時祇奉准開辦費毫洋三千針孔，本人旣奉命令，只好努力去做。國父更面諭，謂辦事必須脚踏實地，發行紙幣不光是可兌，而且必須能現兌，必須有充分硬幣收入，才能發生適當數額之紙幣，如此自不會通貨膨脹。在北伐時期，寗可忍受一時痛苦，而不能任通貨膨脹而蒙受長期痛苦。國父於英行成立典禮中，曾說只可吃鷄蛋，不可吃鷄。此實爲辦理一切事業至理名言。本人仰賴訓示，排除一切困難，至北伐時，央行紙幣每元甚至已超過銀幣一元票面價格，後本人又奉命任國府財政部長兼廣東財政廠長，以前粵省全年收入最高不過二千餘萬，本人接事後，漸增至一億元。民十五年蔣主席誓師北伐，十六定都南京，北伐軍之兩原能供應無缺，此全由當時剔除中飽，涓滴歸公有以致之。廿年後歸來，我粵經濟財政困難枯竭，竟一至於此。惟廣東出產富饒，人口亦眾，人才更不少，只須全省公務人員遵照國父脚踏實地之訓示爲辦事精神，實在去想，實在去做，剔除中飽，涓滴歸公，相信廣東必能日臻安定，日臻安樂」。</p>
<h3>航業面臨嚴重危機　噸位增加數字</h3>
<p>（上接一版）李氏首就國籍輪船噸位增加數字報告稱：我國商船戰前原有五十萬噸，戰時犧牲百分之四十，復員初期殘餘之船舶，尚不足十萬噸，至去年雙十節，增爲四九一·九七九噸，一年來又增加三十五萬噸，全國現有噸位共爲八四三·三一五噸，其中招商局佔三十萬噸，民生公司五萬四千餘噸，中國油輪公司五萬二千餘噸，益祥輪船公司一萬八千餘噸，大違大通一萬二千餘噸，用煤與用汕之船各佔半數。現在長江，蘇北，滬甬溫，滬台，滬青，滬津，滬禦各綫交通，均較前便利；另有十餘輪航行印度，南洋羣島及美洲。各公司向國外訂購即將陸續來華之船舶，共約二十萬噸，百萬噸初步建設之目標，不久可望達到。</p>
<p>李氏繼申述維護航權之重要，指出一年來外商屢次企圖以種種之掩護，覬覦我國航綫之種事實，幸賴政府與人民之船員於收回不久之內河及　　航行權，加以不斷之愛護，得保領水之完整。</p>
<p>成本激增不已</p>
<p>李氏次報告航行成本之激增不已，實爲航業界一年來最大之痛苦，例如工人生活指數之增高燃煤每噸官價由十一萬元增至九十二萬元，燃油每噸官價，由十四萬四千元增至二百八十二萬元，而船聯對於運價調整，向極愼重，以致緩緩增加之收入，遠趕不上突飛猛進之成本。昨（八）日美孚，亞細亞等油公司公佈之配油每噸價格，精柴油四〇六萬元，中柴油三八一萬元，重柴油三六九萬元，燃油二八二萬元（關稅附加稅在內），較前配價激增四倍之多，例如景興輪船來回青島一次，用油一百八十噸，即需五億零七百六十萬元，收入僅敷購汕之用。其餘薪工，修理，用物等開支，均無着落，已有用油輪船多艘，被迫停航。此嚴重問題，設不急謀解決，各公司大部輪船勢亦將被迫停航。</p>

<h3>新共產國際成立後　中國赤匪將益猖獗　吳鐵城敦促人民戡亂建國</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕南京中央日報記者，昨以新共產國際在波京成立後，其將來的發展與遠東，尤其是中國的影響如何？特訪吳秘書長鐵城，詢其意見。吳氏告稱：新共產國際成立，使動盪不安的國際局面，更趨嚴重，遠東西南亞各弱小民族的民族自由解決運動，將遭受不利的影響，我國赤匪乘機愈形猖獗，自不待言。吳氏繼謂：中國在此種情勢下，全國人民尤其是國民黨黨員，爲國家安全，民族獨立，更應加倍警惕，各就其崗位，更應加倍警惕，各就其能力和財力，向一個目標奮鬥，努力。此目標爲何？即戡亂建國。因戰後人民所受的苦難，是八年抗戰勝利應付的犧牲代價，勝利後，此種苦難不能减少，甚或加重，皆是共匪一手造成，吾人不能容許人民遭受的苦痛長此存績，故首須消滅共匪。</p>
<p>關於共產國際宣言的國際意義，吳氏稱：二次大戰後，民主主義抬頭，在此主流下，國際間一切關係是互助的，不是侵略的，新共產國際，譴責英美援歐，南美·及遠東爲帝國主義行爲，純係政治上的籍口，此種宣傳性的口吻，中國人廿年來已自共匪口中屢聞不鮮。總之公理不能離開事實，任何謬爲的宣傳，祇能欺騙一時，不能朦混永久。</p>

<h3>小啟</h3>
<p>欣逢雙十，舉國騰歡，本報值茲良辰，特增出三張半，其中篇什，類多革命壯烈史實，或屬歌頌激勵之詞，不僅富於歷史價值，尤足激發戡亂動員鬥志。徒以篇幅有限，各方文詞均未克發表，用申謝忱，並誌歉意。又特刊排印匆促，致將「八十年來之中國航運」一文誤拚，第二十一版最末行「須用英國輪船担任」，應接排第十七版第十五行「運輸，否則情願不受接濟」等句，特此勘誤，尚祈作者讀者鑒原不！</p>
<h3>主席告全國國民書</h3>
<p>至於內匪軍，已陷於孤立的境地，國軍對流亡黃河以南的股匪，必能嚴密追憶剿，予以包圍和消滅，絕不使其陰謀得逞。然而我們必須警覺，在膠東共匪失敗之後，這一個短期間內，只要各地國軍和各級政府有一點疏忽的處所，他們必乘機蠢動，在鄉村則隨時可有暴動，在城市則隨處可有風潮，這一類倒行逆施的行動，其目的就在於破壞社會的安定，惟有民眾與政府通力合作，持之以定力，貫之以信心，不搖不奪，擊破奸謀，在政治·經濟·文化與社會各方面，作密切配合的努力，纔能消滅這個破壞國家，破壞憲法，擾害民生的匪徒，完成戡亂建國的使命。</p>
<p>今後一年工作方向</p>
<p>中正謹掬衷心，指出今後一年間工作的方向，深望全國同胞共同努力，以促其實現。</p>
<p>政治方向　（一）在政治方面，必須樹立民主法治的基礎，而提高選舉的水準，整肅政治的風氣，尤爲當務之急，這裏要分兩點說明：甲，在今年元旦憲法公布之後，選舉法規業已如期頒布，各省市選舉人與候選人的登記次第告成，各省市候選人競選的活動，也正在熱烈進行之中。要知道這次選舉的得失，將決定憲政的成敗，選舉人必須愼投其神聖之一票，而候選人更應自重自愛，矯正民國初期選舉的一切弊端，提出政見，以供廣大選民自由的抉擇，我們必使選舉有嚴正的風氣，纔可望選舉有崇高的成就。我們可以說，今年的選舉，是中華民國再建的樞紐，也就是中華民族復興的指標，惟有全國人民皆能擇取其所能信任的代表，行使政權，纔可望全國民皆能擁護民主憲法永垂不朽。乙·民主的基礎在法治，當此憲下令準備將告完成之前夕，政府與人民必須協力，以共求法治精神的貫澈，人民應養成其守法的習慣，而官吏更當事事以法律爲依據，務使政治風氣趨於整肅，人民權利得到保障，共進於法治之正軌，而後民主制度始有其堅實的基礎。</p>
<p>經濟方面　（一）在經濟方面，必須貫流民生生義的設施，關於民營企業的扶植，土地問題的解決，尤須切實籌劃，抗戰結束之後經濟建設，爲舉國一致的要求，而經濟建設的中心目標，是在工業化的過程之中，解決土地問題，使社會生產得以增進，農民生活得以改善，而農村購買力的增加，爲工業產品培植廣大的市塲，更是都市繁榮的基本條件。我們知道，民生主義的工業政策，是以國營的制度限制獨佔資本操縱民生，以保障一般民營企業之自由發展，政府的賦稅制度，銀行的投資方針，都應配合這一個政策，而後社會生產可望進步，出口貿易可望增加，要知道藏富於民，即所以求國力之增殖，中正在前年雙十節，已向全國同胞提出這個原則，作爲戰後建國事業的方針，今天更重申此意，深願全國經濟界人士能與政府合作，期其切實實施，奠定我中華民族自力更生的基礎。</p>
<p>文化方面　（二）在文化方面，必須爭取學術思想的獨立，遠在抗戰結束之前，中正即爲文化界指出「第二次世界大戰可以說是文化戰爭，歐美三百五十年來，民族主義，民主主義與社會主義的成敗興亡，皆在此一役，而中國五千年悠久的文化及其道德精神之興廢，亦以此役爲試金石」。在第二次世界大戰結束已逾兩年，而國際文化鬥爭與政治風雲同臻激化，中國文化也飽受共黨匪徒政治鬥爭的影響，抗戰期間堅貞勇毅的民族精神，被其　喪，漸就消沉，尤以知識青年不能養成獨立自主的思想能力，其一部分乃至隨人俯仰，受人玩弄，背棄求學的初衷，甘作政爭的工具，愛國憂時的人士，無不引爲痛心。要知道我中華民族自有歷史以來，雖屢受外來的侵略，而仍能屹立不動，巍然自存者，端賴民族信心能抗禦異族的侵凌，始終保持於不墮，國家危殆，猶能復興，而文化淪亡，將永無甦生的希望。所以學術思想的獨立，實爲今後文化建設的基本方針，願我全國文化界急起直追，共赴這一個崇高的　的。</p>
<p>社會方面　（三）在社會方面，必須實行勤儉·刻苦的生活，尤須發揮自立自强的志氣，要知道奢侈爲亡國之原，浪費爲建國之敵，當此世界大戰之後，並世各國無不竭其全力，獎勵生產，節約消費，以從事於戰後的復興，試看英國厲行節約，限制消費，何等流底。就是經濟力量集厚的美國，最近亦呼籲國民節减食品的消耗。其他新興諸國，更莫不刻苦砥囑，戮力自强，何况我們中國經如此長期的抗戰，又加以共匪的破壞，整個社會殘破瘡痍，國家民族恥辱深重，我們處在這樣艱苦的環境，如果仍舊泄沓因循，不知振作，或浪費無度，或惰怠偷安，那不僅戰後復興渺無希望，整個民族，勢將遭受淘汰，無以自存。我在這兩年以來，迭次警惕我同胞「戰後的艱苦必當倍蓰於抗戰之時」，今天更要鄭重勗勉我國全國同胞，務必痛澈省悟，知恥自强，革除奢侈，浪費，苟且，僥倖的惡習，一方面要節衣縮食，克苦耐勞，同時更要停靠自力，突破難關，這是我國建國的唯一道路，每一個同胞要爲國家盡責任，爲自己求生存，必須有向上的志氣，作刻苦的努力，更希望社會領導人士躬行實踐，儘量提倡，以造成建國的風尚，策進建國的成功。</p>
<p>同胞們，我們這個戡亂建國的重要關頭，必須認識，國家民族的安危，完全取決於我們今日的努力，我們在對內方面，必須建立民主法治的基礎，貫澈民生主義的設施，爭取學術思想的獨立，實行勤儉刻苦的生活，發揚知恥自强的志氣，而在對外方面，更必須秉持獨立自主的精神，和平合作的宗旨，以自立於國際風雲變幻之世界，纔能建設中國爲獨立統一與進步的現代國家，戡平共匪的叛亂，掃除建國的障碍，以告慰於創立民國的國父與革命先烈的英靈。（完）</p>

<h3>洛維特譴責新共產國際　蓄意破壞歐洲復興　　附和各國應自負一切責任</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓八日電〕美國代理國務卿洛維特今宣稱：由華沙會議最近所宣佈成立之　　共黨新聞局，其計劃若告成功，必可使歐洲經濟趨於崩潰。洛維特聲明全文如次：「蘇聯報紙所刊關於九個歐洲國家共產黨代表會議之資料，以及該會議在日爾格勒成立新聞局（包括各該國共產黨中央委員會代表）之決議，美國務院已予以嚴密之審查。同時，國務院並已發現若干國家之內閣負責閣員（蘇聯在內）均包括在各該代表之中。華沙會議大會宣言之詞句，要意誹謗英美人民在大戰中支目標，並曲解美國政策，其字句與各地共黨報紙論調，不謀而合。華沙會議所發表之文件，顯而易見，與此次計劃有關之政府與　，已表明決意　其　力，阻止歐洲經濟之復興。歐洲人民，凡自願相信此種惡意宣佈者，應自負其責。蓋華沙會議之觀念若存在，則歐洲經濟崩潰，必無法避免也。我人必須保持鎮靜及明白之判斷，萬勿　開我人之崗位，繼續以同情及冷靜之現實，審查歐洲如何方可重　共在和平與穩定世界中之地位。」</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓八日電〕洛維特宣稱：各國間對馬歇爾計劃之技術討論，甚有進展，在十日內將就其中若干方面發表聲明。目前各國技術委員會正在華府舉行會議，巴黎會議執行委員會委員（包括英代表弗蘭克及法代表　爾芬即將來此參加。論及美國對歐洲臨時援助問題，洛氏稱：政府決盡力在現有基金中取出最後之一元救濟歐洲。記者詢以美國對法是否已　得「充分之款項」，洛氏答謂業已　得之款項，並不充分　。渠希望比京會議對於德國所　得之金條，能儘早予以分配，果爾則法國可能充分之款項矣。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓八日電〕此間外交界人事對於洛維特聲明淼　有力，均　有淺刻印象。料此聲明系於與馬歇爾國務卿詳細研討　並　密研究與共黨此一行動有關之一切情　後所草成。洛氏並透露七日自莫斯科返美駐蘇大使史密斯，今日會向國務院報告，並即將前往紐約，與馬歇爾詳細檢討美蘇一般關係。</p>

<p>吾人別無他途可遁，吾人已開始動用黃金及美元準備金，此項準備金數量不大，且係供整個英鎊開用者，其他國家亦可面臨同一問題，將無從對其人民。英國向美貨款所餘之四億元苟能解凍，則頗可能使英國度過今美國對年，但以後發展，尚須視動用我準備金之程度而定。余不信英國對美輸出，得與美國對英輸出平衡。英國當以減少輸入，增產以擴大輸出為彌補其入超之方法。然對於美元區入超問題，仍無從解決，此乃控制整個世界經濟困難之問題，在獲得解決以前，吾人決不能脫離困難。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦九日電〕權威方面稱，本星期內英國又將以價值八千萬美元之黃金準備售與美國，以彌補其　縮小之美元。此為三星期來之第二次向美出售黃金準備。上次在九月十五日售出八千萬，目前政府所馀之黃金準備雖嚴守秘密，然　僅馀二十二億肆仟萬元。</p>

<h3>查賬索詐證實　起訴稅員十人　地檢處起訴書詳經過　劉潤先等三人在逃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕直接稅局職員高世傑，謝聯勛，余茂節，張寳平，楊仁政，鄒文龍，劉潤先，張文華，王宗槐，王仁堂等十人，前被本市木器商張中原等檢舉有貪汚嫌疑，經地檢處朱錫瑜檢察官偵査終結，昨以貪汚罪提起公訴。原起訴　略謂：「緣高世傑，謝聯勛，余茂節，張寳平，楊仁政，王仁堂，鄒文龍，暨在逃之劉潤先，張文華，王宗槐，均係財政部上海直接稅局査帳員。本年八月十五日，爲稽征卅六年度第一類營利事業所得稅，實施簡化稽征手續，規定每一同業公會其會員數額在二百家至四百家者，每百家抽查三家。本市中式木器商業同業公會所　會員凡二百五十餘家，應抽査者七家，由該局抽　主持人提出名單，共廿五家。嗣査得其中八家，並非該業會員，經聲明後予以剔除，故參加抽籤者，計十七家，結果中籤者七家，即張森茂號，朱根記號，五福號，楊隆興號，張萬利號，張萬泰號。同月十七日該局通知上開各該中籤商號，於十八日晨携帶賬簿至稅局候査，並由局方以抽籤方式派定張寳平，余茂節査核張森茂號賬簿，楊仁政，王宗槐査核楊　興號賬簿，王仁堂，張達儒査核張萬利號賬簿，劉潤先，張文華査核朱根記號賬簿，魏光宇，陳志傑査核喬源泰號賬簿，金瑞舟，李洋査核張萬泰號賬簿，高世傑，謝聯勛査核五福號賬簿。復因各該商號所備賬册，記載頗多乘誤，未合會計定則，査帳人員備加責難。當張森茂號經理張賢良與各該查帳員解釋之際，鄒文能聞聲趨出，得悉各該商號賬簿旣均有重大瑕疵，堪供指摘，遂思乘機索許。初詢張賢良有無本局職員相稔，容可情商。當由張賢良舉該局已離職人員鄭公達姓名，鄒首肯，旋命張先歸去，隨即與張寳平·余茂節·王仁堂·劉潤先·張文華·高世傑·謝聯勛·楊仁政等計議實施計則方式，經先向各該査帳商號分別警吿，謂須補稅，自七八千萬雹以迄一萬萬元不等，以資要挾，隨即减價索詐款項了事，幷約定在京華酒家作爲談判塲所。</p>
<p>約赴酒樓談判</p>
<p>同日下午五時，鄒文龍即以常話邀約張賢良前往京華酒家晚餐。張迫於情勢，遂約同楊隆興號主婦楊老關娘，朱根記號經理朱劍霓，張萬利統職負張中會，王詠　等前往。時鄒文龍·余茂節·王仁堂·張寶平·楊仁政·劉潤先·張文華，亦均先後到達，當由鄒余向張賢良聲稱，至少須繳付款項二千萬元。嗣由劉潤先從中斡旋，减至一千四百萬元，以半數繳納稅款，以半數充作所謂交際費。朱根記楊隆興二號亦同此辦理。張賢良等懾於脅迫，勉于允諸，惟對於張萬利號則堅持須付款二千九百萬元，致未獲結果而散。而五福號查帳員高世傑，謝聯勛，則另約該號經理曹才根至咖喱飯店，由謝索詐二千萬元，由高减至一千四百萬元而罷。嗣張賢良張巾會等以鄒索詐事寳返吿張中原（張萬利號主），張據以轉吿上海市參議會潘議長，參議員楊撫生等，及市商會秘書嚴　聲。翌日王仁堂復邀張萬利號職員沈文彬至淸華同學會午餐，沈遂會同張賢良前往，但對於張萬利號仍堅持索二千九百萬元。嗣後自動减至二千三百萬元。王仁堂當稱最遲於二十一日交款。</p>
<p>得款存儲銀行</p>

<h3>煤油亦漲價　此後遇有特殊情形隨時開會評議價格</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市物價評議會燃料小組，昨日下午三時，在社會局舉行第十次評議會，決定調整煤油議價，自本週起，每桶爲二百二十萬元（每桶五十三加倫，原爲一百四十四萬元）。零售每提六千元（每提一公升，原爲四千元）。</p>
<p>該會並決定自本週起，對於煤油議價採取機動方式。除每週四之例會外，遇有特殊情形，隨時召集開會評議價格。同業公會於每週例會時，必須具報一週來黑市價格情形，作爲議價之參考，俾使議價與黑市不致相差過遠。據評議會方面表示，煤油議價之所以採取機動性，係因政府不能似食糖煤　等之能控制，或供給原料，可採硬性管制手段。各種燃料有牽連關係，煤油實際供求不相平衡，無法硬性管制。</p>

<p>指揮兩次淞滬戰役</p>
<p>奏樂開會後，主席潘公展致辭，略謂：「今日上海農工學商各界羣聚一堂，實爲難得之盛會。回憶上海在一二八之役及八一三全面抗戰中，均居於重要之地位。而兩次戰役中，均由張將軍指揮領導，淞滬之役後，上海規定不設防，張將軍乃致力於上海外圍之佈置，因平時有備，故能於抗戰初期。予敵反擊，上海一地，終能支持三個月之光榮抗戰，奠定勝利之基礎，張氏運籌之功，實令人感念不已。回憶淞滬抗戰期內，上海市民全力供應，與軍士打成一片，此情此景，今日思之，歷歷如在目前。現共匪叛亂，阻撓國家復興，此日歡迎張將軍，實屬感慨萬端。</p>
<p>領導靑年特別努力</p>
<p>至於蔣經國光生，則其在國外之硏究及返國後之服務精神，均可欽佩。特別建設「新贛南」，以身作則，樹立新風氣，尤屬盡人皆知。今日人人談改革政治社會風氣，除蔣主席在上領導外，尤須地方幹部共同努力，蔣氏贛南之政績，堪爲地方政治之模範。此外，蔣氏對靑年之領導，特別努力，且具有興趣。今蔣氏已任職中樞，當能引導靑年在正確方針之下，造成有新氣象所抱負之幹部，担任二期革命之任務，國家之希望實緊於此。上海一百萬靑年，均有報國之志，故對蔣氏有深切期望。本市黨團合併，蔣氏奉命來滬指導，行見兩個有共同信仰，共同歷史，共同領導者之革命團體，合而爲一，以完成建國之任務。」</p>
<p>修正改善一般風氣</p>
<p>主席　畢，張治中將軍於熱烈掌聲中被邀演說首先對上海各界表示謝意，並謂：「昔人有言，爭名於朝，爭利於市」，上海人忙得不可開交，爲的是利，凡屬工商業之國家，不諱言利，上海無疑是一大商塲，謀利乃當然之事。但所謀之「利」，應利於大衆，利於勞苦大衆，更需有利於國家民族，方爲眞正與合法的利。抵禦一種「思潮」之侵入，各先進國家各有一套辦法，我國所恃者爲民生主義及現代社會政策。本人抵滬後，到過戲院，咖啡室，舞廳，亦曾因憑　淞滬戰役無名英雄墓，目擊鄕民之生活，深感上海人生活方式之距離，應予縮短，或根本取消此種距離。上海必需隨歷史之巨　前進，各界領袖能引導人民，修正並改善一般風氣，則對國家前途，有很大貢獻」。</p>
<p>呼籲開發建設西北</p>
<p>張氏繼代西北呼籲，謂與東南，柬北，西南比較，西北各省最無基礎，人民生活較東南幾落後一世紀，希望上海工商界及全國工商界能分出一部份力量，開發西北，建設西北。張氏辭畢，　請蔣經國致辭，詞甚簡短、謙種對國家無功績，無資格被歡迎，今日實與上海各界共同歡迎張治　將軍。惟各界之厚意盛情，將愈益　　本人努力服務。最後由方治演說，盛贊張蔣兩　功績，至五時三刻，盛會始終於軍樂聲中結束。</p>

<h3>兩小型機歷險抵滬　浙海上空遇暴風　電訊斷絕幾迷路</h3>

<h3>山東戰塲　從軍事勝利到政治競賽　兩件大事</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南五日航訊〕近半月來，山東戰塲發生了兩件大事：一件是國軍於本月一日上午九時半正式收復烟台，另一件是陳毅殘餘主力因不堪國軍壓迫，不得不放棄其慘淡經營二十年的山東根據地南竄豫皖蘇邊區。</p>
<p>烟台在共匪戰略上所佔的重要地位，盡人皆知，它是山東共匪與東北共匪的交通孔道，山東的壯丁糧食，東北的武器彈藥，主要的全從這裏輸運。烟台的收復，無疑的是共匪全盤戰略的失敗，與則抗戰結束的來國家統一建設致命危機的消除，其意義的重大，遠超過國內過去任何戰役，甚至是延安戰役。</p>
<p>作爲「山東軍區司令」的陳毅，當然也早就着到這一點，因此，在九月二十日前後，他首先就集中於九月初由警中北竄黃河尙米補訓成熟的兩個縱隊（後來增加至四個），會同原據魯西南的五個縱隊殘餘，再度大舉反攻濟寗城，企圖於攻佔該城後再向東北同竄沂蒙山區以牽制進攻烟台國軍之後側，但這首先遭過了國軍邱淸泉及吳化文兩部的迎頭痛擊，匪軍於損失萬餘後，不得不改變計劃，於二十五，廿六兩日分由曹縣越隴海綫南竄。</p>
<p>豫皖蘇邊區</p>
<p>其中西竄的一股雖已與劉伯誠合流，但其企圖確保烟台，牽制國軍與重入沂蒙山區的計劃，顯已全盤失敗。</p>
<p>截至記者寫本文時爲止，由陳毅指揮業已擴編成十四個縱隊，（其中計包括第一至第十三縱隊缺第五縱隊快速縱隊及兩廣縱隊）的華東野戰軍，其中除掉比較像樣的七個縱隊已隨陳匪離魯南竄外，另外在山東境内，尙殘留有七個蹤隊的番號。此七個縱隊中，一個兩廣縱隊，原駐魯北之惠民，近已移駐津浦北段之德縣，另四個縱隊被國軍包圍于昌邑，岞山，亭口間的狹長地區，另兩個縱隊在魯西南掩護陳毅主力南竄後，已被國軍壓迫得北竄至宋江老巢梁山寨，這七個縱隊的總兵力，共計已僅有五萬人。（按：陳匪編制每縱隊之兵力應爲二萬五千至三萬人。）此外。</p>
<p>共匪在魯境</p>
<p>的地方團隊，據最近調査：　黃河北岸：計壽張駐一萬人，阿城一獨立旅，聊城一千，荏平三千，齊河荏平間二團，齋河禹城間二團，惠民二千，魯東北堤子口三千，原爲魯北共匪補給中心之惠民所有各項後勤設備近已開始他撤。　魯中：計秦安萊蕪間一千，徂徠山二千，大汶口東一千，萊蕪東南三團，溜川東大和莊一團。蔣峪西二團安邱西南秦戈莊一團，安邱東南景芝一國。　魯南：計費縣，向城間潛伏張光中部三個師的殘餘。　膠濟路北及膠東：計章邱東五百，博興，桓台商一千·桓台東南一團，廣饒南一千，廣饒東北二團，昌邑北二團，平度南八千，掖縣東北朱橋鎭一旅，古峴東二團，萊陽東一師，鋸齒牙山一旅二團，海陽，威海衛各二千，文登七千。</p>
<p>以上魯共地方團隊總計爲四個殘破師，三個旅，廿一個團，另四四五〇〇人，如以每團作千人，殘破的旅師作五千人計，合共約十萬人，這個數目如再加上七個殘餘縱隊的兵力，共僅十五萬人，因此這與本年年初號稱四十三萬正規軍，一一三個獨立團（即民兵）的情形比起來，今後的山東，勢將進入綏靖作戰階段，而欲求綏靖使命的順利究成，</p>
<p>主要的關鍵</p>
<p>自然不在軍事而在政治競賽的加堅！</p>
<p>當本文與讀者相見時，黃河以南的魯境部份，很可能迎僅餘的三縣，（海陽，文登，榮成）一市，（威海衛）亦已入國軍之手。黃河北岸的魯北部份，由於地勢平坦，極目千里，正是國軍機械化部隊運動馳騁的理想戰塲，再加以在共匪目下所施行的「空心戰術」下，魯北共匪的兵力，總共只是一個縱隊的正規業及地方部隊一旅四團與民兵一萬九千人，因此，國軍於膠東戰事吿一段落後，不僅隨時可以光復魯北，並可隨時打通津浦北段，當前問題的焦點是在國軍目前的戰略仍不在一城一地的得失，或一條鐵路的打通，而主要的仍在集中優勢兵力捕捉共匪主力，進行決戰，予以殲滅性打擊！（特派員　天）</p>

<h3>荒地拓成茶田　增產途中的台茶</h3>
<p>〔本報台北四日訊〕台灣的特產之一——茶，是晨林四大公司中較有希望的唯一產品，這是決定於國際市塲外匯價格的調整和茶葉公司內在的努力。</p>
<p>台茶不是高級茶，但紅茶因爲品種好，色澤濃，在外銷美國可得美金四角五分一斤。佔據買入的百分之三十。烏龍茶因爲台灣沒有派駐美國的專門負責人負改裝小包交三個家飯館推銷，所以市堪顯得呆滯，茶業公司連去年的存貨擱有二百多萬磅，尙沒有主顧，這梯迫使製茶工業走上純製紅茶之路。</p>
<p>全省茶園</p>
<p>過去有四萬五千甲（每甲約等十四畝餘），現在有三萬八千甲，日人時代最高生產紀錄是二千五百萬磅。而省營茶業公司所擁有的茶園，祇三千甲，其中兩千四百甲已吿復興，還有六百甲，尙待開墾，去年生產一百萬磅，本年正增至約二百萬磅，（全省茶產去年六有萬磅，公司六分之一，本年產一千萬磅，公司佔五分之一，）這說明了台茶民營方面佔有絕對的優勢，政府非但未圖控制，同時却以貸款施肥等實惠的辦法來扶持它，將荒地拓成茶國。</p>
<p>台茶公司</p>
<p>有六個茶塲包括十個粗製廠，三個精製廠，是日本財閥三井在台灣的遺產。日本人對付茶農運用了政治的壓力，圈定某一個山嶺或平原强迫某一個茶農負責，茶農是資方所雇用的苦工，受資方的支配剝削，生活是痛苦的。光復以後該公司改變了經營方式，以全部茶園，交給茶農，委託和帮助它墾殖，施肥，再以三十五元一斤的最低價向其收購，同是五年，公　每年收取次　的茶斤，實際上還不敷公司繳納田賦的數額，可是茶農却須將生棄交購公司，這明是虧蝕的、但直接却鼓勵了茶農積極增產。</p>
<p>四日記者專車赴中部三又地方，參觀了茶葉製造塲，還直接訪問了茶農。據沈塲長吿訴記者：該塲去年生產三十萬磅，今年却增加到九十萬磅，祇要　　　茶園擴大</p>
<p>肥料解決，一二年內可以突破日人一百三十萬磅的紀錄。在南部純亞熱帶味的鄕村裏，記者於訪問種十五甲茶的茶晨會進芳時，他也說，現在這有希望擴充茶園，使全村一百三十餘戶半數以上能事有承稱茶田的權利。（目前僅是限於日人時代的老茶農），茶農，台灣茶業公司的茶農是幸福的，只要給予實惠，莫不願以血汗來嗅取茶葉的香味。無怪爪哇茶業專家來台考察時，也盛　此項辦法。</p>
<p>茶業公司總經理陳爲楨是刻苦　　業硏究家，他說國有民營的種茶辦法是可以達到增產目的。公司現在將盡力於增產，同時請專家作專題硏究，與內地各茶塲交換技衛實習。陪同記者們參觀的，還有參加諸　會議和米蘇里艦投降典禮的楊宣誠海軍中將，現任省府顧問，今後他將以全力為台省的農林勞力。（特派員江　　）</p>

<h3>太太你知道如何用奶粉哺乳嗎？</h3>
<p>— 蘇曾祥</p>
<p>爲了天性的愛與自己的責任，一個嬰兒生出後，他的母親，應當自己哺乳，至少五個月或三個月或少至二星期，因爲母乳適合嬰兒，體質，母乳淸潔，易消化，富於滋養，且能抵抗疾病，這是許多學者所公認的事情。不必我來多說。</p>
<p>但是世有萬不得已的事情，如母親有嚴重的疾病，或乳汁實在缺乏而又難覓良好的乳母時，祇有用人工營養了。</p>
<p>人工營養，用之得法，成績亦非常良好，於其人乳不够　哺而致面黃肌瘦時，反不若牛乳或奶粉之爲妙。</p>
<p>許多人間我奶粉如何冲法？太太！我來吿訴你，每一湯匙奶粉，加二兩開水（約六十西西），用力調勻之，適合成新鮮牛奶的成份，這是原質，你要記住！還有聽頭牛奶（不是錬乳，錬乳不好的），即英文名Evaporated　Milk取一份奶，和同量之水（即各半），亦即合成一新鮮牛奶，照這原質，不論你用新鮮的牛奶或調成的奶粉或聽頭牛奶，都能得到同樣的功效。。</p>
<p>現在我們來講講用量，要知道用量，必先知道嬰兒的體重，自初生後，一直至五公斤之嬰兒（即五公斤以內之嬰兒），他每日所需之實際奶量，（即純奶量），適得他體重十分之一，五公斤以外之嬰兒，他每日所需之實際奶量，亦合他體重十分之一，不過五公斤以內之嬰兒之牛奶，用相等之最稀薄粥湯冲淡之，（亦可稱　之奶奶），五公斤以外之嬰兒之牛奶，用三分之一之最稀薄之粥湯冲淡餵之（亦可稱　之奶奶）</p>
<p>醫如今有三公斤之嬰兒（三公斤即三千克，合六。六磅）每日需要純牛奶量，　為三百克（約十兩强），再加三百克之最稀薄粥湯，和而餵之，從這六百克之總數中每日平分五至六次餵哺。</p>
<p>譬如今有六公斤之嬰兒（六公斤即六千克合十三。三磅）奶量仍　即六百克。但此時所加之薄粥湯，祇須合奶量中之　即二百克，（即上面所稱　奶奶）六百加二百共八百克（即八百西西）此時嬰兒漸長，不可僅飲牛奶，故每日餵乳，只須四次，每次二百西西，（合六兩半至七兩之間）但每日除乳汁外，必須給以較厚的東西，使營養充足，而胃部不致因僅飲流質而過分漲大，這東西名糊樣食物，初時每日一次，以六兩奶加一湯匙麥粉Cream　of　wheat）或二湯匙Pabeum（洋什南貨店有售）此時小孩約三個半月。</p>
<p>四個月後，每日一次菜泥，一次糊樣食物，三次奶，菜泥或其他泥（泥即糊樣食物），每次可給一小碗，（二百克），奶則每次六七兩之間，不可再多，一直至六個月爲止。</p>
<p>六個月以後，健康之小孩，可吃純奶，（即不加水及粥湯之新鮮牛奶，或一湯匙冲二兩開水之奶粉，均屬純奶，上面已說過）。並逐漸將哺乳之頓數减少，而代以較厚之糊樣食物，以至週歲。</p>
<p>糖有熟量，且亦含　粉質，用之適量，能增加體重，通順大便舊習慣中，以爲糖能生痰，未免錯誤，普通奶中應加之糖，約得５％（百分之五）譬如每一兩半奶，一兩半薄粥湯，共三兩，須加白糖一茶匙，（一茶匙合五克），以此類推。僅於腹瀉或大便過薄時，糖可酌減。</p>
<p>我國老式奶糕，未嘗不可用，惟太片面營養，不足够，若煮時能再加二三匙奶粉，一同調入，何嘗不可成爲有滋養之食物。</p>
<p>此外每日除飮乳外，復給以開水少許，（從初生時起），滿一個月之嬰兒，可以吃橘子汁，素菜湯等，以增維他命C，滿二個月之嬰兒，宜給以魚肝油，以防軟骨病。</p>
<p>最近美國大學敎授經硏究之發現，嬰兒生後滿二星期，即可餵以肉類之汁，於嬰兒發育極有助，蓋嬰兒營養，必須從多方面着想，我國有一歲以外之嬰兒，而仍僅吃奶奶者，當知改進矣。</p>
<p>年靑的太太們！爲國家民族前途着想，爲你自己的幸福快樂着想，希望你得個健康活潑之嬰兒，筆者要使你明白起見，不厭求詳的反覆寫着，想你不會說，我嚕　吧？</p>
<h3>傷寒病人的預後和看護</h3>
<p>— 謝筠壽</p>
<p>（續前）　原來有心臟病，肺臟病（結核，肺炎）糖尿病，腎臟炎等的時候，預後多惡劣。</p>
<p>早發褥瘡，脈搏瀕數，白血球特別减少的時候也危險。</p>
<p>死亡率，講到傷寒病人的死亡率，和環境很有關係，最重要的，就是地方上衛生的設備，如果有善良的自來水和設備完善的下水汚物排除法，傷寒病人自然减少得多。德國拍林在一八五六年雖則有了上水道（就是自來水），但是沒有下水道設備，傷寒的死亡數，不見减少。等到一八七五年下水道工程開始，死亡率就逐漸降低，原來十萬人口有八〇——八五的死亡者，等到一八七五——八七九年降低至四二，到一九〇〇——一九〇二年僅僅只有四名。第二貧富也有關係，羅氏（Rosemfeld）在維也納的調查富民區的死亡率爲十六，五——十九。七四%；貧民區就有二四。六——二二。一九%</p>
<p>傷寒病人的看護</p>
<p>傷寒病人的看護，正和醫師一樣的重要，如果看護一不週到的話，往往會引起重大的後果，所以也有人謂傷寒病人的看護，有時比醫師還重要，因爲傷寒病目下還沒有特效藥，需戰戰兢兢的安然渡過這悠悠的一月或二月的危險時期，是不容易的，現在也逐條的寫在下面：</p>
<p>安靜心身的安靜，對傷寒病人，是一個重要的條件，床上安臥，不但可以澦防腸穿孔和腸出血，還有因爲傷寒病人長期發熱以後，心臟衰弱，行動是很危險的。筆者上月遇到了這樣的一件事，就是一個十四歲的男孩，患了傷寒病，熱度並不甚高，家族裘因之不甚注意，在第二週末，出去到醫師那裏就診，把他抱起來，病人覺到不勝任，瞬息之間，面色慘白，呼吸和脈搏，即刻停止，等到請筆者去的時候，病人早已一命嗚呼，這是什麼綠故呢？就是因爲心臟衰弱急性麻痺的關係。還有一種熱已退盡，因急速起坐，引起心臟麻痺而死亡的，所以傷寒病人的飲食大小便等，都應當在床上舉行，不可行動。</p>
<p>飮食傷寒病人的病變，是在小腸，所以飲食應當特別注意，但是吾國習俗，對於傷寒病人，過度的限止飮食，有「餓不煞的傷寒」的俗語，這也是不合理的。因爲病人長期的發熱，體內營養品消耗特多，如果不補充的話，使病人營養不足，恢復延遲。從來對於固形食物，十分警戒，實則食餌達到空腸的時候，已經變成乳糜狀，沒有刺戟的作用，有人實臉在傷寒病熱發的時候，用固形食物，也不見到再發和腸出血的增加。所以吾人對於傷寒病人的食餌，雖不必提倡固形食物，免遭意外，但是充分的補充，是不可忘的。最好在有熱的時候，應當選擇容易消化的食物和避去刺戟腸部的食物，隨各人的嗜好，加以調製，有熱期間，用些米湯，藕粉，魚類，雞卵和馬鈴薯，蘿卜等煮後的厚湯，等到熱度退盡的時候，逐漸調換其他的食物。</p>
<p>預防褥瘡，因爲長臥的關係，病人很容易發生褥瘡，所以被褥應當平坦，不可有皺　，重症病人臥空氣床或永床，頭部用氷囊或氷枕。傷寒病人雖以仰臥爲宜，但爲防避褥瘡，可常常用側臥位，易受壓迫部份的皮膚，用氣墊或酒精淸拭。</p>
<p>口腔應當淸潔，一日三次用硼酸水洗滌或嗽口，以預防中耳炎和耳下腺炙。口唇乾燥一％硼酸蜂蜜或硼酸甘油塗布。</p>
<p>頭髮及皮膚，指爪等均應淸潔。國人往往對於病人的淸潔，容易忽略，這是重大的錯誤，因爲病人的排洩物，遠較常人爲多。</p>
<p>熱退後二週，方可起坐，如果覺到眩暈或不快的時候，就應當禁止，隨後逐步起立步行。</p>
<p>對於精神感動，訪客長談，讀書等，也應禁止。</p>
<p>恢復期中也應十分靜養，再從事於職業，否則早期工作，有陷於強度神經衰弱的危險。</p>
<p>病人維他命甲乙丙三種的補充，當然也是需要的。（續完）</p>
<h3>學校衛生之要點（一）</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>兒童身體的健康，首重家庭及學校衛生。而今日之敎育家，對於學校衛生之設施，大都缺乏重視觀念。殊不知兒童在成長時期，其衛生基礎未能鞏固，甚有影響於將來身體之健康。學校衛生應注意之重要點不外　校內衛生設備之完全，尤以校舍淸潔入學兒童身體之淸潔及學校內外環境之保持整潔。一校內必須設置休養室，醫務室，空氣浴，露天敎室，撩養家，淋浴室，溫浴室等。　敎材上必須有衛生知識之灌輸及衛生　　之養成法。　體育敎材之實施時，必須注意兒童身體強弱之程度，而施以相當之敎材。體弱者切不可勉為其難而令練習劇烈運動。　學校與家庭之衛生的連絡，對於體弱者尤宜密切。凡施行健康檢查之結果有無應矯正之缺點，務須通知其家長或保護人。尤於營養，睡眠，休息，家庭工作，平素疾病等最應特別互通消息。　對於虛弱兒童務行日光浴，空氣浴，淋浴及溫浴等。　應用紫外光綫之治療如人工太陽燈之照射。　魚肝油及其製劑（維他命丸劑滴劑）之應用於虛弱兒童，於身體之營養效果極大。</p>
<p>（甲）日光浴</p>
<p>日光浴對於虛弱兒童之養護，爲最重要之設施。校內須設備特別之日光浴室。若簡陋之學校或限於經濟者，至少亦宜設置簡單之日光浴場如屋頂操塲等處，張園幕以防風，地上敷白布，身體上有些部分須避烈日之直射者，則備有黑布備用。日光不宜通過玻璃，因玻璃可以吸收日光中之紫外光綫使日光浴减少效能。故宜選太陽直射之廣場爲上策。而施行日光浴之原則：　宜直射光綫而裸露體表。　宜完全利用日光，勿使無形阻隔。　宜逐漸進行，不可一時行全身照射。</p>
<p>（乙）人工太陽燈之照射</p>
<p>日光浴之效果，在乎日光中之紫外光綫之效能。然日光浴有時因氣候及季節而不能施行者，則宜將虛弱兒童由校方負責人與設備完善之大醫院約定每星期送去施行人工太陽燈之照射，其效能亦與日光浴同。施行方法概相同。</p>
<p>（丙）魚肝油及其製劑之服用</p>
<p>學校中須規定每星期配給魚肝油或維他命滴劑與身體虛弱之兒童。由醫師證明向公家領取，敎導其家長，如何服用方法。此對於貧血，腺病，　齒及全身發育不良及體質虛弱等之改善，甚有卓效。實為未可輕視之營養強壯性食品也。但配給之手續不宜麻煩以免兒童畏能放棄。故須視地方情形而定之。</p>
<h3>DDT　與囚犯衛生</h3>
<p>— 胡起鵬</p>
<p>DDT殺虫的功效，兩年以來，經文字宜傳，大衆採用，已經是盡人皆知.對于八類切身有害的虫：如蠅，蚊，蚤，虱，臭虫等，其功效尤爲顯著。因此可以防止由於這些虫做媒的傳染病：如同霍亂，瘧疾，傷寒，斑疹傷寒，回歸熱等。換言之，DDT倘若使用得法人類就可以减少許多傳染病的威脅。同時也救得許多在牢監裏關着，於刑法上不必判死刑而寃枉病死的囚犯。這就是本文所要講的。</p>
<p>囚犯本來是爲一般社會人士所不足齒數，以爲對囚犯何必講什麼衛生，即使坐牢病死，也是咎由自取，死不足羿。要知這是人類錯誤思想，太殘忍的劣性。所以自十九世紀以還的刑法，由死刑與身體刑逐步轉變爲自由刑。意思是一個人犯了罪，祇要剝奪其自由權，不得傷害其生命。先進各國，因此重視監獄衛生的改善，增進囚犯待遇。最近蘇聯將宣佈廢止死刑，也就是更進一步。</p>

<h3>辛亥西北革命史詩</h3>
<p>— 張立卿</p>
<p>記「消防駐在所」之讖</p>
<p>議語成　又似謠，果然所在駐防消；刧餘鐘鼓千年久，塗抹殘紅比「麗譙」。</p>
<p>西安市鐘鼓兩樓，位居中央，偉大建築，千年前遺留物也。辛表光復軍興之前，警察當局成立「消防隊」，隊部設鼓樓上，懸一牌日：「消防駐在所」，井故同志勿幕戲謂余等曰：「此五字試倒讀之，則成「所在駐防消」。」軍興後西安滿人之駐防者，消滅無遺，適成語讖；此後居民咸知之，轉成謠矣。此余等目覩之事實。不知當時何故少　一「隊」字，若有隊字，則倒讀不成話矣。樓上有「文武盛地」「聳聞於天」等　額，字均大逾丈餘。民十六年某氏執政，「鐘鼓樓」均髹爲「紅」色，前明「秦王宮城」，舊稱「皇城」，亦改稱「紅城」。愼乎造因！</p>
<p>山西景梅九老同志亦有詩記此事，詩曰：星十丈幻童謠，未至重陽風雨潮（陝西九月朔日舉義）；漫讀廻文成巧讖，居然所在駐防消。</p>
<p>原注：長安設「消防駐在所」勿幕謂余曰：可倒讀爲「所在駐防消」，光復時竟騐。同盟光復舊山河，萬戶長安</p>
<p>辛亥九月朔陜西革命軍興</p>
<p>同盟光復舊山河，萬戶長安齊凱歌；　福寺前密會後，偕行慷慨一時多！</p>
<p>陝西於辛該九月朔日舉義旗，爲　應武漢首義之第一起。山西則九月初八，其他各省市則又在山西以後。撫今憶昔，痛定思痛，何莫非諸先烈之頭顱熱血易來，能不猛省！</p>
<p>陝西之舉義，其力量全在新軍中諸同志；其策畫與主義乃吾同盟會諸同志所主張，灌輸於數年前。爲吾陝同盟會諸同志師者，乃朱佛光先師，灌輸革命思想於庚子以後，先生主講　院，以「周易」之革卦「湯武革命」，「公羊傳」之「復　」「三世」之說，大戴禮之「禮運大同」一章，孟子之「民爲貴」一節等反復講述，鼓吹革命排滿，爭取民權，可謂先覺先知。留日加入中國同盟會，歸陝實行革命者，皆先生之學生。謂先生爲西北革命種子之傳播者，誠信史也。</p>
<p>同盟會人物，皆光明磊落赤誠潔白，祗知義務；光復以後，解甲歸田，初無所謂「利誘」與「利用」也。後之人士其鑒諸！</p>
<p>西安淸行宮</p>
<p>西幸回鑾幾播遷，秦人猶記兩宮顏；十年轉瞬滄桑改，革命花紅萬壽山。</p>
<p>淸光緒庚子拳匪亂作，慈禧后倉皇偕德宗北狩，復赴晋之陜，暫以前總督署作行宮。翌年辛丑和議成回鑾，行宮則封閉不敢啓居。辛亥革命軍興，先以東木頭市之軍裝局權爲總司令部，旋即遷入行宮辦公。居民習呼日「北院」，以別於巡撫署之「南院」也。辛丑至辛亥，恰爲十年，北院之　桑如此，故特記之。</p>
<p>僥倖一丸太摸校，幹臣終始擅才能；「新華門」裏三朝老，「政事堂」中錢右承。</p>
<p>辛亥時陝藩司兼護巡撫者，爲錢能訓，九月初二日革命軍攻入撫署，錢舉手槍自殺，未中要害，即出人護之出境。袁氏　竊，改國務院爲政事堂，以徐世昌爲國務卿，錢爲「右丞」。民七，徐被安福系擁戴爲總統，徐又以錢爲國務總理，可謂新華門中之三朝元老</p>
<p>吊諸先烈兼懷諸同志</p>
<p>辛壬年間共苦辛，十人今尙幾人存？餘生深悔愉生累，九域澄淸再招魂。</p>
<p>宿草高低墳，多少英雄幾輩聞；四十年來無數刧，長安碩果張將軍。</p>
<p>張翔初印鳳　，長安人，陝西辛亥光復首領，士官騎科畢業。今猶健在。住西安菊花圓。（書尙未刋，禁轉載）</p>

<h3>辛亥革命之翻譯小說多少頭顱辛亥革命文獻展覽會介紹</h3>
<p>辛該革命犧牲了多少頭顱？答曰；「無人能計其數」。革命之精神在能犧牲自己頭顱，爲全民族而保全其頭顱。辛亥革命時期之白話翻譯小說「多少頭顱」作者起筆日：『話說歐州有一個大國名呌波蘭』。內容係記波蘭亡國之慘史，當時取裁翻譯之文藝小說出之於白話體，誠革命文學中之拱璧也。書中尙有『亡國將臨，還是吃酒的吃酒，彈唱的彈唱。傷心，傷心！普天下仁人同志，同聲一哭」等語。作者署名「亡國遺民之一」，光緒三十年鏡今書局出版，有胡滅明題詩云：</p>
<p>禍水滔天氣蘭姍，即今城國也荒殘；歲寒生有喬松老，泉下先靈血淚斑。</p>
<p>銅馬黃巢劇可憐，傷心種祀數呼天；莫將人我等閒視，細看扶桑在那邊。</p>
<p>五六年長帝祚終，民心恰似水流東；無情碧落太蒼莽，篝火城頭一片紅。</p>
<p>生民奚事墮悲　，山北山南莫不春；朝哭爺娘暮　子，三更夜月總驚心。</p>
<p>血脈而今付刧灰，豺狼虎豹一齊來；從今奄奄無生趣，囹圍遺民痛夜　。</p>

<p>我剪熄了自己的燈，瞪着眼盯着窗口。我好像觸到了窗有一種秘密。外面，雨小些了。而簷雨的調子却更加悽苦……</p>
<p>簷雨在輕輕地低唱；</p>
<p>有歌的地方就不會有寂寞；有燈的地方就不會有黑暗；有花的地方就不會有　惡；</p>
<p>嘴唇</p>
<p>孩子，你的嘴唇是一朶攻瑰，紅色的</p>
<p>而我的，却是從遙遠的地方飄泊來的兩張憔悴的葉子。還有什麼比玫瑰更美麗的呢？你的嘴唇是那麼紅潤而軟嫰；在唇裏邊，你更有着一排白得浸人的牙齒，一片紅得醉人的舌頭。孩子，請你好地珍惜着你的嘴唇吧！爲了你，爲了更多的人。</p>
<p>知道嗎，有嘴唇，就有歌；有歌，就不會有寂寞了。</p>
<p>眼睛</p>
<p>你喜歡看別人的眼睛嗎？</p>
<p>而你的眼淚先就要湧出來了。</p>
<p>記着，熟情會殺死你的靑春，熱情會損傷你的理智的啊。</p>
<p>我不會哭。我的眼睛是兩只塵封的破燈盤。</p>
<p>埋葬於破燈盤的往事的死燼是不能讓你發掘的。</p>
<p>孩子，祝福你，你的眼睛是閃着熊熊的火焰的燈。</p>
<p>有着閃着熊熊的火熖的燈是最幸福的。是可以馳行於夜路的。</p>
<p>孩子，請你好地珍惜着你的眼睛吧！爲了你；爲了更多的人。不是麽我們的寥闊而陰冷的土地是急切需要着燈亮呀！</p>
<p>靑春</p>
<p>你愛花麼？你愛開在春的綠原上的花麼？</p>
<p>我還愛太陽呢。</p>
<p>除了太陽，沒有另一朶永開不謝的花了。</p>
<p>靑春是最貴的花朶。</p>
<p>但靑春的生命太短了，還在太陽沒有紅得成熟的時候，牠就跟冷冷的朝露一樣，跌落在泥土裏去啦。</p>
<p>跌落在泥土裏去的花朶是不會有復活可能的。</p>
<p>而靑春也沒有種子。</p>
<p>孩子，請你好好地珍惜着你的靑春吧！爲了你，爲了更多的人。</p>
<p>吿訴你，這一片荒寒的田野是應該裝飾一些花朶了。</p>

<h3>臨南田秋水征帆圖</h3>
<p>— 顧若波</p>
<p>顧潑，吳縣人，字若波，工山水，兼四王吳惲諸家之長，淸麗蕭疏，氣韻秀出。是幀疏柳遊艇，秋波明凈，其胸次筆端，相去惲氏不遠也。若波生於道光己未，卒於光緒丙申，事壽六十有二。（陳倚石識）</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>這倒是一個辦法，更不失爲一個光明磊落的英雄。無奈耀羣這時處境，有一個特殊困難。她同小老虎另有使命，而且這個使命十二分重要。這次在天津躭擱下來，是偶然的事情，不過打算順便看看當地情形，並無任務。所以說，她如在這裏捲人了漩渦，幹得好，照公事說，僅僅是個「越職多事」四字的考語，萬一把自己都陷了下去，米免要落個任性使氣，兒戲公務的罪名。本來公家職務，各有定軌，不能越權攪事；並不能像小說裏的俠客一樣，想到什麼便幹什麼。她最多，也只能把親眼看見的做一份報吿，這已經就算多事了。</p>
<p>再說耀羣對於對方的底子，雖說從旅舍招待那裏聽了一點梗概，却如招待說的「有些　不淸」。換句話，對方仍就藏在暗陬，不知是個什麼路數，自己却是完全顯露，毫無掩護；知己而不知彼，已落下風，如要爭鬥起來，十有九敗，只有一分繳倖的道路可走。但是耀羣絕對不能貪圖這一分的徼倖。</p>
<p>「敝人是個老實人。」那傢伏看見說了一篇話，發了幾個問句，耀羣並沒接腔，而且神色非常寗靜；只有那變翠眉峯尖，稍稍顰起一些，表示對於它的出場，書語，和幾個問子，只是感覺新奇，有趣；好像一個觀客，正在欣賞舞臺上的小丑，表演拿手節目；又像無意發現了一個眞的希希哈哈一隻喜鵲，兩個腦袋——而且沒有澦備開口的表示，始終在洗耳恭聽，並且願意聰下去似的；所以它找補了這麼一句自我宣傳「老實人」，却又覺得這句話，說得太無氣力，便又提起了精神：</p>
<p>「紀小姐，也許您認爲敝人有些冒失，敝人確也承認有些冒失。萬是機會有限，時間不許可，敝人也只好冒失一下，眞對不起；像紀小姐長得這麽漂亮，氣派這麽堂　，當然不會計較這些小事。…再說，您二位一下軍，敝人早就注意了：」</p>
<p>耀羣聽到這裏，忽然　出手絹，雙手握在口鼻上，扭過身去打了一個大噴啑，却又立時恢復原狀，靜靜地聽着。</p>
<p>「…兩節客車，一百五六十位男女老幼，只您二位的通仃文件，是日本軍部簽發的。敝人當時就斷定了兩點：要不是『滿洲國」一班什麼大人老爺的小姐少爺；必是關內那此新貴的家屬。可是再一仔細觀察您二位的行動，敝人自己馬上把這兩點又推翻了。什麼理由？簡單得很：您二位如是這兩種人之一，決定不會不搗弄些勢派，舖張—帶兩個媽十或二爺，來個汽車接送。就曰這裏是半路下軍，像您二位這麼年靑，不是鬧得手忙脚亂，定是要大爺脾氣，烏烟癔氣一擺關，早呌小包車，直跑北平，還肯這麼節省，鎭定？……</p>

<h3>國魂復蘇——寫於三十六年雙十節——</h3>
<p>— 蕭亢石</p>
<p>明季之未，吳三桂爲了玉峯歌妓陳圓圓，在「慟哭六軍俱縞素，衝冠一怒爲紅顏」之下，　淸兵入關，就此把大好江山，給異族佔據了三百年。</p>
<p>在淸季的三百年中，其間雖有許多志士謀恢復「明社」，無奈人心不齊，屢這挫折消減。迨至孫總理「倡導革命」，相繼在萍鄉　陵發動，及潮州惠州起事。由欽廉而進取兩粵，敗退十萬大山。又與黃興等製取鎭南關，戰七晝夜而敗入安南。迨至民國紀元前五年，又改謀滇邊，命黃明堂襲取河口，復因無人指揮而失敗。民國前二年，黃興胡漢民等又謀以廣州新軍舉事而再失敗。翌年辛亥三月廿九日，黃興又集同志在廣州起義，攻督署，是爲黃花崗之役。總計先後各地起義，不下數十次，歷時亡十年，均失敗，而同志之遭淸廷殺戮者，有秋瑾唐才常，及黃花崗烈士等，非史册所能罄記。</p>
<p>會辛亥之歲，淸廷收全國民有鐵路爲國有，四川紳商，請總督代矣收回成命未果，被官署拘捕槍殺，激動民憤，淸廷乃派大員入川查辦，並率湖北新軍前往，當時之新軍，多爲革命黨人，因密謀露洩，死數十人，乃於十月十日，在武昌之工程營首先起事，佔領軍械局，輜重營在城外亦斬關而入，會攻督署，而馬隊砲隊亦相率以來，共推新軍協統黎元洪爲鄂軍都督，湯元龍爲民政長，稱「中華民國軍政府」。</p>
<p>黎氏隨即派兵渡江，佔領漢口漢陽，而各國領事團聲言獨立淸廷方始震驚，起用袁世覬爲湖廣總督，攻下漢口漢陽，而砲轟武昌，形勢轉危，幸湖南已吿獨立，黃興回國率兩湖民軍奮戰，各省相繼響應，海軍亦吿反淸，上海反南京亦爲革命軍克復，淸廷乃遺使講和於上海，改共和政體，淸廷退議政權，革命軍推翻淸廷始克告成。</p>
<p>在這簡單的紀載上，我們深知在異族下有三百年的歷史，而能使於辛亥的「十月十日」起義，把整個的「國魂復蘇」了，這當然不是偶然的，而是流了幾許「烈士的血」！把嶽嶽的精靈來建成這座鮮血淋漓的「十字架」！</p>
<p>可是民國成立之後，袁氏專政。造成了二次革命，迨後雲南起義，袁氏帝制失敗，繼之而府院爭權，張勲復辟，軍閥割據，連年天災人禍，把「復蘇的國魂」又陷於昏迷不醒的狀態下，這是想了「先天不足」，「後天失調」的病症，迨北伐成功，才又把昏迷的「國魂稍蘇」。</p>
<p>然而，述年給軍閥們戕伐過甚，興建匪易，而日寇則乘隙以一進，「九一八一的潘陽流血，「一二八」的淞滬之役，最後是「八一三」，經過了堅苦的「八年抗戰」，造成了幾許可歌可泣的故事。</p>
<p>在今天勝利後第三度的「國慶紀急」，不禁暦顚沛的「國魂」歏息。</p>
<h3>革命者</h3>
<p>— 雲堯</p>
<p>晚上和一個戰時朋友聊天，偶然間又談着了過去在淪陷區工作時，令人最感的厭的「革命草」。雖然時過境遷、它所給取暖我的壞印象，已隨着時間的消逝，慢慢褪淡下去了，但是一提起它的名字，腦際間驀然又會翻起歷歷猶如眼前的許多回憶來。</p>
<p>在上海似乎看不到「革命草」的踪跡，所以我敢相信會有許多人對這個不新不舊的名字，感到生疏，現在讓我來作個簡單的介紹吧！</p>
<p>「革命草」的形狀，很像萎草，莖端出葉，略成三角形，色嫩靑，浮生於水面，遠看頗易錯認爲菱草，自然它也有根，但並不着於水底泥面，所以在他沒有相當繁盛發生橫貫力量之前，也如浮萍一樣，隨風所至，不過它的繁　極快，只要沒有過久的大風，雖然初僅疏落幾朶，但一週半月，可能佔布整個河浜，而且生來　緊　密，相互切貼，因之船隻相遇，甚受阻碍。</p>
<p>據說：它的種子，是慈禧太后從外國取來的，它的原名並非「革命」二字，這是因爲後來國民黨發動革命，推翻了滿淸，所以慢慢傳別爲「革命」的。也有人設它是國民革命軍開始北伐時才有的，因爲先前沒有這樣的草，所以都不識其名，於是就　適當時潮流，把它呌做「革命草」。到底是怎樣的？那只有請植物學家去硏老明定了，不過適應時代，我們暫且以「革命草」呼之，似乎也不怎樣不妥。</p>
<p>不過顧名思義，它既然被稱爲「革命草」一那末它也該如我們人類引用的「革命」二字的字義一樣，在水草的圈子裏，應是負有一種革故　新，改造環境的使命的，可是事實上，它所表現的過程和終極的結果，却是名實不符，因爲它所到的地方，雖然其餘的水面障　物，會被它驅走或淹沒了，一時氣象景色確也不無煥然一新之徽，但這不過是它爲自己搶奪地盤發展勢力的一種手段，其他的生命利便，却因它的覇佔，而被剝奪喪失了。</p>
<p>戰時我在杭，嘉，湖陷區工作，因爲當地多是河浜，所以行動方面，差不多都偕重於水道的船隻，因此每當敵僞軍出動掃務時，常常會因受河浜中「革命草」的糾纏阻碍，嘗受許多艱險危急的虛驚，所以那時同志間沒有不對它儈恨的，遂均改稱它爲「害命草」以示洩恨之意。</p>
<h3>國慶日感言</h3>
<p>— 恥朝</p>
<p>一年一度的國慶紀念日，又光臨了，這是多麼快樂歡躍的日子！</p>
<p>公務員，可以休息不辦公了；敎員們可以不講解了，一般的學生們，能够自由，快　地，過這個民國成立的一個紀念日。</p>
<p>不過，這個紀念的熟忱，比不得中秋，和重陽那麼普遍。因爲，鄉下的老百姓，他們只知道廢　的八月十五日，是中秋節，有月餅可吃，舊曆的九月九日，是重陽，重陽糕又是那麼甜嘴可口，但是十月十日國慶日他們根本不知道。這或者是我國吃風太甚，有了吃，才知道有這個日子的存在吧。</p>
<p>國慶日，本來有一段漫長的血淚史，說起這個歷史來，一般的人都聽得厭了，這是我們的國父，率領同志，推翻滿淸，打倒專制，建立民國創造中華的一段流血革命史，是値得紀念的。</p>
<p>曾經在報上，載過一則出乎尋常的新聞，就是說：「日本人慶祝長崎原子彈爆發一週年紀念日」。一般的人，都以爲是一件可笑的事，但是我以爲不然，我並不是贊成日寇的所爲，實在今日的國慶日，還不如說一個國恥日子，因爲先烈的鮮血，已經黯淡了；熱血已經冷了，我們這輩革命的後進，却有愧於先辈的托付，還不能把民族國家扶持入常軌，這是應該撫心自愧的。</p>
<p>人民對於政府期望正切，這是有待於我們奮力改革自我更新的。</p>
<h3>說否決權</h3>
<p>— 溥倫</p>
<p>否決權問題將成為這次聯合國大會辯論的中心，亦是大會成敗的焦點，更是關係到世界安危所　的一個難題。因爲萬一否決權被修正或被廢止的話，蘇聯和她的勢力下的其他家國很可能拂然退出聯合國，那麼世界又將陷入戰　低迷了。</p>
<p>自聯合國成立那一天起，兩年多來，它始終在鬧着一個憲法問題——否決權。現在我們來大概談一談，讓讀者知道否決權究竟是什麼？</p>
<p>在聯合國大會裏，國無大小，人各一票。凡事有三分之二贊成票，即獲通過。大會以外，還有若干理事會和一個國際法庭，在理事會中，有一個叫做安全理事會的，它管的不是文化敎育，也不過問經濟計會，它司理的部是世界和平，也即是遇到國際爭端時決定何國有理何國無理，並如何懲罰甚至制伏。這個理事會的性質成權實在超過於整個聯合國大會。</p>
<p>金山會議時，有所謂邀諸國（中英美蘇）和被邀請國之分。這就時說，這組織發起之初，便有了賓主之分。在聯大裏，賓主待遇一致，在安全理會的十一個委員中，五個是「主」，即所謂常任理事，另外六個委員是「賓」，是隔兩年一選的。第廿七條規定的是賓主間投票效力之不同。「關於程序之決議，應以七理事國之可決票表決之，對於其他一切事項之決議，應以七理事國之可決票，包括全體常任理事會之同意票表決之。」這是說，除了安全理事會本身程序問題外，听有經手的案子，都得五位主人一體同意；否則就不生效。這就是所謂「否決權。。」但憲章裏對於「否決權」也有一個限制；它把國際事件分作「情勢」和「爭端」兩種，凡是後者，則當事國無權投票。起草憲章的人插入這條，既給小國以精神的安慰，又爲大國留了金蟬脫殻的妙計，同時，也爲詭辯的外交家出下了好題目，苦心是到極點了。</p>
<p>否決權原爲聯合國憲章所賦予五强的特權，當時的理由雖在尊重五强擊潰軸心諸國的功績；但主要的目的尙在維持在聯合機構中五大强國的協調。凡所決議，不致因强國中任何一個的不滿而陷入無法執行，以至於促使聯合國分裂的危機；此種方式，雖然不免遷就現實，但在現階段的國際局勢中，則毋寗說是具有其充分的必要理由。不過因爲兩年多來蘇聯對於此項權力的濫用（使用否決權達十八次之多），以致造成凡事均難取得協議的局面。</p>
<p>人物誌</p>
<h3>歐洲的一個傑出女性希臘王后繪像</h3>
<p>— 金聲</p>
<p>希臘王后及希王保祿畫橡</p>
<p>希臘，是目前歐洲最不安定的一個國家，內憂外患，前迫頻仍，共產黨在北部的破壞活動，始終沒有停止過，暗中再加上英美蘇在地中海和近東地區的鈎心鬥角，情形就愈演愈複雜了。</p>
<p>希臘的王室，就在這種風雨飄搖的狀態中在在着。新君保祿接位不久，各方對他的認識還不够深，可是有許多人却知道他的王后，眞是一位相當傑出的人物。人家都說貝隆夫人對於阿根廷總統的影嚮極大，甚至有人說她是政治的幕後操縱者。事實上，希后對於希王保祿的影嚮，也復相似。</p>
<p>我們就在這裏，把這位王后的出身　態，見解和個性，介紹給讀者。</p>
<p>這位希臘王后是前德王威廉二世的孫女，秀外慧中，個性堅强，富有膽識，年齡剛過三十歲，她的交際手腕超人一等，在這個多難之邦中，她已獲得許多的知友了。</p>
<p>可是她不是一個好整以暇的人物。她勤於工作，　於任事。自從希臘自納粹手中獲得解放之後，她就返歸祖國，立即參加各種救濟工作。她到荒僻的鄉村，訪問貧苦的人民，可以說無遠弗屆。不論周圍的環境是怎樣貧苦惡劣，但她以王后的身份却能處之泰然，她常常推着笑容說：「我樂於顧問一切的事情。」</p>
<p>王后所最注意的，就是工作。她會經組織過許多志願工作服務團，她的熱誠使國王保祿也深受感動。有一次，他對一羣大學生說，我願意手執鋤頭，和你一起去做修路的工作。大學生報以熟烈的歡呼，聲稱願爲希臘犧牲生命。國王不贊成這種說法，而用溫和的語調鼓勵他們說：「這還不够，你們必須　希臘工作。」從這句話中，我們可以看到希王所受王后影響之深。</p>
<p>王后曾經大　疾呼地說：「今日希臘所需要的是工作，級織志願工作服務團和糊織更多的志願工作服務團。王后認爲唯有工作能使游擊隊跑出山來，做國家良好的公民。她希望政府軍獲勝，但在一旦勝利獲得之後，却主張以寬容的熊度對待「反叛」的人民。她說：</p>
<p>「我們可以救他們；他們祗是一批沒有工作沒有領導的靑年人。他們中間有幾個領袖同然是壞的，但是大多數人並不如此。」從她的政治見解中，我們可以看出她眼光的遠大。</p>
<p>王后動人的人格，有時使敵人也做了她的俘虜。有一次，她去訪問一個醫院，共中有許多叛軍的傷兵在那專治療。她挺着胸，儀熊萬方地跑進去，立在他們中間，直截地問道：「你們是不是希臘人？」傷兵們不約而同地說：「是啊。。」於是她接着說：「永遠記着這句說話，永遠永遠不要忘記你們是希臘人。」</p>
<p>王后的出生地雖然是德國，但是她深愛希臘的自然景色，甚至認爲希臘雄偉的山林，其美麗動人，尤在瑞士爾帕斯山之上。她的愛好希臘，獲得了大部份希臘民衆的好感。她的敵人說，她美麗動人的人格，是一種危險。在她的笑容的面前，就是敵人也會像白塔油一般地溶解。</p>
<p>當今希臘的王后就是這樣一位特出的人物。條頓民族的堅强個性和政治上的折衝，使她在帝制日益衰微的　　。　爲　個受人注目的王后。</p>

<h3>申報救濟醫院合辦第九屆防治少眼　慶祝申報創刋七十五周年　定額七百五十名雙十節起開始申請</h3>
<p>本報與救濟醫院聯合舉辦的「沙眼防治」運動，從去年八月開始以來，轉瞬已經一年多了。在這時期裏面，我們先後舉行了八屆沙眼防治，申請檢治的人在一千五百人左右，其中有敎師，有學生，有工人，有工商職員，也有公務人員，包括一切的階層。</p>
<p>對於這個運動，我們不敢加以太高的評價，也不敢賦與過於迫切的希望，我們的宗旨，只是想藉此喚起國人對於沙眼一疾的注視，不讓它在不知不覺間漸漸的蔓延開來，成爲民族健康的重大災患。</p>
<p>沙眼不像肺結核那麼可怕，也不像霍亂，白喉那麼能在短短的時間內致人死命，惟其如是，人們才輕輕將它忽視過去，因此無數的人，染上了沙眼，漸漸地，它成爲了中國人的「通病」。這一年來，我們設法爲已經染上沙眼的人療治，同時也帮助未患沙眼的人，防範沙眼的侵襲，居然有一千人以上已經把沙眼治愈了。</p>
<p>昨天，我們接到救濟醫院的來函，同意和本報繼續辦理第九屆的沙眼防治，名額擴大爲七百五十名，藉以慶祝本報七十五週年偉大的紀念。</p>
<p>爲了技術上的關係，七百五十名分六個月辦理，換句話說，就是每個月能够爲一百廿五位讀者免費檢查和撩治沙眼的疾患。</p>
<p>從變十節開始申請，不限性別，不限年齡，同時也不限資格，每一位讀者都有檢查和治撩沙眼的機會。</p>
<p>申請的時候，請繕就申請書，寫明姓名，性別，年齡，職業，並附一只貼足回件郵票和寫明住址的信封，以便寄奉檢查證之用。最後我們必須愼重的聲明，對於一切手續不合的申請者，我們決不發給檢查證，如此或者可使手續齊全的申請者，多獲得一些防治的機會。</p>

<h3>國慶齊天樂六章（有序）</h3>
<p>— 居正</p>
<p>龍飛中華，幾在丁亥，月令仲秋，節期雙十，聲鼓　舞，舉國若狂，嘻盛矣哉。數典溯源，國父爲開國總統，提咨國會，以八月十九日武昌首雜之日，定爲國慶。布吿中外，震鑠古今，越年三十有六，日不暇給，國慶樂章，尙闕專備，韶武之音不聞，宮商之律失序，竊不自揣，取齊天樂古調，系之以辭，擬名國慶齊天樂。樂譜云：齊天樂，慢聲也，屬黃鍾宮，拙作叶普律與否，則音樂家知之，余未諳也。抑首義在武昌城，城內形勝，爲用武所必爭，首義事前聚會寓居所在，如纍華林，黃鶴樓，抱冰堂，黃土坡，臙脂山，楚望臺等，因地即事以命題，都爲六章，略舉大凡，以資諷詠云爾。</p>
<p>曇華林</p>
<p>繼科學補習所而起之日知會，在纍華林聖公會，秘密結社，有聲有色，自我犧牲，志趣純潔，革命種子之最可歌泣者也。故首纍華林，凡以前策動團體皆屬焉。</p>
<p>南公底事哆三戶。咄咄書留讖語。桀放南巢，紂焚朝邑，不道孽由自取。血流標杵。願在莒毋忘，抗懷張楚。爍爍騍華，會元相識涵虛度。　上帝又將臨汝。爲誰科補習，別抽機杼。秘閣談經，天渠演史，喚起知心頓悟。丹書密附。歎隴上輟耕，軍中卒伍。加入同盟，一班班可數。</p>
<p>黃鶴樓</p>
<p>蔣翊武劉堯　王憲章王守愚等，依在獄劉敬菴胡瑛及大江報詹大悲之感召，約投軍同志，於辛亥元旦大會於黃鶴樓，創立文學社，酒酣耳熱時，指奧略樓楹聯云，「昔賢整頓乾坤，締造皆從江漢起僉日，此非張文襄暗示乎，我輩首義，非在武昌不可，故次黃鶴樓，羣治學社振武社皆屬焉。」</p>
<p>文襄乘興登黃鶴。侃侃寓言有託。整頓乾坤，交通文軌，胥是先民有作，恢弘奧略。看江漢炳靈，　蛇隱約。歷歷晴川，同袍燕爾修艾學。　振武何曾示弱。爲羣治協調，相同啐啄。鴻爪印泥，鷄翎插血，對此新春元朔。誓言重諾。笑督部牽裙，上房絡索。頂戴花紅，許多多可惡。</p>
<p>抱冰堂</p>
<p>文襄督鄂時，捒蛇山林　幽美處，肯構肯堂，顏曰抱冰，藉以消夏及公餘讌集之所，土庶遊息亦不禁，雅有文囿之風，爾時在營同志，往往假期聚會於此，商標營隊活動進度，至足紀也，故次抱冰堂，標營代表皆屬焉。</p>
<p>沛公兀自抒懷抱，休休更攀同好。屠狗淮徐，弄蛇芒碭，者般願聞明敎。後先號召。思漢族復興，亡秦必要。肅肅兎置，履霜共凜堅冰到。督郵迭來探報。莫漫愁破獲，別依堂奧。牙帳飛書，式門露佈，各個標營代表。及時宣導。怕空穴來風，枝頭鳩烏。漏泄春光，使哥哥着惱。</p>

<p>先是共進會型始於日木江戶，余曾爲之綱紀，迨余南去，楊時傑劉公孫武先後司共事，辛亥返武昌，孫覓寓所於黃士坡，張共進會職，復招鄧玉麟開設酒樓，杯盤狼籍之餘，不自覺豪情之激越也，故次黃土坡，工程輜重左右旗皆屬焉。明儒儘管無安土。凜凜猶存國故。嘉定三屠，揚州十日，待訪明夷卒讀。哀音似訃。况心史燈傳，綠林水滸。種種規章，揭開悉是張民族。共進相需普渡。應毋庸回互，各稱干櫓。朱貴傳餐，紅娘遞簡，漫道隋何無武。文王一怒。任禁苑吹刁，滿城風雨。咬緊牙關，一絲絲不露。</p>
<p>胭脂山</p>
<p>位山後撫署之左，共進會又設一機關於此，專爲接洽學生及新兵，沔陽監學作外圍，更加秘密首義聲中之較有史趣者，故次臉脂山，兩湖理化及測繪特別學堂皆屬焉。</p>

<h3>國父整飭官方令</h3>
<p>革命成功後，中山先生就任臨時大總統，曾頒令整肅官方，以絕倖進。該令當時木報曾載之。原文云：</p>
<p>「滿淸末年，仕途腐敗，已達極點。親貴以利祿招誘於上，士大夫以利祿市易於下。奔競弋謀，於是成風，脂韋突悌。恬不知恥。以致君子在野，自好不爲，事無與治，民不聊生，經循不悛，以底滅亡。民國成立，萬端更始，舊日城社，掃除殆盡，整飭史治，時不可失。然而法制未頒，考試未行，於進者存乘時竊取之心，用人者有高下隨心之便，一或不愼，弊將有甚於滿淸之事者。治亂之分，端在於此，言念前途，能無兢兢。南京政府本創之際，各處奔走疏附，來求一地位者，常不乏人，以此苟得之心，遂開詐僞之習。或本舊吏而冒稱新材，或甫入校而遽號畢業，蒙混誣枉，得之爲能。雖轉　統一政府成立，此地各官署，立即取消，然使不肖者持此爲進身之具，其遺患方來，何可數計。爲此令仰該部部次長等，於用人之際，務常悉心考察，愼重詮選，勿使菲材濫竽，賢能遠引，是爲至要。又查各部薦任各員，每有一人而兼兩職者，殊非愼重職務之道。薦者不知，是爲失察，受者不白，是爲冒利，皆無恥焉。以後除有特別事故，不得兼職，以肅官方，而防吏治。此令！」</p>
<p>國父此令，道盡官塲之弊，雖至今日，仍值得吾人警惕深思</p>
<h3>重慶　上海　兩地狂歡　記勝利後的第一個國慶日</h3>
<p>又是雙十節了，這是勝利後的第三個國慶日。</p>
<p>兩年前的今天，那種全國性瘋狂的慶祝，彷彿就在眼前。這兩年中，國內的政局，以及國際的情况，已有了很大的變動，在今天，我們對着兵荒馬亂的國土，飢寒失所的流民，想起二年前，剛勝利的時候，搖着旗，高喊着「慶祝國慶，慶祝勝利」的情景，不勝感慨萬千。</p>
<p>然而愈是這樣，我們愈是懷念二年前的今天，勝利後的第一個國慶日，那種熱烈瘋狂的情况。</p>
<p>一九四五年，（多麼値得興奮的一年！）日本投降了！一連串的勝利呼聲，從八月十三日起，一直到雙十節，把全巾國的人們喊啞了。過慣了國難時期的雙十節的中國人，爲了祖國重見光明而歡呼，鼓舞！「敵人的飛機炸掉了我們的家，可毀不了我們的國慶日」呀！</p>
<p>我們這裏先紀述重慶——代表火後方的各個大小城市村鎭；隨後再紀述上海，——代表曾經落入敵人手中的淪陷區域。</p>
<p>在重慶</p>
<p>一九四五年十月十日的重慶。</p>
<p>一淸早，街頭便擠滿了人，輪渡這天加了班，艙肚裏一次又一次叱出了自南岸，江北，黃桷埡，海棠溪進城的乘客，汽笛聲分外頻繁。朝天門，望龍門，儲奇門的碼頭加倍忙碌了。僅有的一條大街民族路擠得水洩不通，紥滿了彩的公共汽車還在人羣裏擠呀軋的。商店裘的夥計，三五成羣，敲着　鼓，在街上兜。林森路，中山路——一片昇騰，氣象萬千。</p>
<p>中宣部長吳國楨（現在是我們的市長了），在陪都靑年館舉行的國慶大會上致詞：「勝利後的中國，即將從事建國，重慶市民，應該爲全國人民的表率，黨政軍民團結一致，進行建國工作。每一個國民，只要對政府有信心，使政府能够充份發揮力量，建國的前途絕對樂觀！」</p>
<p>靑年團及童子軍，在夫子池新運廣塲舉行秋季大檢閱；美國新聞處在「精神堡壘」舉行勝利照片展覽；戲劇學校的學生們乘了遊行列車，在街頭表演；三小隊靑天白日的戰鬥機，擁着六架巨大的轟炸機掠過市空，一疊彩色的傳單從天上飛了出來……</p>
<p>電影院在早晨八點鐘便掛出了「客滿」牌，平時門可羅雀的川劇院，也受到了特別的靑睞。許多平時遊得膩了的地方，忽然都覺得可戀起來，連喫厭了的「榨菜炒肉絲」也覺得異常可口了。—因爲，遠離故鄉來到大後方的人們，勝利了，復員了，不久就可回家。對着這行將吿別的山城，總不免臨別依依起來。</p>
<p>山城的報紙，士黃色變了粉紅色，加印了特刊，從報販手裏飛出來，滿街飛，滿天飛……商店裏做着好生意；領袖名將，每套九張，「慶祝國慶，削碼廉售：蔣主席，杜魯門，史太林，艾德里，羅斯福，需治六世，戴高樂，陳誠，艾森張威爾…」更有無數的少男少女，在這天，完償了他們的「抗戰姻綠」！</p>
<p>熙嚷的人羣圍集在大街上，一直到黃昏，夜的黑暗不能掩蓋人們心中的興奮。到處是雪亮的燈光，V字的霓虹燈，在人們心中喚起一陣痛快的笑，笑呵！</p>
<p>在上海</p>
<p>笑呵，笑在收復區的老百姓的心頭，是有着更愉快更興奮的情緒的。十月十日的上海，是瘋狂的上海。</p>
<p>跑馬廳，—這曾經代表着帝國主義在上海的侵略史，也曾經被敵僞用來慶祝建設大東亞的廣場，是第一次被上海市民用來慶祝自己國家的節目了。國慶紀念及勝利慶祝大會，便在千千萬萬的羣衆的歡呼聲中舉行。這些參加的人，在淸晨五時起，就携了麵包乾糧，在跑馬廳門前等候，不到八時，偌大的跑馬廳中，已擠得沒有一些空隙。</p>
<p>爆竹聲在天還沒有破曉的時候，已是此起彼伏，把全上海的市民從睡夢裏喚醒過來，八時餘，市民萬人空巷，佇立於遊行經過的道旁，南京路，靜安寺路，靈飛路，亞爾培路一帶，人山人海，歡聲雷動。九時正，鳴砲一百另一嚮，全市工廠，輪船，學校，寺廟的汽笛聲，鐘馨聲，相互鳴和，同時爆竹聲更是連珠價嚮，「上海，已經是有聳的上海了！」</p>
<p>正如錢市長大鈞在慶祝大會上致詞所說的！「現在日月重光，河山收復，各界同胞，脫離敵偽的壓迫，重受國家的庇護，過去八年中所　積的寃抑之氣，得以盡量宣洩，過去八年中所隱藏的愛國之情，得以充份表達，心裏的痛快喜悅，自然不能以言語所形容，尤其是今天臨到這個偉大的佳節，參加這個熱烈的盛會，眼看國旗到處在飄揚，耳聽國歌到處在歌唱，想到過去一切恥辱業已掃除，一切覊絆業已廢棄，現在所呼吸的完全是光榮和自由的空氣，必然是歡欣鼓舞，如醉如狂，這種心境，可以說生平所未經，永世所不忘！」</p>
<p>靑年團及童子軍檢閱過後，便開抬勝利大遊行，五百餘個參加遊行的團體，包括國軍，盟軍，學生，公務員，各業工人，商人及各團體，共二十餘萬人，在三十餘個樂隊的不斷演奏進行曲聲中，從跑馬廳出發。國黨旗及聯合國旗，迎風招展，沿途各式慶祝牌樓，在千萬人的遊行隊伍中，倍見宏麗。</p>
<p>全市各大戲院，一律半價招待觀衆，擁擠是不消說的了。上午十一時錢市長在市政府設宴招待本市巾外各界貴賓，下午四時第三方面軍司令部假華懋飯店歡宴中外貴賓及空軍部隊。入晚各機關商店及慶祝牌樓的燈彩，齊放光明，絢爛奪目，市民擁擠，途爲之塞。</p>
<p>慶祝節目一連三天，盛况空前。這是中華民國有史以來，上海第一個熱烈，興奮，使每個市民永遠懷念的國慶日。</p>
<p>這情况大家都記得，其實不用多說。但三十六年的雙十節又來了，實使我們感慨萬端。在今天，針對着這樣的時局，我們必須設法使國家早日安定統一，人民安居樂業，然後再來痛痛快快地慶祝我們的雙十國慶紀念，這時間不會很遠的——也許就是明年。</p>
<h3>宋代亦有雙十節</h3>
<p>「雙十節」之名，爲吳稚老所首創，本報去年國慶特刊「雙十史話」一文由曾記其事。但查中國史上，遠在宋代之時，即已有雙十節之名。因宋徽宗生於五月初五日，即位之後，因端五鬼節俗忌，乃改至十月十日。元吳正傳師道敬鄉錄中曾記有宋詩人滕秀穎所作「雙十節」詩一首。詩云：「節逢雙十慶天寗，古殿焚香祝帝齡，耳在北方金佛刹，眼臨南極老人星；千官花覆常暗宴，萬里雲遙阻在庭；松柏滿山聊自籌，小臣孤操亦靑靑。」</p>

<h3>開國史第一頁　武昌首義檄文</h3>
<p>革命軍佔領武昌之後，聚議公舉黎元洪爲都督，出示安民，傳檄天下。檄文如次：「維中華開國四千六百零九年某月某日中華民國軍政府檄曰：夫春秋大九世之仇，小雅軍宗邦之義；况以神明華　，匐匍犬羊之下，盜僧主人，橫逆交偪，此誠不可一輖居也。惟我黃漢遺裔，交葉久昌，祖德宗功，光被四表。降及有明，遭家不造，　爾東胡，曾不介意，遂因綠禍亂，盜我神器，奴我漢人者二百六十有餘年。凶德相仍，累世暴殄；廟堂皆豕鹿之奔，四野有豺狼之嘆；羣獸喜之，羗無遠慮，谩藏誨盜，遂開門揖盜，裂　士疆，以苟延旦夕之命。久假不歸，重以破棄，非特遠胡之死罪，亦漢族之奇羞也。軍政府奉茲大義，顧瞻山河，秣馬厲兵，日思放逐。徒以大勢未集，忍辱至今，亦復屢遺偏師，兼選義士，颼馳搏擊，呼我漢風。此誠我俠士雄夫所爲鬱鬱久居者也。天奪其魄，牝鷄失晨，塊然胡　，冒昧居攝；遂使羣小俱進，　亂朝野，鬥聚金壁，以官爲市；强敵見而生心，小民望而感額，犬羊之性食言而肥，則復有僞收鐵道之舉。喪權誤國，刧奪在民，憤毒之氣，鬱爲雲雷。由鄂而湘，而粵，而川；扶搖大風捲地俱起，土崩之勢已成，橫流之決，翹足而俟；此眞胡逆授命之秋，漢族復興之會也。軍政府總攝機宜，恭行天罰，懼議師所指或未達悉，致疑畏之徒，普事惶惑，僻遠諸彥，莫知奮起，愛先以獨立之羨布吿我國人曰：在昔虜運方盛，則實以野人生潑，彎弓而鬥，談目瞻舌，習爲豺狼，是以「索倫」凶聲，播越遠近。入關之秋，即舉其强梁，徧據要津，而令吾民輸粟轉金，篆其醜類，以制我諸夏。傳世九葉，則放誕淫侈，愈二百載，夤緣苟偷，以襲取高位。枯骨盈廷，人爲行尸。故「太平」之職，功在漢賊。甲午之役，九廟俱震，近益岌岌，祖宗之地，北削於儀，南奪於日，廟堂闃寂，卿相嘻嘻，近貴以善賈爲能，大臣以賣國相長，本根已斬，枝葉　亂，虎皮蒙馬，聊有外形，舉而蹴之，若拉枯朽，是虜之必敗者一。昔三桂啓關，漢家始覆，福酋定鼎，益因緣漢賊爲之佐命，稍浴漢風，遂事羈糜。維時中邦大勢已去，義士　伏，迂懦小生，勿能自固。遂被逼脅，反顏事仇，漸化腥羶，遂忘大義。合葉於蕕，以逆爲正。孑孑貪夫，時效小忠，虜遂宴然高踞，驕吸民脂，浸淫二百年。漢族義師，屢蹶不起。愛及洪王，幾復漢土，亦以曾胡左李以本族之彥，倒行逆施，遂使虜危而復安，久留不去。此實「孝孫」之醉，非逆胡之可長也。方今大義日明，人心思漢，觥觥碩士，烈烈雄夫，莫不敬天愛祖，高其節義。雖有搢紳，已汙僞命，以被官邪，皆興金輦璧，因貨就利，鄙薄驕虛，毋任艱鉅。虜實不競，漢臣復匱，盲人瞎馬，相與徘徊。是虜之必敗者二。邦國遷移，動在英豪，成於衆志，故傑士奮臂，風雲異氣，人心解體，變亂則起。十稔以還，吾族巨子，斷脰決腹者，踵相接。從以民習其常，毋能大起。虜遂刦持其間，因以苟容，遷延至今。乃以立憲改官，詐僞無信，借債收路，重陷吾民，星星之火，乘風燎原，川湘鄂粵之間，編戶齊民，奔走呼號，山谷嚮震，一夫奮臂，萬姓景從，頹波橫流，敗舟航之，是虜之必敗者三。昔我皇祖—黃帝—　造中夏，奄有九州。唐處繼世，三王奮迹，則文化彬彬，獨步宇內，煌煌史册，逾四千年。博大寬仁，民德久著。衡之西歐，則遜其條理耳。先覺之民，神聖之胃，智蓋優渥，宜高踞土惡，折衝宇宙。乃銳降莫種，低首下心，以爲人役；背光不孝，喪國無勇，失身不義。潛德幽光，望古遙集。瞻我生身，弔景漸愧，返性則明，知恥則勇，「孝思不匱，永錫爾類」，則漢族之當興者一。「大道之行，天下爲公」，國有至尊，是曰人權，平等目由，樂天歸命，以生爲體，以法爲界，以和爲德，以衆爲量。一人橫行，謚曰「獨夫」，凉被武王，遂有典型，滿虜潛竊，更益驕姿，分道駐防，坐食齊民，厚祿高官，皆分子姓，脅肩詔笑，武斷朝堂，國土國權，斷送惟意，束我言論，遏我大羣，擾我閭閻，誣我善良，鋤我秀士，奪我民業，囚我代表，殺我議員，天地晦盲，民聲銷沉，牧野洋洋，檀軍煌煌，復我自由，還我家鄉，則漢族當興者二。海水飛騰，雄强參會，弱國孱種，夷爲犬豕，民有羣德，朝有英彥，威能達旁，如競爭而存耳。雖我中華，危於遠虜，根本參差，國力遂糜，虜更無狀，魚餒肉敗，腥聞四布，遂引羣敵，乘間抵隙，邊境要區，割削盡去，附背扳吭，及其祖廟，臥榻足側，鼾聲四起，耳目蔀覆，手足繁維，遂使我漢土堂奧盡失，民氣痿痺，將破碎顚連，轉饗封豕，不去慶父，魯難未已，廓而淸之，駿雄良村，握手俱見，萬方肅穆，羣敵銷聳，則漢族之當興者三。維我四方猛烈，天下豪雄，既審斯義，宜各率十弟，乘時躍起，雲集嚮應，無小無大，盡去其害，執訊獲醜，以奏膚功，維我伯叔兄弟，諸姑姊妹，既審斯義，宜矢其決心，合其大羣，堅忍其德，緜緜其力，進戰退守，與猛士俱，維爾失節士友，被逼軍人，爾有身生，爾亦漢族。既審斯義，宜有反悔，宜速遷善，宜常懷本根，思其遠祖，宜倒爾戈矛，毋逆義師，毋作好細。維爾　人，爾在漢土，爾爲囚徒，既審斯義，宜知天命，宜返爾部落，或變爾形性，願化齊民，爾則無罪，爾乃獲赦宥。軍政府則與四方俊傑為茲要約曰：自州縣以下，其各擊殺　吏，易以選民，保境為治。又每州縣興師一旅，愈其同仇，以專征伐，擊殺　吏，肅淸省會，共和爲政。軍政府則大選將士，親率六師，犂庭掃穴，以復我中夏，建立民國。軍政府則又爲軍中之約曰：凡在漢胡，萄被脅迫，但事事降服，皆大赦，勿有所問。其有挾衆稱戈，稍抗顔行，殺無赦！故違軍法，殺無赦！以此布吿天下如律令！」</p>
<h3>漫談各國國慶</h3>
<p>一年一度，又逢雙十。在慶祝之餘，且就手頭資料所及，談談世界各國的國慶情形。</p>
<p>予我們印象最深刻的，要算法國的國慶。因爲戰前上海有法租界存在，每逢七月十四那一天，如瘋如狂的慶祝情形，上海市民一定還能記憶。那時候的顧家宅公園（即現時復興公園），門口紮起電炬通明的凱旋門牌樓，園子裏掛滿三色旗與紅綠電燈，照耀得像火樹銀花一般，並且佈置了小型火車呈橋山洞等等兒童玩具，閱兵典禮就在國內舉行。租界內自外灘起經法大馬路至霞飛路福開森路止，馬路兩旁　懸紅白藍三色燈彩旗幟，法領署，法捕房救火會，法商各公司商號，私人住宅，以及停泊黃浦江中的法國兵艦都懸燈結綵，從十三夜九時起就一律放明，眞是城開不夜，美麗得像天堂一般，有幾年還在晚上舉行提燈會，那才眞熱鬧啦。</p>
<p>民國廿六年的一次報上有這樣記載：「燈陣自大自鳴鐘法租界巡捕房出發，經愛多亞路敏體尼蔭路寗興街法大馬路，先是兩面紅布尖角大旗，上寫大自鳴鐘白字，各式各樣彩紙紮成的花燈接在後面，有長方形的，有圓筒形的，五顏六色，都由安南人的女孩子掮着，一輛裝置　鼓的花轎，六個人拱着，四週團繞，一羣吹鼓手大打大擂，隨後是一個安南人裝扮像姜太公，手裏拿着漁網魚竿，搖頭擺尾，在路上表演各種姿態，接着仙鶴，龍頭，大靑蛙，綠毛烏龜，都是紙紥的模型，套在人身上爬行，還有許多武裝的法僑傘着雪克戈矛跟在後面臨督。沿路放着爆竹，每到十字路口燈火和旗幟圍成一個大圓圈，讓龍燈靑蛙仙鶴烏　姜太公在圈子裏跳來跳去，看熱鬧的人很擁擠，到九時半忽然降下一陣大雨，燈會便在大煞風景的情况下結束了。」那時候看熱鬧的人眞是從四面八方如潮而至，在馬路兩旁圍成的人牆足有幾尺厚，因此往往在喜劇中產生了悲劇，或是孩子失蹤啦，或是女人被辱啦，或則大肚皮被擠壞啦。使次日的報紙上增加不少新聞材料。</p>
<p>英國的國慶亦即是王室的喜事，最熱鬧的一次要算一九三七年英王喬治六世的加冕典禮了。全球英屬各地，莫不熱烈慶祝。舉行加冕地點的倫敦，當然更是盛况空前，預早三個月以前就開始籌備，經費化去十五萬餘金鎊，各國都派代表參觀，在大典期前數日，倫敦各處已佈置一新，「道旁旗桿林立，高　雲霄，其上裝有巨大王冕，遍挿小旗，亦有飾成盾形，綴以鮮花，亦有綴成國王王后御名首GE兩字者，五采繽紛，絢爛美觀，通旁人行道上則爲看台所在，亦復滿綴鮮花。各處好奇之士，傾城來觀，熙來攘往，擁擠不堪，」迨至加冕前夕，「天色尙未暗時，羣衆已集於儀仗所經之路，準備終夜等候，其中有年已　　藥，更有携蓬帳俱來，準備露宿街小者，夜兩半，全路已坐滿四五排人矣。」加冕之日，典禮吿成後，王與后自成斯敏斯特大敎堂啓蹕返宮，「其時雖大雨如注，而道旁民衆，人山人海，一見御輦，無不高聲歡呼，久久不絕，白金漢宮前萬頭攢動，齊唱「神佑國王之歌，並高呼吾人欲見我王與小公主，王與后及公主兩人遂均出臨露台，羣衆莫不向之歡呼，迨至晚間九時，民衆依然未散。」估計那天參觀加冕大典儀仗的人羣約有二百萬人之多，人叢中感覺不適或遇意外受傷者九千餘人，有一老人被擠窒息而斃。事後仗儀所經街道上，紙　報紙玻瓶橘皮等遍地皆是，當　出動大批淸道失才能淸除云云。</p>
<p>美國人是年靑熱情的民族，逢到高興的事總是盡情狂歡，何况是國家的獨立紀念，所以每年的美國國慶我們大概都可以在報上讀到不少人在狂歡中遭遇意外而死亡的消息，這也可說是「樂極生悲」了吧。去年爲勝利後第一次美國國慶，上海美僑的慶祝情形也很熱鬧，那天「上午十一時，福州路上車水馬龍，駐滬總領事台維斯天婦招待海陸軍軍官及僑民於美國俱樂部二樓，到來賓數百人，濟濟一堂。十二時正，台維斯宣讀總統文吿，全場一致舉杯遙祝總統健康，情况至爲熱烈。下午一時至五時，巡洋艦洛杉磯號開放招待來賓，艦上懸旗結綵，氣象一新。晚九時，海軍船隻放射探照燈，黃浦江上銀蛇飛舞，光芒萬丈。江面烟霧在强光照射下，恍似罩上一層靑紗帳幔，燈光反復照射於沿江之魏峨巨廈，明暗交錯，蔚成奇觀，邁爾西愛路之法國俱樂部及靜安寺路暨跑馬應之海陸軍俱樂部均舉行盛大舞會，狂歡至深宵始散。」</p>
<p>蘇聯慶祝十月革命紀念日常常帶有示威的性質，尤其是一九四〇年歐洲局勢非常緊張時的那一次。據塔斯社通訊報導；全國人民一致熱烈慶祝，各街道人山人海，工人僱員文化份子及學生均在彼等工廠及學校中舉行嚴肅集會，十時羣衆魚貫進入紅傷，參觀軍事檢閱，斯達林等入傷時，羣衆報以熱烈歡呼。紀念會中丁莫生柯大元帥發表演說勗勉全民團結，並云「紅軍充分準備迎擊敵人。」旋即檢閱軍隊，達一小時半之久，爲紅軍力量之强大表現，在檢閱中，各式蘇聯飛機亦飛至紅塲上空，鐵甲軍坦克車及新式大砲尤使人有深刻之印象云云。這一天上海方面蘇僑總會發起，邀拉特維亞立陶宛愛沙尼亞僑民參加，舉行舞會，共達五日，並開映蘇聯出品「互獎」與一九一八年之列寗影片。蘇僑協會且邀本市白俄與會，但遭拒絕，白俄均於該日赴白俄敎堂祈禱，以示哀悼之意。</p>
<p>北歐的荷蘭爲一王國，女王成廉明娜深受民衆愛戴，大戰時荷蘭深受戰禍，今則國土重光，撥亂迫治。今年二月十八日第四女王孫誕生，全國狂歡慶祝，本報特約記者通訊描寫稱：「荷蘭傳統之歷史舊習，每遇王家大事，恒先用前麾輕驕，飛馳傳報與民間，是日全境大小各城休似一日，男女老少空巷而出，猶見前麾輕騎，作開路之先鋒，冠冕堂　，氣勢赫奕。綜觀此一日，各城市大同小異之慶管熟情，足誌者有下述要點：　祝賀王室大喜之自動軍交馳，分由東西南北各方次第出發，悉以誕生女王孫之儲宮爲最後集中目的地。　晴風麗日下之執旗遊行，　活潑靑年之鼓樂遊行，　市中山廣傷之升旗演說及奏樂，　巷角街頭之燈前狎舞，　禮拜堂之鐘聲祝禱………」</p>
<p>有世界公園之稱的瑞士，雖然位置在歐洲幾個强國之間，兩次世界大戰却始終沒有受到戰禍，眞可以說是人間的天堂。瑞士現在是慶建共和國，國慶　美八月一日，他們　泰民富，遇到國慶日的快樂，當然更非其他國家所能比擬。瑞士人慶祝國慶有種特別的風俗，就是遍山漫野的放起烟火，遠遠望去，就像一串串的珍珠般閃耀着光芒，據說在十三世紀瑞士尙未統一時，酷愛自由的許維士等三洲的居民聯合起來組織一個聯邦，相約以舉烽火爲號，互相帮助抵禦外侮，所以現在瑞士每逢國慶，總要放烟火來紀念這聯邦制度的創立者。瑞士人酷愛古風，在國慶這一天，全國的晨夫都穿了五顏六色的華應服裝帶着敲樂器　　隊遊行，載歌載舞，陪　　　處一叮叮　噹」的鍊聲，眞使人有「　化登仙」之感，而瑞士人又極爲好客，他們的乳酪聞名全球，假如你有幸作客瑞士，湊巧逢到國慶，他們一定會請你飽餐一頓呢！</p>
<p>北平國慶剪辮子</p>
<p>北平舉行首屆國慶大典，極為嚴肅，並將「大淸門」改為「中華門」，以資紀念。下午，市民赴各會塲者，人山人海，街道為之塡塞，琉璃一處，到者有十萬人，該處有種種行樂之所，其主要物為演唱革命新劇，尙有一處羅列已死及生存之革命偉人肖像。更有可以發噱之一事，則為若干人聚集城門之外，執剪以伺，凡有辮者，須令去辮，始許入城，多數人皆默不作聲，　人為之剪去。僅有數人，憲怒遁走。不及多時，地上髮辮憶成一大堆。</p>
<p>此外，全城民衆，極形歡騰，中外人民皆謂從來未見如此萬衆一心者。至滿洲路親貴，並未露面，殊堪注。彼等深恐臨塲後，引起漢人嫉視之心，故不敢出首，此誠無謂之恐怖。惟蔭昌晟間參與典禮，而為貴賓這一。外城之人，因遇慶典，無不興高彩烈，舞蹈歌呼，而禁城之中，則關無動靜，其中居者，已不復為人民所注意，足見城內已寂寥無人也。</p>

<h3>袁世凱雙十宣誓就職記</h3>
<p>民國十一年雙十節，袁世凱之子袁寒雲曾撰一文，題曰「雙十節之回顧」，刊於本市某報，其中一段記述民國二年袁世凱在北京宣誓就職時之情形頗詳，茲轉錄如下：</p>
<p>「癸丑雙十節，爲開國慶祝令辰之始，亦先公受任之日。是日，微雨濛濛，寒陰鬱鬱，予侍先公，乘輿入太和門，升太和殿，殿中央留陛去座。先公登陛宣誓，外交團及議員文武諸官，分立陛之左右。先公誓畢出登天安門閱兵，肅肅穆穆，氣象萬千，甲寅乙卯，政太平時，尤極富麗堂皇之盛—丙辰而後，世亂日厲，國慶之日，年遜一年，今歲慶節，適夏曆八月二十日，爲先公誕辰，天災既降，兵禍復結，追昔興懷，彌深哀痛！聊書數語，以紀吾傷！」</p>
<h3>首屆國慶在南京</h3>
<p>第一次國慶紀念，南京各界莫不情緒熱烈，而以軍界爲尤甚。自接奉都督通令後，官長目兵均以爲民國成立，　我輩軍人手造，故一律願捐薪餉十分之一，藉作紀念各種經費。第八師司令署前，用松枝紮成三角形之電燈台兩座，邊綠紙花，中嵌國旗及陸軍旗，入夜大放光明，宛如不夜之城，第三，第七兩師亦於附近之繁盛市街，用松枝花朶紥成　坊，上綴電燈以壯觀瞻。以故士女之游觀者，大有　擊肩摩之狀</p>
<p>都督府承政處派員在中正街萬奪宮整備致祭諸先烈各種物品，需時至二星期之久，頗極完備。東轅門用花紥「崇德」二字，西轅門用花紥「報功」二字，照壁則五色電燈旗，耀人眼簾，旁用松花紥成革命紀念四大字，大門內牌樓嵌「山河奠定，復旦光華」八大字，正　供民國死難諸先烈神位一座，四圍均用花綵　成，走廊則萬國旗飄，各處門戶均懸有國旗或陸海軍旗，入夜電光一發，尤覺光耀奪目云。</p>
<p>九日，十日，十一日三夜，最爲熱鬧，各軍隊均行提燈會，普通燈則用五色國旗，或書「革命週年紀念」，或書「光復紀念」，或書「鐵血立國週年紀念」；特別燈則用獅燈，取中國如睡獅猛醒之意。其餘各種花燈，名目不一，光怪陸離中，時聞軍歌聲，每過都督府及至萬壽宮，則高聲三呼紀念萬歲。八師，七師及造幣廠均大放烟火，人民觀者，以萬計，洵極千載一時之盛。</p>
<p>都督府於十日上午，宴請各國領事及各局所主耍人員，各軍隊獨立營團以上均與焉。此外，則自治公所，政界，學界，紳商兩界，計共達一百五十人以上，座爲之滿。程都督於宴會前演說，語極謙和，一時拍手如雷。下午三時，黃克强先生至第一舞台演說「革命歷史」，謂民國成立，實由死義諸先烈，前仆後繼，再接再厲之功，今日躬逢盛典，當無忘去年今日及以前諸先烈死義之種種苦痛，此後締造共和，斗惟　者之責，不然有何面目以對諸先烈在天之靈云云。是晚，程都督復寡請本府各處司員，亦均用西餐云。</p>
<h3>李亞東做官覃理鳴看馬</h3>
<p>武昌起議，淸廷傾覆之後，一部分同志對於革命的　意義尙不大明瞭，以爲天下既已奪得，當可過過官癮了。居院長覺生所撰「梅川日記」中曾記有黨人軼事一則，頗饒興味。革命成功後，黨人李亞東出獄，領漢陽府，於是立即去買了藍綢袍，靑馬褂，每天坐了四人綠呢大轎，和前淸知府出巡的派頭一樣，前面旗傘執事，鳴鑼開道，前呼後擁，威風凜凜。張難先看見了，向他規勸，他却反辯道，如此排塲，百姓才知有官，如果不用旗傘，就不威嚴。有一天，李到都督府去，照樣旗傘大轎，鳴鑼開道，却給都督府的衛兵喝令停住，斥爲滿淸怪物，大聲喝打。李嚇得面如土色，不作一聲。</p>
<p>另有關於覃振看馬的一則軼事，亦記於「梅川日記」中。（按覃為前司法院副院長，數月前在滬逝世。）覃在湖南出獄以後，到武昌的外交部去訪胡瑛，胡向他打官腔，說：「理鳴來得太遲，本部沒有好缺，只有鸚鵡洲驛站，有馬兩匹，還沒派人看管，事也淸閒，肯屈就嗎？」覃一笑而去，於是同志都說「覃振看馬」。</p>

<h3>主席十年來國慶訓詞　高豎勝利指路碑　欣逢雙十·節節進展</h3>
<p>二十六年　今年的國慶日，是我們國家憂患困苦最嚴重的時期，但也是我們民族復興唯一重要時期。</p>
<p>這一次抗戰，是死中求生的一戰，必須經過非常的危險和艱難，纔能够得到最後的勝利。全國同胞，一定要在實實在在的覺悟，知道初步的努力，必須繼之以更大的勇氣和犧牲。我們要認定這次抗戰，斷不是一年半載短期間可以了結的事，要預想到今後的困苦艱難，只有一天天的加重；因此，必須準備着一切，來擔當比今天還要艱難困苦到幾十倍的境遇。我們唯有立定犧牲到底的決心，纔能達到民族生存的目的</p>
<p>就在今天這個重要紀念日，願人人立定決心；追蹤幾十年來革命先烈的軌範。踏着我們前方將士的血跡，一致奮起，爲國努力。抗戰是一定勝利的！中華民國一定有光輝燦爛的前途！承運輸，否則情願不受接濟，所以如此者；英國不願在接濟品支付美金代價以外，再以美金擔負運費，使國際收支更趨逆勢也，以理論言之；海洋運輸與國際貿易係不可分者，歷年輸入數字之龐大，戰前如此，戰後復如此，致使吾國始終陷於貧弱狀况，故今日欲發展國際貿易，一方面應獎勵外銷品之生產，一方面則發展運輸並保護航業。</p>
<p>我國輪輪噸位，現雖有七十餘萬噸，以我國幅員之廣，航綫之長，上述船噸數字，自不够應用，值此不平等條約已經解除，英美各國仍奇與我同情之際，我國政府亟當利用此黃金時代，訂立獎勵國人從事航業方策，並鼓勵造船，興辦水運保險等，果能如此；國家經濟前途不難好轉。今逢申報創立已七十有五載，而招商局創辦至今亦適七十五年，敢借諸報端一角，向賢明政府作四項建議如下，是渴望吾國富強而作此劇呼也：</p>
<p>發展航業—一方面並添設大規模造船廠，在目前過渡時期，可向外國訂購大量重噸兼載客貨之船隻，並於必要時派海軍維護航運。</p>
<p>實行獎勵—設立造船及業務兩種獎金，造船一項由政府補貼之相當之百分率，作爲獎金，業務方面，獎勵航行次數快捷穩妥之輪船及員工，並保護其利潤</p>
<p>管制貨源—政府業已頒佈數種物資禁止輸入，此項明令，務飭自海關堅決實施，物資輸也及運入，應即由行政院通令各有關機關，儘量交國輸運送。</p>
<p>公營保險—船壳保險，貨物保險，運費保險，非由政府經營一健全保險機構，不足以或勵航商及運貨商人勇往向前。公營保險，不以牟利爲目標，而以保障航商爲宗旨，以政府信用經營此項事業，自較私人爲之爲優，由此航業政策可以推進，使航商有恃無恐，航運事業，得以猛進，若吾國政府可在五年或一定時期之內，將航業扶持得相當發達，國際貿易，必可轉趨優勢。葢強健水上運輸工具—輪船充足後，運出物資如桐油，猪鬃，鑛砂，茶葉，爆竹皆毋須仰仗外輪，其他手工業如磁器，繡貨，雕刻，漆器，藥材等，久已爲西方人士所歡迎，皆可用我自有船隻運往國外試獲市塲，由此外匯可望源源獲得，吾國可以用手工業製造之品換取工業之機械器皿，使農業化之中國徐徐步入工業之途，而名副其實的與英·美·加拿大等國，並列爲世界強國。</p>
<p>二十七年</p>
<p>現在我們的艱苦奮鬥，又是一年了。拿今天的情形，和去年今日相比較，我們誠然是失陷了更大的地區，死亡了更多的英勇將士和同胞，遭受了更凶殘慘酷的犧牲，但是有一個很顯着的不同之點，就是去年今日，我們同胞對抗戰前途的認識，還是有多少迷茫躊躇，現在却已經有一致清楚的認識了。</p>
<p>我們這一年多的抗戰，提起了全中國男女老幼民族意識的自覺，這十五個月以來，無數同胞在接觸戰爭的現實中間，已經镕籌出一個有希望有前途的民族新生命。</p>
<p>我們　總理畢生倡導革命，他的目的就是要「以建民國，以建大同。」我們抗戰勝利，不但我國必成，而對於世界和平的貢獻，也非常之遠大。但在另一方面說，我們當前的責任，也是格外的重大。我要求我全國同胞們要特別注意到，現在是我們中國生死存亡的時期，我們中華民族到今天，當然更可證明是決沒有被人征服或滅亡的顧慮，但是我們今日的奮鬥，並不僅是使中國不人征服或滅亡而已，實在是要求國家獨立，民族平等，使我們中華民族子子孫孫，千秋萬世，永久的平等自由生存於世界，達到我國建國理想的大同之治。</p>
<p>二十八年</p>
<p>淪陷地區父老兄弟諸姑姐妹及全國同胞公鑒：今日爲我中華民國二十八年艱苦抗戰，已及三年，緬懷先烈締造之艱難，瞻亡命革命前途之光明，知我全國同胞，必皆有奮勵前急起直追之熱忱，誓驅敵寇，清除奸偽，以確奠我中華民國獨立平等之基礎。在此最後勝利接近之會，必將隨之而益見艱鉅，當此光榮革命紀念日，中正願以最急要這數義，爲吾同胞剴切陳之：</p>
<p>第一，吾同胞必須認清吾國今日爲革命期中之國家，吾人之抗戰，實爲實現三民主義，完成國民革命，古今來革命事業，必須歷無數之險阻艱難，方能達到成功，絕無僥倖速成之理，然革命勢力一經發動，不達目的決不終止。</p>
<p>第二，吾同胞當知今後抗戰之成功，不全在於軍事之優勢，而在於全國同胞共同奮鬥之精神如何。</p>
<p>第三，吾人今日求得抗戰勝利之唯一要義，端在誅斥漢奸，以毀滅敵人政治進攻之工具。</p>
<p>同胞乎「作始也簡，將畢也鉅。」革命大業，祇有前進，決不反顧，抗戰大業，惟有成功，斷不失敗。</p>
<p>二十九年</p>
<p>回溯我們中華民國成立的經過，我們要一致追念畢生爲國民革命奮鬥的　總理。由於我們總理偉大的領導，與我們無數先烈的慷慨赴義，爲國犧牲，在今天抗戰緊要關頭和世界空前鉅變之際，我全國忠勇軍民，必須一秉　總理的敎訓，抱定堅確的信心，作勇銳之努力。我們要驅逐敵人，完成先烈未竟之業，就要有先烈的革命精神和戰鬥精神。</p>
<p>我們的國家，誠然是在存亡危急之際，然而我們今日，較之辛亥先烈所處的環境，較銳之各國革命建國當時的環境，則優越得多，順利得多。</p>
<p>我們抱定信心，不問環境如何；國際形勢有利的時候，固然要努力，就是在過程中間，國際上對我抗戰形勢不利的時候，我們更是要奮鬥到底。</p>
<p>東亞興亡，世界盛衰的責任，全在我們這一輩人的身上。這責任不能躲避，必須堅起脊梁，站定脚步，以至忠勇至仁愛之精神，完成至偉大至莊嚴，救國救世的事業。</p>
<p>三十年</p>
<p>今年一年中，有最可紀念者二事：一曰國際和平之大義顯見昭着，反侵略之陣營益趨鮮明，二曰我國已躋於國際地位平等之階段，國父平生廢除不平等條約之宿願，迄茲已獲得第一步之成功，此誠事之至可慶者。</p>
<p>我全國知識份子與社會領導人士，必當正視現實，認識中國革命之特質，負起天下興亡之大任，倡導同胞，盡瘁生產，致力科學，以奠國防，以裕經濟，克服一切艱危，確定勝利保障。</p>
<p>當此革命成功，勝利在望之時，凡我同胞，誠宜特別警惕，各竭其能，各盡其實，競競業業，以竟全功。</p>
<p>三十一年</p>
<p>吾人之抗戰即所以求建國，而建國規模，則必須完成於戰時。建國大業，經緯萬端，但綜其要道，　不外二者：曰勤儉，曰寫</p>
<p>實。中正於本年元旦以後，迭次以實行戰時生活，遵行總動員法令，勗勵我同胞；乃今日一般社會迄無積極緊張之氣象，亦無克苦篤實之風尚，曾不念淪區同胞水深火熱之苦况，亦不思前綫將士節衣縮食浴血捨命之艱辛。此種惡習，如不根本覺悟，澈底革除，則不待敵軍之深入，而我民族必將自趨於滅亡。</p>
<p>須知戰時生活，當然艱苦，以吾人今日所處之境地，與　國父先烈革命時代櫛風沐雨缺衣乏食之情形相比擬，則吾人已遠爲優裕；何况吾人欲担當復興建國民族百世之偉業，正須以「苦其心志，餓其體膚，空乏其身」者，鍛煉吾人之身心，發揚民族之志節，方能勝此任重致遠之職責。</p>
<p>民軍佔領武昌時之黃鶴樓</p>
<p>三十二年</p>
<p>全國軍民同胞：今天是民國三十二年的國慶紀念日，中正適於今日忝膺國民政府的重任。覺得負荷艱鉅，責任重大。</p>
<p>我們中華民國的成立，肇始於辛亥革命的成功。辛亥革命成功的迅速，在世界歷史上開一未有的創例。這完全證明了國民革命的目的，是民意共同的歸趨，而我們革命建國，實現三民主義的大業，是應乎人心合乎時代，雖經千回百折而必底於成。我們爲達到這個目標，尤應恢張民志，集中民力，這就要我全國同胞深切體認　國父所說：「國家之本，在於人民」與「億兆人民繫於國家」的兩句遺訓。知道人民與國家樸素關係的密切，知道實現民權主義實爲建國的基本工作。如果我們民權主義完全實現，四萬萬五千萬同胞，共來担當國家民族的重任，那勻們國家的進步，更是不可限量，民權主義的民主政治，所以爲政治的極則，其理由就在於此。</p>
<p>但是我們還要知道，實行民權主義有他必要的前提。民主政治的精神全在於守法，如果法紀不守，則民主制度即根本破壞，民國亦隨之危殆，所以必須我們國民認識自由與法治的眞締，養成尊重自由與遵守法紀的習慣，而後民主政治才有確實的基礎。世界上任何民主國家，民權的行使與自由的享受，都不能超越法治的範圍。無論民權如何發達，自由如何廣泛，而法定的軌轍，必須上下一致，共同信守。凡是法律規定的義務，都應該積極履行，不消規避；法律所規定的權得，亦應一律平等，共同享受。必須如此，民主政治才可以眞正實現，民權主義方能完全告成。今後我們中華民國欲立國於世界，必須全國上下養成守法的習慣，以國家的利害爲個人的利害，以民族的休戚爲個人的休戚，不規避應盡的責任。政府官吏固須忠於職守，全體人民亦應共負責任，以貢獻其能力。如此我們的國民乃能爲眞正自由的國民，我們的國家乃能獲得眞正平等的地位。</p>
<p>三十三年</p>
<p>我們中華民國，在這三十三年的中間，雖然經歷了無數憂患艱難，終因我們全國同胞愛護民國的赤誠，與保障民國的決心，而突破了種種的艱危。我們神聖抗戰已經七年有餘，現在最後勝利已經擺在面前。我更要全國同胞在此最後勝利尚未獲得之前，對於我們國家的地位與革命的形勢，以及目前的戰局，和我們應該警覺注意之點，有切實的檢討和明確認識。</p>
<p>第一，我要爲我們同胞指明的，我們今日的國家是革命中的國家，我們的政府和軍隊是革命期中的政府和軍隊，都不能以常例來指摘判別。在政治，經濟方面，我們固自知缺點甚多，弱點亦復不少，我們當然要積極改進，力謀進步。但要知道，有許多缺點與弱點，是任何國家在革命期中，或者通國家在交戰時期都不能避免的。所以決不能以此獨爲中國詬病，更不能以此爲指摘攻擊政府的武器，徒爲敵人和漢奸張目。我們革命政府和人民只知道依公理正義爲基礎，以求達到他的革命目標，和實現他的三民主義。革命者心目之中根本沒有什麼是危險，什麼是失敗的觀念。</p>
<p>第二，我要爲我們同胞指明的，就是今天我們中國在國際上的地位和我們在反侵略戰爭中的責任。大家必須知道，無論世界戰局及其戰略如何變化，今日東亞戰爭決不能沒有我們中國。世界安危與和平的前途，也與我們中國革命的成敗有密切的關係。因爲東亞戰爭如果沒有我們堅貞奮鬥的中國，必不能得到完全勝利的結果，而世界和平如果沒有獨立自由的中國，亦必不能有眞正實現的一日。我們國家對世界對人類的地位和責任有如此的重大關係，所以我們更不可不自愛自重，自立自強。</p>
<p>三十四年</p>
<p>今天是我們中華民國抗戰勝利之後第一個國慶日，到了今天，我們終於實現了最後勝利的目標，前雪過去重重的恥辱，迎接未來無究的希望。我們今後更應該羣策羣力，同心同德，以促建國的成功。我們全國同胞工作的目標，只有一個，就是「建國第一」。因之我當今日要提出有關建設的三個重要的方針，與我全國同胞共相策勵。</p>
<p>第一，經濟建設的方針——在增進社會福利以提高人民生活爲目的。</p>
<p>第二，文化建設的方針——在獎進科學研究保障學術自由，並改造社會的風氣。</p>
<p>第三，政治建設的方針——在普及民權的行使，以鞏固憲政的基礎。</p>
<p>上述三項，乃是今後建設的方針，但根本之計，還在國民的心理建設與精神改造。大家必須知道我們國家在戰前是缺乏基礎，在戰時是備遭破壞，更須知道世界是在飛躍的進步，時代是在不斷的前進。我們務必認識復員決不能是復原，而勝利決不是休息，。我們要在戰爭廢墟之上進行非常的建設，要在重建戰後社會的時機，徹底實行三民主義，就必須遵奉國父心理建設知難行易的地敎訓，振奮我們民族鐵路藍褸衝破一切艱難的固有精神。</p>
<p>三十五年</p>
<p>我國自辛亥革命以來，到今天已滿三十三年了。我們國民革命的事業，在此三十五年之間，前後相比實際是在進步前進之中，然而國民革命最後成功的距離，自然　是很遼遠。</p>
<p>我在去年今日，曾經說明今後工作，是「建國第一」。我們國民革命的目的是在實行三民主義，建立平等獨立自由的中華民國，而建國的基本條件，是國家的統一與社會的安定，社會秩序如果不能安定，則人民生命財產，不能獲得保障，農工生產自然無同發達，而人民生活水凖更無從提高，同時國家統一如果不能鞏固，則內亂必至頻仍，民主基礎自然無法建立，而建國事業亦無從着手，所以政府當前對時局的方針，是以保障國家的統一爲第一。並循和平的途徑，以求統一。我們知道國家統一的最低條件，乃是軍令與政令的統一，欲求軍令的統一，必須實行軍隊國家化，建立全國性的軍隊，欲求政令的統一，必須國家的法令制度，能够推行於全國，祛除地方的割據，如果一國之內，有兩個對立的軍隊，地方的政治形成割據的局勢，那就不能稱爲統一的國家。</p>
<p>所以我們今日要爭取和平，必須鞏固國家的統一，可以說今日中國沒有統一，就沒有和平，而統一乃是和平的唯一條件，這一條件如被否認，或遭破壞，不但延長人民的痛苦，且將引致國家的危亡，這是每個人民切身利害生死的關鍵，也就是政府無可旁貸的責任，政府對於阻碍統一，企圖分裂的叛變，自不能熟視無覩，而全國同胞對於危害國家脈，新喪民命的禍亂，更不能袖手旁觀，置國家民族於萬刦不復之地</p>
<h3>八十年來之中國航運</h3>
<p>— 徐學禹</p>
<p>中國航業之發軔及初期之競爭</p>
<p>自吾國有史以來，水上交通，皆恃木舟及帆船。直到遜清同治十一年（西曆一一七二年，距今七十五年前），在當時北洋大臣李鴻章氏積極推進之下，創立輪船招商局，國人經營輪船運輸，由茲嚆矢，在此時期；英·美·法·俄·瑞典及挪威諸國航商，根據條約（一八四二）及天津條約（一八五八），先後將其輪船駛入吾國近海及內河，國人因感輪船快捷穩妥，樂於乘用，洋人藉此獲利不貲，並以其所得購取我國物資，運回外國。同時我舊有木船舢舨，亦日被淘汰，民船因苦。當時愛人士，惄然憂之，是亦爲華商創辦輪船公司之前因也。</p>
<p>同治四年（一八六五）曾國藩設江南造船廠於上海，是爲國人自辦造船廠之始，招商局創立時（一八七二），該廠已造成商船四艘。而內閣學士宋晋奏稱造船糜費太重，請予停止，上諭李鴻章左宗棠通盤籌劃，李氏以爲製造輪船，可禦外侮，利商旅，未可裁撤，並奏官船工竣後即招商承租應用，藉利航運，復裕庫收，是年夏；李鴻章令朱其昂酌擬輪船章程，同年十二月十六日招商局在滬正式開局關防上鐵篆文「總辦輪船招商公局關防」十字，先向英商購入「伊登」輪一艘，另訂購「代勃來開」及「利運」二艘。最早航綫，北達天津·塘沽·南抵香港·廣州·西對長崎·神戶·而以上海爲中心，自此以後；招商局在官　商辦之制度下，船隻且爲政府供差，艱苦經營，並岡勵進。</p>
<p>招商局開辦時最大之勁敵，即爲英商「太古洋行」及美商「旗昌洋行」，「太平洋行」係英商「中國航業公司」八六七年（早於招商局五年），招商局設立時，該行在華船舶噸位已達十萬噸，兼營之我客貨運輸。「旗昌洋行」及美商「花旗航業公司」遠東經理人，在華設爲一八六九年，招商局設立時，該行亦擁有船舶六萬噸，且在長江南北擁有船舶六萬噸，且在長江南北洋各碼頭購有大量地產。另有「怡和洋行」，乃英商「印度航業公司」之遠東經理人，在華設行幾興招商局同時，其他尚有美商「提督輪船公司」，英商「大英輪船公司」及「戊典公司」，法商「法蘭西火輪公司」·德「漢堡輪船公司」，瑞典之「維昌公司」，皆隨意將輪只駛入吾國近海，偶爾如有客貨可載，亦兇攬之以駛入長江內河，但後述之其他各國輪船公司，並未在華另設行局，是以招商局創辦時，誠有如一幼弱之兒童並立於羣眾成人之問，而欲奪取諸成人之地位也。太古，旗昌，怡和，爲恐招商局發揚光大，待招商局開辦後，該洋行等一再减其運價以招攬生意，但該洋行等自相傾軋，頗感不易維持，美商旗昌洋行亦因跌價致賠累不堪，於光緒三年（一八七七），甘願退讓，將其自有上海及各埠之房地產業與輪船等，作價售與招商局，自此該局聲勢益壯，而英商太古洋行忌之益深，再予减價以事競爭，招商局一度幾難維持，幸李鴻章氏重加整頓及鼓勵，並下論全國漕米必須用招商局船舶載運，並减免稅銀，該局方得繼續營業。李鴻章氏對當時國人經營輪運竭力扶持，可稱中國航運最早之保姆，誠當時官僚中唯一開明賢達之人才。而該局總辦盛宣懷氏設法收併旗昌洋行，購入大小船只，遇事躬親料理，其功績僅次於李氏也。</p>
<p>招商局在李氏扶植之下，傾全力與列強航商競爭，至光緒二十六年（一九〇〇），已立定基礎。除在全國通航各地購置有大量房地產業並修建有倉庫碼頭外，且擁有大小船舶二十餘艘。是時帳面資產已達九百五十八萬七千兩，便以餘利開發唐山，東流，宣誠，萍鄉四煤礦，復大量投資創立中國通商銀行（光緒二十二年該行創立時招商局投資八十萬兩，佔當時商股三分之一。）</p>
<p>光緒卅一年（一九〇五），張騫，張　創立「大達輪船公司」，資本六十萬兩，設總公司於上海，初購輪船一艘，專事航行長江，是國人設立輪船公司之第二家。步其後塵者；有（一）虞和德等供應商宣統元年至民初年彰創設之「寗紹輪船公司」·「三北輪船公司」及「鴻安輪船公司」·該三公司之輪船，航行於長江及上海，寗波一帶，總公司均設於上海。（二）張本政·張本才二人合辦之「政記輪船公司」，設總公司於烟台，航綫爲天津·秦皇島·營口·大連及威海衛等地，乃北洋方面當時最大之航運公司，（三）北洋方面復有李序園君創設之「直東輪船公司」及東三省省辦之「東北航務局」，（四）長江及華南方面復有鄭効三創設之「北方輪船公司」及陸伯鴻創設之「大通輪船公司」。至民國十年前後，輪船公司之設立有如雨後春筍，羣起生長，此中原因，半固係國人不願資金外流因而創立航運以敵洋商，而第一次世界大戰，甚多洋商船隻被各該政府調回運用，且吾國先未加入戰圈，物資輸出甚夥，亟需運輸工具，吾國航業因而愈趨發達焉。</p>
<p>日本帝國因鄰近吾國，觀諸英·美在吾國經營航運獲利甚鉅，亦不甘落後，於一九〇七年創立日灣汽船株式會社，總公司設於東京。該公司爲大阪商船株式會社。六東汽船會社·日本郵船會社及港南汽船會社合組而成，自該公司在清末（一九〇七）成立後，吾國航業又多一雄大之勁敵羣。　（下接二十版）</p>

<h3>辛亥革命始末</h3>
<p>辛亥十月十日，武昌起義，推翻清室，肇建共和，迄今已歷三十六年。</p>
<p>此後每逢此一年一度之國慶佳節，必有盛大^^之紀念。而關於辛亥革命事蹟，</p>
<p>文字記載亦多。夫報紙文字，在當時為新聞，事後即成史料。^就申報三十六年前所載有關文字，輯為辛亥革命紀念，以為國慶日之紀念。</p>
<p>辛亥十月十日，武昌革命黨人約同新軍起事。十日晚九時，工程第八營兵工，因未曾領得槍械子彈，認為清吏歧視，藉　鼓噪，　起響應，與旗人發生衝突，雙方轟擊半小時。未幾，蔓延各營，總聲以下各衙門，全為炮彈之的，電報局及各營房，皆遭焚毀。清提督張彪，正擬率隊出衙指揮，為新軍^擊傷，清鄂督瑞徵,倉猝避入軍艦。武昌即為革命軍所佔領，揭開辛亥革命之序幕。</p>
<p>革命軍原定在十月七日起事動，乃改在九日起事。詎意九日，漢口俄租界捕得革命黨二人探知越在半夜，武漢兩地同時起事。清鄂督在九日夜九時許接得漢口江漢關電　,即行戒備，緊閉城門，嚴查行人。當夜在小朝徵安徽　龍及襄陽學　內搜出炸藥數十顆，革命黨被逮捕者二十多人，彭澤藩等三人，即遭處死。此為辛亥革命武昌起義前夕，革命黨人受之打擊。</p>
<p>革命黨人之起義，已非一次。一八九五年廣州之役，一九零零年惠州之役，一九零四年長萍之役，一九零六年安慶之役，一九零七年　南關之役與　，及　黃花崗之役，廣仆　起、其勇　精進，激動人心之力量不小。但革命黨每次起事。往往事前為清吏所發覺，挺破　一次，即有多人遭　。被殺　。自黃花崗起義失敗後，始全力專注意于武漢，既遭破獲，人人惋惜。</p>
<p>武昌革命黨秘密機關破獲後，不得不匆促起事，攻獲武昌，忽然得手，且成為一發不可收拾之勢。此為大家所不及料。從地勢方面講，武漢居全國中心，共南湘粵兩省，乃革命黨根本之地，可以無後顧之憂。川人為鐵路而爭，本無即變之意，但官吏一意孤行，妄加殺戮，民怨已深。今革命軍既得武昌，阻斷援軍入川之路，同時所受怨憤，乘機暴發，川事更難即定。至於長江下遊各省，人心早已見背，雖不即起事，亦無來助之理，故革命軍雖只得武昌一城，全國已呈動搖之勢。</p>
<p>武昌起義，自新兵倡議開始，蔓延各營甚速。守衛督署之砲兵，亦　白布，在頭門外向內開槍，未幾，王府口正衙火起，與督署相近，清吏大恐。瑞徵及其眷屬，喬裝出走。其時砲馬兩標已從保安門　山門衝入，沿途喊殺震天。各處火起，熊熊如同白晝。各衙門或受砲中，或遭火焚，旗人被殺者不少，警察亦脫衣棄帽而逃。一夜混亂，各衙門均為革命軍所佔有。所有清吏，即未逃出城外　，亦躲藏民房之中。未起事之軍隊，曾閱革命軍在通湘門，千　，　等處接觸，自十日至十二日，槍砲之聲不絕。</p>
<p>革命軍一面安定武昌，一面　多人至漢口，佔據大智門。漢口　界　徒，聞武昌起事，到處縱火，延燒甚烈。革命黨人將火救熄，隨即佔領華界，出示安民，漢口防軍亦降。黨人初擬佔大智門江岸車站，燬壞鐵路，阻止北軍南下，適有汴軍　營，約一萬二千人開到，與革命黨在江岸車站一帶交戰。時漢口尚有各國租界，革命黨對於外人，竭力保護，通告不許傷及外人及外國義勇隊。頗博得各國同情，故各國皆嚴守中立。</p>
<p>漢陽旋亦為革命軍所佔領，漢陽知府出走，漢陽兵工廠又為革命軍所得，獲取軍械無數。</p>
<p>民軍佔領武昌時之漢陽門</p>
<p>革命黨佔領武漢武漢三鎮後，一面嚴密佈置，從事抵抗，在武昌蛇山龜山等處，加築砲台以便射擊江中兵艦。在漢口又破壞鐵路路軌及橋樑。派隊潛赴信陽關，抗　北軍。一面復從事地方秩序之恢復。地方事件，交與　議局主持，鳴　通告商店開市營業，禁止乘機搶劫，擾亂治安，保護外人，更為週密。武漢漸漸安定。</p>
<p>當瑞徵避入軍艦後，即電上海清海軍門薩鎮冰，命其駕艦來漢，薩鎮冰乃率三艦上駛漢口，在武漢江面開戰，大兵艦一艘，為革命軍所擊沉其餘兩艘亦傷。旋因漢口各國領事，因租界在火線內，十分危險，向清外務部聲明，於是退至下遊。其實海軍一部份，早已投入革命黨，故均向天開砲，而革命軍在蛇山龜山所架之砲，則瞄射甚準也。</p>
<p>以革命黨與清廷比，清廷有兩鎮，又有各省協助，而革命黨之兵力，不及一鎮，清廷似有可勝之勢。但革命軍能協力同心，一致奮起，而清廷之兵，新軍甚多，一部份已投向革命黨，不入革命黨者，在開火時，亦不力戰。且武漢義旗一舉，四方響應，遠到齊燕，近到湘汴，以及川江，兩浙，嶺海，雲貴，皆有遙遙欲動之勢。同時滿洲官吏，一聞革命黨之風聲，唯恐逃避不及，　守城如敝履，真有風聲鶴唳，草木皆兵之慨。革命黨順天應時，故易成事耳。</p>
<p>不及三日革命黨已佔有武漢三鎮。消息傳至北京，清廷大為愕然，不知所措。即以陛軍大臣蔭昌　率陸軍南下，　與薩鎮冰之水師相會和。後見形勢日　緊張，各省紛紛謠傳獨立，人心見背，乃復起用袁世凱為兩湖總督，以岑春煊為四川總督，以收拾人心，安定政局，然為時晚矣。</p>
<p>當蔭昌尚未統率大軍南下之時，革命軍已派兵至　揚州，準備攔擊北軍。十七日，汴軍與革命軍相遇於鄂邊境，小小交鋒，擊退汴軍。其時汴軍靜待蔭昌援軍到來，故亦未取攻勢。</p>
<p>至十月下旬，蔭昌首批軍隊，已越信陽而抵武勝關。革命軍分頭迎擊，大獲全勝，北追五十馀里，佔領武勝關，於隧道口安置大砲四尊，阻截南北通路。旋蔭昌大軍開到，馮國璋之援軍又至，革命軍乃不支後退。廿八日漢口大智門，劉家廟一帶，復為北軍所據。漢口既失，革命軍退守武昌。兩軍在武漢相持一月，至十一月下旬，漢陽又為北軍所攻入，武昌亦岌岌可危。</p>
<p>革命軍在武漢，受北軍壓迫，節節失利，然其勢力則隨時在擴張中，溯江西上，進入四川。川省在鐵路風潮之後，民心頗為激昂，而川省新軍，大多傾向革命，革命軍遂獲得一部份新力量。乃遣軍南下，長沙，岳陽相繼而得。一面復在長沙下遊一帶活動，克九江，佔安慶，順流東下，南京為軍事必爭之地，清督張人駿目武昌起義後，已調集江防營分駐要隘。</p>
<p>十一月八日，新軍攻雨花台失利，退守鎮江。適　浙援軍至，乃推徐紹楨為聯軍司令，反攻南京。廿三日，與張動之兵接戰，跌獲勝利。十二月二日，佔領雨花台，從太平門攻入。張人駿張動遁逃，南京光復。</p>
<p>武昌義旗一舉，各省均呈動搖，新軍紛紛起事，各省省長先後宣佈獨立。十月初二日，革命軍進佔九江，南昌震搖。卅一日，新軍協統吳介璋獨立，清撫馬汝揆自殺。四安於廿四日起義，太原，　南均於三十日起義。上海則於十一月三日，由陳英士率領發難，先據閘北警局，又次佔製造局，亦告光復，翌日，蘇浙桂，黔，　，隴諸省紛紛均起。天津保定，也屢有失守之說。其時十八行省，除汴省為戰區外，馀均捲入革命軍漩渦之中。</p>
<p>武漢軍事，清廷雖佔勝利，但南京已為革命黨所有，即復武漢，亦雖　事。且各省紛紛獨立，大勢已去，無法挽回。乃下詔罪巳，　親貴，命袁世凱組閣。罪已詔調：「朕用人無方，失治寡術，政地多用親貴，則與　章，路　以　壬，則動遠與諭。促行新政，而官紳或藉為綱利之圖，更改舊制，而權　或　為自便之計。民財之取已多，而未辦一利民之事。司法之詔屢下，而實無一守法之人。馴至積怨於下而朕不知，禍迫於前朕不覺。」云云。於是一面議和。一面進行組織臨時政府。翌年一月一日，臨時政府成立，二月十二日，清帝發佈退位詔書。辛亥革命至此完成。</p>
<p>辛亥革命，自十月十日武昌起義，至清帝下詔退位，前後僅一百二十六日，事機之速，為革命史中所僅見。是固清吏昏庸，朝政腐敗，以致民心見背。然不經歷次轟轟烈烈之犧牲，亦決無如此之神速也。</p>
<h3>國號國璽考</h3>
<p>清室退位，南北議和之時，對於革命後新國家的正式名稱問題，各人主張紛紜，莫裹一是，如「中華共和國」，「大中華民國」，「大漢國」，「大漢民國」等等。後來參議員成立，乃正式將「中華民國」的稱號。定為法案。國學大師革命前輩章太炎先生，就是竭力主張用「中華民國」這個名稱的。他在那時　的民報上，曾撰「中華民國解」文、廣徵博引，舉　理由甚多。</p>
<p>關於國璽，第一個國璽究為誰人所　，已不可考。但今日國民政府用的國璽，則是國父在廣州任大元帥時所刻。此國璽為老坑玉，文曰「中華民國之璽」，高二寸七分，方廣二寸六分，當時　琢玉名匠陸某人　之，給工資八千元，並會委任元帥府秘書通聲海為璽官，司理其事。</p>

<h3>上海光復記</h3>
<p>辛亥革命的成功，上海的光復是一個極重要的關鍵。</p>
<p>我們假使翻一翻中華民國的開國革命史，這道理便很淸楚了。武昌起義，在一九一一年十月十日的晚上，上海的光復，在同年十一月三日——武昌之役後二十四天。上海原是策動革命的中心地，並且又是南北海陸運輸的綰　，中外交通的要隘，除在政治，文化，敎育，經濟，財政，工商上佔着極重要的位置以外，在軍事上更爲必爭之地。革命軍光復上海以後，在軍火上，餉精上，可以得到種種便利。而且，上海的光復，發動在江浙兩省之前，這時武漢三鎭，重被淸軍佔領，因此當時指揮革命的大木營，已從武淡移到了上海。其後江浙兩省義勇軍的發動，南京的攻克，和中華民國臨時政府的成立，無一不是由上海方面來策動一切。所以，上海的光復，在辛亥革命史上，是佔着極光榮，極重要的一頁的。</p>
<p>今天，趁這民國三十六年的雙十佳節，我們想把上海光復始末，作一個系統的叙述。</p>
<p>領導者——陳英士</p>
<p>當淸來政綱日隳，外患迭起，而革命思潮正在萌芽的時候，上海已是鼓吹革命的中心。這原因是，上海有着租界，言論比較不受拘束，如章太炎，蔡元培等所辦的愛國學社，徐錫麟，秋瑾等所辦的光復社，都在當時鼓吹排滿，極露鋒芒的，對於民心——尤其學生及其他智識份子，當然有極大的影響。雖然其間也受過不小的挫折，像「蘇報」案，便是革命史上頗爲著名的大獄。</p>
<p>關於這些英勇的可歌可泣的事蹟，說來話長，在這裏我們不想再爲追記。這裏只就對於光復上海直接有關的事蹟，加以追述</p>
<p>一開始便應該提到陳英士。——他是光復上海的領導者，也是中華民國開國史上的偉人。</p>
<p>陳英士，名其美，浙江吳興人。他在民國紀元前六年，在東京加入同盟會，後又入東斌學校，習軍事學。紀元前三年，從日本返國，開始着手上海黨務工作。曾糾合同志，在上海創辦「中國日報」及「民聲叢報」，作爲革命的言論機關，又在馬霍路德福里設立秘密事務所，江浙革命同志到上海來，大都駐在那裏，互相聯絡。</p>
<p>第二年，會務大振，陳氏約江浙同志在事務所商議大舉計劃，不料被在座在的革命黨人劉光漢出賣了大家，把消息密吿淸吏端方，端方照會租界當局，搜查德福里事務所。陳氏出外得免。褚輔成，周淡游等喬裝工人逃出，只有張恭一人，被當局所逮捕，移禁南京監獄。經此事變，江浙大舉計劃，遂以中輟。</p>
<p>中部同盟會</p>
<p>一九一〇年六月，辛亥革命的上一年，在日本的同盟會同志，集會討論展開革命工作，宋敎仁建議組織「中部同盟會」，來策動長江各省的革命工作。宋氏當時便來滬與陳英士等同志策劃進行。到翌年（辛亥年）二月中旬，「中部同盟會」才逐漸組織就緒，閏六月初六日假湖州曾館召開「中部同盟會」成立大會，到會同志共三十三人，公推宋敎仁，陳英士，譚人鳳等主持會務，議定由江蘇，浙江，安徽，江西，湖北，湖南，四川，陝西八省聯合舉義，各省分頭進行。</p>
<p>「中部同盟會」成立以後，樞紐。是年九月中旬，湖北省軍界同志令派居正等到上海講辦手繪等軍火，並擬邀請宋敎仁，黃興等到漢口去主持一切。居正等到了上海，便在馬霍路陳英士的秘密事務所內開會討論，決定在南京，上海和武漢同時發動起義，並派員到香港去請黃克强到漢口主持。但尙未佈置就緒，湖北省的革命同志已急不欲待的在武昌高舉旗了——這便是三十六年前的今天，著名的武昌起義。於是黃克强，宋敎仁，居正等便由上海趕往湖北去，共　軍政。而陳英士等則留在上海，聯絡南京，鎭江，杭州各地防軍，起義響應。</p>
<p>「九一三」起義</p>
<p>武昌起義以後，上海民心極爲激昂。下面一段小故事，便可說明當時人心一斑；</p>
<p>由於上海人士關心武昌義軍行動，本報在當時特地另外發行午報，將有關革命起事的新聞，儘先向讀者報導。一次報館裏接到記者來電，報吿馮國璋由漢口奪回漢陽，這當然是一個對民軍不利的消息，當下載入午報內。不料才由報販在館外呌賣，便有一大羣義民擁入報館，指爲造謠。民軍勝則喜，民軍敗則憤，甚至怪到報館頭上來，民氣如此，已是革命成功的預兆了。</p>
<p>在上海的革命黨人，此時認爲時機成熟，籌備起義。一方面，上海士商自己組織的上海商團，也起而嚮應，與民軍方面密切聯絡。農曆九月十一日（十一月一日）、商團在九畝地舉行大檢閱，參加的有二千餘人。各商團會長並在南市救火會開會，由李平書主席，（現在城隍廟湖心中建有他的銅像，以資景仰，）當下約定：如聽到救火會鐘樓鳴鐘，先九下，後十三下，商團即分段出防，暗含九月十三日嚮應革命之意。十二日晚，上海道劉襄蓀已獲得這一個消息，急得走頭無路，連忙電呈南京督署，報吿上海革命黨起事，商團全數叛變。於是在十三日黎明，南京督署下令南京松江兩路進兵，直趨上海，並識「不論民軍商團，捕獲者一律正法」。</p>
<p>這時，民重和商團已處於「箭在弦上，不得不發」的形勢，當日下午，閘北巡警首先發動。五時，民軍臂纏白布，戎裝荷槍，列隊入城，張貼安民吿示，夜十時進攻道縣署，上海道劉襄蓀早已逃進租界，縣令田發榮也出走，城內遍懸白旗，商店照常營業。正在這時候，救火會警鐘大鳴，各商團知道事已成熟，全體出防，上海縣城便這麼閭閻安堵，七　不　的，入於民軍之手了。</p>
<p>同時，陳英十因僞已和製造局一部份防軍聯絡成功，便率領民軍敢死隊進攻，不料局中另一部份防軍出而堅拒。陳氏下令暫停進攻親自跑進製造局，向那些堅拒的兵士們演說勸導，誰知竟被捉去，用鐵鍊鎖在柱上。民軍隨即開始猛烈攻擊，商團方面也派商團兩隊馳往援助，一面派人入局勸局內防軍作內應，果然有內棧私將砲門卸下送出。攻到大明，終於佔領全局，把陳英士援救出險；而上海也全部光復了。</p>
<p>血戰製造局</p>
<p>關於攻打製造局，當時本報有着極詳許細的紀載。這裏摘錄的是辛亥九月十四日的本報新聞：</p>
<p>本埠特別耙事；昨日五點鐘，革命軍得滬軍營，五點一刻攻製造局，八點鐘佔領上海城，民間毫無驚擾。先是三點鐘時，有民國軍二百餘人，排隊過滬軍營，兩方兵士各舉手加額爲禮，未幾營中即扯民國軍旗。「民國軍既至製造局，有敢死隊一百廿人，先行衝入，身穿白色軍服，袖鑲紅錢，並無軍械，徒手進攻。先由敢死隊領袖一人，將炸彈　放門內，其聲甚巨；旋由民軍向衆演說，彼此均係同胞，並不傷犯，幸勿見拒，並謂張某已允讓出等語。詎局中防駐之砲隊營及巡警兵等出爲抵抗，立放排槍，民軍米有準備，致受槍傷八人。敢死隊領袖施放炸彈時，自傷手臂，現已送往上海醫院醫治，聞防兵亦受傷多人。是時民軍知不可理喻，遂用死力攻擊，將局園住，繼復退至望道橋地方，徐圖進攻。』十四日本報的耙載，由於截稿時間的限制，只能到此爲止。翌晨本報第一版，復有攻打製造局的續聞；</p>
<p>『……黎明時，民軍復至製造局，計有敢死隊二百餘人，滬軍營兵數百人，分作兩隊，向前後門夾攻。其攻前門者，迫至二門，守軍兵士，踞一樓上放槍，彈落如雨，民軍勇往直前，亦向上放槍拒之，約兩小時。民軍立意不欲傷人，故未多帶子彈，斯時子彈將罄，而局兵猶放槍不絕，敢死隊趨往滬軍營，拖來格林砲兩尊，開十餘發，有一彈向屋面轟去，局兵尙不肯退，民軍聲言往取火油焚樓，於是局兵始懼，紛紛逃潰。其時攻擊後門之民軍，因無路可入，由滬軍營開一排槍，將後壁轟開一洞，於是一癬而進，敢死隊先擲放炸彈，滬軍營兵開槍繼之，異常奮勇，局兵見兩面攻入，知　抵禦，始向軍前投降。聞局中軍火異當充足，民軍大爲喜悅。……」</p>
<p>這次血戰，本報在十五日的社評「滬南製造局之戰」，中也加以評論，對革命黨人的奮不願身，深加　揚。</p>
<p>事實上，這次血戰，的確充份戈現出革命者的勇氣和精神。民軍當子彈垂竭，死亡相枕之際，而衆無退志，終於以最後五分鐘的堅忍，而獲得成功，豈是德倖？有一個參加革命的靑年學生，腦部已中槍彈，血流滿面，還奪不顧身，把衣服撕下來自裏創孔，荷槍猛呼，向前直衝，這種精神，又豈是目下的一般貪生怕死之徒所能望其萬一！</p>
<p>光復以後</p>
<p>革命軍進佔上海的情形，上面已約略提及，這裏再爲詳細記</p>
<p>索性再抄舊報：——（辛亥九月十四日本報）</p>
<p>『昨日午後五點鐘時，有民國軍四五十人，戎服佩刀，列隊進小東門，即在各城門及長生橋堍電桿上懸掛吿示一道，巡警等均不敢攔阻，其文錄下：照得武昌起義　同胞萬衆一心凡我養旗所指　罔不踴躍歡迎各省民城恢復　從未妨害安寗上海東南巨埠　通商世界聞名一經大兵雲集　損害自必未輕今奉軍政府命　但今各界輸誠茲已紛紛歸誠　俱見敵懷同情惟願親愛同胞　仍各安分營生洋人生命財產　切勿乘此相侵轉瞬民國成立　人人共享太平</p>
<p>『晚八點鐘，又有民國軍一隊，約二十餘人，荷槍列隊入城，持紅色白色民國軍旗各一面，紛向四處要道粘貼安民示文，城門上亦一律懸掛白旗及軍旗　營時城內並無抵抗者，故秩序甚安靜，市間各店亦仍照常交易，毫無驚擾，而上海城「失守」矣！』（餘略）</p>
<p>農曆九月十六日（十一月六日）——光復後的第三天，各起義同志在小東門內海防廳內開會，組織上海軍政府，推舉陳英士爲滬軍都督，那時駐在吳淞的粵軍濟字營也已開始反正。十七日，陳英士委派伍廷芳爲外交總長，沈懋昭爲財政總長。十八日，民政總長又委　　爲上海縣民政長，黃慶潮爲上海縣司法長，莫錫綸爲市長，圍艘桂爲副市憂，改原有的「城自治公所」爲「市政廳」，同時滬軍都督府又委李顯謨爲滬防水陸全軍統領。滬軍都督府，這時成為上海革命的最高軍政當局。</p>
<p>上海光復以後，江浙各地義軍也紛紛起義。農曆九月十五日蘇州民軍起義；二十一日鎭江起義，海軍兵艦也跟着嚮應；二十二日，江陰砲台表示一致行動，二十五日，滬軍向南京進攻，二十六日，浙江民軍響應，聯合進攻；十月初五日，蘇州，杭州，上海，鎭江各路軍隊會師攻打南京，向月十二日便將南京攻下，淸廷處於地位惡劣，不得不屈服求和了。</p>
<p>寫到這裏，已把上海光復的前前後後，大概的敘述完全，這篇「上海光復記」也可以結束了。但是，我們在於後還要特別提起光復上海的滬軍都督陳英士，和參加光復，　績彪炳的上海商團領袖李平書以及商團的團員們</p>
<p>滬軍都督府到民國元年七月，因陳英士　職而取銷，當時袁世凱已做了臨時大總統，大勢已無可為。民國二年討袁軍興，是年七月十八日陳氏又設駐滬討袁軍總司令部於南市，不幸失敗。民國四年袁氏稱帝，翌年五月十八日，陳英士竟遭袁氏爪牙　算，在上海被剌殞命。</p>
<p>上海商團的團員們，光復了自己的家鄕以後，嗣後江南幾次戰役，也都湧踴參加，國父在南京就職時，商團曾任禁衛軍。但是到袁世凱當政以後，也不得不全團解散了。</p>
<p>但是，他們雖然死的死了，散的散了，他們的功績，他們的精神，是應該永遠銘刻在每個上海人的心上的。</p>
<p>今天，在這舉國歡騰的節日中，我們懷念着光復上海的革命巨人，懷念着三十六年前無數烈士的壯烈犧牲，是太使我們興奮了！身爲上海人，是應該如何繼承着先烈的精神，來貢獻給自己的家鄉呢？</p>

<h3>八十年來之中國航運（上接第十七）</h3>
<p>戰前航權之喪失及所受之影響</p>
<p>抗戰前吾國航權之喪失，始於遜淸道光廿二年（一八四二)之中英江寗條約，其第二款云：「准英國人民帶同所屬家眷，寄居沿海之廣州，福州，夏門，甯波，上海五處港口，貿易通商無礙」，及道光廿三年（一八四三)中英吾貿易章程附貼條款之第四款：「其英商貿易處所祇准在吾」，遜淸政府殊不知航權之重要，當時對英人往返旣無限制，准其貿易，客貨兼帶在所不免，而沿海貿易一事雖無正式條文規定，而事實上因吾國之放任政策於此輩英商極爲有利，是以自江寗條約之結訂，吾國沿海之貿易，即淪入西人之手矣。</p>
<p>長江航權之喪失，則始於咸豐八年，（一八五八)中英續約之第十款規定：「長江一帶英商俱可通商」，在咸豐十「年(一八六一)復有長江通商章程，是時遜淸政府，事實上已允許洋商在上海及長江各口往來進輸土貨，自是而後；英商船隻，竟充斥江上，長江航權，由茲喪失！</p>
<p>光緒廿一年(一八九五)中日馬關條約之結訂，准日輪駛往沙市，重慶，蘇州，杭州，並允其附搭旅客，裝運貨物，外輪由此駛入吾國內港，閱二年，巾英緬甸條約，又准英輪前往華南各埠——西江，梧州，廣州停泊，一切按長江通商章程同樣辦理，到光緒廿八年（一九〇二)，外輪航行權已遍達吾國沿海，華南及長江上下游一帶，日演而廣，迄光緒廿九年（一九〇三），中日通商行船續約，允日輪除航行長江各埠外，亦可往來東三省及烟台各內港，外輪勢力，乃由華中南面　至吾國東北部矣。</p>
<p>上述各不平等條約結構之先；外人因深知遜淸政府極爲　預僅注意稅　而不知何所謂航行權，且諸官吏中甚多以為外輪來　足以助吾發達商務，皆足以促成外國航商先則試行侵佔，造成旣成事實，逾越時日，積非成是，過有機會——如吾國戰敗於外國之時，即乘後逼迫吾國訂入約章，便成合法權利。因此；民國成立以來，我國航業始終未振，國際貿易更不堪言，西人將我土貨攫購回國，而以其製成品運來傾銷，中國已成世界各國逐鹿之塲；吾國生權，國防，交通，經濟莫不被侵凌，若非此次抗戰，恐今日之中國已成爲十年前之印度矣！</p>
<p>抗戰時期之航運</p>
<p>吾國積弱，久爲强鄰日本所洞悉，九一八事變後，日敵更欲用其陸海空軍全部武力，迫我滅亡。吾國一忍再忍，不得不良作準備，與其一拼。航業方面；政府先從招商局整頓入手，於廿一年十月，收該局爲國營，次年五月，利用中英庚款三十六萬鎊定造海輪四艘，江輪三艘。廿三年六月，公佈船員檢定章程，嗣再訓練大批人員，派往國營民營一千噸以上之輪上，研究航務。且在長江各地，存放油料，以備不時之需，四川省形勢險要，水道縱橫，計劃作爲抗戰中心，由交通部飭招商局，民生公司等趕造淺水輪等，用資準備行駛川江，惜招商局所建之淺水輪，工程未竣，而滬戰已起矣！</p>
<p>抗戰前夕，吾國僅看輪船六十萬噸，更以海軍力薄，不能保護運輸，惟有力圖保存，以免資敵，且維後方運輸，廿六年八月—中日對持，情勢益惡。交通郁秘電各航商，將所有海輪儘速駛入長江，其不能駛入者，則往香港，滬戰發生後除有海輪十四艘因不及逃避終淪入敵手外，餘均保全，迨武漢形勢緊張，復由交通部漢口航政局會同軍事運輸機構督促輪船再行西撤，計退宜昌者二〇八艘，退長沙六十六艘，退常德者十六艘，其未在上述撤退數字之內者，則臨時應變，自沉於港口，以為阻塞工具——抗戰初七，輪只為完成此項任務，數達八十七艘，重爲十一萬噸，全國航商，無不深明大義，不顧損失，慷慨應徵，是倭寇艦隊，不能西上之主因也，撤退各輪，則負搶運物資之重責，搶運詳細數量，因爲時至急，並未詳爲統計，僅就招商局而言，自廿六年八月十四日起至廿八年底止，共運公物八萬八千噸，商貨十九萬噸，民生公司在自廿六年八月始至廿九年底止，共運兵工器材及公物二十餘萬噸，長江上游水度旣淺，而各航業員工於千辛萬苦之中，努力工作，其精神殊可欽佩至極。</p>
<p>此次抗戰，除政府征用輸隻阻塞水道作消極之抵抗外，其因其他原因損失者，列表如後。（參看：抗戰中損失船舶噸數簡表)</p>
<p>抗戰中損失船舶</p>
<p>數簡表</p>
<p>軍事徵用充作阻塞工作者　一一九，九八六·五〇噸</p>
<p>軍公運輸中途被炸燬者　一五，八九一·〇〇噸</p>
<p>被敵擄扣者　一一一，〇〇六·〇〇噸</p>
<p>被敵炸沉炸毀者　四九，三五七·七四噸</p>
<p>共計　二九六，二四一·二四噸</p>
<p>綜諸上述，抗戰前夕，吾國有船舶不過六十萬噸。而因抗戰直接受損者，近三十萬噸，已達一半，其中因軍事徵用充作阻塞工作之用而損失者，已由我政府撥給巨款，派定專員赴美訂購新輪賠與各受損之航商，以事補償焉。</p>

<h3>八十年來之上海市公用事業</h3>
<p>— 趙曾珏</p>
<p>一：導言公用事業實爲與人民日常生活息息相關之公衆服務，故如鐵路，公路，航運，郵電，等莫不屬於公用事業範圍，惟因其含有全國性，故均歸諸國營，而近代通稱之公用事業，則大都就狹義的而言，即凡一地方的給水，電力，煤氣，電話，陸上交通，碼頭倉庫，路燈摽準　等均屬之。</p>
<p>上海市之公用事業，　始於前淸同治年閒，經營最早者爲英法兩商，次爲美商，國人急起直追，亦於光緒年間，分別興辦，規模大備，駕乎全國各大都市之上。試按其創興之先後，刊編年表如次：</p>
<p>淸同治五年（一八六六）　英商上海自來火公司創立，上海之有煤氣燈，煤氣灶自此始。</p>
<p>淸同治十二年（一八七三）　法人米拉（Menard）由日本運入人力軍一輛，同治十三年二月初七日（即一八七四年三月廿四日）法租界公商局核發第一號人力車執照，上海之有人力軍自此始。</p>
<p>淸光緒七年（一八八一）　大北電報公司兼營租界電話上海之有電話自此始。</p>
<p>淸光緒八年（一八八二）　英商自來水公司創立，上海之有自來水自此始。</p>
<p>同年　西商上海電氣公司（即今上海電力公司前身）創立，是為上海有電燈之始。</p>
<p>淸光緒十六年（一八九〇）　公共租界開始應用白熱電燈為路燈，是為上海有電氣路燈之始。</p>
<p>淸光緒廿三年（一八九七）上海南市馬路工程善後局籌辦電燈，是為上海南市有電燈之始。</p>
<p>淸光緒廿七年（一九〇一）匈牙利人李恩時（Leinz）運入汽車二輛，是為上海有汽車之始。</p>
<p>淸光緒廿八年（一九〇二）內地自來水公司開幕，是為上海南市有自來水之始。</p>
<p>同年　上海電量話局成立，是為上海市區有電話之始。</p>
<p>淸光緒卅三年（一九〇七）　內地電燈公司（即今華商電氣公司前身）成立。</p>
<p>同年　法商電車電燈公司成立，兼營自來水及公共運輸，是為上海法租界有水電交通之始。</p>
<p>淸光緒卅四年（一九〇八）　英法商有軌電圜相繼開辦，是為上海有電車之始。</p>
<p>淸宣統二年（一九〇八）　浦東塘工善後局開辦浦江輪渡，是為上海有輪渡之始。</p>
<p>民國二年（一九一三）　華商電車公司開幕，是為上海南市有電車之始。</p>
<p>民國三年（一九一四）　英商上海電車公司開辦無軌電車，是為上海有無軌電車之始。</p>
<p>民國十三年（一九二四）英商上海公共汽車及華商公共汽車公司相繼開幕是為上海市有公共汽車之始。</p>
<p>民國廿六年（一九三七）　市辦浦東自來水廠開幕，是為上海浦東有自來水之始。</p>
<p>至於監理公用事業之行政機構，昔在公共租界爲工部局，在法租界爲公董局。在市區初爲工巡捐局，嗣爲市政廳，顧均爲兼理性質，初無專設之機構。迨民國十六年(一九二七)上海市政府成立，設置公用局，釐訂其職掌，是爲上海有主管公用事業行政機構之始。淮當時租界存在，公用局行使職權，祇限於市區，範圍狹小，事務亦較淸簡。今則租界收回，行政統一，公用局綜理全市公用事業，無論華商，外商，悉在監督指導之列，事繁職重，視前不可同日而需矣。</p>
<p>七七抗戰，淞滬淪陷，上海市各項公用事業備受摧殘，損失慘重。卅四年秋，抗戰勝利，租界收回，公用局隨市政府重建立於斯土，接收整理，規劃復興，分途並進，二年以來，上海各種公用事業漸復原狀，間有突過戰前紀錄者，茲分列報導於后：</p>
<p>二：給水</p>
<p>沿革</p>
<p>淸光緒八年（一八八二）英商上海自來水公司開幕，供給旅居上海外僑，實爲上海給水事業之嚆矢。光緒二十二年（一八九六)法租界公董局自行創辦自來水廠，光緒三十二年（一九〇六)年公董局將該廠及其營業權讓渡與法商電車電燈公司與上海自來水公司劃分營業區域，以洋涇浜爲界。至此第一第二兩特區，始各有自來水廠一家，至國人經營之自來水廠，計有三家，一爲上海內地自來水公司。光緒二十二年曹　等稟准巡道劉　祥籌設，翌年建華廠屋於半淞園，至光緒二十八年(一九〇二)完工放水。二爲閘北水電公司，淸代季年，英商上海自來水公司越界埋設水管，由兩江總督張人駿檄行滬道　借官款，組織閘北水電公司，以保主權，當即建廠於潭子灣（今恒豐路底)宣統三年九月(一九〇九年十月)成立。嗣一度收歸省辦，至民十三年(一九二四)改爲商辦。在股行　　河口剪淞橋地方建築新廠，民國十七年(一九二八)全部完成，以潭子老廠爲分水廠。三爲浦東自來水廠。浦東各區「向無任何給水設備，上海市政府鑒於浦東居民日增，需水股切，令飭公用局籌辦，旋以經費不充，宋能積極進行，民國廿三年(一九三四)十月，由市政府飭由興業信託社籌辦，二十四年(一九三五)九月建廠於浦東游龍路出浦處，二十六年(一九三七)六月工竣，開始給水。</p>
<p>抗戰期內「上海市各自來水廠，除法商自來水公司外，餘均被華中水電公司上海水道支店合併經營，卅四年九月，公用局奉命接收，除浦東自來水廠由公用局繼續經營外，其餘均交還原主</p>
<p>復員　况</p>
<p>敵為佔領時期，對於給水設備，一任敗壞，水池濾沙，多年未換，消毒藥品，恣意减縮，不惟水質混濁，其漏失量亦以水管殘損，達百分之六十以上，市民領用，大受影響，即督促各公司整修水管，漏失量遂遞减至百分之三十左右，同時合同衛生局暨各自來水廠迭次硏討，訂定「上海市飲水淸潔標準」。其主要點爲每公撮（CC)水中細菌不得起過一〇〇個，每公升中大小腸菌不得超過一〇個。其暫時硬度，及永久硬度二數之和，不得超過三〇〇爲準。而就總出水量論，在接收時，平均每日約爲三三〇·〇〇〇立方公尺，至卅六年七月爲五七一·三〇一餘公方公尺，較之戰前最高紀錄，每日給水四五二·〇〇〇餘立方公尺，同已突渦矣。</p>
<p>上海市給水，惟滬西一帶，水量水壓均感不足，發生恐慌現象。公用局爲根本解決起見，籌劃創設滬西自來水公司，惟工程艱鉅，需費浩繁，非一蹴可幾。爲應付目前急需計，乃舉辦滬西給水緊急工程，除令英商上海自來水公司將中山公園西首自　并，膠州路再唧水站自流井，予以恢復，以裕古北路以東，仙霞中正西路以北居民用水外，並在中正西路覓地建築二·〇〇〇立方公尺容量之水池一座，裝設唧機三具，俾　將上海自來水公司饋水三·〇〇〇立方公尺，移供華山路以西，察哈爾路以北，凱旋路以東，中正西路以南，居民之用。惟自江蘇路中山路交點向南沿華山路至古北路一帶，則非另行開鑿自流井，無法補救。當經勘定虹橋路伊犁路口虹橋路林森西路口華山路林森西路口等三處，各開八吋徑自流井一座，每日共可出水二·四〇〇立方公尺。滬西全部緊急工程完成以後，每日可補充水量一一·〇〇〇立方公尺，依照目前每日給水二一·〇〇〇立方公尺，約可增加百分之五十，足以供給六萬人之用水，水荒差堪解決矣。</p>
<p>浦東自來水廠爲配合浦東未來之繁榮，必須擴充設備以應需要。該廠在公用局督導之下，已實行擴充水管，第一期工程計劃，延畏現有幹管，自浦東路六號橋起，經十八間鎭至民生路藍烟囱碼頭，第二步再展至洋涇鎭。對於碼頭給水設施，現正次第完成者，計有招商局第五七八九四碼頭，經濟部上海區燃料管理委員會第三棧，公和祥東西棧，太古浦東棧。華通棧等力處，又爲辦理江心船隻給水，已購得給水船一艘，俟改完竣，即可與各船公司訂約給水。</p>
<p>三：電氣</p>
<p>沿革</p>
<p>上海電氣事業，以淸光緒八年（一八八二）開幕之西商上海電氣公司(今爲美商上海電力公司）爲最早。繼此而起者，爲法商電車電燈公司與國人經營之內地電燈公司，均在淸光緒卅三年（一九〇七）創立。宣統三年（一九〇九），閘北水電公司成立，民國七年(一九一八）內地電燈公司與華商電車公司合併爲華商電氣公司，旣而寶明。浦東·眞如·翔華四電廠亦相繼成立。民國二十年至二十四年間，上海市政府爲解決滬西越界　路供電問題，與美商上海電力公司幾經交涉，於民國廿四年一月四日簽訂設立滬西電力股份有限公司，華資佔股本百分之四十九，餘屬上海電力公司。</p>
<p>淪陷期內，除法商電燈公司外，上海滬西　商閘北浦東等電氣公司，均被敵華中水電公司上海電氣支店强行合併。勝利後，眞如翔華等電廠，均於戰時被毀，已不存在，餘均由公用局協同接收，並即交還原主繼續經營。</p>
<p>復員概况</p>
<p>各電氣公司，經敵為長期侵佔，損失綦重，尤以閘北華商浦東三電氣公司之發電設備，全被拆除，祇能向上海電力公司購電轉售。上海市戰前發電機容量共有二十六萬瓩，接收之初，全市發電量，不過十二萬四千　，不足戰前之半數，電源奇絀，供不應求，市民備感痛苦。公用局協同接收之後，即督導各公司修復壞機，訂購新機，分途邁進，卅四年底全市發電量，即增至十四萬一千瓩。卅五年五月組織上海市供電審核委員會，依用途之緩急，定供電之先後，藉以調整各電氣公司用戶之負荷時間，使負荷因素得以平衡。至卅六年七月，增至十八萬二千瓩，而用戶需要日增，工廠需電尤急，仍感不數供應，乃又盡力督飭增加設備。上海電力公司運美修理之二一·五〇〇瓩發電機，旋即運回裝妥。又戰前新添未用之一五·〇〇〇　高壓發電機，經修理完整，正式發電。法商電車電燈公司損壞之七號電機修竣發電三·〇〇〇　，又新購之三·六〇〇瓩發電機一部，亦裝竣發電。閘北電氣公司除自行發電九五〇〇　外，並向吳淞永安紗廠　電一五〇〇瓩，浦東電氣公司向英國茂佛電機廠訂購二·五〇〇瓩汽輪發電機設備一套，已裝竣發電，近復向行政院善後救濟總署申請配得八〇〇　柴油發電設備一套，不久亦可運滬裝置。又華商電氣公司自租得上海水泥公司之發電機後，已發電七〇〇瓩，並向行總請購二·〇〇〇瓩新機兩座，亦已付款一半，俟交貨後，即可裝置。綜計以上增加之發電量，約達五萬瓩，茲將自接收至卅六年七月供電給全市電能及工業電能刊表如后：(註)全市售電度數內不包括同業　售電量</p>
<p>顧電量雖稍增加，電荒仍未能解除。公用局原擬有上海電力合理化計劃，而上海「參議會適於卅六年通過「籌組　　電氣公司」一案，公用局隨即數度召美各電力公司商討進行，原則一致通過，其詳細辦法及合約則在洽議中，成立之期，當不在遠。而中央方面，經市政府之　請，已允就日本賠償電機中，指撥五萬三千　發電機一套，由聯合電氣公司承受，是則不久之將來，本市電荒當有好轉之望也。</p>

<h3>八十年來之中國航運（上接第二十版）</h3>
<p>勝利後迄目前之航運狀况</p>
<p>英·美聯邦，感我政府及人民之英勇抗戰，艱苦卓絕，於抗戰之第七年一月十日，與吾國重行簽訌平等新約，百年桎桔，一旦解除，新約中有關航權者，如沿海貿易權·內河航行權·引水權等，完全收回，是誠可慶慰之事。</p>
<p>卅四年九月抗戰勝利，交通部設京滬·武漢·平津，廣東四特派員辦公處，各置航政接收專員，共接收日敵船舶二，七五一艘，二五一，二八八噸(其中千噸以上者二〇艘，五〇一噸至一千噸者二十三艘，其餘多爲小汽船，更有多數係駁船，大部份皆須修理方可用）。</p>
<p>復員運輸；水運佔主要地位，在船舶缺乏情况之下，主其事者，實已盡最大之努力，自卅四年九月十六日起，迄卅五年一月底，水道方面，由渝載出公務人員一一，七六〇人，眷屬五，一〇〇人，公商物品一九，二三七噸，部隊官兵三八，六〇〇人，軍品一三，五三五噸（上述數字指由渝東下者而言，其他由萬縣及巴東諸地運出者尚不在內)。卅五年二月交通部所擬國民政府還都水陸空聯遝計劃，第一期內由渝水運至京者達八萬人，物資四萬六千噸，幸均如期達到任務。</p>
<p>勝利後一方面忙於復員運輸，一方面因船隻奇缺，乃由我政府分別向美國，加拿大，英國，挪成，瑞典，丹麥各國進行租購船隻，並擴充海軍江南造船廠，使其至少先可承修商船，進而希望其能自行製造輪船，全國船舶艘數及噸位，照今年七月之統計；吾國已有船舶二，三八一艘，七二二，一〇〇噸（上列數字包括國營，民營，省營之各輪只）。</p>
<p>航機方面，除舊有之張江綫及南北洋綫憶由國營及民營各公司派有船只經常來往而外，最可經濟開發奮者，招商局在國軍公軍輸之餘，並積極籌備外洋含韻，數月以來，先後開關外洋航綫竟有八綫之多：</p>
<p>滬　綫——自上海至香港全程八二三浬。</p>
<p>中越綫——自上海至防全程一，〇三九浬。</p>
<p>中　綫——自上海經汕頭，香港，至曼谷，全程二，三五〇浬。</p>
<p>中關綫——自上海至關島全程一，六八七浬。</p>
<p>港厦　綫——自香港經厦門至馬尼刺全程七七八浬。</p>
<p>港星錢——自香港至星加坡全程一，四四八浬。</p>
<p>中印錢——自上海經香港，星加坡，仰光至加爾各答全程三，八五三浬。</p>
<p>中日綫——自上海至佐世保，神戶。</p>
<p>又有中聯輪船公司之　聯輪，曾一度由上海駛澳洲之雪梨，亦吾國戰後航業界十壯舉也。</p>
<p>如何發展航業</p>
<p>收回後，吾國內河沿海客貨運輸之需要，自當由國人自行供應，因此不僅戰前本國原有之船隻與噸位，應自行恢復，而戰前所有在我國內河沿海航行之外籍船舶與噸位，亦當由現在航商設法補足。南北洋及遠洋方面，日本原有之航業地位，至少有一部份亦當由吾人取而代之。此二項目標，若吾國政府具有決心提携並鼓勵全國航商，共同合作前進，似無大難，惟在此過渡期中，有三件事宜亟當同時舉一辦：</p>
<p>（甲）抵刷航業精神——航業爲重要社會事業，各方關係，萬分複雜，一切經營，必須以法治精神與科學方法，以謀業務之刷新。過去甚多陋規——如船上茶役或服務生强索小費或出賣舖位，碼頭工人亂索酒資等不良陳習，均須澈底革除。而當由各航商聯合設立低級船員訓練班，調訓或招訓一批新員工，再徐徐建立一新風氣出來。</p>
<p>（乙）促進航　建設——全國各種船舶之配置，棧埠之沒備，船廠之擴充，皆須及時趕辦。</p>
<p>（丙)訓練航海人才——航海人才缺乏，今觀各民營航運公司中尚有用西人爲船長者即可概見，如不及時培植，來日更將不敷應用，政府亟當加强商船，海事及水產學校，百年樹人，是爲根本辦法。</p>
<p>此三項事務；目前招商局之改革碼頭陋習，自辦槓力，積極修理全國各地倉庫碼頭，並開辦船員訓練班，雖則困難頗多，而該局進行不遺餘力，甚　各民營輪船公司，亦聯合力量，努力改進，達到相當時期，自可獲得圓滿之效果。</p>
<p>一世紀來，根據海關公佈數字，吾國之進出口數字，每每爲轍人遠勝過輸出，乃是我國貧弱之主因。究竟爲何如此？簡明言之；主持當局深深忽略運　事業與對外貿易之重要，此事可以今日之英國現狀舉例而述之：目前英國正感糧食與燃料缺乏，美國自動願予接濟，而英國當局要求全部接濟品須用英國綸船担任。</p>

<h3>八十年來之上海市公用事業　（上接第二十一版）</h3>
<p>四：煤氣</p>
<p>沿革</p>
<p>英商上海自來水公司，設於淸同治五年（一八六六）。光緖廿七年（一九○一）擴充股份，向香港政府註册。其營業區域，包括兩租界、爲本市唯一之煤氣事業公司。民國二十七年（一九三八）冬日人在吳淞張華浜北齊灣開設瓦斯工廠，另於市中心區五角塲設立大上海瓦斯公司爲營業所，期與英商自來火公司相抗衡。太平洋戰事發生以後，日人即慶取該公司與吳淞瓦斯廠合併經營，同隸於所謂大上海瓦斯公司。迨抗戰勝利，即由公用局接收該瓦斯廠改稱吳淞煤氣廠，作爲市營公用事業之一。至上海自來火公司則仍發還原主經營，今稱爲上海煤氣公司。</p>
<p>復員慨況</p>
<p>吳淞煤氣廠自經公用局接辦後，立即大加整理，並充實設備，煤氣產量遂自每月二八〇·○○○立方公尺（三十五年一月份）增至四四五·九九五立方公尺（卅五年十二月份），供應有餘，乃與上海煤氣公司洽訂合同，自卅五年十二月起·實行聯合供應虹口一帶煤氣，由吳淞廠售給煤氣公司每日十萬至七十萬立方英尺，以補該公司供應之不足。</p>
<p>煤氣爲最經濟淸潔之燃料，市民需要至爲股切。公用局爲推廣煤氣供應，以利市民起見，籌劃全市煤氣網，以期分佈平均。爰擬在南市設立煤氣廠，業於卅五年十月成立南市煤氣設計處負責計劃，已成初步方案，並在未設廠以前，決定先由吳淞煤氣廠在西藏路埋設幹管，以達南市，再以支當分佈各路，初步計劃，先接用戶五百家，不久當可實現。</p>
<p>五：陸上交通</p>
<p>沿革</p>
<p>（甲）電車部份：英商上海電車公司專營權係由　Bruce，Peebles　　　Co.讓與，淸光緒三十四年（一九○八）月有軌電車通車，行駛公共租界，民國三年（一九一四）十一月，無軌電車通車。法商電車電燈公司係承購比商國際遠東公司之設備，光緖卅四年正月有軌電車通車，民國十五年（一九二六）八月無軌電車通車，行駛法租界。民國元年（一九一二）滬紳陸伯鴻等集資組織華商電車公司民國二年八月十一日開始通車，行駛滬南區。民國七年（一九一八）併入華商電氣公司。（乙）公共汽車部份：華商公共汽車公司成立於民國十三年（一九二四），行駛閘北·江灣·市中心·引翔·眞如等區，嗣因中日戰爭，受軍事影響停業。英商中國公共汽車公司亦於同年設立，行駛公共租界。又滬南公共汽車公司停業後，公用局爲維持南市交通，於民國廿三年（一九三四）設立公共汽車管理處行駛滬南，曹涇等區。（丙）小型綫路部份：一爲上南交通公司一爲上川交通公司。前者發起於民國十年（一九二一）春，先組織上長途汽車公司，行駛皮輪福特汽車，旋應行旅之需要，舖築軌道，行駛小火車，民國廿二年（一九三三）改稱上南交通股份有限公司。後者於民國十年（一九二一）籌備，十一年（一九二二）二月　路開工，十三年（一九二四）四月成立公司，十四年（一九二五）十月慶寗寺至襲家路一段先行通車，十五年（一九二六）七月全綫工竣通車。此外連接鄰縣之長途汽車，計有滬太長途汽車公司於民國十一年一月通車，滬　長途汽車公司於同年十二月開辦。上松長途汽車公司創始於民國二是一年十月十日。錫滬長途汽車公司於民國廿四年八月十五日通車，均以本市爲基點，形成交通輻射狀態。</p>
<p>淪陷期內，日人將英商電車公司及英商中國公共汽車公司强行侵佔，合併改組爲上海都市交通公司。上川上南兩交通公司，則被僞市府侵佔後，設上川上南兩路管理處、以控制之，其他各長途汽車則以車輛或供我方軍用，或被敵人侵奪，均吿停業，勝利後，公用局分頭會同接收，各還原主，惟英商中國公共汽車公司因戰時車輛毀失無剩，宣吿結束。華商電氣公司之電車部份，悉被敵僞拆遝天津，尙在交涉收回，一時難期恢復，至堪痛惜</p>
<p>復員概況</p>
<p>全市有軌及無軌電車，行駛路綫，戰前華商及英法兩商共有廿八綫，戰時减爲十二綫。自本市復員，經公用局督促整修補充，英商方面，已恢復行駛有軌電車八綫，無軌電車六綫，法商方面，已恢復行駛有軌電車五綫，無軌電車三綫，公共汽車二綫，並爲便利行旅計，促使英法兩商在華山路舖換軌綫，實行聯運，惟因華山路面過狹，須使放寬後，方可實現耳。</p>
<p>勝利之初，市因公共交通，以受敵人摧毀過甚，車少人多，實難應付需要。公用局有鑒於此，竭力籌辦，公共汽車，於卅四年冬成立公共汽車公司籌備委員會及電車公司籌備處，積極推動，先行請準軍部發給舊車一百輛，拆卸改造爲公共汽車，勉供行駛，嗣向銀行商辦大宗借款，陸續添購新車，增關路綫，至卅五年十一月，爲集中統籌計，將兩籌備機構合併改爲公共交通公司籌備委員會，截至本年七月份止，是項公共汽車已有一七一輛，行駛十一綫，共長六六公里。</p>
<p>至市郊交通，則以獎觔民營爲主，規定郊區路綫，在正式　營公司尚未行車以前，暫準領有木市行基執照之汽車行或滬輪行行駛臨時畏途營業客車，現已核定行車者，已有七錢如下：</p>
<p>前上南兩小型鐵路，亦經公用局之營促整修設備，增加班次，浦東各地與本市之交通，亦漸次恢復載前狀態。</p>
<p>除上述外，市內其他車輛，愈集愈多，依卅六年七月底之統計，其數量如下：</p>
<p>祗以多數街道未經拓寬，車輛如此繁雜，將如何改善，乃成爲一甚難解決之課題矣。（下接二十三版）民元時的曆本，封面以黃帝紀年。</p>

<h3>八十年來之上海市公用事業　（上第二十二版）</h3>
<p>六：水上交通</p>
<p>沿革</p>
<p>浦江兩岸，人口稠密，往來股業，在未設輪渡之前，水上交通，端賴手搖民船，危險費時，不便殊甚。宣統二年（一九一○）九月，浦東塘工善後局爲便利辦公起見，租貸小輪，行駛浦東西，附載旅客，酌收渡資，經稟准縣道各機關立案，於十二月五日試航，是爲官辦輪渡之發軔。初由東溝直駛南京路外灘銅人碼頭，民國六年添駛西渡，八年添駛西　。創始時所用輪船，均爲租貸，民國二年始訂造公益一輪，十一年七月復購進公福小輪，更名公安，此外又置有公利公濟公道等大小拖船七艘，其他快船舢舨等三艘，行駛東　，慶寗寺，西渡各地，並自建碼頭，民國十六年（一九二七）秋，上海特別市政府成立，輪渡隨塘工局移交，初歸市政府浦東辦事處暫管，同年十二月該辦事處撤銷，改由公用財政兩局接辦，成立浦東輪渡管理處。十七年（一九二八）七月復由財政局將原管理營業部份一併移交公用局接管，逐將浦東輪渡管理處改稱浦江輪渡管理處，十九年復改爲輪渡總管理處，二十年八月上海市興業信託社接辦市輪渡業務，乃稱上海市輪渡管理處。</p>
<p>該處輪渡十四艘，戰事悉被征用，嗣由僞市政府改組爲上海特別市輪渡公司，僅存輪渡五艘，碼頭四處，公用局於卅四年九月接收後，設立輪渡公司籌備處繼續經營。</p>
<p>復員概況</p>
<p>公用局鑒於輪渡負有開發浦東地區，疏洩浦東西人口之使命，關係重要，不可不厚集資力，擴充設備，開闢航錢，爰先組設上海市輪渡公司籌備處籌組官商合辦之股份有限公司，竭年餘之努力，卒底於成。資本總額定爲國幣十五億元，將現有市輪渡之輪隻，碼頭，及一應器材予以估價，作爲公股，佔資本總額三分之一，其餘三分之二非公股，則洽由銀行承募市民認講，卅五年十一月二十日召開創立會，並與市政府訂立專營合約，至卅六年三月，公司正式成立。</p>
<p>顧以往輪渡，僅供旅客來往，而浦柬倉棧林立。物資渡江，槪須駁運，時間金錢損失極鉅，遂使物價益趨高漲。公用局爲彌補此項缺憾起見，決定在越江工程未能實施以前，先行建設卡車渡江輪渡，督促市輪渡積極興辦，並會同工務局地政局勘定建設碼頭地點，浦東爲南碼頭，浦西爲陸家浜支路，已於卅六年六月間興工建築，所需輪船，亦已購備，預定十月十日開始通航。</p>
<p>至民營濟渡方面，黃浦吳淞兩江，戰前原有三十餘處，戰時多數停航。本市復員後，公用局即督促逐一恢復，現經訂約承辦者，共卅二處。並爲保障行旅安全起見，黃浦江重要各渡，責令改用輪拖。吳淞江各渡，改用標準渡船。截至卅六年七月份止，黃浦江方面已改輪拖者計十二處，吳淞江方面已改標準渡船者計十四處。</p>
<p>七：碼頭倉庫</p>
<p>沿革</p>
<p>黃浦江自南市剪淞橋起至與吳淞止，長四十餘公里，沿浦兩岸，碼頭密佈。其間有本市自建者，有舊工部局及法公董局所建者，有國人興建者，亦有外商經營者。大小旣殊，構造亦異。南市方面，共有市有碼頭大小廿一座。蘇州河兩岸，自外白渡橋起至局家橋止，其問固定之小型碼頭凡一七四座，除少數爲商人所建者外，均屬市有。公用局爲整理碼頭倉庫，於民國二十年（一九三一）設立碼頭倉庫管理處，辦理疏　岸灘，修葺碼頭駁岸，與夫籌建碼頭各事宜，本市復員，租界收回，除就各碼頭主權性質，分別由航政局敵僞產業淸理處成交由原主接管外，其屬於市政府及舊工部局公董局所有者，槪由公用局接收管理，卅四年十月，恢復碼頭倉庫管理處，　　執行原有職黨。</p>
<p>復員概況</p>
<p>南市市有碼頭二十一座，戰時悉被敵人拖散，所存六座，均由改自他處移來，非復舊物。勝利以後，航運恢復，碼頭之需要極爲迫切，亟需統籌規復，除局部整修以供船隻並泊外，復於卅六年二月組織南市碼頭恢復委員會·將恢復工程，分兩期辦理，以修復一至九號碼頭爲第一期工程，修理其餘各碼頭爲第二期工程。第一期工程，託由工務局代辦，三十六年二月初開工，即將竣事。除七號碼頭爲木質木面浮式，及八號碼頭爲鋼質水泥面浮式外，餘均爲鋼質鋼面浮式，現並籌關該區爲本市碼頭示範區，俟第一期工竣後，再開始第二期工程。</p>
<p>南市碼頭，在淪陷時期，全未疏濬，淤積甚厚，非加疏挖，船隻不能並泊，即有碼頭，亦等虛設。公用局爰於整修碼頭之前，先行委託濬浦局予以疏濬，於卅五年十一月先就一至九號碼頭，進行挖泥工作，至三十六年四月完竣，隨即繼續疏挖十至十二號碼頭，及外瀟公司碼頭一至七號，十一號至十四號碼頭，以利停泊。</p>
<p>八：電話</p>
<p>沿革</p>
<p>上海電話，發　於大北電報公司，該公司於光緖七年（一八八一）成立，兼營特區電話，規模甚小，次年即由中日電話公司接辦。光緒廿四年（一八九八），華洋德律風公司承辦租界電話，與公共租界工部局簽訂特許合約，即於次年（一八九九）宣吿成立，至民國十九年（一九三○）八月該公司將全部財產告與美商上海電話公司，而租界改裝旋轉式自動電話機，亦即於民國廿一年全部吿成，至市區電話向由上海電話局辦理。該局成立於淸光緒二十八年（一九○二），初時規棋殊小，至民國九年（一九二○）始購地自建辦公室。十八年（一九二九）改裝步進式自動話機，業務漸趨擴展，並與租界電話用轉接方式互相溝通。</p>
<p>復員概況</p>
<p>上海市電話在敵人佔據時斯，機件綫路，非特毫無增添，抑且損壞甚劇，南市，閘北等區，拆毀尤多，現在人口激增，以多年有減無增之機錢，自感供不應求。上海電話公司所有機件，早已負數過量，經公用局之督促，乃向國外訂購新機一萬號，運到以後，方可擴充用戶。公用局復就話務之管理，及技術上督飭改進，二年餘來，情形已見改善。據公司報吿，五秒鐘內聽得撥號者，已由72.1％增至86.1％。同時訂定「裝置電話臨時限制辦法」以配合軍政機關之緊急需要，普通電話暫定裝置。公用局並與公司合辦電話工程司訓練班，以　備電話技術人材。</p>
<p>此外督促刋印新號簿，亦堪一述。緣本市電話號簿，早經停刋，復員以後，用戶住址，名稱變動極多，不獨用戶査詢爲難，而公司之問詢處，尤感日不暇給，公用局爰於卅五年春即開始與交通部上海電信局協商刋印統一號碼簿，新舊路名一併刋入，旣使用戶檢査便利，又可使新路名推廣宣傳，經公用局協助該公司調査編製，卅五年十月底脫稿，綜計用戶六萬五千餘戶，話機九萬號，由中國科學公司承印，中文本一千頁者出版十萬本，西文本五百五十頁者出版二萬本，所耗紙張達二百餘噸之鉅，卅六年二月印竣分發應用。</p>
<p>九：路燈，標準鐘路燈</p>
<p>上海市路燈，創設於滿光緒八年（一八八二），先是弧光路燈，由上海電氣公司經營，至光緖十六年始應用白熱電燈爲路燈。在民國廿六年間，全市共有二三，七九九　，戰時損失慘重，尤以閘北，滬南，浦東等舊市區爲甚，幾於全部破壞。復員以來，經公用局積極整修添裝，至卅六年七月份止，陸續恢復，全市共有一五，三○九　，較之初接收時八，○三五蓋，已增七，二七四盞，惟與恢復戰前原狀之月標，距離尙遠，交通燈爲管制交通之必要設備，公用局經在最擁擠之中區，添裝十八處，南市方面，則在老西門斜橋製造局路口，東門路裏馬路口，老北門　海路口等處，各添裝一組，以應需要。</p>
<p>標準鐘</p>
<p>公用局爲統一時刻，並使市民養成守時習慣起見，於民國二十年間，就滬南，閘北各區要道，裝置標準鐘，是年十月工竣啓用，共計母　二處，子鐮廿四處，戰時全遭破壞，勝利後，經公用局整修裝設者，已有二十四處，尙在籌劃推設中。</p>
<p>十·結語</p>
<p>公用專業，不特與人民日常生活有關，亦爲都市繁榮所　，任何地區，苟其水，電，煤氣，電話，以及車輛交通空無所有，人民生活，將感受何等不便；而如設備齊全，供應充足，則人民生活又將感受何等方便·具　公用事業有吸聚人口之巨大力量，而爲造成都市繁榮之重要條件。上海之　　所以冠全國者，其公用事業之發達，當不失爲一大因素，</p>
<p>抑又有進者，上海最重要之設施爲港務之建設，本人忝爲上海永久港務機籌起草方案之召集人，本方案業經港務整理委員會三　通過，不久常呈中央，希望早日實現。至於當前工作，應以擴充電力，節約浪費，增加工業生產爲第一義；改進滬西給水，完成滬西水廠爲第二義：擴展吳淞煤氣廠轉供南市居民爲第三義；增加公共車輛，以利民「行」爲第四義；及統籌其他各項公用事業之充分供應，爲第五義。本人接事以來，即召集專家共同硏究，分治標治本，着手推進，以求在配合民衆需要，發展都市計劃，並以「合理化」「企業化」「大衆化」爲目標，分別先後緩念，循序推行，凡此種種，實爲當前重大之課題，有待我全市民衆通力合作，盡最大努力，以赴事功者也。</p>
<h3>宣統遜位詔</h3>
<p>淸帝遜位，爲宣統作遜位諭旨者，爲狀元南通張季直。其全文曰</p>
<p>「欽朕奉隆裕太后懿旨，前因民軍起事，各省響應，九夏沸騰，生靈涂炭，特命袁世凱遣員，與民國代表討論大局，議開國會，公決政體。兩月以來，尙無確定辦法。南北睽隔，彼此相持，商輟於途，士露於野，徒以國體一日不決，故民生一日不安。今全國人民心理，多傾向共和，南中各省，旣倡讓於前，北方各將，亦主張於後，人心所向，天命可知。予亦何忍以一姓之尊榮，拂兆人之好惡，是用外觀大勢，內審與情，特率皇帝將統治權歸諸全國，定爲共和立憲國體，近慰海內厭亂望治之心，遠涉古聖天下爲公之義？袁世凱前經資政院選舉爲總理大臣，當茲新陳代謝之際，宜有南北統一之方，即由袁世凱組織臨時政府，與民軍協商統一辦法，總使入民安堵海內寗安，仍合漢滿蒙回藏五族，完全領土，爲一大中華民國。予與皇覺得以退處寬閑，優游歲月，長受國民之優禮，親見邦治之吿成，豈不懿哉？欽此！」</p>
<p>當時爲時勢所迫，雖說了「得以退處寬閑」，「豈不　哉」，但一經日本人引誘，便又皇　大發，做了傀儡，溥儀也實在是可笑可憐極了。國慶軼話</p>

<h3>Chairman's National Day Message to the People: Instructions on the Direction of Future Work; Clearing Obstacles to Build a Modern Nation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 9th] Chairman Chiang issued a National Day message to the people, a three-thousand-word document outlining the direction of compatriots' work in the coming year. In the political sphere, to establish a foundation of democracy and the rule of law, raise the standard of elections, and rectify the political atmosphere. In the economic sphere, to implement livelihood-based policies, earnestly plan and support private enterprises, and resolve land issues. In the cultural sphere, to strive for independence of academic thought as a basic guideline for future cultural construction. In the social sphere, to practice diligence and frugality, to embrace a life of hardship, and to demonstrate self-reliance and a strong will. Finally, exhorting compatriots to work together towards the above four goals domestically, and to uphold the spirit of independence and the principle of peaceful cooperation externally, to stand on our own in the world, to build China into a unified and progressive modern nation, to quell the rebellion, and to clear the obstacles to national construction.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Chairman Chiang issued the "Message to the People on the 36th National Day of the Republic of China" on the eve of the Double Tenth National Day. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Today is the 36th National Day of the Republic of China. The Constitution of the Republic of China was promulgated on New Year's Day this year. The election of representatives to the National Assembly and the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan will be completed within this year, and the Constitution will be fully implemented. As we commemorate the growth of the Republic of China during this period of transition from political tutelage to constitutionalism, we feel its significance even more deeply.</p>
<p>In the past year, the National Government convened the National Assembly, promulgated the Constitution, and gathered leaders from various parties and non-partisan individuals to participate in the government and jointly shoulder the responsibility of nation-building. In the coming year, we will welcome the birth of a constitutional government and complete the process of the National Construction Program. In these thirty-six years, patriotic people and the masses have gathered under the banner of the Three Principles of the People, striving to complete national construction and implement democracy. But in reality, first Yuan Shikai played with the provisional constitution and then discarded it; then feudal warlords, in the name of autonomy, carved out their own territories; and finally, communist bandits, under the guise of democracy, destroyed democracy. The constitutional history of the Republic of China is a record of the arduous struggle between the forces of nation-building and defending the law and the forces of betraying the nation and destroying the law. Today, democratic constitutionalism is approaching its final success, while the communist bandits' conspiracies and atrocities to subvert the foundation of the nation and destroy the law and discipline have reached the most ferocious and cruel stage. We cannot allow democratic constitutionalism to fail. We must maintain social order, ensure the people's happiness, and, even more, consolidate territorial sovereignty to entrust a complete country to the soon-to-be-established constitutional government, which will be considered as fulfilling the responsibility of revolutionary nation-building. Since the National Army recovered Yan'an, the communist bandits have completely exposed their original features as roving bandits. On the one hand, they have mobilized troops from the Hebei-Chahar-Rehe border region, dispersing and fleeing in various directions. On the other hand, they have formulated an underground work program, directing their hidden party members and foreign elements in various places to incite various disturbances in the rear of the National Army, opening up their so-called "second front." But their main goal is still to hold on to Jiaodong, in order to maintain the transportation line between the bandits inside and outside the customs. Therefore, the initial purpose of the roving bandits crossing the Yellow River southward was to disperse the strength of the National Army, in order to support their offensive in the Northeast and relieve the crisis in Jiaodong. When the National Army swept through Jiaodong and recovered Yantai, the communist bandits' established strategy completely failed, and the connection between the bandits inside and outside the customs was completely cut off. Thus, they launched their so-called "Sixth Offensive" outside the customs, attempting to thoroughly destroy our Northeast's territorial sovereignty. Inside the customs, they attempted to establish a precarious base in the Tongbai Mountains and the Dabie Mountains, and even hoped to threaten the safety of the central Yangtze River region and hinder the general election in neighboring areas. I must point out here that no matter how fierce the communist bandits' activities in the Northeast are, they will inevitably follow the precedent of the Fifth Offensive and suffer thorough punishment.

<h3>Pursuing National Self-Reliance with a Spirit of Respect for Law and Practicality; Premier Zhang's National Day Message</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Premier of the Executive Yuan Zhang Qun issued a National Day message on the eve of the Double Tenth Festival, entitled "Opening a Nation and Building a Nation." The full text is about two thousand words, first describing the domestic and international situation since the founding of the Republic of China. Secondly, it points out that today's internal affairs are a struggle between constructive forces and destructive forces, a struggle between democratic forces and anti-democratic forces; strengthening construction can offset destructive forces, and implementing constitutionalism is the way to eliminate anti-democratic forces. We should not place our hopes for construction after unification and stability. Regarding the construction problems of China today, Zhang strongly emphasized the importance of thrift, respect for law, and practicality. In conclusion, Zhang said: The world environment will no longer give China more time to hesitate. No matter what the situation is, we must pursue national self-reliance with a spirit of respect for law, practicality, hard work, and thrift.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The Central Broadcasting Station, in order to celebrate the 36th National Day, will hold a commemorative broadcast.

<h3>Zeng Qi Expresses National Affairs Thoughts</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] On the eve of National Day, Youth Party Chairman Zeng Qi expressed his thoughts on national affairs. He stated: To reverse chaos and restore order, to revive decline and invigorate, it is necessary to rectify the source and prescribe the right medicine. The world often sees rising prices and considers economic problems to be the most important, but I believe that politics causes military affairs, and military affairs affect economics, so political problems are still the most important. Although there are many solutions to political problems, the biggest key lies in constitutional governance. He also stated: To make constitutional governance successful, the three parties that jointly formulated the constitution must not hinder cooperation due to elections; we must absolutely maintain a democratic style and strictly prohibit bribery in elections, so as not to be laughed at by outsiders; we must establish a constitutional cabinet with broad inclusivity, embracing talent and not limited to the three parties; the whole country, from top to bottom, must strictly implement the constitution, regarding it as sacred and inviolable.</p>

First of all, we should thank the hard work of the Chinese and British flight personnel. We are admired by both houses of the British Parliament. China and Britain will jointly fight for the victory of justice. We are a friendship delegation and would like to extend our greetings to the Chinese people on behalf of the British people.

<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 9th] A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance said that Supervisor Simms of the Hong Kong government's import and export department's claim that smuggling between Hong Kong and mainland China is mainly due to the permission of Chinese officials is simply not true. The large number of customs smuggling cases alone proves this. As for the statement that the Chinese government has established "high-level officials", it refers to import controls. In terms of tariffs, the current tax rates have not increased, so-called high-level officials. As for merchants evading controls through smuggling, the only way to stop it is to strengthen anti-smuggling efforts.</p>

<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch, 9th] The turning point of the Northeast war situation is currently unfolding north, west, and east of Tieling. Bandit troops are desperately launching a full-scale attack on Tieling from the north, west, and east, attempting to strike the northern gateway to Shenyang.

Bandit troops on the northern front launched probing attacks in Tieling and Kaiyuan, hoping to cut off transportation between Tieling and Shenyang, but were defeated and suffered losses. They are currently regrouping and are expected to launch another large-scale offensive after Double Ten Day (October 10th). Several groups of bandit troops are also concentrating east of Siping, with the intention of attacking Siping. Bandit troops on the southern front launched a very urgent and dangerous attack on Yingkou. The Air Force first went to assist, followed by several main force battleships and cruisers from the Navy. With the joint attack by land, sea, and air, the bandit troops suffered heavy losses and fled eastward, and Yingkou was turned to safety. The ships captured twenty bandit junks fully loaded with military uniforms sailing from Penglai and Beidao, Shandong, to Dalian. Bandit troops on the western front spared no effort to destroy the railway near Xinmin. However, due to the strict guarding by the National Army and traffic police, they ultimately failed to achieve their goal.

<h3>Purchasing Cotton in the Salt Reclamation Area; Four-Banks Joint Council Approves Immediate Loans; Also Revises Loan Principles for Spinning Mills</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The 354th meeting of the Four-Banks Joint Council was held on the morning of the 9th, presided over by Zhang Qun. Zhang Qun gave a report on his observations of the Northeast and North China regions and instructed the Four-Banks Joint Council branches in those regions to step up their leadership of various banks and bureaus to assist in the development of important production industries with financial power.

Monthly interest rate of 5% for terms of up to 10 days; 2. Monthly interest rate of 6.5% for terms exceeding 10 days but up to 20 days; 3. Monthly interest rate of 8% for terms exceeding 20 days but up to 30 days.

<p>[Another Dispatch] Recently, spinning mills in various places have requested the Four-Banks Joint Council to relax the margin requirements for cotton import financing, and some regions have stated that it is impossible to handle the financing in accordance with the financing method, stating the difficulties and requesting permission to make factory down payments. The office especially put forward four revised principles of cotton mill lending to the Board of Directors for approval on the 9th: Each cotton mill's application for a loan shall be examined and approved on a case-by-case basis. The loan standard shall be determined on a case-by-case basis based on the actual number of spindles started by each cotton mill.

Flower numbers may only be used for financing, and there must be a factory order as proof before the financing is made; 2. Cotton mills' cotton purchase loans shall be based on financing in principle, and the term shall be determined according to the distance of the journey. If necessary, it may be converted to a down payment, with a maximum of 30 days; 3. Cotton mills in the inland areas are unable to arrange financing due to special circumstances, and may make down payments directly, with a term of 45 days; 4. The interest rate is 6% per month.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Reflections on National Day</h3>
<p>Today, we have once again reached the National Day of the 36th year of the Republic of China! On National Day, newspaper articles should have congratulatory remarks. During this period of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation, as we look back on the past, review the present, and look to the future, we truly feel both joy and fear, with countless thoughts that are difficult to express in a single sentence. "People feel refreshed when they encounter auspicious events." On this annual National Day, as we recall the glorious achievements and the fruits of the revolution, we should cheer up and be joyful. However, looking around, not only is the domestic situation vastly different from that of the previous two years, but also major changes have taken place in the global situation. The future disasters are just beginning, and we should not have the elegant mood to indulge ourselves because of National Day.</p>
<p>On the National Day two years ago, it was not long after the victory. The international community was full of peaceful sunshine and optimistic atmosphere, and the domestic situation was also refreshing, with people all over the country immersed in the celebration of victory. How long did it last? A year passed quickly. By National Day last year, it had changed from splendor to blandness. The whole world was gradually shrouded in gloom, and the sound of fighting was heard everywhere in the country. But on this day last year, hope, though faint, had not yet been extinguished. The international haze was not impossible to disperse, and the domestic peace talks were still likely to succeed. This year, although the streets are full of the blue sky, white sun, and red earth national flags, as in previous years, most people's hearts are covered with heavy shadows, and their steps are heavy!</p>
<p>Let's first look at the global situation. After the war, the international situation has been turbulent. Despite the fact that some politicians and diplomats have been running around all year round, devoting themselves to creating world peace and opening countless international conferences, the problems have not only failed to find solutions, but have become more and more complex and worse. Although the existence of this situation is disheartening, last year, people still thought that the ideal of "One World" that had been longed for during the war could eventually be realized. Today, objective facts make us dare not even say that we can maintain a shred of hope for this. Not to mention anything else, just the reappearance of the European Communist International can tell us that the world today has reached the eve of division. Take a look at the United Nations organization, which has also reached a critical juncture of survival. The existence of the veto power prevents the United Nations organization from functioning. If it is to be revised, whether it is to be restricted or cancelled, there is the possibility of the Soviet Union withdrawing from the United Nations. US Secretary of State Marshall's proposal, if passed by the UN General Assembly, will inevitably arouse strong opposition from the Soviet Union. Soviet representative Vyshinsky has already expressed his determination to fight for his position on this. Looking at the world today, the confrontation of great national walls has gradually become clear. The formation of this trend is not the kind of all countries of the world; the world peace after the war has not yet been created, and the allied countries that fought side by side during the war have parted ways. If the new world crisis is not rescued as soon as possible, then the catastrophe of mankind will soon happen before our eyes. I ask, what mood do we have to celebrate?</p>
<p>What China urgently needed after the war was peace and stability. Externally, we hoped for international peace, so that we could bury ourselves in the work of reconstruction and national construction in a peaceful atmosphere. China has learned a bloody lesson from the eight-year War of Resistance. After the pain, it should have seized the opportunity to bury itself in national construction and strengthen its national strength. The longer international peace lasts, the more we can hope that our national strength will be abundant. Internally, we must also strive for stability. After the eight-year War of Resistance, both the country and the people were exhausted. Everyone needed stability so that they could rest and recuperate in a stable environment and have the opportunity to recover, and then they could embark on the road to national construction.</p>
<p>However, world peace seems to be getting farther and farther away, and the domestic situation in our country is disturbed by the communists, and the whole country is in turmoil, with almost no peaceful days. The people in the communist-controlled areas are no less than living in deep water and hot fire. Even in other places, due to the destruction of transportation and production by the communists, prices have soared and life has become difficult, and there is a so-called "people do not have the means to live" scene. Recently, the communists have been scurrying around in various provinces, making people displaced and unable to live and work in peace. Although the government has concentrated all its efforts on suppressing the rebellion, the effectiveness of suppressing the rebellion depends on the full cooperation of the people across the country. In order to cope with the future international upheaval and to relieve the suffering of the people, we should redouble our efforts to suppress the rebellion in the sound of National Day, so that the communists can be eliminated as soon as possible, the country can be stable, and then we can actively build the country and enhance our power to speak in the international arena, which will be beneficial to future world peace.</p>
<p>Welcome to the British Parliamentary Delegation to China</p>
<p>The British parliamentary delegation to China, led by Lord Ammon, a veteran of the British Labour Party, came to China for a personal visit. Due to bad weather, it was repeatedly postponed. It finally flew from Hong Kong to Shanghai at about 5:00 PM yesterday and immediately took the original plane to the capital to meet with the authorities in our country. We express our warm welcome to the members of the British parliamentary delegation to China and believe that this trip will have a significant impact on Sino-British relations.</p>
<p>First, although Sino-British relations have not been considered friendly in the past, since the Second World War, they have shared weal and woe, and the depth of their alliance is not superficial. Although there are still some problems to be solved through consultation, we believe that under the wise government of the British Labour Party, it will not be difficult to find a reasonable solution and open a new page in Sino-British relations. Today, Britain and North Korea are concerned about China, as Lord Ammon said: "Today, the extent to which our parliament and people care about China is the same as during the war." Our understanding of Britain's situation is also greater than ever.</p>
<p>Second, China and Britain are in almost the same position in today's world. During the war, China fought alone in Asia, independently supporting the war against Japan; after France's defeat and surrender, Britain also stood still and fought to the death with the Nazis. After the war, China and Britain suffered the greatest losses and made the most sacrifices, and they encountered many difficulties. They have not yet returned to their peacetime state. Therefore, China and Britain are not only wartime allies, but also friends in need after the war. They should help each other to overcome the current difficulties.</p>
<p>Third, the domestic and foreign policies of the British Labour Party cabinet are most worthy of our praise. The spirit of the rule of law and the clarity of domestic affairs are admired by the world. Its enlightened foreign policy has won praise from all countries in the world. Recently, the British cabinet has undergone a partial reorganization, appointing a large number of young and promising politicians, making the Attlee cabinet the most energetic government in the world, which is especially worthy of our emulation in order to reform our political style.</p>
<p>Fourth, although Britain's position in the international community has undergone major changes after the war, it is still one of the major countries related to the Far East. We want to tell the members of the British parliamentary delegation to China that the core of the Far East problem after the war lies in how to prevent the resurgence of Japanese aggression. Both China and Britain are willing to coexist peacefully with Japan, but they must not allow the reactionary forces of Japan to revive. Whether it is for China's security or for Britain's interests, being too indulgent with Japan and allowing its warlords and financial groups to resurrect will inevitably sow the seeds of future disasters. Therefore, China and Britain should stand on the same front in the future peace conference with Japan and oppose any measures that are too lenient with Japan.</p>
<p>The British parliamentarians are all visiting China for the first time and have no preconceived notions, making it easier to recognize the reality of China. We hope that after you return to your country, you will tell the people of the country the impression you have gained of how the Chinese people are struggling under the leadership of the government to overcome difficulties and the feelings of concern that the Chinese people have for Britain.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen's Radio Address</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 1) Song Ziwen's radio address briefly stated: "Since I arrived here, I have seen from all sides that my compatriots' lives are so difficult that I cannot sleep or eat in peace, and I am eager to think of a way to save them. Recalling that I was ordered by the Father of the Nation in the 12th year of the Republic of China to open the Central Bank, I was only approved to open the business with a fee of 3,000 yuan. Since I was ordered, I had to work hard to do it. The Father of the Nation also instructed me that doing things must be down-to-earth. The issuance of banknotes is not only convertible, but must also be convertible on the spot, and there must be sufficient hard currency income before the appropriate amount of banknotes can be issued, so that there will be no inflation. During the Northern Expedition, we would rather endure temporary pain than suffer long-term pain due to inflation. The Father of the Nation said at the British Bank opening ceremony that we can only eat eggs, not chickens. This is really the best way to manage everything. Relying on the instructions, I overcame all difficulties. By the time of the Northern Expedition, the Central Bank's banknotes even exceeded the face value of silver coins by one yuan per ticket. Later, I was ordered to be the Minister of Finance of the National Government and the Director of Finance of Guangdong. In the past, the highest annual income of Guangdong Province was only more than 20 million yuan. After I took over, it gradually increased to 100 million yuan. In the 15th year of the Republic of China, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek swore to start the Northern Expedition, and in the 16th year, he established his capital in Nanjing. The supplies of the Northern Expedition Army were fully supplied, which was all due to the fact that at that time, corruption was eliminated and every drop was returned to the public. Twenty years later, when I returned, the economy and finances of my Guangdong Province were difficult and exhausted, and it has come to this point. However, Guangdong is rich in produce, has a large population, and has many talents. As long as public officials throughout the province follow the Father of the Nation's instructions to be down-to-earth as the spirit of doing things, really think about it, really do it, eliminate corruption, and return every drop to the public, I believe Guangdong will become more and more stable and more and more happy."</p>
<h3>Serious Crisis Facing the Shipping Industry; Tonnage Increase Figures</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 1) Li said, first of all, about the increased tonnage of national ships, that before the war, China's merchant ships had 500,000 tons. Forty percent were lost during the war. In the early days of the restoration, the remaining ships were less than 100,000 tons. By Double Ten Day last year, it increased to 491,979 tons. In the past year, it has increased by another 350,000 tons, and the total tonnage in the country is now 843,315 tons, of which China Merchants Bureau accounts for 300,000 tons, Minsheng Company more than 54,000 tons, China Tanker Company more than 52,000 tons, Yixiang Steamship Company more than 18,000 tons, and Dawei Datong more than 12,000 tons. Ships using coal and those using oil each account for half. Now the traffic on the Yangtze River, northern Jiangsu, Shanghai-Ningbo-Wenzhou, Shanghai-Taiwan, Shanghai-Qingdao, Shanghai-Tianjin, and Shanghai-Yushu lines is more convenient than before. There are also more than ten ships sailing to India, the South Seas Islands, and the Americas. The ships ordered by various companies from foreign countries will arrive in China one after another, with a total of about 200,000 tons. The goal of the initial construction of one million tons can be expected to be achieved soon.</p>
<p>Li then stated the importance of maintaining shipping rights, pointing out that in the past year, foreign merchants have repeatedly attempted to covet China's shipping lanes with various covers. Fortunately, the government and the people's crew members have continued to protect the newly recovered inland and offshore navigation rights, so that the integrity of the territorial waters can be maintained.</p>
<p>Soaring Costs</p>
<p>Li then reported that the soaring of navigation costs is the biggest pain of the shipping industry in the past year. For example, the increase in the cost of living for workers and the official price of coal has increased from 110,000 yuan per ton to 920,000 yuan. The official price of fuel oil has increased from 144,000 yuan per ton to 2,820,000 yuan. The shipping association has always been very careful about adjusting freight rates, so that the slowly increasing income cannot keep up with the rapidly increasing costs. Yesterday (8th), the price of oil distributed by Mobil, Asia, and other oil companies per ton was: refined diesel oil 4,060,000 yuan, medium diesel oil 3,810,000 yuan, heavy diesel oil 3,690,000 yuan, and fuel oil 2,820,000 yuan (including customs duties and surcharges), which is more than four times the previous distribution price. For example, the Jingxing Steamship needs 180 tons of oil for a round trip to Qingdao, which costs 507,600,000 yuan, and the income is only enough to buy oil. The remaining expenses such as wages, repairs, and supplies are not covered. Many oil-fueled ships have been forced to suspend operations. If this serious problem is not resolved urgently, most of the ships of various companies will also be forced to suspend operations.</p>

<h3>After the Establishment of the New Communist International, China's Red Bandits Will Become More Rampant; Wu Tiecheng Urges People to Suppress the Rebellion and Build the Nation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing, 9th] A reporter from the Nanjing Central Daily News asked Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng yesterday about the future development and influence of the New Communist International on the Far East, especially China, after its establishment in Beijing. Wu said: The establishment of the New Communist International has made the turbulent international situation even more serious. The national freedom movement of various weak nations in the Far East and Southwest Asia will suffer adverse effects, and China's Red Bandits will take the opportunity to become more rampant, which goes without saying. Wu continued: Under this situation, the people of the whole country, especially the Kuomintang members, should be more vigilant for the sake of national security and national independence. They should be more vigilant in their respective positions and work harder for a goal with their abilities and financial resources. What is this goal? It is to suppress the rebellion and build the nation. Because the suffering of the people after the war is the price of sacrifice that should be paid for the victory of the eight-year War of Resistance. After the victory, this kind of suffering cannot be reduced, or even aggravated, which is all caused by the communists. We cannot allow the suffering of the people to continue for a long time, so the first thing we must do is to eliminate the communists.</p>
<p>Regarding the international significance of the Communist International Declaration, Wu said: After the Second World War, democracy rose, and under this mainstream, all relations between countries are mutual aid, not aggression. The New Communist International condemns the aid to Europe, South America, and the Far East by the United Kingdom and the United States as imperialist behavior, which is purely a political excuse. The Chinese have heard this kind of propaganda rhetoric from the communists countless times in the past 20 years. In short, justice cannot be separated from facts. Any false propaganda can only deceive people for a while, not forever.</p>
<h3>The Restoration of the Communist International Is a Diplomatic Gesture; Li Junlong Talks Before Leaving Hankou for Kaifeng</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 9th] Li Junlong, Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, took a special train from Hankou to Kaifeng this morning. Before leaving, he said that the main purpose of the Soviet Union's restoration of the Communist International was to use it as a bargaining chip in the UN General Assembly. The United States and the Soviet Union do not want to go to war at present. It is a big mistake to think that this is the prelude to the Third World War.</p>

Except for silver shops, buying and selling are strictly prohibited. Citizens are being mobilized to form economic inspection teams to strictly monitor the selling prices of silver shops. The Price Stabilization Committee will decide on purchases at any time. If the gold quantity of merchants and civilians is insufficient, the committee will supply it, aiming to maintain the workers' livelihoods.</p>

<h3>Announcement</h3>
<p>On the joyous occasion of Double Ten, the whole country celebrates. Our newspaper is specially publishing an additional three and a half pages on this auspicious occasion, with many articles focusing on the heroic and tragic historical events of the revolution, or words of praise and encouragement. Not only are they rich in historical value, but they can also inspire the will to quell the rebellion and mobilize. Due to limited space, the articles from all parties could not be published. We extend our gratitude and apologies. Furthermore, the printing and typesetting were rushed, resulting in an error in the article "China's Shipping in the Past Eighty Years." In the last line of the twenty-first page, "must be undertaken by British ships" should connect to the fifteenth line of the seventeenth page, "transportation, otherwise willing to not accept relief." We hereby correct the error, hoping that the author and readers will understand!</p>
<h3>Chairman's Message to the National People</h3>
<p>As for the internal bandit army, it is already in an isolated situation. The National Army will be able to strictly pursue and encircle and annihilate the bandit remnants south of the Yellow River, and will never allow their conspiracies to succeed. However, we must be vigilant that, in this short period after the failure of the Communist bandits in Jiaodong, as long as the National Army and governments at all levels have any negligence, they will surely take the opportunity to stir up trouble, with riots at any time in the countryside and disturbances everywhere in the cities. The purpose of this kind of perverse behavior is to destroy the stability of society. Only by working together with the government, holding steadfastly with determination, and upholding unwavering faith can we smash their conspiracies and make concerted efforts in all aspects of politics, economy, culture, and society to eliminate these bandits who destroy the country, undermine the constitution, and disturb the people's livelihood, and complete the mission of quelling the rebellion and building the nation.</p>
<p>Future Work Directions for the Coming Year</p>
<p>I, Zhongzheng, sincerely point out the direction of work for the coming year, and I deeply hope that all compatriots across the country will work together to make it a reality.</p>
<p>Political Direction (1) In the political aspect, it is imperative to establish the foundation of democracy and the rule of law, improve the level of elections, and rectify political conduct. This needs to be explained in two points: A. After the Constitution was promulgated on New Year's Day this year, election laws and regulations were promulgated as scheduled, and the registration of electors and candidates in various provinces and cities has been completed in sequence. The election campaigns of candidates in various provinces and cities are also in full swing. It must be understood that the success or failure of this election will determine the success or failure of constitutional government. Electors must carefully cast their sacred vote, and candidates should respect and love themselves even more, correct all the abuses of the elections in the early Republic of China, and put forward political views for the free choice of the vast electorate. We must make the elections have a rigorous atmosphere before we can expect the elections to have noble achievements. We can say that this year's election is the pivot of the reconstruction of the Republic of China and the indicator of the revival of the Chinese nation. Only when all the people of the country can choose the representatives they can trust to exercise political power can we hope that all the people of the country can support the democratic constitution to last forever. B. The foundation of democracy lies in the rule of law. As the decree to prepare for constitutional government is about to be completed, the government and the people must work together to seek the implementation of the spirit of the rule of law. The people should develop the habit of abiding by the law, and officials should base everything on the law, striving to make the political atmosphere move towards rectification, and the people's rights are guaranteed, and advance together on the right track of the rule of law. Only then can the democratic system have a solid foundation.</p>
<p>Economic Aspect (1) In the economic aspect, it is necessary to implement facilities for the people's livelihood. In particular, we must carefully plan for the support of private enterprises and the solution of land problems. After the end of the war, economic construction is the unanimous requirement of the country. The central goal of economic construction is to solve the land problem in the process of industrialization, so that social production can be increased, the people's lives can be improved, and the increase in the purchasing power of the rural areas will cultivate a vast market for industrial products, which is the basic condition for urban prosperity. We know that the industrial policy of the Principle of People's Livelihood is to restrict monopoly capital from manipulating the people's livelihood with a state-owned system, so as to protect the free development of general private enterprises. The government's tax system and the bank's investment policy should be in line with this policy. Only then can social production be expected to progress and export trade can be expected to increase. It must be understood that enriching the people is the way to seek the increase of national strength. I, Zhongzheng, put forward this principle to all compatriots across the country on the Double Ten Festival the year before last, as a guide for post-war national construction. Today, I reiterate this idea, and I deeply hope that the economic circles across the country can cooperate with the government to ensure its effective implementation and lay the foundation for the Chinese nation to be self-reliant.</p>
<p>Cultural Aspect (2) In the cultural aspect, we must strive for the independence of academic thought. Long before the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, I, Zhongzheng, pointed out to the cultural circles that "the Second World War can be said to be a cultural war. The success or failure of nationalism, democracy, and socialism in Europe and the United States in the past 350 years all lie in this war, and the rise and fall of China's 5,000-year-old culture and its moral spirit are also the touchstone for this war." More than two years have passed since the end of World War II, and the international cultural struggle and political situation have become increasingly intensified. Chinese culture has also suffered from the political struggle of the Communist bandits. The national spirit of firmness and bravery during the War of Resistance Against Japan has been lost and gradually declined, especially the intellectual youth have not been able to develop independent and autonomous thinking ability. A part of them even follow others, are played by others, and abandon their original intention of studying, willing to be used as tools for political struggle. People who love the country and worry about the times are all deeply saddened by this. It must be understood that since the history of our Chinese nation, although it has been repeatedly subjected to foreign invasions, it has still been able to stand still and survive majestically, relying on the national confidence to resist the invasion of foreign races, and has always been maintained without falling. When the country is in danger, it can still be revived, but if the culture perishes, there will be no hope of recovery. Therefore, the independence of academic thought is the basic guideline for cultural construction in the future. I hope that the national cultural circles will catch up quickly and go to this noble goal together.</p>
<p>Social Aspect (3) In the social aspect, we must practice a diligent and thrifty life, and we must develop the ambition of self-reliance and self-improvement. It must be understood that extravagance is the root of national subjugation, and waste is the enemy of national construction. After the World War, all countries in the world are doing their best to encourage production and conserve consumption in order to engage in post-war revival. Look at the United Kingdom, which is strictly practicing austerity and restricting consumption, how thorough it is. Even the United States, which has a strong economic power, has recently called on its people to reduce food consumption. Other emerging countries are working hard to encourage each other and striving to be self-reliant. Moreover, our China has experienced such a long period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and has been added to the destruction of the Communist bandits. The entire society is devastated and the nation's humiliation is deep. If we are still ignorant and follow the old ways, and do not know how to be vigorous, or waste without limit, or be lazy and complacent, then not only will the post-war revival be hopeless, but the entire nation will inevitably be eliminated and will not be able to survive. In the past two years, I have repeatedly alerted my compatriots that "the post-war hardship must be many times greater than that of the War of Resistance Against Japan." Today, I would like to solemnly exhort my compatriots across the country to be sure to thoroughly repent and be self-reliant with shame, eliminate the bad habits of extravagance, waste, being opportunistic, and being fluke. On the one hand, we must tighten our belts and work hard, and on the other hand, we must rely on our own efforts to overcome difficulties. This is the only way for our country to build the nation. Every compatriot must fulfill his responsibility to the country and seek survival for himself. He must have the ambition to improve and make painstaking efforts. I also hope that social leaders will practice what they preach and promote it as much as possible in order to create a national construction style and promote the success of national construction.</p>
<p>Compatriots, at this important juncture of quelling the rebellion and building the nation, we must recognize that the safety of the country and the nation depends entirely on our efforts today. On the domestic front, we must establish the foundation of democracy and the rule of law, implement facilities for the people's livelihood, strive for the independence of academic thought, practice a diligent and thrifty life, and develop the ambition of self-reliance and self-improvement. On the foreign front, we must uphold the spirit of independence and self-reliance, and the purpose of peaceful cooperation, in order to stand on our own in the ever-changing world of international affairs, so as to build China into an independent, unified, and progressive modern country, quell the rebellion of the Communist bandits, and eliminate the obstacles to national construction, so as to comfort the spirits of the founding father of the Republic of China and the revolutionary martyrs.

<h3>Lovett Condemns New Communist International for Intentionally Sabotaging European Recovery Affiliating Countries Should Bear All Responsibility</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 8th] Acting US Secretary of State Lovett announced today: if the Communist Party Information Bureau, recently announced at the Warsaw Conference, succeeds in its plan, it will inevitably cause the European economy to collapse. Lovett's full statement is as follows: "The US State Department has closely examined the materials on the meeting of representatives of Communist Parties from nine European countries published in the Soviet newspapers, as well as the resolution of the establishment of the Information Bureau (including representatives of the central committees of the Communist Parties of each country) in Ziegeler. At the same time, the State Department has also found that responsible cabinet members (including the Soviet Union) from several countries are included among these representatives. The words of the Warsaw Conference Declaration are deliberately defamatory of the goals of the British and American people in the Great War and distort US policy. Its wording coincides with the arguments of Communist newspapers in various regions. The documents issued by the Warsaw Conference make it clear that the governments and parties involved in this plan have expressed their determination to do their utmost to prevent the economic recovery of Europe. The European people, all those who voluntarily believe in this malicious announcement, should bear their own responsibility. Because if the ideas of the Warsaw Conference exist, then the collapse of the European economy will be inevitable. We must remain calm and clear in our judgment and not leave our posts, and continue to examine with sympathy and calm reality how Europe can regain its place in a peaceful and stable world."</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 8th] Lovett declared: There has been significant progress in the technical discussions between countries on the Marshall Plan, and statements on some aspects of it will be issued within ten days. At present, technical committees from various countries are holding meetings in Washington, and members of the Executive Committee of the Paris Conference (including British representative Frank and French representative Erfen) are about to come here to participate. Regarding the issue of US interim aid to Europe, Lovett stated: The government is determined to do its best to take out the last dollar in the existing fund to aid Europe. When reporters asked whether the US had obtained "sufficient funds" for France, Lovett replied that the funds obtained were "not sufficient." He hoped that the meeting in Brussels would distribute the gold bars obtained by Germany as soon as possible, and if that were the case, France might obtain sufficient funds.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 8th] Diplomatic personnel here are deeply impressed by Lovett's powerful statement. It is expected that this statement was drafted after detailed discussions with Secretary of State Marshall and close study of all the circumstances related to this Communist action. Lovett also revealed that Ambassador Smith, who returned to the US from Moscow on the 7th, will report to the State Department today and will go to New York to review the general US-Soviet relations with Marshall.</p>
<h3>The US President's Emergency Aid to Europe Plan Is Gradually Gaining Support in Congress Eaton Strongly Advocates for Speeding Aid to France and Italy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 8th] Chairman Eaton of the House Foreign Affairs Committee publicly demanded on the 8th "emergency relief" for France and Italy, and expressed that he hoped Congress would convene a special session before December to take action. Eaton said: He has received intelligence that he believes the situation in Western Europe is so serious that the US has no choice but to "directly" provide assistance. He is determined to have the Foreign Affairs Committee consider President Truman's plan to make 580 million available to cover European shortages, pending congressional action on the long-term Marshall Plan. Committee members who previously opposed assistance have all "changed their positions" due to recent developments and the deteriorating situation.</p>
<h3>Britain and the Soviet Union Agree to Resume Negotiations Britain Demands that the Soviet Union First Repay Its Debts</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 8th] Sources from senior British government officials said that Britain and the Soviet Union have expressed here their willingness to reopen British-Soviet trade negotiations, but the stalemate on the loan issues of 1941 and 1944 has not been broken. The sources said that after the Soviet ambassador to Britain, Rubis, returned to Britain from Moscow last week, he visited Wilson, the former Minister of Overseas Trade. Moscow hopes to reopen trade negotiations as soon as possible, but requests that the previous debts be negotiated first, and asks for concessions on the repayment terms. It is reported that Wilson reiterated that Britain is also willing to conduct discussions on amending the loan conditions, and that the Soviet Union must first pay the remaining half of the 2.43 million pounds due on August 1.</p>
<h3>The French Prime Minister Announces New Economic Measures</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 9th] French Prime Minister Ramadier broadcast to the French people at 6:30 pm (Greenwich time) today, announcing a plan to drastically cut government expenses, tighten tax collection, ban luxury goods, and balance the 1948 budget, and to prevent inflation with new hard work.</p>
<h3>Bidault Criticizes New Communist International</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 9th] French Foreign Minister Bidault, who came here to attend the UN General Assembly, will return to Paris tomorrow. He told reporters today that the new Communist International in Europe is nothing but "another big mistake after many big mistakes." The establishment of an information bureau by the Communist Party in the Yugoslav capital is a further obstacle to international cooperation and the pursuit of peace.</p>
<h3>Trade between Eastern and Western Europe Needs to Be Restored Clayton Expresses Optimism</h3>
<p>[Our report] New York, 9th Broadcasting: Washington News, US Undersecretary of State Clayton told a press conference today: Although trade relations between Eastern Europe and Western Europe are currently frustrated due to political differences, he believes that they will eventually be restored sooner or later. Although Eastern Europe currently has very little surplus food and raw materials, it may increase in the future. For the benefit of Eastern Europe itself, it is also necessary to restore trade with Western Europe. The report of the sixteen-nation European conference is also based on the assumption that trade between Eastern and Western Europe will be restored. This press conference was the first since Clayton returned to the US from Europe.</p>
<h3>Taerp Explains the Meaning of US Aid to Europe</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Chongqing, 8th] US Assistant Secretary of State Taerp told the UN General Assembly's Economic Committee today: The US has resumed some wartime controls to help solve global poverty problems. He also said that international cooperation is necessary. Taerp said that the US has not used its economic power to seek power outside the country. Taerp denied that the Marshall Plan had conditions that violated the UN Charter, pointing out that the only requirement of the Marshall Plan was that Europe needed to take the initiative and that the recovery plan should be an international design.</p>
<h3>British Attitude Turns Tough on Trade Preference System Issue</h3>
<h3>British Gold Reserves Almost Depleted British Economy Faces Desperate Situation Cripps Appeals to the United States for Assistance</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] Economic Minister Cripps told a press conference today that if Europe and the UK do not obtain new sources of dollars in the near future, they will have to further reduce imports from the dollar area, which is the beginning of a strategy that must be adopted. If this is not stopped quickly, the British economy will gradually be suffocated.</p>
<p>We have no other way to escape. We have begun to use gold and dollar reserves. The amount of this reserve is not large and is for the entire sterling area. Other countries may also face the same problem, and there will be no way to deal with their people. If the remaining 400 million yuan of the US loan to Britain can be unfrozen, it is quite possible that Britain can get through this year, but the future development still depends on the extent to which we use our reserves. I do not believe that British exports to the US can be balanced with US exports to Britain. Britain should reduce imports and increase production to expand exports to make up for its trade deficit. However, the problem of trade deficit with the dollar area is still unsolvable. This is a difficult problem to control the entire world economy. We cannot get out of difficulties until it is solved.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 9th] Authoritative sources said that Britain will sell another 80 million US dollars worth of gold reserves to the US this week to make up for its shrinking dollars. This is the second time in three weeks that it has sold gold reserves to the US. The last time was on September 15, when 80 million were sold. Although the government's remaining gold reserves are kept strictly secret, it is estimated that there are only 2.244 billion yuan left.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Will Build a Submarine Base in Vladivostok</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] The Navy Department today did not comment on the rumors that the Soviet Union had plundered the former German major submarine shipyards in the Baltic Sea and taken away its machinery and technicians. However, according to unofficial sources, the Soviet Union is dismantling the facilities and rebuilding its submarine military equipment with the area near Vladivostok as the center.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Authorities Forbid the Czech-Polish-French Alliance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 8th, United Press] The "News Evening Post" here said today that the Moscow authorities have forbidden Czechoslovakia, Poland, and France from concluding a military alliance. Negotiations on the conclusion of the alliance have suddenly ended due to the establishment of the New Communist International in Gierle.</p>
<h3>Two Yugoslav Diplomats Expelled from Chile Brazil May Break Off Relations with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Our Report] New York, 9th Broadcasting: Santiago, Chile News, Two Yugoslav diplomats were recently accused by the Chilean government of being suspected of engaging in Communist activities and were expelled from the country last night. One of the two is K, the Yugoslav Chargé d'Affaires in Chile, and the other is K, the secretary of the Yugoslav Embassy in Argentina, who recently came to Santiago as a tourist. It is said that they had received an order from the Communist International in N Capital, urging them to step up their opposition to the US in various countries in the Americas.</p>

<h3>UN Political Committee Passes US Proposal Establishes Balkan Inspection Group Vyshinsky Severely Reprimands US</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 8th] The United Nations General Assembly's Fifty-Seventh Committee tonight passed the case to establish a Balkan Surveillance Group with 30 votes in favor and six votes against. The Soviet bloc countries voted against it. The meeting also passed a clause in the U.S. proposal by a vote of 39 to 6, requiring Yugoslavia, Albania, Bulgaria, and Greece to cooperate with the Special Monitoring Group, but another clause requiring the General Assembly to decide on the implementation of assistance to the three countries of South Albania and Bulgaria in handling border affairs has not yet been put to a vote.</p>
<p>France proposed an amendment advocating for the remaining clauses. US Representative Johnson expressed agreement, but only on the condition that the three countries recognize the UN Balkan Monitoring Group. Soviet Representative Vyshinsky immediately rose and spoke with a severe tone, accusing the United States of intimidating the three countries of South Albania and Bulgaria with a "final solution". He claimed that this is a demand, a final ultimatum, not a solution, and representatives should not be subject to this "despicable act". Vyshinsky also turned to Johnson and scolded: "If you can get a majority, you can do this, but why attach conditions?" At the same time, the Cuban representative formally proposed that the United Nations conduct a thorough investigation into the seven countries of Eastern Europe, expanding the original scope of investigation from the four countries of Greece, South, Albania, and Bulgaria to include Hungary, Romania, and Poland, all of which, except for Greece, belong to the Soviet sphere of influence.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 8th] Our delegation to the General Assembly today submitted an amended proposal to the committee on the voting procedures of the Security Council in order to promote the effective work of the Security Council. The original proposal is as follows: In order to promote the effective work of the Security Council and to complete the important work prescribed by it, and in order to improve the implementation of the Security Council's work during the period of complete coordination of spirit and text, the Chinese delegation recommends that the General Assembly take the following measures: (A) It is recommended that the Security Council regard the following points as procedural matters, and deal with them in accordance with Article 27, Paragraph 2 (that is, the Security Council's resolution on procedural matters shall be voted on by seven member states). The issue of whether a question submitted to the Security Council is a situation or a dispute; Whether a member of the Security Council is in a position as a party to a dispute related to a certain issue discussed by the Security Council, and therefore needs to comply with the provisions of the Charter and not participate in the relevant voting; The issue of the conditions under which a non-member state of the United Nations may become a party to the Statute of the International Court of Justice in accordance with Article 93 of the Charter; The issue of requesting the International Court of Justice to express its opinion on any legal issue submitted to the Security Council, or any legal aspect of a situation or dispute.

(Note: Paragraph 3 is the so-called veto power provision, the original text is as follows: The decision of the Security Council on all other matters shall be made by an affirmative vote of seven members, including the decisions on matters contained in Article 52, Paragraph 3 of Chapter VI, concerning the peaceful settlement of disputes. The states party to a dispute shall abstain from voting. The above-mentioned Chapter VI is about the peaceful settlement of disputes. The original text of Article 52, Paragraph 3 of the Charter is as follows: The Security Council shall encourage the development of the peaceful settlement of local disputes through regional arrangements or by regional agencies, either on the initiative of the states concerned or by reference from the Security Council.) (C) It</p>
<p>It is declared in the "separate" case that when the Security Council is discussing any issue submitted to it and cannot adopt a proposal voted on by a majority of seven or more members of the Council (including the four permanent members), the countries constituting the above-mentioned members may request the Secretary-General of the General Assembly to convene a meeting of the General Assembly to consider this issue. This request made by the Security Council in accordance with Article 3 of the Provisional Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly has the same force. (Article 3 roughly means: A special session of the General Assembly may be held within fifty days after the Secretary-General or the Security Council or a majority of the members of the United Nations request a special session. This issue shall be included in the agenda, and the Secretary-General shall convene a special session of the General Assembly.</p>

<h3>Confirmed Evidence of Audit Extortion Ten Tax Officials Prosecuted The District Prosecutor's Office Details the Process Liu Runxian and Three Others at Large</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Tax Bureau officials Gao Shijie, Xie Lianxun, Yu Maojie, Zhang Baoping, Yang Renzheng, Zou Wenlong, Liu Runxian, Zhang Wenhua, Wang Zonghuai, and Wang Rentang were previously accused by Zhang Zhongyuan and other woodware merchants in the city of corruption. After investigation by Prosecutor Zhu Xiyu of the District Prosecutor's Office, they were publicly prosecuted for corruption yesterday. The original prosecution roughly stated: "Gao Shijie, Xie Lianxun, Yu Maojie, Zhang Baoping, Yang Renzheng, Wang Rentang, Zou Wenlong, and the at-large Liu Runxian, Zhang Wenhua, and Wang Zonghuai are all auditors of the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. On August 15th of this year, in order to collect the first category of profit-seeking enterprise income tax for the 36th year, simplified collection procedures were implemented. It was stipulated that for each trade association with between 200 and 400 members, three companies would be sampled for every 100 members. The Shanghai Chinese Woodware Business Association has more than 250 members, and seven should be sampled. The bureau's sampling host put forward a list of 25 companies. Later, it was found that eight of them were not members of the industry, and they were eliminated after a statement. Therefore, 17 companies participated in the lottery. The seven companies that won the lottery were Zhang Senmao, Zhu Genji, Wufu, Yang Longxing, Zhang Wanli, and Zhang Wantai. On the 17th of the same month, the bureau notified the above-mentioned winning companies to bring their account books to the tax bureau on the morning of the 18th to wait for inspection. The bureau also assigned Zhang Baoping and Yu Maojie to check Zhang Senmao's account books by lottery, Yang Renzheng and Wang Zonghuai to check Yang Longxing's account books, Wang Rentang and Zhang Daru to check Zhang Wanli's account books, Liu Runxian and Zhang Wenhua to check Zhu Genji's account books, Wei Guangyu and Chen Zhijie to check Qiao Yuantai's account books, Jin Ruizhou and Li Yang to check Zhang Wantai's account books, and Gao Shijie and Xie Lianxun to check Wufu's account books. Because the account books prepared by the companies contained many errors and did not comply with accounting regulations, the auditors criticized them severely. When Zhang Xianliang, the manager of Zhang Senmao, explained to the auditors, Zou Wenlong heard the sound and came out. He learned that the account books of the companies all had major flaws and could be criticized, so he thought of taking the opportunity to extort. He first asked Zhang Xianliang if he knew any officials in the bureau who could be negotiated with. Zhang Xianliang named Zheng Gongda, a former employee of the bureau. Zou nodded, and then ordered Zhang to go back first. Immediately, he discussed the implementation of the extortion plan with Zhang Baoping, Yu Maojie, Wang Rentang, Liu Runxian, Zhang Wenhua, Gao Shijie, Xie Lianxun, and Yang Renzheng. They first warned the audit companies separately, saying that they had to pay supplementary taxes, ranging from 70 to 80 million to 100 million, in order to threaten them, and then reduced the price to extort money. It was also agreed that the Jinghua Restaurant would be the negotiation venue.</p>
<p>Negotiations at the Restaurant</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the same day at 5 pm, Zou Wenlong invited Zhang Xianliang to dinner at the Jinghua Restaurant in a common way. Zhang, forced by the situation, invited Yang Laoguan Niang, the owner of Yang Longxing, Zhu Jianni, the manager of Zhu Genji, Zhang Zhonghui, the head of Zhang Wanli, and Wang Yonglin to go with him. Zou Wenlong, Yu Maojie, Wang Rentang, Zhang Baoping, Yang Renzheng, Liu Runxian, and Zhang Wenhua also arrived one after another. Zou and Yu claimed to Zhang Xianliang that they had to pay at least 20 million. Later, Liu Runxian mediated and reduced it to 14 million, with half paying the tax and half serving as so-called entertainment fees. The Zhu Genji and Yang Longxing companies also did the same. Zhang Xianliang and others were intimidated by coercion and reluctantly agreed, but they insisted on paying 29 million for Zhang Wanli, which did not result and broke up. The Wufu auditors Gao Shijie and Xie Lianxun separately invited Cao Caigen, the manager of the company, to the Curry Restaurant, where Xie extorted 20 million and Gao reduced it to 14 million and stopped. Zhang Xianliang and Zhang Zhonghui reported Zou's extortion to Zhang Zhongyuan (the owner of Zhang Wanli), who in turn reported it to Speaker Pan and Senator Yang Fusheng of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Secretary Yan of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The next day, Wang Rentang invited Shen Wenbin, an employee of Zhang Wanli, to lunch at the Tsinghua Alumni Association. Shen then went with Zhang Xianliang, but they still insisted on extorting 29 million from Zhang Wanli. Later, they automatically reduced it to 23 million. Wang Rentang said that the payment must be made by the 21st at the latest.</p>
<p>Depositing the Money in the Bank</p>
<p>On the morning of the 21st at about 11 am, Zhang Zhongyuan handed two checks from the Dadae Bank issued by Taiqi Service Agency, one for 20 million and one for 30 million, to Zhu Jianni, the manager of Zhu Genji, and Zhang Xianliang, the manager of Zhang Senmao, for Zou Wenlong to receive in person, in order to obtain active evidence and provide it to the Council for inspection. Zou deposited all the check money into his own account under the name of Deng Chuanzhi at the Chengdu Commercial Bank, in order to calmly divide it up. After Yan Yuansheng learned from Zhang Zhongyuan about the extortion by the tax bureau auditors, he telegraphed the bureau director Lou Guowei on the 20th. After Lou received the news, he ordered the主管 personnel to investigate. Wang and Zou knew that the incident had been exposed, so they withdrew the original 50 million from Deng Chuanzhi's account at the Chengdu Commercial Bank on the 23rd. The tax bureau side was unable to understand the situation due to rumors, so it sent the bureau's supervisors Yu Boyan and Fan Anfu to inquire at each of the 本器 companies to see if there was any extortion by auditors. The companies, because the truth was not clear and they were afraid of causing misunderstandings, each made a statement certifying that there was no extortion.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance and the Jiangsu Supervisory Envoy's Office Thoroughly Investigated and Had Evidence</p>
<p>The newspapers were noisy, and the companies entrusted lawyers to send letters to the tax bureau, stating that the certification was invalid. The Ministry of Finance and the Jiangsu Supervisory Envoy's Office of the Supervisory Yuan also sent personnel to thoroughly investigate and had evidence. The tax bureau detained Zhang Baoping, Yu Maojie, Gao Shijie, Xie Lianxun, Yang Renzheng, Wang Rentang, and Zhang Daru, who were suspected of being involved, and transferred the files to the侦査 office. Zou Wenlong also surrendered himself after the incident. However, Liu Runxian, Zhang Wenhua, and Wang Zonghuai, who were also involved in the case, had all fled after hearing the news. After investigation, the evidence was indeed conclusive. The defendants were charged with the crimes of Article 28 of the Criminal Law and Article 1, Article 3, and Section 5 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Corruption. In addition to Fan Anfu, the supervisor of the bureau, and Zhang Daru, the auditor, who were not prosecuted due to insufficient suspicion of committing a crime, the public prosecution was filed in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Case Litigation Regulations and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>
<h3>Lou Guowei Did Not Arrive and Will Be Summoned Again</h3>

<h3>Winter Relief Fund Estimated at One Hundred Million</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The organization process and work outline of this year's winter relief committee in the city have been drafted by the Social Affairs Bureau and submitted to the municipal meeting on the 11th (Saturday) for discussion. The committee's work this year is scheduled to start in early November and end on March 15, 1937. The estimated cost is 10 billion yuan.

<h3>Anhui Suffers Severe Floods and Banditry A Fundraising Association Established for Relief</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Anhui natives in Shanghai Xu Jingren, Zhang Wenbai, Yang Xiaotian, Fang Xikong, etc., held a banquet at the Bankers Club yesterday noon for the heads of various agencies and business leaders in the city to discuss fundraising methods for relief due to the severe floods and banditry in the province. It was resolved to establish the Anhui Disaster Relief Fundraising Committee, nominating Xu Jingren as the chairman, Tu Yuesheng and other sixteen people as standing committee members, and Wang Xianqing as the director-general to actively carry out fundraising work.</p>
<h3>Kerosene Prices Also Rise Meeting Held at Any Time to Evaluate Prices in Case of Special Circumstances</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Fuel Group of the Shanghai Municipal Price Evaluation Council held its tenth evaluation meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau at 3 pm yesterday, deciding to adjust the negotiated price of kerosene. Starting this week, each barrel will be 2.2 million yuan (53 gallons per barrel, formerly 1.44 million yuan). Retail price is 6,000 yuan per liter (formerly 4,000 yuan).</p>
<p>The council also decided to adopt a flexible approach to kerosene pricing starting this week. In addition to the regular meetings every Thursday, meetings will be convened at any time to evaluate prices in case of special circumstances. Trade associations must report on the black market prices for the past week at the regular meetings every week as a reference for pricing, so that the negotiated price does not differ too much from the black market. According to the evaluation council, the reason why the kerosene negotiated price adopts a flexible approach is because the government cannot control or supply raw materials like sugar and coal, and hard control measures can be adopted. Various fuels are interrelated, and the actual supply and demand of kerosene are not balanced, so hard control cannot be enforced.</p>
<h3>Gasoline Prices Have Almost Doubled Should Be Corrected Immediately Senators Propose to Avoid Stimulating Prices</h3>
<p>Municipal Senators Wang Jian'e, Lu Shidao, Li Wenjie, Zhu Wende, Jiang Pingfan, etc., yesterday submitted an urgent proposal to Speaker Pan and Deputy Speaker Xu, requesting the municipal government to immediately telegraph the Central Bank to correct the measure of doubling the price of gasoline in order to avoid stimulating price increases. The original text of the proposal stated: "Since the Central Bank promulgated the gasoline restriction measures in this city, high-priced black market gasoline has immediately appeared. Fortunately, this council decided to stipulate four measures: private cars can purchase gasoline every three days, cargo trucks can purchase 20 gallons of gasoline every three days, and the number of refueling times per month shall not exceed ten times. Gasoline must be added to the fuel tank, and if there is any hoarding, it will be investigated according to the law. After the implementation of this case, those who manipulate and speculate will restrain themselves slightly. Unexpectedly, before the recess was ten days old, the Central Bank suddenly used the excuse of foreign exchange fluctuations and increased tax rates to increase the price of gasoline from 13,000 yuan per gallon to 25,500 yuan, almost doubling, not only despising the hard work of this council to stabilize prices, but also stimulating price increases, causing a major fluctuation in the market, and prices of rice and other necessities have risen accordingly. To say that this is vigorously implementing national policy and suppressing prices is obviously close to ridiculous. Therefore, it is urgently proposed that the speaker should inform the municipal government to immediately telegraph the Central Bank to stop the measure of doubling the price of gasoline in order to avoid stimulating price increases, otherwise, the Central Bank shall be responsible for all consequences."</p>

<h3>Seventeen Groups Including Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce Welcome Zhang Zhizhong and Chiang Ching-kuo, Attendance Exceeds 500, Situation is Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Seventeen groups including the Municipal Education Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Local Association, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the City Council, the General Labor Union, the Industrial Association, the Women's Association, the Money Trade Association, the Banking Association, the Municipal Fishermen's Association, the Municipal Farmers' Association, the Lawyers Association, the Accountants Association, the Journalists Association, the Newspaper Trade Association, and the Sixth District Cotton Textile Industry Association held a grand tea party at Lido Garden yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to welcome Zhang Zhizhong and Chiang Ching-kuo, who were visiting Shanghai. Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, Fang Zhi, Wu Kaixian, Zhu Ping, Yan Zhuang, Xu Jiqi, and Shui Xiangyun all attended, with more than 500 people present.</p>
<p>Commanded the Two Shanghai Battles</p>
<p>After the music played and the meeting began, Chairman Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech, saying: "It is a rare grand gathering today that brings together people from all walks of life in Shanghai, including agriculture, industry, academia, and commerce. Recalling that Shanghai played an important role in both the January 28th Incident and the August 13th all-out war of resistance, both battles were commanded and led by General Zhang. After the Battle of Shanghai, it was stipulated that Shanghai would not be defended, so General Zhang devoted himself to the deployment around Shanghai. Because of the preparations made in peacetime, he was able to counterattack the enemy in the early stages of the war of resistance. Shanghai was able to support the glorious war of resistance for three months, laying the foundation for victory. General Zhang's planning is truly admirable. Recalling the period of the War of Resistance in Shanghai, the citizens of Shanghai fully supplied and became one with the soldiers. Thinking of this scene today, it is still vivid in my mind. Now that the communist bandits are rebelling and hindering the country's revival, welcoming General Zhang today is truly filled with mixed feelings.</p>
<p>Leading Young People with Special Effort</p>
<p>As for Chiang Ching-kuo, his research abroad and his spirit of service after returning to China are admirable. In particular, the construction of "New Jiangnan," setting an example, and establishing a new atmosphere are well known. Today, everyone is talking about reforming the political and social atmosphere. In addition to Chairman Chiang's leadership, local cadres must work together. Chiang's political achievements in Jiangnan can serve as a model for local politics. In addition, Chiang has made special efforts to lead young people and has a strong interest in doing so. Now that Chiang has taken a position in the central government, he should be able to guide young people under the correct policy, creating cadres with new aspirations to take on the tasks of the second phase of the revolution. The hopes of the country are truly tied to this. The one million young people in Shanghai all have the ambition to serve the country, so they have deep expectations for Chiang. Chiang was ordered to come to Shanghai to guide the merger of the party and the group. Soon, two revolutionary groups with common beliefs, common history, and common leaders will be merged into one to complete the task of nation-building."</p>
<p>Correct and Improve General Atmosphere</p>
<p>After the Chairman's speech, General Zhang Zhizhong was invited to speak amidst enthusiastic applause. He first expressed his gratitude to all sectors of Shanghai and said: "The ancients said, 'Compete for fame in the court, compete for profit in the market.' The people of Shanghai are so busy, it's all for profit. Countries with industries and commerce do not shy away from profit. Shanghai is undoubtedly a big market, and seeking profit is a matter of course. However, the 'profit' sought should benefit the public, benefit the working masses, and, more importantly, benefit the country and the nation. Only then is it a true and legitimate profit. To resist the intrusion of a kind of 'ideology,' each advanced country has its own set of methods. What our country relies on is the Principle of People's Livelihood and modern social policies. After arriving in Shanghai, I have been to theaters, cafes, and dance halls. I have also visited the Tomb of Anonymous Heroes of the Battle of Shanghai and witnessed the lives of the villagers. I deeply feel that the distance between the lifestyles of the people of Shanghai should be shortened, or even eliminated altogether. Shanghai must move forward with the giant wheel of history. Leaders from all walks of life can guide the people, correct and improve the general atmosphere, and make a great contribution to the future of the country."</p>
<p>Call for Development and Construction of the Northwest</p>
<p>Zhang then made a call for the Northwest, saying that compared with the Southeast, Northeast, and Southwest, the Northwest provinces have the weakest foundation, and the people's lives are nearly a century behind the Southeast. He hoped that the Shanghai business community and the national business community could devote a portion of their efforts to developing and building the Northwest. After Zhang finished speaking, Chiang Ching-kuo was invited to speak. His words were very brief and humble, saying that he had made no contribution to the country and was not qualified to be welcomed. Today, he was actually joining all sectors of Shanghai in welcoming General Zhang Zhizhong. However, the kindness and hospitality of all sectors would only encourage him to work harder. Finally, Fang Zhi gave a speech, praising the achievements of Zhang and Chiang. The grand meeting finally ended at 5:45 PM amidst military music.</p>
<h3>Problems with Goods Without Permits: Zhang Jia Requested Instructions in Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Reliable sources report that the unauthorized plan to handle goods based on the principles agreed upon by the Executive Yuan was subsequently intensified due to the soaring black market exchange rate. Zhang Jiaao, Governor of the Central Bank, went to Beijing yesterday to request instructions on this matter. It is reported that Governor Zhang told representatives of the import and export industry that the principles determined by the Executive Yuan were too unified, while the plan drafted by the Central Bank was too harsh and detailed. He personally advocated a compromise solution, handling goods separately according to their nature, and guaranteeing a solution in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>Two Small Planes Arrive in Shanghai After Adventure, Encounter Storm Over Zhejiang, Communications Cut Off, Nearly Lost</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Two Piper Cub-style small airplanes circumnavigating the world safely landed at Longhua Airport in this city at 5:12 PM yesterday afternoon. The two planes were piloted by American pilots Evans and Truman. They took off from the United States on August 10, passed through London, crossed the English Channel, and stopped briefly in the Netherlands before flying to Hong Kong via the Near East route a week ago. Due to unfavorable coastal weather, they stayed in Hong Kong for many days. They ventured to fly north on the 4th of this month and encountered a strong storm after passing Shantou, forcing them to land in Xiamen. During this period, the Guam typhoon landed near Chaozhou and Shantou, and the coastal area was plagued by wind and rain, so they were stranded in Xiamen for three days. However, because the facilities at Xiamen Airport were not good, the two decided to leave Xiamen and come north yesterday when the weather turned clear. They took off from Xiamen at 9:20 AM yesterday morning and arrived over Zhejiang at around 12:00 PM. Unexpectedly, they encountered a strong sea storm and thick clouds again. The two planes lurched left and right, almost losing their direction. At that time, communication with the Shanghai ground was cut off for more than three hours, until around 4:00 PM in the afternoon when they finally escaped the dangerous situation and flew directly to Shanghai. The two planes have abundant fuel reserves, the cabin seats only two people side by side, and the performance of the fuselage is still excellent. According to Evans, the purpose of this trip is to test whether small aircraft can travel long distances, so all driving, communications, repairs and other work during the journey are undertaken by one person. Because their passports still need to be re-signed after arriving in Shanghai, they may delay their departure from Shanghai until tomorrow. It is still undecided whether they will go to the Ryukyu Islands or directly to Tokyo after leaving Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Shandong Battlefield From Military Victory to Political Competition Two Major Events</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Jinan, Shandong, 5th] Two major events have occurred on the Shandong battlefield in the past half month: one is that the National Army formally recovered Yantai at 9:30 AM on the 1st of this month, and the other is that Chen Yi's remaining main force, unable to withstand the pressure of the National Army, had to abandon its Shandong base area, which it had painstakingly managed for 20 years, and flee south to the border area of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu.</p>
<p>The important position that Yantai occupies in the strategic plans of the communist bandits is known to all. It is the transportation hub between the Shandong communist bandits and the Northeast communist bandits. The Shandong manpower and food, and the Northeast weapons and ammunition, are mainly transported from here. The recovery of Yantai is undoubtedly a failure of the communist bandits' overall strategy and the elimination of the fatal crisis to national unity and construction since the end of the War of Resistance. Its significance far exceeds any previous battle in the country, even the Yan'an battle.</p>
<p>As the "Commander of the Shandong Military Region," Chen Yi, of course, realized this long ago. Therefore, around September 20, he first concentrated two columns that had been transferred north from Jingzhong and completed training in the Yellow River (later increased to four), and together with the remnants of the five columns originally based in southwestern Shandong, launched another large-scale counterattack on Jining City, attempting to occupy the city and then move northeast to the Yimeng Mountain area to contain the flank of the National Army attacking Yantai. However, this was first met with a head-on blow from the National Army's Qiu Qingquan and Wu Huawen troops. After suffering more than 10,000 casualties, the bandit army had to change its plan and flee south across the Longhai Line from Cao County on the 25th and 26th.</p>
<p>Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu Border Area</p>
<p>Although the westward fleeing force has joined forces with Liu Bocheng, its plan to ensure Yantai, contain the National Army, and re-enter the Yimeng Mountain area has obviously completely failed.</p>
<p>As of the time this reporter is writing this article, the East China Field Army, commanded by Chen Yi and expanded into 14 columns (including the 1st to 13th columns, missing the 5th column, the Rapid Column, and the Guangdong-Guangxi Column), has seven relatively decent columns that have fled Shandong with Chen Yi. In addition, there are seven columns left in Shandong. Among these seven columns, one Guangdong-Guangxi Column was originally stationed in Huimin, northern Shandong, and has recently moved to Dezhou on the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. Four other columns are surrounded by the National Army in the narrow area between Changyi, Zuoshan, and Tingkou. The other two columns, after covering Chen Yi's main force fleeing south in southwestern Shandong, have been forced by the National Army to flee north to Liangshan Village, the old nest of Song Jiang. The total strength of these seven columns is only 50,000 people. (Note: Chen Yi's army is organized with each column having a force of 25,000 to 30,000 people.) In addition,</p>
<p>Communist Bandits in Shandong</p>
<p>According to recent surveys: Local teams on the north bank of the Yellow River: Shouzhang has 10,000 people, Acheng has an independent brigade, Liaocheng has 1,000, Renping has 3,000, Qiqing has two regiments between Renping, Zhaihe has two regiments between Yucheng, Huimin has 2,000, Tizikou in northeastern Shandong has 3,000. All logistics equipment in Huimin, originally the supply center for the communist bandits in northern Shandong, has recently begun to be withdrawn. Central Shandong: Qin'an and Laiwu have 1,000, Culaishan has 2,000, Dawenkou East has 1,000, Laiwu Southeast has three regiments, Liuchuan East Dahezhuang has one regiment. Jiangyu West has two regiments, Anqiu Southwest Qinge Village has one regiment, Anqiu Southeast Jingzhi has one regiment. Southern Shandong: Fei County and Xiangcheng have the remnants of three divisions of Zhang Guangzhong's forces lurking between them. North of the Jiaoji Railway and Jiaodong: Zhangqiu East has 500, Boxing and Huantai have 1,000, Huantai Southeast has one regiment, Guangrao South has 1,000, Guangrao Northeast has two regiments, Changyi North has two regiments, Pingdu South has 8,000, Yixian Northeast Zhuqiao Town has one brigade, Gu Xian East has two regiments, Laiyang East has one division, Juchi Yasha has one brigade and two regiments, Haiyang and Weihaiwei each have 2,000, Wendeng has 7,000.</p>
<p>The total number of local teams of the Shandong communists above is four dilapidated divisions, three brigades, 21 regiments, and another 44,500 people. If each regiment is counted as 1,000 people and the dilapidated brigades and divisions are counted as 5,000 people, the total is about 100,000 people. If this number is added to the strength of the seven remaining columns, the total is only 150,000 people. Therefore, compared with the situation at the beginning of this year, when there were 430,000 regular troops and 113 independent regiments (i.e., militia), Shandong will enter a pacification war phase in the future. To achieve the smooth completion of the pacification mission,</p>
<p>The Main Key</p>
<p>Naturally lies not in the military, but in the strengthening of political competition!</p>
<p>By the time this article meets the reader, the part of Shandong south of the Yellow River is likely to have only three counties remaining, (Haiyang, Wendeng, Rongcheng) and one city, (Weihaiwei) also in the hands of the National Army. The northern Shandong part of the north bank of the Yellow River, due to its flat terrain, is ideal for the National Army's mechanized units to move and gallop. In addition, under the "empty city tactics" currently implemented by the communist bandits, the strength of the communist bandits in northern Shandong is only one column of regular troops, one brigade of local troops, four regiments, and 19,000 militiamen. Therefore, after the Jiaodong battle comes to an end, the National Army can not only recover northern Shandong at any time, but also open up the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway at any time. The focus of the current problem is that the National Army's current strategy is still not on the gains and losses of one city or one place, or the opening of one railway, but mainly on concentrating superior forces to capture the main force of the communist bandits, conduct a decisive battle, and give them a destructive blow!

<h3>Yangtze River Vessels Prohibited from Sailing on the North Bank</h3>
<p>Reeds on the Riverbank to be Cut Down</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Wuxi, 9th] The bandit situation in Jiangbei is trending towards tension again. Bandit traces have been found everywhere in villages near Guangling Town, Xiamupo, in the Jingtai area. The bandit Su Yu's troops have arrived south of Hai'an, attempting to flee south. The Nanjing Garrison Headquarters ordered all troops that, except for open ports, no Yangtze River vessels are allowed to sail or dock on the north bank. Also: After County Magistrate Xu and Staff Officer Zhu of the Fortress Headquarters inspected the river along the coast, in order to prevent bandits from hiding, they ordered the reeds on the riverbank to be cut down as much as possible.</p>

<h3>Changshu Implements Joint Defense Along the River</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Changshu, 8th] The county government received an order from Provincial Chairman Wang, with important instructions on the current defense situation.

The curfew time was moved forward, and patrols were conducted seriously. All entertainment venues were restricted from closing at 10:30 PM, and all factory workers and school students were notified that they were not allowed to strike. Anyone who abets or attempts to disrupt public order will be investigated and punished severely. In the event of an emergency, necessary measures should be taken in advance, and temporary martial law should be declared. Local party, government, military, and civilian party organs should cooperate sincerely to pacify the bandit atmosphere and achieve the mission of suppression. In order to implement the resolutions of the county's public security meeting, the police bureau will convene a meeting to decide on the strict enforcement of the curfew. After midnight, no traffic is allowed, and those responsible for public security must also hold a curfew pass for inspection.</p>
<h3>Deliberately Plotting to Disrupt Public Order, Hand Grenade Found in Wuxi Cinema</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Wuxi] At around 3:00 PM on the 7th, a wooden-handled hand grenade was suddenly found under the seat in the 13th row from the front right during the screening of "Bitter Love" at the Wuxi Grand Theater in the park. The grenade cover had been opened and could be triggered with a touch. The audience was immediately shocked and order was disrupted. The Southern District Gendarmerie rushed to suppress the situation and restored peace, and took the hand grenade back to the team.

<h3>Interrogating a Water Monster!</h3>
<p>Deafened in both ears, full of grief, speaks fluent Cantonese, wanders everywhere.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch from Wujin, 8th] The county previously had a water monster panic for a time, but the city newspaper exposed the inside story, and the police team's prevention was effective, and the matter was finally put to rest. Unexpectedly, the Zhenchang Danyang Headquarters arrested an unnamed man who did not speak in Menghe. Because he was arrested by the water's edge, he was suspected of being a water monster. After being transferred to the county government for interrogation and transferred to the period, he did not say a word about anything. Everyone thought he was a water monster and spread the word for a while. On the 6th, the county military court brought him for interrogation. He confessed in fluent Cantonese, which was impossible to understand. The military judge temporarily asked He Tianmin, director of the health center, to act as an interpreter before learning that his name was Shao Rongqing, a native of Chaozhou, Guangdong, 38 years old. He was conscripted and left his hometown, traveled from Guangdong and Guangxi to Shandong. Due to his participation in the war, he was deafened in both ears and was removed from the army. He began to beg along the way. Also, because of the different languages and severe hearing loss, he was called a water monster. His expression was depressed, as if he had unlimited grief. The military court ordered the 3rd District of Menghe, where the case occurred, to investigate the matter within three days.</p>

The case is scheduled to be publicly tried on the 16th.</p>
<h3>Wasteland Reclaimed into Tea Fields: Taiwan Tea on the Road to Increased Production</h3>
<p>[Our Taipei Dispatch, 4th] Tea, one of Taiwan's special products, is the only product among the Chenglin Four Companies that holds greater promise. This is determined by the adjustment of international market exchange rates and the internal efforts of tea companies.</p>
<p>Taiwan tea is not a high-grade tea, but black tea, due to its good variety and rich color, can fetch US$0.45 per pound in the US export market, accounting for 30% of purchases. Oolong tea, because Taiwan does not have specialized personnel stationed in the US to repackage it into small packages and promote it to three restaurants, the market appears stagnant. Tea companies have more than 2 million pounds of unsold stock from last year, and there are still no customers. This compels the tea industry to move towards the pure production of black tea.</p>
<p>Tea Plantations Throughout the Province</p>
<p>In the past, there were 45,000 jia (each jia is approximately equivalent to 14 mu or more), now there are 38,000 jia. The highest production record during the Japanese occupation was 25 million pounds. The provincial tea company only owns 3,000 jia of tea plantations, of which 2,400 jia have been restored, and 600 jia are still awaiting reclamation. Last year's production was 1 million pounds, and this year it is increasing to approximately 2 million pounds. (The province's total tea production was 6 million pounds last year, with the company accounting for one-sixth; this year's production is 10 million pounds, with the company accounting for one-fifth.) This demonstrates that the private sector in Taiwan tea has an absolute advantage. The government not only does not attempt to control it, but also supports it with practical measures such as loans and fertilizer, turning wasteland into tea country.</p>
<p>Taiwan Tea Company</p>
<p>Has six tea farms, including ten crude processing plants and three refined processing plants, which are the legacy of the Japanese zaibatsu Mitsui in Taiwan. The Japanese used political pressure to deal with tea farmers, designating a certain mountain range or plain and forcing a certain tea farmer to be responsible. The tea farmers were laborers hired by the capitalists, subject to the control and exploitation of the capitalists, and their lives were miserable. After the restoration, the company changed its business model, entrusting all tea plantations to tea farmers and assisting them in cultivating and fertilizing. It then purchased the tea from them at a minimum price of 35 yuan per catty. For five years, the company annually received substandard tea, which was actually insufficient for the company to pay land taxes. However, the tea farmers had to sell their entire crop to the company, which was clearly a loss, but directly encouraged tea farmers to actively increase production.</p>
<p>On the 4th, a reporter took a special car to Sanxia in central Taiwan and visited the tea manufacturing plants and directly interviewed the tea farmers. According to Plant Manager Shen, the plant produced 300,000 pounds last year, but this year it has increased to 900,000 pounds. As long as the tea plantation is expanded and fertilizer is provided, the Japanese record of 1.3 million pounds can be broken within one or two years. In the southern subtropical village, when the reporter interviewed tea farmer Jin Fang, who cultivates 15 jia of tea, he also said that there is hope to expand the tea plantation so that more than half of the 130 households in the village can have the right to inherit the tea fields. (Currently, it is limited to the old tea farmers from the Japanese occupation period). The tea farmers of the Taiwan Tea Company are happy. As long as they are given practical benefits, they are willing to use their blood and sweat to harvest the aroma of tea. No wonder tea experts from Java, when coming to Taiwan to investigate, also praised this method.</p>
<p>Chen Weizhen, the general manager of the tea company, is a hard-working industry researcher. He said that the state-owned, privately-operated tea planting method can achieve the goal of increasing production. The company is now making every effort to increase production and is also inviting experts to conduct special research and exchange technical skills and practical experience with tea farms in the mainland. Accompanying the reporters on the visit were also Vice Admiral Yang Xuancheng, who participated in the Zhushi Conference and the surrender ceremony on the USS Missouri and is currently a consultant to the provincial government. In the future, he will devote himself to the agricultural, forestry, and labor force in Taiwan Province. (Special Correspondent Jiang)</p>
<h3>Taiwan's Top Female War Criminal Xu Yuye Tried in Taipei Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Shenzhou News Agency, Taipei, 9th] Xu Yuye, Taiwan's number one female war criminal, who was regarded by the overseas Chinese in Penang as a阎王, served as a Japanese military police translator during the occupation of Penang, indiscriminately arresting overseas Chinese en masse and killing them. On April 20th of this year, Xu Yuye returned to Taiwan from Penang and was arrested after being reported. Today, she was tried in the war crimes tribunal.

<p>Zhang Naifan Inspects Hairu</p>
<p>[Our Nantong Dispatch, 7th] Commissioner Zhang Naifan returned to Tong on the 6th after inspecting Rugao and Hai'an and expressed the following impressions from the inspection: The self-defense forces in various districts of Rugao are quite strong. Many invading bandit troops have been resisted by the self-defense forces. Currently, 70-80% of the entire territory is under control. The county's education has always been developed, and now 150-160 elementary schools have been restored. However, there are only one county high school, one private high school, and one provincial normal school, which is still considered insufficient. The household registration survey has been completed, and land registration work is being actively carried out. Conscription work has also been completed. The election rosters will be reported within days. He also stated that Rugao's performance is considered excellent among the counties in the pacification zone, and most of the district chiefs are also capable of practical work. He will go to Haimen for inspection on the 8th, and then go to Qidong and Jingjiang.</p>

<h3>Embezzlement of Grain Occurs at Jinshan Luxiang Storage Warehouse: Manager Zhang Yifei on the Run</h3>
<p>[Our Jinshan Dispatch, 7th] The Jinshan County Judiciary interrogated the case of embezzlement of grain at the Second Storage Warehouse in Luxiang Township on the 6th. According to Gu Wangshu, the director of the local field grain office, "When Manager Zhang Yifei took office on April 30th, there were 109 dan of rice in storage. On August 19th, he jointly submitted a report stating that there was a shortage of rice and alleging that Yuan Da Rice Shop was suspected of fraud. When the warehouse was inspected on September 9th, there was a shortage of 36 shi and 6 dou. The township government and security squadron sent personnel to the scene at the time." Subsequently, Ruan Zhigang, the manager of Yuan Da Rice Shop, stated, "Although the rice stored in the warehouse belonged to our shop, it was managed by Manager Zhang. After the shortage, Zhang asked Squad Leader Yuan to mediate with our shop. The two agreed to each bear half of the compensation; otherwise, they would report the case to the county and request an arrest warrant, etc., but we did not pay attention to it." Director Gu also stated that Zhang escaped without a trace on the 18th. The court will conduct further inquiries.</p>

<h3>Simplification of Cotton Yarn and Cloth Registration Procedures in This City - Textile Adjustment Committee Decides - Cotton Allocation by the Executive Yuan Limited to Yarn Factories in Seven Provinces/Cities Including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The thirteenth regular meeting of the Textile Adjustment Committee was held at the committee's conference room yesterday afternoon starting at 4:30 PM. Many committee members attended. Acting Chairman Liú Sìyīng presided. Discussions continued until 7:30 PM. Important resolutions are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Approved the purchase price of cotton yarn and its grading calculation method.</p>
<p>(2) The originally proposed Shanghai cotton yarn inventory registration method was deemed too cumbersome. It was resolved to entrust three committee members, Gāo Bǐngtài, Wú Wèijīng, and Liú Jìngjī, to simplify it. It would then be submitted to Acting Chairman Liú for approval before implementation.</p>
<p>(3) Approved the "Executive Yuan Cotton Allocation and Yarn Delivery Method." Key points are as follows: The cotton allocation will follow the second allocation method for foreign cotton, based on the number of spindles at the time. After calculation by this committee, it will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for allocation. Small factories with fewer than 3,000 spindles that can spin 20-count yarn and whose quality meets the committee's inspection standard of Grade D or above will also be allocated cotton. However, each factory must pre-pay a portion of the 20-count yarn to the government as a guarantee. Cotton allocation will be limited to yarn factories in seven provinces/cities: Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Tianjin, Qingdao, Taiwan, and Guangzhou. Other regions will no longer be allocated cotton, as raw materials can be sourced locally. Factories that fail to deliver the cotton yarn spun on behalf of others from the first quarter's foreign cotton on schedule will not be allocated cotton by the Executive Yuan this time. Cotton allocation applicants must have guarantees from two yarn factories. Only yarn factories with more than 10,000 spindles are qualified to provide guarantees. All cotton yarn spun on behalf of others by factories must be delivered directly to this committee, then transferred to the National Bank. The yarn delivery period will commence in January of the 37th year and will be completed in three months.</p>
<p>(4) Approved the organizational regulations of the Textile Export Committee. The regulations regarding the committee's tasks are as follows: Approve the quantity and ratio of exported yarn and cloth. Determine the quality standards for exported yarn and cloth. Formulate methods and regulations related to yarn and cloth barter trade. Investigate the export situation of national and private yarn and cloth export organizations. Stipulate the types of imported materials exchanged for exported yarn and cloth and the conditions for exchange. Handle yarn and cloth export procedures. Determine the export price of yarn and cloth. Determine the liability for profits and losses from direct yarn and cloth exports. Allocate funds related to yarn and cloth exports. Investigate foreign markets and yarn and cloth prices, provide reports or suggestions to relevant authorities regarding export policies to be adopted. Other matters related to yarn and cloth exports.</p>

The closing price for 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn fell below the 30 million yuan mark, reaching 29.6 million yuan, a further decrease of 900,000 yuan from the previous day. 20-count Extra Double Horse and Light Double Horse both fell by 700,000 yuan. 16-count Guangming also saw a small decrease of 600,000 yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn fell across the board by 5-600,000 to 8-900,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Rises</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market opened yesterday with slow customer buying and market participants adopting a wait-and-see approach. Prices initially declined across the board. However, at 9:30 AM, upon hearing of the rise in foreign exchange rates, cotton cloth prices turned from weak to firm. As a result, fine cloths in each category rose by 5,000 to 24,500 yuan compared to the previous day. Printed calico saw strong sales, and prices also rose by around 30,000 yuan. Bleached cloth and shilin cloth were both popular, while other cloths saw mixed price movements.</p>

<p>Spot Cotton Continues to Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market continued to be weak, but trading was active. Traders' confidence was soft due to the decline in yarn and cloth prices, and speculators rushed to sell. Yarn factories took advantage of the lower prices to buy, and out-of-town buyers also stepped up to purchase, resulting in high transaction volumes across the board. Prices were down by 4-50,000 yuan compared to the previous day, with a total transaction volume of over 3,000 bales.</p>

<h3>Ladies, Do You Know How to Use Milk Powder to Breastfeed?</h3>
<p>— Sū Zēngxiáng</p>
<p>Out of natural love and one's own responsibility, a mother should breastfeed her baby after birth, for at least five months, three months, or even just two weeks. This is because breast milk is suitable for the baby's constitution, clean, easy to digest, nutritious, and resistant to disease. This is a well-recognized fact by many scholars and does not need further elaboration.</p>
<p>However, there are unforeseen circumstances, such as the mother having a serious illness, or a real lack of breast milk and difficulty in finding a good wet nurse. In these cases, artificial nutrition must be used.</p>
<p>If artificial nutrition is used properly, the results can be very good. It is better to use cow's milk or milk powder than to underfeed with insufficient breast milk, leading to a sallow complexion and thinness.</p>
<p>Many people ask me how to mix milk powder. Ladies! Let me tell you, add two liang (approximately 60 cc) of boiled water to each spoonful of milk powder and mix well. This creates a composition similar to fresh cow's milk. This is the basic principle, remember it! Also, canned milk (not condensed milk, condensed milk is not good), also known as Evaporated Milk, take one part milk and an equal amount of water (half and half), which is also the equivalent of fresh cow's milk. Following this principle, you can achieve the same effect whether you use fresh cow's milk, mixed milk powder, or canned milk.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about dosage. To know the dosage, you must first know the baby's weight. From birth until the baby reaches five kilograms (i.e., babies weighing five kilograms or less), the actual amount of milk they need daily (i.e., pure milk) is equal to one-tenth of their weight. For babies over five kilograms, the actual amount of milk they need daily is also equal to one-tenth of their weight. However, for babies weighing five kilograms or less, the milk should be diluted with an equal amount of very thin rice water (also known as "milk-broth"). For babies weighing over five kilograms, the milk should be diluted with one-third very thin rice water (also known as "milk-broth").</p>
<p>For example, if a baby weighs three kilograms (three kilograms, i.e., three thousand grams, equals 6.6 pounds), the daily requirement for pure milk is 300 grams (approximately a little over ten liang), plus 300 grams of very thin rice water, mixed and fed. The total amount of 600 grams should be divided into five to six feedings per day.</p>
<p>For example, if a baby weighs six kilograms (six kilograms, i.e., six thousand grams, equals 13.3 pounds), the milk requirement is still 600 grams. But at this time, the thin rice water added should only be one-third of the milk amount, i.e., 200 grams (i.e., the "milk-broth" mentioned above). 600 plus 200 equals 800 grams (i.e., 800 cc). At this time, the baby is gradually growing, and it is not enough to just drink milk. Therefore, feeding should only be done four times a day, 200 cc each time (between six and a half to seven liang). However, in addition to milk, the baby must be given thicker foods to ensure sufficient nutrition and to prevent the stomach from becoming excessively enlarged by only drinking liquids. This food is called puree. Initially, it should be given once a day, using six liang of milk plus one tablespoon of Cream of Wheat or two tablespoons of Pabeum (available in foreign goods stores). At this time, the child is about three and a half months old.</p>
<p>After four months, give the baby vegetable puree once a day, puree once a day, and milk three times a day. Each puree or other puree (puree is puree) can be given in a small bowl (200 grams), and milk should be given in amounts of six to seven liang each time, no more than that, until six months.</p>
<p>After six months, healthy children can eat pure milk (i.e., fresh cow's milk without water or rice water, or milk powder mixed with two liang of boiled water per tablespoon, both of which are pure milk, as mentioned above). The number of feedings should be gradually reduced and replaced with thicker purees until one year old.</p>
<p>Sugar has a certain amount of calories and also contains powdered carbohydrates. If used in moderation, it can increase weight and promote bowel movements. The old habit of thinking that sugar can produce phlegm is a mistake. The amount of sugar that should be added to ordinary milk is about 5% (five percent). For example, for every one and a half liang of milk and one and a half liang of thin rice water, totaling three liang, one teaspoon of white sugar should be added (one teaspoon equals five grams), and so on. Sugar can only be reduced during diarrhea or excessively loose stools.</p>
<p>The old-fashioned milk cake can be used, but the nutrition is too one-sided and insufficient. If two or three spoons of milk powder can be added during cooking, it can become a nutritious food.</p>
<p>In addition to drinking milk, a small amount of boiled water should also be given daily (starting from birth). Babies who are one month old can eat orange juice, vegetable soup, etc., to increase vitamin C. Babies who are two months old should be given cod liver oil to prevent rickets.</p>
<p>Recent research by American university professors has found that meat juice can be fed to babies as early as two weeks old, which is very helpful for the baby's development. The nutrition of babies must be considered from multiple aspects. Parents should know to improve the diet of babies over one year old who are still only eating milk.</p>
<p>Young ladies! For the sake of the future of the country and the nation, for the sake of your own happiness and joy, I hope you will have a healthy and lively baby. To make it clear to you, I have written repeatedly in detail, hoping you won't say I am too verbose, right?</p>
<h3>The Prognosis and Nursing of Typhoid Patients</h3>
<p>— Xie Junshou</p>
<p>(Continued from previous) In cases where underlying conditions like heart disease, lung disease (tuberculosis, pneumonia), diabetes, and nephritis are present, the prognosis is generally poor.</p>
<p>The early onset of bedsores, a rapid and weak pulse, and a significant decrease in white blood cell count also indicate danger.</p>
<p>Regarding the mortality rate of typhoid patients, it is closely related to the environment. The most important factor is the availability of sanitary facilities in the area. If there is a reliable supply of clean water and a well-functioning sewage disposal system, the number of typhoid patients will naturally decrease significantly. Although Berlin, Germany, had a water supply system (i.e., running water) as early as 1856, the number of typhoid deaths did not decrease until a sewage system was implemented in 1875. From that point onwards, the mortality rate gradually declined. Initially, there were 80-85 deaths per 100,000 people. But from 1875-1879, it decreased to 42. By 1900-1902, it was only four. Secondly, wealth is also a factor. Rosemfeld's survey in Vienna showed that the mortality rate in wealthy districts was 16.5-19.74%, while in poor districts it was 24.6-22.19%.</p>
<p>Nursing of Typhoid Patients</p>
<p>Nursing is just as important as medical treatment for typhoid patients. If nursing care is inadequate, it can often lead to serious consequences. Therefore, some people say that nursing typhoid patients is sometimes even more important than the doctor, because there is currently no specific drug for typhoid fever. It is not easy to carefully and safely navigate through this long and dangerous period of one or two months. The following points are now listed in detail:</p>
<p>Quiet: Mental and physical rest is an important condition for typhoid patients. Bed rest can not only prevent intestinal perforation and intestinal bleeding, but also, because typhoid patients have a weakened heart after prolonged fever, movement is very dangerous. The author encountered such an incident last month: a fourteen-year-old boy had typhoid fever, but his temperature was not very high, so the family did not pay much attention to it. At the end of the second week, he went to see a doctor. When they picked him up, the patient felt unable to cope. In an instant, his face turned pale, and his breathing and pulse stopped immediately. By the time the author was called, the patient had already passed away. What was the reason for this? It was due to acute paralysis caused by a weakened heart. There is also a case where the fever has subsided completely, but sudden sitting up causes heart paralysis and death. Therefore, typhoid patients should eat, urinate, and defecate in bed and should not move around.</p>
<p>Diet: The lesion in typhoid patients is in the small intestine, so special attention should be paid to the diet. However, according to our country's customs, typhoid patients are excessively restricted in their diet. There is a saying, "Typhoid is never starved to death," which is also unreasonable. Because the patient has a long-term fever, the body consumes a lot of nutrients. If these are not replenished, the patient will not have enough nutrition, and recovery will be delayed. Historically, people have been very wary of solid foods. In fact, when food reaches the jejunum, it has already become chyme-like and has no stimulating effect. Some people have experimented with solid foods during the feverish stage of typhoid fever and have not seen an increase in relapse or intestinal bleeding. Therefore, although we do not need to advocate solid foods for typhoid patients to avoid accidents, it is important to fully replenish them. It is best to choose easily digestible foods that do not irritate the intestines during the fever period, and to adjust them according to individual preferences. During the fever period, use some rice soup, lotus root flour, fish, eggs, and thick soup made from boiled potatoes and radishes. When the fever subsides, gradually switch to other foods.</p>
<p>Preventing Bedsores: Because patients are bedridden for a long time, they are prone to developing bedsores. Therefore, the bedding should be flat and wrinkle-free. Critically ill patients should lie on air mattresses or water beds, and use ice packs or ice pillows on their heads. Although typhoid patients should lie on their backs, they can often lie on their sides to prevent bedsores. Use air cushions or alcohol to clean the skin in areas that are easily compressed.</p>
<p>The mouth should be kept clean. Wash or gargle with boric acid water three times a day to prevent otitis media and parotitis. For dry lips, apply 1% boric acid honey or boric acid glycerin.</p>
<p>Hair, skin, nails, etc. should be kept clean. Chinese people often neglect the cleanliness of patients, which is a serious mistake, because patients excrete more waste than normal people.</p>
<p>After the fever subsides, patients can sit up after two weeks. If they feel dizzy or uncomfortable, they should be prohibited. Then, gradually stand up and walk.</p>
<p>Mental excitement, long conversations with visitors, and reading should also be prohibited.</p>
<p>During the recovery period, patients should also rest quietly and then engage in work, otherwise, early work may lead to severe neurasthenia.</p>
<p>Supplementation of vitamins A, B, and C is of course also necessary for patients. (End of series)</p>
<h3>Key Points of School Hygiene (1)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>For children's physical health, the most important thing is family and school hygiene. Today's educators mostly lack an emphasis on school hygiene facilities. It is not known that if the hygienic foundation of children is not consolidated during the growth period, it will greatly affect their future health. The important points to pay attention to in school hygiene are nothing more than: the completeness of the school's sanitary equipment, especially the cleanliness of the school buildings, the cleanliness of the bodies of children entering school, and the maintenance of cleanliness inside and outside the school. 1. Rest rooms, medical rooms, air baths, open-air classrooms, recuperation homes, shower rooms, and warm bathrooms must be set up in the school. 2. The teaching materials must have the instillation of health knowledge and the method of cultivating health habits. 3. When implementing physical education teaching materials, it is necessary to pay attention to the degree of children's physical strength and weakness, and to apply appropriate teaching materials. Those with weak bodies must not be forced to practice strenuous exercises. 4. The contact between the hygiene of the school and the family is especially important for those with weak bodies. Any shortcomings that need to be corrected as a result of the health check must be notified to their parents or guardians. Special communication is especially important regarding nutrition, sleep, rest, family work, and usual illnesses. 5. Weak children must receive sunbathing, air baths, showers, and warm baths. 6. The application of ultraviolet light treatment, such as the irradiation of artificial sun lamps. 7. The application of cod liver oil and its preparations (vitamin pills and drops) to weak children has a great effect on the nutrition of the body.</p>
<p>(A) Sunbathing</p>
<p>Sunbathing is the most important facility for the care of weak children. The school must be equipped with a special sunbathing room. If it is a simple school or is limited by economy, at least a simple sunbathing area should be set up, such as on the roof playground, etc. A curtain is set up to prevent wind, white cloth is laid on the ground, and black cloth is prepared for parts of the body that need to avoid direct sunlight. Sunlight should not pass through glass, because glass can absorb the ultraviolet light in the sunlight and reduce the effectiveness of sunbathing. Therefore, it is best to choose a square that is directly exposed to the sun. The principles of sunbathing are: 1. Expose the body surface to direct light. 2. Fully utilize sunlight, without any invisible obstacles. 3. Proceed gradually, and do not irradiate the whole body at once.</p>
<p>(B) Irradiation of artificial sun lamps</p>
<p>The effect of sunbathing depends on the effectiveness of the ultraviolet light in the sunlight. However, sunbathing sometimes cannot be implemented due to weather and seasonal conditions. Then, the school authorities should be responsible for arranging for weak children to be sent to large hospitals with complete equipment every week to undergo irradiation by artificial sun lamps. Its effectiveness is the same as sunbathing. The implementation methods are generally the same.</p>
<p>(C) Taking cod liver oil and its preparations</p>
<p>The school must stipulate that cod liver oil or vitamin drops should be distributed to children with weak bodies every week. The doctor must prove it and receive it from the public, and teach the parents how to take it. This has a very effective effect on improving anemia, glandular disease, teeth and overall stunted development, and weak constitution. It is indeed a nutritious and tonic food that cannot be underestimated. However, the distribution procedures should not be troublesome to avoid children abandoning it. Therefore, it must be determined according to the local situation.</p>
<h3>DDT and Prisoner Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Hu Qipeng</p>
<p>The insecticidal efficacy of DDT has been widely publicized in writing and adopted by the public for the past two years, and it is already well known to everyone. Its efficacy is particularly remarkable for the eight types of insects that are closely harmful to the body: such as flies, mosquitoes, fleas, lice, and bed bugs. Therefore, it can prevent infectious diseases transmitted by these insects: such as cholera, malaria, typhoid fever, typhus, and relapsing fever. In other words, if DDT is used properly, humans can reduce the threat of many infectious diseases. At the same time, it also saves many prisoners who are imprisoned in prisons, who do not need to be sentenced to death under criminal law, and die unjustly from illness. This is what this article is about.</p>
<p>Prisoners were originally considered to be unworthy of mention by the general public, thinking that there is no need to talk about hygiene for prisoners, and even if they die in prison from illness, it is their own fault and not worth worrying about. It should be known that this is a wrong way of thinking for human beings, and a too cruel inferiority. Therefore, since the 19th century, criminal law has gradually changed from the death penalty and physical punishment to the freedom penalty. The idea is that if a person commits a crime, only his freedom should be deprived, and his life should not be harmed. Therefore, advanced countries attach importance to improving prison hygiene and improving the treatment of prisoners. Recently, the Soviet Union will announce the abolition of the death penalty, which is a further step.</p>

<h3>An Epic History of the 1911 Revolution in the Northwest</h3>
<p>— Zhang Liqing</p>
<p>A Prophecy Recorded Regarding the "Fire Station"</p>
<p>A prophesied saying became like a folk rhyme, Indeed, where the station was, the defense disappeared; The bells and drums spared from the chaos were millennia old, Their smeared remaining red compared to the "beautiful watchtower".</p>
<p>The bell and drum towers of Xi'an City, located in the center, are grand architectures, remnants of thousands of years ago. Before the Xinhai Revolution's rise of the restoration army, the police authorities established a "fire brigade". The brigade headquarters was located on the Drum Tower, hanging a sign that read: "Fire Station." Comrade Wu Mu joked to me and others: "If you read these five characters backwards, they become 'Where the station was, the defense disappeared.'" After the revolution, the Manchu garrison in Xi'an was eliminated without a trace, fitting the prophecy. Afterward, the residents all knew this and turned it into a folk rhyme. This is a fact that we witnessed. I don't know why there was a missing character for "brigade" at that time. If there had been the character for "brigade," the inverted reading would not have made sense. The tower has plaques that read "Land of Civil and Military Prosperity" and "Soaring to Heaven," with characters larger than ten feet. In the sixteenth year of the Republic, someone in power painted both the "Bell and Drum Towers" red. The former Ming Dynasty's "Prince of Qin's Palace City," formerly known as the "Imperial City," was also renamed the "Red City." Beware of creating causes!</p>
<p>Comrade Jing Meijiu of Shanxi also has a poem recording this matter, which reads: The ten-foot star conjured a folk rhyme, Before the Double Ninth Festival, the wind and rain surged (Shaanxi's uprising was on the first day of the ninth month); A casual reverse reading became a clever prophecy, Indeed, where the station was, the defense disappeared.</p>
<p>Original note: When Chang'an established the "Fire Station," Wu Mu said to me: It can be read backwards as "Where the station was, the defense disappeared," which was fulfilled during the restoration. Allied Restoration of the old mountains and rivers, ten thousand households in Chang'an</p>
<p>The Shaanxi Revolutionary Army Rose on the First Day of the Ninth Month of the Xinhai Year</p>
<p>Allied Restoration of the old mountains and rivers, ten thousand households in Chang'an all sang victory; After the secret meeting in front of Xingfu Temple, they went together, generous for a time!</p>
<p>Shaanxi raised the banner of righteousness on the first day of the ninth month of the Xinhai year, being the first to respond to the Wuchang Uprising. Shanxi was on the eighth day of the ninth month, and other provinces and cities were after Shanxi. Looking back on the past and remembering the present, deeply regretting and thinking painfully, how could it not be that the heads and hot blood of the martyrs were easy to come by?</p>
<p>The strength of Shaanxi's uprising was entirely in the hands of the comrades in the New Army. The strategies and doctrines were advocated by the comrades of our Tongmenghui, instilled over several years. The teacher of the comrades of the Shaanxi Tongmenghui was the late Master Zhu Fuguang, who instilled revolutionary ideas after the Gengzi Year (1900). The teacher lectured at the academy, repeatedly explaining the "Revolution" hexagram of the "Book of Changes," "Tang Wu Revolution," the "Revenge" and "Three Ages" theory of the "Gongyang Commentary," the "Great Harmony" chapter of the "Li Yun" in the "Dai Dai Li," and the "People are Supreme" section of Mencius, promoting revolution, opposing the Manchus, and fighting for civil rights. He can be called a pre-eminent enlightened person. Those who went to Japan to join the Chinese Tongmenghui and returned to Shaanxi to carry out the revolution were all students of the teacher. It is true to call the teacher the propagator of the seeds of the Northwest Revolution, a true historical fact.</p>
<p>The people of the Tongmenghui were all upright, frank, sincere, and pure, knowing only obligations. After the restoration, they returned to their fields, initially without any so-called "inducement" or "utilization." May later people learn from this!</p>
<p>The Qing Imperial Palace in Xi'an</p>
<p>After the Western travels and several relocations, the people of Qin still remember the faces of the two emperors; In the blink of an eye, ten years have changed, The revolutionary flowers are red on Longevity Mountain.</p>
<p>During the Boxer Rebellion in the Gengzi Year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, Empress Dowager Cixi and Emperor Dezong fled north in panic, and then went to Shanxi and Shaanxi, temporarily using the former Governor's Office as the imperial palace. The following year, the Xinchou Peace Treaty was concluded, and the imperial court returned to the capital. The imperial palace was closed and dared not be inhabited. When the Xinhai Revolution broke out, the munitions bureau in Dongmutou Market was first used as the headquarters of the commander-in-chief, and then it was moved to the imperial palace to work. The residents habitually called it the "North Courtyard" to distinguish it from the "South Courtyard" of the Governor's Office. From the Xinchou Year to the Xinhai Year, it was exactly ten years, and the transformation of the North Courtyard was like this, so it is specially recorded.</p>
<p>By chance, a pill of Tai Mo was selected for the school, and the capable ministers ultimately possessed talents; The old man of three dynasties inside the "Xinhua Gate," Qian Youcheng in the "Political Affairs Hall."</p>
<p>During the Xinhai Revolution, the Shaanxi Provincial Treasurer, Qian Nengxun, concurrently served as the Acting Governor. On the second day of the ninth month, the revolutionary army attacked the Governor's Office. Qian raised a pistol to commit suicide, but did not hit a vital spot. He was immediately escorted out of the country. When Yuan Shikai usurped power, he changed the State Council to the Political Affairs Hall, with Xu Shichang as the Secretary of State and Qian as the "Right Chancellor." In the seventh year of the Republic, Xu was supported by the Anfu clique to become president, and Xu appointed Qian as the Prime Minister, who can be called a veteran of three dynasties in the Xinhua Gate.</p>
<p>Mourning the Martyrs and Remembering the Comrades</p>
<p>We shared hardships in the Xinhai and Renzi years, How many of the ten people still survive today? I deeply regret the burden of the remaining life, The nine domains are cleared and the souls are summoned again.</p>
<p>The old grass is high and low on the graves, How many heroes have been heard of for several generations? Countless disasters in the past forty years, General Zhang is the Chang'an masterpiece.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiangchu, with the courtesy name Yin Feng, is a native of Chang'an and the leader of the Shaanxi Xinhai Restoration, graduated from the Cavalry Department of the Military Academy. He is still alive today. He lives in Juhuayuan, Xi'an. (The book has not yet been published, so no reprinting is allowed.)</p>
<h3>Sayings of Romain Rolland</h3>

<p>How many heads were sacrificed in the Xinhai Revolution? The answer is: "No one can count." The spirit of revolution lies in being able to sacrifice one's own head in order to preserve the heads of the entire nation. At the beginning of the Xinhai Revolution period, the vernacular translation novel "How Many Heads" author wrote: "It is said that there is a great country in Europe called Poland." The content records the tragic history of Poland's subjugation. At that time, the literary novels selected for translation were written in the vernacular style, which is truly an arch in revolutionary literature. The book also contains sayings such as "When the country is about to be subjugated, people are still eating and drinking, singing and playing. Sad, sad! All benevolent comrades in the world, weep together." The author is named "One of the Surviving People of the Subjugated Country," published by Jingjin Bookstore in the thirtieth year of Guangxu. Hu Mieming wrote a poem:</p>
<p>Calamity water floods the sky, and the land is barren; The old pine trees grow in the cold year, The blood and tears of the spirits in the spring stain the earth.</p>
<p>The drama of the copper horse Huang Chao is pitiable, Sad to sacrifice and call to heaven; Do not regard people lightly, Look closely at where the hibiscus is over there.</p>
<p>The long reign of five or six years came to an end, People's hearts are like water flowing east; The unfeeling azure sky is too vast, A red patch on the campfire city wall.</p>
<p>What is the matter for the living to fall into grief, The north and south of the mountains are all spring; Crying for parents in the morning and mourning for children in the evening, The night moon in the third watch is always startling.</p>
<p>The bloodline is now entrusted to ashes, Jackals, wolves, and tigers come together; From now on, there is no interest in life, The imprisoned survivors mourn in the night.</p>
<p>I am a madman, and my words are mad, But I use omens as human articles; A hundred years later, there will be onlookers, Please ask Ping Sha to mourn the wounded.</p>
<h3>Author's Quotes</h3>

<h3>The Story Told by the Eaves Rain</h3>
<p>— Qingguo</p>
<p>Eaves Rain</p>
<p>Are you moved by the story told by the eaves rain?</p>
<p>But I rudely want to kick the silence of the night with my feet.</p>
<p>In the distance, the gong rang again; it was simply like a standard, piercing the night's net, hitting the target, hitting right next to my ear. Then, a spark suddenly lit up, slowly floating from the end of the black wave, close to my window.</p>
<p>My window is having a cold dream.</p>
<p>In the distance, the stallholder is shouting again;</p>
<p>In the distance, the dog is barking;</p>
<p>In the distance, the voices are jumping and making noise. …</p>
<p>And my window is having a cold dream.</p>
<p>I turned off my light and stared at the window. I seem to have touched a secret of the window. Outside, the rain is getting lighter. But the tune of the eaves rain is even more mournful…</p>
<p>The eaves rain is singing softly;</p>
<p>Where there is song, there will be no loneliness; where there is light, there will be no darkness; where there are flowers, there will be no ugliness;</p>
<p>Lips</p>
<p>Child, your lips are a rose, red,</p>
<p>And mine are two haggard leaves drifting from a distant place. What could be more beautiful than a rose? Your lips are so rosy and tender; inside your lips, you even have a row of teeth that are white and soaked, and a tongue that is red and intoxicating. Child, please cherish your lips! For you, for more people.</p>
<p>Do you know that where there are lips, there is song; where there is song, there will be no loneliness.</p>
<p>Eyes</p>
<p>Do you like to look at other people's eyes?</p>
<p>And your tears are about to well up first.</p>
<p>Remember that familiarity will kill your youth, and passion will damage your reason.</p>
<p>I won't cry. My eyes are two dusty, broken lamps.</p>
<p>The dead ashes of the past buried in the broken lamp plate cannot be excavated by you.</p>
<p>Child, I bless you, your eyes are a lamp flashing with a blazing flame.</p>
<p>Having a lamp flashing with a blazing flame is the most happiness. It is possible to travel the night road.</p>
<p>Child, please cherish your eyes! For you; for more people. Isn't it true that our vast and gloomy land urgently needs lights to light up!</p>
<p>Youth</p>
<p>Do you love flowers? Do you love the flowers blooming on the green plains of spring?</p>
<p>I also love the sun.</p>
<p>Apart from the sun, there is no other flower that never withers.</p>
<p>Youth is the most precious flower.</p>
<p>But the life of youth is too short. Before the sun is red and mature, it falls into the soil like cold morning dew.</p>
<p>Flowers that fall into the soil have no possibility of resurrection.</p>
<p>And youth has no seeds.</p>
<p>Child, please cherish your youth! For you, for more people.</p>
<p>Tell you that this barren field should be decorated with some flowers.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts in a Shanghai Residence with Preface</h3>
<p>— Chen Shuren</p>
<p>I was unable to find a residence in the capital, so I stayed with my relative Xiao in Shanghai. Ten days have passed in an instant. I hastily composed this to record my movements.</p>
<p>I have been in Taiwan Province for more than twenty years, but I did not expect that it would not be easy to live in Chang'an; I laugh at myself for not having the three rabbit holes, but I can still live in a spacious house.</p>
<p>Don't talk about living a simple life, Where in the world can I not be accommodated! Why do I need to have thoughts of Guan, A recluse hidden in the bustling city.</p>
<p>Living in seclusion to preserve my true self, I avoid the soft red dust of this world, The beauty of Huan Lun reaches its peak here, I do not deserve the body of a wandering cloud and wild crane.</p>
<p>The wind does not admire the courage of King Chu, Happiness should be shared with the public; In the bamboo pavilion, under the gauze window, on the rattan table, This wind is not only my clear wind.</p>
<p>Autumn coolness is sent, and the rain has just stopped, Leaning on the railing, I am unable to be sad; Infinitely added to the meaning of good poems, The wind is far and the clouds are cold, about to turn to autumn. (One day before the Beginning of Autumn)</p>
<p>Autumn in Jiangnan is the most pleasant, I plan to arrange happy events frequently; I am happy that Yan Ying is close to the market, I can taste fresh water shield, wormwood, chrysanthemum, and crabs at will. (The Day of the Beginning of Autumn)</p>
<p>Faint sounds of nature are easily submerged, Who else will appreciate the sound? The charming daughter at this time truly understands things, I buy an autumn insect to accompany my clear singing.</p>
<p>I buy fruits and vegetables back from the market, I arrange them in a few piles on the table; Young daughters and grandchildren write and draw around, The artistic wind blows here.</p>

<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>This is indeed a solution, and undeniably that of a bright and upright hero. Regrettably, Yaoqun's current situation involves a unique difficulty. She and Little Tiger have another mission, and this mission is extremely important. This delay in Tianjin was accidental, merely intended to observe the local situation casually, without any specific task. Therefore, if she gets caught up in this whirlpool, even if she does well, officially, it would only be evaluated as "overstepping bounds and meddling." If she gets herself trapped, she would inevitably be accused of acting wilfully and treating public duties as child's play. Public duties have their defined paths and cannot involve overstepping authority; one cannot act on impulse like a knight-errant in a novel. At most, she can only submit a report of what she has personally seen, which is already considered meddling.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although Yaoqun learned a little about the other party's background from the innkeeper, it was, as the innkeeper said, "somewhat unclear." In other words, the other party remains hidden in the shadows, their true nature unknown, while she is completely exposed without any cover. Knowing oneself but not the enemy puts one at a disadvantage. If a conflict arises, defeat is almost certain, leaving only a slim chance of survival. However, Yaoqun absolutely cannot gamble on that slim chance.</p>
<p>"I am an honest man," the man said, observing that Yaoqun did not respond to his long speech and several questions, and remained very calm; only her finely drawn eyebrows creased slightly, indicating that she found his appearance, rhetoric, and questions novel and amusing; like a spectator appreciating a clown's signature performance on stage; or like unintentionally discovering a rare spectacle—a magpie with two heads—and showing no intention of interrupting, but rather listening attentively, willing to continue listening; so he added the self-promotion "honest man," but then felt that the statement was too weak, so he perked up again:</p>
<p>"Miss Ji, perhaps you think I'm being a bit presumptuous, and I certainly admit I am. But the opportunity is limited, and time does not permit. I can only be presumptuous. I'm truly sorry; a beautiful and graceful woman like Miss Ji certainly won't mind these minor matters… Moreover, the moment you two got off the train, I noticed you:"</p>
<p>Hearing this, Yaoqun suddenly took out a handkerchief, held it to her mouth and nose with both hands, turned away, and sneezed loudly, but immediately returned to her original state, listening quietly.</p>
<p>"...Of the one hundred fifty or sixty men, women, and children on the two passenger cars, only your two travel documents were issued by the Japanese military. At that time, I determined two possibilities: either you were young ladies or young masters from some big shot's family in 'Manchukuo'; or relatives of those newly rich officials from within the country. However, after carefully observing your actions, I immediately overturned both of these assumptions. Why? It's very simple: if you were either of those two types of people, you definitely wouldn't be without fanfare, putting on airs—bringing two maids or servants, getting a car to pick you up. Even if you got off the train halfway, being as young as you two are, wouldn't you be flustered and frantic, acting like spoiled children, putting on a big show, and immediately calling for a small chartered car to run straight to Beiping? Would you be so thrifty and composed?..."</p>

<h3>Revival of the National Soul – Written on the Double Tenth Festival in the 36th Year [of the Republic] –</h3>
<p>— Xiao Kangshi</p>
<p>At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Wu Sangui, for the sake of the courtesan Chen Yuanyuan, "cried until the six armies wore mourning, in a rage he charged for a beauty," and let the Qing troops into the Pass, allowing the foreign race to occupy our great land for three hundred years.</p>
<p>During the three hundred years of the Qing Dynasty, although many patriots plotted to restore the "Ming Dynasty," their hearts were not united, and repeated setbacks diminished their efforts. Until Premier Sun "advocated revolution," launching uprisings successively in Pingxiang and Liling, as well as Chaozhou and Huizhou. Advancing from Qinlian to seize Liangyue, they retreated to the Ten Thousand Great Mountains. He then conspired with Huang Xing and others to seize Zhennanguan, fighting for seven days and nights before retreating into Annam. Five years before the founding of the Republic, they again plotted at the Yunnan border, ordering Huang Mingguang to seize Hekou, but failed again due to lack of command. Two years before the Republic, Huang Xing, Hu Hanmin, and others again plotted to launch an uprising with the Guangzhou New Army, but failed again. The following year, on March 29th of the Xinhai year, Huang Xing gathered comrades in Guangzhou to launch an uprising, attacking the governor's office, which became known as the Huanghuagang Uprising. In total, uprisings were launched in various places, no less than dozens of times, lasting for over ten years, all of which failed, and the comrades who were killed by the Qing government included Qiu Jin, Tang Caichang, and the martyrs of Huanghuagang, whose names cannot be fully recorded in the history books.</p>
<p>In the Xinhai year, the Qing government nationalized the national railways, and the gentry and merchants of Sichuan requested the governor to retract the order, but to no avail, and they were arrested and shot by the government, arousing popular anger. The Qing government then sent high officials to Sichuan to investigate and brought the Hubei New Army with them. At that time, most of the New Army were revolutionaries, and when their conspiracy was exposed, dozens of them were killed. On October 10th, the engineering battalion in Wuchang took the lead in launching an uprising, occupying the arsenal. The baggage train outside the city also broke through the gates and entered, jointly attacking the governor's office, and the cavalry and artillery also joined in, unanimously electing the New Army brigade commander Li Yuanhong as the governor of the Hubei Army, and Tang Yuanlong as the civil administrator, calling themselves the "Military Government of the Republic of China."</p>
<p>Li immediately sent troops across the river to occupy Hankou and Hanyang, and the consular corps of various countries declared independence. The Qing government was shocked and reappointed Yuan Shikai as the governor of Huguang, who attacked Hankou and Hanyang, and bombarded Wuchang, and the situation became critical. Fortunately, Hunan had declared independence, and Huang Xing returned to the country, leading the militia of the two lakes in a fierce battle. The provinces responded successively, the navy also revolted against the Qing, and Shanghai and Nanjing were also recovered by the revolutionary army. The Qing government then sent envoys to negotiate peace in Shanghai, changing to a republican system. The Qing government relinquished power, and the revolutionary army overthrew the Qing government, finally achieving success.</p>
<p>In this simple record, we deeply know that after three hundred years under a foreign race, the "October 10th" uprising in the Xinhai year was able to "revive the national soul" entirely, which was certainly not accidental, but was achieved by shedding much "blood of martyrs"! Erecting a "cross" drenched in fresh blood with their heroic spirits!</p>
<p>However, after the founding of the Republic of China, Yuan's dictatorship led to the Second Revolution, followed by the Yunnan Uprising, the failure of Yuan's imperial system, and then the power struggle between the government and the parliament, Zhang Xun's restoration, and warlord separatism. Years of natural and man-made disasters plunged the "revived national soul" into a state of unconsciousness. This was thought to be a symptom of "congenital deficiency" and "acquired imbalance." It was not until the success of the Northern Expedition that the unconscious "national soul" was slightly revived.</p>
<p>However, having been severely ravaged by the warlords in the past few years, rebuilding was difficult, and the Japanese invaders took advantage of the opportunity to advance. The "September 18th Incident" shed blood in Pan Yang, the "January 28th Incident" was the Battle of Shanghai, and finally the "August 13th Incident." After the arduous "Eight-Year War of Resistance," many admirable and moving stories were created.</p>
<p>On this third "National Day Commemoration" since the victory, one cannot help but sigh at the battered and weakened "national soul."</p>
<h3>Revolutionary Grass</h3>
<p>— Yun Yao</p>
<p>Chatting with a wartime friend in the evening, we happened to talk about the "revolutionary grass" that was most annoying when working in the occupied areas in the past. Although time has passed and the bad impression it gave me has slowly faded with the passage of time, the mere mention of its name suddenly brings back many memories that seem to be right before my eyes.</p>
<p>"Revolutionary grass" seems to be nowhere to be seen in Shanghai, so I dare to believe that many people are unfamiliar with this old-fashioned name. Now let me give you a brief introduction!</p>
<p>The shape of "revolutionary grass" is very similar to withered grass, with leaves emerging from the end of the stem, slightly triangular in shape, light green in color, and floating on the surface of the water. From a distance, it is easily mistaken for water chestnut grass. Naturally, it also has roots, but they do not attach to the muddy bottom, so before it has become sufficiently prosperous and developed transverse strength, it is like duckweed, carried by the wind. However, its propagation is extremely fast. As long as there are no prolonged strong winds, even if it is only a few scattered plants at first, it can cover the entire river in a week or two. Moreover, it grows very tightly and closely attached to each other, which greatly hinders the passage of ships.</p>
<p>It is said that its seeds were brought from abroad by Empress Dowager Cixi, and its original name was not "revolution." It was because the Kuomintang later launched a revolution and overthrew the Qing Dynasty that it gradually became known as "revolutionary." Some people also speculate that it only existed when the National Revolutionary Army began the Northern Expedition because there was no such grass before, so no one knew its name. Therefore, they adapted to the trend of the times and called it "revolutionary grass." What exactly is it? That can only be determined by botanists, but adapting to the times, it doesn't seem too inappropriate to temporarily call it "revolutionary grass."</p>
<p>However, judging by its name, since it is called "revolutionary grass," then it should also, like the meaning of the word "revolution" that we humans use, have a mission to reform the old, innovate, and transform the environment in the realm of aquatic plants. However, in fact, the process and ultimate result it demonstrates do not match its name, because although other water surface obstacles are driven away or submerged by it wherever it goes, and the appearance of the scenery does indeed have a new look for a time, this is nothing more than a means for it to seize territory and develop its power. The life and convenience of other things are deprived and lost because of its dominance.</p>
<p>During the war, I worked in the occupied areas of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou. Because there were many rivers and streams there, almost all activities relied on boats on the waterways. Therefore, whenever enemy and puppet troops came out to sweep, we often suffered many false alarms of danger and crisis due to the entanglement and obstruction of "revolutionary grass" in the rivers and streams, so at that time, there was no comrade who did not hate it, and they all changed its name to "fatal grass" to express their hatred.</p>
<h3>Reflections on National Day</h3>
<p>— Chi Chao</p>
<p>The annual National Day celebration has arrived again. What a happy and joyful day!</p>
<p>Civil servants can rest and not work; teachers can stop lecturing; and ordinary students can freely and happily spend this anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>However, the enthusiasm for this commemoration is not as widespread as that for the Mid-Autumn Festival and the Double Ninth Festival. Because the peasants in the countryside only know that the eighth month and fifteenth day of the lunar calendar is the Mid-Autumn Festival, when mooncakes can be eaten, and the ninth day of the ninth month of the lunar calendar is the Double Ninth Festival, when Double Ninth cakes are so sweet and delicious, but they don't know anything about the National Day on October 10th. Perhaps this is because our country places too much emphasis on eating, and only when there is something to eat do people know that this day exists.</p>
<p>National Day originally has a long history of blood and tears. Speaking of this history, people are generally tired of listening. This is a story worth commemorating about our founding father, leading his comrades to overthrow the Manchu Qing Dynasty, overthrow autocracy, and establish the Republic of China, creating a bloody revolutionary history.</p>
<p>A most unusual news item was once published in the newspaper, saying: "The Japanese celebrate the anniversary of the Nagasaki atomic bombing." Most people thought it was a ridiculous thing, but I think otherwise. I am not endorsing the actions of the Japanese invaders, but in reality, today's National Day is more like a day of national humiliation, because the blood of the martyrs has faded; the hot blood has cooled; we, the later generations of revolutionaries, are ashamed of the trust placed in us by our predecessors, and we have not yet been able to support the nation-state into a normal state. This is something we should be ashamed of.</p>
<p>The people have high expectations for the government, and this requires us to strive to reform and renew ourselves.</p>
<h3>On the Veto Power</h3>
<p>— Pu Lun</p>
<p>The issue of the veto power will be the focus of debate at this United Nations General Assembly, and it is also the key to the success or failure of the General Assembly, and even a difficult problem related to world safety. Because if the veto power is revised or abolished, the Soviet Union and other countries under its influence may angrily withdraw from the United Nations, and the world will once again fall into a state of war.</p>
<p>Since the day the United Nations was founded, for more than two years, it has been plagued by a constitutional issue—the veto power. Now let us talk about it roughly so that readers know what the veto power is.</p>
<p>In the United Nations General Assembly, countries are equal regardless of size, and each person has one vote. Everything is passed with a two-thirds majority vote. Outside the General Assembly, there are also several councils and an International Court of Justice. Among the councils, there is one called the Security Council, which does not manage culture and education, nor does it interfere with economic planning. What it manages is world peace, that is, deciding which country is right and which country is wrong in international disputes, and how to punish or even subdue them. The nature and power of this council actually exceeds the entire United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>At the San Francisco Conference, there was a distinction between the so-called inviting countries (China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union) and the invited countries. This means that at the beginning of the organization, there was a distinction between hosts and guests. In the General Assembly, the treatment of hosts and guests is the same. Among the eleven members of the Security Council, five are "hosts," the so-called permanent members, and the other six members are "guests," who are elected every two years. Article 27 stipulates the difference in voting effectiveness between hosts and guests. "Decisions on procedural matters shall be made by an affirmative vote of seven members. Decisions on all other matters shall be made by an affirmative vote of seven members, which includes the concurring votes of the permanent members." This means that except for the procedural issues of the Security Council itself, all cases handled must be agreed upon by the five hosts; otherwise, they will not take effect. This is the so-called "veto power." However, there is also a restriction on the "veto power" in the Charter; it divides international events into two types: "situations" and "disputes." For the latter, the country concerned has no right to vote. The people who drafted the Charter inserted this clause, both to give small countries spiritual comfort and to leave a clever plan for the big countries to escape, and at the same time, to provide good topics for sophistical diplomats. The painstaking effort is extreme.</p>
<p>The veto power was originally a special privilege granted to the five powers by the United Nations Charter. Although the reason at the time was to respect the contributions of the five powers in defeating the Axis countries; the main purpose was to maintain the coordination of the five major powers in the joint organization. All resolutions should not fall into unexecutable because any one of the powerful countries is dissatisfied, resulting in the crisis of the United Nations split; although this method is inevitably accommodating to reality, in the current international situation, it must be said that it has its sufficient and necessary reasons. However, because the Soviet Union has abused this power for more than two years (using the veto power as many as eighteen times), it has led to a situation where it is difficult to reach an agreement on everything.</p>

<h3>An Image of a Prominent Woman in Europe: The Queen of Greece</h3>
<p>— Jin Sheng</p>
<p>Portrait of Queen of Greece and King Paul of Greece</p>
<p>Greece is currently one of the most unstable countries in Europe, with internal and external troubles and frequent persecutions. The destructive activities of the Communist Party in the north have never stopped. Covertly adding the infighting of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in the Mediterranean and the Near East, the situation has become increasingly complex.</p>
<p>The Greek royal family lives in this precarious state. The new monarch Paul took the throne not long ago, and all parties do not know him deeply enough, but many people know that his queen is indeed a very outstanding person. People say that Eva Perón has a great influence on the President of Argentina, and some even say that she is the behind-the-scenes manipulator of politics. In fact, the influence of the Queen on King Paul of Greece is similar.</p>
<p>Here, we introduce the queen's origins, demeanor, views, and personality to readers.</p>
<p>The Queen of Greece is the granddaughter of former German Emperor Wilhelm II. She is beautiful and intelligent, with a strong personality and full of courage. She is just over thirty years old, and her social skills are superior. In this troubled country, she has won many friends.</p>
<p>But she is not a person who can sit back and relax. She is diligent in her work and responsible in her duties. Since Greece was liberated from the Nazis, she has returned to her motherland and immediately participated in various relief efforts. She went to remote villages to visit poor people, and it can be said that she went to great lengths. No matter how poor and harsh the surrounding environment was, she was able to deal with it calmly as a queen. She often said with a smile: "I am happy to advise on everything."</p>
<p>What the Queen pays most attention to is work. She has organized many voluntary work service groups, and her enthusiasm has deeply moved King Paul. Once, he said to a group of college students, I am willing to hold a hoe and work with you to repair roads. The college students responded with enthusiastic cheers, claiming that they were willing to sacrifice their lives for Greece. The King did not agree with this statement, but encouraged them in a gentle tone: "This is not enough, you must work for Greece." From this sentence, we can see how deeply the King was influenced by the Queen.</p>
<p>The Queen once loudly appealed: "What Greece needs today is work, organizing voluntary work service groups and organizing more voluntary work service groups. The Queen believes that only work can make guerrillas run out of the mountains and become good citizens of the country. She hopes that the government army will win, but once victory is achieved, she advocates treating the "rebellious" people with a tolerant attitude. She said:</p>
<p>"We can save them; they are just a group of young people without work and leadership. Some of their leaders are certainly bad, but most people are not." From her political views, we can see the breadth of her vision.</p>
<p>The Queen's moving personality sometimes makes enemies her prisoners. Once, she went to visit a hospital, and there were many wounded rebel soldiers being treated there. She stood tall, and with a dignified manner, she ran in and stood in the middle of them, directly asking: "Are you Greeks?" The wounded soldiers said in unison: "Yes." So she continued: "Always remember this sentence, never, ever forget that you are Greeks."</p>
<p>Although the Queen was born in Germany, she deeply loves the natural scenery of Greece, and even believes that the magnificent mountains and forests of Greece are more beautiful and moving than the Swiss Alps. Her love for Greece has won the favor of most Greek people. Her enemies say that her beautiful and moving personality is a danger. In the face of her smile, even enemies will melt like white tower oil.</p>
<p>The current Queen of Greece is such an outstanding person. The strong personality of the Teutonic nation and the political compromise make her increasingly declining in the imperial system. A noteworthy queen.</p>
<h3>Shrimp and Crabs</h3>
<p>— Xiao Kangshi</p>
<p>Shrimp and crabs fill the small vegetable market; shrimp are soldiers and crabs are generals; Frost's Descent has not yet arrived and there are so many; no wonder the world is chaotic and you see adulteration and theft! It is commonly said that seeing many shrimp and crabs portends war; this year Frost's Descent has not yet arrived, but crabs are already on the market and plentiful; how can there not be smoke of war everywhere?</p>

<h3>Shen Bao Relief Hospital Co-Organizes the Ninth Session of Trachoma Prevention and Treatment, Celebrating the 75th Anniversary of the Shen Bao's Founding. Quota of 750, Applications Begin on Double Tenth Festival.</h3>
<p>The "Trachoma Prevention and Treatment" campaign jointly organized by this newspaper and the Relief Hospital has been going on for more than a year since it started last August. During this period, we have successively held eight sessions of trachoma prevention and treatment, and about 1,500 people have applied for examination and treatment, including teachers, students, workers, business and industrial staff, and civil servants, covering all classes.</p>
<p>We dare not place too high an evaluation on this campaign, nor dare we give it too urgent a hope. Our purpose is only to arouse the attention of Chinese people to the disease of trachoma, and not let it gradually spread unconsciously and become a major disaster for national health.</p>
<p>Trachoma is not as terrible as tuberculosis, nor can it kill people in a short time like cholera and diphtheria. Because of this, people lightly ignore it, so countless people are infected with trachoma, and gradually, it has become a "common disease" of Chinese people. In the past year, we have tried to treat people who have been infected with trachoma, and at the same time helped people who have not suffered from trachoma to prevent the invasion of trachoma. More than 1,000 people have actually cured their trachoma.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from the Relief Hospital, agreeing to continue to handle the ninth session of trachoma prevention and treatment with this newspaper, and the quota has been expanded to 750 people to celebrate the 75th anniversary of this newspaper's great commemoration.</p>
<p>For technical reasons, the 750 places will be handled in six months, in other words, each month we can provide free examination and treatment for 125 readers.</p>
<p>Applications will begin on the Double Tenth Festival, with no limit to gender, age, or qualifications. Every reader has the opportunity to be examined and treated for trachoma.</p>
<p>When applying, please prepare an application form, stating your name, gender, age, and occupation, and attach a stamped return envelope with your address clearly written on it for sending the examination certificate. Finally, we must solemnly state that we will not issue examination certificates to applicants who do not meet all the procedures, so that applicants who have completed the procedures can have more opportunities for prevention and treatment.</p>

<h3>Six Chapters of National Day Qitianle (with Preface)</h3>
<p>— Ju Zheng</p>
<p>Like a dragon soaring in China, it was almost in the Dinghai year. The lunar month is mid-autumn, and the festival is the Double Tenth. The sound of drums and dances rises, and the whole country is ecstatic. Alas, how grand! Counting our history and tracing the source, the Father of the Nation served as the founding president, submitting a proposal to the National Assembly to designate the day of the Wuchang Uprising, August 19th, as National Day. Proclaiming it both at home and abroad, it shook both ancient and modern times. Thirty-six years have passed, and there has never been enough time, and a special National Day music movement has not yet been prepared. The sounds of Shaowu are not heard, and the laws of Gongshang are disordered. I do not presume to be worthy, so I have taken the old tune of Qitianle, added lyrics to it, and tentatively named it National Day Qitianle. The music score says: Qitianle is a slow sound and belongs to the Huangzhong Palace. Whether or not my clumsy work conforms to the laws of rhythm is known to musicians; I am not familiar with it. Furthermore, the first uprising took place in the city of Wuchang, and the strategic location within the city was fiercely contested for military use. The places where people gathered and resided before the uprising, such as Tanhualin, Yellow Crane Tower, Baobingtang, Huangtupo, Yanzhishan, and Chu Wangtai, are used as themes according to their locations and events, forming six chapters in total, briefly outlining the general ideas, to inspire poetic reflection.</p>
<p>Tanhualin</p>
<p>The Rizhihui, which rose after the Science Tutoring Institute, secretly formed a society in the Anglican Church of Tanhualin. It was influential and honorable, self-sacrificing, and with pure aspirations, making it the most moving story of the seeds of revolution. Therefore, Tanhualin comes first, and all previous planning groups belong to it.</p>
<p>What is the matter with Nan Gong uttering the name of the state of Chu? The prophetic words are left behind in the book. Jie was exiled to Nanchao, and Zhou burned Chaoyi, the wicked taking what they wanted. Blood flowed on the grinding pestle. We pledge to remember the state of Ju, holding high the aspirations of Zhang Chu. The stallion gleams, meeting Yuan Xiangshi in the vastness. The God is about to descend upon Ru. For whom is the Science Tutoring Institute, with a separate unique purpose? Secretly discussing the classics in the pavilion, and performing the history of Tianqu, awakening the enlightened minds. The secret is attached to the red book. Alas, the ploughing ceased in Longshang, and the soldiers were in the army. Joining the League, class by class, can be counted.</p>
<p>Yellow Crane Tower</p>
<p>Jiang Yiwu, Liu Yao, Wang Xianzhang, Wang Shouyu, and others, inspired by Liu Jing'an, Hu Ying, who were in prison, and Zhan Dabei of the Dajiang Bao, invited comrades to join the army and convened a general meeting at the Yellow Crane Tower on New Year's Day of the Xinhai year. In the midst of the drinking and excitement, they pointed to the couplet on the pillars of the Aolue Tower, saying, "The wise men of the past reorganized the universe, and their achievements all started from the Jianghan region." Isn't this Zhang Wenxiang implying that the first uprising by us must be in Wuchang? Therefore, the Yellow Crane Tower comes second, and the Qunzhishe and the Zhenwushe all belong to it.</p>
<p>Wenxiang ascended the Yellow Crane Tower with excitement. His words are pregnant with meaning. Reorganizing the universe, facilitating cultural exchange, all these were the work of our ancestors. The spirit of Jianghan shines brightly, and the snake lurks in the shadows. Vividly, on sunny Qingchuan, comrades enjoy their studies. Zhenwu has never shown weakness. For the coordination of the Qunzhi, there is the same connection. The footprints are like mud, and the chicken feathers are stained with blood, facing this New Year's Day. Sworn promises are repeated. Laughing at the governor holding a skirt, and the superiors entangled. Hats with red flowers are all disgusting.</p>
<p>Baobingtang</p>
<p>When Wenxiang was the governor of Hubei, he selected a beautiful place in the Shueshan Mountain and built a hall, naming it Baobingtang, to escape the summer heat and gather for banquets during his spare time. The local people were also allowed to rest there, creating an elegant cultural atmosphere. At that time, comrades in the camp often gathered here during holidays to discuss the progress of the camp activities, which is worthy of being recorded. Therefore, Baobingtang comes third, and all the representatives of the garrison camps belong to it.</p>
<p>Pei Gong expresses his feelings. Leisurely, he seeks like-minded friends. The dog-butchering from Huai Xu, the snake-charming from Mangdang, those who want to hear Ming Jiao. Calling out, one after the other. Thinking of the revival of the Han people, the overthrow of Qin is necessary. Respectfully, the soldiers are deployed, walking on frost, we shiver from solid ice. The supervisors come to inquire frequently. Do not worry about being discovered, seek shelter in the hall. Documents fly in the army tents, and announcements are made at the gates, with each representative from the camp. Timely promotion. Fearing rumors, and doves and crows on branches. Leaking the spring light, upsetting the superiors.</p>
<p>Huangtupo</p>
<p>Earlier, the Gongjinhui was first formed in Edo, Japan, and I once served as its leader. When I went south, Yang Shijie and Liu Gongsun Wu successively managed affairs. In the Xinhai year, I returned to Wuchang, and Sun found a residence in Huangtupo, assumed the position of Zhang Gongjinhui, and reopened a restaurant with Deng Yulin. Amidst the clutter of cups and plates, the heroic emotions were unconsciously stirred. Therefore, Huangtupo comes fourth, and the engineering, baggage, left and right flags all belong to it. Although the Ming scholars have no peaceful land. The customs of the nation still exist. The three massacres of Jiading and the ten days of Yangzhou await the reading of Mingyi. The sound is like mourning. Furthermore, the history of the mind is passed down like a lamp, and the Green Forest and Water Margin. Various rules and regulations reveal everything about Zhang's ethnicity. Gongjin seeks common salvation. There should be no ambiguity, each is called a shield. Zhu Gui delivers meals, and Hong Niang sends letters, don't say that Sui He has no martial skill. King Wen is angry. Let the forbidden garden play the diao, and the city is full of wind and rain. Grit your teeth, not revealing a trace.</p>
<p>Yanzhishan</p>
<p>Located to the left of the mountain's rear Pacification Office, the Gongjinhui also set up an office here, specifically for contacting students and new recruits. The Mianyang Supervisor of Studies serves as the outer perimeter, making it the most historically interesting among the secret uprisings. Therefore, Yanzhishan comes fifth, and the Lianghu Physical Chemistry and Surveying Special Schools all belong to it.</p>
<p>He Lang suddenly threads the needle. Babbling, starting a new chapter. Rouge from the North, and gold dust from the Southern Dynasties, don't say that this person is not seen. The regret of the common people. It is a young woman knowing sorrow, lingering in the courtyard. The car insects leap, and the sound of autumn often moves with deep resentment. Lianghu has added new relatives. They come in turn, with swords around their waists. Jia's family peeks at the curtain, and the goddess Mi leaves her pillow, with another infatuated sentiment. Burying yourself in the desk. Laughing at the graffiti of the museum, and the love of the swallows in the forest. Taking advantage of going to Liangshan, we are all happy to start.</p>
<p>Chu Wangtai</p>
<p>Located between Tongxiang Gate and Zhonghe Gate, there is an armory. The weapons and ammunition stored there are numerous, and there are often heavy troops stationed there. Until August 18th, the underground organizations in the city were uncovered, and the three martyrs, Peng Chu, Luo Liuyao Cheng, and Yang Hongsheng, were killed. The news was alarming, and everyone was indignant. On the 19th night, impatiently, the fire started at Tangjiao? The engineering began to launch, and comrades from various camps and schools moved out upon hearing the sound, seizing Chu Wangtai in one fell swoop. This action was crucial to the success of the uprising. Therefore, Chu Wangtai comes last, and the South Lake Zhonghe Gate all belong to it.</p>
<p>Peng Gong wrote a confession the other day. The hidden worries of the country are vast. Dongyue Marsh Wu, Nanyang Baluo, all bravely went forward. The soldiers believe in rewards. Now, the young man takes up the knife, and starts to punish the fools. The gentle valley wind blows, and the night orchids do not allow looking back. The fire network of Tangjiao spreads. Towards the predetermined goal, attack the arsenal. The baggage is raised, and the engineering releases arrows, another echo is left. The siege is in the palm of your hand. Happy Wu Sheng won the door, the dragon and elephant of South Lake. Charging into Zhonghe, they rush up with a roar.</p>
<h3>Father of the Nation's Order to Rectify the Officials</h3>
<p>After the success of the revolution, Mr. Sun Yat-sen assumed the position of Provisional President and issued an order to rectify the officials in order to eliminate those who sought advancement through flattery. This order was published in this newspaper at the time. The original text reads:</p>
<p>"At the end of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, the officialdom was extremely corrupt. Relatives of the imperial family used profits and emoluments to entice those above, and the scholar-officials used profits and emoluments to trade below. Running around and scheming became the norm, and shamelessness prevailed. As a result, virtuous people were in the wilderness, doing good for themselves, not participating in government affairs, and the people lived in misery. Persisting in their ways without repentance led to their destruction. The Republic of China was established, and everything was renewed. The old city societies were swept away. Rectifying history and governance is a matter that cannot be delayed. However, with laws not yet promulgated and examinations not yet conducted, those seeking advancement harbor intentions of opportunistic theft, and those employing people have the convenience of choosing based on personal preference. If one is not careful, the abuses will be even worse than those of the Manchu Qing Dynasty. The distinction between order and chaos lies in this. Thinking of the future, how can one not be vigilant? At the beginning of the Nanjing government, there were often many people who ran around seeking connections in various places, seeking a position. With this mentality of seeking gain, the habit of deception and falsehood was opened. Some were old officials who pretended to be new talents, or who had just entered school and immediately claimed to have graduated, deceiving and misleading, considering it a skill to get away with it. Although the unified government has been established, and the official offices in this area have been immediately abolished, if unscrupulous people use this as a means of advancement, the lingering harm will be countless. For this reason, I order the ministers and vice ministers of the departments to always carefully investigate and carefully select people when employing them, so that mediocre talents are not allowed to muddle through, and the virtuous and capable are not driven away. This is of utmost importance. Furthermore, it has been found that some recommended officials in various departments hold two positions at the same time, which is not a careful approach to official duties. Those who recommend without knowing are negligent, and those who accept without being forthright are greedy for profit, both are shameless. In the future, except for special circumstances, no one shall hold multiple positions, in order to purify the officialdom and prevent maladministration. This is the order!"</p>
<p>This order from the Father of the Nation fully reveals the abuses of the official arena. Even today, it is still worthy of our vigilance and deep reflection.</p>
<h3>Chongqing and Shanghai: Two Places of Jubilation—Record of the First National Day After Victory</h3>
<p>It's the Double Tenth Festival again, the third National Day after the victory.</p>
<p>The nationwide frenzy of celebration two years ago seems to be right before our eyes. In these two years, the domestic political situation and the international situation have undergone great changes. Today, facing the war-torn country and the displaced refugees, we recall the scene two years ago, when we had just won, waving flags and shouting "Celebrate National Day, celebrate victory," we cannot help but feel a myriad of emotions.</p>
<p>However, the more it is like this, the more we miss this day two years ago, the first National Day after the victory, that kind of enthusiastic and crazy situation.</p>
<p>1945 (what an exciting year!) Japan surrendered! A series of victory cries, from August 13th to the Double Tenth Festival, made the people of the whole country hoarse. The Chinese people, who had become accustomed to the Double Tenth Festival during the national crisis, cheered and were encouraged for the motherland's return to light! "The enemy's planes bombed our homes, but they can't destroy our National Day!"</p>
<p>Here, we will first describe Chongqing—representing the various cities, large and small, and villages and towns in the rear; then we will describe Shanghai—representing the occupied areas that had fallen into the hands of the enemy.</p>
<p>In Chongqing</p>
<p>October 10, 1945, in Chongqing.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the streets were crowded with people. The ferries added extra shifts that day, and the cabins repeatedly spat out passengers entering the city from the South Bank, Jiangbei, Huangjueya, and Haitangxi. The sound of the horns was particularly frequent. The docks of Chaotianmen, Wanglongmen, and Chuqimen were doubly busy. The only street, Minzu Road, was packed with people. The buses, decorated with ribbons, were still squeezing through the crowd. The shop assistants, in groups of three or five, beat drums and walked around the streets. Linsen Road, Zhongshan Road—a scene of rising prosperity, full of infinite vitality.</p>
<p>Wu Guozhen, the Minister of the Central Propaganda Department (now our mayor), gave a speech at the National Day rally held at the Youth Hall in the wartime capital: "China after victory is about to engage in national construction. The citizens of Chongqing should be a model for the people of the whole country. The Party, government, military, and people should unite and work together to carry out national construction. Every citizen, as long as they have confidence in the government and enable the government to fully exert its strength, the prospects for national construction are absolutely optimistic!"</p>
<p>The Youth Corps and the Boy Scouts held an autumn grand review at the Xinyun Square of Fuzi Pond; the US Information Service held a victory photo exhibition at the "Spiritual Fortress"; the students of the drama school rode on parade trains and performed on the streets; three small teams of Kuomintang fighter jets, surrounded by six huge bombers, swept over the city sky, and a stack of colored leaflets flew out of the sky...</p>
<p>The cinemas hung up "Sold Out" signs at eight o'clock in the morning, and the Sichuan opera theater, which was usually deserted, also received special attention. Many places that people were usually tired of visiting suddenly became lovely again, and even the "pickled mustard tuber stir-fried shredded pork" that people were tired of eating tasted unusually delicious. Because the people who had come to the rear from far away from their hometowns had won, returned to their original positions, and would soon be able to go home. Facing this mountain city that was about to be said goodbye to, they could not help but feel reluctant to part.</p>
<p>The newspapers of the mountain city changed from yellow to pink, and special editions were added. They flew out of the hands of the newspaper vendors, flying all over the streets, flying all over the sky... The shops were doing good business; the leaders and famous generals, nine sheets per set, "Celebrate National Day, reduced price sale: President Chiang, Truman, Stalin, Attlee, Roosevelt, Xizhi VI, De Gaulle, Chen Cheng, Eisenhower..." There were countless young men and women who, on this day, completed their "War of Resistance marriages"!</p>
<p>The crowded crowds gathered on the streets until dusk, and the darkness of the night could not cover the excitement in people's hearts. Everywhere there were bright lights, and the V-shaped neon lights evoked a burst of hearty laughter in people's hearts, laughing!</p>
<p>In Shanghai</p>
<p>Laughing, the laughing in the hearts of the people in the recovered areas had a more pleasant and exciting emotion. October 10th in Shanghai was crazy Shanghai.</p>
<p>The racecourse—which once represented the history of imperialist aggression in Shanghai, and had also been used by the enemy puppets to celebrate the construction of the Greater East Asia—was used for the first time by the citizens of Shanghai to celebrate their own country's program. The National Day Commemoration and Victory Celebration Conference was held in the cheers of tens of thousands of people. These participants, starting at 5:00 in the morning, brought bread and dry food and waited in front of the racecourse gate. Before 8:00, the huge racecourse was crowded without any gaps.</p>
<p>The sound of firecrackers was rising and falling before dawn, awakening the citizens of Shanghai from their sleep. After 8:00, tens of thousands of citizens were all out on the streets, standing on the sides of the streets through which the parade passed. Nanjing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Lingfei Road, and Albert Road were crowded with people and filled with thunderous cheers. At 9:00 AM, a cannon fired one hundred and one times. The whistles of factories, ships, schools, and temples throughout the city sounded together, and at the same time, the sound of firecrackers was even more incessant. "Shanghai is already a proud Shanghai!"</p>
<p>As Mayor Qian Dajun said in his speech at the celebration meeting! "Now the sun and moon are shining again, the rivers and mountains have been recovered, and the compatriots from all walks of life have escaped the oppression of the enemy puppets and are once again under the protection of the country. The pent-up anger that has been accumulated in the past eight years can be vented as much as possible, and the patriotic feelings that have been hidden in the past eight years can be fully expressed. The joy and delight in our hearts cannot be described in words. Especially today, when we come to this great festival and participate in this grand event, seeing the national flag flying everywhere and hearing the national anthem being sung everywhere, thinking of all the past humiliations that have been swept away and all the shackles that have been abandoned, what we breathe now is completely the air of glory and freedom. We must be joyful and excited, as if drunk and crazy. This kind of mood can be said to be unprecedented in our lives and will never be forgotten!"</p>
<p>After the Youth Corps and the Boy Scouts were reviewed, the victory parade began. More than 500 participating groups, including the National Army, Allied forces, students, civil servants, workers from all walks of life, businessmen, and various organizations, totaling more than 200,000 people, set off from the racecourse amidst the constant playing of marches by more than 30 bands. The Kuomintang flags and the United Nations flags fluttered in the wind, and the various celebration arches along the way were even more magnificent in the midst of the parade of millions of people.</p>
<p>All the major theaters in the city offered half-price tickets to the audience, and it goes without saying that they were crowded. At 11:00 AM, Mayor Qian hosted a banquet at the Municipal Government to entertain distinguished guests from all walks of life at home and abroad. At 4:00 PM, the Third War Area Headquarters held a banquet at the Cathay Hotel to entertain Chinese and foreign guests and air force units. In the evening, the lights of various agencies, shops, and celebration arches shone brightly, dazzling. The citizens were crowded, and the roads were blocked.</p>
<p>The celebration program lasted for three days, and the grand occasion was unprecedented. This was Shanghai's first enthusiastic, exciting National Day that every citizen will always remember in the history of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Everyone remembers this situation, so there is no need to say more. But the Double Tenth Festival of 1947 has come again, which makes us feel a myriad of emotions. Today, in the face of such a situation, we must find ways to stabilize and unify the country as soon as possible, so that the people can live and work in peace, and then we can celebrate our Double Tenth National Day with great joy. This time will not be far away—perhaps next year.</p>
<h3>The Song Dynasty Also Had a Double Tenth Festival</h3>
<p>The name "Double Tenth Festival" was first created by Wu Zhilao, and the article "Historical Tales of the Double Tenth" in last year's National Day special issue of this newspaper once recorded this event. However, according to Chinese history, the name "Double Tenth Festival" already existed as early as the Song Dynasty. Because Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty was born on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, after he ascended the throne, due to the customary taboos of the Dragon Boat Festival, which was a ghost festival, he changed it to October 10th. Wu Zhengchuan, a monk of the Yuan Dynasty, recorded a poem titled "Double Tenth Festival" by the Song Dynasty poet Teng Xiuying in his "Xianglu". The poem says: "The festival meets the Double Tenth, celebrating the tranquility of the heavens, burning incense in the ancient temple to wish the emperor a long life; the ears are in the northern Jin Buddha temple, the eyes are on the southern pole, the star of the old man; thousands of officials are covered with flowers, always in a dark banquet, ten thousand miles of clouds are far away, blocking the court; pine and cypress fill the mountain, I plan for myself, the small minister is also green and green."</p>
<h3>The First Page of the Founding History: A Proclamation of the Wuchang Uprising</h3>
<p>After the Revolutionary Army occupied Wuchang, they convened and publicly elected Li Yuanhong as the governor, issued announcements to reassure the people, and sent proclamations throughout the country. The proclamation reads as follows: "On this certain day of a certain month in the 4609th year of the founding of China, the Military Government of the Republic of China proclaims: In the Spring and Autumn period, there was the revenge of nine generations, and in the Minor Odes, there was the righteousness of protecting the state. How much more so when the divine land of China is crawling under the feet of barbarians, and when thieves and monks usurp the master's position, with atrocities pressing from all sides, this is truly an intolerable situation. We descendants of the Yellow Emperor's lineage have enjoyed lasting prosperity for generations, and the virtues and achievements of our ancestors have illuminated the four corners of the world. When the Ming Dynasty encountered misfortune, the Eastern Hu barbarians were not taken seriously. Consequently, they seized our divine artifact and enslaved our Han people for over two hundred and sixty years due to Li Zicheng's rebellion. Wickedness continued, and generations were tyrannical. The imperial court became a place of fleeing swine and deer, and the wilderness echoed with the sighs of jackals and wolves. The barbarians rejoiced, lacking foresight, and taught theft while feigning ignorance, thus opening the door to admit the thieves, and ceding the land of our nation to prolong their fleeting lives. They have borrowed for too long without returning, and compounded their offenses by abandoning principles. This is not only a capital crime of the distant Hu barbarians but also a singular humiliation for the Han people. The Military Government, upholding this great righteousness and surveying our mountains and rivers, is feeding the horses and sharpening the weapons, constantly thinking of expulsion. However, because the overall situation was not yet ripe, we have endured humiliation until now. We have also repeatedly dispatched flanking forces and selected righteous warriors, who have bravely fought to revive the spirit of the Han people. This is why our chivalrous heroes have been repressed for so long. Heaven has deprived them of their spirits, and the hen has lost the morning. The foolish Hu barbarians have dared to assume the throne, causing petty people to advance together, disrupting the court and the countryside, hoarding gold and jade, and treating office as a marketplace. Powerful enemies see this and develop intentions, and the common people look upon it with distress. The barbarians, with their dog-like nature of breaking promises, have again engaged in the deceitful railway nationalization. They are losing power, harming the country, and robbing the people, and the resentment and anger have turned into thunder. From Hubei to Hunan, to Guangdong, to Sichuan, a great wind has risen, sweeping everything away. The collapse is inevitable, and the overflowing flood is imminent. This is truly the time for the Hu barbarians to receive their judgment and for the Han people to revive. The Military Government, overseeing all affairs and respectfully carrying out heavenly punishment, fears that the direction of the army may not be fully understood, causing those who are doubtful and fearful to be universally bewildered, and those in remote areas not to rise up. Therefore, we first announce the benefits of independence to our countrymen, saying: In the past, when the barbarian fortunes were flourishing, it was because they were born wild, skilled at archery and fighting, with fierce eyes and sharp tongues, behaving like jackals and wolves. Therefore, the fierce reputation of the Solun people spread far and wide. When they entered the pass, they promoted their strongmen and occupied key positions everywhere, forcing our people to transport grain and gold, and using these vile creatures to control our Chinese people. After nine generations, they became increasingly licentious and extravagant, relying on cunning and deceit to seize high positions. The court is filled with lifeless bodies, and people have become walking corpses. Therefore, the "Taiping" rebellion contributed to the success of Han traitors. In the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, the ancestral temples shook. Recently, the situation has become even more precarious. Our ancestral lands have been carved away to the north by Russia and seized to the south by Japan. The imperial court is desolate, and the ministers are carefree. Near relatives are skilled at trading, and high officials grow by selling the country. The roots have been severed, and the branches are in chaos. They are like a horse covered in tiger skin, only having an outward appearance. A kick will bring it down like rotten wood. This is the first reason why the barbarians are bound to fail. In the past, Wu Sangui opened the gates, leading to the fall of the Han dynasty. Fu Quan consolidated the dynasty by relying on Han traitors as assistants. After adopting some Han customs, they engaged in superficial appeasement. At that time, the great trend of the Chinese nation had passed, and righteous men hid in seclusion. Weak and incompetent scholars could not hold their own. They were forced to submit and serve the enemy, gradually becoming tainted with the barbarian ways and forgetting the great righteousness, mingling with the foul and taking the wrong as the right. Petty and greedy men occasionally showed small loyalties, allowing the barbarians to sit high and proudly suck the people's fat for two hundred years. The Han righteous armies repeatedly failed. Even Hong Xiuquan nearly restored the Han land, but Zeng Guofan, Hu Linyi, and Zuo Zongtang, as Han officials, acted perversely and against the tide, allowing the barbarians to be safe again after danger and remain for a long time. This is truly the drunkenness of 'filial grandsons', not the lasting strength of the rebellious barbarians. Now, the great righteousness is becoming clearer every day, and the people yearn for the Han. Eminent scholars and heroic men all revere heaven and love their ancestors, upholding their integrity. Although there are officials who have been tainted by false appointments and have been corrupted by officialdom, they all eagerly seek wealth and profit, are base, arrogant, and vain, and cannot be entrusted with difficult tasks. The barbarians are truly incompetent, and the Han officials are exhausted. Blind men ride blind horses, wandering aimlessly together. This is the second reason why the barbarians are bound to fail. The shifting of nations depends on heroes and is accomplished by the will of the people. Therefore, outstanding men rise up, the atmosphere changes, the people's hearts disintegrate, and chaos arises. In the past ten years, the giants of our race have been beheaded and disemboweled one after another. The people have become accustomed to it and cannot rise up in great numbers. The barbarians have seized the opportunity to maintain their position, delaying until now. They are enacting constitutionalism and changing officials, but they are false and untrustworthy, borrowing money and nationalizing railways, thus further trapping our people. A small spark can start a prairie fire. Between Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, and Guangdong, the common people are running around and shouting, and the valleys echo with their cries. One man raises his arm, and ten thousand follow. The collapsing wave overflows, capsizing the boats. This is the third reason why the barbarians are bound to fail. In the past, our ancestor, the Yellow Emperor, created China and possessed the nine provinces. Tang Yao and Yu Shun inherited the throne, and the Three Kings left their mark, so that culture flourished and was unique in the world. The glorious historical records span over four thousand years. Broad, great, benevolent and kind, the people's virtue has long been established. Compared with Western Europe, it is only slightly inferior in organization. The enlightened people, with their divine and sacred wisdom, should sit high on the earth and mediate in the universe. However, they have sharply declined and lowered their heads, becoming servants to others; disloyal, unfilial, lacking courage to defend their country, and unrighteous in losing their integrity. Hidden virtues and faint light are recalled from ancient times. Looking at our bodies, we feel ashamed. Returning to our true nature will bring clarity, and knowing shame will bring courage. 'Filial piety is inexhaustible and will forever bless your descendants.' This is the first reason why the Han people should flourish. 'When the Great Way prevails, the world belongs to all.' The state has a supreme authority, which is called human rights. Equality and freedom lead to joyful acceptance of destiny. Life is the foundation, law is the boundary, harmony is the virtue, and the people are the measure. One person acting tyrannically is called a 'despot.' King Wu of Zhou set an example by overthrowing him. The Manchus have secretly stolen and become even more arrogant, dividing up the country and stationing troops, living off the common people. High salaries and official positions are all given to their descendants, who flatter and deceive and make arbitrary decisions in the court. They dispose of the country and its rights as they please, restrict our speech, suppress our large gatherings, disturb our neighborhoods, slander our good people, eliminate our talented scholars, seize our people's property, imprison our representatives, and kill our councilors. Heaven and earth are dark, and the people's voices are suppressed. The plains of Muye are vast, and the army of King Wu is glorious. We will restore our freedom and return to our homeland. This is the second reason why the Han people should flourish. The sea is rising, and powerful forces are joining together. Weak countries and small races are treated like dogs and pigs. The people have collective virtues, and the court has heroes. Their power can reach far, and they survive through competition. Although our China is endangered by distant barbarians, the foundations are uneven, and the national strength has been exhausted. The barbarians are even more incompetent. Their fish is rotten, their meat is spoiled, and the stench spreads everywhere. They have attracted enemies to take advantage of the situation. Border areas have been cut off and taken away, and they are attacking our backs and throats, reaching even our ancestral temples. Their snoring arises at our bedside. Our eyes and ears are covered, and our hands and feet are entangled, causing us to lose the depths of our Han land. The spirit of the people is weakened, and we are about to be shattered and devoured by pigs. If we do not remove Qingfu, the troubles of Lu will never end. Purifying and clearing it, and excellent heroes and great men will meet hand in hand. All directions will be solemn, and all enemies will disappear. This is the third reason why the Han people should flourish. We, the fierce and brave men from all directions, the heroes of the world, having understood this righteousness, should each lead ten brothers and rise up at the opportune moment, gather in response, and eliminate all harm, whether great or small, capture the wicked, and present our achievements. We, our uncles, brothers, aunts, and sisters, having understood this righteousness, should pledge our determination, unite in large groups, persevere in our virtue, and exert our strength, advancing to fight and retreating to defend, together with the brave men. You, disloyal scholars and friends, soldiers who have been coerced, you have a body, you are also Han people. Having understood this righteousness, you should repent, quickly do good, always remember your roots, and think of your ancestors. Turn your spears and do not oppose the righteous army, and do not be troublemakers. You Manchus, you are in Han land, you are prisoners. Having understood this righteousness, you should know the will of heaven, return to your tribes, or change your nature and appearance, and be willing to become commoners. Then you will be innocent, and you will be pardoned. The Military Government makes the following agreement with the heroes from all directions: From the state and county level downwards, each should kill the Manchu officials and replace them with elected people, protecting their territory and governing it. Each state and county should also raise an army to share the common hatred and focus on conquest, killing the Manchu officials and cleaning up the provincial capitals, and governing with republicanism. The Military Government will then select generals and soldiers and personally lead six armies to sweep away the court and restore our China and establish the Republic of China. The Military Government also makes the following agreement with the army: All Han people or Manchus who have been coerced, as long as they surrender unconditionally, will be pardoned. Those who gather a crowd with weapons and resist will be killed without mercy! Those who violate military law will be killed without mercy! This is announced to the world as law!"</p>
<h3>A Casual Discussion of National Days of Various Countries</h3>
<p>Once a year, it's the Double Tenth again. While celebrating, let's talk about the national days of various countries around the world, based on the materials at hand.</p>
<p>The one that impresses us the most is France's national day. Because before the war, there was a French Concession in Shanghai, the crazy celebration on July 14th must still be remembered by the citizens of Shanghai. At that time, the Gujiazhai Park (now Fuxing Park) had a triumphal archway made of brightly lit electric torches at the entrance, and the park was filled with tricolor flags and red and green electric lights, shining like trees of fire and silver flowers. Small trains, bridges, tunnels, and other children's toys were also set up. The military parade was held domestically. In the concession, from the Bund along Avenue Joffre to Avenue Foch and Route Ferguson, both sides of the road were decorated with red, white, and blue lights and flags. The French Consulate, the French Police Department Fire Brigade, French companies, private residences, and French warships anchored in the Huangpu River were all decorated with lights, starting at nine o'clock on the thirteenth night. It was truly a city that never sleeps, as beautiful as paradise. For several years, there were also lantern parades at night, which were truly lively.</p>
<p>A newspaper from 1937 recorded: "The lantern procession started from the French Concession Police Department at the Grand Clock Tower, passing Avenue Edward VII, Rue Montigny, Rue Ningxing, and Avenue Joffre. First, there were two large red cloth flags with pointed corners, with the white characters 'Grand Clock Tower' written on them. Various colorful paper-made lanterns followed, some rectangular, some cylindrical, all colorful, carried by Annamese girls. A decorated sedan chair with drums was carried by six people, surrounded by a group of musicians playing loudly. Following them was an Annamese man dressed as Jiang Taigong, holding a fishing net and rod, shaking his head and wagging his tail, performing various poses on the road. Then came paper models of cranes, dragon heads, large green frogs, and green-haired turtles, worn by people who crawled on the ground. There were also many armed Frenchmen with shakos and spears following behind to supervise. Firecrackers were set off along the way. At each intersection, the lights and flags formed a large circle, allowing the dragon lanterns, frogs, cranes, turtles, and Jiang Taigong to jump around in the circle. The crowd watching the excitement was very crowded. At half-past nine, a heavy rain suddenly fell, and the lantern parade ended in a disappointing manner." At that time, the crowd watching the excitement truly came from all directions like a tide. The wall of people formed on both sides of the road was several feet thick, so tragedies often occurred in the comedy, such as children getting lost, women being insulted, or pregnant women having their stomachs crushed, which increased the news material in the next day's newspapers.</p>
<p>The British national day is also the royal family's happy event. The most lively one was the coronation ceremony of King George VI in 1937. All British territories around the world celebrated enthusiastically. London, the place where the coronation was held, was of course an unprecedented spectacle. Preparations began three months in advance, costing more than 150,000 pounds. Countries sent representatives to observe. A few days before the ceremony, London was decorated anew. "Flagpoles lined the roads, reaching high into the sky, topped with huge crowns and small flags. Some were decorated as shields, adorned with fresh flowers, and others were decorated with the initials of the king and queen, GE, in colorful splendor. The sidewalks were filled with stands, also adorned with fresh flowers. Curious people from all over the city came to watch, and the crowds were bustling and crowded." On the eve of the coronation, "before it was dark, the crowd had gathered on the road where the parade would pass, preparing to wait all night. Some were old and frail, and others brought tents, preparing to sleep on the street. By midnight, the entire road was filled with four or five rows of people." On the day of the coronation, after the ceremony was completed, the king and queen left Westminster Abbey to return to the palace. "At that time, despite the heavy rain, the crowds on the road were like mountains and seas. Upon seeing the royal carriage, they all cheered loudly, and the cheers lasted for a long time. Tens of thousands of people gathered in front of Buckingham Palace, singing 'God Save the King' and shouting that they wanted to see the king and the little princess. The king, queen, and princess then appeared on the balcony, and the crowd cheered at them. By nine o'clock in the evening, the crowd had not yet dispersed." It is estimated that the crowd watching the coronation parade that day was about two million people. More than 9,000 people felt unwell or were injured in accidents in the crowd, and one elderly man was suffocated to death. Afterwards, the streets where the parade passed were covered with paper scraps, newspapers, glass bottles, orange peels, and so on, and a large number of sanitation workers had to be dispatched to clean them up.</p>
<p>Americans are a young and enthusiastic people, and they always celebrate to the fullest when they are happy, let alone the country's Independence Day. So every year on American Independence Day, we can probably read in the newspapers about many people encountering accidents and dying in the celebrations. This can be said to be "extreme joy turns to sorrow." Last year was the first American Independence Day after the victory, and the celebration of the American community in Shanghai was also very lively. That day, "At 11:00 a.m., Fuzhou Road was bustling with traffic. The Consul General in Shanghai, Davis, hosted officers of the Navy and Army and expatriates on the second floor of the American Club. Hundreds of guests attended, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. At 12:00 noon, Davis read the President's proclamation, and the entire audience unanimously raised their glasses to wish the President good health. From 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., the cruiser USS Los Angeles was open to guests, with flags and decorations, presenting a new look. At 9:00 p.m., naval vessels fired searchlights, and silver snakes danced across the Huangpu River, shining brilliantly. The smoke and fog on the river, illuminated by the strong light, seemed to be covered with a layer of cyan gauze, and the lights repeatedly shone on the majestic buildings along the river, creating a wonderful spectacle with alternating light and dark. The French Club on Avenue Joffre and the Navy and Army Clubs on Nanjing Road and the Racecourse also held grand balls, partying until late at night."</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's celebration of the October Revolution anniversary often had a demonstrative nature, especially in 1940 when the situation in Europe was very tense. According to a TASS news report, the entire nation celebrated enthusiastically, and the streets were packed with people. Workers, employees, cultural figures, and students all held solemn gatherings in their factories and schools. At ten o'clock, the masses entered the Red Square to watch the military parade. When Stalin and others entered the square, the masses greeted them with enthusiastic cheers. At the commemoration, Marshal Timoshenko delivered a speech urging the entire nation to unite and saying, "The Red Army is fully prepared to meet the enemy." Immediately, the troops were inspected for an hour and a half, which was a powerful demonstration of the Red Army's strength. During the inspection, various Soviet aircraft also flew over the Red Square, and armored tanks and new-style cannons made a particularly deep impression. On this day, the Soviet Overseas Chinese General Association in Shanghai initiated and invited Latvian, Lithuanian, and Estonian expatriates to participate in a dance party, which lasted for five days, and screened the Soviet productions "Mutual Award" and Lenin's film "1918." The Soviet Overseas Chinese Association also invited White Russians from the city to participate, but was rejected. The White Russians all went to the White Russian Church that day to pray, to express their mourning.</p>
<p>The Netherlands in Northern Europe is a kingdom, and Queen Wilhelmina is deeply loved by the people. During the war, the Netherlands suffered greatly from the ravages of war, but now the country has been restored and is being governed in an orderly manner. This year, on February 18, the fourth granddaughter of the queen was born, and the whole country celebrated wildly. A special correspondent for this newspaper wrote: "The traditional historical custom of the Netherlands is that whenever there is a major event in the royal family, they always first use cavalry to gallop and report to the people. On this day, all the cities and towns, big and small, in the entire territory closed for a day, and men and women, old and young, came out of their homes, and you could see the cavalry riding ahead as the vanguard, dignified and majestic. Overall, the celebrations in the cities are similar, and the following points are worth noting: * Automatic military vehicles bearing congratulations to the royal family departed and converged from all directions, with the palace where the queen's granddaughter was born as the final destination. * Flag parades under the clear sky and beautiful sun, * Lively youth marching bands, * Flag-raising speeches and music in the city's squares, * Dances in the streets and alleys in front of the lights, * Church bells ringing in prayer…"</p>
<p>Switzerland, known as the world's park, is located between several powerful countries in Europe, but it has never suffered from the ravages of war in the two world wars. It can truly be said to be a paradise on earth. Switzerland is now celebrating the establishment of the republic, and the national day is on August 1. They are prosperous and wealthy, and the joy of the national day is of course incomparable to other countries. The Swiss have a special custom for celebrating the national day, which is to set off fireworks all over the mountains and fields. From a distance, they look like strings of pearls shining with light. It is said that in the 13th century, when Switzerland was not yet unified, the residents of the three cantons, such as Schwyz, who loved freedom, united to form a confederation, agreeing to use the lighting of beacons as a signal to help each other resist foreign insults. Therefore, Switzerland always sets off fireworks on the national day to commemorate the founders of this federal system. The Swiss love ancient customs very much. On the national day, farmers all over the country wear colorful costumes and parade with percussion instruments, singing and dancing, accompanied by the "ding-ding-dong" sound of cowbells, truly giving people a feeling of "ascending to immortality." And the Swiss are extremely hospitable. Their cheese is famous all over the world. If you are lucky enough to be a guest in Switzerland and happen to encounter the national day, they will definitely treat you to a feast!</p>
<h3>National Day Hair Cutting in Beijing</h3>
<p>Beijing held its first National Day celebration, which was extremely solemn, and "Daqingmen" was renamed "Zhonghuamen" to commemorate it. In the afternoon, citizens went to various venues, and the crowds were like mountains and seas, filling the streets. In Liulichang, there were 100,000 people. There were various places for entertainment, the main thing being the performance of new revolutionary dramas. There was also a place where portraits of deceased and living revolutionary heroes were displayed. There was also one thing that could make people laugh, which was that several people gathered outside the city gates, holding scissors to wait. Anyone with a queue had to have it cut off before being allowed to enter the city. Most people remained silent and had their queues cut off. Only a few people angrily fled. Before long, the queues on the ground formed a large pile.</p>
<p>In addition, the people of the whole city were extremely joyful. Both Chinese and foreigners said that they had never seen such unity of purpose. However, the Manchu nobles did not show up, which is worthy of attention. They were deeply afraid that their appearance would arouse jealousy among the Han people, so they dared not appear. This was truly an unnecessary fear. Only Yinchang and Sheng Xuanhuai participated in the ceremony and were treated as honored guests. The people outside the city were all excited, dancing and singing, because of the celebration, while there was no movement in the Forbidden City. The people living in it were no longer noticed by the people, which shows that the city was already lonely and uninhabited.</p>
<h3>Oath of President Yuan to Assume Office as Provisional President</h3>
<p>Oath:</p>
<p>The Republic of China is at the beginning of construction, and everything awaits governance. Shikai deeply wishes to exert his abilities, promote the spirit of the Republic, and cleanse away the flaws of autocracy. I will strictly abide by the Constitution and fulfill the wishes of the people, to lead the country to a safe and strong realm, so that the five major ethnic groups can achieve prosperity and happiness together. I will fulfill these aspirations without wavering. After the convocation of the National Assembly and the election of the first President, Shikai will immediately relinquish his office. I sincerely swear to my compatriots.</p>
<p>March 10th of the First Year of the Great Republic of China, Yuan Shikai.</p>
<h3>A Record of Yuan Shikai's Inauguration Oath on Double Tenth</h3>
<p>In the Double Tenth Festival of the eleventh year of the Republic of China, Yuan Kewen, son of Yuan Shikai, wrote an article entitled "Looking Back on the Double Tenth Festival," published in a certain newspaper in this city. A passage in it described the situation when Yuan Shikai took the oath of office in Beijing in the second year of the Republic of China in great detail, which is transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>"The Double Tenth Festival of the year Gui Chou was the beginning of the Republic's celebration of its founding, and also the day when my late father took office. On that day, it was drizzling, and the cold and gloom were heavy. I attended my late father, riding in a carriage into the Taihe Gate and ascending the Taihe Hall. In the center of the hall, the steps were left vacant, and there was no seat. My late father ascended the steps to take the oath, and the diplomatic corps, councilors, and civil and military officials stood to the left and right of the steps. After my late father took the oath, he went out to Tiananmen Square to review the troops. It was solemn and dignified, with a myriad of aspects. In the years Jia Yin and Yi Mao, when the government was peaceful, it was extremely magnificent. After Bing Chen, the world became increasingly chaotic, and the National Day was inferior year by year. This year's celebration happened to be the twentieth day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar, which was my late father's birthday. Natural disasters have befallen us, and the scourge of war has resumed. Recalling the past and cherishing the memory, I am deeply grieved! I write a few words to record my sorrow!"</p>
<h3>First National Day in Nanjing</h3>
<p>For the first National Day commemoration, all sectors of Nanjing were filled with fervent enthusiasm, especially the military. Since receiving the Governor-General's circular, officers and soldiers alike believed that the establishment of the Republic of China was achieved through the efforts of us soldiers. Therefore, they all willingly donated one-tenth of their salaries to be used as commemorative expenses. In front of the 8th Division Headquarters, two triangular lamp stands made of pine branches were erected, with paper flowers along the edges and national flags and army flags embedded in the center. At night, they shone brightly, resembling a city that never sleeps. The 3rd and 7th Divisions also used pine branches and flowers to build arches in the nearby prosperous streets, adorned with electric lights for a spectacular sight. Consequently, the number of men and women who came to view the spectacle was such that they were jostling shoulder to shoulder.</p>
<p>The Governor-General's Office dispatched personnel to Wan Duo Palace on Zhongzheng Street to prepare various items for the sacrifices to the martyrs. This took as long as two weeks and was quite thorough. The words "崇德" [Cherishing Virtue] were made of flowers at the East Gate, and "報功" [Rewarding Merit] at the West Gate. The screen wall was decorated with five-color electric light flags, dazzling the eyes. Beside it, the four characters "革命紀念" [Revolutionary Commemoration] were made of pine flowers. Inside the main gate, a plaque was embedded with the eight characters "山河奠定，復旦光華" [The Mountains and Rivers are Settled, and the Dawn Shines Brightly]. In the center, there was an altar for the martyrs who died for the Republic of China, surrounded by floral decorations. National flags were flying in the corridors, and national flags or army and navy flags were hung at all doors. At night, when the electric lights were turned on, the scene was especially brilliant.</p>
<p>The evenings of the 9th, 10th, and 11th were the most lively, with all the troops holding lantern parades. Ordinary lanterns were decorated with five-color national flags or inscribed with phrases such as "Revolution Anniversary Commemoration," "Restoration Commemoration," or "Iron-Blooded Nation Building Anniversary Commemoration." Special lanterns included lion lanterns, symbolizing the awakening of China like a sleeping lion. Other various flower lanterns had different names and appearances. Amidst the colorful and bizarre scenes, military songs could be heard from time to time. Whenever they passed the Governor-General's Office or Wanshou Palace, they shouted "Long Live the Commemoration" three times. The 8th Division, 7th Division, and the Mint all set off fireworks, attracting tens of thousands of spectators, truly a rare sight.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 10th, the Governor-General's Office hosted a banquet for consuls from various countries and key personnel from various bureaus and offices, as well as independent battalions and regiments of various troops. In addition, there were over 150 people from the Self-Government Office, political circles, academic circles, and business circles, filling the seats. Governor-General Cheng delivered a speech before the banquet, with extremely humble words, which was met with thunderous applause. At 3 p.m. in the afternoon, Mr. Huang Xing gave a speech on "Revolutionary History" at the First Stage, stating that the establishment of the Republic of China was due to the continuous efforts of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives. Today, as we celebrate this grand event, we should not forget the suffering of the martyrs who died last year and before. From now on, building the republic is the responsibility of those who strive, otherwise, how can we face the spirits of the martyrs in heaven? In the evening, Governor-General Cheng again invited the staff of the Governor-General's Office for a Western-style dinner.</p>
<h3>Li Yadong Becomes an Official, Qin Liming Looks After Horses</h3>
<p>After the Wuchang Uprising and the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty, some comrades did not fully understand the significance of the revolution, thinking that since the world had been won, they could enjoy being officials. Ju Juesheng, the president of the academy, recorded an anecdote about the party members in his "Meichuan Diary," which is quite interesting. After the success of the revolution, Li Yadong, a party member, was released from prison and appointed to govern Hanyang Prefecture. He immediately bought a blue silk robe and a black mandarin jacket, and every day he sat in a green sedan chair carried by four people, just like the Qing Dynasty prefect's inspection tour. In front, there were flags, umbrellas, and attendants, and gongs were sounded to clear the way, with people shouting and crowding around, a display of great power. Zhang Nanxian saw this and advised him, but he retorted that such a display would let the people know that there was an official. If there were no flags and umbrellas, there would be no dignity. One day, Li went to the Governor-General's Office, still with flags, umbrellas, and a sedan chair, and gongs were sounded to clear the way, but he was stopped by the guards of the Governor-General's Office, who scolded him as a monster from the Qing Dynasty and shouted for him to be beaten. Li was so frightened that his face turned pale and he did not make a sound.</p>
<p>There is another anecdote about Qin Zhen looking after horses, also recorded in the "Meichuan Diary." (Note: Qin was the former Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, who passed away in Shanghai a few months ago.) After Qin was released from prison in Hunan, he went to Wuchang to visit Hu Ying at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Hu spoke to him in an official tone, saying, "Liming, you have come too late. The Ministry does not have any good positions. There is only the Yingwuzhou post station, with two horses that have not been assigned to anyone. The job is also easy. Are you willing to take it?" Qin smiled and left. As a result, the comrades all said, "Qin Zhen looks after horses."</p>

<h3>Chairman's National Day Addresses Over the Past Decade - A Towering Beacon of Victory - Joyfully Celebrating Double Ten Festival - Progress on Every Front</h3>
<p>Twenty-Sixth Year:</p>
<p>This year's National Day is the most critical period of hardship and suffering for our country, but it is also the only important period for the revival of our nation.</p>
<p>This war of resistance is a battle for survival from the brink of death, and we must go through extraordinary dangers and hardships to achieve final victory. All compatriots across the country must be truly aware that the initial efforts must be followed by greater courage and sacrifice. We must recognize that this war of resistance cannot be concluded in a short period of one and a half years. We must anticipate that the hardships and difficulties ahead will only intensify day by day. Therefore, we must prepare everything to face a situation that is dozens of times more difficult and arduous than today. Only by establishing the determination to sacrifice to the end can we achieve the goal of national survival.</p>
<p>On this important anniversary, I hope that everyone will be determined to follow the example of the revolutionary martyrs over the past few decades, step on the bloodstains of our soldiers at the front, and rise up together to work hard for the country. The war of resistance will definitely be victorious! The Republic of China will definitely have a bright and splendid future! otherwise, I would rather not receive assistance. The reason for this is that Britain does not want to bear the cost of freight in US dollars in addition to paying for the cost of assistance goods in US dollars, so as to make the international balance of payments more unfavorable. In theory, ocean transportation and international trade are inseparable. The huge amount of imports over the years, both before and after the war, has caused our country to remain in a state of poverty and weakness. Therefore, if we want to develop international trade today, on the one hand, we should encourage the production of export goods, and on the other hand, we should develop transportation and protect the shipping industry.</p>
<p>Although the tonnage of our country's ships is now more than 700,000 tons, given the vastness of our country's territory and the length of our shipping lines, the above-mentioned number of ship tons is certainly not enough for use. Now that the unequal treaties have been lifted and the United Kingdom and the United States are still strangely sympathetic to us, our government should seize this golden age to formulate policies to encourage Chinese people to engage in the shipping industry, and encourage shipbuilding and the establishment of water transport insurance, etc. If this can be done, the country's economic future will not be difficult to improve. Today, on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the founding of Shen Bao and the 75th anniversary of the founding of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, I dare to borrow a corner of the newspaper to make the following four suggestions to the wise government, hoping that our country will become rich and strong and make this a play:</p>
<p>Develop the shipping industry - on the one hand, add large-scale shipyards. During the current transition period, a large number of heavy-tonnage ships that can carry both passengers and goods can be ordered from foreign countries, and the navy can be sent to protect shipping when necessary.</p>
<p>Implement incentives - establish two types of bonuses: shipbuilding and business. For shipbuilding, the government will subsidize a considerable percentage as a bonus. For business, reward the ships and employees with fast, safe, and reliable voyages, and protect their profits.</p>
<p>Control the source of goods - the government has already promulgated several types of materials that are prohibited from being imported. This clear order must be firmly implemented by the customs. The transportation and entry of materials should be ordered by the Executive Yuan to all relevant agencies to use national transportation as much as possible.</p>
<p>Public insurance - ship hull insurance, cargo insurance, and freight insurance cannot be achieved unless the government operates a sound insurance institution to encourage shipping companies and cargo merchants to move forward bravely. Public insurance is not aimed at making profits, but at protecting shipping companies. It is better to operate this business with government credit than to do it privately. In this way, the shipping industry policy can be promoted, so that shipping companies can be fearless, and the shipping industry can make rapid progress. If our government can support the shipping industry to a considerable extent within five years or a certain period, international trade will inevitably shift to a favorable position. If the water transport equipment is strong and there are enough ships, the export of materials such as tung oil, bristles, mineral sand, tea, and firecrackers will not have to rely on foreign ships. Other handicrafts such as porcelain, embroidery, carvings, lacquerware, and medicines have long been welcomed by Westerners, and can all be transported abroad by our own ships to try to gain a market. From this, foreign exchange can be expected to be obtained continuously, and our country can use handicrafts to exchange for industrial machinery and utensils, so that agricultural China can slowly enter the path of industry, and truly rank among the world's powers with the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada.</p>
<p>Twenty-Seventh Year</p>
<p>Now our arduous struggle has been going on for another year. Comparing today's situation with this day last year, we have indeed lost more territory, more heroic soldiers and compatriots have died, and we have suffered more brutal and cruel sacrifices, but there is a very significant difference: this day last year, our compatriots' understanding of the future of the war of resistance was still somewhat vague and hesitant, but now there is a consistent and clear understanding.</p>
<p>Our war of resistance for more than a year has aroused the awakening of national consciousness among men, women, old and young throughout China. In the past fifteen months, countless compatriots have smelted a new national life with hope and a future in the reality of war.</p>
<p>Our Premier Sun Yat-sen advocated revolution all his life. His purpose was to "build the Republic of China and build the Great Harmony." Our victory in the war of resistance will not only make our country successful, but also make a very great contribution to world peace. But on the other hand, our current responsibility is also extremely important. I ask my compatriots across the country to pay special attention to the fact that now is the time of life and death for our China. Our Chinese nation can certainly prove to be free from the worries of being conquered or destroyed. But our struggle today is not only to prevent China from being conquered or destroyed, but to demand national independence and national equality, so that our Chinese nation can live permanently in equality and freedom in the world for generations to come, and achieve the ideal of building a country with great harmony.</p>
<p>Twenty-Eighth Year</p>
<p>To the elders, brothers, sisters, and compatriots in the occupied areas and throughout the country: Today is the 28th year of the arduous war of resistance of our Republic of China. Recalling the difficulties of the predecessors in creating the country and looking forward to the bright future of the revolution, I know that all my compatriots across the country must have the enthusiasm to strive forward and catch up, vowing to drive out the enemy and eliminate the traitors, so as to firmly lay the foundation for the independence and equality of our Republic of China. At this meeting of approaching final victory, it will inevitably become more difficult. On this glorious anniversary of the revolution, I would like to sincerely state the following few points to my compatriots:</p>
<p>First, my compatriots must recognize that our country today is a country in the midst of revolution, and our war of resistance is to realize the Three Principles of the People and complete the National Revolution. Revolutionary undertakings throughout history must go through countless dangers and difficulties to achieve success, and there is absolutely no reason to expect luck and quick success. However, once the revolutionary forces are launched, they will never stop until they achieve their goal.</p>
<p>Second, my compatriots should know that the success of the war of resistance in the future does not entirely depend on military advantages, but on how the spirit of common struggle of all compatriots across the country is.</p>
<p>Third, the only key to our victory in the war of resistance today lies in punishing the traitors and destroying the enemy's tools for political offense.</p>
<p>Compatriots! "It is easy to start, but difficult to finish." The great cause of revolution can only move forward and never look back. The great cause of war of resistance can only succeed and never fail.</p>
<p>Twenty-Ninth Year</p>
<p>Looking back on the establishment of our Republic of China, we must unanimously commemorate the Premier Sun Yat-sen, who struggled for the National Revolution all his life. Thanks to the great leadership of our Premier and the generous sacrifice of countless of our martyrs for the country, at this critical moment of the war of resistance and the unprecedented changes in the world, all our loyal soldiers and civilians across the country must uphold the teachings of the Premier and maintain a firm belief to make courageous efforts. If we want to drive out the enemy and complete the unfinished business of the martyrs, we must have the revolutionary spirit and fighting spirit of the martyrs.</p>
<p>Our country is indeed in a time of survival crisis, but today, compared with the environment in which the martyrs of the Xinhai Revolution were in and the environment in which the various countries were in during the revolution and nation-building, we are much better and more successful.</p>
<p>We must maintain our confidence, no matter what the environment. We must work hard when the international situation is favorable, and we must fight to the end even when the international situation is unfavorable to our war of resistance in the process.</p>
<p>The responsibility for the rise and fall of East Asia and the prosperity and decline of the world lies entirely on our generation. This responsibility cannot be avoided. We must stand firm and complete the great and solemn cause of saving the country and the world with the spirit of utmost loyalty, courage, benevolence, and love.</p>
<p>Thirtieth Year</p>
<p>There are two most memorable things in this year: one is that the great righteousness of international peace is clearly visible, and the anti-aggression camp is becoming more and more distinct; the other is that our country has entered a stage of equal international status, and the lifelong wish of the founding father to abolish unequal treaties has been achieved for the first time, which is truly a cause for celebration.</p>
<p>Our national intellectuals and social leaders must face reality squarely, recognize the characteristics of the Chinese revolution, shoulder the great responsibility for the rise and fall of the world, advocate that our compatriots devote themselves to production and science, so as to lay the foundation for national defense, enrich the economy, overcome all difficulties and dangers, and ensure victory.</p>
<p>At this time of revolutionary success and victory in sight, all my compatriots should be especially vigilant, do their best, and work diligently to complete the task.</p>
<p>Thirty-First Year</p>
<p>Our war of resistance is to seek nation-building, and the scale of nation-building must be completed during wartime. There are many aspects to the great cause of nation-building, but in summary, there are only two main ways: diligence and thrift, and realism. Since the New Year of this year, I have repeatedly urged my compatriots to practice wartime living and abide by the National Mobilization Law. However, today's society in general has no active and tense atmosphere, nor does it have a spirit of hard work and sincerity. I have never thought about the suffering of my compatriots in the occupied areas and the hardships of the soldiers at the front, who are frugal and risk their lives. If these bad habits are not fundamentally awakened and thoroughly eradicated, then our nation will inevitably perish without the enemy troops penetrating deep.</p>
<p>It must be known that wartime living is naturally difficult. Compared with the situation of the founding father and the revolutionary martyrs, who were exposed to the wind and rain and lacked food and clothing, we are far more prosperous. What's more, if we want to shoulder the great cause of the nation's revival and building for generations to come, we need to "suffer their minds, starve their bodies, and empty their bodies" to temper our bodies and minds and promote the nation's ambition, so as to be able to assume this important and far-reaching responsibility.</p>

<p>Thirty-Second Year</p>
<p>Compatriots of the military and civilians across the country: Today is the National Day of the 32nd year of the Republic of China. I am honored to take on the heavy responsibility of the National Government today. I feel that the burden is heavy and the responsibility is great.</p>
<p>The establishment of our Republic of China began with the success of the Xinhai Revolution. The rapid success of the Xinhai Revolution set an unprecedented example in world history. This fully proves that the goal of the National Revolution is the common trend of public opinion, and that our revolutionary nation-building and the realization of the Three Principles of the People are in accordance with the will of the people and the times. Although it has gone through many twists and turns, it will eventually succeed. In order to achieve this goal, we should especially promote the people's ambition and concentrate the people's strength. This requires my compatriots across the country to deeply understand the founding father's two last words: "The foundation of the country lies in the people" and "Hundreds of millions of people are connected to the country." Knowing the close relationship between the people and the country, we know that the realization of the Principle of Democracy is the basic work of nation-building. If our Principle of Democracy is fully realized, and 450 million compatriots jointly shoulder the heavy responsibility of the country and the nation, then the progress of our country will be even more limitless. The reason why the democratic politics of the Principle of Democracy is the ultimate goal of politics lies in this.</p>
<p>But we also need to know that the implementation of the Principle of Democracy has its necessary prerequisites. The spirit of democratic politics lies entirely in abiding by the law. If the law and discipline are not observed, then the democratic system will be fundamentally destroyed, and the Republic of China will also be in danger. Therefore, our citizens must understand the true meaning of freedom and the rule of law, and develop the habit of respecting freedom and abiding by the law and discipline, so that democratic politics can have a solid foundation. In any democratic country in the world, the exercise of civil rights and the enjoyment of freedom cannot exceed the scope of the rule of law. No matter how developed civil rights are and how broad freedom is, the statutory track must be consistent from top to bottom and jointly adhered to. All obligations stipulated by law should be actively fulfilled and not evaded. The rights stipulated by law should also be equally shared. Only in this way can democratic politics be truly realized and the Principle of Democracy can be fully completed. In the future, if our Republic of China wants to establish itself in the world, the whole country must develop the habit of abiding by the law, taking the interests of the country as the interests of the individual, and taking the fate of the nation as the fate of the individual, and not evading the responsibilities that should be fulfilled. Government officials must be loyal to their duties, and all the people should also share the responsibility and contribute their abilities. In this way, our citizens can be truly free citizens, and our country can obtain a truly equal position.</p>
<p>Thirty-Third Year</p>
<p>During these thirty-three years, our Republic of China has experienced countless worries and hardships, but ultimately broke through all kinds of dangers because of the sincerity of our compatriots across the country in loving the Republic of China and the determination to protect the Republic of China. Our sacred war of resistance has been going on for more than seven years, and now the final victory is already in sight. I want my compatriots across the country to have a practical review and clear understanding of the status of our country, the situation of the revolution, the current war situation, and the points that we should be vigilant about before the final victory is won.</p>
<p>First, I want to point out to my compatriots that our country today is a country in revolution, and our government and army are a government and army in the revolutionary period, and cannot be criticized and judged by routine. In terms of politics and economy, we are well aware that there are many shortcomings and weaknesses, and we will certainly actively improve and strive for progress. But you must know that there are many shortcomings and weaknesses that any country cannot avoid in the revolutionary period or when the country is at war. Therefore, we must not blame China alone for this, let alone use this as a weapon to criticize and attack the government, and only speak for the enemy and the traitors. Our revolutionary government and people only know how to base themselves on justice and reason in order to achieve their revolutionary goals and realize their Three Principles of the People. In the eyes of the revolutionaries, there is no concept of what is dangerous and what is failure.</p>
<p>Second, I want to point out to my compatriots is China's position in the international community today and our responsibility in the anti-aggression war. Everyone must know that no matter how the world war situation and its strategy change, the East Asian war today cannot be without our China. The future of world safety and peace is also closely related to the success or failure of our Chinese revolution. Because if the East Asian war does not have our staunch and hard-working China, it will not be possible to achieve a complete victory, and if the world peace does not have an independent and free China, there will be no truly realized day. Our country's position and responsibility for the world and mankind have such a significant relationship, so we must love ourselves, respect ourselves, and stand on our own feet and strengthen ourselves.</p>
<p>Thirty-Fourth Year</p>
<p>Today is the first National Day after our Republic of China's victory in the war of resistance. Today, we have finally achieved the goal of final victory, erasing the heavy shame of the past and welcoming the infinite hope of the future. In the future, we should work together and unite in mind and heart to promote the success of nation-building. There is only one goal for the work of our compatriots across the country, and that is "Nation-Building First." Therefore, I will propose three important guidelines related to construction today, and encourage my compatriots across the country to work together.</p>
<p>First, the guiding principle of economic construction - to improve social welfare in order to raise people's living standards.</p>
<p>Second, the guiding principle of cultural construction - to promote scientific research, protect academic freedom, and transform social customs.</p>
<p>Third, the guiding principle of political construction - to popularize the exercise of civil rights in order to consolidate the foundation of constitutional government.</p>
<p>The above three items are the guidelines for future construction, but the fundamental plan lies in the psychological construction and spiritual transformation of the people. Everyone must know that our country lacked a foundation before the war, and was destroyed during the war. We must also know that the world is progressing by leaps and bounds, and the times are constantly moving forward. We must recognize that recovery cannot be restoration, and victory is not rest. We must carry out extraordinary construction on the ruins of war, and thoroughly implement the Three Principles of the People at the opportunity to rebuild post-war society. We must follow the founding father's teaching of psychological construction that it is easy to know but difficult to act, and boost our nation's inherent spirit of breaking through all difficulties.</p>
<p>Thirty-Fifth Year</p>
<p>Our country has been 35 years since the Xinhai Revolution. The cause of our National Revolution has actually been progressing and advancing during these 35 years, but the distance to the final success of the National Revolution is naturally very far.</p>
<p>On this day last year, I stated that the work in the future is "Nation-Building First." The purpose of our National Revolution is to implement the Three Principles of the People and establish an equal, independent, and free Republic of China. The basic conditions for nation-building are national unity and social stability. If social order cannot be stabilized, then the lives and property of the people cannot be guaranteed, agricultural and industrial production will naturally not develop, and the living standards of the people will not be improved. At the same time, if national unity cannot be consolidated, then internal strife will inevitably occur frequently, the foundation of democracy will naturally not be established, and the cause of nation-building will not be able to begin. Therefore, the current policy of the government is to ensure national unity first, and seek unity through peaceful means. We know that the minimum conditions for national unity are the unity of military orders and political orders. To seek the unity of military orders, we must implement the nationalization of the army and establish a national army. To seek the unity of political orders, the national laws and regulations must be able to be implemented throughout the country and eliminate local separatism. If there are two opposing armies in a country and the local politics form a separatist situation, then it cannot be called a unified country.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want to strive for peace today, we must consolidate national unity. It can be said that there is no peace in China today without unity, and unity is the only condition for peace. If this condition is denied or destroyed, it will not only prolong the suffering of the people, but will also lead to the country's demise. This is the key to the vital interests and lives of every citizen, and it is also the government's inescapable responsibility. The government cannot ignore the rebellions that hinder unity and attempt to split the country, and the compatriots across the country cannot stand by and watch the disasters that endanger the nation's lifeline and destroy the lives of the people, and put the country and the nation in a place of eternal destruction.</p>
<h3>China's Shipping in the Past Eighty Years</h3>
<p>— Xu Xueyu</p>
<p>The Beginning of China's Shipping Industry and Early Competition</p>
<p>Since the beginning of our country's history, water transportation has relied on wooden boats and sailboats. It was not until the eleventh year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing dynasty (1872 in the Western calendar, 75 years ago) that, under the active promotion of Li Hongzhang, then Minister of the Northern Seas, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was established. From then on, Chinese people began to operate steamship transportation. During this period, merchants from England, America, France, Russia, Sweden, and Norway successively sailed their steamships into our country's coastal and inland rivers based on treaties (1842) and the Treaty of Tianjin (1858). The Chinese people, feeling that steamships were fast and reliable, were happy to use them. Foreigners profited greatly from this and used their profits to purchase our country's materials and transport them back to their countries. At the same time, our old wooden boats and sampans were gradually eliminated, causing hardship for the people. At that time, patriotic people were deeply worried about this, which was also the reason why Chinese merchants established steamship companies.</p>
<p>In the fourth year of Tongzhi (1865), Zeng Guofan established the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai, which was the beginning of Chinese people running their own shipyard. When the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was established (1872), the shipyard had already built four merchant ships. However, Song Jin, a cabinet scholar, reported that shipbuilding was too costly and requested that it be stopped. The emperor instructed Li Hongzhang and Zuo Zongtang to make overall plans. Li believed that manufacturing steamships could resist foreign aggression and benefit merchants, so it should not be abolished. He also proposed that after the official ships were completed, they should be leased to merchants for use to benefit shipping and increase the treasury revenue. In the summer of that year, Li Hongzhang ordered Zhu Qiyang to draft steamship regulations. On December 16 of the same year, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was officially opened in Shanghai. The iron seal on the office bore the ten characters "General Office of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company". They first purchased the "Eden" steamship from British merchants and ordered two more ships, "Douglas" and "Li Yun". The earliest routes extended north to Tianjin and Tanggu, south to Hong Kong and Guangzhou, and west to Nagasaki and Kobe, with Shanghai as the center. Since then, under the official-merchant joint system, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships were also used for government errands, operating diligently and striving to improve.</p>
<p>The biggest rivals of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company when it was established were the British company "Taigoo Dockyard and Engineering Company" and the American company "Russell &amp; Company". The "Pacific Mail Steamship Company" was the British "China Navigation Company" established in 1867 (five years earlier than the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company). When the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was established, the company's tonnage in China had reached 100,000 tons, also engaged in the transportation of passengers and goods. "Russell &amp; Company" and the Far East manager of the American "Flag Shipping Company" were established in China in 1869. When the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was established, the company also owned 60,000 tons of ships and purchased a large amount of property on the wharves along the Yangtze River and in the northern and southern oceans. In addition, "Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co." was the Far East manager of the British "India Steam Navigation Company". It was established in China almost at the same time as the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Other companies included the American "Admiral Oriental Line", the British "British India Steam Navigation Company" and "Butterfield &amp; Swire", the French "Messageries Maritimes", the German "Hamburg America Line", and the Swedish "Swedish East Asia Company". They all freely sailed their ships into our country's coastal waters and would occasionally seize any passengers or goods to transport into the Yangtze River. However, the other foreign steamship companies mentioned above did not set up separate offices in China. Therefore, when the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was founded, it was truly like a weak child standing among a group of adults, trying to seize the position of those adults. Taigoo, Russell &amp; Company, and Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co., fearing that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company would flourish, repeatedly reduced their fares to attract business after the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was established. However, those foreign companies were mutually undercutting each other and found it difficult to maintain. Russell &amp; Company, due to falling prices, suffered unsustainable losses and, in the third year of Guangxu (1877), willingly conceded and sold its real estate and ships in Shanghai and other ports to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. From then on, the company's reputation grew stronger, and the British Taigoo Dockyard and Engineering Company became increasingly jealous, further reducing prices to compete. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was once almost unable to maintain itself. Fortunately, Li Hongzhang reorganized and encouraged it, and decreed that all grain tribute from the country must be transported by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships, and reduced and exempted taxes. Only then was the company able to continue operating. Li Hongzhang's efforts to support the operation of shipping by Chinese people at that time can be called the earliest guardian of Chinese shipping, truly a rare enlightened and virtuous talent among the officials of the time. Sheng Xuanhuai, the director-general of the company, devised ways to acquire Russell &amp; Company, purchased ships of all sizes, and personally managed affairs. His achievements were second only to Li.</p>
<p>Under the support of Li, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company devoted all its efforts to compete with foreign shipping companies. By the twenty-sixth year of Guangxu (1900), it had established a solid foundation. In addition to purchasing a large amount of real estate and building warehouses and wharves in various navigable areas across the country, it also owned more than twenty ships of various sizes. At that time, the book assets had reached 9,587,000 taels, which were used to develop the Tangshan, Dongliu, Xuancheng, and Pingxiang coal mines, and invested heavily in the establishment of the Commercial Bank of China (when the bank was established in the twenty-second year of Guangxu, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company invested 800,000 taels, accounting for one-third of the commercial shares at the time).</p>
<p>In the thirty-first year of Guangxu (1905), Zhang Qian and Zhang Jian established the "Da Da Steamship Company" with a capital of 600,000 taels, establishing its headquarters in Shanghai. It initially purchased one steamship, specializing in navigating the Yangtze River, becoming the second Chinese-established steamship company. Following in its footsteps were: (1) the "Ning Shao Steamship Company", "San Bei Steamship Company", and "Hong An Steamship Company" founded by Yu Hede and others from the Xuan Tong reign to the early years of the Republic. The ships of these three companies sailed on the Yangtze River and in the Shanghai-Ningbo area, with their headquarters all located in Shanghai. (2) The "Zheng Ji Steamship Company", jointly established by Zhang Benzheng and Zhang Bencai, with its headquarters in Yantai. Its routes were Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Yingkou, Dalian, and Weihaiwei, making it the largest shipping company in the Northern Seas area at that time. (3) In the Northern Seas area, there was also the "Zhi Dong Steamship Company" founded by Li Xuyuan and the "Northeast Shipping Bureau" run by the three northeastern provinces. (4) In the Yangtze River and South China areas, there were the "Bei Fang Steamship Company" founded by Zheng Xiaosan and the "Da Tong Steamship Company" founded by Lu Bohong. Around the tenth year of the Republic, the establishment of steamship companies sprang up like mushrooms after rain, growing rapidly. The reason for this was partly that the Chinese people did not want funds to flow out and therefore established shipping to compete with foreign merchants. Also, during the First World War, many foreign merchant ships were recalled by their respective governments for use, and our country had not yet joined the war, so there was a large output of materials, urgently needing transportation tools. This caused our country's shipping industry to become increasingly developed.</p>
<p>The Japanese Empire, neighboring our country, seeing that England and the United States had made huge profits from operating shipping in our country, was unwilling to fall behind. In 1907, it established the Japan-Taiwan Steamship Joint-Stock Company, with its headquarters in Tokyo. This company was formed by the Osaka Shosen Kaisha, Rokuto Steamship Company, Nippon Yusen Kaisha, and Konan Kisen Kaisha. Since the company was established in the late Qing Dynasty (1907), our country's shipping industry had one more strong rival. (Continued on page 20)</p>

<h3>The Beginning and End of the 1911 Revolution</h3>
<p>The Wuchang Uprising on October 10, 1911, overthrew the Qing Dynasty and established the Republic, now thirty-six years ago.</p>
<p>Since then, every year on this National Day holiday, there has been a grand commemoration. And there are many written records about the events of the 1911 Revolution. Newspaper articles were news at the time and later became historical material. We have compiled relevant articles published in Shen Bao thirty-six years ago as a commemoration of the 1911 Revolution, to commemorate National Day.</p>
<p>On October 10, 1911, revolutionary party members in Wuchang joined the New Army to launch an uprising. At 9 p.m. on the tenth, the soldiers of the Eighth Engineering Battalion, because they had not received firearms and ammunition, believed that the Qing officials were discriminating against them, and took the opportunity to make noise and start a riot. They clashed with the Manchus, and the two sides exchanged fire for half an hour. Soon, it spread to various battalions. All government offices below the governor-general's office were targeted by artillery shells. The telegraph bureau and the barracks were all burned. Qing Admiral Zhang Biao was about to lead his troops out of the office to command when he was shot and wounded by the New Army. Qing Governor-General of Hubei Rui Cheng hurriedly took refuge on a warship. Wuchang was occupied by the revolutionary army, opening the prelude to the 1911 Revolution.</p>
<p>The revolutionary army originally planned to launch the uprising on October 7, but changed it to the 9th. Unexpectedly, on the 9th, two revolutionary party members were captured in the Russian concession in Hankou. It was discovered that the uprising would take place simultaneously in Wuhan in the middle of the night. The Qing Governor-General of Hubei received a telegram from the Hankou Jianghanguan Customs at about 9 p.m. on the 9th and immediately took precautions, closing the city gates and strictly checking pedestrians. That night, dozens of explosives were found in the Anhui Guild Hall and the Xiangyang Academy in Xiaochao. More than 20 revolutionary party members were arrested. Peng Zefan and two others were executed. This was the blow suffered by the revolutionary party members on the eve of the Wuchang Uprising of the 1911 Revolution.</p>
<p>This was not the first uprising of the revolutionary party members. The Guangzhou Uprising in 1895, the Huizhou Uprising in 1900, the Changping Uprising in 1904, the Anqing Uprising in 1906, the Zhennanguan Uprising and the Huanghuagang Uprising in Guangzhou were all brave and energetic, and the power to arouse people's hearts was not small. However, every time the revolutionary party launched an uprising, it was often discovered by the Qing officials in advance, and each time it failed, many people were arrested and killed. After the failure of the Huanghuagang Uprising, they began to focus all their attention on Wuhan. After being discovered, everyone regretted it.</p>
<p>After the secret agency of the revolutionary party in Wuchang was cracked down, they had to launch the uprising hastily, capturing Wuchang unexpectedly, and it became an unstoppable trend. This was something that everyone did not expect. From a geographical point of view, Wuhan is located in the center of the country, bordering the two provinces of Hunan and Guangdong, which are the base of the revolutionary party, so there is no need to worry about the rear. The people of Sichuan were fighting for the railway and had no intention of immediate change, but the officials acted arbitrarily, recklessly killing people, and the people's resentment was deep. Now that the revolutionary army has captured Wuchang, blocking the path for reinforcements to enter Sichuan, and at the same time, the resentment has erupted, making the situation in Sichuan even more difficult to settle. As for the provinces in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the people's hearts have long been lost. Even if they do not immediately launch an uprising, there is no reason to come to help. Therefore, even though the revolutionary army only has the city of Wuchang, the whole country is in a state of turmoil.</p>
<p>The Wuchang Uprising began with the advocacy of the new soldiers, and spread rapidly to various battalions. The artillery guarding the governor's office also tied white cloth and fired inward outside the gate. Before long, a fire broke out in the main office of Wangfu Street, which was close to the governor's office, and the Qing officials were terrified. Rui Cheng and his family disguised themselves and fled. At that time, the artillery and cavalry had rushed in from the Baoan Gate and the Fan Gate, shouting and killing along the way. Fires broke out everywhere, as bright as day. Government offices were either hit by artillery or burned down. Many Manchus were killed, and the police also took off their clothes and hats and fled. After a night of chaos, all government offices were occupied by the revolutionary army. All Qing officials, even those who had not escaped outside the city, were hiding in civilian houses. The troops that had not yet launched the uprising had seen the revolutionary army in Tongxiangmen, Qianjin, and Hanyang, and the sound of gunfire continued from the tenth to the twelfth.</p>
<p>While stabilizing Wuchang, the revolutionary army sent many people to Hankou, occupying Dazhimen. The vagrants in the Hankou Concession, hearing of the Wuchang Uprising, set fires everywhere, which spread rapidly. The revolutionary party members put out the fires and immediately occupied the Chinese界, issuing notices to reassure the people. The Hankou defense army also surrendered. The party members initially planned to occupy the Jiang'an Station in Dazhimen, destroying the railway to prevent the Northern Army from moving south. Just then, the Bian Army arrived with about 12,000 soldiers and fought with the revolutionary party in the Jiang'an Station area. At that time, Hankou still had concessions from various countries, and the revolutionary party did its best to protect foreigners, announcing that they were not allowed to harm foreigners or foreign volunteers. This won the sympathy of various countries, so all countries strictly maintained neutrality.</p>
<p>Hanyang was also occupied by the revolutionary army. The Hanyang Prefect fled, and the Hanyang Arsenal was also acquired by the revolutionary army, obtaining countless military supplies.</p>
<p>The Hanyang Gate When the Revolutionary Army Occupied Wuchang</p>
<p>After the revolutionary party occupied the three towns of Wuhan, they made strict arrangements to resist. Artillery platforms were built on Snake Hill and Turtle Hill in Wuchang to shoot at warships in the river. In Hankou, the railway tracks and bridges were destroyed. Troops were sent to Xinyangguan to resist the Northern Army. At the same time, they restored local order. Local affairs were handed over to the Consultative Bureau. Announcements were made to notify shops to open for business, prohibiting looting and disturbing public order, and protecting foreigners. Wuhan gradually stabilized.</p>
<p>After Rui Cheng took refuge on a warship, he telegraphed Sa Zhenbing, the Qing Navy Minister in Shanghai, ordering him to drive warships to Hankou. Sa Zhenbing led three warships upstream to Hankou and engaged in battle on the Wuhan river. One large warship was sunk by the revolutionary army, and the other two were also damaged. Then, because the consuls of various countries in Hankou said that the concessions were in the line of fire and very dangerous, they declared to the Qing Foreign Ministry, so they retreated downstream. In fact, part of the navy had already joined the revolutionary party, so they all fired into the sky, while the artillery set up by the revolutionary army on Snake Hill and Turtle Hill was aimed very accurately.</p>
<p>Compared with the revolutionary party and the Qing government, the Qing government had two towns and the assistance of various provinces, while the revolutionary party's military strength was less than one town, and the Qing government seemed to have the upper hand. However, the revolutionary army was able to cooperate with one heart and rise up together, while the Qing government's troops, many of whom were new soldiers, had joined the revolutionary party, and those who did not join the revolutionary party did not fight hard when they opened fire. Moreover, the righteous banner in Wuhan was raised, and all sides responded, from Qi and Yan in the far north to Xiang and Bian in the near, and Sichuan, Jiangnan, Liangzhe, Linghai, Yunnan, and Guizhou all showed signs of moving. At the same time, Manchu officials, hearing the news of the revolutionary party, were only afraid of fleeing, abandoning the city as if it were tattered shoes, truly in a state of panic and suspicion. The revolutionary party obeyed Heaven and responded to the times, so it was easy to succeed.</p>
<p>In less than three days, the revolutionary party had occupied the three towns of Wuhan. The news spread to Beijing, and the Qing government was shocked and did not know what to do. It immediately appointed Yinchang, the Minister of the Imperial Guard, to lead the army south to meet with Sa Zhenbing's navy. Later, seeing that the situation was becoming increasingly tense, and there were rumors of independence in various provinces, the people's hearts were lost. The Qing government then reappointed Yuan Shikai as the Governor-General of Huguang and Cen Chunxuan as the Governor-General of Sichuan to win back the people's hearts and stabilize the political situation, but it was too late.</p>
<p>When Yinchang had not yet led the large army south, the revolutionary army had sent troops to Yangzhou, preparing to intercept the Northern Army. On the 17th, the Bian Army met the revolutionary army on the border of Hubei and engaged in a small battle, repelling the Bian Army. At that time, the Bian Army was waiting for Yinchang's reinforcements to arrive, so it did not take the offensive.</p>
<p>By the end of October, Yinchang's first batch of troops had crossed Xinyang and arrived at Wushengguan. The revolutionary army divided its forces to meet the enemy and won a great victory, chasing the Northern Army for more than 50 li and occupying Wushengguan, placing four large cannons at the entrance of the tunnel to block the north-south passage. Soon, Yinchang's main army arrived, and Feng Guozhang's reinforcements also arrived, so the revolutionary army could not support and retreated. On the 28th, Dazhimen and Liujiamiao in Hankou were recaptured by the Northern Army. After Hankou was lost, the revolutionary army retreated to Wuchang. The two armies were locked in a stalemate in Wuhan for a month. By the end of November, Hanyang was also captured by the Northern Army, and Wuchang was also in imminent danger.</p>
<p>The revolutionary army in Wuhan was suppressed by the Northern Army and suffered repeated defeats, but its power was expanding at any time, going up the Yangtze River and entering Sichuan. After the Sichuan Railway Protection Movement, the people's hearts were quite agitated, and most of the New Army in Sichuan inclined to the revolution, so the revolutionary army gained some new strength. The revolutionary party then sent troops south, and Changsha and Yueyang were successively captured. At the same time, they were active in the lower reaches of Changsha, conquering Jiujiang and occupying Anqing, going downstream east. Nanjing was a military stronghold, and Qing Governor Zhang Renjun had mobilized the Jiangfangying Battalion and stationed it in key positions after witnessing the Wuchang Uprising.</p>
<p>On November 8, the New Army failed to attack Yuhuatai and retreated to Zhenjiang. It happened that the Zhejiang reinforcements arrived, so they appointed Xu Shaozhen as the commander of the allied forces and counterattacked Nanjing. On the 23rd, they engaged Zhang Xun's troops and won a victory. On December 2, they occupied Yuhuatai and attacked from Taipingmen. Zhang Renjun and Zhang Xun fled, and Nanjing was restored.</p>
<p>The righteous banner in Wuchang was raised, and all provinces were shaken. The New Army launched uprisings one after another, and the governors of various provinces announced their independence one after another. On the second day of October, the revolutionary army occupied Jiujiang, and Nanchang was shaken. On the 31st, Wu Jiezhang, the commander of the New Army, declared independence, and Qing Governor Ma Rukun committed suicide. On the 24th, Anqing launched an uprising, and Taiyuan and Yunnan also launched uprisings on the 30th. Shanghai launched an uprising on November 3, led by Chen Ying'shi, first occupying the Zhabei Police Station and then the Manufacturing Bureau, and was also restored. The next day, the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangxi, Guizhou, Fujian, and Gansu also launched uprisings. There were also frequent rumors of the loss of Tianjin and Baoding. At that time, except for Henan Province, which was a war zone, the other eighteen provinces were all caught in the vortex of the revolutionary army.</p>
<p>Although the Qing government won the military victory in Wuhan, Nanjing was already in the hands of the revolutionary party. Even if Wuhan was restored, it would be of no avail. Moreover, the provinces were declaring independence one after another, the general trend was gone, and there was no way to reverse it. The Qing government then issued an edict blaming itself and dismissed the nobles, ordering Yuan Shikai to form a cabinet. The edict of blaming oneself stated: "I have no way to employ people, and lack the art of governance. I have used relatives and nobles in political places, and I have been separated from the Zhang emperors. I have used Ren in roads, and I have been far away from the people. I have promoted the New Deal, but officials and gentry have taken advantage of it for their own benefit. I have changed the old system, but the powerful people have taken it as a way to do as they please. I have taken too much wealth from the people, but I have not done one thing that benefits the people. I have issued decrees on justice many times, but there is not one person who abides by the law. I have allowed resentment to accumulate below, but I did not know it. Disaster is approaching, but I did not realize it." So, on the one hand, they negotiated peace and, on the other hand, they proceeded to organize a provisional government. On January 1 of the following year, the provisional government was established. On February 12, the Qing Emperor issued an abdication edict. The 1911 Revolution was completed.</p>
<p>The 1911 Revolution, from the Wuchang Uprising on October 10 to the Qing Emperor issuing the abdication edict, lasted only 126 days. The speed of events was unprecedented in the history of revolutions. This was due to the incompetence of the Qing officials and the corruption of the court, which led to the loss of the people's hearts. However, without the repeated and spectacular sacrifices, there would have been no such speed.</p>
<h3>Study of the Name of the Country and the National Seal</h3>
<p>During the abdication of the Qing Dynasty and the peace talks between the North and the South, there were many conflicting opinions on the official name of the new country after the revolution, such as "Republic of China", "Great Republic of China", "Great Han State", "Great Han Republic", etc. Later, the senators were established and formally designated the title "Republic of China" as law. Zhang Taiyan, a master of national studies and a senior revolutionary, strongly advocated using the name "Republic of China". At that time, he wrote an article "Explanation of the Republic of China" in the Min Bao, extensively citing many reasons.</p>
<p>Regarding the national seal, it is no longer possible to know who engraved the first national seal. However, the national seal used by today's National Government was engraved by the Father of the Nation when he was the Grand Marshal in Guangzhou. This national seal is made of old pit jade, with the words "Seal of the Republic of China". It is 2.7 inches high and 2.6 inches square. It was engraved by Lu, a famous jade craftsman at the time, who was paid 8,000 yuan. Tong Shenghai, the secretary of the Marshal's Mansion, was appointed as the Seal Official to manage the affairs.</p>

<h3>Record of the Recovery of Shanghai</h3>
<p>The success of the Xinhai Revolution hinged critically on the recovery of Shanghai.</p>
<p>If we were to examine the revolutionary history of the founding of the Republic of China, this principle would become very clear. The Wuchang Uprising took place on the evening of October 10, 1911. The recovery of Shanghai occurred on November 3 of the same year—twenty-four days after the Wuchang Uprising. Shanghai was originally the central hub for planning the revolution, as well as the linchpin of north-south sea and land transportation, and a vital passage for domestic and foreign communications. Apart from occupying extremely important positions in politics, culture, education, economy, finance, industry, and commerce, it was also a military hotspot. After the revolutionary army recovered Shanghai, they could obtain various conveniences in terms of military supplies and funding. Moreover, the recovery of Shanghai was launched before the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang took action. At this time, the three towns of Wuhan were re-occupied by the Qing army, so the headquarters commanding the revolution had already moved from Wuhan to Shanghai. Subsequently, the launch of volunteer armies in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the capture of Nanjing, and the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of China were all planned from Shanghai. Therefore, the recovery of Shanghai occupies an extremely glorious and important page in the history of the Xinhai Revolution.</p>
<p>Today, taking advantage of this Double Tenth Festival in the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China, we would like to present a systematic narrative of the entire process of Shanghai's recovery.</p>
<p>Leader – Chen Yingshi</p>
<p>When the Qing government’s policies were deteriorating day by day, and foreign troubles arose one after another, the tide of revolutionary thought was just beginning to sprout, and Shanghai was already the center for advocating revolution. This was because Shanghai had concessions where freedom of speech was relatively unrestricted. Patriotic societies run by figures such as Zhang Taiyan and Cai Yuanpei, and the Restoration Society run by Xu Xilin and Qiu Jin, were all advocating anti-Manchuism at the time, showing their sharp edges and having a great influence on the people, especially students and other intellectuals. Although there were considerable setbacks in the process, such as the "Subao" case, which was a rather famous major imprisonment in the history of the revolution.</p>
<p>These heroic and moving deeds would take a long time to tell, and we do not want to recount them again here. Here, we will only recount the events directly related to the recovery of Shanghai.</p>
<p>We should start by mentioning Chen Yingshi – he was the leader of the recovery of Shanghai and also a great figure in the founding history of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Chen Yingshi, whose given name was Qimei, was a native of Wuxing, Zhejiang. Six years before the founding of the Republic, he joined the Tongmenghui in Tokyo and later entered the Dongbin School to study military science. Three years before the founding of the Republic, he returned to China from Japan and began to work on party affairs in Shanghai. He once gathered comrades to found the "China Daily" and the "Minsheng Congbao" in Shanghai as revolutionary organs of speech. He also established a secret office in Defuli, Mahe Road. Revolutionary comrades from Jiangsu and Zhejiang who came to Shanghai mostly stayed there to connect with each other.</p>
<p>The following year, the party affairs flourished. Chen convened comrades from Jiangsu and Zhejiang at the office to discuss major plans. Unexpectedly, Liu Guanghan, a revolutionary party member present, betrayed everyone by secretly informing Qing official Duanfang, who notified the concession authorities and searched the Defuli office. Chen escaped because he was out. Chu Fucheng, Zhou Danyu, and others escaped disguised as workers. Only Zhang Gong was arrested by the authorities and imprisoned in Nanjing Prison. Due to this incident, the major plans of Jiangsu and Zhejiang were interrupted.</p>
<p>Central China Alliance</p>
<p>In June 1910, the year before the Xinhai Revolution, comrades of the Tongmenghui in Japan gathered to discuss the expansion of revolutionary work. Song Jiaoren suggested organizing the "Central China Alliance" to promote revolutionary work in the provinces along the Yangtze River. Song then came to Shanghai to plan and proceed with comrades such as Chen Yingshi. By mid-February of the following year (the year of Xinhai), the "Central China Alliance" gradually became organized. On the sixth day of the sixth lunar month of the intercalary month, the inaugural meeting of the "Central China Alliance" was held at the Zeng Hall in Huzhou. A total of thirty-three comrades attended, and Song Jiaoren, Chen Yingshi, Tan Renfeng, and others were publicly elected to preside over party affairs. It was decided that the eight provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and Shaanxi would jointly launch uprisings, with each province proceeding separately.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the "Central China Alliance," the key hub was Shanghai. In mid-September of that year, military comrades from Hubei Province ordered Ju Zheng and others to go to Shanghai to discuss the procurement of hand-drawn drawings and other military supplies, and planned to invite Song Jiaoren, Huang Xing, and others to go to Hankou to take charge of everything. Ju Zheng and others arrived in Shanghai and held a meeting at Chen Yingshi's secret office on Mahe Road, deciding to launch uprisings in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Wuhan simultaneously, and sent personnel to Hong Kong to invite Huang Keqiang to Hankou to preside over the events. However, before the arrangements were completed, revolutionary comrades in Hubei Province, unable to wait any longer, raised their flags in Wuchang – which was the famous Wuchang Uprising of today thirty-six years ago. Thus, Huang Keqiang, Song Jiaoren, Ju Zheng, and others rushed from Shanghai to Hubei to jointly manage military affairs. Chen Yingshi and others stayed in Shanghai to contact defense forces in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Hangzhou to launch uprisings in response.</p>
<p>"September 13" Uprising</p>
<p>After the Wuchang Uprising, the people of Shanghai were extremely excited. The following short story can illustrate the sentiment of the people at that time:</p>
<p>Because people in Shanghai were concerned about the actions of the Wuchang rebel army, our newspaper specially issued an afternoon edition at that time to report the news about the revolutionary uprising to readers as soon as possible. Once, the newspaper received a telegram from a reporter reporting that Feng Guozhang had retaken Hanyang from Hankou. This was, of course, unfavorable news for the people's army and was included in the afternoon edition. Unexpectedly, just as the news vendors were shouting and selling it outside the newspaper office, a large group of righteous people swarmed into the newspaper office, accusing them of spreading rumors. They were happy when the people's army won, and angry when the people's army lost, even blaming the newspaper office. Such popular sentiment was already a sign of the revolution's success.</p>
<p>The revolutionaries in Shanghai at this time believed that the time was ripe and prepared for an uprising. On the one hand, the Shanghai Merchant Corps, organized by Shanghai merchants themselves, also rose up in response and maintained close contact with the people's army. On the eleventh day of the ninth lunar month (November 1), the Merchant Corps held a grand review at Nine-Acre Field, with more than two thousand people participating. The presidents of the various merchant corps held a meeting at the Nanshi Fire Brigade, chaired by Li Pingshu (whose bronze statue is now built in the Lake Heart Pavilion of the City God Temple for admiration). It was agreed that if the bell tower of the Fire Brigade rang, first nine times, then thirteen times, the Merchant Corps would be dispatched in sections for defense, implicitly meaning responding to the revolution on the thirteenth day of the ninth month. On the evening of the 12th, Shanghai Taoist Liu Xiangsun had already obtained this information and was so anxious that he didn't know what to do, and quickly telegraphed Nanjing Governor's Office, reporting the Shanghai Revolutionary Party uprising and the complete defection of the Merchant Corps. So at dawn on the 13th, Nanjing Governor's Office ordered the Nanjing and Songjiang troops to advance directly to Shanghai, and ordered "Regardless of the people's army or the Merchant Corps, those captured will be executed immediately."</p>
<p>At this time, the people's army and the Merchant Corps were in a situation where "the arrow was on the string and had to be fired." In the afternoon, the Zhabei police took the lead in launching the uprising. At 5 o'clock, the people's army, with white cloth wrapped around their arms, in military attire, and carrying guns, marched into the city, posted announcements to reassure the people, and at 10 o'clock at night, attacked the Daoxian Office. Shanghai Taoist Liu Xiangsun had already fled into the concession, and County Magistrate Tian Farong had also left. White flags were hung everywhere in the city, and shops operated as usual. At this moment, the Fire Brigade alarm bell rang loudly, and the Merchant Corps knew that the situation had matured, and the entire body went out to defend, and the Shanghai County town was so peacefully and without bloodshed, entered into the hands of the people's army.</p>
<p>At the same time, Chen Yingshi, because he had already successfully contacted a part of the defense army of the manufacturing bureau, led the daredevil team of the people's army to attack. Unexpectedly, another part of the defense army in the bureau came out to firmly resist. Chen ordered to stop the attack temporarily, and personally ran into the manufacturing bureau to give speeches and persuade the resisting soldiers. Who knew he was captured and locked to a pillar with iron chains. The people's army immediately began a fierce attack, and the Merchant Corps also sent two teams of merchants to assist, and sent people into the bureau to persuade the defense forces to act as internal agents. As expected, internal agents privately unloaded the cannon door and sent it out. The attack reached Daming and finally occupied the entire bureau, rescuing Chen Yingshi from danger; and Shanghai was completely recovered.</p>
<p>Bloody Battle of the Manufacturing Bureau</p>
<p>Regarding the attack on the manufacturing bureau, our newspaper at that time had extremely detailed records. Here is an excerpt from our newspaper news on September 14 of the Xinhai year:</p>
<p>Special events in this port: Yesterday at 5 o'clock, the revolutionary army obtained the Shanghai military camp, attacked the manufacturing bureau at 5:15, and occupied Shanghai city at 8 o'clock. The people were not disturbed at all. Earlier, at 3 o'clock, more than two hundred Republic soldiers lined up and passed through the Shanghai military camp. The soldiers on both sides raised their hands to their foreheads as a salute. Before long, the Republic army flag was raised in the camp. "After the Republic army arrived at the manufacturing bureau, there were 120 daredevils who rushed in first, wearing white uniforms with red money inlaid on the sleeves, without military weapons, and attacked barehanded. First, the leader of the daredevils set off a bomb inside the door, which was very loud. Then the people's army gave speeches to the crowd, saying that they were all compatriots and would not harm them. It is hoped that they will not refuse, and that Zhang has agreed to give it up, etc. However, the artillery battalion and patrol police stationed in the bureau came out to resist and fired a volley of guns. The people's army was unprepared and suffered eight gunshots. The leader of the daredevils injured his arm when releasing the bomb and has been sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. It is heard that many defense soldiers were also injured. At this time, the people's army knew that it could not be reasoned, so they used their death power to attack and surrounded the bureau. Then retreated to Wangdao Bridge and planned to attack slowly." The record in our newspaper on the 14th can only go this far due to time constraints. The next morning, the front page of our newspaper had a continuation of the attack on the manufacturing bureau;</p>
<p>"... At dawn, the people's army returned to the manufacturing bureau, with more than 200 daredevils and hundreds of Shanghai military camp soldiers, divided into two teams, attacking the front and rear doors. Those attacking the front door were forced to the second door. The soldiers guarding the building fired guns from the first floor, and bullets fell like rain. The people's army went forward bravely and also fired guns upwards to resist. About two hours. The people's army intended not to hurt people, so they did not bring many bullets. At this time, the bullets were running out, but the bureau soldiers continued to fire their guns. The daredevils rushed to the Shanghai military camp and dragged two Gatling cannons, fired more than ten rounds, and one bullet was blasted towards the roof. The bureau soldiers still refused to retreat, and the people's army said that they would take kerosene to burn the building, so the bureau soldiers began to fear and fled. At that time, the people's army attacking the back door could not enter because there was no way in. The Shanghai military camp fired a volley of guns and blasted a hole in the back wall, and then entered. The daredevils first threw bombs and the Shanghai military camp soldiers fired guns afterwards, which was extremely brave. The bureau soldiers saw that the attack was coming from both sides, and knew that they could not resist, so they surrendered to the army. It is heard that the military supplies in the bureau are extremely sufficient, and the people's army is very happy. ..."</p>
<p>In this bloody battle, our newspaper also commented on the "Battle of the Shanghai South Manufacturing Bureau" in the editorial on the 15th, deeply praising the revolutionary party's selfless spirit.</p>
<p>In fact, this bloody battle fully demonstrated the courage and spirit of the revolutionaries. When the people's army was running out of bullets and dying, but everyone had no intention of retreating, they finally succeeded with the last five minutes of perseverance. How could it be a fluke? A young student who participated in the revolution had been shot in the head, his face was covered in blood, but he still disregarded himself, tore off his clothes to bandage the wound, carried a gun and shouted, and rushed forward. How could this spirit be matched by even a fraction by the current generation of people who are greedy for life and afraid of death!</p>
<p>After the Recovery</p>
<p>The situation of the revolutionary army entering Shanghai has been mentioned roughly above, and here we will record it in more detail:</p>
<p>I might as well copy the old newspaper again: —— (our newspaper on September 14 of the Xinhai year)</p>
<p>"Yesterday at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, there were forty or fifty Republic soldiers, in military uniform and with swords, lined up and entered Xiaodongmen, and hung an announcement on the telegraph poles at each city gate and Changsheng Bridge, and the patrol police did not dare to stop them. The text is recorded below: According to the Wuchang Uprising, all compatriots are of one mind. Wherever my flag points, everyone is welcome to welcome them. The people of all provinces and cities have recovered and have never harmed Anning. Shanghai is a giant port in the southeast, famous in the trading world. Once the army gathers, the damage will inevitably be light. Now, by order of the military government, I, together with people from all walks of life, have pledged allegiance to the enemy's heart and compassion. I hope that all dear compatriots will continue to live and work in peace and stability, and do not take advantage of this opportunity to infringe on the lives and property of foreigners. In an instant, the Republic of China will be established, and everyone will share peace.</p>
<p>At 8 o'clock in the evening, another team of the Republic army, about twenty people, carrying guns, lined up and entered the city, holding red and white flags of the Republic army, and posted announcements in all directions. White flags and military flags were hung on the city gates. There was no resistance in the city at the time, so the order was very quiet, and the shops in the city still traded as usual without any disturbance, and the city of Shanghai was "lost"! (omitted)</p>
<p>On the sixteenth day of the ninth lunar month (November 6) – the third day after the recovery, the comrades of the uprising held a meeting in the Haifang Hall in Xiaodongmen to organize the Shanghai Military Government, and elected Chen Yingshi as the Military Governor of Shanghai. At that time, the Yue Army Jizi Camp stationed in Wusong had also begun to revolt. On the 17th, Chen Yingshi appointed Wu Tingfang as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Shen Maozhao as the Minister of Finance. On the 18th, the Minister of Civil Affairs appointed a civil affairs chief of Shanghai County, Huang Qingchao as the judicial chief of Shanghai County, Mo Xilun as the mayor, and Wei Sougui as the deputy mayor, and changed the original "City Self-Government Office" to "City Hall". At the same time, the Shanghai Military Governor's Office also appointed Li Xianmo as the Commander of the Shanghai Water and Land Army. The Shanghai Military Governor's Office then became the highest military and political authority of the Shanghai Revolution.</p>
<p>After the recovery of Shanghai, righteous armies in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang also launched uprisings one after another. On the fifteenth day of the ninth lunar month, the Suzhou People's Army launched an uprising; on the twenty-first day, Zhenjiang launched an uprising, and the naval warships followed suit; on the twenty-second day, the Jiangyin Fort expressed unified action; on the twenty-fifth day, the Shanghai Army attacked Nanjing; on the twenty-sixth day, the Zhejiang People's Army responded and launched a joint attack; on the fifth day of the tenth lunar month, the armies of Suzhou, Hangzhou, Shanghai, and Zhenjiang joined forces to attack Nanjing, and on the twelfth day, Nanjing was captured. The Qing government was in a bad position and had to yield and sue for peace.</p>
<p>Having written this, the whole story of Shanghai's recovery has been roughly narrated, and this "Record of the Recovery of Shanghai" can also be concluded. However, we would also like to specially mention Chen Yingshi, the Military Governor of Shanghai who recovered Shanghai, and Li Pingshu, the leader of the Shanghai Merchant Corps, and the members of the Merchant Corps who participated in the recovery and made outstanding contributions.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Military Governor's Office was abolished in July of the first year of the Republic of China due to Chen Yingshi's resignation. At that time, Yuan Shikai had become the Provisional President, and the general situation was irreversible. In the second year of the Republic of China, the anti-Yuan army rose up. On July 18 of that year, Chen established the headquarters of the anti-Yuan army in Shanghai in Nanshi, but unfortunately failed. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor. On May 18 of the following year, Chen Yingshi was assassinated in Shanghai by Yuan Shikai's henchmen.</p>
<p>After the members of the Shanghai Merchant Corps recovered their hometown, they also actively participated in several battles in Jiangnan afterwards. When the founding father took office in Nanjing, the Merchant Corps served as the Imperial Guard. However, after Yuan Shikai came to power, the entire group had to be disbanded.</p>
<p>But, although those who died have died, and those who dispersed have dispersed, their merits and their spirit should be forever engraved in the hearts of every Shanghainese.</p>
<p>Today, in this festive day of national jubilation, we are excited to remember the revolutionary giants who recovered Shanghai, and to remember the heroic sacrifices of countless martyrs thirty-six years ago! As a Shanghainese, how should we inherit the spirit of our predecessors and contribute to our hometown?</p>

<h3>Eighty Years of Chinese Shipping (Continued from Page Seventeen)</h3>
<p>Loss of Shipping Rights and Its Impact Before the War</p>
<p>The loss of our country's shipping rights before the Anti-Japanese War began with the Sino-British Treaty of Nanjing in the 22nd year of Daoguang (1842) of the Late Qing Dynasty, in which the second clause stated: "British people are allowed to bring their families and reside in the five coastal ports of Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Ningbo, and Shanghai, and trade without obstruction," and the fourth clause of the supplementary treaty to the Sino-British Trade Regulations in the 23rd year of Daoguang (1843): "British merchants are only allowed to trade in our country." The Late Qing government was not aware of the importance of shipping rights. At that time, there were no restrictions on British people traveling back and forth, and they were allowed to trade, and it was inevitable that they would carry both passengers and goods. Although there were no formal regulations on coastal trade, in fact, our country's laissez-faire policy was extremely beneficial to these British merchants. Therefore, since the conclusion of the Treaty of Nanjing, our country's coastal trade has fallen into the hands of Westerners.</p>
<p>The loss of shipping rights on the Yangtze River began in the eighth year of Xianfeng (1858). The tenth clause of the Sino-British Supplementary Treaty stipulated: "British merchants can trade in the Yangtze River area," and in the tenth year of Xianfeng (1861), there were also Yangtze River trade regulations. At that time, the Late Qing government had in fact allowed foreign merchants to travel back and forth to various ports along the Yangtze River to transport native goods. From then on, British merchant ships filled the river, and the shipping rights of the Yangtze River were lost from then on!</p>
<p>With the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Shimonoseki in the 21st year of Guangxu (1895), Japanese ships were allowed to sail to Shashi, Chongqing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, and they were allowed to carry passengers and load goods. Foreign ships thus sailed into our country's inland ports. Two years later, the Sino-British Burma Treaty allowed British ships to go to various ports in South China - Xijiang, Wuzhou, and Guangzhou to berth, and everything was handled in the same way as the Yangtze River trade regulations. By the 28th year of Guangxu (1902), foreign ships' navigation rights had reached all parts of our country's coast, South China, and the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and they were expanding day by day. By the 29th year of Guangxu (1903), the Sino-Japanese Trade and Navigation Supplementary Treaty allowed Japanese ships to travel to the three northeastern provinces and the inland ports of Yantai, in addition to sailing to various ports along the Yangtze River. The power of foreign ships extended from central and southern China to the northeastern part of our country.</p>
<p>Before the conclusion of the above-mentioned unequal treaties; foreigners knew that the Late Qing government was extremely timid, only paying attention to taxes and not knowing what shipping rights were, and many officials even thought that foreign ships would help our country develop its commerce. All of this contributed to foreign merchants first trying to encroach and creating a fait accompli. Over time, mistakes accumulated and became facts. When there was an opportunity - such as when our country was defeated by a foreign country, they would take the opportunity to force our country to sign a treaty and become a legitimate right. Therefore, since the establishment of the Republic of China, our country's shipping industry has never prospered, and international trade is even more unbearable. Westerners purchased our native goods back to their countries and shipped their manufactured products to dump them. China has become a hunting ground for all countries in the world; our country's sovereignty, national defense, transportation, and economy have all been infringed upon. If it were not for this Anti-Japanese War, China today would probably have become India ten years ago!</p>
<p>Shipping During the War of Resistance</p>
<p>Our country's weakness has long been known to its strong neighbor, Japan. After the September 18th Incident, the Japanese enemy even wanted to use its entire land, sea, and air force to force our country to perish. Our country tolerated again and again and had to make good preparations and fight with them. In terms of shipping, the government first started with the reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. In October of the 21st year, it took over the company as a state-owned enterprise. In May of the following year, it used 360,000 pounds of the British Boxer Indemnity to order four ocean-going ships and three river ships. In June of the 23rd year, it promulgated the Ship Crew Qualification Regulations, and then trained a large number of personnel and sent them to ships with more than 1,000 tons owned by state-owned and private companies to study shipping affairs. Fuel was also stored in various parts of the Yangtze River to prepare for emergencies. Sichuan Province has a dangerous terrain and crisscrossing waterways, and it was planned to be the center of the Anti-Japanese War. The Ministry of Transportation ordered the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Minsheng Company, and others to rush to build shallow-water wheels, etc., to prepare for sailing on the Sichuan River. Unfortunately, the construction of the shallow-water wheels built by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was not completed, and the Shanghai Battle had already begun!</p>
<p>On the eve of the Anti-Japanese War, our country only had 600,000 tons of ships. Moreover, with the weak naval power, it could not protect transportation, so it had to try to preserve it to avoid benefiting the enemy and to maintain transportation to the rear. In August of the 26th year - the situation between China and Japan deteriorated. The Ministry of Transportation secretly telegraphed various shipping companies to quickly ship all ocean-going ships into the Yangtze River. Those that could not be shipped into the river went to Hong Kong. After the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle, except for 14 ocean-going ships that were captured by the enemy because they could not escape, the rest were preserved. When the situation in Wuhan became tense, the Hankou Shipping Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, together with military transportation agencies, urged the ships to withdraw to the west again. A total of 208 ships retreated to Yichang, 66 to Changsha, and 16 to Changde. Those not in the above withdrawal figures temporarily responded by sinking themselves in the port to block the tools - in the early seven years of the Anti-Japanese War, the number of ships that completed this task reached 87, weighing 110,000 tons. Shipping companies across the country were aware of the righteousness, regardless of the losses, and responded generously. This is the main reason why the Japanese pirate fleet could not go west. The withdrawn ships were responsible for transporting materials. Because it was urgent, the detailed quantities were not statistically recorded. Only the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company transported 88,000 tons of public goods and 190,000 tons of commercial goods from August 14 of the 26th year to the end of the 28th year. The Minsheng Company transported more than 200,000 tons of military equipment and public goods from August of the 26th year to the end of the 29th year. The water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River was shallow, and the employees of various shipping companies worked hard in the midst of hardships, and their spirit was extremely admirable.</p>
<p>In this Anti-Japanese War, in addition to the government requisitioning ships to block waterways as passive resistance, the losses due to other reasons are listed below. (See: Simple Table of Ship Tonnage Lost During the Anti-Japanese War)</p>
<p>Simple Table of Number of Ships Lost During the Anti-Japanese War</p>
<p>Military Requisition for Blockage 119,986.50 tons</p>
<p>Bombed and Destroyed During Military and Public Transportation 15,891.00 tons</p>
<p>Captured by the Enemy 111,006.00 tons</p>
<p>Bombed and Sunk by the Enemy 49,357.74 tons</p>
<p>Total 296,241.24 tons</p>
<p>In summary, our country had no more than 600,000 tons of ships on the eve of the Anti-Japanese War. And those directly damaged by the Anti-Japanese War were nearly 300,000 tons, which has reached half. Among them, the losses due to military requisition for blockage work have been allocated with huge sums of money by our government, and special commissioners have been assigned to go to the United States to order new ships to compensate the damaged shipping companies.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Public Works in the Past Eighty Years</h3>
<p>— Zhao Zengjue</p>
<p>1.  Introduction: Public utilities are public services closely related to people's daily lives. Therefore, railways, highways, shipping, post and telecommunications, etc., all fall within the scope of public utilities. However, because they have a national scope, they are all under state management. Modern commonly known public utilities mostly refer to the narrow sense, that is, local water supply, electricity, gas, telephone, land transportation, wharf warehouses, street lamp standards, etc., all belong to it.</p>
<p>The public utilities of Shanghai Municipality began in the Tongzhi period of the late Qing Dynasty. The earliest operators were British and French merchants, followed by American merchants. Chinese people quickly caught up and also started businesses in the Guangxu period, with large-scale preparations surpassing all major cities in the country. A chronological table is compiled below according to the order of their initial establishment:</p>
<p>Tongzhi 5th year of the Qing Dynasty (1866): The British Shanghai Gas Company was established, marking the beginning of gas lights and gas stoves in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Tongzhi 12th year of the Qing Dynasty (1873): A Frenchman named Menard imported a rickshaw from Japan. On the seventh day of the second month of Tongzhi 13th year (March 24, 1874), the French Concession Public Works Bureau issued the first rickshaw license, marking the beginning of rickshaws in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Guangxu 7th year of the Qing Dynasty (1881): The Great Northern Telegraph Company also operated telephone services in the concessions, marking the beginning of telephone service in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Guangxu 8th year of the Qing Dynasty (1882): The British Shanghai Waterworks Company was established, marking the beginning of tap water in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In the same year, the Western Shanghai Electric Company (the predecessor of the current Shanghai Electric Power Company) was established, marking the beginning of electric lights in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Guangxu 16th year of the Qing Dynasty (1890): The Public Concession began to use incandescent electric lights as street lamps, marking the beginning of electric street lamps in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Guangxu 23rd year of the Qing Dynasty (1897): The Shanghai Nanshi Road Works Rehabilitation Bureau prepared for electric lights, marking the beginning of electric lights in Shanghai Nanshi.</p>
<p>Guangxu 27th year of the Qing Dynasty (1901): A Hungarian named Leinz imported two automobiles, marking the beginning of automobiles in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Guangxu 28th year of the Qing Dynasty (1902): The Inland Waterworks Company opened, marking the beginning of tap water in Shanghai Nanshi.</p>
<p>In the same year, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau was established, marking the beginning of telephone service in urban Shanghai.</p>
<p>Guangxu 33rd year of the Qing Dynasty (1907): The Inland Electric Light Company (the predecessor of the current Chinese Electric Company) was established.</p>
<p>In the same year, the French Tramway and Electric Light Company was established, also operating water supply and public transportation, marking the beginning of water, electricity, and transportation in the French Concession of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Guangxu 34th year of the Qing Dynasty (1908): British and French merchants successively opened streetcar services, marking the beginning of trams in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Xuantong 2nd year of the Qing Dynasty (1908): The Pudong Embankment Works Rehabilitation Bureau opened the Pudong River Ferry, marking the beginning of ferries in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Republic of China 2nd year (1913): The Chinese Tramway Company opened, marking the beginning of trams in Shanghai Nanshi.</p>
<p>Republic of China 3rd year (1914): The British Shanghai Tramway Company opened trolleybus service, marking the beginning of trolleybuses in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Republic of China 13th year (1924): The British Shanghai Bus Company and the Chinese Bus Company successively opened, marking the beginning of buses in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Republic of China 26th year (1937): The city-run Pudong Waterworks Plant opened, marking the beginning of tap water in Shanghai Pudong.</p>
<p>As for the administrative agencies that supervise public utilities, in the past, it was the Public Works Bureau in the Public Concession and the Board of Directors in the French Concession. In the urban area, it was initially the Engineering Patrol Donation Bureau, and later the Municipal Government, but they were all concurrent in nature, with no specialized agency established at the beginning. It was not until the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government in the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927) that a Public Utilities Bureau was set up and its responsibilities were defined, marking the beginning of Shanghai having an administrative agency in charge of public utilities. At that time, with the existence of the concessions, the Public Utilities Bureau exercised its powers only within the urban area, with a narrow scope and relatively simple affairs. Now, with the recovery of the concessions and the unification of administration, the Public Utilities Bureau is in charge of all public utilities in the city, and all Chinese and foreign merchants are under its supervision and guidance. The affairs are complicated and the responsibilities are heavy, which cannot be compared with the past.</p>
<p>During the July 7th Anti-Japanese War, when Shanghai fell, Shanghai's various public utilities were severely damaged and suffered heavy losses. In the autumn of the 34th year, the Anti-Japanese War was won, the concessions were recovered, and the Public Utilities Bureau, along with the Municipal Government, was re-established in this land, taking over the reorganization, planning the restoration, and advancing in different ways. In the past two years, Shanghai's various public utilities have gradually returned to their original state, and some have even surpassed pre-war records. They are listed and reported separately below:</p>
<p>2.  Water Supply</p>
<p>Evolution</p>
<p>In the eighth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty (1882), the British Shanghai Waterworks Company opened, supplying foreigners living in Shanghai, which was the beginning of Shanghai's water supply business. In the 22nd year of Guangxu (1896), the French Concession Board of Directors established its own waterworks. In the 32nd year of Guangxu (1906), the Board of Directors transferred the factory and its business rights to the French Tramway and Electric Light Company, and divided the business area with the Shanghai Waterworks Company, with the Yangjingbang as the boundary. At this point, the first and second special zones each had a waterworks. As for the waterworks operated by the Chinese, there were three in total. One was the Shanghai Inland Waterworks Company. In the 22nd year of Guangxu, Cao and others reported to the circuit intendant Liu Xiang to prepare for the establishment. The next year, the Hua Factory was built in Bansong Garden, and it was completed and put into operation in the 28th year of Guangxu (1902). The second was the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. In the late Qing Dynasty, the British Shanghai Waterworks Company laid water pipes beyond the boundary. The Governor-General of Liangjiang, Zhang Renjun, issued a warrant to the Shanghai Daoyin to borrow official funds to organize the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to protect sovereignty. It immediately built a factory in Tanziwan (now the end of Hengfeng Road). It was established in September of the 3rd year of Xuantong (October 1909). It was once taken over by the province, and in the 13th year of the Republic of China (1924), it was changed to a commercial operation. A new factory was built at the junction of Hugang River and Jiangsong Bridge, and it was fully completed in the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), with the old Tanzi factory as a water distribution plant. The third is the Pudong Waterworks. The Pudong districts "have never had any water supply facilities. The Shanghai Municipal Government, in view of the increasing number of residents in Pudong and the urgent need for water, ordered the Public Utilities Bureau to prepare for the establishment. However, due to insufficient funding, Song Neng actively proceeded. In October of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), the Municipal Government ordered the Xingye Trust Company to prepare for the establishment. In September of the 24th year (1935), the factory was built at the exit of Youlong Road in Pudong. In June of the 26th year (1937), the project was completed and water supply began.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, "except for the French Concession Waterworks Company, the remaining Shanghai waterworks were merged and operated by the Shanghai Waterway Branch of the China Water and Electricity Company. In September of the 34th year, the Public Utilities Bureau was ordered to take over. Except for the Pudong Waterworks, which was continued to be operated by the Public Utilities Bureau, the rest were returned to their original owners.</p>
<p>Restoration Status</p>
<p>During the enemy occupation period, the water supply facilities were allowed to deteriorate, the sand in the water pools was not replaced for many years, and the disinfection products were deliberately reduced. Not only was the water quality turbid, but the leakage also reached more than 60% due to the damaged water pipes, which greatly affected the citizens' use. The companies were urged to repair the water pipes, and the leakage gradually decreased to about 30%. At the same time, the Health Bureau and the waterworks repeatedly discussed and formulated the "Shanghai Drinking Water Cleanliness Standard." The main points were that the number of bacteria in each cubic centimeter (CC) of water should not exceed 100, and the number of coliform bacteria in each liter should not exceed 10. The sum of temporary hardness and permanent hardness should not exceed 300. In terms of total water output, the average daily water output was about 330,000 cubic meters at the time of takeover. By July of the 36th year, it was more than 571,301 cubic meters, which had surpassed the highest pre-war record of more than 452,000 cubic meters of water supply per day.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, only the Hongqiao area felt that the water volume and water pressure were insufficient, causing panic. In order to fundamentally solve the problem, the Public Utilities Bureau planned to establish the Hongqiao Waterworks Company, but the project was difficult and costly, and could not be accomplished overnight. In order to meet the current urgent needs, the Hongqiao water supply emergency project was launched. In addition to ordering the British Shanghai Waterworks Company to restore the west end of Zhongshan Park and the free-flowing wells of the Jiaozhou Road water pumping station, in order to provide water for the residents east of Gubei Road, north of Xianxia Zhongzheng West Road, a water pool with a capacity of 2,000 cubic meters was built on Zhongzheng West Road, and three water pumping machines were installed to transfer 3,000 cubic meters of water from the Shanghai Waterworks Company to the residents west of Huashan Road, north of Chahar Road, east of Kaixuan Road, and south of Zhongzheng West Road. However, the area from the intersection of Jiangsu Road and Zhongshan Road south along Huashan Road to Gubei Road cannot be remedied without drilling new artesian wells. After surveying, three 8-inch diameter artesian wells were drilled at the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Yili Road, the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Linsen West Road, and the intersection of Huashan Road and Linsen West Road, with a total daily water output of 2,400 cubic meters. After the completion of the entire Hongqiao emergency project, the daily water supply can be supplemented by 11,000 cubic meters, which can be increased by about 50% based on the current daily water supply of 21,000 cubic meters, which is enough to supply water for 60,000 people, and the water shortage can be alleviated.</p>
<p>In order to cooperate with the future prosperity of Pudong, the Pudong Waterworks must expand its equipment to meet the needs. Under the guidance of the Public Utilities Bureau, the factory has implemented the expansion of water pipes. The first phase of the project plans to extend the existing main pipe from No. 6 Bridge on Pudong Road to Minsheng Road Lanyan Chimney Pier via 18 Jian Town. The second step is to extend it to Yangjing Town. For the water supply facilities at the pier, the following locations are being completed: China Merchants Bureau Pier Nos. 5, 7, 8, 9, Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs No. 3 Warehouse, Gonghexing East and West Warehouses, Taikoo Pudong Warehouse, and Huatong Warehouse. In addition, in order to handle the water supply for ships in the river, a water supply ship has been purchased and will be completed soon, and a contract can be signed with various shipping companies to supply water.</p>
<p>3.  Electricity</p>
<p>Evolution</p>
<p>Shanghai's electricity business began with the Western Shanghai Electric Company (now the American Shanghai Electric Power Company), which opened in the eighth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty (1882). Following this, the French Tramway and Electric Light Company and the Chinese-operated Inland Electric Light Company were both established in the 33rd year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty (1907). In the 3rd year of Xuantong (1909), the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company was established. In the 7th year of the Republic of China (1918), the Inland Electric Light Company and the Chinese Tramway Company merged to form the Chinese Electric Company. Soon after, the Baoming, Pudong, Zhenru, and Xianghua power plants were also established successively. From the 20th to the 24th year of the Republic of China, in order to solve the problem of power supply to the Shanghai Hongqiao boundary road, the Shanghai Municipal Government negotiated with the American Shanghai Electric Power Company several times. On January 4th of the 24th year of the Republic of China, an agreement was signed to establish the Shanghai Hongqiao Electric Power Co., Ltd., with Chinese capital accounting for 49% of the shares, and the rest belonging to the Shanghai Electric Power Company.</p>
<p>During the occupation period, except for the French Electric Light Company, the Shanghai Hongqiao, Chinese, Zhabei, Pudong, and other electric companies were forcibly merged by the Shanghai Electric Branch of the enemy's China Water and Electricity Company. After the victory, the Zhenru and Xianghua power plants were destroyed during the war and no longer exist. The rest were taken over by the Public Utilities Bureau and handed over to the original owners for continued operation.</p>
<p>Restoration Overview</p>
<p>The electrical companies suffered heavy losses due to the enemy's long-term occupation. In particular, the power generation equipment of the Zhabei, Chinese, and Pudong electrical companies was completely dismantled, and they could only purchase electricity from the Shanghai Electric Power Company for resale. The total installed capacity of Shanghai's power plants before the war was 260,000 kilowatts. At the beginning of the takeover, the city's power generation was only 124,000 kilowatts, less than half of the pre-war capacity. The power supply was extremely tight, and the supply could not meet the demand, causing great pain to the citizens. After the Public Utilities Bureau coordinated the takeover, it supervised the companies to repair the damaged machines and ordered new machines, moving forward in different ways. By the end of the 34th year, the city's power generation had increased to 141,000 kilowatts. In May of the 35th year, the Shanghai Power Supply Review Committee was organized to determine the priority of power supply according to the urgency of use, so as to adjust the load time of users of various electrical companies and balance the load factor. By July of the 36th year, it had increased to 182,000 kilowatts, but the demand from users was increasing day by day, and the demand for electricity from factories was particularly urgent, and it was still insufficient to meet the supply, so efforts were made to supervise the increase of equipment. The 21,500 kilowatt generator that the Shanghai Electric Power Company sent to the United States for repair was soon shipped back and installed. In addition, a 15,000 kilowatt high-voltage generator that was newly added before the war and not used was repaired and put into formal power generation. The No. 7 generator of the French Tramway and Electric Light Company, which was damaged, was repaired and generated 3,000 kilowatts. A new 3,600 kilowatt generator was also installed and put into power generation. In addition to generating 9,500 kilowatts on its own, the Zhabei Electric Company also obtained 1,500 kilowatts from the Wusong Wing On Textile Factory. The Pudong Electric Company ordered a set of 2,500 kilowatt steam turbine generator equipment from the British Mauffer Electric Factory, which has been installed and put into power generation. Recently, it has applied to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for a set of 800 kilowatt diesel power generation equipment, which will soon be transported to Shanghai for installation. In addition, after the Chinese Electric Company leased the generator of the Shanghai Cement Company, it has generated 700 kilowatts, and has also applied to the Executive Yuan for the purchase of two new 2,000 kilowatt machines, and has paid half of the payment. After delivery, they can be installed. In summary, the above-mentioned increase in power generation is about 50,000 kilowatts. The table below shows the power supplied to the city and the industrial power from the time of takeover to July of the 36th year: (Note) The number of electricity sales in the city does not include the amount of electricity sold by the same industry.</p>
<p>Although the power supply has increased slightly, the electricity shortage has not been resolved. The Public Utilities Bureau originally planned a rationalization plan for Shanghai's electricity, and the Shanghai "Council passed a proposal in the 36th year to "organize an electrical company." The Public Utilities Bureau immediately summoned the American electrical companies several times to discuss the matter. A consistent principle was passed, and the detailed methods and contracts are being negotiated. The date of establishment should not be far away. On the central side, after the Shanghai Municipal Government's request, it has agreed to allocate a set of 53,000 kilowatt generators from the Japanese compensation generators to be received by the United Electrical Company. In the near future, the city's electricity shortage will hopefully improve.</p>

<h3>Eighty Years of Chinese Shipping (Continued from page twenty)</h3>
<p>The shipping situation from the victory to the present</p>
<p>The United Kingdom and the United States of America, in appreciation of the heroic resistance and arduous struggle of our government and people, re-signed a new treaty of equality with our country on January 10 of the seventh year of the Anti-Japanese War. The century-old shackles were lifted at once. The treaty includes shipping rights, such as coastal trade rights, inland navigation rights, pilotage rights, etc., which were completely recovered, which is truly gratifying.</p>
<p>In September of the 34th year, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Ministry of Communications established special commissioners' offices in Beijing-Shanghai, Wuhan, Tianjin, and Guangdong, each with shipping administration receiving commissioners, and received a total of 2,751 ships from the Japanese enemy, with a total tonnage of 251,288 tons (of which 20 were over 1,000 tons, 23 were from 501 tons to 1,000 tons, and the rest were mostly small steamers, and many were barges, most of which had to be repaired before they could be used).</p>
<p>Restoration and transportation: Water transport occupies a major position. Under the circumstances of ship shortage, those in charge have made the greatest efforts. From September 16 of the 34th year to the end of January of the 35th year, the waterways transported 11,760 government personnel, 5,100 family members, 19,237 tons of public and commercial goods, 38,600 troops, and 13,535 tons of military supplies (the above figures refer to those transported eastward from Chongqing, and others transported from Wanxian and Badong are not included). In February of the 35th year, the Ministry of Communications proposed the National Government's water, land, and air joint transportation plan to return to the capital. In the first phase, 80,000 people and 46,000 tons of materials were transported from Chongqing to Nanjing by water, and fortunately, the tasks were completed as scheduled.</p>
<p>After the victory, while busy with restoration and transportation, and due to the extreme shortage of ships, our government rented and purchased ships from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, and expanded the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy to make it at least capable of repairing merchant ships first, and then hoped that it could manufacture its own ships. According to the statistics of July this year, the number of ships and tonnage in the country are as follows: Our country has 2,381 ships, with a total tonnage of 722,100 tons (the above figures include state-owned, private, and provincial ships).</p>
<p>In terms of air transport, in addition to the old Zhangjiang Line and North and South Ocean Lines, which are regularly operated by state-owned and private companies, the most economical development is the China Merchants Bureau's active preparation for foreign shipping in addition to the transportation of national and public troops. In the past few months, eight foreign shipping lines have been opened one after another:</p>
<p>Shanghai-Hong Kong Line - from Shanghai to Hong Kong, the total distance is 823 nautical miles.</p>
<p>China-Vietnam Line - from Shanghai to Fangcheng, the total distance is 1,039 nautical miles.</p>
<p>China-Thailand Line - from Shanghai via Shantou, Hong Kong, to Bangkok, the total distance is 2,350 nautical miles.</p>
<p>China-Guam Line - from Shanghai to Guam, the total distance is 1,687 nautical miles.</p>
<p>Hong Kong-Xiamen-Manila Line - from Hong Kong via Xiamen to Manila, the total distance is 778 nautical miles.</p>
<p>Hong Kong-Singapore Line - from Hong Kong to Singapore, the total distance is 1,448 nautical miles.</p>
<p>China-India Line - from Shanghai via Hong Kong, Singapore, Yangon to Calcutta, the total distance is 3,853 nautical miles.</p>
<p>China-Japan Line - from Shanghai to Sasebo, Kobe.</p>
<p>In addition, the Zhonglian Shipping Company's Zhenlian ship once sailed from Shanghai to Sydney, Australia, which is also a feat of China's shipping industry after the war.</p>
<p>How to Develop Shipping</p>
<p>After the recovery, the needs of domestic inland and coastal passenger and freight transportation should be supplied by the Chinese themselves. Therefore, not only should the original ships and tonnage of the country before the war be restored by themselves, but also the foreign ships and tonnage that sailed in our inland and coastal areas before the war should also be made up for by the current shipping companies. In the North and South Oceans and the distant oceans, at least a part of Japan's original shipping status should also be replaced by us. If our government is determined to promote and encourage the national shipping companies to cooperate and move forward, there seems to be no great difficulty in achieving these two goals. However, during this transition period, three things should be done at the same time:</p>
<p>(A) Resist the bad habits of the shipping industry - Shipping is an important social undertaking. The relations between all parties are extremely complex. All operations must be carried out with the spirit of the rule of law and scientific methods in order to innovate the business. Many past bad habits - such as cabin attendants or waiters on ships forcing tips or selling berths, dock workers randomly demanding tips, etc., must be completely eliminated. Shipping companies should jointly establish training classes for low-level crew members to train or recruit a new batch of employees, and then gradually establish a new atmosphere.</p>
<p>(B) Promote shipping construction - The allocation of various ships, the equipment of docks, and the expansion of shipyards across the country must be carried out in a timely manner.</p>
<p>(C) Train naval talents - The lack of naval talents can be seen from the fact that some private shipping companies still use Westerners as captains. If they are not cultivated in time, they will be even more insufficient in the future. The government should strengthen commercial, maritime, and fisheries schools. A hundred years of cultivating people is the fundamental solution.</p>
<p>These three tasks; at present, the China Merchants Bureau is reforming the bad habits of docks, self-managing labor, actively repairing warehouses and docks across the country, and opening crew training classes. Although there are many difficulties, the bureau is making unremitting efforts. All private shipping companies are also joining forces to work hard to improve, and satisfactory results will be achieved in a considerable period of time.</p>
<p>For a century, according to the figures published by the customs, our country's import and export figures have often been far greater than exports, which is the main reason for our country's poverty and weakness. What is the reason for this? To put it simply, the authorities in charge have deeply ignored the importance of shipping and foreign trade. This can be illustrated by the current situation in the United Kingdom: At present, the United Kingdom is feeling the lack of food and fuel, and the United States is automatically willing to provide assistance, but the British authorities require that all assistance be carried by British ships.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Public Utilities Over the Past Eighty Years (Continued from Page Twenty-One)</h3>
<p>Four: Gas</p>
<p>Historical Development</p>
<p>The British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company was established in the fifth year of the reign of Tongzhi during the Qing Dynasty (1866). In the twenty-seventh year of the reign of Guangxu (1901), it expanded its shares and registered with the Hong Kong government. Its business area included both concessions, making it the only gas company in the city. In the winter of the twenty-seventh year of the Republic of China (1938), the Japanese opened a gas factory in Beiqi Bay, Zhanghuabang, Wusong. They also established the Greater Shanghai Gas Company as a business office in Wujiaochang in the central urban area, aiming to compete with the British-owned Shanghai Gas Company. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Japanese seized the company and merged it with the Wusong Gas Factory to operate as the so-called Greater Shanghai Gas Company. With the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Public Utilities Bureau took over the gas factory and renamed it the Wusong Gas Factory, making it one of the city's public utilities. The Shanghai Gas Company was returned to its original owners and is now known as the Shanghai Gas Company.</p>
<p>Overview of the Post-War Recovery</p>
<p>After the Wusong Gas Factory was taken over by the Public Utilities Bureau, it was immediately reorganized and its equipment was enhanced. Gas production increased from 280,000 cubic meters per month (January of the 35th year of the Republic) to 445,995 cubic meters (December of the 35th year of the Republic), providing a surplus. The Bureau then negotiated a contract with the Shanghai Gas Company to jointly supply gas to the Hongkou area, starting in December of the 35th year of the Republic. The Wusong Factory sold 100,000 to 700,000 cubic feet of gas to the Gas Company daily to supplement its supply shortage.</p>
<p>Gas is the most economical and clean fuel, and the public's need for it is extremely urgent. In order to promote gas supply for the benefit of the public, the Public Utilities Bureau planned a city-wide gas network to achieve balanced distribution. It planned to establish a gas factory in Nanshi. The Nanshi Gas Design Office was established in October of the 35th year of the Republic to be responsible for the planning. A preliminary plan has been completed. Before the factory is built, it was decided that the Wusong Gas Factory would first lay a main pipe under Xizang Road to reach Nanshi, and then distribute branches to various roads. The preliminary plan is to connect 500 households first, which should be realized soon.</p>
<p>Five: Land Transportation</p>
<p>Historical Development</p>
<p>(A) Tram Section: The exclusive right of the British-owned Shanghai Tramways Company was transferred by Bruce, Peebles Co. In the thirty-fourth year of the reign of Guangxu during the Qing Dynasty (1908), streetcars began operating in the Public Concession. In November of the third year of the Republic of China (1914), trackless trolleys began operating. The French-owned Tramway and Electric Lighting Company purchased the equipment of the Belgian International Far East Company. Streetcars began operating in January of the thirty-fourth year of the reign of Guangxu. Trackless trolleys began operating in August of the fifteenth year of the Republic of China (1926), operating in the French Concession. In the first year of the Republic of China (1912), Shanghai gentry Lu Bohong and others raised funds to organize the Chinese-owned Tramways Company. It began operating on August 11 of the second year of the Republic of China, operating in the Hunan district of Shanghai. In the seventh year of the Republic of China (1918), it was merged into the Chinese-owned Electric Company. (B) Bus Section: The Chinese-owned Bus Company was established in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China (1924), operating in Zhabei, Jiangwan, the city center, Yinxiang, Zhenru, and other districts. It ceased operations due to the military impact of the Sino-Japanese War. The British-owned China Bus Company was also established in the same year, operating in the Public Concession. After the Shanghai-Hunan Bus Company ceased operations, the Public Utilities Bureau established the Bus Management Office in the twenty-third year of the Republic of China (1934) to maintain transportation in Nanshi and Caojing. (C) Small Line Section: One is the Shangnan Transportation Company, and the other is the Shangchuan Transportation Company. The former was initiated in the spring of the tenth year of the Republic of China (1921). It first organized the Shangchang Long-Distance Bus Company, operating Ford buses. It then paved tracks to operate small trains in response to the needs of travelers. In the twenty-second year of the Republic of China (1933), it was renamed Shangnan Transportation Co., Ltd. The latter was prepared in the tenth year of the Republic of China (1921). Construction of the  Road began in February of the eleventh year (1922). The company was established in April of the thirteenth year (1924). The section from Qingning Temple to Xijia Road opened first in October of the fourteenth year (1925). The entire line was completed and opened to traffic in July of the fifteenth year (1926). In addition, long-distance buses connecting neighboring counties included the Shanghai-Tai Long-Distance Bus Company, which opened in January of the eleventh year of the Republic of China, and the Shanghai  Long-Distance Bus Company, which opened in December of the same year. The Shangsong Long-Distance Bus Company was founded on October 10 of the twenty-first year of the Republic. The Xihu Long-Distance Bus Company opened on August 15 of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic, all based in this city, forming a transportation radiation pattern.</p>
<p>During the period of occupation, the Japanese forcibly occupied the British-owned Tramways Company and the British-owned China Bus Company, merging and reorganizing them into the Shanghai Urban Transportation Company. The Shangchuan and Shangnan Transportation Companies were occupied by the puppet municipal government, which then established the Shangchuan and Shangnan Road Management Offices to control them. Other long-distance buses were either used by our army for military purposes or seized by the enemy, and all ceased operations. After the victory, the Public Utilities Bureau took over the companies separately, returning them to their original owners. However, the British-owned China Bus Company declared its closure because it had no vehicles left due to wartime damage. The tram section of the Chinese-owned Electric Company was completely dismantled by the enemy and puppets and sent to Tianjin. Negotiations are still underway to recover it, and recovery is not expected in the near future, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>Overview of the Post-War Recovery</p>
<p>The city had a total of 28 streetcar and trackless trolley lines operated by Chinese, British, and French companies before the war, which were reduced to 12 lines during the war. Since the city's recovery, under the supervision of the Public Utilities Bureau, the British side has restored eight streetcar lines and six trackless trolley lines. The French side has restored five streetcar lines, three trackless trolley lines, and two bus lines. In order to facilitate travel, the Public Utilities Bureau promoted the replacement of tracks on Huashan Road by the British and French companies to implement joint operations. However, this can only be realized after Huashan Road is widened due to the narrow road surface.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the victory, the city's public transportation was severely destroyed by the enemy. With few vehicles and many people, it was difficult to meet the needs. In view of this, the Public Utilities Bureau tried its best to prepare buses. In the winter of the 34th year of the Republic, the Bus Company Preparatory Committee and the Tram Company Preparatory Office were established to actively promote the project. First, the military department was requested to issue 100 old vehicles, which were dismantled and transformed into buses to provide service. Subsequently, large loans were negotiated with banks, and new vehicles were purchased and routes were added. By November of the 35th year of the Republic, in order to centralize planning, the two preparatory institutions were merged and renamed the Public Transportation Company Preparatory Committee. As of July of this year, there were 171 buses operating on 11 lines, totaling 66 kilometers.</p>
<p>For suburban transportation, the policy is to encourage private operation. Suburban routes are designated, and before formally operating companies begin operations, motor vehicle companies or Shanghai bus companies holding temporary road operation licenses are temporarily allowed to operate temporary detour passenger vehicles. There are already seven companies that have been approved to operate:</p>
<p>The former Shangnan two small railways have also been repaired and equipped by the Public Utilities Bureau, and the number of services has been increased. Transportation between various places in Pudong and this city has also gradually returned to the pre-war state.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, there are more and more other vehicles in the city. According to the statistics at the end of July of the 36th year, the numbers are as follows:</p>
<p>However, since most streets have not been widened, how to improve such a complicated situation with so many vehicles has become a very difficult problem to solve. (Continued on page 23) The calendar in the first year of the Republic used the Yellow Emperor's era on the cover.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Public Utilities Over the Past Eighty Years (Continued from Page Twenty-Two)</h3>
<p>Six: Water Transportation</p>
<p>Historical Development</p>
<p>The banks of the Huangpu River are densely populated, and business dealings are frequent. Before the establishment of ferry services, water transportation relied entirely on hand-rowed boats, which were dangerous, time-consuming, and very inconvenient. In September of the second year of the reign of Xuantong (1910), the Pudong Embankment Works Relief Bureau leased small ferries to operate between the east and west sides of Pudong to facilitate office work, carrying passengers and charging ferry fares. After reporting to the county-level agencies for registration, a trial voyage was conducted on December 5, marking the beginning of government-run ferry services. Initially, the route ran directly from Donggou to the Copper Statue Pier on the Bund of Nanjing Road. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, the Xidu route was added, and in the eighth year, the Xi  route was added. The ferries used at the beginning were all leased. In the second year of the Republic of China, the first ferry, the Gongyi, was built. In July of the eleventh year, the Gongfu ferry was purchased and renamed the Gongan. In addition, there were seven large and small tugboats such as the Gongli, Gongji, and Gongdao, and three other fast boats and sampans, operating in Dong  , Qingning Temple, Xidu, and other places. Docks were also built. In the autumn of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China (1927), the Shanghai Special Municipality was established, and the ferry service was transferred from the Embankment Works Bureau. Initially, it was temporarily managed by the Pudong Office of the Municipal Government. In December of the same year, the office was abolished, and the Public Utilities Bureau and the Finance Bureau took over the management, establishing the Pudong Ferry Management Office. In July of the seventeenth year (1928), the Finance Bureau transferred the original management and operation to the Public Utilities Bureau, renaming the Pudong Ferry Management Office the Pujiang Ferry Management Office. In the nineteenth year, it was renamed the Ferry General Management Office. In August of the twentieth year, the Shanghai Industrial Trust Company took over the city's ferry business and renamed it the Shanghai Ferry Management Office.</p>
<p>All fourteen ferries of the office were requisitioned during the war. Subsequently, the puppet municipal government reorganized it into the Shanghai Special Municipality Ferry Company, with only five ferries and four docks remaining. After the Public Utilities Bureau took over in September of the 34th year, it established the Ferry Company Preparatory Office to continue operations.</p>
<p>Overview of the Post-War Recovery</p>
<p>The Public Utilities Bureau realized that the ferry service had the mission of developing the Pudong area and relieving the pressure of the population between the east and west sides of the Huangpu River. Its importance cannot be underestimated, and it is necessary to pool resources, expand equipment, and open up routes. Therefore, the Shanghai Ferry Company Preparatory Office was first established to organize a joint public-private limited company. After more than a year of effort, it was finally completed. The total capital was set at 1.5 billion national currency. The existing city ferries, docks, and all equipment were evaluated as public shares, accounting for one-third of the total capital. The remaining two-thirds, which were non-public shares, were negotiated to be subscribed by banks and citizens. The founding meeting was held on November 20 of the 35th year, and an exclusive contract was signed with the municipal government. By March of the 36th year, the company was formally established.</p>
<p>In the past, the ferry service only provided transportation for passengers. However, Pudong has many warehouses and docks. Goods crossing the river must be transferred, resulting in huge losses of time and money, which has further increased prices. In order to remedy this shortcoming, the Public Utilities Bureau decided to build a truck ferry before the cross-river project could be implemented. It urged the city ferry service to actively carry out the project and worked with the Public Works Bureau and the Land Administration Bureau to survey and determine the location of the docks. The south bank of Pudong was designated as the south pier, and the Lujiabang Branch Road on the west bank was designated as the west pier. Construction began in June of the 36th year, and the required ferries have also been purchased. It is scheduled to open to traffic on October 10.</p>
<p>Regarding the private ferry services, there were more than 30 locations along the Huangpu and Wusong Rivers before the war, but most of them ceased operations during the war. After the city's recovery, the Public Utilities Bureau immediately urged them to resume operations one by one. Currently, there are 32 locations that have signed contracts to operate. In order to ensure the safety of travelers, important ferries on the Huangpu River have been ordered to switch to tugboats, and ferries on the Wusong River have been ordered to switch to standard ferries. As of July of the 36th year, 12 ferries on the Huangpu River have been converted to tugboats, and 14 ferries on the Wusong River have been converted to standard ferries.</p>
<p>Seven: Docks and Warehouses</p>
<p>Historical Development</p>
<p>The Huangpu River stretches for more than 40 kilometers from Jiansong Bridge in Nanshi to Wusong. Docks are densely distributed along both banks of the Huangpu River. Some are built by the city itself, some are built by the former Public Works Bureau and the French Municipal Council, some are built by Chinese, and some are operated by foreign merchants. They vary in size and structure. In Nanshi, there are a total of 21 city-owned docks of various sizes. Along the Suzhou River, from Waibaidu Bridge to Jujia Bridge, there are 174 fixed small docks, most of which are city-owned, except for a few built by merchants. In order to manage docks and warehouses, the Public Utilities Bureau established the Docks and Warehouses Management Office in the twentieth year of the Republic of China (1931) to dredge shorelines, repair docks and revetments, and plan the construction of docks. After the city's recovery and the recovery of the concessions, in addition to transferring the docks to their original owners by the Maritime Administration Bureau and the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearance Office based on the nature of the ownership of each dock, those belonging to the municipal government and the former Public Works Bureau and Municipal Council were taken over and managed by the Public Utilities Bureau. In October of the 34th year, the Docks and Warehouses Management Office was restored to execute its original duties.</p>
<p>Overview of the Post-War Recovery</p>
<p>All 21 city-owned docks in Nanshi were scattered by the enemy during the war. The six docks that remained were moved from other places and were not the original ones. After the victory, shipping resumed, and the need for docks was extremely urgent. It was urgent to plan and restore them in a unified manner. In addition to partial repairs to accommodate ships, the Nanshi Docks Restoration Committee was organized in February of the 36th year to carry out the restoration project in two phases. The first phase was to repair docks 1 to 9, and the second phase was to repair the remaining docks. The first phase was entrusted to the Public Works Bureau and began in early February of the 36th year and is about to be completed. Except for Dock 7, which is a wooden floating dock with a wooden surface, and Dock 8, which is a steel floating dock with a cement surface, the rest are steel floating docks with a steel surface. It is now planned to establish this area as a model dock area in the city. The second phase will begin after the first phase is completed.</p>
<p>The Nanshi docks were not dredged at all during the period of occupation, and the silt was very thick. Without dredging, ships could not dock, and even if there were docks, they would be useless. Therefore, before repairing the docks, the Public Utilities Bureau entrusted the Junpu Bureau to dredge them. Dredging work was carried out on Docks 1 to 9 in November of the 35th year and was completed in April of the 36th year. Dredging was then continued on Docks 10 to 12 and Docks 1 to 7 and 11 to 14 of the Waixiao Company to facilitate berthing.</p>
<p>Eight: Telephone</p>
<p>Historical Development</p>
<p>Shanghai's telephone service was initiated by the Great Northern Telegraph Company, which was established in the seventh year of the reign of Guangxu (1881) and also operated special zone telephone services on a small scale. The following year, it was taken over by the China-Japan Telephone Company. In the twenty-fourth year of the reign of Guangxu (1898), the China-Foreign Telephone Company took over the concession telephone service and signed an exclusive contract with the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession. It was announced to be established in the following year (1899). In August of the nineteenth year of the Republic of China (1930), the company sold all its assets to the American-owned Shanghai Telephone Company, and the installation of rotary automatic telephones in the concession was completed in the twenty-first year of the Republic of China. The city telephone service was operated by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau. The bureau was established in the twenty-eighth year of the reign of Guangxu (1902). Initially, the scale was very small. It was not until the ninth year of the Republic of China (1920) that it purchased land to build its own office building. In the eighteenth year (1929), it installed step-by-step automatic telephones, and its business gradually expanded, communicating with the concession telephones through a transfer method.</p>
<p>Overview of the Post-War Recovery</p>
<p>During the enemy occupation, Shanghai's telephone equipment and lines were not only not added to, but also severely damaged. The destruction was particularly severe in Nanshi, Zhabei, and other districts. Now that the population has increased sharply, and the number of machines has decreased for many years, the Bureau feels that the supply cannot meet the demand. The Shanghai Telephone Company already has too many machines in arrears. Under the supervision of the Public Utilities Bureau, it has ordered 10,000 new machines from abroad, which will allow it to expand its subscribers after they arrive. The Public Utilities Bureau has also supervised and urged the company to improve its management and technology. Over the past two years, the situation has improved. According to the company's report, the percentage of calls that are dialed within five seconds has increased from 72.1% to 86.1%. At the same time, the "Temporary Restrictions on Telephone Installation" were formulated to meet the urgent needs of military and government agencies. Ordinary telephones are temporarily restricted from being installed. The Public Utilities Bureau and the company also jointly run a telephone engineering training class to prepare telephone technical personnel.</p>
<p>In addition, the supervision of the publication of new telephone directories is also worth mentioning. The city's telephone directory had long been discontinued. After the recovery, the addresses and names of subscribers changed greatly. Not only was it difficult for subscribers to inquire, but the company's inquiry office was particularly overwhelmed. Therefore, in the spring of the 35th year, the Public Utilities Bureau began to negotiate with the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications to publish a unified telephone directory, including both new and old street names, which would not only make it easier for users to check, but also promote the new street names. With the assistance of the Public Utilities Bureau, the company completed the investigation and compilation. The manuscript was completed at the end of October of the 35th year, with a total of over 65,000 subscribers and 90,000 telephones. The Chinese Science Company printed 100,000 copies of the 1,000-page Chinese version and 20,000 copies of the 550-page Western version, consuming more than 200 tons of paper. The printing was completed in February of the 36th year and distributed for use.</p>
<p>Nine: Streetlights, Standard Clocks Streetlights</p>
<p>Shanghai's streetlights were established in the eighth year of the reign of Guangxu (1882). Initially, arc lights were operated by the Shanghai Electric Company. In the sixteenth year of the reign of Guangxu, incandescent electric lights began to be used as streetlights. In the 26th year of the Republic of China, there was a total of 23,799 lights in the city. The losses were heavy during the war, especially in the old urban areas of Zhabei, Hunan, and Pudong, which were almost completely destroyed. Since the recovery, the Public Utilities Bureau has actively repaired and added lights. As of July of the 36th year, the city has gradually restored a total of 15,309 lights, an increase of 7,274 lights compared to the 8,035 lights when it was first taken over. However, there is still a long way to go to restore the pre-war state. Traffic lights are a necessary equipment for traffic control. The Public Utilities Bureau has added 18 locations in the most congested central area. In Nanshi, one set each has been added at the intersection of Laoximen Xieqiao Zhizaoju Road, the intersection of Dongmen Road Lima Road, and the intersection of Laobeimen  Hailu Road to meet the needs.</p>
<p>Standard Clock</p>
<p>In order to standardize the time and cultivate the public's habit of punctuality, the Public Utilities Bureau installed standard clocks on the main roads of Hunan and Zhabei in the 20th year of the Republic of China. The project was completed and put into use in October of that year, with a total of two master clocks and 24 slave clocks. All were destroyed during the war. After the victory, the Public Utilities Bureau has repaired and installed 24 clocks, and is still planning to promote the installation.</p>
<p>Ten: Conclusion</p>
<p>Public utilities are not only related to people's daily lives, but also essential for urban prosperity. In any area, if there is nothing of water, electricity, gas, telephone, and vehicle transportation, people's lives will experience what kind of inconvenience; and if the equipment is complete and the supply is sufficient, people's lives will experience what kind of convenience. Public utilities have a huge power to attract population and are an important condition for creating urban prosperity. The reason why Shanghai's  is superior to the rest of the country is that the development of its public utilities should be regarded as a major factor.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Shanghai's most important facility is the construction of the port. I am honored to be the convener of the drafting plan for the Shanghai Permanent Port Affairs Agency. This plan has been approved by the Port Affairs Reorganization Committee for three  and will soon be submitted to the central government, hoping to be realized as soon as possible. As for the current work, the first priority should be to expand power, conserve waste, and increase industrial production; the second priority should be to improve water supply in western Shanghai and complete the western Shanghai water plant; the third priority should be to expand the Wusong gas plant to transfer gas to residents in Nanshi; the fourth priority should be to increase public vehicles to facilitate people's "travel"; and the fifth priority should be to fully supply other public utilities in a coordinated manner. Since taking over the matter, I have gathered experts to study it together, focusing on both short-term and long-term solutions, and starting to promote it in order to meet the needs of the public and develop urban planning, with "rationalization", "enterprise", and "massization" as the goals, and proceeding step by step. All of this is a major topic for the present, and it requires the cooperation of all citizens to make the greatest effort to achieve success.</p>
<h3>The Abdication Edict of Emperor Xuantong</h3>
<p>When the Qing Emperor abdicated, the abdication edict for Xuantong was written by the Number One Scholar, Nantong Zhang Jian. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>"We, by the grace of Empress Dowager Longyu's decree, due to the uprising of the people's army and the response of the provinces, the nine summers are boiling and the people are suffering. We specially ordered Yuan Shikai to send officials to discuss the overall situation with representatives of the Republic, to discuss the opening of a parliament, and to decide on the form of government. For two months, there has been no definite solution. The north and south are separated and hold each other in check. Merchants are stranded on the road and soldiers are exposed in the fields. It is only because the form of government has not been decided for a day that the people's livelihood is uneasy for a day. Now, the psychology of the people throughout the country mostly leans towards the republic. The provinces in the south have already advocated concessions, and the generals in the north also advocate them. The will of the people is known, and the mandate of heaven is knowable. How can I bear to use the honor of one family to reject the preferences of the people? Therefore, looking at the overall situation and examining the feelings, I specially led the emperor to return the ruling power to the whole country, and decided on a republic and constitutional form of government, to comfort the hearts of the people at home who are tired of war and hope for governance, and to reach the meaning of the ancient sages who regarded the world as public. Yuan Shikai was previously elected by the Consultative Assembly as Prime Minister. At this time of transition, there should be a way to unify the north and south. Yuan Shikai will organize a provisional government to negotiate unification methods with the people's army, so that the people can live in peace and the sea can be peaceful. The five races of Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan will still unite, with complete territory, into a great Republic of China. I and the emperor feel that we can retire to a comfortable and leisurely life, spend our years leisurely, receive the courteous treatment of the people for a long time, and personally witness the completion of the national rule. Isn't that wonderful? This is my order!"</p>
<p>At that time, he was forced by the situation, and although he said "can retire to a comfortable and leisurely life", "Isn't that Wonderful", but once he was lured by the Japanese, he became furious and became a puppet. Pu Yi was indeed ridiculous and pathetic. Anecdotes of National Day</p>
