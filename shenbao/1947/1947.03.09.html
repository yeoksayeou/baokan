<p>〔中央社長春八日電〕松花江南岸已無共軍蹤跡，國軍己完成反擊任務，刻正肅淸地方，以安定民生。此次共軍南犯，其執遼野戰軍區司令員兼第三師師長黃克誠，於德東戰役在龍鳳山被國軍擊斃。其他團營長死於國軍砲火者尙多。</p>

<p>〔中央社長春八日電〕杜長官聿明八日晚八時十五分，在長春中央社廣播電台播講長春外圍戰役經過，略謂：此次會戰。在戰略上爲誘敵深入，限於機密，事先不能宣布，致使沿江各縣民衆遭受空前浩刦，長永兩市父老，亦飽受虛驚，內心至爲不安，共軍發動其軍軍攻勢，其手段之殘酷，行爲之卑劣，東北同胞必能記憶體察，共軍先會兩度企圖進犯長春，均未得逞，今復傾巢渡江來犯，事先毛澤東並來東北，親自主持，林彪並會在哈爾濱召集軍事會議，其重視此一行動，由此可見。共軍此次發動軍隊號稱三十萬，價已動員二十萬人，各路進犯，其聲勢之大，爲前此所未有，滿擬略取長春，進竄遼潘，同時，在遼南。遼西亦發動攻勢聲援，共軍陰謀車先早經國軍料到，並經擬定對策，故自共軍大部渡注後，國軍即照預定計劃逐步實施，集中軍力，縮短戰綫，而德惠守軍僅四營之衆，橋頭堡守軍亦僅兩排兵力，均能遵照命令，獨立固守，與共軍主力血戰十日，不爲所動。共軍攻勢頓挫，受重大犧牲，同時，我吉長兩地樹動部隊，更分路出擊，一舉將其擊破，三日而圍解，共軍狼狽逃竄，喪失精銳三萬餘，其狂妄企圖，終成幻影。綜之，此次會戰，異常兇猛，而我終能擊潰共車，在軍事上打破其攻堅企圖，政冶上打倒其武力割據野心。同時，擊破其國際宣傳陰謀，此輝煌戰果，固有賴於全體官兵勇敢犧牲，而我長市同胞動員六十萬人，維持治安，援助國軍。德惠軍民一體壞定不移，見義勇爲之精神，寅爲中國五千年民族道德之傳統表現，亦爲軍民合作的精神表徵。</p>
<h3>遼南共軍　積極活動</h3>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽八日電〕遼南共軍活動，近日又趨積極，據軍息：（一）共軍的四千餘人，於三日晨全力園攻廟西鎭北十五公里之馬家屯，該地共軍以全力抵禦，反復衝殺，血戰一畫夜，共軍傷亡甚衆，及四日午國軍援兵趕到，立予擊潰，殘餘共軍遺屍六百餘具，向東南方竄去。（二）四日夜共軍約三千餘，向普籣店東一公里之時家屯守軍襲擊，另以一部迂迦時家屯以北地區，企圖斷絕國軍之外援，經守軍奮勇抵抗，至六日拂曉，已將其迂迴部隊擊退，惟正面共軍仍在戰鬥中。</p>
<p>〔又電〕攻佔通遼之共軍的二萬餘人，我守軍於突圍後，撇至大林附近整頓後，即與馳援部隊會合，向當面之共軍截擊，激戰甚烈，共軍傷亡千餘名，不支四竄，我軍乘勝進迫城郊。</p>
<p>〔又電〕大連以北共軍，五日再犯時家屯（普蘭店東），國軍已予以有力阻擊。</p>
<h3>中共與蘇以貨易貨　大批糧食運往蘇境</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約七日電〕據約紐時報記者威爾斯三月六日自長春來電稱：東北共產黨，每日以六千噸糧食，經鐵道運往蘇屬西伯利亞，交換蘇方之燃煤，煤油，香水，火柴，香姻及其他物品，威氏引述甫自共產黨區抵達長春之中國鐵路工程師及其他人員之言曰：哈爾濱共產黨與蘇聯成立以貨易貨之協定將糧食運往西伯利亞，交易自二月前開始。至今己有九十萬噸小麥，大豆，牛肉，猪肉，高梁，玉米，運往蘇聯，皮毛等亦包括在內。據威氏稱：平均每日有貨車十輛，駛離哈爾濱，每輛裝貨六百噸，其中五輛，駛往　濱，另五輛駛往綏芬河。渠稱：自一月杪開始貨運後，蘇聯會以六十五個日本製造之火車頭，運至哈爾濱。是項車頭，係蘇軍佔領柬北時所搬去者。此外並派遺大批鐵道技術人員抵哈市。威氏幷稱：據甫自哈爾濱抵此之人士謂：自貨運開始後，哈市糧價上漲，已超過百分之二百。共產黨在松花江沿岸向國軍發動之兩度攻勢，均遭失敗後，抗幣價格大跌，渠等乃開始囤糧，結果更造成通貨膨脹。據稱：居民中最貧窮者，亦均轉而反對共產黨。此種厭恨，係由於嚴寒時缺乏燃煤，商業停滯，賦稅繁里，自十八歲至四十五歲，一律徵入，以及各家戶駐紮共軍所造成，凡敢於批評共黨政權者，均被月爲「絕對反動派」，而予格殺，甚多人士，均逃往國軍地區。共黨於哈爾濱簽發出境許可證，准人民赴長春購買哈爾濱獨缺之貨物，唯獲得是項許可證之手續極繁，費時極久，因共黨恐其一去不返也。</p>
<p>中共統治下　無宗敎自由</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平八日電〕美國聖哥侖彼斯敎會之神父，全國天生敎新聞社通訊員康諾氏，最近自延安來此。今日在英文報上發表一聲明，否認在延安有宗敎之自由。此爲各美國觀察家中，對中共宗敎政策指斥最嚴厲之文章。其中力言：一中共在華北各地殘害宗敎，各地雖有形式上與程度上之不同，然在原則上則均爲一致」。</p>
<p>此聲明乃直接駁斥最近聯合社關於延安宗敎自由之報道，文前附有延安敎堂之照片，題爲：「被褻凟之聖地」。文稱「延安之敎堂，現由中共堆儲糧食。佈道壇己堆滿小米，榖類。敎堂之窗戶悉數損毀。牆上貼滿中共之標語」。</p>
<p>「二月十五日，余在延安爲天主敎徒做禮拜。禮拜並非在敎堂中，而在前天主敎某小學中舉行。余猜想中共完欲將我人之集會用作宣傳，果然上海各報即有聯合社C.T.Sim關於延安二月十五日宗敎集會之報導。此親自參加余之宗敎集會之聯合社記者，究爲何人？當時唯有能說英語之華人爲馬聲明（譯音），渠爲中共黨員，隸於十八集團之下。在余訪問敎堂時一直伴余左右。渠爲外國記者，聯絡處之高級官員，余不敢斷定此新開爲馬氏所發。然渠必爲該文之捉刀人無疑也。渠並未說明爲何余不能在敎堂中做禮拜，余可指出其原因爲敎堂各處之建築，除該小學之兩室外，已均被中共軍隊所佔用」。</p>
<p>「當馬君伴余往見梁神父時，，余用拉丁語對梁神父談話，然渠搖頭不答。神色頗形不安。梁神父爲輔仁大學之畢業生熱請拉丁文，爲何緘口不言？頗使余鶯奇。以後乃知在中共長官前不該用彼所不知之言語交談也。」</p>
<p>「中共各領袖均一致宣揚中共之宗敎自由，然各地實行時，均陽奉陰遠。此種情形軍調部之美方官員，均所熟知者，僅因其努力於調處，故不欲自由發言耳，目前已屆加以揚發之時矣」。</p>

<p>星期論壇</p>
<h3>從道德觀念論對外關係</h3>
<p>— 蔣君章</p>
<p>我們中國民族，有一個普遍的傳統的道德，那就是崇功報德的觀念。戰國時魏公子無忌，竊兵符，奪晋鄙軍，破秦兵面解趙圍，趙王與平原君誠敬以迎，無忌有德色，他部下有一個屠夫出身的軍官呌做朱亥，以「人有德於我，不可或忘；我有德於人，不可不忘」的意義諫他，他欣然接受，歷史傳爲美談。郭沫若先生還特別做了一部「虎符」的劇本，把信陵君救趙的一段歷史，編排一下，予以宣揚，在陪都重慶，吸引了不少的觀衆，這種受德必報，流德不望報的觀念，是不可否認的高尚道德。這裏所謂「報」，不外乎是四種方式，即以德報德，以怨報怨，以德報怨，和以怨報德，無論那一個中國人，對於「以怨報德」的事件，莫不深惡痛絕，決不致予以　美提倡，這一點可以說是我們民族道德之一。</p>
<p>我們看中美的關係，美國傳統的以主權獨立，領土完整，鬥戶開放，機會均等的政策，來處置和中國有關係的事件，這當然有他的立塲，但這些似還不能在中網人心目中造成一個「怨」字。至在這次大戰中，美國以人力財力物力來支助我們的抗戰，最後還不惜流其人民之血於中國戰塲，這固然是爲了共同的利益，但總也不致結怨於中網的人民嗎？至於戰後，美網帮助我們受降，帮助我們還俘，給我們信用貨款，調解我們內部的爭端，協助我們軍隊的訓練，還希望在可能的情况下，作更大的經濟援助，使我們成爲一個民主富强的國家。美國用這樣的政策來對待中國，固然是爲了太平洋的和平，也就是爲了他自己的安全，但這些措施，對於我們中國，並沒有什麼危書，也何致結成不解之怨呢？所以，我們總觀反美遝動的中心點是美軍的駐華，其要求的中心是美軍撤退，其實這個問題在我們一般的中國人心裏是明瞭得很的，時期一到，美軍必回，即欲挽留，亦不可得，而他們回去的時候，一定是乾乾凈凈的回去，決不要搬取我們一草一木，因此，中國境內的反美運動，實無目的可言。</p>
<p>中國境內的反美運動，雖然有其明顯的國際性，但是實際上的中心，恐怕還是黨派的利益，有幾個間單的事實，我們可以回顯一下：（一）當美國爲了向日本反攻要整編中國軍隊配以美國裝備的時候，中共曾經提出比例裝配中共部隊的要求，他們是以抗戰的努力來迎合着美人從速擊敗日本的心理，以打動美國一部份將領的，給果是失敗了，美將史迪威美駐華火使商思之去職，與此事有聯帶關係，在這個事件發生以前，中共是不反美的，在這件事發生以後，中共和息國的左翼人士常常提起史氏的去職，表示着很大的惋惜；而美國政府的負責人，自此以後常被中共稱爲反動份子了。（二）日本投降以後的一個時問，是中共發展的黃金時期，他們是從七十來縣的地盤在一兩個月的時期之內，擴展到三百多縣；在這個時間之內，美國的海軍正在努力幫助中國政府軍隊辦理受降和遺俘的工作，而在國際政治舞台上，美蘇關係正是轉變很快的時候，從日本投降以後，中共的反美運動便一天開展一天。從這些軍實中，我們可以看出中共的反美運動，到底是爲了社會主義祖國？還是爲了中國共產黨本身？我們不難得到正確的答案。而這一個運動的發展，有沒有爲了國家和民族打算？我們更可以不想而知了。</p>
<p>由於上述第二個事實的發展，所以勝利以後中共反美的第一個口號是反對美軍駐華，而他的要求是美軍撤離中國，但是美軍駐華，不是突然而來，他們是爲了聯合國的勝利，爲了在中國戰塲上協力擊敗日本而來，並不是乘勝打刦，搬取物資而來，戰爭初了，流血未乾，任務未畢，努力正深，而就要美軍撤去，試想這個遝動如何可以開展得來？但是中共自有其宣傳的妙法，當日本投降之夕，中共軍總司令朱德連發七個命令要他的部隊向政府軍隊或待降的敵僞軍進攻，攻城略地，連　勝利的消息，中共把這時的戰爭呌做「解放」，呌做「起義」，到了十月以後戰爭沒有什麼進步了，或者竟是遭到失敗，他把遺時的戰爭呌做內戰，內戰是應當反對的，他就倡導反內戰遝動，美軍帮助政府軍隊受降和遺俘，這顯然是有益於政府軍隊，反之即于中共軍隊不利，因此中共把助長內戰的罪名，加在來華的美軍頭上，加以反對，所以中共反美遝動的正式展開，是在反內戰的掩護下進行的，中美商約成立的時候，中共又來一次的反美運動，是以不平等爲口實，以民族資本和工商業的繁榮爲號召而進行的，這裏却沒有方法牽上美軍在華的問題，所以只好撤開不講。但是北平東岸事件，美軍强奸女生沈崇，這雖是一個軍士犯法的簡單事件，却是與美軍駐華有關，而且這件事恰好和中國社會的貞操觀念相背，便可利用這稱心理來，把問題擴大，却是歸根到底要美軍撤退，推之勸工大樓事件是反美運動的一種，主要的是抵制美貨，但必在愛用國貨的掩護下這個運動始能開展，其理由正同，總之，中共以奪取政權爲目標，以政府爲其敵人，以政府的友人爲其準敵人，因而以全力來反他。假定說蘇聯和美國一樣的熟誠援助政府以實現中國的統一，或蘇美兩國對中國的態度易地而處，那末中共該要對那一個國家來做反對的運動？也是一個淺顯易答的問題了。</p>
<p>中共在政府區域的反美運動，是居於指導的地位，而由一設不滿意於政府措施的文人或工商家來出面實施的，我們如果把幾次主要反美運動的主持人及其黨派關係和努力宣傳的報紙來加以比對，就可以發現歷次反美運動中，演說的，做文章的，發表談話的，方式不一，大名總只有幾個，彷彿這幾位先牛是以此爲專業似的，他們專做這一種事業，究竟爲了什麼？他們也說是爲着和平，爲着民主，爲着國家和民族的利益，但眞正的目的何在？也只有他們自己知道，我們中國社會普遍存在着一種帮閒階級，可以稱做「紳士」，他們是以「排難解紛」爲專業，因此也希望社會上的「難」與「紛」愈多態好，否則他們便是無可排解，也便將毫無所得，我們試以此種情形和當前政局中的波瀾作一比較，倒也是深堪玩味的。</p>
<p>總之，中國境內的反美遝動，就中國和美國過去的關係和未來的關係去看，就國家和民族的利害關係去看，就中國的民族道德去看，這個運動是不可能發生的，就美國的對華政策去看，這個運動更無發生的必要，但是在黨派利益超過一切的前提之下，竟然發生這個運動，這在我們民族的固有道德上說，實在是一個重大的污點。</p>
<p>我們更從反美運動的發展方法上去看，道是在玩弄羣衆，這是在欺騙人民，我們由國當前對內需要民主和平統一建國，對外則需要協和美蘇，共維太平洋的和平，我們中國不能反美，正興不能反蘇一樣，這是我們智識份子應有的簡單信條。</p>

<h3>國強外長會議開幕前夕　貝文抵達莫斯科　馬歇爾今日自柏林飛蘇</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山八日廣播：莫斯科四强外長會議定十日開暮。英代表今日在貝文率領下，抵達白俄羅斯車站，此為四外長會議首先到達蘇聯之代表團，馬歇爾與皮杜爾將於星期日到達莫斯科，馬歇爾今在柏林與美軍司令麥克納尼作整日之會談，研究長七百頁之盟國管制委會報吿。馬歡爾在柏林宣稱：在未來外長會議中，渠將促使其他三國與美簽訂四十年公約，管轄德國之軍事復員工作，並防止德國戰爭工業之死灰復燃。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科八日電〕貝文外相今午乘專車抵莫斯科時發表談話稱：此次重來莫斯科代表英國人民向蘇聯致意，深覺愉快。渠表示希望世界和平得防止今後的侵略，使全仳界得獲安全。蘇外次維辛斯基親蒞機塲歡迎員文。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦八日廣播：英外相貝文飛抵莫斯科，出席四國外長會議，莫洛托夫並未蒞機塲歡迎，亦無樂隊演奏蘇聯國歌，如平時歡迎各國要人到達蘇京時所常見者，因此引起種種議論，着上週波蘭總理抵達莫斯科時，尙有各種歡迎儀式也。</p>

<p>蘇聯著名外交專家穆寗，會在七日晚發表關於此次會議問題之演說，渠在演說完畢後，聽衆提出問題時指稱：「英國火車十二輛（意即十二項提案）正在來蘇途中，但其中三輛遮蓋嚴密」。穆寗並稱，此次會議以德國問題最感困難，但在誠意合作之下，有種種理由可信德國問題有解決之望。若能根據波茨坦協定訂立對德和約，則吾人不必恐　美國資本主義者將德國淪為殖民地之陰謀云。</p>
<h3>馬卿在柏林透露　擬提訂四國公約</h3>
<p>〔合衆社柏林八日電〕今日馬歇爾在此地透露，美國將在莫斯科四强外長會議中，提議四國四十年協定以管制德國之非軍事化與工業之復活，按去年四月間美國前國務卿貝爾納斯亦曾向英蘇法三國提出同樣之二十五年協定之建議，渠並向法國及其他德國鄰邦保證，在和平未得確切保證前，美國不欲自德國退出。以後貝爾納斯在斯都伽特之演說中，又將期限改為四十年，然英蘇法三國對之迄無表示，最近巴黎似乎希望在英蘇法三角同盟協定外，同時簽訂該項四國協定，以確保共同防止德國再度侵略之可能。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林八日電〕馬歇爾國務卿離此赴蘇京前發表談話稱，美國認為完成貝爾納斯前此建議之四強管制德國公約，極為重要，此乃向世界表示美國繼續關心歐洲，並接受世界他部份之責任。吾人以為此事如能協議，關於德奧之許多困難，均不難迎刃而解。馬卿又曰，全在巴黎曾晤法總統總理及其他要員，使余得以先期明瞭法政府對於歐洲及莫斯科會議之各種意見，在柏林又由美佔領區高級官員如麥克納尼。克萊及墨飛等報吿有關德國之局勢。馬卿定明晨飛莫斯科，渠係向美國公民及美國記者發表前項談話。</p>
<h3>各國盟約談判忙　捷波條約定今日簽字　比捷談判在普拉格進行中</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦八日電〕莫斯科會議開幕前之一星期內，盟約之談判，極為緊張，英法盟約已於星期二在鄧扣克簽字，捷克波蘭條約亦將於星期日在華沙簽字，此兩條約頗多類似之點蓋均有若干棘手之問題尙未解決。英法對於魯爾區未來之控制，以及魯爾產煤之分配，均尙未有協議。當將近簽字之時，因英國任命德人為魯爾工業之管理人，幾使盟約不能簽字，捷波條約談判已有數月，然對於台斯眞及格拉資兩區這誰　仍未有解決辦法，大約在條約中將聲明將此等問題留待兩年內解決。此外比利時與法國舉行既的之初步談話後，比外長史巴克又有普拉格之行，意在與捷克成立盟約，英比之間，自貝文外相在白魯塞爾述及盟約之意見後，盟約之訂立似亦僅為時間問題耳。</p>
<h3>奧京破獲　納粹組織</h3>

<h3>莫斯科生氣逢　各商店爭奇鬥艷</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科八日電〕包圍在雪裏的莫斯科，正忙於熱烈歡迎四外長會議。「莫斯科旅館」與「都成旅館」生氣蓬勃，這兩個迎賓館正作最後一分鐘的進備。旅館中有簇新的靠　與沙發，裝着發亮的皮墊。莫斯科旅館的休息室中心，有一尊史達林的巨型　像，歡迎來賓大　的一角有個大樹實，滿滿陳列蘇聯各種藝術與手工出品，以供外國來賓留作紀念。樣品中包括眼鏡·茶匣·木刻棋子·和油漆的小案子，還有一個滿滿的珠寳糧，陳列手錶和其他物件，飾着烏拉爾山脈出產的名貴寶石，瓷器也是一種動人的陳列品。還有一個完備的書館，滿贜英法文書籍。莫斯科市內各商店正盡其最善，以吸引外國主顧的靑睞，陳列的貨品有蘇聯最新式的女子時裝和著名的香水，以便各國代表買給他們的女春。一隊隊的工人已被徵發掃除街上的積雪。</p>
<h3>美經濟援希問題　下週一白宮將作重大決定　杜魯門取消假期旅行</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓七日電〕白宮新聞秘書羅斯今日宣稱：杜魯門總統巳決定取消原定明日開始之加里比安海假期旅行，並已召集國會國黨領袖，於星期一在白宮開會，討論國際局勢。在羅斯宣布此事之先，杜魯門總統曾與閣僚討論希臘之救濟及其他問題，達四小時半之久。聞總統正在起草向國會提出之咨文，請其批准對希臘放款二億五千萬元，放款條件之一，即為不許以之購買軍火。總統之取消假期旅行，係因英國之本屆財政年度將於三月卅一日終結，美國政府深望在該一日期以前，國會即能批准對希之放款，以减輕英國對希所負担之責任。另聞對土耳其之財政援助，亦已由美政府在考盧之中。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕杜魯門總統今日與政府官員對救濟希臘等問題舉行商談，據悉將決定以一億二千萬元之槍砲及其他軍需運往希臘。此事可望於下星期二以前正式宣佈。據官方稱：援希方案共需費二億五千萬美元，若獲批准，其中半數將撥充加强希軍維持冶安之用。欲求希臘經濟穩定，須先制止該國內戰。衆院外交委員會主席伊東則稱：美國援助希臘之舉在我國歷史上影響非常重大。</p>
<p>英美會商即將結束</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社雅典七日電〕關於英美兩國在經濟上援助希臘一事，頃據此間負責人士談稱：兩國進行談判，會商此事，業已吿終，但現尙有一問題，此即英軍撤退後由美軍接防，扣或英軍至蘇聯出巴爾幹半島之後再撤退，　　解決云。</p>

<h3>美託管前日委治島事　各國意見未一致　蘇提三項修正美已接受兩項</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖七日電〕美國受智太平洋內前日本委治島一項計劃，今已因蘇聯向安理會提出修芷建議而失望，並又引起新爭執，蘇聯代表建議安理會有修改託管協定定之權，美代表奧斯汀當即表示美國不能接受此項計劃，主張美國與安理會應先行協商，經同意之後，始予修改。此外蘇聯所提出之兩項修正案。奧斯汀則表示接受，其一為美國應使各該島嶼人民走上獨立之途，第二為准許美國可將各島作偽美國之一部份土地加以管理。英澳代表對此則仍主張在簽訂對日最後和約之前，美國不得加以接管，英代表賈德聯表示俏多數同意，則亦不表反對。澳代表哈斯勒克則主張太平洋其他各國，如紐西蘭，印度等亦應有參加討論之機會，並謂：最佳辦法可設立聯合國特別委員會，加以詳細之討論，結果因英　蘇三國意見歧異，未獲決議，至此安理會即行休會，延期至下星期三繼續討論此一問題。</p>
<p>我國支持美國立塲</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖七日電〕關於美國要求託管太平洋内前日本代管島嶼一事，頃由聯合國機構安全理事會賡續予以討論，中國代表郭泰祺博士首先發表演說稱：美國提議將太平洋內加羅林羣島，馬紹爾羣島，馬里安納羣島等前日本代管島嶼交付美國託管，中國政府對此表示贊同，且願為其後盾。本人認為安全理事會有權就此一問題採取決定，毋需等待對日和約之簽訂。太平洋島嶼在軍略上具有非常之重要性，美國僅要求予以託管，並未要求將其完全歸併或管制，本人對此深表贊同。</p>

<h3>德國問題　歐洲和平的關鍵</h3>
<p>德國問題現為歐洲各戰敗國問題中唯一未經解決者，美蘇英法四國不久即將舉行外長會議，開始討論。本文叙述德國目前的景象，足供關心世局者的參考。</p>
<p>四强當前所面臨的德國問題，乃是和平問題中最為艱難的一個。不管怎樣，歐洲的前途總是和德國的運命相聯的。蘇聯和西方國家如果要能够和睦相處一他們必需能够在德國問題上意見一致。</p>
<p>常各國的外交部長商討德國問題的討論程序的時候，他們一定要考盧到波茨坦會議之後，德國所遭受的變化，德國與各大強國關係的變化。波茨坦會議會經確定調節四强佔領德國的種種規律，但事實上則形成了德國和平的方案。</p>
<p>今天的德國，看來已和第三帝國崩潰時的德國不同，它這次遭受的打擊遠較上决為巨，這實在是影經歐洲復興的更重要因素。勝科者佔領德國所費的代價與經騐，似乎還不足使他們得到敎訓，而如果他們仍舊要貫澈原來計劃的話，他們一定得付相當的代價。</p>
<p>對德目標　四國互異</p>
<p>四強之間的關係也非毫無變化，剛剛勝利之後，四強很難取得協調，但很少人預料到利益與原則之爭會深刻得足以引起全世界新的分裂的，而對德國和約又尙未簽訂。</p>
<p>在德國，每個佔領國家都在追求自己的特殊目標而不顧波茨坦決定的一般原則。例如，法國偏重於分割一部領土，蘇聯着眼於賠償，英國重視魯爾工業區的復興與控制，美國則努力於消滅納粹主義，在每個佔領區裏，這種各自為政的方法使德國無所適從。</p>
<p>今天的世界巳經和戰爭剛剛停止時的世界不同了，國內問題的爭執和不安，已經在英國，法國；美國發生，沒有一個人從戰爭得到了一點他所希望的東西，也沒脊一個政府相信戰爭的影響，正相當於戰爭應該造成的革命性的改變。</p>
<p>最近德境佔領區美國軍政府副主席克萊將軍曾經抨擊德國反納粹法庭的缺乏勇氣和現實的觀點，因為它們常常先處理不重要的案件而擱置重要罪犯的審判。</p>
<p>但是現在也還有機會使四强對於德國協定不致如全世界畏懼的那樣困難，而且迄今為止的協商也還令人如此希望。</p>
<p>柏林的監軍管制委員會究竟還是四强重要代表經常保持接觸的地方，一年半以來，他們是在一個實際的基礎上互相周旋，這種周旋雖然緩慢，可是，漸漸地他們終於接近了一項共同的意見，這就是，分區制度已經失收了，德國統一管理不可。</p>
<p>佔區統一　亟待解決</p>
<p>現在法蘇兩國對於分區管理制度還沒有承認，但是實際上四個國家都巳經準備在協商的某一階段中，承認除非德國具有完整組織而有中央政府，否則進一步的處置實不可能。因此，分區的統一乃是討論的第一個目標，這項目標如果能贏得法國以外的三强同意，那麼第一重難關就可以越過了。</p>
<p>這個發展的重要，由於它是經騐的總結，分區制是解除德國武裝和完成德國軍事政治失敗的猛烈手段；可是作為一項和平時期的方法就不能够使大家獲得利益了。例如，蘇聯就發現為了維持相當的經濟生活水準，不能不使作為賠償用的生產加以縮减，西方國家就發現為了購買糧食而不得不將一部份可充賠償的生產物資輸出。這種分區制不僅分化了德國，同時也分化了各個盟國政府。</p>
<p>一年半來佔領德國的經騐，使得大家已經明瞭：德國問題是不能孤立而求解決的。比利時，荷蘭與瑞士，過去以相鄰的德國為主要的貿易收入來源，現在則德國變成了一個救濟地區了。法國人堅持他們需要得到薩爾區和萊茵，這不僅是為了安全的理由而且是作為避免和德國同遭深陷泥沼的預防堤岸。捷克人怨恨他們失去了蘇台德區了，因為他們同時失去了技術與工人，也失去了德國的市塲與物資供給的來源。至於義大利，曾經有一個時期他們百分之五十的對外貿易都是和德國進行的。</p>
<p>由於這些情形，許多因素就互相影響着，而魯爾區煤礦生產減少百分之六十則是這次戰爭對於歐洲影響最大的經濟恐慌。戰後最大的諷刺是：許多車輛無法運行，許多家庭無法取暖，原因是由於留下來管理煤礦的德國人太少了。</p>
<p>在這個世界之中，德國已經兩度發動戰爭，而每一次都是動員了全世界許多最强大的國家才將它制服，但這一次它是眞正地被打敗了，看起來它似乎難在最近再發動另一次的戰爭。</p>
<p>在戰爭期中，許多戰後的設計家曾經以為歐洲可以無需德國的參加而予以重建，有許多高級人員認為德國應當祗維持一個「肥皂與廚房」的經濟情况，並且驅逐它的軍隊來從事建立曾被德國軍隊破壞的地方，一般的原則是這樣：如果我們能使德國的工業被分配到其他國家並使其他相鄉的國家較之德國本國的工業為多，一定就可以使歐洲大陸的經濟趨於穩定而同時也可以使全世界較爲安全。</p>
<p>德國仍爲歐洲重心</p>
<p>可是問題却在這裏：降低了德國的生活水準，同時也就降低了歐洲的水準。在四强的監視之下。它可以繼續處於一個囚犯的地位，但是它仍舊是歐洲的重心，而且我們也沒有辦法使他脫離蘇聯和西方國家間的戰略地位。由於這一個歐洲的地理形勢，歐洲的復興首先要使德國復興，東西雙方也應當在德國建設和平，因為，如果我們不能在德國建設和平，那麼我們也就不能在其他任何地方樹立和平。</p>
<p>今天各國外長準備開始正式討論德國和的問題的時候，我們不能忘記十八個月來，德國四個佔領區主席曾經不斷地努力覓求細節的安排。</p>
<p>因為這個理由，柏林現在已經變成了歐洲最富興味的首都，不但由於它是我們試騐佔領方法和佔領政策的所在。而且也由於它今天已經成了一個曾受戰爭破壞而幾於同到原有的沙漠狀能的城市。</p>
<p>沙漠上總歸要有東西生長出來的，破壞正是某一種新建設的　礎。假使現在有某些力量，能够超渦分割的趨勢，並且在將各個部份努力拉到一起，那麽必定會有另一些力量或者從事破壞或者從事建設。</p>
<p>六千萬個人，不可避免地是將要合在一起的，尤其是在今天人口過多的德國。</p>
<p>一年以前，我們可以說這裏並沒有德國這個國家，當時他們還是一堆消極的人民，祇想滿足一般動物所有的食物與住所的慾望。雖然他們的健康情况還好，但是無疑地是戰爭和敗績不僅毀滅了城市和工廠，同時也毀滅了復興重建的工具和能力，今天是旣沒有重建的物資又沒有重建的人力。</p>
<p>今天德國表面上的情形雖然沒有變化，而且全部土地仍然被分割成四個部份，但是現在沒有一個人，尤其是四個軍政府裏的人員，敢說目前並沒有一個德國存在。</p>
<p>四強協議　最關重要</p>
<p>在德國四個佔領區襄的投票的情形，以及人民投票的一般趨勢，都反映了德國和其他人民投票可獨自由的國家的政治動向完全一樣，德國人民是歐洲的大陸上最大的，密度最高的和意見最和諧一致的。這便使德國强大而具有危險性的原因。德國現在是很技弱的，然而仍舊具有可怕的危險性。德國是歐洲不可分離的一部份，如果德國採用聯邦制和放取地方分權制，將使歐洲也趨向於聯邦組織。現在趨向於團結的力量已經在人民中間强大起來，而在政府之問則較爲薄弱，這是西部佔領區許多　國領袖提出的解決方案之一。這些領袖都是暫時的，第二次的選舉將比較第一次選舉能够說明眞實的情况，但是在東部與西都的交通建立以前以及外國政治控制放鬆以前，人民眞正的趨向是不會表現出來的。這趨勢的方向，從毀滅中再生的德國將是怎樣一個　國，主要將由四强協議的條件以及四强間關係予以決完。</p>
<p>柏林的一個德國基督民主領袖說：我們的一個希望乃是德國問題不致使蘇聯和西方列張分開。但是　國的前途將不全由征服者來決定，即使在分割的狀態之下，德國本身將是參加決定的一個因素。德國不是一個四方面的問題而是五方面參加鬥爭的問題。每一個人都帶荊興奮的心性注視一切的發展，因為歷史的下一章已經開始。（美國新聞處—譯自「紐約時報週刋一）</p>
<h3>邱吉爾動議　不信任政府　工黨內部不一致</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦八日電〕艾德禮首相今日又遭遇工黨議員百餘人「叛變」，若輩要求將現有兵力百餘萬人，减至半數，以便增加國內勞工人數。同時保守黨領袖邱吉爾要求下院壁工黨社會主義化工業復興案投不信任票，從而推翻工黨政府。叛變之工黨議員前曾對貝文外相所行政策表示不滿，與邱吉爾所提彈効案並不沆　一氣，艾德禮已允於下星期一工黨預選會聽取其意見。英國自由黨議員一向擁護現政府之外交政策，下星期討論經濟政策時，則將贊助保守黨彈効案。自由黨在下院共有議員九人已簽署動議，嚴厲指賣現政府不善處置工業危機。</p>

<h3>黃漢樑抗傳不到　地儉處簽發拘票　賀其燊等回京報告查賑經過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中興銀行　事黃漢樑違法賣買金鈔一案，自警備司令部將全案移送地檢處後，承辦檢察官曾數度發出傳票，黃迄未到案，故已於日前簽發拘票。聞黃早已離滬遠避，地檢處如短期內不能拘到，將考慮通緝矣。</p>

<h3>指數若不恢復　社會將失安寗　十議員連署提請解凍　激辯後交社委會審查</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日參會大會上，為討論解凍生活指數問題引起一塲激辯。該案係水祥雲議員所提出，並由周學湘，陸蔭初等十人連署，擬請轉呈中央，自本年四月份起，重行恢復工人生活指數。其理由為：旣漲之物價已使工人不勝負荷，資方之積存原料與成品又適成一反比例。如物價繼續上漲而生活指數目一月份起凍結，於情於理諸多不合。現雖有六種生活必需品質物差額之補貼，然手續旣感麻煩，分配尤欠公允，不僅工人反響甚大，抑且廠方如中國工業協會上海分會亦表反對。長此以往，若不恢復生活指數，糾紛必多，非但影響生產事業，更將使社會失安寗。水祥雲並補充意見稱：生活指數之編制，包括五十四種物品，現差額祇照六種計算，其他四十八稱漲價，工人並未獲得差額貼補。旦二月份凡以生活指數計算者，一律貼補七萬三千元，技術高抵者並無差別，如此不能獎勵工作效率，優秀工人乃有工作懶惰現象。此法令雖為中央頒佈，但如行不通，參議會有建議中央作修正之必要。</p>

<p>以上四幢房屋，包括住戶十八家，當昨晨十時，房東喬源泰木器號，派小工四十餘人，隨同法幣前來執行時，此十八家之住戶均被逼將傢具搬至路傍人行道上，同時小工並將屋頂抆通，迫使房客無去重行選　入。後由住戶代表向地院請願後，始於下午三時停止執行，但已門窗盡除，僅成一輸廓而已。</p>
<p>至深夜記者前往視察時，住戶尙多棲身地處，　躅街頭。而破爛之傢具，亦仍凌亂堆儲街上。據住房聲稱：當拆屋時，有一二三四號中之產婦董瑞仁，曾為屋頂落下磚瓦，擊傷頭部。又稱：「吾等必將赴參議會請願」。查參會二次大會前日正熱烈討論維護房客租賃權一問題，而於並不冷僻之中正東路，竟即有此不幸之事件公然表演，而為美國記者攝入鏡頭，實屬遺憾。</p>
<h3>鷄若完了　何來鷄蛋　副議長如此說</h3>
<p>副議長徐寄廎聞言表示意見稱，政府因經濟將臨崩潰，乃以緊急措施方案急救，欲以政治力量抑平物價。生活指數之編製雖包括五十六種物品，但其中甚多並非必需。此次凍結後，以米　油糖煤球棉布六種日用主要必需品之市價差額補貼，其所定價格多可買到貨物。如下月再漲，差額還有補。政府在恐慌時定出此種急救辦法，望各界加以擁護。否則鷄完了，便絕對不會再有鷄蛋產生。望大會對此案能鄭重討論，不偏袒一方。</p>
<p>徐寄廎大聲疾呼（本報攝）</p>
<p>物價高漲　誰所造成</p>
<p>工界參議員章祝三起立稱：物價高漲推波助瀾之責，是工人工資造成還是由商人造成？今將生活指數凍結，離開實際要求，社會是否能安定？且根本問題係生活指數影饗物價，抑或物價影響生活指數，不應判明。周學湘謂：此次指數凍結後，對工人之配給辦法，不論係技術工人及普通工人差額貼補相等，認爲不甚公平。</p>
<p>周學湘發言時神態（本報攝）</p>
<p>社會安定　須靠合作</p>
<p>費樹聲則稱：緊急措施為應付非常時期，此在無辦法中仍不失為一好辦法。政府對仕農工商一視同仁，並無差別。吾人試看工人之工資與戰前相較如何？再看現今公敎人員之待遇如何？社會安定須靠各階層合作，如祗工人生活解決而公敎軍警人員之生活未得解決，則社會仍不能安定。如今祗欲求其差額補貼之是否準確與合理，並求其手續之便利即可。</p>
<p>陶百川提議　凍結解凍案</p>
<p>陶百川隨之朮發表意見稱：此一問題重大，兩方皆有理由，本人建議不付表決，而將此欲求解凍生活指數之提案「凍結」，延至下决大會討論。因政府所頒方案為整個，凍結生活指數祗其中一部，今欲推翻，無異一大皮球洩氣，整個方案將遭破壞。如該方案不能挽救經濟危機，二三月後自吿失敗，自不能漠視工人生活之困苦，則「窮則變，變則通」，定有合理解決。李華繼之老大聲疾呼稱：以勞力換得工資之代價為應得權利，故要求解凍。陸蔭初謂：政府緊急命令下來，工人固應咬緊牙關忍受，但須注意一點，即物價有吾抑平？此點漏洞應建議中央加以修正補救，袁召辛亦主張解凍。</p>
<h3>二次大會閉幕　議長市長致詞　希望量入為出　前途尙有三難</h3>
<p>第二次大會舉行休會儀式，行禮如儀後，由主席潘議長致閉慕詞，略稱：本會第二次大會最重要議題為市預算，為審慎及兼籌並顧起見，中間延會二月，調查視察市府各局及單位情形，並由預決算會審核，求得合理之決定。在此物價高漲時期，即能確定數難保本年內一切絲毫不變，關鍵全在物價。是故，祇能就市民可能負担程度下決定歲入。大會決議些二千四百餘億之歲入，相信市長以及各局局長參加會議者，均能體會參議員之苦心，在量入為出及不妨得必要支出原則下，重編支出預算時，參照我們的意見。</p>
<p>同時，潘議長對全市市民，表示歉意，謂恐不能完全反映或代表其意見，唯信討論議案均在為建設上海市着想，而非專為一人，一區或一種職業着想。最後希望市府在本年度預算範圍內，儘量量入為出，使市民對於本會通過龐大預算不致抱怨。</p>
<p>繼由吳市長致詞，表示代表市府同人感謝市參議會辛勞替市府解決困難，但謂，觀察前途，尙有困難三點：（一）收入雖已決定，然支出亦極需費心。惟決秉承參會意見去做。（二）物價能安定，則不獨澦算可解決，民生亦可解決，望參議會能協助市府設法抑低物價。（三）整個上海安定後始能談其他，在此國家不安定之時，此工作必須由參議員及每一市民共同担負。　　　參議員代表馮有眞致答詞，亦謂同人討論預算非常不易，望市府能將市民血汗所付捐稅，涓滴歸公。詞畢，大會即於六時半散會。</p>

<h3>原提案人　聲明身份</h3>
<p>原　案人水祥雲繼之又作補充，聲明並非以工界身份提此案，而係站在參議員地位說話、閱今日申報知社會部正在擬訂評議工資辦法，故望將此工人之要求反映至中央，於擬訂評議工資辦法時，加以補救。潘議長亦發表意見，認為政府所頒方案為整個，今貿然推翻不大好。為鄭重起見，將該案交社會委員會審查，經多數通過，一塲爭辯，乃吿結束。</p>

<h3>黃伯惠遭狙擊案　地檢處績訊證人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前時報館主人黃伯惠被「狙擊」案，昨日地檢處又傳證人許文華（鄰居），陳鈞幹（曾調查該案之便衣警長），杜國珍，李　坤（兩人皆係警士）到處訊問。</p>
<h3>電力不足數　每日六萬瓩</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕値茲參議會討論本市電荒問題之際，美商上海電力公司已對現狀作有精確之佔計。認為本市目前電力不足之數為每日六萬瓩，而六萬瓩之電力如用於工業，可僱用九萬之失業工人，其收入如以本年一月之指數為標準，每月之工資總和亦達三千九百萬國幣。同時九萬工人之勞力，每月可生產價値二億一千一百萬元之棉布或其他消費品，折合天金計算，亦達一千七百六十萬美元之鉅。値得市民深切注意，即電荒並非暫時之情形，可能延長至三年之上，如發電機無適當之補充時，則電荒且有深刻化之可能性。據最保守之估計，至一九五一年而無補充時，電荒將達十九萬瓩，超過上海今日發電之總量。</p>
<p>本市電力之恢復計劃，大概如下：至本年七月可增加電力三三·〇〇〇瓩，至今年年底可再加一六·〇〇〇瓩；明年度可增加四二·〇〇〇瓩；合計達八二·〇〇〇瓩。惟為機器之保護起見，勢必採用休息制度，如此至少减去二五·〇〇〇瓩之發電量。因此六萬瓩之電荒，並不能完全補足。</p>
<p>値茲舉世均鬧電荒之際，即自今日開始向外國定貨，在一九五一年之前，殆無法正式發鴛。故應付此緊急之局勢，必須採用電廠聯營制度，以消除不必要之浪費與開支。上海電力公司已與閘北·浦東·南市電廠數度洽商，均贊成此項辦法。</p>

<h3>「洋老虎」起解　態度十分鎭靜　到達法院已天黑　偵訊後收押　賬冊等證件移來一蔴袋</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕「洋老虎」埃勃斯公司總經理梅斯伯，昨日下午六時一刻由淞滬警備司令部連同全部案卷證件移送地方法院，由地院書記官長黃先鈺閱卷後，於七時半轉解地檢處，當由値日檢察官全匋，通譯官許少勇開庭偵訊，至八時四十分訊畢，即諭收押。</p>

<p>「洋老虎」梅斯伯解法院　影（本報攝）</p>
<p>梅斯伯抵押地檢處時，雖已下午七時半，地檢處收發室因早聞訊，特留職員唐翼之等守候，警備部汽車到處後，梅自捧被　絨毯一大包及藏有書籍麵包皮鞋毛巾等雜物之旅行袋一隻，從容下車，態度十分鎭靜。告記者稱：彼早於戰前來本市經商，太平洋戰起　美國，於去年八月來滬。至於在我政府公佈經濟緊急措施方案後，仍經營金鈔賣買，彼並不知已犯法，但謂其法律顧間Sellctt律師可代彼解釋。</p>
<p>警備部稽查處發表　破獲偵查經過詳情</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕警備司令部稽查處昨特發表本案破獲及偵查經過詳情如下：稽查處於本月一日接獲確實密報，謂南京路沙遜大厦內一百十八號房間新豐公司內，有一埃勃斯公司，由荷人梅斯伯主持，專事秘密經營業鈔外幣等交易，每日成交款數頗鉅，一切黑市價格，均由該公司操縱，當二月初金鈔發生暴漲時，該公司曾事先有計劃收集美鈔二百餘萬元，從事於投機操縱，此外並經營黑市外匯，一面黑市售出，便利走私入口商人，一面與出口商人勾結，搜購出口所得外匯而後加價售出，此項數字估計佔全市黑市外匯五分之二以上。自經濟緊急措施方案公佈後，該公司仍繼續營業，上報各點，俱有證件賬簿可查，請予查緝取締云云。</p>
<p>稽查處據報後</p>
<p>即以經濟監察團執行經濟緊急措施方案之特定身份，派遣幹部，以合法手續，前往該公司搜查，當塲查獲該公司黑市現金交易憑單黑市外匯賬册等十三本，及當日（三月三日）以法幣一萬四千三百元買進一萬四千七百元賣出之美鈔現款二千一百一十元及美鈔外匯票據六千元，人贓俱獲，該梅斯伯證明為現行犯之罪證確鑿，同時並邀請中央銀行分派外匯審核處稽核徐人驥及稽核處稽核任垓到塲，會同硏究，認為犯罪無疑。繼即查獲贓款美鈔三十四萬五千三百十一元，港幣二萬三千零五十元，菲律賓幣三千三百元，以及黃金三百八十兩。當塲訊據梅斯伯及其他管賬人員等自認違法經營黑市外鈔外匯交易不諱。該梅斯伯並當塲吿知辦案人員謂：「余實犯罪，不敢再事經營，但請酌留解散人員費用以便辦理結束。」該犯等</p>
<p>犯罪旣已證實</p>
<p>乃由稽查處正式將主犯梅斯伯逮捕，並將主要管賬人員葡人巴勃鐵斯泰及保太利亞以及華人出納史久森，邵舜欽等帶部訊辦，一千贓物（美鈔港幣金條等）分裝鐵皮箱兩只，由該主犯自行整封，解交中央銀行保管，其他賑簿等則隨帶至警備部偵查。當夜除訊明華籍出納史久森邵舜欽及葡人保太利亞等，並取具口供，交保釋放外，主犯梅斯伯及巴勃鐵斯泰經復訊供認犯罪無訛，乃予以拘押。至該公司往來賬册文件，經聘請會計師謝春溥，經兩日之研算，確知該公司自二月一日至二月十七日金潮期間，共買進現金外匯美鈔七十八萬八千八百元，英鎊十九萬三千三百四十八鎊，港幣一百五十一萬一千元，葡幣四千一百九十五元，賣出美金五十萬七千六百五十元，英鎊三十八萬零六百三十三鎊，港幣一百三十三萬五千元，葡幣二萬一千五百元。自經濟緊急措施方案公佈後，該公司仍繼續買賣美鈔三十一萬零八百二七元，英鎊十六萬四千三百五十鎊，港幣九萬元，澳幣一千元，賣出美鈔七萬三千一百五十元，英鎊十萬三千零二十三鎊，港幣二十一萬五千五百八十一元，葡幣六萬二千元，澳幣一千元。總計二月一日起之買賣</p>
<p>總數已足驚人</p>
<p>二月一日以前者，尙未計算在内，加此巨大出人，且向法令公佈後，任意超過央行規定外幣兌換率，黑市經營，足證該公司藐視法令，蓄意操縱黑市，破壞金融，事關外僑破壞我國金融法令之特種刑事案件，除巴勃鐵斯泰因賬冊初步審查已吿一段落，故先准予交保外，主犯梅斯伯移送法院依照經濟緊急措施方案内禁止外滙幣券流通辦法第七條懲辦。按第七條之規定為「違者以投機操縱擾亂金融論非，除沒收其幣券及吊銷其營業執照外，並處經理人五年以下之徒刑。」</p>

<p>甲組今日除東華再度逢蘇聯外，尙有市長杯，及丙組決賽等二塲，分別在逸園及晋元公關角逐，逸園門票，大看台三千，中央座五千，下午一時起，在體育館發售。市長杯猶太對善運，上午九時半在逸園，猶太首週輪空，善運初戰遭龍傑毒手，惟龍傑有非註册球員出塲，足委會判善運以一對〇勝，因而晋級，今日相遇猶太，恐難保全。丙組決賽，海關對精武，上午十時在晋元公園，爲該組總決淘汰賽。今日秩序如下：</p>

<h3>足球委員會　解釋決議案</h3>
<p>足球委員會對日前發表之第二十一次常會決議各案，有所補充，並對聯賽規程第二十二條有所解釋。抄錄於後：</p>
<p>（議案）三月一日靑白對鐵路市長盃賽時，中途有鐵路制服員工多人，因不滿裁判判決，竟越籬衝入塲內，呌駡呼打，擾亂球塲秩序等情，實屬有背運動精神，應分函鐵路管理局當局負責制止未來，以維球賽進行，否則暫不予派排該隊之比賽秩序。</p>
<p>（解釋）聯賽規程第二十二條「註册某一組之球員可出席其同隊高級組比賽，但該球員經兩决參加高級賽後，在同季內只准代表高級組球隊出席比賽，不得再行退回」。原爲限制聯賽中球員升降（同一球會中而有兩隊以上參加比賽者）之特定規程，盃賽係用淘汰制，每球隊比賽之决數旣無定，球會之有甲乙組者，自無連帶性關係，况市長盃幼級盃得各別舉行，乙丙組會員均得參加市長盃比賽，故足球委員會第二十一决會議紀錄中，「第二十二條聯賽規程並不適用於盃賽」一案，純係對外之解釋性質，並無更改規程之意義。</p>
<p>鐵路體育會　函覆足委會</p>
<p>京滬區鐵路員工體育會於三月七日覆足委會函略云：對於體育精神運動道德與規章，索向竭力維持與遵守，當日敝球隊球員對被判罰十二碼，當塲未曾有異議表示，在塲觀衆，或以旁觀公正立塲表示，裁判容有疏忽，露於言表，但非敝球隊所可顧問。且當日觀衆數路局員工僅佔什一，亦未有若何不滿之言行，故對於貴會來函所　各節，自未便承認，而關於會塲秩序問題，敝球隊參與比賽時，本運動道德，協同維護，惟會塲秩序之維持，其責任仍在貴會，敝會未便代謀。至若比賽秧序單之編派，權操貴會，非敝會所敢顧問。</p>

<h3>美兵強項不服輸　華聯再戰哥倫布　今晚七時在體育館交鋒</h3>

<p>華聯前晚充份發揮戰鬥力，大李指揮三軍，五虎前呼後應，全隊聯絡默契。哥倫布隊雖係一乒艦之球隊，然而實力之强勁，在滬上番軍中，可謂巨擘，加以身長手快，頭腦淸楚，實爲華聯之勁敵。今日相逢，番軍圖雪前恥，當有更精彩之演出。華聯隊長孔廣益，昨隨綠隊征京，然有任相成，可資接替，不至有所影響。今日燮方出戰陣容錄後：</p>

<h3>上行籃球隊　今赴嘉定表演　雪白青聯女籃球隊同行</h3>

<p>至雪白靑聯在本市係女子首流球隊，以往兩險軒輊難分，相逢時孰勝孰敗，極難逆料。以近况而論，雪白蒸蒸日上；與綠隊有並駕齊驅之狀，靑聯以健將徐偑珍身體不適，不無影嚮，故此次另有舊侶王務醴簡志光助陣，倍增實力，而可與雪白一爭高低。在此表演賽中，雙方旅鼓相常，嘉地人士，必能一飽眼福。茲錄四隊名單如下：</p>
<p>（上行）王宗　·謝廷信（領隊）·李培德·梅必賢（幹事）·周福寬（隊長）·王萬春·許文彬·周懷邦·吳煥沅·程世寗·淩克誠·霍慧明·李華德·沈策。</p>

<p>棉布市况，昨紡建公司照例開售二十支細布，價爲十三萬五千元，較上期掛價低七千元，是以塲中人心平穩，做開十二磅龍頭細布，一度會小至十五萬六千五百元，染織廠有吸進，結果仍爲十五萬八千元，與上日相彷。五福十五萬四千元，彩球十五萬二千元，藍鷄十五萬元，軋軟一二千元。其他色布及士林嗶嘰等，市况均平定。</p>
<h3>食鹽輸日易貨　鹽政局申述三種理由</h3>
<p>關於吾國食鹽輸日，實業界以維　吾國化學工業之理由，對政府有所責難，茲據鹽政當局表示：食鹽輸日之理由有三：（一）爲國內餘鹽謀出路，解除鹽民生計困苦，（二）換取國內需要物資，（三）避免鹽民走私，防礙稅收。至於吾國化學工業界，對此巨量食鹽，事實上暫時無法銷納，故政府不能不作適量輸出。日本如不獲吾國食鹽，亦可自其他方面如紅海。緬甸等地獲得相當鹽量。惟本年鹽產量較預期爲少，常隨時種衡變通，總以有餘轍出爲原則。台灣鹽區亦將有食鹽三十萬担，陸續運日，福州已有六萬担，於上週裝輪輸出。</p>

<h3>米市去胃仍呆　粉價步代少受主</h3>
<p>昨米市南北到源共計一萬一千石左右市銷仍呆。粳米逐步下游，中下南北粳均見續跌一二千元。秈米交易淸懈，疲乏之局。白元平定，陰元提高殺次。</p>
<p>油市社局嚴禁市塲不得超過議價，故市塲做開、僅淸油成交略挺三五千元，豆油生油聞塲外因靑島來貨稀少，人心堅挺，暗中堅挺之格。豆餅供求兩少，市勢平平。</p>
<p>粉市逐步下降，再低千元，尙少受主，暫難生色。麩皮步跌千元，去化呆木，仍少樂觀。</p>
<p>黃豆客帮本街消化蟬聯，續升一二千元。菉豆回低三五千元，生仁高貨定勞，中次下挫三五千元。芝蔴挺站，赤豆轉堅，仁糧平正。苞米靑島復動，疲而轉挺，回升三四千元。</p>
<h3>糖價略形回升</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢較爲穩定，間有回升。公會劃盤廿二號中砂白十八萬五千五百元。二四組白二十一萬三千至五千元，八期三半車白棧單十八萬八千元，九期同貨爲十八萬二千元，旋降至十八萬元，後復回升十八萬一千元二千五百元三千元。秘　細砂棧單由十八萬五六千元升至七九千元。汕提靑升五千元，以十三萬元至十二萬九千元成交數百包。刁靑升二千元，開百數十包，十二萬六千元，次之十二萬四千元。</p>
<h3>工商輔導處調查　兩種工業原料　硬脂酸與沉澱炭酸鈣</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自我政府採行輸入許可制後，本市工樂原料之供應，亦受影響。工商輔導處爲特派風赴各廠實地調查各種工業原料之產銷情形，俾便積極推進工業原料自給計劃。茲該處業巳調查硬脂酸與沉澱炭酸鈣兩種，特摘誌其調查經過如次：</p>
<p>硬脂酸：本市多用作臘燭，化妝品，潤膚膏等原料。本市每年用量，計化妝工業二五〇噸（合五千担），橡膠業一五〇噸（合三千祖），製燭業三〇〇噸（合六千担）。惟現以製燭業停頓，故實際用量，祗八千担。目前本市產製硬脂酸之工廠僅一家，全年產量爲七千二百担。惟目前實際產量，實僅半數。如實行擴充，則在三個月之內，可增加產量至一萬二千担，足供全國之用。亟望政府能予輔助，則硬脂釀之產銷題問，可以解　。</p>
<p>沉　炭酸鈣：本市以供橡膠，及化妝品工業應用爲大宗。本市橡膠工廠七十二家，每月需用橡膠一七三九五噸，但實際用量，不及一千噸。外埠橡膠川量以一千五百噸計，即每月沉澱炭酸鈣用量爲二千噸，每年爲二萬噸。化妝品工業每年應用沉澱炭酸鈣一千六百噸，兩共二一六〇〇噸，現價每噸五百萬元，總值一千零八百億元。本市炭酸鈣製造廠共有五家，每日可製廿四噸，每年約七千二百噸，僅合總消耗量三分之一，故有積極擴充之必要，俾便產銷平衡。又查該業需要平價白煤，及充份之電力，同時應限制外貨之進口，俾便刺激該業生產力量。</p>
<h3>華茶二五〇萬磅　准許輸往英國</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦七日電〕據此間華茶進口商估計，當局核准在本月底進口之華茶二百五十萬磅中大部分均已購就，許可證不久可望發出，以便繼續輸入華茶。</p>
<h3>外銷茶成交稀</h3>
<p>外銷英莊注視之紅茶，昨日市上仍因賣買雙方能度欠協，成交猶稀。綠茶花色，自本市出口行商，得悉一部份多年之陳貨，以品質較次，不受國外歡迎後，刻下亦不願問鼎，是以市况轉趨寂寞，但目前對於卅四年及卅五年度綠茶，則頻思活動，所惜給價未能如買主之願，致雙方談商，結果大都未獲圓滿，交易極爲平庸。全市祗僅午昌，大德昌，華茶等公司尙有扒進，市勢依然站住。內銷紅綠茶終鮮幝聯，人心缺乏波動。</p>
<h3>電泡市價砌升</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據電料商穩：電泡因鎢絲來源吿斷，物料人工頻頻上漲，市况上屬甚烈，220V40WGE每只一萬五千元，亞浦耳一萬四千元，華德一萬四千元，220V100WGE每只四萬元，亞浦耳二萬五千元，美貨ATLAS每只四萬元。</p>
<h3>桐油到源不絕　市況穩中帶俏</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕週末桐油交易，仍有小量做開，產地到貨，仍絡繹而來，行商收購到貨，每担自三十八萬至四十萬元不等，此於折光率有關。外銷足度白油，出口商進購價無桶每担四十四萬元，速桶則照加二三萬不等。桐油行商門售零聽每担價四十二萬元，（非足度）頂西洪吉盈豐久無到貨，無貨無市。八三市斤桶裝副西洪每桶卅九萬元，洪江桶油每桶自二十五萬至廿七萬元，鄉銷轉活，穩中帶俏。</p>
<h3>染料頻頻下挫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕二週以來，染料市況之鈍，為半年來所未有。據業中人稱：華北銷路，已吿婁絕，內地客銷，復以存底旣豐，市價時間之利患負荷甚重，運費之昂貴非常，故吸胃毫無，交易淸寥至於極點。週末市況，大橋硃每聽爲二〇萬元，海同棕六萬五千元，五馬硃每聽卅五萬元，BNC元靑　聽九萬元，十六號地字灰每　卅六萬元，均較上日下挫頗多。</p>
<h3>腸衣市況衰頹</h3>
<p>腸衣價格，因國外頻頻報鈍，而廠商產製成本高昂，貨價無法壓低，邇來洋行吸胃懈淡，市况頓轉衰頽，聞腸衣廠商擬請平抑鮮腸收價，以减成本，腸衣業如能做到减輕成本，則每年之輸出額可達八千五百桶，依照目前紐約現價，可得五千餘萬美金。</p>
<h3>油商業公會　今日開成立大會</h3>
<p>本市汕商業同業公會、自奉令籌備以來，瞬已逾月，申請登記入會者頗爲踴躍、總計已達全市油商十分之七以上，並經籌備委員會議決定本月九日在民國路會所舉行成立大會，依法選舉理監事云。</p>
<h3>煙煤愈盤愈低</h3>
<p>煤市白煤售價仍爲貨主極力扳持，故過程始終平穩，烟煤承前趨勢。市價愈盤愈低，尤以烟煤屑跌勢最慘，基隆屑喊六十萬元尙缺受主。</p>
<h3>呢羢進出漸狹</h3>
<p>呢　毛貨受種種環境關係，最近二旬以來，絡續步漲。目下市貨流通漸少，廠方生產艱缺，進口行商受暫禁進口，與外匯調整及再限制之打擎，俱陷於伴頓狀態。同業商號因此進貨不易，售出扳俏，居奇者多。中西衣料之實銷去路，遠較往年春季爲减遜。因是目今與未來之呢羢進出，可稱潮入狹路矣。</p>
<h3>進出口聯鎖之利弊</h3>
<p>關於進出口聯鎖制詳細辦法，市商會定於本月十日在該會召集各有關團體開會討論，進出口商業同業公會現正草擬該辦法意見，並已通知各同業，屆時前往參加討論，該會秘書周經爲頃對記者分析進出口聯鎖制對於該同業之利害如下：</p>
<p>（一）上年度來，吾對外輸出貿易，由於成本與國外市價未能平衡，業務無法展開。而輸入方面，倍形增加。蓋戰後各種工業原料，需要殷切，成品消耗亦大。戰前工業製造成品，採用外國原料，僅摻夾一部份，其餘原料，仍多採用本國產品。但近年來因內地運輸不便，且經八年來抗戰之損失，若干原料產量銳减，是以價格多有反較外國爲高者，因之採用洋貨數量，日益增加。當局供給外匯，在此鉅額入起情形下，自感難於應付。而各同業自輸入管理政策推行以來，所受束縛允深，業務幾階停頓，故應採行進出口聯鎖制度，俾資維持。</p>
<p>（二）聯鎖制固為進出口業自由貿易之捷徑，但過於放縱，則又易引起競爭。結果輸入輸出必趨貨湧價跌之一途，而同業中資力較厚，電訊靈通者，則又可從中操縱　斷。故此項聯鎖制施行辦法，尙須於不寬不緊之措置下，方能有所收益。</p>
<h3>協助翻砂等工業　二批生鐵洽購中　運滬價較現貨為低廉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕工商輔導處機電組，爲協助機器·翻砂·及電工器材各工業，解決原料困難，近正積極爲各工業洽購低價之生鐵與焦炭。生鐵一項，除早於本年一月間，向重慶大渡口兵工署洽購七百餘噸，按每噸九十四萬元之價格，供給各工業應用外，近又與華北鋼鐵公司洽購二批生鐵，聞此次洽購經過，除高矽鐵缺貨外，其他一號生鐵，有存貨四千噸，每噸價爲一百〇五萬元。二號生鐵亦有存貨八千噸，每噸價爲九十八萬元，以上係在秦皇嘉或塘沽碼頭交貨。百噸以上，每噸可减五萬元。定金先付七成，餘待裝船時付淸。小量定貨，接定金後十五日內在碼頭交貨，大量則須在卅日內。述費方面，每噸光交卅萬元，多退少補，在裝船前七日電匯。聞該項交易價格有效期間，暫以十日爲限，（按維持至三月十五日爲止。）依該項交易條件觀之，則該批生鐵之抵滬價，實較現時本市生鐵市價低廉多多。聞該項交易，現正進行接洽中。又該處會於本月初，洽購焦炭一批，計約一百六十頓，業已以每噸七十萬元之價格，供機電各工業應用。聞該項焦炭市價，每噸約在一百八十萬元至二百萬元之聞云。</p>

<h3>莫斯科會議前奏　記倫敦外長代表討論事項</h3>
<p>— 三月一日航訊　本報倫敦特約記者撫松</p>
<p>三國外長太忙，加以見面匆匆會談，爲時有限，因此，在莫斯科聚苜以前，先各派代表，在倫敦商談，由他們在千頭萬緒裏，抽出一個端緒，作爲三巨頭會面討論的張本。代表會議自一月十四日，在倫教召開，一開巳六週，二月二十三日結束，把報吿送交外長。六週間，他們上午討論德國問題，下午討論奧國問題。英國代表兩名：一位是霍特爵士，（Lrd　Hood），出席商談有關奧國的問題，一位是史屈倫爵士，（Sir　William　Strang），出席商談有關德國的問題。美國也有兩位；克拉克將軍，（General　Mark　Clark），專管奧國問題，英飛，（Mr．Robert　Murphy），專管德國問題，法國却只一位馬非爾，（M．Couve　de　Murville），蘇聯也僅一位格色夫，（Mr．Gusev），出席兩個會議。</p>
<p>會議旣開，各小國紛紛要求參加，送去的書面備芯錄頓時堆積如山。英國的各自治領，一致認爲巴黎會議已有大小國之爭，一錯不可再錯，此次對德宣戰十八國，應全有參加及發言的機緣。此荷兩國，受德國之罪極深，如今反被摒棄於門外，自然憤憤不平。各派人竭力要求發言權。</p>
<p>中國送了備忘錄</p>
<p>我們中國並未派員前去陳述理由，只送去備忘錄一份，重申王部長在法所言，要對德和會，中國也參加出面召開。記得代表會議召開之日，各英國報記者紛紛探聽中國是否有備忘錄，或是是否要派員陳說意見，當時中國未有動靜，待備忘錄送去。各報對中國所提，却又一字不提。代表會議中對最後是否再要開像巴黎和會一樣的對德和約大會，也頗多意見。小國認爲如果在準備利的期間，儘可能讓小國參加發言，那麼，最後大會，只是簡短的，形式的，可以省却對義和會時的唇槍舌戰，和類似宣傳戰的種種演說。英蘇認爲無論外長會議的決議是否爲最後決定，至少要召開一次和平大會，以作結束，美國却對此沉默。如果莫斯科會議決定遷和的大會也不召聞，那麼，我們的備忘錄，就完全要失去對象了。</p>
<p>小國抗議生效力</p>
<p>小國的抗議和力爭，畢竟發生了相當效力。在討論對德和約的議事日程時，就有法國代表提出三項原則：第一，是起草和約，當然以四國爲生。第二，是其他各國的參預之權，應較以前對義等五小敵國和的時爲大。第三，一面因爲小國參加，一面也不要因此助長了外長會議的困難。</p>
<p>至於如何使小國參預之權可比上决爲大，法國也有建議：一方面各小國儘可派人去外長代表會議裏陳說，一方面再組織一個諮詢情報委員會，由四大國和「有關國家」代表組成，以供外長會議的諮詢，同時也可向外長會議貢獻意見。在波茨坦協定時，原規定在外長會議討論有關某國之問題時，可請此「直接有關一之國家參加。但對「直接有關」的定義，又如何下法呢？四位外長代表，見解各各不同，最後接受了蘇聯代表格色夫的建議，凡與德國爲比鄰，或凡曾爲德國所佔領之國家，爲「直接有關」國家，這定義雖然勉强，但沒有一個定義比這個更好，只好通過。泰晤士報說，這樣一來，就是阿爾巴尼亞反能出席討論，而對德作戰中功勛卓著的加拿大，反而無份。在我們中國看來，旣未被德國佔領，又遠處遠東不和德國爲鄰，這委員會也就無份。英國美國則贊成十入國　可參加。至今這還是懸案，大槪要呈三巨頭決定。但無論如何，四國代表一致默認對義和約起草的錯誤，所以一致主張各有關國家可儘量發表書面陳述，凡討論到有關那一國和德國的問題時，那一國應該被邀出席，譬如德荷問題，荷蘭就應被邀發表意見。</p>
<p>兩個未决的難題</p>
<p>小國該參加到如何程度是四國代表中第一件意見紛歧不能決定的問題，第二個問題是德國的國體問題，比，荷，希，巴西，加拿大，南菲，新西蘭，盧森堡主張德國將來應是聯邦或邦聯制而南斯拉夫，波蘭，捷克，白俄羅斯，烏克蘭，挪威却主張要維持德國的政治統一。主張聯邦制的認爲只有分散他的集中機力，才能削弱德國的侵略力量，而主張政治統一的，認爲使它分散反激　他的大德意志主義，反助長它的侵略慾望，還不如　它統一，倒反容易控制得多，兩種說法，雖各趨極端，但目的都在防德國來日或有的侵略，兩種意見，也已呈外長會議。</p>
<p>德國聞題，就是這粗枝大葉的兩大主幹，至於奧國，最傷腦筋的是南斯拉夫要南奧一塊土地的問題，南斯拉夫自對義大利要求的港事失敗後，這次似乎破釜沉舟，大有不達目的不休的模樣，一定要南奧一塊名呌卡琳撒（Carinhia的地方的那裏住的大都是斯洛夫人，十二至十三萬，）德國人只有六萬，在人種和戰略觀點出發，這塊土地應歸南斯拉夫，這位南國代表飛爾佛博士（Dr．Vilfar）侃侃長談，但英國代表說一九二〇年那裏在國際監視下實行過全民投票，百分之五十一麒歸奧國，四十九願歸南國，道才判給奧國的。奧國的總理斐格爾（Figl）帶着他的外長趕到倫敦，不肯放棄這方圓一千方哩的土地對南國說他的虐待斯洛夫人連稱寃枉，道件案子，也去莫斯科。</p>
<p>還有在菠茨坦協定裏西方國家答應把在東奧的德國資財，交給蘇聯，原則雖定，這次要定一個細則，西方國家認爲這定義應該是嚴格的，這樣才能使許多奥國利益不和德國的魚目混珠，而東方的蘇聯，認爲這定義愈含混愈好，道樣才能享最大的利益，這一點又是爭點。</p>
<p>這上述的不過是犖犖大者，還有成千成百的土地割讓要求，成千萬成百萬的賠償要求，都推在莫斯科待決。目前的問題，比菠茨坦時代複雜得多，也棘手得多，誠如英國經濟學人雜誌說得好：「現在要解決的，非特是希特勒所種下的錯誤，而且還包括勝利國家自已犯的毛病。」</p>

<p>在國家重又回到艱難的深淵，敎育，經濟等一切事業陷入苦悶的窘境的時代，只有有志氣有毅力的人，才能維持與創造地的事業。作爲國防建設上重要一環的空軍建設基礎的篦橋空軍軍官學校，她是訓練航空人才唯一的最高學府，她也在苦難中創造她的前途。</p>
<p>戰前的空校，設備相當完善，房尾也特別多，戰時遭到日敵的懷恨，盡情的破壞，戰後修復匪易，現在他們的學生宿舍，僅能容二十五二十六兩期，二十七期五月間就要來校，宿舍發生了問題，正在改建中。原本在敎育的過程中有通信，轟炸，驅逐，航行等特別的敎室，裏面有很完備的大型儀器，經過抗戰的時期，被敵人毀壞無遺，現在只有在機械上練習，實地敎育了。本來空校是相當優遇的，所以每一間房裏、幾乎都有暖氣設備，現在僅在辦公樓上有暖氣的設備，其他地方沒有了。</p>
<p>春寒料峭　動手開一條河</p>
<p>記者第六度到空校去，正是春寒料峭的時候，他們的暖氣管却並沒有開放。敎育長和其他幾位官佐笑着對記者說：「國家如此艱難，我們怎忍心浪費公帑呢？」他們全體官生士兵，在胡敎育長的號召下，大家勞動服務，結果，把數十畝蔓草荆棘的荒地，變爲平坦約有用之土，全校境內很多道路是官生築的，很多樹是官生種的，很多溝渠是官生士兵所開的。祝樞壽中校指給記者者，這堅强的隊伍，現正又在動手開一條河呢？「雙手萬能」，他們正服膺這一句銘言啊！</p>
<p>廿六期生　學習盲目飛行</p>
<p>他們二十六期的學生羣，正是學習盲目飛行的敎程每個人都很愉快的跨上飛機，英勇地翱翔在天空中，尤其那熟練而以往有戰功的敎官們，他們對於航空如同喝一杯甜美的葡萄酒，有一位敎官吿訴我：「如果一天沒有飛行，那眞難受。」他們已把遼闊的天空作爲他們的樂園，那廣漠無際的空野，他們可以無拘無束的遊逛着。道二十六期的學生，正在進行淘汰的過程，很多學生雖然是很愉快的，但也很緊張的，他們深恐被淘汰，深恐失去了這廣大的空中樂園，所以他們無不小心翼翼的學習着，以期成爲空軍建設中重要的一員。這幾天來，杭州上空，輕快的司蒂曼練習機聲，整日不斷，這就是二十六期學生學習盲目飛行的時候。</p>
<p>飛行史上　看誰適於航空</p>
<p>我曾經拉住幾位官佐談論以何種人適宜於飛行的問題。在世界飛行史上，應該有飛行能量的人，可分爲三個時期：第一期是在第一次世界大戰前，飛機將發明的時候，大家認爲飛行是一件恐怖的事，飛到空中是不是可以安然降落是一個極大的懷疑，所以祗要勇敢，不論身體好不好，都是駕駛飛機的能手。到第一次世界大戰，人們才感覺航空有興趣，又發現除了　備勇敢的條件外，還需要有健康的身體。到第一次世界大戰後，除了　備勇敢和健强的身體外，還須一種航空心理，航空心理　於民族性，歷史，地理，習慣等的條件，有些地方的人他是適宜於航空的，有些地方的人，却是不適宜的，例如廣東瀕臨海洋，又受孫中山先生等的影響，他們自有一種健全的航空心理，所以他們適宜於航空的人很多。現在，美國確定一個人的能否適宜於航空，其最高權力屬於航空的心理學家，其次才是航空醫生。我們中國確定一個人能否適宜於航空，其最高權力屬於航空醫生，航空心理學家實在還是鳳毛鱗角，所以比起人家來還落後一步。</p>
<p>飛機失事　主原因何在</p>
<p>我們又談到最近滬渝飛機失事的原因，其表面原因當在氣候失常，機件修理馬虎，事前檢查疏忽，裝載份量過重等，但其主要原因，當爲航空心理的不健全之故，或許司機前夜有事，或許司機遭逢到新的刺激，或許司機對某種問題的幻想，因此，他不能竭其精力於駕駛上，便會遭逢到空前的慘劇。據一位敎官說：「我們在戰時，即使是氣候失常，也要飛前綫作戰，機件小有毛病，也得要設法飛返原防。當時，我們全部精力集中一處，以故總算沒有辱沒了使命。又如駕駛史蒂曼練習機飛越駝峯的曹朝覺先生，個以現在滬渝飛機不斷失事的事情看來，曹先生能够飛越駝峯，豈不成了神話」？我們瞭然於他們的啓示，今日中國提倡航空運動，鍛鍊健全的體格，果爲必要之途，但養成一種航空心理，也是十分迫切需要的。</p>
<p>展覽會中　確信前途有望</p>
<p>空軍軍官學校的官生們，他們希望記者把空校的情况報導給大家，使大家了解他們。同時，他們更希望更多的智識充實他們，使他們有更豐富的學養。本報應他們之請，特別把時事照片在他們底俱樂部內展覽，全校官生和士兵，以及他們所有的家屬，都來參觀了。後來，胡敎育長（偉克）於本月三日給本報來函中說：「從申報的展覽會中，認識了在苦難中奮鬥的中國」，使記者與本報全體同人興奮而又感愧！另一個熱烈而興奮的塲面呌人難以忘記。我們看到他們那純潔天眞無邪而活潑跳躍的情態，使我們確信中國是有前途的。據負責人吿訴記者：三十四年中國國民黨的黨部已離開了學校，現在要把政治部改去，成立訓導處，完成學校體制，這種種，都證明了空軍軍官學校，她礦在苦難的時代中創造她的前途！</p>

<p>從某友身後說起</p>
<p>昨天，我到一家會館裏去弔一位亡友的喪，覺得景象太凄其了，四壁旣無輓幃之屬，即弔喪的人也寥寥可數，素燭搖搖和家人的哭聲籠罩着凄慘的靈堂。我看了這副光景，也禁不住掉下了幾滴同情之淚。</p>
<p>說起這位亡友，年事還輕，正當有爲之時；服務在一個機關裏。他忠於本身職務，同時他又是一位很知道「奉公守法」的人，不待公家去嚴厲考續，他也始終沒有意荒職守的情事。所以他可以說是一位標準的好公務員。</p>
<p>他家中有老母幼弟，都要靠他一個人負祖生活，地肩架上的担子委實太重了。但他的進益却微薄得令人難以相信，因而他只好自已極力省吃儉用，把有限的收入，儘量供養他的一母二弟。</p>
<p>他的工作旣太煩，譬養又太差，於是身子便在不知不覺中受到虧損。久之產生了炎症。才進醫院裏去，他雖在病中，仍念念不忘他的職守，但病漸漸地沉重起來，終於他的生命，被無情的死神拖走了！</p>
<p>據說他的病本來並非絕對不治的，只因缺乏醫藥費，醫院裏不肯悉心給予治療，而這位朋友在醫院喪死掉後，還欠着一大筆醫藥費，因此在沒有繳淸這一大筆款子以前，醫院方面絕對不容許他的家屬把遺體從太平間搬出，照他家中的情形，偌大的一筆醫藥費當然無法負担，公家雖有規定的撫卹費，但太微小了所以這筆費用連同殯殮的開支，還是由別人以吿募方式向人募捐得來。公務員身世的悽慘，怎不令人哀痛，令人悲嘆！</p>
<p>死者已矣，我想像和這位朋友同樣境遇的公務同志，當然還不少吧。因此，我不能不爲這班公務同志發出痛切的呼籲。我想公務員是爲國家做事的人，似使國家對於這班公務員的生活不能有確切的保陣。非惟像這位亡友將永遠抱恨泉下，即生存着的許多公務同志如何能振作他對工作努力的情緒？這對於國家前途，無疑是會發生影響的。我希望常局能因此篇所述事實，從而對一班公務員的生活遠謀切實改善，那就萬幸了。</p>
<p>長壽路垃圾已出淸</p>
<p>本欄據讀者投長壽路淸潔要求一文，刋出後，茲得上海市衛生局函稱：「飭淸潔總隊調查，據復該處垃圾，因垃圾碼頭船隻遭擱，運輸失常，致星弄垃圾不易淸除，爲澈底淸除起見，故將垃奶集中上述地點，改派卡車移運。查長壽路垃圾，已於二月四日如數出淸矣」。特予登載。</p>
<h3>蘇州公用事業續談</h3>
<p>— 六日蘇州訊　本報特派記者吳守仁</p>
<p>技術困難　廣設公用電話</p>
<p>細看今日的奧縣電信局，雖然在員工服務效率和內務管理上，已經堪稱無要味疵，但有一種技術上的困難，正非常嚴重地在阻遏着蘇州電信事業的成長。簡而言之，就是機械的陳舊：目前所有的交換總機及一部份話機，大多係戰前的舊物，尤其是總機裝置已逾廿年，超過所能負荷的年齡；因此，話機發生障得，實在修不勝修；用戶及技工，都兩感痛苦，電信局對於這一點，盡了最大的努力來挽救；他們厲行淸晨試話和夜晚測綫制度，俾使當用戶還沒有發現話機陣碍時，局方已經從試話和測綫中知道了，就立刻派技工去修理完好，其次則爲交通部所頒行的市內電話限制辦法繼續有效，使地方上需要電話的新用戶，雖然股切盼望裝置，而無法如願以償；陳局長爲了彌補這一種缺憾，特開放了許多公用電話，在人烟稠密，商建櫛比的熱闊地方分別裝置，聊以便利了不少。</p>
<p>電汽事業　僅限電燈一項</p>
<p>蘇州的電信事業概况已經略如上述；次之就是電汽事業。所謂電汽事業目前還僅以電燈爲限；蘇州電燈廠是一個純粹商營的機構，而其規模在京滬綫上是數一數二的。它的發電量是七萬度電，全縣光明的發源，完全仰給於此；但因了燃煤來源艱窘的關係，按月在一日和十五日的兩天，全城停止供給日電，其他日子則劃分區域輪流停電。這在許多自己沒有發電力量的生產工廠，實在是，一種打擊；各方希望改善，然而限於電燈廠實際上的困難，能勉力做到目前的地步，已經是頗難能可貴了。記者曾訪問過他們的負責人，據說現在每度電力的價格，雖平均高至七百五十元；然而每月還是要遭受極慘軍的虧損；究其癥結，最大原因在配給煤的數量太少，祗有二千五百噸左右一月，而實耗量却達四千餘噸，其間一千五百餘噸的差額，就必須完全求諸於市塲，每噸價格達九十萬元；虧損的最大原因，即在乎此。然而，話雖如此說，假使講到同人待遇，在目前蘇州社會中，電燈廠員工是生活比較安全的職業。關於這一點，終算是頗可灣許的成就。</p>
<p>公共汽車　缺點需要彌補</p>
<p>再次需要報導的是城區公共汽車，在去年七月問開辦，當時曾使蘇州各界發生了激烈的爭辯；有的認爲遵是社會交通事業的進化，應該加以贊助，有的認爲目前社會太貧乏，公共汽車的行駛，將使人力車受到嚴重的生活威脅，而使社會秩序趨於不安定；似乎應該從緩。但結果公共汽車終算在大家渴望進化的熱忱下，出現於蘇州各界人士之前了。不過往後又爲了沒有公開招設的問題，引起了激烈的抨擊；然而，沒有多少時候，也就雲消烟散。直至二個月前，又爲了積欠養路費達億元以上，影響蘇州街道逐漸因載重而日趨破壞，却無法動工修築的問題，使地方輿情大表不滿；但時至目前，仍然是毫無結論地緩和下去了。以記者客觀的立塲說起來，公共汽車的行駛，在今日社會交通的需要下，實在是無可疵議的事業；然而，蘇州公共汽車，也有其不可掩飾的缺點：第一是車身乃十輪卡軍所改裝，設備方面太簡陋，而其票價却一點也不便宜。第二是司機的駕駛技能和服務道德都太壞，僅僅行駛半年，而犧牲在巨輪下的無辜者已有多名；被輾傷的慘劇更是經見不鮮；公司方面，往往僅以經濟賠償爲了事的手段。</p>
<p>綜合上述，蘇州的公用事業，實在是太脆弱了，脆弱到爲外鄕人所不易置信的地步。就中僅是電信事業在管理上頗足稱道，惟因如此，我們益覺蘇州的電信事業，責任方面應該傾力培植，讓好的管理能配合好的技術，而爲蘇州整個公用事業放一異彩！同時希望市話限制辦法能够早日廢除，俾使電信事業能充分做到爲人類服務的最高目標。憑心而論，蘇州是一個值得開發的都市，在京滬綫上除上海外，能够擁有一百多萬居民（包括鄉鎭）的富庶之地，能有幾個？我們忍心讓它長此因循落伍下去嗎？</p>

<h3>寫在應野苹畫展前　中國畫是否永存</h3>
<p>— 定山</p>
<p>野苹將開畫展，要我寫篇叙，我說，老生常談我實在寫膩了，我們還是來談中國畫的本身價值　。野苹說好，我們便立了上面這個題目。</p>
<p>中國最高文藝是詩，書，晝，但是近來常要感到一種恐怖的威襲，覺得道「最高文藝」非但沒有復興的希望，而且快要感到覆亡。第一是「詩」這五言七言押韵的詩，在現實社會的環境之下，是否需要？甚至受到一般人的憎厭，說它沒有自由發揮的餘地，而僅使付與幾位抱殘守闕的老先生去呻吟。這一個統系從詩，詞，曲，甚而至於三五七言的「崑曲」和「平劇」，都向沒落的陰影裏走，他越是離開大衆，越是陰暗！</p>
<p>其次是書，就是中國字中國字的美是中國所獨有的日本雖我們同文，却得不到我們中國的美，雖則這字的需要在中國文字使用上還不能拋棄，而在省法的唯美條件却已破壞無餘；不要說書法的本身沒有人肯下功夫去注意，就是寫字的工具「毛筆」也漸漸被鋼筆，鉛筆，以至於原子筆所侵佔，而失去了書法本身的條件　這一種威製的恐怖瀰漫了全國，恐怕不出十年，中國字不但沒大會寫，竟要沒人會認識了。</p>
<p>近二十平來略略還在掙扎和保存的倒還是一國畫」，畫是詩意的組合，而用寫字的毛筆拿來表現的，它沒有「詩」的艱深，和「書一的單調，一般人還能接受，看得到某一個墨潰知道是山和樹，某一塊顏色知道是花或鳥，所以他們比較能欣賞，甚至肯出議去買來掛在自己壁上，標榜一下風雅。所以執筆爲畫者，也就比較執筆爲詩，執筆寫字的爲多，中華民國三十六年之中好像日盛一日，而且每一時期的代表作家，多有一個祖師。在民國初期，盛行吳昌碩，王一亭，捧的祖師是八大靑藤板橋。到民國十午間，張大千等捧出了石濤，梅瞿山；而劉海粟一輩西洋畫家轉習國畫，覺得毛筆作書受不慣拘束，而提倡「叛藝術一，不要祖師，但看到他的現實畫面，仍舊脫不了八大石濤。到了民國二十年以後，吳日碩，王一亭相總作古，張大千搬到燉煌石室裏去畫佛像，沒有主力軍替祖師宣傳吶喊，人們也看厭了在怪的八大派，和紅綠的石濤派，而漸漸回到四王吳憚；直到如今，劉海粟也改晝了石谷，買晝的標準專問馮超然吳湘帆吳待秋諸收藏家方面去搜檢，於是有意無意的一致提倡董巨，提倡四王，不但把石濤八大摒之門外，連文沈唐仇似乎卑不屑道。</p>
<p>展覽會之盛駢肩接踵，一個個展，坐致鉅金，不足爲奇，每個畫家欣欣向榮，以爲追元軼宋，捨我莫屬，甚有董巨關荊不過爾爾之槪。誰知勝利以來，不到兩年，畫家的黃金時代溘然消逝；當年紙貴洛陽的，現在個個門可羅雀。於是大家一致理怨經濟的崩潰，以致欣賞藝術者亦顯的購買力薄弱。晝家失去了生活力，不能彀再有精心的出品，而畫的沒落，也就隨着「詩」「書」同樣覆亡，而眞成爲「三絕」？</p>
<p>其實中國畫早巳亡了，他不亡在民國三十六年，而已亡在淸初。我們仔細把來檢討一下，就可以知道藝術本身的生命泉源，永遠是新的。就把一詩一變到詞，詞變曲，「書」的篆變到隸，隸變到楷，楷變到草，都是向前進。畫從晋唐的人物走獸，變到宋的山水，再由宋的現實，而變到元明的抽象，一直再變到董玄宰王麓臺，完全是一種打草稿的方法在作畫，它永遠在前進；到了乾嘉以後，專創復古，事事以模仿為工，於是「詩」停止在「江西」「西崑」，「書」停止在「趙」「董」，一畫」停止在「四王」，一直到民國「詩」不能買錢，人家不鶴研究，所以先亡了；書除了幾位翰林先生之外，不能買錢，所以也繼績而垂亡，畫還有一班普通社會來買它，却又帶着厭故喜新的態度來檢選他們自己的所好；所以畫家也不得不從毫奄一息之間，來掙扎以趨時，投其所好，於是三十六年間一變再變，終不能逃出古人小小的範圍，而表現到現代氣息垂盡的一幕。</p>
<p>那麼這「畫」中國的國粹究竟是否尚能左在呢？我堅決地說存在，永久存在！但它所存在的是民國時代的創作，而不是荊關董巨，以至四王吳憚的還魂，也像「詩」一樣，以後一種新的創作出現，而不是江西派西崑體所包得了的。</p>
<p>這小小的討論在此結束，而野苹的畫展終於本月五日在寗波同鄕會四樓開幕，他的力量能否給「畫」的永存添上一分活力，我們可以去從他的畫裏面找出魂靈。</p>
<p>我所認識之應野苹　鄭午昌</p>
<p>凡一畫家之成功，初非倖致；必具有相當的學養；——好惡善別·沈思害悟。虛懷善納·技巧善變·——是爲畫學四美。（鄙意如此，幸識者弗以不經相議。）蓋好惡旣別，學有定向，不至誤入魔道。好在何處？如何　致其好？則必加沉思，自生妙悟。妙蹟常有，妙法時現，不限今古朝野，惟虛懷者能得而納之。目有矣，神會矣，若不能應諸於手，如入實山而空回，仍無所得；必具有應變的技巧，方克並擅衆長，人如來地而自創宇宙。</p>
<p>憶十餘年前，野萍與余居相近，得晨夕過從，縱談古今繪事，好惡之別，所見殊高。每　名蹟，目炯炯切視欲透紙背，旋復點頭拍案，頻頻呌絕，其頴悟有過人者。即是市史村童所作，亦必反復審視，覓其好處，嘗曰：道在瓦礫，此中或有奇妙，爲當人所想不到做不到者，其虛壞如沘。每有會心，輒勤手追，務窮其奧而後已。蓋其天資人工，克備四美，故其所作，日新月異，出入宋元。人物花烏魚蟲，無不精工；尤擅山水；於黃大痴王叔明法，所得更深。大痴寓奇偉於平澹，叔明寓平澹於奇偉，此中三昩，而野萍能神而明之於孤柯片石崇峯邃壑之問，無不動人心目，野萍豈今之人哉！近日野萍將展覽其傑作於寗波同鄉會五樓，凡百數十點，識者觀之，常能欣然相頌野萍之成功也。</p>

<h3>吳稚老書　蔣金紫園廟碑</h3>
<p>— 觀周</p>
<p>名書家王覺斯氏有言曰：「書法之始也，難以入帖，終也難以出帖；」世界上文字之夥，人盡知之，而以寫字與繪畫雕刻等同爲藝術者，惟我國爲然。</p>
<p>善繪畫，精書　，功吟咏，是爲三絕，年高德劭之吳稚暉先生能之，或曰吳先生未曾畫也，此蓋未曾見吳先生之畫耳，筆者近於吳先生書架上見其正在著述之原稿一冊，係闡發六書者，其中列像形字五百左右，每一個字均有圖，如雨則繪雨，而雲則繪雲，且敷以色，故吳先生亦能畫也。</p>
<p>近者吳先生所書之蔣金紫園廟碑帖已問世，由呂班路四十號出售，是碑爲淸乾隆三年戊午鄞全祖望撰文，陳布雷先生跋中有云「……抗戰勝利乃請吳稚暉先生補書此碑，命公子經國精選蘇州名手刻石，以垂永久，三十五年夏，刻旣成，吳先生所書眞蹟，不爽累黍，雄勁整秀，以籀隸之意行之，即諭書法，已足千秋。一生爲楷喜，明淸科舉取士，且以此爲取舍，吳先生爲淸朝舉人，兼工篆　，其楷書之優美，字體端正，筆姿挺秀，無庸筆者贊言矣。</p>
<h3>白雲出岫</h3>
<p>— 趙桐蔭</p>
<h3>三家畫展合誌</h3>
<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>最近兩週內有張炎夫·應野苹·朱其石三位畫家，先後在中國畫苑和寗彼同鄉會畫廳，舉行個展，在黃金美鈔的經濟問題，和談改組的政治問題，鬧得天旋地轉的時候，而藝術界人士，還是戛戛獨造地創作，舉行展覽，這不能不算是給沉悶的社會羣衆一劑淸凉散。尤其我們藝術工作者，對此特別感覺興趣。</p>
<p>朱·張·應·都是四十左右的少壯畫家，天分工力，各有造詣，都是我佩服的畏友。炎夫山水是摹擬石濤石溪的，其石是寫黃山的，而野苹則取法各派，並不專聲一家的。所以炎夫在這次畫中，百分之七十以上是二石山水，布局竟境，樹石點苔等都是二石家法，尤其是意境方面，平淡天眞，匠心適意！我所最欣賞他的在乎山石輪廓，雲水漂渺之間，渲染些淺絳和花靑，流利活潑，把山川靈秀樹太華滋的神韵，描寫無遺。倒也不在乎酷肖石濤石漢哩！</p>
<p>野苹山水，近幾年來，把四王做了他的橋樑，從這橋樑通過，一味向文沈黃王進攻，居然給他登堂入室，這不能不使我們欽佩的。這次個展中「羅浮山樵岡」的雄厚，「曳杖看　」的沈着，「潮山消夏」的幽逸，以及「蘭竹」的挺秀，確是得力於吳仲圭趙文敏一流、</p>
<p>明淸以來，很多寫黃山的畫家，黃山有三奇，奇松，怪石，亂雲，都是頂美的粉本，梅擅山便是寫黃山著名的，可是梅民筆墨平淡，氣魄總嫌不够。近人張大千能得黃山三奇的神韵，博得藝林推許。大千以外，其石也是喜歡寫黃山而和大千有異曲同工之妙的。其有兼擅書晝金石，書法從二主入手，參用歐虞黃柳的筆意，俊秀臺放，更和黃山谷相近。金石則取古　，碑陰，秦詔版，銅器等篆隸，所以古樓渾厚，很可和他的書棗相配合。五師蕭屋泉先生嘗論吳昌碩：「畫不及書，書不及金石」，其石却沒有那種缺憾。</p>
<h3>中國畫在歐美——記張雲谷講演</h3>
<p>— 陳麟</p>
<p>中英文化協會最近在南京會所舉行藝術晚會，到英，美，荷，加等國旅京人士百餘人，特請張雲谷敎授演講。費正樂（Fitzgerald）博士主席致辭介紹，略謂張君任敎之餘，致力丹靑，往年舉行盡展於北美，講學於紐約大學等校。張君講演引徵英國詩文，解釋我國繪畫，語多風趣，茲憑記憶所及，譯述數則。</p>
<p>支加哥有富翁顧稱購得中國畫傑作一幀，並盛讚網盡之神秘，色彩之鮮麗，出示衆人。詎所云傑作，乃尋常人家祭祖所用之「祖宗遺像」耳。（據出口商云，戰前我國曾有大批社先潰像出國，銷售美國各城市。）其畫在圖案方面，民俗方面雖皆有其意義。若以之代表國畫，而妄加誇讚，實令人啼笑皆非。</p>
<p>其實歐美各大美術館所藏國畫玲品亦夥，例如倫敦博物院顯愷之女箴圖，波七頓美術館宋代院畫，均名貴非凡。嘗見地德律美術館有元代錢選彩繪秋蟲手卷一長幅，的是精品，非特　致生動，設色尤能逼眞。彼邦生物學家謂秋季之蚱蜢，靑蛙，因時令更轉而色彩變異，俊料六百年前由國畫家之表現精細若此，誠屬難能可貴。</p>
<p>紐約畫展塲中，某决嘗有商人選購中國花烏冊頁，不喜飛翔小烏，獨選肥碩癡鵝一幀。或問其何以捨小烏而選大鵝，答謂所費旣相等，則肥鵝較爲結實飽滿，而小烏究屬微細渺小。觀其語氣，此人或係廚師之流。國畫佈局，最重空靈之感，然而外人之計較錙銖者，其不知逸情雅趣有如此者。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　193</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>屋子內收到這個善報，由耀羣字字念明，連虎城都神完全明瞭了是怎麼一回事，各人的思想，立時起了激烈的反應，都在運用智機，要籌劃一個最適合的應付方式，沒有人搶先開口，所以全室沉寂。</p>
<p>「對不起」，鶴見終於衝破了沉寂的空氣，一面走向W君的巨號寫字檯，一面向W告罪，「我暫且先在這裏借打一個電話」。鶴見話未說舉，W君已經隔着寫字檯，把電話遞了過來。</p>
<p>「喂，……駐平辦事處嗎」？鶴見用日語說話，「嘔，請松井主任說話，……我嗎？……參謀總部鶴見玉……什麼？出行？那麼請酒幷主任說話？……噢？也出行？……哦，上豐台？……開會？好，請秘書室值日主任說話……哼……那麼就請佐藤副官長說話罷……好」！</p>
<p>鶴見說到這裏，把電話聽筒放在懷裏，閉住了傳聲口，冷笑着對我們說，「又在搗鬼了，……也許眞的開會去了」？</p>
<p>W君點點頭，指了指鶴見懷裏一下，鄙，意思呌他注意電話。</p>
<p>「喂？……不敢，鶴見玉……佐藤君嗎？……是……有件事向您打聰一下，鄙人據敝部下報告，貴部，也許是其他特務機關，派了隊子向敝處這裏集中，不明自他們的目標……噢？……不與貴部相干……那麼究竟是誰？……中島還是川島？……哦，中島？……來保護？……笑話，鄙人不敢驚動他們哪！……」</p>
<p>鶴見放下了電話，「弄了半天，還是兄弟的毛病」？鶴見冷笑着，臉上顏色，已經轉變，眞約有些生氣了；「好罷，我應該挺身上前了」！說着，又瞧着我，「岳大哥，咱們看看要走霉運了，連「滿洲的雌狗」也找上來了。……咱們走罷」！鶴見氣提發了孩子脾氣了。</p>
<p>「火急……」本樓警報又嗤嗤響了起來，耀羣趕緊念着：「據伏崗報告，本樓四面已被包圍，出路已斷，……突擊各部，己達西區第二支部，報告己收到，候令行動，……大廳已有接觸……火急……本樓各項，已遵令準備就緒……」！</p>
<p>「大槪大　已有人進來了……」鶴見氣惱得很；因爲這種無名的「保獲」，有傷他的體面，當然裏面一定還有別的作用。「咱們下去罷」？鶴見瞧着我們。</p>
<h3>西洋畫史上的寫實精神　印象派」作家</h3>
<p>— 沈雁</p>
<p>所謂「印象派」的名稱爲批評家對於一八七四年舉行的「無名協會」美術展覽會所起的諷刺性名稱。因爲慕尼在此展覽會出品「印象。上昇的太陽」一作，批評家因此而稱爲「印象作家的展覽見會」。此項名稱後來被公開承認，遂爲美術史上用語。然而慕尼的「印象，上昇的太陽」一作內容實較當時批評家所想更爲深刻，在意義上是代表印象派，並象徵印象派中心人物慕尼的一生。慕尼的繪畫以太陽光綫，空氣色調，水面表現爲主體的藝術。描寫朝霧籠罩在水面，太陽徐徐上昇的此類作品，實在暗示慕尼風景畫將展開的方向。</p>
<p>在此展覽會的十數年以前，慕尼已經與幾個志同道合的作家常聚在一起。至一八六三年他看愛德爾·馬尼的個人展覽會，頗受啓發，而對於馬尼的「草原的午餐」曁「阿蘭比亞」特別子以注目。引起紛紛議論的馬尼此項作品，因龍拉·波德勒爾之辯護，遂受年靑美術家的支持，而此種空氣終於發展而成爲「無名協會」的展覽會。</p>
<p>馬尼是在起初對慕尼雖予以影饗，而後來反受慕尼影響的作家。以畫風景糸統而論，他站在以色彩本位發展庫魯培以來的寫實派的位置。他雖然加入上述美術家的羣，且在一個時期佔在領導地位；惟決不是印象派的作家。他採取所謂「外光派」之製作態度，作戶外寫生，是受慕尼影饗以後。惟馬尼本來就是歡喜外光的明朗與其豐富的色彩。而討厭庫魯培色彩的暗淡的作家。雖屬於庫魯培系統而色彩的用法，正與其相反。因此可說是庫魯培與慕尼中間的作家。</p>
<p>馬尼的畫，無論在畫面的任何一個角落，均滿溢着光明的色彩；如用表示光綫明暗的同一畫法則爲補充顏料本身的光彩的不足，必須將陰影邢份使之特別暗淡。所以如願從畫面除去暗色，必須對於陰影亦賦予豐富的色彩。且在光綫的表現上使用另外一種技巧。此種傾向結果勢必到達印象派的「光綫描寫」。</p>
<p>「印象派」並非有所謂「印象主義」繪畫理論的一派，屬於此一派的作家，均根據各人自己的藝術信念，而進修各人按術。所以雖同稱屬於此一羣的作家，其畫風或技巧則各異。此點於了解印象派特點頗爲重要。亦爲與所謂「新印象派」區別的要點。至於「新印象派」並無健全的寫實精神只爲「印象派一的亞流而己。</p>
<h3>日本二事</h3>
<p>— 勞燕</p>
<p>友人徐君，甫自日本歸，余邀飲某所，順詢彼處近况，伊即談起以下二事，彌增感慨！</p>
<p>日本自前年乞降後，國內政治經濟皆受命於麥帥，是以對輕重工業之剏霞，限制綦嚴，非戰勝國人民不能申請開辦，日人不得已，不惜奴顏膝　，勾引僑居於彼邦之大中華國民，謂能頂名申請，事成而能盈餘，則各午分派，僑胞利其多金，不惜出賣國格，紛紛代彼請求，每月收獲之多，不難想見，麥帥雖洞悉個中弊病，亦不予追究，但對美國人民，則絕難放縱。</p>
<p>徐君左鄰係日本家庭，伊於無聊時輒前往談天，見矮几缺足，安置物件，諸多不便，日半月之久，傾　如故，不覺怪而詢問。曰：「木工無暇！」徐君明見右鄰木匠張某，無事閑游，即以張對。主人答謂：「貴下所薦者係貴國人民，余說無暇者係我們自己匠人也。」</p>
<p>以上二事作一比較，平棄愛用外貨之吾國同胞，閱後不知作何感想！</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>「划龍柴」—海裏淘金記—</h3>
<p>— 天地人</p>
<p>垃圾，上海人以爲討厭的廢物，鄉下人見了，竟是欣喜欲狂，當作珍貴的燃料；因爲際此「薪桂」時代，鎭上不少店家，多以柴價太貴，改燒礱糠等雜物，因此曦乾了的垃圾，便被視作價廉物美的燃料。</p>
<p>從龍華以南，直至寺嘴角一帶。沿浦鄕民，每當潮水退後，男女老小，成羣結隊的前往浦灘，耙取垃圾—他們名之日「划龍柴」，其所用工其，除竹齒耙一把外，用以盛取垃圾的，草籃，蔴袋，蒲包等不一，每次無不滿載而歸。</p>
<p>筆者爲好奇心所趨使，某日特往浦灘實地觀察，但見成羣結隊的「淘金者」，有年逾花甲，個僂聾腫的老頭兒，老太婆，有十歲左右，正當求學年齡的男女孩子，也有年輕力壯的小夥子大姑娘，他們往來於春寒料峭的黃浦灘頭，很緊張的用竹齒耙不停地耙着，一堆堆潮濕的垃圾，故進他們的草籃，蔴袋，或蒲包裏，然後挑回去曝曬。</p>
<p>筆者細看曬着的垃圾中，有稻草，有雞毛，有紥鈔票的橡皮圈，有熱水瓶的軟木塞，也有腐爛的菜根菜葉，以及殘穢的字紙破布……總之竹頭木屑，應有盡有，兒童見之，如入大觀園中，俯伏檢取其玩物，煞是有趣。</p>
<p>垃圾曬乾以後，就挑往鎭上，售給茶館，豆腐店等處，初售每担二三千元，現已遞漲至五六千元一担，且有若干用戶，下鄉收買者；鄕民整日耙取，少則五六十斤，多則二百餘斤，每人每日有二三千元至二萬餘元之收入，在此農隙副業上，不無小補。據謂北風愈大，飄來愈多，但同時也愈寒冷，他們寗受寒風襲擊，却不欲風平浪靜，此種反常心理，可憐亦復可歎！</p>
<p>此種曬乾的垃圾，只限於裝有風箱之廚灶，才能適用，燃燒起來，火力相常强烈，惟以其中雜有不盡可作燃料的雜質，旣不能細加選剔，只得使亂燃燒，以故燃燒時怪聲雜作，奇臭難聞，但一經習慣，也就處之寨然，不以爲異了。</p>
<p>最近報載上海市政會議決議通過撥款四億五千萬元，肅淸全市宿積垃圾，據估計是項宿積垃圾，不下十許萬噸，這許多垃圾，將向何處去呢？旣無垃圾堆棧，又無垃圾倉庫，銷燬嗎？不見得。惟一出路，自然是往大永裏傾，隨波逐流，一任他去，好在「門前雪」掃却了，管他娘的「瓦上霜」！一旦淸除出來，又不知將有多少噸數，經由鄉民之手，代爲銷燬呢！</p>

<h3>台灣事件</h3>
<p>— 劉夢</p>
<p>臺灣事件希望能早日合理地解決，姑不論此次事件責任誰屬，但總希望治理臺灣的大小文武官員們，能把過去錯誤的作風改正過來，實不勝馨香祝禱之至。</p>
<p>因了這次事件，使我憶起抗戰結束後的國人心理來了。我沒有去過後方，但我並不因此後悔，我在淪陷的國土上一直做着對得起國家的事，勝利了，我跟所有淪陷區內的人一樣，鬆過一口氣來，懷着滿　的喜悅，伸善手，期待着熟烈的握手。然而失望了，我們被歧視了。渝陷區　像是一塊帶有可怕毒菌的樂土，淪陷區的人好像在抗戰期問一直享樂着，同時還像帶着可怕的靑菌似的。固然我們用的是儲備票，但儲備票前的法幣，要有四百元才合得上勝利後的一元法幣，不過誰也沒有怨聲。</p>
<p>飛機從後方帶來了歧視：學校，機關……稱種塲合，淪陷區的人簡直就是漢奸！這種心理是錯誤的，以這種心理爲出發點，其作風也是錯誤的。這種心理，作風如果長此不變，分化與騷動是難免的；臺灣事件祇是一個「例」而已。</p>
<h3>秀才訪兵記</h3>
<p>— 氣樓</p>
<p>某月某日，是我們四千五百年相砍史中難得放下屠刀的若干年中的一年。那時天下太平，山東曲阜有幾位秀才，從他們認爲是眞理之樹的一顆梨樹上，摘下了幾頭　兒，要去訪問全國的兵士，向他們宣揚眞理。</p>
<p>他們一共編成兩隊出發，分道而行。現在我們祇說其中一隊的行程。</p>
<p>這批秀才走到邊界，剛要人江蘇省境，却被幾個守墳的兵士攔住了。秀才說「來得正好」，他們正要找乒說話。於是他們拿出眞理之菓來，這些菓子可還沒有熟。兵士們咬了一口，連忙吐出。「這樣酸的東西！」</p>
<p>秀才們從槍桿子下而逃了過來。常革子慚漸悶熟的時候，他們到了一個大都市。繁華的景象，使他們心旌搖曳。那天晚上，他們對行路的女人動手動脚，被路過的兵士抓住。其中一個冷琍的秀才，就拿出若干眞理之菓，讀出了衆人的身子。</p>
<p>再向南走，到了溫暖的地帶。這專的兵士們正在受復員的訓練，確科是一派昇平氣象，秀才們懷了幾顆將爛的菓子，被歡迎去傳授眞理。</p>
<p>不料正在這時，又一隊秀才也到了。爲了爭奪　席，兩隊秀才互相詬駡，指斥對方是野狐　，確定自己是眞道學，並且拿僅存的幾個爛菓子，當作武器投　對方。於是正在訓練的兵士們，也被喚起鬥爭的熟情，參加作戰。剛剛放下的屠刀，重新又抬了起來。而難得的太平，一剎那又消滅了。</p>
<p>秀才們見了戰爭害怕，各自分途逃回。到了曲阜，不免做個報告，也算交代。報告中說他們曾經遇到多少兵士，以及後來兩隊人互相發生糾紛，並沒有把眞理向兵士宣揚，當時一位史學家（當然也是個秀才）覺得文字太　嘴了，便運用春秋筆法寫道：</p>
<p>「秀才遇着兵，有理講不淸。」</p>
<h3>談亞嵩和珅</h3>
<p>— 愛菊</p>
<p>貪與侈，　　　之烈，甚於洪水猛獸，不但害及官方，害及社會，害及國家，亦因之滅亡，如前所言榮慶等，然其本身，亦可無久享之理，終必身敗名裂而後已。如明末之嚴嵩，前淸之和珅皆是也。嵩敗後，年已八十，市樓旣伏法，嵩且淪爲乞丐，流離而死。然至今讀冰山錄，嵩之所藉沒財產，書畫碑帖珍品外，即金製一項，五光十色，已閱之眩目，固非近今敵偽時代充公之各漢奸財產，所能比例。又豈囤積黃金若干條，收買大廈苦干所之巨　，所能夢見哉？若和坤，其初不過一　　抬轎者耳，不知以何調言，忽然稱旨。乾隆末年，居然位冠百僚，各省凡有負獻，和珅亦必刦收一分。有時且有勝於進奉之品。相傳嘉慶於乾隆末年。在某殿偶誤碎一陣設之翡翠盤，乃高宗所篤愛者，徧索京中各大骨董肆，竟不可得。有人戲策，謂和珅有之，再四向和懇商。僅乃得之，且高於原有陳設之件，向來和珅對於諸阿哥，言　不遜，嘉慶本積忿己久，此次又備受和之揶揄，而嘉慶乃怒不可遏矣。純廟旣崩，嘉慶即藉沒之，且置珅於法，罪狀昭著，載在東　錄中，常時有和珅跌倒，嘉慶吃飽之謠，其所貪婪之贓，當不亞於冰山錄也。鳴呼！嵩與珅之前車可鑒，胡今之刦收大員，因奢侈之享用，極貪污之能事，以自取滅亡，尚來軫方遵乎</p>
<h3>放寬胸襟</h3>
<p>— 楊治民</p>
<p>「生活是一個無情的敵人，生活指數是防範敵人倫襲的一支生力軍。」過去我們這樣說，但是現在呢？誰都知道這支生力軍是完全覆沒了。那末，今後我們祇有恭迎着無情的敵人乾脆地襲進來　。</p>
<p>「今天無米，明天無柴」這種刺激着精神上的痛苦，遲早一點要臨到我們身上來的。於是知己朋友一見了面，大家便以「放寬胸襟」這一句成語來作　藉之詞。</p>
<p>使我們眞正　　達到「放寬胸襟」的境地，政府務須要給我們安定的生活，要有安定的生活，第一便是物價的不能再行濫漲，配給的物品，要有一定的作價，一定的日期，可能的寬裕時問，再不要擠擠軋軋的敎人精神上受到不愉快的感覺，這一點我想該是可能範圍巾人民所應得的一種權利。這雖說不到是一件「放寬胸襟」的事情，但是在我們（人民）的心頭上，至少會感　政府的一春德政的。</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>他這一走，那女客就哭得更厲害了。她國然受不了他的虐待，而她的不慣自立的習性，又使她覺得自己非靠小沈不可。小沈一走，扔下她，敎她怎麼辦呢？在她的心裏，這樣兵荒馬亂的時世，沒有男人靠傍是活不下去的。</p>
<p>「唉！你們道一鬧可眞鬧僵了！」盧前禁不住又喟然長嘆起來。</p>
<p>「怕什麼？他要金小姐跟咱們走，咱們就帶她走」！吹口琴的大孩子毫不思案地說。</p>
<p>「眞的！怕什麼？除掉民敎館的十幾位之外，咱們一起也不過二十多個人，加上金小姐有什麼關係」？好幾個不知天高地厚的大孩子都這樣說。</p>
<p>前　是　氣。金小妣只是哭。</p>
<p>「別怕！金小姐，大不了你也跟我們一起演戲」！有一個女孩子竭力想安慰這個可憐的女人。</p>

<p>這也不妨，讓她給我們煮了飯也是有用的」！吹口琴的大孩子倔强地說。</p>
<p>「可是，張昌，就說走連咱們自己也不知道怎麼個走法咧」！盧跛子顯出了憂心如焚的神氣。「唉！你們算是好心，別害了金小姐……」！有人想打斷他的話，他擺一握手，又沉痛地說：「她跟小沈，人家是做生意的，有的是便車，說不定明後天就右以光得成。可是，咱們呢？固然咱們現在也不想走，但到眞要走的時候，你們想就會有車子嗎？唉！請瞧吧！調上前綫去增援的部隊也得赤着腿趕路，那兒還有車輸到我們」？</p>
<p>金小姐哭得更傷心了。</p>
<p>「老盧總是一味的悲觀！」有好幾個人這樣說。「沒有卡車，咱們不能擠上火車去嗎？」</p>
<p>「好，大家瞧吧！」盧前無能爲力地說，末了原想再嘆一口氣，可是沒有來得及，門外已走進了一個他們所久候不至的人來。</p>
<p>二十多條嗓子一齊喊高着：「老祝！老祝！」（八）</p>

<h3>The National Army Advances Smoothly on All Fronts: The Shandong Battle Situation Will See New Developments; Fierce Fighting Around Qingdao Has Lasted Nine Days</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan, 8th Dispatch] The new overall deployment of the National Army in Shandong Province has been meticulously completed. The military forces on all fronts are advancing smoothly, and new developments are expected soon. The defense of Jinan is becoming increasingly consolidated, and there has been no fierce fighting on its outskirts for a week. In the outer areas of Weixian, Changle, Qingdao, Jimo, and Jiaoxian, the Communist army's attacks have lasted for nine days and nights, but the National Army still firmly holds each stronghold and is fighting against them. The battle situation in Tianma, near Changle, is becoming increasingly fierce. In recent days, there have been more than ten rounds of charges back and forth each day, but the area remains in the hands of the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xuzhou, 8th Dispatch] More than 20,000 Communist troops in the Culaishan area southeast of Tai'an have been building fortifications near Dawenkou for several days, actively preparing for battle. Military sources say that good news from the front lines in southern Shandong may be reported tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan, 8th Dispatch] The area of operations around Qingdao is expanding. From the evening of the 6th, more than 20,000 Communist troops attacked Balizhuang in the north of Jiaoxian County, Yanggezhuang in the south of the county, and the Dagu River west of the county. After being repelled, they reinforced their troops on the evening of the 7th and attacked Zhongyong Village in the east of the county, attempting to encircle Jiaoxian from all sides. Fierce fighting continued on the evening of the 8th. In addition, several thousand Communist troops harassed Lancun to the east and west of Jiaoxian, the Jiaodong railway stations, and Lianhua Mountain, ten kilometers east of Jimo, on the evenings of the 6th and 7th. All were repelled. When the Communist troops retreated from Lancun and Jiaodong, they destroyed many sections of the railway tracks.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xuzhou, 8th Dispatch] The battle for Jiaoxian is intensifying, and the Communist army is continuing to reinforce the outer areas of Jiaoxian. The Communist Independent Brigade sneaked into Ducunjie, twelve kilometers southwest of Jiaoxian, on the 8th. The Sixth Division sneaked into Shimou, twenty kilometers from Jiaoxian, on the 7th, and the Fifth Division sneaked into Sunjiakou, north of Jiaoxian, and is continuing to move south.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan, 8th Dispatch] The fierce fighting in the Changle area on the outskirts of Weixian has increased. The attacking Communist troops have also increased to more than 20,000. The area of operations has expanded from Tianma and Tan Jiafangzi to Lataipu, Dongxi Fengting, and other places around Changle. Fierce fighting continued until noon on the 7th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] The Communist Police Third and Fifth Brigades sneaked into Paishan Railway Station on the 7th. The Ninth Division sneaked into Wangwang, twenty-eight li northwest of Weixian, and there is a trend of re-offending Zaxian.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xuzhou, 8th Dispatch] The outskirts of Jinan have been calm for several days, but the Communist army is busy with troop movements and may be about to stir again. The Communist Seventh Division sneaked into Mingshui on the 8th, the Twelfth Division sneaked into Zhangqiu, the Fourth Division sneaked into Wenzu Town, the Police Second Brigade sneaked into Xiying, twenty-five kilometers south of Jinan, and the Police First Brigade sneaked into Zhonggong, twenty kilometers from Jinan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xuzhou, 8th Dispatch] The Communist troops in Sishui have increased to more than 30,000 on the 8th. The battle for Sishui is imminent. The National Army in Qufu and Zou County began a probing attack on Sishui on the 8th. There were small contacts in the Nanxinjie and Xiyandian areas. In the area north of Zaozhuang, the National Army continued to consolidate its new positions on the 8th.</p>
<h3>The Battle on the Pinghan Railway Line is Deadlocked: Liu Bocheng's Remnant Communists Invade Kaocheng</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Baoding, 8th Dispatch] The battle on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway line is deadlocked. The Communist troops in the Taihang area west of the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section are busy with troop movements. More than 10,000 troops under Nie Rongzhen are concentrated between Wangdu and Xinle in the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section, attempting to prevent the National Army from connecting this section from north to south, and there is a tendency to secure the corridor area between Fuping section. The 34th Army Group Command in Baoding moved to Xushui today.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 8th Dispatch] The northern section of the Pinghan Railway line has entered a deadlock. The claim of recovering Tangxian is inaccurate. The National Army once detoured into the territory of Tangxian, while the Communist troops detoured north. More than 6,000 people sneaked into the north of Wan County yesterday, and more than 3,000 people sneaked into Dagudian south of Mancheng. The outskirts of Xushui are still tense, and more than 5,000 Communist troops continue to sneak into Xudong. More than 3,000 people sneaked into Santai Town northeast of Baoding yesterday.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 8th Dispatch] After the National Army moved into Mancheng, the Communist troops entrenched nearby were all wiped out. Their remaining main forces fled to the mountains west of Mancheng. In addition to tracking and pursuing them, the National Army is setting up checkpoints and advancing layer by layer. There are no large Communist troops within ten li around Mancheng. Residents have been helping the old and young to return one after another. The county government is now launching relief work.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] Since the National Army reinforcement troops moved into Xushui, the security situation has become increasingly peaceful and the morale of the people is stable. On the night of the 7th, more than 2,000 Communist troops of unknown number suddenly sneaked in from the northwest, carrying six mortars and more than 20 machine guns, and distributed themselves around the west of the city and the Daxiao Jue Liang area, urgently collecting stretchers from nearby villages, seemingly intending to attack the city.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 8th Dispatch] More than 6,000 Communist troops sneaked into Dakangguan north of Wan County and the east side of the Pinghan Railway line. A part of them, more than 3,000, sneaked into the Datongdian area south of Mancheng. In addition, more than 3,000 Communist troops entrenched in Jicai Santai northeast of Baoding are again attempting to attack Mancheng.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 8th Dispatch] Military news: Last month, Communist General Liu Bocheng led seven columns to invade the Longhai Railway. After capturing Caoxian on January 25, they invaded Kaocheng. Although the local security teams have been steadfastly defending, due to the disparity in numbers, towns such as Mengtai Old City in the county have fallen, and the Communist troops have been burning, killing, and looting, which is extremely tragic.</p>
<h3>The Remnant Communist Troops in Guanyun Are Retreating to Yantai</h3>
<p>Representatives from Sixian Petition for Troops to Suppress Them</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xinpu, 5th Dispatch] The remnant Communist troops and more than 10,000 militia from the four counties of Guanyun, Lianshui, Funing, and Binhai, concentrated in Chenjiagang and Xiangshui, and are using more than 100 sailboats to retreat to Yantai, Shandong.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Bengbu, 8th Dispatch] More than 3,000 Communist troops in Sixian have captured Cuicheng and Shijie, causing shock throughout the county. Representatives have been sent to Bengbu and Xuzhou to request the dispatch of troops to suppress them.</p>
<h3>A Train of Empty Cars Derails on the Southern Section of the Chinese Changchun Railway</h3>
<p>The Railway Bridge over the Majiadian River is Damaged</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 8th Dispatch] The Majiadian River railway bridge on the southern section of the Chinese Changchun Railway (Shenyang to Dalian line), which was bombed and destroyed by the Communist troops on the night of the 6th, suffered heavy losses. That night, a train of empty cars heading north from Wafangdian derailed at the point where the tracks were dismantled at the head of the bridge, overturning the cars. The Dashiqiao rescue train rushed to the scene of the accident immediately upon hearing the news to handle the aftermath. The 2,000 Communist troops who attacked the bridge and the Wanjialing railway station have been defeated by the National Army reinforcements. Four staff members of the Wanjialing railway station were captured.</p>
<h3>The Mileage of the Jichang Railway Line</h3>
<p>Has Exceeded Three-Quarters of the Total Length</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 8th Dispatch] Passenger trains from Yongji West on the Jichang Railway line ran to Tumenling on the 8th. Currently, on the 124-kilometer Jichang Railway, only the section between Tumenling and Yuma River is being actively repaired. The military mileage of the east-west communication between Jilin and Changchun has exceeded three-quarters of the total mileage.</p>
<h3>Chief Chen Flies to Ji'nan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xuzhou, 8th Dispatch] Chief Chen Cheng flew from Xuzhou to Ji'nan on the morning of the 7th.</p>
<h3>County Magistrates in Central Shandong Are Rewarded and Punished Respectively</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 8th Dispatch] Tan Ziqi, Special Commissioner of the 10th District of Shandong, and Zhai Yuwei, Special Commissioner of the 12th District, were authorized to order the county magistrates under their jurisdiction to withdraw when the Communist troops invaded central Shandong. The 16th Resolution Committee of the Shandong Provincial Government has decided to remove them from their posts but retain them. Liang Ruwei, County Magistrate of Boshan, Cheng Xuetong, County Magistrate of Zichuan, Li Guideng, County Magistrate of Zouping, Zhou Tong, County Magistrate of Zhangqiu, and Liu Shengwu, County Magistrate of Changshan, were also given two major demerits each for misunderstanding the order and withdrawing from their jurisdictions. Liu Zhenzhang, County Magistrate of Laiwu, and Xu Zhenxi, County Magistrate of Xintai, cooperated with the military and went deep into the occupied areas. All measures were in accordance with the requirements of pacification. Although they eventually withdrew from the county due to changing circumstances, they risked their lives and made outstanding achievements, and were each given one major merit and awarded a bonus of 500,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>The First Batch of American Troops Leaving China Will Depart for Guam This Week</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Beiping, 8th Dispatch] It is reported that after former US Special Envoy to China, Marshall, announced his resignation from mediating the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the first batch of withdrawing US troops will be dispatched to Guam within a week. The first batch of withdrawing US troops are the troops stationed in Tianjin, who have been fully equipped and are ready to depart for Guam on transport ships from Tanggu in the coming days, deploying everything in preparation for the rest of the troops to continue to be stationed there. The official departure date is subject to the announcement from Washington, so the US military here has not been able to confirm this news. The total withdrawal of the US military may be delayed until sometime next month or early May. How long they remain depends on the withdrawal of the last batch of American personnel from the previous convoy. This last batch of withdrawing personnel is scheduled to return home on the 7th of next month, but there will still be a few hundred people staying until May to complete everything. When the main force of the US military withdraws, 50 US troops in Beiping will be among the first to depart.</p>

<h3>The National Army in Northeast China Has Loyally Achieved Military Success: The Chairman Specially Awards Medals; Du Yuming Broadcasted the Course of the Battle Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 8th Dispatch] This time, the National Army completely defeated the superior forces of the Communist troops who were disturbing Changchun, Dehui, Nong'an, and other places in the snowy and icy Northeast, achieving unprecedented results. The Chairman deeply appreciates the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers in stabilizing the local areas and protecting the people. In addition to sending a special telegram of commendation, he also awarded medals to the meritorious generals and soldiers. These medals have now been forwarded to the Commander-in-Chief's Office by the Northeast Headquarters, and Chief Du will personally award the medals in Changchun in the coming days. There are three types of medals: the Army, Navy, and Air Force Medal, the Thousand-City Medal, and the Guanghua Medal, totaling more than one hundred.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 8th Dispatch] There are no traces of Communist troops on the south bank of the Songhua River. The National Army has completed its counterattack mission and is currently clearing the area to stabilize the people's livelihood. During this Communist southern invasion, Huang Kecheng, commander of the Communist Liaoning Field Army District and commander of the Third Division, was killed by the National Army in Longfeng Mountain during the battle of Dedong. Many other regimental and battalion commanders also died in the National Army's artillery fire.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] In the Battle of Dehui, the National Army achieved brilliant results. Huang Kecheng, commander of the Communist Independent Third Division, died on the battlefield during the fierce fighting on Phoenix Mountain northwest of Dehui. Wan Yi, deputy commander of the First Column of the Communist Jilin-Liaoning Field Army District, died of serious injuries in Shanghewan. It is also reported that the commanders of the 53rd Regiment of the 18th Division and the 24th Regiment of the 7th Brigade were killed in the Battle of Dehui. In summary, the Independent First Division suffered the most casualties among the Communist forces in the Changchun-Jilin area.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 8th Dispatch] The Beiping Headquarters received a telegram from the Northeast military today stating that the Communist army suffered heavy casualties in the Battle of Dehui. Its Commander Huang Kecheng, Commander of the Third Army, Chen Xuedao, Commander of the 53rd Regiment of the 18th Division, and Song Zhaolai, Commander of the 20th Regiment of the Third Division, were all killed in battle. A total of the defeated Communist army's First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Sixteenth, Seventeenth, Eighteenth, Twenty-first, Twenty-fourth, and Thirty-first Divisions, and the Thirty-fifth and Ninth Brigades, Tian Song's troops, the Jibei Military Region, three artillery regiments of the First and Third Military Subdistricts, and the First Tank Battalion, etc., suffered more than 30,000 casualties, captured more than 1,400 people, seized four tanks, 1,109 rifles, more than 30 light machine guns, and 16 heavy machine guns. The rest is still being checked. The Communist army currently deployed in Wujia Station has the Fourth and Sixth Divisions, one regiment in Wu Ke Shu, two brigades in Taolai Zhao, and one division in Sanyouhe.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 8th Dispatch] Chief Du Yuming broadcasted the course of the Changchun outer perimeter battle at the Changchun Central News Agency Radio Station at 8:15 p.m. on the 8th. He said that this battle was a strategy of luring the enemy in deep. Due to secrecy, it could not be announced in advance, causing the people in the counties along the river to suffer unprecedented devastation, and the elders of Changchun and Yongji also suffered greatly from the false alarms. The people are very uneasy, the Communist army launched its military offensive, its means were cruel, its actions were despicable, and the people of the Northeast will surely remember it. The Communist army first attempted to invade Changchun twice, but both failed. Now they have launched a full-scale invasion across the river, and Mao Zedong personally presided over it in the Northeast, and Lin Biao also convened a military conference in Harbin, which shows how important this action is. The Communist army claimed to have mobilized 300,000 troops this time, but they have already mobilized 200,000 people. The scale of the invasion on all fronts is unprecedented. They planned to capture Changchun and then invade Liaopan. At the same time, they also launched an offensive in southern and western Liaoning to support them. The Communist army's conspiracy was foreseen by the National Army, and countermeasures were formulated. Therefore, after the Communist army crossed the river, the National Army gradually implemented the predetermined plan, concentrated its forces, and shortened the front line. The garrison of Dehui had only four battalions, and the garrison of the bridgehead had only two platoons, but they were able to follow orders, defend independently, and fight the main force of the Communist army for ten days without being moved. The Communist army's offensive was frustrated and suffered heavy sacrifices. At the same time, the National Army stationed in Jilin and Changchun launched attacks on all sides, defeating them in one fell swoop. The Communist army fled in panic, losing more than 30,000 elite troops. Their arrogant attempt has finally become an illusion. In summary, this battle was extremely fierce, but we were able to defeat the Communist army, militarily breaking their attempt to attack fortified positions and politically defeating their ambition to forcibly seize territory. At the same time, we smashed their international propaganda conspiracy. This glorious victory depends on the brave sacrifice of all officers and soldiers, and the 600,000 people of Changchun mobilized to maintain security and assist the National Army. The military and civilians of Dehui are united and unwavering, and their spirit of doing what is right and being brave is a traditional expression of the Chinese nation's moral character for 5,000 years and a symbol of the spirit of military-civilian cooperation.</p>
<h3>The Communist Army in Southern Liaoning Is Actively Operating</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 8th Dispatch] The Communist army's activities in southern Liaoning have recently become more active. According to military sources: (1) More than 4,000 Communist troops launched a full-scale attack on Majiatun, 15 kilometers north of Miaoxizhen, on the morning of the 3rd. The Communist army there defended with all its strength, launching repeated attacks and killings. After a bloody battle for a day and night, the Communist army suffered heavy casualties. When the National Army reinforcements arrived at noon on the 4th, they were immediately defeated. The remaining Communist troops left more than 600 bodies and fled to the southeast. (2) On the night of the 4th, about 3,000 Communist troops attacked the garrison of Shijiatun, one kilometer east of Pulandian. Another part attempted to cut off the National Army's reinforcements by detouring around the area north of Shijiatun. After the garrison fought bravely, they repelled the detouring troops by dawn on the 6th. However, the Communist troops on the front were still fighting.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The more than 20,000 Communist troops who occupied Tongliao were besieged by our garrison after breaking through. After reorganizing near Dalin, they joined forces with the reinforcements and intercepted the Communist troops in the area. The fighting was fierce, and the Communist army suffered more than 1,000 casualties and fled in all directions. Our army took advantage of the victory and advanced to the outskirts of the city.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The Communist army north of Dalian attacked Shijiatun (east of Pulandian) again on the 5th. The National Army has given it a strong blockade.</p>
<h3>The CCP Barters Goods with the Soviet Union: A Large Amount of Grain is Transported to Soviet Territory</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 7th Dispatch] According to a telegram from Changchun by New York Times reporter Wells on March 6, the Communist Party of Northeast China is transporting 6,000 tons of grain daily to Soviet Siberia via railway in exchange for Soviet coal, kerosene, perfume, matches, cigarettes, and other items. Wells quoted Chinese railway engineers and other personnel who had just arrived in Changchun from the Communist area as saying that the Harbin Communist Party and the Soviet Union had established a barter agreement to transport grain to Siberia, and the transaction began two months ago. So far, 900,000 tons of wheat, soybeans, beef, pork, sorghum, and corn have been transported to the Soviet Union. Furs are also included. According to Wells, an average of ten freight cars leave Harbin every day, each carrying 600 tons of goods. Five of them go to Manzhouli, and the other five go to Suifenhe. He said that since the freight began at the end of January, the Soviet Union has transported 65 Japanese-made locomotives to Harbin. These locomotives were taken away by the Soviet army when they occupied the Northeast. In addition, a large number of railway technicians were sent to Harbin. Wells also said that according to people who had just arrived here from Harbin, since the freight began, grain prices in Harbin have risen by more than 200%. After the Communist Party's two offensives against the National Army along the Songhua River failed, the value of the anti-currency fell sharply, and they began to hoard grain, which resulted in further inflation. It is said that the poorest residents have also turned against the Communist Party. This resentment is due to the lack of coal during the cold season, the stagnation of commerce, the heavy taxes, the recruitment of all people from the age of eighteen to forty-five, and the stationing of Communist troops in each household. Anyone who dares to criticize the Communist regime is labeled as an "absolute reactionary" and killed. Many people have fled to the National Army areas. The Communist Party issues exit permits in Harbin to allow people to go to Changchun to buy goods that are exclusively lacking in Harbin, but the procedure for obtaining these permits is extremely complicated and time-consuming, because the Communist Party is afraid that they will not return.</p>
<p>There is No Religious Freedom Under the Rule of the Chinese Communists</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 8th Dispatch] Father Connors, a priest of the American St. Columbas Church and a correspondent for the National Catholic News Agency, recently came here from Yan'an. Today, he published a statement in an English newspaper denying that there is religious freedom in Yan'an. This is the most severe article by American observers criticizing the CCP's religious policy. It strongly argues that "the CCP persecutes religion in various parts of North China. Although there are formal and degree differences in various places, the principles are consistent."</p>
<p>This statement directly refutes the recent Associated Press report on religious freedom in Yan'an. The article is accompanied by a photo of a church in Yan'an, titled: "Desecrated Holy Land." The article states: "The churches in Yan'an are now used by the CCP to store grain. The pulpits are filled with millet and grains. All the windows of the churches have been damaged. The walls are covered with CCP slogans."</p>
<p>"On February 15, I held Mass for Catholics in Yan'an. The Mass was not held in the church, but in a former Catholic elementary school. I guessed that the CCP wanted to use our gathering for propaganda. Sure enough, the Shanghai newspapers published C.T. Sim's Associated Press report on the religious gathering in Yan'an on February 15. Who is this Associated Press reporter who personally participated in my religious gathering? At that time, the only Chinese who could speak English was Ma Shengming (transliteration), who was a member of the CCP and belonged to the 18th Group. He accompanied me throughout my visit to the church. He is a senior official of the foreign reporters' liaison office. I dare not conclude that this new article was written by Ma. But he must be the ghostwriter of this article. He did not explain why I could not hold Mass in the church. I can point out that the reason is that all the buildings of the church, except for the two rooms of the elementary school, have been occupied by the CCP army."</p>
<p>"When Mr. Ma accompanied me to see Father Liang, I spoke to Father Liang in Latin, but he shook his head and did not answer. His expression was rather uneasy. Father Liang is a graduate of Fu Jen Catholic University and is enthusiastic about Latin. Why did he remain silent? This made me very surprised. Later, I learned that it is not appropriate to talk in a language that they do not understand in front of the CCP officials."</p>
<p>"The CCP leaders all unanimously advocate the CCP's religious freedom, but in practice, they are obeying in public but disobeying in private. The American officials of the Military Mediation Department are all familiar with this situation. However, because they are working hard to mediate, they do not want to speak freely. Now is the time to publicize it."</p>
<p>American Missionary Woman Arrested by the CCP</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 8th Dispatch] The Presbyterian Church Foreign Missions Board announced today that Mrs. Jenness, a missionary of the church stationed in China, was arrested by the CCP in a village in Shunde County, Southern Hebei, three months ago. Mrs. Jenness came to China to preach in 1916, and her husband passed away in Shunping in 1941.</p>
<h3>To Seek Prosperity in the Countryside, Industrial Development is Necessary: Weng Zhiyong Talks About the Planned Economy Proposal</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] Weng Zhiyong, Acting Director of the Economic Research Office of the Central Agricultural Bank, talked about the "Planned Economy" proposal put forward by Xiao Zheng, which was approved by the National Defense Council a few days ago. Its main purpose is based on first prospering the rural economy, and then developing the industrial economy. This view is the same as that of the general public, because farmers account for 85% of China's total population. However, Weng Zhiyong believes that the main purpose of prospering the countryside is to develop security, such as Britain's development of India, which was based on an Indian shipping company, which improved its transportation and made India what it is today. Therefore, the focus should be on restoring transportation. At the same time, the proposal includes the mechanization of agriculture, and then advocating "those who till the land own the land." In fact, agriculture currently relies heavily on industry. In terms of collective farms, agricultural machinery and tools are needed. Therefore, in our country after everything is peaceful, its economic construction should wait for the development of industry before we can talk about agriculture, because the development from agriculture to industry is too slow. The current rural economy in our country is really about the stability of the villages.</p>

<h3>Survey of Qaidam Basin; Survey Team of Over 400 People Formed; To Depart Next Month, Penetrating Deep into the Interior</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 8th] The Qaidam Basin, located in the northwest of Qinghai Province, is separated from the Tarim Basin in southern Xinjiang by only one mountain. It is larger in area than the entire Zhejiang Province. In ancient times, it was a thoroughfare for east-west travel, and traces of beacon towers still exist today. In the past, Mongols roamed there as nomads. More than a decade ago, due to the invasion of Kazakhs, the Mongols migrated to other places, resulting in the desolation of the basin and the absence of human habitation. In the 31st year of the Republic [1942], an office for the supervision of agricultural reclamation was established, but it only started reclamation in a few data points along the Suiyuan border, and did not achieve practical results. Last year, the Qinghai-Xinjiang Highway Survey Team penetrated deep into the basin, which was the first time that scientists from the interior had traversed the entire territory. However, the land is mostly alkaline. According to existing data, the value of developing the basin does not seem to be too high, far inferior to the reclamation area in the Northeast. The basin was abandoned for this reason. The recent formation of a survey team intends to use modern scientific methods to overcome natural difficulties in order to meet national defense needs. However, to penetrate deep into the desolate Han [area], the allocation of all manpower and materials must be carefully deployed. It is estimated that the entire team will have more than 400 people, costing more than 1 billion yuan. The team is scheduled to depart in April when the construction of the Yuxin Highway begins, heading west from Xining along the southern edge of the Bayan Har Mountains, turning back at the Altyn-Tagh Mountains at the junction of Qinghai and Xinjiang, and then heading along the northern edge of the Qilian Mountains to Delingha, passing through Dulan Salt Lake and returning to Qinghai. When necessary, it plans to directly enter the interior for a detailed survey. Qinghai Chairman Ma Bufang attaches great importance to this work and has decided to fully support the team in achieving the first exploration of the basin in its history.</p>

<h3>Cocktail Party Held by British and French Consuls-General in Shanghai to Celebrate the Treaty of Alliance Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] To celebrate the recently concluded Anglo-French Treaty of Alliance, the British and French Consulates-General in this city held a cocktail party at the British Country Club yesterday at noon to entertain various circles. More than 200 guests attended, including Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen, Commander of the British Pacific Fleet Power, and most of the rest were British and French nationals. British Consul-General Ogden delivered a speech, emphasizing the historical friendship between Britain and France, and said: After the last major war, it was mistakenly believed that Germany had lost its military strength and would no longer be a threat, allowing the Anglo-French alliance to disintegrate, and enabling Germany to rise again. Historical lessons are deeply alarming. The signing of the Anglo-French alliance took place in Dunkirk, and the timing was just before the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, which is very meaningful. France has now allied with the Soviet Union, and the Anglo-French alliance can prevent Germany's re-emergence at any time, and is a cornerstone of world peace. After the speech, the band played the Marseillaise and toasted "Long live France!" French Consul-General Pei Yiyang followed with a speech, and after the speech, the British national anthem was played to show respect. The meeting ended at about 1:00 p.m.</p>

<p>Weekly Forum</p>
<h3>On Foreign Relations from a Moral Perspective</h3>
<p>— Jiang Junzhang</p>
<p>Our Chinese nation has a universal traditional morality, that is, the concept of respecting merit and repaying kindness. During the Warring States period, Lord Wuji of Wei stole military tallies, seized Jin Bi's army, defeated the Qin army, and relieved the siege of Zhao. The King of Zhao and Lord Pingyuan greeted him with sincerity and respect, but Wuji looked proud. One of his officers, a butcher by the name of Zhu Hai, admonished him with the meaning of "One should never forget the kindness others have shown him; one should never remember the kindness one has shown others." Wuji gladly accepted, and this story has been passed down as a beautiful tale. Mr. Guo Moruo even wrote a play called "The Tiger Tally" to arrange and promote the history of Lord Xinling rescuing Zhao. In the wartime capital of Chongqing, it attracted many audiences. This concept of repaying kindness received and not expecting repayment for kindness given is an undeniable noble morality. The "repayment" here is nothing more than four forms, namely repaying kindness with kindness, repaying grievances with grievances, repaying kindness with grievances, and repaying grievances with kindness. No Chinese person does not deeply hate the event of "repaying kindness with grievances" and will never advocate it. This can be said to be one of our national morals.</p>
<p>Looking at the relationship between China and the United States, the United States has traditionally dealt with events related to China with a policy of sovereign independence, territorial integrity, open doors, and equal opportunities. Of course, this has its own position, but these things do not create a "grievance" in the minds of the Chinese people. As for the United States' support for our war of resistance with manpower, financial resources, and material resources during this war, and finally sacrificing the blood of its people on the Chinese battlefield, this is certainly for common interests, but it will not lead to resentment among the people of China. As for the post-war period, the United States helped us accept surrender, helped us return prisoners, gave us credit loans, mediated our internal disputes, assisted in the training of our army, and even hoped to provide greater economic assistance under possible circumstances to make us a democratic and prosperous country. The United States' policy toward China is certainly for the peace of the Pacific Ocean, that is, for its own security, but these measures do not pose any danger to China, so why should we form an intractable resentment? Therefore, our overall view of the central point of the anti-American movement is the presence of U.S. troops in China, and the central demand is the withdrawal of U.S. troops. In fact, this issue is very clear in the hearts of the average Chinese person: when the time comes, the U.S. troops will definitely return, and even if we want to keep them, we cannot. And when they go back, they will definitely go back cleanly and will never take a blade of grass or a tree from us. Therefore, the anti-American movement in China has no purpose to speak of.</p>
<p>Although the anti-American movement in China has its obvious international character, the actual center is probably the interests of the party. There are several simple facts that we can review: (1) When the United States wanted to reorganize the Chinese army and equip it with American equipment in order to counterattack Japan, the Chinese Communists proposed the requirement of proportional equipment for the Communist troops. They were using the effort of the war of resistance to cater to the American mentality of defeating Japan as soon as possible, in order to impress some American generals. The result was failure. The dismissal of U.S. General Stilwell and U.S. Ambassador to China Gauss was related to this matter. Before this incident, the Chinese Communists were not anti-American. After this incident, the Chinese Communists and the left-wingers of the Allied countries often mentioned Mr. Stilwell's dismissal, expressing great regret; and the responsible persons of the U.S. government have since been called reactionaries by the Chinese Communists. (2) A period of time after Japan's surrender was the golden period for the development of the Chinese Communists. They expanded from a base of seventy-odd counties to more than three hundred counties within a month or two; during this time, the U.S. Navy was working hard to help the Chinese government army handle the work of accepting surrender and returning prisoners, and the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union was changing rapidly on the international political stage. Since Japan's surrender, the Chinese Communists' anti-American movement has been developing day by day. From these facts, we can see whether the Chinese Communists' anti-American movement is for the socialist motherland? Or for the Chinese Communist Party itself? We can easily get the correct answer. And has the development of this movement been for the sake of the country and the nation? We can know without thinking.</p>
<p>Due to the development of the second fact mentioned above, the first slogan of the Chinese Communists against the United States after the victory was to oppose the presence of U.S. troops in China, and their demand was for the U.S. troops to withdraw from China. However, the U.S. troops in China did not come suddenly; they came for the victory of the United Nations and to cooperate in defeating Japan on the Chinese battlefield. They did not come to take advantage of the victory, rob resources, or move materials. The war had just ended, the bloodshed was not yet dry, the task had not been completed, and the efforts were in full swing. How could we start the movement to withdraw the U.S. troops? However, the Chinese Communists have their own propaganda methods. On the eve of Japan's surrender, Zhu De, the commander-in-chief of the Chinese Communist Army, issued seven orders in a row, ordering his troops to attack the government troops or the enemy and puppet troops awaiting surrender, seize cities and territories, and even spread the news of victory. The Chinese Communists called the war at this time "liberation" and "uprising." After October, the war did not make much progress, or even suffered defeats. He called the war at that time a civil war, and civil war should be opposed. He advocated the anti-civil war movement. U.S. troops helping the government army accept surrender and return prisoners were obviously beneficial to the government army, and vice versa, it was detrimental to the Chinese Communist army. Therefore, the Chinese Communists put the blame for fueling the civil war on the heads of the U.S. troops in China and opposed them. Therefore, the official launch of the Chinese Communists' anti-American movement was carried out under the cover of anti-civil war. When the Sino-American Commercial Treaty was established, the Chinese Communists launched another anti-American movement, using inequality as a pretext and calling for the prosperity of national capital and industry and commerce. However, there was no way to link it to the issue of U.S. troops in China, so they had to drop the subject. However, the Beiping Dong'an incident, in which a U.S. soldier raped a female student, Shen Chong, was a simple incident of a soldier breaking the law, but it was related to the presence of U.S. troops in China, and this incident happened to run counter to the Chinese society's concept of chastity. They used this psychology to expand the problem, but ultimately it was to withdraw the U.S. troops. By analogy, the Quan Gong Building incident was a kind of anti-American movement, mainly to boycott American goods, but this movement could only be carried out under the cover of loving domestic goods. The reason is the same. In short, the Chinese Communists take seizing power as their goal, the government as their enemy, and the friends of the government as their quasi-enemies, and therefore do their best to oppose them. Assuming that the Soviet Union sincerely helped the government to realize China's unification as the United States did, or that the attitudes of the United States and the Soviet Union toward China were reversed, then which country would the Chinese Communists carry out an anti-movement against? This is also a question that can be easily answered.</p>
<p>The Chinese Communists' anti-American movement in the government area is in a guiding position, and is implemented by scholars or businessmen who are dissatisfied with the government's measures. If we compare the leaders of several major anti-American movements and their party relations with the newspapers that have worked hard to promote them, we can find that in the past anti-American movements, there were speeches, articles, and statements, and the names were only a few, as if these gentlemen were specializing in this kind of business. They specialize in this kind of business. What exactly is it for? They also said that it was for peace, for democracy, and for the interests of the country and the nation, but what is the real purpose? Only they themselves know. There is a class of helpers in Chinese society, which can be called "gentry." They specialize in "resolving difficulties," so they also hope that there will be more "difficulties" and "disputes" in society. Otherwise, they will have nothing to resolve and will gain nothing. If we compare this situation with the current political situation, it is also very interesting to think about.</p>
<p>In short, looking at the anti-American movement in China from the past and future relations between China and the United States, from the relationship between the interests of the country and the nation, and from the perspective of China's national morality, this movement is impossible to happen. Looking at the United States' policy toward China, this movement is even less necessary to happen. However, under the premise that the interests of the party outweigh everything else, this movement has actually happened, which is a major stain on our nation's inherent morality.</p>
<p>We can see from the development methods of the anti-American movement that it is playing with the masses and deceiving the people. We need democracy, peace, unification, and national construction internally, and we need harmony between the United States and the Soviet Union to jointly maintain the peace of the Pacific Ocean externally. China cannot be anti-American, just as it cannot be anti-Soviet. This is a simple creed that our intellectuals should have.</p>

We have a constitution that absolutely guarantees equality between men and women. In the future, we should strive to shoulder the responsibilities of citizens. Dr. Wu Yifang gave a speech, with the following three main points: (1) Improve the quality of female workers; (2) Have lofty goals and outstanding style, and pay special attention to choosing a career that is close to your own personality; (3) Compared with women in various countries, although the women's movement in China is a latecomer, its achievements have been praised all over the world.

(2) If the evidence is solid, but the case is relatively minor and does not require the confiscation of property, or there is no property, or it is not known whether there is property, the traitor case should be submitted to the Ministry of Justice for a transfer order of arrest. (3) If it is based on accusations, and although it is known that a traitorous crime has been committed, the evidence cannot be confirmed. It is necessary to track down the case for investigation, the Higher Procuratorate shall conduct a patrol arrest in accordance with the law, but it must be reported for record.

<h3>On the Eve of the Opening of the Council of Foreign Ministers, Bevin Arrives in Moscow, Marshall to Fly from Berlin to the Soviet Union Today</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] San Francisco, 8th broadcast: The Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference is scheduled to open on the 10th. The British delegation, led by Bevin, arrived at the Belarusian Railway Station today. This is the first delegation of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference to arrive in the Soviet Union. Marshall and Bidault will arrive in Moscow on Sunday. Marshall is in Berlin today, holding all-day talks with General McNarney, the US military commander, to study the 700-page report of the Allied Control Council. Marshall declared in Berlin that during the upcoming Foreign Ministers' Conference, he will urge the other three countries to sign a 40-year pact with the United States to govern Germany's military rehabilitation and prevent the resurgence of Germany's war industry.</p>
<p>[Reuters Moscow, 8th dispatch] Foreign Secretary Bevin, upon arriving in Moscow by special train this afternoon, stated in a speech that he was delighted to return to Moscow on behalf of the British people to extend greetings to the Soviet Union. He expressed his hope that world peace could prevent future aggression and ensure security for the entire world. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky personally went to the airport to welcome Bevin.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's report] London, 8th broadcast: When British Foreign Secretary Bevin flew to Moscow to attend the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, Molotov did not go to the airport to welcome him, nor was the Soviet national anthem played by a band, as is usually the case when welcoming dignitaries from various countries to the Soviet capital. This has aroused various discussions, as even when the Polish Prime Minister arrived in Moscow last week, there were various welcoming ceremonies.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Vienna, 8th dispatch] General Clark, commander of the US forces in Austria, left for Moscow via Berlin today.</p>
<p>[United Press Moscow, 8th dispatch] The US delegation attending the Moscow Conference, in addition to Secretary of State Marshall and his advisors, arrived here on the 8th in eight airplanes.

<p>The famous Soviet diplomatic expert, Munin, gave a speech on the issue of this conference on the evening of the 7th. After the speech, when answering questions from the audience, he pointed out: "The British train of twelve carriages (meaning twelve proposals) is on its way to the Soviet Union, but three of them are tightly covered." Munin also said that the German issue would be the most difficult in this conference, but with sincere cooperation, there are various reasons to believe that the German issue can be resolved. If a peace treaty with Germany can be concluded based on the Potsdam Agreement, then we need not fear the conspiracy of American capitalists to turn Germany into a colony.</p>
<h3>Secretary Marshall Reveals: Intention to Propose a Four-Power Pact</h3>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 8th dispatch] Today, Marshall revealed here that the United States will propose a four-nation, 40-year agreement at the Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference to regulate Germany's demilitarization and industrial revival. In April of last year, former US Secretary of State Byrnes also made a similar suggestion of a 25-year agreement to the British, Soviet, and French governments. He also assured France and other neighboring countries of Germany that the United States did not want to withdraw from Germany until peace was definitively guaranteed. Later, in his speech in Stuttgart, Byrnes changed the term to 40 years, but the British, Soviet, and French governments have not yet expressed any opinion on it. Recently, Paris seems to hope that in addition to the British-Soviet-French triangular alliance agreement, the four-nation agreement will also be signed at the same time to ensure the possibility of jointly preventing Germany from aggressing again.</p>
<p>[Reuters Berlin, 8th dispatch] Before leaving here for the Soviet capital, Secretary of State Marshall stated that the United States believes that completing the four-power control of Germany pact previously proposed by Byrnes is extremely important. This is to show the world that the United States continues to care about Europe and accepts the responsibilities of other parts of the world. We believe that if this matter can be agreed upon, many difficulties concerning Germany and Austria can be easily resolved. Secretary Marshall also said that he had met with the French President, Prime Minister, and other officials in Paris, allowing him to understand in advance the French government's various opinions on Europe and the Moscow Conference. In Berlin, he received reports on the situation in Germany from senior officials of the US occupation zone, such as McNarney, Clay, and Murphy. Secretary Marshall is scheduled to fly to Moscow tomorrow morning. He made the aforementioned statement to American citizens and American journalists.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on Various Allied Treaties are Busy, Czech-Polish Treaty Scheduled to be Signed Today, Belgian-Czech Negotiations Underway in Prague</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 8th dispatch] In the week before the opening of the Moscow Conference, the negotiations on the allied treaties were extremely tense. The Anglo-French treaty was signed in Dunkirk on Tuesday, and the Czech-Polish treaty will also be signed in Warsaw on Sunday. These two treaties have many similarities, and some thorny issues have yet to be resolved. Britain and France have not yet reached an agreement on the future control of the Ruhr area and the distribution of Ruhr coal production. Just as the treaty was about to be signed, Britain's appointment of Germans as managers of the Ruhr industry almost prevented the treaty from being signed. The Czech-Polish treaty negotiations have been going on for several months, but no solution has yet been found regarding who owns the Teschen and Glacier regions. It is expected that the treaty will state that these issues will be left to be resolved within two years. In addition, after Belgium and France held preliminary talks, Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak will also travel to Prague, intending to establish an alliance treaty with the Czech Republic.

<h3>The German Question: The Key to European Peace</h3>
<p>The German question is currently the only unresolved issue among the defeated European nations. The foreign ministers of the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France will soon hold a meeting to begin discussions. This article describes the current situation in Germany, which is useful for those concerned about the global situation.</p>
<p>The German question currently facing the four powers is one of the most difficult issues in the quest for peace. In any case, the future of Europe is always linked to the fate of Germany. If the Soviet Union and Western countries are to coexist harmoniously, they must be able to agree on the German question.</p>
<p>When the foreign ministers of the various countries discuss the procedures for discussing the German question, they must consider the changes that Germany has undergone since the Potsdam Conference and the changes in Germany's relations with the major powers. The Potsdam Conference once established various regulations for the four powers' occupation of Germany, but in fact, it formed a plan for German peace.</p>
<p>Today's Germany appears to be different from the Germany at the time of the collapse of the Third Reich. This time, it suffered a far greater blow than the last, which is indeed a more important factor influencing the reconstruction of Europe. The cost and experience of the victorious nations in occupying Germany do not seem to be enough to teach them a lesson, and if they still want to implement the original plan, they will have to pay a considerable price.</p>

<p>The relations between the four powers have also not been without changes. It was difficult for the four powers to achieve coordination immediately after the victory, but few people expected that the struggle for interests and principles would be so profound as to cause a new division in the world, and a German peace treaty has not yet been signed.</p>
<p>In Germany, each occupying country is pursuing its own special goals, disregarding the general principles of the Potsdam decision. For example, France emphasizes the division of a territory, the Soviet Union focuses on reparations, the United Kingdom attaches importance to the restoration and control of the Ruhr industrial area, and the United States strives to eliminate Nazism. In each occupation zone, this method of acting independently makes Germany at a loss.</p>
<p>Today's world is already different from the world when the war just ended. Domestic disputes and unrest have occurred in the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. No one has obtained anything they hoped for from the war, and no government believes that the impact of the war is equivalent to the revolutionary changes that the war should have caused.</p>
<p>Recently, General Clay, Deputy Chairman of the U.S. Military Government in Germany, criticized the lack of courage and realistic views of the German anti-Nazi courts because they often handled unimportant cases first and put aside the trials of important criminals.</p>
<p>But now there is still an opportunity to make the four powers' agreement on Germany not as difficult as the world fears, and the negotiations so far are still encouraging.</p>
<p>The Berlin Supervisory Control Committee is still a place where important representatives of the four powers maintain frequent contact. For a year and a half, they have been dealing with each other on a practical basis. Although this dealing is slow, they have gradually approached a common opinion, that is, the division system has failed, and unified management of Germany is indispensable.</p>
<p>Unification of Occupation Zones Urgently Needs to Be Resolved</p>
<p>Now France and the Soviet Union have not yet recognized the division management system, but in fact, the four countries are already prepared to recognize at some stage of the negotiation that further action is impossible unless Germany has a complete organization and a central government. Therefore, the unification of the zones is the first goal of discussion. If this goal can win the agreement of the three powers other than France, then the first hurdle can be overcome.</p>
<p>The importance of this development is due to the summary of experience. The division system is a fierce means of disarming Germany and completing Germany's military and political defeat; but as a peacetime method, it cannot benefit everyone. For example, the Soviet Union has found that in order to maintain a considerable standard of living, it has to reduce production for reparations, and Western countries have found that in order to purchase food, they have to export a part of the production materials that can be used for reparations. This division system not only divided Germany, but also divided the governments of the Allied countries.</p>
<p>A year and a half of occupying Germany has made it clear to everyone that the German question cannot be solved in isolation. Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, which used to rely on neighboring Germany as their main source of trade income, have now become relief areas. The French insist that they need to get the Saar and the Rhineland, not only for security reasons but also as a precautionary embankment to avoid being mired in the same quagmire as Germany. The Czechs resent that they have lost the Sudetenland because they have lost technology and workers at the same time, as well as the source of Germany's market and material supply. As for Italy, there was a time when 50% of their foreign trade was with Germany.</p>
<p>Due to these circumstances, many factors influence each other, and the 60% reduction in coal mine production in the Ruhr area is the biggest economic panic caused by this war to Europe. The biggest irony after the war is that many vehicles cannot run, and many families cannot keep warm, because there are too few Germans left to manage the coal mines.</p>
<p>In this world, Germany has launched wars twice, and each time it has mobilized many of the world's most powerful countries to subdue it, but this time it has been truly defeated, and it seems difficult for it to launch another war in the near future.</p>
<p>During the war, many post-war designers thought that Europe could be rebuilt without Germany's participation. Many senior officials believed that Germany should only maintain a "soap and kitchen" economy and expel its troops to engage in building places that had been destroyed by the German army. The general principle is this: If we can distribute Germany's industry to other countries and make the industry of other neighboring countries more than that of Germany itself, we will definitely be able to stabilize the economy of the European continent and at the same time make the whole world safer.</p>
<p>Germany is Still the Center of Europe</p>
<p>But the problem is here: lowering the standard of living in Germany also lowers the standard of living in Europe. Under the surveillance of the four powers. It can continue to be in a prisoner's position, but it is still the center of Europe, and we have no way to separate it from the strategic position between the Soviet Union and Western countries. Due to this European geographical situation, the revival of Europe must first revive Germany, and both the East and the West should build peace in Germany, because if we cannot build peace in Germany, then we cannot establish peace anywhere else.</p>
<p>Today, when the foreign ministers of various countries are preparing to begin formal discussions on the issue of German peace, we must not forget that for eighteen months, the chairmen of the four occupation zones in Germany have been constantly striving to find detailed arrangements.</p>
<p>For this reason, Berlin has now become the most interesting capital in Europe, not only because it is where we test occupation methods and occupation policies, but also because it has become a city that has been destroyed by war and is almost the same as the original desert state.</p>
<p>Something will always grow out of the desert, and destruction is the foundation of some kind of new construction. If there are now some forces that can transcend the tendency of division and work hard to pull the various parts together, then there will inevitably be other forces that either engage in destruction or engage in construction.</p>
<p>Sixty million people will inevitably be united, especially in today's overpopulated Germany.</p>
<p>A year ago, we could say that there was no such country as Germany here. At that time, they were still a group of passive people who only wanted to satisfy the food and shelter desires of ordinary animals. Although their health was still good, there is no doubt that the war and defeat not only destroyed cities and factories, but also destroyed the tools and abilities for reconstruction and reconstruction. Today, there are neither reconstruction materials nor reconstruction manpower.</p>
<p>Although the superficial situation in Germany has not changed today, and the entire land is still divided into four parts, no one now, especially the personnel in the four military governments, dares to say that there is no Germany at present.</p>
<p>Agreement Among the Four Powers Is the Most Important</p>
<p>The voting situation in the four occupation zones in Germany, as well as the general trend of people's voting, reflect that the political trend of Germany and other countries with people's voting can be completely free, the same. The German people are the largest, most densely populated, and most harmonious in opinion on the continent of Europe. This makes Germany powerful and dangerous. Germany is now very weak, but still has terrible dangers. Germany is an inseparable part of Europe. If Germany adopts a federal system and gives up local decentralization, it will make Europe also tend to a federal organization. The forces tending towards unity have already become stronger among the people, while they are weaker among the governments. This is one of the solutions proposed by many leaders of the Western occupation zone. These leaders are temporary. The second election will be able to explain the real situation better than the first election, but before the traffic between the East and the West is established and foreign political control is relaxed, the real trend of the people will not be expressed. The direction of this trend, what kind of country Germany will be, which is reborn from destruction, will mainly be determined by the conditions of the four powers' agreement and the relationship between the four powers.</p>
<p>A German Christian Democratic leader in Berlin said: One of our hopes is that the German question will not separate the Soviet Union and the Western powers. But the future of the country will not be entirely determined by the conquerors. Even in the state of division, Germany itself will be a factor participating in the decision. Germany is not a four-sided problem but a five-sided struggle. Everyone is watching all the developments with excitement, because the next chapter of history has begun.

<h3>Churchill's Motion: No Confidence in the Government; Internal Disagreement Within the Labour Party</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 8th] Prime Minister Attlee again encountered a "rebellion" by more than 100 Labour MPs today. These people demanded that the current military strength of more than one million people be reduced by half in order to increase the number of domestic workers. At the same time, Conservative Party leader Churchill demanded that the House of Commons vote no confidence in the Labour Party's socialist industrial revival plan, thereby overthrowing the Labour Party government. The rebellious Labour MPs had previously expressed dissatisfaction with Foreign Secretary Bevin's policies, and were not colluding with the impeachment case proposed by Churchill. Attlee has agreed to listen to their opinions at the Labour Party primary meeting next Monday. British Liberal Party MPs have always supported the current government's foreign policy. When economic policies are discussed next week, they will support the Conservative Party's impeachment case. The Liberal Party has a total of nine MPs in the House of Commons who have signed a motion severely criticizing the current government for failing to properly handle the industrial crisis.</p>

<h3>Council Passes 36th Annual Budget: Revenue of 240 Billion; Decision to Continue Collecting Municipal Construction Donations; Suggests the Municipal Government Live Within Its Means and Make Every Effort to Economize</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The municipal budget issue, which the Municipal Council has devoted great efforts to investigating and deliberating and which the Municipal Government urgently hopes to resolve, was finally passed in the 20th meeting of the general assembly yesterday with a part of the revenue. The general assembly also passed the continuation of the collection of municipal construction donations, which is estimated to collect more than 28.9 billion yuan this year, so the total revenue is 242,800,341.722 yuan. (Including the decision to collect more than 260 million yuan for health, education, and cultural expenses.)</p>
<p>As for the expenditure budget, the council requested the municipal government to re-compile and allocate the expenditure budget, taking into account the "living within its means" principle and without hindering the progress of constructive undertakings, in accordance with the city center plan, and submit it to the council's third general assembly for deliberation. At the same time, the 11 points that the budget and final accounts committee suggested the municipal government pay close attention to were also amended and passed by the general assembly. After discussing and resolving other proposals, the second general assembly was adjourned at 6:00 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<p>Before the council discussed the budget yesterday, Li Wenjie, the representative of the budget and final accounts committee, first reported on the review process. This report was extremely detailed and well-organized.</p>
<p>Eleven Suggestions to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>The committee also made 11 suggestions to the municipal government to improve the municipal government's administration, which are (1) The Finance Bureau should effectively supervise tax collectors to eliminate embezzlement and prevent tax evasion. (2) The affiliated institutions that should be merged and the personnel that can be laid off mentioned in the inspection reports of the various committees should be paid close attention to. (3) Personnel expenditures are too large, so personnel in the general affairs, personnel statistics, and other departments of various units should be effectively reduced. (4) The number of workers in various units should be reduced. The ratio of one worker for every four employees must be maintained. (5) Abolish or merge branch institutions. (6) If the 7.2 billion yuan for in-service training of primary and secondary school teachers is included in the budget, the amount spent on education and culture should maintain a total of 20% of the expenditures. (7) If social members are willing to privately fund the construction of roads and rename them in memory of them, and voluntarily fund the construction of roads, etc., they can be adopted. (8) The Civil Affairs Office is in charge of the conscription expenses and should send a special letter to the central government for compensation. (9) If the school buildings of newly added schools under the Education Bureau have not yet been found, this amount should be transferred to the construction funds of established schools first. (10) Stop any unnecessary or temporarily delayed expenditures. For example, there are only 8,000 privately owned cars in the city, while the city government and various bureaus have a total of 599 cars, so they should be specially and effectively reduced to save on repair and grease expenses. (11) The revenue that should have been collected but has not been collected in the past year should be listed as the use of this year.</p>
<p>The budget plan, which 4 million citizens of the city care about, has come to an end. In addition, in order to build a great Shanghai, the general assembly has another resolution, explaining the reasons, intending to request assistance from the central government, and proposing three methods: (1) Request the central government to allocate special funds, (2) Request the central government to allocate assistance from the proceeds of the disposal of enemy and puppet industries in the city, (3) Request the central government to approve the retention of the funds that the city should pay to the central government under the land price tax, field tax, land value-added tax, and business tax to be used for assistance.</p>
<h3>Municipal Construction Donation Collection Issue: Only One Person Expressed Opposition</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the issue of municipal construction donations, the majority of the general assembly yesterday passed the continuation of the collection. The total annual budget is 28,916,000,000.00 yuan. About a dozen councilors spoke on this case. Except for Zhang Zhongyuan, who opposed the collection and proposed to change it to a road construction donation, the rest all agreed to the collection. However, everyone expressed slightly different opinions.</p>
<h3>Refund Academic Training Fees; Organize Municipal Fire Protection Committee; A Batch of Proposals Resolved in the Twelfth Meeting</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In addition to passing the municipal budget revenue and municipal construction donations yesterday, the general assembly also resolved many other proposals: (1) The case proposed by Wang Jian'e that "the use license tax for privately owned cars and freight cars should be levied according to the amount collected before the war" was approved in principle by the Finance Committee and submitted to the general assembly for discussion on the multiple to be added. As a result of the debate, it was still submitted to the Finance Committee for review. (2) Proposed by Xi Yushu et al., telegraphing the Executive Yuan to approve the allocation of two generators from Japanese compensation, totaling 100,000 kilowatts of electricity, for the use of this city. And proposed that the municipal government approve the establishment of a Shanghai United Electricity Company by the various power plants in the city, which was passed. (3) The 7.2 billion yuan for the academic training fees of primary and secondary school teachers in the city should be included in the municipal government's expenditure budget for this year, and those who have already collected it from students should be refunded. (4) It is proposed that representatives from the municipal government, municipal party department, municipal council, police bureau, fire department, privately-run fire brigade, local associations, agricultural, industrial, and commercial associations, education association, and insurance industry association be organized to form the municipal fire protection committee. (5) Request the financial partner to quickly amend the gold jewelry handling method. (6) Suggest that the competent authority concentrate conscripted young men in the city for training at a suitable location in the city. (7) Request the central government to retain the right of provincial, county, and city councils to request the central government's agencies stationed in the provinces, cities, and counties to attend meetings and report and question them during council meetings. (8) Request the municipal government to strictly ban and punish the principals of private primary and secondary schools in the city who do not comply with the regulations of the authorities and arbitrarily set up various names and raise the amount of fees. (9) Request that the site of the enemy loyalty tower on Jiangwan Road be rebuilt into Yingshi Park. (10) Send a telegram to all councils across the country to express opposition to international intervention in order to safeguard sovereignty. (11) Suggest that the central government rescue the industrial crisis and submit a concise method. (12) Each district office shall be responsible for the education in its jurisdiction. (13) The government should quickly send back Japanese people retained by various industrial group organs. Technical personnel who must be used should also be strictly managed. (14) The construction of roads and other buildings in each district shall be determined by the district itself, and the labor will be determined by the district itself. The Engineering Department will design and guide it to reduce the city government's expenditure. (15) Suggest that the central government and the municipal government sort out various old debts and determine a reasonable repayment method. The legal proposal will be submitted to the Finance Committee to formulate detailed methods for discussion at the next general assembly.</p>
<p>The three cases submitted by the speaker were resolved after deliberation: (1) The Nanjing Municipal Council suggested that the councils of all provinces and cities send representatives to hold a temporary joint meeting, which will be discussed at the next general assembly. (2) Approved the suggestion of the Shanghai Cultural and Sports Committee to rebuild the former Japanese shrine into a martyr. (3) The municipal government forwarded to the central government that the first batch of materials for Japanese compensation will be transported to China, and requested that the losses of private schools be included in the priority list.</p>
<h3>Huang Hanliang Failed to Appear After Summons; The District Prosecutor's Office Issued an Arrest Warrant; He Qishen and Others Returned to Beijing to Report on the Investigation</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The case of illegal gold and banknote transactions by Huang Hanliang, a person in charge of the China Xingye Bank, was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office by the Garrison Command. The handling prosecutor has issued summons several times, but Huang has not appeared. Therefore, an arrest warrant has been issued a few days ago. It is reported that Huang has already left Shanghai to avoid it. If the District Prosecutor's Office cannot arrest him in the short term, it will consider issuing an arrest warrant.</p>
<p>Gao Fang, Deputy Director of the Audit Office of the Central Bank, and He Qishen, a Counselor of the Ministry of Finance, were ordered by the Ministry of Finance to come to Shanghai to inspect the accounts of various banks and villages. They have been here for three weeks. A total of 44 banks and villages have been sampled. It was found that there were some questions about some of the accounts. Now the two have gathered all the documents and rolls they have sampled and will take the night express to Beijing to report to the Ministry of Finance. They are scheduled to return to Shanghai in three days.</p>
<h3>If the Index Is Not Restored, Society Will Lose Stability; Ten Councilors Jointly Proposed to Unfreeze; Heated Debate After Submitting to the Social Committee for Review</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] A heated debate was sparked at the Council General Assembly yesterday over the discussion of unfreezing the cost-of-living index. The case was proposed by Councilor Shui Xiangyun and jointly signed by Zhou Xuexiang, Lu Yin Chu and ten others, proposing to forward it to the central government to restore the cost-of-living index for workers from April of this year. The reason is that the already rising prices have made workers unable to bear the burden, and the accumulated raw materials and finished products of the capitalists have become inversely proportional. If prices continue to rise and the cost-of-living index is frozen from January, it is unreasonable in many ways. Although there are subsidies for the price difference of six kinds of daily necessities, the procedures are cumbersome and the distribution is unfair. Not only do workers have a strong reaction, but even factories such as the Shanghai Branch of the China Industrial Association also express opposition. If this continues, if the cost-of-living index is not restored, there will be many disputes, which will not only affect production, but also cause social instability. Shui Xiangyun also added that the compilation of the cost-of-living index includes 54 items, but the current price difference is only calculated according to six items. The workers have not received the price difference subsidy for the other 48 items. On February 2, all those who calculated the cost-of-living index received a subsidy of 73,000 yuan, and there was no difference for those with high technical skills. This cannot encourage work efficiency, and outstanding workers have lazy work. Although this decree was promulgated by the central government, if it does not work, the Council has the need to suggest that the central government make revisions.</p>
<h3>Vigorously Calling for the Protection of Lease Rights; Demolishing Houses and Evicting Tenants in the Central District; What Do Councilors Mean?</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Houses at No. 1230, No. 1232, No. 1234, and No. 1230 Lane A, Zhengdong East Road, were demolished by the landlord yesterday, forcing tenants to move out, which caused disputes.</p>
<p>The above four houses include 18 households. When the landlord Qiaoyuan Tai Woodworking Shop sent more than 40 workers with legal currency to implement it at 10 a.m. yesterday, the 18 households were forced to move their furniture to the sidewalk by the roadside. At the same time, the workers also broke through the roof, forcing the tenants to have no choice but to re-enter. After the tenants' representatives petitioned the District Court, the execution was stopped at 3:00 p.m., but the doors and windows were all removed, leaving only a frame.</p>
<p>When reporters went to inspect late at night, many tenants were still living on the streets. The broken furniture was still piled up messily on the street. According to the tenants, when the house was demolished, Dong Ruiren, a woman in confinement in No. 1234, was injured in the head by falling bricks and tiles from the roof. They also said: "We will definitely go to the Council to petition." It was found that the Council was enthusiastically discussing the issue of protecting tenants' lease rights the day before the second general assembly, but this unfortunate event was publicly performed on Zhengdong East Road, which is not a remote area, and was filmed by American reporters, which is regrettable.</p>
<h3>If Chickens Are Finished, Where Do Eggs Come From? The Deputy Speaker Said So</h3>
<p>Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing, upon hearing the statement, expressed his opinion, saying that the government, facing imminent economic collapse, is using emergency measures to rescue the situation, attempting to suppress prices through political power. Although the compilation of the cost of living index includes fifty-six items, many of them are not essential. After this freeze, subsidies will be provided for the price differences of six daily necessities: rice, oil, sugar, coal balls, and cotton cloth. The set prices are generally sufficient to purchase the goods. If prices rise again next month, the difference will still be subsidized. The government has come up with these emergency measures in a state of panic, and it is hoped that all sectors will support them. Otherwise, if the chicken is finished, there will absolutely be no more eggs produced. He hoped that the assembly would seriously discuss this proposal without favoring any one side.</p>
<p>Xu Jiqing Speaks Out Loud (Photograph by This Newspaper)</p>
<p>Who Caused High Prices?</p>
<p>Labor Senator Zhang Zhusan stood up and said: Is the responsibility for fueling high prices caused by workers' wages or by merchants? Now, freezing the cost of living index, which deviates from actual needs, can society be stabilized? Furthermore, the fundamental issue is whether the cost of living index affects prices, or whether prices affect the cost of living index, which should be clearly determined. Zhou Xuexiang said: After this index freeze, the subsidy method for workers, regardless of whether they are skilled or ordinary workers, is the same, which he believes is not very fair.</p>
<p>Zhou Xuexiang's Expression While Speaking (Photograph by This Newspaper)</p>
<p>Social Stability Depends on Cooperation</p>
<p>Fei Shusheng said: Emergency measures are to cope with extraordinary times, which is still a good method in the absence of other options. The government treats officials, farmers, workers, and merchants equally, without discrimination. We should look at how workers' wages compare with those before the war. And look at the current treatment of public school teachers? Social stability depends on cooperation from all levels. If only workers' lives are resolved, while the lives of public school teachers, soldiers, and police are not, then society still cannot be stable. Now, we only need to seek the accuracy and reasonableness of the differential subsidies, and seek the convenience of the procedures.</p>
<p>Tao Baichuan Proposes Freezing the Unfreezing Proposal</p>
<p>Tao Baichuan then spoke, saying: This is a major issue, and both sides have reasons. I suggest not putting it to a vote, but "freezing" this proposal to unfreeze the cost of living index and postponing it to the next general meeting for discussion. Because the plan issued by the government is a whole, freezing the cost of living index is only one part of it. Overthrowing it now is like deflating a large ball, and the entire plan will be destroyed. If the plan cannot save the economic crisis, it will fail in two or three months. We cannot ignore the suffering of workers' lives, then "when impoverished, one must change; change leads to success," and there will be a reasonable solution. Li Hua then loudly cried out: The price of labor in exchange for wages is a due right, so he demanded the unfreezing. Lu Yinchu said: When the government's emergency order comes down, workers should grit their teeth and endure, but it is necessary to pay attention to one point: can prices be suppressed? This loophole should be suggested to the central government for correction and remedy. Yuan Zhaoxin also advocated unfreezing.</p>
<h3>Second Congress Closes, Speaker and Mayor Give Speeches, Hoping to Live Within Means, The Future Still Faces Three Difficulties</h3>
<p>The second congress held a closing ceremony. After performing the formalities, Chairman Pan, the speaker, delivered a closing speech, briefly stating: The most important issue on the agenda of the second congress was the city budget. For the sake of prudence and comprehensive consideration, the congress was extended for two months to investigate and inspect the situation of various bureaus and units of the municipal government, and was reviewed by the budget and final accounts committee to obtain a reasonable decision. In this period of soaring prices, it is difficult to ensure that everything will remain unchanged throughout the year, and the key lies entirely in prices. Therefore, we can only decide on revenue based on the extent to which citizens can afford it. The congress decided on a revenue of over two thousand four hundred billion, and I believe that the mayor and the bureau directors who participated in the meeting can all appreciate the painstaking efforts of the senators. When re-compiling the expenditure budget, within the principle of living within our means and without affecting necessary expenditures, please refer to our opinions.</p>
<p>At the same time, Speaker Pan expressed his apologies to all citizens of the city, saying that he feared he could not fully reflect or represent their opinions, but believed that the discussion of the proposals was for the sake of building Shanghai, rather than solely for the sake of one person, one district, or one profession. Finally, he hoped that the municipal government would, to the greatest extent possible, live within its means within the scope of the budget for this year, so that citizens would not complain about the huge budget passed by the congress.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu then delivered a speech, expressing his gratitude on behalf of the municipal government to the city council for its hard work in solving difficulties for the municipal government, but said that, observing the future, there were still three difficulties: (1) Although revenue has been decided, expenditure also requires great effort. However, we are determined to follow the opinions of the council. (2) If prices can be stabilized, not only can the budget be resolved, but also the livelihood of the people can be resolved. We hope that the council can assist the municipal government in finding ways to suppress prices. (3) Only after the entire Shanghai is stable can we talk about other things. At this time of national instability, this work must be borne jointly by the senators and every citizen. Senator Feng Youzhen delivered a reply on behalf of the senators, also saying that it was very difficult for his colleagues to discuss the budget, and he hoped that the municipal government could ensure that the taxes paid by the citizens' blood and sweat would be used for public purposes. After the speech, the congress adjourned at half past six.</p>
<h3>Cotton Mill Workers Petition in Three Districts</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Thirteen representatives from various industrial unions in the cotton spinning industry in the three districts went to the council yesterday to petition, putting forward the following demands: (1) Hoping to unfreeze the index. (2) The government should stabilize prices as soon as possible. (3) The differential subsidies for child laborers, apprentices, and temporary workers should be treated equally. (4) For those who are provided meals by the factory, the differential subsidy should be issued in full, except for the deduction of the individual's portion. (5) The differential subsidy for February should be issued first. (6) Allocate supplies in kind.</p>
<h3>The Ross Liner Opens for Tours</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Ross Liner of the Java Shipping Company arrived in port on the 7th. Yesterday afternoon, it invited Hakka guests and members of the press for a tour and reception on board.</p>
<h3>The Original Proposer Clarifies His Identity</h3>
<p>The original proposer, Shui Xiangyun, then made a supplement, declaring that he was not proposing this proposal in the capacity of a worker representative, but was speaking from the position of a senator. Reading today's Shen Bao, he learned that the Ministry of Social Affairs is drafting measures for evaluating wages, so he hoped to reflect the workers' demands to the central government and make remedies when drafting the measures for evaluating wages. Speaker Pan also expressed his opinion, believing that the plan issued by the government is a whole, and it is not good to rashly overturn it now. For the sake of prudence, the case was handed over to the Social Affairs Committee for review. After a majority vote, the debate ended.</p>
<h3>Labor-Capital Dispute Arises From the Calculation of Differential Subsidies in Four Factories</h3>
<p>Four factories, namely China United Weaving Factory, Zhongyuan Weaving Factory, Minguang Weaving Factory, and Jifeng Cotton Weaving Factory, had disputes over the method of calculating the differential subsidies for essential daily necessities, resulting in strikes yesterday. Upon hearing the news, the Social Affairs Bureau immediately sent personnel to mediate and ordered the workers to resume work first, and then mediate according to law.</p>
<h3>District Attorney Continues to Question Witnesses in Huang Bohui Shooting Case</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In the "shooting" case of Huang Bohui, the former owner of the Times, the District Attorney's Office yesterday summoned witnesses Xu Wenhua (neighbor), Chen Junqian (plainclothes police chief who investigated the case), Du Guozhen, and Li Kun (both policemen) for questioning.</p>
<h3>Daily Power Shortage Totals 60,000 Kilowatts</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] As the City Council is discussing the city's power shortage problem, the American-owned Shanghai Power Company has made an accurate assessment of the current situation. It believes that the current power shortage in the city is 60,000 kilowatts per day. If the 60,000 kilowatts of power were used for industry, it could employ 90,000 unemployed workers. If the income were based on the January index of this year, the total monthly wages would reach 39 million national currency. At the same time, the labor of 90,000 workers could produce cotton cloth or other consumer goods worth 211 million yuan per month, which is equivalent to 17.6 million US dollars in terms of gold. It is worthy of the deep attention of citizens that the power shortage is not a temporary situation, and may extend to more than three years. If there is no appropriate replacement for the generators, then the power shortage may even become more severe. According to the most conservative estimate, if there is no replacement by 1951, the power shortage will reach 190,000 kilowatts, exceeding the total power generation of Shanghai today.</p>
<p>The city's power recovery plan is roughly as follows: By July of this year, the power can be increased by 33,000 kilowatts; by the end of this year, another 16,000 kilowatts can be added; next year, 42,000 kilowatts can be added, for a total of 82,000 kilowatts. However, for the sake of protecting the machines, it is imperative to adopt a rest system, which will reduce the power generation by at least 25,000 kilowatts. Therefore, the 60,000-kilowatt power shortage cannot be completely made up.</p>
<p>As the world is experiencing power shortages, even if we start ordering from foreign countries today, it will be difficult to officially receive them before 1951. Therefore, to cope with this emergency situation, it is necessary to adopt a power plant consortium system to eliminate unnecessary waste and expenses. The Shanghai Power Company has repeatedly negotiated with the Zhabei, Pudong, and Nanshi power plants, and all have agreed to this approach.</p>
<h3>Du Yuesheng's Son Marries in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Du Yuesheng's son, Wei Yuan, is marrying Ms. Yan Renwan in Hong Kong today. Du's friends Wu Zhengting, Fan Shaozeng, Xu Cheng, Lu Xiaoguang, Yang Guanbei, Gu Jiatang, etc., all flew to Hong Kong yesterday by China Airlines to offer their congratulations.</p>
<p>It is reported that Du Wei is a Master of Education from the University of Virginia in the United States. After returning to China, in addition to serving as an instructor at Zhengshi Middle School, he also served as the head of the Taishan District in this city.</p>

<h3>"Foreign Tiger" Escorted to Court, Very Calm Attitude, Arrived at Court After Dark, Detained After Interrogation, Ledgers and Other Documents Transferred in a Sack</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Maysber, general manager of the "Foreign Tiger" Ebbes Company, was transferred to the District Court by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters at 6:01 p.m. yesterday, along with all the case files and documents. After the District Court's Chief Clerk Huang Xianyu reviewed the files, he transferred them to the District Attorney's Office at 7:30 p.m. District Attorney Quan Tao, on duty, and interpreter Xu Shaoyong opened the court for interrogation, and after interrogation at 8:40 p.m., ordered him to be detained.</p>
<p>Transferred to the District Attorney's Office with Maysber was a list of stolen goods from Ebbes Company, which included: US$345,311, HK$23,050, Philippine pesos 3,300, 28 large bars of gold, US dollar bills (from the cashier's office) US$2,110, a US Treasury Department payment order, a 60,000 national currency check from Chase Bank, a checkbook from the Netherlands Bank, two notebooks (illegal gold and dollar sales were recorded in the notebooks), an entry and exit exchange book, detailed remittance accounts, a general ledger, remittance stubs, transaction slips, check or remittance application forms, remittance letters, and daily balance sheets of bank deposits and inventory, totaling 23 items, packed in a sack. There was also an accounting statistics sheet from the Garrison Headquarters, and four written records of confessions, including two from Maysber, one from Bartya, and one from Pabotista.</p>
<p>"Foreign Tiger" Maysber Escorted to Court (Photo by This Newspaper)</p>
<p>Although it was already 7:30 p.m. when Maysber arrived at the District Attorney's Office, the receiving room had heard the news early and specially kept staff members Tang Yizhi and others waiting. After the Garrison Headquarters' car arrived, Mei calmly got out of the car, carrying a large bundle wrapped in a blanket and a travel bag containing books, bread, shoes, towels, and other miscellaneous items. He told reporters that he had come to Shanghai to do business before the war and returned to Shanghai last August after being in the United States when the Pacific War broke out. As for still engaging in gold and dollar trading after the government announced the economic emergency measures, he did not know that it was illegal, but said that his legal counsel, lawyer Sellctt, could explain on his behalf.</p>
<p>Inspection Office of the Garrison Headquarters Announces Detailed Investigation Process</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Inspection Office of the Garrison Headquarters yesterday specially announced the details of the detection and investigation of the case as follows: On the first of this month, the Inspection Office received a reliable confidential report stating that there was an Ebbes Company in Room 118 of the Xinfeng Company in Sassoon House on Nanjing Road, hosted by a Dutchman named Maysber, specializing in the secret operation of gold, dollar, and foreign currency transactions. The amount of daily transactions was quite large, and all black market prices were controlled by the company. When the gold and dollar prices soared in early February, the company had planned to collect more than 2 million US dollars in advance to engage in speculative manipulation. In addition, it also engaged in black market foreign exchange, selling it on the black market to facilitate smuggling importers, and colluding with exporters to collect foreign exchange earned from exports and then sell it at a higher price. It is estimated that this figure accounts for more than two-fifths of the city's black market foreign exchange. After the economic emergency measures were announced, the company continued to operate. All of the above points have evidence and books to check, and it is requested that they be investigated and banned.</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the Inspection Office immediately dispatched cadres with the specific status of the Economic Supervision Group executing the economic emergency measures, and went to the company for a search with legal procedures. On the spot, they seized 13 copies of the company's black market cash transaction receipts, black market foreign exchange ledgers, etc., and on the same day (March 3), they bought US dollars for 14,300 yuan and sold 2,110 US dollars in cash for 14,700 yuan, as well as US dollar foreign exchange bills for 6,000 yuan. The evidence was conclusive and Maysber was proven to be a current offender. At the same time, Xu Renji, auditor from the Foreign Exchange Examination Office of the Central Bank, and Ren Gai, auditor from the Audit Office, were invited to the scene to conduct a joint study, which concluded that there was no doubt that a crime had been committed. Subsequently, stolen money was seized, including US$345,311, HK$23,050, Philippine pesos 3,300, and 380 taels of gold. Upon interrogation on the spot, Maysber and other accounting personnel admitted to illegally engaging in black market foreign currency and foreign exchange transactions. Maysber also told the investigators on the spot, "I have indeed committed a crime and dare not operate any further, but please leave some funds to disband the staff in order to handle the termination."</p>
<p>Since the crime had already been proven, the Inspection Office formally arrested the principal offender, Maysber, and took the main accounting personnel, the Portuguese Pabotista and Bartya, as well as the Chinese cashiers Shi Jiusen and Shao Shunqin, to the department for interrogation. The stolen goods (US dollars, Hong Kong dollars, gold bars, etc.) were divided into two iron boxes and sealed by the main offender himself before being handed over to the Central Bank for safekeeping. Other ledgers, etc., were taken to the Garrison Headquarters for investigation. That night, in addition to interrogating the Chinese cashiers Shi Jiusen and Shao Shunqin, and the Portuguese Bartya, and obtaining their confessions and releasing them on bail, the principal offenders Maysber and Pabotista admitted to the crime after a retrial and were detained. The company's transaction documents were examined by accountant Xie Chunpu, and after two days of calculation, it was confirmed that the company had bought a total of US$788,800 in cash foreign exchange, £193,348 in British pounds, HK$1,511,000 in Hong Kong dollars, and 4,195 Portuguese patacas during the gold rush period from February 1st to February 17th, and sold US$507,650 in US dollars, £380,633 in British pounds, HK$1,335,000 in Hong Kong dollars, and 21,500 Portuguese patacas. After the economic emergency measures were announced, the company continued to buy and sell US$310,827 in US dollars, £164,350 in British pounds, HK$90,000 in Hong Kong dollars, and A$1,000 in Australian dollars, and sell US$73,150 in US dollars, £103,023 in British pounds, HK$215,581 in Hong Kong dollars, 62,000 Portuguese patacas, and A$1,000 in Australian dollars. The total of purchases and sales since February 1st</p>
<p>The total number is already alarming</p>
<p>Those before February 1st have not yet been calculated. Adding this huge inflow and outflow, and arbitrarily exceeding the foreign currency exchange rate stipulated by the Central Bank after the promulgation of the law, operating on the black market, it is sufficient to prove that the company has disregarded the law, deliberately manipulated the black market, and disrupted the financial system. This is a special criminal case involving foreign nationals undermining our country's financial laws. In addition to Pabotista, whose preliminary examination of the books has come to an end, was granted bail first, the principal offender Maysber was transferred to the court for punishment in accordance with Article 7 of the Measures for Prohibiting the Circulation of Foreign Currency Notes within the Economic Emergency Measures Plan. According to the provisions of Article 7, "Those who violate this will be regarded as speculation and manipulation to disrupt the financial system. In addition to confiscating their banknotes and revoking their business licenses, the manager will be sentenced to imprisonment for up to five years."</p>

<h3>Dr. Hu Shi Arrives in Shanghai to Preside Over the Board of Directors of Peking Union Medical College and Will Go to Beijing to Attend the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture</h3>
<p>Dr. Hu Shi, President of National Peking University, arrived in Shanghai by US military plane the other day to preside over the Board of Directors of Peking Union Medical College and to attend the Board of Directors of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture. Yesterday, he invited the Shanghai-based directors of Peking Union Medical College to the International Hotel for a preparatory meeting. Mr. Hu told reporters yesterday that the Board of Directors of Peking Union Medical College was originally scheduled to be held in Beijing on the 12th of this month, but because most of the directors are in Shanghai, the meeting was changed to Shanghai. At that time, directors in Beijing, such as Weng Wenhao and Zhou Yichun, will also come to Shanghai to attend. Directors already in Shanghai include Liu Ruiheng, Li Ming, Chen Zhiqian, and American directors Wilson, Earle Ballou, Dean of the Science College of Yenching University, and A. M. Dumlop, professor at St. John's University. The matters to be discussed by the Board of Directors of Peking Union Medical College this time will be how to prepare for the start of the school year this autumn and the election of the president and vice president. In terms of funding, the Rockefeller Foundation of the United States originally allocated US$12 million to Peking Union Medical College, which is used with interest calculated at 3%, yielding US$660,000 per year. The school buildings were occupied by the Japanese army as a hospital during the war and were used by the Military Mediation Department after the victory. Now, representatives of the government, the Communist Party, and the United States have all moved out, and everything can be cleared within a month. Preparations will be made for receiving and repairing the buildings so that the school can open in the autumn. The damage to the buildings during the war was not significant. The Board of Directors of Peking Union Medical College held a meeting in New York last March. This will be the first meeting held in the country after the victory. Mr. Hu is the chairman of the Board of Directors of Peking Union Medical College. After the Board of Directors meeting in Shanghai on the 12th, he will take a train to Beijing to attend the Board of Directors meeting of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture, which will be held on the 14th. When reporters asked if he would become the Minister of Education as rumored, he said: "I am here purely for the revival of Peking Union Medical College and the meeting of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture. I am non-partisan and non-factional. The rumors about me becoming the Minister of Education are purely hearsay. Please do not believe them." Subsequently, reporters inquired about the household registration inspection and the investigation of private homes in Beiping. Mr. Hu said: "This matter is over. Students from Peking University and Tsinghua University went on strike for two days and then took supplementary exams to complete the process. All related school staff and students have been released, and everything is no longer a problem. The atmosphere is not tense now."</p>
<h3>Border Region Teachers Training Program to Be Established in July This Year</h3>

<h3>The Number of Quotas for the Translators Studying Abroad Examination Is Not Accurate; Spokesperson of the Ministry of Education Issues Statement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The Ministry of Education is holding a public-funded study abroad examination for translators, and registration has now begun, with a scheduled examination date. The number of quotas was approved by the Executive Yuan upon submission by the former Foreign Affairs Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission for 100 positions. Currently, there are widespread rumors that 60 of these 100 positions have already been internally designated for translators who are currently continuing their service in the United States, and another 20 positions have also been internally designated by the Ministry of Education. Therefore, in reality, there are only 20 quota positions. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Education recently issued the following statement: All translators who have served as translators in the Foreign Affairs Bureau and have obtained certificates without major faults can participate in this public-funded study abroad examination for translators. It is estimated that there are as many as 3,600 translators with this qualification. On average, one person out of every thirty-six will be selected. The Ministry of Education has decided to use the examination results as the sole criterion for selection. However, because 100 of these 3,600 people are still continuing their service in the United States and it is inconvenient for them to return to the country to participate in the examination, for fairness, 97 people will be selected in this examination, and the remaining three positions will still be reserved. Translators in the United States can apply to the Ministry of Education according to the prescribed procedures, and the Ministry will use their service performance as the selection criterion. The rumor that there are internally designated quotas is likely due to a misunderstanding.</p>

<h3>Student Aid Application Form Specified Size</h3>
<p>Mr. Zheng Jie, the Executive Secretary of the Municipal Student Aid Committee, recently told reporters: "I am very grateful that the newspapers published the student aid measures yesterday and included the application form formulated by our committee.

<h3>Municipal Bureau of Education Orders Private Schools to Complete Registration Procedures Within a Time Limit</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In order to rectify private schools, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education specially ordered all unregistered private schools yesterday to complete the registration procedures within a time limit. The order is recorded as follows: "It has been ordered repeatedly that unregistered private schools in this city should complete the registration procedures within the prescribed time limit. While many have complied with the order, there are also many who are waiting and procrastinating. Now, the previous order is reiterated.

<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>The private Minben Primary School on Yuyuan Road and Difeng Road in this city is holding a free night school to eliminate illiteracy and popularize education. Classes are held from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm every evening, and all tuition and miscellaneous fees are waived.</p>
<p>The Municipal Gezhi Middle School is celebrating its 30th anniversary. In order to celebrate, the alumni of the school have scheduled a meeting of the Alumni Association at the school on Guangxi Road at 2:00 pm this afternoon to prepare for the celebration.</p>
<p>Letter of Correction: "Having read yesterday's issue of your newspaper, which carried a news item about schools overcharging tuition fees, our school was also listed, which was quite surprising. After investigation, the tuition fees collected by our school are in full compliance with the standards set by the Municipal Council and have been filed with the Bureau of Education. The part about our school published in your newspaper is obviously based on hearsay and is in error. We request that you grant a correction."

<h3>Today's First Division Football Match: Donghua Meets the Soviet Union Again; From 3:00 pm at the Yiyuan Stadium; Mayor's Cup Shanyun vs. Jewish in the Morning</h3>
<p>There are a total of three football matches today. The main battle is the second round of the First Division, where Donghua will meet the Soviet Union again, competing at the Yiyuan Stadium at 3:00 pm. After Donghua defeated the Soviet Union 4-2 in the first round, they have won every game, creating a great record of eight wins in eight games. The First Division championship is already within reach. The outcome is irrelevant, but in order to maintain a perfect record, they will continue their efforts. Today's lineup was announced yesterday by Jia Youliang and is the same as the battle against Youyou last week, with careful deployment. On the Soviet side, the lineup is also largely the same as last week. The Soviet Union has been practicing hard for days to avenge their previous defeat and there will be a bloody battle at that time.</p>
<p>In addition to Donghua meeting the Soviet Union again today, there are also two games, the Mayor's Cup and the Third Division final, competing at Yiyuan and Jinyuan Public Park, respectively. Tickets for Yiyuan are 3,000 for the grandstand and 5,000 for the central seat, and will be sold at the gymnasium from 1:00 pm. In the Mayor's Cup, Jewish will face Shanyun at 9:30 am at Yiyuan. Jewish had a bye in the first week, and Shanyun was poisoned by Longjie in the first battle. However, Longjie had an unregistered player on the field, and the Football Committee ruled that Shanyun won 1-0, thus advancing. Today, they will meet Jewish, and it may be difficult to preserve their victory. In the Third Division final, the Customs will face Jingwu at 10:00 am at Jinyuan Park, which is a total elimination match for the group. Today's schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Donghua - Soviet Union First Division 3:00 pm Yiyuan Referee Chen Jixiang, Linesmen Yue Xiurong and He Chunhui</p>

<h3>Beijing Elementary and Middle Schools to Form a Sports Research Association</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The National Sports Commission of the Ministry of Education and the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Education held a symposium for physical education teachers in elementary and middle schools at the Ministry of Education at 3:00 pm on the afternoon of the 8th, with more than 130 attendees, chaired by Hao Gengsheng. It was resolved to form a Beijing Elementary and Middle School Sports Research Association to study and improve physical education teaching materials and methods, and seven physical education teachers from municipal elementary and middle schools were designated to draft measures, and a founding meeting will be held in two weeks.</p>
<h3>The Green Team Went to Beijing Last Night</h3>
<p>The Green Team, the women's basketball champion of this city, went to Beijing at the invitation of the Nanjing Lizhi Society to compete with the Lizhi Women's Basketball Team. The team of twelve people, led by Xie Yiqin, left by express train at 11:00 pm last night. It is expected to arrive safely in the capital at 7:00 am this morning, and will compete with the Lizhi team at 3:00 pm this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Football Committee Explains Resolutions</h3>
<p>The Football Committee has made some supplements to the resolutions of the 21st Standing Committee meeting that were published the other day and has explained Article 22 of the League Regulations. Recorded below:</p>
<p>(Resolution) During the Qingbai vs. Railway Mayor's Cup match on March 1, many railway uniformed employees rushed into the field across the fence because they were dissatisfied with the referee's decision, shouting, scolding, and hitting, disturbing the order of the field. This is a betrayal of the spirit of sports and a letter should be sent to the Railway Administration to be responsible for stopping it in the future in order to maintain the progress of the game. Otherwise, the team's game schedule will not be arranged temporarily.</p>
<p>(Explanation) Article 22 of the League Regulations: "Players registered in a certain group can attend the games of their team's senior group, but after the player has participated in the senior game twice, they are only allowed to represent the senior team in the game during the same season and are not allowed to return." Originally a specific regulation to restrict the promotion and demotion of players in the league (for the same club with two or more teams participating in the game), the cup game uses an elimination system, and the number of games decided by each team is uncertain. Clubs with A and B teams have no linked relationship. Moreover, the Mayor's Cup and the Junior Cup can be held separately, and members of Groups B and C can participate in the Mayor's Cup game. Therefore, in the minutes of the 21st decision meeting of the Football Committee, "Article 22 of the League Regulations does not apply to the Cup" is purely an explanation of the nature to the outside world and has no meaning to change the regulations.</p>
<p>Railway Sports Association Letter Reply to the Football Committee</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Employees Sports Association replied to the Football Committee on March 7, stating: "We have always strived to maintain and abide by the spirit of sports, sportsmanship, and regulations. On that day, the players of our team did not express any objection to the penalty of 12 yards. The spectators on the field expressed their opinions from the standpoint of objective fairness. The referee may have been negligent and revealed it in words, but it is not something that our team can advise on. Moreover, on that day, employees of the Railway Bureau accounted for only one-tenth of the number of spectators, and there were no unsatisfactory words or deeds. Therefore, we are not able to admit the various sections in your letter. Regarding the issue of order at the venue, our team participates in the game, and based on sportsmanship, we cooperate to maintain it. However, the responsibility for maintaining order at the venue still lies with your association, and our association is not convenient to act on its behalf. As for the arrangement of the game schedule, the right lies with your association, and our association does not dare to advise."</p>

<h3>U.S. Troops Adamant About Not Conceding Defeat: Chinese Alliance to Battle Columbus Again; Clash at Gymnasium Tonight at 7 PM</h3>
<p>The U.S. Navy's Columbus basketball team engaged in a friendly match with Shanghai's Chinese champions, the Chinese Alliance team, the night before last. The contest was intense and exciting, with the Chinese Alliance ultimately winning a hard-fought victory of 41 to 35. The foreign troops, unwilling to accept defeat, issued a rematch challenge. With the Chinese Alliance's agreement, a second clash is scheduled for 7 PM this evening at the same venue. Referees will be Qu Honglu and Liu Hesheng, and ticket prices remain unchanged.</p>
<p>The Chinese Alliance fully demonstrated its fighting spirit the night before last. Great Li commanded the three armies, with the five tigers coordinating their actions. The entire team displayed seamless teamwork. Although the Columbus team is just one team from a warship, its strength is formidable. Among the foreign troops in Shanghai, it can be considered a behemoth. Coupled with their height, long arms, and clear minds, they are indeed a formidable opponent for the Chinese Alliance. In today's encounter, the foreign troops aim to avenge their previous defeat and are expected to deliver an even more spectacular performance. Chinese Alliance captain Kong Guangyi followed the Green Team to Beijing yesterday, but Ren Xiangcheng is available to take his place, so there should be no impact. The lineup for today's battle is recorded below:</p>
<p>[Chinese Alliance Team] Li Zhenzhong, Wu Chengzhang, Bao Songtong, Chen Xuechong, Ren Xiangcheng, Zhuo Guorong, Zhang Liangxiong.</p>
<p>[Columbus] Bosak, Grafford, Ash, Poeppel, Raies, Qu Linghuotuo, Ke Luoning, Oberon, Burke, Wass, Rumm, Blun, Joe Qu'er, Rasi, Kloss.</p>

The players are all young and energetic, fearless like newborn tigers. A wonderful performance is sure to follow.</p>
<p>As for Snow White and Qinglian, they are top-tier women's teams in the city. In the past, their strengths have been evenly matched, making it extremely difficult to predict who will win or lose when they meet. In recent conditions, Snow White is steadily improving, almost on par with the Green Team. Qinglian, with its star player Xu Peizhen not feeling well, is inevitably affected. Therefore, the team has enlisted the help of former teammates Wang Wuli and Jian Zhiguang, significantly boosting their strength and enabling them to compete with Snow White.

<p>[Our Correspondent] The billiards final between Zhu Qiliang and Lin Shikang, originally scheduled for yesterday afternoon at the Chuo Er Si Billiards Room, could not be held due to the excessive number of spectators and the lack of viewing facilities.

<h3>Outlets for Floating Capital Increasingly Narrow; Securities Market Gains Momentum; Both Chinese and Foreign Stocks See Enthusiastic Inquiries</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks rose yesterday after a period of mostly stable trading. While sentiment was good, bank selling at higher prices slightly curbed the gains, and previously popular stocks also saw their trading range narrow. The market opened strong this morning due to news that listed stocks could be used as reserves for savings deposits, resulting in unusually robust sentiment. Delivery orders appeared, with numbers 85, 207, 117, 203, 199, 218, 152, 2, 14, 32, and 178 being sold off from 3,000 yuan down to 2,850 yuan. Numbers 198, 97, 22, and 185 were bought low. Number 32 bought Xian Yong Yarn and rebounded. However, Guohuo (domestic goods), under number 73, Zhaowu under number 171, and Xinhua under number 115, were limit-up, with numbers 35, 235, 224, 218, 160, 197, 89, and 142 eagerly snapped up, rebounding to 3,020 yuan. Numbers 207, 95, 20, 83, 35, and 102 sold, and after 11 AM, the situation gradually stabilized. Number 105 was also sold and fell to 2,920 yuan. Numbers 198, 223, 160, and 152 maintained their positions by buying low and recovered to 2,980 yuan. Numbers 65 and 2231 were still selling, seeing 2,930 yuan. After struggling, numbers 32 and 14 both bought, and number 137 bought current delivery orders, closing at around 2,970 yuan at noon. As a result, compared to the previous close, Xian Yong Yarn, Xinhe, Qinxing, Huafeng, and Xinguang each rose by about half a percent. Meiya and Zhongfa rose by 10%, Jingfu rose slightly, and Xinhua was limit-up. In delivery trading, Xian Yong Yarn, Xinhe, and Huafeng rose by half a percent, Meiya rose by 10%, Xinguang and Jingfu rose slightly, and the cold stocks of Shangwu, Zhongsi, Bingyi, and Guohuo all reached limit-up. Xinya alone fell by half a percent, while the rest rose by about half a percent. In over-the-counter trading, Dasheng and Shijie were flat, while the rest saw slight gains.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks</p>
<p>Yesterday, securities firms came to absorb stocks, pushing up prices. However, rubber stock prices did not change much. Guangbang sold off some holdings, and prices stabilized slightly after rising. Yisha opened at 19,300 yuan in the morning, reaching a high of 20,300 yuan, and then hovered around 19,700 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, British United, Yisha, Jardine Matheson, Yi Pi, Navigation, and Steel each rose by about half a percent, while the rest rose only slightly.</p>
<p>Government Bonds</p>
<p>There was little activity yesterday. Tongbing opened at 8,700 yuan, reaching a high of 8,800 yuan and a low of 8,300 yuan. It ultimately fluctuated between 8,700 yuan and 8,800 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Jia, Yi, and Wu all saw stability, while Bing and Ding each rose by 300 yuan, with limited trading volume.</p>
<h3>Eight Types of Government Bonds to Be Drawn Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Distribution of Yarn Based on Number of Looms, Textile Factories Categorized and Assigned</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The China Textile Construction Corporation is currently improving its yarn distribution method for dye and weave mills. It has categorized applicants for cotton yarn based on the number of their looms into four classes: Class A for those with 201 or more looms, Class B for those with 101 to 200 looms, Class C for those with 51 to 100 looms, and Class D for those with 50 or fewer looms. Yarn is distributed to the four classes in the ratio of 8:4:2:1. For example, if Class A receives 8 units, Class B receives 4, Class C receives 2, and Class D receives 1. Other manufacturers and firms will also be categorized separately.</p>
<p>In addition, the corporation sold 17,380 bolts of cloth yesterday, as usual. 295 applicants applied for 20,820 bolts.</p>
<h3>Man-Made Silk Quotations Weakening</h3>
<p>The 24th term of artificial silk for the silk weaving industry continues to be allocated. The quota for large factories is 600 cases, hence the weakness in the black market price yesterday. The opening quotation for Takayama Yu-Mitsuru No. 120 was 7.15 million yuan, and the closing price at noon was 7.05 million yuan. There were no changes in the afternoon, a decrease of 150,000 yuan compared to the previous day, but there was still a lack of transactions. Factory owners had no intention of buying due to sluggish sales of silk fabrics, and foreign firms had no interest either due to the lack of telegraphic replies. The market situation was exceptionally quiet. Yesterday, users sold D-grade man-made silk at a quoted price of 7.6 million yuan, while ordinary others still quoted around 7.3 million yuan. The silk market was even more deserted, with quilt covers hardly attracting any attention. Dachen Gewang crepe was quoted at 17,000 yuan, but there was still a lack of buyers even at 6,600 yuan. Transactions of man-made silk goods such as Huajin crepe were also scarce. Only printed materials were relatively popular as they were required to fulfill sales orders.</p>
<h3>Vice Minister Pan Xulun Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss Cotton Yarn Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Economic Affairs Vice Minister Pan Xulun arrived in Shanghai from the capital yesterday morning. In the afternoon at 3 PM, he summoned Li Shengbo, Deputy Director of the Cotton Management Committee, Liu Wenteng, Director of the Business Office, Wang Zijian, Director of the Secretariat, Feng Mo, a specialist, and Jiang Dixian, Deputy Director of the Business Office of the Textile Construction Corporation, to discuss the current cotton yarn situation. The exchange of views was quite detailed. It is said that the focus of yesterday's discussions was on (1) the foreign exchange required for purchasing foreign cotton, (2) the purchase price of cotton yarn, and (3) the allocation of cotton yarn. After listening to the views of various individuals, Mr. Pan will make recommendations to the central authorities to serve as a reference when deciding on policy.</p>
<h3>Improved Absorption Capacity, Limited Cotton Yarn Trading</h3>
<p>After opening, the cotton yarn market stabilized. Subsequently, the market became firm in stability due to relatively smooth sales to actual user factories. However, there was considerable interest in 42-count yarn, but the supply was very scarce, making it difficult to open trading. 20-count, 16-count, and 42-count yarns were initially popular but then became stable, and the final results were similar to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Sentiment Stable</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market saw the Textile Construction Corporation selling 20-count fine cloth as usual yesterday, priced at 135,000 yuan, which was 7,000 yuan lower than the last quoted price. As a result, sentiment in the market was stable. Trading of 12-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth opened as low as 156,500 yuan at one point, and some dyeing and weaving mills absorbed some, but the final price was still 158,000 yuan, similar to the previous day. Wufu was 154,000 yuan, Caiqiu was 152,000 yuan, Lanji was 150,000 yuan, and Zharuan was 120,000 yuan. Market conditions for other colored cloths and Shilin serge were also stable.</p>
<h3>Salt Administration Bureau States Three Reasons for Exporting Salt to Japan</h3>
<p>Regarding the export of Chinese salt to Japan, the industrial sector has criticized the government on the grounds of maintaining China's chemical industry. According to the Salt Administration Bureau, the reasons for exporting salt to Japan are threefold: (1) to find an outlet for surplus salt domestically, alleviating the livelihood difficulties of salt farmers, (2) to exchange for materials needed domestically, and (3) to prevent salt farmers from smuggling, thereby hindering tax revenue. As for China's chemical industry, it is unable to consume this huge amount of salt in the short term. Therefore, the government has no choice but to export an appropriate amount. If Japan does not obtain salt from China, it can also obtain comparable amounts of salt from other sources such as the Red Sea and Burma. However, this year's salt production is less than expected, and adjustments will be made at any time, with the principle of exporting only surpluses. 300,000 dan of salt from the Taiwan salt region will also be shipped to Japan successively. 60,000 dan from Fuzhou were loaded onto ships for export last week.</p>
<h3>Various Industries Draft Nine Measures, Requesting the Formation of a Raw Material Import Review Committee to Uniformly Review the Raw Material Needs of Various Factories</h3>

Nine proposed measures were drafted as follows:</p>
<p>(1) A raw material import review committee shall be established by the trade associations of various industries. All factories within the industrial scope, whether state-owned, privately owned, or foreign-owned, shall have their required imported raw materials uniformly reviewed by the review committee.</p>
<p>(2) The duties of the raw material import review committee shall be as follows:</p>
<p>A. Investigate the quantity of various raw materials required annually by each industry and the current inventory of various raw materials in each industry's factories.</p>
<p>B. Review whether the raw materials should be imported.</p>
<p>C. Review whether the quantity of raw materials applied for import by each industry's factory is appropriate.</p>
<p>D. Promote domestic raw materials. If domestic goods can be substituted, import shall not be approved.</p>
<p>E. Issue certification documents for factories in each industry applying to import raw materials.</p>
<p>F. Assist the Import Management Committee regarding raw material import matters.</p>
<p>(3) The Import Management Committee's approval of raw material imports shall be based on the certification documents of the raw material import review committees of various industries. Otherwise, no foreign exchange settlement or import shall be approved.</p>
<p>(4) The Import Management Committee may send personnel to participate in the raw material import review committees of various industries.</p>
<p>(5) If the Import Management Committee believes that there are objections to the raw material import certification documents submitted by the review committee, it may return them to the review committee for reconsideration.</p>
<p>(6) The raw materials imported by factories in various industries shall be used only for manufacturing goods and shall not be hoarded or sold privately, but the transfer among colleagues shall not be limited by this.</p>
<p>(7) The raw material import review committee shall invite relevant industries to participate together for joint review, or the relevant industry associations shall jointly organize a review committee.</p>
<p>(8) Factories in various industries may organize a raw material import cooperative to uniformly handle the import and distribution of raw materials for each industry. The government shall assist and supervise it, and the methods shall be prescribed separately.</p>
<p>(9) The details of imported goods decided upon by the raw material import review committee of each industry shall be published in the newspaper from time to time to solicit criticism, so that corrections can be made at any time. The above measures outline the general principles. If they are adopted and implemented, there will be six benefits. However, at the same time, strict restrictions should be imposed on the import of finished products, and imports should be prohibited unless absolutely necessary. Smuggling should also be effectively curbed, which will make the results easier to achieve. (Omitted below)</p>
<h3>Rice Market Remains Sluggish, Flour Prices Decline with Few Buyers</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the total source of rice in the rice market was about 11,000 shi, with sluggish sales. Japonica rice gradually declined, with both middle, lower-grade southern and northern japonica rice seeing continued declines of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Indica rice trading was slack and listless. Baiyuan was stable, while Yinyuan raised its price.</p>
<p>The Oil Market Society Bureau strictly prohibited market prices from exceeding the negotiated price, so trading in the market was limited. Only refined oil trading rose slightly by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. It is heard that soybean oil and raw oil are firm in the over-the-counter market due to the scarcity of goods from Qingdao. The supply and demand of soybean cake were both low, and the market was flat.</p>
<p>Flour prices gradually declined, dropping by another 1,000 yuan, with few buyers, making it difficult to improve the situation. Bran prices dropped by 1,000 yuan, with sluggish sales, making it difficult to be optimistic.</p>
<p>Foreign merchants digested yellow beans in the street, continuing to rise by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Mung beans fell back by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. High-quality raw kernels were stable, while middle and lower-quality kernels fell by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Sesame was firm, red beans turned firm, and kernel grains were fair. Corn from Qingdao moved again, weakening and then strengthening, rebounding by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was relatively stable, with occasional rebounds. The association set the price of No. 22 medium white sand at 185,500 yuan. No. 24 group white sand was at 213,000 to 215,000 yuan. The spot price for the eighth term three-and-a-half car white sugar was 188,000 yuan. The price for the same goods in the ninth term was 182,000 yuan, which then dropped to 180,000 yuan, and then rebounded to 181,000, 182,500, and 183,000 yuan. The spot price for Miyan fine sand rose from 185,000 to 186,000 yuan to 187,000 to 189,000 yuan. Shantou refined sugar rose by 5,000 yuan, with several hundred bags trading at 130,000 yuan to 129,000 yuan. Diao refined sugar rose by 2,000 yuan, opening at several hundred bags at 126,000 yuan, followed by 124,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office Investigates Two Types of Industrial Raw Materials: Stearic Acid and Precipitated Calcium Carbonate</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Since our government adopted the import licensing system, the supply of industrial raw materials in this city has also been affected. The Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office has specially dispatched staff to various factories to conduct on-site investigations of the production and sales situation of various industrial raw materials, so as to actively promote the self-sufficiency plan for industrial raw materials. The office has now investigated two types of raw materials: stearic acid and precipitated calcium carbonate. The investigation process is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Stearic Acid: In this city, it is mostly used as a raw material for candles, cosmetics, skin creams, etc. The annual usage in this city is 250 tons (equivalent to 5,000 dan) for the cosmetics industry, 150 tons (equivalent to 3,000 dan) for the rubber industry, and 300 tons (equivalent to 6,000 dan) for the candle industry. However, as the candle industry has stagnated, the actual usage is only 8,000 dan. Currently, there is only one factory in this city producing stearic acid, with an annual production of 7,200 dan. However, the current actual production is only half of that. If expansion is implemented, production can be increased to 12,000 dan within three months, which is sufficient for the entire country. It is hoped that the government can provide assistance so that the production and sales issues of stearic acid can be resolved.</p>
<p>Precipitated Calcium Carbonate: In this city, it is mostly used in the rubber and cosmetics industries. There are 72 rubber factories in this city, with a monthly need for 17,395 tons of rubber, but the actual usage is less than 1,000 tons. With 1,500 tons being estimated for rubber usage in other cities, the monthly usage of precipitated calcium carbonate is 2,000 tons, which is 20,000 tons per year. The cosmetics industry uses 1,600 tons of precipitated calcium carbonate per year, totaling 21,600 tons for both. The current price is 5 million yuan per ton, with a total value of 108 billion yuan. There are a total of five calcium carbonate manufacturing factories in this city, which can produce 24 tons per day, approximately 7,200 tons per year, only one-third of the total consumption. Therefore, there is an urgent need to expand production to balance production and sales. It was also found that the industry needs cheap white coal and sufficient electricity. At the same time, imports of foreign goods should be restricted to stimulate production in the industry.</p>
<h3>2.5 Million Pounds of Chinese Tea Approved for Export to the UK</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] According to local Chinese tea importers, it is estimated that most of the 2.5 million pounds of Chinese tea approved for import by the end of this month have already been purchased. Import permits are expected to be issued soon to continue importing Chinese tea.</p>
<h3>Export Tea Transactions Rare</h3>
<p>The attention of English factories is focused on black tea for export. Yesterday, the market still saw few transactions due to a lack of agreement between buyers and sellers. As for green tea varieties, since the export merchants in this city learned that some of the old stock from previous years was of lower quality and not welcomed abroad, they are now unwilling to inquire about it, resulting in a quieter market. However, there is frequent consideration given to green tea from the 34th and 35th years, but unfortunately, the prices offered do not meet the buyers' expectations, leading to largely unsuccessful negotiations and very mediocre transactions. Only Wu Chang, Dade Chang, Hua Cha, and other companies are still making purchases, and the market remains stable. Domestic sales of red and green tea are rarely exciting, and there is little fluctuation in sentiment.</p>
<h3>Electric Bulb Prices Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to electrical goods merchants: the price of electric bulbs is soaring due to the cessation of tungsten filament supply and frequent increases in material and labor costs. The market is very hot. 220V40W GE bulbs are selling for 15,000 yuan each, Apur for 14,000 yuan each, and Hua De for 14,000 yuan each. 220V100W GE bulbs are selling for 40,000 yuan each, Apur for 25,000 yuan each, and American ATLAS bulbs for 40,000 yuan each.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Supply from Source Uninterrupted, Market Stable with Upward Trend</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Tung oil transactions continued in small quantities over the weekend. The arrival of goods from the production areas continues unabated. Merchants are purchasing arriving goods at prices ranging from 380,000 to 400,000 yuan per dan, depending on the refractive index. Export-grade white oil is being purchased by exporters at a price of 440,000 yuan per dan without barrels, with quick barrels costing an additional 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Tung oil merchants are selling in small quantities at a price of 420,000 yuan per dan (non-export grade). There have been no deliveries from Dingxi Hongjiyingfengjiu, resulting in no goods and no market. 83-catty barrel of secondary Xihong is 390,000 yuan per barrel. Hongjiang barrel oil ranges from 250,000 to 270,000 yuan per barrel. Rural sales are becoming more active, with a stable but upward trend.</p>
<h3>Dyes Frequently Decline</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The sluggishness of the dye market over the past two weeks is unprecedented in the last half-year. According to industry insiders: sales to North China have ceased, and domestic sales are also suffering because of abundant inventories. The weight of the market price and time considerations is very heavy, and the cost of transportation is very high, so there is no demand, and transactions are extremely scarce. Over the weekend, Daqiao vermilion was priced at 200,000 yuan per can, Haitong brown at 65,000 yuan, Wuma vermilion at 350,000 yuan per can, BNC yuanqing at 90,000 yuan per can, and No. 16 dizihui at 360,000 yuan per can, all significantly lower than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Sausage Casing Market Declining</h3>
<p>Sausage casing prices are declining because foreign prices are frequently reported to be sluggish, while manufacturers' production costs are high, making it impossible to lower prices. Recently, foreign firms' demand has weakened, and the market has suddenly turned to decline. It is reported that sausage casing manufacturers are planning to request that fresh casing prices be stabilized to reduce costs. If the sausage casing industry can reduce costs, the annual export volume could reach 8,500 barrels, which, based on current New York prices, could yield more than 50 million US dollars.</p>
<h3>Oil Trade Association to Hold Inaugural Meeting Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Oil Trade Association, since being ordered to prepare for its establishment, has passed more than a month. Applications to join the association have been very enthusiastic, totaling more than 70% of the oil merchants in the city. The preparatory committee has decided to hold an inaugural meeting at the association's location on Minquan Road on the 9th of this month to elect directors and supervisors in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Bituminous Coal Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>The selling price of white coal in the coal market is still being strongly supported by the owners, so the process remains stable throughout. Bituminous coal continues the previous trend. Market prices continue to fall, especially bituminous coal dust, which has seen the most severe decline. Jilong dust is being offered at 600,000 yuan, but still lacks a buyer.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics Trade Narrows</h3>
<p>Woolen fabrics have been gradually increasing in price for the past two weeks due to various environmental factors. Currently, there is less circulation of goods in the market, and factories are facing difficulties in production. Import merchants are caught in a standstill due to the temporary import ban, foreign exchange adjustments, and further restrictions. As a result, it is difficult for fellow merchants to import goods, and sales are rebounding, with many hoarding goods. The actual sales of Chinese and Western clothing are much lower than in previous spring seasons. Therefore, the current and future import and export of woolen fabrics can be said to be entering a narrow path.</p>
<h3>The Advantages and Disadvantages of Import and Export Linking System</h3>
<p>Regarding the detailed measures of the import and export linking system, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to convene a meeting on the 10th of this month at the chamber to discuss with relevant organizations. The Import and Export Trade Association is currently drafting opinions on the measures and has notified all fellow merchants to attend the discussion at that time. Zhou Jingwei, the secretary of the association, recently analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of the import and export linking system for the industry to reporters as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In the past year, our foreign export trade has been unable to develop due to the imbalance between costs and foreign market prices. On the other hand, imports have increased many times over. This is because there is a great need for various industrial raw materials after the war, and the consumption of finished products is also large. Before the war, industrial manufactured products used only a portion of foreign raw materials, with the remaining raw materials mostly being domestic products. However, in recent years, due to inconvenient domestic transportation and the losses suffered during the eight years of war, the production of some raw materials has sharply decreased, and as a result, prices are often higher than those of foreign goods. Therefore, the quantity of imported goods has been increasing daily. The authorities feel that it is difficult to cope with the enormous influx of imports in the current situation of foreign exchange supply. Furthermore, since the implementation of the import management policy, the various industries have been deeply restricted, and their businesses are almost at a standstill. Therefore, an import and export linking system should be adopted to maintain them.</p>
<p>(2) Although the linking system is a shortcut to free trade for the import and export industry, excessive indulgence can easily lead to competition. As a result, imports and exports will inevitably lead to a surge in goods and a drop in prices, while those in the industry with greater financial resources and better access to information can manipulate and monopolize the market. Therefore, the implementation measures for this linking system still need to be carried out with measures that are neither too loose nor too tight in order to achieve any benefits.</p>
<h3>Assisting Foundries and Other Industries, Second Batch of Pig Iron Being Negotiated, Delivery Price to Shanghai Lower than Spot Price</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In order to assist the machinery, foundry, and electrical equipment industries in resolving raw material difficulties, the Mechanical and Electrical Group of the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office is actively negotiating for the purchase of low-priced pig iron and coke for various industries. Regarding pig iron, in addition to purchasing more than 700 tons from the Dadukou Ordnance Department of Chongqing in January of this year at a price of 940,000 yuan per ton for use by various industries, it has recently negotiated with the North China Iron and Steel Company to purchase a second batch of pig iron. It is reported that the negotiation has shown that, except for high-silicon iron, which is out of stock, there is an inventory of 4,000 tons of No. 1 pig iron, priced at 1,050,000 yuan per ton. There is also an inventory of 8,000 tons of No. 2 pig iron, priced at 980,000 yuan per ton. The above prices are for delivery at the Qinhuangdao or Tanggu wharf. For orders of 100 tons or more, 50,000 yuan per ton can be reduced. A deposit of 70% must be paid first, and the remainder must be paid upon shipment. For small orders, delivery will be made at the wharf within 15 days after receipt of the deposit, while large orders will require 30 days. Regarding freight, a flat rate of 300,000 yuan per ton will be charged, with refunds for overpayment and supplemental payments for underpayment, to be remitted by telegraph seven days before shipment. It is reported that the effective period of the transaction price is temporarily limited to ten days (i.e., maintained until March 15). Based on the terms of this transaction, the delivered price of this batch of pig iron to Shanghai is much lower than the current market price of pig iron in the city. It is reported that the transaction is currently in progress. In addition, the office negotiated the purchase of a batch of coke earlier this month, totaling approximately 160 tons, which has already been supplied to various mechanical and electrical industries at a price of 700,000 yuan per ton. It is reported that the market price of coke is approximately 1,800,000 to 2,000,000 yuan per ton.</p>

<h3>Prelude to the Moscow Conference: A Record of Matters Discussed by London Foreign Ministers' Representatives</h3>
<p>— Airmail report, March 1, Special correspondent in London, Fushong</p>
<p>The foreign ministers of the three countries are too busy, and their meetings are hurried with limited time. Therefore, before gathering in Moscow, they first send representatives to London to discuss matters, so that they can extract a clue from the myriad details as a basis for the three giants to meet and discuss. The meeting of representatives has been convened in London since January 14. It has been open for six weeks and ended on February 23, submitting the report to the foreign ministers. During the six weeks, they discussed German issues in the morning and Austrian issues in the afternoon. The United Kingdom had two representatives: Sir Hood, who attended discussions on issues related to Austria, and Sir William Strang, who attended discussions on issues related to Germany. The United States also had two: General Mark Clark, who was in charge of Austrian issues, and Mr. Robert Murphy, who was in charge of German issues. France only had one, M. Couve de Murville, and the Soviet Union only had one, Mr. Gusev, who attended both meetings.</p>
<p>Once the meeting opened, various small countries requested to participate one after another, and the written memorandums they sent in piled up like a mountain. The various dominions of the United Kingdom unanimously believed that the Paris Conference had already had disputes between large and small countries, and that a mistake should not be repeated. The eighteen countries that declared war on Germany this time should all have the opportunity to participate and speak. The Netherlands and Belgium, which suffered deeply from Germany's crimes, are now excluded, and are naturally indignant. Various parties have tried their best to request the right to speak.</p>
<p>China Sent a Memorandum</p>
<p>Our China did not send personnel to present reasons, but only sent a memorandum, reiterating what Minister Wang said in France, that China should also participate in convening the German peace conference. I remember that on the day the representatives' meeting was convened, British newspaper reporters inquired one after another whether China had a memorandum or whether it would send personnel to present its views. At that time, China did not make any moves. After the memorandum was sent, the newspapers did not mention a word about what China had proposed. During the representatives' meeting, there were also many opinions on whether to hold a large-scale peace treaty conference with Germany, like the Paris Peace Conference. Small countries believe that if small countries are allowed to participate and speak as much as possible during the preparation period, then the final conference will be brief and formal, which can save the lip service and propaganda speeches of the Justice and Peace Conference. The United Kingdom and the Soviet Union believe that whether the decisions of the foreign ministers' meeting are final or not, at least a peace conference should be convened to conclude the matter, while the United States is silent on this. If the Moscow Conference decides not to convene even a transferred peace conference, then our memorandum will completely lose its target.</p>
<p>Small Countries' Protests Take Effect</p>
<p>The protests and struggles of small countries have, after all, had considerable effect. When discussing the agenda of the German peace treaty, the French representative proposed three principles: First, the drafting of the peace treaty should naturally be the responsibility of the four countries. Second, the right of participation of other countries should be greater than the time when the Justice and other five small enemy countries were at peace. Third, while small countries participate, this should not increase the difficulties of the foreign ministers' meeting.</p>
<p>As for how to make the right of participation of small countries greater than the previous one, France also has suggestions: On the one hand, various small countries can send people to the foreign ministers' representatives' meeting to present their views, and on the other hand, a consultation and information committee should be organized, composed of representatives of the four major powers and "related countries," to provide consultation for the foreign ministers' meeting and also to contribute opinions to the foreign ministers' meeting. In the Potsdam Agreement, it was originally stipulated that when the foreign ministers' meeting discusses issues related to a certain country, that "directly related" country can be invited to participate. But how should the definition of "directly related" be made? The four foreign ministers' representatives had different views, and finally accepted the suggestion of the Soviet representative Gusev that any country that borders Germany or has been occupied by Germany is a "directly related" country. Although this definition is far-fetched, no definition is better than this, so it has to be passed. The Times said that in this way, Albania will be able to attend the discussion, while Canada, which has made outstanding contributions in the war against Germany, will have no share. From our Chinese point of view, since we have not been occupied by Germany and are far away in the Far East and do not border Germany, we will have no share in this committee. The United Kingdom and the United States support the participation of ten countries. So far, this is still pending, and will probably be submitted to the three giants for decision. But in any case, the four representatives unanimously acknowledge the error in drafting the Justice Peace Treaty, so they unanimously advocated that the countries concerned should be able to issue written statements as much as possible, and that when discussing issues related to that country and Germany, that country should be invited to attend. For example, in the case of German-Dutch issues, the Netherlands should be invited to express its views.</p>
<p>Two Unresolved Difficulties</p>
<p>The extent to which small countries should participate is the first issue on which the four representatives disagreed and could not decide. The second issue is the issue of Germany's national system. Belgium, the Netherlands, Greece, Brazil, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, and Luxembourg advocate that Germany should be a federal or confederate system in the future, while Yugoslavia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Belarus, Ukraine, and Norway advocate maintaining Germany's political unity. Those who advocate a federal system believe that only by dispersing its centralized power can Germany's aggressive power be weakened, while those who advocate political unity believe that dispersing it will stimulate its Greater Germanism and fuel its aggressive desires. It is better to unify it, which is easier to control. Although the two statements are extreme, their purpose is to prevent Germany from aggression in the future. The two opinions have also been submitted to the foreign ministers' meeting.</p>
<p>The German issue is just these two main branches, roughly speaking. As for Austria, the most troublesome thing is the issue of Yugoslavia wanting a piece of land in southern Austria. Since Yugoslavia's request for port affairs from Italy failed, this time it seems to be desperate, and it has the appearance of not stopping until it achieves its goal. It must have a piece of land in southern Austria called Carinhia (where most of the residents are Slovenes, 120,000 to 130,000). There are only 60,000 Germans. From the perspective of race and strategy, this piece of land should belong to Yugoslavia. The representative of the South, Dr. Vilfar, spoke eloquently, but the British representative said that a referendum was held there in 1920 under international supervision. 51% were returned to Austria, and 49% wished to belong to the South. The road was only given to Austria. The Prime Minister of Austria, Figl, rushed to London with his Foreign Minister and refused to give up this land of 1,000 square miles. He said to the South that his mistreatment of Slovenes was a false accusation. The case also went to Moscow.</p>
<p>Also, in the Potsdam Agreement, the Western countries promised to hand over the German assets in East Austria to the Soviet Union. Although the principle has been set, this time a detailed rule must be set. Western countries believe that this definition should be strict, so that many Austrian interests will not be confused with the German ones. The Soviet Union in the East believes that the more ambiguous the definition is, the better, so that it can enjoy the greatest benefits. This is another point of contention.</p>
<p>The above are just the general trends. There are also thousands and hundreds of requests for land cession, and tens of millions and hundreds of millions of requests for compensation, which are all pushed to Moscow for resolution. The current problems are much more complicated and thorny than in the Potsdam era. As the British Economist magazine rightly said: "What needs to be resolved now is not only the mistakes planted by Hitler, but also the problems committed by the victorious countries themselves."</p>
<h3>Dutch Youth Participate in Grand Celebration Parade</h3>
<p>— (Special correspondent for this newspaper, Wang Yizhiqi)</p>
<p>Celebration of the Fourth Dutch Queen's Grandchild</p>
<p>Leiden City Airmail Report, February 28, Special correspondent for this newspaper, Wang Yizhi</p>
<p>The Dutch royal family surnamed Oranji has been passed down for hundreds of years. They have accumulated virtue and benevolence and are deeply loved by the people. Now, they are known for their kindness and compassion among the various countries. Her Majesty Wilhelmina, the benevolent Empress of the Netherlands, has inherited the legacy of the late Empress Dowager. She is knowledgeable, advocates politics, and is close to the people. She participates in all kinds of events and knows everything in this complex life, prosperous career, and five-flowered, thousand-odd, wonderful new era and new world. She is able to adapt to the trend and win the sympathy of the social groups. Dr. L. J. M. Beel, the Dutch Prime Minister who formed a detached cabinet by integrating various parties last year, is also a virtuous minister of peace who has reversed the chaos and brought about good fortune. Although the national strength of the Netherlands has inevitably gone from rich to poor after the war, the love between the monarch and the people and the harmony between the upper and lower classes can be seen in the celebration of the birth of the fourth Queen's grandchild, Marijke (see the first picture) on the morning of February 19.</p>
<p>The fourth Queen's grandchild was born at 2:46 a.m. At that time, the people of the eleven provinces were all asleep. The Dutch official first used the radio to broadcast the good news. Hertogenbosch, the capital of Noord-Braban, the southern and northern wilderness province of the Netherlands, which believes in Roman Catholicism, has a carnival that usually celebrates the night. The college students who enjoy themselves in their dances by chance take the knowledge they have obtained first and return north at dawn. They arrive at the ancient ferry V-treclit in the center of the entire territory of the Netherlands and break the door of the great cathedral, swarming straight in, climbing the bell tower, and ringing the bell to spread the news to the entire city, quickly shattering the morning dreams of the residents everywhere. From near to far, it gradually reached everyone in the country. According to the traditional historical customs of the Netherlands, whenever there is a major event in the royal family, a Herald light cavalry is always used to fly and report to the people. On this day, all the cities, large and small, took a holiday for a full day of celebration. Men and women, young and old, left their alleys and came out. We still see the former light cavalry, as the vanguard of the opening road, wearing a grand crown and a magnificent momentum.</p>
<p>A Frenzied Procession Participates in the Grand Ceremony</p>
<p>Looking at this day, most of them are Hantang, The Hague, as well as Rotterdam ancient ferry Zhulin New Field Nijmegen Guangchuan Breda Zhongbao Middelburg Luling Groningen Shiwei Leeuwarden Yuwu Eind-hoven Xihan Hilversum Township Arn-hem Hejin Amers-foort Sifu Zwolle Leiden, and other cities, the same large and small celebrations of enthusiasm, enough to mark the following nine points, (1) Cars celebrating the royal family's great joy raced, departing from the east, west, north and south sides of the cities, one after another, all with the birthplace of the Queen's Grandchild, Nanxidi Soe-st-dijk, as their final concentrated destination, I should slightly change the ancient people's poems, and use the fourteen words "Nine Qu Kuanglang Open Palace, Wanxing Huan Yu Bai Mianliu" to describe its magnificence. (2) A flag-waving parade under a clear wind and beautiful sun. (3) A torch parade on a horse-drawn carriage and water-drawn vehicle. (4) A youthful and lively drum and music parade (see second picture). (5) Flag-raising speeches and music playing in the central city square. (6) Street corner dances in front of lanterns. (7) Children's games and entertainment in grand mansions and deep halls. (8) A large court chorus of tens of groups and tens of thousands of people, culminating in the Tap-toe music of the soldiers returning to camp at the urging of the time and urging of various pubs, to help the grand ceremony. (9) The blessing of the church. At the same time, the artistic talents of the whole country, each because of the good use of the commercial and industrial sectors' wide range of advertising strategies, showed their good skills, made money in a proper way, and used it at the right time. There are many ways for my domestic compatriots to rise up and imitate. There are many ways to take advantage of it. I will specifically cite seven things to illustrate the rest: First, the walls of royal government offices, major newspapers, and department stores, or pay tribute to orange electric bubbles, where the words and circles of the celebration are created, or install the latest Neon (that is, electric rainbow) electric light tubes, and the light scenes of happy symbols such as wading birds carrying infants emerge. Second, the windows of various shops are decorated with painted scenes and pictures, such as the Stork, which is used in Western customs to replace the unicorn who sends children, carrying the child in swaddling clothes, or spreading its wings and soaring, or living in a nest on the roof and standing high on the calendar, or placed next to an orange tree symbolizing the royal family, or embellishing the map of the Netherlands with the oblique continuous provinces, with colorful algae paintings, clever ideas, or tying orange and yellow silk ribbons, or placing orange thin silk curtains at the bottom of a small cradle that can be pushed by wheels, or arranging in a fan shape, interspersed with flags of various colors, or inserting a panorama of Nanxidi Palace, or encircling the reflections and portraits of the Dutch empress, queen, empress, and empress's grandchildren. Strolling through the streets, it is like visiting an exhibition of decorative arts and crafts. Third, in the ten days after the birth of the Queen's grandchild, the timely and wonderful products of the candy store are double-baked biscuits with mint-filled sugar dorps, slightly like the red-dyed happy eggs in China to celebrate the addition of a child. In Dutch customs, if a son is born to a family, undyed white grains are added to the cake surface, and red sugar grains are used for a daughter. Since orange and yellow are the surnames of the Dutch empress, the cake surface is covered with orange-yellow grains regardless of whether the royal family has a son or a daughter. Friends give each other gifts to celebrate the great joy. Fourth, the display of goods in various stores to cater to the psychology of ordinary people, such as vegetables and fruits that belong to orange, chrysanthemums with orange-yellow in flower shops, and orange-yellow candles in silverware stores, are examples. Fifth, the enthusiastic promotion of precious books about the royal family and postcards that promote the spirit of patriotism in color paintings in painting paper stores. Sixth, the fast meal or general meeting, the ingenuity of the dishes, and the production of a celebratory menu. The seventh item is the celebratory special issue of each daily newspaper. The cover always sees the orange-yellow color printed lace, or a special page in the newspaper is opened, specially revealing the poem of the painting for green decoration, which is slightly similar to the "Huanlong Dingye" of the previous generation of imperial books for the emperor's special respect, such as the organ newspaper for Roman Catholicism, The Maasbode's poem, the top center of the outer frame is painted with a royal crown, the left and right are decorated with orange and yellow, and the horizontal lintel is written with the words "Happy sound spreads all over the country", the left and right corners are listed the family crests of the Dutch royal family and the empress's husband, respectively, and there is a messenger pigeon flying downwards next to them, according to legend, in ancient times, the Old World was plagued by floods, Noah and his family moved into a lone boat in advance and floated in the sea, avoiding the disaster, waiting for the shore to be flooded and then the water receded, Noah first released a dove to try to fly to the mainland, but it was never seen returning, then he released a dove again, and after a long time, it returned with a green branch, which was the first good news that the flood had receded on the shore, so Westerners drew messenger pigeon paintings, and our Chinese red letter happy posts could be printed with golden pigeons to renew the public's vision and hearing, the left side of the outer frame is painted with a tall chimney, representing industry, painted with pleasure ship sailboats, and seagulls in the sky, representing shipping and commerce, the right side is painted with a church, and between the city residence and the rural house, there are courtyard trees, representing the foundation of the country, and on the lower side, the right is the farmer who uses horses to cultivate the land, the left is the sailor who ventures far away, and in the middle is written the children and women who carry their hands and sing after hearing the news, the poem title is the happy bell, the Western words are lengthy, evolved into seven sections, I will now extract its essence and translate it into a seven-character quatrain as follows:</p>
<p>Loving the Country and Respecting the King are Twins</p>
<p>"The good atmosphere shines back to the fourth spring, the orange fruit shows its spirit, people from the east, west, north, and south compete to congratulate, loving the country and respecting the king are twins."</p>
<p>There is a saying in China that a scholar's kindness is half a piece of paper. Western writing is lyrical, but it cannot be as wonderful as my square characters that combine characters and paintings. Therefore, Chinese painting has not progressed. Pictures in the West have long been in an important position, standing on their own. The decorative skills of Western society's art are more advanced than those of the Chinese. Every time there is a celebration, it can be because the pictures are exquisite, amazing and dazzling, and the innovations are wonderful. The material consumption is not much, but the spiritual benefits are very great. Nowadays, Chinese society is full of unpleasant and unhappy atmosphere. It is worried that it is too bitter and too dull. If we borrow the leisure of sound education and drum music, the comfort of Chen Sai's parade, the end of the dispute over rights within the door, and the reward of the innocence outside the object, reconcile the interest and unite the mood, how can there be no one to eliminate the last gaps and sit down to achieve peace?</p>

<h3>筧橋空軍官校　在苦難中創造前途</h3>
<p>— Hangzhou, 6th day of month. Special correspondent of this newspaper, Chu Yusheng.</p>
<p>In this era when the nation has once again fallen into the abyss of hardship, and all undertakings such as education and economy are in dire straits, only those with ambition and perseverance can maintain and create their careers. The Jianqiao Air Force Officer School, as the foundation of the air force construction, which is an important part of national defense construction, is the only supreme institution for training aviation talents. It is also creating its future amidst hardships.</p>
<p>Before the war, the air school had quite complete facilities and many houses. During the war, it was hated by the Japanese enemy and wantonly destroyed. It was not easy to repair after the war. Now, their student dormitory can only accommodate the 25th and 26th classes. The 27th class will arrive at the school in May, and there is a problem with the dormitory, which is being rebuilt. Originally, there were special classrooms for communication, bombing, expulsion, navigation, etc. in the education process, with very complete large-scale instruments inside. After the war, they were completely destroyed by the enemy. Now, they can only practice on machinery and conduct practical education. Originally, the air school was quite privileged, so almost every room had heating equipment. Now, only the office building has heating equipment, and there is none in other places.</p>
<p>Spring Chill, Starting a River</p>
<p>This reporter went to the air school for the sixth time. It was the time of early spring, but their heating pipes were not turned on. The Director of Education and several other officers smiled and said to the reporter, "The country is so difficult, how can we bear to waste public funds?" Under the call of Director Hu, all officers, students, and soldiers participated in labor service. As a result, they transformed dozens of acres of weedy and thorny wasteland into flat and usable land. Many roads in the school were built by officers and students, many trees were planted by officers and students, and many ditches were dug by officers, students, and soldiers. Lieutenant Colonel Zhu Shoushu pointed out to the reporter that this strong team is now starting to dig a river. "Hands are omnipotent," they are adhering to this motto!</p>
<p>26th Class Students, Learning Blind Flight</p>
<p>Their 26th class of students is learning the course of blind flight. Everyone happily boarded the plane and bravely soared in the sky. Especially those skilled instructors with past combat exploits, aviation is like drinking a glass of sweet wine to them. One instructor told me, "If I don't fly for a day, it's really uncomfortable." They have taken the vast sky as their paradise, and they can roam freely in the vast open space. It is said that the 26th class of students is undergoing the elimination process. Many students are very happy, but also very nervous. They are deeply afraid of being eliminated, deeply afraid of losing this vast aerial paradise, so they are all learning cautiously, hoping to become an important member of the air force construction. These days, the sound of light Stearman training planes has been constant in the sky over Hangzhou all day long. This is when the 26th class of students is learning blind flight.</p>
<p>In the History of Aviation, See Who Is Suitable for Aviation</p>
<p>I once pulled a few officers to discuss what kind of people are suitable for flying. In the history of world aviation, people who should have flying energy can be divided into three periods: the first period was before the First World War, when airplanes were just being invented, and everyone thought flying was a terrifying thing. Whether they could land safely after flying into the sky was a great doubt, so as long as they were brave, regardless of whether their body was good or not, they were all good at flying airplanes. By the First World War, people became interested in aviation, and discovered that in addition to having the conditions of courage, they also needed to have a healthy body. After the First World War, in addition to having courage and a strong body, they also needed a kind of aviation psychology. Aviation psychology is related to nationality, history, geography, habits, and other conditions. People in some places are suitable for aviation, while people in some places are not. For example, Guangdong is close to the ocean and is influenced by Mr. Sun Yat-sen and others, so they have a sound aviation psychology, so many people are suitable for aviation. Now, the United States determines whether a person is suitable for aviation. The highest authority belongs to aviation psychologists, followed by aviation doctors. In China, the highest authority for determining whether a person is suitable for aviation belongs to aviation doctors. Aviation psychologists are really rare, so we are one step behind others.</p>
<p>What Is the Main Cause of Airplane Accidents?</p>
<p>We also talked about the causes of the recent airplane accidents in Shanghai and Chongqing. The superficial reasons are abnormal weather, sloppy aircraft maintenance, negligent pre-flight checks, and excessive loading, but the main reason should be the unsound aviation psychology. Perhaps the driver had something to do the night before, or perhaps the driver encountered new stimuli, or perhaps the driver had fantasies about certain issues. Therefore, he could not devote his energy to driving, and he would encounter an unprecedented tragedy. According to one instructor, "During the war, even if the weather was abnormal, we had to fly to the front line to fight. Even if there were minor problems with the aircraft, we had to find a way to fly back to the original defense. At that time, all our energy was concentrated in one place, so we managed not to disgrace our mission. For example, Mr. Cao Chaojue, who flew over the Hump in a Stearman training plane, judging from the constant airplane accidents in Shanghai and Chongqing now, isn't it a myth that Mr. Cao was able to fly over the Hump?" We understood their enlightenment. Today, China is promoting aviation sports and exercising a sound physique, which is indeed a necessary path, but cultivating an aviation psychology is also very urgently needed.</p>
<p>In the Exhibition, Confident That the Future Is Promising</p>
<p>The officers and students of the Air Force Officer School hope that reporters will report the situation of the air school to everyone so that everyone can understand them. At the same time, they hope that more knowledge will enrich them and give them a richer education. At their request, this newspaper specially exhibited current affairs photos in their club. All the officers, students, and soldiers of the school, as well as all their families, came to visit. Later, Director Hu (Weike) said in a letter to this newspaper on the 3rd of this month, "From the exhibition of Shen Bao, I recognized China struggling in hardship," which made the reporter and all the colleagues of this newspaper excited and ashamed! Another enthusiastic and exciting scene is unforgettable. We saw their pure, innocent, and lively state, which made us confident that China has a future. According to the person in charge, the Chinese Kuomintang Party Department has left the school in 1945. Now they want to change the Political Department and establish a Guidance Office to complete the school system. All of this proves that the Air Force Officer School is creating its future in an era of hardship!</p>

<p>Starting from the Passing of a Friend</p>
<p>Yesterday, I went to a guild hall to mourn the loss of a deceased friend. I found the scene too desolate. The four walls had no elegiac couplets, and there were few people mourning. The flickering candles and the crying of the family shrouded the desolate mourning hall. Seeing this scene, I couldn't help but shed a few tears of sympathy.</p>
<p>Speaking of this deceased friend, he was still young and at the prime of his life. He served in an organization. He was loyal to his duties and was also a very "law-abiding" person. He never neglected his duties, even without strict review from the public sector. So he can be said to be a model good civil servant.</p>
<p>He had an elderly mother and young siblings at home, all of whom depended on him for their livelihood. The burden on his shoulders was really too heavy. But his income was meager beyond belief, so he had to try his best to save money and provide for his mother and two siblings as much as possible.</p>
<p>His work was too troublesome and his nutrition was too poor, so his body suffered damage without him realizing it. Over time, inflammation developed. When he went to the hospital, he still thought about his duties even while sick, but the illness gradually became serious, and finally his life was taken away by the ruthless god of death!</p>
<p>It is said that his illness was not absolutely incurable, but because of the lack of medical expenses, the hospital was unwilling to provide careful treatment. And after this friend died in the hospital, he still owed a large sum of medical expenses. Therefore, the hospital absolutely did not allow his family to move the body out of the morgue until this large sum was paid. According to his family's situation, it was of course impossible to bear such a large sum of medical expenses. Although the public sector has stipulated bereavement pay, it is too small, so this expense, along with the funeral expenses, was still raised by others through fundraising. The misery of a civil servant's life, how can it not make people grieve and lament!</p>
<p>The dead are gone. I imagine that there are many other civil servant comrades in the same situation as this friend. Therefore, I cannot help but make a painful appeal for this group of civil servant comrades. I think civil servants are people who work for the country. If the country cannot provide a definite guarantee for the lives of these civil servants, not only will this deceased friend forever hold regret under the springs, but how can the many surviving civil servant comrades be able to cheer up their enthusiasm for work? This will undoubtedly have an impact on the future of the country. I hope that the authorities can learn from the facts described in this article and make practical improvements to the lives of a group of civil servants in the long term. That would be very fortunate.</p>
<p>The Garbage on Changshou Road Has Been Cleared</p>
<p>This column published an article based on a reader's request for cleanliness on Changshou Road. Now, we have received a letter from the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau stating: "We ordered the Cleaning Brigade to investigate. According to the reply, the garbage at that location was difficult to clear because the ships at the garbage wharf were stranded and the transportation was abnormal. In order to thoroughly clear it, the garbage was concentrated at the above location, and trucks were reassigned to transport it. It has been verified that the garbage on Changshou Road was completely cleared on February 4th." We are publishing this information specially.</p>
<h3>Continued Discussion on Public Utilities in Suzhou</h3>
<p>— Suzhou, 6th day of month. Special correspondent of this newspaper, Wu Shouren</p>
<p>Technical Difficulties, Widespread Public Telephones</p>
<p>Taking a closer look at today's Suzhou Telecommunications Bureau, although the service efficiency of its employees and internal management can be said to be impeccable, there is a technical difficulty that is seriously hindering the growth of the Suzhou telecommunications industry. In short, it is the obsolescence of the machinery: most of the existing switching exchanges and some telephones are old items from before the war. In particular, the exchange equipment has been in operation for more than 20 years, exceeding its load-bearing age. Therefore, when telephones malfunction, it is impossible to repair them all. Both users and technicians feel pain. The Telecommunications Bureau has made its best efforts to remedy this. They have strictly implemented the morning telephone testing and night line testing system, so that the Bureau can know about telephone malfunctions from the testing before the user has even discovered them, and immediately send technicians to repair them. The second is that the city telephone restriction measures promulgated by the Ministry of Communications continue to be effective, so that new users in the area who need telephones, although they are eager to have them installed, cannot have their wishes fulfilled. In order to make up for this shortcoming, Director Chen has opened up many public telephones, which are installed separately in densely populated and commercially built areas to facilitate many people.</p>
<p>Electricity and Steam Business, Limited to Lighting</p>
<p>The general situation of the telecommunications business in Suzhou has been briefly described above. Next is the electricity and steam business. The so-called electricity and steam business is currently limited to lighting. The Suzhou Electric Light Plant is a purely commercial institution, and its scale is one of the best on the Beijing-Shanghai line. Its power generation is 70,000 degrees of electricity, and the source of light for the entire county depends entirely on it. However, due to the difficult source of coal, the entire city stops supplying daytime electricity for two days a month, on the 1st and 15th of each month. On other days, power outages are rotated by region. This is a blow to many manufacturing plants that do not have their own power generation capabilities. All parties hope to improve, but limited to the actual difficulties of the electric light plant, being able to勉力to do what it is doing now is already quite commendable. The reporter interviewed their person in charge, who said that although the price of each degree of electricity is on average as high as 750 yuan, they still suffer extremely tragic losses every month. The crux of the matter is that the amount of allocated coal is too small, only about 2,500 tons a month, while the actual consumption reaches more than 4,000 tons. The difference of more than 1,500 tons must be completely sought from the market, with a price of 900,000 yuan per ton. The biggest reason for the loss is this. However, having said that, when it comes to the treatment of colleagues, in the current society of Suzhou, employees of the Electric Light Plant have a relatively secure life. Regarding this point, it is ultimately a fairly acceptable achievement.</p>
<p>Public Buses, Shortcomings Need to Be Remedied</p>
<p>What needs to be reported again is the urban public bus service, which opened in July last year. At that time, it caused fierce debates in all circles of Suzhou. Some believed that this was an evolution of social transportation and should be supported. Some believed that the current society was too poor, and the operation of public buses would seriously threaten the livelihoods of rickshaw pullers, leading to social unrest, and that it should be delayed. But in the end, public buses appeared before the people of Suzhou in the midst of everyone's desire for evolution. However, later, the failure to publicly solicit bids caused fierce criticism. However, after not much time, it disappeared. Until two months ago, the accumulation of unpaid road maintenance fees of more than 100 million yuan affected the Suzhou streets, which were gradually deteriorating due to the heavy load, but the problem of being unable to start construction made local public opinion greatly dissatisfied. But as of now, it has still subsided without any conclusion. From the reporter's objective standpoint, the operation of public buses is indeed an indisputable business under the current social transportation needs. However, Suzhou public buses also have their undeniable shortcomings: First, the bus bodies are converted from ten-wheeled military trucks, and the equipment is too rudimentary, but the fare is not cheap at all. Second, the drivers' driving skills and service ethics are too bad. In just six months of operation, several innocent people have been sacrificed under the huge wheels. Tragedies of being crushed and injured are common. The company often only uses economic compensation as a way to deal with it.</p>
<p>To sum up, the public utilities in Suzhou are too fragile, so fragile that it is hard for outsiders to believe. Among them, only the telecommunications business is quite commendable in terms of management. However, because of this, we feel that the telecommunications business in Suzhou should devote its efforts to cultivating it, so that good management can be matched with good technology, and bring a different brilliance to the entire public utility business in Suzhou! At the same time, it is hoped that the city telephone restriction measures can be abolished as soon as possible, so that the telecommunications business can fully achieve the ultimate goal of serving mankind. Speaking from the heart, Suzhou is a city worth developing. On the Beijing-Shanghai line, apart from Shanghai, how many wealthy places can have more than one million residents (including towns)? Are we willing to let it continue to lag behind in this way?</p>

<h3>Writing Before the Ying Yepin Painting Exhibition Whether Chinese Painting Will Last Forever</h3>
<p>— Ding Shan</p>
<p>Yepin is about to open a painting exhibition and asked me to write a preface. I said, I'm really tired of writing the same old things. Let's talk about the intrinsic value of Chinese painting. Yepin said okay, so we set the above topic.</p>
<p>The highest art in China is poetry, calligraphy, and painting, but recently I often feel a kind of terrifying threat, feeling that the "highest art" not only has no hope of revival, but is also about to face destruction. First, is there a need for "poetry," this five-character and seven-character rhyming poetry, in the environment of a real society? It is even resented by ordinary people, who say that it has no room for free expression, but is only left to a few old gentlemen who cling to the old and guard the dead to groan. This system, from poetry, lyrics, and music, to the three-five-seven-character "Kunqu Opera" and "Peking Opera," is heading into the shadows of decline. The more it moves away from the public, the darker it becomes!</p>
<p>The second is calligraphy, that is, the beauty of Chinese characters. The beauty of Chinese characters is unique to China. Although Japan has the same characters as us, it cannot get the beauty of our Chinese characters. Although the need for these characters cannot be abandoned in the use of Chinese characters, the aesthetic conditions of the calligraphy have been completely destroyed. Not to mention that no one is willing to put in the effort to pay attention to calligraphy itself, even the tool for writing characters, the "brush," is gradually being occupied by fountain pens, pencils, and even ballpoint pens, and has lost the conditions for calligraphy itself. This terrifying threat has spread throughout the country. I am afraid that in less than ten years, not only will no one be able to write Chinese characters, but no one will even recognize them.</p>
<p>In the past twenty years, what has been struggling and preserved a little is still "Chinese painting." Painting is a combination of poetic ideas, expressed with the brush used for writing. It does not have the difficulty of "poetry" or the monotony of "calligraphy." Ordinary people can still accept it. They can see a mountain and a tree from a certain ink splatter, and a flower or a bird from a certain color block, so they are more able to appreciate it and even willing to spend money to buy it and hang it on their walls to flaunt their elegance. Therefore, those who hold the brush to paint are more numerous than those who hold the brush to write poetry or write characters. It seems to be growing day by day in the 36th year of the Republic of China, and each representative writer of each period has a patriarch. In the early Republic of China, Wu Changshuo and Wang Yiting were popular, and the patriarchs they held up were Bada Shanren, Qing Teng, and Banqiao. In the mid-Republic of China, Zhang Daqian and others held up Shitao and Mei Qushan. The Western painters of Liu Haisu's generation turned to learning Chinese painting, felt that writing with a brush was unbearable restraint, and advocated "rebel art," not wanting a patriarch, but seeing his real-life paintings, he still could not escape Bada Shitao. After the 20th year of the Republic of China, Wu Dayu and Wang Yiting passed away, Zhang Daqian moved to the Dunhuang Grottoes to paint Buddhist images, and there was no main force to promote and shout for the patriarch. People were also tired of the strange Bada school and the red and green Shitao school, and gradually returned to the Four Wangs and Wu Li. Until now, Liu Haisu has also changed to painting Shigutu. The standard for buying paintings is to specifically ask Feng Chaoran, Wu Xiangfan, Wu Daiqiu and other collectors for inspections. Therefore, they unintentionally unanimously promoted Dong Yuan and Ju Ran, and the Four Wangs, not to mention Wen Zhengming, Shen Zhou, Tang Yin, and Qiu Ying, seemed to be unworthy.</p>
<p>Exhibitions are crowded with people, and it is not surprising that each exhibition earns a lot of money. Every painter is thriving, thinking that they are better than the Yuan Dynasty and surpass the Song Dynasty, and even have the idea that Dong Yuan, Ju Ran, Guan Tong, and Jing Hao are nothing more than that. Who knew that since the victory, in less than two years, the golden age of painters had suddenly disappeared. Those who were once praised for their paintings in Luoyang are now all desolate. Therefore, everyone unanimously blamed the collapse of the economy, which led to the weakening of the purchasing power of art appreciators. Painters have lost their livelihood and can no longer produce exquisite works. The decline of painting has also followed the same demise as "poetry" and "calligraphy," and has truly become "three absolutes"?</p>
<p>In fact, Chinese painting had already died, not in the 36th year of the Republic of China, but in the early Qing Dynasty. If we carefully examine it, we can know that the source of life for art itself is always new. Just like poetry changes to lyrics, lyrics change to music, seal script changes to clerical script, clerical script changes to regular script, and regular script changes to cursive script, all are moving forward. Painting changed from the figures and animals of the Jin and Tang Dynasties to the landscapes of the Song Dynasty, and from the reality of the Song Dynasty to the abstraction of the Yuan and Ming Dynasties. It has been changing to Dong Qichang and Wang Yuanqi, who are completely drawing sketches in their paintings. It is always moving forward. After the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, they specialized in creating retro styles, imitating everything. Therefore, "poetry" stopped at "Jiangxi" and "Xikun," "calligraphy" stopped at "Zhao" and "Dong," and "painting" stopped at the "Four Wangs." Until the Republic of China, "poetry" could not buy money, and people did not want to study it, so it died first. Apart from a few Hanlin scholars, calligraphy could not buy money, so it also continued to decline. Painting still had a group of ordinary people to buy it, but they also had an attitude of being tired of the old and liking the new to choose their own preferences. Therefore, painters had to struggle to keep up with the times and cater to their preferences, so they changed again and again in the thirty-sixth year, and in the end could not escape the small scope of the ancients, and showed a scene where the modern atmosphere was exhausted.</p>
<p>So, can this "painting," the quintessence of China, still exist? I firmly say it exists, it exists permanently! But what exists is the creation of the Republic of China era, not the resurrection of Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, Ju Ran, or even the Four Wangs and Wu Li. Just like "poetry," a new creation will appear in the future, which cannot be encompassed by the Jiangxi school or the Xikun style.</p>
<p>This small discussion ends here, and Yepin's painting exhibition finally opened on the fifth of this month on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Township Association. Whether his strength can add a bit of vitality to the permanent existence of "painting," we can go to find the soul in his paintings.</p>
<p>Ying Yepin I Know Zheng Wuchang</p>
<p>The success of a painter is not accidental; they must have considerable learning — a clear distinction between good and bad, thoughtful understanding, a receptive attitude, and skillful change. These are the four beauties of painting (my humble opinion, I hope those who know will not disagree). Those who can distinguish between good and bad have a direction for their studies and will not go astray. What is good? How to achieve the good? They must add contemplation and spontaneously produce wonderful understanding. Wonderful traces often appear, and wonderful methods appear from time to time, not limited to ancient or modern times, and only those with a receptive attitude can gain and accept them. If the eyes have it and the spirit understands it, but the hands cannot respond, it is like entering a real mountain and returning empty-handed, and nothing is gained. One must have the skills to change and transform in order to be able to master all the strengths and create their own universe as if coming to a new land.</p>
<p>I remember more than ten years ago, Yepin lived close to me, and we could spend time together in the morning and evening, talking freely about ancient and modern painting. His distinction between good and bad was very high. Whenever he saw famous works, his eyes were bright and he wanted to see through the paper, and then he would nod and applaud, praising them repeatedly. His intelligence was beyond that of ordinary people. Even if it was made by a market historian or a village child, he would still repeatedly examine it to find its good points, and often said: "Tao is in the rubble, there may be wonderful things in it that people cannot think of or do." His receptiveness is like mud. Whenever he had an understanding, he would diligently pursue it with his hands, striving to exhaust its mysteries before stopping. Because his talent and hard work are equipped with the four beauties, his works are new and different every day, and he goes in and out of the Song and Yuan dynasties. Figures, flowers, birds, fish, and insects are all exquisitely crafted, especially landscapes. He has gained more from the methods of Huang Gongwang and Wang Meng. Huang Gongwang's work combines grandeur with simplicity, and Wang Meng's work combines simplicity with grandeur. The innermost secrets of this, Yepin can magically understand in the solitary branches and rocks, towering peaks and deep ravines, all of which move people's hearts and minds. Is Yepin not a man of today! Recently, Yepin will exhibit his masterpieces on the fifth floor of the Ningbo Township Association, with a total of more than one hundred points. Those who know will often be happy to congratulate Yepin on his success.</p>
<h3>On Paintings</h3>

<p>On Inscribing on Master Daqian's Collection of Wu Xiaoxian's Calligraphy Scroll "Wu Ling Spring"</p>
<p>The spring hues of Wu Ling have fallen to the spring wind,</p>

<h3>Wu Zhi Lao's Calligraphy - Jiang Jinziyuan Temple Stele</h3>
<p>— Guan Zhou</p>
<p>The famous calligrapher Wang Juesi said: "The beginning of calligraphy is difficult to enter the model, and the end is difficult to exit the model." The world is full of writing, and everyone knows it, but only our country regards writing as an art equivalent to painting and sculpture.</p>
<p>Skilled in painting, exquisite in calligraphy, and proficient in poetry, these are known as the "three perfections." Mr. Wu Zhihui, who is advanced in years and highly virtuous, is capable of all three. Some say that Mr. Wu has never painted, but they have probably never seen his paintings. Recently, I saw on Mr. Wu's bookshelf a volume of his manuscripts that he is currently writing, which explains the six types of Chinese characters. In it, he lists about five hundred pictographic characters, each with a picture. For example, for "rain," he paints rain, and for "clouds," he paints clouds, and he even adds color. Therefore, Mr. Wu is also capable of painting.</p>
<p>Recently, the stele inscription of the Jiang Jinziyuan Temple, written by Mr. Wu, has been published and is being sold at 40 Lu Ban Road. The inscription was written by Quan Zuwang of Yin in the year Wuwu of the Qianlong reign (1738), and Mr. Chen Bulei's postscript states, "...After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Wu Zhihui was asked to rewrite this stele, and his son Jingguo was instructed to select skilled stonemasons from Suzhou to carve it in stone, so that it would last forever. In the summer of the thirty-fifth year [of the Republic], the carving was completed. Mr. Wu's original calligraphy, without the slightest deviation, is vigorous, upright, and elegant, executed with the spirit of seal script and official script, enough to be admired for calligraphy for a thousand years. All his life, he favored regular script, which was used for the imperial examinations during the Ming and Qing dynasties, and was used as the standard for selection. Mr. Wu was a licentiate (juren) of the Qing dynasty and was also proficient in seal script. The beauty of his regular script, with its upright form and elegant strokes, needs no praise from me."</p>

<h3>Joint Catalogue of Three Artists' Exhibitions</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>Recently, within the past two weeks, three painters, Zhang Yanfu, Ying Yeping, and Zhu Qishi, have successively held individual exhibitions at the Chinese Painting Gallery and the Ningbo Native Place Association Gallery. At a time when economic issues of gold and American dollars and political issues of peace talks and reorganization are causing the world to spin, artists are still independently creating and holding exhibitions. This cannot but be considered a dose of coolness for the depressed masses of society. Especially for us art workers, this is of particular interest.</p>
<p>Zhu, Zhang, and Ying are all young and vigorous painters in their forties. They each have their own talents and skills and are all friends I admire. Yanfu's landscapes imitate Shitao and Shixi, Qishi writes about the Yellow Mountains, and Yeping takes inspiration from various schools and is not exclusively devoted to one. Therefore, in this exhibition, more than 70% of Yanfu's paintings are landscapes of the Second Stone (Shitao and Shixi). The layout, environment, and techniques such as trees, stones, and moss dots are all in the style of the Second Stone, especially in terms of artistic conception, which is simple, natural, and appropriately ingenious! What I admire most about him is that between the outlines of the mountains and rocks, the misty clouds and waters, he renders some light ochre and azurite, which is fluent and lively, and depicts the beauty of the mountains and rivers and the charm of Mount Taihua without omission. He does not care about being too similar to Shitao and Shixi!</p>
<p>In recent years, Yeping's landscapes have used the Four Wangs as his bridge. Passing through this bridge, he attacks Wen Zhengming, Shen Zhou, Huang Gongwang, and Wang Meng in one go, and he has actually been able to enter their halls. This cannot but make us admire him. In this exhibition, the magnificence of "Luofu Mountain Qiaogang," the steadiness of "Holding a Staff and Watching the Waterfall," the secluded elegance of "Chaoshan Xiaxia," and the upright elegance of "Orchids and Bamboo" are indeed derived from the style of Wu Zhonggui and Zhao Wenmin.</p>
<p>Since the Ming and Qing dynasties, many painters have written about the Yellow Mountains. The Yellow Mountains have three wonders: strange pines, bizarre rocks, and chaotic clouds, all of which are excellent models. Mei Qing, whose art name was Mei Shanshan, was famous for painting the Yellow Mountains, but Mei Qing's brushwork was plain, and his spirit was always insufficient. In recent times, Zhang Daqian has been able to capture the charm of the Yellow Mountains' three wonders, earning him the praise of the art world. In addition to Daqian, Qishi also likes to write about the Yellow Mountains and has a similar yet different approach to Daqian. Qishi is also skilled in calligraphy, painting, and seal carving. His calligraphy starts with the Second Emperors (Li Yu and Zhao Ji), incorporating the brushstrokes of Ouyang Xun, Yu Shinan, Huang Tingjian, and Liu Gongquan, which are elegant and unrestrained and are also similar to Huang Tingjian. His seal carving takes from ancient seals, stele inscriptions, Qin imperial edicts, and bronze inscriptions, so his ancient carvings are solid and can be well matched with his calligraphy. Mr. Xiao Wuwuquan once commented on Wu Changshuo: "His painting is not as good as his calligraphy, and his calligraphy is not as good as his seal carving," but Qishi does not have that shortcoming.</p>
<h3>Chinese Painting in Europe and America – A Record of Zhang Yunggu's Speech</h3>
<p>— Chen Lin</p>
<p>The Sino-British Cultural Association recently held an art evening at the Nanjing Clubhouse, attended by more than a hundred people from England, America, Holland, Canada, and other countries living in Nanjing. Professor Zhang Yunggu was specially invited to give a speech. Dr. Fitzgerald, the chairman, gave a speech introducing Zhang, saying that Zhang devoted himself to painting in his spare time, held exhibitions in North America in previous years, and lectured at New York University and other schools. Zhang's speech cited British poetry and prose to explain Chinese painting, and his language was very humorous. The following is a translation of a few points based on my recollection.</p>
<p>A rich man in Chicago, Mr. Gu, purchased a masterpiece of Chinese painting and praised its mystery and the brightness of its colors, showing it to everyone. Unexpectedly, the so-called masterpiece was actually an "ancestral portrait" used by ordinary families for ancestor worship. (According to exporters, before the war, a large number of ancestral portraits from our country were exported and sold to various cities in the United States.) Although the painting has its significance in terms of patterns and customs, it is ridiculous to represent Chinese painting with it and exaggerate it.</p>
<p>In fact, major art museums in Europe and America also have many exquisite Chinese paintings, such as the Admonitions Scroll by Gu Kaizhi's daughter in the British Museum and the court paintings of the Song Dynasty in the Boston Museum, which are extremely valuable. I once saw a long handscroll of autumn insects painted in color by Qian Xuan of the Yuan Dynasty in the Detroit Museum, which was truly a masterpiece. Not only were the forms vivid and lifelike, but the colors were also able to capture the truth. Biologists in that country said that the colors of grasshoppers and frogs in autumn change due to the change of seasons. It is truly rare that Chinese painters six hundred years ago could express them with such precision.</p>
<p>In a New York painting exhibition, a merchant once selected a Chinese album of flowers and birds, but did not like the flying birds, and only selected a painting of a fat, silly goose. Someone asked why he abandoned the small birds and chose the big goose. He replied that since the cost was the same, the fat goose was more solid and full, while the small birds were too small and insignificant. Judging from his tone, this person may have been a cook. Chinese painting emphasizes the sense of emptiness and spirituality in its composition, but foreigners who are concerned with every detail do not know such leisurely elegance.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Territory, An Inch of Blood 193</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>In the room, Yaoqun clearly read out the good news they had received, word by word. Even Hucheng now fully understood what was going on. Everyone's thoughts immediately produced a violent reaction, and they were all using their brains to plan the most appropriate way to respond. No one spoke first, so the whole room was silent.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Hejian finally broke the silence, walking towards Mr. W's huge desk and apologizing to Mr. W, "I'll just borrow a phone here for a moment." Before Hejian finished speaking, Mr. W had already handed the phone over the desk.</p>
<p>"Hello...Is that the Ping Office?" Hejian spoke in Japanese, "Oh, please let Director Songjing speak...Me?...Hejian Yu of the General Staff Headquarters...What? Gone out? Then please let Director Jiu Speaking?...Oh? Gone out too?...Oh, going to Fengtai?...Meeting? Okay, please let the Duty Director of the Secretariat speak...Huh...Then please let Vice Adjutant Sato speak...Okay!"</p>
<p>Having said this, Hejian put the phone receiver in his arms, closed the mouthpiece, and smiled coldly at us, "They're playing tricks again...Maybe they really went to a meeting?"</p>
<p>Mr. W nodded, pointing at Hejian's arms, indicating that he should pay attention to the phone.</p>
<p>"Hello?...I wouldn't dare, Hejian Yu...Is that Sato-kun?...Yes...I have something to ask you about. According to the report from my subordinates, your department, or maybe other intelligence agencies, has sent teams to concentrate here. I don't know what their target is...Oh?...It has nothing to do with your department...Then who is it?...Nakajima or Kawashima?...Oh, Nakajima?...To protect us?...What a joke, I dare not bother them!"</p>
<p>Hejian put down the phone, "After all this trouble, it's still a problem among brothers?" Hejian smiled coldly, the color on his face had changed, and he really seemed a little angry; "Okay, I should stand up and go forward!" Saying that, he looked at me again, "Brother Yue, let's see if we're going to have bad luck, even the 'Manchurian bitch' has come looking for us...Let's go!" Hejian was acting like a child throwing a tantrum.</p>
<p>"Urgent..." The building alarm sounded again, Yaoqun quickly read, "According to Fuzhong's report, the building has been surrounded on all sides, and the exit has been cut off...The assault troops have reached the Second Branch of the West District. Report received, awaiting orders to act...There has been contact in the hall...Urgent...All items in this building have been prepared according to the order!"</p>
<p>"Probably someone has already come in..." Hejian was very annoyed; because this kind of nameless "protection" hurt his dignity, and of course there must be other purposes inside. "Let's go down?" Hejian looked at us.</p>
<h3>Realism in Western Art History "Impressionist" Artists</h3>
<p>— Shen Yan</p>
<p>The name "Impressionism" was a satirical name given by critics to the art exhibition of the "Nameless Society" held in 1874. This was because Monet's work "Impression, Sunrise" was exhibited at the exhibition, and the critics therefore called it "the exhibition of Impressionist artists." This name was later publicly recognized and became a term in art history. However, the content of Monet's "Impression, Sunrise" is actually more profound than the critics thought at the time, and in meaning, it represents Impressionism and symbolizes the life of Monet, the central figure of Impressionism. Monet's paintings are based on sunlight, air tones, and water surface as the main body of art. This kind of work depicting the morning mist shrouded in the water and the sun slowly rising really hints at the direction in which Monet's landscape paintings will develop.</p>
<p>For more than ten years before this exhibition, Monet had often gathered together with several like-minded writers. In 1863, he saw Edouard Manet's solo exhibition, which was quite inspiring, and paid special attention to Manet's "Luncheon on the Grass" and "Olympia." Manet's work, which caused a lot of controversy, was supported by young artists due to Baudelaire's defense, and this atmosphere finally developed into the exhibition of the "Nameless Society."</p>
<p>Manet was an artist who initially influenced Monet, but later was influenced by Monet. In terms of painting landscape systems, he stood in the position of the realist school that developed Courbet since the color standard. Although he joined the group of artists mentioned above and occupied a leading position for a period of time, he was by no means an Impressionist artist. He adopted the so-called "plein air" production attitude and did plein air sketches, which was after being influenced by Monet. However, Manet originally liked the brightness of external light and its rich colors, and hated the dim colors of Courbet. Although it belongs to the Courbet system, the use of color is the opposite. Therefore, it can be said that he is an artist between Courbet and Monet.</p>
<p>Manet's paintings, no matter in any corner of the picture, are full of bright colors; if the same painting method of expressing the brightness and darkness of light is used to supplement the lack of brilliance of the pigment itself, the shadow portion must be made particularly dark. Therefore, if you want to remove the dark color from the screen, you must also give the shadow a rich color. And use another technique in the expression of light. This tendency will inevitably lead to the "light description" of Impressionism.</p>
<p>"Impressionism" is not a school with a so-called "impressionism" painting theory. The artists belonging to this school all study according to their own artistic beliefs and their own techniques. Therefore, although the artists who are said to belong to this group have different painting styles or techniques. This point is very important for understanding the characteristics of Impressionism. It is also the main point to distinguish it from the so-called "Neo-Impressionism." As for the "Neo-Impressionism," there is no sound realism spirit, only an inferior imitation of "Impressionism."</p>
<h3>Two Matters in Japan</h3>
<p>— Laoyan</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Xu has just returned from Japan. I invited him to drink somewhere and asked him about the recent situation there. He immediately talked about the following two things, which increased my feelings!</p>
<p>Since Japan surrendered the year before last, its domestic politics and economy have been controlled by MacArthur. Therefore, the restriction on light and heavy industries is very strict. Only people from victorious countries can apply to start a business. The Japanese had no choice but to shamelessly seduce the great Chinese nationals residing in their country, saying that they could apply in their names, and if the matter was successful and profitable, they would share the profits. The Chinese compatriots profited from their wealth and did not hesitate to sell their national character, and they applied for them one after another. It is not difficult to imagine how much they earned each month. Although MacArthur knew the ills, he did not investigate, but he would never tolerate it for the American people.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu's left neighbor is a Japanese family. He often went to chat when he was bored. He saw that the low table was missing a leg, which made it inconvenient to place things. After half a month, he was still the same, so he asked strangely. He said: "The carpenter has no time!" Mr. Xu clearly saw a carpenter Zhang next door, who was wandering around doing nothing, so he recommended Zhang to him. The owner replied: "The one recommended by you is a citizen of your country. What I said was that our own craftsman has no time."</p>
<p>Comparing the above two things, I wonder what my compatriots who often abandon their own goods and love foreign goods will think after reading this!</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>"Pulling Dragon Firewood" - A Tale of Gold Mining in the Sea</h3>
<p>— Tiandiren</p>
<p>Garbage, which Shanghai people consider to be annoying waste, is greeted with ecstasy by people in the countryside, who regard it as valuable fuel; because in this era of "expensive firewood," many shops in towns have changed to burning rice husks and other sundries due to the high price of firewood. Therefore, dried garbage is regarded as cheap and high-quality fuel.</p>
<p>From Longhua in the south to Sizui Point, the villagers along the shore gather in groups, men, women, old and young, to the foreshore after the tide recedes to rake garbage - they call it "pulling dragon firewood." The tools they use, in addition to a bamboo-toothed rake, include grass baskets, burlap sacks, reed bags, etc., to hold the garbage. Each time, they return fully loaded.</p>
<p>Driven by curiosity, I went to the foreshore one day to observe in person. I saw groups of "gold diggers," including hunchbacked old men and old women over sixty years old, boys and girls around ten years old who were of school age, and young and strong young men and women. They traveled back and forth on the cold Huangpu Beach, nervously raking the wet garbage with bamboo-toothed rakes, and piling it into their grass baskets, burlap sacks, or reed bags, and then carrying it back to dry.</p>
<p>Looking closely at the drying garbage, I saw rice straw, chicken feathers, rubber bands for bundling banknotes, corks for thermos bottles, rotten vegetable roots and leaves, and tattered scraps of paper...In short, bamboo heads and wood scraps, everything was available. Children, seeing it, were as if they were in the Grand View Garden, prostrate and picking up their toys, which was quite interesting.</p>
<p>After the garbage is dried, it is carried to the town and sold to teahouses, tofu shops, etc. At first, it was sold for two or three thousand yuan per load, but now it has been increased to five or six thousand yuan per load, and there are also some users who buy it in the countryside; the villagers rake all day, from fifty or sixty pounds to more than two hundred pounds, and each person has an income of two or three thousand yuan to more than 20,000 yuan per day. It is a small supplement to this rural sideline. It is said that the stronger the north wind, the more it blows, but at the same time it is colder. They would rather be attacked by the cold wind than want the wind to be calm. This abnormal psychology is both pitiful and sighable!</p>
<p>This kind of dried garbage is only suitable for kitchens with bellows. When burned, the firepower is quite strong, but because there are impurities in it that cannot be used as fuel, it is impossible to carefully select and pick them out, so they have to be burned in a mess. Therefore, when burning, strange noises are mixed together, and the stench is difficult to smell, but once you get used to it, you will be indifferent and not surprised.</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council passed a resolution to allocate 450 million yuan to clear the accumulated garbage in the city. It is estimated that this accumulated garbage is no less than ten thousand tons. Where will so much garbage go? There are no garbage dumps and no garbage warehouses. Incinerate it? Not necessarily. The only way out is naturally to dump it into the sea, let it drift with the waves, and let it go. Fortunately, the "snow in front of the door" has been swept away, and he doesn't care about the "frost on the roof"! Once cleared out, I don't know how many tons will be destroyed by the villagers!</p>
<h3>Houseboats</h3>
<p>— Jiang Yin</p>
<p>To solve the housing shortage problem, there is now another method in the United States, which is newly built small boats that can be used as houses. They are thirty-six feet long, have a forty-five horsepower engine, and a speed of seven miles per hour.</p>
<p>It is fireproof and rustproof, and also has durable wool to insulate it.</p>
<p>The boat has a lounge, dining room, bathroom, and kitchen. The lounge can be divided into two bedrooms if necessary. The kitchen is very well arranged, with a refrigerator, four wall cabinets, a washing basin, a stove, and a table.</p>
<p>The installed current is 110 volts, and its value is 9,990 US dollars.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Incident</h3>
<p>— Liu Meng</p>
<p>I hope that the Taiwan incident can be resolved reasonably as soon as possible. Regardless of who is responsible for this incident, I hope that the civil and military officials who govern Taiwan can correct their past mistakes. I can't help but sincerely pray for this.</p>
<p>Because of this incident, I was reminded of the psychology of the Chinese people after the end of the Anti-Japanese War. I have never been to the rear, but I do not regret it. I have been doing things worthy of the country in the occupied land. Victory came, and like everyone in the occupied areas, I breathed a sigh of relief, with joy, extended a helping hand, and waited for a familiar handshake. But I was disappointed. We were discriminated against. The occupied area was like a happy land with terrible germs, and the people in the occupied area seemed to have been enjoying themselves during the Anti-Japanese War, and also seemed to be carrying terrible green germs. Of course, we used reserve notes, but 400 yuan of legal tender before the reserve notes was equivalent to one yuan of legal tender after the victory, but no one complained.</p>
<p>Planes brought discrimination from the rear: schools, institutions...in all kinds of places, people in the occupied areas were simply traitors! This mentality is wrong, and the actions based on this mentality are also wrong. If this mentality and style do not change for a long time, division and unrest are inevitable; the Taiwan incident is just an "example."</p>
<h3>A Scholar Visits the Soldiers</h3>
<p>— Qilou</p>
<p>A certain day of a certain month was one of the rare years in our 4,500-year history of mutual slashing when we laid down the butcher knife. At that time, the world was peaceful, and several scholars in Qufu, Shandong, picked some pears from a pear tree that they believed to be the tree of truth, and went to visit the soldiers all over the country to preach the truth to them.</p>
<p>They formed two teams and set off in different directions. Now we are only talking about the journey of one team.</p>
<p>This group of scholars arrived at the border and were about to enter the territory of Jiangsu Province, but they were stopped by several soldiers guarding the tombs. The scholars said "That's great," they were just about to talk to the soldiers. So they took out the fruit of truth, but these fruits were not yet ripe. The soldiers took a bite and spit it out quickly. "Such a sour thing!"</p>
<p>The scholars fled from under the guns. When the frozen pears gradually ripened, they arrived in a large city. The prosperous scene made their hearts sway. That night, they touched the women on the road, and were caught by soldiers passing by. One of the clever scholars took out some fruits of truth and bought out everyone.</p>
<p>Walking south again, they arrived in a warm area. The soldiers here were undergoing demobilization training, which was indeed a peaceful scene. The scholars, holding a few rotten fruits, were welcomed to preach the truth.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, at this time, another team of scholars also arrived. In order to compete for the seat, the two teams of scholars scolded each other, accusing each other of being fox spirits, determined that they were the true Taoist scholars, and used the few remaining rotten fruits as weapons to throw at each other. As a result, the soldiers who were training were also aroused by the enthusiasm for struggle and joined the battle. The butcher knife that had just been put down was raised again. And the rare peace disappeared in an instant.</p>
<p>The scholars were afraid of the war and fled back in different directions. When they arrived in Qufu, they inevitably made a report, which was considered an explanation. The report said how many soldiers they had met, and the later conflict between the two teams. They did not preach the truth to the soldiers. At that time, a historian (of course, also a scholar) felt that the text was too superficial, so he used the style of the Spring and Autumn Annals to write:</p>
<p>"When scholars meet soldiers, there is no way to reason."</p>
<h3>Talking About Yan Song and He Shen</h3>
<p>— Aiju</p>
<p>Greed and extravagance are the most intense of evils, even more so than floods and fierce beasts. They not only harm the officialdom, harm society, harm the country, but also cause its destruction. Like Rong Qing and others mentioned above, they themselves cannot enjoy it for long, and will eventually be ruined and discredited. Yan Song of the late Ming Dynasty and He Shen of the former Qing Dynasty are examples. After Song was defeated, he was already eighty years old, and Shi Lou had been executed. Song became a beggar and died wandering. But even today, reading the Bingshanlu, Song's confiscated property, in addition to calligraphy, paintings, steles and rare items, even the gold items are colorful and dazzling. It is certainly not comparable to the confiscated property of various traitors in the anti-Japanese era. How can the stockpiling of gold bars and the purchase of large buildings be dreamed of by a huge greedy thief? As for He Kun, he was only a sedan chair lifter at the beginning. I don't know what words he used, but suddenly he was praised. At the end of Qianlong's reign, he was in a position to crown hundreds of officials. All provinces had to plunder and collect a share of any gifts. Sometimes it was even better than the tribute. It is said that Jiaqing accidentally broke a jadeite plate set in a certain hall at the end of Qianlong's reign, which was deeply loved by Emperor Gaozong. He searched all the major antique shops in Beijing, but could not find it. Someone jokingly suggested that He Shen had it, and repeatedly asked He Shen for it. It was only then that he obtained it, and it was even higher than the original Chen's item. He Shen has always been rude to the princes, and Jiaqing has been accumulating resentment for a long time. This time, he was ridiculed by He, and Jiaqing could not contain his anger. After Emperor Chun died, Jiaqing immediately confiscated it and put Shen to justice. The charges were obvious and recorded in the Donghualu. At that time, there was a rumor that He Shen fell and Jiaqing was full, and the stolen goods he greedily obtained were no less than the Bingshanlu. Alas! The lessons of Song and Shen are a warning. Why do the major officials who are robbing today, because of extravagant enjoyment, do their best to be greedy and take their own destruction? Does Shang Lai Zhen Fang follow this?</p>
<h3>Broaden Your Mind</h3>
<p>— Yang Zhimin</p>
<p>"Life is a ruthless enemy, and the cost of living index is a powerful force to defend against the enemy's assaults." That's what we used to say, but what about now? Everyone knows that this powerful force has been completely defeated. In that case, from now on, we can only respectfully welcome the ruthless enemy to invade directly.</p>
<p>"Today no rice, tomorrow no firewood," this kind of mental anguish will come to us sooner or later. Therefore, when close friends meet, they all use the idiom "broaden your mind" as an excuse.</p>
<p>In order for us to truly achieve the state of "broadening our minds," the government must provide us with a stable life. To have a stable life, the first thing is that prices cannot continue to rise indiscriminately, and the rationed goods must have a fixed price, a fixed date, and possibly some leeway in time. Don't squeeze and jostle, causing people to feel unpleasant mentally. I think this should be a right that people within a possible scope deserve. Although this cannot be said to be a matter of "broadening our minds," in the hearts of us (the people), we will at least feel the government's kindness.</p>
<h3>Literary and Art World</h3>
<p>The poet Xu Zhimo had two unpublished diaries and about thirty original poems and paintings inscribed by Tagore, Hu Shih, Yang Xingfo, Wen Yiduo, and others before his death. His wife, Ms. Lu Xiaoman, has now compiled them into a "Zhimo Diary," which will be included in the Chenguang Literary Series by Chenguang Publishing Company and will be published soon.</p>
<p>The twelfth of this month is Tian Han's fiftieth birthday and the thirtieth anniversary of his creative work. Chen Baichen and others have launched a grand celebration. In addition to inviting Guo Moruo and other drama figures to give speeches, there will also be Tian Han's drama recitations, improved Yue opera ballads, and other programs to add to the fun.</p>
<p>The National Central Library's journal has been reissued and is sold by Kaiming Bookstore. Subscriptions are not available for the time being. The first issue of the reissue contains works by He Changqun, Jiang Liangfu, Zhao Jingshen, and others.</p>
<p>The translator Geng Jizhi, who followed Zhang Jia'ao to the Northeast to serve as the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Chinese-Changchun Railway two years ago, died of a cerebral hemorrhage in Shenyang on the second of this month. Geng's wife and children are all in Shanghai. Zhang Jia'ao is responsible for handling the funeral arrangements. (Jing Gu)</p>
<p>Guotai Bookstore, located at 115 Hankou Road (east of Jiangxi Road), lends out books, including academic research, magazines, scripts, etc., especially novels, for only over one hundred yuan per day. (Serving amateurs, office hours are from 1:00 PM to 5:30 PM daily.)</p>
<h3>Sichuan Landscape Painting</h3>

<h3>Record of a City in Peril</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>As soon as he left, the female guest cried even more fiercely. Although she could not bear his abuse, her habit of not being independent made her feel that she had to rely on Xiao Shen. Once Xiao Shen left, abandoning her, what would she do? In her heart, in these times of war and chaos, it was impossible to survive without a man to lean on.</p>
<p>"Ah! You two have really made a mess of things!" Lu Qian couldn't help but sigh again.</p>
<p>"What are you afraid of? If Jin wants to go with us, then we'll take her!" The older child playing the harmonica said without thinking.</p>
<p>"Really! What's there to be afraid of? Apart from the dozen or so people from the People's Education Center, we're only a little over twenty people together. What difference does it make if we add Jin?" Several older children who didn't know the immensity of it all said this.</p>
<p>The former was angry. Jin just cried.</p>
<p>"Don't be afraid! Miss Jin, at worst, you can perform with us in the play!" One of the girls tried her best to comfort this pitiful woman.</p>
<p>"I...I...can't..." she replied, with a sob in her voice.</p>
<p>"Then you can do some work in our theater troupe."</p>
<p>"I...I...also don't...know how to read..."</p>
<p>This made the enthusiastic young ladies feel embarrassed! They hadn't seen much of the world and had never thought that in this day and age, there were still women who were dressed very fashionably, but were actually incapable of doing anything, and lived like parasites all year round.</p>
<p>"That doesn't matter, let her cook for us, that's also useful!" The older child playing the harmonica stubbornly said.</p>
<p>"But, Zhang Chang, even we don't know how to leave!" Lu the cripple showed a look of anxiety. "Ah! You guys mean well, but don't harm Miss Jin..."! Someone wanted to interrupt him, but he waved his hand and said painfully, "She and Xiao Shen are doing business, they have plenty of transportation, and they might be able to go tomorrow or the day after. But what about us? Of course, we don't want to leave now, but when it really comes time to leave, do you think we'll have a car? Ah! Look! The troops being transferred to the front lines for reinforcements have to walk barefoot, how can there be transportation for us?"</p>
<p>Miss Jin cried even more sadly.</p>
<p>"Old Lu is always pessimistic!" Several people said this. "If we don't have trucks, can't we squeeze onto a train?"</p>
<p>"Okay, everyone, watch and see!" Lu Qian said helplessly, and finally wanted to sigh again, but before he could, someone they had been waiting for for a long time walked in from outside the door.</p>
<p>More than twenty voices shouted in unison: "Old Zhu! Old Zhu!" (8)</p>
