<h3>被俘美軍官談　險遭中共處死</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿六日電〕美軍副武官瑞格少校與柯林斯上尉，頃在招待記者會上談述被中共拘禁後之經過情形稱：吾等在拘禁期間，曾獲悉東北中共將開「人民法庭」，以間諜罪加以審問，幷將判以死刑，直至四月九日朱德致電李立三，令其釋放後，始獲免遭此命運。在最初三十五日內曾屢遭拷問，欲以迫打，使吾等招認爲國軍從事間諜工作。四月九日接獲朱德通知釋放之訓令後，待遇始見改善，幷准許至哈爾濱遊覽，或上街買物，但中共軍乃以戰俘對待，幷不承認吾二一人之外交官地位。中共在哈埠曾三度恐嚇吾等，揚言欲拷打吾等，幷謂，此項拷打係國際法所允許者，然吾等從未信及此語，彼等之威脅亦未使吾等加以任何嚴重考慮。</p>
<p>瑞格幷稱，渠與柯林斯二人，偕華籍譯員及司機各一人，當聞及共軍在長春城外十三哩處有活動時，曾決赴長春前綫一行，蓋渠頗担心其居留該處之眷屬也。彼等趕赴前綫，未及三哩之遙，見有哨兵二人，譯員受驚圖逃返吉普車，遂遭機槍之掃射，柯林斯正首當其衝，幸撲臥溝內而得免，彼等於是即被繳除武器而被帶往司令部。</p>

<p>「國際勞工組織憲章修正案」：國際勞工組織大會經國際勞工局理事院之召集，於一九四六年九月十九日在濛翠爾城舉行第廿九屆會議。大會對於本屆會議議程第二項所列國勞組織憲章修正問題，經各方所提之各項提議，決定予以採納，爰於一九四六年十月九日通過下列國勞組織憲章修正案。又是項修正案得稱爲一九四六年國勞組織憲章修正案。</p>
<p>第一條　其現行條文載在未修正案附件第一行列之國際勞工組織憲章，自本修正案開始發生效力之日起，即行依照該附件第二行列所載修正方式發生效力。</p>
<p>第二條　本修正案樣本兩份應由大會主席和國際勞工局局長予以簽署，其中一份應存入國際勞工局案卷，另一份應送交聯合國秘書長，傳便依照聯合國憲章第一〇二條之規定，予以登記，局長並應將本修正案校正本分送國勞組織各會員國。</p>
<p>第三條　（一）凡對本修正案之正式批准書或承認書，應即檢送國際勞工局局長，以便通知國勞組織各會員國。（二）本修正案應依照國際勞工組織憲章第三十六條之規定開始發生效力。（三）本修正案一經開始發生效力，國際勞工局局長應即通吿國際勞工組織各會員國，聯合國秘書長及簽署聯合國憲章之各國。</p>

<h3>社論　抑平米價的對策</h3>
<p>民食問題近來確很嚴重。雖經當局一再撳低，連日拋售，但市塲上依舊有行無市。有許多米店家，竟推說無貨應市，見不到白粳。其聊以應市的，也不過少數秈米，甚至連秈米也沒有，眞是咄咄怪事。</p>
<p>因爲按照事實，本市並未缺米。除掉公私積存的不算，雖說到貨稀少，而每天一二千石的到米，在市塲上登記的，還是陸續不絕，其他未上市塲的，無從統計。其統計最爲可靠的，當推社會局逐日拋售的九千包。其中有白粳，有貢米，有紅尖。依照人口計算，卽此一萬幾千石的供給，維持本市民食，已屬綽綽有餘，何况當局表示，必要時，尙可增加。</p>
<p>所以本問題的癥結，已顯然不在供給，而在於囤積和走私，卽所謂流入黑市。這是很有憑證的。（一）當局派警嚴査出口，防止倒流。如果無走私情弊，何必如此嚴防？（二）前昨兩日，經警社兩局査獲囤米不賣的米店已有好多起，這豈非米商囤積居奇的實例？</p>
<p>今當局正在雷厲風行，分組偵査，這些囤積和走私的情弊，當然可以繼續發現，依法懲治。但所成爲問題的，就是此等手段，能否根絕黑市，維持正常的民食？換句話說：那些黑市商人，會不會重視這個禁令而翻然變計，不再故意和當局鬥法？這恐怕誰也不敢保證吧！現在提獎最豐，罰則最重，査緝最密的，無過於金鈔，而金鈔黑市仍然始終沒有絕跡。可知單靠査禁，抓捕這些手段，要達到穩定米市，維持民食這願望，事實上也恐怕還有相當的距離。</p>
<p>消極手段，旣未能完全達到目的，那末，窮則變，就不得不採取進一步的措置了。這進一步的措置，究應如何入手？我們認爲有兩條途徑可循。</p>
<p>其一，餒格實施代購制度，以安定公敎人員及職工之生活。經濟緊急措施方案規定「各工廠爲供應工人所需之食糧，布匹，燃料，應請由政府代購，不得自由採購，變相囤積。」而在民生日用必需物品供應辦法實施細則內，對於公敎人員及職工之日用必需品，其如何供應分配辦法，更有詳密的規定。其第六條內，並載明：「政府於必要時出售物品，調劑市塲。」實行之初，雖以籌備不及，對於職工部分，一槪折發差金，以期簡捷，這原屬一時權宜之計。今米價飛漲，各米店旣有無貨應市之象，自應由主管機關切實負責代購，按照定量配售之原則，以實物照數供應，以安定一般職工之生活。職工與公敎人員，僅屬市民之一部份，在實施定量配售以後，整個的民食問題，雖未必能完全解決，但比所拋的米糧，紛紛流入黑市，徒飽一、般奸商之腰棄者，究屬較勝一籌，且工糧有着，則工人較爲安定，卽工潮亦可期减少。故除公敎人員之食米，照案辦理外，對於一般職工，亦有配發實物之必要。今政府所握米糧，相當充足，我們認爲除此類職工外，其他行號，團體，私立學梭，所有員役，夥友，亦不妨准其造送名册，定量照配，以求實惠之均沾，而期米市之穩定。</p>
<p>其二，照食糖例，按照戶口，實行配給。這方法最爲澈底，亦最爲合理。因爲照此辦理，只須配給量足敷實用，配給價不在鄰近區域的自由價以上，根本就不會發生黑市。而公家所拋售的米糧，自然粒粒惠及平民了。據聞有關方面，亦已有人提議及此。所遲遲未敢決定的，因爲有兩種困難。一是辦理上需要多數的人手和費用，不能照食糖和公敎人員的定量配給例，可以因人成事，完全托人代辦。二是配米須有着落，可以源源撥用，不便忽作忽輟，也不便完全仰賴中央。以上這兩種顧慮，都是事實，的確須愼重考慮。本來辦理配給，是一件十分繁瑣而又需要賠錢的事。如果單憑口惠，貪圖簡省，部就根本談不到此事。否則保甲和戶口，已辦有相當基礎，而且食糖的配給，已在繼續舉辦中，只須再設立一個主管的機關，總司其事，或將現存類似配給之機構擴充改組一下，似乎第一種人事上的困難，尙不難予以解決。至於食米來源，的確比較繁重。但除糧部撥充以外，最近又有洋米到埠。只須有專管機關負責去採辦，也並非不可能的事。因爲內地產價雖貴，而存糧並未到十分枯竭的地步，在塾本和運輸方面，如果由當地政府舉辦起來，總要此私人便利些。據傳江蘇已有禁米出省之說，以後米商採運的力量，不免更形削弱。事實上，也不能不由官廳出來担負一部份責任，以暢來源。那末，唯一顧慮之點，無非要賠些錢而已。</p>
<p>凡辦政治，總不免要賠些錢，只須看賠得是否上算，於人民是否眞正有益。所謂取之於民，用之於民，這個原則，不是常常爲財政人員所樂道的嗎？</p>
<p>所以辦理米糧配給的經費，與其說應否考慮，還不如說願否考慮來得切實。</p>
<p>自古說，『民以食爲天』，米價如能平定，則民心亦就可以安定下來。從而物價，工資，生活，市面，乃至社會的安寗秩序，也述帶地可以解決一部份。自從去年吳市長就任以來，對於民食，他的確十分注重，曾盡了最大的努力，這可謂獨見其大。不過爲根絕黑市，確保民食的供應起見，上面這兩個建議，雖是老生常談，似乎還可以提供大家研究。如能付諸實施，我們相信，其功效總不會在單純的拋售，和消極的査緝以下。</p>

<h3>白宮定今晚開會　檢討美外交政策　當前美蘇關係極堪注目　杜魯門邀國會領袖聽取馬卿報告</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿五日電〕馬歇爾國務卿定於星期二標準時間上午一時三十分（上海時間晚十時三十分）廣播莫斯科會議之經過。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿五日電〕杜魯門總統今日邀請國會兩黨領袖於廿七日夜間在白宮與國務卿馬歇爾會議，檢討外交政策之前途。馬歇爾正自莫斯科返國，以便於廿八日夜間向全國報吿莫斯科外長會議經過，並在國會答復關於外交政策之新問題。據國務院宣布：馬歇爾於廿八日晚向全國廣播半小時，以後數日或將與國會議員會談。馬歇爾二月間赴莫斯科時，義大利和約與三億五千萬元救濟解放國家計劃兩大問題，似已結束，但在馬歇爾出國期間，善於指摘之國會議員又舊事重提。各參議員希望馬歇爾根據草斯科會議結果，就美蘇現階段關係，提出全面報吿。主要問題爲四億元之援助希土方案。該案已經參院核准，將於下星期在衆院表決。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿五日電〕某負責官員本日語法國新聞社記者稱：馬歇爾國務卿一俟返抵華府之後，殆將首先與杜魯門總統討論泛美洲會議之可能性以及促使巴西於六七月間召開此項會議所當採取之措施。在事實上，自莫斯科四國外長會議失敗之後，美國外交家均與陸海軍兩部意見一致，認爲美洲各國簽訂國際防衛公約，俾確保西半球之團結一致，並挫折蘇聯參入之企圖，實屬必要。就目前情形而言，杜魯門總統及馬帥似均主張迅即通過一項法律，准許美國之美洲國際公約之範圍內，並以戰事配備供給拉丁美洲，以使西半球所有國家之標準化。欲連到此一目的，馬帥必須消除國務院拉丁美洲事務帮辦勃蘭登與阿根廷政府間之意見不同，並確定阿國政府是否履行加布爾德貝克公約所規定之養務。勃蘭登認爲美國必須在阿國政府履行其所有義務之後，然後始可簽訂美洲國際防衛公約。</p>
<h3>馬卿自柏林飛華府</h3>

<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿六日電〕報載英外相貝文向政府提議設立西方德國並取消德境英美法佔領區間界綫之說，頃由外務部加以否認。</p>
<h3>莫斯科會議失敗　日輿論一斑</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿六日電〕莫斯科外長會議無結果而散，日本方面對之失望與希望兼而有之。懷有希望者以爲歐洲方面之僵局足以加速商訂對日和約，現望麥帥再作主張。惟對於戰爭猶痛定思痛者，鑒於蘇聯與西方各國之相持不下，一致深感憂鬱。日本觀察家稱：莫斯科方面形勢黑暗致引起此間不可思議之謠言，有謂美蘇戰爭六月間不免爆發者，有謂美軍正在加緊訓練日本航空員者，許多東京人士甚几神經過敏，有已遷往鄕間逃避戰事者。英斯科會議進行情形，日人甚爲注意，對於美英堅決反對蘇聯立即自德國工業生產中提出賠償一層，尤引以自慰，以爲他日舉行對日和會提出同樣問題時，英美或者亦可代爲主張云。</p>
<h3>聯大特會明揭幕　討論巴勒斯坦問題　我國由郭泰祺任首席代表</h3>

<p>五強商討　議事程序</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿五日電〕五强代表包括我國代表郭泰祺在內，今日下午曾就廿八日聯合國大會之程序問題，與秘書長賴伊作非正式會商。記者自可靠方面探悉，（一）在討論時，並未探求蘇聯對於阿拉伯國家所提立即開始全盤討論巴勒斯坦獨立問題一項建議所持態度，（二）五强曾非正式同意巴西前外長阿哈爲本屆大會王席最適當人選；（三）此外五强得以大會副主席之資格，將尙餘之二副主席職位，畀予哥倫比亞代表羅倍茲及印度或菲律賓代表。又悉，五强曾討論大會六個常委會主席之問題，並贊成由加拿大，捷克，埃及，瑞典，印度及波蘭或墨西哥祖任，彼等並將商定大會之有力之指導委會委員人選。據傳五强並同意正式歡迎暹羅以聯合國新會員國地位參加大會。</p>
<p>阿拉伯國　表明立塲</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社開羅廿五日電〕阿拉伯人對於巴勒斯坦問題之主張，將由阿拉伯同盟七國中之五國，向聯合國特別大會提出，該五國爲埃及·叙利亞·黎巴嫰·伊拉克·與沙地阿拉伯，葉門與外約但並非聯合國會員國，故不參加陳述。惟該五國並未由其上司巴勒斯坦最高委會授予全權，該委會曾宣佈可以否認該五國之任何決定，委員會本身正派遣代表兩人出席聯大會旁聰，彼等將與聯合國機構阿拉伯代表保持接觸。巴勒斯坦之阿拉伯人立塲明顯，彼等堅持兩點，即（一）樹立巴勒斯坦阿拉伯獨立國；（二）猶太人完全停止移入巴勒斯坦。此種立塲多少與一九三九年英國白皮書中規定者相似。</p>

<h3>社會局發表驚人囤積案　查獲食糖十八萬包　分存四棧貨屬六十家行號所有　飭令應市銷售價待評議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局昨發表澈査一驚人之囤積秘魯糖案經過，數達十八萬七千二百八十六包。然因食糖被列入應行取締囤積之物品，方由社會局於四月廿五日佈吿。因該項囤積之糖則爲本年一月間事，故社會局僅予以應市銷售之處分，價格猶待物價評議會食糖小糾開會議定。</p>
<p>緣社會局於本月初接獲密吿，聲稱本市提籃橋怡和打包廠，公和祥碼頭信益公司堆棧，東大名路上海倉庫及上海閘路倉庫內，堆存有大批食糖。吳局長乃於四月十一日乎諭該局職員祝寳和，祝寳恒兩人前往調査存糖數量，堆存之店號及糖之種類。當査得公和祥碼頭七，九，十七，廿八號四倉庫存有信益公司之秘書糖七萬五千九百七十包。係於今年一月十一日存入，原共十萬包，係信益公司代均益等四十家訂購。在貨到時已將全部提貨單分發，各行家可持單直接向公和祥提貨。至於公和祥每日出貨之記錄，僅記信益公司而未記糖行店號。故各行現存確數一時甚難査明。復査明怡和打包廠，位於楊樹浦路一〇五六號，內存美隆洋行秘魯糖八萬零三百六十包，係於今年二月間存入，原共十萬零一千二百七十四包。是項糖係該洋行代昌興等二十七家訂購，其交貨手續與信益公司同。又査東大名路一〇八〇號上海倉庫存有昌興秘魯糖二萬九千零五十六包。又閘路倉庫亦存有昌興秘魯糖一千九百包。以上四家倉庫現存實數，共計十八萬七千二百八十六包，分屬六十家行號。其中龍昌，聯和，震華，元泰恒，久華，生記新，利達，和源，阜源，和興，德昌，仁承，源豐恒，裕康，裕豐恒，李星記，大生，均益，動和，大德恒，大華製糖廠，大益恒，捷成，惠火，成大，振業，昌典，隆昶，同順，益昌，鑫和，公大，義和，益源，恒餘，恒元仁等三十六家糖行均已至社會局申請商業登記。尙有屈臣氏汽水公司亦已申請公司設立登記（但非糖行）。其他聯美等廿三家則尙未聲請糖商登記。吳局長顧處長於審核情形後，認爲案情適合非常時期取締日用重要物品囤積居奇辦法第七條第八條第儿條之規定，蓋食糖被列爲應行取締囤積之物品，方經社會局於四月廿五日佈吿在案，其所囤積之糖，則爲本年一月間事，當決定處理辦法爲不論是項食糖之所有權人爲經營本業之商人，或非經營本業之商人，或非經營商業之人，一併交由市商會督同糖商業同業公會應市銷售，報局備査。</p>
<h3>路局召開會議　檢討出軌原因　認係枕木過舊石碴鬆寬所致　須換枕木百餘萬根</h3>
<p>兩路局爲今後行車安全及研討此次兩度出軌之原因，特於昨日下午召開行車安全會議，出席運務處，機務處，及工務處各處處長副處長技術員等。陳局長因公在京，由副局長兼運務處處長侯或華主持。會議至下午七時許始散，定今日繼續討論。據侯副局長語記者稱：昨日會議開始，即研究金陵號及第六次快車之出軌原因，結果對外界指責之各點，有所說明；（一）美國現行路軌及車輸之寬度，與中國全部相同，故金陵號加掛美國車廂，並非出事主因。（二）金陵號每一車廂，可容重量十八噸，如以乘客六十位計算，加入行李亦不過十噸左右，故對出軌亦無關係。（三）根據事實與經騐，行車之多少，對路軌並無影響，故京滬路雖每日客貨車共有四十次之多，亦不致出軌。除上列各點外，此次出軌之主因，恐爲枕木使用過久，而石碴亦經久未換，致因鬆寬而發生危險。現路局已決定總動員察勘全綫枕木及石碴。惟調換忱木，因經費及購買材料均非易事，故頗感困難。路局自復員以來，京滬綫枕木經調査結果，須調換者需一百餘萬根，而迄目前爲止，僅調換二十餘萬根，此種困難情形及昨日開會之結果，路局已據實報吿交通部，請示一切。交部本擬派員列席路局之行車安全會議，後因時間匆促，不及趕到云云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕蘇北流亡難民爲已製成營業三輪車輛，申請當局發給牌照，維持兩萬餘人生活，昨午假中央菜社招待記者，據流亡難民代表稱：渠等千餘人連同眷屬兩萬餘人，均係蘇北良民因受兵燹，來滬避亂，迫於生計，以典借利貸，籌款購置三輪車一千餘輛，均委託本市各車行代辦申請捐照，並先行無照入市行駛，一家生活，勉强得以維持，詎去年七月五日市府頒佈停止發給三輪車牌照佈吿，各該車行乘機利用牌照稅法「凡已向其他縣市捐領牌照之車輛，經過或停留本縣市不超過兩個月者，得免征牌照稅」之規定，向寳山嘉定等縣捐領營業三輪車牌照，以高價售給渠等，繼續行駛營業。惟警局方面視爲違令，拘車押照，罰鍰甚重，渠等乃知受騙，雖迭向車行索還牌照價款，均故意諉拖，置渠等痛苦於不顧，其間雖經政府予以法律制裁，然渠等所受之損失，迄今未蒙責令償還。用特分向當局，市參議會，三輪車職工會睛願。渠等復提出六項理由，要求當局速發牌照，准予行駛中區，以救濟此兩萬餘流民之生活</p>

<h3>破獲地下鐵莊　私營銀元賣買　拘捕四犯訊究</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕警察局經濟科，前日午後在福州路三六一號破瘦經營黑市金鈔及銀幣之「地下錢莊」一處，當塲截獲擬持往「交割」之銀幣三千一百七十一元，美鈔三百九十五元，拘獲送「貨」者金道洪，曲慶齋，黄玉生，王鳳行等四名。該錢莊名寳華，經理爲鎭江人潘仲英，於案發後已潛匿，現正由警局査捕中。査該寳華錢莊與山東路中正路口寳康錢莊係同一系統，曾在本市淪陷期內爲敵人搜購鎳幣起家。勝利後，復以「地下錢莊」姿態，除經營金鈔買賣外，復兼營拆放。自政府頒佈緊急方案禁止黄金美鈔賣買後，該錢莊等仍暗中經營黑市交易，警局經濟科數日前已接獲報吿，當即派員化裝前往守候，直至前日午後五時，始被截獲。惟當時因人手缺乏，待再度會同保甲長前往該錢莊檢査帳目及保險箱時，一無所獲。至寳康錢莊買賣黑市黄金則已獲有證據，該莊協理陳正洪昨已被帶局値訊。</p>

<p>潘議長</p>
<p>致詞，略謂：本市各區區民代表會及民選區長均已分別糾　完成，民治基礎業經確立。今日希望各區代表及區長盡量發表意見，以供本會在五月中舉行之第三次大會採納。並請各機關首長提供施政方針以資參考。此外對於本會於去年決議之獻校祝壽計劃，亦希各位共同努力推動，期早日完成。</p>
<p>吳市長</p>
<p>致詞：（一）市參議會與市府合作精神可謂全國第一，區民代表大會主席與區長皆係民選，希望雙方感情更能融治。同時希望代表大會與市參議會之聯繫亦更能加强。民意機構與政府機關合作後，則雖在此最艱難困苦時期，相信亦必能克服任何困難。（二）對於獻校祝壽一事，雖經主席來電令勿舉辦，但我國家之安危，全國人民之命運，均寄托在主席一身，我們紀念他壽辰，實應自動，一方而爲文化，一方面爲自己子弟，此舉當共同贊助。地方法院</p>
<p>查院長</p>
<p>表示：上海於勝利以後，過去各法院及各國臨時法庭未了案件，現均由地方法院審理，故事務異常煩忙，本人感到責任重大而能力有限，但司法人員必須要做到（一）有冷靜的頭腦，（二）客觀的態度，（三）公正的見解，（四）無畏的精神，以處理案件。</p>
<p>嚴臨使</p>
<p>發表感想數點，謂上海情形複雜，過去百年來受外人統治，至今一般人對舊有道德及社會秩序觀念均已遺忘，希望重整。此外，地方上時有不安情形發生，使市民受到莫大痛苦，亦須賴大衆設法解除。本人站在監察地位，希望市民，尤其是參議會，區民代表大會時常說話，對市府各機關人員有何越軌行動，貪汚情形，都能來監察署檢舉。市黨部</p>
<p>方主委</p>
<p>則希望市民在政府改組後，共同建設大上海，新中國，並用民衆呼聲，喚醒未參加政府之各　各派人士，勿再作不民主之表現，致使人民痛苦。</p>
<p>旋由敎育局顧局長報吿推動獻校事宜，希望市民有一分力量，盡一分力量，建設學校，不論多寡，祗望爲文化工作努力。</p>
<p>民政處張處長則希望喚起市民注意建設地方自治，而行政當局對地方自治不應祇採取外國制度，而應按我國固有之地方社會經濟情形應實施。</p>
<p>王劍鍔區長代表區民表示目前感到最痛苦者，爲人民對地方自治不明瞭，而政府負責人對之又並不重視，希望參議會督促指導並重視區保軍。對獻校祝壽決努力去做，惟希望政府施政能使人民滿意。嗣又有區民代表數位及警備司令部稽査處長陶一珊等相繼發言。該會至六時始散。</p>
<h3>僞特工總部處長　沈鳳岡受審　述制裁僞員經過　一副醜表功姿態　陳恭澍被提作證</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕曾任僞特工總部第三處處長，兼特務第一大隊長沈鳳岡，昨日在高院受審，幷傳在押之前軍統局上海區區長陳恭澍到庭作證。沈衣藍布套袍，而露笑容，供稱：我於二十八年八月七日爲「七十六號」逮捕，奉命參加僞組織，於九月三日任僞特工總部第三處長。</p>
<p>光頭開了一槍</p>
<p>繼以丑表功之姿態，陳述其制裁僞員之經過情形，自稱經過其手制裁者，有兩件火事，（一）僞維新政府時代「上海市政府」情報主任王永奎，（二）耿嘉基。主開房間於四馬路致美樓一號，俟其晚間送客出門時，我對其光頭開了一槍，應聲而倒，旁邊保鏢正欲拔槍，被我的隨從人員開槍打倒，我看王身體仍在蠕動，又對胸口補了一槍，然後離去。此案曾向軍統局上海區行動第二隊長陳默報吿，陳又向當時之上海區陳恭澍報吿。</p>

<h3>訓練人才　修造木船　漁管處兩項工作　計劃發展我漁業</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行總復興島漁業管理處處長王人麟，自月前接任後，對該處工作，決定以訓練漁業人才爲第一，俾將來能使用新式漁輪，大規模發展我國漁業。</p>
<p>據王氏談稱：該處除上海外，尙將在台灣·靑島·廣東·定海舟山羣島附近等，設立四處。其中台灣分處已成立，已派漁輪七艘駛赴該處。靑島亦已有漁輪三艘駛往。廣東擬於下月初派輪一艘，舟山附近不久亦可成立。此舉一方面能使所有漁輪不致集中於上海一地，一方面亦可就地訓練人員。蓋各地漁業人員言語，習慣，水性熟悉情形均各有不同，不宜全部來滬。同時該處已擬定各業公司保送技術人員受訓辦法，將於下週推動此工作。因該處現有漁輪所有權仍屬聯總，必須有確能使用新式漁輪之人員，亦可分配與各漁業公司。至受訓人員之膳宿雜用均歸漁管處供給，受訓期共九週。</p>
<p>該處第二部重要工作，據王氏稱乃修造木船。聯總供給該處木料共有三萬五千噸，現已到五分之二（一萬四千噸），尙有其他配件，故該處計劃建造新木船五千隻，修舊木船三千五百隻。新船將按沿海各地需要及戰前數量平均分配，舊木船修理材料可免費，僅貼補工資，亦將訂定辦法，由漁民合作社報告數量並申請，可於五月中旬開始進行。</p>
<p>現有船隻一百餘艘　每次出發三週來回</p>
<p>記者昨日前往復興島參觀該處漁輪，承王處長偕該處行政顧問聯總代表納喜，副處長王以康等招待報吿處內近况，並由分配主任莊前鼎陪同參觀。據吿，該處現有美國漁輪三十四艘，澳洲船四十七艘，連同其他各種輔助船共一百六十餘艘。英國漁輪每艘約重一百四十噸，內有最新式之測水機，指示方向機，無綫電機可與漁站及各輪間通話。又輪上均有電氣冰箱可存儲船員食物。至儲魚窖內則置有人造冰，鮮魚存於其間可十日不腐。各輪每次出發來回約三夏期，最多時可捕魚一千餘担。所捕之鮮售與魚市塲。輪上有中外船長（負駕駛之職），機械師，總務，漁夫受訓技術人員等共約十四人。</p>
<p>該處捕魚所售得之款，除船上一部份開支外，由中外人員共同分紅，薪金另付。華籍漁夫每月底薪自四十元至七十元不等。</p>

<h3>西摩路大火案判決　尙志魁等三名各處刑一年半　公共危險竊盜部份不予受理</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕西摩路大火案涉嫌消防警二十三人，自地檢處分別以盜匪罪，公共危險及竊盜罪提起公訴後，迭經地院審理，昨日宣判。盜匪罪部份判決主文：「尙志魁，戴光榮，李成鈞乘火災之際竊盜，各處有期徒刑一年六月，其餘被訴部份無罪，蔡治英無罪。在覆判期間准交五百萬元書面保，停止覊押」。公共危險及竊盜罪嫌部份「黄寳琦，李勳，朱慶瀾，趙榮臣，黄克勤，劉繼漢，王振三，楊阿寳，周尊武，王松青，湯長生，楊慶善，羅靑，顧福根，王鐘秀，王鳳安，李阿山，均無罪，周悅寰，劉連壁業已死亡，公訴不予受理」。梅爾和推事之判決理由，略謂：被吿黄寳琦等檢察官認坐視火火延燒不施灌救，無異放火，應負公共危險罪責。査當時火勢極熾，玻璃已被溶化，致火横竄，二十七·二十九號亦先後被波及，經證人等所供大火蔓延原因甚多，不能歸罪於被吿等少數人。關於竊盜罪起訴部份，諸被吿雖會進出二十七·二十九號之各災戶，然無犯罪證據，要難令其受刑事處分。消防警士昨往旁聽者甚衆，聞判後莫不欣喜萬狀，轟動一時之大火案至此遂吿一段落。</p>

<h3>星島戰和漢城　球迷如痴如狂　人潮洶湧逸園遭蹂躪　五萬觀衆多人被軋傷</h3>
<p>香港星島足球隊，於前晚抵滬後，昨日下午四時與漢城足球隊相逢於於逸園球塲，球迷震於兩軍威名，作壁上觀者，約計五萬餘人。球塲四週大看台平頂，及南首平房屋項，盡爲球迷所佔據，開球賽以來未有之紀錄。遠地球迷，於一時前，即鵠立市體育館門前，等候買票，逸園大門，二時三十分左右，即爲人潮所衝壞人羣蜂擁時被擠受傷者，達二十餘人。其中經人發覺送廣慈醫院者，前後有兩人一爲王偉成年二十三歲，傷胸部頭部，勢頗嚴重。另一爲輕傷，名沈惠祥，年十七歲經醫治後即自行出院休養。此外如衣服被扯破或鞋襪被踩落者，更比比皆是。記者曾目睹一西童，身穿凡力丁西裝迨其從人業中擁出時，其長褲業已變成一條短褲，蓋其兩隻褲管，早爲他人踏碎無遺也。</p>
<p>比賽原定四時開始，惟四周竹籬坍倒，觀衆擁入球塲內圈，秩序混亂，嗣經警備郃武裝人員，處家灣警察分局義警及憲兵警察等，極力維持，始於四時三十五分勉强開賽，奈未滿二分鐘，又爲一部份球迷所搗亂，最後由保警大隊紅色警備車到塲彈壓，警局吉普車駛進球塲，與在塲之武裝人員密切合作下，羣衆始稍疏散，乃於五時二十分再度比賽，惟原有裁判員陳吉祥巡邊員何春暉與黄仁彝未見到塲，臨時改由沈回春執法巡邊由余衡之李寗擔任，因時間已晏，上下半塲各賽三十分鐘，結果零對零，未分勝負。</p>

<p>接觸後，漢城先攻，林暢植鄭南湜雙管齊下，「左脚王」獨擋一面，從容應付，張金海帶球疾進，小傳左角，曹秋亭反身弔門，被車淳鍾撲成角球，秋亭角球開來，落點奇佳，朴奎楨頭須救駕，球落中央，黎兆榮候個正着，出脚横掃，中横木彈出，車淳鍾冷汗一身，未幾漢城傾師來犯，許竟成退守第三丙衛，侯榕生八面玲瓏，頭頂脚踢，備見忙碌，漢城攻城不下，予星島反擊機會，幸防守嚴密，未有呈差池，未幾上半場即吿完畢。〇比〇未見高下。</p>
<p>易地再戰，雙方原陣未動，星島發動總攻擊，張金海率領之下，五鋒並進曹秋亭與門應芬兩翼齊飛，黎兆榮暗施冷箭，金奎煥頭頂化險。漢城乘機進攻，金容植，鄭南湜，與林暢植利用三角傳遞，大舉來襲，禹晶煥空擋竄進，於底角勾何，余耀德躍起接住，未遭毒手。雙方混戰良久，時間已至，均無紀錄而吿和。</p>

<h3>市長盃籃球決賽　哥倫布力挫華聯　最後廿秒鐘內一球定勝負</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市長盃籃球決賽，昨晚哥倫布在最後二十秒鐘由勃魯齊射中一球，以六十比五十八獲得市長盃。上半時卅一比廿九，華聯尙佔先二分。</p>
<p>因逸園足球賽秩序之紛擾，故主辦當局原擬改期，後因球隊通知鞠難，卒照常舉行，觀衆不下四千人。</p>
<p>哥倫布愛許進能攻退能守，獨得廿六分，可稱昨晚中西雙方最佳之一負。勃魯齊動作之快，令人難信，　林華大約翰俱勞苦功高。</p>
<p>華聯始終由五虎支持，苦戰到底，反之對方八人車輪大戰，以逸待勞，相差一球，非戰之罪也。</p>
<p>七時廿五分比賽開始，哥倫布勃魯齊愛許連中二球，華聯吃驚暫停，大約翰繼以一球，即成六分。華聯比際方由陳學祟中籃，陳吳包孔殺得興起，亦頻頻中的，但雙方勢盛，未幾又以十　比九領前，成章一罰一擲，成十二分平手。學崇二球，反以十六比十四超出二分，哥倫布倍納脫替特林華，亦請暫休，重商韜略，雙方均太緊張，孔李兩罰未中，反被勃羅齊瞬息二球華聯落後二分。旋得傳球良好，學崇追成十八平手，彼此劇戰，相差恒在一分間，最後華聯卅一比廿九，上半時佔先二分。</p>
<p>下半時吳成章先聲奪人，震中又遠中，愛許扳回一球，卅五比卅一，大小約翰各中一球，卅五平手。孔包增至卅八後，哥倫布又曾超出一分（四十比四十一）。不久華聯成四十四比四十三及五十一比四十六之優勢局面，特林華調小約翰，特上塲後鋒鋩大露，轉變局面成五十四平手，勃魯齊一球，哥倫布多二分。好容易震中打成平手，特林華成章勃魯齊順次中的，哥倫布以六十比五十八，在最後二十秒鐘決定大局。</p>
<p>哥倫布　擲　罰　犯　分</p>
<p>勃羅齊　七　二　三　十六</p>
<p>白勞福　〇　〇　一　〇</p>
<p>小約翰　一　〇　一　二</p>
<p>愛許　十一　四　四　廿六</p>
<p>奧勃林　〇　一　二　一</p>
<p>倍納脫　〇　〇　二　〇</p>
<p>特林華　三　〇　〇　六</p>

<h3>籃邊散記</h3>
<p>市長杯籃球賽男子組功德完滿：昨夕華聯與哥倫布決戰，華聯不幸在最後關頭，以一球之差，痛失錦標。</p>
<p>華聯起用孔廣益而棄任相成，未免失計，孔擅遠射，但傅運速度都不及相成，而昨賽在上半時，等於一塲氣力和速率的競爭，老孔動作比較起其餘九個人，顯見遲鈍，球接在手裏，幾乎沒有方法傳出，根本沒有機會作瞄準式的遠射也。</p>
<p>上半時，兩隊皆偏重攻勢，哥倫布五人俱有可畏的長力與速度，華聯這時顯然在使用錯誤的策略，和對方拼氣力，競速率，以及作射籃比賽，氣力拚完，下半時雖改用緩攻短傳，已經大爲吃虧。如果始終採用下半時的戰略，當是另一番局面。</p>
<p>以上兩點，我以爲是華聯昨晚失敗的主因。此外，哥倫布投籃技術，竿頭日進；對華隊的戰略，也漸習悉，亦是取得勝利的必具條件。</p>
<p>大李病後之軀，未能制伏愛許的活躍，大李臨時變計，改守爲攻，有射中五球的收穫——打破了近幾年來大李本人的紀錄。學祟穩健，阿弟太貪功，有幾次不應射而投籃，老包已盡最大努力。</p>
<p>對一隊實力相仿的隊伍作戰，華聯仍不免陷入心理上的慌張狀態，尤以老包和阿弟爲最。（昌年）</p>

<h3>全國工協昨向輸管會請願　交涉結果甚圓滿</h3>
<p>張總裁對於各點大體均表贊同</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕工業界代表錢祥標，洪念祖，田和卿，董和甫，奚正修，楊立人等六人，隨同全國工業協會理事長吳蘊初氏，於昨日上午十一時許赴中央銀行向輸入管理委員會請願。由張總裁親自接見，對各代表之要求，分別答覆如下：（一）對輸入限籍之分配應先交同業公會協商原則及數値，再由工商輔導處與工協組織審機會，共同商定一點，張氏表示贊同。（二）關於輸入必要之原料配件及生產器材之要求，張氏反問各代表：如得低廉之官價外匯後，將來成品出售時是否亦因此廉價？當由田和卿代表答發謂：廠家只求有合法利潤，決不在廉價原料中求取暴利，至於成品售價之決定，願採議價之制度。吳蘊初氏亦當塲表示：自限額制實施以來，原料價格已漲十倍，而成品不過漲一倍，故廠家之痛苦甚深，故希望今後原料能直接入生產者之手。張氏聆悉之餘，甚表同情，並希望工協對此能多做調査統計。（三）關於要求禁止非必要之成品一節，表示同情，並紛工協能開一詳單，以便轉交輸管會辦理。（四）關於提高限額之要求，張氏表示願接受工業界之意見，惟因政府外匯頭寸有限，恐難盡如人意。（五）關於二月十七日以前海外定貨之處理，張氏表示由各廠個別解決。代表國並提議以各廠之成品輸出國外，以易取外匯，爲本廠添置生產機器；張氏深表贊同。</p>
<p>關於工業貸款部份，代表團對提高工貸之具體數字並未提出；張氏對提高工貸及各公會對貸款作初步審査之要求，均表接受；對於要求增加審査委員名額一節，張氏允增加四五人，並請工協會同各業公會推選。又工協定上星期二召開會員大會，報吿請願經過。</p>
<h3>市長召米商談話　白粳重訂新限價　門市價格十六萬八千元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長於昨晨再度召集米業代表談話，重訂新限價。規定今日起白粳門市價格不得過十六萬八千，市塲交易價不得過十六萬。如有違越嚴懲不貸。據悉政府訂購之西貢米共約十七萬噸，其中一部份即可於日內抵滬。數約二萬噸，由中信局撥歸市府專以調節滬市民食之用。當局對抑平本市米價，具有充份信心。</p>
<p>昨南北兩市塲到貨幾吿絕跡，共祗二百九十五石。社局仍拋出食米九千包。自配米提貨手續簡化後，昨今兩日米倉出貨每日已達一萬二千包。</p>
<p>麵粉貨稀銷活，挺升千餘元。鈇皮交易甚濃，步砌二三千元。豆餅續加千餘元。黄豆供求兩旺，東北到源已抵萬包，價形漲定之格。蒃豆南洋猛吸，高貨　續上升二三千元，中次平正。蠶豆奇貨可居，飛跳一二萬元。赤豆華南搜購　聯，節節上漲，再加六七千元。紅糧來去兩稀，並無榮辱，芝蔴生仁洋莊納胃仍殷，按步挺進，續漲三五千元。</p>
<h3>食油騰漲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕食油市價，昨日　續騰漲，豆油已叩五十一萬元新高價，簍生油四十八萬八千元，吉普桶生油五十三萬五千元，無錫豆油五十五萬元。榨油原料方面，市價走勢堅挺。黄豆每担十五萬九千元，漢口，乍豆十四萬元，歸德生仁每老祖廿六萬元九千元。</p>
<p>業中人分析日來油價連續勝漲原因：（一）過去我國對外輸出食油及原料所簽訂合約，數額頗爲廳大，近來陸續起運出口。（二）近日來黑市外匯暴漲，榨油原料走私出口之風亦隨以俱熾。（三）各廠產油，以受議價所制，而原料日漲，生產量遂日告痿縮。（四）傳後勤部近來在蚌埠，漢口，徐州等地收購黄豆，對原料供　，頗有影響云。</p>
<h3>人絲喊價又升</h3>
<p>人造絲市昨又上升，一二〇號高山有光開盤喊價一百九十萬元後，人心異常振奮，冉冉高升，迄午收盤價爲二百卅萬元。午後復做，喊價到三百萬元，週一期票，結果比上日又大起一百萬元。七五號金雞半光喊價亦帶起一百萬元，但並無成交。廠經交易甚稀，昨喊價一致提升，各檔均大六七十萬元之譜。昨只有高零祖係D字等級五担顯拆貨。價做做一千五百萬元，餘乏成交。綢貨因原料高漲，被面喊價俱高二三十萬元，然無成交。大誠格子璧縐二萬六千二百元，開盤即有成交，後又上升至四百元做開，雖不乏乘高拋售，喊價仍繼續提升，卒做六千七百元收盤，週一期票做開七千元，即期價比上日漲一千元之譜。</p>
<h3>棉布市况穩定</h3>
<p>昨日紡建公司照例開售各種布疋，限價政策已經改變，將採取彈性管理，致市塲交易重行熱鬧。白坯開出二種，藍鶴細布限於染織業，價爲二十一萬八千元，另有二十支特細布掛價，仍爲十五萬九千元，同業挨號配給，而場內做開龍頭細布二十五萬五千元，五福二十四萬五千元，二十支特細布二十萬元，籃雞二十四萬，其餘色布士林布仍鮮變更。四君子嗶幾初開二十二萬四千元，散戶見低進補，價即步升至廿二萬八千元。</p>
<h3>買方形勢優越　華股漲風又起</h3>
<p>華股昨再邁進，惟漲勢純受雜牌及新股之推動，是以較爲緩和。紗布帮之游資，仍在陸續滲入，積面帮不得不在臨收有補。北帮新買參加，錢兌帮及少壯派之少數供給，仍難轉變供過於求之環境。晨開見高，景綸因開價過賤，續吿漲停。開後遞永紗經一二號六五號二二四號一一七號一五四號八三號二一七號之買進，內衣由九七號，火柴由二二四號等，首先掛停，漲到四八四〇元。九七號二二三號一四號一八三號一二五號逢高賣出，降爲四七六〇元。一〇六號一八五號二二四號九四號八九號一四五號再進，統益榮豐五和華豐新亞紛紛掛停，乃盤漲到四九〇〇元。九福亦吿漲停，一四號一五三號四八號四號八三號脫手，降至四八三〇元。商務又吿漲停，一〇五號二三一號一〇七號一六〇號一四二號一五三號二二三號八九號一五三號一一七號九四號紛來買進，近午乃漲高到四九八〇元新高價。二一八號一三七號八九號一九七號尙有供給，回挫至四八五〇元。七六號五六號尙加維持，散戶急補，午收再將遞永紗抬高至四九二〇元結束。收後平疲，結果較前收計華豐漲停，中法新華美亞永公各升一成，信和永紗漲半成强，景福升半成弱，新光升而不多。遲交計永紗信和美亞各升半成光景，永公升一成，華豐漲停，冷股計中法商務中紡統益榮豐火柴景綸五和九福新亞內衣均吿漲達限度，國貨大通水泥各升一成光景，中絲僅吿微升，塲外各股漲勢更爲有力。</p>
<h3>統債成交稀少</h3>
<p>公廣昨平穩逾恒，五一二室三六〇室有納，五五六室則售。統丙晨開一四二〇〇元，高價一四六〇〇元，低價一三六〇〇元，最後仍在一四〇〇〇元外掙扎。結果較前收各價均吿回落二百元，成交不過二三百萬元。</p>
<h3>外股初平後俏</h3>
<p>外股昨初平後俏，紗布游炎有所活動，北幫新買見股，廣幫亦納，散戶咸有了結，良以港匯十分穩定也。報載港地註册之訊，在在予買方鼓勵。怡紗晨開五四五〇〇元，自五四三〇〇扳高至五七五〇〇元而後稍平，小型股較爲活躍。結果較前收計業廣紙業怡啤各漲一成半左右，餘股均升半成迄一成弱。</p>
<h3>全國錢商業公會　首次籌備會議</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕本市錢商業同業公會，昨日議定本月份之往來久息爲一角三分，往來存息爲一分八。按往來欠息，月初掛一角三分半，後减低爲一角二分，故本月份議定之一角三分，係將全月掛牌利率平均統計而得。至往來欠息以外之定期及貼現等放款利率，則仍爲一角二分。聞該項利率業已徽得銀行業同業公會之同意云，</p>
<h3>麵粉廠代表臚陳困難　吳市長允設法解決</h3>
<p>下月份配粉仍維持三十萬包　配價問題下週召開會議商決</p>
<p>本市福新車豐華中裕通茂新等五大麵粉廠，昨日聯合呈文吳市長，對仍以目前之限價親續供應下月份民需麵紛事，頗有困難，臚陳各點如下：（一）產地陳麥數量，所剩極微，新麥尙未登塲，本市每月配售本粉須小麥約八萬擔，目前可能預卜之收購量恐不足三分之一，與需要量相差甚鉅。（二）運輸阻碍甚多，若干地區如蘇北及漢口等地已購得之小麥，由於當地情况不靖或運輸機構缺乏與當地禁止出口等原因，未能裝運來滬。（三）收購價製磨本粉成本與配售相較，每包差額達四萬元之鉅，即使中信局有利朗粉配出貼補虧賠，亦不數遠甚。各廠以上述三點，推派代表向吳市長陳述後，當經吳市長面允於月內設法解決。下月份配售問題，由中信局增添配額，以補本粉云足之數。成本與配價間之　賠，下週間召集有關各方商議，謀取合理解決。下月份配額決維持三十萬包，不予减少云。</p>

<h3>國藥成交不多</h3>
<p>國藥市况，洋廣幫價格向上，人心緊張，搜購不易。木香喊四萬元現鈔，白川呌一萬六千元，成交雖有，然亦小數。原油茴呌一千六百元，北山杏喊高六千元，缺乏成交，外埠來客頗惑燙手，本埠添配意成觀望。</p>
<h3>外銷茶交易旺</h3>
<p>溫州新旗槍昨因育島幫去化仍可，人心見挺，行情亦吿軋升。其他花色咸祗零星走銷，過程缺少變化。至於洋莊茶市，汪裕泰注視之去年度三幫中祁門，交易依然不弱，而市勢猶極平疲。茲悉：午昌茶葉公司對於卅五年度平水大幫頗有悅胃吸收，同時陳抽珍怡和洋行需要亦佳，刻下均在與貨主磋商中。如能順利解決，奄奄一息之洋莊茶市，無異獲得一帖興奮劑，從此當能逐步復　矣。</p>
<h3>信用證申請展期　應送輸管會審核</h3>

<h3>五金實銷呆滯</h3>
<p>五金商情本週較上週約漲二成强，今日市價稍平靜，惟昆蟲牌綠絲布售價仍驚人，然而各種貨品實銷呆滯，羊肝漆價格亦上昇。</p>
<h3>買戶見低吸收　紗價重趨高昂</h3>
<p>昨日紗市因當局限令各紗號出售存紗，限價取銷，准許自由賣買，塲內恢復交易，成交一百三十餘包。行情因上日跌落過多，染織廠見低吸收，本街實銷活躍，人心堅挺。四十二支藍鳳喊高至一千二百三十萬，二十支　雙馬六百萬元，比之上日回升自二十萬至八十萬元。</p>

<p>木材俏俐</p>
<p>杉木上漲甚烈，洋松亦追隨於後，昨各檔木材市氣大盛。</p>
<h3>運輸問題解決　川鄂桐油可到</h3>
<p>桐油鈑以國外市價疲弱，出口商已感困難，蓋國外市價之疲弱，仍爲我成本過高，而成本過高之關鍵，則在運輸問題未得合理解決。輸出會方面，正積極設法協助中。據悉：最近正屆洪水時期，該會特與重慶船舶調配委員會交涉，請求多配噸位，聞已得同意。預計三個月內，四川，湖甫，兩地洞油，可運三萬噸來滬。運輸問題已吿解決，桐油成本，可望减輕。至與國外市價相衡，桐油今後，當可源源出口。</p>
<h3>秘魯糖到滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前China　toaster號抵滬，由秘魯運來食糖四萬包，停泊招商局中棧起卸，昨日移泊二十二·二十三號浮筒過駁。</p>
<p>又海康輪昨由奏皇島抵滬，運來大豆一千九百十噸，火磚四百八十二件，現泊金利源碼頭起卸。</p>
<h3>小麥供應問題</h3>
<p>目前各粉廠所最感棘手者，爲小麥之供應問題。以來價言，楊州小麥抵滬價，每祖合十萬零五千元。無錫小麥抵滬價，每担合十一萬五千元。設按小麥每祖十一萬元計算，產粉每袋成本，須扯七萬六千元。再以小麥品質言，近來因百物騰漲，摻雜之風日烈。往往每担含雜質八斤至廿斤不等，無形又增加生產成本。</p>
<p>據某粉業鉅子估計：本年蘇皖兩省，大致可收小麥六百萬担。同時希望國外轍入洋麥四百萬担，總計一千萬担小麥，則本年度滬市麵粉產量，可達一千七百萬袋。此數已勉可供應華東華北各區麵粉之消費量。惟此數與戰前相較，已屬不堪回首。蓋戰前單以蘇北一帶之小麥產量言，年可達四千萬担以上。麵粉產量單上海一地，年達三千萬袋以上云</p>
<h3>四行兩局一庫　修正各地滙率</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕四行兩局一庫匯往各地匯款匯率，自廿八日起，將略有修正。慶門每千元四五元，（原爲三十元），福州四〇元（原爲三十五元），福建區其他各地四五元（原爲三十五元）。徐州八元（原爲五元）。南通八元（原爲六元）。蚌埠十元（原爲八元）。安徽區除蕪湖，蚌埠，屯溪，歙縣外，其他各地十五元（原爲十二元）。贛州十元（原爲五元），九江十元（原爲八元）。浙江區除杭州，嘉興，溫州，寗波，紹興，湖州，海門，臨海外，其他各地二十元（原爲十五元）。敘府十元（原爲十五元），四川區除重慶，成都，敘府，方縣外，其他各地十元（原爲五元）。雲南區五元（原爲二元）。</p>
<p>其他各重要地點，匯率仍照舊不變。廣州七五元，汕頭人〇元，長沙，衡陽均五五元，漢口，武昌均五〇元，沙市宜昌均五五元，平津，杭州，重慶均二元，成都五元。</p>
<p>商業行莊方面匯率，廣州自一二〇元至一七〇元，汕頭一，五〇元，漢口七〇至八〇元，長沙六〇至八〇元，匯率仍屬昂貴。</p>
<p>國行方面人士表示：國家行局兩週來對粵汕漢口長沙等地匯率，始終維持不變，所以望平穩商業行莊之匯率。且商業行莊如確因生產商採購原料，需要匯款，果能敘述充份理由，提供證件，則國家行局對該項鉅額款項之調撥，無不樂予便利。矧對商業行莊託匯之率，尙有按規定匯率，予以七折至九折之優待。商業行莊已有合法利潤，深望勿再提高匯率，以安匯市。同時，聞國行內匯部主管，刻正與該行發行局洽商妥善辦法，設法抑平高昂之匯率云。</p>

<h3>法國議會　旁聽記</h3>
<p>— 建華</p>
<p>巴黎十五日航訊</p>
<p>越南問題掀起軒然大波　法國閣潮由動亂到平息</p>
<p>越南事件自去年十一月十九日由海防煤油案肇了端後，戰事漫延到河內，旋而南圻北圻都變成了戰塲；但是兩方面誰也不宣戰，一如我國廬溝橋事變後的情形一樣。法國一任當地駐軍自由擺佈二任當地官方通訊社獨向法國報導，其所傳達的消息似乎並未沾着事實，他宣傳海防問題是由於華方運私小船被法方盤査，越方不査究竟，向之砲轟而起，河內的戰爭是越方有計劃的佈置，在十二月十八日晚六時收到越方議續談判的覆文後，次日晚八時便全城燈熄槍聲四起，把頭兩天（十七日）法兵進攻越南政府及總統府官邸，經激烈的巷戰而佔領，胡志明隻身逃脫，黄銘鑑身受重傷諸節，却輕輕地删銷了，這段情况，巴黎至今被　在鼓裘，至於華僑屍首纍纍更是一字未提，只說華僑深受法方保護，財物無缺，中國政府並再三拜托法方照顧，以證法方威力之大，這段苦情只有越南的華僑自已知這。</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>戰事至今糊裏糊塗過了四個月了，法國議會一再宕延，眼開着預定的軍費用到三月底便將吿罄，以後的軍費籌揹，須經議會的通過不可，於是不得不在本月十一日開始討論，決定法國對越南的政策。那想到這番討論，從越南問題扯到黨派問題，扯到人事問題，扯到抗德與通德問題，扯到蘇俄，扯到政府組織，扯到國防部的權限，弄得議長與內閣總經搿了面子，一位被德判過死刑的女議員敬了媚敵置產的男議員臉上左右兩個耳光，民衆共和黨的黨魁殊曼與一個社會急進黨的議員在會塲中，因爲議笑之故，也被此拗成一團，抓着領帶不放，至於討論時停會之多，及退席之履，更是不在話下，這是法國議會有史以來很少見的紊亂狀態，連議長自己都說：有時理智壓不住情感。幸而議長還是一個老手赫理歐先生，鎭壓得住全塲，從十一日起，討論了六塲共十日，幸尙能開成會，若換爲另一個人，不知更糟到什麼地步了。茲詳敘大會實况如左：</p>
<p>十一日下午三時大會開場，議員咸集，來賓席及新聞記者席更是水洩不通，空氣十分緊張，大家屛氣無聲。赫理歐高據主席台上，海外部長慕德率同他的僚屬珊德尼Sainteny等五人靜座在台下最前一排。最先登台發言的是最右派的共和自由黨黨員拉麻婁尼，他說「我們法國在安南八十年來修了三萬二千公里的大道，三千多公里的鐵路，開墾了二百多萬頃田地，足見越南需要我們的經騐，科學與創造的才能，這個國家處於內憂外患，將來不找法國來保護還找誰呢？也只有法國能導越南各民族走向自由，趨於道義……那知那邊少數份子，甘冒不諱，强動干戈。所以應採强硬手段對待那般有意驅逐法僑出境的反叛，兼用柔和政策對待人民，而維護法國在遠東的實利，一切妥協，遲疑的態度不應再有了。」說完，靜悄悄地走下台來。　繼而登台的，是共和自由黨的另一黨員都崩，他希望殖民部長「絕不放棄越南」的諾言能實現」，因爲只有法國能在越南維護自由與文化，維明不是越南。說完換了同黨的昂得勒上台，接着發揮右派的政見。他却離了越南問題，先來一個資問，「爲什麽國防部交在一個共黨的人主持？表面上它雖像有名無實的閣席，充數而已，只在計劃國防中的軍需衛生及住宿的問題；實際上，凡有關軍事命令須由他副署才生效，現在輪到越南事件擴大，弄得處處掣肘；再說共黨一向反對軍備，希特勒未上台之前，陶萊士曾到過柏林，在一九三三年一月十五日對德國工友講演，反對進占魯爾，沙爾，反對向德國索賠款，反對凡爾塞條約，主張一切被壓迫的殖民地完全獨立，反對一切軍費預算，及拉瓦勒兩年後（一九三五年）與史太林在莫斯科簽了字，共黨便改了面容：接受有關國防的軍費預算，變爲反抗希特勒德國最激烈的份子；每於開會時，未唱國際歌之前，先唱馬賽曲了。及至第二次大戰將發，德俄訂立了一九三九年八月二十三日的互不侵犯條約，共黨聯名上書下議院議長赫理歐，請立刻與德國簽訂和善條約；當時有一位共黨黨員拉虛埃特上書內閣總理請求入伍，遞補逃跑的共黨首領之缺額……。」話剛說到這裏，共黨領袖現任副內閣總理的陶萊士正坐在對面，站起來，說：「不對，並未曾逃，我堅守共黨總秘書的職務，關於這點，你若願意的話，我立刻給你一個解釋！」說畢，左邊議席熟烈鼓掌，共黨議員們更站起來鼓掌，良久。（詳見法國政府公報八〇七頁第一行）另外一位議員站起來說：「昂得勒先生，　　您若有勇氣，也應把陶萊士指揮共黨攻撃占領的德軍實况，述出來才對！」議長赫理歐站起來說：「昂特勒先生，我竭力維護你的發言自由，但是別講到今天的議題以外，在這全國一致的時候，不應搖動，分化，若再接着這樣講，我勢必宣吿休會，請您把結論講完了罷！」這時會塲鬧得喧囂不已，赫理歐看着無法接下去，乃宣吿休會，時正午後六時四十分</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>七時五分，赫理歐重步上主席台，宣吿續開。在未織續討論之前，他說：「方才的衝突，實在有背議塲的聲譽，昂得勒先生語出顯外，有違議會章程第四十三條，現請他注意下列兩點：一，昂得勒過慣了舊日政黨鬥爭惡習，而忘了全國一致解放國家的新精神，實在有凟各黨各派爲國捐軀的英靈；二，昂得勒辱及政府大員，副內閣總理，而忘了漫駡是法國議會一向禁止的，這實予全國民衆一個壞印象，何况陶萊士歷任政府要職，不自今日始，最初是由愛護國家利益最著的戴高樂將軍延請入閣的。昂得勒先生，我予你三分鐘，把結論講完」。內閣總理拉馬傑站起來附和議長的意見，並說：粗魯的打駡在議會的討論裏是絕對禁止的，因爲這樣將被法國人民及全世界所輕視，…」話猶未了，只聽有人呌：「過道」裏打了人了！原來有位被德軍判過死刑囚在集中營的共黨女議員意妞蘭夫人，聽到辱及共黨秘書長之後，一聲不響，走出來，候昂得勒出塲的時候，照着他的左右兩頰，打了兩個巴掌。</p>
<p>大家這時那里曉得塲外的交手戰，內閣總理仍在說：「現在大家應當忘了過去，團結起來，共負建國的責任，有時咸不及過去的英烈，但是比過去更困難，更需時，其所需的勇氣不減於戰時，把方才的小衝突忘了罷，因爲侮及敵黨”實即侵及民衆。」</p>
<p>話猶未畢，又一議員搶着發言，赫理歐允許了他，只聰道：「諸位曉得昂得勒是誰？原來就是德國占領期問消遙於德國併吞的昂西城中，願服從法國法律及德國軍律意國購置封鎖的猶太人房屋的一位專家，」說畢，把昂得勒與管理昂西猶太財產主任斯投勒的一封信，當衆宣讀了一遍。證明昂得勒是位利用希特勒罪孽的取巧者，那可容其登台演說！赫理歐又站起來，吿戒大家，今日這塲雄辯關於安南至關重要，不僅全國民衆翹望，外國人也在覬覦，聯合國大會也生反響，望大家沉靜些，昂得勒願犧牲他的未竟講詞最好。」昂得勒未依，赫理歐悻悻地說：「好罷，但不得離題！」</p>
<p>昂得勒再度走上台去，即苦訴道：「剛才走出會塲的時候，不幸被人拳打脚踢，講稿丟了一地，被人踩來踩去…」左邊的議員聽了，笑不可仰。一個說：「打你的是個女人，」另一個說：「是被囚在集中營的」，另一個說：「被德人曾判過死刑！」昂得勒道：請大家評判，我說出了題外沒有？」說得哄堂大笑，他自辯道，「我也被德人抓起來過，關在獄裏…」這時全塲吵得一塌糊塗，無法繼續赫理歐宣佈散會，十三日再繼續討論，時已晚七時三十五分。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>十三日下午三時，國民大會復行集會，討論越南問題。赫理歐先申言：「前日的交手衝突是絕對要不得的，將由負責委員會詳定裁制辦法，以補會章第四十三條的缺漏。如果代表中任何人被侮及時，只有議長來制止，別人不得濫用手段，以維護法國自由的眞面目，」說完，面向右轉，問道「昂得勒先生若發表對越南的意見，可以上台發言，若是通盤的政治問題，則定日另行討論。」昂得勒應允道次準講越南問題，上台後把法國政府內部不一致及尙容忍越南政府的代表常川駐在巴黎的錯誤，講了一遜，才下台。</p>
<p>這時，換了另一黨上台演說，他是左翼聯盟的德維那，巴故越南總督洼賴那的信徒，他首將越南的重要述了一遍，比如：「法國的主權所在，三萬法僑的安全，五十年來所護利益的保持，二千五百萬不同種族不同語言不同宗敎不同習俗的土人的繁榮與秩序的維繫，少數份子受了中西薰陶而要求獨立，以致到處是災荒與恐怖，城鄉蹂躪，損失已達五千萬萬之鉅，成千的法僑死亡，成萬的土人失跡，到處與中國一樣，鄉農田爐成墟，乃挺而走險，以致戰爭釀成兇年，兇年更加深戰爭。目前，首應辨別「越南」與「越盟」是兩回事：越南是一個地域名稱，包括自河內至西貢一帶地方位在媚公河以東的三圻；越盟是一個政治名詞，（即「越南獨立同盟」的縮稱，記者註。）具有國家思想的革命組織，產生於上次大戰之後，由胡志明創始。胡氏全家被法國人殺戳後，隻身逃至香港，時年二十五歲，充任俄領事的私人秘書爲生，一九三〇年曾一度返越，後入中國；旋來歐洲，住巴黎數年，受了革命思想很深，聯絡各殖民地的志士於一起，參加過莫斯科的國際農民大會，在那里計劃過安南革命靑年黨以剷除法國勢力，恢復越南獨立爲宗旨。在香港曾一度被英人拘禁，旋被釋放。當前年三月九日，日軍驅逐法國人後，擬造一傀儡帝國未成，至八月投降。胡志明在同月二十日在河內總督署宣佈越南獨立，講辭如左：</p>
<p>「八十年來，法國殖民階級人物，執着自由平等博愛的三色旗，强占我們的土地，摧殘我們的民族，違背正義與人道。在政治方面，這般法國人不予我們一點自由，强立野蠻法制，因地制宜，阻止我們民族的統一，大興監獄，其數目遠在所建學校之上，打盡一般愛國愛民的志士，淹死在血泊中，箝制輿論，施行黑暗政治，用大烟及酒銷沉我們民族。積於以上諸因，我們鄭重向全世界宣佈越南民族自今享有自由與獨立之權。」（原文見今年法政府公報第八二七頁。）在道合理的聲明之下，法國派軍前往，代表珊得尼往來於昆明河內及中國駐軍之間，磋訂了去年三月六日的協定，先是慕德先生於二月廿八日獲得了中國撤軍的許可，我在此謹向海外部長表示賀意，繼有」萬五千法軍於三月五日到達海防。自三月至十二月，法國政策在巴黎與西貢兩技，遑論人事！遂造成了三錯，一錯在不善宣傳，二錯在行政腐化，三錯在政治含混。補救之道：先以兵力恢復秩序；，再佔領越南的重要點，如城市，碼頭，倉庫，礦區，及各原料產地；改派精明的幹才前往，淘汰庸員；，恢復地方的糜爛。現在尙不算晚，否則，越南脫離了法國，其他各海外領地皆保不住了。」　講畢下來，換了被德軍打敗的前國務總理萊惱上台，激起了會塲空前左右紛爭，越南駐法代表陽白梅爲其攻擊的唯一目標。</p>

<h3>都江堰　放水盛典</h3>
<p>— 本報駐蓉記者周學端</p>
<p>成都十一日航訊</p>
<p>都江堰在四川灌縣，西距成都百餘里，工程始於戰國秦昭玉時，創建者爲蜀守李冰，距今已二千餘年。五日晨記者搭水利局專車由蓉出發，朝曦初上，爽氣撲人，成灌道上爲川西平原精華所在，彌望平疇一片，大似江南，夾道綠樹，著處成陰。途經三酒憶郫筒不用沽」的郫縣，十時即抵灌縣。灌縣是川西一大城市，川康主要貿易的藥材茶葉即以此爲集散地。倚山築城，形勢雄險，遠望雲峯際天，靑翠滿目，左爲靈岩，右即道敎有名的勝塲靑城山。灌縣在歷史上以楊貴妃故鄉得名，至今尙有楊妃遺跡的棲鳳窩與歡鳳樓。</p>
<p>都江堰開水是四川一年一度的大典。考都江堰工程，在秦昭王時，李冰守蜀，當時洪水氾濫，冰及其子二郞相度水勢，便在萬山之下的灌縣地方，由岷江中流，鑿開離堆，分散水勢爲內外二江，並設都江堰以操縱水力，引水灌溉成都平原，變水患爲水利</p>
<p>伏　觀　觀祭</p>
<p>車抵城內離堆公園，首先到伏龍觀觀祭李太守禮。觀在離堆上，下爲寳瓶口，俗傳李冰治水伏龍於此，又稱用主廟，倚山建築，巍峨壯麗。前殿祀李太守，後殿爲觀瀾亭，登亭可俯瞰寳瓶家鼻諸口。憑欄眺江，洪流滾滾，波濤汹湧，整個都江堰盡入眼底，其下激湍澎湃，有如萬馬奔騰，形勢極爲壯偉，祀典由川省主席鄧錫侯主祭，各廳長陪祭，用三牲太牢，焚燭拈香，鳴鐵砲，讀祭文，行最敬禮，儀式肅穆隆重。</p>
<p>祀李太守後，即出觀經人字隄，里許至二王廟，廟傍杜少陵：「玉疊浮雲變古今」的玉壘山修築，雄峙半山，飛閣危樓，遙與伏龍觀重簷複棟相對峙，傅建自北齐建武時，俗稱顯英王廟。拾級登廟，入門即見李氏父子治水六字訣：「深淗灘，低作堰」，與八字眞言：「遇灣截角，逢正抽心」：這是二千年來治水的圭臬，也是最科學的治水方法。更上爲正殿，塑二王像，被錦袍，廟祝謂係乾隆所賜，廟後附祀淸治水有功之丁文誠（寳楨）像，祭典仍由鄧代主席主持，儀式與祀老王同。</p>
<p>雲消霧散戈　開放</p>
<p>李太守與二郞祀典畢後，即正式開堰。都江堰工程，上下綿延，長約四里，分（一）百丈隄及挑水壩：在最上遊，目的在護岸及逼使洪水流入正道。（二）都江魚嘴，即都江主堰，在安瀾索橋下，設魚嘴分內外兩江，外江爲岷江正流，內江引外江之水，成三大幹流西走成都平原。（三）榪槎：在魚嘴上，即引外江水道之閘門，爲調節水量的主要物，榪槎係木製的三足架，由若千三足架迎接成排，內裝卵石，外實泥沙，作爲引水閘及擋水壩。（四）平水槽：在魚嘴下，內江水量過多，則用以餘洩水。（五）飛沙堰；內江水引入水道，流至玉壘關，水流轉向，設此堰以逼水入寳瓶口，若內江水量過高，即由此回流外江。（六）寳瓶口：爲工程最末段，鑿山而成，嚴上刻有水則，所以記內江水量，自四畫至廿二畫，水面逾十一盡，川西平原用水即足，低則不足，過則有餘，岩上即伏龍觀。</p>
<p>都江堰中心工程是魚嘴及　槎，魚嘴分岷江爲二，平時外江水流浩蕩，河床亦高，於是設備槎以隔斷兩江。內江不需水時，即樹榪槎以阻外江之水，內江需水，則拆去部份榪槎，外江之水即流入內江。開水即成都平原需要春水，正式拆去榪槎，使外江水量流入內江之意。榪槎總數，外江約五十洞（一三角架爲一洞），內江約七十洞，祝內江需要之水量，定拆榪槎之多寡。</p>
<p>開水儀式，在主祭官拈香敬神，鳴鐵砲後，即由數十力頭陸續拉倒榪槎（今年共拆二十四洞），外江洪水即奔流而下，俄傾之間，淺僅沒膝的內江即成爲波濤奔騰的浩瀚巨流，開水典禮，即吿全部完成。</p>
<p>成灌道　熱鬧</p>
<p>開水典禮是四川一年一度最隆重的大典，我這類似戲劇性的儀式中，寓着數千萬人民的最高崇敬心情，每次盛典　例必需四川最高行政負責人親自主持，今年在省府並未擴大舉行下，四方來觀禮的最低統計也在十五萬人以上。堰流所及，受益田畝約計六百餘萬畝。川西繁榮，實所利賴。</p>
<p>典禮完成，遊罷都江全堰，在暮　蒼茫中搭原車歸來。沿途見成灌道上，風馳電掣，絡繹不絕的百餘輛觀禮專車，載着十餘萬滿懷景仰心情的觀衆倦遊歸來，這正象徴李冰父子和其手創的都江堰水利工程的無比偉大。</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>飛絮</h3>
<p>— 魯莽</p>
<p>春，似乎才來了不久，卻又輕輕地走了！</p>
<p>病中，困居在小屋子裏，不明白春的消息，覺得天氣暖暖地，人意又懶洋洋，春應該正　。窗外有　亂的驚聲，　角又掛着嬌綠的樹枝，春的跡象一絲沒有走漏。可是忽然從窗外飛進一種東西來，前前後後，高高低低，是那麽輕飄，那麽柔　；像一種毛羽，像一種棉絮，一時眞的想不起這是什麽？</p>
<p>而且令人難以捉摸，她又不着邊際，這是什麼呵！寂寞的斗室中闖入了這些輕狂而微細的小東西？</p>
<p>哦，這是楊花，這是柳絮，吿訴我「春」已經走了。她們有無限的密意，怕我不知道「春」已經走了，所以這樣的纏繞我，輕輕地，款款地，報吿這段令人惆悵的消息。我一面惶恐，一面感，因爲她們用這樣溫柔較徵的方式，報吿這個不願聽的消息。</p>
<p>打開窗戶，向園子裏細細一瞧，『春』果然走了！你看，多少的樹不已經『綠葉成蔭子滿枝』。怪我幾天不出門，消息太隔膜了。再看看空中，那些像羽毛像棉絮的東西，正瀰漫着，在上下飛舞。她們劃分了季節，但也帶來了惆悵。</p>
<p>我看見柳條兒吐出『綠意』不久，我看見柳條兒蕩漾春情不久，忽然她們又送出春走的信號，如何地令人驚異春在人間的短促呵！我眞要像占詩人一樣，喊一聲我要趕到天涯，趕上春，和春小住。</p>
<h3>僞秦瓦漢甎室譚印</h3>
<p>— 李白鳳</p>
<p>求眞與審美</p>
<p>自希臘哲人蘇格拉底示吾人藝術必追求「眞」，「善」，「美」三大原則後，數千年仍爲藝人之標的；印學雖以我國獨善其道，然亦應以此國際尺度做衡量標準也。</p>
<p>文字學於印事之影響至鉅，故印人若欲廢棄文字學之根基，將無法開拓其治印之疆界；劉鶚羅振玉輩之殷契問世後，文字學本身已創一新紀元，容庚·商承祚·郭沫若·董作賓諸氏，已起用甲骨設印許叔重說文之謬誤，如「爲」，「鬥」……似較徒以金文是賴者，得一長足進步矣，（此點予另有「許叔重說文解字詮釋」一書詳爲訂正。）</p>
<p>昔白石早歲，即以印知名，然此公不依據文字學而意創者甚衆，晚年曾力蒐舊製，不使存世，僅此一例即知印人不可恃才孤行也。現存白崇禧先生一印，即白石手刋，其「白」字作「　」，蓋以白字筆劃過簡，爲之增飾，故失其文字學依據，僅此一筆，便謂失眞矣。</p>
<p>予非以此詬汚白石老人，實欲引證以鑑諸來者。</p>
<p>習見印人，泰半依恃於「六書通」一書，一若鄉愚之憑恃「通書」者，此誠問道於盲，危殆殊甚；蓋「六書通」一書，傳印甚夥，謬誤叢出，且易鐘鼎與李篆同刋，行不由徑，易陷大謬。</p>
<p>印人應備「段玉裁註許愼說　」，「吳大瀓說文古箍補」，「佛言說文古箍補補」，「漢印分讀」，「古箍彙編」，「稜古齋阮氏鐘鼎彝器款識」，「馮云鵬昆仲金石索」……諸書逐一參考，再參以劉戴雲之「鐵雲藏龜」羅振玉之「殷虛書契精華」等契文研究，使諸體備識，然後落刃，始無大班矣。</p>
<p>治印一道，文三橋輩並未若今日之重視「美」與「眞」，故三橋輩惟徒師秦漢而矣，奚足道哉！予非衛道之士，故不懼世俗相議，而爲一公開之露佈也。</p>
<p>若不越乎「守眞」一，斯可與議「審美」矣。</p>
<p>漢印端方平正，未嘗計及印面之美，故千篇一律，因陳舊章，毫無變化，吾人因之，斯乃刻舟之愚也？漢印之美，端在「樸實庫厚」，其餘了無可言。然至淸季，趙撝叔輩以織柔見稱，別開新局，後之來者，便顯無力，而成媚俗，自無可取。</p>
<p>撝叔要完白山人之「江流有聲，臨岸千尺一，一印之風俗，而獨樹一　·淵源有目·堪稱大家；完白此印與趙松雪之「松雪齋」一印源出一格，自覺脫俗，已較丁何輩注重格局，此印大氣磅　，如天馬行空，不可窮其迹象，一學便愚，至撝叔一　，後人效之，早成弩末矣。</p>
<p>與爲叔分庭者，首稱蒼老，被以大刀闊斧，巧匠錦心，故能得心應手，玩字粒於指掌之間，斯俱由於蒼老工於書畫，而以書畫相參入印，分行佈白，全部美化；其「老缶」，「俊」，「俊卿」諸印，實天衣無縫，望之袖手。尤以「破荷亭」一印，以粗·壯·拙三點開印學豪宕之門。其邊錢取乎殘碑斷碣，得其神體，白龍山人及白石山人皆其餘脈也。</p>
<p>至若白石老人，尙不失其天眞純樸之豪邁作風，惟略覺放宕，不及蒼老含蓄，白石恣放，易陷粗曠，劍拔弩張，便易喪神，流風所被，神氣蕩然。</p>
<p>近人楊仲子壽石公，頗能力正前謬，余嘗見仲子一印文曰：「江南楊仲子」雖覺工力稍遜，仍渾厚雅重，而壽石公之「木居士」一印，能存漢印風緻而自見一格，堪稱名手。</p>
<p>予束髮就學，茅塞未開，每見流俗邊跋，喜作細字，亦思效顰，曾爲師友力斥其非，蓋細字用錐，本不足以觀刀斧，後遂棄如敝　；十年流徙，市　猶有重於此道者，故略爲提示，以警後學。</p>
<p>邊跋須以能見刀法，斯爲上選，藏芒　拙，均爲小道，可不愼哉！</p>
<h3>從吳缶盧說到王個簃</h3>
<p>— 鄭午昌</p>
<p>淸季民初，以花卉畫獨樹　塲爲時大家者，則安吉吳先生缶盧也。缶廬好吟詠，精篆刻，善書石鼓文，皆雄奇古茂，功力掌魄，不可一世。自言五十始能畫。其畫一如其詩，書，篆刻。蓋其作畫，非即作畫也；乃以其所得於詩，書，篆刻之意境筆法氣趣，用之於盡，而以磅礴之氣　使之，故能雄奇古茂如此。觀缶廬之畫，而　其詩，審其書，摩其篆刻，理法無別，神氣一貫。學缶廬之詩之書之篆刻，或能得其儸長；欲學其畫，則非兼擅其詩，害，篆刻不可。學者不察，以其粗筆重色，狂率而易之，靡然相效；於是有其軀壳，而面目全非，似其面目，而神氣盡失，畫虎類犬，吳派畫，遂爲時所姤病。老友王君个簃，師事缶　最久且敬，平夕隨侍左右，於缶盧詩，書，篆刻，得其眞傳。故其畫，構圖落筆運意取勢，一如缶廬法。　會訪缶　，缶　默默倚枕若有所思；旋起凝視桌上所布素紙；稍復還坐榻沿，頻頻點首，即奮臂而起，潑　縱筆，如風兩至，龍蛇走，頃刻間，盛榮藤六尺屛一幩。笑曰：「余以氣寫，非用筆也」。以氣寫意，實爲缶盧作畫妙訣。个簃每有所作，雖一花一葉，無不注精會神，運思畜氣於前；然後解衣磅磚，兎起鶻落，不滯不疑；潑　而惜墨如金，縱筆而力達筆尖，可謂盡得缶廬以氣寫意之能事矣。缶廬生前會以所用硯及技贈與个繇，固視个繇爲足傳其衣砵。个　亦能　師傳而加勉，十午以來，造諧益精。茲將陳其傑構都二百幀公諸衆覽，吾知讀者讀个　畫，當欣然知安吉之學，乃在海門。</p>
<h3>觀夢禪書刻</h3>
<p>— 𠳨翁</p>
<p>纔人會塲，就被一副五言隸書聯吸住了目光。那對句是：「禮樂中朝貴，文章大雅存」。絕似伊茶綬臨張遷，魄力之雄偉，令人驚絕。另一聯寫小篆，對句曰：「名畫要如詩句讀，古琴兼作水聲聽」頗有一種渾厚曼妙之味。</p>
<p>篆隸成就，旣已如此可觀，而夢禪自許者乃在其章草。於章草聯中曾見有「寳寐簃」三字，而印中又有「寐癖」二字，想其收藏沈寐叟甚多。故其章草書風格高邁，有神似「海日塵」者。不知亦識寐叟弟子王瑗仲敎授否？曩據王談，寐叟書可以穿五層夾宣，可見功力之深。</p>
<p>對聯中集宋詞集焦氏易林及集他人句者皆妥貼而富有風趣。集宋詞尤能天衣無縫，此事異翁亦優爲了。余愛其「赤壁泛舟，七月旣望。蘭亭修　暮春之初」。及「夜郞有才，不妨自大；匈奴未減，何以家爲」？二聯，有信手拈來皆成妙諦之慨。</p>
<p>最後談到他的印了。仿趙撝叔「爲五斗米抑腰」一印幾能亂眞。「海曲將軍章」可入「漢銅印叢」。引首章如「補蹉跎」「天行健」不獨刻得好，且有深意。而最妙者莫過於「江南第一妄人」，此印與白蕉之「天下第一懶人」可稱雙璧。實則復翁四不懶，而遲翁亦不妄也。</p>
<h3>歡樂</h3>
<p>— 沙蕾</p>
<p>沒有歡樂，也許是一個更大的歡樂吧。</p>
<p>時常，我這樣熱狂地奔赴歡樂，像是要付出全生命或全生涯似的。</p>
<p>但當我眞實地面臨歡樂之前，我却有着怎樣遼闊的寂寞啊！</p>
<p>在歡樂的不斷的取汲與掬飲中，我時常有加倍的焦渴。</p>
<p>我漸漸地聽不慣那些歡呼，大笑，雄辯，我感覺那些都是屬於噪音。</p>
<p>你看我那樣艱困地去赴一個盛宴，一次約會，我對於一襲太整潔的服裝也有很大的倦意。</p>
<p>你要我伴你去遨遊，去觀劇，去散步，我一定會應允的；可是你看出我一切的神色仍像是我們在小室裏對坐時嗎？我看到的永遠是你黑髮的輕披，沉默的幽微的飄行。</p>
<p>天國之宴一定也是像我們那樣的默默對坐吧，從一些碗碟裏，管絃樂器裏所盛滿所發出的一定是一些看不見聽不到的事物。</p>
<p>爲什麽我這樣喜歡你，我的友伴？因爲別的一些女性的名字都呌做「歡樂」，而你却是「孤獨」。</p>
<h3>个簃書畫展覽會</h3>
<p>— 潘伯鷹</p>
<p>文藝之事與世升降，蓋政事民力之所映發也。若就藝事一端而言，則其風氣轉移雖有必至之勢，然士夫君子之潛運其機當亦未可忽焉。吾土畫風自民國初元以後，漸人奔放之途。寒假而　疏者乃乘間以亂其流。甚者匠梓之倫，任筆爲體，亦竊高名而譁衆矣。故其風氣必變以入於謹肅，乃勢之所趨也。時至今日，則謹肅之境未易遽幾，而庸靡之弊已因之而起。試以上海一隅而言，四王吳惲之末流彌漫甚盛。其高者至文沈仇唐而止矣。夫四王吳惲文沈仇唐非不高也。而死於此諸家之下者，不惟爲法家之罪人，亦適足見其不善學耳。雖畫之爲體有山水人物島獸花卉之不同，而由筆墨畦徑以論其氣韻之高下其揆一也。然則破今日庸靡之弊，其道雖多，而以淋漓元氣掃其拘墟必居其一矣。金嘗謂吳倉石先生高風博學工詩善書，以其餘事爲畫爲刻石，其雄才古韵震耀一世，居上海又甚久，而藝事之能得其傳者甚稀。則學之者其人品不逮也，學不逮也，徒墓擬其迹無當也。於是羣以耳爲目之流，逐逐於若匠梓者之後，其與庸靡者之失蓋均之矣。去年余於回風堂公祭席上識王个簃先生。先生蓋倉石與回風二先生之高第也。間嘗至其高齋讀其詩畫，又觀其所藏吳先生之畫與書。而後識吳先生之法記有在。東坡詩云，一始知眞放本精微，不比狂花生客慧」。此破荷亭師弟子所爲火傳不絕相視而笑者歟！个簃先生今將出其書畫如千軸以諗上海眞賞之士。余以爲矯今日庸靡之弊，破流俗　疏之惑，以精微之放曠，尋人爲物外之眞遊，个簃於此誠有大功。願得知者與共論之也！</p>
<h3>挽覃理鳴</h3>
<p>— 章士釗</p>
<p>豪氣平生壓輩流，病猶吐論强扶頭；不甘示弱心逾細，無意凌人理却遒。求友每於朋黨外，特躬羞與孔方謀；卅年湖海收身去，肝膽看同日月浮。</p>
<p>好我眞如古急難，偶聞津譽爲心寬；照人不掩胸前月，接席頻翻舌本瀾。君子有文占豹變，相官無地作鯢桓；相知直欲同丁翼，敝帚從今洒淚看。</p>
<p>（自注二君病中吿余當爲余收拾文稿）</p>
<p>李茇棠言理嗚六十初度，歇馬塲院中同人乞文壽之，此事余寖忘矣，愧極而賦　章士釗</p>
<p>宿諾猶存歇馬塲，眼看吾友去堂堂？交情元自無言慣，文字都緣老病荒。此日寖門餘一哭，八年囊口與偕藏，可憐皮骨支離盡，畢竟登山勝在床。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　406</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>一共五個人，倒代表了四個不同的集團。五個人中，只有韓方代表和正岩二人，有這們一點點國籍上的差別；然而僅有正岩一人，在語言上有十分之一二的不舒暢。這是指着中國國語而說；他平日應用的語言，大部分是日語和上海話。</p>
<p>「首先大槪應當由兄弟把事情報吿一個大略」。鶴見操着純正的北平語，在這臨時圓桌會議上，開塲發言了。他聞頭就毫不保留地，說明了他同萍子到上海來的目的，「然而沒想到中村小姐，這一位主要的脚色，還不曾着手辦事，竟遭了人的暗算。……本來，時間這等急迫，統共只有這們一天多一點時間，還不知道應當做些什麽，怎樣做法，首先就碰到這棵的蹉跌，誰也沒有想到……本來預定一到四點鐘，預備拆開中村小姐那封文件來看，現在旣有各位仗義帮忙，所以暫綏一步，且等幾小時以後再說。現在還是集中全力，探尋中村小姐…各位老兄看…？」</p>
<p>「兄弟認爲事情有從經從權兩種辦法：」特字二號李明發表意見了。他的理由，「八的秘密」關係大局，時間旣是這樣急迫，不如雙方並進，反正人力很够。他主張從權辦理，開拆萍子的信件。</p>
<p>「看看那封秘密文件內容也好……也許需要多方面的準備，趁中村小姐的下落還未找到以前，一方面準備起來—這是說必需中村小姐指揮的話。萬一我們大家，也可按那密件的指導進行，時間也許要從容多了。」這是守一的意見。</p>
<p>「反正總是要看的；」鶴見略略猶豫了一下，便對正岩說「老岩，又得辛苦你一趟了……；」他預備呌正岩到萬歲館去取那文件。</p>
<p>「可是隊長藏起的那封文件？……正岩仍舊說的日語，「因爲害怕又出岔子，部下剛才到那邊的時候，順便拿了藏在身上了……」說着便從襯衫裏面，搯出了那封大使館送給萍子的公文，外封套已經沾上了些汗漬了。</p>
<p>「哈……」鶴見接過封套，又預備要獎勵正岩「學問進步」了，却因到底有生客在座，於是把話縮回去了。</p>
<p>封套拆開，裏面果然又是一個小型封套，寫着「上海大日本駐滬大使岡本閣下轉中村萍子小姐」等字樣。另外還有岡本給萍子的一封短扎；</p>
<p>「西原寺府邸要件一件，囑本館妥轉，因尊駕未曾再度光降，又恐延誤，特愼重奉上……」</p>

<h3>「愛麗絲漫游記」的故事</h3>
<p>— 楊實</p>
<p>牛津大學教授道格森（Prof.　Dodgson）很口吃，與人談話老是訥訥出不，但他却愛和小女孩玩。在一個下午他引着三個女孩在泰晤士河上駕船，孩子堅持要他說故事，我們的敎授便信口開河邊想邊說的描述一個荒誕的故事。那是一們在兎窟中睡着的女孩，她醒來時發現自已在一個奇異的神仙境界裏，並且她遇到了許多神奇的事。她們聽了大爲驚奇，要求他把它寫出來。道格森敎授開玩笑似答應了，他費了一夜時間完成了，並且定名爲「愛麗絲漫遊記」，愛麗絲新便是這三個小女孩中一個的名字。</p>
<p>寫完後，他把稿子放在一邊早忘却了。不久被個朋友看見，讀後請他出版，道敎授忿怒道：「你以爲牛津的敎授會拿這樣的東西去出版嗎？」他拒絕了。</p>
<p>這朋友也好奇，不顧他的反對刊印了出來。不意發刊之日轟動了倫敎的兒童，當天就搶售而空。道格森也找不出這本書爲什麽受兒童這樣熱烈歡迎的理由。</p>
<h3>片斷</h3>
<p>— 徐晉</p>
<p>民族幼苗，國家未來主人翁，這兩大兒童頭銜，是全國成年以上的同胞們一致擁護的。</p>
<p>提高兒童地位，增進兒童福利，……這些，都是兒童節例行的口號。</p>
<p>美術家不容易維妙維肖的描寫出活發，自然，天眞爛漫的可愛的兒童。</p>
<p>顧氏家訓說：「敎婦初來，敎兒嬰孩」，這便證明兒童敎育的重要。</p>
<p>在熱烈慶祝兒童節的今天，誰能對街頭流浪兒童，激發一些「幼吾幼以及人之幼」的天良？</p>
<p>兒童像是一張白紙，需要敎師們用黑字寫上「後生可畏，焉知來者」之不如今也的許多美麗史蹟。</p>

<h3>原子彈的災害</h3>
<p>— 東方慧</p>
<p>原子彈在廣島和長崎所造成的後果，究屬如何，它所造成的災害究竟到達何種程度？這都是各國的權威醫學者所關切的。</p>
<p>芝加哥大學的白魯斯博士，曾領導一批醫學人員（包括日本名醫生），在長崎，廣島精密的考察一番，他們的結論是；一九四五年的原子彈，雖已事隔十八個月，但它的生物性影響仍然存在於被炸地區，甚或持續至數年以後。他們檢査並研究了許多當時被原子彈炸傷炙傷的病人，他們發現原子彈幾種重要的後果災害。</p>
<p>最神秘的後果，是被原子彈大火炙傷者的皮膚上，形成　特殊的創痂。凡是曾受當時火炙或紫外綫輻射的，雖事隔多月，仍會陸續發生這種痂或瘢，色由粉紅以至棕赤，分佈全身及面部，浮腫如象皮，狀至可怖，起痂的皮膚感覺特殊靈敏，以致痛楚不堪。這類痂的範圍並不局限受傷的暴露部份，他會遂漸蔓延各處。醫生們認爲這種組織的破壞，或許是毒瘤的前驅，是否可用醫藥治療迄無把握。</p>
<p>原子彈另一顯著災害，就是破傷人的生殖能力。在廣島被炸數月之後，日本醫生檢査了一百二十四個劫後餘生者，發現其中三分之一已無生育能力。原子彈的爆炸，可使中彈點周圍直徑三哩之丙的生物失去生殖機能。曾在原子彈紫外綫輻射範圍中的婦女，有三分之二因而月經失調，原子能並使已懷孕的女性流產。</p>
<p>在遺傳方面，原子彈是否會造成一個惡劣的後果，則尙不可確知，因爲這需等待下一代的人生育時才可知道。若干生物學者拿廣島繁殖最快的果蠅來實騐。但是迄無滿意的結論。若干在炸後生產的小孩，都立即死去，或早成死胎，以後生育亦無報吿。但是醫生們深信，若干母親會把所生怪醜的嬰兒殺死並埋棄。</p>
<p>這直是件可怕的災害，原子彈不僅帶給現世人類的災難，减少他們的生殖機能，還使下一代的人類趨於醜惡而有絕滅之危。誰能說「古城末日記」的災難，會不再降臨世界呢？</p>
<h3>英語學者辜鴻銘</h3>
<p>— 涵光</p>
<p>讀四月一日自由談內「辜鴻銘軼事」，令人拍案呌絕，發笑不置；此老可謂幽默大家矣。適手頭有謝頌羔先生所作「英語學者辜鴻銘」一文，（載少年中國論文三〇—三一頁）亦叙及此老生平，爰譯之，以寄自由談。</p>
<p>「我從沒有遇見過辜鴻銘。我僅僅聽到關於他的一些事情和他的奇特的英語知識。他的拉丁文很好，而對於英文文學的閱讀，更是廣博。</p>
<p>他有一個小老婆。他讀英國文學，但是他的精神却是十足的中國式的。他不能够和現代的中國學生相處。</p>
<p>從這個，我得了一個敎訓。我們可以有豐富的英國語文知識，同時，也可能在英文寫作方面，練出一手美麗的英文格調，但是，却仍然不能得到英國人民的精神。英國人民的精神，主要地是基督敎的。他們特別看重誠實，純潔，（沒有小老婆）以及對於友朋們的公正的愛。</p>
<p>從一八八五到一九〇五，事氏在張之洞那裏做官。他有一妻一妾。我不知道他另外有沒有更多的老婆了。他忠於淸朝，老是拖着辮子。</p>
<p>事先生富有幽默感，然有時批評他人頗涉苛刻，他是個學者，但是他缺乏理想和現有精神。因此，可以說，他是個失敗者。我們必須爲人民服務，當我們工作失敗了的時候，我們便是失敗者啊！</p>
<p>我欽佩辜先生祗到某種程度，我希望我們能從他的許多弱點中解放出來。讓我們用敎育的力量爲平民謀利益。同時，讓我們祗愛一個女人並遵守我們的高尙的理想——忠實與民主」。</p>
<h3>快樂的孩子　——因歌唱交了鴻運</h3>
<p>— 榮觀</p>
<p>鋼鐵大王卡內基Addrew　Caroegie，靜坐在他辦公室的迴廊裏，他耳中聽得一個孩子的歌唱。那歌聲，如新鶯出谷，乳燕歸巢，就從那輕快而又優美的旋律裏，也見得這孩子內心的快樂來，爲了這歌正是他所酷愛着的一首，特別是那孩子底聲音。於是這孩子便被呌到面前，並常常爲他歌唱着了。</p>
<p>這孩子，不過是馬　裏司打雜的小厮，他每天洒洗着馬具，並淸理着馬房的時候，就隨口歌唱這悠揚而又愉快的歌——；他每天是一面工作，一面歌唱着的。就這樣，他的歌聲被送到附近不遠的鋼鐵大王的耳中去了。他從此被卡內基的提拔而且賞識，也就是後來的伯利恒鋼鐵公司的總經理，他的名字是査理·許華勃Charles　M.Schwab。</p>

<h3>「麗人行」</h3>
<p>— 馬高</p>
<p>作者先後兩部作品，「三個摩登的女性」與「麗人行」，基於民族對日解放鬥爭兩個階段，標示了兩個時代的典型人物與事件，而其中心問題則一：「女人，自由解放鬥爭中，雙重任務雙重痛苦的女人。」但，後者是具有更深更新的解釋和觀點。</p>
<p>在這裏作者嚴厲的譴責若英的弱點，鞭策了她貪戀物質享受與低頭妥協的卑賤情操。把她放在玉良和王仲原——善與非善之間受試煉，結果經不住試煉祗好搖尾乞憐投進安樂窠，這在她的路向是必然的：「妥協」。但是，作者希望她掙脫頸子上的鎖鍊，賦之以「光明尾巴」一條。看來就不免有牽强之感，像若英這樣的女人，在今天要她挺直的站起來，恐怕還不怎樣輕鬆吧？</p>
<p>被鼓勵被讚美的新羣，這個女戰士勇敢，能幹，肯幹，是理想中新女性的典範，但我們還嫌她不够豐滿，似乎在她身上還可以找出更多女性的生活的弱點來，她不應該長一無欠缺的偉大。</p>
<p>被侮辱與損害的靈魂，女工金妹是作者筆下最動人最完整的角色，是無數在悲劇命運承受難的女性的代表，有血，有肉，有淚，使人同情使人太息，唯有這樣的人走上新生之途的時候，才令人歡欣，令人地爲她祝福；因爲受盡磨折百鍊成鋼的人投進戰鬥是顚撲不破的。</p>
<p>這樣一個新型的多塲戲，第一次出現在我們的舞台上，給了我們一個可貴的豐收，榮譽應歸導演他強有力的巨手把全劇溶匯在新型的格調裏，那娓娓動聽的述說，那扣人心弦的控訴，在在都具工細的匠心，演員，是一個整體，合作，完整，即使最最不重要的角色，也都那末認眞賣力，値得讚揚。但有幾位字音欠正確，而且戲不「純」，有棱角。</p>
<p>但，我赤誠的向你推薦，這是一部太値得一看的佳構，無論劇本，導演，演技，都有新的可貴的收獲的佳構。</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>每個人都喜歡羡慕和自己不同地位的人，老百姓羡慕做官的，廟堂鼎食者却又喜歡取些「漁夫」「樵子」之類的別號。小孩子羨慕祖父的權能和自由，祖父撚着鬍鬚喟然長嘆地說：「如果我能倒退六十年，像這孩子一樣小，那纔眞是幸福。」男子羡慕女子的不勞而獲，女子羡慕男子的活動能力。這傾向說明了每倘人都不願意爲自己不同地位的人想一想，更無理智將彼此間的苦樂作一客觀的比較和認識。世界之擾攘不安，此種一般性的心理狀况，或亦不能辭其咎。</p>
<p>我想月亮之能入時所以較太陽爲多，或因其較吝惜降賜光明於吾人以及月僅一圓的緣故。</p>
<p>一顆乾枯的種子，會在適當的土壤上成長開花。</p>
<p>一個美麗的想像，會引起實生活許多變動。</p>
<p>一綫晴示，便足以　出「瞭悟」的漣漪。</p>
<p>我向愼植誇耀新的「瞭悟」爲巨大的太陽。</p>
<p>愼植輕農地笑着說。「因爲陽光特別刺眼的緣故，你才會特別喜歡太陽。實際上太陽和星星一樣，他的所以巨大，只是距離較近而已。在無限的空間，有無限個比太陽更巨大的存在。」</p>
<p>愼植的話，自有他的道理。然而，就我們的世界而論，我還是讚美太陽的。</p>
<h3>「推愛」</h3>
<p>— 呂彥</p>
<p>時常在八行書上見到「推愛」二字；「推愛」原本是人類美德的表現，降至如今，往往被一般人誤用了；甚至那麼毫不吝嗇，不費思索，歪曲地濫用着。</p>
<p>友人說了一件事實：某君懷有實才，失業年餘，寫了無數的應徵信，找了好幾處職業介紹的機關，照片用掉幾打，處處碰壁。終於靦覥的去見一位榮任「長」字頭的老同學，出乎意外的那位同學竟異當慷慨的給他一封介紹信，介紹他去見一位擁有一個龐大機構的主管。信內措辭誠懇，最後是：「推愛提掖」。他見了某主管後，又交換到一封介紹信，不免又一推愛」一番，在幾經輾轉「推愛」下，他拿到了最後的一封介紹信，從此他可以不再去作無謂的奔波了—那信封上的名字，赫然就是他的老同學。</p>
<h3>關於戰犯</h3>
<p>— 子濟</p>
<p>二十二日本報國際版有一隻「納粹巨犯，死無葬身之地」的新聞。說是去年十月被絞決之十大納粹戰犯，以及戈林之屍體，於火化後，置入軍用垃圾箱……乃將該箱置於一普通德國黑色轎車之後座，直駛慕尼黑伊薩河，投入急流之河水中，此乃「希特勒親信最大的旅程」云云。</p>
<p>納粹德國的戰犯審判，至此已吿一段落。混世魔王之屍灰，被投入念流之中，死無葬身之地，誠令人快慰不止。</p>
<p>但回視遠東法西餘孽，一味狡辯拖延情形，那使我們欷歔不已。眞是何厚此，而薄彼也。</p>
<p>東京國際法庭成立，雖爲時已久，而對戰犯迄未判決，這不但使我們戰勝國人民感到不耐煩，這審判的紐妮作態，即是在戰敗國日本臣民，也早已視爲笑料了。且看中央社東京專電：</p>
<p>「……國際法庭已開庭，何日結束尙不得而知……估計此項辯案，或將繼續兩月，審判或將仲秋，……法庭雇員四〇〇人，消耗紙張萬噸……日本人士已感不耐，並揚言爲諸不可辯護之戰爭嫌犯而辯護，何其荒唐，立即付諸　戒，乃爲上策，在日人眼中，對戰犯審判，已爲笑劇矣。</p>
<p>人情走馬，世事棋局，這是我國的一句諺句。大約日本雖是敗亡之國，但在美國支撑之下，國內已臻理想境地，蒸蒸日上。而麥帥又魅惑於日本朝野的阿諛諂媚，故處處給予「便利」。不僅戰犯而已。我們還聽到美國主張開放日私人貿易，並且在賠償物資中，剔除「和平工業」電動紡　機，使保全日紡織工業的新聞。</p>
<p>大好文章　在後面呢，瞧着吧。阿彌陀佛！</p>

<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「小榮，姐姐歡喜你，讓你坐小包車，跟金阿姨先上重慶去看爸爸好不好？」　回頭去向他柔聲地問。</p>
<p>「好的，好的。」榮兒畢竟還小，聽老祝方才說小包車那麽舒適，又可以先到重慶看見爸爸，當然就歡天喜地的答應了；並且當他住在徐紹明家裏的時候，金愛麗也時常　着他玩，給他的印象很不差，因此他倒不覺得有跟他媽一起走的必要。</p>
<p>「這樣也好！」老祝瞧這個問題一解決，便忙着再把方才沒有打好的那個舖蓋打起來；但蘭却更忙了，緋緋換了榮兒，衣服當然又得重新整理。</p>
<p>「媽！要不要給弟弟換一件衣服？」緋緋朝小榮身上看了一眼，很興奮地向她媽這樣建議着。</p>
<p>「好。把这一件给他换上吧！」蘭微笑着檢出了一套薄洋紗的童裝來。</p>
<p>緋緋很熟練地把小榮拖往屋子的一隅去，給他洗臉，洗手，脫下　的衣服，再換上那一身新衣，又用小梳子給他梳理着短髮，一些不亂，一些不慌；老祝幾次三番　腿過去看他們，腦海　立刻浮現出一個十來歲模樣的　的少女時代的影子。</p>
<p>將近十二點鐘的時候，祝兆年幫着蘭把一切都收拾好了，一個小小的舖蓋，裝着毯子，薄棉被和小榮的大部份的衣服；另外一大一小兩口皮箱，裝着蘭所認爲她們一家所有的比較値錢的東西。她本來遠想加一口，可是她担心金愛麗要爲難，便臨時又改變了主張。這一點祝兆年是十分贊成的，因爲他實在不願意太麻煩諸希農那樣一個腐化不堪的新官僚，以致影響自己將來發言的自由。</p>
<p>「弟弟，你把兎子爸爸留在這裏，讓我帶着它走好不好？」當老祝把洋車雇好，裝妥行李，回來準備帶他們一起出去的時候，緋緋忽然像想到了一件極重大的要事一樣的特別向小榮提出這個要求。</p>
<p>小榮原已跟着蘭快走出屋子了，聽他姐姐這麽一問，反而提醒了她。</p>
<p>「不成！不成！」他雙脚亂跳地說，同時轉身來向牀上望，兩只小眼睛得滾圓。「兔子爸爸呢？我要帶着走！媽！我要帶着走！」</p>
<p>他很快地撲往牀上去，在一疊枕頭後面　起了那頭銅製的兔子。蘭一下沒有來得及揪住他。</p>
<p>排緋失望地呆看着，臉上滿是沮喪的神情。（四）（五）</p>

<p>[Report from Jinan by this Newspaper, 26th] After four days and nights of fierce fighting between the defending troops of Tai'an and five times their number of Communist troops, due to the vast disparity in numbers, the Communist troops broke into the city after 9:00 PM on the 25th and fierce street fighting is still ongoing.</p>
<p>[Report from Jinan by this Newspaper, 26th] The fighting in the suburbs of Tai'an is intense and has entered its most tense stage since the evening of the 25th. Major fires broke out in Xiguan and Nanguan successively after 9:00 PM on the 25th. In addition, the fighting at Maozi in the northeast of Dakou and at the Niangniang Temple in the northwest is also fierce.

However, they have suffered a major blow from the National troops, and the Communist 4th and 5th Columns have suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>[Report from Xuzhou by this Newspaper, 26th] The offensive and defensive battle at Tai'an and Dakou in the central section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is fierce. The Communist 3rd Column launched an all-out attack on the southwestern area of Tai'an on the 25th. The National troops launched a strong counterattack and finally defeated them completely. The remnants of the Communist troops fled westward to Old Town. In addition, the main force of the Communist troops attacking Tai'an engaged in battle with the defending troops in the suburbs on the morning of the 26th.

Since the evening of the 25th, the Communist 3rd Column, which had originally fled to the area west of Tai'an, namely the Yuchi area, and its 7th Division, have continued to advance on Feicheng. At the same time, a unit of the Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region, which had been lying dormant among the people, also launched a fierce attack on Dong'a City.

This line of National troops has posed a great threat to the flank of the Communist troops besieging Tai'an.</p>
<p>[Report from Jinan by this Newspaper, 25th] The headquarters of the Communist Shandong Field Army has set up a command post in Xintai, personally commanded by Deputy Commander Piao Yu, and has set a deadline of five days to capture Tai'an.

<h3>Captured American Officer Says He Almost Faced Execution by the Chinese Communists</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 26th] U.S. Assistant Military Attaché Major Rigg and Captain Collins, in a press conference, recounted their experiences after being detained by the Chinese Communists, stating: During our detention, we learned that the Chinese Communists in the Northeast would hold a "People's Court" to try us for espionage and sentence us to death. It was not until Zhu De telegraphed Li Lisan on April 9, ordering our release, that we were spared this fate. For the first 35 days, we were repeatedly interrogated, with attempts to coerce and beat us into confessing that we were engaged in espionage for the National Army. After receiving Zhu De's order for our release on April 9, our treatment began to improve, and we were allowed to visit Harbin or go shopping on the streets. However, the Chinese Communist army treated us as prisoners of war and did not recognize our status as diplomats. The Chinese Communists in Harbin threatened us three times, claiming they would torture us and that this torture was permitted by international law, but we never believed this, and their threats did not cause us any serious concern.</p>
<p>Rigg also stated that he and Collins, along with a Chinese translator and driver, decided to go to the front lines of Changchun when they heard of Communist troop activity 13 miles outside Changchun, as he was very concerned about his family residing there. They rushed to the front lines, but before they could reach three miles, they saw two sentries. The translator was startled and tried to flee back to the jeep, but was shot by machine guns. Collins was hit head-on, but luckily fell into a ditch and was spared. They were then disarmed and taken to the command post.</p>
<p>They arrived in Harbin on March 6, and the Chinese Communists immediately informed them that they were prisoners of war, and they were immediately imprisoned and their belongings were taken away. On the evening of March 6, Collins was first questioned by the "so-called court," and he was subjected to the same questioning the following night, both being accused of "assisting the Kuomintang." It was not until March 9 that Li Lisan invited them to Li's residence for a meal and issued Zhu De's order for their release.</p>
<p>During their captivity, they enjoyed two Western meals a day, and the place they were living in had heating facilities, and they slept on plank beds with straw mats. The Communist army also provided toiletries. They spent most of their time reading books and newspapers and writing protests. The Chinese Communists provided them with two English Communist books, namely "Red Star Over China" and "China's Angry Roar."</p>

<h3>Review and Approval Process of the International Labour Organization Constitution Amendment in Our Country</h3>
<p>[Report from Nanjing by this Newspaper, 26th] The amendment to the Constitution of the International Labour Organization and the Convention on Amendments to Final Provisions have been approved by the 323rd Regular Meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 24th of this month: It has been passed according to the review opinions of the Labour Law Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee and approved. The situation regarding the amendment to the Constitution and the review and approval process in our country is explained as follows:</p>
<p>The International Labour Organization was originally one of the organizations of the old League of Nations. The Constitution of the International Labour Organization involves many aspects of the League of Nations. After the end of World War II, due to the emergence of the United Nations and the dissolution of the League of Nations, the International Labour Organization separated from the League of Nations and established relations with the United Nations. Its original Constitution therefore needed to be amended. On November 5, 1945, the 27th International Labour Conference passed the draft amendment to the Constitution of the International Labour Organization, amending the relevant provisions on three key points: the issue of member states of the organization listed in the original Constitution, fiscal budget measures, and the procedure for amending the Constitution. In addition, the relevant provisions involving the Secretary-General of the League of Nations or involving regulations related to the international community in the various conventions passed before the Constitution of the International Labour Organization was amended and the 28th International Labour Conference were also subject to concurrent amendments. The above amendments and conventions were submitted to the 29th International Labour Conference for further discussion and passage in accordance with the key points of the amendments passed by the 27th International Labour Conference and the constitutions that have been ratified by the member states. Our country is one of the eight major permanent directors of the International Labour Organization and has dispatched government representatives to attend the Working Group on Constitutional Issues and the 29th International Labour Conference. All of the aforementioned amendments and conventions were submitted by the Ministry of Social Affairs to the Executive Yuan, which then transferred them to the Legislative Yuan. After the Labour Law Committee, together with the Foreign Affairs Committee, reviewed them, they were submitted to the 323rd meeting of the Legislative Yuan for resolution and approval. Thus, the legislative procedure has been completed, and the amendment and the Convention on Amendments to Final Provisions will take effect. The original text of the amendment is copied below:</p>
<p>"Amendment to the Constitution of the International Labour Organization": The General Conference of the International Labour Organization, convened by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, held its 29th Session in Montreal on September 19, 1946. The Conference, having considered the question of the amendment of the Constitution of the International Labour Organization, which is the second item on the agenda of the Session, having taken note of the various proposals made in this connection, decides to adopt them, and hereby, this ninth day of October, nineteen hundred and forty-six, passes the following amendment to the Constitution of the International Labour Organization. That is, the amendment may be referred to as the International Labour Organization Constitution Amendment of 1946.</p>
<p>Article 1 The Constitution of the International Labour Organization whose current provisions are contained in the first line of the unamended annex shall, from the date on which this amendment begins to take effect, take effect in accordance with the amendment method contained in the second line of the annex.</p>
<p>Article 2 Two copies of the model of this amendment shall be signed by the President of the Conference and the Director-General of the International Labour Office, one of which shall be kept in the files of the International Labour Office, and the other shall be sent to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for registration in accordance with Article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations. The Director-General shall also distribute the corrected version of this amendment to the member states of the International Labour Organization.</p>
<p>Article 3 (1) All formal instruments of ratification or acceptance of this amendment shall be sent to the Director-General of the International Labour Office for notification to the member states of the International Labour Organization. (2) This amendment shall come into force in accordance with the provisions of Article 36 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organization. (3) Once this amendment begins to take effect, the Director-General of the International Labour Office shall immediately notify the member states of the International Labour Organization, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and the countries that signed the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
<h3>Fierce Bloodshed Erupts at Niangzi Pass; Main Force of the Communist Army in Northern Shaanxi Begins Crossing to the East</h3>
<p>[Report from Beiping by this Newspaper, 26th] The situation along the Zhengtai Railway is increasingly tense, with fierce fighting taking place at Niangzi Pass, Pingding, and Yangquan. On the morning of the 25th, the Communist 3rd Column, in coordination with 4,000 militiamen, surrounded Niangzi Pass and engaged in fierce bloodshed with the defending troops in the afternoon. Two regiments of the Communist army that infiltrated Shanxi near Jingxing are also preparing scaling ladders in an attempt to attack Pingding City. Fighting is also taking place at Yangquan Station. In addition, a unit of the Communist army that retreated from Yuanshi is roaming in the border area between Hebei and Shanxi, entering Longguan, with the intention of infiltrating the Zhengtai Railway.</p>
<p>[Report from Taiyuan by this Newspaper, 25th] The focus of the war on the Zhengtai Line has shifted to the west of Niangzi Pass. The Communist army's intention (1) seems to be to invade Fenghuoling, cutting off the National army's aid route to Henan and Shaanxi. (2) To destroy the Yangquan coal mine, but both are difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>[Report from Taiyuan by this Newspaper, 25th] The fighting at Niangzi Pass was fierce on the 25th. The National army is confident in relieving the crisis in Yangquan. Reinforcements have arrived, and a decisive battle has begun. The Communist army's attempt to bypass the north and cut off the Wutai Road between Yangquan and Shouyang has been defeated by the National army. The prelude to a major battle in the Yuncheng area of southern Shanxi has been unveiled. Yuncheng is already under threat from the east and west by the Communist army. Yishi and Linjin are reported to have been captured again. Eleven counties in southern Shanxi have fallen into the hands of the Communist army.</p>
<p>[Report from Beiping by this Newspaper, 26th] The war situation in southern Shanxi: (1) The Communist army that retreated from Yuncheng is rapidly roaming in the suburbs of Pinglu County. Modizhen, northwest of Pinglu, was captured by the Communist army on the 25th. Two routes of the Communist army surrounded Zhangdianzhen in an attempt to cut off the National army's supply line.

When reporters asked for his thoughts on the reorganization of our government, the ambassador said "very good." The ambassador also told reporters that he may travel to Qingdao soon, and the original plan to go to Hankou has been canceled due to the bad weather.</p>
<p>[Report from Nanjing by this Newspaper, 26th] It is rumored that after the loan is successful, the new currency will be issued, and the currency will be linked to international currency (i.e., the U.S. dollar).</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 25th] A report said that China has ordered machinery under the $500 million loan. When reporters inquired to a senior official of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, he replied: The U.S. has not taken steps to disburse the $500 million loan. The cutoff date for this loan is June 30, which is the end of this fiscal year. A spokesperson for the State Department made a statement on the 1st of this month, saying that the State Department's position has not changed. The spokesperson said that before disbursing the loan, China should have the following conditions: (1) China should propose various suggestions, (2) The suggestion should be approved by the State Department, (3) It must be approved by the Export-Import Bank. At that time, the spokesperson emphasized that the Chinese side is well aware of the conditions that China must have domestically in order to obtain the loan, and said that since President Truman outlined these conditions in September last year, the United States' policy has not changed in this regard.</p>

There is still a distance between the two sides. Since the news released by the United Press is not a formal announcement document of the U.S. government, the Chinese government does not intend to make any formal statement and will formally propose liquidation at the Washington liquidation meeting.</p>

<h3>Nine Years of Blood Debt Now Repaid; Tani Hisao Executed by Firing Squad; More Than 10,000 Spectators Cheer at Yuhuatai</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Tani Hisao, the main culprit in the Nanjing Massacre, was executed by firing squad at 11:50 AM on the 26th in Nanjing, killed by a single shot. The National Government Chairman's approval order was delivered to the Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense on the 25th. At 9:45 AM on the 26th, Prosecutor Chen Guangyu brought Tani from the war criminal detention center for a final interrogation and announced his death sentence. When Tani was escorted to the execution site, his complexion was as before. He was wearing a yellow military uniform and black velvet cotton shoes, without a hat, and his gait was slightly unsteady. As per routine, his age and origin were questioned, and then three sets of family letters were given to Tani to read. At the time, Tani still did not know that his death was imminent. He hastily read them and put them in his pocket. When the prosecutor asked if he needed to write back, he seemed to understand a little and wrote letters on the spot to his wife, son, and grandson, sighing all the while, for about a quarter of an hour. Then, the prosecutor read aloud the Chairman's telegram on the spot (attached below), and continued: "The trial and judgment of your case are very accurate and fair because you not only ordered the massacre in the Zhonghuamen area, but also went to various places in the city to massacre. You must be very clear about this. Other matters, such as the Nanjing Massacre and the killing contest, were published in large articles in Japanese newspapers, so there is no need to argue. Therefore, today's execution is very fair." Hearing this, Tani still made a final sophistry, saying, "Apart from participating in the entrance ceremony, I did not go to the city. Until this moment, I still hope that the court can clarify the whole case before making a decision, otherwise it will regret it in the future." The prosecutor said, "I have no authority other than to execute. Do you have any instructions for your family and after your death?" Tani spoke quickly, looking at the ground, and strongly claimed: "The defendant has nothing to do with this case. The defendant now believes that it will definitely be clarified in the future. I hope that this judgment will not affect future Sino-Japanese relations and that the court will pay attention to the defendant's witnesses in future trials." Finally, Tani asked to write a will to his wife. At that time, Tani's voice was trembling and his body was shaking, with tears in his eyes. Warden Yang of the detention center gave him a cigarette to smoke. He wrote and smoked until 10:45 AM, and then took out his belongings and asked them to be handed over. He was very careful when sorting out the items, and he could not find a watch he had left behind, as if he still had regrets. At 11:10 AM, he finished sorting out and announced the adjournment of the court. Tani was escorted onto the prison van. The presiding judge and prosecutor, etc., all went to the execution ground in person in many cars. Citizens along the way, upon hearing that Tani was being executed, were overjoyed and followed the van. Before reaching Zhonghuamen, the crowd was already lining the streets. By the time they reached Yuhuatai, the mountains and valleys were full of people, cheering. After nine years of blood debt, they were finally able to have their revenge. At 11:45 AM, the van arrived at the execution ground. Tani was escorted down from the van. Except for his unsteady gait, he showed no other changes. At 11:50 AM sharp, the execution began. Prosecutor Chen gave the order, and Hong Ergen executed the shot. A single shot entered from the back of the head and exited from the mouth, exposing the gums. Tani took the bullet and immediately fell backward, dying silently. At that time, more than 10,000 spectators around cheered thunderously. This former demon king who rampaged on Zijin Mountain was now brought to justice at Yuhuatai, which was an unparalleled comfort for the millions of citizens of Nanjing.</p>
<p>Chairman's Telegram Approving Execution</p>
<p>The original text of the Chairman's telegram is recorded as follows: "According to the case presented by Chief Judge Shi: I have read the presentation and documents of this court on March 19 of this year. After investigation, the defendant Tani Hisao jointly ordered the troops to massacre prisoners and non-combatants during the war, and committed rape, robbery, and destruction of property. Since the interrogation has proven this clearly, the original sentence of death is appropriate and should be approved. As for the defendant's reasons for requesting a retrial, they do not comply with the provisions of Article 45 of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Trial Law and should be rejected. I hope you will comply with the execution and report the execution date for verification. The judgment shall be kept in the case file and returned, Zhongzheng."</p>
<p>Military Tribunal Announces Crimes</p>
<p>The Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense announced Tani's crimes as follows:</p>
<p>After investigation, the war criminal Tani Hisao jointly ordered the troops to massacre prisoners and non-combatants during the war in Nanjing, and committed rape, robbery, and destruction of property. The evidence is conclusive. This court has already sentenced him to death on March 10 of this year, in accordance with Article 4, Paragraph 2, Article 23, Paragraph 3, Paragraph 7, Article 28, Article 46, and Article 47 of the Hague Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, Article 2 and Article 3 of the Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Article 1, Article 2, Paragraph 2, Article 3, Paragraph 1, Paragraph 4, Paragraph 24, Paragraph 27, and Article 11 of the War Criminals Trial Regulations, and reported it to Chief of Staff Chen, and then to the Chairman of the National Government Jiang, who approved the execution by telegram on April 25 of this year. In compliance with the order, at 10:00 AM on the 26th of this month, the prosecutor of this court brought the war criminal Tani Hisao, verified his identity, and escorted him to the Yuhuatai execution ground to carry out the death penalty according to law. War criminal Tani Hisao, male, 66 years old, Japanese, residing at 53 Fujimicho, Nakanoku, Tokyo, Japan, Lieutenant General of the Japanese Army Division Commander.</p>
<p>Tani's Will to His Wife, Umeko</p>
<p>The translated text of Tani Hisao's will to his wife Umeko is as follows: "April 26, Showa 23 (1948), my death sentence has been carried out! Before knowing about the execution, I gave you another letter, and this pair of wills, as a memorial for our eternal farewell. Umeko, you have fulfilled your responsibility as a supportive wife, and I want to thank you deeply here. I am being executed now due to the erroneous judgment of the Chinese side, which is truly regrettable. I am confident that one day it will be made clear whether I have committed international crimes. But I alone do not matter. I am finally dying in Yuhuatai, which is ultimately serving my country. I have no emotional struggles. Please help them. Please nurture Kiyoko and Hideko to become useful people. Although my body will turn to ash in a foreign land, my soul will ultimately return to you. It is now noon on April 26th. After saying goodbye to you, I will be gone forever. I hope everyone can be happy. I can still stand and say goodbye to everyone, but in a moment, I will fall down forever. This is unfortunate, but it is also fate. I am a man, and dying for my country is something to be satisfied with. I have completed the journey of life. Lieutenant General Takahashi and Staff Officer So笠厥 personally witnessed my final form. They can tell you that everything is fate. Sixty-six years old has become the last year of my life. Until my death, I believed that I was not wrong and tried my best to the very end, but I was ultimately shot, which is truly regrettable. My dearest Umeko, farewell forever. Please cremate my remains and take the ashes back. I am not afraid. I wish my family happiness. My thoughts and Umeko's thoughts are completely aligned. I pray to the heavens for Umeko's longevity. Farewell forever!"</p>

<h3>China-UK Civil Aviation Negotiations; Rumor of Deadlock Is Inaccurate</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Regarding the rumor that the China-UK civil aviation negotiations have reached a deadlock, this reporter asked a certain Chinese representative who participated in the negotiations, who said that the two sides are currently continuing to deliberate on the wording, and the rumor of a deadlock is not true.</p>
<h3>U.S. Relief United Association to China: Helping Us Cultivate Talent</h3>
<p>[City News] The United States Relief United Association to China was established in the wartime capital of Chongqing during the War of Resistance against Japan, formerly known as the "United States Relief Association for China." It was an American public relief organization for China. At the beginning of this year, in order to strengthen its postwar efforts, the association was formally renamed "United States Relief United Association to China." The association believes that postwar China urgently needs specialized talent in education, medicine, and social welfare for reconstruction work. Therefore, future aid to China will focus on cultivating specialized talent, including assisting in organizing various training courses, assisting schools at all levels and work demonstration areas, and subsidizing various reconstruction programs.</p>

<h3>Two Students from Beijing and Tianjin Attempt Robbery: Shot Dead on the Spot by Military Police</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 26th] A robbery occurred in Beijing last night. The two robbers, resembling students from a certain college in Tianjin, were shot dead on the spot. At 8 p.m., as the Wei Baohua Restaurant in Longfusi Temple was closing, two robbers wearing student uniforms entered the restaurant to rob. After reporting to the police and military police, nearly a hundred people were immediately mobilized to surround the restaurant. The robbers crossed over into the house next door and fired shots to resist arrest, even holding a baby in the room hostage. The military police advised them to surrender their weapons and surrender, but the robbers claimed, "We are students, forced by the pressures of life. Please forgive us and let us live. Otherwise, we would rather die than surrender our weapons." The two sides confronted each other for three hours, exchanging dozens of shots. Finally, under unavoidable circumstances, they were shot dead under the bed in a hail of bullets. The two robbers had only one Browning pistol. One wore a student uniform, and the other wore Western-style trousers with a deerskin top and a vest underneath, with the words "Industry and Commerce" from ( 省) Province on it. The court went to examine the bodies today, but no one has claimed them.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Countermeasures to Suppress Rice Prices</h3>
<p>The food problem for the people has indeed become very serious recently. Although the authorities have repeatedly tried to lower prices and have been selling off rice for days, the market still has supply but no sales. Many rice shops even claim they have no goods to sell, and white rice is nowhere to be seen. The little that is available is only a small amount of indica rice. Some shops do not even have that available. It is truly a strange state of affairs.</p>
<p>Because according to the facts, this city is not short of rice. Not counting the public and private stockpiles, even though arrivals are said to be scarce, there is still a steady stream of 1,000 to 2,000 shi of rice arriving each day, registered in the market. It is impossible to count the rice that is not brought to market. The most reliable statistics are probably the 9,000 bags sold off by the Social Affairs Bureau every day. Among them are white rice, tribute rice, and red-tipped rice. According to population calculations, this supply of over 10,000 shi is more than enough to maintain the food supply for the people of this city. Moreover, the authorities have indicated that they can increase the supply if necessary.</p>
<p>Therefore, the crux of the problem clearly lies not in the supply but in hoarding and smuggling, that is, the so-called flow into the black market. There is strong evidence for this: (1) The authorities have dispatched police to strictly inspect exports and prevent reverse flows. If there were no smuggling problems, why would such strict prevention be necessary? (2) In the past two days, the police and Social Affairs Bureau have investigated and found many rice shops hoarding rice and refusing to sell. Is this not a practical example of rice merchants hoarding for profit?</p>
<p>Now the authorities are taking swift and decisive action, sending out teams to investigate. These hoarding and smuggling problems will undoubtedly continue to be discovered and punished according to law. But the question is whether these measures can eradicate the black market and maintain a normal food supply. In other words, will those black market merchants take this prohibition seriously and change their ways, no longer deliberately trying to outsmart the authorities? Probably no one dares to guarantee that! Now the rewards are the highest, the penalties are the most severe, and the inspections are the strictest for gold banknotes, but the gold banknote black market has never disappeared. It can be seen that relying solely on inspections and arrests to achieve the goal of stabilizing the rice market and maintaining the food supply for the people is probably still quite a distance away in reality.</p>
<p>Since passive measures have not fully achieved their purpose, then, when one avenue is exhausted, one must change course and take further measures. How should one begin with these further measures? We believe there are two possible paths to follow.</p>
<p>First, implement a purchase system to stabilize the lives of public servants and employees. The Economic Emergency Measures Plan stipulates, "Each factory, to supply workers with the necessary food, cloth, and fuel, should request the government to purchase on their behalf and should not freely purchase, which is a disguised form of hoarding." The detailed rules for implementing the measures for supplying essential daily necessities to the people have even more detailed regulations on how to supply and distribute daily necessities to public servants and employees. Article 6 states, "The government will sell goods when necessary to regulate the market." At the beginning of implementation, due to insufficient preparation, cash difference was issued for the employee portion, in order to be simple and quick. This was originally a temporary expedient. Now that rice prices are soaring and rice shops are exhibiting a phenomenon of having no goods to sell, the responsible authorities should earnestly take responsibility for purchasing on behalf and supplying in kind according to the principle of quantitative allocation, in order to stabilize the lives of general employees. Employees and public servants are only a portion of the citizens. Even if the entire food problem for the people cannot be completely solved after implementing quantitative allocation, it is better than the sold-off rice flowing into the black market, only satisfying the pockets of a few unscrupulous merchants. Moreover, with food guaranteed, workers will be more stable, and labor unrest can be expected to decrease. Therefore, in addition to the rice for public servants being handled according to the plan, it is also necessary to allocate actual goods to general employees. The government currently holds a considerable amount of rice. We believe that, in addition to these types of employees, other businesses, organizations, and private schools, all staff and employees, may as well be allowed to submit lists of names and receive a fixed allocation, in order to ensure that everyone shares the benefits equally and to stabilize the rice market.</p>
<p>Second, follow the example of sugar and implement rationing according to household registration. This method is the most thorough and also the most reasonable. Because if this is done, as long as the allocation is sufficient for practical use and the allocation price is not higher than the free price in neighboring areas, a black market will simply not occur. And the rice sold off by the government will naturally benefit the common people, grain by grain. It is heard that relevant parties have also proposed this. The reason for the delay in making a decision is because there are two difficulties. One is that it requires a large number of personnel and expenses to handle, and it cannot be done in the same way as the quantitative allocation of sugar and public servants and employees, which can be done by relying on others to handle it completely. The second is that the rice for allocation must have a source, which can be drawn upon continuously, and it is not convenient to be intermittent or to rely entirely on the central government. These two concerns are both facts and must be carefully considered. Originally, handling rationing is a very cumbersome and costly task. If one only relies on verbal promises and seeks to be simple and economical, then there is no way to even talk about it. Otherwise, the baojia system and household registration already have a considerable foundation, and sugar rationing is already being held continuously. One only needs to establish a responsible agency to take charge of the matter, or to expand and reorganize an existing similar allocation agency, and it seems that the first difficulty in terms of personnel can be easily resolved. As for the source of rice, it is indeed more difficult. But in addition to the Ministry of Food allocating rice, there has also been foreign rice arriving at the port recently. As long as there is a dedicated agency responsible for procuring it, it is not impossible. Because although domestic prices are high, the stock of grain has not reached the point of being completely exhausted. If the local government organizes it in terms of investment and transportation, it should be more convenient than private individuals. It is said that Jiangsu already has a ban on rice leaving the province, and the ability of rice merchants to procure and transport rice will inevitably be further weakened. In fact, it is also unavoidable for the government to take on part of the responsibility to ensure the source. Then, the only concern is that it will cost some money.</p>
<p>All politics inevitably cost some money. One only needs to see if the cost is worthwhile and whether it truly benefits the people. The so-called "take from the people, use for the people," is this principle not often spoken of with pleasure by financial personnel?</p>
<p>Therefore, the expenses for handling rice rationing are not so much a matter of whether they should be considered, but rather whether one is willing to consider them.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, it has been said that "the people regard food as heaven." If rice prices can be stabilized, then the hearts of the people can also be stabilized. As a result, prices, wages, livelihoods, the market, and even social stability and order can be solved in part. Since Mayor Wu took office last year, he has indeed paid great attention to food for the people and has made the greatest efforts. This can be said to be a unique insight. However, in order to eradicate the black market and ensure the supply of food for the people, the two suggestions above, although they are old sayings, seem to be worth considering. If they can be implemented, we believe that their effectiveness will not be less than simply selling off rice and passively investigating and arresting.</p>

<h3>White House Scheduled to Meet Tonight: Reviewing U.S. Foreign Policy; Current U.S.-Soviet Relations Highly Noteworthy; Truman Invites Congressional Leaders to Hear Marshall's Report</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Marshall is scheduled to broadcast the proceedings of the Moscow Conference on Tuesday at 1:30 a.m. standard time (10:30 p.m. Shanghai time).</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 25th] President Truman today invited leaders from both parties in Congress to meet with Secretary of State Marshall at the White House on the evening of the 27th to review the future of foreign policy. Marshall is returning from Moscow to report to the nation on the evening of the 28th about the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference and to answer new questions in Congress regarding foreign policy. According to the State Department, Marshall will broadcast to the nation for half an hour on the evening of the 28th, and will likely hold talks with members of Congress in the following days. When Marshall went to Moscow in February, it seemed that the two major issues of the Italian peace treaty and the $350 million aid plan for liberated countries had been concluded, but while Marshall was abroad, members of Congress who were good at criticizing brought up the old issues again. The senators hope that Marshall will submit a comprehensive report on the current stage of U.S.-Soviet relations based on the results of the Moscow Conference. The main issue is the $400 million aid plan for Greece and Turkey. The plan has already been approved by the Senate and will be voted on in the House of Representatives next week.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington, 25th] A responsible official told an Agence France-Presse reporter today that after Secretary of State Marshall returns to Washington, he will likely first discuss the possibility of a Pan-American Conference with President Truman and the measures to be taken to prompt Brazil to convene this conference in June or July. In fact, since the failure of the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference, American diplomats have been in agreement with the Army and Navy Departments that it is necessary for the American countries to sign an international defense pact to ensure the unity of the Western Hemisphere and thwart Soviet attempts to participate. In the current situation, President Truman and Marshall seem to advocate the immediate passage of a law allowing the United States to provide war equipment to Latin America within the scope of the American international pact, so as to standardize all countries in the Western Hemisphere. To achieve this goal, Marshall must eliminate the differences of opinion between Braden, the head of the Latin American Affairs Office of the State Department, and the Argentine government, and determine whether the Argentine government has fulfilled the obligations stipulated in the Chapultepec Pact. Braden believes that the United States must sign the American international defense pact after the Argentine government fulfills all its obligations.</p>
<h3>Marshall Flies from Berlin to Washington</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Berlin, 25th] U.S. Secretary of State Marshall's plane left here at 13:26 Greenwich Mean Time (10:26 p.m. Shanghai time) today, flying to Washington. Due to bad weather, Marshall's plane changed to the northern route and is expected to arrive in Washington at 17:00 Greenwich Mean Time on the 26th (2:00 a.m. on the 27th in Shanghai time).</p>
<h3>U.S. State Department Decides to Establish a Policy Planning Staff: Formulating Long-Term U.S. Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington, 25th] U.S. Acting Secretary of State Acheson recently told the press that Secretary of State Marshall had requested the establishment of a planning staff within the State Department to be responsible for formulating the long-term foreign policy to be adopted by the United States. This planning staff has already been established and will be composed of five experts, with George Kennan, a senior official of the State Department and a Soviet affairs expert, as the chairman. However, this staff does not have executive power and can only adjust and draft plans, and it can consult with experts outside the State Department. The State Department has drafted an outline of this plan, which is still awaiting Marshall's approval.</p>
<h3>U.S.-Soviet Lend-Lease Accounts to Begin Liquidation</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 25th] U.S. Acting Secretary of State Acheson recently said that the United States is about to negotiate with Soviet representatives to resolve the $11.3 billion lend-lease loan owed by the Soviet Union. Soviet Ambassador to the United States Novikov, accompanied by four economic experts, arrived in Washington on the 24th and will participate in this negotiation.</p>
<h3>Bevin and Clay to Meet in Berlin</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 25th] Informed sources here are very interested in the news that British Foreign Secretary Bevin will meet with the heads of the Allied Control Council in Berlin, and believe that General Clay, the commander of the U.S. forces in Germany, will participate in this conversation. General Clay recently said that if the Moscow Conference unfortunately fails, then after the economic merger of the British and American occupation zones in Germany, a political merger should follow. However, officials here are keeping silent on this matter.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 26th] Reports that British Foreign Secretary Bevin proposed to the government the establishment of a Western Germany and the elimination of the boundaries between the British, American, and French occupation zones in Germany have been denied by the Foreign Office.</p>
<h3>Failure of the Moscow Conference: A Glimpse of Japanese Public Opinion</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Tokyo, 26th] The adjournment of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference without result is met with disappointment and hope in Japan. Those with hope believe that the stalemate in Europe is sufficient to accelerate the negotiation of a peace treaty with Japan, and now hope that MacArthur will make a proposal again. However, those who still painfully remember the war are deeply worried about the stalemate between the Soviet Union and the Western countries. Japanese observers say that the dark situation in Moscow has caused incredible rumors here. Some say that a U.S.-Soviet war will inevitably break out in June, and others say that the U.S. military is stepping up the training of Japanese aviators. Many people in Tokyo are almost neurotic, and some have already moved to the countryside to escape the war. The Japanese have paid close attention to the proceedings of the British Conference, and are particularly comforted by the firm opposition of the United States and Britain to the Soviet Union's immediate claim for reparations from German industrial production, believing that when the same issue is raised at a future peace conference with Japan, Britain and the United States may also advocate on their behalf.</p>
<h3>UN Special Session Opens Tomorrow: Discussing the Palestine Problem; Guo Taiqi Appointed Chief Representative of Our Country</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency New York, 25th] According to an announcement today, the official list of personnel of the delegation of our country participating in the special session of the United Nations General Assembly to be convened on the 28th has been submitted to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie. The delegation includes Head Guo Taiqi, Deputy Head Xia Jinlin, Secretary-General and Advisor Zhang Zhongfu, Advisors Xu Shuxi, Zheng Zhenyu, and Wei Xueren, and technical expert Lin Xianrang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 25th, Associated Press] The State Department announced that Austin has been appointed as the chief representative of the United States to the special session of the United Nations General Assembly, and Johnson as the deputy representative.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Lake Success, 25th] Regarding the request made by the Arab countries, advocating that Britain cease its trusteeship of Palestine and establish an independent Palestinian state. According to an official announcement, this request will not be included in the provisional agenda of the UN General Assembly.</p>
<p>Five Powers Discuss the Agenda</p>
<p>[Central News Agency New York, 25th] The representatives of the five powers, including Guo Taiqi of our country, held an informal consultation with Secretary-General Trygve Lie this afternoon on the procedural issues of the UN General Assembly on the 28th. Reporters learned from reliable sources that (1) the attitude of the Soviet Union towards the proposal of the Arab countries to immediately begin a full discussion of the independence of Palestine was not explored during the discussion; (2) the five powers informally agreed that Brazilian former Foreign Minister Aranha would be the most suitable candidate for the chairmanship of this session; (3) In addition, the five powers, in their capacity as vice-chairmen of the General Assembly, may give the remaining two vice-chairmanship positions to Colombian representative López and representatives from India or the Philippines. It is also learned that the five powers discussed the issue of the chairmen of the six standing committees of the General Assembly, and agreed that they should be held by Canada, Czechoslovakia, Egypt, Sweden, India, and Poland or Mexico, and they will also discuss the candidates for the powerful steering committee of the General Assembly. It is reported that the five powers also agreed to formally welcome Siam to participate in the General Assembly as a new member state of the United Nations.</p>
<p>Arab Countries Express Their Position</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Cairo, 25th] The Arab position on the Palestine issue will be presented to the special session of the United Nations General Assembly by five of the seven countries of the Arab League. The five countries are Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. Yemen and Transjordan are not members of the United Nations and therefore will not participate in the presentation. However, the five countries have not been given full authority by their superior, the Supreme Committee of Palestine, which has announced that it can deny any decision made by the five countries. The committee itself is sending two representatives to attend the UN General Assembly as observers, and they will maintain contact with the Arab representatives of the UN institutions. The position of the Arabs of Palestine is clear: they insist on two points, namely (1) establishing an independent Palestinian Arab state; (2) completely stopping Jewish immigration into Palestine. This position is somewhat similar to that stipulated in the British White Paper of 1939.</p>
<h3>Balkan Countries Intensify Cooperation: Organizing an Economic Alliance: To Respond to the U.S. Anti-Soviet Plan</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 25th] Trade negotiations between Eastern European countries have intensified in recent weeks. A trade agreement between Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria has been signed in Sofia. Observers in London believe that the intensified activities between Eastern European countries are related to President Truman's aid plan for Greece and Turkey and the U.S. refusal to aid Yugoslavia. Some quarters even predict that the governments of the pro-Soviet countries in Southeastern Europe may organize a Balkan economic alliance to respond to the U.S. anti-Soviet economic plan. It is reported that trade negotiations between Poland and Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Yugoslavia, and Poland and Romania are all underway. Short-term trade agreements have already been concluded between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria at the beginning of the month.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Recommends Wold as Governor of Trieste</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Lake Success, 25th] Well-informed sources said today that the Soviet Union has appointed Norwegian Supreme Court Justice and former Minister of Justice Wold to serve as Governor of Trieste. Representatives of the United Kingdom and the United States on the United Nations Security Council have notified Soviet Representative Gromyko that they are willing to consult with their respective governments on this recommendation. Wold is the second name proposed by the Soviet Union. The first name proposed was Branting of Sweden, who was reportedly rejected by the United States due to a lack of administrative experience. Wold once served as the Norwegian Foreign Minister during the war, and later became the leader of the Norwegian government-in-exile, returning to the country in November 1944. Since then, he has served as the representative of Norway to the Allied War Crimes Commission, the representative to the United Nations General Assembly in London, and the representative to the Paris Peace Conference.</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Representatives Re-election: Socialist Party Emerges as a Force: Likely to Organize a Coalition Cabinet</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Tokyo, 26th] Recent reports of the Japanese House of Representatives re-election show that the Socialist Party has won 136 seats, surpassing the ruling Liberal Party. The Democratic Party ranks third, with 113 seats. The Communist Party won only 4 seats. Although the Socialist Party has won, the conservatives (including the Liberal Party, the Democratic Party, and various small right-wing parties) still hold an absolute majority in the House of Representatives. Therefore, if the Socialist Party wants to govern, it must organize a coalition cabinet. If the victory of the Socialist Party is confirmed, then the party leader Tetsu Katayama seems likely to become Prime Minister. Katayama is a lawyer, currently 60 years old, and has authored many books on socialism.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Tokyo, 26th] The first general vote count results of the Japanese House of Representatives re-election are as follows: Social Democratic Party: 143 seats, an increase of 45 seats compared to before; Liberal Party: 131 seats, a decrease of 9 seats compared to before; Democratic Party: 123 seats, a decrease of 12 seats compared to before; Cooperative Party: 31 seats, a decrease of 32 seats compared to before; Communist Party: 24 seats, a decrease of 2 seats compared to before; Various small parties: 31 seats; Independents: 13 seats.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Tokyo, 26th] In yesterday's re-election of the Japanese House of Representatives, Prime Minister Yoshida won the vast majority of votes in Kochi Prefecture for the first time and was elected, with nearly 24,000 votes. According to the new constitution, Yoshida still has the right to participate in the new government. Other cabinet members of the current cabinet who participated in the election, including Finance Minister Ishiguro, Interior Minister Uehara, Justice Minister Kimura, and Minister without Portfolio Saito, have also been elected. Yoshida, Ishiguro, and Uehara are all leaders of the Liberal Party, while Saito belongs to the Minseito Party. Veteran member of Congress Yukio Ozaki was elected at the age of 89.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union and Afghanistan Conduct Border Demarcation Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Reuters Moscow, 26th] The Soviet News Agency reported that a four-member delegation of experts from Afghanistan has arrived in Tashkent to participate in the work of the Soviet-Afghan Border Commission, which was established in accordance with the Soviet-Afghan Border Agreement of June 13, 1946.

<h3>Prior to Departure, Wallace Met with the French Communist Party Leader; Wallace Returns to the U.S. from Europe and Plans to Lobby Across the Americas</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 26th] Wallace has completed his tour of Europe, a series of lectures lasting eighteen days. Today, he flew back to New York.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 25th] Wallace told reporters: Before returning to the United States, I also plan to travel and give speeches throughout the Americas, expressing my opinion on the necessity of engaging in economic plans to revive the world. This is a peaceful way to save the current crisis.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 25th] Wallace met with three leaders of the French Communist Party this afternoon: Dougros, the leader of the Communist Party deputies and Vice-President of the National Assembly; Gauny, the editor of the Communist Party newspaper "L'Humanité"; and Pondé, a Communist Party deputy, to discuss the general situation.</p>
<p>Talking About the Palestine Issue</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 25th] Wallace, hosting reporters here today, put forward two suggestions for resolving the Palestine issue. He believes that the natural resources of the Near East should be developed to allow Palestine to accommodate a large number of residents. At the same time, the U.S. government should remove obstacles to the relocation of European refugees to the United States within three years. Wallace believes that the Palestine issue is one that can never satisfy anyone. He sympathizes with the Jewish people's demands for nation-building and their desire to obtain a voice in the United Nations, but he condemns terrorist activities. Finally, he expressed his belief that Britain will be able to find a solution to the Palestine issue.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Continues to Oppose the International Gendarmerie Plan, No Agreement Reached</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 25th] The United Nations Military Staff Committee held meetings yesterday and today to discuss the plan to organize an international gendarmerie. Today, due to continued Soviet opposition, hopes for reaching an agreement on some basic principles have been abandoned. The opinions of China, Britain, France, and the United States are consistent. The main disputes reportedly include how to use the international gendarmerie base, what form the five powers' donations should take, and how to withdraw troops after the end of the emergency period.</p>
<h3>American Fleet Exercises in the Aegean Sea</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ankara, 25th] According to the Anatolian News Agency: The American fleet, including three cruisers, six destroyers, and the 27,000-ton aircraft carrier "Leyte," sailed from the United States and rendezvoused at the port on the northwest coast of Crete, a Greek island in the eastern Mediterranean. They have begun large-scale exercises in the entire Aegean Sea between Turkey and Greece. This exercise by the American fleet has a demonstrative nature against the Soviet Union and is also a moral support for Turkey and Greece.</p>

<h3>The Social Affairs Bureau Announces a Shocking Hoarding Case; 180,000 Bags of Sugar Seized; Stored in Four Warehouses Belonging to Sixty Firms; Ordered to Sell on the Market, Prices to be Evaluated</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau announced yesterday the process of thoroughly investigating a shocking case of hoarding Peruvian sugar, amounting to as many as 187,286 bags. However, because sugar was listed as an item subject to crackdown on hoarding only after the Social Affairs Bureau issued a notice on April 25th, and the hoarding of the sugar occurred in January of this year, the Social Affairs Bureau only imposed the penalty of selling on the market, with the price to be determined at a meeting of the sugar subcommittee of the Price Evaluation Committee.</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau received a tip at the beginning of this month, claiming that a large amount of sugar was stored in the Ewo Packing Company in Tilanqiao, the Xinyi Company warehouse at the Gonghexiang Wharf, the Shanghai Warehouse on Dongda Road, and the warehouse on Shanghai Zha Road. Director Wu then instructed Bureau officials Zhu Baohe and Zhu Baoheng on April 11th to investigate the amount of sugar stored, the names of the stored shops, and the types of sugar. It was found that there were 75,970 bags of Xinyi Company's secretarial sugar stored in warehouses 7, 9, 17, and 28 of the Gonghexiang Wharf. They were stored on January 11th of this year, originally totaling 100,000 bags, which were ordered by the Xinyi Company on behalf of Junyi and 40 other companies. When the goods arrived, all the bills of lading were distributed, and each firm could directly pick up the goods from Gonghexiang with the bill. As for the daily shipment records of Gonghexiang, only Xinyi Company was recorded, and not the name of the sugar shop. Therefore, it was very difficult to ascertain the exact number currently stored by each firm. It was also found that the Ewo Packing Company, located at 1056 Yangshupu Road, stored 80,360 bags of Melun foreign firm's Peruvian sugar, which were stored in February of this year, originally totaling 101,274 bags. This sugar was ordered by the foreign firm on behalf of Changxing and 27 other companies, and the delivery procedure was the same as that of Xinyi Company. It was also found that 29,056 bags of Changxing's Peruvian sugar were stored in the Shanghai Warehouse at 1080 Dongda Road. In addition, 1,900 bags of Changxing's Peruvian sugar were also stored in the Zha Road Warehouse. The actual number currently stored in the above four warehouses totals 187,286 bags, belonging to 60 firms. Among them, Longchang, Lianhe, Zhenhua, Yuantaiheng, Jiuhua, Shengjixin, Lida, Heyuan, Fuyuan, Hexing, Dechang, Rencheng, Yuanfengheng, Yukang, Yufengheng, Li Xingji, Dasheng, Junyi, Donghe, Dadeheng, Dahua Sugar Factory, Dayiheng, Jicheng, Huihuo, Chengda, Zhenye, Changdian, Longchang, Tongshun, Yichang, Xinhe, Gongda, Yihe, Yiyuan, Hengyu, Hengyuanren, and 36 other sugar firms have all applied to the Social Affairs Bureau for business registration. Even Watson's Soda Company has also applied for company establishment registration (but is not a sugar firm). The other 23 firms, such as Lianmei, have not yet applied for sugar merchant registration. After reviewing the situation, Director Wu and Director Gu believed that the case met the provisions of Articles 7, 8, and 9 of the Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding of Important Daily Necessities During Extraordinary Times. Sugar was listed as an item subject to crackdown on hoarding only after the Social Affairs Bureau issued a notice on April 25th, and the sugar was hoarded in January of this year. It was decided that regardless of whether the owners of the sugar were merchants engaged in the main business, or merchants not engaged in the main business, or people not engaged in business, all would be handed over to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to supervise the sugar trade association to sell on the market and report to the Bureau for record.</p>
<h3>The Railways Bureau Convenes a Meeting to Review the Causes of Derailment; Believes It Was Caused by Overly Old Sleepers and Loose Ballast; Over One Million Sleepers Need to Be Replaced</h3>
<p>For the sake of future driving safety and to study the causes of the two derailments, the two Railways Bureaus convened a driving safety meeting yesterday afternoon, attended by the heads, deputy heads, and technicians of the Transportation Department, Mechanical Department, and Engineering Department. Director Chen was in Beijing on official business, and the meeting was presided over by Deputy Director and Director of the Transportation Department Hou Huahua. The meeting adjourned at about 7:00 p.m. and is scheduled to continue today. According to Deputy Director Hou's statement to reporters: At the beginning of yesterday's meeting, the causes of the derailments of the Jinling train and the Sixth Express train were studied, and explanations were given for various points criticized by the outside world; (1) The width of the current railway tracks and carriages in the United States is the same as that in China, so the addition of American carriages to the Jinling train was not the main cause of the accident. (2) Each carriage of the Jinling train can hold a weight of 18 tons. If calculated with 60 passengers, adding luggage would be only about 10 tons, so it is not related to the derailment. (3) According to facts and experience, the amount of traffic has no effect on the railway tracks, so even though the Beijing-Shanghai Railway has as many as 40 passenger and freight trains per day, it will not cause derailment. In addition to the above points, the main cause of the derailment is feared to be the excessive use of sleepers and the fact that the ballast has not been replaced for a long time, resulting in danger due to looseness. The Railways Bureau has now decided to mobilize all personnel to inspect the sleepers and ballast of the entire line. However, it is quite difficult to replace the sleepers because funding and purchasing materials are not easy. Since the restoration of the Railways Bureau, investigations have shown that over one million sleepers need to be replaced on the Beijing-Shanghai line, but only over 200,000 sleepers have been replaced so far. The Railways Bureau has truthfully reported this difficult situation and the results of yesterday's meeting to the Ministry of Communications, requesting instructions on everything. The Ministry of Communications originally intended to send personnel to attend the Railways Bureau's driving safety meeting, but due to the urgency of time, they could not arrive in time.</p>
<h3>The Police Bureau's Traffic Control Room Will Begin Service on May 1st</h3>

<h3>Over a Thousand Tricycles Demand Licenses Be Issued</h3>
<p>Appeal from Northern Jiangsu Refugees</p>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Northern Jiangsu refugees have already manufactured tricycles for business and are requesting the authorities to issue licenses to maintain the livelihoods of over 20,000 people. Yesterday afternoon, they hosted reporters at the Central Vegetable Society. According to the representatives of the refugees: over a thousand of them, along with their families, totaling over 20,000 people, are all good people from Northern Jiangsu who came to Shanghai to escape the war. Forced by livelihood, they borrowed money with interest to purchase over a thousand tricycles. They entrusted various car shops in the city to apply for donation certificates and initially entered the market without licenses to drive, barely maintaining their family's livelihood. Unexpectedly, on July 5th of last year, the municipal government issued a notice to stop issuing tricycle licenses. The car shops took the opportunity to use the provisions of the license tax law that "vehicles that have already donated and obtained licenses in other counties or cities, and pass through or stay in this county or city for no more than two months, are exempt from license tax" to donate and obtain business tricycle licenses from counties such as Baoshan and Jiading, and sell them to them at high prices to continue driving and doing business. However, the police bureau considered this a violation of orders and detained the vehicles, confiscated the licenses, and imposed heavy fines. They then realized that they had been deceived. Although they repeatedly demanded the car shops to return the license fees, they deliberately evaded and ignored their suffering. Although the government has imposed legal sanctions on them, the losses they have suffered have not yet been ordered to be compensated. Therefore, they separately petitioned the authorities, the Municipal Council, and the Tricycle Workers' Union. They also put forward six reasons, demanding that the authorities quickly issue licenses and allow them to drive in the central district to relieve the lives of these over 20,000 refugees.</p>

<h3>The Yang Ge Arms Smuggling Case, the District Prosecutor's Office Files a Public Prosecution</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] In the case of Yang Ge, a temporary pilot of the Air Transport Brigade of the Executive Yuan, smuggling arms, during the interrogation by Prosecutor Shen Zushou of the District Prosecutor's Office, the defendant confessed to the fact of smuggling arms, but claimed that the submachine gun was worth 300 US dollars given by a friend in Manila to offset his debts. The .45 caliber bullets were for the submachine gun, the .32 caliber were entrusted to him by someone, he did not know how the .30 caliber got mixed in, and the .38 caliber were for his own pistol.

<h3>An Underground Money Exchange Cracked; Private Trading of Silver Dollars; Four Criminals Arrested for Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Economic Section of the Police Bureau cracked down on an "underground money exchange" that privately operated in the black market for gold, foreign currency, and silver coins at 361 Fuzhou Road the day before yesterday afternoon. They seized 3,171 silver coins and 395 US dollars that were intended to be "delivered." Four people were arrested and sent for "delivery": Jin Daohong, Qu Qingzhai, Huang Yusheng, and Wang Fenghang. The name of the money exchange is Baohua, and the manager is Pan Zhongying from Zhenjiang, who has gone into hiding after the incident. The police bureau is currently investigating and arresting him. It was found that the Baohua Money Exchange and the Baokang Money Exchange at the intersection of Shandong Road and Zhongzheng Road are the same system, which started by purchasing nickel coins for the enemy during the occupation of the city. After the victory, they resumed their business as an "underground money exchange," operating not only in the buying and selling of gold and foreign currency but also in discounting. Since the government issued an emergency plan prohibiting the buying and selling of gold and US dollars, the money exchange and others still secretly engaged in black market transactions. The Economic Section of the Police Bureau received a report a few days ago and immediately sent personnel in disguise to wait and watch. It was not until 5:00 p.m. the day before yesterday that they were intercepted. However, due to a lack of manpower at the time, when they went to the money exchange again with the Baojia chief to inspect the accounts and safe deposit boxes, they found nothing. As for the Baokang Money Exchange's trading in black market gold, evidence has been obtained, and Chen Zhenghong, the associate manager of the exchange, was taken to the bureau for questioning yesterday.</p>
<p>Another report: According to Huang Yusheng and Wang Fenghang, who were arrested, they are working as tailors on the British warship Whiterave. The silver coins that were confiscated were intended to be taken to Hong Kong for sale. The ship sailed from Japan to Shanghai a week ago and is currently docked at the Bund and will sail to Hong Kong in a few days.</p>
<h3>The City Council Holds a Grand Tea Party to Host Party and Government Leaders and District Chiefs; Exchange Opinions and Discuss Matters of Offering Schools for Birthday Celebrations</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] City Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Deputy Speaker Xu Jiching, and all the councilors held a tea party at the council at 3:00 p.m. yesterday to host the heads of the municipal government and various bureaus, as well as the district chiefs of various districts and the chairmen of the district people's representative conferences, to exchange opinions on municipal affairs and discuss matters of promoting the offering of schools for birthday celebrations. About one hundred people attended. First, Speaker Pan</p>
<p>Chairman Pan</p>
<p>delivered a speech, saying: The district people's representative conferences and the elected district chiefs in various districts of the city have all been respectively organized and completed, and the foundation of democracy has been established. Today, I hope that the representatives and district chiefs of various districts will express their opinions as much as possible so that they can be adopted by the council at the third meeting to be held in mid-May. And please ask the heads of various agencies to provide policy guidelines for reference. In addition, I also hope that everyone will work together to promote the plan of offering schools for birthday celebrations, which was resolved by the council last year, and complete it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu</p>
<p>delivered a speech: (1) The spirit of cooperation between the City Council and the municipal government can be said to be the first in the country. The chairmen of the district people's representative conferences and the district chiefs are all elected by the people. I hope that the relationship between the two sides can be more harmonious. At the same time, I hope that the connection between the representative conference and the City Council can be strengthened. After the cooperation between public opinion institutions and government agencies, I believe that even in this most difficult period, we will be able to overcome any difficulties. (2) Regarding the matter of offering schools for birthday celebrations, although the Chairman has sent a telegram ordering us not to hold it, the safety of our country and the fate of the people of the whole country are entrusted to the Chairman. We commemorate his birthday and should do it automatically. On the one hand, it is for culture, and on the other hand, it is for our own children. This move should be supported together.</p>
<p>Judge Cha, the President of the Local Court</p>
<p>stated: Since the victory in Shanghai, the outstanding cases of various courts and temporary courts of various countries in the past are now being heard by the local court, so the affairs are extremely busy. I feel that the responsibility is great and the ability is limited, but judicial personnel must achieve (1) a calm mind, (2) an objective attitude, (3) an impartial opinion, and (4) a fearless spirit to handle cases.</p>
<p>Envoy Yan</p>
<p>expressed several thoughts, saying that the situation in Shanghai is complicated. In the past 100 years, it has been ruled by foreigners, and now the general public has forgotten the old morality and social order concepts. I hope to reorganize them. In addition, there are often unrest in the local area, which causes great pain to the citizens. We must also rely on the public to find ways to eliminate them. Standing in a supervisory position, I hope that the citizens, especially the City Council and the District People's Representative Conference, will often speak out. If there is any misconduct or corruption of the personnel of the municipal government agencies, they can report it to the Supervisory Office.</p>
<p>Committee Member Fang, the Chief of the Municipal Party Committee</p>
<p>hoped that the citizens would jointly build a Greater Shanghai and a New China after the government reorganization, and use the voice of the people to awaken all factions and parties who have not participated in the government, and stop making undemocratic performances, causing the people to suffer.</p>
<p>Then, Director Gu of the Education Bureau reported on promoting the matter of offering schools, hoping that the citizens would have one point of strength and do one point of strength, build schools, no matter how much or how little, just hoping to work hard for cultural work.</p>
<p>Director Zhang of the Civil Affairs Department hoped to arouse the citizens' attention to building local autonomy, and the administrative authorities should not only adopt foreign systems for local autonomy, but should implement them according to the inherent local social and economic conditions of our country.</p>
<p>District Chief Wang Jian'e, on behalf of the district people, said that what they feel most painful at present is that the people do not understand local autonomy, and the government officials in charge do not pay attention to it. They hope that the City Council will supervise, guide, and value the district Baojia army. They will work hard to offer schools for birthday celebrations, but they hope that the government's policies can satisfy the people. Subsequently, several district people's representatives and Tao Yishan, the Director of the Inspection Office of the Garrison Headquarters, also spoke one after another. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Shen Fenggang, the Director of the Pseudo-Special Service Headquarters, Tried; Recounts the Process of Sanctioning Pseudo-Officials; An Ugly Boasting Posture; Chen Gongshu Called as a Witness</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Shen Fenggang, who once served as the Director of the Third Division of the Pseudo-Special Service Headquarters and the Captain of the First Special Task Force, was tried in the High Court yesterday, and Chen Gongshu, the former Director of the Shanghai District of the Military Intelligence Bureau, who was in custody, was called to court to testify. Shen wore a blue cloth robe and smiled, confessing: I was arrested by "76" on August 7, 1939, and was ordered to join the pseudo-organization. On September 3, I was appointed as the Director of the Third Division of the Pseudo-Special Service Headquarters.</p>
<p>A Shot to the Bald Head</p>
<p>He then recounted the process of sanctioning pseudo-officials in an ugly boasting posture, claiming that there were two cases of arson that he had handled, (1) Wang Yongkui, the intelligence director of the "Shanghai Municipal Government" during the pseudo-Reformed Government, (2) Geng Jiaki. He opened a room at No. 1 Zhimeilou on Simalu. When he sent guests out at night, I fired a shot at his bald head, and he fell down in response. The bodyguard next to him was about to draw his gun, but was shot down by my subordinates. I saw that Wang's body was still wriggling, so I added another shot to his chest and then left. This case was reported to Chen Mo, the leader of the Second Action Team of the Military Intelligence Bureau's Shanghai District, and Chen then reported it to Chen Gongshu, who was the Shanghai District Director at the time.</p>
<p>The Surname Was Dian, The Merchant Was Jingchu</p>
<p>Chen Gongshu was then called to testify. Chen was short and capable, wearing a black cloth short jacket and gray cloth pants. He was originally the Director of the Shanghai District of the Military Intelligence Bureau. After being captured by "76," he defected and joined the pseudo-organization. He was initially sentenced to death by the military tribunal, but later the sentence was reduced to twelve years for meritorious service in catching traitors. He is currently imprisoned in Shanghai Prison. He seemed to be full of emotion when he appeared in court yesterday, testifying that "I did not know Shen Fenggang. I only met him once at the racecourse in 1945. Shen claimed to know me. There was a case of sanctioning Wang Yongkui. I was ordered by the Military Intelligence Bureau to carry it out. Chen Mo reported it to me afterwards, but I can't remember the name of the person who sanctioned him." At this point, the hearing was adjourned and changed to a later date for further investigation. The defendant and witness were both returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Disputes in the Civil Shipbuilding Industry, Both Sides Almost Came to Blows During Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The labor-capital dispute in the civil shipbuilding industry has been dragging on until now and has not been resolved. According to the labor side, the workers in the industry are divided into Ningbo and Shanghai gangs, totaling about 1,000 people. Usually, due to rain and other reasons, there are only ten or more days of work per month. The basic salary of employees was previously stipulated in the minutes signed by both parties on March 15th of last year. Now, the capital side intends to reduce wages in addition to not paying the difference due to the sluggish business. Only about 200 workers are currently working, and the rest have changed careers or returned to their hometowns, waiting for work to arrive in the summer and autumn seasons. The workers are now demanding that the capital side provide meals during the shutdown period and allow each person to advance 100,000 yuan to maintain their livelihood. In addition, they also demanded to rush to resume work. The Social Affairs Bureau continued to convene discussions on the case yesterday. The two sides disagreed and almost came to blows, and the negotiations were interrupted. It will be rescheduled for further discussion.</p>

<h3>Training Talents, Building Wooden Boats: Fishery Management Office Undertakes Two Initiatives to Develop Our Fishery Industry</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Renlin, the director of the Executive Yuan's Fishery Management Office on Fuxing Island, who took office last month, has decided to prioritize the training of fishery personnel, so that they will be able to operate new-style fishing vessels and develop our nation's fishery industry on a large scale in the future.</p>
<p>According to Wang, in addition to Shanghai, the office will establish four other locations in Taiwan, Qingdao, Guangdong, and near the Dinghai Zhoushan Islands. The Taiwan branch has already been established, and seven fishing vessels have been dispatched there. Three fishing vessels have also been sent to Qingdao. A vessel is scheduled to be sent to Guangdong at the beginning of next month, and the location near Zhoushan can be established soon as well. This measure will prevent all fishing vessels from being concentrated in Shanghai, while also enabling local training of personnel. Fishery personnel in different regions have different languages, customs, and familiarity with the water, so it is not appropriate for them all to come to Shanghai. At the same time, the office has drafted measures for companies in various industries to send technical personnel for training, and this work will be promoted next week. Because the ownership of the office's current fishing vessels still belongs to the UNRRA, it is necessary to have personnel who can reliably operate the new-style fishing vessels, so that they can be allocated to various fishery companies. The office will provide food, lodging, and miscellaneous expenses for the trainees. The training period is nine weeks.</p>
<p>The second important task of the office, according to Wang, is building wooden boats. UNRRA has provided the office with a total of 35,000 tons of wood, of which two-fifths (14,000 tons) have already arrived, along with other accessories. Therefore, the office plans to build 5,000 new wooden boats and repair 3,500 old wooden boats. The new boats will be distributed according to the needs of coastal areas and the numbers before the war, and materials for repairing old wooden boats will be free of charge, with only labor costs subsidized. Measures will be established, and applications can be submitted by fishermen's cooperatives upon reporting the quantity. This work can begin in mid-May.</p>
<p>Existing Fleet of Over One Hundred Vessels Makes Trips of Three Weeks Round Trip</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter visited the Fishery Management Office on Fuxing Island and was given a tour of the fishing vessels. Director Wang, along with administrative advisor Naxi, the UNRRA representative, and Deputy Director Wang Yikang, hosted the reporter and reported on the recent situation of the office. Zhuang Qianding, the distribution director, accompanied the tour. It was reported that the office currently has 34 American fishing vessels, 47 Australian vessels, and over 160 other auxiliary vessels. Each British fishing vessel weighs about 140 tons and is equipped with the latest type of water depth sounder, direction indicator, and radio equipment for communication with fishing stations and other vessels. The vessels also have electric refrigerators for storing food for the crew. Artificial ice is placed in the fish storage holds to keep the fresh fish from spoiling for ten days. Each vessel carries a Chinese or foreign captain (responsible for navigation), a mechanic, a general affairs officer, and trained technical personnel, totaling about fourteen people.</p>
<p>The money earned from selling the fish caught by the office is used to cover some of the expenses on the vessel, and the remainder is divided among the Chinese and foreign personnel as bonuses, in addition to their salaries. The base salary for Chinese fishermen ranges from 40 to 70 yuan per month.</p>

<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Holds Investigation Meeting on the Shanghai-Lanzhou Plane Crash</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Shanghai-Lanzhou route flight 141 crashed on the morning of the day before yesterday, five minutes after taking off from Longhua Airport, when the left engine suddenly malfunctioned, forcing the plane to make an emergency landing, veering off the end of the runway, killing three civilians, two men and one woman. Upon hearing the news in Nanjing, the director of the Civil Aviation Administration, Dai Anguo, immediately came to Shanghai to investigate the truth. Yesterday morning, Dai, along with the director of the administration's Shanghai office, Lin Jixin, and several aviation technicians, accompanied Wang Renai and Alison from the CNAC's aircraft engineering group, as well as deputy director Chen Hongen and other relevant personnel from the company, to the site of the accident at Longhua Airport to inspect and investigate. They also presided over an aircraft accident investigation meeting convened by CNAC to study the cause of the accident and determine responsibility. The meeting ended in the evening. According to Dai, the results of the investigation need to be compiled before they can be released, and he himself will remain in Shanghai for several days.</p>

<h3>Verdict in the Ximo Road Fire Case: Shang Zhikui and Two Others Sentenced to One and a Half Years Each; Public Endangerment and Theft Charges Not Accepted</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The case involving twenty-three firefighters suspected in the Ximo Road fire, after being prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office on charges of banditry, public endangerment, and theft, has undergone several hearings at the District Court, and the verdict was announced yesterday. The main text of the judgment for the banditry charge reads: "Shang Zhikui, Dai Guangrong, and Li Chengjun are each sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for theft during the fire. The remaining charges are dismissed. Cai Zhiying is found not guilty. The accused are permitted to post a written bond of 5 million yuan during the appeal period to suspend detention." Regarding the charges of public endangerment and theft, "Huang Baoqi, Li Xun, Zhu Qinglan, Zhao Rongchen, Huang Keqin, Liu Jihan, Wang Zhensan, Yang Abao, Zhou Zunwu, Wang Songqing, Tang Changsheng, Yang Qingshan, Luo Qing, Gu Fugen, Wang Zhongxiu, Wang Fengan, and Li Ashan are all found not guilty. Zhou Yuehuan and Liu Lianbi are deceased, and the prosecution is not accepted." The reasons for the judgment by Judge Merrell are as follows: The prosecutor argued that the defendants, Huang Baoqi and others, by watching the fire spread without attempting to extinguish it, were tantamount to arson and should be held responsible for public endangerment. However, at the time, the fire was extremely intense, and the glass had already melted, causing the fire to spread horizontally. Numbers 27 and 29 were also affected. According to the testimonies of witnesses and others, there were many reasons for the spread of the fire, which cannot be attributed to a small number of defendants. Regarding the theft charges, although the defendants had entered and exited the affected households at numbers 27 and 29, there was no evidence of a crime, so it would be difficult to impose criminal penalties. Many firefighters were present to observe the trial, and upon hearing the verdict, they were overjoyed. The major fire case that caused a sensation at the time has thus come to an end.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Issues Circular to Schools in Mongolia Directing Them to Pay Attention to the Task of Educational Rehabilitation; Allocates 100 Million Yuan Each in Subsidies to the Four Regions of Jehol, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Liaoning</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] In addition to establishing the Jehol-Chahar-Suiyuan-Liaoning Mongolian Education Committee for the rehabilitation of education in Mongolia, the Ministry of Education has issued a circular instructing schools in Mongolia to independently rehabilitate based on local human and financial resources, with the goal of being able to maintain themselves on a regular basis. The Ministry will only provide appropriate guidance. Regarding funding, subsidies will be awarded according to regulations based on genuine rehabilitation. Recently, it has been found that many schools and even the Committee believe that the rehabilitation effort is entirely the responsibility of the Ministry of Education, which is inconsistent with the original intention of establishing a guidance institution. Therefore, an order has been issued to reiterate the points to be noted in the relevant rehabilitation tasks: (1) The 100 million yuan in rehabilitation subsidies previously allocated to the Committee by the Ministry of Education must be spent in a verified and conscientious manner, without any extravagance or waste. At a time when the national treasury is strained and strict austerity measures are being implemented, there will be no increase beyond the original amount allocated. (2) At the beginning of school rehabilitation in Mongolia, it is necessary to first consider whether local security is guaranteed and whether financial resources and equipment can be fully self-funded. The Committee must also consider these factors when approving subsidies. (3) Education is a long-term undertaking, and short-term success should not be sought. If the conditions for rehabilitation cannot be met for the time being, recovery should be pursued gradually. Hasty action should be avoided, and actual conditions should be taken into consideration. (4) If the number of students is insufficient for a rehabilitated school that meets the conditions, the principle of merging schools or adding classes should be adopted. There is no need to greedily seek a large number of schools, which would only increase the burden of dispersing human and financial resources. The above points have been instructed to local people in Mongolia to understand the difficulties together and handle matters conscientiously.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The Ministry of Education is strongly promoting the rehabilitation of education in Mongolia. It has allocated 100 million yuan each in subsidy funds to the four regions of Jehol, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Liaoning, and instructed each region not to focus too much on the number of schools but to concentrate human and material resources to strengthen the faculty and equipment of existing schools.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] The Ministry of Education has historically provided subsidies to public and private border education institutions in various remote provinces and Mongolia. This year, due to fiscal reforms, local finances are reportedly experiencing particular difficulties, and border education undertakings will inevitably be affected. Therefore, the Ministry has allocated border education coordination funds according to the complexity and performance of border education operations in each border province and Mongolia. The amounts range from 10 million to 30 million yuan and will be distributed by the education departments, the Mongolian Education Rehabilitation Committee, or the special banner government for overall coordination.</p>
<h3>Anhui High School Graduation Examination to Implement Modified Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Hefei Dispatch] The Anhui Education Department has been approved by the Ministry of Education to exempt junior high school graduates from provincial-level examinations in order to alleviate the economic burden on students due to recent transportation inconveniences and high travel expenses. Modified measures will also be implemented for high school graduation examinations. Examinations will be held for those who meet one of the following conditions: (1) those in the provincial capital and major ports, (2) those in the same location with more than three high schools, (3) those within 50 kilometers with convenient transportation that allows for same-day round trips. High school students in other areas with inconvenient transportation will also be exempted from examinations. Graduation certificates will be stamped with the words "Approved by the Ministry of Education for Examination Exemption" upon reporting to the Education Department. The Education Department estimates that there will be 2,718 high school graduates in Anhui Province this semester and has decided to select the seven students with the best results for recommendation to the universities of their choice, limited to three locations. A circular will be issued to all secondary schools within the next few days for compliance.</p>

<h3>Shanxi Awaits Rescue from Book Famine</h3>
<p>Special Plane Flies to Beiping to Transport Books</p>
<p>[Taiyuan Dispatch] Shanxi has long felt the pinch of a book famine. This spring, Commander-in-Chief Yan specially consulted with the Zhengzhong Book Company to establish a branch in Taiyuan. Due to difficult transportation between Beiping and Jin, making book transport impossible, three special planes were dispatched to Beiping to transport textbooks printed in Beiping by the Seventh Associated Publishing House to Shanxi. Fortunately, the book famine problem has been resolved. Recently, the Ministry of Education adopted an open policy regarding the copyright of national standard editions, ordering the Shanxi Provincial Government to find its own way to print and supply them. The Shanxi authorities believe that this piecemeal supply method will inevitably lead to an even more severe book famine. Therefore, they have again consulted with Zhengzhong, Commercial Press, and Zhonghua Book Companies, requesting them to continue to be responsible for the supply. It is reported that each branch has requested instructions from the Shanghai headquarters.</p>

Each school should submit a special report on the training of normal school students to the responsible education department within one month after the end of each academic year. Each department should, within two months after the end of each academic year, report to the Ministry for review a list of the training situation of normal school students reported by each school, with reference to the reports of the inspectors.

<h3>Hong Kong's Xingdao and Seoul Fight to a Draw in Shanghai - Fans are Crazy - Crowd Surges and Yiyuan is Trampled - Many of the 50,000 Spectators are Injured</h3>
<p>After the Hong Kong Xingdao Football Team arrived in Shanghai the night before last, it faced off against the Seoul Football Team at Yiyuan Stadium yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. Fans were awed by the reputation of both teams, and the number of spectators was estimated at over 50,000. The large stands around the stadium, the flat roof, and the roofs of the houses at the south end were all occupied by fans, an unprecedented record since the start of ball games. Long-distance fans had been standing in front of the gate of the City Sports Center as early as 1 p.m., waiting to buy tickets. The gate of Yiyuan was rushed and broken by the crowd at around 2:30 p.m. More than 20 people were injured in the surge. Two of them were discovered and sent to Guangci Hospital. One was Wang Wei, 23 years old, with serious chest and head injuries. The other had minor injuries. His name was Shen Huixiang, 17 years old, and he was discharged from the hospital for recuperation after treatment. In addition, there were many cases of clothing being torn or shoes and socks being trampled off. The reporter witnessed a Western child wearing a gabardine suit. When he was squeezed out of the crowd, his trousers had turned into shorts, as the two trouser legs had long been trampled to shreds by others.</p>
<p>The game was originally scheduled to start at 4 p.m., but the bamboo fences around the stadium collapsed, and the audience poured into the inner circle of the stadium, causing chaos. With the efforts of armed police, voluntary police from the Chujiawan Police Station, and military police, the game was barely started at 4:35 p.m. However, it was disrupted by some fans again in less than two minutes. Finally, the red police car of the security police brigade arrived at the scene to suppress the disturbance. The police jeep drove into the stadium, and the armed personnel cooperated closely. The crowd gradually dispersed, and the game was restarted at 5:20 p.m. However, the original referees Chen Jixiang, He Chunhui, and Huang Renyi were not present, and Shen Huichun was temporarily appointed as the referee, with Yu Hengzhi and Li Ning as linesmen. Because it was already late, the upper and lower halves of the game were played for 30 minutes each. The result was a 0-0 tie.</p>

<p>After the kickoff, Seoul launched the first attack, with Lim Chang-sik and Jeong Nam-sik working together. "Left-foot King" stood alone, dealing with the situation calmly. Zhang Jinhai dribbled the ball quickly, passing it to the left corner. Cao Qiuting countered with a lob shot, which was saved by Che Chunjong for a corner kick. Qiuting took the corner kick, and the landing point was excellent. Park Gyu-jeong headed to clear the danger, and the ball fell to the center. Li Zhaorong was waiting and swept it with his foot, hitting the crossbar and bouncing out. Che Chunjong was covered in cold sweat. Before long, Seoul launched a full-scale attack. Xu Jingcheng retreated to defend the third team guard, and Hou Rongsheng was resourceful, heading and kicking, busy in defense. Seoul's attack failed, giving Xingdao a chance to counterattack. Fortunately, the defense was tight, and there were no mistakes. The first half ended soon after. The score was 0-0, with no clear winner.</p>
<p>Switching sides, both teams kept their original lineups. Xingdao launched a general attack. Led by Zhang Jinhai, the five forwards advanced together, with Cao Qiuting and He Yingfen flying on both wings. Li Zhaorong secretly launched cold arrows, and Kim Gyu-hwan headed the ball to defuse the danger. Seoul took the opportunity to attack, with Kim Yong-sik, Jeong Nam-sik, and Lim Chang-sik using triangular passes to launch a large-scale attack. Woo Jeong-hwan broke through an opening and hooked the ball from the baseline, but Yu Yaode jumped up and caught it, escaping the danger. The two sides fought fiercely for a long time, and the time was up, with no goals scored, resulting in a tie.</p>

<h3>Mayor's Cup Basketball Finals - Columbus Defeats Hualian - A Goal in the Last 20 Seconds Decides the Victory</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] In the Mayor's Cup basketball final last night, Columbus scored a goal by Bluechi in the last 20 seconds to win the Mayor's Cup with a score of 60-58. In the first half, Hualian was ahead by two points with a score of 31-29.</p>
<p>Due to the disturbance in the Yiyuan football game, the organizers originally planned to postpone the game, but after notifying the teams, it was difficult to change, so it was held as scheduled, with no fewer than 4,000 spectators.</p>
<p>Columbus's Xu Jineng was able to attack and defend and scored 26 points alone, which can be called one of the best performances by Chinese and Western players last night. Bluechi's quick movements were unbelievable, and Lin Hua and Da John were also highly meritorious.</p>
<p>Hualian was supported by five tigers from beginning to end, fighting hard to the end. In contrast, the opponent used an eight-man rotation, waiting for work. A difference of one goal is not a crime of war.</p>
<p>The game started at 7:25 p.m. Columbus's Bluechi and Xu successively scored two goals, Hualian was surprised and called a timeout, and Da John followed with a goal, making it six points. Hualian relied on Chen Xuesong to score in the basket, and Chen, Wu, Bao, and Kong became excited and scored frequently. However, the momentum of both sides was strong, and soon they were ahead by 10-9. Cheng Zhang made one free throw and one shot, tying the score at 12 points. Xuesong scored two goals, surpassing by two points with 16-14. Columbus replaced Beina and Tuo with Lin Hua, and also asked to rest temporarily to discuss tactics again. Both sides were too nervous, and Kong and Li missed two free throws, but Bluechi scored two goals in an instant, and Hualian fell behind by two points. Then they got a good pass, and Xuesong tied the score at 18. The two sides fought fiercely, and the difference was always within one point. Finally, Hualian led by two points with 31-29 in the first half.</p>
<p>In the second half, Wu Chengzhang took the lead, shooting from far away again, and Xu equalized with one goal, 35-31. Da and Xiao John each scored one goal, tying the score at 35. Kong Bao increased the score to 38, and Columbus once again surpassed by one point (40-41). Soon Hualian had an advantage of 44-43 and 51-46. Tuo Lin Hua transferred Xiao John, and after Tuo came on the scene, his sharpness was greatly revealed, changing the situation to a 54-54 tie. Bluechi scored one goal, and Columbus was two points ahead. With great difficulty, Zhenzhong tied the score, and Tuo Lin Hua, Chengzhang, and Bluechi successively scored, and Columbus decided the game with 60-58 in the last 20 seconds.</p>

<h3>Scraps from the Basketball Sidelines</h3>
<p>The Mayor's Cup basketball tournament for men's teams has come to a successful conclusion: Hualian and Columbus fought the final battle last night, and Hualian unfortunately lost the championship in the final moments by a difference of one goal.</p>
<p>Hualian's use of Kong Guangyi and abandonment of Ren Xiangcheng was a miscalculation. Kong is good at long-range shooting, but his speed and movement are not as good as Xiangcheng's. The game in the first half was a competition of strength and speed. Lao Kong's movements were obviously slow compared to the other nine people. When the ball was in his hands, there was almost no way to pass it out, and there was no chance to aim for a long-range shot.</p>
<p>In the first half, both teams focused on offense. All five players of Columbus had formidable stamina and speed. Hualian was obviously using the wrong strategy at this time, competing with the opponent for strength, speed, and shooting. After the strength was exhausted, although they switched to slow attacks and short passes in the second half, they had already suffered a great loss. If they had always used the strategy of the second half, it would have been a different situation.</p>
<p>I believe that the above two points are the main reasons for Hualian's failure last night. In addition, Columbus's shooting skills are improving day by day; they are also gradually familiar with the strategy against the Chinese team, which is also a necessary condition for victory.</p>
<p>Da Li's body after illness was unable to subdue Xu's activity. Da Li temporarily changed his tactics from defense to offense, and scored five goals - breaking Da Li's own record in recent years. Xuesong was steady, and A-di was too greedy for credit, and there were several times when he should not have shot but did. Lao Bao has done his best.</p>
<p>When fighting a team of similar strength, Hualian still inevitably falls into a state of psychological panic, especially Lao Bao and A-di. (Changnian)</p>

<h3>National Federation of Industries Petitions the Import Management Committee Yesterday - The Results of the Negotiations Were Very Satisfactory</h3>
<p>President Zhang Largely Agreed with All Points</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Industrial representatives Qian Xiangbiao, Hong Nianzu, Tian Heqing, Dong Hefu, Xi Zhengxiu, Yang Liren, and six others, accompanied by Wu Yun Chu, chairman of the National Federation of Industries, went to the Central Bank around 11 a.m. yesterday to petition the Import Management Committee. President Zhang personally received them and answered the representatives' requests as follows: (1) Regarding the allocation of import quotas, the relevant trade associations should first consult on the principles and values, and then the Department of Industry and Commerce Guidance and the Federation of Industry and Commerce should organize review opportunities and jointly agree on a point. Zhang expressed his agreement. (2) Regarding the request to import necessary raw materials, accessories, and production equipment, Zhang asked the representatives: If you get low-priced official foreign exchange, will the finished products be sold at a lower price in the future? Representative Tian Heqing replied: Manufacturers only seek legitimate profits and will never seek exorbitant profits from cheap raw materials. As for the determination of the selling price of finished products, we are willing to adopt a negotiated pricing system. Wu Yun Chu also stated on the spot that since the implementation of the quota system, the price of raw materials has increased tenfold, while the price of finished products has only doubled. Therefore, manufacturers are in great pain, so they hope that raw materials can directly enter the hands of producers in the future. After listening, Zhang expressed great sympathy and hoped that the Federation of Industry and Commerce could do more investigation and statistics on this. (3) Regarding the request to prohibit unnecessary finished products, he expressed sympathy and asked the Federation of Industry and Commerce to provide a detailed list so that it could be forwarded to the Import Management Committee for handling. (4) Regarding the request to increase quotas, Zhang said that he was willing to accept the opinions of the industrial community, but because the government's foreign exchange holdings are limited, it may be difficult to satisfy everyone. (5) Regarding the handling of overseas orders before February 17, Zhang said that each factory should solve it individually. The representative also proposed that each factory export its finished products abroad to earn foreign exchange and add production machinery to the factory. Zhang expressed his strong support.</p>
<p>Regarding the industrial loan portion, the delegation did not propose specific figures for increasing industrial loans; Zhang accepted the request to increase industrial loans and for each association to conduct a preliminary review of the loans; Regarding the request to increase the number of review committee members, Zhang agreed to increase the number by four or five and asked the Federation of Industry and Commerce to work with the associations to nominate them. Also, the Federation of Industry and Commerce has scheduled to convene a general meeting of members on Tuesday of last week to report on the petition process.</p>
<h3>Mayor Calls Rice Merchants for Talks - New Price Limit Set for White Rice - Retail Price of 168,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Mayor Wu convened rice industry representatives again yesterday morning to discuss and set a new price limit. It is stipulated that starting today, the retail price of white rice shall not exceed 168,000 yuan, and the market transaction price shall not exceed 160,000 yuan. Violators will be severely punished. It is reported that the government has ordered a total of about 170,000 tons of Saigon rice, a portion of which, about 20,000 tons, will arrive in Shanghai within days. The China Trust Bureau will allocate the rice to the municipal government for the exclusive purpose of regulating the food supply for Shanghai residents. The authorities have full confidence in suppressing rice prices in this city.</p>
<p>The arrival of goods in both the northern and southern markets yesterday was almost nonexistent, with only 295 stones in total. The Social Affairs Bureau still released 9,000 bags of rice. After the simplified procedures for withdrawing rice from the allocation system, the daily delivery of rice from the warehouses has reached 12,000 bags in the past two days.</p>
<p>The flour market is scarce and sells briskly, rising by more than a thousand yuan. Trade in iron filings is very active, stepping up by two or three thousand yuan. Soybean cake continues to add more than a thousand yuan. Soybeans are in strong demand and supply, with 10,000 bags already arriving from the Northeast, and prices are expected to rise. Broad beans are being vigorously absorbed from Southeast Asia, and high-quality goods continue to rise by two or three thousand yuan, while medium-quality goods are fair. Horse beans are a rare commodity and can be hoarded, soaring by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Red beans are being purchased from South China, and prices are rising steadily, adding another six or seven thousand yuan. The supply and demand of red sorghum are scarce, without any ups and downs. Foreign companies are still keenly purchasing sesame seeds and kernels, making steady progress and continuing to rise by three to five thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil Soars</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Edible oil prices continued to soar yesterday, with soybean oil hitting a new high of 510,000 yuan, barrel peanut oil at 488,000 yuan, and Jeep barrel peanut oil at 535,000 yuan. Regarding oil pressing raw materials, market prices remained firm. Soybeans were priced at 159,000 yuan per dan, Hankou and Zhazha beans at 140,000 yuan, and Guide peanuts at 269,000 yuan per Lao Zu.</p>
<p>Industry insiders analyzed the reasons for the continuous rise in oil prices in recent days: (1) In the past, our country signed agreements for the export of edible oil and raw materials, and the amounts were quite large. Recently, they have been shipped out one after another. (2) Recently, the black market foreign exchange has soared, and the trend of smuggling raw materials for oil extraction has also become rampant. (3) The production of oil by each factory is restricted by negotiated prices, and the price of raw materials is rising daily, so the production volume is shrinking daily. (4) It is rumored that the Logistics Department has recently purchased soybeans in Bengbu, Hankou, Xuzhou, and other places, which has a significant impact on the supply of raw materials.</p>
<h3>Man-made Silk Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>The price of rayon rose again in the city yesterday. After the opening price of No. 120 Takayama Yuki was called 1.9 million yuan, people were extremely excited, and the price rose slowly but surely. The closing price at noon was 2.3 million yuan. It was re-priced in the afternoon, with a call price of 3 million yuan for weekly bills. As a result, it rose by another million yuan compared to the previous day. The call price of No. 75 Golden Rooster Semi-gloss also rose by one million yuan, but there were no transactions. Transactions by factories were very rare. Yesterday, the call prices were uniformly increased, with each grade rising by six or seven million yuan. Yesterday, only five dan of D-grade Takayama Yuki were sold in spot transactions, with a price of 15 million yuan. There were no other transactions. Because the price of raw materials has risen, the call prices for silk fabrics have all increased by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, but there were no transactions. Dachun checkered crepe opened at 26,200 yuan and transactions were made immediately, and then it rose to 400 yuan. Although there were no shortages of selling at high prices, call prices continued to rise, and the closing price was 6,700 yuan. Weekly bills opened at 7,000 yuan, and the spot price rose by about 1,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Stable Cotton Cloth Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Spinning and Weaving Company sold various cloths as usual. The price limit policy has been changed to a flexible management approach, which has revitalized the market transactions. Two types of grey cloth were offered. Blue Crane fine cloth was limited to the dyeing and weaving industry, priced at 218,000 yuan. Another 20-count extra fine cloth was listed at 159,000 yuan, distributed to dealers by number. Within the market, Dragon Head fine cloth was priced at 255,000 yuan, Five Blessings at 245,000 yuan, 20-count extra fine cloth at 200,000 yuan, and Basket Chicken at 240,000 yuan. Other colored cloths and shirting remained largely unchanged. Four Gentlemen drill cloth initially opened at 224,000 yuan, and retail buyers, seeing the low price, replenished their stocks, pushing the price up to 228,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Buying Side Holds the Advantage, Chinese Stocks Rise Again</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks advanced again yesterday, but the rise was mainly driven by miscellaneous and new stocks, so the increase was relatively moderate. Funds from the yarn and cloth sector continued to seep in, forcing Jiemian financiers to replenish their positions near the close. New buying from northern financiers joined in, but the limited supply from money exchange financiers and young financiers was still insufficient to reverse the oversupply. The market opened high in the morning. Jinglun continued to hit the limit up due to opening too low. After the opening, Di Yong Yarn No. 1, 2, 65, 224, 117, 154, 83, and 217 were bought up, and Innerwear No. 97, Matches No. 224, etc., were the first to hit the limit up, rising to 4840 yuan. No. 97, 223, 14, 183, and 125 sold at higher prices, dropping to 4760 yuan. No. 106, 185, 224, 94, 89, and 145 entered again, and Tongyi, Rongfeng, Wuhe, Huafeng, and Xinya all hit the limit up, rising to 4900 yuan. Jiufu also hit the limit up, and No. 14, 153, 48, 4, and 83 exited, dropping to 4830 yuan. Commerce also hit the limit up. No. 105, 231, 107, 160, 142, 153, 223, 89, 153, 117, and 94 came to buy, and near noon, it rose to a new high of 4980 yuan. No. 218, 137, 89, and 197 still supplied, falling back to 4850 yuan. No. 76 and 56 continued to support, and retail investors rushed to replenish their positions, raising Di Yong Yarn to 4920 yuan at the close. The market was flat after the close. Compared to the previous close, Huafeng hit the limit up, Sino-French, Xinhua, Meiya, and Yonggong each rose by 10%, Xinyong and Di Yong Yarn rose by a strong 5%, Jingfu rose by a weak 5%, and Xinguang rose but not much. For late delivery, Di Yong Yarn, Xinyong, and Meiya each rose by about 5%, Yonggong rose by 10%, Huafeng hit the limit up. Among the cold stocks, Sino-French, Commerce, China Textile, Tongyi, Rongfeng, Matches, Jinglun, Wuhe, Jiufu, Xinya, and Innerwear all hit the limit up. National Goods and Datong Cement each rose by about 10%, and China Silk only rose slightly. The rise in off-market stocks was even stronger.</p>
<h3>Few Transactions in Unified Bonds</h3>
<p>Public bonds were stable yesterday. Rooms 512 and 360 had deliveries, while Room 556 sold. Unified Bond C opened at 14,200 yuan in the morning, with a high of 14,600 yuan, a low of 13,600 yuan, and finally struggled outside of 14,000 yuan. The final result was a drop of 200 yuan from the previous close for all prices, with a turnover of only two to three million yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Initially Flat, Then Strong</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks were initially flat but then strong yesterday. Funds from the yarn and cloth sector were active. New buying was seen from northern financiers, Guang financier also joined, and retail investors mostly liquidated, mainly because the Hong Kong exchange rate was very stable. Reports of registrations in Hong Kong encouraged buyers. Yi Yarn opened at 54,500 yuan in the morning, rising from 54,300 yuan to 57,500 yuan before leveling off slightly. Smaller stocks were more active. Compared to the previous close, Yeguang, Paper, and Yi Beer each rose by about 15%, and the remaining stocks rose by 5% to a weak 10%.</p>
<h3>First Preparatory Meeting of the National Federation of Money Trade Associations</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The first preparatory meeting of the preparatory office of the National Federation of Money Trade Associations was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Shanghai Money Trade Association headquarters. Fourteen representatives from Shanghai, one from Nanjing, and two from Chongqing attended. Chairman Shen Rixin presided over the meeting, which adjourned around 6:00 PM. There were two important proposals: (1) Referring to the articles of association of the National Banking Association and the National Insurance Association, the articles of association of the National Federation of Money Trade Associations were drafted, discussed item by item, and a draft of 44 articles was completed. (2) A membership application survey form was drafted. The form is to be sent to the initiators of the Federation in Nanjing, Chongqing, Peiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Hangzhou, Ningbo, and other seven locations for consent. After consent is obtained, it will be distributed to money trade associations across the country to solicit membership. It is estimated that there will be more than 50 member firms.</p>
<p>Agreed Money Trade Association Interest Rates for This Month</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai Money Trade Association decided yesterday that the current debit interest rate for this month is 13% per annum, and the current credit interest rate is 1.8% per annum. The current debit interest rate was initially listed at 13.5% per annum at the beginning of the month, and later reduced to 12% per annum, so the agreed 13% per annum for this month is the average statistic of the listed interest rates for the entire month. The loan interest rate for fixed-term deposits and discounts other than current debit interest rates will remain at 12% per annum. It is reported that the interest rate has been approved by the Banking Association.</p>
<h3>Flour Mill Representatives List Difficulties, Mayor Wu Promises to Find Solutions</h3>
<p>Next Month's Flour Allocation to Remain at 300,000 Bags, Pricing Issues to be Discussed at Meeting Next Week</p>
<p>Five major flour mills in the city, including Fuxin, Chefeng, Huazhong, Yutong, and Xin, jointly submitted a document to Mayor Wu yesterday, stating that it would be difficult to continue supplying flour for civilian use at the current price limit for next month. They listed the following points: (1) The quantity of old wheat in producing areas is extremely limited, and new wheat has not yet entered the market. The city needs about 80,000 dan of wheat per month for the allocation of flour, and the possible purchase volume at present may be less than one-third, which is far from the required amount. (2) There are many transportation obstacles. Wheat that has been purchased in some areas, such as northern Jiangsu and Hankou, cannot be shipped to Shanghai due to unstable local conditions, lack of transportation facilities, or local bans on exports. (3) Compared to the purchase price and the cost of grinding flour, the difference per bag is as high as 40,000 yuan. Even if the China Trust Bureau distributes profit-sharing flour to subsidize losses, it will not be enough. After the representatives of the factories presented the above three points to Mayor Wu, Mayor Wu promised to find solutions within the month. For the allocation issue next month, the China Trust Bureau will increase the allocation to supplement the flour needed. The profit and loss between the cost and the allocation price will be discussed by relevant parties next week to seek a reasonable solution. The allocation quota for next month will remain at 300,000 bags, without reduction.</p>
<h3>Sales Results of US Dollar Bonds</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The New Bond Sales Committee revealed the sales results yesterday. The total amount was USD 168,900 for short-term treasury bills and USD 61,100 for US dollar public bonds, which were sold by Zhejiang Industrial, China Industrial, Xinyong, Qichang, and other firms.</p>
<h3>Few Transactions in Chinese Medicine</h3>
<p>The Chinese medicine market is experiencing rising prices in the western drug sector, causing public anxiety and making it difficult to purchase. Aucklandia costus is priced at 40,000 yuan in cash, and Bai Chuan is priced at 16,000 yuan. Although there are transactions, they are small in number. Crude fennel is priced at 1,600 yuan, and Northern Apricot is priced high at 6,000 yuan, with few transactions. Out-of-town customers are quite wary, and local additions are taking a wait-and-see approach.</p>
<h3>Brisk Foreign Tea Transactions</h3>
<p>Wenzhou's new Fine Tea was still being purchased by Yudaobang brokers yesterday, boosting market sentiment and pushing prices higher. Other varieties were sold sporadically, with little change in the process. As for the foreign tea market, Wang Yutai is focused on the purchase of last year's third lot of Keemun tea. Transactions remain strong, but the market trend is still very weak. It is understood that Wuchang Tea Company is very interested in absorbing the large batch of Pingshui tea from the 35th year, and Chenchouzhen and Jardine Matheson also have good demand. They are currently negotiating with the owners. If it can be resolved smoothly, the dying foreign tea market will receive a stimulant, and will be able to gradually recover.</p>
<h3>Credit Letter Extension Applications Should Be Submitted to the Import Control Committee for Review</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Business Bureau of the Central Bank issued Circular No. 96 to all designated banks yesterday, stating that the Executive Committee of the Provisional Import Management Committee has decided that from now on, all credit letter extension applications should be submitted by the designated banks to the relevant departments of the Import Control Committee for review based on the type of imported goods. For applications submitted before November 17, 1946, the extension matters should be handled by the Non-Quota Import Review Office. All procedures for extension applications can still be handled in accordance with the previous circulars issued by the Bank regarding extensions.</p>
<h3>China Silk Corporation Holds Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors, Last Year's Surplus Exceeds 1.3 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The fifth joint meeting of directors and supervisors of China Silk Corporation was held yesterday at 10:00 AM at the Jinmen Hotel. Directors Zhou Yichun, Pan Xulun, Ouyang Lun, Leng Jun, Chu Fucheng, Zheng Bijiang, Shao Shenpei, Tan Xihong, Ge Jingzhong, Tang Xizu, and others attended. Zhou Yichun chaired the meeting. There were four important reports: (1) Report on the company's business, (2) Report on the final accounts for the 35th year, (3) Report on the participation in the silk weaving joint venture company and the cooperative silk factory, (4) Report on the distribution of the company's surplus.</p>
<p>There were two important resolutions: (1) Review the final accounts for the 35th year. Resolution: Approved, and submitted to the Standing Committee of Supervisors for review. (2) The Ministry of Economic Affairs issued an order promulgating measures for the sale of state-owned enterprises to private enterprises, stipulating that the company should first issue 50% of its shares for public sale. However, how to increase the total assets of the company and how to issue shares is submitted for discussion and resolution. Resolution: An valuation committee will be formed first to discuss the issue of share issuance and valuation. The proposed members include two representatives from the company, private silk factories, and the Central Trust Bureau, and one representative from the Audit Department. In addition, the company's total surplus for last year was 1.38 billion yuan in national currency. 70% of this amount must be turned over to the national treasury, amounting to approximately 1 billion yuan. After deducting the direct business taxes, which total approximately 80 million yuan, the remaining amount is small. However, rumors that the company is a loss-making enterprise have been proven to be inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Sales of Hardware</h3>
<p>The hardware market has risen by about 20% this week compared to last week. Today's market price is slightly calmer, but the selling price of Kunming Brand green silk cloth is still alarming. However, the actual sales of various goods are sluggish, and the price of sheep liver lacquer has also increased.</p>
<h3>Buyers Absorb at Lower Prices, Yarn Prices Trend Higher Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market saw the authorities order each yarn number to sell existing yarn, price limits were lifted, and free trade was permitted. The market resumed trading, with 130 packages traded. The market had fallen too much the previous day, and dyeing and weaving factories absorbed at lower prices. Actual sales on the street were active, and market sentiment was firm. 42-count Blue Phoenix was quoted as high as 12.3 million, and 20-count Double Horse 6 million, a recovery of 200,000 to 800,000 compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>China Mercantile Bank Celebrates 50th Anniversary</h3>
<p>China Mercantile Bank held a 50th anniversary celebration ceremony at Lido Garden yesterday afternoon. At 2:00 PM, Chairman Du Yuesheng presided over the meeting and delivered the opening speech. Deputy Manager Luo Qinghua reported on the historical facts. Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Zhang Gongquan, Qian Xinzhi and others delivered speeches. China Electric sent a cameraman to the scene to film the event. At the same time, there was also an exhibition of the bank's cultural relics, including various banknotes and other historical documents issued by the bank, as well as a public exhibition of rare ancient coins, which was adjourned at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Lumber is Lively</p>
<p>Fir has risen sharply, and foreign pine is also following suit. Yesterday, the lumber market was very prosperous.</p>
<h3>Transportation Issues Resolved, Sichuan and Hubei Tung Oil Can Arrive</h3>
<p>Tung oil prices are weak in the foreign market, which has made it difficult for exporters, because the weakness of foreign market prices is still due to our high costs, and the key to high costs is that the transportation problem has not been resolved reasonably. The Export Association is actively trying to help. It is reported that recently, during the flood season, the association specially negotiated with the Chongqing Shipping Allocation Committee, requesting more tonnage allocation, and it is reported that agreement has been reached. It is estimated that within three months, 30,000 tons of dong oil from Sichuan and Hubei can be transported to Shanghai. The transportation problem has been resolved, and the cost of tung oil is expected to be reduced. Compared with foreign market prices, tung oil can be exported continuously in the future.</p>
<h3>Peruvian Sugar Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The former China Toaster arrived in Shanghai, carrying 40,000 bags of sugar from Peru, berthed at China Merchants Bureau Zhongzhan for unloading, and was transferred to buoys 22 and 23 yesterday.</p>
<p>Also, the Haikang wheel arrived in Shanghai from Qinhuangdao yesterday, carrying 1,910 tons of soybeans and 482 pieces of firebricks, and is currently berthed at the Jinliyuan Wharf for unloading.</p>
<h3>Wheat Supply Problems</h3>
<p>The most difficult problem currently faced by flour mills is the supply of wheat. In terms of price, Yangzhou wheat costs 105,000 yuan per dan to Shanghai. Wuxi wheat costs 115,000 yuan per dan to Shanghai. Assuming that wheat costs 110,000 yuan per dan, the cost of producing each bag of flour is 76,000 yuan. In terms of wheat quality, due to the rising prices of everything, the trend of adulteration is becoming more and more intense. Often, each dan contains 8 to 20 catties of impurities, which invisibly increases production costs.</p>
<p>According to an estimate by a flour industry magnate, the provinces of Jiangsu and Anhui can roughly harvest 6 million dan of wheat this year. At the same time, it is hoped that 4 million dan of foreign wheat will be shipped in, for a total of 10 million dan of wheat, so the flour production in Shanghai this year can reach 17 million bags. This number is barely enough to supply the consumption of flour in East China and North China. However, this number is incomparable to the pre-war period. In the pre-war period, the wheat production in northern Jiangsu alone reached more than 40 million dan per year. The flour production in Shanghai alone reached more than 30 million bags per year.</p>
<h3>Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury Revise Exchange Rates in Various Regions</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The exchange rates of the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury for remittances to various regions will be slightly revised starting from the 28th. Quanzhou is 45 yuan per 1,000 yuan (originally 30 yuan), Fuzhou is 40 yuan (originally 35 yuan), other regions in Fujian are 45 yuan (originally 35 yuan). Xuzhou is 8 yuan (originally 5 yuan). Nantong is 8 yuan (originally 6 yuan). Bengbu is 10 yuan (originally 8 yuan). Other regions in Anhui, except Wuhu, Bengbu, Tunxi, and Shexian, are 15 yuan (originally 12 yuan). Ganzhou is 10 yuan (originally 5 yuan), Jiujiang is 10 yuan (originally 8 yuan). Other regions in Zhejiang, except Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Wenzhou, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Huzhou, Haimen, and Linhai, are 20 yuan (originally 15 yuan). Xufu is 10 yuan (originally 15 yuan), other regions in Sichuan, except Chongqing, Chengdu, Xufu, and Fangxian, are 10 yuan (originally 5 yuan). Yunnan is 5 yuan (originally 2 yuan).</p>
<p>The exchange rates for other important locations will remain unchanged. Guangzhou is 75 yuan, Shantou is 80 yuan, Changsha and Hengyang are both 55 yuan, Hankou and Wuchang are both 50 yuan, Shashi and Yichang are both 55 yuan, and Tianjin, Beijing, Hangzhou, and Chongqing are all 2 yuan, and Chengdu is 5 yuan.</p>
<p>In terms of commercial firms, the exchange rate in Guangzhou is 120 yuan to 170 yuan, Shantou is 150 yuan, Hankou is 70 to 80 yuan, and Changsha is 60 to 80 yuan. The exchange rates are still expensive.</p>
<p>People from national banks said that the national banks have always maintained unchanged exchange rates for Guangdong, Shantou, Hankou, Changsha, and other places in the past two weeks, so they hope to stabilize the exchange rates of commercial firms. If commercial firms do need to remit funds for the purchase of raw materials by manufacturers, and can provide sufficient reasons and documentation, the national banks will be happy to facilitate the transfer of the large amount of funds. Moreover, the national banks also offer commercial firms a discount of 70% to 90% on the stipulated exchange rate for remittances. Commercial firms already have legitimate profits, so they hope not to raise exchange rates further to stabilize the foreign exchange market. At the same time, it is heard that the head of the domestic remittance department of the national bank is currently negotiating with the bank's issuing bureau on a proper solution to suppress the high exchange rates.</p>

<h3>French Parliament - Notes from the Gallery</h3>
<p>— Jian Hua</p>
<p>Paris, 15th (Airmail)</p>
<p>The Vietnam Issue Triggers a Great Disturbance - The Tides of the French Cabinet, From Turmoil to Calm</p>
<p>The Vietnam incident began with the Haiphong kerosene case on November 19th last year. The war spread to Hanoi, and then both North and South Vietnam became battlefields. However, neither side declared war, similar to the situation after the Lugou Bridge Incident in our country. France allowed the local garrison to act freely and the local official news agency reported exclusively to France. The news it conveyed did not seem to reflect the facts. It claimed that the Haiphong issue arose because the French inspected small Chinese boats smuggling goods, and the Vietnamese shelled them without investigation. The war in Hanoi was a planned arrangement by the Vietnamese. After receiving the Vietnamese reply agreeing to negotiations at 6 PM on December 18th, the entire city was plunged into darkness and gunfire erupted at 8 PM the next night. The news lightly omitted the first two days (December 17th) when French troops attacked the Vietnamese government and the presidential residence, occupied them after fierce street fighting, Ho Chi Minh escaped alone, and Hoang Minh Giam was seriously injured. This situation is still being concealed in Paris. As for the piles of Chinese corpses, not a word was mentioned. It was only said that the Chinese were deeply protected by the French, their property was intact, and the Chinese government repeatedly asked the French to take care of them, to prove the greatness of French power. Only the Chinese in Vietnam know the suffering.</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>The war has passed confusedly for four months. The French Parliament has repeatedly delayed discussions. It is clear that the planned military expenditure will be exhausted by the end of March, and future military expenditure must be approved by the Parliament. Therefore, discussions had to begin on the 11th of this month to determine France's policy towards Vietnam. Who would have thought that this discussion would shift from the Vietnam issue to party issues, to personnel issues, to issues of resisting Germany and collaborating with Germany, to Russia, to government organization, to the powers of the Ministry of Defense, causing the Speaker and the Prime Minister to lose face. A female member of parliament who had been sentenced to death by the Germans slapped a male member of parliament who had curried favor with the enemy and acquired property on both sides of his face. The leader of the Popular Republican Movement, Schumann, and a member of the Radical Socialist Party also got into a brawl in the meeting place because of a mocking laugh, grabbing each other's ties and refusing to let go. As for the numerous adjournments and walkouts during the discussions, that goes without saying. This is a rarely seen state of disorder in the history of the French Parliament. Even the Speaker himself said: "Sometimes reason cannot suppress emotions." Fortunately, the Speaker was an experienced Mr. Herriot, who was able to control the whole scene. From the 11th, there were six sessions of discussions over ten days. Fortunately, meetings could still be held. If it had been someone else, who knows how much worse it would have been. The detailed account of the general assembly is as follows:</p>
<p>The general assembly opened at 3 PM on the 11th. Members of parliament gathered, and the visitor and press seats were packed. The atmosphere was very tense, and everyone held their breath in silence. Herriot sat high on the Speaker's platform, and Overseas Minister Moutet led his colleagues, Sainteny and four others, sitting quietly in the front row below the platform. The first to take the stage to speak was Ramarony, a member of the far-right Republican Liberty Party. He said, "We French have built 32,000 kilometers of roads and more than 3,000 kilometers of railways in Annam for eighty years, and cultivated more than 2 million hectares of land, which shows that Vietnam needs our experience, science, and creative talent. This country is in a state of internal and external troubles. Who else will they turn to for protection in the future if not France? Only France can guide the Vietnamese people towards freedom and morality... Who knew that a few minority elements, taking a risk, would forcibly resort to arms. Therefore, we should adopt strong measures to deal with those rebels who intentionally expel French expatriates, and use gentle policies to treat the people, and maintain France's substantial interests in the Far East. All compromises and hesitant attitudes should no longer exist." After speaking, he quietly walked off the stage. Then, another member of the Republican Liberty Party, Debrun, took the stage. He hoped that the Colonial Minister's promise not to abandon Vietnam "can be realized," because only France can maintain freedom and culture in Vietnam. He clearly stated that Vietnam is not Vietnam. After speaking, his fellow party member, Andre, took the stage and continued to expound the views of the right wing. However, he deviated from the Vietnam issue and first asked a question, "Why is the Ministry of Defense headed by a communist? On the surface, it seems like a nominal cabinet seat, just filling a quota, only dealing with military needs, health, and accommodation in defense planning; in reality, all military orders must be countersigned by him before they take effect. Now it's the Vietnam incident that has expanded, causing obstacles everywhere; furthermore, the communists have always opposed military preparations. Before Hitler came to power, Thorez went to Berlin and gave a speech to German workers on January 15, 1933, opposing the occupation of the Ruhr, Saar, opposing demanding reparations from Germany, opposing the Treaty of Versailles, advocating complete independence for all oppressed colonies, and opposing all military budget estimates. Two years later (1935), Laval signed an agreement with Stalin in Moscow, and the communists changed their tune: they accepted the military budget estimates related to national defense and became the most vehement opponents of Hitler's Germany; at every meeting, before singing the Internationale, they would first sing the Marseillaise. When the Second World War was about to break out, Germany and Russia concluded the Non-Aggression Pact of August 23, 1939, and the communists jointly submitted a letter to the Speaker of the Lower House, Herriot, requesting that a treaty of friendship be signed with Germany immediately; at that time, a communist party member, Lachouette, wrote to the Prime Minister requesting to enlist in the army to fill the vacancy of the communist leader who had fled..." Just as he said this, the communist leader, the current Deputy Prime Minister, Thorez, who was sitting opposite, stood up and said, "That's not right, I didn't flee, I held firm to my position as General Secretary of the Communist Party. If you want, I can give you an explanation right now!" After speaking, the seats on the left applauded warmly, and the communist members of parliament stood up and applauded even more, for a long time. (See page 807, line 1 of the French government gazette for details.) Another member of parliament stood up and said, "Mr. Andre, if you have the courage, you should also describe how Thorez directed the Communist Party to attack and occupy the German army!" Speaker Herriot stood up and said, "Mr. Andre, I am doing my best to protect your freedom of speech, but don't talk about anything outside of today's topic. At this time of national unity, we should not waver or divide. If you continue to talk like this, I will have to announce an adjournment. Please finish your conclusion!" At this time, the meeting place was in an uproar. Herriot, seeing that it was impossible to continue, announced an adjournment. The time was exactly 6:40 PM.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>At 7:05 PM, Herriot returned to the Speaker's platform and announced the resumption. Before continuing the discussion, he said, "The conflict just now is really detrimental to the reputation of the meeting place. Mr. Andre's words were obviously outside the topic and violated Article 43 of the parliamentary rules. Now, please pay attention to the following two points: First, Mr. Andre is too accustomed to the old habits of political party struggles and has forgotten the new spirit of national unity and liberation, which is really an insult to the heroic spirits of all parties who sacrificed themselves for the country; second, Mr. Andre insulted a senior government official, the Deputy Prime Minister, and forgot that scolding is always prohibited in the French Parliament, which really gives the national public a bad impression. Moreover, Thorez has held important government positions, not just today. He was initially invited into the cabinet by General de Gaulle, who was most known for protecting national interests. Mr. Andre, I give you three minutes to finish your conclusion." Prime Minister Ramadier stood up to endorse the Speaker's opinion and said: "Crude scolding is absolutely prohibited in parliamentary discussions, because this will be despised by the French people and the world..." Before he could finish speaking, someone shouted: "There's a fight in the aisle!" It turned out that a communist female member of parliament, Mrs. Inyou Lan, who had been sentenced to death by the German army and imprisoned in a concentration camp, heard the insult to the Secretary-General of the Communist Party and, without saying a word, walked out and, when Andre came out, slapped him twice on both cheeks.</p>
<p>Everyone at this time had no idea about the battle outside the venue. The Prime Minister was still saying: "Now everyone should forget the past, unite, and share the responsibility of building the country. Sometimes we are not as good as the heroes of the past, but it is more difficult and takes more time than in the past. The courage required is no less than in wartime. Forget the small conflict just now, because insulting the enemy party is actually infringing on the public."</p>
<p>Before he could finish speaking, another member of parliament rushed to speak. Herriot allowed him, only to hear him say: "Do you all know who Andre is? It turns out that he was a specialist who, during the German occupation, idled in the German-annexed city of Anci, willing to obey French law and German military law, and to purchase Jewish houses under blockade!" After speaking, he read aloud a letter from Andre and the director of the Anci Jewish property management, Stoller, proving that Andre was an opportunist who took advantage of Hitler's sins. How could he be allowed to take the stage to speak! Herriot stood up again and warned everyone that today's debate is of paramount importance to Annam, not only is the national public looking forward to it, but foreigners are also coveting it, and the United Nations General Assembly is also reacting. He hoped that everyone would calm down. Andre was willing to sacrifice his unfinished speech for the best. Andre did not comply, and Herriot said angrily: "Alright then, but you must not deviate from the topic!"</p>
<p>Andre walked back to the stage and immediately complained, "When I walked out of the meeting place just now, I was unfortunately punched and kicked, and my manuscript was scattered all over the ground, trampled on..." The members of parliament on the left could not stop laughing. One said, "The one who hit you was a woman," another said, "She was imprisoned in a concentration camp," and another said, "She was sentenced to death by the Germans!" Andre said: "Please judge everyone, did I say anything outside of the topic?" This caused everyone to laugh out loud. He defended himself, "I was also arrested by the Germans and imprisoned..." At this time, the whole scene was in a complete mess and unable to continue. Herriot announced an adjournment, and the discussion would continue on the 13th. The time was already 7:35 PM.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>At 3 PM on the 13th, the National Assembly reconvened to discuss the Vietnam issue. Herriot first stated: "The hand-to-hand conflict the other day is absolutely unacceptable, and the responsible committee will determine the method of sanctions in detail to make up for the loopholes in Article 43 of the rules of procedure. If any representative is insulted, only the Speaker can stop it, and others must not abuse means to maintain the true face of French freedom." After speaking, he turned to the right and asked, "Mr. Andre, if you have any opinions on Vietnam, you can take the stage to speak. If it is a comprehensive political issue, it will be discussed separately on another day." Andre agreed to only discuss the Vietnam issue. After taking the stage, he criticized the inconsistency within the French government and the error of still tolerating the Vietnamese government's representatives to reside in Paris, and then stepped down.</p>
<p>At this time, another party took the stage to speak. He was Devina of the Left Alliance, a follower of former Governor-General of Vietnam, Varenne. He first stated the importance of Vietnam, such as: "The location of French sovereignty, the safety of 30,000 French expatriates, the maintenance of interests protected for fifty years, the prosperity and order of 25 million natives of different races, languages, religions, and customs, a few elements who have been influenced by Chinese and Western cultures and demand independence, resulting in famine and terror everywhere, the devastation of cities and villages, losses of up to 50 million, thousands of French expatriates dying, tens of thousands of natives disappearing, everywhere the same as in China, rural farmlands and furnaces turned into ruins, so they take risks, resulting in war causing famine, and famine deepening the war. At present, we should first distinguish between 'Vietnam' and 'Viet Minh' as two different things: Vietnam is a geographical name, including the area from Hanoi to Saigon in the three provinces east of the Mekong River; Viet Minh is a political term (the abbreviation of 'Vietnam Independence League', reporter's note), a revolutionary organization with national ideas, which was produced after the last war, founded by Ho Chi Minh. After Ho's entire family was killed by the French, he fled alone to Hong Kong at the age of twenty-five, working as a private secretary for the Russian consul. In 1930, he returned to Vietnam once, and then went to China; then he came to Europe and lived in Paris for several years, deeply influenced by revolutionary ideas, contacted patriots from various colonies together, and participated in the Moscow International Peasants' Congress, where he planned the Annam Revolutionary Youth Party with the aim of eradicating French forces and restoring Vietnam's independence. He was once detained by the British in Hong Kong and then released. When the Japanese army expelled the French on March 9th of the year, they planned to create a puppet empire but failed, and surrendered in August. Ho Chi Minh announced the independence of Vietnam at the Governor's Office in Hanoi on the 20th of the same month, with the speech as follows:</p>
<p>'For eighty years, French colonial figures, holding the tricolor flag of freedom, equality, and fraternity, have forcibly occupied our land, destroyed our nation, and violated justice and humanity. In politics, these French people do not give us any freedom, forcibly establish barbaric legal systems, adapt to local conditions, prevent the unification of our nation, build prisons on a large scale, the number of which far exceeds the schools built, and kill all patriots who love the people in a pool of blood, stifle public opinion, implement dark politics, and use opium and alcohol to demoralize our nation. Based on the above reasons, we solemnly declare to the world that the Vietnamese nation now enjoys the right to freedom and independence.' (The original text can be found on page 827 of this year's French government gazette.) Under this reasonable statement, France sent troops, and Representative Sainteny shuttled between Kunming, Hanoi, and the Chinese garrison to negotiate the agreement of March 6th last year. First, Mr. Moutet obtained permission for the Chinese army to withdraw on February 28th. I would like to express my congratulations to the Overseas Minister here. Then, 15,000 French troops arrived in Haiphong on March 5th. From March to December, French policy wavered between Paris and Saigon, let alone personnel! This resulted in three mistakes: First, poor publicity; second, administrative corruption; third, political ambiguity. The remedy: First, restore order with military force; then, occupy the important points of Vietnam, such as cities, docks, warehouses, mines, and various raw material producing areas; reassign capable personnel to replace the mediocre ones; restore the devastation of the region. It is not too late now, otherwise, if Vietnam breaks away from France, all other overseas territories will not be able to be maintained." After speaking, he stepped down. Then, former Prime Minister Reynaud, who had been defeated by the German army, took the stage, sparking an unprecedented dispute between the left and right wings of the meeting place. The Vietnamese representative to France, Dương Bạch Mai, was the sole target of his attack.</p>

<h3>Be Careful of Scams When Walking</h3>
<p>Last night (the 14th at 9:30 PM), after closing my store, I was walking home because the tram was not coming. When I reached the entrance of the sports field of Aurora University on Rue Luban, there were few pedestrians. Two people in uniform came from the opposite direction, holding a small bag, and intentionally bumped my hand, causing the bag to fall to the ground. Then I heard the sound of glass breaking. They immediately said, "You have no manners when walking!" They immediately opened the bag and saw three wireless light bulbs inside, saying they were bought from Dongxin Bridge and were worth 240,000 yuan. I knew at the time that I had encountered a scam. First, there were few pedestrians on the road, and second, I still had to work tomorrow and had cash and other items with me. I immediately said to them, "I can't afford 240,000 yuan. I only have 50,000 to 60,000 yuan with me. Can we settle it?" Under a state of intimidation and persuasion, they took the money and left.</p>
<p>Although my loss is small, I am afraid that I am not the only one who has been scammed. Therefore, I advise pedestrians to be aware of scams. (Yuan Yiliang)</p>
<h3>A Junior High School Should Be Established in Tangqi, Hang County</h3>
<p>Editor: My hometown of Tangqi is a famous giant town in the canal basin, with many students. Students who graduate from elementary school each year and aspire to further their studies must travel to the urban area of Hangzhou. Therefore, most students' parents are limited by their economic ability to cultivate their children, and some have the financial means, but suffer from the fact that the number of school places in Hangzhou is in short supply, and most are disappointed. As a result, such a large town cannot meet the cultural standards. I grew up in this area, with fertile fields and convenient water transportation, which can be called a model area for national construction. I hope that the Zhejiang education authorities will not forget this beautiful town attached to the county seat and plan to establish a junior high school, so that Hang County will not be difficult to become a model county in Zhejiang Province.

<h3>Dujiangyan - Grand Ceremony of Water Release</h3>
<p>— Reporter Zhou Xueduan stationed in Chengdu</p>
<p>Chengdu, 11th (Airmail)</p>
<p>Dujiangyan is located in Guan County, Sichuan, more than a hundred miles west of Chengdu. The project began during the reign of King Zhao of Qin in the Warring States period. The creator was Li Bing, the governor of Shu, more than 2,000 years ago. On the morning of the 5th, the reporter took a special car from the Water Conservancy Bureau from Chengdu. The morning sun was just rising, and the air was refreshing. The Chengdu-Guan County road is the essence of the Sichuan West Plain, a vast expanse of fields, much like Jiangnan, with green trees on both sides of the road, forming shade everywhere. Passing through Pi County, where "three cups of wine from Pi Barrel are enough, no need to buy more," we arrived at Guan County at 10 AM. Guan County is a major city in western Sichuan, and the main trading center for medicinal materials and tea in Sichuan and Tibet. The city is built against the mountain, with a majestic and dangerous terrain. Looking into the distance, the cloud peaks reach the sky, with green everywhere. To the left is Lingyan, and to the right is Mount Qingcheng, the famous Taoist site. Guan County is historically famous as the hometown of Yang Guifei, and there are still the Phoenix Nest and Huanfeng Tower, relics of Yang Guifei.</p>
<p>The Dujiangyan water release is an annual ceremony in Sichuan. Examining the Dujiangyan project, when Li Bing was the governor of Shu during the reign of King Zhao of Qin, there were floods at that time. Bing and his son surveyed the water situation and opened up the Lidui in the Guan County area at the foot of the mountains, diverting the water into the inner and outer rivers, and setting up the Dujiangyan to control the water power, diverting water to irrigate the Chengdu Plain, turning water disasters into water conservancy.</p>
<p>Observing the Sacrifice</p>
<p>The car arrived at Lidui Park in the city, and first went to Fulong Temple to observe the ceremony of sacrificing to Governor Li. The temple is on Lidui, below is the Baopingkou. According to legend, Li Bing subdued dragons here while managing the water, also known as Yongzhu Temple, built against the mountain, majestic and magnificent. The front hall enshrines Governor Li, and the back hall is Guanlan Pavilion. Climbing the pavilion, you can overlook the Baoping and Bibizi Kou. Overlooking the river from the railing, the torrents roll, the waves surge, and the entire Dujiangyan is in full view. The rapids below are surging, like ten thousand horses galloping, the situation is extremely magnificent. The sacrifice was presided over by Deng Xihou, the chairman of Sichuan Province, with the heads of various departments accompanying the sacrifice, using three livestock, burning candles and incense, firing iron cannons, reading sacrificial texts, and performing the most respectful salute. The ceremony was solemn and grand.</p>
<p>After sacrificing to Governor Li, they exited the temple through the Renzi Dam and went a mile or so to the Erwang Temple. The temple is built next to Yulei Mountain, where Du Shaoling's "Jade stacks floating clouds, changing ancient and modern" is located, towering halfway up the mountain, with flying pavilions and dangerous buildings, remotely facing Fulong Temple with its double eaves and complex buildings. It was built during the Jianwu period of the Northern Qi Dynasty, commonly known as the Xianyingwang Temple. Climbing the steps to the temple, at the entrance you can see the six-character formula for water management by the Li family: "Deep pools, low dams," and the eight-character motto: "Meet a bend, cut the corner, meet a straight, draw the heart": This is the guiding principle of water management for two thousand years, and also the most scientific method of water management. Further up is the main hall, with statues of the two kings, wearing brocade robes, which the temple keeper said were bestowed by Qianlong. Behind the temple is a memorial to Ding Wencheng (Baozhen), who made meritorious contributions to water management during the Qing Dynasty. The ceremony was still presided over by Acting Chairman Deng, and the ceremony was the same as that of the Old King.</p>
<p>Clouds Disappear and Mist Dissipates - Open the Water</p>
<p>After the sacrifice to Governor Li and the two Erlangs, the weir was officially opened. The Dujiangyan project stretches up and down for about four miles, divided into (1) the Baizhang Dam and the water diversion dam: located in the uppermost reaches, the purpose is to protect the bank and force the flood to flow into the right path. (2) Dujiang Fish Mouth, that is, the Dujiang main weir, under the Anlan Suspension Bridge, set up the fish mouth to divide the inner and outer rivers. The outer river is the main stream of the Min River, and the inner river draws water from the outer river to form three major tributaries that flow west into the Chengdu Plain. (3) Maca: On the fish mouth, is the gate for diverting the outer river waterway, which is the main object for regulating the water volume. The Maca is a wooden tripod frame, consisting of a number of tripods arranged in rows, filled with pebbles and covered with mud and sand, as a water diversion gate and dam. (4) Leveling Water Tank: Under the fish mouth, it is used to discharge excess water from the inner river. (5) Flying Sand Dam: The inner river water is introduced into the waterway and flows to Yulei Pass. The water flow turns, and this dam is set up to force the water into the Baopingkou. If the water volume in the inner river is too high, it will flow back into the outer river from here. (6) Baopingkou: Is the final section of the project, carved out of the mountain. Water rules are engraved on the rock to record the water volume in the inner river, from four strokes to twenty-two strokes. If the water surface exceeds eleven strokes, the water use in the Sichuan West Plain is sufficient, if it is lower, it is insufficient, and if it is higher, there is a surplus. The Fulong Temple is on the rock.</p>
<p>The central project of Dujiangyan is the fish mouth and Maca. The fish mouth divides the Min River into two. Usually, the water flow in the outer river is vast, and the riverbed is also high, so Maca is set up to isolate the two rivers. When the inner river does not need water, Maca is set up to block the water in the outer river. When the inner river needs water, some Maca are removed, and the water from the outer river flows into the inner river. Opening the water means that the Chengdu Plain needs spring water, and the Maca are officially removed to allow the water from the outer river to flow into the inner river. The total number of Maca is about fifty holes in the outer river (one tripod frame is one hole) and about seventy holes in the inner river. The amount of water needed in the inner river is determined by the number of Maca that are removed.</p>
<p>The water opening ceremony, after the chief officiant burns incense and respects the gods, and fires iron cannons, dozens of laborers successively pull down the Maca (24 holes were removed this year). The flood from the outer river rushes down. In an instant, the shallow inner river, which was only knee-deep, becomes a vast torrent with surging waves. The water opening ceremony is completely completed.</p>
<p>Chengdu-Guan County Road is Lively</p>
<p>The water opening ceremony is the most solemn ceremony in Sichuan once a year. In this theatrical ceremony, there is the highest respect of tens of millions of people. Each grand ceremony must be presided over by the highest administrative person in charge of Sichuan. This year, under the circumstances that the provincial government did not expand the event, the minimum estimate of the number of people coming to watch the ceremony was over 150,000. The irrigated area reaches about 6 million mu. The prosperity of western Sichuan is really dependent on it.</p>
<p>After the ceremony was completed, and after touring the entire Dujiangyan, the original car returned in the twilight. Along the way, on the Chengdu-Guan County road, more than a hundred special cars for viewing the ceremony, carrying more than 100,000 viewers full of admiration, were driving back and forth, which symbolized the unparalleled greatness of Li Bing and his son and the Dujiangyan water conservancy project they created.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Flying Catkins</h3>
<p>— Reckless</p>
<p>Spring seems to have arrived not long ago, yet it has quietly departed!</p>
<p>Ill and confined to my small room, I'm unaware of spring's tidings. The weather feels warm, and I feel languid; spring must be in full swing. Outside the window, I hear confused and startled bird calls, and delicate green branches hang in the corner. Not a single sign of spring has been missed. But suddenly, something flies in from the window, floating up and down, so light, so soft. It resembles feathers or cotton fluff, and for a moment, I truly can't recall what it is.</p>
<p>Moreover, it's elusive and intangible. What is this? These frivolous and tiny little things have broken into my lonely room?</p>
<p>Oh, it's willow catkins, telling me that "spring" has already left. They hold endless secrets, fearing I don't know that "spring" is gone, so they entwine around me, gently, softly, delivering this melancholy message. I'm both apprehensive and touched because they report this unwelcome news in such a tender way.</p>
<p>Opening the window, I take a closer look at the garden. "Spring" has indeed departed! Look, haven't many trees already "grown green leaves, providing shade, and their branches are full of fruit"? I blame myself for not going out for several days, making me so out of touch. Looking again at the sky, those things resembling feathers and cotton fluff are pervading everywhere, dancing up and down. They demarcate the seasons but also bring melancholy.</p>
<p>I saw willow branches sprouting "greenery" not long ago. I saw willow branches swaying with the feelings of spring not long ago. Suddenly, they send out the signal that spring is leaving. How astonishing is spring's brevity in the human world! I truly want to, like a poetry-obsessed poet, shout that I want to rush to the ends of the earth, catch up with spring, and reside with spring for a while.</p>

<p>Ever since the Greek philosopher Socrates showed us that art must pursue the three major principles of "Truth," "Goodness," and "Beauty," these have remained the targets for artists for thousands of years. Although seal carving is unique to our country and excels in its own way, it should also be measured against these international standards.</p>
<p>The influence of philology on seal art is immense. Therefore, if seal carvers wish to abandon the foundation of philology, they will be unable to expand the boundaries of their seal carving. After the publication of oracle bone inscriptions by Liu E and Luo Zhenyu, philology itself entered a new era. Scholars such as Rong Geng, Shang Chengzuo, Guo Moruo, and Dong Zuobin have begun using oracle bone script for seals, correcting the errors in Xu Shu's "Shuowen Jiezi" (Explanation of Characters), such as "爲" (wei) and "鬥" (dou). This is a significant step forward compared to relying solely on bronze inscriptions. (I have a separate book, "Xu Shu Chong's Shuowen Jiezi Explanation and Interpretation," that corrects these errors in detail.)</p>
<p>In his early years, Bai Shishi (Qi Baishi) became famous for his seals. However, he often created seals based on his own ideas without relying on philology. In his later years, he made great efforts to collect and destroy his earlier works. This single example shows that seal carvers should not rely solely on their talent and act independently. A seal belonging to Mr. Bai Chongxi, carved by Bai Shishi himself, features the character "白" (bai) written as "　." This is because the character "白" has too few strokes, so he added embellishments, thus losing its philological basis and becoming untrue.</p>
<p>I am not criticizing the late master Qi Baishi but rather using this as an example to warn future practitioners.</p>
<p>Most seal carvers rely on the book "Liushu Tong" (Comprehensive Six Scripts), like ignorant villagers relying on the "Tongshu" (Almanac). This is like asking a blind person for directions, which is extremely dangerous. The "Liushu Tong" contains numerous seals with many errors and easily confuses bronze inscriptions with Li Si's seal script, leading to serious mistakes.</p>
<p>Seal carvers should have "Duan Yucai's Annotations to Xu Shen's Shuowen Jiezi," "Wu Dacheng's Shuowen Gu Zhou Bu" (Supplement to Ancient Zhou Script in Shuowen), "Fo Yan's Shuowen Gu Zhou Bu Bu" (Further Supplement to Ancient Zhou Script in Shuowen), "Han Yin Fen Du" (Reading of Han Seals), "Gu Zhou Hui Bian" (Compilation of Ancient Zhou Script), "Leng Gu Zhai Ruan Shi Zhong Ding Yi Qi Kuan Zhi" (Inscriptions on Bronze Vessels and Tripods in the Ruan Collection of Leng Gu Zhai), "Feng Yunpeng's Jin Shi Suo" (Gleanings of Bronze and Stone Inscriptions) and other books for reference. They should also study oracle bone inscriptions from Liu E's "Tie Yun Cang Gui" (Iron Cloud's Collection of Oracle Bones) and Luo Zhenyu's "Yinxu Shuqi Jinghua" (Essence of Oracle Bone Inscriptions from the Ruins of Yin). Only after having a comprehensive understanding of various scripts should they begin carving, to avoid major flaws.</p>
<p>In the art of seal carving, scholars like Wen Sanqiao did not emphasize "beauty" and "truth" as much as we do today. Therefore, they merely imitated the Qin and Han styles. What is there to say about them? I am not a guardian of tradition, so I am not afraid of public criticism and am making this statement publicly.</p>
<p>Only by transcending "preserving truth" can we discuss "aesthetics."</p>
<p>Han seals are square and upright, without regard for the beauty of the seal face, so they are monotonous and follow old patterns without any change. Imitating them would be foolishly carving a mark on a moving boat. The beauty of Han seals lies in their "simplicity and solidity," and nothing more can be said about it. However, during the late Qing Dynasty, Zhao Zhiqian became known for his graceful style, opening up a new era. Those who followed were powerless and became obsequious, which is undesirable.</p>
<p>Zhiqian wanted to continue the style of Wan Baishanren, where "the river flows with sound, a thousand feet along the bank, a unique style in seal carving, and establishing a foundation with clear origins, deserving to be called a master." This seal of Wan Baishanren is similar to Zhao Mengfu's "Songxue Zhai" seal in its origin, feeling detached from vulgarity and emphasizing the structure more than Ding Jing and He Zhen. This seal has a grand and imposing air, like a heavenly horse soaring through the sky, impossible to trace its origins. Blindly imitating it would be foolish, and by Zhiqian's time, later imitators had already reached their limits.</p>
<p>The one who rivaled Zhiqian was Wu Changshuo, known for his "aged" style, using bold strokes, and a craftsman's delicate heart. He was able to handle characters effortlessly and play with them at will, all due to his mastery of calligraphy and painting, which he incorporated into his seal carving, dividing lines and arranging spaces to beautify the whole. His seals such as "Lao Can," "Jun," and "Junqing" are seamless and admirable. In particular, the "Po He Ting" seal opened up a bold new path in seal carving with its three elements of coarseness, strength, and clumsiness. The edges of his seals draw inspiration from broken steles, capturing their spirit and form. Bai Longshanren and Qi Baishi are his followers.</p>
<p>As for Qi Baishi, he still retained the bold style of naivety and simplicity, but it felt somewhat unrestrained and lacked Wu Changshuo's restraint. Qi Baishi's unrestrainedness easily fell into crudeness, and his forceful style easily lost its spirit. Under his influence, the spirit dissipated.</p>
<p>In recent times, Yang Zhongzi and Shou Shigong have made efforts to correct past errors. I once saw a seal by Yang Zhongzi that read "Jiangnan Yang Zhongzi." Although I felt his skill was slightly inferior, it was still full of substance and elegance. Shou Shigong's "Mu Jushi" seal was able to preserve the style of Han seals while showing his own unique style, worthy of being called a master.</p>
<p>When I was young and uneducated, I often saw popular side inscriptions and liked to write small characters, trying to imitate them. My teachers and friends strongly criticized me for this because small characters written with a needle are not suitable for viewing the power of knife and axe. I later discarded it like worn-out shoes. Over the past ten years of wandering, there are still those who value this skill in the market, so I briefly mention it to warn future students.</p>
<p>Side inscriptions must show the knife work to be considered superior. Hiding sharpness and pretending clumsiness are minor paths, so be cautious!</p>
<h3>From Wu Changshuo to Wang Geyi</h3>
<p>— Zheng Wuchang</p>
<p>During the late Qing Dynasty and early Republican era, the one who established himself as a major artist in flower painting was Mr. Wu Changshuo of Anji. Wu Changshuo loved to compose poetry, was skilled in seal carving, and excelled in writing stone drum inscriptions, all of which were majestic, ancient, and powerful, unmatched in his time. He said that he only started painting at the age of fifty. His painting was like his poetry, calligraphy, and seal carving. His painting was not just painting; it was using the artistic conception, brushwork, and spirit he gained from poetry, calligraphy, and seal carving, infused with a majestic spirit. Therefore, he was able to achieve such majestic and ancient power. Looking at Wu Changshuo's paintings and appreciating his poetry, examining his calligraphy, and studying his seal carving, the principles are the same, and the spirit is consistent. Studying Wu Changshuo's poetry, calligraphy, and seal carving may allow one to master his strengths. But if one wants to learn his painting, one must also excel in poetry, calligraphy, and seal carving. Scholars who do not understand this, seeing his bold brushstrokes and heavy colors, and thinking it is easy and unrestrained, blindly imitate him. Thus, they have the form but the face is completely different, or they resemble the face but the spirit is completely lost, painting a tiger but resembling a dog. The Wu style painting has thus been criticized by the public. My old friend Mr. Wang Geyi studied under Wu Changshuo the longest and with the greatest respect. He served him diligently, and he received the true transmission of Wu Changshuo's poetry, calligraphy, and seal carving. Therefore, his paintings, in terms of composition, brushstrokes, conception, and momentum, all follow Wu Changshuo's methods. Once, Wang Geyi visited Wu Changshuo, who was silently leaning on his pillow as if deep in thought. He then got up and stared at the plain paper spread out on the table. After a while, he sat back on the couch and nodded repeatedly. He then got up with a flourish, splattering ink and wielding the brush, as swift as the wind, like dragons and snakes moving, and in an instant, he completed a six-foot screen of wisteria flowers. He laughed and said, "I write with qi, not with a brush." Writing with qi is the secret to Wu Changshuo's painting. Whenever Wang Geyi created something, even a single flower or leaf, he would focus his spirit, concentrate his energy, and cultivate his qi beforehand. Then he would take off his clothes and grind the ink vigorously, moving as swiftly as a rabbit or a falcon, without hesitation or doubt. He splattered ink but cherished it like gold, wielding the brush with strength reaching the tip of the brush. It can be said that he had fully grasped Wu Changshuo's ability to write with qi. During his lifetime, Wu Changshuo gave Wang Geyi his inkstone and techniques, regarding him as the one who would carry on his legacy. Wang Geyi was also able to inherit his teacher's teachings and strive to improve. Over the past ten years, his achievements have become increasingly refined. Now he is presenting two hundred of his carefully composed works for public viewing. I know that readers who read Wang Geyi's paintings will be happy to know that the learning of Anji is now in Haimen.</p>
<h3>Appreciating Mengchan's Calligraphy and Seal Carving</h3>
<p>— Sui Weng</p>
<p>At the gathering of talented individuals, my eyes were immediately drawn to a pair of five-character couplets in official script. The couplet read: "Rituals and music are valued in the imperial court; writing preserves great elegance." It closely resembled Yi Chashou's imitation of Zhang Qian's stele, with a magnificent force that was astonishing. Another couplet was written in small seal script, reading: "Famous paintings should be read like poetic lines; ancient zithers should also be listened to as the sound of water," possessing a sense of fullness and grace.</p>
<p>Mengchan's achievements in seal and official script were already so impressive, but he considered his best to be his cursive script. In his cursive script couplets, I saw the three characters "Bao Mei Yi," and in his seals, I saw the two characters "Mei Pi," suggesting that he had many of Shen Mei Sou's (Shen Zengzhi) works in his collection. Therefore, his cursive script style was lofty and had a divine resemblance to "Hai Ri Chen." I wonder if he also knows Wang Yuanzhong, a professor and student of Shen Mei Sou? According to Wang, Shen Mei Sou's calligraphy could penetrate five layers of Xuan paper, showing the depth of his skill.</p>
<p>The couplets that collected Song Dynasty poems, Jiao's "Yilin" (Forest of Changes), and quotes from others were all appropriate and full of humor. The Song Dynasty poem collections were especially seamless, a feat that Yi Weng also excelled at. I loved his couplet, "Rowing a boat at Red Cliff, on the fifteenth of the seventh month; repairing at the Orchid Pavilion, at the beginning of the late spring," and "If Yelang has talent, it doesn't hurt to be arrogant; if the Xiongnu have not been subdued, how can we have a home?" These two couplets had the feeling of effortlessly creating profound insights.</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about his seals. His imitation of Zhao Zhiqian's "For five pecks of rice, I bend my waist" seal was so close it was almost indistinguishable. His "Sea Bend General Seal" could be included in the "Collection of Han Bronze Seals." The introductory seals, such as "Bu Cuo Tuo" (Make Up for Lost Time) and "Tian Xing Jian" (As Heaven Maintains Vigor), were not only well-carved but also had deep meaning. The most wonderful seal was "The Number One Madman of Jiangnan," which, together with Bai Jiao's "The Number One Lazy Man Under Heaven," could be called a pair of masterpieces. In reality, Fu Weng (Mengchan) was not lazy at all, and Chi Weng (Bai Jiao) was not mad either.</p>
<h3>Joy</h3>
<p>— Sha Lei</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest joy is the absence of joy.</p>
<p>Often, I rush towards joy with such fervor, as if giving my whole life or career.</p>
<p>But when I truly face joy, what vast loneliness I feel!</p>
<p>In the constant drawing and drinking of joy, I often feel even more thirsty.</p>
<p>I am gradually becoming intolerant of those cheers, laughter, and orations. I feel that they all belong to the realm of noise.</p>
<p>You see me going to a feast or a date with such difficulty, and I also feel a great weariness towards clothes that are too tidy.</p>
<p>You want me to go with you to travel, to see a play, to take a walk, and I will definitely agree; but can you see that all my expressions are still as they were when we sat facing each other in the small room? What I always see is the light drape of your dark hair, the silent, subtle floating.</p>
<p>The heavenly banquet must also be like our silent sitting facing each other. The things filled and emitted from some dishes and musical instruments must be invisible and inaudible things.</p>
<p>Why do I like you so much, my friend? Because the names of other women are all called "Joy," but you are "Loneliness."</p>
<h3>Wang Geyi's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Pan Boying</p>
<p>The affairs of art rise and fall with the world, reflecting the affairs of politics and the strength of the people. If we speak only of the affairs of art, then although the changes in its trends have an inevitable momentum, the subtle operations of gentlemen should not be ignored. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, the style of painting in our country has gradually taken a path of boldness and unrestraint. Crude and sparse imitators have taken the opportunity to disrupt the flow. In extreme cases, even those of craftsman's rank, taking the brush as their body, have stolen high names and clamored for attention. Therefore, the trend will inevitably change to become more careful and solemn, which is the trend of the times. Today, while the realm of carefulness and solemnity is not easily reached, the drawbacks of mediocrity have already arisen. Taking Shanghai as an example, the late styles of the Four Wangs and Wu and Yun are very prevalent. The highest of these only reach to Wen Zhengming, Shen Zhou, Qiu Ying, and Tang Yin. The Four Wangs, Wu and Yun, Wen, Shen, Qiu, and Tang are not bad. But to die under these families is not only a crime against the legalists but also shows that they do not know how to learn well. Although the forms of painting have differences in landscapes, figures, birds and animals, and flowers and plants, the principles for discussing the height of their spirit and charm through brush and ink are the same. Therefore, to break the drawbacks of today's mediocrity, although there are many ways, sweeping away its narrowness with a lively vitality must be one of them. Jin once said that Mr. Wu Changshuo was a noble and erudite scholar who was skilled in poetry and calligraphy. He used his spare time to paint and carve stones. His majestic talent and ancient charm illuminated the world and lived in Shanghai for a long time, but few were able to obtain his transmission of art. This is because those who learn from him have inferior character and cannot learn well, and it is useless to blindly imitate his traces. Therefore, those who follow the herd, relying on their ears as eyes, follow after craftsmen, and their loss is the same as that of mediocrity. Last year, I met Mr. Wang Geyi at the public memorial service at Huifeng Hall. Mr. Wang is a senior disciple of Mr. Wu Changshuo and Mr. Huifeng. I have occasionally visited his noble studio to read his poems and paintings, and I have also seen his collection of Mr. Wu's paintings and calligraphy. After that, I recognized that the method of Mr. Wu was truly present. Su Shi's poem says, "Only after beginning can you know that true freedom comes from refinement; it is not like the mad flowers that delight guests with cleverness." This is what the teacher and disciple of Po He Ting shared and laughed at! Mr. Wang Geyi is now going to present his calligraphy and painting, such as thousands of scrolls, to the connoisseurs of Shanghai. I believe that in order to correct today's mediocrity, break the confusion of superficiality, use the freedom of refinement to seek the true wandering outside of things, Wang Geyi has made a great contribution here. I hope those who know can discuss it together!</p>
<h3>Eulogy for Tan Liming</h3>
<p>— Zhang Shizhao</p>
<p>His heroic spirit suppressed his peers throughout his life, even in illness he still forcefully spoke, stubbornly holding up his head; unwilling to show weakness, his heart was even more detailed, unintentionally aggressive, his reason was truly pursued. He sought friends outside of cliques, especially ashamed to scheme with money; after thirty years of wandering, he retired from the rivers and lakes, his liver and gallbladder shone like the sun and moon.</p>
<p>He treated me as a good friend in times of urgent difficulty, and I was relieved to hear the praises of Jin; shining on people without concealing the moon in his chest, frequently opening his mouth to speak. A gentleman has writing that signifies a leopard's transformation, an official has no place to act like a salamander; a confidant wants to be like Ding Yi, and from now on, I will sprinkle tears on my worn broom.</p>
<p>(Self-note: The two gentlemen told me in their illness that they would sort out my manuscripts for me)</p>
<p>Li Batang said that Liming's sixtieth birthday was celebrated by his colleagues in the Xiemachang courtyard, and they asked me to write an article for his birthday. I had almost forgotten about this, and I am extremely ashamed, so I composed these verses:</p>
<p>The promised word still exists in Xiemachang, watching my friend depart with dignity? Our friendship was originally accustomed to silence, and the writing was all due to old age and illness. Today, I am left with a cry at the gate of the room, and I will keep the Eight Years in the purse, carrying it with me. It is pitiful that his skin and bones are completely broken, but after all, ascending the mountain is better than being in bed.</p>
<p>(Self-note for the phrase "in the purse" refers to avoiding air raids)</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood 406</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Altogether five people, representing four different groups. Among the five people, only the Korean representative and Zheng Yan had this slight difference in nationality; however, only Zheng Yan had a tenth or twelfth of discomfort in language. This refers to the Chinese national language; the language he usually used was mostly Japanese and Shanghainese.</p>
<p>"First of all, I should probably give a brief report on the situation." Tsurumi, speaking in pure Peking dialect, opened the discussion at this temporary round table meeting. He immediately and without reservation explained his and Pingzi's purpose in coming to Shanghai, "However, I didn't expect that Miss Nakamura, this main character, had not even started working and was already ambushed by someone... Originally, the time was so urgent, only a little more than a day in total, and we didn't know what we should do or how to do it. First, we encountered this setback, which no one expected... Originally, we planned to open Miss Nakamura's document at four o'clock. Now that we have everyone's righteous help, we will take a step back and wait a few hours before talking about it. Now, let's concentrate all our efforts on finding Miss Nakamura... What do you brothers think...?"</p>
<p>"I think there are two ways to handle this matter: a normal way and a discretionary way," said Special Agent No. 2 Li Ming. His reasoning was that "the secret of Eight" was related to the overall situation, and since time was so urgent, it would be better to proceed on both sides, since there was enough manpower. He advocated handling it in a discretionary way, opening Pingzi's letter.</p>
<p>"Looking at the contents of that secret document is also good... Maybe we need more preparation, and while Miss Nakamura's whereabouts have not been found, we can prepare on the one hand - this is if Miss Nakamura must command. If we can all proceed according to the guidance of that secret document, the time may be much more relaxed." This was Shouyi's opinion.</p>
<p>"Anyway, we have to look at it," Tsurumi hesitated slightly, then said to Zheng Yan, "Lao Yan, I have to trouble you again..." He was preparing to call Zheng Yan to go to the Banzai Hall to retrieve the document.</p>
<p>"But the document that the captain hid?... Zheng Yan still spoke in Japanese, "Because he was afraid of another mistake, when the subordinate went there just now, he took it with him, hidden on his body..." As he spoke, he took out the official document sent by the embassy to Pingzi from his shirt, the outer envelope already stained with some sweat.</p>
<p>"Haha..." Tsurumi took the envelope and was preparing to praise Zheng Yan for his "progress in learning," but because there were guests present after all, he retracted his words.</p>
<p>The envelope was opened, and inside was indeed another small envelope, with the words "To Miss Nakamura Pingzi, c/o His Excellency Okamoto, Japanese Ambassador to Shanghai" written on it. There was also a short note from Okamoto to Pingzi;</p>
<p>"One item from the Xiyuan Temple residence, entrusted to this館 for proper transfer. Because Your Excellency has not visited again, and fearing delay, we especially deliver it with care..."</p>

<h3>The Story of "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"</h3>
<p>— Yang Shi</p>
<p>Professor Dodgson of Oxford University stuttered badly and always had trouble speaking to people, but he loved to play with little girls. One afternoon, he led three girls on a boat ride on the Thames River, and the children insisted he tell them a story. Our professor then began to describe an absurd story off the top of his head. It was about a girl who fell asleep in a rabbit hole and woke up to find herself in a strange fairy realm, and she encountered many magical things. They were amazed and asked him to write it down. Professor Dodgson jokingly agreed and spent the night completing it, and named it "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland." Alice was the name of one of the three little girls.</p>
<p>After finishing writing, he put the manuscript aside and soon forgot about it. Not long after, a friend saw it and asked him to publish it. The professor said angrily, "Do you think a professor from Oxford would publish something like this?" He refused.</p>
<p>The friend was also curious and published it despite his objections. Unexpectedly, the day it was published, it caused a sensation among the children of London, and it was sold out on the same day. Professor Dodgson could not find a reason why this book was so enthusiastically welcomed by children.</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— Xu Jin</p>
<p>"National Seedlings" and "The Country's Future Masters" - these two titles for children are unanimously supported by fellow countrymen above the age of adulthood.</p>
<p>Raising children's status, increasing children's welfare... these are all routine slogans for Children's Day.</p>
<p>It is not easy for artists to vividly and accurately depict the lively, natural, innocent, and adorable children.</p>
<p>The Gu Family Instructions say, "Teach the wife when she first arrives, teach the child when it is an infant," which proves the importance of childhood education.</p>
<p>On this day of enthusiastically celebrating Children's Day, who can be inspired to show some of the "Love my child, and extend that love to other's children" goodness to the wandering children on the streets?</p>
<p>Children are like a blank sheet of paper, and teachers need to use black ink to write on it the many beautiful historical traces of "Later generations are to be feared, how do we know that those who come after will not surpass us?"</p>

<h3>The Disaster of the Atomic Bomb</h3>
<p>— Dongfang Hui</p>
<p>What are the consequences of the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki? To what extent have the disasters caused reached? These are all concerns of medical authorities from various countries.</p>
<p>Dr. Bellus of the University of Chicago led a group of medical personnel (including famous Japanese doctors) to conduct a thorough examination of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Their conclusion was that although eighteen months had passed since the 1945 atomic bombs, their biological effects still existed in the bombed areas, or even continued for several years. They examined and studied many patients who were injured and burned by the atomic bombs at the time, and they found several important consequences of the atomic bombs.</p>
<p>The most mysterious consequence was the formation of special scabs on the skin of those who were burned by the atomic bomb fire. Those who had been exposed to fire or ultraviolet radiation at the time would continue to develop these scabs or scars many months later. The color ranged from pink to brownish-red, distributed throughout the body and face, swollen like elephant skin, and the appearance was terrifying. The skin with scabs was particularly sensitive, causing unbearable pain. The scope of these scabs was not limited to the exposed parts of the injury; they would gradually spread everywhere. Doctors believed that this tissue destruction might be a precursor to tumors, and there was no certainty whether it could be treated with medicine.</p>
<p>Another significant disaster of the atomic bomb was the damage to people's reproductive abilities. Several months after the bombing of Hiroshima, Japanese doctors examined 124 survivors and found that one-third of them had lost their ability to reproduce. The explosion of an atomic bomb could cause the creatures within a three-mile radius of the impact point to lose their reproductive function. Two-thirds of the women in the ultraviolet radiation range of the atomic bomb suffered menstrual disorders, and atomic energy also caused pregnant women to miscarry.</p>
<p>In terms of heredity, it is not yet certain whether the atomic bomb will cause a negative consequence, because this needs to wait until the next generation is born. Some biologists used the fruit flies that breed the fastest in Hiroshima to experiment, but there were no satisfactory conclusions. Some of the children born after the bombing died immediately or were stillborn, and there were no reports of later births. However, doctors firmly believed that some mothers would kill and bury the hideous babies they gave birth to.</p>
<p>This is indeed a terrible disaster. The atomic bomb not only brought disaster to present-day humans, reducing their reproductive functions, but also made the next generation of humans tend to be ugly and in danger of extinction. Who can say that the disaster of "The Last Days of the Ancient City" will not happen again in the world?</p>
<h3>English Scholar Ku Hung-ming</h3>
<p>— Han Guang</p>
<p>Reading "Anecdotes of Ku Hung-ming" in the "Free Talk" section of the April 1st issue made me clap my hands and exclaim in admiration, and laugh incessantly; this old man can be considered a master of humor. Coincidentally, I have in hand an article titled "English Scholar Ku Hung-ming" by Mr. Xie Songgao (published in "Essays of Young China," pages 30-31), which also narrates the life of this old man. Therefore, I translate it and send it to "Free Talk."</p>
<p>"I have never met Ku Hung-ming. I have only heard some things about him and his extraordinary knowledge of English. His Latin was very good, and his reading of English literature was even more extensive.</p>
<p>He had a concubine. He read English literature, but his spirit was thoroughly Chinese. He could not get along with modern Chinese students.</p>
<p>From this, I learned a lesson. We can have a rich knowledge of the English language, and at the same time, we can develop a beautiful English writing style, but we still cannot grasp the spirit of the English people. The spirit of the English people is primarily Christian. They particularly value honesty, purity (no concubines), and a fair love for their friends.</p>
<p>From 1885 to 1905, he served under Zhang Zhidong. He had one wife and one concubine. I don't know if he had any more wives besides that. He was loyal to the Qing Dynasty and always wore a queue.</p>
<p>Mr. Ku was humorous, but sometimes his criticism of others was quite harsh. He was a scholar, but he lacked ideals and a modern spirit. Therefore, it can be said that he was a failure. We must serve the people; when our work fails, we are failures!</p>
<p>I admire Mr. Ku to a certain extent. I hope we can free ourselves from his many weaknesses. Let us use the power of education to benefit the common people. At the same time, let us love only one woman and uphold our noble ideals—loyalty and democracy."</p>
<h3>### Happy Child — Fortune Favors Him Through Singing</h3>
<p>— Rong Guan</p>
<p>Steel magnate Andrew Carnegie was sitting quietly in the corridor of his office when he heard a child singing. The singing, like a new oriole leaving the valley or a swallow returning to its nest, revealed the child's inner joy through its light and beautiful melody. Because it was a song he particularly loved, especially the child's voice, the child was called before him and often sang for him.</p>
<p>This child was just a stable boy, sweeping the horse gear and cleaning the stable every day while singing this melodious and pleasant song. He worked and sang every day. In this way, his singing reached the ears of the steel magnate not far away. He was promoted and appreciated by Carnegie and became the general manager of Bethlehem Steel Company. His name was Charles M. Schwab.</p>
<p>Drama Review</p>
<h3>### "Beautiful Women Walking"</h3>
<p>— Ma Gao</p>
<p>The author's two works, "Three Modern Women" and "Beautiful Women Walking," are based on two stages of the national struggle for liberation against Japan, marking typical figures and events of two eras, and their central question is one: "Women, in the struggle for freedom and liberation, women with dual tasks and dual pains." However, the latter has a deeper and newer interpretation and viewpoint.</p>
<p>Here, the author severely condemns Ruo Ying's weaknesses, urging her to abandon her love for material enjoyment and her despicable feelings of bowing her head in compromise. Placing her between Yu Liang and Wang Zhongyuan—between good and evil—to be tested, she ultimately failed the test and had to wag her tail, begging to enter a comfortable nest. This was inevitable in her path: "compromise." However, the author hopes she can break free from the chains around her neck and give her a "bright tail." This seems a bit forced. For a woman like Ruo Ying, it is probably not easy to stand up straight today, is it?</p>
<p>The encouraged and praised Xin Qun, this female warrior, is brave, capable, and willing to work. She is a model of the ideal new woman, but we still find her not full enough. It seems that we can find more weaknesses of female life in her; she should not be so perfect and great.</p>
<p>The insulted and damaged soul, the female worker Jin Mei, is the most moving and complete character in the author's writing, representing countless women who bear difficult tragic fates. She has blood, flesh, and tears, making people sympathize and sigh. Only when such a person embarks on a new path can people rejoice and bless her from the bottom of their hearts; because those who have endured suffering and become steel are unbreakable in battle.</p>
<p>Such a new type of multi-scene play, appearing on our stage for the first time, gives us a valuable harvest. The honor should go to the director, whose powerful hand integrates the entire play into a new style. The gentle and moving narration, the thrilling accusations, all demonstrate meticulous craftsmanship. The actors are a whole, cooperative and complete. Even the most unimportant roles are performed earnestly and diligently, which is worthy of praise. However, some people's pronunciation is not accurate enough, and the performance is not "pure," with some rough edges.</p>
<p>However, I sincerely recommend this as a fine work that is well worth seeing, with new and valuable gains in script, direction, and acting.</p>
<h3>Rambling Talks on Solitary Mooring</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>Everyone likes to envy people in positions different from their own. Common people envy officials, while those who dine at court like to adopt nicknames like "fisherman" or "woodcutter." Children envy their grandparents' power and freedom, while grandparents stroke their beards and sigh, "If I could go back sixty years and be as young as this child, that would be true happiness." Men envy women's unearned gains, while women envy men's ability to be active. This tendency shows that everyone is unwilling to think about people in positions different from their own, let alone rationally compare and understand each other's joys and sorrows. The unrest in the world may also be due to this general psychological state.</p>
<p>I think the moon is more fashionable than the sun, perhaps because it is more stingy in bestowing light upon us and because the moon is only full once.</p>
<p>A dry seed will grow and bloom in suitable soil.</p>
<p>A beautiful imagination can cause many changes in real life.</p>
<p>A ray of sunshine is enough to elicit ripples of "understanding."</p>
<p>I boasted to Shen Zhi that the new "understanding" was a huge sun.</p>
<p>Shen Zhi smiled lightly and said, "Because the sunlight is particularly dazzling, you especially like the sun. In fact, the sun is like a star; its hugeness is only due to its proximity. In infinite space, there are infinitely many existences larger than the sun."</p>
<p>Shen Zhi's words have their own logic. However, as far as our world is concerned, I still praise the sun.</p>
<h3>"Extension of Love"</h3>
<p>— Lü Yan</p>
<p>I often see the words "extension of love" in short notes. "Extension of love" was originally an expression of human virtue, but nowadays, it is often misused by the general public, even abused so generously, thoughtlessly, and distortedly.</p>
<p>A friend told me a true story: A certain gentleman, possessing real talent, had been unemployed for more than a year. He wrote countless applications and went to several employment agencies, using up several dozen photos, but was rejected everywhere. Finally, he shyly went to see an old classmate who had been promoted to a "chief" position. Unexpectedly, that classmate generously gave him a letter of introduction, introducing him to a director who owned a large organization. The wording in the letter was sincere, ending with: "Extending love and promoting." After seeing the director, he exchanged another letter of introduction, inevitably "extending love" again. After several twists and turns of "extending love," he received the final letter of introduction, from which he could stop making pointless runs—the name on the envelope was none other than his old classmate.</p>
<h3>About War Criminals</h3>
<p>— Zi Ji</p>
<p>The international section of this newspaper on the 22nd had a news item titled "Nazi Arch-Criminals, No Place to Bury Them." It said that the bodies of the ten major Nazi war criminals who were hanged last October, as well as Göring's body, were cremated and placed in military trash cans... Then the cans were placed in the back seat of an ordinary German black sedan and driven straight to the Isar River in Munich, where they were thrown into the rushing river. This was "Hitler's henchmen's greatest journey," and so on.</p>
<p>The trial of Nazi German war criminals has come to an end. The ashes of the demon king were thrown into the river, with no place to bury them, which is truly gratifying.</p>
<p>But looking back at the situation of the remnants of fascism in the Far East, who are stubbornly quibbling and delaying, it makes us sigh endlessly. It is truly, why are we so generous to this side and so stingy to the other?</p>
<p>The establishment of the Tokyo International Tribunal has been a long time, but the war criminals have not yet been sentenced. This not only makes the people of our victorious countries feel impatient, but this pretentious show of the trial has long been regarded as a joke by the Japanese people in the defeated country. Let's look at the Tokyo dispatch from the Central News Agency:</p>
<p>"... The International Tribunal has opened, but when it will end is unknown... It is estimated that this defense case will continue for two months, and the trial may be in mid-autumn... The court employs 400 people and consumes tens of thousands of tons of paper... The Japanese people have become impatient and claim that it is absurd to defend war criminals who cannot be defended. The best policy is to immediately put an end to it. In the eyes of the Japanese people, the trial of war criminals has become a farce."</p>
<p>Human feelings are like galloping horses, and world affairs are like a game of chess. This is a Chinese proverb. Perhaps Japan, although a defeated country, has reached an ideal state and is thriving under the support of the United States. And MacArthur is also charmed by the flattery of the Japanese government and public, so he gives "convenience" everywhere. It's not just war criminals. We have also heard the news that the United States is advocating opening up private trade with Japan and removing "peace industry" electric spinning machines from reparations materials, so as to preserve the Japanese textile industry.</p>

<h3>Art and Literary Circles</h3>
<p>This newspaper published a children's novel "Children's Day" by Fan Quan on April 4th. The article pointed out that on the good day of Children's Day, a large number of children were falling into the abyss of sorrow. The theme is serious, but the narration is extremely humorous and light. When Mr. Zhao Jingshen lectured at Tianen Elementary School, he read the article aloud in public, vividly and vividly, and the listeners all laughed until their stomachs hurt.</p>

<p>The long novel "A Great Wind and Snow" recently published by Wanye Bookstore, written by Sun Lu, depicts how a group of sincere and patriotic young people encountered the encirclement of a harsh environment in a declining society and failed to thrive. The writing is magnificent and the depiction is profound.</p>

Representatives from magazines such as Wen Cui, Middle School Students, World Knowledge, Literary Spring and Autumn, Modern Women, New Culture, Monthly, Times, Soviet Literature, Rebirth, Scientific Era, Review, Soviet Medicine, and Economic Weekly were present. Directors were elected and dinner was served.</p>

<h3>Record of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Xiao Rong, your sister likes you. How about letting you sit in a small chartered car and go to Chongqing with Aunt Jin to see your father first?" Turning back, she asked him softly.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay." Rong'er was still young after all. Hearing Lao Zhu say how comfortable the small chartered car was and that he could see his father in Chongqing first, he naturally agreed happily; and when he lived in Xu Shaoming's house, Jin Aili often took him to play, and his impression of her was not bad, so he didn't feel the need to go with his mother.</p>
<p>"That's good too!" Lao Zhu, seeing that this problem was solved, busily continued to pack the bedding that he hadn't finished packing earlier; but Lan was even busier. Fei Fei changed Rong'er, so the clothes had to be reorganized again.</p>
<p>"Mom! Do you want to change a piece of clothing for brother?" Fei Fei glanced at Xiao Rong and suggested to her mother excitedly.</p>
<p>"Okay. Let's put this one on him!" Lan smiled and picked out a set of thin voile children's clothes.</p>
<p>Fei Fei skillfully dragged Xiao Rong to a corner of the room, washed his face and hands, took off his dirty clothes, put on the new clothes, and used a small comb to comb his short hair, without any mess or panic; Lao Zhu repeatedly stretched his legs to look at them, and the shadow of Fei Fei's teenage years immediately appeared in his mind.</p>
<p>At nearly twelve o'clock, Zhu Zhaonian helped Lan pack everything up. A small bedding roll contained a blanket, a thin quilt, and most of Xiao Rong's clothes; in addition, two suitcases, one large and one small, contained what Lan considered to be all the more valuable things in their family. She had originally wanted to add another one, but she was worried that Jin Aili would make things difficult, so she temporarily changed her mind. Zhu Zhaonian strongly agreed with this point, because he really didn't want to bother Zhu Xilong, such a corrupt new bureaucrat, so as not to affect his freedom of speech in the future.</p>
<p>"Brother, why don't you leave Rabbit Daddy here and let me take it away, okay?" When Lao Zhu hired a rickshaw, loaded the luggage, and came back to prepare to take them out together, Fei Fei suddenly made this request to Xiao Rong as if she had thought of a very important matter.</p>
<p>Xiao Rong had already followed Lan close to the door when he heard his sister ask this, but it reminded her instead.</p>
<p>"No! No!" he said, jumping up and down, while turning to look at the bed, his two small eyes widened. "Where's Rabbit Daddy? I want to take him with me! Mom! I want to take him with me!"</p>
<p>He quickly pounced on the bed and picked up the bronze rabbit behind a stack of pillows. Lan didn't have time to grab him.</p>
<p>Fei Fei stared blankly in disappointment, her face full of dejection. (IV) (V)</p>
