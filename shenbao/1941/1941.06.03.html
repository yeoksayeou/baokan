<h3 id="c19">醫師公會舉辯防疫運動 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>上海市醫師公會最近又聯合熱心為社會服務之醫師醫院、舉行一個月防疫運動，以期實現理想的免疫：在公衆醫藥問題最嚴重而苦於無法解決時候，有此一舉，不無欣忭。</p>
<p>此舉意義之重大，不僅在醫師能犧牲其一小部分時間精神藥物為可貴；而在醫師發揚其服務道德精神不以一已之診務是重，而以公衆之健康為懷：達到醫藥最高之目的、須防病於未然，莫治病於已發為可佩。蓋一般心理，但知「病急亂投醫」，不知平時攝生之要，及藥物預防之功。今得醫師之提倡，不僅喚起公衆之注意，亦惟醫師對病家有所指示，乃能深入人心，信任無間，轉相傳述，不期而自至，不約而自來，咸出於自願、無所用其强迫、收效之宏、自非一般可比。夫養成預防疾疫之習慣，確乎為公衆之福。若以有防疫注射之故，縱情於聲色，饕餮於口腹，以為可無所却慮，是誠大謬：要知疾病之來、皆為平素體質衰弱、或飮食不節，起居無常，削弱原有之抵抗力，而予病魔以侵人之機會。故醫師於防疫注射之際，還當以攝生之道，保衛之方，深切告誡，否則轉以防疫之故，而助其傷身敗德，是豈防疾之本意哉！</p>
<p>又觀歷來之防疫注射、每未能擇人而施、既不問其身心之狀態，亦不問其有病無病、惟知出以强迫行動。及反應之來，纏綿床第、或竟以引起其他疾病者有之；以其生理上之不健全，或有疾病在身，竟以喪生者有之、至於化膿糜爛、其小焉者也。是豈得謂為醫理上之預防、策公衆之健康，直以兔鼠相視，牛馬相待，不啻為其作免疫之試騐，消弭恐怖疫癘之心理，求得精神上之自慰而已。今醫師公會之防疫運動，「必三次注射，然後始給證書；必先施診察，然接注射：遇有不能注射之人，則簽發禁忌證書；必嚴格消毒，注射後不致發生膿腫。」所謂「合理的防疫注射」，當之而無媿。惟是各醫師忙於日常診務，防疫注射，本可委之於護士之手；但既先診察然後注射，自必循名覈實，不以手續為麻煩，而怠於履行，抑且義務之舉，尤不應稍示輕忽，亦不可意存倨傲，務使來者知感，未來者起慕，則於待人接物之際，又宜出以和祥慈愛之態度可知。夫既名之日「運動」，自在多一人知曉，多一人免疫，為其唯一之目標，故應由多方面宣傳，俾人人有得悉之機會。而况各醫師注射時間，斷不能取得一致；免使熱心免疫者多所奔波，宜由醫師公會發給担任防疫注射之醫師，以紙牌一方，張貼於診所所在地之里衖或門外，標明醫師之姓名及注射時間，及起訖日期，並不妨附麗防疫宣傳之文字圖案，此可使不論其來診或過路之人，咸得聞見；再加以互相傳述之力量，遐邇廣播。推行自速。一面仍望醫師公會之會員踴躍參加，俾竟全功，此固不朽之舉也。若造福羣衆之事業，不斷施行，則公衆心埋對於西醫之信仰力，不期然而根深蒂固，間接收效，又豈淺尠哉！</p>
<p>惟自百物騰貴，醫師為自由職業階級，再加以藥品暴漲，醫藥費之增加為事實之所難免。但醫藥在生活上地位之重要，不亞於糧食燃料，且其出入之間，生死係之。然如目前之醫藥費，已為一般薪工階級所難堪，甚至接一平產五百元，割一蚓狀須千金，此雖係絕少數，夠可使人咋舌。至駐院治療，動輒數千金，在各醫院開支浩大，或許以為未足，富厚之病家，亦無足重輕，惟在大多數之病家往往一病所費，羅掘俱窮，破產有餘。且病固無擇於貧富，越以勞力多而營養薄，則其病之也易。醫師同為職業階級，個中甘苦，必共知之。則如何解決目前公衆醫藥問題之困難，此在今日之醫藥界，固亦責無旁貸者也。</p>

<h3 id="c40">歐戰業談（六）（十）　英國的遠東兵工廠　澳洲的資源人力 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>澳洲兵的勇敢善戰，在這次歐職中已口碑載道。他們會在北菲洲里比亞擊潰義大利車，在新加坡鞏固防務，並在遠東近東方面拱衛不列顚帝國。但這不足為奇，澳洲悄悄地成為一犬兵工廠，源源造成大批新式軍械，纔是驚天動地的事。事實上，澳洲的迅赴事機，整頓軍備，在民治各國淘裏，成績堪稱首屈一指。澳洲軍火產最現已超過印度，且有追及加拿大之勢。若以人口作比例，澳洲七百萬人創造如此成績，早使英美兩國為之慚愧了</p>
<p>澳洲新大陸在六年前不過廣漠一片，僅出產羊毛礦產和木材，工業品，都仰給英國。全境煤鐵金銀銅鉛鋅銻各種礦藏，係由布洛肯山礦業公司獨家開採。鐵礦是在南部鐵山中開採的，其他金屬是在布洛肯山內地開採的，煤礦是在海濱的新堡港開採的，那　現有巨大的熔爐和碾鐵機。自一九三八年以來，澳洲每年鋼鐵產量巳從一百二十萬噸提高至一百七十萬噸（美國去年鋼鐵產額亦不過六千七百萬噸）。目下有幾卞家兵工廠，正在趕造利恩斐式來福槍和刀，維甘斯式重機關槍，勃林式大砲和砲車，高射砲，海軍用無烟火藥，彈藥，砲彈，炸彈，巡邏戰車，深射炸彈，水雷，鋼盔和飛機降落傘。英國木部製造第1架勃林式大砲，歷時四年之久，澳洲得到圖樣後，不消一年功夫，就造成了。</p>
<p>至於飛　工業，澳洲還不能製造第一綫戰鬥機，但製造練習機，尤其是北美維拉威式練習機，巳所擅長。雪梨落附近現正籌設飛機廠一所，以便製造不列斯都蒲福式轟炸機。澳洲第一綫飛機備有美國洛克海特赫特遜式飛機一百餘架，其空軍訓練計劃，預定到一九四三年，全國可有空軍戰鬥員五萬七千名，包括駕駛員一萬四千名。</p>
<p>澳洲人旣當於毅力效能和民治精神，當然很可信賴，尤其是軍需部長劉易斯，他和美國國防委員會主席諾森一般，有大批製造的材能。此人原任布洛肯山礦業公司經理，後被政府選拔，亦猶之諾森原任通用汽車公司總栽，終於給羅斯福統所物巴一般。開戰以來澳洲所耗戰費巳近十萬萬美元，徵發遠征軍十二萬員名，國防軍廿五萬員，擔任戰時儲蓄共達五千萬美元，並在一年半時間之內，一躍由入工業國之林澳洲現已動員全部資源，供英國應用。主要產物中如糖一項，全世界白種人種植糖蔗，只有澳洲一處。西部森林豐茂，木材無窮，伐木者僅選取大樹，且不全樹斫伐。著名的卡利大樹高達二百八十英尺，厚廿四英尺。耶辣大樹數量更多，兩種木村質地都很堅重。全境有綿羊一萬萬四千萬頸，出產大批羊毛羊肉，羊毛細長堅靱，為縫製軍服必不可少。此外，牲畜，水菓，小麥及各種礦產，亦取之不竭。故澳洲山地的礦產和海岸一帶的物產，可以供英國無限的應用。雪梨港後面的山脈中並曾發現煤油，布洛肯山礦業公司一度以此作為要挾，迫使荷蘭殼牌油减低售價。</p>
<p>雪梨是不列顚帝國第三大都會，僅次於倫敦和加爾各答，人口一百三十萬。全城有工廠五千所，其北面的新堡港，南面的開勃拉港，都是著名的煉鋼區，其發達的情形與美國鋼鐵業中心譬　堡不相上下。該兩區所用的鐵砂，都用貨船從南部埃爾牛島的鐵山運來。</p>
<p>鐵山的礦砂由布洛肯山礦業公司開採，其數量之鉅實足驚人。地曆表面的貯藏量已達一萬萬噸之多，可以開採至耶穌紀元二千年不竭。地底還有幾許礦砂，尙浩瀚難測。新堡的煉鐵廠聯絡極為週密，碾鐵機可以容納敞燼的全部鐵塊，敞爐可以容納熔燼的全部鐵液，熔燼又可消化一定數量的礦砂，各熔爐又有足額的焦煤，供給燃料。</p>
<p>鐵塊煉成後，再進一步煉鋼。澳洲工業和美國同病相憐之處，就是缺乏用以製造機器的各種基本機械。目下所用的大部份係自　美瑞士乃至德國購得的據軍需部次長勃洛列白最近說，澳洲現有工廠三十所，趕造這種機械，並巳向國外定購一千萬美元。全國兵工廠三十六所，現有工人二萬名，刻正進行三大工作計劃，尙須招添大批工人。</p>
<p>澳洲的工業出品，比之英美德等國當然瞠乎其後，但現已積極調整，以供給遠東英國駐軍應用。布洛肯山煉鐵廠出的　管，墨爾鉢廠出的高射砲，共和飛機廠出的練習飛機，品質旣優，又能大批製造。</p>
<p>澳洲是淸一色的白種人世界，與其他白種人居住的大陸，迥　不同。澳洲人是一個自尊爽直和實事求是的民族，酷似美國台克撒州人。澳洲人常穿污舊的工衣，帶着氈帽，在樹林中亦然。雪梨人常穿垂尾的外衣，帶白領結，出入於下三等的銷夜窟裏，若無其事，還有不少澳洲人，口　裝着假齒。</p>
<p>澳洲人的消費量很大，他們和鄰邦紐西蘭人聯合起來，可以消費和全世界各地等量的麵粉，食機。牛油，牛排和羊肉。他們嗜茶若命，善作牛飮，茶色墨黑，用—夸脫的鐵鍋，在樹林中考究煎成。他們歡喜游泳，儘管海濱鯊魚出沒，一日間捕獲達五十尾，他們毫無所　（雪梨海濱現已查無鯊魚踪跡）。</p>
<p>澳洲女權相當發達，首都康勃拉僅存的石像兩座，女戰神毘綠娜即其一，頭頂骷體，胸袒　乳，充分流露女　的英勇精神。開戰以來，婦女們不時在街頭列隊游行，老少妍醜，一律參加，并有擔任救護工作的。雪梨游泳風氣最盛，出產健美女性，</p>
<p>雪梨城中，建有第一次歐戰紀念牌，上鐫英國大文豪吉百齡「永誌不忘」的題句。澳洲再度與英國並肩作戰，可說是秉上次大戰的精神。澳洲代理總理說得好，一太平洋大戰若果爆發，澳洲將抗戰到底，保衛獨立。無人敢說告人孤立無援，不配應付大難。」</p>

<p>落花生傳到中國的經過怎樣？是誰初次把它輸入的？我曾徧翻李時珍的木草綱目和徐元扈的農政全書，而我不到片紙隻字的計載，那麽，它的蒞臨中國，當然比番薯和玉蜀黍為時較晚了。要查考對於落花生眞正最早的記載，大慨莫過於方以智所作的物理小識。在這書的飮食鬥番豆條下說：「番豆，一名落花生，士露子。二三月種之，一畦不過數子。……藤上開花，花絲落土成實，冬後掘土取之。殼有紋，豆黃白色，炒熟甘香似松子味。……」按方以智桐城人，曾中崇禎進士，為明末四大公子之一，公元一六四四年明亡後，創髮為佾：那麽，我　落花生的傳入中國是在明淸之交的十七世紀，是有這萬難推翻的證據的。再根據福建省福淸縣志的記載：『落花生本出外國，康熙初年，有僧應元赴扶桑（日本，）覔　寄回…。」海辨駁它說：「日本稱落花生為南京豆，則日本落花生之種得自中國可知。福淸縣志之說，似不可信。」我以為就是這事可信的話，也只能比作林懷蘭輸入番薯的例子，把它看作殊途同歸；物理小識那種鐵案，還是不可動搖的。至於吳其濬植物名實圖考所引證檀萃滇海虞衡志的話：『落花生為南果中第一，其咨於民用者最廣。宋元間，與棉花，紅薯之類，粵估從海上諸國得共種，歸種之：呼棉花為吉貝，紅薯曰地瓜，落花生曰地豆，滇曰落花松。』我們一看，就知道它犯了時間上的錯誤，而是想當然的話：因為宋元間新大陸還沒有發現，更從那　來的紅薯和落花生？植物名實圖考又引證：『南城縣志：俗呼番豆，又曰及地果。贛州志：落花生一名「長生菓」……。還有「南越筆記：落花生……花吐成絲，而不能成莢，其莢別生根莖間。掘沙取之，殼長寸許，皺紋中有實三四，似蠶豆，味甘以淸，微有參氣，亦名落花參，……」這一切却是絕好的史料。—現在總而一句：落花生是閩粵人於十七世紀時由海外—菲律濱羣島？）輸入中國的，首先栽種於南方，以後普及到北部。</p>
<p>花生有　巴西種J和［秘魯種」的分別，前已說過。巴西種的顆粒大，秘魯種的顆粒小。首先傳到中國的，正是那顆粒小的秘魯種，就是現在普通人所稱為「小落花生一的。那顆粒大的巴西種，—普通人直稱之為落花生，同前一種對舉，纔加上一個「大字。—不過是近年來纔栘植到我國，也大有完全取前一種的位置而代之之勢。還記得幾年前有一位先輩老農告訴我說：「小落花生是中國原有的，—他當然不知道是先從海外　過來的—大落花生是從外國新來的。……褚乙然在所作油料作物栽培法書中也說：「……後美國收帥將美國大粒種傳入山東一帶，因品質優良，產量豐富之故，遂競相栽種。眞的，在十幾年以前，北方的落花生市上，還是秘魯種與巴西種的雜然並陳，勢均力敵；現在充斥在市塲上的，祇有那大落花生堆積如山罷了，小落花生即非絕跡，也是稀而又少的。然而按品質說，褚乙然的話是不對的，實在是小落花生還遠的超過那大落花生：小落花生不特風味格外雋美，而且出油量能達到百分之五十猶强，至於大落花生則不過出油百分之叫十。大落花生的所以佔得上風，祇是「產量豐富」而已。（未完）</p>

<p>— 簫雲</p>
<p>當汽車初次在美國的公路上出現的時候，拖車的馬，莫不大驚失色，有許多就此停在路中，不肯走動一步。後來看慣了這些「怪物』，也就安之若素，可是已被r怪物』所淘汰了。</p>
<p>最近美國加利福尼亞州蒙　維亞地方的養鷄塲主人，正在與地方當局大辦交涉，申請禁止飛機近該養鷄塲。因為有許多母鷄，看見道些r怪物J而不肯蹲下生蛋，整天祗是站着。</p>
<p>人類有時候也是如此的。我們保守的性格，使我們看不慣新的事物，使我們反對新的思想。然而時代的進展是並不留情的，它並不因我們的保守而停滯下來。反之，却將不顧一切地突飛猛進。我們唯一的辦法不是掩耳盜鈴或視若無睹，也不是抗議或反對，而是睜開我們的雙眼，認識新事物，新思想，新時代，而跟着它去進步。其他的動作都是徒然的。人應該是比馬與鷄聰明一點的。</p>
<p>軍備</p>
<h3 id="c101">空軍信鴿 <a href="#c101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— 增修</p>
<p>信个信由你，英國空軍的飛機，飛到德國或德軍佔領區轟炸的時候，不但裝有殺人的炸彈，而月帶着象徵和平的鴿子。那些鴿子正是軍用的信鴿，可以補新式的軍用品之不足，事實上曾救過許多人的性命。原來空軍將士出外作戰，祇靠着飛機上的無綫電機和木國的司令部互通消息，但是無綫電機一旦失了效用，—這種事情在敵軍的砲火夾攻之下，是極常見的，—豈不是要束手無策嗎？他們有時在海中飄泊，有時困居荒島，就非利用那些信鴿不可了。靈敏的信鴿會飛回英國，將不幸的將士的消息傳給司令部。保衛國土的軍事機關，有時因為空襲猛烈，不能使用通常的通訊工具，也放信鴿出去，傳遞軍書。</p>
<p>倫敦政府巳經將和平之鴿看作「衛國干城」。全國養鴿所有鴿子十萬頭，早已奉命為國效勞。國內所有的鴿販蓄養着「後備兵」一百多萬名，都向政府登記，願意將他們的全部傳書鴿，統歸政府調遣。政府替他們更費裝設電話，以便立刻向政府報告從前綫帶回的緊急消息。</p>
<p>從前英國政府不許人民射殺捉鴿的老騰，但是現在不論老鷹小鷹，一概格　勿論。政府又勸人民不可貪圖口福，殺鴿充飢。官方在一件正式文告中說：「目前肉類固受統制，鴿之値，僅一先令左右，然此種家禽所傳文書，我國空軍將士之生命繫焉！」不睬這件文告的饕餮，應處以罰金一百元或徒刑三個月，可見政府如何重視鴿子。</p>
<p>全國養鴿所練大批信鴿，使牠們能飛波六百英里的海陸。最近有一隻信鴿，竟從姿內　拉飛到紐約，全程三千英里，費時十五個月。在短距離的「航程」中，信鴿靠着順風，能維持每分鐘一英里的速度。但是在畏途飛行中，平均速度是每小時三十五哩至四十哩。鴿販有時用絕妙的方法，訓練信鴿。孵蛋的雌鴿，由於母愛的本能，急急忙忙地飛回原處。小鴿孵化兩星期以後，雄鴿思家心切，也會拚命地飛。異性的鴿子分開了幾日，彼此都很思戀，所以急欲團聚。這些都是信鴿在回程中增加速度的原因。</p>
<p>每一頭信鴿「服現役」的時候，足部縛着種金屬製的管子。管子的表而有塊空白的地方，為書寫急促的文書之用。寫得從從容容而較長的文書，可以藏在管子內部。</p>
<p>飛機師杵飛行中放出鴿子，不是一件很容易的事，因為高空的風力，往往達每小時三百多英里，飛機帥倘使放得不小心，弱小的生命是擋不住那中勁風的。最妥當的法子是用報紙裹住鴿十，將牠們的兩翼緊緊地摺在兩旁。報紙在空上吠開以後，牠們就可以振翅遠飛了。</p>
<p>信鴿怎麽會有傳書的本領？這個問題到如今還沒有滿意的解答。有人說：這完全是本能作用，因為牠們胆小，不喜歡寂寞，願意和父母子女團聚。日光和氣味對於牠們都不生影響。較可信的一種理論是地面的磁力作用使它們識得歸途。無綫電台廣播的時候，鴿子沒法在它的周圍辨識方向，空中雷電交作的時候，鴿子也不識東西。</p>

<p>「這個我知道，現在七爺可曾放出來沒有？」趙四敎他別性急，今兒的玉崑，偏是特別的性急。</p>
<p>一本來大家都說他有錢有勢的人，最多過一堂就完了；那知前三天判決，那個混帳的狗官，竟判了他十六個月；說氣人不氣人？最奇怪三爺是他叔父，叉是目今有名的帶兵頭兒，也不想法子把他保出來！」玉崑道才完全明白了。「好得很！」人到了無可奈何的時候，往往會說出這樣運自已也莫名其妙的話來。</p>
<p>趙四突然站起身來，把原是壓在一個硯池下面的兩張寫滿了字的信紙遞給玉崑。</p>
<p>「道幾天我就一個人在家裏好好淸查了一下，除掉人欠欠人的帳我不很淸楚以外，旁的東西，不論値錢不値錢，我都一古腦兒的開在上面了！」他一面在屋子裏來來回回的走着，一面這樣說：「停一會你可以再點一點。」</p>
<p>不料玉崑看也不看，便把那兩張信紙往口袋裏塞了進去。</p>
<p>「不忙，道個是小事1我們最好先去望望實七爺，老三還有幾句話耍我向他交代。」話沒有說完，他的身子已打座位上站起來了。「四爺，現在就請你伴我去走一遭成嗎？」</p>
<p>「怎麼不成！」　四來不及的答應，可是他回頭一望窗外的陽光，不由立刻皺起了眉毛來，因為胖子原是沒有一個不怕熱的。</p>
<p>玉崑一心想見袁紹文，那裏還顧得他怕熱不怕熱，當下一陣子催着他穿起長衣，囑咐了家裹留下的兩個年老的下人幾句，便忽忽同走出大門去。</p>

<p>讀了五月十日瑩女士的『我不像個大學生，」給了我很深的印象，不僅因為它反映了孤易敎育腐敗的一面，也因為它表露出我們對「大學生」三個字的疑問。</p>
<p>瑩女士所寫的她所小像的「大學生」是怎樣的呢？是濃裝艷抺，塗口紅，染指甲，整天只知自已裝飾和享樂，不讀書，不過打着「大學生」招牌的一些人們，這些是否可以代表「大學生」呢？當然不是的。</p>
<p>我以為大學生至少應該是：不僅要學習一種專門的技能和學術，也要培養適合於人羣生活的高尙的人格，對於文化有正確的了解，集體的研究和工作，實事求是地追求眞理的精神，眞誠而不虛偽，切實而不誇張的言行，不應死記公式和筆記，而是應用科學的方法</p>

<p>名伶周信芳於五月六日因休養而報演之後，海星社報道中曾有言曰：「周氏之休養時期或將延長，甚至現下不能決定其重演之期，蓋並非單純的為健康問題云。」而今言菊朋演期已滿，在「中旅」與電影過渡以後，周氏仍將　續休養，出演者則爲平角徐東明徐東霞，嗣後該院且有步黃金後塵，專邀平角之內定，至黃金榮邀章遏雲事，近日已不談起。</p>

<p>偶然經過周信芳君住宅的鬥口，不覺想起了多時未演戲的當代紅伶，為了渴望知道一點周君的近况，因此高興地以友誼關係作一次私人的訪問。</p>
<p>當在大門上輕輕地敲了二下，一個男傭開門來詢問我們，當薛維翰君把卡片給他遞入後不多時，周君親自來鬥口，表示着熱烈的歡迎，</p>
<p>在我們很愉快地握了一次手後，周君很客氣地引導我們到一間陳設幽雅的客廳內坐下，彼此寒暄了一番，我們的談話，就正式開始了。</p>
<p>薛君：「周先生近日的休息，聽說與身體有關，未知確否？」</p>
<p>周君：一的確為了傷塞症後沒有復原；身體相當衰弱，醫生說，不宜連續演戲，必須休息一下，正巧言菊朋先生南來，我就借此調養調養。」</p>
<p>薛君：「這麽說，周先生須在言先生北返之　，再行登台吧？」</p>
<p>周君：「不，我需較長時間的休息；在言先生北返之後，或者還要請別人代替登台。</p>
<p>薛君：「那末，周先生在什麽時候可以登台呢？」周君：「恐怕……至少耍有一二個月的休養，可能的話，也許延至秋天登台。」</p>
<p>薛君：「先生休假期內，對外界一切的應酬都謝　吧？」</p>
<p>周君：「是的，外界的應酬很多，有的邀我聚餐，也有請我演義務戲，我心裹雖然很想參加，可是事　上難以如願。」</p>
<p>筆者：「王熙春小姐也須長期的休假嗎？」</p>
<p>周君：「當然她也需耍長期的休假，以免太忙的工作，影響了她的健康。」</p>
<p>筆者：一周先生身體雖然欠佳，看上精神倒還不差。」</p>
<p>周君：「那是我們暢談之後，精神興奮的緣故啊！」</p>
<p>薛君：「周先生陪了我們好久，恐怕很疲乏了，我們想就此告辭可。」</p>
<p>講到這　，我們　向周君告別而去，君很客氣，親自送出了大門。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Twenty-Seven Japanese Planes Attacked Again Yesterday, British Embassy and French Consulate Suffered, British Embassy Hit by Seven Bombs with Heavy Damage, French Consulate and French Church Were Destroyed <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The British Embassy buildings in Chongqing, which were painted a striking light yellow in 1929 to prevent them from becoming targets of air raids, were bombed again today. Japanese planes also bombed the western district of the city and the Jiangbei (transliteration) area, killing more than fifty people and injuring more than three hundred, the highest casualty rate this year. The British Embassy buildings, which were specially painted in a conspicuous color to make them easily recognizable by Japanese planes, unexpectedly became the best target for air raids. Since 1939, they have been bombed four times. The French Consulate and the French Church near the British Embassy also suffered damage, as Japanese planes fiercely bombed the entire consulate alley. Half of the French Consulate building has been destroyed, and the French Church has been shaken. A total of six bombs hit the British Embassy, one of which exploded and was a heavy bomb. The office of British Ambassador Kerr, the residences of embassy staff, and the house occupied by the British Embassy's Chinese Counselor, Mr. and Mrs. Blacker, were all damaged. One bomb directly hit the embassy's air-raid shelter, but no one was injured. The ambassador and embassy staff were sheltering in the ambassador's private air-raid shelter at the top of a small hill west of Chongqing. However, the ambassador's secretary, Mr. McShine, was in the embassy's air-raid shelter. He did not feel much when the bomb directly hit the air-raid shelter, but a bomb broke the embassy's main water pipe, causing a large amount of water to flow into the air-raid shelter. Today's Japanese planes launched their second attack on Chongqing in two days. Twenty-seven Japanese planes attacked. It seemed that more bombs were dropped in the city center today than yesterday. The air raid began at 10:10 a.m., but the alarm was raised at 9:20 a.m. and not lifted until 1:10 p.m. Most of the Japanese planes concentrated on the west side of the city, where shops and residences were destroyed even more severely than during yesterday's attack. It is reported that a poorly constructed air-raid shelter had its entrance directly hit by a bomb, resulting in twenty-two deaths and two injuries. The Jiangbei area north of the Jialing River was also severely bombed, with many casualties. According to the Air Defense Headquarters, the known deaths have reached twenty-two, and the injured number sixty-two, but this number is not yet complete. Since the casualties were the heaviest this year, the Air Defense Headquarters has issued a public announcement warning people not to stay outside the air-raid shelters, to avoid endangering their lives. The office of the Sino-German joint venture Eurasia Aviation Corporation was also slightly damaged by the shock. A police station was destroyed, and a Catholic hospital and a municipal hospital were also hit. The residence of the Chinese Counselor of the British Embassy suffered heavy damage. Doors and windows were blown out, and the roof and walls were pierced by shrapnel. A large bomb landed fifteen feet from the counselor's residence. About twenty bombs fell within 150 yards of the British Embassy. The embassy's main water pipe was broken, and water splashed everywhere. In 1939, the British Embassy was painted a striking yellow so that Japanese pilots could see it from the air. The British Embassy also notified the Japanese side of this special method of preventing attacks. However, since taking this step, bombs have often fallen on the British Embassy. An hour after the bombing, a United Press reporter saw the Chinese Counselor and his wife of the British Embassy happily engaged in cleaning up. The husband wiped books and lamps, while the wife swept the floor. The counselor said, "This is the fourth time this house has been hit. Fortunately, the roof was not severely damaged, so we are still safe. After going through several bombing seasons, we know we don't need much." (United Press dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Twenty-seven Japanese planes dropped many bombs in Consulate Alley in Chongqing this morning. The British Embassy was heavily damaged, and the French Consulate was destroyed. A total of seven bombs hit the British Embassy, and the French Consulate was directly hit. Many bombs fell in the area, and many nearby houses were destroyed. (Reuters dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Twenty-seven Japanese planes from Chongqing disturbed the city from the border of Hubei Province on the 2nd. They invaded the city's airspace around 10:00 a.m. Chinese anti-aircraft forces fiercely fired upon them. The Japanese planes hastily dropped more than 200 large bombs and fled. More than 100 Chinese houses were destroyed, and dozens of people were killed or injured. (Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Twenty-seven Japanese planes from Chongqing flew in to bomb again this morning, dropping bombs in the same area that was bombed yesterday. (Havas dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>During the Japanese attack on Chongqing on the 1st, the buildings of the Catholic Church suffered the greatest damage. Most of the front yard and main hall of the Zhenhou Church, the bishop's office, and the kitchen were destroyed. Also, the Cimu Church, the only remaining church in Chongqing after the bombings, was completely destroyed, with losses amounting to no less than hundreds of thousands. (Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>It was learned in Chongqing today that during the Japanese attack on Chengdu two weeks ago, American missionary Dudley was slightly wounded by shrapnel. However, he has gradually recovered. (Taiwanese Public dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>The French Catholic Cathedral of Notre Dame in Chongqing, formerly the only Catholic church here that had not been damaged, was almost completely destroyed in yesterday's bombing. When the alarm sounded, five hundred people were attending Mass in the church. They rushed to the air-raid shelter to hide. After everyone had left, the church was bombed and destroyed. There were no casualties. (United Press dispatch on the 2nd)</p>

<p>In order to relieve the unemployment of righteous people, the Guangdong Provincial Government in Shaoguan is planning to establish reclamation areas. Two years ago, it sent Commissioner Qian Shufen to the United States to convey the government's intentions. As a result, a total of 6,050,000 yuan in national currency was donated, and more than 1,370,000 yuan has been remitted back to the province in succession. The Guangdong Relief Association has formulated a plan to establish reclamation areas separately, with each reclamation area named after overseas Chinese from a certain place as a memorial. These include the New York Overseas Chinese Reclamation Area in Xuwen County, the Honolulu Overseas Chinese Reclamation Area in Chayong, Yangshan County, the Chicago Overseas Chinese Reclamation Area in Daji, Taishan County, the New York-London Overseas Chinese Reclamation Area in Zoumaping, Yingde County, the San Francisco Overseas Chinese Reclamation Area in Maba, Qujiang County, the Jicai Overseas Chinese Reclamation Area in Darenshan, Enping County, the Washington D.C.

<p>Singapore A reliable and well-informed Dutch source declared today that the Dutch East Indies is now less concerned about the threat of possible aggression than in the past, because the Dutch East Indies' defense preparations are constantly improving. The latest and best defense plan is to build four hundred motor torpedo boats. These torpedo boats are equipped with American-made aircraft motors and can travel 52 miles per hour. The Dutch side pointed out that the Dutch East Indies' shipbuilding facilities cannot build ships exceeding 15,000 tons. Therefore, the Dutch East Indies is focusing on building small ships. The Dutch East Indies has abundant materials necessary for these small ships. The Dutch East Indies' air force is also extremely powerful and has long-range bombers made in the United States. Warehouses throughout the Dutch East Indies are now full of goods that can be exported. These goods have been stagnating here due to a lack of space, but the lack of space will not last long, because the government is now repairing and re-equipping many Dutch merchant ships that have been idle in Dutch East Indies ports for a long time. The repair work is currently being actively carried out day and night in various ports that seagoing vessels can reach. The Dutch side also said that the Dutch East Indies hopes that economic negotiations with Japan will be concluded soon, but insists that supplies shipped to Japan cannot exceed pre-war levels.

<h3 id="e20">Medical Association Holds Epidemic Prevention Movement <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Medical Association has recently joined hands with physicians and hospitals who are enthusiastic about serving society to hold a one-month epidemic prevention movement in order to realize the ideal of immunization. It is gratifying to see this initiative at a time when the public's medical problems are most serious and difficult to solve.</p>
<p>The significance of this move lies not only in the physicians' sacrifice of a small portion of their time, energy, and valuable medicines, but also in the physicians' promotion of their spirit of service and morality, not focusing on their own individual medical practice, but caring about public health, and achieving the highest purpose of medicine. To prevent disease before it occurs is commendable, rather than treating it after it has developed. The general mentality knows only "to seek medical treatment in a panic when sick," but does not know the importance of daily health maintenance and the effectiveness of preventive medicine. Now that we have the advocacy of physicians, it will not only arouse public attention, but also only when physicians give instructions to patients can it penetrate people's hearts, gain unwavering trust, and be passed on from person to person without the need for coercion. Its effectiveness is self-evident and unmatched by ordinary methods. Cultivating the habit of preventing epidemics is indeed a blessing for the public. If, because of epidemic prevention injections, one indulges in sensual pleasures and gluttony, thinking that there is nothing to worry about, it is a great mistake. One must know that the onset of disease is due to a weak constitution, irregular diet, and erratic daily life, which weakens the original resistance and gives demons the opportunity to invade. Therefore, at the time of epidemic prevention injections, physicians should also deeply advise on the ways to maintain health and protect against disease. Otherwise, they will use epidemic prevention to help them harm their bodies and ruin their morals. Is this the original intention of preventing disease?</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the past, epidemic prevention injections were often not selective. They did not ask about the state of their body and mind, nor did they ask whether they were sick or not, but only knew to take compulsory action. As a result, there were cases of lingering in bed or even causing other diseases. Because of their unsound physiology or existing diseases, they even lost their lives. As for suppuration and erosion, it is a minor matter. How can this be said to be medical prevention or a strategy for public health? It is simply treating them like rabbits and mice, treating them like cattle and horses, and simply doing immunization experiments for them, eliminating the psychological fear of terror and plague, and seeking spiritual self-comfort. Now, the Medical Association's epidemic prevention movement "must be injected three times before a certificate is issued; a diagnosis must be made before the injection is given; a contraindication certificate must be issued to those who cannot be injected; strict disinfection must be carried out to prevent the occurrence of abscesses after the injection." The so-called "reasonable epidemic prevention injection" is worthy of its name. However, physicians are busy with their daily medical practice, and epidemic prevention injections can be entrusted to nurses. But since a diagnosis must be made before the injection, it is necessary to follow the name and verify the reality, not to be bothered by the procedure and neglect to perform it. Moreover, the voluntary action should not be shown slight neglect, nor should it be arrogant. It is necessary to make those who come feel grateful, and those who have not come feel envious. Therefore, in dealing with people, we should also show an attitude of kindness and love. Since it is called a "movement," its only goal is to have more people know and more people be immunized. Therefore, it should be publicized in many ways so that everyone has the opportunity to know. Moreover, the injection time of each physician cannot be consistent, so as to avoid enthusiastic immunizers from running around a lot. The Medical Association should issue a paper card to the physician in charge of epidemic prevention injection, and post it in the alley or outside the clinic, indicating the physician's name and injection time, as well as the start and end dates, and it does not hurt to attach texts and patterns of epidemic prevention propaganda. This can make anyone who comes for a diagnosis or passes by hear and see, and then add the power of mutual transmission to spread far and wide. The promotion will be faster. On the one hand, it is still hoped that the members of the Medical Association will actively participate, so that the whole work will be completed. This is indeed an immortal act. If the cause of benefiting the masses is carried out continuously, the public's faith in Western medicine will naturally be deeply rooted, and the indirect effect will not be slight.</p>
<p>However, since the prices of all commodities have soared, physicians are a free professional class. In addition, the soaring price of medicines makes the increase in medical expenses an unavoidable fact. However, the importance of medical care in life is no less than that of food and fuel, and life and death depend on it. However, the current medical expenses have been unbearable for the general wage-earning class. Even a normal delivery costs five hundred yuan, and a tonsillectomy costs a thousand gold. Although this is a very small number, it is enough to make people gasp. As for inpatient treatment, it costs thousands of gold. The expenses of each hospital are huge, and perhaps it is thought that it is not enough. Wealthy patients do not care. However, most patients often spend all their money on a single illness, leaving them bankrupt. Moreover, disease does not choose between rich and poor, and it is easier for those who work hard and have poor nutrition to get sick. Physicians are also a professional class, and they must know the hardships of the industry. How to solve the current public medical problems is also an unavoidable responsibility for the medical community today.</p>
<h3 id="e21">U.S. Congressional Figures Welcome U.S. Cancellation of Special Privileges in China, Recognizing This as a Correct Diplomatic Action and Consistent with the President's Lend-Lease Position <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Diplomatic circles in Washington yesterday considered the cancellation of consular jurisdiction in China as one of the goals of the United States' Far Eastern peace efforts. This move was warmly welcomed by Congress, which regarded it as clear evidence of the United States' policy of non-interference in the Far East. Even congressional leaders who normally do not sympathize with the government's diplomatic policies praised Secretary of State Hull's exchange of notes with Dr. Quo Tai-chi. They also lauded Hull's straightforward statement to the press that consular jurisdiction in China would be abolished as soon as peace was restored. Experts analyzing the current situation believe that Hull's statement is the first to express a correct stance on U.S. Far Eastern policy beyond the mantra of "maintaining the status quo." "Maintaining the status quo" is merely empty talk, far less powerful than taking correct action. It is also believed here that Hull's statement is related to the statement made by Foreign Minister Eden last week. It is believed by many that Eden's statement last week hinted at the basis for peace negotiations in Europe and Asia. Some people believe that if China wins, it will become a major power in East Asia, more dangerous than present-day Japan. Therefore, they are very skeptical about Hull's declaration and hope that the U.S. State Department will preserve the current commercial privileges in China. Senator Gillette of Iowa (a veteran member of the Foreign Relations Committee) declared, "The consular jurisdiction and other privileges extorted from China by Western countries have always been intolerable to China and are clearly a violation of China's sovereignty and autonomy, with no just cause. Our country has already clarified its position on upholding the four freedoms of the world. We cannot in good conscience continue to maintain privileges in China that undermine the four freedoms that our country has guaranteed. Hull's statement is certainly in line with the position announced by the President and Congress in the Lend-Lease Act. We have vowed to aid all countries defending themselves, and China is at the forefront of national self-defense. We have clearly stated our pledge to aid them." Senator Nye of Indiana, who usually opposes the government's foreign policy, stated, "This statement is sufficient to show that U.S. Far Eastern policy has no imperialistic ideas whatsoever." Congressional leaders are less interested in the news that the United States will allow army pilots and technicians to go to China. The State Department denies that it has made preparations with the Chinese government for pilots to go to China. However, there seem to be many signs here that prove that the Army Department is acting independently and is not rejecting resignations of this nature. The number of people reporting to help China seems to be increasing. (United Press, 2nd)</p>

It is believed here that this move is sufficient to show that the U.S. export permit system in the Philippines will not completely cut off Japanese trade with the Philippines. Undersecretary of State Welles is scheduled to arrive here this afternoon on a clipper to assist Sayre in processing export permit applications.

<p>Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka recently issued a statement reiterating Japan's commitment to its obligations under the Axis alliance and denying that it is engaged in any understanding with the United States. Diplomatic figures here have interpreted this as the beginning of another diplomatic offensive by Matsuoka to place Japan in a superior position between the Axis powers and the United States, engaging in bargaining. Furthermore, the fact that Matsuoka's speech was delivered after meeting with German Ambassador to Japan General Ott is of particular significance. Since President Roosevelt of the United States delivered his speech, Germany has felt threatened in the Atlantic. It is quite possible that Ambassador Ott visited Matsuoka to request that Japan fulfill its alliance obligations in order to exert restraint. In addition, it is worth noting that Japanese newspapers have recently been promoting the idea that negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies have stalled, and that relations between the two sides are becoming increasingly strained. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Former Chairman of the Japan Times, Ashida, recently published an article in the English-language "Contemporary Review" reviewing Japan-U.S. relations, stating that there is little doubt that the United States will enter the war this summer or autumn. If so, Japan must adopt an extremely cautious attitude. The government authorities have consistently viewed the Japan-Germany-Italy alliance treaty as intended to prevent the United States from entering the war, and this is generally supported by the entire country. However, there are still many unclear aspects of our country's foreign policy among the people, and it is hoped that the government will pay special attention to the following three matters: (1) What the entire country most earnestly hopes for is to end the "China Incident" as soon as possible. (2) The people urgently want to understand the future direction of foreign policy and want to know whether war will break out between Japan and the United States. Although Prime Minister Konoe and Foreign Minister Matsuoka have made speeches on this matter, Americans still believe that Japan will follow in the footsteps of Hungary and Bulgaria in the Axis camp. This impression must be dispelled. (3) The Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact is not the final stage of mutual understanding, but only a preliminary test. (Havas, 1st)</p>

<p>Tokyo This week, Japanese newspapers have criticized British Foreign Secretary Eden's draft of British peace goals. The "Hochi Shimbun" discussed this issue, titling its article, "Eden Is Delusional; Is His Thinking Sound?" The English-language "Japan Times and Mail," which occasionally reflects the views of the Foreign Ministry, stated that Roosevelt had met with Eden before his speech, as it was certain that the U.S. government, which had provided such significant assistance to Britain, "even training aviation personnel," would inevitably participate in Britain's reconstruction process after the war. The "Hochi Shimbun" also stated that the various "freedoms" that Eden cited as the basis for peace were actually within Roosevelt's scope and were in fact issued by the President. The newspaper's editorial also stated that the facts are sufficient to prove that Britain's postwar goals are actually those advocated by Roosevelt. The United States is attempting to promote its ambition to dominate the world and oppose Germany's "New Order" within these four freedoms. It also said, "The President's words are already a little late, as Hitler has already advocated his views on the New World Order. However, in cooperation with President Churchill, British Foreign Secretary Eden expressed that what the people need more is freedom, while Chancellor Hitler believes that organization, system, and rationality are better." The newspaper claimed that Britain is attempting to re-impose the old Treaty of Versailles on Germany, the consequences of which we have already seen today. The "Hochi Shimbun" considered Eden's statement regarding the extension of the moral order to the Far East to be an "insult to Japan." As the newspaper claimed, Britain's past actions have already demonstrated that Britain is the public enemy of the Far East. The "Hochi Shimbun" also stated that the main goal of Japan's construction of a New Order in East Asia is to enable "every Eastern people to enjoy a suitable position." The newspaper also stated, "Therefore, we demand that the Anglo-Saxon countries, which have used the beautiful names of morality and humanity to drain the last drop of blood from the people of Asia, withdraw from the Far East. We should rebuild East Asia for the Asians." (United Press, 2nd)</p>

<p>Washington U.S. celebrity commentator Walter Lippmann issued an article yesterday, claiming that the U.S. has now reached the point of seeking ways to avoid a Pacific war with Japan, because given the current situation in the Atlantic, a Pacific war would be detrimental to the U.S. He also claimed that if we can engage in decisive and fair actions that mutually acknowledge the essential interests of the U.S., we can avoid a Pacific war. "We are militarily prepared to prevent the Japanese from interfering in the world war, and we have already made the necessary military agreements with China, Britain, Australia, the Netherlands and India. We also hold all kinds of economic warfare tools in our hands. We can conduct genuine negotiations in the Far East based on the honorable peace that China has achieved in the war, Japan's conclusion of new commercial treaties with the Dutch East Indies and the U.S., and including the Soviet Union, to eliminate the political basis of British, Japanese, and American imperialism in China. If the Japanese side responds favorably, we should voluntarily cancel the immigration restrictions on Japan, which hurt Japanese pride, to compensate Japan's current costly war, which is solely to please Hitler. Our efforts have a very good chance of success." (United Press, 2nd)</p>

<p>Tokyo American newspapers have recently claimed that Japan is becoming increasingly indifferent to the Tripartite Pact. The Yomiuri Shimbun refuted this today, stating that these remarks are clearly intended by President Roosevelt's cabinet to downplay Japan's position in the Pacific and prepare to move the strongest part of the Pacific Fleet to the Atlantic in order to avoid public protests. American newspapers have repeatedly stated that Japan does not want to fulfill its obligations under the Tripartite Pact and is preparing to abandon its southward advance policy. As a result, President Roosevelt is downplaying Japan's responsibility in the Pacific under the Axis alliance in the hope of driving the U.S. closer to entering the war. The U.S. government hopes to be able to transfer its strong fleet stationed in the Pacific to the Atlantic to reinforce the 165 aging ships already there. In fact, Japan is determined to fulfill its obligations to the Axis powers, and any action to the contrary would tarnish Japan's past glorious history. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<p>Tokyo Dr. Young, a famous American radio commentator, arrived in Yokohama yesterday aboard the Japanese mail ship Haruna Maru.

Dr. Young stressed that although the international situation feels tense, war will not break out in the Pacific. Of course, his position is not to speak on behalf of the U.S. government, but many prominent figures in U.S. political and financial circles feel that the United States needs to maintain friendly relations with Japan. He now plans to travel to Manchuria and various parts of China, but will not go to Chongqing. Dr. Young also said that radio can greatly improve international relations. Many Americans are now listening to Japanese broadcasts to better understand Japanese affairs.

He entered the broadcasting industry in 1925 and has traveled to 53 countries, meeting many monarchs, presidents, and foreign politicians. This time, he will first go to Japan and then travel to Australia and South Africa as a traveling reporter for the National Broadcasting Company of the United States.

If this method proves successful, it will be very effective in defending the countries of South America and Greenland. In addition, the United States is actively manufacturing tanks these days, and a large number of products are expected to be produced within six months, which can be used by the army to teach soldiers. It is hoped that the quantity will exceed demand. (Havas, 1st)</p>

<h3 id="e34">End of the Crete Campaign: British Troops Retreat to Egypt; Control of the Dardanelles; Turkey Surrounded by the Axis <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>London: The German conquest of Crete and the British troop withdrawal, as announced by the British War Office, have been confirmed. Subsequently, the Germans will be able to advance on Cyprus, Britain's last stronghold in the eastern Mediterranean. At that point, the distance for the German air force to attack the major port of Alexandria in Egypt will be less than 400 miles. British Prime Minister Churchill had previously vowed to defend Crete to the death. The abandonment of the island is a severe blow to the British people. The fact that 15,000 overseas troops rescued from Crete are being transported to Egypt instead of Cyprus has caused considerable surprise in some quarters, as it is widely known that Hitler's next move will be to attack Cyprus. Well-informed sources emphasize the high cost of this German victory in terms of lives, machinery, and time. However, the British losses are also significant, with the number of British casualties being the highest since the Dunkirk evacuation. If the deaths of Greek soldiers are included, the casualties are proportionally the highest since the beginning of the war. The abandonment of Crete is the fifth retreat for the British army, the previous four being Norway, Dunkirk, British Somaliland, and Greece. Only Somaliland has been retaken by British forces. This retreat is undoubtedly a severe blow to Britain in the overall war effort, particularly concerning Turkey's position. It is widely known that a "struggle for oil" is about to unfold in the Near East, and the Axis powers have now surrounded Turkey. Hitler has effectively gained control of the Dardanelles Strait and now has the power to compel the Turkish President to follow his orders. Furthermore, the support of the Arab nations, on which Britain relies, is now teetering. According to recent reports, the chiefs in the Near and Middle East are adopting a cautious wait-and-see attitude towards the war, awaiting future developments. The fact that the Germans were able to conquer Crete using only airborne troops, without any naval support, has sparked speculation here. How likely is it that the British can defend Cyprus? (United Press dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Cairo: The British navy and air force cooperated once again to successfully evacuate British and Allied troops from Crete. This evacuation was similar to the British retreat from Greece. British fighter planes repelled German dive bombers, while British warships sailed across the Mediterranean to safety. It is believed that the British War Office's announcement of the withdrawal of 15,000 troops from Crete refers only to British and British Empire forces, and does not include Greek troops who may have already been evacuated. The number of Dominion troops among the evacuated British forces is currently unknown. The total number of British troops on Crete, and whether the evacuation is complete, remain to be seen. Well-informed sources say that the urgency of the evacuation was dictated by the disparity in distance between British and German air bases and Crete. It is widely believed that at least some German prisoners of war captured on Crete have been taken to Egypt. London sources believe that New Zealand General Freyberg likely withdrew with his troops at the same time. A British air force official estimates that the Germans used approximately 1,000 aircraft in Crete, several hundred of which were destroyed. German paratroopers are not to be feared; it was not the paratroopers who captured Maleme and allowed the Germans to land, but rather German bombers and fighters. The airborne troops transported by air were the real danger, not the paratroopers. Based on opinions from Greece and Crete, low-flying fighters are far more fearsome than dive bombers. In the official's personal opinion, this war is an air war, and future battles will be even more so. While the German success in Crete has further complicated matters for Britain, no other terrain is quite like Crete. If the Germans attempt to advance further, they will encounter greater resistance and face a heavier burden. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: This afternoon, German military reports claimed that the battle of Crete has ended. The last British naval base on the island, Sfakia, was captured by German forces yesterday. British troops who stubbornly defended the northern mountains of Sfakia, making a last stand, were overcome by German mountain troops, and 3,000 enemy soldiers were captured. The German air force assisted the army in completing the task of clearing out the remaining enemy. German aircraft attacked the British fleet, hitting a destroyer with three bombs, which eventually sank. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>German and Italian Forces Join Up, Conduct Clearing Operations</p>
<p>Berlin: Well-informed sources here commented yesterday on the joint German-Italian advance on Crete, saying that this approach could be described as "separate advances, joint attack," similar to the attack on Yugoslavia. German and Italian forces have joined up at Ierapetra. After the port was occupied, the British had no way to retreat, and all attempts by the British to retreat from other locations failed. After British troops in Stenikia were bombed, several tanks caught fire. The German air force's operational range has now expanded to the coast of North Africa. A ship carrying military supplies was sunk off the south coast of Crete. The Battle of Crete can now be considered over. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command announced yesterday that the final mopping-up operation on Crete "is progressing smoothly." The announcement stated that approximately 10,000 British and Greek prisoners had been taken. The announcement also stated that German bombers attacked British light warships off the south coast of Crete, and a Royal Navy destroyer was hit and severely damaged. Furthermore, three British "Hurricane" aircraft were shot down, while the Germans suffered no losses. (United Press dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: British troops withdrew from Heraklion, Crete, on May 29. Military correspondent Büchsas's account of the German paratrooper operations has been brought back to Berlin. Excerpts from the correspondent's diary are as follows: May 20: German paratroopers landed near Heraklion amidst intense anti-aircraft fire. At night, British forces bombarded the small hill occupied by the Germans with artillery. May 21: With the assistance of aircraft, German forces repeatedly attacked the airfield, destroying several British aircraft. German aircraft dropped ammunition and food in the afternoon. May 22: German forces received a large supply of ammunition, food, and medical supplies. German forces continued to strafe British troops with machine guns. The commander of the Heraklion garrison requested the Germans to surrender in the afternoon, to which the Germans responded by bombing the city. German aircraft bombed the gasoline depots at the airfield, causing a large fire. British troops attacked the German rear, killing 15, while German troops suffered two fatalities. May 24: A British Hurricane aircraft attacked German positions. German aircraft heavily bombed the city and the airfield. Transport aircraft continued to drop supplies. German patrols captured several more prisoners. May 25-27: German forces attacked the airfield with great success. Patrols engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat, capturing many prisoners. May 28: German forces received orders to attack the city of Heraklion and the airfield the following day. German forces launched a heavy attack on the city, with considerable success. May 29: Patrols reported that the British forces had withdrawn, and German forces immediately occupied the city. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German News Agency announced yesterday that German and Italian forces on Crete have linked up and now only need to clear out the remaining British and Greek forces in the center of the island, a task that should be completed in just a few days. (United Press dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>The British People Expected the Unfavorable Development</p>
<p>London: Although the British people do not tend to underestimate the intensity of the Battle of Crete, the reaction to the campaign's course differs greatly from what the Germans expected. The entire British public is fully aware of Crete's strategic importance and the ferocity of the German attack. Moreover, a week earlier, the British knew that the British and Greek forces on Crete were in a precarious situation due to a lack of air cover. Recalling the rapid advance of Nazi troops into the Netherlands and other places, they were prepared for the worst-case scenario and knew that news of the end of the Battle of Crete might arrive any day. The fact that the battle lasted for several more days and that the well-trained and elite German forces suffered heavy casualties caused the British to admire the courage of the Allied forces and to learn various lessons from the campaign, such as the need to strengthen the protection of British airfields. The general opinion of the British people today seems to be that although British troops have withdrawn from Crete, developments in the Near East have not brought Hitler significantly closer to his ultimate goal. Hitler has been working hard to expand his soldiers and aircraft, stockpile gasoline, and order all German churches to offer special prayers for the Nazi forces on the battlefield until the end of the war. This can be seen as clear evidence of the Germans' efforts to encourage their troops and prevent morale from declining when news of heavy losses arrives. As Churchill announced a few days ago, while German dive bombers have had some success in attacking British ships, there is absolutely no question that the British navy's position in the Mediterranean has been damaged. Furthermore, the British have fought hard to defend Crete for so long that the situation in other key centers in the Near East has turned in Britain's favor. While defending Crete, British aircraft from East Africa have been redeployed to other operations, tanks have been inspected and expanded, and the situation in Iraq has been clarified. All of this has provided the British with powerful encouragement and greatly dispelled concerns about the fate of British forces in Crete. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Fighting Fiercely for Two Months, Spirit Undiminished</p>
<p>Cairo: According to wounded soldiers arriving here from Crete, the island was still under heavy fighting when British troops withdrew last Saturday. At that time, the British rearguard held strong positions in the mountains. Although enemy dive bombers and other aircraft still filled the sky, they had difficulty targeting British positions. Shortly before their departure, a village was bombed for two hours, with 300 bombs dropped, destroying everything. New Zealand General Freyberg is now confirmed to be safe and still leading his troops in battle. According to German reports, the general had been killed in action. A military spokesman in Cairo commented on the British withdrawal from the island, saying that British troops were prepared to fight to the death, but since the campaign had exceeded the value of holding the island, it was decided to withdraw. If the British had not put up such a glorious fight, the overall situation in the Middle East might have deteriorated. Although British losses on the island were significant, it is nothing short of a miracle that 15,000 men were able to withdraw safely under heavy enemy pressure. It has been learned that a British warship slipped into a port in the heart of the Middle East on May 29, carrying the first batch of weary troops away from Crete. These were New Zealand troops, who had been fighting fiercely against the Germans in Greece and Crete for two months, yet their spirit remained undiminished. Subsequently, ships loaded with other soldiers sailed away in the dark, and the sounds of bugles and soldiers cheering could be heard from afar. Nothing could break their morale. A New Zealand soldier said that the weather on the island was truly terrible, either raining or snowing, and sometimes even hailing. When they traveled day and night to the coast, they were subjected to unprecedentedly heavy attacks from specialized German forces. Many of the withdrawing troops were wounded and had only received the most basic treatment in the field. They all recounted the barbarity of the German troops. Another New Zealand soldier said that water was very scarce on the island. Soldiers lined up side by side to quench their thirst, heedless of the German dive bombers' machine gun bullets raining down. A British naval officer recounted seeing a marine commander single-handedly use the last of his anti-aircraft guns to drive off German dive bombers while standing in front of burning trees near Kania, a truly remarkable feat of bravery.

<h3 id="e35">Strong Protest to Germany After South Ireland Was Bombed; Demanding Compensation for Deaths, Injuries, and Damages; Guaranteeing No Further Violation of Airspace and Territorial Waters <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Dublin: The official gazette of the South Irish government stated that the bombs that fell on Dublin on Saturday morning came from Germany. A strong protest has been lodged with the German government, demanding compensation. As a result of the bombing that morning, at least 27 people were killed, about 80 were injured, and property damage was considerable. Another bomb fell near Arklow in South Ireland on Sunday morning, but there were no fatalities, although property suffered slight damage. An investigation has revealed that all the bombs came from Germany. Therefore, the South Irish chargé d'affaires in Berlin has been instructed to protest to the German government in the strongest possible terms, objecting to the violation of South Irish territory, demanding compensation for the deaths, injuries, and property losses, and requesting a firm guarantee from the German government to issue strict orders to prevent German aircraft from flying over South Irish airspace and territorial waters. Furthermore, it was learned last night that 27 people were killed in the Dublin bombing. The search for the dead and wounded is continuing. Twenty houses were completely destroyed, 55 were severely damaged, and 300 people were made homeless. The Independent newspaper reported on Sunday that "We are confident that Mr. de Valera will visit the bombed area yesterday to express his sympathy to the victims, and then make a strong protest to the belligerent countries concerned. Since the start of the war, South Ireland has strictly adhered to neutrality and has the right to demand that any belligerent country not violate its territory and airspace."

<p>Detailed Damage from Bombing of German Territory</p>
<p>London: The British Air Ministry's Information Department released details of the damage suffered by Hamburg, Kiel, and Wilhelmshaven in Germany, saying that news of the terrifying power of the latest British bombs had spread throughout Germany. The German authorities then published details of the damage inflicted on London, making comparisons in the hope of reducing public panic. When Hamburg was bombed, a new type of giant bomb destroyed a factory in the Steinwarder industrial area, covering approximately 20,000 square yards. Other areas were also heavily damaged, which caused the Germans to tremble with fear. News from Germany stated that the scenes in Hamburg were heartbreaking and shocking, and that there was hardly any district in Germany's second-largest city that had not been bombed. Hamburg was repeatedly subjected to heavy bombing by British aircraft using giant bombs in May, and the details of the damage are still unknown. However, reconnaissance aircraft photographs show that 36 large factories in the area have been completely destroyed or severely damaged, and many more have suffered minor damage. After a British air raid on Mannheim on May 5, troops were deployed around the chemical factory in the Ruhrort industrial area on the outskirts of the city, and ambulances left the factory in an endless stream throughout the day. The damage to Mannheim's shipyards was also severe. Sixteen warehouses on both sides of the Feudenheim Canal were completely destroyed, and the warehouses along the Rhine were also completely burned. After a recent attack, British aircraft flew to reconnaissance the following day and still saw the embers being extinguished with water. The eastern end of a large bridge over the river had been destroyed and had fallen into the river, blocking traffic. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>British Air Force Battle Results</p>
<p>London: British authorities claimed yesterday that since the outbreak of the Middle East war, 1,696 Axis aircraft have been destroyed in various theaters, while British losses during the same period amounted to only 260 aircraft. The figures for Axis aircraft losses are estimated at the lowest possible limit and do not include aircraft destroyed on the ground. In May alone, the Germans lost 258 aircraft in the Middle East, while the British lost 59. The authorities also claimed that 204 German aircraft were shot down during attacks on Britain in May, while 67 British aircraft were destroyed over Europe. (United Press dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<p>London: Commentators and military specialists in prominent London newspapers suggested today that Britain should take the initiative to attack Syria to protect Cyprus, lest it become the next battlefield. They pointed out that if Syria were in British hands, the defense of Cyprus would obviously be easier. If the Germans gain a foothold in Syria, it will be extremely difficult to defend Cyprus. Cyprus is the third-largest island in the Mediterranean, after Sicily and Sardinia. Disraeli once called it "the western part of Asia." News from Cairo states that the main condition of the British-Iraqi armistice is the implementation of the British-Iraqi Treaty, according to which British troops can enter Iraq at will, which is of considerable importance. Militarily, it is very beneficial for British troops to occupy Syria, as it would place them on the southern flank of Turkey, with a loyal Iran behind them. The military specialist of the Daily Telegraph declared, "We clearly have the strength to do this, and this possible operation would be welcomed by the majority of the French forces there. The new German threat is almost certain to come from that direction, so it should be brought under control in advance." The commentators pointed out that the Germans could use Rhodes, Cyprus, and Crete as bases to launch attacks on British oilfields in Iraq and Iran and the Suez Canal, and could use the German and Italian forces in Libya in a pincer movement to exert pressure. The British offensive triangle used to be Crete, Cyprus, and Alexandria, but with Crete occupied by the Germans, the British position has naturally deteriorated, especially as the ability to defend Cyprus has not yet been determined. British commentators seem to believe that Cyprus is easier to defend than Crete because the British have sufficient airfields there (it is said that the main reason for the failure in Crete was the lack of airfields), and because it is closer to British air bases in Palestine and Egypt and further from German bases in Greece, unlike Crete. Cyprus has the most natural airfield in the world, called Mesaoria, located in the center of the island, which is a 400,000-acre plain without a single tree that could be used as a base for attack, as well as being an ideal location for troop carriers and gliders to land. The British also have other air bases on Cyprus, namely Nicosia and Larnaca, the latter being a southeastern port city, which is important. British commentators claim that if sufficient air defenses can be established at these bases, the resulting firewall would be enough to prevent aircraft from carrying out an airborne invasion. This firewall could also provide the necessary protection for fighter planes operating from Cyprus. It is understood here that a large army is stationed in Cyprus, most of whom are Australian and New Zealand troops. The commentators also pointed out that Cyprus is 600 miles from Greece, beyond the range of dive bombers, but the island of Rhodes, which has five airfields, is only 200 miles away.

Government officials were all at the airfield to greet him. It is generally expected that the new cabinet will be formed tomorrow. (Havas dispatch from the 1st)</p>
<p>Since the British and Iraqi sides have signed a ceasefire agreement, hostilities have completely ceased. The Iraqi Regent, who fled when Ali Gailani launched the coup, returned to Baghdad yesterday. At that time, Iraqi dignitaries, the British Ambassador, and the British military mission all came to welcome him. The people gave him a warm welcome. Shortly after the Regent entered the capital, he held a reception. Guests included the American Minister, Mr. Knobloch, etc. It is heard that the young King of Iraq, Faisal (only six years old), is safe in the capital. The previous rumor that Ali Gailani had taken the King out of the country has been found to be inaccurate. It is also heard that the director of the Mosul oilfield strongly opposed Ali Gailani's actions. Therefore, well-informed sources believe that the turmoil in Iraq has come to an end. According to a Vichy dispatch from Baghdad, the Mosul oilfields are undamaged and the situation in the Iraqi capital is peaceful. There has been no disturbance in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>Content of the Ceasefire Terms</p>
<p>The official ceasefire terms set by the British Commander-in-Chief are as follows: (1) Cessation of war; (2) Iraqi troops to return to peacetime garrisons, including troops stationed in Ramadi; (3) All British prisoners of war to be released, Axis prisoners of war detained in Iraqi territory, and Iraqi prisoners of war to be handed over to the Regent. These terms apply to the entire territory of Iraq. It is heard that the new Iraqi government will grant the British request to allow British troops to transit through Iraq, and the ceasefire agreement does not change the British government's relations with Iraq within the scope of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. As for the release of captured Iraqi and Axis soldiers, it is conditional on the prior release of all British prisoners of war. There is no question of a peace treaty between Britain and Iraq because it is not appropriate to wage war. The ceasefire agreement was signed by the Iraqi committee led by the citizens of Baghdad. Furthermore, the Air Ministry's Information Office announced that the British commander in Iraq praised the close cooperation between the land and air forces, saying that the British Air Force launched a fierce attack on the Iraqi army's machine gun and artillery positions on Friday, which ultimately broke the morale of the Iraqi army. Shortly thereafter, the Iraqi army asked the British Ambassador to inquire about the British ceasefire terms. (Reuters dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<p>American Minister Protects British Nationals</p>
<p>When the Iraqi rebels occupied Baghdad, they planned to use the British people who had taken refuge in the British and American legations as hostages in order to prevent Baghdad from being bombed. When British women and children evacuated Baghdad on April 20, 500 British nationals who remained were ordered to take refuge in the British and American legations. After the outbreak of the war, the rebel Foreign Ministry sent a note to the American Minister, Mr. Knobloch, demanding that all Iraqis employed by the American legation be handed over, because the American legation might be bombed within an hour. According to the rebels, the British commander in Habbaniya had issued a despairing message, stating that if the nearby Iraqi troops did not immediately withdraw, the British would bomb the Baghdad administrative office. The Iraqi side had stated that if the British did carry out such a threat, they would retaliate by bombing the British, regardless of where they were hiding. The intention was that the Iraqi side would bomb the British and American legations where British nationals had taken refuge. In a crisis, the British nationals who took refuge in the American legation offered to leave the legation and be taken prisoner to prevent the legation from being bombed, but the American Minister preferred to risk his own life rather than allow the British nationals to leave the legation. Shortly thereafter, the rebels instructed the American Minister to hand over the British nationals so that they could be detained and treated as prisoners of war, but the Iraqi side did not prepare a suitable prisoner of war camp in advance, so the handing over of the British nationals was eventually cancelled. The British nationals slept on the floor in the legation for a month. The American Minister's hospitality was very thoughtful, and the British nationals were very grateful.

<h3 id="e41">European War Industry Talks (6) (10); Britain's Far East Arsenal; Australia's Resources and Manpower <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The courage and combat prowess of Australian soldiers have been widely praised in this European war. They have defeated Italian tanks in North Africa and consolidated defenses in Singapore, safeguarding the British Empire in the Far East and Near East. However, it is not surprising that Australia has quietly become a major arsenal, producing a large number of new-style weapons, which is truly earth-shattering. In fact, Australia's swift response and armament reorganization have been among the best in the democracies. Australia's arms production has now exceeded India's and is catching up with Canada. Proportional to its population, Australia's achievement with only seven million people should make Britain and the United States feel ashamed.</p>
<p>Six years ago, Australia was a vast continent that only produced wool, minerals, and timber. Industrial products were all imported from Britain. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company (BHP) had a monopoly on mining all kinds of mineral deposits, including coal, iron, gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, and antimony. Iron ore was mined in the Iron Knob in South Australia, other metals were mined in the Broken Hill hinterland, and coal was mined in the coastal port of Newcastle, which now has huge furnaces and iron rolling mills. Since 1938, Australia's annual steel production has increased from 1.2 million tons to 1.7 million tons (US steel production last year was only 67 million tons). There are now several arsenals rushing to manufacture Lee-Enfield rifles and bayonets, Vickers heavy machine guns, Bofors guns and gun carriages, anti-aircraft guns, smokeless powder for naval use, ammunition, shells, bombs, patrol tanks, depth charges, mines, steel helmets, and aircraft parachutes. It took the British War Office four years to manufacture the first Bofors gun. After Australia obtained the blueprints, it took less than a year to produce it.</p>
<p>As for the aircraft industry, Australia is not yet able to manufacture first-line fighter planes, but it specializes in manufacturing training planes, especially North American Wirraway training planes. An aircraft factory is currently being set up near Sydney to manufacture Bristol Beaufort bombers. Australia's first-line aircraft include more than 100 American Lockheed Hudson aircraft. Its air force training program is expected to have 57,000 air force combatants, including 14,000 pilots, by 1943.</p>
<p>Australians can be relied upon for their perseverance, efficiency, and democratic spirit, especially the Minister for Munitions, Lewis, who, like William Knudsen, Chairman of the US National Defense Advisory Commission, has the talent for mass production. Lewis was originally the manager of BHP and was later selected by the government, just as Knudsen was originally the president of General Motors and was finally discovered by Roosevelt. Since the start of the war, Australia has spent nearly one billion US dollars on war expenses, conscripted 120,000 soldiers for expeditionary forces, 250,000 soldiers for national defense, undertaken wartime savings totaling 50 million US dollars, and in a year and a half, has jumped into the ranks of industrialized countries. Australia has now mobilized all its resources for British use. Among the main products, sugar is only grown by white people in Australia. The forests of Western Australia are lush and timber is abundant. Loggers only select large trees and do not cut down the entire tree. The famous Karri trees are up to 280 feet tall and 24 feet thick. There are even more Jarrah trees, and both types of timber are very strong. There are 140 million sheep in the country, producing a large amount of wool and mutton. The wool is long and strong, and is essential for sewing military uniforms. In addition, livestock, fruit, wheat, and various minerals are inexhaustible. Therefore, the minerals in the mountainous areas of Australia and the products along the coast can be used by Britain without limit. Oil has also been discovered in the mountains behind Sydney Harbour. BHP once used this as a threat to force Royal Dutch Shell to reduce its prices.</p>
<p>Sydney is the third largest metropolis in the British Empire, second only to London and Calcutta, with a population of 1.3 million. There are 5,000 factories in the city. Newcastle to the north and Kembla to the south are famous steelmaking areas, and their development is comparable to Pittsburgh, the center of the US steel industry. The iron ore used in these two regions is transported by cargo ship from Iron Knob Island in the south.</p>
<p>The iron ore from Iron Knob is mined by BHP, and the quantity is astonishing. The surface deposits alone amount to 100 million tons, which can be mined until the year 2000 AD. There is an immeasurable amount of ore underground. The ironworks in Newcastle are very well connected. The rolling mills can accommodate the entire iron block, the open hearth furnaces can accommodate the entire molten iron, the molten iron can digest a certain amount of ore, and each furnace has an adequate amount of coking coal to provide fuel.</p>
<p>After the iron block is refined, it is further refined into steel. Australia's industry shares a similar problem with the United States, which is the lack of various basic machines for manufacturing machinery. Most of the machines currently in use are purchased from the United States, Switzerland, and even Germany. According to the Deputy Minister of Munitions, Mr. Brooker, Australia now has 30 factories rushing to manufacture this kind of machinery, and has already ordered 10 million US dollars worth of machinery from abroad. There are 36 arsenals in the country, with 20,000 workers, and they are currently carrying out three major work plans, which require a large number of additional workers.</p>
<p>Australia's industrial products are naturally inferior to those of Britain, the United States, and Germany, but it is now actively adjusting to supply the British garrison in the Far East. The steel pipes produced by BHP's steelworks, the anti-aircraft guns produced by the Melbourne factory, and the training aircraft produced by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation are of excellent quality and can be manufactured in large quantities.</p>
<p>Australia is a world of pure white people, which is very different from other continents inhabited by white people. Australians are a nation that values self-respect, is straightforward, and is pragmatic, much like the people of Texas in the United States. Australians often wear dirty work clothes and felt hats, even in the forests. People in Sydney often wear tailcoats and white bow ties, entering and leaving low-class nightclubs as if nothing happened. Many Australians also have dentures in their mouths.</p>
<p>Australians have a large consumption. Together with their neighbors in New Zealand, they can consume the same amount of flour, butter, steak, and mutton as the rest of the world. They love tea and are good at making strong tea. The tea is jet black and carefully brewed in a quart-sized iron pot in the forest. They love swimming, despite the presence of sharks on the beach. Fifty sharks are caught in a day, but they are not afraid (there are now no sharks in Sydney's beaches).</p>
<p>Women's rights are quite developed in Australia. One of the only two stone statues in the capital, Canberra, is the goddess of war, Bellona, with a skull on her head and bare breasts, fully revealing the heroic spirit of women. Since the start of the war, women have often paraded in the streets, young and old, beautiful and ugly, all participating, and some are working as paramedics. Swimming is very popular in Sydney, and it produces healthy and beautiful women.</p>
<p>Sydney has a memorial plaque for the First World War, inscribed with the words "Lest We Forget" by the great British writer Rudyard Kipling. Australia is fighting alongside Britain again, which can be said to be in the spirit of the last war. The Acting Prime Minister of Australia said it well: "If a Pacific war breaks out, Australia will fight to the end to defend its independence. No one dares to say that Australia is isolated and unable to cope with the disaster."</p>

<p>London: The British recently conducted simulated invasion exercises on the southern beaches of England. Heavy tanks, engineers, and infantry landed from flat-bottomed boats. This exercise had two purposes: one was to test coastal defenses, and the other was to practice the landing of troops and armored vehicles carried by flat-bottomed boats. The navy and air force participated. When the faint sound of engines was first heard at sea, a signal was sent out, and searchlights flashed across the sky, and artillery fire was also fired from the rear. At the same time, many flat-bottomed boats at sea were full of armed soldiers, with life preservers placed beside them. Engineers waded ashore, urgently cutting barbed wire and destroying defenses, and laying out the path for infantry and tanks to advance. Aircraft circled in the sky. The most moving scene was a team of flat-bottomed boats, neatly arranged under the searchlights, advancing side by side towards the shore. Soldiers jumped into the water and landed on the shore, some cutting barbed wire, some removing obstacles, and some attacking the searchlight teams. Everyone was doing their job, without hearing any commands, but occasionally there were whistle sounds. The lessons learned by both the attacking and defending sides were very valuable.

<h3 id="e45">Axis Ships Detained or Sunk Not Less Than Three Million Tons <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>London: The Ministry of Economic Warfare issued a statement claiming that British Coastal Command bombers have repeatedly sunk enemy ships in the North Sea and the English Channel, especially recently. Since the start of the war, until May 13, Axis ships detained or sunk totaled not less than three million tons. The Axis countries are in urgent need of ships to solve transportation problems. Britain's actions to stop Axis-controlled shipping in the Mediterranean are seen by the Axis side as making the Mediterranean war comparable to the Atlantic war. The Ministry of Economic Warfare also mentioned Vice Premier Darlan's claim that Britain illegally detained 792,000 tons of French ships, saying that Darlan admitted that Free France detained 16,000 tons, 142,000 tons could not be used in American ports due to the US President's order, and 86,000 tons were directly serving the German side and were sunk while operating on the coast. On May 20, Vichy officials admitted that a total of 250,000 tons of French ships were confiscated by Germany in the occupied areas, so only 171,000 tons of French ships can be said to have fallen into British hands, while the Vichy government has detained a total of 200,000 tons of British and Allied ships in the ports of French North Africa and other colonies. This move by Vichy was instigated by the Axis Armistice Commission, which shows that the commission has controlled French ports and transportation lines. Darlan now says that France has the right to freely dispose of its ports and transportation lines. Britain did not formally recognize the fact that the German Armistice Commission misused French independence until the Vichy independence claim was abandoned by both Germany and Vichy.

<h3 id="e48">All America Promotes "One Bowl of Rice" Movement; Giving Loyal Aid to China; San Francisco Raises US$100,000; Aiding China As Beneficial to America As Aiding England <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>San Francisco, May 10 dispatch: A grand "One Bowl of Rice" movement is underway throughout the United States, aiming to enable the American people to provide all possible assistance to the fighting Chinese people. The first report on the donations received from this movement has been announced. San Francisco also launched a "One Bowl of Rice" rally on May 2, which ended on May 5, lasting for four days. The pure income can exceed US$100,000. The final exact figure is not yet known, because the general office of the rally is still receiving donations from all parties.</p>
<p>Palace Lanterns, Dragon Gate from Hong Kong</p>
<p>The palace lanterns, dragon gate, and fireworks used in the rally were all transported from Hong Kong by the American President Lines, costing a total of US$780 in shipping fees. Because it is not allowed to transport goods without paying shipping fees, the American President Lines then donated all of the shipping fees to the "One Bowl of Rice Fund."</p>
<p>Crowded Meetings, Generous Donations</p>
<p>During the rally, the roads in San Francisco's Chinatown were temporarily renamed, such as Grant Avenue being renamed Zhongzheng Road and Stockton Street being renamed Linsen Road. The rally was originally scheduled for three days, but because the participants were extremely crowded and made generous donations to help China's struggle, it was extended for one day. At the same time, American figures urged Americans to participate in "One Bowl of Rice" rallies held in various places, generously donating and emphasizing the close relationship between aiding China and aiding England.</p>
<p>Madame Chiang Calls to America</p>
<p>Madame Chiang Kai-shek sent a telegram to appeal to the American people, stating, "The purpose of your initiation of this movement to provide relief to wartime refugees is indeed worthy. Those who wholeheartedly sympathize with us will be outraged by the poverty and suffering caused by this barbaric war. China has millions of empty rice bowls, and we are doing our best to relieve poverty, but we warmly welcome the great assistance from the world's most compassionate country."</p>
<p>Ambassador Hu Shih Elucidates Significance</p>
<p>Chinese Ambassador to the United States Hu Shih stated, "China's cause has won the heartfelt support of the American people. This is not only because China is striving to strengthen itself, but also because China's resolute resistance has become a bulwark in the Far East to protect human freedom against arbitrary destruction and enslavement by dark forces. China's cause is an indispensable part of the humanitarian cause."</p>
<p>Mrs. Roosevelt Also Attends</p>
<p>During the "One Bowl of Rice" movement in San Francisco, Mrs. Roosevelt suddenly arrived and entered the local Chinese Six Companies, purchasing "Humanitarian Corps" buttons. According to an official announcement, on May 20, the famous singer Lily Pons participated in a charity concert in New York's Carnegie Hall to support China. This was Ms. Pons' first stage appearance in New York in a year. The Chinese writer Lin Yutang will also give a speech entitled "New China." The proceeds will be handed over to the United China Relief, which is raising US$5 million to engage in relief and reconstruction work in China.</p>
<p>Counselor General Arnold Gives Eloquent Speech</p>
<p>American Commercial Counselor General Arnold issued a famous speech for the "One Bowl of Rice" rally, stating, "This move can explain to the 450 million people of China who are at war, on behalf of American men, women, old and young, that at this most tragic time in China's 4,500-year history, we sincerely extend our infinite sympathy. This sympathy arises from our deep belief in the greatest and most noble appeal in human history, that this populous and resolute ancient country has the right to occupy a recognized equal position among other countries. On the eve of the start of this year's 'One Bowl of Rice' rally, we respectfully salute the Chinese immigrants who are committed to this highly commendable common purpose, and we ask the people of the country to take this extraordinary opportunity to lend a hand and help make the 'Chinese rice bowl' full to overflowing. In this way, our great Asian neighbor will know that this rice bowl is a symbol of American goodwill, and that the United States firmly believes that a free and independent China is absolutely necessary for peace in the Pacific."</p>
<p>Pearl Buck Discusses the Essentials of Aiding China</p>
<p>The famous writer Pearl Buck also issued a statement, saying, "Strengthening the friendship between China and the United States is in our best interest, and for our own benefit, we should give China rapid and strong assistance, just like helping England. Helping China defeat Japan is tantamount to defeating Hitler in the East, and defeating him in the East in the next fifty years is far more important than defeating him in Europe. I am not only speaking for my own benefit, but also for my true love for the Chinese people. The people of China and the United States are truly friendly to each other. I admire their old culture and their modern courage. They are truly a great nation, worthy of our giving all assistance and loyal friendship. If we cooperate with them, we will definitely make the world the world we need."</p>
<p>Strengthen the Belief of the Chinese People</p>
<p>New York Governor Lehman wrote in a letter, "We must do our best to strengthen the Chinese people's belief in and hope for democratic standards, and make China the outpost of democratic countries in Asia. I hope the fundraising campaign will be a great success." The famous editor Wyatt also telegraphed, "China is a free country, and its people are fighting for national freedom. This is the century of the Chinese people. If they gain freedom, they will be able to solve their economic and industrial problems in our mechanical age. The area where the United States will receive the most reward for investing in world security is to donate to this civilian relief fund." The "One Bowl of Rice" rally held throughout the United States is hosted by the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, chaired by Colonel Roosevelt Jr. The chairman of the United China Relief is Brymmel White.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Travelers to Burma Must Have Complete Visas <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Those without Burmese government permits will have extreme difficulty landing and may be repatriated. Any Chinese travelers passing through Burma and traveling via the Yunnan-Burma highway to the rear areas of the interior should complete their visa procedures before going to Rangoon to ensure they are fully compliant. Otherwise, they may face detention and repatriation. According to a reporter from Ping Ming News Agency who spoke with people in the shipping industry yesterday, Rangoon authorities are conducting extremely strict inspections of travelers arriving from Hong Kong. If passport procedures are not completely in order (such as the passport not being signed by the bearer), there is a risk of detention, punishment, or return on the same ship. Recently, when the Hai Xing vessel arrived in Rangoon, sixteen second-class passengers, despite having visas from the British Consulate in Chongqing or the Hong Kong government on their passports, were detained because they had not obtained prior consent from the Burmese government. The Rangoon authorities deemed the procedures incomplete, and they were not allowed to disembark. Later, the Chinese Consulate-General in Burma lodged an urgent protest, and representatives from the Chinese travel industry in Rangoon went to the Water Police Bureau, the Police Station, the Ministry of Interior, and the Ministry of National Defense to explain that the lack of procedures on their passports was not the fault of the travelers. They argued that the passengers should not suffer due to the negligence of the British Consulate or the Hong Kong government. After three days of effort, they were finally allowed to land. However, the passengers had already been delayed, and their luggage was also detained and sent to customs. In the sweltering heat, they had no change of clothes, making their situation very difficult. Therefore, in the future, travelers going to Rangoon must have the Burmese government's reply or telegram permitting entry (Reference Home Dept Letter Datde) noted when applying for a visa from the British authorities to avoid unexpected incidents.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Japanese authorities announced details regarding the train derailment on the Shanghai-Nanjing line, which were reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to a report in the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, the Japanese authorities here announced today (the 2nd) that at 9:17 PM on Saturday night, a passenger train on the Shanghai-Nanjing line, heading towards Nanjing, detonated a landmine near Weiting, Suzhou. The locomotive and one carriage were completely derailed, but only two people were injured by flying glass shards. It is rumored that the landmine was detonated via electrical control. Official Japanese sources also stated that traffic on the Shanghai-Nanjing line was fully restored by 7:00 AM yesterday (the 1st). However, Chinese sources reported that several passengers died in the explosion, and it took approximately fifteen hours for the train to resume operation. Recently, guerrilla activity has increased along the Japanese-controlled railway lines. Although the Japanese army has erected electric fences on both sides of the tracks and attempted to search for guerrillas, they are still vulnerable to guerrilla attacks.</p>

<p>Socks dyeing prices increased. Yesterday was the date determined by the business side for distributing funds. Five to six hundred dismissed male and female employees gathered at the office of lawyer Wang Yaotang at 692 Weihaiwei Road around 8:00 AM. All stated that they could not accept the severance pay until the dismissal conditions were agreed upon and that the salary for the second half of May should be distributed immediately and not be lumped together. Because there was no one in charge, the mood was very tense, but order was extraordinarily good, and there were no transgressions. The delegation then sent representatives to lawyer Wang Yaotang's office on Baker Road to discuss the matter. They were received and expressed sympathy. Regarding the request for payment of salary for the second half of May, they promised to inquire with the company and provide a response promptly. This morning, they hope colleagues will still gather at Weihaiwei Road to hear the news. After the resolution of the labor dispute in the local yarn and sock dyeing industry, new measures will be implemented from the 1st of this month. The business side believes that expenses have increased and will raise dyeing prices by several percent.</p>

<p>Ningbo experienced a sudden outbreak of plague starting at the end of October last year, resulting in extremely heavy casualties. Fortunately, the Central Epidemic Prevention Team, Zhejiang Province health personnel, and the Yinxian County government hospital actively cooperated in prevention and control efforts, and the epidemic was eradicated. Unexpectedly, when the Japanese army advanced to Ningbo last month, all government agencies withdrew, causing health work to cease, and the plague resurfaced. Recently, more than a dozen people have contracted the disease one after another, and six of them have died without treatment.</p>

<p>Today is Anti-Smoking Day. The entire city's population is resolved to promote anti-smoking policies, based on the idea that a strong nation begins with a strong people, and a strong people begins with a strong body. The court is also burning confiscated narcotics. Details are noted below.</p>
<p>National Government Determined to Thoroughly Eradicate</p>
<p>The National Government authorities, recognizing that the harm caused by narcotics to the nation is greater than that of floods and ferocious beasts, established the National Anti-Smoking Committee six years ago to completely eliminate toxins and clean up the toxic atmosphere. President Chiang himself served as the director, issuing orders nationwide for a three-year ban on drugs and a five-year ban on smoking. During this period, any narcotics must be prohibited. After receiving the orders, various places acted swiftly and effectively. However, since the outbreak of war, in the occupied areas, political guidelines were lost, and the ban on smoking was abandoned. The central authorities have a very strong determination to thoroughly enforce the ban, adhering to the established policy. From now on, anyone who still transports, sells, or smokes will be severely punished according to the Anti-Smoking and Anti-Drug Punishment Regulations.</p>
<p>Citizens Consciously Eliminate Toxic Atmosphere</p>
<p>People from all walks of life, recognizing that the isolated island is in a special environment, have decided to unanimously assist the government and promote the anti-drug movement to implement the central government's anti-smoking policy. All fathers, elder brothers, teachers, superiors, and friends should strictly warn their children and subordinates to eliminate bad habits. If addicted to smoking, they must quit within a limited time. Otherwise... thoroughly eliminate the toxic atmosphere.</p>

The retail price per load (100 jin) would increase from 16 yuan to 17 yuan. These people dared to secretly decide on this price increase, which is extremely illegal. The industry association has not yet officially recognized this illegal price increase.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Chinese Air Force Will Have Surprising Performance This Year; United States Cannot Tolerate and Actively Aids China; Determined to Retaliate Against Japanese Aircraft Terror; The China Press Speculates on the Future Tasks of American Pilots Coming to China <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The China Press editorial states that, according to reliable sources from Washington, the US War Department has now permitted its Air Force personnel, including pilots and mechanics, to voluntarily resign from the Army Air Corps to serve in China. It is said that a group of aviation personnel is en route to China. Sources in Chongqing also acknowledge that authorities began preparing for the accommodation of US aviation personnel arriving in China some time ago.</p>
<p>Adopting a Retaliatory Policy in the Future</p>
<p>When American aviation personnel will target Japan is currently unknown. It is likely that their initial targets will be limited to the Japanese army on the Chinese front lines and the Japanese navy in Chinese waters. However, before the end of this year, American and Chinese aviation personnel may fly to Japan and bomb its industrial cities. This cannot be ruled out as impossible. Today's industrial manufacturing plants are considered legitimate military targets, and retaliation has become a principle of aviation warfare. The terror inflicted by the Japanese army on China in the past may one day be retaliated against.</p>
<p>The Japanese Government Asking for Trouble</p>
<p>The Japanese army and government have been asking for trouble with the United States more than once, such as violating treaties with the United States, sinking the USS Panay, insulting and mistreating Americans in the Far East and damaging their property, and entering into the Tripartite Pact with European aggressor nations. All of these are intolerable to the United States.</p>
<p>Advantage Will Disappear</p>
<p>People throughout China are delighted and excited by the news that American aviation personnel are coming to China to assist in the fight against Japan. Chongqing understands that the advantage held by the Japanese air force in Chinese airspace will disappear due to the arrival of American aviation personnel and the strengthening of the Chinese air force.</p>
<p>Governing the Country with the Three Principles of the People, Working Together in the Same Boat</p>
<p>Chongqing Minister of Military Affairs General He Yingqin has taken this opportunity to declare that China's fate is intertwined with that of Britain and the United States and has pointed out that China is a member of the ABC (initials of America, Britain, and China) alliance. He also guarantees that during the war, China's airfields and other aviation facilities will be available to the United States.</p>
<p>China's Situation Is Turning for the Better</p>
<p>General He's opinion that the United States should first resolve the Pacific issue from a military standpoint is an accurate view. He likely means the policy of choosing the weakest opponent to attack in a battle. If the US Navy resolves the issue of Japan before the end of the year, it will be a great benefit to the democratic camp and may allow the Soviet Union to join and jointly remove the threat of the Nazis. After four years of hard fighting against Japan, China is turning for the better.</p>

According to a Ping Ming News Agency reporter's investigation, the first to apply to Jardine Matheson for the second batch were Tairun and Shengxing, each allocated 500 tons of rice. The remaining fifteen grain merchants also followed suit and have now begun to allocate the supplies. Furthermore, this time, the grain merchants who are purchasing are not limited to the seventeen designated by the Shanghai Municipal Council, such as Tairun. Even those who did not initially order have also applied to purchase, including Wanshengtai, Dan--, and Taitai. According to a MacKenzie employee, the total amount ordered in the second batch will be the same as the first batch, around 10,000 tons.</p>

<p>On April 28th, thirty-three rice shops in the Concession had their rights to sell Small Sieve Rice revoked by the Municipal Council for failing to pay and collect goods on time. Last week, eight rice shops, including Taishan, were first allowed to resume sales. Yesterday, more rice shops went to Jardine Matheson to request resumption of sales, and the Municipal Council has permitted Tongan, Datung, and Dalongxing to pay and collect goods, restoring their sales rights. According to a Jardine Matheson employee, the authorities are leniently handling the punished rice shops to consider the food needs of the city and the business of the rice shops.</p>
<p>French Municipal Council Registers Saigon Rice</p>
<p>To actively stabilize the food supply, the authorities have repeatedly urged various rice industry associations to actively register rice grains in order to implement effective measures as soon as possible. The authorities have now stipulated the types of rice grains to be registered: (1) Saigon rice, regardless of grade, whether high or low, and whether it has arrived or not, must be registered with the French Municipal Council. (2) Small Sieve Rice and other imported rice must be registered with the Shanghai Municipal Council. (3) National rice is relatively small in quantity, so registration will be postponed for the time being. The authorities are now urging rice industry committee members to assist.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Rice Dumped by Ten Merchants</p>
<p>It is learned that the Municipal Council has continued to negotiate with the Hong Kong government for monthly shipments of 250,000 bags of Guangmi (Hong Kong Rice) to Shanghai. The amount to be supplied for the previous month has completely arrived, and 6,000 tons of rice for this month have also arrived. Jardine Matheson has now dumped them with ten rice merchants, including Hengfengtai, Gongda, Ruiyuan, Faxingxie, Yuanda, etc. The price per bag has been officially set by the Municipal Council at 124.70 yuan, but the rice merchants sell it to the rice shops for 123.50 yuan, and the rice shops sell it for 110 yuan per shi.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Main Suspect in Post Office Heist of Huge Sum Arrested in Japan: Robbed 2.5 Million Yuan with Thug Liang Zhengguang; All Recovered; Also Implicates Employees in Post Office Remittance Department <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, news this morning (the 2nd) states that the massive 1.5 million yuan robbery of the Postal Administration that occurred on Saturday has been solved within twenty-six hours. All of the stolen money has been recovered by the Japanese Military Police, and the two main suspects have been arrested. One is a Japanese named Masao Nomura, who previously worked for a Japanese army organ and was recently dismissed from his position a month ago. The other suspect is a thug named Liang Zhengguang, age forty.</p>
<p>Two Suspects Arrested</p>
<p>It is heard that this robbery involved internal collusion, implicating a large number of employees in the Post Office remittance department. The Japanese authorities this morning acknowledged that they had recovered the stolen money and arrested the main suspects and stated that the final investigation procedures are expected to be completed today, after which the stolen money will be returned in full to the postal authorities. It is revealed that Nomura was arrested along with Liang at his Shigaota residence just after noon yesterday (the 1st). After arresting the two suspects, the Japanese Military Police conducted a thorough search of their residence, recovering the stolen money hidden in one room.</p>
<p>Internal Collaborator</p>
<p>It is heard that after being arrested, the two suspects confessed to committing the robbery and implicated several employees in the Post Office remittance department, saying that the movement of the money was informed by people in the remittance department. Nomura and Liang colluded and conspired to commit the robbery. Liang is originally from Shandong Province and does not have a regular job. He knows employees in the Post Office remittance department, from whom he learned that the central government in Chongqing had 2.5 million yuan transported from Hong Kong to repay overdrafts from post offices in Shanghai and nearby areas.</p>
<p>Monitoring Movement</p>
<p>The money arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday afternoon on a British ship and was stored in a warehouse on the Bund in the French Concession. The two suspects monitored the movement of the money. On Saturday morning, they saw the money being transported out of the warehouse and followed the postal truck carrying the money to the Postal Headquarters at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and North Suzhou Road in a Japanese-owned rental car (license number 5152). After the car entered the headquarters, the two suspects ordered the people on the truck to transfer the money to the rental car and then sped away.</p>
<p>Swift Resolution</p>
<p>The car was later abandoned in Hongkou and discovered by the police in the International Settlement. That night, the police detained the driver of the rental car and, after questioning him, handed him over to the Japanese authorities. The Japanese Military Police obtained clues from the driver and went to Shigaota Road yesterday morning to arrest the two suspects. It is heard that in addition to confessing to the crime, the two suspects have also confessed to the person who provided information about the movement of the huge sum of money. Therefore, several other people may be arrested in succession.</p>

<p>Chemico Drug Factory, with the English name (Chemico), was originally a famous drug factory operated by Westerners. Its products, such as Calcium Mother, have long been designated by major hospitals and doctors in Shanghai. However, they were mostly popular in hospitals established by Westerners and among well-known Western doctors, so they have not been fully popularized among Chinese people. Recently, Shanghai commercial giants Sheng Pihua, Xie Shengzu, Xu Yongzuo, Xie Zhonghe, etc., have raised huge sums of money to hire four people from the original factory, including Vienna's renowned drug factory manager, pharmacist, and others, namely Ketzkegaard Hans, to continue as the manufacturing and production leaders. Therefore, all of their products are no different from imported goods. In particular, the anti-tuberculosis drug "Para Calcium Mother" is the leader among calcium supplements, and has long been famous in Shanghai, frequently used by high-class individuals. The factory's headquarters and main business office are located in the Xie Jin Building on Yuamingyuan Road, the main factory is in the Zhangjiazhai on Dunxin Road, and a branch factory is set up on Yunnan Road. In addition, they have contracted with the China-England Pharmacy as the general manager's office in Shanghai. In the future, they will also set up a general distribution office at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Guizhou Road. The chairman of the board is Mr. Sheng Pihua, the general manager is Xie Zhihui, the deputy managers are Sheng Kangnian and Li Xianying, and the business director is Ling Jingsheng.</p>

<p>The foreign exchange market situation yesterday: The HSBC listed exchange rates did not change, and the black market for British and American exchanges continued to soften. Initially, around 1:30 PM, because HSBC sold US dollars at 5.375, the exchange rate briefly rose to 5.40625, making it difficult to sell. However, as the price of gold rose, HSBC stopped selling at 11:30 AM, and the exchange rate immediately softened to 5.34375. The British exchange only settled at 3 pence, 29.6875. In the afternoon, speculators dumped June futures and posted July futures at a discount of US$0.03125, mostly swaps. Foreign banks posted bids, stabilizing the situation. The final British exchange rate was 3 pence, 29.6875, tighter by 0.015625, and the US dollar was 5.34375, tighter by 0.03125. Trading was extremely active throughout the day. Chinese merchants and speculators together shorted US dollars amounting to 700,000 yuan, and rolled over from June to short July futures amounting to 1,000,000 yuan. Because the weather is getting hotter every day, the market closed early at 3:30 PM.</p>
<p>Exchange: Early Market Stuffed</p>
<p>Since the morning, foreign telegrams reported that the silver market in India had rebounded, and there was no market in America and England. Exchange rates against Shanghai were down 0.02 for the US dollar and down 0.03125 for the British pound. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates did not change. The domestic market opened early with bank selling prices. The spot British exchange rate was 3 pence, 31.25, and the US dollar was 5.375, both returning to the closing prices of Saturday afternoon last week. Chinese merchants and speculators initially attempted to short US dollars for June at 5.40625 but failed. Soon, HSBC supplied a significant amount at 5.375. Therefore, the HSBC listed exchange rates did not change. After the white silver balancing tax was at 24.25 per cent, speculators once again stuffed the Citibank and HSBC June-July futures at 5.40625. At 9:45 AM, the exchange rate rose to the point where it was difficult to sell and settle. After 10:00 AM, Chinese merchants and speculators again covered their shorts, and after HSBC sold again at 5.375, the supply intention weakened, and the short covering intensified. The noon closing British exchange rate was 3 pence, 29.6875, and the US dollar was 5.34375.</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Also Show Good Interest</p>
<p>In the afternoon, speculators again shorted June futures at 5.34375 and stuffed July futures at 5.375. The foreign merchant banks seemed to have better interest in buying, and the situation was relatively stable. At the 4:30 PM closing, spot to June-July futures were all British exchange rate at 3 pence, 19.6875, and the US dollar at 5.34375. Compared to the noon closing prices of spot to June futures on Saturday last week, the British pound was tighter by 0.015625, and the US dollar was tighter by 0.03125. The July futures, because of the new price, had no comparison, it was said.</p>

<p>The gold market yesterday was hot, and the black market was rising. The bullish sentiment of all parties became even firmer, and the price rose close to the 6,500 yuan mark. As foreign exchange tightened amidst speculative short covering, rumors spread in the afternoon that the HSBC bank in Saigon had ceased operations, leading to some speculation about the Burma Road. Therefore, after the opening, with the selling pressure from the three gold shops, the price briefly reached 6,425 yuan. Soon, Tong Kangyong turned from short to long, aggressively buying 7,000 to 8,000 taels. Hengji, Dafeng, and Hesheng added to their purchases, and Yifeng aggressively bought as well, with the price showing a trend of large increases and small declines.

It was heard that HSBC aggressively sold US dollars at 5.375, and speculators stopped short covering and began to sell, so the price hardened slightly. Sellers emerged, with Chengji, Deda, and Shihe gold shops selling, and Xinfengyong and Defu also selling, retracting by 25 yuan, to 6,425 yuan. Tong Kangyong suddenly covered their shorts, and Hesheng also bought, raising the price to around 6,430 yuan, which remained stable for a long time. Near noon, Tong Kangyong aggressively bought to cover their shorts non-stop, and Dafeng and Hengji added to their purchases, with the rise gradually sharpening, jumping 30 yuan, reaching 6,460 yuan. Yiyuan aggressively sold only slightly, and Yida also sold, falling back to 6,448 yuan. Dafeng aggressively bought again, pushing the price up again. The noon closing was 6,457 yuan, and after the closing, 6,461 yuan. The 2:00 PM opening in the afternoon was 6,470 yuan, 13 yuan higher than the noon closing price.

<h3 id="e77">Grains: Mold Decree, Rice Prices Fall Slightly <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market situation: both futures and spot prices trended downward, and the situation was weak. The current inventory is abundant, and shipments are pouring in. The actual sales of public sale rice at flat prices by local residents are not strong. The demand from inland villages is limited, and the new stockpiles lack stimulus or attraction. Many owners, considering the hot weather, find it difficult to store for long, and are eager to sell at a price and get out early, not to mention the price of small rice has already exceeded 110 yuan. The Municipal Council is still selling at around 105 yuan, and the difference between the two is so large that it is too significant, so buyers are hesitant, and the market is difficult to stand firm, and shows a downward trend. No. 1 Saigon fell from 125.5 yuan to 122 yuan, No. 2 from 120 yuan to 118 yuan, No. 2 Siam from 116 yuan to 114 yuan, small rice from 120 yuan to 117 yuan, and Min Dang Gao from 123 yuan to 119 yuan. Crushed pointed rice was at 93.5 yuan. At this point, actual sales moved slightly, and a slight stabilization was felt, but eventually it became hovering. As a result, each price fell by 3 to 4 yuan compared to the previous week. Small rice futures and spot prices were both slightly down to 138.5 yuan per original bag, crushed rice was at 107 yuan, and futures were slightly down to 104.5 yuan. No. 1 Saigon was at 143-144 yuan. In new transactions, Dingtong sold 2,000 tons of Siam No. 2 and a half at a price of only 130 yuan. A total of 10,000 bags and over 700 tons were traded throughout the day.</p>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The French ship G.G. AVarenne, managed by the Walun Foreign Firm, directly transported over 30,500 bags of foreign rice from Saigon. The ship arrived in port on the morning of the previous day (1st) and docked at the Qichang Stack in Pudong to unload (ancestor).</p>
<p>It is heard that the inventories of thick and thin japonica rice and other domestic rice in the mainland are thin and few are arriving daily.</p>
<p>It is now the time for mold decree, and fresh goods are lacking. Only some early and late rice are arriving. Most of the thick japonica rice is old stock. Therefore, yesterday the way forward for early and late rice was uniquely prosperous, and the goods were scarce, so they were immediately sold out, and the market price suddenly increased by more than 3 yuan. Opening price was 139 yuan, 137 yuan, original bag 142 yuan, 140 yuan. Only Kunshan goods were offered at 132 yuan for thick japonica rice, a depreciation of 1-2 yuan, and the transactions were few.</p>
<p>The Dragon Boat Festival has passed for glutinous rice, and the way forward has become less frequent, but the market goods are also limited. Therefore, the market has not changed. The opening price was 114-115 yuan for Hong Kong white yuan, 107 yuan to 105 yuan for glutinous mung bean, and 100-120 yuan for domestic glutinous rice.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Flour: Local and Foreign Both Lack Initiative <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Current foreign flour transactions have deteriorated again, due to the impact of the rice price decline. The morale of all parties is difficult to rise, and the new wheat industry in the mainland has already shown its appearance, although it has not yet been listed. Speculative trading is cautious at this point. Local customers are also taking this opportunity to avoid large-scale purchases. However, Australian flour is attracting special attention from those holding goods, as the source is not continued and the inventory is thin. Yesterday, the market sold Flower and Bird brand Australian flour for 30.05 yuan, up 0.1 yuan from last week. Also, the price for bank stack bag weight is required to be 31.1 yuan. Approximately 2,000 bags were traded. Other Kenmei flour transactions held up in the morning, but could not hold up in the afternoon. Golden Dragon flour opened at 29.45 yuan, and Fort powder opened at 30.015 yuan, each slightly lower by 0.45 yuan. In the afternoon, Clock flour only opened at 30.02 yuan, slightly lower by 0.45 yuan compared to the end of last week. Approximately 10,000 bags were traded. There was no market for wheat.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Miscellaneous Grains: New Beans Difficult to Transport, Arrivals Do Not Meet Demand <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day for new green broad beans to be on the market. Only Beigang goods were available. The market price rose by 0.6 yuan, opening at 42.8 yuan. About 400 bags were distributed from Shantou, Quanzhou, Xiamen, and Mujie. Because the Hong Kong gang had no shipping space, they did not inquire yesterday. Today, the situation in the market is even worse than before, and transportation is even more difficult. Currently, it is completely dependent on bicycle transportation, so the quantity does not meet the demand. Moreover, this year's harvest is only about 60% of the usual amount, and the products are not good. The pods are thin and the beans are small, due to uneven rainfall and lack of fertilizer. Therefore, the potential future is quite tight. Other grains have all turned weak, and the bean cake downturn is even more severe. In short, actual sales are not rising. The market is all about the "rubber ball principle," so the overall situation is somewhat bearish, and the market price is falling step by step. As a result, prices were down 0.5-0.6 yuan compared to the end of the week. A total of over 30,000 pieces of various cakes were traded. On the 3rd, 400 bags of beans were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Securities: Government Bonds Trend Higher <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Government Bonds in the black market. Yesterday's market continued to be good, as the interest payment for the 11th issue was approaching, and the domestic and foreign peaceful atmosphere was intermittently appearing. People's hearts were gradually turning bullish. Most of the sellers were old bulls leaving the market, with very few new shorts. Large buyers were gradually showing strength. Although the future may not soar straight up, at least it is a curved upward trend. Yesterday morning, Defu showed special favor to Class D bonds, with slightly more demand, and the market was uniquely strong. Yu Ru Hongda Hengkang Tongshen also extensively absorbed bonds. Hengfu Yitai also strongly absorbed bonds. Tongkang and Xiekang bullishly left the market. Jiucheng Lianyi also released a lot. Retail investors slightly went short. The market price of Class D bonds suddenly broke through 6 yuan, on par with the market price of Class E bonds. Class B bonds have already broke through 9 yuan. The noon closing price of Class D bonds surged by 0.95 yuan, and the rest were also all good, up 0.25-0.6 yuan. In the afternoon, Tongshun, Hongda, and Hengkang continued to buy. Youfu also came to add to their positions, and Yuxing also collected bonds very eagerly. Lianyi turned bullish. Renfeng also covered their shorts. If it were not for the release of bonds by bullish parties like Xiekang, Dacheng, and Yizhong, Class C bonds would have broken through 8 yuan long ago, and Class B bonds would have a hope of 70 yuan. The situation was very strong. As a result, market prices were up 0.55-1.1 yuan compared to the previous week. Approximately 2.45 million yuan were traded. A brief summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 50 shares of Wuzhou Pharmacy shares were traded at a price of 110 yuan each.</p>
<p>The opening price of public utilities stocks rose slightly. There were very few changes throughout the day. Rubber stocks still showed no signs of improvement.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Yarn and Cotton: Shuangma Opens Futures Trading <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is revolving towards rising, because the bullish sentiment of the bulls is still firm, so the market is stable. However, spot yarn transactions are not as enthusiastic as before the festival. However, a portion of the market, with Shuangma factory orders, is still not very loose. It may be useful to adopt a bullish strategy when the price falls. Therefore, the market is soft with a hard undertone. It is rumored that Shuangma futures have opened, with the July opening price at 1,380 yuan and the closing price at 1,382 yuan. The August opening price was 1,387 yuan and the closing price was 1,392 yuan. This is calculated based on the spot price of foreign firms, which is nearly 50 yuan different from the price of Shuangma factory orders. Approximately 4,000-5,000 bags were traded. The high price of 20-count Shuangma spot yarn was 1,437 yuan, and the low price was 1,440 yuan. The initial price in the afternoon was 1,438 yuan. It was then heard that the price of gold was good, rising to 1,450 yuan. The final price was 1,448-1,449 yuan. Today, 43 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong and 50 pieces were shipped to Siam. Currently, the yarn market is complex, and future changes are so diverse that people are lost in a fog and do not know where to start.</p>
<p>Shuangma opened in the morning, and the trend was very weak. The public wanted to sell because there was talk that the exchange would open in the near future. The opening price was 1,430 yuan, and scalpers were unanimously selling. It was rumored that the price of the exchange was 1,160 yuan, so the situation was soft, falling to 1,420 yuan. Between these 22-24 yuan, the price fluctuated for a long time. At the same time, trading was not strong. Until around 12:00 PM, it was said that margin increased, and foreign exchange was expected to soften, and buying became strong, and the market turned forward. The closing price was 1,437 yuan. The trading volume during the day was 8,260 bales, of which 260 bales were by Hong Kong merchants and 8,000 bales were by domestic merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Current Cotton Mill Stomach Blocked <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The current cotton shape is still stable. The trend of fine velvet cotton is quite strong, but the factory's stomach has no strong ability to absorb. The number of transactions is not large, and only 100 pieces of Middling cotton were traded at the stack delivery price of 438 yuan, which was a deal between numbers.</p>
<p>In other news, foreign firms in Shanghai rarely purchase foreign cotton, and only transfer and sell it to North China to decorate. However, the foreign cotton market has remained firm, and at the same time, due to the lack of water legs, it is quite inconvenient to transport to Shanghai. The cotton market is firm and stable and is not weakening due to the roundabout yarn market and the temporary wait-and-see attitude of all parties.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market fell due to sales by Southern gangs and long liquidation. Yesterday's closing price was approximately 3-4 pounds lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market is narrow and transactions are weak. The closing price rose slightly by 1-2 rupees. It is predicted that today's opening market will be slightly bullish.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Piece Goods: Market Sales Still Dim <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The cloth market revolved yesterday, because the market price was gradually rising, and the market turned around, but the current sales were dim, and the rising power was still weak. The opening prices of all cloth sales were little changed in the morning. In the afternoon, there was a slight increase. As a result, white goods, fine cloth and twill rose by 0.25-0.5 yuan, coarse cloth rose by 0.25 yuan, and bleached and dyed cloth was flat. Local street transactions were over 200 pieces of various cloths. The demand from the Nanyang Gang of customers was still good, selling 200-300 pieces of coarse cloth and bleached and dyed cloth, etc. The Cantonese and Hong Kong gangs sold nearly 100 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill, etc.</p>
<p>Dongbu cloth fell in the morning and recovered in the afternoon, and the trend turned firm. The low price of Longtou fine cloth spot delivery was 43.5-43.6 yuan in the morning. Subsequently, due to the rising yarn market, short covering was made, and the pull in the later market was even tighter, rising step by step to 45.4 yuan. The Four Gentlemen serge rose to 1.435 yuan. However, according to the actual situation, customer sales have not yet been launched.</p>
<p>Exports: On the 3rd, 115 pieces of piece goods were exported to Hong Kong, 265 pieces were exported to Siam, and 150 pieces were exported to Yantai.</p>

Yesterday, Zhanghua and Yihua brand cloths were sold for 19.5 yuan per yard, Hongsheng single-width cloth was 11.25 yuan, Xie Xin was 25 yuan, Li Xing and Meifa were 26 yuan, Donghuo white serge with double yellow edges was 28 yuan, Yongyu No. 400 was 28.5 yuan, Baofeng riding breeches was 51.5 yuan, and Meifeng plain overcoat was 65 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Peanuts (2) <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Jianong</p>
<p>Speaking of how the Portuguese propagated peanuts to Africa, one cannot help but think of a tragic scene that horrified the world, and was also a major stain on human history! The reason they spread peanuts to Africa was not out of goodwill for the black Africans, but rather an accidental result of the "slave trade," a terrifying event filled with countless painful separations and deaths! It was the Portuguese slave traders who intended to use this "longevity" fruit, as they called it, as food for the African black slaves they called "ebony"! Therefore, the reason why the black Africans can now enjoy these exquisite peanuts is really at the cost of the shackles and chains suffered by tens of thousands of "ebony," the whippings and beatings, and the drops of sweat and fresh blood that flowed! Alas, humanity!</p>
<p>How did peanuts spread to China? Who first imported them? I have scoured Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica and Xu Guangqi's Complete Treatise on Agriculture, but I could not find even a single word of record. Then, its arrival in China was certainly later than sweet potatoes and corn. To investigate the truly earliest record of peanuts, it is probably no more than Fang Yizhi's Miscellaneous Records of Physics. In the Dou Fan Bean entry under the Dietary section of this book, it says: "Fan bean, also known as peanut, also known as earth bean. Plant it in February or March, no more than a few seeds in a ridge... Flowers bloom on the vine, and the filaments fall into the soil to form fruit. Dig it out of the soil after winter. The shell has patterns, and the beans are yellowish-white. When stir-fried, it tastes sweet and fragrant like pine nuts..." Fang Yizhi was from Tongcheng. He passed the imperial examination during the Chongzhen reign and was one of the Four Gentlemen of the late Ming Dynasty. After the Ming Dynasty fell in 1644, he cut his hair to become a monk. Therefore, the evidence that is difficult to refute is that peanuts were introduced to China during the transition from the Ming to the Qing Dynasty in the 17th century. According to the records of the Fuqing County Annals of Fujian Province: "Peanuts originally came from foreign countries. In the early years of the Kangxi reign, a monk named Yingyuan went to Fusang (Japan) to find seeds and sent them back..." Hai Bian驳驳驳驳 said: "The Japanese call peanuts Nanjing beans, so it can be seen that the Japanese peanut seeds came from China. The statement in the Fuqing County Annals does not seem credible." I think that even if this matter is credible, it can only be compared to the example of Lin Huaizhen introducing sweet potatoes, and it should be regarded as reaching the same destination by different routes. The ironclad case of Miscellaneous Records of Physics cannot be shaken. As for Wu Qijun's Illustrated Compendium of Plants, quoting Tan Cui's Records of the Yunnan Sea Balance: "Peanuts are the first among the fruits of the South, and their use for the people is the most widespread. During the Song and Yuan dynasties, along with cotton and sweet potatoes, Cantonese merchants obtained them from various countries at sea and planted them in Gui: They called cotton kapok, sweet potatoes yams, and peanuts earth beans, and Yunnan called them peanut pines." As soon as we look at it, we know that it has committed a chronological error and is a presumptuous statement: because the New World had not yet been discovered during the Song and Yuan dynasties, where would the sweet potatoes and peanuts come from? The Illustrated Compendium of Plants also cites: "Nancheng County Annals: commonly called Fan bean, also called land fruit. Ganzhou Annals: peanut, also known as the 'longevity fruit'..." There is also the "Notes of Southern Yue: peanuts... Flowers spit silk, but cannot form pods. The pods are born separately between the roots and stems. Dig it out of the sand. The shell is about an inch long and has wrinkles, with three or four fruits inside, similar to broad beans. The taste is sweet and refreshing, with a slight ginseng smell, also known as flower ginseng..." All of this is excellent historical material. - Now, to sum it all up: Peanuts were introduced to China in the 17th century by the people of Fujian and Guangdong from overseas (the Philippine Islands?), and were first planted in the south, and then spread to the north.</p>
<p>There are Brazilian and Peruvian varieties of peanuts, as mentioned earlier. The Brazilian variety has large grains, while the Peruvian variety has small grains. The first variety to be introduced to China was the small-grained Peruvian variety, which is what ordinary people now call "small peanuts." The large-grained Brazilian variety - which ordinary people simply call peanuts, to contrast with the previous variety, only adding the word "large" - was only transplanted to our country in recent years, and it has a great tendency to completely take the place of the previous variety. I remember a few years ago, an older farmer told me: "Small peanuts are native to China" - of course, he did not know that they were first brought over from overseas - "large peanuts are newly arrived from foreign countries..." Chu Yiran also said in his book on the cultivation of oil crops: "... Later, an American collector introduced the American large-grain variety to Shandong and other areas, and due to its excellent quality and abundant yield, it was eagerly planted. Indeed, more than ten years ago, the peanut market in the north was still a mixture of Peruvian and Brazilian varieties, with equal power. Now, the market is filled only with mountains of large peanuts. Even if small peanuts have not disappeared, they are rare and few. However, in terms of quality, Chu Yiran's words are incorrect. The small peanuts far exceed the large peanuts: small peanuts not only have a particularly exquisite flavor, but also have an oil yield of up to 50%, while large peanuts only have an oil yield of 40%. The reason why large peanuts have the upper hand is only because of their "abundant yield." (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e86">Sugar Market: Abundant Raw Sugar Accumulation, a Precipitous Decline <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of forward sugar trading by the Exchange, it has attracted the attention of speculators and hoarders, who have tried their best to absorb the supply. The price of No. 24 raw sugar, for example, rose from 82 yuan to 120 yuan, creating an unprecedented surge. However, informed individuals within the industry have repeatedly warned against this, hoping to moderate the price increase, but to no avail. Based on production costs, the price has been inflated by a significant 20 yuan. Moreover, incoming shipments continue unabated, while actual sales are sluggish, leading to a situation of unmanageable inventory accumulation. Confidence has waned, and selling pressure is strong, resulting in a precipitous price decline. Yesterday, spot prices for No. 2 raw sugar for January arrival were 91.3 yuan, new cargo for April arrival was 94.2 yuan, and for June 10 delivery, the morning opening price was 96.3 yuan, closing at 94.2 yuan. The afternoon opening was 94.2 yuan, closing at 94.8 yuan. For June 20 delivery, the morning price was 98 yuan, closing at 93 yuan, and the afternoon opening was 95.4 yuan, closing at 95.6 yuan. TaiKoo B Mark Puxi stored goods were priced at 103 yuan, with little interest in other brands. There were 6,300 bags of sugar arriving from Hong Kong on the second day.</p>

<p>The coal briquette market had been quiet for a long time. Earlier this month, due to demand exceeding supply, underground trading of warehouse receipts pushed prices as high as 330 yuan. However, as factories maximized supply, the underground market softened by the end of the month, but the factory price remained unchanged at 296 yuan. Unexpectedly, the price reversed course the day before yesterday (the 1st), and the factories claimed that coal dust and water costs had increased significantly, leading to an increase of 20 yuan in the wholesale price among traders. Warehouse receipts for coal briquettes are now 316 yuan per ton, and the retail price at stores is set at 17 yuan per load. However, some stores with existing inventory in this street offer prices that are 4 or 5 cents cheaper. As for the low-priced coal briquettes advertised through broadcasting, they are produced by small factories not affiliated with the association and are not subject to these restrictions.</p>

<p>The price of American narrow strip steel has risen by more than 10 yuan in the past few days due to the interruption of supplies from Hong Kong and the limited inventory in Shanghai. Yesterday, the asking price was 335 yuan per 200-pound box (for mixed colors). Selected colors are even scarcer, making it impossible to pick and choose. Trading activity is slow, with only mixed-quality goods being traded in the market. It is reported that canneries, toy factories, printing plants, cigarette tin manufacturers, and hoarders trading among themselves are dealing in quantities of 300 to 500 boxes, boosting market sentiment somewhat.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Shanghai Summer School Enrollment <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>During the summer vacation, many major middle schools and universities run summer schools, but they are all designed for current students. A summer school to prepare high school graduates for university entrance exams is rare. In view of this, alumni of various universities have prepared the Shanghai Summer School and established a college preparatory class to provide systematic review for those taking university entrance exams and guide them in the ways of taking the exams. It is reported that the school is now ready and has invited famous university professors and middle school principals as consultants. It has also gathered more than 80 professors, assistant teachers, recent graduates, and senior students from 16 schools including Shanghai Medical College, Jiaotong, Datong, Tongji, Tongde, Guanghua, Soochow, Ginling, Concord, St. John's, Lester, Jinan, Hujiang, Aurora, Yenching, and others to serve in the school. All of them are young and excellent and happy to associate with younger students, using friendship to increase interest in learning. This is the school's characteristic. The school address is temporarily borrowed from the Jinye Vocational School on Wangjia Sha East, Baker Road. The location is central and the school buildings are spacious. Enrollment has now begun.</p>

<p>(8) Reproduction Methods</p>
<p>A. The structure and function of animal male and female reproductive organs.</p>
<p>B. Asexual reproduction includes fission and budding. Sexual reproduction includes bisexual and unisexual reproduction, and the phenomenon of alternating generations.</p>
<p>(9) Adaptation</p>
<p>The form and nature of animals often change due to the influence of the environment in order to adapt to the external environment and maintain survival forever. The most obvious examples are protective coloration, warning coloration, mimicry, symbiosis, and parasitism.</p>
<p>(10) Heredity and Variation</p>
<p>The transmission of parental traits of animals, where the traits are similar to each other, is called heredity. However, there are cases where, during the formation of sperm and egg cells in germ cells, special things happen, resulting in special sperm and eggs, or the fertilized egg is affected by external things after combination, resulting in variation.</p>
<p>(11) Animal Evolution</p>
<p>In 1859, Darwin published "On the Origin of Species," explaining with facts that all animals evolved gradually from a common ancestor. The current complex species evolved and separated from simple species. Now, animal evolution is further proven in terms of anatomy, development, fossils, distribution, and biochemistry.</p>
<p>(12) The Position of Humans in the Animal Kingdom</p>
<p>Humans and anthropoid apes have many similarities and belong to the phylum Chordata, class Mammalia, order Primates, suborder Haplorhini. Therefore, humans and anthropoid apes come from the same source, but they have evolved in different ways. One branch is humans, and the other branch is anthropoid apes.</p>
<p>(13) The Relationship between Animals and Plants</p>
<p>A. Spreading pollen to help plants with fertilization.</p>
<p>B. Excreting carbon dioxide for plants to use in photosynthesis.</p>
<p>C. Excreting urine and feces as fertilizer for plants.</p>
<p>D. Directly and indirectly harmful to plants.</p>
<p>C. Research Examples</p>
<p>A. Observation and Research</p>
<p>Studying zoology is not limited to schools and classrooms. The natural environment can be studied and observed anytime and anywhere. Taking Shanghai as an example, Zhaofeng Park, French Park, the Great World, the zoo of the circus, as well as Wuhang and insect stalls are all good places for investigation and research. From these places, one can acquire practical knowledge of the morphology, physiological functions, and living conditions of many animals. If there are opportunities for visits and travel, that is even more of an opportunity to find new materials.</p>

<p>— Xiao Yun</p>
<p>When automobiles first appeared on the roads in America, the horses pulling carts were greatly frightened. Many of them stopped in the middle of the road and refused to move a step. Later, after getting used to these "monsters," they became indifferent, but they have already been eliminated by the "monsters."</p>
<p>Recently, the owner of a chicken farm in Monrovia, California, USA, is negotiating with local authorities to apply for a ban on airplanes near the chicken farm. Because many hens, seeing these "monsters," refuse to squat down to lay eggs and just stand all day.</p>
<p>Humans are sometimes like this. Our conservative character makes us unaccustomed to new things and makes us oppose new ideas. However, the progress of the times is not lenient. It does not stagnate because of our conservatism. On the contrary, it will leap forward regardless of everything. Our only option is not to bury our heads in the sand or turn a blind eye, nor is it to protest or oppose, but to open our eyes, recognize new things, new ideas, new times, and follow it to progress. Other actions are futile. People should be a little smarter than horses and chickens.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Air Force Carrier Pigeons <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Revision and Supplement</p>
<p>Believe it or not, when British Air Force planes fly to Germany or German-occupied areas to bomb, they not only carry deadly bombs, but also carry pigeons symbolizing peace. Those pigeons are military carrier pigeons, which can make up for the shortcomings of new-style military supplies and have actually saved many lives. Originally, the Air Force soldiers relied on the wireless radio on the plane to communicate with the headquarters of the home country, but once the wireless radio failed—this kind of thing is very common under the artillery fire of the enemy—wouldn't they be at a loss? Sometimes they drift at sea, sometimes they are trapped on a desert island, so they have to use those carrier pigeons. Sensitive carrier pigeons will fly back to England and convey the news of the unfortunate soldiers to the headquarters. Military agencies that defend the country, sometimes because the air raids are fierce, cannot use the usual communication tools, so they also release carrier pigeons to transmit military messages.</p>
<p>The London government has regarded the pigeons of peace as "defenders of the country." All 100,000 pigeons in the national pigeon farm have long been ordered to serve the country. All pigeon vendors in the country are stocking "reserve soldiers" of more than one million, all of whom have registered with the government and are willing to have all their carrier pigeons dispatched by the government. The government also installed telephones for them at their own expense so that they could immediately report emergency messages brought back from the front line to the government.</p>
<p>In the past, the British government did not allow people to shoot and capture old eagles, but now, regardless of old eagles or young eagles, they are all killed without question. The government also advises people not to be greedy for pleasure and kill pigeons to fill their stomachs. The official said in a formal document: "At present, meat is subject to control, and the value of pigeons is only about one shilling, but the messages transmitted by this kind of poultry are related to the lives of the air force soldiers of our country!" Gluttons who ignore this document shall be fined 100 yuan or imprisoned for three months, which shows how much the government values pigeons.</p>
<p>The National Pigeon Farm trains a large number of carrier pigeons so that they can fly 600 miles across the sea and land. Recently, a carrier pigeon actually flew from Xiznei to New York, a distance of 3,000 miles, taking 15 months. In short-distance "voyages," carrier pigeons can maintain a speed of one mile per minute with the help of the wind. However, in long-distance flights, the average speed is 35 to 40 miles per hour. Pigeon vendors sometimes use ingenious methods to train carrier pigeons. Incubating female pigeons, due to the instinct of maternal love, hurriedly fly back to the original place. Two weeks after the young pigeons hatch, male pigeons miss their homes and will desperately fly back. Heterosexual pigeons miss each other very much after being separated for a few days, so they are eager to reunite. These are the reasons why carrier pigeons increase their speed on the return journey.</p>
<p>When each carrier pigeon "serves in active duty," its feet are tied with metal tubes. There is a blank space on the surface of the tube for writing urgent documents. Longer documents that can be written calmly can be hidden inside the tube.</p>
<p>It is not an easy task for pilots to release pigeons in flight, because the wind force at high altitudes often reaches more than 300 miles per hour. If the pilot releases them carelessly, the weak life cannot withstand the strong wind. The safest way is to wrap the pigeon in newspaper and fold its wings tightly on both sides. After the newspaper breaks open in the air, they can flap their wings and fly away.</p>
<p>How do carrier pigeons have the ability to transmit messages? There is still no satisfactory answer to this question. Some people say that this is entirely instinct, because they are timid, do not like loneliness, and are willing to reunite with their parents and children. Sunlight and smell do not affect them. A more credible theory is that the magnetic force of the ground allows them to recognize the way home. When radio stations broadcast, pigeons cannot identify directions around it, and when there is lightning in the air, pigeons cannot tell east from west.</p>

<p>(8) Palpable Friendship</p>
<p>"I know this, but has Seventh Master been released yet?" Zhao Si told him not to be impatient, but today Yu Kun was particularly impatient.</p>
<p>"Originally, everyone said that with his money and power, at most one court session would be enough; who knew that three days ago, the verdict came down, and that bastard dog official actually sentenced him to sixteen months; isn't that infuriating? The strangest thing is that Third Master is his uncle and currently a famous military leader, yet he doesn't think of a way to bail him out!" Yu Kun said, finally understanding. "Very good!" When people reach a point of helplessness, they often say things that even they themselves can't explain.</p>
<p>Zhao Si suddenly stood up and handed Yu Kun two sheets of paper filled with writing that had been pressed under an inkstone.</p>
<p>"These past few days, I've been carefully taking stock at home. Aside from debts owed to or by others that I'm not very clear about, everything else, whether valuable or not, I've listed it all!" He said as he walked back and forth in the room. "You can double-check it in a little while."</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Yu Kun didn't even look and stuffed the two sheets of paper into his pocket.</p>
<p>"No hurry, that's a minor matter. It's best if we go visit Seventh Master first. Third Master still has a few words he wants me to relay to him." Before he finished speaking, he had already stood up from his seat. "Fourth Master, would you please accompany me on a trip now?"</p>
<p>"Why not!" Zhao Si replied without hesitation, but when he looked at the sunlight outside the window, he couldn't help but frown immediately, because fat people are all afraid of the heat.</p>
<p>Yu Kun was only thinking about seeing Yuan Shaowen and didn't care whether he was afraid of the heat or not. He immediately urged him to put on a long gown, instructed the two elderly servants left at home, and hurried out the door with him.</p>
<p>"Which way is it?" Once at the gate, as he was about to call for a car, Yu Kun realized he should ask first. (122)</p>

<h3 id="e107">Wireless Telegraph Paper <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Zhong</p>
<p>The United States in New York recently conducted an experiment with wireless telegraph paper, and it is expected that it may soon become a reality. The method is the same as wireless broadcasting. The only difference is one is broadcasting sound, and the other is broadcasting paper (i.e., text and photos). In the future, anyone who has a "wireless receiver" at home can pull out a newspaper from the machine every morning, the content of which is exactly the same as what is issued by the "wireless telegraph office." This is truly a miracle of the scientific world, seeking the advancement of the human lifestyle. It's not for personal report cards and degrees, but to seek social transformation and happiness.</p>
<p>A true college student should have a beautiful soul, and not just a beautiful appearance. But that doesn't mean that an unattractive appearance necessarily has a beautiful soul; nor does it necessarily mean that someone with a beautiful appearance has an ugly soul. Only those who forget themselves, sincerely love others, help others, and study and use knowledge for justice, for the happiness and enlightenment of humanity, and strive tirelessly, have a truly beautiful soul.</p>
<p>Because a segment of female students need beautiful souls, therefore I said these words to summon their souls:</p>
<p>Soul, return! Heaven endowed you with your essence, why do you need flamboyant makeup? People can be deceived, but Heaven cannot be deceived!</p>
<p>Soul, return, empty words cannot be entrusted, facts speak louder than eloquence, don't say one thing and do another.</p>
<p>Soul, return, superficial writing cannot be entrusted, "to believe everything written in books is worse than having no books at all."</p>
<p>Return, return! The magnificent landscape is certainly not found in dead medical books, but in a lively mind that integrates knowledge.</p>
<p>Return, return! The myriad living beings are not found on lips or nails painted with rouge, but in hard work and seeking truth from facts. Soul, return!</p>
<p>(Editor's note: Mr. Cang Su's writing this article to summon the souls of some female university students in Shanghai is certainly a great virtue. However, summoning only the souls of female students without summoning the souls of some male students is somewhat biased in favor of women and against men, so we have added a sentence: "Souls of male university students, please also return together!")</p>

<p>— Cang Su</p>
<p>Reading Ms. Ying's "I Don't Seem Like a College Student" on May 10th gave me a very deep impression, not only because it reflects a corrupt aspect of isolated education, but also because it expresses our questions about the words "college student."</p>
<p>What kind of "college student" does Ms. Ying describe in her small portrait? It's those who wear heavy makeup, lipstick, and nail polish, who only know how to decorate themselves and enjoy themselves all day long, who don't study, but who are just some people flaunting the "college student" brand. Can these people represent "college students"? Of course not.</p>
<p>I believe that a college student should at least be: not only learning a specialized skill and academic knowledge, but also cultivating a noble personality suitable for community life, having a correct understanding of culture, collectively researching and working, pursuing the spirit of truth from facts, having sincere and unhypocritical, practical and unexaggerated words and deeds, not memorizing formulas and notes, but applying scientific methods.</p>

<p>— Zhou Ziyu</p>
<p>After the famous actor Zhou Xinfang reported that he would be taking a break from performing on May 6th for health reasons, the Haixing Society reported, "Mr. Zhou's rest period may be extended, and even now, the date of his return to the stage cannot be determined, as it is not simply a health issue." Now that Yan Jupeng's performance period has ended, and after the transition between the "China Travel" and film companies, Mr. Zhou will continue to rest. The performers will be the Pingjiao Xu Dongming and Xu Dongxia sisters. Furthermore, the theater may follow in the footsteps of Huang Jinrong and exclusively invite Pingjiao performers. As for Huang Jinrong's invitation to Zhang Eyun, it has not been discussed recently.</p>
<p>I have learned that after Yan Jupeng stopped performing, the Carlton Grand Theater will also invite famous Peking Opera actors from Beiping. The first group of new actors invited are the Xu Dongming and Xu Dongxia sisters. Dongming studies the laosheng (old male) role and is a protégé of the late veteran actor Cai Yuting (Cai was Ma Lianliang's teacher). Dongxia is a qingyi and huadan (female) role, her art taught by famous teachers and once a student of Xun Huisheng. Her appearance is extremely beautiful, and her voice is a gift from heaven, a rising star among female actors. The wusheng (male military) role is Wang Zhongchen, the xiaosheng (young male) role is Zhou Weijun, the chou (clown) role is Guan Shengji, and the hualian (painted face) role will be borrowed from Huang Jinrong: Qiu Shengrong. They have already departed from Beiping to the south and are expected to appear on stage in about ten days. In addition to Zhou Xinfang and Wang Xichun, the other members of the original Yifeng Society at the Carlton Theater will continue to perform as usual.</p>
<p>Passing by Mr. Zhou Xinfang's residence by chance, I couldn't help but think of the contemporary red actor who hadn't performed in a long time. Eager to know a little about Mr. Zhou's recent situation, I was happy to make a personal visit out of friendship.</p>
<p>After gently knocking on the gate twice, a male servant opened the door and asked us our business. After Mr. Xue Weihan handed him a card, Mr. Zhou came to the gate himself not long after, expressing a warm welcome.</p>
<p>After a pleasant handshake, Mr. Zhou politely led us to sit down in an elegantly furnished living room. After exchanging greetings, our conversation officially began.</p>
<p>Mr. Xue: "Mr. Zhou, I heard that your recent rest is related to your health. Is that correct?"</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou: "Indeed, it's because I haven't recovered from the sequelae of a lung ailment. My body is quite weak. The doctor said that it's not suitable to perform continuously and that I must rest for a while. It just so happened that Mr. Yan Jupeng came south, so I'm taking this opportunity to recuperate."</p>
<p>Mr. Xue: "In that case, Mr. Zhou will return to the stage after Mr. Yan returns north?"</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou: "No, I need a longer period of rest. After Mr. Yan returns north, I may have to ask someone else to take my place on stage."</p>
<p>Mr. Xue: "Then when will Mr. Zhou be able to return to the stage?" Mr. Zhou: "I'm afraid... I need at least one or two months of rest. If possible, maybe I'll postpone my return to the stage until autumn."</p>
<p>Mr. Xue: "Will Mr. Zhou decline all outside social engagements during your break?"</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou: "Yes, there are many outside social engagements. Some invite me to dine, and others ask me to perform in charity shows. Although I really want to participate, it's difficult to fulfill my wishes in reality."</p>
<p>This Writer: "Does Miss Wang Xichun also need a long-term break?"</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou: "Of course, she also needs a long-term break to avoid the effects of too much work on her health."</p>
<p>This Writer: "Although Mr. Zhou's health is not good, you seem to be in good spirits."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou: "That's because we had a good chat, and I'm excited!"</p>
<p>Mr. Xue: "Mr. Zhou has spent a long time with us, and I'm afraid you're very tired. We would like to take our leave now."</p>
<p>At this point, we bid farewell to Mr. Zhou, and he politely escorted us out the door.</p>

One is that the dashing young man Robert Taylor is about to divorce his wife, Barbara Stanwyck, both of whom are famous movie stars. The other is that the shy star Gary Cooper and his wife have also had a falling out and are said to be about to divorce as well. However, people hope that both of these news stories are fictional. In Hollywood, marriage and divorce are fickle matters, but the breakup of these two celebrity couples is somewhat unpleasant.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Ten The First Glimpse of Gongsun's Swordplay</p>
<p>Sang Yiqing was crying with a gloomy face, not saying a word. Wang Yongtai then said to Xu Jing, "Now I understand everything. This enchanting woman is inherently licentious and cannot stay still. I shouldn't have married her. And this thief named Sang, I shouldn't have allowed him to stay in my house, letting them do such beastly things. Won't people secretly call me a senile fool? I am also very sorry for my virtuous nephew. I mistakenly believed the words of a despicable woman and regarded a good person as a bad person. Luckily, my virtuous nephew came here and caught this pair of dogs, man and woman, for me. I will never spare them. How do you think I should deal with them?" Xu Jing laughed coldly, saying, "There's no point in keeping them alive. Uncle, do whatever you want. I only ask that the injustice I suffered last time be cleared up." Wang Yongtai said, "Okay, I will definitely not let these two live in the world and be disgraced. Since they are so fond of each other, let them go to the underworld to live together. For now, let them live a little longer and deal with them slowly. But there's one more thing I want to ask my virtuous nephew: although you came here very quickly to catch this pair of dogs, man and woman, for me, I don't know if you have lost anything valuable?" Wang Yongtai's words reminded Xu Jing, and he remembered the precious sword on his back, and his heart couldn't help but jump. His Crimson Phoenix Sword was stolen; how would Wang Yongtai know about this? Strange, strange! Could it be that he is deliberately playing games with me? But that's not necessarily the case; first, he would never have known that I was coming here and tease me; second, he only found out about the affair between He Ji and Sang Yiqing tonight, otherwise, why didn't he go straight to his own building and deal with the adulterer and adulteress? Xu Jing stared blankly, thinking, unable to guess the reason. Wang Yongtai couldn't help but say to him again, "Has your virtuous nephew's Crimson Phoenix Sword been stolen?" Xu Jing could only say at this time, "Yes, this matter is strange. The Crimson Phoenix Sword on my back was suddenly stolen, and I couldn't catch up. I'm very ashamed. But how did Uncle know beforehand? I am confused and don't understand the truth. Uncle knows, please tell me. Also, what I can't understand is that since you didn't know about the adultery, and tonight is the night you keep the precept, how would you come upstairs yourself at this time? I don't think it's a coincidence, right? Please show me, Uncle." (79)</p>

<p>The result of the commodification of labor is that the less work the better, the higher the price the better, and the collective and the individual become opposed. If this continues to the extreme, the collective is finished, and the individual is also finished. Therefore, the commodification of labor should be opposed.</p>

<p>Actors Liu Qiong, Mei Xi, and director Yue Feng, among others, of the Guolian Company have organized the Guolian Basketball Team and often practice in the sports field specially built by the Guolian authorities. Their performance is very good. The Tiemat Basketball Team (jointly formed by members of the Guohua Company and staff of the Family Industry Society) recently competed with Guolian. Both sides deployed their most elite units. As a result, Guolian won by a score of sixty-nine to thirty-three.</p>
<p>Wu Yonggang's work after "Tears of Blood in the Iron Window" has been decided to be "Dragon Versus Tiger," which is also aimed at satirizing the current society. The entire theme is very serious. Liu Qiong and Wang Yin, who are good at hard-line style, have been specially invited to co-star.</p>
<p>The Huasheng Troupe's public performance of "Yue Fei" will not be abandoned because Wu Yonggang, Liu Qiong, Chen Qi, etc., refuse to direct or perform. Su Shi has been specially invited to direct, Huang He to play Yue Fei, and Wang Xianzai to play Qin Hui, and Sun Jinglu to play Yinping. Others including Zhou Chu and Qiao Qi are also participating in the collaboration. Rehearsals have been held in the Meicheng Photography Factory for several days.</p>
