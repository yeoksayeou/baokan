<p>海軍總司令金歐納斯特上將、生於渥海渥洲、會任航空母艦艦長、對於潛艇戰爭及空軍各項問題、均有特殊研究、今後戰事旣以海空軍聯合作戰為基幹一、由金上將出任海軍總司令、自屬極端重要、</p>
<p>海軍參謀長史達克上將之主一要任務、端在使政府當局與海一軍部取得密切聯絡、易言之、即一在人民與海軍之間、担任聯絡一工作、直接對美國總統負責、其一唯一的長官、厥乃美國總統、惟一史上將旣非正式指揮艦隊之海一軍上將、亦非在陸上服務之海軍將官、但依照海軍傳統、渠必一須常川航海、以便參預戎機、此外、上將　為美國第一流之行一政專家、且富有組織能力、　亞洲艦隊總司令赫德上將、雖已屆退休年齡、但仍担任總司令一職、推原其故、殆因渠擅長潛水艇作戰有以致之、</p>
<p>陸軍參謀長馬歐爾將軍、係浮琴尼亞軍官學校畢業、並未入西點陸軍大學肄業、此與美國一般陸軍將官不同、馬氏甘參加上次世界大戰、法國聖米歇爾一役、渠亦躬預其事、曾獲有光榮戰績、</p>

<p>— 寥霂</p>
<p>當此之時，個人要獲得些生活資料，來維持生存，奔走喘息，左支右細，實在苦不勝言；但苦呢，總比不能生存來得好得多，此所以連得一個三尺之童，在平　行列裏，也會咬緊牙關，不敢脫離他底陣綫。</p>
<p>但有些胖頭肥耳之流也未司一槪而論，他們生來似乎就無煩惱，如執而與之歎苦景，終不免隔膜得很。他們面色旣然逈異，頭腦也竟不同。——然而他們眞個玩世不恭，却父未必；除在伏在汽車上頭髮給拉成非雄賓香蕉的紈椅子弟不大懂人情之外，大多數笑嘻嘻面團團的人就更能體會世故，而且更曉得世情的險惡這回事。——他們目己就是這樣竄上的。</p>
<p>然而有些得意的人物，却因之最能「玩世」。譬如舉一個例：他們每會作自我宣傳，——自我宜傳而最輕而易舉的就是一發帖子」，不論紅白，他總懂得禮節。一則表示身份闊綽，二則等而下之不免打打秋風。忽然靈機一動，便印上幾千個帖子：「先嚴九十冥慶，「小兒彌月之喜」，後者要靠精力；前者亦表孝思，人家決不來査査你家譜，問你尊大人生卒年月。要是這兩套今年已做過，不妨：「岳母大人懸孤」，寄伯大人大壽」等等發出去。如果你有點兒來歷，無妨就把「上海名人錄上的人物都寫在帖子上，他們拜聆大名之下，不怕不送。</p>
<p>目今的季候呢，如果受了賀儀，備酒席中餐一百元，西餐至少十番，外加啤酒喜封；要挖打些，每人祇一客「經濟運交飯」，好像自古未嘗有之，因此，假使是打秋風的話，還待考慮；但如果擺闊，則藍棉白棉，五百一千，小大由之；而且臨末登報啓事：「所受鴻儀，齊數送交慈善機關」，樂得給人家捧上一陣。</p>
<p>然而要是暴發戶罷，他們對窮親戚就不放鬆，這與「秋風」雖有虎狗之差，存心則與慈禧太后差太監送糕餅數色給窮貝勒相同，喜封不可少，賀儀就得看得過。雖然其實是揚眉吐氣。</p>
<p>最新的方法，就不要抄老文章：如果表示身份，你定上一千元一桌不算，劃出經費一部分交慈善機關之外，賀儀決不收受分文，外加一二紀念贈品，使他們抹抹嘴就可滿載而歸。——這才闊綽。</p>
<p>這好像要都叫賀客做難民了。但提倡之下，此風一開，受惠者必夾道歡呼稱頌無已。</p>
<p>綜匕所述，似乎有着淸客馮　替孟嘗君焚債券式的嫌疑；然而人們永遠要那般風頭出下去，總有一天「賴債不如賴人情」，窮親友會自動賴掉的。無法登門坐索。</p>
<p>但如果：如爸死娘葬，自己做新郞，這繁文褥節親友們雖有皺眉之痛，於世故人情就可不得不應酬一下。禮記云：「法施於民則祀之，以死勤事則祀之，以勞定國則祀之，能禦大舊則祀之，能捍大患則祀之。」阿彌陀佛！</p>

<p>— 無為</p>
<p>坐車子本來不是一件隨便的事情。你看「大衆可坐，穩快價廉」的電車，除了偶然有一二輛定備車，在軌道上拖着空壳子，深夜或侵晨米往騁馳之外，簡實像新買來的一盒火柴，充滿着藥頭的一端，非用些氣力是不易推開那蓋子的。因之等電車固然要有耐心，而上電車更須富有膂力；所謂「大衆」也者，似乎巳把老弱婦孺撇開了。至於票價的一再增加，離那「廉」字也有些「一行白鷺上靑天」的樣，愈弄愈遠哩。</p>
<p>蛋糕式的雙層公共汽車，情形也和電車相仿，有時候顏簸起來，好像騎了一匹劣馬，大有八段錦上「背後七顚百病消」之概，非身心健全者，休想不因之而頭昏腦漲。</p>
<p>當然，坐汽車最舒適了。然而談何容易，私人汽車非富有者不辦；出差汽車，在祥生鬥口未打籬笆之前，已漲至每二十分鐘十大元（小賬在內），如果一天來回兩次，每月非有六百元的支出，一個身子就動彈不得了。汽車汽車眞造談何容易呢！</p>
<p>返回大自然去，還是以他人之腿代自己的腿吧，唯一的出路只有人力車了。不管健步如飛的壯漢，或是「年高德劭」的老槍車夫，在和他們討價還價之時，眞是頭痛不堪。要是碰釗天雨，說不定車子沒有坐成功，而彼此先要傷和氣呢。</p>
<p>說來說去，坐車子雖是小事，細細硏究起來，委實很多麻煩。求人不如求已，當然妙莫妙於安步當車了。可是仔細想來，也有未妥。要是風和日麗，在人跡較稀的馬路上閒蕩小步，雖走五六里路不覺累倦。像這幾天西北風吹在面上，在人行道上擠來擁去，味亦缺缺。若是每天穿皮鞋，走石子路，拼命和鞋底為難，照市價一百餘元一雙皮鞋來算，跑了一年路，支出亦極可觀。只有幾套破舊西裝的人們，速穿布底鞋子的機會都沒有。</p>
<p>坐馬車根本談不上，騎脚踏車也須備具多種條件，那末怎樣才好呢？行不得也哥哥！</p>
<h3 id="c44">一五　爸爸，賣唱去吧！ <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>

<p>「別忙，一切事都算在我們身上！那靑年人一聽，便忙着旋過身子去，用相當强硬的語氣回答：「誰愛上巡捕房去，咱們馬上就去！……」</p>
<p>梅寳扶着她父親，一面念忙忙的打過道裏走出去；一面還在留心傾聽房裏頭雙方的爭論，心內不知怎樣，覺得非常不安。她憂慮那三位簪他們解圍的客人會和那一對醉鬼衝突起來，特別是那一位年紀最輕的學生模樣的人，她不忍敎他吃虧。可是這時候，她第一還得先伴着她父親脫離這是非窩，當然不能獨自冉退回去。</p>
<p>「今兒眞虧了那三位客人！」一到街上，韓家姑娘便瀋形於色的向秋海棠和梅寳這樣說。</p>
<p>秋海棠只是默然不語。</p>
<p>「但願別連累了人家！梅寳用極低的聲音回答。她彷彿看見那個學生模樣的靑年人的腦袋，已給小胖子丟過一個菜盆來砸破了。（二九一）</p>

<p>— 適誠</p>
<p>我的姊夫是在香港經商的，這一次戰事爆發，我們全家的人——尤其是我的姊姊——都很為他担憂。</p>
<p>前天上午，狡猾的騙子就利用這一個機會，光臨到我們的家中，他目己介紹着說：「我是剛從九龍來的，陳先生（指我的姊夫）已逃到九龍，在開船的那一晚，他囑託我到上海來後吿訴你們聲，如果有辦法，想立即能回到上海來」。我們聽了後，心中都很焦急。他停了一回，繼續說道：「如果要從九龍回到上海，我有一個辦法，不過必定先要在上海登記。」我們聽到有辦法一三個字，心中都很高興，就急忙問他登記的手續，他回答說：「在上海登記，需手續費﹑一百兀，登記後我就可把陳先生藏在我的船中，五六天後就可以回到上海。」我們被盼」。「姊夫回來的心所驅使，凑滿了二百尤交給那自稱從九龍來的人，還說了許多感謝他的話。他收了錢並對我們說：「二小時後，我可以給你們一個回音，現在我立即去登記。」</p>
<p>到現在巳經有幾十個二小時，那個騙子就這樣一去不回了。</p>

<h3 id="c46">一年來藝壇大事記（上） <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— 景毅</p>
<p>一年忽忽又過去，照例在這新舊交替的時候，各方面都得有個總結算，在藝壇上，我們不妨也來替牠淸算一下，這一年中，確實也產生了不少新的變動，茲就電影和話劇方面的幾件大事，分別記載出來；</p>
<p>（甲）小規模公司活躍戰後本市正式製片的公司，僅有「國聯」「國華」和「藝華」三家，以後雖也產生了「民華」「金星」等兩三家，但在今年，小規模的公司却像雨後春筍似的勃發起來，雖然他們由於資本和攝影塲址等關係的牽制不能盡量的發展，但都能在埋頭苦幹下製造出一兩部作品，據筆者所知的，計有大風」「大年」「大成」「大同」「華年」「美成」「聯星」「華藝」「聯藝」等。</p>
<p>（乙）國聯的巨片「家」國聯以巨大資本動員合作攝製了文壇上巴金的名著「家」為電影，這裏搜羅了整個影壇的第一流大明星和大導演，在一年餘人力物力的消耗之下，終於在今秋完成而公映了。最高座價售至八元，這在中國影壇上確是空前創舉，而使電影史上留下光榮的一頁。</p>
<p>（丙）恐怖影片的崛起在戰前有過一部恐怖片「夜半歌聲一，當時也曾震驚銀擅，但這類影片以後就很少發現，然而本年來由於大量觀衆對於恐怖劇材料熱烈愛好，恐怖片應運而生，竟佔了全部產量的十分之三，鬼怪僵屍之類的東西，充斥皆是，而目大都粗製濫造，不値一看，截至目前，尙有很多在攝製中，這可說和當時古裝民間雷影同樣的畸形發展。</p>
<p>（丁）大上海改映國片大上海為全巿穴大影院之一，民國二十年開幕後，即專映外片，今夏由虞洽卿氏斥資盤下，委由張善琨盛丕華任矜蘋組織伍德公司經營該院業務，而改為專映首輪國片，在本年九月二十四日隆重開幕，從此國片戲院也有偉大建築，不讓外片戲院專美於前了。</p>

<p>— 頋明道</p>
<p>第二十章　蠟炷迎來在戰塲</p>
<p>許靖道：「二哥，你以為吳將軍得了圓圓，私事已畢，便要為國戮力嗎？唉！我看吳將軍從此銷金帳中，長效于飛之樂，繡玉樓上，時學畫眉遺韻，國家的事那裏在他心上呢？」柳隱英微微一笑。張蒼虬等，初聞此信，以為吳三桂或要回京去和攝政王折衝樽俎之間，以便召集遺老大臣，共商如何續立明主的事，所以對於吳三桂於失望之中尙帶有一點不絕如縷的期待，很快活的和大軍一起回轉北京。恰逢攝政王正在懸掛素綵，佈吿吏民，為明室帝后發喪。三桂是明臣，當然要到宮中去拜祭。攝政王見他回來，很是驚異，待他十分優渥。當夜設筵享三桂，有諸親王　陪。酒酣，攝政王屛退左右，和吳三桂談了好一刻秘密的話。吳三桂辭出後，明日卽掃除故邸，為金屋藏嬌之謀，安置了圓圓。又令馬寳白顯忠柴英等諸心腹將領入見，各和他們密談了數語。又出余銀犒賞三軍。次日却稱病不出，一連三天沒有動靜。各將領也都置酒高會，狀態閒暇，絕不提及國家大事。張蒼虬等又覺小耐煩了。有一天，四個人聚在張蒼虬營房中叙談。張蒼虬首先嘆道：「俺們弟兄四人跟隨吳將軍，雖則要想立些戎馬之功，圖個出身，心裏也想為朝廷復仇，安定國家。那裏知道徒為他人造機會？俺咋向馬守備探詢過。他也呑呑吐吐，不肯直說呢。」陳飛道：「吳將軍得了圓圓，迷變溫柔鄉中，無復大志。小弟看來，他也無能為力了。（二五二）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Bombing of the Malay Coast, Fierce Fighting in the Ipoh Area, Japan Claims Occupation of North Borneo's Capital <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Singapore, 29th (Havas) - The British Far East Command headquarters issued a battle report today stating that on the Malay front, the two armies have made contact south of Ipoh, the capital of Perak. There have been no changes in the war situation in other parts of Malaya. Several Japanese aircraft bombed and strafed positions along the southern coast of Kwantan. A report from Sarawak, North Borneo, confirms that Kuching, the state capital, has been occupied by Japanese forces.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Domei) - The Japanese Army General Headquarters announced at 5:35 PM today that the Japanese army in Malaya captured Ipoh, the capital of Perak State, yesterday afternoon. Japanese troops are advancing south.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 29th (Haitong) - Singapore news on Sunday night indicates that the Japanese army in southern Malaya has received reinforcements. Singapore believes that the main target of the Japanese army is Ipoh, so a major offensive towards Singapore has now begun. According to British reports, the Japanese army is now in Chemore, just ten miles from Ipoh. This area is located on the highway and railway line that runs through northern and southern Malaya. From Chemore, there are multiple small roads leading to Ipoh's tin mines. It is reported that the two armies are now engaged in fierce fighting on the Perak River, and Japanese troops have crossed the river at several points.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Domei) - The Japanese Army and Navy General Headquarters jointly announced this afternoon that the Japanese army, which landed in southwestern British Borneo on Wednesday morning, occupied Kuching, the capital of Sarawak, yesterday. This is an important British air base. The Japanese Navy, operating in nearby waters, sank two submarines and shot down one aircraft.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Haitong) - Last night, authoritative sources here stated that after the Japanese army occupied the ports of Miri, Seria, and Labuan on the northern coast of Borneo, the oil production of British Borneo has completely fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. As a result, Japan's fuel situation has greatly improved, so the Japanese government has relaxed restrictions on gasoline. Trucks and coastal steamships have been granted gasoline, and Japan's transportation has greatly improved. Since the northern Borneo ports were occupied, Singapore's gasoline supply will depend entirely on Sumatra. After Penang Island and Victoria were lost, transporting oil from Burma to Singapore is also impossible. As for transporting oil from Sumatra to Singapore, it is also threatened by Japanese aircraft due to the new Japanese air base recently established on Penang Island.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Little Change in the Battle Situation on the North and South Routes of the Philippines <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Manila, 29th (Havas) - Regarding the fighting on Luzon Island, local officials did not issue a statement today. However, military authorities stated that the Japanese army's advance on the northern and southern parts of Luzon Island has slowed down. The Japanese army is now redeploying and preparing to launch a major battle in northern Luzon.</p>
<p>Manila, 29th (Havas) - This morning's battle report stated, "The advance of the American and Filipino forces is proceeding step by step, and there are no major battles in the north." It is also known here that fierce fighting has also broken out in southeastern Luzon. Organized destruction by Filipino forces has slowed the progress of the Japanese army in Lingayen Gulf. Furthermore, yesterday's bombing of Manila by Japanese aircraft resulted in only three injuries and no deaths.</p>
<p>Manila, 28th (Havas) - The U.S. Far East Command Headquarters recently issued a battle report stating, "The Japanese army is pressing towards us from southern Philippine Islands, and our army is bravely resisting. There are no fierce battles in the northern area." Furthermore, according to official announcements, fierce fighting is currently taking place near the city of Tayug, 140 miles north of Manila and 40 miles east of Lingayen Gulf. Over the past 48 hours, the city has been lost and regained no less than several times and is currently still under the control of the American and Filipino forces. The war situation in Pangasinan province is chaotic. According to the governor's report, the whereabouts of eight cities are unknown, "presumably having fallen into the hands of the Japanese army."</p>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Domei) - According to Manila news, Japanese aircraft attacked Manila's port facilities and ships in the Pasig River twice this morning at 11:24 AM, lasting two hours. The damage is unknown, but it was heard that the area was still burning at 4:30 PM.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 29th (Haitong) - A report has been received stating that Cebu, the second largest city in the Philippines, was bombed by Japanese aircraft last Wednesday.</p>
<p>Washington, 29th (Havas) - Sources familiar with the situation here recently stated that government authorities have agreed on a plan that if the US military is forced to abandon Luzon Island, the Philippine government will relocate to Washington, D.C. This is not to say that the war in the Philippines has failed, but rather to prove that the Filipino people still wish to be in the position of a belligerent nation in the current war, willing to aid freedom and independence.</p>

<p>Delhi, 28th (Reuters) (Relayed from Chongqing) - A spokesman for the British Indian Army Headquarters stated today that the importance Britain attaches to Burma can be seen by General Wavell's willingness to appoint his Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Hutton, as the commander of the British army in Burma. We must hold Burma for two main reasons:</p>
<p>*   If the Japanese army gains a solid foothold in Burma, they will gain air bases with a range to attack most of India, as well as submarine bases that could attack shipping and ports in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>*   Burma is an important transportation hub, and the Burma Road is the main route for maintaining the supply of military supplies to China. The military spokesman continued that one of the tasks of General Wavell's trip to Chongqing was to discuss general issues related to the defense of Burma and maintaining traffic on the Burma Road. Major General Brett, commander of the US Army Air Forces, who accompanied Wavell to Chongqing, discussed US aid issues with the Chinese authorities. This issue is closely related to US aid to Burma's defense. U.S. aircraft and pilots are now playing an important role in defending Burma. Although Japanese aircraft have repeatedly bombed Rangoon, the losses have not been severe. After General Wavell assumed responsibility for Burma's defense, he is now responsible to the British government for the defense of a vast territory including Iraq, northern Iran, Ceylon, and Burma, and to the Indian government for the defense of India. The new commander of the British army in Burma, Lieutenant General Hutton, has arrived in Burma to take office.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Domei) - "Nichinichi Shimbun" today carried a Bangkok dispatch stating that the British have obtained the assistance of the Chongqing and U.S. Air Forces and two divisions of the Indian Army to strengthen the defenses of Singapore and Rangoon. Chinese pilots and American pilots are now concentrated in Rangoon and Toungoo flying ports. Another U.S. aircraft squadron has arrived in Singapore to assist in the protection. Indian troops are currently on their way to Singapore and Burma.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Haitong) - "Nichinichi Shimbun" received a dispatch from Bangkok stating that after Hong Kong was occupied by the Japanese army, the British headquarters' plan to rescue Singapore has entered a new phase. Although the British army is constantly reinforcing Malaya, whether Singapore can be preserved is still questionable. Britain is now planning to establish a second line of defense in Burma. A large number of troops are concentrated on the line from Rangoon to Mandalay. The city of Mandalay seems to be the fortress of the so-called "second line of defense in Asia." The newspaper also stated that according to the results of the Sino-British-American military conference held in Chongqing, Chongqing will send part of its air force to Burma to fight.</p>
<h3 id="e6">U.S. Fleet Bides Its Time <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Washington, 28th (Havas) - Many people wonder why the U.S. fleet is "standing still." Local naval strategists replied, "Wait patiently." The U.S. Navy has not abandoned its traditional offensive strategy and is waiting for the right opportunity to strike. The Japanese fleet has not concentrated on a large scale, but is only covering troop transport, and the United States is reducing the risk of major contact. This situation may continue for several months or even a year. In addition, the United States is unwilling to engage in major naval battles before its aircraft outnumber Japan's. Japan currently has many long-established air bases on the land, which is conducive to combat. The content is mainly to protect key locations. British Prime Minister Churchill and his entourage arrived in Canada.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Roosevelt and Churchill Conclude Meetings, Allied War Plans Drafted, the Content is Mainly to Protect Key Locations, British Prime Minister Churchill and his Entourage Arrive in Canada <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Washington, 29th (Havas) - According to official news, the 1942 Allied war plan is said to have been drafted. Its content is mainly to protect key locations. The so-called key locations are Singapore and Hawaii in the Pacific, Malta in the Mediterranean, Alexandria in Egypt, and the Moscow-Rostov line. Relying on these fortresses, the Allies can maintain a land front in Europe and maintain control of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, and North Africa. In addition, although the safety of the Philippines is extremely important, it is considered unwise to transfer troops from Singapore to aid the Philippines.</p>
<p>Mexico City, 29th (Haitong) - Well-informed American sources revealed that Roosevelt and Churchill had agreed on a combat strategy during their meeting in Washington. The details are strictly kept secret. It is heard that the outline of the plan was drafted by American politicians, and its main purpose is to contain the Axis powers' forces until the democratic countries manufacture armaments and replenish their military equipment.</p>
<p>New York, 28th (Havas) - Regarding the issues discussed by British Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt, officials have not released any concrete information. However, according to local newspapers, the two either discussed unifying command in each dispute or studied "joint military action plans." For example, the New York Times stated, "Our country is not only at war with Japan, but we should not ignore some more urgent and important goals. The scope of our actions must be expanded to all theaters of war around the world and actively strive for the common goals of the anti-Axis countries. To achieve this goal, we must formulate joint plans for unified strategy. Every country must be prepared to sacrifice for the benefit of the whole. In the United States, even sacrificing the traditional pride of the American people is necessary."</p>
<p>Washington, 29th (Havas) - President Roosevelt held a meeting with British Prime Minister Churchill at the White House today, lasting 40 minutes. Ambassadors from South American countries were also present. Roosevelt and Churchill both gave speeches during the meeting, with the general meaning being the same, believing that they would be able to achieve final victory. However, the Allied war plan was not explained in detail. As for the ambassadors from the South American republics, with the exception of Colombia, Brazil, and Panama, all expressed their gratitude for Roosevelt and Churchill's invitation to the ambassadors of their countries to attend the meeting, and hoped that the various economic and military problems caused by the United States' entry into the war could be resolved at the Pan-American Conference to be held in the Brazilian capital on January 15 next year. Although, according to some diplomats, the Pan-American Conference can only make the Pan-American republics reiterate that they maintain relations between countries, only a few urgent issues should be discussed.</p>
<p>Washington, 28th (Havas) - How the world situation will evolve after the end of the current war has attracted the attention of political figures here, and some advocate the establishment of an international organization to carry out the tasks of the 1919 League of Nations. These people say that the United States cannot remain isolated and turn a blind eye to events in other parts of the world. International cooperation and collective efforts to maintain future peace are necessary. This is what former US President Wilson hoped for in 1918. At that time, he strongly advocated the principles of the League of Nations, with the League of Nations representing the ideals of the people of all countries and preventing war from happening again. In general, people also had high hopes for the League of Nations. However, the establishment of this international organization coincided with the rise of nationalism, and the United States' failure to recognize it was a fatal blow. For this reason, once the current war is over, everyone should understand that all countries after the war have countless orphans and widows, and it is urgent to recuperate. Therefore, the establishment of international organizations to maintain peace is necessary.</p>
<p>Ottawa, 29th (Havas) - Prime Minister Churchill left the United States for Canadian territory last night and is expected to arrive here at 10:00 AM this morning.

<p>Stockholm, 29th (Haitong) - According to London news, British Foreign Secretary Eden met with a Chinese military delegation in Moscow.</p>
<p>Moscow, 22nd (Havas) - After British Foreign Secretary Eden met with Soviet leaders here, the British and Soviet Union recently issued a joint communique stating that [British Foreign Secretary Eden held talks with Soviet Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars Stalin in Moscow in late December 1941, exchanging views. Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Stafford Cripps, British Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Sir Alexander Cadogan, British Deputy Chief of the General Staff General Nye, all participated in the meeting. The attitude of both parties was sincere, and full agreement has been reached on several key points, especially the complete defeat of Nazi Germany and the adoption of measures to prevent Germany from taking new military actions in the future. In addition, views were exchanged on the issue of postwar peace and security organizations, and some important information has been obtained, which will greatly facilitate the establishment of concrete proposals. Both parties also believe that this talk is an important step for the reconciliation between Britain and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Domei) - When Masaki Tani, a spokesman for the Japanese Information Bureau, entertained reporters today, he mentioned the Japanese-Soviet negotiations, predicting that a permanent fisheries agreement could be concluded.

Tani replied to another question saying that the current Japanese-Soviet relations are quite harmonious, and the Japanese side is very satisfied with this, and that the relations between the two countries are still based on the Neutrality Pact.</p>
<h3 id="e9">President Roosevelt Convenes Supreme Military Conference, Brief Biographies of Five U.S. Army and Navy Commanders <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Washington, 28th (Havas) - President Roosevelt met with leaders of the Army and Navy today for an hour. Secretary of the Navy Knox, Secretary of the Army Stimson, Army Chief of Staff General Marshall, Air Force Chief of Staff General Arnold, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Fleet Admiral King, and Director of Naval Plans Rear Admiral Turner all attended the meeting. However, no British representatives were present. It is heard that today's meeting was actually the highest military conference in the United States.</p>
<p>New York, 28th (Havas) - Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, there have been many changes in the command of the U.S. Army and Navy. Those currently responsible for combat include Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Fleet Admiral Ernest King, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark, Commander of the Asiatic Fleet Admiral [Blank], Army Chief of Staff General Marshall, and Commander of the Far East Command General MacArthur. The biographies of each person are briefly described as follows.</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Fleet Admiral Ernest King was born in Ohio, has served as captain of an aircraft carrier, and has special research on submarine warfare and various air force issues. Since future wars are based on the joint operations of the Navy and Air Force, Admiral King's appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Fleet is extremely important.</p>
<p>Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark's primary task is to establish close contact between the government authorities and the Navy Department. In other words, he serves as a liaison between the people and the Navy and is directly responsible to the President of the United States. His only superior is the President of the United States. However, Admiral Stark is neither a naval admiral who formally commands the fleet nor a naval officer who serves on land. But according to naval tradition, he must often sail to participate in military affairs. In addition, the Admiral is a first-class administrative expert in the United States and has strong organizational skills.</p>
<p>Commander of the Asiatic Fleet Admiral [Blank], although he has reached retirement age, still holds the position of commander. The reason for this is probably because he is good at submarine warfare.</p>
<p>Army Chief of Staff General Marshall is a graduate of the Virginia Military Institute and did not attend West Point Military Academy. This is different from most U.S. Army generals. Marshall actively participated in the last World War. He also participated in the Battle of Saint-Mihiel in France and won glorious achievements.</p>
<p>Commander of the Far East Command General MacArthur is the son of a general and has served in the army since childhood.</p>

This matter was announced by General Leeb, commander of the Northern Route, at a military officers' meeting on Christmas Day. It is said that in the past few months, it has been difficult for the German reserve army to go to the rear bases, because all traffic routes have been reserved for troops going to the first line. Now, during the winter truce period, the German General Headquarters has managed to improve it. The German military center of gravity in Poland has now shifted eastward and is very close to the front line, which can provide many conveniences.

<h3 id="e22">Checks for Electricity Bills Can Be Cashed Without Limit; Electric Power Industry Maintains Operations; Telephone, Water, and Gas Companies Enjoy the Same Convenience to Maintain Business <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Industries in Shanghai, both British and American-owned, that rely on electricity for their operations can now withdraw funds from banks without limit to pay for electricity, thus ensuring the continued supply of power. This is the most important consequence of the announcement made by the Public Works Department last Saturday.</p>
<p>Check Cashing</p>
<p>The notice stipulates that all bank checks signed for services provided by the electricity company will be cashed by the respective banks. It is found that most of the important factories in Shanghai use electricity to operate, and the source of electricity largely depends on the Shanghai Electric Power Company. The electricity produced by the company accounts for 70% of the total electricity production in the city, of which 80% is supplied to the city's industries.</p>
<p>Difficulties Avoided</p>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Power Company is the largest industrial investment of American companies in China and has been taken over by the Japanese. Many difficulties have arisen in paying electricity bills. Now that the Public Works Department has announced that checks paid to the company will be cashed, these problems have been temporarily resolved. The other three public utilities that enjoy the same convenience are the American-owned Shanghai Telephone Company, the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company, and the Shanghai Gas Company. The other two public utilities in the Public Concession, namely the British-owned Tramway Company and the Public Bus Company, receive income in cash, so they are not related to the Public Works Department's announcement.</p>

Now that the port has been occupied by the Japanese army, the shipping matters between Shanghai and Hong Kong urgently need to be restored. The authorities are planning to transport necessities such as rice and coal from Hong Kong to Shanghai to provide relief.</p>

<p>The survey on the living conditions of Chinese white-collar families, organized by the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Public Works Department, was originally scheduled for three months. It is heard that December of this year is the last month, and it will come to an end after the record is completed. The income and expenditure account book for this month is scheduled to be handed over by the accounting families to the staff at the counter of the nearby post office on January 2, 1942, to be returned to the bureau to avoid errors. The analysis of the account book is complicated, and the accounting families should return it on schedule to facilitate the process. The following points should also be noted: All items purchased but not used at the end of this month should be filled in Table 4 in the book to facilitate the calculation of consumption quantity within three months. Those who have not yet filled in Table 2 should fill in the dimensions of each room, the number of windows, and other items. All items of income and expenditure should be checked one by one to see if there are any duplicates or omissions. Whether the filling of the record book is in accordance with the regulations, and whether the questions in the record book are in accordance with the regulations. This record keeping makes a great contribution to the public, and it must be consistent from beginning to end to avoid failure. The Bureau expresses its deep gratitude for the efforts of the accounting families.</p>
<h3 id="e25">This Month's Cost of Living Index Shows Both Increases and Decreases <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>For the past two and a half years, the cost of living index for Chinese workers in this city has been rising monthly. However, since the Public Works Department managed the prices of major commodities, general retail prices have stopped rising. The total index for December of this year is 1194.25 (1936 equals 100), a slight increase of 1.66% compared to last month. Among the sub-indices, only the food category increased slightly by 3.36%, while the rest decreased. In the first half of this month, the prices of major consumer goods, such as food, fuel, fish, meat, oil, and bean products, all rose, but then stabilized. The items used in the index, such as rice, flour, lard, vegetable oil, coal briquettes, etc., are all subject to management and limited sale prices. In the middle of this month, some items were in limited supply, and citizens had to purchase alternative products, which caused the price of sliced noodles to soar, once reaching 1 yuan and 62.5 cents per catty, but was later limited to 95 cents.</p>
<p>Western Residents' Commodity Index Slightly Decreases</p>
<p>Although the Pacific War has broken out, the cost of living index for Western white-collar workers in December has changed slightly. The overall index decreased slightly by 5%, which is because the Concession authorities manage prices for a wide range of foreign goods. The fourth and third price limit lists for canned goods were announced to supplement the shortcomings of the previous two lists. The price-limited items for foreign salaried class have reached 450 items, everything that should be there. The selling prices of coal, bread, and flour were also stipulated this month. Therefore, although shipping has been interrupted since the 8th and imported goods cannot be replenished, prices have been suppressed due to management. However, some of the things needed by foreign residents are no longer available, such as gasoline and cars. Supplies of things such as kerosene are insufficient. Now, taking October 1939 as the base period, the December composite index fell from 369.08 in the previous month to 367.127, which is due to the price limit on coal. The average selling price of Hongji lump coal per ton in November was 83.909 yuan, and it dropped to 664.17 yuan in December. Other sub-indices increased, with food increasing by 2.74%, clothing by 3.39%, and miscellaneous items by 0.76%, while fuel decreased by 14.28%.</p>

The original treatment was meager and the expenditures were huge. The methods for improving treatment were put forward, including increasing wages and allowances from January, adding a small account for sending vegetables, abolishing the double salary at the end of the lunar year, and distributing dividends, giving each worker two days off per month, etc., with nine articles requesting the capital side to accept and implement them, so as to maintain the workers from freezing and starving. They also filed a document requesting the authorities to serve as mediators. On the 16th of this month, representatives from both labor and capital were summoned to open up negotiations, but the opinions of both sides were at odds, resulting in a stalemate. It is reported that the authorities, in order to eliminate this dispute as soon as possible, have decided to summon the representatives of both sides, Cai Min, Xu Zhongshi, Ji Kuizhang, and Xu Zhixia, etc., again tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. for fair negotiations, in order to achieve a reasonable solution as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Shirt and Sock Dispute Under Investigation</p>
<p>Recently, various shirt, sock, and knitting factories in this city have been unable to continue operating due to the shortage of raw materials, the strange increase in costs, and the sluggish export of finished goods, and are about to announce their closure. The workers were greatly alarmed when they heard the news, and on the 20th of this month, they sent representatives to request the authorities to instruct the factories to maintain operations. It is reported that the authorities are sending personnel to investigate the business conditions and sales methods of each factory in order to start mediation.</p>

After receiving the news, the French Concession Fire Brigade rushed several fire trucks to put out the fire, which was extinguished in about two hours. It is reported that many rooms inside were burned down and the neighboring houses were affected. The timber pile was very large and the losses were severe.</p>

<p>Due to the severe cold, homeless people in the two concessions, unable to withstand hunger and cold, died on the roads and in the alleys during the night. The total number on the previous night was 236, setting a new record for this winter. Some of the children's bodies were</p>
<p>Abandoned by Parents</p>
<p>Who were unable to bury them and abandoned them on the roadside. However, according to charity workers, the number of corpses on the road last night was unprecedented this year. There were 59 adult corpses and 88 children's corpses in the Public Concession, and 17 adult corpses and 32 children's corpses in the French Concession. The Public Concession found a total of 545 corpses on the road last week, including 353 children's corpses. The French Concession did not have a precise number of corpses found on the road last week, averaging 23 adult corpses and 48 children's corpses per day. The main reasons for the death of poor people</p>
<p>Is hunger, cold, and opium addiction, but most of the elderly and infirm have no such habits. Although winter relief from various charitable organizations in Shanghai has reduced the number of corpses on the road, the current scope of relief is inadequate. It is hoped that all sectors of society will, in this difficult time, uphold the spirit of compassion and jointly assist.</p>
<p>Public Works Department Restricts Use of Ambulances</p>
<p>The Public Works Department Information Office announced: In order to save fuel, the use of ambulances in the Public Concession will be restricted. The medical community and the public are expected to cooperate. Emergency ambulances are only allowed to be dispatched in the event of an accident in which one or more people are seriously injured. In other cases, other methods of transportation will be used. A wheeled stretcher has now been placed in each police station for use when needed. As for ambulances carrying patients (non-accidental events) to hospitals, they will only be dispatched at the request of a registered physician, and will not be used to transport patients away from hospitals unless requested by the head of the hospital concerned.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Business News - Despite the Fall in Domestic Rice Prices, Rice Panic Remains <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>After a day of closure on Sunday, the supply of domestic rice saw an increase, totaling three to four hundred and thirty shih. Consequently, people's anxieties eased, and purchasing became smoother. Sellers had no choice but to lower prices to sell off their stock. In the morning, early-season rice was priced at 217 yuan, and thin rice at 220 to 215 yuan. However, due to a shortage of high-quality rice, especially Northern Japonica rice, it still opened at 265 yuan. Subsequently, due to a continued lack of inquiries, prices gradually declined, falling to as low as 215 yuan, eventually selling for only 212.5 yuan. Compared to the market price last week, it represents a sharp drop of over ten yuan. Throughout the day, over three hundred bags were displayed on the market, but less than three hundred bags were sold. Newly arrived Yuan rice and previously stored high-quality Jintan rice were priced at 228 to 225 yuan, but buyers only offered 210 yuan. This is because the production of pastries has been banned, significantly reducing consumption, unlike the peak winter season in previous years. Only about a hundred bags were sold. Although there were no formal transactions in foreign rice, it was reported that a few hundred bags of small glutinous rice and other foreign rice were sold off-market at a reduction of two to three yuan from previous prices. Furthermore, the arrival of domestic rice continues uninterrupted, and Wuhu rice can also continue to be supplied. Public sentiment in the market has indeed calmed down. However, regarding the sale of foreign rice, although the Japanese side has successively approved the opening of rice storage facilities, with as many as eight locations, the distribution to rice shops remains uneven. Therefore, the difficulties faced by ordinary people in buying small quantities of rice remain unresolved. It is sincerely hoped that the authorities, under proper management, will quickly plan for the widespread distribution of rice to various rice shops, so that ordinary people can buy rice more easily. In the Nanshi district, although there were further reports of large shipments of Wuhu superior rice arriving, it has not yet been seen being sold at fixed low prices. As a result, the residents of the urban area are already feeling a rice panic. If it is delayed for a few more days, food supplies will be exhausted. It is deeply hoped that the municipal authorities will quickly take remedial measures and open sales as soon as possible so that citizens can rest easy.</p>
<h3 id="e35">All Edible Oil and Grains are Rising in Price <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for miscellaneous grains continued to be strong. Due to the reduced availability of edible oil and soybeans, sellers persistently held firm, raising prices by three to five yuan. The continuous transportation of corn from the north also saw a rise of two to three yuan. Raw peanuts were scarce and subject to hoarding, with prices exceeding the 200 yuan mark. The overall market saw the sale of over a hundred barrels of Dalian soybean oil at a price of 377 yuan, and old barrels at 368.5 yuan. Twenty barrels of Qingdao raw oil were priced at 380 yuan, a hundred dan of Dasheng factory clear oil at 245 yuan, and two hundred dan of rapeseed oil at 270 to 272 yuan. A hundred dan of Dasheng factory rapeseed oil was priced at 270 yuan. Over a hundred bags of Tianjin New Jinyuan were priced at 104 to 105 yuan, and three hundred bags of green beans at 92 to 98 yuan. A cartload of Huangdou from Linhuaiguan was priced at 100 yuan, fifty bags of Chongming sand red beans at 87 to 88 yuan, five hundred bags of Dutch white corn at 50 to 50.05 yuan, over four hundred bags of yellow corn at 48 to 50 yuan, nearly a thousand bags of Saigon new corn at 50 to 51.5 yuan, and Dongzhan corn at 49 to 50.05 yuan. Also, over a hundred tons of Yinghua Company corn were priced at 86 to 88.2 yuan.</p>
<p>Bran, in this area, continues to be in high demand, but supplies are exhausted, and production is low. As a result, the market is gradually rebounding. Yesterday, four hundred bags of Lanhua bran were priced at 53 yuan, and two hundred bags of Sanxin bran at 56 yuan, which is said to be incrementally higher than previous market prices.</p>

<p>Ornamental Gold at 1300 yuan per tael</p>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for cash was fiery, and the upward trend intensified, with prices soaring beyond the 12,000 yuan mark. Amidst the intense buying pressure from a certain gold shop and silver shops from both local and foreign areas, the market price steadily rose. People's sentiments were firm. From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially rose to over 10,000 yuan. A certain money shop was first seen selling ten taels to a gold shop for 11,200 yuan. As gold shops continued to buy and silver shops continued to absorb, it rose another 600 yuan, reaching 11,800 yuan, which was sold by another gold shop and a Hong Kong group. At around 10:30 AM, it retreated to 11,500 yuan. Soon after, a certain gold shop resumed its search, and silver shops from both local and foreign areas competed to buy, with even some speculators joining in. The upward momentum grew even stronger, rising another 900 yuan, surpassing 12,000 yuan and reaching a high price of 12,400 yuan. Finally, with more speculators selling off, it fell back again, with the final price being 12,100 yuan, a sharp increase of 1,300 yuan compared to the final price last Saturday. It has risen for three consecutive days, a total increase of 2,600 yuan. The trading price on that day varied by as much as 1,200 yuan. With trading volumes exceeding a thousand taels, the selling price of ornamental gold per tael by Dashin and other firms rose three times, a total increase of 150 yuan, reaching 1,300 yuan (buying in was reduced by 200 yuan). Officially quoted silver was 16 yuan, while the black market price was 10 yuan with buyers, slightly firm.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for foreign exchange drafts and bills remained unchanged at five yuan per thousand, and the interbank lending rate of the money industry association was six percent.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the price of US dollar notes continue to rise with the price of gold, reaching a high of seventeen yuan at one point. The final price was sixteen yuan and sixty-seven cents. Hong Kong notes were needed for three yuan, and military notes were quoted at three yuan and sixty-five cents.</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market started high, then stabilized, and ended up remaining firm. This was because after the sharp fall in gold, it turned stable, so people's confidence turned for the better. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma factory singles continued to rise by 70 yuan, with the price being 1,920 yuan. Shortly after, it rose to 1,925 yuan, but some profit-takers sold off, and it weakened again, closing at 1,865 yuan. However, the trading volume was about two to three hundred bales. The spot price of 20-count Tiannv was 2,300 bales, Shuangqiu was 1,725 yuan, Shuangma was 2,050 yuan, Lanfeng yarn was 2,400 to 2,375 bales (warehouse receipt), 42-count Feng was 3,850 to 3,780 yuan, and 16-count Hongkui Xing was 1,720 to 1,670 yuan.</p>
<p>The Dajing Exchange will resume operations next spring, and the Shuangma factory order was settled at the closing price of 2,190 yuan. It is currently in the process of liquidation.</p>
<p>It is heard that after discussions among the brokers of the Jin Shuangma futures yarn market, it has been decided that transactions made before the 8th will be settled at the closing market price of the 6th, as the standard for both parties to settle the price. The closing market prices for December are calculated as 2270.00, January as 2360.00, and February as 2440.00. However, there is still no definite news on when the market will open.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Factory Cloth Slightly Active <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The factory cloth market was stable yesterday, and wholesale business in this area was slightly active. Sixteen-pound Huadie coarse cloth was the firmest and most expensive, with spot prices opening at 100 yuan. Sixteen-pound coarse twill was 81 to 82 yuan, eleven-pound Yihé coarse cloth was 70.05 yuan, and nine-pound was 60 yuan, all fresher than last weekend. The price of Shilin blue cloth was also not loose. Only white greige fine cloth and fine twill sold the most quickly. Fugui fine cloth was quoted at around 80 yuan, with no transactions. About one hundred and several tens of pieces of dyed cloth, flannel, thread, tweed, and coarse cloth were traded in this area.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth started high, then declined, and ended with a slight drop in fine cloth. Serge remained very firm. The opening price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth factory orders in the morning was shouted up to 81.5 yuan, but as spot goods were weak and buyers were scarce, it fell to 80.025 yuan. At closing, mid-range Caiqiu and Yanghe opened at 75-76 yuan, but also fell back to 75.25 yuan. Junzi Serge new warehouse receipts from October onwards traded at a high of 2.85 yuan and a low of 2.75 yuan, and rose again to 2.805 yuan at noon closing, up 0.005 yuan from last weekend. However, new orders issued before the end of September were considered old orders, so the market price had to be reduced by one to two cents per yard.</p>

Class A bonds initially traded at slightly above 59 yuan, then at 59 yuan. Class C bonds initially traded at 56 yuan, then fell to 5.7 yuan, and then to 55 yuan, with the final sale at 4.9 yuan. Class E bonds traded at 54.2 to 54.3 yuan. The market price can be said to be roughly the same as last week. There is still no definite news about the formal opening of the market, but it is heard that industry insiders plan to start trading on January 5, but it is not known whether it can be realized.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the off-market trading of stocks outside the stock exchange, Jardine Matheson was quoted at around 60 yuan. Ewo Yarns had no fixed market price, but a broker said that the price was about 20 yuan. One said it was only 23-24 yuan.

<p>In these times, it is extremely difficult for an individual to obtain the necessities of life to survive, to struggle and breathe, and to barely manage. But hardship is much better than not being able to survive. This is why even a three-foot-tall child in the ranks of the common people clenches his teeth and dares not leave his line.</p>
<p>But some fat-headed and big-eared people cannot be generalized. They seem to have no worries from birth. If you insist on lamenting the bitterness of the times to them, it will inevitably be very alienating. Their complexions are already very different, and their minds are also different. – However, they may not really be cynical; except for the playboy sons of rich families who are sprawled on cars with their hair combed back like a pompadour and don’t understand human feelings much, most of the smiling, round-faced people are more able to appreciate the ways of the world, and know more about the treachery of the world. – They have clawed their way up like that.</p>
<p>However, some successful people can "play the world" the most because of this. For example, let's take an example: they always do self-promotion – and the easiest way to do self-promotion is to send out invitations. Whether it is for a wedding or a funeral, they always understand etiquette. First, it shows that they have a rich status; second, they cannot help but sponge off people. Suddenly, they have a flash of inspiration, and they print thousands of invitations: "The ninetieth birthday of my late father", "The full-month celebration of my son." The latter requires energy; the former also expresses filial piety. People will definitely not come and check your family tree and ask you about the birth and death dates of your parents. If these two have already been done this year, it is okay to send out invitations for "My mother-in-law has become a widow" or "The birthday of my eldest uncle". If you have some background, you might as well write the names of the "People in Shanghai Who's Who" on the invitations. They will not dare not send a gift after hearing their famous names.</p>
<p>What season is it now? If you receive gifts, prepare a banquet for 100 yuan for Chinese food, and at least ten times that for Western food, plus beer and a red envelope. If you want to scrimp and save, each person only gets an "economical lunch box", as if it has never happened before. Therefore, if you are sponging off people, you still have to consider it; but if you are showing off your wealth, then blue cotton and white cotton, five hundred or a thousand, depending on the size of the event; and at the end, you publish an advertisement in the newspaper: "All the gifts received have been sent to charity organizations." You are happy to have people praise you for a while.</p>
<p>However, if they are nouveau riche, they will not relax their grip on poor relatives. Although this is different from sponging off people, the intention is the same as that of the Empress Dowager sending several kinds of pastries to poor princes via eunuchs. A red envelope is indispensable, and the gift must be decent. Although it is actually to show off.</p>
<p>The newest method is not to copy old articles: If you want to show your status, you book a table for 1,000 yuan, and apart from allocating part of the expenses to charity organizations, you will not accept a single penny of the gift. In addition, you give one or two commemorative gifts, so that they can leave full of gifts. – This is the way to show off your wealth.</p>
<p>This seems to be making it difficult for all the guests to be refugees. But with the promotion of this, once this trend starts, the beneficiaries will definitely cheer and praise endlessly.</p>
<p>In summary, it seems to have the suspicion of Feng Xuan burning bonds for Lord Mengchang; however, people will always want to be in the limelight like that, and one day "defaulting on debts is not as good as defaulting on favors", and poor relatives will automatically default. There is no way to come to the door and demand.</p>
<p>But if: if parents die and are buried, and you are getting married, relatives and friends may have the pain of frowning at these empty formalities, but they will have to deal with them in order to be worldly and human. The Book of Rites says: "If you have made laws that benefit the people, you should be sacrificed to; if you have worked hard and died in your duty, you should be sacrificed to; if you have worked hard to stabilize the country, you should be sacrificed to; if you can resist great disasters, you should be sacrificed to; if you can defend against great disasters, you should be sacrificed to."

<p>— Wuwei</p>
<p>Taking a car is not a casual matter. Look at the trams that are "affordable, stable, fast, and cheap for the masses." Except for the occasional one or two fixed cars that drag empty shells on the tracks and gallop in the middle of the night or at dawn, they are really like a newly bought box of matches. The end full of match heads cannot be easily opened without some effort. Therefore, waiting for a tram requires patience, and getting on a tram requires strength. The so-called "masses" seems to have left aside the old, weak, women, and children. As for the repeated increase in fares, it is a bit like "a line of white egrets flying up to the blue sky" away from the word "cheap", and it is getting farther and farther away.</p>
<p>The situation of the cake-style double-decker buses is similar to that of trams. Sometimes they sway, as if riding a bad horse, and there is a general idea of ​​"eliminating hundreds of diseases with seven back-stretches" on the eight-section brocade exercise. People who are not physically and mentally sound should not think of not feeling dizzy.</p>
<p>Of course, taking a car is the most comfortable. However, how easy is it? Private cars are only for the wealthy; when hiring a car, before the fence was built at the Xiang Sheng intersection, it had already risen to ten yuan every twenty minutes (including tips). If you go back and forth twice a day, you have to spend six hundred yuan a month, and a person cannot move. Cars, cars, it is really not easy to talk about!</p>
<p>Let's go back to nature and use other people's legs instead of our own. The only way out is the rickshaw. Whether it is a strong man who walks like the wind or an old rickshaw puller, it is really a headache to bargain with them. If you encounter rain, maybe you will not be able to get a ride, and you will first hurt each other's feelings.</p>
<p>All in all, taking a car is a trivial matter, but after careful study, there are really many troubles. It is better to ask for oneself than to ask for others. Of course, it is best to walk on foot. But after thinking carefully, there are also imperfections. If the weather is sunny and you stroll leisurely on the less crowded roads, you will not feel tired even if you walk five or six miles. Like these days, the northwest wind blows on your face, and you squeeze and push on the sidewalk, and the taste is also lacking. If you wear leather shoes every day and walk on cobblestone roads, you are desperately making things difficult for the soles of your shoes. According to the market price of more than one hundred yuan a pair of leather shoes, running for a year will also be a considerable expense. Only people with a few sets of old suits do not even have the opportunity to wear cloth-soled shoes.</p>
<p>There is no point in talking about taking a horse-drawn carriage, and riding a bicycle also requires many conditions. So what is the best thing to do? It can't be done, brother!</p>
<h3 id="e42">One Five Dad, Let's Go Busking! <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>"What? You dare to let them go!" Just as the man surnamed Han was thanking the young man, the little fat man inside had already discovered it and shouted loudly.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, everything is on us!" As soon as the young man heard this, he hurriedly turned around and answered in a rather strong tone: "Whoever wants to go to the police station, we'll go right away!..."</p>
<p>Mei Bao supported her father and hurried out of the lane. While doing so, she was still carefully listening to the argument between the two sides in the room. She didn't know why, but she felt very uneasy. She worried that the three guests who had helped them would clash with the pair of drunkards, especially the youngest student-like person. She couldn't bear to see him suffer. But at this time, she first had to accompany her father away from this trouble, and of course she couldn't go back alone.</p>
<p>"We really owe a debt of gratitude to those three guests today!" As soon as she got to the street, Miss Han expressed her gratitude to Qiu Haitang and Mei Bao.</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang just remained silent.</p>
<p>"I hope we haven't implicated them!" Mei Bao replied in a very low voice. She seemed to see the head of the student-like young man being smashed by a vegetable pot thrown by the little fat man. (291)</p>

<h3 id="e43">We Were Cheated <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Shicheng</p>
<p>My brother-in-law is a businessman in Hong Kong. This time, when the war broke out, our whole family – especially my sister – were very worried about him.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday morning, a cunning swindler took advantage of this opportunity to visit our home. He introduced himself and said: "I just came from Kowloon. Mr. Chen (referring to my brother-in-law) has escaped to Kowloon. On the night of the ship's departure, he entrusted me to tell you in Shanghai that if there is a way, he wants to return to Shanghai immediately." After hearing this, we were all very anxious. He paused for a while and continued: "If you want to return to Shanghai from Kowloon, I have a way, but you must first register in Shanghai." When we heard the words "have a way", we were all very happy and hurriedly asked him about the registration procedures. He replied: "To register in Shanghai, you need a handling fee of 100 yuan. After registration, I can hide Mr. Chen in my ship, and he can return to Shanghai in five or six days." We were driven by the hope of "brother-in-law's return" and scraped together 200 yuan and gave it to the man who claimed to have come from Kowloon, and said many words of thanks to him. He took the money and said to us: "I can give you an answer in two hours. I will go to register immediately."</p>
<p>Now it has been dozens of two hours, and the swindler has never returned.</p>

<h3 id="e44">A Chronicle of Major Events in the Art World Over the Past Year (Part 1) <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Jingyi</p>
<p>Another year has passed in a hurry. As usual, at this time of transition between the old and the new, there must be a summary in all aspects. In the art world, we may as well liquidate it as well. This year, there have indeed been many new changes. The following is a record of several major events in the film and drama fields:</p>
<p>(A) Active Small-Scale Companies - The only formal film production companies in this city after the war were "Guolian", "Guohua", and "Yihua". Although two or three companies such as "Minhua" and "Golden Star" have emerged since then, small-scale companies have sprung up like mushrooms after rain this year. Although they cannot develop to the fullest extent due to the restrictions of capital and studio locations, they can all produce one or two works by burying themselves in hard work. As far as the author knows, there are "Dafeng", "Danian", "Dacheng", "Datong", "Huanian", "Meicheng", "Lianxing", "Huayi", "Lianyi", and others.</p>
<p>(B) Guolian's Blockbuster "Home" - Guolian mobilized huge capital and cooperated to produce the film adaptation of Ba Jin's famous literary work "Home". This gathered the top stars and directors of the entire film industry. After more than a year of manpower and material resources, it was finally completed and released this fall. The highest seat price was sold for eight yuan, which is indeed an unprecedented initiative in the Chinese film industry and left a glorious page in film history.</p>
<p>(C) The Rise of Horror Films - There was a horror film "Midnight Song" before the war, which once shocked the silver screen, but this type of film has rarely been found since. However, this year, due to the enthusiastic love of a large number of viewers for horror drama materials, horror films have emerged in response to the trend, accounting for three-tenths of the total output. Things like ghosts and zombies are everywhere, and most of them are crudely made and not worth watching. As of now, there are still many in production. This can be said to be a similarly distorted development as the costume folk lightning movies at that time.</p>
<p>(D) The Great Shanghai Cinema Changes to Screen Domestic Films - The Great Shanghai Cinema is one of the largest cinemas in the city. After opening in 1931, it specialized in screening foreign films. This summer, Yu Qiaqing invested in taking over the cinema and entrusted Zhang Shankun and Sheng Pihua to organize the Wood Company to operate the cinema's business, and it was changed to specialize in screening first-run domestic films. It grandly opened on September 24 this year. From then on, domestic film theaters also had great buildings, so that foreign film theaters were no longer exclusively beautiful.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 20 - Welcoming Candles on the Battlefield</p>
<p>Xu Jingdao said, "Second Brother, do you think that General Wu, having obtained Yuanyuan, will devote himself to the country after his private affairs are over? Alas! I see General Wu will henceforth be in the gilded tent, enjoying the pleasure of flying, learning the legacy of painting eyebrows on the embroidered jade building. The country's affairs are not in his heart at all!" Liu Yinying smiled slightly. Zhang Cangqiu and others, when they first heard this news, thought that Wu Sangui might want to return to Beijing to negotiate with the Regent Prince in order to convene the remaining old ministers and discuss how to continue to establish the Ming Emperor. Therefore, they still had a glimmer of hope for Wu Sangui in the midst of disappointment, and they happily returned to Beijing with the army. It happened that the Regent Prince was hanging plain silk and announcing to the officials and people that he was mourning for the Ming Dynasty empress and empress. Sangui was a Ming minister, so of course he had to go to the palace to pay his respects. The Regent Prince was very surprised to see him back and treated him very favorably. That night, he held a banquet to entertain Sangui, with the princes accompanying him. When the wine was drunk, the Regent Prince dismissed the attendants and talked secretly with Wu Sangui for a long time. After Wu Sangui resigned, the next day he swept away his old residence and planned to hide his beauty in a golden house to settle Yuanyuan. He also ordered his confidants such as Ma Bao, Bai Xianzong, and Chai Ying to enter and meet him, and talked to each of them privately for a few words. He also distributed surplus silver to reward the three armies. The next day, he claimed to be ill and did not go out, and there was no movement for three days in a row. The generals also held banquets and meetings, and their state was leisurely, and they never mentioned state affairs. Zhang Cangqiu and others were a little impatient again. One day, four people gathered in Zhang Cangqiu's barracks to talk. Zhang Cangqiu sighed first and said, "Although we four brothers followed General Wu to establish military merits and seek an official position, we also wanted to avenge the imperial court and stabilize the country. How did we know that we would only create opportunities for others? I asked garrison commander Ma. He also hesitated and was unwilling to say it directly." Chen Fei said, "General Wu has obtained Yuanyuan and is lost in the gentle countryside, and has no great ambitions. In my opinion, he is also powerless." (252)</p>
