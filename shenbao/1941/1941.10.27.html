<h3 id="c27">法國人的苦悶 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>在休戰以後，法國的一切事變過程，完全爲這種判斷錯誤所引起的心理影響支配着，直到今日還是如比。現在維希掌權的人，不但是戰敗的承繼者——這使他們的處境異常困難——而且是他們計算錯誤的承龍者。法國輿論，雖然大多數在希望英國勝利，而法國領袖們的言行，却還是抱着德國的勝利僅係暫時發展的態度。其中像賴伐爾這一輩人，便是準備帮助德國獲勝的。至于貝當元帥等，對于與論感覺敏銳，尙不致于完全忽略民意，他們就想走中立這一條路，像荷比未淪陷前所採取的一樣。這就可以說明維希方面的兩種矛盾現象。</p>
<p>若干法國人以爲這都是很聰明很有權變的辦法。他們說法國人應以本身利益爲主。英國的　利，或于我們更爲有益，但我們不能過分信賴。我們必須是現實主義者。假使希特勒獲勝，我們必須投身於新大陸秩序。這是我們繼續生存的唯一機會。</p>
<p>奇怪得很，這種觀念與美國所謂「妥洽主義者」的見解，甚爲相類。妥洽派相信希特勒統治了美洲以外的世界，美國和希特勒仍可獲得某種妥協。</p>
<p>我個人的意見，以爲他們這種理論，米免把納粹主義的本質，沒有顧到。美國妥洽主義者，意在减輕危險，或許是易解的。以美國這樣的强大，與歐洲又隔着千英里的海洋。德軍要佔領紐約，華盛頓，波士頓和芝加哥。眞是不可思議的事。但是法國的領袖和許多法國平民竟然直到現在，還不能明瞭所謂德國統治的眞意義，即眞是神經錯亂了。</p>
<p>我承認我不能完全說明這一點，而且若干同國入對于法國生存在德國管理之下這一個中心問題的態度，我也感到莫明其妙。我曉得法國有些人，歷年以來，竭力反對民治制度，此次法國的戰敗，他們見已有機可乘，使法國恢復他們所謂命運註定的地位。眞正的法西斯蒂派，君主派，和普通的反動派，正在團結一致，想把一七八九年所定的原則和一百五十年來所獲得的社會幸福一筆勾銷。他們說，民主政治，議會制度，和自由主義，對于盎格魯薩克遜民族或者是有益的。但他們並不是法國人。法國所始終需要而時常回復的，乃是一種個人權力，以國主，皇帝或執政爲統治代表。一七九五年的執政制度，拿破崙即由此崛起的。</p>
<p>雖然我本人絲毫不抱此種思想，但我很願意承認這種思想是頗値一辯的，不妨當她是一個純粹的法國問題來辯論，尤其因戰爭失敗在第三共和國的手裏，而反民治的空氣濃厚，故更須一辯。所不幸的是法國亦像他國一樣，這一次所牽涉的戰爭，其重要遠在法國現在或將來所應採取的政體之上。眞正的衝突，並不在法國的民治獨裁之間，而在納粹統治的根本破壞與西方文化的繼續維持之間。這一個戰爭是具有世界性的。無論法國已不復有力抵抗抗納粹主義是如何可慘，無論英德的繼續戰爭是如何重要，都不過是這次奮鬥中的揷曲而已。眞正的問題是：全無道德的和精神的內容，因此祗能由戰爭和革命毀滅世界的納粹主義，最後是否能把西半球所剩的一片乾凈土，也加以呑沒？或者是：我們這個生氣蓬勃，富有創造天才的西半球，於抵抗東方的虛無一主義，是否會有成功之望？</p>

<h3 id="c28">日軍窺伺滇緬路 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>在湘北與鄂西兩戰役暫告段落之後，在最近日軍會不會再有大規模的進犯？揆之已往一二年中的前例，因爲兵源不足與配備需時，在一個較大規模的會戰之後，日軍總要有相當時期的休息，然後　從事另一攻略，尤以當那一會戰結局是敗衂的時候爲然。只是今日之事，經緯萬端，不容一味據昔以測今、如其因爲日軍甫在湘鄂受創，驟即斷其無力大舉再進，殆屬一無是處。</p>
<p>目前日本大欲在北進南進，對於中國的興趣也許少遜疇昔，然而「解決中國事變」却是歷屆日當局心目中最重要的當前急務，因爲急切中無法從中國戰塲中抽身，所以至今爲止其南進北進都只能以投機取巧乘人之敝的方式去進行，而未使冒然大舉從事，則當其南進北進尙有所待－等待適當時機－之際，其暫又把目標集中到中國原非意外。何况當此美國援華空前積極，如果日本尙不準備立時對美直接決裂，則至少也要打擊美國在遠東的與國。東條組閣後關於政綱的演說首先提到「對中國事變求勝利的解決」究竟東條對此具何抱負和把握，固然無從得悉，但有如美記者施恩所稱日軍將有由越境進攻滇緬路模樣之說，可信將有極大可能。</p>
<p>在一般日人心目中，關於對華戰事，大都把切斷中國外援比較佔領中國後方腹地看得重要，他們始終執着一種偏見，把無從戰勝中國的原因諉過於第三國家，把外援的重要性强調到中國內在的民族潛在力量以上，因此自戰事進人第二期之後，日方對於如何攻略中國後方看得遠不如對於切斷中國外援之置重，固然爲了避重就輕的理由，自以後者較爲輕而易舉，而兩三年來。其對於後者致力更多要屬無可否認的事實。其實遠自戰爭初起日方即宣布封鎖中國沿海，後復相繼佔有廣州汕頭欽防，以至越南重要出海通路的海防河內以至閩浙諸沿海要港，所僅餘者只有西北通蘇境的甘新公路與西南滇緬公路，其運輸能力自遠不能與已失陷的一些海港及河流鐵路相提並論，而中國抵抗力迄未稍見削弱，則可見外援之於中國的對日戰爭只是一個次要的因素而已。</p>
<p>在日本封美對蘇所進行的談判中，幾乎每次都以停止援助中國相要求，而美蘇的堅定立塲則始終並未動搖。自蘇德戰事發生，蘇方自身所需戰具且須仰給英美，其對中國供應减少原無足異，而美國對華的資援則與日俱增，雖較之供給英蘇的戰具容有未逮。究已達空前的程度。以是在美日間斷而復續的談判中間，援華問題當爲雙方重要爭點之一，不過却斷非談判所能獲得妥協，則當美日關係漸形僵化之際，日方之出於直接行動，企圖切斷美戰具運華唯一通路，不只具有可能，且也是日當局所視爲必要的事</p>
<p>一年前日軍進駐越北之後，即有相機進窺滇垣之意，但由越邊以抵滇垣雖僅三百公里之遙，而山川奇險，僅滇越鐵路一綫可通、當時華力即實行封鎖邊境。拆斷鐵路，並留駐大軍　嚴陣相待，以備不虞，日軍如眞進犯。自非等閒可逞，以是亦遂知難而止。此度在越日軍　據聞仍集中海防老開一錢，其仍側重滇越路沿綫可知，則其所遭困難當仍無殊往昔，華方如能加嚴戒備，當可無虞。至於由桂境溯右江以窺滇邊，自南寧收復後已無可能；另一方面，如果日方尙不願立即對英美衝突，則亦未必逕由越北逕犯緬境。</p>
<p>但是不管日軍如何進犯，世人於此實應確認進攻滇緬路一舉的重大意義。在蘇聯，美輪停開海參崴之後，還有波斯灣和亞爾干日爾可資利用，而在自由中國與英美之間，則只餘滇緬路一條通路。滇緬路之受威脅，固非中國之利，但由去秋三個月封鎖的經騐看來，尙絕不足以使中國遭受致命打擊，但遠東ABCD之聯合陣綫却要遭受重大影響，因爲滇緬路在今日已無異於這一合作的象徵與通路。日軍之準備進攻該路，雖藉口於切斷中國生命綫，實則意在拆散此一聯合陣綫的聯繫，使其歸於分離和孤立，則此後的各個擊破當更易爲力。</p>
<p>對於這一具有絕大可能的日軍攻勢，預料中國必要充分盡到保衛自身和遠東的雙重任務；而連日於美海長諾克斯所發表有關遠東的强硬演說之後復有美亞洲艦隊駛抵新加坡的消息，足見英美亦正在加緊戒備中。至於此後大局之發展，則完全要看日本自己作何選擇了。</p>

<p>食油煤斤　計劃公賣</p>
<p>據日文大陸新報記載、工部局爲謀安定物價、並硏究進一步措置、二十三日曾召集進口商舉行物價安定會議、結果擬根據日前決定直接購買麵粉計劃擴充、將購買食油·煤斤等一併包括於該項計劃中、聞工部局刻擬向二十五日來滬之美經濟代表柯克蘭氏、說明上海現狀、並要求柯氏代爲斡旋、俾能獲得外滙、將來該一計劃如能實現、則米·麵·食油·煤斤、均將實行公賣、其他主要日用品、均將實施公定價格制、對於物價安定、或可　到相當效果、</p>
<p>英商決定　防止囤積</p>
<p>滬英僑協會於二十一日舉行例會時、席間曾對工部局抑平物價之措施、表示竭誠擁護、記者頃復自關係方面探悉、英商進口商及英商工廠、認爲本市物價紊亂之主要原因、係由於一般掮客向進口商購進原料後、並不售與工廠、而加以囤積、致造成工廠缺乏原料而停工之嚴重現象、另一部份原因則爲掮客及販貨者、向工廠批得貨物後、並不　與零售店、而亦加以囤積、致若干工廠在原料恐慌之情况下、出產因而减少、無法應付此輩囤預居奇份子之搜求、致一般零售商因無法向工廠購致出品乃轉向囤戶方面搜購、致價格愈抬愈高、造成目前之嚴重局勢、一般英僑進口商人有鑒及此、故決定今後對工廠應用之原料、僅直接售與工廠、不再售給掮客、及販賣者、俾各工廠能維持其出產、而不受囤戶之操縱、各工廠此後之出產品、亦禁止售與掮客及販賣者、而直接分配與零售店、俾使價格以穩定、本埠英商　內門洋行所屬各工廠、祥茂洋行所屬之硫酸廠、及密豐絨綫廠等、均已實行此項辦法、其他英商工廠、亦擬繼續實行、</p>

<p>上海月虧一百餘萬　郵資加價勢在必行</p>
<p>整個郵政經濟之竭蹶、日前已達最高峯、設無國營銀行、爲之透支維持、顯已趨於崩潰停業矣、以上爲上海郵政管理局某一要員向往訪之大通社記者慨乎言之、</p>
<p>運費激增</p>
<p>據渠稱、自軍興以後、交通多阻、郵路壅塞、郵局向恃爲主要收入之包裹業務、幾陷完全停頓、其他郵件運輸上之消耗、爲數亦鉅、而其效率、則反爲事倍功半、由於多方面之原因、郵政收入劇减、而所消耗之交通運費、則反形見增、</p>
<p>全國虧蝕</p>
<p>核算戰後四年中、全國郵政經濟之虧蝕、總數當在五千萬至七千萬元之間、其數至足驚人、即以上海區郵務而言、每月虧折、亦在一百萬元以上、是項虧折差額、幸有國家銀行可資透支、不然、則整個郵政機構早已停滯、郵政經濟、亦早崩潰矣、</p>
<p>必須加價</p>
<p>渠父謂、國內郵資加價問題、認爲非常需要、緣郵資加價、自民國二十一年實行後、至去年始行重加、其所增之數、不足百分之六十、而揆之郵政其他支出、如運費·印刷·紙張以及郵務員工之薪給等、莫不增加在十倍以上、則支出之遞增如此、而收入之增加如彼、此種差額、莫由補償、則當此郵政業務、一落千丈之日、加重困難、寗不殆哉、惟此事尙在行政院審核、實行之期、與所加之數、滬局尙無所聞、渠末謂國外郵資之增加一倍、已定下月一日實行、</p>

<p>今日美國民意對於遠東危機的立塲如何？當日軍開入越南，日本艦隊從側翼威脅菲律賓及美國在太平洋方面的利益時，這問題便居於第一號重要地位了。</p>
<p>自從四年前的夏天，日本開始向中國及南太平洋推進之時起，美國民意測騐所的全國測騐，已紀錄着美國人情緒演進的情形。美國人現在對於整個遠東局勢的看法，已發生了如何重大的變化，頗可於此窺見一斑。</p>
<p>（一）根據四年前測騐的紀錄，美國人對於中日戰爭，大都漫不經心。他們雖對中國表示同情，但至少有一半人相信戰爭前途與美國人無甚關係。及至一九三七年九月問，測騐結果，發現美國人百分之五十五還說他們對於中日戰事前途，保守「中立」或無所抉擇。</p>
<p>（二）美國民意這種態度爲時甚暫，迨日軍深入中國，並向美國駐長江砲艦「潘南」號投擲炸彈，且與德義兩國簽訂同盟條約。其勢力逐漸迫沂菲律賓及南洋廣大的橡膠，煤油，和礦產資源，美國民心方爲之一變。</p>
<p>不到兩年，美國大多數人民便贊成抵制日貨，並嚴厲禁止廢鐵汽油和其他軍用品遝往日本了。從這一點看來，美國民意準備放棄「妥協政策」，實遠較政府爲早，政府宜佈放棄這種政策；還不過是七月間的事呢。</p>
<p>（三）現在新測騐的結果，發現美國大多數人雖不願即與日本明槍交戰，但大數人却信美國應制止日本的勢力，「即使冒戰爭的危險，亦所不辭」。</p>
<p>「美國現在應吾採取各極步驟，防止日本勢力日益膨脹，即使冒戰爭的危險，亦所不惜嗎？」這是美國民意測騐所最近向全國叫十八州的各界有選舉權的人，發出的問題。測騐結果於七月中旬開始揭曉，恰在美國人接到日本進兵越南消息之前。</p>
<p>此次測騐結果如下：</p>
<p>贊成制止日本，即冒戰爭危險亦所不惜者，佔百分之五十一</p>
<p>反對冒戰爭危險以制止日本者，佔百分之三十一</p>
<p>未決定或並無意見者，佔百分之十八</p>
<p>若單就那些表示具體意見的人分析起來，那麽願意對日引起戰爭的危險，以便保衛美國在太平洋方面的利益者，佔百分之六十二，不願如此激進者僅佔百分之三十八而已。</p>
<p>不特此也，美國民意還有一種顯著的趨勢，因爲民意測騐所在不足五個月前，也曾舉行一次測騐，發現贊成美國爲防止日本佔領新加坡及荷屬東印度起見，必要時不惜對日引起戰爭的危險者，僅佔百分之四十。</p>
<p>當時測騐的結果如下（一九四一年三月）：</p>
<p>美國應冒對日作戰的危險，以防其佔領新加坡及荷屬東印度，贊成者，佔百分之十四</p>
<p>反對者佔百分之三十九，</p>
<p>未決定或無意見者佔百分之二十一。</p>
<p>這種轉變以來，美國人的意見可槪括如下：</p>
<p>「日本能切斷美國在遠東的一切貿易。」</p>
<p>「日本如果南進，即等於菲律濱的末日。」</p>
<p>「太平洋的和平將遭受長期打擊。我們務須加緊充實武備。」</p>
<p>「我們在太平洋方面，不能將致命的要害給予日本。」</p>
<p>在最近一次測騐中，選舉人中，承認日本佔領新加坡和荷屬東印度，將予美國安全以切實的威脅者，佔百分之六十，不以爲然者佔百分之二十，並無成見者，也是佔百分之二十。</p>

<p>— 大可</p>
<p>對於上海匯市的維持與放棄，平準會未成立前，中國朝野早在熱烈爭論着。設立平準會，其實就是維持原則的確立。因爲平準兩字，根木包括維持的意義在內。如果放棄，還要平準會幹嗎？傳說中所謂「平準會放棄維持」云云，其實根本不通。以「放棄維持上海匯市」和「放棄維持法幣的對外匯價」混爲一談，更屬不通之尤者。</p>
<p>但從平準會成立以來，諸如此類的謠言，喧傳已非止一次。足見上海在中國金融上的地位業已變遷，否則根本不會發生這種問題。每次謠言發生，市塲上無不極度恐怖；足見上海在中國金融上地位的變遷，亦已爲人人所深稔，方能信而不疑。那末不設法改善上海的地位，而一味希望平準會繼續維持上海，實在也太不近情理。</p>
<p>鑒於這種謠言對於市塲的打擊之大，繼續維持對於上海的繁榮，可見厥功甚偉。如果眞的放棄，上海情形勢必糟到不可收拾。那末凡在享受上海繁榮的人們，都得負起責任來，設法改善上海的地位才行。享受目前上海繁榮的，華人僅佔極少數，大部份是外人，連日本人也在內。對於日人，果已不能有所期望，但日人也得自行反省一番。英美等在滬商行，更應放遠眼光，知所利害。</p>
<p>劉於改善目前上海在中國金融上的地位，豈僅享受繁榮的人們應該負責，其實就是無從享受這種繁榮，甚至正受着這種檠榮壓迫的人們，也得　起一部份責任。試想僅在謠言的威脅之下，所受的物價壓迫，已加重到如此地步。若然成爲事實，壓迫當然更爲嚴重。</p>
<p>改善上海的地位，果係中國整個的間題。但上海人應首先自省，首先負責。此次謠言，雖和過去一樣，又因中國當局重申維持決心而消散了。但上海的情形如果不改善，產生這種謠言甚至事實的因素，決不會消失的。因之平準會今後執行上海滙市平準工作的時候，顯然也非設法改善上海的現實狀况不可。但是要使平準會的工作進行順利，這就有待於上海人的贖罪精神和眞誠合作了。</p>
<p>然則上海在中國金融上所應改善的地位是那幾點呢？扼要言之，可分三端：</p>
<p>（一）糾正平準會維持上海滙市是處於只供無入的地位，可由三途尋求其效果。一由出口商自動將出口滙票結售於平準會；二由承辦申請供給之商行，自行對攏進出口匯票，而請平準會認可或解凍。此兩途之成敗繫於上海人贖罪精神之强弱，而欲確保此一目的之到達，非走第三途不可。即由英美政府宜佈中國領土內所有之一切進出口滙票及其匯兌交易，非經平準會蓋章認可，一概無法律上之效力。</p>
<p>（二）糾正惡用平準會供給之滙票，可由二途尋求其效果。一由承辦申請供給之銀行，負連帶保設之責任。或由平準會指定若干家進出口商行，負責專辦進出口事宜。凡經平準會核准供給外滙之進口交易，必需委託指定之各該商行辦理；而由各該商行負連帶保證責任。至其進口後之躉售價格，亦有各該商行負責監查；如有違約，平準會得追償其所給之外滙。</p>
<p>（三）糾正物價高漲給予滙價之不良影饗，平準會與上海租界當局，應共同負起完全責任。平準會對於米煤兩大絕對必需品，應按期供給定額滙票，不宣與其他進口品同樣辦理。因米煤兩品市價之穩定，其他物價之漲度亦可稍減。但租界常局若不嚴厲執行米煤及其他必需品之平價，平準會之單獨努力實亦難於奏效。故租界當局應斷然取締米煤兩市塲任何貨物之自由漲落，同時禁止其他必需品之售價，而以吊銷營業執照，沒收違法商行所有存貨，並不担保其被沒收後所有債務之償付能力，以爲此項平價工作之後盾。</p>
<h3 id="c52">維持放棄利害若揭　上海的利用價值 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— 華勝</p>
<p>維持上海的匯市，日本所得的利益，遠比中國大。如果斷然放棄，日方所受的打擊，也比中國多。然而中國爲什麼要維持上海？屢决有放棄的謠傳，爲什麼中國總要重申維持的決心？與其說是爲了放棄後，確有若干問題，一時也頗難處理；母寗說中國當局對於整頓上海市塲的企圖，尙未完全絕望；對於擠着四五百萬中外人士的上海，中國當局當不忍走「不敎而誅」的路。這果然是筆者個人的推測，但一比較中外各方面對於上海的利用價値之後，亦可知此種推測，即或不中，亦不甚遠了。</p>
<p>維持時日本有　得遠比中國多</p>
<p>先看上海滙市對於日本的貢獻，主要的有三點：</p>
<p>（一）英美等對日凍結資金後，日圓集團的對外匯價，幾巳根本不能建立。現在牠全靠上海和天津的法幣滙價做基礎，而後以人爲力量提高軍用票和聯鈔對法幣的申水，才能套出牠們的對外滙價，作爲對外貿易上的計價標準。如果上海沒有滙市，日圓集團的價格尺度，勢必極度混亂。那時他要維持對外貿易，更不可能。</p>
<p>（二）上海旣有滙市，上海的對外貿易也就得以維持。因之日本得到法幣，等於得到第三國的軍需原材料。他要得到法幣的辦法很多，如發行雜鈔，征稅苛索，壟斷居奇，對華出口等等。近年來上海的進口貿易，大部份等於是日本的進口。上海滙市維持其自由狀態，日本的利用當然方便。即使經平準會嚴格管理，日本仍能從高價收買中，取之於上海市塲。何况頂買代請外滙等手段，都是日商的看家本領。</p>
<p>（三）上海滙市不關閉，上海的繁榮，也就不會停止。於是集中在上海的財力與勞力，也就不會分散。日本便得間接利用：緊榮淪陷區以遂其以戰養戰的企圖，也就有其可能。</p>
<p>回頭來看上海對於中國的貢獻能，現實的已可謂絕無僅有，但爲未來設想，關係倒也不小。扼要言之，則有：</p>
<p>（一）上海對外貿易中的一部分，原也等於自由區中國的進口；現因日軍加緊沿海的封鎖，以及後方自由口岸的西移；因之後方所能利用上海物資供給的，今後已沒有多大希望。</p>
<p>（二）在上海與自由區的貿易關係緊密時期，上海滙市的維持，直接上多少有利上海的物價，間接上　有平抑後方物價之效。因爲後方物價貴於上海物價的差額，如超過運輸上的一切加費，上海物資的移入勢必增大，後方物價的上漲，也就受到相當的束。上海對後方的物資交流關係，現在旣已减退，外加上海的物價因商品投機的亢進，正開始無覊束的上漲。因之與其在上海作無效果的穩定滙價與物價，以謀間接平抑後方的物價。還不如以此財力，直接用於安定後方的物價較有把握。因爲在後方，畢竟尙有政治權力可充物價政策的後盾。</p>
<p>（三）後方對於上海物資的取給，與上海物價的運用，雖已失其價値。但上海畢竟是中國的首富之區。上海市塲的維持不衰，於國家元氣的保存上究有貢獻。如果上海市塲因金融上的混亂而崩潰，則於戰後復興上，大有影響。加以於後方人心的穩定，國際上的聽聞，也不無關係。上海市塲穩定，上海的中立性也較易維持。然而這些都是非現實的，或僅是一種虛榮觀念而已。</p>
<p>繼續維持中國　損失比日本大</p>
<p>假使繼續維持而在中國無損，或因繼續維持而能發生對日經濟戰爭作用的話，那末也還値得。事實却又不然。繼續維持的塲台，日本果也不利，中國所受的損失，却大得多。</p>
<p>中國方面的不利，主要的有（一）每月耍負擔一筆平準金的損失，此項損失的資金，大部分等於在資助日本。（二）上海投機事業的發展，可吸引全國各地的資金移來，後方的資金也不能例外。（三）海市面旣有吸引各地資金來歸的魔力，於是就阻礙各地資金的投入後方。（四）日本旣能藉上海市塲而得推行其以戰養戰之策，此於戰爭本身，亦屬莫大不利。</p>
<p>至於日本方面的不利：（一）阻礙雜鈔的發展，亦即阻礙其利用雜鈔無限制搜刮中國物資的企圖。但事實上，他在淪陷區裹，儘可以武力爲此項企圖的後盾。所以雜鈔之能吾推進上海租界區？實屬無關宏旨。（二）上海市塲的穩定，在滬中外商人的團結，自易加强。此於上海中立性的維持上，當有幫助。上海中立性的增强，就是日本企圖自由控制租界的障礙。不過他之所以想控制租界，也不外乎想染指租界區內的物資而已。租界中立性保持，他對租界內物資之取給，雖須間接得之，但可以繼續享用。如中立性失　，則上海市塲崩潰，彼之所得取用者，將限於目前現有之存貨。故兩者相較，實際並無不利。</p>
<p>比較中日雙方對於上海滙市維持塲合之利害得失，無疑的日本有利較中國大，日本的不利較中國小。至於英美商人，利益更大。如果不維持中國雖仍能予以新的或更大的商業機會，但上海中立性的動搖，此於他們在滬權益及其投資，勢將全盤動搖。</p>
<p>如果放棄可以　想像到的後果</p>
<p>維持上的得失不等，與放棄後各方的利害關係，當然是反比例的。申言之：放棄的結果，中國的有利要比日本大，中國的不利却比日本小。試一思放棄後中日雙方將蒙何種影響可知：</p>
<p>如果平準會放棄維持上海的滙市，在中國方面果將蒙受下列三種不良影響：（一）上海法幣紛紛內流，使內地有通貨膨脹之虞。（二）有促成內地物資外流的可能。（三）有促成內地商品投機的危險。但中國不難以限制提存與禁止出口等非常手段防止，同時大可利用資金，以事建設，且因平準會從此可全力維持後方的進口需求，並利用政治上的權力以完成其滙兌上的嚴密統制，對於匯價與物價，反較易穩定。</p>
<p>但在日本方面，所蒙的不利影響，却就鉅大無比。（一）不易繼續取得第三國的軍需原材料之供給；（二）不易重定其日圓集團的匯兌秩序；（三）淪陷區裏的經濟秩序，將因上海市塲的混亂而同樣陷於不堪收拾的局面；（四）因法幣的逃亡與雜鈔的流出，物價將釀成無休止的狂漲，且反射其影響到日本木國。此時日本，勢必一面加强日圓集團內的物資交流關係，並設法使之調整；一面用暴力去控制一切存貨及生產機關，武力彈壓物價上漲。但一因物資供需情勢根本上的無法自給自足，外加對外貿易又無從繼續，終於走上消耗現存物資而達最後的枯竭之境。其間，社會的騷動，治安的失墜，黑交易的叢生，更屬必然的現象。</p>
<p>至於此時日本能不能在淪陷區裏樹立一種新貨幣，我的答復是：要發行，當然比現在容易。要成功，却比現在難得多。因爲現在可以把犧牲法幣的價格，用人爲抬高新鈔的手段。故淪陷區的物價，較易武斷的牽住。此其一。聯鈔而如無法幣暗盤及對滬匯兌，華北的物資恐慌勢必較現在尤烈。然而華各關，平時尙有出超的可能；華中華南，則一向入超。如果整個淪陷區對外貿易根本失常之後，新貨幣的計劃旣無法建立，就是現有的那些企圖，也耍無法維持。此其二。日本的出口是爲了進口，淪陷區的出口能力小而進口需要大，所以日圓集團的構成，拉東北，在日本是有利；拉華北，在日本也還多少有利，至於要把華中華南拉在一塊，非有法幣從中撮合對第三國的貿易，那就根本不利。</p>
<p>至於上海，當然更首當其衝。可以想像的情形是（一）金融界將極度混亂；（二）銀錢業將被迫停業；（三）雜鈔則乘機流出；（四）物價將瘋狂上漲；（五）商店將不願出售貨物而自動關門；（六）於是市民生計瀕絕，刦掠橫行，治安不保；（七）人口和資金，便同時逃散；（八）終於捲進日圓集團而共赴絕境。此時日人爲「調整本市物資供需」，勢必來一套「全盤調整勅令」。於是家倉變成公倉，要食用自己的囤糧，也得向日本當局申請「搬出證」。至於一般倉庫堆棧裏的存貨，那更不消說起。客氣點是以雜鈔按「官價」强制收買；不客氣呢，來一個沒收充公，同時再嚴申「囤藏者死」，以爲「膺懲」抗令者的伏筆。</p>
<p>總而言之：維持與放棄，在中日與其他各方面的利害得失是判然若揭的。現在中國當局的重申繼續維持，顯然是出上海於可能的水火，不是爲了中國或後方確有其必耍，或不得不然。</p>
<p>然而要使中國對於上海滙市的維持，不感厭惡，這就是上海的華人，外人連日本人，以及上海兩租界當局的事了。如果投機與放任投機，操縱與放任操縱，阻斷上海物資的止常流通，與提出不近情理的消耗品進口外滙的荒唐需要等等，那只是促成中團放棄的決心罷了。</p>

<p>— 益</p>
<p>最近上海女靑年會，發起募捐運動，結果募得十八萬五千餘元超過預定目標，的確是婦女界一件很光榮的事。</p>
<p>事實上，能彀給予人家一些幫助，是人生最快樂的事情，即使我們在寒天看見一頭受着凍餓的小貓而給它頓溫暖的餐食，也可以使我們中心有一種莫可名狀的安慰和愉快。</p>
<p>有許多人，一天到晚爲着自身的利益着想，這些人往往是沒有快樂的，反之，有些人能殼設法幫助人家，倒是終年非常愉快。</p>
<p>而且，有時候幫助人家，並不是一件很困難的事情，例如上海扶輪社正在徵集破舊的玩具，預備修理以後，在耶誕節送給貧苦的兒童，如果我們的孩子，有一二件玩具，正可以送給扶輪社，一則可以使幸福不如我們的孩子，也可以十享受一些歡樂，同時可以養成我們的孩子的同情心。</p>
<p>還有中華慈幼協會，現在徵慕難童敎養費，我們不妨從娛樂或其他方面節省一些錢，使被難的兒童，得到敎養。</p>
<p>在亞雨各德所著的小婦人」裏，有一段叙述喬賽菲的全家在聖誕的早晨，知道有一個貧苦的人家，一些東西都沒有吃，於是就把自己的食品去送給他們，這樣動人的故事，正可以在我們的家裏搬演起來。</p>
<p>報上近來登過不少關於救濟孤苦兒童的新聞，我想讀者諸君，一定會抱着「己飢己溺」的慈悲心理，總該加以援手吧。</p>

<p>夫婦之間，固然是可以無話不談的，然而必須言出由衷，決不可不負責任地發言，「少年維特之煩惱」的作者哥德，曾經有這麼一句話：「與女子不可戲言。」的確是至理名言，而且也是他的經騐之談，因爲他生平會經和不少的女子戀愛過。</p>
<p>在家庭裏，無論是言語行動，都應該忠誠坦白，決不可隨口胡說，有許多不幸的事故，在最初，無非是一種戲言而已。因爲這裏所說的戲言，等於是一種說慌。</p>
<p>同時，如果夫婦間能彀忠誠相待，無形中也可以給予兒童以良好的影饗，使他們在良好的環境中長成。</p>
<p>結婚實在是一種藝術，耍獲得結婚的快樂，先得看你努力的程度如何。</p>

<p>好多年前，有一個旅居美國美尼蘇達地方的瑞典人約翰生，在一個紡織廠要工作，家裏窮苦非常。某一天的晚上，他的太太要回到娘家去，因此他在家裏看管小孩。</p>
<p>那一天小孩吵得特別厲害，即使給他奶瓶，還是不能中止他的哭吵。等到他的太太回家，還是繼續着哭吵，結果原來是一隻針在小孩的身底下，孩子給刺痛，自然要不停的哭吵了。　「我來做一種安全的別針，使以後的小孩，不致再會被刺痛。」後來他果然做成了安全別針，他也因此致富了。</p>
<p>其實家庭中正有不少的事情，可以改良，一個對於家庭感覺興趣的丈夫，他不但可以享受家庭的幸福，也許還可以有意外的收穫呢。</p>

<p>— 頴卿</p>
<p>我是一個女人，是一個男人的妻子，同時亦是一個小孩的母親。</p>
<p>在四年前我與梀相識－他是一個文學士。因爲從小只有快樂包圍着我，這使我對於自然特別愛好，因此我亦運帶喜歡文學。所以我們在情投意合下結了婚，不久就有了一個孩子。這美麗幸福的生活，使我感覺得驕傲。在空閒的時候，我常常沉思着以爲我是世上最幸福的人！</p>
<p>但是，不成，老天似乎不允許在塵世上有個人生活在十全十美裏的環境裏！</p>
<p>一天，我與孩子在公園裏散步，突然我看見楝也在那裏，旁邊坐着一個美麗年靑的女子。他們似乎很親密。我稍近去看個淸楚，是的！這是他！我憤怒，我嫉忌，但立刻我想到旁邊的孩子，他的純潔的心靈是經不起那可怕的創傷。於是我忍耐着，壓制着自己，若無其事地帶他出了公園。</p>
<p>晚上他回來了，一切都沒有異樣，依舊像平常那樣的對我談笑。</p>
<p>我疑惑了，幾乎不相信我那次所見到的一切。終於一次我偷看他的日記：</p>
<p>「……萍對於我說了很多的話，表示她對我的欲望。她希望我能離開這窒息的孤島。她坦白地說明只有她才能造成我偉大的事業。我不能回答什麼，除了那感激的眼光……不！我不能離開梅，雖然這會使萍失望，難過。我要實踐我對梅的諾言，同時我當負責對梅一切的義務……我不願離開萍……我想做個超人，能看透生平的一切！」</p>
<p>在他的日記中大半都是這一類。</p>
<p>我明白了，爲了這我會暗暗地痛哭過。但我的驕傲又小許我將這事向任何人傾訴。當然在理智上我應爲他們的幸福而犧牲我自己，但情感却永不會使我這樣。我是一個弱者，假使我這樣做的話，那無疑是使自己滅亡。然而我總以爲我對於這世界有很大的留戀。</p>
<p>我現在壓低了我的驕傲，敬以萬分的誠意向我的姊妹兄弟們傾訴，希望大家給我一個美滿的解答。（酬稿費十元家庭月刊全年）</p>
<p>編者按　像頴卿女士處境的女子，數目很多，但頴卿女士是一個文學的愛好者，對於處理這件事，應該有更好的手腕。</p>
<p>我以爲對於頴卿女士丈夫的女友，應該加以考慮，看她能不能給他幸福，但即使可能，他們的關係，也只能止於純潔的友誼，可幸得很，這一點可以從他的日記中觀察出來，他是很明瞭的。</p>
<p>如果有機會，似乎不妨開誠地說明，但這並不是爭吵，也不是乞援，同時頴卿女士應該硏究自身的優點，（那幾點是丈夫所特殊愛好的，在目前曾吾對於那幾點疎懈過）爲了一個家庭的完整，爲了一個孩子的前途，爲自己，也爲了丈夫的一切，穎卿女士應該犧牲一切的傲慢與偏見，用全力把這件事有一個適當的處理。</p>

<h3 id="c70">僅僅是個笑話 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 無爲</p>
<p>最近看到一則笑話，是關於猶太人的，不用說，裏面又是牽涉到金錢。事情是這樣的：</p>
<p>猶太人和愛爾蘭人合夥做生意，他們深恐在陰間還是少不了孔方兄，於是相的後死者應在亡友的棺材裏，放下五百塊錢。</p>
<p>猶太人說：「我輸了，可憐的老友竟先我而逝哩。」</p>
<p>「那末你曾把五百塊錢放進他的棺材裏去麽？」</p>
<p>「唔…噢…爲什麼不呢？我把一張支票放了進去；還沒有來兌現呢。」</p>
<p>當然，世界上不一定會有這樣的事，可是世界上也不見得不會有這種笑話。</p>
<p>似乎對於猶太人太挖苦了罷？但是猶太人的得意之處，也正是在這種地方。再進一步說，這種舉動，更未始不是猶太人的「可愛」之處。</p>
<p>誰願意做不漂亮的事，誰又頗意做明吃虧的事。假定陰間眞要用銅鈿的話，有了五百元的一張支票，至少要比較身無半文的窮光棍要容易應付些罷。如果這所謂「另一世界」中，根本沒有幣制存在，那末即使帶了美金票——這幾天聽說一元美金可合法幣三十三四元－去，恐怕也未見得能解除困難罷。這些不過是廢話。</p>
<p>在一方面儘管表現得入情入理，大有涕泣而道之概，而另一方面却與自已絲毫無損，甚至還在暗暗好笑，這是上面所說的那個猶太人的作風。也就是他的勝利所在。</p>
<p>我們應該同情這個猶太人，佩服他的處世技巧；一面我們又不得不怪那個多事的愛爾蘭人，何必多此一舉！</p>
<p>然而世上或許眞有這種笑話呢。</p>
<h3 id="c71">無題 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>

<p>不知那一本雜誌上有這樣一個語言：「紐約哥倫比亞大學奧特金博士稱「假使男人不取消理髮的習慣，在五百六十餘年後，彼等將成「牛山濯濯」，婦人之髮更易脫落，以彼等平時理髪之故；因爲奧博十硏究頭髮脫落之原因有年，他相信頭皮須有相當重量以維持之，但因剪髮後此種必須之實量已减少，頭皮之力乃弱。故頭髮亦易脫落」。</p>
<p>此「可怖」之預言，在一般愛美的人聽起來，當然「恐慌莫名」但是我却最希望他提早兌現，因爲現在理髮一次動輒一二元，假使「兌現」後，豈不可省麽？人家饑笑禿頂；我却希望禿頂，欽佩禿頂；爲什麽？「心照不宣」！</p>
<h3 id="c72">對建議「乞丐市」的建議 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— 方堅頌</p>
<p>最近，有八爲了寒冬的快要來臨，而希望兩租界當局對露宿於街頭巷尾乞兒們，能設立廣大的收容塲所。一方面可使死亡的比率降低。同時，更可使界內的一般傅染病减少。尤其，社會秩序也可改進得多</p>
<p>這建議，我們是非常贊同的。</p>
<p>公共租界工部局總辦費利溥氏主張這事業是可以由工部局來辦理的，而且他也看得很淸楚——要是工部局能舉辦這件事，就一定能得到大衆的歡迎。我說，費氏看得一點不錯，的確，這已經是件急不容緩的事了。</p>
<p>至於乞丐市的設施，我們認爲部份工作，可由現在「收容所一中經過訓練的乞丐們自己來參加。只要經費有着落，就不妨馬上動手的。</p>
<p>關於裏面的設備，我們覺得有必須的幾點應該同「乞丐市」同時誕生的，那就是幾種不同的，簡單的工塲：織襪織毛巾，製肥皂，以及爲女乞丐可專設織繡檯布，手套等手工業，而尤其重要的，則是設立乞丐兒童的工讀學校，和業餘工人的補習夜校。這裏可特別注重敎他們怎樣倣人，和怎樣去認識社會。好像，這話是近乎高調」，但只要做的人有才幹，能同乞丐們共甘苦，共同生活，而不用上壓下的敎授方法，那末，我們相信，是絕對有成功的把握的。雖然，由於乞兒們的劣根性較深，但也不會個個如此的，在不同的程度中間，定然能够產生不少有用的人才。</p>
<p>因此，運帶的，我們發生了這樣的問題——乞丐市的管理問題。這裏，我們希望像美國的「兒童城」一樣，這市裏的市長，工程師，醫生，敎員，工人等等一切都由住在這市裏的兒童自己來擔任。當然，乞丐們一時是不可能的，但我們不妨定着這一個標的，那似乎是需要的。而現在開始時的管理員，也就應該和乞兒一樣的生活，而切忌高高在上的壓迫，而使他們起怨恨的心情，這點也該預爲防範的。</p>
<p>其次，醫院的設備，也是決不可缺的一件大事。</p>
<p>耍是這樣的乞丐市能舉辦，那末，不僅眼前的租界秩序可獲良好的進展，界內居民的健康可得史多保障，就是日後這批乞丐出來的時候，已經是大批有用的技術人才了，這一造福，才是非同小可的。</p>

<h3 id="c73">怎樣做中級從業員 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— 心安</p>
<p>中級從業員，處在上級與下級之間，討好了上級，給下級目爲走狗，討好了下級，又給上級認爲不忠。所以爲中級而要應付得面面俱到，皆大歡喜，便不能不注意下列各點了：</p>
<p>（一）膠台的工作－所謂膠合的工作，便是設法使上級與下級間精誠合作。本來上下級之間的隔閡，往往是由於中級人員的處理失宜或存心搗蛋，中級人而能存心做膠合工作，那其間的隔閡不難泯除。例如在上級面前，常常講些下級對他信仰的話，使上級對於他的部下發生好感，從而產生體諒與信任的意念：同時在下級面前，也常常講些上級對於他們贊賞的話，使他們對於上級忠誠貼從，凡有差遣，便能悉力以赴之了。萬一上級的舉止有些乖張張；做中級的便須在下級面前，找出一個能使下級滿意或能促使下級諒解的理由來，極力爲上級辯護，使下級對於上級，勿失信心，勿生裂痕；同時更以迂迴側擊的方法，使上級在維持體面下把乖張的地方改了過來，所謂一爾有嘉謨嘉猷，入則告爾后於內，爾乃順之於外曰；斯謨斯猷，惟吾后之德。」這可是使上級們維持體面下改正乖張舉動的好方式。</p>
<p>（二）調劑的工作－工作有繁有簡，業務有忙有閒，上級對於這些，容或未能明瞭。做中級的在這種塲合，便須把他們的工作設法加以調劑，例如在工作緊張的時候，忙得不得開交，做中級的便可替他們分別緩急，把急的先辦，緩的待急的辦了後再辦，或甚至把它支配在工作空閒的時間。如今天某甲忙着，某乙空着，便請某乙去幫某甲；明天某乙忙着某甲空着，也可以請某甲去幫某乙；總使下級對工作，感覺得勝任愉快。這樣，事無積壓貽誤，人無勞逸不均，上級與下級，皆大歡喜。</p>
<p>此外，求得忠誠的部下，使工作效率增加，也是中級人員的重要工作。下面的一個故事，便是求得忠誠部下的絕好例子：某年，美國紐約鐵路局管轄下的某段鐵路出了毛病，以致火車險些兒闖禍；這件事被上級知這了，認爲是二位工程師的過失，立刻命令鐵路局的總理克勞利先生把這二位工程師撤職。當克氏接到了這命令以後，他認爲這二位工程師過往的成績不差，如能挽救把他們被撤的頹遝，或者能使他們工作更努力些。於是他便很誠懇的向上級爲這二位工程師請求寬恕。結果上級被他的話感動了，立刻收回成命。這消息傳到了二位工程師那裏，他們感動得幾乎說不出話來，從此便成了克氏最忠實的助手。像克氏那樣，眞可說是善做中級從業員的了。</p>

<p>「當然，你現在是不能再唱衫子的了！」他重復取起那支雪茄烟來呼了幾口。「不過你畢竟是科班出身，大概要唱老生，老旦，或是小花臉總不成問題吧？」</p>
<p>一老生老旦還行！小花臉就不成，因爲我這個人一生就不會開玩笑！一說着，秋海棠忍不住又把自己頷下所留的約摸寸許長的短鬚撫摸了一下。一可惜我的年紀已大了一些，不然充個二路武生也還對付得了！記得咱們在班子裏的時候，我二哥趙玉崑是武功最好的一個，他瞧我身子太瘦弱，便天天逼着我一起練功，所以後來逢到唱反巾戲的日子，我也漏過幾次四杰村，花蝴蝶這一類短打戲。長……」</p>
<p>「行啦！」錢先生不等他把話說完，便馬上拉着他一起往外走去。一你有這三行可以對付便沒有問題了。此刻在紅舞台當後台經理的蕭吉淸也是我多年的朋友，讓我先帶你去見見他，不管是掃　老生也好，二路武生也好，暫時且唱幾個月，慢慢兒大家再想方法。」</p>
<p>對於這位先生的然心援助，秋海棠自然是感激涕零的；而對於他說的「便沒有問題了」的一句話，也覺得很對。（二四六）</p>

<h3 id="e4">Chongqing Citizens Take Note: Hong Kong Monetary Conference <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>After Fluctuations in the Black Market Exchange Rate Between Shanghai and Hong Kong, Rising Prices in the Mainland Further Increase the Burden on the Common People</p>
<p>Chongqing – At a time when the Sino-Japanese war is quiet, the attention of the Chinese people is focused on the upcoming Hong Kong monetary conference. Although the US-Japan negotiations and the progress of the Soviet-German war are still valued by the Chinese people, who believe that they will directly affect the outcome of the Sino-Japanese war, they are naturally more concerned about their own economic problems. It was previously heard here that the United States had abandoned Vladivostok as a supply route to the Soviet Union. Because the meaning of this decision was unknown—whether it was appeasement of Japan by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, or whether the three countries were merely making necessary adjustments to cope with a possible war in the Pacific—it caused considerable concern for a time. However, since President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull made statements on this matter, people's hearts have been greatly comforted, and they all believe that this decision is at least not any effort to appease Japan. The economic situation of Free China, as a result of rising prices, has increased the hardship of the lives of ordinary people, which has aroused widespread concern. It is feared that before the recent sharp drop in the value of legal tender in the Shanghai and Hong Kong black markets, prices had gradually risen, completely exceeding the rate of increase in salaries and wages. The government has indeed made the greatest efforts to stabilize rice prices and sell rice to civil servants at an official price of 235 yuan per stone, but ordinary people still have to pay a price of 315 yuan per stone when buying it in the market. Moreover, only the price of rice is regulated, which cannot completely solve the problem of living expenses. There is still no way to cope with the continued rise in the prices of rent, fuel, groceries, vegetables, salt, sugar, and other daily necessities. Although civil servants have sufficient rice, they still feel unable to pay for other expenses, especially for clothing, infant food, and children's education. There are now many second-hand stores standing, and civil servants are selling old clothes and shoes to cope with current needs. However, the supply of old items is sometimes exhausted, and soon there will be nothing left to sell. At present, there are very few new hats, shoes, or clothes to be seen on the market in Chongqing, and most people wear running shoes with old car tires as soles. Moreover, due to the high prices of vegetables and meat, most people feel undernourished. Since the recent sharp drop in the value of legal tender in the Shanghai and Hong Kong black markets, the situation has become more critical than before. Within a week, the price of a pack of ten "Hong Xibao" cigarettes has risen from 1.7 yuan to 4.5 yuan, so many people have had to switch to smoking Sichuan-made cigars. (Reuters report, 26th)</p>

<p>Chen Lifu Reports on Two Objectives; Members Prepare to Return</p>
<p>Guiyang – The Institute of Engineers held two meetings at its 10th annual meeting to discuss Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Industrial Plan. The following two resolutions were reached: (1) Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Industrial Plan is actually a national defense plan, so it should closely cooperate with the current national defense plan. (2) Continue to devote efforts to the research of the cost estimates, but the drafter should divide the entire plan into several sections, each section can be divided into nine years, and stipulate the greater importance of each section of the plan. According to Mr. Chen Lifu, President of the Research Association, the conclusions made in this discussion stated that we should propose two objectives for studying this plan: (1) To enable us to obtain a concrete image of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Industrial Plan and to instill this image into the minds of the people and young people so that they can truly recognize how vast and urgent the manpower and material resources our country will need in the future and strive to encourage each other. (2) To enable us to have a numerical determination of the Industrial Plan in order to carry out the methods of coordination in all aspects, so its significance is self-evident. Although the Research Association has only been established for a short time, it is impossible not to thank the sincerity of the members for their cooperation in being able to submit a general report today. The valuable opinions put forward by the members in the two discussions at this annual meeting have benefited the Research Association a lot. However, due to the vastness of the plan and the short time for the two discussions, it is difficult to obtain perfect results. Therefore, it is hoped that the members can continue to contribute their opinions after the end of the discussion meeting. The annual meeting designated Gu Yuxuan and other five people to draft a report to be submitted to the central government regarding the process of this discussion, and requested the government to cultivate a large number of technical talents and start some construction projects. As for the members, apart from a part of them going to Huangguoshu Waterfall to visit the Great Falls on the 26th, the rest are preparing to return. (Telegraph of the 26th)</p>

President Roosevelt rebuked those who attempted to "lead us into a false sense of security... when the great military power of aggression is rampant, when the aggressor is riding over the continent, we recognize that they are seeking to ultimately destroy our freedom, rights, happiness, and the things supported by our country's government. Our foreign policy cannot remain conservative." President Roosevelt said, "The American people are not easily fooled. They are smart and realistic, and they do not fear anyone. Free people with freedom of speech choose for themselves. We gradually reached a solemn decision, but when they make a decision, they have the support of 130 million free American people, the unwavering, true, and inevitable purpose, the destruction of the Hitler threat. In order to achieve this purpose, our responsibility is fully as great as those who die fighting for this purpose. I know that our country will not evade this responsibility, nor will it shrink from any necessary sacrifice."</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Says Determined to Retaliate for Nazi Crimes; Tagore Mourns Murdered Hostages</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington telegram on the 26th. On Saturday, the White House issued an article that did not explain its purpose or mention any particular country, only the German slaughter of innocent hostages. It said that recently, in the Nazi iron hoof, there were occasional attacks on Germans in the country, and the Germans immediately shot dozens of innocent hostages to show retaliation. This kind of behavior shocked the world, which has already suffered pain and cruelty. Civilized countries have long established the basic principle that A should not suffer for B, but the Nazi thugs massacred hundreds or fifty innocent people because they could not arrest the attackers. All those who want to cooperate with Hitler or appease Hitler should know the warning. The Nazi thugs should have learned from the war and know that terrorism cannot crush the spirit of mankind. Why are they now developing their living space and new order with unprecedented acts of terrorism? It should be known that terrorism can never promote peace in Europe, only sow the seeds of terrible revenge in the future.</p>
<p>Reuters, London telegram on the 26th. British Prime Minister Churchill issued an article expressing the British government's feelings about the German massacre of hostages in France and praised President Roosevelt's condemnation. Churchill's article was more direct than that issued by the American president, saying that the massacres in France are just one example of what Hitler's thugs have done in Poland, Belgium, Yugoslavia, Norway, the Netherlands, and the German rear in the Soviet Union. This is also a precursor to what Hitler will impose on the people of Britain and the United States when he gains power in the future. We must make retaliation for such crimes one of the main purposes of this war.</p>

<p>Since the armistice, the course of all events in France has been entirely dominated by the psychological impact of this misjudgment, and it remains so to this day. Those in power in Vichy are not only the inheritors of defeat—which makes their situation exceptionally difficult—but also the inheritors of their miscalculations. Although the majority of French public opinion hopes for a British victory, the words and actions of French leaders still hold to the belief that German victory is merely a temporary development. People like Laval are preparing to help Germany win. As for Marshal Pétain and others, they are sensitive to public opinion and would not completely ignore it, so they want to take the path of neutrality, as Belgium and the Netherlands did before their fall. This explains the two contradictory phenomena in Vichy.</p>
<p>Some French people think that this is a very clever and flexible approach. They say that the French should prioritize their own interests. British victory may be more beneficial to us, but we cannot rely on it too much. We must be realists. If Hitler wins, we must embrace the new continental order. This is our only chance to continue to exist.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, this view is very similar to the views of the so-called "appeasers" in the United States. Appeasers believe that Hitler rules the world outside the Americas, and that the United States and Hitler can still reach some kind of compromise.</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, they inevitably fail to consider the essence of Nazism in this theory. It may be easy to understand why American appeasers intend to mitigate the danger. The United States is so powerful and separated from Europe by thousands of miles of ocean. It is truly inconceivable that German troops would occupy New York, Washington, Boston, and Chicago. But it is truly insane that the leaders of France and many ordinary French people still cannot understand the true meaning of so-called German rule.</p>
<p>I admit that I cannot fully explain this, and I am also confused by the attitude of some compatriots towards the central issue of France's existence under German control. I know that there are some people in France who have been trying to oppose the democratic system for many years. They see France's defeat as an opportunity to restore France to what they call its destined position. True fascists, monarchists, and ordinary reactionaries are uniting to erase the principles established in 1789 and the social happiness gained over the past 150 years. They say that democracy, parliamentary system, and liberalism may be beneficial to the Anglo-Saxon nation. But they are not French. What France has always needed and often returned to is a kind of personal power, with a monarch, emperor, or consul as the ruling representative. The Consulate system of 1795 was how Napoleon rose to power.</p>
<p>Although I personally do not hold this view at all, I am willing to admit that this idea is quite debatable, and it can be debated as a purely French issue, especially because the war was lost in the hands of the Third Republic, and the anti-democratic atmosphere is strong, so it needs to be debated even more. Unfortunately, France, like other countries, is involved in a war whose importance far outweighs the political system that France should adopt now or in the future. The real conflict is not between French democracy and dictatorship, but between the fundamental destruction of Nazi rule and the continued maintenance of Western culture. This war is global. No matter how tragic it is that France is no longer able to resist Nazism, no matter how important the continued war between Britain and Germany is, they are only episodes in this struggle. The real question is: will Nazism, which is completely devoid of morality and spiritual content and can therefore only destroy the world through war and revolution, eventually engulf the last piece of pure land left in the Western Hemisphere? Or: will our vibrant, creative Western Hemisphere succeed in resisting the nihilism of the East?</p>

<h3 id="e28">Japanese Army Eyes the Yunnan-Burma Road <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>After the temporary cessation of the two battles in northern Hunan and western Hubei, will the Japanese army launch another large-scale offensive in the near future? Judging from the precedents of the past year or two, because of insufficient troop resources and the time required for deployment, after a relatively large-scale battle, the Japanese army always needs a considerable period of rest before engaging in another offensive, especially when the outcome of that battle is a defeat. However, the current situation is complex and cannot be judged solely on the basis of past experience. If we assume that the Japanese army is unable to launch another major offensive simply because it has just suffered losses in Hunan and Hubei, it would be completely wrong.</p>
<p>Currently, Japan is eager to advance north and south, and its interest in China may be less than in the past. However, "resolving the China Incident" is the most important and pressing task in the minds of successive Japanese authorities. Because it is impossible to withdraw from the Chinese battlefield in a hurry, its southward and northward advances can only be carried out in a speculative and opportunistic manner without daring to act rashly. Therefore, when its southward and northward advances are still waiting—waiting for an opportune moment—it is not unexpected that it will temporarily refocus its attention on China. Moreover, at a time when American aid to China is unprecedentedly active, if Japan is not prepared to directly break with the United States immediately, it must at least strike at the United States' allies in the Far East. In his policy speech after taking office, Tojo first mentioned "seeking a victorious resolution to the China Incident." Of course, it is impossible to know what aspirations and confidence Tojo has in this regard, but the suggestion by American reporter Sehn that the Japanese army will attack the Yunnan-Burma Road from Vietnam is highly credible.</p>
<p>In the minds of most Japanese people, regarding the war against China, they attach more importance to cutting off China's foreign aid than to occupying China's rear hinterland. They have always held a prejudice, blaming the reason for being unable to defeat China on third countries, and emphasizing the importance of foreign aid over China's inherent national potential. Therefore, since the war entered its second phase, the Japanese have paid far less attention to how to conquer China's rear than to cutting off China's foreign aid. Of course, for the reason of avoiding the difficult and choosing the easy, since the latter is easier to accomplish, it is undeniable that they have devoted more effort to the latter over the past two or three years. In fact, from the beginning of the war, the Japanese announced a blockade of the Chinese coast, and later successively occupied Guangzhou, Shantou, Qinfang, and even Haiphong and Hanoi, important sea routes in Vietnam, as well as the coastal ports of Fujian and Zhejiang. The only remaining routes are the Gansu-Xinjiang Highway leading northwest to the Soviet border and the Yunnan-Burma Road in the southwest. Their transport capacity is far less than that of some of the seaports, rivers, and railways that have fallen into enemy hands. However, China's resistance has not weakened at all, which shows that foreign aid is only a secondary factor in China's war of resistance against Japan.</p>
<p>In the negotiations between Japan and the United States and the Soviet Union, they almost always demanded that aid to China be stopped, but the firm stance of the United States and the Soviet Union has never wavered. Since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the Soviet Union itself has needed to rely on Britain and the United States for war materials, so it is not surprising that its supply to China has decreased. However, American aid to China has been increasing day by day, although it may not have reached the level of war materials supplied to Britain and the Soviet Union. It has already reached an unprecedented level. Therefore, in the intermittent negotiations between the United States and Japan, the issue of aid to China is an important point of contention between the two sides, but it is definitely not something that can be compromised through negotiations. Therefore, as relations between the United States and Japan gradually become strained, Japan's direct action, attempting to cut off the only route for American war materials to China, is not only possible, but also considered necessary by the Japanese authorities.</p>
<p>A year ago, after the Japanese army entered northern Vietnam, it intended to seize the opportunity to invade Yunnan. However, although it is only 300 kilometers from the Vietnamese border to Yunnan, the mountains and rivers are treacherous, and only the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is passable. At that time, China immediately implemented a border blockade, dismantled the railway, and stationed a large army to stand guard, preparing for any eventuality. It would not be easy for the Japanese army to invade. Therefore, they also knew that it was difficult and stopped. This time, the Japanese army in Vietnam is reportedly still concentrated in Haiphong and Lao Cai, which shows that they are still focusing on the Yunnan-Vietnam Road. Therefore, the difficulties they face will still be the same as in the past. If China can strengthen its defenses, it can be safe. As for the possibility of invading Yunnan from Guizhou along the You River, it is no longer possible after the recovery of Nanning. On the other hand, if Japan is not willing to immediately clash with Britain and the United States, it may not directly invade Burma from northern Vietnam.</p>
<p>However, no matter how the Japanese army invades, the world should recognize the great significance of the move to attack the Yunnan-Burma Road. In the Soviet Union, after the United States stopped using Vladivostok, there are still the Persian Gulf and Yarkand Zil that can be used. However, between free China and Britain and the United States, there is only the Yunnan-Burma Road. The threat to the Yunnan-Burma Road is certainly not beneficial to China, but judging from the experience of the three-month blockade last autumn, it is far from enough to cause a fatal blow to China. However, the united front of ABCD in the Far East will be greatly affected, because the Yunnan-Burma Road today is no different from a symbol and passage of this cooperation. The Japanese army's preparation to attack the road, although ostensibly to cut off China's lifeline, is actually intended to dismantle the connection of this united front, making it separate and isolated, so that it will be easier to defeat them one by one later.</p>
<p>Faced with this highly likely Japanese offensive, it is expected that China will fully fulfill its dual task of defending itself and the Far East. After U.S. Navy Secretary Knox made a series of tough speeches about the Far East, there was news that the U.S. Asiatic Fleet had arrived in Singapore, which shows that Britain and the United States are also stepping up their defenses. As for the development of the overall situation in the future, it will depend entirely on what choice Japan itself makes.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Southern Front Battles Tighten, Moscow Announces Martial Law <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Battles Most Intense in the Don River Basin, German Forces Suffer Losses on the Kalinin Front</p>
<p>United Press, Kuibyshev, 26th</p>
<p>It has just been received here from the front that Moscow announced martial law yesterday, while the formidable German land and air forces on the southern front have launched an offensive against Crimea and intensified pressure on Rostov and Kharkov. Lieutenant General Ademyev wrote in Pravda that Moscow and its surrounding areas have declared martial law. According to various telegrams, Hitler's attempt to reach Moscow in the Mozhaisk area has not succeeded after three days. Also, battles are raging along the entire line from the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea, and Soviet forces in the Leningrad area have taken the initiative. The German offensives against Rostov, Kharkov, and the Donets Basin are considered the most dangerous by the telegrams (note that a Berlin telegram yesterday claimed that Germany had occupied Kharkov). Various telegrams also state that German air attacks on Moscow are also gradually intensifying, and German fighter planes are also making their first appearance as escort bombers over the Soviet capital. Also, Leningrad Radio claimed that the Baltic Fleet has destroyed more than 50 German warships, nearly 20 transport ships, and more than 400 aircraft. Moscow Radio said that the fighting in the Crimean provincial capital is particularly fierce, especially in Kharkov.</p>
<p>Havas, Moscow, 26th Pravda reported today that the situation on the Moscow front for the Red Army has deteriorated again. Although two enemy attacks last night and this morning were repelled, the German army broke through a certain defense line in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th</p>
<p>There is no sign of any relaxation of military activity on any part of the Soviet front, and the Donets River Basin remains the area of the most intense fighting. The Soviet midnight communiqué specifically mentioned the fighting in several areas including Mozhaisk, Maloyaroslavets, Novgorod, and Makiivka. A Reuters dispatch from Moscow said that Soviet forces are now putting up stronger resistance on the Donets River front. The fighting is most intense near the Donets Stalin and Makiivka, about 100 miles southeast of Moscow. According to the Soviet News Agency, Hitler is using his elite troops in the area, launching offensives, but they have been repelled. The fighting in Crimea remains fierce, with the enemy attacking repeatedly, but all have failed. Soviet forces are carrying out counter-attacks in the area and in Mozhaisk, 65 miles from Moscow, retaking some lost ground. Soviet forces on the Kalinin front inflicted heavy losses on the enemy, with nearly 4,000 German soldiers killed or wounded. Soviet forces captured a lot of spoils. According to radio reports, the two sides on the road south to Moscow are less than 60 meters apart. German troops dig trenches to confront each other, within range of Soviet artillery fire. At night, the German army launches rockets to inspect the positions, and Soviet reconnaissance teams break into German lines. According to their rear, the German claim that they have captured Kharkov, an important industrial city in central Ukraine, has not been confirmed by the Soviet Union or the Allied countries, but the Germans have released details of the capture of the city. The Associated Press reported that the arrival of winter has affected the morale of the German army. It is said that many German soldiers are still wearing summer uniforms. According to German prisoners, the German command ordered them to show initiative, in other words, to plunder civilians for winter clothes. The intensity of the fighting around Moscow can be seen in the Soviet supplementary communiqué. According to the communiqué, a Soviet tank unit fighting near Orel annihilated two German infantry battalions in a few days, destroying 133 enemy tanks, 35 flat-firing guns, and several mortars and motor bicycles, as well as 15 tow trucks. On Friday, a Soviet air force unit destroyed 47 German tanks, 160 ammunition trucks, and annihilated two battalions of German infantry. Soviet guerrillas continue to operate in the Odessa region. A few days ago, a guerrilla unit, carrying machine guns and automatic guns, attacked a Romanian camp at night. The Romanian soldiers were caught off guard and fled in panic. Sixty Romanians were killed and fifty wounded by Soviet cavalry.</p>
<p>German Offensive on Rostov Fails</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th Today, the Soviet-German war has entered its 19th week. The Soviet Union is now repelling the increasing threat from the German army on the Moscow front and is trying to prevent the German army from entering the rich industrial area in the Donets River Basin. Today, all sources said that although the German army launched fierce attacks by land and air, they have so far failed to break through the outer defenses of Moscow. On the Donets River Basin front, although the Soviet Union resisted bravely, the German army finally made some progress by virtue of its superiority in numbers and firepower. Moscow Radio solemnly declared that although Rostov is facing a serious threat, the German army's intensive offensive has not succeeded so far.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th Although the German announcement that they have occupied Biancoff has not been acknowledged by the Soviet Union, it indicates that the important industrial area of the Donets River Basin is feeling a new threat. German General Kleist's troops have turned north from Taganrog, passing through Makiivka to the middle of the Donets River. The German offensive against Kharkov has become a threat to the north. The real danger in the European part of the Soviet Union lies in the German offensive against the Caucasus and the industrial areas of the Don and Donets River basins. This is why General Timoshenko was transferred to the command of the southern front, and Generals Vorobev and Budyonny were tasked with organizing new troops. After the German army renewed its offensive against Crimea, it seemed to add a large number of mechanized units to the reserve of the Ukrainian war, in order to defeat the Soviet army on the southern front to the other side of the Volga River. Although the warmer climate in the south gave the German army the opportunity to extend the autumn offensive, it should be noted that although Soviet manpower, materials, and reserves have suffered losses, the entire Soviet army is still fighting under orderly and unified command. The German army can only eliminate this army to avoid falling into difficulties in the coming winter. It is useless to attack Ingermanland, Leningrad, or Crimea.</p>
<p>Many German Tanks, Red Army Fights Hard</p>
<p>TASS, Kuibyshev, 26th The exact number of German deaths and tanks destroyed near Moscow will be tallied later. What is currently known is that the number of tanks the Germans have is very large, and they are making the most of this point. They are attacking our defenses with tanks along the entire line. It takes great courage and composure to defeat these armored giants. Rokossovsky's troops destroyed 60 enemy tanks. When several cannons and artillerymen were repelling a tank attack under heavy fire, they were crushed to death by enemy machinery. Soldiers under Govorov captured flat-firing guns, motor bicycles, munitions, and important staff documents when they counter-attacked and drove the Germans out of a certain area. Sergeant Goodlai's machine gun killed dozens of fascist soldiers. The morale of our army is high. Whenever a rifle is destroyed, they angrily smash the enemy's head with a steel bar, crushing it. Our signalmen are working heroically. Junior Sergeant Solandyatev's team was ordered to repair a damaged telephone line. When there were still 15 to 20 feet of wire to be repaired, enemy planes suddenly appeared and opened fire on the signalmen with machine guns, but the signalmen were determined and continued to work. Soldatyev and one soldier, Panchik, were injured, but they did not return until the work was completed. Our motorized regiment launched a sudden counter-attack and recovered two villages. In this decisive battle, the enemy suffered heavy losses. Our soldiers captured 80 motor bicycles, more than 300 bicycles, five flat-firing guns, ten machine guns, countless rifles, and a large number of war materials. One hundred and fifty captured Red Army soldiers were also released. Although the weather is not suitable for flying, Romanov's squadron and Junior Lieutenant Fryubov's squadron suddenly attacked enemy tank units and infantry units within the anti-aircraft fire line. On that day, they destroyed about 30 tanks and 20 trucks carrying infantry and oil.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 26th The Exchange Telegraph Agency reported yesterday that Vichy Radio stated that Hitler's Nazi troops are only 20 miles from Moscow.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Foreign Secretary Eden Announces Iran Accepts in Principle Allies with Britain and the Soviet Union <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Britain's Position in the Middle East Greatly Enhanced, Supplies to Soviet Union Delivered Monthly</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th British Foreign Secretary Eden said in a speech in Manchester yesterday that British losses in Persia were less than 100. The Iranian government has accepted in principle the proposal to ally with Britain and the Soviet Union. He hopes that the establishment of this alliance can be announced. This alliance will further guarantee the stability of Iran, because the stability of Iran is extremely beneficial to Britain and the Soviet Union. The line from the Caucasus through Persia, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, and Egypt to the Sahara Desert has now become a continuous line of Allied forces. Troops and supplies have been transported along this line continuously throughout the summer, not only from Britain, but also from India and other parts of the British Empire and the United States. Britain's position in the Middle East has greatly increased in the past year. We are now building up reserves to meet any challenge. He was unable to say where and when Britain could launch an attack. The War Cabinet must be responsible for considering all decisions and actions. We do not want to take action to win popular support. We must only take action where it is worth the risk. This war is a long-term matter, not something that can be resolved by a sudden improvement in the short term. Some people say that the Prime Minister's actions are weak. This is laughable.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th British Navy Secretary Alexander said last night that Britain has sent some naval equipment to the Soviet Union and has attacked enemy transport ships carrying reinforcements to the Soviet Union 14 times. All the items requested by the Soviet Union at the Moscow Conference have been agreed to be shipped in monthly installments. All the items that should have been delivered in October have been delivered.</p>

<p>Havas, Iranian Capital, 25th According to reliable sources, most of the Soviet troops stationed in northern Iran will be withdrawn and transferred to the Caucasus to strengthen defenses. All tanks and armored vehicles have begun to move towards the Soviet-Iranian border. Afterwards, the Soviet Union will only leave a small number of motorized units stationed in Iran.</p>

<h3 id="e32">New Supplementary Regulations for Managing Prices Approved by Consular Body <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Expected to Be Implemented Within the Week; Public Sales for Items Like Cooking Oil and Coal May Begin</p>
<p>Reliable sources recently indicated that the Consular Body in this port, after careful consideration of the new supplementary regulations for price management submitted by the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) last week, has been consulting with their respective embassies or governments, given the implications for treaty interests in China. As a result, the Consular Body is expected to hold a special meeting to make a final decision, approving the new supplementary regulations proposed by the SMC with or without reservations within the week, thereby granting the SMC the necessary authority to control the prices of goods within the Settlement.</p>
<p>Rigorous Management Methods Stressed</p>
<p>An SMC official stated that the SMC has unlimited expectations of the Consular Body and urges the approval of the proposed new supplementary regulations. The SMC is fully prepared both in execution and in law and only requires the Consular Body's approval to quickly formulate concrete measures and begin implementation. Initially, the scope will not be too broad, but the management methods will be as rigorous as possible to achieve complete success. It is believed that after the Consular Body approves the new supplementary regulations, the SMC will convene a special council meeting to devise countermeasures.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Supplementary Regulation Contents</p>
<p>As for the content of the new supplementary regulations, although the SMC has not yet formally announced them, reliable sources suggest that they include: (1) items subject to price management (such as essential goods like wheat and flour); (2) the establishment of maximum prices, ensuring legitimate profits for merchants; and (3) penalties for violating the regulations: (a) for Chinese violators, business licenses will be revoked, and the cases will be transferred to the courts for sentencing; (b) for people from countries enjoying extraterritorial rights, business licenses will be revoked, and the cases will be transferred to their respective Consulates or consular courts for sentencing.</p>
<p>Public Sales Planned for Cooking Oil and Coal</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language *Mainichi Shinpo*, the SMC, in order to stabilize prices and study further measures, convened a price stabilization meeting with importers on the 23rd. As a result, it is planned to expand upon the previously decided plan to directly purchase flour, including the purchase of cooking oil and coal in the plan. It is reported that the SMC is currently planning to explain the current situation in Shanghai to Mr. Kirkland, the US economic representative arriving in Shanghai on the 25th, and to request that Mr. Kirkland mediate to obtain foreign exchange. If this plan can be realized in the future, rice, flour, cooking oil, and coal will all be sold publicly, and a public fixed-price system will be implemented for other major daily necessities, which may achieve considerable results in stabilizing prices.</p>
<p>British Merchants Decide to Prevent Hoarding</p>
<p>At a regular meeting of the British Residents Association of Shanghai on the 21st, sincere support was expressed for the SMC's measures to suppress prices. This reporter has also learned from related parties that British importers and British factories believe that the main reason for the disorderly prices in the city is that general brokers purchase raw materials from importers but do not sell them to factories, instead hoarding them, causing a serious phenomenon of factories lacking raw materials and stopping work. Another reason is that brokers and vendors, after obtaining goods from factories, do not sell them to retail stores, but also hoard them, causing some factories to reduce production under the panic of raw materials, unable to cope with the demands of these hoarding speculators. As a result, general retailers cannot purchase products from factories and turn to hoarding households for purchases, causing prices to rise higher and higher, creating the current serious situation. In view of this, general British importing merchants have decided that in the future, raw materials for factory use will only be sold directly to factories and no longer to brokers or vendors, so that factories can maintain their production and not be manipulated by hoarders. The products of each factory will also be prohibited from being sold to brokers and vendors and will be directly distributed to retail stores to stabilize prices. The factories belonging to British firm Jardine Matheson, the sulfuric acid plant belonging to Gibb Livingston &amp; Co., and the Peiping Woollen Factory have all implemented this method. Other British factories also plan to continue to implement it.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Large Quantities of Gasoline Soon to Arrive in Shanghai - Over Five Million Gallons <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language *Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun*, gasoline in Shanghai has become scarce because general oil merchants are making false claims of insufficient reserves to profit from backroom deals, resulting in a break of all previous records. Recently, companies such as Asiatic Petroleum and Texaco have been actively adopting countermeasures. It is reported that by the end of this month and the beginning of next month, a large quantity of gasoline of more than five million gallons will be shipped in by the three major gasoline companies. At that time, the backroom prices and other undesirable phenomena should be swept away. According to Mr. Fujita Shigeru, the head of the general affairs department of Asiatic Petroleum, the recent soaring of gasoline backroom prices is really inexplicable. Although a large quantity of gasoline will arrive at the end of this month and the beginning of next month, the backroom prices will definitely fall at that time. If backroom deals are still found in the future, we will definitely find ways to sanction them and hope that all parties will work hard to assist.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Post-War Postal Deficit Reaches 70 Million <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Loses Over One Million Per Month; Postage Increase Inevitable</p>
<p>The exhaustion of the entire postal economy has recently reached its peak. If there were no state-owned banks to provide overdrafts to maintain it, it would have tended towards collapse and shutdown. The above was said by a senior official of the Shanghai Postal Administration to a Ta Tung News Agency reporter who visited.</p>
<p>Soaring Freight Costs</p>
<p>According to him, since the start of the war, transportation has been mostly blocked, postal routes have been congested, and the parcel business, on which the post office relies as a major source of income, has almost completely stagnated. The number of other postal transport costs is also huge, but its efficiency is reduced by half. Due to many reasons, postal revenue has decreased sharply, while the transportation costs consumed have increased instead.</p>
<p>National Losses</p>
<p>It is estimated that the total economic losses of the national postal service in the four years after the war will be between 50 million and 70 million yuan. This number is very alarming. Even in terms of postal services in the Shanghai area, the monthly loss is over one million yuan. Fortunately, this deficit can be overdrawn from the national bank, otherwise, the entire postal system would have stagnated long ago, and the postal economy would have collapsed long ago.</p>
<p>Price Increase Necessary</p>
<p>The official also said that the issue of domestic postage increases is considered very necessary. The postage increase has been implemented since 1932, and only last year was it increased again, and the amount increased was less than 60%. But the other expenditures of the post office, such as transportation, printing, paper, and the salaries of postal employees, have increased more than tenfold. Since the increase in expenditures is like this, and the increase in income is like that, this kind of difference cannot be compensated, so when the postal business declines sharply, it will only add to the difficulties. However, this matter is still under review by the Executive Yuan, and the Shanghai Bureau has not heard anything about the date of implementation and the amount of the increase. He concluded that the doubling of foreign postage has been set to be implemented on the first of next month.</p>

<p>Beginning Today, He Will Meet with People in the Banking Industry</p>
<p>Mr. Kirkland, the financial expert specially sent by the United States to China to help solve the problems of legal tender and foreign exchange, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, he went to the US Consulate General to hold talks with officials. It is reported that starting today, he will meet with various people in the related banking industry to collect the most urgent information on Shanghai's financial trade.</p>
<p>Returning to Hong Kong Soon to Attend a Meeting</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language *Mainichi Shinpo*, Fox, Herbach, and Gu Yiqun, who arrived in Hong Kong on the 23rd, began to exchange opinions with the Exchange Stabilization Fund and the financial circles of Hong Kong on the 24th. It is reported that the formal financial meeting will have to wait until Mr. Kirkland, the US economic representative currently inspecting Shanghai, returns to Hong Kong before it can be held. At that time, Nieh Meiya will also fly from Chongqing to Hong Kong to participate. Everyone is paying close attention to the outcome of this meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Ten-End-of-Month Deadline Approaching; New Loans to be Released <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The ten-end-of-month deadline for Shanghai's industry and commerce is approaching. Factories, companies, and firms have made large-scale overall decisions on all deposits and loans that should be returned. For old customers with good credit, various banks have transferred accounts, and the amount collected is very limited. Most of the new loans are for domestic product factories, about 15 million yuan, followed by silk and satin, department stores, and dried goods, about 6 to 7 million yuan, which is more than in previous years. The interest rate ranges from 8 li to 1 fen and 2 li, which is negotiated by each bank and customer. Due to the relationship of the ten-end-of-month deadline these days, the collection and settlement of various industries is busy, but the entire finance is still stable, and money is abundant due to the influx of floating capital. The dramatic changes in prices are all manipulated by speculators and have nothing to do with the overall finance. Therefore, there is no problem for all industries to safely pass the ten-end-of-month deadline. A reporter from *New Voice* learned reliable information from the banking industry yesterday that banks have always adopted a prudent policy for long-term credit loans. They will never easily grant loans to old customers unless they have excellent credit, and they must have solid guarantors. Money shops focus on credit when lending money. It is now stipulated that there must be solid shop guarantors and personal guarantors. The association will formulate a credit loan guarantee letter and issue it to member money shops to follow the agreement. However, the interest rate will be determined by each shop.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese Child Welfare Association's fundraising for orphan care and education has been quite successful with the enthusiastic support of all parties. As of yesterday, a total of over 60,000 yuan has been raised, but it is still 40,000 yuan short of the target. Efforts are now being stepped up to actively solicit donations. As the association's fundraising campaign is scheduled to end on the 30th of this month, there are only a few days left.

<h3 id="e38">Refusal to Sell Low-Priced Rice Unabated; Urgent Need for Strict Investigation Otherwise the Common People Will Face Serious Threats; Ample Supply of Low-Priced Rice Sufficient for Current Needs <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Rice Merchants Association Explains the Reasons</p>
<p>At a time when rice prices are rising frequently, general rice profiteers are even thinking of refusing to sell the public's low-priced foreign rice to consumers, causing an uproar in public opinion and arousing public indignation. All unanimously called on the authorities of the two concessions to take decisive action to thoroughly investigate and deal with the matter. The two concession authorities, in response to requests from all parties, immediately dispatched personnel to secretly investigate. As a result, the dark secrets of Yuchengtai Rice Shop in Zhengjia Wood Bridge were finally discovered and dealt with according to law. It is now learned that this bad trend has now spread to the Public Concession. It has now been confirmed that the rice shops not only refuse to sell low-priced rice, but also fail to hang the paper cards issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council, and also hide the public warehouse's small polished rice from being sold, so that the common people cannot buy this cheap foreign rice, and are inevitably seriously threatened. Now, all the residents of the city are eagerly awaiting the strict ban by the authorities of the two concessions, and the Rice Merchants Association should also bear its responsibility.</p>
<p>Large-Scale Purchase of Low-Priced Foreign Rice</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession yesterday that the council has decided to continue to purchase low-priced Rangoon special small polished rice, so that it can be shipped to Shanghai in large quantities and distributed to various rice shops for sale at low prices, to benefit the people and maintain the original intention. It is reported that the number of foreign rice that has been shipped to Shanghai and stored in warehouses is considerable, which is sufficient to meet the needs of the current citizens. Because the purpose of the Municipal Council's purchase of foreign rice is to provide relief, the selling price is particularly low, and each stone (160 market catties) is still sold for 117 yuan in national currency. Citizens can all remain calm and must not panic each other. It is also learned that the Food Rice Warehouse Management Committee is also separately contacting to continue to order large quantities of warehouse rice. According to a member of the committee, he believes that the small polished warehouse rice that was issued to each rice shop for sale has not been sold out, and citizens can purchase rice from nearby rice shops, but the quantity purchased must not exceed one stone.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain Limited to Transactions in the Market</p>
<p>Recently, due to the resurgence of rice speculators, illegal transactions are being carried out in the market, and rumors are being fabricated to confuse people's minds, so that the rice market, which has been stable for a long time, has been fluctuating again, and the prices of national and foreign rice have been raised frequently. For a time, the price increase was quite strong. According to those familiar with the rice market, in the past two weeks, the average price of various rice and grains has been raised by about 25 yuan per stone. The sudden occurrence of this situation is purely due to the rampant influence of speculative bad habits. According to the Rice Market Management Committee, all subsequent rice and grain transactions are limited to transactions in the market: (1) Brokers' business of acting as intermediaries for customers is only allowed to be sold to rice shops in the market; (2) Guest goods sold on behalf of each distributor are only allowed to be sold to rice shops in the market; (3) Rice purchased by rice shops should be purchased from rice shops in the market. Once the transaction is completed, an inward and outward list must be issued, and it is strictly forbidden to buy and sell low-priced foreign rice in the market.</p>
<p>Rice Industry Association Explains the Reasons</p>
<p>The Rice Shop Industry Association of this city sent a letter to the Municipal Council to explain the reasons why Hong Kong rice cannot meet the market demand, stating: "Respectfully, according to reports from various rice shops that are members of our association, recently, due to the soaring rice prices, the Hong Kong rice sold by your bureau is still sold at low prices. General citizens who eat other rice and grains have also changed to eating Hong Kong rice. The sales of each rice shop have increased sharply, and those who purchase rice are crowded from morning to night. With the limited Hong Kong rice, it is impossible to supply the unlimited demand. Most of the rice shops have sold out 80% to 90%, and there is no rice to meet the market demand, but the rice buyers are still constantly purchasing, deeply feeling the pain of being unable to cope. We request that this be forwarded to your bureau to find a way to supply Hong Kong rice in large quantities to meet the needs of the people's food, etc. After investigation, the fact that the Hong Kong rice stated by each rice shop has been sold out and there is no rice to supply is a real situation. The announcement No. 5565 issued by your bureau today is an urgent measure to take care of the people's food, and the intention is very good. If each rice shop has Hong Kong rice, it will of course supply it to meet the needs of the citizens as much as possible. However, it has already been sold out by the majority, which is indeed the fact. The reason for this is that it is difficult to apply for rice. In the past, the amount of rice received by each rice shop was based on the average sales volume of each rice shop in the previous year. Later, because Jardine Matheson did not supply each rice shop according to the sales volume, the amount applied for was reduced each time. For example, if 50 bags were applied for, it would be reduced to 10 bags. Those who purchased 100 bags would be reduced to 20 bags. This is how the Hong Kong rice supplied to the rice shops has become less and less. The Hong Kong rice sold by the rice shops is sold out as soon as it is sold, and there is a danger of not being able to continue. This is one of the reasons. After applying for the purchase of rice and receiving the warehouse receipt, there are also restrictions on the time to take the rice out of the warehouse. For example, if it can be taken out at 8 am, it is often delayed until 10 am to 11:30 am, and then it is stopped. There is also no sufficient time in the afternoon, so the rice shops hold the receipt and wait for a long time but cannot take the rice out, or they can only take it out after two, three, or four days. Because there are many rice shops taking delivery of goods, the time is too short, making it impossible for each rice shop to take delivery of goods for sale in large quantities. This is the second reason. In addition, there are various procedures. It takes a lot of time for rice shops to receive rice. Those with the strength to store grain in the market have no problem, but the common people who buy rice every day rely on it for a living and are deeply harmed by it. Under these circumstances, each rice shop has Hong Kong rice from time to time, and there is no lack of panic. If we do not request a correction, we are afraid that the citizens will be even more suspicious. We are particularly requesting your bureau to quickly contact Jardine Matheson to quickly supply the Hong Kong rice applied for by each rice shop. The quantity should not be reduced, and it should still be supplied as much as possible according to the average sales volume of each rice shop, as in the past. At the same time, notify the warehouse management personnel to extend the warehouse delivery time, and please add more scale position staff and arrive at the warehouse early, so that each rice shop can quickly take the rice out of the market to maintain the people's food and stabilize the people's hearts. This is addressed to the Public Concession Municipal Council, from the Shanghai Rice Industry Association, October 26th.</p>
<p>The Market Conditions for Miscellaneous Grains Are Gradually Improving</p>
<p>The city's stock of miscellaneous grains is currently very substantial, but the miscellaneous grains have been controlled and monopolized by black-hearted profiteers, resulting in the price skyrocketing, and the prevalence of illegal transactions is rare in history. Fortunately, the authorities have taken effective measures, and the market conditions for miscellaneous grains have gradually improved, and transactions have been quite depressed. General hoarders and market monks are not without fear, and are urgently seeking to depreciate their goods and seek release. However, these people have ulterior motives and are still trying to be active in secret to deceive people. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to it. If it is found to be true after investigation, heavy penalties should be imposed to deter others. Then the market conditions for miscellaneous grains can be expected to remain stable for a long time.</p>

In addition, music and games will be used to entertain parents. Yesterday was the second Filial Piety Day as stipulated. Originally, it was planned to hold a reception for the parents of the members as usual, but due to time constraints, it was not held. Only various churches, schools, and Christian organizations engaged in official promotion, in order to slightly reverse the declining trend. In order to concentrate the work, the department has set the central work for each month of the year as follows: January is Aspiration Month, February is Bible Month, March is Friendship Month, April is Friendship Month, May is Labor Month, June is Health Month, July is International Month, August is Outdoor Month, September is Fellowship Month, October is Filial Piety Month, November is Service Month, December is Youth Month.</p>

<p>Songtai Fellow Villagers Commemorate Jin Xilin</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Songtai Fellow Villagers Association and the Jiangsu Pawn Industry Association and other organizations held a meeting at the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association to commemorate Mr. Jin Xilin of Jiading. Dai Boyin, Sun Fuji, Jin Jushan, Gao Chuiwan and other hundreds of people attended. Xia Langyun reported on his deeds, saying that he came from a famous Jinshi and went out to serve as the magistrate of Gui'an County. At that time, he was only one year old, and his political reputation was outstanding. He immediately took care of his father's funeral and went home to serve his mother, and no longer went out. He was very enthusiastic about handling public welfare matters in his hometown. Various public organizations recommended Shen Xinqing to preside over the sacrifice. After the public sacrifice was held, Chen Chuande, Yuan Xiluo, and Xiang Cong delivered speeches, and the meeting did not end until after four o'clock.</p>
<p>Jin's Deeds</p>
<p>Mr. translated Wenhan, Zi Xilin, has lived in Huangdu Town, Jiading for generations. Zeng Zu Xiang, Zi Qishan, was a Jinshi in the Xin Chou year of Qianlong, and was changed from Zhixian to Professor of Jiangning Prefecture. He supervised the Yixue and created Xuwu. He loved to read the books of Song Confucianism, and talked about morality with the students every day. When the internal disaster was over, he gave sleeves to the Professor of Fengyang Prefecture, and refused to go because of illness. He mainly lectured at the Pingjiang Jingye two academies. Ancestor Feng, Zi Mengquan, Zhusheng, a skilled writer, father Le, Zi Shaoquan, was early orphaned. During the Hong Yang Rebellion, his family business was ruined. He abandoned Confucianism and engaged in business. He was loyal, honest, and forgiving, and it was his nature. He did not care about every penny in the market. He did not add to the sound or color when collecting debts at the end of the year. The local chronicles have their biographies. Mr. was born with amazing wisdom. When he was young, he studied with his cousin Suigong Wenluan. Wenluan's son Mengxiang was a famous scholar. At the age of seventeen, he became known to the Academy with his poems and Fu, and then entered the Pan with the first name. In the Guangxu Yichou Enke, he was raised in his hometown, and in the Jiawu Enke, he became a Jinshi, and was selected as a Zhongshu in the Nei Cabinet. Because his parents were old and his family was poor, he asked to change to Zhixian and was assigned to Zhejiang. As soon as he arrived in the province, Jiaxing caused trouble because of the Cao Dynasty. The great government ordered him to go to investigate. At that time, Li Ling of Xiushui was also in charge of Jiaxing County. The two governing bodies were in the same city. He captured more than ten people and was about to kill them to show his prestige. Mr. entered the country and learned about it. He drove to the county government immediately. Li Ling was already sitting in the hall, and all the prisoners were tied up like sheep and pigs and were about to be executed. Mr. took out the provincial edict and restrained Li. Li said, "I have just received the order to kill them all without exception." Mr. argued, "I was commissioned to investigate and should be allowed to interrogate." Li insisted on not listening. Mr. insisted on arguing more vigorously. At that time, the prisoners in the hall called out their grievances, and the crowd was angry. The sound was mixed together. Guang Sheng Nai's Li Shao Xiu then retreated into the inner court and told him, "These are all innocent people. Now the public's feelings are surging, and if you kill them, it will definitely cause a riot. Who will be responsible?" Li Ling was frightened and began to listen to Mr. Nai Xiangyu's interrogation and sentenced two people to death. The rest were released. Mr. Xiaozhong said, "If there are abuses in the Cao Dynasty, we should replace the great officials of the Chen Dynasty and ask them to do so. Don't fall into the legal net." Thousands of people gathered, all happily called him a god and dispersed. When he replied, the great official thought he was talented and commissioned him to be the Gui'an County. The county belonged to Huzhou Prefecture, which has always been known as wealthy. So he welcomed Taiwong to the office, and everything was ordered. Taiwong was always kind and instructed not to be observant. Mr. Nai taught and encouraged farming and mulberry, and increased the academy's salary to cultivate the foundation of governance and revitalize literature and education. Every day, he was concerned with recuperation and recuperation. Since then, the litigation court has been in decline, and he took a board with him to visit the mountains and rivers during his leisure time. Even Pan Yue in Heyang would not be able to surpass him. After the Ox Year, Taiwong died of illness in the office. He helped the coffin back to his hometown and performed the ceremony with all his respect and grief. After the service was over, he did not go out again. He devoted himself to taking care of his family and smiling for more than ten years. The poor scholar's attitude towards his relatives is that he wants to be filial but may not be able to catch up with the salary, and he may be able to catch up with the salary and be filial, which is often cited as a lifelong regret. Mr. Du Kek made up for his wish. Isn't it a great blessing? When Taiwong first arrived in Gui'an, he ordered Qing Zuo to repair the ancestral hall and give it to his relatives, which were all things he had been thinking about all the time. Mr. followed the order closely and was not stingy, which can be said to be cultivating his ambition. Mr. has been living in his hometown for a long time, and he has made all the decisions on matters in his hometown. He does not refuse to work hard and complain, and he is especially good at resolving difficulties. He must make each person go away as he wishes. At first, neighboring villages and then neighboring counties came to ask for advice. Mr. took it calmly, and people did not doubt him. If his reputation were not well-known, why would he have reached this point? He was also superior in literature. In his later years, he once harmonized with his hometown seniors Fan Tongshu Chaoqiuliu's original rhyme in twenty chapters, which was beautiful and gorgeous, and was the best in the world. Those who knew him said that he was probably referring to himself. He lived in Shanghai to avoid the chaos, suffered from wind disease, and finally could not get up. He was seventy-four years old. He had seven sons, the eldest and second were American masters, and the rest graduated from universities and middle schools. They were all able to stand on their own. He had nine daughters, all of whom were married to noble families. It is said that I am five years younger than Mr. When Mr. was raised in his hometown, I was still taking the boy's test. Since Mr. Gongche went north and lived in the Beijing residence of Mr. Xu Xie Kui, he had been there for many years. When he won the Wei Ke and changed his official to Zhejiang, the city was far away from Huangdu, so I did not have the opportunity to meet him in person. When I returned home in distress, I started to see him several times. He once told me, "If you follow the hearts of the people, nothing will be impossible. If you go against the hearts of the people, nothing will be successful. It is the same way in the countryside and in the government." Wu Hu, this is why he can deal with everything and make everything appropriate. Mr. has a broad forehead, a bright spirit, and speaks only after careful consideration, and must be detailed and thorough, so he can make people listen attentively. When he suffered from the loss of time and the chaos, he was worried and angry and contracted the disease. It is sad. Dai Sigong of the same county wrote respectfully.</p>

They confiscated three pistols and twenty-two bullets. A Ningbo woman, Wang Xu, who was also involved in storing the weapons, was brought to the police station. The suspects were found to be young men from upper-class families who, due to:</p>
<p>A Predilection for Prostitution and Gambling</p>
<p>Had exhausted their wealth and resorted to a life of crime. They were sent to the Special Court for detention pending investigation.

<h3 id="e49">Intensification of American Public Opinion Against Japan - Translated from the New York Times <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>What is the position of American public opinion on the Far East crisis today? This question is of paramount importance as Japanese troops enter Vietnam and the Japanese fleet threatens the Philippines and American interests in the Pacific from the flank.</p>
<p>Since Japan began its advance into China and the South Pacific four summers ago, national surveys by the American Public Opinion Research Institute have been tracking the evolution of American sentiment. A glimpse into how dramatically American views on the entire Far East situation have changed can be gleaned from this.</p>
<p>(1) According to records from surveys four years ago, Americans were largely indifferent to the Sino-Japanese War. While they expressed sympathy for China, at least half believed that the future of the war had little to do with Americans. When asked in September 1937, 55% of Americans still said they maintained a "neutral" stance or had no preference regarding the future of the Sino-Japanese War.</p>
<p>(2) This attitude of American public opinion was short-lived. As Japanese troops advanced deeper into China, bombed the American gunboat "Panay" on the Yangtze River, and signed a treaty of alliance with Germany and Italy, their power gradually threatened the Philippines and the vast rubber, oil, and mineral resources of Southeast Asia. This caused a change in the American mind.</p>
<p>In less than two years, the majority of the American people supported boycotting Japanese goods and strictly prohibiting the shipment of scrap iron, gasoline, and other military supplies to Japan. From this perspective, American public opinion was prepared to abandon the "policy of compromise" far earlier than the government; the government announced the abandonment of this policy only in July.</p>
<p>(3) The results of a new survey now show that while most Americans do not want to engage in open warfare with Japan immediately, a majority believes that the United States should stop Japan's power, "even at the risk of war."</p>
<p>"Should the United States now take all possible steps to prevent the increasing expansion of Japanese power, even at the risk of war?" This was the question recently posed by the American Public Opinion Research Institute to voters in eighteen states across the country. The survey results began to be revealed in mid-July, just before Americans received the news of Japan's advance into Vietnam.</p>
<p>The results of this survey are as follows:</p>
<p>In favor of stopping Japan, even at the risk of war: 51%</p>
<p>Opposed to risking war to stop Japan: 31%</p>
<p>Undecided or no opinion: 18%</p>
<p>If analyzed solely based on those who expressed specific opinions, then those willing to risk war with Japan in order to defend American interests in the Pacific accounted for 62%, while those unwilling to be so radical accounted for only 38%.</p>
<p>Not only that, there is also a significant trend in American public opinion, because the public opinion research institute also conducted a survey less than five months ago, finding that only 40% supported the United States risking war with Japan if necessary to prevent Japan from occupying Singapore and the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>The results of the survey at that time were as follows (March 1941):</p>
<p>The United States should risk going to war with Japan to prevent it from occupying Singapore and the Dutch East Indies: 40% in favor</p>
<p>39% opposed</p>
<p>21% undecided or no opinion.</p>
<p>Since this shift, American opinions can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>"Japan can cut off all American trade in the Far East."</p>
<p>"If Japan advances south, it will mean the end of the Philippines."</p>

<h3 id="e51">Shanghainese, Having Learned from Repeated Lessons, Must Muster the Spirit of Atonement <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Da Ke</p>
<p>Before the establishment of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, the issue of maintaining or abandoning the Shanghai exchange rate was being hotly debated in Chinese official and unofficial circles. Establishing the Stabilization Fund was actually the establishment of the principle of maintenance because the words "stabilization fund" inherently include the meaning of "maintenance." If it were to be abandoned, what would be the purpose of the Stabilization Fund? The so-called rumor of "the Stabilization Fund abandoning maintenance" is, in fact, completely illogical. To confuse "abandoning the maintenance of the Shanghai exchange rate" with "abandoning the maintenance of the external exchange rate of the legal tender" is even more illogical.</p>
<p>However, since the establishment of the Stabilization Fund, rumors of this kind have been circulating more than once. This shows that Shanghai's position in Chinese finance has already changed; otherwise, this problem would not have occurred at all. Every time a rumor arises, the market is extremely terrified, indicating that the change in Shanghai's position in Chinese finance has been deeply understood by everyone, making them believe it without doubt. Therefore, it is not reasonable to simply hope that the Stabilization Fund will continue to maintain Shanghai without finding ways to improve Shanghai's position.</p>
<p>Given the great impact of these rumors on the market, continued maintenance has proven to be very effective for Shanghai's prosperity. If it were truly abandoned, Shanghai's situation would inevitably deteriorate beyond repair. Therefore, all those who enjoy Shanghai's prosperity must take responsibility and find ways to improve Shanghai's position. The Chinese account for only a small minority of those who enjoy Shanghai's current prosperity; the majority are foreigners, including the Japanese. While it is impossible to expect anything from the Japanese, they should reflect on their own actions. British and American trading firms in Shanghai should also take a long-term perspective and understand their own interests.</p>
<p>To improve Shanghai's current position in Chinese finance, it is not only those who enjoy its prosperity who should be responsible; in fact, even those who cannot enjoy this prosperity or are even being oppressed by it must also bear some responsibility. Just imagine the price pressure suffered under the threat of rumors has already increased to such an extent. If it were to become a reality, the oppression would certainly be even more severe.</p>
<p>Improving Shanghai's position is, in fact, a matter for China as a whole. However, Shanghainese should first reflect on themselves and take responsibility. This time, like in the past, the rumors have dissipated because the Chinese authorities reaffirmed their determination to maintain. However, if Shanghai's situation does not improve, the factors that generate these rumors or even the reality itself will not disappear. Therefore, when the Stabilization Fund carries out its work to stabilize the Shanghai exchange rate in the future, it will obviously have to find ways to improve Shanghai's actual situation. However, for the Stabilization Fund's work to proceed smoothly, it depends on the Shanghainese spirit of atonement and sincere cooperation.</p>
<p>So, what are the aspects of Shanghai's position in Chinese finance that need to be improved? In short, they can be divided into three points:</p>
<p>(1) To correct the situation where the Stabilization Fund's maintenance of the Shanghai exchange rate is only for outflow without inflow, the effect can be sought through three routes. First, exporters should voluntarily sell their export exchange bills to the Stabilization Fund. Second, trading firms that handle supply applications should independently match import and export exchange bills and request the Stabilization Fund's approval or defrosting. The success or failure of these two routes depends on the strength of the Shanghainese spirit of atonement, and to ensure the achievement of this goal, it is necessary to take the third route, which is for the British and American governments to declare that all import and export exchange bills and their exchange transactions within Chinese territory will have no legal effect unless they are stamped and approved by the Stabilization Fund.</p>
<p>(2) To correct the abuse of the exchange bills supplied by the Stabilization Fund, the effect can be sought through two routes. First, the banks that handle supply applications should bear joint guarantee responsibilities. Or, the Stabilization Fund should designate several import and export trading firms to be responsible for handling import and export matters exclusively. All import transactions for which the Stabilization Fund has approved the supply of foreign exchange must be entrusted to the designated trading firms for handling, and the trading firms will bear joint guarantee responsibilities. The wholesale price after import will also be supervised by the trading firms; if there is a violation, the Stabilization Fund can recover the foreign exchange it has provided.</p>
<p>(3) To correct the adverse impact of rising prices on the exchange rate, the Stabilization Fund and the Shanghai Concession authorities should jointly assume full responsibility. The Stabilization Fund should supply a fixed amount of exchange bills for rice and coal, the two major absolute necessities, on a regular basis, and should not handle them in the same way as other imports. Because the stability of the market prices of rice and coal can slightly reduce the degree of inflation for other goods. However, if the Concession authorities do not strictly implement the price stabilization of rice, coal, and other necessities, the Stabilization Fund's individual efforts will be difficult to achieve. Therefore, the Concession authorities should resolutely ban any free fluctuations in the market prices of rice and coal, while simultaneously prohibiting the selling price of other necessities, and use the revocation of business licenses, the confiscation of all inventory of illegal trading firms, and the non-guarantee of the solvency of debts after their confiscation as a backing for this price stabilization work.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Maintaining or Abandoning - A Clear Look at the Interests Involved: The Exploitable Value of Shanghai <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Sheng</p>
<p>Japan gains far more benefit than China from maintaining Shanghai's currency market.  If it were abruptly abandoned, the blow to the Japanese side would also be greater than to China. However, why does China want to maintain Shanghai?  Why, despite repeated rumors of a decision to abandon it, does China always reaffirm its determination to maintain it?  Rather than saying it's because certain problems are difficult to handle immediately after abandonment, or that, as Mother Ning said, the Chinese authorities have not completely given up on their attempts to rectify the Shanghai market, perhaps it's because the Chinese authorities are unwilling to take the path of "punishing without teaching" for Shanghai, which is crammed with four to five million Chinese and foreigners. This is indeed my personal speculation, but after comparing the exploitable value of Shanghai to various Chinese and foreign parties, it can be said that even if this speculation is not entirely correct, it is not far off.</p>
<p>Japan Gains More Than China by Maintaining</p>
<p>Let's first look at the contributions of the Shanghai currency market to Japan, which are mainly three:</p>
<p>(1) After the freezing of funds by Britain, America, and others against Japan, the foreign exchange rates of the Yen bloc have become fundamentally impossible to establish. Now, it relies entirely on the exchange rates of the legal tender (fapi) in Shanghai and Tianjin as a basis, and then uses artificial means to raise the "shenshui" (premium) of military scrip and allied notes against the fapi, in order to derive their foreign exchange rates as a pricing standard for foreign trade. If Shanghai did not have a currency market, the price scale of the Yen bloc would inevitably be extremely chaotic.  At that time, it would be even more impossible for them to maintain foreign trade.</p>
<p>(2) Since Shanghai has a currency market, Shanghai's foreign trade can also be maintained.  Therefore, Japan obtaining fapi is equivalent to obtaining military raw materials from third countries.  There are many ways for them to obtain fapi, such as issuing miscellaneous notes, levying taxes and exacting contributions, monopolizing and speculating, exporting to China, and so on.  In recent years, a large part of Shanghai's import trade is equivalent to Japan's imports.  With the Shanghai currency market maintaining its free state, Japan's exploitation is, of course, convenient.  Even with strict management by the Exchange Stabilization Fund, Japan can still extract from the Shanghai market by buying at high prices.  Moreover, techniques such as "ding mai dai qing wai hui" (buying on order and paying foreign exchange on behalf) are all the specialty of Japanese merchants.</p>
<p>(3) If the Shanghai currency market is not closed, Shanghai's prosperity will not stop.  Therefore, the wealth and labor concentrated in Shanghai will not be dispersed. Japan can then indirectly exploit them, and it becomes possible to achieve its aim of "using war to support war" by tightening its grip on the occupied areas.</p>
<p>Looking back at Shanghai's contributions to China, the realistic ones can be said to be almost non-existent, but considering the future, the relationship is not small. In short, they are:</p>
<p>(1) A part of Shanghai's foreign trade was originally equivalent to the imports of the free area of China. Now, due to the Japanese army's intensified blockade along the coast, and the westward shift of free ports in the rear, there is not much hope that the rear can utilize Shanghai's material supplies in the future.</p>
<p>(2) During the period when trade relations between Shanghai and the free areas were close, the maintenance of the Shanghai currency market directly benefited Shanghai's prices to some extent, and indirectly had the effect of stabilizing prices in the rear. Because if the difference between the prices in the rear and the prices in Shanghai exceeds all the additional costs of transportation, the import of materials from Shanghai will inevitably increase, and the rise in prices in the rear will also be considerably restrained. Now that Shanghai's material exchange relationship with the rear has declined, and Shanghai's prices are starting to rise unrestrainedly due to the speculative advance of commodities, it is better to use this financial power directly to stabilize prices in the rear than to stabilize exchange rates and prices in Shanghai to indirectly stabilize prices in the rear. After all, in the rear, there is still political power to back up the price policy.</p>
<p>(3) Although the rear's access to Shanghai's materials and the utilization of Shanghai's prices have lost their value, Shanghai is, after all, the richest area in China. Maintaining the prosperity of the Shanghai market ultimately contributes to the preservation of the nation's vitality. If the Shanghai market collapses due to financial chaos, it will have a great impact on post-war reconstruction. In addition, it is not unrelated to the stability of the morale in the rear and international perception. A stable Shanghai market also makes it easier to maintain Shanghai's neutrality. However, these are all unrealistic, or merely a kind of vanity.</p>
<p>China Loses More Than Japan by Continuing to Maintain</p>
<p>If continuing to maintain does not harm China, or if continuing to maintain can have the effect of an economic war against Japan, then it is still worthwhile. However, the reality is not so. If Japan is indeed disadvantaged by continuing to maintain the situation, China suffers much greater losses.</p>
<p>The main disadvantages for China are: (1) The monthly loss of having to bear a sum of money for the Exchange Stabilization Fund, most of which is equivalent to subsidizing Japan. (2) The development of speculative activities in Shanghai can attract funds from all over the country, including funds from the rear. (3) Since the Shanghai market has the magic power to attract funds from all over the place, it hinders the investment of funds in the rear. (4) Since Japan can use the Shanghai market to promote its policy of "using war to support war," this is also a great disadvantage to the war itself.</p>
<p>As for the disadvantages for Japan: (1) It hinders the development of miscellaneous notes, that is, it hinders its attempt to exploit Chinese materials without restriction through miscellaneous notes. But in fact, in the occupied areas, it can use force to back up this attempt. So, can miscellaneous notes advance into the Shanghai concession area? It is actually irrelevant. (2) The stability of the Shanghai market will naturally strengthen the unity of Chinese and foreign merchants in Shanghai. This should help maintain Shanghai's neutrality. The increase in Shanghai's neutrality is an obstacle to Japan's attempt to freely control the concessions. However, the reason why it wants to control the concessions is nothing more than wanting to get involved in the materials within the concession area. If the neutrality of the concessions is maintained, although it must indirectly obtain materials from the concessions, it can continue to enjoy them. If the neutrality is lost, the Shanghai market will collapse, and what it can obtain will be limited to the existing inventory. Therefore, compared with the two, there is actually no disadvantage.</p>
<p>Comparing the advantages and disadvantages of maintaining the Shanghai currency market for both China and Japan, there is no doubt that Japan's advantages are greater than China's, and Japan's disadvantages are smaller than China's. As for British and American merchants, their interests are even greater. If it were not maintained, China could still be given new or greater commercial opportunities, but the shaking of Shanghai's neutrality would shake their rights and investments in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Consequences of Abandonment Can Be Imagined</p>
<p>The unequal gains and losses of maintaining and the interests of all parties after abandonment are, of course, inversely proportional. In other words, as a result of abandonment, China's advantages would be greater than Japan's, but China's disadvantages would be smaller than Japan's.  Let us think about what kind of impact the two sides of China and Japan will suffer after the abandonment, we can know:</p>
<p>If the Exchange Stabilization Fund abandons the maintenance of the Shanghai currency market, China will suffer the following three adverse effects: (1) Shanghai's fapi will flow inland in large numbers, causing concerns about inflation in the interior. (2) It may promote the outflow of materials from the interior. (3) There is a risk of promoting commodity speculation in the interior. However, China can easily prevent this by restricting withdrawals and prohibiting exports, and at the same time, it can use funds for construction, and because the Exchange Stabilization Fund can henceforth fully maintain the import demand in the rear, and use political power to complete its strict control of exchange rates, it will be easier to stabilize exchange rates and prices.</p>
<p>But on the Japanese side, the adverse impact will be huge. (1) It will not be easy to continue to obtain the supply of military raw materials from third countries. (2) It will not be easy to redefine the exchange order of its Yen bloc. (3) The economic order in the occupied areas will fall into an unmanageable situation due to the chaos in the Shanghai market. (4) Due to the escape of fapi and the outflow of miscellaneous notes, prices will cause endless runaway inflation, and reflect its impact on Japan itself. At this time, Japan will inevitably strengthen the material exchange relationship within the Yen bloc, and try to adjust it. On the one hand, it will use violence to control all inventories and production institutions, and forcefully suppress price increases. However, due to the fundamental inability to be self-sufficient in the supply and demand situation of materials, and the inability to continue foreign trade, it will eventually embark on the path of consuming existing materials and reaching the final state of exhaustion. In the meantime, social unrest, the decline of public security, and the proliferation of black market transactions are inevitable phenomena.</p>
<p>As for whether Japan can establish a new currency in the occupied areas at this time, my answer is: it will certainly be easier to issue than it is now. But it will be much more difficult to succeed than it is now. Because now we can sacrifice the price of fapi and use artificial means to raise the price of new notes. Therefore, it is easier to arbitrarily control the prices in the occupied areas. This is one. If allied notes do not have a fapi black market and exchange rates with Shanghai, the material panic in North China will inevitably be more severe than it is now. However, each customs post in North China still has the possibility of a trade surplus in normal times. Central and South China have always had trade deficits. If the entire occupied area's foreign trade is fundamentally abnormal, not only will the new currency plan not be established, but even the existing attempts will not be able to be maintained. This is two. Japan's exports are for imports, and the occupied area's export capacity is small and its import demand is large. Therefore, the formation of the Yen bloc, pulling in the Northeast, is beneficial to Japan; pulling in North China, is still somewhat beneficial to Japan. As for pulling in Central and South China together, without fapi to facilitate trade with third countries, it is fundamentally disadvantageous.</p>
<p>As for Shanghai, it will, of course, bear the brunt. The imaginable situation is (1) The financial sector will be extremely chaotic. (2) Banks and money shops will be forced to close down. (3) Miscellaneous notes will take the opportunity to flow out. (4) Prices will rise wildly. (5) Shops will be unwilling to sell goods and will close down automatically. (6) As a result, the livelihood of citizens will be on the verge of exhaustion, robbery will be rampant, and public security will not be guaranteed. (7) Population and capital will escape at the same time. (8) Finally, it will be drawn into the Yen bloc and go to its doom together. At this time, the Japanese, in order to "adjust the supply and demand of materials in this city," will inevitably come up with a set of "overall adjustment decrees." As a result, private warehouses will become public warehouses, and to eat your own stored grain, you will have to apply to the Japanese authorities for a "removal certificate." As for the inventory in general warehouses and godowns, that goes without saying. To be polite, they will forcibly buy it with miscellaneous notes at "official prices"; to be impolite, they will confiscate it and make it public, and at the same time strictly declare that "those who hoard will die," as a foreshadowing for "punishing" those who resist orders.</p>
<p>In short, the advantages and disadvantages of maintaining or abandoning for China, Japan, and other parties are clearly revealed. The Chinese authorities' reiteration of continuing to maintain Shanghai is obviously to save Shanghai from possible disaster, not because China or the rear truly needs it, or has no choice.</p>
<p>However, to make China not disgusted with maintaining the Shanghai currency market, this is the business of the Chinese, foreigners, and even Japanese in Shanghai, as well as the authorities of the two concessions in Shanghai. If speculation and indulgence in speculation, manipulation and indulgence in manipulation, blocking the normal circulation of materials in Shanghai, and making absurd demands for foreign exchange for the import of unreasonable consumer goods, etc., that will only hasten China's determination to abandon it.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the city's Academic Lecture series held its thirteenth lecture at the Xuan Gong Theater. Professor Shao Jialin, Ph.D., was invited to lecture on "How to Study Science." Shao is a Master of Chemistry from the University of Wisconsin in the United States, and a Ph.D. in Chemistry from Cornell University. After returning to China, he served as a professor at National Jinan University and other universities. He is currently the Dean of the College of Science and Chairman of the Chemistry Department at Daxia University. His research and writings are often seen in well-known domestic and foreign magazines, and he is regarded as a chemistry expert. Therefore, yesterday, the audience who came to listen to him were very crowded. Chairman Zhu Xixuan gave an introductory speech, and then Shao began his lecture, explaining clearly and thoroughly. The audience was very excited. The outline of the lecture is as follows:</p>
<p>Definition of Science: Science is based on empirical facts, guided by profound intellect, and uses theoretical methods to discover the principles and laws of complex and intricate cosmic phenomena, forming a systematic body of knowledge.</p>
<p>Origin of Science: A. The origin of science has two motivations: (1) to adapt to the needs of practical life; (2) the stimulation of curiosity. B. Marvin, in his History of Philosophy, said that the emergence of science is due to the following six reasons: (1) imitation and learning; (2) expansion of curiosity; (3) improvement of analytical ability; (4) reduction of emotional impulses; (5) weakening of the ability to suggest; (6) progress of culture.</p>
<p>Stages of Development: Mach divided the development of science into three stages: (1) the experimental stage; (2) the deductive stage; (3) the formal stage.</p>
<p>Why Study Science: The purpose of studying science is to seek truth, that is, to discover the laws of the relationships between things (natural laws). In other words, the purpose of science is to give a complete, simple, and non-contradictory description of the relationships between things. The methods of studying science can be divided into three steps: (1) Collecting facts, including observation and experimentation. (2) Organizing facts, including comparison and classification. (3) Formulating laws, including generalization, hypothesis, verification, and establishment of laws.</p>
<p>The Spirit of Science: Those who study science should have a spirit of respecting facts and valuing accuracy.</p>

<p>The Black Man Cup small football charity tournament, sponsored by the Black Man Toothpaste Factory, was held at the Jiaozhou Road Poor Children's Education Institute field at 4:00 PM yesterday. Despite the violent storm, the audience was still enthusiastic. The ticket revenue was announced by the accounting department to be 2,674 yuan. There are still unsold and pre-sold tickets that have not been collected. After the two accountants, Li Wenjie and Chen Xianmo, have audited them, they will be announced again. The charity ball auction was hosted by Yuan Jiden. It was finally bought by the great philanthropist Zhu Yinliang for 1,300 yuan. In the first match, Měng Shī narrowly defeated Huá Měi 3-2 to win third place. The exhibition match was only played to halftime due to time constraints. The mixed team defeated the Leyou team 4-1. In the championship final, Ruì Táng and Yí Zhōng fought to a difficult draw, ending in a 1-1 tie. Neither side scored in the first half. The two sides shared the championship.</p>
<p>The Corner of Silver Cries Out</p>
<p>Huá Měi takes the lead. Cáo Wénhǔ receives a pass from Zhāng Bānglún and shoots fiercely from 15 yards. Měng Shī's goalkeeper Lù Pénglín fails to block it, and the ball goes into the net. In less than two minutes, Měng Shī's Qián Zǔzī scores. After 14 minutes, Xiāo Zǐwén also scores. Huá Měi's Cáo Wénhǔ equalizes at two goals each. Switching sides to continue, Měng Shī's three-pronged attack penetrates the enemy's territory. Hé Jiātǒng's decisive kick seals the victory. Měng Shī wins third place.</p>
<p>Exhibition Match Takes the Stage</p>
<p>Leyou plays steadily. At 7 minutes, Wáng Bō kicks the ball into the center. Before long, Leyou's Xǔ Kèhóng fouled, and a free kick was awarded, which Jiǎ Yòuliáng converted to equalize. Leyou had bad luck with the ball. Zhōu Qínxióng was eager to win and collided with someone in the penalty area, and a 9-yard penalty was awarded. Dài Línjīng took the penalty and scored. Before a minute passed, Sūn Fāng made a contribution and scored again. One minute before the end of the match, Ā Dài scored a beautiful long-range shot from 20 yards, into the bottom of the net. The score was 4-1 in the first half. Due to time constraints, the second half was interrupted.</p>
<p>Final Match</p>
<p>Gù Zhōng's attack was very strong. Although Ruì Táng had many opportunities to attack, they all failed to score. Neither side scored in the first half. Continuing in the second half, Gù Zhōng's Lù Fāngkuí received a pass from Wáng Dìngqiú and scored from 5 yards. Ruì Táng once had an excellent opportunity, but it all came to nothing. Gù Zhōng's Jiāng Tóngxǐ committed a foul and was penalized. Cài Shēngsēn took the penalty, but put too much force into it and missed. After a long time, Jiāng Tóngshàn committed another foul, and Cáo Qínfāng took the 9-yard penalty and equalized the score at 1-1. The sky was dark, and the competition could not continue. The competition committee announced that the two teams would share the championship.</p>

<p>The Sports Department of the Chinese YMCA in this city, due to the lack of sports venues for young people in Shanghai and the lack of sports activities, has created an indoor pentathlon. The five events are (1) Standing long jump, (2) Pull-ups, (3) Pick-up race, (4) Push-ups, (5) Single-leg alternating full squats. This sport does not require a large sports venue, can be practiced at any time, and is very convenient. Now, in order to promote it, the Chinese YMCA has decided to hold this sports competition every Saturday afternoon from 5:00 PM in the gym of the association on Sichuan Road starting from November.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Hearing the Cries of a Distressed Child - Giving People a Little Help <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai YWCA launched a fundraising campaign, which resulted in raising more than 185,000 yuan, exceeding the predetermined goal. It is indeed a very glorious thing for the women's community.</p>
<p>In fact, being able to give people some help is the happiest thing in life. Even if we see a little cat suffering from cold and hunger in the cold weather and give it a warm meal, it can give us an indescribable sense of comfort and pleasure in our hearts.</p>
<p>There are many people who think about their own interests all day long. These people are often unhappy. Conversely, some people are able to find ways to help others and are very happy all year round.</p>
<p>Moreover, sometimes helping people is not a very difficult thing. For example, the Rotary Club of Shanghai is currently collecting old toys, preparing to repair them and give them to poor children at Christmas. If our children have one or two toys, they can be sent to the Rotary Club. On the one hand, we can enable children who are not as fortunate as our own to enjoy some joy. At the same time, we can cultivate our children's compassion.</p>
<p>In addition, the China Childhood Welfare Association is now raising funds for the education and upbringing of refugee children. We may as well save some money from entertainment or other aspects so that the victimized children can receive education and upbringing.</p>
<p>In "Little Women" written by Louisa May Alcott, there is a passage that describes how Josephine's entire family knew on Christmas morning that a poor family had nothing to eat, so they sent their own food to them. This moving story can be staged in our own homes.</p>
<p>The newspapers have recently published a lot of news about rescuing orphaned children. I think that readers will certainly embrace the compassionate mindset of "feeling hungry as others are hungry and feeling drowned as others are drowned," and should always lend a helping hand.</p>

<p>— Li</p>
<p>Of course, there can be no secrets between husband and wife, but you must speak from the heart and never speak irresponsibly. Goethe, the author of "The Sorrows of Young Werther," once said, "You must not joke with women." It is indeed a profound and insightful saying, and it is also his experience, because he had been in love with many women in his life.</p>
<p>In the family, whether in words or actions, you should be honest and frank, and never talk nonsense. Many unfortunate accidents, in the beginning, are nothing more than a joke. Because the joke mentioned here is equivalent to a lie.</p>
<p>At the same time, if a couple can treat each other with honesty, they can also give children a good influence, allowing them to grow up in a good environment.</p>
<p>Marriage is really an art. To obtain the happiness of marriage, you must first see how hard you work.</p>

<p>— Germany</p>
<p>Many years ago, there was a Swede named Johnson who lived in Minnesota, USA. He worked in a textile factory, and his family was extremely poor. One evening, his wife had to return to her parents' home, so he stayed home to take care of the children.</p>
<p>That day, the children were especially fussy, and even giving them milk bottles couldn't stop their crying. When his wife returned home, they continued to cry. It turned out that a needle was under the child's body, and the child was being pricked, so naturally, they cried non-stop. "I will make a kind of safety pin so that children will not be pricked again in the future." Later, he indeed made a safety pin, and he became wealthy because of it.</p>
<p>In fact, there are many things in the family that can be improved. A husband who is interested in the family can not only enjoy family happiness, but may also have unexpected gains.</p>

<p>— Yingqing</p>
<p>I am a woman, a man's wife, and also a child's mother.</p>
<p>Four years ago, I met Dong—he is a Bachelor of Arts. Because I was surrounded by happiness from childhood, I have a special love for nature, so I also like literature. Therefore, we got married because we were like-minded, and soon we had a child. This beautiful and happy life made me feel proud. In my spare time, I often pondered, thinking I was the happiest person in the world!</p>
<p>But alas, heaven seems not to allow anyone in this world to live in a perfectly flawless environment!</p>
<p>One day, I was walking with my child in the park when I suddenly saw Dong there, with a beautiful young woman sitting next to him. They seemed very intimate. I went a little closer to see clearly—yes! It was him! I was angry, I was jealous, but immediately I thought of the child next to me, whose pure soul could not withstand such a terrible trauma. So I endured it, suppressed myself, and took him out of the park as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>He came back in the evening, and everything was as usual, still talking and laughing with me as usual.</p>
<p>I was suspicious, almost not believing everything I had seen that time. Finally, I secretly looked at his diary one time:</p>
<p>"...Ping has said a lot to me, expressing her desire for me. She hopes I can leave this suffocating island. She frankly stated that only she can create my great career. I can't answer anything except with a grateful look... No! I can't leave Mei, even though it will disappoint and sadden Ping. I want to fulfill my promise to Mei, and at the same time, I should be responsible for all of Mei's obligations... I don't want to leave Ping... I want to be a superman who can see through everything in life!"</p>
<p>Most of his diary was of this kind.</p>
<p>I understood, and I would secretly cry for this. But my pride would not allow me to tell anyone about this. Of course, rationally, I should sacrifice myself for their happiness, but emotion will never allow me to do that. I am a weak person; if I do this, it will undoubtedly lead to my own demise. However, I always think that I have a great attachment to this world.</p>
<p>I am now lowering my pride and sincerely confiding to my sisters and brothers, hoping everyone can give me a satisfactory answer. (Payment of ten yuan, full year subscription to Family Monthly)</p>
<p>Editor's note: There are many women in the same situation as Ms. Yingqing, but Ms. Yingqing is a lover of literature and should have better skills in dealing with this matter.</p>
<p>I think the husband of Ms. Yingqing's girlfriend should be considered to see if she can give him happiness, but even if possible, their relationship can only be limited to pure friendship. Fortunately, this point can be observed from his diary, he is very clear about it.</p>
<p>If there is an opportunity, it seems possible to explain frankly, but this is neither an argument nor a plea for help. At the same time, Ms. Yingqing should study her own advantages (what are the special interests of her husband, and on which points has she been negligent). For the sake of a complete family, for the future of a child, for herself, and for everything of her husband, Ms. Yingqing should sacrifice all arrogance and prejudice and do her best to handle this matter appropriately.</p>

<p>Last week I talked about "Thousand-Cut Meat" and several dishes and snacks using "Thousand-Cut Meat." This week, let's talk about several dishes that use Thousand-Cut Meat as stuffing. Such as stuffed fried tofu, stuffed cucumber, stuffed eggplant, stuffed crucian carp, stuffed gluten, meat-filled egg skins, meat-filled cabbage rolls, and meat-filled tofu skin, are all very good dishes for everyday meals. As for more elaborate dishes, then stuffing the Thousand-Cut Meat with chestnuts, ginkgo nuts, dried shiitake mushrooms, bamboo shoots, etc., and stewing them in chicken or duck, is called Eight Treasure Chicken or Eight Treasure Duck, and the taste is naturally more delicious; however, in a time of rising prices day and night, if you want to eat Eight Treasure Chicken or Eight Treasure Duck, each one will cost more than twenty yuan, so in this family menu, I dare not include it.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Just a Joke <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Wuwei</p>
<p>Recently, I saw a joke about Jewish people, and needless to say, it involved money again. The story goes like this:</p>
<p>A Jew and an Irishman were partners in business. They were deeply afraid that they would still need money in the underworld, so they agreed that the one who died later should put five hundred dollars in the coffin of their deceased friend.</p>
<p>The Jew said, "I lost. Poor old friend passed away before me."</p>
<p>"Then did you put five hundred dollars in his coffin?"</p>
<p>"Um... oh... why not? I put a check in; it hasn't been cashed yet."</p>
<p>Of course, such a thing may not necessarily happen in the world, but it's not that such a joke couldn't exist in the world.</p>
<p>Does it seem too sarcastic towards Jewish people? But the strength of the Jewish people lies precisely in this kind of thing. To go further, this kind of behavior may not be the "cuteness" of Jewish people.</p>
<p>Who wants to do unpleasant things, and who wants to do things that are obviously disadvantageous? Assuming that money is really used in the underworld, having a check for five hundred dollars would at least be easier to deal with than a penniless pauper. If this so-called "other world" does not have a monetary system at all, then even bringing US dollar bills—I heard these days that one US dollar can legally be exchanged for thirty-three or thirty-four yuan—I'm afraid it may not be able to solve the difficulties. These are just nonsense.</p>
<p>On the one hand, expressing everything in a reasonable and plausible manner, almost to the point of tears, while on the other hand, it does not harm oneself at all, and even secretly laughing, this is the style of the Jewish person mentioned above. That is where his victory lies.</p>
<p>We should sympathize with this Jewish person, admire his skills in dealing with the world; on the other hand, we cannot help but blame that meddlesome Irishman, why bother with such a thing!</p>
<p>However, perhaps such jokes really exist in the world.</p>

<p>I don't know which magazine had such a statement: "Dr. Otkin of Columbia University in New York said, "If men do not abolish the habit of haircuts, in more than five hundred and sixty years, they will become "bald"; women's hair is more prone to fall out due to their usual haircuts; because Otbo has studied the cause of hair loss for years, he believes that the scalp must have considerable weight to maintain it, but because this necessary real amount is reduced after haircuts, the power of the scalp is weakened, so hair is also prone to fall out."</p>
<p>This "terrible" prophecy, when heard by the average beauty-loving person, is of course "horrifying." But I most hope that it will come true early, because now a haircut costs one or two yuan. If it "comes true" then wouldn't it save money? People laugh at baldness; but I hope to be bald, admire baldness; why? "It goes without saying!"</p>
<h3 id="e72">Suggestions on the "Beggar Market" Proposal <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Jiansong</p>
<p>Recently, eight people, because of the approaching cold winter, hope that the authorities of the two concessions can establish large shelters for beggars sleeping on the streets and alleys. On the one hand, the mortality rate can be reduced. At the same time, the general infectious diseases within the concession can also be reduced. In particular, social order can also be greatly improved.</p>
<p>We strongly agree with this suggestion.</p>
<p>Mr. Ferry, the Director-General of the Public Concession Engineering Bureau, believes that this undertaking can be handled by the Engineering Bureau, and he also sees very clearly—if the Engineering Bureau can organize this matter, it will definitely be welcomed by the public. I say, Mr. Ferry is absolutely right, indeed, this is already a matter of great urgency.</p>
<p>As for the facilities of the Beggar Market, we believe that part of the work can be participated in by the beggars who have been trained in the current "shelter". As long as the funding is secured, it is okay to start immediately.</p>
<p>Regarding the equipment inside, we feel that there are several essential points that should be born together with the "Beggar Market", that is, several different, simple workshops: knitting socks and towels, making soap, and for female beggars, special embroidery tables for tablecloths, gloves, and other handicrafts. What is particularly important is to set up work-study schools for beggar children and night schools for part-time workers. Here, we can especially focus on teaching them how to imitate people and how to understand society. It seems that this is "close to high-sounding," but as long as the person doing it has talent, can share joys and sorrows with the beggars, live together, and does not use top-down teaching methods, then we believe that there is absolutely a guarantee of success. Although, due to the deep-rooted inferiority of the beggars, not everyone will be like this. Among the different degrees, there will definitely be many useful talents.</p>
<p>Therefore, we are prompted to raise the following question—the management issue of the Beggar Market. Here, we hope that like the "Children's City" in the United States, everything in this city, such as the mayor, engineers, doctors, teachers, workers, etc., is taken by the children living in this city. Of course, it is impossible for the beggars for the time being, but it seems that it is necessary to set this goal. And the administrators at the beginning should live the same life as the beggars, and avoid oppression that is high above, so as not to arouse resentment in them. This point should also be prevented in advance.</p>
<p>Secondly, the equipment of the hospital is also an indispensable major event.</p>
<p>If such a Beggar Market can be held, then not only will the current concession order be greatly improved, and the health of the residents within the concession will be better protected, but also when this group of beggars comes out in the future, they will be a large number of useful technical talents. This is a benefit that is extraordinary.</p>

<h3 id="e73">How to Be a Middle-Level Employee <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Xin'an</p>
<p>Middle-level employees are between superiors and subordinates. Pleasing superiors makes subordinates see them as running dogs, and pleasing subordinates makes superiors consider them disloyal. Therefore, to be a middle-level employee and to deal with everything well and make everyone happy, one must pay attention to the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Glue work - The so-called glue work is to try to make superiors and subordinates cooperate sincerely. Originally, the gap between superiors and subordinates is often due to improper handling or deliberate sabotage by middle-level personnel. If middle-level personnel can be intentional in doing glue work, then the gap between them can easily be eliminated. For example, in front of superiors, often talk about subordinates' words of faith in him, so that superiors have a good impression of his subordinates, thereby generating understanding and trust; at the same time, in front of subordinates, often talk about superiors' words of praise for them, so that they are loyal and obedient to superiors, and they can do their best in all assignments. In case the superior's behavior is a bit erratic; a middle-level employee must find a reason in front of the subordinates that can satisfy the subordinates or can promote the subordinates' understanding, and try his best to defend the superior, so that the subordinates do not lose faith in the superior and do not create rifts; At the same time, use roundabout methods to make superiors change their erratic behavior while maintaining their face. As the saying goes, "If you have good plans and good strategies, enter and tell your ruler internally, and then you will follow them externally, saying: 'These plans and strategies are only the virtue of our ruler.'" This is a good way to make superiors correct their erratic behavior while maintaining their face.</p>
<p>(2) Adjustment work - Work can be busy or simple, business can be busy or free, and superiors may not be aware of these. A middle-level employee must find ways to adjust their work in this situation. For example, when the work is tense and they are so busy that they can't get away, a middle-level employee can help them distinguish between urgent and non-urgent tasks, handle the urgent ones first, and handle the non-urgent ones after the urgent ones are done, or even allocate them to free time. For example, if A is busy today and B is free, then ask B to help A; tomorrow if B is busy and A is free, you can also ask A to help B; always make subordinates feel that they are competent and happy at work. In this way, there will be no backlog of delays, no uneven distribution of labor, and superiors and subordinates will be happy.</p>
<p>In addition, seeking loyal subordinates and increasing work efficiency is also an important task of middle-level personnel. The following story is an excellent example of seeking loyal subordinates: One year, a section of railway under the jurisdiction of the New York Railway Bureau in the United States had a problem, which almost caused a train accident. This matter was known to the superiors, who considered it the fault of the two engineers, and immediately ordered Mr. Crowley, the general manager of the railway bureau, to dismiss the two engineers. After Mr. Clark received this order, he believed that the past achievements of these two engineers were not bad. If he could save them from the frustration of being dismissed, or could make them work harder, he sincerely asked the superiors to forgive these two engineers. As a result, the superiors were moved by his words and immediately withdrew their order. When this news reached the two engineers, they were so moved that they could hardly speak. From then on, they became Mr. Clark's most loyal assistants. Like Mr. Clark, he can be said to be good at being a middle-level employee.</p>

<p>Fourteen The Life of Playing a Hero</p>
<p>"Of course, you can't sing the qingyi roles anymore!" He picked up the cigar again and took a few puffs. "But you are from a professional background after all. It probably won't be a problem to sing old male roles, old female roles, or clown roles, right?"</p>
<p>"Old male and old female roles are fine! Clown roles won't work, because I can't joke in my life!" As he spoke, Qiu Haitang couldn't help but stroke the short beard he had grown on his chin, about an inch long. "It's a pity that I'm a little old, otherwise I could still manage to be a second-tier martial artist! I remember when we were in the troupe, my second brother Zhao Yukun was the best at martial arts. He saw that I was too thin and weak, so he forced me to practice martial arts with him every day. So later, when it came to the days of singing rebel plays, I also played a few short-hitting plays like Four Heroes Village and Hua Butterfly. Long..."</p>
<p>"Okay!" Mr. Qian didn't wait for him to finish speaking, then immediately pulled him out together. "It's not a problem that you can handle these three types of roles. Xiao Jiqing, who is currently the backstage manager at the Red Theater, is also my friend of many years. Let me take you to see him first. Whether it's sweeping the floor while playing an old male role or a second-tier martial artist, just sing for a few months first, and slowly everyone will think of a way."</p>
<p>For this gentleman's enthusiastic help, Qiu Haitang was naturally grateful and tearful; and for the sentence he said "It's not a problem," he also felt that it was very correct. (246)</p>
