<p>社評</p>
<h3>美國將作重大決定</h3>
<p>羅斯福總統定於後日發表舉世所期待的「爐邊談話」，隔昨曾召集赫爾國務卿以决各軍政大員，如財長摩根韜，陸長史汀生，海長諾克斯，租借法實施專員霍布金及海陸軍參謀長諸人，磋商今後大計，不問可知，必與後日演詞有關。日來外間對於演詞內容，頗多揣測，或謂總統將宣佈護航，或謂將要求修正中立法，一說當宣佈全面戰時緊急狀態，一說當反對軸心挿足西菲；以上諸說無論孰是，美國將在今後數日內作重大決定，已屬毫無疑問。</p>
<p>英國自在巴爾幹與里比亞兩地受挫之後，接着就是近東戰事爆發，而維希政府又復宣佈「法德合作」，在這蘇土兩國態度噯昧，克利特島形勢險惡，近東和蘇彝十區同感威脅的今日，不列顚帝國的處境確已到了十分嚴重的階段，萬一大西洋或西地中海力面再發生一些波折，英倫當局顯將遭逢從來未有的危險關頭。在這種情勢之下，以保障民治國勝利爲已任的美國，不但將無以對人，抑且脣亡齒寒，轉瞬之間即須親自應付軸心凶燄延及西半球的實際危機。</p>
<p>綜觀近日美國動態，它那種再接再厲的積極態度，原已什在獲有明證；單以最近二三日的作爲而論，旣有衆議院海軍委員會的通過「特別艦隊」案，復有參衆兩院聯席會議之表決軸心輪船沒收案；諾克斯海長目不惜於一昨斷然主張美國必須準備作「足以媲美前賢」之犧牲，此在陸軍部則要求人民捐助二十萬品脫的血液，以作戰時軍民救急之用。凡此種種原已足夠昭示美國已在針對着最惡劣的塲合，從事必人的準備，不過，倘與當前的戰局形勢相對照，這些準備仍嫌其不足以濟「英國燃眉之急」！因爲所有法案，不是猶在立法過程中，即是甫吿通過，距有效運用之期尙遠；至若閣員們的演說，則又大多耳熟能詳，不是嫌其緩不濟急，便是苦其不能立即見諸事實；良以英國目下所需要的，乃是立竿見影的實際援助，決不是口惠而實不至的精神鼓勵，此所以全世界愛護自由，關心民治的人們，莫小引領企待羅斯福總統的「談話」，因爲羅氏是美國的元首，不僅一言九鼎，抑且敢說敢行；按之往事，他每次發言，輙能予人以極具體的啟示，今次談話，旣正在英國感到危急的時候，敢信其必能不負衆望，宣佈更具體更有力的決定，至低限度，亦必有以實踐「以戰具送至英國手中」的諾言。</p>
<p>這時候，軸心國的遠東盟友或者還在妄想利用美國即將有事於大西洋的機會，找到一些可資漁利的「夾縫」，以便利它稱霸東亞的私圖；可惜檢視昨天的美國電訉，一方旣有民主黨參議員李氏之斥責孤立派「向國防肌肉中注射致命的綏靖毒素」，一方更有衆議員韋斯的主張禁止石油運日，況以羅斯福總統八年半來立言行事血論，更無理由相信他會中途「變節」，因此敢斷言他在後天的談話中，定必重申他一貫的不妥恊主義，以廓清前幾天散佈於遠東空際的若干灰色報道。</p>
<p>有人說：在這樣初夏的季節，還沿用「爐邊談話」的字這倒是一句頗饒意義的趣談呢。</p>
<h3>美大使高斯　定明日呈遞國書　參事布特列一月後赴北平　主辦使館駐平辦事處事務</h3>

<h3>日駐英大使　重光奉召返國　美將續採經濟措置　阻止煤油供給日本</h3>
<p>倫敦　日本駐倫敦大使重光葵、昨日奉命飛返東京、與政府有所商討、重光葵原擬在松岡赴歐途中、與其一晤、嗣因松岡怱怱邇返東京、致未獲見、此間相信、重光葵殊有道出美國返日可能、當重光葵拜訪英外次貝立德氏、告以即將返國、並保證此行不致危害英·日關係、故不能認爲此乃兩國決裂之先聲、（廿四日合衆社電）</p>
<p>東京　政府發言人今日答覆關於召回駐英日大使重光葵之問話謂該大使之擬回國、　僅報告政府、該大使於松　游歐時木欲與之一晤、但因英人對此有訾議、故不果行、該大使駐於仳離已三年有餘云、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>東京　美議員企圖勸告羅斯福總統、繼續採取抵制日本之經濟措置、日政府及商界人士、均密切注視、美國將阻止煤油供給日本、「讀　新聞」宣稱、倘此項計劃果然實現、則夫·日關係將復趨緊張（二十四日海通）</p>

<p>洋米昨市先跌後漲、全日間有二三元之盤旋、惟最後收市則比之前晚祇略形微砌數角至元許血已、米市在節前漲跌兩難、或須經過一度盤旋、方能轉入正常軌道、而有正常之升降、早市開價因前晚疲軟、賣氣甚旺、期現各米一致盤小二三元、繼因內地幫及日商本街鄕莊均有趁平辦裝、市面頓時興旺、各檔洋米售價立即逐步回振、午後形勢仍見緊俏、惟亦乏鉅大之升降、英華司一號西貢最低一百三十九元、中一百四十元、高至一百四十一元、小絞一百三十二三元、碎米低一百元、高一百零二三元、現米小絞可以轉口者自一百零八元半漲至一百十一二元、工部局小絞自一百零一元至一百零三元、西貢一號自一百十五元至一百十八元、全日成交現米二萬包、英華司千餘噸、</p>
<p>厚簿粳等國米、貨主仍以貨稀不出、本鄉店胃殊屬平常、惟躉數吃戶去路反見活絡、故際洋米復平之間、行情亦乏變化、計開無錫鮮粳仍爲百三十四元、崑鮮粳百三十二元、中關至百二十七八元、南港早晚稻鮮特百三十二元、普通新鮮百三十元、次至帶宿百二十五元、原包新鮮百三十五元、普通百三十二元、百三十元、</p>

<p>雜糧　油豆交易銳減</p>
<p>昨日雜糧油餅市塲、叫囂聲浪、已减低一半、乃因各種實銷平淡、投機踢皮球交易、因時屆端節、益形斂跡、故大勢依然盤旋之格、各種行情祇有二三角上落、共計成交大連豆油六十五桶價爲一百七十八元原盤、膠州生油二百三十件、一百十八元、烟事聽裝生油七百聽、一百五十五元五角、歸德黃豆二千餘包、四十五元五角、次爲四十四元八角、其他苞米做開二千包、及靑豆餅一千片、甡記期餅二萬片、</p>
<h3>金融　華銀行套進　外匯回平</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、各滙未更、暗市變動仍微小、英余允呆定、美滙穩中帶硬、外商各行供意較上日爲佳、美金五元四三七五一度可結、而華商投機家套扒者有塞出、但金子幫及華銀行均有吸進、故不久回平、終與英滙均與上日收價同、下午週六無市、半日交易不寂、</p>
<p>英美均無榮辱</p>
<p>自晨外電銀市、大條下縮、美銀未更、印銀一致回長、國際滙兌美對英小一五、餘平、中央掛脾各滙仍平、內盤早開銀行賣價、現貨英滙三辦士三二五、美金五元四〇六二五、投機家首起扒進本月美金五元四〇六二五、一度難獲、但不久某英銀行照上價供結、當見回平、匯豐掛脾各匯均平、白銀平衡稅低半分、計徵百分之二三·七五、投機家紛起塞出五六月美金五兀四三七五、但金子套頭則來同價套進、華銀行亦有吸胃、故鬆勢亦未易展開、收市現貨至六月期、均英滙三辦士三一二五、美金五元四〇六二五、均與上日收市價無異、</p>

<p>金市波動日小</p>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗盤、波　日小、起　於六千四百元大關左右、各方人心稍帶不定蓋國內外消息、利多　空均有、美金常露鬆狀、目於各方均懷觀望聲中、某搶帽者獨售千餘兩、金號亦售出、故價回上至六千四百十五元、復退至六千三百八十八元低價、終見銀號天元補空稍見回升、收市仍軋小九元、半日交易的二萬兩、下午週六金市、塲外無價、掉期五月轉入六月期一賣方貼出升至七十五元、旋又回至七十元、買方貼進、現金隨之而軋跌、中與進萬豐、及成記進祥和各一百兩、價照期交高三百三十元、福康永出益大時和各五十兩、高三百三十五元、比上日略小數元、飾金關金等均平、</p>

<h3>匯劃貼水低落之因</h3>
<p>本市滙劃貼水、每千元近已跌全一元左右、與前每千元需貼費二百餘元、不啻霄壤之別、查低落原因、爲外埠資金流滬益衆、尤其平津兩地、因滙水合算、滙出之款已達數千萬元、再加本市外滙放長、以前購藏外滙與外幣者、頗多售出、轉爲法幣、而一部份華商銀行、因銀行聯合準備委員會對於劃頭往來戶、除减息外、並規定限額、逾額不計利息、同時洋商銀行通知華商銀行减低有額、並聞某洋商銀行對於華商銀行存款、非但不給息、若超過其規定存額、反要徵收手續費、因此劃頭用途减少、一部份華商銀行對於鉅額劃頭存款、不大願意收受、免耗利息、至於滙劃存款、係按市拆每月計息、並無限額、且滙劃有担保品、穩實可靠、所以頗多將法幣掉爲滙劃、利息可不吃虧、照此看來、法幣與滙劃即可平掉、說不定將來滙劃反可得升水、則又爲事之無常者也、（幅）</p>
<h3>煤炭　廠方惟恐　煤球跌價　——趁賤即來收進——</h3>
<p>煤球行情、日前因囤戶鑒於白煤暗跌、勢恐影響煤球廠盤、爭先恐後、紛將老單出籠、低盤迭現、中國利中煤球、曾喊過一百七十元、旋因各廠鑒於本單暗盤廉於成本、趁賤吸收、行盤爲之一振、惟大廠貨棧單極缺、故能擯持二百九十六元廠盤、倘下月來源加增、水脚回低、或有跌價可能、</p>
<h3>銀行（三）</h3>
<p>至其時戶部何以不自銀辦行，而必由盛宣懷去辦，亦可於此復奏中見之。其言曰：</p>
<p>「至銀行仿自泰西，通商惠工，皆以是爲樞紐，非徒爲取息而設，亦豈僅造粟一端。中國風氣未開，京師票號錢莊，皆由商人自出資本，並未承領官軟，是以力量甚微；而匯豐華俄各銀行，遂先後同設都城，得以擅我大利。若於萬方輻輳之區，先開官銀行，爲各省倡，內可通華商之氣脈，外可杜洋商之挾持，裨益自非淺然。第官股旣未易籌措，商股亦未易招徠，更恐經理不得其人，利未興血弊先見，此又設銀行之難也。」</p>
<p>中國通商銀行開辦時，信用未著，所發行之鈔票不爲世重，未能流通自如。乃一方聘用洋人爲經理，以便與洋銀行聯絡，遂亦加入洋商銀行公會。一面聘錢　中饒有地位者爲經理。蓋其時猶是錢業稱霸時代，惟因受洋貨入超影響，致使白銀外流，人於洋商銀行之手；乃得利用以操縱我金融，壓迫華商，然至出口季節，華商銀根寬裕，洋銀行有時亦仰華商之鼻息。且匯劃錢莊係無限性質，一紙莊票，洋銀行受之不疑；而華銀行大都有限性質，　當初開辦時，洋銀行對之，轉不若錢業票據之信任。　銀行發行鈔票，只要綫業肯收解，市面即可流通。非但淸季如此，即民國十年以前，凡開辦銀行，必須延攬錢業中一二老宿，司營業部分可知矣。於是盛宜懷即請錢業董事謝綸輝任經理。謝即　言於盛曰，「今之通商銀行，已是虛本實利，此後惟不再動片銀行款項，方可接辦。」盛頷之。蓋所謂盧本實利者，謂本已動用，而利則須實付也。</p>
<p>有詢謝以辦銀行之方法者，謝以一語報之，曰「死人額角頭。」董其　謂銀行辦事，絲毫不可茍且，必須循規守章，如死人額角頭之硬綳綳去做也。又詢以銀行如何可以辦得好，謝謂「洋錢常眼鏡，」壯語之意，雖不至如俚諺所云「銅錢眼裏翻觔斗，」　銀行之重要業務，爲吸收存款，發展放款，只認洋錢不認人，」固要將洋錢進出看得淸楚也。</p>
<p>通商銀行所發之鈔豐有銀圓票，亦有銀兩票。銀兩票爲通商銀行獨家發行，故雖求照部議鑄發一兩銀圓，而已發行銀兩鈔票。自謝進通商後，鈔票之信用始固，與洋銀行鈔票同是述通於市面也。</p>
<p>華俄道勝銀行之開辦也，其勢張甚。時上海以匯豐銀行隱然執金融界之牛耳，道勝銀行思超越之，不但業務上與之競爭，即建築上亦務求過之，故特建石質行房，以相矜炫，上海之第一所「石頭房子，」自道勝始，即今中央銀行之行址也。不僅如此，且於其旁闢廣塲，爲行員業餘拍球之用，至今猶存其半，可見其設備之富麗周至。蓋此時之匯豐銀行，猶無今之巍巍巨廈，轟立於黃浦江畔也。</p>
<p>常道　初辦時，滬上盛傳有四太后投資五百萬兩在內，事秘莫能詳。惟在甲午新敗之後，屢遇外侮屢遭敗衂，俄人利用時機，陽示結好於淸延，助之收回遼東割地，陰實爲未來租借之　步，而成日俄戰役之引綫。淸延亦思　俄　外援，以與日抗，只圖洩憤，不　後患。又鑒於日據遼東，臥榻之旁，他人酣睡，惟恐患生不測，事出倉皇，道　銀行適於此時開辦，陰以寄託於俄人，此在事實十不能明辨其有無，情理上　不爲無因。何况有僚貴挨，正以淸廷飭令　效，陰將巨額私財，存放於洋銀行，藉免查抄　索之累，幾成風氣。如光緒二十四年正月黃思永以各國爭欲承借債款，不如募集內債，亦言及中國人寗將款項有放於洋商，並賭　其證劵云：</p>
<p>「通商口岸，華民依傍洋人，買票（按即指債票股票而　）借款者甚多，不能自用，乃以資人。目搢紳之私財，寄頓於外國銀行託名洋商營運者不知凡幾。」</p>
<p>此搢紳兩字，猶未敢公然指斥爲王公巨卿耳！故又云</p>
<p>「小民不足責，請嚴飭中外臣僚，激以忠義之氣，先派官　以爲民倡。」</p>
<p>此則明明言臣僚以私財寄於洋商銀行矣。尚有最明顯之一例，爲日俄戰爭初起時，慶親王奕劻將其私款自兩交戰國之銀行，轉存於匯豐銀行，蔣式理奏參有云：</p>
<p>一　親王奕劻於光緒一十九年（西曆一九〇三年）十一月一十二日日俄　戰消息，將華俄道勝銀行日本正金銀行所存之私產一百二十萬，提往東交民巷匯豐銀行存放。該銀行明其來意，多方刁難，始允收存，月息條給一厘。」（未完）</p>
<h3>紗花　港銷微動　紗市迥旋</h3>

<h3>自省</h3>
<p>— 小寗</p>
<p>「自省」，「目省」，小朋友們，道個名詞也許你們已聽得厭了？可是，你們之中眞眞做到的有幾個呢？我想一定是很少吧！</p>
<p>「爲什麼要自省呢」？有許多小朋友一定要不解了。回答這個問題可分爲下列幾點：</p>
<p>一、你承認嗎：世界上最能認識你（就是說：「知道你所做所想的一切」）的，只有你自己！當然，你的一切該由你目己深深地去推敲，去擔負，至於別人的指敎你，不過是幫助的性質罷了！</p>
<p>二、自省可以發揮你的理智，換句話說，不斷的反省，你的理智力也更强大了，因爲無形中你的辨并是非黑白的能力是提高了！</p>
<p>三、自省能養成你謹愼把細的好習慣！</p>
<p>四、自省能修養你的品格，促進你的進步！</p>
<p>世界上沒有一個人敢說他是沒有缺點的，正因爲如此，「自省」才是他最好的補救辦法，所以，小朋友們，當一天過去了的時候，你們該靜心地反省一下：今天有沒有做過不好的事，說過不好的話，有沒有浪費過時間，欠　過功課……要是發現了錯處的話，那就立刻消滅它！　過它！這樣，你們的進步，一定是加速度的！</p>
<p>瞧吧，歷史上！多偉大的人物，他們不都是有着很偉大的自省的精神吧？是的，小朋友們，要　你們要做一個偉人，你們也應該發揚自省的精神，努力檢討自己！</p>
<h3>愛美的成績爲什麼不好？</h3>
<p>— 宛</p>
<p>克雄和愛美是兄妹兩個，同在勤志小學求學，克雄比愛美長一歲，所以讀書的年級也比伊高一班，在平日散學後，克雄總是跳跳蹦蹦的玩着，不到七點鐘是不肯溫習功課的；而愛美呢？却不是這樣，回到家裹就拿着一本書，不時的念着，可是小很專心，母親在和鄰人講話，伊就要聽他們講什麼，不知誰家的孩子哭了，伊就要走出去看到底有什麼事發生，老是拿着書本，走到　走到西的，所以遇到這天功課眞的很多，伊在晚上就急得哭起來。</p>
<p>日子一天大很快的過去，將近第二次小考了。勤志小學裏的敎師們，也開始準備考試的工作。所以懶惰的學生們也不得不翻開生疏的書本，來準備這重要關頭。這時愛美的讀書時間格外長了，而克雄除了早一點鐘溫習功課外，仍逍遙自在的玩着，在他人看來，愛美是比克雄用功得多了。</p>
<p>在兩張報告單到了父親的手裏，不免奇怪起來，爲什麼愛美的算術小及格，而克雄的成績反而優良？，在數度的思慮下，他知道愛美的讀書方法一定不得當，於是把伊叫到面前，問道：「你考試的時候怎樣準備的」？伊答道：「父親，我在考試前　是預備得很好的，從頭至尾的讀幾遍，直到背得出，可是到考試時不知怎樣都忘了？如這次考算術，有很多題日都不是書上的，在書上做過的項目，我都做得出」。父親父問：「你是否都明瞭的呢？」伊說：「有很多不明瞭的，不渦我記得很好的啊！」父親就指導伊說：「你死記的方法是不　的！難怪你沒有玩的時候了。你要知道以後要功課好，就要改變讀書的態度，第一讀書時要集中注意，腦中不可存着雜念，也不可東張西望，專心一志的注視大書上，才有心得。第二要澈底明瞭；無論對於什麼課目，有一點疑惑，直到問明白後才止，那時你已得到了眞正的學識，也不易遺忘了。第三要辨別書中的要點所在，把它用筆劃出，用不到死記書中的字句，以致浪費時間，第四把劃出的重要之點加以組織一下，比如歷史中一件事情，把它的原因經過結果，分析得淸淸楚楚，在記時就便利而容易得多了。然後，我們知道了書中的內容，就把書闔攏，在腦中回憶一下，有不明瞭不純熟的地方，複習一下。如果這樣的準備，不但得到了眞正的學識，而且在考試時即便遇到難的題目，也會演變了。你的哥哥因爲得到了這讀書的秘訣，所以讀書時間雖短，反而收到了成效，你不妨去試試看吧！」愛美很快樂的得到了他父親的指導，知道了自己的缺　，於是把它牢牢的記在腦中</p>
<h3>關於日記</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>日記是個人的歷史，如果把每天所接　的事情，記些下來，日後偶一翻閱，的確具有歷史的價値？而且每天寫日記？對於寫作的技巧，自有莫大的幫助，比每週上兩小時作文課要有益得多。明白到日的價値，然後可再討論到關於日　的種種問題。</p>
<p>在開始寫日記之前，有一個先決的條件，就是要有恒心，這可算頂難的事情。我們曾看到過好多人寫日記，起初特別的高興，每天會寫，日後就隨便，想到去寫，不想到就不寫，到後來竟至擱筆不寫。蛇尾虎頭有始無終。所以我們不寫日記就算，要寫日記，就得抱有決心，每天寫，天天寫，非有始有終不可。</p>
<p>寫日記找題材是個問題，我們知道現在所說的日記，不是以前那祇記陰，　，　，雨，今天何時起身，何時進　，有何人來看我那麼的刻板式的日記。我曾爲同學說過。我們一天中所見的，所遇的事情很多，不必逐一記下，而所記的要非有價値記下的事情，不是奇特罕見，就是觸景生情，有悲喜之感的事情，才値得記下來。好像做小說一樣，把不需要的題材先去掉，剩下的都有殊旨，値得記下，才可把它記將下來，否則日記的價値何在</p>
<p>學校方面，限同學每週寫日記兩篇，事實上一週中寫兩决日記，儘有許多可以寫下的事。但多數同學，對寫日記　感到頭痛，主要的原因就在找題材困難。批改的時候，所看到的盡是糶平米哪，乞丐討發哪，巡捕打人哪一類事情，或是看書的，看電影的同學，把書本或影片說明書抄一段就算敷衍過去。這樣的日記，委實太平凡了吧？</p>
<p>然而　得說回來，同學們在日記中好的題材也未始沒有，衹是不多而已。記得去年有一位同學，記他某天放學回家，當他在溫習功課時，他的父親回來，邀了朋友來打麻將，馬上要他讓出桌子。他在寫字，讓得遲了些，引起父親的怒火把他罵了一頓。他就和父親爭執，向父親責問打麻將要緊，還是讀書要緊？同時，使他感到對家庭敎育的不滿。</p>
<p>最近又有一位女同學，寫伊家裹同屋子的人家，這幾天都在鬧着　用娘姨同題。到薦頭店裹喊了娘姨來，不是吃一頓飯走，就是住一夜走。人多不做，工錢小父不做，沒有衛生設備又不做，爲的要倒馬桶，有小孩子也不肯做。僱娘姨是這樣　，而每一家薦頭店裹卻坐是了待僱的女人，米是一百多元一　了；因此伊正懷疑着上海社會的畸形，矛盾，是出乎想像的。</p>
<p>像上面所舉的兩種，雖然不能算了不得的題材，但一般說來，比較已是具有記載價値的日記村料了，比別人所記的來得有趣味，有研究價偵的。所以我特地介紹給本刊的小讀者，如果要寫日記，那我們就得一天到晚的注　着抓住的日記的題材，不要因疏忽而放過，吾則是太可惜的。</p>
<h3>傷風</h3>
<p>— 金箴</p>
<p>天時不正，忽冷忽熱，在這幾天中更是顯著，上半天太陽還沒有伸出頭來的時候，空氣已是很悶熱，到得太陽一照射，寒暑表上的水銀柱即刻向上爬，而快達到九十度左右的光景，害得阿慧着了單布衫　它還熱哩。忽然頓時片片的白雲驟集起米，把那太陽遮蔽得沒頭沒腦，樹梢間突然發出呼呼的風聲，接着屋脊上聽着一陣傾盆的大雨聲，再加上閃閃的電光和轟轟的當聲，陣頭雨的條件—雷·電·風·雨·總算是具備的了。不到一個鍊頭，風停止了，雨歇住了，電不閃了，雷不響了，雲散開了，可是寒暑表上的水銀柱突然的暴降下來，在這相隔不過一個鐘點，而氣候的相差宛然有兩個季節—，盛夏和晚冬。阿慧身上當然是覺到一些寒意了，可是他小想再去加一件衣，這樣便促成了他患傷風的動機。隔了一日，傷風的特徵便就一一顯出來—噴嚏打，喉嚨啞，鼻孔塞，體發熱，阿慧　得躺在牀上，不能到學校裹去讀書了。</p>
<p>他的父親時常到床邊來看看他。有一次他竟把「怎樣會傷風」？的一個問題來問他父親。</p>
<p>「傷風是最普　的一種疾病。那是受了冷的緣故，但這也是由於細菌的原因；並且大多是從別人傳染得來的，而最容易傳染的方法是傷風細菌隨着風力散播出去。一到我們鼻孔和喉嚨裹，如果身體不大强健，或者是過分疲勞，或者是消化不良，或者是父了寒，這種細菌便乘了這種好機會，很快的侵入了我們鼻孔喉嚨，並且繁殖起來，以致發炎腫脹，所以覺得鼻孔阻塞，而且多鼻涕，喉嚨發啞，這都是發炎腫脹的結果。當一發生傷風，就應當發生咳嗽和睡在床上，是最好的治療法。要知道傷風能傳染給別人的。所以一睡在床上，不但可醫好傷風，還可不致傳染給別人。我國有一種傳說：就是息了傷風之後，便寫了好多張紅紙，上面寫着「出賣重傷風，一見就成功」，分貼着馬路的電綫桿上，這樣別人一見之後；那傷風便可傳給那人，而本人的傷風便可痊愈了。世界上竟有這樣靈的醫法嗎？這完全是一種毫無　思的舉動，更由此可表示出我國人的自私自利。然而傷風確是要傳染的，但也不應該有意的傳染給別人，應當預防傷風的傳染，就是一個人獨住在一間房裏，打開窗戶，使得通風，吃有滋養的東西，睡得十分充足，還樣經過一星期的調養便可好了。」</p>
<h3>禽獸也會參加人的戰爭</h3>
<p>— 德綱</p>
<p>小朋友們我們考振歷史上知道有很多禽獸都能幫助人作戰。譬如我國古時有用刀在牛角上使衝鋒殺　；在外國中古時代，兵士時當愛將蛇或璧虎等可怕爬蟲，擲向敵人軍營或戰艦上去；也有利用貓或鼠，帶了汚穢物驅向敵營中去，後來還有人發明在鳥尾上擊了燃煥的木條稻草等讓它們飛向敵人屋頂上，使它起火；種種利用禽獸作戰的方法不知有多少。在現代戰爭中能助幫人作戰的禽獸也很多，最爲人稔知的，當然是軍用犬和信鴿，它時替們所人擔任偵察　遞消息等任務；了犬和鴿外，還有若十其他動物，也都能助人作戰，我　向小朋友們一一介紹：</p>
<p>第一個我願介紹的就是猪；在第一次世界大戰時協約國的軍隊便會利用它們作戰。因爲那時德軍的陣地，和這次完全一樣都是滿佈着地雷網，英法軍隊若要貿然向德軍進攻，那是件非常艱苦而危險的舉動。於是便有人想出一個巧妙的方法，去破壞德軍的地雷陣他們將許多猪驅向德軍的地雷區域去。這些可憐的動物絲毫不知自己生命的危險，而儘是在叫野裏亂奔，亂跳亂踐，結果大部份却觸着可怕的地雷，結果了它們的生命，替協的國的軍隊打開第一步困難的工作。置次戰時除了豬外，英法軍隊還動員不少牛隻　担任這掃雷工作。</p>
<p>其次要介紹的是馬；馬在戰時有一個最高貴的任務就是負了騎兵，在戰塲上馳騁，担任搜案進出等工作，餘外馬還有個副職務，就是馬身上的血清可治療不少兵士的許多傳染疾病。最近德國政府曾徵發大量農人的耕馬，充作軍用並將許多動物園中的象和駱駝放出，代替馬作耕田駕車　事務。</p>
<p>貓在戰爭中也有它的份，因爲牠的敏感嗅覺對於若干種毒氣極易嗅出，所以貓能幫助預防敵人的毒氣進攻。在法國有一個紀念一隻貓的墳墓因爲道隻貓在第一次世界大戰時，曾終日伴了他的中人伏在壕溝內作戰，每逢德軍用毒氣進攻時貓便將爪抓他主人的衣服，好像叫他快戴防毒面具預先提防的意思，因此救了他主人多次的生命。</p>
<p>末後我要介紹的就是蜘蛛；蜘蛛怎樣也能助人作戰呢？原來蜘蛛絲，於各種光學儀器，如砲隊用的測量鏡，千里鏡等，都有很，的用處。因爲蜘絲極細黏在鏡片上，可作很正確的瞄準記號。最近英國有不少的光學家，已奉政府命令披捕大量的蜘蛛，以便提出細絲加緊各種戰爭上用的光學器械。</p>

<h3>彈詞三響擋</h3>
<p>— 楓</p>
<p>蔣朱·沈薛·朱趙</p>
<p>蔣朱，沈薛，朱趙，固盡人皆知爲彈詞三響擋：蔣如庭，朱介生；沈儉安，薛筱卿；朱耀祥，趙稼秋等之簡稱也。彼等近十餘年來，紅遍江南，鼎足而三，無分軒輊。有以二擋書藝孰高孰决相質者，予不能答，姑試述其異同。論能書：則蔣朱擅落金扇，雙金錠；沈薛擅珍珠塔；朱趙擅啼笑姻緣；亦彼等成名之書也。此外蔣朱更能三笑，雙珠鳳；沈薛更能楊貴妃，啼笑姻綠，（脚本與朱趙異，朱趙更能華麗緣，四香緣，描金鳳，大紅袍，玉堂春等書；以朱趙能書最多。</p>
<p>論唱</p>
<p>（調）則蔣朱宗俞；沈薛宗馬，耀祥宗馬，稼秋宗俞，蔣朱宗俞而神似！沈薛宗馬而稍異；朱趙宗馬宗兪而大異；論者謂爲自由調云。介生之唱柔糯；筱卿之唱淸腌；有金嗓子之譽；稼秋之唱活潑。如庭歌兪調，不弱於介生。儉安之唱，以饒韻味勝。惟自敗嗓而後，總難討好，論者稱其韻味猶存，自亦妥貼。耀祥之唱，沉重渾厚，亦自可取。</p>
<p>論彈</p>
<p>則二擋配合皆緊湊。蔣朱之彈妙在幽靜；沈薛之彈妙在嘹亮。尤當介生歌婉轉之兪調時，如庭三絃，隨調之高低疾徐而和爲抑揚頓挫之音，更稱神技。</p>
<p>論說表</p>
<p>蔣朱以穩練　；沈薛以灑脫勝；朱趙以刻劃勝。如庭去書中角色以落金扇之陸福，雙令錠之戚子卿，小二官，最稱拿手。狀陸福痴呆，小二頑皮之態，維妙維肯，聽者無不爲之絕倒。儉安則方母思兒，姑母勢利，說表之間，描摩盡致。故沈薜之婆媳相會，紫薇廳姑姪相爭二段，迄猶膾炙人口。朱趙尤善於現形；軍閥橫暴，弱女委屈，侠士高義，才郎多情種種，不惟霄之於口，抑又現之於形，刻劃入微，頗具話劃色彩。耀祥更善各地方言，是爲他人所不及者。</p>
<p>蔣朱猶似平劇中京朝派，以其守舊法絲毫不苟也。朱趙猶似平劇中海派，以其稍稍改良舊法，並有白話開篇之創作也·沈薜則處二者之聞，說表時間亦雜以新名詞等。</p>
<p>論體態</p>
<p>如庭於業餘嗜足球，現任光裕社足球會會長。介生更擅崑曲，販馬記，春香鬧學爲其代表作。儉安旣敗嗓，時人謂爲麒派說書；俊卿暇時愛唱牛劇，宗相畹華；麒派說書配以梅派票友，洵是韻事。朱趙亦能崑曲，亦能平劇；更能表演話劇。曾在東方話劇團上演桃花扇時演出！</p>
<p>如庭膚蒼黑，介生眇一目。儉安　，筱　肥；耀祥高，稼秋矮。此又六人形體上之異也。而肥者與瘦者配對，高者與矮者相合，泃趣事也！凡上所述，犖犖大者耳，瑣屑之處，限於篇幅，茲不贅述。今春蔣朱息影書壇，沈薛宣吿拆擋，僅朱趙尙能在書塲中聽到，令人不無人事滄桑之感耳！</p>

<h3>血雨瓊葩</h3>
<p>— 頋明道</p>
<p>第九章　憐君何事到天涯</p>
<p>柳隱英姑母在外邊喚道：「客人遠道　來，你理該讓他早些安眠歇息，有話明天再講吧。」柳隱央給他姑母幾句話提醒，遂立起身來說道：「哥哥請安睡，我們明日再行暢談。道裹書室後有一小小臥房，作爲客室，請哥哥將就睡下吧。」許靖道：「甚感雅意。」於是柳隱英點了燭台，引導許靖走到裏間去，果然很是狹小，炕上已安放着許靖的行李，早已代他安排好了。室後又有一扇小門是通到背後廚下去的，此時鬥已　上了。許靖瞧着說道：「很好，室不在大，有炕便足安眠，多謝多謝。」柳隱英將燭台放在炕邊一張小几上，說道：「自己弟兄不必再說客氣話了。明天再會吧。」說畢，回身走小房去。許靖今天無　中遇到了新知，談吐甚是投合，引以爲慰。且覺得柳隱英鏢法旣精，劍術又高，可稱絕技，自己那裹及得到他呢？得交這種朋友，可謂榮幸。所以睡至炕上，再不想起王家被逐的恥辱，而覺得夢魂甜　。一覺醒來，已是天明。起身後，小婢端過臉水來，許靖洗臉，漱口，櫛髪，一一已畢，整了衣冠，走到外邊來。柳隱英已在外邊坐候，同用早餐。這天許靖和柳隱英上午坐談，下午又到嶺上去散步而歸。柳隱英的姑母也是好客情重，大碗酒大塊肉的請許靖吃喝。一住數天，感悄甚是融洽。許靖覺得有些過意不去。他想早些前去王家按照預定的計畫行事，使王永泰明白誰是好人，維是壞人，然後自己再可出面，索性介紹柳隱英至周遇吉將軍麾下一同効力。所以到了第四天的下午，他乘柳隱英不在身邊時，一人獨坐書室中，仰首瞧着承　，思想多時，不由口裹嘆道：「我準這樣做吧，受人之寃，不可不白，也爲他老人家預除禍種，不管他老人家氣惱不氣惱了。（七二）</p>

<h3>Rogers and Others Scheduled to Visit China</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The news that Rogers and Fox, American members of the Stabilization Fund Management Committee, are scheduled to visit China has aroused interest from all parties. Although the Chinese government has not recently issued any statements regarding its legal tender policy, well-informed sources unanimously believe that the exchange rate of the legal tender will be maintained. However, there is currently no intention to raise it, so as to avoid disadvantages to exports. As for imports, there are existing purchasing credit loans and barter agreements available, so there is also no need to raise the exchange rate of the legal tender. Of the three Chinese members of the Management Committee, Chen Guangfu is already in Chongqing, and Xi Demao has recently arrived in Chongqing from Hong Kong. Bei Songsun will also come to Chongqing from Hong Kong in the near future. The establishment of the committee is expected to take place in mid-June. (Havas News Agency, 23rd)</p>

Discussions continued yesterday morning at Kong's official residence, focusing on the details of the new measures. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>Authorities Closely Monitor Food Situation</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The food issue remains under close scrutiny by the authorities. According to Xu Kan, the government has established fundamental and expedient measures. It is reported that Chairman Chiang will report on the food issue at the Central Memorial Week next Monday, at which time the details of the measures will be revealed. Furthermore, today's Central Daily News editorial hopes to implement the land tax in kind and treasury bond plan. This plan was passed by the Eighth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, using treasury bonds to collect surplus grain from landowners, to be repaid with grain upon maturity, with generous interest attached. The original proposal stated that the purpose of this measure was to solve the wartime food supply, strengthen wartime finance, and equalize the wartime financial burden. This may be one of the fundamental measures mentioned by Xu. Furthermore, according to Lu Zuofu's estimation, this year's conversion of land tax to payment in kind in Sichuan province will yield approximately 6.3 million shi of grain. If each landowner purchases an additional 6.3 million shi of treasury bonds in kind, then 12.6 million shi can be obtained, all stored to stabilize the food supply in the rear. In addition, the government should purchase 12.6 million shi with treasury bonds in kind to prepare for emergencies. Lu's intention is that landowners have the surplus capacity to purchase three times the amount of their land tax in kind treasury bonds. (Havas World Telegraph Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Organic Law of the Ministry of Trade is currently under review by the Executive Yuan. This ministry will specialize in foreign trade, while various domestic businesses will continue to be handled by existing agencies. The Ministry of Food was originally scheduled to be established in mid-June, but it has now been postponed to July 1st. At that time, the Food Administration will be abolished. (Havas World Telegraph Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Decides to Establish Fish Farming Areas</h3>

The Executive Yuan has also drafted a plan and handed it over to experts to be responsible for its implementation. At the same time, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has promulgated laws to protect fish and fish eggs. (Havas News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly War Situation</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Military Affairs Commission issued a statement discussing the war situation on various fronts this week (May 16th to 22nd) as follows:</p>
<p>Since the start of the major battle in the Zhongtiao Mountains of Shanxi and Henan, it has been half a month. The danger and intensity of the battle are unprecedented in the northern theater in the past four years. As of the wood day, the Japanese army's deaths around the Zhongtiao Mountains have reached more than 30,000. The Japanese army participating in this campaign, consisting of seven or eight divisions, all considered excellent, has been greatly weakened by this battle. In order to cover up, the Japanese army has fabricated various rumors, which I have already refuted a few days ago. The world should now be able to see through their trickery.</p>
<p>After being attacked by the Chinese army from all sides last week, the Japanese army in northern Hubei retreated towards Zaoyang city. The Chinese army immediately encircled them. On the night of the 16th, the Chinese army bravely attacked the city and captured Zaoyang. The Japanese then suddenly retreated to the left bank of the Shahe River, where they were again ambushed by the Chinese army in Wucaidian, Xiongjiaji, Suiyangdian, and Ji Mountain, resulting in over 2,700 Japanese deaths. The remaining troops attempted to return to Kanghuan Tan Zhen on the night of the 17th, going east from Xinji in three routes. They are currently being intercepted by the Chinese army.</p>
<p>After the Japanese army on the coast of eastern Zhejiang fled to the warships, suffering heavy losses, they sought revenge. The Japanese army in Zhuji gathered over 10,000 troops and adopted a multi-pronged attack along the railway line, attempting to move south and annihilate the Chinese field army. The Chinese frontline commander immediately adopted a strategy of defeating them individually, fiercely attacking the invading Japanese army. On the evening of the 17th, the Japanese army completely collapsed and retreated north. A certain Chinese unit pursued them and captured Huaxisi and Suxikou on the 18th, Chuandai Shi and Huangdai Shi on the 19th. On the evening of the same day, the Chinese vanguard had already crossed the line of Kui Shi, Wang Sha, and Qi Shi and was pressing on the suburbs of Zhuji city. At 3 p.m., they captured Zhuji city. In this battle, over 4,000 Japanese were killed. The Chinese army is still in pursuit.</p>
<p>The Japanese army, numbering approximately 30,000, that invaded eastern Guangdong started on the 9th, and successively invaded Kailuo and Huiyang from Zengcheng, Dongguan, Shenzhen, and Renzhan in multiple directions, attempting to annihilate the Chinese field army. The Chinese knew the Japanese plan and lured the Japanese to the Shanzhou area east of Huiyang, where they launched an encirclement and annihilation battle. By the 16th, they had successively defeated the Japanese army that had advanced to the vicinity of Haoyi Xu. The Chinese took advantage of the victory and pursued them in multiple directions, successively capturing Dadong Xu, Xi Mao Tian, Lianghua Xu, Henggang Xu, Wo Ma Xu, Xiangshui Xu and other strongholds by the morning of the 19th, killing over 3,000 Japanese. At the moment, the Chinese army has already reached the outskirts of Huiyang and Boluo, and the two cities will be captured in a matter of days. In addition, the Japanese who invaded Shidou Jie and Yuanjia Yan south of Pengze and Hukou in northern Jiangxi have been repelled by the Chinese. The Chinese army is still besieging Fuzhou city. Lianjiang was once recaptured by the Chinese. The Japanese army in Sishui, Linze, and Shaman in northern Jiangsu are also being severely annihilated by the Chinese. (Dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Yunnan Provincial Government Rewards Employees of the Yunnan-Burma Road</p>

It was specifically passed at the provincial government meeting to produce and issue gold and silver medals to reward meritorious personnel. (Dispatch of the 23rd)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The United States Will Make a Major Decision</h3>
<p>President Roosevelt is scheduled to deliver his highly anticipated "fireside chat" the day after tomorrow. The day before yesterday, he convened Secretary of State Hull and top military and government officials, such as Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, Secretary of War Stimson, Secretary of the Navy Knox, Lend-Lease Administrator Hopkins, and the Chiefs of Staff of the Army and Navy, to discuss future plans. It is not difficult to guess that it must be related to the speech the day after tomorrow. In recent days, there has been much speculation about the content of the speech. Some say that the President will announce escorting convoys, others say that he will request the amendment of the Neutrality Act, still others say that he will announce a full state of wartime emergency, and yet others say that he will oppose the Axis powers' intrusion into the West Philippines. Regardless of which of the above is correct, there is no doubt that the United States will make a major decision in the coming days.</p>
<p>After suffering setbacks in the Balkans and Libya, Britain was followed by the outbreak of war in the Near East, and the Vichy government declared "Franco-German cooperation." In this situation, with the attitudes of the Soviet Union and Turkey ambiguous, the situation in Crete precarious, and the Near East and the Suez Canal feeling threatened, the British Empire's situation has indeed reached a very serious stage. If any more twists and turns occur in the Atlantic or the western Mediterranean, the British authorities will face an unprecedented dangerous juncture. In this situation, the United States, whose mission is to safeguard the victory of democratic countries, will not only fail to live up to its obligations, but also face the imminent crisis of having to personally deal with the Axis powers' flames extending to the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Looking at the recent movements of the United States, its persistent and active attitude has already been clearly demonstrated. Considering only the actions of the past two or three days, there has been the passage of the "Special Fleet" bill by the House Naval Affairs Committee, as well as the joint resolution of the House and Senate on the confiscation of Axis ships. Secretary of the Navy Knox did not hesitate to firmly advocate yesterday that the United States must be prepared to make sacrifices "worthy of its predecessors," while the War Department requested that the people donate 200,000 pints of blood for emergency use by soldiers and civilians during wartime. All of this is enough to show that the United States is preparing for the worst-case scenario. However, in contrast to the current war situation, these preparations are still insufficient to alleviate "Britain's urgent needs"! Because all bills are either still in the legislative process or have just been passed and are far from being effectively utilized. As for the speeches of cabinet members, they are mostly familiar and do not provide timely help, or they are difficult to turn into immediate action. What Britain needs now is immediate and practical assistance, not verbal encouragement that does not materialize. This is why freedom-loving people around the world are eagerly awaiting President Roosevelt's "chat," because Roosevelt is the head of the United States, whose words carry great weight and who dares to speak and act. Based on past events, each time he speaks, he is able to provide very specific insights. This time, as he is speaking at a time when Britain is feeling desperate, it is believed that he will not disappoint the public and will announce more specific and powerful decisions, at the very least, he will fulfill his promise to "send war equipment to Britain."</p>
<p>At this time, the Axis powers' Far Eastern allies may still be fantasizing about taking advantage of the United States' imminent involvement in the Atlantic to find some exploitable "gaps" to facilitate their selfish ambitions to dominate East Asia. Unfortunately, reviewing yesterday's American cables, on the one hand, Democratic Senator Lee rebuked isolationists for "injecting deadly appeasement poison into the muscles of national defense," and on the other hand, Congressman Weiss advocated banning oil shipments to Japan. Given President Roosevelt's words and actions over the past eight and a half years, there is no reason to believe that he will "change his tune" midway. Therefore, it can be confidently asserted that in his speech the day after tomorrow, he will reaffirm his consistent uncompromising attitude to clear up some of the gray reports that have been circulating in the Far East in the past few days.</p>
<p>Someone said: In this early summer season, it is still a rather meaningful joke to use the phrase "fireside chat."</p>
<h3>American Ambassador Gauss Scheduled to Present Credentials Tomorrow, Counselor Butrick to Go to Beiping in a Month to Manage Affairs of the Embassy's Office in Beiping</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The new American Ambassador to China, Gauss, is scheduled to present his credentials to Chairman Lin of the National Government on the afternoon of Monday, May 26th. The American Ambassador arrived in Chongqing from Hong Kong on the 22nd with Embassy Counselor Butrick. After a month's stay in Chongqing, Butrick will go to Peiping to be responsible for the affairs of the American Embassy's office in Peiping. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Beiping: The 70-man guard of the American Embassy in Beiping is due to be replaced. They left for Qinhuangdao by train on Thursday night and yesterday, and will embark on the American military transport ship Hunterson to return to their country. It is reported that only technical service personnel will be added, numbering around a dozen. The average number of the American Embassy guard has recently been around 200. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>Disaster Relief Committee Relief for Refugees in Zhejiang and Fujian</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Recently, the Japanese army has harassed Fujian and Zhejiang and bombed rear cities. The government is concerned about the refugees and has implemented relief measures. It is reported that the Disaster Relief Committee has specially allocated an additional 500,000 yuan for emergency relief in Zhejiang, which will be managed by Qu Yingguang, the vice-chairman of the committee, in coordination with the provincial government. Previously, the committee allocated 500,000 yuan for price stabilization in Fujian, and a large amount of food has been purchased in Guangze, Jiangxi and shipped to the province. In Chengdu, Xi'an, Luoyang, Lanzhou, and other places that have been bombed in recent days, the committee has allocated funds to rush relief efforts. It is estimated that 50,000 yuan has been allocated to Chengdu, 100,000 yuan to Luoyang, and special funds have been allocated from the allocated air raid relief reserve funds for Lanzhou and Xi'an to be handled together.

<p>Resources Committee: Memorial Service for Xiao Zhizhi</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Resources Committee held a memorial service on the 23rd for Xiao Zhizhi, the deceased chemical engineer of the committee. Over 200 people attended, including Weng Wenhao and Qian Changzhao. During the meeting, Weng and others gave speeches, praising Xiao's serious scholarship and rigorous work spirit. They unanimously believed that his death at a young age was a loss to the country. Xiao was an authority on domestic oil refining. Last spring, he was ordered to go to the United States to design and supervise the manufacturing of oil refining machinery. He fell ill due to overwork and died on April 16th at the age of only 33. It is reported that Mr. Bin, who jointly researched with Xiao, is also a mature expert and went to the United States at the same time as Xiao. He has not yet returned. Xiao's unfinished business will be continued by Mr. Bin. (Dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Sichuan Has Seasonable Rainfall and Harvest is Promising</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to a report from the Production Increase Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, all counties in Sichuan Province had timely rain in late May. Rainfall in other provinces was also seasonable. Local soldiers and civilians are now busy transplanting rice seedlings, and a good harvest can be predicted. In addition, the Food Production Increase Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry reported that various provinces are working hard to promote improved rice varieties. According to reports from various provinces, this year, Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi and other provinces have expanded the area of improved rice varieties to over 2 million mu, and all have completed transplanting rice seedlings one after another. It is estimated that this one task can increase rice production by 1.2 million dan. (Dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to Great Britain, Shigemitsu, Summoned Back Home, United States to Continue Economic Measures to Prevent Supply of Coal and Oil to Japan</h3>
<p>London: Japanese Ambassador to London, Mamoru Shigemitsu, was ordered yesterday to fly back to Tokyo to discuss matters with the government. Shigemitsu had originally planned to meet with Matsuoka en route to Europe, but was unable to meet him due to Matsuoka's hurried return to Tokyo. It is believed here that Shigemitsu may have something to say about the possibility of the United States returning to Japan. When Shigemitsu visited British Undersecretary Butler, he told him that he was about to return to his country and assured him that this trip would not harm Anglo-Japanese relations. Therefore, it cannot be considered a prelude to the severance of relations between the two countries. (Associated Press, 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: A government spokesperson today responded to questions regarding the recall of Japanese Ambassador to Great Britain Shigemitsu, saying that the ambassador's plan to return home was only to report to the government. The ambassador had wanted to meet with Matsuoka while he was touring Europe, but this did not happen because the British had reservations about it. The ambassador has been stationed in Britain for more than three years. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Government and business leaders in Japan are closely watching attempts by American lawmakers to persuade President Roosevelt to continue taking economic measures against Japan. The United States will prevent the supply of coal and oil to Japan. The "Reading News" declared that if this plan is indeed implemented, then US-Japan relations will become tense again. (Haitong, 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The National News declared today that if the United States goes to war with Germany, Japan "should take steps to actually attack the United States." The conclusion of the Tripartite Pact lies in "building a fair and reasonable new world order" and indirectly in the happiness of mankind in the world, preventing the United States from entering the war. It also stated that Japan should fully fulfill its mission. (Associated Press, 24th)</p>

<h3>German Artillery Units Land from the Air 克里特恶战进行中 British Hold Positions East of Maleme Heraklion, an Important Port, Reported Recaptured</h3>
<p>Cairo – The Maleme airfield is still in German hands. They continued landing troops there yesterday, as well as artillery units, including large field guns and mortars. British forces are currently holding positions east of the Maleme airfield, and fierce fighting is underway. (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London – There is no sign of the enemy in the cities and airfields of Crete. Supplies dropped by the Germans are being collected by the British. The situation in Maleme is not very favorable. As far as London knows, the British Navy has scattered an enemy convoy. From a naval perspective, the recapture of Heraklion is extremely important, as it is one of the good ports for landing supplies. (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London – Cairo officials announced last night that Allied forces on the island of Crete counterattacked Maleme with some success, but due to the large number of enemy reinforcements transported by air and landed in the area, the Allied counterattack failed to fully develop. The battle situations in Heraklion and Rethymno are satisfactory, and fighting continues. According to the latest news from Crete received in Cairo, the battle situation remains unchanged, and fierce fighting is in progress. The Germans are trying to use their old trick of occupying a point and then holding it firmly. Some German soldiers are carrying automatic weapons and even small mortars, digging trenches and fighting from them, making it difficult for Allied forces to dislodge them. The fighting around the Maleme airfield is fierce, and the Germans are trying to use the airfield to land more troops. However, the Germans have expended a large amount of ammunition in repelling Allied attacks, so it seems doubtful whether they can continue to sustain this firepower for long. British and Greek troops are still holding the coast, repelling enemy landing attempts. The British Middle East Command issued a communiqué last night stating that Crete was again subjected to heavy attacks yesterday (Thursday), which continued throughout the day. The Germans continued to send planes to transport paratroopers and troops to land on the island. The enemy forces gained temporary footholds in Heraklion and Rethymno, but suffered heavy casualties after fierce hand-to-hand combat. The battle situation in both places is now quite satisfactory. The British counterattack in the Maleme area had some success but was subsequently thwarted by enemy reinforcements. Fighting is continuing, and the Germans have suffered many casualties, indicating that the British have achieved military success. British forces in Heraklion are also fighting very bravely. (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London – According to the latest news from the island of Crete, Allied forces have driven the Germans out of all key points after fierce hand-to-hand combat, with the exception of Maleme. Allied forces have also controlled the entire coast of the island. German soldiers landing by parachute or transport plane are still restricted. The Germans in Heraklion and Rethymno have been driven out by Allied forces, and the situation in both places has now improved. The Germans in Maleme, a few miles west of Souda Bay, have occupied an area on the airfield, allowing German planes to land, but the airfield is constantly under attack by Allied artillery fire, and fierce fighting is still in progress. German planes are still transporting troops to land in various parts of Crete, but they are all being fiercely attacked by the combined Australian, New Zealand, British, and Greek forces, being either killed or captured. Allied anti-aircraft guns have been very successful in night combat. Last night's communiqué stated that since the Germans began their invasion of Crete, at least sixteen of their transport planes have been shot down, and many large ground transport planes have also been destroyed. A large number of paratroopers have been killed or wounded upon landing. The total number of enemy casualties is now increasing significantly, while Allied casualties are not heavy, and enemy convoys attempting to transport troops to Crete have also been destroyed or heavily damaged, escaping back to their bases. (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Heavy German Casualties in Failed Nighttime Landing Attempt</h3>
<p>Alexandria – The British Navy fiercely attacked a German fleet attempting to land troops on Crete under cover of darkness early Thursday morning, inflicting heavy losses on the German ships. The bodies of German soldiers killed and drowned were floating in the sea in unknown numbers. The reporter has just learned the story of this all-night naval battle. At the time, the British fleet inflicted heavy damage on the German ships with relentless fire. Some of the damaged German ships were engulfed in flames, with countless German soldiers screaming for help, while others sank and drowned. British naval officers and the fleet were forced to pass through waters filled with corpses as they proceeded to destroy the last German ship. A captain of a British cruiser told the reporter that this decisive battle could be described as a "massacre," and that "we arrived at the scene of the battle around midnight on Wednesday, expecting the enemy to try to land by sea to reinforce the German troops who had already arrived on the island by air." He also described how they passed a destroyer, whose nationality was difficult to determine, but a searchlight from one of our ships was immediately shone, and the destroyer fired a torpedo at our ship, which missed. It was strange that the enemy's firing seemed very slow. We subsequently identified the ship as Italian, and it was soon destroyed. The ship was escorting a German troop transport and forty Greek fishing boats, carrying a total of four thousand soldiers. After the destroyer was destroyed, these four thousand soldiers also perished at the bottom of the sea. The British cruiser captain also said that after the Italian destroyer was destroyed, our fleet, about several cruisers, under the cover of destroyers, advanced along the north coast. After the destroyed Italian ship, we saw a German transport ship of about one thousand tons, which we bombarded with artillery. The sound of the cannons was deafening, and the German ship suffered the same fate as the Italian ship. After that, it was the turn of the poor small boats, and our artillery fire was very fierce, sinking these boats in rows. He estimated that each of these boats carried about one hundred people, and the transport ship carried two thousand people, so he believed that about six thousand Germans were drowned in this decisive naval battle.

<p>Alexandria – A Reuters correspondent with the British Mediterranean Fleet reports that on the night of May 21, the night was pitch black. The enemy, using many sailing ships and small merchant ships, escorted by an Italian destroyer, made the first attempt to land troops on Crete in the dead of night. There were a total of forty sailing ships, each carrying hundreds of soldiers, and several small merchant ships, each carrying hundreds of soldiers. The British fleet was patrolling east of Crete when it spotted the enemy ships and attacked them with four-inch guns and rapid-firing guns. The enemy ships sank one after another, and some caught fire and burned. Thousands of enemy soldiers cried for help in the sea, but because submarines were lurking nearby, the British fleet could not stay long to rescue them. The battle lasted about three hours, after which the British fleet returned safely to its defense and carried an Italian flag picked up from the sea. (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wooden Man Falls From Sky Nazi Deceptions Abound</h3>
<p>London – Another battlefield report states that the Germans have dropped wooden dummies by parachute onto Crete. Although the purpose of this move is not very clear, it may be intended to entice British forces to waste bullets by shooting at the dummies. So far, the Germans have not landed any small airborne tanks, as Front has discovered. The German High Command communiqué still does not mention the invasion of Crete. The communiqué only mentions the fighting in the Eastern Mediterranean, stating that some German air squadrons attacked British warships, sinking or destroying several of them.

<h3>Paratroopers Arrive in Droves Like Locusts Filling the Sky</h3>
<p>Although British troops on the island of Crete are harassed by German planes, they are still bravely fighting the German paratroopers, who have suffered heavy losses. However, reinforcements of paratroopers are flying in continuously, jumping down one after another, like locusts filling the sky. They have gained a foothold in more than one place, which is unavoidable. However, the Germans will undoubtedly try again to break through the blockade line in order to transport supplies to the enemy forces arriving from the air. Regarding British reinforcements, it should be noted that when reinforcements land, they will inevitably be subjected to reckless strafing attacks by German planes. (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin – The High Command announced today that German Air Force Captain Groete died while leading a squadron of planes in operations against the British. (24th United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fighting Concentrated in Four Key Points British Use Tanks to Control the Enemy</h3>
<p>Cairo – A military spokesman here reviewed the battle situation on the island of Crete last night, stating that the overall situation, except for Maleme, is quite good, and fierce fighting is continuing. The two armies are mostly using light and heavy machine guns and mortars in combat, and the Allied forces are also using tanks and hand grenades. There is no sign that the Germans have landed any tanks or motor vehicles. The fighting is concentrated in four key points, namely Heraklion, Rethymno, Chania, and Maleme. Fierce fighting has broken out at the airfield in Maleme, a few miles west of Chania, and the situation is uncertain. The enemy has occupied enough land to land planes, but the airfield is repeatedly attacked by Allied artillery fire, with each side having its own victories and defeats, so it is difficult to predict the outcome of the fighting in Maleme. There is still a possibility that the enemy will be driven out of the airfield. The enemy has no way to land from the sea. The battle situation on Crete is now chaotic, and no German airborne division has landed intact and unscathed. The German tactic is to transport troops to various locations and land them continuously, but the only place they have gained is the Maleme airfield. When asked whether the Allied forces are being hampered by the lack of air support, the spokesman replied that when the Allied forces are subjected to strafing and bombing without seeing their own planes, they inevitably feel the impact of the lack of air support. However, strafing and bombing are not as effective against troops in deep trenches as they are against troops in retreat. (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Review Battle Situation Victory or Defeat Still Difficult to Predict</h3>
<p>London – A Times editorial on the battle of Crete states that the enemy is disregarding its heavy losses because it believes that Crete is worth sacrificing to capture. The importance of the island to the defense of Egypt and the freedom of action of the British Navy in the Eastern Mediterranean is self-evident at this time. If the island were to fall, the maintenance of the British Mediterranean Fleet in Alexandria would not be greatly affected, but various operations of the British Navy would be seriously hindered, and the danger to Admiral Cunningham (Commander-in-Chief of the British Mediterranean Fleet) would increase. Since the British have been able to prevent enemy artillery and tanks from being transported to Crete, the garrison on the island still has high hopes of overcoming the enemy's superior numbers in this fierce battle.

<h3>London Organizes Free Italian Battalion United World Anti-Fascist Comrades Seek to Restore the Old Glory of the Nation</h3>
<p>London – Recently, the Free Italian Committee has been organized in London to unite Italians around the world to oppose Fascism. The committee has drafted a plan to organize a "Free Italian Battalion." Under the leadership of Bettroni, who voluntarily left Italy, the committee has devised a plan to gather Italians in the Americas and other parts of the world to fight against Fascism. Bettroni claims that he has received hints from the Mancini Society in the United States, which uses "Freedom and Honor" as its slogan, that it may cooperate with this movement, and countless Italians around the world have already signed up to participate. Bettroni is from southern Italy and lost an arm due to his participation in organizing farmers' cooperatives and the incidents that followed. After the Munich Agreement was signed in 1938, he left Italy.</p>
<h3>Mr. Bettroni Publishes a Letter</h3>
<p>Bettroni, in his capacity as secretary of the Free Italian Committee, wrote a letter to the London Times, explaining the purpose of the group. The letter states, "The powerful blow that Mussolini's empire has taken in Africa makes one consider the possible effects of this victory. When and how will the war situation have repercussions on the internal political structure of the nation? What can replace Fascism? The formation of the Free Italian Committee is motivated by these two questions, and the committee is therefore studying the conditions suitable for organizing a government to succeed Fascism. The purpose of the committee is to unite Italians who oppose dictatorship and sympathize with the Allied countries, regardless of whether they are left-wing or right-wing, and to organize a government managed by the people and for the welfare of all classes of society, to restore the civil liberties of Italy, to restore the national honor of Italy that has been damaged by its aggressive policies, to restore the political and cultural autonomy of Italy that has been sacrificed by its alliance with foreign countries, and to prepare Italy for its new position in the post-Allied victory era. The committee is well aware that the Italian people themselves have many reasons why they cannot break free from the shackles that oppress them, so the committee will do its best to obtain and adjust the assistance that millions of compatriots abroad can give them."

<h3>Greek Minister of the Interior Encourages the People to Fight Valiantly with the British to Win the Final Victory</h3>
<p>London – The Greek Minister of the Interior recently issued the following document to the free Greek people: "Our battle against the German army, which began two days ago on this heroic island, is proceeding smoothly. The soldiers of our brave ally, Great Britain, are closely united with the Greek and Cretan soldiers, and are now achieving brilliant victories. Citizens, be encouraged to meet the enemy. We are fighting now, and will continue to fight until we achieve final victory. May God save the free people." (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Berlin Claims Three British Warships Further Sunk by German Air Force</h3>
<p>Berlin – German planes yesterday sank two destroyers of the British Mediterranean Fleet, and two more were severely damaged, one of which is burning. Five motor torpedo boats were also sunk. According to German reconnaissance planes, two destroyers are burning after being bombed by German planes. (24th Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>London – A British Middle East Air Force communiqué states that two enemy dive bombers attempting to attack British ships in the Mediterranean were shot down by British fighters. (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin – May 23 will become a "black day" in British history as of four British ships having been sunk off the coast of Crete. That area of the sea is an important route for Britain to reach the Near East and Egypt. Now that it has been controlled by the German Air Force, the passage of British fleets or convoys will require major sacrifices. In addition to sinking four ships this time, six more were severely damaged, including two heavy battleships, which were hit by the largest type of bombs. German planes have a long range, reaching as far as Greenland and the coast of West Africa. British merchant fleets are often sunk in part. German submarines have recently sunk another 110,300 tons of British shipping, including three oil tankers totaling 31,000 tons. The British have lost 91,000 tons of oil tankers this month. In other words, the British lost a total of 127,000 tons of fuel in three weeks this month. (24th Haitong dispatch)</p>

<h3>US Secretary of the Navy Officially Declares Will Fight Again for Freedom Roosevelt and Hull Confer Hope to Revise or Cancel Neutrality Act</h3>
<p>Washington – Secretary of the Navy Knox declared yesterday that the United States must prepare to make sacrifices "comparable to those made by our predecessors," and that "it is not easy for us to overcome the current events in the world. We have fought twice before for purpose, so it is important for us to now retake this purpose." At the same time, other government leaders are asking the president to declare a full state of emergency, and the Senate and the War Department are taking further measures to place the United States on a state of emergency footing in terms of politics, military affairs, and industry. Senator Lee, a Democrat from Oklahoma, urged the government to declare a full wartime state of emergency, because, according to him, isolationists have injected a fatal dose of appeasement poison into the muscles of national defense. Lee declared that General Wood of the America First Committee should change the name of his committee to the "Aid Hitler Committee." The Senate unanimously passed a bill authorizing the government to control industry. This would give the president the power to suspend the production of daily necessities in order to accelerate production for the Army and Navy. The bill has been sent to the White House for signature. The Senate also unanimously approved authorizing the Commercial Credit Corporation to collect cotton under government loans in 1940 and earlier, temporarily suspending its commercial trading until after the war. The War Department is asking the people to donate 30 million pints of blood for military and public emergencies during wartime, and has authorized the American Red Cross to handle voluntary blood transfusions. Secretary Knox gave a speech at a meeting of the Naval Construction Society, at which British Ambassador to Washington Lord Halifax was also present. Secretary Knox, facing the British Ambassador, said, "If we do not share in the war against the enslavement of mankind, may God help and forgive us. This decisive war is a struggle for control of the sea. Any country that does not have a combined naval and air force cannot gain a position to dominate the world. We are going to put aside bookkeeping and work for the common good. We are going to donate a part of our property before we are defeated." (24th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington – House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom stated last night that if government officials indicate a need to amend all or part of the Neutrality Act, the Foreign Affairs Committee is prepared to discuss it immediately. He has planned to hold meetings with Secretary of the Navy Knox, Secretary of War Stimson, and Secretary of State Hull as soon as possible. (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>New York – The New York Times recently published a dispatch from a correspondent in Washington stating that President Roosevelt and his aides hope that the Senate and House of Representatives will amend or even repeal the current Neutrality Act in order to resolve the British military supply problem. President Roosevelt stopped all work yesterday and only met with Secretary of State Hull, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, Secretary of War Stimson, Secretary of the Navy Knox, Army Chief of Staff General Marshall, Navy Chief of Staff Admiral Stark, and Hopkins, who is responsible for implementing the Lend-Lease Act, to discuss the content of the speech. Recently, the Secretaries of the Navy and War have successively made impassioned speeches criticizing the Neutrality Act, indicating that the authorities have carefully considered this issue. The New York Times also published an article written by isolationist Congressman Fish, which stated, "Knox and Stimson are doing everything they can to draw the American people into the vortex of war. According to the provisions of the Neutrality Act, American ships cannot sail to war zones. The ability of the United States to stay out of the war is due to this." (23rd Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>US President to Deliver Important Speech the Day After Tomorrow: Expanding the Scope of the Monroe Doctrine, Treating Nazi Submarines as Pirates</h3>
<p>Washington: It is widely expected that President Roosevelt will deliver a very important speech on May 27th, addressing fifty million Allied listeners, explaining the serious dangers the United States would face if the Atlantic war were unfavorable to the Allied countries, and the reasons why the United States must defend the entire hemisphere in order to defend itself, thus expanding the Monroe Doctrine to the Eastern Atlantic and to the protruding part of West Africa. He may also announce that Nazi submarines are to be treated as pirates and dealt with accordingly. What the President will say is, of course, currently only known to the President himself and his close aides; this is a highly confidential matter. However, the general public speculates that what the President will say will not deviate from the path recently advocated by Secretary of the Navy Knox, Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of War Stimson, and Secretary of Agriculture Wickard. These individuals have all spoken of the imminent national crisis and the necessity of sending US war materials to the British, and their remarks were all first approved by the President. After repeatedly examining the arguments of these individuals, one can get a glimpse of what the President will say on the 27th. The Secretaries of the Navy and War have both recently advocated for the abolition of the Neutrality Act, leading many to believe that the President will also elaborate on the necessity of abolishing this law. However, well-informed sources say that such a grand move is relatively secondary and could provoke endless debates in Congress and delaying actions by isolationists at this critical time. Therefore, it is expected that the President will not seek this option but will take other steps based on his authority as Commander-in-Chief and then seek congressional approval afterward. Some people have recently said that the President does not favor convoys because convoys mean opening fire, and opening fire means opening war. The President has another plan to strike at submarines, and its effectiveness is no less than that of convoys. Could treating submarines as pirates be an explanation of this plan? The possibility of extending the Monroe Doctrine to include the entire Atlantic and to the protruding part of West Africa originated from the opinions of the government's naval and land advisors. They believe that the effective defense of the United States depends on the defense of the entire hemisphere. If a line from British territorial waters through Dakar to the south is not occupied by the United States or friendly countries, South America will be vulnerable to attack from many points. It is expected that the President's speech will present this as the government's view, and this necessary action is now even more necessary because Vichy has apparently offered its territory for German use. Currently, American newspapers do not speculate much about the content of the President's speech, but its importance is widely recognized. What will be delivered on the 27th will likely be an important milestone in American history and foreign policy. The seriousness of the situation is now more clearly understood, and the American people's awareness of the crisis is largely due to Vichy Deputy Prime Minister Darlan's agreement with Germany. In fact, the psychological shock suffered by Americans since the fall of France a year ago has been greater than anything else. Observing the general sentiment, it is felt that any steps decided by the President will definitely receive the support of the majority of Americans. Many now believe that May 27th will be a date to be commemorated in the calendars of all democratic countries for many years to come. (Reuter's dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that he would submit a periodic report on the Lend-Lease Act to Congress on June 10th or 11th, at which time he would list the prices of items sent to democratic countries, but he would not disclose the details. The President's response to the possibility of amending the Neutrality Act was evasive, and his statements on the international situation were also cautious. (United Press dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>German Submarines Appear in US Patrol Zone</p>
<p>London: British naval commentators declared today that Britain's drastic countermeasures have forced German submarines to operate in the more western American neutral patrol zone in the Atlantic in recent weeks. The naval correspondent of the Daily Sketch declared, "There is no reason for excessive optimism, but the Admiralty's efforts to reduce the loss of our ships have made the enemy concerned about the war in the Atlantic and unable to cut off our necessary supplies as they expected." The Daily News reporter Aston said, "The appearance of German submarines in the US patrol zone greatly helps our submarine hunting because although US ships do not attack German submarines, they can notify our ships of the submarines' locations." Other commentators pointed out that German submarines have to make longer voyages to reach their areas of operation, so the danger period for merchant ships is also shorter.

<p>Two Million American Women Support Full Aid to Britain</p>

Undersecretary of State Berle said at the meeting of the Women's Clubs, "The United States must take action in this emergency because we have encountered a European country that has ambitions to dominate the world's naval and land power, and now this kind of ambition to dominate is gradually approaching the New World, but we are confident that our strength and skills can be mobilized at any time in any place because this strength is the only way to protect our safety."

<p>Cairo: Colonel Collet, one of the famous French generals in Syria, has, along with several other French people, left Syria for Transjordan. This was confirmed here last night because Colonel Collet has published an article announcing his willingness to join the Free French forces and denouncing Vichy's policy of supplying Iraq with military equipment.

The telegram stated, "Colonel Collet, the commander of the Syrian military, used the pretext of maneuvers to mobilize troops, intending to take them across the border to join the British forces in Transjordan. However, the majority of the Syrian soldiers fled back to Syria. The Syrian soldiers who left the country with Colonel Collet were surrounded and arrested by border troops.

<p>British Newspaper Warns of Vichy's Policy Errors</p>
<p>London: The "Daily Telegraph" commented on Foreign Secretary Eden's warning to Vichy, saying that if Vichy does not change its policies, then there will inevitably be no way to differentiate between occupied and non-occupied areas, and it should be done quickly. The Vichy government may prevent Eden's remarks in the House of Commons on Thursday from reaching the French public, so Britain should find ways to disseminate the Foreign Secretary's warning among the French public. Because not recognizing the Vichy oligarchy as the democratically elected government of France can promote the distinction between the French people and those in France who claim to be in power. The "Daily Mail" said that no matter what happens, it will be the French people who suffer, and British emotions tend to pity rather than hatred. Britain must, in various ways, make this clear to the French people. Anything that can prevent open hostilities between Britain and France should be done by Britain and the United States to the fullest extent. If, unfortunately, this strange change occurs, then the French people must know that the one who is dropping the bombs is Vichy Deputy Prime Minister Darlan. (Reuter's dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<h3>Grain: Rice from Two Concessions Arrives Steadily, Rice Market Still Not on Normal Track</h3>
<p>Yangmi (foreign rice) continued to arrive in Shanghai from the Municipal Council. The Ming Sheng ship of Yichang Foreign Company, loaded with 10,000 bags of yangmi purchased and sold by the Municipal Council from Hong Kong, arrived in Shanghai at around 1:00 PM yesterday and docked at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. The Xia Fei mail ship of French company, loaded with 3,600 tons of yangmi from Saigon, is expected to arrive today. (Zu)</p>
<p>Yesterday, yangmi market initially fell then rose, fluctuating by two or three yuan throughout the day. However, the final closing price was only slightly higher than the previous night, with a slight increase of a few cents to about one yuan. The rice market is hesitant to rise or fall before the festival, and may need to go through a period of fluctuation before returning to normal, with normal ups and downs. The opening price in the morning was weak due to the weakness of the previous night, and selling sentiment was strong. Both spot and futures rice prices fell by a small two or three yuan. Subsequently, because inland merchants, Japanese merchants, and villagers in the street were all taking advantage of the low prices to buy, the market suddenly became prosperous. The selling prices of yangmi at various stalls immediately rebounded gradually. The situation in the afternoon was still tight, but there was no significant increase or decrease. Yinghua Company No. 1 Saigon was at a low of 139 yuan, a mid-range of 140 yuan, and a high of 141 yuan. Small bran was at 132-133 yuan, broken rice was at a low of 100 yuan, and a high of 102-103 yuan. Spot rice small bran that can be re-exported rose from 108.5 yuan to 111-112 yuan. Municipal Council small bran ranged from 101 yuan to 103 yuan, and Saigon No. 1 ranged from 115 yuan to 118 yuan. The total transaction volume for spot rice was 20,000 bags, and more than 1,000 tons for Yinghua Company.</p>
<p>Owners of thick and thin japonica and other domestic rice still held onto their goods due to scarcity. Local shops and villagers were generally normal, but wholesale buyers found the market more active. Therefore, the prices were not much changed between the fluctuations in yangmi. Wuxi fresh japonica was still 134 yuan, Kunshan fresh japonica was 132 yuan, Zhongguan was at 127-128 yuan, Nangang early and late rice fresh special was 132 yuan, ordinary fresh was 130 yuan, secondary to old was 125 yuan, original package fresh was 135 yuan, ordinary was 132 yuan, 130 yuan.</p>
<p>After a batch of domestic glutinous rice was sold at a low price in the previous dynasty, the impact made it difficult to sell high-quality goods. The outlets for food stalls and cake shops were also sluggish, resulting in owners being willing to sell at a looser price. As a result, the price fell by one or two yuan. Hong Kong special round grain opened at 112 yuan, ordinary at 110 yuan, 108-109 yuan, glutinous tea special issue at 100 yuan, 99 yuan, Zhongguan at 95-96 yuan, domestic glutinous rice unopened.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains: Oil Bean Transactions Sharply Reduced</p>
<p>Yesterday, the noise in the miscellaneous grains and oil cake market was reduced by half, because the actual sales of various items were flat. Speculative football trading became more restrained as the Dragon Boat Festival approached. Therefore, the overall trend was still fluctuating. Various prices only rose or fell by two or three cents. The total transaction volume was 65 barrels of Dalian soybean oil at a price of 178 yuan original plate, 230 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil at 118 yuan, 700 cans of Yanshi canned raw oil at 155.5 yuan, and more than 2,000 bags of Guide soybeans at 45.5 yuan, followed by 44.8 yuan. Other corn opened at 2,000 bags, and Qingdou cake at 1,000 pieces, Shenji futures cake at 20,000 pieces.</p>

In the end, both the British exchange and the US exchange were the same as the closing price of the previous day.

Calculated to charge 23.75%, the speculators rushed to block out the May and June American dollars five units four three seven five, but the gold sets came in at the same price, and Hua Bank also had an absorbing appetite, so the looseness was not easy to unfold, the closing spot to the June term were all British exchanges three office staff three one two five, and the American dollars were five yuan four zero six two five, which were both the same as the closing price of the previous day.</p>

<h3>Reasons for the Decline in Exchange Remittance Surcharge</h3>
<p>The surcharge for exchange remittance in this city has recently fallen to about one yuan per thousand yuan, which is very different from the previous surcharge of more than two hundred yuan per thousand yuan. The reason for the decline is that there are more funds flowing into Shanghai from foreign ports, especially from Tianjin. Due to the favorable exchange rates, the amount remitted has reached tens of millions of yuan. In addition, the foreign exchange in this city has been lengthened, and many people who previously purchased and stored foreign exchange and foreign currencies have sold them and converted them into legal tender. Part of the Chinese merchant banks, because the bank joint reserve committee, in addition to reducing interest rates for drawing account customers, also stipulates quotas, and interest is not calculated for amounts exceeding the quota. At the same time, foreign merchant banks notified Chinese merchant banks to reduce the amount, and it was also heard that a certain foreign merchant bank not only did not pay interest on deposits from Chinese merchant banks, but also charged handling fees if they exceeded the prescribed deposit amount. Therefore, the use of drawing accounts has been reduced, and part of the Chinese merchant banks are not willing to accept large drawing account deposits to avoid interest costs. As for exchange remittance deposits, interest is calculated monthly according to the market rate and there is no limit, and exchange remittance has collateral, which is stable and reliable, so many people convert legal tender into exchange remittance so that they do not lose interest. From this point of view, legal tender and exchange remittance can be exchanged at par, and it is possible that exchange remittance will increase in the future, which is also a constant thing in life.

<h3>Coal: Factory Worries About Coal Briquette Price Drop - Buy When Cheap -</h3>
<p>Coal briquette prices, because of the drop of white coal, the hoarders were afraid of affecting the coal factory, so they hurried to get rid of the old stocks. The Chinese LIZHONG coal company once asked for 170 yuan, but because the factories absorbed the cheap coal, the market was shaken up. But the big factory lacked stocks extremely. But could withstand 296 yuan price. If there will be more source and lower water fee, it may be cheaper.</p>
<h3>Bank (3)</h3>
<p>As for why the Ministry of Revenue did not handle the banking business itself at that time, but had to have Sheng Xuanhuai do it, it can also be seen in this memorial. It said:</p>
<p>"As for banks, they are modeled after the West, and they are the hub for benefiting commerce and industry, not just for taking interest, and certainly not just for creating a granary. The atmosphere in China has not yet opened up, and the ticket offices and money shops in the capital are all funded by merchants themselves, and have not received official support, so their strength is very weak; and HSBC, the Russo-Chinese Bank, and other banks have successively set up in the capital, and have been able to monopolize our great profits. If an official bank is opened first in the area where all directions converge, as an initiative for the provinces, it can connect the arteries of Chinese merchants internally, and prevent the coercion of foreign merchants externally, and the benefits will certainly not be small. However, official shares are not easy to raise, commercial shares are not easy to attract, and there is even more fear that the manager will not be the right person, and the disadvantages will be seen before the benefits are realized. This is another difficulty in establishing a bank."</p>
<p>When the China Commercial Bank was established, its credibility was not yet established, and the banknotes it issued were not valued by the world, and could not circulate freely. Therefore, on the one hand, foreigners were hired as managers in order to connect with foreign banks, and they also joined the Foreign Merchants' Banking Association. On the other hand, money shop owners with considerable status were hired as managers. At that time, it was still the era when the money industry dominated, but because it was affected by the influx of foreign goods, causing silver to flow out, people gave it to foreign merchant banks; and they were able to use it to manipulate our finances and oppress Chinese merchants. However, when it came to the export season, Chinese merchants' funds were ample, and foreign banks sometimes relied on the Chinese merchants. Moreover, the remittance drafts of money shops were of unlimited nature, and foreign banks accepted a money shop ticket without suspicion; while Chinese banks were mostly of a limited nature. When they first opened, foreign banks did not trust them as much as they trusted the notes of the money industry. As long as the money industry was willing to collect and deliver banknotes issued by the bank, they could circulate in the market. Not only was this the case in the late Qing Dynasty, but even before the tenth year of the Republic of China, whenever a bank was opened, it was necessary to recruit one or two veterans from the money industry to manage the business. Therefore, Sheng Xuanhuai immediately invited Xie Lunhui, a director of the money industry, to serve as manager. Xie then said to Sheng, "Today's China Commercial Bank is already a sham in terms of capital, but real in terms of profits. From now on, only by not touching any more bank funds can we take over." Sheng nodded in agreement. The so-called sham capital but real profits means that the capital has already been used, but the profits must be paid in real terms.</p>
<p>Someone asked Xie about the method of running a bank, and Xie answered with one sentence, saying "The forehead of a dead person." It means that in handling bank affairs, there must be no carelessness, and one must follow the rules and regulations, and do it as rigidly as the hard bandages on the forehead of a dead person. When asked how a bank could be run well, Xie said, "Foreign money is always in front of your eyes." The meaning of the bold words, although not as extreme as the slang saying "turning somersaults in the eyes of copper coins," the important business of a bank is to absorb deposits and develop loans, only recognizing foreign money and not recognizing people, it is certainly necessary to see the inflow and outflow of foreign money clearly.</p>
<p>The banknotes issued by the China Commercial Bank included both silver dollar notes and silver tael notes. The silver tael notes were issued exclusively by the China Commercial Bank, so even though the Ministry requested to mint and issue one tael silver dollars, it had already issued silver tael notes. Since Xie entered the China Commercial Bank, the credibility of the banknotes began to be solid, and they circulated in the market in the same way as foreign bank notes.</p>
<p>The opening of the Russo-Chinese Bank was very imposing. At that time, HSBC Bank was implicitly the leader of the financial world in Shanghai, and the Russo-Chinese Bank thought of surpassing it. Not only did it compete with it in business, but it also sought to surpass it in architecture, so it specially built a stone building to show off. Shanghai's first "stone house" started with the Russo-Chinese Bank, which is now the address of the Central Bank. Not only that, but it also opened up a wide square next to it for staff members to play ball in their spare time. Half of it still exists today, which shows the richness and thoughtfulness of its facilities. At this time, HSBC Bank did not yet have the towering mansion that stands tall on the Bund today.</p>
<p>It was rumored in Shanghai that when the Russo-Chinese Bank was first established, the Empress Dowager Cixi had invested five million taels in it, but the matter was confidential and could not be known in detail. However, after the defeat of the Sino-Japanese War, China repeatedly encountered foreign humiliation and suffered repeated defeats. The Russians took advantage of the opportunity to outwardly show goodwill to the Qing government, helping it to recover the Liaodong leased territory, but secretly preparing for future leases, and becoming the fuse for the Russo-Japanese War. The Qing court also thought of relying on Russian foreign aid to resist Japan, only thinking of venting anger, and not considering the future consequences. Moreover, in view of Japan's occupation of Liaodong, with others sleeping soundly beside the bed, the Qing court feared that unexpected disasters would arise and that things would happen in a hurry. The Russo-Chinese Bank happened to be established at this time, implicitly entrusting it to the Russians. In fact, it is impossible to clearly distinguish whether it existed or not, but in terms of reason, it is not without cause. What's more, there were officials and nobles who, in order to comply with the Qing court's orders, secretly deposited huge sums of private wealth in foreign banks, in order to avoid the trouble of investigation and confiscation, which almost became a trend. For example, in the first month of the 24th year of Guangxu, Huang Siyong said that because various countries were competing to borrow funds, it would be better to raise domestic debt, and also mentioned that Chinese people would rather deposit funds with foreign merchants and gamble on their securities, saying:</p>
<p>"In the treaty ports, Chinese people rely on foreigners to buy tickets (referring to bonds and stocks) and borrow money. They cannot use it themselves, so they invest in others. Today, there are countless private funds of gentry deposited in foreign banks under the name of foreign merchants for operation."</p>
<p>The words "gentry" here still did not dare to openly criticize as princes, dukes and high-ranking officials! Therefore, it is said again:</p>
<p>"The common people are not to be blamed. Please strictly order Chinese and foreign officials to inspire them with loyalty and righteousness, and first send officials to be advocates for the people."</p>
<p>This clearly states that officials deposited private wealth in foreign merchant banks. There is also one of the most obvious examples. At the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War, Prince Qing Yikuang transferred his private funds from the banks of the two warring countries to HSBC Bank. Jiang Shili memorialized and impeached him, saying:</p>
<p>"Firstly, on the 12th day of the 11th month of the 19th year of Guangxu (1903 in the Western calendar), Prince Yikuang, upon hearing the news of the Russo-Japanese War, withdrew 1.2 million of his private assets from the Russo-Chinese Bank and the Yokohama Specie Bank and deposited them in HSBC Bank in Dongjiaomin Lane. The bank knew his intention and made things difficult in every possible way before agreeing to accept the deposit, paying only a 1% monthly interest." (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Weak Sales in Cotton Yarn Port • Revolving Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market has stabilized, but the trend is still softening, because the actual position has not seen a large amount of progress. However, the Hong Kong merchants have a slightly better appetite for 20-count yarn, buying 250 bales of Two Golden Chickens and Da Fa, and 50 bales of Shepherd, and 120 bales of 10-count yarn, totaling 420 bales. Therefore, the bulls are active again, but some say that the inventory is still thick. In addition, a certain standard yarn is very low, and the ratio to Double Horse is too far apart, creating heavy pressure. There is also a saying that foreign customers have already turned from short to long in small amounts. Therefore, it revolves strongly between 420 and 430 yuan. The high price of 20-count Double Horse is 1,432 yuan, and the low price is 1,421 yuan. The range of rise and fall is narrow. After noon, most people are resting because it is the weekend. It is said that 200 to 300 bales were traded, and the price was 1,422 to 1,423 yuan. Today, 1,255 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning. Because the market sentiment in the afternoon of the previous day had turned high, the situation continued to tighten. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,430 yuan. As soon as this price opened, one side on the table raised the price and sold it. After a while, it rose slightly to 1,432 yuan. After that, the buying momentum slowed down, and the market suddenly loosened to 1,425 to 1,426 yuan. However, hat-snatching friends suddenly came to cover short positions, and it returned to 1,428 yuan. Then, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate had stabilized and the premium had not changed much. The market looked downward and fell to 1,421 yuan. Forced to the close, it returned to 1,425 yuan. It is found that the total transaction volume for half a day was 9,420 bales. The amount bought by each trade is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 420 Others 9,000 Total 9,420</p>
<p>Everyone is bullish on fine velvet</p>
<p>The current cotton situation is stable, and the industry is relatively active, mostly doing calculations, because foreign cotton is rising. However, manufacturers, in view of the pessimistic yarn sales and the difficulty of pushing out inventories, do not handle high-priced raw materials. However, 42-count raw materials are stimulated by foreign cotton and are becoming tighter, and there is also a sales route to a certain country overseas.</p>
<p>American Pengjiapo No. 309, 100 pieces, handed over to the warehouse</p>
<p>Another message says that the foreign cotton transaction of foreign firms in Shanghai is flat, and there are few transactions. However, because the foundation of raw cotton is solid, and at the same time, the purchase and transportation from overseas feel difficult, everyone is still unanimously bullish.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market first fell due to speculators selling, but then rose again due to public buying and Washington political news that the president would agree to the 85% loan case. As a result, the closing price rose by 18 to 19 points compared to the 10th.</p>
<p>Another telegram says that the American cotton statistics from August 1st of last year to May 23rd of this year are recorded below (500 pounds per bale):</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market has been temporarily suspended due to riots. As for the forecast for today's opening market, it is expected to be up by half a rupee due to the firm American cotton.</p>
<p>Securities • Domestic Debt Slightly Firm</p>
<p>The gray market of public bonds was slightly firmer yesterday, because there were slight official transactions, and people's minds were stabilized. Although sellers poured in, buyers bought it themselves and were not shaken by it, knowing that most of the sellers were floating households who were sensitive, and were not important to the market. Therefore, the accounts of both buyers and sellers in the market are worth paying attention to. Yesterday was Saturday, and only one session was done in the morning. Yu Yu No. 7 bought a lot of both Ding and Bing, and it was noticed for a while. Xie Kang was alert and followed the trend. Hongda Yitai sold it. Because the buyers were relatively strong, the result was slightly better by one or two dimes. Transactions amounted to 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock transaction, 100 shares of the Bank of China were traded, and the price was 92 yuan and 75 cents.</p>
<p>London, 23rd (Zhou Jiang) telegram, today's listed market for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks are both flat, and the market has not changed.</p>
<p>Piece Goods • Rayon Napped Fabrics • Resumed Dumping</p>
<p>Rayon napped fabrics once came to Shanghai five or six years ago, but because they were not durable, and extremely lacking in cold resistance, easy to break when wet, easy to wrinkle and tear when rubbed, everyone said they were fooled. The reputation of stores that sold them was damaged day by day, and no one asked about them one after another. Therefore, the time of sale was very short. Unexpectedly, in the current rising price of napped fabrics, this kind of inferior rayon napped fabrics has been shipped to Shanghai for dumping. Because the military department is making them, and most of them have not paid customs duties, the selling price is cheap. Many in the industry are greedy for the price, and there are many who are deceived. The cheapest one is two or three yuan, and the highest sells for 30 yuan. The ordinary price starts from 20 yuan to 25 or 26 yuan. Most ordinary shops hang a sign of five or six yuan to even seven or eight yuan per foot. Those who are sharp-eyed and experienced will be able to distinguish it with a little attention. By the way, rayon napped fabrics are mostly dyed with a shiny finish. Burn it with a match, and the real and fake will be distinguished immediately.</p>
<p>Sugar Market • Coarse White Continues to Loosen</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to weaken, because powerful figures in the industry were still selling, and people inevitably felt a downturn. The trade association's market was only open for trading in the morning because it was Saturday. The coarse white for the end of May was initially from 105 yuan, 12 cents to 5 cents, unchanged, and then fell to 4 yuan, 5 cents, 2 cents, 9 dimes, 6 cents. The 10th of June was initially 105 yuan, 5 cents, 9 cents, and then 5 cents, 1 cent, 8 dimes and a half. Taikoo Car White B Mark West Shallow 107 yuan, 6 cents, 6 dimes. The lower grade is firm, DY Mark West Warehouse Provincial Package 99 yuan, 7 cents, and sack packing 99 yuan.</p>
<p>Seafood • Laver Seaweed Prices are High</p>
<p>Now is the summer season for laver seaweed, and its digestion is quite active, so the price is gradually tightening. Recently, such as small square East laver seaweed, it opened at 635 yuan, to 640 yuan, and 671 yuan. New goods have not arrived. According to news from the producing area, the declared cost must be 700 yuan, which shows that the market will have to rise again.</p>
<p>Import and Export • Goods are Exchanged Between Hong Kong</p>
<p>Yesterday, 2,250 bags of white sugar and 6 pieces of bird's nest were shipped from Hong Kong. Today (the 25th), the exported goods include 23 pieces of tea and 1,140 pieces of piece goods, all shipped to Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>French Municipal Council Prepares to Sell Rice • Organizes Import Committee • Designates Three Foreign Firms to Jointly Handle • Requests from Areas Outside the Settlement to Receive Hong Kong Rice Not Approved</h3>
<p>The Saigon rice ordered directly from the Vietnamese government by the French Municipal Council, the first batch of 50,000 bags, will arrive in Shanghai this month. At the same time, the French Municipal Council has designated three companies, Dahu Foreign Firm at No. 181 Jiangxi Road, Fojia Foreign Firm at No. 34 Aiduya Road, and Shenji Foreign Firm at No. 2 Beijing Road, to jointly organize an import committee to handle the distribution and sale of this Saigon rice. Dahu and other three foreign firms are currently planning, but the method is said to be very different from the Shanghai Municipal Council's promotion of affordable Hong Kong rice. The specific plan will be announced after the Saigon rice arrives in Shanghai. At the same time, Saigon will also organize an export committee to handle export procedures.</p>
<p>Summoning Firms • Discussing Sales</p>
<p>The person in charge of handling this Saigon rice for the French Municipal Council is Sarey, the Minister of the Political Department. Last week, he summoned more than ten grain firms in this city, such as Ruichangfa, to discuss undertaking the sale of Saigon rice. The Municipal Council agreed to give the sales firms an 8% handling fee. The grain firms felt that the profit was too small and have not yet reached an agreement. One said that the profit has been agreed to be 5%.</p>
<p>Three Batches of Hong Kong Rice • Will Arrive Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's third batch of 20,000 bags of foreign rice shipped to Shanghai, transported by Taikoo Company's Nanjing and Suzhou No. 2 ships, could have arrived yesterday. However, the company suddenly received telegrams from the two ships saying that due to weather conditions, they would have to be delayed until today to arrive in Shanghai. Also, the company's Hanyang ship will also carry 10,000 bags of foreign rice for the Municipal Council to arrive in Shanghai today. According to reporters' inquiries to the French Shipping Company yesterday, the company's Xiafei ship will arrive at this city from Saigon at 2:30 pm today, carrying 30,000 bags of Saigon rice, which were ordered by local grain firms. The ship will berth at the Shuntai Wharf in Pudong to unload the goods.</p>
<p>Hongkou and Western Shanghai • Allowed to Sell</p>
<p>The Times reported that the foreign rice purchased by the Shanghai Municipal Council from Hong Kong is a great benefit to the general public. It is learned that the Municipal Council authorities yesterday (the 23rd) also allowed rice shops in the Hongkou and Western Shanghai areas to sell the Municipal Council's Hong Kong rice. However, rice shops in the Nanshi area cannot enjoy this benefit, for fear that some unscrupulous rice merchants may transfer the Municipal Council's rice to other places to make a profit. According to the Jianghai Customs report, the foreign rice imported to Shanghai in April totaled 109,060 tons, worth 21,555,000 yuan. Although the import volume of foreign rice this month has not been announced, it is expected to be more than in April.</p>
<p>Nanshi and Other Places • Temporarily Not Issued</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council allowed rice merchants in the areas beyond the settlement roads to resell the Municipal Council's foreign rice, they have rushed to order from Lijiyang Bank and the 17 grain firms designated by the authorities. Yesterday, several companies had paid and picked up the goods at Xiangmao Foreign Firm. However, most rice shops purchased from grain firms for business convenience. According to reporters' inquiries, rice merchants in Nanshi, Zhabei and Datang and other places sent people to Xiangmao Foreign Firm at 2 pm the day before yesterday to request permission to purchase the Municipal Council's foreign rice for sale in the stores, but the authorities, for some reason, indicated that "it is not allowed for the time being."</p>
<p>Rice Shop Employees • Requesting Salary Increase</p>
<p>The employees and workers of rice shops throughout the city have also been affected by the high cost of rice and their lives are difficult, with income not meeting expenses. Therefore, they jointly submitted a request for a salary increase to the shop owners yesterday, and set a deadline of three days for a satisfactory response. Excerpts from the salary increase conditions are as follows: the salary increase will be 70% of the new amount of 4 yuan, 8 yuan, 12 yuan, 16 yuan, and 20 yuan according to the employee level in 1937. The rice allowance is based on 50 yuan (No. 2 Saigon). For those exceeding 50 yuan, an additional 5 yuan will be given for every 10 yuan, rounded to the nearest whole number. The settlement will be based on the rice price increase or decrease at the end of the month. Workers will receive a flat increase of 10 yuan to their current salary. Regardless of the distance, the handling fee will be 25 cents per picul, totaling 20 items.</p>
<p>Those Driving by Horn are Bad Drivers</p>
<p>Yesterday was the sixth day of the anti-noise campaign, and there has been a reduction in those who indiscriminately honk their horns on the road. However, there are still many drivers who, even after having their horns modified at the car shop to reduce the noise, still honk them two or three times. It is hoped that this will be corrected immediately. In short, a good driver can drive without worry even if the car is temporarily not equipped with a horn. Those who want to show off and drive fast must honk continuously. However, in the event of an accident, whether the car owner or the hired driver, both will inevitably be subject to imprisonment. Therefore, the police's launch of the anti-noise campaign contains deep meaning. It is hoped that the public will not drive fast, so as not to cause trouble.</p>
<p>Western Newspaper Reporter Assaulted • Sues in Italian Court</p>
<p>Leonoff, the local editor of the Continental News, was verbally insulted and assaulted by an Italian in Western Shanghai the night before last (the 23rd). It is heard that he has filed a criminal lawsuit in the Italian Consulate Court yesterday. It has been found out that one of the four Italians who committed the assault was Saston Tinni, a prominent figure among the Fascists here. Saston telephoned Leonoff that afternoon and asked to meet him at the Royal Hotel at 4 pm. When Li arrived as scheduled, he was assaulted by three Italians who were waiting there. One of them was named Peignuki, and another was named Lamoyuan, who lived on Albert Road and opened a clothing store. The other one was a sports teacher. According to reports, that evening, the Italians first asked Mr. Li to meet at the Royal Hotel, but later, on the pretext that the location of the hotel was inconvenient, they changed the location to the Huizhong Hotel. Later, they tricked Mr. Li into chatting at the Italian Association, and then, on an empty lot, four Italians forced Mr. Li to drink a bottle of castor oil. Mr. Li refused, and as a result, a conflict broke out. Mr. Li was severely injured due to being outnumbered.</p>
<h3>Hansun Transport Ship Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday • US Marine Corps Transferred • 270 US Troops in Shanghai Return Home • Over a Hundred Troops from North China Defense Force Travel Together • Approximately One Hundred Replacements Arrive in Shanghai on the Ship</h3>
<p>The US Navy transport ship Hansun, sailing from the United States, via Manila and various ports in North China, carrying the Marine Corps band stationed in the US Embassy in North China, continued south. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday morning. The 270 US Marine Corps soldiers in Shanghai whose service term had expired waited at the Customs Wharf from 6 am yesterday to board the Hansun to return to the United States. However, the ship was slightly delayed outside the Wusongkou and only entered the port at 12 noon. It is scheduled to depart today and then go to Manila to visit Old Yushan. When the Hansun arrived in Shanghai today, it carried 123 Marine Corps soldiers whose service term in the East had expired and who were being transferred back to the United States from North China. As for the number of US troops transferred from the United States, the official did not announce it, but it is generally believed that about 100 soldiers were carried by the ship to Shanghai as replacements. US Asian Fleet officers and soldiers whose service term in the East had expired also returned home on the ship. It is found that in the past, US Navy transport ships would stay here for about ten days, but at the beginning of this year, the transport ship Jiameng only stayed briefly before leaving.</p>
<h3>Italian Ship Detained in Dinghai • Goods All Lost • Detained for Over Five Months and Released a Few Days Ago</h3>
<p>The English Great American Evening News says that it has recently learned that the Italian merchant ship Amalia was detained by the Japanese Navy in Dinghai, Zhoushan Islands, for over five months. It has now been released and arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, but all the goods on board have been lost. The ship's Shanghai manager, Stanner Mattilettos, told reporters that the ship was registered in Italy and flew the Italian flag. The goods on board were entrusted by Chinese people to be delivered to American, British and Italian merchants and have been seized by the Japanese. He has therefore protested to the Italian Consulate and is waiting for the Italian Consulate authorities to take action. However, according to an Italian Consulate official's reply to reporters, Italian officials are unlikely to take any action in this matter.</p>
<p>Negotiating for the Return of American Merchants' Goods</p>
<p>It is also heard that the goods delivered to American merchants that were seized by the Japanese were mostly Wenzhou lace and embroidery. The US Consul General in Shanghai has therefore negotiated with the Japanese authorities, requesting an investigation so that the goods can be returned to their original owners. The US Consul is currently awaiting a reply from the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Detained for Half a Year • Recently Released</h3>
<p>It is found that the Amalia traveled between Wenzhou and Shanghai. At the beginning of December of last year, it was detained by a Japanese warship in Dinghai, a small port in the Zhoushan Islands. Chinese passengers on board the ship were allowed to disembark, but the ship was detained. It was only released a few days ago, and all the goods on board were lost. It is heard that when the Japanese confiscated the goods, they forced the captain to sign a statement stating that the goods were all owned by Chinese merchants. The captain had no choice but to sign it reluctantly under protest, and the ship was released.</p>
<h3>Medical Association Assists • Epidemic Prevention Campaign • Notifies All Shanghai Physicians to Mobilize • Voluntarily Vaccinate Citizens</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Medical Association held its 11th session, 24th executive committee meeting yesterday. Chairman Zhu Yanggao passed four reports and discussed two proposals. The first item was a proposal by Committee Member Song Guobin to launch an epidemic prevention campaign, which was approved. It was decided to assist the health authorities in holding an epidemic prevention campaign from June 1st for half a month. The method is to notify all member physicians to sacrifice one or two hours each day to vaccinate citizens for epidemic prevention, free of charge or for a small fee. Before vaccination, they should first examine those who are not suitable for vaccination and then issue a certificate of non-vaccination. Certificates will only be issued after the third vaccination, but they must adhere to the creed and never bend to personal feelings. They will also consult with Xinya, Xinyi, and Daxi three pharmaceutical factories to provide vaccines free of charge. After this is implemented, it will truly benefit society and also supplement what the health authorities cannot do.</p>
<h3>Yesterday was British Empire Day • British Expats Celebrated Enthusiastically • Telegraphing the British King to Pledge Allegiance and Believe in Victory</h3>
<p>Shanghai British expats celebrated Empire Day yesterday (the 24th) with patriotic fervor. At 8 am, the flag-raising ceremony was held at the Central Consulate as usual, and British Consul General George inspected the boy and girl scouts, and the national anthem was played. Many scouts' relatives and friends came to the consulate to watch the inspection. After the ceremony, the Great Britain Victory Association and the Royal Empire Society provided breakfast for the scouts. At noon, the British members of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce hosted a banquet for friends and members of other nationalities. The equestrian competition hosted by the British Expats Federation was held in the afternoon at the racecourse polo field, and the proceeds were donated to the British War Fund. The St. George Association, the St. Andrew Association, the St. Patrick Association, the St. David Association, the Canadian General Chamber of Commerce and the Australian New Zealand Association of this city, on this Empire Day, jointly telegraphed the British King at Buckingham Palace in London, saying, "The Shanghai British and Commonwealth national associations respectfully assure His Majesty of their unwavering loyalty and belief in victory." British Consul General George, and the Commercial Commissioners of Canada, Australia, and South Africa in China, all issued Empire Day messages to encourage expats.</p>

<h3>French Pharmaceutical Exhibition Opened Yesterday at Aurora University; French Consul General Praises Profound Chinese Medicine</h3>
<p>The French Pharmaceutical Exhibition opened yesterday (24th) at 3:00 PM at Aurora University, officiated by the French Consul General. Over a thousand people from Chinese and foreign circles attended. Order at the venue was maintained by French Boy Scouts. The French Consul General first delivered an opening address, reporting on the process of the University of Paris preparing for the exhibition, and that the exhibits included extremely valuable instruments, engravings, films, etc., and introduced famous French figures who promoted medicine. Afterwards, Dr. Loyt, the French representative in charge of preparations, gave a speech on the preparatory process. It was also announced that the exhibition would be open all day from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM starting tomorrow, welcoming visitors from all walks of life without the need for tickets. Tomorrow evening (26th) at 6:00 PM, Dr. Loyt will give a lecture entitled "The French Academy and Medicine" (in French), followed by a French sound film. In his opening address, the French Consul General praised Chinese medicine and the students of Aurora University.</p>
<p>French Consul General Praises Chinese Medicine</p>
<p>The French Consul General stated briefly that, a few months ago, when he visited Aurora University, he was very impressed to see Chinese students very proficient in surgery, physiology, and anatomy. In his personal opinion, Chinese students are rich in the innate talent for diagnosis, and they can inherit and promote China's inherent medicine. In this era of modern medicine, Chinese medicine cannot be ignored. China is a country with the most extensive medical knowledge. Chinese scholars have studied the importance of the pulse and have made detailed deductions, especially making the greatest contribution to the diagnosis and treatment of typhoid fever. Today, the world is accustomed to the method of vaccination, but the Chinese have invented a specialty for the diagnosis and treatment of smallpox centuries ago. He sincerely wished that this exhibition would arouse the attention of Chinese doctors and medical students, and that one day they would also report on the success of their work, so that China and France could communicate and mutually improve their medical knowledge.</p>

<h3>Outgoing Colonel Baker Leaves Shanghai to Return to Washington; Returns to the Country This Morning on the President Taft</h3>
<p>Outgoing Colonel Baker, commander of the Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai, has been ordered to work in the Navy Department in Washington.

<h3>Freight Rates on the Pacific Coast Doubled</h3>
<p>The New York Freight Bureau and the North China Pacific Freight Bureau announced that the freight rates for ports along the Pacific coast, calculated per forty cubic feet, for those with contracts, were US$10.50, and have now increased to US$24. For those without contracts, the original price was US$24, and has now increased to US$29.

<p>Workers Laid Off by the Commercial Press Go on Hunger Strike in the Factory</p>
<p>A total of 27 labor disputes occurred in the Public Concession last month, with a total of 10,577 workers on strike, resulting in a loss of 81,045 workdays. There was also one incident in the area beyond the boundaries of the road construction area, with 100 workers on strike. In addition, there were eight slowdown strikes, affecting 1,853 workers. The loss of workdays in the two concessions totaled more than 174,954 days. During this extraordinary period, the public sincerely hopes that both labor and management can be honest with each other and overcome the difficulties together.</p>
<p>Commercial Press Workers on Hunger Strike Evicted</p>
<p>The representatives of the Commercial Press Workers' Union have exhausted all their efforts to seek mediation from the authorities and assistance from all sectors, but to no avail. The hundreds of laid-off employees were extremely panicked. Yesterday (24th) at around 10:00 AM, led by the representatives, more than two hundred laid-off male and female employees went to the Gorden Road factory, and managed to open the doors of the printing department. The employees then began a hunger strike, without damaging any machinery or objects, and the order was very good. According to the person in charge, the hunger strike in the factory was due to the fact that there was no other way to think of. Rather than being laid off and starving to death on the streets, it would be better to starve to death directly in the company. At around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, representatives from the Circulation Department came to offer condolences, and left after talking for about an hour. At around 6:00 PM, police cars drove up, full of armed detectives, who forcibly evicted the laid-off employees from the factory and arrested representatives Gu, Tian, Pan, and Chen. The representatives immediately convened an emergency meeting to deal with everything.</p>
<p>North-South Goods Industry Resumes Business Yesterday</p>
<p>More than 3,000 employees of more than 250 North-South goods stores in the city went on strike on the morning of the 23rd. The capitalists immediately convened the labor side to mediate. After repeated concessions from both sides, the labor side agreed to resume work first. As for the rice subsidy and other conditions, they were resolved during the negotiations between the two parties yesterday. All employees are working as usual.</p>
<p>Paint Workers Strike, Arrested and Dispersed</p>
<p>The paint workers employed by Ni Shenji Construction Factory at No. 951, Lane 4, Chengdu Road, suddenly went on strike on the morning of the 23rd. More than a hundred workers gathered in front of the factory, and the order was chaotic, and the situation was quite serious. After the police received the news, they sent a large number of detectives to the scene to disperse them. It was found that the original wages of the factory workers were 3 yuan and 25 cents per person per day. The two parties had previously signed conditions that if the price of rice reached 150 yuan, the wages would be increased by one yuan. Last month, the price of rice was manipulated and raised by rice merchants, and once rose to more than 150 yuan. The labor side believed that it had the right to demand an increase in wages, while the capitalist side believed that the price of rice had soon fallen, and the demand should be cancelled.</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Police Officer Kikuchi Kabashima Attacked in Nanshi; Bullet Penetrates the Chest and Dies Immediately; Japanese Army Conducts a Major Search in Nanshi and Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, inside the old North Gate of Nanshi, a Japanese military police officer was suddenly shot and killed. After the case occurred, the Japanese military authorities conducted a major search in the Nanshi area. At the same time, the iron gates of the French Concession bordering Nanshi were all closed. It is reported that at around 10:30 AM yesterday, a Japanese military police officer in a yellow uniform was passing through the intersection of Fuyou Road and Jiucang Street when a man suddenly jumped out from the side of the road and fired two shots at his back. The military police officer was caught off guard and was hit, with the bullet penetrating his chest. He fell to the center of the street near the Daji Hotel, and died of his injuries after a while. Afterwards, the Japanese side received the news and quickly sent a large team to guard the area, and cut off traffic there. However, the shooter had disappeared. The Japanese side then conducted a large-scale search in the area. It is reported that during the search, the Japanese army captured two men walking by in a certain place, because they found a pistol on their bodies. As for the iron gates of the French Concession, since they were closed and pedestrians were prohibited from entering and exiting, they were not opened last night. Therefore, some citizens who entered Nanshi yesterday morning were blocked in the city.</p>
<h3>Western Shanghai Area Completely Blocked</h3>
<p>The English-language "Da Mei Evening News" reported that at 10:30 AM this morning (24th), Japanese military police officer Kikuchi Kabashima was shot five or six times by an assailant in front of house number 60, Jiucang Street, Nanshi, while wearing plain clothes. Two bullets penetrated the temples. He was rushed to the Japanese military hospital in Nanshi, but was pronounced dead. The assailant escaped. After the case occurred, the Japanese military police force closed all the iron gates of the French Concession bordering Nanshi, and searched house by house in the area where the incident occurred. It is heard that three suspects have been arrested, their names unknown. Afterwards, martial law was suddenly declared in the Western Shanghai area, such as the intersection of Xujiahui and Hongqiao Road, the intersection of Bailinan Road and the railway, Dada West Road, and Kaixuan Road, with the area being closed off all day and traffic cut off.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Bank Employee Zhuang and His Son Kidnapped; Zhuang Mengwen and His Son Encounter Danger in Front of Their Residence; Suddenly Abducted by Three Bandits While Stepping into the Car</h3>
<p>A kidnapping case occurred on Zhao Bishop Road in the French Concession yesterday morning. The kidnapped victims were Zhuang Mengwen, an employee of the Shanghai Bank, and his son. The details of the case are as follows:</p>
<p>Escorting Son to the Bank in the Morning</p>
<p>Zhuang Mengwen, a native of Changzhou, is an employee of the Trust Department of the Shanghai Commercial Savings Bank. He is 40 years old and married to Wu (39 years old). He has a son named Zhaoqing, who is 16 years old and is studying at the High School affiliated with St. John's University. At 8:30 AM yesterday morning, Zhuang wanted to go to the bank to work, and his son Zhaoqing wanted to go to a new barber shop on Nanjing Road. So he accompanied his father, instructing the car to take a detour.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Three Bandits Kidnapped Them</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, as the father and son stepped out of the gate one after another, just as they were about to get into their private car No. 7377, three bandits in gray suits, each holding a box cannon, intimidated Zhuang and his son and the local driver Feng Ada (32 years old), forbidding them from making a sound, and ordered Zhuang and his son to enter the car. At the same time, another bandit drove Feng out of the car, and the bandit drove away, kidnapping them without a trace. Afterwards, Feng returned home to report to the mistress Wu, who reported to the French police to investigate their whereabouts, and strictly searched for Zhuang's private car No. 7377.</p>
<h3>Ticket Scalping at Grand Theatre; Two Defendants Released on Bail for Further Verification</h3>
<p>In the Grand Theatre on Jing'an Temple Road, there was a strike of ticket collectors and ticket sellers last month. It is now known that the strike was actually caused by the ticket sellers and ticket collectors colluding to commit fraud, which was discovered by the authorities. On April 15 this year, a ticket collector, Wang Runsheng from Jiading, collected the tickets when collecting tickets, but did not tear them, hoping to give them to the ticket office to resell. He was discovered by the manager, a Westerner named Irif, who questioned him strictly. Only then did he learn that there were more than a dozen people colluding to commit fraud, from December last year to the present, which has lasted for several months. He ordered all ticket collectors and ticket sellers to be suspended, which caused the strike. Zhang Kunfeng, a Chinese detective from the Xinzha Police Station, and detective Xu Shutian arrested the ticket collector Wang Runsheng and the ticket seller Chen Jingbo. This morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the case, requesting a postponement, and also based on the complaint from the Westerner manager of the Grand Theatre. When the two defendants were questioned, they admitted to the fraud, and hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to request bail. The court ordered the two defendants to each pay 500 yuan bail to be released, and rescheduled for seven days for further verification.</p>

<h3>Self-Reflection</h3>
<p>— Xiao Ning</p>
<p>"Self-reflection," "introspection," children, perhaps you are tired of hearing this term? But how many of you have truly done it? I think there must be very few!</p>
<p>"Why do we need to self-reflect?" Many children must be confused. The answer to this question can be divided into the following points:</p>
<p>1. Do you admit that the only person in the world who can truly know you (that is, "know everything you do and think") is yourself! Of course, everything about you should be deeply pondered and borne by you. As for the guidance of others, it is only of a helping nature!</p>
<p>2. Self-reflection can develop your reason. In other words, through constant reflection, your reasoning power will become stronger, because your ability to distinguish between right and wrong is improved in an intangible way!</p>
<p>3. Self-reflection can cultivate your good habit of being cautious and meticulous!</p>
<p>4. Self-reflection can cultivate your character and promote your progress!</p>
<p>No one in the world dares to say that they have no shortcomings. Precisely because of this, "self-reflection" is his best remedy. Therefore, children, when a day has passed, you should reflect calmly: Have you done anything bad today? Have you said anything bad? Have you wasted time? Have you owed anything in your homework...? If you find mistakes, then eliminate them immediately! Correct them! In this way, your progress must be accelerated!</p>
<p>Look! In history! How many great figures are there who do not have a great spirit of self-reflection? Yes, children, if you want to be a great man, you should also carry forward the spirit of self-reflection and strive to examine yourselves!</p>
<h3>Why Aren't Aimei's Grades Good?</h3>
<p>— Wan</p>
<p>Kexiong and Aimei are siblings who are both studying at Qinzhi Elementary School. Kexiong is one year older than Aimei, so he is in a higher grade. On weekdays after school, Kexiong always jumps and plays around and refuses to review his homework until 7:00. But Aimei is not like that. She takes a book home and reads it from time to time. However, she is not very focused. When her mother is talking to a neighbor, she wants to listen to what they are saying. When she hears that someone's child is crying, she wants to go out and see what happened. She is always walking around with the book. So when there is a lot of homework on that day, she cries anxiously at night.</p>
<p>The days pass quickly. The second quiz is approaching. The teachers at Qinzhi Elementary School have also begun to prepare for the exam. Therefore, the lazy students have to open up the unfamiliar books to prepare for this important moment. At this time, Aimei's study time is particularly long, while Kexiong is still playing freely besides reviewing his homework an hour earlier. To others, Aimei seems to be more diligent than Kexiong.</p>
<p>When the two report cards arrived in his father's hands, he couldn't help but feel strange. Why did Aimei barely pass arithmetic, while Kexiong's grades were excellent? After much thought, he knew that Aimei's study method must be inappropriate. So he called her in front of him and asked, "How did you prepare for the exam?" She replied, "Father, I prepared very well before the exam. I read it several times from beginning to end until I could memorize it, but I don't know why I forgot everything when I took the exam? Like this time when I took arithmetic, many of the questions were not in the book. I can do all the projects I have done in the book." Father asked, "Do you understand everything?" She said, "There are many things I don't understand, but I remember them very well!" Father instructed her, "Your method of rote memorization is not right! No wonder you have no time to play. You must know that if you want to have good grades in the future, you have to change your attitude towards studying. First, you must concentrate when studying, and you must not have any distracting thoughts in your mind, nor can you look around. Only by focusing on the big book can you gain insights. Second, you must thoroughly understand; no matter what subject, if you have any doubts, stop until you ask and understand. At that time, you have gained real knowledge, and it is not easy to forget. Third, you must distinguish the key points in the book and underline them with a pen, so that you don't have to memorize the words in the book, so as not to waste time. Fourth, organize the important points you have underlined, such as an event in history, analyze the cause, process, and result clearly, so that it is more convenient and easier to remember. Then, after we know the contents of the book, we close the book and recall it in our minds. Review the parts that are unclear or unfamiliar. If you prepare in this way, you will not only gain real knowledge, but also be able to solve difficult problems even if you encounter them in the exam. Your brother has learned the secret of studying, so even though his study time is short, he has achieved results. You might as well try it!" Aimei happily received her father's guidance and knew her shortcomings, so she kept them firmly in her mind.</p>
<h3>About Diaries</h3>
<p>— Shadow Dumb</p>
<p>A diary is a personal history. If you record the things you encounter each day, it indeed holds historical value if you occasionally browse through it later? Moreover, writing a diary every day greatly helps writing skills, far more beneficial than attending two hours of composition class each week. Understanding the value of diaries, then we can further discuss various issues related to diaries.</p>
<p>Before starting a diary, there is a prerequisite: persistence. This can be considered extremely difficult. We have seen many people write diaries, initially very excited, writing every day. Later, they become casual, writing when they feel like it, and not writing when they don't. Eventually, they abandon it altogether, like a snake with a tiger's head but a feeble tail, starting but not finishing. Therefore, if we don't write a diary, so be it; if we write one, we must be determined to write every day, without fail, and see it through to the end.</p>
<p>Finding topics for a diary is a problem. We know that the diaries we are talking about now are not like the old, rigid ones that only recorded "cloudy," "sunny," "wind," "rain," when one got up, when one ate, and who came to visit. I once told my classmates: we see and encounter many things in a day, but we don't need to record them all. What we record should be things worth recording, things that are either peculiar and rare or evoke emotions of joy or sorrow. Only then is it worth recording. It's like writing a novel, eliminating unnecessary material first. What remains should have a special purpose and be worth recording. Otherwise, what is the value of the diary?</p>
<p>Schools require students to write two diary entries per week. In fact, there are many things one can write about in two diary entries a week. However, most students find writing diaries a headache, mainly because they find it difficult to find topics. When grading, what is seen is all about selling rice, beggars begging, or police officers beating people, or students reading books or watching movies and just copying a section of the book or film synopsis to get by. Such diaries are really too ordinary, aren't they?</p>
<p>However, it must be said that students do have good topics in their diaries, just not many. I remember last year, a student wrote about how one day, after school, when he was reviewing his homework, his father came home and invited friends to play mahjong, immediately asking him to give up the table. He was writing and gave up the table a little late, which angered his father, who scolded him. He argued with his father, questioning whether playing mahjong was more important or studying. At the same time, he felt dissatisfied with family education.</p>
<p>Recently, a female student wrote about how the families in her building have been arguing about hiring a nanny these past few days. They went to the employment agency to hire a nanny, but the nannies either left after one meal or one night. Too many people to serve, too low wages, and lack of sanitation were all reasons why they didn't want to work, not even willing to empty the chamber pot or take care of children. Hiring a nanny is so difficult, yet every employment agency is full of women waiting to be hired. Rice costs more than one hundred yuan per [unit]. Therefore, she suspects that the distorted and contradictory nature of Shanghai society is beyond imagination.</p>
<p>Like the two examples above, although they cannot be considered amazing topics, they are generally more valuable diary material to record compared to what others write, more interesting, and have research value. Therefore, I specifically introduce them to the young readers of this publication. If we want to write a diary, then we must pay attention all day long and seize the topics for our diary, and not let them slip by due to negligence, otherwise, it is too regrettable.</p>
<h3>Cold</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhen</p>
<p>The weather is erratic, suddenly cold and suddenly hot, especially noticeable these past few days. When the sun hasn't even peeked out in the morning, the air is already very stuffy. Once the sun shines, the mercury in the thermometer immediately climbs up, quickly reaching around ninety degrees, making Ah Hui feel hot even wearing a single-layer shirt. Suddenly, patches of white clouds gather rapidly, completely obscuring the sun. A whooshing sound suddenly emanates from the treetops, followed by the sound of torrential rain on the roof, coupled with flashes of lightning and booming thunder. All the conditions for a thunderstorm—thunder, lightning, wind, and rain—are finally met. In less than an hour, the wind stopped, the rain ceased, the lightning stopped flashing, the thunder stopped rumbling, and the clouds dispersed. However, the mercury in the thermometer suddenly plummeted. The difference in climate within just one hour is like two seasons—high summer and late winter. Ah Hui certainly felt a chill, but he didn't want to add another layer of clothing, which led to him catching a cold. A day later, the symptoms of a cold appeared one by one—sneezing, hoarse throat, stuffy nose, and fever. Ah Hui had to lie in bed and couldn't go to school.</p>
<p>His father often came to his bedside to check on him. Once, he even asked his father the question, "How do you catch a cold?"</p>
<p>"A cold is one of the most common diseases. It is caused by being exposed to the cold, but it is also due to bacteria. It is mostly transmitted from others, and the easiest way to transmit it is when cold bacteria spread with the wind. Once they reach our nostrils and throat, if our body is not strong, or if we are overly fatigued, have indigestion, or are chilled, these bacteria take advantage of this opportunity and quickly invade our nostrils and throat and multiply, causing inflammation and swelling, which makes us feel a stuffy nose and have a lot of mucus, and a hoarse throat. These are all the results of inflammation and swelling. When a cold occurs, you should cough and stay in bed, which are the best treatments. You should know that a cold can be transmitted to others. So, staying in bed not only cures the cold but also prevents it from being transmitted to others. There is a saying in our country that after catching a cold, one writes many red papers with the words 'Selling severe cold, success upon seeing it' and posts them on the telephone poles on the road. When others see it, the cold can be transmitted to that person, and the person can be cured. Does such a miraculous cure really exist in the world? This is completely a mindless act and shows the selfishness of our people. However, a cold is indeed contagious, but we should not intentionally transmit it to others. We should prevent the transmission of colds by living alone in a room, opening the windows to ensure ventilation, eating nutritious food, and getting enough sleep. After a week of recuperation, you can recover."</p>
<h3>Animals Also Participate in Human Wars</h3>
<p>— De Gang</p>
<p>Children, we know from studying history that many animals can help humans in warfare. For example, in ancient China, knives were used on the horns of cattle to charge and kill enemies. In foreign countries during the Middle Ages, soldiers often took snakes or geckos and other frightening reptiles to throw into enemy camps or warships. Some also used cats or rats, carrying filth, to drive into enemy camps. Later, someone invented attaching burning wooden strips or straw to the tails of birds and letting them fly onto the roofs of enemy houses to set them on fire. There are countless ways to use animals in warfare. In modern warfare, many animals can also help humans in warfare. The most well-known are, of course, military dogs and carrier pigeons, which perform reconnaissance and deliver messages for humans. In addition to dogs and pigeons, there are dozens of other animals that can also help humans in warfare. Let me introduce them to you one by one.</p>
<p>The first animal I want to introduce is the pig. During World War I, the Allied forces used them in warfare. Because the German positions at that time, just like this time, were covered with minefields, it would be a very difficult and dangerous undertaking for the British and French forces to rashly attack the Germans. So someone came up with a clever way to destroy the German minefields. They drove many pigs into the German mine areas. These poor animals were completely unaware of the danger to their lives and were just running, jumping, and trampling wildly, most of them triggering the terrible mines, ending their lives and opening up the first step of difficult work for the Allied forces. During that war, in addition to pigs, the British and French forces also mobilized a lot of cattle to undertake this mine-sweeping work.</p>
<p>The second animal to be introduced is the horse. The horse has the noblest task in wartime, which is to carry cavalry, gallop on the battlefield, and perform search and reconnaissance work. In addition, the horse has a secondary duty: the serum in the horse's blood can treat many infectious diseases of soldiers. Recently, the German government has requisitioned a large number of farmers' draft horses for military use and released many elephants and camels from zoos to replace horses for farming and driving.</p>
<p>Cats also have a role in war because their sensitive sense of smell can easily detect certain kinds of poisonous gases, so cats can help prevent enemy gas attacks. In France, there is a tomb commemorating a cat because the cat accompanied its owner in the trenches all day long during World War I, and whenever the German army used poisonous gas, the cat would scratch its owner's clothes, as if telling him to quickly put on a gas mask and take precautions in advance, thus saving its owner's life many times.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to introduce the spider. How can spiders help in warfare? It turns out that spider silk is very useful for various optical instruments, such as rangefinders and telescopes used by artillery. Because spider silk is extremely fine and sticks to the lens, it can be used as a very accurate aiming mark. Recently, many opticians in Britain have been ordered by the government to catch large numbers of spiders in order to extract fine silk to reinforce various optical instruments used in warfare.</p>

<h3>Three Famous Pairs of Storytellers</h3>
<p>— Maple</p>
<p>Jiang Zhu, Shen Xue, Zhu Zhao</p>
<p>Jiang Zhu, Shen Xue, Zhu Zhao are known as the three famous pairs of storytellers: Jiang Ruting, Zhu Jiesheng; Shen Jian'an, Xue Xiaoqing; Zhu Yaoxiang, Zhao Jiaqiu for short. Over the past decade or so, they have become famous all over Jiangnan, standing on equal footing, with no distinction in quality. Some have asked to compare their storytelling skills, I cannot answer, so I will try to describe their differences. In terms of storytelling ability: Jiang Zhu is good at "Falling Golden Fan," "Double Gold Ingots"; Shen Xue is good at "Pearl Tower"; Zhu Zhao is good at "Tears and Laughter Marriage"; these are also their famous stories. In addition, Jiang Zhu can also perform "Three Smiles," "Double Pearl Phoenix"; Shen Xue can also perform "Yang Guifei," "Tears and Laughter Marriage," (the script is different from Zhu Zhao's). Zhu Zhao can also perform "Gorgeous Romance," "Four Fragrant Romance," "Painted Golden Phoenix," "Red Robe," "Yu Tangchun," etc.; Zhu Zhao can perform the most stories.</p>
<p>In terms of Singing</p>
<p>(Tune): Jiang Zhu follows Yu; Shen Xue follows Ma, Yaoxiang follows Ma, Jiaqiu follows Yu, Jiang Zhu follows Yu and is very similar! Shen Xue follows Ma but is slightly different; Zhu Zhao follows Ma and Yu but is very different; some say it is a free tune. Jiesheng's singing is soft and glutinous; Xiaoqing's singing is clear and salty; he has the reputation of a golden voice; Jiaqiu's singing is lively. Ruting sings Yu's tune and is no weaker than Jiesheng. Jian'an's singing is better because of its richness and charm. However, since his voice failed, it has been difficult to please. Commentators say that his charm still exists, which is appropriate. Yaoxiang's singing is heavy and thick, which is also acceptable.</p>
<p>In terms of playing</p>
<p>The two pairs are closely coordinated. Jiang Zhu's playing is subtle and quiet; Shen Xue's playing is bright and loud. Especially when Jiesheng sings Yu's gentle tune, Ruting's sanxian accompanies the tune with high and low, fast and slow, and adds ups and downs to the music, which is even more superb.</p>
<p>In terms of Speaking</p>
<p>Jiang Zhu is known for being steady; Shen Xue is known for being unrestrained; Zhu Zhao is known for being detailed. Ruting is best at playing the roles in the stories, such as Lu Fu in "Falling Golden Fan," Qi Ziqing in "Double Gold Ingots," and Little Erguan. His portrayals of Lu Fu's foolishness and Little Er's naughtiness are vivid and lifelike, and listeners cannot help but laugh. Jian'an's descriptions of Fang's mother missing her son and the aunt's snobbery are exhaustive. Therefore, Shen Xue's "Mother-in-law and Daughter-in-law Meeting" and "Aunt and Niece Arguing in the Ziwu Hall" are still popular. Zhu Zhao is especially good at portraying the scene; the warlord is tyrannical, the weak woman is aggrieved, the knight is righteous, the talented man is affectionate, not only is it expressed in words, but also in form, with meticulous depiction, and is quite like painting. Yaoxiang is even better at various dialects, which is unmatched by others.</p>
<p>Jiang Zhu is like the Beijing Chao school in Peking Opera, because they follow the old methods without the slightest hesitation. Zhu Zhao is like the Shanghai school in Peking Opera, because they slightly improve the old methods and create vernacular openings. Shen Xue is in between the two, and their speaking also mixes new terms.</p>
<p>In terms of Physical State</p>
<p>Ruting likes football in his spare time and is currently the president of the Guangyu Club Football Club. Jiesheng is even better at Kunqu Opera, "Selling Horses" and "Chunxiang Makes Trouble in School" are his representative works. Jian'an's voice has failed, and people call him the Qipai storyteller. Junqing likes to sing Henan Opera in his spare time, following Xiang Wan Hua. Qipai storytelling paired with a Meipai amateur is truly an elegant thing. Zhu Zhao can also perform Kunqu Opera and Peking Opera; he can also perform stage plays. He once performed in the play "Peach Blossom Fan" at the Oriental Drama Troupe!</p>
<p>Ruting has dark skin, and Jiesheng is blind in one eye. Jian'an is [unclear], Xiao [unclear] is fat; Yaoxiang is tall, and Jiaqiu is short. These are the differences in the physical forms of the six people. And the fat ones are paired with the thin ones, and the tall ones are matched with the short ones, which is interesting! All of the above are just the highlights. Due to space limitations, the details will not be elaborated here. This spring, Jiang Zhu retired from the storytelling scene, and Shen Xue announced the separation of the pair. Only Zhu Zhao can still be heard in the storytelling scene, which makes people feel a sense of the vicissitudes of life!</p>
<h3>"Siege" Stage Scene</h3>
<h3>An Outline of the Philosophy of Strenuous Practice</h3>
<p>— Zong Yu</p>
<p>Those who engage in physical labor should also engage in mental labor, and those who engage in mental labor should also engage in physical labor. Physical and mental labor should not be separated. Everyone can produce, and everyone can seek improvements in production technology. The misconception that those who engage in mental labor govern others, and those who engage in physical labor are governed by others, must be completely eradicated.</p>

<p>Chapter 9: Why Did You Come to the End of the World, My Lord?</p>
<p>Liu Yin Ying's aunt called from outside, "The guest has come from afar. You should let him rest early. We can talk more tomorrow." Liu Yin Yang was reminded by his aunt's words and stood up and said, "Brother, please rest. We will talk more tomorrow. There is a small bedroom behind the library that can be used as a guest room. Please sleep there." Xu Jing said, "Thank you for your kindness." So Liu Yin Ying lit the candle and led Xu Jing to the inner room. It was indeed very small. Xu Jing's luggage was already placed on the kang, and everything had been arranged for him. There was a small door behind the room that led to the kitchen, but it was already locked. Xu Jing looked at it and said, "Very good. The room doesn't have to be big. As long as there is a kang, I can sleep well. Thank you, thank you." Liu Yin Ying placed the candlestick on a small table next to the kang and said, "There is no need to be polite between brothers. See you tomorrow." After saying this, he turned around and walked to the small room. Xu Jing met a new friend today and felt comforted by their compatible conversation. He also felt that Liu Yin Ying's dart skills were superb and his swordsmanship was also high, which could be called a unique skill. How could he compare to him? It was an honor to make such a friend. So, when he went to sleep on the kang, he didn't think about the shame of being expelled from the Wang family, and he felt like he was in a sweet dream. When he woke up, it was already dawn. After getting up, a small maid brought face water. Xu Jing washed his face, rinsed his mouth, combed his hair, and dressed neatly before walking outside. Liu Yin Ying was already sitting outside waiting, and they had breakfast together. That day, Xu Jing and Liu Yin Ying sat and talked in the morning, and in the afternoon, they took a walk on the ridge and returned. Liu Yin Ying's aunt was also hospitable and invited Xu Jing to eat and drink large bowls of wine and large pieces of meat. After staying for a few days, they felt very harmonious. Xu Jing felt a little uneasy. He wanted to go to the Wang family as soon as possible to act according to the planned plan, to make Wang Yongtai understand who was a good person and who was a bad person, and then he could come forward and introduce Liu Yin Ying to General Zhou Yuji to work together. So, on the afternoon of the fourth day, when Liu Yin Ying was not around, he sat alone in the study, looked up at the beams, and thought for a long time, and couldn't help but sigh, "I will do it this way. I must clear the injustice suffered by others, and also eliminate the source of trouble for him, regardless of whether he is annoyed or not. (72)</p>
