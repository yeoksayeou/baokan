<h3>兒童無罪</h3>
<p>今日兒童節，是現代的節日，是中國的，是超國界而爲國際的。</p>
<p>他日的國際必然是現代兒童的國際，他日的中國必然是現代中國兒童是的中國；總之，他日的一切，無論其爲責任，爲享受，哭或笑，愛情與讐恨，歷史文化的傳統的遺產，宇宙間可能的新發現，科學上可能的新發明，他日無一不屬之於現代的兒童。但在現代，究竟還是現代成人的現代；即使有關兒童的一切，還是繫於現代成人，還得向現代的成人說。雖在今日兒童節，說些兒童事，亦不能例外。</p>
<p>每一個嘗過人生甜酸苦辣的成人，或滿足目前的何種美滿際遇，或憧憬著方來的何種曼妙境界，對於嬉戲眼前的兒童，覺得他們是小天使，是後一代的主人翁。或回想自己父母之溫暖的懷抱，慈愛的光暉，則又覺得自己的兒童時代纔是自己的黃金時代。如此「覺得」，不問是否十分準確，卻於不知不覺之間，已經維持了既往千百代的代代相傳，更將因代代如此覺得而維持今後的子子孫孫。然而問題卻在現代。究竟現代的成人，亦予現代兒童以黃金時代沒有？現代情況之下，雖每人期許兒童是後一代的主人翁，然則時有太多太強烈太慘酷的動嚮，正在陷自己的兒童爲先天的小奴才，壓迫他族的兒童爲自己的小奴才。一切精神的物質的方面，儼然具備其爲小天使的條件之兒童，當然有之，但舉世不過萬千之一吧！逢此兒童節，孰不樂爲兒童祝福，然此年此節，正是絕大多數的兒童遭遇非常厄運難的時候。糖果玩具之類，當然可以逗得不自知其方逢厄難的兒童之天眞一笑，點綴佳節，聊勝於無，自是多多益善，然而何足以解除厄難。</p>
<p>此日此時的兒童厄難，是世界的，絕大多數兒童的厄難；我們卻不能想像有更甚於上海及中國淪陷區域的兒童之厄難者。在世界的他處，犧牲於轟炸與流彈之小生命，最可悲憫，我人自予以最高同情；上海及淪陷區域的兒童現在並不如此犧牲，然而不止如此。就上海言：善堂代殮的兒童棄屍，每日數十乃至數百；死後尚且無以爲殮而不得不棄，可知小生命有生之日如何日日與死神相掙扎！每日數十百誠可駭，尚有未經善堂代殮者，尚有日日與死神掙扎而未死者，當然不在此數十百之內，蓋不知是何鉅數也。已死或將死者誠鉅數，僅免於死而勉強生存者必爲數更鉅。仰母乳以爲生，仰殘羹以爲生，仰人偶爾施捨以爲生；學爲小竊，學爲路刦，所竊所刦乃一糕一餅之微，卻幸被竊被刦者以及警務人員之憐憫寬恕以爲生；如此兒童，到處可見，然難想像獲見於上海之外。遠遠的離開了現實，悠悠然歌唱著眼前小天使，日後主人翁，我們祗覺痛心之極，再鼓不起絲毫勇氣來湊這一個趣。</p>
<p>或以爲那是社會最悽慘的一角雖不是一般社會的代表，然至少是一般社會所應最急予救濟的一角。至於上海一般社會的兒童，若以現代一般所謂兒童問題來衡量，亦夠氣短。如與兒童問題有連帶關係的所謂優生問題與優生政策，人口問題與生育獎勵政策，姑且置之兒童問題之外。直接有關兒童者，積極之敎育問題，營養問題等等，皆極平凡而重要，但在今日的上海，言之尚嫌其太奢。有爲各國所重視，其理論研究與實際的調查及措施，皆以登堂入奧，而針對上海社會尤所必要者，如兒童犯罪問題；此在上海，徒見上海是敎導兒童犯罪的一所規模宏大無與倫比的露天學校而已。</p>
<p>一切兒童問題，皆是成人的問題；上海特別嚴重的兒童問題，是一般上海人應該特別負責的問題；在現狀之下，我們當然不奢望亦不奢談上海兒童的一切問題；應如何亟謀解答，然每一成人各有其接觸兒童的最多機會，斯但望每一成人各就所接觸，作最善的努力。若說他日的上海，便是現代上海兒童的上海，則現代上海人至少必知坐視上海前途交托於罪犯露天學校之非計！兒童無罪，罪在成人。</p>

<h3>歐戰業談（四三）　戰時德國的內幕</h3>
<p>柏林廷築最精的坊空室屬於希特勒所有。據專家的意見，他無論如何總不至於炸死在這裹的。這防空室離地面甚深，全部是加料的鋼骨水泥所築成，裹面裝有自動通風機與發電機，一個私人電影放映室，和醫療上用的開刀間。即使英機的炸彈把總理府夷為平地，所有由地室通至外面的路好像都已被炸斷了，但是希特勒和他的僚屬，却仍能從地道中的一條路綫，由防空室跑至幾白碼以外的地方，很安全的由地下昇至地面來。希特勒的防空室中設有很寬暢的臥室，這是一個車要的設計，（所惜他們對於其地防空室中沒有注意到這一點），因為德國人由失眠所受的損失，較之央國飛機的轟炸還大呢。</p>
<p>去年秋季一個時期中，歐洲幾個小政客齊集柏林，有的聽取最後吩咐，有的却來「拔拔瞄頭」，想在希特勒所得的禁膥之中，弄些油水。其中有些人回返各本國京城時，深信柏林決不致被炸（戈林曾以此語自豪），其實這是欺人之談。西班牙外長蘇納即法朗哥將軍的連襟，為人謙和可親，此時曾在柏林大事遊覽，及其返國之時，幾乎要帶了這種報告同去。最後他總算沒有這樣做，遭倒要歸功於美國報紙的通訊員們了。</p>
<p>事緣美國新聞記者坐在阿特隆旅館之中，眼見得那位蘇納先生就要回到為德里去，勢必對法朗哥說，他勾留柏林十個漫漫長夜中，這京城上空從來沒有發現過一架英國艱機，英國人簡直什麽都完了，這時候正是西班牙搭進軸心班子的最好機會。有些新聞記者已在他們所能的電報中暗示出這種意思。最後，在蘇納離開柏林的前夜，英空軍却光臨柏林了。郭培爾和幾位國社黨要人，這晚正在阿特隆旅館中歡宴道位西班牙要人。在還沒有上甜品之前，道個盛筵竟就草草終塲，所有貴賓和陪客，一古腦兒都跑到理髮舖子隔壁阿特隆旅館中寬大的地室之中，躲避在那裹直到大亮四點鐘綫「出土」呢。</p>
<p>義大利外長齋亞諾也會在理髮舖子隔壁的地室中渡過一夜。嗣後英機對於柏林外交方面的冠蓋來往總是特別注意，雖然他們所揀的並不一定是個王道吉日。蘇聯外長莫洛托夫蒞臨柏林的那一晚，許多人以為英國飛機一定不肯放鬆這個機會，那天晚上李本特洛甫以國賓相待，款以盛宴，所有國社黨中的頭兒腦兒，除了希特勒之外，幾乎所有的上將，和陸海空軍中的高級軍官，沒有一個不到塲。我還記得當天傍晚總理公署若干官員的不安情狀，他們深恐道樣一個壯嚴盛宴，要是在炸彈威脅之下搬到地室中去舉行，豈非要弄成一個大話柄。那天晚上，英機倒並未出現。第二天晚上，德國官員赴蘇聯大使館宴會時，他們却老實不客氣的結隊而來了。戈林於事前會命令麾下，一接到英空軍飛入德境的　報後，務須立刻通知柏林當局，以便在市區中發出空襄警報之前，所有的賓客能提早半小時溜走。據在塲者稱，空襲發生時莫洛托夫不願步入地室中去，却在一個黑洞洞的窗子裹，仰着勃子看那天空中所放的花　流星。那天晚上，英國飛機很謹愼地沒有在市區中心擲下炸彈，因之沒有發生什麽大岔于呢。</p>
<p>柏林所受英國空軍轟炸的損害，比較尚少。初到柏林的遊客，很可以在商業及住宅區初徊數小時之久，而看不見一所被炸毀的房屋。受轟炸的屋子恐怕還不到五百之數，而且多數被襲的房屋，在一個月內即已修理完整，住戶重行遷入。英機所轟炸的地方以城郊各工廠為多。伯林市西北郊西門子電機廠與海恩格爾及亨士却爾飛機廠所在的地區，實為柏林市區中最重要的轟炸目標，英國空軍已屢决想要炸到它們而甘心。有幾天晚上，它們確會被炸，這里一個機器工塲，那邊一處堆貨綫房受到損毀。但是所可疑的，在被轟炸的那一天之中，這些廠中所出的軍備，數量的减少，恐怕還不到總數百分之五。最近我會駕車行經其地，聽到廠裹的大機器照樣在那裹軋軋地開着，而且從外表上看來，一些也不發現有受損的樣子。自去冬十一月中，英機集中轟炸愛森地方的克虜伯砲廠以來，至今我還未臨具地。但是我所深信的一位美國新聞記者，事後會前去觀察過，他對於那里所受空襲損害之小，表示驚奇。</p>
<p>這件事眞叫在德國的觀察家有些莫明其妙了，因為克虜伯砲廠的一個大鎔爐是建築在露天的，照理，航空隊員夜間在空中是很容易發見的哩。</p>
<p>據我目下所知，英機對着柏林市內的住宅區或商業區從未有過一次可怕的轟炸。英機因為炸不中鐵道，車站，而至波及附近的墓園以至醫院之事，誠亦有之。漢堡的大海港和造船所，雖曾被炸，但不甚烈，當我去秋往遊其地時，深覺這個德國第二都市的心臟，實院上未受損害。城市中心區被炸最劇的恐怕要推慕尼克。多數毀損之處係十一月八日晚間一夜之中所造成，希特勒是夜在魯溫堡啤酒窟中為一九二三年起事紀念而演說，話剛說完，即來了一次大轟炸。可是這一次英空軍也並未去找尋那啤酒塲，不過中位於城中心的火車站和電氣發動的車輛調節塲等外，擲以炸彈而已。附近有幾所屋子亦遭池魚之殃。</p>

<h3>糧食　洋米湧到　市價略疲</h3>
<p>洋米接連來滬、太古公司太原輪由香港裝來洋米七千二百零一包、又苞米一千包、昨晨抵埠，停靠法租界本行碼頭起卸、又浙江輪亦於昨日到滬、亦由香港運來洋米二千七百六十六包、停靠浦柬本行碼頭起卸、夏老臣洋行經理之永貞輪、由仰光運米來滬、原定昨日到埠、但至晚尚未見進口、據該公司稱、因特殊關係行駛較緩、的須遲一二日到滬、確定日期因該輪無報告、故不能指定、（祖）</p>
<p>洋米存底逐步加增、到頭源源不絕、一般囤日元借假定貨與船隻困難而作為抬價之工具既難依恃、而供過於求更足以證明市價之不易禺昂、因此新國觀望不前、獲利多頭亦急於了結、開市裕賣氣極濃、市面立里不支下垂、小絞英華司原包　開一百廿九元者昨巳跌開一百什五六元路貨祇一百廿四元、均比前市小去三四元、午後進戶更呆、行情喊低近元而乏受主、現貨市石交易雖見活潑、然在浮多競脫之下、高次各擋莫不逐步下趨、一號暹　二號西貢開價一百十元、中决一百〇八元八角至一百〇八元、又二號的一百〇七元至一百〇五元半、火絞一百〇七元、小絞一百〇四五元、此之前市各小二三元、下午疲而乏交、後市或須再度趨疲、全日成交現米一萬包、原包四五百噸、觀以上各價貨、優劣相差無幾、即以一號西貢與小絞而論、距離僅區區二元左右、是誠不堪想象者也、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、其來源因邇來價格一再下游、搬運者遭受虧蝕、多所停手、遂告寥落、貨主亦為顧全身本計、不願再事輕脫、扳持極力、故雖本鄉店銷不暢、市面未起變化、而呈定局、所開各價與前悉屬相仿、無甚榮辱、</p>

<h3>粉市起伏甚微</h3>
<p>麵粉　現洋粉市况、因連日客幫實銷平淡、本街方面既有平賣粉逐日供應、需胃更見呆懈、且邇來雜糧市面平靜、投機團戶均懷觀望之態、所以粉價起伏甚微、花烏及鐘樓牌澳粉價開二十九元一二角至二十九元、金龍牌坎粉終以存到兩充、一漲即平、價　二十八元八角回至二十八元六角半、成交不足萬包、市面猶在醖釀中、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日市塲呆頓如常、蓋目下現貨久乏、概稱有市無貨、除日廠方面、偶有附近零星到貨、門市收進外、絕無整額交易、售價仍為四十五六元、亦在醖釀之中、</p>

<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌仍平、英美匯暗市、潛勢稍形鬆弛、蓋十時許市上突傳日皇召回松岡之說、投機商賣意陡萌、塞出五月期美匯、約有七八十萬美元之巨、致一度五月份美匯五元三一二五可結、然匯豐有利等外行吃胃殷健、華行亦吸、故結果現貨與本月雖告微鬆、而五月期貨則告平平、收盤現貨與本月均為三辦士二五及五元三一二五、五月份則告三辦士二三四三七五及五元二八一二五、</p>
<p>投機出期美匯</p>

<p>市况遂見鬆弛</p>
<p>後市投機商續來拋空、而洋商搶客亦塞、然滙豊等吃胃復佳、市勢期貨反形走緊、計做開五月份美滙五元三一二五、斯時若向之結進、已要五元二八一二五、人後交易漸减、為狀平定、結果收盤、英金三辦士二五、美匯五元三一二五、五月份英金三辦士二三四三七五、美滙五元二八一二五、較上日現貨與四月英長〇一五六二五、美硬〇三一二五、五月份則均榮辱不分、</p>

<p>紐的棉市、晨初市况靜而堅、唯續後突因大衆買進、及美棉有百分之七十五貸款之消息、從華盛頓傳來而猛挺不已、結果收槃價格、較之上日高漲六至十力磅音不等、</p>

<p>胖皮取昨市頗形堅昂、不論素色·條子·格子·點花等、趨勢俏俐異常、因到存缺乏、且因胖皮取為完全生毛織成、非有彈力性不為貴、故本廠貨尚無織出問世、市貨因之更缺、而銷路方面、則為暑季所不可少、故本客幫服裝店、成皆必備、邇來實銷已多上市、顧客先後早有問津訂定、各西服裁縫幫、齊有購進、昨福泰一萬四千號素色條子胖皮取、每碼躉批悉售二十六元五角、聞共開出計有五百餘碼云、</p>

<h3>變更工董名額　須中國政府批准　三國領事仍在磋商辦法　華人對新支配均抱遺憾</h3>
<p>咋（三日）晨聞諸可靠方面、駐滬英美日三國總領事刻正進行磋商而準備擬定更變工部局董事名額之決議草案、俾於四月十七日納稅人特別大會中提出此案、消息靈通人士頃稱、決議案非至納稅人大會通過、不致披露其細則、聞此案若經納稅人核准、將呈交對華締的各國與中國政府批准、至於提建此案之三國總領事、將取何種步騾、以獲得中政府對工董名額變更之允准、昨晨未能確悉、因目前締的各國除日本外、莫不承認重慶政府為中國之合法政府也、</p>
<h3>顯與地皮章程牴觸</h3>
<p>字林報云、公共租界納稅華人方面、雖極明瞭彼等與工部局目今遭遇之困難、但對工部局董事名額、在各國僑民間分配之新比率、均加反對、據稱、工部局總辦費利溥所宣佈之新辦法、乃與洋涇浜地皮章程之規定相牴觸、預料中政府對此將提抗議、蓋工部局之行動、須以原經中政府批准之洋涇浜地皮章程為基礎也、</p>
<p>合法華董　應予維持</p>
<p>由於局勢之變遷、彼等與工部局固有許多困難、須加克服、但望工部局將盡其所能、維持合法再度膺選的華董之地位、至於留滬華董三人、現遇變遷之局勢、將如何行動以應付之、彼等尚無所知、查工部局華董五人中巳有兩人離滬、而工部局董事新比率則許華董佔四席、納稅華人會將吾推選另一新華董、負責方面拒不披露、聞香港路公共租界納稅華人會之重要文件與檔案、均已移去、納稅華人方面、現恐某方或將以現任華董乃非法再度膺選為理由、而圖另派華董、惟正統納稅華人會力言華董均係依法冉度膺選</p>
<p>或將遭遇　相當困難</p>
<p>惟工董名額變更事、日僑旣佔重大關係、地皮章程則規定此種情事、必須商諸中國政府而得其核准、故料工董名額變更事、或將遭遇困難、關於此點、聞英美日總領事於現行磋商中或將加以討論、而獲滿意之解決辦法、</p>
<p>葡僑認為　應得一席</p>
<p>駐滬葡總領事梅洛昨晨吿記者稱、工董名額、若有變更、渠當竭其所能、為葡僑候選人獲取董事一席、渠對工董選舉事、與其他多數總領事抱同樣態度、希望對此問題能獲各方均感滿意之解決、同時、旅滬葡僑對於工董選舉事、今日益感關懷、咸盼葡僑代表可佔董事一席、聞此間葡僑共有六千人、乃旅滬最悠久的僑民之一、葡人終生僑居上海者頗多、葡僑方面認有被推為候選人可能者、有德為理律師·路利（路利公司）·及蘇柴（怡和洋行）等數人、</p>
<p>局董名額　支配沿革</p>
<p>按工部局自一八七三年起、會有德董一人、一九一一年德華銀行經理費琪任德董、蟬聯至一九一四年世界大戰爆發、費琪之董事席山華俄道勝銀行經理傑齊爾斯基續任、至一九一八年杪、德董一席取消、而規定英董七、美日董各一、翌年、美董增至二席、一九二七年日董亦增至二席、英董减至五席、維持迄今、日僑於一九一六年首决推董事入工部局、對央董六、美日俄董各一、</p>
<h3>西報對上海局勢　有焦慮的表示　上海殆將為日本囊中物</h3>
<p>昨日英文大美晚報社論、對於本屆局董人數變更之協定、有所論列、題為「工部局協定、」其文略謂…本屆工部局董事人數、巳由英美日三總領事建議為英美日各據三席、德人一席、其他國籍二人、由此觀之、此後各項爭議、將為英美團體六票、與德日軸心團體四票相對抗自為事實所當然、而德人得此一席、不但為本埠德僑所大喜過望、抑亦希特勒所夢想不到、是則德董對工部局此後之議案、目前因與日本沆　一氣、將來自當以柏林之訓令為依歸、至於華董四人、此後所遭遇種種之恐嚇威脅、自在意料之中、惟究以個人之勇氣如何而定、過去彼等之立塲、甚屬完善、將來則尚未能逆料、其他國籍之二人、似握有一議案之表決權、若雙方票數相同、復由主席表決、然成為問題者、即其他國籍二人、苟此二人乃立於同盟方面之國家、例如挪威或荷蘭、則遇有日本提出激烈之議案時、彼等自與英美採回一態度、雖然在某種情形下、希特勒或將使其本國一加轉變、此間人民態度亦即轉變、結果將有助終日本、藍目前歐洲國家、今日稱為中立國人民、明日或將成為難民矣、即如瑞士·葡萄牙或瑞　等國人民、現時固可加入為英美團體、不數日又何嘗不可被迫受命終日董、總之、茍日本欲控制全槃局勢、英美須注意此「其他國籍二人」之人選、俾於加入主席之表決權後、可獲得多數之票數也、今英美一方有否作此計劃、吾人固未知悉、然本埠人民、巳恐懼上海將成日本吃囊中物矣、日本在工部局應獲有公平之代表及合理之發言權、吾人固亦同情、今日本苟以目的既達、共同遵守新現狀、則自浜北而來之憤怒不平之詞、此後自可無聞、若日本仍效希特勒之行為、飽食以後、又希冀復獲一羹、是則際此各事未屆解決之時、吾人殊不欲再有讓步、日本當知無處可尋獲一願意犧牲之人也、</p>
<h3>法租界節减電流　三項根本原則　電車等公用事業不减電　特殊重要廠家節電較輕</h3>
<p>法簡水電公司自於上月十五日發出通告、勸吿界內工商主戶、切實遵行減電辦去、以今後柴油來原不易、自動節省電流减低銷耗、對於路招霓紅燈等類所耗電流允應節省、公司決將此類市招之用電停止供給、並規定工商住戶、在可能範園內、凡用電量超過五百度以上者、均應依照去年同月所用電量減去百分之三十、此為節省電流之臨時辦法、</p>
<p>根本辦法</p>
<p>公司方面對於减電之根本辦法、正則法公董局與公司當局所設之節省電流會予以研究、第一、對於電熱、將設法取消、第二、對於工商非必要之電流、經詳細調查後、亦予取消、第三、公司採取切實方法、依照公司去年同月供給界內整個電流、能予節省百分之三十為標準、此三項為節電之根本原則、至群紙辦法、該會定日內開會討論確定、</p>
<p>减電份量</p>
<p>最近界內用電量最鉅者、厥為規模較大之　家、如棉織廠、絲織厰、橡膠廠、製蛋廠、冷藏廠、麵粉廠、麫包廠等、今後節電、雖決定减少界內用電量百分之三十、但對麫粉廠、麫包廠、冷藏廠等、節電較輕、而其他非屬特殊重要之廠家、則减電量較重、工商店家、以其用電量之多少而分、如住戶用電素省、亦望儘量減少、有關公用事業如電車等、仍照原有用電量、不予節减、</p>
<p>勸吿節省</p>
<p>該公司現對於界內耗電最鉅之廠商用戶、已有限制規定、惟對於住戶用電、則以手續繁瑣、調查需時、尚未有辦法規定、公司方面、希望用戶體諒公司維持苦衷、自動節省、儘量減低銷耗量、使公司渡過困難時期、减電辦法、係為市民着想、係整個社會問題、萬一將來柴油來源斷絕、公司無法維持、則市民將受痛苦更甚、故盼界內市民熱烈贊助、</p>
<p>柴油存底</p>
<p>公司目下消耗柴油數量每月約一千噸以上、均由外商經手向國外購入、數量較减電前已形遞减、至於柴油存底、敷數月之用、故减電之舉、實屬異常必要、目下全市用戶為五禽戶、其中消耗最多者、為大中華橡膠廠、茂昌冷氣公司、競新染色廠、及棉織絲織專廠家、記者詢以法租界電流不够供給、少數用戶、須向公共租界上海電力公司購買一節、據稱、此事已有一十年之久矣、</p>
<h3>穩定民食　標本兼施</h3>
<p>昨據當局負責者稱、兩當局現巳分鬥別類、議定辦法、決將標本兼施、疏通國內外米糧來源、並對於米商行號客互相買賣、亦將重行整頓、日內或可付睹</p>
<p>分配訂米</p>
<p>上海食糧合作協會、對於已成交訂米、莫不積極設法疏通、運　分配與各訂戶、茲第四批訂米業巳分別抵埠、第一批四八五包三月十八日抵達此間、第二批四八八包三月二十八日抵達此間、現已分配四六四包、至於已登記者、共達二一〇八戶、合計一、一五七〇包、現尚木成交</p>
<p>公倉催款</p>
<p>公倉管理委員會額定儲米二十萬包、其中八萬包小絞米已先行成交、可於五月初裝輪運滬進倉儲藏、該會對於各業已認定數額而未繳款者、催繳頗不遺餘力、茲悉（一）錢兌業一萬包尚未繳款、（二）棉花業二千包函催迄未據復、（三）華成二千包款尚未完全繳足、（四）南洋已函請認儲二千包、迄米函復、（五）紙業前會去繭請其認儲四千包、計半數十七萬元、未據函復、（六）機器染織業雖已認定而未繳足款項、該會將再函催、</p>
<p>洋米價跌</p>
<p>本市整個民食、自經兩租界當局積極設法穩定以還、一般持貨國戶、巳感膽寒、恐洋米來源湧至、米價轉趨劇跌、屆時難免遭受意外損失、蚓評價已無形取銷、顯已無何的束、爰巳紛將囤貨應市、市塲洋米現貨不無增多、昨日米市塲開做後、人心至為穩定、市况已較前市好轉、結果國洋米糧背道而馳、（一）洋米已較諸前市下落二元左右、（二）國米則反較前市升起一元、</p>
<h3>郭順在滬　傳仍將赴港</h3>
<p>工部局華董郭順、外傳已離滬赴港、第據大通社記者探悉、郭氏現尚留滬、惟不久或確將離滬、大通社記者並終昨晨赴靜安寺路一四〇〇號郭氏庽邸探誼、門禁頗嚴、宅外駐有探捕多名、郭庽閣者表示、郭氏並未離滬、惟拒見任何賓客、又據另一消息、郭氏不久確將離滬赴港、</p>

<h3>美經濟專家　評論日本戰時經濟　無法解決內在與外來困難　生活標準低下更無法榨取</h3>
<p>美國著名經濟專家羅培、最近在新聞週報發表一文、分析日本之經濟情形、其結論認最後結果、日本終將不濟、</p>
<p>現代戰爭　基於經濟</p>
<p>據羅氏稱、在各參戰之世界强國中、日本所遭遇之戰時經濟問題、最足表現經濟問題在現代戰爭中、實有決定性、日本所得之教訓、在其他國家、當可作為殷鑑、</p>
<p>英德兩國　困難解決</p>
<p>現戰事經濟之主要問題、德國厥為如何設法增加本國之生產品、英國厥為如何向國外採購物品、而日本則須同時解決內在與外來之困難、德央兩國、前者賴其管理之嚴密、已將生產問題解決、英國則賴其財富、不難購得其所需要之物品、故困難亦已解決、</p>
<p>日本仍屬　一籌莫展</p>
<p>而日本則迄今仍屬一籌莫展、先論日本國內生產問題、日本亦會採用統制辦法、但其主要器械、並不良好、且無法使其改善、以其勞工與德國之技術工人相較、亦相差遠甚、而其生活標準、復非常低下、無可再加榨壓、以供軍用、故日本雖企圖仿效德國之先例、增加國內之生產量、恐亦無多大之成效可言、</p>
<p>未能獲得　國外借款</p>
<p>以言自國外採購物品、日本亦不能輿英國相提並論、日本既無衆多之黃金及外酒準備、又不能向外國獲得信用借款、在此種情形下、日本將遭遇何種結果、明眼人不難想見也、（載行將出版之密勒氏評論報）</p>

<h3>兒童節與育兒常職</h3>
<p>三十年的兒童節，又在熱烈的情緒下展開，雖然慶祝的方式，年年各異，可是慶祝的意義，並無一致。社會人士，對於這種運動的認識，與年並進；而參加慈幼工作者亦與日俱增，百年樹人的遠計，眞是社會進步的現象，也是我民族國家復興的徵兆了。作者每喜就育兒常識為做父母的反覆申述，當茲佳節，更希望舉國兒童，都有健康的身體，謹就管見所及，貢獻一二給世之為父母者。</p>
<p>（一）要避免疾病的傳染　兒童身體組織嬌嫩，對病菌抵抗力薄弱，容易感染疾病。所以第一勿使接近仟何有病之人勿至人烟稠密之處，乳母及看護小孩之人，須擇身體健康者。如母親或乳母偶息傷風咳嗽，當哺乳之時，要用手巾或嘴套，圍着口部。切勿用嘴對着小孩的嘴，或和小孩接吻。勿噹小孩吃的東西，至終在口裹嚼過之物，再給小孩吃，那更不合衛生。日常小孩用的假奶頭，及玩具等物，必須洗滌淸潔後，方可入口。小兒生出後，如父母有肺病者，應立刻隔離，一個人當咳嗽打嚏的時候，須用手巾，或手掌蓋着口部。痰液切勿隨地亂吐，痰盂內注人百分之五的石炭酸水，可以殺癆菌，不致傅染他人。病人須有疾病道德，所謂「尸所不欲，勿施於人」，對於一個幼小體弱的嬰兒，允當格外以加注意。</p>
<p>（二）多取新鮮空氣與日光當風和日麗的天氣，即方滿一個月之小孩，已可帶到公花園裹，每天作二小時的戶外生活，每見一般人，常常怕小孩吹風，因為怕風的綠故，連臥室空氣，也不使流迎，半了疾病，更是窗門緊閉，帳幔重重。其實我們只要頭上戴了帽子，身上穿得暖暖的，即有冷空氣吹來，往鼻腔進入肺部，中間經過氣管，冷空氣已由冷而溫，並不使人受凉，亦不致因此而傷風，傷風的原因，決不在此。作者前在德國時，目見一個痳疹（俗名出痧子）的小孩，同時患了肺炎，他們拿那個小孩，頭上身上包得暖暖的，臥之於廊下或花園內，因為有充分的新鮮空氣，不數日肺炎愈了，痳疹當然也無問題了，在這樣的空氣之下，痳疹的肺癆，（俗名痧癆）當然是不會有的。這種情形，我國人聽了，或將以為我在說夢話，可是這明明是事實，有人說歐洲人與我國人體格不同，不過根據實情，鑒於我國小孩痳疹死亡率之多，也應當改良改良，在可能範圍內，使多得到一些新鮮空氣！還有一九三四年維也納一個小兒科醫院內，有了兩個雙生子同時息百日咳，醫生拿一個小孩，不用任何藥物，而置之於露天本氣裹，另一個小孩關在屋裏，完全只用藥物，結果，終日在露天空氣內者好得快。再有從數百個小孩中統計，到了鄉間，在大自然之下，體重日增，到了城市，雖天天吃補品，體重還是減輕，這都是給我們一個明證，空氣日光，對於我人，猶魚之於水，不可或少。</p>
<p>（三）如何謂之營養　營養充足，可以使自身生抵抗力而減少疾病，但是在這百物飛漲的年頭，我們也當顧到經濟方面，所以肉類太貴，可以吃波菜豆腐代之，牛奶太貴，可以吃豆腐漿代之，水果太貴，可以用素英湯代之。食物不要只顧自已喜歡，而忘了營養的原質。一個已滿一歲或將要二歲的小孩，倘仍只吃乳汁，這不是眞正愛子之道，那種單方面的營養，可以使小孩陷於十分衰弱的地方，因此疾病叢生。一個滿一個月之小孩，每日除乳汁外，再給以橘子汁，（番茄汁及素菜湯均可代之）及開水，滿二三個月之小孩給以魚肝油（四至六星期）之久，至五六個月後每日加入糊樣食物，如粥，山芋，波菜猪肝等都可以做成糊樣而餵之，那麼到十個月後，就不期然而然的斷乳了。一個人在生病的時候，也應當注意病中的營養，大多數人家，平時只顧亂吃，一旦發了熱，有了病，什麼飲食都停止了，其實我人當發熱的時候，維他命及各種營養的消耗很多，必要有相當的補充，纔可以抵抗疾病。民間對於患痳疹的小孩，食物限止極嚴，澴說要吃四十天的凈素，以至滋養缺乏，肺癆等症，即乘虛而入，所以當患病的時候，也應當聽醫生的囑咐，注意到營養方面，從大體講，凡輕軟，流動，新鮮，有滋養而易消化的食物，仍是可以吃的。兒童食物，不但資其生活，更藉以發育身體，較成人允為重要。</p>
<p>愛我愛以及人之愛，幼我幼以及人之幼，世之子女無恙，衣食充足者，希望盡我力之所及，救濟無衣無食而有病之兒童，兒童節每年雖僅一天，而我們所需要努力的日子，却永遠無窮無盡。質之賢明的父母們，以為如何？（蘇曾祥）</p>

<h3>孩子的敎</h3>
<p>— 覺慧</p>
<p>兒童節——孩子的節日；然而「大人」很有一提之必要。</p>
<p>所謂「養不敎，父之過。」設敎而涉於荒唐，則較「不敎」尤「過」也！</p>
<p>往往，孩子連國家領袖是誰，爲甚麽要作戰都不懂；而跳草裙舞是怎末一回事，麻將牌一百幾十隻，卻反而明白得「清清楚楚」。這樣下去，眞夠嗚呼！</p>
<p>不敎，不懂也就罷了；敎而涉於荒唐，懂雖懂，懂的是邪道，不是正路。</p>
<p>不懂，不過是不懂；懂人邪道，則孩子一生，完啦！</p>
<p>再者：「敎不嚴，師之惰。」現在小學敎員「枵腹從公」的正多著……（下文爲「大人」者自然知道。）</p>
<p>孩子，天眞未鑿，什麽都一敎就會的。敎得好，成大器；敎得不好，危險危險！</p>
<p>特別是「闊老大人」，願有以三思之，百思之！</p>
<h3>送孩子進托兒所</h3>
<p>— 萍孃</p>
<p>她是個敎師，也是個寫作者，但是，家裏有三個未及學齡的孩子，這能容許她做什麽事呢？敎了書回去，不是大孩子跌破了頭，就是小毛頭吃壞了肚子。雖然每個孩子有阿媽有奶嬸嬸帶領，但一則她們沒有衛生常識，沒有敎育素養，二則她們背了主婦，難免要偷懶疏忽，甚而至於虐待。她的丈夫常常取笑她說：「捨己之田，芸人之田」，有時甚至於笑她「好爲人師」。在這種環境之下，她只好捨棄了敬愛她的學生，爲孩子犧牲了她的職業——而也是事業。</p>
<p>她於是坐鎭在家裏，至少她想：她可以從事於寫作。但是，請看她的寫作生涯罷：剛一拿起筆，二足歲稍過最歡喜跟隨母親的孩子，「姆媽姆媽」的喊來了。他拿了筆，也爬到寫字檯上來問媽要紙來寫字，剛給了他紙，命令他在小桌子上寫字，（其實是亂畫符）暫得安靜一下時，奶嬸嬸又換了哭著的小毛頭來了，非要同媽親近一下不可。剛剛打發開，大孩子拿了畫報來要媽講故事給他聽。這樣，那樣，三個孩子川流不息的纏住了她，她何嘗能寫得下一個字？她記起了她朋友告訴她的話：杜君勤於寫作，她那一本婦女問題的專書，就是在三四個孩子包圍之下寫的，而且她經濟窘迫，沒有一個帶領孩子的阿媽。我那時身邊沒有一個孩子，聽了也並不奇怪。現在想來，那眞是奇跡！也許是我那位朋友，爲了鼓勵我寫作，編湊出來的一段故事。要不然，除非那些孩子都是被壓迫得呆若木雞的。</p>
<p>她不甘心就爲孩子斷送了一生。雖然很有些人會拿「家事與社會事業一樣重要」，「敎育自己的孩子，就等於在社會上從事敎育，功蹟非小」這些話來勸慰她，但她覺得那都是聊以解嘲之談而已！</p>
<p>她把大孩子送入了幼稚園——以遊戲爲重，並不死讀書的幼稚園，三足歲的人，就權充了四足歲。帶他的人，就專管接送等事。經濟上只會加多支出，人力上也並不能因此減少一個僕人，但母親卻算已解除了一部分糾纏。這樣經過了一年光景。</p>
<p>現在最成問題的是第二個了，他既已能行動自由，什麽東西都要翻，無論是爸爸的，媽嗎的。因爲自己灑茶，敲破了茶杯；因爲洗好臉學裝扮，把所有的雪花膏爽身粉打翻在地上；因爲要理髪，把凡士林塗得滿頭滿臉滿手掌；因爲要把鎳幣放到撲滿裏，母親的皮箧老被洗刧一空；因爲與哥哥弟弟搶東西，大哭大叫；因爲被祖母養成了吃糖吃閑食的習慣，時時刻刻要吵東西吃：因爲被父親養成了不打不聽的習慣，對好言好語不易接受。大家都說他最淘氣，媽媽卻相當的同情他，理解他，也便要化更多的時間去應付他，因此送走了一個，對於媽媽還是沒有幫助。</p>
<p>恰巧女青年會創辦了一個「職業婦女托兒所」，她覺得她現在雖不能算是職業婦女，但正因爲孩子問題不解決，才把自己關住在家裏的。她何嘗甘心情願爲孩子斷送一生，只苦的孩子太小，沒地方好送。現在既然有了托兒所，她正可以解決最牽累她的孩子於是，首先去報了名。</p>
<p>進去時是二歲四個月，年紀剛剛適合，身體檢查亦頗健康。三月一日，他就早出晚歸地儼然小學生了。（他不懂得托兒所，只知道進學堂）母親每天把兩個孩子一送出，她眞的得到解放了。可以看看畫報，可以定時寫作，最小的小毛頭，偶然抱抱弄弄，正可以作爲埋頭生活的調節。</p>
<p>她有時很抱歉：也許這一個孩子的麻煩，現在正套在托兒所先生的頭上。但經過一星期，二星期，三星期，據說這個孩子，在托兒所裏並不要她們化去太多的工夫，她們很喜歡他，他也高興去，這位母親，才算眞的解除了一椿心事。</p>
<h3>警告</h3>
<p>— 陵仝</p>
<p>據天文界測騐：本年不但霉期提早，抑且泛潮特甚，爲數十年所木有。此種潮濕氣中，有一種氣質，最易毀壞一切物品，且色多變黑，無法使之乾凈。流質固質氣質一切皆不能抵抗，百物不宜囤儲。對於帶有水質之米糧等類，屆時經化學作用，更有其他變化發現。（見三月二十八日本所，全文抄襲，特此聲明。）</p>
<h3>做父母的責任　兒童節感言</h3>
<p>— 許達明</p>
<p>沒有一個做父母的，不愛護自己的孩子的。但愛護的方法，顯然地，有著各種各樣的不同。有的專以貴重的食物，和名貴的衣頭，以及帶孩子去到處遊玩作爲愛護方法的；有的則在上述二種物質上的愛護之外，另再加上精神上的愛護一一敎養。當然，這兩者在實際上是分不開的，因爲在享受遊玩上，無形中對孩子是更容易印入深刻印象的另一種「敎養」，而且，這種「敎育」徧徧會容易收效，尤其是在父母的「寶貝」「心肝」之下，孩子們是啓於接受的。更且一般家長，差不多全都忽視家庭敎育的重要性，往往是把敎養的這一責任，全部都推到了學校的頭上。好像小孩子除了在學校裏受先生的敎訓之外，做父母的可以不負絲毫責任，因此，孩子在家庭裏也就什麽都做，而學校與家庭之間也就失卻了聯絡，這種現象在今天是必須克服的，因爲這對兒童是一種損失！</p>
<p>其次，家庭不但要與學校取得聯絡，而使自己的孩子能得到眞正的進步，同時，也能在這中間起了另一種作用——督促了敎師對兒童敎育的不能馬虎，因爲家長的詢問，敎師就不能不對小孩子的一切加以注意，而所收得的效果，也是幫助孩子的。更進一步的，要是家長的認識較清的話，他可以在這種機會中熟悉某位先生的思想是否正確，敎育方法是否有改進的必要等等；如果是某一位先生的思想是有問題的話，不妨可以由家長間聯名提出來彈劾，這種是發揚民主精神的方法，做父母的爲了孩子的將來，是必須負起這責任的。</p>
<p>第三，筆者在本刊上曾經看到過一幅插畫，它畫著孩子們在家庭裏所受的「家庭敎育」是這樣的——數學的敎法是「馬將牌」（一到九的萬字，筒子等等），而英文課的敎具是用「撲克牌」（A.K.Q.J.等），於是大人在賭，孩子在旁邊看，甚至有家長還敎孩子這是什麽，那是什麽。</p>
<p>像這樣的父母，我們要提出抗議，這決不是使孩子學好的辦法，相反的，是在葬送你孩子的前途，這種父母是該負起「兒童的罪人」之名的。那末，對這種家長，敎師假如從兒童口中聽到這種情形的話，學校當局也可寫信勸告他們尊重兒童的學業爲重的。</p>
<p>總之，不論學校，父母雙方，都該抱有這一正確的理解——兒童是國家的，是民族的，他決不是你我一己的私有財產。因此，兒童好，是整個民族的好，而不是你自己的「搖錢樹」。我們的敎養孩子，也就是爲了對民族國家盡責任，這最在的前題卻是必須認清的。</p>
<p>至於窮得無法進學校的孩子，我們也不能忽略了他們的敎育，或許在這裏有著很好才幹的兒童，給埋沒了。</p>
<p>所以，筆者順便在此爲苦孩子一呼，盼望社會人士能把敎育苦孩子的事情，也認爲是自身的事情，而加以切實的援助——能多多開辦幾所街童學校之類，恐怕要比幾十萬經費來建築一所兒童圖書館要有用得多吧！何況，這種事情在今天的意義是遠超過兒童圖書館以上的，希望能趕快伸出同情的手來，因爲這不僅是給兒童們的偉大禮品，而且也是爲人父母的人的另一種責任！</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鴿</p>
<p>（六）愛情結晶品</p>
<p>「丈夫，然而我的丈夫是誰呢？袁寶藩，他只是我的殺母之仇，那裏可算是我的丈夫！不錯，他們有錢的人即使娶上三妻四妾，在我們中國，也是天經地義的事，我不能禁止他；可是他要娶小老婆，就該從那些倡伎和別的一般身分適稱的女人中間去找尋，不應該沾污一個清折人家的少女。何況根本又不是兩相情願，而是他用了極卑鄙無恥的手段，佈成了一個騙局，使我們全家鑚進這個圈套的。所以我覺得我不但不是他的妻子，而且也不是他的小老婆，而是給他囚禁起來的一個囚犯！憑著這種種的理由，昨天深晚。我就毫不隱瞞的把我們的事告訴了…—。」</p>
<p>「呀！」秋海棠差一些嚇得失聲高喊來。</p>
<p>「……我母親的亡靈。我燃起了香，虔虔誠誠地在她靈座前默禱了幾十分鐘，現在我的心已完全安定了，而且我相信母親在地下一定也是覺得很安慰的……！」</p>
<p>秋海棠的心也跟著安定了，他不由深深地鬆了一口氣：得意的微笑，也立刻浮到了他臉上來。</p>
<p>「……！從此以後，希望你能夠永遠當我像你家裏的人一樣，我自己也決心永遠愛你；只要有一個機會，我一定會想法子跳出姓袁的樊籠的……！」</p>
<p>他情不自禁地把那幾頁信紙抱在胸前，當它們像一個人一樣的溫存著，好久才放下來再繼續閱看。</p>
<p>「……你的職業和環境都和別人不同，以後行動必須格外謹愼，像他地樣的一個人，是決不會把殺人當做一件事的……。」</p>
<p>湘綺這幾句忠告，實在並不是過慮，秋海棠自己也曾聽袁紹文說過，有一次，袁鎭守使手下有一個辦理文稿的人，私通了他家裏一個丫頭，在發現的一天，便被袁寶藩自己用手槍打死了。說起這個人的老子，還是跟老袁一起在保定當小兵的把兄弟咧！（七二）</p>

<p>新片介紹</p>
<h3>孔雀東南飛</h3>
<p>— 孟公威</p>
<p>「古裝片」潮已經過去了，聽說日前就有好幾個已竣將竣的古裝片拷貝賣不出去。「孔雀東南飛」之改編爲時裝，那是得風氣之先的。</p>
<p>以時裝姿態演出的「孔雀東南飛」，和「孔雀東南飛，五里一裴徊」的古詩是有許多不同的。這不同不祗在服裝上，也在人物的增刪和劇情的變動四，相同者，祗有男女主角的姓名和故事的輪廓而已。</p>
<p>人物的增刪　和故事的變動是有關係的。原詩上的那位小姑這裏是沒有了，卻增加了大舅陸順和長工阿牛，此無他，便於劇情的發展耳。爲了加強氛圍或便於劇情的開展而增刪人物，依我愚見是無所謂的，問題所在，是在是否因此增刪而損傷了原作的精神。</p>
<p>以「孔雀東南飛」言，原詩和影片是有著兩種情調的：原詩的那種婉轉悽涼的情緻在影片上是沒有了，但在影片上卻擴大了視野，增強了社會意義。這種改編方法是功是罪且不去管牠（以我個人愚見，我是同意於與其忠實原作不如忠實時代的），至少限度，在目前的電影傾向上，它是擺脫了把時裝穿在行屍走肉上的假屍還陽的。而這種「假屍還陽」式的所謂時裝片，很有繼「古裝處」而成爲一種新的傾向的事能。</p>
<p>「孔雀東南飛」的原詩是一首在封建社會重壓下的弱者的哀鳴，爲了作者的時代關係，它固然暴露了封建制度所贊成的悲劇，蘊藏著對封建制度的憤怒，但亦祗是止哀鳴而已，呼籲而已；至於「孔雀東南飛」影片，則經過改編，時代背景戶經成爲現在的了，這是改編者最大的聰明處，也是最大的好處。固然，像現在這種的對男女間的關係的看法，在若干年之後，也許又要加以修正了，或者，甚至於不可能，也不會再有像焦仲卿和蘭芝的事情發生，但以原詩和影片作一比較，則其中的觀點是有很大的進步的，這也正是時代是永遠在前進著的一個例證。</p>
<p>從劇本的編製和導演手法上來說，「孔雀東南飛」在近頃的國產影片中，也可以列入上乘裏面去了。「孔雀東南飛」本來是一個很動人的故事，加以編導不壞，又是息影已久的胡蝶所領銜主演的，在營業的收穫上，也該是有把握的吧。</p>
<p>胡蝶在本片中的演技，是有著極大的。我們很久沒有在國產影片中看到演員有內心表演的戲了，而在本片中胡蝶有之；我們也很久感到演員的氣度和劇中人的氣度的不能符合了，而本片中的胡蝶則統一之。</p>
<p>至於其他演員，王無龍太蒼老了，動作又失之過火。王乃東的動作是可以了，國語卻不純粹。顧文宗動作及語言化裝等之火，驟視之，幾疑爲是久演廣東戲者。值得一提者倒是李景波的阿牛和白茵的彩蓮，他們演得很稱職。</p>

<h3>平劇伶人演話劇「家」的理想陳容</h3>
<p>— 海</p>
<p>平劇的伶界同志，有不少人對於話劇極感興趣。前年，伶界同志和文化人在卡爾登大戲院聯合演出了一次「雷雨」，就是他和她們的興趣更是增進了，本來預備組織孤魔劇團，並且將初次公演的劇本規定是「寄生草」，但結果沒有實現，是件極可惜的事情。</p>
<p>辣斐劇塲公演馬金的「家」，造成一百二十七塲的客滿紀錄，有不少伶界同志都去看過，對這部紅都非常贊美。我想如果他和她們能夠聯合演出一次「家」，準能轟動一時，並代爲擬訂了一個理想陣容。昨天，在伶聯會保產會歡迎荀　先劇團和慶功宴席上，我提起這件事情，周信芳，高百歲，趙如泉，李如春都極贊同，躍躍欲試，百歲興奮地說：「等荀劇團唱了義務戲以後，就可以籌備演「家」了。現將「家」的理想陣容寫在下面，作爲將來公演時支配演員的參考吧。</p>

<p>第五章　紅裙妒　煞石榴花</p>
<p>當延綏巡撫周奇瑜奉旨討賊的時候總督五省軍務，大權在握，而流寇聲勢也正在擴大，自陜西轉掠山西河南湖廣四川等省，攻陷州縣數十，連古稱天險的夔州也失守了。周奇瑜遂到均州，檄令陜西河南等四巡撫阻逐流寇的四面，大小十餘戰，都能得勝，流寇死得很多，其勢稍挫。於是張獻忠奔避商雒，李自成等卻遁入在興安地方的車箱峽。不料那車箱峽四山巉立，中亘四十里，到了裏面，好如伏處箱中，易入難出。流寇既已誤入，山上居民得知這消息，不勝歡喜，有的把大石下擊，有的將火炬投下，且把石塊堵塞了峽口，以致流寇在峽內生路斷絕，有絕食之虞。更兼老天下了二十天的大雨，流寇弓矢盡脫，馬乏芻秣，死的人很多。倘然再不能出，勢改要餓死峽中了。李自成用了他手下策士之謀，特地遣人冒險出峽，向周奇瑜營前僞爲請降。周奇瑜立下許多大功，未免有了驕心，且爲及早收拾之計，竟貿然允許，於是流寇三萬六千餘人得以絕處逢生。周奇瑜正要把他們編遣歸農，那裏知道賊方出峽，突然間大譟生變，盡殺安撫之官，死灰復燃，又作亂起來了，這是第一次。又有張獻忠的一般暗襲南陽之時，恰逢左良玉，雙方劇戰一塲。獻忠敵不過，率衆逃逸，卻被左良玉追及，兩馬相隔不遠，左良玉張弓搭矢，一箭射去，正中張獻忠的眉心，又一箭中其中指。獻忠不得已，回馬抵禦，又被左良玉一刀劈中面部，血流至肩，險些兒跌下馬來。那時有獻忠部下孫可望力前格拒，方把獻忠救去。良玉在後追至穀城，獻忠遂向督師熊文燦請降。良玉知道賊兵有詐，便向熊文燦獻計，要想將賊兵悉數誘殺人，以杜後患。誰知熊文燦拘於仁義之說，認爲殺降不祥，不肯聽良玉的話。到後來果然張獻忠擁兵素餉，不奉調遣，在穀城重叛，這是第二次失機。足見督兵的庸鄙無能，主撫債事了。（二九）</p>

<h3>Butler Informs Shigemitsu: Close Anglo-American Cooperation to Aid China; Roosevelt to Announce Implementation of Lend-Lease; No Possibility of Reconciliation with Japan Regarding British Actions</h3>
<p>Stockholm: British Foreign Under-Secretary Butler stated yesterday in the House of Commons that Britain and America have closely cooperated to aid China and have notified Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu of this matter. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt's promise of further aid to China at the White House press dinner has yet to show signs of implementation. However, it is expected that an announcement will be made soon, and there is no doubt that China will receive American aid early to cope with its military difficulties. As the European situation may cause the United States to pay more attention to China, economic aid will be given priority. The reports in various newspapers here, with much attention, regarding Chairman Chiang's report at the opening of the Eighth Plenary Session, stating that 70% of China's difficulties are economic and 30% are military, evidently matches the views held by the authorities here. It is said that Mr. Currie, the President's most trusted economic advisor, who recently inspected the free areas of China and wrote a report, is currently under active consideration by the authorities. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>London: British Foreign Under-Secretary Butler stated in the House of Commons tonight that the British government has been watching the Japanese government's attitude towards the rights and interests of foreigners in China and the impact on British trade for some time. Recently, he took this opportunity to call the attention of the Japanese Ambassador to the current situation. The British government feels that this situation is inconsistent with the Japanese government's statements regarding upholding the Open Door policy. Conservative Party member Milner asked whether it is correct to determine that Japan has now violated all its promises regarding the rights and interests of enemies. Butler replied, "On the one hand, we have the statements of the Japanese government, and on the other hand, we have the situation currently developing. The Japanese side claims that its policy has not changed, but the more we pay attention to this situation, the more unsatisfactory it becomes. This is the reason why we took this opportunity to call it to the attention of the Japanese government." (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>London: British Foreign Under-Secretary Butler stated yesterday in the House of Commons that Japan's Open Door policy in China is becoming increasingly unfavorable. He recently called the attention of Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu to this situation, saying, "The British government feels that there is no possibility of reconciliation with Japan's previous protests regarding the Open Door policy in China." Someone asked Butler whether it could be assumed that Japan would once again abide by the various treaties regarding the interests of European countries in China. Butler replied, "Japan issues declarations on the one hand, but on the other hand, there is the evolution of the current situation. Japan's declarations claim that its policy has not changed, but the more one examines the situation, the more one finds it deteriorating. Therefore, it is necessary to urge the Japanese government to pay attention." Someone also asked whether this was being done in cooperation with the United States. He said, "The government is handling matters appropriately." (Associated Press, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Far East Military Leaders Held Meeting in Philippines Yesterday</h3>
<p>Formal Naval and Army Conference to be Held in Cavite. Unofficial Navy Designation, Marshal Brooke-Popham is an Expert in the Air Force, They Believe</p>
<p>Manila: British and American naval and army authorities will continue to hold meetings here today as the most practical action for strengthening British and American defenses in the Far East. British Far East Forces Commander Marshal Brooke-Popham, American Army Philippine Department Commander Major General Grunert, and American High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre will meet this morning. The conversation of Marshal Brooke-Popham after the meeting will be extremely important because of the recent strengthening of the American naval, army, and air forces in Manila and the accelerated construction of air force bases in the Pacific. This meeting is the first real contact between the leaders of the British and American defense forces in the Pacific. Observers predict that British and American authorities will discuss the possibility of the United States using Singapore. Once Japan implements its southward advance and the United States is drawn into wartime, there will be a joint policy of the British, American, and Dutch navies. It is not yet known whether Marshal Brooke-Popham will attend the meeting in Cavite. (Associated Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>Manila: When the British and American Far East naval and army leaders met here this morning, 27 elite American Army fighter planes flew in formation over Manila. (Associated Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>Manila: Tonight, officials here will discuss at a banquet hosted by senior officials in the Philippines the implementation methods for naval and air force cooperation in the event of war in the Pacific. Washington and London have both agreed. The guests invited by American official Sayre in the Philippines are only British Far East Forces Commander Brooke-Popham, American Asiatic Fleet Commander Hart, and American Army Commander in the Philippines Lieutenant General Grunert. Brooke-Popham refused to comment on what he and the Americans had discussed, and American naval and army officials also remained silent. It is said that Brooke-Popham will go to Hong Kong tomorrow and this morning visited Fort McKinley with Lieutenant General Grunert. (Associated Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>Washington: Well-informed sources believe that British Far East Commander Brooke-Popham's visit to Manila is part of a general plan for cooperation in the Pacific. It is believed that Brooke-Popham's visit to the Dutch East Indies further demonstrates British and American attention to the Pacific region. Some observers believe that Brooke-Popham's visit to Manila, coinciding with Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's visit to Berlin and Rome, is a sign of increased British and American strength to cope with the increasingly intensified cooperation of the Axis powers.

<p>London: Burmese Administration Minister Amery declared in the House of Commons yesterday that Britain will build a railway from Lashio (Burma) to the Yunnan border to connect with China's Yunnan-Burma Railway. (Associated Press, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Singapore Overseas Chinese Conference Endorses Government Leaders</h3>
<p>Singapore: The Overseas Chinese Conference in Singapore has ended after three days of meetings. The entire assembly unanimously elected Tan Kah Kee to continue as Chairman of the United Relief War Disaster Fund Federation. The conference cabled the British and American governments, expressing gratitude for their continued assistance to China over the past few years, and cabled the Chinese government leaders, expressing continued support, as well as the commanders of the fighting forces.

<h3>Japanese Troops from Yicheng and Gaoping Reinforce Southern Invasion Unsuccessfully; Japanese Troops North of Wenxi Ambushed; Part of the Japanese Troops South of Pengze Repelled</h3>
<p>Luoyang: The Japanese troops in the area south of Jin City and north of Changgao have been heavily attacked by Chinese forces for days and suffered heavy losses. On the 30th, the Japanese troops reinforced and counterattacked. A part of more than 2,000 troops, divided from Yicheng and Gaoping, advanced south to Dadazhang, Liyi, Zhenpingchuan Village and other areas, but were repelled by the Chinese army, killing more than 200 Japanese soldiers and capturing many supplies. Another part went out from the northeast of Shou City to the north and south of Machun Village to harass, and Chinese forces are intercepting. (3rd)</p>
<p>Xingji: The Japanese troops from Henglingguan East Sangchi advanced to the nearby defense area of China on the morning of the 30th. The Chinese army met them head-on, and the Japanese troops retreated immediately. Also, a part of the Japanese infantry and cavalry advanced along the road from Wulong Temple (north of Wenxi) to Wenxi. When passing near Lingsi Village, they were ambushed by Chinese troops and retreated. (2nd)</p>
<p>Changde: A certain unit of the Chinese army on the north bank set up an ambush near Tailor Shop on the 29th of last month, intercepting the Japanese soldiers and Japanese trucks advancing from Shilipu. After fighting for four hours, nine Japanese trucks were destroyed and many Japanese officers and soldiers were killed. They also seized a Japanese light machine gun, dozens of rifles, multiple pistols, and many documents. (3rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Military news: (1) After the Chinese army retook Gao'an, the war situation in northern Jiangxi has returned to the situation before the 15th. (2) The Japanese army in northern Jiangxi abandoned many guns and weapons in the rivers. The Chinese army is trying to salvage them. (3) The Japanese troops who were defeated from Wuning and retreated to Shengzhuxi, Wangjiapu and other places last month gathered more than 2,000 troops and advanced towards the Daqiao River and Xiajiachong northeast of Wuning. After being attacked by the Chinese army, the battle lasted until the evening of the 24th, killing more than 600 Japanese soldiers. The remnant Japanese troops were defeated and retreated. On the 26th, the original situation was restored. (2nd)</p>
<p>A certain place in southern Anhui: A part of the Japanese troops in Pengze, under the cover of artillery, advanced towards the Chinese troops. After being met with Chinese resistance and fierce fighting for a long time, the Japanese troops were unable to hold out and retreated. The Japanese troops at Malukou (south of Pengze) harassed Songjiazui of China on the 29th, saying that they had been repelled by the Chinese army. (2nd)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Chinese Army Wins a Great Victory</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesman for the Chinese army announced today that the Chinese army has won the biggest victory in recent months on the battlefield southwest of Nanchang. 56,000 Japanese troops participating in the offensive in northern Jiangxi were not strongly resisted by the Chinese army, allowing the Japanese troops to penetrate deeply, and then cutting off the two wings of the Japanese army and repelling their columns. At the same time, the main column of the Japanese army was surrounded. The Japanese army advanced westward in three routes. Although the two wings of the Japanese army were defeated, the central route continued to advance vigorously. Usually, the Japanese army would not take risks. This time, it was obviously imitating the German blitzkrieg offensive, advancing regardless of everything, and relying on airplanes and motorized units to maintain supply. However, when the Japanese army reached Shanggao, the Chinese army intensified the encirclement. (Associated Press, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Belgian Ambassador Arrives in Chongqing from Hong Kong; Foreign Ministry Personnel Welcome at the Airport, to Visit Central Leaders Soon</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Belgian Ambassador to China Baron de Ryckman arrived in Chongqing by plane from Hong Kong at 8:30 a.m. on the 3rd. More than ten people, including Ling Qihan, a Senior Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Archibald, a Counselor of the Belgian Embassy, and Bolo, a Secretary of the French Embassy, welcomed him at the airport. Ambassador Ryckman has been in China for many years. Since the outbreak of the war, he came to Chongqing in the winter of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939) and stayed for more than a month. Last spring, he originally planned to come to Chongqing from Peiping again. Because the European situation was tense and the situation on the Western Front took a sharp turn for the worse, he had to postpone his plan to come to Chongqing. After arriving in Chongqing today, Ambassador Ryckman felt the vibrant spirit of the wartime capital and its rapid progress, and expressed his admiration. It is said that he will soon visit Foreign Minister Wang, Vice Minister Xu, and other officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as government officials, and plans to pay his respects to Chairman Chiang. He will stay in Chongqing for a period of time. (3rd)</p>
<h3>National Cooperative Conference Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday; Chiang and Lin's Instructions Read Out on the Spot, First General Assembly Held in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The National Cooperative Conference convened by the Ministry of Social Affairs opened today. The opening ceremony was held in the morning, with more than 200 people attending.

<h3>Most of the Japanese Troops Stationed in Vietnam Transferred Elsewhere</h3>
<p>Saigon: Most of the 5,000 Japanese soldiers and 200 airplanes left Tokyo last week and went to an unknown location. It is also heard that the Japanese army replaced the latest weapons and artillery in the Haiphong area with old ones. As for the French government's goods in the partitioned area (Laos and Cambodia), they can be evacuated by May 20, at which time Thailand can take over the entire territory.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Children Are Innocent</h3>
<p>Today is Children's Day, a modern holiday, Chinese, and transcending national boundaries to be international.</p>
<p>The international community of the future will inevitably be that of modern children, and the China of the future will inevitably be that of modern Chinese children; in short, everything of the future, whether responsibility, enjoyment, tears or laughter, love and hatred, the historical and cultural traditions and heritage, the possible new discoveries in the universe, and the possible new inventions in science, all belong to modern children. But in the modern era, it is still the modern era of adults; even everything related to children is still tied to modern adults, and must still be said to modern adults. Even on today's Children's Day, saying something about children is no exception.</p>
<p>Every adult who has tasted the sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and spiciness of life, whether satisfied with some kind of happy circumstance at present, or yearning for some kind of wonderful realm to come, feels that the children playing in front of them are little angels, the masters of the next generation. Or recalling the warm embrace and loving light of their own parents, they feel that their own childhood was their golden age. Such a "feeling," regardless of whether it is very accurate, has unconsciously maintained the intergenerational transmission of the past thousands of generations, and will continue to maintain the future generations of sons and grandsons because generations feel this way. However, the problem lies in the modern era. After all, do modern adults also give modern children a golden age? Under modern circumstances, although everyone expects children to be the masters of the next generation, there are too many, too strong, and too cruel trends that are trapping their own children as congenital little slaves and oppressing the children of other races as their own little slaves. Of course, there are children who have all the conditions to be little angels in all spiritual and material aspects, but they are only one in ten thousand in the world! On this Children's Day, who would not be happy to bless children, but this year and this festival are precisely when the vast majority of children are encountering extremely unfortunate times. Candies, toys, and the like can of course amuse the innocent smiles of children who do not know that they are encountering misfortune, decorate the festival, and are better than nothing, and the more the better, but how can they relieve misfortune.</p>
<p>The misfortune of children at this day and this time is the misfortune of the world, the misfortune of the vast majority of children; but we cannot imagine that there is anything worse than the misfortune of children in Shanghai and the occupied areas of China. Elsewhere in the world, the little lives sacrificed in bombings and stray bullets are most pitiful, and we give them the highest sympathy; children in Shanghai and the occupied areas are not being sacrificed in this way now, but it is more than that. Take Shanghai as an example: dozens or even hundreds of abandoned children's corpses are collected by charitable organizations every day; it is not possible to bury them after death and they have to be abandoned, which shows how these little lives struggle with the god of death every day while they are alive! Dozens or hundreds a day is certainly shocking, and there are those who have not been collected by charitable organizations, and those who struggle with the god of death every day but have not died, which are of course not included in these dozens or hundreds, which must be a huge number. Those who are already dead or about to die are indeed a huge number, and those who barely survive without dying must be even more numerous. They live on mother's milk, they live on leftovers, they live on occasional donations from others; they learn to be petty thieves, they learn to be robbers on the road, and the things they steal and rob are only a cake or a cookie, but fortunately the stolen, robbed, and police officers have pity and forgive them so that they can live; such children can be seen everywhere, but it is difficult to imagine seeing them outside of Shanghai. Far away from reality, leisurely singing about the little angels in front of us, the masters of the future, we only feel extremely heartbroken, and we can no longer muster any courage to join in this fun.</p>
<p>Some may think that this is the most tragic corner of society, although it is not representative of the general society, but at least it is the corner that the general society should most urgently give relief to. As for the children of the general society in Shanghai, if measured by the general so-called children's problems of modern times, it is also enough to take one's breath away. For example, let us put aside the so-called eugenics problems and eugenics policies, population problems and birth incentive policies, which are related to children's problems. The issues that are directly related to children, such as the active education issue, the nutrition issue, etc., are all extremely ordinary and important, but in today's Shanghai, talking about them is still too extravagant. There are those that are valued by various countries, and their theoretical research and practical investigations and measures have all reached a high level, and are especially necessary for Shanghai society, such as the issue of juvenile delinquency; in Shanghai, one only sees Shanghai as a huge and unparalleled open-air school that teaches children to commit crimes.</p>
<p>All children's problems are adults' problems; the particularly serious children's problems in Shanghai are problems that the general Shanghai people should be particularly responsible for; under the current situation, we certainly do not expect or talk extravagantly about all the problems of Shanghai's children; how to urgently seek answers should be done, but every adult has the most opportunities to contact children, and this is only to hope that every adult will do their best for what they come into contact with. If it is said that the Shanghai of the future will be the Shanghai of modern Shanghai children, then modern Shanghai people must at least know that sitting idly by and entrusting the future of Shanghai to a criminal open-air school is not a good plan! Children are innocent, the guilt lies with adults.</p>

<h3>Summary of Resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee: Implement Economic Control to Ensure Victory in the War of Resistance and National Construction; Strengthen Unity Among Domestic Ethnic Groups and Religious Organizations</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The following is a summary of the important resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee:</p>
<p>(1) On the proposal to mobilize financial resources, expand production, and implement controlled economy to ensure victory in the War of Resistance and National Construction. Resolved and passed, to be earnestly implemented by the government. Key points of the proposal:</p>
<p>Reason: The war has now lasted four years, and future warfare should be primarily economic warfare. The goals are, firstly, to strive for final victory, and secondly, to seek permanent national defense security. Therefore, all wartime measures should not only be implemented during the war but must be extended to the post-war period until the goal of absolute national defense security is achieved. All economic measures should follow this principle, making fundamental plans and construction, and promoting the coordination of various departments and the simultaneous development of various undertakings. The foundation of economic warfare lies in the supply of materials. To ensure an adequate supply of materials, expanding production is essential. Expanding production requires abundant financial resources and stable prices as preconditions. China's resources are inherently abundant, and the problem is not the lack of resources but the failure to actively develop them; not the lack of production but the failure to rationally use financial and human resources; not the lack of supply but the government's failure to统筹掌握 control and manage it. Therefore, on the one hand, government revenue is insufficient, and construction funds are stretched, while on the other hand, there is an abundance of idle capital in society. Even the previously desolate rural areas now show signs of active capital. On the one hand, there is a sense of labor shortage, while on the other hand, there is a waste of manpower. Those who seek shortcuts, speculate, manipulate the market, and do not engage in legitimate work are everywhere. This contradictory situation is due to the redistribution of social wealth during the war, which is the evil result of rising prices. If allowed to develop, it will make government finances increasingly strained, social idle capital more abundant, wages increasingly higher, and manpower waste more significant. Once a vicious economic cycle is formed, how can production be expanded? The scarcity of materials will surely cause poverty, and runaway prices will have no end. Without decisive measures, it is not enough to talk about economic warfare and ensure the final victory. Under these circumstances, the government authorities, learning from past mistakes, must make a decision, take responsibility, and set policies to concentrate all political forces, transform the economic situation, and enrich its content and essence. Based on the current urgent needs, several measures are proposed for discussion and resolution.</p>
<p>Measures: (A) Mobilizing Financial Resources: (1) Expand the direct tax system and strictly collect excessive profits tax. (2) Consumption taxes should uniformly adopt an ad valorem taxation system. (3) Implement a national monopoly system on a trial basis. (4) Strengthen the solicitation of public bonds and issue in-kind treasury bills for land tax. (B) Expanding Production: (1) Expand loans for industry and mining. (2) Stipulate phased production increase measures and limit the minimum production amount. (3) Expand the scope of military insurance and reduce insurance costs. (4) Increase working hours and improve work efficiency. (5) Mobilize national technical experts and enforce compulsory service. (6) Restrict workers from changing occupations and utilize female workers. (C) Stabilizing Prices: (1) Actively facilitate transportation. (2) Strictly prohibit provinces from levying excessive transit taxes. (3) Enforce warehouse management. (4) Strictly inspect finance. (5) Publicly discuss prices. (6) Conserve living expenses.</p>
<p>(2) On the Essentials of Governance to Strengthen the Permanent Harmonious Unity Among Domestic Ethnic Groups and Religions to Achieve the Goals of Victory in War and Success in National Construction (Proposed by the Presidium). Resolved and passed.</p>
<p>Original Proposal: Since our Founding Father created the Republic of China, the fundamental principle of national construction has been that all people in the country, regardless of race, religion, or class, are equal. This is recorded in the law and upheld by the whole country. The First National Congress of our Party reiterated that externally, we seek national independence and freedom; internally, we seek equality for all ethnic groups. Now, when the whole country is united and working together to resist the war, it is even more appropriate to strengthen the unity among domestic ethnic groups and the harmony among religions to implement the Three Principles of the People. Now, the essential measures for previous Congresses were summarized and the administrative guidelines regarding border areas were compiled as follows. (A) Regarding General Principles: (1) All measures for ethnic minorities in border areas should cultivate their ability to self-govern, improve their lives, and support their culture to ensure the foundation of their autonomy. (2) All measures for ethnic minorities in border areas should prioritize the interests of the local indigenous people. (3) Respect the religious beliefs and good social customs of all ethnic groups, and coordinate the emotions of all ethnic groups to establish a unified national culture. (B) Regarding Politics: (1) Local governments in border and near-border provinces should focus on revitalizing education and improving people's lives. The budget for this should be gradually increased. (2) Local governments in all border areas and border administration agencies at all levels should adapt to environmental conditions and, as much as possible, employ local people of all ethnic groups. Those who are excellent should be specially selected to participate in the central party and government to gather ideas and benefit widely. (C) Regarding Economy: (1) Quickly open up major highways and railways in border areas. (2) Gradually increase the number of financial institutions, professions, and cooperative organizations in various border areas to support the development of economic undertakings. (3) The government should provide as much capital and technical assistance as possible for the original production undertakings of the people in border areas. (D) Regarding Education: (1) Improve and expand existing border education institutions to cultivate talent in border areas. (2) Set up necessary vocational schools of all levels at appropriate locations, and set up normal schools of all levels to train various talents in border areas to meet the needs of construction. (3) Establish special translation agencies for border area languages to compile and print books and school textbooks in various ethnic languages. (4) Establish border affairs research institutions, hire experts, collect data, and study and plan border area construction issues to contribute to the government for reference and to promote interest in border area construction.

They will also perform tomorrow. (3rd Dispatch, Havas Agency)</p>

<p>Capital of Yugoslavia: Diplomatic sources say that Foreign Minister Nincic of the South and another minister may go to Rome to accept Italian mediation of the German-South conflict.

Due to the unstable situation in the Southern countries, Italy has had to redeploy troops to prevent new threats on the Abyssinian front. (3rd Dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia: A senior official said, "The previous cabinet signed a protocol to join the German-Italian-Japanese alliance, which we are prepared to respect. Our country should maintain neutrality towards Germany and hope to be more friendly. We are prepared to supply Germany with various foods and are willing to allow Germany to use the national railways to transport goods to the Soviet Union and Bulgaria. But other than that, we cannot add anything more. How the future situation will develop depends on how the German authorities plan to shift.

He studied law, sociology, and geography at the University of Budapest and traveled throughout Europe. In 1905, he was elected as a member of parliament. He was drafted into the army during the First World War and served as an officer. In 1920, he served as the Cabinet Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, and soon retired. He did not return until 1938 and has remained in office to this day. When Czechoslovakia was divided in October 1938, Hungary obtained southeastern Slovakia and part of Carpathian, with an area of 4,665 square miles and a population of 1,027,450. Last August, it merged half of Outer Silvania province in Romania, with an area of 19,300 square miles and a population of 2,370,000. The accession of Hungary to the Axis a few weeks ago was presided over by him. (3rd Dispatch, Havas)</p>

The parliament has also announced its adjournment. Government officials and envoys from various countries have expressed their condolences to the Teleki family. (3rd Dispatch, Havas)</p>
<h3>European War Anecdotes (43): Inside Germany During the War</h3>
<p>Hitler owns the most exquisitely constructed air raid shelter in Berlin. According to experts, he would never be bombed to death there under any circumstances. This air raid shelter is very deep underground, constructed entirely of reinforced steel and concrete, and equipped with automatic ventilators and generators, a private movie screening room, and a surgical operating room for medical use. Even if British bombs leveled the Chancellery to the ground, and all the routes from the underground shelter to the outside were seemingly cut off, Hitler and his aides could still escape from the air raid shelter through an underground passage, run several hundred yards away, and safely ascend to the surface from underground. Hitler's air raid shelter is equipped with spacious bedrooms, which is a crucial design (it's a pity they didn't pay attention to this in other air raid shelters), because the losses suffered by Germans from insomnia are greater than those from the bombing by the British air force.</p>
<p>During a period last autumn, several minor European politicians gathered in Berlin, some to receive final instructions, others to "pick up some scraps," hoping to get some benefits from Hitler's leftovers. Some of them, when returning to their respective capitals, were convinced that Berlin would never be bombed (Goering boasted of this), which was actually deceptive. Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer, General Franco's brother-in-law, a humble and approachable man, was on a grand tour of Berlin at this time, and when he returned to his country, he almost took such a report with him. In the end, he didn't do so, which was due to the correspondents of American newspapers.</p>
<p>The reason was that American journalists sitting in the Adlon Hotel saw that Mr. Suñer was about to return to Madrid and would inevitably tell Franco that in his ten long nights in Berlin, not a single British aircraft had ever been detected over the capital, the British were simply finished, and now was the best opportunity for Spain to join the Axis camp. Some journalists had already hinted at this meaning in their telegrams as much as they could. Finally, on the night before Suñer left Berlin, the British Air Force visited Berlin. Goebbels and several high-ranking Nazi Party officials were hosting a banquet for the Spanish dignitary at the Adlon Hotel that evening. Before the dessert was served, the grand feast ended hastily, and all the guests and attendants rushed to the spacious underground shelter of the Adlon Hotel next to the barber shop, hiding there until they "emerged" from the ground at about four o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p>Italian Foreign Minister Ciano also spent a night in the underground shelter next to the barber shop. Afterwards, British aircraft paid special attention to the diplomatic comings and goings in Berlin, although they didn't necessarily choose an auspicious day. On the night Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov arrived in Berlin, many people thought that British aircraft would definitely not let go of this opportunity. That night, Ribbentrop treated him as a state guest, with a grand banquet. Almost all the leaders of the Nazi Party, except Hitler, and senior officers of the army, navy, and air force were present. I still remember the unease of some officials in the Chancellery that evening. They were deeply afraid that such a solemn banquet, if it had to be moved to the underground shelter under the threat of bombs, wouldn't it become a great laughing stock? That night, British aircraft did not appear. The next night, when German officials attended a banquet at the Soviet Embassy, they came in force without any courtesy. Goering had previously ordered his subordinates that as soon as they received a report of British aircraft flying into German territory, they must immediately notify the Berlin authorities so that all the guests could slip away half an hour early before the air raid alarm was issued in the city. According to those present, Molotov was unwilling to step into the underground shelter when the air raid occurred, but looked up at the fireworks and shooting stars in the sky from a dark window. That night, British aircraft carefully did not drop bombs in the city center, so no major mishaps occurred.</p>
<p>The damage Berlin suffered from British air raids was relatively small. Tourists who came to Berlin for the first time could wander in the commercial and residential areas for several hours without seeing a bombed-out house. The number of bombed houses was probably less than five hundred, and most of the attacked houses were repaired within a month, and the residents moved back in. The places bombed by British aircraft were mostly factories in the suburbs. The Siemens electrical factory in the northwest suburb of Berlin, and the areas where the Heinkel and Henschel aircraft factories were located, were the most important bombing targets in the Berlin area, and the British Air Force had repeatedly determined to bomb them to their satisfaction. On several nights, they were indeed bombed, with a machine workshop here and a storage area there damaged. But what is questionable is that on the day of the bombing, the reduction in the quantity of military equipment produced in these factories was probably less than five percent of the total. Recently, I drove through the area and heard the large machines in the factories running as usual, and from the outside, there was no sign of damage. Since the British concentrated their bombing on the Krupp artillery factory in Essen since mid-November last winter, I have not been there myself. But an American journalist I deeply trust had gone to observe afterwards, and he expressed surprise at the small amount of air raid damage there.</p>
<p>This matter is truly puzzling to observers in Germany, because a large smelting furnace of the Krupp artillery factory is built in the open air. In theory, it should be easily spotted by airmen at night.</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge, British aircraft have never carried out a terrible bombing of residential or commercial areas in Berlin. It is true that British aircraft have affected nearby cemeteries and even hospitals because they could not hit the railroads or stations. Although the large harbor and shipyards of Hamburg were bombed, it was not very severe. When I visited the area last autumn, I deeply felt that the heart of this second German city was virtually undamaged. The city center that was most severely bombed was probably Munich. Most of the destruction was caused in one night on the evening of November 8. Hitler was giving a speech in the Löwenbräukeller beer cellar in commemoration of the 1923 putsch that night, and as soon as he finished speaking, a major bombing occurred. However, on this occasion, the British Air Force did not look for the beer hall, but only dropped bombs on the central train station and the electrical vehicle control yard, etc. Several houses in the vicinity also suffered as collateral damage.</p>

<h3>Matsuoka Pays Homage to the Pope, Discusses World Politics, Finishes Talks with Italian Authorities, Returns to Berlin to Continue Discussions with Germany</h3>
<p>Vatican City – Reliable sources claim that Pope Pius XII and Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka yesterday discussed the relationship between the Soviet Union, Japan, and China, issues of Vatican missionary work, and peace procedures before the Axis spring offensive. It is understood that Matsuoka expressed regret over the Holy See's policy of supporting General Chiang Kai-shek, stating that Japan's policy mainly opposes the Communist Party and therefore does not oppose the Vatican's principles of attacking atheism. Reliable sources believe that Matsuoka suggested the Holy See withdraw its aid to China, as such aid benefits the Soviet Union's position in China, and communism inherently includes atheists. He further emphasized that Japan's interest is not religion, and therefore Japan will always allow Catholicism to preach in the occupied areas of China. The Pope received Matsuoka in his private chamber for approximately sixty-five minutes of talks in Italian. Vatican authoritative circles said that after Pope Pius XII met with Matsuoka, he remarked, "I am extremely pleased; Mr. Matsuoka is a great politician." It is rumored that during the secret talks, the Pope expressed his pleasure at Matsuoka's recent statement that Japan has always believed in peace. The Pope then presented the key points of peace and hoped that peace would be possible before the spring offensive. It is rumored that Matsuoka reiterated Japan's intention for peace and emphasized the importance of Japan's military obligations in the Tripartite Pact. The Japanese Foreign Minister expressed his willingness to cooperate in any efforts to prevent the European war from extending to the United States and Yugoslavia. After paying homage to the Pope, Matsuoka met with Prime Minister Mussolini and had lunch together. The Japanese Ambassador to Rome, Horiguchi, the German Ambassador to Italy, and representatives from the Italian government, military, and Fascist Party also attended the banquet. Horiguchi also hosted a dinner that evening to welcome Matsuoka, it is said. (United Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>Rome – Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka gave a speech to German, Italian, and Japanese journalists at Villa Madama yesterday, guaranteeing that the people of the three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan will always cooperate loyally. He stated that Italy and Japan should fight side by side to the end until their goals are achieved. The alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan is an alliance of a special nature, emphasizing the common interests of the three countries, while the individual interests of each country are secondary. The three countries share weal and woe, so this alliance will inevitably last for thousands of years. Matsuoka continued, saying that his conversations with Italy were sincere and inspiring. He was deeply impressed by his talks with the Italian Prime Minister. He also exchanged views with Foreign Minister Ciano. Matsuoka added that his visit to the Pope in Rome would be one of the most memorable events of his life. He was pleased to have spoken with the Pope and the Secretary of State of the Vatican and felt the trip was worthwhile. Matsuoka ended by saying that he would like to travel in Germany and Italy and would stay in Berlin for a few more days, but only on a non-official basis. He deeply hoped to visit the Western battlefield but had to pack his bags and return home early due to his duties. He might stay in Moscow for one day en route to make contact with key officials of the Soviet Union, but it would also be on a personal basis, it is said. (Haitong News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>London – Diplomatic circles here said yesterday that Matsuoka had been summoned to return to Tokyo and was avoiding further restrictions from the Axis powers. It is rumored that Matsuoka had full authority to unite Japan with the Axis militarily, but because of the coup in Yugoslavia, the British's great victory in East Africa in the Mediterranean, and the United States' sudden hardening of its attitude by seizing Axis ships, the Japanese government changed its mind at the last minute. It is rumored that Matsuoka will return to Tokyo before the end of this month, and his long-planned trip to the capitals of European Axis countries has been cancelled. (International News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>Berlin – German foreign affairs officials said yesterday that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka may return to Berlin from Rome to continue discussions with authorities, it is said. (Haitong News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>Rome – Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka, after a sixty-three-hour visit to Rome, took a train at 10:00 this morning to Berlin for his return journey to Japan. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and the Yugoslav Ambassador, Chiritich, saw him off at St. Paul's Station. When Matsuoka departed, thousands of Romans lined the streets in the heavy rain to see him off. From Villa Madama to the station, the streets were crowded with people. They waved the flags of Germany, Italy, and Japan and cheered as Matsuoka and Ciano passed by in the same car. According to Matsuoka's statement in the press yesterday, he will stay in Berlin for one day after returning before heading to Moscow. He will also stay in Moscow for several days. Before his departure, Matsuoka told the press that he regretted that the time was too short to visit the current war battlefields. (United Press, 3rd)</p>
<h3>American Newspapers Comment on Ogura's Cabinet Appointment</h3>
<p>Washington – Prime Minister Konoe's invitation to Masatsune Ogura, a major entrepreneur and director of the Sumitomo Company, to join the cabinet has aroused considerable interest here. Those familiar with Far Eastern affairs are now making various speculations, believing that this appointment may indicate the serious situation of the Japanese economy due to prolonged warfare with little success. Some also say that the Japanese military, which dominates policy, now realizes that the handling of war and the national economy cannot be solely undertaken by the military, so Ogura's policies after taking office will be closely watched. The Washington Star commented on the matter, calling Konoe an alert opportunist, and that his recruitment of Ogura into the cabinet shows that he has not yet subjected Japan to final restrictions in all aspects. The coup in Yugoslavia, the defeat of the Italian army, and the strong attitude of the United States, which has seized Axis ships, have certainly increased Konoe's caution, it is said. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Masatsune Ogura, director of the Sumitomo Company, was sworn in yesterday as a minister without portfolio. It is generally expected that Ogura's business experience will help the government establish closer ties with the economic and industrial sectors, it is said. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Secretary of State Hull Rejects Second Axis Protest, U.S. Determined Not to Release Detained Vessels, Mexico Follows U.S. Lead with Same Action</h3>
<p>Washington – It is rumored that Secretary of State Hull has decided to reject Germany and Italy's request to release the seized vessels. When reporters asked Hull if the authorities currently intended to release their vessels as requested by the Axis countries, he replied that he had not heard of any such intention on the part of the government. When the United States replies to the German and Italian protest notes, the State Department may propose to the German and Italian embassies the issue of publishing the correspondence, it is said. It is rumored that Germany has now sent a second protest note to the United States regarding the seizure of ships. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Washington – Yesterday, the U.S. State Department announced that it had received two protest notes from Germany and Italy regarding the U.S. seizure of their ships and the detention of sailors. It was also reported that the German Embassy in the U.S. had disclosed the contents of the protest notes. In addition to demanding the immediate release of the confiscated ships, it strongly criticized the poor treatment of the detained sailors and demanded the immediate restoration of their freedom. (Haitong News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>Mexico City – According to information obtained last night, before Mexico confiscated German and Italian ships, Mexican Foreign Minister Padilla received a note from U.S. Ambassador Daniels stating that the U.S. would soon confiscate Axis ships and hoped Mexico would take the same action. Mexico has now confiscated one German ship of 9,400 tons and another of 4,000 tons. A total of nine Italian ships have been confiscated, including two freighters, several cargo ships, and the rest passenger ships, with tonnages ranging from 5,400 to 7,800 tons.

<p>Chilean Capital – The Chilean government or naval authorities have no plans to take any measures against German and Italian merchant ships anchored in Chilean ports. Chilean police in all ports are still protecting them as usual yesterday, it is said. (Haitong News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>Colombian Capital – A spokesman for the Colombian Foreign Ministry announced yesterday that the Colombian government did not intend to confiscate any foreign ships. After studying the current situation, Colombia decided to do its best to protect foreign ships and did not intend to take the same measures as other countries in the Americas. Currently, there are two Italian ships in the Colombian port of Cartagena. Germany previously had a ship, the "Helgoland," anchored in a Colombian port, but it sailed back to Germany last year, it is said. (Haitong News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>Danish Capital – The Danish Foreign Ministry issued an official statement last night regarding the confiscation of Danish ships by South American countries. The original text is as follows: "After the Chilean government confiscated three ships of the Danish Lauritzen shipping company, the Danish Minister to Argentina and Chile, Sang, flew to the Chilean capital to protest to the Chilean Foreign Ministry and demand that the detained ships be returned to the Danish shipping company, it is said.

<h3>American Labor Unrest Surges, Large-Scale Bloody Incident Occurs, Thirty Injured at Ford Factory, Four Miners Killed in Harlan</h3>
<p>Dearborn, Michigan – The world's largest industrial organization has become the focus of American labor disputes. Workers inside provoked the supervisors, leading to a fight. The Governor of Michigan has ordered all police to the factory to suppress the unrest, and Police Chief Block has dispatched an additional 250 officers to assist the 130 police officers already sent. Federal mediator Dewey flew here yesterday, attempting to get the union and the factory to reach a peace agreement. Strike leader Wichman telegraphed Nathan, the production management supervisor, and Hillman, the labor representative of the National Defense Committee, requesting that they send personnel to escort workers through the strike supervisors to enter the factory in order to maintain national defense work. According to the union, there are as many as 95,000 strikers. All factory gates are blocked by cars, with as many as fifteen cars arranged in a line to block each gate. The union said that the strike was caused by demands for increased wages, recognition of the union, and reinstatement of dismissed workers. It is rumored that a man named Caruso is in critical condition due to his injuries. Bernard, the factory's personnel director, said that Ford has stated twice that the eight Industrial Organizations Committee members whose dismissal sparked the strike will never be allowed to work at the Ford Motor Company again. Bernard also said that the company has proven that the leaders of the Industrial Organizations Committee are communists, and these party members hope to bring national industrial life to a complete standstill in order to create a revolutionary situation and realize the dictatorship of the proletariat. But Bernard added that all the members of the Industrial Organizations Congress are patriotic, it is said. (United Press, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Food: Foreign Rice Pours In, Market Prices Slightly Weaker</h3>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taigu Company's Taiyuan Wheel arrived yesterday morning from Hong Kong with 7,201 bags of foreign rice and 1,000 bags of corn, berthing at the company's wharf in the French Concession for unloading. Also, the Zhejiang Wheel also arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carrying 2,766 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, berthing at the company's wharf in Pudong for unloading. Yongzhen Wheel, managed by Xia Laochen Foreign Firm, was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday from Yangon, Myanmar, but had not yet entered the port as of late at night. According to the company, due to special circumstances, the ship is traveling slower and should arrive one or two days later. The exact date cannot be specified because the ship has not reported it. (祖)</p>
<p>The inventory of foreign rice is gradually increasing, and the supply is endless. It is difficult for general speculators to rely on Japanese yen loans and false fixed orders and ships to raise prices, and the excess of supply over demand is enough to prove that the market price is not easy to rise. Therefore, new customers are watching and not advancing, and profit-taking bulls are eager to close out. The opening market has a strong selling atmosphere, and the market is unable to support it and is falling. The small Jiao Yinghua Si original package opened at 129 yuan, but yesterday it had already fallen to 115 or 6 yuan, and the road goods were only 124 yuan, both 3 to 4 yuan lower than the previous market. The afternoon business was even more sluggish, and the market price was called down by nearly one yuan, but there were no buyers. Although spot transactions were active, under the competition of many sellers, the high-end prices were gradually declining. No. 1 Siam opened at 110 yuan, settling at 108.8 yuan to 108 yuan. Also, No. 2 was from 107 yuan to 105.5 yuan, 火絞 (Huojiao) at 107 yuan, and 小絞 (Xiaojiao) at 104.5 yuan. These were all 2 to 3 yuan lower than the previous market. The afternoon was weak and lacking in transactions, and the after-market may have to weaken again. The total transaction volume for the day was 10,000 bags of spot rice and 400 to 500 tons of original packages. Observing the above prices, the difference in quality is negligible, that is, taking No. 1 Siam and 小絞 (Xiaojiao) as examples, the distance is only about 2 yuan, which is truly unimaginable.</p>
<p>Due to the recent repeated downstream prices of thick and thin粳 (Jing) and other domestic rice, transporters have suffered losses and have mostly stopped. The owners, in order to protect themselves, are unwilling to lightly sell, and hold on with all their might. Therefore, although local stores are not selling well, the market has not changed and is in a stable situation. The prices quoted are all similar to before, with little rise or fall.</p>
<p>糯 (Nuo) rice is constrained by foreign rice and finds it difficult to stand firm, depreciating by one or two yuan. Hong Kong special yuan opened at 140 yuan, settling at 100 yuan. 糯茶 (Nuocha) high opened at 96 or 7 yuan, settling to broken rice at 90 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Flour Market Has Very Little Fluctuation</h3>
<p>Flour: The current spot market for foreign flour is dull due to the flat sales of customer gangs for several days. Since the local street has a daily supply of flat-priced flour, the demand is even more sluggish. Moreover, the miscellaneous grains market has been calm recently, and speculative groups are all in a wait-and-see state. Therefore, flour prices fluctuate very little. Hua Wu and Zhonglou brand Australian flour opened at 29.12 yuan to 29 yuan. Jinlong brand Kan flour ended up with both inventories and deliveries, rising and falling quickly, priced at 28.8 yuan back to 28.65 yuan, with less than 10,000 bags traded. The market is still brewing.</p>
<p>Wheat: The market was as sluggish as usual yesterday. There is currently a long-term lack of spot goods, generally said to be a market with no goods. Except for the occasional sporadic arrivals from nearby from Japanese factories, and retail purchases, there are no whole transactions. The selling price is still 45 or 6 yuan, also in the brewing stage.</p>
<p>Beans: Arrived in Shanghai, with 1,350 bags shipped from Qingdao yesterday.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Short Selling Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>Foreign exchange: The market condition yesterday, HSBC's listing remained flat. In the dark market for British and American exchanges, the potential was slightly relaxed. At around 10 o'clock, the market suddenly rumored that the Emperor of Japan had recalled Matsuoka, and the speculators' intention to sell suddenly emerged, squeezing out about 7 to 800,000 US dollars of May-term US exchange, resulting in a settlement of 5.3125 yuan for the May-term US exchange at one point. However, HSBC's profits and other external firms were healthy, and Chinese firms were also absorbing, so as a result, although the spot and this month were slightly loose, the May-term futures were flat. The closing price for spot and this month was 3 and 25 cents and 5.3125 yuan, and the May-term was 3 and 234375 cents and 5.28125 yuan.</p>
<p>Speculation Pushes Out Term US Exchange</p>
<p>In the early morning, due to the flat London big strips, and the stable dollar price and London raw surplus, various exchanges such as British and American exchanges were unchanged. The central listing of various exchanges was as before. The banks opened the spot selling price in the morning, British gold 3 and 234375 cents, US exchange 5.28125 yuan, both flat compared to the previous close. After opening, foreign firms did a little bit of business, and the market was dull and flat. It is estimated that Maijiali sold 4-month US exchange at 5.28125 yuan to HSBC. HSBC's listing was unchanged. The silver balance tax was also flat. After that, Japanese banks吐出 (tutoo, unsure of the exact meaning here), and profits were also sold, but foreign banks, including HSBC, still had absorption, and Chinese banks frequently came to absorb, so the term market situation was still stable. It is estimated that HSBC absorbed spot US exchange from Japanese banks and British banks' profits at 5.3125 yuan, amounting to more than 200,000 dollars. Later, a sudden negative rumor arose, and speculators forcefully squeezed 4- and 5-month term US exchange for 500,000 yuan. At that time, HSBC's absorption turned dull, and the market situation relaxed accordingly. It is estimated that 4-month US exchange was sold to Chinese banks at 5.3125 yuan, and 4-month US exchange was sold to foreign banks at 5.34375 yuan, and 5-month US exchange was sold at 5.3125 yuan. As a result, the closing price for British gold was 3 and 25 cents, and US exchange was 5.3125 yuan.</p>
<p>The Market Situation Relaxed Accordingly</p>
<p>In the aftermarket, speculators continued to short sell, and foreign merchants grabbed customers and also squeezed. However, HSBC and other's absorption recovered well, and the term futures market actually tightened. It is estimated that 5-month US exchange was opened at 5.3125 yuan. At that time, to close the 進 (jin) position, it already required 5.28125 yuan. Later, trading gradually decreased, and the situation was flat. As a result, the closing price was British gold 3 and 25 cents, US exchange 5.3125 yuan, 5-month British gold 3 and 234375 cents, and 5-month US exchange 5.28125 yuan, compared to the previous day's spot and April, British long 015625, US hard 03125, and 5-month were not distinguished in glory or disgrace.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Shen Exchange Drops Uniquely</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 3rd (Thursday) Electric: The exchange market opened flat this morning, and various exchanges were unchanged. At 11:30, it was reported as flat, and the spot Shen exchange dropped uniquely by one yuan, to 463 yuan. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<p>Tianjin British and American Shrink Together</p>
<p>Tianjin, 3rd (Thursday) Electric: The exchange market opened flat this morning, London Telegraphic Transfer, 03125, to 3 便士 (pennies) 34375 (the telegraphic code may be incorrect, pending verification), New York Telegraphic Transfer also shrank 03125, to 5 and a half yuan, Shen exchange rose by 9 cents, to 95.75 yuan, and the "Joint Notes" dark plate rose by 25 cents, to 63.75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Sentiment Unsettled, Price Reverses from Rise to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai gold market, after a period of subdued trading, saw a slight change. Initially, the price rose, but then suddenly and sharply fell, once dropping to the vicinity of 6,500 yuan. Eventually, it recovered slightly. The upward sentiment that prevailed among various parties was dashed by rumors seen as detrimental. It was widely rumored that the Japanese Emperor had recalled Matsuoka, the foreign minister active in Germany and Italy, triggering nervous rumors that Japan was withdrawing from the Axis powers and hastily returning home to embrace the Anglo-American camp. As a result, the U.S. dollar exchange rate relaxed, and the central gold price eased. The price, initially supported by securities firms, reached 6,586 yuan before gradually falling to 6,505 yuan, after gold shops resumed selling. Eventually, as the rumors were deemed too far-fetched, news of a slight softening in the U.S. dollar exchange rate and buying activity in Shanghai's western districts led the price to recover to around 6,540 yuan. The closing price was down 31 yuan. The total daily trading volume was approximately 15,000 to 16,000 taels. Cash transactions were increasingly prevalent. First, Shihe sold 100 taels to Xianghe, with the price 150 yuan higher than the futures price. Wanfeng sold 50 taels to Xianghe, 155 yuan higher. Later, Yongcheng sold 70 taels to Decheng, Chengji sold 50 taels to Xianghe, and Wanfeng sold 100 taels to Xiangxingyong, while Litai sold a total of 270 taels to Xiangxingyong and Xianghe, all at 160 yuan higher. In the afternoon, Defu purchased 100 taels from Yifeng, 170 yuan higher. Finally, there were buyers at 180 yuan higher. This was for settling previous positions. Jewelry gold initially fell and then recovered to flat, remaining at 690 yuan. Customs gold and other gold prices were flat. The swap date for this month (April turning into May), the 10th, coincides with the Tomb Sweeping Festival holiday (four days of holiday including Sunday, from the 11th to the 14th), so it will be held in advance from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM on the 10th.</p>
<p>Shanghai Gold Plunge Nears Noon</p>
<p>In the early morning, the opening price for each bar (ten taels) was 6,565 yuan, one yuan higher than the previous day's high. Subsequently, buying interest intensified, with Defu, Yifeng, Tongkangyong, Dafeng, and others actively bidding up the price. It soon reached 6,586 yuan. However, Xin Fengyong, a foreign exchange firm, frequently sold, and Chengji, Hengji, and Decheng also sold, causing the price to fall slightly to 6,570 yuan. At that time, Decheng reversed to buy, and Xiangxingyong also came in to buy. The market situation was once stable. Around 10:30 AM, selling pressure suddenly emerged, with Renchengyong, Hesheng, and Xianghe selling heavily. Coupled with a strengthening of the foreign exchange market and rumors of negative news, the price fell to 6,532 yuan. Later, Xianghe and Daji reversed to buy, pulling the price up by 15 yuan. However, with sentiment weak and selling pressure re-emerging, Tongkangyong, Defu, and Chengji sold heavily, pushing the price down again to 6,505 yuan. At noon, Gonghe and Hengji still had buying interest, but by the close, the price had recovered to 6,522 yuan. The afternoon opening was down 12 yuan, at 6,510 yuan. However, after the opening, major players came in to buy. Although Chengji and Hengji sold, the market gradually rose, soon recovering 28 yuan, reaching the 6,530 yuan level. At this time, the foreign exchange futures market softened slightly, so Dafeng and Deda bought to cover short positions, continuing the recovery to 6,542 yuan. In the evening, Hengji continued to sell, and the number of buyers decreased. The closing price was 6,532 yuan, resulting in a decrease of 21 yuan compared to the previous day. Based on the closing price of the U.S. dollar at 5.3125 yuan in April, the closing price was 6,555.3 yuan, a decrease of 23.3 yuan. After the market closed, the price rose to 6,538 yuan. The daily fluctuation was 81 yuan. The selling price of cash gold from major gold shops was 200 yuan higher than the Shanghai gold futures price, and the buying price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for spot gold.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Initially Falls Slightly, Then Rises Significantly</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at Datongxing and Xintongxing was lowered by 10 yuan at 11:00 AM, to 680 yuan. At 3:00 PM, it increased by 10 yuan, leveling at 690 yuan. The buying price was reduced by 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Decline Not Significant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign currency market, after rising, the Shanghai gold market price turned downward, and British and American gold pounds each fell by one yuan. British gold bills remained stable, and the market price was flat. U.S. dollar bills initially rose to 18.70 yuan, then gradually declined to 18.051 yuan. In the afternoon, they rose again to 18.54 yuan, still down 0.12 yuan from the previous day. Hong Kong dollar bills rose and then returned to flat. Japanese gold bills showed a slight upward trend, rising to 1.98 yuan in the evening session. Korean dollar bills had balanced supply and demand, and the market price was flat, remaining at 1.64 yuan in the evening session.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bond Market Strengthens</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter market for public bonds strengthened yesterday, and the positions of buyers and sellers also changed. Tongkang's buying interest was strong, and Xinfu's buying interest was also not weak, changing the market trend. The short positions of general retail investors and those who follow the trend gradually wavered. As for the rumor that Japan was withdrawing from the Axis powers, it was still far from being confirmed and had no immediate impact on the market price. The positive outlook for the market price was solely due to the fact that buyers were only buying and not selling. Yesterday's trading saw Tongkang, Jiafu, Defu, and Jiucheng buying in the morning, while Yu Xingzhong sold significant amounts of categories A, B, and C, reducing the market price slightly. Midway through the session, Tongkang's buying interest was very strong, and the buying side gradually gained the upper hand, raising the price by 0.2-0.3 yuan. The closing price at noon was higher than the previous day. In the afternoon, Tongkang and Xinfu continued their strong buying interest, and a certain financial figure representing Shengda also bought very strongly. Qianyi also showed interest in buying. Yuxing sold another 200,000 to 300,000 yuan of category E. Renfeng and Yitai Zhongyi both sold. As a result, the price continued to rise by 0.051 yuan to 0.25 yuan. The total transaction volume was 1.5-1.6 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Transactions: 100 shares of China National Underwear Company were traded at a price of 10.025 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, the 50 shares of Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory that were traded the day before at a price of 22.25 yuan were mistakenly reported as 20.025 yuan. This is now corrected.</p>
<p>London, 2nd (Wednesday) Dispatch: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds and Far Eastern British companies' stocks remained flat. Only bank stocks showed some improvement, continuing to rise. Mercantile Bank shares continued to rise by 1 shilling and 3 pence, to £8 16s 3d. Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation shares each rose by £1, with shares registered in London at £76 and shares registered in Hong Kong at £77. There were prices but no market. There were no other changes.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cotton Flower Market Are Only Used for Speculation; Actual Sales Are Seized, All Replaced by Miscellaneous Brands</h3>
<p>The yarn market remains weak, and the trend is still hovering. This is because sales have not fully developed. Although Hong Kong merchants are interested in buying, they still specify a few brands: 23 strands of Golden Rooster, Dafat 20 strands, Special Jincheng, Shepherd, and the remaining 32 strands of single yarn. They purchase only a few bales each day, and do not ask about anything else. Therefore, the single yarns of the Shuangma factory are all traded like a football being kicked around. When the chips on the market are loose, the price will fall; when they are tight, the price will rise. The public is holding a wait-and-see attitude, waiting for a change to come before deciding the outcome. The overall situation is still depressing. The high price for 20 strands of Shuangma was 1,401 yuan, and the low price was 1,386 yuan. The opening price in the early afternoon was 1,390.5 yuan, rising to 1,394.5 yuan. The final price was 1,393 yuan. The over-the-counter situation in the afternoon was that there were many shouting prices, but few transactions.</p>
<p>Shuangma: The opening was slightly stable, with the opening price at 1,393 yuan. After that, buying was strong, and the situation became more active. Some people said that if buyers of the Shenxin Factory failed to clear their purchases after April 15th, they would have to pay an additional 15 yuan in warehouse rent per piece. After many parties requested the factory to reduce the warehouse rent or proceed with negotiations, the sentiment of the buying parties was boosted, and the market once rose to 1,401 yuan. However, the bid price was mediocre, and the foreign exchange market was quiet and saw a slight decrease, returning to 1,393.5 yuan. By the close, rumors suddenly arose in the market that the bid price had plummeted, and selling pressure increased, falling to 1,386 yuan. The closing price recovered to 1,389 yuan. The half-day transaction statistics totaled 5,515 bales. The amount purchased by each merchant group is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 460; Fuzhou: 15; Nanyang: 30</p>
<p>Colleagues: 5,000; Total: 5,515</p>
<h3>Factory Demand Increases Daily; Cotton Market Active</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is slightly weaker, but the price of 42 strands of raw materials is still high due to the strength of American cotton. Factories are also interested in buying, but not as aggressively as cotton firms. As for foreign factories, most ship directly, leaving no room for cotton merchants to intervene, so they cannot be very enthusiastic. However, industry colleagues uniformly hope for higher prices. As a result, the long-stagnant cotton market has shown a glimmer of hope. Today, affected by the weakness of the yarn market, the market price fell slightly by 1-2 yuan, but sentiment and transactions were very active. The total number of transactions between factories and cotton firms throughout the day was 4,686 pieces. The transactions for each type of cotton are recorded below:</p>
<p>Dazhongjimujia: 290.0; Xinyu: 200 pieces</p>
<p>Dazhongjijiebao: 287.0; Xinyu: 300 pieces</p>
<p>Meipengjiapo: 305.0; Shanghai: 500 pieces</p>
<p>Meijiapo: 300.0; Donghua: 300 pieces</p>
<p>Meizhongjiebao: 280.0; Shenxin: 221 pieces</p>
<p>Mitelin: 371.0; Shenxin: 80 pieces</p>
<p>Mitelin: 22.0; Shenxin: 200 pieces</p>
<p>Xinte: 188.25; Shenxin: 225 pieces</p>
<p>Bailuoqu: 245.0; Haojia: 200 pieces</p>
<p>Bailuoqu: 245.0; Qingsheng: 100 pieces</p>
<p>Bailuoqu: 246.5; Haojia: 200 pieces</p>
<p>Miteling: 369.0; Quchang: 200 pieces</p>
<p>Temiteling: 374.0; Tongchang: 100 pieces</p>
<p>Meipengjiapo: 295.0; Colleagues: 200 pieces</p>
<p>Meipengjiapo: 200.0; Colleagues: 300 pieces</p>
<p>Meipengjiapo: 296.0; Qingsheng: 100 pieces</p>
<p>Meipengjiapo: 292.5; Shenghe: 200 pieces</p>
<p>Dazhongjimujia: 290.0; Colleagues: 200 pieces</p>
<p>Dazhongjijiebao: 287.0; Colleagues: 300 pieces</p>
<p>Dazhongjimujia: 295.0; Colleagues: 105 pieces</p>
<p>Brazil: 381.5; Wanchang: 114 pieces</p>
<p>Xirongcaobao: 263.0; Kaitai: 150 pieces</p>
<p>NT: 310.0; Colleagues: 200 pieces</p>
<p>According to another report, foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai were more active than the previous day, and yarn factories also showed some improvement in inventory. There have been many transactions in recent days, and the buying sentiment among colleagues is still strong. The market situation is also trending towards being firmer, with an increase of 2-3 yuan.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market was quiet and firm in the early morning, but suddenly rallied later due to large-scale buying and news from Washington that American cotton would receive 75% loan support. As a result, the closing price rose by 6-10 points.</p>
<p>Indian cotton was quite flat, initially falling due to the sale of cotton contracts and profit-taking by long positions, but then recovering due to buyer support. Yesterday's closing price for Bailuoqu fell by 5 rupees, while the rest fell by 2-4 rupees. It is predicted that the opening price today will rise slightly by 1.5 rupees.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Factory Plates Are Very Tight</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market trend was firm and rising, and transactions were frequent. This was because the plates of each cloth factory were very tight. The current market for fine cloth twill from local factories is still cheaper than Dong Pi. Demand from dyeing factories is gradually increasing. Distant customers such as Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants continue to purchase dark-colored cotton cloth. The selling price of fine cloth twill has increased by 0.25 yuan. Light-weight coarse cloth and colored cloth have increased by 0.25-0.5 yuan. Over 600 pieces of gray cloth and bleached cloth were traded in Muji Street. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants purchased over 300 pieces of blue cloth, serge, and flannel. Purchases by Zhejiang and Fujian merchants were relatively sparse. Over 4,000 pieces of colored cloth and bleached cloth were purchased by foreign countries such as Singapore and Siam.</p>
<p>Heavy Leather Takes Off, Sales Have Started</p>
<p>The heavy leather market yesterday was quite firm and rising. Whether it was plain, striped, checkered, or dotted, the trend was unusually brisk. This was because inventory was lacking, and heavy leather is completely woven from raw hair and is considered valuable only if it has elasticity. Therefore, no goods from local factories have been woven and released, making the market goods even scarcer. In terms of sales, it is essential for the summer season, so clothing stores for major customers must have it in stock. In recent days, actual sales have been increasing in the market, and customers have been inquiring and placing orders one after another. Tailors of Western clothing have all been buying. Yesterday, 14,000 pieces of plain and striped heavy leather from Futai were sold at a wholesale price of 26.5 yuan per yard. It is said that a total of over 500 yards were sold.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Large Quantities of Coarse White Sugar Released</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight decline because Taikoo released a large quantity of coarse white sugar, causing sentiment to soften. Taikoo released thousands of bags of June shipment of Dutch coarse white sugar, with the price at USD 3.60, according to the C.I.F. standard. It also released 8,000 bags of B-mark military white sugar at HKD 14.20, 8,000 bags of DY-mark at HKD 13.90, and 4,000 bags of HX-mark at HKD 13.80. The guild's quoted prices for spot No. 24 coarse white sugar were 89.5 yuan for the local warehouse, 89 yuan for the foreign warehouse, 88.5 yuan, 88 yuan, and 88.3 yuan. The futures price for the 10th of the current month was 89.5 yuan, 89 yuan, 88.8 yuan, 88.5 yuan, 88.3 yuan, and 88.7 yuan, all slightly lower than Yuan Xu. The futures price for the 20th of the current month was 90.07 yuan, 90 yuan, 89.5 yuan, 85 yuan, 89.5 yuan, 89.7 yuan, slightly lower than 0.9 yuan. The Dutch red sugar initially tightened and then softened, reaching 69.5 yuan, then falling to 69 yuan and 68.8 yuan, without any changes. The price of Taikoo's coarse white sugar B-mark in the West warehouse was 89.5 yuan, slightly lower than 1 yuan. The price of DY-mark was 84.4 yuan, and the price of HX-mark was 83.4 yuan. The price of this No. 1 ice sugar was 114 yuan, and the price of Jingming ice sugar was 115 yuan. Also, 6,425 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>
<h3>Sugar Stocks Increase Continuously</h3>
<p>The amount of sugar in this city continues to increase due to successive arrivals. Among them, only the amount of Dutch red raw sugar bowls is reduced compared to before, and the rest have increased. The detailed amounts of each type of sugar are listed below:</p>
<p>Type of Sugar: Stock Amount</p>
<p>Coarse White: 137,405</p>
<p>Dutch Red: 16,784</p>

<h3>Changes to the Number of Members on the Municipal Council Require Approval from the Chinese Government; Consuls of the Three Countries Are Still Consulting on a Solution; Chinese People Express Regret Over the New Distribution</h3>
<p>Reliable sources reported yesterday morning (the 3rd) that the Consuls General of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan stationed in Shanghai are currently consulting and preparing to draft a resolution to change the number of members on the Municipal Council. This proposal will be presented at a special meeting of taxpayers on April 17th. Sources familiar with the matter stated that the details of the resolution will not be disclosed until the resolution is passed by the taxpayers' meeting. It is heard that if this proposal is approved by the taxpayers, it will be submitted to the countries that have treaties with China and the Chinese government for approval. It was not possible to confirm yesterday morning what steps the Consuls General of the three countries would take to obtain the approval of the Chinese government for the change in the number of members on the Municipal Council, as all treaty countries except Japan recognize the Chongqing government as the legitimate government of China.</p>
<h3>Clearly Conflicts with the Land Regulations</h3>
<p>The China Mail reported that the Chinese taxpayers in the Public Concession, although fully aware of the difficulties they and the Municipal Council are currently encountering, opposed the new ratio of the distribution of the number of members on the Municipal Council among the expatriates of various countries. It is claimed that the new method announced by Mr. Philip Felling, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, is in conflict with the provisions of the Yangjingbang Land Regulations. It is anticipated that the Chinese government will protest against this, as the actions of the Municipal Council must be based on the Yangjingbang Land Regulations, which were originally approved by the Chinese government.</p>
<p>Legitimate Chinese Directors Should Be Maintained</p>
<p>Due to the changes in the situation, they and the Municipal Council have many difficulties that must be overcome, but it is hoped that the Municipal Council will do its best to maintain the status of the legitimate Chinese directors who have been re-elected. As for the three Chinese directors who remain in Shanghai, it is not yet known how they will act in response to the current changing situation. It is found that two of the five Chinese directors on the Municipal Council have left Shanghai, and the new ratio of the Municipal Council allows Chinese directors to occupy four seats. The Chinese Taxpayers' Association will push for the election of another new Chinese director. Responsible parties refuse to disclose information. It is heard that important documents and files of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession on Hong Kong Road have been removed. Chinese taxpayers are now afraid that someone may use the reason that the current Chinese directors were illegally re-elected to try to appoint other Chinese directors. However, the orthodox Chinese Taxpayers' Association insists that the Chinese directors were all re-elected in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>May Encounter Considerable Difficulties</p>
<p>However, since Japanese expatriates have a significant stake in the change in the number of members on the Municipal Council, and the Land Regulations stipulate that such matters must be discussed with the Chinese government and approved by them, it is expected that the change in the number of members on the Municipal Council may encounter difficulties. It is heard that the Consuls General of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan will discuss this matter during the current consultations and obtain a satisfactory solution.</p>
<p>Portuguese Community Believes They Should Have a Seat</p>
<p>The Consul General of Portugal in Shanghai, Mr. Melo, told reporters yesterday morning that if there are any changes to the number of members on the Municipal Council, he will do his best to obtain a seat on the board for Portuguese candidates. He shares the same attitude towards the election of the Municipal Council as most other Consuls General, hoping that a solution can be found that is satisfactory to all parties. At the same time, the Portuguese community in Shanghai is increasingly concerned about the election of the Municipal Council and hopes that Portuguese representatives can occupy a seat on the board. It is heard that there are 6,000 Portuguese in Shanghai, one of the oldest expatriate communities in Shanghai. Many Portuguese reside in Shanghai for life. The Portuguese community believes that there are several people who may be nominated as candidates, including Mr. De Weili, a lawyer (De Weili Law Firm), Mr. Lu Li (Lu Li Company), and Mr. Su Chai (Jardine Matheson).</p>
<p>Evolution of the Allocation of Positions on the Municipal Council</p>
<p>According to records, the Municipal Council has had one German director since 1873. In 1911, Mr. F. Fitger, the manager of the German-Chinese Bank, served as a German director and was re-elected until the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Mr. Jecierski, the manager of the Russo-Asiatic Bank, succeeded Fitger as a director until the end of 1918, when the German director position was abolished. It was then stipulated that there would be seven British directors, and one director each for the United States and Japan. The following year, the number of US directors was increased to two. In 1927, the number of Japanese directors was also increased to two, and the number of British directors was reduced to five, which has been maintained to this day. The Japanese community first decided to nominate a director to the Municipal Council in 1916, with six British directors, and one director each for the United States, Japan, and Russia.</p>
<h3>Western Newspapers Express Anxiety About the Situation in Shanghai; Shanghai Is Likely to Become Japan's Property</h3>
<p>Yesterday's editorial in the English-language "China Press" discussed the agreement on the change in the number of members on the current Municipal Council, entitled "The Municipal Council Agreement." The article stated: "The Consuls General of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan have proposed that the current Municipal Council should have three seats each for the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, one seat for Germans, and two seats for other nationalities. From this, it is obvious that future disputes will be between the six votes of the British and American groups and the four votes of the German-Japanese Axis group. The German community in this city is overjoyed at the German obtaining this seat, and even Hitler could not have dreamed of it. Therefore, the German director will naturally follow Berlin's instructions for future motions of the Municipal Council, as he is currently in collusion with Japan. As for the four Chinese directors, all kinds of intimidation and threats they will encounter in the future are to be expected, depending on the courage of the individual. In the past, their position was very good, but the future is unpredictable. The other two nationalities seem to hold the voting power of a motion. If the votes of both sides are the same, the chairman will vote. The problem is that the other two nationalities, if they are countries that are on the Allied side, such as Norway or the Netherlands, will naturally take the same attitude as the United Kingdom and the United States when Japan proposes a radical motion. Although in some cases, Hitler may make his country turn around, and the attitude of the people here will also change, which will ultimately help Japan. The people of European countries that are called neutral countries today may become refugees tomorrow. Even the people of countries such as Switzerland, Portugal, or Sweden may join the British and American groups now, but in a few days, they may be forced to be ordered by the Japanese directors. In short, if Japan wants to control the overall situation, the United Kingdom and the United States must pay attention to the selection of these 'other two nationalities' so that they can obtain a majority of votes after joining the chairman's voting rights. We do not know whether the United Kingdom and the United States have made this plan, but the people of this city are already afraid that Shanghai will become Japan's property. We also sympathize with the fact that Japan should have fair representation and a reasonable voice in the Municipal Council. If Japan achieves its goal and jointly abides by the new status quo, then the angry and unfair words from Hamakita will not be heard in the future. If Japan continues to imitate Hitler's behavior, hoping to get another share after having eaten its fill, then we are unwilling to make any more concessions while these matters have not been resolved. Japan should know that there is nowhere to find a willing sacrifice."</p>
<h3>French Concession Reduces Electricity Consumption; Three Fundamental Principles; Electricity for Public Utilities Such as Trolleys Is Not Reduced; Special Important Factories Have Lighter Electricity Reduction</h3>
<p>Since the French Water and Electricity Company issued a notice on the 15th of last month, advising commercial and industrial users in the concession to earnestly implement electricity reduction measures. As diesel fuel is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain in the future, they should automatically save electricity and reduce consumption. Electricity consumption for road signs, neon lights, and other similar types should be saved, and the company has decided to stop supplying electricity for such city signs. It also stipulates that commercial and industrial households should reduce electricity consumption by 30% of their consumption in the same month last year within a possible range, for users who use more than 500 degrees. This is a temporary measure to save electricity.</p>
<p>Fundamental Measures</p>
<p>The fundamental measures for electricity reduction on the company side are being studied by the Electricity Saving Committee established by the French Municipal Council and the company authorities. First, efforts will be made to eliminate electric heating. Second, non-essential electricity consumption for commerce and industry will also be eliminated after detailed investigation. Third, the company will take practical measures to reduce the overall electricity supply in the concession by 30% compared to the same month last year. These three items are the fundamental principles of electricity saving. The method for dividing paper will be discussed and determined at a meeting within days.</p>
<p>Amount of Electricity Reduction</p>
<p>The largest electricity consumers in the concession recently are larger factories, such as cotton mills, silk mills, rubber factories, egg processing factories, cold storage factories, flour mills, and bakeries. Although it has been decided to reduce electricity consumption in the concession by 30% in the future, the electricity reduction for flour mills, bakeries, and cold storage factories will be lighter, while the electricity reduction for other factories that are not particularly important will be heavier. Commercial and industrial stores will be divided according to their electricity consumption. Households that consume electricity sparingly are also expected to reduce it as much as possible. Public utilities such as trolleys will continue to use the original amount of electricity and will not be reduced.</p>
<p>Advising on Savings</p>
<p>The company has now limited the use of electricity by the largest consumers in the concession. However, because the procedures for household electricity consumption are cumbersome and investigations are time-consuming, there are no measures in place yet. The company hopes that users will understand the company's difficulties in maintaining operations and will save electricity automatically and reduce consumption as much as possible so that the company can overcome the difficult period. Electricity reduction measures are for the benefit of the citizens and are a matter for the entire society. If the source of diesel fuel is cut off in the future and the company cannot maintain operations, the citizens will suffer even more. Therefore, it is hoped that the citizens of the concession will enthusiastically support it.</p>
<p>Diesel Inventory</p>
<p>The company currently consumes more than 1,000 tons of diesel fuel per month, all of which is purchased from foreign countries through foreign merchants. The quantity has decreased compared to before the electricity reduction. As for the diesel inventory, it is sufficient for several months of use. Therefore, the electricity reduction is indeed very necessary. At present, there are 500 user households in the city, among which the largest consumers are Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory, Maochang Air Conditioning Company, Jingxin Dyeing Factory, and cotton and silk factories. When reporters inquired about the fact that the French Concession's electricity supply was not sufficient and a few users had to purchase from the Shanghai Power Company of the Public Concession, it was stated that this had been the case for ten years.</p>
<h3>Stabilizing Civilian Food Supply: Addressing Both Root Causes and Symptoms</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to responsible authorities, the two administrations have now categorized and discussed methods, deciding to address both the root causes and symptoms, to clear domestic and foreign rice and grain sources. In addition, the buying and selling between rice merchants and firms will also be reorganized, and may be announced soon.</p>
<p>Allocation of Ordered Rice</p>
<p>The Shanghai Food Grain Cooperative Association is actively seeking ways to clear and transport and allocate all rice orders that have been completed to various subscribers. The fourth batch of ordered rice has already arrived at the port in separate shipments. The first batch of 485 bags arrived here on March 18th, and the second batch of 488 bags arrived here on March 28th. 464 bags have now been allocated. As for those who have registered, a total of 2,108 households have registered a total of 11,570 bags; the deal has not been completed.</p>
<p>Public Warehouse Payment Demand</p>
<p>The Public Warehouse Management Committee is authorized to store 200,000 bags of rice, of which 80,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice have already been transacted. The rice may be shipped to Shanghai by ship in early May for storage. The committee is making every effort to urge those who have already confirmed the amount but have not paid. It is known that (1) the money exchange industry has not paid for 10,000 bags; (2) the cotton industry has not replied to the letter urging payment for 2,000 bags; (3) Hua Cheng has not fully paid for 2,000 bags; (4) Nanyang has been asked to subscribe to 2,000 bags, but no reply has been received; (5) the paper industry was previously asked to subscribe to 4,000 bags, accounting for half of 170,000 yuan, but no reply has been received; (6) although the machinery and textile industry has confirmed the amount, it has not fully paid, and the committee will send another letter to urge payment.</p>
<p>Decline in Foreign Rice Prices</p>
<p>Since the authorities of the two concessions have taken active measures to stabilize the overall food supply in the city, general goods holders are alarmed, fearing that foreign rice sources will flood in and rice prices will turn to a sharp decline. At that time, they will inevitably suffer unexpected losses, and the so-called assessment has been virtually cancelled, which obviously has no constraints. Therefore, they have successively put stockpiled goods on the market, and the spot market for foreign rice has increased. After the rice market opened yesterday, people's hearts were extremely stable, and the market situation has improved compared with the previous market. As a result, domestic and foreign rice and grain diverge: (1) foreign rice has fallen by about two yuan compared with the previous market; (2) domestic rice has risen by one yuan compared with the previous market.</p>
<h3>Guo Shun in Shanghai, Rumored to Still Go to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Chinese Director Guo Shun was rumored to have left Shanghai for Hong Kong. However, according to the Datong News Agency reporter, Guo is still in Shanghai, but may indeed leave Shanghai soon. The Datong News Agency reporter also visited Guo's residence at 1400 Jing'an Temple Road yesterday morning, and the security was very strict. There were many detectives stationed outside the house. Guo's family members said that Guo had not left Shanghai, but refused to see any guests. According to another source, Guo will indeed leave Shanghai for Hong Kong soon.</p>
<h3>Former French Consul General O'Ren Transferred to Turkey</h3>
<p>The Continental News reported that the former French Consul General in Shanghai, O'Ren, has been appointed as the French Consul General in Istanbul, Turkey. O'Ren left Shanghai half a year ago, and his successor is Major Mattel.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Approves the Issuance of Hotel and Restaurant Licenses</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Police Committee held its annual license meeting on the 21st of last month to review 42 applications for the issuance of annual hotel, tavern, restaurant (兼售酒類 - which also sell alcohol), and beer sales licenses, of which 13 were related to Chinese people. After review, it was considered that the applications were generally in compliance and should be approved or recognized, but the licensees must comply with the regulations of various departments of the Municipal Council before they can proceed. The list is as follows: (1) Hotel category: Applicant name: Zhang Gongda, Address: 678 Hankou Road; (2) Tavern category: Zheng Wei Xian, 447 Yu Qiaqing Road; Zhou Yongwei, 988 Fuxu Road; Wu Ji, 577 Jing'an Temple Road; Feng Meiting, 1193 Jing'an Temple Road; (3) Restaurant category: Zhong Junzhun, 691 Nanjing Road; Li Ze, 720 Nanjing Road; Cui Guichen, 748 Nanjing Road; Zhang Shankun, 280-600 Jing'an Temple Road; (4) Beer sales category: Dou Gansheng, 150 Guangdong Road; Yin Shichang, 858-860 Guangxi Road; Da Sanyuan, 679 Nanjing Road; Yu Guoying, 858-860 Fuxu Road. In addition, the renewal of the said licenses should also be approved together. The case was approved at the regular meeting of the Municipal Council Board of Directors on the 2nd of this month.</p>
<h3>Soviet Merchant Ships Travel Frequently: The Folkov Enters the Port</h3>
<p>The Soviet merchant ship Folkov arrived at the port from Vladivostok at 3:00 pm yesterday. After entering the port, it berthed at floating pontoon numbers 22 and 23. After berthing in Shanghai for two days, it will leave the port. The destination has not been determined. Soviet merchant ships have been traveling frequently recently, which is unprecedented after the Shanghai war.</p>

<h3>American Economic Expert Comments on Japan's Wartime Economy: Unable to Solve Internal and External Difficulties, Lower Standard of Living Makes Further Squeezing Impossible</h3>
<p>American renowned economic expert, Roepke, recently published an article in Newsweek analyzing Japan's economic situation. His conclusion is that the end result will be that Japan will ultimately fail.</p>
<p>Modern Warfare Based on Economy</p>
<p>According to Roepke, among the world powers participating in the war, Japan's wartime economic problems best demonstrate that economic problems in modern warfare are indeed decisive. The lessons learned by Japan can be used as a warning to other countries.</p>
<p>England and Germany Solved Difficulties</p>
<p>The main economic problems of the current war are how to increase the country's production for Germany, and how to purchase goods from abroad for England. Japan must solve both internal and external difficulties at the same time. Germany and England, the former has solved the production problem by relying on its strict management, and the latter has no difficulty in purchasing the goods it needs by relying on its wealth, so the difficulties have also been solved.</p>
<p>Japan Still at a Loss</p>
<p>Japan is still at a loss. First, let's talk about Japan's domestic production problem. Japan also adopted control methods, but its main equipment is not good, and it is impossible to improve it. Compared with German skilled workers, its labor force is far behind, and its standard of living is very low, and it cannot be further squeezed for military use. Therefore, although Japan has tried to imitate the example of Germany to increase domestic production, I am afraid that it will not be very effective.</p>
<p>Failed to Obtain Foreign Loans</p>
<p>Speaking of purchasing goods from abroad, Japan cannot be compared with England. Japan has neither a large amount of gold and foreign wine reserves, nor can it obtain credit loans from foreign countries. Under such circumstances, it is not difficult for discerning people to imagine what kind of results Japan will encounter. (From the upcoming Millard's Review)</p>
<h3>Traffic Police Added Near the Rising Sun Building</h3>
<p>In order to improve the traffic situation on various roads in the Public Concession and for safety reasons, the Municipal Council Police Department has actively strengthened traffic management on various important roads. Recently, eight patrolmen with the "Traffic" badge were sent to Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road (near the Rising Sun Building) to assist in directing traffic and instructing vehicles and pedestrians. Vehicles or pedestrians on intersecting roads are not allowed to cross when the green light is on. This strengthened management method has achieved remarkable results in increasing vehicle speed and strengthening pedestrian safety. Therefore, it will be promoted separately on various important roads.</p>
<h3>Salvation Army Leader Brigadier Beraie Morris Scheduled to Leave Shanghai, All Circles Give Farewell Banquets, Morris to Broadcast Tonight</h3>
<p>Brigadier Beraie Morris, the leader of the Shanghai Salvation Army, has been in office for six years and has been ordered to be transferred to Canada for service. He is scheduled to leave with his wife on the Democratic Radio Station (call sign XMCH) at 9:00 pm today (the 4th) to bid farewell to Shanghai friends. Morris will lead his wife and son Wesley on the President Cleveland liner to Kobe on the morning of the 8th, and then go to Seattle. The location of his service in Canada is not yet known. All circles in this city have a lot of friendship with Morris and have given farewell banquets for him.</p>
<p>Relief for Refugees Faces Difficulties</p>
<p>Morris attended the Rotary Club and gave a speech, expressing his deep gratitude to all circles in the city for helping the Salvation Army to relieve refugees. Morris said that in the 70 years since the Salvation Army was established, the social work it has worked on has never been as difficult as dealing with the refugee problem after the Shanghai war. After the war, no less than 68,000 refugees moved to Shanghai. Thanks to the hard work of various groups, the problem was solved. This move has made a great contribution to Shanghai. He said that he was reluctant to leave Shanghai, but he firmly believed that various groups in Shanghai could continue to work hard to solve the beggar problem, and asked the public not to give alms to street beggars. Morris said that he will leave Shanghai on the President Cleveland liner next Tuesday (the 8th), and his successor, Walker, will come to Shanghai from Tianjin after Easter.</p>
<h3>Tailoring Workers Resumed Work Yesterday, Moving Companies Resumed Business, Garment Industry Strikes Again</h3>
<p>The workers of the Western clothing stores on Sichuan Road North Road in the Public Concession and Xiafei Road in the French Concession have implemented strikes because of improving treatment and demanding that employers increase wages. Now it is known that the labor and management parties are gradually approaching. Starting yesterday morning, the labor party has officially resumed work first, and then discuss the conditions. Therefore, the three Western clothing stores on Sichuan Road, Hubei Road, and Xiafei Road all opened as usual yesterday.</p>
<p>The labor unrest of Shanghai Moving Company was also resolved last night, so it has also resumed work.</p>
<p>The Shanghai and Su-Guang garment makers have recently announced to the work supervisors and stewards that they will increase wages by 50% and a meal allowance of one yuan per person per day because the cost of living has been increasing day by day and wages are not enough to cover expenses. The work supervisors and stewards did not accept it, so some workers have started to strike, and forced other workers who have not stopped working to participate.</p>
<h3>Conte Verde Fuel Replenishment Completed, Rumors of Sneaking Out Yesterday, But the Italian Postal Shipping Company Denied It</h3>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post said that although the Italian Postal Shipping Company in this city has denied that its Conte Verde ship will be transferred, it is rumored today (the 3rd) that the ship will indeed sneak out tomorrow (the 4th) or at the end of this week. It is verified that the Conte Verde is a giant ship that burns oil. Since Italy's participation in the war in June last year, it has been trapped in Shanghai. It is believed that the ship has gradually prepared the fuel necessary for exporting. According to the beginning of the European War in 1939, the Ramses ship of the German Henmei Shipping Company, which was trapped in Shanghai, secretly left Shanghai last Saturday, and it is not known where it went.</p>
<p>Italian Post Office Company Denied Yesterday</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that the staff of the Italian Postal Shipping Company in this city denied yesterday morning that the company's Conte Verde would follow in the footsteps of the German ship Rheimsass and leave Shanghai. Although it is rumored that the ship will leave Shanghai for Kobe, the ship was still berthed near Yangshupu Lan Road as of last night. The ship remained in Shanghai after Italy's participation in the war. According to the company's staff, the ship will continue to stay in Shanghai and leave after the end of the European War. When the reporter asked whether the Axis powers are now ordering Italian ships to leave the ports of South America, and whether this order will be extended to Shanghai, the staff replied that it is technically difficult to implement this method in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Children's Day and Common Sense of Child Rearing</h3>
<p>The Children's Day of the thirtieth year is launched again in a warm mood. Although the ways of celebration are different every year, the meaning of celebration is not consistent. People in society have been progressing year by year in their understanding of this kind of movement; and those who participate in child care work are also increasing day by day. The long-term plan of cultivating people for a hundred years is truly a phenomenon of social progress and a sign of the revival of our national country. The author often likes to repeatedly state the common sense of child rearing for parents. At this festival, I hope that all children in the country have healthy bodies. I will contribute one or two to the parents of the world as far as my humble opinions are concerned.</p>
<p>(1) To avoid the spread of diseases, children's body tissues are delicate and their resistance to germs is weak, so they are easily infected with diseases. Therefore, first, do not allow them to approach anyone who is sick, and do not go to crowded places. Nannies and caregivers of children must choose healthy people. If the mother or nanny occasionally has a cold and cough, she should use a towel or mouth cover to cover her mouth when breastfeeding. Never use your mouth to face the child's mouth or kiss the child. Do not give the child food that has been chewed in your mouth, that is even more unhygienic. The pacifiers and toys used by children daily must be washed and cleaned before they can be put into the mouth. If parents have lung disease after the child is born, they should be immediately isolated. When a person coughs or sneezes, they must cover their mouth with a towel or palm. Do not spit sputum everywhere. Injecting 5% carbolic acid water into the spittoon can kill tuberculosis bacteria and prevent infection of others. Patients must have disease morality. The so-called "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." Extra attention should be paid to a young and weak infant.</p>
<p>(2) Take more fresh air and sunlight. In the weather of gentle breeze and bright sunshine, even a child who is only one month old can be taken to the public garden to live outdoors for two hours every day. It is often seen that people are often afraid of children being exposed to the wind. Because of the fear of the wind, even the air in the bedroom is not allowed to circulate. Half of the diseases are even more tightly closed windows and heavy curtains. In fact, as long as we wear a hat on our head and wear warm clothes on our body, even if cold air blows in and enters the lungs through the nasal cavity and trachea, the cold air has become warm from cold, and it does not make people catch cold, nor does it cause a cold because of this. The reason for catching a cold is definitely not here. When the author was in Germany before, I saw a child with measles (commonly known as getting the rash) who also suffered from pneumonia. They wrapped the child's head and body warmly and placed him in the corridor or garden. Because there was sufficient fresh air, the pneumonia healed in a few days, and the measles was of course no problem. Under such air, measles lung tuberculosis (commonly known as rash tuberculosis) will certainly not be there. When Chinese people hear this situation, they may think I am talking in my sleep, but this is obviously a fact. Some people say that Europeans are different from Chinese people in physique, but based on the actual situation, given the high mortality rate of measles in Chinese children, we should also improve and improve, and try to get some fresh air as much as possible! In 1934, there were two twins in a pediatric hospital in Vienna who had whooping cough at the same time. The doctor took one child without any medication and placed him in the open air, while the other child was locked in the house and only used medication. As a result, the one who was in the open air all day recovered quickly. Furthermore, from the statistics of hundreds of children, when they arrived in the countryside, in the embrace of nature, their weight increased day by day. When they arrived in the city, even if they ate tonics every day, their weight still decreased. These all give us clear proof that air and sunlight are indispensable to us humans, just like fish to water.</p>
<p>(3) What is nutrition? Sufficient nutrition can make oneself generate resistance and reduce diseases, but in this year of soaring prices, we should also take into account the economic aspect, so meat is too expensive, you can eat spinach tofu instead, milk is too expensive, you can eat soy milk instead, fruit is too expensive, you can use Su Ying soup instead. Do not only care about what you like to eat, but forget the original quality of nutrition. If a child who is one year old or almost two years old is still only eating breast milk, this is not the way to truly love the child. That kind of one-sided nutrition can make the child fall into a very weak place, and therefore diseases arise. A child who is one month old can be given orange juice every day in addition to breast milk (tomato juice and vegetable soup can also be used instead) and boiled water. A child who is two or three months old can be given cod liver oil (for four to six weeks). After five or six months, add a paste-like food every day, such as porridge, yam, spinach, pig liver, etc., which can be made into a paste and fed. Then, after ten months, they will naturally be weaned. When a person is sick, they should also pay attention to nutrition during illness. Most families usually only care about eating indiscriminately. Once they have a fever or get sick, they stop eating everything. In fact, when people have a fever, the consumption of vitamins and various nutrients is very high, and it is necessary to have a corresponding supplement in order to resist diseases. Folk customs are very strict in restricting the food of children with measles, and they also say that they must eat forty days of pure vegetarian food, so that nutrition is lacking, and diseases such as tuberculosis take advantage of the deficiency. Therefore, when you are sick, you should also listen to the doctor's instructions and pay attention to nutrition. Generally speaking, all light, fluid, fresh, nutritious and easily digestible foods can still be eaten. Children's food not only provides for their lives, but also develops their bodies, which is more important than adults.</p>
<p>Love my love and the love of others, young my young and the young of others. I hope that those in the world whose children are well and have enough food and clothing will do what I can to help children who are without clothes or food and who are sick. Although Children's Day is only one day a year, the days we need to work hard are always endless. What do you think of the virtuous parents? (Su Zengxiang)</p>

<h3>French Municipal Council Translator Dong Shu Assassinated Yesterday, Encountered Violence on the Way Home for Lunch, Shot Twice and Died on the Spot</h3>
<p>At 12:15 yesterday noon, a sniping blood case occurred on Maxwell Tilo Road in the French Concession. The person who was shot and killed was Dong Shu, a translator of the French Municipal Council from Fujian. The details of the case are as follows:</p>
<p>Two Bullets in the Body</p>
<p>Dong Shu, a translator from Fujian at the printing house of the French Municipal Council, whose style name was Xiaohan, was 42 years old. He graduated from Aurora University in his early years and has been in this position for 19 years. He currently lives at 223 Lagna Road in the French Concession, and acts as a second landlord. Yesterday morning, Dong was wearing a gray tweed jacket, wearing platinum-rimmed crystal glasses, bald, and without a hat. As usual, he went to the Municipal Council to work. At noon, he returned home for lunch. When Dong was walking on Songshan Road and turned to Maxwell Tilo Road, near the eastern side of the road in front of the Taichang Western Clothing Store at No. 1, a man in a black coat suddenly jumped out from the corner of the road. The man immediately drew a gun and fired two shots at him. Both shots hit Dong's back and penetrated his chest. He immediately fell to the ground, blood flowed everywhere, and he died on the spot. The shooter, seeing that his purpose had been achieved, fled to the southwest without a trace.</p>
<p>Arrest a Suspect</p>
<p>At that time, the nearby guards heard the gunshots and rushed to the scene. The shooter had already escaped without a trace. They immediately reported to the police station. The Songshan Road police station was nearby and immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to cut off traffic on the nearby roads and conduct a strict search. Pedestrians and vehicles were searched, but nothing was found. The corpse of Dong was moved to the autopsy office to await examination. Dong's wife, Liu (41 years old), gave birth to four daughters and two sons. The eldest daughter, Shi Mei, is currently studying at Southwest Associated University. The second daughter, Kai Sheng, is currently studying at the Obstetrics and Gynecology School on Sapo Sai Road. The third daughter is studying at Xiaoguang Middle School. The remaining one daughter and two sons are all young. It is heard that the police station arrested a suspect surnamed Zhang nearby after the incident.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping for Ransom: Criminals Convicted, Guns and Ammunition Confiscated</h3>
<p>Chen Qilin and others who kidnapped Wu Yuangen, Wang Baohua, Xu Busun, Zhu Hegao, Shen Jicang, Sun Zhizhai, Hu Zude, etc., for ransom, and robbed the Shanghai Brewery were arrested by the Central Police Station and sent to the First Special Court. The public prosecutor filed a public prosecution based on the victims and the gang robbery. Chief Judge Feng held a special court to conduct more than eight trials before the case was concluded.

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I recently read a news item in your paper regarding the arrest of a retired military officer, which mentioned a Mr. Zhou residing at No. 120 Ladu Road. Upon investigation, the above address is where I reside, and no one named Zhou has ever lived in this house. I am concerned that this may lead to misinformation. Therefore, I am writing this letter to clarify the situation and respectfully request that you make a correction.</p>

<h3>Children's Education</h3>
<p>— Jue Hui</p>
<p>Children's Day—a day for children; however, "adults" should also be given a mention.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "It is the father's fault if children are not educated." If education is absurd, it is even "more of a fault" than "not educating" at all!</p>
<p>Often, children do not even know who the national leader is or why there is a war; however, they know exactly what a hula dance is or the one hundred and several dozen tiles in mahjong. If this continues, alas!</p>
<p>It's fine if they are not educated and don't understand; but if they are educated absurdly, although they understand, they understand the wrong path, not the right path.</p>
<p>Not understanding is just not understanding; understanding the wrong path means the child's life is over!</p>
<p>Furthermore: "If the teacher is not strict, he is lazy." There are many primary school teachers who are "serving the public on an empty stomach" these days... (Those who are "adults" will naturally know the rest.)</p>
<p>Children are innocent and unformed, and they will learn whatever they are taught. If taught well, they will achieve great things; if taught poorly, it will be dangerous!</p>
<p>Especially the "wealthy adults," I hope they will think this over again and again!</p>
<h3>Sending Children to Nursery School</h3>
<p>— Ping Niang</p>
<p>She is a teacher and a writer, but she has three children under school age at home. What can this allow her to do? After teaching, she comes home to find either a big child with a broken head or a little one with a stomachache. Although each child has a nanny or wet nurse, they lack both hygiene and education, and they are bound to be lazy and negligent, or even abuse them, behind the mistress's back. Her husband often teases her, saying, "She sacrifices her own field to cultivate others' fields," and sometimes even laughs at her for "being fond of being a teacher." In this environment, she had no choice but to give up her beloved students and sacrifice her career for her children.</p>
<p>So she stayed at home, thinking she could at least engage in writing. But look at her writing career: as soon as she picked up her pen, the two-year-old child who loved to follow his mother cried, "Mommy, Mommy." He took the pen and climbed onto the desk, asking Mom for paper to write on. Just when she gave him paper and ordered him to write at his small table (actually scribbling), the wet nurse brought the crying little one, who insisted on being close to Mom. Just when she got rid of them, the big child brought picture books and asked Mom to tell him stories. Thus, the three children kept coming to her one after another, and how could she write a single word? She remembered what her friend told her: Du Jun worked hard at writing, and her book on women's issues was written with three or four children surrounding her, and she was financially strapped, without a nanny to take care of the children. I didn't have any children around me at that time, so I didn't find it strange. Now that I think about it, it was a miracle! Maybe my friend made up that story to encourage me to write. Otherwise, unless those children were so oppressed that they were like wooden chickens.</p>
<p>She was unwilling to have her life ruined by her children. Although some people would try to comfort her with the words, "Household matters are as important as social affairs," and "Educating your children is the same as engaging in education in society, and the achievements are not small," she felt that those were just self-deprecating words!</p>
<p>She sent her eldest child to kindergarten—a kindergarten that emphasizes play and does not focus on rote learning. The three-year-old was treated as a four-year-old. The person who took care of him was only responsible for picking him up and dropping him off. Economically, it only increased expenses, and it did not reduce the need for a servant, but the mother felt that she had relieved some of the entanglement. This went on for a year.</p>
<p>Now the biggest problem is the second one. He can move freely and wants to turn everything over, whether it's Dad's or Mom's. Because he spilled tea, he broke the teacup; because he wanted to dress up after washing his face, he spilled all the snow cream and talcum powder on the floor; because he wanted a haircut, he smeared Vaseline all over his head, face, and palms; because he wanted to put the nickel into the piggy bank, his mother's purse was constantly being robbed; because he fought with his older brother and younger brother, he cried and shouted; because he was raised by his grandmother to eat candy and snacks, he was constantly clamoring for something to eat; because he was raised by his father to not listen unless beaten, he was not easily persuaded by kind words. Everyone says he is the naughtiest, but his mother is quite sympathetic to him, understands him, and spends more time dealing with him. Therefore, sending one away did not help the mother.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the YWCA founded a "childcare center for working women." She felt that although she could not be considered a working woman, it was precisely because the child problem was not resolved that she was stuck at home. She was not willing to have her life ruined by her children, but the children were too young and there was nowhere to send them. Now that there was a childcare center, she could solve the problem of the child who was the most troublesome. So, she signed up first.</p>
<p>He entered the center at the age of two years and four months, just the right age, and his health was quite good. On March 1st, he left early and returned late, just like a primary school student. (He doesn't understand what a childcare center is, he only knows that he's going to school.) The mother really felt liberated when she sent the two children out every day. She could look at picture books, write regularly, and occasionally hug and play with the youngest one, which could serve as an adjustment to her busy life.</p>
<p>She sometimes felt sorry: perhaps this child's troubles were now on the heads of the childcare center teachers. But after a week, two weeks, three weeks, it was said that this child did not require them to spend too much effort at the childcare center. They liked him very much, and he was happy to go. This mother truly felt relieved of a worry.</p>
<h3>Warning</h3>
<p>— Ling Tong</p>
<p>According to astronomical measurements: not only is the rainy season starting early this year, but the flooding is especially severe, the most in decades. This humid air contains a substance that easily damages everything, and the color often turns black, making it impossible to clean. Liquids, solids, and gases cannot resist it, and it is not advisable to store anything. For rice and other grains containing water, chemical reactions will cause other changes to occur. (See this paper's March 28th issue, fully copied, hereby declared.)</p>
<h3>The Responsibility of Being Parents: Thoughts on Children's Day</h3>
<p>— Xu Daming</p>
<p>There is no parent who does not love their children. However, the methods of showing love are obviously different. Some focus on providing expensive food, clothing, and taking children to play everywhere as a way of showing love; others add spiritual love—education—to the above two kinds of material love. Of course, the two are practically inseparable, because enjoying play is another kind of "education" that is easier for children to remember, and this kind of "education" often has good results, especially when parents treat their children as "treasures" and "darlings," and children are receptive to it. Moreover, most parents almost completely ignore the importance of family education, and often push all the responsibility of education onto the school. It seems that children only receive instruction from teachers at school, and parents bear no responsibility at all. Therefore, children do whatever they want at home, and the connection between school and home is lost. This phenomenon must be overcome today, because it is a loss for children!</p>
<p>Secondly, the family must not only establish contact with the school so that their children can make real progress, but also play another role in the middle—supervising the teachers so that they cannot be careless about children's education, because parents' inquiries will force teachers to pay attention to everything about the children, and the effect is also to help the children. Furthermore, if parents have a clearer understanding, they can use this opportunity to become familiar with whether a teacher's thinking is correct, whether the teaching methods need to be improved, etc.; if a teacher's thinking is problematic, parents can jointly propose an impeachment. This is a way to promote the spirit of democracy, and parents must take this responsibility for the future of their children.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I once saw an illustration in this paper depicting the "family education" that children receive at home: the method of teaching mathematics is "mahjong" (the characters for one to nine of ten thousands, circles, etc.), and the teaching aids for English lessons are "playing cards" (A.K.Q.J., etc.). So adults gamble, and children watch by the side, and some parents even teach their children what this is and what that is.</p>
<p>We must protest against such parents. This is definitely not a way to make children learn well. On the contrary, it is ruining your children's future. Such parents should bear the name of "criminals against children." Then, if teachers hear about this situation from children, the school authorities can also write letters to advise them to respect children's studies as the most important thing.</p>
<p>In short, both schools and parents should have this correct understanding—children belong to the country, to the nation, and they are definitely not your or my own private property. Therefore, if children are good, the whole nation is good, not just your own "money tree." Our education of children is also to fulfill our responsibility to the nation and the country, and this most important premise must be clearly recognized.</p>
<p>As for children who are too poor to go to school, we cannot ignore their education either. Perhaps there are children with very good talents here who are being buried.</p>
<p>Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to speak out for disadvantaged children, hoping that people in society will also consider the education of disadvantaged children as their own business and provide practical assistance—opening more street children's schools, etc., would probably be more useful than spending hundreds of thousands of funds to build a children's library! Moreover, the significance of this kind of thing today far exceeds that of a children's library. I hope that we can quickly extend a hand of sympathy, because this is not only a great gift to children, but also another responsibility of parents!</p>
<h3>Chinese Flowering Crabapple</h3>
<p>— Qin Shou'ou</p>
<p>(6) Product of Love</p>
<p>"Husband, but who is my husband? Yuan Baofan, he is only the enemy who killed my mother, how can he be considered my husband! It is true that wealthy people can marry three wives and four concubines, and in our China, it is a matter of course. I cannot forbid him; but if he wants to marry a mistress, he should find her from among those prostitutes and other women of suitable status, and should not defile a maiden from a clean family. Moreover, it is not a matter of mutual consent at all, but he used extremely vile and shameless means to set up a scam, causing my whole family to fall into this trap. Therefore, I feel that I am not only not his wife, but also not his mistress, but a prisoner imprisoned by him! Based on these reasons, late last night, I told...—"</p>
<p>"Ah!" Chinese Flowering Crabapple almost cried out in shock.</p>
<p>"...the spirit of my mother. I lit incense and prayed sincerely before her spirit tablet for dozens of minutes. Now my heart is completely at peace, and I believe that my mother in the underworld must also feel very comforted...!"</p>
<p>Chinese Flowering Crabapple's heart also calmed down, and he couldn't help but breathe a deep sigh of relief: a triumphant smile immediately appeared on his face.</p>
<p>"...! From now on, I hope that you can always treat me like a member of your family. I myself am determined to always love you; as long as there is an opportunity, I will definitely find a way to jump out of the Yuan family's cage...!"</p>
<p>He couldn't help but hug those pages of letters to his chest, cherishing them like a person, before putting them down after a long time to continue reading.</p>
<p>"...Your occupation and environment are different from others, so you must be extra careful in your actions in the future. A person like him will never treat murder as a thing..."</p>
<p>Xiangqi's few words of advice were really not an overestimation. Chinese Flowering Crabapple himself had also heard Yuan Shaowen say that once, one of Yuan Zhenshou's subordinates who handled documents had an affair with a maid in his family, and on the day of discovery, he was shot dead by Yuan Baofan himself with a pistol. Speaking of this person's father, he was still a sworn brother who served as a small soldier with the old Yuan in Baoding! (72)</p>

<p>New Film Introduction</p>
<h3>The Peacock Flies Southeast</h3>
<p>— Meng Gongwei</p>
<p>The "historical drama" trend has passed, and I heard that several historical dramas that have been completed or are about to be completed cannot be sold. The adaptation of "The Peacock Flies Southeast" into a modern drama is ahead of the trend.</p>
<p>"The Peacock Flies Southeast" performed in modern dress is very different from the ancient poem "The Peacock Flies Southeast, Turning Back Every Five Li." The difference lies not only in the costumes, but also in the addition and deletion of characters and changes in the plot. The same is only the names of the male and female protagonists and the outline of the story.</p>
<p>The addition and deletion of characters is related to the change in the plot. The little sister-in-law in the original poem is not here, but the uncle Lu Shun and the farmhand A Niu are added. This is for the development of the plot. In my opinion, it doesn't matter to add or delete characters to strengthen the atmosphere or facilitate the development of the plot. The problem lies in whether the spirit of the original work is damaged by adding or deleting characters.</p>
<p>In the case of "The Peacock Flies Southeast," the original poem and the film have two different sentiments: the gentle and sad mood of the original poem is not in the film, but the film expands the field of vision and enhances the social significance. Let's not talk about whether this adaptation method is meritorious or sinful (in my personal opinion, I agree with being faithful to the times rather than being faithful to the original), at least to a limited extent, in the current trend of movies, it has broken away from the false resurrection of putting modern clothes on living corpses. And this so-called modern film of the "false resurrection" type is very likely to become a new trend after "historical dramas."</p>
<p>The original poem of "The Peacock Flies Southeast" is a lament of the weak under the heavy pressure of feudal society. Because of the author's era, it exposes the tragedy advocated by the feudal system and contains anger at the feudal system, but it is only a lament and a call. As for the film "The Peacock Flies Southeast," it has been adapted, and the background of the era has become the present. This is the greatest cleverness and greatest benefit of the adapter. Of course, the current view of the relationship between men and women may have to be revised in a few years, or even it is impossible and there will be no more things like Jiao Zhongqing and Lan Zhi, but comparing the original poem and the film, the viewpoint is much more advanced, and this is also an example that the times are always moving forward.</p>
<p>From the perspective of script writing and directing techniques, "The Peacock Flies Southeast" can also be ranked among the best in recent domestic films. "The Peacock Flies Southeast" was originally a very touching story. With good writing and directing, and with Hu Die, who has been out of the spotlight for a long time, playing the lead role, the box office revenue should be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Hu Die's acting skills in this film are very great. We haven't seen actors with internal performances in domestic films for a long time, but Hu Die has it in this film; we have also felt for a long time that the actor's temperament and the temperament of the character in the play cannot be matched, but Hu Die in this film unifies them.</p>
<p>As for other actors, Wang Wulung is too old and his movements are too exaggerated. Wang Naidong's movements are okay, but his Mandarin is not pure. Gu Wenzong's movements, language, and makeup are too exaggerated. At first glance, it is almost suspected that he is an actor who has been performing Cantonese opera for a long time. It is worth mentioning that Li Jingbo's A Niu and Bai Yin's Cai Lian performed very well.</p>

<h3>The Ideal Cast of Peking Opera Actors Performing the Play "Home"</h3>
<p>— Hai</p>
<p>Many Peking opera actors are very interested in plays. The year before last, the actors and cultural figures jointly performed "Thunderstorm" at the Carlton Theatre, which further increased their interest. Originally, they planned to form a "Lonely Devil Troupe" and stipulated that the script for the first performance would be "Parasitic Grass," but it did not materialize, which is a pity.</p>
<p>Ma Jin's "Home" was performed at the Lafayette Theatre, creating a record of 127 full houses. Many actors went to see it and praised the play very much. I think if they could jointly perform "Home," it would definitely cause a sensation, and I have also drafted an ideal cast for them. Yesterday, at the welcome banquet and celebration banquet for the Xun Hui Troupe at the Actors' Union Property Association, I mentioned this matter. Zhou Xinfang, Gao Baisui, Zhao Ruquan, and Li Ruchun all agreed very much and were eager to try. Baisui said excitedly: "After the Xun Troupe performs the charity show, we can prepare to perform "Home." I will write down the ideal cast of "Home" below as a reference for assigning actors in the future.</p>

<h3>Blood Rain in the Qiong Garden</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Red Skirt Jealousy - Kills Pomegranate Flowers</p>
<p>When Zhou Qiyu, the governor of Yansui, was ordered to suppress the bandits, he was the governor of the five provinces, holding great power, and the momentum of the bandits was also expanding, from Shaanxi to Shanxi, Henan, Huguang, Sichuan and other provinces, attacking and occupying dozens of states and counties, and even the ancient Kuizhou, known as a natural danger, was lost. Zhou Qiyu then went to Junzhou and ordered the four governors of Shaanxi, Henan, etc. to block the bandits on all sides. They won more than a dozen battles, and many bandits died, and their momentum was slightly frustrated. So Zhang Xianzhong fled to Shangluo, and Li Zicheng and others fled into the Chexiang Gorge in Xing'an. Unexpectedly, the Chexiang Gorge was surrounded by steep mountains on all sides, and the middle spanned forty miles. Once inside, it was like being in a box, easy to enter but difficult to exit. When the residents of the mountains learned the news that the bandits had mistakenly entered, they were overjoyed. Some threw down large stones, some threw down torches, and they blocked the entrance of the gorge with stones, so that the bandits' way of life in the gorge was cut off and they were in danger of starvation. In addition, God sent down twenty days of heavy rain, and the bandits' bows and arrows were all taken off, and the horses lacked fodder, and many people died. If they could not get out again, they would starve to death in the gorge. Li Zicheng used the plan of his subordinate strategist and sent someone to risk going out of the gorge to pretend to surrender to Zhou Qiyu's camp. Zhou Qiyu made many great achievements and inevitably became arrogant, and in order to settle the matter as soon as possible, he rashly agreed, so more than 36,000 bandits were able to survive. Zhou Qiyu was about to compile and send them back to farming, but how did he know that as soon as the bandits left the gorge, they suddenly rioted and killed all the officials who had come to appease them, and they rekindled the flames and rebelled again. This was the first time. At another time, when Zhang Xianzhong's troops secretly attacked Nanyang, they happened to meet Zuo Liangyu, and the two sides fought fiercely. Xianzhong could not defeat them and led his troops to escape, but he was chased by Zuo Liangyu. The two horses were not far apart. Zuo Liangyu drew his bow and shot an arrow, which hit Zhang Xianzhong's eyebrow, and another arrow hit his middle finger. Xianzhong had no choice but to turn his horse to resist, but Zuo Liangyu slashed him in the face with a knife, and blood flowed to his shoulder, and he almost fell off his horse. At that time, Sun Kewang, a subordinate of Xianzhong, stepped forward to block him and rescued Xianzhong. Liangyu pursued him to Gucheng, and Xianzhong then asked Supervisor Xiong Wencan to surrender. Liangyu knew that the bandits were deceitful, so he offered Xiong Wencan a plan to lure all the bandits to kill them and prevent future troubles. Who knew that Xiong Wencan was bound by the theory of benevolence and righteousness and believed that killing surrendering people was unlucky, so he refused to listen to Liangyu's words. Later, as expected, Zhang Xianzhong supported his troops and did not obey the dispatch, and rebelled again in Gucheng. This was the second time he missed the opportunity. It shows that the governor's troops were mediocre and incompetent, and the main appeasement was in debt. (29)</p>
<h3>The Philosophy of a Life of Struggle</h3>
<p>— Zong Yu</p>
<p>Struggle requires sacrifice, that is inevitable; but sacrifice must be necessary, sacrifice must have returns. When there is no need to sacrifice, never sacrifice lightly; sacrifice is waste. It is best to sacrifice one part and reap ten parts; at the very least, the sacrifice should be equal to the harvest.</p>
