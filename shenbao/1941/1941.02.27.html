<h3>格魯昨訪松岡</h3>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>松岡外交之剖析</h3>
<p>當本月四日日外相松岡在議會答覆質問的時候，曾經表示：只要於日本有利，兩面三面以至多面的外交，都不妨採取；就近頃日方外交動向來看，松岡確在嘗試他所憧憬的理論。</p>
<p>以松岡外交與其前任的有田野村以至宇垣廣田相比較，確要推松岡為比較活躍；他不像其歷屆前任者那樣執着於一種信念，也不顧慮其所發言論及所採步驟將發生何等後果，他比較輕率的發言，比較輕率的鑽營；但一到遭逢重大反響和阻力，便立時轉向，別以一副面目，一種口吻來應付。是以世人縱然除却「建立大東亞共榮圈」「絕對忠實於三國聯盟」一類抽象名詞而外，不大容易理解松崗外交的真意何在，然而對於他的作風却都耳熟能詳。所謂多角外交，與三國同盟固若不甚調和，無疑那正是松岡外交的真面目。</p>
<p>自從遠東危機陡形嚴重以來，日本在外交上頗現出積極的姿態：日本派赴德義的軍事使節圍已趕達德國，三國同盟的技術委員會也正式成立；對於蘇聯於十七日起開始兩國經濟談判，並亟謀不侵條約的締結；對於南洋各單位，一方繼續進行着荷印越南的經濟交涉，一方導演着泰越的停戰與和平談判；對於美國，除力謀藉野村之力緩和美方反感和重壓而外，更一再表示日本的「和平」意旨；尤其對於英國，十七日由日使重光訪英外次勃特勒解釋日方態度，送上松岡所謂建議停戰的文件，二十四日英首相邱吉爾又招重光會談，手交英方備忘錄，並申明英方對日的基本態度。在以上種種接觸而外，松岡更屢在議會作種種關於外交的答辯，而尤以廿四日所謂應以大洋洲讓予亞洲人的宣言，最為刺激舉世的視聽。像這樣的佻　，這樣玩弄，固屬表示了活躍的外交姿態，亦適足暴露其無信念無誠意，只是以到處虛相委蛇的態度來作多方的應付而已。這不僅其對英美蘇聯為然，甚至即於其所深相結託的軸心盟友亦復如此；其最近對英的外交運用，雖是他一貫的運用手段，却故意表示其並未以其前途一切完全寄託於軸心方面的盟約關係。這種外交，既非革新，又非保守，只能算是投機的權術。</p>
<p>察彼這樣的多角關係之中，倒也並非沒有緩急輕重之分：以德義與蘇聯較，則對前者不過希望保持已有的結託以待未來的演變，於後者則屬望至殷亟求在外交關係上有所成就；在英美兩國之間，則對美僅望緩和其反感與重壓於一時，對於英國則懷有重大幻想以至陰謀。本來，分化英美雙方對遠東的政策是近若干年來日本外交的一貫傳統，在已入也未嘗不曾收到一時的與局部的功效，而尤以歐戰未發之前與法國敗北之後兩個時期最為顯著，但終以三國盟約的締約促成了英美在遠東合作的實現；近五個月來，英美始終採取着平行政策，最近應急設施的着着實現，更在遠東危局之中闢一新紀元。不過英美立塲雖同，處境則大相逕庭，美國對於西太平洋有充分運用的自由，英方則不能不受歐洲戰事的牽制，而在遠東實際的戰略形勢上，則在美方對於西太平洋的防務佈置尙未完成，且大部艦隊未開逾夏威夷以西之前，主要的還要靠英國陸海實力來撑持。加以英國內部綏靖主義的殘餘分子仍有相當勢力存在，多少還存有希望日本與德義分離的迷夢。這些情形，都是引起日本幻想的因素，同時也說明了最近英日間屢有外交接觸，甚至松岡獨向英國作其和平攻勢試探的原因。</p>
<p>邱吉爾在接見重光時所表示的「英國在遠東之防禦，僅屬自衛性質，並非對日攻勢之措置」，也許會使人疑慮到是已往張伯倫——克萊琪政策路綫的復活；其實，馬來澳軍的增防，海峽水雷的佈置，以至前此種種實際的備戰行動，都比較這一外交詞令更足以表現英方近頃的真切態度。英當局不願戰爭波及遠東以便一意對付德國，這當然是事實，但是這些皆是比較的，幷且有限度的，蓋英國鑒於已往的覆轍，可信英方不致為此而付出重大代價。何况遠東問題的最大決定力在於美國，適當美國以全力支援英文之際，英國的遠東政策斷不會與美相距過遠，同時也就可見分化英美對遠東陣容的計謀斷無獲得任何成就的可能。假如松岡以大洋洲讓予亞人的建議是根據其對英幻想而做為交換條件提出的，則澳政府已予以明確的答覆：「日人愈南進，澳人愈北進」。而松岡多角外交的前途，終於只是隨着日本的進退支絀而歸於幻滅。</p>

<h3>希特勒演矢全文</h3>
<p>德國經濟政策</p>
<p>吾人應遵行可使德國民族獲益之經濟政策、政府之經濟政策應以全國人民之利益爲依據、不應築於資本主義基礎之上、人民必有醒悟之一日、故凡實行資本主義經濟政策之國家、結果其財政必將陷於崩潰、此次戰事勝利之後、金本位將漸失其效用、將來之人民將不再向銀行進行其商業、取而代之者將爲物物交換及淸算制度、德國爲一生產與消耗之重大因素、故其他民族必自願與德國從事商業、不顧銀行之態度爲何、余從未要求美國或其他國家貸予黃金、蓋吾人並不需要黃金、任彼等守住其黃金可矣、但吾國之經濟政策、決不致因此而如紐約或倫敦之銀行家所言、陷於不振、要知德國之經濟政策、乃以全民族之利益爲唯一前提、余歷次向英法所提出之建議、英法始終淡然置之、反視爲可笑無稽、由此可知需要</p>
<p>被迫訴諸戰爭</p>
<p>最近美國某將領曾在美衆院外交委員會宣稱邱吉爾曾於一九三六年向其申言德國日趨强盛英國必須設法摧毀之、自此邱吉爾遂從事毀滅德國之準備、當時余曾向其警吿、但英國某政黨得猶太人之煽動、一心需要戰爭、挽回無望、余乃實行武裝全國、諸君皆知余一言旣出、定必貫澈行之、今已大功吿成、數年內軍備之成就、可以傲視全球矣、時至今日、德國民心一致、全國人民與黨軍精誠團結、共爲國家禦傷、故謂德國將重演一九一八年之敗績、實不啻愚人矣、吾國之敵人曾謂德將於戰爭爆發後之六星期內發生革命、但彼等並非指明德國何人將領等此革命、德國並鉀革命份子、英美兩國則有之、彼等咸願將其總部設於距離戰塲較遠之國家、余實亦不知何人將在德國領導革命、目不知革命將如何發生、但有一事余所知者、即德國有若干愚人、但彼等決不致發動革命、敵人且謂德國至冬季必將屈服、但德國今已度過此冬季、不知敵人有何感想、余相信發生饑饉者、將非吾國而爲敵國、余敢言敵人之希望均屬空想、</p>
<p>抱有勝利信念</p>
<p>余得身經此次轟轟烈烈之戰爭深以爲榮德國發揮威力之時已屆余視正等待率領大軍百萬進攻敵人之時機、一鼓而擊潰之、德國國社黨將目擊一九四一年爲決定戰事之一年、此爲吾全體黨員所　抱之堅定之信心、吾人相信世間之公理、吾人相信數年之艱苦奮鬥、必能獲得勝利、今有一事余願公吿諸君者、即余觀望敵人之時、一無畏懼、深知敵人每一政治領袖、均係代表其本身階級之利益、擁護彼等者非猶太人即金錢、余知敵人之人民、將爲吾國人民意志之執行者、余深信上蒼在此次戰爭之後、必再將保佑德國民族、</p>
<p>二十年前余第一次步入此酒審之時、無籍籍之名、無赫赫之功、當時余所懷抱之志願、即在此二十一年內創造一新世界、余敢言今後吾黨同志所將邁進之路、較二十一年來所經過之路將輕便多矣、今日德國將勇往直前、繼續前進、希特勒演說畢、全體老黨員高呼「前進」口號而散，（廿五日海通電）（完）</p>

<h3>日南進觀望之際美國應加緊援華美總統代表已建議三項惟須利用時機迅予接濟本埠西報敷陳立卽發動之得失</h3>
<p>大陸報社評云、美國羅斯福總統私人代表居禮博士、及美經濟學家台斯德爾斯君來華、調查如何協助重慶之中國政府、今於行將返美之際、如有人希望此二人回國、能加速美國對華之援助、則此種希望、甚爲合理、此貴賓二人、對於中國之戰時情形、及獲得作　成功之所需要者、均已有密切之硏究、彼等不久即將乘機飛返美國、向白宮呈報其調查所得之結果、</p>
<p>建議對華增高援助</p>
<p>據重慶力面報紙記載稱、居禮博士自抵重慶後、即已與華盛頓保持無錢電接觸、據稱、居禮博士甚至向羅斯福總統建議、增高對華之援助、與更多之貸款、第一、爲發展中國西部之工業、第一爲穩定中國之法幣、第三、爲加强中國之軍事機構、在居氏尙未返美之前、即有此有等建　、雖似未免言之過早、但居氏抵華盛頓後、必將使美國加速援助中國經消與軍事上之需要、則可斷言、</p>
<p>能給予者數量甚多</p>
<p>居氏之意見、已在具演辭中申述無遺、蓋在中美文化協會及重慶哈佛同學會招待居氏時、居氏曾發表演說曰、「中國所要求者甚少、而美所能給予者甚多、余深信吾人決不致使諸君失望」、美國決不使中國失望、實屬毫無疑問、羅斯福總統曾迭次保證美國將援助在各處抵抗侵略之國家、使其能繼續與極權國家作戰、而問題之所在、爲此等堅決作戰之國家、其最需要者爲何物、此居禮博士與台斯德爾斯君奉命來華調查、原因也、</p>
<p>不容稍緩立卽發動</p>
<p>吾人希望美國對華之援助、旣已調查之後、即應刻不容緩、立即發動、日本戰艦已在南太平洋作危害之行動、若其企圖建立所謂「大東亞共榮圈」之野心未除、則南太平洋將有掀起烽火之可能、故美國亟宜乘此日本尙在觀望歐洲發展之際、立即將各種必需品運至中國、吾則如候至日海軍完成封鎖亞洲大陸之全部海岸綫、則爲時將太晚矣、美國援助中國之需要、實易事耳、蓋花如居禮博十所言、中國所需求者、固有限也、</p>

<p>謂此事乃游擊隊所爲、但無人受傷、的費七小時、始恢復正常交通、據華人方面消息、該地雷意在轟炸載客專車一列、該車載有高級日軍官、前往杭州出席重要軍事會議云、本市日軍當局則否認此說、據稱、並未在杭州舉行</p>
<p>軍事會議</p>
<p>且短期內不擬舉行此會議、日方相信地雷係一二人所埋、因該區游擊隊爲數不多也云、貨車出軌、確係因地雷爆發所致、此點已由日軍當局查明、聞貨車係駛近嘉興與嘉善間七星橋時、（距上海的五十哩）地雷爆炸、致機頭與貨車五節出軌、嘉興日軍得訊、馳往出事地點調查、但未能查獲埋雷人、按去年十一月二十九日、蘇州附近曾有客車一列觸雷傾覆、死傷頗衆、不久、又有滬寗間貨車一列、亦在蘇州附近出軌、</p>

<h3>糧食　米市塲貼費復熾　大宗囤米仍不出樣</h3>
<p>洋米得市明平暗緊、尙未正式走入軌道、惟一般人以爲國際風雲緩和、定貨始終通暢、故日前惶恐局勢漸見和平、掮客有今明入市之說各色洋米迄未出樣、市上點綴者仍屬一般低次雜色之貨、聊爲應酬而已、塲中雖無違法、然塲外貼費之舉可見遍傳、據說有小絞現米每百包貼三百五十元至四百元之舉、此說雖未證實、然以市上低次米照限價售出而論、則高米貼價實屬可能、新交易在接洽中曾有數批、將成議者有粹米三月份八十元二千噸說、回籠貨已不似前日之堅持、昨開出一號西貢二月份九十九元、小絞二三月份九上一元半至八十九元半、二月份九十一元二角半至九十二元、碎米八十元、共計的有七八百噸、全市現米交易僅祇一號暹邏開出六百包餘、惟原包英華　合義報三月份期貨小絞開出九十一元半九十一元、建兀報九十元八十九元半、及裕隆開出叫月份敏黨、以每担計算開八十六元、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米因來源寥落、及洋米擯持、在各方暢銷之下、售價繼續上漲一元、開崑山斛見白粳百零八元半、次至百零六元、靑角斛見薄稻百零四元半、百零四元、次百零三元、原包悉乏貨無市、</p>
<p>糯米以一再飛漲價格轟足、去路轉懈、同時以不受限、故客販則都乘機湧出、於是在洋尖匿絕之際、但見糯米擁擠、供過於求、還貶元砠、香港特元開八十九兀、中關八十七元、</p>
<p>洋米昨日又有到貨、太古公司瓊州輪昨晨抵埠、由香港裝來洋米二千五百包、停靠法租界外灘起卸、（祖）</p>
<h3>廠粉平賣二天</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日洋粉已見軟化、蓋以華粉廠、暫時恢復供給本街平賣二天、是以洋粉需要頓减、且路貨十餘萬包、不日將到、人心莫小帶餒、上午交易擯持、鐘樓牌澳粉喊價　十六元二角、尙無相當受主、後市稍有做開價又鬆至二十六元、藍嘜花及金龍牌亦各鬆二三角不等、統市現粉交易不足萬包、</p>
<p>小麥　暗緊如故、蓋以國內外供源枯竭、偶有零星現貨、售主居奇不脫、喊價已達四十一元、但本廠限盤爲四十元、日廠限價爲三十七元、祗有少數點綴而已、</p>
<h3>金融　外匯平靜</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美滙暗市、徘徊中尙穩、蓋多數經營者有待時局之發展、惟利空流言仍熾、投機商於軟態中、忽來售出、故走勢轉平、半日美滙本月份成交價由五元五三一二五、達五六二五、迨至午刻止、爲狀甚呆、結果英美滙均平、計現貨美滙價五元五六二五英滙　辦士四二一八七五、午後週三無市、</p>
<p>英美均無變化</p>
<p>晨初以倫教大條、近遠期均平、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美滬等不動、美對英未更、對滬小　分、對法無市、中央掛牌各滙如舊銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士四二一八七五、美滙五元五六二五、俱與上日晚收價同、開後港電需要頗殷、計向華銀行結人二月份美滙爲五兀五三一二五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅亦平、此後利空消息頻傳、投機商一部份前來吐出、故潛勢走硬、二月份美滙回至五元五六二五、又三月份美滙五元五三一二五、亦多成交、午收止市面極感平穩、結果現貨及本月份美滙吿五元五六二五、先令三辦士四二一八七五、下月份美滙五元五三一二五、英滙三辦士四零六二五、午後週三無市、比隔昨價英美滙期現、均無榮辱、</p>
<p>香港匯市不動</p>
<p>香港二十六日（週三）電、今晨滙市開盤動盪不定、英美日各滙均無上落、申滙現貨降落一元、爲四百三十九元、九時四十分申滙現貨回升一元、爲四百四十元、十一時三十分吿平、各滙無變動、下午週三無市、</p>
<p>天津申匯略升</p>
<p>天津二十六日（週三）電、今晨滙市開盤吿平、倫敦及紐約電滙俱無榮辱、申滙升一角三分、爲九十元零七角五分、「聯鈔」暗盤微昂一角、爲七十八元九角、</p>
<h3>期貨稍見回好　現金狂落　一百餘元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤、市况堪稱堅穩、雖外滙平穩、兼利空流霄極多、人心未爲所動、一因上日午後撳低太速、致開盤不乏進戶一度於德孚大豐仁承永等搜購下、挺至六千三百〇五元、嗣以滙市利空消息傳來、恒記新豐永等滙票商脫售、曾撳至六千二百二十五元、後合盛成記等維持、迄收盤尙吿六千二百五十三元、比上日軋升三十三元、半日交易共一萬五六千兩、下午週三無市、塲外曾哄至六千三百十元、仍難久支最後六千二百七十元有售出者、掉期（二月轉人三月）賣方貼出價、在四十元左右、現金突在跌一百餘元、義元售予祥和五百兩、照期亦高四百四十元、後籌碼充斥、做小至加四百十元、最後加四百元無買戶、致首飾金掛小十元、至六百八十元、關金等均平、</p>
<p>千三百元出而復入</p>
<p>晨初以上日傍晚跌勢過猛、開盤買戶頗多、故價抬起、比上日做高三十元、爲六千二百五十元、開後走勢更佳、計德孚大豐仁承永合盛等力購、遂步上升、終告穿出六千三百元外、達六千三百零五元、時外滙亦微帶緊故也、但恒記新豐永見高粉拋、再因外滙轉平、其他各幫均塞、不支趨落、很達六千二百二十五元、後盤旋甚久、以成記合盛吃胃相當豐厚、被拉至六千二百六十元、結果尙吿六千二百五十三元、收盤比上日軋漲三十三元、收後聞塲外做開六千二百六十五元、下午週三無市、塲外價曾升至六千三百十元、有成交、不久即在退、最後六千二百七十元無買戶、金號本牌金亦見在落、終照期交價高的四百元、收進比售出低七八十元、現標金仍無價無市、</p>
<p>銀樓飾金掛小十元</p>
<p>銀樓飾令每兩兌出價、初未更動、正午低十元、計大同行改懸六百八十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進减低三十元云、</p>
<h3>外幣上卜平凡</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價盤旋緊張、英美金鎊各漲一元、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票於午後會高至十七元八角半、卒爲十七元七角半、比上日軋升一角三分、香港票略趨挺勢、日金票稍起回風、晚市爲一元七角六分、朝鮮票需要仍殷、晚市高至一元四角一分、</p>
<h3>證劵　公債漲力强　—外股趨勢見軟—</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市仍上漲甚勁、信孚繼續搜買、未見减退、連日在市吸收、爲力之雄可以想見、所以市上籌碼愈軋愈見枯竭、倘利多消息傳來、軋空勢所必至、因同業交易大都時出時進、不斷在市流通、而其祇進不出、大有竭澤而漁之勢、昨日午前信孚首先買進、開價丙種爲六十五元二角、同時因鴻大同順新華紛紛買進、價乃直錢上騰、至六元零五分高價收盤、當時賣出者爲同康恒康怡泰較多、但仍覺杯水車薪、於事無補、午收各債均漲八角至一元三角、午後上落較微互有漲跌、脚地仍甚堅强、默覜多頭方面顯有組織、前途殊難預測也、市價結果一律回漲八角至一元一角、成交的一百萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交大生第一廠五十股、價爲十九元正、</p>
<p>衆業股市極靜、殊無炸色之可言、賣方雖不急於謀售、趨勢似略帶軟、實業股與橡皮股成交俱稀、</p>
<p>倫敦二十五日（週二）電今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌仃市重歸平滯、英商股票上落參差、上海電車跌二先令六便士、價爲十二先令六便士、上海自來水A字股跌一鎊半、價爲十二鎊、保安保險股漲四鎊、價爲二十四鎊、古拉客林傍橡皮股升一便士半、價爲十五先令九便士、其餘不動、</p>
<h3>經濟叢譚</h3>
<p>— 馮柳堂</p>
<p>鐘表漏刻　（續）</p>
<p>漏刻之制，有銅壺，水稱，渴鳥，漏箭，時牌，契，之屬。銅壺以貯水，鳥以引注，稱以平其漏，箭以識其刻，牌以牙製，刻字塡金，自卯至酉，共有七方，以吿時於　。契有二，用木製，一曰放鼓，二曰止鼓，用於夜。舊時宮禁開鑰，爲卯正後一刻，盈八刻爲辰時，每時皆然，以至於酉。每屆一時，直官進牌奏時正，雞人引唱，擊鼓十五聲，午正則擊鼓一百五十聲。至昏夜雞唱，放鼓契出，發鼓擊鐘一百聲，然後下漏。每夜分爲五更，更分爲五點，更以擊鼓爲節，點以擊鐘爲節。以籌記更點之數，故曰更籌。每更初皆雞唱，轉點即移水稱，以至五更二點，止鼓契出。五更擊鐘一百聲，雞唱擊鼓，是謂攢點。至八刻後爲卯時正。以此循環報時，四時皆同。惟冬令水易凝結，滴漏失其用，有時乃濟以火，而張思訓製渾象儀中之漏刻，冬令遂以水銀代水也。</p>
<p>但一般均無漏刻之設備，只憑經騐，日間則看日影之推移，夜間僅憑更放之報道，未足爲記時之準則也。故大都聞雞鳴知天之將曉，見日沒知黃昏已近。普通欲知時刻，日間有陽光尙可辨別，雨天據經騐以推時刻。中國人不能確守時間，正爲向來報時之方法不精密；再則爲其工作時間太散漫，所謂「日出而作，日入而息，帝力於我何有哉！」因之看得時間不重，雖有愛惜分陰寸陰之說，但求其動，不在乎守。何况平日談時，亦不過「近嚮午了，」「朝飯時候了，」「快要近黃昏了，」「沒頓飯時候，」「半盅茶功夫，」「一班烟功夫，」睹如此類，對於時間的觀念太鬆泛，因之遲早之閒，並不爲奇。如今鐘表盛行，報時漸準，而一般工作，亦多有一定時刻，將來中國守時間之風氣，必可遂漸養成也。</p>
<p>因古時報時之法如是　疎漏，欲知其爲何時，的是難事，故有定寅時歌訣，以爲寅時一定，其他即可推算，實　時刻問題，如無其他計時可恃　法，仍不能用以相解決，姑錄其說，以見古時辨時之不易。</p>
<p>「正九五更三點徹，二八五更四點敲，三七平明是寅時，四六日出寅無別，五月日高三地，仲冬才到四更初，十月十二四更二，便是寅時君記切。」</p>
<p>正九者，即正九月也，謂正九兩月之寅時，同爲五更三點，至三兩月，平明即爲寅時也，餘可依此類推。然此聊備一說，今已無此需要矣。（完）</p>
<h3>紗花　為節約電力　紗將减工　收盤時投機紛起</h3>
<p>紗市續升、且漲風殊劇、此因人心良好、據市塲謠言、紗廠方面因减省電力起見、恐有减工之說、如果確實、紡織生產减少、無形抬高、於是掀起投機買風、市盤得此推動、乃逐步前進，二十支雙馬最高價爲一千三百六十四元、低價一千三百二十一元、午後漲勢愈激、至一千三百九十二元、中途在一千三百八十四元之間迥旋多時、成交甚繁　升、價爲一千四百〇一元、回小至一千三百九十三元、最後價爲一千四白元收盤、二十七日有紗八十件運小呂宋、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開局勢和緩、首盤價爲一千三百三十　元、微升至一千三白三十五元、此時多頭稍有吐出、跌至一千三百二十一元、旋聞余價趨升、買氣濃烈、又復漲至一千三百五十四元、塲內忽起不利多頭空氣、忽然下挫至一千三百三十一元、在三十八九元之間往返甚久、迨至收盤時買風驟熾、謂紗廠有减工說、忽然上漲至一千三百六十四元收盤、查半日間成交統計七千八百五十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>現棉情况稍昂、但不及紗市之鋒利、此因紗廠如果减工、原料需要較少，不過人心尙佳、</p>
<p>紐約棉市市况靜而不定、又　空頭抵補、及華爾街有力、而突趨漲勢、結果較之上日收盤價格挺進二至九磅因不等、印棉甚平、昨日連向預測並無漲落、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、市况似又　靜寂之態、昨日市塲上因聞電力公司减電、紗廠减工等種種關係、故現紗雖一再猛漲、然原棉之買賣、竟乏人過問、</p>
<h3>疋頭　廠盤提高　同業居奇</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市晨疲午堅、趨勢堅挺、乃緣廠盤逐步提高、同業心思交易增加、廠方開出當貴細布價四十二元、富貴斜紋價三十七元、共三百餘件、以數量太寡、同業居奇、後市賣開細布四十三元二角牛、斜紋三十七元五角、各布　盤晨市平平、午後漲　細布每疋五角至七角半、粗布斜紋漂染布漲五角之譜、本街成交各布五白餘件、浙路溫甬幫辦色布漂布。細布一百餘件、閩粤幫辦漂染各布一百數十件、二十七日疋頭運新加坡一百件、運小呂宋一百二十五件、</p>
<p>東布　先疲後堅、結果細布每疋續漲五六角、十二磅龍頭晨開四十六元一二角、一度降至四十五元一角、後市因紗價升騰、市氣堅挺、買戶紛至、抬高至四十七元五角半、嗶嘰仍　十元三角、</p>
<p>海立斯銷路暢達</p>
<p>海立斯呢、邇來市銷頗暢、服裝幫大小各號、咸有相當進胃、因春季大衣、仍多風行　料、男女色衣着、均見盛行、英製品及本廠貨、咸有走銷、昨英製單幅眞海立斯呢、每碼齊買四十元左右、普通雙幅則售三十三五元、仁立天馬圖售十八元、美綸聖誕老人爲十二元、</p>
<h3>油餅　油荳餅市俱疲</h3>
<p>昨日油餅黃豆、均呈疲軟、黃豆南洋各幫雖有問津、但在到存兩厚之下、仍少奮發力量油餅明雖取締期貨買賣、然現貨交易、範圍狹小、不若投機大來大往、獲利爽快、故暗中交易尙難制止、惟昨日塲面上則不乏了結手續、豆油有漢口油運來糾脚、或將遭受打擊、花生油亦見平平、豆餅前途、有南洋去路之斷續關係、故暫時醞釀、尙難明朗、各種成交市價、均詳市價欄、</p>
<p>二十七日豆子出口、運新加坡二千九百　十包、運小呂宋　百三十五包、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價續跌</h3>
<p>昨糖市依然下跌、公會劃　、現貨二四粗白外棧初略好爲八十元、後仍回至七十九元八角、荷赤六十元八角、小四角、太古車白B嘜西棧七十九元至七十九元一角、東棧七十八化半、DY嘜西棧七十八元二角、HX嘜初爲七十七元半、後步鬆至七十七元、七十六元八角、七十六元半、期粗白三月十日打單八十元、二十日打軍八十元半至零二角、又糖昨由香港運來三百包、</p>
<h3>煤炭　同得利煤價昂觀望</h3>
<p>同得利白煤、前週自大批運到後、而本客店囤各戶、連日暢辦甚濃、昨以納胃大部充足、乃嫌價昂觀望、大盤雖尙擯持二百四十五元高價、老單暗市、兩百叫十元、亦有塞出、脫貨求現、本街鬥莊、篩塊每噸二百五十六元、送　在內云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　麒菜步漲</h3>
<p>麒菜近以軋缺、再度上展、昨市行盤冲獅毛菜七十四元至七十二元、西蘭菜七十元至六十八元、龍牙菜六十五元至六十元、武墩菜六十　元、市象仍堅、</p>
<h3>絲茶　紅綠茶來源湧旺</h3>
<p>近數日來、浙省紅綠茶、來源漸旺、蓋浙省當局近來對於不合收購茶葉、業經解禁、據茶行家消息、新近又由溫州。石浦等處運到之紅綠茶、爲數不下　千担、惟水脚奇昂、每公担均需法幣二百二十元、成本異常甚鉅、至國外銷胃、　德莊對於紅茶、略有談論貨價、查出口茶葉今日有三百五十件運往新加坡、</p>

<p>敎育</p>
<h3>受敎育和守秩序</h3>
<p>— 田徑</p>
<p>平日常聽到一些鍍過金的敎授們說，外國人是怎樣怎樣守秩序，而咱們的國度裏到處都是一團糟。何以會有這樣的差別呢？據說是因為人民敎育程度低落的緣故。</p>
<p>其實，受了敎育，即使是高深的敎育，也不見得就會守秩序。因為敎育似乎祇管「知」，而守秩序却是「行」的事。「知」了不去「行」，敎育不也還是白搭。</p>
<p>比方說吧，咱學校裏有個圖書館，但裏面的吵鬧聲並不比茶室遜色一分。東一堆人在「談天」，西一夥人在「說地」，而這邊又有三五位小姐話家常。（倘使有誰提出抗議，說我譭謗女人的令譽，那我可沒有那份膽子，因為事實上圍着火爐撩天的，確以小姐為多；這真不幸得很。不過，在圖書館裏大吃花生米的則多半是男士之流。）</p>
<p>圖書館的規則大學生不會不知道吧？可是，不僅我們學校的圖書館如此，上海的大學裏十個有九個是如此。你說這又該怎麽解釋？</p>
<p>有些公共圖書館——那里的閱覽者以連中學也沒進過的小職員為多，却靜得很。這樣受敎育和守秩守不又好像並不相關嗎？</p>
<p>如果受敎育永遠是和做人行事不相干的另一回事，那敎育受不受也沒關係；其實，還是乾脆不受的好。而所謂敎育這玩意兒也該到墳墓裏去憇憇了。</p>
<p>人物</p>
<h3>威爾基夫婦趣事</h3>
<p>— 志</p>
<p>美國共和黨大選前候選人威爾基，最近有來華考察之說，引起中國各界的注意。關於他的事跡，記載不多，這裏讓我來談一談他和他夫人的軼事。</p>
<p>威爾基雖然出身商人，但很具有政治家的手腕，所以為一般人所擁護。他對於政治生活的熱狂，簡直有廢寢忘餐的樣子。照例一個政治家的夫人，也必和他丈夫一般，到處去出風頭，如羅斯福總統夫人愛倫諾女士一般，她的大名簡直可駕總統而上之，但是威爾基夫人溫苔兒（Wendell）女士，却是一們典型的賢妻良母，和他的丈夫的性格大相逕庭。</p>
<p>溫苔兒是一個典型的美國婦人，年青活潑，有一對棕色的眼球，微帶褐色的秀髪，態度優雅而大方，愛好藝術歌舞，可是她不好交際，尤其不歡喜公開漏臉，所以大家都不認得她。</p>
<p>去年秋天，當威爾基和羅斯福競選總統，大家發表演說，互肆抨擊的時候，美國人民對於兩人鹿死誰手都很感興趣。有一天，有一位成衣匠替溫苔兒量身材，知道她姓威爾基，但只當她是平常人罷了，因此問她道：「威爾基這傢伙你認識嗎？」這句話倘給別的愛好虛榮的女子聽了，豈不要咆哮起來：斥他有眼不識泰山？那知她却淡淡地答道：「稍微，他是我的丈夫罷了。」那成衣匠聽了大吃一驚。</p>
<p>溫苔兒女士並非不懂得政治，她常和丈夫私下討論政治問題，但不願公開演講。人家問她何以如此，她便答道：「無論如何，當總統候選人的是我丈夫，不是我呀。」所以當威爾基出發全國作競選演說的時候，夫人「隨駕出征」，　以處理他的飲食，留心他的睡眠為限，不作公開的幫忙。</p>
<p>有一次威爾基行抵某處，數百個仰慕他的人，都排着隊伍，挨次和他握手致敬，這時有一位漂亮的婦人也雜在人叢中間，她和他握手的時候，嘴裏也和別人一般說着，「嗄，密斯脫威爾基，久仰久仰。」威爾基倒也沒有注意，照樣微笑和她握手，但定睛一看，這人不是別人，原來就是自己的妻子。</p>
<p>美國總統大選，以獲得紐約州選民的擁護與否，為重要的勝負關鍵。有一次，威爾基在紐約州的審判廳發表重要演說，聽眾擠得水洩不通，溫苔兒遲到一步，不得其門而入。她原可以通報自己的大名，獲得一位極好的坐位，然而她不願出此，寗可回到家裏，從無綫電收音機裏，聽取她丈夫的演講。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（四）意外的遇合</p>
<p>一陣酒往心頭一湧，玉崑不覺把什麽都忘記了，嘴裏才說得一聲「你這個傢伙不講理！」立刻便把手一揚，在沈麻子的左頰上用力摑了一下，趟四慌得馬上跳上去想阻擋，沒有來得及。</p>
<p>沈麻子冷不防吃了虧，那裏就肯干休，覷正玉崑右耳，猛可就是一拳送過去，但無論他怎樣快，也快不過玉崑，他的攻勢才發動，那個瘦小又靈便的身影已竄到門外去了。</p>
<p>「入你娘的！往那裏走？」沈麻子睜圓了一雙密佈紅筋的怪眼，一抬腿踢開了前面的一張櫈子，便像瘋虎似的趕出去。</p>
<p>秋海棠是知道玉崑的底細的，要講打架，他準不會吃虧，心裏也想借他敎訓沈麻子一次，便站在屋子裏，一聲也不響。</p>
<p>「啊！這事情不好！」趙四氣喘如牛地說：「你快把趙老板勸住了吧！常言說得好，强龍不敵地頭蛇，往後天津這個碼頭，咱們不能再來嗎？」</p>
<p>「我們二哥喝醉了酒是不認人的，要勸還是你去勸吧！」</p>
<p>正當趙四奔出房門，一路大喊：「有話好講，大家不要打」的時候，已聽得震大價的撲通一聲，接着又是玉崑的聲音，高喊了一聲「哎呀」，下面的人聲便嚷成了一片。</p>
<p>現在玉崑的酒也嚇醒了！他真沒有想到那個外貌很精壯的沈麻子，會這樣沒有用，自己只輕輕絆了一腿，就會從扶梯上一真翻下去的。</p>
<p>「血！血！血！」樓下幾個值夜的茶房，和好些尚未安睡的客人，頓時便一齊擁了出來，圍着暈死在花磚地上的沈麻子亂叫。</p>
<p>秋海棠站在趙玉崑的後面，從三十多級高的扶梯口望下來，湊着電燈光，可以很清楚地看見方才那個出言不遜的沈麻子，像一頭死狗似的躺在地上，鮮血正從他的後腦邊淌出來；僅僅這麽一瞥，已使他混身像害寒熱病一樣的抖起來了。（四一）</p>
<p>家庭</p>
<h3>父親有小妻</h3>
<p>— 草</p>
<p>父親有小妻。她是一個會咒詛的女人，年紀不算青，但總沒資格做我的娘。她來以後，家中就鬧得不亦樂乎，分成二派：我，老祖母，二弟一派；她，父親，還有一個娘姨一派；明爭暗鬥，各爭利權。試想一個家庭有了這種現象，還會弄得好嗎？</p>
<p>麻雀牌聲整日在父親的房間中價響，鬧得人沒有一刻的安靜，更不要想讀書寫作了。</p>
<p>老祖母已經七十多了，她花了的眼睛還要替我們兄弟倆縫補衣服。真的，除了她還會有什麽人來當心我們的衣服呢？本來她到了這一把年紀，也應該享福了，但是現在她反而得到煩惱，為了她的兩個孫兒。</p>
<p>母親實在太懦弱了，被父親遺棄了這許多年，居然還會再在鄉下同小弟二人安靜地過着受苦的生活。</p>
<p>每天深晚，我想起她們，我總默祝着她們的幸福與康健，可是淚又濕透枕頭了。</p>

<p>新片介紹</p>
<h3>「月宮寳盒」</h3>
<p>— 胡凡芳</p>
<p>「月宮寳盒」原是范朋克的傑作，但那是默片；現在亞歷山大戈達購得了故專的版權，經過二年的攝製，二百萬美金的投資，終於成就了道部不可一世的神話巨片。</p>
<p>「月宮寳盒」的故事，大家都知道採自「天方夜談」，而且讀過這故事的人一定很多，這裏似乎沒有再述一遍的必要；但爲了行文便利，不妨帶上幾筆。原來這是發生於古巴達城的一個熒麗的，而且幻想的故事，寫小賊阿菩怎樣幫助王子，粉碎一個頗懂妖法的奸相的陰謀，而和王子所一見鍾情的公主結婚。這裏面，有的是神奇的事蹟，美麗的景物，醉人心靈的仙境，以及驚心動魄的妖魔。飛行毯，騰空馬，神箭，盤絲洞，鎭仙瓶，天眼石，以及如廣吿上所說的呼風喚雨，移山倒海之類，眞個是洋洋大觀，目不暇接。對於這樣的影片，如果用尋常的看法去衡量，那是會牛頭不對馬嘴的。</p>
<p>因爲這里面的所有奇蹟，距現實不啻十萬八千里，我們要問的，不是可能不可能，而是像眞不像眞。那末，「月宮寳盒」的一切奇蹟，到底像眞不像眞呢？筆者有一句話可以說，自有五彩片以來，這部片子色彩的美麗置景的宏偉，是値得特別推崇的，那巍巍的巨宮，和宮裏炫奇瑰麗的置景，使人看了，眞有飄飄欲仙的感覺，尤其是公主出巡，和公主在池邊與王子情話等慕，艷麗眞不可方物。至於鎭仙瓶中放出巨魔，阿菩盜取夭眼石，妖魔作法，移山倒海，雖已極詭秘之大觀，盡神奇之能事，但這些全是攝影者的Camera　Trick美矣善矣，至矣盡矣，但還不是蔑以加矣；因爲像神馬騰空等，如果導演者更聰明一點，那末在畫面上所見到的，似乎還可以更美與更眞些。</p>
<p>全片演員，因故事的奇神詭秘與趣味豐富，每人演來都容易討好。演得最好的，應推演奸相的康拉維德，此公在英國頗有聲譽，中國觀衆也許還記得他，因爲他曾飾演過「拉斯蒲丁」；他把奸相的神態，刻劃得十分細緻，使觀衆見了，又恨父愛。其次才輪到領銜主演的薩菩，他的阿菩，就是當年范朋克所飾的角色，這一個巴達的竊賊，非常的機警與聰明，薩菩演米，也恰到好處，瓊杜白麗的公主美艷極了。的翰奧斯丁的王子也頗稱職。總而言之，這是一部百分之百的羅眼請吃冰忌淋的片子。</p>
<p>最後，請讓筆者再拖一個尾巴，彩色有聲片「月宮寳盒」，是沒有月宮而且也沒有賣盒的，因爲這個故事，已經改編過了，許多情節，都和默片不同，而月宮取賣盒一節，已易以阿菩在佛頂上盜取那顆通靈的天眼石。至於何以仍舊要用「月宮寳盒」這個片名，大概是爲了婦孺咸知吧！</p>

<h3>劇藝社承盤璇宮　合同簽定盤費交淸</h3>
<p>— 黑丁</p>
<p>是一九四〇年上海劇壇閃電般的變動！上海劇藝社和辣斐劇塲合作已有年餘，中間雖經過天時地理的不宜，却在劇藝社全體社員精誠團結下奮鬥過去了。「家」的獻演，無疑的爲本年度劇史留下了最光榮的一頁，六十餘塲的客滿，不僅予劇藝社以無限的經濟上和物質上的幫助，而且證明了他們二三年的苦鬥已爲上海戲劇奠定了穩固的基礎。然而「家」和辣斐所能保持的關係，僅一個月，因爲到二月底，劇藝社和辣斐的合同期滿了。所以觀衆向辣斐預定本星期日戲票的，都被婉言謝絕。</p>
<p>關於劇藝社與辣斐合同是否繼續這問題，很早以前便在商談，祇是沒有一個確切的決定。在這其間，別的戲院和劇藝社接洽的也很多，不過也祗是在談判中而已。然而，璇宮劇院派代表和上海劇藝此接洽却是不遠以前的事，進行是那樣的順利，憑着過去一度合作的關係，在雙方面誠懇的態度下，璇宮很願意將全部盤給劇藝社；於是讓盤的合同很快的簽訂了。從三月份起，璇宮的所有權便屬諸劇藝社。</p>
<p>以一個劇團據有一個戲院，這還是第一次。劇藝社打算把戲院內部大事改造一下，俾便合於演出話劇。並且爲了保證今後的發展，在劇目上和陣容將大事整頓·一九四一年的劇藝社將以嶄新的姿態和觀衆們見面了。</p>
<h3>中國廠攝　「禮葬大角」</h3>

<h3>US Senate Naval Affairs Committee Passes Funding for Fortifications on Pacific Islands, Totaling Over 200 Million Yuan; House Also Approves Appropriations for Coastal Installations</h3>
<p>WASHINGTON – The Senate Naval Affairs Committee unanimously passed yesterday a naval expansion bill totaling $242,373,500, which includes $4,700,000 for small-scale fortifications on Guam. When Senator Gillette, a Democrat from Iowa, was asked whether the Guam project would cause a reaction in the Far East, he reportedly said, "I cannot answer a single word." Rear Admiral Moreell, Chief of the Navy's Civil Engineers, testified that the Navy urgently needs the Kanoehe Bay seaplane base in Hawaii to alleviate overcrowding at the Ford Island air base. The Navy plans to station ten seaplane squadrons at Kanoehe Bay. He also stated that the Navy is rapidly constructing underground oil storage facilities in Hawaii, with tunnels reaching 300 feet underground. This bill was passed by the House of Representatives last week and sent to the Senate. It must be approved by the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, with a favorable recommendation, before being submitted to the Senate for debate. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>WASHINGTON – The House of Representatives passed a bill on the 19th of this month proposing an appropriation of $142,373,500 as funding for fortifications on US-owned islands in the Pacific, namely Guam and the Samoa Islands. The bill was immediately submitted to the Senate for discussion. The Senate Naval Affairs Committee submitted it for review this month and unanimously passed it. Rear Admiral Moreell defended the bill in a speech before the vote, stating that fortifications on Guam and the Samoa Islands are critical to American survival. He added that the bases recently ceded to the United States by Great Britain should also begin fortifications. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>WASHINGTON – Senator Walsh, Chairman of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, told reporters yesterday that the Guam and Samoa defense plan is essential to American national defense and its implementation is fully justified. He announced that the entire Naval Affairs Committee fully supports the fortifications on Guam (located south of Japan, only 1,500 miles from Japan) and Samoa. Rear Admiral Moreell, Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks, said he wants to turn Samoa into a large air force base. When a Senator asked Moreell if the Navy feels that Guam is strategically disadvantageous because it is located in the center of Japanese mandated territories, Moreell replied that American planes are currently flying to and from the Philippines and need Guam as an aviation station between Hawaii and the Philippines. He also said that the Navy plans to clear the coral reefs in the harbor within six months and tentatively plans to build a breakwater, which will take 18 months. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>WASHINGTON – The House of Representatives yesterday passed by a large majority an appropriation of $122,802,883 for the construction of coastal facilities, including $17,179,000 for the Hawaiian region. The total amount approved for coastal facilities this week has reached $365,000,000. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>WASHINGTON – The process of debating the Fourth Supplemental National Defense Appropriation Act was released today, showing that the United States is actively expanding its naval and land forces in the Philippines. Both the naval and land forces are prepared to continue expanding and improving coastal defense facilities that have not been touched for six years. Naval officials told the House Appropriations Committee that the Navy needs $1.6 million to build an ammunition depot in Mariveles, Philippines. This project was first considered in 1918. Regarding this matter, Chief Engineer Moreell said that the project could not proceed due to the uncertainty of the status of the Philippine Islands. The recent military position of the Philippines has made the Navy hopeful of building an ammunition depot there. The Navy has also requested $12,000 to improve the Cavite Naval Air Station in the Philippines and $100,000 to repair the Dewey dry dock at the Olongapo Naval Station. The Army has requested $500,000 to build hard-surfaced roads for the Philippine Army Air Station and station two new pursuit squadrons there, plus $185,000 for various construction projects for the Quartermaster Corps and $120,000 to improve the buildings and equipment at the Philippine Army Station. These defense expenditures for the Philippines will be requested in the same budget proposal as the Navy's request for $4.7 million to improve the harbor of Guam and $8.1 million to build air stations in Samoa and Tutuila. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Roosevelt and Congressional Leaders Discuss Amendments to Lend-Lease Act</p>
<p>WASHINGTON – President Roosevelt and congressional leaders discussed multiple amendments to the Lend-Lease Act yesterday, but when the President received reporters, he declined to release the details of the discussion, only stating that any amendments aimed at changing American policy of assisting Great Britain short of entering the war are clearly inappropriate. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>WASHINGTON – The Senate continued to debate the Lend-Lease Act heatedly yesterday. Senator Barbour, a Republican from New Jersey, said that the British fleet is the main shield for the defense of the Western Hemisphere. If the British fleet is seized or destroyed, it will make the unprepared United States bear the full responsibility for defending the Western Hemisphere. He argued that the United States should do everything possible to help Great Britain survive. Senator Murray, a Democrat from Montana, warned the Senate that if Hitler wins, free enterprise will end, and totalitarianism and socialism will occur. He also said that the Rome-Tokyo-Berlin Axis has threatened the United States from both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. If war breaks out in the Pacific, we must obtain the assistance of other friendly nations, just as we are currently planning to assist Great Britain, Greece, and China. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>WASHINGTON – President Roosevelt and several Democratic leaders announced yesterday after a lengthy discussion that they will do their best to get the Lend-Lease Act passed by the Senate on Saturday, regardless of any threats. They also said that they have decided to oppose any amendments that would weaken the President's power. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>INDIANAPOLIS – Republican leader Willkie said in a speech to the Indiana State Legislature yesterday that if the United States adopts an isolationist path, it will be contrary to the great spirit that created the United States and Indiana. No one can say that our way of life will survive forever. If we, as the nation leading free people, do not transcend old-fashioned political perspectives, we will cause the collapse of our own way of life. Although there are now five thousand miles of ocean separating us from Hitler's power, this is only temporary. Appeasers are enemies of society in this time of crisis. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>US Continues to Expand Scope of Embargo</h3>
<p>WASHINGTON – President Roosevelt issued a proclamation yesterday that, effective immediately, airplanes, electrodes, pencil lead, etc., are subject to export licensing. Effective March 10, belladonna and atropine (both poison names) and two other items will also require export licenses. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>LONDON – Minister of Commerce Lyttelton replied in the House of Commons yesterday afternoon to a question about British exports to Japan in the past twelve months, saying that no permits have been issued during the war for the shipment of automotive parts from Great Britain to Japan. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Australian Deputy Prime Minister Declares Readiness to Repel Invasion; Quadruple Alliance of Britain, US, Australia, and the Netherlands East Indies Can Deal Japan a Fatal Blow</h3>
<p>SYDNEY – Deputy Prime Minister Fadden stated yesterday that Australia's defense is fully completed and warned that if anyone moves further south, Australians will move further north. Fadden also said, "I do not want to be an alarmist, but war is moving so quickly that it would be foolish for the government not to be extremely prepared to protect Australia." (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>LONDON – Well-informed sources say that Japan is troubled by the increasingly tough attitude of Britain and the United States, and the active precautionary measures taken by the two countries. London sources believe that the Soviet Union can hardly remain neutral, but fully supports the strong attitude of Britain and the United States. The rumor that the Soviet Union and Japan will reach an agreement is a deliberately misleading propaganda to make Britain and the United States believe that Japanese commerce has obtained security guarantees. In short, everyone believes that no matter what the situation, the Soviet Union's policy towards China will remain unchanged. As for Matsuoka's mediation of the European war, it cannot be regarded as the disappearance of the Far Eastern crisis, because Japanese warships are patrolling in the Gulf of Thailand, and Japanese troops in Vietnam are controlling important entrances. As for Japan not asking Thailand and Vietnam to grant new rights as compensation for Japan's mediation of the Thailand-Vietnam dispute, it cannot be regarded as Japan's statement that it has given up its southward ambitions. On the contrary, Tokyo is waiting for Hitler to order the simultaneous launch of offensives in the West and the Far East. Therefore, the proposal for Japan to mediate the European war cannot stop Britain, the United States, Australia, and the Netherlands from jointly taking precautionary measures in the Pacific. In fact, the four countries in the Pacific have a closer cooperation. (25th dispatch)</p>
<p>CHONGQING – The Ta Kung Pao editorial advocates that Britain, the United States, Australia, and the Netherlands East Indies form a quadruple alliance in the Pacific, stating that the recently strengthened Pacific Fleet of the United States, with the use of Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand naval bases, can become a powerful enemy. The Netherlands East Indies has three cruisers, eight destroyers, one Australian squadron, eight mine-laying ships, and eight minesweepers. If the situation in the Mediterranean is favorable to Britain, part of the British fleet can be sent to the Far East. The Philippines has one hundred airfields, including two specially prepared military airfields. The Netherlands East Indies also has eleven airfields. Malaya has at least twenty. In the past eight years, the Netherlands East Indies has purchased a total of 1,800 aircraft. The combined air power of the four countries cannot be matched by Japan, because Japan does not have a strong air force. The naval and economic blockade of the four powers in the Pacific can deal Japan a fatal blow. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>Observers Speculate US-Japan Peace or War Issue Will Reach a Decisive Moment Within Three Months; Soviet Attitude is Particularly Critical</h3>
<p>NEW YORK – Experts believe that the issue of US-Japan peace or war will reach a decisive moment within ninety days. According to observers in Tokyo and Washington, it will depend on the attitude of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union holds a position of great importance in Asia, just as it does in Europe. What action Stalin will take is a mystery. The situation can be roughly analyzed as follows: The United States is eager for the Soviet Union to continue to be close to prevent the establishment of a Soviet-Japanese understanding. If this understanding is established, the fierce edge of the Japanese navy can be shifted towards the United States. The difficulty in US-Soviet rapprochement is the position of Great Britain. The Soviet Union insists that the United States must allow the Soviet Union to freely purchase unlimited goods as the price for being tough on Japan. If the United States agrees, the Soviet Union can sell its own raw materials such as cotton to Germany, and purchase its own needs from the United States. In this way, the British blockade will be ineffective. Therefore, the US "appeasement policy" towards the Soviet Union will inevitably be theoretical, and cannot be practical, because US policy is to ensure British victory, and it cannot take any action that would lead to the defeat of Britain. In addition, Washington will promote Soviet aid to China and prevent the establishment of Soviet-Japanese treaties, believing that Japan's first step is to not invade. Germany is trying to woo the two countries, and its efforts are extremely intense, with the aim of making its ally Japan worry-free. When Hitler launches a large-scale attack on the British Isles, the United States will be tied down by Japan in the Pacific. It is also very possible for Germany and the Soviet Union to jointly mediate the Sino-Japanese War. Japan only seeks not to lose face and is eager to resolve it. If Berlin's efforts to foster Japanese-Soviet friendship are successful, Hitler will gain another great diplomatic victory, which is as important as the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty. Analysts all admit the superior position of Xinjiang, equality of rights in all of China with Japan, and the perfectly seamless guarantee that Japan will not invade Asia.

<h3>US Plans to Place Greenland Under Protective Umbrella</h3>
<p>WASHINGTON – It is heard that the United States has adopted a "common sense" definition of the boundaries of the Western Hemisphere, listing Greenland, a vast territory of Denmark, within the scope of the Monroe Doctrine and under the protection of the US government. Qualified sources reveal that the President's concern is that it will advance south and control the Dutch East Indies, French Indochina, British Malaya, and Thailand. Tokyo has spread the news that the promotion of Soviet-Japanese friendship is in progress, with the intention of Japan eagerly obtaining Soviet assistance to end the war against China, and signing a Japanese-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty. Japan has already shown signs of making concessions to the Soviet Union, which can be seen in the one-year fishery agreement signed this time. Japan's move is to pave the way for the signing of a permanent fishery agreement and a commercial treaty. These two treaties are also to obtain Soviet goodwill and sign an agreement without recognizing Stalin as an onlooker watching from the sidelines, while doing everything possible to avoid war, putting party lines out of mind. He may wish to see his powerful potential enemy exhausted in the war, while Germany and Japan may also be seen by him as potential enemies. The Soviets have always regarded an independent and friendly China as a necessary condition for Soviet security. This is the main reason why the Soviet Union has continuously aided China. The Soviet Union is now demanding the highest price from Japan, and its major conditions include the restoration of the old Soviet rights in the North Sea, such as the Chinese Eastern Railway, etc. In the new policy decision-makers decide that the Western Hemisphere should be bounded by the 30th meridian west of Greenwich in the Atlantic Ocean and the 180th meridian west of Greenwich in the Pacific Ocean. This provision will place Greenland under the protection of the American Monroe Doctrine. (International News Service dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Grew Visited Matsuoka Yesterday</h3>
<p>TOKYO – US Ambassador to Japan Grew visited Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka today and had a ninety-minute conversation on general matters. (Associated Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Analysis of Matsuoka's Diplomacy</h3>
<p>When Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka answered questions in the Diet on the fourth of this month, he stated: "As long as it benefits Japan, two-sided, three-sided, or even multi-faceted diplomacy can be adopted." Judging from the recent diplomatic trends of Japan, Matsuoka is indeed trying the theory he has longed for.</p>
<p>Compared with his predecessors Arita, Nomura, and even Ugaki Hirota, Matsuoka is indeed more active. He does not cling to one belief like his predecessors, nor does he consider what consequences his speeches and steps will have. He speaks more rashly and engages in more rash maneuvering. However, as soon as he encounters major reactions and obstacles, he immediately turns around and adopts a different face and tone to deal with it. Therefore, even if people remove abstract terms such as "Establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and "Absolute Loyalty to the Tripartite Alliance," it is not easy to understand the true meaning of Matsuoka's diplomacy. However, everyone is familiar with his style. The so-called multi-faceted diplomacy is undoubtedly the true face of Matsuoka's diplomacy, although it does not seem to be very harmonious with the Tripartite Pact.</p>
<p>Since the Far East crisis suddenly became serious, Japan has shown an active posture in diplomacy: The Japanese military mission sent to Germany and Italy has already reached Germany, and the technical committee of the Tripartite Pact has also been formally established; for the Soviet Union, economic talks between the two countries began on the 17th, and it is urgently seeking the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty; for the units in Southeast Asia, on the one hand, it continues to carry out economic negotiations with the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam, and on the other hand, it is directing the cessation of hostilities and peace talks between Thailand and Vietnam; for the United States, in addition to trying to ease the American aversion and pressure with Nomura's assistance, it has repeatedly expressed Japan's "peaceful" intention; especially for the United Kingdom, on the 17th, Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu visited British Foreign Secretary Butler to explain the Japanese attitude and presented Matsuoka's so-called ceasefire proposal. On the 24th, British Prime Minister Churchill also summoned Shigemitsu for a meeting, handed over a British memorandum, and clarified the British basic attitude towards Japan. In addition to the above-mentioned contacts, Matsuoka has repeatedly made various diplomatic replies in the Diet, and especially the declaration on the 24th that Oceania should be given to Asians is the most stimulating to the world's attention. Such frivolousness and manipulation show an active diplomatic posture and adequately expose its lack of belief and sincerity, but only adopts a perfunctory attitude to deal with it in many ways. This is not only true for the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, but even for its close Axis allies; its recent diplomatic use of the United Kingdom, although it is his consistent means of use, deliberately shows that it has not completely entrusted all its future to the alliance relationship on the Axis side. This kind of diplomacy is neither innovative nor conservative, and can only be regarded as opportunistic expediency.</p>
<p>Observing such a multi-faceted relationship, it is not without a sense of urgency and importance: compared with Germany and Italy and the Soviet Union, it only hopes to maintain the existing alliance with the former and wait for future developments, while it is eagerly seeking to achieve something in diplomatic relations with the latter; between the United Kingdom and the United States, it only hopes to ease its aversion and pressure on the United States for a while, while it has major fantasies and even conspiracies about the United Kingdom. Originally, dividing the policies of the United Kingdom and the United States towards the Far East has been a consistent tradition of Japanese diplomacy in recent years, and it has not always failed to achieve temporary and local effects, especially in the two periods before the outbreak of the European war and after the defeat of France, but the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact ultimately promoted the realization of Anglo-American cooperation in the Far East; in the past five months, the United Kingdom and the United States have always adopted parallel policies, and the recent implementation of emergency facilities has opened a new era in the Far East crisis. However, although the positions of the United Kingdom and the United States are the same, their situations are very different. The United States has full freedom of use in the Western Pacific, while the United Kingdom cannot be unaffected by the European war, and in the actual strategic situation in the Far East, before the United States has completed its defense arrangements for the Western Pacific and most of its fleet has not crossed west of Hawaii, it still mainly relies on the British land and sea strength to support it. In addition, the remnants of appeasement in the United Kingdom still have considerable influence, and there are still illusions that Japan will separate from Germany and Italy. These situations are all factors that arouse Japanese fantasies, and also explain the recent frequent diplomatic contacts between the United Kingdom and Japan, and even the reason why Matsuoka has uniquely launched his peace offensive towards the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Churchill's statement when he met Shigemitsu that "British defense in the Far East is only of a self-defense nature and is not an offensive measure against Japan" may make people wonder whether it is a revival of the Chamberlain-Clerk policy line in the past; in fact, the increased defense of the Malay and Australian troops, the deployment of mines in the strait, and the previous actual war preparations are more than this diplomatic wording to express the British recent sincere attitude. It is certainly true that the British authorities do not want the war to spread to the Far East in order to deal with Germany wholeheartedly, but these are all relative and limited, because the United Kingdom has learned from its past mistakes and can believe that the British will not pay a heavy price for this. Moreover, the greatest decision-making power in the Far East issue lies with the United States. When the United States fully supports English, the British Far East policy will not be too far away from the United States, and at the same time, it can be seen that the plan to divide the Anglo-American formation in the Far East will never achieve any success. If Matsuoka's proposal to give Oceania to Asians is based on his fantasies about the United Kingdom and is proposed as an exchange condition, the Australian government has given a clear answer: "The more the Japanese advance south, the more the Australians advance north." And the future of Matsuoka's multi-faceted diplomacy will eventually only fade away with the advance and retreat of Japan.</p>

<h3>Japan Plots to Break the Thai-Vietnamese Impasse</h3>
<p>Tokyo. According to well-informed Japanese sources, Japan has proposed a compromise to break the deadlock in the Thai-Vietnamese negotiations. This proposal is Japan's final contribution to these negotiations. The land to be ceded to Thailand should historically belong to Thailand. A semi-official Japanese statement warned third countries not to interfere, lest the Tokyo peace conference end in failure, and stated that the Japanese government is closely monitoring everything. (26th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo. Japanese newspapers unanimously published the final plan for mediating the Thai-Vietnamese war. The summary of what was published in the Asahi Shimbun is as follows: (1) French Vietnam should return Ba Ke and Le Pu La Peng, which were ceded to France in 1904. (2) French Vietnam should return a part of the eastern Cambodian province ceded to France in 1907. (3) Return a part of the Lao province taken from Patrol in 1893. (26th United Press Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Konoe Answers Questions from Assemblymen</h3>
<p>Tokyo. Japanese Prime Minister Konoe today replied in writing to questions from Ozaki and 30 other assemblymen, stating that the current government is not pessimistic about the future diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States. The government firmly believes that if the path it is seeking is not wrong, there is no need to have any fears, so it is determined to make Britain and the United States understand Japan's true intentions. Although relations with Britain and the United States are extremely complex at present, if Japan explains to the two countries with a very clear attitude and facts, such as not seeking reparations or territory from China, it will not be difficult to gain their understanding. Also, in the question, there was an item: "Why did Konoe's great declaration on settling the China incident cause a bad reaction from China?" Konoe replied that this was due to Chongqing's counter-propaganda and the inability of the United States and Britain to understand Japan's true intentions. The question also criticized how the Japanese cabinet had changed four times since the Sino-Japanese War. Konoe replied that as long as the Emperor trusts me for one day, I will serve for one day.

<h3>The Yunnan-Burma Road is Open for Freight Transport</h3>
<p>Lashio. A Reuters reporter, accompanying ten transport trucks, traveled the Yunnan-Burma Road for ten days, finding that the road will never be cut off by aerial bombardment, unless the road is occupied by Japanese troops at some point. Transport between Burma and China will not be significantly disrupted. Chinese people have used their ingenuity to devise clever ferry systems, so that 100 fully loaded trucks can be ferried across the river every day. New roads are being built, and this method will soon be used to maximize the safe crossing of trucks without relying entirely on bridges. The construction of the ferry is very simple, simply placing planks on empty oil drums and connecting them with chains. A truck pulls it across the ocean. This is done entirely at night, and disassembled completely during the day to avoid Japanese bombing. Even if the ferry is occasionally damaged and unsuitable, another ferry can be set up to replace it without delay or effort. Therefore, if a bridge is damaged and cannot be used, this method can be used to eliminate the difficulty. The bombing damage to the bridges cannot cut off the road's traffic, and the road surface passing through the mountains is not affected by direct bombardment. The road is often in danger of landslides or flooding, so there are a large number of Chinese workers along the road. Any damage is repaired immediately, and it can be passable in a short time. In the past twelve months, including two seasons, the road's transportation has never been interrupted for more than fourteen hours due to natural obstacles. Once you see how easy it is to eliminate such natural obstacles, you will never believe that aerial bombardment can hinder the long and continuous transportation of the road.

<h3>The Balkan Situation is Evolving British Foreign Secretary Eden and Dill Suddenly Visit Ankara Close Military and Diplomatic Cooperation Expected to be the Main Topic of Discussion Germany Actively Prepares to Invade Bulgaria Sofia Filled with Tense Atmosphere</h3>
<p>London. Under German supervision, Bulgarian authorities are rapidly clearing major roads. Many believe that this obvious German preparation to occupy Bulgaria is difficult to reconcile with the recent speech by Bulgaria's new Minister of Agriculture. (26th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Sofia. Bulgarian newspapers reported yesterday that Bulgaria will have some kind of development in the near future, a development that will surprise the world and cannot be avoided. (26th Huitong Dispatch)</p>
<p>Sofia. Personnel from the German General Staff have taken over the entire town of Koria, which has 200 villas, located 44 miles from Sofia. (26th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Sofia. Although many believe that the Germans have made very detailed preparations to attack Greece through Bulgaria, observers in Sofia believe that the Germans may wait a few days, hoping for good news from the Italian army's operations in Albania. However, the weather is unfavorable to German actions. Repeated storms have made the roads unsuitable for heavy vehicle traffic, and although it is reported that the ice in the Danube River within Hungary has broken, the water level is still high. Sofia believes that the Germans will use the British threat to Bulgaria as an excuse to send troops through Bulgaria. If the Italian army can benefit in Albania without assistance, the Germans may not send troops through Bulgaria, because Greek diplomats stationed in the Balkan Peninsula have stated that Greece will never succumb to threats. Many believe that the resumption of normal traffic on the Romanian railway tomorrow is sufficient to show that German plans in Romania have now been completed. It is reported that several dive bombers have arrived in Romania from Germany. The German air force in Romania has reached about 650 aircraft. These aircraft can be used to assist land offensives. Sofia is still filled with a tense atmosphere of speculation. All cities and towns throughout the country are still summoning soldiers of all ranks to enlist, and Sofia has begun large-scale defense measures. The rumor that the authorities have drafted a joint declaration allowing German troops to occupy key points in Bulgarian territory has not been confirmed in Sofia. (26th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>British and German Forces Promote a Pro-Soviet Policy in Bulgaria</p>
<p>Vichy. According to news from the capitals of Bulgaria and Romania, a political conspiracy was recently uncovered in the Bulgarian capital. The leader of the conspiracy was a "pro-British" secret group, whose headquarters were located in Sofia. After the police authorities discovered it, they sent personnel to arrest many people, including several Macedonians. At the same time, there is considerable unrest in Bulgarian political circles. Many key political figures have met with King Boris to discuss the international situation. After hearing this news, political figures here believe that Bulgaria's internal affairs will soon have a direct impact on the situation in the Balkan Peninsula. Generally speaking, since Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German leader Hitler did not mention the Balkan issue in their recent speeches, and Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković visited Hungary, coupled with the establishment of a non-aggression treaty between Turkey and Bulgaria, the situation in Southeast Europe has tended to ease, which is worth noting. Since the end of the last World War, Bulgaria has consistently refused to participate in any political alliance or form an alliance with any country, large or small. But at this time, under pressure from Germany and Britain, although it does not approve of the Soviet system, it has had to promote a "pro-Soviet policy." This is an important element in today's Balkan situation. (25th Vahas Dispatch)</p>

<p>Khartoum. A large contingent of British troops is currently dividing into several routes to attack central Abyssinia, advancing deeper and deeper. It appears that the war in Abyssinia will accelerate, and the Italian army led by the Italian Governor of Abyssinia, Duke Aosta, is in a desperate situation everywhere. Currently, British troops are simultaneously breaking into Abyssinia from the south, northwest, and other sides in more than ten routes, and after the Abyssinians heard the news that the Abyssinian King had returned to his homeland, the number of people joining the patriotic Abyssinian army is increasing daily. The Italian regular army has been subjected to widespread attacks by British troops, and the number of deserters is increasing daily due to persuasion through leaflets and loudspeakers. In recent days, the British army's supply line through the mountainous area has become more and more perfect, and ammunition, medicine, and food have been transported in continuously. The British army's offensive power has greatly increased, and the strength of the British air force is also increasing daily. The British army is now reapplying the tactics of encircling the Italian army and cutting off its communication in places such as Keren in Eritrea, but in some places, the terrain is rugged and it is not convenient to quickly deploy mechanized troops. British infantry always climbs over mountains, destroys roads and bridges, and attacks the Italian army from behind. The Italian side, in addition to the outposts that are currently being withdrawn, its front line seems to start from Keren and attempts to defend Keren to the death. The Italian side is now using its elite white troops and winds south to Lake Tana, and then reaches Addis Ababa through 台勃拉 and 瑪柯斯. (26th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

Seated at the presiding table were Andreyev, Chairman of the Council of the Union, and Shvernik, Rasenkov, Yusupov, Chairman of the Council of Nationalities.

In terms of expenditure, national defense expenditure is 70,865,000,000 rubles, accounting for one-third of the total expenditure (an increase of 13.9 billion rubles compared to the previous year). (TASS dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Finance Minister's Report: In the joint session of the Council of the Union and the Council of Nationalities in Moscow last night, Soviet People's Commissar of Finance Zverev delivered a report stating, "During the three years of the Third Five-Year Plan, investment in socialist construction exceeded 45 billion rubles. During this period, the economic and military strength of the Soviet Union has been enhanced, and the Soviet Union's territory has also been expanded. The Soviet Union now has 16 strong constituent republics. The Soviet government strongly requests the Congress to approve the budget, with an estimated revenue of 216,200,000,000 rubles and an expenditure of 215,400,000,000 rubles. In other words, the revenue exceeds the expenditure by 788 million rubles. The estimated federal revenue is 170,200,000,000 rubles, and the revenue of the republics and local areas is 46,000,000,000 rubles, an increase of 21.4% compared to 1940. The increase in revenue is due to the increase in industrial output. The sources of revenue include 124,500,000,000 rubles from national and cooperative organization turnover tax, 31,251,000,000 rubles from profit tax, 9,998,000,000 rubles from the state social security fund, 2,603,000,000 rubles from tractor station revenue, 3,230,000,000 rubles from state loans, and 12,451,000,000 rubles from other taxes collected from the public."</p>
<p>The Increase in Tax Revenue: is a natural result of the increase in socialist production and trade. In 1941, the Soviet Union's industrial output will reach 162,000,000,000 rubles, an increase of 17% to 18% compared to 1940. The total retail sales volume will also increase from 174,500,000,000 rubles to 197,000,000,000 rubles. As for the income from national bonds and bank savings, 60 million people purchased the Third Five-Year Plan bonds in 1940, totaling 9,433,000,000 rubles. In 1940, the government issued 900,000,000 rubles in bond interest, a significant increase compared to the 550,000,000 rubles in 1939. Bank deposits have also increased, currently reaching 70 billion rubles.</p>
<p>In terms of expenditure, the following has been stipulated: 72,875,000,000 rubles for the national economy, an increase of 27.6%, including 139,181,000,000 rubles for the industrial sector (an increase of 41.1%), 13,455,000,000 rubles for the agricultural sector (an increase of 10.6%), 6,576,000,000 rubles for the transportation sector (an increase of 4.1%), 47,803,000,000 rubles for the social and cultural sector (an increase of 14.6%), and 70,865,000,000 rubles for the People's Commissariat of National Defense and Navy of the Soviet Union, an increase of 26.3%. In addition, 57 billion rubles have also been stipulated for major construction expenditures in 1941.</p>
<p>Agricultural investment will reach 13.5 billion rubles, with 387 new tractor stations planned in the Baltic republics. Regarding social and cultural expenditures, the main part is the support for various schools, universities, and specialized schools. In 1941-1942, the number of students in primary and secondary schools will reach 36.2 million, with 9.5 billion rubles allocated for primary and secondary schools (8.7 billion rubles in 1940), 2.299 billion rubles for higher education institutions, and 1,551,000,000 rubles for specialized schools.</p>
<p>The 1941 budget, in terms of various republics, has been stipulated as follows: 24,833,000,000 rubles for the Russian Federal Republic, 8,220,000,000 rubles for Ukraine, 2,110,000,000 rubles for Belarus, 144.8 million rubles for the Karelian Republic, 162 million rubles for Georgia, 51.8 million rubles for Armenia, 53.1 million rubles for Turkmenistan, 1,604,000,000 rubles for Uzbekistan, 51.8 million rubles for Tajikistan, 49.3 million rubles for the Komi Republic, 447 million for Moldavia, 80.1 million for Lithuania, 894 million rubles for Latvia, and 511 million for Estonia, totaling 46,000,000,000 rubles.</p>
<p>In terms of budgetary expenditure in various republics, 21.2% is for the national economy sector, and 66.8% is for social and cultural undertakings. Regarding the budgets of new republics such as Karelia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia, the main part is expenditure on economic and cultural development. Lithuania plans to use 86 million rubles to develop and restore industry, and another 260.5 million rubles will be invested in major construction. The expenditure for agricultural development is estimated at 65 million rubles. The major construction expenditure for Latvia is 300 million rubles, and for Estonia, it is 241 million rubles. In addition, cultural institutions in the new republics will increase, and medical institutions will also be added.

<p>National Defense Expenditure</p>
<p>During the joint session of the Soviet Supreme Council in Moscow last night, Finance Minister Zverev, when referring to national defense expenditure, stated, "The Soviet Union pursues a policy of peace, but will never ignore developments outside its borders. The current dire international situation has forced our country to adopt various methods to enhance the national defense capabilities of our socialist motherland. The Soviet government proposes that the Presidium of the Supreme Council immediately approve the national defense budget of 70,900,000,000 rubles." After Zverev finished speaking, everyone stood up and cheered for Stalin for a long time. This fully demonstrated the unshakable will of Soviet patriotism and the Soviet people, and their determination to continue to strengthen national defense.</p>
<p>Zverev continued, "The Soviet national economy has a great deal of storage. We should make full use of this storage to increase income and the strength of the socialist country. Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and the great Stalin, we are advancing towards communism." Zverev's speech aroused great cheers, and everyone stood up and enthusiastically cheered "Long live Stalin," the organizer and promoter of socialist victory. The cheers included several languages ​​and lasted for several minutes, shaking the Kremlin. (TASS dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Full Text of Hitler's Speech</h3>
<p>German Economic Policy</p>
<p>We should adhere to an economic policy that benefits the German nation. The government's economic policy should be based on the interests of the entire people and should not be built on a capitalist foundation. The people must have a day of awakening, so any country that implements a capitalist economic policy will inevitably face financial collapse as a result. After the victory of this war, the gold standard will gradually lose its effectiveness. In the future, people will no longer conduct their business through banks, but will be replaced by barter and clearing systems. Germany is a major factor in production and consumption, so other nations will voluntarily engage in commerce with Germany, regardless of the attitude of the banks. I have never asked the United States or other countries to lend gold, because we do not need gold. Let them keep their gold. However, our country's economic policy will never be like what bankers in New York or London say, and fall into depression. To know that Germany's economic policy is solely based on the interests of the entire nation as the sole premise. I have repeatedly made suggestions to Britain and France, but Britain and France have always ignored them and regarded them as ridiculous and absurd. From this, we can see that it is necessary</p>
<p>Forced to Resort to War</p>
<p>Recently, a certain American general declared in the US House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee that Churchill had stated to him in 1936 that Germany was becoming increasingly strong and Britain must find a way to destroy it. Since then, Churchill has been preparing to destroy Germany. At that time, I warned him, but a certain political party in Britain, instigated by Jews, was single-mindedly in need of war. It was hopeless to save. So I implemented arming the whole country. You all know that once I say something, I will definitely carry it out. Now it has been a great success. The achievements of military preparations in a few years can be proud of globally. Today, the German people are united, and the people and the party and army are united in spirit, defending the country together. Therefore, to say that Germany will repeat the defeat of 1918 is nothing more than foolishness. Our country's enemies once said that Germany would have a revolution within six weeks of the outbreak of the war, but they did not specify which German generals would lead this revolution. Germany does not have revolutionary elements. Britain and the United States do. They are willing to set up their headquarters in countries far away from the battlefield. I really don’t know who will lead the revolution in Germany, and I don’t know how the revolution will happen. But one thing I know is that there are some fools in Germany, but they will never launch a revolution. The enemy also said that Germany would succumb to winter, but Germany has now survived this winter. I don’t know what the enemy thinks. I believe that it will be the enemy countries, not our country, that will experience famine. I dare to say that the enemy's hopes are all fantasies.</p>
<p>Holding the Belief of Victory</p>
<p>I am honored to have experienced this vigorous war. The time has come for Germany to exert its power. I am waiting for the opportunity to lead millions of troops to attack the enemy and defeat them in one fell swoop. The German National Socialist Party will witness 1941 as the year of decisive battle. This is the firm belief held by all our party members. We believe in the justice of the world. We believe that years of hard struggle will surely lead to victory. Now there is one thing I want to announce to you all, that is, I am not afraid when I look at the enemy. I know that every political leader of the enemy represents the interests of their own class. Those who support them are either Jews or money. I know that the people of the enemy will be the executors of the will of our country's people. I firmly believe that after this war, God will bless the German nation again.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, when I first stepped into this tavern, I had no fame or great achievements. The ambition I had at that time was to create a new world in these twenty-one years. I dare to say that the road our party comrades will take in the future will be much easier than the road they have traveled in the past twenty-one years. Today, Germany will move forward bravely and continue to move forward. After Hitler finished speaking, all the old party members shouted the slogan "Forward" and dispersed.

<h3>While Japan Watches the Southward Advance, the United States Should Step Up Aid to China; the US President's Representative Has Suggested Three Items, But They Must Be Utilized in a Timely Manner and Expedited; Local Western Newspapers Expound on the Gains and Losses of Immediate Action</h3>
<p>The editorial of the Continental Daily News stated, "Dr. Currie, the personal representative of US President Roosevelt, and Mr. Tydings, an American economist, came to China to investigate how to assist the Chongqing government. Now, as they are about to return to the United States, if anyone hopes that these two will return home and accelerate US aid to China, then this kind of hope is very reasonable. These two distinguished guests have closely studied the wartime situation in China and what is needed to achieve success. They will soon fly back to the United States to report the results of their investigation to the White House."</p>
<p>Suggest Increasing Aid to China</p>
<p>According to reports in Chongqing newspapers, Dr. Currie has maintained close contact with Washington since arriving in Chongqing. It is said that Dr. Currie even suggested to President Roosevelt to increase aid to China and provide more loans: first, to develop industry in western China; second, to stabilize China's legal tender; and third, to strengthen China's military institutions. Although these suggestions seem to be made too early before Mr. Currie returns to the United States, it can be asserted that Mr. Currie will accelerate American aid to China's economic and military needs after arriving in Washington.</p>
<p>The Quantity That Can Be Given Is Very Large</p>
<p>Mr. Currie's views have been stated without reservation in his speeches. At the reception hosted by the Sino-American Cultural Association and the Chongqing Harvard Alumni Association, Mr. Currie gave a speech saying, "China asks for very little, and the United States can give very much. I firmly believe that we will never let you down." There is no doubt that the United States will not let China down. President Roosevelt has repeatedly assured that the United States will help countries resisting aggression everywhere so that they can continue to fight against totalitarian countries. The question is, what are the most needed things for these countries that are fighting resolutely? This is the reason why Dr. Currie and Mr. Tydings were ordered to come to China to investigate.</p>
<p>Immediate Action Cannot Be Delayed</p>
<p>We hope that after the investigation of American aid to China has been completed, it should be launched immediately without delay. Japanese warships are already taking harmful actions in the South Pacific. If their ambition to establish the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" is not eliminated, then the South Pacific may have the possibility of igniting the flames of war. Therefore, the United States should take advantage of this opportunity while Japan is still watching the development of Europe and immediately transport all kinds of necessities to China. It would be too late if we waited until the Japanese navy had completed the blockade of the entire coastline of the Asian continent. The need for American aid to China is really easy. As Dr. Currie said, what China needs is limited.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador to Arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong Next Week</h3>
<p>Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, and his wife, after residing in Chongqing for a long time, flew to Hong Kong the day before yesterday (25th). It is reported that they will take a ship from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Upon inquiry with the British Embassy Office, it was learned that the Ambassador arrived in Hong Kong yesterday and will stay in Hong Kong for several days. We have not yet received any telegrams regarding which ship he will take to Shanghai. However, it is believed that if the Ambassador comes to Shanghai, the date will be next week. It is also learned that after the British Ambassador comes to Shanghai this time, he will stay in Shanghai for several months if the situation does not change.</p>
<h3>Savings Bonds Reach 10 Million Yuan, Bank Deposits Rebound</h3>
<p>According to recent news from financial circles, Shanghai residents have purchased savings bonds for national reconstruction, which has reached a total of 10 million yuan. Since the Pacific war clouds have spread and the speculative market has been constantly turbulent, those who used to compete to buy foreign currency and were fascinated by speculation have been awakened. They all feel that the best guarantee for funds is to rely on the motherland. It is reported that ordinary deposits and savings deposits in various banks in Shanghai, whether official or commercial, have seen a sharp increase. This not only shows that the people's confidence in the legal tender is becoming more firm, but also shows signs that the escaped funds are returning. It is generally predicted that the savings for national reconstruction movement will be widely expanded in the future, and guiding the city's floating capital to develop the mainland industry can also enter the practical stage.</p>
<h3>Signing to Comfort Britain Movement, All Circles Respond Enthusiastically, This Move Further Strengthens the Alliance Between China and Britain to Strive Together to Defend Freedom and Justice</h3>
<p>China was the first to launch an offensive against aggression and fought against Japan. Under the leadership of wise leaders, relying on the vastness of human and material resources and the concentration of will and spirit, China laid the foundation for final victory. However, the assistance and support given to China by friendly countries in material and spiritual aspects have undoubtedly given China great help and encouragement, which the Chinese people deeply appreciate and will never forget. Now, the friendly country of China, Britain, also shares the same goal as China and is fighting to the death against the aggressor countries. This is what the Chinese people express sympathy and admiration for, and feel that there should be a kind of expression to convey friendship to friends in need, and further increase the close relationship between the two major anti-aggression nations of the East and West. Therefore, local Chinese figures in Shanghai initiated a movement to sign and comfort Britain, drafted a telegram to comfort British Prime Minister Churchill, and submitted it to the Sino-American Daily to publish and entrusted the newspaper to plan and carry it out. Now, the newspaper has received a response from the majority of readers, stipulated methods, officially implemented it, and widely promoted it. Schools, shops, factories, companies, and public groups have responded to this movement. It is hoped that those who agree will enthusiastically sign their names (please use a brush and black ink to write on domestic paper) and send them to the newspaper for collection. The newspaper will hire famous calligraphers to carefully write the telegram of condolences, and list all the names of those who agree, mount them into a hand scroll, and properly send it to the British government for safekeeping. This move will surely give the British government and the public a great spiritual warmth, and further strengthen the good relationship between the two countries, jointly seek to achieve the goal of defending freedom and democracy, and build a truly peaceful world. Moreover, national diplomacy is also unfolding here, with profound significance. The opportunity is convenient and easy. There is no better opportunity than this. It is also learned that after the launch of this movement, Reuters News Agency in Shanghai has sent a telegram to report to London.</p>
<h3>Colonel Hampson Left Shanghai Yesterday to Return to England and Rejoin the Military; More Than 200 American Evacuees; the President Pierce to Arrive in Shanghai on August 8</h3>

It is not possible to predict when it will return to Shanghai. Another O'Hara warship is also patrolling the Oujiang River. The city also has the Guam gunboat, which is stationed at the naval floating dock in the Yangjingbang.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Authorities Acknowledge that Shanghai-Hangzhou Freight Train Was Bombed; Locomotive and Five Freight Cars Derail; Rumor Is That the Bombing Was Aimed at High-Ranking Japanese Military Officers</h3>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post stated that according to passenger claims, at 7:45 a.m. yesterday (25th), a freight train encountered a landmine explosion near Jiaxing, causing the locomotive and five freight cars to derail. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway traffic was cut off for seven hours. The Japanese military authorities in Shanghai today (26th)</p>
<p>Admit to the Incident</p>
<p>Said that the incident was caused by guerrillas, but no one was injured. It took seven hours to restore normal traffic. According to Chinese sources, the landmine was intended to bomb a passenger train carrying high-ranking Japanese military officers to Hangzhou to attend an important military conference. The Japanese military authorities in Shanghai denied this statement, claiming that there was no</p>
<p>Military Conference Held in Hangzhou</p>
<p>And there are no plans to hold this conference in the short term. The Japanese believe that the landmine was planted by one or two people, because there are not many guerrillas in the area. It is said that the derailment of the freight car was indeed caused by a landmine explosion. This point has been verified by the Japanese military authorities. It is said that the freight car was approaching the Qixing Bridge between Jiaxing and Jiashan (50 miles from Shanghai) when the landmine exploded, causing the locomotive and five freight cars to derail. The Japanese army in Jiaxing rushed to the scene of the accident to investigate, but failed to capture the person who planted the mine. On November 29 last year, a passenger train near Suzhou overturned after hitting a mine, causing many casualties. Soon after, a freight train between Shanghai and Nanjing also derailed near Suzhou.</p>

It is reported that Lin Xiongji shot and wounded the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, K. Okazaki, and two Japanese officials of the Council at the ratepayers' meeting on January 23rd.</p>
<h3>The Establishment of the Huxi Special Police is Temporarily Difficult; Problems Exist with Personnel and Funding; The Final Decision Will Require Considerable Time</h3>
<p>The "Special Police Headquarters" for the western district, originally scheduled to be established on March 1st, has been unable to materialize as planned due to the ongoing negotiations between Pan Zhijie and Chrisler. The underlying issues are not widely understood. However, yesterday, the Japanese "Continental News" revealed that the problems lie in personnel and funding. According to the report, "The 'Special Police Headquarters,' originally scheduled to be formally established on March 1st, has been unable to make a final decision due to the need for careful consideration of personnel selection for each district headquarters after continued detailed discussions between Pan Da (i.e., Pan Zhijie) and Chrisler. Therefore, it is difficult to establish on March 1st. It is said that the reason for the delay is largely due to personnel issues and, concerning funding, difficulties arise in receiving the same treatment as the Shanghai Municipal Council. Therefore, the final decision may require considerable time."</p>
<h3>Repeated Obstruction of Japanese Troops; Hongkou Plunged into Chaos; Huang Xiong Shot in Caojiadu</h3>
<p>The "China Press" reports that yesterday (the 25th) afternoon, near Qiqihar Road and Pingliang Road in eastern Shanghai, two Chinese men shot and killed Japanese soldier Masakazu Takeda and seriously wounded Corporal Ishii. Japanese sentries stationed nearby heard the gunshots and rushed to pursue the perpetrators, eventually capturing one of the assailants in front of Huishan Park. The other assailant escaped. Afterwards, the Japanese side took strict precautions and conducted a thorough search.</p>
<h3>Inland Students Vigorously Serve the Country Amidst Hardship; Male Students Economize on Food and Clothing, Wear Broken Socks and Shoes; Female Students Eager to Enlist, Travel Long Distances</h3>
<p>Dr. Zhu Youyu, the assistant bishop of the American Church, recently arrived in Shanghai from the southwest inland. The day before yesterday, at a luncheon hosted by the American United Universities Association at the American General Association, Dr. Zhu first spoke about his personal experiences traveling by road. Dr. Zhu compared Chinese roads with western American roads. He traveled at 90 kilometers per hour on Chinese roads. He witnessed that initially, the car drivers on the roads were unskilled in driving and experienced various unfortunate incidents. However, the Chinese authorities</p>
<p>Are Urgently Seeking Remedies</p>
<p>They established stations along the roads, allowing drivers to obtain good food and lodging, reducing unfortunate incidents and increasing work efficiency with remarkable results. These drivers came from various parts of the Far East, speaking English, Dutch, and Cantonese. Another important point, and perhaps the most important that can be reported, is that Dr. Zhu spoke about the situation of students in inland universities and middle schools. It is said that the morale in the inland is high, which can be seen in the students. Inland students live extremely hard lives, lacking instruments and food. A few students even lack shoes and socks, economizing on food and clothing, which is no different from beggars on the streets of Shanghai. Dr. Zhu also said that a group of female students, numbering four hundred, eagerly wished to participate in the</p>
<p>Madame Chiang Kai-Shek's</p>
<p>Training class, traveling for two months before arriving in Chongqing. When they arrived, a few of these female students had already broken their shoes and were barefoot. Each female student, after strict training, graduated from the program and was sent to the coastal areas to participate in various tasks. They greatly assist the military.</p>
<p>The Strictness of the Search is Rarely Seen</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, at 8 PM yesterday, a team of Japanese Naval Landing Force soldiers conducted a search in the alley at the intersection of Weituoma Road and Yangzhou Road. Suddenly, a Chinese man drew a gun and fired two shots at a Japanese soldier in the team, missing him. The remaining Japanese soldiers immediately returned fire, firing several shots, but the shooter escaped. The Japanese authorities tightened restrictions on vehicles and pedestrians in Hongkou, and implemented unprecedentedly thorough searches of Chinese residents, causing the situation in Hongkou to descend into chaos again. It is reported that, other than Pingliang Road, the intersection of Qiqihar Road, the area near Pingliang Road, Qiwupu Road, Yangzhou Road, and Huacheng Road, the remaining roads in the Hongkou district were only reopened to vehicles and pedestrians late last night. After the shooting on Weituoma Road last night, Japanese Naval Landing Force soldiers set up guard posts around the area and strictly searched pedestrians, buses, and rickshaw passengers, but did not find the shooter. Subsequently, one Chinese man and three women were arrested on suspicion. The searches yesterday afternoon and evening were not limited to Chinese residents; even foreigners and Japanese residents were searched. The Japanese authorities also dispatched numerous Naval Landing Force soldiers to search for armed suspects in Hongkou and Yangshupu.</p>
<p>Two Japanese Officers Were Severely Wounded</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Shanghai Times reported that the Japanese soldier Masakazu Takeda, who was shot and killed, and Corporal Ishii, who was wounded, both belonged to the medical team. One of the arrested assailants was also wounded by a bullet and sent to a nearby hospital, where he remained unconscious late into last night. As for the details of the sniper attack on a Japanese naval officer at the intersection of Weituoma Road and Yangzhou Road last night, details are unknown. It is rumored that the officer was suddenly shot twice by a Chinese man and was seriously wounded. The Japanese authorities refused to disclose the officer's name and whether he was injured yesterday, but it is widely believed that the officer has now been sent to a nearby hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Huang Xiong was Shot in the Abdomen</p>
<p>Furthermore, at 8:30 PM yesterday, "City Police Bureau Official" Huang Xiong (transliteration) left his residence in Xiangshou Lane, Caojiadu. Suddenly, a Chinese man blocked his path, ordering him to stop. Huang Xiong thought he had encountered a robber, but the man unexpectedly pulled out a handgun and fired. Huang Xiong was shot in the abdomen and collapsed to the ground. The shooter escaped. Huang Xiong was rushed to the hospital, and his life is in danger. It is said that this case was politically motivated. Furthermore, the English Evening Star reported that the Japanese naval authorities here officially acknowledged the claim that a Japanese naval officer was sniped at on Weituoma Road last night. It is said that they have thoroughly investigated the reported location of the shooting on the road, but found no evidence to confirm the claim. One of the assailants who shot at the Japanese soldier on Pingliang Road yesterday afternoon and was arrested was interrogated by the Japanese military authorities today. Japanese Corporal Ishii, who was shot in the chest, is now being treated in a Japanese military hospital and is expected to fully recover. The remaining details are unknown.</p>
<h3>Xin Puyu Hall Eagerly Awaits Continued Donations from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Recently, the Xin Puyu Hall has been facing imminent financial difficulties, appealing to all sectors and philanthropists for donations. Many have enthusiastically contributed, achieving good results. However, the goal is still far away. We earnestly request continued donations from all sectors. The donations received yesterday are listed as follows: Lizhi [school name] donated 58 yuan on behalf of the third-grade classmates, Yu Chenghao 50 yuan, Wang Shaner 50 yuan, Lizhiying [school name] donated 28 yuan and 10 cents on behalf of the first-grade classmates, Fang Zhengyi 10 yuan, Zheng Junyi 10 yuan, Pu Qiting 10 yuan, Xiangtai Timber Company Wang Lin 10 yuan, Tao Kaiquan 5 yuan, Liu Hong 4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Sold at a Flat Price for One Day; Stockpiled Rice Shows Slight Market Response</h3>
<p>Regarding the flat-price sale of flour, as a result of prior negotiations between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Fuxin and Fufeng factories, since January 3rd, Fuxin has supplied 9,873 bags per day, and Fufeng has supplied 1,059 bags (excluding Sundays), totaling 6,932 bags, priced at 23 yuan per bag at the factory, plus a handling fee of 3 jiao for the flour dealers. The above supply amount, for six days a week, totals 41,592 bags, only enough to meet the needs of users for five days (daily flour demand is 8,318 bags). Therefore, it is stipulated that users can only collect flour for five days a week. It has been learned that due to the suspension of work at the Fuxin factory, the supply of flour has been stopped since last Tuesday (February 18th). Therefore, the supply amount has become even more scarce. Hence, since the same day, the sale of flat-price flour has been temporarily suspended. On the other hand, the flour issued by the Fufeng factory every day has been gradually accumulated. It has now accumulated 8,318 bags, enough to meet the needs of users for one day. It is scheduled to be sold in full tomorrow (28th). Users can go to the original flour dealer to collect flour, which will still be sold for 23 yuan and 3 jiao per bag. It is also learned that yesterday (February 26th), 8,318 bags of imported flour were sold in one day. As of tomorrow, it is estimated that there will be a surplus of 13 bags of Fufeng Lao Chepai flour and 657 bags of imported flour. After accumulating a certain amount in the future, they will be distributed on a scheduled basis. On the other hand, the Bureau has negotiated with the Fuxin factory, requesting it to find ways to produce flour from the remaining raw materials as soon as possible to meet the urgent needs of the market.</p>
<p>The Rice Market Order Gradually Stabilizes; After the Bean, Rice, and Coarse Grain Industry Association took emergency measures, although the rice market situation has not seen extremely great development, it has improved slightly compared to a few days ago. The market has seen stockpiled goods responding to the market, and sales are all within the price limits set on the 3rd of this month. The market order has also gradually stabilized. However, large organizations generally find it difficult to change their ways, which is difficult to understand. The two associations also announced to the market yesterday that from March 1st, applications to join the rice market for business operations will be temporarily suspended. The Rice and Grain Brokers Association announced that the current rice price has reached the top of the limit. Under this situation, the only task of our association members is to advise each holder of goods to freely sell their stored rice within the price limit. Those who exceed the price limit and privately trade will be responsible for their own punishment. Our association will not protect them. The Food Cooperative Association stipulates the method for rickshaw pullers to collect tips for delivering rice: (1) For delivery downstairs at Xinlou, 1 jiao per bag will be given. (2) For delivery upstairs, 2 jiao per bag will be given.</p>
<h3>After the Dissolution of the Islamic Relief Association, There is No New Organization</h3>
<p>Shanghai City's Muslim believers number over 100,000, with over a dozen mosques. After the outbreak of the war, zealous believers organized the Islamic Disaster Relief Association to relieve displaced believers. After the association officially announced its dissolution last year, there has been no organization of any kind. Currently, reports indicate that Li Wangshu and others are initiating the organization of a certain association. The reporter visited many Muslim friends, who all expressed their disapproval of the organization.</p>
<h3>A True Record of the European War</h3>
<p>Since the publication of the "A True Record of the European War" issued by this newspaper, within less than a month, sales have been booming, a miracle unseen in this year's domestic publishing industry. And in recent days, those coming to the newspaper to wholesale and retail purchases are still streaming in. There are numerous letters from Yu, Rong, Gui, Zhu, Dian, and the Nanyang area requesting wholesale. The purpose of this newspaper's publication of this book is to instill international knowledge and increase the interest of our readers. It is not comparable to general booksellers who only seek profit. Therefore, although the entire book has as many as tens of thousands of words and over two hundred pages, the selling price is slightly over two yuan. Wholesale from other places cannot be refused, but current traffic is blocked, delivery is difficult, and the post office refuses to accept books. Therefore, those requesting wholesale from other places cannot be accommodated for the time being. If the Shen Zhuang of bookstores in other places can bear the responsibility of transportation themselves, then this newspaper will also be happy to offer preferential discounts to supply the book industry's wholesale purchases. As for local readers, if you want to buy more or retail, please do so as soon as possible, because there are not many books in stock now, and only a little over a thousand copies are available for retail, which will soon be sold out. Currently, the prices of paper and ink are skyrocketing. In the future, the selling price of the reprint will inevitably be forced to increase to reduce losses.</p>
<h3>The American General Association Convenes a Special Meeting to Discuss the Issue of Moving Out of the Old Clubhouse; Someone is Willing to Purchase, Name Unknown</h3>
<p>Since the news of the Shanghai American General Association's auction of the clubhouse at 20 Yi Road, Fuzhou Road, was released, someone who did not want to announce their name has been willing to offer a price to purchase it. In order to consider this issue, the association has specifically scheduled a special meeting at 5:30 PM today. According to an employee of the association, it is impossible to find out who the willing buyer is. If the association really sells it, what plans will be made in the future can only be known after today's meeting. According to reliable sources, if the clubhouse on Fuzhou Road is purchased, the American General Association will definitely be able to obtain a new and suitable clubhouse.</p>
<h3>Changes in Rickshaw Puller Registration; More Than 10,000 People Unemployed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, since starting to exchange new licenses for public rickshaw pullers last month, has reached the deadline yesterday. The rickshaw pullers have also complied with the regulations and exchanged their licenses, but have not yet met the quota of 28,481 people. This is because some rickshaw pullers have left Shanghai due to business or have changed to other industries, resulting in many vacancies. It is planned to start new rickshaw puller registration from the 10th of next month. The rickshaw industry association of the Special District said that the Municipal Council's restrictions on rickshaw puller license exchange this time are harsh, requiring 20 shifts per month (an increase of 5 shifts), and limiting the registration of 3 people per rickshaw (a decrease of 1 person), resulting in more than 10,000 rickshaw pullers becoming unemployed in the past because they did not pull enough 20 shifts. Rickshaw owners have suffered parking losses due to the reduction in the number of rickshaw pullers. They have requested the Municipal Council to be lenient, but have not been granted permission. They plan to plead with the authorities again to change the method.</p>

<h3>A Bizarre Murder Occurred in the Carlton Apartment Yesterday Morning; An Indian Owner Jumped Off the Building and was Injured; A Servant was Stabbed to Death on the Spot</h3>
<p>A murder case occurred at Room 125 on the second floor of the Carlton Apartment at the corner of Kirk Road and Park Road in the Public Concession at around 7:00 AM yesterday. The victim was a servant named Wang Jinwan, who was stabbed in the head.</p>
<p>Died on the Spot</p>
<p>Room 125 on the second floor of the Carlton Apartment is rented by an Indian man named T. Ghatalta (24 years old). The Indian man works in a foreign firm in the Hamilton Building at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road. He hired Wang Jinwan (also known as Hui Jun, 37 years old) from Tongzhou as a servant. At around 7:00 AM yesterday, two men resembling people of a certain country suddenly broke in,</p>
<p>Intending to Murder</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Indian man was sleeping in the inner room. Wang was sleeping on the floor in the outer room. Wang suddenly heard footsteps on the floor. He was sleepy, only wearing underwear, and got up to ask who was visiting. Unexpectedly, before he could finish speaking, he was suddenly stabbed in the head with a sharp blade by the thugs, and a hole was pierced in his right forehead. His skull burst, and he died on the spot. The corpse was lying across the floor, a tragic sight. The Indian man in the room heard the alarm and hurriedly put on his clothes and got up, regardless of everything. He opened the window and</p>
<p>Jumped Down</p>

The corpse in Room 125 was transported by car to the Maijiang Hospital, then transferred to the morgue to await examination by the court. It is reported that the deceased has a younger brother who is also a servant in a certain room in the apartment.</p>
<p>A Reporter from the Pingming News Agency</p>
<p>Rushed to Investigate</p>
<p>At the time, according to the elevator driver and other servants of the apartment, no one was seen entering or leaving when the incident occurred. The above information is only one-sided information from the Indian man. There is no evidence to prove whether someone from a certain country broke in and committed the crime. Whether the Indian man is the murderer, who jumped off the building out of fear of punishment after the crime, using this as a smokescreen, or whether there are other reasons, the Indian man has been taken to the police station for strict interrogation. It is said that the case will soon be brought to light.</p>

The surgery was performed, but ultimately he succumbed to his serious injuries and excessive blood loss, and died at 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Qiu Xiangbiao was Executed for Killing His Good Friend After Showing Ingratitude</h3>
<p>Qiu Xiangbiao, a 24-year-old Ningbo native, and Lin Wei were not only from the same hometown, but also classmates. After graduating, they both worked as salesmen at a certain savings association and rented a house together at No. 16 Siwen Lane, Datong Road. Later, Qiu was dismissed due to his bad character, being addicted to gambling, and embezzling public funds, leaving him unemployed at home. Then, he privately pawned 150 yuan and a coat that Lin Wei entrusted him to collect, which led to verbal conflicts and a rift. Unexpectedly, Qiu had murderous intentions and secretly hid a kitchen knife. At around 7:00 AM on the 4th of this month, he sneaked into Lin's bedroom and slashed Lin repeatedly with a knife while Lin was sleeping soundly. He slashed no less than fifty times, causing Lin to be hacked to death on the spot, his face blurred, a tragic sight.

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Grain: Rice Market Fee Recovered; Large Stockpiles of Rice Still Not Sampled</h3>
<p>Imported rice has a clear and flat market, but it is tight in the dark, and it has not officially entered the track. However, the general public believes that the international situation has eased and orders are always smooth. Therefore, the panic situation a few days ago has gradually become peaceful. Brokers have said that they will enter the market today or tomorrow. All kinds of imported rice have not been sampled, and what is on the market are still ordinary, low-grade, and miscellaneous goods, just for entertainment. Although there is no violation of the law in the market, the practice of paying fees outside the market can be seen everywhere. It is said that there is a case of paying 350 yuan to 400 yuan for every 100 bags of small-sized current rice. Although this statement has not been verified, judging from the fact that low-grade rice on the market is sold at the limited price, it is indeed possible to pay a high price for high-grade rice. New transactions are in negotiation. There were several batches, and the one that will be approved is 2,000 tons of pure rice in March at 80 yuan. Goods that have been recalled are no longer as persistent as they were a few days ago. Yesterday, No. 1 Saigon opened at 99 yuan in February, and small-sized goods opened at 90 yuan and 1.5 fen to 89 yuan and 5 fen in February and March, 91 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen to 92 yuan in February, and 80 yuan for broken rice, totaling seven or eight hundred tons. The transaction volume of current rice in the city is only 600 bags of No. 1 Siam. However, the original English Hua Heyi reported that small-sized goods for March futures opened at 91 yuan and 5 fen and 91 yuan, Jianwu reported 90 yuan and 89 yuan and 5 fen, and Yulong opened the call for the June Mintang, which was calculated at 86 yuan per dan.</p>
<p>Due to the scarcity of sources and the holding of foreign rice, domestic rice such as thick and thin japonica rice has continued to rise by 1 yuan in price under the sales of various parties. Kaikunshan Hu saw white japonica rice for 108 yuan and 5 fen, then to 106 yuan, and Qingjiao Hu saw thin rice for 104 yuan and 5 fen, 104 yuan, then to 103 yuan. The original package is short of goods and there is no market.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice has been booming due to repeated soaring prices, and its demand has turned lazy. At the same time, because it is not restricted, dealers have taken the opportunity to pour out, so when foreign tips are nowhere to be found, they see glutinous rice crowded, with supply exceeding demand, and they also depreciate Yuan Yuan. Hong Kong's special yuan opened at 89 yuan and Zhongguan at 87 yuan.</p>
<p>Imported rice arrived again yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Qiongzhou ship arrived at the port yesterday morning and loaded 2,500 bags of imported rice from Hong Kong, which were unloaded at the Bund of the French Concession. (Zhu)</p>
<h3>Factory Flour Sold at Flat Price for Two Days</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, imported flour had already softened because the Chinese flour factory had temporarily resumed supplying the flat price for two days on this street, so the demand for imported flour has suddenly decreased, and more than 100,000 bags of land cargo will arrive in the near future. People's hearts are slightly discouraged. Transactions were held in the morning, and the price of Zhonglou brand Australian flour was called at 26 yuan and 2 jiao, but there was no suitable owner. The market was slightly open, and the price was relaxed to 26 yuan again. Blue Mark Flower and Golden Dragon brand were also loosened by 2 jiao and 3 jiao each. The transaction of existing flour in the city is less than 10,000 bags.</p>
<p>Wheat: The darkness is as tight as before because the supply of domestic and foreign sources is exhausted. Occasionally, there is sporadic existing cargo, and the sellers live in a strange place and do not get out. The asking price has reached 41 yuan, but the factory's limited price is 40 yuan, and the Japanese factory's limited price is 37 yuan. Only a few are embellishments.</p>
<h3>Finance - Foreign Exchange Calm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed prices, remained unchanged. The unofficial market for British and American currencies hovered steadily. Most operators are awaiting developments in the situation. However, negative rumors continued to spread. Speculators, amidst the softness, suddenly sold off, so the trend turned flat. In the morning session, the transaction price for the current month's US dollar reached $5.5625 from $5.53125, and by noon, the situation was very stagnant. As a result, both British and American currencies remained flat. The spot price for the US dollar was $5.5625, and the British pound was three shillings, four pence, two and one-eighth of a penny. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>British and American Currencies Unchanged</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's large bars, both near and far terms, were flat. New York silver prices remained flat. London gold remained stable. The exchange rates for British pounds against US dollars and Shanghai dollars were unchanged. The US dollar against the British pound did not change, and against the Shanghai dollar, it was slightly different by a fraction. There was no market for the French franc. The central bank's listed prices for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with a spot selling price of three shillings, four pence, two and one-eighth of a penny for the British pound, and $5.5625 for the US dollar, the same as the closing price of the previous evening. After the opening, Hong Kong Electric had a considerable need, settling the US dollar for February at $5.53125 with the Bank of China. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The silver equalization tax was also flat. After this, negative news spread frequently, and some speculators came to sell, so the potential became firmer. The February US dollar returned to $5.5625, and the March US dollar at $5.53125 also saw many transactions. By noon, the market felt extremely stable. As a result, the spot and current month's US dollar closed at $5.5625, three shillings, four pence, two and one-eighth of a penny. The next month's US dollar was $5.53125, and the British pound was three shillings, four pence, and one-sixteenth of a penny. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

<h3>Futures Slightly Recovered, Cash Plunged, More Than One Hundred Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash, in the unofficial market, could be described as quite stable. Although foreign exchange was stable, and there were many negative rumors, people were not moved. One reason was that the price had been pushed down too quickly in the afternoon of the previous day, resulting in a lack of buyers at the opening. Once, under the buying of De Fu, Da Feng, Ren Cheng, Yong, and others, it rose to $6,305. Later, due to the spread of negative news from the exchange market, remittance firms such as Heng Ji, Xin Feng, and Yong sold off, pushing it down to $6,225. After that, He Sheng, Cheng Ji, and others maintained the price, and it closed at $6,253, up $33 from the previous day. The half-day transaction volume was 15,600 taels. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. Outside the market, it was once speculated to $6,310, but it was difficult to maintain for long, and the last transaction was at $6,270. The swap (February to March) selling price was around $40. Cash suddenly fell by more than $100. Yi Yuan sold 500 taels to Xiang He, and the forward price was also $440 higher. Later, the chips were abundant, and it was reduced to $410. Finally, there were no buyers at $400, causing jewelry gold to be listed at a small $10 down to $680. Customs gold and others remained flat.</p>
<p>Thirteen Hundred Yuan Entered and Exited Again</p>
<p>In the early morning, due to the sharp decline in the evening of the previous day, there were many buyers at the opening, so the price was raised, $30 higher than the previous day, to $6,250. After the opening, the trend was even better. De Fu, Da Feng, Ren Cheng, Yong, He Sheng, and others bought strongly, and it gradually rose, finally breaking through $6,300, reaching $6,305. At that time, foreign exchange was also slightly tight. However, Heng Ji, Xin Feng, and Yong saw the high price and threw it out. Furthermore, because the foreign exchange turned flat, all other parties stopped, and it fell, reaching $6,225. After a long period of hovering, Cheng Ji and He Sheng had considerable buying, and it was pulled to $6,260. As a result, it still closed at $6,253, $33 higher than the previous day. After the close, it was heard that the outside market was doing business at $6,265. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. The outside market price once rose to $6,310, and there were transactions. Soon it retreated, and finally there were no buyers at $6,270. The gold shop's own brand gold also saw a decline, and the forward delivery price was $400 higher. The closing purchase was $70-80 lower than the sale. The current bid gold still had no price and no market.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Listed Ten Yuan Lower</p>
<p>The exchange price for jewelry gold per tael was initially unchanged. At noon, it was $10 lower. Da Tong Hang changed to list $680, and Xin Tong Hang was similar to the previous price. Purchases were reduced by $30, it was said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Slightly Fluctuating</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market was tense with volatile prices. British and American gold pounds each rose by one yuan. British gold notes remained stable. The market price remained flat. American gold notes once rose to $17.85 in the afternoon, but finally settled at $17.75, up one jiao and three fen from the previous day. Hong Kong notes showed a slightly upward trend. Japanese gold notes rebounded slightly, with the evening market at $1.76. Korean notes were still in high demand, with the evening market rising to $1.41.</p>
<h3>Securities - Government Bonds Strong, Foreign Stocks Trended Soft</h3>
<p>The unofficial market for government bonds continued to rise strongly yesterday. Xin Fu continued to buy, showing no signs of waning. It has been absorbing in the market for days, and its strength can be imagined. Therefore, the chips in the market are becoming increasingly exhausted. If positive news comes, a short squeeze is inevitable, because the transactions of fellow traders are mostly in and out from time to time, constantly circulating in the market, while they only buy in and do not sell out, which is a tactic of draining the pond to catch all the fish. Yesterday morning, Xin Fu took the lead in buying, opening the price for Class C at $65.20. At the same time, because Hong Da, Tong Shun, and Xin Hua also bought, the price rose straight to a high of $6.05 at the close. At that time, Tong Kang, Heng Kang, and Yi Tai sold more, but it still felt like a drop in the bucket, to no avail. At the noon close, various bonds rose by eight jiao to one yuan and three jiao. In the afternoon, the fluctuations were relatively small, with ups and downs, but the footing was still very strong. It can be seen that the bulls have a clear organization, and the future is difficult to predict. As a result, the market price all rebounded by eight jiao to one yuan and one jiao. The transaction volume was one million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: Fifty shares of Dasheng No. 1 Factory were traded at a price of $19.00.</p>
<p>The public stock market was extremely quiet, with nothing to offer. Although sellers were not eager to sell, the trend seemed slightly soft. Transactions in both industrial and rubber stocks were rare.</p>
<p>London, 25th (Tuesday) report: Today, the listing prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far Eastern British companies' stocks were mostly flat. British stocks fluctuated. Shanghai Tramway fell two shillings and six pence to twelve shillings and six pence. Shanghai Waterworks A shares fell one and a half pounds to twelve pounds. Bao An Insurance shares rose four pounds to twenty-four pounds. Gula Kelin Rubber shares rose one and a half pence to fifteen shillings and nine pence. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Economic Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Feng Liutang</p>
<p>Clepsydra Leaks (Continued)</p>
<p>The system of clepsydras includes copper pots, water balances, thirsty birds, leaking arrows, time tablets, and notches. The copper pot is for storing water, the bird is for drawing water, the balance is for leveling the leak, the arrow is for identifying the time, the tablet is made of ivory, the carved characters are filled with gold, from Mao to You, there are seven tablets to announce the time to the . There are two notches, made of wood, one is called "Release Drum" and the other is called "Stop Drum", used for the night. In the old days, the palace gates were opened one quarter after Mao Zheng (6:00 AM), and eight quarters were Chen Shi (8:00 AM). Every hour was like this until You Shi (6:00 PM). Every time an hour arrived, the official on duty presented the tablet and announced the correct time. The rooster-man led the singing and struck the drum fifteen times, and at noon Zheng (12:00 PM), the drum was struck one hundred and fifty times. At dusk, when the rooster crowed, the Release Drum notch was released, and the drum and bell were struck one hundred times, and then the clepsydra was started. Each night was divided into five watches, and each watch was divided into five points. The watch was marked by striking the drum, and the point was marked by striking the bell. The number of watches and points was recorded with chips, hence the name "watch chips". At the beginning of each watch, the rooster crowed, and when the point changed, the water balance was moved, until the second point of the fifth watch, the Stop Drum notch was released. In the fifth watch, the bell was struck one hundred times, and the rooster crowed and the drum was struck, which was called "assembling the points". After eight quarters, it was Mao Shi Zheng (6:00 AM). The time was announced in this cycle, and the four seasons were the same. However, in winter, the water was easy to freeze, and the dripping was ineffective. Sometimes fire was used to help, and Zhang Sixun made a clepsydra in his armillary sphere, and mercury was used instead of water in winter.</p>
<p>However, most people do not have clepsydra equipment, and only rely on experience. During the day, they look at the movement of the sun's shadow, and at night, they only rely on the report of the watchman, which is not accurate enough to mark the time. Therefore, most people know that the sky is about to dawn when they hear the rooster crow, and they know that dusk is approaching when they see the sun set. Ordinary people who want to know the time can distinguish it during the day when there is sunlight, and they use experience to infer the time on rainy days. The reason why Chinese people cannot keep time accurately is that the method of telling time has not been precise in the past. Furthermore, their working hours are too scattered, as the saying goes, "Work at sunrise, rest at sunset, what does the emperor's power have to do with me!" As a result, they do not value time. Although there is a saying that cherishes every minute and every inch of time, they only seek to move, not to keep. What's more, when talking about time on weekdays, they only say "It's almost noon," "It's time for breakfast," "It's almost dusk," "It's not time for a meal," "It's half a cup of tea's worth of work," "It's a pipe's worth of work," and so on. Their concept of time is too loose, so being early or late is not surprising. Now that clocks and watches are popular, and the time is gradually becoming more accurate, and most jobs have fixed times, the habit of keeping time in China will gradually develop in the future.</p>
<p>Because the method of telling time in ancient times was so negligent, it was difficult to know what time it was. Therefore, there is a mnemonic for fixing Yin Shi (3:00-5:00 AM), so that once Yin Shi is fixed, other times can be calculated. In fact, the time problem, if there is no other reliable method of timing, still cannot be used to solve it. Therefore, I will record its saying to show the difficulty of distinguishing time in ancient times.</p>
<p>"Zheng Jiu Wu Geng San Dian Che, Er Ba Wu Geng Si Dian Qiao, San Qi Ping Ming Shi Yin Shi, Si Liu Ri Chu Yin Wu Bie, Wu Yue Ri Gao San Di, Zhong Dong Cai Dao Si Geng Chu, Shi Yue Shi Er Si Geng Er, Bian Shi Yin Shi Jun Ji Qie."</p>
<p>Zheng Jiu means Zheng (January) and Jiu (September), which means that the Yin Shi of Zheng and Jiu months are both Wu Geng (4th watch) and three points. In the three and seven months, Ping Ming (dawn) is Yin Shi. The rest can be inferred in this way. However, this is just a saying for reference, and it is no longer needed now. (End)</p>
<h3>Yarn - Yarn Mills Reduce Labor to Save Electricity, Speculation Rises at Closing</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, and the price increase was particularly sharp. This was due to good sentiment. According to rumors in the market, yarn mills may reduce labor to save electricity. If true, textile production would decrease, which would invisibly raise prices, thus triggering speculative buying. The market was driven by this, and it gradually moved forward. The highest price for 20-count Double Horse was $1,364, and the lowest price was $1,321. In the afternoon, the rising momentum became more intense, reaching $1,392. The price hovered between $1,384 for a long time, with very active trading. The price rose to $1,401, then retreated slightly to $1,393. The final price closed at $1,400. On the 27th, 80 bales of yarn were shipped to Little Luzon.</p>
<p>The opening situation for Double Horse was moderate in the morning. The opening price was $1,330, rising slightly to $1,335. At this time, the bulls sold off slightly, falling to $1,321. Then, hearing that the remaining price was rising, the buying interest was strong, and it rose again to $1,354. An atmosphere unfavorable to the bulls suddenly arose in the market, and it suddenly fell to $1,331, fluctuating for a long time between $1,338 and $1,339. When the market closed, the buying interest suddenly increased, saying that yarn mills would reduce labor, and it suddenly rose to $1,364 at the close. According to the statistics of transactions in the half-day, 7,850 bales were traded. The amount bought by each party is listed as follows:</p>
<p>The spot cotton situation is slightly rising, but not as sharp as the yarn market. This is because if yarn mills reduce labor, the demand for raw materials will be less. However, the sentiment is still good.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market was quiet and erratic, and short covering and the strength of Wall Street suddenly drove the rise. As a result, the closing price was up two to nine pounds from the previous day. Indian cotton was very flat. Yesterday's forecast showed no gains or losses.</p>
<p>The Shanghai outer cotton trading market seemed to be in a state of silence again. Yesterday, due to various factors such as the power company's reduction of power and the yarn mill's reduction of labor, although spot yarn repeatedly rose sharply, the trading of raw cotton was rarely asked about.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods - Factory Prices Increased, Dealers Hoarded</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market was weak in the morning and firm in the afternoon, and the trend was firm. This was because factory prices gradually increased and dealers' interest in trading increased. The factory quoted a price of $42 for Dang Gui Fine Cloth, and $37 for Fugui Twill, with a total of more than 300 pieces. Because the quantity was too small, dealers hoarded. In the afternoon market, Fine Cloth was sold at $43.20, and Twill at $37.50. Various cloth prices in the morning market were flat. In the afternoon, Fine Cloth rose by five jiao to seven jiao and a half per piece, and Coarse Cloth, Twill, and Bleached Cloth rose by five jiao. More than 500 pieces of various cloths were traded in the street. The Zhejiang-Ningbo group handled colored cloth and bleached cloth. More than 100 pieces of Fine Cloth. The Fujian-Guangdong group handled one hundred and several dozens of pieces of bleached and dyed cloths. On the 27th, one hundred pieces of piece goods were shipped to Singapore and one hundred and twenty-five pieces were shipped to Little Luzon.</p>
<p>Dongbu Cloth was weak first and then firm. As a result, the price of Fine Cloth continued to rise by five or six jiao per piece. Twelve-pound Dragon Head opened at $46.12 in the morning, once falling to $45.10. In the afternoon market, due to the rising price of yarn, the market sentiment was firm, and buyers flocked in, raising the price to $47.55. Beji remained at $13.10.</p>
<p>Harris Sells Well</p>
<p>Harris tweed has been selling quite well in the market recently. Large and small clothing companies have considerable buying. Because spring coats are still popular materials, both men's and women's colored clothing are very popular. Both British products and local factory goods are selling well. Yesterday, British-made single-width genuine Harris tweed sold for about $40 per yard, and ordinary double-width tweed sold for $335. Renli Tianma map sold for $18, and Meilun Santa Claus sold for $12.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake - Soybean Cake Market Both Tired</h3>
<p>Yesterday, both oil cake and soybeans were weak. Although various Southern Ocean groups inquired about soybeans, they still showed little strength under the heavy storage. Although the oil cake futures trading will be banned, the scope of spot transactions is small, and it is not as profitable as speculative trading, which is large and fast, so secret transactions are still difficult to stop. However, there was no shortage of settlement procedures on the market yesterday. Hankou oil was shipped to correct the situation, or it may be hit. Peanut oil was also flat. The future of bean cake is related to the intermittent route to the Southern Ocean, so it is temporarily brewing and still difficult to clarify. The transaction market prices of various types are detailed in the market price column.</p>
<p>On the 27th, beans were exported, 2,910 bags were shipped to Singapore, and 335 bags were shipped to Little Luzon.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market - Sugar Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to fall. The association divided, spot two or four coarse white foreign stack was initially good at $80, but then returned to $79.80. Dutch red was $60.84. Taikoo Car White B Mark West Stack was $79 to $79.10, East Stack was $78.50. DY Mark West Stack was $78.20, HX Mark was initially $77.50, and then loosened to $77, $76.80, and $76.50. The three-month coarse white futures were $80 on the 10th, and $80.50 to $80.02 on the 20th. Also, 300 bags of sugar were shipped from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>
<h3>Coal - Tong Deli Coal Price High, Wait and See</h3>
<p>After a large batch of Tong Deli white coal was shipped in the previous week, the shops and households in this store have been busy with it for days. Yesterday, because most of the purchasing was sufficient, they were reluctant to buy at the high price and waited and see. Although the major dealer still maintained a high price of $245, the old order unofficial market was called $210, and there was also selling off to sell for cash. In the street competition, the screened lump was $256 per ton, including delivery.</p>
<h3>Dried and Fresh Goods - Qicai Steps Up</h3>
<p>Due to the shortage of Qicai recently, it has been re-displayed. Yesterday's market price for Chongshi hairy vegetables was $74 to $72, Xilan vegetables were $70 to $68, Longya vegetables were $65 to $60, and Wudun vegetables were $60. The market situation is still strong.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea - Red and Green Tea Sources Surge</h3>
<p>In recent days, the sources of red and green tea in Zhejiang Province have gradually become abundant. The Zhejiang authorities have recently lifted the ban on tea leaves that do not meet the purchase requirements. According to tea merchants, the red and green tea recently shipped from Wenzhou, Shipu, and other places is no less than thousands of dan. However, the water foot is extremely expensive, each gongdan costs 220 yuan in legal tender, and the cost is extremely high. As for foreign sales, the German firm has slightly discussed the price of black tea. It is reported that 350 pieces of tea leaves were shipped to Singapore for export today.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education - Actively Promotes Phonetic Symbols, Orders Provincial Education Bureaus to Handle Three Key Points</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) The Ministry of Education regards the transmission and practice of phonetic symbols as the primary task for eradicating illiteracy. In view of the fact that the methods of transmission and practice in the past mostly emphasized unified language and were overly precise in terms of standard intonation, it is difficult to find teachers and the training takes time. The Ministry believes that the main purpose of transmission and practice is to assist literacy, so it is necessary to strive for practicality and simplicity in order to facilitate promotion. It has issued a circular extracting relevant phonetic symbol teaching materials and bibliographies over the years, and instructing educational bureaus in all provinces and cities to comply. The key points are as follows: (1) The pronunciation and spelling of phonetic symbols added next to Chinese characters should not be mistaken to the extent that they are incorrect. As for the tone marks in the upper right corner, the teaching can be based on the local natural tones of the Chinese characters, and it is not necessary to teach according to the national standard tones. (2) When necessary, the local pronunciation method, which is very different from the national pronunciation on the right side of the phonetic Chinese characters, can be spelled and added on the left side of the phonetic Chinese characters, and read out according to the pronunciation to facilitate teaching. (3) The preliminary teaching methods of phonetic symbols are also divided into three categories according to the level of the students: 1. Ordinary primary schools use the method of first synthesis and then analysis. 2. Mass literacy classes use the method of combining synthesis and analysis. 3. Teacher training uses the method of first analysis and then synthesis.</p>

<h3>Sino-Western Table Tennis Cup; Thirty-Eight Teams Participate; Team Names for Four Groups Announced</h3>

The chess club is very strong, with players such as Cheng Shu-ming, Weng Zhi-chao, Hu Yi-ping, Mao Yong, and Yang Kai-yun. Chen Lin-sheng will also participate personally, giving the team great hope for the Group B title. To avoid suspicion, Chen Lin-sheng will voluntarily abstain from joining the team.

<h3>Being Educated and Obeying Order</h3>
<p>— Tianjing</p>
<p>We often hear gilded professors say that foreigners obey order, while our country is a mess. Why is there such a difference? It is said that it is because of the low level of education among the people.</p>
<p>In fact, being educated, even highly educated, does not necessarily mean obeying order. Because education seems to only concern "knowing," while obeying order is a matter of "doing." If one "knows" but does not "do," then education is still useless.</p>
<p>For example, there is a library in our school, but the noise inside is no less than that of a teahouse. One group of people is "chatting," another group is "talking about the world," and here are three or five young ladies having a casual conversation. (If anyone protests and says that I am slandering women, I would not dare, because in fact, most of those chatting around the stove are young ladies; this is really unfortunate. However, those eating peanuts in the library are mostly men.)</p>
<p>University students should know the rules of the library, right? However, not only is our school's library like this, but nine out of ten universities in Shanghai are like this. How do you explain this?</p>
<p>Some public libraries—where most of the readers are small clerks who have not even attended middle school—are very quiet. Doesn't this seem to indicate that being educated and obeying order are not related?</p>
<p>If being educated is always another matter that has nothing to do with one's conduct, then it doesn't matter whether one is educated or not; in fact, it is better not to be educated at all. And this so-called education should go to the grave to rest.</p>

<h3>Interesting Anecdotes About the Willkie Couple</h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>Wendell Willkie, a former candidate for the Republican nomination for president of the United States, has recently been said to be coming to China for inspection, which has attracted the attention of all sectors of Chinese society. There are not many records of his deeds, so let me talk about anecdotes about him and his wife.</p>
<p>Although Willkie came from a business background, he had the skills of a politician, so he was supported by the general public. His enthusiasm for political life was so great that he forgot to eat and sleep. As usual, a politician's wife must also be like her husband, going everywhere to show off, like Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt, whose name is almost above the president's. However, Mrs. Wendell Willkie is a typical virtuous wife and loving mother, and her personality is very different from her husband's.</p>
<p>Wendell is a typical American woman, young and lively, with a pair of brown eyes, slightly brown hair, elegant and generous demeanor, and a love of art, singing, and dancing. However, she does not like socializing, especially not liking to show her face in public, so everyone does not know her.</p>
<p>Last fall, when Willkie and Roosevelt were competing for president, everyone was giving speeches and attacking each other, and the American people were very interested in who would win. One day, a tailor was measuring Wendell for clothes, knowing that her last name was Willkie, but only thought she was an ordinary person, so he asked her, "Do you know this fellow Willkie?" If another woman who loves vanity heard this, wouldn't she roar and scold him for not knowing Mount Tai? However, she replied faintly, "Slightly, he is my husband." The tailor was shocked.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wendell does not lack for understanding of politics, and she often discusses political issues with her husband in private, but she is unwilling to give speeches in public. When people asked her why, she replied, "In any case, it is my husband who is the presidential candidate, not me." Therefore, when Willkie set off to make campaign speeches across the country, his wife "followed the imperial carriage," limiting herself to taking care of his diet and paying attention to his sleep, without helping publicly.</p>
<p>Once, when Willkie arrived somewhere, hundreds of people who admired him lined up to shake hands with him to pay their respects. At this time, a beautiful woman was also mixed in the crowd. When she shook hands with him, she said the same thing as others, "Ah, Mr. Willkie, I have heard of you for a long time." Willkie did not pay attention, and shook hands with her with a smile as usual, but when he looked closely, this person was none other than his own wife.</p>
<p>The American presidential election considers whether or not a candidate obtains the support of New York voters to be a critical factor in winning or losing. Once, Willkie gave an important speech in the courthouse of New York State, and the audience was packed. Wendell arrived late and could not enter. She could have announced her name and obtained an excellent seat, but she was unwilling to do so, preferring to return home and listen to her husband's speech on the radio.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(4) Unexpected Encounter</p>
<p>A rush of alcohol surged to Yu Kun's head, and he unknowingly forgot everything. He only managed to say, "You are being unreasonable!" before raising his hand and slapping Shen Mazi hard on the left cheek. Zhao Si panicked and immediately jumped up to try to stop him, but it was too late.</p>
<p>Shen Mazi, caught off guard, was not willing to let it go. He aimed at Yu Kun's right ear and delivered a punch. But no matter how fast he was, he could not match Yu Kun's speed. As soon as his attack was launched, the small and nimble figure had already darted out of the door.</p>
<p>"Damn you! Where are you going?" Shen Mazi widened his strange eyes covered with red veins, kicked away a stool in front of him, and chased out like a mad tiger.</p>
<p>Begonia knew Yu Kun's background. When it comes to fighting, he would not suffer a loss. She also wanted to take the opportunity to teach Shen Mazi a lesson, so she stood in the room and did not say a word.</p>
<p>"Ah! This is bad!" Zhao Si said, panting like a cow, "You should quickly persuade Boss Zhao! As the saying goes, a strong dragon cannot defeat a local snake. We can't come to Tianjin in the future?"</p>
<p>"When our second brother is drunk, he doesn't recognize anyone. You should go and persuade him!"</p>
<p>Just as Zhao Si ran out of the room, shouting all the way, "Let's talk it out, everyone, don't fight," a loud thud was heard, followed by Yu Kun's voice, shouting "Ouch!" Then the voices of the people below became a clamor.</p>
<p>Now Yu Kun's drunkenness had also been scared away! He really did not expect that Shen Mazi, who looked very strong, would be so useless. He only lightly tripped him, and he would fall straight down the handrail.</p>
<p>"Blood! Blood! Blood!" Several tea servers on night duty downstairs, and many guests who had not yet fallen asleep, immediately rushed out and surrounded Shen Mazi, who was fainting on the tile floor, shouting.</p>
<p>Begonia stood behind Zhao Yu Kun, looking down from the top of the handrail, which was more than thirty steps high. With the light of the electric lamp, she could clearly see that Shen Mazi, who had just spoken rudely, was lying on the ground like a dead dog, with fresh blood flowing from the back of his head. Just this one glance made him tremble all over like he was having a fever. (41)</p>
<p>Family</p>
<h3>Father Has a Concubine</h3>
<p>— Cao</p>
<p>My father has a concubine. She is a woman who curses, not young, but not qualified to be my mother. After she came, the family became very chaotic, divided into two factions: me, my old grandmother, and my second brother on one side; she, my father, and a nanny on the other side; competing openly and secretly for benefits. Imagine, if a family has this kind of phenomenon, can it still be run well?</p>
<p>The sound of mahjong tiles clacking resonated in my father's room all day long, making people unable to have a moment of peace, let alone think about reading and writing.</p>
<p>My old grandmother is already over seventy years old, and her failing eyes still have to sew and mend clothes for us two brothers. Really, besides her, who else would care about our clothes? Originally, she should have been enjoying her old age, but now she is troubled, for the sake of her two grandsons.</p>
<p>My mother is too weak. After being abandoned by my father for so many years, she is still quietly living a life of suffering in the countryside with my younger brother and me.</p>
<p>Every night, I think of them, and I always silently wish them happiness and health, but tears soak through my pillow again.</p>

<p>New Movie Review</p>
<h3>"The Thief of Bagdad"</h3>
<p>— Hu Fanfang</p>
<p>"The Thief of Bagdad" was originally a masterpiece by Douglas Fairbanks, but that was a silent film. Now, Alexander Korda has acquired the copyright of the old edition. After two years of production and an investment of two million US dollars, he has finally created this unparalleled mythological epic.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the story of "The Thief of Bagdad" is taken from "One Thousand and One Nights," and many people must have read the story, so there seems to be no need to repeat it here. However, for the convenience of writing, it may be helpful to mention a few points. Originally, this was a dazzling and fantastical story that took place in the ancient city of Baghdad, writing about how the thief Abu helped the prince crush the conspiracy of a cunning prime minister who understood magic, and marry the princess with whom the prince fell in love at first sight. In this, there are magical deeds, beautiful scenery, enchanting fairylands, and thrilling demons. Flying carpets, flying horses, magic arrows, spider caves, demon-suppressing bottles, heavenly eye stones, and, as the advertisements say, summoning wind and rain, and moving mountains and seas, are truly magnificent and dazzling. If you use ordinary views to measure such a film, it would be comparing apples and oranges.</p>
<p>Because all the miracles in this are a hundred and eight thousand miles away from reality, what we should ask is not whether it is possible or not, but whether it looks real or not. So, are all the miracles in "The Thief of Bagdad" real or not? The author has one sentence to say: Since the advent of color films, the beauty of the colors and the grandeur of the set design in this film are worthy of special praise. The towering palace and the dazzling and magnificent sets inside make people feel like they are floating in the air, especially the princess's tour and the scenes of the princess talking to the prince by the pool, which are indescribably beautiful. As for the giant demon released from the demon-suppressing bottle, Abu stealing the heavenly eye stone, the demon performing magic, and moving mountains and seas, although they have exhausted the grand spectacle of mystery and the ability of magic, these are all camera tricks by the photographers. It is beautiful, good, and perfect, but it is not enough to add to it, because if the director is a little smarter about things like flying horses soaring into the sky, then what you see on the screen seems to be even more beautiful and real.</p>
<p>The actors in the entire film, because of the story's magical mystery and rich interest, are easy for everyone to perform well. The best performance should be attributed to Conrad Veidt, who plays the cunning prime minister. This gentleman is quite reputable in England. Chinese audiences may still remember him, because he once played "Rasputin." He portrays the cunning prime minister's demeanor very meticulously, making the audience hate and love him at the same time. Second only to him is Sabu, who plays the leading role. His Abu is the role that Douglas Fairbanks played back then. This thief from Baghdad is very quick-witted and intelligent. Sabu's performance is also just right. June Duprez's princess is extremely beautiful. John Justin's prince is also quite competent. In short, this is a 100% film for the eyes to enjoy ice cream.</p>
<p>Finally, please let the author add one more tail: the color sound film "The Thief of Bagdad" has no moon palace and does not sell boxes, because this story has already been adapted. Many plots are different from the silent film, and the section about the moon palace and selling boxes has been changed to Abu stealing the psychic heavenly eye stone on the top of the Buddha. As for why the film title "The Thief of Bagdad" is still used, it is probably for the sake of being known to both women and children!</p>

<h3>Rudolph Valentino's Thirteenth Anniversary of Death</h3>
<p>— Kang Lin</p>
<p>Rudolph Valentino, the movie fans' lover of the silent era, is being remembered on the thirteenth anniversary of his death this year. Although he dominated the silent era, people can still remember him now, which shows how deep an impression he left on movie fans. The Valentino Commemoration Committee in Hollywood, initiated by the famous director Freney Blore, held a memorial service in a local chapel, praising Valentino's artistic achievements during his lifetime. Hundreds of movie fans participated.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Drama Society Takes Over the Xuan Palace Theater; Contract Signed and Transfer Fee Paid</h3>
<p>— Hei Ding</p>
<p>This is a lightning-like change in the Shanghai theater scene in 1940! The Shanghai Drama Society has been cooperating with the Lafayette Theater for more than a year. Although there have been unfavorable times and locations, it has fought through them with the united efforts of all members of the Drama Society. The performance of "The Family" has undoubtedly left the most glorious page in the history of drama this year. More than sixty sold-out performances have not only given the Drama Society unlimited economic and material assistance, but also proved that their two or three years of hard work have laid a solid foundation for Shanghai drama. However, the relationship that "The Family" and Lafayette can maintain is only one month, because the contract between the Drama Society and Lafayette expires at the end of February. Therefore, the audience who pre-ordered tickets for this Sunday's performance at Lafayette were politely refused.</p>
<p>The question of whether the contract between the Drama Society and Lafayette would continue has been discussed a long time ago, but there has not been a definite decision. During this period, many other theaters contacted the Drama Society, but it was only in negotiations. However, it was not long ago that the Xuan Palace Theater sent a representative to contact the Shanghai Drama Society. The process was so smooth. Relying on a previous cooperative relationship, and with the sincere attitude of both parties, Xuan Palace was very willing to transfer the entire theater to the Drama Society. So, the contract for the transfer was quickly signed. From March, the ownership of Xuan Palace will belong to the Drama Society.</p>
<p>This is the first time that a theater has been owned by a drama troupe. The Drama Society plans to make major renovations to the interior of the theater to make it suitable for performing spoken dramas. In order to ensure future development, major adjustments will be made to the repertoire and lineup. The Drama Society in 1941 will meet the audience with a brand-new look.</p>
<h3>Chinese Film Studio Shoots "Funeral for Admiral Osugi"</h3>
<p>Japanese Admiral Osugi and others recently flew to the vicinity of Hainan Island to observe, attempting to step up their southward advance. In the airspace of Zhongshan County, they were shot down by the troops of Commander Hua Yuan. Everyone in the plane, from Osugi downwards, died. The Chinese authorities, considering that Osugi and others were senior Japanese generals, specially telegraphed Yu Hanmou, ordering that Osugi and others be buried with honor at Kunlun Pass, to show the demeanor of a great power. It is learned that the China Film Studio, in order to make this fact known to the world, has telegraphed its cameraman Li Yin, who is stationed in Guilin (recently returned to Guilin after filming in Nanning), to immediately go to Kunlun Pass to film the process of the funeral for Admiral Osugi and transport the newsreel for screening at home and abroad.
