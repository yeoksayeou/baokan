<p>路透社二十三日新加坡電　紐約午後報發言人殷格索爾昨飛抵此間後稱、美國將視施於新加坡或太平洋任何他國之仇敵行動爲對美之仇敵行動、渠不信美國可容許任何他人侵犯新加坡、美總統最近送交國會請展長軍役期之咨文、乃愈近不可避免的事件之又一步驟、美國將有各種行動、以阻止希特勒之勝利云、殷格爾現將轉往重慶與莫斯科、</p>
<p>路透社二十三日河內電　駐越日本軍事使命團領袖澄田、昨晚晤越督德古、此爲德古抵河內後第二次晤談、談話結果未詳、但聞澄田刻正等候東京新訓令、</p>
<p>路透社二十三日華盛頓電　日軍雖由中國北趨外蒙古與西伯利亞之說、但此間消息靈通者、不信日本意願立即進攻西伯利亞、惟覺日本欲在越南植立更强固之地位、俾作將來乘機發展之準備、今日軍之北調、無非適合日本之觀望政策、準備於蘇聯無力抗德、完全崩潰、而遠東紅軍亦復瓦解時、向蘇施攻而已、惟日本似不期待蘇聯有此潰敗、</p>
<h3>日向維希提出佔領越南要求</h3>
<p>路透社二十三日河內電　聞日本大使七月十九日在維希提出某項交涉之結果、越南政府已遷回河內、衆信此項交涉與日本在越南南部之擴展有關、據聞日本駐越南代表團領袖澄田將軍所提出之要求、甚屬重大、</p>
<p>路透社二十三日華盛頓電　傳日本已於昨日在西貢出限期二十四小時答覆之最後通牒、要求日軍完全佔領越南、維希對於日方要求將採取何種步驟、尙無所聞、華盛頓方面之態度亦無表示、日方之最後通牒今日滿限、</p>
<p>路透社二十三日河內電　越南官立通訊社「阿利浦」昨夜發表簡短之要訊如下、「據倫敦消息、日本近向維希法政府提出關於日本在越南南部開拓之重要要求、」按以往數星期中、此間謠傳日本將在越南從事開拓、而當局嚴禁報紙登載此項消息、故各報無一字及之、今始第一次破禁、說者謂該通訊社突然發表此訊、蓋以隱示日本發動在即、且爲越南當局使人民知有所備之初次行動也</p>
<p>合衆社二十三日東京電　讀賣新聞今日載稱、日政府應採取迅速步驟、以對付英、美對泰國及越南之不斷壓力、又稱、倘不採取迅速之行動、則泰國及越南或將成爲東亞共榮團之嚴重危險地帶、該報謂盤谷之消息稱、英國之遠東軍隊、已在泰國及緬甸邊境集中、企圖壓迫泰國採取親英之政策、該報又謂、英、美之特務人員、在盤谷煽動反日及推翻泰國目前之親日政府、該報稱、頃間英國及特戈爾之特務人員在越南活動、企圖壓迫越南與日本破裂、又英美與重慶間之秘密軍事協定、更令此局勢危險、據稱、根據該項協定、大批中團軍隊已在越南之北部邊境集中云、</p>
<h3>英外相昨聲明維持越泰完整</h3>
<p>路透社二十三日倫敦電今日下院開會時、曾有人請外相艾登對於太平洋南部局勢發表言論、艾登答稱、英政府對於外間盛傳日政府擬採取行動、俾在越南南部獲得海空軍根據地之消息、早有所聞、此項消息因與日本各報諷刺英國對於越南及泰國有所謀劃之運動、適同時發生、故其意義彌覺重大、余今乘此機會聲明、日報所傳乃屬完全無稽、英國對於越南、自法國崩潰以來、雖繼續有少數貿易、但雙方關係已備受限制、至於泰國方面、則吾人之政策、純以兩國所訂不侵略條約為依歸、旣無攫取額外利益之企圖、亦無對付任何第三國之意向、</p>
<p>路透社二十三日新加坡電　日方所傳英國擬在越南有某種行動之說、昨夜新加坡無綫電台以英、法兩種文字發表一文、切實否認之、謂日方散此謠言、顯欲以此爲日本在越行動之藉口耳、對越之正常貿易關係、而絕不鼓勵可破壞越當局地位之任何希圖現悉、維希方面刻以重大壓力加諸越督德古、吾人甚盼德古能拒絕之、英國決不作可增多越南困難之任何行動云、</p>
<p>路透社二十三日新加坡電　日本駐新加坡總領事今日語路透社訪員云、此間日僑情形如常、並無奉東京命令撤退情事、渠並未接奉此項訓令云、</p>
<h3>威爾基籲請　救濟中國</h3>
<p>合衆社二十三日洛杉磯電共和黨領袖威爾基、昨晚在救濟中國聯合會所倡之集會中宣稱、渠以爲救濟中國卽等於維持美國之自由前哨云、氏籲請聽衆從東方之鬥爭中學得團結之敎訓、並將分散之份干結合、氏攻擊採取漠然之態度者、渠謂此種態度、乃國家團結之最大障礙、　稱、「同胞乎卽興起、母再採漠然之態度、其卽興起、以救國家、以救英國、以救中國、並以救民主之世界」云、</p>
<h3>向法提要求後　大批日艦南駛　越南南部如被佔據華卽採取必要行動</h3>

<p>合衆社二十三日重慶電　陸軍情報處主任楊宣誠（譯音）稱、所傳日軍在長城以北之活動、並非即謂日本必將自中國本部撤退大量軍隊也、楊氏謂、日木並未自宜昌撤退、並指出日軍在漢口地帶尙有轟炸機一百五十架至二百架之譜、在最近四川氣候小佳時、此項轟炸機並曾往返靑島作練習飛行、楊氏透露日軍將隊之人數减少、但將火力增高、每師之步兵、已由四團减爲三團、但總火力則增加、蓋往昔每連有機關槍九挺、而現時則增加至十六挺也、自一九三九年以來已有六個師團調回日本照此改組云、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>南太平洋之新危機</h3>
<p>日閣甫經改組，越南風雲驟見緊張，連日消息頻傳、紛謂武力佔領康瀾灣及西貢等地之行動，即將於三兩日內發動，而維希河內與東京之間，動向亦極形微秒。今後事態之如何發展，此際猶難預測，而對於遠東局勢輕表樂觀者，際此固已遭逢敎訓矣。</p>
<p>十八日晚日新閣首領之談話，自稱將執行自主而獨立之政策，殆表示此後日政府將超然於三國同盟與中立恊定之外，當時報章雜誌，對此亦鮮述及。而同時外相豐田之談話謂三國盟約簽字時彼曾親歷其事，故一切瞭如指掌，言外之意無寗自承其對於彼一同盟之負責態度而無怕推諉，揆之自主獨立之義，已嫌鑿枘。二十二日日外省發言人石井之談話，則逕謂日外交政策仍將以三國同盟為中心而無所變動，更顯與新閣成立時所表示及其所予人之印象不同。適於石井發言之前一日，新閣曾與大本營舉行聯絡會議，內容雖無所揭布，但可信其與石井之談話不無關聯，而連日其對外措施之見諸行動者，有如在華日軍之調動與日方對未予越種種接觸之頻繁，亦必經聯席會議有所研討。近衛—松崗內閣甫以對外政策之輕率而倒，新閣乃於甫經成立之際即擬妄動，似非常情所許，然亦唯因舊閣因對外失敗而傾圮，故現閣急功近利以蓋前愆之念亦愈切，期間殆有不容自己者也。</p>
<p>蘇德戰事爆發後，日本之背向擴展似又已闢一蹊徑，曩之深感海參崴對於三島之戰略重壓者，今乃獲有乘勢予以襲擊佔領之機會。顧蘇聯之苦禦德軍，領土縱有所蹙，抗力則愈見發皇，以納粹軍力之所向無敵，今傾全力以侵蘇，所成就者不過爾爾，此其所有助於蘇聯東疆之安全者甚大，蓋伺隙蹈瑕者流，對於一月來戰况之演進固不能不隱懷戒心也。但迥顧南太平洋方面·A·B·C·D·之聯合陣綫雖已屆完成，而越南之孤立無吿則依然如故。於堅强嚴密之防禦侵略半壁中，獨於此呈露罅隙；且該地物產豐饒，關係棊重，無論侵華或南進，均以該地為最重要之戰略據點。以今日納粹之亟需助力，其定將樂見南太平洋動亂之贊助，另一方面則必難望其予維希以任何支持。此外日當局亦或對於隱存於今日國際間之綏靖政策具有厚望，以為西方民治國之亟求遠東相安無事者或當畀予小惠以示優容，而越南之得失似亦尚無損於英美本身利益之完整，不患其竟以斷然手段相應付。是以即就客觀形勢而論。越南之危機實屬理有固然，種種傳說，即使非盡確鑿有據，亦不能僅以危言聳聽視之。</p>
<p>日方之所準備施於越南者，究為和平談判，為武力行動，抑屬以武力脅迫談判，今猶未獲端倪，而日政府之種種措置，如在華軍隊調動，郵船採緊急措施，及其國內之嚴厲檢查電報，靳發處僑護照簽證，均具有準備從事重大行動之徵象，在法越方面，固無力且無意於抗禦，其已往所做之讓步以及飲鴆止渴之苟安心理，亦使其殊鮮振拔之望。昨傳英美已就一旦日本佔領法越時所應採取之步驟成立恊定，固為世人所共同樂聞，惟此項步驟，以意揆之，殆可斷言其關於事後應付者多，涉於事前弭禍者少，則今日之中印半島實仍處於無望之地位。此項情勢如不迅謀有以改進及應變，則一旦康瀾灣及西貢而與東京河內同其遭際，南進之海空軍將無復缺乏中繼港站之虞，星島荷印之危機，亦愈益迫近眉睫矣。</p>

<p>自由談史話戰爭也有利益  蕭雲　　互相殘殺與大量消耗的戰爭，是世人所厭惡與痛恨的，然而在二十世紀的今日，人類的思想與社會組織的機構，終於還不能使人類完全避免大屠殺的重演，這當然是一件遺憾的事。　　可是從歷史上看來，我們可以發現戰爭在間接上往往也成爲人類進步的一大推動力量。所以從好的方面看，戰爭也有它的益處：　　第一，戰爭本身往往使人類明白戰爭的慘酷與無謂，增加人類建造一個沒有戰爭的世界的決心。第一次歐戰後國際聯盟的組織，結果雖屬失敗，然而這不失爲人類決心廢除戰爭的一大實騐。　　第二，戰爭可以消滅一部份的階級觀念，使社會更合理化。在此次的歐戰中，以绅士國見稱的英國，紳士氣已經大大地减少，貴族也比較平民化起來了。　　第三，戰爭增加各階暦間彼此的瞭解，使不同的文化有互相融合的機會，社會也因此進步得更快。近年來中國內地文化水準的提高，英國城市的婦孺撤退到郊外去以後，窮苦家庭的孩子，也有接受敎育餘澤的機會了。　　第四，戰爭使人民關心世局，增長史地的知識。有許多聞所未聞的人名地名，都逐漸出現在報章雜誌上了。在間接上，人與人之間也表現得比較互相關切，世界也逐漸縮小了。　　動亂時期是促進社會進步的最好機會，然而這需要聰明的人類去加以把提與利用。戰爭什麼是「V字運動」？  方作萍　　近日中西各報競載英國發，起的V字運動，引起各方讀者的注意。查此種神秘運動是由英國廣播公司一個職員發起的——據說就是勃列頓上校（Colonel　Britton）。其發動的經過情形頗饒趣味。德國大作曲家貝多芬的傑作第五交響曲在德國極爲流行，是最受德人尊崇的一首樂曲。勃列頓上校有一天發現第五交饗曲的開頭四個音符——三個半音和一個全音——如果以足或手指叩出聲音來，可以成爲英文V字的電報信號。而V字代表“Victoire”（勝利）或“Vrijheiz”（自由），在呻吟於德人鐵蹄下的歐洲大陸，這不啻是解放的象徵。勃列頓上校便開始在英國廣播公司發出這個V字的信號，聽衆之中知者漸多。英國廣播公司每天用二十多釉語言向歐洲大陸播音，一天到晚不斷的發出這個信號，不久全歐洲的人民都知道這個信號的意義了。　　在法國，比利時，荷蘭等國的牆壁上常常有人用粉筆寫出V字，這種舉動如野火般傳了開去，弄得德軍當局手忙脚亂，防不勝防。　　歐洲千千萬萬酷愛自由的人民正在用視覺和聽覺保持彼此一種精神的連繫，在黑暗中靜候解放時刻的來臨。在德國軍兵的嚴密監視下，被壓迫的民衆坐在咖啡館裏輕輕的叩着檯子，叩出三個短音和一個長音，大家聽見這個信號，都不約而同的對看着，露出會心的微笑。顧客要侍者時，多數不再出聲叫了；他們只拿起湯匙在玻璃杯上叩出三個短音和一個長音來。在燈光熄減的電影院裏，時常突然有人以口哨吹出貝多芬第五交響曲的第一節綫來——三個短音和一個長音——就是V字的信號啦。吹這種口哨的人一天多似一天了。　　這種V字信號已經在歐洲各佔領區組織了一個反納粹的神秘運動。勃列頓上校於七月二十日在英國廣播公司播音說：「V字軍之動員，結果已超出預期之外。此項浩大軍隊之勢力，現已由歐洲一端伸展至彼端。」英人所發起的這種「V字勝利運動」，可說是對德國的一種有力的大規模神經戰：其結果將在歐洲產生無數的第五縱隊，使德人的統治工作日益困難。　　德國及其佔領區雖則不許人民聽英國的廣播，違者嚴懲，可是各處的居民都冒險爭聽英國V字運動的消息。德國人看見制止不易，最近已經改變方針，將計就計，謂V字乃「德國勝利的象微」，也用各種方法在宜傳V字運動了。現在這種運動也傳到英倫三島及美國，大家對這別開生面的宣傳手段深感興趣，將來發展如何，是値得注意的。樹醫生  新亮　　我們常聽到的醫生，醫人的計有內科，外科，喉科，齒醫生等等；醫野獸的，則有狗醫生，貓醫生，馬醫生等幾種。至於會得醫治植物的毛病的樹醫生」，恐怕從來就沒有人聽見過吧。事實上，在美國的麻省，早有一位聞名的樹醫生，名叫喬治史東，他的一生就是費在解決花呀樹呀的一切疑難雜病上的。　　史東博士肄業於麻省農業學院的時候，曾對植物發生了極大的興趣，他說：「一顆樹並不僅是一種標本而已，它也是一個活的人呀！」當時，爲了要裝置電綫與煤氣管子的緣故，工人們都把路旁的樹木任意加以推殘。史東博士對於這覺得萬分不應該，於是立志在麻省專門研究怎樣保護樹木，怎樣使它們不致受到外界與害虫的傷害。他後來就在母校担任敎授，講述各項有關於樹木的植物課程。他常常會領了他的學生，手携了鑿子與鋤子到野外去敎他們怎樣修樹，醫樹的毛病。　　可惜這位樹醫生已經在前月離開人間，享年六十歲，他所來完成的工作，如今都由他的幾位得意門生繼續着在做下去。他們都當樹木也是活的人，像自己最親熱的朋友一樣。他們最大的目標；就是要使這世界變得更美麗，好讓世人享受一種美滿幸福的生活。死與活  小紫　　死不是一個仇敵，而是一個無可避免的冒險。Sir　Oliver　Lodge　　人祇有在危險時才眞正生活着。Sir　Arthur　Keith　　生命與死亡正如白天和黑夜—沒有一個，另一個就不可能。—Dr．　W．A．　White秋海棠  秦瘦鷗　　十一　夜半歌聲　　梅賣瞅着她那一份掃堂眉，獅子鼻的扮相，差一些就笑出來。「……說不定現在已掙下十萬八千萬了。誰耐煩再在這小村莊裹待着啊」？孟家的女人又特別找上了幾句。　　「唱戲能掙這麼許多的錢嗎？」梅寳似信非信地問。　　「怎麽不能？」孟家的小內掌櫃撅着她那兩片一寸多厚的血紅的嘴唇，毫不猶疑地說：「我還會騙你嗎？」　　其實梅寳也未嘗不知道這是眞話，雖然她小時候在天津英租界裹過日子，已經很糢糊了，但在李家莊上住的幾年，她的確記得比此刻快活得多，住的是大瓦房，天天吃水餃炒吃菓還有奶媽子，還有王四……簡直就像了土財主的氣派！現在想起來，這些錢當然都是她爸爸在唱戲時候掙下來的；此刻也就因爲他不再唱戲了，大家才苦到這種田地。　　孟家的兒媳瞧她低着頭儘出神，便又用力把她兩個肩膀搖撼了幾下。　　「妹妹方才我說起的尙家的舅公，他就是一個唱戲的人啊！」　　「慢一些，好嫂子，且讓我去瞧瞧爸爸，再來和你說話。」梅寳突然打斷了她的談鋒，急忙忙地走出廚房去了。　　但不到兩分鐘，她又退了出來。　　「好嫂子，我爸爸醒啦！今兒沒有功夫跟你說話了，對不起，咱們回頭再說吧！」她忽忽地端起藥碗來，先把上面蓋着的紙揭開了一些，用自己的舌尖仲進去舐了舐。「還好，沒有凉咧！對不起，好嫂子，我不送你啦」（一六六）</p>

<p>游藝界周璇嚴華正式離婚  隱　　　寄語雙方立志自重各奔前程　　影星周璇與嚴華之婚變，已歷多日，自此訊露佈後，影迷們翘首而望其結局者不知凡幾。記者於昨日下午四時許得悉此案業已宣吿解決，雙方正式離婚。據聞其離婚據上書明雙方無條件離婚，是項契　上各推一代表律師證明，周璇方面爲蔣保釐律師，嚴方則爲張福康律師，惟簽字時雙方未曾到塲晤面，周在其寓所簽字，嚴則在浦東大厦韓某之寫字間內，此事之解決，亦由韓君從中奔走而成。按周於此事發生之後，聘有律師四人，最初之信件，係委由李渭濱律師主辦寄發，嗣因形勢漸趨嚴重，有各走極端之狀，再加聘蔣保釐姜屛藩律師，相隔多日，又聘王樹勳律師加入。昨日簽約時，周方祇以蔣律■一人列名之原因，緣嚴初請之陳承蔭律師，現方赴港未回，祇張律師一人在滬可到塲證明。離婚據上雖係無條件，但嚴周夫婦住所內之像具，則由嚴方領受；周方取得鋼琴一架及其本人之衣服。至於周於離寓時取去之銀行存摺等，則仍歸於周。至此一塲風波，吿一段落。外行劇話  畸人　　看淸宮怨以後這一年來，接連看了三個很有個値的歷史劇；第一次是中旅的葛嫩娘，第二次是洪宣嬌，也是由中旅演出的，第三次是天風此刻在上演的淸宮怨。就意識來講，自該推葛嫩娘爲第一，淸宮怨和洪宣嬌都差一些。可是劇本的結構和舞臺上演出的成績，却大致都很好。此時此地，能够看到這樣的話劇，也應該可以說一聲滿意了。天風上演淸宮怨之前，的確是用了全部的力量來準備的；所以，這幾天連賣滿座，也可以說是上下一致努力的結果。除掉編劇姚克和導演費穆之外，在那兩條綢幕的背後，正還不知道藏着多少不漏臉不出名的劇壇英雄咧！　　各方對於淸宮怨的批許，十九是讚美的，不過，照我個人的意思，似乎還有幾處可以改進。　　譬如辱妃一幕，演出的時候大槪因爲要顧到主角的身份起見，辱的程度似乎還不够深刻；而反之，珍妃所施於西太后的反駁，又嫌太誇張一些，使我們不免感覺到終究珍妃是主角，所以能够把被安放在配角地位的西太后「吃癟」了。演員的成績，照我看來，都相當成功，畢竟劇壇老手，演來無懈可擊。暑期戲講座　主霽人已聘定  星　　石揮等組織之「暑期戲劇講座」決定八月一日開飴，今已開始報名，在靑年會辦理，每星期三五上午九時半舉行，共計九次，主講者及講題如下：「中國戲劇的發展」趙景深，一西洋戲劇的發展」顧仲彝，「談編劇經騐」吳天，「導演與演員的關係」黃佐臨，「演技的基礎」陳西禾，「舞臺表演與日常生活」吳仞之，「論裝置」徐渠，「歐美的演技」姚克，「戲劇批評」魯思。滬江大學生之義舉　演劇籌款助學　　滬江大學同學，課餘爲謀高尙娛樂計，特組織競社票房，以硏討平劇爲旨趣。最近本報發起助學金之舉，社會熱心人士，均予以贊助，該社為響應義舉，擬於最近期內演劇籌款，捐作本報助學金。邇來該社社友正加緊排練各劇，公演之期，本刊另行報導。該社熱心公益，殊可欣佩，查滬上票房林立，想必能聞風繼起，一致推動也。　　（編者按）滬江同學，演劇籌款，資助淸寒學子，以示首創，實堪欽佩，此後如有其他劇團繼起響應者，請隨時通知本刋，當竭誠贊助也。血雨瓊葩  頋明道　　第十三章　不肯低頭在草莽　　手中白龍寳劍已向包黑炭頭上掃來，包黑炭起初不把柳隱英看在眼裏，儘把雙刀舞開，和柳隱英酣戰。戰至三十合以上，柳隱英的一柄劍神出鬼沒，龍飛鳳舞，包黑炭有些抵敵不在，正想如何乘隙着手，只聽嗆啷一聲，自己左手刀正迎着柳隱英的劍鋒，早被白龍寳劍削爲兩截。包黃炭更是心慌，將右手刀虛晃一下，纔想跳出圈子而逃。柳隱英劍法敏捷，早又一劍削到他的脅下。包黑炭躱　不及，大叫一聲，中劍墮馬，躺在血泊裏，眼見得不活了。柳隱英又向四騎卒將劍一陣橫掃，一死二傷，餘一卒丟了馬上的婦女遁去。此時許靖也已和强克勝交手，正在不分勝負之際，强克勝見包黑炭已死於劍光之下，心慌意亂，手中刀法散漫，被許靖得個間隙，一槍挑於馬下。二人旣把流寇的主將殺却，又向前誅滅寇衆，馬蹄到處，人橫馬仆，五百騎卒祇剩一半逃回去，地下東倒西歪的都是死人與死馬。柳隱英殺了一陣，和許靖掉轉馬頭，到那女子的馬前，見那馬正在屍骸堆裏逡巡未去。柳隱英首先跳下馬來，過去解開他們的束縛，立到地上。兩女子知道柳隱英是救護他們的，慌忙同他跪倒。許靖也下馬走來，把槍插在地上，聽柳隱英和他們講話。柳隱英問道：「你們是不是寗武關逃出的難民？往那裏去的？可有家人同行？」一個年紀比較大一些的說道：「我們姓姜，是姊妹倆，本是寗武關外吉隆鎭人，只因流寇破了寗武關，又到我們鎮上來搜索官軍，殺人放火，我們姊妹倆跟着父母逃難，不幸走得未遠，流寇追及，我們和父母失散後，又被流寇據去，自分必死，幸遇二位將爺解救，終身感德。」柳隱英道：「你們本想逃到什麽地方去的呢？」女子答道：「離此六十里外有個李家堡，那裏有我的舅舅，我父親正想帶我們同去那裏躱避的。」柳隱英道：「你們認識到那邊去的途徑嗎？」女子點點頭道：「依稀認得。」隱英道：「很好，你們快些逃生去吧，恐怕流寇再要追上來呢。」姊妹倆聽了柳隱英的話，又向二人拜謝，然後走上官道去。（一二三）棋苑  莆田連學正編　　第三二七局　聲東擊西　俞登榮擬　紅先勝　　第三二六局「三潭印月」着法如下（紅先勝）　　卒七進一（變）將四進一　卒五平六　將四平五　卒六平五将五平四　砲七平六　兵三平四　卒五平六　将四平五　卒四平五　车五退二　卒六平五　将五平四　卒五进一象三退五　馬七退五　（勝）（接變）卒七進一　將四退一卒七進一　將四平五　砲八進八　士五退四　卒七平六將五平　四車四進一　（勝）</p>

        <h1>1941.07.24</h1>
<h3>The South Pacific Crisis Intensifies: England and the United States Establish an Agreement; Determine Response Steps for Future Vietnamese Situation; Dekoux and Japanese Representatives Hold Second Meeting</h3>
<p>Reuter's, Chongqing, 23rd: Reliable foreign sources here suggest that large-scale Japanese actions in the Pacific are imminent. It is reported that Japan's mobilization is now in full swing, and the third-level reserves have been called up. The requisition of cars and livestock is currently underway. Another source predicts that Japan will take action against southern Vietnam on July 25th.</p>
<p>Associated Press, London, 23rd: It was learned yesterday that, after detailed discussions, England and the United States have established a full agreement on the steps to be taken if Japan occupies French Indochina. The contents of this measure have not yet been disclosed. The three governments with a direct interest in the Far East have all received reports stating that Japan will forcefully occupy Cam Ranh Bay and other key points in southern Vietnam within two or three days. It is believed here that the troops of Lieutenant General Dekoux, the Governor-General of Vietnam, may not resist. The armed forces of Vietnam total approximately 45,000, of which 25,000 are white French, and the rest are Annamese. There are also 50,000 more who can be mobilized. The general opinion in London diplomatic circles is that Japan will occupy Vietnam before attacking Siberia. Non-Soviet sources say that there are sixty Soviet divisions in Siberia, including mechanized units and powerful air forces.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Singapore, 23rd: After arriving here yesterday, Mr. Ingersoll, a spokesman for the New York afternoon newspaper, said that the United States would regard any hostile action against Singapore or any other country in the Pacific as a hostile action against the United States. He does not believe that the United States can allow anyone to invade Singapore. The US President's recent message to Congress requesting an extension of military service is another step closer to inevitable events. The United States will take various actions to prevent Hitler's victory. Mr. Ingersoll will now proceed to Chongqing and Moscow.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Hanoi, 23rd: Mr. Sumida, the leader of the Japanese military mission in Vietnam, met with Vietnamese Governor Dekoux last night. This was the second meeting since Dekoux arrived in Hanoi. The results of the talks are unknown, but it is said that Sumida is currently awaiting new instructions from Tokyo.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Washington, 23rd: Although there is talk of Japanese troops moving north from China towards Outer Mongolia and Siberia, well-informed sources here do not believe that Japan intends to attack Siberia immediately. However, they feel that Japan wants to establish a stronger foothold in Vietnam in order to prepare for future opportunities for development. Today's northward troop movement is nothing more than suiting Japan's wait-and-see policy, preparing to attack the Soviet Union when it is unable to resist Germany, completely collapses, and the Far Eastern Red Army also disintegrates. However, Japan does not seem to expect the Soviet Union to suffer such a defeat.</p>
<h3>Japan Proposes Occupation of Vietnam to Vichy</h3>
<p>Reuter's, Hanoi, 23rd: It is heard that as a result of a certain negotiation proposed by the Japanese ambassador in Vichy on July 19, the Vietnamese government has moved back to Hanoi. It is believed that this negotiation is related to the expansion of Japan in southern Vietnam. It is said that the demands made by General Sumida, the leader of the Japanese delegation in Vietnam, are very significant.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Washington, 23rd: It is rumored that Japan issued an ultimatum in Saigon yesterday, with a 24-hour deadline for a response, demanding that Japanese troops completely occupy Vietnam. It is not yet known what steps Vichy will take regarding the Japanese demands. Washington has also made no statement on the matter. The Japanese ultimatum expires today.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Hanoi, 23rd: The official Vietnamese news agency "Alipur" issued a brief important news item last night as follows: "According to London news, Japan has recently made important demands to the Vichy French government regarding Japanese development in southern Vietnam." According to past weeks, rumors have been circulating here that Japan will engage in development in Vietnam, and the authorities have strictly prohibited newspapers from publishing this news. Therefore, no newspaper has mentioned it. This is the first time the ban has been broken. It is said that the sudden publication of this news by the news agency is to implicitly indicate that Japan is about to launch an attack, and it is the first action by the Vietnamese authorities to make the people aware and prepared.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Tokyo, 23rd: The Yomiuri Shimbun reported today that the Japanese government should take swift steps to deal with the constant pressure from England and the United States on Thailand and Vietnam. It also stated that if swift action is not taken, Thailand and Vietnam may become serious danger zones for the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The newspaper said that news from Bangkok stated that the British Far East forces have concentrated on the Thai and Burmese borders, attempting to force Thailand to adopt a pro-British policy. The newspaper also said that British and American agents are instigating anti-Japanese sentiment and overthrowing the current pro-Japanese government of Thailand in Bangkok. The newspaper claimed that recently British and Tejer agents have been active in Vietnam, attempting to force Vietnam to break with Japan. Furthermore, the secret military agreement between England, the United States, and Chongqing has made the situation even more dangerous. It is said that according to this agreement, a large number of Chinese troops have concentrated on the northern border of Vietnam.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Declares Yesterday to Maintain the Integrity of Vietnam and Thailand</h3>
<p>Reuter's, London, 23rd: During today's House of Commons meeting, Foreign Secretary Eden was asked to comment on the situation in the South Pacific. Eden replied that the British government has long been aware of rumors that the Japanese government intends to take action to obtain naval and air bases in southern Vietnam. This news coincides with the Japanese newspapers' movement satirizing British plots against Vietnam and Thailand, so its significance is even greater. I now take this opportunity to declare that what the Japanese newspapers report is completely unfounded. Although England has continued to have a small amount of trade with Vietnam since the collapse of France, relations between the two sides have been greatly restricted. As for Thailand, our policy is purely based on the non-aggression treaty signed by the two countries. We have no intention of seizing additional interests, nor do we intend to deal with any third country.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Singapore, 23rd: Regarding Japanese rumors that England intends to take some action in Vietnam, last night the Singapore radio station issued an article in English and French, firmly denying it. It said that the Japanese are spreading this rumor, obviously wanting to use it as an excuse for Japanese actions in Vietnam. Normal trade relations with Vietnam will be maintained, and no attempts that could undermine the position of the Vietnamese authorities will be encouraged. It is now known that Vichy is placing great pressure on Vietnamese Governor Dekoux. We hope that Dekoux can reject it. England will not take any action that could increase the difficulties of Vietnam.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Singapore, 23rd: The Japanese Consul General in Singapore told a Reuter's interviewer today that the situation of Japanese residents here is normal, and there have been no orders from Tokyo to evacuate. He has not received such instructions.</p>
<h3>Willkie Calls For Relief to China</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Los Angeles, 23rd: Republican leader Willkie declared at a rally promoted by the United Relief to China Association last night that he believes that providing relief to China is equivalent to maintaining the outposts of American freedom. He urged the audience to learn the lessons of unity from the struggle in the East and combine the dispersed forces. He attacked those who adopted an indifferent attitude, saying that this attitude is the biggest obstacle to national unity. He said, "Fellow countrymen, arise immediately, do not adopt an indifferent attitude again, arise immediately to save the country, to save England, to save China, and to save the democratic world."</p>
<h3>After Making Demands to France, Large Numbers of Japanese Warships Head South; If Southern Vietnam is Occupied, China Will Take Necessary Actions</h3>
<p>Reuter's, Chongqing, 23rd: General Yang Xuancheng (transliteration), Director of the Army Intelligence Department, made a statement at a special press conference this afternoon, saying that Japan is now proposing to Vichy the demand for naval and air bases and the landing of troops in southern Vietnam in order to invade Thailand and Burma. Japanese warships and troops are now moving south. According to a telegram from Vichy on the 21st, Japan's demands to Vichy are as follows: (1) Use Cam Ranh Bay as a naval base; (2) Use Saigon as an air base; (3) Troops land and station in southern Vietnam. Yesterday, seven Japanese warships, three aircraft carriers, and fifty-five destroyers were discovered near Kyushu in southern Japan, heading south. At the same time, there were thirty transport ships, escorted by three warships, heading south from 　 Prefecture. The Vichy government is currently rejecting Japan's demands. According to its colonial department, Vietnam will resist any military occupation. When asked what action China would take if Japan invaded southern Vietnam, Yang replied that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement a year ago, on the eve of Japan's occupation of northern Vietnam, stating that China would take necessary measures to defend itself. Yang also said that Japan's southward movement would not hinder its northward attack, because military action in Vietnam only requires a small number of ground troops.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Chongqing, 23rd: Yang Xuancheng (transliteration), Director of the Army Intelligence Department, said that the reported activities of Japanese troops north of the Great Wall do not mean that Japan will necessarily withdraw a large number of troops from mainland China. Yang said that Japan has not withdrawn from Yichang, and pointed out that there are still 150 to 200 bombers in the Hankou area. When the weather in Sichuan was recently favorable, these bombers also made training flights to and from Qingdao. Yang revealed that the Japanese army reduced the number of troops in the team but increased its firepower. The infantry of each division has been reduced from four regiments to three regiments, but the overall firepower has increased. In the past, each company had nine machine guns, but now it has increased to sixteen. Since 1939, six divisions have been transferred back to Japan for this reorganization.</p>
<h3>Sino-British Development Society Established in England; Purely a Commercial Organization Seeking to Increase Mutual Interests</h3>
<p>Reuter's, London, 23rd: The Aid China Association held a luncheon, which was well attended. Member of Parliament and Chairman of the Cooperative Society, Mr. Pons, announced the establishment of the Sino-British Development Society. The purpose of this society is to support the industrial cooperative movement in China. He said that he first came into contact with the matter of supporting Chinese cooperatives in 1939. There are many difficulties in this issue, partly due to British legal restrictions, which do not allow direct financial assistance from cooperatives. Today, the Sino-British Development Society is a compromise to deal with this difficulty. The society has several Chinese and British members, many commercial and technical specialists, and several shareholders. This is purely a commercial organization that seeks profits. It has obtained guarantees from the Chinese government before starting business. Currently, most of the business is purchasing machinery for industrial cooperatives and providing loans to cooperative members. In the future, it will focus on exporting Chinese goods to England. Currently, it is in its initial stage, and the scope is still small, but he believes that if this method is promoted throughout the world, it can increase mutual economic interests and become the most stable foundation for peace. The chairman, Dr. Guo Bingwen, detailed the achievements already made by Chinese industrial cooperatives, saying that the current 2,000 cooperatives are one of the brightest scenes in China's resistance and construction.</p>
<h3>Japan Strictly Inspects Telegrams; US Recognizes Significant Meaning</h3>
<p>Reuter's, Washington, 23rd: President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that the Japanese government has recently begun to inspect wireless and wired telegrams. When asked if he anticipated any new aggression by Japan in the near future, the President declined to answer, saying that the question should be directed to the State Department. When asked if he considered Japan's inspection to be important, the President replied yes, but did not elaborate. When reporters gathered at the White House to attend the reception, the President's naval adjutant presented the President with a telegram that the Navy Department had just received. The telegram stated that Japan had begun to inspect telegrams.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 23rd: President Roosevelt said at a press conference yesterday that he believed Japan's strict inspection was of great significance. Japanese authorities have now established new regulations for the use of telephone and telegraph communication lines.</p>
<h3>Malayan Federation Takes Emergency Measures; Merchant Ships Ordered to Arm Themselves to Deal with Any Attack</h3>
<p>Reuter's, Bangkok, 23rd: Japanese sources say that according to the "Klong" newspaper, the naval authorities of the Malayan Federation have ordered all merchant ships, especially those over 5,000 tons, to be equipped with anti-aircraft guns and small steel cannons in order to repel any attack. The newspaper also said that the Malayan authorities immediately took this emergency step after the cabinet reshuffle last Sunday.</p>
<h3>Japan Will Hold Emergency Meeting; Shigemitsu Meets Toyoda</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Tokyo, 23rd: Domei News Agency announced today that the Privy Council will convene an "extraordinary plenary session" within this week to discuss various issues facing the nation. The Privy Council held its regular meeting in the Imperial Palace this morning, attended by the Japanese Emperor and the members of the new Konoe Cabinet.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Tokyo, 23rd: Foreign Minister Toyoda today appointed Yamamoto, Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as Acting Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and accepted the resignations of Shiraori and Saito, advisors to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Shiraori and Saito were appointed after Matsuoka became Foreign Minister. According to diplomatic conventions, Toyoda is scheduled to meet with foreign diplomats on Friday. Regarding this matter, the Asahi Shimbun reported that Toyoda may use this opportunity to clarify that Japan's foreign policy has not changed and is still based on the Tripartite Pact.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd: Japanese Ambassador to England Shigemitsu held a secret two-hour meeting with Foreign Minister Toyoda at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday. It is heard that Shigemitsu has made a detailed report on the situation in England.</p>
<h3>US Willing to Buy Raw Materials from the Soviet Union; But Shipping is Difficult</h3>
<p>Reuter's, Washington, 23rd: Jesse Jones, head of the Federal Loan Agency, told reporters yesterday that the United States had stated to Soviet Ambassador to the United States Umansky a week ago that the United States was willing to buy important raw materials that the Soviet Union wanted to sell in order to help the Soviet Union pay for the war materials purchased in the United States. However, he did not know when this transaction could be realized. The only difficulty is transporting raw materials such as manganese and chromium from the Soviet Union to Vladivostok, and then finding ships to transport them to the United States. The US purchases in the Soviet Union do not necessarily have to be equal to what the Soviet Union purchases in the United States. The Soviet Union has a lot of cash and has not requested loans.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>New Crisis in the South Pacific</h3>
<p>The Japanese cabinet has just been reorganized, and the situation in Vietnam has suddenly become tense. News has been frequently reported in recent days, saying that actions to forcefully occupy Cam Ranh Bay and Saigon are about to be launched within the next two or three days. The movements between Vichy, Hanoi, and Tokyo are also extremely subtle. It is still difficult to predict how the situation will develop in the future, and those who lightly express optimism about the situation in the Far East have already encountered a lesson at this moment.</p>
<p>In his speech on the evening of the 18th, the leader of the new Japanese cabinet claimed that he would implement an autonomous and independent policy, probably indicating that the Japanese government would transcend the Tripartite Alliance and the Neutrality Pact. At that time, newspapers and magazines rarely mentioned this. At the same time, Foreign Minister Toyoda said that he had personally experienced the signing of the Tripartite Pact, so he understood everything clearly. The implied meaning was that he was willing to assume his responsible attitude towards the alliance without fear of shirking. Judging from the meaning of autonomy and independence, it was already somewhat incompatible. In his speech on the 22nd, Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Ishii directly stated that Japan's foreign policy would still be centered on the Tripartite Alliance without any change, which was even more different from the expression given by the new cabinet when it was established and the impression it gave people. Coincidentally, the new cabinet had held a liaison meeting with the General Staff Headquarters the day before Ishii's speech. Although the content was not disclosed, it is believed that it was related to Ishii's speech. Furthermore, the actions taken by the new cabinet in its external measures in recent days, such as the troop movements of the Japanese army in China and the frequent contact between the Japanese side and Vietnam, must have been discussed in a joint meeting. The Konoe-Matsuoka cabinet had just collapsed due to its rash foreign policy. The new cabinet intends to act rashly immediately after its establishment, which seems unacceptable to normal reasoning. However, it is only because the old cabinet collapsed due to foreign policy failures that the current cabinet is more eager to achieve quick results to cover up the previous mistakes. There is probably no room for them to do otherwise.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, Japan's backward expansion seems to have opened up a new path. Those who were deeply concerned about the strategic pressure of Vladivostok on the Japanese archipelago in the past now have the opportunity to take advantage of the situation to attack and occupy it. However, although the Soviet Union is fiercely resisting the German army and its territory has shrunk, its resistance is becoming more and more vigorous. The Nazi military strength is invincible, but now it is exerting all its strength to invade the Soviet Union, and the achievements are only so-so. This is of great help to the security of the Soviet Union's eastern border. Those who are waiting for opportunities to take advantage of loopholes cannot but harbor deep concern about the evolution of the war situation in the past month. However, looking back at the South Pacific, although the A·B·C·D· united front has been completed, the isolation of Vietnam remains the same. In the strong and strict defense against aggression, only this place has a gap. Moreover, the area is rich in resources and of great importance. Whether invading China or advancing southward, this area is the most important strategic base. Given that the Nazis are in dire need of help today, they will certainly be happy to support turmoil in the South Pacific. On the other hand, it will be difficult to expect them to provide any support to Vichy. In addition, the Japanese authorities may also have high hopes for the appeasement policy that still exists in the international community today, believing that the Western democratic countries that are eager for peace in the Far East may give small favors to show tolerance, and that the gain or loss of Vietnam does not seem to harm the integrity of the interests of Britain and the United States themselves. They are not afraid that they will respond with decisive measures. Therefore, judging from the objective situation. The crisis in Vietnam is indeed a matter of course. Even if the rumors are not entirely reliable, they cannot be regarded as mere scaremongering.</p>
<p>Whether what the Japanese are preparing to impose on Vietnam is peaceful negotiations, military action, or forced negotiations under the threat of force, there is still no clue. The Japanese government's various measures, such as the troop movements in China, the emergency measures for mail ships, the strict inspection of telegrams in the country, and the reluctance to issue overseas Chinese passports and visas, all have the signs of preparing to engage in major actions. On the French-Vietnamese side, there is no power and no intention to resist. The concessions it has made in the past and the psychology of quenching thirst with poison have also made it lack hope for improvement. Yesterday it was reported that England and the United States had reached an agreement on the steps to be taken once Japan occupied French Indochina, which was welcomed by the world. However, judging from the intention of these steps, it can almost be asserted that they are mostly about dealing with the aftermath and less about preventing disasters beforehand. Therefore, the Indochina Peninsula is still in a hopeless position today. If this situation is not quickly improved and prepared for contingencies, then once Cam Ranh Bay and Saigon suffer the same fate as Tokyo and Hanoi, the southward naval and air forces will no longer lack the danger of transshipment ports, and the crisis in Singapore and the Dutch East Indies is even more imminent.</p>

<h3>Spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission Explains the Kuomintang-Communist Incident</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Reporter - Reading the *Xinhua Daily's* article of the 22nd, "The Truth About the Actions of the Eighteenth Group Army" (Central News Agency note: the newspaper published on the 22nd, saying it had a Yu (6th) telegram replying to the Ge (5th) telegram of the Military Affairs Department, but used a telegram with an unproven month to shirk the responsibility of replying early, avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial. It is indeed a weak argument. The spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission has opened up each point in the following text, holding them accountable with righteous principles), it is quite suspicious. I visited the spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission again to inquire about the matter. The spokesperson said: (1) On June 25th, the Commission received a telegram from a certain general in the Taiyue front lines, dated Hao (19th) of June, reporting that the Eighteenth Group Army had attacked friendly forces in southeastern Shanxi and seized administrative power. The Military Affairs Department sent a Gan (27th) telegram in the same month to Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, ordering him to stop it. After it was sent, there was no reply for a long time. Therefore, a Wei (5th) telegram was sent again in July, ordering compliance. (2) When reporters from your agency visited the other day, I told you this. Unexpectedly, when your agency published the two Mengjin telegrams and one telegram each from Zhengzhou and a certain place in Shandong, obtained by your agency, on July 18th, you placed my words at the head of the four telegrams, entitled "Military News." In fact, the Military Affairs Department only sent telegrams to Commander-in-Chief Zhu De regarding the southeastern Shanxi incident, ordering him to stop it. There were no telegrams for the other two places. Therefore, the original telegram from the Military Affairs Department was published yesterday (20th) to clarify the truth. The above four telegrams all concern matters in June. News reporters, in order to save time and be quick, often do not want to specify the month and day, resulting in providing an excuse for criticism. It is really regrettable. As for the Yu (6th) telegram of July from Commander-in-Chief Zhu published by the *Xinhua Daily*, the Military Affairs Department of this Commission only received it today (July 22nd). It was copied and sent by Qian Zhixian, the director of the Group Army's office in Chongqing, and there was no original telegram. The date on which the office copied and sent it was also written as July 9th. According to my speculation, the Military Affairs Department sent the telegram on July 5th. It would usually take two or three days to reach Commander-in-Chief Zhu's headquarters, about after the 7th, to receive it. At the earliest, it could be replied on the 8th. Now it is said that the telegram was sent Yu, which is not true. There is no such speed. In short, it is indeed a fact that the Dare-to-Die Corps of the Group Army has illegal actions. The Ge telegram of the Military Affairs Department was announced yesterday, and the end of the telegram said, "Cooperate with each other and unite against Japan." This is the greatest purpose of the Commission. I hope you will understand this intention and live up to the expectations of the people. I also have no desire to engage in verbal debates with them, causing laughter and pleasing the enemies," etc. (Telegram of the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Huang Yunlong Sacrifices His Life; Request for Preferential Treatment</h3>
<p>Changde - Huang Yunlong, a soldier of Hua's unit, was dispatched on the 11th of last month to reconnaissance behind enemy lines. On the way, he encountered many Japanese soldiers. Huang fought them alone, but because of the disparity in numbers, he was captured by the Japanese. The Japanese army repeatedly used severe torture, but Huang did not answer at all. The Japanese army then killed Huang. Huang was still calm and sacrificed heroically when he faced death. Now the unit has reported the heroic situation of Huang to the higher authorities, requesting preferential treatment to comfort the spirit of the hero. (Telegram of the 21st)</p>

<h3>Hankou Bans English News Businesses; Reuters and *Chu Pao* Forced to Close</h3>
<p>Reuters News - Under the Japanese rule in Hankou, the Chinese authorities have virtually banned English news businesses. Reuters and the *Chu Pao*, run by the British, have been forced to cease operations. Ostensibly, the closure of the two places is due to a strike by Chinese employees, but behind the scenes, someone is instigating it. All the Chinese employees of Reuters did not go to work in the office on the morning of July 15th and did not make any requests. It is heard that one of them has been arrested by plainclothes soldiers. Yesterday, the situation suddenly turned serious. According to news received in Shanghai today, the residence of Mr. Que Bart, the publisher of the *Chu Pao* and acting manager of Reuters, was searched by armed men, and it is heard that there was considerable property loss as a result. The Japanese authorities in Hankou denied any knowledge of the matter and refused to take any responsibility. According to the report, this incident started on July 14th when the employees of *Chu Pao* asked the management for a large increase in rice subsidies. The management agreed to consider the matter for two days. The employees had already agreed, but stopped working and left a few minutes later. It was later learned that they were threatened by rioters. Afterwards, according to reliable sources, all employees of the *Chu Pao* are now being held in a Chinese hotel, not allowed to communicate with the outside world. The food and accommodation are quite good, but the security is very strict. The British Consul-General Davidson has urged the municipal government and the Japanese consulate to pay attention to the above threats. At the same time, the management of *Chu Pao* has received news that the following four conditions will be proposed: (1) All employees must be given more freedom to do whatever they want; (2) Employees organize a union; (3) Grant rice subsidies in unspecified amounts; (4) *Chu Pao* merges with the *Wuhan Daily*, only allowing the English translation of the news already published in the Chinese newspaper. Reuters or news from Allied countries are not allowed to be published.</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles Occur Within Finland; War in Ukraine Shifts Eastward; Germany Makes Pincer Movement on Leningrad; Red Army in Central Region Launches Fierce Counter-Offensive</h3>
<p>Reuter's, London, 23rd - According to official reports and other sources, the situation on the Eastern Front this morning is approximately as follows: (1) In Finland, the direction of the German offensive is between Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega. The German objectives are threefold: First, to isolate the Soviet forces in the north; second, to bypass Lake Ladoga and attack the rear of the Leningrad defense line; third, to threaten the canal through which Soviet warships pass from the Gulf of Finland to the White Sea. (2) Leningrad area: The Soviet official report did not mention Pskov. The battle 45 miles east of that place is not enough to indicate that the German army has made progress. (3) Smolensk area: According to neutral sources, the Soviet army is currently launching a fierce counter-offensive east of the city. Last night, German radio broadcasts also stated that Soviet artillery fire was extremely fierce. (4) Ukraine: Soviet sources say that there is fierce fighting 80 miles west of Kyiv. The German side says that German, Hungarian, and Slovak troops are currently pursuing the Soviet army.</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 23rd - According to yesterday's news, the German army, which has been fighting on the Ukrainian front for ten days, suddenly invaded the Jitomir area, 20 miles west of Kyiv, yesterday. The Soviet High Command issued an official report describing the "large-scale" battle situation in the Jitomir area. Since the war began, this official report first mentioned this area yesterday, indicating that the Soviet army has retreated 68 miles. The official report also mentioned the fierce battles in the Smolensk area and the northeast and south areas of Leningrad. However, the official report still stated that the position of the Finnish front line has not changed in practice. The official report also stated that there are fierce battles in Pokov, 145 miles south of Leningrad, and Petrozafotsk, 200 miles northeast of Leningrad, east of Lake Ladoga.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 23rd - Fierce battles last night and this morning in four areas: Petrozafotsk, Pokov, Smolensk, and Jitomir in Ukraine. The Soviet Air Force fiercely bombed enemy airfields and fought with enemy aircraft. 39 enemy aircraft were destroyed, and the Soviet Union lost 17 aircraft.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 22nd - According to the latest news from the Eastern Front, the Soviet army is currently fighting fiercely to contain the new German offensive to invade Leningrad, Moscow, and Kyiv from three routes. Fierce battles took place all day yesterday in the Smolensk salient. It is heard that the German army in the area attempted to launch a large encirclement operation against the Soviet army in the Nibel River Bay area. The recent Soviet official report said that the Soviet army in Ukraine has retreated from Novograd Volynsky near the old border of 1938 to Jitomir (85 miles west of Kyiv). The German army, which is making a pincer attack on Leningrad, is still being blocked in the southeast of Lake Peipus, but the German army advancing from Finland has entered the 80-mile wide isthmus between Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega. The Soviet official report mentioned this line for the first time, saying that there are currently battles around Petrozafotsk (Petrozavodsk), 110 miles northeast of Leningrad, on the railway to Murmansk. It is heard that Soviet paratroopers have landed behind the Finnish-German front line. On Tuesday, 87 German aircraft were shot down, and the Soviet Union lost only 14 aircraft. Moscow Radio Station said that according to the latest figures, 22 German aircraft were shot down in the night attack on Moscow on Monday. The latest German official report stated that the German army and Allied forces broke through the Soviet defense line, dividing the Soviet defenders into multiple teams, unable to adjust. Although the Soviet army made local fierce resistance and launched fierce counter-offensives, the enemy army is now unable to adjust its command. The German army on the entire front is constantly carrying out its war to completely annihilate the isolated Soviet army.</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Attack on Soviet Capital Fails; Stalin Commends Air Defense Personnel</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 23rd - Late yesterday night, 150 German aircraft again raided Moscow, but still failed. Our Air Force defense team and anti-aircraft fire prevented most of the German aircraft from reaching Moscow. Only a few German aircraft broke into the city's airspace. Several houses in the city caught fire and were extinguished by firefighters and the public. Only two hospitals were more severely damaged. Military targets were not damaged. According to preliminary statistics, 15 enemy aircraft were shot down by our night flying fighters and anti-aircraft guns.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Berlin, 22nd - German official news agency news, another powerful German Air Force fleet bombed Moscow's important military targets last night. According to current reports, fires were seen everywhere after the first batch of German aircraft dropped bombs.</p>
<p>Havas, Moscow, 22nd - Stalin recently issued an order in the name of the People's Commissar of Defense, praising the Moscow air defense forces for their actions during the bombing by German aircraft last night. The text reads, "Last night, the German aircraft group attempted to bomb Moscow. Fortunately, due to the diligence of the local air defense forces, no damage was suffered. The enemy aircraft were discovered early and were shot down by our fighter jets and anti-aircraft guns before they reached Moscow. The searchlight units were also able to perform their duties. More than 200 German aircraft in batches raided the capital and were all dispersed by us. Only a few broke into the city's airspace and dropped a few bombs, which immediately caught fire and spread. After being watered by the fire brigade, they were quickly extinguished. According to reports from all parties, a total of 22 German aircraft were shot down. The People's Committee of Defense expresses its appreciation for (1) the anti-aircraft gun team, searchlight team, and observation team, (2) night fighter jets, (3) the fire brigade and other public officials, all of whom are loyal to their duties, and ordered the Moscow Garrison Command to register the responsible personnel and report them so that they can be praised one by one.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Berlin, 23rd - Yesterday afternoon, the German official news agency mentioned for the first time the German aircraft's air raid on Moscow. It is said that the German bomber and dive bomber team continuously attacked from dusk to dawn, dropping thousands of various high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs on Moscow's military important targets. A large fire was seen south of the Moscow River. According to reports, there were 12 explosions near the Kremlin. This attack can be compared with the most fierce forest bombing carried out against military important targets in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>According to the German official report, the German aircraft's attack on Moscow was to retaliate for the Soviet aircraft's bombing of the "undefended capitals" of Roumania and Finland. The German bombers, in teams of twelve, continuously bombed military facilities, munitions, and factories. The Kremlin and the Moscow River Bay area were hit by bombs and caught fire.</p>
<h3>Red Army in Leningrad Area Defends Strongly</h3>
<p>United Press, Vichy, 23rd - French newspaper military analysts said yesterday that they expect a long war between Germany and the Soviet Union for Leningrad. The *Kleran Frante Post* said that Leningrad is a modern city with a strong defense. The city of one million people is surrounded by strong defense projects covering 30 square miles. The deployment of turrets, tanks, and landmines extends north to Lake Ladoga and the Gulf of Finland, and west to the Folda Mountains, the Lalhua River, the Folika River, and Lake Peipus. The Stalin defense line also includes Leningrad. The fortresses are located as far as Pskov. The fortress seems to be still in the hands of the Soviet army. According to news arriving here, there were fierce artillery sounds from the Hanko Island yesterday morning. French military analysis believes that the artillery sounds are sufficient evidence to attack Hanko. The Soviet Union occupied Hanko Island in 1940, and today it has become an outpost of Leningrad. The ports of the Gulf of Finland stretch for 950 miles. When the Soviet Union can hold Pskov, it is impossible for the Germans to advance from the south to Leningrad.</p>
<h3>Odessa and Leningrad Attacked by German Aircraft Fleets</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 23rd - The *News* published details of the air battle near Leningrad as follows: "The command issued a notice: 'Enemy aircraft are flying towards Leningrad. Soviet pilots take off immediately.' Soon, eight enemy bombers and ten fighter jets were seen approaching the city's airspace. The Soviet pilots responded resolutely and, after the battle began, ten young pilots, including Gorovying, Qin Chengke, and Chimo Danov, each shot down one enemy aircraft. Adjutant Pekelin flew behind ten enemy aircraft and shot down the enemy aircraft with direct fire. The enemy fighters rushed forward in an attempt to assist, but it was too late. The bomber had already fallen to the ground. Adjutant Nikitin moved forward to attack the enemy fighter. The enemy resisted stubbornly, and soon another 'Misaschmitt' fired machine guns at the aircraft. Nikitin fought hard, and the enemy aircraft caught fire and fell. Adjutant Krikov fought with the invaders, creating an unprecedented record. He was attacked by several enemies at the same time. Krikov shot down one enemy aircraft, and then, because he ran out of ammunition, he rammed an enemy aircraft. As a result, Krikov escaped, and the enemy aircraft fell. Some of the remaining enemy aircraft fell at our airfield."</p>
<p>Haitong News, Berlin, 23rd - German bomber fleets attacked the port of Odessa yesterday. The military facilities in the west were hit and burned, and the fire spread all over the sky. Explosions were heard from far away. Several oil pools were bombed, and the smoke filled the air.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Observers Praise Red Army Tactics</h3>
<p>Reuter's, Washington, 23rd - The reliable news about Soviet operations that has reached Washington comes from the Far East, because the only foreign soldiers allowed to inspect the Soviet front lines are Japanese military officers. The Japanese military officers' reports express deep admiration for the methods used by the Red Army, saying that the Soviet army defends its positions and only retreats when it is absolutely necessary, and that it does so in an orderly manner, and then attacks the flanks and rear of the German army. Japanese observers also praised the appropriateness of the Soviet army's actions, even though they said that Leningrad and Kyiv would be captured and the German army would eventually reach Moscow, they believed that some of the Red Army would retreat east of Moscow and continue to fight.</p>
<h3>German Army Uses Poison Gas; Soviet Union Obtains Evidence</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 23rd - On July 15, during operations west of Sitnya, our army captured secret documents and chemical equipment from the Second Battalion of the 52nd Chemical Corps of the enemy. Among the captured packages was Instruction No. ND-199, "Chemical Bomb Application Method." This instruction was issued in 1940 and was only distributed to various departments on June 11 of this year. These documents provide detailed guidance on the use of poison gas. The teaching method states that this type of chemical army must use the new No. 40 mortar and various new chemical mines. The secret German documents captured by the Red Army prove that the German army foresaw that the blitzkrieg strategy would inevitably fail and had to resort to poison gas. German troops and special units have used poison gas. Therefore, the German side has violated its own Geneva Convention signed in 1929, which was established in 1925 and prohibits all countries from using poison gas.</p>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 23rd - A German authoritative military spokesperson declared last night that the German army has broken through the Soviet defense line and reached outposts 150 miles beyond the upper reaches of the Nibel River. The German army is obviously continuing to advance eastward towards Moscow. It is learned that the German armored forces are about 125 miles to 155 miles from the Soviet capital.</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Brave Heavy Thunderstorms to Attack German Industrial Areas; British Air Force Expands Scope of Activities</h3>
<p>Reuter's, London, 23rd - The Ministry of Aviation official report said that British bombers continued to attack enemy industrial areas in the Rhine region last night in heavy thunderstorms. The main targets were still the cities of Frankfurt and Mönchengladbach. Several other industrial areas in western Germany were also bombed. Another team of British bombers raided the Dunkirk dockyard, causing great losses. All British aircraft returned to defense safely.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 23rd - Air Minister Sir Sinclair declared in the House of Commons today that the scope of activities of the British Air Force during the day and night is now expanding day by day. The evidence of the damage caused is accumulating day by day and will be published as soon as it is obtained. In addition to carrying out fierce attacks at night, the British Air Force also forces enemy aircraft to fight during the day and causes significant damage to enemy factories, transportation, and ships. What is more important is that we are now forcing the enemy to maintain a large number of air forces on the Western Front to resist our increasingly fierce attacks. Someone asked whether the British Air Force's attack was effective in supporting the Soviet Union. Sinclair replied that I think it is best not to publish the information we have obtained about the German Air Force's actions, but our Air Force's continuous attacks day and night have given the Germans a great deal of pressure, and we know that this has had a great impact on the morale of the German people.</p>

A summary of the main points is as follows: (1) The amount of savings promoted has shown a clear upward trend with each stage of the savings competition. In the first phase of this year, on January 28th, it was over 210 million yuan, increasing to over 310 million yuan by the end of April, an average increase of about 1 million yuan per day. Recent statistics at the end of June have exceeded 400 million yuan, an average increase of about 1.5 million yuan per day. Development has taken place both domestically and overseas. (2) Regarding the establishment of the savings promotion network, in addition to the 17 provincial and municipal branch committees already established, savings promotion is being carried out by provincial savings groups and overseas savings groups. Furthermore, personnel have been sent to border areas and provinces near the front lines to assess the situation and plan for the widespread establishment of more branches. At the grassroots level, over 854 city and county savings promotion branches have been established. Provincial branch committees are currently dispatching personnel to inspect and guide, and work is being earnestly promoted. (3) An example of improving savings promotion methods is the recent mobilization of the public to organize savings practice societies. The progress of savings promotion work requires cultivating both a spirit of frugality and savings habits simultaneously. Group savings require relying on the savings groups organized by institutions and organizations, and then extending them to the more dispersed general public. This led to the initiation of practice societies, so that everyone can participate. Currently, the goal is to recruit 1 million members nationwide this year, and gradually expand in stages in the future, using existing members to refer new members, which will be easier to spread to all levels of society. (4) The strength of savings promotion has been repeatedly strengthened due to the organization of savings groups and the initiation of practice societies by leaders from the party, government, military, and various sectors. Recently, the assistance provided by the three departments of the Central Organization and Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Social Affairs of the Executive Yuan's Economic Council has been even greater. Furthermore, the participation of women's work cadres in work in various places and the active development of overseas savings groups have been particularly effective in leveraging their strength among their respective target audiences. After the National Financial Conference passed a resolution to list the promotion of savings as the central task of financial authorities in various provinces and cities, the strength of savings promotion should increase even more. Overall, the success of past savings efforts is due to the widespread development achieved through the cooperation of all parties. (22nd dispatch)</p>

<p>Far East Situation Appears Tense: Japanese Ships Refuse to Publicize Sailing Schedules</p>
<p>Foreigners Traveling to Japan Face Strict Restrictions; Rumors of Japan Drafting Ship Management Plan</p>
<p>Following the frantic dumping of US dollars by Yokohama Specie Bank in Japan, it is generally speculated that Japan will undoubtedly take an adventurous action leaning towards the Axis powers in the near future, fearing that the US will freeze its funds once it is launched, so it is dumping US dollars. After this sign was discovered, the Japanese side simultaneously stopped issuing passports for foreigners to travel to Japan and announced that the Japan Mail Steamship Co. would be placed under a state of emergency, suspending the sale of passenger tickets for Japanese ships to Japan. As a result of these measures, the situation in the Far East has become increasingly tense, which should be of concern to Chinese and foreign people.</p>
<p>Adopting British Shipping Methods</p>
<p>It was learned yesterday that Japanese shipping companies have received instructions from the Japanese headquarters and authorities to stop announcing ship schedules in newspapers from yesterday (the 23rd). Japanese shipping has therefore been placed under an "emergency" status. In the future, the names of Japanese ships coming to Shanghai or exporting will no longer be specified, and only the approximate schedules of the ships will be announced.</p>
<p>Original Schedules to Be Changed</p>
<p>Personnel from major Japanese shipping companies in Shanghai, including Japan Mail Steamship Co. and Dalian Steamship Co., confirmed this information yesterday, stating that the previous practice of announcing ship schedules in newspapers every day will be changed. The reasons for this change are unknown, and it is only known that this step was taken based on instructions from the transportation headquarters and Japanese authorities. According to an employee of a Japanese shipping company, the reason for this change is unclear, but it is expected to return to normal within a few days.</p>
<p>Foreigners Must Obtain Approval to Travel to Japan</p>
<p>Foreigners who purchase tickets to Japan from Japanese shipping companies must have the approval of the Japanese consulate here, otherwise they will no longer be able to purchase tickets. According to reliable sources, foreigners in Shanghai who intend to travel to Japan will not be able to obtain approval from the Japanese consulate until next week. The Japanese authorities have not explained the reason for this. Officials at the Japanese consulate did not issue any official statements when questioned by reporters, but it is reliably known that since the beginning of this week, foreigners seeking approval from the Japanese consulate to travel to Japan have not been successful.</p>
<p>Japan to Control All Ships</p>
<p>A Tokyo dispatch from the Allied News Agency on the 23rd reported that, according to reliable sources, the Japanese government, in order to deal with the ship situation, will stipulate that private ships will be subject to state management. This plan is being drafted by the Shipping Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, stipulating that the government will lease all ships to be operated by certain shipping companies, navigating on routes designated by the government, and giving priority to the country's urgent needs.</p>
<p>Suppressing Grain Prices: Effective Government Sanctions</p>
<p>Plan to Formulate Monthly Price Stabilization Measures Covering Materials, Wages, Transportation, and Finance</p>
<p>The government authorities of our country are deeply concerned about the rise and fall of grain prices in various places. It is generally believed that the frequent rise in grain prices is due to the fact that land and water transportation are not smooth, and goods cannot be transferred and adjusted to each other. On the other hand, it is due to the fact that unscrupulous merchants, blinded by profit, are taking advantage of the situation, resulting in illegal transactions becoming increasingly rampant. It is believed that the spiraling rise in grain prices not only affects the livelihood of civilians and social security, but also hinders established national policies. The government authorities previously ordered the Economic Council of the Executive Yuan to formulate a four-month plan to stabilize prices, which has now begun to be implemented. The content is divided into four parts: materials, wages, transportation, and finance, with the relevant responsible agencies cooperating to complete the work gradually before the end of October. Therefore, speculative merchants in various industries, if they do not wake up again, will quickly release their stockpiled goods gradually, and will subsequently suffer serious losses and blows.</p>
<p>Zhen Zuobi's Astrology Lecture: A Brief Explanation of Leap Months and Leap Years</p>
<p>I have perused ancient and modern calendars and respectfully studied Western translations. I have learned that both Chinese and foreign lunar and solar calendars have intercalation. The only difference is that the lunar calendar has leap months, and the solar calendar has leap years. However, the intercalation methods of the two calendars have mutual bases. Those who specialize in using the lunar calendar as a standard are making superficial statements. The calendars of various countries are based on two points: one is to record the year, and the other is to tell the time. Recording the year is determined according to the needs of the times and is occasionally reformed. Telling the time means that the alternation of spring and autumn is constant and unchanging throughout history. Astrologers belong to the latter, so they are not bound by lunar leap months or solar leap years. They can both evolve into stems and branches.</p>
<p>The lunar calendar has been used in our country since the time of Emperor Xuanyuan. "Zhen Zuobi examines that Xuanyuan ordered the historian Rongcheng to create the calendar." It was rectified during the Xia Dynasty. During the Zhou and Qin dynasties, some used the Jianzi and Jianchou months instead of the Jianyin month as the first month of the year. This is what the previous article referred to as the evolution of recording the year, which has nothing to do with solar terms. The lunar calendar's intercalation method is based on the dark, new, waxing, and full moons. The moon is called dark when it disappears. The moon is called new when it reappears. The waxing and waning phases of the moon regulate its roundness. The moon is opposite the sun when it is full. Generally, the distance between new moons is 29 and a half days. Therefore, a large month has 30 days, and a small month has 29 days. The average is 354 days per year. Adding the odd number, there is a difference of about 11 days per year. By the third year, a leap month must be added. Two leap months are added every five years, still based on this.</p>
<p>The solar calendar originated in Egypt. At first, no intercalation was performed, so the seasons were disordered. When Gregory reformed the calendar, he established an intercalation system. The solar calendar currently used worldwide is the Gregorian calendar. Its method is based on the Earth revolving around the sun for 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes, and 9 seconds per year. However, when calculated based on solar terms, the distance between vernal equinoxes differs by 20 minutes and 20 seconds each year. The difference accumulates for four years to become a leap day "weak." Although a leap day is added every four years, it is still not enough. Therefore, one leap day must be omitted every 100 years. The fourth 100 years "strong" does not omit it. After 800 leap days, there must be a one-day difference in 3,000 years. Therefore, world calendar scholars believe that the current Gregorian calendar is still not perfect and are thinking of reforming it.</p>
<p>My humble opinion is that no matter how advanced the lunar and solar calendar methods are, although they differ in recording the year and intercalating, they are the same in telling the time and determining solar terms. For example, the Japanese calendar New Year's Day is printed in our newspaper's advertisement column. On the occasion of this leap month, I am restating the outline.</p>

<p>Japanese Military Spokesman's Defense</p>
<p>Boasting That Military Resources Have Not Been Exhausted, Ambiguous About the Strength of the Invasion of China</p>
<p>According to the Zi Lin Western Newspaper, yesterday (the 22nd), Japanese military spokesman Kunio Akiyama claimed at a reception for reporters that the German invasion of the Soviet Union was the same as the Japanese invasion of China, but the Japanese military force in China was only one-sixth or one-seventh of the Nazi force that entered the Soviet Union. He therefore admitted that the Japanese military would transfer reserve troops to cope with the new situation, using this as an analogy to boast that Japan's military resources had not "dried up." At this point, a reporter asked Akiyama why he mentioned the German invasion of the Soviet Union and whether there was a special reason. He claimed that it was because there were many similarities between the two. When asked how many troops the Germans had in the invasion of the Soviet Union, the spokesman evaded the question, claiming that he did not know. Someone then stood up and asked how it was known that the Japanese military force in China was only one-sixth of the German force attacking the Soviet Union. Akiyama smiled and said that he only knew the approximate size of the German force, so he was speaking approximately about the size of the two forces. A reporter then mustered his spirit again and continued to ask what Akiyama knew about the general estimate. The spokesman said that he could not provide this general estimate, and this question came to an end. Akiyama also replied to another reporter's inquiry that the British army in Malaya would not enter Vietnam.</p>
<p>A Foreign Passenger on a China National Aviation Corporation Flight: A Letter Describing a Thrilling Experience</p>
<p>More Than 200 Bombs Dropped by Japanese Planes, Yet the Fuselage of the China National Aviation Corporation Plane Remained Intact</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Newspaper reported that a China National Aviation Corporation plane was bombed by Japanese planes near Xufu, Sichuan on May 20th. At the time, three American passengers and many other passengers on the plane had escaped and were unharmed. One of the passengers recently sent a letter to a foreigner in Shanghai describing the details of the bombing, stating that the China National Aviation Corporation plane was a Douglas DC-2 passenger plane flying from Chongqing to Chengdu. En route, it encountered Japanese planes. The pilot immediately landed the plane, but it was still discovered by the Japanese planes, which then indiscriminately dropped bombs on the landing site, no less than 212 bombs. One bomb hit the right wing of the China National Aviation Corporation plane. Fortunately, all the passengers had left the plane and fled into the mountains. Subsequently, a rescue plane was dispatched from Hong Kong to carry the passengers to their destination. A portion of the letter is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Heard Alarm Mid-Flight and Landed in Xufu</p>
<p>We departed at 9:30 AM and had only been flying for 12 minutes when Chongqing issued an air raid alert. We heard on the radio that six squadrons of Japanese planes were approaching, four of which were flying towards our plane. Our plane changed course, and an hour and a half later, flew to Xufu and landed. We left the plane and sat down to wait for further news. News quickly arrived that Japanese planes were flying directly towards our plane. The passengers and crew left the airport and fled into the mountains. Soon after, 26 Japanese planes arrived. We held our breath and waited for the unavoidable to happen.</p>
<p>Pigs, Sheep, and Chickens Were Bombed to Death</p>
<p>Japanese planes dropped 212 bombs near us. The explosive force was terrifying, and the aftershocks almost lifted us off the ground. The right wing of the China National Aviation Corporation plane was penetrated by a bomb. Dozens of bombs fell around the plane, but the fuselage did not catch fire, which was also miraculous. We did not have time to retrieve our luggage, which was all left on the plane. Fortunately, there were no losses, which was quite gratifying. The soil and stones were bombed and fell on the foothills. No one was injured or killed, but two pigs, two sheep, and several chickens were bombed to death.</p>
<p>Spent a Night in a Hotel and Flew to Chengdu the Next Morning</p>
<p>We then saw the car oil tank near the plane catch fire and thought the plane would be burned, but the flames did not spread to the plane. A nearby house and barracks also caught fire and were being extinguished. We found an inn half a mile away, had dinner, took a bath, and had mosquito nets, so we spent the night there. The next morning, a plane flew from Hong Kong, and we boarded the plane and flew away from Xufu amidst the air raid sirens, arriving safely in Chengdu.</p>
<p>Zhu Xiaochun Leaves Shanghai for Chongqing</p>
<p>Zhu Xiaochun, a professor and director of training at Shanghai Law College, is strict and upright in his training of students, and has gained a reputation since taking office. Unexpectedly, this attracted attention, and Zhu left Shanghai for Chongqing a few days ago due to the deteriorating environment.</p>
<p>Smooth Transportation Between Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Rangoon</p>
<p>Rangoon is a Transit Point for the Yunnan-Burma Road; Passengers and Goods Transferred to Free Areas</p>
<p>The Yunnan-Burma Road is China's only international transportation line. The highway has been improved and is unobstructed, and the railway is under active construction and will soon be open to traffic. Goods imported from Shanghai and Hong Kong to China's free areas, as well as passengers traveling to the southwest and northwest, all use Rangoon, Burma as a transit point. In addition to dispatching special ships to sail the Shanghai-Hong Kong-Rangoon line, various shipping companies have many ships sailing from Hong Kong to Rangoon. The congestion of cargo and passenger transport is the highest of all routes. The prices of passenger and cargo ships between Hong Kong and Rangoon are listed below:</p>
<p>Passenger Tickets:</p>
<p>Passenger ships sailing from Hong Kong to Rangoon: (1) Dodwell &amp; Co.'s "Hai Hing" and "Hai Li" ships, first class: 14 British pounds, second class: 18 and a half British pounds, steerage: 86 Hong Kong dollars; (2) Wo Fung Co.'s "Fung Hing" ship, first class: 24 British pounds, second class: 18 British pounds, steerage: 86 Hong Kong dollars; (3) Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s "Hai Cheng" ship, first class: 24 British pounds, second class: 240 Hong Kong dollars; (4) Seng Kee Co.'s "New Hai Men" ship, grand dining room: 400 Hong Kong dollars, Chinese first class: 240 Hong Kong dollars.</p>
<p>Cargo Transportation:</p>
<p>There are many cargo ships from Hong Kong to Rangoon from companies such as Macleod &amp; Co., Wilson &amp; Co., Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., Wah Luen Trading Co., Jiangnan Co., and Wo Fat Seng Co., with at least one ship per week. Cargo (1) Goods packed in packages: 40 Hong Kong dollars per ton or 40 cubic feet; (2) Goods not packed in packages: 50 Hong Kong dollars per ton. Goods shipped from Shanghai to Rangoon can also be easily shipped to Hong Kong and then transferred to Rangoon.</p>
<p>Exchange Damaged Banknotes as Much as Possible</p>
<p>100-Yuan Banknotes Without Place Names: Fully Accepted in the Market</p>
<p>Various trade associations in Shanghai have noted that many merchants refuse to accept damaged legal tender and subsidiary currency notes circulating in the market. They have telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting that the Shanghai branches of the four banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China) be ordered to exchange them as much as possible to relieve the difficulties of merchants. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance has ordered the four banks to exchange them as much as possible in accordance with the "Measures for Exchanging Damaged Banknotes" established by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee. It is also heard that among the 100-yuan banknotes circulating in the city, those issued by the Bank of China are the most common, followed by the Bank of Communications, and then the Farmers Bank of China. These 100-yuan banknotes without place names are now fully accepted. Those printed with the place name Chongqing are temporarily not accepted by banks, but small money shops exchange them at a discount. It is heard that most of these 100-yuan banknotes with the place name Chongqing are transported from Ningbo.</p>
<p>Capro Arrives in Shanghai This Morning</p>
<p>The new cargo ship Capro, managed by Fulaide Foreign Company, with a deadweight of 3,127 tons, was ordered to sail to the Far East. It has departed from Los Angeles and will arrive in Shanghai this morning fully loaded with American goods. Other ships such as the Collinsworth wheel will continue to come to Shanghai. American ships will reduce the number of times they pass through Japan, as the American authorities believe that in the current war situation, Americans refuse to buy Japanese goods, and the transportation of American goods to Japan has also decreased, so there is no need to sail back and forth between them.</p>
<p>Public Works Department American Rice: Another 10,000 Bags Arrive</p>
<p>The Price of Flat-Priced Rice Will Return to Its Original Price</p>
<p>Since the Public Works Department purchased and sold American rice at flat prices, the market price of rice in the city has become increasingly stable. Speculative rice merchants have no way to manipulate prices. Recently, the American rice purchased by the department has been arriving one after another. Yesterday morning, the Taikoo Company's Yuezhou wheel transported another 10,000 bags of American rice from Hong Kong and is now moored at the Bund Wharf in the French Concession. According to news from the rice market, the market price of small ground rice has fallen back to 103-104 yuan. The Public Works Department's selling price of American rice is likely to fall back to the original price of 110 yuan soon.</p>
<p>Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund: Registration Begins Today</p>
<p>Students from All Levels of Poor Families Can Apply; Total Donations Have Reached Nearly 10,000 Gold</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 12th day of the micro-fundraising for the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund, and the amount of donations from all walks of life reached more than 1,800 yuan, which is the highest record since the beginning. Among them, the most active promoter is Mr. Huang Yuzhai from the financial community, who is charitable and enthusiastic about public welfare, which is admirable. Since Mr. Huang wrote an article advising relatives and friends to donate a few days ago, donations have been coming in one after another. Yesterday, Mr. Huang raised 1,000 yuan from the Yan brothers and Mr. Pei Yunqing, a senior in the Qian industry, responded to Mr. Huang's call and donated 100 yuan. This newspaper has decided to start registration today. Students from various large, medium, and small schools who are from poor families and have no ability to continue their studies, but whose academic achievements in important subjects are above 80 points and whose overall average is above 70 points, and whose conduct is above Grade B, can come to the office to apply. Those who do not meet the requirements should not bother trying.</p>
<p>Highest Donation Record Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Huang Yuzhai and Mr. Cheng Zhiliang raised 200 yuan from Yan Zhong and Yan Bolin, 300 yuan from Mr. Yan Jilin, 200 yuan from Mr. Yan Zhonglin, 100 yuan from Cheng Zhiliang, 350 yuan from Mr. Zhou and Mr. Zhu, 126 yuan and 9 jiao from the members of the Entertainment Group of the Customs Club, 100 yuan from Pei Yunqing, 100 yuan from Tu Qihua of the International Sanatorium, 100 yuan from Cai Dachuan, 50 yuan from Li Shiyuan, 20 yuan from the students of Zhengzhong Women's Middle School, 5 yuan from an anonymous person, 3 yuan from an anonymous person, 2 yuan from Zhao Zhensheng, 2 yuan from Liu Kunxi, for a total of 1,884 yuan and 9 jiao. Previously, 7,299 yuan, 5 jiao, and 2 fen were saved, for a total of 9,184 yuan, 4 jiao, and 2 fen.</p>
<p>Accumulate Virtue for Future Generations and Cultivate National Strength</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng Zhiliang, Director of the Trust Department of Huizhong Bank, wrote a letter saying, "I was an orphan since childhood and was raised by society. I am able to stand on my own in society today. Whenever I think of this, I always think of repaying society. Therefore, I have been working and running around for various public welfare organizations for several years, driven by my conscience and not daring to slack off. Now I see that your newspaper is organizing a scholarship fund for readers, and I am very impressed by the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life. With the general manager of our bank, Mr. Huang Yuzhai, contributing a huge amount of money to advocate for it, I am even more personally inspired. Therefore, I told the Yan brothers about this matter, and they generously donated 900 yuan in total, with the aim of nurturing talents. I will contribute 100 yuan from my savings to make up a total of 1,000 yuan. (Omitted) In the future, I am willing to continue to solicit donations from friends during my spare time, and I will send them to you when I have achieved something. I believe that Shanghai is a major commercial port and is not lacking in wealthy people. If everyone can do their best to benefit young people who have dropped out of school, it will not only accumulate virtue for future generations, but also cultivate national strength, which is of no small importance."</p>
<p>Free Treatment for Neurasthenia</p>
<p>Mr. Tu Qihua wrote a letter saying, "Your newspaper's publication of the reader's scholarship fund is admirable. I recently read Mr. Huang Yuzhai's sincere letter to relatives and friends, and I was deeply moved. I am a doctor and can barely make ends meet. Now I respectfully save on wasteful expenses and donate 100 yuan to show my support. Thinking of the students who are poor and study harder every day, and those who suffer from neurasthenia, there are quite a few. I am willing to have the International Sanatorium, which I run, provide free examination and treatment for these students who receive your newspaper's scholarship fund, as a special treatment, but it must be introduced by your newspaper, limited to 50 people for the time being."</p>
<p>Zhengzhong Women's Middle School Responds to the Righteous Deed</p>
<p>Representatives of the students of Zhengzhong Women's Middle School, located at the intersection of Avenel Road and Datong Road, sent 20 yuan in national currency yesterday, saying that they are now mobilizing their classmates to persuade their relatives and friends to donate to your newspaper's scholarship fund to benefit young people. Since its establishment, the school has been known for its serious teaching and practical standards. Now, it is also responding to this newspaper's scholarship fund, which is enough to show the school's educational facilities and policies, which are to cultivate outstanding talents who can adapt to the new era, which is worthy of praise.</p>
<p>Lixing Tobacco Company Temporarily Suspends Production</p>
<p>Workers Demand Maintenance Fees; Negotiations Between the Two Sides Fail to Reach Agreement</p>
<p>The Huacheng Tobacco Company's manufacturing plant in Shanghai, formerly located on Huishan Road in Hongkou, was destroyed by the August 13th artillery fire. All the company's products, such as Golden Mouse and Beautiful brand cigarettes, were manufactured by Lixing Tobacco Company at 1022 Peng Road. Lixing Tobacco Company was founded by Bao Gengsheng from Ningbo. In addition to manufacturing cigarettes for other companies, it does not have products sold on the market. It employs more than 600 male and female workers, about half of whom, about 300, are former workers of Huacheng Tobacco Company. Recently, Huacheng Tobacco Company has established a new factory at the intersection of Gordon Road and Changping Road, and it is heard that it has started manufacturing cigarettes. All the former workers of Huacheng have been rehired by the factory. Lixing Tobacco Company has to temporarily suspend work because Huacheng has set up its own factory. It plans to launch new brand cigarettes for sale and will resume work once preparations are complete. However, the approximately 300 workers employed by Hexing Tobacco Company were extremely alarmed when they heard this news. Because at a time when prices are high, the factory's closure means that workers will not be able to maintain their livelihoods. Yesterday afternoon at about 3:00 PM, representatives were sent to the company to request that each person be paid a living allowance of 60 yuan per month during the shutdown period, but the factory has only agreed to pay 30 yuan per person, which the workers said they would not accept.</p>
<p>Continued Stalemate</p>
<p>Until 9:00 PM, no solution was reached. Later, the factory, fearing an accident, called the police station, which dispatched a large number of detectives in police cars to the scene to maintain order. After the workers were persuaded by the police officers, they dispersed and will negotiate with the company again today.</p>
<p>Mallet Wheel Detained; British Consulate Negotiating with Japan</p>
<p>The Ownership of the Goods on Board Is Under Investigation</p>
<p>According to the English-language Great American Evening Post, the British wheel Haida Mallet was detained by the Japanese authorities on the grounds that it was carrying machinery belonging to Chongqing. It is heard that the British Consulate in Shanghai today (the 23rd) has begun negotiations with the Japanese naval authorities in an attempt to release the wheel. It is also heard that after detaining the Haida Mallet on Sunday afternoon, the Japanese authorities have begun investigating who owns the goods on board. Personnel from Mallet Shipping Company could not say when the wheel would be released, only saying that the British and Japanese authorities here have begun negotiations.</p>
<p>New Judge of the French Consulate: Corpein Has Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>Judge Kaufman of the French Consulate in Shanghai was recalled by the Vichy government on January 11 of this year. The vacancy was temporarily filled by French Vice Consul Gadan. Now, Corpein, the Inspector General of the Saigon Court of Appeals, has been transferred to Shanghai to serve as the judge of the French Consulate Court and arrived in Shanghai on Sunday aboard the French Post Shipping Company's Datannan wheel to take up his new post.</p>
<p>The End of the Road for Speculative Merchants: Seeking to Sell Off Large Stocks of Goods</p>
<p>The Tobacco Exchange Market Is Sluggish</p>
<p>According to those familiar with the tobacco exchange market, speculative merchants are now entrusting middlemen to sell off their stockpiles at market prices to realize cash, but buyers are generally tired and unwilling to buy high-priced stockpiles. Therefore, the sales of various daily necessities in the tobacco exchange market, such as soap, matches, kerosene, and candles, are far exceeding demand. Due to the lack of buyers, sales are sluggish. The prices of various daily necessities may continue to fall. At the same time, due to the impact of high selling prices, the general public is saving on expenses. On the contrary, various daily necessities manufacturers have increased production to ensure that there are sufficient goods on the market and to jointly stabilize the market situation.</p>
<p>The Public Works Department's New Business Tax: To Be Implemented Next Month</p>
<p>Annual Revenue May Increase by 7 Million Yuan; Autonomous Fire Has Decided to Reduce Surcharges</p>
<p>The Public Concession Public Works Department, in order to cope with a very large budget deficit this year, established a Tax System Reform Committee to study ways to increase revenue and proposed the collection of special business taxes. It is heard that the tobacco tax is one of them and was submitted for discussion at the Public Works Department meeting held at 4:30 PM yesterday. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM. It is only known that at this meeting, the case of the Autonomous Fire Company's request to reduce surcharges was approved. It is heard that the amount of the reduction is 36% and is planned to be implemented from August 1st. Regarding the case of collecting special business taxes, although the Japanese newspapers claim that the British and American sides have expressed strong opposition, it is still uncertain whether the case will be approved. However, the outcome is still unknown yesterday. It is expected that the official will issue a communiqué today. It is heard that if the case is approved, it is expected that the tax will be collected from August 1st. It is estimated that the revenue from this new tax will reach 7 million yuan per year.</p>
<p>Three Thieves Rob a Money Shop Partner; People and Stolen Goods Are Captured Together</p>
<p>One Thief Shot and Captured for Resisting Arrest; One Thief Captured Alive and Stolen Military Tickets Are Seized</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a robbery of a pedestrian with a large sum of money occurred on Guangxi Road in the bustling Public Concession. After the detectives pursued, the thief opened fire to resist arrest. As a result, one thief was injured, one thief was captured alive, and one thief escaped. The detailed situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Carrying a Large Sum of Money to Exchange Military Tickets</p>
<p>At 9:30 AM yesterday morning, Yi Tai Money Shop (specializing in buying and selling banknotes from various countries) in Room 201, 2nd Floor, Taihe Building, 81 Lloyd Road, sent its partner, Tong Qibiao from Shaoxing, carrying 330 yuan in Japanese military ticket coins in a gray canvas bag to Tai Money Shop, 595 Jiujiang Road, to exchange for 5-yuan and 10-yuan Japanese military banknotes. Because the shop refused to exchange them, Tong carried them back to the shop.</p>
<p>Three Bandits Rob Partner and Call the Police</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, three bandits were lying in ambush nearby. Seeing Tong carry the money and come out again, they immediately followed him. At the intersection of Jiujiang Road and Guangxi Road, one bandit pointed a gun to block his way and snatched all the money, carrying the loot to the west. Tong was suddenly robbed and unwilling to give up, so he shouted "Robber" from behind. Two patrolmen, No. 1920 and No. 2975, nearby heard the alarm and stepped forward to pursue. The bandits knew that things were bad, and one bandit turned around and opened fire at the patrolmen. The two patrolmen returned fire.</p>
<p>One Thief Injured and One Thief Captured Alive</p>
<p>At that time, bullets were flying and pedestrians fled in panic. As a result, one of the thieves was shot in the back and injured and fell to the ground. He was captured on the spot, and a loaded pistol and all the stolen money were seized. Another thief escaped to the entrance of the Continental Eye Hospital on Jiujiang Road and was arrested. Another thief escaped into the crowd and disappeared. After the incident, the police sent the injured thief to the hospital for treatment. According to him, his name is Wang Baohua, from Ningbo, 30 years old. The arrested thief is named Tang Jinpei, 29 years old, from Wuxi. He was taken into custody for questioning. It is learned that another escaped thief was also captured in a small hotel.</p>
<p>Breaking Up a Gang That Blackmailed Cotton Shops</p>
<p>Three Pistols Seized</p>
<p>Extortionists Zhou Zhenming, Fang Bingyan, Qin Bingjun, and others gathered many accomplices and recently organized a blackmail and extortion gang specializing in sending letters to major foreign goods and cotton shops in the concession in the city, extorting large sums of money and dividing the money among themselves. Last month, four cotton shops, including Rixin Sheng Cotton Shop, 166 Avenue Edward VII, Ri Xinzeng Cotton Shop, 114 Avenue Edward VII, Hengfeng Cotton Shop in Bazin Bridge, and Xiangyuan Cotton Shop, received threatening letters from them, demanding huge sums of money and setting a deadline for payment, otherwise they would be dealt with by different means. The cotton shops paid more than 23,000 yuan after receiving the threatening letters. A few days ago, when Zhou Zhenming and others were holding a meeting in a room on the 5th floor of the Zhongnan Hotel on Avenue Edward VII, the French police learned of it and ordered detectives to go to the address with Chinese and Western detectives from the Public Concession police to arrest Zhou Zhenming, Fang Bingyan, Qin Bingjun, and the woman Zhou Chen Liying (Zhou Zhenming's mistress), etc. According to them, three pistols and many bullets were seized from Zhou Zhenming's residence and taken to the French police station for investigation. Zhou Zhenming and others admitted to sending threatening letters to the above-mentioned merchants to extort money and dividing the 23,000 yuan among themselves. The French police are conducting a strict investigation for prosecution. (Huaguang News Agency)</p>
<p>To Prevent Cholera, Be Sure to Get Vaccinated</p>
<p>There has been a risk of cholera spreading recently. There has been an epidemic in the central slum area of the French Concession. Fortunately, prevention measures were taken immediately to avoid further spread. A person from Shaoxing came to Shanghai on the 10th of this month. He was tired from the journey and became ill after being in bed for two days. He was sent to the isolation hospital due to the epidemic. Because he had stayed in a slum beforehand, two people living with him were also infected. In addition to vaccination, the following points should be noted for preventing cholera: food hygiene, especially drinking water, must be absolutely boiled. However, according to experience, vaccination is essential. The director of the Shanghai Pasteur Institute stated in his 1940 report that vaccination is effective and for how long. The conclusion is that after vaccination, the human body has the power to resist cholera. If the injection is sufficient, it will not be infected within four months. In the next few weeks, cholera will spread, so those who have not been vaccinated must be vaccinated immediately.</p>

<h3>World Aircraft Production: Joint British and American Output Surpasses Germany's</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 23rd: An American machinery magazine contains estimates of aircraft production in various countries around the world. Germany has the highest production, but the combined output of Britain and the United States is 32% higher. Monthly production figures for each country are as follows: Germany 2,500 aircraft, Soviet Union 2,000 aircraft, Britain 1,800 aircraft, United States 1,500 aircraft, Japan 300 aircraft. Italy only produces aircraft parts. Other European countries also have some production, but it is insignificant compared to the figures above.</p>

<h3>US Under Secretary of State Discusses Post-War Peace Efforts: Offensive Armaments Must Be Abolished, Economic Benefits Should Be Equal, and the United States Will Participate in Future Political Organizations</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 23rd: Under Secretary of State Welles stated yesterday, "There can be no peace in Europe unless the Hitler government in Germany is completely eliminated."</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 23rd: Under Secretary of State Welles, speaking at the groundbreaking ceremony for the new Norwegian embassy yesterday, said that the governments of free nations and peace-loving people should now prepare for the happier days that will be found after the destruction of those who sacrifice humanity for selfish desires. The reason for the failure of the League of Nations initiated by former President Wilson was the blind selfishness of the United States and other parts of the world (referring to the US Senate's prevention of the United States from joining the League of Nations in 1920) and the use of the League of Nations by some powerful countries to pursue their political and commercial ambitions, as well as the indulgence of some powerful countries in the League of Nations Administrative Council, using it as a tool to maintain the status quo, rather than as a tool to adapt to the environment and seek peaceful and fair adjustments between countries as originally intended. When countries around the world once again undertake the great task of restoring law and order to a shattered world, they must find tools to accomplish such adjustments. Regardless of the specific structure, he believes two things must be done: first, the abolition of offensive armaments and the limitation and reduction of defensive military capabilities, accompanied by strict international supervision; second, the formulation of complete and adequate measures to ensure that the people of all countries enjoy equal economic benefits, so that a future effective and lasting peace can be established. If the people or governments of any country enjoy a monopoly on natural resources and do not allow others or other countries to share them, then the foundation for a world order based on justice and peace can never be achieved. World security represents the purpose that everyone seeks today, whether this security refers to freedom from air raids or mass destruction, or whether this security refers to each individual's right to live their life in peace and happiness. People all over the world certainly demand security and freedom from terror. This is the purpose of all of us today, which is to find a way to make it happen. He thinks that all people of goodwill will certainly be willing to make another effort to realize the great ideal of a group of nations, so as to obtain the freedom, happiness and security of all people.</p>
<h3>Two Famous American Technicians Hired to Come to China to Promote the Development of Modern Small Industries in the Free Areas of China</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency (New York Air Mail): Two famous American mechanical engineers, namely Kangdong, the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Engineering, and Cooke, a technician from the Production Administration, have been hired by the American Committee for the Promotion of Chinese Industrial Cooperation to go to China to promote the development of modern small industries in the free areas of China. According to the mission of the committee, it is to find ways to make the methods used by modern American industry suitable for the industry of free China. Therefore, it is now looking for professionals in various industries to serve directly in the interior of China. These talents must not only receive theoretical training, but also be rich in practical experience. According to Kangdong, the Massachusetts Institute of Engineering has designated Chinese industrial production issues as a special research topic for graduates. At the same time, the Pennsylvania Institute of Technology is also studying this issue under the personal guidance of President Sackett. At Columbia University in New York, the Dean of the School of Mines, Litt, is also guiding the study of Chinese industrial production issues. The results of the research will be reported to the China Industrial Cooperative Association. The total number of industrial cooperatives established in various places in the free areas of China has reached 3,000. All equipment is very standard, mostly machines moved from the occupied areas or simple manual machines. Therefore, the future of the United States to assist China in revitalizing industry is very promising. In the past two months, a large number of talents and materials have arrived in China. The Gonghe Association has also drafted a detailed plan to build foundry, steelmaking furnace and coking furnace to refine tar. In addition, it will also manufacture cement, gypsum powder, ink, bleaching powder, manufacture leather, and refine iron ore. In addition, it is hoped that it can obtain spinning machines, steel, and equipment needed for machinery factories that China needs. Although the capital of the China Industrial Cooperative Association is only US$500,000, its production volume is increasing monthly.</p>
<h3>US Uses Civil Defense Forces to Protect Naval Institutions: Senate Votes to Pass Measures to Prevent Nazi Sabotage Conspiracies</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 23rd: The US Senate yesterday passed a measure to defend US naval institutions with civil defense forces by a vote of 41 to 14. Senator Walsh, chairman of the Senate Naval Committee, said that according to secret reports from the Navy, arson and other sabotage incidents have repeatedly occurred in naval institutions in the past twelve months. San Francisco is where the headquarters of the American Nazi Party is located. Naval authorities estimate that there are no less than four hundred Nazis on the West Coast. In his opinion, if a US battleship were to be bombed due to secret sabotage, it would be very detrimental to the country. Therefore, he advocated using civil defense forces to protect naval stations.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 23rd: The US Senate yesterday unanimously passed a bill without debate, approving $545,000,000 for expenses to expand naval shipbuilding, ship repair, and gun emplacement facilities. The bill has now been sent to the White House.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 23rd: The House Naval Committee yesterday passed a bill requesting the Secretary of the Navy to extend the period of future naval recruitment in an emergency. An amendment was added to this bill to allow soldiers whose original recruitment period has expired and who re-enlist within 24 hours to receive double the reward. At the same time, a bill was also passed, ordering the Navy to use US$300 million to expand coastal facility plans.</p>
<h3>Severe Flooding in Central and Southern Japan Causes Unprecedented Damage</h3>
<p>Taiwan Public News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd: The water level of Lake Kasumigaura, six kilometers north of Tokyo, rose another four feet today. Therefore, the military authorities had to assist in the evacuation of residents in the Tsuchiura area. The Japanese Allied News Agency said that 1,200 citizens have voluntarily risen to defend against the floods, but 5,000 private houses in the city have been washed away. The City Council held an emergency meeting to discuss food supply issues and other necessary measures. All schools have been completely suspended. Tsuchiura also experienced the same flood in 1938, and residents evacuated under the same conditions. At the same time, central and southern Japan have also suffered the greatest losses in history due to the storm. Railway and highway traffic has been suspended in many places, and tens of thousands of private houses have been completely washed away. The Shimizu corner tunnel along the Tokaido line, between Hodogaya and Totsuka near Yokohama, has been interrupted due to a landslide. All vehicles have been forced to detour onto ground roads. Several low-lying areas in Tokyo have become swamps.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 23rd: Tokyo escaped the hurricane today. This morning, the hurricane swept across the mouth of Tokyo Bay and turned into the Pacific Ocean from Chiba and other places, but the rapid currents and heavy rain have flooded 76,000 houses in Tokyo. The water level of the Tamagawa River rose, so residents of Kawasaki City near it have left their homes to escape. The Meteorological Bureau announced that Tokyo received a total of 10 inches of rain in the 72 hours up to 6:00 p.m. yesterday, the second largest rainfall in 60 years. The largest rainfall was in June 1938, when it rained 11 inches.</p>
<h3>China's First Ambassador to Australia, Xu Mo, Issues a Statement, Saying that Sino-Australian Relations Are Becoming Closer</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Xu Mo, the new Chinese Ambassador to Australia, issued a statement today stating that the relationship between China and Australia will become closer due to the current situation. Xu said, "I am very honored to be appointed as China's first ambassador to Australia. The relationship between China and Australia has always been cordial, and it is now becoming closer due to the situation in the Eastern Hemisphere. The two countries are united by several relations, the most important of which is of course our common position in resisting aggression and the new order. I am extremely willing to do my best to enhance this relationship of friendship and understanding." (United Press, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Plans to Issue Grain Ration Certificates by Population: Already Printed and Will Be Distributed by the Police</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Dagong Bao reported yesterday that the government is now preparing to issue new grain ration certificates in Chongqing for the distribution of rice flour by population. These grain ration certificates have already been printed and will be distributed by the police. At the same time, Minister of Food Xu Kan reported that after the implementation of paying taxes with rice and grain, the food problem for the Chinese military and civilians next year can be solved. The government expects to obtain 50 million shi of grain by this method. Xu declared during Commemoration Week that the biggest obstacle to the government's implementation of its food program is the landlords. Landlords in Sichuan receive 60% to 73% of all grain produced, but they are still unwilling to transport it to the government. The official Central News Agency commented on Xu's speech, saying that Xu called for the Food Department's slogan of "solving tenants." The Minister of Food declared that the income of ordinary tenants is insufficient to maintain their livelihood, which greatly affects agricultural production. Xu also said, "The land policy of the Kuomintang is centered on 'those who cultivate the land own the land.' This is a prerequisite for increasing production, but it can only be completed gradually." Xu also reiterated Sun Yat-sen's legacy of increasing agricultural production by technical methods. He said that only by implementing Sun Yat-sen's legacy can China become a modern agricultural country from a primitive agricultural country. Xu also advocated that the government establish warehouses in various counties to store surplus grain for future use, and advocated banning winemaking to save grain. Xu also said that in addition to implementing the payment of money and grain with grain and rice in the second half of this year, the government has also decided to purchase grain on a large scale at officially determined prices. The Chongqing warehouse currently stores 280,000 shi of grain, so there is no shortage of grain. (United Press, 23rd)</p>

<h3>This Year's Judge Examination Establishes Registration Office: Number of Admitted Candidates Determined</h3>
<p>Chongqing: This year's Higher Examination for Judicial Officers' Preliminary Examination, Temporary Examination, and Ordinary Examination, the temporary examination is scheduled to be held simultaneously in various districts on August 18th and 26th, respectively, as previously reported in the newspaper. It is now learned that registration for the above two examinations will be open from the 1st of this month to the 5th of next month. The Examination Committee has also established a registration office to start handling registration matters. It is reported that the number of judicial officers to be admitted this year is set at 500. Since the judicial officers' expenses have been unified, the treatment of judges in various provinces is completely the same as that of central government employees, and the pre-set candidate judges will be uniformly changed to regular vacancies next year. Judges who pass this examination will have the opportunity to fill vacancies once they pass the re-examination. Since there are many places and it is easy to be admitted, many candidates from all over the country have requested registration forms from the Examination Committee. In addition, the number of people to be admitted to the ordinary examinations for court clerks, prison officers, accountants, statisticians, and land administrators is also set at 550 in total. In addition to experience qualifications, the educational qualifications for taking the exam are based on high school graduation. (Telegraph, 23rd)</p>
