<h3 id="c5">市塲的騷動 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>自從美政府有二次撤退滬僑之舉。加以紐約交易所市塲上戰事臭味濃厚，頓使上海市塲於前昨兩日發生了騷動與慌張，其實這種情况的來臨，早在意料之中。以上海的五方雜處，環境特殊，無論那一方面風吹草動，皆可使上海市塲上的人心，好像大海中孤航，發生顚播，甚至於像失了南針一般，飄泊無依，播盪不定；何况美日如果衝突，上海的地位更易使人們擔憂，蓋幕下燕巢，原來經不起狂風摧折，而現在則太平洋狂風將至。</p>
<p>市塲上最汹湧而出的，亦爲三年來最所珍貴的美匯；此非美金有甚麼動搖，乃是中國人心的轉變。惟恐美國凍結了日本資金，如果上海的尾閭不塞住，日人儘可利用中國的法幣，無限制的套進美匯，此以鄰爲壑的政策，將使美國凍結日資金的效果等於零，因之，一般人的惶恐，以爲美國亦必對中國採相當防範的措置，藉以強化日資金的凍結；在此變化難測之局面下，尤其是私有外匯，當此利害關頭，宜無怪傾筐倒篋而出，於是美匯大有與日俱長之勢。美金票更不必說，一國的紙幣，在他國境內原不便行使，無如中國人不願一切，只願慮到法幣的目前，把美鈔看作現黃金一般，紛紛收藏，乃至於用以做投機，到目下又是賣出惟恐不　。</p>
<p>當然，因美僑準備撤退，所有在華一部分得投資，如股票之類，或作相當的賣出，而跟出得自亦不少。遂致前日的外股，平均跌落百分之二十，然此乃一時的現象，風頭一過，轉瞬就會平靜的。最無謂的把公債亦是　擁賣出。雖說是公債漲勢過甚了；但是買公債究不失爲資金運用最正當的途徑，此其理由不容多述。試想投機固然可以橫財獨得，立致巨富。但是反其道而說，亦可　其所有，貧無立錐，利害得失參半，故只可謂之投機。投機之投，本爲博投（俗作骰）之投，投子所以博輸贏，投機之盈虧。正亦無異於投子之賭博，果能覺吾及此，亦可知投機的惶恐與失敗，亦正是必然的報應。公債則不然，中國戰事雖是已歷四十餘月，可是抽籤還本付息，從沒有愆過期。以中國發行的債額，遑論遠不及日本，即以中國經濟基礎言，無論日本沿海的交通，如何封鎖，及淪陷區內竹節式的統制，把各地間貨物流通，橫隔豎絕得如何嚴厲；甚而充公沒收，鞭撻凌辱，終不能消磨中國民衆潛在的彈力。做即是中國因戰事而發行新公債，然其終極，各種債券本身之價値，仍可決其顚撲不破。誠因中國政府不至使擁護公債者灰心，而長投機分子之氣燄。是以收買公債，尙不失爲以義爲利。</p>
<p>瞻顧未來，恐慌的時節正多：但要記取，上海恐慌之程度愈高，前途之光明愈快，正是相反而相成。最不應該的，是趁這人心恐慌時期負薪救火，如米商又在幸災樂禍把米糧操縱居奇了。戰事以來，物價漲得最高者，莫過於米煤麵粉，駸駸乎十倍之數。固然，不能盡責各業本身、水脚之過分高抬，原料之被封鎖亦是其－，然而米煤麵粉儘管來，存積儘管厚，可是行市依然不鬆，甚至於時局稍有風聲，怦怦上漲，是則謂非商人操奇計贏不可。要知處俶攘之世，保全利益的最好辦法，莫如適可而上。昔人有言，「螳螂只知捕蟬，而不知黃雀之在其後，」此正見其欲耽耽者，已有强敵伺之於後，何况黃雀之後，尙有童子操弓待發者在。故在同一環境同一生活之下，惟互利方是眞利，雖人以爲亂世乃是發財的機會，然財產需有合法之保障，不然，其道亦危，螳螂黃雀可爲之列。賢明之中國商人，稍從大體着想，宜無爲過分之誅求，壯一已之私私囊，能知「旣以爲人己愈有，旣以與人已愈多，一方爲亂世守富之善道了！」</p>

<h3 id="c42">日本勢力伸向泰國 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>這是紐約泰晤士報駐遠　訪員亞朋特自馬尼刺所發的無綫電報吿，茲譯錄如下：</p>
<p>星加坡官塲相信，泰國與越南的衝突、大致是被人煽動所致，俾達「鷸蚌相爭，漁翁得利」的目的。泰國如果因而准許日本利用該國空軍根據地，則在軍略上對於日本的南進政策，關係甚大，因為日本現在越南北部的空軍根據地，距離星加坡有一千英里之遙，泰國的飛機塲與之相距只不過四百英里，如此進展，則日本對於星加坡與英屬東印度的威脅，無形中就縮短六百英里了。</p>
<p>這種威脅性的計劃，已經逐漸由官方的行動和言論證實。例如去年十二月六日，日本已與泰國政府締結九年條約，規定互相尊重領土完整，並允將雙方有關各項問題，互相磋商。稍後，泰國總理兼國防外交兩部部長及海陸空軍總司令桑格朗亦聲明，該國與越南在湄公河一帶的衝突，即使圓滿解決，該國對於越南的怨仍未終了。</p>
<p>數年以來，日本與泰國互派商務，海軍及親善使節，不絕於途，日本且曾幫助泰國發展海空兩軍。去年秋，泰國向美國購買聶炸機十架，運經菲律濱時，美國政府忽下令予以扣留，日本即以同樣飛機十架贈與泰國。泰國親善使節並曾與日本秘密成交，由日本允於今春以長距離聶炸機四十架及自南寗撤退的一部份軍需，給與泰國。</p>
<p>去年十二月初，泰國舉行國慶紀念，日本政府要人特在東京廣播演說，表示慶賀。日本各報一向擁護泰國對於越南所提出的領土要求，且一再聲明，日本決不容許歐美各國對泰國施用壓力。</p>
<p>泰國排外運動大都也是受人嗾使。泰國境內約有華僑四百萬名，他們在商界和金融界佔有極大勢力。泰國政府乃利用國營制度，剝奪他們的經濟力，沒收他們的產業。泰國政府某要人近曾當衆宣佈，「泰國對付華僑應與德國對付猶太人一般」但華僑的潛勢力仍舊很大，能使日本發展貿易計劃，遭受挫折。</p>
<p>數年前，泰國且曾逼迫英美煤油廠，但原沒供給，時斷時續，且不能鍊製特種飛機油。及至歐戰爆發，該國已購進大量飛機用油，存貯待用。</p>
<p>泰國兵力，以空軍實力最强，海軍則不堪一擊。陸軍人數較多，配備亦較精良，以東方標準而論，堪稱二等軍。日本公使館，海陸軍武官特別多，一般人認為泰國海陸軍顧問。</p>

<p>本埠美總領署、自於前日重申勸告美籍婦孺及必需留滬之美僑、自上海迅速撤退後、昨日本埠社會中外各界對此消息、均極關切、本報記者昨特詢問本市美商最大航業機關、據稱昨日預定赴美艙位者、確較平素為多、最近自滬赴美之郵船、為二月二十五日之柯立芝總統輪、其給位聞已大半預定、於此可見美僑重視美領之勸告矣、聞最短期內、滬上美僑可撤退者、約有五百人左右、</p>
<p>通知純係勸告性質</p>
<p>平明社記者昨向美領署方面、提出若干問題、當據發言人答稱、此次所發重申撤僑通知、乃係一種勸告、並非槪令撤退、不過希望無留滬必要之美僑、還以撤退為宜、現本埠美領署所管轄之美國僑民、除本埠外、尚有若干就近外埠之美僑、亦歸滬領署管轄、總數大槪有婦孺一千五百名、男子一千餘名、總共約二千數百名、</p>
<p>防軍駐滬並未調移</p>
<p>自美領署重申勸告撤僑後、於是本埠又盛傳美國駐滬防軍麥令斯隊、亦有考慮撤退之謠、記者特以此相詢、據稱、駐滬美防軍考慮撤退、領署方面未有所知、或以據報載有小部份瓜代之誤、至於美僑之接受勸告而自動撤退者、政府方面、並不準備派專輪接運、不過勸告於此運輸便利之際、及早撤離耳、</p>
<p>最近返美約五百人</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、昨據本埠美總領館一職員云僑居該館管轄區內之美國人民、奉美國務院通告勸令撤退後、昨尚未能決定行止、蓋因大部分美僑、多不能擔負川資之鉅款也、至上次國務院通令後、已撤回美國者、約有一千六百人、大都均婦女兒童、現時居留上海之美僑、約尚有二千八百人、其中能於近期內返美者、不過五百人左右、</p>
<p>警告日本意義重大</p>
<p>英文大美晚報、昨日著文評論美駐滬總領事館頒發通告、重申勸告美籍婦孺及無必要留滬之美僑返國一事、略稱、美駐滬總領事館此舉、表示「山　大叔非好開頑笑之輩、」就通告所　、「此項勸告、係為美國國民本身及國家之安全與便利、而採取此必要之預防手段、」其意義固極明顯、以在目前形勢下、美僑個人安全、雖亦足以使美政府採取此一行動、然我人　寗視其主要原因為基於國策、美國撤僑一事、對日特別重要、日本官塲人士當然希望將此事之嚴重性、予以減低、因深恐日本人民若知美國已在太平洋中作戰時準備、必如遭受當頭一棒、而對於軍人之造次胡為、勢將　法加以制止、我人以為美國務院所發出之撤僑通告、除昭告美僑外、尚含有對日本人示決心之意、雖我人對此點無法證明、但我人有理由可深信之、想美僑獲讀此項勸告後、當可知其表面可含之意　為無必要覊留之美僑、應自遠東撤退、通告稱「今國務院已不擬遣派專輪前來、協助撤退、足證尚無「十萬火急」迅速完成此舉之意、該報　勸告留滬美僑、勿輕易放棄其在此間所應負擔之責任稱、不得不留於此間之美僑、在美國未參戰前、應具有決心、為其權利與財產而始終奮鬥、以領事館之勸告、祗為重申前此之勸告、並無將已往之政策、予以擴大之意、故我人認為大局、尚無多大變化、云（按昨日字林西報記載、查美國國務院曾於去歲十月份勸告無必要留此之美僑自遠東撤退、當時曾有美僑一千五百人、乘美政府三特遣之專船蒙德萊號、馬列波　號及華盛頓號自遠東撤退、尚有少數美僑、則乘日輪返國云）</p>

<p>本報出版之歐戰實錄，內容異常豐富，二百餘葉都二十萬言。所收各篇，均首尾完整，一氣呵成，讀之趣味濃厚，增益知識，爲留心國際時事者所必備。卷首序言，　舉此書刊行之旨趣，內容搜羅之廣泛，編譯工作經過之艱鉅等等言之綦詳。茲載原序如下：</p>
<p>「納粹德意志何興之暴？謂曠古未有可也。一九一四迄一九一八年之戰，彼以戎首而敗於聯軍，國力旣敝，和約復梏桎之，剝削之，無所不用其極。喪歐陸領土二萬七千餘方英里，幷海外全部殖民地；賠款約合美金三百三十萬萬（33，000，000，000，00）圓，商船儘供抵償，產煤先資他國者十年，鐵道車頭五千輛，又客貨車十五萬輛，暨所存軍用品，盡獻聯軍；經濟有關之若干重要管理權交由國聯掌握；自此萊茵河畔，不得設防，編練陸軍限額十萬，空軍禁絕，軍艦胥自沉海底。河山破碎，不但割地，東普魯士省且與其本部裂爲二橛而環繞之者，旣有戰時對抗諸强如法蘭西義大利，更有戰後新立羣小，如立陶宛波蘭、捷克斯拉夫、匈牙利，皆英法所扶翼，鷹犬不啻也。總之，德國當時雖米滅亡，然和約條款，實使德人子子孫孫淪於牛馬生涯而猶必不堪負荷，更遑論圖强爭覇。和之後，和約條款雖未盡執行，然旣民生憔悴，政變頻仍，國是陷於風雨飄搖中者十餘年。希特勒之率納粹黨徒而秉政，猶一九三三年事耳。生聚敎訓，發揚蹈厲於是而頭角崢嶸；兼併奧大利，陳師萊茵河，於是而國際敬憚；索米默爾，則立陶宛拱手以奉；先之以巧取蘇台德區，繼之以鯨呑捷克斯拉夫，則英法俯首而爲之虎倀，於是而光燄萬丈。凡此擴展，兵木血刃；因國際矛盾予以可乘之機，亦因國力猛晋始得不戰而克。故於其不得不以戰爭爲工具之日，一舉而束滅波蘭，北取丹麥挪威；及揮兵西指，盧森堡、荷蘭、比利時諸國固不堪攖其鋒，彼法蘭西者，當世之一强也，夙有世界第一陸軍國家之稱，德軍臨之，乃竟如摧枯拉朽；謂非國力强健，曷克臻此？綜計自納粹當國以至對波用兵，時僅六年：自攻波以至敗法，不足一年，雖侵略不足爲訓，結局未可樂觀，然自殘破垂亡，而自力更生，而揚威域外，有如神助，抑何一而非人事；是則納粹縱使覆亡，德人所成就於六七年間者，亦旣卓絕古今，宜爲天下後世所景慕。夫人何爲而生？　何爲而立？聚訟紛紜，見殊仁智，德人與英法蓋有逈不相侔者歟？當年和約，抹然美總統威爾遜原則，惟膺懲戎首是務。德人雖創痛深鉅，旣未嘗懲前毖後而悔禍，亦不願偃武修文以苟安；却深信當年惜乎戰敗，非戰之罪，遂舉人力物力而盡納之於戰備；在彼戰備第一之信念之下，其人則無一日不在艱苦中，其國則無一日不在進步中。至於英法，苦戰獲勝，躊躇志滿，夢寐求之者，一勞永逸而已。以有國聯可操縱，遂有恃無恐於國際爭衡：有資源可壟斷，遂有恃無恐於生活壁壘：有馬奇諾防綫可扼守，遂有恃無恐於作戰，有弱小諸國族可犧牲，遂有恃無恐於綏靖；蓋自凡爾賽和約之後，以迄慕尼克協定爲止，相率浸沉於好夢。故遠東有首惡而未嘗嫉惡如仇，歐陸有隱患而未嘗防患未然；以九一八侵略警報之悽厲，更傳染而至非洲，而至歐洲，相繼吿警而舉不足以警覺之。徒知詛咒戰爭之殺戮破壞，乃以因循妥協爲得計；殊不知惟有尊重國際之公道正義，始爲長治么安之達道；見義勇爲而舍生取義，當仁不讓而殺身成仁，戰爭蓋自有不容已者焉。薄此不爲，豈但獎惡，且噬臍而莫及。納粹在國際之啟釁，雖猶爲去年事，彼在國內之得勢，則後於九一八事變者兩年；種因不一，然英法所　種之國際空氣實助長納粹政治之成功。及瞿然於猛虎出柙，戰備旣相形見絀；年餘以來之慘劇，蓋由夾有自。因果不爽，可不哀哉？慘劇之中，法國最慘，然在貝當乞和之前夕，誰料及此。及梵遞爾宜吿乞和，所予世人印象：或以爲德國國力之强，有類超人，國家政制其惟效法納粹，人類運命其惟屈膝納粹，而希特勒殆擁有主宰人類之宿命；或以法國以者侈淫靡之夜巴黎立國，其人民盡是紈袴子弟，雖有卓越之政治家軍略家盡智竭忠，而仍回天乏術；或以爲英國負義背信，任令友邦獨當苦難，坐視不救，以迄覆亡；或以爲蘇聯傾誠竭力，爲德後盾，而美國則自始無愛於英法，隔岸觀火，是爲決定戰局之因素；或以爲勝敗判決於戰略，戰略失着於偶然，德勝法敗，偶然而已。凡此印象，曖昧而矛盾：然而法國慘敗之出乎舉世意料之外，則似乎非將曖昧與矛盾雜揉爲一，竟無法爲之解釋者。嗚呼，戰爭大事也，盛衰興亡大變也，以歷史之莊嚴，詎有曖昧矛盾之一頁哉！申報以注重國際問題爲編輯方針之一，平時對海外消息蒐集甚廣而抉擇甚謹·此次歐戰爆發，憾電訊之徒爲無數片段，徒述表面演變，　富矣，捷速矣，然歐戰之全貌如何，內幕如何，靜態之基調如何，活躍之人事如何，遠因近果，去跡來踪又如何？交戰國外，與戰局有密切關係諸國之影響及其感應又如何？深知讀者必不以僅得電訊而遽滿求知之欲，復念報章亦不以僅載電訊爲旣盡耳目之長。愛多方搜羅歐美報紙雜誌，就有關歐戰之著述，擇其作者不以宜傳爲務，而於此戰之軍事政治外交種種方面，或身歷其境，或躬與其役，其言皆可徵信，其事未經人道，且非其人不能道其事，而所道又爲關心世變之人士所亟欲洞悉者，由申報同人，分任迻譯，相繼刋之報端。日積月累，質量皆有可觀；綜其內容，有如連珠，自成系統，非惟足以解答德國何以興，法國何以敗之絕大疑問而巳，蓋多方面之現代史料也。讀者稱許之，更不以陸續披覽爲旣足，函牘粉沓，敦促彙刋；文自可傳，義不容辭；迄本年十一月爲止，輯三十篇爲一卷，稱歐戰實錄。其時，德國閃電戰術之對英無效，固已顯見，然德機方空襲英倫不輟，歐戰猶在延擴之中；此卷而後，必有續錄。抑安得公道仲張，天心悔禍，無待三錄四錄乎？潘公弼序於知止樓。</p>

<h3 id="c89">容經理 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— 水冗</p>
<p>算起來，我和容經理是近親。可是我不大去親近他。我不喜歡有錢人的那副神氣。還有，他們的獨特的思想」。不過我跟他的獨子覺民却熟得很，那完全是因爲我們都是牛靑人，而且志趣父相同的緣故。</p>
<p>我見過好多父與子的衝突。（那顯得多麼小可避免啊！）在容氏父子中間，我也看釗了這衝突。兒子顯然不直父親的行爲，隨時隨地採取着一種戰門的，不妥恊的態度·於是做父親的，好像一隻門敗的公雞，那麼寂寞地撫摸着一顆受了傷的心。</p>
<p>對我，「覺民」很少提到他的父親。只有一次，他忽然沮喪地，幾乎自言自語地說：「父親弄了一個小的。」</p>
<p>「你的母親不知道嗎？」我聽人說過他的母親是有名的河東獅。</p>
<p>他搖搖頭·「秘密的」。</p>
<p>在我們幾個朋友中，有一個異性叫沈慧的。那是一個很可愛的女孩子。因爲同學的關係，她常和覺民在一起。漸漸兩個戀愛起來了。沈慧去過容府好多次·也許是由於「舐犢情深」吧，覺民的母親見了沈慧，一下子就瞧卜了。但是，容經理，在多方探聽之後，這回竟然例外地違抗「閫令」，竭力反對。</p>
<p>一天，他突然差人把我「請」了去。「我實在想不出別人一，他說，遞給我一枝烟·「只有你可以勸勸他。他比較要聽你的話。天下無不是的父母！那個女的，根本家庭就成問題，何况本人又是那麽輕佻！本來已有和發洋行的陳大班挽人來說親了，他的第三個女公子。照片也拿來了，面貌並不壞。我不是貪嫁妝，總得「門當戶對」，是小是：我只有一個空塲面，外强中乾；將來「百年J之後，覺民也有一個倚靠。「人望高如，水望低頭」，我對覺民說，不妨先訂婚，訂了婚就可以通通信，走動走動，可是他不答應」！</p>
<p>一話是不錯」。我吐出了一口靑色的燜，囁嚅着。「不過，我以爲做父母的，對於兒女的婚事不讓他們自主，未免太那個，太傻了。好，是應該的；不好，那罪名可實在！」</p>
<p>一這是你還沒做人的父母呀！」說着，他笑起來·接着，用厚嘴俘怪響的呷了幾口鮮石斛的煎茶·「我們覺民什麼都好，讀書用功，也做人家；只是有一樣：老是悶聲不　」接着又說了一大堆責備的話。</p>
<p>我默默地抽着烟。他有意在敎訓我，但是我不反駁，我相信聖蒲孚的「沉默是最高的輕蔑」那句話。</p>
<p>過了一些日子，我又被「請」了去，這回他頹然倒在一隻沙發上，兩條粗眉毛緊結在一起。他的一雙灰色的眼睛，黯然地望着我，右手哆嗦的交給我一張紙。「你看，有道樣的事！我做夢也想不到的！怎麽辦呢？也許他還在上海，他身邊沒有錢怎麼走得了？眞是做夢也想不到的」！</p>
<p>我讀着那封信。那淸秀的字跡是我熟識的。事實上，我讀那樣的信不只一次了。這常常被利用來作父，子衝突的結束的！</p>
<p>「會不會爲了那樁婚事？</p>
<p>我搖搖頭。終於建議「登報招尋」。他叫我替他　好稿。自然，結果，是在意料中的</p>
<p>前天，我在街上遇到他。背後跟着　個高個子的　宋保鑣。容經理微笑地拉着我的手：「好久不見了。告訴你，我接到他的來信了！覺民的！是山淪陷區遞來的。他現在在河北遊　隊裏。他要我寄一點錢去。你看，救國還要自己挖腰包！這次他到那裏去，沿途是用的同去的朋友的錢。唉，眞是很難理解的事！我預備匯二百元錢去，還打算寫封信　他。我說只要他回來，什麼都可以商量，譬如？那椿婚事！「你想他會回來嗎？」</p>

<p>馬廳長的心上，頓時覺得一冷。</p>
<p>「那末就請姑娘去跟她父親說好不好？」馬夫人很熱心地建議着。</p>
<p>「這…這可有些不便吧！」侯校長是個老處女，對於男女的界限，不免還是看得很重。</p>
<p>「她沒有母親嗎？馬廳長捻着小鬍子問。</p>
<p>「是一個不能行動的癱子。」侯校長很感慨地說：「論起實情來，她家的確很可憐，要是不讓湘綺嫁一個有錢的丈夫，簡直混不下去。」</p>
<p>「所以說，我們也不專爲自己，一半也是爲了她！」馬廳長悲天憫人地說。</p>
<p>「那末請她父親到學堂裏去談談行不行呢？耍是姑娘一個人不願意，反正我是整天空着的，就讓我來伴你怎……？」</p>
<p>「慢些！馬廳長突然打斷了他妻子的話。「你去有什麼用？我倒想出一偭計較來了！只要表姐先寫信去，把這位老先生約到學堂裏來，一切話都可以讓我跟他說；而且我相信一定有方法可以敎他答應的！」</p>
<p>侯校長低下頭，默默地想了好一會。</p>
<p>「這樣辦自然是好的。可是在袁鎭守使那一方面，你也得跟他們說一個定當，吿訴他們聘禮是不能不從豐的，而且將來結婚之後，羅家的生活，都得由他担任！。這樣我們對於湘綺，才不失爲是一片好心。」</p>
<p>隔了三天，羅老先生便當眞應着侯校長的約會，上省立女師來，跟馬廳長侯校長兩人足足談判了九十多分鐘。</p>
<p>其時羅湘綺已從畢校裏搬回家裹去了，侯校長寫給她父親的信上，雖沒有寫出爲着什麼事情，但道是不難猜想的，因爲湘綺也知道她父親曾經爲了自己的出路求過侯校長，那末侯校長的來信約談，照她的估計，當然也總是爲着職業問題的緣故。（三一）</p>

<h3 id="c92">鼓無人的詩 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— 嵐酼</p>
<p>四年前的夏天，我到也在牯嶺避暑的王老伯家去玩，不幸便得到我的乾姐姐，他的女兒的死耗。王老伯含着眼淚，給一封信我說，這是若姊生前從協和醫院寄來，囑他無論如何要親自交給我的。信中便抄着下面這首詩的原文，叫我永速快樂，永遠勇敢，永遠不灰心，叫我有機會再到北平—我的生地，她的死地，去，在她墓前念給她聽。</p>
<p>那年我從牯嶺回到上海後，生了很重的一塲病，病中得這詩的安慰不少。這詩後來還使我在學校裹考過第一名。以前，我差不多天天念着我死去的姐姐抄來的這詩，直至前年考進了「以考試出名」的大學，開始一天到晚和分數搏鬥，才把信藏了起來。</p>
<p>上學期很不幸地我有三樣功課不及格，今天向功課好的兩個女同學借筆記預備補考，又碰了一個大釘子，晚上百感交集，不禁找出這詩來狂念，並動手做所謂」翻譯的工作。我相信這詩是能鼓舞我，安慰我。我希望我的譯文，也能安慰別人，因此把它發表出來：</p>
<p>假使Phoebe　Cary</p>
<p>假使你的洋娃娃頭破了，</p>
<p>我的小姑娘呀，</p>
<p>你雖哭至眼鼻通紅，能否把它弄好？</p>
<p>這樣是不是快活一點呢？</p>
<p>把這事當做一個玩笑</p>
<p>並且說你很快樂，</p>
<p>是洋娃娃的頭，而不是你的頭破了。</p>
<p>假使你穿好衣服預備散步但天忽大雨如注，</p>
<p>因爲你的縐眉叱駡，雨是否會早住？</p>
<p>這樣是不是好一點呢？</p>
<p>你還是微笑而不把嘴呶，</p>
<p>因此使屋內好像充滿了陽光，</p>
<p>雖然外面並沒有太陽·</p>
<p>假使你的功課非常困難，</p>
<p>我的男孩子呀，</p>
<p>你坐着心煩，能否稍减其艱？</p>
<p>這樣是不是聰明一點呢？</p>
<p>懇切地去工作，</p>
<p>不像一個低能兒似的等着立刻去學習它。</p>
<p>假使這世界並不使你歡喜對於人們的行爲你也不樂意，</p>
<p>但你想造物者會不會更換世界，</p>
<p>使其恰合你意？</p>
<p>這是不是一個最聰明最勇敢的辦法呢？</p>
<p>我的孩子們呀，</p>
<p>不管結果如何，</p>
<p>你總盡力去做！</p>

<p>— 唯我</p>
<p>在道百物價漲之際，說出來令人難信，角兒的包銀，竟亦飛漲數倍以上，事實是指北方伶人所謂「京角兒」而言。以往他們到上海來。向例「獅子大開口」，要巨額包銀，現在巨額包銀還要漲上好幾倍。譬如像鬚生楊寳森吧，頭一次搭黃金包銀一千五，第二次漲到兩千，第三次又漲五百，老板看他能叫座，外加掛紅五百，成三千之數。近幾年楊寳森南來，他的包銀即以此爲標準。去年他由滬北返之後，自張一軍，自挑頭牌，一登龍門，身價百倍，黃金方面想再邀他來，派人和他接洽之下，這　楊老板張嘴就要萬。他說：「隨便什麽都能講交情，吃飯不容講交情。」簡直少一文不行。此外還有坤伶侯玉蘭，現在北方是二牌旦角中最紅之一人，第一次南來包銀不到兩千，現在最少要三個兩千才肯南來。「京角兒」們的包銀，大有隨金子上漲之勢，說不定將來他們的包銀，也許會有市面，不過長此以往，上海人對「京角兒」早晚「擋駕」，總有請他們不必再來的一天。</p>
<h3 id="c94">荀慧生南來 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>四大名旦中，惟荀慧生已久未南來獻藝，算來慧生與滬人闊別已有八載之久。去歲，黃金更新兩　戲院，曾一度競邀此人但迄未成事實。現在消自傳來，慧生　應黃金之邀，將於下月初南來出演。配角方面，鬚生本爲王文源（即五齡童），但王之藝，並不可取，此間恐其不能號召，有改邀別人之意。丑角或邀其老搭擋馬富祿同來，惟小生余仲仁，與慧生拆擋已久，者番滬人將不能重見此二人合作，未免美中不足。至於座價已定爲陸兀，比上次程硯秋還要貴，此亦包銀漲價，水漲船高之道也。</p>

<p>說來也許會使環球公司老闆失笑，原來影迷們早已熟聞竇萍將有喜訊　出，一旦聽釗證實消息，莫不表示歡迎。美國有些電影院鄭　其事地宜佈竇萍和保羅訂婚的消息，觀衆報以熱烈的鼓掌。環球公司老闆聽到這　報吿，當可相信觀衆歡迎竇萍的終身有寄，而結婚決不會傷害她的前程。</p>
<p>「明星要保持銀國地位，決不能結婚」這種時代，已經過去了。竇萍雖是著名的明星，但她已是成年的姑娘，當然</p>

<h3 id="e1">Increasing Threat of Pacific Warplanes: Australia Considers Emergency Measures, Adopts Effective Steps to Actively Enhance Armaments. U.S. Government Advises Nationals to Withdraw from the Far East. <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Sydney: The Australian Privy Council received a telegram yesterday reporting on the overseas situation, abruptly adjourned the meeting, and issued a declaration saying, "This Council believes that it must clearly inform the people of its considered opinion, that the war has now entered a new stage and has reached an extremely serious degree. Based on the current situation, it can be described as extremely important. In order to take effective steps to defend Australia, the entire nation must shoulder the greatest effort it can make and strengthen its armaments." It is reported that the Australian War Cabinet will meet today to study the situation, with Sir Brooke Popham, the British Commander-in-Chief of the Far East, in attendance. (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Sydney: Today, the War Cabinet met with the Chiefs of Staff of the Navy, Army, and Air Force to discuss the international situation. It is also reported that the War Cabinet has considered a national defense program based on the telegram from Prime Minister Menzies regarding the international situation. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull stated last night that he had not received official notification of external reports of emergency situations, such as the Australian war conference and the order for Dutch ships to sail to neutral ports. (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>London: Reuters' diplomatic correspondent said that London now holds serious views regarding the Pacific situation, especially after Australia issued a warning regarding the situation in the Far East. London is greatly satisfied with the reaction of Australians upon hearing this warning, and the attitude of the United States is also very good. Allied sources in London who have good information feel that there is no immediate danger at present, as the Thai-French negotiations are underway and the ceasefire has just been extended for another week. Judging from this, Japan may not take action at this time. Although Japan has engaged in negotiations with the Soviet Union, it has not yet reached any agreement that would allow Japan to boldly advance southward. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull confirmed yesterday that the U.S. government had instructed consular officials in the Far East to renew their advice to "non-essential" American women and children to leave the region. Hull stated that the government's renewed issuance of this advice is in line with its consistent policy, as the government now believes that both Asia and Europe are in a state of disturbance. The Secretary of State also stated that this move is merely a precautionary step to ensure the safety of American citizens. (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: The U.S. Consul General has notified the 2,000 American citizens residing in Hong Kong to leave the territory and return home as soon as possible, stating that the State Department believes that a situation that urgently endangers the safety of American citizens is imminent. This notice is not intended to cause panic, but rather is due to the still unpredictable political situation in the Far East. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Beijing: Although the majority of the 470 American citizens in Beijing take the recent evacuation advice issued by the U.S. Consulate seriously, few have gone to travel agencies to process return-home procedures. Most American citizens have stated that although they have received evacuation advice, they still lack the savings to leave. A small number of American citizens have stated that they will leave as soon as the opportunity arises. (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington: Since the State Department recently advised American citizens in the Far East to retreat home, the U.S. government's preparations for Far Eastern incidents have moved to a decisive stage yesterday. Diplomatic circles here unanimously believe that Secretary of State Hull is deeply convinced that Japan is preparing to launch a blitzkrieg against the Dutch East Indies or Singapore, and that the United States is prepared to take counter measures. As for whether the first response to Japan's actions will occur in the economic or military spheres, officials refuse to predict. However, knowledgeable people expect that President Roosevelt will take joint action with the British, Australian, and Dutch East Indies governments. Regarding the whereabouts of the U.S. fleet, the Navy Department is maintaining strict secrecy. There are rumors that Japan is planning a sudden incident in the Far East to coincide with its advance in the Balkans. State Department personnel refuse to comment. Hull said that the warning to American citizens in the Far East is the United States' routine policy regarding areas with potential dangers. (International News Service, 14th)</p>
<p>Japan Eagerly Seeks Friendship with the Soviet Union to Facilitate its Southern Advance</p>
<p>Washington: With the increasing tension in the Pacific, people here are paying great attention to the Japanese statements regarding the Soviet Union, the Japanese actions in Moscow, and their relationship to the actions of Japanese imperialists. Just as Japan's new ambassador to the United States, Kichisaburo Nomura, has arrived in the United States, Japanese propaganda containing anti-Soviet sentiments has arrived one after another, the same situation as when his predecessor, Kensuke Horinouchi, first arrived in the United States, intending to create the impression that the deterioration of U.S.-Japan relations was instigated by the Soviet Union. At the same time, news from Moscow says that the Japanese are now doing their utmost to establish good relations with the Soviet Union, even at the cost of concessions they had never considered before. Observers here regard this as yet another effort by Japan to protect its rear through a friendship agreement, so that when the European situation favors the Axis powers, Japan can carry out its long-desired southern advance without any worries. However, there is indeed an atmosphere of anxiety, restlessness, and indecision in Tokyo. This can be seen in the Japanese's deliberate misinterpretation of President Roosevelt's remarks to reporters on Tuesday. The President stated that if the United States is forced to participate in the war in the Pacific, U.S. aid to Britain will not be affected. However, news from Tokyo said, "The President considers the war in the Pacific to be an unexpected event." People here are surprised by this misunderstanding, as no American reporter heard the President make this statement, and the President never mentioned the hypothetical question of aid to Britain in the event of war in the Pacific. When the President discussed this matter, he said that although the question was hypothetical, there was no reason not to answer it, so he firmly answered it in the negative. The President continued, "This is a legitimate question, and I have given it a legitimate answer." The general impression here is that the President indicated that the United States is now able to both take care of its important interests in the Pacific and continue to be a major arsenal supplying democratic countries resisting Axis aggression. As for the question of whether Japan is truly preparing to advance southward, although political circles here have differing opinions, many people are convinced that if Japan takes action against Singapore, it will inevitably conflict with the United States, as the United States' necessary rubber supply necessitates that the United States maintain the status quo of Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Japanese Spokesman Expresses Desire to Live Peacefully with Australia</p>
<p>Tokyo: During today's reception for foreign journalists, when the rumor that a war was about to break out in the Pacific was mentioned, a French reporter asked, "Is it true that the embassy circles in Tokyo are saying that a war in the Pacific is about to erupt?" The Acting Spokesman of the Information Bureau, Ishii, replied, "The atmosphere is indeed tense, and we must be prepared for any possible eventuality. There are still many rumors, but I don't think anything will happen." Regarding the statement that the Dutch government ordered Dutch ships in the Far East to sail to Manila or other neutral ports, Ishii said that he had not received official confirmation of this statement. When a reporter asked whether the Netherlands' answer at the Batavia conference was unreasonable or difficult to implement, Ishii declined to answer directly, but said that negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies had not stopped, and that the newspaper's evaluation of the lack of sincerity on the part of the Dutch East Indies was not based on fact. The reporter also asked Ishii for his opinion on the statement by the Australian Acting Prime Minister Fadden that although he had peaceful aspirations, the shadow of war in the Pacific was growing darker and darker. Ishii replied that Japan is extremely willing to maintain and promote good relations with Australia, as can be seen from the exchange of diplomatic representatives between the two countries. Japan's first ambassador to Australia is scheduled to depart on February 28. The reporter also asked about the situation of the Japan-Vietnam-Thailand conference in Tokyo. Ishii replied that the sooner the peaceful outcome of this conference, the better, but the issues currently being discussed are complex in nature, so this conference may take some time. Talks are currently ongoing every day. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Thailand Issues Important Statement: Still Maintains Friendship with Britain</p>
<p>Bangkok: The Thai government issued a communiqué stating that news from various sources is spreading that British military authorities have stationed land and air forces on the Thai border connecting Malaya and Burma, which may cause people to misunderstand that Britain is invading Thai territory. The Thai government hereby declares that the friendly relations between Britain and Thailand remain unimpaired. Both countries respect the treaties signed between them and the non-aggression pact, so mutual understanding and sympathy remain in perfect harmony.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japan Resolves to Exert Utmost Effort to Adjust Relations with the Soviet Union. Matsuoka Clarifies Policy in Parliament. <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo: Foreign Minister Matsuoka declared today in response to inquiries in the Budget Committee of the Lower House, "I have done my best to adjust Japanese-Soviet relations. The Soviet Union is inherently slow, so we must be patient and not be impetuous." The Foreign Minister added that the current environment is suitable for adjusting relations between the two countries, as the Soviet Union seems to have recognized Japan's sincerity in resolving various disputes. The Foreign Minister further stated that Japan has decided to restore free fishing, but the temporary fisheries agreement with the Soviet Union has finally been realized. The mixed committee proposed by the Soviet Union is now engaged in negotiations on a long-term fishing agreement. The Soviet Union has also taken a stance to promote the conclusion of a trade agreement. This matter was completely hopeless last year. The negotiations on this matter have made considerable progress. Regarding issues such as the border between "Manchukuo" and the Soviet Union and the oil industry in Northern Sakhalin, Japan is also willing to begin negotiations when the time is right. Matsuoka told a lawmaker that Japan and the Soviet Union did not conclude a non-aggression treaty because Japan could not obtain aid from Germany if war broke out between Japan and the Soviet Union, and did not want to comment. The lawmaker who raised the question stated that according to Article 5 of the Tripartite Pact, any signatory to the pact could independently engage in relations with the Soviet Union without being interfered with by the other two signatories. According to this provision, if a dispute arises between Japan and the Soviet Union, Germany and Italy do not necessarily have to assist Japan. The lawmaker emphasized that due to the tension in Japanese-American relations, the security of Japan's northern defenses is especially important. Matsuoka replied that he was very aware of the concerns regarding Article 5 of the Tripartite Pact, but that the purpose of drafting the article was to adjust Japanese-Soviet relations. Foreign policy should not be based solely on agreements, but should be based on changes and developments at any time. When the Foreign Minister was asked if Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov had hinted that Japan should abandon the anti-Comintern pact, the Foreign Minister replied, "From the perspective of adjusting Japanese-Soviet relations, the pact should of course be abandoned, but we cannot ignore the importance of the pact." A lawmaker said that the pact is an important factor related to domestic thought and Sino-Japanese relations in Japan, and it truly fits what Matsuoka said. (United Press, 14th)</p>

<p>New York: Prices on the trading market fell sharply today, to the second degree, the lowest level since June. This decline was caused by the public's great apprehension regarding the Balkans and the Far East. In addition, the labor and tax situation in the United States is not without its relationship. At the same time, the news that Dutch ships were taking refuge in neutral ports caused speculators to massively buy rubber, tin, pepper, and silk. (United Press, 13th)</p>

<h3 id="e5">Market Unrest <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Since the U.S. government has twice taken steps to evacuate overseas Chinese in Shanghai, coupled with the strong smell of war on the New York Stock Exchange market, Shanghai's market was plunged into unrest and panic in the past two days. In fact, the arrival of this situation was expected. Shanghai's mixed population and special environment mean that any disturbance can cause the people in Shanghai's market to feel like a lone ship sailing in the sea, subject to upheaval, or even like losing their compass, drifting aimlessly and uncertainly. Moreover, if the U.S. and Japan conflict, Shanghai's position is even more worrying for people. A nest under the eaves cannot withstand the destruction of a strong wind, and now the Pacific storm is about to arrive.</p>
<p>The most turbulent outflow in the market is also the most valuable U.S. exchange in the last three years; this is not because the U.S. dollar has any wavering, but rather a change in the Chinese people's hearts. People fear that the United States will freeze Japanese funds. If Shanghai's sluice is not blocked, the Japanese can use Chinese legal tender without limitation to convert into U.S. exchange. This beggar-thy-neighbor policy will make the effect of the U.S. freezing Japanese funds equal to zero. Therefore, the general public is apprehensive, believing that the United States will also take considerable preventive measures against China to strengthen the freezing of Japanese funds. In this unpredictable situation, especially private foreign exchange, it is not surprising that people are pouring out their possessions at this critical juncture. As a result, the U.S. exchange has a tendency to grow along with the Japanese. It goes without saying that U.S. dollar bills are even less valuable; a country's banknotes are originally inconvenient to use in another country, but the Chinese do not want anything but to consider the current situation of legal tender, regarding U.S. dollars as if they were real gold, collecting them in large numbers, and even using them for speculation. Now, they are selling them for fear of not being able to.</p>
<p>Of course, because American expatriates are preparing to evacuate, some of their investments in China, such as stocks, are being sold off to a considerable extent, and many are following suit. As a result, foreign stocks fell by an average of 20% the day before yesterday. However, this is a temporary phenomenon, and it will calm down in an instant after the hype passes. The most unnecessary thing is to sell public bonds in droves. Although it is said that the rise in public bonds has been too great, buying public bonds is still the most legitimate way to use funds; the reason for this need not be stated much. Think about it, speculation can indeed lead to windfall profits and instant wealth. But on the contrary, it can also lead to the loss of everything, becoming penniless. The advantages and disadvantages are half and half, so it can only be called speculation. The "investment" in speculation is originally the "investment" in gambling (commonly written as dice). Throwing dice is for gambling for winning or losing, and the profit or loss in speculation is no different from gambling with dice. If we can realize this, we can also know that the panic and failure of speculation are precisely the inevitable consequences. Public bonds are different. Although the Chinese war has lasted for more than 40 months, there has never been a delay in drawing lots for principal repayment and interest payment. Considering the amount of bonds issued by China, let alone far less than Japan, even in terms of China's economic foundation, no matter how Japan's coastal transportation is blockaded, or how strict the bamboo-joint-style control in the occupied areas is, how strictly the flow of goods between various places is cut off, or even confiscation and humiliation, it still cannot erase the latent resilience of the Chinese people. That is to say, China issues new public bonds due to the war, but in the end, the value of the various bonds themselves can still determine their resilience. This is truly because the Chinese government does not make those who support public bonds feel discouraged, and instead allows the speculators' arrogance to grow. Therefore, buying public bonds is still not a bad way to turn righteousness into profit.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, there will be more times of panic: but remember that the higher the degree of panic in Shanghai, the faster the light ahead will be, which is precisely the opposite and complementary. The most undesirable thing is to add fuel to the fire during this period of public panic, such as rice merchants happily taking advantage of the disaster and manipulating rice prices. Since the war, the prices of rice, coal, and flour have risen the most, nearly tenfold. Of course, it cannot be entirely blamed on each industry itself. The excessively high transportation costs and the blockade of raw materials are also factors, but rice, coal, and flour are brought in regardless, and stockpiled regardless. But the market price is still not loose, and it rises sharply even with slight rumors, which means that it is the merchants who are taking advantage of the situation for profit. Know that in a turbulent world, the best way to protect one's interests is to know when to stop. The ancients said, "The mantis only knows to catch the cicada, but does not know that the oriole is behind it." This shows that those who are greedy already have strong enemies watching behind them. Moreover, behind the oriole, there are still children with bows waiting to fire. Therefore, under the same environment and the same life, mutual benefit is the only true benefit. Although people think that troubled times are an opportunity to get rich, wealth needs to have legal protection, otherwise, the road is also dangerous, and the mantis and the oriole can be examples. A wise Chinese businessman should think more from the big picture and not make excessive demands, enriching his own private pockets. He should know that "the more he does for others, the more he has; the more he gives to others, the more he has." This is a good way to preserve wealth in a troubled world!</p>
<h3 id="e6">Fierce Fighting Near Mianyang; Guangdong Army Captures Lubao Datang; Henan People's Militia Organization is Perfect, Assisting in Combat and Inflicting Heavy Damage on the Japanese <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: Near Lubao in Guangdong and near Mianyang in Hubei, fighting is still ongoing. According to a war report from the Guangdong front, Japanese troops from Sanshui and Foshan once advanced northward along the west side of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway in northwestern Guangdong. They arrived at Lubao on February 11 and, after fierce fighting, the Eastern New Guards advanced. According to news from western Hubei, fierce fighting is currently underway in the east and northwest of Mianyang. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: A military spokesman reported this afternoon on the battle in southern Henan, saying that the Japanese troops participating in this battle were the 40th, 3rd, 15th, and 17th Divisions, numbering 100,000, and were highly mechanized. The Chinese forces opposing them were three army corps of Tang Enbo's command and He Zhuguo's command in eastern Henan. The Japanese, with their superior strength and equipment, attempted to achieve their goal of opening up the Ping-Han Railway on the plains of Henan Province, but they collapsed and returned to their original positions in less than two weeks. The reasons for this were fourfold: (1) The Chinese army avoided head-on main force clashes and adopted a strategy of encirclement or rear raids, leaving the Japanese troops no moment of rest. (2) The people of southern Henan are tough and the people's militia organization is complete and meticulous, able to thoroughly implement the policy of clearing the countryside and assist the regular army in attacking at any time. (3) The Japanese army could not maintain rear transportation and replenishment supplies, all of which were difficult. (4) The Japanese army left garrison troops at important strongholds along the way, weakening their strength even further. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Military news, on the 12th at noon, the Chinese army recaptured Datang in Lubao and continued to pursue the defeated Japanese, recapturing Niaoshigang and Jiushijiu Gang. (14th dispatch)</p>
<p>Xingji: On the 7th, after the Chinese army recaptured Liuping, southwest of Jincheng, they took advantage of the victory to pursue northward, capturing many along the way. When the Japanese fled to Xuliangzhang (northwest of Jincheng), they were attacked by the Chinese army, and Xuliangzhang was also recovered. The remnants fled in disarray to Donglingkou. In addition to sending troops to track and pursue, the Chinese army also actively attacked Tianshiling. (13th dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng: At Linghekou on the Hanyi Road, the Japanese attached several cannons. On the 10th, the Chinese attacked them with a part of their forces and ambushed at Zhuanqiao, killing more than 100 Japanese. At the same time, the Chinese cut off the Shaling Highway. They encountered reinforcements from Shashi at Yaowan. After two hours of fighting, the Japanese were defeated and retreated. (13th dispatch)</p>
<p>Luoyang: During the Japanese army's invasion of Wuyang in southern Henan, Mr. Wang Mutang, a member of the gentry, first moved the elderly, young, women, and children to safety, leaving only the able-bodied men. He opened the village gates wide. When 200 Japanese cavalrymen charged in, seeing the streets full of tables and chairs, they thought the people were welcoming them and all entered. The Chinese, who had ambushed able-bodied men in advance, immediately opened fire. Some threw stones in a flurry. The Japanese troops were in disarray for a time, with corpses piled up. The tables and chairs were transformed into obstacles, and the Japanese army could not escape, so they were all annihilated. (13th dispatch)</p>
<p>Luoyang: A certain Chinese unit ambushed near Yimenji Dongjinzhuang in the northwest of Guoyang in northern Anhui. On the 11th, more than a dozen Japanese cars, full of Japanese soldiers, passed through the area and were intercepted by the Chinese ambushers. Many Japanese were killed, and the remnants fled to the southwest. (13th dispatch)</p>
<p>Huizhou and Danshui Repeatedly Suffered Fierce Bombing</p>
<p>According to news from Hong Kong, gasoline drums, motor parts, and tung oil on the Hong Kong-Shaoguan Highway were all destroyed by Japanese bombing, causing losses of millions of dollars. The area between Huizhou and Danshui suffered the heaviest bombing. American gasoline and motor parts were not allowed to be transported to the interior in Hong Kong, so they were all transported by sandboats to Dapeng Bay for landing. In the middle of the previous week, Japanese planes bombed 50 sandboats in Dapeng Bay, and more than 30 sandboats transporting these goods in the Dongjiang River were also attacked. Huizhou and Danshui have been fiercely bombed by Japanese planes for several weeks, and have almost become ruins. The reason why Japanese planes bombed these two cities is because they suspected that a large amount of gasoline and other military supplies were stored in the cities. The export of tung oil from the interior has been prevented due to repeated bombings. The tung oil shipped to the United States is used to exchange for American goods. In the past, 5,000 tons were transported through the Hong Kong-Shaoguan Highway every month, but now it is only 2,000 tons. Recently, about 1,000 tons of tung oil have been shipped to the Soviet Union every month. There is currently a Japanese aircraft carrier in Dapeng Bay. It is feared that Japanese air raids on the Hong Kong-Shaoguan Highway will continue. Although the Japanese army has mobilized in the semicircular basin of the East River and North River area northeast of Guangzhou, it is said that the Japanese army currently only wants to prevent the import of gasoline and automobiles into Free Guangdong. It is rumored that the Japanese troops gathered north of Guangzhou do not want to advance towards Shaoguan, but are preparing to use them for the southward advance when Germany launches a blitzkrieg in Europe.

<p>Japanese General Yokoyama Killed in Action in Dangyang</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to a Chinese war report the other day, Japanese Major General Yokoyama was killed in action in Dangyang. A certain military agency has obtained a further report from the front, stating that Yokoyama was the commander of the 18th Brigade and participated in the battle in central Hubei last year. General Zhang Zizhong, commander of the Chinese group army, was killed in that battle. It is a coincidence that Zhang's old troops responded in the Dangyang battle this time. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e7">After the Calamity: A True Account of Nanyang <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Nanyang: Your correspondent, having arrived from the south of Henan amidst the resounding victory reports, inspected Nanyang. On the 10th, I met with various ranks of officers and soldiers who had fought fiercely on the city's outskirts. I also interviewed captured engineers at a certain location and witnessed the actual battlefield conditions, as well as the state of Nanyang after the calamity. According to reports, this battle holds great significance, not only safeguarding Xiangfan and Luoyang, consolidating the southeastern flank of the Great Northwest, but also heralding the prelude to victories following setbacks. It is understood that the enemy, with the main force of the 3rd Division, along with other units totaling over ten thousand, used a large number of aircraft for cover, circumventing the Tongbai Mountains and outflanking our front lines. They originally planned to swiftly seize Nanyang, which had limited forces. Unexpectedly, from dawn on the 3rd, they were met with attacks from our troops everywhere. The enemy aircraft then resorted to low-altitude bombing, making it impossible for our troops to maneuver on the open plains. They rerouted their main force westward and encircled the south of the city, attempting to annihilate our field army in the northern suburbs. However, our officers and soldiers fought bravely, engaging the enemy in mixed combat with bayonets in the northwest of the city for two days and nights. Finally, on the night of the 4th, according to the original plan, they moved towards the outer lines, encircling the Japanese forces who had fallen into the vicinity of Nanyang. Under the cover of a strong wind, they suddenly moved from fifty miles west of the city at midnight, sweeping and thrusting for three hours. The enemy, in a state of panic, collapsed and retreated southeast. Those Japanese soldiers who could not retreat were captured alive by our forces. A Japanese superior combat soldier named Aida Daisaburo, upon being captured, shouted "Treat prisoners well!" in Chinese. The prisoners confessed that they had not eaten for three days and had not slept for half a month, and were extremely exhausted. Observing the situation, the enemy's defeat was indeed due to their becoming weaker with each battle and the demoralization of their troops. In reality, it demonstrated the superb strategic and tactical skills of our senior commanders in luring the enemy into exhaustion. It also proved that we become stronger with each battle, and that officers and soldiers are willing to give their lives. During the heat of the battle, a certain division commander personally inspected the regiment, supervising the attacks. Every village became a battleground where our forces and the enemy fought back and forth. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented in recent warfare, according to a certain general. To this day, at the foot of Purple Mountain and along the White River, hundreds of enemy corpses lie abandoned, being buried by our forces. The ruins of various battlefields present a desolate sight. Fortunately, the area is still small, and many people have returned. On the roads to the south, people of all ages are seen supporting each other, an endless stream. When they see our troops of a certain regiment who have recovered the county seat, they respectfully offer their greetings. Local administrative authorities are working to appease the displaced and restore order, while investigating spies. (13th dispatch)</p>

<p>Tokyo: Many American residents who had remained in Japan have begun to evacuate. Following yesterday's announcement by the American consulate urging non-essential personnel to leave Japan as soon as possible, today, they are rushing to purchase ship tickets and reserve cabin space, causing extreme busyness for shipping companies, who are overwhelmed. Among the Americans evacuating this time are missionaries and others who have hesitated to leave Japan for a long time. After investigation, this agency has learned that half of the American residents have already left Japan. The British authorities have also continued to urge British residents to evacuate. However, the number of British residents evacuating is smaller than that of American residents. Nearly seven hundred British residents have left Japan so far, with approximately nineteen hundred still remaining in Japan and Manchuria. As for American residents, there were two thousand three hundred and twenty-three residing in Japan a year ago. Only one thousand and fifty remain who have not left, including five hundred and fifty men, three hundred and eighty women, and one hundred and twenty children. (14th United Press dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e11">Results of Italian-Spanish Talks: Franco Returns to Madrid, Rumor That Italian Premier's Requests Rejected, Spain Lacks Food and Cannot Wage War <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Montpellier: Spanish Head of State General Franco, having met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Italy, arrived here at 1:55 PM today. He was immediately hosted at a banquet by French Head of State Marshal Pétain at the residence of the Prefect of Aveyron province. Those invited from the Spanish side, in addition to General Franco, included the Foreign Minister, Army Chief of Staff General Súñer, and from the French side, in addition to Marshal Pétain, included Cabinet Secretary and Foreign Minister Darlan, Minister of the Interior Peyrouton, Ambassador to Spain Piétri. In addition, Italian Ambassador to France Guariglia, Italian representatives to the Franco-Italian Armistice Commission, Rear Admiral De Courten and General Lebbraetti were also invited to attend. In order to comply with food consumption restriction regulations, the dishes prepared by the French side were quite simple. After the banquet, Franco and Pétain walked to the balcony to acknowledge the crowd. General Franco was very pleased to see the enthusiastic cheers of the crowd and immediately raised his right hand, giving a Roman salute in response. Marshal Pétain initially saluted, then removed his hat and waved it, looking very joyful. The two heads of state then retired to another room for talks, which lasted until 4:45 PM. Marshal Pétain escorted his guests to the door of the "Pétain Square," shaking hands in farewell. General Franco's party then departed in twenty-five high-speed automobiles, speeding away to the sound of the French and Spanish national anthems played by a military band. Marshal Pétain's party then proceeded to pay their respects at the war memorial, before returning to Vichy by special train at 10:00 PM that evening. (13th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Montpellier: According to a Vichy dispatch from the Lausanne Daily, it is believed that the discussions between Mussolini and Franco concerned the evacuation of Italian residents from Abyssinia. The evacuation of civilians requires the use of the Addis Ababa to Djibouti railway, and this terminus is in French Somaliland. Therefore, the evacuation issue is also related to France. The reason for Pétain's meeting with Franco is likely due to this. Political observers in Zurich believe that Mussolini may have inquired of Franco what kind of assistance Spain could provide to Italy. (14th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome: Regarding the talks between Mussolini and Franco, the responsible authorities here emphasized three points in particular: the current stage of political and military affairs, and Franco's personal involvement, which shows the importance of these talks. The entire country of Italy has warmly welcomed the solidarity between the two countries. Two issues are particularly important in the announcement: one concerns European issues in the current war, and the other concerns the reorganization of Europe, which is of concern to both countries in this historic era. The consensus between the two leaders on these issues shows that Spain and the Axis powers remain united. (14th Shuntoku News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Vichy: Today's news from here regarding the Franco-Spanish-Italian talks states that Hitler asked Mussolini to request Spain to assist in the attack on Gibraltar with the Axis powers' naval and air forces, or to allow German troops to pass through Spain to attack Gibraltar, while at the same time granting Italy many necessary naval and air bases. It is rumored that Franco refused this request during his meeting with Mussolini in Riviera, Italy, on Wednesday. At the same time, a message was released here stating that Marshal Pétain and Franco met in Montpellier, France, yesterday, but there is no official news today regarding the content of the talks. However, reliable sources say that Franco's talks with Pétain, and the Spanish Foreign Minister Súñer's talks with the French Secretary of State and Foreign Minister Darlan, all stated that Spain wishes to continue its policy of neutrality. News from here states that Hitler considered that if his wishes were rejected, it would greatly affect Germany's reputation, so he did not directly ask Franco, but asked the Italian Prime Minister to convey them. It is said that Mussolini originally wanted to invite Franco and Súñer to Genoa, but the British warships bombed Genoa heavily during their recent attack, so the original plan was changed. The official message issued by Rome only stated that Franco and Mussolini had reached a consensus on European issues related to both countries, but observers believe that it is doubtful that Franco would have gone to such lengths to discuss only opinions. Initial news stated that Franco did not carry a peace mission, and the purpose of the talks did not seem to be to change Spain's consistent policy in the near future. Franco seems willing to strengthen the Latin bloc of Mediterranean countries only when Britain's actions in the Mediterranean affect maritime traffic between Spain and Italy, France, French North Africa, and Spanish Morocco. Observers here do not yet know the results of the Spanish-Italian and Franco-Spanish talks. (14th International News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>New York: A dispatch from Vichy states that although the Spanish Head of State was under great pressure from Mussolini, he has refused to assist Italy in attacking Gibraltar. Mussolini cited the various aids Italy had given to Spain in the past and asked Franco to provide bases to attack Gibraltar to repay Italy, but this was rejected. According to Franco's explanation, Spain is suffering from a severe food shortage and cannot risk war against Britain, and Britain is helping Spain with food. Mussolini promised to supply Spain with food from Europe, but Franco still firmly refused. Mussolini explicitly stated that the bases he needed were the Spanish ports of Cartagena and Minorca, and the Canary Islands. (14th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Sofia: According to well-informed diplomatic circles here today, German leader Hitler may demand that the Yugoslav government allow troops to pass through Yugoslavia's Vardar Valley to Thessaloniki. This news coincides with the sudden flight of Yugoslav Prime Minister Cvetković and Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković to Germany. There is much speculation here today as to whether Hitler intends to move his troops only through Yugoslavia, or through Bulgaria as well. It is widely believed that Germany's intention to move troops through Bulgaria is to encircle Turkey or reach the Dardanelles. Because the mountains across Bulgaria to Greece are overlapping, it is difficult to march. It is said that the Vardar Valley is the easiest route to Thessaloniki. Today, the Sofia Radio Station is trying to portray Bulgaria's outlet to the Aegean Sea, claiming, "The solution to this problem is now imminent." At the same time, foreign news reports that German aircraft are currently concentrated in Bulgaria, but this has been denied by officials here. However, officials acknowledged that Bulgarian military actions are currently being accelerated. It is rumored that Bulgarian King Boris may travel to Germany to meet with Hitler, but this news has not yet been confirmed today. (14th International News Agency dispatch)</p>

The delegation will also visit German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at his castle near Salzburg, staying in Germany for about two days. (14th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia: Well-informed diplomatic circles here said today that German leader Hitler, Yugoslav Prime Minister Cvetković, and Bulgarian King Boris may hold a triangular meeting.

When capturing the paratroopers, the two sides exchanged fire, but they had not yet completed their sabotage work when they were captured. (14th United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e16">Hitler in Dilemma, Currently Considering Four Actions, Many Concerns Regarding Invading Bulgaria and Pressuring France, Time for Attacking Britain and Launching Major War Still Pending <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>London: Well-informed sources here say that German leader Hitler is currently considering four actions, all of which should be launched immediately. The first action is to invade Bulgaria, but the obstacle is the Soviet Union. The semi-official statements and official declarations issued by Soviet government officials all indicate that the Soviet government clearly opposes Germany's invasion of Bulgaria and gaining influence in its sphere of influence in the Dardanelles Strait. The second action is to invade the unoccupied zone of France, but this step may result in officials of the Vichy government joining General de Gaulle's Free French movement. The difficult position of General Weygand, Commander-in-Chief of French Forces in Africa, is also preventing Hitler from taking free action in that area. This hero of the World War still retains considerable influence in the Pétain government and maintains cooperation with Germany, but if the German side violates the armistice agreement and occupies the unoccupied zone of France, Weygand's attitude may suddenly change. The third action is to invade Britain, but the difficulties or even "impossibilities" of invading Britain have been repeatedly reported. However, military experts agree that invading Britain is a determined plan and a necessary step for Germany to win. Therefore, the invasion of Britain will definitely happen. The only secret is the timing. The fourth action is to launch the above three actions simultaneously, while Japan launches a containment war in the Far East. (14th International News dispatch)</p>

<p>Washington: After the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed the important Lend-Lease Bill by a vote of 15 to 8 yesterday, the Senate will debate the bill starting next week. The Foreign Relations Committee has rejected proposals to restrict the President's power to send armed forces out of the Western Hemisphere. Senate Democratic Majority Leader Barkley of Kentucky said that the Lend-Lease Bill is likely to pass the Senate by a 2 to 1 margin within about ten days. The number of opposing votes in the Senate will likely be no more than 20 to 25. The Foreign Relations Committee's report on the bill stated, "This bill is not a war bill, nor does it authorize the President to send troops to fight in foreign countries. It is a practical way to ensure that the United States does not get involved in war and is the result of two basic principles of American foreign policy: (1) The United States must use all means to strive to maintain peace with other countries; (2) For the sake of America's own interests, the United States should supply useful materials to any country whose defense is inextricably linked to the defense of the United States." "In order to achieve the goal of fighting for freedom, this bill is to add America's industrial manufacturing power to the resistance against armed aggression, because this kind of armed aggression may one day turn its spearhead towards our country." The signatories of this report were fourteen Democratic senators and one Republican senator. (14th United Press dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e42">Japanese Influence Extends to Thailand <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>This is a wireless telegram from the New York Times correspondent in Manila, Mr. Aponto. The translation is as follows:</p>
<p>Singapore officials believe that the conflict between Thailand and Vietnam was largely instigated to achieve the purpose of "when the snipe and clam fight, the fisherman benefits." If Thailand allows Japan to use its air force bases as a result, it will be of great strategic importance to Japan's southward policy, because Japan's air force bases in northern Vietnam are 1,000 miles away from Singapore, while Thailand's airfields are only 400 miles away. With this development, Japan's threat to Singapore and British East India will be shortened by 600 miles.</p>
<p>This threatening plan has been gradually confirmed by official actions and statements. For example, on December 6 last year, Japan concluded a nine-year treaty with the Thai government, stipulating mutual respect for territorial integrity and promising to consult each other on all relevant issues. Later, Thai Prime Minister and Minister of Defense and Foreign Affairs, as well as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy and Air Force, Sanggram, also stated that even if the conflict between Thailand and Vietnam in the Mekong River area is satisfactorily resolved, Thailand's resentment towards Vietnam will not end.</p>
<p>For several years, Japan and Thailand have exchanged commercial, naval, and goodwill envoys, and Japan has also helped Thailand develop its navy and air force. Last autumn, Thailand purchased ten bombers from the United States. When they were transported through the Philippines, the US government suddenly ordered them to be detained. Japan immediately gave Thailand ten of the same aircraft. A Thai goodwill envoy also secretly concluded a deal with Japan, in which Japan agreed to give Thailand forty long-range bombers and part of the military supplies withdrawn from Nanjing this spring.</p>
<p>In early December last year, when Thailand held its National Day celebration, important Japanese government officials made special broadcasts in Tokyo to express their congratulations. Japanese newspapers have always supported Thailand's territorial demands on Vietnam and have repeatedly stated that Japan will never allow European and American countries to exert pressure on Thailand.</p>
<p>Thailand's anti-foreign movement is also largely instigated. There are about 4 million overseas Chinese in Thailand, and they occupy a large share of the business and financial circles. The Thai government is using the state-owned system to deprive them of their economic power and confiscate their property. A certain Thai government official recently announced in public that "Thailand should treat overseas Chinese in the same way that Germany treats Jews." However, the potential power of overseas Chinese is still great, which can cause setbacks to Japan's trade development plans.</p>
<p>Several years ago, Thailand forced British and American oil plants, but the supply was intermittent and could not refine special aircraft oil. By the time the European war broke out, the country had purchased a large amount of aviation fuel and stored it for use.</p>
<p>Thailand's military strength is strongest in its air force, while its navy is vulnerable. The army has a larger number of troops and is better equipped, and can be called a second-rate army by Eastern standards. There are particularly many naval and military attachés in the Japanese embassy, and it is generally believed that they are Thai naval and military advisors.</p>

The transaction price of the current month's US exchange rate in the morning actually reached 5.5625 yuan, and the March exchange rate also did this price, so 5.59375 yuan had been quoted at that time. At noon, with HSBC coming in, it became slightly stable. Although speculators sold in the afternoon, HSBC continued to purchase, and the market rebounded. As for the Japanese banks and Chinese banks that came to hedge US and British exchange rates, it was about 3.8875 yuan. Before the evening close, there were more reports of British expatriate evacuations and the dispatch of Far East postal ships and other Pacific tensions, so the trend was still loose. As a result, the spot British exchange rate was reported at 2 shillings and 4.0625 pence, and the US exchange rate was 5.53125 yuan, which was higher than the previous day's British and US exchange rates by 0.015625 and 0.02125 respectively.</p>

It is estimated that the February US exchange rate of 5.5625 yuan was favorable to foreign firms, and at the same time, Hong Kong Electric absorbed the speculator's next month's US exchange rate of 5.5615 yuan. A little later, speculators re-entered the Chinese bank, and the same month's US exchange rate was also 5.5625 yuan, so it was extremely chaotic at this time. The current month's US exchange rate had been quoted as high as 5.59375 yuan. HSBC's listing announcement, the British exchange rate did not move, the US exchange rate increased by 125, reaching 5.375 yuan, and other exchanges such as Dutch, Luxembourg, and Japanese exchanges also loosened. This US bank and its benefits sold the spot to Japanese banks first, making it as low as 3 shillings and 4.3875 pence.

<h3 id="e44">Rumors Abound, the Gold Market is Chaotic, the Lowest Price is 6,200 Yuan <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold black market, rose and fell with its own vigor, from the morning opening of 6,200 yuan, it could actually rebound to 6,375 yuan, the difference between high and low was a huge 175 yuan. The order of honor and disgrace was entirely controlled by the people. Although there were many bearish rumors, there was no shortage of people temporarily buying in, and those who were nervous about short positions were also hedging a lot, so it was easier to rise suddenly in the midst of fatigue. The morning opening was because it was heard outside the market last night that a certain bank had already sold at 6,280 yuan, which caused a general wave of speculators to aggressively suppress the price. The opening was only 6,220 yuan, and it once fell to 6,200 yuan. Later, it was snatched up by Chenji, Yiyuan, Yifeng, Yong and others, and rebounded to 6,300 yuan, but the foreign exchange rate increased, and the bank gangs and Tongkang Yong re-plugged in, falling back to 6,235 yuan. After that, thanks to the stabilization of the exchange market, the draft dealers Dafeng, Yongcheng, and Defu all purchased, reaching 6,340 yuan, and the noon close was still outside the 300 yuan mark. The market did not perform well at the beginning of the afternoon, at 6,290 yuan. After opening, it was heard that the exchange market was slightly soft, and the buying momentum rose to 6,375 yuan. Once again, it was stimulated by short-selling rumors, and the draft dealers and banks sold, retreating to the 300 yuan mark. The closing was 6,320 yuan, which was smaller than the previous day's 18 yuan. After closing, it was reported at 6,300 yuan. Also, today's swap price, the morning opening had a premium for long positions, about 15 yuan. Before the afternoon opening, the listing was 17 yuan, and the shorts such as Gonghe, Lianxing, and Mingfeng were offering 10 yuan. After Dafeng and Xinyuan were willing to offer premiums, it gradually became even. The total daily turnover was about 12,000 taels. The silver building jewelry eventually stabilized, and the tariff and so on were flat.</p>
<p>Cash Gold's Fluctuations Were Huge</p>
<p>In the early morning, the market was sold by a certain bank outside the market last night, and it had been pressed to 6,280 yuan, so people's minds were affected by it, and the selling momentum suddenly rose at the opening. It was also rumored that the United States wanted to freeze the funds of all countries in the world, which was like adding fuel to the fire, and the selling voice became more noisy, eventually announcing a press down to 6,220 yuan at the opening, which was more than 110 yuan lower than the previous day's evening market. It once dropped to 6,200 yuan in an instant. At this time, the table was chaotic, and the buying and selling accounts were unclear, but the return momentum started at the same time, because the general mind was empty and floating, and the profit was concluded. Moreover, many thought that the price had fallen too much, so it was temporarily beneficial to buy in. Accounts such as Chenji, Yiyuan, Yifeng, Yong and others kept absorbing, and the price gradually rose. It hovered the longest on the 6,250 yuan line, and there were many transactions. Eventually, it was lifted to 6,300 yuan. Later, due to the sharp increase in foreign exchange, HSBC's listing also loosened, and the selling momentum came again. The bank gangs and Tongkang Yong each sold huge amounts, and were unable to support the decline, reaching 6,235 yuan. However, after that, the foreign exchange stabilized, and HSBC maintained it. Buyers reunited, and Dafeng, Defu, Yongcheng, and Lianxing were the main ones, and they were able to raise the price to outside the 6,300 yuan mark, reaching 6,340 yuan. At noon, due to a slight rebound in foreign exchange, the closing price was stable at 6,322 yuan. The afternoon opening was weak, only 6,290 yuan. Later, thanks to the search by Dacheng, Lida, Shihe and others, the trend rose, and the foreign exchange also tightened. The best reached 6,375 yuan, but soon there was a rumor of a certain bearish rumor, and people's minds fell, and the price immediately fell. It is estimated that Tianbao, Hengji, Chenji, and Xinfeng Yong and others plugged in to 6,310 yuan. After that, there were few ups and downs, and the evening close was set at 6,320 yuan, which was 18 yuan smaller than the previous day. After the close, the market was only 6,300 yuan. The cash was first sold by Hesheng to Xianghe for 50 taels, with a term transaction 110 yuan higher. Later, Shunyuan sold 40 taels to Tongkang Yong, and then sold 100 taels, and Yongfengyu sold 200 taels. Hengji sold 10 taels, all of which were bought by Defu, which was 120 yuan higher. In the afternoon, Juxing Yong sold Zhida for 30 taels for 140 yuan. Therefore, the selling price of the cash number's own brand gold was 150 yuan higher than the cash gold term transaction, and the purchase was 50 yuan lower. There was no market for the current standard gold.</p>
<p>The Price of Jewelry Fell and Rose Again</p>

It is estimated that Datonghang listed 660 yuan, and Xintonghang was similar to the previous price. The purchase was 30 yuan lower.</p>
<h3 id="e45">The Hong Kong Dollar Suddenly Trended Lower <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>

<h3 id="e46">Grain Prices Skyrocket in Rice Market; New Orders Still Being Transacted; Over 30,000 Bags of Saigon Rice Arrive <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Today, a large quantity of foreign rice arrived at the port. The French ship (A1bert Sarraut), managed by the Wah Lun Foreign Firm, carried over 24,000 bags directly from Saigon, expected to arrive tonight. Additionally, the French company's ship, Ross, carrying over 13,000 bags from Saigon, is expected to arrive around the 18th. As for the Dutch ship, "Zhi Ba De," carrying over 30,000 bags from Hong Kong, it was ordered to sail to the Philippines. After arriving in Shanghai last night, it didn't unload and continued to Hong Kong. Although 30,000 bags of foreign rice were shipped away, the supply source will not be affected. (Zu)</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market was even more robust. Customers, stimulated by the tense situation between Japan and the United States, rushed to purchase. Holders seized the opportunity to raise prices. Both spot and futures prices opened higher. However, the consecutive days of price increases were driven by rumors. In reality, Shanghai's warehouse reserves of foreign rice already exceeded one million bags. With ample goods on the way and new orders placed, Shen Kee Foreign Firm sold 2,000 tons of Saigon mixed broken rice for March delivery at a fixed price of 73 yuan. Therefore, all rumors should be viewed with skepticism. Any price increase was suppressed by profit-taking sales, while actual sales were hampered by high prices, leading to a wait-and-see attitude. Consequently, prices fell slightly by three to five jiao in the later market. Futures were particularly welcomed by speculators. Number One Saigon road opened at 97 yuan, February at 94 yuan and 4 jiao, small grain spot at 88 yuan, January at 88 yuan and 3 (jiao), February at 88 yuan and a half. The early market still attempted to call prices higher, but due to speculative selling, the market returned to level. As a result, prices only increased by half a yuan to nearly one yuan compared to the previous day. However, the volume of transactions did increase significantly, with 11,300 bags of spot rice and around 1,000 tons of futures changing hands. Yesterday's trading opened with Number One new Saigon at 82 yuan and 5 jiao, down to 82 yuan, old at 84 yuan and a half, down to 84 yuan, Number Two at 79 yuan, then to 77 yuan, Number One Siam at 81 yuan, down to 80 yuan, special at 82 yuan and a half, fired grain at 81 yuan and 5 jiao, then to 80 yuan, high at 82 yuan, small grain at 75 yuan and 3 jiao, down to 75 yuan, East warehouse at 74 yuan, down to 73 yuan and 8 jiao, rice tea at 71 yuan and 2 (jiao), broken tips high from 67 yuan, then to 62 yuan.</p>
<p>Thick and thin粳and other domestic rice varieties initially tightened due to foreign rice, but now arrivals are scarce. Not only are sellers firm in their intention to sell, but the sales market is also continuing to be active. Therefore, the market situation is promising. As a result, thick 粳rose again by one yuan, while thin稻increased by half a yuan. Regular original white粳opened at 107 yuan, special at 108 yuan, (斛) special saw 103 yuan and a half, Kunshan original white粳at 105 or 6 yuan, (斛) saw 102 yuan, down to 99 yuan, Qingjiao (斛) saw thin稻at 95 yuan, 94 yuan and a half.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice still had scattered sales channels, so although other goods were promising, it remained just average. Hong Kong special white still sold for 81 yuan, ordinary at 80 yuan, 78 yuan and 5 jiao, glutinous tea at 72 or 3 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Flour Market Quietens Down <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The current flour market is gradually stabilizing. In terms of supply, apart from some transshipped goods from Hong Kong, large quantities of Canadian and Australian flour are still en route, expected to arrive in about ten days. However, with various commodity prices falling in recent days, only rice prices remain high, driven by international rumors. Since flour and rice are related, public sentiment has slightly stabilized. The market has seen fewer transactions. Only five or six hundred bags of Open Flower Clock Tower brand Australian flour were traded at 23 yuan and 8 jiao, slightly tighter by 5 fen compared to the previous day. Futures were at 23 yuan and a half to 23 yuan, also without significant transactions. Chinese mill flour remained at 113 yuan, with about 6,000 bags sold by the two mills, mostly for small-scale retail.</p>
<p>The wheat market remained as quiet as ever. Arrivals and inventories are both depleted. Chinese and Japanese mills have no goods to acquire. The market only has asking prices without actual transactions. Concession goods still require around 38 yuan. Japanese mills limit prices to 32 yuan to 32 yuan and a half, with no formal transactions. On the 15th, 1,500 bags of corn were shipped to Yantai.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Securities: Public Bonds Fluctuate Wildly, Plunging and Surging; Foreign Stocks Remain Flat <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The speed and magnitude of the fluctuations in the public bond gray market yesterday were unprecedented, with a difference of 3 yuan between the high and low prices in a single day. Prices plunged by more than 1 yuan in the morning, then surged by 2 yuan in the afternoon. There were no significant changes or rumors in the situation. The old news of American residents evacuating was reiterated, but it was only advisory in nature and not cause for panic. The morning's drop could be considered unnecessary worry. The rapid decline led to the afternoon's rebound. Speculators had been heavily shorting for many days, so a reversal was inevitable. Due to differing opinions, the competition between bulls and bears was exceptionally fierce. Yesterday's trading saw Xin Fu, Xin Hua, and Zhong Fu consistently buying throughout the morning and afternoon. In the afternoon, Xie Xing Yuan, Lian Yi, Yi Zhong, Lian He, and Kuang Tai also made significant purchases. Sellers were scattered and widespread, including Hong Da, Heng Fu, Tong Yu, and Tian Qing in the morning, and Hong Da, Tong Kang, Le Mao, and Tong Xing in the afternoon. Retail investors fluctuated between long and short positions, struggling to keep up. In this period of extreme volatility, such high and low phenomena are common. After the sharp drop and surge, prices rebounded by 3 jiao and a half to 1 yuan and 2 jiao. E-bonds were slightly lower by 4 jiao. The trading volume was approximately 3.8 million yuan. A concise summary is provided below:</p>
<p>The stock market opened at a low price, then slightly increased. The final result was almost unchanged from the opening price. Leading stocks such as English Union and Jardine Matheson remained stable. However, Wheelock &amp; Co. had too many overbought chips and was sold down to a low price of 81 yuan, closing at 82 yuan with buyers. Trust company stocks were actively sought after. New companies such as Xin He, Jardine Brewery, and Shanghai Velvet also maintained support. There were many transactions of Real Estate and Cheong Tai, and the price was stable. Rubber stocks were still slightly under pressure from sellers.</p>
<p>London, 13th (Thursday) - Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds and Far East British company stocks remained flat. Bank stocks continued to fall. Mercantile Bank shares continued to fall by 3 shillings and 9 pence to 8 pounds and 10 shillings. HSBC English-registered shares fell by 2 pounds to 7-5 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Tong Yi Textile Mill Issues Dividends Again</p>
<p>The British-owned Tong Yi Textile Co., Ltd. had a net profit of over 7,268,000 national currency yuan in 1940. Together with the retained earnings from the previous year, the total was over 8,985,000 yuan.

<h3 id="e49">Yarn and Cotton: Speculation Takes Advantage to Suppress Prices; Yarn Market Collapses; Double Horse Brand Lowest at 1312 Yuan <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to decline, and the downward trend was particularly strong. This was due to conflicting rumors that caused confusion. Speculators took advantage of the situation to suppress prices. Long positions became weak in this environment and were forced to close out large positions. As a result, the market gradually declined, reaching new lows. However, some, having already fallen by 200 yuan in the past five days, dared not attempt to short sell. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,342 yuan, and the low price was 1,312 yuan. In the afternoon, it initially traded at 1,345 yuan, then at 1,328 yuan, and finally at 1,335 yuan.</p>
<p>The Double Horse opening was due to rumors that plagued the afternoon, and public sentiment was already weak. The opening price was 1,338 yuan. As soon as this price was reached, sellers flooded the market, driving the price down to 1,312 yuan. Then, due to profit-taking and the rise in gold prices, the price gradually rose to 1,336 yuan. However, demand was still weak, and the price weakened again, falling to 1,324 yuan. This back-and-forth occurred several times. The closing price was 1,332 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 8,003 bales. The amounts purchased by each sector are listed below:</p>
<p>No One Cares About Cotton</p>
<p>The spot cotton situation remains bleak. This is because the yarn market has collapsed, and rumors are rampant, causing public unrest. Therefore, trading has completely stopped.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market was volatile due to the political relationship between the Balkans and the Far East international situation, as well as the weakness of Wall Street stocks. As a result, closing prices were lower by 4 to 6 points compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian market was flat. Yesterday's forecasts showed little change.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trading market was confused by the instability in Shanghai, so cotton prices fell and no one cared.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Piece Goods: Cloth Market Weak; Eastern Cloth Continues to Fall <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's factory cloth market continued to be weak, as many holders were fearful and closed out their positions. Demand from customers was weak, with only traders making small purchases to cover positions. Therefore, the cloth market remained unsustainable. White cloth fine cloth and twill each fell by 5 jiao to 1 yuan per piece, coarse cloth fell by 2 jiao and a half to 5 jiao, and bleached and dyed cloth fell by about 1 yuan. Approximately 200 pieces of various fabrics were traded on the street. Sales to customers were sluggish, and they remained in a wait-and-see attitude, with only small amounts being purchased. Min and Yue merchants bought over 100 pieces of colored cloth and twill. Zhejiang, Ningbo, and Taizhou merchants bought fifty or sixty pieces of colored cloth and flannel. On the 15th, 55 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Yantai, and 110 pieces were shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<p>The rise in Eastern cloth prices has not ended. The morning market saw a sharp drop in yarn prices. The spot price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 45 yuan and 12 jiao. In the later market, small traders covered their positions, and sentiment slightly improved. The opening price rose to 45 yuan and 7 jiao. However, due to the lack of actual sales, it fell back to 45 yuan and 1 jiao and a half. The February futures closing price on the "Exchange" was 45 yuan and 9 jiao and 8 fen, also falling by 1 yuan and 1 fen per piece.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Sugar Market: Over 20,000 Bags of Dutch Sugar; Original Ship Returns; Market Prices Rise Significantly <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Dutch ship "Zhi Ba De," originally carrying over 10,000 bags of Dutch sugar from Java to Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai last night. However, it received orders to sail to Fiji, so it did not unload and continued to Hong Kong. Therefore, the sugar market believed that the supply source might be disrupted, leading to a general upward trend. The association's clearing prices for spot goods were 24 crude white, 83 yuan to 86 yuan and a half in local warehouses, up 5 yuan and a half, 82 yuan and a half to 86 yuan in foreign warehouses, up about 5 yuan, 81 yuan and 2 jiao to 84 yuan for goods on the way, 62 yuan to 65 yuan for Dutch red, up 2 yuan and a half, 80 yuan and 2 jiao to 85 yuan for Taikoo car white B mark, up 5 yuan and 2 jiao, and 80 yuan to 82 yuan for DY mark, up 3 yuan and 6 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Coal: Japanese Coal Prices Rise by 10%; Transactions are Significantly Different from the Past <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Imported bituminous coal prices have generally fallen due to the easing of exchange rates, which reduced costs. However, Japanese coal prices have risen by 10% in a week due to the rise in military currency. Keelung lump coal is priced at 188 yuan per ton, fines at 150 yuan, and Huainan lump coal at 175 yuan. As a result, transactions have been sluggish, and the volume is significantly less than in the past.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Medicinal Materials: Lily Bulb Slices Rise Quietly <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Lily bulb slices are extremely scarce and market inventories are depleted. Therefore, both buyers and sellers treat them as rare goods. Yesterday, it was heard that prices among traders had quietly risen by more than 10 yuan, reaching 100 yuan. This has led to an upside-down situation in supply and demand.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Miscellaneous: Cigarette Consumption is Astonishing; Everyone in the Industry Profits <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The cigarette leaf market in 1940 can be described as prosperous, with prices reaching record highs. All brands have risen by more than 60%. The reason is that the production areas of cigarette leaves are all in occupied areas, and transportation costs to Shanghai are huge. Raw materials for packaging all rely on foreign supplies, and exchange rates have repeatedly plummeted. Therefore, the cost of producing cigarettes is enormous, and prices have risen across the board. Production has also been reduced, and market sales are often in short supply. Therefore, market prices are volatile. After the red disc opening price, taking the Great Britain brand as an example, the price was 700 yuan. Later, sales in various regions were extremely active, and merchants purchased heavily. Traders often searched the market, exceeding the official prices, and the gray market soared. In mid-May, it reached a high of 1,175 yuan. Later, due to the high price, speculators rushed to sell, and the market was affected by the control measures, requiring "removal permits" for sales to other regions, which softened public sentiment. The price was held around 950 yuan. After entering winter, sales in various regions became active again. Traders in other regions, who had benefited greatly from forming joint ventures with a certain party, searched the Shanghai market, and the price rose again to 1,300 yuan. By the end of the year, the closing price had risen by another 5 or 60 yuan. Overall, prices rose more than they fell, and operators made profits of over 300,000 yuan, followed by 100,000 yuan to 60,000 yuan. There are 110 large trading houses in the city, with an average daily turnover of over 5,000 yuan. Looking at the total number for the year, the amount of cigarette consumption is truly astonishing.</p>

<p>Since the American Consulate General in Shanghai reiterated its advice to American women, children, and American residents who must remain in Shanghai to evacuate quickly from Shanghai the day before yesterday, all sectors of society, both Chinese and foreign, have been extremely concerned about this news. A reporter from this newspaper specifically inquired with the largest American shipping agency in the city yesterday. It was reported that the number of people booking cabins to America yesterday was indeed more than usual. The most recent mail ship from Shanghai to America is the President Coolidge, which is scheduled to depart on February 25. It is said that most of the cabins have already been booked. This shows that the American community is taking the advice of the American Consulate seriously. It is heard that in the shortest period, about 500 American residents can evacuate from Shanghai.</p>
<p>Notification is Purely Advisory in Nature</p>
<p>A reporter from the Paiming News Agency raised several questions with the American Consulate yesterday. The spokesperson replied that the reiterated evacuation notice was a piece of advice and not an evacuation order. However, it is hoped that American residents who do not need to stay in Shanghai should evacuate. The American citizens under the jurisdiction of the American Consulate in Shanghai, in addition to those in Shanghai, also include some American residents in nearby outer ports. The total number is roughly 1,500 women and children, and over 1,000 men, totaling about 2,800.</p>
<p>Garrison Troops Stationed in Shanghai Not Being Transferred</p>
<p>Since the American Consulate reiterated its advice for evacuation, rumors of the American garrison in Shanghai, the Marines, also considering withdrawal have spread. The reporter specifically inquired about this. It was reported that the Consulate had no knowledge of the American garrison in Shanghai considering withdrawal. It may be a mistake based on reports of a small number of replacements. As for the acceptance of the advice and voluntary evacuation by American residents, the government does not intend to dispatch special ships for transportation. However, it is advised to leave as soon as possible while transportation is convenient.</p>
<p>About 500 People Returning to America Recently</p>
<p>The English-language Great America Evening News reported that, according to an official at the American Consulate General in the city, after the American citizens residing in the consulate's jurisdiction were advised by the U.S. State Department to evacuate, they had not yet decided what to do because most American residents could not afford the large cost of travel. Since the last State Department order, about 1,600 people, mostly women and children, had returned to the United States. Currently, about 2,800 American residents remain in Shanghai, of whom only about 500 can return to the United States in the near future.</p>
<p>Warning Japan is of Great Significance</p>
<p>The English-language Great America Evening News published an article yesterday commenting on the American Consulate General in Shanghai's issuance of a notice reiterating its advice to American women, children, and American residents who do not need to stay in Shanghai to return to their country. It stated that this move by the American Consulate General in Shanghai indicates that "Uncle Sam is not one to joke around." The notice stated, "This advice is a necessary precautionary measure taken for the safety and convenience of American citizens themselves and the country." Its meaning is extremely clear. In the current situation, the personal safety of American residents is sufficient for the U.S. government to take this action. However, we are inclined to view its main reason as being based on national policy. The American evacuation is particularly important to Japan. Japanese officials certainly hope to reduce the seriousness of this matter, fearing that if the Japanese people know that the United States is preparing for war in the Pacific, they will be struck like a bolt from the blue. They will be unable to stop the recklessness of the military. We believe that the State Department's evacuation notice, in addition to informing the American community, also contains a meaning of determination towards Japan. Although we cannot prove this point, we have reason to deeply believe it. We think that American residents, after reading this advice, should know its surface-level meaning is that American residents who do not need to stay should evacuate from the Far East. The notice states, "Now the State Department does not intend to dispatch special ships to assist in the evacuation, which proves that there is no 'extreme urgency' to complete this action quickly." The newspaper advised American residents staying in Shanghai not to easily abandon their responsibilities here, saying that American residents who must stay here should have the determination to fight for their rights and property until the United States enters the war. The consulate's advice is only a reiteration of previous advice and does not intend to expand past policies. Therefore, we believe that the overall situation has not changed much. (According to the Zi Lin Western Newspaper yesterday, the U.S. State Department advised American residents who did not need to stay in the Far East to evacuate last October. At that time, 1,500 American residents took the three special ships dispatched by the U.S. government, the President Monde莱, the Ma列波 (blank)号, and the Washington, to evacuate from the Far East. A small number of American residents returned to their country on Japanese ships.)</p>
<h3 id="e56">Cigarette Prices Soar; Tobacco Merchants Hit Hard <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The number of cigarettes consumed is truly astonishing. Currently, the prices of various cigarettes are soaring, especially foreign cigarettes, which are rising unbelievably. Chinese-made cigarettes previously mostly purchased Henan Xuchang leaves, Qingzhou leaves, and American Virginia tobacco leaves, blended and manufactured. After the war, Xuchang leaves need to be transported from the occupied area to Shanghai, which is not easy to achieve. Therefore, the only leaves currently used by various Chinese factories are Anhui Fengyang leaves and miscellaneous leaves planted by Chinese and Japanese partners elsewhere, with orders for Indian leaves being the majority. As for the increase in prices, tobacco leaves have risen five to six times compared to before the war, and cigarette paper has suddenly increased more than ten times. As for donations and taxes, the standard has always been 50 out of 100, but the situation in the three major regions of South China, Central China, and North China is different. There are even those who charge 80 out of 100. Regardless of Chinese or foreign cigarettes, those transported to occupied areas for sale are charged a certain amount per box by the "China Branch Association". Therefore, due to this stacking of costs, prices have to rise. In terms of operations, compared to before the war, it has been reduced by about two-thirds. Because it is not easy to transport and sell to occupied areas, Chinese merchants in the city have been hit hard.</p>

<p>Mourning the Death of Jin Huating</p>
<p>The Chongqing China Youth News Reporters' Association quickly wired Shanghai's news colleagues, saying: The news of Mr. Huating's death has arrived, and our association is deeply saddened. In the past two years, Shanghai colleagues and association members have suffered setbacks, but they have still adhered to the anti-Japanese propaganda of the isolated island, were not tempted by profit, and did not grow powerful. For the sake of the victory of the anti-Japanese national freedom, they fell and rose again, fighting harder and stronger. This great spirit has always been admired by our colleagues and compatriots in the rear. At this time, when the situation is not yet settled and the final victory awaits our continued efforts, we hope to make persistent efforts and make more arduous and lasting struggles. The China Youth News Reporters' Association bows from the Chongqing Secretariat.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Temporary Centralization is not Highly Effective; Dutch Ships Ordered to Stop Sailing; Zhi Zha Lian Jia Has Already Stopped Sailing to Hong Kong; Zhi Ba De Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday and Left for Africa in the Evening; Shipping Lines Between Shanghai and Africa Also Suspended <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The Dutch Java Mailboat Company's manager stated that the Dutch mailboats operating in the Far East, since the end of the war in the Netherlands last year, had been ordered by the governments of Britain and the Netherlands to only operate within the East China Sea east of Hong Kong. Therefore, Dutch ships between the city and Hong Kong are still sailing as usual, carrying passengers and goods.</p>
<p>Dutch Ships En Route Centralized in the Philippines</p>
<p>Recently, the situation in the Pacific has become increasingly tense, and Japan's desire to spy on the Dutch East Indies is becoming more active. The Dutch government stationed in London, in view of the worsening situation, has ordered all boats from 茶兰般 to avoid neutral country seaports in order to seek navigational safety. As a result, Dutch ships sailing between Hong Kong and Shanghai and within Japanese territorial waters are subject to restrictions. According to news from the Java Mailboat Company yesterday, the company also received the instruction yesterday morning. All Dutch ships, if they have left Java and are en route, are concentrated in the Philippines to await orders. Therefore, the regular Java mailboat, Zhi Zha Lian Jia, after arriving in the Philippines the day before yesterday, stopped heading north and anchored in the Philippines to await orders.</p>
<p>Zhi Ba De Left Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>The Zhi Ba De mailboat entered the port at 4:30 PM yesterday and sailed to the Pudong Blue Funnel Wharf at around 6:00 PM. In addition to transporting over 20,000 bags of sugar and over 100 boxes of rubber from Java, the ship also loaded a large quantity of foreign rice from Hong Kong, as many as over 30,000 bags. As it had received orders to urgently sail to the Philippines for assembly, all goods were not unloaded after arriving in Shanghai last night. After the passengers left the ship, the ship weighed anchor and left Shanghai last night. All rice, sugar, and other goods were still taken to Hong Kong for unloading and storage.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Africa Shipping Lines Also Suspended</p>
<p>The Royal Company's Shanghai-Africa line ships have also been ordered to stop sailing. The Tegel Berg was originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong from the north yesterday and was expected to arrive in the city around the 18th. It is heard that it has been withdrawn to the Philippines midway. Therefore, Dutch ships are in danger of suspending sailing.</p>
<p>Kang Tieluo Suo Has Been Sunk</p>
<p>Also, the Italian mailboat Kang Tieluo Suo, which previously sailed between Europe and Asia, was reported by London's Leixun yesterday to have been sunk by a torpedo in the Mediterranean Sea recently while carrying Italian soldiers. Inquiries with the Italian mailboat company in the city revealed that there was also news of this. The ship was one of Italy's largest mailboats, with a displacement of over 18,000 tons. It is a pity that it has suffered this misfortune. As for the Kang Tie Fo Tian, which previously sailed opposite the Kang Tieluo Suo, it has been moored in Shanghai since May of last year after being ordered to stop sailing. It is still moored at floats 15 and 16 in the Huangpu River. The ship will not be able to leave Shanghai until the end of the war.</p>

<p>Since the Masnan Road Post Office was inspected by Japanese personnel, there have been many inconveniences for Shanghai residents sending mail, and private rented mailboxes have also been under surveillance. At noon yesterday, more than a dozen plainclothes Japanese rushed in to search. As a result, a large number of printed materials and private letters, both local and destined for the southwest, were inspected. It is estimated that over a thousand items were inspected yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Key Daily Commodity Prices to be Strictly Controlled Soon; Control Measures Approved by French Consul-General; Regulations for Reorganizing the Rice Market to be Announced Shortly <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that, according to yesterday's (13th) news, the Price Control Committee of the French Concession, in order to curb merchants within the concession from hoarding and profiteering, is now planning to strictly control the prices of about thirty kinds of goods. After a detailed investigation of the current market situation, the committee has submitted several recommendations for control measures to the French Consul-General in Shanghai. The French Consulate has received these recommendations, and after careful study, it is said to have approved them. According to responsible sources, the committee is about to complete a notice, which will be announced within a few days to inform all merchants of the control measures that will soon be implemented in the French Concession.</p>
<p>Exceeding Price Limits Will Be Prosecuted</p>
<p>The committee will set maximum prices for thirty kinds of goods. Merchants who sell these goods at prices higher than the limit will be prosecuted. It is said that the goods whose prices will be controlled include rice, coal, coal briquettes, sugar, flour, wheat, firewood, oil, and vegetables. In the past few days, the prices of various foods in the French Concession have risen sharply. As of yesterday, they were twelve times more expensive than a month ago. However, it is expected that the announcement of control measures at this time is opportune and will force prices down. Responsible sources say that there is no shortage of various goods in this city, and the soaring prices are mostly due to merchants hoarding and manipulating the market.</p>
<p>Decision on Reconsideration of Rice Market Reorganization</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement suggested seven measures to the Rice Market Management Committee on the 6th of this month to reorganize the rice merchants' trading practices in the market. The Rice Market Management Committee held its 80th committee meeting on the 10th of this month, and after lengthy discussions, a tentative resolution was made after amending each measure. It was then submitted to the Bean and Rice Guild for reconsideration before being officially announced for implementation in the market. The Shanghai Bean and Rice Trade Association and the Rice Market Management Committee held a joint meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM on the third floor of 15 Edward Road to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>Investigating Names of Rice Traders</p>
<p>Seven draft resolutions, the Rice Market Management Committee submitted a proposal to the Shanghai Municipal Council, suggesting to review the proposal, after discussions and decisions, with the exception of items under discussion the remaining measures have been implemented. Regarding the third measure, committees Zhu Zi Xiang and Fu Qian Geng were assigned to visit Deputy General Manager He De Kui at 11:00 AM this morning for negotiations, before publicly announcing that the measure will be strictly enforced (According to the third measure suggested by the Council, each rice merchant should record the rice sold in books or invoices. Each transaction should be accompanied by three copies of the transaction note: one copy for the buyer, one copy for the market manager, and one copy for the seller. The transaction note must state the price, quantity, quality, and the names and addresses of both parties. The Council may send personnel to inspect all books, invoices, and transaction notes at any time). The issue of how to handle cases where foreign firms delayed delivery of futures contracts that were concluded last year in December, was resolved. It was decided that the Miscellaneous Grains Guild would send letters to the respective foreign firms to negotiate the fulfillment of the contracts and deliver the goods on schedule to meet market demand. Committee member Xing Zhi Gang proposed to increase the capital of the industry and then have the guild compile a directory of members to facilitate assessment, which was resolved. The deadline was set for the end of February for all members to register. Otherwise, starting from March 1st, the freedom to enter the market for trading would be revoked, and the issued market entry certificates would be taken back to prevent abuses. Other cases were omitted.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Large-Value Copper Block Theft Case; All Sold to the Japanese Side; Swiss National Whiteley Facilitated the Deal; Negotiations Concluded for a Value of Ten Million Yuan; Whiteley's Arrest Warrant to Be Withdrawn <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening News" reports that Swiss national Whiteley, who was accused of stealing copper blocks last year, has reached an agreement with the American firm Mow Sing Trading Co. in this city to sell copper blocks worth ten million yuan, currently stored in warehouses in the two concessions, to the Japanese authorities. Clay, the assistant manager of Mow Sing Trading Co., confirmed to reporters this morning (14th) that the negotiations for the transfer of the copper blocks, facilitated by Whiteley, have concluded.</p>
<p>Deal Reached It is said that the final details of this deal are still under negotiation. Mow Sing Trading Co. is awaiting a telegram from its New York headquarters for final approval, which is expected to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon or tomorrow (15th). Whiteley claimed this morning that all parties involved have amicably resolved the entire issue, and everyone is satisfied. The price paid for these ten million yuan worth of copper blocks could not be ascertained today. It is only known that this transaction will include the copper blocks worth three million yuan that the Japanese authorities had already taken previously.</p>
<p>Withdrawal of Lawsuit Major Bowen, the Chief of the Shanghai Municipal Police, stated that he had received a letter from Nelson, the lawyer of Mow Sing Trading Co., stating that the company had withdrawn its previous lawsuit accusing Whiteley of copper theft. Clay also said that since the matter has been resolved, the lawsuit accusing Rueff Trading Co. of negligence, which led to the theft of copper stored in its warehouses last year, will also be withdrawn.</p>
<p>Negotiations Concluded Reliable sources say that Clay and Nelson, representing Mow Sing Trading Co., and Whiteley and a staff officer from the headquarters of the Japanese army in Central China, concluded negotiations yesterday to resolve the transfer of the copper blocks currently stored in warehouses in the two concessions. Clay and Nelson hosted a banquet last night at 10:00 PM at the Paramount Ballroom for Whiteley and several Japanese officials to celebrate the amicable resolution of the copper block deal. The banquet ended at 1:30 AM this morning.</p>
<p>Withdrawal of Arrest Warrant It is also reported that Mow Sing Trading Co. is currently withdrawing its previous lawsuit against Whiteley with the Swiss Consulate in Shanghai, and the arrest warrant for Whiteley will also be recalled. However, Major Bowen said this morning that he had not yet received notification from the Swiss Consulate to withdraw the arrest warrant.</p>

<p>Ms. Ge Wang, a 23-year-old woman from Ningbo, who lived at No. 21 Xingfu Village, Haig Road, had a quarrel with her husband over trivial family matters yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM. Afterwards, Ms. Wang secretly drank poisonous liquid and committed suicide. She was discovered and rushed to the hospital for treatment, but her life is in critical condition.</p>
<p>Ms. Chen Yuan, a 48-year-old woman residing at No. 160 Dalian Bay Road, Hongkou District, had a quarrel with her husband over a minor matter the day before. In a moment of anger, she drank poison at home yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM in an attempt to end her life. She was discovered by her family and urgently summoned an ambulance to rush her to Hongkou Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>At 7:15 AM yesterday morning, a Russian woman residing at No. 881 Gordon Road, International Settlement, had a dispute with her husband at home and suddenly hanged herself in the room. When her husband discovered her, he broke down the door and found that she had been dead for a long time. He summoned a vehicle to transport her to the mortuary for examination.</p>

<p>Over 300 workers at the American United Industries (formerly the Sanxing Toothpaste Factory) located at Nos. 150, 140, and 220 Lou Lang Road and No. 30 Singapore Road, jointly submitted a request to the management to improve their living conditions. The representatives they elected were dismissed by the factory. Upon hearing the news, all the workers were panic-stricken and went on strike. They then submitted eight more demands, including: (1) reinstate the dismissed representatives; (2) increase the living allowance by 40 cents; (3) provide 2 dou of rice allowance per month; (4) change working hours to 8 hours; (5) workers who have worked for 3 years or more will receive severance pay upon resignation; (6) add one month's salary each year; (7) all previously agreed-upon favorable treatment for special workers shall not be changed; (8) workers shall not be dismissed without cause. Unexpectedly, the factory not only delayed responding but also hired a new batch of workers to work. Yesterday morning, the factory came to the factory to pick up Hakka orders, and a conflict broke out when old workers prevented them. The factory then reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, which dispatched a large number of police officers and red police cars to suppress the unrest. As a result, six workers were arrested, and the labor strike escalated.</p>
<p>Postal Workers Re-Submit Subsidy Plan</p>
<p>Due to the impact of high prices, postal workers and messengers in all branches and offices of the Shanghai Postal Administration have found it difficult to make a living. They have separately requested the postal workers' union to ask the authorities to increase living allowance subsidies. The union had previously negotiated this matter and exchanged views with a friendly union (the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union). At the 8th meeting of the board of directors and supervisors held by the union the other day, the General Affairs Section reported that regarding this request to increase living allowance subsidies, the union had previously sent a letter to the friendly union to carry out the request jointly. After another conversation, they exchanged opinions, but the results were inconsistent. The union has now decided to make a request independently. The method is based on the resolution of the 7th joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors to gradually increase the temporary living relief subsidy of 15 yuan, according to the multiple of the Shanghai English Council's living index with 30 yuan per grade. When the 15-yuan living relief subsidy was issued in November of the 28th year of the Republic of China, the living index was 250 percent. At present, the cost of living should be expanded to 115 yuan (including the previous 15 yuan). This plan has now been submitted to the authorities, and the director is requested to do his utmost to recommend it to the General Administration to strive for a satisfactory solution as soon as possible.</p>
<p>A Barber Shop Destroyed Yesterday</p>
<p>The barbers in six first-class barber shops in the Avenue Joffre area of the French Concession suddenly went on strike again a few days ago, and the strike has not yet been resolved. At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, more than ten barbers broke into a barber shop at No. 847 Chengdu Road and destroyed all the items. Afterwards, someone reported to the police, who dispatched detectives to the scene, and the barbers dispersed.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Domestic Goods for Sale in Inland China Must Have Certificate from Chamber of Commerce; Merchants in This City Have Encountered Difficulties in Recent Days <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening News" reports that manufacturers in this city are encountering difficulties because they cannot obtain certificates of origin anywhere other than the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, as the Hong Kong Road Chamber of Commerce office was once occupied. All domestic products transported to Free China and overseas must be issued a certificate by the Chamber of Commerce. Otherwise, they are strictly prohibited from being transported to Free China for sale. Now that merchants in this city have no way of obtaining this certificate, the export of goods to Free China has completely stopped. It is not difficult for merchants to obtain certificates from the controlled "Chamber of Commerce," but goods transported to Free China with such certificates will certainly not be permitted by the Chongqing authorities. It is rumored that manufacturers in this city will apply for certificates of origin from the Hong Kong office of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, but this has not been confirmed this morning. According to a Li Pi manufacturer who spoke to reporters, cloth merchants have not signed any sales orders in the past two days. This situation is not expected to improve in the short term. The drop in cotton yarn prices in the past two days has also been driven by this situation.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Preface to the "Complete Record of the European War" <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The "Complete Record of the European War" published by this newspaper is exceptionally rich in content, with over two hundred pages and two hundred thousand words. The articles collected are complete from beginning to end and tell a coherent story, making for interesting reading and increasing knowledge, which is essential for those who are interested in international current affairs. The preface at the beginning of the volume details the purpose of publishing this book, the breadth of the content collected, and the arduousness of the compilation and translation work. The original preface is reproduced below:</p>
<p>"How did Nazi Germany rise so violently? It can be said to be unprecedented. In the war from 1914 to 1918, they were defeated by the Allied forces as the head of the military. The national strength was exhausted, and the peace treaty shackled and exploited them to the extreme. They lost more than 27,000 square miles of territory in Europe, as well as all overseas colonies. The reparations were approximately 33 billion US dollars. Merchant ships were used for compensation, coal production was given to other countries for ten years, 5,000 railway locomotives, 150,000 passenger and freight cars, and all remaining military supplies were dedicated to the Allied forces. Several important management rights related to the economy were handed over to the League of Nations. From then on, no fortifications were allowed on the banks of the Rhine, the number of troops was limited to 100,000, the air force was banned, and warships all sank to the bottom of the sea. The rivers and mountains were shattered, not only were territories ceded, but the province of East Prussia was split into two parts, surrounded by strong opponents such as France and Italy during the war, and new small countries after the war, such as Lithuania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, were all supported by Britain and France, and were like hawks and dogs. In short, although Germany did not perish at that time, the terms of the peace treaty made the German people and their descendants live like cattle and horses, and they would still be unbearable, let alone seek strength and hegemony. After the peace, although the terms of the peace treaty were not fully implemented, the people were haggard, political changes were frequent, and the national affairs were in turmoil for more than ten years. It was only in 1933 that Hitler led the Nazi Party to power. They recuperated and learned lessons, and then rose to prominence; they annexed Austria and deployed troops to the Rhine, and the international community became awed; they demanded Memel, and Lithuania offered it with both hands; they first cleverly seized the Sudetenland, and then swallowed Czechoslovakia, and Britain and France bowed their heads and acted as accomplices, and their brilliance was boundless. All this expansion was done without bloodshed. Due to international conflicts, they were given an opportunity, and they were able to win without fighting because of the rapid advancement of national strength. Therefore, on the day when they had to use war as a tool, they destroyed Poland in one fell swoop, and took Denmark and Norway to the north. When they pointed their troops to the west, countries such as Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium could not withstand their offensive. France, one of the world's powers, and known as the world's first army, was like destroying dry weeds when the German army approached. How could this be achieved if the national strength was not strong? In total, from the time the Nazis came to power to the use of force against Poland, it was only six years: from the attack on Poland to the defeat of France, it was less than a year. Although aggression is not to be followed and the ending is not optimistic, it is truly remarkable that they could revive themselves from ruin and weakness, and then become powerful overseas, as if with divine help. What is the purpose of life? What is the purpose of establishing oneself? There are many disputes, and the views of the benevolent and the wise differ. Are the Germans and the British and French very different? The Versailles Treaty completely obliterated President Wilson's principles, and only focused on punishing the head of the military. Although the Germans suffered deeply, they never learned from the past and regretted their mistakes, nor did they want to give up military force and live in peace. They firmly believed that they had regretted being defeated in the past, not because of the sins of war. Therefore, they devoted all their manpower and material resources to war preparations. Under the belief that war preparations come first, their people were never out of hardship, and their country was never out of progress. As for Britain and France, they won the hard-fought victory and were complacent. What they dreamed of was to get it over with once and for all. With the League of Nations to manipulate, they were confident in international competition: with resources to monopolize, they were confident in living behind barriers: with the Maginot Line to defend, they were confident in fighting, and with weak nations to sacrifice, they were confident in appeasing them. From the Treaty of Versailles to the Munich Agreement, they indulged in a good dream. Therefore, there was a villain in the Far East who was not hated like an enemy, and there was a hidden danger in Europe that was not prevented before it happened. The alarm of the September 18th Incident spread to Africa and then to Europe, and the successive warnings were not enough to alert them. They only knew to curse the killings and destruction of war, and they thought that following conventions and making compromises was the right strategy. They did not know that only by respecting international justice and fairness could they achieve long-term peace and stability. Seeing what is right and acting bravely, sacrificing one's life for righteousness, and not hesitating to kill for benevolence are essential aspects of war. To fail to do these things is not only rewarding evil, but also regretting it too late. Although the Nazis' initiation of international conflict was still a matter of last year, their rise to power in the country was two years after the September 18th Incident. The causes are different, but the international atmosphere created by Britain and France helped the success of Nazi politics. When they suddenly realized that the tiger had been released from its cage, their war preparations were relatively weak. The tragedies of the past year were caused by this. The cause and effect are clear, and it is deplorable. Among the tragedies, France was the most tragic, but on the eve of Pétain's seeking peace, who would have expected this? When Verdun announced that it was seeking peace, the impression it gave to the world was: some thought that Germany's national strength was like a superhuman, and that the national system should be like that of the Nazis, and that the fate of mankind would be kneeling to the Nazis, and that Hitler almost possessed the destiny of dominating mankind; or that France was founded in the extravagant and licentious night of Paris, and that its people were all dandies, and even if there were outstanding politicians and military strategists who were devoted to their duty, they could not turn the tide; or that Britain was unfaithful and betrayed its promises, allowing its allies to bear the hardships alone, sitting idly by and not saving them, until they were destroyed; or that the Soviet Union sincerely and wholeheartedly backed Germany, and that the United States had no love for Britain and France from the beginning, watching the fire from across the river, which was the deciding factor in the battle; or that the victory or defeat was determined by strategy, and that strategic mistakes were accidental, and that Germany's victory and France's defeat were accidental. All these impressions are ambiguous and contradictory: however, the fact that France's defeat was unexpected by the world seems that it is impossible to explain it without mixing ambiguity and contradiction into one. Alas, war is a major event, a major change of prosperity and decline, and with the solemnity of history, how can there be a page of ambiguity and contradiction! The "Shen Bao" takes focusing on international issues as one of its editorial guidelines. At ordinary times, it collects overseas news extensively and selects it carefully. This time, the outbreak of the European War is regrettable because the telegrams are countless fragments, only describing the superficial evolution, which is rich and fast, but what is the whole picture of the European War? What are the inside stories? What is the basic tone of the static state? What are the active personnel? What are the distant causes and recent consequences? What are the influences and reactions of the countries outside the warring countries that are closely related to the war situation? I deeply know that readers will not be satisfied with only getting telegrams, and that newspapers will not be exhausted by only publishing telegrams. I love to collect European and American newspapers and magazines in many ways, and select the authors who are not responsible for propaganda, but who are in the military, political, and diplomatic aspects of this war, either personally experiencing the situation, or participating in the battle. Their words are credible, and their deeds have not been done by others, and others cannot do their deeds. And what they say is what those who are concerned about world affairs want to know. The colleagues of the "Shen Bao" are divided into translations, which are published in the newspaper one after another. Over time, the quality and quantity are considerable; the content is like a string of pearls, forming a system, which is not only enough to answer the big question of why Germany rose and why France failed, but also a multi-faceted modern historical material. Readers praised it, and did not think that it was enough to read it in succession, and the letters urged the compilation and publication. The text can be passed on, and the righteousness cannot be resigned. As of November of this year, 30 articles were compiled into one volume, called "Complete Record of the European War." At that time, it was obvious that Germany's blitzkrieg tactics were ineffective against Britain, but German aircraft were still bombing London non-stop, and the European War was still spreading. After this volume, there must be a sequel. How can we have a fair mediator, repent of the disaster, and not wait for three or four records? Pan Gongbi Preface at Zhi Zhi Lou.</p>

<p>(Jinhua Correspondence) The Ministry of Education is paying considerable attention to resolving employment issues for students in the war zone after graduation, as well as providing guidance and financial assistance for studying in the interior.

<h3 id="e89">Manager Rong <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Shui Rong</p>
<p>In terms of calculation, Manager Rong and I are close relatives. However, I don't often associate with him. I don't like the airs of rich people. Also, their unique ideas." However, I am very familiar with his only son, Juemin, which is entirely because we are both young people and share the same interests.</p>
<p>I have seen many conflicts between fathers and sons. (How avoidable that seems!) I also saw this conflict in the Rong father and son. The son obviously did not approve of his father's behavior, and at any time and any place, he adopted a fighting, uncompromising attitude. So the father, like a defeated rooster, lonely stroked an injured heart.</p>
<p>To me, "Juemin" rarely mentioned his father. Only once did he suddenly say, dejectedly, almost to himself, "Father got a mistress."</p>
<p>"Doesn't your mother know?" I heard that his mother was a famous shrew.</p>
<p>He shook his head. "Secret."</p>
<p>Among our few friends, there was a girl named Shen Hui. She was a very lovely girl. Because of being classmates, she was often with Juemin. Gradually the two fell in love. Shen Hui had been to the Rong residence many times. Perhaps due to "deep maternal love," Juemin's mother took a liking to Shen Hui at first sight. However, Manager Rong, after many inquiries, this time exceptionally defied his wife's orders and strongly opposed it.</p>
<p>One day, he suddenly sent someone to "invite" me. "I really can't think of anyone else," he said, handing me a cigarette. "Only you can persuade him. He is more likely to listen to you. There is no wrong in parents! That girl's family has problems, let alone she herself is so frivolous! Originally, Chen, the manager of Fa Yang Company, had already asked someone to propose marriage, his third daughter. The photos were also brought, and her appearance is not bad. I am not greedy for the dowry, but it must be a good match. The little ones all said: I only have an empty field, strong on the outside but weak on the inside; in the future, after I die, Juemin will have someone to rely on. "People look up high, water looks down," I said to Juemin, you might as well get engaged first. Once you are engaged, you can communicate and visit each other, but he doesn't agree!"</p>
<p>"What you say is correct." I spit out a puff of blue smoke, stammering. "However, I think it's a bit much, too silly, for parents not to let their children make their own decisions about marriage. If it's good, it's fine; if it's bad, the blame is real!"</p>
<p>"That's because you haven't become a parent yet!" Saying that, he laughed. Then, with thick lips, he noisily sipped a few mouthfuls of fresh Dendrobium tea. "Our Juemin is good at everything, studies hard, and also acts like a human being; but there is one thing: he is always silent." Then he said a lot of reproachful words.</p>
<p>I silently smoked my cigarette. He intentionally taught me a lesson, but I didn't refute it. I believed in Saint-Beuve's saying that "silence is the highest contempt."</p>
<p>After some days, I was "invited" again. This time, he slumped in a sofa, his two thick eyebrows knitted together. His pair of gray eyes looked at me sadly, his right hand trembling as he handed me a piece of paper. "Look, there is such a thing! I never dreamed of it! What to do? Maybe he's still in Shanghai, how can he leave without money? I really never dreamed of it!"</p>
<p>I read that letter. That neat handwriting was familiar to me. In fact, I had read such letters more than once. This was often used to end father-son conflicts!</p>
<p>"Could it be because of that marriage?"</p>
<p>I shook my head. Finally, I suggested "posting a notice in the newspaper to find him." He asked me to draft it. Naturally, the result was as expected.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I met him on the street. Behind him followed a tall bodyguard. Manager Rong smiled and took my hand: "Long time no see. Let me tell you, I received a letter from him! From Juemin! It was sent from the occupied area. He is now in the Hebei guerrilla team. He wants me to send him some money. Look, to save the country, you still have to dig into your own pockets! This time he went there, he used the money of friends who went with him along the way. Alas, it's really hard to understand! I'm going to remit 200 yuan, and I also plan to write a letter to him.

<p>— Liao Ling</p>
<p>If life is a small boat drifting in the stormy sea, then will is like a helmsman - a stubborn will is a brave and experienced helmsman, not in danger of capsizing.</p>
<p>Enduring hardship, perseverance, concentration, and fighting spirit are the key elements to success.</p>
<p>Calmness, consideration, alertness, and good judgment are the attitudes one should have in handling matters.</p>
<p>Do not worry, do not sigh, only hold optimism.</p>
<p>People without individuality, belief, or doctrine cannot become great figures.</p>

<p>Director Ma's heart suddenly felt cold.</p>
<p>"Then please ask the girl to talk to her father, okay?" Madam Ma suggested enthusiastically.</p>
<p>"This... this may be a bit inconvenient!" Principal Hou is an old maid, and she still takes the boundaries between men and women very seriously.</p>
<p>"Doesn't she have a mother?" Director Ma twisted his mustache and asked.</p>
<p>"She is an immobile paralytic." Principal Hou said with great emotion: "Speaking of the truth, her family is indeed very pitiful. If Xiangqi doesn't marry a rich husband, she simply won't be able to survive."</p>
<p>"So, we are not only doing it for ourselves, but also partly for her!" Director Ma said compassionately.</p>
<p>"Then, would it be possible to ask her father to come to the school to talk? If the girl alone is unwilling, anyway, I am free all day long, so let me accompany you...?"</p>
<p>"Wait!" Director Ma suddenly interrupted his wife. "What's the use of you going? I have come up with a plan! As long as my cousin writes a letter first and invites this old gentleman to the school, I can say everything to him; and I believe there must be a way to make him agree!"</p>
<p>Principal Hou lowered her head and thought silently for a long time.</p>
<p>"It is naturally good to do this. But on the side of Garrison Commander Yuan, you also have to give them a definite answer, tell them that the betrothal gifts must be generous, and that he must be responsible for the Luo family's life after marriage. Only in this way will we not lose our good intentions towards Xiangqi."</p>
<p>Three days later, Mr. Luo indeed responded to Principal Hou's invitation and came to the Provincial Women's Normal School to have a full ninety-plus minutes of negotiations with Director Ma and Principal Hou.</p>
<p>At that time, Luo Xiangqi had already moved from the school back home. Although Principal Hou's letter to her father did not state the reason, it was not difficult to guess, because Xiangqi also knew that her father had once sought help from Principal Hou for her future. Therefore, in her estimation, Principal Hou's letter inviting her to talk was of course also for employment issues. (31)</p>

<p>— Lan Hai</p>
<p>Four years ago, in the summer, I went to visit Old Man Wang, who was also staying at Kuling for the summer, and unfortunately, I received the news of the death of my god-sister, his daughter. Old Man Wang, with tears in his eyes, gave me a letter, saying that this was sent by Sister Ruo from the Union Hospital before her death, instructing him to personally give it to me no matter what. In the letter, she transcribed the original text of the following poem, asking me to be forever happy, forever brave, and never discouraged, and asking me to go to Beiping again when I had the opportunity - my birthplace, her place of death - and read it to her in front of her tomb.</p>
<p>That year, after I returned to Shanghai from Kuling, I fell seriously ill, and this poem gave me a lot of comfort during my illness. This poem later also enabled me to get the first place in school. Before, I recited this poem that my deceased sister copied almost every day, until I was admitted to the "university famous for its exams" two years ago and started fighting with scores all day long, then I hid the letter.</p>
<p>Last semester, unfortunately, I failed three subjects. Today, I borrowed notes from two female classmates who were good at their studies to prepare for the make-up exams, and I ran into a snag. Tonight, with mixed feelings, I couldn't help but find this poem and recite it wildly, and started doing the so-called "translation" work. I believe that this poem can encourage me and comfort me. I hope that my translation can also comfort others, so I am publishing it:</p>
<p>Suppose by Phoebe Cary</p>
<p>Suppose your doll's head broke off,</p>
<p>My little girl,</p>
<p>Though you cry till your eyes and nose are red, can you fix it?</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be happier this way?</p>
<p>Treat it as a joke</p>
<p>And say you're happy,</p>
<p>It's the doll's head, not yours, that broke.</p>
<p>Suppose you're dressed and ready for a walk but it suddenly rains heavily,</p>
<p>Because of your frowning and scolding, will the rain stop sooner?</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be better this way?</p>
<p>You still smile and don't pout,</p>
<p>So that the house seems full of sunshine,</p>
<p>Even though there is no sun outside.</p>
<p>Suppose your homework is very difficult,</p>
<p>My boy,</p>
<p>Can you reduce its difficulty slightly by sitting there upset?</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be smarter this way?</p>
<p>Work earnestly,</p>
<p>Instead of waiting like an idiot to learn it right away.</p>
<p>Suppose this world doesn't please you, you're not happy with people's actions,</p>
<p>But do you think the creator will change the world,</p>
<p>To suit your wishes?</p>
<p>Isn't this the smartest and bravest way?</p>
<p>My children,</p>
<p>No matter what the outcome,</p>
<p>You always do your best!</p>

<h3 id="e93">Price Increase for Actors <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Wo</p>
<p>At a time when prices are rising for everything, it is hard to believe, but the fees for actors have also skyrocketed several times. This refers to the so-called "Beijing actors" in the North. In the past, when they came to Shanghai, they habitually "asked for the moon," demanding huge fees. Now, huge fees are being raised several times over. For example, take the male actor Yang Baosen. The first time he took the Golden stage, his fee was 1,500. The second time, it rose to 2,000. The third time, it rose another 500. The boss saw that he could draw a crowd, so he added another 500 in red envelopes, making it 3,000. In recent years, when Yang Baosen came south, his fee was based on this standard. After he returned north from Shanghai last year, he started his own company with Zhang Yijun, and became a leading actor himself. Once he climbed the dragon gate, his value increased a hundredfold. The Golden side wanted to invite him again, and after sending someone to negotiate with him, this Mr. Yang opened his mouth and asked for 10,000. He said, "You can talk about friendship for anything, but not for eating." He simply wouldn't accept a penny less. In addition, there is the female actor Hou Yulan, who is now one of the most popular second-tier female actors in the North. The first time she came south, her fee was less than 2,000. Now, she won't come south for less than three 2,000's. The fees for "Beijing actors" tend to rise with the price of gold. Perhaps their fees will have a market price in the future, but if this continues, the people of Shanghai will eventually "block" the "Beijing actors" and tell them that they don't need to come again.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Xun Huisheng Comes South <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Among the Four Great Dan, only Xun Huisheng has not come south to perform for a long time. It has been eight years since Huisheng and the people of Shanghai parted ways. Last year, the Golden Renewal two theaters competed to invite this person, but it never happened. Now the news has spread that Huisheng has responded to Golden's invitation and will come south to perform at the beginning of next month. As for the supporting roles, the male actor was originally Wang Wenyuan (also known as Wu Lingtong), but Wang's acting is not desirable, and people here fear that he will not be able to draw a crowd, so there is an intention to invite someone else. It is possible that the comedian Ma Fulu, his old partner, will come with him, but the young actor Yu Zhongren has been separated from Huisheng for a long time, so the people of Shanghai will not be able to see these two work together again, which is a bit of a pity. As for the ticket price, it has been set at 6 yuan, which is more expensive than Cheng Yanqiu's last time. This is also the way that the fees for actors have increased, and the tide has risen along with the boat.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Marriage and Status of Movie Stars Are Unrelated <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Jia</p>
<p>Dou Ping's Parents Have Announced Their Beloved Daughter's Wedding Date, Dispelling the Hidden Worry That Stars Cannot Marry, Shu Jia</p>
<p>The news of the mature romance between Deanna Durbin, the "cash cow" of Universal Pictures, and Vaughn Paul has been circulating globally for some time. However, the boss of Universal Pictures has been worried and hesitant for a long time before finally allowing Dou Ping's parents to officially announce that their beloved daughter will marry Paul. The reason for this is not that the boss of Universal Pictures doesn't approve of Paul. To be honest, Li Li from Beiping returned to Hong Kong after filming "Burning the Biyun Temple" at Yihua, and there has been no news of her since. However, she suddenly returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday and is said to be going back to the Paramount Ballroom to resume her career as a dance hostess. Speaking of which, Paul is indeed a talented and handsome young man, and his marriage to Dou Ping is truly a perfect match. However, Dou Ping is the ideal lover in the eyes of millions of movie fans, and once she gets married, whether it will be harmful to her future is indeed a question that requires careful consideration.</p>
<p>It may make the boss of Universal Pictures laugh, but movie fans have long been familiar with the news that Dou Ping will have good news, and they all express their welcome once they hear the confirmed news. Some cinemas in the United States solemnly announced the news of Dou Ping and Paul's engagement, and the audience responded with warm applause. When the boss of Universal Pictures hears this report, he can believe that the audience welcomes Dou Ping's lifelong commitment, and marriage will definitely not harm her career.</p>
<p>The era of "stars must maintain their position in the film industry and must not marry" is over. Although Dou Ping is a famous star, she is already a grown-up girl, and of course,</p>

<p>— Shou Wu</p>
<p>Chen Qi's contract with He Company expires at the end of this month and he has decided not to continue. The new contract with Jin Xing has also been signed a few days ago. Chen Qi originally had an important role in the fashion play starring Ying Yin, but now he will also resign.</p>
<p>Jin Xing plans to produce several films in 1941 and also has ambitious plans to build his own studio.</p>
<p>Wang Yin is self-financing the production of "Soul Returns to Lihantian," and the story is similar to "Resurrection."</p>
<p>Reliable sources say that the banking community in Chongqing plans to invest in the organization of a professional theater troupe and invite Ying Yunwei to take charge of everything. The method will imitate the amateur theater troupe of that year. If successful, it will at least be beneficial to raising standards.</p>
<p>According to the above news, the rumor that Ying Yunwei has left Chongqing for Hong Kong is self-defeating. Also, the couple Jin Yan and Wang Renmei arrived in Hong Kong as early as a month ago, but because few people outside knew about it, it was only recently known to the Shanghai press, so some newspapers mistakenly thought that they had only recently arrived in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The rumor that Sun Jinglu will marry Wu Jingping seems to be based on fact. Wu Chengda has been very busy lately. They should enjoy the happiness that butterflies bring, and how could movie fans not understand this at all?</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are countless examples of movie stars whose reputation has not declined after marriage, but has instead made significant progress. In the past, some people said that after famous male and female stars engaged in cohabitation, one of the two would inevitably suffer a decline in reputation and never recover. This statement has now been broken by facts. Now, let's give a few examples of stars who have become even more popular with audiences after marriage.</p>
<p>Ida Lupino wandered around Hollywood for many years, just doing average, and Louis Hayward also did not achieve remarkable success, but after they got married, it was as if there was some kind of miracle, and they suddenly soared. It turned out that Ida received extremely high praise after playing "The Light That Failed" and instantly jumped to the throne of a first-class star. Louis's acting skills in "My Son, My Son!" were exquisite, and he had a very high chance of winning an Academy Award.</p>
<p>After Carole Lombard and Clark Gable got married, not only did it not affect their status in the film industry, but they also made even greater progress. Carole's acting skills have never been better than in her most recent film, "Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith." As for Clark, his recent film Boom Town has been a huge success everywhere, which is clear proof that his reputation has not diminished.</p>
