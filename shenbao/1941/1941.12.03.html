<h3>美國靜待日方覆文　緊張氣氛未見鬆馳　來栖聲稱賡續進行　華府人士注意日延宕政策</h3>
<p>路透社二日華盛頓電　美·日關係刻在嚴重危狀中、苟日本覆文不大變東京之之塲、則此危狀將繼續存在、此為華盛頓消息靈通者之大多數見解、彼等認羅斯福總統之急促返京、乃時局即將有大變化之表示、但在日本覆文未到時、局勢猶在相持中、而極緊張之氣氛依然未鬆動也、</p>
<p>路透社二日華盛頓電　日本覆文尙未到達、時局緊張依然如故、目前華盛頓人士所注意者、為東京傳來權威方面之消息、據謂、日本希望華盛頓談話將繼續至少兩星期、若干觀察家認、此乃日本備戰在兩星期後可望完成之解、此間殊少日本覆文可使討論繼續之希望、蓋日相東條已事前拒絕美國解決太平洋問題的提議所根據之原則也、</p>
<p>路透社一日東京電　今晨各報前幅載有意見相同之社論、皆謂美·日意見雖甚懸殊、但日本仍抱繼續華府談話之鎭定的主張云、許多東京觀察家現信、日本已發出可使時局不愈臻嚴重之覆文、大約此項覆文昨已為內閣臨時會議所通過矣、</p>
<p>路透社二日華盛頓電　國務卿赫爾昨與日使談話後、羅斯福總統即於午時與赫爾及海軍參謀長史達克舉行歷時頗久之會議、</p>
<p>合衆社二日華盛頓電　據日特使來栖稱、彼尙未接獲日政府致美國之覆文、一日之會談、不能認為「最後」之談判、並預料談判將賡續舉行、</p>
<p>合衆社二日華盛頓電　此間披露、國務副卿威爾斯、英大使哈立法克斯昨亦會談約二十分鐘、事後威爾斯即匆促赴白宮、此項發展、為華盛頓對遠東事件之緊張狀態、</p>
<p>來栖野村再晤赫爾　檢討過去談話各點</p>
<p>路透社二日華盛頓電　日大使野村與特使來栖、昨晨到國務卿辦公室與赫爾晤談逾一小時事畢出門、面有憂色、某記者趨前問、美·日立塲仍相距甚違否、野村答稱、「余相信保全時局、必為賢明之政治手腕吾人奉政府命、將再晤赫爾、吾人此次晤談、僅與國務卿重行檢討以前談話之各點耳」、國務院人員稱、日方對赫爾牒文說明美國態度者之覆文、不久當可送來云、總統甫從溫泉歸來、昨除與霍甫金聚餐外、未見其有任何約會、</p>
<p>路透社二日華盛頓電　來栖昨與赫爾晤談後、出國務院時面呈疲憊沉肅之象、而野村雖勉作樂觀語、終不掩其惶遽之形色、觀於東條所發掃蕩東亞英、美勢力之論調、及東鄉斥美國原則為狂妄之議論、衆料刻在期待中之日本覆文、未必能大變東京立塲也、來栖昨施用外交慣技、指東條言論為人誤傳、但東鄉指斥美國原則之議論、則來栖對之默然無言、不能為之辯護、此間人士對於來栖個人確有同情、蓋特使旣奉政府之使命、而又為政府所賣如來栖者固前所罕有也自來栖奉命蒞此以來、幾未有一日不見東京閣員發表足以妨醫其討論之敵意的或傲慢的言論、但赫爾卒表示多大忍耐、不知來栖在過去半個月內已不得不費去其多少寳貴時間、向赫爾解釋所謂東京政府負責人員所發之離奇言論矣、來栖旣不能左右其自己政府、叉無力反對美國堅持不撓之原則、其人縱有誠意、然其地位實屬絕望、今華盛頓雖仍抱戰事或可倖免之希望、但毫無樂觀、據衆所知、日本不戰則己、戰則必敗、然日本現猶掙扎推進其爭點、使之更近戰爭、其地位如何、殊費人猜疑、</p>
<p>日閣昨晨舉行常會　交換美日意見</p>
<p>路透社二日東京電　據日人消息、今晨十時內閣常會在首相官邸舉行、諸閣員曾交換關於日美談判之意見、並通過內國計畫十五件以上、內有在台灣增加米產計畫、</p>
<p>路透社二日東京電情報局發言人岸偉一、今晨招待外籍新聞訪員時曾稱、日美談話雖雙方觀察點頗相歧異、但仍將賡續進行、有問及談話之前途者、發言人答曰、苟無妥協之希望、無人願繼續談判、吾人必須靜待以觀、有問赫爾之文件是否是為談判之梗阻、發言人答稱、朝日新聞所載如大局更見惡化、則美國擬封閉諸日領事館之說、渠毫未知之、復有人問日政府會否計議對付日本之美領事館、發言人答曰、余意未必出此、發言人徵實龍田丸將於今日正午開往洛杉磯與巴爾波、</p>
<p>合衆社二日東京電日報本日同時發表對於華盛頓會議最後結果表不悲觀之評論、各報幾一致以為談判必將失敗、並謂日本應準備應付最惡劣之局勢、並主張採取迅速行動、以應付泰國之局勢、泰國現時已顯然為ABCD集團中之一員云、國民新聞稱、吾人對於芙·美稱覇亞洲之野心必須立即以報復之手段淸除之、</p>
<p>合衆社二日東京電親軸心國之東和會首領中野、今日於日比谷公園民衆大會議中提出意見要求政府於美國果不承認東三原則時、訴諸武力、又要求政府於美國仍然不放棄援助重慶時、採取類似戰爭之行動、如沉毀美國運送船等、中野叉攻擊政府派遺來栖赴美、謂日本與美國為任何妥協之解决、均將致日本於敗滅中、又稱、「吾人不能漠視當前之危機、目下英·美均深知其無力對日挑戰、是以無論如何吾人決不能容許以和平為動機之華盛頓談判為無限期之延續、中野又謂、民主國家係在從事宣傳及恐嚇、以圖完成其反日之包圍圈、又稱「美國並無眞欲與日接近之意、設日本與美妥協、放棄南進換取美國之汽油、則恐簽訂此協定之日、吾人將見荷印越南及泰國之反日火燄均起爆發、而日本與德·義之連繫、亦將斷絕矣」、</p>

<h3>羅斯托夫的克復</h3>
<p>蘇聯南路丁莫森柯部下的大軍，於一個禮拜前，開始了對德軍的攻勢。經過將近一禮拜的惡戰，於上月二十九日完全克復了南路要地罗斯托夫，這個消息，已由蘇方正式公告，而德方亦已予以承認了。</p>
<p>這是自德，蘇戰爭以來蘇軍第一次的重要勝利，當然，這不過僅僅是一個局部的嘗試攻勢，看起來，也許不至立刻就發展爲全面決定性的反攻。不過從意義上說，　至少表明了兩點：第一，蘇軍後備力量雄厚，一直保持著反守望為攻的力量。第二，蘇軍統帥指揮戰略的卓越，　確實有著利用機宜，採取主動的能力。統計德，蘇大戰爆發以來五個多月的戰鬬過程中，這一次羅斯托夫的克復，確是德軍一貫前進和蘇軍始終採取守勢的局勢下，換了另一副面目，而令一般觀察者爲之耳目一新。這一個重要勝利的鼓勵，我們不難想像到，蘇軍的士氣，一定要空前地提高起來。至於歐洲聯軍及世界整個反侵略陣綫方面所受到的鼓勵，及對於最後勝利自信心的加强，那是更不待說的。</p>
<p>這次南路蘇軍的勝利，對於德蘇形勢的實際影響，不用說，也是非常的重大。</p>
<p>第一，牠迎頭堵住了德軍向高加索的突進。德軍在牠第二次攻勢受阻，進行第三次攻勢的時候，牠的左翼，曾經結集了非常雄大的軍力與器械，竭力向烏克蘭衝進，一舉而佔領了若干要地，達到了尼泊河。在第四次攻勢裏，牠的主要目標，雖然在於莫斯科，但南路的進攻，却也一直沒有停頓。結果佔領了蘇聯工業，軍事及交通要地的羅斯托夫，而達到了頓河流域及唐納資盆地。除此而外，牠又發動了對克里米亞島的大戰，在一個多月以內，幾乎已經完全佔領了該島的所有耍地。而蘇軍堵截克里米亞德軍向高加索進攻最大的憑藉，當然，是現在排列在阿索夫海內的海軍力量，及完全在蘇軍控制下的八英里闊的海面。所以，假定德軍由羅斯托夫出發，一面直接向相距六百英里的巴庫油田及高加索一帶推進，同時再沿阿索夫海岸南進的話，那末，不獨高加索因此要成爲戰爭的直接目標；甚至於現在停留在阿索夫海裏的蘇聯海軍，也要受到重大的威脅。所以這次蘇軍反攻裏，一舉而克復了羅斯托夫之外，又曾經在克里米亞舉行了相呼應的反攻，迫使德軍向後敗退。這一來，至少在最近期間內，高加索所受的威脅，是大大的减削了。</p>
<p>比較更重要的，德軍對莫斯科的壓力，也就因爲蘇軍的收複羅斯托夫，而大大地鬆馳。這一回德軍對莫斯科頃力進攻，前後已進行了兩個多月。而尤其這十多天來，德軍受了形勢的逼迫，面對蘇聯荒寒的原野與漫長的冬季，使牠不得不儘其在莫斯科附近所有的力量，再作最後的猛撲。可是，以蘇聯莫斯科守軍的大量結集，及守土決心的堅定，現在德軍攻擊莫斯科的力量，如不大量增加生力軍及器具的話，則無論如何，牠決無擊敗蘇軍的希望·可是，以目前德軍結集的衆多，已經替希特勒造下一個非常嚴重的過冬問題，如果他現在再調集生力部隊，從事第五次攻勢的話，那末，萬一再攻不進莫斯科，則人數增多後如何過冬的問題，就更加嚴重，這是希特勒當前認爲非常苦悶的。這樣形勢下，唐納資盆地一帶戰事的發展，對於莫斯科的得失，也就發生了非常重大的影響。據蘇聯方面宣稱，德軍曾經企圖由喀柯夫及唐納資流域一帶，向頓河流域，舉行大規模的突進，對莫斯科區域展開一個空前未有的巨大鉗形運動，同時企圖將堅守莫斯科的中路蘇軍與守衛南路的蘇軍，完全截爲兩段。如果德軍眞能實現這一企圖，那末對於蘇軍所加的威脅，不用說，是非常之嚴重的。可是現在蘇軍已經完全看出了這一點，所以牠在南路開始了攻勢，消弭了這個潛在的危機，而鬆弛了德軍對莫斯科的威脅。</p>
<p>蘇軍這次南路攻勢所調用力量的大小，直到現在，還沒有看到具體數字的發表。而羅斯托夫的克復，大半還由於牠戰略的卓越。牠先由唐納資河盆地一，一舉而擊潰了羅斯托夫西方的德軍陣綫，使德軍面對着受圍的危險，而不得不趕緊敗退。據蘇軍方面正式宣稱，德軍有四師完全被殲滅，另外四師則潰不成軍，那末，戰爭的劇烈程度，也是可以想見的。戰事仍然在發展之中。德車已經退到一百幾十英里的木立托波爾一帶。至於德軍能不能就此穩住陣錢，或再事反攻，當然要決之於蘇軍這次所用力量的大小及德軍援軍的强弱。這是在今後幾天內，大概就可以分曉的。</p>

<h3>作戰兩年後的德國</h3>
<p>公園中一天到晚，盡是孩子的母親和老年人。幼的玩着球，一個不留神，便跌倒在路旁的</p>
<p>德國會和美國開戰嗎？我在一九四〇年秋間到達柏林時，德國官塲僅說：「美國若加人戰爭，未免愚不可及。」但至一九四一年春末，即有若千官吏以爲不獨南斯拉夫事件和對英戰事內延長，應由美國完全負責，即此次歐戰的負任，亦應由美國負之。他們堅說：德國自一九三三年以來，對於羣集羅斯福身旁的國際猶太人的陰謀暗算，即已開始警戒，而波蘭，法蘭西和南期拉夫，都在美國摧毀德國的瘋狂願望之下，因誤信人言而做了犧牲品。並有人說，英國也不過是美國的猫脚爪而已。</p>
<p>上等皮鞋雖富有者亦很少穿着，中等階級更不消說，此外當然絕跡不見。普通人穿的都是木鞋底，走在路上，吉吉閣閣，儼然是一個雛形的日本，要買眞皮鞋，雖特權階級亦辦不到，就是充皮鞋亦須經過特別許可方能購買。</p>
<p>在咖啡館裏所喝的咖啡不像咖啡，茶亦不像茶：吃的冰稱爲「法朋L．G．Farben（是一家顏料托辣斯），吸的烟叫作「枯草」。</p>
<p>柏林半數以上的婦女皆以工作謀生，可是沿柯費斯登丹和林蔭街有一大羣倩裝艷服的女子，雖有强迫工作的謠傳，却不像願爲工廠服務的樣子。</p>
<p>柏林有不少很好的網球塲，但因缺乏網球，所以應用的很少。溫西高爾夫總會裏已排着高射砲，今年因會員多以軍二。賭賽時的比數並不發表，所以不知道那一匹馬是冷門，那一匹馬爲衆人所屬意。不過熟悉內幕的人都知道，在比賽後十五分鐘發表時，獨贏者所務親身，且在國內，雖出重價也買不到高爾夫球，所以並不十分擁擠。打球的大部份是日本人，坐在陽臺上觀看的大部份是穿着蘇格蘭呢服的上等德國人和外國官員，帶着金髮碧眼的女子。給總會侍者們最好的小賬，不是金錢而是香烟或食物券。</p>
<p>跑馬照常舉行。看客依然人山人海，其從容不迫之狀，竟與世界各地一般無得，實際決不超過本錢　倍，位置甚或不能够本。一部份原因是由於國家捐稅繁重，一部份則因稅重而跑爲塲的回扣太大，可是賭賽的人依然不少。</p>
<p>一到夏天，在柏林的咖啡館，高爾夫球塲和跑馬廳中，固然因氣候和暖而更形熱閙，大多數以勞力謀生的德國人，其生活却並沒有什麽大改變，勞動在德國的夏天並不比冬天鬆懈，其工作時間一樣的長，男子每星期工作六十小時。女子多數為五十六小時。</p>
<p>肥皂按月的分配量，祇可供每天洗一回手和每星期洗一次澡，常在第三星期杪早已用完了。溫水是奢侈品，城市中公寓裏亦祇有星期五日晚和星期六日有得供給。主婦們要添購鍋鑊，磁器，咖啡罐，非常困難。各種家用器皿，實際在店鋪中已是看不見了。人民即使有錢，也買不到照相機，望遠鏡，手錶，打字機，無綫電和金銀器具。</p>
<p>德國夏日盡長，要到十時方纔天黑，多數德國人的消遣方法，不是在公園散步，即是啤酒一杯，彼此閒談。他們也成羣結隊的去看雷影，可是十一二歲有智識的小孩，見了這種影片也覺得不快。歌劇和話劇雖好，祇是代價太貴了。</p>
<p>五月一日在德幽稱爲民族勞動節。那位勞工陣綫騙子萊氏演說道：我們的工作這樣艱巨，我們的成績這樣偉大，我</p>
<p>六月初某日，我在柏林市公園裏看見三個衣服齊整的孩子，同在玩。兩個四五歲的男孩子，把他們的三輪腳踏車翻了轉來，坐在兩個後輪中間用手把着前輪。他們算是飛機駕駛員。一個年約六歲的女孩子，在三輪腳踏車附近的地面上晝一大方框。她吿訴他們，「這是下面的飛機塲。」她又在角上畫一小方框說，「這是飛機庫。那個較大的男孩子爬下車來，在方框內劃上許多十字說，「這是飛機。他和另一個男孩裝滿了幾袋石子，坐上飛機，把石子向飛機塲投下，當石子落地時高呼着　！轟！飛機塲炸毀了，他們便開始一塲惡戰。（未完）</p>

<h3>倫敦中國公債大漲　內債已起回風尙覺無力</h3>
<p>倫敦一日（週一）電、今日中國外債及遠東英美商各公司股票掛牌行市、中國公債又見上升、前檔之克利斯浦及善後（英發）各升五鎊、前者為三十七鎊、後為四十三鎊半、中法美金及英法（英發）各升四鎊、前者為五十一鎊、後者為五十二鎊、英德續（英發）升三鎊、為五十三鎊、英克斯升一鎊、為十五鎊、後檔鐵路債券、道淸津浦原續發及廣九各升三鎊、道淸為二十鎊、津浦廣九各為十八鎊、湖廣非德發升一鎊、價為十九鎊、餘者各升二鎊、計北甯為七十二鎊、湖廣德發以及隴海均為十七鎊、京滬為一十鎊、至英商股票、祇匯豐銀行股獨呈下游、計英倫註册股跌二鎊半、為七十五鎊牛、香港註册股跌二鎊、為八十三鎊、有行無市、餘無變動、</p>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市雖略起回風、但仍覺無力、且向來回漲時、交易必見旺盛、而昨日交易、反而大為减退、可見人心仍以美日談判、而猶未能鞏固昨日上午開盤、潤德及仁豐買進、但亦拉抬無力、丙種自晨至暮、未能達到八元、戊種雖逼近抽籤、亦祇做好五分、因聯益裕興鴻大頗有脫手、故多方仍覺抬頭不起、午後同康·公茂買進、聯益則繼續賣出、怡泰又有出脫、行市仍覺平平、而交易則大為减退、結果除丁種因兩日來開出尙小五角外、餘均好起自五分至八角不等、成交約一百三十萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後，</p>
<p>股票交易成交交通銀行股一百股、價為一百三十元正、</p>
<p>衆業公所股市、開盤價格回堅、開後空方略有抵補、終因所漲已鉅、局勢又無確切進展、經營者大都觀望、故當日全屬盤旋、無大上落、</p>
<h3>紗布失去重心　高出低進隨市浮沉</h3>
<p>紗市先漲後跌、但局勢依然飄盪不定、實則價高有人出、反之有人進、所以目前狀况、尙在迴旋之中、大戶逢低必買、一般散戶視現紗無交易、意態傾向拋賣也、二十支雙馬最高價為二千五百五十元、低價為二千四百三十五元、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、承上日堅昂之氣續進、首盤價為二千五百十五元、此時浮空扒補、頗不乏人、少頃升至二千五百五十元、嗣後取引所二盤價跌、人心較弱、賣者益夥、跌至二千四百八十元、但價格一低、盈利人扒空復起、又昂至二千五百六十五元、惟大戶之多額、在暗中紛紛出範、以致籌碼鬆懈、在將近收盤時、步步而下、至二千四百七十元收盤、查上午半日間成交統計二千八百五十包、午後情况平淡乏勁、開盤價為二千四百六十元、微升至二千四百七十五元、旋聞取引所價鬆、回疲至二千四百三十五元收盤</p>
<p>金雙馬期貨市况、兔起鶻落、突又重入疲途、蓋以美日間之談判、未見若何顯著展開、而環象叉未能繼以良好消息、故一般人心仍無特殊進步、加以銀根奇緊、使多方之潛力大為减弱、雖市氣每經一良好之刺激、其上升頗速、但尙不若下瀉之為甚、可見紗市之脚地上、還未臻鞏固之象、當晨初開出、先以金市與現紗之續升、期紗人心煥發、相爭扒進、尤以散空之抵補、一時買氣極旺、故十二月份為二五七○元高價開出、續升七十元、一月份二六一五元做開、亦好五十六元之多、迨二月份開盤、適以廠單轉軟、已有隨之下傾之勢、入後繼續不振、至午後已各小達三五十元、午後雖以廠單與取引所極度盤旋、雖仍帶軟、而期紗尙定、中途雖見全日低價、而收盤潔稱堅穩、全日七落結果、各月期均小四十元，茲列表於後、</p>
<p>十二月　一月　二月</p>
<p>現棉情况平庸、但市上大衆觀望、待機而動生氣也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市不定而有參次、先因遠東局勢險象叢生而跌、同時又因經紀商買進、及空頭抵補略漲、結果收盤價格、較上日張跌二三磅背不等、</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因棉商再套買而跌、後因投機者買進、及股票市塲堅昂而回昇、昨日收盤價格、各漲一羅比左右、又預測今日開盤市况、因政治消息甚為惡劣、而看跌一羅比半、</p>
<h3>米蠹蠢然思動　棧粉苦樂不勻</h3>
<p>工部局洋米、昨日下午太古公司北海輪抵埠、由香港裝來洋米一萬零二百包、停靠法租界外灘本行四號碼頭起卸、上海一部分米商、尤其是發米號家、及大宗囤戶、均在作最後之掙扎、希冀恢復米市塲、其理由當然以其少數人之生活關係、實際上則欲摧毀工部局之統制、蓋市塲旣可公開、價格即可高低上下、工部局之限價、又將形同虛設、此其手段之陰險巧妙、想工部局決不為所欺朦、致有中道而廢、為德不終之誚、故昨日國米亦無做開、即為米商對公家消極抵抗之無言示威行動、</p>
<p>昨洋粉市况、略見活潑、因本街實銷戶久未暢辦、需胃逐次加濃、而客幫與囤戶納胃亦佳、惟執貨者售意仍鬆、一般浮多散戶鑒於市存充實、港粉將到、時局緊弛不一、存粉夜長夢多、乃多隨市求脫、所以供求相敵、市面仍居平局、東棧金龍五十一二元、東棧澳粉鐘樓牌五十四元半西棧進口登記粉金龍牌四十元及卅九元半、砲囊四十一元至四十元、均與前市相似、惟小麥麩皮均以缺貨見俏云、</p>
<h3>銀行帮出籠　金市漲勢又衰</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗市、始漲繼跌、一萬五千元大關數次衝出後、匯即回入、各方人心恍忽、乃美日談判已臨最後關頭、前途變化仍難逆料、成記及銀樓幫納胃雖佳、而銀行幫輿現金號之競相出範、價一見一萬五千四百元旋即盤下、退至一萬四千三百元、終見軋小三百七十元、全日交易共二萬三千兩左右、</p>
<p>現金價先漲終回</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、承上日漲勢、突出一萬五千元大關外、九點開市一萬五千一百元、計開高三百兀、達一萬九千四百元、祥和·順源·同康永現金號不斷售出、天元及證券幫亦賣出、立見回瀉六百元、退至一萬四千八百元、成記·德成、明豐收吸、提升至一萬五千元左右甚久、一度升至一萬五千二百元、午刻祥和·順源·公和·祥興永·合盛再售不止、午刻更步降難回、退至一萬四千四百八十元、午收一萬四千五百三十元、下午二點開市甚堅、抬高二百七十元、為一萬四千八百元、祥和·永成·證券號·萬豐·天兀先後力售、價遂步瀉五百元、跌至一萬四千三百元低價、祥和·明豐·成記力進、始稍提上、收市一萬四千四百三十元、比上日收價回小三百七十元、有一千一百元差度、現金號之本牌金、門市售價一萬四千六百元、收進比售出低一千元左右、</p>
<p>飾金掛小五十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出價、同行晨初即掛升五十元、為一千五百七十元、後忽掛小三次、低一百元、終為一千四百七十元、（收進减一白五十元）軋小五卜元、紋銀仍掛二十二元、黑市十七元、有五六百兩交易云、</p>
<h3>華商黑滙多頭　非貴價不肯供給　英金票忽告劇落</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、中央與滙豐兩掛牌如前、滙豐等小櫃檯價亦平、英美滙黑黑市續趨軟化、進口洋行雖少扒結、但因前日現金之飛漲、而賣戶已絕跡、華商多頭之賣價已喊軟至英滙二辦士三七五、美金三元半、始肯供給、全日始終未成交、價比前日英緊○六二五、美緊一二五、</p>
<p>昨日外幣市况、英美金鎊下墮、現金價各跌十元、英金票忽告劇落、晚市退為六十元、美金票於上午會高至二十九元、最後價為二十八元五角、比上日軋升二角、香港票趨勢亦軟，晚市退為六元四角，日金票及軍用票亦趨低落、前者退為二元八角、後者降至三元四角六分、</p>
<p>香港二日（週二）電、今晨滙市開盤平穩異常、各滙仍無榮辱、</p>
<p>天津二日（週二）電、今晨滙市開盤告平、倫敦及紐約電滙均無變動、有行無市、申滙亦站原盤、聯鈔暗盤回賤二角五分？為四十九元二角五分、</p>
<h3>棉布起伏漸狹</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市晨初一度七漲、繼即叵跌，蓋實銷呆滯，廠方及同業乘高賣出、怡和振中廠各檔租布均有近期額子開售、致布價欲漲無力、午後起伏更微、結果較上日漲跌參差二角半與五角之譜、本街成交粗布絨布等二百餘件、浙東幫辦粗布色布五六十件、</p>
<p>東布　先漲後跌、升降範圍漸狹、故市勢轉入平穩、取引所彩球細布期貨開盤漲五角、後以紗價下游、跟踪而挫、本月份收盤為八十五元、較跌一元半、一月份八十八元、二月份八十九元五角、俱跌一元、龍頭細布廠單晚收九十元、則跌二元外、四君子嗶嘰收市價三元三角、亦跌七分、</p>
<h3>糖市復趨下游</h3>
<p>跌度自十二元至四元不一　昨糖市因日美局勢似較和緩、致人心虛怯、前市漲風幾如曇花一現、而交易靜寂、本日成交總數期貨為六千餘包、現貨僅五千餘包、如二四粗白公司期貨、本月份七午開二百零六元至零二元、下午竟跌入二百關、為一百九十七元至九十九元、比前市跌八元半、又二十期者上午二百十二元至十一元、下午二百零六元半、回高至九元、結果小落九元、現貨十一月進口上午二百十四元至零八元半</p>
<h3>油豆參差不一</h3>
<p>昨日雜糧市况參差不一、食油因存底减少、貨主扳俏、而見挺升十元內外、黃豆本客去胃蟬聯、續昂二三元、苞米先受客幫動辦趨堅、嗣以獲利囤戶傾吐轉降、結果比前軋小一二元、統市售開靑島生油廿桶、江北生油三百聽、大連豆油一百餘桶、大有廠淸油八百擔、日華廠菜油二百多桶、天津新金元四百包、又靑豆二百包、苞米現貨二千多包、又英華司七百噸、</p>

<h3>房屋糾紛的處理問題</h3>
<p>— 平野</p>
<p>租界當局對於平準日用品價格的努力，有其成就與功續，我們回時也確信他對於市民居住的問題，當然也在考量之列昨報載租界當局對房租問題，曾予研究，惟因處置辦法，涉及法律，故進行情感困難。但是我們相信這不是對於狂抬房價無法制止之謂。法律不外乎人情，逾越人情的抬價。威脅市民居住的安全，亦即影響公安，所以我們的意見，是寬其旣往，嚴於未來，只要能够衡情酌埋訂定辦法，至少可以使狂漲中的房租價格，得到平準。</p>
<p>我們以為要解決這個大多數平民所深受的房尾加租壓力，治標的辦法有下列數點，（一）在辦法公布以所，二房東三房客所訂定之租賃契約一律照舊，此後二房東如需增加租金必須將增加理山（如目來水房捐增加原因）向租界當局主管部分報告，經過番核，認為實情，始得酌增，其租賃契約期滿，如繼續租賃而　房東要求增租者亦同，不得暗中與第三者接洽另易房客，至二房東目稱收回自用者，亦應將理由報告，聽候審核，其租賃契約未滿，除契約上別有規定外，不得宣稱自用，向房客要求遷移。（二）分宅出售問題，房主縱有更動，不能變更原住房客，亦不得增加租金，換售之可以變更租契所載房主戶名　不能變更原約規定字句。（三）嗣後　房東出租房屋，不得收取小租或他類似名目之任何費用，租戶自願繳納少數修理費者聽，但每間不得超過右干元。（四）房客於契約期滿前一個月請求繼續承租者，得照原租金繼續租賃，（五）出租人遠背各種規定時，處予罰金，勒索小費，通令遷移者，從嚴處分。</p>
<p>我們接到各界為房租呼籲的信件，幾如山積，同時也有人投函主張折衷辦法，勿使二房東坐令屋空而不召租，或轉輾出租親友，使舉目無親者幾無下榻之所，其實只要對於勒索小費或逼令遷移有一個公平辦法，自不致使房屋問題，荊棘叢生，我們確信以安定日用品價格工作之艱巨，租界當局已能樹其良好的風尙，這個看似繁複，而實則比較日用品問題為簡單的房屋問題，租界當局必能於相當時間，獲得事功的成就，這是我們可以斷言的。</p>
<h3>屋與住·搬塲與加租</h3>
<p>— 方揚</p>
<p>二房東的兒子，說是下月中要結婚了。房東太太來商量，說是「早一個月回你們的房子，好讓你們去找！」話是說得再漂亮沒有。可是，四十五塊錢一個月一間朝南的統樓，一到那兒去找呢？</p>
<p>共實，我每月所付的房錢　，巳經支持了二房東整幢房子的開支。他們白住了整個下層不算，而且還賺了三層樓三十六塊和亭子間的二十二塊。可是，他們還要在我道個「老房客」頭七打起算盤來了——兒子的結婚是假的，要我搬家却是眞話。</p>
<p>而且，聽說老房客走了，一新進來的，還可收上一筆一兩千塊錢的小租或是押租。</p>
<p>結果，托人來說，給我三個月「搬塲費」。可是，我們這樣決定了：</p>
<p>「大家出去找房子，只要條件（包括房租，出路等）適合，請二房東替我們搬到新地方去就完了。至於我自己，決不要拿一個銅板。」</p>
<p>這裏，就開始了我的「找屋子」的生活。——每天看房東太太那張死氣沉沉的臉孔，實在太沒有味道。決心向外去看看外面的「屋子市塲」究竟怎麼樣了？</p>
<p>地方總算跑了不少，但在這樣的條件不給回絕了——</p>
<p>「你們有幾個人？有小孩子的不借！」我告訴他有三個，他們連頭都快搖掉了。嘴裹接連的「不借不借！」</p>
<p>這，眞使我莫明其妙起來？國家不是在「獎勵生育」嗎？中國不是以人口衆多而誇耀於世界嗎？但是，上海的二房東們却為什麼要反對人家「生孩子」呢？還是怕別人定有了孩子，會搶去他們的「產業」，而盼望人家「絕子絕孫」嗎？</p>
<p>這是一種，但又有許多則在幾千小租，幾個月押租，先付五年租金等等條件下，把我嚇了回來。</p>
<p>於是，我就只好老躭在那幢房子裏受二房東的氣，而且、終天的在「借女兒罵媳婦」的日子下挨過着，已經有二個牛月了，新房子，還是沒有着落！（他們兒子的「結婚」就只好展期。）</p>
<p>這些，我都不懂，七海的物價可以統制，為什麼上海的房子，到今天還讓二房東們的氣勢囂張得如此呢？</p>
<h3>高論集</h3>
<p>— 大學生輯</p>
<p>上海有些大學敎援在讀講義之餘，照例還愛發幾句高論，而且是宇宙之大，蒼蠅之微，無所不包。今姑記數則如下，以饗春秋讀者。</p>
<p>飛躍說</p>
<p>據某敎授說，幸虧中國鐵路公路交通不發達，因為今日最便利之交通工具為飛機；鐵路公路均已落伍。美國鐵路公路蹤橫全國，殆將無用矣。而吾中國則可跳過鐵路公路階段，進而利用飛機。其實我們還可再等上千八百年。蓋人類不滅，進步不止，將來必有比飛機更利便之交通工具，我們多等幾百年，或甚至幾千年不是可跳得更遠些嗎？質諸某敎援不知何故？</p>
<p>深刻的敎訓</p>
<p>旣是敎授，必然鍍金；旣會鍍金，必有「當我在美國的時候。」而我們的大敎授在美一國的時候，所得到的最深刻的敎訓是下面一件事。</p>
<p>原來當我們的大敎授臨到返國之際，他的洋師傳曾贈他名言一句：「你回去甚麼都可以帶去，千萬不要把美國的磯器帶去；美國就吃了機器的虧，你們東方的精神文明是偉大的。一這位洋師傳如果得知他的門生如何努力地在傳播他的名言，必欣然日「孺子可敎矣。阿Q如遭槍斃，亦可含笑九泉；如又復活，必曰「吾道不孤」。</p>
<h3>重振工商道德</h3>
<p>— 競存</p>
<p>戰事發生以前，上海工商界對於從業員的修養與訓練，曾經努力倡導過；那時我知道有許多公司商號自辦訓練班，或資助店員職工人補習學校。自戰事發生，工商業首受打擊，進種訓練職工的工作也就停頓了。戰事內移，上海人口集中，各業又呈蓬勃的氣象。營業雖然旺盛，而工商從業員的服務道德，似乎反不及戰前能令人滿意了。這實是工商界所必須注意的一件事。最近我有機會參觀了鶴嗚鞋帽商店，並與其主持人作了幾度深切的談話，我覺得他的店員的訓練，實有令人可敬之處。</p>
<p>上海一般的鞋帽店，其店員大都出身於學徒，鶴嗚則招用中等學校學生再施以職業訓練，故其應接顧客，溫文有禮，和藹可親，在在予人以良好的印象。每日工作完畢以後，由其經理領導從事種種業餘活動，如星期一之知識演講，星期三之家庭禮拜，星期五之球類比賽，平時更時請名人演講，以貫輸靑年所必需之學識。且聞不久將成立一商界靑年會，對於店員的德知體羣四育更予以充分的訓練。該號任何業餘組織或活動，均全體一致參加，無經理店員之別，故其平時上下和翕，善相勸，過相規，在我所熟識的工商行號中，鶴鳴是我認為最有前途的一個。</p>
<p>上海戰後的工商道德，實有重振的必要，尤其是今日，工商界捨「賺錢」外談不到服務，例如物價的一漲再漲，並不能說事實上有漲的必要，大家一窩風的漲價，但我所知道鶴鳴的貨價獨漲在人後，如果大家如此，物價總不會如天馬行空一日千里的漲上去。</p>

<p>錢若默足足躊躇了四五分鐘才回答。</p>
<p>「這是很難說的·」他吐出了一口潑烟，側着頭，望陰霾範罩的天空看了一看「在大亮以前，大家祇能忍痛吃一些苦了！」</p>
<p>上海迢幾天的情形，梅寳原也有些明白，但究竟嚴重到怎樣地步，却直釗此刻見了錢若默的顏色才知道。</p>
<p>不幸得很，這種情形竟一天比一天嚴重了，及至秋海棠病愈起床，上海巳成了另外一個世界。錢若默是走了，臨動身前，給他們送來了五十塊錢，和一張短短的宇條，說明自已因職務關係，離滬入川，希望梅寳父女倆也能慢慢地設法上西南去。</p>
<p>張銀財也來過幾次，還告訴秋海棠說，他巳轉入新開的榮舞台充武管事，祇要秋海棠的嗓子够得上，他可以替他幫忙弄一個裹子老生幹幹。</p>
<p>但這一次，梅寳却不願再放他父親出去賣老骨頭了。（二七八）</p>

<h3>葛麗亞嘉蓀　演慈母心腸的原因</h3>
<p>— 益凡</p>
<p>現在大華戲孫開映的「慈母心腸」，其女主角葛麗亞嘉蓀還是第一次出現於五彩片中。在「慈母心腸」中，她是塔克薩斯慈幼所的監督，表現出她的慈幼心腸來。米高梅攝製此片前，對選擇主為一事很費去些時日的，結果找到　蓀小姐是好萊塢影星中惟一適合者。</p>
<p>這金髮碧眼的愛爾蘭女郎很知道扮演這個角色不是容易事，但她決意担任，為世界兒童的幸福努力。至於她所以被選而適合一慈母心腸一的中角，也有其道理在呢。</p>
<p>葛麗亞嘉蓀跟一般愛爾蘭人一樣的自小入學。但她從小學起到倫敦大學畢業止，這三個階段中都是靠着獎學金升學的。當然，她畢業後做了敎師，盡敎養之責。不久她被倫敦的一家廣告公司介紹入研究院。後來復被介紹到伯明罕的一家樂曲院去。初演的一部戲，是蕭翁名著，從此她決意獻身游藝而七鏡頭。其成名作是一金箭」一片。</p>
<p>演「古樂」一片後，她被介紹到好萊垢去發展。在美演的第一片是「萬世師表」，曾得敎育界獎譽。她會與羅勁泰勒合演Remember。也是一屏開雀選」主角。現在她出現於五彩片「慈母心腸」中，做着二千個幼孩的愛人。以她幼時所受的薰陶和學成後敎養的經騐，其成功也可想見。上海人看了，多少可有點「慈幼心腸」吧</p>
<h3>新角登臺第一天</h3>
<p>— 之瑜</p>
<p>李少春，從北平鍍了金回來，在天蟾登豪了。第一天打泡是「打鼓罵曹」和「兩將軍」，一文一武，戲是多麼地嶄呀！我趕到時，臺上李佩芳正唱六月雪，接着是班世超的蟠桃會，大打出手，和閻世善比較起來，也還不弱，下巴白元傑，看模樣十來歲的小伙子，玩意兒眞不差呢！因為是第一天打袍，所以特別賣力。張海臣的取洛陽小平而過，下來，就是白玉薇的春秋配了。白玉薇一出塲，就楚一個滿堂，她的扮相，眞和她的名字一樣美，她的表情相當逼眞，大槪因為以小娘兒演小娘兒的緣故吧。可惜的是那嗓子不亮，所以許多好腔，祗有前排觀衆可以享到耳福。</p>
<p>李少春的「罵曹」登臺了，上來一句引子，余味十足，一聲滿堂，「平生志氣……」一段唱來句句過癮。那打鼓之聲，以「大珠小珠落玉盤」之句來形容它，決不會過分，再加上那支淸健的「夜深沉」，呀！太美了，幾句二六也很規矩，不過他的嗓子比楊寳森差一些，而臉上比寳森有戲多了。「兩將軍」，我認為是最有勁的齣，李少春是武生出身，在「奇俠大紅袍」裏，巳經「狠」出名了。所以他的武功眞不壞，那條腿獨立了三分鐘不算數，再來上三個翻身。他唱又唱得出——我看過的「兩將軍」，那位馬將軍總是「沙壳子」唱的，之瑜雖然拚命直叫還叫不出。——不愧「文武全才」。毛慶來眞是硬下手，無怪李氏郎舅倆都要搶他。</p>
<p>最後，應該一提的，是李寳奎的劉備，你不要看輕他是個裏子，他的唱做，比「非驢非馬」的正角兒要高明得多多，城上觀戰一塲的一時「驚」，一時「喜」，一時「急」，一時「怨」的表情，眞把當時候的劉備給活活地表演了出來，看得眞使我够味呢！</p>

<h3>血雨瓊葩</h3>
<p>— 頋明道</p>
<p>第十九章　黃錯胡騎塵滿城</p>
<p>柳隱英上身也穿的一件白色內衣，露出兩條雪白的臂膊，伸手去解開自己腿上的紥縛，捲起單褲，露出玉藕也似的大腿。史見那傷處有一個小洞，沒有結好，尙有些微的血流出來，旁邊還有一些已凝結的血痕。許靖遂用棉花　了溫熱的淸水，代柳隱英細細揩揩去血污，拭乾了，然後又去取了藥粉，糝敷在傷口，將這傷口盡敷住，取一張小小油紙，把來一裏，然後在油紙外邊撫摩一回，意思是要使油紙平伏一些。不料一手觸到柳隱英的大腿肉時，柳隱英忍不住有些癢，格勒地笑了一聲，把自己的大腿一縮，設道：「謝謝你，待我自己來紥縛好了」。許靖遂縮回雙手，立在炕前，看柳隱英放下褲脚管，徐徐紥縛。剛纔縛好，可是因為柳隱央上身太向前俯倒的關係，身上遮住的半條棉被角忽然望下鬆落。柳隱英起初自己還不覺得，後來抬起頭來，見許靖一雙目光正對他注視不釋，方覺自己的那件小衣胸前有一個鈕扣沒有扣住，正鬆開着，露出雪白的頸項和胸口的一角，不由臉上一紅，忙將棉被拉起，一蒙身子，睡了下去。許靖見了他道個形景，不由起了一重疑雲。暗想柳隱英身上皮肉生得如此白嫩光潤，好似冰肌玉膚，和女孩兒家勞髴。見了我又是這樣時時含羞答答的，豈非可笑？若不是女兒身，他為什麼要如此模樣呢？（二三四）</p>

<h3>The United States Quietly Awaits Japan's Reply, Tensions Show No Sign of Easing, Kurusu Claims Continued Progress, Washington Figures Note Japan's Delaying Tactics</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 2nd - U.S.-Japan relations are currently in a serious crisis. Unless Japan's reply significantly changes the situation in Tokyo, this crisis will continue. This is the prevailing view among well-informed sources in Washington. They believe that President Roosevelt's hasty return to the capital indicates that major changes are imminent. However, until Japan's reply arrives, the situation remains deadlocked, and the atmosphere of extreme tension remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 2nd - Japan's reply has not yet arrived, and the tension remains unchanged. Currently, what Washington figures are paying attention to is the news from authoritative sources in Tokyo, which states that Japan hopes the Washington talks will continue for at least two more weeks. Some observers believe that this means Japan's preparations for war are expected to be completed in two weeks. There is little hope here that Japan's reply will allow the discussions to continue, as Japanese Prime Minister Tojo has already rejected the principles on which the U.S. proposal for resolving the Pacific issue is based.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 1st - This morning, the leading newspapers carried editorials with the same opinion, stating that although U.S.-Japan views are very different, Japan still holds a calm position of continuing the Washington talks. Many Tokyo observers now believe that Japan has issued a reply that will prevent the situation from worsening. It is likely that this reply was passed by an emergency cabinet meeting yesterday.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 2nd - After Secretary of State Hull spoke with the Japanese ambassador yesterday, President Roosevelt held a lengthy meeting with Hull and Chief of Naval Operations Stark at noon.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 2nd - According to Special Envoy Kurusu, he has not yet received the Japanese government's reply to the United States. The talks on the 1st cannot be considered the "final" negotiations, and he anticipates that the negotiations will continue.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 2nd - It is revealed here that Under Secretary of State Welles and British Ambassador Halifax also met for about twenty minutes yesterday. Afterwards, Welles hurriedly went to the White House. This development reflects the state of tension in Washington regarding the Far East situation.</p>
<p>Kurusu and Nomura Meet with Hull Again to Review Past Discussions</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 2nd - Japanese Ambassador Nomura and Special Envoy Kurusu went to the Secretary of State's office yesterday morning and met with Hull for over an hour. They looked worried as they left. A reporter stepped forward and asked if the U.S.-Japan positions were still far apart. Nomura replied, "I believe that preserving the situation must be a wise political move. We are under the government's orders and will meet with Hull again. This time, we are only reviewing the points of previous talks with the Secretary of State." State Department officials said that Japan's reply to Hull's statement explaining the U.S. position should be sent soon. The President just returned from Warm Springs and, apart from dining with Hopkins, did not have any appointments.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 2nd - After meeting with Hull yesterday, Kurusu looked tired and solemn as he left the State Department, while Nomura, although trying to appear optimistic, could not hide his anxiety. Considering Tojo's statements about sweeping away British and American influence in East Asia, and Togo's criticism of American principles as absurd, it is widely expected that the Japanese reply currently being awaited will not significantly change Tokyo's position. Kurusu used diplomatic tactics yesterday, suggesting that Tojo's remarks were misinterpreted, but he remained silent and unable to defend Togo's criticism of American principles. People here have sympathy for Kurusu personally, as it is rare for an envoy to be both tasked by the government and betrayed by it. Since Kurusu was ordered to come here, hardly a day has passed without Tokyo cabinet members making hostile or arrogant remarks sufficient to hinder his discussions. However, Hull has shown great patience. It is unknown how much valuable time Kurusu has had to spend in the past half month explaining the bizarre remarks made by so-called responsible officials in the Tokyo government to Hull. Kurusu cannot control his own government, nor can he oppose the unyielding principles of the United States. Even if he is sincere, his position is hopeless. Although Washington still hopes that war can be avoided, there is no optimism. As everyone knows, Japan will lose if it fights, but Japan is still struggling to push its point closer to war. Its position is dubious.</p>
<p>Japanese Cabinet Holds Regular Meeting Yesterday Morning to Exchange U.S.-Japan Views</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd - According to Japanese sources, a regular cabinet meeting was held at the Prime Minister's residence at 10:00 this morning. Cabinet members exchanged views on the U.S.-Japan talks and passed more than fifteen domestic plans, including a plan to increase rice production in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd - Information Bureau spokesman Kiichi Anami said this morning to foreign news reporters that although the U.S.-Japan talks have quite different viewpoints on both sides, they will continue. When asked about the future of the talks, the spokesman replied, "If there is no hope of compromise, no one would want to continue negotiations. We must wait and see." When asked if Hull's document was an obstacle to the negotiations, the spokesman replied that he was unaware of the Asahi Shimbun's report that the United States intends to close its Japanese consulates if the overall situation worsens. Someone asked if the Japanese government would consider dealing with American consulates in Japan. The spokesman replied, "I don't think so." The spokesman confirmed that the Tatsuta Maru will depart for Los Angeles and Balboa at noon today.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 2nd - Japanese newspapers today simultaneously published comments expressing pessimism about the final outcome of the Washington Conference. Almost all newspapers believe that the negotiations will fail and say that Japan should prepare to cope with the worst situation. They also advocate taking swift action to deal with the situation in Thailand, which is now clearly a member of the ABCD group. The Kokumin Shimbun said, "We must immediately eliminate the U.S.'s ambition to dominate Asia with retaliatory measures."</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 2nd - Nakano, the leader of the pro-Axis Towa Association, proposed at a mass meeting in Hibiya Park today that the government resort to force if the United States does not recognize the three principles of East Asia. He also demanded that the government take war-like actions, such as sinking American transport ships, if the United States continues to provide aid to Chongqing. Nakano also attacked the government's dispatch of Kurusu to the United States, saying that any compromise between Japan and the United States would lead to Japan's ruin. He also said, "We cannot ignore the current crisis. At present, Britain and the United States are well aware that they are unable to challenge Japan, so we must not allow the Washington talks, motivated by peace, to continue indefinitely." Nakano also said that democratic countries are engaged in propaganda and intimidation in an attempt to complete their anti-Japanese encirclement. He also said, "The United States has no real intention of approaching Japan. If Japan compromises with the United States and gives up southward advance in exchange for American gasoline, then I fear that on the day this agreement is signed, we will see anti-Japanese flames erupt in the Dutch East Indies, Vietnam, and Thailand, and Japan's ties with Germany and Italy will be severed."</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attack Wuchuan, One Shot Down by China, Another Damaged and Forced to Land</h3>

<h3>British and Indian Armies Reinforce Burma, Eastern Fleet Arrives in Singapore, Including HMS "Prince of Wales," Hong Kong Garrison Massively Deploys Defenses</h3>
<p>Reuters, Rangoon, 2nd - Army Headquarters announced that a large number of British and Indian reinforcements have continued to arrive in Rangoon. These troops are well-trained and include several units that can be called the largest batch to have arrived in Burma in the past. They are well-equipped and have the latest equipment, including various vehicles and livestock for transportation, and are ready to go to war upon receiving orders.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rangoon, 2nd - Yesterday, the largest collection of modern military vehicle transportation that Burma has ever seen assembled in Rangoon and left here to be transferred to various defense centers throughout the territory to jointly undertake defense with the original garrison. All the tanks are newly built and are the latest models used by the British army.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, Urgent Dispatch, 2nd - A portion of the British fleet, including several heavy warships, sailed into this port this afternoon. Several warships of the newly established Eastern Fleet have arrived. Among the giant ships is the battleship Prince of Wales. The new commander-in-chief of the Eastern Fleet, Sir Phillips, has hoisted his flag on the Prince of Wales. Other warships of the fleet are also arriving one after another.</p>
<p>United Press, Hong Kong, 2nd - Military authorities announced yesterday that a portion of the Hong Kong garrison is standing at its combat posts. The government issued a special notice urging unnecessary residents to evacuate the area. Military authorities said that a part of the garrison is currently carrying out a "large-scale" deployment on the island. About 1,500 Chinese here have been collecting certificates for typhoid and malaria vaccinations to prepare for evacuation. About 100 Japanese residents left here earlier for Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>Thailand Actively Prepares for War</h3>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 2nd - The situation here is completely dominated by the future climax of the Far East crisis. Thailand is quietly advancing all self-defense preparations in anticipation of the worst-case scenario. Although those in charge refused to release details, they insisted that the scope of preparations is broad, including all aspects of national defense. It is now believed that the Thai Navy has entered a state of preparation and is patrolling within territorial waters. Military fortresses in Bangkok and their entrances have been garrisoned. Air defense teams are being rushed to various places. According to reliable sources, the authorities are currently collecting all information on private cars and trucks to requisition them in case of emergency. At the same time, there is also news that plans to evacuate women and children from Bangkok are being considered. Domestic defense volunteer teams are registering in various places, but on the other hand, preparations for the "Miss Thailand" pageant, which is the second week of December, are still in full swing and are not affected by the situation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 2nd - Last night, Thai radio announced that the relevant authorities had checked various parts of the Thai border and had not seen any Japanese troops gathered, and that there was no sign of any invasion of Thailand from any direction. The public should believe these words. No one knows our affairs better than we do ourselves.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 2nd - When asked by the Japanese Embassy spokesman about reports that the Japanese army will invade Thailand from Vietnam, he replied, "I have not received accurate information, so I cannot comment on this matter. However, the Japanese army has never crossed the Thai border, and I believe it will not do so. This is a fact."</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 2nd - The precautionary plan is being implemented step by step. The formal expression of Japan's threatening attitude has not eased at all, so the preparations of the ABCD countries to cope with the breakdown of peace are being implemented in order. The plan should not be changed until Japan issues a more reliable guarantee of its peaceful intentions. People here also take a cold view of the rumors from Manila and the United States that a Japanese fleet was discovered outside the Japanese-administered islands near Borneo. Those in charge, who have very close ties with the United States, pointed out that this news was transmitted by irresponsible parties in the United States and has not been confirmed by the information obtained here. London also believes that this statement should not be taken lightly. All the manpower in Malaya has now been controlled, and Singaporean volunteers have begun to report for service yesterday.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 2nd - British Cabinet's Far East representative Duff Cooper said yesterday that Australia, New Zealand, and Britain and the United States are also willing to avoid war with Japan, but like Britain and the United States, they are not prepared to sacrifice their principles or friends in order to seek temporary peace. He was deeply impressed by the observations he made about Australia and New Zealand. The spirit of the people and their dedication to the war effort are great. Regarding his report on the adjustment of British administration in the Far East, both governments agree with his recommendations. He has included other opinions in the telegram and is now awaiting instructions from London.</p>
<p>Reuters, Canberra, 2nd - Australian Prime Minister Curtin said yesterday that war will only occur in the Pacific if the Japanese side takes the offensive. The British Empire has taken steps over the past two years to ensure that it has the physical resources in the area to defend the Empire's territory, so all actions taken are aimed at resisting aggression.

<h3>Australian 10,000-Ton Cruiser "Sydney" Sinks in Battle After Sinking German Raider, All 600 Crew Members Missing</h3>
<p>Reuters, Sydney, 2nd - According to a statement issued by the Australian government today, the Australian Navy's 10,000-ton cruiser Sydney sank in battle after destroying the German armed raider Steiermark. All crew members, including 42 officers and 603 sailors, are now reported missing. The ship sank the German raider with artillery fire, but since then, no information has been received from it, so it must be considered that the ship has now sunk. Aircraft and warships are still conducting extensive reconnaissance in the hope of finding survivors of the ship. Due to military strategy, it was previously inconvenient to publish this news. The loss of this excellent warship and its brave crew is regrettable, but the Australian people are also proud of the ship's ability to maintain the traditional spirit of the Australian Navy and its glorious record in previous battles against the enemy. The Steiermark was known as Raider No. 41 and sailed under the name Kormoran. The Greek ship Antonis and the British ships British Union and African Star were all victims of its violence. The ship then cooperated with another armed merchant ship to sink the British ship Eurylochus. After that, the ship operated in the South Pacific and sank the Agni Thaiti and Eithon in March and April of this year. In June, the two ships Velivit and Mariba were sunk by it between Ceylon and Sumatra. On September 26, the Greek ship Kandiclicos 1 was again victimized.</p>
<h3>Vichy Reiterates Determination to Defend Vietnam and Resist Invasion by Any Country</h3>
<p>Havas, Vichy, 1st - A government spokesman said, "If war breaks out in the Pacific, France is determined to continue to defend Vietnam against aggression, regardless of which country the aggression comes from." When asked what attitude France would take if the Japanese army attacked Thailand from its base in Vietnam, the government spokesman replied, "This matter does not seem likely to happen for the time being. Even the Prime Minister of Thailand gave a speech in Bangkok on the 27th of last month, saying that according to reliable news, the Japanese army in Vietnam has no ambition to invade Thailand, nor does the British army in Malaya. Even if this factor changes, the French government will review the new situation in the Pacific based on realistic policies."</p>

<h3>The United States Possesses a Powerful Fleet Sufficient to Handle Two-Ocean Incidents; Knox Publishes an Article Announcing Naval Strength; Gerold Claims Japan Can Be Crushed in Months</h3>
<p>Paris, 1st (Havas) – Official announcement: Marshal Pétain today met with German Aviation Minister General Göring in Saint-Florentin, Yonne department, in the German-occupied zone.</p>
<p>Vichy, 1st (Havas) – Pétain and Darlan returned here at 10:30 tonight.</p>
<p>Paris, 2nd (Haitong) – The German Embassy here held an intelligence conference. After the German Ambassador, Abetz, read the official report on the Pétain-Göring talks, Mei, a representative of the French Foreign Ministry, followed.</p>
<p>New York, 2nd (Havas) – Secretary of the Navy Knox recently published an article in a certain magazine, explaining the strength of the U.S. Navy. It is said that the United States today possesses the most powerful fleet in the world. "Whether an incident occurs in one ocean or two, we can handle it with ease. Moreover, due to the expansion of bases in various locations and the construction of a large number of auxiliary ships, the activity of our navy has greatly expanded. As for our strength, we already have seventeen battleships, with fifteen under construction; seven aircraft carriers, with eleven under construction; thirty-seven cruisers, with fifty-four under construction; and one hundred and thirteen destroyers, with seventy-three under construction. The U.S. Navy has a total of 5,800 aircraft of all types, including training aircraft. Once the current military expansion plan is fully realized, the number of naval fighters alone will increase to as many as 15,000. Moreover, the equipment of each aircraft is novel, the speed is high, and the firepower is even greater. In addition, the accuracy of U.S. warships' firing is extremely high. The naval authorities spare no expense and often order each ship to practice target shooting. In the first year of the outbreak of this European war, the U.S. fleet consumed more shells in shooting practice than the British Navy used in combat. This is because British cruisers often do not fire a single shell for several days, while our warships are constantly practicing."</p>
<p>Washington, 2nd (United Press) – Former Minister to Thailand, Mr. Gerold, said yesterday, "If Japan truly wants to fight, this is an opportunity of a lifetime. I believe that our people can crush them with superior naval power within months." He also said that he does not believe Japan currently dares to take actions in the Far East that would cause war, and added, "Japan's past megalomania has only led them to seize opportunities when there is no great danger. If we do not want to allow the Far Eastern door to be closed by Japan, then we must stop Japan. There is no compromise."</p>
<p>Washington, 1st (United Press) – The Chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, Mr. May, today urged President Roosevelt to warn Japan that if Japan does not abandon its ambition for a South Asian empire, the United States will bomb Japan by sea and land. Mr. May said that if Japan advances southward, Congress will approve declaring war on Japan now. Americans hate Japan more than Hitler, and said that if American planes can be used to protect the Burma Road, they can also be used to bomb Tokyo.</p>
<p>Washington, 2nd (United Press) – Senator Thomas, a Democratic senator from Utah, said yesterday that the firm stance of the United States can save the Far Eastern situation. He said, "If the United States takes a firm stand, it will be powerful enough to save the situation, because all countries related to the Pacific Ocean, whether in logic or principle, are standing with us. The pressure exerted on Japan is almost equal to war. I believe that the Japanese will have the same observation as the whole world, knowing that the peace of the Far East will be preserved under the wise leadership of the United States."</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Recovery of Rostov</h3>
<p>The large army under the command of the Soviet Union's southern route, Timoshenko, began its offensive against the German forces a week ago. After nearly a week of fierce fighting, on the 29th of last month, the key southern route city of Rostov was completely recovered. This news has been officially announced by the Soviet side, and the German side has also acknowledged it.</p>
<p>This is the first important victory for the Soviet army since the German-Soviet war. Of course, this is just a local attempted offensive, and it may not immediately develop into a full-scale and decisive counter-offensive. However, in terms of significance, it at least shows two points: First, the Soviet army has a strong reserve force and has always maintained the strength to turn defense into offense. Second, the Soviet army's supreme commander's strategic command is excellent, and he indeed has the ability to seize opportunities and take the initiative. In the more than five months of fighting since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the recovery of Rostov is indeed a change of face under the situation of the German army's consistent advance and the Soviet army's constant defensive posture, which makes general observers feel refreshed. We can easily imagine that the encouragement of this important victory must have unprecedentedly boosted the morale of the Soviet army. As for the encouragement received by the Allied forces in Europe and the entire anti-aggression front in the world, and the strengthening of confidence in the final victory, it goes without saying.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the actual impact of this victory of the Soviet army in the southern route on the German-Soviet situation is also very significant.</p>
<p>First, it blocked the German army's advance towards the Caucasus head-on. When the German army's second offensive was blocked and the third offensive was launched, its left wing had gathered very strong military strength and equipment and tried its best to rush into Ukraine, occupying several key points in one fell swoop and reaching the Dnieper River. In the fourth offensive, although its main target was Moscow, the southern route's attack has never stopped. As a result, Rostov, a key Soviet industrial, military, and transportation hub, was occupied, reaching the Don River basin and the Donets Basin. In addition to this, it also launched a major battle on the Crimean Peninsula, and within more than a month, it had almost completely occupied all the important points on the island. And the Soviet army's greatest reliance on blocking the German army in Crimea from advancing towards the Caucasus is, of course, the naval power now arrayed in the Sea of Azov and the eight-mile-wide sea surface completely under Soviet control. Therefore, assuming that the German army started from Rostov and advanced directly towards the Baku oil fields and the Caucasus area, which are six hundred miles away, while also advancing south along the coast of the Sea of Azov, then not only would the Caucasus become a direct target of the war; even the Soviet navy now staying in the Sea of Azov would be under serious threat. Therefore, in this counter-offensive by the Soviet army, in addition to recovering Rostov in one fell swoop, it also launched a corresponding counter-offensive in Crimea, forcing the German army to retreat backwards. This at least greatly reduces the threat to the Caucasus in the near future.</p>
<p>More importantly, the German army's pressure on Moscow has also been greatly relaxed due to the Soviet army's recovery of Rostov. This time, the German army's all-out attack on Moscow has been going on for more than two months. Especially in the past ten days or so, the German army has been forced by the situation to face the desolate Soviet wilderness and the long winter, forcing it to do its final onslaught with all its strength near Moscow. However, with the large-scale gathering of the Soviet Moscow garrison and the determination to defend the land, the German army's strength to attack Moscow, if it does not greatly increase fresh troops and equipment, will in no way have any hope of defeating the Soviet army. However, the large number of German troops currently assembled has already created a very serious wintering problem for Hitler. If he now mobilizes fresh troops to launch a fifth offensive, then the problem of how to winter after the number of people increases will be even more serious. This is what Hitler currently considers very depressing. Under such a situation, the development of the war in the Donets Basin area has also had a very significant impact on the gain or loss of Moscow. According to the Soviet side, the German army once attempted to launch a large-scale breakthrough from the Kharkov and Donets River basin area towards the Don River basin, launching an unprecedentedly huge pincer movement against the Moscow area, while attempting to completely cut off the central Soviet army defending Moscow from the Soviet army defending the southern route. If the German army could really realize this attempt, then the threat to the Soviet army would undoubtedly be very serious. However, the Soviet army has now completely seen this point, so it launched an offensive in the southern route, eliminating this potential crisis and relaxing the German army's threat to Moscow.</p>
<p>The size of the forces used by the Soviet army in this southern route offensive has not yet been published with specific figures. And the recovery of Rostov is mostly due to its excellent strategy. It first defeated the German front west of Rostov in one fell swoop from the Donets River basin, putting the German army in the face of the danger of being surrounded and forcing it to retreat quickly. According to the official announcement from the Soviet side, four German divisions were completely annihilated, and another four divisions were completely disorganized. Then, the degree of the intensity of the war can also be imagined. The war is still developing. The German army has retreated to the area of ​​Melitopol, which is one hundred and dozens of miles away. As for whether the German army can stabilize its position here or launch a counter-offensive, it will of course depend on the size of the forces used by the Soviet army this time and the strength of the German reinforcements. This will probably be clear in the next few days.</p>
<h3>Food Procurement to be Completed Within the Year; Procurement in Various Provinces is Not Difficult; There is No Shortage of Military Food and Civilian Food</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The total amount of food procured nationwide this year is more than 60 million dan, of which the procurement in the northern provinces is mainly wheat, and it can be completed within the year. According to Food Minister Xu Kan's statement to a Central News Agency reporter on the 1st, after the amount of food procured in each province is stipulated, they have all started to handle it according to the procedure without any difficulty. Of the total of 60 million dan procured, most will be used as military food, and the rest will be distributed to various markets to supply civilian food and to adjust the shortage in grain-deficient provinces. For example, Guangdong and Fujian provinces will be supplied by Hunan and Jiangxi provinces nearby. After this, there is no need to worry about the lack of military food and civilian food nationwide. The local authorities in various provinces are working very hard to handle this matter, and it is expected that all procurement can be completed before the end of the year. Xu continued to talk about the procurement situation in Sichuan Province. It is said that the total amount of commercial procurement in Sichuan Province is 12 million dan. Since the opening of the micro-procurement on September 16, the amount of procurement has reached 8 million dan by the end of November, and the remaining 4 million dan can also be fully procured within the year. This year, about ten counties in eastern and northern Sichuan have suffered poor harvests, but the people are still enthusiastically responding to the procurement, and even after paying the grain, there are no grains left, but they have no complaints. Their enthusiasm for supporting the government is particularly inspiring. (1st dispatch)</p>
<h3>Gansu County System to be Implemented in Stages</h3>
<p>Lanzhou – The implementation of the new county system in Gansu Province began in July of last year. The reporter recently inquired Chairman Gu Zhenglun about the situation after a year and a half. He said that since the implementation of the new county system in the province, it has been carried out simultaneously in more than 60 counties in the province. There is a lack of talent and funds, so it is difficult to achieve significant results. Starting this year, in order to concentrate strength and create a model role, the provincial government has made changes according to the actual situation and stipulated that Lanzhou, Lintao, Minxian, Zhangye, Tianshui, Qingyang, etc. Eight counties are the first batch of implementation counties. As of now, this implementation method has achieved the expected results. The funds from the county to the townships have been enriched, and the personnel have also been improved. Recently, a training class has also been established to train office staff in order to equip cadres at all levels with a sound organization and a unified will, so as to achieve the effect of finger and arm coordination. It is expected that after these personnel graduate, the new county system in these eighteen counties can also be completed as scheduled, and it will be easier to promote it to other counties in the future.

<h3>Germany Two Years After the War</h3>
<p>The park is full of children's mothers and old people all day long. The young ones are playing ball, and if they are not careful, they will fall on the side of the road.</p>
<p>Will Germany go to war with the United States? When I arrived in Berlin in the autumn of 1940, German officials only said, "It would be extremely foolish for the United States to join the war." But by the late spring of 1941, some officials believed that not only was the Yugoslavian incident and the war with Britain prolonged, but the United States should be fully responsible for it, and that the United States should also be responsible for this European war. They firmly said: Since 1933, Germany has been wary of the conspiracies of the international Jews gathered around Roosevelt, and Poland, France, and Yugoslavia were sacrificed because they mistakenly believed in rumors under the United States' crazy desire to destroy Germany. Some people also said that Britain is just the cat's paw of the United States.</p>
<p>Even the rich rarely wear high-quality leather shoes, let alone the middle class. Of course, they are nowhere to be seen. Ordinary people wear wooden shoes, and walking on the road is like a prototype of Japan. Even privileged classes cannot buy genuine leather shoes, and even imitation leather shoes must be purchased with special permission.</p>
<p>The coffee you drink in the cafe doesn't taste like coffee, and the tea doesn't taste like tea: the ice cream you eat is called "Farbón L.G. Farben (a dye trust)", and the cigarettes you smoke are called "dry grass".</p>
<p>More than half of the women in Berlin make a living by working, but there are a large group of women dressed in fancy clothes along Kurfürstendamm and Unter den Linden. Although there are rumors of forced labor, they don't seem willing to work in factories.</p>
<p>There are many good tennis courts in Berlin, but they are rarely used due to the lack of tennis balls. High-altitude artillery has been installed in the Wensie Golf Club. This year, because there are many members in the army, the scores of the gambling games are not announced, so I don't know which horse is an underdog and which horse is favored by everyone. However, people who are familiar with the inside story know that when it is announced fifteen minutes after the race, the winner must be present in person, and even at a high price, you can't buy golf balls in the country, so it is not very crowded. Most of the people who play golf are Japanese, and most of the people watching on the balcony are upper-class Germans and foreign officials wearing Scottish tweed suits, with blonde and blue-eyed women. The best tip for the club waiters is not money, but cigarettes or food stamps.</p>
<p>Horse races are held as usual. The spectators are still crowded, and their calmness is the same as in other parts of the world, but the actual profit never exceeds the capital by a factor of two, and sometimes it is not even enough to cover the cost. Part of the reason is that the national taxes are heavy, and part of the reason is that the rebates from the racetrack are too high due to the heavy taxes, but there are still many people who gamble.</p>
<p>In the summer, the cafes, golf courses, and racetracks in Berlin are certainly more lively due to the warm weather, but the lives of most Germans who make a living by labor have not changed much. Labor in Germany is not more relaxed in the summer than in the winter, and the working hours are the same. Men work 60 hours a week, and most women work 56 hours.</p>
<p>The monthly allocation of soap is only enough to wash your hands once a day and take a bath once a week, and it is often used up by the end of the third week. Hot water is a luxury, and apartments in the city only have it on Friday and Saturday evenings. It is very difficult for housewives to buy pots, pans, porcelain, and coffee pots. In fact, various household utensils are no longer seen in stores. Even if people have money, they can't buy cameras, telescopes, watches, typewriters, radios, and gold and silver utensils.</p>
<p>The summer days in Germany are very long, and it doesn't get dark until ten o'clock. Most Germans spend their time either taking a walk in the park or having a beer and chatting with each other. They also go to see thunder films in groups, but children with knowledge over the age of eleven or twelve also feel unhappy when they see such films. Operas and dramas are good, but they are too expensive.</p>
<p>May 1st is called National Labor Day in Germany. That labor front swindler Lei said: Our work is so difficult, our achievements are so great, I</p>
<p>One day in early June, I saw three well-dressed children playing together in a park in Berlin. Two four- or five-year-old boys turned their tricycles over and sat between the two rear wheels, holding the front wheel with their hands. They were supposed to be airplane pilots. A girl of about six years old drew a large square frame on the ground near the tricycles. She told them, "This is the airplane field below." She also drew a small square frame in the corner and said, "This is the hangar. The older boy got off the car and drew many crosses in the square frame and said, "These are the airplanes. He and another boy filled a few bags with stones, got on the plane, and threw the stones at the airplane field, shouting loudly when the stones landed! Boom! The airplane field was destroyed," and they began a fierce battle. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>South Route Defeated German Army: Retreat Cut Off by Soviets; Fate of Annihilation in Days; Red Army Gains Much Booty in Rostov Battle</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd: A Kubyshev radio broadcast stated that the fate of the Nazi troops defeated at Rostov has been decided, and they may be annihilated within days. Currently, the scattered remnants of the Nazis are not only being fiercely pursued by the victorious Soviet army, but their retreat has also been cut off. The only remaining escape route for the Germans is to retreat to the Sea of Azov and perish. The radio also stated that the defeated German army has been surrounded by Soviet forces from all directions and is in a desperate situation, being gradually eliminated.</p>
<p>TASS, South Route, 2nd: A correspondent for Izvestia reported that after the Red Army recaptured Rostov, it continued to advance rapidly, retaking many villages and towns each day. The vanguard of the Red Army is now further away from Rostov. The German army is attempting to resist our advance, and fierce battles have broken out in several areas, but our army continues to advance rapidly. Steel-Jacket-Off's troops advanced 30 kilometers in one day, and other units are also rapidly advancing as the enemy continues to retreat in disarray. Our army continues to advance westward, and as of December 1st, our army had advanced another 50 kilometers after recapturing Rostov.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 2nd: The Soviet Information Bureau stated that in the victory at Rostov, the spoils captured included 28 tanks, 120 artillery pieces, 306 machine guns, 178 grenade launchers, over 4,000 rifles, 871 trucks, and a large amount of other military equipment. 102 enemy aircraft were also shot down. These figures are only preliminary estimates and are not yet complete, as the Soviet army is still engaged in the offensive and has not been able to thoroughly inspect all the spoils.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd: A Reuters military commentator stated that the situation in the Moscow area is still quite confused. Although newspapers report Soviet victories in Tula, there has been no decisive change. The German side claims to have made some progress northwest of Moscow, but their communiqué lacks conviction. The disposition and strength of the Soviet forces cannot yet be disclosed, but the names of the former commanders of the three fronts are now known. The Leningrad Soviet army, which is now cut off from the central and southern districts, is commanded by General Gusin. The supreme commander in Moscow is General Sukov, assisted by Generals Rokossovsky, Gutorkov, and Chumarkov. Gutorkov and Gutonev are commanders under Zhukov. Marshal Tomusenko is the supreme commander of the southern front, with Lieutenant General Chelevingerko, Generals Remisov, and Karetonov as his deputies.</p>
<p>Northern Route Battles Fierce; German Deaths Numerous</p>
<p>TASS, Galerria, Day Unknown: The battles on the Stenengrad front in the northern route remain extremely fierce. The German "Norton" SS Division recently attacked Loki Station, resulting in a major defeat, with numerous dead and wounded, and corpses littering the battlefield for kilometers. Currently, the battle on the left flank is still in full swing, and our army's fierce counter-offensive is quite successful. The battle for Highland F is extremely fierce. Although the enemy is resisting stubbornly, our army has occupied the eastern part and continues to advance. On the Murmansk front, our army is holding its ground and strengthening defenses. A certain high ground abandoned by the Germans in early November is still under fierce attack by the Finnish army, who are attempting to retake the area, but have failed, losing over 500 men.</p>
<p>Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Denounces Shameless German Lies</p>
<p>TASS, Kubyshev, 2nd: At a reception for foreign journalists, Soviet Deputy Director of Intelligence, Luo Chaevsky, answered reporters' questions, saying, "The recapture of Rostov is neither the first nor the last blow to the German army. At the same time, the Red Army's victory and the defeat of General von Kleist's troops have shattered the myth of the German army's 'invincibility' and prevented the enemy from continuing to advance. After the German defeat, the German command issued absurd communiqués in an attempt to cover it up, claiming that 'the German retreat was aimed at retaliating against the Soviet people with all their might, because the latter had violated international law by attacking the German rear.' This is a pure lie, and such lies only prove the German side's panic. When the German side occupied Rostov, they declared to the outside world that 'the Soviet people warmly welcomed the German army' and regarded the German army as 'liberators.' But in what a short time have these 'liberators' denounced the 'ungrateful' Soviet people of the city. As for the German side's claim that the Soviet people violated international law, it is even more absurd, because if a bandit breaks into a house, the owner cannot be considered to be breaking the law by driving him out."</p>
<h3>North African Axis Forces: Bitter Fighting Achieves Contact; British Encirclement Temporarily Broken; Both Sides Continue Bloody Battles in Three Areas</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd: According to the latest communiqué from the British Middle East forces, fierce fighting continued yesterday in the main battle area of Rechie due to the Axis forces attempting to link up with the Axis troops east of Tobruk and north of Rechie at Chaferan, six or seven miles away, with the tanks and armored vehicles that General Rommel could gather on the Axis side joining the bitter fighting. The Axis forces suffered heavy losses, but contact has been made. At the same time, the British army in the border area continues to annihilate the encircled Axis forces. In yesterday's battle, the British Air Force again provided close support to the ground forces, constantly attacking enemy armored vehicles and mechanized transport units around the Rechie area. In the desert southwest of the main battlefield, the British mechanized forces in Gelo have resumed operations after being re-equipped and refueled. There is currently no new information from the British reconnaissance teams attacking enemy troops south of Benghazi. There are now more enemy aircraft in the skies over Libya, but air supremacy is still in the hands of the British Air Force, as exemplified by the major battle in the skies over Cobi on Sunday, when British aircraft shot down 15 enemy aircraft while only losing 3 of their own. Today's German communiqué mentioned the Libyan campaign, saying that the battles southeast of Tobruk in the past few days have been favorable to the German and Italian armies.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd: Axis forces in the Rechie area of Cyrenaica briefly broke through the British lines, but the British forces counterattacked, driving them back and re-establishing their positions. The enemy infantry involved in the battle, likely German soldiers, arrived by truck about four days ago and infiltrated the British lines from the east to assist the enemy 15th Armored Division advancing from the west. Fierce fighting continues in this area. Although more enemy aircraft are appearing in the skies over the Libyan triangle war zone, the British Air Force still maintains air supremacy, as demonstrated by the downing of 18 enemy aircraft in the aerial battle over Cobi on Sunday. British aircraft not only protect the ground forces, but also search for and attack Axis aircraft to prevent them from launching attacks. Cairo officials stated that from the start of the Libyan offensive at dawn on November 18 to midnight on November 30, 176 enemy aircraft in North Africa have been destroyed, of which 90 were shot down in the air, and the British have suffered significant losses.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd: A Reuters correspondent in the 8th Army on the northern front reported that attacks and counterattacks continue in the Rechie area. The German army has launched an offensive, apparently attempting to cut off the British forces in the area from the main British forces in the Tobruk area. Yesterday's battle can be likened to a sandwich, with the German army being the sausage in between two slices of bread, and the British army being the fingers holding the two sides of the sandwich, holding tighter and tighter. The outcome is not yet apparent. According to a communiqué from the British Middle East Command, the battle in Cyrenaica is now divided into three main areas: (1) the main front southeast of Tobruk, where the British forces advancing from the southeast have linked up with the British forces who have successfully attacked from the Tobruk fortress; (2) the border area from Heerfa to positions north of Omar; (3) the southwest of the Gello area, from Toutou to the main front of Rechie and Hammet. Heavy fighting all day last Sunday, with the enemy attacking from the southwest in the morning and being repelled by the British armored forces south of Rechie.</p>

<h3>U.S. Advises Individual Evacuations; Batch of British Nationals Leaves Shanghai Today; Three British Ships Have Already Left Southward with Nationals; Dozens of U.S. Citizens Take French Ship to Philippines; Rumors of a Shutdown at British Merchant Shipping Company</h3>
<p>Nearly 200 British nationals, mostly women and children, left Shanghai at 12:00 noon today on the British evacuation ship Anhui, bound for Singapore via Hong Kong. The number of passengers is the same as on ordinary ships. Those in first and second class are older and unable to withstand the rigors of the journey. Among the evacuating British nationals are many Indians, most of whom will disembark in Hong Kong and transfer to ships bound for Australia. The Indian nationals are going to Calcutta. Luggage was loaded onto the ship at Taikoo Wharf yesterday. According to yesterday's notice from the British Consul-General, Indian nationals were required to board the ship at 9:00 this morning, and British nationals were required to board the ship before 11:00. The ship weighed anchor and left Shanghai at 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>British and American Evacuations Continue Actively</p>
<p>Although there are reports of continued negotiations between the United States and Japan, the British and American evacuations of nationals residing in the occupied areas of China continue actively and have not been relaxed. The Taikoo Company's Liangzhou ship left Shanghai southward yesterday afternoon, and the Yuezhou ship also weighed anchor at 10:00 last night, carrying British nationals to Hong Kong. The Anhui ship is carrying more than 200 British nationals and left for Hong Kong and Singapore this afternoon. The Jardine Matheson's Yisheng and Fusheng ships, coming to Shanghai from Hong Kong, were expected to arrive last Saturday, but as late as this Monday, they had not yet arrived in Shanghai. When asked about this, the company said that heavy fog was slowing their progress and that they would probably arrive yesterday morning. However, as of yesterday evening, the two ships had still not arrived. The company has no information, so it is uncertain whether these two ships will arrive. In addition, the French Company's postal ship General Joffre is scheduled to leave this morning at 8:00 AM, returning to Vietnam via Luzon. A group of about 60 to 70 U.S. citizens are taking this postal ship to the Philippines to return to the United States.</p>
<p>Rumors of a Shutdown at British Company</p>
<p>It is rumored that British Merchant Steam Navigation Company, the largest shipping agency in the Far East, will only send its ships as far as Hong Kong, and will not come to Shanghai for nearly a year. Therefore, in addition to handling transit goods, the company has reduced its work. Chinese staff are being laid off one after another, and there are recent rumors of a complete shutdown. However, the company has not yet made a formal announcement.</p>

The U.S. Consulate-General recently announced the evacuation of U.S. citizens through newspapers, but the advice issued yesterday was sent to individual U.S. citizens or families, and is the latest recommendation from the U.S. and British authorities for citizens to evacuate due to the dense war clouds in the East. According to consulate statistics, there are currently about 2,500 U.S. citizens in the Shanghai consulate district, including 450 to 500 Filipinos. 2,400 live in Shanghai, and only 100 to 125 are scattered in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui.</p>

The agreement of March of last year was proposed by Japanese Consul-General Miura Yoshiaki to transfer the police authority of the public concession north of the Suzhou Creek to a Japanese district chief and police officers, most of whom are Japanese. Negotiations on this matter have been intermittent, and now it has been announced that the process is complete amidst talk of "changing the police department's structure," which is being closely watched by all parties.</p>

<p>Council Flour Sales Still Plan to Lower Price</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Municipal Council began selling flour at the Municipal Council building to reputable merchants such as bakeries and noodle shops at a price of 40 yuan per bag. The Council has also formulated a plan to take firm action to limit the price of flour to about 36 yuan per bag. The Council will first register all flour stocks in the Public Concession, and then find a number of bags of flour in the city. After the work is completed, the Council's Price Control Office will begin selling flour to reputable merchants. It is reported that yesterday morning, those who went to the Council building to buy flour far exceeded the amount of flour obtained by the Council.</p>
<p>Conference Today to Limit Price and Dump</p>
<p>With the first stage of the Municipal Council's lowering of flour prices completed, a conference is scheduled to be held today to formulate the second stage of the process. In order to preserve the flour stocks within the Concession, the Council may implement the same regulations as those for rice, that is, purchase a large amount of flour and then dump it on the market at a limited price, and prohibit those who do not have a special permit from transporting it out of the Public Concession. The fourth batch of flour ordered by the Municipal Council through importers in this city, totaling 64,000 bags, is expected to arrive in Shanghai in the latter half of this month. The fifth batch of 12,000 bags is expected to be shipped to Shanghai in January. A responsible person from the Municipal Council recently denied the rumors that the Council had ordered rice from Thailand to be shipped to Shanghai. It is said that the Council will consider various proposals for selling rice, including those from Thailand, but has not formulated a definite plan to purchase rice from Thailand.</p>
<p>Make Every Effort to Lower the Cost of Living</p>
<p>The Municipal Council held a routine meeting yesterday to discuss various aspects of the city's economic situation. The Coal Committee also met to thoroughly discuss issues such as the import of coal, paying close attention to the two points of freight and shipping convenience. The Council is working hard to lower the high cost of living. Although it encounters various difficulties, there are also reasons for optimism, namely that the various banks and insurance companies have guaranteed the authorities their wholehearted cooperation. Each bank will report monthly details of its rice purchase assistance, such as the names of the rice purchasers and the quantities purchased. Each insurance company will report the amount of rice insured to it. Another welcome development is that the organization of the Municipal Council's Price Control Office is more effective, and a flour office has been added. It is also learned that the Municipal Council has been studying the issue of coal for a long time, and has transferred Teef, a specialist from the Works Department, to the Price Control Office to handle coal issues. It is rumored that the Municipal Council has already prepared to sell the flour in the Puxi warehouses.</p>
<p>Rice Supply Also Available in West Shanghai</p>
<p>The Municipal Council has decided that residents in the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Roads Area can purchase foreign rice, starting today (3rd), and will set up a temporary foreign rice retail outlet at the intersection of Great Western Road and Edinburgh Road, selling Municipal Council foreign rice, limited to one dou per person.</p>

<p>This newspaper's readers' tuition aid fund received 100 yuan yesterday from little brother Yu Qunyan, who saved the money from his candy allowance, to be used as aid to help out-of-school youths. His enthusiasm and righteous act is truly touching. A child of school age has not been in the world long, and his knowledge is still shallow, yet he generously donated money, reducing his own enjoyment, to help poor and out-of-school youths. His spirit of courageously doing good is extremely precious, and it is also due to the virtue of his parents and the influence of family education. Secondly, Mr. Shen Fengbiao, a waiter at the Continental Hotel, has been donating 20 yuan per month since this newspaper's first round of tuition aid fundraising until now, half a year later, without interruption, and he personally delivers it on the first of each month, keeping his promise without wavering.

<p>The Dingfeng Rice Shop at 37 Guangxi Road sold rice and it was found that there were cases of adulteration, and the adulterated rice was sold at a high price of 190 yuan per dan. All of the above are violations of the regulations and have been notified to the Police Department, which has ordered each of the shops to temporarily suspend business for three days starting from today (3rd) to show punishment, and a notice with red characters on a white background is posted at the entrance of each shop, which reads, "This shop has been ordered to suspend business for three days for selling goods exceeding the prescribed maximum price, and is only allowed to resume business at 6:00 PM on the 6th of this month. If this shop has this situation again, the suspension period will be further extended. If citizens discover cases of selling prices exceeding the limit, they should report it to this Bureau for cooperation."</p>
<p>Sincerely Hope Citizens Will Report Honestly</p>
<p>If citizens discover the above-mentioned situations, they can attach solid evidence and report to this Bureau for verification and handling. All shops must comply with the announcement issued by this Bureau on November 29 when selling goods, and issue an invoice.

<h3>Christmas and New Year Cards - Hoping to Avoid Sending - Post Office Lacks Manpower - Transportation Also Difficult</h3>
<p>According to the local post office, post offices everywhere currently lack manpower, and the transportation of mail to the southwest and northwest is extremely difficult. Christmas this year and the New Year next year are fast approaching. If a large number of greeting cards are sent, it will inevitably hinder the rapid delivery of important letters. Therefore, it is requested that all sectors refrain from sending greeting cards to the southwest and northwest regions. As for greeting cards sent overseas, they can still be sent as usual.</p>
<h3>Mail to France Must Indicate - Whether to Send to Occupied Zone</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Post Office announced that it has now received notification from the French Post Office that normal postal relations between occupied areas of that country have been cut off, so mail sent by various countries to French occupied areas, after arriving in unoccupied areas, cannot be forwarded and delivered to the addressee. This mail must have the words "Postal Service Interrupted" added to the envelope before being returned to the original sending post office. In order to facilitate delivery, all mail sent to France should have the words "Occupied Zone" or "Unoccupied Zone" added below the destination address on the envelope by the sender, in order to distinguish them and avoid misdirection.</p>
<h3>Detailed Account of Expanded Christian Evangelism in This City</h3>
<p>The Christian Expanded Evangelism campaign, which lasted for a week, has already been reported in the newspapers. From November 10th to 16th, meetings were held every evening from 7:30 to 9:30 at six churches: Moore Memorial Church on Yu Qiaqing Road, Tian'an Church on Shandong Road, St. Paul's Church in the Foreign Concession on Sanma Road, All Saints' Church on Lafayette Road, the Chinese Christian Church on Kang Nao Tuo Road, and the Jesus Church on Maitesi Road.

Due to Moore Memorial Church's convenient location, it was full every night, both upstairs and downstairs. Tian'an Church, the Chinese Christian Church, and St. Paul's Church were next, and the All Saints' Church and the Jesus Church also had many listeners, ranging from two or three hundred to four or five hundred people. In addition, a gospel car was dispatched, traveling from western Shanghai all the way to Yangshupu, singing hymns and playing music along the main roads, and distributing leaflets exhorting people to the world. Public buses and trams in the Public Concession also posted Bible slogans. The reception at each church was most meticulous at Tian'an Church, which was organized by itself, with clear positions and orderly responses. St. Paul's Church, the Chinese Christian Church, the Jesus Church, and All Saints' Church were also not weak. Moore Memorial Church was hosted by the Ling Gong Society and was even more enthusiastic. The choirs included male and female choirs from Bethel Church, Tian'an Church, and the China and China United, wearing pure white robes, going to various churches to praise God.

<h3>Detective Force of the International Settlement Arrests Thief - Confiscates Han Jade Teapot</h3>
<p>The intersection of North Henan Road and Bazi Road in the Public Concession is the turning point for trolleybuses on Route 14 and Route 18 and buses on Route 5. Because of the North Railway Station of Kunsu, most merchants and travelers traveling to and from the area take vehicles there to enter various parts of the concession. As a result, pickpockets and other vagrants specialize in using their nimble hands in that area, and travelers are victimized every day. Although the detective force of the International Settlement has repeatedly arrested petty thieves and brought them to justice, they have recently become rampant again. Therefore, Chief Inspector Feng Baidun, Deputy Inspector Huang Fusen, and Detectives Liu Zhaonian and Ma Bingzhang of the detective force disguised themselves as country bumpkins, carrying bags, and conducted a thorough investigation yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM. As a result, seven thieves were arrested near the intersection of North Henan Road and Bazi Road while committing thefts. According to their confessions, a large number of stolen goods were found in the nearby place where they hid the stolen goods. It was also heard that there was a Han jade teapot among the stolen goods, which was indeed an antique of great value. It is currently being investigated from whom it was stolen.</p>
<h3>Boy Missing - Ransom of 200,000 - Eight People Involved Detained - Trial and Sentencing Scheduled</h3>
<p>Sui Kang, the three-year-old son of Mr. Qian, the owner of Fuchang Plank Box Factory at No. 34 Rehe Road, went out to play with his cook, Shen Xichu, Liu Mingda, and his relative Ma Erbao, on the afternoon of October 21 at 2:20 PM, and never returned. Later, a letter was received from the bandits stating that the child was currently somewhere in Jiangyin and that he could be returned for a payment of 200,000 yuan.

<h3>All Banks Have Unlimited Liability for Savings Deposits - Most Chinese and Foreign Banks Are Unwilling to Follow the Temporary Measures of Datong Bank This Time</h3>
<p>Since the American Datong Bank notified depositors that customers would be responsible for the risk of deposits, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency specifically visited the responsible personnel of other friendly banks and the four Chinese banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture, and various Chinese merchant banks yesterday. They all expressed their unwillingness to follow Datong Bank's approach, and said that the Savings Bank Law promulgated by the Chinese government stipulates, "When ordinary banks concurrently operate savings bank business, the assets and liabilities of the savings department and the banking department should be divided independently. The assets of the savings department shall not be affected by the bankruptcy of the banking department. When the assets of the savings bank are insufficient to repay the debts of each depositor, the directors and supervisors shall bear joint and unlimited liability. The joint and unlimited liability of the directors and supervisors mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall not be resolved until two years after resignation and registration." At the same time, the Measures for Managing Banks in Special Periods stipulate, "Banks that receive deposits, except for savings deposits which shall be handled in accordance with the Savings Bank Law, shall deposit 20% of the total amount of deposits received as reserve funds with the four Chinese banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture." Regarding the establishment of branches and savings trust departments by each bank, it is necessary to apply for approval in advance, so in fact, they all bear full responsibility.</p>
<h3>Private Smelting of Copper Coins - Prosecuted for the Crime of Damaging National Currency</h3>
<p>Ji Xiujuan, a detective of the Detective Force of the International Settlement, learned that Yixing Foundry at No. 28, Lane 898, Haining Road, had recently been buying copper coins, destroying them, melting them, and making profits. Therefore, he reported to the head of the Detective Force and, together with the Western detectives, Tuile, entered the foundry quietly at 3:40 PM one day. He saw Zhang Yinfu, Xu Haisheng, Wu Qingming, Zhu Miaoshun, Guo Huigui, Chuan Rongsheng, and other workers inside the foundry working. They were arrested on the spot, and the boss, Zhang Delin, fled cleverly through the back door. The detectives seized 2,330 unmelted copper coins and 16 pounds of copper ingots and brought them to the detective force, along with an iron stove, for custody. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Li Zhishan, the detective force's lawyer, filed a lawsuit for the crime of damaging national currency and requested an investigation. Then, the detectives presented the evidence for inspection. When questioned, the defendants confessed that the boss, Zhang Delin, bought the copper coins from someone from the countryside for 6.4 yuan per catty and that they were being used to make faucet heads, not to manufacture contraband, and requested forgiveness. They also hired lawyer Yu Enliang to defend them. Judge Huang Risheng ordered them to be returned to custody and to await sentencing.</p>
<h3>Strictly Investigate the Case of Colluding to Commit a Major Robbery</h3>
<p>Since the appalling case of colluding to rob a large quantity of cotton cloth at Yisheng Cotton Cloth Store at No. 5, Lane 473, Ningbo Road, occurred the day before yesterday, the police authorities, upon receiving the report, have paid close attention to the large-scale robbery.

<h3>Datong News Agency Rental Dispute Awaiting Judgment</h3>
<p>The rental problem in this city has become increasingly serious recently due to the excessive extortion by black-hearted second landlords. The premises at No. 221, No. 614 Nanjing Road, were rented by second landlord Wang Runtao from Xinda Xiang at a price of 50 yuan per month, and then subleased to Datong News Agency for 80 yuan per month (at that time, because the house was inside the blocked alley on Nanjing Road and had not yet been removed). However, Wang Runtao, taking advantage of the recent shortage of houses and high prices, forced the tenant to move out part of the premises unsuccessfully and secretly filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court to have part of the premises vacated. The case has been interrogated several times, and a judgment has been made. Wang Runtao took advantage of the situation and filed a lawsuit with the Second High Branch Court, requesting that the tenant move out completely in order to achieve the goal of transferring the property at a high price. After receiving the complaint, the Second High Branch Court opened a hearing yesterday morning at 9:00 AM by Judge Zhuang. The case is clear and will be pronounced on the 8th.</p>

<h3>Preparing to Build the Sanzang Abode - Awaiting Continued Board Meeting to Proceed</h3>
<p>Shanghai's Xiyuan Temple is a branch of Suzhou's Xiyuan Temple. The temple is a famous jungle north and south of the Yangtze River, with a large collection of scriptures. This summer, elders Chen Kuilong, Shen Qiquan, and Ji Longtu, etc., proposed to build the Sanzang Abode for the temple because there was no place for lecturing and preaching in Shanghai. When soliciting basic initiators, more than 200 people enthusiastically participated, all of whom had a great knowledge of the classics.

However, Zhu suddenly claimed that he had circled Xie Yanxin and 10 others from the directors as executive directors, responsible for the general affairs, research, and economic departments of the association, and that there was no need to hold another election. Dai Chunfeng, an attending director who was also one of those circled, immediately spoke in public, stating that the association had not yet been registered and that, in order to have legal qualifications and for internal administration to conform to the organization of social groups, he had submitted a suggestion in writing for reference. However, Zhu expressed that it was too troublesome. As a result, all the attending directors believed that the suggestion was the responsibility of the directors and should not be taken lightly. As a result, the association's affairs were suspended, and all suggestions were submitted to the next standing committee meeting for public discussion and gradual implementation.</p>

<h3>Engineers Association Decides to Promote Industrial Standardization - Engineering Societies Establish Committees</h3>
<p>(Guiyang Hangxun) At the tenth annual meeting of the Chinese Engineers Association, the discussion on the issue of "Industrial Standardization" concluded on the third day of the conference. The conference was held at the Southwest Highway Zhongshan Hall, with more than 50 experts attending. First, Chairman Ouyang Lun reported on the promotion of industrialization in our country, followed by Wu Chengluo's report on the regulation of the metrology system in our country, and Gu Yu's report on the central industrial test site for the standardization of chemistry, electricity, materials, and machinery. Then, a discussion began on Yun Zhen's proposal to first seek to solve the difficulties of standardization and the methods of promotion in the future. Yun offered three points of opinion on the promotion method: the supply side, the application side, and the government and academic group side should jointly formulate a draft standard to carry out a large-scale standardization movement to arouse general attention and awareness. The above proposals were passed by the whole body, and the chairman proposed the proposal of the board of directors last year to organize the Chinese Engineering Standards Promotion Association. It was resolved that the association should draft the articles of association and proceed independently, and closely cooperate with the competent authorities and the engineering standards committees of various specialized associations and related groups. The final conclusion is that industrial standardization is very important for the future completion of the defense industry. The association should establish an industrial standards promotion association in the future to actively promote the industrial standardization movement by contacting public and private institutions and organizations, and to obtain contact with consumers, manufacturers, and distributors at any time. After the conference, engineering societies such as water conservancy, machinery, civil engineering, chemistry, mining, metallurgy, and electrical engineering all held separate meetings and unanimously established engineering standards committees for each department.</p>

<h3>London Chinese Government Bonds Soar: Domestic Bonds Begin to Recover but Remain Weak</h3>
<p>London, 1st (Monday) Telegram: Today's listing of Chinese foreign bonds and stocks of British and American companies in the Far East shows a rise in Chinese government bonds. Crisp and Reorganization (British-French) bonds from the previous period each rose by 5 pounds, with the former at 37 pounds and the latter at 43 and a half pounds. Sino-French American Dollar and British-French (British-French) bonds each rose by 4 pounds, with the former at 51 pounds and the latter at 52 pounds. British-German Continuing (British-French) bonds rose by 3 pounds, to 53 pounds, and British-Kexin rose by 1 pound, to 15 pounds. Among the railway bonds from the previous period, Daoqing, Jinpu Original Continuing, and Guangjiu each rose by 3 pounds, with Daoqing at 20 pounds and Jinpu and Guangjiu each at 18 pounds. Hukwang Non-German-French bonds rose by 1 pound, to 19 pounds. The rest each rose by 2 pounds, with Beining at 72 pounds, Hukwang German-French and Longhai at 17 pounds, and Jinghu at 10 pounds. As for British stocks, only HSBC shares showed a downward trend, with London registered shares falling by 2 and a half pounds, to 75 pounds, and Hong Kong registered shares falling by 2 pounds, to 83 pounds, with trading inactive. There were no other changes.</p>
<p>Although the unofficial bond market showed a slight recovery yesterday, it still felt weak. Typically, during rebounds, trading becomes active, but yesterday's trading actually decreased significantly, indicating that people were still focused on the US-Japan negotiations. At the opening yesterday morning, Runde and Renfeng made purchases, but they were unable to push prices up. Type C bonds failed to reach 8 yuan from morning to evening, and Type E bonds, although approaching the lottery draw, only rose by 5 fen. Because Lianyi, Yuxing, and Hongda were selling, the market still felt unable to rise. In the afternoon, Tongkang and Gongmao made purchases, while Lianyi continued to sell. Yitai also sold off, and the market remained flat, with trading significantly reduced. As a result, except for Type D bonds, which rose by 5 jiao due to small openings in the past two days, the rest rose by 5 fen to 8 jiao. The volume of transactions was approximately 1.3 million yuan. A summary table is provided below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Bank of Communications stock were traded at a price of 130 yuan each.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's stock market opened with firm prices, and short sellers made slight replenishments after the opening. However, due to the significant gains already made and the lack of definite progress in the situation, most operators were watching and waiting, so the market remained range-bound with no major fluctuations.</p>
<h3>Yarn Loses Momentum: Floating with the Market, Buying High and Selling Low</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose and then fell, but the situation remained volatile. In reality, people sell when prices are high and buy when prices are low, so the current situation is still in flux. Major players buy when prices are low, while general retail investors view existing yarn as non-tradable and tend to sell. The highest price for 20s Double Horse yarn was 2,550 yuan, and the lowest price was 2,435 yuan.</p>
<p>Double Horse yarn opened in the morning, continuing the firm and bullish momentum from the previous day. The opening price was 2,515 yuan, and many people were covering their short positions. Shortly after, it rose to 2,550 yuan. Later, the price of the second session on the exchange fell, and market sentiment weakened, leading to more sellers. It fell to 2,480 yuan, but as prices fell, profit-takers began to cover their short positions again, pushing the price up to 2,565 yuan. However, the large players secretly sold off their holdings, causing the chips to loosen. As the market neared closing, it gradually declined, closing at 2,470 yuan. It was found that the transaction volume in the morning half-day totaled 2,850 bales. The afternoon situation was lackluster. The opening price was 2,460 yuan, and it rose slightly to 2,475 yuan. Suddenly, it was heard that the exchange price was loosening, and it fell back to close at 2,435 yuan.</p>
<p>The futures market for Gold Double Horse yarn was volatile and suddenly returned to a sluggish state. This was because the negotiations between the US and Japan had not shown any significant progress, and the overall situation had not been followed up with good news. Therefore, the general sentiment had not improved significantly. In addition, the unusually tight money supply greatly weakened the potential of the long positions. Although the market rose rapidly after each positive stimulus, it did not rise as much as it fell, indicating that the foundations of the yarn market were not yet solid. At the initial opening in the morning, the futures market for yarn was invigorated by the continued rise in the gold market and spot yarn prices, and there was a scramble to buy, especially among short sellers covering their positions. Therefore, the December contract opened at a high price of 2,570 yuan, rising by another 70 yuan. The January contract opened at 2,615 yuan, also up by 56 yuan. When the February contract opened, it coincided with the softening of factory orders, and there was already a downward trend. After entering, it continued to be weak, and by the afternoon, it had fallen by 30 to 50 yuan. Although the factory orders and the exchange were extremely volatile in the afternoon, the futures yarn was still stable, and although there was a low price for the day, the closing was considered firm. As a result of the seven rises and falls throughout the day, the contracts for each month were down by slightly less than 40 yuan. A table is provided below:</p>
<p>December January February</p>
<p>The situation for spot cotton was mediocre, but the majority of the market was watching and waiting for an opportunity to move.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market was volatile, rising and falling. It fell first due to the dangerous situation in the Far East, but then rose slightly due to purchases by brokers and short covering. As a result, the closing price rose or fell by two or three basis points compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market fell first due to cotton merchants selling short again, but then rose again due to purchases by speculators and the firm stock market. Yesterday's closing price rose by about one rupee each. It is predicted that the market will open lower by one and a half rupees today due to very bad political news.</p>
<h3>Rice Weevils Stirring, Mill Noodles: Uneven Joy and Sorrow</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's foreign rice: yesterday afternoon, the Taikoo Company's ship Beihai arrived in port with 10,200 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and it docked at Wharf No. 4 of the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession for unloading. A portion of Shanghai's rice merchants, especially rice dealers and large-scale hoarders, are making a final struggle, hoping to restore the rice market. Their rationale is, of course, related to the livelihood of a small number of people, but in reality, they want to destroy the Municipal Council's control. If the market can be opened, prices can rise and fall, and the Municipal Council's price limits will become a dead letter. This is their insidious and clever tactic. It is thought that the Municipal Council will never be deceived and will not abandon their efforts halfway, so that they will not be criticized for abandoning their responsibilities. Therefore, the national rice market did not open yesterday, which was a silent demonstration of passive resistance by the rice merchants against the government.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign noodle market was slightly lively, because the actual retail customers on this street had not been able to buy smoothly for a long time, and the demand gradually increased. The purchasing appetite of customers from other regions and hoarders was also good. However, those who held the goods were still willing to sell. Generally, retail investors, seeing that the market had sufficient supplies, that Hong Kong noodles were about to arrive, and that the current situation was volatile, believed that hoarding noodles was a long-term risk, so they mostly sought to sell at market prices. Therefore, supply and demand were evenly matched, and the market remained balanced. Dongzhan's Jinlong noodles were priced at 51-52 yuan, and Dongzhan's Australian noodle Bell Tower brand was priced at 54 and a half yuan. The imported registered noodles from Xizhan, Jinlong brand, were priced at 40 yuan and 39 and a half yuan, and cannonball noodles were priced at 41 yuan to 40 yuan, all similar to the previous market. However, wheat bran was selling well due to shortages.</p>
<h3>Bankers Unleashed: Gold Market's Rise Declines Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market initially rose and then fell. After repeatedly breaking through the 15,000 yuan mark, it immediately fell back. People were confused, as the US-Japan negotiations were approaching their final stage, and the future changes were still difficult to predict. Although Chen Ji and the goldsmiths had a good appetite, the banks and cash shops competed to sell, and the price immediately fell back after reaching 15,400 yuan, retreating to 14,300 yuan. In the end, it was 370 yuan lower. The total transaction volume for the day was approximately 23,000 taels.</p>
<p>Spot prices rise first, then fall.</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) continued the upward momentum from the previous day, suddenly breaking out of the 15,000 yuan mark. Opening at 9:00 AM at 15,100 yuan, the opening was 300 yuan higher, reaching 19,400 yuan. Xianghe, Shunyuan, and Tongkangyong cash shops sold continuously, and Tianyuan and securities brokers also sold, immediately causing a 600 yuan decline, retreating to 14,800 yuan. Chengji, Decheng, and Mingfeng absorbed the supply, raising the price to around 15,000 yuan for a long time, once rising to 15,200 yuan. At noon, Xianghe, Shunyuan, Gonghe, Xiangxingyong, and Hesheng continued to sell without stopping, and the price gradually declined and could not recover, retreating to 14,480 yuan at the noon close, at 14,530 yuan. The market opened strong at 2:00 PM, raising the price by 270 yuan, to 14,800 yuan. Xianghe, Yongcheng, securities brokers, Wanfeng, and Tian兀 took turns to sell forcefully, and the price gradually fell by 500 yuan, dropping to a low price of 14,300 yuan. Xianghe, Mingfeng, and Chengji entered forcefully, slightly raising the price, closing at 14,430 yuan, which was 370 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day, with a difference of 1,100 yuan. The retail price of gold from the cash shops was 14,600 yuan, with the purchase price about 1,000 yuan lower than the selling price.</p>
<p>Jewelry falls 50 yuan</p>
<p>The exchange price of jewelry gold per tael opened at 50 yuan higher in the morning, at 1,570 yuan, but then suddenly fell three times, lowering the price by 100 yuan, finally reaching 1,470 yuan (the purchase price was reduced by 150 yuan), down by 50 yuan. The price of silver remained at 22 yuan, and the black market price was 17 yuan, with a transaction volume of 500 to 600 taels.</p>
<h3>Chinese Merchants Bullish on Black Market Foreign Exchange: Unwilling to Supply Unless at High Prices, British Gold Notes Suddenly Plummet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the central bank and HSBC posting prices as before, and the prices at the smaller counters of HSBC, etc., were also flat. The black market for British and American exchange continued to soften. Although importing foreign firms rarely made purchases, sellers had disappeared due to the soaring spot prices the day before. Chinese merchants were only willing to supply at bullish prices, asking for 2.375 yuan for British exchange and 3.5 yuan for US dollars. No transactions were made throughout the day. The price was 0.0625 yuan tighter than the previous British exchange and 0.125 yuan tighter than the previous US dollar.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds fall, with spot prices falling by 10 yuan each. British gold notes suddenly plummeted, retreating to 60 yuan in the evening market. US gold notes were high at 29 yuan in the morning, with a final price of 28.5 yuan, up 2 jiao from the previous day. Hong Kong notes also tended to soften, retreating to 6.4 yuan in the evening market. Japanese gold notes and military notes also declined, with the former retreating to 2.8 yuan and the latter falling to 3.46 yuan.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 2nd (Tuesday) Telegram: The foreign exchange market opened calmly this morning, with all exchanges showing no gains or losses.</p>
<p>Tianjin, 2nd (Tuesday) Telegram: The foreign exchange market opened flat this morning, with no change in the London and New York telegraphic transfers. There were prices but no buyers. The Shanghai exchange also remained at its original level. The unofficial price of the Federal Reserve note fell by 2.5 jiao to 49.25 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Fluctuations Narrowing</h3>
<p>Factory cloth: The market initially rose seven times in the morning, but then immediately fell. This was because retail sales were sluggish, and factories and traders sold off at high prices. Yihua and Zhenzhong factories opened sales of rental cloth in various grades for recent contracts, making it difficult for cloth prices to rise. The fluctuations were even smaller in the afternoon. As a result, the prices rose or fell by 0.25 to 0.5 jiao compared to the previous day. Approximately 200 pieces of coarse cloth and flannel were traded on this street, and Zhejiang dealers handled 50 to 60 pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth.</p>
<p>Dong cloth: The market initially rose and then fell, with the range of increases and decreases gradually narrowing. Therefore, the market trend turned stable. The opening price of the exchange's colored ball fine cloth futures rose by 5 jiao, but then fell following the decline in yarn prices. The closing price for this month was 85 yuan, down by 1.5 yuan. January was at 88 yuan, and February was at 89.5 yuan, both down by 1 yuan. The closing price for leading fine cloth factory orders was 90 yuan, down by 2 yuan. The closing price for Four Gentlemen serge was 3.3 yuan, also down by 7 fen.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Returns Downward</h3>
<p>Declines range from 12 yuan to 4 yuan. Yesterday, the sugar market weakened due to the seemingly eased US-Japan situation. The bullish mood of the previous market was fleeting, and trading was quiet. The total number of contracts traded was only about 6,000 bags, and spot goods were only about 5,000 bags. For example, the futures contract for 24 coarse white sugar companies opened at 206 yuan to 202 yuan in the morning, but fell below the 200 yuan mark in the afternoon, to 197 yuan to 199 yuan, down by 8.5 yuan from the previous market. The 20th contract was at 212 yuan to 211 yuan in the morning and 206.5 yuan in the afternoon, returning to a high of 9 yuan. As a result, it fell slightly by 9 yuan. The import of spot goods in November was 214 yuan to 208.5 yuan in the morning.</p>
<h3>Bean Oil: Mixed</h3>
<p>Yesterday's miscellaneous grains market was mixed. The price of cooking oil rose by around 10 yuan due to the reduction in inventory and the bullishness of the cargo owners. Soybeans continued to rise by 2-3 yuan due to the continuous appetite of customers from other regions. Corn initially firmed due to the efforts of customers from other regions, but then declined as profit-taking hoarders dumped their holdings, resulting in a decline of 1-2 yuan compared to the previous day. Sales opened for 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 300 cans of Jiangbei raw oil, over 100 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 800 dan of Dayou factory clear oil, over 200 barrels of Rihua factory vegetable oil, 400 bags of Tianjin Xinjinyuan, and 200 bags of green beans. There were over 2,000 bags of spot corn, and 700 tons from Yinghua Company.</p>

<h3>Dealing with Housing Disputes</h3>
<p>— Ping Ye</p>
<p>The efforts of the concession authorities to stabilize the prices of daily necessities have been successful, and we believe that they are also considering the issue of housing for citizens. Yesterday's newspaper reported that the concession authorities had studied the rent issue, but the proposed solutions involved legal matters, making progress difficult. However, we believe that this does not mean that they are unable to stop the exorbitant rent increases. Laws are based on human considerations, and price increases that go beyond human considerations and threaten the housing security of citizens also affect public safety. Therefore, our opinion is to be lenient with the past and strict with the future. As long as they can establish a method that balances emotions and reality, they can at least stabilize the soaring rental prices.</p>
<p>We believe that to solve the pressure of rent increases that most common people suffer from, the following short-term measures can be taken: (1) After the measures are announced, all rental contracts signed by second landlords and third tenants shall remain as they were. After that, if a second landlord needs to increase the rent, they must report the reasons for the increase (such as increased water fees or property taxes) to the relevant department of the concession authorities. After review and confirmation that the reasons are valid, the rent may be appropriately increased. The same applies if the landlord requests a rent increase when the rental contract expires and is renewed. The landlord must not secretly contact a third party to replace the tenant. If the second landlord claims that they are taking back the property for their own use, they must also report the reasons and await review. If the rental contract has not expired, the landlord must not claim that they are taking back the property for their own use, requesting the tenant to move out, unless otherwise stipulated in the contract. (2) In the case of selling subdivided housing, even if the landlord changes, the original tenants cannot be changed, and the rent cannot be increased. The name of the landlord in the contract can be changed, but the wording of the original contract cannot be changed. (3) Hereafter, when a landlord rents out a house, they must not collect any fees under the name of small rent or other similar names. Tenants may voluntarily pay a small amount of repair fees, but it should not exceed a few yuan per room. (4) If a tenant requests to continue renting one month before the expiration of the contract, they may continue to rent at the original rent. (5) Those who violate various regulations shall be fined. Those who extort tips or order tenants to move out shall be severely punished.</p>
<p>We have received letters from all walks of life appealing for the issue of rent, almost like a mountain. At the same time, some people have sent letters advocating a compromise solution, so that the second landlords do not leave the houses empty without renting them out, or sublet them to relatives and friends, leaving those who have no relatives almost without a place to stay. In fact, as long as there is a fair solution for extortion of tips or forced relocation, the housing problem will not become thorny. We are convinced that the concession authorities have been able to establish a good atmosphere in the difficult work of stabilizing the prices of daily necessities. This housing problem, which seems complicated but is actually simpler than the issue of daily necessities, will surely be successfully resolved by the concession authorities in a reasonable amount of time. This is what we can say with certainty.</p>
<h3>Housing and Living · Moving and Rent Increases</h3>
<p>— Fang Yang</p>
<p>The landlord’s son said he was getting married next month. The landlady came to discuss, saying, "Move back to your own place a month early, so you can find a new one!" The words were as pleasant as could be. But finding a south-facing unit for forty-five dollars a month? Where would one find that?</p>
<p>In fact, the rent I pay monthly already covers the entire expenses of the landlord's house. They live in the entire lower level for free, and also earn thirty-six dollars from the three-story building and twenty-two dollars from the attic room. Yet, they are already calculating on my head, an "old tenant"—the son's marriage is a pretense, but wanting me to move is the truth.</p>
<p>Moreover, I heard that once the old tenant leaves, they can collect a small "key money" or deposit of one or two thousand dollars from the new tenant.</p>
<p>In the end, someone was sent to tell me they would give me three months' "moving expenses." However, we have decided this:</p>
<p>"Everyone go out and find a place. As long as the conditions (including rent, accessibility, etc.) are suitable, ask the landlord to help us move to the new place, and that's it. As for myself, I absolutely will not take a single copper."</p>
<p>Thus began my "house-hunting" life. —Seeing the landlady's lifeless face every day is truly boring. I decided to go out and see what the outside "housing market" is really like.</p>
<p>I ran around to quite a few places, but was rejected because of these conditions:</p>
<p>"How many people are there in your family? We don't rent to families with children!" I told them there were three of us, and they almost shook their heads off. They repeatedly said, "No rent, no rent!"</p>
<p>This really baffled me. Isn't the country "encouraging childbirth"? Isn't China boasting to the world about its large population? But why are the landlords in Shanghai opposing people "having children"? Are they afraid that others' children will snatch away their "property," and hope that people will "die childless and without descendants"?</p>
<p>That's one reason, but many others scared me away with conditions like thousands of dollars in "key money," several months' deposit, and paying five years' rent in advance.</p>
<p>So, I have no choice but to stay in that house, enduring the landlord's anger. Moreover, I have been enduring "scolding the daughter to teach the daughter-in-law" every day for two months, and still haven't found a new place! (Their son's "wedding" had to be postponed.)</p>
<p>I don't understand any of this. The price of goods in the Seven Seas can be controlled, so why are the landlords in Shanghai still allowed to be so arrogant today?</p>
<h3>Collection of Profound Opinions</h3>
<p>— Compiled by University Students</p>
<p>Some university professors in Shanghai, in addition to lecturing, routinely love to utter profound opinions, covering everything from the vastness of the universe to the minutiae of flies. Now, let us record a few examples below to amuse the readers.</p>
<p>The Leapfrog Theory</p>
<p>According to a certain professor, it is fortunate that China's railway and highway transportation are not well-developed, because the most convenient means of transportation today is the airplane; railways and highways are outdated. The United States has railways and highways crisscrossing the country, which are almost useless. China can skip the railway and highway stage and directly utilize airplanes. In fact, we can wait another eighteen hundred years. If humanity does not perish and progress does not stop, there will surely be more convenient means of transportation than airplanes in the future. Wouldn't we be able to leap even further if we wait a few hundred years, or even a few thousand years? What do you think, Professor?</p>
<p>A Profound Lesson</p>
<p>Since one is a professor, one must have "gilded" oneself; since one has gilded oneself, one must say, "When I was in the United States..." And the most profound lesson that our great professor learned when he was in the United States was the following:</p>
<p>When our great professor was about to return home, his foreign teacher gave him this famous saying: "You can take anything back with you, but by no means take American machines with you; the United States has suffered from machines, and your Eastern spiritual civilization is great." If this foreign teacher knew how diligently his student was spreading his famous saying, he would surely say with joy, "This child is teachable." If Ah Q were executed by shooting, he could also smile in the afterlife; if he were resurrected again, he would say, "My doctrine is not isolated."</p>
<h3>Revitalizing Business Ethics</h3>
<p>— Jing Cun</p>
<p>Before the war, the business community in Shanghai had made efforts to advocate for the cultivation and training of employees. At that time, I knew that many companies and shops ran their own training classes or subsidized employees' supplementary schools. Since the outbreak of war, industry and commerce have been hit hardest, and the work of training employees has also been suspended. After the war moved inland and the population concentrated in Shanghai, various industries showed a booming atmosphere again. Although business is booming, the service ethics of commercial employees seem to be less satisfactory than before the war. This is really something that the business community must pay attention to. Recently, I had the opportunity to visit the He Ming shoe store and had several in-depth conversations with its owner. I feel that the training of his employees is truly admirable.</p>
<p>In general shoe stores in Shanghai, the clerks are mostly apprentices. He Ming recruits middle school students and then provides them with vocational training. Therefore, they treat customers with courtesy and kindness, giving people a good impression. After work every day, the manager leads them in various extracurricular activities, such as knowledge lectures on Mondays, family worship on Wednesdays, and ball games on Fridays. They also invite celebrities to give lectures from time to time to instill the knowledge necessary for young people. It is also said that a business youth association will soon be established to provide employees with full training in moral, intellectual, physical, and social development. All extracurricular organizations or activities of the store are attended unanimously, without distinction between managers and employees. Therefore, they are usually harmonious, advising each other well and correcting each other's faults. Among the industrial and commercial firms I know well, He Ming is one that I consider to have the most promising future.</p>
<p>It is really necessary to revitalize business ethics in Shanghai after the war, especially today. Aside from "making money," the business community does not talk about service. For example, the repeated price increases cannot be said to be necessary. Everyone raises prices in a frenzy, but as far as I know, He Ming's prices are raised later than others. If everyone did that, prices would not rise like a runaway horse.</p>

<h3>Chinese Flowering Crabapple</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Fifteen. Father, let's go busking!</p>
<p>"When will this situation improve?" Mei Bao asked, looking up at the face of this great editor, her brows furrowed with worry.</p>
<p>Qian Ruomo hesitated for a full four or five minutes before answering.</p>
<p>"It's hard to say." He exhaled a mouthful of smoke, tilted his head, and looked at the overcast sky. "Before the dawn, everyone can only endure some suffering!"</p>
<p>Mei Bao already understood the situation in Shanghai in recent days, but she didn't know how serious it was until she saw Qian Ruomo's expression at this moment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this situation became more serious day by day. By the time Qiu Haitang recovered from his illness and got out of bed, Shanghai had become another world. Qian Ruomo had left, and before leaving, he sent them fifty dollars and a short note, stating that he was leaving Shanghai to go to Sichuan due to his job, and hoping that Mei Bao and her father could also slowly find a way to go to the southwest.</p>
<p>Zhang Yincai also came several times, and told Qiu Haitang that he had transferred to the newly opened Rong Stage to be in charge of martial arts. As long as Qiu Haitang's voice was good enough, he could help him get a role as an old male character.</p>
<p>But this time, Mei Bao didn't want to let her father go out and sell his old bones anymore. (278)</p>

<p>Entertainment World</p>
<h3>Greer Garson's Reason for Acting as a Mother with a Loving Heart</h3>
<p>— Yi Fan</p>
<p>"Mrs. Miniver," currently showing at the Grand China Theater, marks Greer Garson's first appearance in a color film. In "Mrs. Miniver," she plays the superintendent of a Texas orphanage, showing her loving heart for children. Before Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer produced this film, they spent some time choosing the leading role, and eventually found that Miss Garson was the only suitable actress in Hollywood.</p>
<p>This blonde, blue-eyed Irish woman knew that playing this role would not be easy, but she decided to take it on and work for the happiness of children around the world. As for why she was chosen and suitable for the leading role in "Mrs. Miniver," there is also a reason.</p>
<p>Like other Irish people, Greer Garson entered school at a young age. But from elementary school to graduation from the University of London, she relied on scholarships to advance through these three stages. Of course, after graduation, she became a teacher, fulfilling her responsibility for education. Soon, she was introduced to a research institute by an advertising company in London. Later, she was introduced to a music academy in Birmingham. The first play she performed was Shaw's famous work, and from then on, she decided to dedicate herself to entertainment. Her famous work was the film "Golden Arrow."</p>
<p>After acting in the film "Goodbye, Mr. Chips," she was introduced to Hollywood to develop her career. Her first film in the United States was "Blossoms in the Dust," which received praise from the education community. She co-starred with Ronald Colman in Remember. She was also the leading actress in "Pride and Prejudice." Now she appears in the color film "Mrs. Miniver," playing the lover of two thousand children. With the influence she received in her childhood and the experience she gained in education after graduation, her success can be imagined. After seeing it, people in Shanghai may have a little "loving heart for children."</p>
<h3>The First Day a New Actor Takes the Stage</h3>
<p>— Zhi Yu</p>
<p>Li Shaochun has returned from gilding himself in Peking and made a grand debut at the Tianchan. The opening day's performance was "Striking the Drum and Scolding Cao Cao" and "Two Generals," one civil and one military. The plays were so brand-new! When I arrived, Li Peifang was singing "June Snow," followed by Ban Shichao's "Peach Blossom Festival," a big fight, which was not weak compared to Yan Shishan. Xiaba Bai Yuanjie, a young lad who looked to be about ten years old, was quite good! Because it was the first day, he put in extra effort. Zhang Haichen's "Taking Luoyang" was average. Then came Bai Yuwei's "Spring Boudoir." As soon as Bai Yuwei appeared, she charmed the whole house. Her makeup was as beautiful as her name. Her expression was quite realistic, probably because a young girl was playing a young girl. The pity is that her voice is not bright, so many good tunes can only be enjoyed by the audience in the front row.</p>
<p>Li Shaochun's "Scolding Cao Cao" took the stage. His opening line was full of charm. A voice filled the hall, "A lifetime of ambition..." Every line of the singing was enjoyable. The sound of the drum, using the phrase "big pearls and small pearls falling on a jade plate" to describe it, would not be an exaggeration. Adding to that the clear and vigorous "Midnight Song," ah! Too beautiful. A few lines of Er Liu were also quite proper, but his voice is a bit worse than Yang Baosen, and his face has more acting than Baosen. "Two Generals," I think, is the most powerful show. Li Shaochun comes from a martial arts background. In "The Extraordinary Hero in Red Robe," he was already very famous. So his martial arts skills are really not bad. That leg stood independently for three minutes. Then came three somersaults. He can also sing - in "Two Generals" that I have seen, that General Ma always sings in a "hoarse" voice. Although Zhi Yu tried hard to shout, he couldn't make a sound. - Worthy of being a "civil and military talent." Mao Qinglai really put in hard work. No wonder the Li brothers-in-law both wanted to grab him.</p>
<p>Finally, one should mention Li Baokui's Liu Bei. Don't look down on him for being a secondary role. His singing and acting are much better than the "neither fish nor fowl" leading actor. The expressions of "surprise," "joy," "anxiety," and "resentment" when watching the battle from the city really brought Liu Bei to life at that time. It was really enjoyable to watch!</p>
<h3>A Rehearsal Record of You You Troupe</h3>
<p>The You You Troupe rehearsed at the Ningbo Association yesterday. Each of the dramas performed was extremely wonderful, but Mr. Zhou Dongshan's "Teaching his Son, Wang Chune" was even more rare. His opening citation and recitation won thunderous applause. The big paragraph of Er Huang in the machinery room was sung sweetly and clearly, like pearls falling on a jade plate. Old Xue Bao...'s clapper was even more masterful. Other aspects, such as the stage style, the beauty of the makeup, and the generosity of the stage steps, were rare in the amateur world. The entire play was extremely wonderful. The drama was also played by the famous amateur musicians Zhou Dongming and Li Shishan, which added icing to the cake. The flamboyance of the large interlude was no less than that of Lan Yuanshaoqing. Famous amateurs Sun Minhou, Shen Jinling, Miss Zhou Ping and the renowned amateur performer Cheng Junke all praised it.</p>
<h3>Jade Shattered, Pearl Rounded Filming Completed</h3>
<p>The filming of the Venus Film Company's "Jade Shattered, Pearl Rounded" was completed yesterday after two months of work. The film was directed by Zheng Xiaoqiu, and the results of the film are better than "Peach Blossom Lake."</p>
<p>Also, following "Jade Shattered, Pearl Rounded," Venus has internally decided on Zhang Shichuan's "Red Tears Shadow," and the complete list of actors is being considered these days.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Education Hall on Hualong Road recently organized a "Peking Opera Research Society." It teaches for two hours every day from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM. The famous actress Wu Jilan is specially hired to serve as the instructor. The monthly fee is one dollar. All women who are interested in Peking Opera, regardless of whether they have studied it or not, can sign up to join.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 19: Yellow Turbans and Hu Cavalry Fill the City</p>
<p>Liu Yinyin also wore a white undershirt, revealing two snowy white arms, and reached out to untie the bindings on his legs. He rolled up his trousers, revealing thighs as fair as jade lotus roots. Shi saw that there was a small hole in the wound, not yet healed, with some slight blood flowing out, and some congealed bloodstains nearby. Xu Jing then used cotton to soak in warm water, and gently wiped away the blood stains for Liu Yinyin, dried it, and then went to get the medicinal powder, sprinkled it on the wound, covering the wound completely, took a small piece of oil paper, and put it over the wound, and then stroked it once outside the oil paper, meaning to make the oil paper flatter. Unexpectedly, when his hand touched Liu Yinyin's thigh, Liu Yinyin couldn't help but feel a little itchy, and giggled, shrinking his thigh and saying, "Thank you, I'll tie it up myself." Xu Jing then retracted his hands and stood in front of the bed, watching Liu Yinyin put down his trousers and slowly tie them up. As soon as he had tied them, but because Liu Yinyin's upper body was leaning forward too much, the corner of the cotton quilt covering his body suddenly slipped down. Liu Yinyin didn't realize it at first, but later he raised his head and saw Xu Jing's eyes staring at him without letting go, and then he realized that a button on his small shirt was not buttoned up, and was loose, revealing his snowy white neck and a corner of his chest. His face turned red, and he quickly pulled up the cotton quilt, covered his body, and lay down. When Xu Jing saw his appearance, a cloud of suspicion arose. He thought to himself that Liu Yinyin's skin was so white and smooth, like ice and jade, and resembled that of a girl. Seeing me, he is always shy and hesitant, isn't it ridiculous? If he is not a girl, why would he be like this? (234)</p>
