<p>路透社二一九日仰光電　東京廣播謂、蔣委員長已派華軍入緬防術滇緬公路、此說殊爲荒誕、聞者咸以爲異、以緬甸諺言相喻、謂牛皮中不能藏象、</p>

<p>哈瓦斯社二十九日重慶電　美國海軍日羅斯福總統及海長諾克斯等之演說、雖未造成一種新的局面、但美國不惜任何代價、以爭取海洋自由之重大決心、又經一度鄭重表白、此乃此間一般印象、大公報稱，一般觀察謂、美總統此次演說、事實上等於對德宣戰、實非過言、美總統又指出德國對南美之陰謀、考之軸心國在南美之勢力，實使美國發生恐懼心理、從而憎惡希特勒與同期英國、故美國之遲早必將參加大西洋戰爭、已是註定的命運在此緊張情勢之下、日本自有在遠東滋事之可能、以與其盟國策應、故美國對日應特別戒備、中央日報於譽揚美總統等之演說後、亦謂美國爲使物資安全運至民治國家計、必將調用其強大海軍、但此時不可忘卻納粹之遠東伙伴、方在軍人內閣領導之下、加強其侵略行動、倘不先予徹底解決、則反噬堪處、故美國至少應歐亞並重、兩洋兼顧、否則遠東局勢、難免有重大變動、使　國不能以全力摧毁希特勒主義、其所影響於戰局前途、誠　淺鮮云、</p>
<h3>美國評論</h3>
<p>路透社二十九日華盛頓電　昨聆羅斯福總統演詞者、僅美國一國估計、共達五千萬人、國會方面毁　不一、民主黨參議員希爾稱、此演詞及時而發、有國家領袖之風度、而孤立派參議員章勒則謂、總統顯將認中立法之取消爲國會准其進行射擊戰爭之證、總統秘書歐萊告新聞記者、演詞發表後、發電話與電報前來陳述意見者極多、致白宮電話綫與電報綫不暇應接、計白宮所接意見、以八對一贊成此演詞、</p>
<p>合衆社二十九日華盛頓電弗羅里達民主黨參議員派潑氏昨稱、欲擊敗德國、非「集合最優軍力」、向致命處打擊不可、　敦促美國響應羅斯福總統之呼聲、「自搖船櫓」、派潑氏索有政府發言人之謂、渠敦促將中立法予以修改、又稱、一九三九年春、羅斯福總統曾要求將軍　禁運案予以廢止、惟國會未予允許、此舉使希特勒能爲所欲爲、終於進攻波蘭及法國、派潑參議員稱、納粹之行動爲被人估價過低之「弹性之叛變勢力」又言、希特勒決不肯讓步、寧願在死亡流徙或統治世界中擇一途徑云、</p>
<p>咯瓦斯社　十九日華盛頓電羅斯福總統在海軍節所發表之演說、頃由此間政界人士加以批評、略謂、此項演說、幾與宣戰無異、蓋美國實際上已對德作戰、不過法理上尚未經國會正式宣佈而已、</p>

<h3>倫敦興奮</h3>
<p>合衆社二十九日倫敦電政府界昨對羅斯福總統之海軍節演說、至感興奮、惟平民則微感失望、因美國並無新行動、足以符合總統之戰爭性言論也、夜星報撰評云、該演詞表示、不久將來、美國軍艦及商輪、將在吾人口岸中出現、演詞明告希特勒、德國艦隊總司令雷德特級上將及全世界謂、美國準備以射擊姿態橫渡大西洋、無論至英國或至美國、美國現正以緩慢而肯定之態度、進入戰爭、消息報則撰橫貫全頁之鉅大標題云、美國站於戰爭崗位、又撰評稱、羅斯福總統已唤起民衆、對不可避免之事實、作進一步之行動、</p>
<p>路透社一十九日倫敦電星報評論羅斯福總統之漢軍日廣播稱、希特勒盼望美總統談及日本、引開美總統到渠之注意、此乃希特勒所愛用的閃避方法之一、然美總統不爲所　、演詞中絕未提及日本、蓋不欲從主要目標移開其目光也、東條之虛張聲勢、絲毫未使羅斯福總統分散其主敵、而集中之注意力云、</p>
<h3>德方憤恨</h3>
<p>路透社二十九日倫敦電柏林官塲對羅斯福總統海軍日演說而發之評論、列爲暴烈、其憤怒之情、溢於言表、德方無綫電臺對國民廣播、斥羅斯福氏爲卑鄙的操賤役之人舆「國際間猶太人掌握中之可哂的傀儡」、並謂其演詞「鄙劣已極」、</p>
<p>海通社　一十九日柏林電柏林方面認羅斯福總統演說所稱、德國征服南美、廢止基督教及其他信條之陰謀、純爲宣傳之談、極荒謬而愚蠢、德國官方認爲無加否認之價值、羅斯福氏之演說、爲猶太偽造工廠之標準產品、無加重視之必要、渠所稱發現文件證明德國欲自設國教、廢止現行之各種宗教信條云云、據柏林方面稱、在上月初在德國北部即獲自天空擲下之小冊、内容與羅斯福氏所言如出一轍、此或係英·美宣傳機關之合作欠周、致英方所預備之小冊、在時機未熟時先行擲下、至於德方所製地圖、表明南美新秩序之範圍一層，德外部發言人稱、此或係德報所刊表明英國在南美之空軍根據地之地圖、所謂德國欲廢止一切宗教、大概爲羅斯福氏欲驚嚇南美、並煽動全世界之教會反德、羅斯福氏對於美人之智力顯然無深切之認識、以爲美人易欺可以使其實現其外交政治之目的、羅斯福之演說、舆前此美國主戰派之狂吼相同、鏤銘猶太虛僞之印記、美人對於羅斯福之觀點及方法決不致同意、羅斯福强欲牽美人於戰渦、此種猶太人之自私政策、待美國自下其判決可也、</p>
<h3>日報表示不滿</h3>
<p>合衆社二十九日東京電東京日文報紙、本日一致攻擊羅斯福總統所言美國將繼續援助重慶、日日新聞稱、此項援助將無效力、報知新聞謂、羅斯福總統之未提及遠東問題、並無重要、因美國在太平洋上反對日本、猶如其反對德國之目標係與日本之目標相同云、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>羅斯福演說與遠東</h3>
<p>在今日業已牽入戰爭漩渦的各國以外，美國是唯一恰站在戰爭分水嶺上的國家。從法理方面看來，中立法的修改或廢除，至今仍在美國會斷斷爭論之中，換句話說，也就是直釗現在美國尙未能擺脫中立法案的覊絆，自然一時還談不到參戰；但在實際行動上、除卻為中立法案條文所拘束的範圍以外，有如對於中英蘇聯的支援，對侵略國家的嚴厲斥責和斷然措施，射擊軸心船隻的命令，護航與武裝商船的前後實行，都表示着美國早已從事於反侵略戰爭。惟其因為美國是採取着這樣一種類似矛盾的奇特姿態，以是就引起了種種，猜測和幻想，或則懷疑美當局是否對於某一些侵略者還存有綏靖的用心，或則　圖切把戰爭擴大到西半球恫嚇美國止步。然而時至最近，事實業已判明：即使美國還不至立時參戰，至低限度亦已叫白宣示其誓將侵略者澈底摧毀的決心，在軍事方面也完成了必要的應變準備，無論來日局勢如何演變，此一基調，只有愈趨積極和尖銳化，絕無動搖可能，羅斯福總統廿七日在海軍節發表演說，於此更提供了强有力保證。</p>
<p>羅氏在這一演說中，揭穿納粹陰謀，嚴斥侵略罪惡，與其年來若干其他的動人辭令如出一轍而其安詳與樂觀則為向來所罕見。他指出以美國軍火運抵友國，乃美國全國的意志，今雖陸續發生船隻被沉船員遭害的不幸，卻絕不足以阻撓美國使其放棄初衷，並決由武裝商輪修改中立法案以為答覆；他明言納粹的前淮能加制止並將被制止，相信美國所負担的工作不敢失敗亦不致失敗；他更嚴斥失敗主義者的見解，認為美國憑藉其偉大天賦與歷史傳統，已有充分準備以應付最新最偉大的挑戰。縱觀全部演詞大意，雖然他仍只以製造更多軍火以供給中英蘇聯為美國的最大工作，但他却絕不畏怯或閃避戰爭，假使侵略者再作進一步的煎迫，其所得到的決不是嚇退美國而是美國的堅決應戰。</p>
<p>但是另一方面，羅氏此次演說，適與其前此若干文告相同，並未明顯提及遠東和日本，這也許又引起一些懷疑或幻想，其實，美國對於遠東的態度和動向，是決不能從這一點事態去窺見其涯際的。羅斯福的演說有多時不曾明顯提到遠東，美日間的談判也斷斷續續直到現在，這都是事實；不過美當局也從未因此而鬆弛對遠東應變的配備，恰在羅斯福發表海軍日紀念的同時，美國任命了第一任的遠東空軍司令、並且傳聞美亞洲艦隊已駛抵新加坡，無寗到是這些實際措施更具有左右遠東大局的力量。本月二十四日美海長諾克斯對海軍軍火製造商發言，表示日本如不放棄其擴展計畫則遠東衝突勢不可免，連日日方朝野因此頗兒悸動，吾人相信此絕非諾克斯個人的見解，因為根據美當局一貫立塲，也正可以得到相同的結論。此度羅氏演說，日本雖未被提到，但却一再涉及中國，他把以軍火供給中英蘇聯視為美國最重大的工作，並且表示對此工作的實行不敢失敗亦不致失敗，這也就是暗示美國必須貫澈其以軍火供給中國的任務，不因任何阻撓或困難而中輟，這已經表明了美國對遠東的堅決立塲以及美國在對日進行談判中不容涉及的限度。</p>
<p>美國一向對於遠東具有絕大關懷，其對於間的一切相信必能比較任何其他西力列強更要明瞭，是以世人實不必躭心美國在此等問題上受人蒙蔽或欺罔。美國自已不願挑動戰爭，這無論在西方抑在遠東都是一樣；現在納粹已公然對美挑釁，美國則以摧毀納粹主義相答覆，而日本刻仍對，國尋覓妥協的途徑，故美方亦即避免若干不必要的刺激。至於美國基本國策，建立在反對侵略觀點上面，絕不致因國際間一時利害關係而有所重輕或轉移。其對於中日戰事的熊度，已於若干對日措施允其是對華實施租借法案當中充分表現，倘使遠東變亂再超出中日戰事範圍之外，則美力當必立即更進一步的斷然反斷應。以言主動運用，於此或稍嫌小足，至於應變戢亂，則美國早有充分準備與決心，實無所用其憂疑。</p>

<h3>運用抑平物價技術　組織進口商協會卅五家商行昨參與會議　所持政策與工部局一致昨晚局會後籌備實施管理零售方法</h3>
<p>公共租界工部局鑒於抑止物價高漲、必須獲得大進口商家之合作、乃於昨日下午二時、假該局會議室召集海上進口洋行三十五家之代表、舉行空前未有之會議、計劃成立一進口商協會、促成工部局管理物價計劃之有效實施、至昨日會議之決定、當於下星期初、由工部局發表之、查工部局管理物價之計劃、最初由總辦費利溥口頭發表、繼於上星期一公佈正式文吿、並擬定新附則一條、呈請領事團核准、雖該附則迄今尙在領團考慮之中、但工部局統制物價之決心、已彰彰明甚、向平準會請求供給麵麥進口所需之外滙在光、而美董明思德保證民食無虞恐慌之事在後、今不旋踵而籌謀組織進口商協會、顯見更具有特殊之意義、</p>
<p>協會細則　殆已決定</p>
<p>工部局為採取前所未有之指置、防抑物品零售價格之反常高漲、乃於昨日下午、為本埠重要外國進口商及製造商三十五家之負責人士、擇行會議、旨在組織一進口商協會、該會議始自下午二時一刻、地在工部局會議室、如愛蘭漢百利有限公司（英商、漢口路一一〇號、專營藥品化學品及醫院用具之進口）天祥洋行（英商、廣東路十七號、各種進出口業）海寗洋行、（美商、製造白脫糖果及其他食品）及德康洋行、（英商、四川路三三號、）等各進口商行、均派代表參加、據參加該會之一進口洋行職員宣稱、工部局在未與進口商會議以前、已舉行多决會議、而計劃組織進口商聯合區制物價高漲、猶以此為嘴失、據稱、上星期間、工部局業已分發柬帖、給三十五家外國進口行家及製造廠商、請參加此一會議、至進口商協會之成立細則、昨日下午會議中、殆已決定、</p>
<p>管理零售　疏通來源</p>
<p>據稱、組織協會之全部細則、可望於日內整理淸楚、昨日會議究有何種決議案、當於下周初由工部局發表之、據稱進口商協會之政策、將與上星期一工部局所發之文吿相一致、蓋工部局聲稱、無意干涉正常之商業貿易、吾則必需品將自滬流出、但對於零售價格、必予管理、又據另一方面透露、進口商行昨日之會議、討論之要目有二、其一爲切實管理本市物價、取締不合理之物價昇漲、二為對於各項必需品之來源、加以疏通、而由工部局委托可恃之外商進口商從事採購輸入、一如食米辦法、由工部局供給平價發售、</p>
<p>昨日局會　籌備實行</p>
<p>領團對工部局要求之新附則、現時雖尙米批准、但工部局對組織合法機關、起草各種章程、早已積極進行、昨日下午四時三十分、該局舉行例會時、對一般問題、會提出檢討、庶幾於地皮章程附則被批准時、即能公布辦法、實施管理物價、至工部局所擬直接辦理運銷者、為麵粉·煤球·與食油、均在次第進行中、煤球評價委員會自成立以還、近將兩週、議決結果、煤球每市担（一一〇磅）、一律於二十八日起售國幣十九元、送力在內、各零售商店務須一體遵行、茲悉煤柴炭號業聯合會已於日前接到該會正式通知、並卽轉知全體同業遵行在案、該會對於籌製「標準煤球」一事、甫在積極進行中、但據探悉、此種煤球、該會並非自行製造、仍係交諸各煤球商集資籌劃製造、該會將來僅處指導地位、茲各該煤球商已將製球成分、及方法、列表送請該會、再由該會送請工部局研究、待工部局認可後、即開始製造、在市上發售、屆時每担售價、將較共他各種煤球為低廉、</p>
<p>滬市經濟　有待設計</p>
<p>昨日出版之英文金融商業周報、撰文論述上海物價高漲之情形、又力促工部局從速根據所擬定之新附則、與進口商合作、竭力草成一計劃、使上海經濟建築於戰時基礎之上、平準基余委員會、由於其金融之作用、固能限制進口、但絕不能統制物價、工部局若能與進口商協力合作、當能管理物價、亦能於萬難中、採用新制度、將供給品分配於商人、若商人不遵照定章辦埋、以後即斷絕將物料供給、以至使之不能繼續營業、在維持中國法幣之大原則下、平準基金會對於此事、必將熱忱襄助、殆無疑義、</p>
<h3>管理米價欲期有效　端在公衆合作勿預購過多致妨害供給　下月用米已有充分準備</h3>
<p>工部局美籍董事明思德博士、於前日招待記者、聲明工部局洋米來源不致中斷後、將連日米市塲上所散播洋米來源有限制之說、一掃而空、致投機份子、已無法使其技倆、昨日各檔米價、均下跌五六元、同時一般居民、經當局佈吿後、購儲之風亦已大减、昨日兩租界內多數米號復以獲有工部局洋米、故已恢復門市、惟購米者人數仍甚擁擠、</p>
<p>實銷充裕</p>
<p>據記者探悉、昨日一日間、祥茂洋行發給各米號之工部局洋米，總數達七千餘包、此數足供全市各米號之實銷、據米號業方面意見、自當局暫時停止南市閘北滬西等處米號批購工部局洋米後、致各該等處之米價、更較租界區內為高、遂致一般小販競至租界區內各米號購買、以圖獲利、若輩每人每次所購數量、雖僅二左右、但足使租界區內居民購買工部局洋米、發生困難、故甚望當局、能予制止、</p>
<p>足供消費</p>
<p>據工部局董事明思德博士昨稱、按照規定價格出售之洋米、其存底如僅供市民現時消費、則當局對於處置米市、頗能應付裕如、據稱、如公衆購米、非為轉售圖利、或供儲藏、並能按照工部局規定、不預購超過一個月需要之糧食、則對於當局所施行之管理米價辦法、可大受助益、而民食前途、亦決不致虞匱乏、又稱、十一月份可保證有大量之供給、故殊無恐慌之理由、最近工部局分配各米號出售之洋米、足供市民一星期之需要、且南市閘北居民、亦可包括在內、</p>
<p>供應原意</p>
<p>關於工部局洋米、最近由規定一百十七元價格在米市塲被漲至一百六十元之事、據明思德氏指稱、此係投機之結果、如市民購買超過需要之食米、及有人大量囤積、大批存米旣入囤積者之手、則米號存底、當然空虛、為制止米糧運出租界、在工部局方面、業已嚴令探捕注意、明氏又稱、在管理米價辦法之鏈索中、公衆之合作、實為最弱之一園、故深望市民能切實合作、舉發囤戶之投機漁利、使當局對違法者、能予以懲處、如公衆不能認識常局之管理辦法、又不能遵守工部局之規定、則供給進口洋米外滙之平準會、自必大感失望、又悉前日起、已有少數米號、接受當局勸吿、恢復發售平價港米、及公倉小絞米、但由工部局發給之紙牌仍未懸諸各該米號門首、</p>

<h3>兩處大火續誌兩運輸公司損失殊鉅　日商棉織廠亦遭焚如</h3>
<p>前日午後十二時五十分許，四川路四二三弄慈昌里大火、業已詳誌昨日本報、惟以延燒頗久、迨昨晨記者前往巡視時、猶有餘燼、茲續誌各情如次、四川路慈昌里建築甚為簡陋、共有四十餘戶、居民數百家、店號林立其間、全泰衆發兩運輸公司佔屋最多、在該弄十三號、門面計的有十餘間、內堆諸肥皂·蠟燭·鹹等各化學物品甚多、上層出租於各字號、不知如何、於前日午後、堆棧內突然火起、因所儲均易燃燒物質、致一發不可收拾、雖經十一輛救火車極力灌救、不能殺其勢、又延燒後弄之十二號·十四號·十六號·十八號·二十號·二十二號、二十四號·等戶、其中允以二十號老聚興菜飯館首當其衝、全部被燬殆盡、其餘亦敗屋頹垣不能居住、災戶頓失所居、一·時無從棲息、多在該處近弄席地暫居、厥狀甚爲凄慘、此次失火原因、一時眞相難明、損失約四百四五十萬之鉅、又前日虹口區內會發生大火、全體虹口區內之救火隊均一齊出動、以與大火相搏鬬、該大火係起於日人所設之茂豐（譯音）棉織廠、地點在昆明路七百五十號、損失於火中之棉花機器、價值八十萬元以上、直至昨（二十九）晨、救火人員猶未撇退、惟據悉至下午該棉織廠火燄業已全熄、此次大火延及地區、縱為一百七十五尺、橫為八十尺、屋頂亦被燒燬、救火時所用抽水器凡三、並由楊樹浦救火會協助、日海軍陸戰隊亦協助施救云、</p>

<h3>哈同遺產多方爭逐　複雜內幕已露綫索</h3>
<p>對簿公庭　勢將難免</p>
<p>（續昨）　於第二遺囑之檢出、亦頗饒興趣、羅氏於逝世前兩日、向其四子友起謂、銀箱中有重要物件一、當時並未言明為遺囑、而友起雖即將此物檢出、據稱亦未急於啓視、迨後始知為遺囑、據事案中人稱、當時羅氏嗣子嗣女等計劃於羅氏喪事斷七後、始將遺囑公布、後因賴埃德律師要求在十九日前答復、乃不得不提早宣布、以為佐證、據稱在羅氏華籍子女方面、認為第二遺囑乃眞正之遺囑、且各人均願遵照遺囑辦理、以若干地產捐贈公益機關、其餘則按遺囑分配、而不願見喬治憑籍賴埃德而對遺產有非法之操縱、鑒於目前事態、雙方對簿公庭、似極可能、惟據稱喬治仍有意雙方和解、息事寗人、不過因第一第二兩遺囑、大相逕庭、糾紛難免擴大、按喬治前因行為不檢、被羅迦陵驅逐後、遣至滬西平民習藝所習藝、戰後所務停頓、乃父遣至北乎、民二十八年、喬治自北平歸，經賴埃德律師之調解、始再回入愛儷園居住、查羅迦陵有華籍繼嗣八人、男五、女三、友蘭居長、外籍九人、除喬治對於遺產事煞費苦心外、其餘八人、態度據稱均極冷淡、</p>
<p>哈同洋行　業務停頓</p>
<p>由上所述、可知此一遺產糾粉今後之困難所在、一為兩張遺囑、孰是孰非、二為國籍問題、此案究由英按察使署承理、或由特一法院審理、據傾向於羅友蘭方面者聲稱、羅氏華籍子女認為各方對羅氏頗多誤解之處、希望第二遺囑能够實行、則公益機關不僅可以受惠、而羅氏事蹟亦可永垂不朽、至於姬覺彌及亞帕拉兩監護人、前此於賴埃德取去銀箱等時、適值猶太新年、未　顧問、而後者因哈同洋行卷宗等悉被封存、鑰匙亦被取去、故無公可辦、哈同洋行業已無形停頓、至此、可知此一糾紛中、雙方之陣綫、極為淸楚、</p>
<p>多方爭逐　前無成例</p>
<p>除上述以喬治及羅友蘭為首之兩種相對勢力外、尚有兩方面、對於羅氏八萬萬元之偌大遺產、亦欲染指、一為居住於伊拉克京城報達（哈同原籍）及此間之自稱為故哈同之近親者十人、耍求分析哈同遺產百分之六五·二、今亦已委托本埠英國律師瓊斯向英國按察使署提出警吿性之訴狀、意欲推翻羅迦陵之遺囑、查自稱為哈同近親之十人、向羅迦陵要求析產、其開端尙在羅氏逝世以前、其時該十人委托日籍律師岡本一乙、致函羅迦陵、要求析產、羅迦陵置之不復、羅氏死後、乃改請英籍律師瓊斯向英法庭提起訴訟、唯此一方面之糾粉、尙無進展、蓋檢定遺囑之訴訟、極為複雜、在上海乃至在英國、均無前例、</p>

<h3>徵文揭曉之八　腿</h3>
<p>— 方曉藍</p>
<p>—我得了一個敎訓—</p>
<p>每逢陰天雨天我的右腿就感到了一點輕微的不適。說痠不　痠，說痛更不是痛，就是有點不自然。這滋味眞不好受。請問幾時你曾記着自已有一條右腿呢？你做你的事，你走你的路，無論怎樣你也不會特別記得一條腿，但它却使我忘不了。</p>
<p>不過人總不能一直記着自己的一條腿呀！正如吃飯時你總不能一直記着自己的嘴一張一動。否則該是多蹩扭呢。</p>
<p>可是，腿，腿，我怎麼竟忘不了一條腿呢？</p>
<p>時間沿着記憶爬了回去，回到一個光榮的過去，一個帶王冕皇冠的過去。</p>
<p>那時人家都不叫我的名字，而叫球王。你該也知道，某個時期球王是多偉大的人物吧</p>
<p>球王自已是更知道他的偉大的，連夢中他也聽見歡呼載道，一片歌頌聲呢。環境培植了我的驕傲，驕傲平身又開花結果，繁生了更多的驕傲——也繁生了不幸。</p>
<p>是陽歴年假的時候吧。學校裏靜得連麻雀撲翅聲都聽得淸楚。百畝方圓祗有三五個人影。因為上海有家的人都回家了，沒家的也都過上海去玩去逛了。我因為着了凉，有點潮熱，所以躺在床上憇息，瞧着天花板想心思。連午飯都是在床上吃的。下午一點多鐘的時候，三樓的阿方下來撩天。</p>
<p>阿方也嗜球若在，所以我們是球兄球弟。那時他為了一點不如意事，（你知道年靑人總不免鬧點花呀月呀什麼的，因此也總不免有點不如意事，）把自已關在屋子裏，朝牆壁發脾氣。這半天想是脾氣發够了，便下來發牢騷了。</p>
<p>談了會兒，我提議去踢球，活動活動血脈，散散心。他說我有潮熱，還是躺躺吧。可是球王卻永遠不信有潮熱踢不得球。我跳下床，穿好鞋，抱了球就往外奔。拉起腳就踢，帶着球滿塲子跑，好不威風！樹上的烏兒也吱吱叫好呢。潮熱？我有什麼潮熱呢？</p>
<p>阿方也出來了。可是我成心耍他，一個花巧就把他丟在後面了。我繞着塲子盤球，他東攔西刦，但球王是會失風的嗎？</p>
<p>命運的手是殘酷的，它愛戲弄最最得意的人。就在那不巧的一秒鐘裏，我跌倒了。正確的說，我被球拌倒了，球王被球拌倒了。而且倒在地上站不起來了。</p>
<p>外科醫生來了，漆着紅十字的白色車子來了。我——球王被扛到担架上，抬進車中。因為說是右腿斷了。</p>
<p>躺在醫院的床上，望着天花板，我想了兩個月的心思：人總不能太任性，應該學習約束目已。</p>
<p>出了醫院，一切如常。不同的是在陰天雨天我總記着自已的一條腿。於是時間也就一次，二次……的，爬了回去，回到一個允榮的過去……</p>

<h3>「我亦鬼戀」</h3>
<p>— 金如墨</p>
<p>晚上若是睡不著，終不免胡思亂想，電燈一關，滿室漆黑，於是便有點恐怖，於是便想到鬼，於是父想到報上的鬼戲，還有能和鬼談戀愛，戲不曾去看，戀愛如何談法，皆不得而知，但是，念頭不正，就不免想到：設若有個鬼愛上了自已如何辦法。</p>
<p>這一來却不免父害怕又有趣了吧，便像廣吿上，或正同什麼聊齋誌一類書裏一般漂亮的鬼，一樣美，但若知道了她是鬼，就不免想到玉歷寶傳之類上面畫的披頭散髪張爪吐舌的樣兒，萬一來個變化，膽小如我之輩，就不免愛而遠之，有時雖也埋怨古人嚇人之兇，科學雖經昌明，鬼怪終究可怕，還是不知她是鬼而愛之的好，若等鬼死了才知道也不錯。但設若不知，便又乏味，難乎其和鬼談戀愛。</p>
<p>但一下却又覺得鬼的可愛了，悠悠然能超世獨立，要什麼有什麼，手一招錢就到，這樣最好，如其不然，能沒有一點烟火氣，不談酒鹽醬醋，不談白米煤球，祇談精神戀愛倒也淸爽；這樣戀愛固然很好，但，我想却不很容易，錫箔紙錠漲價，陰間生活程度尙不知如何，談這般戀愛，也要富鬼可談，這樣一想，倒不如玉歷寶傳上的女鬼可愛了，雖然披髮吐舌，紅眼綠毛，却還有一樣可取之處，却是恩怨分明，喜憎明確，不忸怩，不欺騙，好便好，不好一把指死你，人世的怨仇，死了也要報，有種！</p>
<p>這種想法，終究是殺風景的，戀愛對象，旣難確定，思想益發雜亂，由中國的鬼，又想到外國的鬼，記得果果里的小說裏常寫到鬼，替活人報仇，替死人出氣，確是十分可愛，聊齋誌異之類便顯得無力，因而我倒找到了一點，便是：鬼若可愛，不在她的沒有烟火氣，能飄飄然，倒是在她有明確的喜惡，敢怒，敢駡，敢哭，敢笑。</p>
<p>這樣固然最好，却還有點擔憂，鬼多能變，如花美女，一變便是靑面獠牙，然而閉眼一想，人的面目，何嘗容易確定，紳士架子，惡棍面相，是轉眼間的事，某哲學家曰：「我走遍世界，未嘗看見一個人」是乃哲理之談，但我希望不是說到這些「無形」的人之類，這會，我却有歌鬼頌怪之嫌，勸人愛鬼，是乃天下奇談，因而我鬼戀也祇好失戀。</p>
<p>東方發白，今天又得做一個昏昏）」憒憒的「人」。</p>

<h3>寓言的啟示</h3>
<p>— 曹爾蒼</p>
<p>V字運動以後，歐洲又流行着一則寓言。寓言的大竟是說希，墨，邱三位先生在偶然的巧合下，同到占卜光生處去占卜，想問問這次勝利的誰屬。這位聰明的占卜先生並沒有說未卜先知的一類話，祇拿了兩隻碗，—一隻空的而另一隻却有滿滿的水中蓄着一條小魚。吿訴他們，誰活捉了這魚，誰就得最後的勝利。希特勒先生是大字性急貨，凡事不加思索，以致水濺滿地，狼狽而退。墨索里尼先生呢，一等的粗坯，老在桌子邊兜圈子轉念頭。最後自然是邱吉爾先生贏的囉！他用容器把水移入另一空碗中，然後用手指夾起了這條小魚。</p>
<p>在大體上講，這寓言的木身尙稱無疵。因為它吿訴了我們三種人：一種是好大喜功，鹵莽的滅裂野漢，一種是蠢然思動，不自量力的粗貨，另一種卻是具有理智判斷的聰明人物。</p>
<p>單把這三種人作個深長的回味，已够敎訓我們了。</p>

<h3>上海人</h3>
<p>— 侯放</p>
<p>我從走過許久的地方裏，看到上海是最不好的地方，「只見衣冠不見人」的地方。</p>
<p>在南洋，腰纏萬貫的人，往往是赤着脚工作的人，他們是艱苦創業的人。在上海，高車駟馬的人，他們也許是創業的人，他們多是投機創業的人</p>
<p>赤脚的人捐輸祖國非常踴躍，他們要洩洩民族的氣。</p>
<p>高車駟馬的人不肯捐輸國家，但他們也受慣了民族的氣</p>

<h3>彎曲木片</h3>
<p>— 永運</p>
<p>當你看見圖中彎曲成各種形狀的東西，會相信它們是木片嗎？但是它們的確是木片，不過只有在華氏寒暑表二十二度時它才可隨意彎曲，冷却以後便恢復常態了。這種木片的製法大概是先把它浸在尿素溶液中直至木片中之一種質素與其相合時為止。這種木頭將來的用處一定很多，像作飛機機身，汽車車身，船等等。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十四　打英雄的生活</p>
<p>秋海棠的嘴裏雖也學着姓錢的樣，不迭聲的向這位後台經理道謝，但心裏恰眞比死還靴受。僅僅隔了十幾個年頭，情形是完全相反了！十八年前的自己，眞和一塊金鋼鑽一樣，到處搶着有人要；到了此刻，竟連一塊破銅都不如，想充個班底還得經這許多麻煩。</p>
<p>一吳老板，想開一些吧！人老珠黃小值錢，那一個唱戲的不是這樣啊？」那位錢先生倒眞是一個很難得的熱心人，看了他那一副難的神氣，便忙着多方勸　。「別說是你們唱戲的人，就是咱們吃報館飯的，一過五十歲也就不行啦！現在你愁也沒有用，但願時局平靜，你們父女兩位，……」</p>
<p>說到這一句話，他突然嚥住了，昂着頭略略想了一想。</p>
<p>「啊！吳老板，你那令愛今年總有十多歲了吧？方才我倒沒有請問過她能不能…」</p>
<p>不等錢若默再說下去，秋海棠也就明白了。</p>
<p>「你間她能不能出台嗎？現在祇怕還小能。」提到他的愛女，秋海棠的精神就振作起來了。（二四九）</p>

<p>— 君宜</p>
<p>林語堂編劇……米高梅攝製</p>
<p>這一個永遠使人不會淡忘的中國留美女明星黃柳霜，最近又是很久不上銀幕了，因為她今年春天已加入了芝加哥的一個歌舞學院裹担任舞蹈研究員，有到二千四百美金的週薪，這待遇可以說是相當優厚的。最近消息傳來，她為了發揮祖國四年來英勇奮戰的偉蹟起見，將再度加入攝影塲單獨主演一片。</p>
<p>劇本是留美中國文學家林語堂氏所編的「美麗之月」，（The　Beautiful　Moon）本劇的版權已由紐約某書店所購得，內容係叙述中國建國過程中一個英勇無比的故事，好萊塢因為久未攝製關於中國的影片，米高梅公司就決定採用這一個著作搬上銀幕，聘請黃柳霜女士担任本片主角，合演者為喬治茂番和另一位華籍演員王正漢，（譯音）本月初已開始拍攝，預計明年二月間可全部完成。</p>
<p>該片所得盈餘，據米高梅製片人員談，除將抽出一部份作為捐獻紐約市長發起的援華救濟金外。並將該片洗印一部於明年國際婦女節時捐贈中國政府，倘使這話實現，那末該片之轟動，定可預卜的了。</p>

<h3>Japan Again Increases Troops in Vietnam, Pacific Situation Becomes More Tense, US Will Use Philippine Islands as Defense and Offense Base, Britain Closely Watches Japanese Invasion of Timor Island</h3>
<p>Reuter, Hanoi, 29th: The tense situation in the South Pacific continues to escalate as Japan sends reinforcements to Tonkin, Vietnam. Japan has the right to station troops based on the agreement previously signed by Martin and Nishihara. The purpose of this troop increase is unknown, but it is likely to be for defensive deployments to prevent attacks from the Chinese side. Although the terrain is difficult and it is not easy for Japan to advance north or west, this possibility cannot be said to be completely absent.</p>
<p>Reuter, Rangoon, 219th: Tokyo Radio stated that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has sent Chinese troops to Burma to defend the Yunnan-Burma Highway. This statement is absurd, and those who hear it find it strange, comparing it to a Burmese proverb that an elephant cannot be hidden in a cowhide.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 29th: Observers here stated yesterday that the appointment of Major General Boynton to command the US Far East Air Force indicates the possibility of using the Philippines simultaneously as a base for offense and defense. Major General Boynton is an expert in heavy bombers. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall told the House Appropriations Subcommittee yesterday, "The defense of the Philippines is currently ranked first in priority." Furthermore, according to military sources, the Philippine army is being drafted into service more quickly.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 29th: According to the Tokyo News, a Guangzhou dispatch stated that many airfields have been built in Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong in China, which will be used by the British and American air forces. The construction of these airfields is the result of the visit to Chongqing by the military delegation led by US General Magruder. Ten bombers flying from Hong Kong have already landed at several airfields in Guangdong. The correspondent said that the northernmost airfield in the Philippines is 2,300 kilometers away from Kyushu Island, the southernmost part of Japan. The new airfields built in China have reduced this distance by at least 500 kilometers. The newspaper stated that although Japan and the United States are still in negotiations in Washington, these airfields are being rushed to completion at the same time.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Washington, 28th: According to Japanese news, the Japanese cabinet has decided that if the United States and Japan cannot reach an agreement before November 15, negotiations will be suspended. When Secretary of State Hull received the press today, reporters asked about this. He replied that he had not heard of it. It is also rumored that Britain will lease other naval and air bases to the United States again. Regarding this, Hull only said that he could not say anything definite.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 29th: Reliable sources here stated yesterday that Foreign Secretary Eden had discussed the new Japanese air route from Palau Island to Portuguese Timor Island with Portuguese Ambassador de Ro. Eden does not oppose this Japanese air route approaching Australia. However, it is said that he once indicated that Britain would strictly monitor any actual Japanese invasion of Timor Island, especially its colonization.</p>
<p>Reuter, 29th, Tokyo: Portuguese newspapers yesterday published the full text of the agreement signed by Portugal and Australia on December 11 last year to open an air route between Portuguese Timor Island and Darwin, and the agreement signed by Portugal and Japan on October 13 this year to open an air route between Timor Island and Palau Island, which is administered by Japan. Australia has recently been quite concerned about the Portuguese-Japanese agreement. Therefore, the article published in a certain Portuguese newspaper is worth noting. According to the article, the terms of the agreement do not prevent any of the three countries' governments from prohibiting any company or crew of the other party from landing or residing in its territory for national reasons. This statement is likely aimed at preventing "foreign intrusions."</p>
<h3>Japanese Major General Takeda's Broadcast Speech: Says He Is Determined to Break Through the Encirclement</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 29th: The Tokyo News quoted the words of Major General Takeda, the army representative of the Cabinet Information Bureau, today, saying that Japan must break through the ABCD encirclement. Takeda's words were broadcast to the whole country last night. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that the radio authorities would broadcast the speech again to China and Southeast Asia to reassure the nationals in those areas who are concerned about the true situation of their motherland. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that Takeda said, "The ABCD camp's actions based on fear of Japan are ridiculous, because Japan has not been exhausted even after four years of the Sino-Japanese War, and the countries of the ABCD front each have their own worries." Takeda said that every defeat of the Soviet Union in the Soviet-German war is enough to reduce the pressure on Japan, and that the countries in the ABCD front are all very afraid of Japan and hope that at least the war in Europe will continue, and that Japan will gain benefits from it. Takeda also said, "Economic oppression is the only advantage that Britain and the United States have over Japan, but regarding this point, Britain and the United States used it on July 26. It is not difficult for us to imagine what the next move will be. Therefore, we should recognize the true nature of the ABCD encirclement and strive to break through this encirclement with a constant belief in victory." Takeda also said that Chongqing is worried that the Japanese Kwantung Army in Manchuria will advance south to deal with Chongqing and resolve the China Incident. The Dutch East Indies is also worried about Japan's southward policy. Britain is also concerned about its "many assets in the East," so it sent Duff Cooper to Singapore. The United States' concern is that if an accident occurs in the Pacific, the aid to Britain cannot proceed smoothly, because the US Navy has not been able to fight in both oceans, and the war will interrupt the supply of rubber and tin from the Far East.</p>
<h3>US Plans to Cooperate Further with China and Britain, Plans to Borrow Global Bases from Britain, and Asks China and Britain to Lift Trade Restrictions</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 29th: Reliable sources recently stated that the United States, hoping for closer cooperation between Britain and the United States, has asked Britain to make all British bases around the world available to the United States for future use. This request is accompanied by a plan to ensure the establishment of a good world after the war. This plan was sent to China and Britain separately along with the lease-lend method agreed upon by the United States, China, and Britain. However, it is said that the United States has not asked China for bases. However, according to reliable sources, the United States has continued to ask China and Britain to cooperate in the following areas in order to prevent Japan's southward or northward advance and maintain their existing position in East Asia: (1) Lift excessive trade restrictions, (2) Ensure non-discriminatory treatment in international commercial relations, (3) Enjoy the same rights in the use of raw materials without discrimination, (4) Control supplies and commodities to ensure the interests of consumers and people in various countries, and accommodate all international funds that help major enterprises and benefit the continued development of various countries. It is said that Britain has accepted the above suggestions and China has also fully approved them.</p>
<h3>Japanese Representatives Extravagantly Talk About Developing Vietnam</h3>
<p>Establishing an Office in Hanoi</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Hanoi, 19th: Yokota, the head of the Japanese economic delegation, stated that the main goal of the Japanese economic delegation coming to Vietnam is to study the possibility of developing Vietnam's natural resources and industries. However, this type of development will take at least ten to twenty years. The delegation has set up a general office in Hanoi with a total of sixty members, who will send mining, industrial, and transportation experts to the interior of Vietnam to study and report on how to develop Vietnam's natural resources. The promotion of transportation convenience is also extremely necessary. The Vietnamese government has expressed its willingness to cooperate with the delegation to promote the realization of this plan, which is gratifying. Yokoyama stated that regardless of whether there is a war in the Pacific, the original intention of realizing Japanese-Vietnamese cooperation will not change.</p>
<h3>Germany Plans to Divide South America, Argentina Greatly Stimulated</h3>
<p>Reuter, Washington, 29th: President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that he had obtained a German-made map of the division of South America. The German side claimed that this map was forged, but in fact, this map was obtained from extremely reliable sources. He was not in a position to publish this map, nor was he in a position to publish the German document mentioned in his speech regarding the elimination of various religions. If published, it would block the source of information. This map has signs that could allow Germany to find its way. A reporter asked if he had shown this map to the South American countries. The President replied that he had not. If it is necessary to show it, it must be kept with the utmost secrecy, so that the German side will not have the opportunity to investigate the source.</p>
<p>United Press, Argentine Capital, 29th: President Roosevelt's mention in his speech yesterday of the Nazi map dividing South America has caused great stimulation here. According to President Roosevelt, in his Navy Day speech, the Nazis had decided to divide South America into five vassal states, subject to Nazi rule. In the streets and alleys, people and newspapers have expressed their hope that President Roosevelt will know the need to publish this map so that Latin American governments can know the seriousness of this matter. Former Argentine Foreign Minister Pele Don said, "I believe this statement will cause a major reaction in South America, and it can even be asserted that Hitler's failure in South America begins today."</p>
<h3>US-Made War Equipment Production Soars, Can Produce 2,000 Tanks Per Month by Next Summer, Rushing to Produce Aircraft for Use by Britain, Netherlands, and Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Reuter, New York, 29th: According to the American Machinery Industry Magazine, the United States will produce one hundred 60-ton tanks every month and have 100,000 employees in the entire manufacturing program. Medium tanks can currently produce 600 units per month, but this number is expected to increase to 2,000 units per month by next summer. The lack of aircraft engines has not been able to deliver them early, but seaplanes are now not in short supply. Sufficient seaplanes will continue to be produced. Some of these aircraft will be shipped to the United Kingdom, China, the Netherlands East Indies, and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union now wants machinery worth 40 million yuan in order to rebuild its industry in the Eastern Ural Mountains, while the United Kingdom wants machinery worth 10 million yuan.</p>
<h3>New Cambodian Monarch Crowned</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Phnom Penh, Vietnam, 28th: The new Cambodian monarch, Sihanouk, held his coronation ceremony today. Vietnamese Governor-General Teague also attended the ceremony and delivered a speech, emphasizing the close ties between Cambodia and France.</p>
<h3>Armistice Day, President Roosevelt to Deliver Another Speech, Remembering the Past, Encouraging the Future, Striving to Defend Human Freedom</h3>
<p>Navy Day Speech No Different Than Declaration of War on Germany</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Washington, 28th: President Roosevelt is scheduled to deliver a speech on November 11 next month, the Armistice Day of the last World War, at Arlington National Cemetery, in front of the graves of American war dead. He also issued a statement today, saying that the Armistice Day of 1918 was a symbol of the successful end of the war to save democracy. On this day, we should silently commemorate and show that we remember the past, strive again for the fundamental principles of human freedom, and defend our future.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Chongqing, 29th: Although the speeches of President Roosevelt and Secretary of the Navy Knox on US Navy Day have not created a new situation, the general impression here is that the United States has once again solemnly declared its major determination to strive for freedom of the seas at any cost. The Ta Kung Pao stated that, according to general observation, the US President's speech is, in fact, equivalent to a declaration of war on Germany, which is not an exaggeration. The US President also pointed out Germany's conspiracy against South America. Considering the power of the Axis countries in South America, it has caused fear in the United States, thereby hating Hitler and the United Kingdom during the same period. Therefore, the United States will sooner or later participate in the Atlantic War, which is a foregone conclusion. Under this tense situation, Japan has the possibility of causing trouble in the Far East to cooperate with its allies. Therefore, the United States should be especially vigilant against Japan. After praising the speeches of the US President and others, the Central Daily News also stated that in order to ensure that materials are safely transported to democratic countries, the United States will inevitably use its strong navy, but at this time, it must not forget the Nazi's Far East partner, who, under the leadership of a military cabinet, is strengthening its aggressive actions. If it is not completely resolved first, the backlash is unbearable. Therefore, the United States should at least pay equal attention to Europe and Asia and take care of both oceans, otherwise, the situation in the Far East will inevitably undergo major changes, making it impossible for the country to destroy Hitlerism with all its strength. The impact on the future of the war is truly not small.</p>
<h3>American Commentary</h3>
<p>Reuter, Washington, 29th: It is estimated that 50 million people in the United States alone listened to President Roosevelt's speech yesterday. The comments from Congress were mixed. Democratic Senator Hill said that the speech was timely and had the demeanor of a national leader, while isolationist Senator Chandler said that the President clearly regarded the cancellation of the Neutrality Act as Congress's approval for him to engage in a shooting war. President's Secretary O'Leary told reporters that after the speech was delivered, many people called and telegraphed to express their opinions, causing the White House telephone lines and telegraph lines to be overwhelmed. It is estimated that the White House received opinions in favor of the speech by a ratio of eight to one.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 29th: Florida Democratic Senator Pepper said yesterday that to defeat Germany, it is necessary to "gather the best military power" and strike at the vital points. He urged the United States to respond to President Roosevelt's call to "row our own boat." Pepper urged that the Neutrality Act be amended and also stated that in the spring of 1939, President Roosevelt had requested that the general arms embargo be abolished, but Congress did not allow it. This move allowed Hitler to do whatever he wanted, and finally invaded Poland and France. Senator Pepper said that the Nazis' actions were an "elastic rebellious force" that was underestimated, and said that Hitler would never give in and would rather choose between death, exile, or ruling the world.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Washington, 19th: President Roosevelt's speech on Navy Day has recently been criticized by political figures here, saying that this speech is almost equivalent to a declaration of war. In fact, the United States is already at war with Germany, but legally it has not yet been formally declared by Congress.</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 29th: The New York Times commented yesterday, "The newspaper believes that the American people are fully prepared for President Roosevelt's speech on the fact that the shooting war has already begun." The newspaper said, "We welcome the President's endorsement of the Senate's broader Neutrality Act. The various restrictions we are currently subject to are as beneficial to Hitler as a thousand submarines."</p>

<p>United Press, London, 29th: Government circles were very excited about President Roosevelt's Navy Day speech yesterday, but the common people were slightly disappointed because the United States had no new actions to match the President's war-like rhetoric. The Evening Star wrote in its commentary that the speech indicated that American warships and merchant ships would soon appear in our ports. The speech clearly told Hitler, German Fleet Commander-in-Chief Admiral Raeder, and the world that the United States was preparing to cross the Atlantic in a shooting stance. Whether it is to Britain or to the United States, the United States is now entering the war in a slow but definite manner. The News Chronicle wrote a huge headline across the entire page, "The United States Stands on the War Post," and wrote in its commentary that President Roosevelt has awakened the public to take further action on inevitable facts.</p>
<p>Reuter, London, 19th: The Star commented on President Roosevelt's broadcast on Navy Day, saying that Hitler hoped that the US President would talk about Japan and divert the US President's attention to him. This is one of Hitler's favorite dodging methods, but the US President was not fooled. The speech did not mention Japan at all, because he did not want to shift his focus from the main target. Tojo's saber-rattling did not distract President Roosevelt from his main enemy, but concentrated his attention.</p>
<h3>German Side Resentful</h3>
<p>Reuter, London, 29th: The comments issued by Berlin officials on President Roosevelt's Navy Day speech were listed as violent, and their anger was beyond words. The German radio station broadcast to the nation, denouncing Roosevelt as a despicable manipulator and a "ridiculous puppet controlled by international Jews," and said that his speech was "extremely despicable."</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 19th: Berlin believes that President Roosevelt's speech, which claimed Germany's conspiracy to conquer South America and abolish Christianity and other creeds, is purely propaganda and is extremely absurd and foolish. German officials believe that it is not worth denying. Roosevelt's speech is a standard product of Jewish forgery factories and does not need to be taken seriously. His claim that the discovery of documents proves that Germany wants to establish its own national religion and abolish the existing religious creeds, according to Berlin, a booklet was obtained in northern Germany earlier this month that was dropped from the sky, the content of which was exactly the same as what Roosevelt said. This may be due to the lack of coordination between the British and American propaganda agencies, which caused the booklet prepared by the British side to be dropped before the time was ripe. As for the layer on a map made by the German side showing the scope of the new order in South America, a German foreign ministry spokesman said this may be a map published by German newspapers showing British air bases in South America. The so-called German desire to abolish all religions is probably Roosevelt's desire to frighten South America and incite churches around the world against Germany. Roosevelt obviously does not have a deep understanding of the intelligence of Americans, thinking that Americans are easily deceived and can make them realize their diplomatic and political goals. Roosevelt's speech is the same as the previous frenzy of American pro-war factions, with the mark of Jewish falsehood engraved on it. Americans will never agree with Roosevelt's views and methods. Roosevelt is strongly trying to drag Americans into the vortex of war. The American people will judge this selfish policy of the Jews.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspapers Express Dissatisfaction</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 29th: Tokyo Japanese newspapers today unanimously attacked President Roosevelt's statement that the United States would continue to aid Chongqing. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated that this aid would be ineffective. The Hochi Shimbun stated that President Roosevelt's failure to mention the Far East problem was not important, because the United States' opposition to Japan in the Pacific was the same as its opposition to Germany, and the goal was the same as Japan's goal.</p>
<h3>Reuter News Agency Strives to Develop Business</h3>
<p>Now Wholly Owned by British National Newspapers, Maintaining a Transcendent Position, Striving for Accurate News</p>
<p>Reuter, London, 29th: After discussions between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Information, the method of financial management of the Reuters News Agency is now announced as follows: The Newspaper Proprietors' Association has sold half of its ownership of all Reuters shares to the Newspaper Society. The two parties jointly form a trusteeship group. Reuters is therefore wholly owned by the national newspapers. The two associations have signed a declaration of trusteeship, stating the principles that will be maintained under the new ownership, that is, its nature is trusteeship rather than investment. Both parties also undertake to make their best efforts to ensure (1) that Reuters shall at no time fall into the hands of any party or faction, (2) at all times maintain the integrity, independence, and freedom of Reuters in full, (3) maintain the business of Reuters so as to provide accurate and reliable news to newspapers and news agencies in British territories, self-governing territories, colonies, foreign countries, and other overseas areas, (4) give proper consideration to the various interests of Reuters services and the interests of the newspaper industry, and (5) develop and expand the business of Reuters with all its strength, so as to maintain its position as the world's largest news agency. The trustees are jointly recommended by the Newspaper Proprietors' Association and the Newspaper Society, with an equal number from both sides, to implement the above guarantees, and the chairman of the trusteeship group is appointed by the Lord Chancellor. The management department of Reuters is presided over by six directors representing the Newspaper Proprietors' Association and the Newspaper Society. The term of office of the trusteeship group is twenty-one years and shall not be dissolved unless the Lord Chancellor deems it inappropriate.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops, Ten Thousand Strong, Invade Westward from Hejin; Chinese Troops Meet the Attack and Claim Success; Reserve Forces Arranged Behind Enemy Lines Have Begun Offensive; North Henan Chinese Troops Once Press Close to Zhengzhou Suburbs</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Military sources report that Japanese troops have continued activities in the Hejin area in southwestern Shanxi province, estimated to be ten thousand strong. They are currently attempting to clear the area around Hejin, which is located on the north bank of the Fen River, close to the Shaanxi border. Fighting is ongoing, with the Chinese troops offering strong resistance. According to Chinese sources, three Japanese transport ships and five motorboats were sunk by mines in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River in the past two weeks. One of the transport ships was carrying a number of Japanese soldiers. (Reuter, 29th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Military reports state: (1) Over two thousand Japanese troops advancing northwest from Hejin via Kejian reached Shijiatan and Dongchuanwo on the evening of the 27th. By the morning of the 28th, the Japanese troops advancing southwest from Kejian had increased to over four thousand, advancing to Xialing Dongshan via Shimiao and other places, and continued to fiercely attack Longmen Mountain. At the same time, Japanese troops in Yujiadian and other places northwest of Hejin also shelled Donglongmen Mountain with artillery. Another unit of Japanese troops harassed the area near Shenqian Village via Zhanjiadian and Jiajiagou from Hejin. Chinese troops in that area are determined to fight the Japanese to the death. The fighting is extremely fierce, with heavy casualties on both sides. The bloody battle continues. Chinese troops flanking the Japanese and reserve forces positioned behind the enemy have now launched offensives separately and are progressing smoothly. (2) In the Donglongmen Mountain area, fighting continued between Chinese and Japanese troops on the original battlefield from noon on the 28th to the morning of the 29th without pause. (3) At 2 a.m. on the 23rd, part of the Japanese troops in Chaoyang advanced towards the northwest but were intercepted by Chinese troops. In the afternoon, Japanese reinforcements advanced to the Baifenshan area and continued to engage in fierce fighting with Chinese troops. (4) Part of the Japanese troops in Zhaojun Tomb and Sancun and other places attacked Lujia Yita on the morning of the 23rd but were ambushed by Chinese troops. The Japanese forces, suffering losses, released smoke screens to cover their retreat. (Dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: News received here this morning states that ten thousand Japanese troops have been actively clearing Chinese troops on both banks of the Fen River in southwestern Shanxi province over the past two days. At the same time, Japanese troops near Zhengzhou and Xinyang are also preparing for action. (Domei News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesperson revealed yesterday that the Japanese are currently reinforcing their garrisons in Zhengzhou in northeastern Henan province and Xinyang in southeastern Henan province with tens of thousands of troops in preparation for new offensives. The number of Japanese troops currently concentrated in these two locations is more than six times greater than when the Japanese entered central Henan in February. The Japanese have breached the new course of the Yellow River east of Zhengzhou. Two months ago, I saw Chinese guerrillas, spies, and smugglers regularly crossing the river by sand boat to the occupied areas. The Japanese have already penetrated the Chinese defense line on the right bank of the Yellow River. I saw a 300-mile dike there, hastily built to prevent flooding from the new possible course of the Yellow River southeast of Zhengzhou. The Japanese have launched attacks in the villages around Zhengzhou and have been able to use part of a vast network of trenches and sunken communication lines that crisscross the fields. The large concentration of Japanese troops, tanks, artillery, and cavalry in Zhengzhou and Xinyang poses a major threat to the fertile plains of central Henan. The central Henan plain juts into the occupied area like a giant peninsula. I personally traversed this plain and found it extremely suitable for the Japanese mechanized units to conduct blitzkrieg attacks. Except for the mountainous region on the western border of Henan province, the Japanese can roam freely in the countryside, regardless of roads. Especially now that most of the crops have been harvested and the fields are empty, tanks can move unimpeded regardless of roads and can encircle any defensive position. A Japanese offensive appears imminent and will be a war of rapid movement. As I crossed this fertile Henan plain, I saw endless fields planted with grains and other edible crops. This alone is enough to motivate the Japanese to seize this area, as it would alleviate their supply problems and seize this Chinese granary. I have heard of the brave deeds of the local militia. During the last Japanese offensive in the spring, the militia ambushed Japanese troops and their organization and training have since been improved. After traveling through this area, I am left with the impression that if the Japanese occupy this area, they will not only obtain a large supply of food, but also prevent future Chinese counteroffensives north of the Yangtze River on the great plains. (Graham, United Press Correspondent, 29th)</p>
<p>Luoyang: On the night of the 24th, a Chinese unit launched an attack on Zhengzhou from the line of Shibali, Haigeng, and Huanggangsi, completely eliminating the Japanese forces in the strongholds along the way. They approached the city gates and engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese, causing many casualties. (Dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>Luoyang: At midnight on the 27th, a Chinese unit dispatched teams to attack the Japanese troops in the old Rongze County town of Shuangwangcheng and other places. They attacked Shuangwangcheng and engaged in street fighting with the Japanese. By dawn, many Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, and many fortifications were destroyed. (Dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>Changde: Chinese troops on the north bank are recently very active in the Wancheng and Lijiapu area. The Japanese troops in Jingzhou and Shashi feel very uneasy. Fierce fighting broke out again near Lijiapu on the afternoon of the 27th, and the sound of gunfire and artillery did not cease until late at night. (Dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<h3>Chinese and Soviet Authorities Deny Alliance</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Both authoritative Chinese sources and the Soviet Embassy here today dismissed as laughable repeated reports from the Domei News Agency that General Chiang Kai-shek and Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi had been in contact with the Soviet Embassy here to conclude a military alliance. Chinese authoritative sources stated that Chairman Chiang was not in Chongqing on October 19th, the date on which the Soviet Ambassador was reported to have discussed with Chairman Chiang the possibility of increasing Soviet military support and the manpower that China could provide in the event of a Japanese attack on Siberia. The Soviet Embassy stated that the news was completely fabricated. (United Press, 29th)</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Speaks on One-Party Rule</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Sun Ke, President of the Chinese Legislative Yuan, stated in a speech to graduates of Fudan University that the Democratic League's advocacy of abolishing the one-party system was a mistake. "President Roosevelt of the United States was elected by the Democratic Party and is the leader of that party. British Prime Minister Churchill is supported by the Conservative Party and is also the leader of that party. Similarly, Hitler and Mussolini are the leaders of the Nazi and Fascist parties, respectively. In all countries of the world, the government is in the hands of a political party. The country and the party are inseparable." In China, the party and the country are one and inseparable, because the Republic of China was founded by the Kuomintang. Since the Northern Expedition, political power has been in the hands of the Kuomintang, and since July 7, 1937, the Kuomintang has led China in resisting aggression. "The party-ruled government in China today is no different from other governments. Does abolishing one-party rule mean abolishing political parties? Or will the government be placed in the hands of several weak political parties? Abolishing one-party rule is equivalent to changing the government, and the government is currently engaged in resisting aggression. Would this not be tantamount to abandoning resistance? Therefore, the Democratic League's proposal to abolish one-party rule is not appropriate. The Three Principles of the People, on which the Kuomintang is based, are most suitable for China's needs."

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Speech and the Far East</h3>
<p>Among all countries already drawn into the whirlpool of war, the United States is uniquely positioned on the watershed of war. From a legalistic standpoint, the amendment or repeal of the Neutrality Act is still a matter of intense debate in the US Congress. In other words, the US has not yet been able to break free from the constraints of the Neutrality Act, so naturally, talk of joining the war is premature. However, in terms of practical actions, beyond the confines stipulated by the Neutrality Act, such as support for China, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, stern condemnation and decisive measures against aggressor nations, the order to fire on Axis ships, and the subsequent implementation of escorting and arming merchant ships, all indicate that the US has long been engaged in an anti-aggression war. Precisely because the US is adopting such a peculiar, seemingly contradictory stance, it has given rise to various speculations and fantasies, suspicions that the US authorities still harbor appeasement intentions toward certain aggressors, or attempts to expand the war to the Western Hemisphere to deter the US from taking action. However, as of recently, the facts have already made it clear that even if the US does not immediately join the war, it has at least publicly declared its determination to thoroughly destroy the aggressors and has also completed the necessary preparations for contingency plans in the military field. No matter how the situation evolves in the future, this basic tone will only become more active and sharper, with absolutely no possibility of wavering. President Roosevelt's speech on Navy Day on the 27th provides a strong guarantee for this.</p>
<p>In this speech, Roosevelt exposed Nazi conspiracies, severely condemned the evils of aggression, and his moving rhetoric was consistent with his previous statements. However, his composure and optimism were rarely seen before. He pointed out that the shipment of US arms to friendly nations is the will of the entire US nation. Although the unfortunate incidents of ships being sunk and crew members being harmed have occurred one after another, they are by no means sufficient to prevent the US from abandoning its original intentions. He also decided to respond by arming merchant ships and amending the Neutrality Act. He stated explicitly that the Nazi advance could be and would be stopped, and he believed that the task undertaken by the US would not fail and would not be allowed to fail. He further severely criticized the views of defeatists, believing that the US, relying on its great talents and historical traditions, is fully prepared to meet the newest and greatest challenges. Looking at the overall meaning of the speech, although he still regarded manufacturing more arms to supply China, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union as the US's greatest task, he was by no means afraid of or evaded war. If the aggressors were to make further provocations, what they would get would not be the deterrence of the US, but the resolute resistance of the US.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, Roosevelt's speech, like some of his previous pronouncements, did not explicitly mention the Far East and Japan, which may again cause some doubts or fantasies. In fact, the US's attitude and direction toward the Far East cannot be discerned from this one incident. It is a fact that Roosevelt's speeches have not explicitly mentioned the Far East for some time, and that negotiations between the US and Japan have been intermittent until now. However, the US authorities have never relaxed their preparations for contingencies in the Far East because of this. Precisely at the same time that Roosevelt delivered his Navy Day commemorative speech, the US appointed the first Commander of the Far East Air Force, and it was rumored that the US Asiatic Fleet had sailed to Singapore. Undoubtedly, these practical measures have more power to influence the overall situation in the Far East. On the 24th of this month, US Secretary of the Navy Knox, speaking to naval ordnance manufacturers, stated that if Japan does not abandon its expansion plan, then conflict in the Far East is inevitable. In recent days, the Japanese government and public have been quite alarmed by this. We believe that this is by no means Knox's personal view, because the same conclusion can be reached based on the US authorities' consistent stance. Although Japan was not mentioned in Roosevelt's speech this time, China was repeatedly mentioned. He regarded supplying China, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union with arms as the most important task of the US, and stated that he dared not fail and would not fail in the implementation of this task. This also implies that the US must carry out its mission of supplying China with arms, without interruption due to any obstruction or difficulty. This has already demonstrated the US's firm stance on the Far East and the limits that the US will not allow to be involved in negotiations with Japan.</p>
<p>The US has always had great concern for the Far East, and it must be more aware of everything there than any other Western power. Therefore, the world does not need to worry that the US will be deceived or misled on such issues. The US itself does not want to provoke war, whether in the West or in the Far East. Now that the Nazis have openly provoked the US, the US is responding with the destruction of Nazism, while Japan is still seeking a path to compromise with the US. Therefore, the US is also avoiding some unnecessary provocations. As for the US's basic national policy, which is based on the principle of opposing aggression, it will never be given more or less importance or change due to temporary international interests. Its attitude toward the Sino-Japanese War has been fully expressed in some measures against Japan, especially in the implementation of the Lend-Lease Act to China. If the chaos in the Far East goes beyond the scope of the Sino-Japanese War, then US forces will definitely respond more decisively immediately. In terms of active action, this may be slightly insufficient, but in terms of responding to emergencies and suppressing chaos, the US has long had sufficient preparation and determination, and there is no need to worry about it.</p>
<h3>Reinforcements Bolster the Front Lines, Launching a General Counteroffensive in the Snow; The Situation in the Donets Basin Remains Critical; Germany Claims to Have Broken Through the Soviet Defense Line in Crimea</h3>
<p>United Press, New York, 29th: The local United Press yesterday monitored a Berlin radio report stating that the decisive battle between Germany and the Soviet Union has begun amidst the first snow.</p>
<p>International News Service, London, 29th: According to news arriving in London today, the Soviet army has received reinforcements of hundreds of thousands of troops, forcing German forces to retreat west and southwest of Moscow. The "Daily Express" announced this morning that one million Soviet troops have moved west from Siberia to defend Moscow and Rostov. Another 200,000 reinforcements will also arrive soon. The newspaper continued to say that the Soviet army has sufficient troops in the Far East to cope with the Japanese invasion of the coastal provinces. Moscow Radio today strongly stated, "The Soviet army launched a counteroffensive in the Maloyaroslavets area near Moscow two days ago and is still very successful. At the same time, the Soviet army north of Orel is putting up a strong resistance after reinforcements arrived." It also said, "The Red Army in the Kalinin area has recovered several villages and annihilated a large number of enemies."</p>
<p>International News Service, London, 29th: Military sources here told an International News Service reporter that German forces at some strongholds on the central front are now 378 to 40 miles from Moscow, and only 10 to 13 miles from Rostov, the gateway to the Caucasus oil fields. They pointed out that because both sides, the Soviet Union and Germany, are strictly guarding the secrecy of accurate information, it is very difficult to know the accurate situation of the war.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 29th: According to Moscow Radio, the Soviet army is now carrying out counteroffensives on several fronts near Moscow, and enemy attempts to cross the Nara River have been repelled. All crossings of the Volga River are now firmly held by the Soviet army. The fighting in the Orel area is now intensifying.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th: According to recent news received here, the German offensive against Moscow has not weakened, and the threat of breaking into the important industrial area of the Donets Basin is also increasing. At the same time, a news agency officially announced that after ten days of bloody fighting, German forces have entered the Crimean Peninsula, and the Perekop defense line has been broken through. German forces are now in pursuit. Judging from the current war situation, German forces in the Moscow campaign seem to be trying to find a weak point in the Soviet army's arc-shaped outer defense line. According to Moscow Radio today, at least part of the vanguard of the German army led by General Bock is now about 40 miles from the Soviet capital. Although there is no indication that the danger to Moscow has diminished, the Soviet army seems to have been able to contain the German offensive quite successfully and has been able to take the opportunity to counterattack in some places. However, the situation in the south seems to have caused the Soviets concern. "Red Star" admitted that German forces have entered the Donets Basin, and the momentum of their advance has not been contained, and the situation is quite critical. The streets of Kharkov have become battlefields, and the troops under General Timoshenko are now fighting hard to stop the German forces. The German offensive in the direction of Taganrog seems to have been stopped about 10 to 15 miles from Rostov.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 29th: A German Air Force spokesman claimed that German planes bombed Moscow fiercely last night, precisely when the weather was clear, dropping tons of bombs and thousands of incendiary bombs. Several bombs exploded near the Kremlin, and the city of Moscow was brightly lit.</p>
<p>German Situation Increasingly Difficult; Red Army on the Northern Front Changes from Defense to Offense</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th: Reuters military commentator Sir Goff said that the great war on Soviet territory, to which the world situation is tied, is still undecided. Although German forces have made progress in some areas such as the Donets River basin, their military situation cannot be said to have improved. It would not be wrong to say that the German situation has deteriorated. On the far northern front and the Leningrad front, the Soviet army is now taking the offensive, and the German army has changed to the defensive. The German army on the left flank of the 150-mile-long Moscow front seems to have been blocked in Kalinin. The central front has made some progress, but it is slow and costly, and still encounters strong Soviet resistance. The same is true of the German army's right flank in the Orel area.</p>
<p>Red Army Commanders at All Fronts Are Talented; Large Numbers of New Troops Are Being Trained</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th: General Timoshenko has now taken over the Southern Front army after its reorganization and has deployed a very strong defensive line along the Don River in the rear. At the same time, Budyonny and Voroshilov have been tasked with training large numbers of new troops in the central part of the Soviet Union, east of the Volga River and east of Moscow. It is said that these new troops are equipped with tanks and various modern equipment.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Milan, 28th: The Italian evening newspaper recently published a telegram from a correspondent stationed in Berlin, describing in detail the Soviet command's reassignment of Zhukov as commander of the central front in order to fully defend Moscow. It is said that the Soviet line has now been changed from three fronts to two fronts. Zhukov not only replaced Timoshenko as commander of the central front, but also concurrently commanded the northern front. Voroshilov has not returned to his post in Leningrad since the Moscow National Congress. It is said that Zhukov is very experienced in fortress warfare, so he has been appointed as the commander of Moscow's defense line, so that he can give full play to his strengths.</p>
<p>Battle for Crimea; German Casualties Exceed 50,000</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th: Moscow Radio announced last night that the German army has suffered more than 20,000 casualties in the past five days of fierce fighting in Crimea. From September 24 to October 4, the German army first attempted to invade Crimea, and the German side also suffered 10,000 casualties in this battle.</p>
<p>United Press, Kuibyshev, 29th: "Pravda" said yesterday that the battle on the southern front is one of the most thrilling in history, and the intensity of the battle in Rostov and the Don River basin is still not enough to describe it.</p>
<p>Soviet Union, Kuibyshev, 500 miles east</p>
<h3>German Planes Transporting Oil; 100 Destroyed</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th: Moscow Radio last night announced that the German side is now using aircraft on a large scale to transport oil to the eastern front. The Soviet Air Force has discovered 150 such oil transport aircraft in the Orel area and has strafed and bombed them, destroying at least 100 oil transport enemy aircraft.</p>
<h3>Turkey: Independence Day; Prime Minister Urges National Unity to Cope with the Current Crisis</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Istanbul, 28th: Turkish Prime Minister Saydam delivered a speech to the nation on the occasion of Independence Day, stating, "In these turbulent times, Turkey has been able to protect its safety, not because of anything else, but because of the unity of the whole country. This force of unity is enough to get our country out of all difficulties. I hope that the people of the country will work hard in their respective positions and not slack off, because the crisis will not stop at any time. In short, Turkey will definitely become stronger and stronger in the future."</p>
<p>Reuters, Ankara, 29th: Turkish President İsmet İnönü will deliver an important speech on foreign policy in Parliament on Saturday. His speech will be broadcast at that time.</p>
<h3>Beaverbrook May Resign Due to Asthma Requiring Rest</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th: There has been much speculation here about Beaverbrook's political future. It has been rumored in recent days that Mr. Beaverbrook's long-standing asthma has worsened due to his busy schedule and tiring journey to the UK-Soviet conference. Although Mr. Beaverbrook intends to work hard in public service, he may need to rest for some time to recover his health. According to the "Daily Herald," Mr. Beaverbrook does not want to leave important positions vacant at this critical time and may decide to resign so that others can be appointed to take charge of the Ministry of Supply immediately.</p>
<h3>US Lend-Lease New Funds; President Signs into Law</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 29th: President Roosevelt yesterday signed the $6,161,000,000 supplementary Lend-Lease funding bill and issued an executive order concentrating Lend-Lease Act administrative matters in the Executive Office of the President's Bureau of Budget. The President also appointed Stettinius as Lend-Lease Administrator. The total Lend-Lease funding passed by Congress, including this one, amounts to $12,985,000,000.</p>
<h3>Content of the Anglo-Soviet-Iranian Alliance</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Istanbul, 29th: Turkish sources have learned that the main points of the Anglo-Soviet-Iranian alliance recently signed are as follows: (1) The UK and the Soviet Union will provide economic assistance to Iran; (2) If Iran is attacked by a third country, the UK and the Soviet Union have an obligation to provide assistance. If Iran requests the UK and the Soviet Union to guarantee its existing borders, the UK and the Soviet Union must guarantee them; (3) The UK and the Soviet Union promise to withdraw the British and Soviet troops stationed in Iran when the overall world situation permits; (4) The Iranian government promises that the UK and Soviet troops may use Iran's railways when they need to pass through Iran.</p>

<h3>Large Short Positions Gradually Gain the Upper Hand; Cotton Yarn Prices Fall to the Limit Again</h3>
<p>After being maintained by large investors for several consecutive days, the yarn market, which had been rising continuously, once again fell to the limit yesterday. The listed price was 2,330 yuan. The unofficial off-exchange market was bullish, gradually rising to 2,445 yuan. Shortly thereafter, news spread that the sales of spot yarn had been cut off, and the selling price plummeted by 80 to 200 yuan. Investor sentiment was once again shaken, and the market finally weakened to 2,390 yuan. Another rumor put the price as low as 2,360 or 2,370 yuan. However, the market saw a slight recovery in the afternoon, but the overall trend was relatively calm, although still somewhat chaotic. As for the prices of yarn and cloth on the exchange, short sellers clearly covered their positions, and the market turned softer, with a majority of short sellers. Everyone is watching and waiting for the opportunity to change before deciding the outcome. Therefore, the yarn market may take a temporary break, because it has risen in a straight line from a price of 1,700 yuan to 2,500 or 2,600 yuan, a huge increase of 800 or 900 yuan. Moreover, spot yarn sales are prohibited, and exports are not possible. The inventory is relatively high, and the momentum is certain. Everyone's profits should be cashed out. It is reported that only 4,200 bales were traded in half a day.</p>
<p>The Jin Shuang Ma futures market situation continues to show a declining trend due to special and ever changing circumstances. Since the sharp rise, new high prices have emerged, making it impossible for the general short positions to resist, retreating to the final defensive line. Unexpectedly, a strange encirclement suddenly occurred. The long positions were unstable and felt that they had no place to use their strength. The morning opened with US cotton downstream and factory orders again falling to the limit, and the yarn futures followed suit, appearing quite withered on the ground. There were very few new trades, and short sellers were quite persistent due to the decline in factory orders. Although there were some long positions holding on in this storm, many were also closing out their positions and waiting for an opportunity to move. Therefore, the selling pressure on the surface was relatively strong. The November contract opened at 2,390 yuan and once rose to 2,430 yuan, but in the afternoon it fell again to 2,345 yuan. The December contract opened at 2,400 yuan, almost a high opening, but it also fell to 2,395 yuan in the afternoon. The January contract opened at a high price of 2,490 yuan and immediately fell to 2,430 yuan. The difference between the daily high and low prices was nearly 100 yuan for the near-term contract and 50 to 60 yuan for the deferred contracts. As a result, the November contract closed at 2,345 yuan, down 75 yuan, the December contract at 2,410 yuan, down 69 yuan, and the January contract at 2,460 yuan, down 58 yuan. The details are listed below.</p>
<h3>Yarn Factories Slightly Purchase Fine Cotton</h3>
<p>——Transactions Not as Lively as in the Past</p>
<p>The spot cotton situation is weakening along with the yarn market, and as a result, transactions are not as lively as in the past. In fact, the degree of step-by-step price increases is also considerable. The yarn market has turned downward, and the cotton market should also ease a step. Factories have slightly purchased fine cotton, and cotton brokers are actively trading.</p>
<p>New York cotton cloth rose in the morning due to purchases by other traders, but then fell back due to sales of New Orleans and profit-taking by long positions. As a result, yesterday's closing prices rose by 2 to 10 points.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market first fell due to cotton merchant hedging, then rose again due to purchases by European exporters and short covering, and finally fell again due to reactionary sales and profit-taking by long positions. Yesterday's closing prices fell by about 1 to 2 rupees. It is also predicted that today's opening will rise by 75 rupees.</p>
<h3>Cash Rise Has Been Thwarted; 19,000 Yuan; Twice Breaking Out and Returning</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw that the futures market fell and the spot market rose again, with fluctuations in between. Although the October futures contract had buying from the Guang Gang to cover short positions, which lifted the price to 8,500 yuan, securities firms came out to lower the market price, and the final price was 7,900 yuan, a further drop of 300 yuan, with trading volume of about 100 taels. The cash price first fell and then rose, but ultimately fell slightly, causing the 19,000 yuan mark to be broken out of twice before returning below it. When the market opened in the morning, cash firms and Tianjin and Hong Kong groups sold vigorously, and the price once fell to 18,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, a certain new bank came in to buy forcefully, raising the price to a high of 19,100 yuan. The price immediately fell back. High prices were seen again in the afternoon, but gold firms and the Tianjin group continued to sell, and the 19,000 yuan level was immediately returned. The final increase was only 350 yuan. The total daily trading volume was 2,450 taels. The price of jewelry also first fell and then rose, resulting in an increase of 30 yuan, to 1,910 yuan.</p>
<p>Cash First Falls and Then Rises</p>
<p>For cash spot, the morning opened high by 200 yuan, with Xin Yuan, Jin He, and Sheng selling ten taels for 18,600 yuan. Cash firms and Tianjin group sold again, bringing the price down to 18,000 yuan. Tian Yuan, Xiang He, De Fu, and Ming Feng suddenly came in to buy, and the price gradually rose by 800 to 900 yuan. At 11:30, De Cheng called to sell at 18,900 yuan. At the same time, a certain bank also bought 30 taels from Cheng Ji and others for 19,100 yuan, while De Cheng continued to call for sale at 18,900 yuan. De Fu, Xiang He, and Xin Yuan all sold, pressing the price slightly lower. The noon closing price was 18,750 yuan. In the afternoon, De Cheng first bought ten taels from Zhong Xing for 19,100 yuan, up 390 yuan. Then Xiang He, Cheng Ji, Ming Feng, Tian Yuan, Heng Ji and others were seen selling, bringing the price back down by 350 yuan. The closing price at 4:00 pm was 18,790 yuan, a rebound of 350 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The daily high-low range was 1,100 yuan. The selling price of cash firms' own brand, Jinmen, was 19,000 yuan, and the buying price was still 1,000 yuan less.</p>
<p>Futures Unable to Rise</p>
<p>For the October futures contract, the morning opened at 8,100 yuan per bar (ten taels), the same as the previous day's closing price. Heng Ji raised the price to 8,500 yuan, and Tong Kang and Yong sold, causing the price to fall sharply back to 8,200 yuan at noon. The afternoon opened at 8,200 yuan. Heng Ji advanced to 8,400 yuan. The closing price at 4:00 pm was only 7,900 yuan, a further decrease of 300 yuan compared to the previous day. The daily high-low range was 600 yuan.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Selling Turns Enthusiastic; Gold Pounds and Gold Certificates Still Diverge</h3>
<p>In yesterday's foreign exchange market, the posted prices of the Central Bank and HSBC were both flat. The small counter prices of HSBC and others were unchanged. The unofficial black market for US dollars continued to loosen slightly. Although there were large amounts of settlement payments for white coal in US dollar certificates, the price remained around 36 yuan. However, the sentiment of Chinese merchants who held long positions was moving, and the number of sellers increased. There were no buyers for US$3, and importers of non-essential goods bought US dollars at 3.125, and exporters also offered sales at the same price. There was more supply than demand at noon, and only small amounts were bought at 3.375. The noon closing price was 3.125. English gold was 0.02, which was higher than the US dollar by 0.125. English gold was flat. There was no market in the afternoon due to Wednesday.</p>
<p>In yesterday's foreign currency market, English and American gold pounds both rose by 20 yuan, English gold certificates rebounded by 1 yuan, US dollar certificates initially traded at 37 yuan, then gradually retreated to 35.5 yuan, and the final price was 36.4 yuan, down 0.4 yuan from the previous day. There was again demand for Hong Kong certificates, and the market price rose by 0.1 yuan. The downward trend of Japanese gold certificates has stopped, and the evening market still stood at the original price of 3.2 yuan. There was strong demand for Korean certificates, and the evening market rose to 2.7 yuan.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Rice Stabilizes the Rice Market; Small-Texture Rice Flows Downstream</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rising trend of foreign rice was thwarted. In the early market, continuing the rise of the previous night's unofficial trading, small-texture current rice still opened at 162-163 yuan, No. 1 Saigon at 185-186 yuan, No. 2 at 165-166 yuan, and Shanghai Anglo-Chinese current rice was at 191-192.6 yuan, and current rice at 188 yuan. Shortly thereafter, news came that the Shanghai Municipal Council was determined to maintain prices, and since its current supply of fair-priced current rice was sufficient and future batches would also arrive steadily, it announced that it would maintain the retail price of 117 yuan throughout. Investor sentiment immediately turned downward, speculators stopped hoarding, and profits were cashed out. Small-texture rice fell sharply to 157 yuan, and Shanghai Anglo-Chinese current rice also had low prices of 182.5 yuan and 179 yuan. However, the low prices triggered absorption by speculators and speculative buying. The noon closing price of small-texture rice rebounded to 161 yuan. However, in the afternoon, the Shanghai Municipal Council officially released 30,000 bags of fair-priced small-texture rice at a low price of 136.276 yuan, and the market immediately moved downward, with small-texture late closing at 198-199 yuan, lacking buyers. The total daily trading volume also decreased to 15,000 bags, and Shanghai Anglo-Chinese at 800 tons.</p>
<p>The selling intention for thick/thin, new broken and japonica and other domestic rice was still strong, increasing by 1-2 yuan. The opening price for early broken rice from southern ports was 194-192 yuan, Kunshan new japonica 191-192 yuan, Qingjiao kiln seed, Fengjing white rice, and 191-192 yuan, Sijing wild rice white 95 yuan.</p>
<p>The rising trend of glutinous rice was unabated, and the price of Hong Kong rice reached a new high of 200 yuan that had never been seen before. Ordinary goods were priced at 197 yuan, followed by 193 yuan, and glutinous tea white at 85-86 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour Profits Released</p>
<p>The flour market was extremely weak in the morning, continuing the weak sentiment of the previous night, and it was also heard that fair-priced flour would soon be obtained. Speculators released their profits. Jinlong and Dongxizhan flour both fell to 47.2-47.3 yuan, a sharp drop of more than 1 yuan compared to the previous night. However, the low prices immediately triggered absorption by customer speculators and speculative covering. The market then gradually increased. In the afternoon, the Dajin group added offices due to exchange rate agreements. Large speculators and customer speculators gathered to absorb, and Jinlong once rose to 49.1 yuan. Speculators then slightly released, and the closing price was 48.7 yuan. The morning opening price of the Fort was 50 yuan, rose to 51 yuan in the afternoon, and the evening closing price was 50.05 yuan. Huangjin also needed 48.7 yuan, still a rebound of 0.3-0.5 yuan compared to the previous closing. The bran and wheat markets were unchanged due to the holding action of traders and speculators.</p>
<h3>江北生油將到 油價稍形鬆動</h3>
<p>Jiangbei raw oil is about to arrive, oil prices are slightly easing</p>
<p>The trend of edible oil shows a slight easing. This is because more than 10,000 tins of raw oil blocked in the Jiangbei area can be transported to Shanghai within days, which makes people feel slightly uneasy, and the market shows a soft trend. It is planned to sell 10 buckets each of Qingdao raw oil and Dalian soybean oil, 100 dan of Qingyou from the Daya Factory, 100 dan of vegetable oil, 50 buckets of vegetable oil from the Rihua Factory, and 100 dan each of vegetable oil from the Taishan Coating Yoshida Factory.</p>
<h3>公債已有補進 外股杌隍不安</h3>
<p>Government bonds have been replenished, foreign stocks are unstable</p>
<p>In the gray market for government bonds, yesterday's market saw a slight rebound because of a relatively large decline in recent days, so some short sellers covered their positions. The market situation slightly improved. On one hand, long positions were sold, and on the other hand, short positions were covered. However, the market has looser access to funds, and money is becoming tighter. Banks only accept deposits and do not lend to those with excess funds, in order to avoid risks. Short sellers are even suffering from the difficulty of finding a place to write accounts. Ordinary foreign exchange rates are 1.2%, but it is still not easy to obtain. Government bonds are under this extremely unexpected pressure, and the outlook is not easy to be optimistic about. Yesterday morning, Class C bonds initially opened at 66.6 yuan, fell to 66.45 yuan, and then rebounded, actually breaking through the 7 yuan level. Hongda, Xinfeng, Yiji, and Runli bought on the floor, and Tongshun, Jiucheng, and Shuntai sold Class E bonds, also breaking through 7 yuan. Class A bonds also reached beyond 4 yuan, and Class B bonds also reached 9 yuan. The noon close was up several jiao to one yuan. In the afternoon, the bulls raised Class C bonds again, with high prices reaching 7.65 yuan. Yitai, Houde, and Tongxing bought, but Xiexing, Yuan Hongda, Runde, and Jiufeng sold off, then broke through 7 yuan again at closing. The market situation eventually rebounded by 2.5 to 7 jiao across the board. The total transaction volume was approximately 1.8 million yuan. A summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock transactions, 200 shares of Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory stock were traded at a price of 62 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks in the Public Concession continued to decline sharply, largely because the increasingly serious international disputes caused many to liquidate their holdings. However, there was no shortage of new buyers active at low prices, so the final decline was not significant. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>London, 29th (Wednesday) - Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far Eastern British companies' stocks were generally weak. HSBC Bank's British-registered shares continued to fall by half a pound, priced at 73 pounds. Hong Kong-registered shares fell by one pound, priced at 80 pounds. There were quotations but no transactions, and there were no other changes.</p>
<h3>棉布街銷獨旺</h3>
<p>Cotton cloth street sales are particularly strong</p>
<p>Yesterday's market trend for factory cloth was slightly soft, due to the sale of stockpiles for profit. However, because factory inventory remained tight, industry players took advantage of lower prices to buy, and the market turned firm again. Sales prices of coarse cloth fluctuated between 2.5 and 5 jiao, while some fine cloth twills fell by 5 jiao to 1 yuan. Bleached and dyed cloth was flat. Wholesale transactions in the street retail market were particularly strong, while customer sales remained bleak. The total transaction volume was over 800 pieces. Yihua's coarse cloth factory still opened a small amount of inventory, only offering 200 bales of this month's 9-pound Cat Eagle coarse cloth at a price of 64.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth initially fell and then rebounded. Because Shuangma fell to the daily limit at the opening, the spot market gradually declined. The top fine cloth factory's bid price fell to 87.7 yuan. Later, because the exchange price was firm, industry players on the street vigorously searched for lower prices. Mid-range miscellaneous fine cloth first rebounded by more than 1.5 yuan per bolt, so the leading factory also rebounded to 88.8 yuan at closing, a decrease of 7 jiao from the previous day. Dyed goods called Junzi Serge once fell to 3.178 yuan, but because the existing warehouse receipts were very tight, and firms came to buy, it rebounded to 3.22 yuan at closing.</p>
<h3>食糖先跌後漲</h3>
<p>Sugar prices initially fell and then rose</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market initially fell and then rose. As a result, the futures group rose by 3 to 4 yuan, and spot coarse white sugar rose by 3 yuan to 1 yuan. However, the price for June delivery fell by 1 yuan, Hong Kong sugar rose by 2.5 yuan, and Dutch red sugar rose by 1 yuan. The company's coarse white sugar futures only traded in the morning due to Wednesday. The opening price fell nearly 10 yuan to 236 yuan, and the closing price was 12 yuan. The highest price was 43 yuan, and the lowest was 36 yuan. Off-exchange trading was 13 yuan. The opening price for November 10 fell sharply by about 12 yuan to 247 yuan, and the closing price was 56 yuan. The highest price was the same, and the lowest was 47 yuan. Off-exchange trading was 95 yuan. The spot price for October delivery of No. 24 coarse white sugar was 250 yuan to 255.5 yuan, for September delivery it was 248.5 yuan to 252.3 yuan, for August delivery it was 246 yuan to 251 yuan, and for June delivery it was 242 yuan to 247 yuan. Dutch red sugar was 229 yuan to 231 yuan. Hong Kong coarse white sugar rose by a minimum of 220 yuan to 228 yuan, and HX brand army white sugar was 204 yuan. A total of more than 15,000 bags of futures were traded, and more than 12,000 bags of spot were traded.</p>
<h3>南貨海味暴騰</h3>
<p>Southern goods and seafood soar</p>
<p>Black fungus has been out of stock for a long time, and the market is extremely short, so the market price has risen sharply, increasing by 500 to 600 yuan before and after. As a result, firm prices have also increased accordingly.</p>
<p>Xianglian has recently been lacking in continued arrivals, so firms are hoarding their goods. In two or three days, the price has risen by another 30 jiao. Yesterday, Baochang opened 20 bags, and the sales price was increased by 50 yuan.</p>
<p>The rising trend of tapioca flour has revived recently. Yesterday, firm prices such as the Feilin brand rose to 195 yuan, the Lao Qilin brand was 160 yuan, the Double K brand was the same price, the Double T brand was 150 yuan, and the C brand was 130 yuan. Both large and small grain rice were 150 yuan.</p>
<p>Western dried goods are arriving in small quantities and continue to rise. Yesterday, Western dried goods rose to 460 yuan again.</p>
<h3>高圓肉逼近千元</h3>
<p>High-quality longan pulp is approaching 1,000 yuan</p>
<p>Because of the lack of stock of high-quality longan pulp, the market price has soared. The selling price of those with bright yellow color and dry body has approached 1,000 yuan. When a new batch of goods arrives, the market is still expected to rise.</p>
<h3>本釘倍司 二百七十元</h3>
<p>This nail beisi is 270 yuan</p>
<p>The hardware market has been severely shaken by the financial market in recent days, and the prices of various goods have risen by as much as 20% to 30%, resulting in quite chaotic price quotations. However, industry players are still reluctant to sell easily. The selling price is getting higher and higher. Yesterday, the price of this nail jumped from 255 yuan to 270 yuan due to the large-scale purchase by hoarders, and it was difficult to purchase a large batch at once. In addition, black iron billets are in extremely short supply in the market, and there is almost no supply.</p>
<h3>白煤限期將屆</h3>
<p>The deadline for white coal is approaching</p>
<p>—囤戶紛紛出籠—</p>
<p>Hoarders flock out</p>
<p>The price of white coal had been rising in the gray market in the previous week. However, as the deadline for warehouse receipts approached, the owners, realizing that it would be difficult to hoard for a long time, flocked out to sell at high prices. The available amount of coal suddenly became plentiful, supply exceeded demand, and prices could not be sustained and fell. Yesterday, the black market opened at 715 to 720 yuan, down 50 yuan from the previous Saturday. It is heard that a new shipment of 4,300 tons of Hongji white coal will be loaded and shipped within the month. Merchants are selling it, and the price is falling. The gray market will disappear on its own.</p>

<h3>運用抑平物價技術 組織進口商協會卅五家商行昨參與會議 所持政策與工部局一致昨晚局會後籌備實施管理零售方法</h3>
<p>Using techniques to suppress and stabilize prices: 35 trading houses participated in yesterday's meeting to organize an importers' association. The policies adopted were consistent with the Municipal Council. After the meeting last night, preparations were made to implement methods for managing retail sales.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council, recognizing that suppressing high prices requires the cooperation of major importers, convened a unprecedented meeting at 2 PM yesterday in the Council's meeting room, gathering representatives from 35 foreign import firms in Shanghai to plan the establishment of an importers' association and promote the effective implementation of the Council's price management plan. The decisions made at yesterday's meeting will be announced by the Council early next week. The Council's price management plan was initially announced orally by Director-General Felipe, followed by the official announcement of a formal notification on Monday last week, and a new supplementary rule was drafted and submitted to the Consular Body for approval. Although the supplementary rule is still under consideration by the Consular Body, the Council's determination to control prices is very clear. Following the request to the Stabilization Fund for foreign exchange needed for the import of wheat and the guarantee by the American director Mingside that there would be no panic about food supplies, the immediate planning to organize an importers' association clearly has special significance.</p>
<p>協會細則 殆已決定</p>
<p>The association's detailed rules are almost decided</p>
<p>In order to take unprecedented steps to prevent abnormal price increases in retail goods, the Municipal Council held a meeting yesterday afternoon for responsible individuals from 35 major foreign importers and manufacturers in the city. The purpose was to organize an importers' association. The meeting started at 2:15 PM in the Municipal Council's meeting room. Import firms such as Erlanhan Bailey Co., Ltd. (British, 110 Hankou Road, specializing in the import of pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and hospital supplies), Tianxiang Foreign Firm (British, 17 Guangdong Road, various import and export businesses), Haining Foreign Firm (American, manufacturing butter candy and other foods), and Dekang Foreign Firm (British, 33 Sichuan Road) all sent representatives to participate. According to an employee of one of the participating import firms, the Municipal Council had held multiple meetings before meeting with the importers, and planned to organize an importers' union to control high prices, but still considered this to be lacking. It is said that the Municipal Council had already distributed invitations last week to 35 foreign import firms and manufacturers, inviting them to participate in this meeting. The detailed rules for the establishment of the importers' association were almost decided at yesterday afternoon's meeting.</p>
<p>管理零售 疏通來源</p>
<p>Managing retail, smoothing supply</p>
<p>It is said that all the detailed rules for organizing the association are expected to be sorted out clearly within days. What resolutions were made at yesterday's meeting will be announced by the Municipal Council early next week. It is said that the importers' association's policies will be consistent with the notification issued by the Municipal Council last Monday. The Municipal Council stated that it has no intention of interfering with normal commercial trade, but necessary goods will flow out of Shanghai, but retail prices must be managed. According to another source, the main items discussed at yesterday's meeting of import firms were two: one was to effectively manage prices in the city and crack down on unreasonable price increases, and the other was to smooth the sources of various necessary goods, and to entrust reliable foreign import firms to engage in procurement and import, just like the rice policy, with the Municipal Council supplying and selling at flat prices.</p>
<p>昨日局會 籌備實行</p>
<p>Yesterday's council meeting, preparing for implementation</p>
<p>Although the Consular Body has not yet approved the new supplementary rules requested by the Municipal Council, the Council has been actively proceeding with organizing legal institutions and drafting various regulations. At the Council's regular meeting at 4:30 PM yesterday, general issues were reviewed, so that when the land charter supplementary rules are approved, methods can be announced and price management can be implemented. The Municipal Council plans to directly handle the transportation and sales of flour, coal balls, and cooking oil, which are all underway. The Coal Ball Price Evaluation Committee has been established for nearly two weeks. As a result of the discussions, coal balls will be sold at a uniform price of 19 yuan in national currency per city dan (110 pounds), including delivery, starting from the 28th. All retail stores must comply. It is learned that the Coal, Wood, and Charcoal Industry Union has received formal notification from the Committee and has immediately notified all members to comply. The Committee is actively working on the preparation of "standard coal balls," but it is learned that the Committee is not manufacturing these coal balls itself, but is still entrusting various coal ball merchants to raise funds and plan manufacturing. The Committee will only play a guiding role in the future. Various coal ball merchants have submitted lists of the composition and methods of manufacturing coal balls to the Committee, which will then submit them to the Municipal Council for research. Manufacturing will begin after the Municipal Council approves them, and they will be sold on the market. At that time, the selling price per dan will be lower than other types of coal balls.</p>
<p>滬市經濟 有待設計</p>
<p>Shanghai's economy needs to be designed</p>
<p>The English-language Financial and Commercial Weekly, published yesterday, wrote an article discussing the situation of rising prices in Shanghai, and strongly urged the Municipal Council to cooperate with importers as soon as possible based on the proposed new supplementary rules, and to do its best to draft a plan to build Shanghai's economy on a wartime basis. The Stabilization Fund Committee, due to its financial role, can indeed limit imports, but it can never control prices. If the Municipal Council can cooperate with importers, it can manage prices and, with great difficulty, adopt a new system to distribute supplies to merchants. If merchants do not comply with the regulations, the supply of materials will be cut off in the future, so that they cannot continue to operate. Under the major principle of maintaining Chinese legal tender, the Stabilization Fund will undoubtedly provide enthusiastic assistance to this matter.</p>
<h3>管理米價欲期有效 端在公衆合作勿預購過多致妨害供給 下月用米已有充分準備</h3>
<p>To effectively manage rice prices, public cooperation is key: do not pre-purchase too much to hinder supply. There is sufficient preparation for next month's rice.</p>
<p>After Dr. Mingside, the American director of the Municipal Council, met with reporters the day before yesterday and stated that the source of foreign rice for the Municipal Council would not be interrupted, the rumors that had been circulating in the rice market for days about the limited source of foreign rice were swept away, and speculators were unable to use their tricks. Yesterday, the price of rice at various stalls fell by five or six yuan. At the same time, after being informed by the authorities, the general public has also greatly reduced the trend of purchasing and storing rice. Yesterday, most rice shops in the two concessions resumed door-to-door sales because they had obtained foreign rice from the Municipal Council. However, the number of people buying rice was still very crowded.</p>
<p>實銷充裕</p>
<p>Actual sales are abundant</p>
<p>According to reporters, yesterday, Xiangmao Foreign Firm distributed a total of more than 7,000 bags of foreign rice from the Municipal Council to various rice shops, which is enough to meet the actual sales of rice shops throughout the city. According to rice shop owners, since the authorities temporarily stopped rice shops in Nanshi, Zhabei, and Huxi from purchasing foreign rice from the Municipal Council, the price of rice in those areas is even higher than in the concession area. As a result, small vendors compete to buy from rice shops in the concession area in order to make a profit. Although the amount purchased by each person each time is only about 2 dou, it makes it difficult for residents in the concession area to buy foreign rice from the Municipal Council. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities can stop this.</p>
<p>足供消費</p>
<p>Sufficient for consumption</p>
<p>According to Dr. Mingside, director of the Municipal Council, if the inventory of foreign rice sold at the prescribed price is only for the current consumption of citizens, the authorities can deal with the rice market with ease. It is said that if the public buys rice not for resale for profit or for storage, and can follow the regulations of the Municipal Council and not pre-purchase more than one month's worth of food, it will greatly help the price management measures implemented by the authorities, and the future of food for the people will never be scarce. It is also said that a large supply can be guaranteed in November, so there is no reason to panic. The foreign rice recently distributed by the Municipal Council to various rice shops is sufficient for the city's needs for one week, and residents of Nanshi and Zhabei can also be included.</p>
<p>供應原意</p>
<p>Original intention of supply</p>
<p>Regarding the fact that the price of foreign rice from the Municipal Council, which was originally set at 117 yuan, has been raised to 160 yuan in the rice market, Mr. Mingside pointed out that this is the result of speculation. If citizens buy more rice than they need, and some people hoard large quantities, once a large amount of rice enters the hands of hoarders, the inventory of rice shops will naturally be empty. In order to prevent rice and food from being transported out of the concession, the Municipal Council has strictly ordered detectives to pay attention. Mr. Ming also said that public cooperation is the weakest link in the chain of price management measures. Therefore, it is hoped that citizens can cooperate effectively and report speculation for profit by hoarders, so that the authorities can punish those who violate the law. If the public cannot recognize the management methods of the authorities and cannot comply with the regulations of the Municipal Council, the Stabilization Fund, which provides foreign exchange for the import of foreign rice, will be greatly disappointed. It is also learned that since the day before yesterday, a small number of rice shops have accepted the advice of the authorities and resumed selling flat-price Hong Kong rice and small-sized rice from public warehouses, but the paper signs issued by the Municipal Council have not yet been hung on the doors of these rice shops.</p>

No one may store or bottle more than 100 liters of gasoline without permission. In order to avoid serious dangers to residents, anyone who violates these regulations will be subject to the most severe penalties in accordance with the above-mentioned order.</p>

<p>Winter relief begins, making and distributing winter clothing, 13 yuan per set</p>
<p>As deep autumn arrives and the weather becomes colder, poor citizens are suffering from hunger and cold due to the impact of rising prices.

<h3>阿根廷貨輪首次來滬途中 拯救覆舟船員十一人攀附木板飄浮海上 船長瞥見疾駛赴援得更生</h3>
<p>Argentine cargo ship arrives in Shanghai for the first time, rescuing eleven shipwrecked crew members clinging to wooden planks floating at sea. The captain caught sight of them and rushed to rescue them, giving them new life.</p>
<p>The cargo ship Nord, which sailed from Argentina, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (28th) and is currently berthed at the Gonghexing Wharf in Pudong, carrying 30,000 bales of cotton ordered by a certain American merchant firm from Jardine Matheson. Nord is the first ship flying the Argentine flag to arrive in Shanghai. The ship departed from Santos, Brazil, 33 days ago on its maiden voyage. On Monday night, when the ship was sailing off Wenzhou, it saw eleven Chinese people clinging to wooden planks and floating at sea. The captain, Iskerai, immediately ordered the ship to rush closer and rescued the eleven people. According to the rescued people, they were sailing a sailboat carrying firewood and other timber from Wenzhou to Shanghai when they encountered bad weather and the sailboat capsized. Fortunately, they were rescued and brought to Shanghai on the ship.</p>
<h3>建設號挖泥船上 日憲兵未撤退</h3>
<p>Japanese military police have not withdrawn from the Jianshe dredger</p>
<p>Although the Jianshe, the large dredger of the Dredging Bureau, was requisitioned to Moji under the name of a lease, in reality, the Dredging Bureau still has many dredgers that have been seized by the Japanese and have not been returned. Once leased, no one dares to make a conclusion as to when it will be returned. Therefore, the return of the crew after being requisitioned is also very slim. The crew is very firm in their attitude based on the above-mentioned apprehension. It is found that one of the current directors of the Dredging Bureau is Mr. Sfu, the customs officer of the Jianghai Customs. Therefore, the crew hopes to be protected, dispel the Japanese attempt to requisition, and negotiate the release of the two Chinese crew members who were arrested. As of yesterday, the crew members still refused to go to the ship, and the Japanese military police are still waiting on the ship and have not withdrawn. The situation is still tense.</p>
<p>變更菜塲收攤時間</p>
<p>Change the closing time of the vegetable market</p>
<p>The French Concession Public Works Bureau posted a notice yesterday in various public and private vegetable markets within the concession, stating that the closing time of the winter vegetable market (11:00 AM) has been set to take effect from November 1st of this year (Saturday). All public and private vegetable markets must close before 11:00 AM from that day on, so that the cleaning agencies can immediately carry out cleaning and sweeping of the markets. [Pressing the French authorities originally stipulated that the business hours of the vegetable markets should be from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM in summer (April 1st to the end of September) and from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM in winter (October 1st to the end of March). This year, due to the implementation of daylight saving time, the new clock time is calculated. At the same time, daylight saving time has not been abolished, so the markets are still closed at 10:00 AM in October, and the closing time will be changed to 11:00 AM from next month.]</p>
<h3>Continued Report on the Two Major Fires: Significant Losses for Two Transportation Companies; Japanese Cotton Mill Also Burned Down</h3>
<p>Regarding the major fire at 423 Lane, Sichuan Road, Cichang Li, which occurred around 12:50 PM the day before yesterday, detailed in yesterday’s edition of this newspaper, it continued to burn for a considerable time. When reporters went to inspect the scene yesterday morning, there were still smoldering embers. Here is a continued report on the situation: Cichang Li on Sichuan Road consisted of very simple buildings, with over forty households and hundreds of residents. Many shops lined the area. The Quan Tai and Zhong Fa Transportation Companies occupied the most buildings, with over ten storefronts at No. 13. The warehouses contained large quantities of chemical goods such as soap, candles, and salted fish. The upper floors were rented out to various businesses. For unknown reasons, a fire suddenly broke out in the warehouse the day before yesterday afternoon. Because the stored goods were highly flammable, the fire quickly became uncontrollable. Although eleven fire engines worked hard to extinguish it, they could not contain the blaze. The fire spread to Nos. 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24 in the back lane. Among these, the Lao Ju Xing Restaurant at No. 20 was the first to be hit and was almost completely destroyed. The remaining houses were also dilapidated and uninhabitable. The victims were suddenly left without shelter and had nowhere to stay. Many temporarily resided on the ground near the lane. The situation was extremely miserable. The cause of the fire is currently unclear, and the losses are estimated at a massive four to five million. Furthermore, a major fire occurred in the Hongkou District the day before yesterday. All fire brigades in the Hongkou District mobilized to combat the blaze. The fire started at the Maofeng (transliterated) Cotton Mill, established by the Japanese, located at 750 Kunming Road. The value of cotton and machinery lost in the fire was over 800,000 yuan. Until yesterday (the 29th) morning, firefighters had not yet withdrawn. However, it is understood that the flames at the cotton mill were completely extinguished by the afternoon. The area affected by the fire was 175 feet long and 80 feet wide, and the roof was also burned down. Three water pumps were used during the firefighting efforts, with assistance from the Yangshupu Fire Brigade and the Japanese Marines.</p>
<p>Firefighting Martyrdom</p>
<p>During the Cichang Li fire, firefighter Yu Wenzhao (No. 590) bravely and selflessly charged forward to extinguish the flames. Unfortunately, due to the ferocity of the fire, he was overcome by smoke and fumes inside the warehouse and could not escape. Another firefighter risked entering the building to rescue him, but he was already unconscious. An ambulance rushed him to the Public Concession Hospital for treatment. Despite the doctors' best efforts, his injuries were too severe, and he passed away at 4:35 PM yesterday. It is said that the firefighter was very loyal and dedicated in his service. Due to his limited income, his family is now destitute. He leaves behind parents, a wife, and children. Upon hearing the news, people from all walks of life expressed their sympathy. It has been decided that the funeral will be held at the Paradise Funeral Home on tomorrow (the 31st).</p>
<h3>Kidnapping for Ransom: Zhou Rong and His Accomplices Arrested</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the French Concession police received a report that a three-year-old boy surnamed someone from No. 6, Lane 108, Shanzhong Road, had gone missing. After investigation, Zhou Rong (28 years old), who lived with the family, was suspected. Zhou Rong was unemployed and had been living in the boy's house for several months. On the day in question, someone saw him walking with the boy on the street. After questioning by the police, Zhou Rong confessed to hiding the boy in the home of his accomplices in Zhabei with the intention of demanding a ransom. Yesterday morning (the 29th), with the assistance of the Japanese military police, the boy was rescued. A man and a woman responsible for guarding him were also arrested.</p>
<p>Killing of Russian Prisoner Who Attempted Escape: Other Hidden Circumstances</p>
<p>Arrested for Planning to Join the Tegol Army; Attempted Escape Foiled; Violently Attacked Guard</p>
<h3>Other Hidden Circumstances: Arrested for Planning to Join the Tegol Army; Attempted Escape Foiled; Violently Attacked Guard</h3>
<p>This newspaper reported yesterday on the case of a Russian prisoner killing a Vietnamese guard at the French Concession's Lujiiawan Central Police Station on the afternoon of the 28th. The Zilin Newspaper provided more detailed information about the incident. According to reports, the Russian, named Korgreziv, was a Russian police officer in the White Russian Auxiliary Police Force of the French Police Department. He intended to join the Tegol Army and had applied to his superiors for resignation a few days prior. However, his request was denied, leading to a dispute. He was then accused of insubordination and detained in the guardhouse of the Auxiliary Police Force. On the morning of the 28th, he escaped when another Russian officer opened the door. He fled along Luban Road towards Foch Road but was caught and taken to the Central Police Station jail in the French Concession. Around 3:00 PM on the same day, the Russian officer pretended to need to use the restroom. When the Vietnamese guard opened the door, he attacked the guard. A struggle ensued. The Russian officer, being stronger, repeatedly slammed the Vietnamese guard's head against the iron bars of the cell, causing fatal skull fractures. However, the Russian officer still failed to escape. It is rumored that an investigation will be conducted into the death of the Vietnamese guard.</p>
<h3>Yulin Road Police Station Uncovers Human Trafficking Ring; Arrests Multiple Male and Female Suspects; Rescues Five Girls; Investigation Ongoing</h3>
<p>The Yulin Road Police Station received an anonymous letter stating that a human trafficking ring was operating at No. 48, Lane 412, Helin Li, Yulin Road. The ring specialized in luring girls from the Ningbo area to Shanghai for sale. This operation had been ongoing for two years, and dozens of girls had been trafficked. Detectives Han Tongfu, Song Shimin, Wu Wenfa, and others investigated and confirmed the information. They arrested Ningbo native Ni Nengwei (a blind man) and a 14-year-old boy, He Lihai. They rescued an eight-year-old girl, Mao Yudi. They then proceeded to 503 Yangshupu Road and arrested Changre native Ma Yigen. At No. 52, Lane 412, Yulin Road, they arrested Ningbo native Ye Fukang. At No. 80 Fulan Road, they arrested Zhang Tongfa. At No. 85, Dean Li, North Shansi Road, they arrested Ningbo woman Ni Changshi. They also rescued five girls, including 14-year-old Ni Yin Xue, 10-year-old Jin Mei, 8-year-old Chang'e, and 10-year-old Ai Zhen, at various locations. All were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated the case, saying that the defendants specialized in luring girls from Ningbo to Shanghai for sale and profit, totaling dozens of people. He requested detention because further investigation was needed. The five rescued girls, without families, were temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute. When questioned, Ni Nengwei confessed that all the girls were brought to Shanghai from Ningbo because his family could not make a living, so he sold them. Judge Zhong verified the confession and ordered Ni and others to be detained for a further hearing on November 12. The girls were sent to the Jiliang Institute for temporary custody.</p>
<h3>Contention Over Hardoon's Estate Intensifies: Complex Inside Story Emerging</h3>
<p>Litigation Inevitable</p>
<p>(Continued from Yesterday) The discovery of the second will is also of interest. Two days before his death, Rhodes told his fourth son, Youqi, that there was an important item in the silver box, without specifying that it was a will. Although Youqi immediately retrieved the item, it is said that he was in no hurry to open it. It was only later that he learned it was a will. According to people involved in the case, Rhodes' adopted sons and daughters planned to announce the will after the seventh day of mourning following Rhodes' funeral. However, because lawyer Laird requested a reply before the 19th, they had to announce it earlier as evidence. It is claimed that Rhodes' Chinese children believe that the second will is the authentic will and that they are willing to comply with the will, donating some real estate to public welfare organizations and distributing the remainder according to the will. They do not want George to use lawyer Laird to illegally manipulate the estate. Given the current situation, litigation between the two sides seems very likely. However, it is claimed that George still intends to reconcile and settle the matter peacefully. However, because the first and second wills are so different, the dispute is bound to escalate. According to reports, George was expelled by Luo Jialing for improper behavior and sent to the Civilian Training Institute in western Shanghai. After the war, when operations were suspended, his father sent him to Beihu. In 1939, George returned from Peiping. Through the mediation of lawyer Laird, he was allowed to return to Aili Garden. It is found that Luo Jialing has eight Chinese descendants, five sons and three daughters, with Youlan being the eldest. Besides George's great efforts regarding the estate, the other eight foreign descendants are said to have a very indifferent attitude.</p>
<p>Hardoon &amp; Co. Business Suspended</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that the difficulty of this estate dispute lies in two factors: first, the authenticity of the two wills, and second, the issue of nationality. Will this case be handled by the British High Court or by the First Special District Court? According to those who favor Luo Youlan, Rhodes' Chinese children believe that there are many misunderstandings about Rhodes and hope that the second will can be implemented so that public welfare organizations can benefit, and Rhodes' achievements can be immortalized. As for the two guardians, Ji Juemi and Yapala, they did not attend when Laird took the silver box because it was the Jewish New Year. After this incident, both of the two parties hired legal counsel separately, and the latter's counsel due to Hardoon &amp; Co. files were sealed and the keys also were taken away, so that there was no official business to do, Hardoon &amp; Co. business has been suspended in the intangible manner, So far, it can be seen that the line of array of both sides in this dispute is very clear,</p>
<p>Contention Intensifies; No Precedent</p>
<p>In addition to the two opposing forces headed by George and Luo Youlan mentioned above, there are two other parties who also want to get involved in Rhodes' vast estate of 80 million yuan. One is a group of ten people claiming to be close relatives of the late Hardoon, living in Baghdad (Hardoon's original hometown) and here, demanding 65.2 percent of Hardoon's estate. They have also commissioned a British lawyer, Jones, in Shanghai to file a warning lawsuit with the British High Court, intending to overturn Luo Jialing's will. It is found that the ten people claiming to be Hardoon's relatives requested a division of the estate from Luo Jialing even before Rhodes' death. At that time, the ten people commissioned Japanese lawyer Okamoto Yi Yi to send a letter to Luo Jialing requesting a division of the estate. Luo Jialing ignored it. After Rhodes' death, they changed their request to British lawyer Jones to file a lawsuit with the British court. However, there has been no progress in this dispute. The lawsuit to verify the will is extremely complicated, and there is no precedent in Shanghai or even in Britain.</p>
<h3>Huang Yuqi Shot: Injuries Not Serious; Huizhong Business as Usual</h3>
<p>Since the shooting of Huizhong Bank Manager Huang Yuqi a few days ago, all sectors have shown great concern and sent letters and telegrams of condolence. It has been learned that Huang's injuries are only in his left arm and left leg. After surgery, the bullets have been removed, and his condition is very good. His life is not in danger. Rumors that he was injured in the chest and abdomen are not true. As for the assailant, Huang Donghai, because of his foot injuries, he must be treated before he can be interrogated, so the case is still unclear. It is heard that Mr. Huang has moved to another place for recuperation yesterday. The business operations of Huizhong Bank's main and branch banks are as usual.</p>
<h3>Public Memorial for Qin Zhonghuan Tomorrow: Tragic Life; Still Lacking Burial Expenses; Hoping for Contributions from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Qin Zhonghuan, an employee of the Dazhong News Agency, passed away on the 18th due to injuries. This month, the 31st, marks the second week since his death. His family and friends believe that Mr. Qin died for his country. He was placed in a coffin at the Continental Funeral Home on Hague Road on the 19th, but no memorial service could be held. Therefore, it has been decided to hold a public memorial service at Longxing Temple, across from the Nanjing Grand Theatre on Aiduya Road, from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM this afternoon. Mr. Qin was alone, and the medical and funeral expenses were fortunately covered by a grant of 2,000 yuan from those responsible. However, after expenses, there is no money left. His coffin must be transported back to his hometown of Changzhou, and the coffins of his parents have not yet been buried. All of this requires money. The Dazhong News Agency, due to soaring prices, has difficulty even with daily support and has no funds to spare. Therefore, they hope that all parties can contribute to this righteous cause to comfort the spirit of the deceased. Those who wish to donate funeral gifts should send them to the Zhengyan News Agency. Donations received so far include: Mr. Pu, 10 yuan; Mr. Hu, 10 yuan; Mr. Cai, 10 yuan.</p>

All eight robbers were armed with pistols. They first drove all the family members in the house into a room and locked them up, then began searching, overturning boxes and chests. They stole gold and silver jewelry and cash worth over 15,000 yuan, then shouted and rushed out the door, carrying the loot and fleeing without a trace. Afterwards, the victim reported the incident to the police in charge, requesting an investigation and arrest.</p>

<h3>Wartime Economic Controls Lead to Cultural Crisis for Overseas Chinese in Malaya; Supply of Shanghai Books Cut Off; Hong Kong Editions Also Restricted</h3>
<p>(Singapore Airmail) The culture and education of overseas Chinese in Malaya has always been closely connected to the motherland. Not only are the textbooks in schools, but all reference books rely on the mainland, especially Shanghai, for supply. Major bookstores in Shanghai, such as the Commercial Press, China Bookstore, World Bookstore, and Shanghai Bookstore, all have branches in Singapore. They import books from the mainland and then distribute them to cities and towns in Malaya. Before the war, the value of books imported from the mainland each year was 280,000 to 290,000 yuan. Although this number is still not as high as the 300,000 yuan for "joss paper" each year, since the Malayan government implemented wartime economic policies last year, the import of all goods has been restricted. The import of books from the mainland to Malaya has decreased from 280,000 to 290,000 yuan to a quota of 20,000 yuan per year, a decrease of 70%. In July of this year, Malaya implemented new material controls, and the import of all printing paper was restricted or prohibited. However, the joss paper used for superstitious purposes, due to the recommendation of the Chinese Advisory Board, is still allowed to be imported by one-third, which is still 100,000 yuan per year, five times the import of books. Cultural figures have long been concerned about the culture and education of overseas Chinese in Malaya. Since the United States and Britain froze Japanese and Chinese funds, it has been even more difficult to remit money to Shanghai to purchase books. For the past two months, Shanghai has not shipped any new books to Singapore. Books published in Hong Kong, which were not restricted in the past, are now also restricted. A request for an AP (i.e., import quota permit) is required for the import of books. The old permit allowed an import of 20,000 yuan, but now it is only 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. More than a dozen bookstores here are feeling distressed. Although the import of school textbooks is wider, supplementary reading materials and reference books are still in short supply. The registration for requesting the purchase of textbooks for import is extremely strict. Import permits are divided into categories such as history, geography, and arithmetic. History import permits are limited to history textbooks and cannot be used for geography or other textbooks. Therefore, it is very difficult to make the supply and demand of textbooks correspond.</p>
<h3>National Southwest Associated University Resumes Autumn Semester as Scheduled After Being Heavily Bombed by Japanese Aircraft; Mei Yi-qi Delivers a Precise and Alarming Report; Classes Officially Begin on October 6</h3>
<p>(Kunming Airmail) The National Southwest Associated University was bombed on Air Force Day, August 14. The school headquarters, located on both sides of the Daxidou Outer Highway, suffered significant damage. The main reference library, the standing committee office, the teaching affairs office, the training department office, the general affairs office, the dormitory, classrooms, and the biology laboratory were all either completely collapsed or seriously damaged. A total of more than 70 bombs of various sizes were dropped on the school. Fortunately, most of the large bombs landed in gaps, and those that hit buildings were mostly small bombs. Therefore, the loss of books, stationery, instruments, clothing, and food was not significant. In the past month or so, through the efforts of the school staff, the post-disaster trauma has been completely repaired. Today, the buildings are all new again, and the school authorities' original schedule for the start of school and classes can be held as scheduled, and music will continue. On September 29 and 30, registration for the second, third, and fourth grades will take place. The students from the Xuyong branch school have already set off one after another. Now, eighty or ninety percent of them have arrived in Kunming. The total number of registered students in the school is close to 2,000. On October 1st and 2nd, course selection will take place. Classes will officially begin on the 6th. At 8:00 AM that morning, all teachers and students will gather to hold an opening ceremony and the October National Monthly Meeting. Mei Changwei Yiqi will deliver a brief and alarming report. According to him, since the school was bombed on August 14, students speculated that since the school buildings were severely damaged, classes would definitely not start as scheduled, and at the earliest would be in early December. Students left in Kunming were not only negligent themselves but also wrote to students who had returned home to tell them of this kind of "smart" speculation, preventing them from returning to school on time. This kind of mentality is really unacceptable. The investigation revealed that 27 planes came to bomb the school, dropping nearly 100 bombs. The consumption of gasoline and ammunition was at least 1 million yuan. Ask yourselves, is the loss of our school buildings this number? Absolutely not, this can be answered with great certainty. Now, the opening day of another year of our studies is here. I hope that we will all do it with a new spirit. During the long summer vacation, based on the needs of various social organizations, it is willing to absorb college students to participate in and promote some of the work. In terms of the students' finances, we really need a small amount of money to purchase books, stationery, clothing, and everything else, so the students' summer social service is really a very good thing. Now that school has started, I hope that you will study hard and put all your energy into studying academic theories to ensure that after four years of school training, society can increase a batch of knowledgeable and thoughtful cadres. We must not forget that the students' duty is to study academics. It is not easy for you to enter the Associated University. From a certain point of view, we can regard the fact that society is recruiting college students with high salaries, unlimited working hours, and convenient conditions as a kind of "enticement". We should be practical and down-to-earth. Read when you study, and you don't have to worry about not having opportunities to serve after graduation. The second thing I want to report is that we should encourage each other with the word honesty. Honesty means not deceiving. It is easy to say the two things of not deceiving yourself and not deceiving others, but it is difficult to do. But if you are determined to do it, it is not a troublesome thing. The ceremony ended at 9:00 AM. Classes will start at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The class hours are still from 7:00 to 10:00 in the morning and from 3:00 to 6:00 in the afternoon, 40 minutes per class. The library is open all day, so there is no problem with self-study. The National Southwest Associated University held two entrance examinations for freshmen. One was to participate in the joint entrance examination of the four universities. 700 to 800 people applied for the examination. On October 1, a separate examination was held, with more than 400 applicants. The results are being assessed. The results will not be announced. It is said that the first grade is still attending classes in Kunming, avoiding the labor of traveling. The Xuyong branch school has been cancelled, and a batch of pre-college students will be attending classes in Xuyong.</p>

<h3>Announcement of Selected Essays (8): The Leg</h3>
<p>— Fang Xiaolan</p>
<p>—I Learned a Lesson—</p>
<p>Whenever it is cloudy or rainy, my right leg feels a slight discomfort. It's not exactly sore, and it's certainly not painful, but it's just a bit unnatural. This feeling is really unpleasant. When was the last time you remembered that you had a right leg? You do your work, you walk your path, and no matter what, you wouldn't particularly remember a leg, but it makes me unable to forget it.</p>
<p>However, one can't always remember their own leg! Just like when you eat, you can't always remember your own mouth opening and closing. Otherwise, it would be too awkward.</p>
<p>But, leg, leg, how can I not forget a leg?</p>
<p>Time crawls back along memory, back to a glorious past, a past with a king's crown.</p>
<p>At that time, people didn't call me by my name, but called me the King of Soccer. You should also know how great the King of Soccer was at a certain time.</p>
<p>The King of Soccer himself knew his greatness even better. Even in his dreams, he heard cheers and praises. The environment cultivated my pride, and pride in turn blossomed and bore fruit, breeding more pride—and also breeding misfortune.</p>
<p>It was during the New Year holiday, I think. The school was so quiet that you could even hear the sound of sparrows flapping their wings clearly. There were only three or five people in the hundred-acre campus. Because those who had families in Shanghai went home, and those who didn't went to Shanghai to play and wander around. Because I caught a cold and had a slight fever, I was lying in bed resting, looking at the ceiling and thinking. I even ate lunch in bed. After one o'clock in the afternoon, A-Fang from the third floor came down to chat.</p>
<p>A-Fang also loved soccer as much as I did, so we were soccer brothers. At that time, he was upset about something (you know, young people inevitably get involved in romance, so they inevitably have some troubles), so he locked himself in his room and vented his anger at the walls. After half a day, he probably vented enough, so he came down to complain.</p>
<p>After talking for a while, I suggested going to play soccer to get the blood flowing and clear my mind. He said I had a fever, so I should lie down. But the King of Soccer never believed that a fever could stop him from playing soccer. I jumped out of bed, put on my shoes, and ran outside with the ball. I kicked it as soon as I lifted my foot, running around the field with the ball, full of vigor! The birds in the trees were also chirping with applause. Fever? What fever did I have?</p>
<p>A-Fang also came out. But I deliberately teased him, and with a fancy move, I left him behind. I dribbled the ball around the field, and he tried to block me, but could the King of Soccer ever fail?</p>
<p>The hand of fate is cruel, and it loves to tease those who are most proud. In that unfortunate second, I fell. To be precise, I was tripped by the ball; the King of Soccer was tripped by the ball. And I fell to the ground and couldn't get up.</p>
<p>The surgeon came, and the white car with the red cross came. I—the King of Soccer—was carried onto a stretcher and into the car. Because they said my right leg was broken.</p>
<p>Lying in the hospital bed, looking at the ceiling, I thought for two months: one should not be too willful and should learn to restrain oneself.</p>
<p>After leaving the hospital, everything was as usual. The difference was that whenever it was cloudy or rainy, I always remembered my own leg. So time crawled back once, twice... back to a glorious past...</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Thoughts</p>
<h3>"I Also Love a Ghost"</h3>
<p>— Jin Rumo</p>
<p>If I can't sleep at night, I can't help but think wildly. When the light is turned off, the room is pitch black, so I feel a little scared, so I think of ghosts, so I think of ghost operas in the newspaper, and also being able to have a romance with a ghost. I haven't seen the opera, so I don't know how the romance works, but if the thought is not right, I can't help but think: what if a ghost fell in love with me?</p>
<p>Wouldn't this be both scary and interesting? It would be like the beautiful ghosts in advertisements or stories like Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio, just as beautiful, but if you knew she was a ghost, you couldn't help but think of the images in books like the Jade Record Precious Book, with disheveled hair, claws, and tongues sticking out. If a change happened, someone as timid as me would inevitably love her from afar. Sometimes I also complain that the ancients were too scary. Although science is developed, ghosts are still scary. It's better not to know she's a ghost and just love her. It's also good to only find out after the ghost dies. But if you don't know, it's also boring. It's hard to have a romance with a ghost.</p>
<p>But then I suddenly feel that ghosts are cute. They can leisurely transcend the world and be independent. They can have whatever they want. Money comes with a wave of the hand. That's the best. If not, being able to not have any mundane concerns, not talking about wine, salt, sauce, vinegar, not talking about rice and coal, just having a spiritual romance would also be refreshing. Such a romance is certainly good, but I think it's not easy. The price of joss paper ingots is rising, and I don't know what the cost of living is like in the underworld. To have such a romance, you need a rich ghost to talk to. Thinking like this, I think the female ghosts in the Jade Record Precious Book are more lovable. Although they have disheveled hair and sticking tongues, red eyes and green hair, they still have something to be admired for: they have clear gratitude and grudges, clear likes and dislikes. They are not shy, they do not deceive, good is good, bad is bad, they kill you with one finger. Enmities in the human world must be avenged even after death. Guts!</p>
<p>This kind of thinking is ultimately a killjoy. The object of love is difficult to determine, and thoughts become more and more chaotic. From Chinese ghosts, I think of foreign ghosts. I remember that Guo Guoli's novels often write about ghosts avenging the living and venting anger for the dead. They are indeed very cute. Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio seems powerless in comparison. Therefore, I have found a point, which is: if a ghost is lovable, it's not because she has no mundane concerns and can float ethereally, but because she has clear likes and dislikes, dares to be angry, dares to scold, dares to cry, dares to laugh.</p>
<p>This is certainly the best, but I'm still a little worried. Ghosts can often transform. A beautiful woman can transform into a fanged monster. However, when I close my eyes and think about it, a person's face is not easy to determine. A gentleman's facade, a villain's face, it's just a matter of an instant. A certain philosopher said: "I have traveled the world and have not seen a person." This is a philosophical saying, but I hope it's not referring to these "invisible" people. At this moment, I have the suspicion of praising ghosts and monsters, advising people to love ghosts. This is an incredible story, so my love for ghosts can only end in heartbreak.</p>
<p>The east is dawning, and today I have to be a muddled "person" again.</p>
<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>The Revelation of the Fable</h3>
<p>— Cao Ercang</p>
<p>After the V-for-Victory movement, a fable became popular in Europe. The main idea of the fable is that, by chance, Mr. Hitler, Mr. Mussolini, and Mr. Churchill went to the fortune teller to ask about who would win this victory. This smart fortune teller did not say anything like foretelling the future. He only took two bowls—one empty and the other filled with water containing a small fish. He told them that whoever caught the fish alive would win the final victory. Mr. Hitler was impatient and didn't think before acting, so he splashed water all over the ground and retreated in embarrassment. Mr. Mussolini was a rough fellow, circling around the table and thinking aimlessly. In the end, of course, Mr. Churchill won! He used a container to transfer the water into another empty bowl and then pinched the small fish with his fingers.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the fable itself is flawless. Because it tells us about three types of people: one is a boastful, reckless barbarian, one is a stupid and impulsive boor, and the other is a smart person with rational judgment.</p>
<p>Just pondering these three types of people is enough to teach us a lesson.</p>
<p>Essays</p>
<h3>Shanghai People</h3>
<p>— Hou Fang</p>
<p>From the many places I've been to, I see Shanghai as the worst place, a place where "you only see the clothes, not the person."</p>
<p>In Southeast Asia, people with millions are often working barefoot. They are hard-working entrepreneurs. In Shanghai, people with fancy cars and horses may be entrepreneurs, but they are mostly speculative entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Barefoot people donate to the motherland very enthusiastically. They want to vent their national spirit.</p>
<p>People with fancy cars and horses are reluctant to donate to the country, but they are also used to being subjected to national humiliation.</p>

<h3>Bent Wood</h3>
<p>— Yongyun</p>
<p>When you see the things in the picture bent into various shapes, would you believe they are wood? But they are indeed wood, but only at 22 degrees Fahrenheit can they be bent at will, and they return to normal after cooling. The method of making this kind of wood is probably to first soak it in a urea solution until one of the substances in the wood combines with it. This kind of wood will definitely have many uses in the future, such as making airplane bodies, car bodies, ships, etc.</p>

<p>Fourteen. The Life of a Fallen Hero</p>
<p>Although Qiu Haitang learned to thank the stage manager like Mr. Qian, he felt more miserable than death. After just a dozen years, the situation was completely reversed! Eighteen years ago, he was like a diamond, everyone wanted him; now, he was not even worth a broken piece of copper, and he had to go through so much trouble just to join the supporting cast.</p>
<p>"Boss Wu, you have to think more positively! When people get old, they become less valuable. Isn't that how all opera singers are?" Mr. Qian was a very kind and enthusiastic person. Seeing his troubled look, he hurried to comfort him in every way. "Not only you opera singers, but also those of us who work at newspaper offices, we're no good after we turn fifty! It's no use worrying now. I hope the situation will be peaceful, and you and your daughter..."</p>
<p>Speaking to this point, he suddenly swallowed and tilted his head to think for a moment.</p>
<p>"Ah! Boss Wu, your daughter must be over ten years old this year, right? I didn't ask if she could..."</p>
<p>Before Qian Ruomo could continue, Qiu Haitang understood.</p>

<h3>Anna May Wong Stars in "Beautiful Moon"</h3>
<p>— Jun Yi</p>
<p>Screenplay by Lin Yutang... Produced by MGM</p>
<p>This unforgettable Chinese-American movie star, Anna May Wong, hasn't been on the screen for a long time recently. Because she joined a dance academy in Chicago this spring as a dance researcher, with a weekly salary of two thousand four hundred US dollars. This treatment can be said to be quite generous. Recently, news came that in order to highlight the heroic achievements of her motherland in the four years of courageous fighting, she will once again join the film studio to star in a film alone.</p>
<p>The script is "Beautiful Moon" by Chinese-American writer Lin Yutang. The copyright of this play has been purchased by a bookstore in New York. The content describes an incomparably heroic story in the process of Chinese nation-building. Because Hollywood hasn't made a film about China for a long time, MGM decided to put this work on the screen. Ms. Anna May Wong was hired to play the protagonist of this film. The co-stars are George Mauphan and another Chinese actor, Wang Zhenghan (transliteration). Filming began earlier this month and is expected to be completed in February next year.</p>
<p>According to MGM production staff, in addition to setting aside a portion of the profits from the film to be donated to the Aid China Relief Fund initiated by the Mayor of New York, a copy of the film will be donated to the Chinese government on International Women's Day next year. If this is realized, then the sensation of the film can be predicted.</p>

<h3>Art Scene in the Provisional Capital</h3>
<p>— He Yi</p>
<p>The art scene in Chongqing in October is quite vibrant. Three large and strong theater groups are putting on competitive performances. The Zhonghua Juyi Society, newly organized under the leadership of Ying Yunwei, is performing "Spring Returns to the Earth"; the China Wansui Theater Group is performing "Autumn on the Path," performed by Ma Yanxiang Dao. Cao Yu's new work, "Beijingers," was premiered by a theater group on October 14.</p>
<p>While in Chongqing researching international issues, Cui Wanqiu also edits the "Qingguang" weekly of the Shishi Xinbao and the "National Diplomacy" of the Guomin Gongbao. Recently, he is also preparing to run the "Objective" bi-monthly magazine with Sun Shiyi and Chen Liting, specializing in reviewing dramas and films, and the frequency is not reduced compared to normal years. "Objective" welcomes contributions from Shanghai writers. The mailing address is c/o Shishi Xinbao, and it is said that the remuneration is quite generous.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Cun Ren</p>
<p>Meng Xiaodong of the next generation of Huangjin only fills the position for him on a weekly basis to make adjustments, and Bai Yuwei is also partnering with Meng. Gai Jiaotian is invited to perform for half a month within the year, and the first period in the spring has already been assigned to Ma Lianliang and Li Yuru, etc.</p>
<p>When Li Chun of Tianchan took the stage, the reserved seats in the front row were priced at eight yuan per person.</p>
<p>Kun Dan Zhao Wanshuang is still in Shanghai, learning from Furongcao every day, and will soon be invited to perform in Qingdao.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain Qiongpa</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>"If Shen Baoxu hadn't borrowed troops from Qin at that time, then Chu would have been destroyed. Now that our military strength is insufficient, and we are afraid that the Qing soldiers will be behind us, attacking us from both sides, why doesn't the general ask for help from the Qing, imitating the story of Shen Baoxu? If the Qing monarch can embrace the purpose of rescuing disasters and caring for neighbors, and help us recover Yanjing and eliminate the roving bandits, then we will repay their kindness and gratitude by ceding the land outside Shanhaiguan to the Qing at most. The two countries will reconcile and each secure its own borders. Wouldn't that be good?" Wu Sangui listened to Fang Xianting's plan to ask for help from the Qing and pondered for a long time, then said, "The Manchus and I are hereditary enemies. I don't know if they will agree to let us borrow troops? There is another thing to consider: what if they refuse to withdraw their troops after entering the Pass?" Fang Xianting said, "We only need to borrow their troops to attack the roving bandits together. After defeating the roving bandits and recovering Yanjing, we will no longer need them. We can reward their army with heavy gold and ask them to withdraw from Shanhaiguan. They will get gold and silver and land. Why wouldn't they be happy to do it? If they refuse to withdraw their troops, we can resist them after destroying the roving bandits. As long as our own military strength is strong, with the size of China, why fear a single Manchuria?" Wu Sangui happily said, "What you said is correct. Now this is the only way. We must first defeat the roving bandits and then plan to deal with the Qing soldiers. I must trouble you to draft a letter, and I will write a letter to send someone to try it out." Fang Xianting obeyed and withdrew, and immediately wrote a letter asking for help, addressed to Dorgon, the regent of the Qing Dynasty. Then he presented it to Sangui for review. The letter said: (205)</p>
