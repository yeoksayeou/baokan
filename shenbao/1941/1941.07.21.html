<p>社評</p>
<h3>一月來之蘇德戰事與世界</h3>
<p>蘇德間的戰爭，到明晨恰滿一月。爲了爭奪這現代歷史中最重要的一頁，雙方都調集了空前的軍力，以全力從事；截至此際爲止，雖雙方戰報互易，陣地情况也極形錯雜，不可否認的德軍在慘重代價之下確屬有所進展，使莫斯科列髯格勒與基輔三重鎭都遭受着嚴重的威脅。德軍於美奇萊夫與維特白斯克之間突破蘇軍防綫之後，已深入佔領了斯摩倫斯克，進脅蘇聯的首都；蘇方則一方竭力堵截，一方襲擊德軍的後路，雙方繼續展開慘烈的大戰。但即以德軍最前突出點的斯摩倫斯克而言，距離蘇聯本土疆界不過二百哩，德軍這一血戰的成績比較日本軍隊之於淞滬戰爭固遠形優勝，以視去夏在西綫之於四十餘日間迫使荷比和法蘭西相繼潰敗投降者已形遠遜；更何况在若干地帶兩軍陣地犬牙相錯，德軍迄尙未把蘇軍完全逼退到蘇聯舊疆以內，納粹旣未能一舉包圍殲滅蘇方主力有如去歲之於法國那樣，則這種孤軍突入的戰略無髯到是一種過大的冒險。蘇聯於分別任命西綫三主要戰區主將而後，斯達林並自兼國防委員長，集黨政軍事於一身。事權愈見集中，指揮亦當更形便捷，預料其在保衛莫斯科的大戰中必能表現宏偉的抗力和靱性。納粹不只六星期之內無去擊敗蘇聯，且隨着時日的推移，必致困驗難愈增，進度愈緩，如此拖延下去，其未來命運是非常難料的。</p>
<p>蘇德戰爭自然是目前世界大局的重心，而且是世人注意的集中點，，但此一戰爭的前途一定是長期的消耗戰，姑不論莫斯科的形勢絕不像去夏巴黎之陷於無救，退一步講，即使蘇聯西疆的通都大邑都不幸陷落，也並不是納粹的決定勝利。早在幾年以前，蘇聯已把國防輕重工業的中心移到烏拉山脈以東，在經常的艱苦經營之下已有應付長期抗戰的充分準備。就目前戰局形勢來看：德軍不顧攻堅之忌，一味在中路推進，其在烏克蘭基輔一路則迄無重大進和油庫是不會完整的落到納粹手中的。假如說希特勒之突然攻蘇是爲了資源不給急求補充，則可斷定其攻蘇即使倖勝，所願必難獲遂。在這一戰爭拖延的過程中，納粹犧牲消耗當極重大，另一方面，也就是給予民治國家以更多的準備充實機會，可信不久英國的作戰力定與納粹達到平衡，世人所跂翹以俟的反攻問題亦可能見諸事實。</p>
<p>在這一月當中，國際形勢的演進雖稍迂緩，其趨勢却値得樂觀。第一，英蘇同盟成立，在互助之外並相互保證不在中途與納粹言和，這大槪是最出乎希特勒意料外的打是因爲侵略者的暴戾恣睢絕無止境而告實現了。連日蘇聯對於英美以外的共抗納粹各國亦已一改前此冷酷淡漠的態度，相繼樹立了外交關係，而且即如對蘇具有領土糾紛的波蘭，亦復在英國斡旋之下強調着蘇波調整關係的必要。第二，大西洋形勢空前好轉，過去一月中英輪喪失的數量在開戰以來殆爲最小，英方的艦艇已有餘力從事襲擊軸心方面的船隻。美國佔領氷島後，對英的戰具供應也有了重大的保障。即使這僅只是暫時現象，其所裨益於英方實力之增强者已絕非淺鮮。第三，英軍乘此時機肅靑東非，反攻巴迪亞。鞏固了中東的外圍，尤其是叙利亞戰事的順利結束，不只從此土耳其態度不虞反則，即對於英蘇共司保衛高加索與波斯灣問題亦有重大的意義。第四，日內閣因外交失敗而改組，繼起者固然是軍事法西斯的備戰內閣，其於軸心盟約則顯然更趨觀望，以是竟引起德方失望的表示，而在民治國方面，雖表面上對遠東備極鎭靜，然而外弛內張，A，B，C，D，陣綫的密切合作已構成了對於侵略企圖的嚴密戒備，現在英美輿論對於日新閣已不似初時之樂觀，大都認識了其內在的嚴重含義，連日英方標示運的主張，美國黑單的準備，哈里法克斯警告的言論，美當局緊急會議的召集，都正是針對着遠東這一待時而動的危機醞釀，</p>
<p>綜上所述，可見不論蘇德戰事如何變化，國際形勢的趨勢總是向著明朗方面發展。侵略者自從十年以前燃起野火以來，以今天纔初次遇到國際聯合力量的堅強阻遏；這一個月中的演變，即使還未能盡滿人意—有如聯合陣綫進行的迂緩，以至對於遠東危局仍有不正確認識的殘存，然而在大體上，已經是爲反侵略戰爭的勝利前途奠定了勝利的基礎。</p>
<h3>國共摩擦即可消弭　中央促共黨憬悟　合力對外並無征討之意　周恩來以書面籲請團結</h3>
<p>重慶　路透社間聞諸權威方面、中政府並無征討共產軍之意、其所以宣布共產軍挑募行為者、在下述理由、（一）自新內軍事件後、共產軍在過去數月內屢在各陣綫攻擊中央軍、而中央軍則奉有不得採取報復行動之命令、（二）希望中國共產黨與政府合作、如英美之共產當然，但中國共產黨不此是圖、反而加強其陰險活動、中政府專書民電致朱德、盼望共產黨制止其仇敵行動、今此項宣布、當可使此事實為世人所共知、庶世界與情、可轉移中國共產黨之態度、（二日路透社電）</p>
<p>官方制止糾紛擴大</p>
<p>重慶　國民黨與共產黨間之摩擦一、本日已在此間明白公開、官方一亦發表情報、叙述第十八集團軍與中央軍衝突之經過、同時共黨某正式發言人對於衝突事件、表示懷疑、並發表團結對日作戰之呼籲、政府官員同時亦採取相當步驟、以免摩擦在此間發展、並請求各報紙對此事勿發表評論、俾政府有較多之機會、以解決糾紛、未能遵奉勿作評論請求者、僅有天主敎之益世報一家、該報對於所傳之衝突事件、嚴厲譴責、軍事委員會所發之官方情報、除共黨之新華日報外、各報皆將之刊載、官方情報謂六月二十五日、由張艾平（譯音）所率領之第十八集團軍至某縣政府殺戮科長一人、擄去縣警衛隊七十餘人，並奪去步槍二百三十四桿、機關槍四挺、翌日駐於魯省保縣（譯音）東湖莊（譯音）之第十八集團軍部隊、又襲擊在魯省西南與日軍作戰之渝方游擊隊、死游擊隊員數十人、</p>
<p>周恩來氏籲請團結</p>
<p>共黨駐渝首席代表周恩來發表一文、表示懷疑是否確有此項衝突事件、並呼籲團結、該文開始即云、「余可闡明參加中條山戰事之命令、第十八集團軍曾一度在晋省東南之防區內擊日軍、但於完成任務後、即立刻退至其原來指定之地段、在魯省之樂陵桂平（譯音）及惠民等縣之防區、乃係中央政府所派與第十八集團軍者、其他華軍部隊如何可發生衝突、實際上果有任何衝突發生耶、軍事委員會於七月十八日接獲電報、在七月十九晶即將之發表、不獨朱德無答覆之時間、即余在事前亦未接通知、此即事實上之經過、吾人所要求者爲團結而非分裂、爲全力作戰而非內爭而已」、</p>

<p>路透社二十日華盛頓電　此間觀察家、咸認松岡之脫離日內閣，乃東京最重要之變更、惟繼任者爲政見如何向不著聞之人、故評論家欲估計日外相更迭之意義、頗感爲難、華盛頓郵報稱、松岡之去職、未必即日本對軸心國關係行將迅變之解、不過松岡使其國家受事實現已證明其爲矛盾的政策之束縛、自覺丢臉、故去職耳、現料日本仍將騎牆觀望、至見其進取政策、利多害少時而後止、惟此觀望時機未必甚久、因日本今日之唯一事業、厥爲作戰、其他考慮非所計也、紐約通報稱、日內閣之改組、他無所知、惟知近衛得海陸軍之同意、發動閣潮、以排除松崗耳、松岡必曾向希特勒進攻西伯利亞之允諾、希特勒亦未必現欲日本夾攻蘇聯、而日本陸軍領袖、以其有限之兵力與物力、更未必願與遠東蘇軍交綏、惟有可信者、松岡殆已允諾希特勒、日本必在太平洋作極大之擾亂、今日本旣不準備爲之、而欲取銷前言、則唯有使松岡去職耳、日本新內閣並非爲和平內閣、其組成份子多爲海陸軍人、可見其志在開拓、惟其所擬之開拓、不足予德國以多大之安慰、以海軍中人長外交、尤爲日本南進之表微、蓋南進乃海軍野心之所在、亦爲近衛新內閣所負之任務也、惟日本海軍之動作、完全不唯希特勒之馬首是瞻、而唯無害時方從事開拓是務、今無論日本在越南暹羅將有何種行動、以作將來對美作戰的更劇烈行動之準備、日本之外交政策、暫時將仍無使人感覺興趣之處、一若其新外相之不使人感覺興趣者然云、</p>
<p>英認日即將進攻泰與越</p>
<p>倫敦十九日電　倫敦華府兩地、正密切注意東京局勢之發展、蓋新閣之措施、足以影響太平洋之局勢也、此間觀察、倘無其他重大之意外變化、則日本之進攻越南泰國、僅屬時間問題、不出數日、即可見諸事實、目下德國雖促日本夾擊蘇聯、但日本似決心採取獨立機會主義之政策、受實惠者必需僅以日本一國爲限、日本需要油米錫樹膠甚切、南太平洋方面此種物資極多、但西伯利亞則吿缺乏、日本對華戰事、已吿棘手、自不願發動大規模戰事以免再度陷入不可收拾之局面、日本對蘇會有張鼓峰之經騐、蘇聯英勇對抗德軍閃電戰、亦巳四週、日本當亦知進攻西伯利亞危險性大、反之日本倘若實行南進、而不致與英美發生衝突、則遭遇之抵抗力必柔弱、甚至可以不致遭遇抵抗、日本深知英美必反對日本佔領泰國及越南之海空軍根據地、以致危及新加坡、影響南洋之戰略形勢、但日本同時亦深信英美不致僅僅爲此對日採取積極措置、日本預料英美或將聯合、實行經濟措置、以對付日本、（此事聞在英美當局討論中、）但日本顯然已準備對抗英美之聯合經濟辦法、日本最近曾故意散佈中英軍盟之說、以測騐英美對於日本佔領越南泰國時之反響、此間預料日本佔領越泰以後、當靜待機會、方始實行第二步策動、此事大半須視德蘇戰爭之結果如何而定、</p>
<p>荷印極注意日內閣改組</p>
<p>合衆社二十日巴達維亞電　荷蘭人士昨今兩日對日內閣之改組、均無甚評論、　其中某領袖則謂、日內閣此番改組、蓋以表明日本之政策、將成爲純粹的日木性質、且此項變遷、恐更爲惡劣、該官吏又稱、此次日內閣之更迭、更可知納粹在日本顯已失勢、但無論如何、吾人應嚴持獨立政策、縱令日內閣中軍人益增、吾人並不以爲意、一般回憶、荷蘭最近因恐出口貨、轉運德國、曾拒絕日本之要求、今荷蘭某官吏、此項言論、其意義必係不講日本之新政策如何、荷人仍將保衛其獨立談判之權利、而不受武力壓迫、此間荷人並謂英遠東軍司令樸芳上將所稱、「吾人業已準備」一語、可以代表荷印之態度云、</p>

<p>哈瓦斯社十九日維希電　消息靈通人士稱、達蘭中將接見佐藤事、並無重大意義、大抵佐藤大使係將日本內閣改組經過情形、吿知達蘭協理、查日本新任外相豐田大將、乃海軍將領、因此一般觀察家、對於遠東局勢之發展、極爲注意、又因越南地位迄今未變、及法國在亞洲尙擁有廣大利益之故、一般人對此遂益加關切、但各觀察家認爲日本今後之行動、仍當以對華爲主云、</p>

<h3>遠東局勢縱極嚴重　上海地位不變更　國際性之特質必須存在　華人法益尤應尊重保護</h3>
<p>日本內閣改組後、表面上雖較和緩、但由素與軍部熱絡之近衛繼任首相一點視之、可知日本遲早將採取另一軍事行動、而以南進尤屬可能、因此遠東局勢、又已達一新轉變階段、上海之地位、因日本南進後、太平洋戰事鞏將爆發、本埠數百萬中國人民、更與之有切身利害關係、茲將本埠某外籍評論家對此一問題所發表之意見、分誌於後、</p>
<p>上海現狀、必須維持</p>
<p>不論國際局勢如何瞬息萬變、上海之現狀、必須始終維持、即美日亂爭全面爆發、上海之國際性、仍須確保、在戰前或有人主張廢除上海之國際性、但如今日仍有人高唱此調者、無異墜入奸人毒計、而使百年來上海之合法地位、隳於一旦、此種潛藏之可能性、如無一敵對之決心、以防止其發生、則前途隱患無窮、特別在整個大局傾向於轉變之時、吾人尤須慎防維護上海傳統之現况於不墜、</p>
<p>華人利益應予尊重</p>
<p>所謂維持上海之國際性、就今日之情形言之、其涵義有（一）各國在滬之均勢、仍須繼續、（二）各國在滬工商貿易發展機會均等、（三）各國僑民在滬所享受之權利、即因環境係不能平等、亦不得有所憑藉、利己損人、（四）租界行政權、宜維持其一貫之獨立性、各事秉公處理、無所偏袒、（五）竭力戢止任何背景之恐怖案、以免造成有利於任何一方之藉口、（六）華人正當之利益、須一如戰前、予以尊重保護、總結以上六點、在目前上海須盡力使之中立、在容任何一國或任何一方面之勢力有特殊畸形之發展、</p>
<p>妥協綏靖　絕非所宜</p>
<p>與滬有關國家之本身、因可因局勢之突變、戰事之猝發、而失去其中立性、但在對滬關係上、仍須繼續其一貫維持均勢之政策、不可甘願妥協綏靖、以為其他國家或勢力、得有獨當一面之機會、換方之、上海之現况不可因国际局势之改变而改变、而须站在超然之地位、继续美满之发展与进步、否则上海情形、势将日趋恶劣、以致不可收拾、无论中西人士、其合法权益与地位、尽将滅绝、</p>
<p>英美立塲　力求堅定</p>
<p>質言之、上海均勢之兩方、一為英美及其他與英美採同一立塲之國家、一為日本及其附屬勢力暨其友邦德義等國、今日之均勢、維持至何種程度、眾所周知、但以後之均勢、端賴英美之態度而定、換言之、如須維護上海均勢、英美等國須不因國際局勢之轉變、而在滬作任何綏靖妥協之舉動、否則綏靖變為屈服、妥協反成放縱、不但其本身權益將盡為淘汰、而整個滬局將岌岌可危、無以為救、</p>
<p>市民必須　警覺憬悟</p>
<p>上海身民本市之警覺與憬悟、亦有利於上海局勢之維持、換言之、上海市民對於任何可能發生足以改變滬局之事態、應具决心戢止之、而於任何勢力之特殊膨脹、應以堅強之民意、予以對鎖、蓋民眾之精神力量、非武力恫嚇殘殺所能摧毀、因此為保障上海前途之安全、一方面須實際由英美主動絕滅妥協綏靖之根苗、另一方面須由民眾之精神偉力推動而支持之、</p>
<h3>美紅會垂念難胞　賬麥今日抵滬　即在本市及淪陷區發放</h3>
<p>美國紅十字會以據此間經會報告、需要醫藥物品與賑災美麥甚亟、除將價值美金一百萬元之藥物供運趕速運來外、其將於今日抵滬之亞萊伐號載重六千七百五十一噸、啣紅會命、載有碎麥共二百萬磅、奶粉五萬磅、該輪係由西雅圖於六月十五日來遠東、本可於十九日抵此、以航途遭遇惡劣氣候、致將航程展緩、繼之由西雅圖奉命載碎麥二萬磅來滬之加普洛號（載重三千一百二十七噸）、亦可於本月二十五日來滬、是項救濟物品、將分別在上海及淪陷區發放、又悉該會長相思德氏自乘批亞士總統　去美後、此間遺缺、暫由嘉達代攝、新任會長安徒生氏、即可於下月底買棹來滬履新、</p>
<h3>泰越兩地豐地　洋米成本減低　港米待機恢復原價</h3>
<p>據航業界息、昨日泰國錫生能輪、與法輪大達南相　進口、分別裝到暹米與西貢米、共計八萬餘包、其數量之鉅、為最近所罕有、本市存米、益見增加、業已超過一百二十萬包、聞泰越兩地洋米、今歲產量至豐、市價低落、米進口商因成本合算、邇來新訂購者甚眾、預計尚有數十萬包、月底運到、米價勢將暴跌、工部局港為限價、屆時亦須恢復每石三百十元原價、</p>
<p>到貨蠭湧　市價不定</p>
<p>本市整個民食、自經兩租界當局採諸標本兼施辦法、積極設法穩定以還、各項措置刻已顯收成效、非特來源蠭湧、存底激增、且大戶囤貨已乏人間津、各色米價呈現動　不定局面、故本市民食隱患、已告完全解除、投機米　、不無遭受嚴重打擊、惟兩當局決一秉初衷、繼續採諸有效辦法、穩定整個民食、以冀米價輾轉下游、减輕平民負担、確保社會治安、新　社記者昨向江海關探悉、</p>

<h3>反侵略戰爭　已入光明之途　英蘇成立同盟人心大振　軸心國敗績已拭目可待　俄文日報柴霍甫之評論</h3>
<p>本埠俄文日報、昨載一文、清算數周來之國際局勢、作者名柴霍甫、關係研究國際問題專家、所述各問題、均極扼要、蓋其觀感所及、頗足反映蘇聯對時局之態度、茲就原文迻譯於後、</p>
<p>對德清算　時期已屆</p>
<p>最近數周來、國際情勢之演變、其犖犖大者、當如下述、（一）英蘇簽訂軍事協定、規定雙方決不單獨對德媾和、決駢肩作戰、至納粹主義殲滅為止、是故該約之成立、必將使輾側呻吟希特勒束縛下睹民族、人心士氣、為之一振、此無異昭示彼等、與希特勒清算之日屆矣、（二）果敢之紅軍、已數度予德軍以打擊、德人所喪失之坦克車·飛機·軍火·不勝枚舉、軍士傷亡之數、亦以百萬計、希特勒此後當無法再以閃電戰術再作自欺欺人之談、證之紅軍在若干處反攻得手、德軍實已臨崩潰之前夜、展望前途、屠夫將不寒而慄、蘇聯國境、殆將作為希特勒黨之墳墓、</p>
<p>今後日本　似將南進</p>
<p>（三）近衛辭職與重行組閣、對日本未來政策、雖未宣佈、然就各處徴象言、日本似有南進意、虎視鷹瞵、擇肥而噬、越南及泰國、殆已成其獵弋之對象、（四）美國佔據冰島、並建築海空軍根據地、嗣後希特勒在大四洋欲擴展勢力、唯有望洋興嘆、（五）英人進佔叙利亞、與維希政府駐叙大員簽訂和約之舉、使軸心國今後在近東之發展、在目前已屬不可能、</p>
<p>華軍最近　即將反攻</p>
<p>（六）中國得美國獲得大批飛機接濟後、已使中國空軍、實力倍增、中國將藉新空軍之協助、當於最短期內、實行反攻、（七）美國不斷在南海作包圍日本之舉動、並與英國一致行動、決心保衛荷印·新加坡·菲列濱之安全、</p>
<p>西线戰事　有利英國</p>
<p>（八）英機一再襲擊德國、致魯爾區及德國西部、損失甚鉅（九）大西洋戰局、於協約國轉趨有利英軍抵抗堅強、德方此後已無法　沉大批英船、（十）美國製造飛機·坦克車及戰具、生產激增、最近英軍已可於各线上、以其優勢之空軍、壓倒對方、（十一）德軍佔領地帶、反抗情緒、與日俱增、而反蘇戰爭更為其奴役下諸民族所唾棄、綜合上述、全世界業已覺醒、現正進行反法西斯自由解放之偉業、此種鬥爭條件、已使協助約國之情勢、益趨光明、軸疏國於短期內、將有重要政治及軍事之敗績、吾人當可拭目以待、</p>
<h3>美名記者史蒂爾　將赴莫斯科</h3>
<p>芝加哥日報駐遠東記者史蒂爾（Steel）、將於最近前往莫斯科、史氏前任紐約時報駐北平記者、在中日戰爭期中、爪哇·泰國·緬甸·印度、時有其游踪、最近甫自滇緬公路旅行返滬、聞期遺缺、將由史杜英接替、彼刻正首途來滬、按史氏亦係一名記者、歐戰前數年、曾任紐約講壇報駐巴黎主任、並獲得普里資獎金、後任支加哥日報記者、曾目擊德軍進侵挪威、遂自該處及芬蘭拍發動人之新聞電、嗣後復充任無线電台之政治報告員、</p>
<h3>佛教之来源</h3>
<p>融五讲经社第十九次计经，杨中一君讲佛教之来源。佛教开祖釋迦牟尼，華言能仁，姓喬答摩，多悉達多。父迦維衛城主輸頭陀那，母拘利城主女摩耶。以周靈王十五年四月八日即西元前五八年，生於嵐昆尼園無憂樹下，東洋史要及辭源大事表同。史要父云，卒於景王二年，即西前五四三年，與錫蘭及西藏傳說差近，可信。亦有云生景王五年，襄王二十七年者，謝承後漢紀，魏收釋老志，費長房開皇三實錄，始以生莊王十年，即魯莊公七年，春秋恒星不見為瑞應。六朝時，盛傳老子化胡說，互爭先後，愈推愈前，遂生桓王，平王之世。唐貞觀二年詔法詳琳　，更上生西周昭王時，且有生商王武乙及夏桀時說，生年上下，差至千載之遠，奇矣！說詳楊踐形釋迦生年考。</p>
<p>復次，佛教傳入中國說可徴者，袁宏後漢紀，范曄後漢書西域傳，傳曰：“世傳明帝夢見金人，問羣臣，或曰，西方有神名佛，於是遣使天竺問佛道法，遂於中國圖書形像，楚王英始信具術。”二書皆無確年，宋志盤佛祖統紀始定為永平十年。而佛祖歷代統載則去七年，廣弘明集更說三年，其所遣使，出三藏記集四十二，章經序云：張騫等十二人，歷代三實紀云秦景等十四人，統紀云蔡愔等十八人所至地，或云天竺，或云月氏，携來者，或云佛像，或云佛經。王琰冥祥記始云摩騰東來，高僧傳更加法　，為二僧同至洛陽。魏收釋老志又云：“哀帝元　元年，月氏王使伊存口授秦景憲浮屠經。”魏略西戎傳作景盧，宋宗炳明佛論，世說文學篇注引劉向列仙傳“七十四人在佛經”，則在成帝時矣。顏氏家訓書證篇謂“贊云七十四人出佛經，由後人所　，非本文也。”釋老志又云“張騫使大夏，始聞浮屠之教。”且云，“漢武元狩中，獲休屠王金人，燒香禮拜。”王儉漢武故事同，宗炳更云，“東方朔，言及劫火，已知佛法，”則在武帝時矣。然范曄西域傳，論曰“佛道神化，興自身毒，而二漢方志，莫有稱焉。”再前則葉始皇時有外國沙門　利防等持佛經來化，見釋道安朱士行經目錄。又前戰國時燕昭王七年，道人尸羅荷錫持餅，能於指端出浮屠十層，見王嘉拾遺記。更前則春秋時，廣弘明集引列子“孔子聞西方有對者？”然宗炳答何承天書，“周孔於佛所未嘗言，”牟子理惑論，“堯舜周孔不知佛道，”何也？續高僧傳引周書異記“昭王大史蘇由，穆王大史扈多”語，則在西周，明佛論“伯益述出海，天毒之國，郭璞注浮屠所興，亦如來大慈之訓，”則大禹之世，已有佛法矣。計其時在釋迦降生前一千六百二十餘年。</p>

<h3>經廣州灣赴內地　途徑與旅費</h3>
<p>— 漱南</p>
<p>現在要到內地去，祇有兩條路走是最妥當：一條是經廣州灣而到廣西，另一條是經仰光而轉入滇緬公路。若經仰光走，則比較麻煩；非但護照數月不見簽出，並且到了那邊，行李檢查得很苛嚴，所以不是經廣州灣走比較好些。</p>
<p>這裏是幾位到達內地的朋友，所做的一份報吿，不但旅費路徑日程都說得很詳細，而且把途中應注意的地方，也說得非常淸楚，旅費當然都以最經濟計算。我想讀者中要至內地去的很多吧，那你可以氫牠來參考一下。</p>
<p>（一）上海至香港：乘太古或怡和輪船約三日夜可抵港，最次船票國幣五十元，小賬十元（伙食船上供給）。到港上岸行李交中國旅行社，提送至旅館，每件港幣一元一角（如是可免檢查麻煩），行李以二件計，假定留港五天候船，可住大東旅館（在德輔道永安司旁），每日最低食宿港幣四元。</p>
<p>（二）香港至廣州灣：有大寳石輪行駛其間，行李二件交中旅社送上船，每件取費港幣一元一角。船票向中旅社購，約港幣十八元—三等。一日夜可達，船上供食宿。</p>
<p>（三）廣州灣至赤坎：汽車約半小時、須多人合雇一車，每人連行李約國幣二十元。（以下均用國幣）。</p>
<p>（四）赤坎至　林：坐抬轎六天可達，每人抬費二百五十元（一人坐一轎，行李不能隨身帶，雖小包亦為轎夫所不允），行李每市斤八角，假定以一百四十市斤計，共須一一二元，六天食宿共六〇元。最要注意者，即能多人合一團體，行李轎在前，客轎在後，以便督視，每到一宿站亦須輪流注意，尤以石角宿站要特別注意，以該處警力稍差，挑夫每拆竊行李。第一日赤坎至逐溪，第二日逐溪至廉江，第三日廉江至石角，第四日石角至良田，第五日良田至陸川，第六日陸川至　林。</p>
<p>（五）　林至貴縣：以多人合雇汽車，最簡捷合算，一日可達，每人連行李約八〇元。如無汽車，可乘三輪脚踏車，二日可到每輛三〇元，惟中途有高坡，須下車行走一或二公里。如坐轎須三天約需百元。</p>
<p>（六）貴縣至桂平：乘小火輪拖船，船票三元二角加小賬五角。此時須有身份證明書，否則購票及沿途檢查麻煩，且留難甚多。</p>
<p>（七）桂平至石龍：乘小火輪拖船二日可到達，船票四元半，加小賬半元。船中甚苦，西江水急多礁，為免搬運行李，故大都船中過夜，駁船無艙。貴縣至石龍之伙食費約十八元。</p>
<p>（八）石龍至柳州：乘公路局汽車，車票價二十元，惟客票不易購到，往往候四五日之多，行李二十公斤以下免費，超過重量，每十公斤取費八元。假定石龍候車五日，則食宿費約四十元。</p>
<p>（九）柳州至宜山：乘黔桂綫火車，二等票價六元，四小時可到，當日宿宜山約費用六元。</p>
<p>（十）宜山至貴陽：乘公路汽車一百四十元左右，需三天可達，行李超過二十公斤，須付運費約四十元，如有裝貨便車較為便宜，食宿三天三十元。</p>
<p>（十一）貴陽至昆明：公路汽車一百廿七元五角。行李超出費約六十元，惟公路局車不能同時將行李運昆，故設法搭便車最好，行程三天。如赴重慶者，可由貴陽搭乘公路汽車赴渝，行程二日半，票價一百十七元一角二分。</p>
<p>附註：（一）全程最快須三十五天，多至一個半月。（二）行李以二件最便，重約一百四十斤計。（三）全程旅費共合國幣一三八五元零七角，係最經濟辦法計算，如在途中多耽擱一天，則多費十元，故全程旅費須帶，港幣五十五元，及國幣一二五〇元。（四）身份證明書係備中途檢查用，須銀行出具，最好有內地機關出證明，可較方便。（五）廣西通用貨幣叫桂子，桂子一元合法幣五角。（六）數人同行最好，非但可相互照顧，而且有時旅費亦可合算，故一人不可貿然起行。</p>

<h3>中國戰時財政經濟政策之改進（續完）</h3>
<p>— 夏炎德</p>
<p>糧食政策</p>
<p>在戰時經濟政策中，足食足兵同樣重要；糧食的充足在支持戰局與安定民生係實史爲重大。上次歐戰時，英德兩國交戰中。注意用潛艇政策封鎖對方糧食供給，截斷敵國軍民的牛命腺，後來德國失敗就是爲了糧食不繼，以至軍心渙散民心動搖。這次英德再戰，德國攻英仍注意在海上攔斷糧食及其他物資的運輸。戰事發生後，歐洲糧食問題極端嚴重，交戰各國除了竭力設法保持供給，對內早已實行統制；如德國的計口授糧，英國的限制消費，其他各國也各採有效的辦法。</p>
<p>中國糧食在平時大體可以自給，戰後三年各省連年豐收，糧食不生問題，仍維持市塲自由買賣的法則，未加嚴格統制。政府雖在二十六年八月頒布「戰時糧食管理條例」，作初步的統制，但並無顯著的功效。以至戰事進入第四年，各地米價扶搖直上，百物隨之昂貴，平民生計陷於恐慌，形成一個嚴肅的社會問題。</p>
<p>這種米價飛漲的原因，不在乎法幣發行的突然增加，也不在乎供應的缺乏。據中央農業實騐所報吿：去年米糧的生產與前年不相上下，有的省份雖略减少，有的省份則有增加，總數無大出入。即使略感不敷，過去存糧足够應付有餘。近來米糧上漲，並非自然缺少的結果，而爲人爲高抬所造成。少數達官富商居奇囤積，地主富農待高價出售，存貨一時不能化爲供給，中上之家憂慮米價之繼漲與米糧之不繼，爭先買進堆存，市塲需求超過消費需要，供求背道而馳，卒至造成今日米價的高峯。此種無理暴漲，旣爲人力所造成，便當用政治力量加以抑止。</p>
<p>一年以來政府鑒於此種情勢，糧食政策屢有更張。原則上決定實行管理，以維持民食充實軍糧。在行政院中，專設一全國糧食管理局，現擴大範圍改爲糧食部，其下省設糧食管理局，縣市設糧食管理委員會，負責各級管理事宜。對於囤積居奇嚴厲取締，發覺官吏有囤積行爲者判處死刑，以收懲一儆百之效。糧食價格決由各省詊價委員會公定。對米糧進口予以鼓勵，出口則予禁止。現在田賦改征實物，也可聚積粉食，平抑米價，此外還發行糧食庫券購進糧食，公營買賣也在初步實施中。有些省份且施行特殊辦法：如湖南的獻糧，福建的公賣，四川重慶的存糧登記，及浙江金華的計口授糧等等。</p>
<p>有的政府要員主張政府非但要管理糧食，而且進一步要實行糧食國營，將全國所有糧食，除耕者必需的一部分外，其餘概由國家公買公賣。這種建議自然是徹底而且革命的政策，可以立即解決分配不均的問題；但最大的流弊容易使產量减少，過去蘇聯因而發生飢饉，餓死了幾自萬人。所以吾以爲還是採穩健的辦法：一面獎勵糧食生產，一面禁止糧食浪費，並用平價購銷或限價的方式，使糧食生產不致减少而得到公允的價格與合理的分配。</p>
<p>土地政策</p>
<p>財政會議宣言表示糧食政策與土地政策是民生主義的兩大政策，應當同時並行。目前所施行的糧食政策，只是治標辦法，根本解決須實行土地政策，察其用意，認爲糧食只是土地的生產物，平抑土地生產物價格不過减少土地的所得，如果進一步改革土地制度，則土地本身已得公平分配，這種所得便根本無從產生。中山先生提倡平均地權是要平均社會財富分配，消除不勞利得；其實施辦法可分數點：（一）照價抽稅，（二）照價收買，（三）漲價歸公，（四）耕者有其田，於最後一點尤爲注重。以後國府制定的土地法，在實施各方面有比較詳細的規定。現在當局聲明要推行平均地權的政策，但沒有提出何種新的辦法，大概是預備遵照民生主義及土地法的現定方針實行吧。</p>
<p>有的政府要員說平均地權就是土地國有的政策，應把土地漸歸國有，國家變成大地主；並主張仿蘇聯的榜樣，用革命方式達成此目的。吾却不以爲然，中山先生的政策並不想把土地收歸國有，除了公共需用的土地可以收買的公有外，大部分仍歸人民所有。他的辦法可說是一種土地農有的政策，雖以土地公有爲最後理想，但目前實施只要使土地民衆化，即實行耕者有其田。國家旣不想做大地主，無償沒收的辦法也就不必採用。</p>
<p>最近中國農民銀行奉財政部令，設立土地金融處，以資本五千萬元，舉辦長期農業信用貸款，並准許發行土地債券，據知貸款分下列幾種：（一）土地照價收買放款，（二）土地微用放款，（三）土地改良放款，（四）土地重劃放款，（五）扶助自耕農放款，（六）地藉整理放款　其中第四，六項在幫助政府整理土地，第一，二項在幫助政府購買土地，第五，三項在幫助農民購買並利、用土地。其全要用意當在以發行的土地債券貸與貧農與佃戶　，向地主購買耕地，以達到耕者有其田目的。不過此項工作非常艱鉅，決不是農民銀行區區資力所能勝任，且若地主不肯售田政府又如何對付。這是內政上極大的改革，在外患極端嚴重的今日，吾怕還不是適當實行的時期。</p>
<p>結語</p>
<p>綜觀五屆八中全會與三次財政會議的決議：財政政策在使全國收支平衡與國民負擔平均；糧食政策在抑止囤積投機而維持軍糧民食；土地政策在實現平均地權而使耕者有其田。其中土地政策只表示一點意向，糧食政策也是原則居多，對於財政政策則提出了幾個比較具體的辦法，除在消極方面革除多年弊政，還從積極方面建設健全財政；比了第一次財政會議所定的裁撤釐金與關稅自主，與第二次財政會議所定的改革田賦與廢除苛雜，範圍旣較廣泛，意義也來得重大。尤其平均國民負擔一點，爲我們所樂聞。</p>
<p>過去政府所辦的戰時財政，在籌措戰費上總算盡了很大的能力；幾年來供應不竭，沒有妨礙作戰的進行。但戰費以負担却不很公平，此點即最高軍事當軸也坦白承認。政府在戰事開始二年多中，增發通貨的數雖不多，可是因沒有想出有效的辦法將它吸收到生產建設上，以致引起物價高漲，物價高漲，一面增加通貨的需要與供給，一面使游資在市面上得有投機獲利的機會。物價愈高，法幣增發愈多，投機利潤愈厚，物價也因而不斷上昇。如此反覆循環，使富者成爲暴富，貧者流爲赤貧，中人也陷於貧困。一在今日勞務所得實在太薄；試觀多少公務員，智識階級與平民，於戰時國家貢獻極大，而生活極度艱苦。另一方面，財產所得太厚，少數有產的投機份子獲得平時所夢想不到的利益，在歐西交戰國家，決計看不到這種現象。如德國一開戰即微發民間資本十分之四，營業利潤最高不得超過五釐，根本沒有得到暴利的可能。英國戰後也徵發國民持有外匯，戰時利得稅率最高提到百分之百。政府現在重新注重運用租稅政策籌措戰費，對於上述現象必須糾正，使戰費以支出眞由能力大者負担。</p>
<p>今日中國處在一個緊要關頭，除了全力搶救國家的生存，同時要顧到以後建設的百年大計。戰爭能使一國經濟改觀：它可以引導國家到資本主義的路上，也可以漸漸引導到民生主義或社會主義路上。吾們現在以一切財政經濟政策，不但要適應戰時龐大的需要，還要符合國民經濟與社會正義的原則。政府應用運用權力，一面使有錢者出錢，一面維持平民必要的生活。在長期戰爭中，民族與民生必須兼籌並顧。這次會議的重要辦法與這些原則大致相差不遠。至實際成效，還得看以後推行如何。現在民閒自當遵守「有錢者出錢，有力者出力」的原則，官方也得抱定「文官不要錢，武官不怕死」的精神，國家前途纔有有希望。</p>
<h3>國防的農工建設論</h3>
<p>— 陳禾章</p>
<p>一，國防建設的重要性</p>
<p>經騐告訴我們：戰爭是人類絕不可磨滅的本性。試看歷史上記載出來的戰爭，不知有多少次，若把這許多戰爭分析一下，又可說明戰爭是民族生存不可缺少的要件。「優勝劣欺，弱肉强食」是物競天演的原則。所謂「適者生存」，這句話，不但適用於自然界，也適用於人羣；不但適用於個人，並且也適用於民族。（註一）民族競爭的優劣，完全擊於國　力的强弱。這國防不僅指武備的力量，更指思想的力量，而特別是指經濟的偉力，簡言之，便是國防經濟力。</p>
<p>軍與以後，中國國民黨曾制定「抗建網領」，其中經濟綱領的第一條：「經濟建設，以軍事為中心，同時注意改善人民生活。」其間「以軍事為中心」，實質上即「以國防為中心」所謂國防的經濟建設，其鵠的並不在單翼的擴張武備，要知國防的他翼，是一不可忽視的經濟力。戰爭的方式多端，而其中最厲害，同時又最毒辣的一種，要算經濟戰爭。（註二）中國爲了完成此番抗建的使命，早已決定建立一個自給自足，自力更生的國防經濟。</p>
<p>國防經濟力究以何者養成？考之新興國家，無不以培養重工業和工需工業爲急務。遠之如俄國的彼得大帝，近之如蘇聯的五年計劃，德國的四年計刻，均以國防觀點爲中心，來養成國防的經濟力。中國何如？重工乎？重農乎？抑或農工並重，這就是本文所要討淪的主題。</p>
<p>二，農工建設的特徵及其偉績</p>
<p>中國究應爲農業國抑或工業國，實是抗建過程中必需解決的問題。根據中國的基本需要，證諸他國以往的經騐，多數專家認爲國尺經濟建設，惟有以工業化來促成之。然則中國百分之七十五以上人口業農，農業所得的得佔全國國民所得百分之八十，而農產品出口又佔總出口値百分之七十左右，農業在中國經濟上地位的重要，可以想見。這樣看來，豈可以捨農業而代以工業，因此中國所需要的，是以工業推動農業，藉農業以樹立工業，猶之美國和蘇聯，在極高度工業化進展之中，農業生產並不偏廢。換言之，中國需要「重工」而不「廢農」；但又非主張工業與農業的平均發展，惟力求其乎衡發展。所謂平衡發展，即期於工業發展程序中，顧及農業資源開發與利用，而農業改進及推廣的目標，仍顧及如何促進工業的生產。概括地說，就是農業工業化。至於中國爲何需要農業工業化？非本文篇幅所容許。不過大體上，農業工業化，就農村經濟的立塲論，係爲發展農村固有的各種手工業，由工具，技術及組織方式的改良，以增加農業經營的收益。其生產方式或爲自產原料的加工，或爲購入原料或半製品的加工。就工業經濟立塲論，農業工業化又是新式工業向農業分散的惟一途徑，以工業資本移就農村過剩的勞力與低廉的工價與原料，藉圖生產成本的减低。（註三）所以可說中一國是需要農工並重。</p>
<p>事業上，中國作戰以後，國防的經濟建設，即抱定農工並重的力針。關於此點，經濟部長翁文灝先生在他所作「經濟建設方針」一文中，曾明白地說：『今日我國經濟建設的目的有二：（一）爲國防而建設；（二）爲民生而建設。故擬抱定二大方針：一日工鑛並舉，二日農工並重。語其具體目標約可條舉四端：（一）樹立國防基礎工業，促進鑛業之開發，電力之供給，並爲普通工業樹立基礎；（二）促進農業改良及科學方法利用，以期增加產量，並改善農民生計；（三）利用本國原料，改善工農鑛生產技術，以期减輕成本，推廣銷塲，使食糧燃料以及其他必需用品漸能自給；（四）健全農村經濟及工商業團體之組織，使能互相協助，運用靈活。』從這一段看來，不難概見中國國防經濟建設的政策，實已注意到農工各方面。這裏要說明，本文所指農工，是廣義的農工，前者包括林業，後者包括鑛業。由此可推知，中國的國防經濟力，實包含農，林，工，鈹各方面。所以，中國國防經濟力的養成，在於農工的根據實際需要，作合理的建設。所謂建設的合理化，即指農工應平衡發展，不能過於偏重；所有建股，應合乎國防上的要求，因爲無國防的建設，與不建設無異。</p>
<p>作戰以來，四年於茲，若檢討一下農工建設，我們好設都循着合理化途徑進行，而其偉績，實有足述者。進步的情形，可根據經濟部部長翁文灝先生所說：『戰前我國國防重工業爲數甚少，雖政府　盡力劃籌備，但多尙未能開工生產。今日我國國防重工業，鋼鐵，機械，電器，化學以及採鑛各部門，國營民營兼程並進，皆已產品。雖距自給自足尙有相當距離；但已建樹起國防工業自力更生的廣大基礎。戰前我國農村凋敝已極，而以西南西北各省爲尤甚。今日我西南西北各省，因農業金融之融通，農田水利之興辦，農業合作之推行，農業技術之改良，經濟作物之出口，確尸大有進步。』</p>
<p>農業工業化的目的，在於促成全國人民的足食足衣，兼而促進農作物的大量輸出。中國糧食本足自給，作戰以還，連年豐收，糧食供需，當無困難；但因交通阻礙，運愉不便，民間囤積，逐漸增多，刺激糧價上漲，是無可否認的。當局對此，正採有效的統制，這局部的現象，當不難解決。至於足衣一事，以全國而論，棉衣的供給已不成問題。全國棉花的產量在二十六年已達一千二百餘萬擔，以前棉花是入超的，到了二十六年已經變爲出超，可惜戰區面積擴大，不免受到重大影響。於是政府一方面在四川雲南等省增加優良棉花的種植，另面努力把鄂西及陝西等省過剩的棉花運到西南。紡織工廠內遷的截至二十八年底止，已十二家，據報載本年六月底，新添的工廠及紡織廠可達四百家，所以足供給大量軍隊和後方多數人民的需要。他如農作物中的桐油，茶葉，猪鬃等，在政府統銷和獎勵之下，出口數量甚爲可觀，對加增外滙的來源，更有偉大的貢獻。</p>
<p>至於工業本身，自由中國工業投資總數達十五萬萬元，各工廠生產總值，二十九年為三十四萬萬元，較之二十八年的十四萬萬元，猛增一倍半；而輕重工業在西南西北亦已形成十一個中心，新式工廠總數達一千四百家，連戰前幾無出產的汽油酒精，現亦能月產四五十萬介侖。諸如此類的成績，雖罄萬言，尙不能道其萬一。</p>
<p>三，農工建設的展望</p>
<p>綜上以觀，新式工業的經營，正在滋長，農業的革新工作，已露曙光，這實已樹立起國防建設的廣大基礎。今後爲求百尺竿頭更進一步，完成建國的偉業起見，尙須努力於農業工業的平衡發展，而更須採行完美的經濟制度。</p>
<p>中國的經濟制度，無疑的，當然採取以民生主議爲建設中心的經濟制虔。關於此點，衛挺生先生所作「西南經濟建設之十大政策」一文中，會有透澈的說明，茲特援引如下：「我國經濟建設事業，應以民生主義爲依歸，而達到民享之目的。民生主義兼採資本主義共產生義兩者之長，使社會以生產之利，普及爲全體人民所享受，其事業不爲特殊份子所操縱，其利益不爲資本階級所獨佔。一方面由國家用商業方式以直接經營生產事業，一方面由國家指導小規模之民營企業，構成社會生產之一環，即是一方面發達國家資本，一方面節制私人資本，在生產上，力求生產之增加，在分配上，力求分配之合理。民生主義之分配社會化，是在漸進方法中，同時解決生產與分配之問題。」（註四）事實上，中國政府的經濟建設計劃，即係遵照孫總理遺敎重工業及國防工業以國營爲原則，輕工業以政府獎勵民營爲原則。請觀國內的交通工具，早已收歸國有，規模較大的鑛區，尤其是國防工業和重工業的鑛區，亦已劃爲國營鑛區。至於私人事業方面，政府當局也竭力提倡，以期分工合作，配合並進。如政府對於私人企業的獎勵，官商合作等，均經制定法令和辦法。至於農業方面，最近第三次全國財政會議議決實行糧食政策及土地政策，其目的在解決軍糈民食，平均地權，以實現民生主義。從上看來，政府當局業已採行民生主義的經濟制度，向着合理化的大道邁進。我們瞻望前途，實覺無限的興奮與欣慰！</p>
<p>但是國防農工建設的順利完成，尙有待於我們的最大努力。前面說過，戰爭是人類絕不可磨滅的本性。因此，全民族的生存取得了「國防」，集體中的個人才有「享受」可言。所以在建國的今日，我們不得不先把「國防」放在第一，而把「享受」放在第二。</p>

<h3>蔗與蔗糖（四）</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>現在把甘蔗這寳貴的植物普及到世界各處的經過簡述一下。當公元一四二〇年時，那鼓勵探尋新航路的著名的葡萄牙王子亨利，已竟把甘蔗培植在新發現的加那利羣島和馬得拉羣島。——全在非洲西北大西洋中。——哥倫布在公元一四九四年作他第二次的新大陸探險時，也把甘蔗傳播在西印度羣島中的海地　；它由是而近水樓臺的先廣播到古巴，又於十六世紀初侵入巴西，一五二〇年左右進了墨西哥，更進一步的遂傳遍美洲各地。尤其是海地島的聖多明峨，甘蔗輸入不久到一五一五年，已能按步就班的大批生產蔗糖了。它此後保持着第一把交椅，有「糖島」的名稱：譬如在法　大革命初起時的那一七八九年，它有糖廠七百二十三家，年產糖量一萬萬公斤！然而兩年以後，它也發生了一次劇烈的革命，全島的糖工業因而破壞凈盡，遂不能不把首屈一指的地位轉讓給鄰島古巴了。現在古巴年產糖二百　十萬噸，論名額雖次於印度，然而賞在能左右全世界的蔗糖市塲哩，總之，甘蔗輸入到新大陸不及一百年的工夫，蔗糖的輸出已佔貨品中最重要的地位；而且品質好，價格廉，遠勝歐人所製之糖；於是銷路當然日益廣闊，遂如水銀瀉地無孔不入的普及到世界各區了。至於甘蔗的傳到南非洲納塔耳地方和澳洲的新威爾士地方，係在一八五二年；還有東印　島像爪哇蘇門答臘等島旣然和印度只是一水相隔，甘蔗是在什麼時候就已竟傳主了呢？這問題我們不能回答，如同不能回答印度人在什麽時候就開始栽種甘蔗一樣。——總結一句：新大陸發現後，有多少名貴有益的植物贈獻給舊大陸；現在有舊大陸的甘蔗——當然還有咖啡——作爲我們的『回敬」，也算盡了「禮尙往來」這份人情了。</p>

<p>衣食住行</p>
<h3>節省衣食住行的費用響應申報助學金運動！</h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>生活在這個動蕩的時代，衣食住行四項的費用，在我們的經濟上，總估着很重要的一頁，就是物價飛漲我們也不能不生活，爲了要生活，只得作衣食住行的奴隸。要是把孤島上每一個中等家庭每一日的支出，統計一下，着實驚人；以致做家長的爲着這衣食住行，終日奔波，以求一最低限度的生活。然而孤島上挺多有錢階級，百物的漲價，似乎與他們無關，依然穿綢着緞，山珍海味，新式洋房，摩登汽車，單在行的一項下，每月支出近千元，也毫不爲奇，但在貧苦的方面，連一塊大餅都小能解決的，在孤島上也觸目皆是，同是一個人，一在天堂，一在地獄，竞有天壤之別。因此因貧困人的衆多，產生了種種的慈善機關，靠社會人士來支持，但是這些慈善機關大都是關於物質上的救濟，而孤島上確有不少有志求學的靑年，苦無物質的援助，對着一切都需錢的學校發怔；况且他們物質的食糧尙感恐慌，而一陣求知慾的波浪，在他們心頭上衝搫，似乎比了物質食糧更感嚴重，就是他們有求知的決心，苦無金錢的救濟，以致失學失業而淪落，然而人是有同情心的，決不致視若無觀，何不加以援助呢？</p>
<p>靑年是國家的命脈，是未來的主人翁，我想每一個本刋讀者都早已熟知的，那何不加以一臂之助？就是在日常費用支出項下節省一些，也是輕而易舉的，試想在衣食住行四項上，那一項不可節省一些？就是微乎其微的一二分也好，例如在衣項下，如要剪一元一尺的布，不妨改剪九角左右一尺，價錢雖相差一二分，而布質的相差不致過大的，一樣的穿，而錢是省下來了。在食項下，如要買一元的小菜，就省一角錢，改買一元九角，一天能省一角，十天能省一元了，况且少吃一角錢的菜，不致在營養上發生什麽不足的弊病吧。在住項下，每天早一些睡覺，就能省一些　費，一月能省好幾元，一方面又能養成早睡早起的好習慣，反能促進身體的康健。在行項下，每天多走路，少乘車，就能節省車錢，總之，在日常費用上節省一二角，眞是件不費力的事，然而筆者不是提侣節省得連飯都不要吃，而是在可能範圍內，節省一些不必要的耗費，一面能養成節儉習慣，一面能珍惜物力；而更値得稱頌的，就是把衣食住行項下節省下來的錢，來捐助給苦學靑年，替國家培養有用的人才！也是爲民族保存了一些元氣；這種功績是多麼的偉大！所以請大家來提倡節省日常的費用，響應申報助學金運動！那非但是苦學靑年之幸！爲社會之幸！亦爲國家之幸！更爲民族之幸！願大家各各努力吧！</p>

<p>以竹類作為衣服原料，英國政府專賣局早已發出一種專賣執照，用途與麻棉相等，製法係先將竹浸於化學溶液中若干日，迨纖維旣盡分離，取出烘乾之，即可紡織成衣，成本甚廉，在熱帶區域竹之生長極茂，故不虞原料缺乏。</p>
<p>美國麻省女科學家德葉夫人曾發明一種製衣紙，英文名爲Sona，據云：此紙質料滑軟，有如柔革，入水不濡，入火不熱，可以洗濯，可以熨摺，並可染上各種顏色，歷久不變，此紙之特點，在於不但功用與布類相等，而且較布類更可運用靈活。</p>
<p>地中海之某部份，產一種貝類，其介殼約寬三寸，長約七寸，每一介殼之中，含有極精緻之絲一束，與其他海中植物混合，兼爲泥漿所淹汚，一經洗濯梳理之後，呈金黄燦爛之色。與眞正蠶絲無異，製絲者須有經騐，織成後可製絲櫗領帶，手套，領巾之類。</p>
<p>美國羅省爲女伶薈萃之區，服裝花樣，鬥勝爭新，不一而足，著名女伶，時遄赴巴黎採辦新衣，但自利用電綫照像原理後，將新式花樣由巴黎藉海電之傳達至羅省，織緞之機，已預備妥當，花樣一到，即開始照樣織造，二十四時後已可出現於市面上，從此婦女們不必遠渡重洋矣！（按此爲此次大戰前情形）。</p>
<p>各種織物之保護皮膚程度，據美國於羅斯省立農科大學派定科學家多人研究結果，動物性纖維較植物件纖維能多吸牧日光，着麻織物立於夏日下，一小時半後皮膚受灼而呈黑色，棉織物需二小時，毛織物需七小時，絲織物則需十小時，據此觀之，絲織物保護皮膚之功効，較其他各種均過之。</p>
<p>美洲中部有一觀花邊樹，其樹皮內層，文彩燦然，有條不紊，雖精巧織工，亦不是過，約三百年前，西班牙王誕日，其旅居墨西哥之臣民獻一花邊樹製成之衣領，除剪裁而磨光外，全係天生。</p>
<h3>太太魚在河南</h3>
<p>— 晆景春</p>
<p>讀前期本刋陳念雲君「太太魚」一稿，專閒確鑒，洵食品之趣談，惟其地名謬誤，用是補述，非敢求疵，藉以糾正。</p>
<p>按「太太魚」，俗稱「金銀鳳凰魚」，夙著汴垣，顧名思義，可知確非凡品，故爲當地名貴菜餚之一。良以鯉魚各處皆出，未有如開封之黄河鯉魚碩大無比，而鮮美可口也。其調味煮法，雖如前述，但將魚洗滌，魚腹內一切，均須除去，用油煎時，火力宜淡，煮沸後，酒醋應特加重，則味益美，食之有欲罷不可之慨。是以汴垣人士多用以款上客，設無此品，則認爲不敬，因此菜館中亦莫不居奇，售價尤昂。愚於民國二十三年任職該地時，嘗以三吊八百文購得一尾，煮而食之，殊覺與普通鯉魚味逈異；似與蛇味相彷彿，鮮美尤過之。至於「太太魚」之名稱，乃係前豫省主席劉峙夫人而發明是實，（按陳君文謂係湖南，諒係河南之誤也。）緣劉氏在汴有年，對夫人頗尊重。一日，劉宴嘉賓於省署，在座者有秘書長方其道，財政廳長齊眞如，建設廳長張若愚，暨各區行政督察專員等，濟濟一堂，備極懽愉。詎筵席中佳餚俱備，惟此「金銀鳳凰魚」獨付闕如，劉夫人遂亟命庖者重金購來，親自煮之以進客，於是「太太魚」之名，竞喧傳人口焉</p>
<h3>今日之住</h3>
<p>朱嬰</p>
<p>戰爭果然給予人類以殘酷的生活苦痛，這苦痛，却能刺激麻木已久的民族，重新提醒它所以生存的價値；由這價値，知道創造文明，那凱撒式的武功的光榮，實非必要幸福的上海人，居然一度得到了生活經騐，整個城市　為戰區，變成火獄，砲聲在吼，飛機在交戰，夜空裏飛馳着各色各樣的流星，照理應該打醒了；然而儘有好事的男女，睜着趣味的眼珠，照那裏起火，那裏傾圮了建築物，又驚懼，又愉快！</p>
<p>可惜我們的軍隊，硬幹了三個月走了，使幸災樂禍者的心理，起初是悲哀，繼着是恐怖，再繼着是徬徨，最後由假痴假聾，而變爲「若無其事」，一方面儘量享樂，一方面儘量投機！忘記了昨天的刺刀，飲食啤酒來祝賀明天好運道的來臨游資滿積在投機家的手中，再也不會自動向內地流去！唯其飽食思動，於是「囤積居奇」的作風，輪到了每一生活的部鬥：衣食住行，那一種不增了價格？又那一種不在與時間競爭，互相比例地繼漲增高的直綫向上？米煤飛漲，交通車輛一再加價，棉布毛織品，又提高了百分之百的行情，無怪住這問題，至今日益吿興風作浪。　　本來戰後人口，由多减少，許多住房，全被街壓封住了。及淪陷區愈廣，來此避難者愈衆，乃有屋少人多之感。所謂避難者，又都爲各地大富或小有財的階層，所以稍出貴價，購置地產，頗不謂奇。鑒於銀行地產押款之造屋分租，自二十八年迄今，猶未衰落的情况看來，可以確信無疑。另一方面，地產把持有人，妬忌衣食行的大好買賣，也想乘機榨取，故對於貧苦的租賃人，先之以加租，繼之以下令搬塲，到了現在，又有新的組織—負責趕走房客的集團發現了！就爲了行政當局的不聞不問，間接助長了惡徒鼓動的凶燄，竟使一幢三層樓舊屋，月租要一百多塊，頂費是八千五百；一個寫字間，大小只一方丈零，連電話一座出頂，說要六七千塊天喲！誰實爲之？誰實爲之！</p>
<p>我友火雪明先生，向在明德女中講學，最近他要覓一間牛屋，奔了幾天，毫無成就。即使想看方法，誰都不能給他一點幫助。因此我發一奇想：上海有許多大公館，他們的少爺小姐，往往為了安全，不進學校，聘師教授，而他們的房屋又空又大，如果能請火先生住進家裏，照樣出租金；一方面由他每天敎兩三個鐘點書，不就親炙有味，很容易進步嗎？而况他的夫人趙女士，是嶄新文學家的前鋒；英文數學，各有根柢呀！這提議，常然片面而可笑，但未必沒有適合這一條件的對手。要是合意，可向明德女中接洽。不過這一事實，儘可反映出上海現狀，實在不允許一個詩人有立錐之地！倒是紅鬚綠眼的英雄，全做了此一時代的主要角色，一幕一幕地表演着自視爲聰明的小丑的傑作！</p>
<p>然而眞的生活苦痛的感受，　有着很大的代價的。我們雖道在這大時代裏忍心逃　為正義而所受的苦痛嗎？</p>

<h3>一星期家常菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>馬鈴薯，俗稱洋山芋，也是維他命很豐富的一樣好東西，西餐中當然少不了它，往往五六道菜，倒有三四道中要和它會面的。現在馬鈴薯也貴了不少，所以西餐館中可省則省，已不像從前那麼濫用了。馬鈴薯在家常菜中，總用來與咖哩雞作伴，近來吾家却利用它做大肉圓，因爲猪肉代價飛漲，一塊錢的肉，也沒有幾個肉圓好做，把馬鈴薯去皮打爛了，與肉末拌和，可以省去猪肉一半，做成了肉圓，用靑菜打底一同紅燒，風味倒也不惡。除此以外，還可利用它做素肉圓，只須把邊尖腐乾香菌等切細了，和打爛的馬鈴薯拌在一起，做成圓子紅燒，吃素的老太太們一定歡迎的。</p>

<h3>怎樣投考交通大學？</h3>
<p>— 涵</p>
<p>聊作識塗之第馬　非同敲門之泥磚</p>
<p>戰後上海中小學如雨後春筍，風起雲湧，但大學專校却多偃旗息鼓，作合併暫停之計。其幸存者，要亦文商爲多，理工實寥寥無幾，一向被人稱爲東南最高學府，有悠久歷史的交通大學，無疑地將爲數千有志於理工科的中學畢業生心目中最合理想的一所學府了。値此招考的前夕，筆者擬以校友的地位，爲數千投考諸君進一言。光講各科的考題的性質。</p>
<p>國文古奧艱深</p>
<p>國文在昔命題，純出四書五經為多。題義深奧，不略讀古書者對之，往往有不解題意之嘆，　論下筆。年來各方頗多物議，所以這位好古的主考先生，也得徇情變通，原題以外，再設近俗易解者一題，投考者可任擇其一。不過你得明白，這並非主考先生的文藝作風轉變之謂，諸位投考者若不是傳道講學？總得隨風使舵罷。</p>
<p>英文注意結構</p>
<p>英文亦以作文爲主。有數點値得注意。冷字不如俗字，長句不如短句，如揷入自謂可取的一段，而破壞了字句內的文法，還不如顧全了全文的結構。至於修辭學上的什麼辭藻，到不大注意。在中學裏你們或許曾經讀過莎士比亞，密爾教的大作，但在投考的時候，不要以爲搬了幾句放在你的文章裏會增加你文章的優點。</p>
<p>物理聲光力電</p>
<p>在中學裏，不論教師和學生，都有重視力學電學而輕看聲學光學的覜念。在實際應用上及爲了分配精力起見，我們或許不得不有所軒輊；但從應付考試的立塲來說，這個觀念，尤其在近年，是要不得的。近年來的物理考題，爲數較戰前减少，然試問那一年不包括聲光二學呢？惟投考者若能於普通中等化學書，像勃蘭克康納二氏或史密士所著的敎本讀完一冊，頗可應付。</p>
<p>算學特別注重</p>
<p>算學一門，包括代數，解析范氏本爲主，由胡敦復先生主考，今須輔以好兒奈脫之代數，方多把握。解析現專考平面，除去立體。其中關於切綫與椎切圖形兩童最爲重要。課本方面，可在劉乃氏及史密士蓋耳二書中任讀其一。他若溫德華氏或格蘭維氏所著解析，略而不詳，用以投考交大，還嫌不够。三角題目，爲數較少　　他若史地公民，無甚特色，從略。</p>
<p>今年電機機械土木三科各招四十人，報名者通常以土木略少，故錄取機會似較多。蓋土木設科，不僅交大一校，志在此者，可四出發展，初不必侷促於一隅也。</p>
<p>本文結束前，還得附添一句。各科成績，宜力求平均，切不可一科太劣，不然，一科在二十分以下，即有全功盡棄之虞。錄取標準，並無定見，視各科總平均爲取捨之準繩，惟稍偏重於理化算學，亦爲事實，故投考者不可於第一日所考自覺稍差，遽萌退志，將其後各科，輕易放棄。祗要平心靜氣，全力以赴，其庶幾焉。</p>

<p>「田麼……？」梅寳也眞想不到她會這樣不容氣的問到人家根脚上去，但自己當然是不能對她和盤托出來的。「大抵祇有十畝上下吧？說到做賣買的事，你瞧我爸爸是從來不走出村子的，還有什麽賣買可做呢？訊得咱們初來這裏的時候，箱子裏倒還藏着一些現錢，到目前却差不多全化完了。要問咱們的親戚，那就比什麼人家都少，除掉李家莊的叔公之外，我就不曾再見過一個……。」</p>
<p>「那末你的外婆呢？你的舅舅呢？」孟家的兒媳急不及待的揷嘴出來問。</p>
<p>「統沒有。媽很早……很早就死啦！」說這幾年來已這樣說慣了，要是突然再改變過來的話，孟家的媳婦也許第一個就會覺得詫異起來。</p>
<p>聽的人很同情地皺了皺眉頭。</p>
<p>「這樣說，你們家的景况也眞够苦的了。妹妹，不是我要說你，」說到這一句話，她就把自己坐的竹椅拉得更和梅寳靠近一些，臉上透出了極度機密的神氣，似乎底下的話，簡直有關這一村人的性命一樣。「你爸爸旣然沒有錢，你爲什麽還要去念什麼書呢？」木來，在她這樣的鄕村婦女的心理上，念書簡直就是玩兒。「譬方說你在家裏幫着做一些針綫，多少也就可以換幾個錢了。又且……」</p>
<p>不待她的話說完，梅實便搖頭了。</p>
<p>「這樣能賺多少錢呢？好嫂子，你要知道，念了書一樣也是可以賺錢的。譬如在咱們這兒的小學堂裹當一個先生？……」（一六三）</p>

<p>但是最主要的生活問題—飯—是不能一餐不煮的，着得油黑色的衣服，也是快不能再延擱下去不洗的，在這樣困難的情形下，我們就特地開了一個茶話會，公舉大哥爲主席，議決的結果凡十條：</p>

<h3>Soviet Parliament Issues Order: Stalin Appointed Minister of Defense, Mass Mobilization of Land and Air Forces to Prepare for Counteroffensive, Defend Moscow and Baku Oil Region</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 20th - The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union announced the appointment of Stalin, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, as Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union. Marshal Timoshenko, Commander-in-Chief of the Western Front, was appointed Deputy Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>International News Agency, Moscow, 20th - Stalin has personally taken command of the Red Army starting today, succeeding Marshal Timoshenko as Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union. Timoshenko will serve as Deputy Minister and is currently commanding the Central Soviet Army to defend Moscow. This adjustment has made Stalin the Supreme Commander of the Red Army. The order was issued by the Supreme Soviet Presidium and signed by Chairman Kalinin.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 20th - Yesterday, sources here reported that the Soviet Union had recently concentrated a large number of air force and mechanized units in the Moscow area to prepare for a counteroffensive. Both German and Soviet sources have not indicated that the German forces have successfully completely severed the northern and southern flanks of the Red Army. Confused reports state that, so far, the Germans have only made a large salient in the Polotsk and Nevel areas in the central sector. In the first four weeks of the war, the German army advanced 365 miles from Poland, averaging 23 miles per day. However, this momentum has decreased to eight miles per day after reaching the Soviet defense lines.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Stamford, 19th - A traveler from the Soviet Union claimed to have seen several divisions of the Red Army heading west from Moscow. Artillery and anti-aircraft artillery units were defending Moscow, with as many as twelve lines of defense. Traveling within the Soviet Union is currently quite difficult, he said.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Stockholm, 20th - German forces are launching flanking attacks on the northern and southern sides of Smolensk in an attempt to encircle the Red Army. The Red Army is still resisting as much as possible to delay the advance, in order to continue mobilizing troops. It is reported that three million troops are being concentrated east of Moscow, and new defensive fortifications are being built along the Volga River. Preparations for defense in the Ural Mountains area have also begun.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Stamford, 20th - According to diplomatic circles here, the Soviet Union has concentrated one million troops in Rostov (near the Caucasus region in southern Soviet Union and the Sea of Azov) to defend the area and prevent German forces from threatening the Baku oil region.</p>
<p>Four Major Areas: Fierce Battles Between Soviet and German Armies</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 20th - According to official communiqués, the Soviet Red Army and Hitler's forces have been engaged in fierce battles in four major areas of the Western Front from last night until this morning, fighting relentlessly throughout the night. The areas where these two major continental armies are clashing are: (1) the Pskov region on the Baltic Sea; (2) the Polotsk to Nevel area in Belarus; (3) Smolensk; (4) the Velikiye Luki area. Among these, the battle in the Smolensk region, the gateway to Moscow, is the fiercest. German mechanized units are fiercely attacking the stubbornly resisting Soviet defenders in an attempt to directly assault Moscow. There are no major developments on other fronts. The German army is apparently reinforcing heavily. Nevel, a railway center 45 miles northeast of Polotsk on the central front, is where the Germans are apparently trying to break through the salient point of the Soviet defenses in the north in order to advance rapidly. On the northern front of Moscow, the German army is still trying to defeat the Soviet defenders in Pskov and Porkhov in order to reach Leningrad directly. The Soviet Air Force also assisted in the battle at night, fiercely bombing the enemy's armored units on the front lines and the enemy troops moving east from the rear.</p>
<p>International News Agency, Moscow, 20th - It was announced here today that the Soviet army is successively dispatching large numbers of aircraft to the front lines to cover the land forces, fighting hard to slow down or stop the German army that is attacking Moscow fiercely from Smolensk. The Red Army High Command stated that German tank convoys, mechanized units, aircraft, and airfields have suffered significant damage. The damage is particularly severe along the Smolensk-Moscow railway line. The communiqué issued yesterday afternoon did not state whether the Soviet army was still holding its ground to resist the German offensive, but TASS stated that Red Army cavalry and Cossack troops had launched fierce counterattacks against the advancing German forces, rushing into the enemy's ranks and engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat. The Soviet side had previously stated that Soviet aircraft destroyed two troop transport ships and five oil tankers at the mouth of the Danube River. The Soviet communiqué also stated that fierce battles had been going on for three days and three nights south of Leningrad and Moscow.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th - Both Soviet and German communiqués state that there are fierce battles on all fronts, but neither offers any definite reports. The Soviet communiqué still states that there are fierce battles at locations 160 miles southwest of Leningrad, Smolensk, over 200 miles west of Moscow, and about 120 miles west of Kyiv. There is still no confirmation from other sources regarding the German claim of occupying Volynsk.</p>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 20th - German military circles stated yesterday that the entire front line of the Red Army has gradually disintegrated and German armored units are advancing towards Moscow along the highways, gradually posing a direct threat to the city. German armored units are reportedly less than 200 miles from Klin. According to German official sources, the German army is advancing towards Moscow, Leningrad, and Kyiv in three routes. At the same time, the German army is constantly forming pockets of encirclement against the Soviet army in the area between the Stalin Line and Moscow.</p>
<p>International News Agency, Berlin, 20th - The German High Command announced last night that after fiercely fighting and occupying Smolensk since Wednesday, the city is now a raging inferno. The Nazi offensive, aimed at the heart of the Soviet Union, is now advancing along the highway towards Moscow, reportedly only 200 miles away. Berlin sources say that the decisive battle is imminent. The communiqué stated that Major General Makarov, commander of the 11th Mechanized Corps of the Soviet Army, was captured. At the same time, when German troops stormed the headquarters of a Soviet division near Kyiv, they captured several Soviet staff officers.</p>
<p>German Troops Pass Through Sweden, Soviet Planes Bomb Finland</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 20th - According to sources here last night, the passage of a German division through Sweden has been completed. The Swedish authorities have ordered all railways to be freely available to the German army. No accidents occurred during the transit of the German troops, it is said.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Stockholm, 20th - Finnish troops north of Suoyarvi (on the north shore of Lake Ladoga) are still advancing towards the Lepola area in the northern part of the Soviet Karelia region, with the railway connecting Leningrad to the port of Murmansk as their ultimate goal. They have already pushed the Red Army back to a point ten kilometers east of Lepola. Finnish troops in the Karelian Isthmus are advancing towards Koivisto, located at the northern end of the Karelian Isthmus defense line, a key point for defending Leningrad. The Red Army has built two lines of defense in this area, indicating its importance. The Finnish military command has approximately seventeen divisions, of which fourteen are concentrated in the Karelian Isthmus in preparation for an attack on Leningrad, two are in the Salla area, and one is a reserve force. In the northernmost Murmansk area, the attack is being undertaken by German forces, and the Red Army's strength there is reportedly thirteen divisions.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 20th - According to sources here last night, German troops occupied a railway station south of Leningrad on Friday.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, somewhere on the German border, 19th - Military observers here state that Berlin is abuzz with rumors that the vanguard of the German army has reached the outskirts of Leningrad. At the same time, the official announcement speaks of staggering victories, either annihilating large numbers of Red Army troops or claiming that Leningrad or Moscow will fall imminently.</p>
<p>Reuters, Helsinki, 20th - On Friday and Saturday, many areas in eastern Finland were bombed by Soviet planes. According to the Finnish side, four Soviet planes were shot down.</p>
<p>Leningrad Fortress Has Strong Defenses</p>
<p>United Press, Helsinki, 20th - Sources here state that the target of one of the three main German forces attacking the Soviet Union is Leningrad. This fortress is said to be one of the largest fortresses in the world. Since 1937, Leningrad and the surrounding area have been a fortified region, similar to the Leningrad Military District. This fortified area covers 30,000 square kilometers and has a population of five million. The northern boundary of this region is the Gulf of Ladoga, the southern boundary is the city of Pskov, the western boundary is Lake Peipus and the Narva River, and the eastern boundary is Kholm and the Volkhov River. After the Soviet Union and Estonia signed a mutual assistance treaty in 1937, this region included non-essential Estonian strongholds. By the spring of 1940, it was further expanded to include new fortresses on Hango and areas in the Gulf of Finland. The garrison in Leningrad is said to number 600,000, divided into four corps, and has 3,000 aircraft. The Soviet fleet is also said to be part of the defense of this fortress, and the workers of Leningrad have formed a reserve army. The construction of this fortress has taken more than ten years, and the defenses are very strong. It has new airfields capable of housing 2,000 aircraft. In 1937, the fortress became a completely militarized zone. All foreign consulates were ordered to close, and foreigners were ordered to move out. All residents not needed for national defense were also selected to leave. Therefore, for several years, the Leningrad fortress has not leaked any information to the outside world, and the specific defensive fortifications cannot be seen by outsiders because most of them are built under buildings.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 20th - Moscow Radio broadcast last night that Hitler and Mussolini will meet in the Brennero Pass in a few days. It is said that this information came from reliable sources in a Central European country.

It is rumored that Hitler may allow Italian troops to occupy the French provinces of Corsica and Savoy.</p>

<h3>The Soviet-German War and the World After One Month</h3>
<p>The war between the Soviet Union and Germany will be exactly one month old tomorrow morning. To compete for this most important page in modern history, both sides have mobilized unprecedented military forces to engage in an all-out effort. As of now, although battle reports from both sides are contradictory and the situation on the front lines is extremely complex and confusing, it is undeniable that the German army has made some progress at a heavy price, posing a serious threat to the three important cities of Moscow, Leningrad, and Kyiv. After breaking through the Soviet defenses between Vitebsk and Mstislavl, the German army has penetrated deep and occupied Smolensk, threatening the Soviet capital. The Soviet side is making every effort to block the advance on one hand and attacking the German army's rear on the other, and both sides are continuing to wage fierce battles. However, even with Smolensk, the German army's most advanced point, being only 200 miles from the Soviet mainland border, the German army's achievement in this bloody battle is far superior to that of the Japanese army in the Shanghai-Songhu War, but far inferior to that of the previous summer on the Western Front, where it forced the Netherlands, Belgium, and France to collapse and surrender one after another in more than forty days. Moreover, in some areas, the positions of the two armies are intertwined, and the German army has not yet completely forced the Soviet army back within the old Soviet borders. Since the Nazis failed to encircle and annihilate the main Soviet forces in one fell swoop as they did in France last year, this strategy of penetrating alone is undoubtedly an excessive risk. After separately appointing the main generals for the three major war zones on the Western Front, Stalin also took on the role of Minister of Defense, combining party, government, and military power into one. With greater concentration of authority, command should be more convenient, and it is expected that he will be able to demonstrate great resistance and resilience in the great battle to defend Moscow. The Nazis not only failed to defeat the Soviet Union within six weeks, but as time goes on, the difficulties will inevitably increase and the progress will slow down. If this drags on, their future fate is very unpredictable.</p>
<p>The Soviet-German war is naturally the focus of the current world situation and the center of attention for people around the world. However, the future of this war must be a long-term war of attrition. Regardless of whether the situation in Moscow is by no means as hopeless as the fall of Paris last summer, even if the important cities in the western Soviet Union unfortunately fall, it will not be a decisive victory for the Nazis. As early as a few years ago, the Soviet Union had moved the center of its national defense and heavy industry to the east of the Ural Mountains. Under constant arduous management, it has been fully prepared to cope with a long-term war of resistance. Judging from the current war situation, the German army is disregarding the taboo of attacking fortified positions and advancing single-mindedly in the central sector. In the Kyiv sector of Ukraine, there has been no significant progress, and the oil depots will not fall into the hands of the Nazis intact. If Hitler's sudden attack on the Soviet Union was for the urgent need to replenish resources, it can be concluded that even if his attack on the Soviet Union succeeds by chance, his wishes will be difficult to fulfill. In the process of this war dragging on, the sacrifices and consumption of the Nazis will be extremely great. On the other hand, it will give the democratic countries more opportunities to prepare and strengthen themselves. It is believed that the combat power of Britain will soon reach a balance with that of the Nazis, and the counteroffensive that the world is waiting for may materialize.</p>
<p>Although the evolution of the international situation has been slightly slow in this month, the trend is worth being optimistic about. First, the Anglo-Soviet alliance was established. In addition to mutual assistance, they also mutually guaranteed not to make peace with the Nazis midway. This is probably the most unexpected thing for Hitler, and it was realized because the aggression and recklessness of the aggressors have no end. In recent days, the Soviet Union has also changed its previous cold and indifferent attitude towards countries other than Britain and the United States that are jointly resisting the Nazis, and has successively established diplomatic relations with them. Even with Poland, which has territorial disputes with the Soviet Union, it has once again emphasized the necessity of adjusting Soviet-Polish relations under British mediation. Second, the situation in the Atlantic has improved unprecedentedly. The number of British ships lost in the past month is almost the smallest since the start of the war, and the British ships have spare capacity to attack Axis ships. After the United States occupied Iceland, the supply of war materials to Britain has also been significantly guaranteed. Even if this is only a temporary phenomenon, its contribution to strengthening British strength is by no means small. Third, the British army took this opportunity to eliminate the remnants in East Africa and counterattack Bardia, consolidating the periphery of the Middle East. In particular, the successful conclusion of the Syrian war not only eliminated the fear of Turkey's defection, but also had significant implications for the joint British and Soviet protection of the Caucasus and the Persian Gulf. Fourth, the Japanese cabinet was reorganized due to diplomatic failures. The successor is indeed a military fascist cabinet preparing for war, but it is clearly more cautious towards the Axis alliance, which has aroused disappointment from the German side. On the side of the democratic countries, although outwardly extremely calm about the Far East, they are inwardly on high alert. The close cooperation of the A, B, C, D line has formed a strict precaution against aggressive attempts. Now, British and American public opinion is no longer as optimistic about the new Japanese cabinet as it was at first. Most people recognize its inherent serious implications. The British advocacy of identification marks for ships, the American preparations for blacklisting, Halifax's warning remarks, and the emergency meetings convened by the U.S. authorities are all precisely aimed at the brewing crisis in the Far East that is waiting for an opportunity to move.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that no matter how the Soviet-German war changes, the trend of the international situation is always developing towards a brighter direction. Since the aggressors ignited the flames of war ten years ago, they have encountered the strong resistance of the international coalition forces for the first time today. The evolution in this month, even if it has not been fully satisfactory—such as the slowness of the United Front's progress and the persistence of inaccurate understanding of the Far Eastern crisis—on the whole, it has already laid a victorious foundation for the victorious future of the anti-aggression war.</p>
<h3>National-Communist Friction Can Be Eliminated: Central Government Urges Communist Party to Comprehend, Jointly Resist Foreign Aggression Without Intention of Suppression; Zhou Enlai Appeals in Writing for Unity</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Reuters has learned from authoritative sources that the Chinese government has no intention of suppressing the Communist army. The reason for announcing the Communist army's provocative actions is based on the following reasons: (1) Since the New Fourth Army Incident, the Communist army has repeatedly attacked the Central Army on various front lines in the past few months, while the Central Army has been ordered not to take retaliatory actions. (2) Hoping that the Chinese Communist Party will cooperate with the government, as the communists in England and the United States naturally do, but the Chinese Communist Party is not doing this. Instead, they are strengthening their insidious activities. The Chinese government sent a special letter to Zhu De, hoping that the Communist Party would stop its hostile actions. This announcement will make this fact known to the world, so that the world and the situation can change the attitude of the Chinese Communist Party. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Official Restraint to Prevent Escalation of Disputes</p>
<p>Chongqing - The friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has been clearly and publicly exposed here today. The official side also released information describing the clashes between the Eighteenth Group Army and the Central Army. At the same time, a formal spokesperson for the Communist Party expressed doubts about the clash and called for unity in the war against Japan. Government officials also took appropriate steps to prevent the friction from developing further here and requested all newspapers not to publish comments on the matter, so that the government would have more opportunities to resolve the dispute. The only newspaper that failed to comply with the request not to comment was the Catholic Yishi Bao, which strongly condemned the alleged clash. The official information issued by the Military Affairs Commission was published by all newspapers except the Communist New China Daily. The official information stated that on June 25, the Eighteenth Group Army led by Zhang Aiping (transliteration) went to a certain county government, killed one section chief, kidnapped more than 70 members of the county police guard, and seized 234 rifles and 4 machine guns. The next day, the Eighteenth Group Army troops stationed in Donghuzhuang (transliteration), Baoxian (transliteration), Shandong Province, attacked the Chongqing guerrillas fighting the Japanese army in southwestern Shandong Province, killing dozens of guerrillas.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Enlai Urges Unity</p>
<p>Zhou Enlai, the chief representative of the Communist Party in Chongqing, published an article expressing doubts about whether there were indeed such clashes and calling for unity. The article began by saying, "I can clarify that according to the orders to participate in the Battle of Zhongtiao Mountain, the Eighteenth Group Army once attacked the Japanese army in the southeastern defense zone of Shanxi Province, but immediately retreated to its originally designated area after completing its task. The defense zones in Leling, Guiping (transliteration), and Huimin counties of Shandong Province were assigned to the Eighteenth Group Army by the central government. How can clashes occur with other Chinese army units? In fact, did any clashes occur? The Military Affairs Commission received the telegram on July 18 and published it on July 19. Not only did Zhu De not have time to reply, but I also did not receive any notification beforehand. This is the factual process. What we want is unity, not division, and all-out war, not internal strife."</p>
<p>Communist Party Does Not Believe Such Incidents Occurred</p>
<p>Here - The Communist Party office stated that it receives reports from the headquarters of the Eighteenth Group Army every day, but it has not received any reports regarding the clashes mentioned in the information. The office also stated that the so-called dare-to-die troops that attacked the Central Army somewhere are not subordinates of the Eighteenth Group Army, but troops of General Ye Xishan (transliteration). The two places in Shandong Province where the alleged attacks occurred have not had any Eighteenth Group Army stationed in the past two years. Both places are far to the north of the Yellow River. At the same time, the Communist Party here does not express surprise at this news and says that they believe there will not be serious consequences.</p>
<p>Another Report Speaks Confidently</p>
<p>At the same time, well-informed military sources revealed that the Eighteenth Group Army has been actively expanding in North China, so that the Central Army in many places in Hebei and Shandong provinces has been completely excluded by the Communist Party. It is said that the area north of the line from Xinyuan (transliteration) to Lishi in Shanxi Province and the uncaptured areas in western and eastern Shanxi are all controlled by the Communist Party. This area was designated by the government for the Eighteenth Group Army. In other words, in the province, except for the important railway areas and several cities in the hands of the Japanese army, the rest of the region is occupied by the Communist Party. The Communist Party now has two border areas as bases for additional activities, namely the northern part of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border area and the Hebei-Chahar-Shaanxi border area. There are also eight permanent activity bases, namely in northern Suiyuan, southeastern Shaanxi, northwestern Shaanxi, central Hebei, eastern Hebei, western Shandong, eastern Shandong, and northern Jiangsu. One source pointed out that the Communist Party's plan is 10% to fight the Japanese, 20% to fight the Kuomintang, and 70% to expand itself. Military sources say that this plan has resulted in a large area and caused incidents. (United Press, 20th)</p>
<h3>Lattimore Praises China's Astonishing Progress, Exalts President Chiang's Noble Character, Completing the National Salvation Undertaking Amidst Hardship, America Has a Deeper Understanding of China</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Political Advisor to Chairman Chiang, Owen Lattimore, arrived in Chongqing yesterday. Reporters visited Mr. Lattimore that evening, and he made the following remarks: "It is a great honor for me to serve under the great leader of China, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Looking at history, we can see that there are very few great leaders in the world, and among these few leaders, Chairman Chiang is not a stagnant figure. Chairman Chiang has been able to lead the nation in fighting against foreign aggression for many years, while at the same time making astonishing progress domestically. This is enough to prove the greatness of his character and the brilliance of his talent." When asked about his plans for China's resistance and reconstruction, and whether he had any special mission in coming to China this time, Lattimore replied, "My first task is to seek instructions from Chairman Chiang, and then accept the Chairman's instructions and take on the designated task." Regarding recent malicious rumors spread by certain parties, claiming that Lattimore's arrival would force China to end the war first, and that the United States had an urgent intention, Lattimore's words can be said to indirectly refute these rumors. When mentioning Chairman Chiang, he often referred to him as "my leader." Lattimore did not discuss China's administrative and political issues, saying, "I have been away from China for four years. As far as I know, in the past four years, all aspects of China's domestic affairs have made astonishing progress, and all sectors of the country have become more united. Regarding external rumors about China's internal political problems, Lattimore expressed a deep understanding, saying, "Although it is difficult to predict how China should solve its own problems, in fact, China's various problems are being handled under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, and there has already been great progress." When Lattimore talked about the attitude of the United States towards China, he was very excited. He said, "After China's heroic fighting for four years, the attitude of the United States towards China has changed from theoretical sympathy to a greater and deeper understanding. I recall when I returned to the United States from China at the beginning of the war, and I talked with Americans about the Sino-Japanese War, I strongly stated that China could never be conquered by other countries, but most Americans did not dare to believe this, thinking that my firm opinion was based on emotional considerations. But today, if anyone who doubted China four years ago were told that China would eventually collapse, they would certainly dismiss it as absurd. The majority of the American people deeply believe that after fighting under the wise leadership of Chairman Chiang, China has completed the great task of national salvation, China has become a stabilizing force in the Far East, and will eventually become an example for the entire Asia." When asked whether sympathy for China was due to the efforts of the Central Propaganda Department, Lattimore said, "Although this has played a minor role, the real reason is due to China's own achievements in resistance and reconstruction." Lattimore speaks Chinese and Mongolian fluently, but he is still modest and willing to spend several months practicing after arriving in Chongqing. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to reliable sources from Reuters, Chairman Chiang's private political advisor, Owen Lattimore, is expected to meet with Chiang Kai-shek this afternoon. Although Lattimore has lived in China for many years, this will be their first meeting. It is said that Lattimore plans to meet with other Chinese and American leaders after meeting with Chairman Chiang. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Issue of Women and Children Leaving Djibouti Under Discussion Between Britain and France</h3>
<p>Cairo, 20th (Reuters) - British authorities in Cairo have not yet received a reply regarding the request for women and children to leave Djibouti (capital of French Somaliland). Britain's only concern regarding the port is the use of the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway, as using this route can avoid motor transport vehicles crossing the mountainous areas of British Somaliland to Abyssinia, and these transport vehicles can be used elsewhere. The Djibouti authorities are apparently following Vichy's instructions, still hoping that Abyssinia will be a war zone, even though 90% of the goods transported into Abyssinia via the Red Sea are for civilian needs.</p>
<p>Vichy, 20th (Haitong News Agency) - Well-informed sources state that Britain and France are exchanging views on the issue of the disposition of French women and children in French Somaliland. The talks were initiated by a neutral country.</p>

<h3>Bumper Harvest of Food Crops Expected in Various Parts of Free China, Civilian Life Will Be Slightly More Stable, Prices of Goods Expected to Fall</h3>
<p>Chongqing - According to reliable sources in the interior, the food shortage in Free China has now passed. Although the harvest in each province may not be called a bumper harvest, it is believed that a 70% harvest can be guaranteed. There is only one month left until harvest, not only will the population of Free China have sufficient food next year, but there is also hope that rice prices will fall, making civilian life less difficult and slightly more stable. In the past two months, pork prices have fallen significantly.

<h3>Foreign Minister Guo Recognizes New Japanese Cabinet as a Semi-Military Organization Preparing to Seize Possible Interests from Britain and the United States, and Warns the United States Not to Appease Them Again</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 20th, United Press - Chinese Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi warned last night that the composition of the Japanese cabinet is intended to obtain the last possible benefits from Britain and the United States before making a final blow towards its ultimate goals in the Far East. Foreign Minister Guo told a United Press reporter that he noticed that there were many figures from the Japanese Navy and Army in the Japanese cabinet. Chinese experts on Japanese affairs believe that the Third Konoe Cabinet is a temporary semi-military organization to fully prepare for Japan's planned military actions. Chinese experts believe that when Japan is fully prepared and ready to launch an attack, the cabinet will give way to a true military government led by the military. Foreign Minister Guo also said that the characteristic of the new Japanese cabinet is that it is essentially a military cabinet on the one hand, but on the other hand, it still appears as a civilian government led by Konoe, so it can obtain the last possible benefits from Britain and the United States through the traditional policy of advocating "strengthening the moderate elements in Japan." Foreign Minister Guo said that this policy is nothing more than appeasement. Foreign Minister Guo said, "The Japanese cabinet is especially useful when dealing with the United States, because there are many idealists in the United States." When Foreign Minister Guo discussed the United States still supplying Japan with oil and other goods, he said, "This matter is very similar to Britain's policy of appeasement towards Italy, because after the start of the European war, Britain allowed Italy to store oil and other important raw materials, hoping to prevent Italy from uniting with Germany. As a result, Britain helped Italy arm itself to fight against itself. I believe that the United States' policy will also have the same result."</p>
<p>Chongqing, 20th, Taiwan Business News - Those Chinese people who are familiar with Japanese affairs claim that although the new Japanese Foreign Minister Toyoda has no reputation abroad, he belongs to the hard-line faction in the Navy. It is said that Toyoda served twice as a minor representative in the Japanese delegation to the London Naval Conference, but he opposed Japan's signing of the convention negotiated at the naval conference. Toyoda has always opposed Japan's agreement to the Washington and London Naval Treaties.</p>
<p>Central Daily News Discusses Japanese Military Trends</p>
<p>Chongqing, 20th, Reuters - According to well-informed sources here, since the reorganization of the Konoe Cabinet in Japan, there are three possible actions: (1) block Vladivostok and invade Siberia by land, (2) seize southern Vietnam and put renewed pressure on Thailand, (3) invade Yunnan Province to cut off the Burma Road. This morning, the Central Daily News published an article stating that Japan may attack north or south, and that the United States' position in the Pacific has been greatly enhanced due to recent international developments. There are now three possible routes that the United States may use to attack Japan, namely (1) the northern route via Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, (2) the central route via Hawaii, Wake Island, and Guam, (3) the southern route via Hawaii and Samoa. Japanese naval experts have always insisted that only the southern route is feasible, but the current situation is completely different. The close cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States has made the northern route also visible in practice. Moreover, because the United States is stepping up its defenses in the Pacific, the US Navy can not only ensure the safety of its ships along the central route but also effectively bomb the islands under Japanese rule. As for the United States' position along the southern route, it has been further strengthened due to the joint defense of Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, India, and Australia. In other words, whether Japan advances south or attacks north, it has little hope of achieving its goals. In addition, the Japanese new cabinet's announcement of its determination to resolve the China Incident has aroused speculation as to whether Japan is on the eve of launching another large-scale offensive against China. People here believe that since Japan is currently withdrawing its troops from the Yangtze River Basin, it is unlikely to attack Chongqing to the west. It is said that if the Japanese army advances westward from Shanxi Province, crosses the Yellow River, and attacks Xi'an, although it will bring the Japanese army deep into northwestern China, even if this offensive is successful, it will not be able to force China to abandon its resistance in the near future. Therefore, some people believe that Japan may use Vietnam as a base to attack Yunnan Province to cut off the Burma Road, so as to prevent the continuous arrival of American supplies in Chongqing. However, since Japan occupied northern Vietnam, the Chinese Supreme Command has taken all necessary precautions, and a strong Chinese army has been gathered along the Vietnamese border to deal with possible invasions of Yunnan Province. Not only will the United States make various efforts to maintain the opening of the Burma Road so that it can rush aircraft to help China's resistance, but it is expected that Britain will also take similar actions, because Japan's invasion of Yunnan Province will threaten the safety of Burma, the rear gateway to Singapore.</p>
<p>Chongqing Believes Japanese Government is Completely Fascist</p>
<p>Chongqing, 19th, Havas - This morning, all newspapers commented on the new Japanese cabinet, with the Ta Kung Pao being the most insightful and agreed upon by all parties. The newspaper said that the new Japanese cabinet is completely a war-preparedness cabinet, with soldiers accounting for seven of the fourteen cabinet members and no political party figures. This shows the deepening of military fascism. Once the war participation system is prepared, the cabinet must be reorganized again. As for the trend of participating in the war, it should be north first and south second. Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union should know that it is extremely stupid to wait for Japan to launch an attack before responding. It is extremely smart and sensitive to strike Japan first. If the United States continues to appease Japan by providing it with oil, steel, and other resources, then its crime of stupidity will reach the heavens. The newspaper also predicts that the new cabinet will not last more than two months.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th, Havas - Since the establishment of the new Japanese cabinet, political figures here have recently commented that the new Foreign Minister Teijiro Toyoda has no diplomatic experience and can only implement Konoe's policies. Therefore, Prime Minister Konoe will occupy an important position in the government's foreign policy. Although the outgoing Foreign Minister Matsuoka was the most powerful figure in supporting the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, Matsuoka's departure this time cannot be regarded as a loosening of Japan's relationship with the Axis powers. On the contrary, the Japanese government will repeatedly state that Japan's foreign policy will still center on the Tripartite Pact, and its obligations to the Axis powers will be explained in a moderate manner. According to Prime Minister Konoe's intention, when the Tripartite Pact was signed in September 1940, the Japanese Emperor issued an edict to the whole country, saying that the Tripartite Pact was an instrument to prevent the European war from spreading to the Far East. Based on this, the main direction of the new cabinet's foreign policy is to try its best to avoid a war between the United States and Japan. Even Prime Minister Konoe himself believes that the United States and Japan can at least temporarily maintain the status quo. If the situation can improve, further action should be taken. It is rumored that Japanese Ambassador to the United States Nomura attempted to establish a non-aggression treaty with the United States, which also originated from this. It is expected that Japan will not remain in a passive position. The important decision taken by the government at the Imperial Conference on July 2 was agreed upon in advance. It is difficult to announce the content of this decision at this time. However, the Japanese government has encountered an important problem, which is to prevent the conspiracy of "encircling Japan." The feeling of being surrounded by the Japanese Co-Prosperity Sphere is becoming increasingly obvious, and it will soon take all necessary measures to prepare for the worst. After Germany defeats the Soviet Union, the international situation will allow Japan to take action. According to the information received by the government, if the Soviet Union's resistance is defeated by Germany, the United States will no longer be able to pay attention to the port of Vladivostok. In addition, although the military occupies a majority in the new cabinet, extreme elements do not occupy key positions. Therefore, we should not overestimate the power of the military. Tojo is the most powerful figure in supporting Konoe's policies and still remains as Minister of the Army. Regardless of cabinet ministers Lieutenant General Yanagawa and Baron Hiranuma, both are conservative figures, while Minister of Health and Welfare Koizumi, who used to be a military medical officer, has no political color. There are also three people from the Navy in the cabinet: Admiral Oikawa as Minister of the Navy, Admiral Toyoda as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Vice Admiral Sakonji Seizo as Minister of Commerce and Industry. Foreign Minister Toyoda is very familiar with the diplomatic policies that the Japanese Navy and Army can implement.</p>
<p>Japanese Newspaper Believes There Will Be No Changes in the New Cabinet's Diplomacy</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th, Haitong News - According to the Japanese newspapers' elaboration and Prime Minister Konoe's statement after the cabinet reshuffle, the new Japanese cabinet will proceed in accordance with its previous policies. What the new cabinet is concerned about is the construction of Greater Asia. Regarding whether Japan's foreign policy is still based on the Tripartite Pact, the new Foreign Minister Toyoda said, "Our basic policy will never change." Prime Minister Konoe has made it clear. The Japan-Japan News stated that the new Japanese cabinet will further strengthen the policy of the Tripartite Pact. The new Japanese government is determined to follow a firm policy to solve the important problems facing Japan. The Sino-Foreign Commercial News stated that half of the Japanese cabinet members are representatives of the Navy and Army, which shows that Japan is standing at the gate of war. The Hochi Shimbun also expressed the same opinion, hoping that the Soviet-German war can enable Japan to quickly resolve the Sino-Japanese Incident.</p>
<p>American Newspapers Comment on the Policies of the New Japanese Cabinet</p>
<p>Washington, 20th, Reuters - Observers here generally believe that Matsuoka's departure from the Japanese cabinet is the most important change in Tokyo. However, it is difficult for commentators to estimate the significance of the change of Japanese Foreign Minister because the successor is a person whose political views are not known. The Washington Post stated that Matsuoka's departure does not necessarily mean that Japan's relationship with the Axis powers will change rapidly. However, Matsuoka has made his country subject to the realization of policies that have proven to be contradictory and feels ashamed, so he resigned. It is expected that Japan will still sit on the fence until it sees that the benefits of its aggressive policies outweigh the harms. However, this waiting opportunity may not be very long, because Japan's only business today is to fight, and other considerations are not important. The New York Bulletin stated that it knows nothing about the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet except that Konoe obtained the consent of the Navy and Army to launch the cabinet reshuffle in order to remove Matsuoka. Matsuoka must have promised Hitler to attack Siberia. Hitler may not want Japan to attack the Soviet Union from both sides now, and Japanese army leaders may not be willing to fight the Soviet army in the Far East with their limited troops and resources. The only thing that can be believed is that Matsuoka has promised Hitler that Japan will cause great disturbance in the Pacific. Now that Japan is not prepared to do so and wants to withdraw its previous words, it can only remove Matsuoka from office. The new Japanese cabinet is not a peace cabinet. Its members are mostly naval and army personnel, which shows that it is determined to expand. However, its planned expansion cannot give Germany much comfort. It is a sign of Japan's southward advance that a naval officer is in charge of diplomacy, because the southward advance is where the Navy's ambition lies and is also the task of Konoe's new cabinet. However, the actions of the Japanese Navy do not completely follow Hitler's lead, but only engage in expansion when it is harmless. Now, no matter what actions Japan takes in Vietnam and Thailand to prepare for more intense actions against the United States in the future, Japan's foreign policy will temporarily remain uninteresting, just like its new foreign minister is uninteresting.</p>
<p>Britain Believes Japan Will Soon Attack Thailand and Vietnam</p>
<p>London, 19th - London and Washington are closely watching the development of the situation in Tokyo, because the measures of the new cabinet are enough to affect the situation in the Pacific. Observations here suggest that if there are no other major unexpected changes, Japan's invasion of Vietnam and Thailand is only a matter of time and will be seen in a few days. Although Germany is urging Japan to attack the Soviet Union from both sides, Japan seems determined to adopt an independent opportunistic policy. The benefits must be limited to Japan alone. Japan is in dire need of oil, rice, tin, and rubber. There are many of these materials in the South Pacific, but Siberia lacks them. Japan's war against China has become thorny, and it is unwilling to launch a large-scale war to avoid falling into an uncontrollable situation again. Japan has experience with the Soviet Union in the Changkufeng Incident. The Soviet Union's heroic resistance against the German blitzkrieg has also lasted for four weeks. Japan should also know that the danger of attacking Siberia is great. On the contrary, if Japan implements a southward advance without causing conflict with Britain and the United States, the resistance it encounters will be weak, and it may even encounter no resistance. Japan knows that Britain and the United States will oppose Japan's occupation of naval and air force bases in Thailand and Vietnam, which will endanger Singapore and affect the strategic situation in the South Seas. However, Japan also believes that Britain and the United States will not take positive measures against Japan merely for this reason. Japan expects that Britain and the United States may unite to implement economic measures to deal with Japan (this matter is said to be under discussion by British and American authorities), but Japan is clearly prepared to resist the joint economic measures of Britain and the United States. Japan recently deliberately spread the rumor of a Sino-British military alliance to test the reaction of Britain and the United States to Japan's occupation of Vietnam and Thailand. It is expected here that after Japan occupies Vietnam and Thailand, it will wait for an opportunity before implementing the second step of its plan. This matter will largely depend on the outcome of the German-Soviet war.</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies Pays Close Attention to the Reshuffle of the Japanese Cabinet</p>
<p>Batavia, 20th, United Press - Dutch people have not commented much on the reshuffle of the Japanese cabinet in the past two days. One of the leaders said that the reshuffle of the Japanese cabinet is to show that Japan's policy will become purely Japanese in nature, and this change may be even worse. The official also said that this change of the Japanese cabinet further shows that the Nazis have obviously lost power in Japan. However, in any case, we should strictly adhere to an independent policy. Even if the number of military personnel in the Japanese cabinet increases, we do not care. In general, it is recalled that the Netherlands recently refused Japan's request because it feared that exported goods would be transshipped to Germany. The meaning of the remarks of a Dutch official today must be to maintain the right to independent negotiations regardless of Japan's new policies, and not to be subjected to military pressure. Dutch people here also said that the words of British Far East Commander General Brooke-Popham, "We are already prepared," can represent the attitude of the Dutch East Indies.</p>

When Shigemitsu was the ambassador to China, Toyoda was the Director of the Naval Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Navy. Shigemitsu also refused to talk about the British-German war, only saying that the German air force's bombing of London was more dramatic than generally imagined. He said that the Japanese Embassy in London and other Japanese properties had been hit by German bombs.</p>

This bill has recently been reviewed and passed by the Senate Armed Services Committee, and a report has been submitted to the Senate stating, "If the purchase of national defense supplies encounters obstacles and cannot proceed quickly, it will inevitably cause serious consequences. Because the threat to the United States is increasing, mobilizing industry to manufacture equipment needed by the army is urgent, otherwise, it will be enough to weaken our army's strength. What modern warfare shows us is that slow preparation is enough to invite aggression. Only with full preparation can war be eliminated." It is learned that the Senate is scheduled to submit this bill for discussion on the 11th of this month.</p>

<p>Vichy, 19th, Havas - Well-informed sources said that Darlan's meeting with Sato was of no great significance. Generally, Ambassador Sato informed Associate Darlan of the reshuffle of the Japanese cabinet. Since the new Japanese Foreign Minister, Admiral Toyoda, is a naval general, observers are paying close attention to the development of the situation in the Far East. Also, because Vietnam's status has not changed so far, and France still has extensive interests in Asia, people are paying more attention to this. However, observers believe that Japan's future actions will still focus on China.</p>
<p>Saigon, 20th, Reuters - It is learned that Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux is scheduled to return to Hanoi from Saigon on Monday with all his entourage. It was previously rumored that Governor Decoux would stay in Saigon as usual to escape the summer heat until the end of August.

It is estimated that Governor Decoux will meet with the Japanese delegation to the border survey committee, as the Japanese representatives will arrive in Haiphong today.</p>
<p>Saigon, 20th, Reuters - Officials explained the reason why Governor Decoux will suddenly return to Hanoi on Monday, saying that Governor Decoux has been away from Hanoi for a long time and has accumulated a lot of official duties, so he needs to go there to handle them. He should be able to return to Saigon in mid-August. Yesterday, two important officials came to Saigon to report everything to Governor Decoux.</p>

Although the official communiqué announced the appointment, no Paris newspaper published it.</p>
<p>Vichy, 20th, Haitong News - A communiqué issued after yesterday's cabinet meeting stated that as a result of the meeting, no proposal to reorganize the French cabinet was passed.

<h3>Howarth Advocates Delaying Export Tax on the Philippines</h3>

The advertisement stated that over two million people rely on the sugar industry for their livelihood, and they will be affected if the export tax is not suspended. Now there is a country contemplating invasion, and if we cause discord by failing to maintain food and other daily necessities, it would be giving the aggressor a special invitation.</p>

<h3>Even if the Far Eastern Situation is Extremely Serious, Shanghai's Status Will Not Change; Its International Character Must Exist; The Legal Rights and Interests of the Chinese People Should Be Respected and Protected.</h3>
<p>Although the Japanese cabinet reshuffle appears more moderate on the surface, the fact that Konoe, who has a close relationship with the military, has succeeded as prime minister indicates that Japan will sooner or later take another military action, with a southward advance being particularly likely. Therefore, the Far Eastern situation has reached a new turning point. Shanghai's status, due to the outbreak of Pacific warfare after Japan's southward advance, is even more closely related to the millions of Chinese people in this city. The opinions expressed on this issue by a foreign commentator in this city are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Status Quo of Shanghai Must Be Maintained</p>
<p>Regardless of how rapidly the international situation changes, the status quo of Shanghai must always be maintained. Even if the conflict between the United States and Japan breaks out in full force, Shanghai's international character must be ensured. Before the war, some people advocated abolishing Shanghai's international character, but if anyone still sings this tune today, it is tantamount to falling into the trap of treacherous people, destroying Shanghai's legal status of the past century in one fell swoop. If there is no resolute determination to prevent such a latent possibility from occurring, the future holds endless hidden dangers. Especially when the overall situation tends to change, we must be careful to maintain Shanghai's traditional status quo.</p>
<p>The Interests of the Chinese People Should Be Respected</p>
<p>The so-called maintenance of Shanghai's international character, as far as the current situation is concerned, has the following implications: (1) The balance of power between the various countries in Shanghai must continue; (2) All countries must have equal opportunities for industrial and commercial development in Shanghai; (3) The rights enjoyed by the expatriates of all countries in Shanghai, even if the environment is not equal, must not be used as a basis for benefiting oneself at the expense of others; (4) The administrative power of the concessions should maintain its consistent independence, and all matters should be handled impartially without favoritism; (5) Make every effort to suppress terrorist cases of any background, so as not to create an excuse favorable to any party; (6) The legitimate interests of the Chinese people must be respected and protected as before the war. To summarize the above six points, Shanghai must do its best to remain neutral at present, and not allow the power of any country or any party to develop in a special and deformed manner.</p>
<p>Compromise and Appeasement Are Absolutely Not Advisable</p>
<p>The countries related to Shanghai themselves may lose their neutrality due to sudden changes in the situation and the sudden outbreak of war, but in their relations with Shanghai, they must continue their consistent policy of maintaining a balance of power, and must not willingly compromise and appease, so that other countries or forces may have a chance to take the lead. In other words, Shanghai's status quo should not change due to changes in the international situation, but should stand in a detached position and continue to develop and progress in a satisfactory manner. Otherwise, the situation in Shanghai will inevitably deteriorate day by day, to the point of being irreparable. The legitimate rights and status of both Chinese and Westerners will be wiped out.</p>
<p>The Positions of Britain and the United States Must Be Firm</p>
<p>In essence, the two sides of Shanghai's balance of power are Britain, the United States, and other countries that adopt the same position as Britain and the United States, and Japan and its affiliated forces, as well as its allies, Germany and Italy. The extent to which the current balance of power is maintained is well known, but the future balance of power depends on the attitude of Britain and the United States. In other words, if the balance of power in Shanghai is to be maintained, Britain and the United States must not take any appeasement or compromise measures in Shanghai due to changes in the international situation. Otherwise, appeasement will become submission, and compromise will become indulgence. Not only will their own rights and interests be completely eliminated, but the entire situation in Shanghai will be in dire straits and beyond salvation.</p>
<p>Citizens Must Be Vigilant and Aware</p>
<p>The vigilance and awareness of the citizens of Shanghai itself are also conducive to maintaining the situation in Shanghai. In other words, the citizens of Shanghai should be determined to suppress any events that may occur that are sufficient to change the situation in Shanghai, and should use strong public opinion to counter any special expansion of any force. The spiritual strength of the people cannot be destroyed by military intimidation and massacre. Therefore, in order to ensure the safety of Shanghai's future, on the one hand, Britain and the United States must take the initiative to eliminate the root of compromise and appeasement, and on the other hand, it must be promoted and supported by the spiritual power of the people.</p>
<h3>U.S. Red Cross Concerned About Refugees, Wheat Arrives in Shanghai Today, to Be Distributed in This City and Occupied Areas</h3>
<p>According to reports from the local economic associations, the American Red Cross has been informed that there is an urgent need for medical supplies and relief wheat. In addition to rushing a shipment of medicines worth US$1 million, the Arleigh, weighing 6,751 tons, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today, carrying 2 million pounds of crushed wheat and 50,000 pounds of milk powder, commissioned by the Red Cross. The ship came from Seattle on June 15th and could have arrived here on the 19th, but the voyage was delayed due to bad weather. Following this, the Capillo (weighing 3,127 tons), which was ordered from Seattle to carry 20,000 pounds of crushed wheat to Shanghai, is also expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 25th of this month. These relief supplies will be distributed separately in Shanghai and the occupied areas. It is also learned that since the departure of President Pierce with Mr. Sanders, the president of the association, the vacancy here will be temporarily filled by Mr. Garda. The new president, Mr. Anderson, will arrive in Shanghai by the end of next month to take office.</p>
<h3>Abundant Harvests in Thailand and Vietnam Reduce the Cost of Foreign Rice; Hong Kong Rice Awaits Opportunity to Restore Original Price</h3>
<p>According to shipping industry sources, the Thai ship Sisinnon and the French ship Grand Datana entered the port yesterday, loading Siamese rice and Saigon rice respectively, totaling more than 80,000 bags, a quantity rarely seen recently. The city's rice reserves have increased further, already exceeding 1.2 million bags. It is heard that this year's output of foreign rice in Thailand and Vietnam is very abundant, and the market price has fallen. Rice importers find the cost favorable and have recently placed many new orders. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands more bags will arrive by the end of the month. The price of rice is bound to plummet. The Shanghai Municipal Council's price limit will also have to be restored to the original price of 310 yuan per picul.</p>
<p>Goods Arrive in Swarms, Market Prices Unstable</p>
<p>Since the authorities of the two concessions adopted both standard and expedient measures to actively stabilize the food supply for the people in this city, the various measures have shown effective results. Not only are the sources arriving in swarms, and the reserves have increased sharply, but large households hoarding goods have lost their grip. The prices of various types of rice present a fluctuating and unstable situation. Therefore, the hidden dangers in the food supply for the people of this city have been completely resolved. Rice speculators will inevitably suffer a serious blow. However, the two authorities are determined to adhere to their original intention and continue to adopt effective measures to stabilize the entire food supply, in order to reduce the burden on the common people by gradually lowering the price of rice and ensuring social security. A reporter from the Xin She News Agency learned from the Jianghai Customs yesterday that:</p>
<p>Rice Arrivals in Six Months</p>
<p>From June of this year, a total of 436,556 hectoliters of foreign rice were shipped to Shanghai from Myanmar, Annam, Thailand, etc., worth 4,271,150 gold units, equivalent to 11,562,003 yuan in national currency. Myanmar accounted for the most, with 242,374 hectoliters, worth 2,411,649 gold units. Second was Annam, with 177,703 hectoliters, worth 1,700,097 gold units. Third was Thailand, with 3,009 hectoliters, worth 50,099 gold units. As for the six months from January to June of this year, a total of 4,048,448 hectoliters of foreign rice were shipped to Shanghai from overseas, worth 30,843,540 gold units, equivalent to 83,493,463 yuan in national currency. In terms of the destination of rice this year, the reserves of various Chinese and foreign rice warehouses should be considerable. The daily rice needs of the four million Chinese and foreign residents, where is there a shortage?</p>
<h3>Greek King's Birthday Yesterday, Greek Community Celebrates Enthusiastically, Vows Loyalty to Support Revival</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 50th birthday of King George II of Greece. The Greek community in this city celebrated enthusiastically. The Greek Consulate General in Shanghai and other institutions flew flags and took a holiday. The entire Greek community in Shanghai pledged loyalty to the government of their motherland and continued to donate generously to meet the needs of the Greek Red Cross and other organizations.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in the U.S. Jointly Subscribe to Half of the Yunnan-Burma Railway Bonds</h3>
<p>In order to build the Yunnan-Burma Railway, the National Government, together with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications, issued US$10 million in Yunnan-Burma Railway Gold Public Bonds of the Republic of China in 1941, with a fixed interest rate of 5% per annum, with principal and interest paid once every six months. Only interest will be paid for the first three years, and principal will be repaid once from 1944, and will be paid off in 25 years, with the profits of the Yunnan-Burma Railway as the fund. According to a reporter from the Ping Ming News Agency's inquiry to the financial community, the Yunnan-Burma Railway Gold Public Bonds have been approved by the U.S. government for issuance in the U.S. The amount subscribed by overseas Chinese in the U.S. has exceeded US$5 million. However, these bonds are currently being printed and can be exchanged for bonds with the subscription form upon completion of printing. The interest will be calculated from July 1st.</p>
<h3>Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Fund, Social Support is Increasingly Strong; Mr. Huang Yuzhai Encourages Friends and Relatives to Donate, Enthusiastic Readers Express Touching Opinions</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the ninth day of soliciting donations for the Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Fund, which coincided with a Sunday, and a large amount of donations poured in, approaching 1,000 yuan, which is the highest record. If the readers can use this spirit of continuous efforts to promote any social undertaking, it can be guaranteed that it will be successful.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Donation Records</p>
<p>The largest donation yesterday was 500 yuan from Mr. Huang Yuzhai, 300 yuan from Lian Ji, 50 yuan from Mr. Li Renting, 40 yuan from Mr. Zhu Wenkui, 33 yuan and 5 jiao from Gu Qiying’s wife, Fang Xiude, Wang Wenjie, Zhang Yongling, Zhou Maojun, Dai Wenhai, Tu Qiwu, Lu Xiuyu, Fu Boliang, Yang Shunbao, and Zhu Youlong. 20 yuan from Mr. Wu Peicheng, 10 yuan from Mr. Huang Hui, 10 yuan from Yang Ruxiang for the wedding of Qian Xin Zhi, Wen Lang, and Qian Ting. 2 yuan from Mr. Zhang, and 1 yuan from Ms. Liu Jieding, and 1 yuan from Mr. Chen Bingnan. The total amount is 967 yuan and 5 jiao. The previous balance was 4,603 yuan, 6 jiao, and 2 fen, totaling 5,571 yuan, 1 jiao, and 2 fen.</p>
<p>Appealing to Friends and Relatives to Save Money to Help Students</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Yuzhai, the owner of Huizhong Bank, who donated the most yesterday, wrote in a letter: "Yuzhai was born in a poor family and lost his schooling at a young age. I empathize with others and have many feelings. Although I have established several charity schools, I am still unable to make it widespread due to limited resources. I have always regretted this in private. Although I am now somewhat self-reliant, I feel uneducated and guilty as soon as I enter the world. Now that the national crisis is not over, there are tens of millions of young people who have lost their schooling, and there are many pillars of future society among them, just like Yuzhai, who are suffering from bad circumstances. Shen Bao is where I used to work, and we are closely related. Now I am launching the Reader Scholarship Fund to benefit poor students. I am very excited to hear about it. I should have taken the lead and run around to solicit donations, but I am still unable to travel because I am recovering from a serious illness. Therefore, I dare to use a corner of this newspaper to respectfully tell my friends and relatives on behalf of thousands of students, please donate as much as you can, so that you can accumulate small amounts to make a fortune, enrich the donation, and reduce the number of people who drop out of school. Yuzhai has both money and lacks strength, and although he has a lot of heart, he is mostly ashamed. Therefore, I saved 500 yuan in fees to do my part. It is really not enough to say that I am advocating, but among my new and old friends, there are many wealthy people. At this time of the hot summer, the amount consumed by mouth can be deducted and used as a donation, and the amount should also be considerable. Yuzhai is willing to lead the way and bow his head to thank the thousands of students who have dropped out of school."</p>
<p>An Ama Sells Newspapers, Her Ambition is Commendable</p>
<p>Liu Jieding, an ama who works as a maid in a Westerner's house on Xianhe Temple Road in Shanghai, donated the proceeds from selling old newspapers yesterday to help students, and said, "I did not study much when I was young, and I am very ashamed to be a nanny for Westerners' children. I am very supportive of the scholarship fund mentioned in the newspaper. I have two sons and two daughters who are studying in the free area of eastern Zhejiang, and they often receive assistance from others. I deeply feel that this work is urgent." Mr. Li Renting also wrote in a letter: "If we can provide more assistance to ambitious students outside the school circle, it will be more effective than those in school, because they have personally experienced difficult circumstances and their motivation to move forward is very strong."</p>
<p>Ms. Gu Qiying from Sa Po Sai Elementary School has already solicited donations for the scholarship fund for the third time yesterday, working hard for the disaster-stricken children. Her enthusiasm and perseverance are truly admirable. Her father, Mr. Gu Dadong, provided guidance from the side, which also contributed to the family education.</p>
<h3>Small Bugs Found in Tap Water</h3>
<p>Many small bugs have been found in the tap water of the Public Concession. There are both brown and red ones. The residents are deeply concerned that this may be detrimental to hygiene, especially during the hot summer. The company also admitted that these kinds of bugs exist, but said that they are actively working to eliminate them, and firmly believe that these bugs will not have any impact on health.</p>
<h3>Commercial Press Reopens Today, Severance Pay Has Been Fully Paid, Great Eastern Labor Dispute Unresolved</h3>
<p>The entire staff of the Commercial Press General Distribution Office on Henan Road, the Xiafei Road branch on Jing'an Temple Road, and the various printing plants, plate-making factories, warehouses, etc., totaling about 1,000 people, have been suspended from work for three months due to demands for better treatment. Subsequently, a contract was signed under the supervision of the authorities by both labor and management to comply. It is heard that about 500 people were laid off this time, and only 402 were retained. The severance pay paid by the museum was about 800,000 yuan. Now, the retained museum staff have completed the internal reorganization, and it has been decided that they will officially resume normal business starting today.</p>
<p>Great Eastern Labor Dispute</p>
<p>All the messengers of the Great Eastern Telegraph Company at 34 Edward Road launched a go-slow strike at noon the day before yesterday (Saturday) because they were dissatisfied with the company's refusal to issue a year-end bonus from London. However, yesterday was Sunday, and the company was closed as usual. The two sides did not negotiate, so the labor dispute is still deadlocked.</p>
<h3>To Go to Beidaihe for Summer Vacation, Approval Must Be Obtained in Tanggu</h3>
<p>The U.S. Consulate General here recently received information from the U.S. Consulate General in Tianjin that travelers from Shanghai to Tanggu and Qinhuangdao can obtain permission to go to Beidaihe for summer vacation in those two places. Those who stay in Beidaihe for less than a month can be allowed to return to Shanghai with permission. If they plan to stay longer, they must obtain approval from the Tianjin authorities.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Fined for Selling Pig Iron to Chinese, License Revoked</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language "Continental New Daily," Nagashima Koyoriji, a 57-year-old Japanese man residing at 130 Peng Road in Hongkou, was recently found by the Economic Police of the Japanese Consulate General to have sold a large amount of pig iron to Chinese people. On the 14th of this month, he was punished by having his business license revoked. It is claimed that the Japanese man established an iron factory at 456 Kunming Road in Yangshupu in September 1938. Because he saw that trading with the Chinese side was more profitable, he continuously sold pig iron to Chinese merchants from March to June of this year, totaling more than 300 tons. He could earn a net profit of 600 yuan per ton more than trading with Japanese merchants.</p>
<h3>Most of the Real Estate Along the Bund is Being Prepared for Sale, Soaring Market Prices are the Main Reason for the Transactions, Not Related to the Future of the Far Eastern Situation</h3>
<p>According to well-informed sources, as of yesterday, the sale of the Grosvenor House on the Bund has not yet been formally completed and should be completed within the next few days. According to real estate market news in this city, most of the land along the Bund is currently being negotiated for sale and is in the final stages. However, according to investigations, not all of the real estate being sold recently belongs to British property. There are also many American and Chinese properties. However, the owners are unwilling to disclose the news of the sale, so the outside world does not know the truth. Recently, the sale of the property at 160 Edward Road and the vacant lot next to the Zhang Garden swimming pool on Jing'an Temple Road, the transfer of the Cathay Mansion, and the negotiation of this Grosvenor House have caused various rumors, and it is suspected that the real estate being sold belongs to British and American people, which is not without speculation about the future of the Far Eastern situation. However, according to people in the market, the recent activity in real estate sales is purely due to the high profits.</p>
<h3>The Anti-Aggression War Has Entered a Bright Path, The Establishment of the British-Soviet Alliance Greatly Boosts Morale, The Defeat of the Axis Powers is Imminent, Commentary by the Russian Newspaper Zaitsev</h3>
<p>A Russian-language newspaper in this city published an article yesterday, clearing up the international situation in recent weeks. The author, Zaitsev, is an expert in international affairs. The various issues mentioned are very concise. His feelings and perceptions reflect the Soviet Union's attitude towards the situation. Here is a translation of the original text:</p>
<p>The Time for Settlement with Germany Has Arrived</p>
<p>The major developments in the international situation in recent weeks are as follows: (1) Britain and the Soviet Union signed a military agreement, stipulating that neither party will separately make peace with Germany and will fight side by side until Nazism is annihilated. Therefore, the establishment of this treaty will inevitably boost the morale of the people suffering under Hitler's shackles. This is tantamount to showing them that the day for settlement with Hitler has arrived. (2) The brave Red Army has repeatedly dealt blows to the German army. The number of tanks, aircraft, and military supplies lost by the Germans is countless. The number of soldiers killed and wounded is also in the millions. Hitler will no longer be able to deceive himself with blitzkrieg tactics. The Red Army has succeeded in counterattacking in several places, and the German army is on the eve of collapse. Looking to the future, the butcher will shiver in the cold. The Soviet border will probably serve as the tomb of the Hitler Party.</p>
<p>Japan Seems Likely to Advance Southward in the Future</p>
<p>(3) Although Konoe's resignation and cabinet reshuffle have not announced Japan's future policy, judging from various signs, Japan seems to have the intention of advancing southward, eyeing opportunities and preying on the weak. Vietnam and Thailand have probably become its targets. (4) The United States occupies Iceland and builds naval and air bases. In the future, Hitler will only be able to sigh in vain when he wants to expand his power in the Atlantic Ocean. (5) The British occupation of Syria and the signing of a treaty with the Vichy government's official in Syria have made it impossible for the Axis powers to develop in the Near East in the near future.</p>
<p>The Chinese Army Will Launch a Counterattack Soon</p>
<p>(6) After China obtained a large number of aircraft from the United States, the strength of the Chinese Air Force has doubled. China will use the assistance of the new air force to launch a counterattack in the shortest possible time. (7) The United States is constantly encircling Japan in the South China Sea and is acting in concert with Britain, determined to protect the safety of the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>The Western Front is Favorable to Britain</p>
<p>(8) British aircraft repeatedly attacked Germany, causing great losses to the Ruhr area and western Germany. (9) The Atlantic war situation has become more favorable to the Allied forces. The British army's resistance is strong, and the German side will no longer be able to sink large numbers of British ships. (10) The production of aircraft, tanks, and weapons in the United States has increased sharply. Recently, the British army has been able to overwhelm the enemy with its superior air force on various fronts. (11) The resistance in the areas occupied by the German army is increasing day by day, and the anti-Soviet war is even more despised by the nations under its enslavement. To sum up, the whole world has awakened and is now carrying out the great cause of anti-fascist freedom and liberation. These conditions of struggle have made the situation of assisting the Allied countries increasingly bright. The Axis countries will have major political and military failures in the near future. We can wait and see.</p>
<h3>American Reporter Steel to Go to Moscow</h3>
<p>Steel, the Chicago Daily News correspondent in the Far East, will travel to Moscow recently. Steel was previously a reporter for the New York Times in Beiping. During the Sino-Japanese War, he traveled to Java, Thailand, Burma, and India from time to time. He recently returned to Shanghai from a trip on the Yunnan-Burma Road. It is rumored that his vacancy will be filled by Stuart Emeny, who is currently en route to Shanghai. According to reports, Emeny is also a famous reporter. Several years before the European War, he served as the head of the Paris bureau of the New York World, and won the Pulitzer Prize. Later, he served as a reporter for the Chicago Daily News and witnessed the German invasion of Norway, and then dispatched sensational news dispatches from there and Finland. Later, he served as a political reporter for a radio station.</p>
<h3>Origin of Buddhism</h3>
<p>The 19th session of the Rong Wu Sutra Study Society, Mr. Yang Zhongyi lectured on the origin of Buddhism. The founder of Buddhism, Shakyamuni, in Chinese means "Capable Benevolence," surnamed Gautama, named Siddhartha. His father was King Suddhodana, ruler of Kapilavastu, and his mother was Maya, daughter of the ruler of Koliya. He was born on the eighth day of the fourth month of the fifteenth year of King Ling of the Zhou dynasty, which is 58 BC in the Western calendar, under a Sala tree in Lumbini Garden, according to the Essentials of Eastern History and the Dictionary of Important Events. The Essentials of History states that his father died in the second year of King Jing, which is 543 BC, which is close to the legends of Ceylon and Tibet, and therefore credible. Some also say he was born in the fifth year of King Jing, or the 27th year of King Xiang. Xie Cheng's "Chronicles of the Later Han Dynasty," Wei Shou's "Treatise on Buddhism and Taoism," and Fei Changfang's "Three Records of the Kaihuang Era" all state that he was born in the tenth year of King Zhuang, or the seventh year of Duke Zhuang of Lu, when a comet was seen in the Spring and Autumn Annals as an auspicious sign. During the Six Dynasties period, the legend of Lao Tzu transforming the barbarians became widespread, and they competed for precedence, pushing the date further and further back, leading to the reigns of King Huan and King Ping. In the second year of the Zhenguan era of the Tang dynasty, an edict ordered Fa Xianglin to further push the birth back to the reign of King Zhao of the Western Zhou, and there were even claims of birth during the reigns of King Wu Yi of the Shang dynasty and Jie of the Xia dynasty, with the birth year differing by as much as a thousand years, which is astonishing! See Yang Jianxing's "Examination of the Birth Year of Shakyamuni" for details.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the accounts of the introduction of Buddhism into China that can be verified are Yuan Hong's "Chronicles of the Later Han Dynasty" and Fan Ye's "Book of the Later Han Dynasty, Records of the Western Regions," which state: "It is said that Emperor Ming dreamed of a golden man and asked his ministers. Some said, 'In the West, there is a god named Buddha.' Thereupon, he sent envoys to India to inquire about the Buddhist doctrines, and subsequently obtained images in Chinese books. Prince Ying of Chu was the first to believe in his arts." Neither book provides a specific year, and the "Buddhist Ancestor's Comprehensive Record" of Zhi Pan of the Song dynasty sets it as the tenth year of Yongping. However, the "Comprehensive Record of Buddhist Ancestors Through the Ages" sets it seven years earlier, and the "Expanded Collection of Bright Expositions" says three years earlier. The envoys sent are listed in the "Collection of Records of the Three Pitakas," volume 42. The preface to the Sutra of Forty-two Chapters says it was Zhang Qian and twelve others, the "Three Records of Past Dynasties" says it was Qin Jing and fourteen others, and the "Comprehensive Record" says it was Cai Yin and eighteen others. The destination is said to be either India or Yuezhi, and what they brought back is said to be either Buddha images or Buddhist scriptures. Wang Yan's "Records of Hidden Omens" first stated that Kashyapa Matanga came east, and the "Biographies of Eminent Monks" added Dharmaraksha, making it two monks who arrived in Luoyang together. Wei Shou's "Treatise on Buddhism and Taoism" also states: "In the first year of the Yuanshou era of Emperor Ai, the king of Yuezhi sent Yicun to orally transmit the Sutra of the Buddha to Qin Jingxian." The "Records of the Western Regions" of the Wei Lue makes it Jing Lu. Zong Bing's "Discussion on Clarifying Buddhism" and the annotation in the "Literary Matters" chapter of the "New Account of Tales of the World" quoting Liu Xiang's "Biographies of Immortals" "Seventy-four people in the Buddhist scriptures" place it during the reign of Emperor Cheng. The "Book Evidence" chapter of the "Yan Family Instructions" states, "The praise saying 'Seventy-four people came from the Buddhist scriptures' was added by later generations and is not part of the original text." The "Treatise on Buddhism and Taoism" also states, "Zhang Qian was sent to Bactria and first heard of the teachings of the Buddha." It also says, "During the Yuanshou era of Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty, a golden statue of the Xiongnu king was obtained, and incense was burned and worship was offered." Wang Jian's "Stories of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty" says the same. Zong Bing further states, "Dongfang Shuo spoke of cosmic kalpas, indicating he knew of Buddhism," placing it during the reign of Emperor Wu. However, Fan Ye's "Records of the Western Regions" comments, "Buddhism and Taoism are divinely transformed, originating in India, but neither the local records of the two Han dynasties mention them." Going further back, it is said that during the reign of Emperor Qin Shi Huang, foreign monks named Shilifang and others came to convert with Buddhist scriptures, as seen in the catalogs of scriptures by Shi Daoan and Zhu Shixing. Even earlier, during the Warring States period, in the seventh year of King Zhao of Yan, a Taoist named Shilu carried a staff and held a cake, able to produce a ten-story pagoda from his fingertip, as seen in Wang Jia's "Forgotten Records." Even earlier, during the Spring and Autumn period, the "Expanded Collection of Bright Expositions" quotes Liezi, "Confucius heard that there was an 'opposite' in the West?" However, Zong Bing's "Reply to He Chengtian's Letter" states, "Zhou and Confucius never spoke of the Buddha," and Mouzi's "Treatise on Resolving Doubts" states, "Yao, Shun, Zhou, and Confucius did not know of Buddhism." Why is this? The "Continuation of the Biographies of Eminent Monks" quotes the "Book of Zhou, Strange Records" mentioning "Su You, the Grand Historian of King Zhao, and Hu Duo, the Grand Historian of King Mu," placing it in the Western Zhou. The "Discussion on Clarifying Buddhism" states, "Boyi described going to the sea, to the country of India, Guo Pu annotated that this is where the Buddha arose, also like the Great Compassionate teachings of the Tathagata," indicating that during the era of the Great Yu, Buddhism already existed. According to calculations, this was more than 1,620 years before the birth of Shakyamuni.</p>

<h3>Comedian Lu Qiqi Attempts Suicide by Jumping from Building, Rescued and Slightly Injured, Caused by Nervous Breakdown from Quitting Opium</h3>
<p>Lu Qiqi, a comedian from Suzhou, has long been addicted to opium, requiring a large monthly expenditure. Recently, due to the exorbitant price of opium and the decline in business, he found himself in dire straits. Recently, Lu's friends pooled a large sum of money and sent Lu to the Yongchuan Hospital on Route Macao Paulu in the French Concession to quit opium. He has been there for several days, and his progress has been good. However, yesterday morning around ten o'clock, Lu suddenly had a suicidal thought. Taking advantage of the nurses' inattention, he jumped from the window of his hospital room on the third floor. Fortunately, he was immediately discovered and rescued. He was only slightly injured and is currently still receiving treatment at the hospital. It is said that Lu's suicide was entirely caused by a nervous breakdown during the withdrawal period. It is said that abnormal behaviors caused by excessive nervous excitement are often heard during the withdrawal period, regardless of gender. In such cases, medical professionals must pay close attention.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Returns Home Late at Night, Reprimanded and Dies from Poisoning</h3>
<p>Zhang Xinshi, a 20-year-old woman from Chuansha, residing at No. 18, Fengyu Lane, No. 142, Sapa Race Road, went out to watch a movie on the afternoon of the 19th. She returned home at around 1:30 AM and was scolded by her aunt for a young woman not being out alone. After an argument, the woman became suicidal and swallowed cockroach powder that night. When the poison took effect, she was discovered and sent to Nanyang Hospital. Due to unsuccessful treatment, she died at noon the next day. The hospital reported to the police, who rushed to investigate and sent the body to the morgue.</p>
<h3>Seventeen Cases of Cholera Confirmed in Shanghai, Humid Weather Requires Vigilance</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Observatory, the humidity in Shanghai has suddenly increased in recent days. The humidity was 86-100% on the 18th and 96-99% on the 19th. This situation has a significant impact on the health of residents. Therefore, despite the cool weather, cases of cholera continue to be discovered. It is reported that a woman named Zhu Meili, residing in Chungui Lane, Xinza Road, was diagnosed with cholera at the Epidemic Hospital on the 18th. According to statistics, there have been seventeen cases of cholera in Shanghai, of which two have died. It is also known that the first two cases came from Shaozhi and Ningbo, which are known sources of cholera.</p>
<h3>Snow's "Chinese Experiences" to be Sold in Shanghai, Special Pre-Order Price</h3>
<p>Mr. Snow is a first-class American journalist. His previous book, "Red Star Over China," has long been welcomed by a wide range of readers. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Mr. Snow has traveled from Beijing to Shanghai, then to Hankou, Chengdu, and Yan'an. Based on his travels, he has reported on various important issues in China in a relaxed and lively style, using the literary form of reporting. These were compiled into a magnum opus entitled "Battle for Asia," which includes descriptions of important figures, analysis of party relationships, valuable secrets, and brilliant commentary, with a scope even broader than "Red Star Over China." The Starlight Editorial Office has selected and translated the most important parts related to China and renamed it "Snow's Chinese Experiences." It is being printed in Hong Kong and will soon arrive in Shanghai. The company has also made special arrangements with bookstores in Shanghai to handle pre-orders. The pre-order price is 2.60 yuan per copy and ends at the end of July. It is said that the number of books shipped to Shanghai is limited, so those who love to read Snow's works are rushing to pre-order.</p>

<p>Yu Zengyong Donates Children's Books: Mr. Yu Zengyong of the Shanghai Children's Education Circle, recognizing the scarcity and high prices of children's books on the isolated island, making it impossible for many to purchase them, has generously donated his collection of children's books and newspapers to various sectors. This is a great benefit to children during their spare time. Those who wish to receive the books should send a one-cent stamped return envelope to Mr. Yu at Dayuan Silk Store, Tianlun Building, Qingyang Lane, Nanjing Road. He will send the books accordingly. However, it is said that there are not many books and newspapers left, and the deadline is within three days. It is hoped that all young friends will seize the opportunity, but please do not ask in person.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast for 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the weather in Shandong, this area, and the coastal areas south of Ma'an Island will be sunny, turning cloudy at times, with easterly winds changing from gentle to strong. There is a cyclone south of the Ogasawara Islands, with bad weather, due to the hurricane moving northwest. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in Shanghai was 85.6 degrees and the lowest was 70.7 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 94.3 degrees and the lowest was 79.0 degrees.</p>
<h3>To the Interior via Guangzhouwan: Routes and Travel Expenses</h3>
<p>— Shounan</p>
<p>Currently, there are only two relatively safe routes to the interior: one is via Guangzhouwan to Guangxi, and the other is via Rangoon and then the Burma Road to Yunnan. Traveling via Rangoon is more troublesome; not only does it take months to obtain a passport, but baggage checks there are also very strict. Therefore, traveling via Guangzhouwan is preferable.</p>
<p>Here is a report from several friends who have arrived in the interior. It details the travel expenses, routes, and schedules, and also clearly states the things to pay attention to along the way. The travel expenses are, of course, calculated using the most economical method. I think many readers want to go to the interior, so you can refer to this.</p>
<p>(1) Shanghai to Hong Kong: Taking a Taikoo or Jardine Matheson ship takes about three days and nights to reach Hong Kong. The cheapest ticket is 50 yuan in national currency, plus 10 yuan for tips (meals are provided on board). Upon arrival in Hong Kong, hand over your luggage to the China Travel Service (CTS) to be delivered to your hotel for 1.10 Hong Kong dollars per piece (this avoids inspection troubles). Assuming two pieces of luggage, and a five-day wait in Hong Kong for a ship, you can stay at the Datong Hotel (next to the Wing On Department Store on Des Voeux Road), with a minimum cost of 4 Hong Kong dollars per day for food and lodging.</p>
<p>(2) Hong Kong to Guangzhouwan: There is a Great Precious Stone ship plying this route. Hand over two pieces of luggage to CTS to be sent on board, costing 1.10 Hong Kong dollars per piece. Purchase a ship ticket from CTS, approximately 18 Hong Kong dollars—3rd class. It takes one day and night to reach the destination, with food and lodging provided on board.</p>
<p>(3) Guangzhouwan to Chikan: A car ride of about half an hour. It is necessary to hire a car together with several people, costing about 20 yuan in national currency per person including luggage (the following are all in national currency).</p>
<p>(4) Chikan to Yulin: A six-day journey by sedan chair, costing 250 yuan per person (one person per chair, luggage cannot be carried along, even small bags are not allowed by the porters). Luggage costs 0.80 yuan per catty, assuming 140 catties, the total is 112 yuan. Food and lodging for six days costs 60 yuan. The most important thing to note is that it is best to form a group, with the luggage chairs in front and the passenger chairs behind, so as to supervise them. It is also necessary to take turns paying attention at each lodging station, especially at the Shijiao lodging station, as the police force there is weaker and porters often steal luggage. The route is as follows: first day, Chikan to Zhuxi; second day, Zhuxi to Lianjiang; third day, Lianjiang to Shijiao; fourth day, Shijiao to Liangtian; fifth day, Liangtian to Luchuan; sixth day, Luchuan to Yulin.</p>
<p>(5) Yulin to Guixian: Hiring a car together with several people is the simplest and most cost-effective method, taking one day and costing about 80 yuan per person including luggage. If there is no car, you can take a three-wheeled pedicab, which takes two days and costs 30 yuan per vehicle. However, there are high slopes along the way, requiring you to get off and walk for one or two kilometers. Taking a sedan chair takes about three days and costs about 100 yuan.</p>
<p>(6) Guixian to Guiping: Take a small steamboat-towed barge, with a ticket price of 3.20 yuan plus 0.50 yuan for tips. At this time, you must have identification, otherwise purchasing tickets and inspections along the way will be troublesome, and there will be many obstacles.</p>
<p>(7) Guiping to Shilong: Take a small steamboat-towed barge, which takes two days to reach the destination, with a ticket price of 4.50 yuan plus 0.50 yuan for tips. The conditions on the boat are very poor. The West River is rapid and has many reefs. To avoid moving luggage, most people spend the night on the boat. There are no cabins on the barge. Food expenses from Guixian to Shilong are about 18 yuan.</p>
<p>(8) Shilong to Liuzhou: Take a bus from the Highway Bureau, with a ticket price of 20 yuan. However, passenger tickets are not easy to obtain and often require waiting for four or five days. Luggage under 20 kilograms is free of charge, and for each 10 kilograms exceeding this weight, the fee is 8 yuan. Assuming a five-day wait in Shilong for a bus, the cost of food and lodging is about 40 yuan.</p>
<p>(9) Liuzhou to Yishan: Take the Qian-Gui Railway, with a second-class ticket price of 6 yuan, which takes four hours. The cost of staying overnight in Yishan that day is about 6 yuan.</p>
<p>(10) Yishan to Guiyang: Take a highway bus for around 140 yuan, which takes three days to reach the destination. Luggage exceeding 20 kilograms requires a freight fee of about 40 yuan. If there is a freight truck available, it is cheaper. Food and lodging for three days costs 30 yuan.</p>
<p>(11) Guiyang to Kunming: Highway bus costs 127.50 yuan. The cost of exceeding the luggage allowance is about 60 yuan. However, the Highway Bureau's bus cannot transport luggage to Kunming at the same time, so it is best to find a ride on a truck. The journey takes three days. Those going to Chongqing can take a highway bus from Guiyang to Chongqing, which takes two and a half days, with a ticket price of 117.12 yuan.</p>
<p>Notes: (1) The entire journey takes at least 35 days and up to one and a half months. (2) Two pieces of luggage are the most convenient, weighing about 140 catties in total. (3) The total travel expenses are 1385.07 yuan in national currency, calculated using the most economical method. If you stay for an extra day along the way, it will cost an additional 10 yuan. Therefore, you need to bring 55 Hong Kong dollars and 1250 yuan in national currency for the entire journey. (4) Identification is needed for inspections along the way and must be issued by a bank. It is best to have proof from an agency in the interior, which is more convenient. (5) The currency commonly used in Guangxi is called Guizi, and one Guizi is equivalent to 0.50 yuan in legal currency. (6) It is best to travel with several people, not only for mutual care, but also because travel expenses can be shared, so one person should not start out rashly.</p>
<h3>Zhang Yuanji's Oil Painting Solo Exhibition Opens Today</h3>
<p>The solo exhibition of oil paintings by the young painter Zhang Yuanji will open today (21st) at the Dasing Art Gallery. There are over 80 exhibits, all of which are oil paintings. The scenery of Guilin and Kunming is the most captivating. Mr. Zhang once painted a terraced field along the Southwest Highway, which shows the beautiful rivers and mountains of Free China. There are also individual works of human figures, still lifes, portraits, and compositions. The attached picture is one of Mr. Zhang's masterpieces, a large painting entitled "Exile," with somber colors, skillful brushstrokes, and excellent expressive power. Although the Dasing Art Gallery has continuous exhibitions, pure Western paintings are rare. This time, Mr. Zhang is holding a pure oil painting exhibition, which should attract Western art lovers.

<h3>Executive Yuan Issues Measures for Child Care, Each County to Have at Least One Child Care Center</h3>
<p>(Chongqing News) Children are the future masters of the country. The sound development of children's bodies and minds will ensure healthy citizens in the future. Since the war, due to the difficult living conditions of the people, parents' ability to raise their children has been affected, resulting in malnutrition and wandering children everywhere. There have also been cases of infanticide and selling children. Although the government has paid attention to promoting the establishment of child care centers and nurseries to provide some relief, it is not enough to solve this serious problem. The Executive Yuan has now distributed the "Measures to Solve the Problem of Child Care," as suggested by the actors graduating from the Mongolian Political Training Class, to the national health administration agencies for compliance. The measures are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Each county should have at least one child care center, and more should be established in areas with larger populations. Their facilities should be well-equipped to ensure that children who have no parents or who have parents who are unable to raise them, or who are unable to take care of them in reality, can be fostered. (2) For families with more than three unmarried children and who are truly in financial difficulty, a certain amount of living allowance should be given for each additional child. (3) Primary and secondary schools and kindergartens should establish and enrich facilities related to the physical and mental well-being of students in accordance with a certain proportion, depending on the population and area of the locality. (4) Local health administrative agencies should send personnel to each family in their area in the near future to guide women on how to raise children, and to examine children's physical condition and indicate ways to correct their shortcomings.</p>

<p>Scholarship Lectures</p>
<h3>Research Methods in History (7)</h3>
<p>— Xue Wujing</p>
<p>A. Thought: In Chinese history, the achievements of Chinese thought are expressed in three major currents. The first is the academic thought of the late Zhou period, an era of independence where politics and education were separate, and freedom of speech was extremely high. Many scholars, with compassionate hearts, spoke out to correct disorder and save the world. Although their ideas were diverse and their choices varied, they were like celestial horses soaring through the sky, unconstrained. Laozi and Zhuangzi emphasized naturalness and opposed ritualism. Confucius and Mencius valued benevolence, righteousness, and promoted ritual and music. Mozi advocated universal love and conformity. Han Fei promoted strict laws and severe punishments. Xu Xing advocated communal farming, Zou Yan discussed cosmology, and Gongsun Long explored the similarities and differences between "hard and white" and the "white horse is not a horse" argument. All of these had their own logic and reasons. No wonder people called this the Golden Age. The second current spans from the Han to the Song and Ming dynasties, a period of mixed Confucian, Buddhist, and Daoist thought. After Buddhism was introduced to China, some people translated texts, while others traveled to India. Coupled with the people's aversion to chaos since the Northern and Southern Dynasties, various sects flourished. By the Song and Ming dynasties, the teachings of Zen Buddhism particularly suited the tastes of the literati. Neo-Confucian scholars were Confucian rather than Buddhist, rejecting Buddhism openly but embracing it secretly. We only need to look at the "Song Yuan Academic Cases" and "Ming Confucian Academic Cases," Zhou Dunyi's "Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate," the Cheng brothers' emphasis on reverence and the investigation of things, Zhang Zai's "Western Inscription" and "Correcting Ignorance," Zhu Xi's investigation of things to extend knowledge, Lu Xiangshan's emphasis on the unity of mind and principle, and Wang Yangming's unity of knowledge and action. This was a period of integration of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism. The third current extends from the late Ming dynasty to the Republic of China, a period of clashing Eastern and Western thoughts. Since the European Renaissance, there has been a shift from monarchical power to democracy, from spirituality to materialism, from superstition to science, from the individual to society, from heaven to earth, and from the future to the present. Consequently, thought has been liberated, and human rights have been greatly expanded. The influence of Europe and America has spread to China, shaking the social structure and fundamentally changing people's minds. However, they only recognize the material, not the spiritual; they only recognize rights, not justice; they only recognize evolution, not mutual aid; they only recognize war, not peace; they only recognize movement, not stillness. The East and West each have their own strengths and weaknesses. In the future, these two currents of thought will move from conflict to harmony, and a new era of civilization will surely emerge. These are all things that those who study history cannot ignore or neglect.</p>
<p>B. Economy: Since Marx's economic interpretation of history was published, humanity's eyes and ears have been refreshed. His main idea is that social change is history. In other words, looking at humanity horizontally yields society, and looking at it vertically yields history. The foundation of society is its economic structure, which he calls the material. The upper layer of society consists of law, politics, religion, ethics, philosophy, art, etc., which he calls ideological forms. When the foundation changes, the upper layer also changes accordingly. He overturned the previous historians' tendency to explain social change solely from the upper layer of society, neglecting the foundation. With this theory, history became a living and progressive discipline. Thus, the evolutionary view of history corrected the heroic view of history, the economic view of history corrected the political view of history, and the scientific view of history corrected the theological view of history, which determined the value of history in the realm of science. Based on this theory, when we observe the past history of our country, various ethnic wars in history are nothing more than attempts to seize natural resources to satisfy the desire for survival. For example, the disturbances of Huang Chao, the rebellions of Zhang Xianzhong and Li Zicheng, and the uprisings of Hong Xiuquan and Yang Xiuqing all fall into this category. Guan Zhong said, "When the granaries are full, people will know etiquette." Mencius said, "Only those with constant property have constant minds." Confucius said, "Do not worry about scarcity, but worry about inequality." Furthermore, Sun Yat-sen's equal land ownership and regulation of capital are all aimed at solving economic problems. This is the fundamental concept of modern historical research.</p>

<h3>Improvement of China's Wartime Financial and Economic Policies (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Xia Yande</p>
<p>Food Policy</p>
<p>In wartime economic policy, sufficient food and sufficient troops are equally important. The adequacy of food is indeed of great importance in supporting the war effort and stabilizing people's livelihoods. During the last European war, Britain and Germany fought each other. They paid attention to using submarine policies to blockade each other's food supply, cutting off the enemy's lifeline. Germany later failed because of the lack of food, which led to the disintegration of morale and the shaking of popular sentiment. In this second war between Britain and Germany, Germany's attack on Britain still focused on intercepting the transport of food and other materials at sea. After the outbreak of the war, the food problem in Europe became extremely serious. In addition to doing their best to maintain supplies, the belligerent countries have long implemented controls internally; such as Germany's rationing of food based on population, Britain's restrictions on consumption, and other countries have also adopted effective measures.</p>
<p>China's food supply can generally be self-sufficient in peacetime. In the three years after the war, the provinces had successive bumper harvests, and there was no food problem. The principle of free market trading was still maintained, and no strict controls were imposed. Although the government promulgated the "Wartime Food Management Regulations" in August of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), making preliminary controls, it did not have a significant effect. As a result, in the fourth year of the war, rice prices soared in various places, and all things became expensive, and the livelihoods of ordinary people were panicked, forming a serious social problem.</p>
<p>The reason for this soaring rice price is not due to the sudden increase in the issuance of legal tender, nor is it due to the lack of supply. According to the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute’s report: The production of rice last year was similar to that of the previous year. Although some provinces decreased slightly, some provinces increased, and the total number was not much different. Even if there is a slight shortage, the past stocks are sufficient to cope with the surplus. The recent rise in rice prices is not the result of natural shortages, but is caused by artificial inflation. A small number of dignitaries and wealthy businessmen hoard and hoard goods, and landlords and wealthy farmers wait for high prices to sell. The inventory cannot be turned into supply for a while, and middle- and upper-class families worry that the price of rice will continue to rise and the supply of rice will be insufficient, so they rush to buy and stockpile it. The market demand exceeds the consumption needs, and supply and demand go in opposite directions, and finally lead to today’s rice prices. peak. This kind of unreasonable surge is caused by manpower, and it should be suppressed by political power.</p>
<p>Over the past year, the government has repeatedly changed its food policy in view of this situation. In principle, it was decided to implement management to maintain food for the people and to replenish military rations. In the Executive Yuan, a National Food Administration was specially set up. It has now expanded its scope and changed to the Ministry of Food. Below it, the province has a Food Administration, and the county and city have a Food Management Committee, which is responsible for management at all levels. Hoarding and hoarding will be severely cracked down. If officials are found to be hoarding, they will be sentenced to death in order to achieve the effect of punishing one to warn a hundred. The price of food is determined by the price evaluation committee of each province. Imports of rice are encouraged, while exports are prohibited. Now that the field tax has been changed to the collection of real objects, it can also accumulate noodles and food to stabilize rice prices. In addition, grain coupons are issued to purchase food, and public sales are also being implemented in the initial stage. Some provinces have also implemented special measures: such as Hunan’s grain donation, Fujian’s public sale, Chongqing’s grain storage registration in Sichuan, and Jinhua’s rationing of food in Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Some government officials advocate that the government should not only manage food, but also further implement state-owned food, and that all food in the country, except for the part necessary for farmers, should be publicly bought and sold by the state. This proposal is naturally a thorough and revolutionary policy, which can immediately solve the problem of unequal distribution; however, the biggest abuse can easily reduce production. In the past, the Soviet Union suffered famine as a result, and tens of thousands of people starved to death. Therefore, I believe that we should still adopt a steady approach: on the one hand, encourage food production, on the other hand, prohibit food waste, and use parity purchase and sale or price limit to prevent food production from decreasing and obtain fair prices and reasonable distribution.</p>
<p>Land Policy</p>
<p>The declaration of the Financial Conference stated that food policy and land policy are the two major policies of the Principle of People's Livelihood and should be implemented at the same time. The current food policy is only a palliative measure, and the fundamental solution must be to implement the land policy. Seeing its intention, it is believed that food is only a product of land production, and leveling the prices of land production is only to reduce land income. If the land system is further reformed, the land itself has been fairly distributed, and this kind of income will have no way to generate it at all. Mr. Zhongshan advocated equal land rights to equalize the distribution of social wealth and eliminate unearned profits; its implementation methods can be divided into several points: (1) taxation according to price, (2) purchase according to price, (3) price increase for public ownership, (4) farmers have their land, and the last point is especially emphasized. Later, the land law formulated by the National Government has more detailed regulations on the implementation of various aspects. Now the authorities have stated that they want to promote the policy of equal land rights, but they have not put forward any new methods. It is probably prepared to implement it in accordance with the current guidelines of the Principle of People's Livelihood and the Land Law.</p>
<p>Some government officials said that equal land rights is the policy of state-owned land, and land should be gradually nationalized, and the state should become a major landlord; and advocated learning from the Soviet Union's example and achieving this goal in a revolutionary way. However, I don't think so. Mr. Zhongshan's policy does not want to nationalize the land. Except for the land that can be bought and publicly owned for public needs, most of it is still owned by the people. His method can be said to be a land-farmer-owned policy. Although public land ownership is the ultimate ideal, the current implementation only needs to popularize the land, that is, to implement the policy that farmers have their own land. Since the state does not want to be a major landlord, the method of uncompensated confiscation does not need to be adopted.</p>
<p>Recently, the Farmers Bank of China has been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to set up a land finance department with a capital of 50 million yuan to provide long-term agricultural credit loans and is allowed to issue land bonds. It is known that the loans are divided into the following types: (1) Land purchase loan based on price, (2) Land micro-use loan, (3) Land improvement loan, (4) Land replanning loan, (5) Self-cultivation farmer assistance loan, (6) Land registration consolidation loan. Among them, items 4 and 6 help the government to consolidate land, items 1 and 2 help the government to purchase land, and items 5 and 3 help farmers to purchase and benefit from land use. The overall intention should be to use the issued land bonds to lend to poor farmers and tenants to purchase cultivated land from landlords in order to achieve the goal of farmers owning their own land. However, this work is very difficult and cannot be undertaken by the meager resources of the Farmers Bank alone. Moreover, if the landlords are unwilling to sell their land, how will the government deal with it? This is a major reform in internal affairs. In today's extremely serious foreign troubles, I am afraid it is not an appropriate time to implement it.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Looking at the resolutions of the Fifth National Congress of the Eighth Central Committee and the Three Financial Conferences: the fiscal policy is to balance national income and expenditure and equalize the burden of the people; the food policy is to suppress hoarding and speculation and maintain military rations and people's food; the land policy is to realize equal land rights and enable farmers to have their own land. Among them, the land policy only expresses a point of intention, the food policy is also mostly in principle, and several more concrete methods have been put forward for the fiscal policy. In addition to eliminating long-standing malpractices in a negative way, it also builds a sound financial system in a positive way; compared with the abolition of Likin and tariff autonomy set by the First Financial Conference, and the reform of land tax and the abolition of corvee set by the Second Financial Conference, the scope is wider and the significance is more significant. In particular, the equalization of the national burden is something we are happy to hear.</p>
<p>In the past, the wartime finances handled by the government have done a great job in raising war funds; the supply has been constant for several years and has not hindered the progress of the war. However, the war expenses are not very fair to bear, and this point has been frankly admitted by the highest military authorities. Although the government did not issue much additional currency in the first two years of the war, it did not come up with effective ways to absorb it into production and construction, which led to rising prices. Rising prices, on the one hand, increased the need and supply of currency, and on the other hand, enabled floating capital to have the opportunity to speculate and profit in the market. The higher the price, the more legal tender is issued, the thicker the speculative profit, and the price continues to rise as a result. Such repeated cycles make the rich become extremely rich, the poor become extremely poor, and the middle class also fall into poverty. Today, labor income is really too low; look at how many civil servants, intellectuals and civilians have made great contributions to the country during the war, but their lives are extremely difficult. On the other hand, property income is too high, and a small number of wealthy speculators have gained benefits that they never dreamed of in peacetime. Such a phenomenon cannot be seen in European and Western belligerent countries. For example, Germany immediately raised 40% of private capital when the war broke out, and the maximum operating profit could not exceed 5%, so there was no possibility of making huge profits at all. After the war, Britain also levied taxes on national foreign exchange holdings, and the wartime profit tax rate was raised to 100% at most. The government is now re-emphasizing the use of tax policies to raise war funds, and the above-mentioned phenomena must be corrected so that the war expenses are borne by those with greater ability.</p>
<p>Today, China is at a critical juncture. In addition to doing everything possible to save the country's survival, we must also consider the long-term plan for future construction. War can change a country's economy: it can lead the country to the road of capitalism, or it can gradually lead to the road of people's livelihood or socialism. Our current financial and economic policies must not only adapt to the huge needs of wartime, but also conform to the principles of national economy and social justice. The government should exercise its power to make the rich pay and maintain the necessary lives of the common people. In a long-term war, the nation and the people's livelihood must be considered together. The important measures of this conference are not much different from these principles. The actual effectiveness depends on how it is implemented in the future. Now the people should abide by the principle of "those who have money pay, and those who have strength contribute", and the officials must also adhere to the spirit of "civil officials do not want money, and military officials are not afraid of death", so that the future of the country will be promising.</p>
<h3>On National Defense and Agricultural-Industrial Construction</h3>
<p>— Chen Hezhang</p>
<p>I. The Importance of National Defense Construction</p>
<p>Experience tells us that war is an indelible part of human nature. Looking at the wars recorded in history, there have been countless instances. Analyzing these wars, it can be said that war is an indispensable element for national survival. "The superior wins and the inferior is deceived; the strong eat the weak" is the principle of natural selection. The so-called "survival of the fittest" applies not only to the natural world but also to human society; it applies not only to individuals but also to nations. (Note 1) The superiority or inferiority of national competition depends entirely on the strength or weakness of national power. This national defense refers not only to the strength of military equipment but also to the power of thought, and especially to the great power of economics, in short, national defense economic power.</p>
<p>After the Northern Expedition, the Chinese Nationalist Party formulated the "Outline for Resistance and Reconstruction," among which the first economic outline stated: "Economic construction should be centered on military affairs, while also paying attention to improving people's lives." The phrase "centered on military affairs" essentially means "centered on national defense." The purpose of national defense economic construction is not merely to expand military equipment unilaterally. It should be known that the other wing of national defense is an economic power that cannot be ignored. There are many forms of warfare, and the most severe and vicious of these is economic warfare. (Note 2) In order to accomplish this mission of resistance and reconstruction, China has long decided to establish a self-sufficient and self-reliant national defense economy.</p>
<p>How is national defense economic power cultivated? Examining emerging countries, they all prioritize the cultivation of heavy industry and industries that meet industrial needs. From Peter the Great in Russia to the Five-Year Plans of the Soviet Union and the Four-Year Plan of Germany, all have focused on national defense considerations to cultivate national defense economic power. What about China? Heavy industry? Heavy agriculture? Or a balance of agriculture and industry? This is the theme that this article will discuss.</p>
<p>II. The Characteristics and Great Achievements of Agricultural-Industrial Construction</p>
<p>Whether China should be an agricultural country or an industrial country is a problem that must be solved in the process of resistance and reconstruction. Based on China's basic needs and the past experiences of other countries, most experts believe that national economic construction can only be promoted through industrialization. However, more than 75% of China's population is engaged in agriculture, agricultural income accounts for 80% of the national income, and agricultural exports account for about 70% of the total export value. The importance of agriculture in China's economy is evident. From this perspective, how can we abandon agriculture and replace it with industry? Therefore, what China needs is to use industry to promote agriculture, and to establish industry through agriculture, just like the United States and the Soviet Union, in the process of highly industrialized development, agricultural production is not neglected. In other words, China needs to "emphasize industry" without "abandoning agriculture"; but it does not advocate the equal development of industry and agriculture, but only strives for its balanced development. The so-called balanced development means that in the process of industrial development, attention is paid to the development and utilization of agricultural resources, and the goals of agricultural improvement and promotion still take into account how to promote industrial production. Generally speaking, it is agricultural industrialization. As for why China needs agricultural industrialization, the length of this article does not allow it. However, in general, agricultural industrialization, from the standpoint of the rural economy, is to develop various inherent handicrafts in rural areas, and to increase the income of agricultural management through the improvement of tools, technology, and organizational methods. Its production method may be the processing of self-produced raw materials, or the processing of purchased raw materials or semi-finished products. From the standpoint of the industrial economy, agricultural industrialization is also the only way for new-style industries to decentralize to agriculture, using industrial capital to shift to the surplus labor and low labor costs and raw materials in rural areas, in order to reduce production costs. (Note 3) Therefore, it can be said that China needs to attach equal importance to agriculture and industry.</p>
<p>In terms of enterprise, after China went to war, national defense economic construction was determined to focus on both agriculture and industry. Regarding this point, Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao clearly stated in his article "Economic Construction Policy": "Today, the purpose of my country's economic construction is two-fold: (1) to build for national defense; (2) to build for people's livelihood. Therefore, we plan to adhere to two major policies: one is to promote both industry and mining, and the other is to attach equal importance to agriculture and industry. Its specific goals can be listed in four aspects: (1) to establish a national defense basic industry, promote the development of mining, the supply of electricity, and lay the foundation for general industry; (2) to promote agricultural improvement and the use of scientific methods, in order to increase production and improve farmers' livelihoods; (3) to use domestic raw materials, improve industrial, agricultural, and mining production technology, in order to reduce costs, expand sales, and gradually achieve self-sufficiency in food, fuel, and other necessities; (4) to improve the organization of the rural economy and industrial and commercial groups, so that they can help each other and use them flexibly." From this passage, it is not difficult to see that China's national defense economic construction policy has indeed paid attention to all aspects of agriculture and industry. It should be noted here that the agriculture and industry referred to in this article are agriculture and industry in a broad sense. The former includes forestry, and the latter includes mining. From this, it can be inferred that China's national defense economic power actually includes agriculture, forestry, industry, and mining. Therefore, the cultivation of China's national defense economic power lies in rational construction of agriculture and industry based on actual needs. The so-called rationalization of construction refers to the balanced development of agriculture and industry, without overemphasizing either; all construction should meet the requirements of national defense, because construction without national defense is no different from no construction.</p>
<p>Since the war, four years have passed. If we review the agricultural-industrial construction, we are glad that we have been proceeding along a rationalized path, and its great achievements are indeed worth mentioning. The progress can be seen from what Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao said: "Before the war, my country had very few national defense heavy industries. Although the government tried its best to plan and prepare, most of them had not yet started production. Today, my country's national defense heavy industries, steel, machinery, electrical appliances, chemicals, and mining departments, both state-owned and private, are advancing simultaneously, and all have products. Although there is still a considerable distance from self-sufficiency; but it has built a broad foundation for national defense industrial self-reliance. Before the war, my country's rural areas were extremely dilapidated, especially in the southwestern and northwestern provinces. Today, in my southwestern and northwestern provinces, due to the financing of agricultural finance, the construction of farmland water conservancy, the promotion of agricultural cooperation, the improvement of agricultural technology, and the export of cash crops, there has indeed been great progress."</p>
<p>The purpose of agricultural industrialization is to promote the national people's self-sufficiency in food and clothing, and also to promote the large-scale export of agricultural products. China's food was originally self-sufficient. Since the war, there have been bumper harvests year after year, and there should be no difficulty in food supply and demand; however, due to traffic obstacles and inconvenient transportation, private hoarding has gradually increased, stimulating rising food prices, which is undeniable. The authorities are taking effective control measures in this regard, and this local phenomenon should not be difficult to solve. As for the matter of self-sufficiency in clothing, as far as the whole country is concerned, the supply of cotton clothing is no longer a problem. The national cotton production reached more than 12 million dans in the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), and cotton used to be an import surplus, but in the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), it had become an export surplus. Unfortunately, the expansion of the war zone has inevitably been greatly affected. Therefore, the government has increased the planting of high-quality cotton in Sichuan, Yunnan, and other provinces, and has also worked hard to transport the surplus cotton from western Hubei and Shaanxi to the southwest. As of the end of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), there were 12 textile factories relocated inland. According to reports, by the end of June this year (1941), the newly added factories and textile factories could reach 400, so they are sufficient to supply the needs of a large number of troops and the majority of the people in the rear. As for other agricultural products such as tung oil, tea, and hog bristles, under the government's unified sales and encouragement, the export volume is very considerable, and it has made a great contribution to increasing the source of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>As for the industry itself, the total amount of industrial investment in Free China has reached 150,000 million yuan, and the total output value of various factories in the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940) was 340,000 million yuan, which is a sharp increase of one and a half times compared with the 140,000 million yuan in the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939); and 11 centers of light and heavy industries have also been formed in the southwest and northwest. The total number of new-style factories has reached 1,400, and even gasoline and alcohol, which had almost no output before the war, can now produce 400,000 to 500,000 gallons per month. Such achievements, even if exhausted by ten thousand words, cannot express one ten-thousandth of them.</p>
<p>III. Prospects for Agricultural-Industrial Construction</p>
<p>In summary, the operation of new-style industries is growing, and the work of agricultural innovation has begun to dawn. This has indeed established a broad foundation for national defense construction. In the future, in order to take a step further and complete the great cause of national construction, we must strive for the balanced development of agriculture and industry, and more importantly, adopt a perfect economic system.</p>
<p>China's economic system will undoubtedly adopt an economic system centered on the Principle of People's Livelihood as the construction center. Regarding this point, Mr. Wei Tingsheng made a thorough explanation in his article "Ten Policies for Economic Construction in the Southwest," which is quoted as follows: "My country's economic construction should be based on the Principle of People's Livelihood and achieve the goal of people's enjoyment. The Principle of People's Livelihood combines the strengths of both capitalism and communism, so that the benefits of social production are enjoyed by all the people, and its business is not manipulated by special elements, and its benefits are not monopolized by the capitalist class. On the one hand, the state directly operates production enterprises in a commercial manner, and on the other hand, the state guides small-scale private enterprises, forming a link in social production, that is, on the one hand, developing state capital, and on the other hand, controlling private capital, striving for increased production in production, and striving for rational distribution in distribution. The socialization of distribution under the Principle of People's Livelihood is to solve the problems of production and distribution at the same time in a gradual manner." (Note 4) In fact, the Chinese government's economic construction plan is to follow Sun Yat-sen's legacy that heavy industry and national defense industry should be state-owned in principle, and light industry should be government-encouraged and privately-operated in principle. Please observe that domestic transportation has long been nationalized, and larger mining areas, especially mining areas for national defense industry and heavy industry, have also been designated as state-owned mining areas. As for private enterprises, the government authorities are also making every effort to promote them, in order to cooperate and advance together. For example, the government has formulated laws and measures for the encouragement of private enterprises and government-business cooperation. As for agriculture, the recent Third National Financial Conference resolved to implement food policies and land policies, with the aim of solving military rations and people's food, and equalizing land rights, in order to realize the Principle of People's Livelihood. From the above, it can be seen that the government authorities have adopted an economic system of the Principle of People's Livelihood and are moving towards the road of rationalization. Looking forward to the future, we feel infinite excitement and gratification!</p>
<p>However, the smooth completion of national defense agricultural-industrial construction still depends on our greatest efforts. As mentioned earlier, war is an indelible part of human nature. Therefore, only when the survival of the entire nation is secured by "national defense" can the individuals in the collective have "enjoyment." Therefore, in the construction of the country today, we have to put "national defense" first and "enjoyment" second.</p>

<h3>Sugar Cane and Cane Sugar (4)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>Now, let's briefly describe the process of spreading this precious plant, sugarcane, to all parts of the world. By 1420 AD, Prince Henry, the famous Portuguese prince who encouraged the search for new sea routes, had already cultivated sugarcane in the newly discovered Canary Islands and Madeira Islands - all in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean off Africa. When Columbus made his second exploration of the New World in 1494 AD, he also spread sugarcane to Haiti in the West Indies; from there, it was first widely spread to Cuba, and then invaded Brazil in the early 16th century, entered Mexico around 1520, and then spread to various parts of the Americas. Especially Santo Domingo on the island of Haiti, sugarcane was introduced and soon by 1515, it was able to produce cane sugar in large quantities in an orderly manner. It has since maintained its top position, with the title of "Sugar Island": for example, in 1789, at the beginning of the French Revolution, it had 723 sugar factories with an annual sugar production of 100 million kilograms! However, two years later, it also experienced a violent revolution, and the entire island's sugar industry was completely destroyed, so it had to transfer its leading position to the neighboring island of Cuba. Now, Cuba produces 2.1 million tons of sugar annually. Although it ranks second to India in terms of quota, it can control the world's cane sugar market. In short, within less than 100 years after the introduction of sugarcane to the New World, the export of cane sugar has occupied the most important position in goods; and the quality is good, and the price is cheap, far better than the sugar made by Europeans; therefore, the sales are naturally increasingly broad, and like mercury spilling on the ground, it has penetrated into all areas of the world. As for the spread of sugarcane to Natal in South Africa and New South Wales in Australia, it was in 1852; and since the East Indian islands such as Java and Sumatra are only separated from India by a body of water, when was sugarcane introduced? We cannot answer this question, just as we cannot answer when Indians began to plant sugarcane. - In summary: After the discovery of the New World, how many precious and beneficial plants were given to the Old World; now we have the Old World's sugarcane - and of course coffee - as our "reciprocity," which is also considered to have fulfilled the human sentiment of "reciprocity."</p>

<h3>US Cotton Soars More Than Fifty Points</h3>
<p>The New York cotton market is active and strong, due to mass purchases, Washington political news is favorable to bulls, raising cotton cloth price limits, and poor weather reports, the rise is quite strong, and the closing result is a sharp rise of 51 to 56 points compared to the previous day's price.</p>
<p>Also, from August 1 last year to July 18 this year, US cotton statistics are recorded on the left (500 pounds per bale)</p>
<p>The Bombay cotton market initially fell due to sales by European exporters, but rebounded due to short covering. The closing result was an increase of one and a half to four and three-quarters of a rupee compared to the previous day's price.</p>
<p>Also, the forecast price for the opening today is expected to be eight rupees higher.</p>
<h3>Gardenia Slightly Falls</h3>
<p>Recently, no new shipments of small gardenia have arrived from the Jiangbang area. A small number of shipments have been handled in the frozen water area, and dozens of pieces have been shipped from Shantou, because the cost is more suitable, so the asking price has also loosened by 20 to 30 yuan, but the inventory is fundamentally weak, and the market is expected to stabilize.</p>
<h3>The Price of Beauty Cigarettes Also Rises</h3>
<p>The buying price of cigarettes is still rising, because the factory's shipments are very scarce, and the recent customer sales have become more prosperous, and the big merchants are still holding on and refusing to sell, and the current stock of chips on the market feels scarce, resulting in the price rising sharply. Yesterday, the price of Great Britain brand was 1,667 yuan per box, Old Knife brand was 1,195 yuan, and Pin Hai brand was 1,175 yuan, all 50 yuan higher than before, Wu Hua brand was 795 yuan, and Little Fairy brand was 830 yuan, also slightly higher. The market sales price of Beauty brand of Hua Cheng Company rose, and the new price for 10-pack is 1,500 yuan, and the 50-pack canned is 1,700 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Actual Sales of White Lead Sheet Are Difficult to Expand, the Standard Price is Still Firm</h3>
<p>The market condition of white lead sheet in this city has been difficult to see a boom since the relocation of the battery factory, and the acceptance of Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao gangs has also been closed. Although there are some buyers and sellers, the number is very small, resulting in a sluggish market and difficult actual sales. Currently, only printing factories, type rooms, and tea houses in this street are responding to the market, and there are not many transactions. However, the colleagues who hold the goods are quite firm in their thinking. The reason is that the supply of goods from overseas has long ceased, and the buying and selling in this port is only based on the old inventory. The inventory is getting thinner day by day, and people's hearts are rising. Therefore, the market price is high. Yesterday, such as No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4, because the elimination was very small, the standard was slightly lower, selling for 4,000 yuan per barrel. No. 8, No. 10, and No. 12 were very popular among printing factories, and the market was very high, selling for about 5,200 yuan.</p>

<p>Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation</p>
<h3>Save on Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation Expenses to Support the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund Movement!</h3>
<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>Living in this turbulent era, the cost of clothing, food, housing, and transportation accounts for a very important page in our economy. Even if prices soar, we cannot but live. In order to live, we have to be slaves to clothing, food, housing, and transportation. If we calculate the daily expenses of every middle-class family on the isolated island, it is really amazing; so that the parents are running around all day for this clothing, food, housing, and transportation, in order to seek a minimum standard of living. However, there are many wealthy classes on the isolated island, and the price increase of everything seems to have nothing to do with them. They still wear silk and satin, delicacies, new-style foreign houses, and modern cars. It is not surprising that they spend nearly 1,000 yuan a month on transportation alone, but on the poverty-stricken side, even a large cake cannot be solved, which is also common on the isolated island. It is the same person, one in heaven, one in hell, and there is a world of difference. Therefore, due to the large number of poor people, various charitable organizations have emerged, relying on the support of people from all walks of life, but these charitable organizations are mostly about material relief, and there are indeed many young people on the isolated island who are aspiring to study, but they have no material assistance, and are stunned by the schools that require money for everything; moreover, they are still afraid of their material food, and a wave of desire for knowledge hits their hearts, which seems to be more serious than material food. Even if they have the determination to seek knowledge, they have no monetary relief, which leads to dropping out of school, unemployment, and falling into ruin. However, people are sympathetic and will never turn a blind eye. Why not help them?</p>
<p>Young people are the lifeblood of the country and the masters of the future. I think every reader of this publication is already familiar with this. Why not give them a helping hand? It is easy to save some money in the daily expense items. Think about which of the four items of clothing, food, housing, and transportation cannot be saved a little? Even if it is only one or two points, for example, in the clothing item, if you want to cut cloth for one yuan a foot, you might as well cut about nine corners a foot. Although the price difference is one or two points, the difference in the quality of the cloth is not too big. It is the same to wear, and the money is saved. In the food item, if you want to buy small dishes for one yuan, you can save one corner of money and change to buying dishes for one yuan and nine corners. If you can save one corner a day, you can save one yuan in ten days. Moreover, eating one corner less of dishes will not cause any nutritional deficiencies. In the housing item, going to bed earlier every day can save some electricity costs, and you can save several yuan a month. On the one hand, you can develop a good habit of going to bed early and getting up early, which can promote physical health. In the transportation item, walking more and taking the bus less every day can save bus money. In short, saving one or two corners in daily expenses is really an effortless thing. However, the author is not promoting saving to the point where you don't even eat, but saving some unnecessary expenses within the possible range. On the one hand, you can develop thrifty habits, and on the other hand, you can cherish material resources; and what is even more commendable is to donate the money saved from clothing, food, housing, and transportation to hard-working young people and cultivate useful talents for the country! It is also to save some vitality for the nation; how great is this achievement! Therefore, please everyone promote saving daily expenses and respond to the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund Movement! That is not only the good fortune of hard-working young people! It is the good fortune of society! It is also the good fortune of the country! It is even more the good fortune of the nation! May everyone work hard!</p>
<h3>Clothes Talk</h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>The British government Monopoly Bureau has long issued a monopoly license for using bamboo as a raw material for clothing. It is used for the same purpose as hemp and cotton. The manufacturing method is to first soak the bamboo in a chemical solution for several days until the fibers are completely separated, then take it out and dry it, and it can be woven into clothing. The cost is very low, and bamboo grows very densely in tropical regions, so there is no shortage of raw materials.</p>
<p>Mrs. De Ye, a female scientist in Massachusetts, USA, has invented a type of clothing paper, called Sona in English. It is said that this paper is smooth and soft, like soft leather, does not get wet in water, does not get hot in fire, can be washed, can be ironed, and can be dyed in various colors, which will not change for a long time. The characteristic of this paper is that it not only has the same function as cloth, but also can be used more flexibly than cloth.</p>
<p>A certain part of the Mediterranean Sea produces a type of shellfish, whose shell is about three inches wide and about seven inches long. Each shell contains a very delicate bunch of silk, mixed with other marine plants, and submerged in mud. After washing and combing, it is golden and brilliant in color, no different from real silk. The silk maker must have experience, and after weaving, it can be used to make silk scarves, ties, gloves, scarves, and the like.</p>
<p>Los Angeles in the United States is a district where actresses gather, and the styles of clothing compete for novelty and are endless. Famous actresses often go to Paris to purchase new clothes, but since the principle of electric wire photography has been used, the new styles are transmitted from Paris to Los Angeles through submarine telegraphy. The weaving machines are already prepared, and as soon as the styles arrive, they start weaving in the same way. After 24 hours, they can appear on the market. From then on, women do not have to travel far across the ocean! (Note: This was the situation before the war).</p>
<p>According to the research results of many scientists appointed by the University of Agricultural Science in the province of Los Angeles, the degree of protection of various fabrics on the skin is that animal fibers can absorb more sunlight than plant fibers. Wearing hemp fabrics in the summer, the skin will be burned and turn black after one and a half hours. Cotton fabrics require two hours, wool fabrics require seven hours, and silk fabrics require ten hours. According to this, the protection of silk fabrics on the skin is better than all other fabrics.</p>
<p>There is a lace tree in Central America. The inner layer of its bark is colorful and orderly, even if it is a delicate weaver, it is not possible. About 300 years ago, on the birthday of the Spanish king, his subjects living in Mexico presented a collar made of lace tree, which was all natural except for cutting and polishing.</p>
<h3>Madam Fish in Henan</h3>
<p>— Wei Jingchun</p>
<p>Having read Mr. Chen Nianyun's article "Madam Fish" in a previous issue of this publication, its specialized leisure is indeed admirable, a delightful food tale. However, the location mentioned is erroneous, so I offer this supplementary account, not to find fault, but to correct it.</p>
<p>According to what I know, "Madam Fish," commonly known as "Gold and Silver Phoenix Fish," has long been famous in Bianliang. The name itself suggests that it is no ordinary dish, hence one of the most renowned local delicacies. Indeed, carp can be found everywhere, but none compare to the Yellow River carp of Kaifeng, which are remarkably large and incredibly delicious. The seasoning and cooking methods are as previously described, but after washing the fish, everything inside the belly must be removed. When frying in oil, the heat should be low. After boiling, the wine and vinegar should be added generously, which will further enhance the flavor. Eating it creates a feeling of wanting to continue indefinitely. Therefore, the people of Bianliang often use it to treat esteemed guests. If this dish is absent, it is considered disrespectful. As a result, restaurants all try to offer it as a rare item, and the price is particularly high. When I was working in that area in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), I once purchased a fish for three strings of 800 cash coins to cook and eat. I felt that its taste was distinctly different from ordinary carp, resembling the taste of snake, but even more delicious. As for the name "Madam Fish," it was actually invented by the wife of the former chairman of Henan Province, Liu Zhi. (According to Mr. Chen's article, it was Hunan, which is likely a mistake for Henan.) The Liu family had lived in Bian for many years, and Mr. Liu had great respect for his wife. One day, Mr. Liu hosted a banquet for guests at the provincial office, including Secretary-General Fang Qidao, Finance Director Qi Zhenru, Construction Director Zhang Ruoyu, and administrative supervisors from various districts, all gathered together in a cheerful atmosphere. However, although all kinds of delicacies were prepared for the feast, only this "Gold and Silver Phoenix Fish" was missing. Mrs. Liu immediately ordered the cook to purchase it at a high price and personally cooked it to serve the guests. As a result, the name "Madam Fish" spread far and wide.</p>
<h3>Today's Housing</h3>
<p>Zhu Ying</p>
<p>War indeed inflicts cruel suffering on humanity, but this suffering can stimulate long-numbed nations and remind them of the value of their existence. From this value, they learn to create civilization, where the glory of Caesar-style martial prowess is not a necessary form of happiness. The people of Shanghai, who were once fortunate, actually gained life experience for a time as the entire city became a war zone, a fiery hell. The sound of cannons roared, planes battled in the sky, and various colored meteors streaked across the night sky, which should have been enough to awaken them. However, there were still those who enjoyed the spectacle, widening their interested eyes to see where the fires were starting and where the buildings were collapsing, feeling both fear and pleasure!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our troops fought hard for three months and then left, causing those who rejoiced in others' misfortunes to initially feel sadness, followed by terror, then confusion, and finally, feigning ignorance, they returned to "business as usual." On one hand, they indulge in pleasure as much as possible, and on the other hand, they speculate as much as possible! They have forgotten yesterday's bayonets, and they drink beer to celebrate the arrival of good fortune tomorrow. Mobile funds are piled up in the hands of speculators, and they will never automatically flow inland again! Because they are full of food and thinking about action, the practice of "hoarding and speculating" has affected every aspect of life: food, clothing, housing, and transportation. Which one has not increased in price? And which one is not competing with time, proportionally increasing in a straight line upwards? Rice and coal are soaring in price, transportation fares are repeatedly increasing, and cotton and woolen goods have increased by another 100%. No wonder the housing problem is becoming increasingly turbulent today.</p>
<p>Originally, after the war, the population decreased, and many houses were sealed off by the streets. As the occupied areas expanded, more and more people came here for refuge, creating a feeling that there were fewer houses than people. Those who came to seek refuge were mostly wealthy or moderately wealthy from various places, so it was not surprising that they were willing to pay high prices to purchase real estate. Judging from the situation of bank real estate mortgages for building houses and renting them out, which has not declined since 1939, it can be confirmed without a doubt. On the other hand, those who control real estate, jealous of the lucrative business of food, clothing, and transportation, also want to take the opportunity to squeeze profits, so they first increase rents for poor tenants, then issue eviction orders. Now, a new organization has emerged—a group responsible for evicting tenants! Because the administrative authorities turn a blind eye, they indirectly fuel the flames of the evil-doers' instigation, so that an old three-story building requires a monthly rent of more than one hundred yuan, and a key money of eight thousand five hundred; an office, only a little more than one square zhang in size, with a telephone, is said to require six or seven thousand yuan in key money, heavens! Who is really doing this? Who is really doing this!</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Huo Xueming, who teaches at Mingde Girls' High School, has been looking for a small house recently, but has had no success after several days of searching. Even if he wants to ask for advice, no one can give him any help. Therefore, I have a strange idea: Shanghai has many large mansions, and their young masters and misses, often for safety reasons, do not go to school, but hire tutors, and their houses are both empty and large. If Mr. Huo could be invited to live in their homes and pay rent as usual, and he could teach for two or three hours a day, wouldn't it be easier to make progress with such close instruction? Moreover, his wife, Ms. Zhao, is at the forefront of new literature, and has a foundation in English and mathematics! This proposal is certainly one-sided and ridiculous, but there may be opponents who fit this condition. If agreeable, please contact Mingde Girls' High School. However, this fact can reflect the current situation in Shanghai, which really does not allow a poet to have a foothold! Instead, red-bearded and green-eyed heroes have become the main characters of this era, performing scenes of self-proclaimed clever clowns!</p>
<p>However, the real feeling of life's suffering has a great price. Although we say that we are enduring the pain suffered for justice in this great era?</p>

<h3>A Week's Worth of Everyday Menu</h3>
<p>— Hua Ying</p>
<p>Potatoes, commonly known as foreign yams, are also a good source of vitamins. Of course, they are indispensable in Western cuisine, where they often appear in three or four out of five or six dishes. Now, potatoes have also become quite expensive, so Western restaurants are saving where they can and not using them as liberally as before. In home cooking, potatoes are always used to accompany curry chicken, but recently, my family has been using them to make large meat patties. Because pork prices have soared, one yuan's worth of meat is not enough to make many meat patties. Peel and mash the potatoes, mix them with ground pork, and you can save half the pork. Make them into meat patties, and braise them together with a base of green vegetables, and the flavor is not bad. Besides this, you can also use them to make vegetarian meat patties. Just chop dried bean curd, shiitake mushrooms, etc. into small pieces, mix them with mashed potatoes, make them into patties, and braise them. The old ladies who eat vegetarian food will definitely welcome them.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<p>Just a Few Words</p>
<h3>How to Apply for Jiaotong University?</h3>
<p>— Han</p>
<p>Just a modest attempt to show the way, nothing like a brick to knock on the door.</p>
<p>After the war, primary and secondary schools in Shanghai sprang up like mushrooms after rain, but universities and specialized schools mostly closed their doors, planning mergers or temporary suspensions. The surviving ones are mostly focused on arts and commerce, with very few in science and engineering. Jiaotong University, long regarded as the highest institution of learning in the Southeast and possessing a long history, will undoubtedly be the most ideal school in the minds of thousands of middle school graduates who aspire to study science and engineering. On the eve of the entrance examination, I, as an alumnus, would like to offer a word to the thousands of candidates. I will mainly discuss the nature of the test questions for each subject.</p>
<p>Classical and Profound Chinese</p>
<p>In the past, Chinese essay questions were mostly based on the Four Books and Five Classics. The meaning of the questions was profound, and those who did not read the classics would often be unable to understand the meaning of the questions and could not start writing. In recent years, there has been much criticism from various parties, so this antiquarian examiner has had to adapt to the situation. In addition to the original question, another question that is more modern and easier to understand has been added. Applicants can choose one of the two. However, you must understand that this does not mean that the examiner's literary style has changed. Candidates, if you are not preachers or lecturers, you must follow the wind.</p>
<p>English Emphasizing Structure</p>
<p>English also focuses on essay writing. There are several points to note. Simple words are better than cold words, and short sentences are better than long sentences. If you insert a passage that you think is good, but it destroys the grammar within the sentence, it is better to maintain the structure of the entire text. As for rhetorical devices, not much attention is paid to them. In middle school, you may have read the works of Shakespeare and Milton, but do not think that adding a few sentences to your essay will increase its merits when taking the entrance examination.</p>
<p>Physics: Sound, Light, Mechanics, and Electricity</p>
<p>In middle schools, both teachers and students tend to value mechanics and electricity while downplaying acoustics and optics. In practical applications and for the sake of allocating energy, we may have to make some distinctions, but from the perspective of coping with exams, this concept, especially in recent years, is unacceptable. In recent years, the number of physics exam questions has decreased compared to before the war, but ask yourself, which year does not include acoustics and optics? However, if candidates can read a common middle school chemistry book, such as the textbooks written by Blank and Conner or Smith, they can cope fairly well.</p>
<p>Mathematics Especially Emphasized</p>
<p>The mathematics subject includes algebra and analysis, mainly based on the Fan's version, but now it needs to be supplemented by Hall and Knight's Algebra to have more assurance. Analysis currently only tests plane geometry, removing solid geometry. Among them, the two sections on tangents and conic sections are the most important. For textbooks, you can choose to read either Liu Nai's or Smith and Gale's books. Others, such as Windsor's or Granville's analysis, are abbreviated and not detailed, which is still not enough to take the Jiaotong University entrance exam. There are fewer trigonometry questions. As for other subjects such as history, geography, and civics, there are no special features, so I will skip them.</p>
<p>This year, the departments of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and civil engineering each recruit forty people. There are usually slightly fewer applicants for civil engineering, so the chances of admission seem to be higher. After all, civil engineering is offered by more than just Jiaotong University. Those who are interested in this field can develop in many directions and do not have to be confined to one place.</p>
<p>Before this article ends, I must add one more sentence. You should strive for an average score in each subject, and you must not have a particularly poor score in one subject. Otherwise, if one subject is below twenty points, all your efforts will be in vain. There is no fixed standard for admission. The overall average of each subject is the criterion for selection, but it is also a fact that physics, chemistry, and mathematics are given slightly more weight. Therefore, candidates should not feel discouraged if they feel that they have performed poorly in the first day's exam and give up on the subsequent subjects. As long as you remain calm and give it your all, you will have a good chance of success.</p>
<h3>Wielding the Knife and Waiting with Bated Breath</h3>
<p>— Xu Ping</p>
<h3>Autumn Sea Hall</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>11. Midnight Song</p>
<p>She asked so carefully, just short of asking Mei Bao to bring out her family's petty cash book for her to see.</p>
<p>"Fields...?" Mei Bao also never expected that she would relentlessly inquire about their roots, but of course, she couldn't reveal everything to her. "There are probably only about ten mu or so, and as for business matters, you see, my father never leaves the village, so what kind of business can he do? I remember when we first came here, there was some cash hidden in our boxes, but now it's almost all gone. As for our relatives, we have fewer than anyone else. Apart from my uncle in Li Village, I have never seen another one..."</p>
<p>"Then what about your maternal grandmother? Your maternal uncles?" The Meng family's daughter-in-law couldn't wait to interrupt and ask.</p>
<p>"There aren't any. Mom died very early... very early!" Having said this so often in recent years, if she suddenly changed it, the Meng family's daughter-in-law would probably be the first to feel surprised.</p>
<p>The listener frowned sympathetically.</p>
<p>"In that case, your family's situation is really quite difficult. Sister, I'm not saying this to upset you," saying this, she pulled the bamboo chair she was sitting on closer to Mei Bao, her face revealing an extremely secretive expression, as if the words she was about to say were related to the lives of everyone in the village. "Since your father doesn't have any money, why did you still go to school?" To be frank, in the mind of a rural woman like her, going to school is simply playing around. "For example, if you helped with some needlework at home, you could earn a few pennies. And..."</p>
<p>Before she could finish her words, Mei Bao shook her head.</p>
<p>"How much money can you earn that way? Good sister-in-law, you have to know that you can earn money by going to school as well. For example, you can become a teacher in the primary school here... "(163)</p>
<h3>These Years</h3>
<p>— Xia Zi</p>
<p>Few cargo ships arrive. By the Huangpu River, only a group of naked children can be seen defecating, swimming, and bathing.</p>
<p>At the So-and-So Coal Company, coal dust is piled high in the square, above the bamboo fence, where grass has even grown. But the retail department has a porcelain sign that reads: "Retail Coal Balls, Limited to Two Jiao Per Person."</p>
<p>In the candy section of the movie theater, the boy in uniform stretches his head out at the entrance, waiting anxiously. In the foreign company, the ice cream delivery truck, the previous truck delivered two hundred dozen ice creams, all sold out during one break.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Wu Ziqing</p>
<p>Being beaten by the door man for going to the theater is "luck."</p>
<p>Being whipped for buying cheap rice is "poverty."</p>
<p>Parents being given the cold shoulder by their children is "fortune."</p>
<h3>Division of Labor and Cooperation in the Family</h3>
<p>— Lu He</p>
<p>These past few days, the old maid has returned to her hometown for personal matters. Although my mother has repeatedly gone to the employment agency to hire one, she has never been satisfied with any of them. The reason is that during this rice planting season, most of the maids have to return to their hometowns to farm, and housewives are generally unwilling to easily dismiss the better workers. Therefore, most of those who are still lingering in the matchmaking shop are newcomers who are not used to working.</p>
<p>But the most important problem in life—food—cannot be skipped for a single meal, and the clothes that have turned oily black cannot be delayed any longer. Under such difficult circumstances, we specially held a tea party and elected my eldest brother as chairman. The result of the discussion was ten articles:</p>
<p>1. All attendees are members of the executive committee and have the obligation to supervise and encourage each other.</p>
<p>2. Assign the two sisters-in-law to be responsible for washing and cooking.</p>
<p>3. Stipulate that I and my fourth brother are jointly responsible for sweeping and cleaning.</p>
<p>4. My third brother is solely responsible for purchasing sundries and running errands.</p>
<p>5. As for the remaining five, seven, eight, nine, and three brothers, they will all be raised by the sixth brother and please mother.</p>
<p>6. When necessary, or if a person is unable to perform their duties, the other members of the committee may assist them. However, they must not use this as an excuse to shirk responsibility or engage in fraudulent activities such as laziness. Otherwise, once discovered, in addition to being fined a breakfast, they must also be fined one day's pocket money, which will be used as a reward for diligent workers.</p>
<p>7. Those with excellent performance will be awarded bonuses or prizes by the chairman to encourage them.</p>
<p>8. These rules have been approved by all the committee members, so once work is assigned, no objections may be raised. However, if necessary, they may be handled in accordance with Article 7.</p>
<p>9. These rules are subject to revision at any time and will take effect from the date of publication.</p>
<p>Truly, since the implementation of the family division of labor and cooperation, vivid and lively good phenomena have appeared everywhere. Even those who were unwilling to work in the past have cheered up and worked diligently, without relying on others. In this way, "not only can we develop the habit of self-reliance, but also save dozens of yuan a month in expenses. Thirdly, we can be particularly assured about the hygiene of our meals. Moreover, it is more clean and interesting than when we had a maid. I think that in these days of expensive rice and wages, this method can be adopted by general families.</p>
