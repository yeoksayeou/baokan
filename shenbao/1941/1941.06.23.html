<p>社評</p>
<h3>蘇德戰事的爆發</h3>
<p>蘇德間終於發生了戰事，世界史上又掀起了新的一頁！</p>
<p>蘇德這兩個一向立在對蹠地位國家的以兵戎相見，本是前些年世人所認必不可免的事；然而當綏靖政策一度抬頭之後，蘇聯爲了避免資本主義國家的圍攻，德國爲了减除兩面作戰的危險，竟使蘇聯與民主國間的互助談判功敗垂成，到促成了蘇德間的意外接近，而歐戰的爆發亦遂無可避免。這一戰爭，從東北歐洲發動，蔓延到北歐，在西歐發揮了重大的戰果，然後沿着丹瑙河發展到巴爾幹和地中海，經過了二十二閱月之後，現在却又重新回復到原來的出發點，這樣的結局，大概是當時簽訂蘇德不侵協定的當事人所萬不及料的。</p>
<p>首先需要指出的是：在蘇聯與納粹之間固然存在着從思思以至政制的種種矛盾；此次的戰爭，却亦是複雜錯綜的國際利害關係使然，不能視爲兩種主義兩種政制的爭鬥，正有如前此蘇德接近之不能視爲共產主義與納粹主義的調和一樣。是以對於此一戰事只能從實際情勢上做具體的觀察。</p>
<p>納粹夏季攻勢不在英倫海峽或大西洋爆發，反而出人意外的重溫「我的奮鬭」中東進的陳夢，這同然表現着攻英的無把握，但另一方面，又未嘗不是希特勒的深謀遠慮。從不侵協定簽訂以來的蘇德關係來看，雙方之間所存在着的只有在相互猜疑中的武裝和平，絕不是眞正的互助互保。蘇力之所以拋棄了自已所一貫倡導的集體安全原則，轉而介與納粹的相互保證之下謀自身的安全，這固然是張伯倫綏靖政策有以促成，同時也可看出蘇方對於遭受納粹進攻的危險極爲重視。在希特勒心目中，烏克蘭的食糧與阿塞爾貝然的石油都是建立納粹「新秩序」的要素，而年來對英作戰之持久不決，更使他的覬覦意念，日趨殷切以至不耐坐待。同時蘇聯在波羅地海的加緊鞏固國防，對丹瑙河流域與巴爾幹的露骨關切，又正是納粹所看做如芒刺在背的事。前此波蘭對德作戰時的遭遇，德國未必不自已引爲隱憂，其進攻英國之遲遲不發，除却實力未充而外，這恐怕也是重大顧盧之一。到蘇日中立協定簽訂，蘇德間的尖銳形勢愈益表面化，昨天爆發的一慕，至少在那時已在威廉街官邸中作實際發動的考慮和佈置了。巴爾幹與克里特的戰事結束後，德方並不做繼續東進的打算，對於伊拉克前當局的呼籲可以不顧，對叙利亞的戰事竟然旁觀，已可見其注意之別有所屬。無論資源問題，中東問題，也無論爲了鞏固歐陸佔領區域抑或繼續對英作戰，都可以從封蘇一戰中獲得總的解決，假使倖能一戰而勝，當前種種困難不難迎刃而解。希特勒此際所從事者，大概就正是這樣一個如意算盤。</p>
<p>據昨天消息：德方在集結盛大實力而外，並利用芬蘭羅馬尼亞對蘇的領土糾紛爲助，從北泳洋到黑海發動了對蘇的全面攻勢，莫洛托夫昨晨九時（上海時間下午六時）的宣言，也明白接受了德方的挑戰，這一比較去夏西綫戰役規模更大的鏖戰已經沿着蘇聯全部的西疆展開。比較兩軍實力，在數量方面的略相埓，而蘇方則有更多的後備人力；在質量方面，就前此兩軍之分別進攻孟納漢防綫與馬奇諾防綫的戰績比較，則戰鬥力不無軒輊。不過紅軍的歷史與素質，縱然經過了許多變遷，至今依舊不能估量過低，有如納粹所一再運用而奏效的傘兵戰術，就是蘇聯所發明的。去春蘇芬戰事結束之後，蘇方曾把軍事人員自伏羅希洛夫起大事更調，並根據蘇芬及西綫兩役的經騐積極從事訓練，又取消政治委員制，以集中各級軍官的職責，其效果如何，當不難從此度戰役中獲一解答。單就軍事方面而論，如果沒有特殊變化發生，希特勒所慣用的閃電攻勢，此次未必能保持以往的作戰紀錄，這不只因爲蘇聯幅員之異常廣袤，德軍將正與日本的侵華遇到同樣困難，並且蘇方也早已有所準備，把經濟產業與國防的心臟安排在遠離西疆的安全地帶。是以假使納粹目標只在烏克蘭與巴庫，則由於地理位置關係，也許能夠倖獲一逞，不過在善於運用焦土戰略的斯拉夫民族，却未必肯讓敵人輕易得到這些無價的寶藏。如果希特勒用意在於以兵力脅迫蘇方後收其所謂新秩序抑或想根本擊潰蘇聯，則利鈍正未可逆睹。根據常識判斷：此一戰爭一旦爆發之後，其解決當非咄嗟可決，至於希特勒之是吾因爲已有特殊把握纔甘冒兩面作戰的危險，則尙非此際所能判明。</p>
<p>此一事變的發生，自然是國際大局的一個重大關鍵，在各方反響尙未表明之前姑先加以保留。有一點可以說明的，就是在前此的醖釀期間，雙方都曾在外交方面積極策動，除了業已見之的章的蘇日德十二的而外，赫斯的赴英與克里浦斯的返國也都是其間的重耍挿曲，此其成就如何正與軍事實力同樣具有左右雙方前途的重大作用。假如民主國與蘇聯之問因爲共同對納粹作戰的緣故而捐棄嫌怨，使兩年以前已歸幻滅的集體安全運動獲得復活，則混沌的現局，未必不因而漸次透露光明，雖然這一共同作戰仍須經過艱苦的歷程。倘若彼此之間仍舊視如胡越，坐觀成敗，則自然是希特勒所樂聞，而此後的納粹勢力亦如日中天而莫可予毒了！</p>
<p>德蘇兵戎相見　日本大爲震驚</p>
<p>合衆社二十二日東京電　此間官方頃對德國向蘇宜戰之訊、大爲震驚、但對此項局勢、於日本有何影響、拒不詳論、日外相松岡接獲日駐德大使大　所報德已攻蘇之後、立即將此訊及其他問題報吿日皇、又據同盟社稱、明晨政府與大本營或將開聯席會職、此項會議顯係研究日本所處地位之問題、觀察家相信、日本因德戰日三國同盟條的及蘇日中立條約之存在、共地位頗爲複雜、似將暫採觀望政策、若干觀察家則以爲日本因蘇日條約關係、尤　最近蘇日友誼關係之宣言、或將疎遠德國、又有若干觀察家則以爲日本或將竭力調整對美之關係、又有人們以爲此項局勢於日本又爲一種影響、而將等待時機、以與荷印作再度之談判云、</p>
<p>路透社二十二日東京電　德蘇宜戰後、日政府定叫晨九時召集政府與　高統率部之緊急聯絡會議、日本駐德大使大島將軍於過午之後、即將此項發展通知日政府、數小時後、外相松岡進宮向日皇報吿、在明晨聯絡會議之前、似未必有仟何官方反響可得、據日方半官消息、謂某外交界方面宣稱、德蘇戰事不僅造成極複雜之國際局勢、旦於歐戰之外、又引起全世界資本主義與社會主義之衝突、預　英美蘇一國或將締結同盟、此次戰事之促成、係由於蘇聯阻礙接濟德國·貝薩拉比亞之交還·及蘇聯對於德方進攻巴爾幹之態度、</p>
<p>路透社二十二日東京電　紐約及柏林發來德蘇戰事之急電、已由各報號外向民衆公布、並曾引起一般之驚異、因截至最後一分鐘爲止、民衆對於兩國即將交戰之傳言尙無聽聞也、官方對於德蘇戰事之批評、目前尙不可得、惟聞政府人員刻正會商此事、</p>
<p>羅國領袖昭吿將士　收回失地此其時矣</p>

<p>合衆社二十二日瑞典京城電此間咋日獲悉瑞典及芬蘭之邊境、現已幾完全封鎖、邊境巡邏亦已增强居住瑞典與丹麥間之交通、實際已成斷絕、</p>
<p>芬作納粹工具　美國引爲遺憾</p>

<h3>全國財政會議席上　蔣委員長訓詞　建立財政經濟基礎　推行糧食土地政策</h3>
<p>蔣委員長對財政會議訓辭原文如下、今天第二次全國財政會議與綏靖會議舉行開幕典禮、剛才主席訓詞、說明會議的意義與任務之重人、各位必能徹底認識、本人今天就主席所說的話、再補充幾點意思、對各位同志貢獻、本來綏靖會議與財政會議的性質、有許多地方是互相關聯的、亦就是耍後方的軍事與政治配合起來、共同一致的來鞏固抗建的基礎、因此我今天對於全國財政會議幾個根本問題所提示的意見、出席綏靖會議的各位同志、亦須留心諦聽、期能切實互助、一致進行、自從國民政府成立以來、全國財政會議　開過兩决、第一决會議爲裁撤全國的釐金第二次會議爲廢除各地的苛捐雜稅、這兩件大事實行以後、使國民經濟排除了重重的障碍、民生得過其自由發展、都是關係於國家的重大改革、但這兩决會議所成就的還是屬於消極的性質、着重在（除弊）的一方面、今天我們舉行的第二决全國財政會讓、其任務與過去兩决會議相同、而是完全要仟</p>
<h3>積極建設</h3>
<p>的工作、要在抗建之中、將國家財政健全的建設、而且要建立國家財政永久的基礎、換句話說、就是對於全國財政要通盤籌劃、與合理的支配、不使各省建設事業尤其是經濟建設、像過去有貧富肥瘦畸形不均的現象、而能使之普遍的平衡發展、政府今爲要達到這個目的、所以必須先要確定兩個目標、（一）全國財政收支能使之平衡、（二）國民負担能使之平均、這兩點近代政府抗建的基本政策、所以大家要認淸這次財政會議、決非普通會議可比、其任務上僅在實行田賦劃歸中央、及確立財政收支系統而已、這兩件事固然是此次會議的主耍方案、但就會議所要貫澈的整個精神與根本性質而言、這次會議實在是關係國計民生、是建國前途最重要的會議、我們回想到國民政府成立以來、財政上所經過的艱苦困難小知幾多、到如今抗建已經四年、不僅對內對外國家財政沒有什麼危險的現象、而且祇有一天一天的健全穩固、由此一方面可見我國國民經濟潛伏力量的偉大、一方面也足以表現我們政府所推行的政策之穩健與正確、和過去艱苦奮鬭所得成績之難能而可貴、各位須知我們現在持久抗建下來、而財政之所以尙能維持到如此程度者、就是由於法幣政策之成功、這法幣政策是什麼？今日不妨明言之、就是我們總理所中張的、</p>
<h3>錢幣革命</h3>
<p>的成功、我在民國二十四年視察各省入川的時候、見到各地方幣制之複雜、眞是使人害怕、因此研究人民之痛苦、與社會之黑暗、各種弊端的癥結、皆在於此、更由此推想到如果國家對外一有戰事、則財政經濟更將混亂不堪、直將制國家的死命、所以我國如耍實行民生主義、而且能够應付內外一切艱局、惟一要務、就是在財政經濟上必經統一幣制、先使法幣能暢通全國、乃可使人民不致再受過去剝削的痛苦、而戰時亦不致受金融財政紛亂的影響、所以我當時一到四川、除了四川的行施消防區制而外、同時決定對中央必須貫澈統一全國幣制政策、這種統一幣制的政策、是幾十年來大家都認爲非常困難而不能作到的、亦是過去者任何財政家所不敢做的、而我們財政當局似能够依照政府的政策、與總理錢幣革命的原則、不避勞怨、百折小叵的努力奮鬭、到後來果能澈底完成、因此我們抗建纔能獲得今天這樣的成效、當我們法幣政策推行之初、國內財政界金融界以及各商業銀行、當時都以爲幣制統一以後、必於他們的利益有很大的損失、在未開始以前、就有很多議論、表示完全反對、而且發生了很多的謠言誹謗、幾使全國市塲處理發生動搖、待到政府頒布命令、澈底實行以後、不僅金融界各銀行錢荘沒有受到任何損失、而且其一切營業反而突然猛進、商務亦格外發達、一切公私經濟事業、都能</p>
<h3>蒸蒸日上</h3>
<p>如果拿幣制統一前後的情形兩相比較、我國在推行幣制以後、所有經濟實業的發展、實有一日千里之感、這是近年來極顯明的一個事實、我們抗建臨到光榮勝利已經決定的今天、又是臨到一切最後的困難要待我們克服突破的時候、我們要回想到過去所經歷的一切險阻艱難、以及民國二十四年能統一中國幾百年來所不能統一的幣制、歷來所不能打破的惡習、使法幣能够推行無阻、使財政金融因之能盡量發展、過去這樣財政上最困難最紛亂的一個大問題、尙且能够完滿解決、那以後財政上還有什麽困難問題不能解決、然而這完全是時代的進步、亦是我全國人民的智識思想進步、以及全國金融界實業界能够識大體明大義、一致擁護政府的政策、不惜犧牲小我的利益、而來貢獻於國家、所以能够得到今日抗建這樣的功效、我們由統一幣制的經騐、可以得到一個定義、就是「凡事有利於國家人民的亦必有利於個人、」所以政府對於有利於國有福於民的政策、無論遭遇任何困難、必求貫澈到底、而且這種政策是沒有不成功的道理、我們現在要確立建國的財政基礎、必須將全國田賦收歸中央經營、國家財政收支系統與地方自治財政收支系統、亦必須劃分明確、然後國家纔可成爲一個現代國家、關於前者所說田賦一項、留待後面再加說明、對於後者財政收支系統、如果能分別確立、一方面就可使地方自治事業的經費、得有確實保障、新縣制就可如期完成即不致如過去之有名無實、一方面國家財政收支系統建立以後、不僅中央財政</p>
<h3>從此穩固</h3>
<p>而且各省一切建設事業、尤其是國防經濟事業、亦可以切實推進、決不致再有過去那樣不健全的畸形怪狀、而使邊遠地方民稀的區域、對國防重要事業毫無建設力量、反等於荒漠一樣、所以這兩件事實是目前整個國計民生上的基本要務、不止財政關係而已、無論此次財政會議與經濟會議各位出席同志、以及中央與地方負責主官、更要認淸這不僅是關係全國家財政經濟的問題、而且是關係於我們農工商學各界民衆生死存亡的切膚問題、所以大家對於今日財政政策必須同心一致貫澈到底、如此抗建作戰方能必勝、建國自可必成、本來作戰與建國、原是一件事情、我們因要建國、故要作戰、而作戰正是爲了建國、所以在作戰初起的時候、就已決定下了建國的基礎、而在作戰進行之中、更要努力建國的工作、在此時期、我們因爲要樹立建國基礎、所以提出三個具體的政策、竭盡全力、期在必行、第一就是實施新制、推行地方自治、如果新縣制能依照規定的計劃與目標、切實作到、使地方自治辦有成效、國家政治就有了鞏固的基礎、一切建國工作亦就可以完全成功、第二是財政收支、</p>
<h3>應求平衡</h3>
<p>人民負担務使其平均、前者須要政府能够遵照決議、與預算貫澈開源節流的原則、就不難辦到、至於後者關係實最車要、在此抗建時期、我們決不能使一般富有的人不出錢、而反使一般窮苦的大衆來負担國家的經費、這是最不公平的一件事、今後必須切實反正、以求國民負担的平均、但耍平均國民負担、首先就要整頓全國稅收、而要整頓全國稅收、又必須由中央政府規定整個計劃、統一施行、纔能達到這個目的、第三是要實行總理的土地與糧食政策、本來在總理遺敎之中、關於建設國家財政與經濟事業、革命時期最大的要務是有三項、（一）是要實行民生主義、必須實行「錢幣革命」、就是要統一幣制、（二）是無論平時戰時、必須厲行「糧食管理、」專設糧食管理局、如果國家對於糧食不能管理、那麼民食軍糧就無基礎、這樣國家決不能成　現代的國家、</p>

<h3>希特勒宣言全文</h3>
<p>海通社二十二日柏林電　德元首希特勒對蘇聯所發表之宣戰書、已於今晨三時三十分由宣傳部長戈培爾宣讀、其內容略謂、蘇聯已在出賣與德國所簽訂之友好條的、蘇聯並與英國聯絡、推進針對德國與整個歐洲之政策、迄今已有一年餘之久、蘇聯今在德國東疆結集大軍一百六十師、德國今爲阻止此項牽制軍事行動起見、乃被迫決定與芬蘭·羅馬尼亞二國結成聯盟、重以德國與人民之將來命運、置於吾士兵之手中、元首宣言之全文如次、</p>
<p>德國人民、國社黨同志、余慎重其事保守緘默、迄今已歷數月、時至此際、余乃能坦白言之、一九三九年九月二十三日德國接獲英國宜戰之時、英國仍一再企圖阻撓歐洲之團結、幷對歐陸最强之國家、進行戰爭、一九三九年夏英國復開始行其世界大戰時之故技、欲以包圍政策、毀滅德國、製造種種謊言、謂各國民族均已遭受威脅、向之提供援助與保障之諾言、使之對德作戰、實與世界大戰時之情形相同、一九三九年五月至八月間、英國連續向世界廣播共諾言、謂立陶宛·愛沙尼亞·拉特維亞芬蘭·貝薩拉比亞·烏克蘭等均已直接遭遇德國威脅、其中若干國家受其惑、乃接受英國之保障諾言、加入包圍德國之陣綫在此種情形之下、余乃担負德國民族歷史之重任、以事實保障被奐國謊言所惑之國家、幷先安定東疆之地位、以吾人之利益範圍爲限、德國人民對蘇聯人民從未懷有敵視之意、但莫斯科之猶太布爾雪維克統治者二十餘年來、始終以引起德國甚至全歐之烽火爲職志、德國從未企圖以國社主義輸入蘇聯、但莫斯科之布爾雪維克統治者、始終欲以政治手段與武力支配德國及歐洲其他民族、蘇聯此種活動之結果、僅使各國入於混亂及飢荒之境、反之、余在最近二十年來、則努力於生產工作、爲德國創設新社會秩序、此項國家經濟與社會政策之目的、乃在造成眞正之人民社會、消滅階級之不同、時至一九三九年八月、余在極端困難之中派遣外長前往莫斯科、努力於對抗英國包圍德國政策之工作、其時德國向莫斯科莊重保證所提出之領土及國家除立陶宛外、均在德國政治利益範圍之外、幷與之簽訂一項特別協定、以英國倘竟煽動波蘭對德作戰爲條件、此項協定內容、對有關各國境內之日耳曼人、頗爲苛刻、的有五十餘萬日耳曼男女被迫離開其成家立業之地、夤夜逃返本國、但仍有數千名日耳曼人神秘失踪、其下落無從探悉、其中有一百六十人爲德國之公民、凡此種種、余當時不得不保守緘默、並望最後能緩和此緊張關係、但當吾軍開入波蘭之時、蘇聯統治者突然違反條的、提出立陶宛之要求、德國從無佔領立陶宛之意、亦未向立陶宛政府提出此項要求、反之、德國曾拒絕立陶宛當時之政府要求德軍開入立陶宛之申請、雖然如此、余仍同意蘇聯之新要求、波蘭戰役勝利之後、余曾向西方國家提出和平建議、卒因國際間之陰謀與猶太戰爭煽動者之拒絕而未成事實、蓋當時英國抱有動員歐洲聯盟對付德國之望、包括巴爾幹與蘇聯在內英國政府後復決定派遣克里浦斯爲駐蘇大使、前往莫斯科履行促進英蘇關係之訓令、並使蘇聯產生親英之傾向、一九三九年秋與一九四〇年春、其效漸顯、蘇聯竟以武力征服芬蘭與波羅的海各國、其動機虛偽而可笑但余仍持絨默、詎知克里姆林宮之人物得寸進尺、德國於一九四〇年春遵守所謂友好條的之規定、將德軍自東彊撤退、其時蘇聯已在開始集中軍隊、此種措施實可視爲對德國之故意威脅、據莫洛托夫稱、一九四〇年春波羅的海各國境內有蘇聯軍隊二十二師、蘇聯政府雖掩飾其意義、但具有對德示威之作用、不言可喻、當一九四〇年五月十日德軍在西綫擊潰英法之抵抗後、、蘇聯軍隊續在東疆作擴大行動、、一九四〇年八月後余乃考慮東疆不能再容其空虛一無防禦。其後蘇聯外交人民委員長曾向德國提出下述四項問題、</p>
<p>（一）莫洛托夫問曰、倘蘇聯進攻羅馬尼亞、德國對羅馬尼亞之保障亦將針對蘇聯吾、余答曰、德國對羅保障、乃屬一般性質、吾人將無條件加以遵守、蘇聯已向吾人宣怖蘇聯對羅馬尼亞除貝薩拉比亞外、並無其他利益關係、故佔領北布柯維納已屬違反此項保證、故余認爲蘇聯今不能對羅馬尼亞再存其他意圖、</p>
<p>（二）莫洛托夫問曰、蘇聯仍感受芬蘭之威脅、故決定不能再事容忍、德國無援助芬蘭之意吾、將撤退其通過基凱尼斯之軍隊吾、余答曰、德國對芬蘭仍絕無政治上之利益、但德國政府對蘇聯發動進攻弱小民族之芬蘭、認爲不能容忍、蓋吾人決不能相信芬蘭能威脅蘇聯、吾人亦不望波羅的海將引起戰爭、</p>
<p>（三）莫洛托夫問曰、德國能同意蘇聯向保加利亞提供保證、並派蘇聯軍隊開入保加利亞以資保護吾、莫洛托天並明言無廢除保國國王之意、余答曰、保加利亞乃一自主國余不知保加利亞曾吾要求蘇聯提供保證、如羅馬尼亞之與德國、但余願與余之與國討論此事、</p>
<p>（四）莫洛托夫問曰、蘇聯需耍自由通過韃靼尼爾之便利、並要求佔領韃靼尼爾與博斯普魯斯一帶之重要根據地、德國能表同意吾、余答曰、德國願隨時同意修改蒙德婁條的、以有利於黑海國家爲前提、但不能同意蘇聯佔領海峽一帶之根據地、余對此所持之態度、乃以德國負責領袖之地位與歐洲文化之代表而出此、其結果乃使蘇聯增加反德活動、立卽開始對羅馬尼亞與保加利亞之陰謀活動、羅馬尼亞乃有政變之發生、企圖推翻安托的師古攻府其時余仍以爲持絨默爲善策詛知蘇聯此次失敗之後乃在邊界一帶補充其集中之軍隊威脅德國、南斯拉夫戰役乃英蘇合作之證據、當余努力綏靖巴爾幹各國、邀請南國加入三國公的之時、英蘇兩國乃於一夜之間發動南斯拉夫之政變、此次塞爾維亞政變所受蘇聯之影響、甚於英國、吾人對之仍持緘默、蘇聯領袖乃復得寸進尺、德國政府今已搜獲蘇聯煽動塞爾維亞對德作戰之證據、蘚聯曾向之保證由薩洛尼加運軍火·槍械·飛機等物至塞爾維亞、此事發生之時、係在余敦促日外相松岡與蘇聯緩和緊張關係之時、白吾軍迅速進佔薩洛尼加後、蘇聯盎格魯薩克遜之陰謀遂吿失敗、至此莫斯科乃破壞德蘇友好條的幷洩露其內容、時至此際、余不能再事旁觀持以緘默、成爲德國人民之罪人、蘇聯在德國東疆結集軍隊一百六十師、破壞邊界之事迭有發生、六月十七日夜至十八日蘇聯步哨曾被砲火擊出德國領土、故已至必須採取行動對抗布爾雪維克之時矣、</p>
<p>德國人民乎、吾國士兵今巳與芬蘭士兵在北冰洋沿海駐防、保護芬蘭之領土、自普魯塞至黑海一帶德軍則與羅馬尼亞軍隊共同防守、此項戰綫幷非僅在保護一國、乃在保護全歐之安全、故余今已決定以德國與人民之將來命運置於士兵之手中、上帝佑吾、助吾作戰、一九四一年六月二十二日希特勒（簽字）</p>

<h3>中國交通界偉大貢獻　桐油車試驗成功　幾經研究改造方臻圓滿　每公里燃油僅二角四分　交通界權威來滬暢述在渝試車經過</h3>
<p>國產桐油汽車、本月四日在陪都重慶試騐成功、已見本報電訊、惟經製造經過、交通界及　械家頗多關懷、昨有交通界權威某君自港歸滬、謂在渝時、曾躬與桐油汽車試車盛典、據稱前以植物油車參加京滇公路週覽團之張世綱君、係中國汽車製造公司之總工程師、最近駕駛該公司自製成功之桐油汽車至重慶、邀集各界、赴　陪試車、由化龍橋至北殕溫泉、的六十公里、往返均爲一點半鐘、完全使用桐油，爬老鷹岩時、係用三檔速率至三十公里、其他各地、均爲四十公里以上、與汽油車行駛無異、</p>
<p>燃植物油　行駛汽車</p>
<p>中國汽車製造公司仿照德國朋馳柴油汽中、改用植物油行車、於二十六年該公司創立時、即着手研究、幸年餘即吿成功、二十七年春、行政院舉行京滇公路週覽團、該公司即派車參加、由滬至昆、復由昆經桂·粵·返滬、各處表演計程萬四千公里、成績極佳、隨車並未携帶油料、完全使用各省建設廳公路局代　就地出產之植物油、如上海市之棉子油·南京市之花牛油安微省之菜子油·江西省之芝蔴油·菜子油·湖甫省之菜油·豆油·貴州省之桐油·鴉片烟油·雲南省之菜子油等、</p>
<p>桐油行車　早奠基礎</p>
<p>在黔省初用桐油時、成績異常良好、發力甚宏、爲各油類冠、但因駛行稍久、機器內部即發生隙碍、在途中時常停駛修理、蓋桐油黏　頗大、油質容易變化、油面結皮、油管阻塞、致谷種　件、不能運動自如、惟成績雖未圓滿、而桐油可以行駛汽車之事實、確已於是時定其基礎、</p>
<p>研究改良　迭吿失敗</p>
<p>該公司董事長曾養甫氏認定桐油行車、爲作戰時　油之唯一辦法、旣已探得綫索、即應獲得其結果、遂鼓勵張氏重加研究、並添助理化專家多人、協助試騐、初係從化學方面人手、以防止養化之化學藥品材料、及其他稀薄油類滲人桐油中、藉防止其乾涸、改正其黏度、但結果炭質太多、汽缸容易損壞、故吿失敗、再從物理力面改革、在桐油箱內、加以外熱、以减薄其點度、並於停車　車時、換用柴油、使油管內無法結皮、但如斯辦法、增加機件頗多、手續繁重、管理困難、決非一般司機所能勝任、故亦未能認爲成功、</p>
<p>最後決定　根本改造</p>
<p>最後決定從桐油本身上所具之性能在製造工作上、即照其性能爲根本之改造、以桐油與柴油、各就其所含之熱力單位、互相比較、而定預燃室內之容量、使之完全符合桐油應用、是使桐油在預燃室內能充分氣化、在汽缸內得完全燃燒、不留絲毫炭質餘燼、故汽缸內異常　潔、機件不易發生障故、又增强桐油噴射時之壓力、以抵抗桐油內之濃厚黏度、使桐油在噴出時、能完全變成薄霧狀態、以便在預燃室內、得與高壓空氣緊密接觸充分氣化、並提早其噴射時間、以糾正桐油燃燒遲緩之弊、</p>
<p>障碍悉除　試騐成功</p>
<p>更嚴密封閉各沒路之通氣處、使空氣不能與桐油接觸、油面不能發生變化、油管即不致阻塞、發生障礙、冷率發動、改用火酒、啟動亦無困難、按照以上改良方法、該公司曾將共製造之新車多輛、經過嚴格之長期試騐、成績均極圓滿、國產桐油、代替舶來汽油柴油行駛汽車試騐、至此已完全成功、</p>
<p>自筑至渝　十五小時</p>
<p>此次張氏駕駛至陪都表演之車、其發動機即係該公司根據試騐結果、自行製造者、故使用桐油、極爲適合、該車由該公司桂林分廠出發來渝、計程一千二百公里、載貨兩噸半、完全使用桐油、機器方面、槪無發生絲毫障礙、速度每小時嚴高達五十五公里、平均速度爲三十五公里、由貴陽至海棠溪僅費時十五小時、爬山超嶺、比較汽油車稍緩、而能力頗好、各個山坡均得暢行無阻、與使用柴油時完全相同、</p>
<p>廿四公里　代價六元</p>
<p>桐油每巿　合十五加侖、桂林巿價每擔八十六元、每加侖價的六元之譜、在平地每加侖可行二十四公里、故每公里燃油、僅須代價二角四分、此决桂渝途中、消耗量平均爲每加侖十八·三公里、所有桐油概係在市內油店購買、並非精鍊者、蓋經過精鍊之油、揮發性被蒸去、發力不大、馬力减弱、用量較多、成績反不良好、購得之油、用土布濾過、即可加入汽車油箱內應用、過濾方法、與豆腐店濾豆汁相同、</p>
<p>大麯茅台　燃燒發動</p>
<p>冷車發動、馬用少許火酒、大麯茅台、亦可使用、淸潔機件、則用沸水、油垢立刻除去、裝盛桐油、則用竹簍、故此次該公司表演車、所用燃料及其處理方法、概係我國最常用之老法、可稱爲完全國貨、</p>
<h3>蘆溝橋作戰　四週年　各界正準紀念　兩和界殊戒備</h3>
<p>七月七日蘆溝橋戰事四週紀念將屆、本巿各界、因處特殊環境下、不作　何紀念儀式、惟對此具有歷史意義之偉大節日、均已籌劃紀念辦法、積極準備、頃據大光社記者探悉、本市兩租界警務當局、以現値默局緊張、滬市處境重要、爲維持租界治安、確保公共安寗起見、屆時將提前實施緊急戒備、其防範情形、將較以往更爲嚴密、藉防意外、聞在紀念前後一星期、並取締任何集會游行、以免不良份子　機滋事、</p>
<h3>盛澤一帶日兵　時遭襲擊</h3>
<p>頃據吳江來人云、吳江縣屬盛澤一帶、位於蘇嘉路與太湖之間、地勢衝耍、平時有日軍二三十人駐守、惟散居該處之忠義救國軍、時出襲擊、以致日軍驚惶萬狀、距今一週前深夜、忠義救國軍一部、乘日人不備、以迅雷不及掩耳之姿態、衝人鎭內、日兵倉惶不及應戰、折損甚多、迨吳江縣城之日兵聞訊、亟派大隊來　、華軍已安然引退、</p>
<h3>五月份滬市貿易　出超一億餘元　交通迄今仍能維持原狀　必需品已得有充分接濟</h3>
<p>自歐戰擴大、交通運輸發生困難、世界各國之貿易、莫不遭受打擊、本市係國際最大都市之一、而太平洋航路、迄今尙能維持原狀、故本市與外國貿易、非特未受惡劣影響、反能因此而日趨蓬勃、昨據江海關發表、本市五月份對外貿易、進口價値共二六·〇九八·九四四金單位、合法幣七〇·六四九·八四一元、出口價値一九七·六八八·五九二元、統計出超達一二七·〇三八·七五一元之多、實開本市歷來罕見之紀錄、</p>
<p>食糧仍佔　輸入首位</p>
<p>五月份輸入貨物中、仍以食糧佔據首位、總値爲八·九九八·六四〇金單位、較上月份仍見增加、其中又以洋米爲大宗、計五月份進口共達五五五·九七一公担、値四·八七六·九八〇金單位、自緬甸進口者佔十分之五、爲二四〇·七二二公担、其次爲安南二一七·七二一公担、再决爲泰國八九·九八二公担、自一月至五月、本市洋米進口、已達三·六一一·八九二公担、可見本市民食、絕對無虞、</p>
<p>棉花油類　大宗抵滬</p>
<p>佔進口數量第二位者爲棉花、蓋本市始終爲一紡織業之中心故也、其進口價値爲五·六六二·四一一金單位、來自印度者佔總數二分之一、美棉數量亦殊可觀、油類進口則佔第三位、價値一·五八一·八五四金單位、來源以荷印佔二分之一弱、其决爲美國等處、僅汽油一項、即達六·八六八·四七三立德爾、二二三·六四九金單位、至於柴油輸入、則達八·四六〇噸、三一九·七六二金單位、本市燃料現狀、可見尙未至惡化之境地、</p>
<p>糖市貿易　突然躍進</p>
<p>往昔在進口數量中地位微細、而今則一躍而爲第四位者、則爲糖類、總値達一·一五八·〇六七金單位、十分之六來自荷印、其數量所以驟增者、據悉因商人恐南太平洋發生糾紛、而大量訂購之故、佔第五位者爲紙類、價値九六七·一七四金單位、由美國輸入者佔三分之二、决爲台灣等處、除以上各類外、輸人較多之貨物、有化學物品金屬等、</p>
<p>金屬內運　以供建設</p>
<p>至以出口貨物而論、往昔原以紡織品爲最多、但五月份金屬製品、則已躍登首位、價値達二九·〇六三·一八九元之多、就中以鐵類所佔數量最鉅、輸出地區、以廣東租借地（九龍）爲最多、其價値達一〇·三九八·九〇八元之多、據聞係轉往自由中國供建設之用、其决爲印度菲列賓荷印等處、則可信爲供軍用也、出口第二位爲紡織品（包括絲織品在內）、價値二八·九六六·五四七元、二分之一以上係輸往美國、次之爲日本印度、</p>
<p>滬棉織品　暢銷國外</p>
<p>佔出口貨第三位者爲棉織品、値一五·三四六·三七二元、輸往荷印最多、决之爲美國及香港印度、佔第四位者爲紡織製成物品、値一八·六九一·七六六元、以輸往香港印度安南爲多、第五位爲動物製品、値一四·五八四·三九二元、輸往美國者四分之三、次之爲日本、除以上各類外、輸出較多者、則有雜貨穀類等、</p>
<h3>日人在虹口　嚴查戶口　憲兵崗位亦增加</h3>
<p>自虹口及越界築路迭有日人被暗殺後、日方對於該區住戶之調查、較前更爲嚴厲、據平胡社記者所悉、上週內虹口區內住戶、均有日本憲兵二名、前拌逐戶調查、將住戶之人口·姓名·職業等項、塡寫于其携帶之表格內、同時虹口區內日憲兵崗位、亦吿增多、每崗位已由一名增至三四名不等、外白渡橋一帶、尤爲顯著、又悉虹口市民聯合會亦于一週前由該區保長甲長等分發調查戶口單、命按戶塡寫具保、聞將來每月每戶須繳治安費一元、以作該維持之經常費、</p>
<h3>美十二輪接航遠東　航程保守秘密　各輪決按期駛行載客貨　一週以內航程或可排定</h3>
<p>美國航務　員會徵用美國總統輪船公司所屬總統輪七艘、作爲海軍輔助艦之後、此間總統輪船公司當局、爲資海上行駛安全、防止一切不可能發生之意外起兌、茲後該公司之船隻航程、以及駛美各輪船名、均將保守秘密、前定之船期悉予取消、此種步驟、不僅效法協的國於參戰期內之審愼步驟、當茲美與德義關係緊張情勢下、實必要之處置、以後各補充新輪船期亦未定、故有重行排訂之必要、</p>
<p>亞當輪已　取消環航</p>
<p>此間輪公司已獲總公司來電、該調駛遠東之十二艘總統輪、決按班駛來上海、載貨搭客、以代七輪徵用之缺、本定於七月二十四日由美處女航環航世界來滬之亞當士總統輪之行期、亦已取消庇亞十總統輪之行期、將吾更變、現未決定、惟該輪爲列入被微名單之一、容有守秘密必要、</p>
<p>美輪十二　常川駛滬</p>
<p>新行調駛遠東之十二艘總統輪、除范盤倫總統輪與卜克總統輪現仍泊於船廠、尙未完工外、其餘下艘、將儘先駛來、其中茄菲爾與孟羅總統輪、係同范盤倫·卜克總統輪·傑克遜總統輪·爲姊妹船、各載重萬六千噸、乃最近航務委員會建議新造者、共餘白却南·約翰遜·戴勒·與菲爾摩總統輪四艘爲貨船、其他四艘麥迪遜·格蘭·哈立遜·泰來等總統輪四艘據悉原屬於前大來公司所有、久已擱置未用、現公司對該上述舊輪、巳在舊金山船塢大加修理、以便早日駛來遠東、維持航行、</p>

<h3>波蘭代表廣播　繼續奮鬥　民主國家須緊隨合作</h3>
<p>本埠英大使館情報處長亞力山大氏所發起之民主集團國家同盟、於每星期五晚上、在XMHA電台作廣播演說、上週演說者、係波蘭代表、略謂、德國不顧德波不侵略協定、進兵波蘭、蘇俄又繼其後、侵入吾國東疆、吾人曾竭力抵抗、終因兵力懸殊、遂致國土淪入敵人之手、惟吾國人民上下一心、自始至終、並無賣國之行爲發生、吒實可引爲自慰、目下波蘭人民處於「新秩序」之下、整千成萬之人民財產被剝奪、生命被摧殘、無家可歸者、尤指不勝屈、一有違抗納粹之命令、即被殺害或監禁、所謂自由與文化二詞、早已不見於波蘭境內矣、歐洲多數國家、已均處於納粹鐵蹄之下、希脫拉昔日所謂和平、僅以廢棄凡爾賽和的爲已足者、今已撕破假而具、實現其統治歐洲之野心、吾人必牢記不忘、民主集團國家現正爲國家自由尊重個人之民主原則而奮鬥、吾人須緊隨合作、以圖實現此種信念、今波蘭與捷克已完成第一步矣、此後不論戰時或和平吿成之後、亦必同心一意與民主國家同進退、吾人之祖國有二、即一爲本國、一爲英國、吾波蘭全體人民、當如何爲祖國加緊奮鬥努力乎、</p>
<h3>上週罪案趨减</h3>
<p>據工部局警務處發表、近月內發生罪案均逐月親跌、上週內公共租界發生犯罪案件、共計三二六件、較前减少四件、緝獲案犯四五五名、較前减少十一名、現界內警備、除由該處白俄預備隊加入外、並有美駐滬防軍協助、警務實力、已益增强、</p>
<h3>霉季已屆亟思脫手　米巿讕言聳聽　時局變化與米運無關係　巿價受平米覊絆難操縱</h3>
<p>自上週末一般大囤戶製造各種謠言、企圖抬高米價失敗後、刻又散播讕言、謂工部局向港方訂購洋米、已發生困難、企圖混亂市塲聽聞、共用心殊堪痛恨、記者昨特往訪接近當局之某君、叩詢其意見、據稱、</p>
<p>囤戶時　思破壞</p>
<p>自工部局採辦洋米在本市普遍開始出售起以迄於今、一般大囤戶、無時不思加以破壞、惟當局爲澈底解決本市民食起見、決心排除困難、毅然實行、非特獲得全市民衆之擁護、即各正當米商亦一致與之切實合作、使本市米價得以抑平、最近市價、難有倐升倐落之象、但與工部局洋米之售價、相差有限、致使一般囤戶、旣無法居奇操縱、又感脫售困難、彼等在堆棧中所囤積之洋米百十萬包、以時屆黃霉季節、米質極易發生變化、</p>
<p>企圖誘　致盲從</p>
<p>基於上述情形、一般囤戶、除在巿塲造作各種讕言、企圖誘致一般盲從之徒、大量購買外、別無他法可想、致於工部局第一期所採購之港米二十八萬包、除已先後運抵達二十二萬包外、其餘六萬包、決可於月內抵滬，第二期港米、各雜糧行亦早已開始向當局訂購、其數量已達六千餘噸、（即六萬餘包）首批預計的於下月初旬左右運滬、訂購數量旣無限制、來源亦不致有中斷之　、故米　之無　　　、決不可置疑、」云云、又據航　界消息、　和公司之永生輪、昨午由港　滬、載來洋米一萬包、</p>

<h3>本巿紡織業之前瞻</h3>
<p>— 聶光中</p>
<p>上海紗市自去夏暴跌後，至去歲十月份起，因滇緬路復開與內輸交通稍暢，方見復蘇氣象。開春以來，一因日軍佔領粵西海岸，加緊沿海封鎖；繼因泰越紛爭，遠東戰機有隨時爆發可能；以及日本對淪陷區市塲坨制之加緊，本埠又因節的煤斤而减供電力等等，一般人樂觀心理，重復黯淡；一部份紗廠，二月底起，且實行减工。嗣因市內血案頻生，中交四行一度停業；紗價乃彙緣金漲而飛步昂昇，一般廠商，因之又轉憂爲喜。然曾幾何時，年初種種不利因素。益見深重，四行復業，謠言盡息。益以中美中英滙兌平準借款之成立，平準操作之力行；滙價大鬆，金價崩潰；紗市乃傾盆下瀉。至於今日，金價正大跌小回，一蹶不振；獨紗價反拾級而上；如上週末情形，且成暴漲局面，實屬不可思議之事。</p>
<h3>棧單枯竭之眞相</h3>
<p>商品交易，即使投機，究亦以實際供需爲決定要素。目前二十支雙馬現貨激漲，咸謂棧單告緊，籌碼不足所致。此亦可謂爲供需定律之演化。惟棧單吿緊，純由多頭收進關住所致。統計紗市每日之成交數，什九爲同行交易，客幫銷胃，渺不足道。有如下表：（單位元）</p>
<p>同行交易之爲投機性質，果已盡人皆知。實則所謂客幫交易，際今貨運艱困之日，亦不乏低進高出者；客幫也者，與證券幫金子幫等名稱，不過指明其出處而已，何曾都是實銷。旣非實銷，存底自亦不减。至於多頭關進棧單目的不外乎逢高拋售。故今日籌碼之暫短，即來日籌碼之充斥。不言而喻。</p>
<h3>存紗日積而月累</h3>
<p>米市與紗市不同。米以本街爲主要消費地，而其供給區在外埠；囤虎故有就地操縱之可能，然仍不敵公賣廉米之打擊。紗則適得其反。以本街爲供給區，而其主耍消費區則在外埠。惟有對外貨運暢通時方有求過於供之日，俾囤紗者以有囤必賺之佳運。不幸此時此地，外銷極少可能。而紗價之騰漲，反促使廠商增產，拋售期貨。故囤紗者決不能像囤米者堅持不出，因其最有把握之遭遇，當推生產過剩以致供過於求。</p>
<p>據Finance　＆　Commerce　所載，截至本年二月底止，本市現有中外紗廠六十七家，共有紡錠二百六十四萬餘錘。其最高產紗量每月可達一三〇，〇〇〇包。三月以後，日商紗廠减工五成以上，英廠亦减工三成模樣，華商繼而亦减少夜工。但其時全市紗產量仍達七萬五千包以上。共後雖因節减電力，華商續有减工者，然五月初紗價猛漲以來，加工者亦先後相繼。故目前產紗量月的九萬包至十萬包</p>
<p>供給雖在增加，客銷則仍無起色。就本年各月存紗量之消長言，最近似已受减工影響而在漸降，然與去年同期比較，則無月不增，且所增殆皆超過五六成以上。可見目前紗市投機之劇烈，亦可見其前途危險之如何深重。</p>
<p>上項存紗數，尙限於堆棧中而言。若就全市推算，當在三十三四萬包以上。鑒於運輸之困難，實銷之淸淡，紗價反漲，刺激紗廠之增產，則今後棉紗存底，當有繼續增加之趨勢可下。</p>
<h3>存棉與時而俱增</h3>
<p>就實際銷路　，本市棉紗，仍以西南各地及淪陷區爲主。輸往南洋各地者，則的佔百分之十左右，其地位固不甚重要。但近來海岸封鎖未弛，浙東鬥戶父閉，淪陷區市塲又禁止移入，南洋局勢正日緊一日。國際上外交活動雖仍飄忽不定，但大勢所趨，美蘇已臨參戰邊緣。今後國際局勢如無突如轉變，棉紗去路終無法打開。生產過剩，程度將更嚴重。原棉需要，自必减低。</p>
<p>若美國參戰　美棉輸華當成問題。惟實銷去路當亦同歸於盡。且近來因外滙回鬆，廠商乘機結進之棉花爲數至鉅。加以三月間一度减工，棉紗消費亦减，故目前本市棉花存底，亦在激增。即以目前紗廠開工情形計之，目前存棉量，已足供今後五個月以上之消費。</p>
<p>紐的棉市，近月雖在步漲中，（目前每磅比上月計漲美金一分左右）幸上海對美滙兌，亦在繼續放長中，兩者足以相抵，廠商負担得未因此加重。至於運輸船隻，總統輪被徵後已指定替代者來滬；誠以上海爲美國在華權益之最大而又最後之堡壘，其作用存在一日，則運輸條件與商務關係，亦必存在一日。可以斷言。故本市棉紡業之命運，不在原棉而在實銷。實銷一日不能打開，紗市之脆弱脚地，即無改進之一日。</p>
<h3>空頭貼出之內幕</h3>
<p>然在此時此地，實銷不振，實屬不可補救之宿命。外有羅網，內有機器，經之營之，唯投機交易是賴。明知投機交易，以暴漲暴落爲其本來面目；有識者均知遷地爲良。但近視者不此之圖，反利用投機事業，造作種種計謀，以冀維護紗價於較高水準。所作所爲，不一而足。彼等明知此非持久之計，但求暫時抬高紗價，藉以盡量拋售現期各貨，獲得類乎搶帽子之利益已足。及紗價回跌，則損失者已屬別人；已可安心生產早已高價拋售之期貨；待所有拋售之高價期貨生產足額後，如紗價猶無起色，則可再作道理。如先前雙馬市塲，名謂現貨交易，實則並無期限；此卽所以獎勵囤紗也。對於多頭征收貼息，復收棧租，此即所以使其成本加高，以保證紗價之日上也。紗價上漲，乃得較其他爲速。但在最近，由於紗價上漲太高，又因空頭亦可不受期眼東縛。且因多頭尙有種種負担，而做空則否；故咸改趨做空，尤以本年五月初紗價暴漲以來，雙馬市塲上空頭之地位更覺有利。因之生產過剩之紗市，益見共一蹶不振。</p>
<p>際今囤積猖獗，百物高漲，民生凋敝之日，舉凡足以抑制物價上漲之事，毌論其動機何在，似均可謂有益民生，應暫予保留。若多頭貼息辦法，即其一例。不幸所謂雙馬市塲當局，不此之圖，一反前制，於上週創設空頭貼出辦法，替囤紗多頭開一出路。可將其利息負担，轉嫁於空頭。大有唯恐人之不囤紗，又唯恐紗價之不漲者然。</p>
<p>自創設空頭貼出辦法以來，疲莫能興之紗價，於是在多頭加碼，空頭翻多之下，連盤橫跳，上週間每包竟暴漲近百元之譜。空頭貼出辦法之對於抬價計劃，可謂已克盡厥責矣。然若謂紗市從此可唯投機是賴，而得起死回生，則孰能信之？</p>
<p>就投機者之觀點而論，做多應付之利息，雖可以空頭貼出者抵償。但事實上，多頭僅能取得空頭貼出數之一部，另一部份爲居間人所得。故多頭仍需部份負担利息，且仍需給付棧租，故其總負担實亦不亞於空頭。受其惠者，僅投機銀號耳。</p>
<h3>現貴期賤愈走愈遠</h3>
<p>不寗唯是，在紗產過剩，存貨堆積，而外銷因運輸困難等等關係，極少辦法；國際大局，愈演愈危；大勢所趨，無可樂觀。試回顧所謂期紗市塲開張迄今，期紗價輒比現紗價小至五六十元之多；至於上週，現紗暴漲近百元，期紗听漲不過四十餘元。故兩者差額今已達百元之巨。紗市前途之黯淡可知。（單位元）</p>
<p>當所謂期紗開拍之初，實力雄厚之投機者，已向現紗市塲拋售現貨，而向期紗市塲買進，從中取得其套頭巨利。在此塲台，期紗價照理應與現紗價背道而馳；事實上期紗竟仍隨現紗進退。至於今日，因現紗遠較期紗爲貴，故現紗空頭，縱謀補進，亦都改補期紗，故期紗之成交數，幾與現紗者相埒，依理期紗應與現紗比例進退矣；事實反又適得其反。現紗正在暴漲，期紗所漲反極有限，尤堪耐人尋味。</p>

<p>我國近代紡織工業，萌芽於一八九〇年；十年後就遭英商來華設廠的競爭；又五年而日商繼之。第一次歐戰時期，外商壓力暫鬆，民族產業方得喘息機會；其時華商紗業，發展尤速。然而日商的競爭，亦同時加甚。截至八一三戰前，全國紗錠總數內，華商僅佔五〇％，日商佔至四五％。英商則侷居滬濱一隅，地位已不重耍。戰事旣起，華商紗廠，或爲砲燬，或爲日人「代管」。倖存者僅上海租界區內。統計華商在戰前所有之二百六十二萬八千鍾紗錠，燬於砲火者達一百二十萬鍾；遭日人控制者佔八十六萬二千鍾。惟上海租界區及西南各省新設之小規模紗廠，爲數不尠。</p>
<p>支數　棉紗粗細，用支數表示。每支長八百四十碼，中外一律。如十支紗，即長八千四百碼；二十支紗，即長一萬六千八百碼。支數低其紗粗。反之則細。大致十九支以下者稱粗紗，二十支以上者稱中紗，四十五支以上者稱細紗。</p>
<p>紗包　棉紗交易，以包爲單位，亦稱件。每包凈重四百磅。每包內分四個草包，每個草包內分十個小包；每一小包（或稱一梱）重十磅，依支數而分爲若干紗團。如十支紗者分十個紗團；二十支　分二十個紗團。每個紗團內則一律分成十大絞。每大絞內又分七小絞。每小絞一律長八百四十碼。小包用紙包裹，草包用草袋包裝。大包（即包）則用蔴布爲包皮而束以鐵倏。報載紗價及賣買時之叫價單位，均以一大包爲單位。</p>
<p>種類　棉紗種類，可以支數分，如十支紗二十支紗是；可以粗細分，如粗細紗是。就工程分，則有單股雙股多股及順手反手之別。單股以一紗條紡成，二十支以下者都屬單股紗。雙股即用二根紗條紡成，故又名之爲錢。三十支以上細紗有用三紗條撚成者，此即所謂三股。撚紡時，紗錠向右轉者稱順手；向左轉者稱反手。農村間手工木織機之用紗，均屬順手。但機器織布，則依其機器　置而定其用紗之宜順御反。此外有雷光紗及乳色紗之類。前渚用高速度機器，使紗條經過電光之火熖，而將紗條上之細毛燒去，成爲光澤出品。後者則浸入苛性遭運水中而使之外觀有如絲光。</p>
<p>品質　鑑定棉紗品位之優劣，取決於（一）色澤良否？（二）粗細均勻吾？（三）撚合强弱？（四）毛茨多寡？若顏色光澤，細而均一，可以伸長，毛茨較小，是爲上品。交易所開做棉紗，故先鑑定各　出品之品質，而定其等級；復指定何種紗爲標準品，俾決其同級與不同級之各種紗價　加應减之限度。</p>
<p>成本　棉紗之成本，大別爲二：一爲花本，一爲製造各費。花本即所用原棉之價値。大致每件二十支紗之用花約三百五十磅左右。以原棉時價乘以用棉量，即花本部份。製造各費，句刮工資，動力，以及管理，稅捐，水火保險各費之每包扯價。依目前情形而論，每包二十支紗之總成本不致超出一千三百四五十元之上。今日紗價漲出甚巨，廠商獲利之厚，概可想見</p>
<p>紗廠　紗廠爲紗市的基木供給者。八一三戰前，上海全市共有華商紗廠三十一家，擁有錠子一百二十三萬七千餘錘，年產紗錢五十四萬包以上。布機八千七百五十餘臺，年產布疋十五六萬方碼。此外在滬日商紗廠達三十三家，擁有錠子一百三十五萬八千錘，布機一千三百六十餘臺。英商紗廠四家，擁有錠子十八萬七千錘，布機二千八百九十餘臺，故早呈喧賓奪主之勢。戰事旣起，凡在租界區外之紗廠，受戰事燬損者達二十一家之多，爲日人「代管」者十家，但租界區內，新設紗廠，則如雨後春筍，截至本年二月底止，上海現有之紗廠及其設備，大體如次表。</p>
<p>據估計，全市中外紗廠現有之錠子如全部開工，則其最高之產紗量，每月當在十五萬包左右，需用原棉約十七八萬包。</p>
<p>原棉　國棉因織維短，故支數較高之紗，均需攙用美棉之類。故棉花進口，素爲上海對外收支上最大負担之一。戰前如此，戰時尤甚。因淪陷區內棉產，統爲日人控制；過剩棉產之售於上海者，去年全年不過四十餘萬包；故各廠用棉，更需依存於進口不可。在此匯價波動不定，國際局勢變幻莫測之中，廠商最注意者厥爲棉之來源。唯其如此，故每當外匯放長，廠商即大量進口，因之本市原棉存棧量，經常維持足供半載以上之需要。</p>
<p>銷路　紗爲吾人衣着之主要原料，上海因紗廠林立之故，向爲全國棉紗主要供給區，毎年轉出口爲數頗巨。八一三戰事發生後，華北市塲，已爲日商關閉，繼之而又關閉華中以至華南淪陷區之門戶。因之本市棉紗之出口，僅女限於自由區中國，近年又注意於南洋市塲之開發。但此新市塲之納胃，至多僅佔總產量百分之五六，全部始由本市織布廠及西南自由區吸收之。去秋日軍加緊我沿海封鎖，繼之英人關閉滇緬公路。內鎖門戶，完全關閉。本市紗業，因之而幾乎完全窒息。停工减工者接踵而起，紗價之慘洛亦無以復加。於此可見西南銷路實爲本市紗業之生命綫。</p>
<p>市塲　本市棉紗買賣，戰前本以華商紗布交易所爲集中市塲。戰事一起，該所就奉令停業。繼之有投機商人組織的黑市塲，幾經遷移，現在北京路同利古里某號樓下，同屋樓上就是日紗市塲。指定以二十支雙馬紗做一切棉紗交易的標準，名謂祇做現貨，事實上並無期限約束。現在某方在愛多亞路上另設一期貨市塲，開做一個月至二個月期的交易。同樣用二十支雙馬做標準，不過名之謂「金雙馬」，而將現貨雙馬稱之爲廠單，以示區　。雖則如此，現貨雙馬依然有名無實，照樣可以買空賣空，不過多頭每天要貼出利息，此息是銀號之類的一大收入。空頭則無什麽負担。但從上週起，空頭每天也要貼出，此款因由多頭收入，所以多頭的利息負。但投機者決不會吝惜這筆負担，他們追求的是更大的利益。</p>
<p>貼息　這是銀號之類最大的收入，目前棉紗投機，五包起做，每包棉紗値一千四百五十元左右，五包共需七千七百五十元。假定扣除證金二百元，則名義上銀號已代多頭墊本七千五百五十元，月息都以一分一計，則多頭每月負担的利息便要九元多。此外還要負担棧租和佣金。事實上銀號並不眞的墊款替多頭買進，他們最多只依本號當天所做多空雙方相抵下來的多頭餘額買進罷了。如果軋下來的餘額是空頭，那就根本不要墊款買進。然而他對每個多頭顧客，却都照收利息。現在這筆利息，改由空頭貼付。最後仍歸銀號收用。而且因爲這貼出額常在變動，其分配權又屬之銀號，故多頭未必能全部　進，銀號從中尙要分　其一部。此又一生財之道也。所以投機者的勝利是屬於銀號的。　（註）本　已經張先生修改與增補</p>

<h3>五金　本元釘巿勢呆滯</h3>
<p>久無起色之本廠元釘市勢、邇來依然呆滯、因其惟一去路之南洋羣島、目前一無搜納、而北洋幫及長江路內河客商等進意亦淡、故成交僅依本街之小廠家、及零星用戶等、交易當然淸閒、人心亦難見振作、市氣仍然萎衰、近市開價每桶倍司價仍喊一百六十元、較之前市未見榮辱、惟底盤殊見鬆動云、</p>

<p>衣食住行</p>
<h3>王丹老之衣食住行</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>丹揆先生，品行高潔，係江蘇有名之耆宿，交卸導淮委員會委員後，隱於農，著書立說，問雨課晴，怡然自得。事變後，旅居滬上，患鼻癌，因年老力衰，竟於本月十七日作古，越日在中央殯儀館大殮。門生故舊往送者頗夥，談及此老之得以長壽，（八十二歲）得力於衣食住行之有節制，摘錄一二，以實本刊。</p>
<p>先生原籍南京，隨宦至崇明，都閻公歿於崇，眷屬竟不能扶櫬回籍，乃葬於東北城外附郭，而遂居於崇。平居家貧力學，故對於「衣」，向用棉織品，而不求其美。庚辰通籍，由庶常散館部曹，赴南洋考察商務，洊歷商部參議右丞，仍抱大布之衣主義，而鮮製綢衣，對於家人所穿之服，亦力戒奢侈。蓋崇明產棉，渠家風主勤儉，不僅自種自紡，並且自染目製，淸潔樸素叫字，足以當之。生平無不良嗜好，對於鴉片更恨之剌骨。其尊、萍　先生錫其名曰清穆，含有勗其效法林文忠公處爲名儒出爲名臣之意。先生以文忠政績，禁鴉片，溶劉河爲最者，故對於鴉片之害，撰勸國人拒毒文，並函外交部向英交涉香港鴉片官賣，口誅筆伐，不遺餘力。對於水利，著太湖流域治水防災策，及視察劉河七浦白茆水利說略等書，議論透澈，有益民生。「食」不求美，抱飮食約而精，園蔬愈珍羞之旨，故晚年即素食。鑒於米價飛漲，平民生活維艱，除著說米文三篇外，曾上書當道，主查需食平米之戶，編造册籍，而令殷富者捐資以辦平糶，按人口之多寡，而定平糶之數目，計口授糧，不致偏枯，所定辦法，公正詳明，足資取法。「住」不主張營華屋，於民國四年，營葬其父母之靈櫬於距城五十里堡鎭西之大石橋後，即於墓左築室以居，名曰農隱廬。讀禮之餘，整理墓田，廬之左右後三面，闢溝蓄魚，溝北有竹園，門　有荷池，有小花園，路側溝旁，分植榆梓槐柳之屬千數百株，儼然農家。平日，目儕於農，而與村夫野老相過從，因感建築時鄉人贊助之德，即名此區曰德義村。創立社倉仿朱子春散秋歛之法童並捐置求己小學校，附設農作試騐塲，俾課餘兼習農事，暇時與農民共話桑麻，不啻桃花源第一。事變後，即遷居滬上，所租房屋，狹小異常。鑒於上海二房東之貪得無厭，曾爲文勸吿，奈誨者諄諄，聽者藐藐，此亦人心不古，祇重金錢，不守道德之明證。「行」的問題，與先生大有關係，淸季蘇浙兩省鐵路商辦之議甚熾，先生被舉爲督辦，而首創滬杭甬鐵路，辛亥曾擬有勸蘇路股東收回南錢路款組織銀行之說略，除詳述鐵路國有與商辦之利弊外，對於消政府當時大借外債，以增國人之負擔，主嚴加監督，說甚透澈。前年尙著有中國　辦鐵之路痛史，而歎路歸國有，商辦股本或還或小還，人民投失尙小輒借外債而興築，利權剝喪，路債期限延長，人民損失之大，不可數計。至其個人之行路，則少年主張徒步，晚年亦未備包車，安貧樂道，更足資模仿突。</p>
<h3>紐約的中國夏季時裝</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>取人之長，補已之短，故余常主中學爲經，西學爲緯，中西交流，而學術大成，精神文化如此，物質亦何獨不然？中裝之優點在舒適。病在不便，西裝之優點在便利，而病在緊窄，如果交相爲用，取長補短，豈不大妙？頃讀紐的通訊稱。「…五月二十五日，美國援華之中國週日，閉幕時，在紐的愛斯都大旅社，Hotel　Astor舉行中國布疋展覽會，招待新聞界，廣爲　傳，其中如龍鳳，古錢，丹蝶，花姑，人物等式樣，皆具中國古時風味，古雅悅目，極受美當地，美國婦女界之熱烈歡迎。現美國著名織迭廠家六十五家，已一致參加織造，依上列各種式樣，織造四百五十萬碼，定爲一九四一年式樣。…同時中國旅美之張蒨央女士，復於六月四日下午，假畢爾蒂摩大旅社，Biltimore　Hotel演講中國式樣，對於美國婦女一九四一年夏季時裝式樣之影響，有所闡釋。且謂伊本人所介紹之中國式樣，非直接抄襲中國樣本，乃係間接影響之結果；例如伊在杭州所見「荷葉出水圖」，問接　發其「華傘」形態之改進，而影響其所介紹　傘」之式樣。張女士已與美聯合後軍會保持密切接觸，推進中國式樣…」云云。予常見西婦之穿中國旗袍者，嬝嬝婷婷，姿態絕美，而自命前進之中國時代女子服飾，反多買主的活，還有木箱，風爐等贈品。時至今日，不要說贈品不中不西，寗不可怪？珍愛國粹，應注意吾國固有之「夏季時裝一，而匠心栽製，發揚光大，跂予望之。</p>

<h3>一星期家常菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>初夏上市的菜蔬與豆類，刀豆　老了，靑椒也辣了：恰釗好處的，要算是茄子。茄子有二種，細而長的是寗波種，粗而帶圓錐形的是本地種，寗波種子少而性糯，非本地種所能及，目前價格每斤在二角半左右，從經濟上着想，也可以吃吃了。我們一家都愛吃茄子，所以這幾天，天天在吃。董的做法，有三種，一是茄了嵌肉，將茄了肚挖空，把猪肉斬成了末，和以上好醬油，嵌將進去。二是油炸麵拖茄子，用雞蛋打碎攪和，放在麵粉內，將茄子切成一段一段的，拖了麵粉油炸。三是蝦子炒茄子，這很簡單，只須向南貨店買些乾的蝦子，和茄子同炒就好了。至於素的做法，一是用甜醬與茄子同燜，一是淸蒸茄子，拌了醬麻油或麻醬同吃，都很可口。</p>

<h3>煤球的今昔</h3>
<p>— 荊樹森</p>
<p>豆腐肉價鈿一這句語，本來是句形容　價高昂的話；但是到了現在，差不多可以說：「已成事實了。話雖如此，若是把它同別種物價米作個比較的話，那末，道和戰前相差不到十倍的價格，並不怎樣算貴！因爲這里還有更貴的物價可以吿訴你們！</p>
<p>什麼更貴的物價呢？我想讀者們一定會指出一百五十塊錢一石的米價吧？是的，米價的確貴得可以，但是它和戰前相差的比率，還小過十五六倍之間；惟有十七八塊錢一担的煤球，它要超過戰前的價格一十餘倍之多，這一個比率，眞够駭人聽聞！</p>
<p>我們人的生命，全靠吃來維持；除掉瓜果之類可以生吃外，其餘的東西，都非熟食不可？像在鄕村地方，還可以利用別種植物做燃料，惟有在這都市的上海，因爲人口，地位和設備的關係，非用煤球不可！</p>
<p>記得戰前的煤球，不過七八毛錢一担；如果你是老了，連正式的貨品都買不到。往往出了貴的價錢，買來劣等的貨品。人心不古；至於斯極</p>
<p>近日的報上，有一位自稱「上當人」的，登着一幅大大的關於煤球的吿白，這倒是一位苦口的有心人，値得我們的稱頌！</p>
<p>其實，做生意賣買，本是將本求利的正當行爲；不過在這國難期中，幹着囤積居奇，妄抬物價的勾當，已經是觸犯刑章；現在旣抬了人家的價，又要給「當」人家上，這豈是「人」應該做的事！雖然商人的好利，甚於寡人的好色，可不要「忘」了自家門上掛的「貨眞價實，老少無欺」這「八」個字啊！</p>
<h3>海外「住」的新談</h3>
<p>— 新亮</p>
<p>紐約某百貨公司中最近裝置了一種新型的燈光設備，簡直與日光一無差異。它們在白色的牆壁里裝了許多一千瓦特的Nova－Lux　燈，燈先從牆壁間反射出來，旣柔和，父燦爛，人們還以爲它就是太陽光呢。在晨晚開關的時候道種新奇的燈光也不是驟亮驟熄的，大概要經過十五分鐘的矇矇矓矓，這不是活像太陽還沒升起，或將要沒下之前的一瞬那嗎？</p>
<p>芝加哥的西爾斯，呂布克百貨店是全世界唯一沒有玻璃窗設備的店家。建造這一座房子的工程師說在這種不裝玻璃的建築中調節空氣與配備燈光要比其他的容易管理些。並且營業的開銷也可减去不少；店裏的貨色可以不再暴露在强烈的日光下而受損了；屋外的嘈雜自可統統免除，何况我們又可賸出許多墻壁間的地位來堆放商品呢。</p>
<p>簡訊：古拔路一四九號存德中學主辦現代名人書畫展覽，將於月之二十七日起正式開幕，展覽二天，至二十九日閉幕。在售款中提出二成，專作獎學貸金之用。同時，更把中小學全體回學的勞作科出品，如玩具，繡物，編結等，實行義賣。此舉嘉惠淸寒子弟，實非淺鮮。</p>

<h3>自殺</h3>
<p>— 覺慧</p>
<p>要講到眞正能够閃古爍今，永垂不朽的事，沒有比自殺再適當點的了。</p>
<p>自殺起自何朝，創自何氏，都已失了經典的攷據；但自古巳然，則也不必諱言。不信，有的是：</p>
<p>從前女人不可以輕易給人看見。有一個閨閣繡女因爲「不知怎的」被「油滑浪子」瞟了一眼，回去哭了三天，餓了三天，就默默地吊死在樑上。</p>
<p>從前男子除了讀書求功名之外，也不准拋首露面的。有一個書香子弟因爲「親自」到街上去買了一塊大餅，他的老婆得訊後就立刻跳井而死。</p>
<p>由此證明，現在的自殺非特是「好古以求」；並且還是個，祖傳秘方！</p>
<p>但方法是科學化了：生鴉片，來沙而，砒霜，電，黃浦江沒有蓋，等等。</p>
<p>原因也擴大化了：家產賭光，一身是債；脂粉市塲，二手空空；情塲戰爭，三角敗兵；也有道道地地爲了沒有飯吃。等等。</p>
<p>然而進步雖　步，哄動却遠不如古！先前自殺了也許再有立貞節碑的希望；現在却連施棺材都岌岌如也；大概事情一多，便不足爲奇。</p>
<p>其實平心想來：「好死小如惡活」；活着拚了命也還能做兩件事業，死了眞有鬼嗎？</p>
<p>尤其在目前，今天，就這一分鐘，我們簡直找不出一點兒自殺的理由……</p>
<p>自殺的都是些阿Q嘴裏的「蟲豸」！</p>
<h3>談學費</h3>
<p>— 許達明</p>
<p>在沒有一樣物件小吿飛漲的今日，學費一項，當然是難能例外的。因爲敎職員的生活費用，也在跟着物價的高漲同時上昇着，而校方的支出，也就不得不增大，所以，我們說，由於不得已的加價，那末，在今天是「情有可原」的——爲了共渡這一個「難關」。</p>
<p>但是，我們不能不加以注意的是：藉口「開支浩大」，而校長把學校也當作「投機市塲」來運用的。</p>
<p>所以，正當全滬各學校紛紛議論下學期學雜等費如何增加的目前，我們有提供辦法的必要。</p>
<p>這裏可分兩方面來說：</p>
<p>首光，關於私立學校方面，這問題是比較地嚴重的，因爲私校學費的增减，其大權操之於校長一人之手，但，這不是沒有辦法的。其一，即發揮集體的力量—全校（或先分級的實行，慢慢的再擴大成全校性的，可較爲容易）學生家屬必須有組織，或者負審查的責任，這樣，也可以使自己孩子的學費，收到學校與家庭雙方合作的效果。同時，更可以聯絡敎師來共同監督。</p>
<p>其二，我們知道私立學校在上海是大部份領有「工部局私校補助費」的，那末，工部局華人敎育處除了在事先的考核和調查各校的設備上應負之責以外，對各校收到補助費　經濟的去路，却更値得注意，尤其是對學雜費等的開支，華人敎育處應負責加以顧問，而免使學生家長的負担加重。這，我們盼望能配合着上面的一點，同時進行，得而發揮更大的力量。</p>
<p>其次，我們也得顧到公立學校的加費問題。</p>
<p>但，這，不是不能解決的問題，在工部局方面講：第一，把加費的比率降低而自動减輕學生家長的負担；第二，增加免費學額。第三，我們在「小學敎師」月刊上曾經見過盛振聲先生的「小學半日兩部制，的施行報吿一文，讀後頗覺這種性質（學費低而書籍用品由工部局供給）的學校，工部局應該儘可能的大量增加，而使界內兒童得有普遍入學的機會，不過有一點，得注意，就是這種性質的學校也應增加爲五六年級的完全小學，因爲小孩干四年畢業後，在今日這樣不合理的社會制度下，要我職業，似乎是件比登天還難的難事。這，在華人敎育處方面是該力爭的。</p>
<p>至於在學生家長方面講，那末，也可以聯名要求學校當局說明加費加得如此大法的理出。</p>
<p>總之，學校應諒解家庭的艱難，家長也該明瞭學校的情形和苦衷，（指有些眞正爲辦學的學校而言），大家能互相體諒，互相了解進而發揮互相幫助的效果，而得渡今日的難關，才是第一條上策，至於只顧少數私人的利益而一味孤行，那，我們就該毫不客氣地用集體的力量來加以制裁的！</p>

<p>Havas, Stockholm, 21st - According to Soviet sources, most of the foreign women in Moscow who were dependents of foreign envoys have left the Soviet Union for their home countries. For example, dependents of German diplomatic personnel returned home a month ago. After the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Cripps, returned home to report on his duties, the families of British diplomatic personnel also left one after another.</p>
<h3>Major Changes in the International Situation: Germany, Italy, Finland, and Romania Declare War on the Soviet Union; The Warfront Extends from the Arctic to the Black Sea Coast; Nazi Air Force Bombs Important Soviet Cities</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin Urgent Telegram, 22nd - German Leader Hitler announced today that Germany, together with Finland and Romania, has declared war on the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Havas, Rome, 22nd - The Italian government declared war on the Soviet Union at 5:30 AM this morning (2:00 PM Shanghai Summer Time). The declaration of war has been submitted by Foreign Minister Ciano to the Soviet Ambassador.</p>
<p>International News Service, New York, 22nd - According to the National Broadcasting Company, Berlin radio announced that the combined forces of Germany, Romania, and Finland launched an attack on the Soviet Union at dawn today.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 22nd - Official Moscow Radio announced that this morning German planes bombed the Ukrainian cities of Estonia, Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Sevastopol, and Kaunas. The radio said that the air raids killed and wounded 200 people. Kaunas was formerly the capital of Lithuania, and Kyiv is the third-largest city in the Soviet Union, with a population of over 500,000. It is a transportation hub connecting Warsaw, Kursk, Lviv, and Odessa. Sevastopol is located on the Black Sea and is an important Soviet naval port with a vast harbor capable of accommodating the entire European combined fleet.</p>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 22nd - The official German news agency, DNB, announced today that the German Air Force carried out fierce attacks on Soviet airfields, troop concentration areas, fortresses, and military camps. The German Air Force apparently has a considerable advantage, having destroyed a large number of enemy aircraft in air battles.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 22nd - According to dispatches received by the "New York Times" from the Bear City, it is reported that the Soviet Union has completely evacuated civilians from an area approximately 60 miles behind the Polish border. All bridges in the area are prepared to be destroyed. A large number of fresh Soviet troops are successively arriving along the Dniester River, and a large concentration of Soviet air forces have been dispatched from newly built airfields behind Kyiv on the southern front. Furthermore, according to Rome, the Soviet Union has taken precautions to destroy all bridges east of the Prut River at any time.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Bucharest, 22nd - This morning, an official statement from Bucharest stated that on June 28, 1940, the Soviet Union used force to coerce the Romanian government, issuing an ultimatum and seizing Bessarabia and Bukovina. Now, German and Romanian troops have entered northern Bessarabia and Bukovina, attempting to recover the lost territories.</p>
<p>Hitler's Declaration of War: Accusing the Soviets of Plotting Against Germany</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels read Hitler's declaration denouncing the Soviet Union. The declaration accused the Soviet Union of occupying the Baltic states with the sole aim of targeting Germany, and compared Britain and the Soviet Union, saying that both countries were pursuing the same goals. It further stated that the coup in Yugoslavia was also organized by the Soviet Union. The declaration concluded, "Therefore, I have decided today to once again place the fate and future of Germany and its entire people into the hands of my soldiers. Now, German and Finnish troops in the north and Romanian troops in the south will fight together." German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop then stepped up to the loudspeaker and announced that Hitler had ordered German troops to attack the Soviet Union. (Full text of the declaration on page 6)</p>
<p>Most Inspiring Order for Eastern Front Soldiers; Warning to the People to Guard Against Paratroopers</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd - Hitler recently issued a military order to the troops prepared on the Eastern Front, explaining the declaration he made to the nation this morning. The final section made the following appeal: "German soldiers, we are now entering a difficult and responsible struggle. The fate of Europe, the future of Germany, and the existence of the Germanic nation are now in your hands. May God bless us in this struggle."</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd - The German High Command broadcast this morning, warning the German people to "beware of paratroopers" in military activity areas, saying that enemy paratroopers may be attempting to carry out sabotage, and notifying civilians to report any paratroopers landing.</p>
<p>Molotov's Declaration: Denouncing Germany for Violating Agreements</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 22nd - Deputy Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, issued a declaration today, the original text of which is as follows: "To the people of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government and its leader, Comrade Stalin, have authorized me to make the following statement: At 4:00 AM this morning, German troops, without making any demands or declaring war, suddenly attacked our country. Several points on our border were attacked, and the cities of Zhytomyr, Kyiv, Sevastopol, and Kaunas were bombed by German aircraft, resulting in more than 200 casualties. In addition, enemy aircraft and artillery have been bombarding our positions from Romania and Finland. This attack is an unprecedented act of perfidy. The Soviet Union and Germany have a non-aggression pact, and the Soviet government has strictly adhered to all the provisions of the treaty. During the period of its implementation, the German government has not been able to find any pretext for Soviet violations. However, the German side has disregarded everything and attacked our country. Therefore, the responsibility for this predatory attack rests entirely with the German fascist rulers. At 5:30 AM, after the German troops began their attack, the German Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Schulenburg, on behalf of the German government, sent a note to the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, stating that the German government had decided to wage war on the Soviet Union regarding the concentration of Red Army troops on the eastern border of Germany. In reply, I, on behalf of the Soviet government, stated that even at the last moment, the German government had not made any demands to the Soviet government. Although the Soviet Union maintained a peaceful stance, the German side still carried out the attack. Therefore, the German side is the aggressor. Under the instructions of the Soviet government, I must state that our air force and troops have never violated the border at any point. From this point of view, the Romanian radio report that Soviet aircraft bombed Romanian airfields is purely a lie and a provocation. Hitler made the same lies and provocations today. Hitler is attempting to falsely accuse the Soviet Union of violating the treaty, but these accusations come too late. Now that the Soviet Union has been attacked, the Soviet government has ordered its troops to repel this predatory attack and drive the German troops out of our territory. This war, which has been forced upon us, was not launched by the German people, workers, peasants, and intellectuals, whose suffering we deeply understand. In fact, the war was launched by the cruel German fascist rulers who have enslaved the peoples of France, Poland, Holland, Norway, Denmark, and others. The Soviet government is confident that our heroic Red Army, Navy, and Air Force will fulfill their glorious responsibility and inflict a devastating blow on the invaders. We have repelled the attacks of arrogant enemies more than once. When Napoleon invaded Russia, our people responded with "fighting for the motherland," and as a result, Napoleon suffered a crushing defeat and was destroyed. Hitler is now launching a so-called new crusade war against our country and will suffer the same fate. For the motherland, for glory, for freedom, our Red Army and people will once again achieve victory. The Soviet government is confident that the entire nation, workers, peasants, and intellectuals will fulfill their respective duties. At present, our people must implement unprecedented solidarity. In order to support the Red Army, Navy, and Air Force and to guarantee victory against the enemy, every person must demonstrate the discipline and self-sacrifice of a true Soviet patriot. People of the Soviet Union, the government now asks you to further support our glorious Bolshevik Party, the Soviet government, and our great leader, Stalin. We are fighting for justice, the enemy will be defeated, and victory will be ours."</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Istanbul, 22nd - The Soviet ship "Svornatia" (4,125 tons), which previously sailed weekly between Odessa and Istanbul and Bulgaria, did not arrive this week. It is said that the ship has been suspended.</p>
<p>Soviet Air Force Sorties: Bombing of East Prussia</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 22nd - After Germany declared war on the Soviet Union, the General Command issued its first report this morning, stating that the Soviet Air Force attempted to bomb East Prussia, but was repelled by our forces, and several were shot down.</p>
<p>International News Service, London, 22nd - The press here has learned that Soviet troops are being mobilized on a large scale. Several fighter planes are concentrated near Leningrad, facing the Finnish border. Moscow Radio praised the Stalin 25 new model military aircraft, stating, "For the benefit of the Soviet people, the pilots are prepared to fly this new aircraft."</p>
<p>Arctic Ocean, Black Sea, and Baltic Sea: Berlin Announces Navigation Dangers</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 22nd - This morning, the German government issued an announcement stating the dangers of navigating the Arctic Ocean and Black Sea after the outbreak of the German-Soviet war. Minefields have also been laid in the Baltic Sea. All ships navigating the above-mentioned seas must pay attention.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Outbreak of the German-Soviet War</h3>
<p>The German-Soviet war has finally broken out, opening a new page in world history!</p>
<p>The confrontation between the Soviet Union and Germany, two countries that have always been on opposite sides, was something that people had considered inevitable for years. However, after the rise of appeasement policies, the Soviet Union, in order to avoid encirclement by capitalist countries, and Germany, in order to reduce the danger of fighting on two fronts, led to the failure of mutual assistance negotiations between the Soviet Union and the democratic countries, resulting in an unexpected rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Germany. The outbreak of the European war then became unavoidable. This war, which started in Northeast Europe, spread to Northern Europe, and had a significant impact in Western Europe, then expanded along the Danube River to the Balkans and the Mediterranean. After twenty-two months, it has now returned to its original starting point. This outcome was probably something that the parties who signed the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact never anticipated.</p>
<p>First of all, it should be pointed out that while there are indeed various contradictions between the Soviet Union and the Nazis, from ideology to political systems, this war is also a result of complex and intertwined international interests and should not be viewed as a struggle between two ideologies or two political systems, just as the previous rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Germany could not be viewed as a reconciliation between communism and Nazism. Therefore, this war should be observed specifically from the actual situation.</p>
<p>The fact that the Nazi summer offensive did not break out in the English Channel or the Atlantic but unexpectedly revisited the eastward advance in "Mein Kampf" not only shows the uncertainty of attacking Britain but also reflects Hitler's foresight. From the perspective of German-Soviet relations since the signing of the Non-Aggression Pact, the only thing that existed between the two sides was armed peace amid mutual suspicion, not genuine mutual assistance and mutual protection. The fact that the Soviet Union abandoned its consistently advocated principle of collective security and turned to the mutual guarantees of the Nazis to seek its own security was partly due to Chamberlain's appeasement policy but also shows that the Soviet side attached great importance to the danger of being attacked by the Nazis. In Hitler's mind, the grain of Ukraine and the oil of Azerbaijan were essential elements for establishing the Nazi "new order," and the prolonged indecision of the war against Britain made his covetousness increasingly eager to the point of impatience. At the same time, the Soviet Union's intensified strengthening of its defense in the Baltic Sea and its blatant concern for the Danube River basin and the Balkans were seen by the Nazis as a thorn in their side. Germany may not have been unaware of the hidden dangers based on Poland's experience in fighting Germany, and the delay in launching an attack on Britain, apart from the lack of sufficient strength, was probably also a major concern. With the signing of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, the sharp situation between the Soviet Union and Germany became increasingly apparent. Yesterday's incident was at least being considered and arranged for actual implementation in the office on Wilhelmstrasse at that time. After the end of the battles in the Balkans and Crete, the German side did not intend to continue advancing eastward. The appeals of the former authorities in Iraq could be ignored, and the war in Syria was even viewed as a bystander, which shows that attention was focused elsewhere. Whether it was the issue of resources, the Middle East issue, or whether it was to consolidate the occupied areas of Europe or continue the war against Britain, a general solution could be obtained from the war against the Soviet Union. If victory could be achieved in one battle, the current difficulties could be easily resolved. What Hitler is currently engaged in is probably such a wishful calculation.</p>
<p>According to yesterday's news, in addition to gathering a large force, the German side also used Finland's and Romania's territorial disputes with the Soviet Union as an aid, launching a full-scale offensive against the Soviet Union from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea. Molotov's declaration at 9:00 AM yesterday (6:00 PM Shanghai time) also clearly accepted the German challenge. This battle, which is larger in scale than the Western Front campaign last summer, has already unfolded along the entire western border of the Soviet Union. Comparing the strength of the two armies, they are slightly equal in terms of quantity, while the Soviet side has more reserves. In terms of quality, comparing the previous combat performance of the two armies in attacking the Mannerheim Line and the Maginot Line, there is a difference in combat effectiveness. However, the history and quality of the Red Army, even after many changes, still cannot be underestimated. For example, the paratrooper tactics that the Nazis have repeatedly used and made effective were invented by the Soviet Union. After the end of the Soviet-Finnish War last spring, the Soviet side made major changes to its military personnel, starting with Voroshilov, and actively engaged in training based on the experiences of the Soviet-Finnish War and the Western Front campaign, and abolished the system of political commissars to concentrate the responsibilities of officers at all levels. The effect of this will be answered in this battle. From a purely military point of view, if no special changes occur, Hitler's usual blitzkrieg offensive may not be able to maintain its past combat record. This is not only because the Soviet Union is unusually vast, and the German army will encounter the same difficulties as Japan's invasion of China, but also because the Soviet side has long been prepared to arrange the heart of its economic industry and defense in a safe area far from the western border. Therefore, if the Nazi goal is only Ukraine and Baku, then due to geographical location, it may be able to succeed, but the Slavic nation, which is good at using scorched-earth tactics, may not be willing to let the enemy easily obtain these priceless treasures. If Hitler intends to coerce the Soviet Union with military force and then accept his so-called new order or wants to fundamentally defeat the Soviet Union, then the outcome is uncertain. Judging from common sense, once this war breaks out, its resolution will not be decided in an instant. As for whether Hitler is risking the danger of fighting on two fronts because he already has special confidence, it is not yet possible to determine at this moment.</p>
<p>The occurrence of this event is naturally a major key to the international situation, and any reactions will be reserved. One point that can be clarified is that during the previous brewing period, both sides actively plotted in the diplomatic field. In addition to the already seen German-Soviet-Japanese pact, Hess's trip to Britain and Cripps's return home were also important episodes in the meantime. The success of these has the same significant impact on the future of both sides as military strength. If the democratic countries and the Soviet Union abandon their resentments because of the common war against the Nazis, and the collective security movement, which had already been disillusioned two years ago, is revived, then the chaotic current situation may gradually reveal light, although this joint operation must still go through an arduous process. If they still regard each other as strangers and watch the success or failure of the war, then it is naturally what Hitler would like to hear, and the Nazi power after that will be as powerful as the sun in the sky and irresistible!</p>
<p>German-Soviet War Stuns Japan</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 22nd - Officials here were shocked by the news of Germany's declaration of war on the Soviet Union but declined to elaborate on what impact this situation would have on Japan. Foreign Minister Matsuoka received a report from Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima that Germany had attacked the Soviet Union and immediately reported this news and other issues to the Emperor. According to the Domei News Agency, a joint meeting of the government and the General Headquarters may be held tomorrow morning. This meeting is apparently to study the question of Japan's position. Observers believe that Japan's position is quite complicated due to the existence of the German-Japanese Tripartite Pact and the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty, and it seems that it will adopt a wait-and-see policy for the time being. Some observers believe that Japan may distance itself from Germany because of the Soviet-Japanese Treaty, especially the recent declaration of Soviet-Japanese friendship. Other observers believe that Japan may try to adjust its relations with the United States. Some people believe that this situation is another influence on Japan and will wait for the opportunity to negotiate with the Dutch East Indies again.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd - After the German-Soviet declaration of war, the Japanese government decided to convene an emergency liaison meeting between the government and the High Command at 9:00 AM tomorrow. Japanese Ambassador to Germany General Oshima informed the Japanese government of this development after noon. Hours later, Foreign Minister Matsuoka entered the Imperial Palace to report to the Emperor. It seems unlikely that any official reaction will be available before tomorrow morning's liaison meeting. According to Japanese semi-official sources, a diplomatic source said that the German-Soviet war not only created an extremely complex international situation but also triggered a conflict between capitalism and socialism around the world in addition to the European war. It is expected that Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union may form an alliance. The promotion of this war was due to the Soviet Union's obstruction of the supply of Bessarabia to Germany and the Soviet Union's attitude towards the German offensive in the Balkans.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd - Urgent telegrams from New York and Berlin regarding the German-Soviet war have been published by newspapers and have caused general surprise because until the last minute, the public had not heard of rumors that the two countries were about to go to war. Official criticism of the German-Soviet war is not yet available, but it is heard that government officials are currently discussing the matter.</p>
<p>Romanian Leader's Proclamation to the Soldiers: The Time Has Come to Recover Lost Territory</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Rome, 22nd - Romanian Leader Antonescu issued a book to the soldiers this morning, saying, "I now issue an order, and the soldiers will sweep away the enemy troops in the northeast and liberate the enslaved compatriots, so as not to be chained by the Bolsheviks. Restore the old Bessarabia and Bukovina forests and lands of our country."</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Bucharest, 22nd - Romanian Broadcasting reported that the Romanian navy, army, and air force began general mobilization at midnight.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Bucharest, 22nd - Romanian leader Antonescu is now commanding the war on the Soviet-Romanian border and has appointed his brother Mihai as the Minister of State.</p>
<p>United Press, Stockholm, 22nd - It was learned here yesterday that the borders of Sweden and Finland are now almost completely closed, and border patrols have also been strengthened. Traffic between Sweden and Denmark has virtually been cut off.</p>
<p>Finland as a Nazi Tool: The United States Regrets</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 22nd - Officials here regard the German declaration of war on the Soviet Union as not surprising but regret the alliance between Finland and Germany, as Finland has been regarded as a friend of the United States. Democratic Senator George said, "The surrender of the Soviet Union seems unlikely, so the war between Germany and the Soviet Union can give England a few months to breathe. During this period, England can use the assistance of the United States to recuperate, and the United States can calmly implement the national defense program. This incident will never shake the position of the United States, only showing that Germany and the Soviet Union are not trustworthy." Representative Fish said, "The European situation is now more complicated, and the United States has a stronger reason to stay out of it."</p>
<p>United Press, Helsinki, 22nd - Although Helsinki was congested last night due to the sudden increase in military vehicle traffic, it was very calm. Railway traffic here is not out of the ordinary but cannot be compared with January 1939. The Finnish government's call for reservists to enlist has caused the work of building air-raid shelters on the ground in Helsinki to come to a standstill. The doors of air-raid shelters in northern Finland, which had been closed for more than a year, have now been reopened.</p>
<p>Sweden Decides to Maintain Neutrality: Closes Border Traffic</p>
<p>Havas, Switzerland, 22nd - According to a correspondent for the "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" stationed in Stockholm, the current situation in Finland will not affect Sweden, but if war breaks out in Finland, the situation will be different. Fortunately, the Swedish people have reached a consensus and will be able to continue to maintain a neutral policy. The necessary preparations have been completed here during the past week. The Swedish Parliament is scheduled to hold a secret meeting next Friday, but it is believed that there will be no changes in its foreign policy.</p>
<p>Reuters, Stockholm, 22nd - The Swedish Cabinet convened an emergency meeting this morning. The King returned to the palace from his country villa at 10:15 AM and received Foreign Minister Gunther and Prime Minister Hansson fifteen minutes later, dispersing at 11:20 AM. Swedish Radio issued instructions to ships sailing at sea, stating that in view of the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, they must immediately return to Swedish ports.</p>
<h3>Key Points of the German Note to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 22nd - The key points of the German Foreign Ministry's note to the Soviet government are as follows: (1) It details how the German government attempted to set aside the different concepts of National Socialism and Communism, which advocated opposing views, and decided to seek a way to maintain a balance of interests. (2) The Soviet government's willingness to conclude a friendship treaty with Germany clearly proves that the Soviet government sympathizes with the German government, that is to say, the Soviet government should be able to understand the German government's intentions and not spread communism in Germany. (3) After signing the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, the German government's policy towards the Soviet Union underwent a fundamental change and completely adopted a friendly attitude, hoping that the Soviet Union would adopt the same policy towards Germany. How could one have known that human hearts are unpredictable and things go against one's wishes? (4) Finally, the German government presented various pieces of evidence to clarify the Soviet Union's conspiracy against Germany, especially in Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and other countries. The Communist Party had distributed various anti-German leaflets, and the evidence was irrefutable and could not be concealed.</p>
<h3>German Foreign Minister Receives Envoys from Various Countries</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 21st - This morning, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop received the ambassadors of Italy, Japan, Turkey, and Spain, as well as the envoys of Hungary, Bulgaria, Finland, Romania, Sweden, Slovakia, and Croatia, totaling eleven countries. These eleven countries are either allies of Germany or have close diplomatic ties with Germany. Therefore, after the German government decided on measures to be taken against the Soviet Union, it immediately notified the resident envoys of these countries.</p>
<h3>Turkey Convenes Emergency Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>International News Agency, New York, 22nd - The National Broadcasting Company stated yesterday that, according to a Rome wireless report, Turkish President İsmet İnönü convened an important cabinet meeting in Istanbul on Sunday.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 22nd - It was learned here yesterday from a broadcast from Ankara that the Turkish parliament has approved the extension of military alert on its western border for three months.</p>
<h3>Chinese People Determined to Strive, All of America Extends Sympathy - US Ambassador Gauss's Interview with Reporters</h3>
<p>Chongqing - When the newly appointed US Ambassador to China, Gauss, met with Chinese news reporters, he remained strictly silent regarding the recent developments in the international situation. When asked about US-Japan relations, he stated that the future developments are difficult to predict, but the attitude of the United States can be clearly understood through its actions. Gauss greatly praised the Chinese people for maintaining a cheerful spirit despite suffering various wartime hardships. He continued by saying that the US government and people, in light of the resolute and tireless efforts of the Chinese people, naturally extend their sympathy. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Instructions at the National Financial Conference - Establishing a Financial and Economic Foundation, Implementing Grain and Land Policies</h3>
<p>The full text of Chairman Chiang's instructions at the Financial Conference is as follows: Today, the second National Financial Conference and Pacification Conference are holding their opening ceremony. The Chairman's instructions just now explained the significance and importance of the conference's tasks, which everyone must thoroughly understand. Today, I will add a few more points to what the Chairman said and offer them to my fellow comrades. Originally, the nature of the Pacification Conference and the Financial Conference have many things in common, that is, to coordinate the military and political aspects of the rear to jointly consolidate the foundation of resistance and national construction. Therefore, my opinions on several fundamental issues at the National Financial Conference should also be carefully listened to by all comrades attending the Pacification Conference, so that we can help each other practically and proceed in a unified manner. Since the establishment of the National Government, two National Financial Conferences have been held. The first conference was to abolish likin throughout the country, and the second conference was to abolish various exorbitant taxes and levies in various places. The implementation of these two major events eliminated the heavy obstacles to the national economy and allowed people's livelihood to develop freely. They were all major reforms related to the country. However, the achievements of these two conferences were still of a passive nature, focusing on the aspect of (eliminating malpractices). Today, the second National Financial Conference that we are holding is the same as the past two conferences in its task, but it is entirely about carrying out</p>
<h3>Active Construction</h3>
<p>work. It is to build a sound national finance during the resistance and construction period, and to establish a permanent foundation for national finance. In other words, it is necessary to comprehensively plan and rationally allocate national finance, so that the construction undertakings of various provinces, especially economic construction, will not have the phenomenon of uneven distribution of wealth and poverty, but will be able to develop universally and balancedly. In order to achieve this goal, the government must first determine two goals: (1) To balance national financial revenue and expenditure, (2) To equalize the burden on the people. These two points are the basic policies of modern government resistance and construction, so everyone must recognize that this financial conference is by no means comparable to an ordinary conference. Its task is not only to implement the transfer of land tax to the central government and establish a financial revenue and expenditure system. Although these two matters are the main plans of this conference, in terms of the entire spirit and fundamental nature that the conference wants to implement, this conference is really the most important conference related to the national economy and people's livelihood and the future of national construction. When we think back to the hardships and difficulties that the national government has gone through in finance since its establishment, how much we have known, and now that the resistance and construction have been going on for four years, not only is there no dangerous phenomenon in national finance, both internally and externally, but it is becoming sounder and more stable day by day. From this, on the one hand, we can see the greatness of the latent power of our national economy, and on the other hand, it is enough to show the soundness and correctness of the policies implemented by our government, and the difficulty and preciousness of the achievements obtained through past hard struggles. Everyone must know that we are now engaged in a protracted resistance and construction, and the reason why finance can still be maintained to such an extent is due to the success of the legal tender policy. What is this legal tender policy? Today, it may as well be stated clearly that it is the</p>
<h3>Monetary Revolution</h3>
<p>the success of. When I inspected various provinces and entered Sichuan in the 24th year of the Republic of China, I saw the complexity of the currency system in various places, which was really frightening. Therefore, I studied the pain of the people and the darkness of society. The crux of all kinds of malpractices lies in this. Furthermore, I thought that if the country were to have a war with foreign countries, the financial economy would be even more chaotic and would directly control the country's lifeline. Therefore, if our country wants to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood and be able to cope with all internal and external difficulties, the only important task is to unify the currency system in finance and economy, so that legal tender can circulate smoothly throughout the country, so that the people will not suffer the pain of exploitation in the past, and the wartime will not be affected by the chaos of finance and finance. Therefore, when I arrived in Sichuan at that time, in addition to the implementation of the fire prevention zone system in Sichuan, I also decided that the central government must implement the policy of unifying the national currency system. This policy of unifying the currency system is something that everyone has considered very difficult and impossible to achieve for decades, and it is also something that any financier in the past dared not do. Our financial authorities seem to be able to follow the government's policy and the principle of the Prime Minister's currency revolution, not avoiding complaints, and working hard despite all kinds of difficulties. Later, they were able to completely complete it. Therefore, our resistance and construction can achieve such results today. When our legal tender policy was first implemented, the financial and financial circles in the country and various commercial banks at that time believed that the unification of the currency system would cause a great loss to their interests. Before it started, there were many discussions expressing complete opposition, and many rumors and slanders occurred, which almost caused the national market to shake. After the government issued an order and thoroughly implemented it, not only did the financial circles and various banks and money houses not suffer any losses, but all their businesses suddenly advanced, and commerce was exceptionally developed. All public and private economic undertakings could</p>
<h3>Thrive</h3>
<p>If we compare the situation before and after the unification of the currency system, the development of all economic industries in our country after the implementation of the currency system has really felt like a thousand miles a day. This is a very obvious fact in recent years. We are now approaching the glorious victory of resistance and construction, which has already been decided. It is also approaching the time when we have to overcome and break through all the final difficulties. We must think back to all the dangers and difficulties we have experienced in the past, as well as the unification of China's currency system in the 24th year of the Republic of China, which could not be unified for hundreds of years, and the bad habits that could not be broken in the past, so that legal tender could be implemented without hindrance, and finance could be developed as much as possible. The most difficult and chaotic big problem was completely solved. What financial problems cannot be solved in the future? However, this is entirely the progress of the times, and the progress of the knowledge and thinking of our people across the country, as well as the ability of the financial and industrial circles across the country to understand the big picture, understand the righteousness, and unanimously support the government's policies, not hesitating to sacrifice the interests of the small self, and to contribute to the country, so that we can get such an effect of today's resistance and construction. From the experience of unifying the currency system, we can get a definition, that is, "Everything that is beneficial to the country and the people must also be beneficial to the individual." Therefore, the government must seek to implement any policy that is beneficial to the country and the people to the end, no matter what difficulties it encounters, and there is no reason why this policy will not succeed. We must now establish a financial foundation for national construction, and we must transfer the national land tax to the central government for management. The national financial revenue and expenditure system and the local autonomous financial revenue and expenditure system must also be clearly divided. Only then can the country become a modern country. The former land tax will be explained later. For the latter financial revenue and expenditure system, if it can be established separately, on the one hand, the expenses of local autonomous undertakings can be guaranteed, and the new county system can be completed as scheduled, so that it will not be like the past in name only. On the other hand, after the national financial revenue and expenditure system is established, not only the central finance</p>
<h3>Will Be Solid From Now On</h3>
<p>Moreover, all construction undertakings in various provinces, especially national defense and economic undertakings, can also be effectively promoted, and there will never be any unhealthy and deformed situations like in the past, so that the remote and sparsely populated areas have no construction power for important national defense undertakings, which is equivalent to a desert. Therefore, these two things are the basic important tasks of the entire national economy and people's livelihood at present, not only related to finance. Whether it is the comrades attending this financial conference and economic conference, as well as the central and local responsible officials, we must recognize that this is not only a problem related to the national financial economy, but also a problem related to the survival of our farmers, workers, merchants, students, and people from all walks of life. Therefore, everyone must work together to implement today's financial policies to the end. Only in this way can the resistance and construction war be won, and the country can be built. Originally, the war and the construction of the country were one and the same thing. Because we want to build the country, we must fight, and the war is precisely for the sake of building the country. Therefore, at the beginning of the war, the foundation for building the country had already been laid, and during the war, we must work hard to build the country. During this period, because we want to establish the foundation for building the country, we have proposed three concrete policies and tried our best to ensure that they are implemented. The first is to implement the new system and promote local autonomy. If the new county system can be implemented effectively in accordance with the prescribed plan and goals, and local autonomy can be effective, the national politics will have a solid foundation, and all national construction work can be completely successful. The second is financial revenue and expenditure.</p>
<h3>Should Seek Balance</h3>
<p>The burden on the people must be equal. The former requires the government to be able to abide by the resolution and the budget to implement the principle of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, which is not difficult to do. As for the latter, it is actually the most important. During this period of resistance and construction, we must not allow the rich people not to pay, but instead allow the poor masses to bear the expenses of the country. This is the most unfair thing. In the future, we must effectively correct it to seek the average burden of the people. However, if we want to average the national burden, we must first rectify the national taxation. To rectify the national taxation, the central government must formulate an entire plan and implement it in a unified manner in order to achieve this goal. The third is to implement the Prime Minister's land and food policies. Originally, in the Prime Minister's will, regarding the construction of national finance and economic undertakings, the most important tasks during the revolutionary period were three: (1) To implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, we must implement the "Monetary Revolution," which is to unify the currency system. (2) We must strictly implement "food management" at all times, whether in peacetime or wartime, and set up a special food administration. If the country cannot manage food, then the people's food and military food will have no foundation. In this way, the country can never become a modern country.</p>

<h3>Allied Forces Surround on Three Sides, Damascus Finally Falls - British Forces in the North Advance Towards Palmyra - Syrian War May End Soon</h3>
<p>United Press, 12th - It was announced here late yesterday evening that Allied forces have entered Damascus.</p>
<p>Havase News Agency, Beirut, 21st - An official communique was recently released stating: (1) Our army has been pressured by enemy forces. In order to avoid war on the outskirts of the city, it has withdrawn from the city of Damascus to new positions outside the city to continue fighting today. (2) Enemy motorized units that have invaded the Syrian state from Iraq are now advancing towards the city of Palmyra.</p>
<p>Reuters, Jerusalem, 22nd - According to news from Beirut, the Vichy forces under the command of General Dentz have retreated to new positions north of Damascus.</p>
<p>Havase News Agency, Vichy, 21st - Regarding the French army's withdrawal from the city of Damascus, no detailed report has been received here. It is heard that the French General Staff was originally worried that the defenders' retreat route would be cut off and the city might be completely surrounded. Since the British army repeatedly failed to attack Damascus, it adopted a new strategy, implementing an encirclement offensive on the east, west, and south sides, and infiltrating a small number of troops into the city. However, as enemy reinforcements continued to arrive, the situation became increasingly dangerous, and the British artillery outside the city resumed shelling the city, causing severe damage to the Mohajreen New District in the west of the city. Under these circumstances, the defenders in the city had to move to new positions outside the city to continue the protest in order to avoid widespread death and destruction.</p>
<p>Reuters, Floriano, 22nd - Free French leader General Tegol met with a Reuters reporter last night, saying that the fall of Damascus will definitely bring the Vichy army's resistance in Syria to a swift end. General Tegol placed a large map of Syria in front of him, saying that the Free French entered Damascus at 3:00 AM, and although the British army has not yet entered the city, the victory of the French relies heavily on the help of the British army.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 22nd - The news from Beirut that the central army has taken Damascus has now been confirmed by the official venue. According to reports from scouts and confessions from prisoners of war, Syrian Affairs Officer General Dentz has used all of his forces for the rear of the battlefield and has no reserves. As a result, the Syrian war is expected to end soon.</p>

<h3>Britain Issues Ultimatum to French East Africa - Demanding to Join the Free French Forces - Otherwise, an Imminent Blockade Will Be Implemented - Negotiations on Using Railways Have Reached a Stalemate</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd - According to Vichy Radio, General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Middle East, has issued a letter of ultimatum to French Somaliland, and France has protested to Britain and notified the United States. British pressure on French Somaliland continues to increase, and this letter of ultimatum has finally been issued. Negotiations on the British use of the railway from Addis Ababa to Djibouti have reached a stalemate because General Wavell's conditions are unacceptable to the French. The above-mentioned letter of ultimatum has not yet been confirmed in London.</p>
<p>Lubei News Agency, London, 22nd - It is now learned that General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Middle East, has asked the governors of Djibouti and French Somaliland to state their position and immediately join the Free French Forces or publicly announce that they do not approve of the pro-German policies of Syria. If they do not negotiate on this proposal, General Wavell is willing to allow women and children to withdraw from Djibouti and is willing to provide milk and necessary food until the evacuation of women and children is completed. Djibouti is a seaport with a railway connecting it to Addis Ababa, the capital of the 9,000-square-mile French colony at the mouth of the Red Sea, with a population of 15,000 before the war. According to Vichy news, General Wavell issued a letter of ultimatum demanding that French Somaliland join the Free French Forces, otherwise the French colony will be in danger of famine due to the implementation of a strict blockade. The Vichy government has ordered French Ambassador to Spain Walter to deliver a protest to British Ambassador to Spain Hall.</p>
<p>Content of France's Protest to Britain</p>
<p>Havase News Agency, Vichy, 21st - French Ambassador to Spain Pittry visited British Ambassador Sir Hall today and personally delivered a note from the French government, protesting against Britain's threat to starve the people of French Somaliland in East Africa. The French government also instructed Ambassador to the United States Hai Henry to deliver the same note to the US government, urging it to pay attention. The full text of the note is translated as follows: (1) General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Near East Forces, on June 9, 1941, notified the French authorities in writing on behalf of the British government that if French Somaliland does not return to the Tegol faction, Britain will intensify its blockade and starve all the residents of the area. On the contrary, if it can be accepted with pleasure, Britain will take various steps to transport food to maintain the people's food and guarantee its economic interests. This document is almost equivalent to an ultimatum. (2) This kind of ultimatum is equivalent to sentencing all the residents in a certain territory to death by starvation in order to force them to rebel against their motherland. There is almost no precedent for this kind of means in human history. However, the people of French Somaliland have expressed to the military and political authorities their decision to be loyal to the Petain government. All kinds of rumors from the outside world are not true. French Somaliland has been surrounded by British troops and the Tegol faction for two months. Only five of the more than 2,000 French expatriates have crossed the border to join the Tegol faction. (3) The British authorities have been implementing blockade measures against French Somaliland since September 1940, and have been quite effective. For example, in March and April of this year, several children starved to death due to lack of food. The people of French Somaliland, in dire straits, only rose up to resist this inhumane measure, and once issued an earnest appeal to the British government and the International Red Cross representative in Somaliland. (4) The French government has allowed other countries to transport food through the French port of Djibouti under the auspices of the International Red Cross to Abyssinia to relieve the general sick and injured adults and children. This attitude is not biased towards any of the belligerent countries, but rather the French in this painful period still want to express their inherent humanitarianism and selfless spirit. This is in stark contrast to the attitude of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 22nd: According to the communiqué, the British Air Force fiercely attacked the German Air Force in northern France during the day yesterday, destroying 28 of their fighters, while only four British planes were lost. The British are now using new-style Spitfire and Hurricane aircraft, which rise faster, fly higher, and have greater firepower than older models. Yesterday was the fifth consecutive day of attacks on northern France during the day. The attacks were carried out in two waves, and the scale of power and the intensity of the attacks were unprecedented since the British Air Force adopted an offensive stance. Both waves of British aircraft broke through the German fighter formations and severely bombed the German-occupied airfields. In the first wave, at least eleven enemy aircraft were destroyed in the morning. Three hours later, the second wave of the British Air Force moved out and destroyed even more enemy aircraft, resulting in a battle result of destroying 28 enemy aircraft in one day. This is the greatest harvest since the British air war last autumn. As a result, the German aircraft lost a total of 65 aircraft in the past five days.</p>
<p>Haidisha, Berlin, 22nd: According to the official statement, British aircraft attempted to invade the German-occupied area yesterday, losing a total of 26 aircraft, 24 of which were shot down by German aircraft, and two were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. Five German planes are missing.</p>

The main targets were Cologne and Dusseldorf. The docks of Dunkirk and Boulogne were also bombed by British aircraft.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd: Last night, the intelligence department of the Ministry of Aviation reported that the American-made single-seat Tomahawk fighter aircraft are unique in their lift-off and striking power, and have achieved remarkable results in the recent fierce air battles in the Middle East. It is now known that British Empire pilots have used this type of aircraft to defend the British fleet outside Syria to prevent German dive bombers from attacking, and to resist German and Italian aircraft attacking in the Near East. The Ministry of Aviation added a comment saying that since this latest type of fighter aircraft has gradually appeared in increasing numbers, it has shot down many of the best German and Italian aircraft. This not only shows that the material assistance provided by the United States to Britain and the Allies continues to develop, but also shows that Britain's sky power in the Middle East is increasing day by day. All those who fly this aircraft praise its ease of use and its ability to safely defeat German and Italian aircraft.</p>

<h3>US Secretary of the Army Announces the Formation of Army Air Corps, Appoints a Commander to Command Independently, The Department of the Army Also Asks Congress to Approve Extending the Enlistment Period of the National Defense Force by One Year</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 22nd: Secretary of the Army Colonel Stimson announced yesterday that he had ordered the reorganization of the activities of the United States Army Air Corps into an independent agency called the "Army Air Corps." This agency will combine the general headquarters into one under the name of "Army Air Corps" and will be commanded independently by an officer. This new air force command will only be controlled by the Chief of Staff. It is reported that Major General Arnold may be the commander of this new agency. Colonel Stimson strongly opposed merging the air forces of the Navy, Army, and Marine Corps to form an absolutely independent Air Force Department. He said, "With this change, whether it is assisting ground troops in combat or establishing a long-range and powerful force such as special task forces, it will have the effect of creating unified command and can assist naval, land, and air operations."</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 22nd: Secretary of the Army Stimson announced that a unified organization called the Army Air Corps has now been established. All training, supplies, and other matters will be under the control of a senior air force officer who will be responsible only to the Army Chief of Staff.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 22nd: The US Department of the Army has submitted a request to President Roosevelt to ask Congress to approve the extension of the enlistment period of the National Guard to one year beyond the existing one year. When the Department of the Army announced this matter, it said that legislation must be enacted to extend the enlistment period of the National Guard. As for the final decision, it is a matter of public policy that should be handled by the President and Congress. If Congress does not agree, the first batch of 290,000 people in the current National Guard will be demobilized on September 16.</p>
<h3>Full Text of Hitler's Declaration</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 22nd: German Führer Hitler's declaration of war on the Soviet Union was read by Propaganda Minister Goebbels at 3:30 this morning. The content roughly stated that the Soviet Union had been betraying the treaty of friendship signed with Germany, and the Soviet Union had been in contact with Britain to promote policies against Germany and the whole of Europe for more than a year. The Soviet Union is now gathering a large army of 160 divisions on Germany's eastern border. In order to prevent this military action, Germany is forced to decide to form an alliance with Finland and Romania, placing the future destiny of Germany and its people in the hands of our soldiers. The full text of the Führer's declaration is as follows:</p>
<p>German people, National Socialist comrades, I have carefully maintained silence for several months. At this moment, I can speak frankly. When Germany received Britain's declaration of war on September 23, 1939, Britain repeatedly attempted to obstruct the unity of Europe and waged war against the strongest country on the European continent. In the summer of 1939, Britain began to use its old tricks from the World War, attempting to destroy Germany through an encirclement policy, creating various lies, claiming that various nations had been threatened, and providing promises of assistance and guarantees to induce them to fight against Germany. The situation was the same as during the World War. From May to August 1939, Britain continuously broadcast promises to the world, stating that Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Finland, Bessarabia, Ukraine, etc. had all been directly threatened by Germany. Some of these countries were deceived and accepted Britain's guarantee promises, joining the front line of encircling Germany. Under this situation, I shouldered the heavy responsibility of the history of the German nation, using facts to protect the countries deceived by the British lies, and first stabilize the position of the eastern border, limited to the scope of our interests. The German people have never harbored hostility towards the Soviet people. However, the Jewish Bolshevik rulers in Moscow have for more than 20 years always regarded inciting the flames of war in Germany and even the whole of Europe as their mission. Germany has never attempted to import National Socialism into the Soviet Union. However, the Bolshevik rulers in Moscow have always wanted to control Germany and other European nations by political means and force. The result of this activity of the Soviet Union only plunged various countries into chaos and famine. On the contrary, in the recent 20 years, I have strived to create a new social order for Germany through productive work. The purpose of this national economic and social policy is to create a true people's society and eliminate class differences. In August 1939, in extremely difficult circumstances, I sent the Foreign Minister to Moscow, striving to counter Britain's policy of encircling Germany. At that time, Germany solemnly assured Moscow that the proposed territories and countries, except for Lithuania, were all outside the scope of Germany's political interests, and signed a special agreement with it on the condition that Britain incited Poland to fight against Germany. The content of this agreement was quite harsh on the Germans in the countries concerned. As many as 500,000 German men and women were forced to leave their homes and return to their country overnight. However, thousands of Germans mysteriously disappeared, and their whereabouts were unknown. Among them, 160 were citizens of Germany. I had to keep silent about all of this at the time, and hoped that I could finally alleviate this tension. However, when our army entered Poland, the Soviet rulers suddenly violated the treaty and made a demand for Lithuania. Germany never intended to occupy Lithuania, nor did it make this request to the Lithuanian government. On the contrary, Germany refused the application of the then government of Lithuania for German troops to enter Lithuania. Even so, I still agreed to the new request of the Soviet Union. After the victory in the Polish campaign, I made peace proposals to the Western countries, but they were ultimately unsuccessful due to international conspiracies and the refusal of Jewish war agitators. At that time, Britain held out the hope of mobilizing a European alliance to deal with Germany, including the Balkans and the Soviet Union. The British government later decided to send Cripps as ambassador to the Soviet Union, going to Moscow to fulfill the instruction to promote British-Soviet relations and make the Soviet Union produce pro-British tendencies. The effect gradually became apparent in the autumn of 1939 and the spring of 1940. The Soviet Union forcibly conquered Finland and the Baltic countries, its motives were hypocritical and ridiculous, but I still maintained silence. However, the figures in the Kremlin went a step further. In the spring of 1940, Germany complied with the provisions of the so-called treaty of friendship and withdrew the German army from the eastern border. At that time, the Soviet Union had begun to concentrate its troops. This measure can be regarded as a deliberate threat to Germany. According to Molotov, in the spring of 1940, there were 22 Soviet divisions in the Baltic countries. Although the Soviet government concealed its meaning, its role in demonstrating against Germany was self-evident. After the German army defeated the resistance of Britain and France on the western front on May 10, 1940, the Soviet army continued to expand its operations on the eastern front. After August 1940, I considered that the eastern border could no longer be left empty and undefended. Later, the Soviet Foreign Commissar for Foreign Affairs asked Germany the following four questions:</p>
<p>(1) Molotov asked, if the Soviet Union attacks Romania, will Germany's guarantee to Romania also be directed against the Soviet Union? I replied that Germany's guarantee to Romania is of a general nature and we will abide by it unconditionally. The Soviet Union has declared to us that the Soviet Union has no other interests in Romania except for Bessarabia, so the occupation of Northern Bukovina has already violated this guarantee. Therefore, I believe that the Soviet Union cannot have any other intentions towards Romania.</p>
<p>(2) Molotov asked, the Soviet Union still feels threatened by Finland, so it has decided that it can no longer tolerate it. Does Germany have no intention of helping Finland? Will it withdraw its troops passing through Kirkenes? I replied that Germany still has absolutely no political interests in Finland. However, the German government believes that it cannot tolerate the Soviet Union's launching an attack on the small nation of Finland. We can never believe that Finland can threaten the Soviet Union, nor do we want the Baltic Sea to cause a war.</p>
<p>(3) Molotov asked, can Germany agree to the Soviet Union providing guarantees to Bulgaria and sending Soviet troops to Bulgaria for protection? Molotov also made it clear that he had no intention of abolishing the Bulgarian King. I replied that Bulgaria is an autonomous country. I don't know if Bulgaria has ever asked the Soviet Union to provide guarantees, like Romania to Germany, but I am willing to discuss this matter with my allies.</p>
<p>(4) Molotov asked, the Soviet Union needs the convenience of free passage through the Dardanelles and requires the occupation of important bases in the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus. Can Germany agree? I replied that Germany is willing to agree to amend the Mondreux Treaty at any time, with the premise of benefiting the Black Sea countries, but cannot agree to the Soviet Union occupying bases in the straits. My attitude on this is based on the position of a responsible leader of Germany and a representative of European culture. The result was to increase the Soviet Union's anti-German activities, immediately starting conspiracy activities against Romania and Bulgaria. A coup occurred in Romania, attempting to overthrow Antonescu's government. At that time, I still thought it was best to keep silence. However, after the Soviet Union's failure this time, it supplemented its concentrated troops on the border, threatening Germany. The Yugoslav campaign was evidence of British-Soviet cooperation. When I was striving to appease the Balkan countries and invited Yugoslavia to join the Tripartite Pact, Britain and the Soviet Union launched a coup in Yugoslavia overnight. The influence of the Soviet Union on this Serbian coup was greater than that of Britain. We still kept silent about it. The Soviet leaders went a step further. The German government has now obtained evidence of the Soviet Union inciting Serbia to fight against Germany. The Soviet Union had guaranteed to transport munitions, weapons, aircraft, etc. from Thessaloniki to Serbia. This happened when I was urging Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka to ease tensions with the Soviet Union. After our army quickly occupied Thessaloniki, the Soviet-Anglo-Saxon conspiracy failed. At this point, Moscow had destroyed the German-Soviet treaty of friendship and revealed its contents. At this moment, I can no longer stand by and remain silent, becoming a sinner of the German people. The Soviet Union has gathered 160 divisions on Germany's eastern border, and violations of the border have occurred repeatedly. From the night of June 17 to the 18th, Soviet sentries were shelled from German territory, so it is necessary to take action to resist the Bolsheviks.</p>
<p>German people, our soldiers are now stationed with Finnish soldiers along the Arctic Ocean, protecting Finnish territory. From Prussia to the Black Sea, German troops are jointly defending with Romanian troops. This front line is not only protecting one country, but is protecting the security of the whole of Europe. Therefore, I have now decided to place the future destiny of Germany and its people in the hands of the soldiers. God bless me and help me fight. June 22, 1941, Hitler (signed)</p>

<h3>Great Contribution of the Chinese Transportation Industry: Successful Testing of Tung Oil Cars, Perfected After Several Studies and Transformations, Fuel Consumption of Only 24 Cents Per Kilometer, Transportation Industry Authority Comes to Shanghai to Talk About the Test Drive in Chongqing</h3>
<p>The successful testing of domestically produced tung oil cars in the capital Chongqing on the 4th of this month has been reported in this newspaper. However, the transportation industry and machinery experts are quite concerned about the manufacturing process. Yesterday, an authority in the transportation industry returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong, saying that when he was in Chongqing, he personally participated in the grand ceremony of the tung oil car test drive. It is said that Mr. Zhang Shigan, who participated in the Beijing-Yunnan Highway tour group with vegetable oil cars, is the chief engineer of the China Motor Manufacturing Company. Recently, he drove the tung oil car successfully manufactured by the company to Chongqing, invited people from all walks of life, and went to the capital to test the car. From Hualongqiao to Beipei Hot Springs, a distance of 60 kilometers, the round trip took one and a half hours. Tung oil was used entirely. When climbing Laoyingyan, the speed was 30 kilometers in third gear. In other places, it was 40 kilometers or more, which was no different from driving a gasoline car.</p>
<p>Burn Vegetable Oil to Drive Cars</p>
<p>The China Motor Manufacturing Company imitated the German Benz diesel engine and used vegetable oil to drive the car. When the company was founded in 1937, it began to study it, and fortunately it succeeded in more than a year. In the spring of 1938, the Executive Yuan held a Beijing-Yunnan Highway tour group, and the company sent a car to participate. From Shanghai to Kunming, and then from Kunming via Guizhou and Guangdong to Shanghai, it performed a total of 14,000 kilometers. The results were excellent. The car did not carry fuel with it, and completely used the vegetable oil produced locally by the construction bureaus of various provinces, such as cottonseed oil in Shanghai, peanut oil in Nanjing, rapeseed oil in Anhui Province, sesame oil and rapeseed oil in Jiangxi Province, vegetable oil and soybean oil in Hubei Province, tung oil and opium oil in Guizhou Province, and rapeseed oil in Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>Tung Oil Driving Laid the Foundation Early</p>
<p>When tung oil was first used in Guizhou Province, the results were exceptionally good, and the power was very great, ranking first among all oils. However, because the car was driven for a little longer, obstacles occurred inside the machine, and it often stopped for repairs on the way. The tung oil was very viscous, the oil quality easily changed, the oil surface formed a skin, and the oil pipe was blocked, causing the components to not move freely. However, although the results were not satisfactory, the fact that tung oil can drive cars was indeed laid its foundation at that time.</p>
<p>Research and Improvement Repeatedly Failed</p>
<p>Mr. Zeng Yangfu, the chairman of the company, believed that tung oil driving was the only way to fuel oil during wartime. Since he had already found a clue, he should obtain its results. So he encouraged Zhang to conduct further research, and added many assistant chemical experts to assist in the test. At first, they started from the chemical aspect, using chemical drugs and materials to prevent oxidation, and infiltrating other thin oils into the tung oil, in order to prevent it from drying out and correct its viscosity. However, the result was too much carbon, and the cylinder was easily damaged, so it failed. Then, they reformed from the physical aspect, adding external heat to the tung oil tank to reduce its viscosity, and switching to diesel oil when parking the car to prevent the oil pipe from forming a skin. However, this method increased the number of parts, the procedures were complicated, and management was difficult, which was definitely not something that ordinary drivers could handle, so it was not considered successful.</p>
<p>Final Decision: Fundamental Transformation</p>
<p>The final decision was to fundamentally transform the manufacturing work based on the performance of tung oil itself. The heat unit contained in tung oil and diesel oil was compared with each other to determine the volume of the pre-combustion chamber, so that it fully conformed to the application of tung oil. This was to enable tung oil to fully gasify in the pre-combustion chamber, to be completely burned in the cylinder, leaving no carbon residue, so the cylinder was extremely clean, and obstacles were not easy to occur in the parts. The pressure during tung oil injection was also increased to resist the thick viscosity of tung oil, so that tung oil could be completely turned into a thin mist when sprayed out, so that it could be in close contact with high-pressure air and fully gasify in the pre-combustion chamber, and the injection time was advanced to correct the shortcomings of the slow combustion of tung oil.</p>
<p>All Obstacles Removed, Test Successful</p>
<p>The ventilation points of each roadway were more tightly sealed, so that air could not come into contact with the tung oil, the oil surface could not change, and the oil pipe would not be blocked and obstacles would occur. Alcohol was used to start the car when it was cold, and there was no difficulty in starting. According to the above improvement methods, the company has conducted strict long-term tests on several new cars it manufactured, and the results are extremely satisfactory. The experiment of using domestically produced tung oil to replace imported gasoline and diesel oil to drive cars has been completely successful so far.</p>
<p>From Guiyang to Chongqing in 15 Hours</p>
<p>The engine of the car driven by Zhang to the capital this time was manufactured by the company itself based on the test results, so it is extremely suitable for using tung oil. The car departed from the company's Guilin branch to Chongqing, covering a distance of 1,200 kilometers, carrying 2.5 tons of goods, and using tung oil entirely. In terms of the machine, no obstacles occurred at all. The speed per hour was as high as 55 kilometers, and the average speed was 35 kilometers. It only took 15 hours from Guiyang to Haitangxi. Climbing mountains and crossing ridges was slightly slower than gasoline cars, but the ability was quite good, and all the slopes could be traveled smoothly, which was completely the same as when using diesel oil.</p>
<p>24 Kilometers Cost 6 Yuan</p>
<p>Tung oil is 15 gallons per catty. The market price in Guilin is 86 yuan per dan, and the price per gallon is 6 yuan. It can travel 24 kilometers per gallon on flat ground, so the fuel cost per kilometer is only 24 cents. This was determined during the Guiyang-Chongqing trip, and the average consumption was 18.3 kilometers per gallon. All tung oil was purchased from oil shops in the city and was not refined. The refined oil evaporates and loses its power, the horsepower is reduced, and the amount used is more, so the results are not good. The purchased oil is filtered with native cloth before it can be added to the car's oil tank for use. The filtering method is the same as that used by tofu shops to filter soybean juice.</p>
<p>Daqu Maotai is Burned to Start</p>
<p>When starting a cold car, use a little alcohol. Daqu Maotai can also be used. To clean the parts, use boiling water, and the oil stains will be removed immediately. To store tung oil, use bamboo baskets. Therefore, the fuel used by the company's demonstration car this time and its treatment method are all the most commonly used old methods in our country, which can be called completely domestic products.</p>
<h3>Lugouqiao Battle Fourth Anniversary: All Circles are Preparing for Commemoration, Strict Precautions on Both Boundary Sides</h3>
<p>The fourth anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident on July 7th is approaching. Various circles in this city, due to the special circumstances, will not hold any commemorative ceremonies. However, they have already planned and are actively preparing for commemorative measures for this great historical day. According to a reporter from the Daguang News Agency, the police authorities of the two concession areas in this city, considering the current tense situation and the important position of Shanghai, will implement emergency precautions ahead of time to maintain the security of the concessions and ensure public peace. The preventive measures will be stricter than in the past to prevent accidents. It is said that any gatherings or parades will be prohibited for a week before and after the anniversary to prevent unscrupulous elements from taking the opportunity to cause trouble.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers in Shengze Area Frequently Attacked</h3>
<p>According to a person from Wujiang, the Shengze area in Wujiang County, located between the Sujia Road and Taihu Lake, is a strategic location. Usually, twenty or thirty Japanese soldiers are stationed there. However, the Loyal Patriotic Army scattered in the area frequently launches attacks, causing the Japanese soldiers to be in a state of panic. One week ago, late at night, a unit of the Loyal Patriotic Army took advantage of the Japanese soldiers' unpreparedness and stormed into the town with lightning speed. The Japanese soldiers were caught off guard and suffered heavy losses. When the Japanese soldiers in Wujiang County City heard the news, they urgently dispatched a large force. However, the Chinese army had already withdrawn safely.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Trade Surplus in May Exceeds 100 Million Yuan, Transportation Still Maintains Original Status, and Essential Supplies are Sufficient</h3>
<p>Since the expansion of the European war, transportation has become difficult, and the trade of all countries in the world has been affected. This city is one of the largest international cities, and the Pacific sea route can still maintain its original status. Therefore, this city's trade with foreign countries has not only not been adversely affected but has instead become increasingly prosperous. According to the Jianghai Customs, Shanghai's foreign trade in May had an import value of 26,098,944 Customs Gold Units, equivalent to 70,649,841 legal tender yuan, and an export value of 197,688,592 yuan. The resulting trade surplus amounted to 127,038,751 yuan, a record rarely seen in the city's history.</p>
<p>Food Still Occupies the Top Spot in Imports</p>
<p>Among the goods imported in May, food still occupied the top spot, with a total value of 8,998,640 Customs Gold Units, an increase compared to the previous month. Among them, foreign rice accounted for the largest share, with a total import of 555,971 metric tons in May, valued at 4,876,980 Customs Gold Units. Imports from Burma accounted for five-tenths, or 240,722 metric tons. Next was Annam with 217,721 metric tons, followed by Thailand with 89,982 metric tons. From January to May, Shanghai's import of foreign rice has reached 3,611,892 metric tons, indicating that there is absolutely no shortage of food for the city's residents.</p>
<p>Cotton and Oils Arrive in Shanghai in Large Quantities</p>
<p>Cotton ranked second in import volume, as Shanghai has always been a textile center. Its import value was 5,662,411 Customs Gold Units. Imports from India accounted for one-half of the total, and the quantity of American cotton was also considerable. Oil imports ranked third, with a value of 1,581,854 Customs Gold Units. The Dutch East Indies accounted for slightly less than one-half of the source, followed by the United States and other places. Gasoline alone reached 6,868,473 liters, equivalent to 223,649 Customs Gold Units. Diesel imports reached 8,460 tons, equivalent to 319,762 Customs Gold Units. It is evident that the city's fuel situation has not yet deteriorated.</p>
<p>Sugar Trade Suddenly Leaps Forward</p>
<p>Sugar, which used to have a small share in import volume, has now jumped to fourth place, with a total value of 1,158,067 Customs Gold Units. Six-tenths of it came from the Dutch East Indies. It is reported that the sudden increase in quantity is due to merchants fearing disputes in the South Pacific and placing large orders. Paper ranked fifth, with a value of 967,174 Customs Gold Units. Imports from the United States accounted for two-thirds, followed by Taiwan and other places. In addition to the above categories, goods with larger imports include chemicals and metals.</p>
<p>Metals are Transported Inland for Construction</p>
<p>As for export goods, textiles used to be the most numerous. However, in May, metal products jumped to the top, with a value of 29,063,189 yuan. Among them, iron accounted for the largest share. The largest export destination was the Guangdong leased territory (Kowloon), with a value of 10,398,908 yuan. It is said that it was transferred to free China for construction purposes. The next destinations were India, the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies, which is believed to be for military use. Textiles (including silk fabrics) ranked second in exports, with a value of 28,966,547 yuan. More than one-half was exported to the United States, followed by Japan and India.</p>
<p>Shanghai Cotton Fabrics Sell Well Abroad</p>
<p>Cotton fabrics ranked third in export value, with a value of 15,346,372 yuan. The Dutch East Indies was the largest export destination, followed by the United States, Hong Kong, and India. Textile products ranked fourth, with a value of 18,691,766 yuan. They were mostly exported to Hong Kong, India, and Annam. Animal products ranked fifth, with a value of 14,584,392 yuan. Three-quarters were exported to the United States, followed by Japan. In addition to the above categories, goods with larger exports included groceries and grains.</p>
<h3>Japanese Strictly Check Household Registration in Hongkou, Increase Number of Military Police Posts</h3>
<p>Since Japanese people in Hongkou and the areas beyond the boundaries of the road have been assassinated one after another, the Japanese side's investigation of residents in the area has become more stringent than before. According to a reporter from Pinghu News Agency, in the past week, two Japanese military police officers have been conducting door-to-door investigations of households in the Hongkou district, filling in the household's population, name, occupation, and other items on the forms they carry. At the same time, the number of Japanese military police posts in the Hongkou district has also increased, with each post increasing from one person to three or four people. The area around the Waibaidu Bridge is particularly noticeable. It is also learned that the Hongkou Citizens' Union also distributed household registration survey forms a week ago through the district's Baozhang and Jiazhang, ordering them to be filled out and guaranteed by each household. It is said that each household will have to pay a security fee of one yuan per month to cover the union's operating expenses.</p>
<h3>Twelve American Ships to Take Over the Far East Route, Voyage Kept Secret, Ships to Sail According to Schedule to Carry Passengers and Cargo, Schedule Could Be Arranged Within a Week</h3>
<p>After the American Maritime Commission requisitioned seven President liners belonging to the American President Lines as auxiliary naval vessels, the authorities of the President Lines in this area, in order to ensure the safety of maritime travel and prevent all possible accidents, will keep the voyage of the company's ships and the names of the ships sailing to America secret. Previously scheduled voyages have been canceled. This measure not only emulates the cautious steps taken by the Allied countries during the war but is also a necessary measure given the tense relations between the United States and Germany and Italy. Subsequent replenishment of new ship schedules has not been determined, so it is necessary to reschedule.</p>
<p>Adam's Round-the-World Voyage Cancelled</p>
<p>The company in this area has received a telegram from its headquarters stating that the twelve President liners dispatched to the Far East will sail to Shanghai according to schedule to carry cargo and passengers to replace the shortage caused by the requisition of seven ships. The itinerary of the President Adam's liner, which was originally scheduled to sail from the United States on July 24 for a round-the-world voyage to Shanghai, has also been canceled. The itinerary of the President Pierce liner will also be changed and has not yet been determined. However, as the ship is listed on the micro-name list, it may be necessary to keep it secret.</p>
<p>Twelve American Ships Regularly Sail to Shanghai</p>
<p>Of the twelve President liners newly dispatched to the Far East, the remaining ships, except for the President Van Buren liner and the President Polk liner, which are still docked at the shipyard and have not yet been completed, will be sailed here as soon as possible. Among them, the President Garfield and President Monroe liners are sister ships to the President Van Buren, President Polk, and President Jackson liners. Each has a load of 16,000 tons and was recently recommended for construction by the Maritime Commission. The remaining four President liners, the President Buchanan, President Johnson, President Taylor, and President Fillmore, are cargo ships. The other four President liners, the President Madison, President Grant, President Harrison, and President Taylor, are said to have originally belonged to the former Dollar Steamship Lines and have been idle for a long time. The company is now extensively repairing the old ships at the San Francisco shipyard to allow them to sail to the Far East as soon as possible and maintain the route.</p>
<p>Revised Schedule to be Announced Within a Week</p>
<p>It is learned that the company authorities have done their best to expedite the scheduling of the twelve ships in order to meet the needs of shipping. Although the company has not made a decisive decision on the ship's sailing date and route, the company authorities will announce it within a week. The company will also do its best to purchase and utilize the cargo space of military transports in order to supply merchants.</p>
<h3>Polish Representative Broadcasts: Continue the Struggle, Democratic Countries Must Cooperate Closely</h3>
<p>The League of Democratic Nations, initiated by Mr. Alexander, the head of the British Embassy Information Office in this city, makes broadcast speeches every Friday evening on XMHA radio. Last week's speaker was the Polish representative, who stated in brief: Germany disregarded the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and invaded Poland. The Soviet Union then followed suit and invaded our country's eastern border. We tried our best to resist, but due to the disparity in military strength, our country fell into the hands of the enemy. However, the people of our country, united from top to bottom, have not engaged in any acts of treason from beginning to end, which is truly a cause for self-consolation. At present, the Polish people are under the "new order," with tens of thousands of people being deprived of their property and their lives being destroyed. Those who have no home to return to are too numerous to count. Anyone who disobeys Nazi orders is killed or imprisoned. The so-called freedom and culture have long disappeared from Poland. Most countries in Europe are now under the iron heel of the Nazis. Hitler's former claims of peace, merely aimed at abolishing the Treaty of Versailles, have now been torn to shreds, and he is realizing his ambition to rule Europe. We must remember this. The democratic nations are now fighting for national freedom and respect for the democratic principles of individuals. We must cooperate closely to realize this belief. Poland and the Czech Republic have already completed the first step. After this, whether during wartime or after peace is achieved, we must advance and retreat together with the democratic countries. Our homeland has two: one is our own country, and the other is Great Britain. How should all the people of Poland intensify their struggle and efforts for their homeland?</p>
<h3>Crime Rate Decreased Last Week</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Municipal Police, the number of crimes committed has been declining month by month in recent months. Last week, a total of 326 criminal cases occurred in the Public Concession, a decrease of four cases compared to the previous week. 455 criminals were arrested, a decrease of eleven compared to the previous week. The security within the concession has been strengthened by the addition of the White Russian reserve team of the police force and the assistance of the American defense forces stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Rainy Season Has Arrived, Desperate to Get Rid of Stock, Rice Market Rumors are Alarmist, Current Situation is Unrelated to Rice Transport, Market Price is Difficult to Manipulate Due to Government Rice Intervention</h3>
<p>Since the general large-scale hoarders fabricated various rumors at the end of last week in an attempt to raise rice prices but failed, they are now spreading alarmist rumors, saying that the Shanghai Municipal Council has encountered difficulties in ordering foreign rice from Hong Kong, in an attempt to confuse market sentiment. Their intentions are truly hateful. Yesterday, the reporter paid a special visit to a certain gentleman close to the authorities and asked for his opinion. According to him:</p>
<p>Hoarders Constantly Think of Sabotage</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council began selling foreign rice on a widespread basis in this city, the general large-scale hoarders have constantly thought of sabotaging it. However, in order to thoroughly solve the city's food problem, the authorities are determined to overcome difficulties and resolutely implement it. Not only has it gained the support of the entire city's population, but all legitimate rice merchants have also cooperated sincerely with it, so that the city's rice prices can be suppressed. Recently, the market price has been difficult to fluctuate sharply, but the difference from the selling price of the Shanghai Municipal Council's foreign rice is limited, making it impossible for the general hoarders to hoard and manipulate prices, and they also feel it difficult to sell. The millions of bags of foreign rice they have hoarded in warehouses are prone to spoilage due to the arrival of the rainy season.</p>
<p>Attempt to Induce Blind Obedience</p>
<p>Based on the above situation, the general hoarders have no other way to think of than to create various alarmist rumors in the market in an attempt to induce the general blindly following people to buy in large quantities. As for the 280,000 bags of Hong Kong rice purchased by the Shanghai Municipal Council in the first phase, in addition to the 220,000 bags that have arrived one after another, the remaining 60,000 bags will definitely arrive in Shanghai within the month. The various grain stores have also already begun to order Hong Kong rice from the authorities in the second phase, and the quantity has reached more than 6,000 tons (that is, more than 60,000 bags). There is no limit to the quantity ordered, and the source will not be interrupted. Therefore, the rice market's situation is undoubtedly assured. Also, according to shipping circles, the Yong Sheng Wheel of the Japanese Heiwa Company arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday afternoon, carrying 10,000 bags of foreign rice.</p>

<h3>Clerk of Salt Industry Bank Shot and Killed by Gatekeeper, Argument Led to Shooting, Lu Peiwen Died, Perpetrator Fled</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a shooting occurred in the Beijing Road branch of the Salt Industry Bank, where a gatekeeper shot and killed the bank's deputy chief clerk. The perpetrator fled the scene afterward. Details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<p>Argument Leads to Shooting, Lu Shot Four Times</p>
<p>Lu Peiwen, 35, a native of Beiping and the deputy chief clerk of the Salt Industry Bank at 280 Beijing Road, had worked at the bank for many years. He was known for his diligence. He resided in the dormitory on the second floor of the bank. Yesterday, at 10:10 AM, Lu, being on a Sunday holiday, had nothing to do. He stepped out of the dormitory door and saw Meng Xianwu (26, a native of Beiping), the bank's gatekeeper, dressed in plain clothes. Because the gatekeeper was under his management, Lu went up to correct him, telling Meng that he should wear his uniform. Meng replied that it was Sunday and there was no need to wear the uniform, leading to an argument. The argument escalated. Unexpectedly, the young gatekeeper, in a fit of anger, disregarded the consequences and pulled out his service pistol, firing four shots at Lu. Lu was unable to defend himself against the sudden shooting and was hit in the chest, abdomen, and left temple. He immediately bled profusely and collapsed in a pool of blood. He barely had a breath left.</p>
<p>Dies in the Afternoon, Perpetrator Ardently Pursued</p>
<p>The perpetrator, Meng Xianwu, seeing that he had committed a major homicide, feared punishment and fled downstairs with his gun, disappearing without a trace. At the time, the people in the bank's dormitory had heard the gunshots and went out to investigate. Upon discovering the bloodshed, they reported it to the Central Police Station by telephone. A large group of detectives arrived and summoned an ambulance to take him to Tongren Hospital for medical treatment. However, Lu's injuries were critical and he had lost too much blood. He died at around 0:30 PM, and his body was sent to the coroner's office for examination. The police station immediately launched a rigorous pursuit of the perpetrator, Meng Xianwu, to arrest him and bring him to justice. It is said that Meng and Lu had some kind of discord in the past, with frequent arguments, leading to a long-standing animosity. This blood case has now occurred. It is also said that the bank authorities will provide generous funeral arrangements for Lu, as his family members are not in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Resisting Arrest, Opening Fire, Bandit Sentenced</h3>
<p>On the 5th of this month, at 7:15 PM, five bandits suddenly broke into the Yuan Da Coal Ball Company at 33 Alabaster Road, brandishing handguns and ordering the employees to remain silent. As they began to search for valuables, Hua Detective Huang Fusen and Detective Mu Liang Yuliang of the Shanghai Municipal Police rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm. In desperation, the bandits only managed to grab two gold rings. They were unable to seize other valuables and fled out the door. They encountered the detectives and opened fire to resist arrest and escape. The detectives returned fire. As a result, two of the bandits, Xu and Cai, were hit in vital areas and died one after another. They abandoned a handgun with five bullets. The detectives apprehended two bandits from Haimen, Chen Yaowen and Wang Yixiang. They learned that an accomplice from Haimen, Ni Chunfa, was hiding in a room at the Asian Hotel on Hankou Road. They rushed to the address and arrested Ni, along with a woman named Jiang Mao囡. They were taken to the police station and handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation. The trial judge, Zhong Qing, reviewed the case in court the other day. The police lawyer, Jiang Baolian, prosecuted them for the crime of gang robbery and stated that a leader named Wang Xilin was still at large and requested a thorough investigation. When questioned, the defendants gave evasive answers and asked for leniency. Judge Zhong sentenced Chen Yaowen, Wang Yixiang, and Ni Chunfa to five years in prison each. The handgun and bullets were confiscated, and one gold ring was returned to the owner.</p>
<h3>Stealing a Handgun, Committing a Crime, Arrested and Sentenced</h3>
<p>Tang Yonggen, a local Shanghai resident who was an apprentice at the Yongkang Pawnshop at 255 Kaifeng Road, was dismissed by his master, Wang Haicheng, in April of last year due to his gambling addiction. He had been unemployed for more than a year. In March of this year, he went to Nanxiang to seek work from his friend, Chuan Zheng hai (who worked at the local police station). He stole a Mauser handgun with five bullets. He secretly returned to Shanghai and committed a robbery in the Hongkou district. On May 10, at 7:50 AM, Tang Yonggen, armed with a handgun and two handcuffs, broke into the Yongkang Pawnshop on Kaifeng Road. He brandished the handgun and threatened his former master, Wang Haicheng, and shop employee Wang Bingji. He handcuffed them and robbed them of 343 pieces of gold jewelry and 978 yuan in cash. He fled with the loot but was spotted and arrested by detectives. He was handed over to the Special District Court for interrogation. The trial judge, Huang, sentenced Tang Yonggen to five years in prison. The handgun and bullets were confiscated, and the stolen goods were returned to the owner.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News from All Walks of Life</h3>
<p>Qian Huafu's Painted Fans: The Shanghai Buddhist painter Qian Huafu is a renowned artist, on par with Wang Yiting, the White Dragon Mountain Man. Since the passing of Mr. Wang, his works have been even more highly regarded. It is learned that Mr. Qian and the historian Ye Erkai have collaborated on one hundred painted fans to create an artistic connection with lovers of Buddhist painting. Each fan is temporarily priced at twenty yuan (including the calligraphy). No orders will be taken once the quota is full. Items can be sent to Qian Xiaofu at 9 Tongyi Fang, Danshui Road.</p>
<p>Female Doctor Qu Yahong Opens a Clinic: Female doctor Qu Yahong is the daughter of doctor Qu Shaoheng, a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology.

<h3>Gang Fight on Wenshi Road the Other Day, Caused by a Woman, Shoemaker Harassed a Woman Leading to Conflict, As a Result 25 Perpetrators Arrested</h3>
<p>Yesterday, local newspapers in this city published a piece of news about a large-scale gang fight between hooligans from Beinan Road and Qipu Road and dalbing (large pancake) cooks. According to the reporter from Shewen News Agency, the truth of the matter is quite different from what was originally reported. Therefore, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Harassment of Women Causes Strife</p>
<p>At 8:00 PM the night before (the 21st), at the Xinji Shoe Shop at 1 Changchun Lane, Wenshi Road, Public Concession, several shoemakers were cooling off at the alley entrance. At that time, a woman passed by. The shoemakers made fun of her. The woman left in anger. Unexpectedly, the woman was the sister-in-law of a gangster, nicknamed Auntie Yun. She was the mistress of Lu Chunlin, a famous hooligan known as Little Overlord in the Beinan Road area. Yun complained to Lu, who immediately went to negotiate. Unexpectedly, he was beaten by the shoemakers. Feeling humiliated, Lu gathered more than a hundred of his gang, each armed with iron rulers, iron rods, and nunchakus. They went to the scene with great fanfare to seek revenge.</p>
<p>A Chaotic Battle, Three Dead and Injured</p>
<p>The shoemakers at the shoe shop, knowing that they would definitely come back for revenge, also gathered more than one hundred shoemakers, holding sharp tools such as leather knives, and lined up on the road to wait. When the two sides met, a big fight broke out. For a time, shouts were heard. The nearby patrol officers were unable to stop it and immediately reported it to the Shanghai Municipal Police. Detective Feng Baishun and Deputy Detective Huang Fusen rushed to the scene to apprehend the perpetrators. The perpetrators fled in all directions. Twenty-five perpetrators were apprehended. It was discovered that Chen Xiaomao, a member of the gang, had a knife wound in the chest, and Wei Zhitong and Shi Lewen had back injuries. They were immediately sent to Baolong and Red Cross Hospitals for treatment. As a result, Chen died of his injuries. The police station will escort the apprehended criminals to the court this morning for questioning.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>I, Lin Daofu, would like to state that upon reading the news article titled "Embezzlement of Watch Materials" in your newspaper on the 12th of this month, I was deeply shocked. The Yixin Watch Shop is a business that I solely own. I entrusted my younger brother, Daohua, to assist in management, and the business is doing quite well. However, my wife, Chen, is aggressive, tyrannical, and unreasonable. I have repeatedly warned her to no avail, and I feel like I am sitting on pins and needles. Over time, I became ill from worry. In order to avoid troubles and recuperate, I followed my doctor's advice and temporarily resided at 77 Anshun Lane, Kangti Road. Recently, as a bill was due, I instructed my younger brother, Daohua, to move some of the goods to the Riverside Building as collateral. This is my disposal of my own property, and my younger brother carried out my instructions. No one has the right to object. Unexpectedly, the shrew Chen dared to falsely report a robbery to the police and arbitrarily slander my younger brother, causing him great suffering. Fortunately, the First Special District Court showed its impartiality and released him in court. These are the facts of what happened. However, the report in your newspaper is completely inconsistent with the facts. I have specially commissioned your lawyer to send a letter to the newspaper demanding correction. Based on this, I am writing to you to request that you investigate and make a correction. Yours sincerely, Lawyer Su Junbo, June 21st.</p>

<h3>Primary and Secondary Schools in Jiangsu Province Relocated to Shanghai to Resume Classes: Disbursement of Relief Funds According to Shanghai Standards</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Province's relocated primary and secondary schools in Shanghai requested the Ministry of Education to allocate relief funds, which was approved. In May, 151,000 yuan in relief funds was allocated to the schools. The disbursement process is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Telegram Requesting Equal Relief Due to Hardship: At the beginning of this semester, Shanghai schools, due to high prices and difficult living conditions, requested the Ministry of Education to allocate relief funds. The liaison office also needed to submit a report to the Ministry and Provincial Department, stating the difficult living conditions of colleagues in various schools, requesting equal relief as Shanghai schools. The Ministry, led by Lei You, adopted the suggestion and issued relief funds, along with a draft distribution plan. Schools in this province were to receive a total of 136,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Negotiating Distribution Standards: Minister Lei requested the liaison office to negotiate distribution standards with educational authorities in Shanghai, which had been done several times. At the same time, it was heard that the Central Government had allocated an additional 600,000 yuan. To ensure that schools could receive more relief, the liaison office immediately sent a telegram to the Ministry of Education, requesting a portion of the 600,000 yuan to be allocated for relief to private schools in this province. Furthermore, the relief funds for colleges and above in Shanghai totaled 400,000 yuan, while the technical classes of the Jiangsu Industrial School and Sericulture School in this province were not included. The liaison office also telegraphed the Ministry to request assistance, sending four telegrams in succession, urging prompt approval. It was expected that the Ministry of Education, mindful of the difficult situation of the relocated schools in this province, might slightly increase the allocation. However, due to the urgency, schools, noting that relief funds for Shanghai schools had already been issued, began demanding their allocations. Fearing further delays and misunderstandings, the liaison office negotiated with educational authorities on May 12th to increase the allocation by 15,000 yuan, bringing the total to 151,000 yuan, including the previously allocated 136,000 yuan. This was distributed without waiting for the Ministry's instructions.</p>
<p>(3) Reporting Distribution Results to the Ministry and Provincial Department: The liaison office had already reported the distribution plan to the Ministry for instructions. As no reply had been received, the liaison office consulted with educational authorities and, based on the Shanghai standards for public and private schools, determined the proportional amounts. Ninety percent for provincial middle schools, forty-five percent for public middle schools and provincial primary schools, twenty-four percent for county private middle schools, and twelve percent for county private primary schools were allocated from the total of 151,000 yuan. The distribution results were as follows: (1) 170 classes in provincial middle schools (excluding vocational classes) received 660 yuan per class, totaling 112,489 yuan; (2) 34 classes in public middle schools and provincial primary schools received 330 yuan per class, totaling 11,249 yuan; county private middle schools were verified to have 136 classes (including science labs and other educational institutions), receiving 176 yuan per class, totaling 23,998 yuan; county private primary schools had 37 classes, receiving 88 yuan per class, totaling 3,264 yuan, totaling 151,000 yuan. The liaison office has now reported the distribution results to the Ministry and Provincial Department. In addition, the relief funds for the vocational classes of the Sericulture School and Jiangsu Industrial School already existed, but the disbursement procedures were still being finalized, so they were not issued at the same time. (4) Supplementary Explanation on the Completion of Distribution: The nature of this relief fund differed from the previous subsidy, which was intended for administrative support. Therefore, schools could allocate a portion for school administrative expenses, with the remainder distributed as salary subsidies to teachers and staff. In accordance with the Provincial Department's instructions, a portion was allocated for emergency reserve funds for Shanghai schools and scholarships for poor students. This relief fund was specifically designated for relieving the living expenses of teachers and staff, and neither the school authorities nor the administrative authorities could allocate it for other purposes. (2) Regarding the distribution standards, Shanghai's standards were higher, with 900 yuan per class for public middle schools and 140 yuan per class for private middle schools. Schools in this province resuming classes in Shanghai had more classes, so following Shanghai standards would not be sufficient. If the Shanghai standards were followed for provincial or private schools, the allocation for other schools would be further reduced. Moreover, this relief fund was a general allocation for all schools in Shanghai. It was not possible to adopt the previous standards for the subsidy and it was also inconvenient to establish new standards that differed from those of Shanghai schools. Therefore, the liaison office, with the consent of relevant authorities, followed the Shanghai standards proportionally. (Dahua News Agency)</p>

<h3>Prospects of the Shanghai Textile Industry</h3>
<p>— Nie Guangzhong</p>
<p>After the Shanghai yarn market plummeted last summer, it only showed signs of recovery in October of last year due to the reopening of the Burma Road and the slightly smoother inland transportation. Since the beginning of spring, the general optimism has faded again, partly due to the Japanese military occupying the coast of western Guangdong and intensifying the coastal blockade; partly due to the disputes in Thailand and Vietnam, threatening the outbreak of war in the Far East at any time; and partly due to Japan intensifying its control over the markets in the occupied territories. In addition, the electricity supply in this city was reduced due to coal shortages. Since the end of February, some yarn factories have even implemented reduced working hours. Subsequently, due to the frequent blood-related cases in the city, the four major banks suspended operations for a time, and yarn prices soared with the rise in the exchange rate. As a result, manufacturers were happy again. However, before long, all kinds of unfavorable factors at the beginning of the year became more serious. The four major banks resumed operations, and the rumors subsided. In addition, with the establishment of the Sino-American and Sino-British exchange stabilization loans and the implementation of stabilization operations, the exchange rate loosened greatly, and the gold price collapsed. The yarn market then plummeted. Today, the gold price is falling sharply with small rebounds, and is in a state of decline. However, yarn prices have rebounded, and last weekend's situation became a surge, which is truly incredible.</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Exhaustion of Warehouse Receipts</h3>
<p>Commodity transactions, even if speculative, are ultimately determined by actual supply and demand. The current sharp rise in the spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn is said to be due to the tight supply of warehouse receipts and insufficient chips. This can also be regarded as the evolution of the law of supply and demand. However, the shortage of warehouse receipts is purely due to long positions buying up and closing out positions. Statistics show that the daily turnover of the yarn market is mostly inter-dealer transactions, and the amount sold to customers is negligible. As shown in the following table (in yuan):</p>
<p>The speculative nature of inter-dealer transactions is already well known. In fact, even the so-called customer transactions, in today's difficult transportation situation, are not without those who buy low and sell high. Customers, like securities firms and gold firms, are merely a label indicating the source, and are not necessarily all actual sales. Since they are not actual sales, inventories will not decrease. As for the purpose of long positions closing out warehouse receipts, it is nothing more than selling high. Therefore, the temporary shortage of chips today is the abundance of chips tomorrow. This goes without saying.</p>
<h3>Accumulation of Yarn Day by Day and Month by Month</h3>
<p>The rice market is different from the yarn market. Rice is mainly consumed locally, and its supply area is in other cities. Therefore, hoarders have the possibility of local manipulation, but they are still no match for the impact of public sales of cheap rice. Yarn is the opposite. Its supply area is local, and its main consumption area is in other cities. Only when external freight is smooth, there will be a situation of demand exceeding supply, so that hoarders can be sure to make profits. Unfortunately, at this time and in this place, external sales are extremely unlikely. On the contrary, the rise in yarn prices has prompted manufacturers to increase production and sell futures. Therefore, yarn hoarders cannot insist on not selling like rice hoarders, because their most likely encounter is overproduction leading to oversupply.</p>
<p>According to Finance &amp; Commerce, as of the end of February this year, there were 67 Chinese and foreign yarn factories in this city, with a total of more than 2.64 million spindles. Their maximum yarn production can reach 130,000 bales per month. After March, Japanese yarn factories reduced working hours by more than 50%, and British factories also reduced working hours by about 30%. Chinese merchants followed suit and reduced night shifts. However, at that time, the city's yarn production still reached more than 75,000 bales. Although there were further reductions in working hours by Chinese merchants due to electricity rationing, since the sharp rise in yarn prices in early May, those who had reduced production also resumed one after another. Therefore, the current yarn production is 90,000 to 100,000 bales per month.</p>
<p>Although supply is increasing, customer sales have not improved. Judging from the changes in yarn inventories in each month of this year, the most recent figures seem to have been affected by the reduction in working hours and are gradually decreasing. However, compared with the same period last year, there has been an increase in every month, and the increase has almost exceeded 50% to 60%. This shows the intensity of speculation in the current yarn market, and it also shows how serious its future dangers are.</p>
<p>The above yarn inventory figures are limited to those in warehouses. If we estimate the entire city, it should be more than 330,000 to 340,000 bales. In view of the difficulty of transportation, the sluggish actual sales, and the rising yarn prices stimulating yarn factories to increase production, the cotton yarn inventories are expected to continue to increase in the future.</p>
<h3>Cotton Inventories Increase with Time</h3>
<p>In terms of actual sales channels, the cotton yarn in this city is still mainly sold to various parts of the Southwest and the occupied territories. Those exported to various parts of Southeast Asia account for only about 10%, and their position is not very important. However, recently, the coastal blockade has not been relaxed, the ports of eastern Zhejiang have been closed, the markets in the occupied territories have been prohibited from importing, and the situation in Southeast Asia is becoming more and more tense. Although international diplomatic activities are still uncertain, the general trend is that the United States and the Soviet Union are on the brink of war. If there are no sudden changes in the international situation in the future, there will be no way to open up the sales channels for cotton yarn. The degree of overproduction will become more serious. The demand for raw cotton will naturally decrease.</p>
<p>If the United States participates in the war, the import of American cotton to China will become a problem. However, the actual sales channels will also come to an end. In addition, recently, due to the easing of foreign exchange, manufacturers have taken the opportunity to settle a large amount of imported cotton. In addition, due to the reduction in working hours in March, cotton yarn consumption has also decreased. Therefore, the current cotton inventories in this city are also increasing sharply. Judging from the current operating conditions of yarn factories, the current cotton inventories are enough to supply more than five months of consumption in the future.</p>
<p>Although the New York cotton market has been rising in recent months (the current price per pound is about one cent higher than last month), fortunately, the exchange rate of Shanghai to the US dollar is also continuing to fall, which can offset the increase, and the burden on manufacturers has not increased as a result. As for transportation ships, after the presidential ship was requisitioned, a replacement has been designated to come to Shanghai. As Shanghai is the largest and last stronghold of American interests in China, as long as its role exists, transportation conditions and business relations will also exist. This can be asserted. Therefore, the fate of the cotton spinning industry in this city lies not in raw cotton but in actual sales. If actual sales cannot be opened up, the fragile foothold of the yarn market will not be improved.</p>
<h3>The Inside Story of Short Positions Paying Out</h3>
<p>However, at this time and in this place, the sluggish actual sales are an irredeemable fate. There are nets outside and machines inside. Managing it depends only on speculative transactions. Knowing that speculative transactions are inherently prone to sharp rises and falls, knowledgeable people all know that moving to a better place is the right choice. However, those who are short-sighted do not plan for this. Instead, they use speculative activities to create various schemes in order to maintain yarn prices at a relatively high level. What they do is not enough. They know that this is not a long-term solution, but they only seek to temporarily raise yarn prices in order to sell spot goods and futures as much as possible, and obtain profits similar to scalping. When yarn prices fall back, the losses will belong to others. They can then safely produce the futures that have already been sold at high prices. After all the high-priced futures that have been sold have been produced in full, if yarn prices still do not improve, they can then find another way. Like the previous Double Horse market, it was called spot trading, but there was actually no time limit. This is to encourage hoarding. Charging interest to long positions and collecting warehouse rent is to increase their costs and ensure that yarn prices rise day by day. Yarn prices can rise faster than others. However, recently, due to the too high rise in yarn prices, and because short positions are not subject to time constraints, and because long positions have various burdens while short positions do not, people have changed to short positions. Especially since the surge in yarn prices in early May this year, short positions in the Double Horse market have become more favorable. As a result, the yarn market, which is overproduced, has become more and more depressed.</p>
<p>At a time when hoarding is rampant, prices of all goods are rising, and people's livelihoods are declining, anything that can suppress rising prices, no matter what the motive, seems to be beneficial to people's livelihoods and should be temporarily retained. The long positions' interest subsidy method is one example. Unfortunately, the so-called Double Horse market authorities did not plan for this. Instead, they reversed the previous system and created a short positions' payout method last week, opening a way out for yarn-hoarding long positions. They can transfer their interest burden to short positions. They seem to be afraid that people will not hoard yarn and that yarn prices will not rise.</p>
<p>Since the creation of the short positions' payout method, the yarn prices, which had been sluggish, jumped horizontally under the addition of long positions and the reversal of short positions, and surged nearly 100 yuan per bale last week. The short positions' payout method can be said to have fulfilled its responsibility for the price-raising plan. However, who can believe that the yarn market can be relied on only for speculation and be revived?</p>
<p>From the speculator's point of view, the interest to be paid by long positions can be offset by the payout of short positions. But in fact, long positions can only obtain a part of the short positions' payout, and the other part is obtained by the intermediaries. Therefore, long positions still need to bear part of the interest and still need to pay warehouse rent, so their total burden is actually no less than that of short positions. The only beneficiaries are speculative banks.</p>
<h3>Spot Prices More Expensive Than Futures, Getting Further and Further Apart</h3>
<p>Not only that, at a time when yarn production is excessive, inventories are piled up, and external sales are extremely limited due to transportation difficulties and other factors, and the international situation is becoming more and more dangerous, the general trend is not optimistic. Looking back, since the opening of the so-called futures yarn market, futures yarn prices have always been 50 to 60 yuan lower than spot yarn prices. Last week, spot yarn prices surged nearly 100 yuan, while futures yarn prices rose only 40 yuan. Therefore, the difference between the two has now reached a huge 100 yuan. The bleak prospects of the yarn market can be seen. (Unit: Yuan)</p>
<p>When the so-called futures yarn market was first opened, speculators with strong financial strength sold spot goods to the spot yarn market and bought to the futures yarn market, obtaining huge arbitrage profits from it. At this stage, the futures yarn price should have moved in the opposite direction to the spot yarn price; in fact, the futures yarn still rose and fell with the spot yarn. Today, because the spot yarn is much more expensive than the futures yarn, short spot positions also changed to futures yarn to cover their position; therefore, the turnover of the futures yarn is almost equal to that of the spot yarn. Logically, the futures yarn should rise and fall in proportion to the spot yarn; in fact, the opposite is true. The spot yarn is surging, but the rise in the futures yarn is extremely limited, which is even more thought-provoking.</p>
<h3>News and Knowledge of the Yarn Market</h3>
<p>— Spoken by Mr. Zhang Yifan, Notes by Feng Zhida</p>
<p>——Textbook for "Business Journalism" at the School of Commerce, University of Shanghai——</p>
<p>The modern textile industry in our country sprouted in 1890; ten years later, it faced competition from British merchants setting up factories in China; five years later, Japanese merchants followed suit. During World War I, the pressure from foreign merchants temporarily eased, and national industries were able to catch their breath; at that time, Chinese yarn businesses developed particularly rapidly. However, the competition from Japanese merchants also intensified simultaneously. As of before the August 13th Incident, Chinese merchants accounted for only 50% of the total number of spindles in the country, while Japanese merchants accounted for as much as 45%. British merchants were confined to a corner of Shanghai, and their position was no longer important. After the outbreak of the war, Chinese-owned yarn factories were either destroyed by artillery fire or "managed" by the Japanese. Only those in the Shanghai International Settlement survived. Statistics show that of the 2,628,000 spindles owned by Chinese merchants before the war, 1,200,000 were destroyed by artillery fire, and 862,000 were controlled by the Japanese. However, there were quite a few small-scale yarn factories newly established in the Shanghai International Settlement and various provinces in the southwest.</p>
<p>Count The fineness of cotton yarn is expressed in counts. Each count is 840 yards long, which is the same both domestically and abroad. For example, 10-count yarn is 8,400 yards long; 20-count yarn is 16,800 yards long. The lower the count, the coarser the yarn. Conversely, the higher the count, the finer the yarn. Generally, yarn below 19 counts is called coarse yarn, yarn above 20 counts is called medium yarn, and yarn above 45 counts is called fine yarn.</p>
<p>Bales of Yarn Cotton yarn is traded in bales, also known as pieces. Each bale weighs 400 pounds net. Each bale is divided into four grass bundles, and each grass bundle is divided into ten small bundles; each small bundle (or skein) weighs ten pounds and is divided into several yarn balls according to the count. For example, 10-count yarn is divided into ten yarn balls; 20-count yarn is divided into twenty yarn balls. Each yarn ball is uniformly divided into ten large skeins. Each large skein is further divided into seven small skeins. Each small skein is uniformly 840 yards long. Small bundles are wrapped in paper, and grass bundles are wrapped in grass bags. Large bales (i.e., bales) are wrapped in burlap and bound with iron hoops. The unit for reporting yarn prices and bidding prices is one large bale.</p>
<p>Types Cotton yarn can be classified by count, such as 10-count yarn and 20-count yarn; it can also be classified by fineness, such as coarse yarn and fine yarn. In terms of processing, there are distinctions between single-strand, double-strand, multi-strand, right-hand twist, and left-hand twist. Single-strand yarn is spun from a single strand of yarn, and those below 20 counts are all single-strand yarn. Double-strand yarn is spun from two strands of yarn, hence it is also known as "money." Fine yarn above 30 counts is sometimes twisted from three strands of yarn, which is what is called three-strand yarn. When spinning, yarn spindles that turn to the right are called right-hand twist; those that turn to the left are called left-hand twist. The yarn used in hand-operated wooden looms in rural areas is all right-hand twist. However, for machine weaving, the suitability of using right-hand or left-hand yarn depends on the arrangement of the machine. In addition, there are types such as lightning yarn and milky yarn. The former uses high-speed machines to pass the yarn through the flame of an electric arc, burning off the fine hairs on the yarn, resulting in a glossy product. The latter is immersed in caustic soda solution to give it a silk-like appearance.</p>
<p>Quality The quality of cotton yarn is determined by: (1) whether the color is good; (2) whether the thickness is uniform; (3) the strength of the twist; (4) the amount of fuzz. Yarn that is glossy in color, fine and uniform, can be stretched, and has less fuzz is considered to be of superior quality. Cotton yarn is traded on exchanges, so the quality of each product is first assessed to determine its grade; then, a certain type of yarn is designated as the standard product, so as to determine the limits of price increases or decreases for various yarns of the same or different grades.</p>
<p>Cost The cost of cotton yarn is broadly divided into two categories: one is the cost of raw cotton, and the other is the cost of manufacturing. The cost of raw cotton is the value of the raw cotton used. Generally, each bale of 20-count yarn uses about 350 pounds of raw cotton. The raw cotton cost is calculated by multiplying the current price of raw cotton by the amount of cotton used. Manufacturing costs include wages, power, management, taxes, and fire and water insurance costs per bale. Based on the current situation, the total cost of each bale of 20-count yarn should not exceed 1,345 yuan. Today's yarn prices have risen significantly, and the thick profits of manufacturers can be imagined.</p>
<p>Yarn Factories Yarn factories are the basic suppliers of the yarn market. Before the August 13th Incident, there were 31 Chinese-owned yarn factories in Shanghai, with more than 1,237,000 spindles, producing more than 540,000 bales of yarn annually. There were more than 8,750 looms, producing 150,000 to 160,000 square yards of cloth annually. In addition, there were 33 Japanese-owned yarn factories in Shanghai, with 1,358,000 spindles and more than 1,360 looms. There were four British-owned yarn factories, with 187,000 spindles and 2,890 looms, so they had long presented a situation of the guest overshadowing the host. After the outbreak of the war, as many as 21 yarn factories outside the concession area were damaged by the war, and 10 were "managed" by the Japanese. However, within the concession area, new yarn factories sprang up like mushrooms after rain. As of the end of February of this year, the existing yarn factories and their equipment in Shanghai are generally as shown in the following table.</p>
<p>It is estimated that if all the existing spindles in Chinese and foreign yarn factories in the city are put into operation, the maximum yarn production should be around 150,000 bales per month, requiring about 170,000 to 180,000 bales of raw cotton.</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Because domestic cotton has short fibers, yarns with higher counts need to be mixed with American cotton. Therefore, cotton imports have always been one of the biggest burdens on Shanghai's foreign exchange. This was the case before the war, and even more so during the war. Because cotton production in the occupied areas is controlled by the Japanese, and the amount of surplus cotton sold to Shanghai last year was only about 400,000 bales, factories need to rely even more on imports. In this environment of fluctuating exchange rates and unpredictable international situations, manufacturers are most concerned about the source of cotton. Precisely because of this, whenever foreign exchange rates are favorable, manufacturers import in large quantities, so the amount of raw cotton stored in Shanghai regularly maintains enough for more than half a year's needs.</p>
<p>Sales Channels Yarn is the main raw material for our clothing. Because of the abundance of yarn factories in Shanghai, it has always been the main supply area for cotton yarn in the country, with a considerable amount being re-exported every year. After the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, the North China market was closed by Japanese merchants, followed by the closure of the gateways to Central China and even the occupied areas of South China. Therefore, the export of cotton yarn from this city is only limited to free China, and in recent years, attention has also been paid to the development of the Nanyang market. However, the absorption capacity of this new market accounts for at most only 5% to 6% of the total output, which is entirely absorbed by weaving factories in this city and the free areas in the southwest. Last autumn, the Japanese army intensified its blockade of our coast, followed by the British closure of the Burma Road. The inland gateways were completely closed. As a result, the yarn industry in this city was almost completely suffocated. Suspensions of work and reductions in work followed one after another, and the disastrous fall in yarn prices was beyond recovery. From this, it can be seen that the southwest sales channels are the lifeline of the yarn industry in this city.</p>
<p>Market Before the war, the cotton yarn trade in this city was concentrated in the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange. After the outbreak of the war, the exchange was ordered to close. Subsequently, speculative merchants organized a black market, which moved several times and is now located downstairs in a certain building at Tongli Geli on Beijing Road. Upstairs in the same building is the Japanese yarn market. It is designated that 20-count Shuangma yarn is the standard for all cotton yarn transactions, nominally only doing spot transactions, but in fact, there is no deadline constraint. Now, a futures market has been set up on Aidoa Road, trading in contracts with terms of one to two months. It also uses 20-count Shuangma as the standard, but it is called "Golden Shuangma," while spot Shuangma is called "factory order" to show the difference. Even so, spot Shuangma is still nominal, and it is still possible to buy and sell short, but the bulls have to pay interest every day, which is a major source of income for banks. The bears have no burden. But from last week, the bears also have to pay, and this money is collected by the bulls, so the bulls' interest burden is reduced. But speculators will not be stingy with this burden; what they are pursuing is greater profit.</p>
<p>Interest Payment This is the biggest source of income for banks. Currently, cotton yarn speculation starts with five bales. Each bale of cotton yarn is worth about 1,450 yuan, so five bales require a total of 7,250 yuan. Assuming a margin of 200 yuan is deducted, the bank nominally advances 7,050 yuan for the bull, and the monthly interest is calculated at 1.1%, so the bull's monthly interest burden is more than nine yuan. In addition, there are also storage and commission fees to be paid. In fact, the bank does not really advance funds to buy for the bull. At most, it only buys the excess amount of bulls after offsetting the bulls and bears on that day. If the excess amount is for the bears, then there is no need to advance funds to buy at all. However, it still charges interest from every bull customer. Now, this interest is paid by the bears. In the end, it is still collected by the bank. Moreover, because this payment amount is constantly changing, and the right to allocate it belongs to the bank, the bulls may not be able to collect it all, and the bank still has to divide a portion of it. This is another way to make money. Therefore, the victory of speculators belongs to the bank. (Note) This draft has been revised and supplemented by Mr. Zhang.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Both American and Indian Cotton Markets Rise</h3>
<p>The New York cotton market initially weakened due to good crop yield forecasts but rebounded due to purchases by spot traders and industry players. As a result, closing prices rose by 9 to 11 points compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Bombay cotton market rose due to purchases by speculators and industry players. As a result, closing prices rose by 0.50 to 4 rupees 75 compared to the previous day. Also, the forecast price has not yet been reached.</p>
<p>In addition, the following are Indian cotton statistics recorded from September 1, last year, to June 21, this year (per bale of 400 pounds):</p>
<p>Total listed in Bombay: 2,770,004 bales</p>
<p>Remaining in Bombay: 1,411,000 bales</p>
<p>Total listed in Karachi: 1,201,000 bales</p>
<p>Exports from Karachi: 1,134,000 bales</p>
<p>Remaining in Karachi: 275,000 bales</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Jinshan Branches Progress Step by Step</h3>
<p>Because this year's new Jinshan branch goods have been reported to have failed, the old goods in the Shanghai market have been progressing step by step. Yesterday, the market price of high-quality Yuan branches sold by Yuan Branch Shops reached 260 to 270 yuan, flat branches 170 to 180 yuan, and Lanzhu branches have also been shouting high. According to a letter from Zhangzhou, the new goods are only two tenths.</p>
<h3>Hainan Dried Longan Rises Sharply, Tianjin Almonds Arrive</h3>
<p>Hainan dried longan, because there has been a recent lack of continuous arrivals, and most have been transferred to refrigerated warehouses, to seek future good prices, so the number of existing goods is even scarcer. Yesterday, it was heard that a number of goods opened by Beishi Haojia, with good appearance and color, rose by 30 yuan, and ordinary goods rose by more than 10 yuan. Hao goods are almost sold out, and the future market price of high-quality goods may reach 300 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 19 pieces of almonds were shipped from Tianjin, and 300 bags of raw peanuts came from Yantai.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Items: Soap and Matches Rise Together, Foreign Candles Also Follow Good Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>Soap Raw materials such as coconut oil are rumored to have been secretly purchased by Germany, and then, with the frequent rise in cigarette prices on the market, all parties have resumed purchasing. Holders have tightened buying prices, and factory shipments are as sparse as stars in the morning. Therefore, prices have followed suit and risen. It is estimated that the new boxes of Guben Soap are 54 yuan, Baixiang Mao Soap 44 yuan, and Huangxiang Mao Soap 43 yuan, all up 3 to 4 yuan from before.</p>
<p>Matches It is rumored that the unified tax will be increased, and the establishment of a joint sales association is possible. Future buying prices will inevitably rise. Peers and hoarders continue to purchase and accumulate, so prices have continued to rise by white yuan compared to before. For example, Meili Pi has risen to 750 yuan per box, Fenghuang Brand 730 yuan, second-class miscellaneous brands 630 yuan, and third-class brands 580 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, Baili's Ship Brand foreign candles, 28 yuan and 8 jiao per box, have also risen by 1 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News: Woolen Fabrics and Materials Arrive, Butter Leather Also Comes to Shanghai</h3>
<p>This year, the Shanghai woolen fabric market commonly says that, in addition to British foreign firms still accepting orders for Western woolen fabrics, it is unpredictable whether they can come to Shanghai due to changes in the current situation. Therefore, those inside and outside the industry are constantly hoarding goods, regarding them as rare treasures. Yesterday, 22 boxes of woolen fabrics and 418 pieces of wool were shipped from Hong Kong. With this support, manufacturers do not have to worry about not having goods to weave.</p>
<p>The price of Shanghai cowhide is also unprecedentedly high. Therefore, the price of shoe sole leather is high and difficult to purchase. Yesterday, 109 pieces of cowhide were also shipped from Hong Kong, and 198 pieces of butter came from Tianjin, which can be used for soap making and other purposes.</p>
<h3>Hardware: The Market for This Local Yuan Nail is Stagnant</h3>
<p>The market for this local factory's Yuan nails, which has been without improvement for a long time, remains stagnant recently. Because the only outlet to the Nanyang Islands is currently without any search and receipt, and Beiyang gangs and inland river merchants on the Yangtze River Road are also uninterested, the transactions are only with small factories and scattered users in this street. Transactions are naturally quiet, and it is difficult to see the morale boosted. The market atmosphere remains sluggish. Recently, the asking price for each barrel of Beisi price is still 160 yuan, which has not seen honor or disgrace compared to the previous market. However, the bottom plate is particularly loose.</p>

<h3>The Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation of Wang Danlao</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Mr. Dan Kui has noble character and is a famous elder of Jiangsu. After resigning as a member of the Daohuai Committee, he lived in seclusion in agriculture, writing books and making speeches, asking about rain and assessing sunshine, enjoying himself leisurely. After the Incident, he lived in Shanghai and suffered from nasal cancer. Because of his old age and weakness, he passed away on the 17th of this month. The next day, the coffin was closed at the Central Funeral Home. Many students and old friends went to see him off, and when talking about the longevity of this elder (82 years old), it was due to his moderation in clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Excerpts are taken to fulfill this publication.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang was originally from Nanjing, followed officials to Chongming, and Du Yan Gong died in Chongming. The family could not support the coffin back to their hometown, so they were buried outside the northeast city, and then lived in Chongming. He was poor at home and worked hard, so he always used cotton fabrics for "clothing" and did not seek beauty. After gaining fame in the Gengchen year, he went from the Shuchang Scattered Library Department Cao to Nanyang to investigate commerce, and then served as a Shangbu Canyi Right Cheng. He still adhered to the principle of wearing coarse cloth clothes and rarely made silk clothes. He also strongly discouraged luxury in the clothes worn by his family. Because Chongming produces cotton, his family's style focuses on diligence and thrift, not only growing and spinning their own cotton, but also dyeing and making it themselves. Clean and simple is enough to describe it. He had no bad habits in his life and hated opium even more. His father, Mr. Pingyi, gave him the name Qingmu, which contained the meaning of encouraging him to emulate Lin Wenzhong Gong as a famous Confucian and a famous minister. Mr. Wang regarded Wenzhong's political achievements, banning opium, and dissolving Liuhe as the most important, so he wrote articles to persuade the people to reject drugs and wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with Britain about the official sale of opium in Hong Kong, criticizing in words and writing without any effort. Regarding water conservancy, he wrote books such as "The Strategy of Water Control and Disaster Prevention in the Taihu Basin" and "A Brief Description of Inspecting the Liuhe Qipu Baimao Water Conservancy," with thorough discussions and benefits to people's livelihood. He did not seek beauty in "food" and embraced the principle of being frugal and refined in diet, regarding garden vegetables as more precious than delicacies, so he was a vegetarian in his later years. In view of the soaring rice prices and the difficulty of civilian life, in addition to writing three articles on rice, he once wrote to the authorities, advocating to investigate the households that need food and flat rice, compile registers, and order wealthy people to donate funds to run flat rice sales, and determine the amount of flat rice sales according to the number of people, so that there would be no partiality. The measures he set were fair, detailed, and worthy of emulation. He did not advocate building luxurious houses for "housing." In the fourth year of the Republic of China, he built a tomb for his parents' coffins behind Dashiqiao in Baochenxi, 50 miles from the city, and then built a house on the left of the tomb to live in, named Nongyinlu. In addition to reading the Rites, he arranged the tomb fields. On the left, right, and rear three sides of the hut, he dug ditches to store fish. There was a bamboo garden to the north of the ditch, a lotus pond at the gate, and a small garden. Along the road, ditches, and plants, there were thousands of elm, catalpa, locust, and willow trees, like a rural home. On weekdays, he mingled with farmers and interacted with villagers and elders. Because he was grateful for the help of the villagers during construction, he named this area Deyicun. He founded Shecang to imitate Zhu Zi's method of spring distribution and autumn collection, and donated a Qiuqiji Elementary School with an attached agricultural experiment field, so that students could learn farming in their spare time. He spent time talking about mulberry and hemp with farmers, as if it were the first Taohuayuan. After the Incident, he moved to Shanghai, and the rented house was unusually small. In view of the insatiable greed of Shanghai's second landlords, he wrote articles to advise them, but those who were taught were sincere, and those who listened were disdainful. This is also clear evidence that people's hearts are not ancient, only value money, and do not abide by morality. The problem of "transportation" is greatly related to Mr. Wang. During the Qing Dynasty, the discussion of the Suzhou-Zhejiang Railway's commercial operation was very heated. Mr. Wang was elected as the director and pioneered the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. In the Xinhai year, he had a brief discussion on advising Suzhou railway shareholders to recover the Nanqian railway funds and organize a bank. In addition to detailing the advantages and disadvantages of state-owned and commercially operated railways, he advocated strict supervision of the government's large foreign debts to increase the burden on the people. It was very thorough. Last year, he also wrote "The Painful History of China's Self-Run Railway," lamenting that the railways were nationalized, and the commercially operated shares were either returned or reduced slightly. The loss of the people's investment was small. He borrowed foreign debts to build them, and the loss of rights and interests and the extension of the term of the railway debts caused great losses to the people. As for his personal travel, he advocated walking in his youth, and did not prepare a chartered car in his later years. His contentment with poverty and love of Taoism is even more worthy of imitation.</p>
<h3>New York's Chinese Summer Fashion</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Take the strengths of others to make up for one's own weaknesses, so I often advocate that Chinese studies should be the warp, and Western studies should be the weft. Chinese and Western exchanges will lead to great achievements in academics. This is true of spiritual culture, and why not of material things? The advantage of Chinese clothing is comfort. The disadvantage is inconvenience. The advantage of Western clothing is convenience, but the disadvantage is tightness. If they can be used together, taking the strengths and making up for the weaknesses, wouldn't that be wonderful? Recently, I read a New York communication that said, "...On May 25th, at the closing of the American China Aid Week, a Chinese cloth exhibition was held at the Hotel Astor in New York, inviting the press to publicize it widely. Among them, patterns such as dragons and phoenixes, ancient coins, butterflies, flower girls, and figures all have the flavor of ancient Chinese times. They are elegant, pleasing to the eye, and warmly welcomed by the local American women. Currently, 65 famous American weaving factories have unanimously participated in weaving, according to the above-mentioned various patterns, weaving 4.5 million yards, which is designated as the 1941 style... At the same time, Ms. Zhang Qianyang, a Chinese living in the United States, gave a speech on Chinese styles at the Biltimore Hotel on the afternoon of June 4th, explaining the influence of Chinese styles on American women's summer fashion styles in 1941. She also said that the Chinese styles she introduced were not directly copied from Chinese samples, but were the result of indirect influence; for example, the "Lotus Leaves Emerging from Water" picture she saw in Hangzhou indirectly inspired her to improve the shape of the "Chinese Umbrella" and influenced the style of the "Chinese Umbrella" she introduced. Ms. Zhang has maintained close contact with the American United Relief Association to promote Chinese styles..." I often see Western women wearing Chinese cheongsams, looking graceful and beautiful, while the so-called progressive Chinese women's clothing is bought by many masters, and there are gifts such as wooden boxes and stoves. Today, not to mention that the gifts are neither Chinese nor Western, isn't it strange? To cherish the national essence, we should pay attention to our country's inherent "summer fashion" and use ingenuity to plant, cultivate, and promote it. I look forward to it.</p>

<h3>One Week's Family Meal Plan</h3>
<p>— Ms. Huaying</p>
<p>The vegetables and beans that are on the market in early summer, the knife beans are old, and the green peppers are also spicy: fortunately, the eggplant is just right. There are two types of eggplant, the thin and long one is the Ningbo variety, and the thick and conical one is the local variety. The Ningbo variety has fewer seeds and is glutinous, which the local variety cannot match. The current price is about 2.5 jiao per catty, and from an economic point of view, you can also eat it. My family loves to eat eggplant, so we have been eating it every day for the past few days. Dong's method has three types. One is eggplant stuffed with meat, digging out the eggplant belly and chopping the pork into mince and adding good soy sauce to stuff it in. The second is deep-fried eggplant with batter, breaking up and stirring eggs and putting them in flour, and cutting the eggplant into sections and dragging them in flour to deep-fry. The third is stir-fried eggplant with shrimp roe, which is very simple. You only need to buy some dried shrimp roe from the southern goods store and stir-fry it with the eggplant. As for the vegetarian method, one is to braise the eggplant with sweet sauce, and the other is to steam the eggplant and mix it with soy sesame oil or sesame sauce, which are both very delicious.</p>

<h3>Coal Balls, Past and Present</h3>
<p>— Jing Shusen</p>
<p>"Tofu and meat are the same price" - this sentence was originally a description of the high price of things; but now, it can almost be said: "It has become a reality." That said, if you compare it with other commodity prices, then, the price, which is less than ten times different from before the war, is not very expensive! Because there are even more expensive commodity prices that I can tell you!</p>
<p>What are even more expensive commodity prices? I think readers will definitely point out the rice price of 150 yuan per stone, right? Yes, rice prices are indeed very expensive, but the ratio of its difference from before the war is still less than fifteen or sixteen times; only coal balls, which cost seventeen or eighteen yuan per load, exceed the pre-war price by more than ten times. This ratio is truly shocking!</p>
<p>Our lives depend entirely on eating to maintain; except for melons and fruits, which can be eaten raw, everything else must be cooked? Like in rural areas, you can still use other plants as fuel, but only in this city of Shanghai, because of the population, location, and equipment, you must use coal balls!</p>
<p>I remember that before the war, coal balls were only 70 or 80 cents per load; if you were old, you wouldn't even be able to buy official goods. Often, you would pay a high price and buy inferior goods. People's hearts are not ancient; this is extremely</p>
<p>Recently, in the newspaper, someone claiming to be a "sucker" posted a large advertisement about coal balls. This is a well-intentioned person with a lot of bitterness, worthy of our praise!</p>
<p>In fact, doing business and buying and selling is a legitimate act of seeking profit from capital; however, in this period of national crisis, engaging in hoarding and raising prices is already a criminal offense; now that you have raised someone else's price, you still want to let people be "sucked." Is this something that a "person" should do! Although merchants love profit more than rulers love beauty, don't "forget" the "eight" characters "genuine goods at fair prices, honest to all ages" hanging on your door!</p>
<h3>New Discussions on "Living" Overseas</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>A department store in New York recently installed a new type of lighting equipment that is almost indistinguishable from sunlight. They installed many 1,000-watt Nova-Lux lamps inside the white walls. The light is first reflected from the walls, making it soft and brilliant. People even think it's sunlight. When turning the lights on or off in the morning or evening, this novel light doesn't suddenly brighten or dim, but gradually changes over about fifteen minutes. Isn't this just like the moment before the sun rises or sets?</p>
<p>Sears, Roebuck and Co. in Chicago is the only store in the world without glass windows. The engineer who built this house said that regulating air and equipping lights in this type of glassless building is easier to manage than others. Furthermore, operating expenses can be reduced significantly. The goods in the store are no longer exposed to strong sunlight and damaged; the noise from outside can all be avoided, and besides, we can save a lot of wall space to store goods.</p>
<p>Brief News: The Modern Celebrity Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition, hosted by Cunde Middle School at 149 Guba Road, will officially open on the 27th of this month. The exhibition will last for two days and close on the 29th. Twenty percent of the sales proceeds will be used specifically for scholarship loans. At the same time, the labor products of all primary and secondary school students, such as toys, embroidery, and knitting, will be sold in a charity sale. This action benefits poor students and is indeed significant.</p>

<h3>Suicide</h3>
<p>— Jue Hui</p>
<p>When it comes to something that can truly shine through the ages and be immortal, nothing is more suitable than suicide.</p>
<p>The origins of suicide, and who started it, have been lost to classical research; but it has existed since ancient times, so there is no need to avoid talking about it. If you don't believe it, there is plenty of evidence:</p>
<p>In the past, women could not easily be seen by others. A maiden in her boudoir, for "some reason," was glanced at by a "slick rogue." She cried for three days, starved for three days, and silently hanged herself from the beam.</p>
<p>In the past, men were not allowed to show their faces in public except to study and seek fame. A scholar from a scholarly family went to the street "in person" to buy a pancake. His wife, upon hearing the news, immediately jumped into the well and died.</p>
<p>This proves that current suicides are not only "seeking antiquity"; but also a secret recipe handed down from ancestors!</p>
<p>But the methods have become scientific: raw opium, lysol, arsenic, electricity, the Huangpu River is uncovered, and so on.</p>
<p>The reasons have also expanded: family property gambled away, burdened with debt; the cosmetics market, empty-handed; love battlefield, defeated in a love triangle; and some are truly because they have no food to eat. And so on.</p>
<p>However, although progress has been made step by step, the sensation is far less than in ancient times! Previously, suicide might still have the hope of erecting a monument of chastity; but now, even providing a coffin is precarious; probably because there are too many such events, it is not surprising.</p>
<p>In fact, thinking calmly: "A good death is better than a bad life"; living and fighting hard can still accomplish two things, is there really a ghost after death?</p>
<p>Especially at the moment, today, at this very minute, we simply cannot find any reason to commit suicide...</p>
<p>Those who commit suicide are all "insects" in Ah Q's mouth!</p>
<h3>Talking About Tuition Fees</h3>
<p>— Xu Daming</p>
<p>In today's world where the prices of everything are skyrocketing, tuition fees are certainly no exception. Because the living expenses of teachers and staff are also rising along with the high prices, the school's expenses have to increase as well. Therefore, we say that due to unavoidable price increases, it is "understandable" today - in order to overcome this "difficult time" together.</p>
<p>However, we must pay attention to the fact that some principals are using the school as a "speculative market" under the pretext of "huge expenses."</p>
<p>Therefore, at the moment when schools throughout Shanghai are discussing how to increase tuition and miscellaneous fees for the next semester, we have the need to provide methods.</p>
<p>This can be divided into two aspects:</p>
<p>First, regarding private schools, this issue is relatively serious, because the power to increase or decrease private school tuition fees is in the hands of the principal alone, but this is not without solutions. One is to exert collective strength—the families of all students (or start by implementing it by grade, and then gradually expand it to the entire school, which may be easier) must have an organization that is responsible for reviewing. In this way, the tuition fees of their children can achieve the effect of cooperation between the school and the family. At the same time, teachers can also be contacted to supervise together.</p>
<p>Second, we know that most private schools in Shanghai receive the "Shanghai Municipal Council Private School Subsidy." Therefore, in addition to being responsible for the preliminary assessment and investigation of the equipment of each school, the Chinese Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council should pay more attention to the economic avenues of each school after receiving the subsidy, especially the expenses of tuition and miscellaneous fees. The Chinese Education Department should be responsible for providing advice to avoid increasing the burden on parents. We hope that this can be combined with the above point and carried out simultaneously to exert greater power.</p>
<p>Secondly, we must also consider the issue of fee increases in public schools.</p>
<p>But this is not an unsolvable problem. From the perspective of the Shanghai Municipal Council: First, reduce the rate of fee increases and automatically reduce the burden on parents; second, increase the number of free places. Third, we have seen Mr. Sheng Zhensheng’s "Report on the Implementation of the Half-Day Double-Shift System for Primary Schools" in the "Primary School Teachers" monthly magazine. After reading it, we feel that the Shanghai Municipal Council should increase the number of schools of this nature (low tuition fees and supplies provided by the Shanghai Municipal Council) as much as possible so that children in the concession have the opportunity to enroll universally. However, one thing must be noted, that is, schools of this nature should also be increased to complete primary schools for fifth and sixth grades, because after graduating at the age of four, it seems more difficult than ascending to the sky to find a career under today's unreasonable social system. This is something that the Chinese Education Department should strive for.</p>
<p>As for the parents, they can also jointly request the school authorities to explain the reasons for such a large increase in fees.</p>
<p>In short, schools should understand the difficulties of families, and parents should also understand the situation and difficulties of the school (referring to some schools that are truly running schools). If everyone can understand each other, understand each other, and then develop the effect of helping each other, and overcome the difficulties of today, that is the best policy. As for those who only care about the interests of a few private individuals and act arbitrarily, then we should unceremoniously use collective power to sanction them!</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(9) A Strange Farmer</p>
<p>But the gauze problem could not be solved like this. Begonia was always extremely distressed by his face, which had been mutilated like a monster. According to his wishes, he really didn't want to walk out of Li's Village with this ugly face exposed. But Old Master Wu had another opinion, believing that if a person covered a large piece of gauze on their face, the appearance would inevitably be too mysterious. It would be very easy to attract attention in normal times, let alone in this time of chaotic soldiers and horses and drastic changes in the situation.</p>
<p>"In case people in the team see you as a spy, it will be too late to explain!" The nearly seventy-year-old uncle kept rubbing his dry hands that looked like chicken feet as he said.</p>
<p>Begonia tied and untied the piece of gauze left over from three years ago on his face dozens of times. Until the very moment before setting off, he decided to listen to his uncle's advice and discarded the gauze. He only pulled the brim of his felt hat down extra low to cover the upper part of his face.</p>
<p>A broken mule cart carried him. After traveling for most of the day, they arrived at Waguanji near the canal.</p>
<p>From here to Cangxian Station on the Jinpu Railway, there were still about thirty miles to go. It was obviously impossible to finish the journey that day, so Begonia followed his cousin's suggestion and went into an inn to rest together.</p>
<p>The inns in small northern towns are always very low and dark. It happened to be near dusk again. The waiter walked into the room carrying a kerosene lamp. In the dim, gray light, he suddenly saw Begonia's appearance after taking off his hat and was almost so frightened that he dropped the lamp in his hand.</p>
<p>"What do you two want to eat?" The waiter ignored Begonia, who was wearing a long gown, and instead asked Wu Da, who was wearing short clothes and shorts. He was obviously extremely frightened by that ugly face.</p>
<p>"First bring a plate of smoked meat. Is it okay to have thirty thin pancakes?" Wu Da asked his brother, while lighting a cigarette and putting it in his mouth to smoke. (139)</p>
