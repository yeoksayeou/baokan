<h3>羅斯福對日提質問　增兵越南用意安在　要求迅速予以明白答覆　認日此舉足為談判障礙</h3>
<p>合衆社三日華盛頓電　羅斯福總統昨日宣布、渠巳詢問日本政府為何派遺遠東與維希協定數目之海陸空軍至越南、總統告新聞記者謂、國務卿副戚爾斯巳以此項要求轉達華盛頓之日本使者、以詢問日本遺軍至越南之目的與用意、羅斯福總統稱、渠自然不能承認日本遣軍目的、乃係執行警察工作、因越南目前極為平安也、總統稱、該項請求並不予時間上之限制、但渠希望日本能於短時期內答覆、當總統答覆各記者所詢日本局勢時、羅斯福總統會回顧美日談判係於四月間開始、而美國之目標在於維持全太平洋之永久和平、渠稱、當談判似有進展時、美國亦企圖不作任何遠反此項和平目標之行動、因此日本於與維希作極簡單之談判後、即於六月問派遣軍隊至越南、渠對此舉極為驚奇、渠稱、法日間當時巳對軍隊之數目亦已妥協、維希之所以同意者、僅因該項軍隊之數目毫無能力、以作任何其他行動也、又據美政府當局聲稱、羅斯福總統已由數方獲得情報、謂日本於最近派遣大批軍隊至越為、並有多數之軍隊尙在途中云、羅斯福總統對所詢若日本進入泰國、美國海加何處置問題、置之不答、渠不以言語說明、但表示渠以為日軍在越南之行動、為繼續華盛頓談判之阻礙、</p>
<p>路透社三日華盛頓電國務副卿威爾斯、昨日招待新聞記者時稱、羅斯福總統已向日本提出若于條問話、而期待迅速之答覆、此等問話並非哀的美頓書云、威爾斯不尤討論此等問話之性質、據外交觀察家之意見、其中殆包括日軍在越與對泰之行動有何理由、務望說明一條、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社二日華盛頓電美國當局頃宜布、美國對日談判立塲堅定不移、此項立塲已詳見國務卿赫爾日前所致日代表備忘錄、實際上談判已告結束、國務副卿威爾斯昨日所由接見日方代表者、其動機乃在要求日方說明該國海陸空軍在越南方面集中情形而已、又據消息讓通人士談稱、威爾斯雖曾謂美國所提備忘錄、並非一種哀的美頓書、但日本復文如仍不得要領、則其後果如何、不言可喻、此外、威爾斯並會言及日本復文即可提出、可見危機即可分曉、而「神經戰」亦可告一段落矣、</p>
<p>路透社三日華盛頓電據昨日此間所聞、國務卿赫爾現稍感寒疾、未能參加羅斯福總統所召集關於太平洋為局之會議、故以國務副卿威爾期代表列席、</p>
<p>羅斯福召軍政領袖　檢討遠東一般局勢</p>
<p>合衆社三日華盛頓電羅斯福總統於昨午會晤渠之戰爭內閣各要員、據白宮秘書歐萊稱、該項會議之召集、為「審核」性質、檢討一般的遼東局勢、國務副卿威爾斯亦參加會議、顯係報告渠於是晨與日本使節談判之結果、出席會議之人員於會議結束後離白宮時、均拒絕作任何批評、羅斯福總統事後即與前美國駐法國大使蒲立特同餐、查昨日參加會議之各要人、包括陸長史汀生海長諾克斯等諸人、</p>
<p>日美談話歷半小時　東京覆文迄未發出</p>
<p>合衆社三日華盛頓電　遠東危機仍在繼續處於不安之形勢中、國務副卿威爾斯砟與日大使野村特使來栖會談達三十五分鐘、事後野村告人、「彼等之晤面，祇由威爾斯氏侃侃而言，吾人則默默靜聽而已，」歡察家相信，威爾期曾要求日本早日答覆美國在上週所提出之美國基本原則、渠並曾繼續詢問關於外傳日軍向越南之移動、國務院發言人稱、威爾斯在羅斯福總統授意之下、邀請兩日使至國務院、俾為總統咨詢若干日本政府之情形、野村於晨十時十五分抵國務院時稱、赫爾致日之牒文、刻正在東京愼重考慮中、覆文尙未送達華盛頓、或詢以尙有成功機會否、來栖答稱「然、余不能輕易放棄此機會、」來栖又告新聞記者稱、且前傳誦一時之日首相東條演詞、實為報道失實、東條之演說並非充滿挑戰語氣一如所傳、來栖稱該語應譯為「歐洲國家在東方　　」　以對付他國之舉動，必須加以消除、　前此之報告則謂、東條氏會稱、英美兩　必須被驅出遠東、野村告　　記者謂、日本願在可能範圍內避免戰爭、野村云、「戰爭不能解決任何事宜、吾人可謂此乃和戰關鍵、惟戰爭對此並無裨益、吾人殊無不以外交方式解決此事之理由」、</p>
<p>康納萊答覆日首相　維護權益不辭一戰</p>
<p>路透社三日弗洛里　卡州洛爾蓋勃爾斯電　參院外委會主席康納萊昨在此間之美國儲蓋與借款聯盟會　中演說、謂余今向日首相發誓、吾人有種種權利、並不懼為之作奮鬥、倘使日本　戰及必須作戰、則將發見吾人在太平洋中駐有類能射擊之海軍，以上郵為余對日首相之答覆也、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社三日紐約電名記者雷蒙克勒披、今日在紐約世界電報發表一文稱、美日僵局、　臨山窮水盡之竟、雙方立塲南轅北轍、可謂難以妥洽、又據紐約太陽報載華盛頓專電稱、華盛頓方面莫不以悲觀態度住視遠東局勢夕推移、並已公開聲明美國已處最後立塲、不能稍有改變、日本如進一步出以侵略行動、殆必掀起戰爭、日本荀不接受美國條件、則目前之期待階段、當難延長、日本如巳不耐煩、則決裂似可立見云、此外羅斯福總統突自溫泉返京後、會一再與海陸軍當局磋商大局、益足證明美國在遠更方面之海陸軍、業已引滿待發矣、</p>
<p>東京鼓吹日泰聯防　南進野心昭然若揭</p>
<p>路透社三日東京電　「中外商業新聞」今日主張日泰聯防、共衛泰國、謂若泰國不能單獨維持中立、則日本應以任何代價、强令泰國為之、因泰國乃共榮圈中之一節也、泰國不應獲以中立為限、但應在日本東亞程序中與日本合作。日本不能容許英軍開入泰國、故亟宣日泰聯防云、「報知新聞」論亦作與此同樣之論調、</p>
<p>合衆社三日曼谷電此問日本大使館發言人本日開始每週招待泰國報界時宜稱、日軍之集中越南南部、係另有用意、並非威脅泰團、發言人稱、日本對泰國並無侵略之意、反之、日本確欲援助泰國收回失地、但如泰國誤解日本之態度、則日本將不給予援助、發言人又稱、英美若不接受日本之新秩序觀念、則遠東或將發生戰爭、日本不欲戰爭、戰爭之發生全在華盛頓、羅斯福總統說話太多、日本則保持缄默、發言人解釋日本報紙最近之反泰態度、謂此乃出於誤會、但發言人對於一部份泰國報紙之反日態度、則表示不滿、發言人叉稱、泰國或將被迫而放棄其中立、一如日本在世界大戰時云、同時日大使坪上會於日本駐泰使館新任參事石井自東京抵此時、訪問泰總理、</p>
<p>路透社三日盤谷電據聞英國駐盤谷公使館、籃於還東不定之國際局勇、已勸告無留居必要之央籍婦需及男子、老慮目前離去泰國之適當性、</p>
<p>遠東戰事一觸卽發　美艦隊正集中待命</p>
<p>路透社三日佛傑尼亞州諾福克電　美海次已特昨向此間商會演說、謂吾國海軍造艦程序之以最高速度趕進、主要原因係由於（一）太平洋爆發之迫切危險、及（二）國在大四年之已作行動、吾國家及人民雖木在戰塲作戰、質已在戰中、太平洋之火藥箱現正等候一星之火、耶將在地球東部四分之一遍行爆發、吾海軍對日本力量、並不估値過低、太平洋萬一發生可遺憾之粉擾，共規模將決不微小、吾海軍已有充分之準備以資應付云、</p>
<p>路透社三日東京電　「讀賣新聞」今日在封面載社論、謂美國殆信集其海軍於太平洋即足制日、女知美國艦隊百分之八十泊於太平洋中、不啻「解除動員」、而德國因此可獲黃金機會、在大西洋作充分之活動、「讀賣新聞」之海軍記者認為美海軍現集於太平洋者佔其全力白分之八十左右、內有戰艦七八艘、航空母艦三艘、重巡洋艦約十二艘、驅逐艦五十餘艘·潛艇三十餘艘·輔助艦數亦甚夥、現信此諸艦皆在夏威夷待命、此外尙有重巡洋艦兩艘·輕巡洋艦一艘·驅逐艦數艘、潛艇與輔助艦若干艘、泊於馬尼刺、僅餘戰艦三艘與其他隊伍泊於西部海濱根據地、海軍記者評論日美談判、深信美國欲維持太平洋和平至一九四六年、而至兩洋艦隊完成、英美現一面加緊ABCD又日之包圍、一面注視遠東之蘇聯艦隊、希望拉之加入ABCD營壘、目前之疑問為蘇聯旣與日不訂有中立協定、是否仍將受英美之玩弄、遠東之蘇聯海軍估計共有艦百餘艘、計巡洋艦一·驅逐艦五，潛艇約六十左右、潛艇供應艦二砲艦魚雷艇埋雷艦特務艦各數艘、英美尤注意蘇聯之潛艇與飛機、觀察太平洋之局勢、足徽日本現受ABCD包國嚴重之威脅、美國之加緊此包圍綫、蓋圖實現其不光明之計謀、惟日本現正鎮靜注視大局、而對於帝國之海陸軍深抱信任、尤其因首相東條海相島田曾在最近議會中保證日政府之充分準備業已完成也、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>英艦隊開來遠東</h3>
<p>上月十三日美國曾之通過中立法修正案，是近頃國際間一件大事。中立法的精神，固早已名存實亡，但却始終梗阻其間，使美國不能更進一步與作戰的各民主國共同分袒反侵略的神聖任務。該法案的通過，在消極方面衝破了前此美人惟恐戰禍波及的恐怖心理，在積極方面美國載運戰具的商輪獲得自由出入戰區，且可以共武裝直接抵抗軸心方面的剽襲。此外更重耍者，則為大西洋的護航任務，美國將分擔一部分責任，减輕英艦隊的重負，因而英艦隊之由大西洋分調一部分以增援地中海與遠束都成為可能。是以在美國修正中立法的同時，英首相邱吉爾卽曾表示英國將大為增强遠東的海軍實力，一般推測，都認為括有强有力軍艦的英艦隊不久可望出現於太平洋與印度洋。果然，距此不及兩旬，適值遠東局勢正屆最後關頭之際，以三萬五千噸新型主力艦威爾斯親王號為旗艦的英遠東艦隊，已於隔昨開抵遠東不落要塞新加坡來增防了。</p>
<p>目前的太平洋問題，是由美國單獨與日本折衝，英國站在與美共進退的地位，但是縱觀近頃英方動向，顯然比較華盛頓尤為積極血急切，例如美當局迄未透露如何應付遠東可能發生的戰爭，邱吉爾則明白宣示英將在一小時內踵美宣戰，美方近僅從事於撤僑撤軍的消極準備，而英國在遠東的各屬領，從緬甸馬來半島以至澳洲，都已入於戰時景象；這自然是英國領土首當其衝，如果不幸發生戰事必先在英日之間爆發，更因為戰略上的理由，至少在戰事初期，英方所負責任更較重大。現在美太平洋艦隊主力遠在三千浬外的珍珠港，從那裏直到太平洋西岸之間並沒有可資利用的海軍根據地，在美艦未能開臨赴援之前的一二週問，西太平洋的防禦不能不靠英方的海上實力單獨負責，則於此際把一隻强大艦隊開進堅固完美而只是缺乏軍艦的新加坡要塞，自然英方所不容已的事。</p>
<p>無論日方人士如何故意表示輕蔑，ABCD陣綫的實力，毫不誇張的來說，至少在遠束是强大無敵的。陸上的力量，僅僅中國一國已足與日本形成平衡，空中的力量，則英美遠束空軍的總和已證明在質量雙方都超過日本，在海上，僅就美日之間比較，其現有總勢力之比據日人自稱為一〇〇對八一（？），雖然美方不能不分顧大西洋的警備，但却始終維持着太平洋艦隊對日本全部艦隊較佔優勢。所以就實刀來講，日方絕對無倖可徼，不過在地理的因素上，却稍佔有先天的便利，這對於將以海上決戰為主體的未來遠東大戰，無疑是個最可注意的問題。美國太平洋艦隊的海軍雖具有龐大實力和便於遠出作戰的續航力，而目前危機的焦點在南中國海和越南半島附近，遠處數千里外的美艦主力顯屬鞭長莫及，卽便趕來赴援亦須在戰略上計出萬全，纔能免蹈日俄戰爭中俄國波羅的海艦隊在對馬一役的覆轍。但如果ABCD陣綫能在馬來半島緬甸荷印等地作堅强抵抗，在南中國海中復有足資應變的强力海軍，則戰峪形勢卽當完全不同，彼時日軍當在上述各地遇到堅强抵抗，更在美艦隊相機西開之下，使日本陷入背腹受敵的窘境。最近英方在南洋各地之積極增防，誠屬一種明智的未雨綢繆，而强力艦隊的大舉東開，充實民治陣錢在南太平洋的海上實力，尤足使遠東攻守之勢為之改觀。</p>
<p>威爾斯親王號與喬治第五號同為英國最新式的主力艦，曾參預今夏丹麥海峽對德艦俾斯麥號一役，今竟開來新加坡增防，足見英當局對於遠東危局重視的一斑。與日万最新式的主力艦長門陸奧兩艦比較，則英艦無論噸位，速力，裝甲，防禦都遠出其上，只是所裝主砲為十四吋砲十門，不像日兩艦之裝有十六时砲八門，但據專家的意見，此種十四吋砲火的穿澈力與優越性　，較之裝有八門或九門十六吋砲者有過之無不及，不過日方連年秘密造艦，其最新式的日新高松兩主力艦傳已落成下水，不過其性能如何還是個未知數　，何况日本連年物資短絀，鋼鐵奇缺，其造艦程序是無論如何不能與英美任何一國相抗衡的。威爾斯親王號之外究有幾許艦艇同時開來現仍未悉，照海軍的慣例，每一艘重型主力艦必有若干巡洋艦驅逐艦之類為之輔助，則卽使此次柬開英艦主力艦僅此一艘，亦必有若干輔助艦共同開來，形成一個强大作戰單位。目前德義海軍殘餘已不足齒數，大西洋的誰航所需又僅驅逐艦與輕巡洋艦之類，且有美國分任其勞，假如遠東局勢有變，相信英方必能以更多的海軍主力東開增防。</p>
<p>現在美日談判雖形勢危殆，但並未完全絕望，如果日方不準備過分冒險的話，正當領會英方這一應變準備的警告意義，速作懸崖勒馬的打算。為了有備無患起見，珍珠港的美艦隊亦當與英採平行措置，則無論未來局勢安危何似，在西太平洋的戰略上，民治陣綫已握有顚撲不破的有利地位，而且也更足以促進日方的憬悟。</p>

<p>德國內部雖多深切的不滿，可是勢分力弱，並不能聯合作有效的反抗。天主敎徒仇視共產黨徒，普魯士帝制派擁護一霍亨查倫皇室，而巴伐里亞君主派則擁護威德爾斯巴皇室，這兩派與急進派和民治派又彼此水火不相容，民治派也以為自己的前途絲毫無望。</p>
<p>德國人雖希望和平，可是他們所希望的是現在就可獲得勝利的和平，而非戰畋的和平。他們還記得上次歐戰後的和平敎訓怎樣，更知道這一次戰敗後的情况，必將更不如前。他們知道，除了英國的和平條件之外，歐洲大陸戰敗各國的人民都在等候報復呢。</p>
<p>德國大多數人的第一個希望是德國不要戰敗，而推翻現政權猶在其次。德國人若作進一步之想，必然要問「我們果將以什麼去代替現政府呢？假使我們在現政府之下獲勝，就無法加以推翻。假使我們把現政府推翻，就無法取勝呀。」</p>
<p>德國人都喜歡向比較樂觀方面想。可是對俄戰爭的情形怎麼樣？美國會不會對德開戰？何時方可得到和半？我們會戰敗麼？這許多一概不要去想。祇有工作，排隊等候，睡眠，活過去吧。</p>
<p>使德國人初次感覺到戰爭的實際情况者，殆莫過於對俄戰爭。德國早前所獲的勝利，莫不勢如破竹，流血無多。德軍進攻克里特島的時候，我剛巧在一個村莊裏，消息傳來有兩個本村少年陣亡了。（未完）</p>

<h3>日美之和戰莫決　金市之上落無常</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗市、徘徊轉漲、價已盤出一萬五千元大關外，美日談判已瀕破裂、利多利空莫衷一是、美金票升至三十元關左右、名方人心一致帶堅、櫁面上供求尚屬力敵、天元軋進八百三十兩，滙票商及證劵號各進三百五十兩左右、公和時和明豊進胃亦强、但成記順源各出四百數十兩、永成出五百兩以上、祥和聯興同康永各出二百兩光景、致價由一萬四千三百元步升至一萬五千五百元、旋即回下、收市軋升七百七十元、全日交易共二萬零九百六十兩、飾金盤升九十元、紋銀尚平、</p>
<p>現金衝出萬五千元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）九點開市為一萬四千四百元、比上日收價低三十元、俄見天元祥和證券號現金號合盛等買進、立見回升三百五十元、升至一萬四千七百五十元、成記萬禮明豊證劵號津幫祥和祥興永來力售、頓見步瀉四百五十元、遜至一萬四千三百元、及聞美票步升、外滙軟化、引起買風、天元祥興永明豊公和時和滙票商證劵號接踵收吸、價步見上升、午刻尤銳、突出一萬五千元外，逹一萬五千三百元、午收一萬五千二百八十元、下午開市即抬高二百二十元、為一萬五千五百元、天元宏慶永誠逹來力售、永成傾賣、價頓步瀉五百五十元、降至一萬四千九百五十元、滙票商證劵號及合盛公和明豊先後來力進、提升四百元、逹一萬五千三百五十元、又為永成祥興永祥和天元力售、回下至一萬五千零五十元、天元復進、德大進一萬五千二百元收市、比上日復漲七百七十元、有一千二百元差度、現金號之本牌金、門市售價一萬五千四百元、收進比售出低一千元、</p>
<p>銀樓飾金亦見軋升</p>
<p>銀樓飾金每兩兌出價、大同行及新同行均於晨初掛升三十元、後再步漲八十元、兩次至一千五百八十元、即回下至一千五百四十元、最後一千五百六十元、（收進減一百五十元）、軋升九十元、紋銀仍掛二十二元、黑市十七八元、</p>
<h3>美鈔會出三十元　黑匯帶緊</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况，中央與滙豊兩掛牌勿更、英美商十四家外銀行曁華行小　　價亦平、英美滙黑黑市續緊更銳、乃美金票突出三十元外、進口洋行求結心切、華商多頭乘機硬扳貴價、致英滙已軟至一辦士二五或可結、美金三元三七五有不准申請之進口洋行扒結、上半日內迄少成交、價比前日收市、英美均軋緊一二五、下午週三無市、</p>
<p>昨日外幣市况、英美金鎊隨現金價猛漲二十元、英金票劇漲十元、美金票會出三十元關、最後為二十九元八角、比上日軋升一元三角、香港票降一角、坎拿大票及菲列濱票均趨漲勢、日金票及朝鮮票軍票等均趨低落、前者為二元七角半、中者為二元五角、後者為三元四角五分、</p>
<p>香港三日（週三）　、今晨滙市開盤呆滯異常、各滙仍無榮辱、下午週三無市、</p>
<p>天津三日（週三）電、今晨滙市開盤告平、各滙均站原盤、並無上落、</p>
<h3>偏是黃金作崇　紗市隨之盤旋</h3>
<p>紗市趨勢靜而定、但人心大都看疲、因套賣之額充足也、惟大戶鑒於金雙馬期紗及黃金均堅昂仍收進、在多頭方面掙扎、所以廻旋力量異常堅强、目下將其他交易所之紗價比較、變馬獨　、然變馬市盤依然渙散乏力、二十支雙馬高價為二千四百八十五元、低價為二千三百九十五元、午後開盤即跳上升、首盤價為二千五百六十五元、然高價一現、即刻向下、跌到二千四百五十五元、但取所引紗市行情、步開步升、又隨之回昂至二千四百八十五元、惟　面仍係空頭、又鬆至二千四百三十五元、收盤價為二千四百四十三元、塲外四十五元、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開市態甚平、首盤價為二千四百二十元、少頃因空頭扒補、升至二千四百五十元、嗣後取引所開後稍下、空方又復活動、賣氣較盛、跌至二千三百九十五元、但價格旣疲、買戶興緻濃、又漲至二千四百四十元、盤旋為時甚久、迨至收盤、以黃金上漲、空頭抵補、市盤步步上昂至二千四百七十二元收盤、查半日間成交統計二千九百五十包、</p>
<p>金變馬期貨、由續跌而復振、形勢依然飄盪靡定、蓋以邇來國際間之趨向莫測、消息之錯綜複雜、最感捨取兩難、故觀走勢殊無側重跡象、當上午開出、雖洋花績昂、而廠單則先趨疲、故期紗經一般憑藉現紗者之左右、十二月份僅為二四八〇元開盤、一月份二五五〇元開出、已見平定、二月份二六三〇元初做先帶硬態、迨至二盤時、適因取引所與廠單又復徘而下、多方益見顧忌、逐由金號與證券幫之傾吐下、乃一度　低至全日中之低盤、不料將近午收時、突以金市驟然上升、現紗與期紗均相依而上、拾至午收各月期約升三四十元許、午後以取　所之堅漲、使多方當為挺定、市氣於散戶之吸收下、仍見微漲、第以局勢所繫、總非十分堅穩、全日上落結果、各月期約好二十餘元至五十元不等、茲列表於後、</p>
<p>十一月　一月　二月</p>
<p>開盤　二四八〇·〇　二五五〇·〇　二六三〇·〇</p>
<p>最高　二五一五·〇　二六〇〇·〇　二六七〇·〇</p>
<p>最低　二四三八·〇　二五一〇·〇　二五九五·〇</p>
<p>收盤　二五〇〇·〇　二六〇〇·〇　二六三五·〇</p>
<p>比較　漲四〇·〇　漲五〇·〇　漲三四·〇</p>
<h3>現棉市態平定</h3>
<p>現棉情况平平、但黃金趨昂、貨主憲態較見安平、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、市况因有華爾街買進及紡織業買進而漲、昨日收盤價格較之上日各漲十四五磅因左右、</p>
<p>印度棉市先因棉商套賣而跌、但續後又因大量投機者買進、及帶遠東情勢並不十分惡劣而漲、結果昨日收盤　價格各漲三四絲比左右、</p>
<h3>公債雖見回漲　局勢依然求總</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市頗有震溋、但未減其舉棋不定之態、上午一漲七八角、下午驟跌八九角、足徵人心異常恍惚、在此消息龐雜之際、多空變方均感無可措手之苦、下午外商金融界又有利空謠言、如香港滙　銀行遷新加坡、人心更覺不振、公債本在虛軟之際、更何堪謠言之襲擊、昨午前在聯益同益協興元公茂等緩緩抬價中、漸漸趨高、丙種見過六十八元七角、但以同順生興賣出而未能立定、午後人心忽虛、生興繼續賣出、丙種開盤忽打破八元為六十七元八角、嗣後因同康聚鑫略有需要、回上二三角、結果尚高起一二角至六角不等、丁種於午後未有傲開、成交約共一百四五十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交南洋兄弟烟草公司股二百股、價為三十九元五角、</p>
<p>衆業股市開盤稍高、嗣又逐形下挫、蓋買戶缺乏支持力、賣方見高即售也、結果兩種股票價格與上日收盤價相彷、</p>
<h3>疋頭略一盤旋　不久騰踴而上</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市盤旋、上午鬆落、午後步步上騰、結果較上日粗布漲九角至一元、細布斜紋漲一元左右、漂染布一部份漲一二元、花蝶粗布農開跌五角、　步小至九十元零五角、午收又回升至九十一元七角半、午後由九十二元上漲至九十三元收盤、較上日軋漲五角、本街成交粗布藍布綫呢絨布等三百餘件、浙東幫辦粗布色布等一百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　最盤市氣平庸、售盤均趨下挫、後市因金價升騰、利多謠言又熾、回升亦速、取引所彩球細布期貨本月份收盤價八十六元、一月份八十九元、俱較前日漲一元、二月份九十一元、漲一元半、現貨市塲之龍頭細布廠單上午在八十九元廻旋甚久、下午亦升至九十元零五角收盤、</p>
<h3>粉價定四十元</h3>
<p>—外加費用二角—</p>
<p>昨洋粉市形穩定、因工部局已開始分配實消戶、並經公布四十元加費二角之平價公賣價格、一部份實消已不向市上吸收、即散客實消亦不復觀望而隨市問津、執貨者旣無抬價企圖之機會、亦無統制低賣之杞憂、故亦隨市出售、因此市况大為安定、西棧登記金龍已站住四十元左右之價格、最高至四十一元、惟已准轉口之東棧各粉因有客囤出路、售價仍須五十元外、麩皮祗開三金錢小包五十四元半、約二三百包、小麦存到兩枯、杜客麦均喊七十三四元云、</p>
<h3>食油雜糧　囤戶依然把持</h3>
<p>雜糧油餅市况、昨仍一致激昂、良以實銷尚稱不寂、勢貨者咸圖把持、故行情繼續上升、結果食油又漲五元至十元、黃豆苞米俱昂一二元、統市售開大連豆油五十桶、江北生油三百聽、另有二十桶、大有廠清油六百擔、日華廠菜油二百餘桶、大昌新廠菜油一百擔、立德泰山大生廠菜油各二　　、天津新金元六百包又陳金元三百包、又青豆三百包、苞米現貨二千餘包期貨五百多　、</p>
<h3>食糖囤戶心虛　雖猛跌交易猶清</h3>
<p>昨糖市因　銷更見清寂、而存底反見日增、因此囤戶極為必虛、乘市出售、價乃續跌十餘元至七元不一、公司期貨三四粗白本月十日期價為一百九十六元至九十元　小七元、二十日期二百九十四元、寛降十五元、現貨二四粗白十一月份入口二百零四元至一百九十五元半、下午九十六元、七元、四元半、小八元半、十月份一百九十八元。九十四元、下午九十二三元、小十元、九月份一百九十七元。九十三元、下午八十八元、八十五元、八月份一百八十三元、下午同價、港粗一百七十六元、小七元、荷赤一百六十八元、六十三元、下午六十四元、小十元、</p>
<h3>香烟可以搬運　有方印者獨俏</h3>
<p>香烟依然續漸增高、蓋廠方因原料缺乏、派銷同業之貨、不能大量供給、再以當局物價限制、香烟一項不在此例、故執有貨者待觀善價出售、邇因有搬出證發出、客幫紛向市塲搜售方印各貨、為因茂泰各機工人發生罷工、存與上項之貨、不能出清故現貨大都扳俏、價如大英牌每箱二千九百九十元、老刀牌方印二千八百五十元、仙女牌一千七百九十元、五華牌一千八百八十元、品海牌二千一百十元、均比上日趨昂、日用品如火柴皂燭等燭等暫度平靜、稍覺俏俐、因廠方有加價消息、</p>
<h3>粉乾上漲太鉅　自是不能不跌</h3>
<p>綫粉干前因提漲過甚、如龍口粉竟達四百六七十元、可謂極盡高昂之能事、近以貨價大都轉降、此為雖係冬令當銷之品、亦雖例外、價乃步軟、前後已跌去數十元、昨市龍口粉售四百元、餘照退、</p>
<h3>黑鐵坯子突露鋒芒　原扎須萬一千元光景</h3>
<p>黑鐵坯子、因福建幫羣起搜羅、加以香港來路又見中斷、本街底貨單薄蕭條之市象中、突見光芒、以致喊價又起漲風、查昨如二千磅貨原扎須一萬一千元光景、二百磅花色每箱更沽一千一百元至一千一百五十元不等、較之前市又昂昇逹一千元及一百五十元之鉅、</p>

<h3>莫斯科的今昔</h3>
<p>— 何凱</p>
<p>近年來莫斯科在形態上變化之速是足以驚人的。西歐的都市經過十年或二十年後再度訪問絕少能看出變化的痕跡。這是因為那些都市大都早已建設完竣的原故。</p>
<p>可是莫斯科却是從一個大村落一躍而變成近代的所謂社會主義的中心都市，其變化之速自然是非一般人想像所及的。</p>
<p>革命發生後即亡命於國外，經過十餘年後再同到故鄉莫斯科的俄國作家顧普林，當他站在該市的中心時，不禁大聲喊道：「這不是莫斯科！」事實上莫斯科已經完全另換面目，使過去認識它的人無法辨認它了。</p>
<p>十餘年前莫斯科僅有二百萬左右人口，至今日這已激增為四百五十萬了。由此可見莫斯科在這短期間已膨脹到如何程度。在城市中心的大街上過夫所有鱗次櫛比的低矮的肉店蔬菜店，現在都一掃而光，代之而矗立的是歐洲最大的十層樓大飯店「莫期科飯店」，及用暗灰色的大理石造成的人民委員會大廈。莫斯科的「南京路」—高爾基路己將兩旁的建築物挨次破壞，將馬路大形擴充，把彎曲的路改成直路，而在路的中心又築起方塲，總之已完全把莫期科改成現代化的都市了。</p>
<p>蘇聯又在莫斯科建築第一條地下鐵路，它是以全世界規模最大著稱，最深處竟有七十公尺之深。各車站的內部均面積宏大而圓柱林立，誠不負「地下王宮」的別號。</p>
<p>形成W形貢流該市的莫斯科河水量稀少，因此當局巳建設莫斯科，伏爾加運河，將水量豐富的伏爾加河水導入。因此到今日莫斯科已逐漸具備大都市的面目了。</p>
<p>莫斯科的改造是根據着一九三五年通過的「莫斯科改造十年計劃」。按照這計劃，新莫斯科將設法保存曾經歷史之發展的莫斯科之基本輪廓，同時對街道及方塲則加以根本的改造，以便建成近代化的城市。</p>
<p>舊莫斯科的面積是二萬八千五百公頃，而新莫斯科的面積是六萬公頃，差不多擴大二倍半。而莫斯科近郊也將附屬於莫斯科市，建設簇新的一萬六千公頃之都市。</p>
<p>不過大莫斯科的周圍將殘留直徑十公里的森林地，而在沒有森林的地方也將新設森林地帶。至於住宅還旣不擬建造觸目驚心如紐約一般的摩天樓，也不擬建築供一家族居住的二層樓房或平房，它預備建造的是精緻的六層至八層的公寓。</p>
<p>作為這十年計劉之一環的地下鐵路己於數年前完成，而其他各項計劃也正在着着實現之中。不幸在這時候戰爭突然爆發，使莫斯科無暇完成這計劃。倘使能再假以數年的話，莫斯科一定已變成世界上最新式的近代都市了。</p>

<h3>環境</h3>
<p>— 高掦</p>
<p>我們常聽見人家說，生長在好的環境裏，可以培養出有用的人才；在壞的環境裏，就能造成社會的敗類。</p>
<p>其實，這話也很含糊，到底「好」與「壞」的標準在什麼地方呢？拿什麼來當水平呢？我想在今天，至少該在這兩個原則下來分別好壞的。</p>
<p>一，要對得起國家，民族，人類，而一舉一動，也都不能脫離了道一個範圍。</p>
<p>二，要積極的改造，而不是消極的忍受。</p>
<p>這樣，我們先把「好「壞」的分別確定了下來，只要不離開這兩個原則，那末，環境的「苦」，「甜」是沒有多大關係的——只要不違背上面的兩點。</p>
<p>因此，在某一種人看來，跳舞，賭博，酗酒，嫖，這環境是好的；而在冰天雪地，狂風暴雨下戰鬭，在他們看來這環境太壞了。其實，我們說：前面一種是昏庸的人們，是社會的蛀蟲，後面一種才是為了大家的生存而在向環境肉搏。這是為了國家，民族的，也是積極的。</p>
<p>當然，我們不否認，環境能夠影響一個人的思想，行為，醫如：喜歡賭錢的父母，常把孩子帶在身邊看賭，結果，是造成了孩子們好賭的心理與行動。再像兩個不同待遇的孩子處在同一個家庭里，它便會養成一個苦孩子去偷竊的行為。即使是成人，也老是這樣，在同一個職業範圍裏，或是一種生活圈子裏，它能造成某一種人，所謂「近朱者赤，近墨者黑」，它的道理也就在此！</p>
<p>可是，我們不能承認，只有環境支配人的說法，而忽略了人也可以支配環境的能耐，甚至創造環境的偉大力量。第一，我們先該根據上面的原則，把「好」「壤」分別出來，這就先得靠自己的認識來區別自己所處的環境，而不使它顚倒黑白，迷糊了頭腦。第二，我們處在不論怎樣惡劣的環境裏，我們該打定主意，它正像船在海洋裏航行時，需要一個意志堅定的「把舵手」一樣，我們要駕駛環境，不要被環境駕得勝了雲，而不知所往！</p>
<p>所以，我們說，我們要做克服環境，利用環境，支配環境的主人，決不要做環境的傀儡，環境的偶像！而更重要的是：</p>
<p>——我們必須要做創造環境的戰鬭者！</p>

<h3>香箋淚公演前</h3>
<p>— 蔣旂</p>
<p>「香箋淚」今晚由中旅在天宮演出了，這消息帶給了我很大的欣慰。</p>
<p>在私誼上我耍為舊友陶秦兄的處女作公演而慶幸，而史使我欣慰的是，在連年鬧着劇本荒的中國劇壇上，如今，又增添了一位新而有力的劇作者</p>
<p>它的取村與寫作技巧，自有賢明的觀衆加以批判，母庸我先在這裏介紹，但我要介紹的乃是陶秦兄的謙虛的寫作態度與努力克服挫折的勇氣。</p>
<p>不管它演出成敗如何，但是我知道作者已紋盡了他的心血。「香箋淚」脫稿得很早，會幾次三番地重寫過，又徵集了許多朋友們的意見而一再增刪過，這雖說是一個劇作家應有的精神，但，能夠有這種精神的作家，就我所知，尙嫌不多</p>
<p>劇本會一再送出，而一再被拒，這也許因為和寫作容或有若干疵點，但也許因為該劇本係出諸於無名小卒之手。然而現在，終於給演出了，這固然得歸功於槐秋先生對於無名劇作的不加輕視，但陶秦兄的努力克服挫折的勇氣也同樣值得我們表掦的。</p>
<p>「香箋淚」這次由中旅鄭重演出由闊別已久的唐若靑女士主演，由名導演卜萬蒼先生導演，除了我舊友感到無上欣慰之外，更希望他能永存寫此時的態度與精神，並在不久將來，給我們更偉大更有利於我們民族的劇作。</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Poses Questions to Japan Regarding Troop Increase in Vietnam, Demands Prompt and Clear Response, Sees Japanese Action as Hindrance to Negotiations</h3>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 3rd - President Roosevelt announced yesterday that he had questioned the Japanese government as to why it had dispatched a number of land, sea, and air forces to Vietnam that exceeded the number stipulated in the agreement with Vichy. The President told reporters that Under Secretary of State Welles had conveyed this request to the Japanese envoy in Washington, inquiring about the purpose and intention of Japan's dispatch of troops to Vietnam. President Roosevelt stated that he naturally could not accept that the Japanese troop dispatch was for police work, as Vietnam is currently very peaceful. The President said that the request did not have a time limit, but he hoped Japan would respond within a short period. When the President answered reporters' questions about the situation in Japan, President Roosevelt recalled that the U.S.-Japan negotiations began in April, and the U.S. objective was to maintain lasting peace throughout the Pacific. He said that when negotiations seemed to be progressing, the U.S. also attempted to avoid any actions that would violate this peace objective. Therefore, he was extremely surprised that Japan dispatched troops to Vietnam in June after very simple negotiations with Vichy. He said that the French and Japanese sides had already compromised on the number of troops at that time, and Vichy agreed only because the number of troops was incapable of any other action. U.S. government authorities also claimed that President Roosevelt had received information from various sources stating that Japan had recently dispatched a large number of troops to Vietnam, and many more troops were en route. President Roosevelt declined to answer the question of what the U.S. would do if Japan entered Thailand. He did not explain in words, but indicated that he believed the Japanese military's actions in Vietnam were an obstacle to continuing the Washington negotiations.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 3rd - Under Secretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that President Roosevelt had posed several questions to Japan and expected a prompt response. These questions are not a "note of ultimatum." Welles did not further discuss the nature of these questions. According to diplomatic observers, they likely included a request to explain the rationale behind the Japanese military's actions in Vietnam and towards Thailand.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 2nd - U.S. authorities have recently announced that the U.S. stance on negotiations with Japan remains firm and unwavering. This stance has been detailed in Secretary of State Hull's memorandum to the Japanese representative. In reality, the negotiations have ended. Under Secretary of State Welles' meeting with the Japanese representative yesterday was motivated by a request for Japan to explain the concentration of its land, sea, and air forces in Vietnam. According to well-informed sources, although Welles stated that the U.S. memorandum was not an ultimatum, the consequences of a non-responsive reply from Japan are self-evident. Furthermore, Welles mentioned that Japan's reply could be submitted soon, indicating that the crisis would be resolved soon, and the "war of nerves" could come to an end.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 3rd - It was learned here yesterday that Secretary of State Hull is currently suffering from a slight cold and was unable to attend President Roosevelt's meeting on the situation in the Pacific. Therefore, Under Secretary of State Welles represented him at the meeting.</p>
<p>Roosevelt Summons Military and Political Leaders to Review General Situation in the Far East</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 3rd - President Roosevelt met with key members of his war cabinet yesterday afternoon. According to White House Secretary O'Leary, the meeting was convened for "review" purposes, to examine the general situation in the Liaodong region. Under Secretary of State Welles also attended the meeting, apparently to report on the results of his morning negotiations with the Japanese envoy. Those attending the meeting refused to make any comments after leaving the White House at the end of the meeting. President Roosevelt later dined with former U.S. Ambassador to France, Bullitt. Those attending the meeting yesterday included Secretary of War Stimson and Secretary of the Navy Knox.</p>
<p>Japanese-American Talks Last Half an Hour; Tokyo's Reply Has Not Yet Been Issued</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 3rd - The Far East crisis continues to be in an uneasy state. Under Secretary of State Welles met with Japanese Ambassador Nomura and Special Envoy Kurusu for 35 minutes yesterday. Afterwards, Nomura told people, "Their meeting consisted only of Mr. Welles speaking eloquently, while we listened silently." Observers believe that Welles requested Japan to respond to the fundamental principles presented by the United States last week as soon as possible, and he also continued to inquire about the rumored movement of Japanese troops to Vietnam. A State Department spokesman said that Welles, at the direction of President Roosevelt, invited the two Japanese envoys to the State Department to consult on certain situations regarding the Japanese government. When Nomura arrived at the State Department at 10:15 a.m., he said that Hull's note to Japan was being carefully considered in Tokyo, and the reply had not yet been sent to Washington. When asked if there was still a chance of success, Kurusu replied, "Yes, I cannot easily give up this opportunity." Kurusu also told reporters that the widely circulated speech by Japanese Prime Minister Tojo was misrepresented. Tojo's speech was not as full of challenging language as reported. Kurusu said the phrase should be translated as "European countries in the East..." to deal with the actions of other countries must be eliminated. Previous reports stated that Tojo had said that Britain and the United States must be driven out of the Far East. Nomura told reporters that Japan wished to avoid war as much as possible. Nomura said, "War cannot solve anything. We can say that this is the key to war or peace, but war is of no benefit to this matter. We have no reason not to resolve this matter through diplomatic means."</p>
<p>Connally Responds to Japanese Prime Minister: Will Fight to Defend Our Rights</p>
<p>Reuters, Floiri, California, 3rd - Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said yesterday at the American Savings and Loan League convention here, "I now swear to the Japanese Prime Minister, we have all kinds of rights and are not afraid to fight for them. If Japan fights and we must fight, then they will find that we have a capable navy stationed in the Pacific. The above is my answer to the Japanese Prime Minister."</p>
<p>Havas, New York, 3rd - Renowned journalist Raymond Clapper published an article in the New York World-Telegram today stating that the U.S.-Japan stalemate is nearing its end. The positions of the two sides are diametrically opposed, making a compromise difficult. According to a Washington special dispatch in the New York Sun, Washington is viewing the developments in the Far East with pessimism and has publicly stated that the United States has reached its final position and cannot change it in the slightest. If Japan takes further aggressive actions, it will almost certainly trigger a war. If Japan does not accept U.S. conditions, then the current waiting stage will be difficult to prolong. If Japan has become impatient, then a break seems imminent. In addition, President Roosevelt's sudden return to Beijing from the hot springs after repeatedly consulting with naval and military authorities further proves that the U.S. naval and military forces in the Far East are ready to act.</p>
<p>Tokyo Promotes Japanese-Thai Joint Defense, Southward Ambitions Clearly Revealed</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd - The "Chugai Business News" argued today for a Japanese-Thai joint defense to jointly protect Thailand, saying that if Thailand cannot maintain its neutrality alone, then Japan should force Thailand to do so at any cost, because Thailand is a part of the co-prosperity sphere. Thailand should not be limited to neutrality but should cooperate with Japan in Japan's East Asian program. Japan cannot allow British troops to enter Thailand, so it is urgently advocating a Japanese-Thai joint defense. The "Hochi Shimbun" also made similar arguments.</p>
<p>United Press International, Bangkok, 3rd - A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy here today, when beginning the weekly reception for the Thai press, said that the concentration of Japanese troops in southern Vietnam has another purpose and is not a threat to Thailand. The spokesman said that Japan has no intention of invading Thailand. On the contrary, Japan wants to help Thailand recover its lost territories, but if Thailand misunderstands Japan's attitude, then Japan will not provide assistance. The spokesman also said that if Britain and the United States do not accept Japan's concept of a new order, then war may break out in the Far East. Japan does not want war; the occurrence of war depends entirely on Washington. President Roosevelt talks too much, while Japan remains silent. The spokesman explained the recent anti-Thai attitude of Japanese newspapers, saying that this was due to a misunderstanding. However, the spokesman expressed dissatisfaction with the anti-Japanese attitude of some Thai newspapers. The spokesman also said that Thailand may be forced to abandon its neutrality, as Japan did in World War I. At the same time, Japanese Ambassador Tsubogami met with the Thai Prime Minister when the new counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Thailand, Ishii, arrived here from Tokyo.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 3rd - It is heard that the British Embassy in Bangkok, due to the unstable international situation in the Far East, has advised Central-籍 women and men with no need to stay to consider the appropriateness of leaving Thailand at this time.</p>
<p>Far East War About to Break Out, U.S. Fleet Concentrating and Standing By</p>
<p>Reuters, Norfolk, Virginia, 3rd - The U.S. Secretary of the Navy Admeral Yesterday spoke to the Chamber of Commerce here, saying that our country's naval shipbuilding program is proceeding at the highest speed, mainly due to (1) the imminent danger of an outbreak in the Pacific, and (2) the actions taken by the country in the Great Four Years. Although our country and people are not fighting on the battlefield, they are already in the war. The powder keg of the Pacific is now waiting for a spark, which will explode throughout a quarter of the eastern part of the earth. Our navy does not underestimate Japanese power. If there is an unfortunate disturbance in the Pacific, its scale will be by no means small. Our navy is fully prepared to cope with it.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd - The "Yomiuri Shimbun" published an editorial on its front page today stating that the United States believes that concentrating its navy in the Pacific is enough to restrain Japan. What it does not know is that 80 percent of the U.S. fleet is anchored in the Pacific, which is tantamount to "demobilization," and Germany can therefore seize a golden opportunity to carry out full-scale activities in the Atlantic. The naval reporter of the "Yomiuri Shimbun" believes that the U.S. Navy currently concentrated in the Pacific accounts for about 80 percent of its total strength, including seven or eight battleships, three aircraft carriers, about twelve heavy cruisers, more than fifty destroyers, more than thirty submarines, and many auxiliary ships. It is now believed that these ships are all on standby in Hawaii. In addition, there are two heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, several destroyers, and several submarines and auxiliary ships anchored in Manila. Only three battleships and other teams remain anchored in the western coastal base. The naval reporter commented on the Japanese-American negotiations and firmly believes that the United States wants to maintain peace in the Pacific until 1946, and until the completion of the two-ocean fleet, Britain and the United States are now intensifying the ABCD encirclement of Japan, while paying attention to the Soviet fleet in the Far East, hoping to pull it into the ABCD camp. The question at present is whether the Soviet Union, which has a neutrality agreement with Japan, will still be manipulated by Britain and the United States. The Soviet navy in the Far East is estimated to have more than 100 ships, including one cruiser, five destroyers, about sixty submarines, two submarine supply ships, gunboats, torpedo boats, mine-laying ships, and several special service ships. Britain and the United States are particularly concerned about Soviet submarines and aircraft. Observing the situation in the Pacific, it can be seen that Japan is now under severe threat from the ABCD encirclement. The United States is intensifying this encirclement in order to realize its sinister plan. However, Japan is now calmly observing the overall situation and has deep trust in the Empire's army and navy, especially because Prime Minister Tojo and Navy Minister Shimada have recently assured in parliament that the Japanese government's full preparations have been completed.</p>

<h3>All Sectors in Chongqing Hold Meeting to Welcome Mr. Tan Zan, Leader of Overseas Chinese in the United States; More Than 500 People Attend; Gu Zhenggang Presides; International Radio Broadcasts Meeting</h3>
<p>Chongqing - At 2:00 p.m. on the 2nd, the New Life Movement Service Center in Chongqing held a meeting to welcome Mr. Tan Zan, the leader of overseas Chinese in the United States. More than 500 representatives from various organizations attended. When Mr. Tan entered the meeting hall, the entire audience applauded warmly. The meeting was presided over by Gu Zhenggang, acting chairman of the National Comforting Association, who delivered a welcome speech, stating that Mr. Tan's behavior could be summarized by the four characters "Loyalty and Righteousness Worthy of Admiration." He has participated in the revolution since the Xingzhonghui and has remained loyal to the Party and the country for decades, always advancing with the times. He has also ruined his family several times for the revolution. His return to the country to attend the Political Participation Council after traveling thousands of miles is a manifestation of his loyalty to the Party and the country. Next, Mr. Tan reported on his impressions of returning to the country and the work of overseas Chinese in the United States to save the country. First, he said that he had two impressions of what he had seen and heard in Chongqing: (1) Witnessing the bombing of Chongqing increased his hatred and urged everyone to work together to complete the task of resistance and reconstruction in a short period of time. (2) Although the Japanese bombing was fierce, our compatriots remained calm as usual, without any fear, and became stronger as they were bombed, and various constructions were restored quickly. Our country is isolated and weak, and lacks armaments, but it has been able to fight Japan for more than four years, relying on four factors: (1) the supreme guiding principles left by the Founding Father, namely the Three Principles of the People; (2) the highly respected Chairman Lin and the wise leader Chairman Chiang Kai-shek presiding over the central government and leading the entire battle; (3) the bloody battles of the brave soldiers; (4) the arduous struggle of the people in the rear. Therefore, the more we fight, the stronger we become, and the path to victory is clear. Although overseas Chinese are far away from the motherland, they can all understand their responsibilities, contribute their strength, contribute their money, and contribute to the country. Since the beginning of the resistance and reconstruction, they have formed various national salvation groups, raised national salvation funds, and at the same time promoted resistance and reconstruction and carried out national diplomatic work in various places. At this point, Mr. Tan also recounted the organization of overseas Chinese national salvation groups in the Americas and the methods of raising national salvation funds. Fundraising must have a tight organization and a planned approach. Since the beginning of the resistance and reconstruction, overseas Chinese in the Americas have donated a total of 20 million U.S. dollars to save the country, which was greeted with warm applause from the audience. Finally, in an impassioned tone, he warned the audience that at this critical moment of life and death for the country and the nation, we can only unite sincerely and, under the leadership of the government and the leader, move forward with determination to sacrifice. The meeting did not end until after 4:00 p.m. The situation at today's meeting has been broadcast dynamically by China's International Broadcasting Station to all parts of the world so that overseas Chinese can also listen to the enthusiastic situation at the meeting.

<h3>Japanese Ship "Tatsuta Maru" Arrives in the United States to Evacuate Nationals; Japanese Nationals in the Philippines and Hong Kong Will Also Be Fully Evacuated</h3>

<p>Reuters, Mexico City, 3rd - According to the Japanese Minister to Mexico, he requested the Japanese government yesterday to order the Tatsuta Maru to stop at Manzanillo in order to carry Japanese nationals who fear that Mexico may follow the United States into war with Japan.

Only consulate personnel and a few people engaged in essential occupations will remain in Hong Kong. (United Press International Report on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong has abandoned its plan to evacuate residents who wish to leave Hong Kong by chartering a ship from Jardine Matheson, because residents are unwilling to leave Hong Kong voluntarily. Only a few of the Jardine Matheson employees followed the government's evacuation advice. Therefore, the company has abandoned its plan to send a ship exclusively for the evacuation of overseas Chinese. Anyone who wishes to leave Hong Kong should purchase ship seats as usual.

<h3>British Fleet Arrives in Singapore: Far Eastern Situation Completely Changed, Civil Governance Frontline Cooperation Intensifies Encirclement, Japan's Careless Advance Will Involve Danger</h3>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 3rd: Reuters correspondent reports that British Prime Minister Churchill, previously en route to the United States to hold the Atlantic Conference with President Roosevelt, aboard the British 35,000-ton new battleship "Prince of Wales," yesterday led several warships of the new British Eastern Fleet to arrive here. Instantly, cheers for the British fleet's arrival spread throughout Singapore like wildfire. Regular troops, volunteers, and civilians were overjoyed upon hearing the news. The organization and distribution of the entire Eastern Fleet naturally cannot be disclosed, but responsible parties here stated that the fleet is currently being established, consisting of several heavy warships and necessary auxiliary vessels. Several of these, including the flagship, have already arrived in Singapore, and other warships will arrive soon. The newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Fleet, Phillips, is currently using the "Prince of Wales" as his flagship. The arrival of this fleet not only indicates Britain's preparedness for war here but also demonstrates Britain's actual ability to prepare for war.</p>
<p>United Press, Singapore, 3rd: There were no extravagant or frenzied celebrations upon the British warships' arrival here, nor were there officials present to welcome them. These armored behemoths slowly sailed in, merely exchanging flag signals before mooring at the harbor as if they had always been berthed there.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 3rd: The Thai Consul-General here, when speaking with guests today about the British fleet's arrival in Singapore, stated that it serves as a serious warning to Japan and demonstrates Britain's attention to matters here. The Chinese Consul-General also called it a serious warning to Japan and a positive manifestation of ABCD powers' cooperation, citing Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's recent remarks urging the ABCD powers to take active measures.</p>
<p>Havas, New York, 3rd: "The New York World-Telegram" published an editorial today commenting on the British Far East Fleet's arrival in Singapore, stating that the old American strategy of retreating from the Philippines as the starting point of a Pacific war is now outdated. The arrival of the British fleet in Singapore has transformed the entire military strategic position and political situation in the Far East. Currently, the sea and air force strength of the ABCD group of countries in the Far East has greatly increased. If Japan intends to further implement aggression, it will be doomed. However, this matter requires the four countries to maintain unity to be effective; otherwise, the entire strength of the ABCD group of countries will disintegrate and will not be a threat to Japan. The lesson learned at the cost of immense suffering in Europe need not be re-enacted in the Far East.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 3rd: The general opinion of American newspapers is that although Japan is cautious due to the setbacks of the Axis powers, it will continue its aggression plans when the opportune moment arrives. The newspapers all praised the British fleet's arrival in Singapore as evidence of British-American cooperation in the Far East and a sign of the urgency of the situation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 3rd: Reuters correspondent reports that with the "Prince of Wales" battleship having arrived here, Japan will not be able to take any action in these waters, especially in the Gulf of Siam, without deploying its own warships. With the American heavy warships in Hawaii currently monitoring Japan's flank, Japan certainly dares not send its main fleet far from mainland Japan. A certain gentleman told the reporter, "This is the best excitement for those determined to defend Singapore. We all knew that without a fleet here, the battle would be very difficult, but we have never wavered in our determination and belief. Now that we have this necessary fleet, we are even more confident that we can handle everything."</p>
<h3>Mines Laid Off Singapore Island</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 12th: According to the Navy Department's announcement, the British Admiralty has issued a warning that mines have been laid in all the southeastern entrances to Singapore, and the mined area lies outside the south of Johor.</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies Fully Prepared to Accept Challenges at Any Time</p>
<p>Reuters, Batavia, 3rd: Although the situation in the Pacific is becoming increasingly tense, the public here shows no signs of panic, and life continues as usual. However, the train station is very busy in the early morning due to soldiers going to various outposts. Observers here, referring to the recently established emergency plans for the air force, said that a general mobilization of the air force could be completed in a matter of hours if necessary. The newspapers here have prominently published Lieutenant General Ando's statement that the Dutch East Indies would not withstand a single blow from Japan. Semi-officially, it is said that we currently have no time for useless debates, and Ando may later realize that his assessment of the Dutch East Indies was too low. Generally speaking, the newspapers here believe that Japan intends to delay matters, continuing the Washington talks while waging a war of nerves. Officials claim that no matter the circumstances, the Dutch East Indies will not change its determination and will continue to maintain its composure. One newspaper stated that Tokyo's grand plan will depend on the development of the Soviet and Libyan wars. Malaya is more directly threatened by Japan, so it is currently adopting more extensive plans. However, the general mobilization of the Dutch East Indies air force will also make the world aware that the Dutch East Indies is prepared to accept challenges at any time without hesitation. Another newspaper warned the public to be constantly prepared for enemy attacks, and stated that the plans adopted by the civil governance countries in the South Pacific are extremely effective, so the enemy cannot launch a surprise attack.</p>
<p>Reuters, Batavia, 3rd: Dr. Mok, the newly appointed Dutch Colonial Minister, originally planned to depart for London to take office today, but has temporarily postponed his departure due to the serious situation in the Pacific. Only the newly appointed Minister of Economic Affairs, Mr. Coston, is scheduled to go to London on Monday.</p>
<p>Reuters, Batavia, 3rd: It is reported that eighty Japanese residents, due to the tense situation, are eager to leave the Dutch East Indies. Unable to catch the regular passenger ship, they chartered six fishing boats, which set sail for Taiwan today to transfer to a regular passenger ship to return to Japan.</p>
<p>Complete Arrangements to Defend Australia and the Philippines</p>
<p>United Press, Canberra, 3rd: The Australian government yesterday continued to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation in the Pacific. Prime Minister Curtin is making various arrangements to maintain contact with the heads of various departments at any moment. The wartime cabinet is also scheduled to move to Melbourne on Thursday to work. Reliable sources say that there are currently no steps to cancel the Christmas holidays, but this will depend on developments abroad.</p>
<p>Reuters, Manila, 3rd: American sailors and officers who arrived here from Shanghai yesterday said that American sailors will remain in the Philippines. A Navy spokesman told people that the sailors have landed and are preparing everything. The total number of sailors remaining in the Philippines has not been announced.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 3rd: The House Islands Committee yesterday passed the Philippines' emergency economic bill.</p>
<h3>Gale-Force Winds and Flying Snow: Central Route Red Army's General Counteroffensive, Major Victory Again at the Frontline of Tula, Remnants of the Southern Route German Army Flee Westward in Disarray</h3>
<p>TASS, 3rd: A special correspondent for the "Izvestia" reports that on December 1st, true winter arrived. Snow fell at night, and the temperature dropped sharply in the morning, accompanied by a sudden gale and flying snow. Under these favorable conditions, the Red Army south of Moscow continued to advance on the enemy, who retreated in panic, attempting to desperately defend the highway south of K Town. Our army, under the cover of tanks, counterattacked and recaptured the village of Belyanovo. At night, the Germans counterattacked with tanks, but our army won another victory in response. In short, at various points in the southern Moscow area, the enemy was forced to retreat twenty to fifty kilometers from K Town, abandoning much military equipment along the way.</p>
<p>United Press, Kuibyshev, 3rd: The Soviet mechanized units' battles in the past two days have been one of the most powerful counteroffensives since the start of the war, repelling the German army that was fiercely attacking the Soviet capital from the south. The German army, attacked by fierce Soviet tanks, has been forced to retreat fifty kilometers in one place and twenty kilometers in another. A Soviet spokesman recently stated that the German army in these areas has completely collapsed. The Soviet army, launching a strong offensive from Moscow, has driven back the German army at point M. These German troops are now being gradually annihilated. Recent military news seems to indicate that the Red Army in this area has taken the Germans by surprise with lightning speed, as the Soviet army had secretly gathered a large number of ambushes in and around the Moscow area. After the Soviet army drove back the German army with infantry and tanks, it fiercely pursued the fleeing enemy. In this campaign, the Soviet army also captured the village of Balabanovo through a joint offensive of cavalry and tanks. According to military news arriving here today, when the Soviet army launched a fierce counteroffensive northwest of Tula, three more German divisions were defeated. The Soviet offensive in the area of Nara is still in progress.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 3rd: A special correspondent for "Pravda" reports that on December 1st, the enemy army on the central route was most active in Klin and Volokolamsk. The enemy attacked twice with three divisions, attempting to encircle our front line from the northeast and northwest, but was repelled. On December 2nd, the enemy attacked again, occupying a village at a heavy loss, but at night, our infantry, under the cover of British-made tanks, stormed into the village and re-evaluated it after street fighting. The enemy suffered 300 deaths, and 36 artillery positions and 40 military vehicles were destroyed by us. In the areas of Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets, there were only artillery battles and sentinel contact. In the area of Stalinogorsk, our army counterattacked and continued to pursue the enemy in victory. Our air force destroyed four German planes, fifty tanks, one hundred and fifteen military vehicles, and three anti-aircraft guns in one day, and annihilated a battalion of enemy infantry. In total, the enemy's attack on Moscow for the past fifteen days has not brought about any major changes. The enemy concentrated a large army in the areas of Klin and Volokolamsk, attempting to implement their pincer strategy and break into our positions. At some points, the enemy continued to advance, so the situation in this area remains the most serious.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 3rd: Official Soviet sources state that the Red Army on the Moscow front has dealt the German army an even heavier new blow. General Timoshenko's troops in the southern area are currently advancing west from Rostov and encircling the remnants of the German mechanized and infantry divisions retreating towards Mariupol. In many areas of the southern front, the Soviet army has taken the initiative.</p>
<p>TASS, Southern Front, 3rd: A "Pravda" military correspondent reports that our army is continuing to advance on the southern route, and the enemy is still retreating, abandoning countless war implements along the way. According to preliminary statistics, the German fascists suffered 21,000 deaths and injuries in the Battle of Rostov.</p>
<p>Northern Route German Army Switches from Offense to Defense, Suffers Heavy Losses in Five Days of Fighting</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 3rd: A special correspondent for "Izvestia" reports from Leningrad on the northern route that our army continues to clear out the enemy on the southern bank of the N River, recapturing many key points. Under the cover of tanks, our army began the battle for the T River crossing. Also, our artillery on the northern route has achieved great merit. In a short period, a certain artillery unit destroyed eighteen long-range cannons and annihilated four motorized detachments of the enemy.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 3rd: Soviet war news reports that several German divisions near Lake Ilmen in the northwestern area of the front line have been severely defeated and are now taking a defensive posture, digging trenches to defend. Over the past five days, Soviet troops in multiple areas of the northwestern front have broken through the enemy's vanguard line and attacked the enemy. Soviet troops defeated two battalions of the 96th Regiment of the 32nd German Infantry Division and annihilated two companies of infantry from the 1st German Assault Regiment. During the same period, Soviet troops northeast of Novgorod annihilated a battalion of enemy infantry and destroyed four enemy tanks. Elsewhere, Soviet troops also annihilated approximately 2,500 German officers and soldiers and destroyed 27 enemy artillery positions. The German offensive in all areas of the front line has been severely damaged and retreated.</p>
<p>British-Made Tanks Appear on the Battlefield, Charge and Conquer Everywhere</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 3rd: According to frontline reports, a large force of British tanks attacked German positions in the city of Volokolamsk yesterday. Although the German army fired countless direct-fire guns at the British tanks, and bullets rained down like hail, these British mechanized monsters remained unmoved and continued to advance straight to the center of the city. Soviet infantry also followed and advanced, and the German army was forced to withdraw from the city, abandoning a large amount of supplies. The military news also stated that the Soviet military believes this victory is very important, as it is reported that the German army has lost the huge amount of gasoline it had seized in the city in this battle. Before fleeing, the German army attempted to set fire to these gasoline stores, but the attempt failed. A Soviet military spokesman stated that after the British tanks entered the city, more than 300 remaining German soldiers who failed to escape were killed. The spokesman expressed deep satisfaction with the excellent quality of the British tanks.</p>
<p>German Army Destroys and Massacres Everywhere, Rostov Completely Changed</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 3rd: A "Pravda" report today detailed the situation in the Rostov area after the Soviet army drove out the German army. It is said that the entire area from Aksai to Rostov to Taganrog is like a large road, full of corpses. Soviet troops are now advancing steadily. Although Rostov was only under German control for a few days, it has been completely changed. Many houses have been reduced to ruins, and shops and residences have been looted. We cannot help but feel increasingly indignant as we walk along the deserted, glass-strewn streets. Two corpses hang in one house, each with a piece of paper attached to the chest that reads "This is how we Germans deal with guerrillas." There are dozens of corpses inside No. 53 Angel Street, because a German officer in this area was killed by an unknown person, and the German army then shot Professor Rozhdasvensky's family to show revenge. The German army attempted to rule Rostov with blood, but the city will never yield, but will repay blood debts with blood. The corpses of German officers and soldiers killed at night were thrown into the frozen Don River. Several women also strangled three drunken German soldiers. The residents of Rostov have no fear in their hearts, only resentment. On the morning after the recapture of Rostov, they began to work separately. Railway workers repaired bridges on the Don River, women rushed to the bakery, workers were busy repairing streetcar lines, and soldiers were urgently building new power lines. White-gloved civilian groups are now seen at intersections again. The city of Rostov has now returned to normal life, and is carrying out the work of cleaning up the devastation, restoring factory water and electricity supply, and facilitating transportation.</p>
<h3>Britain Issues Final Warning to Finland, Declaration of War Seems Inevitable</h3>
<p>United Press, Stockholm, 3rd: News obtained from Helsinki yesterday indicates that Britain has issued a final warning to Finland regarding Finland's continued participation in the war against the Soviet Union, and that this warning will expire on Friday.</p>
<p>TASS, London, 3rd: A diplomatic observer for "The Times" reports that according to reports from Helsinki and Washington, Britain is on the eve of declaring war on Finland. On November 29, the Finnish Prime Minister convened a cabinet meeting and announced that Britain has decided to declare war on Finland. Since Finland cannot stop invading the Soviet Union, the British government has no choice but to declare a state of war with Finland, Hungary, and Romania.</p>
<h3>Franco-German Cooperation Accelerates Negotiations</h3>
<p>United Press, Vichy, 3rd: The French and German governments today studied detailed reports of the meeting between Pétain and Göring. At the same time, French political commentators here said that this meeting is as important as the meeting between Pétain and Hitler in Montoire last year, because this meeting is to enlighten the future of Franco-German cooperation. Authoritative sources claim that the meeting between German Ambassador Abetz and French Ambassador Brinon in Paris today is also an indication that France and Germany are accelerating negotiations.</p>
<h3>Japan's Central Cooperative Council Scheduled to Meet, Tojo Will Explain Policies</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd: According to Japanese sources, the Central Cooperative Committee of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association is scheduled to hold its second meeting in Tokyo on December 8, lasting five days. At that time, Prime Minister Tojo, Foreign Minister Togo, Minister of Finance Kaya, and other cabinet members will all attend to explain the government's policies for dealing with the tense international situation. The meeting will consider the following major national issues: (1) Improving public morale, (2) Stabilizing the national mobilization program, (3) Establishing a cooperative political system, (4) Consolidating the nation's vitality, (5) Stabilizing wartime food supply, (6) Utilizing Japan's economic strength.</p>
<h3>Japan's Economy on the Brink of Collapse, Inevitable Defeat if it Participates in the War</h3>
<p>United Press, New York, 3rd: "The Wall Street Journal" published an analysis yesterday on the front page, concluding that "Economically, Japan is living on borrowed time." The report stated, "There is a country in the world today that is standing on the edge of war, and the outcome of the war, 99 percent certain, is enough to make its empire collapse. That country is Japan." The article pointed out that 80 percent of Japan's raw materials are supplied by Britain, the United States, and the Dutch East Indies.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>British Fleet Sails to the Far East</h3>
<p>Last month, the United States passed an amendment to the Neutrality Act on the 13th, which is a major event in recent international affairs. The spirit of the Neutrality Act had long been dead in name only, but it always stood in the way, preventing the United States from taking a further step to share the sacred task of anti-aggression with the Allied democratic countries. The passage of the bill, on the negative side, broke through the previous American fear of being affected by the war, and on the positive side, American merchant ships carrying war materials gained the freedom to enter and exit the war zone and could directly resist the Axis powers with arms. More importantly, the United States will share part of the responsibility for the Atlantic convoy mission, reducing the burden on the British fleet, thus making it possible for the British fleet to transfer part of its forces from the Atlantic to reinforce the Mediterranean and the Far East. Therefore, at the same time that the United States amended the Neutrality Act, British Prime Minister Churchill expressed that Britain would greatly enhance its naval strength in the Far East. It is generally speculated that the British fleet, including powerful warships, is expected to appear in the Pacific and Indian Oceans soon. Sure enough, less than two weeks later, just as the situation in the Far East reached its final juncture, the British Far East Fleet, with the new 35,000-ton battleship Prince of Wales as its flagship, had arrived in the Far East the day before yesterday to reinforce the fortress of Singapore.</p>
<p>The current Pacific problem is being negotiated solely by the United States and Japan, with Britain standing in a position of advancing and retreating with the United States. However, looking at the recent movements of the British side, it is clear that they are more active and eager than Washington. For example, the US authorities have not yet revealed how to deal with a possible war in the Far East, while Churchill has clearly declared that Britain will declare war on the US within an hour. The US is only engaged in passive preparations for evacuating expatriates and troops, while Britain's territories in the Far East, from Burma to the Malay Peninsula to Australia, have entered a wartime state. This is naturally because British territory bears the brunt, and if war unfortunately breaks out, it will inevitably erupt first between Britain and Japan. Moreover, for strategic reasons, at least in the initial stages of the war, Britain will bear a greater responsibility. Now, the main force of the US Pacific Fleet is far away in Pearl Harbor, 3,000 nautical miles away. There is no naval base that can be used between there and the west coast of the Pacific. In the one or two weeks before the US fleet can come to help, the defense of the western Pacific cannot but rely solely on the British maritime power. Therefore, at this moment, it is natural for the British to send a powerful fleet into the solid and perfect fortress of Singapore, which only lacks warships.</p>
<p>No matter how deliberately the Japanese side expresses its contempt, the strength of the ABCD line, without exaggeration, is at least powerful and invincible in the Far East. On land, China alone is enough to form a balance with Japan. In the air, the sum of the British and American Far East air forces has proved to exceed Japan in both quality and quantity. At sea, comparing only the United States and Japan, the ratio of their existing total strength is said by the Japanese themselves to be 100 to 81 (?). Although the United States cannot but take into account the security of the Atlantic, it always maintains the superiority of the Pacific Fleet over the entire Japanese fleet. Therefore, in terms of actual strength, Japan has absolutely no chance to be侥幸, but in terms of geographical factors, it has a slight innate advantage. This is undoubtedly the most noteworthy issue for the future Far East War, which will be dominated by a naval decisive battle. Although the US Pacific Fleet has enormous strength and the endurance to facilitate long-range operations, the current focus of the crisis is in the South China Sea and near the Indochina Peninsula. The main force of the US fleet, thousands of miles away, is obviously beyond reach. Even if it rushes to help, it must make foolproof strategic plans in order to avoid repeating the mistakes of the Russian Baltic Fleet in the Battle of Tsushima in the Russo-Japanese War. However, if the ABCD line can put up a strong resistance in the Malay Peninsula, Burma, the Dutch East Indies, etc., and if there is a strong navy in the South China Sea that can respond to changes, then the situation of the war will be completely different. At that time, the Japanese army will encounter strong resistance in the above-mentioned areas, and under the opportunity for the US fleet to open westward, Japan will be in an awkward situation of being attacked from both sides. Recently, Britain's active reinforcement of various places in Southeast Asia is indeed a wise precaution, and the large-scale eastward movement of a strong fleet to strengthen the maritime strength of the democratic front in the South Pacific is enough to change the situation of offense and defense in the Far East.</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales and the George V are the latest type of battleships in the UK. They participated in the battle against the German battleship Bismarck in the Strait of Denmark this summer. Now they have come to Singapore to reinforce the defense, which shows the importance the British authorities attach to the crisis in the Far East. Compared with the Japanese latest battleships Nagato and Mutsu, the British ships are far superior in terms of tonnage, speed, armor, and defense. However, they are equipped with only ten 14-inch guns, unlike the Japanese ships, which are equipped with eight 16-inch guns. However, according to experts, the penetration and superiority of this type of 14-inch gun is no less than that of ships equipped with eight or nine 16-inch guns. However, Japan has been secretly building ships for many years, and it is said that its latest type of main battle ships, Nisshin and Takamatsu, have been launched, but their performance is still unknown. Moreover, Japan has been short of materials and steel for many years, and its shipbuilding program cannot compete with any of the UK and the US. It is still unknown how many ships, besides the Prince of Wales, have come at the same time. According to naval practice, each heavy battleship must be assisted by several cruisers and destroyers. Even if the main force of the British fleet in this eastward movement is only this one ship, there must be several auxiliary ships coming together to form a strong combat unit. The remnants of the German and Italian navies are now insignificant, and the Atlantic convoy only requires destroyers and light cruisers, and the United States is sharing the burden. If the situation in the Far East changes, it is believed that the UK will be able to send more naval main forces eastward to reinforce the defense.</p>
<p>Although the US-Japan negotiations are in a dangerous situation, they are not completely hopeless. If the Japanese side is not prepared to take excessive risks, it should understand the warning significance of the British side's contingency preparations and quickly make plans to rein in at the edge of the cliff. For the sake of preparedness, the US fleet in Pearl Harbor should also take parallel measures with the UK. Then, no matter what the future situation is, the democratic front has a solid and indestructible favorable position in the West Pacific strategically, and it is also more conducive to promoting the awakening of the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Libyan Front: British and German Forces in Mixed Battle; British Corridor Southeast of Tobruk Breached</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 3rd - According to a recent public statement, enemy forces east of Tobruk in North Africa have made contact with enemy forces six miles north of El Gazala. Responsible officials here explain that the British corridor outside Tobruk has been temporarily breached. It is estimated that British forces are now fighting to restore this corridor. Contact between Tobruk and British ground forces may have been temporarily cut off again, but not as completely as before, as the situation southeast of Tobruk is constantly changing. The main force of the attacking enemy seems to be the 15th Panzer Division, which launched an attack from the southwest. Those who have joined forces with them may be the remnants of the German 21st Division. The battle is continuing, and the situation is chaotic. The German forces now appear to be able to attempt to break through and escape to the west.</p>
<p>Many Axis Supply Ships Sunk</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 3rd</p>
<p>Enemy ships transporting military supplies across the central Mediterranean to support enemy forces in Libya were intercepted by allied ships and suffered heavy losses. Yesterday morning, British ships intercepted the Italian supply ship "Adriana" (2,76 tons), which was loaded with ammunition and vehicles, and sank it with gunfire. Some of the enemy crew were rescued. Subsequently, British ships intercepted the enemy oil tanker "Mantovani" (6,500 tons) and the escorting enemy destroyer "Mostai" (1,628 tons). The enemy ship was hit and exploded, and the "Mantovani", carrying approximately 10,000 tons of gasoline, was also hit and sunk. The British ships suffered no damage, and the crew suffered no casualties.</p>
<p>Italian Forces in Gondar Have Completely Surrendered</p>
<p>Reuters, Nairobi, 3rd - According to a report published here yesterday, enemy troops stationed around Gondar in East Africa have now completely surrendered. It is reported that approximately 11,500 Italian soldiers and 11,000 native soldiers were captured in Gondar. British casualties were light. The evacuation of prisoners began on November 30 and is still ongoing. Italian General Nasam and several other senior officers were among the first to be evacuated. The exact number of captured artillery, ammunition, transport, and military supplies is not yet known, but it is known to be very large, including 50 cannons. The enemy troops stationed around the area have now completely surrendered, and Gondar has adopted a new British military administrative system.</p>
<h3>HMAS Sydney: Glorious Achievements; Australians Proud</h3>
<p>Reuters, Sydney, 3rd - Apart from the Australian destroyer "Waterhen," which was sunk in the Mediterranean in early July this year, the loss of the cruiser "Sydney" is the first major loss in Australian naval warfare in two years. The "Sydney" achieved remarkable military exploits in the Mediterranean and continued the glorious history of the previous "Sydney," which sank the famous German ship "Emden" in 1914. The public is saddened by the unfortunate news of the ship's loss. Yesterday, they gathered at the Cathedral here to hold a solemn memorial service. Newspapers here said that the ship could no longer fight, but its spirit remained, and it was as glorious as the ships "Cossack" and "Ajax." The Australian government gazette also said that the loss of the ship was indeed regrettable, but the ship maintained the glory of the Australian Navy and completed brilliant combat achievements, which the Australian people should be proud of.</p>
<p>Reuters, Melbourne, 3rd - Survivors of the German raider "Kormoran," which was sunk by the lost Australian cruiser "Sydney," have arrived at a port in western Australia in two boats. It is claimed that the "Kormoran" engaged in battle with the "Sydney" on November 19, and the first shell hit the bridge. Although the "Sydney" was sinking, it continued to fire, causing the German ship to be hit and catch fire. A total of 286 crew members of the "Kormoran" were rescued, about ten of whom were injured by shrapnel.</p>
<h3>Britain Gathers Manpower to Cope with Crisis; Prime Minister Proposes in Parliament to Recruit Women for Military Service</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 3rd - British Prime Minister Churchill said last night in the House of Commons that when proposing to recruit women and gather manpower to seek the highest national effort, invasions and air raids would often come until the end of the war. Invasions may never materialize, but we must have well-trained mobile troops constantly in preparation to prevent them from happening. As for the danger of air raids, Hitler will at any time acknowledge his defeat by the Soviet army and try to vent his anger on us. We should deal with it with a larger army and various new types of equipment. The government will ask Parliament to grant it the power to recruit unmarried women between the ages of 20 and 30, approximately 1,620,000 people, into military service, and the age for men to begin military service will also be reduced to 18, so that 70,000 more people can be obtained in 1942. All men and women between the ages of 16 and 18 will be registered and join the National Volunteer Organization. Women between the ages of 20 and 30 can choose one of two jobs: either in the civil defense auxiliary team or in industries that need mobile workers.</p>
<h3>Revolutionary Plot Uncovered in Italy; Sixty People Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>International News Service, Rome, 3rd - A major plot to assassinate Mussolini and overthrow the fascist government was discovered in Trieste today. Sixty people have been sentenced to death. It is understood that this plot is not only limited to assassinating the Italian Prime Minister and overthrowing the Italian government, but also aims to sabotage Italian wartime industries and transportation. It is reported that these sixty defendants "are all members of the People's Freedom Party and the Communist Party," and it is also said that they are related to the three recent major explosions in ammunition factories. It is said that 127 people were killed and more than 1,000 injured in the three explosions. The Stefani News Agency declared that this large-scale conspiracy originally intended to encourage a national revolution and to separate the two countries of Italy and Germany. The German side claimed that the conspiracy originated twenty years ago, but the conspirators' first activity, an attempt to assassinate Mussolini, was only before the Third War. The scope of their activities was to blow up ammunition factories and railways. Only eleven of the ringleaders of the conspirators have been arrested so far. The Italian government will not announce the names of those who have been arrested and those who are still being pursued.</p>
<h3>British Troops Land in Equatorial Africa</h3>
<p>United Press, Rome, 3rd - "Messaggero" today carried a Vichy message stating that the place where British troops landed on the coast of Equatorial Africa is within striking distance of French colonies. Rear Admiral Platon is currently inspecting the area to reorganize French local defenses.</p>
<h3>Vichy Government Speaks for Japan</h3>
<p>Havas, Vichy, 3rd - Regarding US President Roosevelt's statement that the number of Japanese troops in Vietnam has exceeded the number stipulated in the Franco-Japanese agreement, well-informed sources here recently commented that the number of Japanese troops in Vietnam has not exceeded the scope of the agreement. The French government has always insisted on this.</p>
<h3>War in Europe: Germany Two Years After the War</h3>
<p>Just as it was difficult to resolve, the mother came and stopped them, telling one child to turn the bicycle upright and let his sister sit on it. That girl, however, said, "Don't move. Leave it like this. Now it's my turn to be a pilot."</p>
<p>In German parks, a small number of benches are placed in the worst corners of the scenery, marked with the words "For Jews Only," and they are often very crowded. The people sitting there try to squeeze together as much as possible to make room for more people. Their faces are all dull and expressionless. At that time, an order was just issued that if a bombed family needed housing, or a married party soldier could not find a suitable apartment, the Jews should immediately give up their apartment. The Jews who were ordered to move out knew that they had to leave all the furniture for the new owners to use.</p>
<p>When the weather is warm, there is more fresh food in the open-air vegetable markets. On the vegetable stalls under the dilapidated tents, lettuce and radishes are displayed until 11:30 in the afternoon before they are closed. Except for poultry, fruits, and a few vegetables, the food allowed on the ration cards can usually be purchased. However, a small number of seasonal summer items can only be purchased by housewives who have a special relationship with the store. These items, such as seagull eggs, fresh asparagus, spinach, and potatoes, are sold under the counter. News about the famine in Belgium, the high prices and lack of supplies in France, the war-torn capital of Yugoslavia, transportation difficulties, food shortages for residents, and the fact that famous hotels in Athens only have one or two dishes per meal at exorbitant prices has been leaked to Germany. Therefore, when the weekly meat ration for each person in Germany was reduced from 500 grams to 400 grams from June 2, it did not cause any dissatisfaction among the people. They mostly know that what they are eating this summer is already much better than what people in other parts of Europe are eating.</p>
<p>Some girls wear short socks, and some even go barefoot. The snow-white legs of the young women have all been tanned black. The fashionable women in Berlin wear new-style coats, beautiful hats, and neat gloves, but from the knees down they are completely naked. There are also those who use eyebrow pencils to draw a fake seam on the back of their calves to pretend to be wearing long stockings. They can say like the poet, "Hard work, happy holidays." But he did not mention where he had seen happy holidays in Germany.</p>
<p>Although there is much deep dissatisfaction within Germany, the forces are divided and weak and cannot unite for effective resistance. Catholics hate communists, Prussian imperialists support the Hohenzollern royal family, and Bavarian monarchists support the Wittelsbach royal family. These two factions are also incompatible with radicals and democrats. Democrats also believe that their future is hopeless.</p>
<p>Although Germans want peace, they want a peace that can be won now, not a defeated peace. They still remember how the peace after the last European war taught them a lesson, and they know that the situation after this defeat will be even worse than before. They know that, apart from the British peace terms, the people of all the defeated countries on the European continent are waiting for revenge.</p>
<p>The first hope of most Germans is that Germany will not be defeated, and overthrowing the current regime is secondary. If Germans think further, they will inevitably ask, "What will we replace the current government with? If we win under the current government, we cannot overthrow it. If we overthrow the current government, we cannot win."</p>
<p>Germans like to think on the more optimistic side. But what about the situation in the war against Russia? Will the United States declare war on Germany? When can we get peace? Will we be defeated? Don't think about these things at all. Just work, wait in line, sleep, and live on.</p>
<p>What made the Germans first feel the reality of the war was probably the war against Russia. Germany's previous victories were all overwhelming and involved little bloodshed. When the German army attacked Crete, I happened to be in a village, and news came that two local teenagers had been killed in action. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>All British Merchant Ships in Coastal Ports Suspend Navigation; Receive Emergency Orders to Evacuate; Ships in North China Sail Directly to Hong Kong; Evacuation Ship Anhui Sailed from Shanghai Yesterday with More Than 400 Women and Children</h3>
<p>The situation in the Far East has not eased in recent days. British and American evacuations are busy. British and American ships sailing to the Far East have now all suspended navigation. British and American expatriates in the occupied areas are now being evacuated one after another. The Taikoo Company's Anhui was designated by the British Embassy as a special ship for evacuation. Yesterday afternoon at about 1:00 p.m., it sailed from the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession, carrying more than 400 British expatriate women and children southward. Among them, there were about 50 Indian expatriates who were evacuated from the occupied areas of the Yangtze River and North China. In addition, 70 British expatriates were evacuated from Tianjin and arrived in Shanghai on the 1st of this month. They transferred to the Anhui and left Shanghai. Most of them went to Hong Kong to transfer to ships to Australia, and some of them took the original ship to Calcutta, India. There was also a small number of British expatriates who were enlisting for military service in Singapore. According to some of the evacuated British expatriate women and children, they will soon be able to return to Shanghai. Another part said that they would go to Australia to live permanently and would not return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>British Ships in Shanghai Have Been Requisitioned</p>
<p>There are still 8,000 British and Indian expatriates in this city. If necessary in the future, how these expatriates will be evacuated is now being planned. The British expatriates carried by the Anhui were the second evacuation since the Sino-Japanese War four years ago. Recently, British ships in Shanghai have been requisitioned. The Taikoo Company's Anhui, Nanning, and Beihai left Shanghai yesterday. The Beihai arrived in port at about 3:00 p.m. the day before yesterday (2nd). It was originally scheduled to carry cargo south to Hong Kong, Singapore, and then to Yangon this Sunday. It received an emergency order the night before last to completely unload the cargo before 2:00 p.m. yesterday, and then at 3:00 p.m., it set sail with more than a dozen British employees of the Taikoo Company.</p>
<p>Three Ships Turned Back Temporarily</p>
<p>It is reported that the Taikoo Company's Guizhou and Guiyang, and the Jardine Matheson's Fu Sheng arrived at the Wusongkou yesterday morning. Because they received a telegram ordering them to return to Hong Kong, the three ships anchored outside the port and did not enter the Songkou. After the Nanning, Anhui, and Beihai left port, the six ships will sail to Hong Kong together. The Taikoo Company's Ganzhou and New Beijing in North China will also not come to Shanghai. The Ganzhou sailed directly from Qingdao to Hong Kong the day before yesterday (2nd), and the New Beijing also sailed directly from Yantai to Hong Kong the day before yesterday. The Jardine Matheson's Risheng, which left Shanghai for Tianjin the day before yesterday, may also have difficulty reaching its destination, or it may sail south halfway.</p>
<p>Three Small Ships Moved to Puxi</p>
<p>The Taikoo Company also has three shallow-water ships, the Suiding, Jintang, and Wantong, which operate on the Sichuan River, and about 20 iron cargo barges, all of which are berthed at the Yangjiadu Wharf in Pudong. The three shallow-water ships were suddenly towed to the company's wharf in the French Concession by small ships yesterday afternoon. The Wantong stopped at Pier No. 2, and the Suiding and Jintang were docked together at Pier No. 1. It is said that after being repaired urgently, they will also leave Shanghai for Singapore immediately. The iron cargo barges are still berthed in Pudong and will have to be towed to the Puxi Wharf when necessary. As of now, British and American ships along the Chinese coast have completely evacuated and sailed to Hong Kong or Singapore.</p>
<p>Japanese Ships Have Also Been Requisitioned for Military Use</p>
<p>The Japanese merchant ships, except for the Shanghai Maru and Nagasaki Maru, which operate on the Sino-Japanese liaison route, are all being requisitioned for military use. Only French ships are maintaining the Nanyang route. The French Company's Kai Ting sailed from Shanghai to Haiphong yesterday morning. The post ship General Joffre is scheduled to depart at 8:00 a.m. today, returning to Saigon via Little Luzon. There are more than 100 passengers, including about 30 American bridges, who are wealthy merchants in this city. They will take the post ship to Little Luzon and transfer to ships to return to the United States. After General Joffre leaves Shanghai this morning, there is still the D'Artagnan post ship remaining in Shanghai, which will return to Saigon and Little Luzon next Wednesday (10th). According to the French Company yesterday, it has received secret orders that ship schedules will also be kept secret in the future. According to authoritative sources in the shipping industry, although the current situation is serious, British and American merchant ships have completely left Shanghai and will no longer sail here, but if the situation improves, they can resume navigation at any time.</p>
<h3>Flour Stored in This City is Not Allowed to Be Moved or Exported; Purchase of Stored Flour is Being Studied for Pricing; Unregistered Stored Flour is Equivalent to Being "Frozen"</h3>
<p>According to the Information Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Bureau held a special meeting at 3:30 p.m. yesterday (3rd), and it was resolved that any attempt to move flour for export would be prohibited. At the same time, the Bureau is preparing to purchase flour intended for export. This measure is necessary in order to maintain reserves to meet the needs of this port and is waiting for the foreign flour that has already been ordered to be shipped to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Registration</p>
<p>The registration of stored flour organized by the Bureau has just been completed. Although the amount of stored flour registered is much larger than estimated, in view of transportation difficulties and the uncertain situation in the Pacific, the Bureau believes that it is unwise to allow flour to be exported, resulting in a reduction in reserves.</p>
<p>Purchase</p>
<p>Regarding the Bureau's purchase of stored flour, the Price Control Committee will study it in order to determine a price that can give importers a reasonable and fair profit. The Bureau reports that there is currently a large amount of stored flour that has not been registered with the Bureau in accordance with regulations. If the Bureau decides to purchase stored flour, it will not give the same profit to unregistered flour. Those who have not yet registered with the Bureau should do so as soon as possible for their own and the public's benefit. Do not wait and see. Currently unregistered stored flour is equivalent to being "frozen," because the Bureau does not intend to issue transportation permits.</p>
<h3>A Batch of Bureau Rice Released from Warehouses - Sold Yesterday - Another 27,000 Bags Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Rice Dealers Association, again dispatched representatives the day before yesterday to obtain 294 permits for transporting rice from the Rice Management Committee. Dealers with card numbers 91 to 294 were authorized to pay and pick up goods yesterday, resuming the sale of foreign rice in stores. Starting today, the registration for the sale of foreign rice stored in warehouses will continue, limited to rice dealers lacking rice within the International Settlement. Furthermore, the Panama merchant ship "Mariposa," arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday morning. The ship carries 27,000 bags of rice purchased by the Public Works Department, all of which will be unloaded in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Three Major Fire Cases - Strict Investigation and Handling</h3>
<p>The defendant, Bao Gongxiang (transliteration), is the manager of the Fagud (transliteration) Transportation Company at 423 Sichuan Road. The company's warehouse suddenly caught fire on the afternoon of October 28, resulting in significant losses and the death of a Chinese firefighter in the Public Concession. It is now known that the case will be retried in the Special First Court the day after tomorrow. Furthermore, the goods stored in the warehouse are estimated to be worth approximately 4.5 million yuan, with losses exceeding 2.65 million yuan, not including the burned buildings. Last Saturday afternoon, a fire broke out at No. 646 Jing'an Temple Road due to the storage of flammable liquids, resulting in four deaths and seven injuries. The culprit is being searched for by the police. It is understood that storing flammable materials is illegal, and the culprit's escape from justice is even more despicable. Regarding the fire on Zhu Bao San Road, the responsible authorities stated that an investigation is underway, and the losses are still difficult to estimate.</p>
<h3>Drills on Various Islands in Manila - Coastal Artillery Firing - Designated Dangerous Areas - Shanghai Customs Has Received Notification</h3>
<p>According to a notice from the Philippine U.S. Naval Authorities to the Jianghai Customs, submarine and mine drills will continue to be conducted in Manila Harbor and on islands with fortifications throughout December. From December 1st to the 23rd, excluding Sundays, coastal artillery, anti-aircraft artillery, and machine gun firing drills will be conducted on the islands daily. The area within 15 kilometers of the islands' coasts is designated as a dangerous zone. All ships entering and exiting must strictly adhere to navigation rules. After receiving the report, the customs office has posted notices strictly instructing all vessels to pay attention.</p>
<h3>German Diplomatic Personnel - Will Come to Shanghai from Tianjin</h3>
<p>It is recently learned that Weitmann (former German Consul-General in San Francisco), who arrived in Dagu a few days ago to take office as the German Consul-General there, is expected to come to Shanghai this week. Weitmann was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday morning, but the German Embassy in Shanghai has now received a message that his arrival will be slightly delayed. Accompanying Weitmann is Winterler, a former key German diplomatic official stationed in South America.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department Announces - Third Batch of Price-Controlled Goods - Mainly Canned Food, Totaling Over a Hundred Items</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department has announced the third price control list, which includes over one hundred items subject to price controls, mainly canned food. The aforementioned price control list will take effect from the 4th of this month. All retail stores must sell according to the price limits and must not exceed them, and should also try their best to limit sales to meet customers' immediate needs. Subsequent price control lists will be announced in succession as soon as they are obtained. This price limit has been fully agreed upon by the French Concession authorities and will also be implemented in the French Concession at the same time. Those concerned can obtain the aforementioned price control list from the relevant police stations. It is noted that the price controls still do not include daily necessities generally used by Chinese people.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Discusses Patrol Lines in Police District E with Japanese Side - Police Officers Only Patrol Roads Outside the Boundary - But the Police Department's Authority is Defined</h3>
<p>Representatives from the Public Works Department and the Police Department and the Japanese authorities have begun discussions to formulate the final detailed measures for the establishment of "Police District E", which is expected to be completed soon. The Public Works Department and the Japanese side have long agreed on the basic points for establishing this new police district.</p>
<p>Establish a Separate Police Force Managed by the Japanese</p>
<p>The establishment of Police District "E" involves the establishment of a separate police force managed by the Japanese, covering the area north of the Suzhou Creek. The Public Works Department has announced that it will send 300 additional police officers to serve north of the Suzhou Creek. According to disclosures from key police officials, this batch of police officers will be dispatched when Police District "E" is established. According to the plan for setting up Police District "E," it was first proposed two years ago when Fackling was the Chairman of the Public Works Department. The final discussion on setting up this new police district only began when the Japanese Bo Masaru was recently appointed as the Special Deputy Commissioner of the Police Department.</p>
<p>Divide Authority with Reference to Maps</p>
<p>The spokesman of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai stated when he hosted a press conference in April last year that the police officers in District "E" would only patrol the roads outside the boundary: North Sichuan Road, Dixiwei Road, Jiangwan Road, and Scott Road. The Police Department will have jurisdiction, but the Police Department's authority will not extend to the area between North Sichuan Road and Dixiwei Road. The small hill between Oujia Road and Dixiwei Road is also not under the Police Department's jurisdiction. These boundaries were agreed upon after careful study of maps mutually agreed upon by the Public Works Department and the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>No Storing of Goods Allowed in Residences</h3>
<p>The Fire Department of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession and the Fire Brigade of the French Concession Authority, considering that fires have been constantly occurring in the concessions recently, with the causes of the fires mostly due to residents storing flammable materials, coupled with the dry weather, making it difficult to extinguish fires once they occur, endangering the lives and property of citizens and affecting the order and tranquility, have decided to take investigation and supervision measures to eliminate the occurrence of unexpected incidents. Residences are not allowed in places where goods are stored and windows are inconvenient, and large quantities of goods are not allowed to be stored in residences. Flammable materials must absolutely not be stored. Violators will be punished according to violation regulations. Furthermore, car garages along the road are not allowed to be converted into bedrooms in order to maintain public order and tranquility. At the same time, the police authorities are requested to assist in handling the matter.</p>
<h3>The Entire Fourth Regiment of the U.S. Military is Stationed on the Philippine Islands</h3>
<p>After the 4th Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai left Shanghai in batches on the 27th and 28th of last month on the President Madison and President Harrison of the American President Lines, it was reported yesterday that the first batch of 350 men of the Second Battalion, led by Curtis, had safely arrived in Manila on the 1st. The second batch of 400 men of the First Battalion, led by Colonel Howard, also arrived in the Philippines the next day. The U.S. troops withdrawn from Shanghai have been ordered to be temporarily stationed on the Philippine Islands to strengthen the defense of the area. They are currently being received by the local government and are surveying barracks.</p>
<h3>U.S. Ship Captain Smith Visited Japanese Authorities Yesterday</h3>
<p>Captain Smith, the captain of the U.S. Yangtze River Fleet's gunboat Wake, visited the Japanese military and political authorities in Shanghai yesterday morning and boarded the Izumo flagship to pay a formal visit to the Japanese naval commander.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cavalry Artillery Arrives in Shanghai Every Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday, from 12:15 PM to 1:30 PM, the North Railway Station was once again under martial law. It is said that Chinese and Japanese police officers from the concession went to the North Station for inquiries and negotiations. In recent days, large numbers of Japanese soldiers have been transported from the interior to Shanghai by the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railway trains. There are about 30 to 40 cars every day, most of them cavalry and artillery, carrying horses and small steel cannons, machine guns, anti-aircraft guns, and gun carriages, etc., heading to Wusong.</p>
<h3>Reduction of Japanese Guard Posts in Zhabei</h3>
<p>Japanese guard posts with two to four soldiers, which were previously stationed at the intersection of Zhongshan Road and Jiaotong Road, Liuying River, Liuying Bridge, Jiyang Bridge, Qiujiang Road, Gonghexin Road, Xinmin Road, and Wuzhen Road in Zhabei, have recently been removed. Other places such as Xin Zha Bridge and the intersection of Baoshan Road, Bazilu Fusheng Road, Haining Road North Jiangxi Road, Baoshan Road Qiujiang Road intersection, and the south bank of Xinmin Road Zaoqiao are still guarded by soldiers as before.</p>
<h3>Change in Price-Controlled Goods</h3>
<p>The price limits for the following items have been changed: (1) Sunlight Soap (Large) 1.50 yuan for two bars, (Small) 1 yuan, White Honey Soap (Large) 1.20 yuan, (Small) 90 cents, Lux Soap 1.10 yuan per bar.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Concert</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department Orchestra is scheduled to hold the ninth weekly symphony concert of the season at the Lyceum Theatre at 5:15 PM this Sunday afternoon. Three programs have been arranged, with seat prices of 6 yuan, 5 yuan, 3 yuan, and 2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Lifting the Ban on Local Tobacco Leaves and Tobacco Shreds</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's office in Hong Kong recently received an order from the Ministry of Economic Affairs stating, "After reviewing, the local tobacco leaves and tobacco shreds of various provinces, which were previously designated by the Ministry as prohibited items for transportation, are now declassified, and merchants are allowed to transport and sell them freely." After receiving the order, the Chamber of Commerce has instructed the relevant trade associations to comply.</p>
<h3>Post Office Notice for Unclaimed Items</h3>
<p>Post office news: When the public goes to various branches to buy stamps or mail items, they often forget items on the post office counters. If these items do not fall into the hands of outsiders, the post office will keep them. Within three months, they can be reclaimed at the original branch. Recently, the Fujian Road Branch announced a batch of items left at the branch, including a contract, a fan, and a can of copper polishing oil (all left on the counter), a cloth cheongsam (on the counter), a cloth long gown (outside the counter), and a handkerchief (on the counter).</p>
<h3>Brief Report on the Bible Society's Movement Week</h3>
<p>The China Bible Society at 58 Hong Kong Road traditionally designates a Bible Worship Period every December, which is indispensable in today's chaotic times. In addition to sending letters, for the purpose of expanding publicity, the Bible Movement Week will be held from December 4th to 10th at the Gospel Radio Station at 128 Museum Road, with prominent figures from various churches in the city invited to give broadcasts, with Chinese and English groups every night. Chinese from 6:45 PM to 7:15 PM, English from 8:40 PM to 9:00 PM. At the same time, there will be a Bible exhibition at the Moore Memorial Church at 316 Yu Qiaqing Road in the city, displaying Chinese and English Bibles, on December 6th, 7th, and 8th.</p>

<h3>Future Gasoline Supply - Depends on the Situation - If Shipping Remains Smooth, No Further Reductions May Be Necessary</h3>
<p>Personnel from Shanghai's three major gasoline companies have recently appealed to the public to use gasoline more sparingly to help the city through the current "temporary gasoline shortage." It is said that the announcement of the 50% reduction in gasoline allocation</p>
<p>is a matter of necessity.</p>
<p>Although it cannot be said that there is no gasoline currently en route to Shanghai, no one knows exactly when it will arrive in the port. It is rumored that the withdrawal of British ships from Shanghai is also one of the main reasons for the 50% reduction in gasoline allocation, but oil company personnel are tight-lipped about it. According to a key official, if no oil arrives in the near future, gasoline companies may be forced to stop selling gasoline to the public. However,</p>
<p>it is too early</p>
<p>to talk about this now. Everything depends on political events within the next two weeks. If the war crisis currently threatening Shanghai is resolved, the gasoline supply problem will become clearer. Furthermore, according to an employee of an American oil company, the company is currently awaiting a telegram from the U.S. head office regarding future gasoline supplies, and the head office is obviously waiting for the political situation in the Far East to become clear before continuing to ship gasoline. The current gasoline reserves in Shanghai are a matter of speculation, with some saying that there is no large-scale hoarding.</p>
<h3>French Concession Renewal of Curfew Permits</h3>
<p>The French Concession Police Department will start renewing curfew permits from the 10th of this month. Applications should be submitted to the department during the following periods: (1) White permits No. 1 to No. 1100, orange permits No. 1 to No. 800, from December 10, 1941, to January 10, 1942; (2) White permits No. 1101 to No. 2200, orange permits No. 801 to No. 1600, from January 10, 1942, to January 31, 1942; (3) White permits No. 2201 and above, and orange permits No. 1601 and above, will be renewed in February. The permit fee (including donations) is 4 yuan per permit, and the validity period is from January 1, 1942, to June 30, 1942.</p>
<h3>Woman Instigates Crowd to Strangle Husband's Brother</h3>
<p>Wang Xiling (42 years old), from Jiancheng, Jiangbei, worked as a horse carriage laborer. Due to the consumption of white flour, his income was insufficient, and he often borrowed money from his younger brother Wang Ximing at No. 3400 South Yinghua Lane, Hed Road, or took the opportunity to steal clothes for pawn. His sister-in-law Wang Shi hated him to the bone. At 5:30 PM on the 2nd of this month, he went to his brother's house again to forcibly borrow money. As the brother was not at home, he argued with his sister-in-law Shi. Shi cried out to her brother Shi Changgen, who came and scolded him. Shi and her brother dragged him to the third floor and used a hemp rope to tie it around his head, pulling it close to the door frame and strangling him to death. Afterwards, they invited neighbors Wang Guozhen from Tianjin and a woman, Shi Chen, to move the body to an abandoned area outside the back door. Later, Western Police Officer No. 259 from the Putuo Road Police Station passed by and discovered it. He alerted the police station, which dispatched an ambulance to rush to the Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was already too late. The body was sent to the Jiaozhou Road morgue. Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to arrest Shi Changgen, Wang Shi, Wang Guozhen, and his brother Wang Ximing (for agreeing to move the body) and take them to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Division 3 of the Special First Court. Police station lawyer Li Zhishan filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law for murder, requesting a postponement. Judge Huang Risheng questioned the defendants and ordered them to be remanded in custody pending further examination of the body.</p>
<h3>British Side Designates Eight Chinese Merchant Banks - Specially Authorized to Engage in Foreign Exchange - Adopting the Same Method as the U.S. Treasury - And Also Approves the Sino-Belgian Bank to Operate</h3>
<p>Following the amendment of General Order No. 59 by the U.S. Treasury Department, specifically authorizing eight Chinese merchant banks in Shanghai to engage in foreign exchange transactions, the British government has also designated eight banks, including Shanghai, Zhejiang Xingye, Zhejiang Shiye, Zhongxing, Guangdong, Jin Cheng, Huaqiao, and Dongya, as specially approved banks, similarly engaging in foreign exchange transactions with the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture, as well as the fourteen Allied banks previously approved. In addition, the Sino-Belgian Bank has also been specially approved to engage in foreign exchange, but the buying and selling prices of foreign exchange (including US dollars or British pounds) shall be handled in accordance with the exchange rates set by the Chinese Stabilization Fund.</p>
<p>Recommended by British and American Committee Members</p>
<p>All banks specially approved by the British and American governments must cooperate fully with the Chinese Stabilization Fund in order to give effect to the new regulations promulgated by the British and American Treasury Departments, so as to achieve the purpose of cooperation between China, Britain, and the United States. The purpose is to assist the Chinese government in managing foreign exchange and international trade. From now on, the position of the Chinese Stabilization Fund will be further consolidated, and the implementation of the plan will be more effective. It is learned that the new measures promulgated by the British and American governments this time were recommended by Fox, the American member of the Stabilization Fund, and Holbarth, the British member, and were approved for adoption.</p>
<h3>Rent Increase Dispute at YMCA Dormitory - Involving a Rent Increase of More Than 30% - All Residents Appeal for Social Assistance</h3>
<p>The YMCA Sichuan Road Branch dormitory has 890 rooms, divided into single, double, four-person, and dormitory rooms, housing more than 200 residents, mostly students from various schools. Since the Shanghai war, the rent has been increased three times, exceeding more than double the original rent. At the beginning of September this year, the association issued another notice stating that from October 1st, the rent would be uniformly increased by 126/100, or only by 36/100, and all necessary supplies would be canceled, and 10% of the new rent price would be charged for the tea room tip.</p>
<p>Increase in Total Amount</p>
<p>Reaching more than 139%. Therefore, all the residents jointly signed a letter to the board of directors (September 27), requesting the withdrawal of the original proposal to increase the rent, to openly discuss a solution, and elected 11 representatives to be responsible for negotiations. According to the staff, the general secretary Wu Lifu was in charge, but Wu Lifu said that the staff was responsible, pushing each other, and the representatives could not contact to proceed. The residents then submitted all the rent payable to the Special First Court through three representatives. Unexpectedly, the branch staff Sun Yongjia suddenly reported to the Central Police Station that these three representatives who collected the rent and</p>
<p>Submitted to the Court</p>
<p>"Obtained money by fraud" (October 30, there is a case at the Central Police Station). The police station then sent detectives to arrest the three representatives. Later, after the three representatives showed the receipt from the Special First Court, the police station, based on the facts, found that the YMCA staff Sun Yongjia had made a false accusation, and after reprimanding Sun, released the three representatives who had been falsely accused. After this incident, the residents repeatedly requested the distribution of income and expenditure accounts. A week later, the branch staff announced a signed bill, but after detailed investigation by the residents, it was found that the quantities and prices were inflated a lot. Just taking the item of hot water for washing face as an example, only two hours are provided every morning, but it consumes as much as five tons of coal per month. Moreover, according to</p>
<p>the staff, Kailuan coal oil is used for supply, but it is not enough, so it needs to be purchased externally. It has been investigated and found that Kailuan supplies a total of 50 tons per month, and there is no reason to purchase it externally. Moreover, the price of Kailuan coal in October was only 170-180 yuan per ton, and in November it was 226 yuan, while the staff's account was as high as 800 yuan per ton, an inflation of four times. Calculated in this way, each person needs 92 cents for one wash. At about 12 noon the day before yesterday (November 3), the branch staff Sun Yongjia suddenly led the tea room to dismantle the bed of resident Ji Weihong at No. 69</p>
<p>(at this time, Mr. Ji was away on business and not in the dormitory), and arbitrarily moved his private belongings together. After the resident returned in the evening and learned of this unexpected incident, he negotiated with branch staff Sun Yongjia, but Mr. Sun avoided meeting him and reported to the police station for a factual investigation. It is heard that tenant Ji has filed a lawsuit with the Special First Court yesterday, demanding compensation for losses, while all the tenants are working together to fight for their rights based on reason, and at the same time appeal to impartial people in society for assistance.</p>
<h3>Newspaper Vendor Shot and Injured by Japanese Soldiers on the Way to Sell Newspapers</h3>
<p>Newspaper vendor Hua Tugen from Nantong, 39 years old, lived at No. 7 Languifang, Lan Road, Yangshupu, Hudong, Shanghai, and made a living by selling newspapers. At about 8:30 AM yesterday, Hua obtained various Japanese newspapers and carried them</p>
<p>to sell them by calling out the news. Unexpectedly, when he reached the intersection of Kunming Road near Zhoushan Road, he was shot by a Japanese sentry stationed there. He was shot in the left calf, the bullet pierced through the bone, and he fell to the ground in a pool of blood. The Huishan Police Station discovered it and summoned an ambulance to rush him to the Huadong Shengyuan Hospital for treatment. By about 9:00 AM, the Japanese suddenly sent personnel to the hospital and took Hua Tugen away.</p>
<p>Rewards for Chinese Detectives Who Contributed to Apprehending Thieves</p>
<p>Chinese Detectives No. 159 and No. 2318 of the Public Concession Police Station, due to their meritorious service in apprehending thieves, were approved by the bureau through the Rewards Committee to each receive a second-class special merit medal as a reward.</p>
<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I have read the news article "Accusations of Public Insult Due to Housing Disputes" published in your newspaper's local news column on the 2nd of this month, which does not conform to the facts. My client, Zhao Binglin, previously rented the downstairs house at No. 9 Guizhou Road from Zhang Lianting and opened the Jiatai Transportation Company. Suddenly, on the 4th of last month, he was instigated by Zhang Lianting and Lei Xiaofu to use violence and coercion to drive out his family members and employees, and sealed the store door, hindering people from exercising their rights. He filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai First Special District Court, which has already sentenced the offenders (30th year, Zi Zi Yu No. 55 Cave). Therefore, the statement that Ming Jiatai Company withdrew all its assets and account books, etc., and did not pay the rent is not true. Moreover, my lawyer is exercising his duties based on the intentions of the client and the facts stated. It is obviously harmful to my lawyer's reputation to publicly list my lawyer as a defendant. In addition to proceeding according to law, I would like to ask your newspaper to make corrections to show the truth. Sincerely, Lawyer Song Yaoji, December 3, 30th year.</p>
<p>To the Editor: I have read the news article with the headline "Accusations of Public Insult Due to Housing Disputes" on the seventh page of the second section of your issue No. 24,331 on the 2nd of this month, which stated that "Lawyer Song Yaoji and his client Zhao Binglin were recently sued by Lei Xiaofu through lawyers Wang Yaotang, Qian Zheng, and Zhao Zuwei in the Criminal Court of the Special First Court for false accusations and defamation," which is completely inconsistent with the facts. In the case of Zhao Binglin suing Zhang Lianting and Lei Xiaofu for obstructing rights, my three lawyers defended the defendants Zhang Lianting and Lei Xiaofu. As for the case of Lei Xiaofu suing Zhao Binglin and Song Yaoji for false accusations and defamation, my lawyers did not accept Lei Xiaofu's entrustment to handle it. I hereby send this letter to request corrections. Sincerely, Lawyers Wang Yaotang, Qian Zheng, Zhao Zuwei.</p>
<p>To the Editor: I have read the news article with the headline "Datong News Agency's Rent Dispute Pending Judgment" on the 3rd of this month, which stated that "Unexpectedly, Wang Runtao, due to the recent lack of housing and high prices, dug up someone to coerce tenants to move out," which is completely inconsistent with the facts. I sued the Datong News Agency because the agency violated the lease agreement by subletting the house to others, which led to my involvement in the lawsuit. The evidence is true, and the high-priced digging is completely fabricated and slanderous. I hereby send this letter to request corrections. Sincerely, Wang Runtao.</p>

<p>(Guilin Aviation News) The Guangxi Branch of the Chinese Gliding Association held its first board meeting at 1:00 PM on the 7th of last month in the new dormitory building of the Lequn Society. More than ten people attended, including Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi, Chairman Huang Xuchu, Chief of Staff Xu Qiming, Secretary General Liu Shiheng, Director Huang Jie, Commander Xie Mang, Director Su Xixun, Mayor Chen Enyuan, Director Cheng Siyuan, Deputy Director Wei Zan, and Instructor Tang Weidinglie. Chairman Huang Xuchu presided over the meeting, beginning with a speech stating that young people in various parts of the province were very interested in gliding. When he met with Speaker Li Renren in Rong County, Speaker Li said that young people everywhere were enthusiastically donating money for gliders. Therefore, he slightly anticipated that gliding sports in the province would surely develop smoothly in the future.</p>
<p>Deputy Chief of Staff Bai's Instructions: Subsequently, Deputy Chief of Staff Bai gave two instructions. First, he hoped that the branch would establish a manufacturing plant to expedite the production of gliders, so that each county in the province would have a glider and establish a sub-branch. Second, he hoped that when the central government recruits students for glider training, it would allocate quotas to each province, so that after graduation, they would return to their original provinces to serve, which would facilitate the work. Then, concurrently serving Director Gan Shi Zantang reported on the preparations for the establishment of the branch. After the speech, the proposals were discussed, and the resolutions are as follows:</p>
<p>Resolved Important Cases: (1) The standing directors of the branch are nominated as Su Xixun, Chen Enyuan, Xie Mang, Cheng Siyuan, and Wei Zantang. Su Xixun is also nominated as the chairman of the standing board. (2) The grand parade ground outside the South Gate is designated as the elementary gliding field of the branch. The design of the field will be decided after the General Association sends technical personnel to Guilin. The expenses will be submitted by the branch to the General Association for verification and disbursement. (3) The location of the parachute tower will be initially built in the sports field for the elementary level and in the grand parade ground for the advanced level. The General Association is requested to send personnel to design it. (4) The branch's address will be temporarily borrowed from the Youth League headquarters. It will be rebuilt when funds permit. (5) The branch's manufacturing plant should be planned and established by personnel sent by the General Association to Guilin. (6) The branch's members should be recruited in accordance with Articles 13 of the branch's charter and should be carried out as soon as possible. (7) The member training plan should be submitted to the General Association, requesting the dispatch of educational cadres and materials to Guilin for preparation. (8) The work plan and budget will be prepared by the standing committee. After the discussion, the meeting adjourned at around 3:00 PM. At 4:00 PM, Chairman Huang hosted a dinner at the Lequn Society. At 6:00 PM, Deputy Chief of Staff Bai hosted all the directors to watch the play "Loyal King Li Xiucheng".</p>
<p>Performing in Various Regions: Deputy Chief of Staff Bai plans to invite the gliding personnel who came to Guilin this time to perform in various regions. However, their travel leave is about to expire, and they will soon return to Chengdu. The branch and Deputy Chief of Staff Bai urgently sent telegrams to the Military Affairs Commission, the Director of the Military and Political Office, and Director Huang, extending the time for their travel leave so that they can perform in various regions.</p>
<p>Xin Zhong Donates One Aircraft: The Guangxi Branch of the Chinese Gliding Association has been very active in its work since its establishment on the 4th. Many people from all walks of life are happy to support it. According to the person in charge of the branch speaking to the reporter, in addition to the "Dagong Daily No. 2" donated by the Dagong Daily for the use of the Guilin branch, Director Zhang Guorui donated a glider to the association. The aircraft will be named "Xin Zhong" (New China). The branch plans to order it from the General Association immediately, and the naming ceremony will be held in Guilin soon.</p>

<h3>Second Act of the West Youth Basketball League: Fuli Lian Miserably Loses to Giants Yesterday, Group B Storm and Tongren Triumph, All Three Games Result in One-Sided Victories</h3>
<p>The second act of the West Youth Basketball League began last night. In the two Group B games, Tongren Yijia Ban easily defeated Chen You 38-17, with the first half being 23-3, a one-sided process. In the next game, Storm defeated Ling You 38-11, with the first half being 23-4, also a one-sided situation. The main event of the evening was the Group A battle between Fuli Lian and Giants. Fuli Lian made its debut in a brand-new posture. Fuli Lian was originally composed of old players from Xufang, with no outsiders in the team. The name Fuli Lian also takes the meaning of restoring the old business and reuniting friendships. However, some mistakenly thought that it was composed of Fudan alumni, which led to a large number of Fudan alumni requesting to join in recent days, much to the dismay of the host, Mr. Dong Xiaopei. In yesterday's game, Fuli Lian showed an unusual performance. Tao, Zou, Dong (Yangfeng), and others' skillful shots were repeatedly unsuccessful. Many good opportunities were missed by a hair's breadth. Giants took advantage of the favorable situation and had a smooth ride, easily defeating Fuli Lian 28-12. The game began with Smith scoring a free throw to open the record. Sha Sijin and Yelong scored seven points in one breath. Tao Shaosheng forced his way through the siege and finally scored. After 11-2, Dong Yangfeng broke through the basket, and the first half ended with 11-4. Fuli Lian was far behind. In the second half, Giants added six points in one breath. Dong Yangfeng fouled out four times and was sent off. Song Qihou was brought on, but Fuli Lian still showed no improvement. Giants' score soared. Fuli Lian finally suffered a惨 defeat with 12-28.</p>

<h3>Uncertainty in Sino-Japanese-American Peace Talks, Gold Market Fluctuates Irregularly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash gold market in Shanghai fluctuated and rose, with prices surpassing the 15,000 yuan mark. With the Sino-Japanese-American talks on the verge of collapse, the market was confused by conflicting bullish and bearish news. US dollar notes rose to around 30 yuan, and everyone was consistently bullish. Supply and demand in the secret market were evenly matched. Tianyuan squeezed in 830 taels, and draft merchants and securities firms each squeezed in around 350 taels. Gonghe, Shihe, and Mingfeng's squeezing was also strong. However, Chengji and Shunyuan each sold 400 taels, Yongcheng sold over 500 taels, and Xianghe, Lianxing, Tongkangyong each sold about 200 taels, causing the price to rise from 14,300 yuan to 15,500 yuan before falling back. The market closed with a squeeze of 770 yuan. A total of 20,960 taels were traded throughout the day. Ornaments made from gold rose 90 yuan, while silver remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Cash Rushes Past 15,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The market opened at 9:00 AM at 14,400 yuan per bar (10 taels), 30 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day. When Tianyuan, Xianghe Securities Firm, Cash Firm, Hesheng, and others bought in, it immediately rebounded by 350 yuan to 14,750 yuan. Chengji, Wanli, Mingfeng Securities Firm, Tianjin Gang, Xianghe, Xiangxing, and Yonglai forcefully sold, immediately causing it to drop by 450 yuan to 14,300 yuan. When news came that US dollar notes were rising and foreign exchange was softening, it triggered a buying frenzy. Tianyuan, Xiangxing, Yong Mingfeng, Gonghe, Shihe, draft merchants, and securities firms successively absorbed the supply, and the price gradually increased. It was especially strong at noon, suddenly breaking through 15,000 yuan, reaching 15,300 yuan. The market closed at noon at 15,280 yuan. In the afternoon, it immediately raised by 220 yuan to 15,500 yuan. Tianyuan, Hongqing, Yongcheng, and Dalai forcefully sold, and Yongcheng dumped its supply, causing the price to suddenly drop by 550 yuan to 14,950 yuan. Draft merchants, securities firms, Hesheng, Gonghe, and Mingfeng successively entered forcefully, increasing it by 400 yuan to 15,350 yuan. Yongcheng, Xiangxing, Yongxianghe, and Tianyuan forcefully sold again, falling back to 15,050 yuan. Tianyuan re-entered, and Deda closed at 15,200 yuan, a recovery of 770 yuan compared to the previous day, with a difference of 1,200 yuan. The cash firm's own-brand gold was sold at 15,400 yuan at the store, with the purchase price being 1,000 yuan lower than the selling price.</p>
<p>Gold Ornaments in Jewelry Stores Also See Squeeze</p>
<p>The selling price of gold ornaments in jewelry stores, both Datongxing and Xintongxing, initially rose by 30 yuan in the morning, and then rose again by 80 yuan twice to 1,580 yuan before falling back to 1,540 yuan. Finally, it closed at 1,560 yuan (purchase price reduced by 150 yuan), a recovery of 90 yuan. Silver was still listed at 22 yuan, with the black market at 17 or 18 yuan.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Notes Likely to Reach 30 Yuan, Black Market Exchange Rate Tightens</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the official rates quoted by the Central Bank and HSBC. The exchange rates of 14 foreign and Chinese banks were also stable. The black market exchange rates for British and American currencies continued to tighten sharply. US dollar notes broke through the 30 yuan mark. Importers were eager to settle their accounts, and Chinese merchants took the opportunity to raise prices. As a result, the British exchange rate softened to 1/25 or possibly settled. Some importers who were not allowed to apply for US$3.375 settled at a premium. There were few transactions in the first half of the day. Compared to the previous day's closing prices, both British and American currencies squeezed tighter by 125. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds rise sharply by 20 yuan along with the price of cash gold. British gold notes soared by 10 yuan, and US dollar notes were likely to reach the 30 yuan mark, with the final rate being 29 yuan and 8 jiao, a recovery of 1 yuan and 3 jiao compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes fell by 1 jiao. Canadian notes and Philippine notes both trended upward. Japanese gold notes and Korean military notes trended downward. The former was 2 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, the middle was 2 yuan and 5 jiao, and the latter was 3 yuan, 4 jiao, and 5 fen.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 3rd (Wednesday): This morning, the foreign exchange market opened abnormally sluggish. All exchange rates remained unchanged. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tianjin, 3rd (Wednesday): This morning, the foreign exchange market opened stable. All exchange rates stood at their original rates without any upward or downward movement.</p>
<h3>Gold Is To Blame, Yarn Market Fluctuates Accordingly</h3>
<p>The yarn market's trend is calm and stable, but most people are bearish because the amount of short selling is sufficient. However, large investors are still buying in, given that the gold, Shuangma futures, and gold are all firm and expensive, and they are struggling on the bullish side, so the swirling force is exceptionally strong. Comparing the yarn prices of other exchanges, Bianma is unique. However, the Bianma market is still loose and weak. The high price for 20-count Shuangma yarn is 2,485 yuan, and the low price is 2,395 yuan. The market opened in the afternoon with a sharp rise. The opening price was 2,565 yuan. However, as soon as the high price appeared, it immediately went down, falling to 2,455 yuan. However, taking the lead of the yarn market, it gradually rose and then rebounded to 2,485 yuan. However, the leading side is still short, and it loosened to 2,435 yuan. The closing price was 2,443 yuan, 45 yuan outside the market.</p>
<p>Shuangma opened very flat in the morning. The opening price was 2,420 yuan. After a short time, due to short covering, it rose to 2,450 yuan. Afterwards, it went down slightly after the exchange opened, and the short side was active again, with more selling pressure, falling to 2,395 yuan. However, as the price was weak, buyers' enthusiasm was strong, and it rose again to 2,440 yuan, swirling for a long time. By the time the market closed, with the price of gold rising, the short side covered its positions, and the market gradually rose to close at 2,472 yuan. It was found that the half-day turnover was statistically 2,950 bales.</p>
<p>Gold Bianma futures, from continued decline to recovery, the situation is still floating and uncertain. The reason is that the international trend has been unpredictable recently. The complexity of the news makes it difficult to choose. Therefore, there is no sign of emphasis on the trend. When it opened in the morning, although the Yanghua performance was strong, the factory orders tended to be weak first. Therefore, under the influence of the general reliance on spot yarn, December only opened at 2,480 yuan, and January opened at 2,550 yuan, which was already stable. February initially opened at 2,630 yuan, initially showing a hard state. By the time of the second round, it was appropriate that the exchange and factory orders once again hovered and fell. The bullish side was even more apprehensive. Under the dumping by the gold firms and securities firms, it once fell to the low end of the day. Unexpectedly, when it was close to the noon closing, the gold market suddenly rose sharply, and both spot yarn and futures yarn rose in line with each other, picking up about 30 to 40 yuan in the closing of each month's period. In the afternoon, the firm rise in the exchange caused the bullish side to be firm. The market atmosphere still saw a slight increase under the absorption of retail investors. However, due to the situation, it was not very stable. The result of the rise and fall throughout the day was that each month's period rose by more than 20 yuan to 50 yuan. The list is as follows,</p>
<p>November January February</p>
<p>Opening 2480.0 2550.0 2630.0</p>
<p>Highest 2515.0 2600.0 2670.0</p>
<p>Lowest 2438.0 2510.0 2595.0</p>
<p>Closing 2500.0 2600.0 2635.0</p>
<p>Comparison Rise 40.0 Rise 50.0 Rise 34.0</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Market Stable</h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation is flat, but with gold trending upward, cargo owners' constitutions are more secure.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market saw prices rise due to buying from Wall Street and the textile industry. Yesterday's closing prices were up about 14 or 5 pounds from the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially fell due to short selling by cotton merchants, but subsequently rose due to buying by a large number of speculators and the situation in the Far East not being very bad. As a result, yesterday's closing prices each rose by about 3 or 4 sibi.</p>
<h3>Although Government Bonds See Recovery, the Situation Still Seeks Stability</h3>
<p>The government bond gray market saw a lot of turbulence yesterday but did not diminish its hesitant state. It was up 7 or 8 jiao in the morning and suddenly down 8 or 9 jiao in the afternoon, indicating that people's hearts were abnormally flustered. In this time of complex news, both bulls and bears felt helpless. In the afternoon, there were bearish rumors in the foreign business community, such as the Hong Kong HSBC Bank moving to Singapore, which further dampened people's spirits. Government bonds were already in a weak state, so how could they withstand the attack of rumors? Yesterday morning, in the slow price increases of Lianyi, Tongyi, Xiexing, Yuangong, Mao, etc., they gradually trended higher. Type C saw over 68 yuan and 7 jiao, but it failed to stand firm due to the selling of Tongsheng Shunxing. People's hearts suddenly emptied in the afternoon, and Shengxing continued to sell. Type C opened suddenly, breaking 8 yuan to 67 yuan and 8 jiao. Afterwards, because Tongkang Juxin had some demand, it recovered two or three jiao. The result was still up one or two jiao to six jiao. Type D did not open proudly in the afternoon. The turnover was about 1.45 million yuan. Here is a brief table:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 200 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 39 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>The opening of the public stock market was slightly higher, but then gradually declined because buyers lacked support and sellers sold as soon as prices were high. As a result, the prices of both stocks were similar to the closing prices of the previous day.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Slightly Swirl, Soon Soaring Upward</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth Yesterday's market swirled, loosened in the morning, and gradually rose in the afternoon. As a result, coarse cloth rose 9 jiao to 1 yuan compared to the previous day, fine cloth diagonal lines rose about 1 yuan, and some dyed cloth rose 1 or 2 yuan. Huadie coarse cloth Nongkai fell 5 jiao, gradually decreasing to 90 yuan and 5 jiao. It rebounded to 91 yuan and 7 jiao and a half at noon. In the afternoon, it rose from 92 yuan to close at 93 yuan, a recovery of 5 jiao compared to the previous day. The turnover in the street was over 300 pieces of coarse cloth, blue cloth, line neirong cloth, etc., and over 100 pieces of coarse cloth color cloth, etc. from the Zhejiang East gang.</p>
<p>Dong Cloth The most swirling market atmosphere is mediocre, and sales are trending downward. The market rose quickly due to gold prices rising and bullish rumors spreading. The closing price of the exchange's Caiqiu fine cloth futures for this month was 86 yuan, and January was 89 yuan, both rising 1 yuan from the previous day. February was 91 yuan, rising 1 yuan and a half. The leading fine cloth factory order in the spot market swirled at 89 yuan for a long time in the morning and also rose to 90 yuan and 5 jiao at closing in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Flour Price Fixed at 40 Yuan</h3>
<p>—Plus a Fee of Two Jiao—</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign flour market was stable. Because the Public Works Bureau has begun to allocate to actual consumption households and announced the public sale price of 40 yuan plus a fee of 2 jiao, some actual consumption is no longer being absorbed from the market, and even scattered customers who actually consume no longer wait and see but inquire about the market. Holders of goods have no opportunity to attempt to raise prices and no worries about unified low sales, so they also sell with the market. Therefore, the market situation is very stable. Xizhan registered Jinlong has stood at a price of about 40 yuan, up to 41 yuan. However, due to the need for customers to store and export the various powders from Dongzhan that have been approved for re-export, the selling price still needs to be outside of 50 yuan. Bran only opened at 3 gold coins, a small package of 54 yuan and a half, about 200 or 300 packages. Wheat inventories have reached a point of exhaustion, and Durke wheat is shouting 73 or 4 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil and Grains, Speculators Still Control</h3>
<p>The market situation for miscellaneous grains and oil cakes remained consistently high yesterday. Because the actual sales were still not bleak, those who held the goods were trying to control the market, so the market continued to rise. As a result, edible oil rose another 5 yuan to 10 yuan, and soybeans and corn both rose 1 or 2 yuan. The total market opened with 50 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 300 cans of Jiangbei raw oil, another 20 barrels, 600 dan of Dayou Factory refined oil, over 200 barrels of Rihua Factory vegetable oil, 100 dan of Dachang New Factory vegetable oil, 2 units each of Lide Taishan Dasheng Factory vegetable oil, 600 packages of Tianjin Xinjinyuan and 300 packages of Chen Jinyuan, another 300 packages of green beans, over 2,000 packages of corn spot goods, and over 500 contracts for futures.</p>
<h3>Sugar Speculators Are Apprehensive, Although Prices Plunge, Transactions Are Still Clear</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw even more bleak sales, and the inventory on hand actually increased daily. Therefore, speculators were extremely apprehensive and sold out in the market, so prices continued to fall by 7 to over 10 yuan. The company's futures for three or four coarse white sugar were priced at 196 yuan to 90 yuan for the tenth date of the month, down 7 yuan, and 294 yuan for the twentieth date, a wide drop of 15 yuan. Spot goods of two or four coarse white imported in November were 204 yuan to 195 yuan and a half, 96 yuan and 7 yuan in the afternoon, 4 yuan and a half, and 8 yuan and a half, 198 yuan in October. 94 yuan, 92 or 3 yuan in the afternoon, 10 yuan, 197 yuan in September. 93 yuan, 88 yuan and 85 yuan in the afternoon, 183 yuan in August, the same price in the afternoon, 176 yuan for Hong Kong coarse sugar, and 7 yuan, 168 yuan for Dutch red sugar, 63 yuan in the afternoon, and 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Can Be Transported, Those with Official Stamps Are Especially Popular</h3>
<p>Cigarettes continued to gradually increase in price. The reason is that the factory lacks raw materials, and the goods distributed to the same industry cannot be supplied in large quantities. Furthermore, because of the government's price restrictions, cigarettes are not included in this exception. Therefore, those who hold goods wait for a good price to sell. Recently, because transportation permits have been issued, Hakka gangs have been searching for all kinds of goods with official stamps in the market. Because workers at each machine in Maotai are on strike, the goods stored with the above items cannot be cleared, so the spot goods are mostly in short supply. Prices such as Big Ben cigarettes are 2,990 yuan per case, Lao Dao brand stamped at 2,850 yuan, Fairy brand at 1,790 yuan, Wuhua brand at 1,880 yuan, and Pinhai brand at 2,110 yuan, all trending higher than the previous day. Daily necessities such as matches, soap, candles, etc. have temporarily passed peacefully, feeling slightly chic. Because the factory has news of price increases,</p>
<h3>Noodles Rise Too Much, Naturally, They Cannot but Fall</h3>
<p>The reason why filament noodles were raised so much earlier is that Longkou noodles reached 460 or 70 yuan, which can be said to be the highest possible. Recently, with the price of goods mostly turning downward, this is an exception even though it is a product to be sold in the winter. The price is softening, and it has fallen by dozens of yuan before and after. Yesterday's market saw Longkou noodles sold for 400 yuan, with the rest returning.</p>
<h3>Black Iron Billets Suddenly Show Their Edge: Originally Valued at Around $11,000 per Bundle</h3>
<p>Black iron billets, due to the rush by the Fujianese to purchase them, coupled with the interruption of supplies from Hong Kong, suddenly shone in the market, which was characterized by scant inventory and a sluggish atmosphere. As a result, asking prices rose again. It is reported that yesterday, a 2,000-pound bundle was originally valued at around $11,000, while 200-pound assorted varieties were selling for as much as $1,100 to $1,150 per case, an increase of $1,000 and $150 respectively compared to the previous market.</p>

<h3>Moscow Then and Now</h3>
<p>— He Kai</p>
<p>In recent years, the speed of Moscow's transformation in appearance has been astonishing. A visit to Western European cities after ten or twenty years rarely reveals any signs of change. This is because those cities were mostly built long ago.</p>
<p>However, Moscow has leaped from a large village to become a modern, so-called socialist central city. The speed of its transformation is naturally beyond the imagination of ordinary people.</p>
<p>The Russian writer Kuprin, who fled abroad after the revolution, returned to his hometown of Moscow after more than a decade. Standing in the center of the city, he couldn't help but exclaim, "This is not Moscow!" In fact, Moscow has completely changed its appearance, making it unrecognizable to those who knew it in the past.</p>
<p>More than a decade ago, Moscow had a population of only about two million, but today it has surged to four and a half million. This shows the extent to which Moscow has expanded in this short period. In the city center, the low-rise butcher shops and vegetable stores that once lined Gorky Street have been swept away, replaced by Europe's largest ten-story hotel, the "Moskva Hotel," and the People's Committee Building, made of dark gray marble. Moscow's "Nanjing Road" - Gorky Street - has had the buildings on both sides demolished in turn, greatly widening the road, turning the curved road into a straight one, and building a square in the center of the road. In short, Moscow has been completely transformed into a modern city.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union also built Moscow's first subway, which is known as the largest in the world, with a depth of up to seventy meters. The interiors of each station are large and lined with columns, truly deserving of the title "Underground Palace."</p>
<p>The Moscow River, which forms a W-shape around the city, has a scarce water supply. Therefore, the authorities built the Moscow-Volga Canal, introducing the abundant waters of the Volga River. As a result, Moscow has gradually acquired the appearance of a large city.</p>
<p>The transformation of Moscow is based on the "Moscow Reconstruction Ten-Year Plan" passed in 1935. According to this plan, the new Moscow will seek to preserve the basic outline of Moscow, which has a history of development, while fundamentally transforming the streets and squares in order to build a modern city.</p>
<p>The area of old Moscow was 28,500 hectares, while the area of new Moscow is 60,000 hectares, almost two and a half times larger. The suburbs of Moscow will also be attached to the city of Moscow, building a brand-new city of 16,000 hectares.</p>
<p>However, a ten-kilometer diameter of forest land will remain around Greater Moscow, and new forest zones will be established where there is no forest. As for housing, there are no plans to build skyscrapers as shocking as those in New York, nor to build two-story houses or bungalows for a single family. It is planned to build exquisite six- to eight-story apartments.</p>
<p>As part of this ten-year plan, the subway was completed several years ago, and other projects are also being implemented step by step. Unfortunately, war suddenly broke out at this time, leaving Moscow with no time to complete this plan. If it could be given a few more years, Moscow would surely have become the most modern city in the world.</p>

<h3>Environment</h3>
<p>— Gao Yang</p>
<p>We often hear people say that growing up in a good environment can cultivate useful talents; in a bad environment, social scum can be created.</p>
<p>In fact, this statement is also very vague. Where exactly is the standard of "good" and "bad"? What should be used as a benchmark? I think that today, at least these two principles should be used to distinguish between good and bad.</p>
<p>First, one must be worthy of the country, the nation, and humanity, and every move must not deviate from this scope.</p>
<p>Second, one must actively transform, rather than passively endure.</p>
<p>In this way, we first determine the distinction between "good" and "bad." As long as we do not deviate from these two principles, then the "bitterness" and "sweetness" of the environment do not matter much—as long as they do not violate the above two points.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the eyes of some people, dancing, gambling, drinking, and whoring are good environments; while fighting in ice and snow, wind and rain, is too bad in their eyes. In fact, we say: the former are昏庸people, the蛀蟲of society; the latter are 肉搏 the environment for everyone's survival. This is for the country, the nation, and it is also active.</p>
<p>Of course, we do not deny that the environment can affect a person's thoughts and actions. For example, parents who like to gamble often bring their children to watch gambling, and as a result, it creates a gambling mentality and behavior in the children. Furthermore, when two children with different treatments are in the same family, it will cause a poor child to steal. Even adults are always like this, in the same professional field, or a circle of life, it can create a certain kind of people, the so-called "near vermilion, one gets stained red; near ink, one gets stained black", its principle is in this!</p>
<p>However, we cannot admit that only the environment controls people, while ignoring people's ability to control the environment, and even the great power to create the environment. First, we must distinguish between "good" and "bad" according to the above principles. This requires first relying on our own understanding to distinguish the environment in which we are located, and not allowing it to reverse black and white, and confuse our minds. Second, no matter how bad the environment we are in, we should make up our minds that it is like a ship sailing in the ocean, which needs a "helmsman" with a firm will. We want to drive the environment, not be driven by the environment so that we are triumphant, but do not know where we are going!</p>
<p>Therefore, we say that we must be the masters who overcome the environment, use the environment, and control the environment, and never be puppets of the environment, idols of the environment! And more importantly:</p>
<p>——We must be the warriors who create the environment!</p>

<h3>Bicycle for Treating Illnesses</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiao</p>
<p>A young man suffering from infantile paralysis was able to regain muscle control with the help of an exercise device created by his father, allowing him to stay out of the "iron lung" all day. This instrument is made of lead-painted long and short tubes, with three hinged gears, a chain, foot pedals, and hand grips. When he holds the hand grips with both hands, he steps on the foot pedals with his feet, which helps the development of his arm muscles. There are many exercise devices currently being tested to help patients with infantile paralysis, and this is just one example.</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Fifteen Dad, Let's Go Busking!</p>
<p>"Dad, if you still consider me your daughter, please don't do this kind of business anymore!" She expressed her opposition in a very firm tone.</p>
<p>"If we don't eat this kind of food, are we just going to drink the northwest wind?" Autumn Begonia asked, shrugging his hands, appearing helpless.</p>
<p>"It won't come to that," Mei Shi put down a qing cloth dagua she was mending and said with a serious expression: "I've studied for seven or eight years after all, and I still have some skills to make a living. No matter what, I won't just sit by and watch our father and daughter starve to death."</p>
<p>Autumn Begonia lowered his head, sitting on the edge of the kang, listening to his daughter's crisp words, and felt extremely uncomfortable. At most fourteen or fifteen years ago, Luo Xiangqi also used this tone to discuss family affairs with him, but now there is no news of her!</p>
<p>"For the past two or three months, you have been so tired for the life of our father and daughter. If I am still ignorant, I can't let you go out and work hard alone!" Mei Bao frowned tightly and said very sadly.</p>
<p>"But, Shanghai is too terrible! Letting a girl like you go out and mix around, I really can't put my heart down." Autumn Begonia slowly raised his head, looked at Mei Bao, and said with a sad face.</p>
<p>The lamplight shone on his face, and only a thin, withered yellow skin could be seen. (279)</p>

<h3>New York Sunday Mirror Movie Selection: Errol Flynn and Bette Davis Elected</h3>
<p>— Lian</p>
<p>Best Picture... Gone with the Wind</p>
<p>The New York Sunday Mirror, with a daily circulation of 3.5 million, recently held a special movie election to select the best male and female actors of the year and "the best movie I think is from September 1940 to March 1941." Voters were all readers of the newspaper. As a result, Errol Flynn was elected as the best male actor, and Bette Davis won the title of best female actor. I think the movie fans in Shanghai have already made a judgment on the acting skills of these two artists.</p>
<p>In this election, no fewer than 262 film artists received votes. Errol Flynn's votes were 16,714, which was 937 votes more than Clark Gable, who came in second. Bette Davis received 22,010 votes, which was 6,465 votes more than Diana Durbin, who came in second.</p>
<p>The best twelve male film artists are as follows: (1) Errol Flynn, (2) Clark Gable, (3) Tyrone Power, (4) Spencer Tracy, (5) Nelson Eddy, (6) Kim Auclaire, (7) Miguel Ronn, (8) Ray Milland, (9) Robert Taylor, (10) Cary Grant, (11) Gary Cooper (12) Bob Hope</p>
<p>The best twelve female film artists are as follows: (1) Bette Davis, (2) Diana Durbin, (3) Tyja Lynn, (4) Jean Cagisse, (5) Alice Faye, (6) Irene Dunne, (7) Jenny MacDonald (8) Lana Turner, (9) Dorothy Lamour, (10) Vivien Leigh, (11) Olivia de Havilland, (12) Betty Grable.</p>
<p>Miguel Ronn, who was so popular last year, only ranked seventh this year, which was quite unexpected for most people. Kim Auclaire, a martial arts film star, is very popular with movie fans in small towns in the United States, so he ranked sixth. As for Hedy Lamarr, Joan Crawford, Bing Crosby, and Don Ameche, who have always had good acting skills and many movie fans, they were not on the list, which was also unexpected by most people. "Gone with the Wind" was elected as the best film.</p>
<h3>Perfumed Letter Tears Before the Performance</h3>
<p>— Jiang Qi</p>
<p>"Perfumed Letter Tears" will be performed by the China Travel Troupe at Tiangong tonight, which brings me great comfort.</p>
<p>In terms of personal friendship, I am happy for my old friend Tao Qin's debut performance, but what makes me happy is that in the Chinese drama scene, which has been plagued by script shortages for years, a new and powerful playwright has now been added.</p>
<p>Its choice of material and writing skills will naturally be criticized by discerning audiences. There is no need for me to introduce it here first, but what I want to introduce is Tao Qin's humble writing attitude and the courage to overcome setbacks.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the performance is successful or not, I know that the author has exhausted his efforts. "Perfumed Letter Tears" was completed very early, and it has been rewritten several times, and opinions from many friends have been solicited and added or deleted repeatedly. Although this is a spirit that a playwright should have, as far as I know, there are not many writers who can have this spirit.</p>
<p>The script has been sent out again and again, and has been rejected again and again. This may be because there are some flaws in the writing, or perhaps because the script was written by an unknown person. However, now, it is finally being performed. This is certainly due to Mr. Huaiqiu's lack of contempt for unknown dramas, but Tao Qin's courage to overcome setbacks is equally worthy of our praise.</p>
<p>"Perfumed Letter Tears" is being solemnly performed by the China Travel Troupe this time, starring Ms. Tang Ruoqing, who has been away for a long time, and directed by the famous director Bu Wancang. In addition to my old friend feeling supreme comfort, I hope he can always retain the attitude and spirit of writing at this time, and give us more great and more beneficial dramas for our nation in the near future.</p>

<h3>Blood Rain Qiongpa</h3>
<p>— Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 19 Sunset, the Hordes of Riders Fill the City with Dust</p>
<p>In several other places, he often avoided me, and never wanted to live with anyone. Even close as I am, he would not let me touch his skin. Now, because of his leg injury, I have just washed and applied medicine for him, but he is so shy, how can it not make people suspicious? Also, his smile is very charming, and does not resemble a man's attitude, which makes me often daydream. Xu Jing thought, Liu Yinying revealed half of his face from the quilt and looked at Xu Jing, saying: "Brother Jing, thank you for helping. You should sit down and rest too." Xu Jing said: "I don't need much effort. How does your leg feel?" As he spoke, he sat down on the edge of the kang. Liu Yinying said: "After applying the medicine, I feel a little cooler and don't feel pain. This medicine is very good. You should put it away, it may be useful in the future." Xu Jing nodded and said yes. He also said: "At first, I was very worried when I saw you hit by an arrow, but now I am much relieved. The army will be mobilized the day after tomorrow, and you will probably be able to go with the army." Liu Yinying said: "I have a minor injury, and with such good medicine, I will naturally recover faster. I will get up tomorrow. We are in the army, entering and exiting the battlefield, these small injuries are not worth worrying about. A man's seven-foot body should be on a horse to kill thieves, and on foot to write reports. In the future, I want to have a big battle with the bandits. If I can capture the King Chuang, I will not only avenge the country, but also quickly fulfill my heart." Xu Jing listened to Liu Yinying's generous and enthusiastic words, and felt that if Liu Yinying was a daughter, how could he have such strong martial arts? Secondly, he has a strong sense of patriotism and chivalry, and he is indeed a strange man. It was only then that he would say such words, and he did not seem like a skirt-wearing person. (325)</p>
