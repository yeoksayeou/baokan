<h3 id="c10">歐洲搏鬬的析視 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>巴爾幹戰爭結束了。這在整個戰局裏，並沒有最後的決定作用；在英國，並非最後的勝敗關頭；但是我們不能因此而忽略了這一戰爭的重要性。很明顯，巴爾幹戰爭一天繼續，德義就一天被迫在東西兩綫同時作戰；義大利的側翼，就一天在嚴重的威脅之中；英倫三島，地中海，大西洋，以及非洲等地的形勢，也就可以暫時和緩一下；所以英國在巴爾幹的失敗，影響於今後的戰略者，實甚重大。可是巴爾幹戰爭亦不夠判斷兩方力量的優劣。三星期的過程與結果，僅僅證明了兩件事：一是德義陸空聯軍在巴爾幹這一隅佔着優勢，一是英國目前還沒有集中力量，與德義即行決戰的意念和準備。兩方面在陸地與海洋上優劣形勢的對比，本是不可動搖的事實，至於在任何方面的較量，當然受此基本形勢的支配。德義去年可以在陸上擊潰西戰塲的英法聯軍，現在當然也不難擊敗央希南的聯軍於巴爾幹；可是進一步，如果德義尋不到陸上通路，而貿然擴大非洲戰爭，或不顧一切，現在就挑起地中海大戰，及向英倫三島侵襲，則他們的慘敗命運，當然也就早經注定，是不待說的。</p>
<p>在這樣的陸上與海洋對抗形勢之下，英國海軍現在幾乎已經完全控制了環繞歐非兩洲的一切海面，而還可供他加深控制的區域，祇有波羅的海，黑海，及亞得里亞海。另一方面，德義陸軍在歐洲大陸，現在也到了煊赫的最高峯，假如他不向蘇聯烏克蘭及土耳其衝進，則唯一可供牠發揮威力的對象，也就祇剩了伊伯里安半島上的西葡兩國。而且，即使在這些陸海區域內，現在及最近將來的任何可能發展和進退，也還是決定不了兩方面的成敗。所以，兩方面的陸海主力之間，即將出現一種僵持的局面，而不至立即舉行最後的決賽；可是空中戰鬭及軍備的競爭，當然要許多倍的較前加緊起來了。英德近來彼此的大空襲，以及英首相演辭中的强調美國空中機械接濟，那意義就在於此。</p>
<p>當然，僵持並不就是停頓。英德兩方一時雖然無法和對方決戰，但牠們當然要加速彼此陸上和海洋軍備的擴充，以準備那個大決戰來臨的期日；而同時，英國以牠海軍的壓倒優勢，當前所可從事的工作，大概不外於：（一）加緊對歐洲大陸的封鎖，企圖在重要原料及食糧短少的壓力下，使德義戰爭機構漸漸癱瘓，（二）確保本身的海上交通綫，使牠所有殖民地的物產資源，可以源源不絕地組織及納入牠的戰事機構，尤其重要的，是大西洋上對美交通安全的確保。至於德義方面，也勢必要盡量利用自已的一切優點，以進行：（一）以陸軍慢慢潛入非洲或近東，企圖由陸上逐漸瓦解英帝國，（二）趁當前的空軍及潛艇的些微優勢，拚命錘擊英國的海上航運，（三）用盡一切方法，破壞美國接濟的到達英倫三島。</p>
<p>雖然兩方面的成敗，要留待將來實際奮鬥的總結果去解答，現在不必加以預測。但値得指出來的，却是美蘇兩國在這大搏鬥中所起作用的重要。過去美國援助對英的作用且不說，從今以後，牠的作用當然要一天一天的更爲重要起來，甚至可說是掌握了英國全盤勝敗的關鍵。物資上，美國幾乎强於德義兩國的總和。以人口說，也大的相當於德義兩國的總數，縱使以不參戰爲限，牠那一千七百萬的入伍靑年，也以用志願兵等種種方式，投效英軍，以補救英國對德義的一個最大弱點。而對於當前英德在大西洋上控制的爭奪，美國更居於一個舉足重輕的地位。最近美國朝野各方已經明白表示，美國的對英供獻，並不僅以製造戰具爲限，還將負起責任，使牠可以安抵英倫三島。羅斯福堅强地宣稱過，爲了保衛西半球的安全，美國準備把牠的海空巡邏，一直擴充到任何海面。英美海軍密切合作下，德義破壞牠們之間大西洋上交通成功的可能，是很渺小的。再從蘇聯與德義的關係看，縱使撇開將來一切政治關係的演變不論，僅僅經濟與物資上的合作，已經足使英國寄以無限希望的，對德義封鎖的決定效力，成爲畫餅，假定這種狀况繼續下去，那使德義感到致命壓力的期日。就非常的渺遠了。</p>
<p>總之，英國與德義兩方面，雖然都在一面加緊培養自已力量，一面尋覓對方弱點，以便作最後的一擊；但目前美蘇兩國的態度，如果長此不變的話，則在大淸算之前，世界全體就恐怕要注定了挨受長期的痛苦和掙扎。</p>

<p>春秋煤屑的來源  任炯　　往往物價愈貴，而貨色的質地却反愈形拙劣，煤球就是道樣。　　從戰前的七角錢一担，漲到每担國幣十六元，幾乎近二十三倍的比例，這眞够使人駭怕；而且，貨色反在一天不如一天的情形中。　　可是，我們不能抹煞了也有「做好事一的大老　，他爲「窮光蛋」出身的文人士設便官購買煤球的部份，這使在下不能不「哀」並非「衷」字筆誤）心」地表示「感激一。　　最近，爲了煤球實在難以燃燒，就寫了封信給這家煤球廠，結果，收到該廠鉛印的覆信一通，信內實在說得「苦口婆心」，大有「修子修孫」，「修福修壽」之感。　　至於他的煤球火力小的緣故是這樣的：　　「敝廠向以來自越南鴻基屑製造煤球，故火力高强而耐燒，茲因越南形勢之轉變，久無到貨，而存滬鴻基屑業已吿罄，不得已，祇求其有燃料供應市民，使無斷炊之虞，故不惜以高價求普通原料暫製應　，尙祈　貴戶能諒解苦衷，共渡難關，總期環境改變，使我滬市居民早離苦海也。」　　這樣看來，眞所謂「惻隱之心，人皆有之。」——爲了全市居民「無斷炊之虞」，竟而「不借以高價求普通原料暫製應市」。所以偶爾「不得已」而提高價格的話，那末，市民們是不可對他有所「苛求」，而該予以「情有可原　甚至「無限同情」這一手的。至於質地之差，那更不在「話下」；否則，你就是不能「諒解苦衷，共渡難關」了！　　本來，「文人」的筆頭，在幫忙之下，是可以「修飾」得「整齊雅觀」的，「環境」兩字，就是最好的藉口；何况，現今的「交通不便」，似乎就更「名芷言順」了。替老闆們招架，原不過是「應聲蟲」的作風。但是，在下却不甘緘默，而且爲了求事實的「眞相」起見，特地跑到拉都路雷米路附近鴻基煤棧去訪問了一次。　　跨進棧門，不僅觸目皆是堆積如山的鴻基煤塊，煤屑，而且據該棧職員稱：　　「本棧不但從未斷貨，而且每日必有貨色運來！（部份是從浦東裝來的）」　　這才使我惶惶然不知所云，而所謂「存滬鴻基屑業已吿罄」之說，也已由事實加以「否決」了！　　至於「久無到貨」之註解，則更可以本月二十日各報之消息加以證實：「本市運煤專輪和興（譯音）號，由安南鴻基裝載鴻基煤斤五千餘噸，於前日抵滬。當日卸畢，復於次日空輪駛越，繼續裝載煤斤來滬。」而二十一日各報叉復刊登如下消息一則：　　滬中整個煤市，自投機煤業市儈迭次施技後，市况至爲緊俏……記者昨向各煤業公團探悉，海外印度，安南等產區烟白煤塊屑　滬數額已漸見增多，每日到貨平均在五六千噸左右，足供　居民每日燃用。」　　上述消息，並非筆者「杜造」，有全市各報可按，請煤球老闆們除了「有色眼鏡」，看看淸楚，　件起稿諸君，也該　　「聽聽　　」，向壁虛構，究竟不是上策！一塲春夢都落空  英玉　　投機的瓜藤蜿蜒釗了能幹的岑太太家裹。　　四月十七日。「條子」黑市從六千六百多元飛漲了一百元而超越了七百元的大關。　　岑太太本來過着她安適的生活，聽聽無綫電，义义麻將，還有說說張家長，李家短。老頭子遺下來的財產足供吃用，兒子孫子都不用管賬，經濟大　一把抓在手裏，眞是　得享享淸福？　　也不知聽了誰的勸，或者是束也聽得投機賺錢，西也聽得投機賺錢，岑太太的心有點兒熱了。偷偷的我王太太，張太太，還有某太太談話。在「暗盤」六千七百廿五元的時候台做了十條「空頭」。　　於是能幹的岑太太心裏開始擔上了心事了；早上上檔照例必聽的趙效賢的故事，被打人了冷宮，換上的是週波五五〇的報吿行情。　　「棉紗」千　百十一，十二元……條子六千七百廿五，卅元……」的聲音不絕的從無綫電裏傳出來，瀰漫在岑太太的家裏，瀰慢在岑太太的心頭。　　向來不關心事的忽然變得熱心了。（當然，什麽地方火燒，什麽地方强盜搶……那些新聞該是例外。）　　好些好些問題常會從岑太太的口裏問出來。報上的新聞也急切地要叫她的阿囝（她的女兒）說給她聽了。尤其是一個陌生客人來的時候，她更會抓住了追問，像煞是一位「開通」的老太太似的。　　雖然，岑太太急切地關心着她的「條子！但是，有人問起：「岑太太捺做仔幾條？「多頭」呢還是「空頭一？」的時候，她曾推託得一乾兩淨，至多也祇是說：「喔唷，弄弄白相相，六七個人只做仔三四條，蝕煞啊有限未賺煞啊有限！有啥道理。」這末一聲是岑太太常說的，當蒸「有啥道理」，賺着站是「外快」，蝕脫點稍爲有些「肉痛」吧了！　　「條子」慢慢的漲上去，岑太太的眉頭也慢慢的打皺了！「條子」慢慢的小下去，岑太太的肥臉上，也慢慢的有笑容了　　岑太太連打牌的心思都被她的「條子」分去了。一邊打牌，一邊聽報吿行情。當然「心無二用」，顧了這裹，顧不得那裹！倒底還是　條子」的「竄頭勢」足，麻將祇好媽媽虎虎了。於是，岑太太輸了，有限得很，幾塲也祇七八十元。岑太太　例的還是「有哈道理」。「條子」還沒賺錢，麻將倒先輸了：但是，岑太太仍舊「有啥道理」，她相信不久「條子」就要回小，那來賺個兩三百塊錢「有啥道理」。　　但是「條子」事實上倒並不像岑太太理想那樣的小下來，一個謠言，一個謠言的，「條子」慢慢的從六千七白卅元，三十五元……而到了七十元，而且還像是要漲上去的樣子　　岑太太還是照例聽着無綫電，耳朶裏聽着「條子」的上漲而心焦，漲上一些，她心裹也就更難過一些。謠言傳到了岑太太的家裹，她倒相信。於是，她反相信「條子」會更漲的；找着王太太……開了個臨時緊急會議，議決，還是脫手了　　十條「空頭」在六千七百七十元脫手了。　　但是，下半天「條子」跌了，明天還是跌……回到了七百元的關口。　　岑太太乾瞪着眼發呆。　　不知那位，還是「恭維」還是「挖苦」的對着岑太太說：「唷」岑太太眞能幹，「條子」到底小了，岑太太捺　着仔「交關「哉來」？這使岑太太有點哭笑不得；小過她是照例的「有啥道理」像煞的確賺了的樣子　　岑太太的小兒子遭受到了晦氣。「柴杜格人末一眼啊勿乖，只曉得要銅鈿。」岑太太心裏的一股寃氣」發洩在地小兒子身上了。秋海棠  秦瘦鷗　　（七）臉上劃一個十字　　他毫無力氣地退往一張籘榻上去坐着，心是跳得快要離開腔子了，接着那個月洞門裏又奔出了幾個人來；第二個便是袁紹文，滿頭大汗，神態慌張，一看見他，臉色變得更灰白了；第三個就是季兆雄，嘴裏不停的在低聲說話，樣子顯得很興奮，差一些就要向秋海棠笑出來。　　「什麽事這樣忙，七爺？」他立刻站起來問但袁紹文等三個人已急忽忽的穿過院子出去了，他只彷彿看見紹文對他使了一個眼色，一個無可奈何的眼色。　　他正想追上去問個明白，不料那個坐在石階上的小厮，竟很大胆地站起來把他攔住了。　　「吳老板，請你不要出去，大帥馬上有話要給你說咧！」　　這情形是顯然很可怕了。　　「難道季兆雄幾句捕風捉影的話，老袁就會相信嗎？」他急得不住的在屋子裏亂轉，心裹冉也想不出一個計較來。　　一會兒，季兆雄又領着四五個下人回進來了；這一次，他竟毫不客氣地看定着秋海棠發出了一陣充滿着惡意的冷笑，因爲紹文並沒有跟他們一起回進來。　　秋海棠一見他的冷笑，便覺得屋子裹的溫度頓時降到了零度左右去；當他繼續又發現後來的幾個人的手裹有一扇破舊的門板抬着的時候，他的眼前幾乎完全變成一片漆黑了。　　「老張向我做一扇眼色，原來就爲這件事！」緩了一口氣之後，心裹才似乎略略淸醒了一些。（九四）鱗爪  三三　　除了定時的啼叫，公鷄在戰勝時也會登高長鳴的。　　受驚了的野豬是誰也敵不了的。　　牛背上有個凸骨，牠天生給人拉犁的。（但馬呢？）　　孔雀見到了鮮艷的衣服會把牠美麗的翅膀撒開　　被追趕得無路可逃的鴕鳥會將自己的頭埋藏進地下去。　　烏龜的身軀最算是流錢型了，可是却走得最慢　　「緣木求魚」對「肺魚」也是可能的。　　蠖螋的本身無毒，祇是牠喜歡躱在髒的地方。　　黏住臭蟲使牠不能脫身的，就是牠所拼命吸人的血。等於零  覺慧　　限價走一步，「嚴懲」就跟一步，現在弄得究竟多少也不大明白了；反正「沒有」了，不用「庶民同憂」。　　貼價，暗盤，黑市，黑壓壓一片混沌，「天南地北」，非漲即昂，乾脆點束手待斃罷了！　　死，還有比這更好點的嗎？　　不過「人之將死，其言也善。」我們這些餓莩不得不再作一次「哀鳥鳴」。無他……　　家有家規，國有國法；家無規則覆，國無法則亡。「大」如此，「小」亦然。　　一個地方沒有權威，小人盜賊之穴；有權威，言而不行，直等於零！　　零—就是「沒有」。</p>

Among those welcoming them at the airport were representatives such as Vice President Kung, Foreign Minister Wang, US Ambassador Johnson's representative, McHugh, Chinese and foreign journalists, totaling over a hundred people. James, quite tall and energetic, wearing a dark green suit and holding a raincoat, walked out of the airport with the reception staff. Photographers swarmed to take pictures, creating a busy scene. James, in a very welcoming tone, said, "President Roosevelt sends his regards to everyone." Then, Chinese and foreign journalists requested James to make a statement. He then met with reporters in the pilots' lounge, answering their questions in a very amiable manner.</p>
<p>(Question) Does the gentleman bring a letter from President Roosevelt to Chairman Chiang? Does Mrs. Roosevelt also have a letter for Mrs. Chiang?</p>

<p>(Question) What is the mission of this visit to China?</p>
<p>(Answer) I am personally very interested in military affairs and transportation. I am here to study military aspects, but it is purely for learning and not, as rumored, on any advisory mission.</p>
<p>(Question) Before leaving the United States, did the gentleman meet with Dr. Currie to discuss the situation in the Far East?</p>
<p>(Answer) I met with Dr. Currie before leaving Washington, but I did not have the opportunity to read his report to the President on his visit to China.</p>
<p>(Question) Do American newspapers recently frequently publish news about China in prominent positions?</p>
<p>(Answer) Indeed, almost daily.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the general situation in the United States at present?</p>
<p>(Answer) Washington is very busy in general, with increased working hours for all kinds of jobs, and it is very intense every day. The strike situation has gradually subsided, and defense work is proceeding very smoothly.</p>
<p>(Question) What if you encounter Japanese aircraft on the way today?</p>
<p>(Answer) On the way, besides seeing beautiful clouds and a safe flight, there was nothing else to see.</p>
<p>After speaking, he laughed. After meeting with reporters, James went directly to the Executive Yuan to visit Vice President (Xiangxi) Kung.

<h3 id="e8">US Colonel Lindbergh - Writes to the President - Resigns from Air Force Reserve - After Being Called a "Copperhead" <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>New York - President Roosevelt recently referred to Colonel Lindbergh as a copperhead when meeting with reporters. Copperhead is the name of an American poisonous snake. During the American Civil War, this name was given to those who advocated appeasement. The President criticized Lindbergh as a copperhead because Lindbergh made anti-British remarks, saying that Britain had already failed. The President also said that because Lindbergh had different views on the international situation, the government did not call him into service. Lindbergh, therefore, recently wrote to the President, resigning from the US Air Force Reserve. He wrote, "The remarks made by the President on April 25 at the White House press conference, concerning my reserve position, greatly disturbed me. I had hoped that I could exercise my right as an American citizen to express my opinions publicly in peacetime without giving up my position in the Air Force Reserve during wartime. However, since Your Excellency, in your capacity as President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief of the Army, has clearly stated that I can no longer be used by the country, and has doubts about my loyalty and motives, I feel that there is no honorable way to resign from the position of Air Force Colonel. I take this action with great regret, as my relationship with the Air Force is one of the most important things in my life. However, I consider the civil right of my countrymen to freely discuss the current issues of war and peace to be even more important than this relationship. I will continue to serve the country to the best of my ability as a citizen." (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e9">America Prepares for War - Escort Operations Will Be Implemented Soon - Otherwise, the Lend-Lease Act Cannot Take Effect - Congressional Opposition Will Be Defeated <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Washington - War to escort Britain is being prepared. Prime Minister Churchill's broadcast speech is generally regarded as having changed the concept of "supplying us with war materials" to a call for "delivering war materials to us." At the same time, oil tycoon Rockefeller's advocacy of escort operations and former Ambassador to France Bullitt's warning that even at the risk of war, Britain should be given full support are all powerful voices in favor of escort operations. Pro-British committees across the country have also responded to this call and have formed a new organization called "Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies." Its founders are writers, journalists, lawyers, advertising agents, and celebrities. They plan to petition Congress to patrol the Atlantic with a fleet and escort food and war materials, as the Lend-Lease Act cannot take effect otherwise. The attitude of Congress will be revealed when the anti-escort bill is submitted to the Senate committee tomorrow. It is expected that the anti-escort bill will be defeated. Although the decision to defeat it is still passive, it can help create public opinion for escort operations. According to informed sources, escort operations will be implemented soon. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington - A congressional source said yesterday that it is heard that the United States' recent Atlantic northern neutrality patrol will extend to within five hundred miles of Britain. This source and other congressional sources reserved their criticism on whether this move would reduce the loss of dangerous ships. One source said that this is at most an incomplete method. The results of this patrol will seem to be reflected in the British Admiralty's ship loss reports. Some observers believe that if there is no significant reduction in ship losses, then only direct escort will do. Congressional sources said that they understand that US warships will patrol within the routes traveled by Allied ships. (29th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Both the Sino-Foreign Business News and the National News claim that the United States' adoption of a patrol system to clear the sea lanes so that ships carrying ... and military supplies can travel from the US to Britain is the first step for the United States to move towards true participation in the war. Both newspapers believe that this patrol system is indeed no different from escorting, and they anticipate that US warships will inevitably clash with the German and Italian navies, especially submarines. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>New York - The Force Protection Freedom Society stated that the number of supporters of the society's proposal that the United States fully join the total war is increasing daily. The letters and telegrams of support received include those from former Ambassador to Germany Gerard, Groton School Principal Dr. Peabody, Motion Picture Association Secretary Thompson, actress Ethel Barrymore, celebrity Melville, and Douglass, among others. Louis, a member of the society's national policy discussion, Douglass declared and advocated that the United States escort in the Atlantic immediately. (29th United Press Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e10">An Analysis of the European Struggle <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The Balkan war has ended. In the overall war situation, this does not have a final decisive effect; in Britain, it is not the final moment of victory or defeat; but we cannot therefore ignore the importance of this war. Obviously, as long as the Balkan war continues for one day, Germany and Italy will be forced to fight on two fronts, east and west; the flank of Italy will be under serious threat for one day; and the situation in the British Isles, the Mediterranean, the Atlantic, and Africa can be temporarily eased; so the failure of Britain in the Balkans has a very significant impact on future strategies. However, the Balkan war is not enough to judge the superiority or inferiority of the two sides. The three-week process and outcome only proved two things: first, the German-Italian joint land and air forces have an advantage in the corner of the Balkans, and second, Britain currently does not have the intention and preparation to concentrate its forces and immediately engage in a decisive battle with Germany and Italy. The contrast in the superior and inferior situation between the two sides on land and sea is an unshakeable fact, and of course, any competition in any aspect is subject to this basic situation. Germany and Italy were able to defeat the British and French allied forces on the Western Front last year, and of course, it is not difficult to defeat the Anglo-Greek forces in the Balkans now; but further, if Germany and Italy cannot find a land route and rashly expand the war in Africa, or disregard everything and provoke a major Mediterranean war and attack the British Isles now, then their fate of惨败 is of course destined long ago, needless to say.</p>
<p>In such a land and sea confrontation situation, the British Navy now almost completely controls all the sea surfaces surrounding Europe and Africa, and the only areas that can be further controlled by it are the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, and the Adriatic Sea. On the other hand, the German and Italian armies in continental Europe have now reached their highest peak of glory. If they do not rush into Soviet Ukraine and Turkey, then the only targets for their power to be exerted are the Iberian Peninsula's Spain and Portugal. Moreover, even in these land and sea areas, any possible developments and advances and retreats in the present and near future still cannot determine the success or failure of the two sides. Therefore, a stalemate will soon appear between the land and sea main forces of the two sides, and the final showdown will not be held immediately; but of course, air combat and the competition for military equipment will be intensified many times more than before. The recent major air raids by Britain and Germany against each other, as well as the British Prime Minister's emphasis on US air machinery supply, are meaningful in this.</p>
<p>Of course, stalemate does not mean stagnation. Although Britain and Germany cannot fight a decisive battle with each other for a while, they will certainly accelerate the expansion of their respective land and sea military equipment in preparation for the date of that great decisive battle; and at the same time, Britain, with its overwhelming naval superiority, can probably engage in the following tasks: (1) intensifying the blockade of continental Europe, attempting to gradually paralyze the German and Italian war mechanisms under the pressure of shortages of important raw materials and food, (2) ensuring its own maritime transport lines, so that the resources of all its colonies can be continuously organized and incorporated into its war mechanisms, especially important is to ensure the safety of maritime transport with the United States in the Atlantic. As for the German and Italian side, it is also bound to make full use of all its advantages to carry out: (1) slowly sneaking into Africa or the Near East with the army, attempting to gradually disintegrate the British Empire from the land, (2) taking advantage of the current slight superiority of the air force and submarines, desperately hammering British maritime shipping, (3) using all means to destroy the arrival of US supplies to the British Isles.</p>
<p>Although the success or failure of the two sides must be left to the overall results of the actual struggle in the future to answer, there is no need to predict now. But it is worth pointing out the importance of the role played by the United States and the Soviet Union in this great struggle. Leaving aside the role of American aid to Britain in the past, from now on, its role will of course become more and more important day by day, and it can even be said to hold the key to Britain's overall victory or defeat. In terms of materials, the United States is almost stronger than the sum of Germany and Italy. In terms of population, it is also roughly equivalent to the total number of Germany and Italy, even if limited to non-participation in the war, its 17 million enlistment-age youths can also be used as volunteers and in various other ways to join the British army to remedy one of Britain's greatest weaknesses against Germany and Italy. And in the current struggle between Britain and Germany for control of the Atlantic, the United States is in a very important position. Recently, all parties in the United States have clearly stated that the United States' contribution to Britain is not limited to manufacturing war equipment, but will also take responsibility for ensuring that it can safely reach the British Isles. With close cooperation between the British and American navies, the possibility of Germany and Italy succeeding in destroying their maritime transport in the Atlantic is very small. Looking at the relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany and Italy, even if we put aside all future political developments, the mere economic and material cooperation has already made the British put unlimited hope in the decisive effect of the blockade against Germany and Italy, which has become a pie in the sky, assuming that this situation continues, then the date when Germany and Italy feel fatal pressure is very distant.</p>
<p>In short, although both Britain and Germany are intensifying their efforts to cultivate their own strength and search for the weaknesses of the other side in order to make a final strike; but if the attitudes of the United States and the Soviet Union remain unchanged for a long time, then before the great reckoning, the whole world is probably destined to suffer prolonged pain and struggle.</p>

Each city will convene public assemblies where prominent figures will discuss the history and customs of Nice. General Garibaldi's ancestors were one of the three heroes of Italian unification. (29th Haitong News Agency) Dr. Védrine's Miraculous Medical Skills - The renowned French neurologist, Dr. Védrine, has recently arrived in Shanghai and is residing at the Hua Mao Hotel on the Bund, where he is practicing medicine and restoring health. His miraculous skills are widely praised, creating a sensation throughout Shanghai. Dr. Védrine is the inventor of a new therapy, truly a revolutionary pioneer in medicine. He treats patients without the aid of drugs; instead, by simply contacting the end of the sympathetic nervous system within the nasal mucus, he can cure diseases. This is because this major nerve controls the functions of all our organs. When this nerve is in good condition, we are healthy; when it is not, we are ill; when it ceases to function, we die. - Dr. Védrine uses extremely simple medical instruments, only a few small metal rods. During diagnosis and treatment, he first asks the patient to sit before him, uses a light to examine the nostrils, and touches various points inside the nose with the small rods. The patient experiences no pain, only slight moisture in the eyes and a slightly red face, sometimes sneezing, which indicates a good response to the treatment. This novel medical technique achieves astonishing results, especially for chronic illnesses that were previously considered incurable, such as asthma, chronic rheumatism, and epilepsy, all of which can be miraculously cured. - Asthma is the condition most frequently and effectively treated by Dr. Védrine. Patients often experience immediate relief or significant reduction in breathing difficulties after his treatment. According to statistics Dr. Védrine gathered during his practice in Paris, 80 out of every 100 patients were either cured or had their suffering greatly reduced. Other ailments, such as asthmatic cough, chronic nasal catarrh, and hay fever, can also be cured by this new therapy. - Furthermore, Dr. Védrine's miraculous skills are effective for various neurological disorders. New and old headaches disappear after a few treatments. Insomnia and nightmares are resolved with diagnosis and treatment, leading to restful sleep. Fainting, tremors, and palpitations can all be cured. Even nervous weakness can be treated to restore peace of mind, confidence, and normalcy. Dr. Védrine declares, "Over the past ten years, I have treated thousands of patients with a wide range of complex ailments. Generally, patients tend to exaggerate their conditions, distrusting others and themselves, causing them to laugh or get angry for no reason. They often experience headaches, stomach aches, indigestion, insomnia, and even fear riding in cars or crossing the street. Some are prone to panic attacks, confusion, and depression. All these conditions are caused by weakness and dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous system, which my technique can restore to normalcy within days." Dr. Védrine is also capable of correcting physical weakness and mental retardation in children. Therefore, laziness in children is a symptom of illness and should be treated early rather than scolded. - The new "nasal membrane contact" therapy can also alleviate pain, such as rheumatic bone pain, back pain, and nerve pain inside and out. - It is also remarkably effective for treating indigestion. Patients suffering from stomach pain or drowsiness after meals often endure strict diets, which they find distressing. After Dr. Védrine's treatment, they can eat normally without suffering. - Problems with blood circulation, such as high blood pressure and menstrual issues, can also be resolved after a few treatments. Moreover, Dr. Védrine's miraculous skills have achieved astonishing results in treating paralysis, especially hemiplegia and Parkinson's disease. Patients with Parkinson's disease suffer from stiff bodies, slow movements, and tremors. These conditions are often considered incurable by other physicians but can be improved with Dr. Védrine's "nasal membrane contact" technique, thereby improving their health. As for premature aging and sexually transmitted diseases, this technique is remarkably effective, with the potential to rejuvenate the body. - Epilepsy is also considered an incurable disease, but Dr. Védrine has cured many people in recent months. After treatment, patients experience reduced seizures, gradually decreasing the frequency of epileptic episodes until they disappear completely. - In conclusion, the "nasal membrane contact" therapy is powerful, treating a wide range of ailments, and providing hope for those suffering from previously incurable conditions. With Dr. Védrine's treatment, they can turn danger into safety, grief into joy, and transform disappointment and despair into a life of happiness and self-assurance, enjoying the pleasures of life. - However, Dr. Védrine takes a cautious approach and does not proceed with treatment recklessly. He first examines the patient to assess the reactivity of their nervous system before deciding on a course of action. Those treated by Dr. Védrine can be assured of complete or significant relief, as he understands the importance of thorough preparation and successful completion. - Dr. Védrine is a scientific expert, a graduate of the University of Paris School of Medicine, and has served as a physician in major hospitals. His renowned new technique is based on scientific principles, allowing patients to feel secure and comfortable under his care. Since arriving in Shanghai, he has enabled countless disappointed and despairing individuals to regain their original state and thrive once more. - Patients wishing to seek treatment from Dr. Védrine can visit Room 707 at the Hua Mao Hotel on the Bund between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM or 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM daily (excluding Saturday afternoons and Sundays). - Dr. Védrine will deliver a lecture in English on asthma and respiratory diseases on Friday at 8:05 PM on the Great American Evening Post Radio Station (XMHC, 700 kHz), which is expected to draw a large audience interested in his medical insights. <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>

<p>US-UK-Dutch Cooperation to Protect Shipping Routes - More US Bombers Arrive in the Philippines - Plans to Utilize Dutch East Indies Submarines - Manila - Eight U.S. aviators and four light bombers assigned to the U.S. Army in the Philippines have arrived aboard the cruiser "Mariana." These bombers have been assigned to the first detachment of new aircraft, and it is rumored that even more will arrive within the next three months. According to reliable sources, several long-range patrol bombers have been deployed to Singapore via Manila, Guam and the Dutch East Indies, Canton Island, New Caledonia, Australia, and the Dutch East Indies. The Navy has refused to disclose the number of aircraft that have arrived in Singapore, but has said that the number has doubled, since three Consolidated bombers arrived in Singapore last week. These bombers will be used by British and Dutch authorities to patrol the South Pacific and Indian Oceans, protecting against Axis raids, as it is widely believed that the Axis powers will soon launch a new attack in this vast area. Authorities also state that many German ships have been used for this attack, some of which are currently docked in Japanese ports, while others are said to have been hidden in Japanese-mandated islands since November and December of last year. It is also believed that this Axis attack will coincide with the African war. With the United States expanding its patrol range around the Philippines and the British and Dutch authorities acquiring long-range patrol aircraft, naval officials believe that these three countries are cooperating to protect new shipping routes from Asia to the Red Sea and defend against German raiding ships, thus securing the passage of U.S. vessels. However, it is not yet known whether U.S. supply ships are currently using this route. The recent arrival in Manila of two U.S. military equipment experts is indicative of U.S., British, and Dutch cooperation. These two experts had previously spent three months in the Dutch East Indies planning military equipment matters, with a particular focus on submarine issues, as both the U.S. and the Dutch have strong submarine forces in the Far East. It is also reported that these two experts have instructed Dutch East Indies merchant seamen on how to use magnetic mine defense equipment, as several magnetic mines have been discovered in the South Pacific. It is believed that these mines were dropped by German aircraft.

When reporters asked for comparative figures, Pownall smiled and did not answer, only saying that two years ago there were only garrisons defending Singapore, but now garrisons are spread throughout the Malay Peninsula. "We no longer only think of defending Singapore," he said. When asked about the continuing arrival of reinforcements, he said that it is well known that there are a large number of fresh troops available and that virtually every ship brings new troops. When asked about U.S. assistance, he replied that U.S. planes, machine guns, and transport vehicles have been received, but no other military supplies. The Malayan Air Force has been greatly strengthened and is essential to defense because any invading force must rely on nearby bases to launch air strikes.

Multiple incendiary bombs were dropped within the first fifteen minutes, followed by oil bombs and high explosives. Anti-aircraft fire was intense. The air raid lasted for several hours. Although the situation was quite intense, there have been no reports of casualties so far. It is believed that two German planes were shot down. It is reported that a city on the south coast was also attacked.

(29th United Press Dispatch) Random Notes on the European War (49) The Hardships and Joys of Desert Warfare - The battlefields of North and East Africa are approximately the size of the European continent. The British army currently operates in at least four areas: Libya, Eritrea, Abyssinia, and Somaliland. Because of their differing longitudes and latitudes, each area has a different climate. For example, Libya is extremely cold, while Somaliland is scorching. Therefore, the equipment brought by the British forces reinforcing the Mediterranean coast is entirely unsuitable. This is true not only for the infantry, but also for the mechanized units and transport corps, which are significantly affected by the terrain. Vehicles suitable for use in Libya are not suitable for the rugged terrain of Abyssinia. In such places, the only way to transport supplies is by using camels or mules. - Libya is unbearably cold, with temperatures often below freezing. The southeasterly winds blowing from the desert plateau are as scorching as a furnace in the summer, but piercingly cold in the winter. - It is extremely difficult to fire a gun at any time in the desert. Rifles and machine gun barrels are often filled with sand. The Arabs are accustomed to wrapping the gun barrels in rags and plugging the muzzles to prevent sand from entering. However, if ambushed by enemy reconnaissance teams while marching, they would be caught off guard and suffer at their hands. - In addition, there is no shelter in the cold desert nights except for the cisterns dug out of gray stone in ancient Roman times. During the day, the wind whips up sand and hundreds of vehicles drive through the sandstorms, making it impossible to distinguish directions within a few feet, as if one were in a dense forest. After walking only a few hundred yards, the eyes, nostrils, and throat are filled with sand, causing suffocation. - Desert warfare is also different from land warfare, with only naval warfare being comparable. In naval battles, the location of the battle is irrelevant, and even crossing borders is not a major concern. As long as the enemy ship is defeated, it does not matter how far they advance. The only strategy in desert warfare is to inflict heavy damage on the enemy forces, causing the greatest possible loss of manpower and resources, with the ultimate goal of exhausting and defeating the enemy. - There is far less to say about desert warfare than about warfare on fertile land. Soldiers fighting in the desert must endure every kind of suffering that humans can encounter and have only emotional or aesthetic consolation. - Despite its many difficulties, desert warfare also has its fascinating aspects. Many of the greatest contributions to the history of human struggle have come from warriors who have undergone rigorous training in the desert. - The beauty and abhorrence of the desert are unparalleled. A reporter who has inspected the desert regions of western Egypt, where General Wavell's troops of the British Middle East Command are operating, feels that although it is desolate, the beautiful scenery gives one the feeling that living there for the rest of one's life would be infinitely enjoyable. However, upon revisiting the same place a few hours later, it feels no different than a wasteland of rubble, with dark, stunted trees resembling stone cats crouching and waiting to be fed. - The above recollections are not entirely without purpose; they can explain why even the most insensitive person in the desert will complain about the discomfort they suffer, but is unwilling to be transferred to fight elsewhere, because desert warfare relies on a passion, a fighting spirit that is sometimes unseen in other theaters of war. Of course, desert warfare is often nothing more than a solace for boredom and loneliness, but sometimes desert life makes people feel small, thus making their innate abilities more acute. - Even the desert traversed by the British forces along the Nile is not as grand as the Arabian Desert, but the hardships it imposes on humans are no different. Extreme heat, extreme cold—although the temperature in the sandy oases rarely drops below forty degrees, it often feels like forty degrees below freezing—lack of drinking water, lack of shade, and the scorching sun and torrential rains are extremely dangerous for those who do not take care of themselves. - The most dangerous thing in the desert is the wind. When the "Khamsin" wind blows from the equatorial region, carrying sand, the air is filled with a thick orange haze, making it impossible to see beyond fifteen feet. At this time, only by wearing a mask can one breathe air that is not contaminated with dust. - The wind is so strong that it can blow military vehicles off course as easily as it knocks down tents. However, it is a great messenger of peace; as soon as the wind rises, the fighting between the two armies will immediately stop, and at this time people think only of avoiding suffocation. - At this time, the temperature rises sharply, the terrestrial landscape gradually disappears, dust and sand obscure the sky, and the raging waves of the Mediterranean Sea strike the cliffs and coasts like cannons, forcing even naval warfare to stop. - Although the Khamsin comes suddenly, it also goes quickly. In an instant, the yellow haze that covers the sky returns to the earth, and the battle resumes. - In the winter, the surface of the desert is sometimes frozen, and the north wind howls, blowing along the dry riverbeds, past the tops of cliffs and precipices, and striking the face like a knife. These are the two major disasters of the desert. Although human ingenuity has overcome countless difficulties, it has so far been unable to cope with these two.

The number of people from all walks of life who went to the Lone Army Camp yesterday to pay their respects to his remains and attend the ceremony was even more crowded, with people lining up to enter and exit continuously for as long as five hours, totaling more than 60,000 people. The tragic situation was unprecedented, demonstrating the indomitable spirit of the Chinese nation. The details are as follows: - 60,000 Mourners in an Endless Line - Starting early yesterday morning, crowds surged along Singapore Road, coming from all directions. From Xiaoshadu Road to the front of the Lone Army Camp, a line of people stretched for dozens of zhang, mostly students, workers, and office staff, with a very large number. The mourners held banners and floral tributes high in the air. To maintain order, the police authorities completely sealed off Jiaozhou Road Changping Road, Jiaozhou Road Singapore Road, and the western side of Singapore Road near the Lone Army Camp with iron nets, opening only Singapore Road for the public to enter and exit, with more than a dozen police officers stationed along the road. The crowds entered the camp hall to pay their respects to the remains. Because the number of people was over 60,000, entry and exit were difficult. The bamboo fence of the Shanghai Municipal Council Primary School next to the Lone Army Camp was dismantled to create an open path as an exit. - The Camp Inside and Out Was a Sea of White - Yesterday, the Lone Army Camp received a large number of elegiac couplets and banners from all walks of life, which were hung all over the inside and outside of the camp, creating a white, solemn atmosphere. Wreaths and flowers were piled up like mountains. Above the hall hung a painted oil portrait of General Xie in military uniform, donated by Ms. Yang Huimin (who sent the national flag to the Sihang Warehouse during the August 13th War), nearly a zhang in size, imposing respect. Yesterday, due to the excessive number of people and the limited size of the hall, many visitors left the camp after paying their respects to the remains, leaving only about 10,000 people to attend the coffin-closing ceremony, which was originally scheduled for 11:00 AM but was delayed until 12:00 PM due to the overwhelming number of people paying their respects. - The Coffin-Closing Ceremony Was Solemn and Tragic - At around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, Regimental Commander Shangguan Zhibiao, who was injured while pursuing the murderer and was recuperating in the hospital, was assisted back to the camp to pay his respects. He cried bitterly before General Xie's coffin and then bid farewell and returned to the hospital. When the coffin-closing ceremony began, all the Lone Army soldiers and guests gathered in the hall. After everyone stood in silence, the band played mournful music, and the presiding officer, Regimental Commander Lei, took his place, sang the national anthem, and bowed three times to the Party and national flag and General Xie's portrait. After a three-minute silence, flowers and fruits were offered, followed by a viewing of the remains. All the Lone Army soldiers and guests circled the coffin in turn. At this time, mournful music was played again, the tone of which was mournful. Many people, whether they knew him or not, wept bitterly. Amid this sea of crying, the coffin was closed, and many of General Xie's friends prostrated themselves before the coffin, unable to rise, and some wept loudly on the coffin. The scene was extremely tragic. The ceremony ended at 2:00 PM. General Xie's coffin will remain temporarily in the hall, covered with the national flag, until preparations are complete and the burial site is selected. - The Memorial Service Will Limit the Number of Attendees - The Lone Army Camp is scheduled to hold a memorial service for Regimental Commander Xie on May 3rd. The funeral committee, in order to maintain order, has decided to limit the number of attendees, stipulating that each organization can send four representatives to participate. A registration office has been established, and organizations can go to the camp starting immediately to obtain admission passes. News reporters will be issued separate press passes. The memorial service will be held at 11:00 AM that morning. In the afternoon, there will be a group memorial service by various organizations, with no limit on the number of attendees. Several memorial songs for Regimental Commander Xie have been received, and it has now been decided to adopt one composed by a certain gentleman. A music instructor is currently training soldiers in the camp to sing it on the 3rd. - Western Newspapers Comment with Admiration - The "Continental Daily News" commented that when the body of Xie Jinyuan, the Lone Army Commander who was murdered last week by four rebel soldiers, was laid to rest, nearly 20,000 Chinese people went to pay their respects, demonstrating the admiration for him. Chairman Chiang has ordered the remittance of 50,000 yuan to provide for General Xie's family, and General Xie's children will be educated by the government, demonstrating the government's generous treatment. Why is this? In late October 1937, when Chinese troops were withdrawing from the west, General Xie led the Lone Army in a final, strong resistance in the Sihang Warehouse. General Xie had intended to sacrifice himself for his country, but the authorities in the International Settlement requested Chairman Chiang to consider the safety of the settlement and ordered General Xie to lead his troops to withdraw. General Xie obeyed the order and reluctantly entered the International Settlement from the Sihang Warehouse. His subordinates were trapped in the Lone Army Camp on Singapore Road. Now, General Xie has been killed by rebel soldiers, ending the life of this outstanding hero of the Sino-Japanese War. It is a tragedy. However, it is important to emphasize that the heroic deeds of the Lone Army are enough to inspire the spirit of the Chinese nation and arouse the feelings of foreigners, and can serve as a model of the Chinese spirit of sacrifice. - Our Readers Contribute from Their Salaries to Express Condolences - The workers of a certain iron factory, readers of this newspaper, contributed 97 yuan from one day's wages yesterday and sent it to this newspaper to be forwarded to the Lone Army Camp as condolences. Their original letter stated: "To the esteemed Editor, we were shocked and saddened to read the report that Regimental Commander Xie was assassinated and suddenly passed away. We deeply mourn his loss. We, the undersigned, remember the bravery of the Regimental Commander in defending the Sihang Warehouse in those difficult years, which was a model for our country's soldiers. Now, to be harmed by his subordinates, we are very angry and saddened. We have contributed one day's wages, totaling 97 yuan and 5 jiao, and send it to your newspaper, hoping that you will forward it on our behalf. Although the amount is small, it is a small token of our deep respect." Coal Prices Rise Again - Yesterday, after the coal market opened, the market situation was quite tight, and major hoarders still insisted on hoarding large quantities, waiting for high prices to sell. As a result, the black market continued to rise, and the highest grade of Deli white coal was quoted at 444 yuan per ton, reaching a peak. The black market price of coal briquettes also continued to rise, once quoted at 310 yuan per ton. However, major coal briquette companies still maintained the original price of 296 yuan, and the retail price was 16 yuan per dan (100 market catties). Charity Shelter for the Poor Will Close Today - The Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association, which established a shelter for the poor last winter in Yanjiazhai, Difeng Road, Hongqiao, has been operating for nearly five months. It was originally scheduled to close at the end of last month, but due to the uncertain climate in the city, it was extended for one month. It will be closed at the end of this month (today). The poor people who are generally housed will be given some funds and dismissed to seek their own livelihoods. May Day Tomorrow - All Workers in the City Celebrate - Joint Defense of the Two Settlements Begins Simultaneously in May - Tomorrow is International Labor Day. Workers in all industries in the city have decided to take a day off to celebrate this great, glorious, and sacred festival, as per tradition. Due to the limitations of the environment, no rallies will be held. With unwavering, solemn, and enthusiastic emotions and intentions, they will support resistance and construction, and be loyal to the Party and the country. They have decided to jointly send a telegram to Chairman Chiang to pay their respects and to comfort the front lines. All factories will be closed for one day, as per tradition, and all wages will be paid to show cooperation between labor and capital. All major Chinese and foreign newspapers in the city will also take a day off. Joint Defense of the Settlements Begins Tomorrow Morning - The police authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession, because tomorrow is the first day of the May Revolution and also International Labor Day, and workers in all industries will take a day off as per tradition, and because there are many labor strikes in Shanghai and rumors that unscrupulous elements will take advantage of this day to commit excesses in the settlement areas, have decided to begin "May Joint Defense" at 5:00 AM tomorrow. The two settlements will take simultaneous steps to prevent illegal activities, dispatching all police personnel, national defense forces, and the International Settlement Volunteer Corps to carry out necessary preventive work during the commemorative festival (including blocking roads, alleys, and bridges, searching pedestrians and vehicles, and public places). Tomorrow morning at 5:00 AM, some unnecessary roads will be blocked, and barbed wire obstacles will be added, until midnight of the same day, and the measures will continue on the dawn of the 3rd (because the 3rd is the anniversary of the Jinan Massacre). On the other hand, during this month, (1) the curfew law will be strictly enforced (between 12:30 AM and 5:00 AM, no one is allowed to walk on the road without a curfew pass, and violators will be detained at the police station), (2) no organization is allowed to hold meetings, form associations, parade, or demonstrate without the permission of the settlement authorities, and (3) undercover police will be stationed in all public places to monitor. Tuberculosis Prevention Campaign Scheduled to End Today - The second tuberculosis prevention campaign in the city, which began on the 16th of this month, with the cooperation of 18 hospitals including Hongqiao and China-Belgium, is holding free X-ray examinations for half a month, and has also obtained the support of the city's Western medicine industry, setting preferential measures to benefit patients. This measure is to eradicate the great enemy of human diseases, improve the health of citizens, and benefit the public. It is reported that since the campaign began, many citizens have been going to hospitals in the city every day to register for examinations. However, because each hospital limits the number of examinations each day, many people are unable to get them. Today is the last day of the free X-ray examinations. A reporter from Pingming News visited the person in charge of the Tuberculosis Prevention Association yesterday and learned that this tuberculosis prevention campaign has been held with the assistance of major hospitals and pharmacies in the city, and the results are commendable. The exact statistics on the number of people who have participated in the examination in the past fourteen days and the tuberculosis situation are not yet available, but according to the reports of various hospitals, it is estimated that about 8,000 people have participated in the examination, of which 30% are confirmed to have tuberculosis, half of whom have severe symptoms. If they can be properly treated, there is hope for recovery. As for those whose conditions are too severe and there is no possibility of medical recovery, they account for about one-fifth of the total. The person in charge added that this expanded tuberculosis prevention campaign has not yet aroused the attention of all citizens. It is hoped that all sectors can do their best to promote it when the third campaign begins next year. Maiden Voyage of the USS President Hayes - The U.S. President Lines Company's six newly built world-class mail ships, the Jackson and Monroe, have already set sail, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the third new mail ship, the President Hayes, has also been completed. At the beginning of last month, the maiden voyage was to the east, departing from Boston, via New York, Havana, Cristobal, Balboa, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Honolulu, and to Kobe, Japan, and is scheduled to arrive in port today at 3:30 PM, berthing at buoys 11 and 12. Passengers will be transferred to the company's prepared small launches and land at the New Customs Wharf at about 4:30 PM today. The new ship will stay in Shanghai overnight and set sail tomorrow at 11:30 AM (i.e., the evening of May 1st) to Hong Kong, Little Luzon, via Singapore, Penang, Colombo, Bombay, Cape Town, Trinidad, and return to New York and Boston, following the original planned global voyage. Due to the outbreak of the European war and the closure of the Suez Canal, it will return to the United States via Bombay. The launch for passengers will depart from the New Customs Wharf at 10:00 PM tomorrow night. The new mail ships have the same tonnage and style, with only first-class cabins and a total of 77 passengers, of which 24 will disembark in Shanghai and 53 will continue on to Nanyang and around the world. The company originally planned to invite all sectors to visit the new ship, but due to these extraordinary times, it has cancelled the visit, as it did with the previous two new ships. Sentinel Shot by Gunfire - Seriously Injured - The English "Great American Evening Post" reported that the Japanese authorities are investigating a case in which a Japanese Marine Corps sentry was shot at around 8:20 PM last night (28th) at the New Gate Bridge. At the time, the sentry was on duty near the bridgehead when a lone assailant approached and fired several shots. The Japanese sentry was shot in the upper abdomen and injured. The assailant is believed to have fled into the Public Concession. Moments later, a large number of Japanese military police rushed to the scene, cordoned off the area around the incident, and, together with the Marine Corps soldiers patrolling the New Gate area, closed off the bridges and conducted a thorough search, but did not capture the assailant. The "North China Daily News" also reported that the Japanese sentry was shot six times by the assailant, with at least one bullet hitting him in the abdomen. He staggered for a few steps, intending to take refuge in the guardhouse, but collapsed after only a few steps. He was then taken to a Japanese hospital, where he is in serious condition. Coffin-Closing Ceremony for Commander Xie - The coffin-closing ceremony for Commander Xie Jinyuan was held at noon yesterday. 60,000 mourners lined up for dozens of zhang (top picture) is the scene of mourners entering the camp and walking into the hall (bottom picture) many of the onlookers cried bitterly during the coffin-closing ceremony. The picture shows one moment during the coffin closing. (Kang Zuyi Photography) Rice Prices Soar Daily - The Seriousness Reaches Its Peak - If Not Stopped, It Will Shake People's Hearts - Can the City's Safety Be Allowed to Be Ignored? - Since the authorities ordered the removal of price limits on domestic and foreign rice, there are no restrictions on the buying and selling of rice in the rice market. Rice merchants can freely set prices when releasing rice, resulting in domestic and foreign rice prices continuing to rise, and the market situation is chaotic and the public is nervous, which can be described as unprecedented. The authorities' removal of price limits has failed to achieve the original intention of regulating food supply. After the rice market opened yesterday, the market situation became increasingly chaotic. - Rice prices were raised higher and higher by rice brokers, and rice shops hoarded goods, resulting in a shortage of spot goods in the market. At the beginning of the market, high-grade tribute rice was fiercely raised by 150 yuan per shi, reaching a peak, and second-grade goods were also priced as high as 145-6 yuan per shi. Later, due to a slight reduction in demand, high-grade goods fell back by two yuan. However, this rapid advance in rice prices was purely due to rice brokers' manipulation. Brokers also resumed their intermediary role yesterday. In addition, - Thailand Shipping - The first trial voyage of the Shanghai-bound Xisheng Tong, belonging to the company, carried 40,000 bags of Thai rice to Shanghai. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 27th, but due to severe weather encountered during the voyage, the journey was delayed. It is now learned that the ship is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on Thursday morning and berth at the Longmao Foreign Firm's Pudong Wharf, where it will berth until the next morning before unloading. According to the company's news, Thai ships will henceforth be dedicated to sailing between Shanghai and Bangkok, Thailand, mainly transporting rice. Its sister ship, Xilica, will follow in mid-May, carrying a large amount of rice. U.S. Chamber of Commerce - Entertains Business Corps Members - More Than 400 Participants - The "North China Daily News" reported that the Shanghai U.S. Chamber of Commerce held a banquet at the U.S. General Assembly on Friday evening to entertain the U.S. team of the Shanghai International Settlement Volunteer Corps, and specially screened war films to entertain the guests. More than 400 people, including members of the U.S. business corps and guests, attended the banquet. Chamber of Commerce Acting President Nichols delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the directors and members, first apologizing for the limited space and inability to entertain all members of the business corps, and then praising the members of the business corps for serving the community and maintaining the security of the Public Concession, and thanking them on behalf of U.S. businessmen and all U.S. citizens. Business Strike - Talks Will Resume Today - Regarding the business strike, Ms. Xingde of the Industrial Section and Mr. Lu Gaoyi convened a formal conversation with the labor representatives at the Municipal Council the day before yesterday.

<h3 id="e18">Thai Soldiers Fight, Relying on Divine Protection; Soldiers Wear Red Clothes, Said to be Bulletproof <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Bangkok: According to investigations by this reporter, Buddhism played a very important role in the Thai-Vietnamese War, which recently concluded with a conference in Tokyo. Many Thai soldiers believe they will not be killed by the enemy because they have divine protection to defend against enemy guns and cannons. During the war, Buddhist monks were very busy manufacturing so-called "red clothes." It is said that wearing the "red clothes" makes one bulletproof. These red clothes all have Buddha images on them and, after being made, are prayed over by monks in a special ceremony. It is said that the Bangkok infantry battalion, which occupied Champasak and participated in the first un-and war, had these clothes as protective amulets. It is also said that because they had this treasure, the number of deaths and injuries was almost non-existent. Soldiers returning from the front admit that some soldiers wearing these red clothes were injured, but they believe that this was only because the French bullets were too tightly compressed and did not penetrate the red clothes. However, it has also been heard that many soldiers were killed by French machine-gun fire. Many Thai doctors who returned to Bangkok after being at the front for some time expressed doubts about this divine art. After the ceasefire, according to news reported here, a Japanese officer dispatched from a Japanese warship stationed here conducted experiments on these talismanic clothes. A Thai soldier wearing red clothes allowed him to experiment on him. The Japanese man fired a pistol at the Thai soldier from a very short distance. However, when the gun was fired, the bullet jammed in the gun and could not come out. So the Japanese officer pointed the gun at the sky and fired, and with a bang, the bullet left the gun and soared into the sky. However, some people say that when the Japanese officer was about to shoot the Thai soldier in red clothes, he had already put the safety on the gun, and later he took off the safety and fired it into the sky. It is also heard that Thai soldiers who could not get the red clothes would nail a Buddha image on their clothes to avoid disasters. It is said that this kind of Buddha image has been used by Thai soldiers and civilians for more than a hundred years, and most of the ones used by soldiers now are from a hundred years ago, and were unearthed from the ancient ruins of Ayutthaya. Therefore, during the recent Thai-Vietnamese War, many of the protective items worn by Thai soldiers may have been taken from the necks of Thai soldiers who resisted the Burmese troops who destroyed the capital Ayutthaya in 1767. Even the supreme Thai commander recognizes that the "Three Jewels" of Buddhism have great power. The so-called "Three Jewels" are "Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha," that is, the trinity of Buddhism. In the recent Thai-Vietnamese War, the final words of each communique issued by the Supreme Command of Thailand were "By the power of the Three Jewels, there will be no casualties among the Thai army."

<h3 id="e19">County Councilors and Township Representatives: Examination Committee Begins Selection; Expected to Need to Select Approximately Five Million Candidates; Examination Method Divided into Two Types: Examination and Review <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Examination Yuan's Examination and Selection Committee has begun conducting the review of candidates for county councilors and township representatives, as previously reported. This reporter believes that this matter is still an innovation in the history of China's examination system. In order to understand the significance and methods of implementing the examination of candidates for county councilors and township representatives, a special visit was made to the person in charge of the Examination Committee to inquire about various matters. I received a detailed reply, which can be summarized as follows: The system of examination for candidates for public office was originally created by the Founding Father. Following the will of the Founding Father, it is clear that administering examinations to candidates for public office not only does not restrict the right of citizens to be elected, but also compensates for the shortcomings of the election system and promotes the spirit of true equality. It is a prerequisite for promoting democracy. The laws and regulations for the election of county councilors are being actively discussed by the legislative body and will soon be promulgated and implemented. Provinces under the new county system that are still seeking to establish local public opinion organs are waiting to plan and establish them. County councilors and township representatives are representatives of the people. The significance of requiring these candidates to pass examinations and obtain qualifications is, of course, as important as mentioned above. Considering that the country is vast and the number of county councilors and township representatives is large, the government has set particularly lenient qualifications and simplified procedures in order to give the general public an opportunity to participate in government. It is expected that approximately five million candidates will need to be examined. The Examination Committee is determined to complete this public office candidate examination system with its greatest efforts. The examination method is divided into two types: examination and review. The examination is not limited to examinations, and the review is not a procedure prior to the examination. The two run in parallel, with different approaches but the same goal. According to regulations, examinations are conducted in writing and can be entrusted to the provincial governments. Recently, Guangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Hubei, Henan, and other provinces have successively sent telegrams to discuss examination methods, and examinations will soon be held. For the review, it is only necessary to review qualification documents, and tests or oral examinations will be conducted if necessary. If the review is passed, the candidate can obtain the qualifications for that position and does not need to take the examination again. During the election, they can be elected as county councilors or township representatives. The review is handled by the Qualification Review Committee and has long been approved to begin. Letters from all parties requesting to obtain the application review guidelines and forms have been very enthusiastic and have been sent out separately. Those who aspire to be county councilors or township representatives but have not yet obtained the forms can still write directly to the Chongqing Examination and Selection Committee to obtain them, or go to the local county government or designated district office or township office to obtain samples and copy them in the same format. They can apply for review at any time. (29th Dispatch)</p>

<p>London: According to the latest news received here this afternoon, the enemy forces attacking Egypt across the border have now been halted by severe sandstorms. It is reported that in some places, it is impossible to see beyond fifty yards, and the situation is likely to worsen. People in Cairo generally say that these sandstorms are extremely beneficial to the British army, as the British army currently has far more experience in desert warfare than the German and Italian armies. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Cairo: The fall of Sollum was acknowledged yesterday by the British side here. The battle for Alexandria and the Suez Canal appears to be about to unfold with full force. The main objective of the Axis forces in occupying Sollum is to advance to Musa Mandra, which is 130 miles east of Sollum and the starting point of the railway to Alexandria and the Suez Canal. According to military sources here, two columns of Axis armored forces used a large encirclement maneuver to break through Sollum and defeat its defenders. It is reported that the British Air Force in the Middle East has stepped up its bombing and strafing of Axis warships, aircraft, and troop transports carrying troops to land in Panina. According to official reports, one troop transport suffered heavy casualties, and other ships were severely damaged. The British occupation of the stage suggests that the resistance of the Italian army in East Africa will collapse. People here do not deny the serious situation of defending the Suez Canal, and if the Axis powers occupy the canal, it will be a major blow to the European war. However, it is said that the military situation is not necessarily more serious than what the British army has already experienced. The battle of Egypt will be beneficial to the British army and the imperial army. (29th International Dispatch)</p>
<p>Cairo: The British headquarters issued a public statement this afternoon: (1) The British army in Greece continues to retreat. (2) No important events to report in Tobruk. (3) Since crossing the border, the enemy forces in Sollum have been stalled and are often harassed by British reconnaissance teams. (4) In Abyssinia, the British army is making satisfactory progress on all fronts. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Cairo: Responsible officials in Cairo stated that after the enemy forces crossed the Egyptian border from Libya at the end of the week, the border outpost of Sollum is thought to have fallen into enemy hands. Military sources in Cairo are very pleased with the capture of Taiz in northern Abyssinia. Taiz is located at the intersection of the roads leading from Addis Ababa and northwest to Gondar. Gondar is still being held by Italian forces, and the road from there leads northeast to the port of Asab on the Red Sea. Taiz fell to the British army after the Italian troops stationed there were defeated at the Kampo Erchia Pass, fourteen miles south of the city. Part of the Italian garrison may have retreated to Gondar, north of Lake Tana. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e23">Southern Border of French Somaliland: Rumors of Tegore's Troops Concentrating <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Vichy: According to a dispatch from the port of Djibouti in French East Africa, Tegore's troops, covered by British motorized units, have indeed concentrated near the southern border of French Somaliland, with their main force gathered near the town of Dao'an and the town of Chailah in British Somaliland, near the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway. These troops are preparing to contact the French border guards in Somaliland and are using an airplane to distribute leaflets, inciting French troops to defect to Dao'an and Chailah with their weapons. These leaflets are signed by General Le Gentilehomme, the former commander of the French forces in East Africa. The Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway, which is now a vital passage for preventing famine in Abyssinia and evacuating wounded and sick soldiers, is very important. France will naturally negotiate with the shipowners to prevent the war from spreading to this railway. However, the French Somaliland authorities will never contact the Tegore rebels. The French government has issued instructions to the governor of French Somaliland on this matter in order to act accordingly. (28th Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: The Free French Headquarters in London stated that the Vichy government is spreading rumors that the Free French, with the help of the British army, are gathered near the border of French Somaliland. This kind of news should not be easily believed. However, this news clearly reports that there is a spontaneous movement among the French troops stationed in Djibouti, French Somaliland. It has long been known that the French troops and the people in that area support the Free French, and Djibouti was one of the first French territories to advocate continuing resistance after the Franco-German armistice. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Vichy: The Vichy government announced yesterday that two columns of Free French troops had stormed into French Somaliland, which is loyal to Vichy. The government issued a communique here stating, "We will fight the Tegore troops who landed on the coast." It is believed that the Free French troops landed in Chailah, and another landed near Djibouti. Another Free French force is attacking along the Addis Ababa railway. The Free French troops were forced to retreat when they landed on the coast because they encountered superior French forces loyal to the Vichy government. However, it is believed that this preparation is more complete than the Dakar affair. Vichy government officials believe that the Free French invasion of Somaliland is the prelude to the struggle between Vichy and General Tegore for the African empire, but they firmly believe that the officials and people of the French colony will be loyal to Vichy, and the Free French movement will eventually fail. However, neutral observers believe that the outcome of the struggle between Vichy and the Free French movement in Africa largely depends on the fate of the Axis and British armies in battle. If the Axis powers attack the Suez Canal and fail, or even retreat, the Free French movement will immediately have the opportunity to attack the Vichy forces from within and without. But if the Suez Canal falls and the British Empire in Africa begins to collapse, the Free French movement in "Black Africa" will have no chance. (29th International News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e25">War Spreads to the Near East; Britain Makes Necessary Preparations; Reinforces Iraq to Secure Communication Lines; Turkey's Future Attitude is Particularly Noteworthy <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Vichy: Military observers here recently stated that British Prime Minister Churchill mentioned the possibility of military action occurring in the Near East during his broadcast speech yesterday. Judging from the fact that 10,000 British troops have landed in Iraq, it can be seen that the British General Staff believes that the current European war is likely to expand to the Near East, and therefore has made the necessary preparations. Up to now, the Tigris and Euphrates valleys in Iraq have been defended by British troops coming from the Persian Gulf. According to news from the Egyptian capital, as soon as the British army retreats from Egypt to India, it will be responsible for securing communication lines. At the same time, Britain is also deploying forces in the Near East and maintaining contact with Turkey in order to resist the threat posed by the German and Italian forces to the islands of the Aegean Sea. In addition, Syria is also related to the Near East issue. If foreign troops enter Syria in the future to seek refuge due to defeat, they will naturally be dealt with in accordance with international law, that is, disarming them and confining them, just as the French army retreated into Switzerland in June last year. However, whether the current European war can expand to the Near East depends entirely on Turkey's attitude, because Turkey is the hub of Asia and Europe and the bridge between the Balkan War and the Eastern War. Therefore, before the outbreak of war in the East, both sides will demand that the Turkish government clarify its position. Recently, Axis newspapers have criticized Soviet policy, and the Italian "Oggi" even condemned the Soviet Union for encouraging Turkey to reject the conditions that the Axis powers should have proposed. All these points are noteworthy. (28th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>New York: American military experts said last night that Germany's military victory in the Balkans has enabled the Axis powers to launch an invasion of the Near East oil fields, as the Near East oil fields are the world's main source of fuel. American experts believe that various military obstacles, such as Turkey's neutrality and the Soviet Union's ambiguous response, may in fact delay Germany's advance into the Near East, but they admit that Germany's position has been greatly enhanced by the Balkan war. It is pointed out that the output of the Near East oil fields in Iran, Iraq, and Soviet Arabia is approximately 300,000 barrels per day, but their reserves of 20,000,000,000 barrels are almost equal to those of the United States, the world's largest oil producer. (29th International Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that Iraq and Iran have close relations under the Sa'dabad Pact, so the arrival of British troops in Iraq has the effect of calming the hearts of the Iranian people. However, according to reliable news received in London, some Iranian newspapers have been paying close attention to the news of German gains in Greece and advances in Libya. The newspapers speculate a lot about German plans and pay close attention to Turkey's attitude. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Vichy: Iraqi Foreign Minister Hissan da stated that the change of cabinet does not affect foreign policy. Iraq always maintains friendly relations with all countries and strives to avoid participating in the war. The agreement between Britain and Iraq must be strictly implemented. The passage of British troops is in accordance with the Anglo-Iraqi agreement. (29th Haitong Dispatch)</p>
