<h3 id="c22">社評　旣見之於管理物價後 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>兩租界當局出以迅雷不及掩耳之舉動，於本月十日已開始其租界區內管理物價之工作；而首先執行者，為民衆主耍食品之米糧。不週一起，將對於其他日用必需品規定其價格。至零售價超越於公定限價者，亦見受有停止營業之處分。言出法隨，雷厲風行，以視昔之三令五申，徒為奸商屯戶所利用，而無裨於平準之實者，何啻霄壤，足見兩租界當局關心民瘼，博採輿論，又得西董不憚跋涉，為民請命；中國政府睠懷滬民，特予接濟；昔以惠澤及民者為萬家生佛，今以之擬租界當局之作為，洵當之而無愧。</p>
<p>一般所以痛心疾首於屯戶者，為其狂抬物價，漫無止境；貪得無饜，危害民生；今已自食其報，束手就縛。民生得以安定，民食無虞匱乏，民用不慮拮据，果微租界當局之力不及此，夫善政以養民為先，除暴以安良為務，懲其旣往，策其未來，此大衆所以歡騰鼓舞於工部局之政策。惟是公衆之事萬有不齊，東西人情，風敎各殊，因時因地以制宜，而求社會之安寗，此又為政力持大體之說所由來，茲在推行伊始，防幣不容不嚴，辦理自求其澈底，有如目前棧存所登記者為六十三萬餘包，比照上屆存底調查，求其差異之額，明其盈虛之故，究其有無漏匿隱瞞，以儆刁風，此固事所當然而亦不容緩。若以查究屯積之故，而竟牽及居民之儲糧，是則窮其弊之所屆，苛細繁瑣，易滋敲詐勒索之風；閭閻騷擾，又非善政所以養民之旨。至於行廠公司為職工所購儲之米糧，雖非屯積可比，而大宗糧食固易於為屯戶所托詞朦蔽，此則如果用途證據明確，保證嚴密，自應許其按期出運分配於職工，非特循其應有之搬運手續，且亦須在警捕監視之下，方可出棧。至慮屯戶米商將米糧零星分藏於住家，以為隱匿之計，一則事絕瑣碎，以上每室狹人稠，能有多少可容藏；二則米價在嚴格限制之下，不論何種洋米，已售一律之價，除國米仍不受限制或以攙雜混售外，卽使有零星隱藏，非獨為數難多，且亦別無可以高價出售之途，頓失其屯積作用，固又何必多此一舉。要知屯以居積牟利為目的，其義相當於Hoard，價愈高，利愈厚，屯愈力，危害公衆亦愈深，故非懲處不可。儲以備食用為目的，自物價經屯積而不斷高漲，多數住戶，咸焦急於未來生活，有無保障，並鑒於已往種種設施，原欲以抑平物價，而物價終不能制；原欲以裁制屯戶，而屯戶之燄益張，於是從失望之餘，不得不自為計。何况物價之冲霄上騰、尤使人對於日用必需各品，在兩租界未有表示前，孰不欲早事購置，免多損失，此固人情之常，故儲之為義，相當於Reserve。今如以取締屯積，果以牽及儲藏，此不禁廻溯當年三國蜀漢時，天旱禁酒釀者，有刑吏於人家索得釀具，論者欲與作酒者同罰；簡雍與先主游觀，見一男女行道，謂先主曰；彼人欲行淫，何以不縛？先主問何以知之，雍對以彼有其具，與作釀者同；先主一笑而原欲釀者，故以取締屯積而幷及居家之儲藏，得母類於釀具淫具之禁耶！况中國以家無隔宿之糧，戶無擔石之儲為可悲；而西方家庭，有不速之客至，不及具餐，不以為異；蓋西方不欲多儲食品，固有今日有酒今日醉之風度；而東方從農村經濟相出發，數千年自執政以及民間，均以蓄積為重。平時對於屯儲之分際，不但自有其習慣上之見解，且亦自有其數量上之尺度，若兩租界必欲澈底明瞭民間所有之食物日用各品起見，則須派遺有智識道德之調查員，無分華洋居民一律待遇，按戶調查，不稍遺漏，並及其戶口多寡，而後彙輯統計之，分給購物證，以期分配之停勻，固亦不失為應有之義也。</p>
<p>界外之居民，同是中國之民衆；但兩租界所負之職責，只限於界內之治安，故其所與以為信約者唯此，所能實施管理之職權者亦唯此。本來上海之民食，向恃內地運濟，無慮缺乏，今則租界以內，以洋米為主，則界外民食，就內地所產，供內地食用本可不必再特租界洋米相挹注。故今日之民食問題，不患寡而患不均；若供求間相調勻，固綽乎有餘裕；卽租界內之運銷洋米，亦為多此、一舉矣。</p>
<p>現在上海存米充沛，而按月復可有局米接濟，待兩租界當局將界內投機屯積之塵氛廓淸，並管理食糧入於正軌，不至再有危害公益之舉後，應將現行升斗限糴制，擴大至五斗為度；蓋麻雀雖小，尚有寒雪糧，豈人必待舉爨始求糴耶！</p>
<p>雖然，民食問題有辦法，固已解除民衆一部分之困難；進而謀住的問題之改善，燃料問題之供應，三者能有相當之解決，則民衆之歡聲雷動，豈止範金絲繡而已哉！</p>

<p>次要物品性質複雜</p>
<p>淮口商暨製造家協會主席柯賴、昨日下午二時十五分、在工部局會議室招待全巿新聞界、說明協會組織情形以及工作方針、並由工部局情報處轉發書面文吿如下、「在過去一星期內、關於組織一進口商與製造家之協會、以協助工部局統制家用必需品之另售價格一層、報章曾競載共事、工部局對於食米一項、已採取嚴峻而最受歡迎之措置矣、現在期望賅局以同樣辦法、推及共他大量物品、此為一艱巨之工作，該局至少在若干時期內、難望能處置各種次要物品、此類物品、雖與一般外僑以及中等階級華人之日常生活、關係頗多、第以其種類之繁多、與夫性質之複雜、在事實上未許以應付米市之同樣辦法、予以處理、該局所採取之各種辦法、當與法租界當局合作實施、</p>
<p>基本原則在於限價</p>
<p>進口商協會現正積極組織、以協助工部局統制次要物品、其基本原則、為會員以渠等所認為合理之另售物價、經由該協會轉吿工部局、該局即予公布、作為官定價格、不得超過、倘有違犯、該局當根據新附則所賦予之權力、予以懲處、同時協會亦將協助該局，拒絕以仟何會昌所經營之貨物繼續供給該違犯之人、現在巳與法租界公董局商定、凡該協會所提出之價格、可為公董局接受、作為法租界內之官定物價、協會並為協助會員、以謀合理價格之供給平均輸入起見、擬即覓取平準基金委員會·各輪船公司·以及各國商務官員之合作、深信此項合作在各種與社會福利關係重要之物品方面、定能實現、</p>
<p>伙食藥品儘先管理</p>
<p>該協會之努力、目前集中於外國伙食公司與藥房經售之各項物品、至於日常生活所需之物品、如火油·毛絨。布帛·以及衣着等類、該兩業所經售者不多、此類物品、亦屬重要、必須於相當時期內、予以處理、但就一般而論、尚不能如食物·藥品以及同樣家庭用品之能立即邀獲該協會之努力耳、公司行號應工部局之請而投函倍克洋行、表示願意參加協會者、為數巳屬不少、協會仍在積極羅致更多之會員、藉使協會能擁有可能之最大力量、該協會現徇局方之緊急請求、巳先成立若干臨時委員會、計有普通委員會·宜傳委員會·零售委員會、各一、暨處埤藥房與外國伙食兩業之委員會若干、零售委員會巳擬具設置一零售商店之計劃、各該臨時委員會將來當代以正式選舉之委員會、</p>
<p>計口分配直接零售</p>
<p>根據經騐所得、任何統制機關不諭其為一單獨之進口行或一個團體、如工部局者、倘能自行供應貨物、以官定之價格發售市上者、則物價統制一事、較為輕而易舉、協會準備在必要時代簪不能零售之會員、担任零售工作、適當之房屋現巳覓得、並有相當之經濟後盾、將來前往購貨者、當給以一種身份證明卡紙、並常採取計口分配之辦法、藉以杜絕用戶囤儲、防止商人購買、</p>
<p>成件貨品應予拆散</p>
<p>希望現有之零售商人、能與當局完全合作、以謀樹立日用必需品售價之合理水準、於是、毌須另設置於協會管理下之特別發售所、零售商在維持官定價格（此項售價當給予一相當營業利潤）以外、擬冉請其辦理計口發賣事宜、並將物品盡量限售與經常顧客、同時僅以貨物應付顧客之目前需要、倘屬可能、物品之容器、應予開啓、或將標籤移去、·以防轉賣、在許多情形之中、進。商在分發同等數量之新貨以前、或將收回舊標籤、此事恐使公衆稍感不便、但須知所感不便者、厥為一般購買物品以圖囤儲或轉賣之徒、故公衆方面、一經明瞭此種情形以後、當不致表示反對也、協會並巳分函請求入會之申請人、請其說明現行批發價格、以及認為合理之零售物價、此外、請其將表列每種物品所需之外匯數目、一併估計開附、以使彙案向平準基金委員會申請核撥外匯</p>
<p>正常輸入首需維持會</p>
<p>有關係之小組委員會、將挑選其所認為最重要之各項物品、並向局方提供零售價格、以資公佈、該協會為求明瞭一般供給情形起見、或將請其會員報吿渠等擁有以及商人所有之存貨數目、該協會之最初目標、原為管理物價以利整個社會、以目前情形而論、巳逐漸證明協會對於確保適當與正常之物品供應、並獲致相當外滙一層、能貢獻最大之助力、此事或者終將成為其重嬰任務、物品之正常輸入倘能確立、則物價問題、當可迎刃而解、凡此所述、僅為協會進行方針之大綱、各進口商製造家以及零售商、欲得更詳盡之情形者、可向倍克洋行函詢一切、</p>

<p>一個男子如果身體虧弱，而沒有恢復健康的希望時，他將感覺到整個世界灰變成灰色，人家的歡樂，他妒視着，內心中格外發出無限的愁苦！這時，雖有嬌妻美妾亦不足以安慰他的心情；雖在襁褓的子女，然而他亦將寄以深遠的願望，可是虧弱的丈夫，偏偏又難能生育子女，於是他空中飄渺著，頃刻間而又幻減了！</p>
<p>男子漢大丈夫的身體應當如生龍活虎似的健壯，思想豊富，精力充沛，遇事奮發有爲，然後才是家庭間的安定勢力，社會國家的中流砥柱。而今何以身體虧弱，一至于此？據醫學上的論斷：多數必因早年犯有自　遺精，或早婚縱欲把生命源泉的生殖腺液消耗枯竭，則凡腦力衰弱，記憶不良，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，腎萎早泄，發育不全，未老先衰等症即不一而足，於是形容枯橋，志氣消沉，終日沒精打采的性生活上，使人生應享之幸福，常如泡影之幻滅，或竟完全不能人道，白白地斷送了自己和妻子的寶貴靑春，此在男子果然是無可奈何的事，可是妻子怎甘忍受呢？所以夫婦間的私奔自殺別局離婚等的慘劇，就時常的演出在普遍的社會中，因丈夫早亡，遺下孤兒寡妻的仱仃悲苦，這更是慘絕人寰！</p>
<p>今日醫學昌明，科學萬能，身體虧弱，儘可用培補而致健壯。上述各癥，那更有特效療法，在短期內即可根治：特效療法為何？旣世界醫聖斯丹那博士歴三十餘年艱辛實騐後所發明之生殖腺補給療法。法將雄壯動物如猩猩，猿猿，熊鹿，海狗等體中提取其生殖腺素，用濃縮覆制法，制成片濟，簡單言之，旣爲生殖腺素制劑「生殖素」。爲最富滋補性之內服劑，患者於服後一日夜間旣能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，繼續服用更可助長發</p>
<p>育，調整新陳代謝。必於短期內根治各症。常服更可收延年益壽，返老還童之效。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」以制止遺　，收效尤速！自內分泌醫學昌明後中外名醫大多數均採用此法，幷均認為最特效。余用此法治愈患者，亦已不下數萬人云。最近有胡益華君患腦衰腎虧甚劇，兼有遺精，偏服市上補劑，均如投石水中，無甚影響，上月胡君來所就醫，余察知其病狀後，旣囑其在中西大藥房購「生殖素」半打，「希米脫氏固精片」三匣，使其兩者兼服。爲時　及一月，果已見百病霍然，精力　足，不特辦事效率倍增，夫妻間愛情亦不勝其　　矣！</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3 id="c75">乳峯應與服飾相媲美　美國醫學博士姚崇培 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>雖然說：「三分人才七分裝」，但「鵝頭裝在鴨頸上」，畢竟是不甚相配的。一個瘦弱的女郎，乳峯萎痛得好像一個未發育的孩子，身段上一點沒有線美的流露，面部枯黃或慘白著全無紅潤的血色，此種女郎，雖穿上靜　綾羅，滿途胭脂，亦適足以益　其　而已。因爲時代的男子，對於女性審美的觀念，早已落重健康美了。所以女性的美麗，完全以健康為其基礎。一個女性如果乳峯發育良好，即可證明其　　機能的健全，而絕無經亂白帶，不感不刃等按疾。因此，自然血液充盈，體態苗條，面部紅潤而可愛，性情愉快而活潑。此種女郎若再服以入時的衣服，雖不施脂粉，亦覺美感動人，男人們見此種女性，必引以為心中的安琪兒，從旁稱贊者有之，決心追求勢必拜倒其石榴裙下者亦必大有人在。若良緣天成。一旦獲與如意郎君結婚，那婚後必然愛情　　，生育者伶俐的子女，組織者快樂的家庭，生活更是何等幸福！然則女性何以多乳癌顏衰？這大都因暗疾滋擾，致　　機能失健所致。任何女性若欲轉衰弱為健壯，變　陋為健美，均須培補其　　機能而根治其暗疾，世界名醫所公認之婦科聖藥，　　制劑女用「生殖素」，即為適應上述需要之最對癥良藥。婦女於服後即可調整止帶，培補　　機能·如繼續服用·必可根治各種暗疾，而使乳峯　起，面頰紅潤，增進健美。余憑多年之經驗，采用此劑而獲滿意之結果者亦已數萬人云。</p>
<h3 id="c76">遺精患者的唯一療法 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>一失足成千古恨，在今日科學萬能，射門事情都的補救辦法的時代，已不甚適合時宜了。不過，「失足」總是有着相當的危險，能夠不失足為最好。誠以青年人意志薄弱，理智未充，易為惡劣環境所誘惑。所以青年人交友必須審慎，淫書淫畫不可閱讀，低級趣味的娛樂塲所尤不宜於　足。因為這些塲合最易引起淫慾，慾念盛時，不達目的，犯着自　惡癖，或同性戀愛者真不計其數。要知自　縱慾，或早婚荒淫等不合理的性行為。最易　傷性神經，使精關鬆弛，爆發着可怖的遺精症！</p>
<p>遺精雖為每個未婚青年所常有的事情。有的因生理上所產生的精液積存過多，每月或數月偶有一二次的遺　，這是健壯男子因遲婚或與妻就久別的生理溢精現象，溢後且絲毫不損健康的。可是於一月之內有二三次以上的遺精，遺後感覺精神疲乏，頭昏欲睡等狀態者，此必是病態的遺精無疑。有此症象者必須及早治愈。則尚無大害，若因循失治，由輕症的夢遺進為重症的滑精漏精者有之，因遺精日久致精枯血竭，爆發着腦衰失眠，記憶不良，亂夢顛倒，日間疲困無神，腰酸背痛，腎萎早　，發育不全，未老先衰等症象者那更比比皆是，如此青年，將如何繼續其學業，專心一志於其職業？未婚者必為異性見棄，已婚者必為妻憎恨。於是前途茫然，幸福喪盡！遺精並不是不治之症，何以自誤誤人，一至於此！關於遺精的治療，據世界名醫及余經驗，均以服「希米脫氏固精片」為唯一特效之療法，此藥能鞏固精關，鎮靜神經，服後於當晚即能收安眠止遺之神效。如因遺精已有上述「生殖素」以培補腦腎精血及神經，能繼續服用，必可於短期內根治各」。如能來本診所兼用電療注射等法，則收效尤速！</p>

<h3 id="c77">治癆的新發明 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— 電德</p>
<p>希望市民注意治癆常識</p>
<p>癆病（結核病）在中國已經成了一種社會病，以上海而論，在惡劣的日光空氣和營養環境之下，正不知道有若干千萬的市民在這惡病下苟延着殘喘。這次某醫學院的新生檢查中，竟有三分之一的靑年患着相當嚴重的結核病症，山此一例，可概其餘。</p>
<p>癆病的可怕，不僅因為其傳佈普遍，尤其因為即使在　學昌明的今日，還沒有，個很好的療法，可以一舉而愈，致使患者常常纏綿終身，或療養數年，失却了生人的樂趣，和謀生競爭的能力。至於不治而死，無力支持這個「富貴病一的治療經費的人們，更是可憐了。癆病因傳染部位之各殊而異其性質，所以中翳有「七十二癆」之說，在西醫也因病部而分肺，腸，骨，泌尿部，皮膚，及眼結核等等的名稱。治法雖異，主要的方法還小外乎用日光，空氣　營養等攝生方法，求病人抵抗力增加而自愈。由此可知，人生各部幾乎都有傳染癆病的機會，而治愈則必須遷延時日，耗費金錢，甚至遷有喪生的危險，癆病是多麽可怕啊！</p>
<p>近年對於癆病治療的方法，已經是日新月異，有很大的進步，如手術療法的氣胸，肋骨切除，患部切除對於肺，腎，及外科結核，都可促其早愈。各種層出不窮的化學療法及血濟療法等偶而也可以奏效，但或則愈後器官殘缺，或則功效未彰，都還有待乎繼續的研究。現在經各國醫家硏究的結果，已經有了新的發見，這就是前途未可限量的光學治療啊！</p>
<p>過去也有用日光燈（內含紫外綫）及用大然日光浴治療結核的方法，對於骨癆等作中要的治療，但這和今天所談的新療法是不同的。</p>
<p>請過普通物理的人都知道有一種深度愛克司光（Deepxray）是用髙度電壓通過眞空而成的目不可見的超短波光錢，這種光綫透入力比Ｘ光更深，對於生物細胞的破壞力也更大。這種光綫，過去已使用於醫藥方面，用以破壞瘤，癌等的細胞及治頑固皮膚病等，極具卓效。現在經過周密的研究，發現這種光錢有透入人體醫治結核病的效用。因為它的光波震動和撞擊足以破壞結核病灶，使新生細胞易於恢復。這種光綫旣可以透入人體，所以可無深不達，無堅不摧。現在這個新的發明，正在全世界新進醫藥界實騐硏究之中，雖尚未完全披露其報吿，但已成為一種確立不搖的最新特效療法了。</p>
<p>在我國從事這種新研究的人也許很多，但作者見聞不廣，但知上海紅十字會醫院，北平協和醫院等研究已有成績，治愈者不乏其人。茲將最近所耳聞目睹的治療結果簡單來談談。</p>
<p>協和的硏究，僅限於初期而病灶不大的骨癆病人，證明有特殊效力。對有肺癆的病人則尚有很多的禁忌。其他方面現在進一步證明對於各種傷口不大，炎勢不重的外科結核（如關節炎）都可在半年左右，經過數十次照射而愈。但這種治療的反應在敏感的結核病人有時很大，如胃呆嘔吐，膿液加多，甚至熱度增髙，因之在施治方法上還有待於繼續研究，目下不過是初步的試探而已。但無論如何，這種療法一定有光明的前途，則是可以斷言的。</p>
<p>讀者們，大家注意這個患要的研究吧，希望它能够很快地得到圓滿的結果。這不但是專家們的義務，也需大家來支持的啊！鍾珣</p>

<p>— 鐘珣</p>
<p>美國有一所自然博物館，非常聞名，規模極大，收羅之廣，無不應有盡有，該館包括自然界之形形色色，如人類，禽獸，魚介，植物，鑛物等，標本，一應俱全，且說明得十分詳細。</p>
<p>美國人很曾利用博物館，連許多十幾歲的兒童都在那裹，圍着幾個動物的模型，拿着敎師給他們的問題作那裏細細地觀察，一面寫答案。這些模型都做得活龍活現，而且供學童硏究，比眞的動物患眞，因為眞的動物，也許在組成上新陳代謝，稍有出入，而這些模型都是典型的代表，一概齊全美國的學童眞可算得幸福，他們的標本室不僅是學校內部的一間，竟是全世界聞名的自然歷史博物館。</p>
<p>在自然歷史博物館的內部，更有一所天文館，所謂天文館者竟是將整個的天體，搬運到房子裹面去。它的構造是一個圓形的大屋頂，上面按照着天空的實情，配上各種星體，倘它是個行星的話，又替它裝置一條軌道。圓頂所范罩的屋內，圍着一排排的椅子，當中有個敎裘，並設置着一架複雜的機器。</p>
<p>講演時，全室電燈熄滅，輕輕發出一點音樂，坐在椅上的來賓，隔不多時，就會忘記自己坐在室內，竟像初夏時節，坐在庭園乘凉一樣。機關一開動，各種星體開始行動，動了些時，再由講演者按照次序，把各種星體的組成如何，它的歷史如何，它們的互相關係如何，一一加以說明，一面用口講，一面用圓頂上的星體表演；忽而彗星出現了，忽而銀河映演在面前了，忽而日月觸發生了，等會兒殞星墜地了，再等會兒月亮出現疏星隱下去了，少待父從現狀的說明，講到下一年可能的天體上各種的變化，已而收音機內發出雞啼的聲音，雀兒也都噪起來了，旭日東升，一小時的天文講演，就在你亳不覺着疲勞的情景下結束了。</p>
<p>讀過天文者或曾到天文裏去觀察過星象的人，他們的印象總是糢糊得很，聽了看了這番演講後，大體都可以明瞭。</p>
<p>他們竟運用科學方法，把天體搬到房子裹來實騐，做他們的民衆敎育。</p>

<p>為了增强國防程序，最近有人建議，一旦有事，美國每輛汽取都要能立即改裝為鋼甲車。這辦法是先造好牛吋鋼甲厚的坦克形外套，在緊急的時候很快地把它罩在汽車車身上，於是鋼甲汽車在頃刻之間便可出現了。但這必須先有一種大小固定的標凖汽車，否則車身大小差參不齊，就很不便了。這種鋼甲汽車會集起來在迎擊侵略者或傘兵時，可盡力不少。</p>

<h3 id="c82">遺產問題如何解決？ <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— 木風</p>
<p>「桃花湖」中正確答覆</p>
<p>在歐美各國的影片中，我們時常看到，當一個大富翁逝世後，早經立下遺囑，把遺產每一部份都玄配好，指定捐給醫院，學校，圖書館，或贈與工廠，農塲，發展工業，農業等，子女們並無什麼特殊利益可享的。但在中國，却因世襲的傳統觀念，往往為了遺產問題，閙成析產悲劇，甚至不惜引起訴訟，最近羅迦陵逝世後，因七萬萬元的遺產，正閙得滿城風雨呢。</p>
<p>關於這一種複雜多角的遺產問題，在金星新作「桃花湖」中，却指出一個正確的答覆，那就是利用遺產推進社會事業，建設農塲，以謀大衆福利，勞資雙方精誠合作。這，非但穩固個人的事業與地位，而且也是改善社會制度的先聲。</p>
<p>「桃花湖」雖是鄭正秋當年的遺作，但是題材現實，正也適合現時代。該片並巳決定下星期三，開始在金城大戲院獻映。演員陣容計有胡楓，舒適，陳琦，周起，尤光照，徐賢，徐佐雯等，導演人正是鄭正秋先生的公郎鄭小秋君，所以正恰巧也是一份遺產，不過這是屬於電影藝術方面的。</p>

<p>— 義道</p>

<h3 id="e1">US Neutrality Act Amendment Passes House, President Roosevelt to Sign into Law, Full Arming of Merchant Ships to be Completed Within Four Months <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Washington, D.C., United Press, 14th—Yesterday, by a narrow margin of eighteen votes, the House approved the Neutrality Act Amendment, permitting the arming of American merchant ships and their entry into belligerent ports. The passage of this bill averts an unprecedented failure for President Roosevelt at a critical juncture in his foreign policy and allows the American fleet to fulfill President Roosevelt’s promise to “deliver goods to England.” The House approved the Senate amendment by a vote of 212 to 194. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull both made urgent appeals for the passage of the bill and warned that its rejection would "delight the Axis powers" and encourage strikes. With the bill now passed, it has been officially submitted to the White House for President Roosevelt’s signature. As a result of this new law, American merchant vessels will be armed to defend themselves against "enemy" attacks and submarines throughout the world, and will be allowed to enter belligerent ports and war zones. The House convened in a tense atmosphere yesterday to vote. Government leaders hinted at surprising measures to deal with a "rebellion" that had occurred beforehand, as many government supporters reversed their previous positions, apparently because the administration was unwilling to take strict measures to deal with the widespread labor unrest. The administration issued appeals to absent supporters, requesting they return to the House to vote, but to no avail. Seven of them were on an inspection tour in Latin America, and the other two were in Los Angeles and unable to purchase plane tickets. The scene in the Capitol yesterday was the most dramatic since World War I. Hundreds of people tried to break through the special guards and crowd into the corridors. Illinois Democratic Representative Arnold and Virginia Democratic Representative Flanagan both supported the repeal of the Neutrality Act. Flanagan argued that the sea lanes to England, China, and the Soviet Union were the "lifelines of the world" and urged that "for the sake of the well-being of our people, we maintain the smooth operation of these sea lanes." Speaker Rayburn read President Roosevelt's letter to the House before the vote was immediately held. After the votes were counted and it was confirmed that the bill had passed, Rayburn signed it. However, as the Senate is currently in recess, the Vice President will sign on behalf of the Senate on Monday. President Roosevelt is expected to sign it on Monday. The Navy Department has already allocated a number of cannons for arming merchant vessels. It is widely believed that American ships will gradually be deployed to the supply lines to England and the Soviet Union. A representative from South Carolina declared at the end of the debate that the Senate amendment was "tantamount to entering the war through the back door."</p>
<p>Washington, D.C., United Press, 14th—Congressional leaders, speaking in the Capitol corridors after the meeting, said that the next historic vote would be on the question of the United States declaring war or something close to it. The House's passage of the Neutrality Act Amendment is seen as authorizing President Roosevelt to continue the government's anti-Axis policy. Of the 212 votes in favor of passing the amendment, 189 were cast by Democrats, 22 by Republicans, and 1 by a Labor representative. There were 194 votes against, 53 from Democrats, 137 from Republicans, 1 from the Farmer-Labor Party, and 3 from the Progressive Party.</p>
<p>Washington, D.C., United Press, 14th—The US Navy is preparing to deploy cannons and gunners to American merchant ships as soon as the President signs the Neutrality Act Amendment on Monday. The Maritime Commission is also preparing to send American ships through the submarine-infested Atlantic to British ports. Officials say that the ships assigned to the more dangerous routes will be equipped with cannons first. Gunners are already waiting at the ports to board the ships. According to current plans, coastal ships are not being prepared for arming, at least not until the ocean-going ships have been equipped with cannons and gunners, or the threat of submarines has developed along the coast. Secretary of the Navy Knox recently stated that merchant ships will be equipped with 3-inch, 4-inch, or 5-inch caliber cannons, depending on their construction. The new 5-inch dual-purpose guns will probably only be installed on new ships, as they require special gun mounts to accommodate the recoil. These 5-inch dual-purpose guns can be used to shoot at both submarines and aircraft.</p>
<p>Air and Sea Routes to England to be Rapidly Expanded</p>
<p>Washington, D.C., Reuters, 14th—Now that the Neutrality Act has been amended, those responsible expect that American activities on the air and sea routes to England will be rapidly and generally expanded. Secretary of the Navy Knox firmly indicated last night the scope of this expansion, saying that the House's action enables the United States to now decide how best to use merchant ships to carry supplies to any part of the world where they can be of beneficial use. It is expected on other fronts that the expanded activities will include the following steps: 　Expanding naval and air patrols and convoys to the remaining portions of the route across the Atlantic Ocean to the British Isles; 　Establishing American bases in the British Isles, or sharing existing bases there if necessary; 　Extending convoys through Gibraltar to British Mediterranean ports, shortening the time it takes for supplies to reach Egypt; 　Sending American Army bombers across the Atlantic to England, expanding the Army's existing control of inland crossings. According to Knox's statement, the United States is the only country with the capacity to supply the sailors needed to crew the large number of merchant ships currently being built in America. England has been harmed by a lack of manpower, especially for those serving at sea. For this reason, the issue of flying planes across the Atlantic is being discussed. The Navy Department has now begun preparations to equip all merchant ships with gun mounts as soon as President Roosevelt signs the new bill. It is said that the gun mounts have already been installed on a number of merchant ships. It is expected that the full arming of merchant ships can be completed within four months. Since the outbreak of the war, the Shipping Board is for the first time preparing to expand the commercial routes operated by merchant ships.</p>
<p>Rayburn and McCormack Worked Hard to Assist the Government</p>
<p>Washington, D.C., Reuters, 14th—House Speaker Rayburn made great efforts before the vote to prevent a failure of the government's foreign policy, reading aloud the letter he and McCormack sent to the President, as well as the President's reply. In their letter to the President, Rayburn and McCormack asked what impact it would have on America's position abroad, especially in Germany, if the House did not pass the amended text already passed by the Senate. The President's reply clearly stated that if the House rejected this amendment, Germany and other aggressor nations would become even more arrogant and continue their aggression, while China, England, and the Soviet Union would be disappointed, and America's efforts to manufacture various goods would also be thwarted.　In his message to Congress on October 9, he earnestly advocated arming merchant ships and abolishing the ban on American ships entering war zones, considering both matters to be extremely important. At that time, he indicated that the former was an urgent matter of utmost importance. Now, a month later, he considers the latter to be equally important to the former. After Rayburn read this letter, McCormack was authorized to read a letter from Secretary of State Hull, which briefly stated that the passage of this bill was urgently needed and that America's defense line must be as broad as the danger facing America. In today's environment, we must be free to arm merchant ships for self-defense, and we must also be free to use armed ships in emergencies to transport supplies to the countries that are currently resisting the attempt to conquer the world being waged against us. The American government will, of course, use the powers granted by this bill with caution. Finally, a number of influential Republican congressmen also supported the Democratic leaders in their plea for the passage of this bill, resulting in its passage by a majority. Speaker Rayburn signed the bill immediately after the vote so that it could be sent to the White House for the President's signature. As the bill had already passed the Senate a week earlier by a vote of fifty to thirty-seven, it will become law upon the President's signature.</p>
<p>Washington, D.C., Reuters, 14th—After receiving the news that the Neutrality Act Amendment had passed in the House, President Roosevelt immediately thanked House Speaker Rayburn and McCormack in a personal capacity. The White House secretary stated that the President was naturally pleased with this outcome. The atmosphere during the debates on Wednesday and Thursday was very calm, with a focus on reasoned study and none of the usual outbursts of anger. The galleries were crowded, and thousands who could not get in waited outside the doors to hear the news. Police said that the number of people trying to enter the galleries was unprecedented.</p>
<p>Another Layer of Protection for the Victory of China, England, and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Washington, D.C., Reuters, 14th—Secretary of the Navy Knox told reporters yesterday that in his view, the House's passage of the Neutrality Act Amendment would ensure a greater chance of ultimate victory for the war efforts of China, England, and the Soviet Union, and would ensure that there are sufficient ships and personnel to deliver the war materials that will help the democratic nations win to key locations.</p>
<p>Washington, D.C., Reuters, 14th—It was learned today that the Navy Department's plan to arm merchant ships is now prepared to be implemented immediately after the Neutrality Act Amendment comes into effect. Secretary of State Hull commented on the outcome of the House vote, saying it was an extremely wise and timely decision.</p>
<p>London, United Press, 14th—It is believed here that the passage of the US Neutrality Act Amendment will strengthen the diplomatic policies of England and the United States toward Japan. There were previous deep concerns that the rejection of the Neutrality Act Amendment on the eve of Special Envoy Kurusu's arrival in the United States would greatly weaken Washington's policies toward Japan. Due to Prime Minister Churchill's speech to the City Council, it is now widely believed that additional British warships, including powerful battleships, will appear in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is also believed that this move will give Japan fresh advice and encourage it to reflect on its actions. After the news of the passage of the Neutrality Act Amendment came, the government and the people expressed joy. However, Japanese authorities said that the important significance of the amendment's passage lies not in the actual benefits it brings to Britain, but in recognizing that the United States Congress has decided to risk ensuring the safe arrival of American supplies to the countries it is helping.</p>
<p>London, United Press, 14th—At a banquet last night of the Naval Auxiliary Patrol Association, US Ambassador Winant specifically asked a speaker to stop his speech and announced that the House had passed the Neutrality Act Amendment, allowing American merchant ships to be armed and enter belligerent ports. This report from Winant, which indicated that the United States could "deliver goods" to England, was greeted with loud cheers, expressing a warm welcome.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Kurusu Leaves Honolulu for the US, Washington is Paying Attention, Eastern News Says Talks Will Eventually Stall <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Honolulu, United Press, 14th—Japanese Special Envoy Kurusu flew to the United States yesterday afternoon aboard the China Clipper.</p>
<p>Washington, D.C., International News Service, 14th—Kurusu may arrive in San Francisco today and is expected to fly to Washington.</p>
<p>Washington, D.C., United Press, 14th—Last evening, attention was given here to the imminent arrival of Japanese Special Envoy Kurusu. Senators are divided on whether Kurusu's visit to the US can resolve the Pacific conflict. Senator Connally, the influential chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, believes that, on the surface, "a satisfactory resolution with Japan seems quite optimistic." Montana Democratic Senator Murray said he sees "war as an absolute possibility, because the Japanese military will not give way." Utah Democratic Senator Thomas believes that Kurusu's trip will help resolve the Pacific crisis, adding that "smart heads can still save the situation." Montana's well-known isolationist Senator Wheeler expressed doubt about war, saying, "I believe that the Japanese and American people do not want war to happen."</p>
<p>Tokyo, United Press, 14th—Today, Japanese newspapers strongly commented that if the United States captures Japanese residents during the war, Japan will also take retaliatory measures. Newspapers also advised American leaders not to make threatening remarks to Japan if they desire peace in the Pacific. Another newspaper said that the US-Japan "Washington talks should start anew." The nationalist "Hochi Shimbun" believes that the United States is ignoring Japan's peaceful intentions and is preparing to wage war against Japan, "unless Japan accepts humiliating conditions." It also said that the Japanese government and Kurusu should "keep this in mind and start anew in Washington." Furthermore, it said that unless the United States reconsiders, the two countries are not far from "the point of rupture." The Yomiuri Shimbun said that if American government leaders want to maintain peace in the Pacific, they should not make threats to Japan, as this "will arouse the emotions of the Japanese people and cause a rupture." The newspaper expressed "surprise" at the statement by US Attorney Biddle that the United States is prepared to arrest Japanese residents in the event of an emergency. The newspaper acknowledged that any belligerent nation has the right to arrest the residents of another belligerent nation, but said, "If the United States takes this action, we will also respond. We will not only imprison every American resident within the Japanese Empire, but we will also imprison every American resident within the Japanese sphere of influence. In war, we will respond in kind, an eye for an eye, as Mr. Biddle instructs us." The newspaper also said, "We will not only detain American residents, but we will also dispose of American territory at will at that time."</p>
<h3 id="e3">Famous British Aircraft Carrier Ark Royal Sunk, Torpedoed by German Submarine East of Gibraltar, Naval Headquarters Announces Casualties Not High <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>London, Reuters, 14th—The British aircraft carrier Ark Royal has been reported sunk while being towed into port after being torpedoed by a German submarine. Details of the casualties are not yet known, but based on reports received, it is fortunate that the number of casualties is not high, as it is known that a very large proportion of the ship's crew have been rescued. The relatives of those killed in action will be notified as soon as possible. According to responsible sources, the ship was attacked east of Gibraltar.</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 14th—According to a statement issued by the Naval Headquarters, the famous British aircraft carrier Ark Royal, which German Propaganda Minister Goebbels had ideally sunk many times, has now sunk to the bottom of the sea in the Mediterranean after many heroic battles and while being towed back for repairs after being torpedoed. The ship's construction took two and a half years and cost over three million pounds. It was launched in early 1937 and had a displacement of 27,000 tons when fully loaded, with a speed of 32 knots per hour. Its armament included sixteen 4.5-inch caliber gun mounts. Captain Maund, the ship's captain, had previously served as captain of the aircraft carrier Courageous and as a senior officer on the aircraft carrier Courageous, the first aircraft carrier sunk in this war. According to disclosed information, the ship had hunted submarines, searched for raiders, protected troops and convoys from the Arctic Circle to the Cape of Good Hope, and played an important role in the sinking of the Bismarck. The ship's last activities were in the Mediterranean, protecting important convoys. The planes that fought from this ship had shot down or seriously damaged over one hundred German and Italian planes in this war.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Reuters, 14th—The British Naval Headquarters announced this afternoon that the aircraft carrier Ark Royal, which had been attacked by German bombers in 1939, has been sunk. After repairs, it returned to service in the Mediterranean. The ship was 240 meters long and could carry 60 aircraft.</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 14th—According to news today, Captain Vian, the captain of the British destroyer Cossack, which was reported sunk on Sunday, is now missing or has been killed in action.</p>
<h3 id="e4">US President Orders Withdrawal of Marines Stationed in China, Over Nine Hundred People in Shanghai and Tianjin, Yangtze River Fleet Not Included <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Washington, D.C., United Press urgent dispatch, 14th—President Roosevelt today ordered the withdrawal of all US Marines from China, but warned reporters not to interpret this move as preparation for a break with Japan. The President's order will affect 750 Marines in Shanghai, 165 in Beijing, and 55 in Tianjin. The President read a brief statement at a press briefing today, announcing the withdrawal of US Marines from Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. When asked if withdrawing the garrison in China meant leaving any American interests unprotected, the President replied that there were not many Americans being protected by the Marines. It is widely believed that the US Marines in Shanghai will withdraw within a week or even take any President liners currently being converted into transport ships to the United States. The President expressed caution and refused to answer questions about whether the order to withdraw the Marines was a preparation for ending relations with Japan. When asked if his order would affect the few gunboats of the Yangtze River Fleet remaining in occupied China, the President replied that warships were under the control of the Navy and had nothing to do with the Marines. The President also said that he currently has no plans to meet with the Japanese special envoy.</p>
<h3 id="e5">China, England, and the US United in Defending the Burma Road <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Washington, D.C., International News Service, 14th—It has been learned from the highest authorities that the US government is determined to support the Yunnan-Burma Road as a supply route for China, as this is very important to US national defense. In the event that the road is attacked by Japan, the US government will take concerted action with China and England to protect this important transportation line. It is reported that this move is based on an agreement reached between Chongqing and London. It is believed that the nature of the agreement and the actions to be taken are secrets of national defense. However, it is known that England and the United States are both helping China defend this road against Japanese attacks. General Magruder, leader of the US military mission to China, is currently in Kunming. According to reports received here, elite Chinese troops are concentrating there to resist any attacks on the road through Yunnan Province.</p>

<h3 id="e7">Closer Economic Cooperation Between China, England, and the United States, Further Strengthening Relations, England and the US Simultaneously Revise Laws on Freezing Funds to China, All Trade Remittances Controlled by the Exchange Stabilization Fund <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>London—The simultaneous announcement by the British and American governments of new measures regarding trade finance with China is viewed by London banking circles as a foreign exchange control plan for China. This plan, which China itself cannot easily implement, will be operated by England, the United States, and other Allied nations such as the Dutch East Indies, the Soviet Union, and the Belgian Congo. It is widely believed that China will now receive the foreign exchange it deserves. In the past, Chinese exports did not hand over the foreign exchange they earned to the central government, resulting in a major leak in China's foreign exchange sources. But this will no longer be the case, as the price of goods sold must be paid to a designated bank. Under this new system, all imports from any Chinese port will be controlled at their destination. London banking circles received notice of the new system yesterday, and all trade will be settled at official exchange rates, with the exchange rate of the legal tender being three and sixteen thirty-secondths pence to one and twelve and thirty-secondths pence. The designated banks are the American Express Bank, the Bank of Canton, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of East Asia, the Banque Belge pour l'Etranger, the Mercantile Bank of India, the Chase Bank, the Chekiang Industrial Bank, the Sino-Italian Bank, the Compagnie Franco-Chinoise de Tramways et d'Eclairage, the Farmers Bank of China, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the Kincheng Banking Corporation, the Mercantile Bank of India Limited, the Moscow Narodny Bank, the National City Bank of New York, the National Commercial Bank of Chekiang, the Netherlands Trading Society, the Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation, Sassoon Banking, the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, and the United States Bank. According to this system, Chinese goods imported into the British Empire and British goods transported to China must be subject to the condition of payment to the aforementioned banks. As the Japanese are entrenched in Chinese customs, they can interfere with Chinese exports, but apart from Tianjin, there is unlikely to be serious interference. This new system is the direct result of a meeting between Chinese, British, and American banks in Hong Kong, with the assistance of the Exchange Stabilization Fund. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong—The US Treasury Department announced on the 12th the revision of the Fund Freezing Act promulgated on June 26, 1941, and stated that new licenses have also been issued regarding the remittance of funds to China. Under the newly revised regulations, all commercial transactions between the United States and China must be under the control of the Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee. The purpose of the regulations is to ensure that the foreign exchange obtained from the approval of goods and remittances is completely under the control of the Stabilization Fund. Subsequently, all imports and exports will be handled by designated or specially approved banks. These banks must obtain the approval of the Stabilization Fund for the purchase and sale of foreign exchange and must comply with the regulations established by the Stabilization Fund. In order to more effectively control the goods imported into China, the US Treasury Department has instructed US customs authorities to inspect documentary evidence before approving the export of goods to prove that the various conditions established by the Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund have been complied with. In order to more effectively control Chinese exports, US consuls in China have also been instructed that in the future, all exporters must be notified in advance by the specially approved banks to the US consuls that the exporter has agreed with the specially approved bank on appropriate measures to sell US dollars to the specially approved bank before a consular visa can be issued. This new license is designed for remittances to China. Any amount of remittances can be remitted to various parts of China, except for the three northeastern provinces. However, the US dollars obtained from these remittances must be controlled by the Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund and allocated at any time. US dollars deposited in Chinese frozen and non-frozen accounts can be remitted uniformly. The US Treasury Department has obtained the consent of the Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund to grant the following Chinese commercial banks ordinary license status, certifying that they are specially approved banks: Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Bank of East Asia, National Commercial Bank, Chekiang Industrial Bank, Guangdong Provincial Bank, Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation, Kincheng Banking Corporation, Zhongxing Bank. In addition, there are the following specially approved banks: Bank of China, Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, Chase Bank, International Banking Corporation, Allied Bank, American Express Bank, Moscow Bank, C. Tong &amp; Co., Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Mercantile Bank of India Limited, Old Sassoon Banking, New Sassoon Banking, Netherlands Trading Society. The above specially approved banks should cooperate with the Stabilization Fund to ensure that the new regulations promulgated by the US Treasury Department are effective and achieve the desired goals. According to the Stabilization Fund, the Fund is now actively formulating steps to advance this task, hoping to complete the goal of cooperation between China, England, and the United States with simple procedures and the greatest efforts.

<p>Chongqing: While the attention of the Chinese people is focused on the outcome of Kuru's mission to the United States and the future development of US-Japan relations, they are also very concerned about two major domestic conferences in the future: the Ninth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee and the National Political Council.

A large part of the agenda will depend on international and domestic developments before the meeting. However, it is heard that as of now, the meeting does not plan to make any major changes to foreign policy or internal affairs, and it seems that it will focus on reviewing international and domestic developments and discussing how to implement the resolutions passed at the previous meeting, including the Five-Year Construction Program. Although there are rumors that there may be changes in the personnel of the Chinese government after the meeting, this has not been confirmed by officials so far. (Reuters News Agency, 14th)</p>

<h3 id="e16">Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly War Situation; 7th to 13th <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission said that the movements of the Japanese army this week (November 7th to 13th) are actively brewing a new war. There were no major battles on any battlefields. The Japanese troops on the Zhongmu and Xinyang routes have returned to their original positions. The Japanese troops at the southern end of the Yellow River Railway Bridge are stubbornly resisting, relying on the Guangwushan heights. The Chinese army is still constantly encircling and suppressing them, inflicting damage on the Japanese. The details are as follows: In southern Henan, the original position has been restored. On the 1st, the Japanese troops who invaded northward from Xinyang entered Runan on the 3rd, and again invaded Shangcai and Xiangcheng on the 4th. They were defeated by the Chinese army at noon, and the defeated Japanese troops retreated. The Chinese army took advantage of the situation to launch a fierce attack on Runan, and the Chinese army captured the city by night. The Japanese troops retreated southward, and a group stationed in Zhumadian was also defeated by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops who invaded the southeast of Queshan entered Queshanpo on the 4th, and continued to harass Wagang and other places to the west with a part of their troops. The Chinese army surrounded the Japanese troops and killed many of them. At the same time, the Chinese army that conquered Zhumadian launched a fierce advance to the south, defeating the Japanese troops entrenched in Queshan. The Japanese abandoned several corpses and retreated to Xin'andian. The Chinese army advanced in multiple directions, and successively recovered Zhengyang City and Xin'andian on the 5th, killing and wounding hundreds of Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese troops fled in panic across the Huaihe River and retreated to the south. The scattered troops that did not have time to cross the river have been completely wiped out by the Chinese army. Most of the Japanese troops surrounded by the Chinese army near Wagang were killed by the Chinese army. The rest broke through to the south on the morning of the 7th, and a part was intercepted and killed by the Chinese army in the Maoji area. On the afternoon of the 6th, more than 2,000 Japanese troops who invaded from Xinyang via Pingchangguan and Xingji to Dashankou, Mingshanding, Yongyangtai, and other places were resisted by the Chinese army. After a fierce battle until the evening of the 7th, more than 400 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. The Japanese troops could not withstand the attack and retreated to Xinyang, and have now returned to their original positions before the war. On the south bank of the Yellow River, in the fierce battle, the Chinese army encircled and attacked the Japanese troops stationed on the banks of the new and old Yellow Rivers, and continued to make progress in recent days. By the morning of the 7th, they had successively captured the high points to the southeast of Overlord City and the heights north of Sunzhai. In the area north of Handong, the Japanese attempted a last-ditch struggle, and launched a counterattack against the Chinese army under the cover of heavy artillery fire and aircraft bombing after reinforcements from the north bank. The attempt ultimately failed, and they are still fighting the Japanese army in the area from Handong Dagouxi to Overlord City. As for the Japanese troops who retreated in the direction of Zhongmu, after being besieged by the Chinese army, they completely captured the right bank of the Jialu River and the villages in the western suburbs of Zhongmu by dawn on the 6th, driving the Japanese troops to the left bank of the Jialu River and into Zhongmu City. Although the Japanese sent reinforcements to counterattack, they were suppressed by the Chinese army and have not succeeded. They are currently facing each other across the river in their original positions. (14th telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e21">The Foundation of World Peace Rests on the Far East; Gu Weijun Delivers a Speech in the UK <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>London: Chinese Ambassador to the UK, Gu Weijun, gave a speech at the Oxford Union today, saying that for the sake of achieving lasting peace, the Far East must also achieve victory like the West. Overthrowing the Japanese military dictatorship is as urgent as overthrowing the dictatorship of its sinister partners in Europe. Lincoln once said that the United States of America cannot exist in a state of half freedom and half slavery. Today's world, shortened by scientific inventions, and the welfare of the world, depends on the cooperation of all countries, so the world can never be half liberated and half enslaved. The whole world must be liberated from military dictatorship, otherwise the world of tomorrow will not be able to achieve lasting reform. If the Allied countries in Europe achieve their military victory and allow Asia to be ravaged by Japanese military power, then the so-called victory is by no means a true victory, and its result will prove to be a temporary illusion. At that time, the war in Europe may end, but in reality, it is only a temporary truce. If the defenders of Western freedom consider their work to be completed before defeating the dictatorship in Europe, then the mistake they have made is the same in nature as when Japan first launched its destruction of China's independence and sovereignty ten years ago, when they underestimated the significance of the Japanese actions. For the sake of humanity, this mistake must not be repeated. Earlier this week, Ambassador Gu visited Oxford for a two-day trip and was warmly welcomed by all parties. In addition to speaking at the Oxford Union, the Ambassador also gave a speech at the Chatham House Research Institute, attended by twenty experts on Far Eastern issues, during a two-hour symposium. Today, the Oxford Chinese Association hosted a banquet for the Ambassador and elected the Ambassador as the Chinese Chairman of the Board. The Ambassador also gave a speech at the Brins Club the other day, entitled "Democracy in Wartime China", and was elected as the Honorary President of the Club. (12th telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e22">Editorial: Seen in the Aftermath of Price Controls <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The authorities of the two concessions, acting with lightning speed, began their work on controlling prices within their concession areas on the 10th of this month. The first item to be implemented was rice, the staple food of the people. Starting next week, prices will be set for other daily necessities. Retailers who exceed the official price limit will be subject to suspension of business. Words were followed by action, swift and decisive. Compared to the past, when repeated orders and injunctions were merely exploited by unscrupulous merchants and hoarders, without contributing to the actual stabilization of prices, the difference is like heaven and earth. This shows that the authorities of the two concessions are concerned about the people's suffering, widely adopt public opinion, and that Western Directors did not hesitate to travel long distances to plead for the people. The Chinese government cherishes the people of Shanghai and provides special assistance. In the past, those who benefited the people were considered ten thousand families living Buddhas, and to compare the actions of the concession authorities to this is truly fitting and not undeserved.</p>
<p>What generally makes people feel heartbroken about hoarders is their rampant price increases, without any limit. Their insatiable greed harms the people's livelihood. Now they have reaped their own reward and are bound hand and foot. The people's livelihood can be stabilized, their food supply is not in danger of running out, and they do not have to worry about being strapped for daily necessities. If it were not for the power of the concession authorities, it would not be possible to achieve this. Good governance prioritizes nourishing the people, and eliminating violence prioritizes pacifying the good. Punishing the past and planning for the future, this is why the public cheers and rejoices at the policies of the Municipal Council. However, public affairs are always uneven, and Eastern and Western customs and education are different. Adapting to the times and places to seek social stability, this is the origin of the saying that government must maintain the overall situation. Now, at the beginning of implementation, precautions must be strict, and handling must be thorough. For example, the current registered storage is more than 630,000 bags. Comparing this to the previous inventory survey, the difference in amount should be sought, the reason for the surplus or deficit should be clarified, and it should be investigated whether there are any omissions or concealments, so as to warn against cunning practices. This is of course what should be done and cannot be delayed. If the investigation into hoarding is extended to the residents' food storage, then the pursuit of drawbacks will be exhausted, and excessive attention to detail will easily lead to extortion and blackmail. Harassment of the common people is not the purpose of good governance to nourish the people. As for the rice stored by factories and companies for their employees, although it is not comparable to hoarding, large quantities of food are easily used by hoarders as an excuse for obfuscation. In this case, if the purpose and evidence are clear and the guarantees are strict, they should be allowed to be transported and distributed to the employees on schedule. Not only should the necessary handling procedures be followed, but also they must be under the supervision of the police before they can be released from the warehouse. As for worrying that hoarders and rice merchants will hide rice in their homes in small quantities as a means of concealment, on the one hand, the matter is extremely trivial. Since each room is crowded with people, how much can be stored? On the other hand, with the price of rice under strict control, all imported rice is sold at the same price, except for domestic rice, which is still unrestricted or mixed for sale. Even if there is small-scale concealment, not only will the amount be difficult to be large, but also there is no way to sell it at a high price, and the hoarding effect is lost, so why bother with this? It should be known that hoarding is for the purpose of accumulation for profit. Its meaning is equivalent to "hoard." The higher the price, the thicker the profit, the stronger the hoarding, and the deeper the harm to the public, so it must be punished. Storage is for the purpose of preparation for consumption. Since prices have been constantly rising due to hoarding, most residents are anxious about the future, whether there is any guarantee of their livelihood, and in view of the various facilities in the past, which originally wanted to suppress prices, but prices ultimately could not be controlled; originally wanted to restrain hoarders, but the flames of hoarders have become more rampant, so after disappointment, they have to plan for themselves. Moreover, the soaring prices make people want to purchase daily necessities as early as possible, before the two concessions have made a statement, to avoid more losses. This is the normal state of human affairs, so the meaning of storage is equivalent to "reserve." Now, if the crackdown on hoarding is extended to storage, it cannot help but recall the time of the Three Kingdoms Shu Han, when there was a drought and the brewing of wine was prohibited. A criminal officer searched people's homes and found brewing equipment. Those who wanted to punish were the same as those who made wine. Jian Yong and the former lord toured and saw a man and woman walking on the road. He said to the former lord, "Those people want to commit adultery, why not bind them?" The former lord asked how he knew, and Yong replied that they had the equipment, the same as those who made wine. The former lord smiled and forgave those who wanted to brew. Therefore, banning hoarding and also including home storage, is it not similar to the prohibition of brewing and adulterous equipment? Moreover, in China, it is considered sad if a family has no food to last overnight and a household has no storage of stone. In Western families, if an unexpected guest arrives and there is not enough food to provide a meal, it is not considered strange. Because the West does not want to store much food, there is a style of "drink today and be drunk today." In the East, starting from the rural economy, for thousands of years, from the ruling class to the common people, accumulation has been valued. In peacetime, there is not only their own customary understanding of the distinction between hoarding and storage, but also their own scale of quantity. If the two concessions must thoroughly understand all the food and daily necessities of the people, then they must send investigators with knowledge and morals, treat Chinese and foreign residents equally, investigate each household, without any omission, and also investigate the size of their population, and then compile and statistically analyze them, and distribute shopping vouchers, in order to achieve an even distribution, which is also a necessary act.</p>
<p>The residents outside the concessions are also Chinese citizens; however, the responsibilities borne by the two concessions are limited to the security within the concessions, so what they agree to be bound by is only this, and what they can implement are only the powers of management. Originally, the food supply of Shanghai depended on the transportation from the interior, and there was no need to worry about lack. Now, within the concessions, imported rice is the main source, so the food supply outside the concessions, which is produced in the interior, can be supplied to the interior for consumption without needing imported rice from the concessions to be used to supplement them. Therefore, today's food problem is not about scarcity but about uneven distribution. If the supply and demand are balanced, there is more than enough. Even the distribution of imported rice within the concessions is superfluous.</p>
<p>Currently, there is an abundance of rice stored in Shanghai, and there is a monthly supply of bureau rice. After the authorities of the two concessions have cleared the atmosphere of speculation and hoarding within the concessions, and put food management on the right track, so that there will be no more acts that harm the public interest, the current system of limiting purchases by the "sheng" and "dou" should be expanded to five "dou." A sparrow may be small, but it still has winter food. How can people only seek to purchase rice when they are about to cook?</p>
<p>Although the food problem has a solution, it has already relieved part of the difficulties of the people. Moving forward to seek to improve the housing problem and supply the fuel problem, if the three can be adequately resolved, the people's cheers will not be limited to mere flattery!</p>

<p>United Press, Kubyshev, 14th: Frontline reports state that yesterday, Hitler mobilized powerful mechanized and infantry units, preparing to attack the central front again, attempting to break free from the winter's constraints on the German army.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th: German forces are desperately attacking Moscow but have made no progress. On the contrary, German forces on both sides of this line have been forced to retreat. German forces on the southern front before Rostov have also made no advances. Although the Soviet side admits the situation in the Kerch port of the Crimean Peninsula is serious, recent Soviet news reports that German forces at that port and Sevastopol have been contained. It is reported that Soviet troops have recaptured two villages from German mechanized units seeking weak points in front of the Moscow defense line. A large contingent of German troops has been surrounded in Volokolamsk, 75 miles from the Soviet capital. The German side claims to have occupied several coastal artillery positions south of Kerch, but Soviet news reports that German attempts to attack the Soviet flank in this area have failed. Furthermore, according to Soviet dispatches, tens of thousands of German soldiers have died in the Crimean battles. The German side has ordered the governments of occupied countries to add hospitals to accommodate the wounded. Hospitals are currently being prepared in Yugoslavia to accommodate 30,000 wounded German soldiers. Moscow Radio reports that Soviet Sturmovik dive bombers are now using new-type bombs to bomb German tanks. These bombs explode inside the tanks with a loud bang, like bursting balloons. The wreckage of tanks litters the roadside. Huitong News Agency, Berlin, 14th: Military officials here announced yesterday afternoon that Soviet troops first bombarded the central positions of the eastern front with artillery the day before yesterday, and then launched a fierce counteroffensive under the cover of tanks. As a result, they were heavily damaged and repelled by our army. Reuters, London, 14th: The Air Ministry's information office announced last night that hundreds of British Hurricane aircraft are now concentrated in various units on the Soviet front awaiting battle. British Air Force personnel who have flown to the Soviet Union have instructed Soviet pilots in the firepower and combat endurance of the Hurricane fighters, which are highly admired by Soviet pilots.</p>
<p>British Hurricane Aircraft Assembled on Soviet Front Awaiting Battle</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 14th: On the 13th, our army fought fiercely with the enemy on all fronts throughout the day. Thirty-six enemy aircraft were shot down on the 11th (previous report of 25 aircraft was inaccurate). Twenty enemy aircraft were shot down on the 12th; our side lost five aircraft. Two enemy aircraft were also shot down near Moscow on the 13th. From November 5th to 10th, our navy sank two enemy transport ships in the Barents Sea, totaling 9,000 tons. We also sank three enemy transport ships in the Baltic Sea, totaling 3,000 tons. On the 12th, our aircraft destroyed 47 enemy tanks, 11 armored vehicles, 300 military vehicles, and 119 artillery pieces, and annihilated a regiment of enemy officers and soldiers. Our Black Sea Air Force also destroyed 48 German aircraft, 110 freight cars, and many other enemy war materials.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 14th: TASS reports that on Wednesday, during the day and night, several German aircraft penetrated the Moscow defense line, sneaked into the city, and dropped bombs indiscriminately. Non-military targets were hit and exploded, causing some deaths and injuries.</p>
<p>German 16th Panzer Division on Eastern Front Heavily Damaged</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th: According to last night's news, there is reason to believe that 16 of the 19 divisions of the German Panzer Army on the eastern front have been heavily damaged, and more than 70 infantry divisions, including motorized and cavalry divisions, have also suffered heavy casualties, with some losing more than half their strength. It has now been confirmed that several German infantry regiments have been repeatedly heavily damaged, and their strength has been reduced to one-third.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 14th: Lieutenant General Kosin wrote an article entitled "Defending Leningrad," stating that the Battle of Leningrad has been going on for more than four months. The German command has assembled large contingents of tanks, motorized units, and infantry, dreaming of capturing Leningrad as soon as possible, but the enemy's blitzkrieg plan has failed. Everyone knows that Hitler and his generals have repeatedly set dates for the capture of Leningrad, the most recent being October 15th, but these plans have been shattered by the courageous resistance of the people and soldiers of Leningrad. In four months of fighting, the Germans have suffered 216,000 casualties on the Leningrad front, including 361 generals. According to preliminary statistics, the Germans have lost 759 artillery pieces, 679 tanks, 145 armored vehicles, 647 motorcycles, 1,568 machine guns, 506 small artillery pieces, and 1,681 freight cars in the fighting at Leningrad. In four months, the Germans have lost 1,484 aircraft in air battles, destroyed on airfields, or shot down by anti-aircraft guns. German forces in most areas of the front have been forced to adopt a defensive posture due to attacks by the Red Army. The courageous counterattacks and activity of our army have inflicted heavy losses on the enemy and forced them to retreat from their positions. Hitler, due to heavy losses, had to transfer troops from other areas of the front to Leningrad. As a result, the 39th Army Corps was transferred from Smolensk to this area. The enemy is currently taking various steps to assemble troops for an offensive. They are setting up strong fortresses, laying landmines, and densely wiring barbed wire, bringing more military equipment into battle, attempting to intimidate the people of Leningrad. Fascist aircraft rush into the city's airspace, bombing peaceful homes, and German long-range artillery bombard the streets, but nothing can intimidate them. The enemy has never set foot on the streets of Leningrad, and they will never be able to do so in the future. No matter what difficulties we encounter, we will never give up Leningrad.</p>
<h3 id="e24">British House of Commons Continues to Debate the War Situation; Several Members Urge the Government to Adopt a Strong Attitude Toward Japan <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th: During yesterday's continued debate on the war situation in the House of Commons, several members urged the government to adopt a strong attitude toward Japan. Conservative MP Lunn demanded that the government make a firm announcement that if Japan continues its aggression, it will immediately provoke an attack. He believes that if the government makes this announcement, there will be no aggression at all. Conservative MP Campbell welcomed Churchill's recent statement on Japan, saying that the Japanese are like the Germans, and they know nothing but plain language and force. I believe that the British and American governments will not accept Japan's apologies for its misdeeds in the future. In my opinion, the value of Japan's apologies is not even worth the paper on which they are written.</p>
<p>Labour Party Advocates Sending Troops to Aid the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Labour MP Griffiths spoke on behalf of the Labour Party, refuting the claim that the British government has not made every effort to aid the Soviet Union. It is said that all records have shown from the beginning that the government has a great desire to aid the Soviet Union. I can say to Hitler and his gang that attacking the Soviet Union has deepened and strengthened the determination of our people. The enemy must understand that we are united and determined to wage war until we achieve final victory. Britain will never be defeated. Independent MP Hopkinson, after reviewing the situation of American labor, said that in terms of production capacity, Britain should base its plans on the assumption that the enemy has even greater output. Labour MP Saxton said that in addition to providing equipment to aid the Soviet Union, it would be a very good gesture to help with some troops. Socialist MP Plett was dissatisfied with the continued presence of certain elements in the government. It is said that people who think like me all understand and firmly support the Prime Minister, as long as the Prime Minister continues to lead the government and fight alongside the Soviet Union to seek progress. Labour MP Shinwell, who is extremely critical of the government, said that our determination to destroy Hitlerism has not weakened, and our unity remains extremely strong. Does the government recognize the defense of the eastern part of the British Empire as the first front? We are eager to hear about this. If so, has it been approved by the Soviet government? Why has the British offensive in Libya been delayed until now? If the answer is a lack of equipment, then it is futile to talk about offensives elsewhere. Coordination is still lacking, and everything is being used sparingly, except for deeply entrenched interests. Although the Labour Party participates in the government, it is not involved in this. Shinwell also said that everyone knows that the government has inadequacies. The government must be stable, but the government's shortcoming is that it is too stable and never takes action.</p>
<p>Secretary of the Navy Responds on Behalf of the Government</p>
<p>Secretary of the Navy Alexander responded on behalf of the government, saying that the general trend of the members' remarks shows that the House still has great trust in the government and its administration. Under the leadership of the Prime Minister and the work of the assistants chosen by the Prime Minister, we have safely passed through major difficulties and dangers in the most dangerous 18 months in the history of the British Empire. The government should at least receive a vote of confidence for its accomplishments, as well as the constructive suggestions made by the members of the House who faithfully support our war efforts. The Secretary of the Navy continued, saying that the convoy system is extremely perfect. Comparing the work of maritime convoys, he believes that the number of ships lost in convoys is satisfactory. The high number of ship losses in the early stages of the war was due to the severe air raids on Greece and Crete, which had nothing to do with the ordinary convoy system. Since January of this year, Britain's imports have not decreased but have gradually increased.</p>

<p>Import Association Chairman Kerrigan Hosted City's Press Yesterday</p>
<p>Encouraged by the joint actions taken by the authorities of the two concessions, the Chinese and foreign residents of this city now expect general prices to fall next week. Officials also expressed their satisfaction with the results achieved in their efforts to control prices, and hoped that the high prices, especially the prices of coal, flour, and cooking oil, would fall sharply next week.</p>
<p>Japanese Statement Supports Control</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai recently issued an official statement, saying that the Japanese authorities are now fully supporting the control measures adopted by the two concessions, and have instructed the Japanese consulates and police to cooperate in investigating the increase in prices. However, prices in Hongkou are mostly calculated in Japanese military scrip, so some difficulties must first be overcome before the situation can improve significantly. It is also learned that Mr. Little, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, has returned to Shanghai after successfully negotiating the allocation of foreign exchange to the Shanghai Municipal Council in Hong Kong, and will arrive in port on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>Secondary Items are Complex in Nature</p>
<p>Mr. Kerrigan, Chairman of the Shanghai Merchants and Manufacturers Association, hosted the city's press at 2:15 p.m. yesterday in the Shanghai Municipal Council's meeting room, explaining the association's organizational structure and working policy. A written statement was also distributed by the Shanghai Municipal Council's information office as follows: "In the past week, newspapers have reported on the organization of an association of importers and manufacturers to assist the Shanghai Municipal Council in controlling the retail prices of household necessities. The Shanghai Municipal Council has already taken strict and most welcome measures regarding rice. It is now hoped that the Council will extend this approach to other bulk goods. This is a difficult task, and the Council will not be able to handle various secondary items, at least for some time. Although these items are closely related to the daily lives of ordinary foreigners and middle-class Chinese, the sheer variety and complexity of their nature do not allow them to be handled in the same way as the rice market. The various measures taken by the Council will be implemented in cooperation with the French Concession authorities.</p>
<p>The Basic Principle is Price Limits</p>
<p>The Importers Association is now actively organizing to assist the Shanghai Municipal Council in controlling secondary items. The basic principle is that members will inform the Shanghai Municipal Council, through the association, of the retail prices they consider reasonable, and the Council will then announce them as official prices that cannot be exceeded. If there are violations, the Council will punish them according to the powers granted by the new supplementary rules. At the same time, the association will also assist the Council in refusing to continue to supply goods operated by any member to those who violate the rules. It has now been agreed with the French Concession Public Works Bureau that the prices proposed by the association can be accepted by the Public Works Bureau as official prices within the French Concession. In order to assist members in obtaining reasonable prices and even distribution of imports, the association plans to seek the cooperation of the Exchange Equalisation Fund Committee, shipping companies, and commercial officials from various countries. It is believed that this cooperation can be achieved in various items that are important to social welfare.</p>
<p>Food and Medicines Managed First</p>
<p>The association's efforts are currently focused on items sold by foreign food companies and pharmacies. As for daily necessities such as kerosene, wool, cloth, and clothing, these are not sold much by these two industries. These items are also important and must be handled within a reasonable period of time, but in general, they cannot receive the association's efforts as immediately as food, medicines, and similar household items can. A considerable number of companies have written to Beikewei &amp; Co. at the request of the Shanghai Municipal Council, expressing their willingness to join the association. The association is still actively recruiting more members, so that the association can have the greatest possible strength. The association has now established several temporary committees at the Council's urgent request, including a general committee, a publicity committee, a retail committee, and several committees for pharmacies and foreign food industries. The retail committee has drafted a plan to set up a retail store. These temporary committees will be replaced by formally elected committees in the future.</p>
<p>Rationing and Direct Retail</p>
<p>Based on experience, any control agency, whether it is a single import firm or a group like the Shanghai Municipal Council, can control prices more easily if it can supply goods itself and sell them on the market at official prices. The association is prepared to undertake retail work for members who cannot retail if necessary. Suitable premises have now been found, and there is considerable financial backing. In the future, those who go to purchase goods will be given a form of identification card, and rationing will often be adopted to prevent users from hoarding and prevent merchants from purchasing.</p>
<p>Bulk Goods Should be Broken Up</p>
<p>It is hoped that existing retailers will fully cooperate with the authorities to establish reasonable levels for the prices of daily necessities. Thus, there is no need to set up special distribution points under the management of the association. In addition to maintaining official prices (which should give a reasonable business profit), retailers are asked to handle rationing and limit sales to regular customers as much as possible. At the same time, only meet the customer's current needs for goods. If possible, the containers of goods should be opened or the labels removed to prevent resale. In many cases, importers will retrieve old labels before distributing equal amounts of new goods. This may cause some inconvenience to the public, but it should be known that those who feel inconvenienced are generally those who purchase goods for hoarding or resale. Therefore, once the public understands this situation, they should not object. The association has also sent letters to applicants for membership, asking them to state the current wholesale prices and the retail prices they consider reasonable. In addition, please estimate and attach the amount of foreign exchange required for each listed item, so that the case can be submitted to the Exchange Equalisation Fund Committee for approval of foreign exchange allocation.</p>
<p>Maintaining Normal Imports is the Primary Need</p>
<p>The relevant subcommittees will select the items they consider most important and provide retail prices to the Council for publication. In order to understand the general supply situation, the association may ask its members to report the amount of inventory they own and the amount of inventory that merchants own. The association's initial goal was to manage prices for the benefit of the entire society. In the current situation, it has gradually proven that the association can contribute the most help in ensuring an adequate and normal supply of goods and obtaining a reasonable amount of foreign exchange. This may eventually become its main task. If normal imports of goods can be established, the price problem can be easily solved. What has been said here is only an outline of the association's policy. Importers, manufacturers, and retailers who want more detailed information can write to Beikewei &amp; Co. for inquiries.</p>

<p>The procedure for British nationals to register with the British Consulate General for evacuation will close this afternoon. Therefore, many British nationals decided yesterday whether to evacuate. Since this evacuation warning was issued on October 31st, many British women hesitated and went to the British Consulate to inquire about official advice. Consulate officials answered them separately. Now, many of these British women have registered.</p>

<p>The two concessions recently issued notices stating that, starting from the 15th of this month, the transportation of flour in quantities of more than one bag is prohibited in the International Settlement, or from the International Settlement (except to the French Concession), unless a special permit is first obtained from the Price Control Office of this Bureau.

Flour transported without a permit may be confiscated on the spot by the police. Permits for the French Concession are issued by the Price Management Office on Rue Chévalier, with a handling fee of two jiao per bag.</p>

<h3 id="e29">Grain Association Meeting Today; Discussing Collective Purchasing; Approximately 800,000 Bags of Rice Registered; Shop Owner Sentenced for Cheating Customers <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>After the Bean, Rice, and Grain Association began registering rice reserves on the 13th, although it was announced that the registration would close on the same day, there were still registrations being made until yesterday. The association did not complete its work until 6 p.m. last night. The association's representative, Yang Heqing, reported everything to He Dequi, the Shanghai Municipal Council's representative, that evening. The association also scheduled a third joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at its office on Avenue Edward VII this morning at 10 a.m., and invited members of the Rice Market Management Committee to attend. The main agenda item is to discuss how to proceed with collective purchasing. The registration of rice reserves at the wharves and warehouses organized by the Shanghai Municipal Council's General Office also closed last night. According to an estimate by a rice industry leader, the total from both locations is approximately 800,000 bags.</p>
<p>Grain Merchants Resale Abolished</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the Liji Foreign Firm had previously allowed grain merchants to order洋米(foreign rice) from the Shanghai Municipal Council and wholesale it to rice shops. Now that the authorities have established direct ordering points for various groups and manufacturers, rice shops can directly purchase from Liji without the need for grain merchants to resell. Therefore, the method of grain merchants ordering foreign rice has been abolished, and the rice payments collected from various grain merchants have all been returned yesterday.</p>
<p>Two Rice Shop Owners Sentenced</p>
<p>On the morning of the 6th of this month, when the Yixing Rice Shop at 518 Baker Road was selling平價米(affordable rice), there was an overwhelming rush of buyers. The shop owner, Qian Jiqian (42 years old, Shanghai native), actually packed several bags of平價米into flour bags, claiming to have pre-ordered them for relatives and friends, and refused to sell them. He was seen by a patrolling police officer, who advised him to sell them. The shop owner then used a weight that was less than the statutory weight (the five-sheng斗(measuring device) was one合(unit of measurement)short), cheating the public. This was also discovered by the police officer, who reported it to the police station to test the measuring instrument. Therefore, he was prosecuted for the crime of counterfeiting weights and measures. The case was concluded yesterday morning by Judge Zhu Chuzhe of the Special First Court in Criminal Court No. 8. Qian Jiqian was sentenced to six months in prison for fraud, and the five-sheng斗(measuring device) was confiscated. Wan Chunyuan (28 years old, Pudong native), the owner of the Heshungong Rice Shop at 565 Chengdu Road, also used a scale that was one jin short for every forty jin, defrauding the public. At 11 a.m. on the 6th of this month, he was discovered by the Xinzha Police Station. Yesterday morning, the police station prosecuted Wan Chunyuan in the First Special Court for the crime of counterfeiting weights and measures under Article 208, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code. After Judge Zhu Chuzhe concluded the trial in Criminal Court No. 8, Wan Chunyuan was sentenced to four months in prison for fraud, and the evidence was confiscated.</p>
<p>Handling Major Rice Sale Cases</p>
<p>A major meeting on rice management was held in the Shanghai Municipal Council's meeting room at 6 p.m. the day before yesterday to handle major rice sale cases. Those present included Fang Dekang, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice Management Committee, Secretary-General Boslai, Bellaire, Director of the Political and Economic Section of the French Concession, Inspector Monong of the Police Department, and rice industry committee members Qu Zhenhua, Fu Qiangeng, and Yang Heqing. The meeting did not end until late at night. The major rice sale cases were handled as follows:</p>
<p>* If a rice shop has no rice for sale but refuses to accept the foreign rice distributed by the Shanghai Municipal Council, anyone can report it as an informant.</p>
<p>* If a rice shop has registered rice but does not sell it according to the Shanghai Municipal Council's order, the Council can buy it at any time. The maximum price for the highest quality foreign rice is 120 yuan per shi, 115 yuan per shi for No. 2 Saigon Xiaojiao, and 90 yuan per shi for broken rice.</p>
<p>* Retail points will be limited to selling broken rice.</p>
<p>* The Management Committee refused to accept the wholesalers' request for considerable profit.</p>

<p>In order to implement the current ban on imports and to vigorously promote a policy of thrift, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the "Measures for Banning the Sale of Prohibited Imported Goods" on September 1. It stipulated that all designated items for which sales are to be banned, such as foreign liquor, cigars, perfumes, manicure sets, pipes, tobacco pouches, lighters, various ashtrays, toys, balloons, makeup, and clove powder, are all luxury and non-essential goods that should be banned from import. Sales of these items must cease after a three-month grace period, and private hoarding is prohibited. As the three-month deadline is approaching at the end of November, a special order has been issued to handle the matter in accordance with the ban. If anyone is found to be privately pledging, hoarding, or transferring these goods after the deadline, they will be confiscated. The confiscated items will be handed over to the Trade Commission or a designated agency for safekeeping and reported to the Ministry for disposal. A percentage of the proceeds will be used as rewards for those who seize the smuggled goods, with 30% going to informants, 20% to personnel from the investigating agency, and 10% to personnel from the assisting agency, with the remaining portion turned over to the national treasury.</p>

<p>The Hong Zhang Textile and Dyeing Factory Co., Ltd., located at 18, Lane 170, Tianjin Road, with the factory located at 381 Medhurst Road, experienced a labor dispute yesterday at 6:30 PM. Factory workers, citing the high cost of living and inadequate wages, demanded a wage increase from management. Negotiations failed to produce results, leading to a stalemate and a brief clash. Fearing further incidents, the factory reported the situation to the police, who dispatched a large number of detectives in two police cars to suppress the unrest. Simultaneously, Chinese and Western detectives searched the surrounding area. Reportedly, the police presence remained until around 9:00 PM. Labor and management are currently continuing negotiations.</p>

<p>Since American ships ceased operating on the Pacific route, direct transportation between Shanghai and the U.S. has been halted. Currently, transportation relies on transit through the Shanghai-Philippines route. For the Shanghai-non-US route, only ships from the Java Mail Steamship Company and the French Mail Steamship Company are operating. The Java Company's "Chibadak" arrived in Shanghai this Monday and is scheduled to return to Surabaya today, stopping at Hong Kong, Luzon, and various ports in Southeast Asia. Over one hundred passengers from Shanghai bound for the U.S. will take this ship to the Philippines and then transfer to a President Liner to return to the U.S. Next Friday, the French ship "Saint Pilatus" will depart directly from Shanghai to Luzon, bypassing Hong Kong. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow from Haiphong, carrying a large quantity of coal and over 4,000 tons of cement. The ship originally sailed between Shanghai and Haiphong, without stopping in Southeast Asia. Now, to facilitate travel for passengers bound for the Philippines, the ship will be rerouted through the Philippines on its return trip to Vietnam. As for the previous report that two American President Lines ships would arrive in Shanghai in mid-month, the company had no confirmed information as of yesterday. Therefore, it is uncertain whether any American ships will arrive in port this month.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Two Major Fires in the French Concession Yesterday Morning; One Woman Injured While Escaping <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Given the dry weather, fires are frequently reported in Shanghai. The authorities in the concessions have repeatedly urged residents to be careful with fire to avoid the unnecessary sacrifice of life and property and have strictly prohibited the hoarding of dangerous goods to prevent fires. However, the authorities' exhortations have been disregarded, leading to continuous fire incidents. Yesterday morning, two major fires occurred in the French Concession in quick succession. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Rue du Consulat</p>
<p>At 8:30 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the barber shop opened by Wang Zhaofu at 838 Rue du Consulat, French Concession. The flames quickly spread and became uncontrollable. Upon receiving the report, the Central Fire Brigade rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire after about two hours. In addition to the destruction of No. 838, the fire spread to six buildings including the Wan Kang Electrical Company opened by Xu Jinlin at No. 840, the white lead and leather shop of Wu Zengcai at No. 842, a ham shop established by Zhao Zhenhua at Nos. 844 and 846, and the residences of the Xia family at Nos. 848 and 850. The damage was extensive. During the fire, a local woman, Wu Zhengshi (54 years old), a resident of the second floor of No. 842, was seriously injured in the head when she jumped from the building to escape. She was taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Route Tenant de la Tour</p>
<p>Also, at 7:33 AM, a fire unexpectedly broke out at the home of Shen Jinbao, a local resident who made a living selling gardenias at 70, Lane 195, Route Tenant de la Tour. The flames immediately broke through the roof and spread to neighboring houses. Fortunately, all residents were already awake in the early morning, so they quickly fled their homes carrying suitcases and luggage, and no one was injured. The fire was extinguished by the fire brigade at around 9:00 AM. In addition to the complete destruction of Shen's home, five other houses were completely destroyed: No. 67, Huang Bingquan's residence; Nos. 68 and 69, the single-story residence of Sheng Shiliang; No. 71, Zhong Arong's residence; and No. 72, Xu Xiaomei's residence. The damage was also very significant.</p>

<p>At approximately 3:00 AM yesterday morning, Japanese personnel, accompanied by detectives from the French Concession police, arrested two fashionable women, Yang Zhen and Qiu Shujing, both around 20 years old, from Room 54 of the Russian Apartment on Avenue Road.

<h3 id="e42">Man Run Over and Killed <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>At approximately 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, a No. 2 public bus, registration number 15106, belonging to a British company, was speeding east when it struck a pedestrian traveling south at the intersection of Avenue Foch and Rue Petain.

<h3 id="e45">Hoarding of Dangerous Goods Discovered; Offenders Punished Separately; Police and Fire Departments Strictly Investigated and Confiscated a Large Quantity of Fuel; Offenders Tried and Fined <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The Fire Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, in light of the recent frequent fires within the Settlement, investigated the root cause and determined that it was mainly due to the large-scale hoarding of goods for profit by those who disregarded the danger. This was especially true for dangerous goods such as kerosene, matches, candles, etc. The places where these goods were hoarded were mostly simple houses with no fire-fighting equipment. Once a fire broke out, it was impossible to control. Therefore, if strict investigation was not carried out, the consequences would be unimaginable. Consequently, a joint effort was made with the police authorities to carry out strict enforcement. Recently, Chief Detective Liao Zhonggan and Deputy Chief Detective Ji Ronggui of the General Police Department, together with senior Western officials from the Fire Department, discovered that:</p>
<p>Shen Dehua, the owner of the Qian Tai Xin store at 439-443 Szechuen Road, was storing 1,000 cans of kerosene, totaling 5,000 gallons, and 100 boxes of matches, totaling 120,000 boxes.</p>
<p>Chen Changxiong, the owner of the Shanghai Yixin store at 7, Lane 262, North Chekiang Road, was storing 140 boxes of matches, totaling 168,000 boxes.</p>
<p>Chen Chengxu, the owner of the Chen Baochang Tobacco Shop at 347 Foochow Road, was storing 2,150 gallons of kerosene.</p>
<p>Qiu Ruhao, the owner of the Wan Chang Tobacco Shop at 346 Canton Road, was storing 1,500 gallons of kerosene.</p>
<p>Wu Quanxing, at 32, Lane 1081, Haining Road, was storing dangerous goods, all exceeding the prescribed quantity, which violated the regulations. Therefore, yesterday morning, they requested the Special District Court to issue arrest warrants and brought the responsible persons to the Ninth Criminal Court. Judge Shen Shanzeng questioned them one by one and sentenced Shen Dehua and Chen Changxiong to a fine of 300 yuan each and ordered them to send the total amount exceeding the quantity allowed for storage by the Shanghai Municipal Council to a warehouse for storage within five days from today. Chen Chengxu (the offender) was fined 300 yuan and ordered to send the excess kerosene to a warehouse for storage within one week. If he failed to comply within the deadline, the part of his business that sells kerosene would be ordered to close down. Qiu Ruhao was fined 200 yuan and Wu Quanxing was fined 150 yuan.</p>

<p>Recently, Chinese Chief Detective Jin Mianceng and Western Chief Detective Fernandaz, who was in charge of weights and measures, of the Bubbling Well Police Station, discovered that the rice measuring containers used by the Yixing Rice Shop at 518 Bubbling Well Road were deliberately made convex at the bottom to reduce the amount of rice sold. Their weighing scales were also not up to standard. They also discovered that the weighing scales used by the Heshun Rice Shop at 565 Chengdu Road were short by one catty for every fifty catties, which was a way of shortchanging the common people in order to line their own pockets. They reported this to the First Special District Court and requested the issuance of arrest warrants. Yesterday morning, the owner of the Yixing Rice Shop, Qian Jiqian, and the owner of the Heshun Rice Shop, Wan Chunwu, were brought to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Peng Qixin prosecuted them for fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Code and for using weights and measures that violated regulations under Article 208, requesting that they be severely punished according to the law. After questioning by Judge Zhu Chuzhe, Qian Jiqian was sentenced to six months imprisonment and Wan Chunwu was sentenced to four months imprisonment as a warning. Their substandard measuring instruments were confiscated.</p>

<p>At 9:15 PM last night, a white-label car (number 13113) was parked at the intersection of Bubbling Well Road and Park Road when two gangsters suddenly approached the car. One of the gangsters pulled out a gun and threatened the driver, intending to hijack the car. The driver shouted for help, and nearby Chinese police officers heard the call and rushed to the scene.

<p>According to a Berlin telegram received from private sources yesterday, Mr. Wang Linggen, a Chinese educator who studied in Germany, passed away in Berlin on September 29 of this year due to stomach cancer. He was buried locally on October 4. All of Mr. Wang's belongings are being kept by Mr. Shi Gaogen (transliteration), a current student in Berlin. Mr. Wang's friends were saddened by the news and expressed their condolences. Mr. Wang was from Dongtai, Jiangsu Province. He graduated from Shanghai Guanghua University in 1928 and served as a teacher in a Nanjing middle school. Later, he was invited by Mr. Zhu Jingnong to work for the Hunan Department of Education for approximately ten years. In the spring of 1937, he went to Germany at his own expense to specialize in educational psychology for further studies. Later, due to financial difficulties, he had to work part-time to support his studies. Chen Jie, the ambassador to Germany, greatly appreciated Mr. Wang and hired him to work at the Chinese Embassy in Germany, relying heavily on his expertise. In July of this year, China and Germany severed diplomatic relations, and the embassy was evacuated. Mr. Wang was unable to leave due to illness. In August, he sent a letter to a friend in Shanghai, stating that he hoped to recover in September and return to China via the United States. Unexpectedly, the German Consulate in Shanghai forwarded a telegram from Berlin to his friend in Shanghai yesterday, reporting the sad news of Mr. Wang's death. The sudden loss of a talented individual has caused grief among his friends.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Public Bonds Show a Rapidly Advancing Trend; Most Foreign Stocks Are Settled on the Same Day <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial market for public bonds continued to be good, showing a rapidly advancing trend. The Overseas Chinese Bank did not continue to purchase, while Rundehao consistently sold. There were a large number of retail investors entering the market with ten thousand or twenty thousand yuan. Various firms were also very enthusiastic about covering short positions. The market price has surged by four yuan to four yuan several cents in the past two days. Category C is almost approaching 70 yuan. There were many sellers, mostly bulls taking advantage of the high prices to exit the market. There were fewer short sellers. The short position platform has been transformed into a bull position platform. However, the upward trend is too sharp, and a reaction should be guarded against. Yesterday morning, Category C opened above eight yuan. Yitai, Jiufeng, Dechang, Dingkang, and Yizhong bought in, while Xiexing, Yuanlianyi, Runde, and Tongkang sold. The noon closing was almost one yuan better than the previous day. In the afternoon, Shengsheng, Dajiufeng, Tongkang, and Lianhe bought in, while Runde continued to sell. Dingkang and Yitai exited the market. Category C and E were raised to above nine yuan, and Category B also broke through the 70 yuan mark. The rise in prices is entirely due to the over-crowded short positions. Now, it has been transformed into an over-crowded bull position. As a result, the market prices continued to surge by as much as 5.5 cents to 1.75 yuan. The transaction volume was approximately 3 million yuan. A brief summary is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 200 shares of World Book Company new shares were traded at a price of 4.9 yuan per share.</p>
<p>The stock market at the Public Association opened slightly higher, but selling pressure soon reappeared, and prices fell sharply. Although the market rebounded due to short covering, it was only fleeting and then declined again. This was because liquidity remained strong, and many floating bulls were unwilling to hold positions overnight, resulting in frantic cutting of positions. Defeng closed at a low price of 177 yuan, and the rest also suffered a severe decline.</p>
<p>London, 13th (Thursday) Telegraph: The market prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks remained flat today. Only the HSBC British Registered Stock continued to fall by one pound, priced at 78 pounds. There were no other changes.</p>

<p>Yesterday's cash gold market, both official and unofficial, fluctuated and rebounded. The price has been pushed above the 21,000 yuan mark. The recently stabilized morale of all parties was stimulated by the buying pressure. The banking group again began a large-scale search for gold, and the securities group Defu frantically bought in 3,930 taels throughout the day. Dafeng also bought in more than 2,000 taels. Although Xianghe, Chengji, and Yifeng showed good intentions to sell, and other firms also mostly sold, they still could not resist the buying pressure. The price rose from 19,800 yuan to a high price of 21,200 yuan, and finally rebounded by 1,150 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 23,700 taels. Gold ornaments also rose by 120 yuan, reaching 1,140 yuan. The black market price of refined silver rebounded, reaching 27 yuan.</p>
<p>Cash Reached 10,000 Yuan Again</p>
<p>The market opened at 9 AM with 19,900 yuan per bar (ten taels), a decrease of 50 yuan. Defu, Xiangxing, and Yongli bought in, raising the price to 10,050 yuan. Shihe, Xianghe, and Chengji sold, lowering the price by 250 yuan to 19,800 yuan. Soon after, amid the buying pressure from Defu and Dafeng, Tianyuan, Yongcheng, and Hengji also competed to buy, soaring by 400 yuan to 20,200 yuan. Xianghe sold forcefully, but Xiangxing and Yongfu reappeared, lowering the price slightly to 19,850 yuan. Tianyuan and Decheng Defu bought in, and seeing Xianghe suddenly raise its price and buy in again, the price soared to a high price of 20,300 yuan, which was suppressed by Chengji's forceful selling. The noon closing was 20,250 yuan. After the closing, Defu sold 20,200 yuan. The market opened at 2 PM, down 150 yuan, priced at 20,100 yuan. Suddenly, Dafeng, Defu, Xianghe, Shunyuan, and Decheng poured in, and the price soared by 550 yuan, reaching 20,650 yuan. Yongcheng, Xianghe, and Tianyuan sold forcefully, suppressing the price to 20,380 yuan. Seeing Tianyuan buy in again and Dafeng buying again, amid the rising trend, the market price was soared even further by Defu's frantic buying, rising by 820 yuan, reaching 21,200 yuan. The closing price at 4 PM was 21,100 yuan, rebounding by 1,150 yuan compared to the previous day. After the closing, there were merchants selling at 20,900 yuan. The difference between the highest and lowest prices on the day was 1,300 yuan. The retail price of gold bars at gold shops was 21,200 yuan, with the purchase price being about 1,000 yuan lower than the selling price.</p>
<p>Gold Ornaments Rose by 120 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of gold ornaments per tael at Dayihang and Xintonghang was raised by 40 yuan in the morning and another 80 yuan in the afternoon, reaching 1,140 yuan (purchase price reduced by 150 yuan), a rise of 120 yuan.

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw both the Central Bank and HSBC posting flat prices. The prices at the 14 smaller HSBC counters were even more stable. The Stabilization Fund even allowed these foreign banks to freely absorb foreign exchange at a fixed price (5.375 yuan), without necessarily having to resell it to the Central Bank. However, regarding the small amount of remaining unfrozen and circulating foreign exchange in the city, it is strictly forbidden to transfer it to import firms that are not allowed to apply for it. In the future, Chinese long positions and export firms will have no way out except to sell to the Central Bank and the 14 foreign banks at 5.375 yuan. However, some import and export firms in the city that deal in so-called non-essential goods have contacted import and export firms in the United States. After the goods are exchanged, the import firms in this city will settle with the export firms in legal tender, and the export firms in the United States will receive the US dollars from the import firms. Yesterday morning, a certain Chinese broker offered to sell the above-mentioned US dollar position at three yuan, but failed to find a buyer. It is even more difficult to sell the US dollars withdrawn at 37 yuan. The afternoon continued in the long trend. At the 4 PM closing, the British exchange rate was 2 and 625, and the US dollar was 3.125 yuan. Because banks are not allowed to transfer funds, there were no takers, up 625 from the British long and 125 from the American long compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the prices of British and American gold notes rise by 20 yuan along with the cash price. The remaining British notes were relatively stable, and the market price was flat. Due to the urgent situation in Japan, the price of US dollar notes fell to 35.2 yuan in the afternoon, but finally settled at 36 yuan, a drop of 1.5 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes tended to fall by one cent. Japanese gold notes continued to fall, retreating to 3.4 yuan in the evening market. Korean notes were in balanced supply and demand, and the market price was flat, remaining at 3.6 yuan in the evening market.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Spun Yarn Is Cashed Out on the Market; Shuangma Collapses From Now On; Inherent Phenomena After Price Controls <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market's momentum has turned weak, and the falling trend is gradually emerging. This is because the 工部局's recent price controls have caused hoarders to feel apprehensive. At the same time, the Far East situation is tense, and spot yarn transactions have long been banned. Therefore, the bulls' goods are being cashed out on the Shuangma market, causing market instability. However, some say that the factory's costs are still high, but sales are stagnant. The hoarders are spitting out goods, thus lowering the market price. The high price of 20-count Shuangma factory singles was 2,745 yuan, and the low price was 2,605 yuan. The opening price in the afternoon was 2,680 yuan, falling to 2,595 yuan. The closing price rebounded to 2,638 yuan. The outside market did business at 2,655 yuan to 60 yuan. The swap bulls posted more than four yuan.</p>
<p>Shuangma opened strong in the morning, with the first market price at 2,715 yuan, a rebound of 25 yuan. Shortly after, the price rose to 1,745 yuan. Soon after, the exchange price was weak, and the market situation turned soft. At the same time, spot transactions were suspended, and buyers were uninterested, and they all aimed to cash out, and the market situation fell step by step to 2,605 yuan. Subsequently, the profitable shorts covered their positions, and the fork rose to 2,658 yuan. It is reported that the transaction statistics in the morning were 3,200 bales.</p>
<p>Golden Shuangma Futures Market Situation continued the momentum of stagnation, and the falling trend still did not stop. There are still many bad news reports, especially the sluggish sales of spot yarn miscellaneous brands, which has caused the inventory to increase day by day. The problem of their future goods is the most concern for general long positions. Therefore, many are eager to sell out as soon as possible and drop the others. Moreover, the gold market was also weak first, resulting in the collapse of the yarn market. In the morning, the opening price of the November period was 2,520 yuan, a good 20 yuan. The December period was 2,560 yuan, which was quite unsustainable due to the dumping of gold and securities, and fell by 45 yuan. January was 2,650 yuan, a drop of more than 105 yuan. After entering, although it once saw a slight rebound of more than ten yuan, it was ultimately indifferent by many parties and was completely controlled by the seller. Therefore, the lower reaches, the recent low to 2,410 yuan, December fell to 2,530 yuan, and January was small to a low of 2,595 yuan. In the afternoon, more empty watches, and retail investors rarely entered the market, and the market was up and down. Only the recent period also had a difference of 100 yuan, while the distant period was stable, only fluctuating between 30 and 50 yuan. As a result, November was 2,425 yuan, and the closing continued to be 75 yuan. December was 2,565 yuan, and the closing also fell by 90 yuan. January was 2,650 yuan at the close, a drop of more than 105 yuan. The list is shown below:</p>

<p>The current cotton situation is very weak. Because of the yarn slump, the daily yarn falling trend is intensifying. Factory transactions have completely stopped, so the market has fallen by dozens of yuan. The future still needs to be seen loosely.

<p>Factory Cloth Yesterday's market, because the rumors became more and more complicated, the holders cut prices to get rid of them, and the selling market continued to soften. However, the gold price rose sharply in the later market, and the East Piece rose sharply. Because the market has little influence, white goods fell by 2.5 yuan to 5 yuan, and bleached and dyed cloth was mediocre. Transactions on this street are becoming weaker, because the decline is due to the decline.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth The exchange period cloth, because the shorts used rumors to add leverage and suppress it, the falling trend is still strong. Each month continued to fall by 4.19 yuan to 5.8 yuan per piece, so the leader of the spot market, Xibu, also fell sharply. The lowest price was 86 yuan, but the guest gang and colleagues took advantage of the cheap price, which was a lot. Therefore, after a short period of time, the price suddenly rose by 4 yuan to 90 yuan, and the closing price fell by 3 yuan compared with the previous day's market price. The Sijunzi叽叽 once plummeted to 3.19 yuan, and then rebounded to about 3.4 yuan. The market has stabilized.</p>

<p>Soon after the price of flour was controlled and priced by the rice market, people were unusually afraid. The Golden Dragon brand was sold in small quantities by the actual sales office on this street, priced at 40 yuan. Later, the owner shouted 40 yuan, but there were no buyers. The future is still small, because it is feared that foreign flour will also be controlled at a low price. No one accepted wheat bran. There were 56,700 bags of wheat in stock, which were all handled by Japanese factories, and the price was still 75 yuan, it is said.</p>

<p>If a man is physically weak and has no hope of regaining his health, he will feel that the whole world has turned gray, envy other people's happiness, and feel boundless sorrow in his heart! At this time, even a charming wife and beautiful concubines are not enough to comfort his mood; even the children in swaddling clothes, he will still pin his hopes on them, but the weak husband is difficult to have children, so he floats in the air, and then dissipates in an instant!</p>
<p>The body of a man should be as strong as a dragon and a tiger, with rich thoughts and full of energy, and strive to be a stable force in the family, a pillar of society and the country. But why is the body weak, to this point? According to medical judgments, most of them must be due to early self-pollution, seminal discharge, or early marriage and indulgence, which depleted the life-giving reproductive gland fluid. Then, weakness of the brain, poor memory, insomnia, palpitations, sore waist and back, kidney atrophy and premature ejaculation, incomplete development, premature aging and other symptoms are not uncommon. Thus, the appearance is dry, the ambition is depressed, and the energy is lost all day long in sexual life, making the happiness that life should enjoy often like a phantom, or even completely unable to perform, wasting one's own and his wife's precious youth. This is really helpless for men, but how can the wife be willing to endure it? Therefore, tragedies such as elopement, suicide, and divorce between couples are often staged in the general society. The untimely death of the husband, leaving behind orphans and widows, is even more tragic!</p>
<p>Today's medicine is prosperous, science is omnipotent, and physical weakness can be strengthened by tonifying. The above-mentioned symptoms have even more special effects: What is the special effect? It is the reproductive gland supplement therapy invented by the world's medical saint Dr. Stanah after more than 30 years of hard experience. The method extracts the reproductive gland hormones from the bodies of strong animals such as orangutans, apes, bears, deer, and sea dogs, and uses a concentrated replication method to make them into tablets. In simple terms, it is the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproson." It is the most nourishing internal medicine preparation. After taking it, patients can produce essence, tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood circulation, and nourish the nerves in one day and night. Continuous use can help develop and adjust metabolism. It must be possible to cure all symptoms radically in a short period of time. Regular use can also achieve the effect of prolonging life and rejuvenation. Only those with seminal emission need to take "Himmeltot's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to stop it, which will be more effective! Since the prosperity of endocrine medicine, most Chinese and foreign doctors have adopted this method, and they all believe it is the most effective. I have used this method to cure tens of thousands of patients. Recently, Mr. Hu Yihua suffered from severe brain weakness and kidney deficiency, combined with seminal emission. He took supplements on the market, but they were like throwing stones into the water, with little effect. Last month, Mr. Hu came to the clinic for treatment. After observing his symptoms, I instructed him to purchase half a dozen "Reproson" and three boxes of "Himmeltot's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" at the Zhongxi Pharmacy, and instructed him to take both. In less than a month, it was found that all diseases had suddenly disappeared, and the energy was abundant. Not only was the efficiency of handling affairs doubled, but the love between husband and wife was also boundless!</p>

<p>Although it is said: "Three points of talent, seven points of dressing," but "a goose head on a duck's neck" is not very well matched after all. A thin girl, with breasts shrunken and painful like an undeveloped child, with no beautiful lines revealed in her figure, and a face withered or pale without any ruddy complexion. This kind of girl, even if she wears 静绮 silk and satin and is full of rouge, will only add to her inferiority. Because men of the times have long placed emphasis on healthy beauty in their aesthetic concepts of women. Therefore, the beauty of women is entirely based on health. If a woman's breasts are well-developed, it can prove that her reproductive function is sound, and there is no disorder of menstruation, leucorrhea, or insensitivity. Therefore, naturally, the blood is full, the body is slender, the face is ruddy and lovely, and the temperament is pleasant and lively. If this kind of girl wears fashionable clothes again, even without makeup, she feels beautiful and moving. Men who see this kind of woman will regard her as an angel in their hearts. There are those who praise from the side, and those who are determined to pursue her will definitely fall under her pomegranate skirt. If a good marriage is made, once married to a satisfactory husband, the love after marriage will inevitably be continuous, the children born will be smart, the family will be organized happily, and life will be so happy! However, why do many women have breast cancer and decay? This is mostly due to hidden diseases, which cause the reproductive function to become unhealthy. Any woman who wants to turn weakness into strength and ugliness into beauty must cultivate her reproductive function and eradicate her hidden diseases. The gynecological sacred medicine recognized by world-renowned doctors, the reproductive preparation "Reproson" for women, is the most appropriate medicine for the above-mentioned needs. After taking it, women can regulate the menstrual cycle and stop leucorrhea, and cultivate the reproductive function. If they continue to take it, they will surely be able to eradicate various hidden diseases, make the breasts stand up, the cheeks rosy, and enhance health and beauty. Based on my years of experience, I have used this preparation and obtained satisfactory results for tens of thousands of people.</p>
<h3 id="e76">The Only Cure for Nocturnal Emission Patients <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>"A momentary slip can cause eternal regret," but in today's era of all-powerful science, it is no longer entirely suitable to say that there is no way to remedy the matter of "shooting the door." However, "slipping up" always carries considerable danger, and it is best not to slip up at all. It is true that young people have weak wills and insufficient reason, and are easily tempted by adverse environments. Therefore, young people must be cautious in making friends, must not read obscene books or paintings, and should especially not frequent low-level entertainment venues. Because these places are most likely to arouse lust, and when lust is strong, not achieving one's goal can lead to the bad habit of self-abuse, or countless cases of homosexual love. You should know that self-indulgence or unreasonable sexual behavior such as early marriage and licentiousness is most likely to damage the sexual nerves, relax the seminal vesicle, and erupt into the terrible condition of nocturnal emission!</p>
<p>Although nocturnal emission is common among every unmarried young man, some may experience it once or twice a month or every few months due to excessive accumulation of semen produced physiologically. This is a physiological overflowing of semen in healthy men due to late marriage or long separation from their wives, and it does not harm their health at all after the overflow. However, if nocturnal emissions occur more than two or three times within a month, and one feels mentally exhausted and drowsy after the emission, this is undoubtedly a pathological nocturnal emission. Those with this symptom must be treated as soon as possible to avoid serious harm. If treatment is delayed, the mild symptom of wet dreams may progress to the severe symptoms of spermatorrhea and seminal leakage. There are also many cases where prolonged nocturnal emission leads to depletion of essence and blood, resulting in brain decay, insomnia, poor memory, chaotic dreams, daytime fatigue, back pain, kidney atrophy, premature aging, and incomplete development. How can such young people continue their studies or concentrate on their careers? Unmarried individuals will inevitably be rejected by the opposite sex, and married individuals will be hated by their wives. Thus, the future becomes bleak and happiness is lost! Nocturnal emission is not an incurable disease, so why misunderstand oneself and others to such an extent! Regarding the treatment of nocturnal emission, according to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking "Schmidt's Semen-Consolidating Tablets" is the only effective treatment. This medicine can strengthen the seminal vesicle and calm the nerves, and it has a miraculous effect of promoting sleep and stopping nocturnal emissions on the same night after taking it. If the nocturnal emission has already caused the aforementioned symptoms, continue to take "Reproductive Essence" to nourish the brain, kidneys, essence, blood, and nerves, and you will surely be completely cured within a short period of time. If you can come to this clinic for combined electrotherapy and injections, the effect will be even faster!</p>

<h3 id="e77">New Discovery for Treating Tuberculosis <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Dian De</p>
<p>Hoping that citizens pay attention to common knowledge of tuberculosis treatment</p>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) has become a social disease in China. Taking Shanghai as an example, under harsh sunlight, air, and nutritional conditions, I don't know how many millions of citizens are eking out a miserable existence under this terrible disease. In a recent physical examination of freshmen at a certain medical school, a third of the young people were found to have fairly serious tuberculosis symptoms. From this one example, the rest can be inferred.</p>
<p>The terror of tuberculosis lies not only in its widespread transmission, but also in the fact that even in today's era of advanced medicine, there is no good cure that can heal it in one fell swoop, causing patients to linger for life or recuperate for years, losing the joy of life and the ability to compete for a living. As for those who die without treatment and cannot afford the "rich man's disease" treatment expenses, they are even more pitiful. Tuberculosis varies in nature depending on the location of the infection, so traditional Chinese medicine has the saying "seventy-two tuberculosis," while Western medicine divides it into pulmonary, intestinal, bone, urinary, skin, and eye tuberculosis, etc., depending on the affected area. Although the treatments differ, the main methods still involve lifestyle methods such as sunlight, air, and nutrition, seeking to increase the patient's resistance and self-heal. From this, it can be seen that almost all parts of human life have the opportunity to contract tuberculosis, and the cure must be delayed for days, costing money, and even carrying the risk of death. How terrible is tuberculosis!</p>
<p>In recent years, methods for treating tuberculosis have been changing with each passing day and have made great progress. Surgical treatments such as pneumothorax, rib resection, and lesion resection can promote early healing for lung, kidney, and surgical tuberculosis. Various emerging chemical and blood transfusion therapies can also occasionally be effective, but either the organs are incomplete after recovery, or the efficacy is not obvious, and continued research is still needed. Now, as a result of research by medical experts in various countries, a new discovery has been made, and that is the optical therapy with unlimited prospects!</p>
<p>In the past, there were also methods of treating tuberculosis with sunlight lamps (containing ultraviolet rays) and natural sunbathing, which served as an important treatment for bone tuberculosis, etc., but this is different from the new therapy being discussed today.</p>
<p>Anyone who has taken ordinary physics knows that there is a type of deep X-ray, which is an invisible ultra-shortwave light produced by passing high voltage through a vacuum. The penetrating power of this light is deeper than that of X-rays, and its destructive power to biological cells is also greater. In the past, this light has been used in medicine to destroy cells of tumors, cancers, etc., and to treat stubborn skin diseases, and it has been extremely effective. Now, after careful research, it has been found that this light has the effect of penetrating the human body to treat tuberculosis. Because its light wave vibration and impact are sufficient to destroy tuberculosis lesions, making it easier for new cells to recover. Since this light can penetrate the human body, it can reach any depth and destroy any resistance. Now, this new invention is being experimented and researched in the new medical field around the world. Although its report has not yet been fully disclosed, it has become a firmly established, latest effective therapy.</p>
<p>There may be many people in our country engaged in this new research, but the author's knowledge is limited. I only know that research at the Shanghai Red Cross Hospital and Peking Union Medical College has achieved results, and there are not a few who have been cured. Here is a simple discussion of the treatment results I have recently heard and seen.</p>
<p>The research at Peking Union Medical College is limited to patients with early-stage bone tuberculosis and small lesions, and it has proven to be particularly effective. There are still many contraindications for patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. In other aspects, it has now been further proven that various surgical tuberculosis cases with small wounds and mild inflammation (such as arthritis) can be cured in about half a year after dozens of irradiations. However, the reaction to this treatment can sometimes be great in sensitive tuberculosis patients, such as loss of appetite, vomiting, increased pus, and even increased fever. Therefore, the method of administration still needs to be further studied, and it is currently only a preliminary exploration. But in any case, it can be asserted that this therapy definitely has a bright future.</p>
<p>Readers, pay attention to this important research. I hope that it can achieve satisfactory results soon. This is not only the obligation of experts, but also requires everyone's support! Zhong Xun</p>
<h3 id="e78">American Museum of Natural History <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Xun</p>
<p>There is a very famous natural history museum in America, which is very large in scale and has a wide range of collections. It includes all kinds of things in nature, such as humans, birds, beasts, fish, plants, and minerals, with complete specimens and detailed explanations.</p>
<p>Americans make great use of museums. Even many teenagers are there, surrounding several animal models, holding questions given to them by teachers, carefully observing and writing answers. These models are made lifelike and are provided for students to study. They are more realistic than real animals, because real animals may have slight discrepancies in their composition due to metabolism, while these models are typical representatives and are complete in all respects. American students can be considered fortunate. Their specimen room is not just a room inside the school, but a world-famous natural history museum.</p>
<p>Inside the natural history museum, there is also a planetarium. The so-called planetarium is actually moving the entire celestial body into the house. Its structure is a circular dome, with various celestial bodies arranged according to the actual situation of the sky. If it is a planet, a track is installed for it. Inside the dome, there are rows of chairs, with a lecturer in the middle and a complex machine set up.</p>
<p>During the lecture, all the lights in the room are turned off, and a little music is gently emitted. The guests sitting in the chairs will soon forget that they are sitting indoors, and feel like they are sitting in the courtyard enjoying the cool in early summer. Once the machine is turned on, various celestial bodies begin to move. After moving for a while, the lecturer explains the composition of each celestial body, its history, and their interrelationships in order, using both verbal explanations and performances with the celestial bodies on the dome. Suddenly a comet appears, then the Milky Way is projected in front of you, then a solar eclipse occurs, and a meteor falls to the ground. Then, the moon appears and the stars disappear. Soon, the current situation is explained, and the lecture covers the various changes in the celestial bodies that may occur in the coming year. Finally, the sound of a rooster crowing is heard from the radio, and the birds are chirping. The one-hour astronomy lecture ends in a situation where you do not feel tired at all.</p>
<p>Those who have studied astronomy or have been to an observatory to observe the stars have always had a vague impression. After listening to and watching this lecture, they can generally understand.</p>
<p>They actually use scientific methods to move the celestial bodies into the house to conduct their public education.</p>

<p>— Yong Da</p>
<p>In order to enhance national defense procedures, it has recently been suggested that in the event of an emergency, every car in the United States should be able to be immediately converted into a steel-armored car. The solution is to first create a tank-shaped shell with a half-inch thick steel armor, and quickly cover it on the car body in an emergency. Then, the steel-armored car can appear in an instant. However, this requires a standard car of a fixed size, otherwise, it would be very inconvenient if the car bodies were of different sizes. These steel-armored cars, when gathered together to repel invaders or paratroopers, can do a lot.</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Chapter Fourteen: Beating the Hero's Life</p>
<p>"Good! -- One more time, ...; good, ..." Applause and cheers unexpectedly drilled into his ears. He never expected that a few somersaulting insects would come on stage and people in Shanghai would cheer, and the cheers would be as loud as if the whole hall was cheering.</p>
<p>Because he felt strange in his heart, when the third person went out, he paid special attention to watching. This one happened to be a young and competitive fellow. He saw that the first two had won praise, so naturally he was unwilling to let others do the same. In addition, tonight they were instructed by Zhang Yincai, the head of the martial arts troupe, to deliberately embarrass Qiu Haitang. When he flipped, he put in even more effort. He flipped somersaults all the way, stopping near the stage entrance, at least sixteen or seventeen times. Following this, there was a burst of strange cries from the audience. The guy was so happy that he actually flipped a string along the edge of the stage, from right to left, with "Mandarin Duck diving into the water" connecting the turns. The fourth one who came out, of course, also flipped just as vigorously, making Qiu Haitang feel very regretful that he was too reckless and should not have mixed into the Red Stage to eat this bowl of martial arts rice without considering his own ability.</p>
<p>But he had already come, and the person had already reached the entrance to the stage, so he couldn't retreat temporarily!</p>
<p>Fortunately, he used to be with Zhao Yukun, and he flipped very well with tiger leaps. At that time, he became ruthless and gritted his teeth, flipping all the way out. In the first five or six flips, he flipped very quickly and roundly, almost like a windmill. There were also many people in the audience cheering. (263)</p>

<h3 id="e82">How to Solve the Inheritance Problem? <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Feng</p>
<p>Correct Answer in "Peach Blossom Lake"</p>
<p>In European and American films, we often see that when a wealthy person dies, they have already made a will, allocating each part of the inheritance, designating donations to hospitals, schools, libraries, or gifts to factories, farms, developing industry, agriculture, etc., and the children do not have any special benefits to enjoy. However, in China, due to the traditional concept of heredity, inheritance issues often lead to tragedies of property division, even leading to litigation. Recently, after Luo Jialing's death, the inheritance of 700 million yuan has been making headlines.</p>
<p>Regarding this complex and multifaceted inheritance problem, Jin Xing's new work "Peach Blossom Lake" points out a correct answer, which is to use the inheritance to promote social undertakings, build farms, and seek public welfare, with labor and management cooperating sincerely. This not only solidifies the individual's career and status, but also heralds the improvement of the social system.</p>
<p>Although "Peach Blossom Lake" is Zheng Zhengqiu's posthumous work, its subject matter is realistic and also suitable for the current era. The film has also been decided to be shown at the Jincheng Grand Theater starting next Wednesday. The cast includes Hu Feng, Shushi, Chen Qi, Zhou Qi, You Guangzhao, Xu Xian, and Xu Zuowen. The director is Zheng Xiaoqiu, Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu's son-in-law, so it happens to be an inheritance, but this belongs to the field of film art.</p>

<p>— Yi Tong</p>
<p>Wedding to be held on the 21st</p>
<p>Yan Jun and Mei Cun, two famous actors of the Shanghai Professional Troupe, fell in love in a flash and have now successfully completed their relationship. It has been decided that they will announce their marriage at the Henda Western Restaurant on the fifth floor of the Hadong Building on Nanjing Road at 5:00 pm on the 21st of this month, and a banquet will be held on the spot to entertain guests. There will definitely be a grand occasion at that time. It is said that when Yan Jun was in the Shanghai Drama and Art Society, he fell in love with Murong Wan'er, which attracted much attention at the time. Now that things have passed, Yan Jun and Murong Wan'er's romance has become a thing of the past, and it is impossible not to have a sense of the past and present.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Wax Figures of Stars <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Dao</p>
<p>There is a famous sculptor in Hollywood named Ms. Stubber, who specializes in sculpting dish-like figures for various movie stars to replace dangerous shots in film shooting. For example: In "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," there is a scene where Charles Laughton hugs Maureen O'Hara and walks on the iron tower of the cathedral. In fact, what Charles Laughton was holding was just a wax figure sculpted by Ms. Stubber for Maureen O'Hara, while the real Maureen O'Hara was sitting on the ground watching.</p>
<p>Ms. Stubber's sculpture is a four-generation family tradition, so her art is very exquisite. The wax figures are so lifelike that almost no one can see the flaws. Last year, when filming "Gone With the Wind," all the disabled and wounded soldiers lying in a train station were wax figures sculpted by Ms. Stuber. One night, a thief broke into her sculpture studio, saw the wax figures on display, suspected they were real people, and quickly slipped away.</p>
<p>When Ms. Stubber was fourteen years old, she sculpted a full-body statue for Lionel Barrymore. According to her, among movie stars, Garbo's wax figure is the easiest to sculpt, and Clark Gable's statue is the most difficult to sculpt. Once, a businessman in Los Angeles was willing to pay 310 US dollars to her for Clark Gable's wax figure, but she was unwilling to part with it. Her recent work is a wax figure of Hedy Lamarr.</p>

<p>Cheng Yanqiu repeatedly contributed "Daughter's Heart" and "Wrong Lin Qiu," which caused the entire "Head Spring" play to be unable to be performed. It is now learned that Cheng still has a few days to stay before returning north.</p>
<p>Wang Hongfu, who is currently affiliated with Da Chan Zhi's Sheng, has decided to transfer to Gong Wu Qun. Mao Yunke will no longer join. Liu Hanchen has retained the chairmanship.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that Ao Jilan will change to performing spoken drama. He will still join the troupe, sing, and act, and has compiled the script for the play "Bai Jie Jiaren".</p>
<p>Hua Shan Xin Guiqiu and Wusheng Wang Shaolou have married and will hold their wedding ceremony on an auspicious day.</p>
<p>Li Shaochun will perform at Tianchan, the ticket prices have been renegotiated, and they will also be sold for twelve yuan.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 19: Dusk, Nomad Cavalry, Dust Fills the City</p>
<p>When Liu Yinyin heard this, he glanced at Xu Jing's face and slowly said, "Brother Jing is truly my confidant. If it weren't for Brother Jing here, I would have left long ago. The heroes and heroes of ancient and modern times value resolute decision-making. Once they have identified a goal, they devote all their efforts to it, and no setbacks or pressures can move them. Then they can establish great ambitions and achieve great things. Therefore, I want to advise Brother Jing to decide on his ambitions early, and then never waver due to external circumstances. There are many people in the world whose original intentions are very good, but later they change their original intentions, and even do things that completely contradict what they did before. What is the reason for this? I am afraid that it is because his will is not firm and he wavers. Therefore, Master Mencius said, "Hold your will and don't be violent with your qi." For example, General Wu originally wanted to serve the king, but later he softened for a while; for a while, he vowed to punish the thieves because Li Tuan had taken his beautiful concubine; for a while, he was afraid of the power of the rebels and begged the Qing court for help, borrowing external forces to help him quell the rebellion. Brother Jing, think about it, people with such an unstable will are not only unable to accomplish great things, but I am afraid that they will not have a good outcome in the future. What are we doing under his command? Are we going to serve the barbarians with him?" Xu Jing was greatly admired after hearing Liu Yinyin speak so generously and enthusiastically. So he said, "I know what you mean, my dear brother. Now we can only delay for a while. If Wu Sangui can handle it well, then naturally there is nothing to say. (129)</p>
