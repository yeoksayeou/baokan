<h3>不斷暴騰中之物價</h3>
<p>此一週來，上海市塲之紛亂騷動，無改於疇昔，只見物價之飛騰暴漲，投機之勢燄猖厥，生活之每况愈下，一市之中漲起千百元，一日之間變動十餘决，見其升未見其降，見其進未見其出，直視法幣若無物，遂有此畸形怪態、豈可以常理相繩耶！</p>
<p>上海雖已遠離戰事之範圍，猶未脫戰時之氣氛，故仍受戰事動作之牽掣。交易之小易得其平、亦豈易得其準。又處於無管束之狀態下，魑魅魍魎，一時並作，買空賣空紛然雜陳，詖詞易爲聽，大利易爲動，操縱屯積，聯接而來，事實上所不能無。但欲保持社會之安寗·終須維持生活之安定；今日一般生活之不安定，至矣極矣，朝所入，夕不能謀一飽，貨物充牣而堅持不肯售，良以貨價之升漲太速，只進不退，屯貨雖有波折，只須稍假時日，莫不如願以償，此所以越屯越多，即物價所以欲平難平也。</p>
<p>夫欲平物價，賴有實力；實力者，行政上之實力與經濟上之實力耳！行政上之實力，即爲有管制市塲之實際上權力，但辦法不容有例外，處置不容有分歧，反乎此者則糾正之，懲戒之。然行政上之實力有時而窮；况管制市場，亦非盡可以權力完成之，甚至為行使權力，轉使管制之成效未見，而弊竇百出，為所挾制，故必佐以經濟上之實力，如工部局當初之限制米價不能見效，而公賣能收一部分維持民食之功也。</p>
<p>若謂管制物價，只須從零售，而有問躉售，則如屯積居奇不出，是吾將行使行政上之權力而干涉之乎？不然，則無異於使方寸之木，高於岑樓也。要知今日物價所以昂貴至此，非盡爲零售商之居奇，實爲投機奸商大戶屯積與居間商之作祟，若果有正本淸源之計，則對於期現市塲宜採取實際上有效之步驟。有如烚赤之買賣，其本身固無預於日用各品；而其上漲、亦非爲外滙有若何之變動，徒以少數人突患黃金毒，乘此半數以上之金條在窖藏中，市上流通籌碼缺乏之際，大暈搜羅，不嫌其貴，不以爲多，懷貨者安得不奇貨自居，四五百條之成交數，動輒上漲千數百元，昨日竟見一萬八千九百元之高價。又如雙馬棉紗，實銷並無動靜，織廠方多减工，然而紗價奔騰，竟無日不漲停板，亦無日不有新高價。各業見獵心喜，不問銷路如何，存貨多寡，來源旺衰，亦以抬價爲能。如是乃直接威脅及於大衆生活矣；米麵油豆之漲，衣着雜物之貴，燭皂烟紙之昂，房租婪索之甚，皆爲少數而牽動大局也明甚。</p>
<p>外匯之是吾供給，再黑匯之放任如故，亦皆爲物價不易安定之主因。、外匯如果照常供給，則如何供給，應有明文；如不復供給，則及早揭曉，亦復何患。最可痛心者舉棋小定，猶豫不決，謠詠繁興。　心虛慌，有似留此空罅，不爲投機奸商造機會，即爲有資力者作逃避之餘地。如對於正常需要品，仍照常供給以外匯，則對於所供給之商品、宜按週公布，俾大衆有咸知之必要，無爲買賣商人乾沒而去。其價格，應由進口商與各該業在其應得合理之利潤下，秉公厘定，遵此以爲門售價格，不得稍有增減。其貨物，由批發商或代辦商直接支配於零售業，不得再用棧單或期貨路貨等名目，在市塲流轉買賣，供操縱居積之用。批發商應儘量與消費者謀作直接交易，但不妨從其售量上稍加限制。即行家對於批發或行紀業支配貨物，亦應根據其本街實銷數作比例，不得任其獨攬承銷，爲所壟斷，有如近日各業之行動，公賣之物，其同類之商品，不問公私所有，宜在同一種評價銷售之組織下出售，俾品質價格歸於畫一，物貴不以次貨混售，庶不至採辦上發生障碍，對消費者喪失信用。又須具有普及於直接消費者之妥善方法，不以貿販及製造者爲對象，上次平價粉之出售，徒利於居間之當業中人及以貿販爲生之小販，眞正之消費者，反有無從購致之嘆。</p>
<p>英美商人，旣因其政府之勸吿，犧牲一時之小利，與中國平準會謀合作，而合作焉者，要須精誠的合作，無貌合而神離。凡不必需之商品，雖利益優厚，而不爲承銷；出口貨物之外匯，仍得結於平準會；黑滙市之取銷，務致其最大之努力；橫在當前之困難，應共同將其尅服。且以滬上所殷求之生活必需品，若米若麵，及其他洋貨，近皆仰給於香港。今香港之物價，並未大變，而港滬間之匯價，則爲黑滙頻頻告緊，高低懸殊；若得保持原有之關係，改善今日之滙價，或可稍紓滬市生活之困，並以搆成經濟上之民洽陣綫，應付目前，策及將來，固爲切要之圖也。</p>
<p>歐戰叢談</p>
<h3>法國人的苦悶</h3>
<p>這篇是法國名記者特薩爾He　Sales所作，原文載美國「大西洋月刊」，茲　錄如下，於此可見戰敗　餘後法國人的苦悶情形：</p>
<p>做法國人含有什麽意思？直至一年以前，我決未想到這一個問題，正像我不會自問何以生而有兩手兩足一樣。</p>
<p>我生長在法國，受敎育也在法國。我的一生，大半住在法國。我曾旅行各地，於法國形勢，知之甚詳，我愛法國的富有變化，各省情形不同，氣候互異。當我遠游歸來之日，眞覺一見如故，無論空氣，光錢，田野，樹木，城市，村落，都給我一個極熟的印象，正如攬鏡自照，看見我自己的面龐一般。那時我並沒有向自己說：「這是法國，我是一個法國人。」像這樣明顯的事情，當然不用提起。但是我一看見敎堂的尖塔，或是兩邊種着白楊的馬路，或是嘗到麵包的滋味，這種親切感覺的無限複雜性，重又證明我自有生以來即與地球上這一個特殊地方的無意的結台。</p>
<p>我也知道和我生在同一時代的法國入，並歷代以來生於是，長於是，工作於是，死亡於是，而使我們得有今日的數千百萬法國人，這個民族，昔日會經做過許多大事，產生過不少偉人，今後當然能繼續奮起，盡他們建設文明的一部份責任</p>
<p>我也知道我們的過失，而為之煩悶不安。我喜讀史登台爾（法國文學家倍爾的筆名）的文字，他誠意以爲他不歡喜法國人，說他們華而不實，實則他自己亦何嘗不是極度的這樣呢。</p>
<p>我不知道我是否爲一愛國者，我甚至不知道我是否爲一善良的法國人。我從來沒有問過我自己。在我初生的三十年中，我更注意於文學，美術，音樂，而不甚注意於政治。及至政治（這是廣義的政治），成爲我主要事業的時候，我也並沒有想到和我意見相同者是善良的法國人，和我意見相左者便不及他們的善良。在我看來，似乎做法國人的一個最優點，即有與他人意見不同的自由。</p>
<p>總之，我在幾個月前對於這問題的感想，就我記憶所及，自覺我生而爲人，和偶然的生而爲法國人在此兩種意識之間，從未發生過何種衝突，法國對於我似乎有一定的價値，而此價値又這樣的普遍，這樣的廣博，這樣的近情，定以使人耐心經歷許多戰事，許多革命，和許多才能出衆的法國人意見紛爭擾攘不已。</p>
<p>我從未想到法國是可以被毀的。我現在並不相信，可是我今日作此言　，不得不加以註釋。第一，我不知道法國用什麽力法，或須經過何種輪迥，才能再表現她的活潑精神。第二，我不知道法國的再生，是吾會在我有生之日，或須待至三五十年或百年之後。最後，此事如在不遠的將來即可實現，我不知道能吾認識或瞭解道再生的徵象。其間或有不少虛妄的企圖，以期重建法國，我不知道我能吾不墮入這種陷阱，或是誤入歧途。</p>
<p>假使這是我一個人或少數人所遭遇的事，除了我們自己之外，當然無關緊要。可是這個患難，殆爲我們全體所要遭遇的，殆爲現在法國掙扎於失望，悲愁，困厄的暗影中的四千萬人民所要共同遭遇的。</p>
<p>法國已失去一切了，在這一次戰敗中，每個法國人，和法國的本身，殆已受到一個教命的重創，那班爲了各種不同的原因而欲向自己，向他人證明這不是一個絕對失敗的人，未免蒙着良心，自欺欺人，當我說法國已失去一切，或遭受致命重創的時候，我是爲現在這一代人而說的。我很知道年靑的人，前途還有新的生命。他們或者可以從瓦礫堆中重新建設起來，但在今日，祇有一堆瓦礫而已。這就是現實。</p>
<p>我常在報紙中看到法國的新地圖，被淪陷區和非淪陷區的界綫劃分着，眞覺創鉅痛深，有觸目傷心之感。一幅地圖原係抽象的，可是這條界綫，却是一種超越性的現實，因爲表示着國家的被肢辨。這不是我們確定的國境綫，而是戰勝者的任意處分。今天如此，明天便可以另攀花樣。這條界綫，穿過河流，道路和鐵路。因爲有這一條界綫，法國的血液，便不能在體內循環。而且肢解的結果，不僅影響人民的物質生活，兼可影響到他們的道德和心理關係。家庭有因此被分散的。法國縱有重行統一的可能，也將爲這條界綫所阻。住在南面的和住在北面的，彼此隔絕，有如中間橫亙着一條高壓電綫。這是納粹特殊形式的殘暴，常帶着虐淫在的色彩。這道界綫，不啻把法國劃分爲兩個集中營，其唯一不同之點，僅爲一個由德國人直接統治，一個於法國人的幻覺上以爲仍在自已保護之下而已。</p>
<p>講到法國生活的紊亂情形，可不必過於辭費。報紙的記戰，和旅行家的談話，已早有詳盡的叙述了，所奇怪的是，素以豐富，安舒，高雅爲主要特徵的一個國家，其生活狀况竟會一落千丈，下降得如是之速。我知道法國有一個思想學派，以爲今日所受的慘禍，因人民生活安舒而養成柔弱之風，亦是原因之一，貝當尤帥似即屬於此派。寗取牛油而不取槍砲，誠不免缺乏深謀還慮，但我依然相信這並不是一種罪惡。法國常欲令每一個人都能盡量獲得完美的生活，她這種嘗試也曾得有不小成績。如用統計測量，則法國生活程度之高，尙還不及美國，但就其着遍性質而言，似已非仟何國家所及。至少外界是這樣的想。法國也以此爲世人所　道。</p>
<p>這種法國人生活的特殊性，現已變爲歷史陳跡了。今日的困苦艱難，可以重產生一種。的精神，這個假定，或者是不錯的。但有許多法國人，以爲我們現在所遭受的　罪有應得，　我看來，却是一種判斷的錯誤，由於失望太甚而來。這不啻是在說，法國人內爲太文明了，所以現在這受道種懲罰。若果如此，直無異承認納粹的學說。。世界上除了　力，沒有其他法度，殘暴是健全的行爲，除爲效能而維持效能，及組織一個機械的國家之外，別無他種目的。</p>
<p>可惜好多的法國人，甚至最優秀的法國人，也不免震於德國戰爭機構的威力，除了物質效能之外，不敢再作他想。講到德國戰爭器材的優越，和他們的善於運用，當然不成問題，因之迫得多數法國人想把他們的失敗成為合理化，依據癸式，如演算個一般。這種法國倫理，若努力加以應用，實在是理智作用中最危險的一事，法國人憑此能力，　成立了一連串現實主　的公式，用以說明他們過去所取途徑的無可避免，　規劃他們未來的進行。（未完）</p>

<h3>美變更援蘇路綫　與太平洋局勢無關　官方解釋此舉並非對日綏靖　運蘇軍需取道白海最為便捷</h3>
<p>路透社二十四日華盛頓電　美航務委員會所發運蘇貨物將一律由波士頓港運出之消息、已使國務院對於此項決定與太平洋日本局勢有關之說、予以切實否認、查本週初曾有禾設實之傳說據謂日本新政府已照會美國以後運蘇物品經過海參崴者將被截留、消息靈通方面謂、接濟蘇軍之最捷路錢乃由波士頓經大西洋北部與白海而至河堪遮（即亞爾干日爾）</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社二十二日華盛頓電　美航務委員會決定以波士頓港爲軍械運往蘇聯唯一港口之後、外傳此事與太平洋局勢有關、此說頃由國務院予以否認、又據羅斯福總統私人秘書歐萊向報界談稱、美國以物質接濟蘇聯必能按時運到、其數量亦必與美國代表團在莫斯科所提供之諾言相等、業經羅斯福總統聲明之矣、至于貨物須至何時及自何處起運、自無說明之必要云、查美國各報會載日方消息、謂日本政府對美國輪船載運軍械前往海參崴港者有意加以阻撓、因此美國爲避免美日兩國間發生意外事件起見、決定暫不利用海參崴港運輸軍械前往蘇聯云云、茲觀於國務院上述聲明、可知此項結論、顯屬謬誤、此在主管方面、亦謂美航務委員會之決議實另有原因、質言之、即加速以貨物運往莫斯科、倘自海參崴港運港須時十日、但自阿堪遮港運入、則僅須四十八小時即可到達、惟依照現行中立法第二條規定、美國商船不能駛往白海及阿堪遮港、故在此項條款水廢止之前、美國商船仍須懸掛外國國旗云、</p>
<p>路透社廿叫日倫教電　此間對於美航務委員會宜布運蘇貨物取道阿堪遮之消息、頗以爲異、昨日頗多探詢此事者、目前官方人士在未獲英國駐美大使館之情報前、雖保留批評、惟據泰晤士報外交訪員聲稱、該委會之作此決定、自有許多理由、東京方面以爲已獲知其理由之、實則非是查　近數月來、關於美國不得已而放棄原有路綫之議論、業已獲得不少之答覆、例如八月間當日本向美蘇提出交涉之時、兩國均答以通至海參崴之路綫仍將採用即其一也、美國雖不欲予日本以任何無意之激惹、但仕公私兩方面已明白表示將不犧牲蘇聯而對日讓步、該訪負又謂、在另一方面如該委員會之宜布果含有放棄海參崴爲美船駛往口岸之意義、則或與美日談話不無關係、但美國務院對此已力加否認矣、</p>

<h3>紗市白浪滔天　一日間成兩種局面　晨間漲停板…午後跌停板</h3>
<p>紗市形勢依然凶凶、且終日在猛進疾退中，市塲紊亂不堪、足使人心惶惶不可終日、完全爲黃金價所恐怖也、一般人不顧一切、金價跳、即拖進、反之則出、所以市面白浪滔天、二十支雙馬晨開、市上今日有大戶出來維持、可使得市盤穩定、不致於漲停板、首盤價爲二千四百七十五元、此時形勢帶軟、逐步回鬆至二千三百七十元、比開盤下落百元、然檯面轉緊、同時黃金盤盤報升、取引所布價橫跳、漲風驀地而起、某方雖竭力維持在二千四百九十元內售出、然買者儘叫高價收進、結果仍屬為二千四百九十元漲停板、暗盤已做到至二千五百二十元、造成恐怖局面、午後停市不能做、午後取引所紗布一致慘落、原因傳說謂有結價之謠、同時又有利空說素、金雙馬亦跌停板、又有人說黃金大落、浮多吐出、總之紗市紛亂不可收拾矣、查半日間成交統計一萬五千包、今日有日紗一百件運往烟臺、</p>
<p>金雙馬期貨劇漲在跌、起伏達二百元有餘、紗市此次暴升以來、連日劇升停板已達五决有奇、雖老多大戶不動、而浮戶絡續之進出仍多，刀頭之舐血、期紗追證後延至十時開盤、十一月走勢初軟、爲二二九〇元低盤開出、入後步昂頭盤做至二三六〇元、十二月開出爲二三七〇元、乃升至二四三〇元、一月份開出即吿停板、突猛升一百元之多，二盤做開、十一二兩月亦均停板午後以謠傳蠭起、廠單因無交、而期紗人心益見恐慌、浮多力加出籠、市價急轉直下、近遠期均跌停板、其一漲一跌之差、相達二百元之多、如此翻雲覆雨，市塲素亂、其趨勢益難逆料、茲列表於後、</p>
<h3>棉價早晚不同</h3>
<p>現棉情况、上午跟踪紗市而挺秀、午後因消消息不良、及黃金在瀉、氣勢帶餒矣、</p>

<p>蘭宮花一〇〇件五八·〇二又</p>
<p>又二〇〇件五七七·〇又</p>

<p>又一〇〇件五八〇·〇又</p>
<p>又二〇〇件五七二·〇又</p>
<p>火機草包五〇〇件五〇〇·〇又</p>
<p>紐約棉市、因有華盛頓政治消息報吿稱、參議會已經通過百分之一百的一九四二及一九四三新貸棉案而漲、投機者及南方幫買進、或空頭抵補、皆屬活躍猛烈、結果收盤價格，較之上日約漲二十七至五十磅音不等、</p>
<p>印度棉市、昨日爲銀行例假日、棉市休業，又預測今日開盤較上日看漲四羅比、</p>
<h3>米價後市更疲</h3>
<p>洋米早漲午跌、晚市更疲、早市承前日漲風、仍有盲從吸收與貨主抬價、投機幫鑒於金價再漲、更從而活躍、故小絞與二號西貢、均漲達一百五十七八元、一號西貢到一百七十三元半、但市價抵達最高價後，聞工部局平賣小絞已證實續有成交、且外匯尙有供給商貨與麵粉之舉、更有利空之謠、因此獲利多頭首先回出、大戶亦有趁高脫手、加之皮球幫趁風轉帆、市面頓見反動下跌、小紋一瀉八九元、午收已小至一百四十九元、午後更軟、仍在一百四十八九元間徘徊、而形勢則尙在看小中、成交共計不到二寓、英華司開小絞一百八十一元半至一百八十元零五角、計有三四百噸、目下各棧存底、共有九十八萬七千七百七十一包、比上期少六萬六千八百五十五包、</p>
<p>厚薄新破兩粳來源續稀、店銷平常，價繼增二三元、計開南港早破百八十三元至百八十元、崑山新粳百八十一元百八十元、靑角窰種及楓涇百哥均爲百八十元、野稻及杜尖乏貨無市、糯米仍以供不敷求，開香港白元百八十五六元、中關百八十三元至百八十元、糯菉百七十三元半百七十三元、又升一二元不等、</p>
<h3>洋粉運津不絕</h3>
<p>洋粉早市尙平、蓋公賣已勢在必行、且謠言利空、市面逐次見疲，午後因米價銳落、金價亦低、再被警吿，獲利者急於求脫、即大戶客囤亦復紛粉出籠、市乃立即反動下傾、砲臺早市開四十五元五六角、下午收市已小至四十四元半、金龍上午四十四元七角至四十四元半，下午則跌至四十三元三角、比之前市均猛瀉一元四五角、麩皮同時有囤戶售出而乏受主、前晚暗盤四十六元之價、已貶低二元求脫、</p>
<p>怡和洋行阜生輪、今日由滬赴天津、除由香港裝有洋麵粉二千九百包原船轉運天津外，在本市又加裝麵粉九千六百包赴津、（祖）</p>
<h3>油市猛進疾退</h3>
<p>昨日食油先漲後跌、初因棉紗黃金繼趨高漲、投機油儈仍然一味吸抬、價又上挺三五元嗣以日軍票突然止漲轉跌、及有利　謠傳、致人心驟衰、卒吿銳落、結果比上日反降七八元，統市售開大連豆油二百桶，靑島生油六十桶、又豆油四十桶、烟聽豆油一百聽、江北生油二百聽、大有廠淸油近千担、各廠菜油二千五百担、</p>
<h3>內債突起回風　－外債漲跌互見－</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市異常紊亂、造謠某種空氣、拉抬公債、同時幷傳中英經濟協定有已在香港簽定之說、一時檯面求過於供、丙種開盤即做七元三角、比隔日好二角，收盤時抬至八元外、驟好幾及一元、午後開盤亦定、又回小至七元一角半、入後穿出八元、竟又抬至九元、市價結果、一致大漲一元至一元八角不等、丙戊種本已價月相等、現又相差一元、成交總數共計的二百六七十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>倫敦二十三日（週四）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、漲跌互見、中國外債計中法美金五厘債票漲兩鎊、價爲四十七鎊、善後五厘借款（英發）跌一鎊半、價爲三十六鎊半、英克斯飛機借款升一鎊、價爲十一鎊、鐵路公債計北寗鐵路借款獨漲五鎊、價爲六十五鎊、道淸鐵路、借款跌一鎊、價十三鎊，英股匯豐銀行英倫註册股跌二鎊、價爲七十五鎊、開平煤礦不記名股跌一先令六便士、價爲十四先令、福公司上升一先令六便士，價爲二先令六便士、餘無變動、</p>

<h3>期糖復市　狂漲猛跌</h3>
<p>糖市期貨已開始復交、開價初漲後跌，上落甚鉅，竟達二十餘元之多、糖業本有糖君子之美譽，但自投機揷足後、君子地位、已蕩然無存矣、公司期貨二四粗白十月底期開盤二百五十元、收盤六十二元、最高六十七元、最低五十元、塲外交易六十二元、下午二百五十四元、開盤四十十二元、收盤最高五十四元、最低四十二元半、塲外交易四十元、十一月十日期開盤二百五十二元、收盤七十二元、最高同價最低五十二元、塲外交易七十二元、下午六十二元、開盤五上三元、收盤最高六十二元、最低五十二元、塲外五十元、現貨二四粗白劃盤十月份二百六上二元半·至四元·六元、下午六十八元·六十元·五十五元·四十六元、九月份二百五十三元·五十六元·六十元·六十五元、下午六十六元·六十二元·五十七元·四十五元、八月份二百五十四元半·五十九元·六十二元半·八十四元，下午六十五元·五十五元·四十二元、七月份二百五十三元·六十二元，下午六十五元·五十五元·四十二元、六月份二百五十元至六十元、下午五十六元·五十元·四十元、比前日價漲起十四元、但收盤反跌九元不一、荷赤二百三十四元半至四十元、下午三十三元·四十元·二十五元·二十元、最高比漲七元、最低反跌十三元、香港粗白二百二十八元·二十七元·三十一元·三十四元、下午三十五元·三十元·二十二元、反跌六元、太古車白B嘜二百六十八元、下午五十元、HHX嘜二百五十一元·五十三元、下午四十元、反小一二元、聞轉跌原因、又係某種空氣所致、故演變至烈也、</p>

<h3>法商電车電燈公司　昨宣佈核減電费　百物飛涨聲中獨樹楷模　為數雖微足資各業效法　管理物價案下週可批准</h3>
<p>關於管理本市物價一事、工部局依據特別會議之決議案、向領事團請求批准地皮章程新附則一條、俾授權該局、釐訂關於管理必需品零售價格之規章、以控制投機與漁利、茲據大中社記者探悉、現正由領袖領事希爾、徵求各國領事意見、日領堀內干城、業已表示同意、同時工部局亦已着手籌備、組織合法的管理機關、俾於獲得領團批准後、於下周公布管理物價辦法、付諸實施、</p>
<p>法租界內電費新章</p>
<p>本埠法租界法商電車電燈公司、自本月一日起、曾將界內水電車輛等收費酌量提高、但昨日該公司正式佈吿、自十一月一日起、將法租界內電燈電力收費减低百分之七至百分之十、俾其價格與沿用於八月一日至九月三十日間者相同、但水費·電車·無軌電車·暨公共汽車票價、則保持不動、自本月一日開始之價格、繼續有效、茲將電費新價格錄如下、（一）電燈費每度（KWH）由六角减至五角六分、（二）電熱由每度三角七分减至三角叫分、（三）電力裝置在十匹馬力以上者、每度由三角九分减至三角六分、（四）電力裝置在十匹馬力以下者、每度由三角八分减至三角五分、水費仍爲每度（三方公尺）三角四分、公共車輛之票價仍照現狀、按目下物價高漲聲中、法商水　公司仍能酌量减價、雖其數甚微、但其實行之精神、足爲他業法、希望其他各業、勿利慾薰心、不顧公衆利益、頻將物價抬高據可靠方面傳出消息、工部局向領團所提新附則之內容、大致分爲三項或四項、以當局所指定之必需品爲主體、（例如米與外麥）、而公定其零售最高價格、以防止投機與漁利、倘違反者爲華人時、即由工部局行使其權力、實行檢舉、移送第一特區法院、予以處分、並取消其營業執照、如違反者爲享有領判權之外人時、工部局依擄地皮章程附則、工部局於取消營業執照外、並得委託各國領事館予以懲處、工部局並將根據地皮章程新附則、制定罰則、對於任　抬高物價者、予以重懲、俾收抑平物價之效、</p>
<p>統制麺粉　單獨施行</p>
<p>據大中社記者探悉、現工部局已採取一新管理物價辦法、以按制麵粉價格、聞即將於數日內實行、昨日工部局發言人、對麵粉市塲情形、拒絕加以評論、但稱工部局已考慮統制麵粉運銷辦法、並聲明與管理米價辦法不同、聞此一計劃、係於一月前即有人建議、於本周內始決定付諸實施、工部局常局希望、由於此舉、可完全控制界內麵粉價格、惟該項計劃、係單獨施行、並不包括在管理其他物價之內</p>
<p>局方所請　終將批准</p>
<p>大陸報云、權威方面頃宣稱、領事團對於本週初工部局送達之管理物價建　、已在審愼考慮硏究中、雖各方未予證實、但局方相信領事團團員、均在思考在此種塲合、應予工部局多少權力、最初傳說該一建議數日內即可核准、但就目前情形言之、此事一星期後、可望批准、無論如何、領事團終將賦工部局以特權、管理物價、惟接受此一建議之技術程序、極爲複雜、領事團或將舉行一特別會議、對此事作最後之決定、關於工部局是否將說立一機關、實行新管埤物價政策、或由工部局直接管理一問題、亦同時決定、</p>
<p>領事法庭　尙須研究英文大美晚報云、負責人士頃吿記者稱、工部局向領事團所提獲權管理公共租界物價之要求、將有影響遠大之後果、故領事團各團員、必須透澈研究此事、若干領事或須呈報大使館或本國政府、然後始能答覆、無論如何、工部局擬定而提交領事團核准之附則、須經此間領署法庭加以硏究、以便確定其將否影響在華之條的權利、</p>
<p>零售商竟　限制售貨</p>

<h3>預擬駛滬之總統輪　臨時奉召折回　此次停航並非永久性質</h3>

<h3>上海的盜竊（下）</h3>
<p>— 百敏</p>
<p>匪徒偊爾也有携大批賊物，赴內地銷售的。警務處若接內地銷贓的消息，立派探員一名趕往，會同當地警員拘捕匪徒和收贓者。戰前匪徒常在虹口集會，行刦後，便過橋到虹口或閘北銷售贓物；滬戰爆發後，典當和收贓都遷來蘇州河南，銷贓中心地也隨之南移。</p>
<p>警方常用探員冒充收贓者一法，當塲捕獲銷贓的匪徒。冒充收贓者的探員進行工作時，先和接近匪徒活動的第三者的定接洽日期，匪徒如約到塲，便遭假扮工人，徘徊附近的其他探員拘獲；開審起來，匪無從抵賴，祗得招承，飽嘗鐵窗風味。不過，乖巧的匪徒，常防落這圈套，故先派代表，並不携贓，獨自到塲，探員無從下手，祇得虛與接洽，一面靜待時機成熟，祇等匪徒認爲安全無虞，而出示贓物，才動手將匪黨一網打盡。</p>
<p>有些匪徒的活動，頗有泰西匪黨的作風，常隸屬一個匪黨，假手第三者銷贓，成交後給予佣金。有時匪徒將贓物藏匿多月，以爲警方偵查已弛，才向收贓者或典富接洽銷贓；但多數仍被破案，因爲探員奉派偵查一案，始終留意，雖經多月甚至多年，仍能將匪徒捕獲，解案懲辦。</p>
<p>上海盜風日烈，與多數市民的漫不經心，也有關係，市民記得被刦財物的正確價値和詳細特點，以助警方進行偵查的，寥寥無幾。而被刦不報，也是刦案頻起的重要原因。公共租界警務處和法租界警務處的密切合作，偵緝匪徒，已獲良好成績，每遇刦案，祗須有充分綫索，不難在短期內破獲。</p>
<h3>雜糧交易所　昨又被擲兩彈　並未爆炸由捕房移去</h3>

<h3>暗殺白俄會主席　兇手被捕</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、聞日方已在南市拘獲一華人、抄出手槍一支、其式與暗殺本市白俄委員會前主席伊凡諾及近月來紅口方面行刺日兵所用之槍相同、此案現由日憲兵隊之林少佐、與公共租界警務處會同辦理、聞該被捕華人、係兩日前在南市圖刺某人、被附近日哨兵捕獲者、抄出之手槍與槍彈、與九月二十五日伊凡緒被刺七月間日哨兵西田遭暗殺兩案所檢獲之槍彈相同、衆信該被捕華人、對於恐怖活動、已有所招認、故料日方與公共租界當局不久或將施大規模之逮捕、</p>
<h3>霞飛路寳康里　兩婦被拘</h3>

<h3>自由談徵文揭曉之六　事非經過不知難  麟　　－我得了一個敎訓－　　在這米珠薪桂的時候，家裏勉强用了一個娘姨。除了買小菜燒飯之外，她還要洗五個人的衣服。這些事已足够她忙得透不過氣來，那裏還有暇去整理房間。於是，灰塵就有增無减的佈滿了我們的房間。天花板上張滿着蜘網，玻璃窗汚得幾乎透不過光來，牆上盡是一塊一塊的斑疤。我實在有些看不過了，自問難道這些事祇配娘姨做的嗎？我也有二只手，爲什麽不目己動手呢？好在現在是暑期，我有很多的時間可工作。好！決定自己做罷。　　我第一步預備粉刷天花板。於是，我便到街上去買了一包「牢粉」，用水調和，那裏曉得停了一回，「牢粉」很快的沈澱起來，水和粉很淸楚的隔離着。我知道這一定不是這樣簡單就可以成功的。於是就到「粉刷作塲」去詢問，才知道不加膠水是不行的，我就在那裹買了一些膠水。回家一試，果然靈騐。那水和粉很均勻的調和着，再也看不見什麽沈澱了。那時我高興得很，以爲一定能順利的進行了。誰知第一筆蘸着粉拭上去就出毛病。非但拭不白，甚至越拭越黑。原來我忘記將灰塵先拭去，那白粉遇到了灰塵當然白不起來了。無奈何，祇得冉上街去買了一把新掃帚，方將灰塵蜘絲等物刷凈。這次我不上當了，若用舊掃帚，豈非又加敷一層汚泥嗎？好容易，天花板粉刷完畢，可是已滿頭大汗。臉上身上好似都粉刷過一般，對鏡一照不禁哈哈大笑，原來活似個戲臺上的「小花臉」。這一次的成功，雖然受了些挫折。然而却引起我以後工作的興趣和勇氣。　　第二步，我預備揩玻璃窗和牆壁。看來似乎很容易，可是多時不揩的玻璃倒也使我然費心機。從梯子上爬上爬下的洗揩布，提着鉛桶一次一次的換水，一回兒用乾布，一回兒用濕布，忙得我不亦樂乎。費了九牛二虎之力才將五十八塊玻瑰一氣揩淸。　　第三步我預備漆地板，我跑到「漆匠店」中去討敎，要怎樣才能漆好？漆是怎樣做的？當然問的時候不能神氣活現，要虛心下氣才行。順利得很，那漆匠很客氣的都吿訴了我，敎我到漆店中去買些洋竿漆（固體），然後浸在火酒中，待其溶解後就行。我謝了一聲後便去買了四叫角錢洋竿漆，作爲試騐之用，回到家中，倒了些火油，將漆放在裹面。那知等了半天，那火油還是火油，漆還是漆，可恨的洋竿漆，竟絲毫無溶解的意思。我正是疑惑不解的當兒，父親走了過來，微嗔着道。。『狼狼藉藉的弄了一地。」祥叔父也過來說：『自己想漆地板，總歸弄不好。』我沒有話說，因爲我正在做的東西不靈啊！那時我並不想中止我的工作。我相信那和氣的漆匠決不會欺騙我的。於是我二次跑到漆匠店中去詢問不溶解的理由，經那漆匠指示後，我才恍然大悟，原來我把火酒誤用了火油，怪不得等煞不肯溶解了。眞寃枉。這一次我重整旗鼓，抱着必成之心，買足了原料，終於將我那間舊房間，粉刷得煥然一新。父親和祥叔父也都來看了。這時候他們沒有話了。　　從這一次的經騐，我得到了三個敎訓　　（一）不恥下問－我本來一些不懂的事情，問了人以後，就能自己做。一人的知識有限，萬不能自矜。必須虛心求敎，方能以他人之長，補自己之不足。　　（二）不屈不撓的精神－一件事情的成功並不是一次就行的，其中往往要經過多决的挫折。譬如孫中山先生的領導革命，到了第十次方纔成功，若是他在第一次第三次失敗後就停手不幹，甘心失敗，試問我們那有今日？所以不屈不　的精神是成功的一個大因素。　　（三）事非經過不知難－往往有許多事情看上去似乎很容易，可是自己做到後，才覺到有些辣手。我相信『事非經過不知難』這一句話。自然自然界的攻守法  孫閎　　現代戰爭中的許多攻守方法，實在不足爲奇，因爲自然之母早已替各種動物，想出了那些方法。　　大砲－有一種甲虫隨身帶着一尊大砲腹腹內的一種特殊臭腺。牠們開砲的時候，發出可怕的臭氣，而且有隆隆的砲聲。足使牠們的敵人－捕食生物爲生的爬行甲虫和鳥類，嚇得棄甲曳兵而走。　　防空網－據最近的報吿說：英國已發明了一種砲彈，那種砲彈爆發以後，能射出金屬的細絲，鈎住敵機的推進器。池塘內有一種原始動物，用同樣的方法，保護牠們自己。牠們在逃遁的時候，放射『鈞腺，』使敵人不能動彈。　　烟幕彈－烏賊魚在洋面上覓食的時候，倘若發見在暗中伺伏的敵人，便射出黑色的液汁，作爲掩護撤退的烟幕彈。牠們在那種烟幕彈掩護之下，逃回家去，等到沒有危險時再出來。　　掩飾物－自然界的能用掩飾術的動物，不勝枚舉。蜘蛛蟹的計策是最巧妙的。牠們採集了海藻，先咀嚼牠們使得容易長大，然後將牠們附在殼背上鈎曲的短毛上，海藻就在那裏生根，將這狡黠的蟹有効地隱蔽了。　　降落傘－在我們的樹林裹或草地上的蜘蛛，攀到一株樹上，就吐出一根游盪的長絲，當微風吹動細絲時，它就離開樹木爬到絲上隨絲飄盪，盪到它盼望的距離後，它收起降落傘，徐徐地落地。　　空戰－驅逐機因爲速率高和運用便利，能够擊退轟炸機。美洲熱帶產的蜂雀，也能用同樣方法拒敵，當巨鷹或別種刦掠者來强佔牠的窠時，牠就將牠那像矛一樣的失嘴瞄準對方的眼睛，猛撲過去，趕走敵人。發明遮眼罩與紙拖鞋  永運　　美國西北航空公司爲增加乘客舒適起見，新近供給一種遮眼罩。因爲帶上了遮眼罩以後，可避免光亮刺激眼睛。這樣便可以小睡片刻了，而坐在他身邊的另一乘客仍可照樣閱讀，兩下方便。　　此外還有一種紙拖鞋。這種拖鞋是用一種很柔軟的紙做成的，着在脚上凉爽輕便，眞是加惠乘客非淺也。秋海棠  秦瘦鷗　　十四　打英雄的生活　　「本來這個時候兵荒馬亂，上海的店鋪關閉了許多，那裹還能上洋行去找飯吃？」小客棧的老闆娘知道了這件事，便叉在當晚踅進秋海棠的房裹來，發揮了一大篇議論。「可是姑娘們容易討俏的地方也有，祗要你們把心思放得開一些，別把從前人所說的幾句老話看得太認眞了，要知道現在是什麼世界？」　　梅寳低下了頭，坐在一張已脫了筍的假紅木椅子上，靜着一句話也不說。　　「多謝你好心，太太，咱們在道兒是外路人，一切總得請你們指敎！」秋海棠用着富於外交氣味的語調回答，但心裹却儘在盤算明兒怎樣再去，找另外幾個熟人的事。　　這一會他的眼光總算沒有看錯，找到了一位在報館裏當編輯的錢先生，這位先生以前雖和秋海棠並沒有這樣深的交情，但爲人却非常豪爽，而且最肯幫助人家；祇聽秋海棠說了三四句話，便立刻打座位上跳起來，一面取下嘴角上所銜的那支老球牌雪茄烟，一面極度興奮地說：　　「那還有什麼說的？自然趕快想法子搭班啊！」　　秋海棠正想揷話，這位錢老先生却來不及的搖手止住·（二四五）</h3>

<p>游藝界　　影星們誨人不倦  禮義　　有些人以爲好萊塢的大明星們，大概架子總非常大的了！這種思想其實是錯誤的，有許多大明星們，非但虛懷若谷地接受人家的指敎，而且又誠懇地敎誨人們，這些大明星往往有許多還是敎師出身哩！無怪其秉有誨人不倦的精神了！　　唔女郞安秀麗丹，現在是一等紅星了，但她在未入影城的六年之前，執敎於北州學校，擔任英文，數學與西班牙文等課程，學生沒有不深深地愛護她。瑪黛琳卡洛兒與紅髮女郞葛雷瓊蓀，在未到美國進好萊塢之前，都是在英國做敎師的，其循循善誘的精神，無疑的也大受學生擁護。麗泰海華絲，這一顆哥倫比亞燦爛的明星，以前在好萊塢技術學校裏作舞蹈敎師，其舞姿早爲人賞識了！茂娜洛埃原來在克爾佛城自辦一個跳舞夜校，開的日子很長，在她敎導下成名的，倒也頗不乏人呢！派拉蒙有一個明星路易絲開蓓兒，她才是一個最認眞的敎師呢！她說，敎書最有趣，她有機會還是想去做敎師的。假使一個人居然有這樣美麗的明星小姐作其敎師，該是何等榮幸的事！那麼學問的突飛猛進，自然也在意料中啦！梨園人物小誌  鄭過冝作傳　坤伶之部　張義璋　製圖　　（六）王玉蓉　　王玉蓉，人家都說她出身伊始是秦淮歌女，此話並不確實；她未赴南京以前，已用了「王艷芳」的藝名，在上海的舞台上，唱過好些時戲，不過她北上投拜王瑤卿之先，嘗一度現色相於秣陵的羣芳會裏罷了。玉蓉的嗓子很好，——不像其他女角，有股細仄尖銳的「鬼音」，——處於今日坤伶隊中，可稱極選。又能堅忍自勵，是以獲王瑤卿指授獨多，不數年間，藝乃猛進。惟有她的京白，至今仍不及章遏雲純粹，是一缺點，而考較唱工，則章又微遜於她。——王瑤卿曾親向我說：他的女徒，雖遍南北皆是，但多數是成名而後，纔列人他的鬥牆，所以許多唱腔，因先入爲主，故轍難泯，有時竟不能一一强使就範，以期全符瑤卿的風格，獨王玉蓉從他學戲，尙還未甚得志，以是能够專精勿懈，不鶩旁趨，較之其他坤伶，王玉蓉算是還存瑤卿一二分面目之眞。由王瑤卿之言而推測，也可知王玉蓉所得於瑤卿的大概了。上海最新型的書塲  健帆　　上海租界內各書塲的佈置，像滙泉樓，南園，湖園，雅廬，富春，龍泉，玉茗樓，鳳鳴台等，和以前南市城內邑廟區的書塲一般因陋就簡，都還保存着舊式書塲的遺型。十餘年來，附設在旅館裏的書塲，此仆彼起，只有巍然獨存的東方書塲，設備較爲完善，如今東方的夜塲，專演話劇，已改建成小型劇塲了。其次如大羅天，南京書塲，以及附設在新型茶室裏的百花廳夜書塲，塲中座位佈置，也很不錯。自從今夏滄洲飯店的禮廳，闢作書塲，一切設備，堂皇富麗，聽客置身其間，已覺得耳目一新；可是最近開慕的張園書塲，設在樓上的珊瑚廳，美輪美奐，比滄洲還要完善，前後玻璃長窓，光錢充足。並像播音電台一般，屋頂下另裝集中聲浪的布罩，還在書台上裝置放音機，即使坐在最後一排的聽客，也能聽得淸楚。可說全合乎我們理想中的新型書塲。　　凡是新闢書塲所聘的各擋評話彈詞，此道中人喚做「靑龍擋」。張園的「靑龍擋」，日塲如沈儉安李念安的珍珠塔，吳子安的險唐，我已在本刋「各書塲秋擋健將」一文中談過了。餘如小輩彈詞家龐學庭謝漢庭的落金扇，二人都是蔣如庭的藝徒，已有相當造詣，以及潤餘社張鑑庭鑑邦的十美圖都很値得一聽。夜塲如侯九霞沈慧人的珠塔，歌喉珠圓玉潤，說來入情人理。劉天韻謝毓靑師徒的三笑，表白細膩熨貼，在雲峯的評證金槍傳，說來簡潔老到。末擋送客書陸鳳翔筱翔父子的玉崎蜓，滑稽突梯，我們化了低廉的代價，坐在這樣精雅絕倫的書塲裏，不是很舒服有趣嗎？梨園瑣記  邨人　　坤旦趙畹霜現猶留滬，不日往靑島獻藝，鄭冰如雖北返，但下月八日前後將再來申，係參加本市某府盛大堂會。　　趙曼雲今夕初試「新紡棉花」，因各方催促，故更新特提前貼演。又白家麟「定四郡」「張儀欺楚」「割麥裝神」諸劇，亦將陸續演出。　　大舞台有邀李萬春於明年新正來滬演唱之議，譚劇團演畢，將演「十三集神怪劍俠傳」刻芷從事編排。　　坤角靑衫張慧聰於下月間重隸樂園，抵韓素秋之缺。血雨瓊葩  顧道道　　第十八章　誓掃匈奴顧身　　於是白十二奉了命便去九門口請到張蒼虬和陳飛，又請了許靖枊　英，同至一個秘密的所在，是白十二特地安排下的，端整一桌極豐盛的筵席，上好的美酒，請四人歡飲。張蒼虬見白十二今天如此竭誠款接，心中有些疑惑。酒過三巡，白十二便把吳三桂急欲請張等赴京救出圓圓的心願吿訴四人聽，且代三桂要求張蒼虬等一行。許靖聽了，忍不住哈哈笑道：「英雄無奈是多情！楚霜王垓下之圍，江山尙且要拋棄，而撒不下虞姬，垓下一歌，千古雪涕，這是不能解說的。小弟聞陳圓圓確是江南第一美人，吳將軍得了，自然鶼鶼鰈鰈，寵擅專房。不幸而被闖賊據去，無怪將軍要深惜痛恨，戀戀不已，珠還合浦，劍躍延津，當然這是吳將軍所深切盼望的，然而可知國君新崩，神洲失陷，大明江山正在風雨飄搖，危急存亡之秋，做軍人的當如何枕戈待旦，拾身救國？國事私情，相提並論，其問的輕重緩急，必有人能辨的。現在吳將軍不知趕緊整飭三軍，去討流寇，却反念念不忘在一女子身上，豈不失之畸輕畸重嗎？」柳隱英却微笑不語，張蒼虬嚷起來道：「白兄弟，不是俺不肯徇情，這叫俺第一個不能答應去做。（二〇一）</p>

<h3>Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Officially Announces Government Moved to Samara City; Defense of Capital Intensified; Moscow Subjected to Heavy Bombing by German Aircraft</h3>
<p>TASS, Kuybyshev, 24th: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and Deputy Director of the Information Bureau Lozovsky stated, "The Soviet government and several People's Committees have temporarily moved to Kuybyshev (formerly Samara) to resume work. The Soviet Defense Committee, led by Stalin, will remain in Moscow to carry out its tasks. The transfer of some government agencies is by no means a sign that the defense of Moscow has weakened. On the contrary, defensive work will continue with even greater courage and determination. In other words, the Soviet government and people will continue to resist until Hitler's Germany is completely defeated. At a time when the enemy has broken through a certain point near Mozhaisk, Moscow is carrying out a partial evacuation so that diplomatic corps and some government agencies can continue their work in a safe environment."</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th: News received here today indicates that the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Stafford Cripps, and members of the British mission have established an office in Kuybyshev (Samara). The Soviet Union has clearly declared that Moscow remains the Soviet capital. Soviet government leaders, including Stalin, are currently stationed there. However, some government departments and foreign diplomatic missions have temporarily moved to Kuybyshev.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 24th: Last night, a large number of German aircraft attempted to attack Moscow. Most were dispersed by anti-aircraft fire and our aircraft formations. Only a few aircraft penetrated and dropped bombs. Several civilian houses caught fire, resulting in some casualties. No military targets were damaged.</p>
<p>Fresh Soviet Troops Deployed to Central Front; Timoshenko Reassigned to Southern Front</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th: Fresh Soviet reserve troops have joined the fighting on the central front. German forces are also concentrating their main forces again to attack Moscow. At the same time, the Germans are still trying to break through the Perekop Isthmus to enter Crimea and seize the industrial area of the Donets Basin. According to Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and government spokesman Lozovsky, former Central Front Commander General Timoshenko has taken over command of the Southern Front. Generals Budyonny and Voroshilov have both completed the preparation of new troops and will soon join the front. German losses in the new offensive over the past 20 days have reached 300,000 men. The new Central Front Commander, General Zhukov, is currently leading his troops in fierce fighting with the German army near Kalinin, 100 miles northwest of Moscow. The city is currently in the hands of the Soviet army.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th: A diplomatic correspondent for the Daily Telegraph reports that according to responsible sources, General Zhukov's appointment as Commander of the Soviet Central Front does not imply any criticism of General Timoshenko. Stalin has selected Timoshenko for a very important new task. The public can only speculate on this appointment. However, in the eyes of a far-sighted military strategist like Stalin, organizing well-prepared resistance in the North Caucasus region, behind General Budyonny's troops and the entire Don and Volga River front, will be the second key step in the future. People here are very familiar with Zhukov's military knowledge and believe that he will be able to handle the new task. Zhukov has served as Deputy Commissar of Defense and Chief of the Soviet General Staff and has had close contact with Stalin, who serves as the Defense Commissar.</p>
<p>Germany Exerting All Efforts to Assault Soviet Capital; Hoping to End War Against Soviet Union Soon</p>
<p>Central News Agency, London, 24th: British military experts recently stated that all the forces of the German war machine have simultaneously rushed towards the snowy area near Moscow, the wetlands of the Crimean Isthmus, and the muddy areas of the Donets Basin, in an attempt to begin the task of ending their conquest of western Russia. They also stated that the German army has reached the limit of its offensive power and must achieve the goal of ending the war in order to prepare for the second phase of the winter war, an attack on the Near East. British military experts stated that if the German army wins a complete victory in these three theaters in the next few weeks, it can complete the hopes listed in its timetable, pacify the central and northern Soviet front lines, and at the same time, the Nazis also hope to invade southern Ukraine to probe into the Caucasus or Turkey, or even advance on both places simultaneously, so that they can realize their hope of attacking the Suez Canal and re-launch a Libyan war. They also stated that various unpleasant news from Moscow has shown that Hitler is desperately deploying troops in an attempt to capture the Soviet capital and expects that the Soviet Union's acknowledgment of fierce fighting north and south of Moscow will reveal that the Germans are launching fierce attacks on the Soviet capital by means of flanking maneuvers or encirclements.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 24th: The Soviet newspaper Izvestia reports that on the ninth day of the battle for Moscow, the Germans invaded Kalinin (an important city 100 miles northwest of Moscow). Street fighting is currently underway. The enemy is using large numbers of tanks in dense attacks, but the Red Army is resolutely resisting. Not only have they repelled the enemy's attacks, but they have also launched successful counterattacks. The Soviet army is determined to defend the city at all costs and has built anti-tank obstacles in the streets. The city is full of trenches, like a honeycomb.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th: The battle for Moscow has entered its third week. The Soviets announced that they had repelled multiple fierce attacks by Nazi forces in the Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets areas. Soviet forces behind the German front lines in several areas of the Moscow front are operating quite successfully, and guerrillas near Smolensk and Kalinin are particularly active. The Germans claim that in the past few days, the German army has broken through a wide front near Mozhaisk, and the vanguard has reached a location within 40 miles of Moscow. On the southern front, the German army has launched a renewed offensive towards Crimea. Intense land and air battles are reported at Perekop. Although German casualties are heavy, they are constantly reinforced with fresh troops. Heavy snowstorms are currently occurring around Leningrad at the northern end of the front. News from Moscow reports intense street fighting is still taking place south of the city of Kalinin, northwest of Moscow. On the southwestern front, the German army is being firmly blocked in the Orel region. The recent Soviet communique stated that 37 German aircraft were destroyed on Wednesday, and 11 Soviet aircraft were also lost. It is now known that a total of 35 German aircraft were shot down near the Soviet capital on Wednesday, not the previously reported 16. In addition, a Soviet aircraft formation attacked a German-held airfield and destroyed 100 German fighter planes.</p>
<p>The Soviet newspaper Izvestia reports that the Soviet forces on the northern front, about two months ago, were forced to abandon Novgorod after six days of fierce fighting due to being outnumbered. However, the German attempt to continue advancing across the Volkhov River and Lake Ilmen has failed. After the Soviet army evacuated Novgorod, they defended their positions along the lake and river. All German advances were repelled by Soviet artillery fire and infantry counterattacks. Although the German army repeatedly changed its tactics, it has not gained an inch to this day. The German army once sent two companies of infantry across the river, hoping to launch a fierce attack on the Soviet lines. In addition to ordinary infantry weapons, the two German companies were equipped with direct-fire guns, small steel guns, and mortars, but they were eventually completely annihilated by the Soviet army, and all special equipment was abandoned on the battlefield. The Soviet army used these steel guns and mortars to bombard enemy positions. In addition, the German army has repeatedly made attempts to advance, but also encountered the same tragic results. At the same time, the Soviet garrison has formed "suppression" battalions, which operate behind enemy lines to destroy German fortifications and transportation, and hold the highways and railways between Xingke and Novgorod amidst constant artillery fire to block enemy movements. The Red Army artillery in this area has destroyed 60 German cannons and 35 mortar teams.</p>
<p>Germany, Leveraging its Superiority in Troop Strength, Launches Large-Scale Invasion of Crimea</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th: A Reuters military commentator states that according to recent communiques, intense fighting has broken out along the entire Eastern Front. The German High Command communique first mentions the battle for Moscow, stating that German forces have advanced to within 38 miles of Moscow in some locations, and that the Soviet front lines in a vast area west and southwest of Moscow have been broken. However, the German side also acknowledges that Soviet resistance is very strong. The Soviet communique only states that there is fierce fighting on the front lines, but judging from news reports and broadcasts from Moscow radio, the German army has deployed fresh troops and has only made slight progress by relying on numerical superiority. The impact of the weather on the war is gradually increasing, and the German army must already be experiencing inconvenience. Recent news reports that it rains and snows during the day and freezes at night, but it cannot yet be said that severe winter has begun. Regarding the battle situation on the southern front, the Soviets stated that they have contained the German forces advancing east from Taganrog, and the Soviets have not admitted that Stalino has been lost. German advances towards Rostov and Kharkov may not have made any progress. However, the German army has launched a renewed large-scale attack on Crimea. Its vanguard has made slight progress on the Perekop Isthmus and has reached Yushun at the southeastern end of the isthmus. The Soviet garrison will apparently concentrate its firepower on this narrow isthmus and put up the strongest resistance. The German side may use paratroopers or air-transported troops for this, but the Soviet army is prepared and controls the sea, making it easy to transport military supplies and fresh troops to reinforce the Crimean garrison.</p>
<p>Reuters, Kuybyshev, 24th: The German Southern Front army, led by General von Rundstedt, launched an offensive towards Taganrog, making a second attempt to capture the city. Previously, the German army advanced eastward across Ukraine and, after capturing Mariupol, attacked the small city of Taganrog, hoping to capture it in one fell swoop. Unexpectedly, it encountered strong Soviet resistance and could not advance. Rundstedt urgently deployed reserve troops and carried out flanking maneuvers, but also failed. He then changed his tactics, continued to deploy fresh troops as reinforcements, and knowing that he could not advance along the coast, attacked the right flank of the Soviet army to the north. Both sides gathered large armies to fight. The German army suffered heavy losses. Although the Soviet army recovered some areas, the Rundstedt's troops were very strong and launched a second attack. The Soviet army was outnumbered and has now been forced to retreat to new positions.</p>
<h3>Eden Reaffirms Guarantee Not to Negotiate with Germany; Will Provide Maximum Aid to the Soviet Union to Secure Victory; British House of Commons Holds Free Debate on War Situation</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th: Foreign Secretary Eden assured the House of Commons yesterday that the British government will not negotiate any matters with Hitler or others. Eden revealed that there was a time, in the summer of 1940, when there was not a single division of troops in Britain that was well-trained and well-equipped, so that Britain had no defense in reality, and the Middle East forces at that time also lacked all modern equipment. The Foreign Secretary also stated that the term "aid to the Soviet Union" was incorrect and should be "aid to common victory." The whole purpose is one purpose. The British side holds this view, so it is transporting urgently needed supplies to the Soviet Union and opening up a route through Iran. At a time like the present, the government's responsibility is to use judgment to determine its plans and maintain its policy. If we do not do everything we can to help the Soviet Union, it will at least be of no benefit to us. The British government has studied the opportunity presented by the German attack on the Soviet Union, but the results cannot be disclosed now, otherwise it will fall into the enemy's trap. Eden concluded by stating that he can issue a guarantee that the government will provide the Soviet Union with all possible assistance within its capabilities, and he asks the members of the House of Commons to trust those who are carrying out this policy. Uniting the strength of the country is the best way to help the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th: A Reuters political correspondent reports that the debate in the House of Commons on the war situation retains its original character, that is, many members of Parliament freely discuss various issues without any reservations. Foreign Secretary Eden's reply, "We are determined to give the Soviet Union all the assistance we can in every way, and the British government does not want to negotiate any matters with Hitler or others," did not cause any reaction, because the government always takes this courteous action towards the House of Commons after the House of Commons discusses major events. At the same time, members of Parliament also focus on other issues such as the organization of supplies and manpower, because this is related to the entire war effort. As a whole, the country and members of Parliament are determined to actively assist the Soviet Union and to inflict a severe blow on the enemy as soon as possible, so the Parliament will continue to urge the government to continue to adopt necessary plans as permitted by the environment. Therefore, criticism of the government by members of Parliament will continue, but this is constructive criticism and should not be regarded as any political inconvenience to the government at present.</p>
<p>Young British Women Sell Kisses to Raise Funds; One Kiss for One Shilling; £6 Million Already Raised</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th: A team of beautiful, unmarried women from a Birmingham armaments factory is currently selling kisses to raise funds for the city's warships. The price is set at one shilling per kiss, but most customers are offering up to two shillings and sixpence. 42 pounds have been sold in the last three days. According to an official, only female employees initially launched the initiative, but female workers soon followed suit, and there is currently a lot of competition between the two sides. Birmingham has raised £6,770,000 towards its target of £10 million for this weekend.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Ever-Rising Prices</h3>
<p>Over the past week, the turmoil and commotion in the Shanghai market have remained unchanged from previous days, with prices soaring and speculation rampant. The cost of living continues to decline, with prices rising by hundreds or thousands of yuan within the city and fluctuating by more than ten resolutions in a single day. We only see prices going up, never down, only advancing, never retreating, as if the legal tender is worthless. This has led to this abnormal state, which cannot be judged by ordinary logic!</p>
<p>Although Shanghai is far from the theater of war, it has not escaped the wartime atmosphere, so it is still constrained by the movements of the war. It is difficult to achieve fairness in small transactions, and even more difficult to achieve accuracy. Moreover, in the absence of regulation, all kinds of evil forces are acting together, with both buying and selling short intermingled. Biased words are easily listened to, and great profits are easily motivated. Manipulation and hoarding are connected, which is inevitable in reality. However, to maintain social stability, it is essential to maintain the stability of life. Today, the instability of general life has reached its extreme. What is earned in the morning is not enough to ensure a full meal in the evening. Goods are abundant but stubbornly refuse to be sold, because the price of goods is rising too fast, only going up and not down. Although hoarding may have twists and turns, as long as it is given a little time, it will be as good as one wishes, which is why more and more is hoarded, and the price of goods is difficult to stabilize.</p>
<p>To stabilize prices, one must rely on strength; strength refers to administrative strength and economic strength! Administrative strength means having the actual power to regulate the market, but the methods must not allow for exceptions, and the handling must not allow for differences. Those who go against this must be corrected and punished. However, administrative strength is sometimes exhausted; moreover, market regulation cannot be entirely achieved by power. Even the exercise of power may lead to the ineffectiveness of regulation, with loopholes emerging and being coerced. Therefore, it is necessary to supplement it with economic strength, just as the initial restriction of rice prices by the Shanghai Municipal Council was ineffective, but public sales could achieve some success in maintaining the people's food supply.</p>
<p>If it is said that regulating prices only requires focusing on retail, and not questioning wholesale, then it is as if hoarding and speculating are not being addressed. Is it that we will exercise administrative power to interfere? Otherwise, it is no different from making a small piece of wood taller than a towering building. It must be understood that the reason why prices are so high today is not entirely due to the hoarding of retailers, but to the collusion of speculative merchants, large households hoarding, and intermediaries. If there is a plan to get to the root of the problem, then effective steps should be taken for the futures and spot markets. For example, the buying and selling of gold itself has nothing to do with daily necessities; and its rise is not due to any changes in foreign exchange. It is simply that a few people suddenly suffer from gold poisoning, taking advantage of the fact that more than half of the gold bars are in cellars and the lack of circulating chips in the market to collect them in a big way, not minding the price, not considering it too much. Those who hold goods naturally regard themselves as rare commodities. A transaction volume of four or five hundred bars often rises by thousands of yuan. Yesterday, it even saw a high price of 18,900 yuan. Another example is Shuangma cotton yarn, where actual sales are not moving, and many weaving factories are reducing work, but the price of yarn is galloping, with no day without a limit-up and no day without a new high price. All industries are delighted at the sight of profit, regardless of sales, the amount of inventory, or the strength of the source, and they are able to raise prices. In this way, it directly threatens the lives of the masses; the rise in rice, flour, oil, and beans, the expensiveness of clothing and miscellaneous items, the high price of candles, soap, cigarettes, and paper, and the exorbitant rent are all clearly caused by a few people affecting the overall situation.</p>
<p>The fact that we supply foreign exchange, and that the black market exchange rate is still allowed to be rampant, is also a major reason why prices are not easy to stabilize. If foreign exchange is supplied as usual, then how it is supplied should be clearly stated; if it is no longer supplied, then it should be announced as soon as possible, so what is there to worry about. The most heartbreaking thing is indecision, hesitation, and rumors abound. The heart is empty and panicked, as if leaving this loophole is not only creating opportunities for speculative merchants, but also creating room for those with capital to escape. If normal necessities are still supplied with foreign exchange as usual, then the goods supplied should be announced weekly so that the public has the necessary knowledge and does not allow buying and selling merchants to embezzle them. The price should be fairly determined by the importer and the industry in accordance with their reasonable profits, and this should be followed as the retail price, without any increase or decrease. The goods should be directly distributed to retailers by wholesalers or agents, and should not be circulated and traded on the market under the names of warehouse receipts or futures, for the purpose of manipulation and hoarding. Wholesalers should try to deal directly with consumers as much as possible, but it may be possible to slightly limit the sales volume. That is, practitioners should also distribute goods to wholesalers or brokerage firms according to the actual sales volume of their street, and should not allow them to monopolize sales, just like the recent actions of various industries. Publicly sold goods, whether publicly or privately owned, should be sold under the same evaluation and sales organization so that the quality and price are unified, and expensive goods are not mixed with inferior goods, so as not to cause obstacles in procurement and lose credibility with consumers. It is also necessary to have a proper method of popularizing to direct consumers, not targeting traders and manufacturers. The last sale of flat-rate flour only benefited intermediaries and peddlers who lived by trading, and genuine consumers had no way to buy it.</p>
<p>British and American merchants, because of the advice of their governments, sacrificed temporary small profits and sought cooperation with the Chinese Stabilization Board, and cooperation requires sincere cooperation, not superficial agreement and internal discord. All unnecessary commodities, even if the profits are generous, should not be underwritten; the foreign exchange of exported goods should still be settled with the Stabilization Board; the elimination of the black market exchange rate should be done with the greatest effort; the difficulties currently facing us should be overcome together. Moreover, Shanghai's essential necessities of life, such as rice and flour, and other foreign goods, are now mostly supplied by Hong Kong. Today, the price of goods in Hong Kong has not changed much, but the exchange rate between Hong Kong and Shanghai is frequently tightening in the black market, with a wide disparity. If the original relationship can be maintained and today's exchange rate can be improved, it may slightly alleviate the difficulties of Shanghai's life and form an economic and popular front to cope with the present and plan for the future, which is a crucial plan.</p>
<p>European War Anecdotes</p>
<h3>The Anguish of the French</h3>
<p>This article was written by the famous French reporter He Sales, originally published in the American "Atlantic Monthly". I have copied it below, from which we can see the anguish of the French after the defeat:</p>
<p>What does it mean to be French? Until a year ago, I never thought about this question, just as I would not ask myself why I was born with two hands and two feet.</p>
<p>I was born in France and educated in France. I have lived in France for most of my life. I have traveled everywhere and know the situation in France very well. I love the richness and diversity of France, the different situations in each province, and the different climates. When I returned from a long trip, I really felt like I had seen an old friend. Whether it was the air, the light, the fields, the trees, the cities, or the villages, they all gave me a very familiar impression, just like looking in the mirror and seeing my own face. At that time, I did not say to myself: "This is France, I am a Frenchman." Such obvious things do not need to be mentioned, of course. But when I saw the spire of a church, or a road lined with poplars, or tasted the flavor of bread, the infinite complexity of this intimate feeling once again proved that I have been unconsciously connected with this special place on earth since I was born.</p>
<p>I also know that the French who were born in the same era as me, and the millions of French who have been born here, grown here, worked here, and died here throughout the ages, have done many great things in the past and produced many great people. In the future, they will certainly be able to continue to rise up and fulfill their part of the responsibility for building civilization.</p>
<p>I also know our faults and am troubled and uneasy about them. I like to read the writings of Stendhal (the pen name of the French writer Beyle). He sincerely believes that he does not like the French, saying that they are flashy and impractical, but in fact, is he not extremely so himself?</p>
<p>I don't know if I am a patriot. I don't even know if I am a good Frenchman. I have never asked myself. In the first thirty years of my life, I paid more attention to literature, art, and music, and not much attention to politics. When politics (this is politics in a broad sense) became my main career, I did not think that those who agreed with me were good Frenchmen, and those who disagreed with me were not as good as them. In my opinion, it seems that one of the best advantages of being French is the freedom to disagree with others.</p>
<p>In short, my feelings about this question a few months ago, as far as I can remember, I feel that there has never been any conflict between my awareness of being born a human being and my accidental birth as a Frenchman. France seems to have a certain value for me, and this value is so universal, so broad, and so empathetic that it makes people patiently experience many wars, many revolutions, and many disputes among many talented French people.</p>
<p>I never thought that France could be destroyed. I don't believe it now, but I have to add a note when I say this today. First, I don't know what method France will use, or what kind of reincarnation it must go through, to be able to re-express her lively spirit. Second, I don't know if France's rebirth will be something I will see in my lifetime, or if I will have to wait thirty, fifty, or a hundred years. Finally, if this matter can be realized in the near future, I don't know if I can recognize or understand the signs of rebirth. There may be many vain attempts to rebuild France, and I don't know if I can avoid falling into this trap or going astray.</p>
<p>If this is something that only I or a few people encounter, it is of course irrelevant except to ourselves. But this suffering is almost what we all have to encounter, what 40 million French people who are now struggling in the shadows of disappointment, sorrow, and hardship have to encounter together.</p>
<p>France has lost everything. In this defeat, every Frenchman and France itself has suffered a deadly blow. Those who want to prove to themselves and others for various reasons that this is not an absolute failure are deceiving themselves with a bad conscience. When I say that France has lost everything or suffered a fatal blow, I am speaking for the current generation. I know very well that young people have new lives ahead of them. They may be able to rebuild from the rubble, but today, there is only a pile of rubble. This is the reality.</p>
<p>I often see new maps of France in the newspapers, divided by the boundaries of the occupied and unoccupied zones, and I feel deeply hurt and heartbroken. A map is originally abstract, but this boundary is a transcendent reality, because it represents the country's dismemberment. This is not our defined national border, but the arbitrary disposal of the victors. It is like this today, and it can be changed tomorrow. This boundary passes through rivers, roads, and railways. Because of this boundary, France's blood cannot circulate in the body. Moreover, the result of dismemberment not only affects the material life of the people, but also affects their moral and psychological relations. Families are dispersed because of this. Even if France has the possibility of reunifying, it will be blocked by this boundary. Those who live in the south and those who live in the north are isolated from each other, as if there is a high-voltage power line between them. This is a special form of Nazi brutality, often with a sadomasochistic color. This boundary is tantamount to dividing France into two concentration camps, the only difference being that one is directly ruled by the Germans, and the other is under the illusion of the French that they are still under their own protection.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to spend too much time talking about the chaos of French life. Newspaper reports and travelers' talks have already given detailed descriptions. What is strange is that a country that has always been characterized by abundance, comfort, and elegance has fallen so quickly. I know that there is a school of thought in France that believes that the tragedy suffered today is also due to the weakness cultivated by the people's comfortable life. Marshal Pétain seems to belong to this school. It is inevitable that taking butter instead of guns lacks foresight, but I still believe that this is not a sin. France has always wanted to allow everyone to obtain a perfect life as much as possible, and her attempt has achieved no small success. If measured by statistics, the living standard in France is still not as high as that in the United States, but as far as its pervasive nature is concerned, it seems to be unmatched by any country. At least that's what the outside world thinks. France is also known to the world for this.</p>
<p>This particularity of French life has now become a historical relic. The hardships of today may give rise to a new kind of spirit. This assumption may be correct. But many French people think that the sins we are suffering now are well-deserved. In my opinion, it is a mistake of judgment, due to too much disappointment. It is tantamount to saying that the French are too civilized, so they are now being punished. If so, it is tantamount to admitting the Nazi doctrine. In the world, there is no other law besides strength. Brutality is a healthy behavior. There is no other purpose than to maintain efficiency for the sake of efficiency and to organize a mechanical country.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many French people, even the best French people, cannot help but be shocked by the power of the German war machine, and dare not think of anything other than material efficiency. There is no question about the superiority of German war materials and their skillful use. As a result, most French people want to rationalize their failure, according to the Q-style, as if calculating a general one. If this kind of French ethics is applied with effort, it is indeed the most dangerous thing in intellectual activity. With this ability, the French have established a series of realistic formulas to explain the inevitability of the paths they have taken in the past and to plan their future actions.

<h3>After the Completion of the Hong Kong Economic Conference, Shanghai's Legal Tender Situation Can Be Improved</h3>
<p>The Stabilization Fund Committee Established a Kunming Branch to Be Responsible for Reviewing Merchants' Requests for Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Chongqing According to the news released here today, the Chinese Fu Bureau is confident that after the completion of the meeting of Chinese, British and American economic representatives in Hong Kong, the situation of Shanghai's legal tender can be improved. The Hong Kong meeting should discuss the plan to deal with the situation in Shanghai. At the same time, the Kunming news said that Kunming has set up an office representing the Chinese Stabilization Board to review foreign exchange applications. The Kunming office will be held by the American representative Dai Le and the Chinese representative Tu Weiying (transliteration). (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Chongqing Kunming News The Stabilization Fund Committee has established a branch here, responsible for reviewing commercial exchange, which was established on the 21st, presided over by Dai Lai and Du Weiying. Those merchants who need foreign exchange submit an application to one of the four banks of China, China, Transportation, and Agriculture. If the bank believes it is justified, it will transfer it to the branch for application on its behalf. Therefore, the right to approve or disapprove commercial exchange is still in the hands of the Niuzhun Association. In addition to commercial exchange, travel expenses, insurance fees, and living expenses can also be given in cash within a certain limit. Those who apply for foreign exchange mostly use Hong Kong dollars. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Reclamation Committee Officially Established</h3>
<p>Shaoguan In order to use overseas Chinese capital, develop industries, and relieve righteous people, the Guangdong Provincial Government specially organized the Overseas Chinese Capital Reclamation Committee, which has been formally established and started work.

It is reported that recently, the American Medical Aid to China Association donated more than 20,000 US dollars to assist this training. (24th telegram)</p>
<h3>One Week of War Situation October 16th to 22nd</h3>
<p>Chongqing The military committee spokesman said that since the Japanese defeat in northern Hunan and their failures in western Hubei, northern Hubei, and Henan, their vitality has been greatly damaged, and they have begun to believe that the more the Chinese army fights, the stronger it becomes, which is not an empty word. Therefore, they have some concerns and dare not act rashly. Therefore, this week has entered a state of truce, but they are still rushing to build fortifications in Zhengzhou in order to consolidate its periphery, erect pontoon bridges to facilitate its rear, and continue to increase their troops. We judge that the Japanese not only have the intention of occupying it for a long time, but may also be planning something. As for the general war situation, the larger ones are described as follows:</p>
<p>South Bank of the Yellow River</p>
<p>The various troops counterattacking in central Henan have made considerable gains in recent days. In addition to capturing Zhangzhuang Street in Zhongmu and recovering Dahu Village in Rongze, they have also captured the Wulipu stronghold on the outskirts of Zhengzhou, and the Japanese have been retreating towards Zhengzhou city. In order to reverse the decline, the Japanese are still gathering more than 4,000 troops and more than a dozen cannons and seven tanks from south of the Yellow River Railway Bridge. At dawn on the 21st, they advanced in three groups towards Guangwu. At 11 o'clock, they invaded the city. The Chinese army is currently fiercely resisting in the Tangdong, Tanggang, and Wanglou areas.</p>
<p>Suiyuan Area</p>
<p>The ten-way troops of Huaihua attacking Anbei, Guyang, and Lianxian have encountered the Japanese for days, destroying many Japanese cannons and tanks, and killing many Japanese. They also killed three Japanese captains and a number of soldiers under them behind Kundulun. At the same time, the Chinese attacked the Japanese who were entrenched in Dashiwan, Xiaowei, and Zhaojun Tomb, and the gains were even greater. In addition to killing hundreds of Japanese, they also captured personnel, war horses, and many other supplies. They also completely destroyed the Japanese communication facilities from Zhaojun Tomb to Youyi Village.</p>
<p>Western Hubei Area</p>
<p>The Japanese have increased to more than 1,000 in Changmuyuan, Maolaodian, Lujiaodian and other places south of Shayang, and are invading south in several directions. The Chinese are resisting. The Japanese who invaded south from Jiangling Cenhekou were defeated by the Chinese. More than 4,000 Japanese were reinforced from Shashi and attacked Zifusi, Panzhangqiao, Wujiaqiao and other places in several directions. Their vanguard continued to advance towards Zhuhekou and has been strongly resisted by the Chinese. The battle is extremely fierce.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangxi Area</p>
<p>The Japanese who were entrenched in Zhonghengjinkou, Boyouhe and other places east of Wuning were completely defeated by the Chinese and fled towards Zhu. (23rd telegram)</p>

<h3>The United States Changes the Route for Aiding the Soviet Union, Not Related to the Pacific Situation The Official Explanation is that This Move is Not Appeasement of Japan, and it is Most Convenient to Transport Soviet Military Supplies via the White Sea</h3>
<p>Reuters Washington, 24th The State Department has strongly denied the claim that the news that the US Shipping Commission will ship all goods to the Soviet Union from the port of Boston is related to the Japanese situation in the Pacific. Earlier this week, there was a rumor that the new Japanese government had notified the United States that items destined for the Soviet Union passing through Vladivostok would be intercepted. Well-informed sources said that the fastest route to supply the Soviet army is from Boston via the North Atlantic and the White Sea to Arkangelsk.</p>
<p>Havas Washington, 22nd After the US Shipping Commission decided to designate the port of Boston as the only port for shipping military equipment to the Soviet Union, there were rumors that this matter was related to the situation in the Pacific. The State Department has recently denied this claim. O'Leary, the private secretary of President Roosevelt, told reporters that the United States' material assistance to the Soviet Union will be delivered on time, and the quantity will be equal to the promise made by the US delegation in Moscow. President Roosevelt has already stated this. As for when the goods must arrive and where they will be shipped from, there is no need to explain. It is reported that US newspapers carried news from Japan that the Japanese government intends to obstruct US ships carrying military equipment to the port of Vladivostok. Therefore, in order to avoid unexpected incidents between the United States and Japan, the United States has decided to temporarily not use the port of Vladivostok to transport military equipment to the Soviet Union. In view of the above statement of the State Department, it can be seen that this conclusion is obviously wrong. The responsible parties also said that the US Shipping Commission's decision was actually for another reason. In other words, it is to speed up the shipment of goods to Moscow. If it takes ten days to ship from the port of Vladivostok, it will only take 48 hours to arrive from the port of Archangelsk. However, according to Article 2 of the current Neutrality Act, US merchant ships cannot sail to the White Sea and the port of Archangelsk. Therefore, before this clause is repealed, US merchant ships must still fly foreign flags.</p>
<p>Reuters London, 27th This news, that the US Shipping Commission should announce that goods destined for the USSR are now to take the Arkhangelsk route, is viewed here as rather odd, and indeed there was a lot of curiosity expressed yesterday. Official sources here are reserving comment until the receipt of information from the British embassy in the US, however the diplomatic correspondent for the Times claims that the Commission will have many reasons for making that decision, that Tokyo thinks it already understands the reasons, when in fact it does not. Indeed in recent months, there have been many answers to the question of why the US was forced to abandon the original route, for example, in August, when Japan issued a communique to the US and Soviet Union on the matter, both nations responded that they would continue to use the route to Vladivostok, being just one such example. The US, although not wishing to provoke Japan in any way, has indicated in private and public, that it will not sacrifice the Soviet Union to concede to Japan. That respondent also states that on the other hand, if that Commission's announcement contains any implication that it is abandoning Vladivostok as a route open to US vessels, then it will have some impact on the US-Japan talks, but the US Department of State has strenuously denied this.</p>
<h3>US and Japan Seek Understanding Negotiations Continue</h3>
<p>Japanese Spokesman Ishii Declares That Established National Policy Will Not Be Abandoned</p>
<p>Reuters Tokyo, 14th Japanese Information Bureau spokesman Ishii, in his usual routine with foreign reporters this morning, stated that Japan could not terminate the establishment of the "New Order in East Asia." When reporters questioned other aspects of Japan's policy, Ishii would not provide a definitive answer, but said that US-Japan talks are currently ongoing in Washington. As for the content of any messages received on this matter following the cabinet reshuffle, Ishii would not disclose. Ishii told reporters that the United States' decision to stop transporting military supplies from Vladivostok to the Soviet Union was a very good thing related to all countries. He believed that this move could ease the relationship between the United States and Japan. However, as a member of the Axis powers, Japan could not completely ignore the transportation of war equipment to the Soviet Union. Ishii then referred to an editorial in the Japanese newspaper Guangzhi Shiyuan, which stated that Japan was the only appropriate country to mediate world peace, saying that this was the opinion of the newspaper and not the government, but it was very good, and no one could object to world peace.</p>
<h3>American Liner Refuses to Carry Japanese Passengers; President Line Denies the Rumor; Tatsuta Maru Arrives at Honolulu</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 24th - "The Nichi Nichi Shimbun" today published a special dispatch from Manila stating that American liners are refusing to carry Japanese passengers. The dispatch claimed that this refusal has caused rumors, alleging it is due to armed vessels.

<h3>Wild Rise, Sharp Fall, Sudden Reaction: Gold Market Up and Down 3,200 Yuan: Highest Price 18,900 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market experienced amazing storms and became increasingly treacherous. It started with a fall, followed by a wild rise, and then a sharp fall. There were often fluctuations of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Each continued bid from the supply and demand sides raised the price by at least 50 to 100 yuan, and sometimes the buyer's request to purchase would raise the price by 500 yuan. The opposite was also true for sellers. The chaotic situation can be seen in general. The morning started with the money shops releasing their holdings, resulting in a low opening price of 15,700 yuan. The two Chinese banks saw the low price and rushed in, and the Hong Kong banks rushed in even more bravely. Retail investors followed suit, and the price soared, rising wildly by 3,200 yuan. In the afternoon, it soared to an unprecedented high price of 18,900 yuan, due to the release of holdings by gold shops and the Chaozhou and Tianjin gangs. There were even rumors of negative news, and those who released their holdings gathered together, causing a 2,000 yuan drop. It retreated to 16,800 yuan. In the end, a certain bank rushed in again to purchase 700 to 800 taels, and the price rose again. The market closed up 820 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 6,000 taels. The futures gold price was actually made up of buy and sell transactions by one or two agents. In 80 taels of transactions, the price was adjusted down by 700 yuan.</p>
<p>Cash Still High by 820 Yuan: The Price Began to Fall and Rise Again in Mid-Tenure. In the morning, the price was called down to within 16,000 yuan due to the fierce release of holdings by Decheng. It was sold to Yongcheng and others for 30 taels at 5,700 yuan, opening 680 yuan lower. Not long after, the price soared in a frenzy of buying. Defu rushed in to purchase more than 400 taels. Hesheng, Xinfeng, and Yongyue became more and more brave in rushing in, and the price flew out of the 6,000 and 7,000 yuan marks.

Decheng and others rushed in, and the price soared again by 1,300 yuan, appearing at an unprecedented high price of 18,900 yuan. Suddenly, it was heard that the price of raw silk was falling wildly outside the market due to rumors of negative news, and the market also reacted and fell back. Chengji and others rushed out, falling back 1,600 yuan to 17,300 yuan. Xiangxing, Yong, and others released their holdings, falling back to 6,800 yuan. In the end, Hefeng and Defu were seen buying in. The market closed at 4:00 p.m. at 17,200 yuan, up 820 yuan from the previous day.

<h3>US Exchange Rate Seen at 3 Yuan: Some Banks Have Prices but No Market, New Tight Price</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: the Central Bank and HSBC exchange rates did not change. The prices at the small counters of HSBC and others were also flat. The black market for British and American exchange rates was still in a chaotic state and continued to become tight. The unprecedented new expensive price of having prices but no market was seen again. Many people were seeking to settle US exchange rates at 3.125 yuan, but no transactions were heard being made, even though there were some sellers at less than 3 yuan. At the 4:00 p.m. closing, the British exchange rate was 2 pence, and the US exchange rate was 3 yuan, tighter by 0.0625 and 0.125 yuan respectively from the previous day.</p>

<h3>Silk Market Waves Soaring: Two Situations in One Day: Morning Limit Up... Afternoon Limit Down</h3>
<p>The situation in the silk market is still fierce, and the market is in constant turmoil, making people feel uneasy all day long. It is completely terrified by the price of gold. People generally ignore everything. When the price of gold jumps, they drag it in, and when it falls, they release it. Therefore, the market is full of soaring waves. The morning opened with 20-count Double Horse. Today, there are large investors coming out to maintain the market, which can stabilize the market and prevent it from hitting the limit up. The first market price was 2,475 yuan. At this time, the situation was soft, gradually falling back to 2,370 yuan, falling by 100 yuan from the opening. However, the market tightened, and at the same time, the price of gold rose, and the price of the transaction jumped, and the rising wind suddenly rose. Although a certain party tried its best to sell at 2,490 yuan, the buyers kept calling for higher prices to buy in. As a result, it was still the limit up of 2,490 yuan, and the after-hours market had reached 2,520 yuan, creating a terrifying situation. The market could not be done in the afternoon. In the afternoon, the prices of yarn and cloth in the transaction all fell miserably, because the rumor said that there was a rumor of settlement, and at the same time, there was negative news. Gold Double Horse also hit the limit down. Some people also said that gold fell sharply, and more long positions were released. In short, the silk market was in a chaotic state. According to the statistics of transactions in half a day, there were 15,000 packages. Today, there were 100 pieces of Japanese yarn shipped to Yantai.</p>
<p>The price of Gold Double Horse futures fluctuated sharply, rising and falling by more than 200 yuan. Since this sharp rise in the yarn market, the limit up has been reached more than five times in a row. Although the old long investors did not move, there were still many short investors entering and leaving one after another, licking blood from the knife's edge. The pursuit of margin for futures yarn was postponed to 10:00 a.m. The trend in November was soft at first, opening at a low price of 2,290 yuan. After entering, the price gradually rose to 2,360 yuan. The opening price in December was 2,370 yuan, and it rose to 2,430 yuan. The opening price in January hit the limit up. Suddenly, it rose by as much as 100 yuan. The second market was open, and the markets in November and December also hit the limit up. In the afternoon, rumors spread, and the factory orders could not be delivered, and the people in the futures yarn market became more and more panicked. More short positions were added, and the market price turned sharply downward. The prices of near-term and long-term futures all hit the limit down. The difference between one rise and one fall reached as much as 200 yuan. Such a volatile market is chaotic, and its trend is even more difficult to predict. A list is provided below.</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Differ in the Morning and Evening</h3>
<p>The current situation of cotton: the price rose in the morning following the silk market, but in the afternoon, the momentum was weak due to negative news and the fall in gold prices.</p>
<p>US-grown Pengjiabore 100 pieces 778.0 No. home</p>
<p>Langgonghua 100 pieces 58.02 again</p>
<p>Another 200 pieces 577.0 again</p>
<p>Another 100 pieces 81.0 again</p>
<p>Another 100 pieces 580.0 again</p>
<p>Another 200 pieces 572.0 again</p>
<p>Fire Machine Grass Bag 500 pieces 500.0 again</p>
<p>The New York cotton market rose because of Washington political news reports that the Senate had passed the 100% 1942 and 1943 New Loan Cotton Act. Speculators and Southern gangs bought in, or short positions were covered, all of which were active and fierce. As a result, the closing price rose by about 27 to 50 pounds more than the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market was closed yesterday due to a bank holiday. It is also predicted that the opening price today will rise by 4 rupees compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Expected to Weaken Further</h3>
<p>Foreign rice prices rose in the morning but fell in the afternoon, with a further decline in the evening. The morning market continued the previous day's upward trend, with some blindly absorbing supplies and sellers raising prices. Speculators, seeing gold prices rising again, became even more active, causing both small and No. 2 Saigon rice to rise to $157-158, and No. 1 Saigon to $173.50. However, after the market price reached its peak, it was reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) was selling small quantities of rice at a flat price, with confirmed continued transactions. Furthermore, there were rumors of favorable exchange rates for supplying goods and flour, and even more bearish rumors. Consequently, those with profits were the first to sell, and large traders also took the opportunity to sell at high prices. In addition, speculative traders followed the trend, causing the market to suddenly decline. Small grain rice plummeted by $8-9, with the afternoon price falling to $149, and continuing to weaken, hovering between $148-149. The overall sentiment was still bearish. Total transactions were less than 20,000 bags. The British firm Inges opened at $181.50 to $180.05 for small grain rice, with an estimated 300-400 tons traded. Currently, the total inventory in various warehouses is 987,771 bags, a decrease of 66,855 bags compared to the previous period.</p>
<p>The supply of thick and thin new polished Japonica rice continues to be scarce, with normal retail sales. Prices continue to increase by $2-3. Early-harvested Southern Harbor rice is quoted at $183-180, Kunshan new Japonica at $181-180, and Qingjiao kiln rice and Fengjing rice are all at $180. Wild rice and Du Jian rice are scarce and there is no market. Glutinous rice remains in short supply, with Hong Kong white glutinous rice priced at $185-186, Zhongguan at $183-180, and Glutinous Lu at $173.50-173, an increase of $1-2 or so.</p>
<h3>Incessant Shipments of Foreign Flour to Tianjin</h3>
<p>The foreign flour market was still stable in the morning, as the public sale was inevitable and rumors were bearish. The market gradually weakened. In the afternoon, due to the sharp fall in rice prices and low gold prices, coupled with warnings, those with profits were eager to sell. Large traders and speculators also rushed to sell, causing the market to immediately reverse and decline. Fort Brand opened at $45.50-45.60 in the morning, but the closing price in the afternoon fell to $44.50. Golden Dragon was $44.70-44.50 in the morning, but fell to $43.30 in the afternoon, a sharp drop of $1.40-1.50 compared to the previous market. At the same time, there were speculators selling wheat bran, but there were few buyers. The previous night's off-market price of $46 had already been reduced by $2 in an attempt to sell.</p>
<p>The Jardine Matheson's ship "Fosheng" is sailing from Shanghai to Tianjin today. In addition to 2,900 bags of foreign flour transported from Hong Kong and transshipped to Tianjin, another 9,600 bags of flour were loaded in this city and transported to Tianjin. (Reported by Zu)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the edible oil market first rose and then fell. Initially, due to the continued rise in cotton yarn and gold, oil speculators continued to absorb supplies and raise prices, pushing the price up by another $3-5. Subsequently, the rise in Japanese military scrip suddenly stopped and reversed, and there were unfavorable rumors, causing a sudden decline in confidence, resulting in a sharp fall. As a result, prices fell by $7-8 compared to the previous day. The total market sales included 200 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 60 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, another 40 barrels of soybean oil, 100 cans of Yantai soybean oil, 200 cans of Jiangbei raw oil, nearly 1,000 loads of Qing oil from the Dayou factory, and 2,500 loads of vegetable oil from various factories.</p>
<h3>Sudden Rise in Domestic Bonds - Mixed Fluctuations in Foreign Bonds</h3>
<p>The off-market trading of public bonds was extremely chaotic yesterday. Rumors of a certain kind of "atmosphere" boosted public bonds, and at the same time, there was a rumor that the Sino-British economic agreement had been signed in Hong Kong. For a time, demand exceeded supply. Class C bonds opened at $7.30, an improvement of 20 cents compared to the previous day. At the close, it was raised to over $8, a sudden increase of nearly $1. The opening price in the afternoon was also stable, and it fell back slightly to $7.15. Afterwards, it broke through $8 and was raised to $9. As a result, market prices all rose sharply by $1 to $1.80. The prices of Class C and E bonds were originally equal, but now there is a difference of $1. The total number of transactions was approximately $2.67 million. A brief table is listed below.</p>

<h3>Resumption of Sugar Futures Trading - Wild Rise and Sharp Fall</h3>
<p>Sugar futures trading has resumed, with prices initially rising and then falling, with significant fluctuations, reaching as much as $20 or more. The sugar industry has always had the reputation of being a "gentleman," but since speculators have become involved, the gentlemanly status has disappeared. The opening price for Company Futures 24 coarse white sugar for late October was $250, the closing price was $62, the highest was $67, and the lowest was $50. Off-exchange trading was at $62.

HHX mark was $251, $253, in the afternoon $240, down $1-2 or so. It is said that the reason for the reversal was also due to a certain "atmosphere," which is why the changes were so drastic.</p>
<p>The northward transport of granulated sugar is incessant. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's "Liangzhou" ship transported more than 20,000 bags from this city, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. Today, the Jardine Matheson's "Fosheng" ship, sailing from Shanghai to Tianjin, also loaded 3,500 bags of granulated sugar in this city.</p>
<h3>Increased Prices for Assorted Dried Lychees</h3>

<h3>French Tram and Electricity Company Announces Electricity Fee Reduction - Setting an Example Amidst Soaring Prices - A Small Amount, But Worthy of Emulation by All Industries - The Price Control Plan May Be Approved Next Week</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of controlling prices in this city, the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC), based on the resolution of a special meeting, requested the Consular Body to approve a new clause to the Land Regulations, authorizing the SMC to formulate regulations regarding the management of retail prices of essential goods, in order to control speculation and profiteering. According to information obtained by a reporter from the Dachung News Agency, the leading consul, Hill, is currently soliciting opinions from consuls of various countries. The Japanese consul, Horinouchi Kansei, has already expressed his agreement. At the same time, the SMC has also begun preparations to organize a legitimate management agency, so that after obtaining the approval of the Consular Body, it can announce the measures for managing prices next week and put them into practice.</p>
<p>New Regulations on Electricity Fees in the French Concession</p>
<p>The French Tram and Electricity Company in the French Concession of this port had modestly increased the fees for trams and other vehicles within the concession since the first of this month. However, yesterday the company officially announced that, starting from November 1st, it will reduce electricity fees for lighting and power in the French Concession by 7% to 10%, so that its prices are the same as those used between August 1st and September 30th. However, the prices of water, trams, trolleybuses, and public bus tickets will remain unchanged. The prices that took effect on the first of this month will continue to be valid. The new electricity prices are listed below: (1) Lighting fees will be reduced from 60 cents to 56 cents per kilowatt-hour (KWH). (2) Electric heating will be reduced from 37 cents to 34 cents per KWH. (3) Power installations above 10 horsepower will be reduced from 39 cents to 36 cents per KWH. (4) Power installations below 10 horsepower will be reduced from 38 cents to 35 cents per KWH. The water fee will remain at 34 cents per cubic meter. Public transport fares will remain as they are. Amidst the current soaring prices, the French water company can still modestly reduce prices. Although the amount is very small, the spirit of its implementation is worthy of emulation by other industries. It is hoped that other industries will not be blinded by greed, disregard the public interest, and frequently raise prices. According to reliable sources, the content of the new clause submitted by the SMC to the Consular Body is roughly divided into three or four items, focusing on essential goods designated by the authorities (such as rice and imported wheat), and setting the maximum retail price to prevent speculation and profiteering. If the violator is Chinese, the SMC will exercise its authority to implement investigations, transfer the case to the First Special District Court for punishment, and revoke their business license. If the violator is a foreigner enjoying extraterritorial rights, the SMC, in accordance with the Land Regulations, may entrust the consular office of the violator's country to impose penalties, in addition to revoking the business license. The SMC will also formulate penalty rules based on the new clause of the Land Regulations, imposing severe punishments on anyone who deliberately raises prices, in order to effectively suppress and stabilize prices.</p>
<p>Separate Implementation of Flour Control</p>
<p>According to information obtained by a reporter from the Dachung News Agency, the SMC has now adopted a new measure to manage prices, in order to control flour prices. It is said that it will be implemented within a few days. Yesterday, a spokesman for the SMC refused to comment on the flour market situation, but stated that the SMC has considered a plan to control the transportation and sale of flour, and stated that it is different from the plan to manage rice prices. It is said that this plan was suggested a month ago and was decided to be implemented this week. The SMC hopes that this move will completely control flour prices within the concession. However, this plan will be implemented separately and will not be included in the management of other prices.</p>
<p>The Bureau's Request Will Eventually Be Approved</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that authoritative sources recently stated that the Consular Body is carefully considering and studying the price control proposal submitted by the SMC at the beginning of this week. Although it has not been confirmed by all parties, the Bureau believes that the members of the Consular Body are all considering how much authority should be granted to the SMC in this situation. Initially, it was rumored that the proposal could be approved within a few days, but in the current situation, it is expected to be approved in a week. In any case, the Consular Body will eventually grant the SMC special powers to manage prices. However, the technical procedures for accepting this proposal are extremely complicated. The Consular Body may hold a special meeting to make a final decision on this matter. The question of whether the SMC will establish an agency to implement the new price management policy, or whether the SMC will directly manage it, will also be decided at the same time.</p>
<p>Consular Court Still Needs to Study It</p>
<p>The English-language "North China Daily News" reported that responsible individuals recently told reporters that the SMC's request to the Consular Body for authorization to manage prices in the International Settlement will have far-reaching consequences. Therefore, all members of the Consular Body must thoroughly study this matter. Some consuls may need to report to their embassies or national governments before they can reply. In any case, the clause drafted by the SMC and submitted to the Consular Body for approval must be studied by the consular court here in order to determine whether it will affect treaty rights in China.</p>
<p>Retailers Actually Restricting Sales</p>
<p>Since the speculative markets for various daily necessities, such as cloth, gold, and cotton yarn, have soared, the threat to the lives of citizens has become increasingly serious. In addition to the sharp increase in selling prices, there is also a situation of restricting purchases. Yesterday, a reporter witnessed a sauce shop limiting each person to a maximum purchase of one catty of cooking oil, refusing to sell more. Also, a cigarette paper shop only allowed the purchase of four bars of soap. In fact, the supply of these items is not lacking, and it is purely a matter of these stores hoarding goods in order to achieve their manipulative aims. The citizens are unaware of this and are becoming alarmed. Therefore, it is earnestly hoped that the concession authorities will severely punish them.</p>
<h3>Argentine Merchant Ship Arrives with 30,000 Bales of Cotton</h3>
<p>The Argentine merchant ship S.S. Norte, after being delayed in coming to Shanghai, is now expected to arrive at this port from Saitu Port on the morning of the 25th (today). After entering the port, it will berth at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. The ship is carrying 30,000 bales of cotton, all of which will be unloaded in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>British Residents Donate to the Soviet Red Cross</h3>
<p>After a meeting of the executive committee of the Shanghai British Central War Fund, a check for 75,000 yuan in Chinese currency was delivered to the manager of the Shanghai Moscow National Bank for remittance to the General Association of the Soviet Red Cross. The bank manager accepted the check and expressed his deep gratitude to the British residents in Shanghai and their friends for their donations.</p>
<h3>Most Rice Shops in the French Concession Refuse to Sell Flat-Priced Rice</h3>
<p>Some Rice Shops Only Sell a Maximum of Five Dou, Raising Prices and Hoarding in the Market to Wait for Higher Prices</p>
<p>The flat-priced foreign rice procured by the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) and distributed by various rice shops in this city has benefited the common people. However, some rice merchants who are blinded by profit have either mixed it with other rice for sale or sold it in short measures, deceiving the citizens. The police authorities have discovered and punished them according to law. Until recently, as rice prices have risen frequently, these rice merchants have been whimsical and dared to violate the law, selling the flat-priced foreign rice at high prices in the market in an attempt to obtain illegal profits. This has now been confirmed in various cases. A reporter also learned from various sources that most rice shops in the French Concession refused to sell the flat-priced rice to residents, claiming that it had already been sold out. Yesterday (the 23rd), a certain resident prepared funds to buy flat-priced rice, but was refused a supply. Some rice shops agreed to sell, but limited the sale to five dou. The authorities' distribution of flat-priced rice is intended to relieve the hardship of ordinary people, and will not allow any illegal merchants to monopolize and hide the rice, harming people's livelihoods. It is hoped that the French authorities will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>The Originally Scheduled President Ship to Sail to Shanghai is Temporarily Recalled - This Suspension is Not Permanent</h3>
<p>According to the situation yesterday (the 24th), it seems uncertain whether the ships of the American President Lines will arrive in Shanghai in the future. It is said that at least five President ships were expected to arrive in Shanghai between now and November 15, but they will not arrive at this port according to the usual schedule.</p>
<p>The General Ship Will Not Come to Shanghai</p>
<p>These five ships are the President Tyler, President Van Buren, and President Madison, as well as the General Pershing and General Holbrook. These two General ships were formerly the President Cleveland and President Taft and have now been converted into U.S. Army transport ships. It is said that this time they are only sailing to Manila, and the remaining three ships, which were originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai, will not come.</p>
<p>Three President Ships Have Been Recalled</p>
<p>Among them, the President Tyler, on its return journey from Singapore, originally intended to come to Shanghai to return to the United States. It is now learned that after arriving in Hong Kong, it will return to the United States. The whereabouts of President Van Buren and President Madison are currently unknown. An employee of the President Lines here said that they had telegraphed the President Lines in Manila to inquire about the details of the two President ships being recalled. However, Manila replied that the information was also unknown. It was learned that President Madison was recalled after sailing 1,400 miles into the sea from Honolulu. The ship was carrying 100 overseas Chinese who had been expelled from Panama before the recent coup, and all intended to come to Shanghai. It is also said that President Van Buren and President Madison were originally scheduled to carry a large number of passengers, cargo, and mail to Shanghai, but have now also been recalled by the authorities. Also, the President Harrison has sailed from San Francisco to the Far East, but it is unknown whether it will sail to Shanghai. According to official sources this morning,</p>
<p>The Suspension is Only Temporary</p>
<p>The current suspension of American ships to Shanghai is only temporary and will last until November 15. It is impossible to say whether it will resume after that. It is also said that the U.S. government has designated Shanghai as part of the occupied area, and all American goods shipped to Shanghai must obtain a special license. However, the inventory of American goods in Shanghai is extremely abundant, and the goods are still being shipped in an endless stream, even though special licenses are required. When shipping is unblocked, there will be continued supply.</p>
<h3>This Year's Overseas Remittances Have Exceeded 800 Million</h3>
<p>In order to encourage overseas Chinese to invest heavily in national construction, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Overseas Department of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission have jointly organized the Overseas Chinese Investment Guidance Committee. Overseas Chinese remittances should be handled centrally by the Central Bank. Overseas Chinese remittances handled by various banks should be resold to the Central Bank to facilitate remittance policy. The funds invested by overseas Chinese in national construction will be guaranteed by the government for the safety of their principal and interest, and will be rewarded, such as exemption from donations and taxes. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from the National Bank yesterday that overseas Chinese remittances to Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guiyang, Guangzhou, Fujian and other places from overseas Chinese to invest in industries and open factories have exceeded 800 million yuan this year. It is expected that it will exceed 1 billion yuan by the end of this year. Moreover, all donations, etc., are not included, which is a great contribution to the country.</p>
<h3>Export Licenses Required for Goods Shipped to Burma - Apply to the British Consulate</h3>
<p>The British Embassy in China recently issued a statement stating that commercial goods shipped from Shanghai to Burma will be subject to new regulations starting from November 1st. Exported to Burma of goods, all vessels, loading of dyed cotton fabrics, dyeing raw materials, chemicals, pigments, Western medicine and medicinal materials, as well as belonging to medicinal village items, paints and colors, must obtain a license. This license can be applied for from the British Consul General in Shanghai. However, the new regulations do not apply before November 1st and goods can still be freely shipped.</p>
<h3>YMCA Appeals for Donations of Winter Clothing for the Poor - Target of 30,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>In recent years, due to the impact of rising prices, the number of poor people starving and freezing to death in winter has increased year by year. Since the YMCA organized a campaign to solicit winter clothing for the poor last year, it has decided to continue to hold a fundraising campaign for winter clothing for the poor due to the above reasons, with a target of 30,000 yuan. Yesterday, the YMCA sent letters to all sectors stating that winter is approaching, and the suffering of the poor women and children who are suffering from hunger and cold is deeply regrettable. The YMCA is soliciting winter clothing donations of 30,000 yuan, as well as a large number of clothes and bedding. It is hoped that benevolent men and women from all walks of life will donate generously, and the merits will be immeasurable. (No external fundraising, and a formal receipt will be issued for each item received.) The receiving address is the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge.</p>
<p>Ningbo Provides Congee</p>
<p>After the fall of Ningbo, the Buddhist Benevolent Society, believing that the starving and cold were lamentable, decided to raise funds and provide congee after a meeting. It entrusted the Jin Cheng Bank, Si Ming Bank, and Guonen Temple at Eight Immortals Bridge to collect donations. Once a certain amount has been collected, personnel will be sent to Ningbo to start the process.</p>
<p>Help the Salvation Army</p>
<p>Someone recently visited the Salvation Army and learned that it has no fixed assets in Shanghai, so they donated 10,000 yuan in foreign currency. They deeply hope that wealthy Chinese can provide practical assistance and make contributions. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency quoted Major Hawke, the leader of the army, as saying yesterday that they do not intend to promote a donation movement. If anyone is willing to donate land, property, or money, they will plan to build a house so that all Salvation Army affairs can be promoted.</p>
<h3>Gold Bond Interest Payments to Begin at the End of This Month</h3>
<p>After the War Bonds Fundraising Committee launched a total mobilization to launch a bond fundraising movement, people across the country and overseas Chinese responded enthusiastically and exceeded the planned amount. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from the Central Bank yesterday that the third interest payment for the first issue and the second interest payment for the second issue of the 29th Year of the Republic Construction Gold Bonds in this fundraising will be paid. The interest on the British gold bonds is 250,000 pounds, and the interest on the U.S. gold bonds is 1.25 million U.S. dollars. The Ministry of Finance has transferred these funds to the Central Bank for special storage from the national treasury revenue account, according to the British gold and U.S. dollar amounts specified in the principal and interest repayment schedule. Payments will be made by the Central Bank and its entrusted banks starting on October 31st, according to the type of bond, in installments. The British gold bonds will be paid in British gold, and the U.S. gold bonds will be paid in U.S. dollars. It is also stipulated that the drawing of lots for principal repayment will begin next year. Each will be repaid in 25 years, with a drawing of lots every six months, which will be carried out by the Fund Management Committee three months before each period.</p>
<h3>The Asia Oil Depot in Changsha Was Bombed and Destroyed - There Was No Oil Stored in the Depot</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reported yesterday (the 23rd) that according to visitors from Changsha, the Asia Oil Company's oil depot in Changsha was bombed by Japanese aircraft. When they left Changsha at the end of September, Japanese troops had not yet invaded the city, but had launched a fierce air raid. They witnessed Japanese aircraft dive-bombing the Asia Oil Depot. The oil depot was in a remote location across the river. Because there was no oil stored in it, it had not been used for a long time. The Japanese aircraft dropped a large bomb that landed between the oil tanks. One oil tank was destroyed, and three were heavily damaged. Four bombs hit the warehouse and burned it down. The oil depot's power supply was also destroyed, and several other buildings and equipment of the Asia Company were also slightly damaged.</p>
<p>SMC Chinese Staff Rice Subsidy</p>

<h3>The Yangtze River Dredging Project is Completed - The Jianshe Ship Returned to the Huangpu River the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>The large dredger "Jianshe" of the Shanghai Pudong Dredging Bureau has completed all its work in the Yangtze River area since it was sent there by the Bureau at the beginning of this year. The ship sailed into the Huangpu River the day before yesterday morning and docked on the Huangpu River opposite the Xin Kai River in the French Concession. Because the work has lasted for a long time, the hull has been slightly damaged, so workers have been hired to repair and paint it.</p>
<h3>French Tram Workers Demand a Wage Increase</h3>
<p>It is learned that the French Tram Workers' Union requested the company on the 23rd of this month to increase wages by $50 across the board, with $20 for housing and $30 for living allowances. The monthly salary of the company's coolies has already exceeded $135. Moreover, wage increases often stimulate price increases. The best solution is for the concession authorities to suppress general prices, which can reduce all labor disputes.</p>
<h3>Rongwu Society's Sutra Lecture</h3>
<p>The 26th Sutra Lecture of the Rongwu Sutra Society will be held at the original clock time of 3:00 pm and the new clock time of 4:00 pm on the 16th, still on the fourth floor of the China Vocational Education Society's Biler Hall. Listeners should arrive on time.</p>
<h3>Rampant Pirates at the Mouth of the Song River: Victims Rescued by Foreign Ship Captain Arrive in Shanghai; Twelve Ships Have Been Affected in the Past Few Months</h3>
<p>Pirates are rampant near Wusong, specializing in robbing fishing boats and merchant ships, making it their source of livelihood. In the past month, more than twelve ships have been affected. Recently, similar incidents have occurred again. According to a foreign ship captain, he rescued dozens of merchants and passengers who had been subjected to the pirates' violence on his way from the mouth of the Song River to Shanghai. He said that when his ship reached sixty nautical miles from the mouth of the Song River, he heard cries for help. Although he did not understand Chinese, he knew that the passengers were in danger based on the situation. At that time, a group of pirates were threatening a small merchant ship not far from Wusong. The affected passengers cried for help to his ship, asking it to stop moving forward. Dozens of passengers, half-naked, jumped from the small boat, shouting loudly. The captain, disregarding the consequences, and seeing that the ship was damaged and without oars, threw ropes, allowing them to climb aboard. Then he brought them to Shanghai, and tied the small boat to the foreign ship. According to the captain, he wanted to cut the ropes and not bring the small boat, but after the passengers' cries, he carried some passengers on the small boat, and the sailors also came along. When they arrived in Wusong, many thanked the captain for his chivalry. Because of the captain's rescue, none of the passengers on the small boat were killed, only silver, money, and goods were lost, and the small boat was slightly damaged.</p>

<h3>The Owner of Yuchang Cotton Shop Arrested for Privately Hiding a Handgun</h3>
<p>Confiscated from a Patrolman of the Public Concession. Shop owner Ye Bingsheng has been arrested pending investigation.</p>
<p>Yuchang Cotton Shop, Room 529, 5th Floor, Central Bank Building, Edward Road, is owned by Ye Bingsheng (44 years old this year) from Jiangyin. On the surface, it operates a legitimate cotton business, but in reality, it specializes in buying stolen goods of various kinds. Yesterday at 1:00 AM, the French police received a tip-off that the shop was hiding firearms. They immediately dispatched detectives to search the premises and found a handgun in the writing desk drawer. They immediately took the gun and the shop owner Ye Bingsheng into custody for questioning. It was later found that the handgun privately hidden by Ye was the official handgun of a patrolman in the Public Concession who had been robbed. Because Ye was suspected and the case was serious and the inside situation was complicated, the French police informed the Public Concession Police Department at 10:00 AM, and detectives from the Old Zha police station brought Ye and the handgun back.</p>
<h3>Extortion of 50,000 Yuan: Arrest and Trial Concluded</h3>
<p>Huang Taisheng, who resides at No. 300, Shanhai Pass Road, has been studying in Hong Kong. Only his sister, Huang Suzhen, remains at home in Shanghai. From the 23rd of last month to the 9th of this month, Huang successively received six extortion letters, impersonating the name of a certain troop, signed by Zhao Hanming, stating that due to lack of funds, he specially requested a loan of 50,000 yuan. A bullet was attached to the letter, instructing him to make contact next to the Chen Yingshi Memorial Tower on Ximen Road in the South City. The person making contact would be carrying a beer bottle. Huang immediately reported the situation to the News Police Station, and dispatched Chinese Detective Wang Runhe and Detective Chen Baozhong. On the 9th of this month, they, together with local military police, went to wait and caught Xu Ziming (also known as He De) from Suzhou. They took him to the command headquarters and transferred him to the police station the day before yesterday. They searched Xu Ziming's home and found two bottles of ink and an inkpad, and ordered him to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case, saying that the defendant confessed in the police station that the case was initiated by Zhang Haiming, who is at large, and that the six extortion letters were written by the defendant alone. When Xu Ziming was questioned, he confessed everything. Judge Zhong verified the confession and ordered him to be detained until the 29th, when the verdict would be announced at a later date.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Issues High-Denomination Revenue Stamps</h3>
<p>The various revenue stamps previously issued by the Ministry of Finance had low face values. If a large amount of tax was required, several stamps had to be affixed to make up the amount, which was not economical. Recently, the Ministry has printed three types of revenue stamps with denominations of ten yuan, twenty yuan, and one hundred yuan.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: According to the statement of the person concerned, Weng Yuquan, I have read the news item "Pawnshop Owner Embezzles Pledgor's Jewelry" in the local news column of the Shenbao on the 23rd of this month. The details recorded therein are completely inconsistent with the facts. According to Zeng Kefu, the gold ring in dispute had a small amount of the outer layer of the joint cut off, and it was mentioned that it had been sold to a jewelry store. The news item stated that Yuquan "actually cut off a small amount of the inner layer of the joint (old style) of the gold ring and sold it to a jewelry store." This record is obviously unfounded. As the case has already been litigated, the right and wrong can originally be quietly awaited the court's decision. However, for fear of confusing the public, I should entrust you to forward it to the newspaper for correction. Accordingly, I am forwarding it on behalf of the person concerned, and I hope you will investigate and correct it. Sincerely, To the Editor of Shenbao, Lawyer Shen E, October 24.</p>

<h3>Thefts in Shanghai (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Bai Min</p>
<p>Criminals occasionally carry large quantities of stolen goods to the interior for sale. If the police receive news of the sale of stolen goods in the interior, they immediately send a detective to cooperate with local police officers to arrest the criminals and those who receive the stolen goods. Before the war, criminals often gathered in Hongkou. After a robbery, they would cross the bridge to Hongkou or Zhabei to sell the stolen goods. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, pawnshops and receivers of stolen goods moved to the south of the Suzhou Creek, and the center for selling stolen goods also moved south.</p>
<p>The police often use the method of detectives posing as receivers of stolen goods to catch the criminals who sell the stolen goods on the spot. When a detective posing as a receiver of stolen goods is working, he first sets a date with a third party who is close to the criminals' activities. If the criminal arrives on time, he will be arrested by other detectives disguised as workers and lurking nearby. When the trial begins, the criminal has no way to deny it and has to confess, suffering the taste of prison. However, clever criminals often guard against falling into this trap, so they first send a representative, without carrying the stolen goods, to the scene alone. The detective has no way to start and can only pretend to negotiate, while quietly waiting for the opportunity to mature. Only when the criminal believes that it is safe and shows the stolen goods will the detectives act to wipe out the gang of criminals.</p>
<p>Some criminals' activities are quite similar to those of Western criminal gangs. They often belong to a criminal gang and use third parties to sell stolen goods, giving them a commission after the transaction is completed. Sometimes criminals hide the stolen goods for many months, thinking that the police investigation has slackened, before contacting the receivers of stolen goods or pawnshops to sell the stolen goods. However, most of them are still solved, because when a detective is assigned to investigate a case, he always pays attention. Even after many months or even years, he can still arrest the criminals and bring them to justice.</p>
<p>The rampant theft in Shanghai is also related to the carelessness of most citizens. Few citizens remember the correct value and detailed characteristics of the stolen property to help the police conduct investigations. Failure to report a robbery is also an important reason for the frequent occurrence of robberies. The close cooperation between the Public Concession Police Department and the French Concession Police Department in investigating and arresting criminals has achieved good results. Whenever a robbery occurs, as long as there are sufficient clues, it is not difficult to solve it in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Two More Bombs Were Thrown at the Grain Exchange Yesterday; Did Not Explode and Were Removed by the Police</h3>
<p>The Grain and Oil Cake Exchange at No. 15 Edward Road, French Concession, had a young man pretend to bend down to tie his shoelaces in front of the gate on the 4th of this month, then placed two paper-wrapped hand grenades and walked away. There was also a letter attached. Fortunately, it was discovered early and did not explode. Unexpectedly, not long after, at about 4:30 PM yesterday, another man in his thirties, wearing a black long gown, carried two rectangular paper packages. When passing in front of the gate, he suddenly threw the two paper packages into the iron gate. They did not explode. The janitors and guards of the exchange saw it and knew that something was wrong. They expected that there must be dangerous items inside and did not dare to go forward to inspect them. At that time, the exchange inside the building was still noisy with buying and selling, disturbing the ears. Upon hearing the news, they immediately ceased operations and quickly called the French police. A large number of detectives rushed to the scene and immediately dispersed the crowd in the area, trying to open the two paper packages. It turned out that they were two hand grenades, and another letter was attached. They were all taken back to the police station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Assassin of White Russian Society Chairman Arrested</h3>
<p>The English-language North China Daily News reports that the Japanese have arrested a Chinese in the South City and confiscated a handgun, the model of which is the same as the gun used to assassinate Ivanoff, the former chairman of the White Russian Committee in this city, and to assassinate Japanese soldiers in Hongkou in recent months. The case is currently being handled jointly by Major Hayashi of the Japanese Military Police and the Public Concession Police Department. It is reported that the arrested Chinese was caught by nearby Japanese sentries in the South City two days ago when he tried to assassinate someone. The confiscated handgun and bullets are the same as those found in the assassination of Ivanoff on September 25 and the assassination of Japanese sentry Nishida in July. It is widely believed that the arrested Chinese has confessed to terrorist activities. Therefore, it is expected that the Japanese and the Public Concession authorities will soon carry out a large-scale arrest.</p>
<h3>Two Women Detained in Baokang Lane, Avenue Joffre</h3>
<p>At about 2:30 AM yesterday, the Japanese sent a plainclothes team to the French police station, requesting to cooperate in dispatching additional personnel to arrest two Guangdong women, Ms. Guo and Ms. Cui, at No. 68 Baokang Lane, Avenue Joffre, one in her fifties and the other in her thirties. They searched their room for more than an hour, and a large number of photos and letters were taken away. It is reported that Ms. Cui does not live here and only lodged at Ms. Guo's place two days ago. The cause of this incident may be related to the arrest of a Cantonese man surnamed Wang at No. 19 Dunhe Lane, Route Tenant de la Tour, by the Japanese and French police at about 8:30 PM the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Yuchengtaili Rice Shop Arrests Four or Five People for Altering the Public Works Department’s Low-Priced Rice and Selling it at High Prices to Defraud Money</h3>
<p>The price of rice in this city's rice market has soared due to the manipulation and monopoly of rice merchants and hoarders, putting an unbearable burden on the common people. Fortunately, the Public Works Department has taken appropriate measures to severely punish rice weevils and directly purchase foreign rice for sale at low prices. The price of rice was once stabilized. However, the rice weevils only know how to enrich themselves and disregard the hardships of the people. They do not hesitate to use various methods to undermine the authorities' good policies. Recently, some people have been hiding the low-priced foreign rice they obtained from the Public Works Department without selling it, and privately altering it to sell at high prices, while making false reports to the Public Works Department, falsely claiming that the rice they obtained has been completely sold. This kind of behavior that eats people without spitting out their bones is truly outrageous. The Old Zha police station recently discovered that Yuchengtaili Rice Shop at No. 8 Fujian Road (Zhengjia Wood Bridge), has been altering the appearance of the Public Works Department's low-priced rice and selling it at high prices. Therefore, Chinese Detective Ji Peijin went to search the premises the day before yesterday morning and took the person in charge, Mr. Lu, and four or five others into custody for questioning. However, they were not sent to the First Special District Court yesterday morning. It is reported that the police authorities are currently conducting a thorough and detailed investigation into the case. Once the evidence is collected, they will file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court according to the law.</p>

<h3>Unveiling of the Free Talk Essay Contest, Part 6: One Knows the Difficulty Only After Experiencing It - Lin - A Lesson I Learned -</h3>
<p>In these days of rice as pearls and firewood as cinnamon, we barely managed to hire a nanny. Besides buying groceries and cooking, she also had to wash the clothes of five people. These tasks were already enough to overwhelm her, so there was no time for her to tidy up the rooms. As a result, dust accumulated more and more in our rooms. Spiderwebs covered the ceiling, the glass windows were so dirty that almost no light could pass through, and the walls were covered with patches. I really couldn't stand it anymore and asked myself, "Are these things only for the nanny to do? I also have two hands, why don't I do it myself?" Fortunately, it's summer vacation now, and I have a lot of time to work. Good! I decided to do it myself.</p>
<p>My first step was to prepare to whitewash the ceiling. So, I went to the street to buy a package of "Lao Fen" (a type of whitewash powder) and mixed it with water. Who knew that after a while, the "Lao Fen" would quickly settle, and the water and powder would separate clearly. I knew that it wouldn't be that simple to succeed. So I went to a "whitewashing workshop" to inquire and learned that it wouldn't work without adding glue. I bought some glue there. I tried it at home, and it was indeed effective. The water and powder mixed evenly, and I couldn't see any more settling. At that time, I was very happy, thinking that I would be able to proceed smoothly. Who knew that the first stroke with the powder would cause a problem. Not only did it not whiten, but it even became darker with each stroke. It turned out that I had forgotten to wipe off the dust first. The white powder, of course, wouldn't whiten when it encountered dust. Helpless, I had to go to the street again to buy a new broom to brush off the dust and cobwebs. This time, I wasn't fooled. If I used an old broom, wouldn't I just be adding another layer of dirt? With great difficulty, the ceiling was whitewashed, but I was covered in sweat. My face and body seemed to have been whitewashed as well. I couldn't help but laugh when I looked in the mirror. It turned out I looked like a "little painted face" on the stage. This success, although it suffered some setbacks, aroused my interest and courage in future work.</p>
<p>The second step was to prepare to wipe the glass windows and walls. It seemed easy, but the glass that hadn't been wiped for a long time made me work hard. Climbing up and down the ladder with a wiping cloth, carrying a lead bucket to change the water again and again, using a dry cloth for a while and a wet cloth for a while, I was having a great time. It took a lot of effort to wipe all fifty-eight panes of glass clean in one go.</p>
<p>The third step was to prepare to paint the floor. I ran to the "paint shop" to ask how to paint it well. How is paint made? Of course, when asking, you can't look arrogant, you have to be humble. Very smoothly, the painter very politely told me everything and taught me to buy some shellac (solid) in the paint shop, then soak it in alcohol until it dissolves. I thanked him and went to buy four jiao worth of shellac for experimentation. When I got home, I poured some kerosene and put the shellac inside. Who knew that after waiting for a long time, the kerosene was still kerosene, and the shellac was still shellac. The hateful shellac showed no sign of dissolving at all. Just when I was puzzled, my father came over and scolded me slightly. "What a mess you've made on the floor." Uncle Xiang also came over and said, "You can't paint the floor yourself, you'll only make a mess." I had nothing to say because what I was doing wasn't working! At that time, I didn't want to stop my work. I believed that the amiable painter would never deceive me. So I went to the paint shop for the second time to ask the reason for not dissolving. After the painter's instructions, I suddenly realized that I had mistaken kerosene for alcohol. No wonder it wouldn't dissolve. What a waste. This time, I reorganized my troops, with the determination to succeed, I bought enough raw materials, and finally whitewashed my old room, making it look brand new. My father and Uncle Xiang also came to see it. At this time, they had nothing to say.</p>
<p>From this experience, I learned three lessons:</p>
<p>(1) Don't be ashamed to ask questions - Things that I didn't understand at all, I was able to do myself after asking people. One person's knowledge is limited, and one must not be arrogant. You must humbly ask for advice in order to make up for your own shortcomings with the strengths of others.</p>
<p>(2) The spirit of perseverance - The success of a thing is not achieved at once, it often goes through many setbacks. For example, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's leadership of the revolution succeeded only on the tenth attempt. If he had stopped after the first or third failure and resigned himself to failure, where would we be today? Therefore, the spirit of perseverance is a major factor in success.</p>
<p>(3) One knows the difficulty only after experiencing it - Often many things seem easy, but after you do them yourself, you realize that they are difficult. I believe in the saying "One knows the difficulty only after experiencing it."</p>
<p>Natural Natural World's Offense and Defense - Sun Hong -</p>
<p>Many offensive and defensive methods in modern warfare are not surprising, because Mother Nature has already come up with those methods for various animals.</p>
<p>Artillery - A kind of beetle carries a cannon with it, a special scent gland inside its abdomen. When they fire the cannon, they emit a terrible stench and a rumbling sound. It is enough to scare their enemies - reptiles and birds that live by preying - into abandoning their armor and fleeing.</p>
<p>Air Defense Network - According to recent reports, Britain has invented a shell that can shoot out metal filaments after it explodes, hooking onto the propellers of enemy aircraft. A primitive animal in ponds uses the same method to protect itself. When they escape, they release "hook glands," making it impossible for enemies to move.</p>
<p>Smoke Bomb - When cuttlefish are foraging on the ocean surface, if they find an enemy lurking in the dark, they shoot out a black liquid as a smokescreen to cover their retreat. Under the cover of that smokescreen, they escape home and come out again when there is no danger.</p>
<p>Camouflage - There are countless animals in nature that can use camouflage. The tactics of spider crabs are the most ingenious. They collect seaweed, chew it to make it easier to grow, and then attach it to the curved short hairs on their backs. The seaweed then takes root there, effectively concealing the cunning crab.</p>
<p>Parachute - Spiders in our forests or grasslands climb onto a tree and spit out a long, wandering thread. When a breeze blows the thread, it leaves the tree and climbs onto the thread, drifting with the thread. After drifting to the distance it desires, it folds up its parachute and slowly lands.</p>
<p>Air Combat - Fighter planes can repel bombers because of their high speed and ease of use. Hummingbirds, which are native to tropical America, can also use the same method to repel enemies. When giant eagles or other plunderers come to seize their nests, they aim their spear-like beaks at the eyes of the opponent and swoop down to drive away the enemy.</p>
<p>Inventing Eye Masks and Paper Slippers - Yong Yun -</p>
<p>To increase passenger comfort, Northwest Airlines in the United States has recently provided an eye mask. Because after wearing the eye mask, it can avoid bright light stimulating the eyes. This way, you can take a nap, while another passenger sitting next to you can still read, which is convenient for both.</p>
<p>There is also a kind of paper slippers. These slippers are made of a very soft paper, which is cool and light to wear on the feet, which is really a great benefit to passengers.</p>

<p>Fourteen: The Life of a Fallen Hero</p>
<p>"Originally, there was war and chaos at this time, and many shops in Shanghai were closed. Where could you go to a foreign firm to find a job?" The landlady of the small inn, knowing about this, came into Qiu Haitang's room that night and launched into a long speech. "But there are also places where girls can easily find a good match, as long as you open your minds a little and don't take the old sayings that people used to say too seriously. You have to know what kind of world it is now?"</p>
<p>Mei Bao lowered her head, sitting on a fake mahogany chair that had lost its bamboo shoots, silently not saying a word.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your kindness, Madam. We are outsiders in this world, and we must ask you to guide us in everything!" Qiu Haitang replied in a diplomatic tone, but in his heart, he was planning how to go again tomorrow to find a few more acquaintances.</p>
<p>This time, his vision was finally correct. He found Mr. Qian, who worked as an editor in a newspaper. Although this Mr. Qian didn't have such a deep friendship with Qiu Haitang before, he was very generous and always willing to help others. After listening to Qiu Haitang say three or four sentences, he immediately jumped up from his seat, took down the old Qiu Pai cigar that he was holding in his mouth, and said with great excitement:</p>
<p>"Then what else is there to say? Of course, we have to quickly find a way to get a class!"</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang was about to interject, but the old Mr. Qian hurriedly waved his hand to stop him. (245)</p>

<p>Movie Stars Teach Tirelessly - Li Yi -</p>
<p>Some people think that the big stars in Hollywood probably have very big egos! This idea is actually wrong. Many big stars not only humbly accept other people's guidance, but also sincerely teach people. Many of these big stars are actually teachers! No wonder they have the spirit of teaching tirelessly!</p>
<p>Ms. Ann Sheridan, now a first-class star, taught English, mathematics and Spanish at a school in the north for six years before entering the film city. Students deeply loved her. Madeleine Carroll and the red-haired girl Greer Garson were both teachers in England before going to Hollywood in the United States. Their spirit of patient guidance was undoubtedly very popular with students. Rita Hayworth, this brilliant star from Columbia, used to be a dance teacher at a technical school in Hollywood. Her dance skills were already appreciated! Myrna Loy originally ran a dance night school in Culver City for a long time. Many people became famous under her tutelage! Paramount has a star, Louise Campbell, who is a very serious teacher! She said that teaching is the most interesting, and she still wants to be a teacher if she has the opportunity. If a person is lucky enough to have such a beautiful star as their teacher, what an honor it would be! Then the rapid progress of learning is naturally also to be expected!</p>
<p>Little Records of Pear Garden Figures - Zheng Guoyi Biography - Kun Ling Department - Zhang Yizhang - Cartography -</p>
<p>(6) Wang Yurong</p>
<p>Wang Yurong, people say that she started as a song girl in Qinhuai, which is not true. Before she went to Nanjing, she had already used the stage name "Wang Yanfang" and sang in the Shanghai stage for a while, but before she went north to worship Wang Yaoqing, she once showed her beauty in the Qunfang Club in Moling. Yurong's voice is very good - unlike other female roles, who have a thin, sharp, and shrill "ghost voice" - and can be called an excellent choice in today's Kun Ling team. She can also persevere and encourage herself, so she has received a lot of guidance from Wang Yaoqing. In a few years, her art has improved rapidly. However, her Beijing dialect is still not as pure as Zhang Eyun's, which is a shortcoming, but when compared to singing skills, Zhang is slightly inferior to her. - Wang Yaoqing once said to me personally: Although his female disciples are all over the north and south, most of them became famous and then joined his school, so many singing styles, because of the preconceived notions, are difficult to erase, and sometimes they cannot be forced to conform in order to fully conform to Yaoqing's style. Only Wang Yurong learned opera from him, and she has not yet achieved much success, so she can be dedicated and unremitting, and not pursue other things. Compared with other Kun Ling, Wang Yurong can be said to still have one or two points of Yaoqing's true face. From Wang Yaoqing's words, it can also be inferred that Wang Yurong has gained from Yaoqing.</p>
<p>Shanghai's Newest Type of Bookstore - Jian Fan -</p>
<p>The arrangement of bookstores in the Shanghai concessions, such as Huiquanlou, Nanyuan, Huyuan, Yalu, Fuchun, Longquan, Yuminglou, and Fengmingtai, is as simple as the old-fashioned bookstores in the Yemiao area in Nanshi City. For more than ten years, bookstores attached to hotels have sprung up one after another. Only the Oriental Bookstore, which still stands tall, has relatively complete facilities. Nowadays, the Oriental's night show specializes in drama and has been rebuilt into a small theater. Secondly, such as Da Luotian, Nanjing Bookstore, and Baihuating Night Bookstore, which is attached to the new type of teahouse, the seating arrangement in the venue is also very good. Since the Cangzhou Hotel's hall was opened as a bookstore this summer, all the facilities are magnificent and luxurious. The listener feels refreshed when they are in it. However, the Zhangyuan Bookstore, which recently opened, is located in the Coral Hall upstairs, which is beautiful and more complete than Cangzhou. The front and rear glass windows have sufficient light. And like a broadcasting station, there is a cloth cover under the roof to concentrate the sound waves, and a sound amplifier is installed on the desk, so that even the listeners sitting in the last row can hear clearly. It can be said that it fully meets the new type of bookstore in our dreams.</p>
<p>All the storytelling and ballad singing hired by the newly opened bookstores are called "Qinglong Dang" by people in this industry. Zhangyuan's "Qinglong Dang", such as Shen Jian'an and Li Nian'an's Pearl Tower, and Wu Zi'an's Dangerous Tang, I have already talked about in this journal's "Autumn Dang Warriors of Each Bookstore". As for the younger ballad singers Pang Xueting and Xie Hanting's Fallen Golden Fan, both of them are disciples of Jiang Ruting and have considerable accomplishments, as well as Run Yu She's Zhang Jianting and Jianbang's Ten Beauties, are all worth listening to. In the night show, such as Hou Jiuxia and Shen Huiren's Pearl Tower, their singing voice is round and jade-like, and their storytelling is affectionate and reasonable. Liu Tianyun and Xie Yuqing's master and apprentice's Three Smiles, their explanations are delicate and appropriate. Yun Feng's commentary on the Golden Spear Legend is concise and old-fashioned. The last show to send off guests, Lu Fengxiang and Xiao Xiang's father and son's Yu Qiting, is humorous and funny. Isn't it comfortable and interesting to sit in such an elegant and exquisite bookstore for a low price?</p>
<p>Pear Garden Anecdotes - Cun Ren -</p>
<p>Kun Dan Zhao Wanshuang is still staying in Shanghai, and will go to Qingdao to perform in a few days. Although Zheng Bingru has returned north, he will come to Shanghai again around the eighth of next month to participate in a grand hall meeting in a certain mansion in this city.</p>
<p>Zhao Manyun will try out "New Spinning Cotton" tonight for the first time. Because of the urging from all parties, the update has been posted ahead of schedule. Also, Bai Jialin's "Ding Si County", "Zhang Yi Deceives Chu", and "Harvesting Wheat and Pretending to Be a God" will also be performed one after another.</p>
<p>There is a proposal for the Grand Stage to invite Li Wanchun to come to Shanghai to perform during the New Year next year. After the Tan Troupe finishes performing, they will perform "Thirteen Episodes of Gods and Monsters Swordsman Legend", which Ke Zhi is engaged in arranging.</p>
<p>Kun Jiao Qingshan Zhang Huicong will rejoin Leyuan next month to replace Han Suqiu.</p>
<p>Blood Rain Qiong Pa - Gu Daodao -</p>
<p>Chapter 18: Vow to Sweep Away the Huns Regardless of Oneself</p>
<p>So Bai Twelve, on orders, went to Jiukoumen and invited Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei, and also invited Xu Jingliu and Ying, to a secret place, which Bai Twelve had specially arranged, and set up a very rich banquet with the best wine, inviting the four to drink happily. Zhang Cangqiu was a little puzzled to see that Bai Twelve was receiving them so sincerely today. After three rounds of wine, Bai Twelve told the four of Wu Sangui's urgent desire to invite Zhang and others to Beijing to rescue Yuan Yuan, and asked Zhang Cangqiu and others on behalf of Sangui. Xu Jing listened and couldn't help laughing: "Heroes are helpless with affection! When King Chu Shuang was surrounded at Gaixia, he still had to abandon the country, but couldn't let go of Consort Yu. The Gaixia song brought tears to the ages, which cannot be explained. I heard that Chen Yuanyuan is indeed the number one beauty in Jiangnan. General Wu got her, and naturally they are a loving couple, enjoying exclusive favor. Unfortunately, she was taken away by the rebel thief, no wonder the general deeply regrets and hates it, and is reluctant to let go. Returning the pearl to Hepu and the sword leaping in Yanjin, of course, this is what General Wu deeply hopes for. However, it is known that the king has just died, the Divine Land has been lost, and the Ming Dynasty is in a precarious and critical autumn. What should a soldier do to be ready for battle and save the country? When national affairs and private feelings are compared, someone must be able to distinguish the weight and urgency. Now General Wu doesn't hurry to rectify the three armies to fight the bandits, but instead keeps thinking about a woman, isn't it too trivial?" Liu Yinying smiled and said nothing, Zhang Cangqiu shouted: "Brother Bai, it's not that I'm unwilling to comply with your request, but I can't agree to do it in the first place. (201)</p>
