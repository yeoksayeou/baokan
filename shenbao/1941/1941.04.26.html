<p>社評</p>
<h3>防癆運動之成就</h3>
<p>第一屆防癆運動之舉行　參加免費X光檢查之醫院，有二十家，且皆爲私立醫院；低價供給藥品之藥房亦得有十七家；而免費檢驗痰液又得有朱仰高程慕頤等化驗所六家；集新醫藥私人事業、出而爲公衆服務，此種偉大精神，宜寄以深切之同情。蓋醫師之職業爲治病，而醫師最高之任務爲對於公衆指導疾病於未發，使其不病。夫使公衆能小病，或至少病，然後見醫生所貢獻於民族國家社會者至大，斯即中國良相良醫並稱之所由來也。</p>
<p>爲公衆服務至難，一則人衆，二則事繁，三則品羣不齊，四則易爲公衆所不諒，故一不愼，則任勞且須任怨。蓋病態之檢騐至不易，即如X光檢查，尙有非透視所能盡其徵結而窮其源者。况倉卒來診，爲時至暫；痰液化騐，容或不現；於以見防癆運動實有繼續擴大之必要，庶幾根絕於未然，治療於已發，復元於善後，而後造福人羣，成效昭著矣。</p>
<p>然斯非盡私人醫藥業之職責也，尙有賴於公衆方面之協贊。今之含有公立性質之醫院，其服務精神，未能盡愜人意，斤斤於醫藥手術諸費之較量，而病情之緩急有所不暇顧；是轉不若佛敎凈業社仁濟善堂濟生會等數十年施醫給藥之於貧病較爲實惠也。夫出於私人事業，縱其意志高超，勇於爲公，終限於人力財力之有時而窮，未能盡如所願。觀於邇來防癆運動得租界衛生處不斷努力，已在大衆心理上留有預防癘疫之深刻印象：即婦孺亦知一蒼蠅傳染疫徽一之可畏，足爲防疫獲有成效之明證，亦即爲政以德不在以刑之良好實例。蓋所謂政者爲民衆之事，而所謂德者乃爲善意的敎化；刑者待不率敎而後齊之也。今未敎而先之以懲罰，所謂不敎而誅，有司之過，非可歸咎於民衆。故如隨地吐痰，原爲惡習，且爲疾病傳染之媒介，事在應革。但革之之道不在乎罰。或以爲罰可知儆，不罰何以知勸，是亦不然：要知罰固可以示儆，但知畏罰而不爲，非知其不應爲而不爲，則如罰有所疎，舊態復作。蓋今之爲政，不論其爲國爲市，要非民可使由之，不可使知之，而爲民可使知之而可使由之之時期矣。故以爲防癆運動之成功，有賴於廣大切實之宣傳，使大衆瞭然於癆病之害己害人，並指示其就治之道，而予以治療上醫藥之便利；如是行之，假以歲月，癆病縱不能絕，當能去其大半。若以罰吐痰爲可革舊習，非特易於犯禁，而受累者將爲大多數鄉曲無知，是擾民也，非養民也，亦非所謂爲政以德也。蓋德以化成，化則深入民衆，蔚爲風習，而後不待懲罰，翕然從敎矣！</p>
<p>雖然防癆運動，民族强健之運動也。故最有效之防禦，莫如本身體力之抵抗。蓋大氣之中，所含病菌，固不知無量數；一呼一吸之間，侵入於內體者，復不知有多少；世不至人人生癆，亦不至人人皆病，正爲抵抗力强者足以抵抗病菌於無形，弱者乃爲病菌所侵襲，是可知發揮固有之抵抗力，爲防癆最易見效之捷徑；若待其病而後治，已失之於晚。故如何可以培養各人之抵抗力，是亦公共衛生所應注意指導之一大問題也。</p>
<p>抑一切事業之成功，人力爲其主，經費爲其母。癆病之傳染至易，人不能離社會，即不能謂不虞傳染。然未見社會人士對於防癆運動有所贊助也；夫人不求贊助，而贊助之者在人，有經費而後事業之發展愈易。今所期望於公衆者，愼母以防癆爲少數醫藥界事，要爲大衆切身事；應動員大衆之人力財力，撲滅爲害人羣之癆病撩。再則患有癆病者幸自愛，母以之傳染於人，而應自動的善與人隔離。三則未有癆病者幸自攝，母損壞自身之抵抗力，而使病菌易於侵襲。能如是，而知防癆運動事半功倍矣。</p>

<p>美海長諾克斯宣稱　必須履行援英諾言</p>
<p>華盛頓　美國務卿赫爾及海軍部長諾克斯、昨晚宣稱、美國必須覓得方法、使美國援央物品、能抵達其目的地、但兩人並未言及美國海軍之護航、渠兩人參加羅斯福總統戰時閣議後出來時、嚴肅而沉默、其後數小時、即用無綫電廣播演講、渠兩人雖未提及護航、但渠等堅決之措辭、巳顯示渠等相信美國現時應有所舉動、以保證援英物品能抵目的地、諾克斯在紐的報紙出版人宴席上演講、（諾氏本人亦係一出版人），檢討納粹之進行包圍美國、渠稱、德國獨覇世界之奢望巳不復有絲毫疑意、納粹之虎口巳在閉合云、諾氏復概述美國之援英行動、並譴責侵略、渠稱、事已至此、吾人不能退讓、吾人已獻身於此决世界鬥爭、吾人唯有繼續進行、吾人必須有始有終、美國須看淸各項可能之結果、如英國失敗、則美國有被完全包圍之可能、至此、吾人之取採、唯有屈服及決戰二者而巳、吾人必不屈服、吾人決意作戰、凡訖悉美國者、必不對此懷疑、因此吾人若不覓得並實施英國不需吾人作戰而能獲勝之方法、則結果吾人必須作戰云、（二十五日合衆社電）</p>
<p>美海空軍巡邏擴大　遠及大西洋之中部</p>
<p>華盛頓　昨日此間、有連接之迅速發展、預示將有歷史上之決斷、使羅斯福實現其遝送物品至英國之諾言、但是吾使用護航則尙無立即之表示、依據各項表示、英國之近狀、已促使美國近臨極重要之一着、下列各項發展、巳增加美國不久即將有所舉動之印象、（一）羅斯福總統會召集其戰時內閣、達九十分鐘、據料係由閣員討論英國在巴爾幹之失敗、並增加援英之方法、（二）國會方面聆悉、美國運英之援助、有百分之四十、在大西洋北部爲德國所沉、（三）阿爾巴馬民主黨衆議員瑪特立克、在衆議院宣稱、現應考慮以美國海軍護航軍火赴英、（四）國會方而報告、政府現正研求計劃、以將美國之海穴中立巡邏、擴仲之大西洋中部、離美海軍前哨三百英里地域、紐的市長拉加地近宣稱加拿大及美國將防衛大西洋至距北美海岸一千英里之處云（廿五日合衆電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　據此間政界軍界人士意見、英軍雖又在希臘戰敗、並在北菲挫折、但仍有最後獲勝之望、祗須美國援央範圍甚於今茲、則英國卽始完全放棄全部歐洲大陸及北菲洲、其主力依然存在、根本上局勢仍未改觀、不過此事、較爲持久、取勝較爲困難而已、美國當局鑒於此種形勢、正在設法擴大援助英國、目　所當解決者、厥爲美國應吾派遣軍艦保護輪船、運送軍需接濟英國一項問題、此在最短時期之內、獲得解決辦法、非不可能、據紐的泰唔士報駐華盛頓訪員所得消息、美國卽當決定採取一種「海面及空中巡邏」政策、即遇輪船運送軍需前往央國時、由軍艦或飛機在數哩之外從事巡邏、如發見可疑之飛機或潛艇、即發出警吿、俾依此項輪船及時改道避免危險、此種變相的護航辦法、足使美國不致直接捲入歐戰漩渦、發明者聞係紐的市長拉加第亞云、（廿五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>重慶　消息靈通之中國方面人士、對美國務卿赫爾及海長諾克斯昨晚之演詞、加以評論時、表示滿意、彼等語合衆社記者謂、此項言論、在此時、允受特歡迎、因日本之宣傳、已顯示日本希望與美國修好、並暗示英日已在東京進行談判封閉滇緬路、中國方面指出、應付侵略之唯一方法、並非等待、而係立即採取行動、阻止侵略計劃之有效方法、則係銷除或毀壤侵略者之援助、如若太遲、則並無效果云、（廿五日合衆社電）</p>

<p>辯論日期　尚未決定</p>
<p>倫敦　昨日午後下院中提出英帝國各部國會同時辯論戰事之動議、首相在下院宣布國會程序而迄未決定辯論日期時、保守黨議員溫特頓請首相注意澳洲國會辯論之日期、謂其意英帝國他部國會中若有消息發表、而英國侖中未予發表、殊屬不幸、邱吉爾答稱、若謂英國須與澳洲同日舉行辯論、實屬創舉、且在意義上侵犯自治領各有的獨立權利、然零亂辯論顯感小便、吾人正與澳洲·紐西蘭·加拿大與南非各自治領政府作密切之接觸、以佈置此等辯論、而盡可能範圍對獨立或個別行動不稍有妨礙、澳洲國會在五月份第一週以前未必集議云、（二十五日路透社電）</p>

<p>新加坡　防務增强之新加坡大砲壘、普通均認爲其後鬥（卽沿馬來半島之東海岸）有密不可透之熱帶森林掩蔽、爲天然屛障、外敵決難攻入、此說現已不可靠、英國駐馬來亞之軍隊、巳證明雖在最密茂之林區、其視域不能遠出十碼以外者、亦非不可通過、某印軍團長、新近會作一實騐、擇一森林最深密之地、用兵士數名、僅恃地圖指南針及大刀之力、於數小時內、占領八英里外之目的地、蓋森林之密、僅密在灌木之叢藪或小樹、大樹澤甚稀疏、故不難用大刀割出路徑一條、經此敎訓、馬來亞之防禦策略、不免有改革之必要、以前有主守主攻二說、各堅持其優點、但參照去年法蘭西戰役之經騐、馬來亞之英軍、必須搜尋及攻滅外敵於本境之外、不可使其行近新島、因馬來亞之地勢不能用於壕溝戰、或陣地戰也、故現時英軍之主要訓練、爲使其成爲一種襲擊軍、（二十五日台衆電）</p>

<p>歐戰叢談（四七）</p>
<h3>威爾基遊英始末</h3>
<p>他的兩眼雖　倦容，態度却依然振奮。當他預　好的演說稿正在複印的半小時中，傍聽席上頗爲騷動，他却很安靜地和他近旁的參議員談論戰事與這决的旅行。旁聽的羣家中，性情固執的議員妻子，態度傲慢的華盛頓孤立派，等待駁倒威爾基證辭的委員侖朋友，以及耐心注意的平民百姓，諸色人等都有。</p>
<p>三個攝影師不避危險地爬到離地四十呎高的屋樑上拍照。此時議論粉紛，人聲龐雜。及至複印好的演說稿分發到各委員的手中，聽衆都靜了下來。威爾基以肘抵桌，冷靜地宣讀他有條件擁護租借法的理由。他說，「美國人有兩條路可走。第一條路，美國應閉關自守，鞏固國防，使侵略者望而却步。他相信這種路綫將破壞美國的自由，結果反是引起戰禍—獨裁者必定不惜蓄童阻撓，暗中破壞，使我們不得不奮起作戰。另一條路，不但須認淸人與人間的相互關係，且須認淸觀念和原理間的相互關係。極權國的貿易方法惟有廣大的國際自由空間存在，始能避免，因之，援助英國，實際上並非爲着英國，而是與英國共同保衛這種自由的空間。」</p>
<p>當政府提出租借法案時，因爲內容空洞，美國人大起震動，威爾基的陳述，却提出各項明晰具體的建議，聽者更爲動容。當他提議美國應每月供給英國驅逐艦五艘至十艘，並應廢除繁文縟節，趕造巡邏轟炸機和商船的時候，聽者有如觸電一般。他爲求人民意見一致起見，會籲請國會中的多數黨應和少數黨合作，協同解決一切粉爭，這樣一來，對於以</p>
<p>威爾與英內務大臣莫理遜廣大權力授與總統，發生疑懼的人，胸中便可豁然開朗了。</p>
<p>這位失敗的總統候選人，宣讀證辭有半小時之久。議員們洗耳靜聽，共中一個熱心擁護的人，情不自禁，鼓掌稱善。有幾個先前反對的人也頻頻點首，表示贊成。委員會主席喬治詢議員有無質問。哈立遜沒有，康納萊沒有，一個七十四歲的老孤立派加利福尼亞州參議員的翰遜也搖着頭說，「我沒有問題。」</p>
<p>其决輪到樊登堡了。這位密歇根州參議員，本是孤立派健將，新近纔傾向援英政策，謹愼的問道，「這是全力援英政策嗎？這種政策，爲使英國能支持起見，會把我們牽入戰爭漩渦嗎？」</p>
<p>威爾基答道，「據我的判斷，美國祇有一個團體有宣戰之權，假使我是國會中的一員，我決不投票贊成宜戰，除非全國與情傾向宣戰一途，我爲遵守選民之意，也沒有別的方法了。」</p>
<p>威爾基坐在椅中，態度安詳，避免曲解，絕不遊移，於是贊成的聲調逐漸加强了，說他是美國一位偉人，是一個靠得住的領袖。</p>
<p>接着是參議員克拉克。他面色紅潤，辭鋒銳利，素來不肯讓人，這時用着尖銳的聲調發問，「威爾基先生，你在週遊英倫時，英國希望美國派艦護送軍備，你有些知道嗎？」</p>
<p>「我想不起有人表示過這樣的願望。」</p>
<p>「你不是說起過這事嗎？」</p>
<p>威爾基道，「不差，我是照着我的心裏說，我一向是這樣的。」</p>
<p>克拉克又問，英國獲得美國轟炸機，倘仍不免於失敗，則當如何。威爾基道，「假使我們以轟炸機接濟英國，能削弱德國的力量，比較我們保存着織炸機，我們地位可以更强。」</p>
<p>「你飛繞牛個地球，却來指導本委員會嗎？」</p>
<p>「我飛繞半個地球，不是爲指導委員會或仟何人。我們須要公道……」</p>
<p>克拉克連任議員有年，每决演說，常以「總統先生」開塲，這時他忘其所以，面向威爾基，在播音器中照常喊道，「總統先生……」</p>
<p>聽衆掌聲大作，克拉克面紅耳赤，立刻停止發言。議長喬洽擊桌禁止喧嘩，警吿聽衆不要鼓噪。隔了一會又和藹地說道，「假使你們要笑，你們笑就是了。」</p>
<p>克拉克繼又攻擊威爾基的競選演說道，威爾基先生不是說過，在外交方面，他不能曲從總統嗎？他不是說過，總統攻擊外國是無益而有危險性的嗎？</p>
<p>「當然，我曾說過這些話，」威爾基抗議說。他不願再翻舊案，競選時他確曾發表激烈的論調，他雖不願回答，但並不是懼怕，祇因爲重起爭端，於事無益。他又說，「我曾竭力奮鬥，謀把羅斯福打倒。可是他已當選連任總統了。他</p>
<p>威爾基在參議院外交委員會陳述援英理由現在是我的總統了。但無論何時，祇要我喜歡，仍可與他意見不同。」</p>
<p>盤問旣畢，聽衆包圍在威爾基的四周，警察衝開一條路，讓威爾基避到喬治議長的辦公室去。聽衆又紛紛議論，有的說這是功敢和犧牲的特殊表式，有的說他將成爲落選總統中最不失敗的一人。</p>
<p>威爾基巳證明此决英倫之遊和他立塲的正當，廿一天前，一個寒冷的早晨，一架飛機載着他從賴加第亞飛行塲出發，那時誰想到有這樣重大的結果呢！他自足履英土，即不辭勞瘁的巡視三島，回來之後，又在參議員外交委員會獲得勝利，威爾基的生命，遂重獲世人的注意了。</p>
<p>英國飛機製造「大王」皮孚勃洛克爵士對倫敦一位朋友說，「我上星期會和美國下屆總統聚餐。」是威爾基嗎？皮孚勃洛克爵士却叉露齒笑着說過，他也會同羅期福總統的特使霍普金聚餐過呀！</p>

<h3>糧食　洋米貼價　仍在暗漲　港米來滬已有價</h3>
<p>昨日洋米巳稍形活動、木客實消雖尙無暢胃、而鄉莊內地與滬西各戶已漸漸活躍、全日市內外成交四五千包、暗盤貼價因市上供應不多、執貨者乃又趁機扳俏、小紋每百包貼價又自一千元至一千一·二百元、西貢一號則有一千六百之喊價、市形突比前昨爲緊俏、國米亦無正市、</p>

<h3>粉市略見抑小</h3>
<p>現洋粉市况、略見鬆疲、蓋以連日客銷一度活動後、因米市陷於停頓、及坎粉新牌新到頗多、客戶趁此抑價、而執貨者尙圖扳守、故市面檳局、結果僅開金龍牌坎粉三十元零七八角、及新到白菜牌三十一元、成交的近萬包、惟澳粉鐘樓花烏兩牌、則以存到兩少、售價尙須三十一元四五角、華廠平賣粉仍爲二十五元、由福新廠供給五千八百七十二包、</p>

<h3>金融　外滙微露鬆象</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、各匯勿更、英美匯暗市微趨鬆賤、乃金價退至六千七百兀大關內、且投機家於晨開後即來塞、一度爲華行上海大陸收吸所抵銷、近午匯豐及美行忽有吐出、又露鬆勢、但本月美金五元一八七五爲銀行互做價、投機家未易結得、英金則硬至三辦士一八七五、下午銀行納胃轉滯、而投機家力塞更殷、下月美金須五元二一八七五、始可售出、終而結五元一八七五、英金三辦士一八七五、均見軋鬆、全日交易聞銀行互做爲盛、</p>
<p>銀行對做爲多</p>

<h3>出籠紛起　金市再挫</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚亦暗盤、徘徊步跌、價已退入八千七百元大關內、因聞中交四行將爲下週初復業、各方人心漸較安定、外滙又報鬆、匯豐等英美商行供售、塲內出籠之風更不息、金號匯票商鑫源等爭售、浮多不斷斬結、價由晨開六千七百二十元、形步下落、午後見六千六百六十八元低價、終見滬西幫補空提上、爲六千六百七十九元、軋小三十元、收後更疲、全日交易共的三萬兩、掉期（四月轉入五月）貼價　高、賣方益大貼出予買方鑫源九百兩、價四十五元、後續貼出四百兩、立泰七十兩、均五十元、由義元貼進、下午益大又貼出予或記七百兩、價五十元、現金全日未做開、賣方喊照期交價高一百六十元、買　僅還高一百五十元、比上日的軋小四十餘元、飾金亦掛小五元、計七百零五元云、</p>
<p>烚赤續降三十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）丸點十五分開市爲六千七百廿元、比上日收價高十一元、新豐永·仁承永·義豐來吐出、下挫甚速、退至六千六百九十五元、但外匯仍穩、未鬆、成記·益大·合盛·德孚、大豐來力、當見提上至六千七百十八元、鑫元·義元·新豐永來售出、在六千七百十元左右稍有盤旋、直至午刻匯豐售出美金五元　八七五、散戶亦售、頓見撳小至六千七百元內、爲六千六百八十五元、成記買進、當又提上、正午收市六千七百零四元、下午二點開市爲六千七百零二元、比午收價低　元、决見六千七百零五兀、鑫源·益利·公大·大豐·新豐永·相繼來售出、外滙趨鬆、價乃盤小三十餘允、退至六千六百六十八元、因天元·德大買進、新豐永復購、滬四幫補空、立見回升至六千六百八十元、四點收市六千六百七十九元、比前日晚收價續降卅元、照五月美金五几一八七五結價、爲六千七百十三元、的撳三十叫元、收市後又降至六千六百七十元、最後七十二三元、全　有五十一元上落、現金號之本牌金、售價比烚赤期交價高一百七十元、收進比售出低八十元、現標金無價無市、</p>

<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、大同行與新同行於十一點卅分掛小五元、計七百零五允、（收進减四十元）云、</p>
<h3>金鎊忽有需要　獨漲一元</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價、雖盤旋下趨、但英美金鎊因忽有需要市價尙各漲一元、英金票呆定如故、市價站半、美金票起落仍甚倏忽、卒吿下落一角三分、晚市退爲十八元八角半、香港票供求均勻、市價站平、日金票仍鮮變動、晚市仍站二元一角原盤、朝鮮票略有需要晚市升至一元八角五分、</p>
<h3>紗花　浙東戰事擴大　紗布內運又遭阻梗　雙馬浮多紛紛吐出</h3>
<p>紗市向下、趨勢由盤旋而疲、此因現紗銷路淸澹、加浙東戰事擴大、紗布內運、叉遭阻梗、因之人心不振、空頭粉紛活動、一部份浮多鑒於環境不良、逐步吐出、同時某某等放空額量殊鉅、按然勿動、所以檯面上之籌碼、殊感充斥、而四行復業在即、外匯寗靜、揑多者略現不安矣、於是看跌之議復盛、大衆心意、謂大跌面不致發現、恐見一千四百五十元、當可購進、二十支雙馬高價五千四百九十二元、低價爲一千四百八十四元、午後初做一千四百八十六元、繼以標金價挫跌至一千四百七十九元、最　價爲一千四百八十一二元、今日有棉紗一百六十五件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、氣勢平常、因材料利多甚鮮、人心乏勁首盤價爲一千四百八十八化、少頃微升至一千四百九十二元、旋後標金市面開出亦和平、於是塲上交易極淸、市盤一經徘徊在九十元至八十八元之間、繼聞實銷寂寞、浮多了結、市悄允鬆、迨至十一時牛後、跌至一千四百八十四元、但搶帽子者抵空、收盤又　回至一千四百八十七元、查牛日間成交統計六千一百三十五包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列於後、</p>
<p>香港　一三五同行六、〇〇〇</p>
<p>統計六、一三五</p>
<h3>減工聲中　棉市季度暗澹</h3>
<p>現棉情况、極形暗澹、各方交易異常蕭條、此因紗市孱弱、廠方停辦、同時外棉下落甚勁、允使人心衰敗矣、昨現棉成交、祇同裕進火機花二百包、棧交價一百九十六元、</p>
<p>另訊滬埠洋行外棉交易、較前似覺靜寂、蓋日來國際情勢頗呈危急、人心不無惶恐、同時又因現紗市塲趨跌、紗廠减工將成事實、故各方購意巳感淡薄、而市况亦稍有軟弱也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、仍屬搖曳不定、而有參差、又因多頭了結、及南方幫賣出而跌、昨日收盤價格、較之上日低洛三五磅音不等、</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因空頭抵補而漲、旋因棉商賣出抑平、但後因田畝報吿反動而漲、同時歐洲出口商繼續買進、而市况挺進、結果收盤價格、各漲二至六羅比不等、又預測今日開盤市况、看小半羅比、</p>
<h3>疋頭　浙閩幫退關貨　削價吐售</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市趨勢微軟、客銷甚呆、浙閩幫未裝及退關貨、按市便宜續有吐售、惟同業及囤戶墊存貨額、堅持不鬆、廠方期貨、索價又見提高、與市上手貸背道而馳、咋白貨細布斜紋跌二角半、粗布跌二角牛至五角、漂染布售盤漲跌互見、本街成交各布二百餘件、港粤南洋幫辦怡和綸員漂布藍布花布絨呢等二百餘件、今日有疋頭一百八十件運香港、</p>
<p>東布　市氣軟弱、良以實銷寥落、散戶吐售故也、白貨龍頭細布後市收盤現棧單五十一元一角半、叫君子嗶嘰一元五角四分一釐半、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價急轉　跌元餘至三五元</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢仍弱、急轉直下一致續跌、而國際局勢亦呈懈象、多方無所憑藉、頗有傾吐、價乃愈軟、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白九十九元半至化十九元、跌三元、期貨四月底打單初緊後鬆、以一百〇一元開盤、旋微升爲〇一元半、一元二角、復回至元、旋即跌人百元關內爲　百元〇〇八角、七角、五角、而至九十九元、九十九元五角、六角、五角、一角、二角、五月十日打單初爲一百〇二元、二元八角、三元、三元三角、三元、二元半、二元四角、二角、二元、一元半、一元又小至〇〇五角、七角、中途稍好爲〇一元、一元二角、一元、收盤仍軟爲〇〇五角八角、七角、均跌一元八角、太古車白因續有到貨、跌勢亦勁、B嘜東棧貨爲一百〇五元、跌去五元、HHX嘜　棧九十八元半、跌二元七角、荷赤較平、爲七十九元半、小五角、</p>
<h3>五金　新鉛絲標準堅挺</h3>
<p>新鉛絲市面、因客幫生意不繼、蠆批交易缺乏、市况未能熱鬧、惟門莊零星尙不寂、市上流通貨並不衆多、因而執貨者扳持甚堅、行盤如十六號至二十號每市擔售三百二十元、二十一號至二十五號之細花色每市担猶須三百五十元、標準堪稱堅挺、然成交相當岑寂耳、</p>
<h3>南北貨　水東枝續有開出</h3>
<p>水東枝及海口枝、邇來去化雖甚靜寂、但價格尙屬相宜、前途不無希望、故行方進胃不衰、至於號方手貨、如欲再守、必須、增加冷氣費、或焙工等、故亦願意脫手、昨聞開出一二千箱、價格與前彷彿、無甚上落、</p>
<h3>罌粟（續）</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>從歷史上看，古代的埃及人，希臘人，印度人，在公元前一千多年以來就知道栽種它，利用它。譬如荷馬在依理亞特史詩上吿訴我們說：那在公元前十二世紀惹起特類戰爭的天香國色的海倫，親手給她丈夫的同伴——那些憂鬱的戰士們，斟上「忘憂的酒」。這忘憂的酒中，就包含着雅片的成分的。至於海倫的知此秘訣，是埃及的一個女巫教給她的。希臘神話中引導人周遊黑甜鄉的「睡神」，頭上戴的却是罌粟組成的花冠，手裏拿着一爵雅片：這雅片叉名叫「提比期（Thebes）的榨汁」。提比斯是表示雅片的原產地，那不是希臘的名城，而也是埃及的。至於希臘人所最恭敬艷稱的建立過十二大奇功的英雄愛爾居樂（Herenl），他的第十一决奇功，是往非洲一個花園裏，偷那日夜被一條毒龍看守着的金蘋菓。愛爾居樂是把雅片混合在蜂蜜裏，叫那兇惡的毒龍吃下去睡着了，然後纔偷到手裏的。而且近來歐洲的考古學家，在瑞士巳竟湮沒的古湖中，發現在古時湖居時代的居民房屋裏，巳竟有罌粟的存在了。難說這引證的東亞大半是神話，然而就是拿那寫作紳話的著奢的時代說，他們明瞭這雅片的功用，業遠在紀元前八九世紀的時候哩。</p>
<p>又根據辭源續編引證佛經昆奈耶雜律說：「緣在王城時，常罌疾病，曾吸藥烟，得蒙瘳損，諸　芻以緣百。佛言：「有病者聽吸烟治病。」　芻不解安藥治病，佛言：「可以兩碗相合，底上穿孔，於中着火，置藥吸之。不應用竹，可將鐵作，長十二指，勿合尖利，亦勿粗惡，置碗孔吸烟。用了，不應輙棄，可用小袋盛舉，掛象牙　上　　竹　：後於用時，不應水洗，應置火中燒以取凈。」……」這眞是把烟斗，烟槍的形狀，吸烟和保藏烟槍的法子，陳述的淸淸楚楚無以復加了！吸雅片之肇始於此，蓋無可疑。不過這篇佛經的著者是誰？何時成書，是否眞可以追溯　釋迦牟尼的時代呢？我想就是小在公元前六世紀佛敎創始的當時，大的也不致過於往復了。（編者按佛敎對於吸烟，頗多詆惡，且比之所謂，叉焉知不爲烟早之烟。）</p>
<p>到了公元七世紀初，模罕默德和他的勇悍的信徒們，從阿刺伯沙漠中崛起面奠定了天方國——　食帝國的基礎：它的文化是繼承古埃及和希臘的餘緒的，所以回教的醫師們對於罌粟的功用允爲瞭然，而這種藥品的　用，當然也是範圍一天一天的廣闊了。（未完）</p>

<h3>法商水電及公用車　明日起均加價　法公董局已經核准實行　車資每站增二分之六分</h3>

<h3>醫學的故事（續）</h3>
<p>— 靑萍</p>
<p>患病吃藥不如早爲預防保持健康</p>
<p>此外更有幾幅值得紀念的有關我國新醫史的圖像。（一）柯列琪T·R·Colledge他是美國人，生於一匕九七年，卒於一八七九年。是基督敎醫藥傳道會發起人，並爲吾國最早醫院之創辦者。（二）黃寬，生於一八二八年，卒於一八七八年。畢業於英國愛丁堡大學，是中國留學西洋得醫學博士學位的第一人。（三）金韻梅女士，生於一八六四年，卒於一九三四年，她是美國紐的女子大學醫學博士，是中國女子留學外國畢業的第一人。</p>
<p>在裏面一室裹，搜藏着中國醫學上古代文物，有醫祖的偶像，醫治用的器具，藥瓶等，和幾書櫉的中國醫學書，都非常名貴。還有醫生畫的山水畫等等。</p>
<p>樓下有一個圖書館，搜羅着全世界的醫學藥物等雜誌，共有二百多種。這圖書館是紀念巳故牛惠生醫生的，故定名爲「牛惠生紀念圖書館。」天井裏建立着一塊紀念牛醫生的碑碣，因爲牛醫生對於中國醫學會是有特殊功蹟的人。另外一室爲藏書室，陳列着中國醫學會歷年來所出版的書籍雜誌。</p>
<p>中國醫學會現在共出版五種刊物：（一）中華醫學雜誌（中文月刊），（二）中華醫學雜誌（英文月刊），這兩種是純學術性的刋物。（三）中國醫界指南，是中央合璧的年刊，將全國醫師姓名，住址，及衛生機關，醫院，醫校，醫學團體等等，詳細編入。（四）中華健康雜誌，是中文兩月刊，這是大衆閱讀的醫學衛生通俗讀物。（五）上海醫事週刊，中英合璧，是本埠醫界名家互通醫訊，以探討學術，推進醫務。其中中華健康雜誌是最適合一般民衆的閱讀，不談高深的學理，只講日常生活的衛生常識，誠如該雜誌主編余新恩博士說：「我們當努力以民衆之興趣需要爲中心，儘量避免太過於專門的文字，或太近於課本化，務使民衆對本誌發生濃厚的興趣而能獲到益處。」</p>
<p>中國醫學會和中華健康協會實際上是兩位一體，前者是學術性的，後者是爲社會實際需要直接爲社會民衆謀健康幸福而服務的，記者已於中華健康協會訪問記一文中闡述甚詳。他們除了九個診療所以及衛生實騐區等工作外，並舉辦一個護士訓練班，訓練爲社會服務的護士；舉行播音演講，灌輸民衆醫療及衛生知識，務使他們的工作，能引起社會大衆的注意，因而獲得健康幸福。公共衛生護士訓練由何祝萱小姐主持的，現有七位學員，六位是紅十字會醫院派去的，一位是仁演醫院派去的；她們都是將要畢業的護士，她們巳很懂得了怎樣看護病人。再到這里來訓練一月，使她們更知道怎樣爲公共衛生方面服務。每月一班，學員都是公共醫院裏派來的。</p>
<p>健康協會現任理事是：刁信德（會長），富文壽（副會長），周誠滸（司庫），施思明（秘書），朱恒璧·海深德·王淑貞·沈驥英·陸梅儈。侯祥川。沈嗣良·甘林·顏遂良。贊助人馮炳南·朱爾登·金寶善。姚鈞石·巴呂德·海利。以上諸人，或爲政府機關關於衛生事業方面的主管官員，或爲著名醫學機關公共衛生團體的會長，或是社會名流學者等。該會實際主持會務的職員是：總幹事歐陽忠，公共衛生區主任黃懷信，宣傳祖主任余新恩，會員組主任何祝萱。</p>
<p>怎樣去找一個「可靠的醫生」，同時對於赤貧的同胞能不能酌量免費診治？這點，中國醫學會和中華健康協會雖在人財兩方面極度困難的時期，他們是忠實英勇地把這份艱鉅的責仟担負起來了。他們的目的：「是以最高的學術，最合乎一般人民經濟的辦法來服務。一方面是推廣健康運動，防病於未來；一方面爲了疾病治療，也附設九個診療所，由專門醫師担任檢查診治各科，赤貧的還可以免費。疑難的疾病，還可介紹給專家醫生診治。自然，等病了再要吃藥，遠不如早爲防病及保持健康；後者的裨益，不但是不費金錢，而且對於個人的身體壽命，有莫大影響。好比壞過一次的機器，總不比沒有壞過的機器來得堅贊」！（完）</p>

<p>英文大美晚報云、工部局設置臨時董事會、已於八日前得公共租界納稅外人之贊助、但關係各國是吾加以核准、工部局迄今米從各該國駐滬領事接獲任何答覆、故臨時董事曾、仍不得成立、本市官方人士、今（二十五日）晨答覆記者時、未能解釋關係各國領事遲遲未覆之原因、一般人則信工部局之更變、所以迄今未巡核准者、乃重慶中政府聲明反對所致、關係各國巳吾分別與中政府談判設置臨時董事曾事、現尙未知、</p>

<h3>泰國貨輪　首次運米來滬　米號照限出售但加限制</h3>
<p>昨日米市、因囤戶依舊扳價居奇、而各米號咸不願購買貼費米糧、故未到塲營業、全體掮客、亦不入塲、致市况仍陷於僵持狀態中、昨日各米號門售、照常維持、價格亦均能依照官定限價、惟出售數量、則視各該米號之存底而加以限制、</p>
<p>廉價港米　盼速分配</p>
<p>當局若能以業已獲得五千噸優先權之米糧、及早直接分配各米號、照限價以供門市、則各米號可暫時不必至米市塲購買囤戶操縱之米糧、而正當米商直接參加集團採購港米、允應從速進行、以避免不法份子抬價之影響、又聞昨米市塲雖未有正式之交易、但傳有投機份子、在塲外仍有私行貼費行爲者、是則切盼當局亟宜嚴加注意也、</p>
<p>港四專員　昨日離滬</p>
<p>自港政府允按月供給仰光特別小絞二十萬包或二十五萬包後、米商認購者頗爲踴躍、茲豆米雜糧兩業公會除將已認定數額即日彙報工部局備查外、正式組織集團購米委員會、又悉港府派來哈萊等四員、業於咋日離滬返港報舌、</p>
<p>泰國貨輪　運米來滬</p>
<p>大陸報云、泰國航運公司之貨船Sisuntnon　Nawa號、（一·九九七噸）載米三千餘噸、從盤谷取道食港駛來、定本月二十七日抵滬、卸下米糧後、五月二日起椗駛返、父該公司貨船Suriyothai　Nawa號、定五月初從盤谷抵此、查此兩船均係初决駛滬、乃試航性質、若成績圓滿、則泰國航運公司之共他貨船四艘、亦將航行上海、載運貨物、</p>
<p>米價屢漲　推究責任</p>
<p>昨據熱悉米市者語稱、本市存米已屆最豐盈之期、按諸過去情形而觀米價應即連續猛跌、惟且前米市反背道而馳、暗盤叢生、越限時聞、究諸癥結所在、不外下列三點、（一）名米行咸將辦來國洋米糧、企圖居奇、不肯按限出籠、同時豆米公會亦未採有效步驟、制裁不端同業、（二）米行職員亦竟購囤米糧、爲數雖少、惟米價　被若輩所抬高、（三）當局對米糧限價、無法嚴格執行、屢决中途寬放、或取消、乃至威信全失、收效徒然、</p>

<h3>一個女接綫生</h3>
<p>— 蕭雲</p>
<p>在被慘炸下的央國，不斷地有英雄的小故事透露出來。</p>
<p>是一件非常簡單的事情。一個醫院裏的女接錢生，在醫院被炸了以後，身體被壓在斷垣殘壁之下，可是依然神色不變，鎭靜地繼續執行她的任務。最令人感動的，是她在那危險的被炸地區，在那不自然不舒適的姿勢下，一連還接了一百二十二個電話，直到有人來把她救出來爲止。</p>
<p>接綫生，也許是低微的職位，接綫，也許是簡單的任務，可是祇　她能堅守她的崗位，她巳經盡了她的最大的貢獻了。她跟前綫的將士，一樣是值得敬佩的。</p>
<p>社會</p>
<h3>紅燭淚</h3>
<p>— 秋聲</p>
<p>我是一個未出嫁先作寡的少女；因爲訂婚後，未婚夫就死了。</p>
<p>我大嫂是一個做了將近一年新嫁娘後的「未亡人」；因爲我大哥過了十一個月的新婚生活，就永別了大嫂。</p>
<p>我伯母也是一個寡婦，她現在巳是五十多歲的老太太了。可是母親吿訴我們：伯父逝世時，她比我們還年靑。</p>
<p>我們的家裏，幽禁着這樣三個　尬的人物。</p>
<p>父親母親常在我們的面前，贊揚伯母的「貞節」；允其在我大嫂的面前。我不知道他們是何用意。</p>
<p>照理，伯母受了別人的贊揚，應當歡喜：可是她不然，—常常倚着門，遼望天邊，望着白雲嘆息；對於伯父的事，始終不願談起；她看見大嫂流淚，也會流淚。聽說：伯父母不過是名義上的夫妻，她至今記不淸楚，她的丈夫，究竟是一個怎樣的人物。</p>
<p>在伯母出嫁以，伯父已患着肺病，而且臥倒在牀上已有牛年多了；不知請過了多少名醫診治。但是應了「眞病無藥醫的俗語，藥石對於伯父的病，到底失了功效。</p>
<p>父母愛子女是無微不至的；但是人類又是自私的動物。伯父雖是已病入膏肓而無可救藥了；可是祖父母還是緊拉着垂死的兒子不肯撒手，他們還在竭力想法，只要兄子或有起死回生的一綫希望，不惜任何犧牲，都得一試。雖然這樣的嘗試，非常危險；會犧牲人家的子女。</p>
<p>我鄉迷信的氤氳，是非常濃厚的，人病了，先求神鬼，後請醫生，甚至有只求神鬼，而不請醫生，病人雖死，亦不悟的。「冲喜」就是迷信的產物，我伯母的畢生幸福，就是被「冲喜」衝掉的。</p>
<p>它，—「冲喜」簡直是吃人的魔鬼，它吃掉了我伯母的靑春。在過去，巳咀咀嚼不知多少似我伯母般的人物，現在還張開血盆大口，向着軟弱婦女進攻，沒有人敢擊破它，因爲它有傳統的潛勢力。</p>
<p>伯父巳病得這樣沉重，據許多人說：這是「晦氣，」「晦氣」可以用「喜氣」來衝除的。試想：一個年靑的病人，病勢這麼重，病得又這麼久，苦之不暇，何喜氣之有呢！可是人雖垂危，「洞房花燭，」到底是人生莫大的喜慶，法律上又沒有禁止病人結婚的規定，即使有，在偏僻之鄉，也不會發生多大效力的。在我鄉，鬼都能結婚，何况是沒有死的病人！於是我祖父母，忙着爲我久病的伯父籌備婚事了。想假借結婚的「喜氣」，驅除伯父的「晦氣。」</p>
<p>大概是「喜氣」戰不過病魔，因此反而得罪了「晦氣」吧！不然，結婚的那夜，伯父的病，怎會突然的轉劇呢？伯父的病體，勢難行禮節隆重的婚禮，可是人不愧爲「萬物之靈，」在如此情勢之下，祖父又想出了：「妹妹權且代巷哥哥」的主張。於是我小姑母，代替了她的大哥和大嫂在大廳上行婚禮了。所謂「洞房花燭夜」，不過是新嫁娘陪伴了垂死的新郎，限看着替人流淚的紅燭，輕輕嘆息。</p>
<p>這就是叫做「冲喜」，可是「冲」來的，並不是「喜！」不到半個月，伯父竟與新婚的伯母長別了。我年靑的伯母，就這樣成了世人的所謂寡婦。她守寡到現在，巳有三十多年了！</p>
<p>兒童節那天晚上，也就是淸明的前一天，二哥和二嫂，陪着兩個孩子出去了，爸爸辦公還沒有回來，媽媽又上街去採辦明日祭祀祖先用的貨物了，家裏靜悄悄地，我又瞧見大嫂躺在牀上流淚。不知怎的，大嫂近日更容易傷感了，不論在熱鬧的塲合中，或是在幽靜的家庭裹，她常會偷偷地流淚。上次，吃了三弟的訂婚酒後，她無端的躲在房裏，哭泣了整整的一夜。有一决，我和大嫂，因事回到鄉下去，在途中遇釗一個不相識的年靑婦女，大概也是寡婦吧，在田野間的一個棺材旁哭丈夫。她看了也陪着流淚了。也許她是爲了我大哥而傷心；吾則，一定是在怨恨那吃人的「禮敎！」</p>
<p>大哥哥巳死了七年了！可是她還很年靑，今年只有二十六歲。她好似一個無期徒刑的囚犯，被囚在我們這個「世代書香」的家庭裏，她永失了歡笑，在讓苦痛毀滅自己。</p>
<p>前天，爸爸的朋友結婚，這位老新郎，轉托我父親，請我去彈琴。他今年已有四十多歲了，這决結婚，巳是第二决續弦了。「弦」斷了，可以「續」，那麼「琵琶」壞了呢？</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（七）　臉上劃一個十字</p>
<p>秋海棠已隨着那奶媽子走進裏面去看他的女兒了，丟下玉崑一個人留在外房。</p>
<p>在兩扇法國式長窗中間的一狹條奶黃色的墻壁上，新近叉添掛了一架六七寸闊的小鏡框，裏面嵌着一張怪活潑可愛的女孩子的照相，一邊還用藍墨水寫着「梅影二周歲攝」六個很纖細的小字，是女人的筆跡。</p>
<p>玉崑隨手把那一件山東綢大衫望左邊的一張籐椅上一丟，便又着雙手，站在那一架鏡框前面端相起來。</p>
<p>「看梅寶這孩子的相貌，倒又是個地上少見的美人胎子。細看起來，簡直一半像娘，一半像爺；假使有一分像我，這一張小險便完全斷送了……！」他心裏暗暗這樣匪夷所思的想，臉上不覺便浮起了一重怪頑皮的笑容來。二十七歲的人，還像個孩子一樣。</p>
<p>突然，靠洋台的那間臥房的門推開了，一個人從裏面走了出來。</p>
<p>「你怎麼今兒叉在這裏？」</p>
<p>那是湘綺家的啞丫頭，常常也到這裏來幫他們做一些事，順便伴伴奶媽子。</p>
<p>她正把一條才換下的床毯捧着想下樓去洗，見了玉崑，便憨憨的向他一笑，玉崑這才想起她是個天生聽不見，說不出的苦瓜。</p>
<p>「啊　不對！！這孩子上這兒來得太勤，叉且不知道怎樣避人，小心這件事壞在她的手裏！一個怪可怕的念頭，突然擁上玉崑的腦上來。「停一會必須跟老三說一聲，叫她這幾天千萬不要走動，寗可另外區雇一個老媽子來幫忙」。（九一）</p>
<h3>跛足無憂</h3>
<p>— 芝蕙</p>
<p>在最近的醫學園地中，X光錢又得到了一種新的應用；這個喜訊，特別是爲跛足者帶來的。</p>
<p>北美洲放射學會近在美國開會，有幾件最新的發現便成了會議的議題，關於應用X射綫治療跛足的方法，即是其中的一件。</p>
<p>跛足的原因，有因骨瘤，有因小兒痳痺症，（大名鼎鼎的羅斯福總統就是險些在小兒痳痺症裏送掉了性命），也有的是先天殘缺，致使一條腿的生長陷於停頓，而另一條腿却照舊發展，結果，便形成一高一低的跛足。</p>
<p>外科醫生處理跛足，倘病者兩腿長短相差在五寸以內，本來可用接骨的方法，使長的一面改短些，短的一而接長些，這樣也可以使兩腿着地時高低相等，在外觀並且能毫無破綻。</p>
<p>美國達拉斯城有一位史彭格勒醫生（Dr　Davis　Spangler），新近所發明的方法，却巳將前述舊的外科手術完全推翻。舊的外科手術顯然是治標的，而他的則是治本的；舊的方法祇能够截長補短，他的方法是從最初就根本阻止那條健康的腿生長得過長。這一位台塞斯州的專家，他過去會以四個跛足的兒童爲他學理上的試騐，他將他們各人正常的一條腿曝露於X光綫中很久很久，（據說這效力就等於人類息癌腫時的不能使器官發育一樣），使牠的發展不能長過另一條殘廢的腿；結東他的實騐是成功了，他的學理終於獲到了事實的證明。</p>

<h3>美國影業的方針</h3>
<p>— 心鵑</p>
<p>應付非常時期的策略</p>
<p>在世界局勢極度動盪，烽火遍地，風聲鶴唳的今日，無論是工業或商業，都遭受了絕大的打擊，差不多停歇在凝滯的狀態中。電影事業雖然在文化上和娛樂上，有着堅定崇高的地位，但是目下，至少也受了嚴重的威脅，予進展以致命的斵　，叫十年代是美國影業危機，正相同於二十年代的美國農業危機，和三十年代的美國工業危機。</p>
<p>美國電影事業的發達，執握着世界電影事業的牛耳，不　是　本，演員，技巧等等方面，差不多沒有一個國家能和它相頡頏的，因此隨着時局的　遷，所感受的影響，當亦以美國爲至深且　，世界電影市塲的喪失殆盡，歐洲和亞　兩個最大傾銷美國出品的地方，也都淪陷在戰爭中，情勢的惡化，使美國有荊棘叢生之慨。</p>
<p>在這種情形下，美國影業的處境，向是相當艱難，爲了職工的「麵包問電」，倘若一旦停工，那種紛亂惶急的情形，是可想而知的，因此爲了安穩波過目　的難關，各個和影業有關係的人，都在煞費心　，籌劃應付的方針和策略。</p>
<p>在影業巨頭的會商中，他們一致認爲祗有　高製片的質，藉以博取本國多量的觀衆，把白分之十五從來不看電影的人，和百分之三十到四十每月祇看决電影的人，吸引到電影院裏去，以彌補在喪失的市塲中的收入，這是一種「失之東隅，收之桑榆」的良策。</p>
<p>爲了重提高製片的質，因此在劇本方而，再也不允許「陳舊俗套」和「公式化」。在這種「鄭重攝製」的製片方針下，文藝片，傳記片，囚此應運產生了。過去有名而優秀的文藝片如：「亂世佳人」，「魂歸離恨天」，「香箋淚」，「蝴蝶夢」，「再生緣」，「怒火之花」，「魂斷藍橋」等。傳記片如：「自刦英雄」，「國外通訊員」，「水深火熱」，「民族精神」，「少年林肯」，「慾海慈航」，「幼年安迪生」，「偉人安迪生」，「路透傳」等，皆有很大的成功。即以去年爲證，文藝片是第一位，喜劇片决之，冒險片與傳記片第三，音樂片第四。</p>
<p>雖然在這時間中，還有許多較低級的歌舞片和滑稽片產生，但我們可以說電影雖是藝術，娛樂的成份也必要包合一點的，在這苦悶的時代中，娛樂消遺也不是　對要不得的事情，較輕　的影片，也許可以使人們舒暢　下胸襟，不過主要的，當然還是　義深刻，能適台　時代需要的影片。</p>
<p>至於有連續性的影片如：「哈代家庭片」，「四千金」，「聖俠」，「涮犬」，「大俠」，「吉爾台亞醫生」等，在成本上、雖然還屬於「B級片」，但製作上，却要把質提高了；並囚隨着「B級片」水準的提高，以後恐將「雙片制」取消也水可知，僅不過是時間問題和實施的遲早而已。淸暉</p>
<h3>狄安娜實萍的結婚計劃</h3>
<p>— 淸暉</p>
<p>狄安娜實萍的結婚問題，曾經轟動年餘，而今終於決定了，在本年六月舉行，現在佳期巳近，而竇萍又是一個寨愼的人，所以她對於新房設備如何？以及事業前途怎樣？都有一個全盤的計劃。</p>
<p>據竇萍說：她自決定婚期以後，就在皮佛萊山上買了一所大院落，內有游泳池，網球塲，及一畝多的空地，她以爲這就是她倆所理想的樂園。距離那裏不遠，有　所基督敎堂，他們就想在這敎堂裏舉行婚禮。</p>
<p>那座院子有一所低矮的白色樓房，式樣是加州南部的屋宇，與法蘭西式的大相逕庭，從巨大的牆門而入，是一個淺小的天井，一眼看見的是一座寬大的客廳，走進裏面會給你一種舒服的感覺，一切裝飾皆令人怡快，廳室又火父亮，在轉角陪處綴以明鏡，因此更顯得這廳堂巨大而明亮，對面是一扇玻璃門，園中風景，盡收眼底。椅子寬而深，桌子却玲瓏纖巧，室中所有一切陳設，無不美觀悅目。</p>
<p>上樓，第一個房間，是未來馮保羅的書窒，這確是精美之至，室小而舒齊，其寬大足使爐火之溫達於四隅。室中陳列着許多古玩。循左而行，是一個十分精美的育嬰窒，因爲竇萍的計劃是將孩子也包括在內的。她以爲婚姻非有孩子不算完滿，同時馮保羅也是很寵愛孩子的。</p>
<p>此外，寶萍當有一個廚司，因爲她不喜歡烹飪；馮保羅喜歡狗，所以在她們的新居裏該有一所精緻的狗房。他們又該僱用兩個汽車夫，她與馮保羅各有一輛大汽車，竇萍到最近才學會駕駛術。她又想建築一個完善的牧塲，一切設計皆極摩登，可是要令人在那裏發生一種野蠻的感覺，她物色這地方已經好久了，到現在還沒有覔到適當的地址。</p>
<p>至於她的事業前途怎樣？竇萍爽快的　答說：「現在金錢不是我最需要的，所以不必多管它，我要過人的生活，自由愉快的生活，從現在到結婚，我們已沒有空閒的假期，　我們好好相聚一下。以前每　分鐘的忙碌，可以使我快樂，但是現在任何事都不能使我開心，唯有和馮在一起是最快活了。然而工作方面，我仍負着我應有的責任，以前我是生活在大霧之中，如今感謝上帝，喚醒了我，引導我走上光明人道。」</p>
<p>眞的，狄安娜寶萍，現在是脚踏實地的去幹了。公司不能束縛她，結婚將增加她的幸福，她將有平衡充實自山愉快的生活，不再終日忙碌於攝影塲，卽是失去了優秀的名位，但她得到了康健的身　，幸福的家庭，可愛的丈夫，你看，狄安娜竇萍的前面仍懸着那彩色的虹光呢？</p>

<p>Adjusting Economic Institutions to Give Japan the Final Blow</p>
<p>Hong Kong: According to a public statement from the Guangdong Provincial Party Headquarters of the Chinese Kuomintang in Shaoguan, the Chinese authorities, due to the favorable military situation, are now mobilizing economic forces to fight the final battle with the Japanese army. The ratio of the economic war to the military war is currently seven to three. General Li Hanshun, Chairman of Guangdong Province, has returned to Shaoguan from Chongqing with a detailed economic plan. Since the Japanese have suffered setbacks in the military field, they have intensified the blockade of Guangdong's coast. The main purpose of the above plan is to counter Japan's economic blockade. According to the plan, China must mobilize national human and material resources, readjust and reallocate them, reduce consumption, and implement economic controls. In this way, final victory can be ensured. Old economic concepts must be replaced by wartime needs, so that the economic structure can be adapted to national defense programs. In order to implement the new economic institutions as soon as possible, a centralized system will be adopted. All tax authorities, cooperatives, transportation agencies, customs agencies, and salt and grain production and sales agencies will be included in the new economic structure. Technology is also essential for war, so it is also being mobilized. Young people will receive technical training, and all national manpower will be organized and trained. Workers, farmers, and women should be treated in this way so that the movement to increase production can be realized. The new economic structure is under the scientific and military institutions. After this decision plan is implemented, important industries and enterprises will be controlled by the government or nationalized. Government control will be strengthened, and daily necessities will also be supplied by the government. The economic activities of the people, from production to consumption, should be controlled to meet military needs. As for the people themselves, they must be thrifty.

<p>Chongqing: Dr. Monroe, a famous American educator, gave a radio address to his country here last night, saying that he has two views on the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact: one is that the pact is not a symbol of strength and courage, but a symbol of cowardice and fear. Both signatory countries have cowardly and fearful mentalities. At the same time, the Soviet Union is afraid of Germany, and Japan is afraid of Britain and the United States. The other is that both sides may agree that once the democratic camp collapses, they will jointly attack India and the Dutch East Indies. (Havas Dispatch of the 25th)</p>

<h3>Achievements of the Tuberculosis Prevention Movement</h3>
<p>In the first Tuberculosis Prevention Movement, 20 hospitals participated in free X-ray examinations, all of which were private hospitals; 17 pharmacies also provided medicines at low prices; and 6 laboratories, including Zhu Yanggao and Cheng Muyi, provided free sputum testing. The spirit of private new medical and pharmaceutical enterprises emerging to serve the public deserves deep sympathy. The profession of a doctor is to treat diseases, and the highest task of a doctor is to guide the public to prevent diseases before they occur, so that they do not get sick. If the public can get minor illnesses, or at least fewer illnesses, then the contribution of doctors to the nation, country, and society is greatest. This is the origin of the Chinese saying that a good prime minister is also a good doctor.</p>
<p>Serving the public is extremely difficult, first because there are many people, second because there are many matters, third because the quality of the people is uneven, and fourth because it is easy to be misunderstood by the public. Therefore, if one is not careful, one must not only work hard but also endure complaints. The examination of pathological conditions is extremely difficult, such as X-ray examinations, which still have some symptoms and sources that cannot be fully understood by fluoroscopy. Moreover, the consultation is hurried and the time is short; sputum tests may not show results. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to expand the tuberculosis prevention movement, so that it can be eradicated before it occurs, treated when it has occurred, and recovered in the aftermath. Only then can it benefit the people and achieve significant results.</p>
<p>However, this is not entirely the responsibility of private medical and pharmaceutical industries, but also relies on the cooperation of the public. Today, the service spirit of hospitals with public properties is not satisfactory. They are preoccupied with comparing the costs of medical treatment and surgery, and have no time to take care of the urgency of the disease. This is not as beneficial to the poor and sick as the charitable medical care and medicine provided by the Buddhist Jingye Society, Renji Shantang, and Jishenghui for decades. Private enterprises, no matter how lofty their ideals and how courageous they are in serving the public, are ultimately limited by their manpower and financial resources, and cannot fully achieve their wishes. Observing that the tuberculosis prevention movement has been continuously promoted by the health departments of the concessions, it has left a deep impression on the public's mind of preventing epidemics. Even women and children know the fearfulness of a fly spreading the plague, which is a clear proof that the epidemic prevention has achieved results, and it is also a good example of governing with virtue rather than punishment. The so-called "government" is for the people, and the so-called "virtue" is the education of good intentions; punishment is used to discipline those who do not follow the teachings. If punishment is used before education, it is called punishing without teaching, which is the fault of the officials and cannot be blamed on the people. Therefore, spitting everywhere is originally a bad habit and a medium for the transmission of diseases, which should be eradicated. However, the way to eradicate it is not through punishment. Some people think that punishment can serve as a warning, and that without punishment, how can people be encouraged? This is not true either. Punishment can indeed serve as a warning, but knowing to avoid punishment without knowing that it should not be done, then if the punishment is relaxed, the old ways will return. Today, the government, whether it is national or municipal, should not only allow the people to be guided but also allow them to know. It is now the time when the people can be both guided and allowed to know. Therefore, the success of the tuberculosis prevention movement depends on widespread and effective publicity, so that the public can understand the harm that tuberculosis causes to themselves and others, and guide them to seek treatment and provide them with convenient medical treatment and medicine. If this is done, over time, even if tuberculosis cannot be eradicated, it can be reduced by a large margin. If punishing spitting is considered a way to eradicate old habits, it is not only easy to violate the prohibition, but the majority of ignorant rural people will be affected, which is disturbing the people, not nurturing them, and not what is called governing with virtue. Virtue is transformed through education, and when it is transformed, it penetrates the people, becomes a social custom, and then people will willingly follow the teachings without the need for punishment!</p>
<p>However, the tuberculosis prevention movement is a movement to strengthen the nation. Therefore, the most effective defense is to resist with one's own physical strength. The air contains an unknown number of germs, and an unknown number of germs enter the body with each breath. The world does not cause everyone to get tuberculosis, nor does it cause everyone to get sick. This is because those with strong resistance can resist germs invisibly, while those with weak resistance are invaded by germs. It can be seen that developing inherent resistance is the easiest and most effective way to prevent tuberculosis. If one waits until one is sick before seeking treatment, it is too late. Therefore, how to cultivate everyone's resistance is also a major issue that public health should pay attention to and guide.</p>
<p>Furthermore, manpower is the master of all undertakings, and funding is the mother. Tuberculosis is extremely easy to transmit, and people cannot leave society, so they cannot say that they are not worried about transmission. However, no social figures have been seen to support the tuberculosis prevention movement. If people do not seek support, then support will come from people. With funding, the development of the undertaking will be easier. What is now hoped for from the public is that they should not think of tuberculosis prevention as a matter for a few medical and pharmaceutical circles, but as a matter that is closely related to the masses. They should mobilize the manpower and financial resources of the masses to eliminate the tuberculosis that harms the people. Secondly, those who suffer from tuberculosis should cherish themselves and not transmit it to others, and should voluntarily isolate themselves from others. Thirdly, those who do not have tuberculosis should cherish themselves and not damage their own resistance, so that germs can easily invade. If this can be done, the tuberculosis prevention movement will be twice as effective with half the effort.</p>
<h3>Guo Taiqi States in the United States that China Will Surely Win; The United States Is a Decisive Factor in the World War; Freedom of Belief Will Eventually Triumph Over Power</h3>
<p>New York: Guo Taiqi, the new Chinese Foreign Minister, met with American journalists at his residence this afternoon and stated that China's diplomatic policy has not changed and that it is determined to cooperate with friendly countries in accordance with the good neighbor policy. China is grateful for the United States' assistance to China. He personally believes that the United States' assistance to democratic countries will be a decisive factor in the world war. Guo also reaffirmed his belief that China will achieve final victory and believes that China's future difficulties are more economic than military. Although the Soviet Union and Japan have concluded an agreement, he personally believes that the Soviet Union will continue to aid China. Japan is currently deeply mired in China, so it hopes to withdraw its troops from China and advance south. However, Japan may not immediately launch a large-scale southward advance, but will wait for a certain result in the European war. He is extremely concerned about the attitude of the United States. Guo warned Japan that Japan is taking greater risks in the Pacific because Japan has always been defeated in that area and has gone on to worship war, believing that it can profit from war. To deal with Japan, he personally believes that the policy must be firm and sometimes even provocative. Regarding the various rumors about the so-called moderate faction in Japan, Guo believes that they are unreliable because Japan must be completely defeated before a social revolution can occur. Any worldwide organization after the war must have the active participation of the United States in order to succeed. Guo finally discussed the situation in Britain and said that although Britain's future has difficulties, its victory is not in question. The British people have great faith in Prime Minister Churchill's leadership. Although Britain has been bombed, its losses are relatively small, and the morale of the people is firm. Some people in Britain are currently carefully discussing the resolution of European issues after the air war, and their focus is on economics rather than territory and politics.

<p>New York: The New Chinese Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi flew here from England this morning and plans to stay here for a while before returning to China to take up his new post. When Ambassador Guo arrived here today, those who welcomed him at the scene included representatives of the Mayor of New York and 200 people from the New York Chinese community. Hu Shi, the Ambassador to the United States, Tan Shaohua, the Minister to Brazil, Shi Zhaoying, the Consul General in Ottawa, Canada, and Cheng Tiangu, the Minister to Mexico, are said to have arrived in California and are currently on their way here. Li Dijun, the Minister to Cuba, is also on his way and plans to meet with Guo. After Guo got off the plane, he was surrounded by reporters and photographers from the newspaper. Guo made a statement saying that he had just come from a bombed city and was planning to go to another bombed city. This place is still a land of peace and happiness, and he very much wanted to rest here for a while. The scene of London under the bombardment was still ringing in his ears, and the heroic situation of the residents of London would be unforgettable for life. After staying here for a while, he planned to go to Chongqing, which was bombed by Japanese aircraft just like London, and its residents were just as heroic as those in London. The United States has always expressed sympathy for the people of China and Britain who are fighting for freedom. He now wants to tell the United States that the land with firm freedom of belief must also have the highest and greatest courage and the belief in freedom, and that it will eventually triumph over autocracy. This is what he firmly believes in. Britain has been fighting for a year and a half, and China has been fighting for almost four years. The reason why they fought so bravely was to defend the three major classics of mankind, namely the Magna Carta of England, the Declaration of Independence of the United States, and the Three Principles of the People of China. These three are the strongest links between China, Britain, and the United States. Li Shih-tseng also came with Guo and plans to return to Chongqing. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>

<h3>One Week's War Situation, April 18th to 24th</h3>
<p>In areas such as the Gongli area, the father launched so-called "blockade warfare" and "mopping-up operations" in the Qiantang Pujiang River area. If we carefully observe the various movements of the Japanese in recent months, we can see that their military distress has reached its extreme. They have no overall way to end the war, so they can only perform this kind of tactic intermittently, scene by scene, as a kind of decorative action during the combat period for the warring countries. We can still remember that in early March, the Japanese army, seeing the convenience of transportation and the smooth flow of materials in southern Guangdong, launched a so-called "blockade war" along 400 kilometers of the coast.</p>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Commission said that the Japanese military's movements this week seem to be tending towards aggression in the coastal areas of Fujian and Zhejiang. It was then learned that while southern Guangdong was blockaded, eastern Guangdong was open. So, they withdrew the troops from southern Guangdong and turned to blockade eastern Guangdong. However, since eastern Guangdong was blockaded while Fujian and Zhejiang were open, they then withdrew the troops from Guangdong and blockaded Fujian and Zhejiang. Now that Fujian and Zhejiang are blockaded, how can we know that southeastern Guangdong will not remain open? In short, our coastline is vast and the Japanese troops are limited. They are blocking here and flowing there, stretched thin, and only exhausting themselves in vain, incurring losses. Also, regarding the so-called "mopping-up operations," yesterday in western Hubei, today in northern Jiangxi, one day in northern Hubei, and today in eastern Zhejiang, these kinds of movements are enough to prove the Japanese army's lack of a solution. Therefore, it is not impossible to regard the war in Fujian and Zhejiang as their final struggle. A summary of the war situation of the past week is as follows:</p>
<p>Eastern Zhejiang</p>
<p>In the battle of the Pujiang River area, the Japanese continued to attack in three routes, starting to stir on the 16th. At about 5 p.m. that afternoon, several Japanese warships sailed from near Sanjiangkou north of Shaoxing, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers, and forcibly landed. After our army's resistance, many were killed and wounded. Then, the Japanese added 3,000 more soldiers to invade southward. By the morning of the 17th, they invaded Shaoxing City, and then advanced towards Zhuji via Caigongbu, Fengqiao Town, and Diaowan. This was the left flank of the Japanese. On the same day, several thousand Japanese soldiers from Xiaoshan also launched attacks in separate groups. One group harassed Daluo Mountain, and one group attacked Kanshan Town. The main force advanced southwest to Yiqiao Town. By the 18th, more than 8,000 Japanese soldiers reinforced Yiqiao Town and continued to attack south along the railway line. They immediately engaged in a fierce battle with our army in the area near Yaogongbu north of Zhuji. Then, the Japanese again joined forces with the Japanese army that had come south from Shaoxing and launched a fierce attack on our Zhuji. After our army resisted in the Xindianwan area, repeatedly charging and killing, many Japanese soldiers were killed. Until the morning of the 20th, the Japanese again massively reinforced, with dozens of airplanes assisting in the battle. By noon, Zhuji City was invaded. Currently, our large army is resisting in the area south of Zhuji City. This is the movement of the Japanese central route. As for the Japanese right flank, they departed from Fuyang and also landed on Zhongshazhou by boat on the morning of the 16th. After entering Dayuan Town, they increased to more than 3,000 and advanced southeast to Dian Town. Then, on the 17th, they attacked Mao Tengshan, Yushan, and other places in separate groups. They were surrounded by our army, and the encirclement is currently being tightened.</p>
<p>The Japanese army landed in four locations along the coast: (1) Ningbo: On the morning of the 19th, a part of the Japanese army landed in Lishan, Jinji Mountain east of Zhenhai, and Nanhong west of Zhenhai. Zhenhai fell at 1 p.m., and then Ningbo fell. Our army then launched a fierce attack on the rear of the Japanese army, and Zhenhai was once recovered by our army. (2) Taizhou: The Japanese army also landed at Haimen on the 17th, Huangyan fell on the 20th, and Taizhou (Linhai) fell by night. (3) Wenzhou: The Japanese army also landed in separate groups in Shayuancheng, Rui'an on the 19th, and Yongjia (Wenzhou) fell at 4 p.m. on the 20th. (4) Fuzhou: The Japanese army also landed in separate groups in D'ao, Xiao'ao, and Nanzhang Port at the mouth of the Min River on the 19th. The Japanese army increased to more than 3,000. Lianjiang County fell at 4 p.m. on the same day. Another group increased to more than 2,000 and fell Changle at 6 p.m. on the same day. Another group of more than 1,000 landed in Changmen on the 21st and joined forces with the northern group to attack Fuzhou (Minhou). Fuzhou is located on the coast of the East China Sea, and its situation is prominent, making it difficult to defend. Our army withdrew from Minhou at 2 p.m. on the 22nd, leaving the Japanese army to attack an empty city, only feeling disappointed. In addition, in the battle of Dabie Mountain, the Japanese army has mostly retreated in defeat. There were no major battles in other battlefields, so they are omitted. (Telegraph of the 25th)</p>
<h3>Guaranteeing the Livelihood of Civil Servants: Rationing by Head</h3>
<p>Chongqing: After the soaring of prices, those who are most affected are civil servants. The National参政会 has proposed four items on this issue, and the Eighth Plenary Session has also proposed two items. All are now being handled in a coordinated manner by the Supreme National Defense Committee. The general approach will be to adopt a salary system, that is, in addition to stipulating fair salaries for civil servants, they will also be rationed food according to the number of family members, so as to ensure the stable life of civil servants.

<h3>Hull Delivers Speech, Says U.S. Will Strike Aggressors, Should Liaise with Other Countries for U.S. Security to Prevent Atlantic from Being Controlled</h3>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull declared yesterday that the United States must engage aggressors at the most suitable location for resistance, regardless of whether it is outside or inside the Western Hemisphere. In a speech at the American Society of International Law, Hull declared, "We are now in an extremely severe period. To think that we should not resist until aggression has invaded the borders of this Western Hemisphere is extremely short-sighted and extremely dangerous." Hull's speech came hours after he attended President Roosevelt's "War Cabinet" meeting. His speech was broadcast nationwide by various radio stations. Hull warned, "The remaining free nations should, at this time, do everything possible to expand their armaments and take self-protective actions in the shortest possible time. The facts have undoubtedly informed us that for the sake of the safety of this hemisphere and our country, we must resist at the most suitable location for resistance. This means that we must find ways to help Britain and other countries that are resisting dictators. Experience has shown that no country, regardless of its location, has any reason to expect to be spared the attack of aggressors." (United Press News Agency Telegraph of the 25th)</p>
<p>Washington: Last night, Secretary of State Hull delivered a broadcast, warning Americans not to be easily discouraged by minor temporary unfavorable news. He said that the failure of Britain and the acquisition and control of the ocean by invaders would pose a great danger to the security of the United States itself. If experience is to be believed, then almost no country in the world has the slightest reason to be spared from attack. Moreover, just as if a city is robbed by bandits, how can the richest residents of the city expect to be spared? The distance of the ocean may give us some time, but it cannot give us security. Therefore, security depends only on our strength and liaison with other peace-loving countries to prevent aggressors from achieving the goal of controlling the ocean. Hull emphasized the futility of any attempts at peace talks at present, because making peace with the Axis powers would be tantamount to falling into a trap. When they began their movement to conquer the world, they used the name of peace, causing many countries to be unaware of the truth and fall into their trap. Regarding the possibility that the United States' continued assistance to Britain and other countries might provoke some aggressors to attack us, it must be known that no aggressor country will attack because of our self-defense policy, nor will they refrain from attacking us because we attempt to reconcile with them. Our assistance to the various resistance countries is based on a firm understanding that every free country in any place is a fortress for all other free people. The heroic resistance of 40 million British people has turned the British Isles into a great armed base, from which a naval and air power is continuously produced. If the resistance countries lose control of the ocean, then the Atlantic will no longer be an obstacle to aggressors, but will become a channel for them to move westward. Our shield will be greatly reduced. Hull finally expressed his belief that freedom and justice will win the final victory. (Reuters News Agency Telegraph of the 25th)</p>
<p>U.S. Navy Secretary Knox Declares Must Fulfill Promise to Aid Britain</p>
<p>Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Hull and Navy Secretary Knox declared last night that the United States must find ways to ensure that U.S. aid goods reach their destinations. However, neither of them mentioned U.S. Navy escort. They were solemn and silent when they emerged from President Roosevelt's wartime cabinet meeting. In the hours that followed, they gave radio broadcasts. Although they did not mention escort, their firm wording showed that they believed the United States should now take action to ensure that aid goods reach their destinations. Knox, speaking at a New York newspaper publishers' banquet (Knox himself is also a publisher), reviewed the Nazi encirclement of the United States. He said that there is no longer any doubt about Germany's extravagant hope of dominating the world, and the Nazi jaws are closing. Knox also outlined the U.S. aid to Britain and condemned aggression. He said, "Things have come to this, we cannot retreat. We have dedicated ourselves to this decisive world struggle, we can only continue. We must have a beginning and an end. The United States must see clearly all possible consequences. If Britain fails, then the United States may be completely surrounded. At this point, our choices are only surrender and decisive battle. We will not surrender, we are determined to fight. All who know the United States will not doubt this. Therefore, if we do not find and implement a way for Britain to win without us fighting, then the result will be that we must fight." (United Press News Agency Telegraph of the 25th)</p>
<p>U.S. Naval and Air Patrols Expanded, Reaching Far into the Mid-Atlantic</p>
<p>Washington: Yesterday here, there were a series of rapid developments that foreshadow a historic decision to enable Roosevelt to fulfill his promise to send goods to Britain. However, there is no immediate indication that we will use escort. According to various indications, the situation in Britain has prompted the United States to approach a crucial move. The following developments have increased the impression that the United States will soon take action: (1) President Roosevelt convened his wartime cabinet for 90 minutes. It is believed that cabinet members discussed Britain's failure in the Balkans and ways to increase aid to Britain. (2) Congress learned that 40 percent of U.S. aid to Britain was sunk by Germany in the North Atlantic. (3) Alabama Democratic Congressman Mattlick declared in the House of Representatives that the U.S. Navy should now be considered to escort munitions to Britain. (4) The Congress reported that the government is currently studying plans to expand U.S. naval neutrality patrols to the mid-Atlantic, 300 miles from the U.S. naval outposts. New York Mayor La Guardia recently declared that Canada and the United States will defend the Atlantic to a distance of 1,000 miles from the North American coast. (United Press Telegraph of the 25th)</p>
<p>Washington: According to political and military figures here, although the British army was defeated again in Greece and suffered setbacks in North Africa, there is still hope for a final victory. Only if the scope of U.S. aid is greater than it is today, then even if Britain completely abandons the entire European continent and North Africa, its main force will still exist, and the fundamental situation will not change. However, this matter will be more lasting and more difficult to win. The U.S. authorities, in view of this situation, are trying to expand aid to Britain. The issue that needs to be resolved is whether the United States should send warships to protect ships transporting military supplies to Britain. It is not impossible to find a solution to this problem in the shortest possible time. According to news obtained by the New York Times correspondent in Washington, the United States is about to decide to adopt a "sea and air patrol" policy, that is, when ships transport military supplies to Britain, warships or airplanes will patrol several miles away, and if any suspicious airplanes or submarines are found, they will issue warnings so that the ships can change course in time to avoid danger. This disguised escort method will prevent the United States from being directly involved in the whirlpool of the European war. The inventor is said to be New York Mayor La Guardia. (Havas News Agency Telegraph of the 25th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Well-informed Chinese sources, when commenting on the speeches of U.S. Secretary of State Hull and Navy Secretary Knox last night, expressed satisfaction. They told the United Press reporter that these remarks are particularly welcome at this time, because Japanese propaganda has shown that Japan hopes to reconcile with the United States and hinted that Britain and Japan are conducting negotiations in Tokyo to close the Yunnan-Burma Road. The Chinese side pointed out that the only way to deal with aggression is not to wait, but to take immediate action. The effective way to stop the aggression plan is to eliminate or destroy the aid to the aggressor. If it is too late, it will have no effect. (United Press News Agency Telegraph of the 25th)</p>
<h3>British Parliamentarians Urge Early Debate on the War Situation, Eager to Understand Three Current Issues, Advocate Forming a Small-Scale War Cabinet</h3>
<p>London: The Reuters parliamentary correspondent said that the British Parliament all wants to formally debate the war situation as soon as possible. This point was already evident in the House of Commons yesterday afternoon. The three major questions currently in the minds of Congressmen are: (1) Did Eden's tour of the Balkans achieve everything within the greatest possible scope? (2) Does the government need new people? (3) Is production sufficient to cope with the war against strong enemy countries? Former Secretary of War Bally-Shaw led members to demand that Eden make a statement as soon as possible so that the House of Commons can form an opinion on the politics that led to the current situation in the Balkans. This debate will of course include the issue that is currently causing disturbance in Australia, but this debate will not be held until after the current situation in the Balkans has been clarified and when making a statement will not harm the military situation. Regarding production, parliamentarians are becoming increasingly skeptical of Labor Minister Bevin's continued opposition to "forced industrial mobilization." Parliamentarians also demanded the formation of a truly small-scale war cabinet with more straightforward authority to deal with various issues, and its members do not have to be selected from the current cabinet members. (Reuters News Agency Telegraph of the 25th)</p>
<p>Debate Date Not Yet Decided</p>
<p>London: Yesterday afternoon, a motion was put forward in the House of Commons to hold simultaneous debates on the war in the parliaments of various parts of the British Empire. When the Prime Minister announced the parliamentary procedure in the House of Commons but had not yet decided on the date of the debate, Conservative MP Winterton asked the Prime Minister to pay attention to the date of the debate in the Australian Parliament, saying that it would be unfortunate if news was released in the parliaments of other parts of the British Empire but was not released in London. Churchill replied that to say that Britain must hold a debate on the same day as Australia would be a novelty and, in a sense, infringe on the independent rights of the various dominions. However, scattered debates are obviously inconvenient. We are in close contact with the governments of Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and South Africa to arrange these debates, and as far as possible, not to interfere with independent or individual actions.

<h3>British-Soviet Negotiations Have Made No Progress</h3>
<p>London: Foreign Secretary Butler replied to a question from a member in the House of Commons yesterday that, regrettably, there has been no progress in negotiations with the Soviet Union on a trade treaty and a general settlement of affairs. The British government is always prepared to discuss issues of common concern with the Soviet government at the appropriate time, with the aim of resolving all pending cases in a way that is equally beneficial to both sides. The member asked whether the status of the Baltic countries (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) was one of the causes of the difficulty. Butler replied, "I think this is something that may need to be discussed." (Reuters News Agency Telegraph of the 25th)</p>
<h3>New Australian Reinforcements Arrive in Singapore, Strengthening Malayan Defenses in Preparation for Accidents, Local Natural Barriers Are Not Reliable</h3>
<p>Singapore: Today is the anniversary of the Australian army's participation in the European war. Australian troops in Singapore and Malaya held celebrations. Australian Army Commander Major General Pan Gangde sent a special telegram to the retiring president of the Australian Army Association yesterday to commemorate the occasion. The telegram stated that in the current vast battlefields, the Australian army still maintains the superior conditions of the Australian army in the last great war. We are now honored to be able to defend our country together with the Indian army, that is, Malaya. If a war breaks out in Malaya, we can assure you that today's Australian army will certainly maintain the honor of the Australian army in the last great war. (United Press Telegraph of the 25th)</p>
<p>Singapore: Yesterday afternoon, a large batch of reinforcements arrived here, so the Australian military in Malaya is now thicker. The Australian troops are all in high spirits. Those who arrived here in February have been sent to various parts of Malaya to engage in defense in preparation for the Far East War. When the new Australian troops arrived here yesterday, Far East Commander-in-Chief Park Fang led key naval, land, and air personnel to welcome them. The Australian soldiers gave the local workers who welcomed them at the dock Australian apples, cigarettes, and other items they brought. Malayan Australian Army Commander Major General Pennart published an article on Australian Day, stating the unity of the British Empire's troops, saying, "We are now in contact with British troops from India and the motherland. We would like to assure them of our friendship and trust. We feel that it is fortunate for us to be gathered in Malaya with them." (Reuters News Agency Telegraph of the 25th)</p>
<p>Singapore: The enhanced defenses of Singapore's fortresses are generally considered to have impenetrable tropical forests covering their rear (i.e., the east coast along the Malay Peninsula) as natural barriers, making it difficult for foreign enemies to invade. This statement is now unreliable. The British troops stationed in Malaya have proven that even in the densest forest areas, where the field of vision cannot extend beyond ten yards, it is not impossible to pass through. A certain Indian regimental commander recently conducted an experiment, selecting one of the deepest forests and using only a few soldiers, relying only on maps, compasses, and broadswords, and occupied a destination eight miles away within a few hours. The density of the forest is only dense in thickets of shrubs or small trees, and large trees are very sparse, so it is not difficult to cut out a path with a broadsword. After this lesson, the defense strategy of Malaya cannot but be reformed. Previously, there were two theories, one advocating defense and the other advocating offense, each insisting on its advantages. However, with reference to the experience of last year's French campaign, the British troops in Malaya must search for and destroy foreign enemies outside their own territory, and must not allow them to approach the new island, because Malaya's terrain cannot be used for trench warfare or positional warfare. Therefore, the main training of the British army at present is to make them a kind of assault force. (Taiwan Public Telegraph of the 25th)</p>

<h3>British Army Fiercely Attacks Taishi, Italian Army's Resistance Becomes Spent Arrows, Flags of the Abyssinian King Flying Everywhere in Cities in the Gojjam Region</h3>
<p>London: Nairobi released a public statement last night stating that British troops in Abyssinia were pressing against the outer defense line of the enemy army in the Taishi region. According to recent news, the enemy army is currently retreating, carrying out large-scale destruction to cover itself. The positions in the Nichiri region remain unchanged. To the west, British troops have occupied Maki, the center of the Merel tribe, and are very welcomed by the natives of the tribe. In other areas, patriotic Abyssinian troops are assisting in harassing the rearguard units of the enemy army and cutting off its transportation. Also, a message from Khartoum stated that the British mechanized patrol force advancing from Yemakar towards Amba Alachi, despite encountering artillery fire and road blockages, has made satisfactory progress. The Amba Alachi region saw fierce fighting during the Italian-Abyssinian War, and its natural defenses are strong, controlling the road to Taishi. The Italian garrison in Taishi is currently trying to stubbornly resist the attacking British army, and the only two places where the Italian army is currently resisting may be Taishi and Amba Alachi. Other areas are still quiet, with only patrols of British troops in the Asosa and Gambela regions frequently coming into contact with enemy troops. A Reuters correspondent telegraphed from the Taishi Road that most of the remnants of the Italian Governor of Abyssinia, Osta, have retreated to Taishi (140 miles northeast of Abyssinia), and are currently making a final stubborn resistance and building strong obstacles on the roads leading to Taishi, relying on the mountains. South African British troops launched an attack on Wednesday afternoon. The fierceness of the bloody battle was rare in the war in Abyssinia. The Italian army that was holding the obstacles there was finally defeated by the South African army, which captured many enemies and severely damaged the enemy army. The South African Air Force's new aircraft are fiercely attacking the Italian army that is fleeing through the mountain passes towards Taishi. The Italian army has blocked the roads, obviously wanting to take a breather. It is not yet clear whether the enemy intends to gather the remnants to resist again before reaching Taishi. Patriotic Abyssinian troops, in conjunction with the South African British troops, have cut off the road to the Eritrean port of A　Bait and are blocking the enemy army, preventing it from retreating into the Danakil Depression in the east. If the Italian army flees north along the road to Asmara, it will be severely attacked by the British army because General Platt's army is advancing south after occupying Keren.

<h3>A Sketch of Marshal Pétain's Life of Great Responsibility - Celebrating His Eighty-Fifth Birthday Yesterday - Old but Vigorous, Striving for the Renaissance of France</h3>
<p>Vichy, Marshal Pétain, the French head of state who led the bloodless revolution in France to overthrow the Third Republic, celebrated his eighty-fifth birthday yesterday. This "great old man" who facilitated the rebirth of France has now entered his sixty-sixth year of service to France. At a time when most French people, even low-level workers with social insurance, retired twenty years ago, Marshal Pétain still bears the responsibility for the revival of France during the most unfortunate period in history. However, Pétain's health is quite good, and yesterday he still handled his routine affairs for eleven hours. According to Dr. Ménétrel, Pétain's personal physician, who spoke to a United Press reporter, Marshal Pétain's arteries and heart are still like those of a sixty-five-year-old. Although he is eighty-five years old, his physical condition is twenty years younger than his age. His body and functions show no signs of weakness. Pétain has an excellent appetite and sleeps a full eight hours. Such physical condition is rare; perhaps only one in a million can be found. Eighty-five years ago, on April 1, 1856, Marshal Pétain was born into a wealthy farmer's family in the village of Cauchy-à-la-Tour in the plains of Franche-Comté. Pétain's field is now managed by his younger brother, who is a few years younger than Pétain but equally healthy. In the fields near Pétain's land, the Germans have now set up long-range artillery, constantly bombarding the British coast, thirty miles across the water. However, the German occupation forces still respect the land of the French head of state. In the village of Cauchy-à-la-Tour, there are still a few farmers who know Pétain. These farmers were classmates with Pétain in the Cauchy village school before Pétain went to the Saint-Cyr Military Academy in Saint-Étienne, studying together on a long, hard bench. The young Pétain also played soldier games in the fields around the village, and his lifelong career was determined in this game. Three years ago, when Pétain was eighty-two years old, he had completed a long and courageous career of service to France. At that time, Daladier summoned him back to duty and appointed him as the first French ambassador to the new Spain of the Franco government in Burgos. Last year, when Pétain was eighty-four years old, former French Prime Minister Reynaud summoned Pétain back from Madrid on May 14 to discuss strategies for saving France and turning defeat into victory by his bedside. At that time, the armored divisions commanded by German General Guderian had broken into the French front lines and were heading straight for the coast. Pétain's reply was very simple and straightforward, saying, "At this time, there is no way to stop the enemy's advance; the only thing to do is to ask for an armistice as soon as possible." Unfortunately, when the German army was still north of the Somme, occupying only one-tenth of French territory, Pétain's words were not heeded. A month later, when the French army asked for an armistice, the Germans had already occupied three-fifths of French territory. At that time, the army collapsed, millions of people fled in droves, and the parliamentarian system of the Third Republic also rapidly disintegrated. Various politicians fled far away, either in the mountains or by sea, to avoid the approaching German army. Thus, Pétain took on a great responsibility, and in the critical situation in Bordeaux, a week before the armistice agreement was signed on June 16, Pétain broadcast to the public, saying that he had asked the Germans for the armistice that he had advocated a month before the overall situation changed. Pétain told the public, "I view France as a gift for myself. I now bitterly tell you that we must stop fighting. Everyone should stand by my side." Nine days later, Pétain declared again, "Our honor is still preserved. No one can use our fleet and aircraft. The government is still free. France will still be ruled by the French. I will never deceive you with lies. What I hate is the lies that have led to such pain." Six months after his eighty-fourth birthday, Pétain launched a bloodless revolution, dissolved the parliament and party politics on July 11, dissolved the Masonic lodges, and approved laws banning Jews. On October 11, Pétain again proposed an expanded peace to Hitler. Hitler accepted Pétain's proposal within two weeks, and they met in Montoire on October 30, forming an agreement to cooperate in building a European order after the war. Pétain, tirelessly, traveled to Clermont-Ferrand, Toulouse, Lyon, Marseille, and Toulon, and in mid-February, he went to Montpellier to meet with General Franco. Pétain's decision to meet with Franco was the first decision since leaving Madrid. Even with talented political strategists such as Laval and Flandin manipulating, Pétain still maintains his position as head of state and government leader. Pétain has established a national deliberative body with his personal strength. He has invigorated the French youth and has become a role model for the forty million French people in their efforts to revitalize themselves during difficult days. Even with the government burdened with heavy responsibilities, difficult negotiations with the Germans, the unfortunate situation of France being divided into two zones, and the disputes between French factions, the enthusiasm and vigor of the youth will still be maintained.

<h3>Franco-German Reconciliation Negotiations Approaching</h3>
<p>Vichy, French Associate Darlan left Paris this morning to return to Vichy, reporting on Franco-German reconciliation. After consulting with Head of State Marshal Pétain, he will return to Paris next week for detailed negotiations on Franco-German reconciliation. The cabinet was convened this afternoon to receive Darlan's report. It is understood here that the initial negotiations are general in nature, so Darlan did not bring any specific German demands or proposals. The details of such negotiations will be reached next week when General Darlan meets with German Ambassador Abetz in Paris. Detailed German plans may arrive in Paris on Monday or Tuesday. It is already clear here that Germany is willing to reconcile and is willing to offer considerable financial, economic, and moral benefits to encourage breaking the deadlock and reopening reconciliation negotiations.

<p>Random Notes on the European War (47)</p>
<h3>The Complete Story of Willkie's Trip to England</h3>
<p>Although his eyes showed fatigue, his attitude was still enthusiastic. During the half hour when his prepared speech was being copied, there was quite a stir in the visitors' gallery, but he was quietly talking to the senators near him about the war and this trip. Among the group of listeners were the wives of stubborn congressmen, arrogant Washington isolationists, committee members waiting to refute Willkie's testimony, and ordinary citizens patiently paying attention.</p>
<p>Three photographers climbed dangerously onto the roof beams forty feet above the ground to take pictures. At this time, discussions were mixed and voices were noisy. When the copied speech was distributed to the members of the committee, the audience calmed down. Willkie leaned on the table and calmly read the reasons for his conditional support of the Lend-Lease Act. He said, "Americans have two paths to take. The first path is that the United States should close itself off, consolidate its national defense, and make aggressors stay away. He believes that this path will destroy American freedom and ultimately lead to war—dictators will inevitably try to obstruct and sabotage it, forcing us to rise up and fight. The other path is to recognize not only the interrelationship between people but also the interrelationship between ideas and principles. The trade methods of totalitarian countries can only be avoided if a broad international free space exists. Therefore, helping Britain is not actually for Britain's sake but to jointly defend this free space with Britain."</p>
<p>When the government introduced the Lend-Lease Act, Americans were shocked because of its empty content. Willkie's statement, however, put forward various clear and specific proposals, which moved the listeners even more. When he suggested that the United States should supply Britain with five to ten destroyers per month and should abolish red tape to rush the construction of patrol bombers and merchant ships, the listeners were as if electrocuted. In order to achieve unity of public opinion, he called on the majority party in Congress to cooperate with the minority party to resolve all disputes. In this way, those who were</p>
<p>Willkie's view on the vast powers given to the president by British Home Secretary Morrison could be enlightened.</p>
<p>This defeated presidential candidate read his testimony for half an hour. The congressmen listened attentively, and one enthusiastic supporter could not help but applaud and praise him. Several of those who had previously opposed him also nodded frequently in approval. Committee Chairman George asked if any congressmen had any questions. Harrison did not, Connally did not, and Johnson, a seventy-four-year-old isolationist senator from California, also shook his head and said, "I have no questions."</p>
<p>It was Vandenberg's turn. This senator from Michigan was originally a stalwart isolationist but had recently inclined towards a pro-British policy. He cautiously asked, "Is this a policy of full support for Britain? Will this policy drag us into the vortex of war in order to enable Britain to hold on?"</p>
<p>Willkie replied, "In my judgment, only one body in the United States has the power to declare war. If I were a member of Congress, I would never vote to approve a declaration of war unless the whole country and the situation inclined towards the path of war. To comply with the will of the voters, I have no other way."</p>
<p>Willkie sat in his chair, calm, avoided misrepresentation, and never wavered. As a result, the tone of approval gradually strengthened, saying that he was a great man in the United States and a reliable leader.</p>
<p>Next was Senator Clark. He was ruddy-faced, sharp-tongued, and always unwilling to give in to others. At this time, he asked in a sharp voice, "Mr. Willkie, when you were touring England, did Britain hope that the United States would send ships to escort military equipment? Do you know anything about this?"</p>
<p>"I don't recall anyone expressing such a wish."</p>
<p>"Didn't you mention this matter?"</p>
<p>Willkie said, "That's right, I said it according to my heart. I have always been like this."</p>
<p>Clark then asked what would happen if Britain still failed even if it obtained American bombers. Willkie said, "If we supply Britain with bombers and can weaken Germany's strength, our position can be stronger compared to us keeping the bombers."</p>
<p>"Did you fly around half the earth to guide this committee?"</p>
<p>"I flew around half the earth, not to guide the committee or anyone. We need fairness..."</p>
<p>Clark, who has been a senator for many years, often started his speeches with "Mr. President." At this time, he forgot himself and faced Willkie, shouting as usual into the microphone, "Mr. President..."</p>
<p>The audience applauded loudly, and Clark blushed and stopped speaking immediately. Chairman George banged on the table to prohibit the noise and warned the audience not to make a fuss. After a while, he said kindly, "If you want to laugh, just laugh."</p>
<p>Clark continued to attack Willkie's campaign speeches, saying that Mr. Willkie had said that he could not comply with the president in diplomatic matters? Hadn't he said that it was useless and dangerous for the president to attack foreign countries?</p>
<p>"Of course, I said those words," Willkie protested. He didn't want to bring up old cases again. He did make some fierce remarks during the campaign. He didn't want to answer, but it wasn't because he was afraid, but because reopening the dispute would be useless. He also said, "I have tried my best to defeat Roosevelt. But he has been elected president for another term. He</p>
<p>Willkie's Statement to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the Reasons for Supporting Britain is now my president. But whenever I like, I can still disagree with him."</p>
<p>After the questioning was over, the audience surrounded Willkie. The police cleared a path to allow Willkie to avoid the crowd and go to Chairman George's office. The audience discussed again, some saying that this was a special expression of courage and sacrifice, and some saying that he would become one of the most successful of the defeated presidents.</p>
<p>Willkie has proved the legitimacy of this trip to England and his position. Twenty-one days ago, on a cold morning, an airplane carrying him departed from LaGuardia Airport. Who would have thought that there would be such significant results! Since he set foot on British soil, he has tirelessly inspected the islands. After returning, he won a victory in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Willkie's life has once again attracted the attention of the world.</p>
<p>Sir Frederick Bowhill, the "King" of British aircraft manufacturing, said to a friend in London, "I had dinner with the next president of the United States last week." Was it Willkie? Sir Frederick Bowhill smiled and said that he had also had dinner with President Roosevelt's special envoy, Hopkins!</p>

<h3>Hitler's Second Step: To Attack Gibraltar, Rumors of Spain Allowing Passage Difficult to Verify, Portugal Strengthens Defenses of Atlantic Islands</h3>
<p>London - Military experts here recently predicted that the Greek war will soon end. They believe that Hitler's second step may be to attack Gibraltar to destroy Britain's control of the Mediterranean. Many commentators, assessing the chances of British forces holding Gibraltar against a large-scale blitzkrieg, believe that Hitler may not be able to occupy the Strait, but may be able to make the Strait untenable by destroying naval bases. One commentator said that Hitler will definitely attempt to attack the Strait in order to put us in a dilemma. Militarily, this move may be possible, but it cannot be said to be inevitable. Newspapers here are also speculating about whether Germany will be able to launch an attack on Gibraltar and bomb Alexandria from bases in Greece at the same time.

All countries that have signed political treaties with Iraq will trust Iraq even more because of this." (Reuters News Agency, 23rd)</p>

<p>A total of 21 applications for subsidies were received from various schools and cultural institutions, and all were approved according to the preliminary review opinions.

<p>Meng Lu's Talk</p>
<p>Dr. Meng Lu, an old professor at Teachers College, Columbia University, recently came to Hong Kong to attend the annual meeting of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture. According to him, there are currently a total of 26 Chinese students interning in automobile manufacturing engineering at the three major automobile factories in the United States, "Ford," "General Motors," and "Chrysler," all of whom are subsidized by the Foundation. Their internship period ranges from six months to one and a half years. After graduation, their universities will award them degrees, and sometimes doctorates. This internship method has been implemented for the past three years. Twelve students have graduated and returned to China. Currently, each student in training receives a subsidy of 500 to 600 U.S. dollars to cover six months of living and travel expenses. The Foundation spends a total of 12,000 U.S. dollars for them. He hopes to raise more funds in China and the United States in the future to increase the number of interns. After the meeting, he went to Chongqing, and the Chinese government allocated some funds to implement this plan.</p>
<h3>Staff Neglect at Tonghui Primary School, Distant Cause: Corruption in the School Supplies Cooperative, Recent Cause: Teachers and Staff Requesting Increased Subsidies, Desks Destroyed, Significant Losses</h3>
<p>(Dahua News Agency) The private Tonghui Primary School, run by the Shanghai Shaoxing Shuimu Industrial Institute at 253 Malong Road in the French Concession of this city, suddenly experienced a staff neglect storm yesterday afternoon. According to the Dahua News Agency reporter's investigation, the matter is as follows: Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the cost of living has increased day by day. The school's teachers have repeatedly requested subsidies. The school has increased subsidies three times, the first time by 8 yuan, the second time by 7 yuan, and the third time by 5 yuan, for a total of 20 yuan. At the end of the aforementioned term, the teachers again requested the Board of Directors to add subsidies due to the hardship of life. The Board of Directors decided to add 10 yuan after increasing tuition fees this semester due to limited school revenue. However, meals were to be handled by the teachers themselves, and another 20 yuan was subsidized. According to the original salary of the school's teachers, the lowest was 40 yuan. Together with the subsidies, they could get 100 yuan. The highest, including seniority pay, etc., was around 120 yuan. The two parties could have lived in peace, but at the beginning of this semester, it was discovered that the accounts of the school's student supplies cooperative did not match, so a request was made to the Board of Directors to investigate. After the Board of Directors investigated and found that it was true, the person in charge of the supplies cooperative was dismissed, and the principal was deemed to have failed to supervise, but there were no punishments. The teachers felt that the resolution of the Board of Directors seemed unfair to the principal, so they applied for reconsideration, but the Board of Directors still maintained the original plan, which made the teachers very dissatisfied. Recently, prices have risen even more sharply, and some teachers and staff members requested the principal a few days ago to add another 30 yuan in subsidies starting from this month, and to help with 5 dou of rice, with a deadline for a response yesterday morning. After receiving the request, the principal immediately submitted it to the Board of Directors for approval, but the teachers did not see a response from the Board of Directors when the time came. Some teachers then went on strike in the afternoon, and the school order was disrupted. The students were emotionally agitated and even destroyed desks and chairs. All the classrooms above the second grade were almost completely destroyed, resulting in significant losses. It is understood that the educational authorities have sent people to mediate, and the teachers have also made some statements.</p>
<h3>Qualification Review of Training Directors Transferred to the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Aviation News) The Qualification Review Committee for Training Directors and Civic Teachers in various provinces and cities was originally under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Social Affairs. Now that the Ministry of Social Affairs has been reorganized, its responsibilities have been determined separately. With regard to this review document, the Ministry of Social Affairs submitted a resolution of the 169th Standing Committee of the Central Committee, which decided that it should be managed by the Ministry of Education. It is reported that the original regulations on the Qualification Review of Training Directors and Civic Teachers and the organizational regulations of the Qualification Review Committee have been sent by the Ministry of Social Affairs to the Ministry of Education for revision based on the resolution of the Central Standing Committee. The Qualification Review Committee for Training Directors and Civic Teachers should be organized by the educational administrative authorities, but the principle of appointing personnel recommended by the local Party headquarters to participate as members of the committee must be followed.</p>

<h3>Securities, Domestic and Foreign Stocks Rise Together, Shanghai Water and Electricity Stocks Listed in London Also Rise</h3>
<p>The gray market for public bonds changed greatly yesterday. It was rumored that the Four Banks were still preparing to resume business in the short term, and that security could be guaranteed after that. Financial resources would still be fully adjusted, people's hearts were stable, and market prices rose sharply. General floats rose to hedge, and many parties re-engaged in pressure. Market prices eased slightly once in the early market, but rose sharply by more than one yuan in the afternoon. In the early morning, Tongkang still bought, and Defu also had an appetite. Delong and Hongda supplied, and market prices opened at 2 yuan, then entered customs. After entering, Lianyi, Xinhua, and Xiexing raised prices to buy. Although Jiufeng, Xinchang, and Shenchang supplied, demand was greater than supply, and the price broke through 3 yuan again. The afternoon closed firmly and slightly higher. In the afternoon, news spread widely. Zhongfuhao, who had long been in the water, suddenly had an appetite. Tongkang's multi-party added code. The opening rose by 4 corners. Xinfu and Xinhua both bought in, but Hongda, Lianhe, Xinchang, and Jiufeng still sold out, but supply and demand still felt disparate. Category C opened at 3 yuan 7 corners and suddenly broke through 4 yuan, reaching a maximum of 4 yuan 4 corners. The difference between high and low was more than 1 yuan and 5 corners, seeing the fierceness of the public bond reaction. The closing was slightly lower, resulting in a sharp rise of 7 corners to 1 yuan and 2 corners. The transaction was 3 million. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading, 25 shares of Guohua Bank stock were traded, the price was 77 yuan.</p>
<p>The public stock market opened steadily, and the trend was quite active. The amount of transactions was the most seen in recent weeks. Prices tended to rise slightly compared to the previous closing. Asian shares rose by 4 corners between opening and closing. Shanghai public shares rose in a surprising surge, with 126,000 shares traded. The opening price was only 5 yuan 9 corners and a half, and it rose to a high price of 6 yuan 8 corners to close. Rubber stock transactions were relatively sparse.</p>
<p>Shaw, Manager of Xiangmao Foreign Firm, Kedah Bahru, Bokun, and Oak Limited are scheduled to pay an interim dividend for the year ending June 1941 on May 9. Shaw will pay 2 yuan and 5 corners per share, Kedah Bahru will pay 2 corners per share, and Bokun will pay 1 corner and 2 cents per share.</p>
<p>Botoe Annam Rubber Limited, managed by Huitong Foreign Firm, had a net profit of over 650,000 yuan in 1940. In addition to the interim dividend of 1 corner per share that has already been paid, it is planned to pay a final dividend of 2 corners per share, for a total of 3 corners per share for the year. The 28th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders is scheduled to be held on May 7.</p>
<p>London, 24th (Thursday), The list price of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British company stocks listed today: HSBC Bank London registered shares rose to 1 pound, the price was 71 pounds. Also, starting this week, Shanghai Tram B shares were changed to 16 shillings, an increase of 6 shillings. Shanghai Waterworks A shares were changed to 15 pounds, an increase of 3 pounds and a half. The company's ordinary shares were changed to 1 shilling, a decrease of 6 pence (due to fear of errors in the telegram code, it was not reported before).</p>
<h3>Foodstuffs: The Price of Foreign Rice Subsidy Still Secretly Rising, Hong Kong Rice Already Priced in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice was slightly more active. Although actual sales by rice merchants were not yet robust, the countryside, inland areas, and households in western Shanghai were gradually becoming active. The total daily transaction volume inside and outside the city was four to five thousand bags. Due to limited supply in the market, those holding goods took the opportunity to raise prices in secret dealings. The subsidy price for "Small Pattern" rice increased again from one thousand to one thousand one or two hundred yuan per hundred bags, while Saigon No. 1 was quoted at one thousand six hundred yuan. The market situation was suddenly tighter than the previous two days. There was no formal market for domestic rice either.</p>
<p>The cost for specially milled, small-grain, broken rice from Hong Kong-supplied Rangoon White rice, with 42% broken content, including fees and commissions, amounted to HK$274.10 per ton, which at an exchange rate of 4.8 yuan per Hong Kong dollar, was equivalent to Shanghai currency of 131.56 yuan per bag, or 110 yuan per market dan. It is claimed that 50,000 bags are available for loading in early May, managed by foreign merchants in Shanghai on behalf of Hong Kong suppliers, but there are various other restrictions, so negotiations are needed before an agreement can be reached.</p>
<h3>Slight Suppression Seen in Flour Market</h3>
<p>The current market conditions for foreign flour appear slightly sluggish. This is because after a period of active sales in recent days, the rice market stagnated, and there was a large arrival of new "Can Flour" brands. Customers took this opportunity to suppress prices, while those holding goods still tried to maintain prices, resulting in a stalemate in the market. In the end, "Golden Dragon" brand Can Flour opened at 30.078 yuan, and the newly arrived "Cabbage" brand at 31 yuan, with nearly ten thousand bags transacted. However, Australian flour of the "Clock Tower" and "Flower and Bird" brands, due to limited inventory, still sold for 31.45 yuan. Cheap flour from Chinese factories remained at 25 yuan, with 5,872 bags supplied by Fuxin Mill.</p>
<p>Wheat trading was also in a stalemate. Inland Du wheat had long been exhausted, and Chinese factories were unable to smoothly purchase raw materials. Only Japanese factory outlets occasionally made purchases, with prices remaining around 45-46 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Spot Oil Cake Prices Soften as Lianyue Oil Futures Settle, But Term Cake Remains Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, among miscellaneous grains, except for soybeans, which showed a tendency to be firmly supported, other varieties generally trended downwards slightly. For example, spot oil (futures contracts of Dalian Oil traded before the price limit were settled at 164.5 yuan as of the 16th). In the context of a downturn in actual sales, spot oil cakes unanimously softened. However, the market for term oil cakes remained lively due to the intense speculative fervor, though not as tense as the previous day. It opened with 2,000 pieces of Xing Ji spot cakes, priced at 19.9 yuan, and contracts for May delivery were at 19.85 yuan to 20.05 yuan for the first ten days of May, and 20.04 yuan to 21 yuan, later settling at 20.09 yuan for the last twenty days of May, with a total transaction volume of 20,000 pieces. Chang Ji cakes for the last ten days of April traded at 19.7 yuan, the first ten days of May at 20 yuan, and the last twenty days of May at 20.04 yuan, with over 4,000 pieces transacted. Fei Zi cakes for the first ten days of May traded at 20 yuan for two truckloads. Yuan Long cakes traded for three truckloads at 20.067 yuan. Lu Zi cakes for the last twenty days of May traded for 1,000 pieces at 20 yuan. Yuan Ji cakes for the first ten days of May traded for 1,000 pieces at 19.75 yuan. Shen Ji Li Zi general delivery traded for 3,000 pieces, with May's last period deliveries priced at 20.07 yuan.</p>
<p>On the 26th, 220 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Shows Slight Signs of Easing</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed rates. The informal market for British and American currencies trended slightly lower. The price of gold fell to within the 6,700 yuan range, and speculators rushed to sell after the market opened in the morning. This was initially offset by absorption from Chinese banks, including the Shanghai Continental Bank. However, near noon, HSBC and American banks suddenly sold, revealing a tendency to ease again. Nevertheless, the interbank rate for US dollars in May remained at 5.1875, making it difficult for speculators to settle their positions. British gold remained firm at 3 pence 1/875. In the afternoon, bank absorption became stagnant, while speculators' selling pressure intensified. US dollars for June had to be sold at 5.21875. Ultimately, the market closed with both US dollars at 5.1875 and British gold at 3 pence 1/875 showing a slight easing. It was reported that interbank trading was dominant throughout the day.</p>
<p>**Interbank Transactions Dominate**</p>
<p>Since the morning, the foreign exchange market has been stable, with no changes in the Shanghai market. There was no market for US dollars or Indian rupees. Among foreign exchange rates, the US dollar appreciated by half a point against the British pound, while others remained unchanged. The opening selling prices for spot currencies by banks were 3 pence 1.171875 for British currency and 5.15625 yuan for US dollars. Speculators initially exerted pressure to sell US dollars for April/May at 5.1875, creating a slight upward pressure. However, because the Shanghai Continental Bank and other banks successively absorbed the supply, the actual closing price remained at 5.15625 yuan. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. Later, the market remained quite stable. Around 11:30 AM, HSBC and a certain American bank collectively sold April/May US dollars to McCargar and a certain Chinese bank, still at 5.1875 yuan. However, by the noon close, the US dollar was still at 5.15625 yuan, while British currency had strengthened to 3 pence 1/875.</p>
<p>**Speculation Arises, Sales Increase**</p>
<p>In the afternoon, foreign banks again engaged in interbank trading of US dollars for May at 5.1875. Speculators rushed to sell, and then sold US dollars for June at 5.21875. The market situation was quite relaxed. At the 4:00 PM close, the spot rate and the May futures rate for both British currency were 3 pence 1/875, and the US dollar was 5.185, both higher than the previous day's closing price by 0.015625, and the US dollar higher by 0.03125.</p>
<p>**Hong Kong British and American Currencies Remain Stable**</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 25th (Friday) dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning, with no gains or losses in any currency. (Note that the Shanghai spot exchange rate closed at 470 yuan yesterday.)

The informal rate for "Joint Notes" was expensive at 1.75 yuan, to 49.25 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Declines Again as Supply Increases</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market, both the spot market and the informal market, fluctuated and declined, with prices retreating to within the 6,700 yuan range. It was reported that the four major Chinese banks would resume operations at the beginning of next week, and people's sentiment gradually stabilized. Foreign exchange also reported easing, and Anglo-American commercial banks such as HSBC supplied gold for sale. The trend of selling in the market did not cease. Gold shops and exchange merchants, such as Xinyuan, competed to sell, and long positions were continuously cut. The price, which opened in the morning at 6,720 yuan, steadily declined, reaching a low of 6,668 yuan in the afternoon. Finally, support from Shanghai-based firms covering short positions pushed the price up to 6,679 yuan, a decrease of 30 yuan. The market was even weaker after the close. A total of 30,000 taels were traded throughout the day. The premium for swapping (April to May) was high, with sellers offering a larger premium to buyers. Xinyuan offered 900 taels at a price of 45 yuan, followed by an additional 400 taels offered by Lintai at 50 yuan, which were bought by Yiyuan. In the afternoon, Yida offered an additional 700 taels to Yuji at a price of 50 yuan. No spot transactions were made throughout the day. Sellers were asking for a premium of 160 yuan over the term delivery price, while buyers were only offering a premium of 150 yuan, a decrease of more than 40 yuan compared to the previous day. Ornamental gold was also quoted down by 5 yuan, to 705 yuan.</p>
<p>**Spot Gold Continues to Decline by 30 Yuan**</p>
<p>Since the morning, the opening price per bar (10 taels) with a fineness of 0.15 was 6,720 yuan, an increase of 11 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. Xinfeng Yong, Rencheng Yong, and Yifeng sold off, and the price declined rapidly, retreating to 6,695 yuan. However, foreign exchange remained stable and did not ease. Cheng Ji, Yida, Hesheng, Defu, and Dafeng came forward to support the market, and the price was pushed up to 6,718 yuan. Xinyuan, Yiyuan, and Xinfeng Yong sold off, and the price hovered slightly around 6,710 yuan. Until noon, when HSBC sold US dollars at 5 yuan, the market saw further downward pressure to within 6,700 yuan, to 6,685 yuan, as retail investors also sold. Cheng Ji bought in, and the price was pushed up again. The noon close was 6,704 yuan. The opening price at 2 PM in the afternoon was 6,702 yuan, a decrease of 2 yuan compared to the noon close. The price then fell to 6,705 yuan. Xinyuan, Yili, Gongda, Dafeng, and Xinfeng Yong successively sold off, and as foreign exchange tended to ease, the price declined by about 30 yuan, retreating to 6,668 yuan. Because Tianyuan and Deda bought in, and Xinfeng Yong repurchased, with support from Shanghai firms covering short positions, the price immediately rebounded to 6,680 yuan. The market closed at 4 PM at 6,679 yuan, a further decrease of 30 yuan compared to the previous night's close, and was settled at 6,713 yuan, based on the May US dollar price of 5 yuan, a decrease of 30 yuan. After the close, the price further declined to 6,670 yuan, finally settling at 72-73 yuan. The overall fluctuation was 51 yuan. The selling price of genuine gold from spot gold shops was 170 yuan higher than the spot gold futures price, and the buying price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for spot gold.</p>
<p>**Ornamental Gold Quoted Down by 5 Yuan Yesterday**</p>
<p>The exchange price for gold jewelry from gold shops was quoted down by 5 yuan by Datonghang and Xintonhang at 11:30 AM, to 705 yuan (the purchase price was reduced by 40 yuan).</p>
<h3>Gold Sovereigns Suddenly in Demand, Rise by One Yuan Alone</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw fluctuating and declining spot gold prices. However, British and American gold sovereigns suddenly experienced demand, and their market prices each rose by one yuan. British gold notes remained stable, and the market price stood at par. The rise and fall of American gold notes were still very sudden, ultimately closing down by one cent and three points. The evening market retreated to 18 yuan and 85 cents. Hong Kong notes were evenly supplied and demanded, and the market price remained flat. Japanese gold notes remained unchanged, and the evening market remained at 2 yuan and 10 cents, the original price. Korean notes experienced a slight increase in demand, and the evening market rose to 1 yuan and 85 cents.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: War in Eastern Zhejiang Escalates, Hindering Inland Transportation of Yarn and Cloth Again, Long Positions in Double Horse Yarn Being Sold Off</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending downwards, with the trend shifting from fluctuation to weakness. This is due to the sluggish sales of current yarn, coupled with the escalation of the war in eastern Zhejiang, which has hindered the inland transportation of yarn and cloth again. As a result, market sentiment is depressed, and short sellers are actively trading. Some long positions, recognizing the unfavorable environment, are gradually selling off. At the same time, certain entities are opening very large short positions and remaining unmoved. Therefore, there seems to be an excess of positions on the table, and with the imminent resumption of operations by the four major banks and the stability of foreign exchange, those holding long positions are showing slight uneasiness. As a result, talk of a price decline is rampant again. The general consensus is that a sharp decline is unlikely, and that one can buy in at 1,450 yuan. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 5,492 yuan, and the low price was 1,484 yuan. The initial trade in the afternoon was at 1,486 yuan, followed by a decline in the spot gold price to 1,479 yuan, with the final price being 1,481-82 yuan. Today, 165 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The opening for Double Horse yarn was mediocre, as there were very few positive factors in the material market, and market sentiment was weak. The initial price was 1,488 yuan, and shortly thereafter it rose slightly to 1,492 yuan. Soon after, the spot gold market also opened peacefully, and as a result, trading on the market was extremely light. The market price once fluctuated between 90 yuan and 88 yuan. Then, news of weak sales emerged, and long positions were being closed, causing the market to quietly ease. By 11:30 AM, the price had fallen to 1,484 yuan, but short covering by scalpers brought the closing price back to 1,487 yuan. According to the intraday transaction statistics, 6,135 bales were traded. The quantity purchased by each sector is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 135 bales</p>
<p>Counterparties: 6,000 bales</p>
<p>Total: 6,135 bales</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Dark and Gloomy Amidst Talk of Production Cuts</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is extremely dark and gloomy, with trading activity being unusually sluggish. This is due to the weakness of the yarn market and factory shutdowns, as well as the significant decline in foreign cotton prices, which has caused market sentiment to deteriorate. Yesterday, the only spot cotton transaction was 200 bales of Tong Yujin fire machine cotton, with the warehouse delivery price at 196 yuan.</p>
<p>Another report indicates that foreign cotton trading in Shanghai foreign firms seems quieter than before. This is because the international situation has been quite critical in recent days, causing people to be apprehensive. At the same time, due to the trending decline in the current yarn market and the impending reality of production cuts in yarn factories, the willingness to purchase has weakened, and the market situation has also softened slightly.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market remains volatile and uneven, with the decline due to long position liquidations and selling by Southern firms. Yesterday's closing prices were lower than the previous day by 3-5 points.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially rose due to short covering, then stabilized due to selling by cotton merchants. However, it later rose due to reactions to field reports. At the same time, European exporters continued to buy, pushing the market forward. As a result, closing prices rose by 2-6 rupees. It is predicted that the market will open slightly lower by half a rupee today.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Eastern Zhejiang and Fujian Merchants Discounting and Selling Off Returned Goods</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market trend was slightly soft, with sluggish customer sales. Merchants from eastern Zhejiang and Fujian are continuing to sell off un-shipped and returned goods cheaply, according to the market. However, counterparts and stockists are holding firm to their inventories. Factory futures prices are again being raised, which goes against the lower prices in the market. Yesterday, white goods, fine cloth, and twill fell by 25 cents, while coarse cloth fell by 25 cents to 50 cents. Selling prices for bleached and dyed cloth saw mixed increases and decreases. About 200 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street. Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Southeast Asian merchants traded over 200 pieces of Yihua and Lunyuan bleached cloth, blue cloth, patterned cloth, and flannel. Today, 180 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Market sentiment is weak, due to limited sales and the selling off of goods by individual merchants. The closing price for white goods, fine cloth, and the current warehouse receipt market was 51.15 yuan. Junzi Serge was priced at 1.5415 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Drop Sharply, Falling One to Five Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend remained weak, with prices dropping sharply and consistently. The international situation also showed signs of easing, leaving long positions with nothing to rely on, and there was considerable selling. As a result, prices became softer. The Exchange's settlement price for spot goods of No. 24 raw white sugar was 99.5 yuan to 109 yuan, down by 3 yuan. Futures deliveries at the end of April initially tightened then eased, opening at 101 yuan, then rising slightly to 101.5, 101.2, and 101 yuan, before falling back into the 100 yuan range to 100.008, 100.007, 100.005, 99 yuan, 99.5, 99.6, 99.5, 99.1, and 99.2. Deliveries on May 10 initially cost 102 yuan, 102.8, 103, 103.3, 103, 102.5, 102.4, 102.2, 102, and 101.5, easing slightly to 100.005, 100.007, and 100.007. A slight rebound mid-session put the price at 101, 101.2, and 101 yuan, but closing remained soft at 100.005, 100.008, and 100.007, all down by 1.8 yuan. Due to continued arrivals, Taikoo granulated white sugar also experienced a sharp decline, with B Mark East Warehouse goods at 105 yuan, down 5 yuan, and HHX Mark East Warehouse goods at 98.5 yuan, down 2.7 yuan. Dutch red sugar was relatively cheap at 79.5 yuan, down 5 cents.</p>
<h3>Metals: New Standard Lead Wire Remains Firm</h3>
<p>The new lead wire market has been unable to get going due to lack of follow-up from traders and limited wholesale transactions. However, sporadic sales in front of shops are not bad. There is not much goods circulating on the market, so those holding goods are keeping their prices up. The market price for sizes 16 to 20 is 320 yuan per metric ton, while the price for fine colors of sizes 21 to 25 is still 350 yuan per metric ton. Standards can be said to be firm, but actual transactions are quite deserted.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Water Tung Branches Continue to Be Offered</h3>
<p>Although the disposal of Water Tung branches and Haikou branches has recently been very quiet, prices are still reasonable and the prospects are not without hope. Therefore, merchants are still willing to buy them. As for the inventories in the hands of dealers, if they want to keep them, they must increase the refrigeration or roasting costs, so they are also willing to sell them off. It was heard yesterday that 1,000-2,000 boxes were being offered, and prices were similar to before, with not much change.</p>
<h3>Opium Poppy (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>Historically, the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Indians knew how to cultivate and utilize it since more than 1,000 years B.C. For example, Homer tells us in the Iliad that Helen, the beauty who caused the Trojan War in the 12th century B.C., personally poured "wine of oblivion" for her husband's comrades - those melancholy warriors. This wine of oblivion contained opium ingredients. As for Helen's knowledge of this secret recipe, it was taught to her by an Egyptian witch. The Greek myth of "Hypnos", who guides people to the land of sleep, wears a poppy garland on his head and holds a cup of opium, also called "Thebes juice". Thebes is a reference to the origin of opium, which is not the famous Greek city, but also Egypt. As for Heracles, the hero whom the Greeks most respectfully praised for his twelve great feats, his eleventh feat was to steal the golden apple from a garden in Africa, guarded day and night by a venomous dragon. Heracles mixed opium with honey and fed it to the fierce venomous dragon, putting it to sleep before he could steal it. Moreover, in recent years, European archaeologists have discovered the existence of opium poppies in the ancient lake dwellings of the ancient lake dwellers of Switzerland. It is difficult to say that most of this anecdotal evidence is mythical, but even judging by the era in which these myths were written, their understanding of the efficacy of opium was far back in the eighth and ninth centuries B.C.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the continued compilation of the "Ciyuan" citing the Buddhist scripture "Kunaiye Miscellaneous Laws," it says, "When the Buddha was in Wangcheng, Changying suffered from illness, and he once inhaled medicinal smoke and was relieved of his suffering. The monks asked Changying, and the Buddha said: 'Those who are ill may inhale smoke for treatment.' The monks did not know how to put medicine for treatment, and the Buddha said: 'You can combine two bowls, pierce a hole at the bottom, put fire in the middle, and put medicine in it for inhalation. Bamboo should not be used, but iron can be used, twelve fingers in length, not too sharp, nor too rough. Put it in the hole of the bowl to inhale the smoke. When used, do not discard it rashly. It can be put in a small bag and hung on an ivory tusk or bamboo...' Afterwards, when using it, it should not be washed with water, but should be burned in the fire to purify it..." This truly describes the shape of the pipe and smoking pipe, the method of smoking, and the method of preserving the smoking pipe, with the utmost clarity! There is no doubt that this is the origin of opium smoking. However, who is the author of this Buddhist scripture? When was it written? Can it really be traced back to the time of Sakyamuni? I think even if it was a little later than the founding of Buddhism in the sixth century B.C., it would not have been too long ago. (Editor's note: Buddhism often disparages smoking, and compares it to the so-called. How do we know that this is not smoke coming from an earlier time?)</p>
<p>In the early seventh century A.D., Muhammad and his brave followers rose from the Arabian desert and laid the foundation for the Heavenly Kingdom - the Islamic Empire. Its culture inherited the remnants of ancient Egypt and Greece. Therefore, Muslim physicians were clearly aware of the effects of opium poppy, and the use of this medicine naturally expanded day by day. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>3,000 People Attend the Funeral of the Lone Battalion, Xie Jinyuan's Body is Encoffined, The Ceremony is Solemn, Guests are Deeply Mourning, The Authorities Send People to Mourn and Handle the Aftermath</h3>
<p>After Colonel Xie Jinyuan, the commander of the Lone Battalion who defended the Four Banks Warehouse during the August 13th incident and fought heroically, was poisoned by rebel soldiers in the Lone Battalion Camp on Jiaozhou Road the day before yesterday, all sectors of the country were deeply saddened. All the soldiers of the Lone Battalion immediately organized the "Lone Battalion Funeral Committee" to handle the aftermath. A small funeral was held at 7 PM that evening. Then, at 11 AM yesterday, a large funeral was held in the Lone Battalion Camp. The ceremony was solemn, and no less than 3,000 people attended, all weeping at the coffin. At that time, the wind was howling and the rain was pouring, which added to the grief. The ceremony did not end until 2 PM. Xie's body was temporarily placed in the auditorium and will be buried in the Lone Battalion Camp on a selected date. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>**Solemn and Respectful Decoration of the Funeral Hall**</p>
<p>The decoration of the auditorium was extremely solemn. A plain archway was erected in front of the gate, and the interior was covered with white curtains and blue and white cloth lamps were hung. Eulogies sent from various parties were hung on the left and right sides, including "A generation of accomplished people are ashamed to be later dead because they were alive and happy, and 4 million people cry for the deceased because he died in the right place" from the 30,000 employees of the Shanghai Coal Ball Industry, and "His heroic spirit will last forever" from the Three People's Principles Youth League. Clear drinks and simple dishes were placed on the stage, and white candles were lit. Xie's portrait of looking into the distance on horseback was placed on the top, with his heroic posture making people stand in awe. The eulogy "Loyalty Shines Through the Ages" from all the Lone Battalion soldiers was hung above, with the eulogy from Lieutenant Lei and all the soldiers hanging next to it. More than 20 wreaths sent from various parties were placed beside them. The national flag and the military flag were hung on the wall behind, with the word "Dedication" decorated with neon lights in the center. Xie's body was placed in front of it, covered with red silk and a bright national flag, which was extremely solemn. Two guards were stationed next to the body.</p>
<p>**More Than 3,000 People Went to Pay Their Respects**</p>
<p>Yesterday, all 300+ Lone Battalion soldiers wore black gauze on their left arms and mourned in accordance with the army's funeral regulations. They will not remove it until after the burial. Yesterday, the outside guests reached more than 3,000 people, mostly young students, business circles, and labor circles, who all sent representatives to participate. In addition, the Shanghai Orphanage, the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Center, and the Pingjiang Children's Education Center each sent a band to participate. Because there were too many guests, they entered in batches, causing the entrance of the Lone Battalion Camp to be extremely crowded. The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department specially sent many police officers to maintain order. The guests who participated in the camp also wore black gauze to mourn. In addition to sending wreaths and other offerings, they also presented condolence money.</p>
<p>**Guests and Soldiers Shed Tears**</p>
<p>The encoffining ceremony was held at 11:00 AM yesterday. The soldiers and guests stood in silence, and Lieutenant Lei presided over the ceremony, and then the encoffining was carried out. Xie's body was dressed in Chinese formal attire, and after being made up, his appearance was still vivid and lifelike. Then, ten people, including the battalion commander and Xie's close friends, carried the body into the coffin. At this time, mournful music was played, and the tone was sad. All the soldiers and guests shed tears. Several female students who stood next to the coffin and usually admired Xie deeply wept bitterly, and each placed her own photo in the coffin. At that time, many of the guests were deeply saddened. Then, everyone bowed three times to Xie's body, and observed three minutes of silence, then played sad music again and looked at the remains. When all the soldiers and guests lined up and circled the coffin, everyone was in tears. More than a dozen elementary school students even cried out loud. The depth of Xie's charismatic personality can be seen from this. At this time, the wind and rain outside stirred the guests' grief even more. The ceremony did not end until 2 PM.</p>
<p>**Representatives of the Authorities Visited to Comfort**</p>
<p>Yesterday at 5:00 AM, Zheng Shisen and others, representatives sent by the highest authorities of China and the UK stationed in Shanghai, arrived at the Lone Battalion Camp in the heavy rain. First, they represented the Shanghai groups and paid tribute to Commander Xie's coffin, and then summoned all the officers and soldiers to give instructions and announce the aftermath measures. Before receiving orders from China and the UK, Major Lei Xiong was appointed as the highest person in charge of the battalion.</p>
<p>**Another Date to be Set for Burial in the Camp**</p>
<p>The funeral of Xie was handled by the International Funeral Home, and his coffin was made of camphor wood, priced at 6,000 yuan. After the encoffining was completed yesterday, it was covered with the national flag and temporarily placed in the auditorium. Once the date is selected, it will be buried in the small garden in front of Xie's bedroom in the Lone Battalion Camp, so that all the comrades can look up to him day and night. It is said that Xie's bad news has been sent by the Lone Battalion to his family in Jiaoling, Guangdong. However, it is said that Xie's family has moved to the Guangxi border due to the war, so it is still unknown whether the telegram can reach his family. According to Xie's adjutant, the black cat, parrot, and pigeon that Xie raised each died suddenly the night before Xie's death. The reason is unknown. Was this an omen of his death?</p>
<p>**Police Authorities Prepare to Prosecute**</p>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening News" reported that the Public Concession Police Authorities are preparing to prosecute the four murderers of Colonel Xie Jinyuan, commander of the Lone Battalion: Zhang Guoshun, Hao Jingcheng, Zhang Wenqing, and You Yaoliang. The four are still being held in the police station and will be sent to the First Special District Court for trial next week. It is reported that the First Special Court received the official document submitted by the Police Department yesterday and issued a detention warrant to allow the murderers to be temporarily detained pending the official prosecution by the Police Department next week. According to this morning's news, the Police Department is continuing its investigation of the case. It is reported that Shangguan Zhibiao, who was injured, is in better condition this morning.</p>
<h3>Commercial Banks Exert Utmost Effort to Maintain Stability at the End of April</h3>
<p>Since the Central, Communications, Farmers, and Bank of China Shanghai branches announced a temporary suspension of business, the head office has telegraphed orders for an earlier resumption. As the end of April approaches, industry and commerce have not experienced hindrance due to the temporary closure of the four banks. This is because private and local banks, considering this period a critical phase for loan repayments, are exerting utmost effort to maintain stability in the wartime Shanghai financial market in accordance with the regulations set by the Ministry. They are processing large-scale interbank lending as much as possible to enhance the use of market financial resources. Special accommodations are being made for the collateral submitted by various businesses. The exchange rate for internal transactions has been set at five yuan by the money changers.</p>
<h3>Interpretation of Ambiguities in Shanghai Special District Trademark Registration</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs, in order to clarify ambiguities in Article 4 of the "Measures for Handling Trademark Registration Applications Submitted by Merchants in the Shanghai Special District and Various Guerrilla Areas During Extraordinary Times," as requested by merchants in the Shanghai Special District and various guerrilla areas, has instructed the Trademark Bureau as follows: "Received and noted. The purpose of the 'Measures for Handling Trademark Registration Applications Submitted by Merchants in the Shanghai Special District and Various Guerrilla Areas During Extraordinary Times' is clearly stated in Article 2. The matters presented in Article 4 are to clarify that they are unrelated to Item 3 of Paragraph 1 of Article 2 of the 'Regulations for Identification and Prohibition,' and to provide factual proof. Moreover, Articles 3 and 4 are accompanied by parentheses, making their intent even clearer, thus requiring no further explanation. Regarding the four points inquired by the New Asia Chemical Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.: (1) A detailed list of shareholders and technicians, including their names, native places, and addresses, should be provided. If there are no changes at the time of application, a clear declaration can be made. (2) The transportation method of foreign raw materials should specify the means of transport and its nationality, as well as the place of origin, and vague terms such as 'water transport, railway, aviation,' etc., should not be used. (3) Borrowing or mortgaging refers to substantial loans or mortgages, with emphasis on the nationality and residence of the creditor, and is unrelated to ordinary dealings with money shops. (4) The Shanghai Special District and guerrilla areas are most susceptible to seizure, control, and exploitation, and the situation is subject to constant change. Even for goods designated as prohibited by this Ministry, which are mostly registered companies of Chinese merchants, the required information should not be waived based on a long history. The above four points should be addressed accordingly. The Bureau should carefully review each application on a case-by-case basis, verifying the accuracy of the information provided. If any discrepancy is found and there is a situation as described in Article 7 of these measures, it should be handled in accordance with that article. Please comply with this order."</p>
<h3>Cairn, General Manager of Jardine Matheson, Leaves Shanghai Last Night</h3>
<p>Cairn, the former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council and General Manager of Jardine Matheson, has left Shanghai. After the Annual Meeting of Foreign Ratepayers on August 17, where he was succeeded by Shippam as chairman, he announced his intention to return to England to visit his wife. It is now known that Mr. Cairn boarded the ferry "Manila Maru" at the Customs House Wharf at 7:30 last night and transferred to the "Coolidge" bound for England. Last night, Municipal Council members Mitchell, Minsde, Okamoto, Allerman, and Chief Secretary Fessenden, along with other senior officials, went to the wharf to see him off. Mr. Cairn shook hands with each person, slowly boarded the ship, and waved his handkerchief as the whistle sounded, appearing somewhat saddened. Although Mr. Cairn stated that he was returning to England, it is widely believed that he will spend a longer period in the United States.</p>
<h3>Fighting Still Occurring in Eastern Suburbs of Cixi</h3>
<p>According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, who inquired with Shanghai-based Zhejiang provincial organizations: (1) In Fenghua and Cixi, which were invaded by Japanese troops, there are still mobile battles occurring in the eastern suburbs of Cicheng, as well as Jiangkou (southwest of Ningbo) in Lishe, and Xiaowang Temple. (2) A portion of the Japanese troops has advanced to Yuyao, and the situation there is chaotic and unclear. (3) The Japanese troops who landed in Shipu, Haimen, and Wenzhou have made no progress. (4) Chinese forces are gathering along the coast of eastern Zhejiang, and it is expected that the war situation will develop in new ways.</p>
<p>Students of Ji Shan Middle School Detained</p>
<p>According to a person who recently sought refuge in Shanghai from Shaoxing, Shaoxing fell on the morning of the 17th. At that time, most of the residents had evacuated the city. Intermittent street fighting occurred in the city, and approximately 400 people were killed or injured by machine gun fire. More than 300 students from Ji Shan Middle School were detained and are currently being held in the Bank of China building in the city. The situation in the city is quite desolate.</p>
<h3>"Izumo" Returns to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The "Izumo," a flagship of the Japanese Third Fleet, left Shanghai at 9:00 AM on the 19th of this month and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. It is still berthed at the China Merchants Bureau wharf in Hongkou. The round trip lasted a week.</p>
<h3>Ensuring Security in May: Implementing Joint Defense and Alertness; Labor Day Holiday for Workers; Emergency Measures by Military and Police on Various Commemorative Days</h3>
<p>May 1st is International Labor Day, a day commemorating the global labor movement's fight for the "3-8 System" (8 hours of work, 8 hours of rest, 8 hours of sleep). Workers in this city, believing that the day is imminent, are actively preparing for celebrations. The concession police authorities, considering the numerous commemorative days in May, are implementing a month-long emergency alert starting from that day. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Citywide Workers Prepare for Celebrations</p>
<p>International Labor Day is a festival for the implementation of the 3-8 system. Although Chinese laborers have not yet achieved this goal, they are gradually moving towards liberation. Therefore, workers across the country attach great importance to this commemorative day. In the past, rallies and grand celebrations were held on this day. However, since the war, the environment in Shanghai has been unique, so extravagant events have not been held. The environment remains the same this year, so commemorative ceremonies will still be suspended. However, to express their commitment to this great and sacred festival, all workers will stop work for one day on that day, to solemnly and solemnly follow the workers of the world in fighting for liberation and freedom, emulate the fighting spirit of international workers, pledge allegiance, support national policies, and strive for victory.</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Implement Joint Defense and Alertness</p>
<p>The police authorities in the two concessions, considering the numerous commemorative days in May and the special circumstances in Shanghai, fear that malicious elements may take the opportunity to engage in illegal activities, affecting the security of the concessions and disrupting public order. Therefore, they have decided to implement a month-long emergency alert starting from May 1st. The two concessions will take joint defense actions. During this month, posts will be added at various key transportation points, and detectives will be dispatched to patrol the streets. In addition, national defense forces from various countries, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, and male and female inspection teams will be fully mobilized to perform security, interception, and emergency search operations. Emergency measures will be implemented on each commemorative day, closing alleys and unnecessary roads and bridges. At the same time, detectives will be stationed in public places to prohibit all illegal gatherings, associations, marches, and demonstrations. The curfew will also be strictly enforced to ensure the security of the concessions and the peace of the public.</p>

<h3>French-Owned Water, Electricity, and Public Transportation Prices to Increase Tomorrow; French Municipal Council Approves Implementation; Transportation Fares Increase by 2 to 6 Fen Per Stop</h3>
<p>The French-owned water and electricity company in the French Concession has been facing difficulties in fuel transportation recently, and the situation is no longer the same as before. Therefore, on the one hand, it has organized a current restriction committee with the French Concession authorities to discuss the implementation of measures for users within the concession to conserve electricity. On the other hand, due to rising costs, it will also implement a surcharge on water and electricity from tomorrow (the 27th), and also increase the prices of trams and public buses within the concession at the same time.</p>
<p>Water and Electricity Surcharge</p>
<p>According to a reporter from Pingming News Agency, who learned from the company yesterday that the company has decided to implement a surcharge on water and electricity users within the concession from tomorrow, and also uniformly increase the fares for trams, trolleybuses, and public buses operating within the concession at the same time. This measure has been approved by the French Municipal Council and notified to the French Consulate in Shanghai. According to the person in charge of the company, the electricity surcharge will increase from 103% to 125%, the electricity (motor) and electric cooking and heating appliance surcharges will increase from 140% to 190%, and the tap water surcharge will increase from 49% to 75%.</p>
<p>Transportation Fares to Increase Simultaneously</p>
<p>The above surcharges are more than double or triple those of a year ago (the electricity and electric heating surcharges were 60% and tap water surcharge was 30% a year ago). The decision to increase tram and public bus fares from tomorrow will increase transportation fares by 2 to 6 fen per stop, according to the current original price for short and long distances.</p>
<h3>Commercial Press Dispute: Negotiations Today</h3>
<p>After Lu Gaoyi, General Manager of the World Book Company, telegraphed Wang Yunwu, General Manager of the Commercial Press in Hong Kong, with the assistance of Ms. Xing De of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Labour Section, a reply was received from Hong Kong yesterday. The original text was very long and is omitted here. According to Mr. Lu, speaking to the labour representatives, it is necessary to first study and consider the matter in detail with the Municipal Council before convening labour representatives at the Industrial Section of the Municipal Council at 10:00 AM tomorrow (today) to begin preliminary negotiations. Whether there will be a turning point will be decided today. It is reported that the labour representatives have prepared for possible adverse changes in order to cope with any eventuality. It is also reported that Wang Yunwu, General Manager of the Commercial Press, deeply sympathizes with the demands put forward by the employees, but since the "August 13th" Incident, the Press has suffered huge losses. Moreover, textbooks are related to culture and cannot be regarded as other goods and sold at inflated prices. Therefore, he feels powerless to meet the demands of the employees, but the employees' livelihood issues are also a fact.</p>
<h3>Seizure of South Seas Freighter to Be Resolved Soon</h3>
<p>Customs Harbor Master Sugiyama stated yesterday morning (25th) that the seizure of the South Seas freighter "Tomislav" by the Italian troops stationed in Shanghai may be resolved soon. He is currently consulting with the Italian authorities in an effort to release the ship. The entire incident involves complex diplomatic issues, but he expects it to be resolved in the short term. He declined to disclose further details. The "Tomislav" was still guarded by Italian troops yesterday, and the Italian authorities are unwilling to say when they will order the troops to withdraw from the ship. Meanwhile, it is reported that the British authorities here are continuing to investigate the seizure of the "Tomislav." The customs authorities hope to prevent the matter from escalating and achieve a satisfactory conclusion.</p>
<h3>Rong Wu Society Schedules Lecture</h3>
<p>The Rong Wu Sutra Lecture Society will hold a lecture on the 27th in the afternoon (old clock 4 o'clock, new clock 5 o'clock) at Room 420 on the fourth floor of the Pudong Building. Those who wish to attend may arrive on time.</p>
<h3>Leipzig Fair Achieves Good Results</h3>
<p>Since its opening, the 1941 Spring Leipzig Trade Fair in Germany has achieved excellent results. All exhibits have been greatly praised by visitors from all walks of life. More than 100,000 Germans and over 9,000 foreigners visited the fair. A total of 657 exhibitors, including 18 foreign exhibitors, displayed a wide variety of products, with daily necessities being the most prominent. The number of orders received by the exhibitors was considerable.</p>
<h3>Central, Communications, Farmers, and Bank of China Banks to Resume Business Next Week; Concession Authorities Promise Effective Protection; Rumors of Withdrawal Are Absolutely Untrue</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai branches of the Central, Communications, Farmers, and Bank of China temporarily suspended business on April 17, they immediately began preparing to resume business after receiving a telegram from the head office ordering them to resume business as soon as possible. They have resumed internal operations, and the employees of the four banks, deeply aware of the importance of their responsibilities, continue to serve society. It is reported that the four banks have decided to resume business next week, and the concession authorities have promised effective protection. Regarding the entire financial situation, the four banks are determined to maintain it and restore the allocation and collection of funds from various banks, which will benefit the financial situation directly and indirectly. The rumors of withdrawal are absolutely untrue.</p>
<h3>The Story of Medicine (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Qingping</p>
<p>Prevent Illness and Take Care of Your Health Rather Than Take Medicine After You're Sick</p>
<p>There are also some other images worth commemorating that are related to the modern medical history of our country. (1) T.R. Colledge: He was an American, born in 1797 and died in 1879. He was the founder of the Christian Medical Missionary Society and the founder of the earliest hospital in our country. (2) Huang Kuan: Born in 1828 and died in 1878. He graduated from the University of Edinburgh in England and was the first Chinese student to study in the West and obtain a doctorate in medicine. (3) Ms. Jin Yunmei: Born in 1864 and died in 1934. She was a doctor of medicine from the New York Women's University in the United States and was the first Chinese woman to study abroad and graduate.</p>
<p>In one room, there is a collection of ancient artifacts related to Chinese medicine, including the idols of the medical ancestors, medical instruments, medicine bottles, etc., and shelves of Chinese medical books, all of which are very valuable. There are also landscape paintings by doctors, and so on.</p>
<p>Downstairs, there is a library with a collection of medical and pharmaceutical journals from all over the world, totaling more than 200 kinds. This library is dedicated to the late Dr. Niu Huisheng, so it is named "Niu Huisheng Memorial Library." In the courtyard, there is a monument dedicated to Dr. Niu, because Dr. Niu made special contributions to the Chinese Medical Association. Another room is a library, displaying the books and magazines published by the Chinese Medical Association over the years.</p>
<p>The Chinese Medical Association currently publishes five kinds of publications: (1) Chinese Medical Journal (Chinese monthly), (2) Chinese Medical Journal (English monthly). These two are purely academic publications. (3) China Medical Guide, a bilingual annual that includes the names and addresses of doctors nationwide, as well as health agencies, hospitals, medical schools, medical groups, etc., in detail. (4) Chinese Health Magazine, a bimonthly in Chinese, is a popular science reading material on medical and health issues for the general public. (5) Shanghai Medical Weekly, bilingual in Chinese and English, is for medical experts in this city to exchange medical information, explore academic issues, and promote medical affairs. Among them, the Chinese Health Magazine is most suitable for the general public to read. It does not discuss profound academic theories, but only talks about daily life hygiene knowledge. As Dr. Yu Xinen, the editor of the magazine, said: "We should strive to focus on the interests and needs of the public, and try to avoid words that are too specialized or too close to textbook style, so that the public will develop a strong interest in this magazine and be able to benefit from it."</p>
<p>The Chinese Medical Association and the Chinese Health Association are actually two sides of the same coin. The former is academic, and the latter is for the actual needs of society, directly serving the health and happiness of the public. The reporter has elaborated on this in detail in the interview with the Chinese Health Association. In addition to the nine clinics and health experiment areas, they also run a nurse training class to train nurses to serve the community; conduct broadcast speeches to instill medical and health knowledge to the public, so that their work can attract the attention of the public and thus obtain health and happiness. The public health nurse training is hosted by Ms. He Zhuxuan, and there are currently seven trainees, six of whom are sent by the Red Cross Hospital and one by Renyan Hospital; they are all nurses who are about to graduate, and they already understand how to take care of patients. Training here for another month will make them know more about how to serve in the field of public health. A new class is held every month, and the trainees are sent from public hospitals.</p>
<p>The current directors of the Health Association are: Diao Xinde (Chairman), Fu Wenshou (Vice Chairman), Zhou Chenghu (Treasurer), Shi Siming (Secretary), Zhu Hengbi, Hai Shende, Wang Shuzhen, Shen Jiying, Lu Meizeng, Hou Xiangchuan, Shen Siliang, Gan Lin, and Yan Suiliang. Sponsors include Feng Bingnan, Zhu Erden, Jin Baoshan, Yao Junshi, Ba Lude, and Hairy. The above-mentioned people are either responsible officials in government agencies for health-related affairs, or chairmen of well-known medical institutions and public health organizations, or social celebrities and scholars. The personnel actually in charge of the association's affairs are: Ouyang Zhong, Director-General, Huang Huaixin, Director of the Public Health District, Yu Xinen, Director of Propaganda, and He Zhuxuan, Head of the Membership Department.</p>
<p>How to find a "reliable doctor," and whether poor compatriots can be treated free of charge at the discretion of the doctor? On this point, the Chinese Medical Association and the Chinese Health Association, even in a period of extreme financial difficulty, are faithfully and bravely shouldering this arduous responsibility. Their purpose is: "To serve with the highest academic standards and the most affordable methods for the general public. On the one hand, it is to promote health campaigns and prevent diseases in the future; on the other hand, for the treatment of diseases, nine clinics are also attached, with specialist doctors in charge of examination, diagnosis and treatment of various departments, and the very poor can also be treated free of charge. For difficult and complicated diseases, experts can also be introduced for diagnosis and treatment. Naturally, it is far better to prevent disease and maintain health than to take medicine after becoming ill; the benefits of the latter are not only that it does not cost money, but it also has a great impact on the individual's physical health and longevity. Just like a machine that has been broken once, it is never as strong as a machine that has never been broken!" (The End)</p>
<h3>Temporary Board of Directors Still Difficult to Establish; No Response from Relevant Countries</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury," the Shanghai Municipal Council's establishment of a temporary board of directors was supported by foreign ratepayers in the Public Concession eight days ago, but it is subject to approval by the relevant countries. The Municipal Council has not yet received any response from the consuls of those countries, so the temporary board of directors cannot be established. An official in this city, when answering reporters this morning (25th), was unable to explain the reason for the delayed response from the consuls of the relevant countries. It is generally believed that the reason why the change in the Municipal Council has not been approved so far is due to the Chongqing government's statement of opposition. It is not yet known whether the relevant countries have negotiated with the Chinese government on the establishment of a temporary board of directors.</p>
<h3>Changes to the Limit on the Amount of Cash Carried by Travelers</h3>
<p>The amount of cash carried by travelers was originally limited to 500 yuan. The Ministry of Finance has now issued recent supplementary regulations on restricting the carrying of cash. In addition to instructing the customs and cargo inspection offices in various war zones to follow the regulations, it has also instructed them to forward the regulations to be complied with. The regulations are slightly different from the previous ones. The main points are recorded as follows: If the amount of cash carried by travelers for circulation within the country and not for export is less than 2,000 yuan, the customs or inspection authorities should approve the release after inspection. If the amount carried is more than 3,000 yuan, the traveler must first apply to the Ministry for a passport and report to the Ministry for special approval to instruct the inspection and release. If the traveler does not hold a Ministry passport or has not been instructed by the Ministry to inspect and release, the customs inspection authorities concerned should not release it, but avoid detention and order the traveler to follow the procedures to handle it in accordance with the regulations. If the traveler must proceed and cannot stay temporarily to handle the above-mentioned procedures, the customs or inspection authorities concerned should temporarily detain the excess cash carried and release it or return it after the traveler has obtained a supplementary Ministry passport or reported to the Ministry for approval.</p>
<h3>First Thai Freighter Brings Rice to Shanghai; Rice Shops Limited to Sell at Designated Price, but with Restrictions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market was still in a stalemate because hoarding households continued to drive up prices, and rice shops were unwilling to buy rice and grain at extra cost. No one came to the market, and all the brokers did not enter the market. The retail sales of rice shops yesterday were maintained as usual, and the prices were able to maintain the official price limit, but the quantity sold was restricted according to the stock of each rice shop.</p>
<p>Low-Priced Hong Kong Rice: Hope for Rapid Distribution</p>
<p>If the authorities can directly distribute the rice, which has already obtained priority of 5,000 tons, to each rice shop as soon as possible, and supply the retail market at the limited price, then the rice shops can temporarily not buy rice and grain manipulated by hoarding households in the rice market. The legitimate rice merchants should promptly participate in the group purchase of Hong Kong rice to avoid the influence of illegal elements driving up prices. It is also reported that although there was no formal transaction in the rice market yesterday, it is said that speculators still had private acts of extra cost outside the market. It is hoped that the authorities will pay close attention to this.</p>
<p>Four Specialists from Hong Kong Left Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the Hong Kong government agreed to supply 200,000 or 250,000 bags of special small ground rice from Yangon per month, rice merchants have been enthusiastic about subscribing. In addition to formally reporting the confirmed amount to the Shanghai Municipal Council for record, the Bean and Rice Grain Association has formally organized a group rice purchase committee. It is also learned that four members sent by the Hong Kong government, including Harrah, left Shanghai yesterday to report back.</p>
<p>Thai Freighter Brings Rice to Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the "Continental Daily," the Thai Shipping Company's freighter "Sisuntnon Nawa" (1,997 tons) is carrying more than 3,000 tons of rice and is sailing from Bangkok via the Food Port. It is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 27th of this month and will return to sea on May 2nd after unloading the rice and grain. The company's freighter "Suriyothai Nawa" is scheduled to arrive here from Bangkok in early May. It is understood that these two ships are the first to sail to Shanghai and are of a trial nature. If the results are satisfactory, the other four freighters of the Thai Shipping Company will also sail to Shanghai to carry goods.</p>
<p>The Responsibility for Repeated Rice Price Increases</p>
<p>According to those familiar with the rice market, the rice stocks in this city have reached their peak. According to past practices, the rice price should fall sharply. However, the former rice market went the other way, with dark trading rampant and excessive prices heard from time to time. The key to the problem is nothing more than the following three points: (1) Famous rice shops have brought in foreign rice and grain, trying to hoard it, and are unwilling to release it at the limited price. At the same time, the Bean and Rice Grain Association has not taken effective steps to sanction unscrupulous colleagues. (2) Rice shop employees also bought and hoarded rice and grain, although the number is small, the rice price has been raised by these people. (3) The authorities cannot strictly enforce the rice price limit, repeatedly deciding to be lenient in the middle or cancel it, resulting in a complete loss of prestige and ineffective results.</p>

<h3>Victims' Bodies at Jinshanwei Were Buried in Nearby Public Cemetery</h3>
<p>The tragic ship capsizing accident on the Hangzhou Bay Jinshanwei River drowned more than 150 Ning Shao refugees from Shanghai. Some of the bodies were claimed and buried by family members, and there were still more than 50 bodies that were unclaimed. For the sake of hygiene, it was inconvenient to display them for a long time. The Yong Shao and Tongxiang Associations sent people to bury them. It has been completed and returned to Shanghai. It is heard that the bodies of these unclaimed people were buried in the public cemetery near Jinshanwei.</p>

<h3>Australian and New Zealand Nationals Commemorate Fallen Soldiers: 25th Anniversary of the Aegean Campaign; Now Engaged in Rearguard Battles on the Same Ground</h3>
<p>In the midst of the World War, on April 25, 1916, Australian and New Zealand troops landed on the Gallipoli Peninsula in the Aegean Sea, assisting British forces in bloody battles and establishing meritorious service. Now, ANZAC troops are again engaged in rearguard battles near the Thermopylae Pass in Greece, not far from the Gallipoli battlefield.</p>
<p>Offering Flowers and Prayers: Solemn and Respectful</p>
<p>Australian and New Zealand nationals in Shanghai, commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Gallipoli landing yesterday, went to the Bund War Memorial at 8:30 AM to lay wreaths, observed a minute of silence, and remembered the soldiers who died in the World War, especially in the Gallipoli campaign. A pastor presided over a brief prayer service. Those presenting wreaths included Mr. Bowden, the Australian Government's Trade Commissioner to China, Lieutenant Colonel Mann, representative of the Shanghai ANZAC Association, Lieutenant Colonel Curtis and Major Hamilton, representatives of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, and several U.S. buglers who played military tunes. Representatives from various British groups in the city and a small detachment of British sailors also attended. The ceremony was solemn and respectful, concluding in a light drizzle. Traditionally, a grand commemorative meeting is held every year on this day, but this year, like last year, it was canceled due to the European war.</p>
<h3>Entire Xu Family in Pudong Murdered by Robbers</h3>
<p>Xu Wenhuan and Xu Wenlan, two brothers from Yangjia Town in Pudong, possessed considerable wealth. They operated the Hengshun Flower Shop, a rice store, and a general merchandise shop in the town, and recently hoarded kerosene. Their home was in the town. Around 9 PM on the 21st of this month, several bandits broke into the Xu residence, killing the two Xu brothers and Wenhuan's wife. All cash and valuables were looted, and before leaving, the bandits destroyed all the furniture in the house. The robbers escaped with their loot, worth tens of thousands [of dollars]. After the incident, family members discovered what had happened and reported it to the local authorities, who are now searching for the perpetrators. It is said that Xu Wenhuan had considerable influence in the town, in addition to running his shops, he served as the head of the security corps. According to some, this robbery-murder case is different from ordinary robberies, as the robbers not only stole property but also destroyed the furniture in the house, suggesting they had other intentions.</p>
<h3>Righteous Man, Butfans, Suddenly Disappears</h3>
<p>Italian Butfans, 68 years old, arrived in Shanghai last November and resided in the Cathay Hotel. According to information obtained yesterday, Butfans disappeared suddenly ten days ago. The Cathay Hotel management reported the disappearance to the French Police yesterday. The police have begun an investigation but have found no leads. His niece, Katie, is also missing. According to reliable sources, Butfans is a famous banker, and a street in Paris named Butfans Street is named after him. According to one of Butfans' acquaintances, Butfans was on a world tour last year and stayed in Beijing for some time before coming to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Spring Cocoons Nearing Market: Silk Reeling Factories Prepare to Resume Production</h3>
<p>Shanghai silk reeling factories have mostly reduced or suspended operations since the winter of last year due to difficulties in transporting raw materials and the decline in overseas raw silk trade. With the spring cocoons soon to be on the market, silkworm farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are selling their stored dry cocoons, and a few have been transported to Shanghai. Consequently, several factories have recently reopened. The hatching of spring silkworms has begun in various regions. According to estimates from the silk reeling industry, if the weather is favorable, the harvest of spring silkworms from Jiangsu and Zhejiang alone will exceed twenty [thousand] piculs.</p>
<h3>French Avenue Bund: Vietnamese Police Officer Robbed of Gun; Call for Assistance Leads to Capture of One Bandit Shot; Six Robbers in Pingji Road Case Captured</h3>
<p>At 5 AM yesterday, a Vietnamese police officer, No. 158, from the French Concession's Meilan Police Station, was on duty in front of No. 25, opposite the French Consulate on French Avenue near the Bund, when four bandits suddenly rushed up, threatened him with guns, and robbed him of his service pistol worn on his waist. They fled eastward towards the Bund. After being robbed of his gun, the Vietnamese police officer shouted for help, blew his whistle, and called for assistance from other police officers. Hearing the call, patrol officers on duty in front of the French Consulate helped chase the bandits and opened fire. The bandits also opened fire to resist arrest. Over ten shots were exchanged, resulting in one bandit being shot and captured. A pistol was recovered. The remaining bandits escaped with the stolen pistol. The patrol officers took the wounded bandit back to the police station and then to the hospital for treatment. The French Police have dispatched detectives to apprehend the remaining fugitives and bring them to justice.</p>
<p>Pingji Road</p>
<p>Cai Wenyuan, a native of Pudong and an employee of the Fuxing Foreign Firm, lived at No. 1 Yongkang Lane, at the intersection of Lafayette Road, and rented his three-story house to the family of Li Caijie, who worked at the Jianghai Customs. At 9 AM yesterday, six bandits broke in, one guarding the back door and five entering the house. Two held Mauser pistols, one held a handgun, and two were unarmed.</p>
<p>Rushing Upstairs</p>
<p>They first searched Cai Wenyuan's home and then went upstairs to search Li Caijie's room, taking about half an hour. Neighbors of the victims became aware of the situation and secretly reported it to the French Police, who dispatched a large number of armed Chinese and Western detectives in police vehicles to surround the house from the front and back and enter to make arrests. The bandits, realizing they had been exposed and could not escape, did not resist and surrendered.</p>
<p>Surrendered</p>
<p>Two Mauser pistols, one handgun, and dozens of bullets were seized and taken back to the police station for questioning. According to their confessions, the six bandits are Ma Yicai (40 years old), Hu Wenqing (28 years old), Wang Jinsheng (50 years old), Xue Akang (31 years old), Chen Jianbao (38 years old), and Jiang Aping (32 years old).

<p>Gambling Den</p>
<p>It was also learned that Xu Weisheng, a bodyguard from a prominent family, is also involved in the robbery. Detectives went to Xu's home to arrest him. Xu was ill in bed and was arrested and taken back to the police station for joint interrogation.</p>

<h3>Spring Shen Temporary Congee Kitchen Information</h3>
<p>The Spring Shen Congee Kitchen at the Huoshen Temple in Shanghai has been operating for three months. The average monthly expenditure is over twenty thousand yuan, with a total expenditure of over seventy-seven thousand yuan. The number of people eating congee is two hundred and ten thousand, and currently increases to over five thousand people every day, requiring a large amount of funds. Although the Price Stabilization Committee provides hundreds of bags of low-priced broken rice, it is still insufficient. A directors' meeting was held yesterday to discuss everything. However, financial resources are limited. Because the Jisheng Society has advanced too much money, and now it is a lean season, it is difficult to stop operations. The consensus is to continue for three months and see how the funding comes in before deciding what to do. Many residents in the Nanshi area are poor refugees who struggle to find enough to eat. Since the congee kitchen opened, many have survived. Shanghai is not short of philanthropists who generously donate to support this charitable cause, which brings greater merit than any other form of charity.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor: I have just read the news item in your newspaper on April 13, which states, "Chenghang Pawnshop Suspends Business After Robbery; Two Apprentices Arrested." I am extremely surprised. After the two apprentices left, their parents inquired with the shop, and were told that they had done nothing wrong, had not been reprimanded, had not interacted with outsiders, and had not shown any dissatisfaction in their work. However, prior to their departure, they had taken several 2.5-inch photos of themselves and repeatedly discussed their travel expenses to Ningbo, and paid close attention to maps, suggesting they might first go to Ningbo and then proceed to the rear. The parents found the shop's account credible. Because the father was related to the shop owner, Wu Huaiqing, he did not press the matter further and only asked for a missing person advertisement to be published. Now, ten days later, a robbery and murder case occurred at the pawnshop, and the parents feel fortunate that the two apprentices' prior departure spared them from disaster. However, news has come that the two apprentices are suspected of being involved in the case. Given that the two apprentices are still children (both under 16), how could they commit murder and robbery? They grew up in Pudong and only arrived at the shop last year. Under the shop owner's guidance, they were usually highly regarded. There is no reason for them to collude with bandits. Furthermore, both apprentices are related to the shop owner. Even if one had a fleeting evil thought, it would not lead to such mutual depravity. To suspect them of involvement in the case simply because the incident occurred after they left, and to arbitrarily slander them, completely ignoring that there was a specific reason for their departure, is to treat them very lightly. It is truly a case of "when the city gate catches fire, the fish in the moat suffer." If the two apprentices are indeed in the police station, as we are told, the parents have not received any notification and cannot provide proof. However, the detailed account of the Chenghang Pawnshop's suspension of business, the holding of pawned items, etc., while omitting any mention of the date of the apprentices' capture, the location of the arrest, and their names, etc., suggests an intentional slander and ulterior motives. However, the parents dare to solemnly declare to the world that even if the two apprentices face unexpected difficulties and hardships after their departure, they would never commit illegal or immoral acts. As the saying goes, "No one knows a son like his father." Therefore, I specially submit this letter, hoping that it will be published in the "Letters to the Editor" column for correction. Sincerely, Hu Hongdou and Zhu Xingen. 23rd day of the 4th month.</p>

<h3>A Female Switchboard Operator</h3>
<p>— Xiao Yun</p>
<p>In the war-torn England, heroic little stories are constantly emerging.</p>
<p>It's a very simple thing. A female switchboard operator in a hospital, after the hospital was bombed, was pinned under the rubble. But she remained calm and composed, and continued to perform her duties. Most touching of all, in that dangerous bombed area, in that unnatural and uncomfortable position, she continued to answer one hundred and twenty-two calls until someone came to rescue her.</p>
<p>A switchboard operator may be a humble position, and switchboard operation may be a simple task, but as long as she can stand her ground, she has made her greatest contribution. She is as admirable as the soldiers on the front lines.</p>

<h3>Red Candle Tears</h3>
<p>— Qiu Sheng</p>
<p>I am a young woman who became a widow before marriage; because after the engagement, my fiancé died.</p>
<p>My sister-in-law is a "widow" after being a newlywed for almost a year; because my elder brother said goodbye to my sister-in-law forever after eleven months of marriage.</p>
<p>My aunt is also a widow, and she is now an old lady in her fifties. But my mother told us: When my uncle passed away, she was younger than us.</p>
<p>Our family confines these three awkward figures.</p>
<p>My parents often praised my aunt's "chastity" in front of us, especially in front of my sister-in-law. I don't know what they meant.</p>
<p>Logically, my aunt should be happy to receive praise from others; but she wasn't — she often leaned against the door, looking at the sky, sighing at the white clouds; she never wanted to talk about my uncle; she would also cry when she saw my sister-in-law crying. It is said that my aunt and uncle were only husband and wife in name, and she still does not clearly remember what kind of person her husband was.</p>
<p>Before my aunt married, my uncle had already been suffering from lung disease and had been bedridden for more than half a year; I don't know how many famous doctors had been consulted. But responding to the proverb that "a true illness has no cure," medicine ultimately failed to cure my uncle's illness.</p>
<p>Parents' love for their children is meticulous; but humans are also selfish animals. Although my uncle was already terminally ill, my grandparents still held on tightly to their dying son, trying their best to find a glimmer of hope for their son to be resurrected, without hesitating to make any sacrifices. Although such an attempt was very dangerous; it would sacrifice someone else's child.</p>
<p>The superstitious atmosphere in my hometown is very strong. When people get sick, they first seek gods and ghosts, then ask a doctor, and some even only seek gods and ghosts and do not ask a doctor, and they do not realize it even when the patient dies. "Chongxi" (warding off bad luck with a joyful event, usually a wedding) is a product of superstition, and my aunt's lifelong happiness was ruined by "Chongxi."</p>
<p>It — "Chongxi" is simply a man-eating demon, it ate up my aunt's youth. In the past, it has chewed up countless figures like my aunt, and now it is still opening its bloody mouth and attacking weak women, and no one dares to break it, because it has the latent power of tradition.</p>
<p>My uncle was so seriously ill that, according to many people, it was "bad luck," and "bad luck" could be dispelled by "joyful energy." Just think: a young patient, so seriously ill, and sick for so long, has no time for joy! But even if a person is dying, a "wedding night" is still the greatest celebration in life, and there are no legal regulations prohibiting a patient from getting married, and even if there were, it would not be very effective in a remote village. In my hometown, even ghosts can get married, let alone a patient who is not dead! So my grandparents were busy preparing for my long-ill uncle's wedding. They wanted to use the "joyful energy" of the marriage to dispel my uncle's "bad luck."</p>
<p>Probably the "joyful energy" could not defeat the disease demon, so it offended the "bad luck" instead! Otherwise, how could my uncle's illness suddenly worsen on the night of the wedding? My uncle's sick body made it difficult to perform the solemn wedding ceremony, but people are worthy of being "the spirit of all things," and in such a situation, my grandfather came up with the idea of: "The younger sister will temporarily stand in for her elder brother." So my younger aunt stood in for her elder brother and sister-in-law in the hall to perform the wedding ceremony. The so-called "wedding night" was just the new bride accompanying the dying groom, and watching the red candle that was shedding tears for others, sighing softly.</p>
<p>This is called "Chongxi," but what is "chong" is not "joy!" In less than half a month, my uncle parted ways with his newly married aunt. My young aunt became what the world calls a widow. She has been a widow for more than thirty years!</p>
<p>On the evening of Children's Day, which was also the day before Qingming, my second brother and second sister-in-law took the two children out. My father hadn't returned from work yet, and my mother had gone to the street to buy goods for tomorrow's ancestral sacrifices. The house was quiet, and I saw my sister-in-law lying on the bed crying again. For some reason, my sister-in-law has been more sentimental recently. Whether in a lively gathering or in a quiet home, she often cries secretly. Last time, after attending the engagement banquet of my third brother, she hid in her room for no reason and cried all night. Once, my sister-in-law and I returned to our hometown for some business. On the way, we met an unfamiliar young woman, probably also a widow, crying for her husband next to a coffin in the fields. My sister-in-law also cried with her. Maybe she was sad for my elder brother; but I must have been resenting that man-eating "Etiquette!"</p>
<p>My elder brother has been dead for seven years! But she is still very young, only twenty-six years old this year. She is like a prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment, imprisoned in our "family of scholars," she has lost her laughter forever, and is allowing suffering to destroy herself.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, my father's friend got married. This old groom asked my father to ask me to play the piano. He is already in his forties this year, and this marriage is already his second remarriage. When a "string" breaks, it can be "continued," so what about when a "pipa" breaks?</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(7) Draw a Cross on the Face</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang had followed the nanny inside to see his daughter, leaving Yu Kun alone in the outer room.</p>
<p>On a narrow strip of cream-colored wall between two French-style long windows, a small mirror frame, six or seven inches wide, had recently been added, and inside was a lively and lovely photograph of a little girl. On one side, in blue ink, were the six delicate characters "Meiying, taken at two years old," in a woman's handwriting.</p>
<p>Yu Kun casually threw the Shandong silk coat onto a wicker chair on the left, and then stood in front of the mirror frame with his hands behind his back, carefully studying it.</p>
<p>"Looking at Meibao's appearance, she is a rare beauty. Looking closely, she is half like her mother and half like her grandfather; if even one part looks like me, this little treasure will be completely ruined...!" He thought to himself, and a mischievous smile appeared on his face. A twenty-seven-year-old, still like a child.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the door of the bedroom next to the balcony opened, and someone came out.</p>
<p>"Why are you here again today?"</p>
<p>It was the mute maid from Xiang Qi's house, who often came here to help them with some things and keep the nanny company.</p>
<p>She was holding a bedspread that had just been changed, intending to take it downstairs to wash it. When she saw Yu Kun, she smiled at him in a simple way. Yu Kun remembered that she was a bitter melon who was born unable to hear or speak.</p>
<p>"Ah, that's not right!! This child comes here too often, and doesn't know how to avoid people. Be careful this thing is ruined by her! "A terrible idea suddenly came into Yu Kun's head. "I must tell the third sister later and tell her not to move around these days, it is better to hire another old nanny to help." (91)</p>
<h3>Lame and Carefree</h3>
<p>— Zhi Hui</p>
<p>In the recent field of medicine, X-rays have gained a new application; this good news is especially for the lame.</p>
<p>The Radiological Society of North America recently held a meeting in the United States, and several of the latest findings became the topic of the meeting, including the method of treating lameness with X-rays.</p>
<p>The causes of lameness include bone tumors, infantile paralysis (the famous President Roosevelt nearly lost his life to infantile paralysis), and congenital defects, which cause the growth of one leg to stagnate while the other leg continues to develop. As a result, a lameness of one high and one low is formed.</p>
<p>When surgeons treat lameness, if the difference in length between the patient's legs is within five inches, bone grafting can be used to shorten the longer side and lengthen the shorter side, so that the height of the legs is equal when they touch the ground, and there are no flaws in appearance.</p>
<p>Dr. Davis Spangler of Dallas, USA, has recently invented a method that has completely overturned the aforementioned old surgical procedure. The old surgical procedure was obviously a palliative treatment, while his is a radical cure; the old method can only be used to cut long and make up for short, while his method is to fundamentally prevent the healthy leg from growing too long from the very beginning. This Texas expert has used four lame children for his theoretical experiments in the past. He exposed the normal leg of each of them to X-rays for a long, long time, (it is said that this effect is the same as the inability of organs to develop when humans take rest for cancer), so that its development cannot be longer than the other crippled leg; the end of his experiment was successful, and his theory was finally proved by facts.</p>

<h3>American Film Industry Policy</h3>
<p>— Xin Juan</p>
<p>Strategies for Coping with Extraordinary Times</p>
<p>In today's world, where the global situation is extremely turbulent, with flames of war raging and a sense of unease everywhere, both industry and commerce have suffered tremendous blows, almost coming to a standstill. Although the film industry holds a firm and lofty position in culture and entertainment, it is currently, at the very least, under severe threat, dealing a fatal blow to progress. The tenth decade [of the 20th century] is like a crisis for the American film industry, just as the twenties were a crisis for American agriculture, and the thirties were a crisis for American industry.</p>
<p>The development of the American film industry holds the reins of the world's film industry. Whether it is in capital, actors, techniques, etc., almost no country can compete with it. Therefore, with the passage of time, the impact felt is also the most profound for the United States. The world film market has been almost entirely lost. Europe and Asia, the two largest places for dumping American products, have also fallen into war. The deteriorating situation has given the United States a sense of being surrounded by thorns.</p>
<p>In this situation, the predicament of the American film industry has always been quite difficult. For the sake of the "bread and butter" of employees, if work were to stop, the chaotic and anxious situation is imaginable. Therefore, in order to safely weather the current difficulties, everyone related to the film industry is racking their brains to plan coping policies and strategies.</p>
<p>In the discussions among film industry giants, they unanimously believe that only by improving the quality of film production can they attract a large number of domestic audiences, bringing the 15% who never watch movies and the 30% to 40% who only watch movies once a month into the cinemas. This is a good strategy of "losing in the east and gaining in the west" to compensate for the loss of income in the lost markets.</p>
<p>In order to improve the quality of film production, "old clichés" and "formulas" are no longer allowed in terms of scripts. Under this "serious production" film production policy, literary films and biographical films have emerged in response. In the past, famous and excellent literary films such as "Gone with the Wind", "Waterloo Bridge", "Random Harvest", "Rebecca", "Waterloo Bridge", "The Grapes of Wrath", and "Waterloo Bridge", etc. Biographical films such as "Sergeant York", "Foreign Correspondent", "Man Hunt", "The Mortal Storm", "Young Mr. Lincoln", "Edison, the Man", "Young Tom Edison", "Edison, the Man", "A Dispatch from Reuters", etc., have all had great success. Taking last year as an example, literary films were first, comedies second, adventure films and biographical films third, and musicals fourth.</p>
<p>Although many lower-level song and dance films and slapstick comedies have been produced during this time, we can say that although movies are art, the element of entertainment must also be included. In this depressed era, entertainment and leisure are not necessarily entirely undesirable. Lighter films may allow people to relax, but the main thing is, of course, movies with profound meaning that can meet the needs of the times.</p>
<p>As for continuous films such as "The Hardy Family", "Little Women", "The Saint", "Asta", "The Shadow", "Dr. Kildare", etc., although they still belong to "B-movies" in terms of cost, the quality of production must be improved. And with the improvement of the level of "B-movies", it is not known whether the "double feature system" will be cancelled in the future; it is only a matter of time and when it will be implemented.

<h3>Diana Durbin's Wedding Plans</h3>
<p>— Qinghui</p>
<p>Diana Durbin's marriage issue has been a sensation for more than a year, and now it has finally been decided. It will be held in June of this year. Now that the wedding date is near, and Durbin is a cautious person, she has a complete plan for the new house equipment and the future of her career.</p>
<p>According to Durbin, since deciding on the wedding date, she has bought a large courtyard on Beverly Hills, with a swimming pool, tennis court, and more than one acre of open space. She believes this is the paradise she and her fiance Paul have dreamed of. Not far from there, there is a Christian church, and they want to hold their wedding in this church.</p>
<p>The courtyard has a low white building in the style of southern California, which is very different from the French style. Entering through the huge wall gate is a small courtyard. At first glance, you see a large living room. Walking inside gives you a comfortable feeling. All the decorations are pleasant, and the hall is bright. Mirrors are attached to the corners, which makes the hall even larger and brighter. Opposite is a glass door, and the scenery in the garden can be seen at a glance. The chairs are wide and deep, but the tables are exquisite and delicate. Everything in the room is beautiful and pleasing to the eye.</p>
<p>Upstairs, the first room is the future Paul's study, which is indeed exquisite. The room is small and comfortable, and its width is enough to make the warmth of the fireplace reach the four corners. Many antiques are displayed in the room. Following to the left is a very exquisite nursery, because Durbin's plan includes children. She believes that marriage is not complete without children, and Paul also loves children very much.</p>
<p>In addition, Durbin will have a cook because she doesn't like cooking; Paul likes dogs, so there should be an exquisite dog house in their new home. They should also hire two chauffeurs. She and Paul each have a large car. Durbin only recently learned to drive. She also wants to build a complete ranch, and all the designs are very modern, but it should give people a sense of barbarism there. She has been looking for this place for a long time, and has not found a suitable address yet.</p>
<p>As for the future of her career, Durbin replied frankly, "Money is not what I need most now, so I don't need to worry about it. I want to live a human life, a free and happy life. From now until the wedding, we have no free time to be together. Every minute of being busy before could make me happy, but now nothing can make me happy except being with Paul. However, in terms of work, I still bear my due responsibility. I used to live in a fog, but now I thank God for waking me up and guiding me to the path of light."</p>
<p>Really, Diana Durbin is now working down to earth. The company cannot restrain her, and marriage will increase her happiness. She will have a balanced, fulfilling, free and happy life, and will no longer be busy in the studio all day long. Even if she loses her excellent reputation, she has gained a healthy body, a happy family, and a lovely husband. Look, Diana Durbin's front is still hanging with that colorful rainbow!</p>
<h3>Abstract of the Philosophy of Diligence</h3>
<p>— Zong Yu</p>
<p>Quiet is the preparation for movement, and the effectiveness of preparation lies in improving the results of movement. Therefore, quiet cannot be separated from movement and stand alone. Independent quiet is the worst thing. Quiet that is connected with movement is originally one and two with movement.</p>
<h3>Blood Stained Garden</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Why are Attacking Cities and Killing Generals So Chaotic?</p>
<p>Hongniang turned to look at Li Xin and said, "Now, are you willing to go to the mountain with us?" Li Xin said, "Please let me go home and take a look, and then I will go with you." Hongniangzi smiled and said, "You still can't bear to leave your manor. I will accompany you on a trip." So she said to Tong Tianbao, "Brother, we have rescued the young master and obtained the corrupt official's gold and silver, so this trip is not in vain. We will follow the young master's wishes and not harm the people of Qi County. You guys go back to the mountain first, and I will accompany him to the manor and then go back." Tong Tianbao nodded and said, "Very good, I can go back first. Sister, be careful of everything and come back quickly." He also said to Li Xin, "Mr. Li, please don't let down my sister's kindness again." Li Xin didn't know what to say, and smiled slightly. Hongniangzi then took dozens of young men and accompanied Li Xin, rushing to the Li family manor. When Li Xin arrived at the manor, it was already dawn, and a round red sun had emerged from the ground. The gate of the manor was still quietly closed. Li Xin asked Hongniangzi and others to open the gate and went in, grabbing a villager. The villager was surprised to see Li Xin, and cried out, "Master Li." Li Xin asked him, "Do you know where my wife is? Is she still in the manor?" The villager replied, "Since Master Li was captured by the magistrate of Qi County and imprisoned in jail, Fang Pangzi accompanied the county yamen runners to search the house. Most of Master Li's family property was confiscated, and the rest was plundered by Fang Pangzi into his private pocket. He also used words to threaten the madam. It's a pity that the madam hanged herself in her room that day. Now, Fang Pangzi has hastily collected the body and sent the coffin to the ancestral hall." Hearing this news, Li Xin felt as if a bucket of cold water had been poured over his head, and he stamped his feet and sighed, "Oh, I have implicated my wife in a miserable death, how can I bear it? It's all that dog's head that has caused my family to be destroyed, and I must not spare him." So he asked the villager where Fang Pangzi was now. The villager replied, "After the master had this trouble, the guests in the manor scattered. Fang Pangzi acted arbitrarily and took everything for himself, as if he had replaced the master of the manor. Some villagers who were unwilling to live under him have left one after another. Only a few of us who have nowhere to go are still living here. Fang Pangzi, however, lives openly and unashamedly in the master's room with the maid Guiqiu, seeking his pleasure." Listening to this, Li Xin gritted his teeth and ran with Hongniangzi straight to his own building. He saw Fang Pangzi and the maid Guiqiu, disheveled, running hurriedly to the stairs. It turned out that they had heard the noise outside and knew that the situation was not good. They hurriedly got up from the bed and wanted to escape, but they didn't expect to be caught. Li Xin grabbed Fang Pangzi and shouted, "Kneel down!" Fang Pangzi, seeing the people in the middle, was so frightened that he couldn't speak. He knelt down with a thud, and kept begging for mercy. Guiqiu also knelt down. (48)</p>

<h3>Lu Ming Goes to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Lan Yu</p>
<p>Miss Lu Ming will be going to Hong Kong recently. It is said that her sister is among those returning. They originally lived together at a certain number in Mingde Lane next to the Jinmen Grand Theater on Fuxu Road. There are many new and old furniture in the apartment, which of course cannot be taken with them, so it has been decided to lease the house and furniture at the same time. It is said that the lease fee is 30,000 yuan. However, I don't know the reason why Miss Lu Ming is leaving Shanghai for Hong Kong!</p>
