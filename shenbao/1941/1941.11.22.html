<h3>美國對日和解條件　脫離軸心放棄侵略　日方提出對案包含兩項要求　東京覆訓已到談判續進行</h3>
<p>合衆社二十一日華盛頓電　昨日雖為感恩節假日國務卿赫爾仍與野村大使及來栖　使會議、美國依然堅固站於以前重申關於對日本可能和解之立塲、可靠人士於會議後稱、美國在其堅持遠東之「新政」中「未嘗退後一寸」赫爾氏於各使節離開後、即與國務院遠東局局長漢密頓氏晤談、</p>
<p>路透社廿日華盛頓電日特使來栖與日大使野村昨日復與國務卿赫爾晤談、衆料彼等於週初與美總統及國務卿談話後、會電東京請示、茲巳接到新訓令、故繼續談話、此次會議歷一小時、來栖以滑稽語調吿新聞記者曰、「吾人現作謝恩之拜訪」、野村謂談話在繼續中、是否於星期五日晤赫爾、須俟研究現有之情報後再定云、</p>
<p>合衆社二十一日華盛頓電　國務卿赫爾昨日與野村大使及來栖會議、美國堅持其立塲、謂日本應斷絕其與軸心之聯繫及結束在中國及越南之侵略、衆信赫爾氏向該兩日本使節重申為達到目前談話之圓滿給果、日本必須斷絕其軸心關係及結束其侵略政策、據悉、該兩日本政治家訪赫爾時、嘗携帶東京之新訓令、日本之態度目前依然高深莫測、但此事現可視為有望、消息靈通人士稱、會議者均坦白指出彼等條件之大綱、日本要求大綱總計如下、　ABCD陣綫須鬆弛、美國須减少其對中國之援助、　美國必須對日本在東亞建設「新秩序」之程序、取消作政治壓力、而日本方面則表示願意接受下列數點、　願意不與德國有直接之合作、　願意停止對荷印及西伯　亞作軍事威脅、　願意儘早結東中國戰事、靈通界人士稱、美國要求日本實行下列數點、　與軸心國斷絕聯盟、　撤退中國駐軍、　停止一切侵略、　同意在亞洲市塲與一切其他各國有同樣之經濟機會云、</p>
<p>路透社二十一日倫敦電　泰晤士報華盛頓訪員電稱、聞國務卿赫爾與日大使野村及日特使來栖作長談時、堅決表示美國對於任何協定、志在僅僅承認東方現局者、不能滿意、但準備考慮由亞洲西部與太平洋境各國共同參加可作最後解決基礎之一種行動程序、此說頗為近是、但尙未經當局徵實、該訪員又稱、趨向最後解決之不可少的因素、將包括　日本退出軸心、退出中國、退出越南、（涉及維希地位之各點）　放棄繼續侵略、　採行商業機會中之平等政策、在此未證實之消息中、缺少一至要點、即苟非美國表示願意於此種條件被接受時、担任處理一切事務之確切責任、則不能希望日本予以接受是也、赫爾或巳覺有循此方針進行之可能、至其所及之程度若何、則未有表示、</p>
<p>合衆社二十日東京電　日皇本日接見東鄕外相、東京消息雖未指出接見之理由、但據信係由外相報吿其所司之事項、關於此點、華盛頓方面消息稱、野村來栖與赫爾之談話將於星期五重開，日方代表已將談判之經過報吿東京、正候其政府之答覆、</p>
<p>自由貿易固所薪求　東報謂適與美契合</p>
<p>路透社二十一日東京電　素常反映外務省意見之「日本廣知時報」今日所論、聲明日本所欲者為自由貿易而非土地、文內謂美國今當能覩現任日攻府所注重之要點為自由貿易與得達各項利源日本並無佔取土地之企畫、此日本前曾說明者、日本欲太平洋各國從事充分誠摯之合作、以增加貿易與交換利源及製造品、如美國提出容易貿易　開放利源門戶之政策、當能接受日本西太平洋合作之程序、目前之主要點、為美國與日本對二共榮圈一在大西洋、在太平洋者互相默契云、</p>
<p>東鄉宣稱對美談判　依據三原則為基礎</p>
<p>海通社廿一日東京電　外相東鄉宣稱、首相東條最近在國會演說時發表之三大耍求、為來栖特使進行日美談話之基本原則、外相答預算委員會某委員之詢問稱、來栖華盛頓之行、係為促使日駐美大使野村業已開始之日美談話迅速進行、日政府在遣派來栖赴美之先、即已決定談判、本月初會談即已在進行中、來栖並未携有任何特別訓示、總之日美談判完全以東條首相宜佈之三大要求為基礎云、</p>
<p>澳荷保證共同對日　根據地願供美使用</p>
<p>國際社廿一日華盛頓電　國際社記者昨日自最高權威方面獲悉、澳州與荷印俱已向美保證、若日本在太平洋上對美開戰、則澳荷亦將對日作戰、若太平洋上之戰事爆發、澳荷兩國之立塲究將何若、此項懷疑已由上述之保證一掃而空、現僅有泰國之態度尙未決定、蓋泰國現正保持嚴格之中立也、英首相邱吉爾曾保證日美開戰一小時內、英即將對日宣戰、首相此言已獲得英領土之完全擁護、澳洲此項保證亦有正式擁護之性質、據記者所悉、若戰事爆發、澳荷兩國俱願立將其海陸空軍根據地歸美國使用、以增多太平洋上美戰略上之要地、又悉、中國亦已將其所有根據地供給美國、故ABCD各國已在太平洋區、完成其聯合陣綫矣、</p>

<h3>日推行南進政策　泰國感受威脅　邊境泰機巡邏遭射擊　泰政府向日提出抗議</h3>
<p>路透社二十日倫敦電　泰晤士報外交訪員稱、華府談話雖在進行中、然日本現仍冀在西南太平洋邁進不已、日方旣置兵於密邇緬甸公路之越南邊界、復以軍艦在泰國外示威、據最近證據日方現用勘畫越泰邊界之長期拖延的談判、以作覓取極重要讓與權之工具、本年三月越南以土地割與泰國時、最後勘界事留待他日為之、今日方飛機顯已得飛過邊界　取地圖之權、日當局現且欲利用泰國東部與盤谷之飛機塲、並欲泰國當局供以汽油、此種讓與權顯然極為危險、蓋日人可因此獲得許多立足點而迅速發展之也、泰當局現深知此種危險、而即有所布置矣云、</p>
<p>合衆社二十一日曼谷電　此間可靠方面稱、本星期有泰國飛機兩架在越南邊界受損、死泰人一者、泰國已因該兩次事件而向越南日當局提出非正式抗議、可靠方面宣稱、維恩桑特拉之法方高射砲隊會向在泰國領土上空偵探之泰飛機開火、損泰機兩架、此間報紙載稱、國籍不明之飛機一架、於十一月十七日夜半在泰國之特蘭雅城飛行五分鐘、然後向越南飛去、報紙並載稱、最近有法國飛機兩架飛臨泰國之農街省達十分鐘、然後飛向維恩桑特拉、泰方兩次皆未向侵入者開火、消息靈通方面指出在各次涉及法方之事件、泰報紙皆未提及日本、但抗議則係向越南日當局提出、泰國報紙本日又稱十一月十八日有越南兵士十人越過邊界、襲擊農街附近之泰國某鄉村、村民曾作抵抗、村民一人為越兵擄去殺害、官員拒絕評論該事件、但表示彼等認此事並無任何重要、同時宣傳局否認外國所傳日軍集中越南邊界及日艦之駐在西貢係對泰國威脅、官方宣布泰總理本日曾與日本駐泰大使會商一小時、</p>

<h3>滇越邊境局勢緊張　華軍精銳嚴陣以待　雄厚兵力決能遏阻日軍進犯　渝各界對艾登宣言頗感興奮</h3>
<p>桂林　滇越邊界之局勢依然緊張、中日兩軍隔境對峙、雙方部隊皆屬精銳、估計目前集中越南之日軍共計八萬人、其中五萬駐於東京、三萬集合南越、聞現駐越境之日軍中、有近衛師團、及最近由廣州調　之第十八及第三兩師團、精銳華軍包括機械化部隊在內、現沿邊境佈置陣地、以應付日軍可能之攻擊、華軍當局皆信如沿邊境之戰事一旦爆發、則將為中日戰事中從來未有之激戰、因雙方均將以最精銳軍隊與最新式配備加入作戰也、目前日方在越南駐有飛機百架、康瀾灣附近有日艦八十艘、十一月一日至八日之一週中、曾有大批日軍需品運到、內有野戰砲七十尊、華方意見、以為日軍攻滇之前、或將在桂粵兩省發動攻勢、以期儘量分散華方之注意、於最近所　日方在廣州區域之軍事活動、（廿一日路透社電）</p>

<p>重慶　此間華人各界、對於英外相艾登在下院所發關於日軍攻擊滇緬公路之言論、至為滿意、中國觀察家常以為日本因恐與英美蘇聯開戰、故不致北進或南進、而極似將攻擊滇緬公路、英美屢次宣布日本如北進或南進、則彼等準備取積極對付行動、但關於日本進攻滇緬公路之可能性、則未示明態度、該公路現為中國至重要之供應路綫、而與中國作戰至有關係、故華人至為關切、艾登之宣言、已使華人各界大為寬慰、蓋知日軍如攻該公路、英美決不致任令中國單獨作戰也、美國參院外交委員會主席貝潑所發、主張日軍退出中國之言論、亦為中國政界所歡迎、（廿一日路透社電）</p>

<h3>別矣麥令斯</h3>
<p>別矣麥令斯　以成立二十五年之海軍陸戰隊第四聯隊而有半數以上之年分，駐紮華土，不為不久。君等之來也為護僑，不意於此最近五年中，乃為上海治安之柱石。保持上海國際市塲之中立性，留此一片安全土，為各國商旅行李往來之東道主，固出於地方當局曁各國軍隊共同保衛之功；但麥令斯之助力，常收效於無形之中，廻旋於不測之淵，懸崖勒馬，化險為夷，使滬人雖震驚危疑於戰事之邊緣，而猶七鬯無恙，閭閻安堵，此其功在民間，宜有不可沒者。昔人有云：「黯然銷魂者，惟別而已矣！」雖非可語於偉武仁勇之麥令斯，但景仰之意，惜別之忱，能無同感。行矣！麥令斯，驪歌待唱，征鞭將發，君等未來之職責，有重於駐守滬平；則於君等之行也，吾人縱未能揮巾江干，祖道東門，能不於此一言以致意。</p>
<p>夫駐軍於外國領土，固非以與國相待之道。中國平津上海各地之有外國駐軍，原為四十年前執政之顢預昏瞶，不識大勢，誤信莠言，及亂民之愚蠢無知，濫施武力，所造成之惡果，固非中國全體民衆之咎也。然各國所以懲罰中國者，開駐兵之惡例，挾武力作後盾；所以桎梏中國者，至國民革命軍到達上海後，猶在協以謀我，至有今日之環境，安知不為當時一念之誤，傅虎以翼之故也。而今之中國，雖武力尙有未逮，不得不如屈蠖求伸，但民非四十年前之民，政府非四十年前之政府，五十年興學之功，漸收成效；卽美國文化上之義舉，退庚賠款植學子，亦與有力焉！故英美之相繼撤退其駐華軍隊，自有其戰略上之作用；而放棄不平等條約上之權利，以平等待我則一。中國國父有言：「願與以平等待我之民族，共同奮鬭；」今麥令斯之自動撤退，行見實施之期匪遙，而中國領土內，決不容再有外國駐軍，將以此舉為其嚆矢。</p>
<p>善哉麥令斯指揮官霍華德上校之言曰：「美政府旣已聲明其於和平恢復時，卽放棄在華領判權之意嚮，故美陸戰隊未必復返中國。」此其為言，吾人雖於友誼上對麥令斯之離滬，有不勝依依之情緒；但在公誼上，固不禁寄以熱烈之同情。至謂「除非恢復常態時，中政府感覺尙未能保護美國利益，而請美國派兵，美軍始將復來中國，擔任駐防任務。」以見霍華德上校之目光遠大，思慮周至。蓋在中國之立塲，至常態恢復之後，自應力求其所能以保護友邦如美國者之利益，決不欲使其失望。惟在常態將復未復之際，容或對於美國利益有鞭長莫及之虞，而望麥令斯恃其便利，重蒞華土，謀一時之保衛，固未可知。不然，並肩而立，處建瓴之勢，順流而下，與滬人士相見於滬瀆，則歡欣鼓舞之狀，將不可以言語形容。更不然，此後以麥令斯行軍之便，道出滬上，歡然叙故，樂焉無垠。麥令斯之去也，挾滬人士中心所寄以之無上情感，歸而語其國人，吿其袍澤，以中國人心目中，對於美國軍隊，不覺其可憎，彌覺其可愛；此無他，美國朝野共寄中國以同情，有以使然也，又何止同情，行且見諸事實；而事實之最大成就，為「人類在自由平等中生活之權利。」美軍為美國權威之表示，是則滬上人士，於其行也，能不寄以深切之期望。然而滬上人士，於麥令斯之去也，又起其無謂之恐慌，此正以見滬人士倚麥令斯若長城，信任之深，有不啻如自己軍隊。雖然，苟欲隳滅上海則已，否則如遇有事變時，於遠東留一「國際間之接綫室」，則舍富於國際性之上海外，實無最適宜之塲所。益以租界當局雖屢遭事故，力足以股然於事變漩渦之外，其苦心孤詣維持治安之精神，亦為滬人士所深悉；則此後之一切措施，自必勉副斯義，決不使上海租界有一時間變更原狀之可能。且戰事終必有淸算之一日，租界旣無軍事上之作為，僅為工商業之市場，如欲橫施摧殘，意圖獨占，後果所屆，亦將隨戰事淸算而有淸算之一日。何况租界之地位，戰後當有一番改革，目前已成暫局，固何必亟亟於一時間之稱覇，而忘却日後相見之餘地，人非下愚，當不出此。卽使上海將來因戰氛而恐慌加甚，此則所謂黑暗愈深，光明愈邇，滬人士亦惟忍耐而待光明之來臨而已！故麥令斯雖去，而麥令斯維持上海治安之精神，固歷久不泯者也。</p>
<p>別矣麥令斯！滬人士無以為報，惟有祝君等前程光榮，幸福無疆！而亦切禱早有以結束此紛亂擾攘之局面，廓除罪惡與奴役之暴力，建立永久的自由博愛與公義。謹以此竊比於臨別贈言之義，想亦麥令斯所樂予同情者也。</p>

<p>（四）交通、張嘉璈部長　公路因軍事便利起見、已移歸運輸統制局、驛運雖屬創舉、而運輸量　甚可觀、且對水道鐵路不通處、尤多補助、關於鐵路部份，張氏謂、雖在十分困難情形下、今修築了九條新路云、各方最屬目之滇緬鐵路、因租借法之補助、舖築頗快、</p>

<h3>雙馬現貨套賣殊夥　一早開市即跌停板</h3>
<p>紗市續疲且形勢頗虛、此因環境不良、現貨商套賣者殊夥、以致籌碼充足、所以巿盤愈挫、雙馬廠單晨開即宣吿跌停板、為二千七百九十元、然暗盤下降仍烈、因取引所二三盤各月一致慘落、同時黃金反動、狂跌尤劇、更使多頭不安、賣風益熾、雙馬廠單暗盤塲外最低做至二千六百三十元、至於現紗交易、全部停頓、雙馬外棧貨比廠單奇廉一百五十至八十元、差額甚巨、午後雙馬廠單因跌停板、繼續不做而無市、但取引所以上午大落、午後均見回昂、今日有棉紗一百五十件運天津、</p>
<p>金雙馬期貨市況、免起　落、走勢極度靡定、蓋以海關禁運不撒、而國際間談判時緩時緊、以致謠言　起、倏而利多、旋又利空、如此動盪局勢、乃使人心忐忑、大有不知何從之慨、當上午開出、雖廠單首先下跌停板、而以期紗隔昨已降、故期紗做開、十二月份已停止交易、二月份開始登塲、初以散戶尙有進意、趨勢還帶硬態、十二月期開出為二千六百元、先升六十元、一月份二七三〇元、亦好六十元、旋以金巿猛降、引起多方大為不安、遂相繼拋出、故二月份開出巳帶疲勢、為二七四〇元、軋小二十元、入後二三盤徘徊、仍多軟化、午收除近期微硬外、遠期各小七十至一百元、二月份曾一度低至二六六〇元、午後承上午全市之瀉風、人心多數恐慌、大戶與投機家先多力塞、十二月份竟以二四七〇元之最低價開盤、一月份亦為二五八〇元低盤開出、入後以金價轉挺、市氣突見上漲、各月期先後回上達百餘元之多、結果十二月份尙好六十元、一月份平、二月份較開盤小二十元、茲列表於後、</p>

<p>紐約棉市昨日為美國感恩節、棉市循例休業、</p>
<p>印度棉市平淡而無特色、先因股票市塲堅昂、引起投機者買進而漲、續後又因職業商賣出、及一部分多頭了結略跌、結果昨日收盤價格、漲跌半羅比左右不等、又預測今日開盤市况、仍與收盤價格不相上下、</p>
<h3>人心一致售　金價大跌　軋小二千二百五十元</h3>
<p>昨日金市現貨烚赤暗市、跌風驟形擴大、傾向下挫、價接連破入一萬八千元及一萬七千元兩關內、一度曾再入一萬六千元關、因美日之新談判所引起之利空傳說更盛、各方人心更形虛萎、故雖有銀行幫之巨額搜羅、證券號及滙票商各進一千二百兩左右、德成進四百兩以上、但有祥和傾出一千〇二十兩、祥興永售五百兩、順源出四百兩、明豐軋出二百四十兩、天元等號多供過於求、致價由一萬七千九百五十元、狂瀉見一萬五千八百元低價、較之十月三十一日之二萬三千一百元歷來新高價、巳回低三分之一、下午見低買戶活動、奈市勢巳虛、故價回起千元、即後銳落、終見軋跌一千二百五十元、全日交易共二萬四千九百四十兩、飾金最低一千六百二十元、最後一千六百四十元、軋小二百三十元、紋銀掛小二元、為二十四元、黑市降至二十元左右、</p>

<h3>黑匯終日求售　迄無應者　外幣受絕大打擊　美鈔曾進三十元</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市況、中央及匯豐兩掛牌無軒輊、滙豐等小櫃檯價均平、英美滙黑市終日在華商多頭於求脫兜售聲中、迄少進口商需求、故英匯二辦士一二五、美匯三元三七五均可結、無成交、即在美國劃賬之電滙、均乏人問津、</p>
<p>香港二十一日（週五）電、今晨匯市開盤平穩異常、行情仍無榮辱、</p>
<p>天津二十一日（週五）電、今晨滙市開盤吿平、倫敦及紐約電滙仍開原盤有行號巿、聯鈔暗盤亦無榮辱、申匯獨降三元、為七十二元、</p>

<h3>內債人氣絕佳</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨午起伏甚鉅、高低相差一元數角之多、抬者惟恐其不高、但價高招遠貨、現貨又紛紛流出、有謂日美談判順利、然事尙在停頓中、執貨者乃得善價而掛、其實巿面仍係互相揣測、見仁見智、各有見地、丙種抬至七十一元、尙係近兩月來未有之高價、但趨勢尙未必遽小，昨日上午丙種開七十元、遂即逐步上騰、逼近七十一元、塲內買戶頗為踴躍、同益大中協興元聯益順泰及一般散戶均有買進、市上人氣極佳、午後開盤森記首先買進、大中生興聯和等續有買進、丙種出七十一元關、乃引起金融界現貨流出、怡泰鼎康潤德益肥等進丙種復又退至七十元收盤、形勢恍惚、市價結果、除丁種猛漲一元五角為最多外、餘則略好一角三角至五角、成交約近三百萬元、茲列簡明表於後、類別　最　高最　低收　盤比前日</p>

<h3>國米價續鬆動　洋米轉口運津</h3>
<p>昨日洋米仍乏市面、惟國米曾有送配館米及米店等百餘包成交、北破一百八十六元、新粳一百八十二元、薄稻一百八十三元、中次別降三四元不等、</p>

<h3>東棧粉可轉口　西棧粉被統制　價格立見高低</h3>
<p>洋粉早市依然平疲無神、旋聞浦東戰粉已得租界當局允許轉口、故東棧金龍牌市面立即轉機、價自四十四元四十四元半漲至四十五元、而西棧金龍則貶價至四十元而無人問津、蓋傳浦西棧洋粉已經當局計劃統制、只限消售本街之故、因此將來必多在浦東卸棧、麩皮尙有鄕客問津，惟客囤售憲亦鬆、小包本麩四十六元、蘭花牌客麩四十四元半、開出二百包、行情雖照原盛、而巿形頗見軟弱、小麥到枯、日廠收價仍在七十五元外、</p>

<p>戰爭</p>
<h3>希特勒的軍師</h3>
<p>— 何凱</p>
<p>在過去二年數月間，德國在波蘭，北歐，比利時，法國，巴爾幹以及蘇聯，往往能够對準對方防綫最弱的一點進攻而獲得閃電的勝利。而每次在發動軍事行動之前必定進行政治的及經濟的準備工作，兩者相輔而行，結果獲得很大的效果，這種空前的戰略與政略的成功據說應歸功於希特勒一人的力量。</p>
<p>可是事實上，在希特勒的背後的却另有其人，替他運籌帷幄。那就是卡爾·霍斯好弗博士。在他指揮下的慕尼黑的「地政學協會」擁有千餘著名的科學家，經常地硏究着德國稱覇世界的方策，而這一羣人事實上就是希特勒的軍師。</p>
<p>一國元首擁有這種研究機關在歷史上是無先例的。不論里賓特洛甫的外交機關，希姆萊的秘密警察，郭培爾的宣傳部，白勞傑區的國防軍，可以說多少都受着霍斯好弗的指揮。</p>
<p>一九三八年當德國合併捷克之際，德國參謀本部深恐德軍開入捷克後，法國將隨即遣兵救援，可是霍斯好弗斷定這是過慮，而事實證明確實如此。</p>
<p>預言波蘭可於十八日間征服的是霍斯好弗，而對於白勞傑區總司令的憂慮德軍機械化部隊將為波蘭之濕地所苦，聲言在適當時期進攻不至遇雨的也是霍斯好弗。</p>
<p>在挪威登陸作戰時，德軍統帥部曾感覺相當不安，可是霍斯好弗，保證必能獲得成功</p>
<p>在進攻法國時希特勒接受霍斯好弗的建議，制止德軍統帥部準備迅速進擊的主張，而等待時機的成熟，終至於獲得空前的勝利。其後對北非，巴爾幹及蘇聯的出兵也無疑地是根據霍斯好弗的獻計。</p>
<p>希特勒僅是一個煽動家，並不是胸有成竹的政治家，和天賦獨厚的英雄。他的世界政策大多得力於霍斯好弗，而「我的奮鬥」第十六章關於外交政策的部分，據說也是出自霍斯好弗的手筆。</p>
<p>霍斯好弗是德意志帝國時代的陸軍將校，在第一次大戰時他已擢升至陸軍少將的地位。戰後他退出行伍，担任慕尼黑大學的敎授，講述地政學，力言德國復興的必然性，頗得一般學生的擁護。</p>
<p>他和希特勒認識大約在十七年前，當後者在慕尼黑發動政變，遭遇失敗，被監於牢獄的時候，當時他曾時時去探望希特勒。</p>
<p>一九三三年納粹獲得政權後，希特勒即請霍斯好弗組織「地政學協會，」這是　不受軍部的干涉也不受黨部支配的組織，並且賦有從政府的宣傳部，外交機關及秘密警察獲取一切情報的權限。在霍斯好弗指揮之下，千餘經濟學者，心理學者，地理學者，戰略家，歷史家以及其他各種專門人才從事於調查及硏究的工作。</p>
<h3>別矣！美海軍陸戰隊</h3>
<p>— 揚子江</p>
<p>駐華美軍奉令撤退，上海的美國海軍陸戰隊第四聯隊亦遽賦驪歌。『再會吧！上海。』將來美軍重來新中國的時候，一定是被邀為佳賓而受到熱烈的歡迎。今日惜別，我們歡送，歡送第四聯隊上征途。太平洋的風雲越是緊張，波濤越是險惡，征途的責任當然亦是越加重大。別矣！美海軍陸戰隊第四聯隊。</p>
<p>一八五三年（咸豐三年）小刀會之亂，一八六〇年，（咸豐十年）太平天國軍迫滬，美國政府先後派兵駐滬；庚子（光緖二十六年）簽約以後，美國華盛頓陸軍部派遣陸戰隊五百名分駐平津。</p>
<p>美國海軍陸戰隊成立巳經一百六十六年。駐上海的第四聯隊則是在一九一四年四月十六日成立，至今只有二十六年的歷史，起初分駐墨西哥和聖多明果，到一九二七年才舉令調到中國，在那年二月二十四日乘巨型運輸艦抵滬。當時隸屬陸戰隊第三旅，旅部設於天津，一九二九年一月二十九日第三旅奉令解散。美軍各旅官兵除第四聯隊以外，其餘都於翌年二月間返美。第四聯隊乃由兩大隊合併而成。一九三七年滬戰爆發後，美海軍陸戰隊第二旅應公共租界當局之請，於十二月間來滬增防，次年二月十八日第二旅連向第六聯隊及高射砲隊等撤離中國，只剩第四聯隊留駐上海。</p>
<p>美國揚子江艦隊是繼續留駐的，旗艦呂宋號（五七五噸）現泊浦江中段英海軍浮筒，沃湖號（四五〇噸）正游弋長江下游。都都拉號（三七〇噸）則沿重慶江岸。此後將繼續担任保護美僑及產業。</p>
<p>別矣！美國海軍陸戰隊第四聯隊，今日歡送離滬，願他日熱烈歡迎，正是被邀來華觀光新中國之時！</p>
<p>人生</p>
<h3>卐字旗下的勞工</h3>
<p>— 苗勇</p>
<p>中世紀時農奴是地主財產的一部分，農奴被束縛於土地上不得離開，而今日德國工人的情況正和中世紀的農奴類似，所差的是束縛於工作上，而非土地上吧了。</p>
<p>一九三七年有數萬年靑的職員被趕出辦公室，驅到農莊，公路，工塲中去出賣勞力，無數工人這樣地被趕來趕去。沒有政府的允許，工人不得辭職，僱主亦不得歇退工人。但政府有權可以召換任何工人離開他本來的職務，無須僱主的同意，而把他送到別一個地方去做工。</p>
<p>起初納粹强迫巡迴售貨員到田裏和工廠去工作；到了一九三八和三九時就開始　用手藝人，於是有五十萬店家關門，全體職工去參加到所謂勞工階級陣綫中。</p>
<p>德國勞工的生活已全盤軍事化，工資皆為法定，要求提高工資便足以招致嚴懲。長時間的工作亦為法定，不可縮短。假期，入會，休閒皆受納粹的統制。一個工人半途退出，當局有權强迫他回來——正如封建主有權强迫追回一個農奴一樣。</p>
<p>古代的封建主有權殺死農奴。在納粹冶下每個工人有一種勞工護照，上面詳載執照人的訓練，能力，和職業。僱用沒有這種護照的工人是犯法的。所以一個僱主如索回他認為反動的工人的護照，便足以使他餓斃了。</p>
<p>强迫少年工作也是希特勒的一種「德政」。自一九三八年三月起納粹便下令全國各戶人家須把修畢小學兒童的姓名報至負責機關。學校中亦有專人負責把各兒童分配至需要童工的地方去。其中多數的兒童僅只十四歲。在私有的農奴制下，僅是農奴生育農奴吧了；而在納粹　下每個婦女皆是奴隸的生產者。</p>
<p>在這種非人道的統制下，過着暗無天日的勞工有二千多萬呢。但是誰敢斷定，他們永遠不會怒吼起來呢？</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十四　打英雄的生活</p>
<p>「不妨事的，過幾天就會慢慢的好了！」秋海棠總是這樣回答。「你聽，砲聲一天比一天的響了，人家從那邊逃出來的速飯也沒有吃，咱們倒還想吃藥？梅寳，咳嗽是小病，你不用給我操心！」</p>
<p>在中國，一般沒有醫學常識的人總是把咳嗽認做流行性感冒的，直到咳的時間太長久了，病人的精神一天一天的萎頓下去，大家才說「這是癆病；」起初的時候，簡直沒有人注意。</p>
<p>現在，秋海棠也就犯了這個毛病，他雖然覺得咳嗽的時候非常吃力，而且體溫似乎比平常高一些，都是以前因受感冒而咳嗽的時候所沒有的症象；但為了生活的壓迫，和經濟的困難，使他實在不敢貿貿然的踏進醫生家的大鬥去。</p>
<p>幾天來，他總在嘴裏銜着一塊冰糖，因為唯有這個方法，可以使他咳嗆得好一些。</p>
<p>這天傍晚，他向張銀財吿假沒有邀准以後，便勉强曳着疲倦的身子，沿着長浜路，一步一步的走回去；快要走到一個轉角上的時候，突然迎面來了兩個人，一路扭打，一路追逐，誰也沒有留神到他，待他自己想避讓已經來不及了。」（二六九）</p>

<p>游藝界</p>
<h3>談「孔夫子」的命運</h3>
<p>— 周錦濤</p>
<p>在上海曇花一現的「孔夫子」，現已決定耍重映了。孔夫子的編導者是費穆先生。費先生的編導成績，是有相當信譽的。依照孔夫子特刊上的說明，知道編導和攝製是費了很大的心力。照理費了偌大精力攝製而父經過特別宣傳的片子，而且片中材料及主要人物，是中外皆知的中國至聖先師孔老夫子，應該是賣座特盛，到處歡迎了，但是出於意料的事情，常常會在上海出現。它在金城映不到多久，就宣吿換片了。而且要經過將近一年的光陰，才在上海重映。孔夫子生前作魯相不過三月，就被迫離開山東，幾千年後，攝製成影片，不到半月又見摒於上海，難道他的命運註定如此嗎？寫到這里，不禁替至聖先師扼腕！</p>
<p>考孔夫子的不能叫座，原因是：缺少聯絡，但這不能全怪編劇者的手段，只因孔子的一生，就是朝東暮西，缺少安定，他在外是多久，周遊列國，有的竟住不上一星期，就已征車前進了。還有一個原因是攝製時全用論語等書上的文言句子，猜度編導者的苦心，大概是恐防改譯了國語，容易失去本意和語氣。這未免忽略了觀衆的文藝修養。補救的辦法，在片子上加印詞句，像西片上加印華文一樣，使看的人如果聽得不淸楚，可以再看添印上去的詞句。平心而論，這片子是値得一看的。尤其是在黑白不分，是非混淆，正氣消沉的此時此地，最可憐的是上海的觀衆，有的太幼稚了，他們或她們，不但看不懂國產的文藝片，就是文藝性或傳記性的西片，又何嘗感到興趣？</p>
<p>記得有一次上海開映一張萬世師表時，一般較有學問的人看得感動得甚至流淚，認為有價値，有意義，但是有大部份的「士」「女」，却看得莫明其妙，賣座不盛，映期天然縮短了。老實不客氣的說一句，到頭輪影院去看西片的「士」「女」能完全聽得懂英語的，恐怕不過十之三四罷。十之五六，只是湊熱鬧，跑去坐上二小時，等一回兒出來，在交際塲中，驕傲似的說是某某片我也看過了。我的意思，製片商及影院，有時不能全以金錢為前提，須兼負一些敎育大衆，敎育觀客的義務，一個製片廠，每隔二年，至少攝製一部比較深奧的有敎育意義的片子；一家電影院每年至少要映　二張賣座不十分好而有敎育觀衆價値的片子。這樣漸漸的可以把觀衆的眼光提高，達到娛樂不忘敎育的最大目的。</p>
<p>還有中宣部碰到這種片子，應當予以獎勵，物質的，榮饗的一切都好。我相信這部「孔夫子」如果能得中宣部的獎勵，一窩蜂的上海觀衆，就是上次認為不曾滿意的，也會用另一副眼「鏡」，去重新觀看次的。</p>
<h3>梅蘭芳　將車上紅氍毹</h3>
<p>據可靠方面消息：梅蘭芳寄跡香島，數年於茲，其夫人福芝芳女士今夏始歸寓滬上，梅氏前以重慶昆明貴陽等地紳商，為振濟寒季災黎起見，特發起演唱義務戲，曾數度電邀，請其遄往西南諸地出演，刻聞梅氏巳有允意，將準備一切，應約獻演，姑誌之待證。</p>
<h3>評阿Q正傳</h3>
<p>— 金格</p>
<p>阿Q，這一個代表着封建農村中的無知無識的典型人物，雖經魯迅先生加以深刻的刻劃，大聲吶喊，一面可憐阿Q無知覺地犧牲，一面希望每一個人意識裏面的阿Q死去！</p>
<p>阿Q死去許多年了，連阿Q的刻劃者魯迅先生也巳逝世五年，然而，阿Q的影子，阿Q的心理，還是打從每一個社會階層間傳播着，封建的專制的制度並不根本燬滅，甚至若干地方，益見根深蒂固了，——多少阿Q一樣的人，無知無覺，無形地被犧牲了，被吞食了。為此，「阿Q正傳」的重演，在今日，尤具至深的意義。</p>
<p>這次重演，第五幕是與原作陳瑜改編者不同，但，全劇就也以這不同的第五幕最有力，錢大少爺趙老太爺兩人玩弄着手段，輕易殺了阿Q，藉口正又是那麽的詭滑，同時，非但暴露錢大少爺卑鄙的念頭，又襯出趙老太爺自私的打算，對於道一羣人的嘴臉，簡直再深刻也沒有的加以抨擊了。</p>
<p>此外，裝置與道具燈光各方面，在這次重演時，也都有新的技巧的運用，最後一幕羣衆塲面，導演者處理得活潑又生動，阿Q將遊街前手舞足蹈。突發現自己的手銬尙未解開時，道一節，很有控制觀衆情緖感動的力量。</p>

<h3>血雨瓊葩</h3>
<p>— 頋明道</p>
<p>第十九章　黃昏胡騎塵滿城</p>
<p>李闖見劉宗敏等戰明將不下，自己方面又折去樊大麻子，不免暗暗吃驚。想吳三桂的部下，怎樣都是驍勇之輩。牛全醒在旁對李自成說道：「大王你看三桂部下能人不少，今日若和他鬭將，我們未免吃虧。好在我們兵多，請大王下令全軍出戰，向前衝鋒，和他們混戰一陣，我們兵多，自然他們抵禦不住了」李自成也贊成此說，便又令軍中擂起前進鼓聲，衆流寇一齊向前，馬奔卒馳，漫山遍野，分作數大隊，向三桂陣上衝殺而來。一霎時張蒼虬許靖等巳被流寇包圍在垓心。三桂也揮衆迎敵，兩邊亂殺一陣。流寇的人數只顧增加，聲勢浩大。淸軍那邊的攝政王多爾袞率領阿濟格，多鐸，洪承疇，孔有德，尙可喜，等都立馬在高崗上觀戰。初見吳三桂麾下的明將連斬數賊，凌厲無前，不覺大為驚異。後見流寇挾着家多之勢，張開兩翼，包圍明軍，如潮湧一般。明軍人人血戰，衝盪格鬭，喊殺之聲，震動海嶠。時已近午，塵沙山起，怒若雷嗚，雙方死傷甚衆，屍如山積。多爾袞回顧多鐸道：「這時候我們可以出而破賊了」。令索倫部的騎兵當先衝鋒。索倫部的衆健兒是滿洲諸部中最為驍勇的部隊，素善馳騁，尤擅火槍弓弩，淸軍每戰時都敎索倫部任攻陷之責的，可稱精銳。當時鼓聲大震，淸軍從三桂陣右突出，萬馬奔騰，飛矢如雨，火槍砰訇，聲如雷霆，所向之處，無不辟易。</p>

<h3>U.S. Conditions for Peace with Japan: Abandon Axis, Cease Aggression; Japan Presents Counterproposal Including Two Demands; Tokyo Reply Expected, Negotiations to Continue</h3>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 21st—Although yesterday was Thanksgiving, Secretary of State Hull still met with Ambassador Nomura and Special Envoy Kurusu. The United States firmly reiterated its previous stance on a possible settlement with Japan. A reliable source stated after the meeting that the United States "has not retreated one inch" in its insistence on the "New Deal" in the Far East. After the envoys left, Hull met with Hamilton, the Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Bureau of the State Department.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 20th—Japanese Special Envoy Kurusu and Ambassador Nomura met again yesterday with Secretary of State Hull. It was expected that they would telegraph Tokyo for instructions after speaking with the President and Secretary of State earlier in the week. Now, new instructions have been received, so talks continue. This meeting lasted one hour. Kurusu told reporters in a facetious tone, "We are now making a Thanksgiving visit." Nomura said that talks are continuing, and whether or not they will meet with Hull on Friday will be determined after studying the current information.</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 21st—Secretary of State Hull met with Ambassador Nomura and Special Envoy Kurusu yesterday. The United States insisted on its position that Japan should sever its ties with the Axis powers and end its aggression in China and Vietnam. It is believed that Hull reiterated to the two Japanese envoys that, to achieve a satisfactory result in the current talks, Japan must sever its Axis ties and end its aggressive policies. It is understood that the two Japanese politicians carried new instructions from Tokyo when they visited Hull. Japan's attitude remains inscrutable, but the matter is now seen as hopeful. Informed sources say that the meeting participants frankly pointed out the outlines of their conditions. The main points of Japan's demands are summarized as follows: The ABCD (America, Britain, China, Dutch) line must be relaxed, and the United States must reduce its aid to China. The United States must remove political pressure regarding Japan's program to build a "New Order" in East Asia. On the other hand, Japan expressed its willingness to accept the following points: Willing not to have direct cooperation with Germany. Willing to stop military threats to the Dutch East Indies and Siberia. Willing to end the war in China as soon as possible. Informed sources say that the United States requires Japan to implement the following points: Sever alliance with the Axis powers. Withdraw troops from China. Stop all aggression. Agree to the same economic opportunities in the Asian market for all other countries.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 21st—The Times correspondent in Washington reported that Secretary of State Hull, in a long talk with Japanese Ambassador Nomura and Special Envoy Kurusu, firmly stated that the United States could not be satisfied with any agreement that merely acknowledged the current situation in the East. However, the United States is prepared to consider a program of action, jointly participated in by countries in western Asia and the Pacific region, which could serve as the basis for a final settlement. This statement is considered quite accurate, but has not yet been confirmed by authorities. The correspondent also stated that indispensable factors towards a final settlement will include: Japan's withdrawal from the Axis, withdrawal from China, withdrawal from Vietnam (regarding points involving the Vichy status), abandonment of continued aggression, and adoption of an equal policy in commercial opportunities. A key point is missing from this unconfirmed news: unless the United States expresses its willingness to assume clear responsibility for handling all matters when these conditions are accepted, Japan cannot be expected to accept them. Hull may have realized the possibility of proceeding along this path, but the extent to which he has done so has not been indicated.</p>
<p>United Press International, Tokyo, 20th—The Emperor of Japan met with Foreign Minister Tōgō today. Although Tokyo sources did not specify the reason for the meeting, it is believed to be the Foreign Minister reporting on matters under his jurisdiction. Regarding this, sources in Washington said that Nomura and Kurusu's talks with Hull will resume on Friday. The Japanese representatives have reported the progress of the negotiations to Tokyo and are awaiting their government's response.</p>
<p>Free Trade Is What Is Sought; Tokyo Newspaper Says It Suits the U.S.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 21st—The "Japan Times and Mail," which usually reflects the views of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated today that what Japan wants is free trade, not territory. The article stated that the United States should now be able to see that the current Japanese government emphasizes free trade and access to various resources. Japan has no plans to occupy territory. Japan has previously stated this. Japan wants all countries in the Pacific to engage in full and sincere cooperation to increase trade and exchange of resources and manufactured goods. If the United States proposes a policy of facilitating trade and opening the doors to resources, it should be able to accept Japan's program of cooperation in the Western Pacific. The main point at present is that the United States and Japan reach a tacit understanding regarding the two co-prosperity spheres, one in the Atlantic and one in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Tōgō Declares Negotiations with U.S. Based on Three Principles</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 21st—Foreign Minister Tōgō declared that the three major demands recently made by Prime Minister Tōjō in his address to the Diet are the basic principles for Special Envoy Kurusu to conduct the U.S.-Japan talks. In answering a question from a member of the Budget Committee, the Foreign Minister said that Kurusu's trip to Washington was to expedite the U.S.-Japan talks already begun by Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Nomura. The Japanese government had decided on the negotiations before sending Kurusu to the U.S. The talks had already been in progress since the beginning of this month. Kurusu did not carry any special instructions. In short, the U.S.-Japan negotiations are entirely based on the three demands announced by Prime Minister Tōjō.</p>
<p>Australia and the Netherlands Guarantee Joint Action Against Japan, Willing to Offer Bases for U.S. Use</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 21st—The International News Service correspondent learned yesterday from the highest authority that Australia and the Dutch East Indies have both assured the United States that if Japan starts a war against the U.S. in the Pacific, Australia and the Netherlands will also fight against Japan. The doubts about what the positions of Australia and the Dutch East Indies would be if war broke out in the Pacific have been swept away by the above assurances. Only Thailand's attitude remains undecided, as Thailand is currently maintaining strict neutrality. British Prime Minister Churchill has guaranteed that Britain will declare war on Japan within an hour of the U.S.-Japan war breaking out. The Prime Minister's statement has been fully supported by British territories. Australia's assurance also has the nature of formal support. According to what the correspondent learned, if war breaks out, both Australia and the Dutch East Indies are willing to immediately make their naval, land, and air force bases available for use by the United States to increase the strategic locations for the U.S. in the Pacific. It is also understood that China has also supplied all its bases to the United States. Therefore, the ABCD countries have completed their united front in the Pacific region.</p>
<h3>Another New U.S. Battleship Launched Yesterday</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 21st—The battleship "Indiana," with a displacement of 35,000 tons and costing approximately $70 million, is scheduled to be launched today, six months ahead of schedule. The ship is equipped with three turrets, each housing three 16-inch guns, and has a speed of over 27 knots per hour.</p>
<p>Reuters, Newport News, Virginia, 21st—U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox gave a speech at the launching ceremony of the new battleship Indiana, saying that this giant ship is a symbol of the nation's desire to survive in the global war. We all know where our hopes and attention are placed in this war and have announced our determination that our side will win this world-shaking war.</p>
<h3>Japan Promotes Southern Advance Policy, Thailand Feels Threatened; Thai Aircraft Patrolling Border Shot At, Thai Government Protests to Japan</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th—The Times diplomatic correspondent stated that although talks in Washington are underway, Japan is still hoping to make progress in the southwest Pacific. Japan has not only stationed troops on the Vietnamese border close to the Burma Road, but has also demonstrated with warships off the coast of Thailand. According to recent evidence, Japan is now using the long-delayed negotiations to demarcate the Vietnamese-Thai border as a tool to seek extremely important concessions. When Vietnam ceded land to Thailand in March of this year, the final border demarcation was left for another day. Today, Vietnamese planes seem to have been given the right to fly over the border to take maps. Japanese authorities now also want to use the airfields in eastern Thailand and Bangkok and want Thai authorities to provide gasoline. Such concessions are obviously extremely dangerous, as the Japanese can thereby gain many footholds and develop rapidly. Thai authorities are now deeply aware of this danger and are making arrangements accordingly.</p>
<p>United Press International, Bangkok, 21st—Reliable sources here say that two Thai aircraft were damaged on the Vietnamese border this week, and one Thai person died. Thailand has lodged an informal protest with Japanese authorities in Vietnam regarding these two incidents. Reliable sources claimed that the French anti-aircraft artillery team of Vien-San-Tan-La fired on Thai aircraft scouting over Thai territory, damaging two Thai aircraft. Newspapers here reported that an aircraft of unknown nationality flew over the Thai city of Tran-Ya for five minutes at midnight on November 17, then flew towards Vietnam. Newspapers also reported that two French aircraft recently flew over Thailand's Nong-Kai province for ten minutes, then flew towards Vien-San-Tan-La. The Thai side did not fire on the intruders in either case. Well-informed sources pointed out that in each incident involving the French side, Thai newspapers did not mention Japan, but the protests were lodged with the Japanese authorities in Vietnam. Thai newspapers also reported today that ten Vietnamese soldiers crossed the border on November 18 and attacked a Thai village near Nong-Kai. The villagers resisted. One villager was abducted and killed by the Vietnamese soldiers. Officials declined to comment on the incident, but said they did not consider it to be of any importance. At the same time, the Propaganda Bureau denied foreign reports that Japanese troops were concentrated on the Vietnamese border and that Japanese warships were stationed in Saigon as a threat to Thailand. The official announcement stated that the Thai Prime Minister had consulted with the Japanese Ambassador to Thailand for an hour today.</p>
<h3>Evacuation of Japanese Nationals Overseas</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 11th—Two NYK Line ships arrived in Kobe this morning, carrying a total of 1,500 Japanese nationals evacuated from the Philippines, Burma, Africa, and the Near East, including the Japanese Consul in Calcutta, the Japanese Consul in Beirut, the First Secretary of the Japanese Legation in Cairo, and representatives of various Japanese trading companies overseas.</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of Australian Troops Arrive in Singapore; Cooper Visits New Zealand</h3>
<p>United Press International, Singapore, 20th—Officials announced that a large number of Australian troops arrived in Singapore today for defense. Many of the newly arrived troops are technicians to strengthen the Royal Air Force and ground armored units.</p>
<p>Reuters, Auckland, New Zealand, 21st—British Cabinet Representative Mr. and Mrs. Duff Cooper have arrived here from Sydney, Australia.</p>
<h3>Iraq Announces Severance of Relations with France</h3>
<p>United Press International, Vichy, 21st—France's pre-war position in the Near East ended yesterday when the government formally announced that Iraq and France had severed diplomatic relations. Iraqi Minister Bo-Que-Chi went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday morning to inform them of Iraq's decision to sever relations. Experts here believe that this move was caused by British pressure on Iraq. Under the old oil agreement, France could obtain 24 percent of Iraq's oil, which flowed through Iraq, past British and French storage tank officials, to the Syrian border and then into France. Severing diplomatic relations obviously deprives France of the right to obtain oil.</p>

<h3>Tense Situation on Yunnan-Vietnam Border, Elite Chinese Troops Stand Ready; Strong Forces Determined to Deter Japanese Invasion; Chongqing Circles Enthusiastic About Eden's Declaration</h3>
<p>Guilin - The situation on the Yunnan-Vietnam border remains tense, with Chinese and Japanese troops facing off across the border. Both sides' troops are elite. It is estimated that there are a total of 80,000 Japanese troops currently concentrated in Vietnam, of which 50,000 are stationed in Tokyo and 30,000 are assembled in southern Vietnam. It is reported that among the Japanese troops stationed in Vietnam, there are the Konoe Division and the 18th and 3rd Divisions recently transferred from Guangzhou. Elite Chinese troops, including mechanized units, are now deploying along the border to deal with possible Japanese attacks. Chinese military authorities believe that if fighting along the border breaks out, it will be the fiercest battle in the Sino-Japanese War to date, as both sides will commit their most elite troops and latest equipment to the battle. Currently, the Japanese have 100 aircraft stationed in Vietnam and 80 Japanese warships near Cam Ranh Bay. Large quantities of Japanese military supplies were transported there during the week of November 1st to 8th, including 70 field guns. The Chinese side believes that before attacking Yunnan, the Japanese may launch offensives in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces to try to divert Chinese attention as much as possible, as evidenced by recent Japanese military activity in the Guangzhou area. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>London - Chinese Ambassador to the UK Gu Weijun gave a speech at the London National Trades Union Club last night, saying that the Chinese army is now stronger than at the beginning of the war after four and a half years of fighting. China, like the Soviet Union, is resisting the Axis advance eastward and is now containing the Japanese advance westward. The Chinese army today has five million soldiers, and another ten million reserves have been trained. China has gradually taken the initiative in the war over the past three years. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Various circles in Chongqing are extremely pleased with British Foreign Secretary Eden's remarks in the House of Commons regarding a Japanese attack on the Yunnan-Burma Road. Chinese observers often believe that Japan will not advance north or south for fear of war with Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and is most likely to attack the Yunnan-Burma Road. Britain and the United States have repeatedly announced that if Japan advances north or south, they are prepared to take active countermeasures, but have not made clear their attitude regarding the possibility of a Japanese attack on the Yunnan-Burma Road. The road is now China's most important supply line and is closely related to China's war effort, so the Chinese are very concerned. Eden's declaration has greatly reassured various circles in China, as they know that if the Japanese attack the road, Britain and the United States will not let China fight alone. The remarks made by Senator Pepper, Chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, advocating Japanese withdrawal from China, are also welcomed by Chinese political circles.

<p>Chongqing - Well-informed Chinese sources said today that the Japanese navy recently built a night-flying base overnight on Huizhou Island (transliteration), which can accommodate 200 large bombers. Last week, the Japanese conducted night-flying exercises there. (United Press International, 21st)</p>
<p>Chongqing - A military spokesman reported at a press conference today that there had been no significant fighting on any front in the past week. Preparations for the Japanese to open a new battlefield in Vietnam are still underway. There are currently slightly less than 20,000 Japanese troops on the Yunnan-Vietnam border and 100,000 in southern Vietnam and on the Thai-Vietnam border. This number is consistent with the government spokesman's statement last Monday that there were 120,000 Japanese troops in Vietnam. However, the spokesman did not comment on the direction of their movements. Regarding Japan's amendment to the conscription law, the spokesman said that according to the new method, even those who were originally unfit and students in school would be enlisted, which would yield about 400,000 people. In addition, Japan also decided to conscript 260,000 Koreans, which not only expands the number of standing troops, but also serves as a demonstration to the ABCD group. (Havas Agency, 20th)</p>

<p>Chongqing - The Standing Committee of the previous session of the National Political Council made a detailed review of the implementation of the resolutions of the previous General Assembly and reported it to the General Assembly. It is learned that the content of the report is that the government has basically implemented the various proposals of the previous General Assembly and has achieved considerable results. However, there are still some aspects that have not been thoroughly implemented, so it specifically lists the facts, hoping that the government will consult and implement them. The main points are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding military affairs, it is believed that the government has indeed strengthened its military offensive capabilities, and the combat strategy has been successful. However, the direct delivery of rations to the military has not been completely eliminated. It is hoped that the government will earnestly implement the military food management implementation measures to improve this.</p>
<p>Regarding diplomacy, the government has been able to strive for an active position in diplomacy in the past eight months, promoting the close union of the anti-aggression front of China, Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and the Soviet Union. It is hoped that it will continue to work hard to improve the overall international position. Also, the development of the economy of the Overseas Chinese is extremely important. It is hoped that the government will allocate funds to actively handle it.</p>
<p>Regarding financial and economic matters, it is believed that the government has made progress in handling finance, economy, transportation, and food during this extraordinary period. However, there are still some things that do not seem to be entirely satisfactory. First, stabilizing commodity prices. Commodity prices have remained high in recent years, and it can be seen that the work of stabilizing prices still requires greater effort, and must be dealt with strictly in accordance with the recommendations of previous General Assemblies with a firm determination and resolute means in order to stabilize people's lives. Second, highway transportation is of great importance to the rear transportation and commodity prices. The government has repeatedly reorganized the transportation agencies, but the means of transportation have not yet been improved. It is hoped that the government will pay close attention to ensuring that rear transportation is secure and that commodity prices in various places do not fluctuate. Regarding internal affairs and education, it is hoped that the government will publish the implementation dates of the regulations on the organization and election of county councils as soon as possible, and universally establish them within the prescribed time limit to achieve the full effect of local autonomy. The lives of civil servants are quite difficult due to the rise in commodity prices. The current improvement measures for the income of civil servants are still far from keeping pace with the rise in commodity prices. It is hoped that the government will consider the actual situation and adjust it in a timely and effective manner. Other matters such as the improvement of secondary education, the development of culture in border areas, the adjustment of industrial education, and the promotion of national defense science are all of great importance to the future of national education and it is hoped that the government will consult and implement them as soon as possible.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Farewell, Collins</h3>
<p>Farewell, Collins. The Fourth Marine Regiment, established for 25 years, with more than half of those years stationed in China, is not a short time. Your arrival was to protect overseas Chinese, but unexpectedly, in the last five years, you became the pillar of Shanghai's security. Maintaining the neutrality of Shanghai's international market, preserving this piece of safe land, and being the host for merchants and travelers from various countries, was indeed due to the joint efforts of the local authorities and the troops of various countries. However, Collins' assistance often proved effective in intangible ways, maneuvering in the depths of unpredictability, pulling back from the brink, turning danger into safety, so that although the people of Shanghai were shocked and worried about the brink of war, they were still safe and sound, and the neighborhoods were peaceful. This contribution to the people should not be overlooked. As the ancients said: "The most soul-stirring is farewell!" Although this may not be said to the brave and benevolent Collins, can we not all feel the same admiration and reluctance to part? Farewell! Collins, the parting song awaits singing, the whip is about to be cracked. Your future responsibilities are more important than guarding Shanghai in peace. Therefore, as you depart, even if we cannot wave our handkerchiefs on the riverbank or send you off at the eastern gate, we cannot but express our regards here.</p>
<p>The stationing of troops in foreign territory is certainly not the way to treat a country as an equal. The presence of foreign troops in China, including Tianjin and Shanghai, was originally the evil result of the incompetence and obtuseness of the rulers forty years ago, who did not recognize the general trend, mistakenly believed in the words of villains, and the ignorance and recklessness of the rebellious people who abused force. This is certainly not the fault of the entire Chinese population. However, the way various countries punished China was to create the evil precedent of stationing troops and using force as a backing. The way they shackled China was that even after the National Revolutionary Army reached Shanghai, they still colluded to plot against us, leading to the current situation. Who knows if it was not due to a momentary mistake at that time, providing wings to a tiger? Today's China, although its military strength is still lacking and it must compromise to achieve its goals, the people are not the same as they were forty years ago, and the government is not the same as it was forty years ago. The efforts of fifty years of education have gradually yielded results. The righteous act of American culture, returning the Boxer Indemnity to fund students, has also contributed significantly. Therefore, the successive withdrawal of troops from China by Britain and the United States has its strategic implications. Abandoning the rights under unequal treaties and treating us as equals is consistent. China's founding father said: "I am willing to fight together with nations that treat me as equals." Now, Collins' voluntary withdrawal heralds that the day of implementation is not far off, and China's territory will never allow foreign troops to be stationed again. This action will be the beginning.</p>
<p>Well said, Colonel Howard, commander of the Collins! He said: "The US government has already declared its intention to abandon extraterritorial rights in China when peace is restored. Therefore, the US Marines may not return to China." Regarding this statement, although we have an overwhelming feeling of reluctance at Collins' departure from Shanghai in terms of friendship, we cannot help but express our warm sympathy in terms of public duty. As for the statement that "unless the Chinese government feels unable to protect American interests when normality is restored and requests the United States to send troops, the US military will return to China to assume defense duties," it shows Colonel Howard's vision and careful consideration. From China's standpoint, after normality is restored, it should strive to protect the interests of friendly countries like the United States as much as possible and should not want to disappoint them. However, during the period when normality is about to be restored but has not yet been restored, there may be concerns that the United States' interests are beyond reach, and it is not known whether Collins will be expected to rely on its convenience to return to China to protect them temporarily. Otherwise, standing shoulder to shoulder, taking advantage of the situation, going with the flow, and meeting the people of Shanghai in Shanghai will bring joy and excitement that cannot be described in words. Even better, if Collins passes through Shanghai on its way during military movements, it will be a pleasure to reminisce about old times, a boundless joy. Collins' departure carries the supreme feelings of the people of Shanghai. Returning home to tell his countrymen and comrades that in the eyes of the Chinese people, they do not find the American military hateful, but rather feel that they are adorable. This is because the American government and people share sympathy for China, and it has made it so, not just sympathy, but also something that will be seen in reality. The greatest achievement of reality is "the right of mankind to live in freedom and equality." The US military is a symbol of American authority, and therefore, the people of Shanghai cannot but express their deep expectations as they depart. However, the people of Shanghai are also worried by Collins' departure, which shows that the people of Shanghai rely on Collins as a Great Wall, and their trust is no less than that of their own army. Although, if they want to destroy Shanghai, then so be it. Otherwise, if there is an incident, leaving an "international relay station" in the Far East, there is no more suitable place than Shanghai, which is rich in internationality. Moreover, the authorities of the concession have repeatedly encountered accidents, but they have the strength to stay out of the vortex of the incident, and their spirit of maintaining security with painstaking efforts is also well known to the people of Shanghai. Therefore, all future measures will certainly live up to this meaning and will never allow the Shanghai concession to have any possibility of changing its original state for a time. Moreover, the war will eventually have a day of reckoning. Since the concession has no military action, it is only a market for industry and commerce. If it wants to wreak havoc and monopolize it, the consequences will also be reckoned with the reckoning of the war. Moreover, the status of the concession will be reformed after the war and has become a temporary situation at present. Why must it be so eager to dominate for a time and forget the possibility of meeting again in the future? People are not stupid and should not do this. Even if Shanghai becomes more and more panicked in the future due to the war atmosphere, this is what is called the deeper the darkness, the closer the light. The people of Shanghai can only endure and wait for the arrival of light! Therefore, although Collins has left, Collins' spirit of maintaining Shanghai's security will last forever.</p>
<p>Farewell, Collins! The people of Shanghai have nothing to repay, except to wish you a bright future and boundless happiness! And also sincerely pray that there will be an end to this chaotic and tumultuous situation, to eliminate the violence of sin and slavery, and to establish lasting freedom, fraternity, and justice. I offer this as a parting message, which I think Collins will be happy to sympathize with.</p>
<h3>Huge Military Expenditure Passed, Japanese Parliament Closed Yesterday, Tojo Said Japan Faces Critical Moment of Survival, Completion of Preparations Sufficient to Cope with Incidents</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 21st: The special session of the parliament, which lasted for five days, held a brief closing ceremony at 11:00 this morning. At that time, Prime Minister Tojo read the edict issued by the Emperor to the members of both houses. Then Tojo entered the palace to report to the Emperor on political and administrative matters. A banquet was held at the Prime Minister's official residence at noon to entertain government representatives and members of parliament.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 21st: Japanese Prime Minister Tojo reiterated yesterday that Japan is facing the greatest difficulty in its history and is at a crossroads of destruction. The preparation expenses requested by the government are necessary to cope with any future incident. Viscount Okouchi asked whether it was appropriate to transfer the railway revenue to war expenses when railway accidents occur frequently. Finance Minister Kaya replied that railway improvement was indeed necessary, but the war was even more urgent. The provisional meeting of the parliament completed its work on its agenda last night with a record of unanimous support for any plan decided by the government. The unprecedented huge war expenses, the great increase in indirect taxes, the expansion of the scope of application of the conscription law, and the order to inspect foreigners' mail were all quickly passed to show national unity. The only noteworthy criticism from the members of parliament was Shimada's criticism of the United States.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 21st: Finance Minister Kaya told the House of Peers yesterday that Japan's assets frozen by the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands amounted to 900,000,000 Japanese yen, while Japan's assets frozen by the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands were only 400,000,000 yen. However, the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands held many Japanese bonds, so this number increased to 1,800,000,000 yen. The work of the provisional parliament has been completed, and a closing ceremony will be held today. The government's plan to increase funding for war agencies has been passed in more than thirteen cases, including a 3,800,000,000 yen extraordinary military budget and a 515,000,000 yen supplementary budget.</p>
<h3>Soviet Official Refutes Japanese Rumors, Denies Border Crossing in Manchuria</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 21st: The Japanese Domei News Agency claimed that on November 16, Soviet troops invaded the Manchurian border and clashed 40 kilometers north of Manzhouli. As a result, one Soviet soldier was killed and two others were captured. TASS has recently been officially authorized to declare that this report is completely untrue. No Soviet soldiers crossed the border.</p>
<h3>Summary of Administrative Reports from the National参政会</h3>
<p>Main Points of the Report</p>
<p>For the first three days of the Chongqing National Senate, in addition to the content of the education and agriculture and forestry reports, the following other items can also be mentioned.</p>
<p>(1) Military: Minister He Yingqin first explained the military strategy, and then gave a detailed description of the reorganization of the army, the replenishment of soldiers, the supply of military materials, and the management of wounded soldiers. The troops that have been reorganized and trained according to the new system account for two-thirds of the total number in the country. The production of military materials has been much smoother than before due to the US supplies.</p>
<p>(2) Diplomacy: Minister Guo Taiqi's narrative focused on strengthening ties and cooperation with democratic countries, and explained the guarantees of the United Kingdom and the United States to abolish unequal treaties, the establishment of the Equalization Fund, the visit of the British financial and economic delegation and the US military delegation to China, and the role of the US Lend-Lease Act for China, and the role of sealing Chinese funds.</p>
<p>(3) Financial report: The content is divided into three parts: taxation, finance, and trade. According to the report, the direct tax system is gradually expanding. The central government has taken over the field tax and implemented the levy in kind smoothly. The design of six daily necessities monopoly has been completed and is now being planned for implementation. As for government expenditures, they are not as large as generally expected, which is also related to the US Lend-Lease Act.</p>
<p>(4) Transportation: Minister Zhang Jiaao said that the highways have been transferred to the Transportation Control Bureau for military convenience. Although the postal transportation is a new initiative, the transportation volume is considerable, and it provides many subsidies to places where waterways and railways are not accessible. Regarding the railway part, Zhang said that although under very difficult circumstances, nine new roads have been built. The Yunnan-Burma Railway, which is most concerned by all parties, is being built quickly due to the subsidy of the Lend-Lease Act.</p>
<p>(5) Economy: Minister Weng Wenhao described the development of state-owned enterprises, listing the production figures of electricity, fuel, metallurgy, machinery, electrical materials, and chemical industries. Although not huge, all senators were deeply excited. Regarding private enterprises, the government has lent huge amounts of funds, but private floating funds are still destroying exchange rates and prices. Weng admitted that he did not handle it satisfactorily. The manufacturing industry in the rear is now affected by prices, and profits have decreased compared with before. If export goods and minerals cannot maintain lower costs, they may lose the international market.</p>
<p>(6) Society: This department is newly established, and the departments are too trivial to be mentioned. Only in terms of cooperatives, according to the report, there are already more than 156,000 units nationwide, with more than 8 million members.</p>
<p>(7) Internal affairs: The most important is the new county system. It was implemented in the provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hubei, Fujian, Zhejiang, Gansu, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Qinghai, and Ning last year, and in the provinces of Hunan, Guizhou, Kang, Lu, and Anhui this year.</p>
<p>(8) Grain: This is also a newly established department, but it is the opposite of the Ministry of Social Affairs. The degree of attention it receives is no less than that of financial prices, so there are also the most and most intense questions. The process has been seen in the previous telegram and will not be described in detail here. In summary, Minister Xu Kan was optimistic in the report and very humble when questioned. One point mentioned in the report is that the department has done its part in the military preparations on the Yunnan border, because the grain in Yunnan Province is not abundant.

<h3>Close Cooperation Between Britain and the Soviet Union to Achieve Combat Goals, Eden and Maisky Make Speeches, No Conflicts of Interest Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 21st: Today, Soviet Ambassador Maisky and British Foreign Secretary Eden both made speeches at a luncheon of the British-Soviet People's Relations Committee, vigorously stating the close friendly cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Embassy, ​​the Soviet government, will be willing to cooperate as closely as possible with Britain based on its pre-war policies. Although there are some difficulties in this matter, it can be completed with the sincerity of both parties. The spirit of friendly cooperation between Britain, the Soviet Union, and its allies, supplemented by the growing resistance of residents in the Nazi-occupied areas, and with the friendly assistance of the United States, will surely defeat the enemy and achieve a common victory. Hitler's blitzkrieg strategy on the Eastern Front has completely failed, and now the severe winter has arrived, and the German army</p>
<h3>"Sea Eagle" Painting Given to Churchill</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Famous Chinese painter Zhang Jun painted a sea eagle, inscribed with a poem written by the late famous poet Yang Yunshi fifteen days before his death. It will soon be sent to London in the name of the Chinese people and given to Churchill. The Hundred Doves painting given to President Roosevelt in January of this month was also painted by Mr. Zhang. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3>Alumni of Peking University in Chongqing Plan to Build a Cai Yuanpei Memorial Hall</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Peking University alumni in Chongqing gathered for a dinner yesterday to discuss the construction of a memorial hall for Mr. Cai Yuanpei. As a result, it was decided that one party would raise funds for the design, and the other party would open a memorial hall in the Central Library to display Cai's relics, calligraphy, and objects. (Havas News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>The difficulties encountered will be far greater than those of the defenders. The Soviet army will use this opportunity to carry out military operations in the winter. Hitler once said that he would carry out a war of annihilation against us, but he did not know that he would soon suffer. Germany can only be defeated in the end on land, and every allied country must contribute to achieve this goal. British Foreign Secretary Eden said that in international politics, there is no reason for any conflict of interest between Britain and the Soviet Union. The British people are willing to cooperate most closely with the Soviet Union at this time and after the war. Recalling his visit to Moscow in 1935 to meet with Stalin and Litvinov, the two sides issued a joint communique afterward, vigorously stating that the two governments had no conflict of interest on any issue of international policy. This fact is the solid foundation for the development of effective cooperation between the two parties on the path to peace. The British government and people sincerely wish that the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union should be placed on the basis of permanent cooperation. Since the two countries agreed to take joint action in July, many other events have strengthened this unity. In this struggle, there is only one path to follow, mutual assistance is self-help, our resources are Soviet resources, and Soviet resources are also our resources. The ships carrying ammunition, bullets, and tanks to the Soviet Union return loaded with precious raw materials to supply Britain's war effort. At a time when the Soviet army is trying to stop the Germans and counterattack, the British army can launch an offensive in Libya, which is very satisfactory to the British people everywhere. He meant that Britain and the Soviet Union's interests are mutually beneficial in a certain range and there is no opposition. Eden said at the end that the only purpose of all free countries is to eliminate German military power and replace it with world peace and order.</p>

<h3>British Forces in North Africa Launch Sharp Offensive, Penetrating 100 Miles into Libya, Occupying Rezegh and Approaching Sidi Rezegh, Major Joint Operation by Land, Sea, and Air Begins</h3>
<p>Cairo, 21st (Associated Press) – Motorized rapid-advance units of the British Imperial Army yesterday penetrated 100 miles into Libya, occupying Rezegh, ten miles southeast of Tobruk. The largest war in African history has now almost entirely begun. With naval and air support, the Imperial forces are conducting sharp offensives from Egypt against the Axis forces concentrated at Sidi Rezegh, while also bombing Axis supply lines in Libya and the Mediterranean. The aim is to defeat the large German and Italian forces concentrated at Rezegh and advancing towards El Adem. Both locations are about 100 miles from the Egyptian front line. According to official sources, "German tanks at the Capuzzo Battery suddenly retreated before they could be effectively deployed to the front lines. The battle is currently proceeding smoothly. The forces occupying Rezegh appear to have launched their offensive from south of Sollum, then moved northeast, advancing towards Rezegh and Bir el Gubi in the desert. It is possible that these advancing forces have made contact with the garrison at Tobruk. Whether this contact has been established is unknown, but according to official reports, the Axis forces at Tobruk and Sollum seem unable to maintain direct communication. The British plan to encircle and isolate the elite Axis forces, especially the German armored divisions, around Sollum and Halfaya Pass by circumventing Bardia is succeeding. Experts here believe that the battle is now like a race, with German armored divisions retreating westward and powerful British forces rapidly advancing."</p>
<p>Cairo, 21st (Reuters) – The British Army of the Nile, under the command of Lieutenant-General Cunningham, with strong air support, continued its westward advance yesterday, occupying Rezegh, located on a slope ten miles southeast of the Tobruk defense line. According to a General Headquarters communiqué, a British armored car unit, advancing along this road, engaged Italian armored cars in the Gubi area, with considerable success, destroying several enemy tanks and capturing 150 enemy soldiers. Simultaneously, a British tank unit, 30 miles west of Capuzzo, encountered several German tanks, but the enemy vehicles retreated before engagement. While these military operations were underway, British forces continued to pressure the enemy forces making localized stubborn defenses between Halfaya Pass and Sidi Omar. According to the communiqué, the battle is "continuing to develop satisfactorily." The British Air Force, in cooperation with the Army, operated throughout the day, heavily bombing enemy tanks, transport units, and enemy positions, and strafing transport vehicles on the road south of Qalaat al Burdi. Enemy airfields were also attacked. After the Temimi enemy airfield was bombed, seven enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground. The airfields at Rezegh and Acroma were also bombed, destroying three Italian aircraft. Several enemy motor transport vehicles were destroyed by British aircraft strafing. On Tuesday night, British bombers attacked the Tripoli power station and port facilities. At the same time, the docks and railways of Naples and the docks of Brindisi were heavily bombed by British aircraft, causing fires. Three British aircraft were lost.</p>
<p>London, 21st (Reuters) – British Imperial forces, supported by the powerful Royal Air Force, have launched a large-scale encircling offensive in the desert, cutting off the rear of the Axis forces entrenched between Halfaya Pass and Sidi Omar, and have occupied Rezegh, about ten miles southeast of Tobruk. The relief of Tobruk should not be far off.</p>
<p>Churchill Reports on the War Situation: Objective is to Annihilate Axis Forces</p>
<p>London, 21st (Reuters) – Prime Minister Churchill announced to the House of Commons yesterday that British forces had launched an offensive in Libya, stating, "The enemy forces in Libya have been attacked and will be completely surprised. The British Desert Army is now in an advantageous position to test its strength. So far, I do not know whether this test has occurred between armored vehicles, but this test will clearly not be long delayed." The Prime Minister further cautioned against excessive optimism, saying that General Auchinleck and his subordinate General Cunningham, leading the Eighth Army, had made strategic advances and occupied advantageous positions. The future depends on the ensuing battles. "In the next few days, we will see new developments including many features of considerable interest. One thing is certain: the British and Imperial forces have been waiting patiently for a long time and are eager to fight. They will now fight the enemy with great determination and confidence, because we are now entering the battle with at least equally good arms and equipment, and we understand that the victory of the British forces in Libya is crucial to the progress of the entire war." (Applause)</p>
<p>London, 21st (Associated Press) – British Prime Minister Churchill told the jubilant House of Commons yesterday that strong Imperial forces in the Middle East have begun to cross the Egyptian border and enter Cyrenaica to eliminate the Axis armored forces there and relieve their constant threat. Mr. Churchill said, "This offensive has been prepared for a long time and thoroughly. We do not yet know whether the two armies have made a decisive contact, but the time is not far off. The objective of the offensive is not the capture of one or two positions, but the annihilation of the enemy's land forces, especially their armored divisions." At the same time, the War Office released a letter from Mr. Churchill to the Imperial Army and Mediterranean Fleet, stating, "This battle will have a great impact on the entire war situation." The message warned the soldiers, "The time has come for the final great offensive to fight for ultimate victory, home, and freedom." It also said, "This is the first time that British and Imperial forces are competing with the German army on the battlefield with all kinds of strong and modern weapons." A senior British official stated that he believes "this will probably be the decisive battle of this century." Official documents announced that this offensive has been in preparation for five months. During this period, the United States sent a large number of various armaments to the Middle East. The weapons delivered by the United States include tanks. Army officers believe that these American-made tanks are better than those possessed by Germany. Lieutenant-General Sir Cunningham is apparently adopting the successful tactics of General Wavell, using aircraft smoke screens as cover in advance, sending tanks in broad movements to cut off German and Italian forces and their supply lines, and seizing favorable situations on the ground to occupy military strongholds. However, the greatest goal of this battle is the annihilation of the enemy forces.</p>
<p>British Victory in the Western Desert Will Change the International Situation</p>
<p>London, 21st (Reuters) – A diplomatic correspondent for the Daily Telegraph states that as the Soviet Union is resisting the Nazi invasion and the British Eighth Army is launching a fierce offensive in Libya, the attitude of many countries towards Germany and the war situation is worthy of consideration. A British victory in Libya will definitely have a significant impact in many countries. The effects can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Turkey – British victory will strengthen Turkey's ability. Recently, Turkey has gradually shown a determination to resist German threats.</p>
<p>Spain – The Axis is gradually being hated by the Spanish people because they are struggling under hardship and famine and feel that all this suffering is caused by the Germans. They have questioned the possibility of German victory. If the British army in Libya wins a major victory, Spain's situation will change even more.</p>
<p>Japan – A British victory in the Mediterranean will allow the British fleet to be redeployed elsewhere, which will have a significant impact on the development of Japan's policies and plans.</p>
<p>Equatorial Africa – The morale of the people in Equatorial Africa is currently low under Vichy rule. If the British army wins in Libya, morale there will be greatly boosted.</p>
<p>Soviet Union – After a major British victory in Libya, the German side will definitely withdraw its frontline troops from the Soviet front and move them to the Pyrenees Mountains. Germany may seize key points on both the north and south sides of the Strait of Gibraltar in order to block the western route to the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Italy – There are already signs of resistance against the Fascist regime and advocacy of a separate peace in Italy. A large number of German troops are on alert to prevent Italy from leaving the war. If the British army wins in Libya, and the Allies directly pressure Rome, Germany will further divide its forces to engage in defense.</p>
<p>Franco-German Cooperation Develops</p>
<h3>General Weygand Suddenly Dismissed, U.S.-French Relations Worsen, Washington to Re-examine Policy Towards Vichy</h3>
<p>Washington, 21st (Associated Press) – U.S.-French relations, which have deteriorated due to rumors that the Vichy government is intensifying cooperation with Nazi Germany, reached the brink of collapse yesterday with Vichy's announcement of Weygand's dismissal. Reliable sources say that the United States is not yet likely to withdraw its recognition of the Vichy government, but Congressman Heidinger, a Republican from New Hampshire, will propose today that the United States recognize the "Free France" government led by General de Gaulle.</p>
<p>Washington, 20th (Havas) – The State Department issued a communiqué today stating, "It has come to our attention that the French government, at Hitler's request, has dismissed General Weygand, the French government's commissioner for its African territories, allowing Germany to control French territories. This action goes beyond the scope of the Franco-German armistice agreement. Therefore, the United States must re-examine its policy towards France. All previous plans to provide economic assistance to French North Africa will be temporarily suspended, and we will wait and see to what extent Hitler will use force or threats of force to seize the sovereignty and control of the French colonial empire."</p>
<h3>Vichy Appoints North Africa Commanders, Dismisses Weygand, Communiqué Explains Reasons</h3>
<p>Vichy, 20th (Havas) – The government today appointed Vice-Admiral Fenard as Permanent Secretary-General for French Africa, General Jouain as Commander-in-Chief of the French Army in North Africa, General Barrou as Commander-in-Chief of the French Army in West Africa, and Chatel promoted to Governor-General of French Algeria (Note: The original Governor-General of Algeria was concurrently held by General Weygand).</p>
<p>Vichy, 20th (Havas) – An official communiqué was released at 7 PM this month, announcing that the position of French government commissioner for African territories, currently held by General Weygand, would be abolished. Previously, Marshal Pétain had consulted various experts, who all agreed to the abolition. Their written opinions were also released by the government, stating that the establishment of the position of commissioner for African territories initially had three purposes: 1. To achieve close communication between Tunisia, Morocco, and Senegal, which were directly threatened; 2. To unify command of the territories in order to protect local natives and French expatriates from the effects of the blockade; 3. To concentrate administrative power in order to carry out national reconstruction; 4. To find ways to strengthen local defenses in order to protect the interests of the territories. Now that the French territories have been consolidated, General Weygand's mission can be said to have been completed. The position of special commissioner should now be abolished, as its continued existence would hinder the activities of local administrative bodies and affect the administrative relationship between the central and local governments.</p>
<h3>German Control of Northwest Africa Strategically Important</h3>
<p>French Border, 21st (Reuters) – Local French people believe that Weygand's departure will open up French North Africa, allowing a steady stream of Nazi personnel to enter and consolidate the connection between French North Africa and Nazi Germany before the British army drives to the Tunisian border. Berlin seems to have anticipated the outbreak of the British offensive and is urgently taking this action to put pressure on Vichy. Weygand's dismissal is also related to the Nazi attempt to control the West African coast, as the Atlantic bases on the West African coast can cut off British and American supply lines. Local French people generally believe that Weygand's dismissal is the greatest concession the Vichy government has made to Germany since the armistice and a victory for German diplomatic offensives, compensating for its setbacks on the Eastern Front. Some observers believe that Germany is now preparing to create a stage for a conference with its European vassal states to declare the unification of Europe and propose peace terms to Britain, as the German internal front is somewhat shaken by the continued resistance of the Soviet Union. This move is necessary. Berlin believes that without Vichy's cooperation, the peace offensive will not have sufficient force to be worth holding. At the same time, Germany still intends to requisition more troops from vassal states to fight against the Soviet army on the Eastern Front. Germany has asked Vichy to send 300,000 troops to the Eastern Front to perform garrison duties. If Vichy agrees, the French army will follow the Italian, Romanian, and Hungarian convoys to the front lines. Political observers believe that Britain's tightening of the blockade of the Mediterranean will be one of the results of Weygand's departure. The delivery of American supplies to North Africa was conditional on Weygand not allowing the Germans to interfere in the territory. In the future, the residents of North Africa will inevitably feel great hardship, and Britain will impose stricter restrictions on North African exports passing through the Mediterranean to France. The crisis of Darlan ordering the French fleet to sail again will occur.</p>
<h3>Brinon Returns to Vichy to Discuss Political Issues</h3>
<p>Vichy, 21st (Reuters) – According to the German official news agency, Brinon, Vichy's envoy to occupied France, has returned to Vichy to discuss outstanding political issues with Marshal Pétain.</p>
<h3>German Submarine that Attacked HMS Ark Royal Sunk</h3>
<p>London, 21st (Reuters) – The Admiralty announced that the British gunboat HMS Malegot recently destroyed a German submarine in the area where the British aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal was torpedoed two days ago. Since the submarine was patrolling the sea in the area where the Ark Royal sank, it must have been the submarine that attacked the Ark Royal. The British gunboat first attacked with depth charges, forcing the German submarine to surface. The British ship immediately opened fire, and the German submarine was hit and sank. The crew jumped into the water, and 34 people were rescued and became prisoners of war.</p>

<h3>German Forces Advance on Rostov Along Arc-Shaped Line, Soviet Union Admits Kerch Has Fallen, No Change in Central Sector</h3>
<p>London, 21st (Reuters) – Reliable sources in London stated today that the weather on the Soviet front is extremely cold, but there is still intense fighting everywhere. Soviet forces are launching localized counter-offensives. Recent Soviet communiqués mentioned major battles in Rostov, Volokolamsk, and Tula. Although Soviet forces on the Crimean Peninsula were forced to withdraw from Kerch due to being unable to withstand the overwhelming German equipment, in other parts of the peninsula, Soviet forces have recovered several key high grounds, forcing the German army to retreat, abandon its occupied positions, and reorganize new front lines. It is reported that the German army is constantly attacking the fortresses in front of Sevastopol. The Red Star newspaper reported that the German army is advancing vigorously, but is being bravely repelled by the defenders of Sevastopol. Other news from the southern front stated that the German army was heavily defeated and surrounded near Novocherkassk, 25 miles northeast of Rostov. At the same time, the German army is conducting a frontal attack on Rostov along an arc-shaped line, which stretches from Novocherkassk in the north to the Sea of Azov in the west. Despite suffering heavy losses, the German army is still trying to advance. General Guderian, a tank specialist of the vanguard unit, recently commanded the war situation in various areas in front of Moscow as follows:</p>
<p>Tula Sector: According to a war correspondent from the Soviet newspaper, the German army launched an offensive on Tuesday, attempting to attack Tula, 110 miles south of Moscow. They continued their offensive on Wednesday, but were repelled, although there was still fierce fighting. The German side assembled a large army and tanks to fight. The war situation in areas D and B is still serious. In two villages about three miles from Tula, the German army was severely hit and only withdrew after suffering heavy losses. On Wednesday night, Soviet artillery heavily bombarded the German infantry concentration in the town of Novobasovo. The next morning, a Soviet reconnaissance team entered the town and saw German corpses lying everywhere in every house.</p>
<p>Volokolamsk Sector: According to Moscow news, the German side sent five infantry divisions and three tank divisions to fight. The battle was very bloody, and the Soviet army was forced to withdraw from several villages. Another German infantry unit, assisted by 100 tanks, made slight progress, but was stopped by the Soviet infantry. A regiment of the Soviet army fought all day in this area, killing 700 German soldiers.</p>
<p>Maloyaroslavets and Mozhaisk Sectors: The German army had little activity other than patrols.</p>
<p>Kalinin Sector: After a day of fierce fighting, two German regiments occupied three villages, but were forced to withdraw from two villages after a Soviet counter-offensive. The German army in Kalinin City only engaged in reconnaissance, with some machine gun fire and shelling. The German side continued to concentrate infantry and tanks around Kalinin. On Tuesday, the Soviet Air Force destroyed 75 German trucks carrying infantry and ammunition, killing or wounding about 1,000 German soldiers.</p>
<p>Leningrad Sector: The German army in the Leningrad area tried to advance in the V and P sectors twice in the past few days, but failed, leaving 400 corpses behind. The Soviet side also stated that the German army in the important railway city of Tikhvin, 110 miles southeast of Leningrad, seems to have temporarily lost its momentum. The Soviet army has recovered several villages in this area. The Soviet Air Force continued to provide active assistance to the army.</p>
<p>London, 21st (Reuters) – A Reuters military commentator stated that the Soviet side admitted yesterday that Kerch had fallen. The German army had superiority in numbers and aircraft in the southern sector, so the position was indeed difficult to hold for long. The Soviet side said that the Soviet army heavily damaged the German army before withdrawing from Kerch City in an orderly manner, defending the opposite bank of the strait. It will be very difficult for the German army to build a bridgehead across this eight-mile-wide strait. There was no change in the war situation in the remaining areas of the front.</p>
<h3>Soviet Fleet Achieves Remarkable Results, Sinking Over 10,000 Tons of Ships</h3>
<p>Moscow, 21st (Reuters) – A Soviet midnight communiqué stated that Soviet ships sank no less than 15,000 tons of Axis ships in the Barents Sea and the Black Sea yesterday. In the Barents Sea, Soviet ships sank three enemy transport ships totaling 1,900 tons and one oil tanker with a displacement of 5,000 tons. In the Black Sea, Soviet ships sank one enemy oil tanker with a displacement of 9,000 tons.</p>

<h3>Silver Coin Cup Table Tennis Tournament - Group Champions Already Determined - Siming and North America Triumph Respectively - Top Six Semifinals Start Next Week</h3>
<p>The 4th Silver Coin Cup Team Table Tennis Championship, hosted by Chuan Guiqing and Ye Xuebin, has been proceeding very smoothly since the competition affairs began. The group round-robin matches have been going on for more than a month, with winners and losers gradually emerging. The night before, Siming showed great power, defeating the defending champion Zhongxu with a huge score of thirteen to three, and leaping to win the title of the Silver Group. The runner-up was won by the emerging powerhouse Juxingcheng. Zhongxu's team was incomplete and finished third. In the final of the Mu Qian Group, the defending runner-up Zhe Xing met a strong opponent, North America. As a result of the fierce battle, Zhe Xing weakened after a strong start, and was tragically defeated by North America with a score of eight to thirteen, which was unfortunate. North America relied on its final efforts to win the Qian Group championship, which can be said to be not easy. As for the Citibank team, the oldest in the banking industry, all the participants in this competition are new talents.

<h3>Double Horse Spot Sales are Heavily Shorted - Plummeting to the Limit Immediately After Market Opening</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to be sluggish and the situation was quite weak. This was due to the unfavorable environment, and many spot traders were shorting, resulting in ample chips, so the market continued to decline. The Double Horse factory announced a limit-down immediately after the morning opening, at 2,790 yuan. However, the decline in the dark market remained severe. This was because the Exchange's February and March contracts all fell miserably at the same time. The rebound in gold, and the sharp drop in particular, made the bulls even more uneasy and the selling intensified. The lowest price for Double Horse factory orders outside the dark market was 2,630 yuan. As for spot yarn transactions, all were suspended. The price of Double Horse foreign warehouse goods was surprisingly 150 to 180 yuan cheaper than factory orders, a huge difference. In the afternoon, Double Horse factory orders stopped trading and there was no market due to the limit-down, but the Exchange saw a rebound in the afternoon after a sharp fall in the morning. Today, 150 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<p>The Double Horse futures market situation, sometimes up, sometimes down, the trend is extremely volatile. This is because the customs ban on transportation is not lifted, and international negotiations are sometimes slow and sometimes tight, resulting in rumors rising, sometimes bullish, and then bearish. Such a volatile situation makes people feel uneasy and unsure of what to do. When the market opened in the morning, although the factory order first fell to the limit-down, because the yarn futures had already fallen yesterday, the yarn futures were opened for trading. The December contract has stopped trading, and the February contract has begun to appear. At first, because retail investors still had the intention to enter, the trend was still strong. The December futures opened at 2,600 yuan, up 60 yuan, and the January futures at 2,730 yuan, also up 60 yuan. Then, the sharp drop in the gold market caused great unease among the bulls, so they sold off one after another. Therefore, the February contract opened with a sluggish trend, at 2,740 yuan, down 20 yuan. After entering the afternoon, the February and March contracts fluctuated, but were still mostly weakening. At the close of the morning session, except for the near-term contracts which were slightly stronger, the distant contracts were down 70 to 100 yuan each. The February contract once fell to a low of 2,660 yuan. In the afternoon, following the overall slump in the morning, most people were panicked. Large investors and speculators mostly sold heavily first. The December contract opened at the lowest price of 2,470 yuan, and the January contract also opened at a low price of 2,580 yuan. After entering the market, with the gold price turning strong, the market sentiment suddenly rose, and each month's contract rebounded by more than 100 yuan one after another. As a result, the December contract was still up 60 yuan, the January contract was flat, and the February contract was down 20 yuan compared to the opening price. The table is listed below:</p>
<p>December January February</p>
<p>Opening 2600.0 2730.0 2740.0</p>
<p>Highest 2650.0 2740.0 2760.0</p>
<p>Lowest 2470.0 2580.0 2660.0</p>
<p>Closing 2600.0 2670.0 2720.0</p>
<p>Comparison Up 60.0 Flat ...</p>
<p>Coarse Cotton Fell 30 to 40 Yuan</p>
<p>The current cotton situation continues to be weak. This is because gold has fallen sharply and the black exchange rate has been lengthened, making speculators feel indifferent. As a result, there is a lack of buyers. Coarse cotton fell by a huge 30 to 40 yuan. Yesterday, more than 200 bags of fire engine grass bales were traded, with a warehouse delivery price of 505 yuan.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market was closed yesterday for Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market was bland and unremarkable. First, the stock market rose sharply, causing speculators to buy in and the price to rise. Then, professional traders sold off, and some bulls closed positions, causing a slight decline. As a result, yesterday's closing prices rose or fell by about half a rupee each. It is also predicted that the market situation at the opening today will be similar to the closing prices.</p>
<h3>Consistent Selling Pressure - Gold Price Plummets - Down 2,250 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market's spot market and dark market saw a sudden expansion of the downward trend, tending to fall. The price successively broke through the 18,000 yuan and 17,000 yuan marks. It once again entered the 16,000 yuan mark. The bearish rumors caused by the new negotiations between the United States and Japan became even more prevalent, and all parties became even more apprehensive. Therefore, although there was a huge amount of hoarding by banks, with securities firms and remittance merchants each entering about 1,200 taels, and Decheng entering more than 400 taels, Xianghe dumped 1,020 taels, Xiangxing Yong sold 500 taels, Shunyuan sold 400 taels, and Mingfeng sold 240 taels. The supply of Tianyuan and other firms exceeded demand, causing the price to plummet from 17,950 yuan to a low of 15,800 yuan, which is one-third lower than the all-time high of 23,100 yuan on October 31. In the afternoon, low-price buyers became active, but the market situation had already weakened, so the price rebounded by 1,000 yuan, but then fell sharply again, and ultimately closed down 1,250 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 24,940 taels. The lowest price for gold ornaments was 1,620 yuan, and the final price was 1,640 yuan, down 230 yuan. Silver bullion was down 2 yuan, at 24 yuan. The black market fell to about 20 yuan.</p>
<p>Cash Prices Broke Through Two Major Levels in a Row</p>
<p>Since morning, every bar (10 taels) was already under selling pressure when the market opened at 9 o'clock, and it had already been pushed down to within 18,000 yuan, at 17,700 yuan. When Shihe and Hongqing Yong sold down to as low as 17,600 yuan, Yongcheng, Hesheng, and securities firms bought up, and the price immediately soared by 350 yuan, to 17,950 yuan. Shihe then began to sell off again, and Chengji, Yifeng, and Tianyuan also sold off. The price then plummeted again by 1,150 yuan, falling to 16,800 yuan. Gonghe, Mingfeng, securities firms, etc. vigorously entered the market, raising the price by 700 yuan, reaching 17,500 yuan. However, amid rumors of negative news, selling pressure soon rose again. Tianyuan, Xianghe, Xiangxing Yong, Mingfeng, Yifeng, Gonghe, and Hesheng sold more and more vigorously, and the market price plummeted again by 1,700 yuan, falling to 15,800 yuan at noon. The closing price at noon was 15,900 yuan. When the market opened at 2 pm, the price was still 15,900 yuan. Tianyuan and Mingfeng suddenly covered their short positions, and Chengfei, Hesheng, and securities firms and remittance merchants also entered the market, and the price suddenly rose, soaring by 1,000 yuan, reaching 16,900 yuan. Xianghe, Yongcheng, Xiangxing Yong, and Shunyuan sold vigorously, and the price fell back to the 16,000 yuan mark. This shows that people's hearts are turned downwards. The closing price was 16,100 yuan, down a huge 2,250 yuan compared to the previous day. It has been reported that it has fallen for two consecutive days, a total of 3,430 yuan. On the same day, the cash store's own brand of gold had a selling price of 16,300 yuan, and the purchase price was 1,000 yuan lower than the selling price.</p>
<p>Gold Ornaments Down 230 Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange price of gold ornaments per tael in jewelry stores was lowered seven times by Datonghang and Xintonghang in the morning, for a total decrease of 250 yuan, retreating to 1,620 yuan. In the afternoon, it rebounded by 80 yuan, to 1,700 yuan, and then fell again by 60 yuan, to 1,640 yuan (purchase price minus 150 yuan), down 230 yuan.</p>
<h3>Black Market Exchange Rate Sought After All Day - No Buyers Found - Foreign Currency Suffers a Great Blow - US Dollars Once Entered at 30 Yuan</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market situation yesterday, the Central Bank and HSBC's posted prices had no ups and downs. The prices of HSBC and other small counter prices were all flat. In the black market for British and American exchanges, Chinese merchants were seeking to sell all day long, but there was little demand from importers, so the British exchange rate of 2/1/25 and the American exchange rate of 3/3.75 were available for settlement, but there were no transactions. Even telegraphic transfers drawn in the United States were not asked about.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 21st (Friday) Electricity, This morning the exchange market opened stable and abnormal, the market situation still has no honor or disgrace,</p>
<p>Tianjin, 21st (Friday) Electricity, This morning the exchange market opened flat, London and New York telegraphic transfers still opened the original market number, Lianchao dark market also has no honor or disgrace, Shen exchange alone fell three yuan, to seventy-two yuan,</p>

<h3>Domestic Debt Remains Popular</h3>
<p>The black market for public bonds fluctuated greatly yesterday afternoon, with a difference of several jiao per yuan. Those who raised the price were afraid that it would not be high enough, but the high price attracted distant goods, and spot goods were also flowing out. It was said that the negotiations between Japan and the United States were going smoothly, but the matter was still in a standstill. Those holding goods were hanging on for a good price, but in fact the market was still speculating, with different opinions and different views. Type C rose to 71 yuan, which is still the highest price in nearly two months, but the trend may not necessarily shrink suddenly. Yesterday morning, Type C opened at 70 yuan, and then gradually rose, approaching 71 yuan. There were quite a few buyers in the market. Tongyi, Dazhong, Xiexing, Yuanlian, Yishun, Tai and general retail investors all bought in. The popularity of the market was excellent. When the market opened in the afternoon, Senji bought in first, and Dazhong Shengxing Lianhe and others continued to buy in. Type C broke through the 71 yuan mark, which caused spot goods to flow out of the financial industry. Yitai, Dingkang, Runde, Yifei, etc. entered Type C and then retreated to 70 yuan at the close. The situation was confusing. As a result, the market price, except for Type D, which rose sharply by 1 yuan and 5 jiao, the rest rose slightly by 1 jiao, 3 jiao to 5 jiao. The transaction volume was nearly 3 million yuan. A brief table is listed below. Category Highest Lowest Closing Price Compared to the Previous Day</p>

<p>In stock trading, 400 shares of new shares of Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory were traded, with a price of 32 yuan and 5 jiao per share.</p>
<p>In addition, the OTC market outside the public exchange was confusing. At first, due to the weekend short covering, the price did not plummet along with gold and yarn, etc. The market situation was stable for a long time, and finally, due to the release of floating longs, the price was forced to decline.</p>

<h3>Aboard the President Liner to the Philippines: American Troops Withdraw in Two Batches; Troop Transport Ship "President Madison" Arrives; Defense Zone Taken Over by the Shanghai Municipal Council; British Embassy Officially Announces Evacuation of Nationals on "Anhui"</h3>
<p>The American President Lines' mail steamer "President Madison" arrived punctually yesterday (at 3:30 PM) and berthed at buoys 14 and 15. Passengers disembarked at the New Customs wharf between 5 PM and 6 PM yesterday via the company's small launches. It is reported that the steamer is scheduled to depart for the Philippines next Tuesday or Wednesday. A portion of the U.S. Marine Corps Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai will also withdraw to Luzon on this vessel. The regiment's base began transporting materials to Wharf No. 4 on the Bund yesterday morning, loading them onto iron barges for transport to the large ship, and the withdrawal was exceptionally busy throughout the day. Another portion of the American troops is planned to leave on the "President Harrison" liner. This ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 25th, but it is now known that there has been a slight delay and it will probably not arrive until the 27th, with departure scheduled for the 29th or Sunday (the 30th). Both liners will be carrying a large quantity of American goods for transshipment, but will not be loading Shanghai export goods.</p>
<p>Fourth Regiment's Withdrawal in Two Batches</p>
<p>The U.S. Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai will withdraw in two batches, and on both occasions, they will march in formation along Jing'an Temple Road and Nanjing Road eastward to board the ships, thus ending their 14-year history in Shanghai. It is expected that Chinese and foreign citizens will gather along the roadside at that time to see off the American troops.

Colonel Howard, accompanied by Major Hamilton, successively met with Major Artigue, commander of the French Infantry Mixed Battalion in China, Lieutenant Colonel Galetti of the Italian forces, and Commander Hullett of the British Navy. From 6 PM to 8 PM last night, the American Chamber of Commerce hosted Colonel Howard and other American officers at the American Club.

The American Club will be open on Monday evening for American officers and soldiers to bid farewell to friends.</p>
<p>British Nationals Evacuated on the "Anhui"</p>
<p>The British Embassy in Shanghai officially announced yesterday morning that the British ship "Anhui" will sail from Shanghai around the 28th of this month, carrying British nationals evacuated from Japanese-occupied areas of China. According to a British official answering reporters' questions, it is hoped that British nationals in North China will arrive in Shanghai as soon as possible to board the "Anhui." When asked about the destination of the "Anhui," the official replied that this matter had not yet been finally decided, but it could be stated that when the "Anhui" evacuated British nationals from Japan, it sailed to India. The ship can carry 500-600 passengers. When the authorities notify British nationals to board the ship, they will include detailed regulations regarding the amount of luggage allowed. As for reasonable personal luggage, it will not be restricted.</p>
<p>British to Send Further Ships for Evacuation</p>
<p>It is now hoped that the "Anhui" will not be required to sail north to Tianjin, as the authorities are now preparing to ensure that British nationals in North China arrive in Shanghai as early as possible to catch the "Anhui." The British Embassy's announcement stated roughly that arrangements have been made for the "Anhui" to arrive in Shanghai around November 28 to carry evacuated British nationals from the occupied areas. However, the ship has limited capacity, and there are many registered British nationals, so it will not be able to carry all of them. However, the authorities will soon find a way to send more ships to Shanghai to evacuate nationals.</p>
<p>Some British Nationals Plan to Take a French Ship</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that some British and American nationals evacuating from Shanghai plan to take the Messageries Maritimes' "Benares Saint-Hilaire" to Manila to change ships back to America. This ship is scheduled to cast off from buoys 12 and 13 in the Huangpu River at 3 PM this afternoon and sail to Manila. It is also known that the company has three more ships sailing to Shanghai this month: the "Los" is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 23rd, carrying a large quantity of rice from Saigon; the "General Joffre," loaded with 2,800 bags of rice, also stopping at Manila, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 25th; and the "D'Artagnan," also loaded with 4,815 bags of rice, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 29th.</p>
<p>Defense to be Received by Police</p>
<p>The question of who will take over the defense of Sector C of the International Settlement after the withdrawal of the U.S. Fourth Regiment remains to be discussed and announced by the Defense Forces Special Committee. It is understood that the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department will take over completely, and there should be no problems with the handover at that time. However, there is no definite information on how the defense will be arranged thereafter.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Postal Rates to Increase Next Month</h3>
<p>Regarding the increase in domestic postal rates by the Shanghai Postal Administration, the Datong News Agency reporter interviewed Mr. Wang Weisheng, the postal assistant. He admitted that the Southwest Postal Administration had indeed started raising prices on the 1st of this month. Shanghai, due to environmental reasons, requires considerable time for coordination. However, according to his information, this matter can be implemented no later than the 1st of next month. He also said that from the 1st of next month, in addition to Shanghai implementing the price increase, other occupied areas and North China can also begin simultaneously, and the amount of the postal rate increase will be the same as that implemented in the Southwest, without any differences. At present, the Southwest and Fujian-Zhejiang have already implemented the price increase, and it is unavoidable that there are differences in postal rates between the various places and Shanghai and North China. However, this is only a temporary phenomenon at the beginning of implementation and is not surprising.</p>
<h3>Funeral Parlors and Coffin Depositories to Increase Depository Fees</h3>
<p>Funeral parlors and coffin depositories, newly emerging businesses in the city after the war, have recently claimed that expenses such as disinfectants, taxes, timber, water, electricity, and employee salaries have increased. From January 1 next year, all fees will be increased by 50% compared to the old prices, which will further increase the burden on the common people who deposit coffins.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Steamers All Requisitioned; Japanese Transporting Troops to Hubei; "Fengyang Maru" Sails from Gaochangmiao; Extremely Strict Inspection of Food and Drink on Board</h3>
<p>Since the Chinese army left Wuhan, the Yangtze River route has been completely controlled by the Japanese Navy, and shipping is monopolized by the Japanese company, Toa Shipping, formerly Nisshin Shipping. Originally, there were seven or eight Yangtze River steamers, including the "Xiangyang Maru," "Fengyang Maru," and "Yueyang Maru," which has now expanded to over twenty vessels.</p>
<p>Recently, they have been requisitioned by the Japanese Navy, mostly for transporting troops. The "Fengyang Maru" sailed from Gaochangmiao on the 18th of this month with a ship full of troops (approximately one thousand). The crew, sailors, and other workers of the "Fengyang Maru" were subjected to extremely strict inspections. Their resumes had to be registered in detail again, and the food and drink on board were also inspected. The water supply had to be checked every two hours. The troops being transported were not Japanese. There are also over ten Japanese ships loading troops in Nanjing to go to Yuezhou. It is unknown what the Japanese army intends to do in the near future. Most of the Yangtze River steamers of the Toa Shipping Company are now suspended from operation for transporting troops.</p>
<h3>Passenger Cabin Bookings to Hong Kong Not Allowed; Tickets Only Sold Six Days Before Departure</h3>
<p>Currently, shipping between Shanghai and Hong Kong relies entirely on the British companies, Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson. The Hong Kong government's regulations for passengers to Hong Kong are extremely strict, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the British Embassy has ordered the two companies that bookings for all classes of cabins to Hong Kong are not allowed. Tickets can only be sold six days before a certain ship's confirmed departure date from Shanghai to Hong Kong; otherwise, they will be invalid.</p>
<h3>Expansion of Controlled Goods Scope for Imports and Shanghai Products; Market Transactions to Reduce Speculation; Materials Committee to be Reorganized</h3>
<p>Since the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Liddell, returned to Shanghai, he submitted a report to the Council stating that the Price Stabilization Committee will fully support the authorities of the two settlements in controlling commodity prices. Therefore, the Council has decided to actively implement and expand the scope of control over all daily necessities. It plans to abolish the existing Materials Committee and establish three new committees for coal, rice, and daily necessities, to further control the import, distribution, and production of the controlled items, in order to reduce market speculation and achieve greater results.</p>
<p>Scope of Price Limits to Expand</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has currently issued price limits for over 360 items. In the future, the scope of these restrictions will be further expanded. The Coal Committee will have subcommittees for industrial and domestic use. The Rice Committee will have subcommittees for wheat and flour. The Daily Necessities Committee will include importers and manufacturers, with experts as members, so that all control measures can be thoroughly implemented. Those who violate the control regulations will be subject to the most severe penalties, in order to completely eliminate speculative profiteering.</p>
<p>Random Inspection of Store Accounts</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council stipulated the maximum retail prices for several hundred items such as daily necessities, groceries, and medicines from the 18th, it will now ensure that retailers sell at the stipulated prices and prevent retailers from creating black market transactions. It will order all stores to record the quantity and price of goods sold daily in their accounts, for inspection by Council officials at any time. The Council will also implement this for foreign merchants who have jurisdictional rights and has the right to inspect their accounts.</p>
<p>Flour, Coal, and Oil to be Controlled Soon</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's efforts to promote the control of commodity prices in the International Settlement are currently preparing new measures to crack down on profiteering and hoarding, which will be announced within a few days. These measures concern the control of flour, coal, and edible oil. However, the details have not been disclosed. An official of the Council stated that the Council has specially ordered 64,000 bags of flour worth over 2 million yuan from the United States, which are expected to arrive in Shanghai within ten days. This is the first batch, as the Council has prepared to continue purchasing 100,000 bags of flour. The Council will also procure the first batch of 500 tons of edible oil within a few days, indicating that the Council will lower oil prices as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Gordon Road Police Station's Price Control Achievements</p>
<p>The Council previously saw that rice prices were rising endlessly and therefore implemented control, limiting the rice price to 130 yuan per dan (approximately 100 kg). It also directly purchased the best quality foreign rice from the producing areas and transported it to Shanghai to supply the needs of the citizens. Western specialists were appointed to check the standards of the rice quality, and a retail outlet was specially set up next to the Gordon Road Police Station. Each person was limited to purchasing one dou (approximately 10 liters), or even 1.2 liters, priced at 13 yuan per dou in legal tender. Because the location is spacious, there are many staff members, and they are all experienced, they are all kind and approachable to retail customers, and the order is orderly, without any crowding. Each minute they can serve over one hundred and three people. According to statistics from last week, the maximum number of people purchasing rice per day was 10,384, and the average number of people per day was about 7,000 to 8,000. Rice purchasing time is from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM, so that people working in factories in the western district have sufficient time to purchase rice, including Sundays and public holidays. The citizens are very pleased.</p>
<h3>Panama Ship Wrecked at the Mouth of the Song River</h3>
<p>The Panama freighter "Santaylena Iz" ran aground outside the mouth of the Wusong River on Wednesday night while sailing from Shanghai to Manila. This is the second ship to be wrecked outside the mouth in the past three days. The previous ship was the Japanese "Basae Maru," which sank outside the mouth, killing 200 people. According to people at the East Asia Company, which manages the "Santaylena Iz," the ship was not carrying passengers, and the general cargo was not valuable. After receiving the report here, the "Carmen Maeler" was immediately dispatched to the scene to provide assistance. As for the damage to the freighter or the casualties of the crew, details will not be known until the "Carmen Maeler" returns to Shanghai. It is currently impossible to communicate with the freighter. At the same time, according to Japanese shipping sources, divers have been dispatched to explore the "Basae Maru" since it sank on Sunday, but the ship has not yet been found.</p>
<p>Rongwu Buddhist Lecture Society</p>
<p>The 29th lecture of the Rongwu Buddhist Lecture Society, the second term of the National Studies lecture series, will still be held on the fourth floor of the Chinese Vocational Education Society on Hualong Road, starting at 2:00 PM on the 23rd.</p>
<p>Bread and Mantou Industry's Flour Inventory Survey</p>
<p>The Bread and Mantou Industry Association, in order to prevent hoarding by members, dispatched investigators to various bread and mantou shops from the 13th to investigate flour stocks and daily requirements, etc., which was completed yesterday. The association has over 400 members in the city. 260 shops applied to continue supplying flour at reasonable prices. As of the 17th, the total flour in stock was 1,018 bags, but none exceeded one month's self-use requirements. The daily flour requirement was 386 bags, which was reported to the Municipal Council for record. In addition, the investigation of member shops that have not yet joined the association is also underway, and it is hoped that information on all supply and demand matters related to flour will be reported to the investigation department of the Shanghai Bread and Mantou Industry Association at 202 Guangxi Road within a short period of time, so as to collect and statistically manage inventory and sales.</p>
<h3>This Year's Winter Relief More Important Than Previous Years; Hope Charities Handle it Carefully; Refugee Shelters Pilot Self-Sufficiency</h3>
<p>The United Federation of Charities of Shanghai, seeing that prices are soaring and people are struggling to make a living, although they have been suppressed, they are still far from what they used to be. The poor have no savings for clothing and food, and winter relief is more important than ever before. Now that the weather is turning cold, urgent discussions are needed. A meeting of various groups will soon be convened to discuss relief measures. Since the weather suddenly turned cold, the number of corpses on the streets has also increased again. Pushan Villa collected 19 adult corpses and 53 child corpses yesterday.</p>
<p>Expand Congee Distribution</p>
<p>The Charity Federation Relief Association, located in Renji Hall on Sixth Malu, has established dozens of shelters to relieve disaster-stricken refugees since the August 13th Incident, sheltering as many as 60,000 to 70,000 refugees. They have been gradually dispersed over the past four years. So far, the Ciyuan Shelter on North Zhejiang Road and the First and Second Women and Children Relief Centers still house more than 4,000 women, children, and orphans. In March of this year, a temporary congee distribution center was opened in the shelter, with about 3,000 people eating congee every day. It has been ten months now. As winter approaches and the severe cold presses in, the helpless and hidden poor are even more pitiful. The Association has decided to expand the number of congee eaters to 6,000 from January 1, 31st year of the Republic. All those who register, regardless of age, must provide two one-inch photos. After review, they will be issued a congee eating certificate for daily collection. The Association also plans to set up congee distribution points in Xujiahui. It is also reported that the Ningbo Road, Zhejiang Road, Dong Gujia Lane China Jinsheng Association, etc., seeing that this year's winter relief is serious, especially attention should be paid to the helpless and hidden poor, and they plan to unite with fellow benevolent groups to conduct a thorough investigation and provide food rations according to the population.</p>
<p>Refugee Self-Sufficiency</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, the Cilian General Association, and the Cilian Branch, after a previous meeting, decided that, in addition to the elderly, weak, disabled, women, children, and school-age children in the various shelters being adjusted separately and allowed to stay, all able-bodied adult refugees would be dismissed. It was stipulated that each adult would be given 50 yuan and each child 38 yuan. However, prices continue to soar, and it is not easy for refugees to find work outside. There are still over a thousand people temporarily living in the First Shelter on Dunxin Road who cannot be dismissed for a while. It is now heard that the Association has decided to pilot semi-self-sufficiency for these able-bodied refugees who have work, that is, to provide one meal of congee as usual every morning, and they must purchase the afternoon meal themselves. Rice that costs 35 cents per catty will only be sold for 20 cents. Those who stop working or contract a disease will still be exempt from self-sufficiency. If it is found that they are physically weak and unable to work, they will be sent to the old and weak shelters to stay. This measure was first piloted on the 15th of this month. On the one hand, it saves on supplies so that they can be maintained for a longer period of time, and on the other hand, it raises the refugees' awareness of self-reliance, so that they strive to participate in production and gradually break away from refugee life.</p>
<h3>Wife of a Certain Notable Organizes Home Economics Research Association</h3>
<p>The wife of a certain notable in the city, in order to promote thrift and implement a new life, has united with many like-minded women from the women's circle to discuss how to reform many bad habits in ordinary families. It is now heard that a "Home Economics Discussion Association" has been organized. Members must strictly adhere to the creeds of "no mahjong," "no smoking," and "no unnecessary socializing," and strive for thrift.</p>

<h3>Second Session of the Shen Bao Scholarship Begins; Warm Response from All Sectors; Anonymous Elderly Man Suggests Increasing Primary School Slots; Over 2,600 Yuan Received in Continued Donations</h3>
<p>Since the second phase of the scholarship campaign for Shen Bao readers began yesterday, there has been a warm response from all sectors, and donors continue to come one after another. The staff of this newspaper are deeply moved by this enthusiastic and benevolent spirit. It is expected that the amount raised in this phase of the scholarship will exceed the record of the previous phase, which is fortunate for the poor students.</p>
<p>Anonymous Elderly Man Adds Scholarship Slots</p>
<p>The anonymous elderly man who is most concerned about the scholarship wrote yesterday, "I wonder if the Readers' Scholarship was able to balance its budget last semester. Time flies, and the winter vacation is approaching in an instant. I suppose preparations are being made for the next phase. When I was at your newspaper last time, I mentioned that it might be possible to add a first-grade primary school group in the next semester, with a limit of 100 students, so that the children of cart pushers, maids, coolies, and laborers can all attend school. After two or three years, they would be able to recognize a little bit of writing and read newspapers, which may be beneficial to the world and people's hearts. I will bear the cost. I wonder if this can be adopted. As for the continued assistance for this phase, I will send it immediately."</p>
<p>Perfecting Measures, Still Under Discussion</p>
<p>This newspaper is very sympathetic to the elderly man's proposal. The original scholarship regulations stipulate that "primary schools must be at the end of the fourth grade before they can request assistance." The main purpose is that if children who have not been to school are allowed to apply, it will be difficult for applicants to fill out registration forms, and it will be even more difficult to assess their grades without standards. With the enthusiastic scholarship support from all sectors, and the willingness to treat all uneducated children equally and provide assistance, the staff are mindful that every cent and penny of donations is contributed by people from all walks of life who are tightening their belts. It is imperative that the donations are solemnly distributed based on academic performance. This is the newspaper's humble intention and purpose. Now, after reading the letter from the elderly man, which expresses the spirit of "treating all as brothers" and cherishing the desire to eliminate illiteracy, the goal is to enable these children who cannot afford to go to school to have the same opportunity to read and write. We deeply admire his benevolent intentions and righteous deeds. Now, after careful consideration, it is proposed to designate several well-run primary schools in the two concessions, allocate them according to the number of places donated by the elderly man, and introduce the children who cannot afford to attend primary school to enroll in the first grade of these designated primary schools. If the elderly man agrees with this principle, detailed measures will be discussed further and implemented soon.</p>
<p>Over 2,000 Yuan Received in Continued Donations</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Caicheng (Funeral gifts from friends and relatives) 1,000 yuan, Daqian Boxing Society 1,000 yuan, Mr. Wu Yonggang 192 yuan, Bingji 100 yuan, Zhengfang 100 yuan, Ge Dawei 100 yuan, Yizhi Society 34.5 yuan, Shen Fengbiao of Continental Hotel (monthly donation for this month) 20 yuan, Mr. Wu Tianqiu 19 yuan, Private Zide Elementary School senior and junior classmates (17.15 yuan, Yongji 16.11 yuan, Wushuang (manuscript fee) 10 yuan, Zhang Liu (manuscript fee) 8 yuan, Bai Mei (manuscript fee) 7 yuan, Xin Si Mutual Aid Society anonymous, Mrs. Pu Qiting, Pu Qiting, Ms. Pu Zouyunyu etc. 5 yuan each, Mr. Wu Weisheng 4 yuan, Zifang (manuscript fee) 3 yuan, Ni Cheng (lost and found) 3 yuan, Mr. Wu Zhengxin 2 yuan, Mrs. Yang 2 yuan, also Yang Shouzhen, Chen Yang Hepu Fukang, Pu Jieyuan, Miss Pu Weiying, Miss Pu Peiying, maid Hua Ma 1 yuan each, totaling 2,669.76 yuan. 33,277.33 yuan accumulated from the previous session (excluding those who have been paid), totaling 35,947.09 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tuberculosis Prevention Movement: Fundraising Proceeding Smoothly, Total Reaching 100,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The fundraising for the local tuberculosis prevention movement is proceeding very smoothly. As of yesterday, it has reached 100,000 yuan. The French community in this city is also enthusiastically contributing to the tuberculosis prevention movement. For example, the French Tramway Company donated 5,000 yuan, the Sino-French Bank 500 yuan, and other French businesses and individuals have also made substantial donations.

The driver of the accident was taken to the police station for investigation.</p>
<p>Yesterday at about 4:00 PM, a girl named Shen Maomao, eight years old, was getting off a trolleybus at the Xinzha Road and Mackinnon Road stop. The child suddenly fell off the bus, and her left leg was severely crushed by the wheels. A constable summoned a vehicle to take her to the hospital for treatment. However, another report said that the ticket seller was in a hurry to ring the bell and start the bus, and the child, being young and unable to stand firmly, fell to the ground.</p>
<h3>Burkill Road Robbery-Murder Case: Another Accomplice Apprehended; Yesterday, the Arrested Suspects Were Sent to Court for Interrogation; Family Members of the Victim Arrived to Testify About the Incident</h3>
<p>Tang Baoshan, an ophthalmologist from Guangdong, 38 years old, lived at No. 17, Dengxian Lane, Lane 344, Burkill Road. At 3:30 PM on the 20th, four robbers broke in. Two of them held pistols and threatened them not to make any noise. They robbed Tang of a ring, his sister Bao Tangshi of a diamond ring, his tenant Madam Wang Shao's two gold rings, and Xie Xushi's pair of glasses. At that moment, Tang Baoshan took the opportunity to strike one of the robbers on the head with a stool. The robber, named Xia Baosheng, was injured in the head and became enraged. He drew his pistol and fired four shots, hitting Tang in the left chest and left arm. He then called out to his accomplices and fled. At that time, patrolling constables also gathered after hearing the alarm. The robber Xia fled to the Baoxing Road intersection and was captured. Another robber, named Wang A'gen, from Tongzhou, 32 years old, fled into Tongchunfang on Burkill Road. Constables Nos. 2425 and others chased him. Wang drew his gun and resisted arrest. The police returned fire, and Wang was shot four times and fell to the ground. He was captured, and a pistol, without bullets, was seized. At that time, stray bullets injured Wu Nonghua's seven-year-old daughter, Wu Xiangzhen, who lived in Tongchunfang, and a passing woman, Zhao Lishi. Later, lawyer Wang Yaotang telegraphed the Xinzha Police Station to send detectives Wang Qishan and Yang Peizhang to investigate. At the victim Tang Baoshan's home, they found a Mauser pistol, four shell casings, and two bullets. They also transported the injured to the hospital separately. Tang Baoshan died soon after due to the severity of his injuries. The injured robber Wang A'gen was sent to the police hospital and died at 4:00 AM yesterday due to the severity of his injuries. His body was sent to the morgue for examination. The arrested robber Xia Baosheng was taken to the police station. Afterwards, another accomplice, He Yufu from Jiangbei, was arrested at No. 121 Mettian Road in the French Concession and taken into custody. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case and requested a postponement. Subsequently, witnesses Bao Tangshi, Wang Shao's, and Xie Xushi submitted statements proving the robbery and pointed out that Xia Baosheng was holding a pistol at the time. When questioned, Xia confessed to the robbery and admitted to shooting Tang to death. He Yufu's testimony was evasive. The judge ordered them to be detained pending a post-mortem examination of the body.</p>
<h3>Two Gangs of Thieves: Accomplices in Multiple Cases, Tried and Awaiting Judgment</h3>
<p>Notorious thieves Zhou Zhuliang, Shen Haiqing, Shen Guifan, and Chen Wenlong, all from Jiangbei, along with a leader still at large, met at 1:30 AM on October 16 in Room 420 of the Dahua Hotel on Tibet Road to plan a robbery of the hotel's accounts room. The case was discovered, and they were arrested by Chinese detectives Wang Runhe, Zhang Fafu, and Yang Chengjie of the Xinzha Police Station. A Mauser pistol, an automatic pistol, and 15 bullets were seized. They were sent to the First Special District Court, and the case was postponed. An investigation revealed that these people were accomplices of a large-scale organized gang of thieves. They were interrogated and detained separately. Yesterday morning, the police stations jointly sent the ten suspects to the Third Criminal Court for trial. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the case, filed a public prosecution for the crime of large-scale gang robbery, and stated that during the postponement, the investigation revealed that between December of last year and September of this year, the defendants had successively used weapons to rob the China Can Factory at No. 389 Maibai Road, a foreigner at No. 105 Jiangxi Road, a Race Course Road guest, Madam Chen Wangshi at No. 269 Xinzha Road, pedestrians Xu Xuemin and Xi Bingsheng on Mackinnon Road and Changping Road, and Huang Zhuan at No. 460 Dixiwei Road of over 40,000 yuan, and requested severe punishment.

<h3>Rickshaw Puller's Commendable Benevolence: Employer's Three Pieces of Cargo Lost En Route, Seeking Owner</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>Greetings. I am writing to inform you that a rickshaw puller named Li Changming picked up a passenger arriving in Shanghai from his hometown at Pier No. 5 on the Bund at 7:00 PM on November 19. The passenger asked him to load three pieces of cargo (one basket of Chinese cabbage, one bag of peanuts) and pull them to Nanyang Bridge Jialu Road in the French Concession. He then walked alongside the rickshaw. Unexpectedly, halfway there, he noticed that the passenger was gone. He then pulled the rickshaw to the destination to wait, but the person never arrived. So he sent the cargo to the Songshan Road Police Station for record. The passenger seems to be a poor villager. If he loses his goods, he will definitely be upset, or even mistakenly blame the rickshaw puller. For this reason, I am entrusting your esteemed newspaper to publish this information. I hope the owner will come to my place at No. 730, Edward Road, and invite the rickshaw puller to go to the police station together to identify the goods. Thank you for your trouble. Sincerely, Yang Jianwen. November 21st. Address: No. 730 Edward Road. Phone: 92916.</p>

<h3>Hitler's Military Advisor</h3>
<p>— He Kai</p>
<p>In the past two years and several months, Germany has often been able to attack the weakest point of the opponent's defense line in Poland, Northern Europe, Belgium, France, the Balkans, and the Soviet Union, achieving lightning victories. Before each military operation, political and economic preparations are always carried out, complementing each other, resulting in great effectiveness. This unprecedented strategic and political success is said to be due to the strength of Hitler alone.</p>
<p>However, in fact, there is someone else behind Hitler, planning strategies for him. That is Dr. Karl Haushofer. The Munich "Geopolitics Association" under his command has over a thousand well-known scientists who are constantly studying Germany's strategies for dominating the world, and this group is, in fact, Hitler's military advisor.</p>
<p>It is unprecedented in history for a head of state to have such a research institution. Whether it is Ribbentrop's diplomatic apparatus, Himmler's secret police, Goebbels' propaganda department, or Brauchitsch's Wehrmacht, it can be said that they are all to some extent under Haushofer's command.</p>
<p>In 1938, when Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, the German General Staff was deeply afraid that if the German army entered Czechoslovakia, France would immediately send troops to rescue them, but Haushofer determined that this was an overestimation, and the fact proved that this was indeed the case.</p>
<p>It was Haushofer who predicted that Poland could be conquered in 18 days, and it was also Haushofer who, regarding Brauchitsch's commander-in-chief's concern that the German mechanized forces would be troubled by the Polish wetlands, stated that an attack would be launched at an appropriate time to avoid rain.</p>
<p>During the landing operation in Norway, the German High Command felt quite uneasy, but Haushofer guaranteed that it would be successful.</p>
<p>When attacking France, Hitler accepted Haushofer's advice, stopped the German High Command's proposal to launch a swift attack, and waited for the opportunity to mature, eventually achieving an unprecedented victory. Subsequently, the dispatch of troops to North Africa, the Balkans, and the Soviet Union was undoubtedly based on Haushofer's advice.</p>
<p>Hitler is merely a demagogue, not a politician with a well-thought-out plan, nor a naturally gifted hero. Most of his world policies are due to Haushofer, and it is said that Chapter 16 of "Mein Kampf" regarding foreign policy was also written by Haushofer.</p>
<p>Haushofer was an army officer of the German Empire. During the First World War, he had been promoted to the rank of major general. After the war, he retired from the military and served as a professor at the University of Munich, lecturing on geopolitics, strongly advocating the inevitability of Germany's revival, which was supported by general students.</p>
<p>He and Hitler met about seventeen years ago, when the latter launched a coup in Munich, suffered a failure, and was imprisoned. At that time, he often visited Hitler.</p>
<p>After the Nazis seized power in 1933, Hitler immediately asked Haushofer to organize the "Geopolitics Association," which was an organization not subject to the interference of the military or the control of the party headquarters, and was empowered to obtain all information from the government's propaganda department, diplomatic apparatus, and secret police. Under Haushofer's command, over a thousand economists, psychologists, geographers, strategists, historians, and other experts engaged in investigation and research.</p>
<h3>Farewell! U.S. Marine Corps</h3>
<p>— Yangtze River</p>
<p>The U.S. troops stationed in China have been ordered to withdraw, and the Fourth Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps in Shanghai is also bidding farewell. "Goodbye, Shanghai." When the U.S. military returns to the new China in the future, they will surely be invited as honored guests and receive a warm welcome. Today, we reluctantly bid farewell and send off the Fourth Regiment on their journey. The more tense the situation in the Pacific, the more dangerous the waves, the greater the responsibility of the journey. Farewell! U.S. Marine Corps Fourth Regiment.</p>
<p>In 1853 (the third year of Xianfeng), during the Small Swords Society uprising, and in 1860 (the tenth year of Xianfeng), when the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom army approached Shanghai, the U.S. government successively sent troops to be stationed in Shanghai; after the signing of the treaty in Gengzi (the 26th year of Guangxu), the U.S. Department of War dispatched 500 Marines to be stationed in Tianjin and Peking.</p>
<p>The U.S. Marine Corps has been established for 166 years. The Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai was established on April 16, 1914, and has only 26 years of history. At first, it was stationed in Mexico and Santo Domingo, and it was not until 1927 that it was ordered to be transferred to China, arriving in Shanghai on a giant transport ship on February 24 of that year. At that time, it belonged to the Third Brigade of the Marine Corps, with the brigade headquarters located in Tianjin. On January 29, 1929, the Third Brigade was ordered to be disbanded. Except for the Fourth Regiment, the rest of the officers and soldiers of the U.S. military brigades returned to the United States in February of the following year. The Fourth Regiment was formed by the merger of two battalions. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war in 1937, at the request of the authorities of the Public Concession, the Second Brigade of the U.S. Marine Corps came to Shanghai in December to increase defenses. On February 18 of the following year, the Second Brigade, together with the Sixth Regiment and the anti-aircraft artillery unit, withdrew from China, leaving only the Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The U.S. Yangtze River Fleet continues to be stationed, with the flagship Luzon (575 tons) currently moored in the middle of the Huangpu River at the British naval pontoon, and the Wake (450 tons) patrolling the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The Tutuila (370 tons) is along the Chongqing riverbank. They will continue to be responsible for protecting U.S. citizens and property.</p>
<p>Farewell! U.S. Marine Corps Fourth Regiment, today we bid farewell to your departure from Shanghai, and we hope to warmly welcome you in the future, when you are invited to China to visit the new China!</p>
<p>Life</p>
<h3>Labor Under the Swastika</h3>
<p>— Miao Yong</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, serfs were part of the landlord's property, bound to the land and unable to leave. The situation of German workers today is similar to that of serfs in the Middle Ages, except that they are bound to their jobs rather than to the land.</p>
<p>In 1937, tens of thousands of young clerks were driven out of offices and into farms, highways, and factories to sell their labor. Countless workers were driven back and forth in this way. Without government permission, workers could not resign, and employers could not dismiss workers. However, the government had the power to summon any worker to leave their original job without the employer's consent and send them to another place to work.</p>
<p>At first, the Nazis forced traveling salesmen to work in the fields and factories; in 1938 and 1939, they began to use artisans, and 500,000 shops closed, and all employees joined the so-called Labor Front.</p>
<p>The lives of German workers have been completely militarized. Wages are legally fixed, and demanding higher wages is enough to incur severe punishment. Long working hours are also legally fixed and cannot be shortened. Vacations, membership, and leisure are all controlled by the Nazis. If a worker quits halfway, the authorities have the right to force them back - just as a feudal lord has the right to force a serf back.</p>
<p>Ancient feudal lords had the right to kill serfs. Under Nazi rule, every worker has a labor passport, which details the holder's training, abilities, and occupation. It is illegal to employ a worker without this passport. Therefore, if an employer reclaims the passport of a worker they consider reactionary, it is enough to starve them to death.</p>
<p>Forcing teenagers to work is also a kind of "virtuous policy" of Hitler. Since March 1938, the Nazis have ordered households across the country to report the names of children who have completed primary school to the responsible authorities. Schools also have special personnel responsible for assigning children to places that need child labor. Most of these children are only fourteen years old. Under private serfdom, only serfs give birth to serfs; under Nazi rule, every woman is a producer of slaves.</p>
<p>Under this inhumane control, there are more than 20 million workers living in a dark world. But who dares to say that they will never roar?</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>14. Living the Life of a Hero</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, it will slowly get better in a few days!" Begonia always answered like this. "Listen, the sound of artillery is getting louder day by day. People who escaped from over there haven't even had a quick meal. We're still thinking about taking medicine? Meibao, a cough is a minor illness, you don't need to worry about me!"</p>
<p>In China, people without medical knowledge generally think that a cough is the flu, until the coughing lasts too long and the patient's spirit weakens day by day, everyone says "this is tuberculosis;" at first, no one pays attention at all.</p>
<p>Now, Begonia has also made this mistake. Although he feels very tired when he coughs, and his body temperature seems to be higher than usual, these are symptoms that he has never experienced when coughing from a cold before; but due to the pressure of life and economic difficulties, he really doesn't dare to rashly step into the big door of a doctor's house.</p>
<p>For the past few days, he has always been holding a piece of rock sugar in his mouth, because only this method can make his coughing a little better.</p>
<p>This evening, after he asked Zhang Yincai for leave and was not approved, he reluctantly dragged his tired body, walking step by step along Changbang Road; when he was about to reach a corner, suddenly two people came face to face, fighting and chasing all the way, neither of them paying attention to him, by the time he wanted to avoid it was already too late."

<h3>Foot-Powered Saw</h3>
<p>— Yong Yun</p>
<p>Sawing has always been a very strenuous task, but now there is a foot-powered saw. When sawing, you only need to step on it with your foot, as easily as playing a piano. It is a machine called a counter-hammer that makes the sawing pressure generated by each footstep equal. This new tool is very simple and can be installed on a workbench with little effort, and any size and any form of saw can be applied. There will be no danger when installing and dismantling the saw.</p>

<h3>Stomach Disease Scriptures</h3>
<p>Judging the Quality of Stomach Medicine. Any stomach medicine that, after being taken continuously for half a month, shows no improvement and the dosage needs to be increased can be determined to be absolutely difficult to cure stomach diseases and may even worsen them. Conversely, any medicine that, after being taken continuously for half a month, shows complete or partial healing and allows the dosage to be gradually reduced, can be trusted to cure the stomach disease. There are many stomach medicines on the market, but only "Chubing" allows the dosage to be gradually reduced and even eradicate the disease and restore health.</p>
<p>Treating Stomach Disease Requires Treating Stomach Ulcers. The root of chronic stomach disease lies in stomach ulcers. Stomach medicines containing anesthetics, baking soda, or calcium-magnesium substances can absolutely not cure stomach ulcers, and therefore can never cure chronic stomach disease. "Chubing" is a newly invented aluminum compound that can effectively and quickly heal stomach ulcers, and therefore can cure chronic stomach disease. Stopping stomach pain is secondary.</p>
<p>"Chubing" Overwhelms Famous Foreign Medicines. It has often been heard that chronic stomach disease sufferers have taken foreign stomach medicines for many years without any improvement in their condition, or even worsening it. However, after taking "Chubing" for a month, they report that the disease has been completely eradicated and health has been restored! Furthermore, according to reports from many doctors, the effectiveness of "Chubing" in curing stomach diseases has indeed exceeded all expensive stomach medicines from the East and West. Other low-grade medicines are not worth mentioning. This is truly good news for stomach disease sufferers and an honor for the domestic industry. Produced by Tianping Pharmaceutical Factory. All kinds of packaging and pocket boxes are sold in major pharmacies and companies. Trial packs are sold in cigarette paper shops.</p>
<p>Arts and Entertainment</p>
<h3>Discussing the Fate of "Confucius"</h3>
<p>— Zhou Jintao</p>
<p>"Confucius," which had a fleeting run in Shanghai, is now scheduled for a re-release. The director of "Confucius" is Mr. Fei Mu. Mr. Fei's directorial achievements are quite reputable. According to the information in the special issue on "Confucius," it is known that the director and production team put in a great deal of effort. Logically, a film produced with such great effort and with special promotion, and whose material and main character are the most revered teacher of China, Confucius, known both at home and abroad, should have been a box office hit and welcomed everywhere. However, unexpected things often happen in Shanghai. It was shown at the Jincheng Cinema for only a short time before being replaced. And it took almost a year before it was re-released in Shanghai. Confucius only served as Prime Minister of Lu for three months before being forced to leave Shandong. Thousands of years later, when filmed, he was rejected by Shanghai in less than half a month. Is his fate destined to be so? Writing this, I cannot help but lament for the most revered teacher!</p>
<p>The reason why "Confucius" failed to be a box office success is: a lack of connection. But this cannot be entirely blamed on the screenwriter's skills, simply because Confucius's life was one of constant movement, lacking stability. He spent much time traveling among the various states, sometimes not even staying a week before moving on. Another reason is that the film uses literary Chinese sentences from books like the Analects. I presume the screenwriter's intention was to avoid losing the original meaning and tone by translating it into vernacular Chinese. This inevitably overlooks the audience's literary cultivation. A remedy would be to add subtitles to the film, like the Chinese subtitles added to Western films, so that if viewers cannot hear clearly, they can read the added subtitles. In all fairness, this film is worth watching. Especially in these times and places where black and white are indistinguishable, right and wrong are confused, and righteousness is waning. What is most pitiful is the Shanghai audience. Some are too naive. They not only cannot understand domestic art films, but they also have no interest in Western art or biographical films.</p>
<p>I remember once when "The Eternal Teacher" was released in Shanghai, those with more education were so moved that they even shed tears, considering it valuable and meaningful. However, a large portion of the "gentlemen" and "ladies" found it incomprehensible, and the box office was not strong, naturally shortening the run. To be frank and blunt, I suspect that among the "gentlemen" and "ladies" who go to first-run theaters to watch Western films, perhaps only 30 to 40 percent can fully understand English. The other 50 to 60 percent just go to join the crowd, sit for two hours, and then, upon emerging, boast in social circles that they have seen such-and-such a film. My point is that film producers and cinemas should not always prioritize money. They must also bear some responsibility for educating the public and the audience. A film studio should produce at least one relatively profound and educational film every two years; a cinema should show at least two films each year that are not very profitable but have educational value for the audience. In this way, the audience's perspective can be gradually elevated, achieving the ultimate goal of entertainment without forgetting education.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Central Propaganda Department should reward films of this kind, both materially and in terms of honor. I believe that if this film "Confucius" can receive an award from the Central Propaganda Department, the Shanghai audience, who were not satisfied the last time, will flock to see it again with a different pair of "glasses."</p>
<h3>Mei Lanfang to Bring Red Carpet on Train</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, Mei Lanfang has been residing in Hong Kong for several years. His wife, Ms. Fu Zhifang, only returned to Shanghai this summer. Mr. Mei was previously invited by gentry and merchants in Chongqing, Kunming, Guiyang, and other places to perform in charity shows to help those suffering from the winter cold. He has now reportedly agreed and is preparing to travel to the Southwest to perform as requested. This is provisionally recorded pending verification.</p>
<h3>Review of "The True Story of Ah Q"</h3>
<p>— Jin Ge</p>
<p>Ah Q, this typical character representing ignorance in feudal rural society, was deeply depicted by Mr. Lu Xun, who shouted loudly, both pitying Ah Q's unconscious sacrifice and hoping that the Ah Q within everyone's consciousness would die!</p>
<p>Ah Q has been dead for many years, and even Mr. Lu Xun, the one who depicted Ah Q, has passed away for five years. However, Ah Q's shadow, Ah Q's psychology, is still spreading throughout every social stratum. The feudal autocratic system has not been fundamentally destroyed; in some places, it has even become more deeply rooted. How many people like Ah Q are unknowingly and unconsciously sacrificed and devoured! Therefore, the revival of "The True Story of Ah Q" today is of profound significance.</p>
<p>This time, the fifth act is different from the original work by Chen Yu, the adapter. However, the entire play is most powerful precisely because of this different fifth act. The young master Qian and the old master Zhao use tricks and easily kill Ah Q, using a pretext that is so cunning. At the same time, it not only exposes the despicable intentions of the young master Qian but also highlights the selfish plans of the old master Zhao. The criticism of the faces of that group of people could not be more profound.</p>
<p>In addition, new techniques have been used in the set design, props, and lighting for this revival. In the final act, the director handles the crowd scene in a lively and vivid manner. The part where Ah Q dances before being paraded through the streets and suddenly realizes that his handcuffs have not been unlocked has the power to control the audience's emotions and move them.</p>
<h3>Random Notes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Cunren</p>
<p>The veteran actor and martial artist Shang Heyu was invited to the Golden Front Theater before, but the invitation did not materialize. Now, there are renewed discussions about inviting him. It is said that Li Shifang, the leading of the Four Little Famous Dan, and Xiao Changhua and others may arrive in Shanghai in February next year to perform at the theater, following Ma Lianliang and Li Yuru.</p>
<p>The two actors Wang Hongfu and Wang Yingwu were recently invited to the same stage, but Hongfu is being considered for retention by the Tianchan Theater, and Yingwu is being treated for an arm injury sustained during practice, so both are postponing their commitments.</p>
<p>Han Suqiu will no longer perform in troupes this year. It is said that someone is raising funds to rebuild a new theater in Suzhou, and they have invited Suqiu to perform there next spring.</p>
<p>Huang Guiqiu has been hired by a theater in Nanjing and will perform there after her current contract expires.</p>
<p>It is said that Guan Dayuan encountered danger on his way back this time. While passing through Xuzhou, several trains ahead of his were overturned. Although he was fortunate enough to escape unharmed, he was greatly frightened, which delayed his arrival in Shanghai by one day.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Yimingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 19: Dusk, Tartar Cavalry, City Covered in Dust</p>
<p>Seeing that Liu Zongmin and others could not defeat the Ming generals, and that his own side had lost Fan Damazi, Li Chuang could not help but be secretly alarmed. He thought that Wu Sangui's subordinates were all brave and skilled. Niu Quanxing said to Li Zicheng at the side: "Your Majesty, you see that Sangui's subordinates have many capable people. If we fight them today, we may suffer losses. Fortunately, we have more soldiers. Please order the entire army to attack, charge forward, and engage them in a melee. With our superior numbers, they will naturally be unable to resist." Li Zicheng also agreed with this idea, so he ordered the drums of advance to be sounded in the army again. The bandit rebels all moved forward together, horses galloping and soldiers running, filling the mountains and plains. They divided into several large groups and charged towards Sangui's formation. In an instant, Zhang Cangqiu, Xu Jing, and others were surrounded by the bandit rebels. Sangui also led his troops to meet the enemy, and the two sides engaged in a chaotic battle. The number of bandit rebels only continued to increase, and their momentum was great. On the Qing army's side, the Regent Prince Dorgon, along with Ajige, Dodo, Hong Chengchou, Kong Youde, Shang Kexi, and others, all stood on horseback on a high hill, watching the battle. Initially, they saw the Ming generals under Wu Sangui's command continuously斩kill several贼bandits, their attacks were fierce, and they were greatly amazed. Later, they saw the bandit rebels using their superior numbers to open their wings and surround the Ming army, like a tidal wave. The Ming soldiers fought fiercely, charging and grappling, and the sound of shouting and killing shook the sea. The time was already approaching noon, dust and sand rose from the mountains, raging like thunder. Both sides suffered heavy casualties, and the corpses piled up like mountains. Dorgon turned to look at Dodo and said: "Now we can go out and defeat the bandits." He ordered the cavalry of the Solon tribe to charge first. The warriors of the Solon tribe were the bravest troops among the Manchu tribes, skilled in horsemanship, and especially proficient in firearms and bows and arrows. In every battle, the Qing army assigned the Solon tribe the responsibility of capturing strongholds, and they could be called elite. At that time, the sound of drums shook greatly, and the Qing army suddenly emerged from the right of Sangui's formation. Ten thousand horses galloped, flying arrows fell like rain, and the firearms sounded loudly, like thunder. Wherever they went, nothing could stand against them.</p>
