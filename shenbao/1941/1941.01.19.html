<h3>世界局勢瞬息萬變　美採戒備實屬必要　海陸兩長促授總統全權　羅斯福不贊成限制建議　亦無修改租軍步驟意圖</h3>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統昨在招待記者席上稱、「援助民治國法案」中、有數項規定、係特爲保護美國而設、父稱、世界在二十四小時內、變動如是之速、使其本人毫無修改該項步驟之意圖、總統繼對一般人所稱、該案使渠擁有權力在英國戰敗時收買其艦隊之語、指爲「母牛跳過月亮」之投機心理、渠更進一步指斥反動該法案之人十稱、該法案並不規定不許總統倒行逆施、惟美國總統固亦無意倒行逆施也、渠復稱、關於出售美國海軍之事，不然、羅斯福氏繼重行證明前駐英大使甘納第氏有於今晚向全國作祖白廣播之權、惟　廿納第氏之演詞、最好俟渠對法案成立一種眞正的見解之後始行發表、總統對東京「朝日新聞」及其他日文報紙所稱、美國艦隊撤出夏威夷之記載、加以批評、認爲乃係又一「日報之新聞」云、（十八日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統昨招待新聞記者、聲明渠不贊成對於租借案加以限制之建議、並發幽默之言謂、如果揷人限制條文、則亦當另揷入一條、以防美總統根據此案而倒立云、叉調在此世事瞬息萬變之時、時局容有變化、而戒備實爲必要、租借案中准許海陸軍部爲友邦購置戰具一條之揷入、僅爲戒備辦法耳云、記者又以海陸軍要人皆進言、認總統援英政策爲錯誤及日本向本國建議召回夏威夷美艦隊兩說、目睹總統、據答稱、前者為義國報紙之消息、後者乃日本報紙之傳說云、記者復問近來會否接到英國方面關於亟待援助事之文件、總統答無之、記者最後詢以前任日內瓦國際勞工局理事最南特、將被選充駐英大使、以代廿納第一說、總統答稱、此說非由接近白宮之方面傳出者、（十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　此問政治活動、現集中於援英案、海長諾克斯（一九三六年大選時共和黨候選副總統）、對衆院外委會發言、贊助此案至爲有力、歷來美政府任何大員所發之言論、殆從未有如此决諾克斯所言之直率者、除將軸心國聯合艦隊與美艦隊之實力作驚人之比較、以表示目前及今後數年內軸心國海軍超過美國之優勢外、諾克斯並以堅決語調必明、萬一德勝英敗、則美洲定受其殃、同時參院孤立派領袖韋勒起而抨擊此案、要求發表駐英大使甘納第與駐法大使布立特戰前致美政府之報吿、而羅斯福總統亦親自出馬、參加舌戰、在新聞記者招待席上、駁斥此案以大權授予總統將危及國家之說、陸長史汀生昨續向衆院外委會陳述意見、聲明美國總統從未有貿然置國家於戰爭中者、國會儘可放心、以此案所提議之廣大責任託諸總統、而任令總統酌定何國應得美國之援助、（十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　海長諾克斯、陸長史汀生昨日同時警告稱、英國將在六十至九十日之內、遭遇危機、並敦促國會授羅斯福總統以重大權力、執行租賃法案、以援助英國、海陸兩長係在衆院外委會討論該案時、相繼發言者、二氏均不反對共和黨所提出將總統權力之時效、限於兩年之建議、惟皆附和國務卿赫爾星期三日所發表之言論、反對再事作其他之限制、海長稱、英國之危機、或將爲敵人於發動眞正侵略時、以潛艇及空軍互相配合、猛烈進攻之結果云、（十八日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　美國總工會會長格林、電致紐的州共和黨衆議員費施、略謂、租借案若干細則或須修正、惟依渠意見、此案原則應成法律云、按費施乃反對租借案者之一、（十八日路透社電）</p>

<p>孟買　印度國民大會黨各報、頃申斥「日本解放東南亞洲各國聯盟」之程序、自由日報稱」沉醉於驕傲中之日本、刻正强作仁愛之態、矚目於亞洲南部與東部、惟日本歷來如何對待鄰國耶、先則霸佔朝鮮與中國東三省、今且佔領中國本部、可見日本所謂拯救他人、實即統制及開拓他國之謂也、過去三十年來、日本所作所為、皆屬不友好行爲、致該國被海外各國所深爲不滿、日本之侵略東三省、實肇目下戰亂之端（十八日路透社電）</p>
<h3>羅斯福總統　明日就職　朱家驊電賀</h3>
<p>華盛頓　下星期一日羅斯福總統乘車由費城蔭道馳至國會之時、將有一種美國史中空前之儀式、呈現於民衆之前、因總統宣誓就第三屆連什、爲前所未有也、現有數千人民已來此準備參觀、據羅總統之侍醫語人、目前總統之體况及健康、可謂近數年來之最佳者（十八日路透電）</p>

<h3>美財部撥款　五千萬金　供中英阿三國　用於平衡幣值</h3>
<p>華盛頓　昨日發表之聯邦準備銀行報吿稱、美財政部已將五千萬元之款、供英國中國及阿根廷取用、以平衡其幣値、因中國及阿根廷漸提取此款、將來各銀行存於聯邦銀行之逾額準備金尙須增加、（十八日合衆社電）</p>

<p>波斯頓　澳州駐美公使凱賽、今日在此演說、謂美國如不幸而從事太平洋戰爭、則澳州願盡實與美合作、澳洲處太平洋之對面、有廣　之區域、其人民皆壯健而友善、飽受訓練、能供給所需風火與武器之大部分、凡此種種采可予以忽視、（十八日路透社電）</p>
<h3>諾克斯籲請　對英充分援助</h3>
<p>保持英美之聯合海權　遏阻德國侵入南美洲</p>
<p>華盛頓　海軍部長諾克斯上校、昨在衆院外委會發表關於援助民主國家之意見時、主張對英充分援助、以遏德國之侵入南美洲、諾克斯稱、倘英國之海上力量一旦消滅、德國將轉移其注意力於攫取南美之天然富源、渠宣稱、苟德國獲得餘暇通過大洋、征服新領土、首先必將侵入南美洲、奪取該處國家富源之大倉康、設美國不願遭遇在南美成立侵略軍力所產生之後果、則吾人目前應阻止德國擊潰英國之海軍力量、因央國頃方在歐洲與納粹搏鬥也、誇詡海上實力對吾國及全部西半球之重要、乃屬不可能者、良以英國及吾國之海上力量的存仟、大西洋與太平洋始　成爲遏阻侵略國家貪求無饜之　響之屏障、歐洲應視爲係獨裁者之企圖獨霸歐洲以至全世界之大部份的一大階段、納粹政權業已感受其軍隊本身之力量不能成立霸權、因歐洲之原料不足自給、而納粹軍隊未能控制海洋之時、亦無力獲得此種原料、大不列顚自昔即未嘗能自身支援其力足征服歐之之軍隊、英國乃各靠海權之控制以維持生存者、目下所進行之爭鬥、根本上即係　國企圖奪取中國之海洋控制、而前進的發展不受阻礙、然作相信、海權一旦入於德國之手、則情形定必殊異、（十八日合眾社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　美海長諾克斯向衆院外委會遞出海軍實力之數字、以證明美國艦隊還不足以匹敵各軸心國之聯合海軍、其中有一表、載美國已建之戰艦總數爲一·二五〇·〇〇〇噸、德·義兩國已建之總數爲八五〇·〇〇〇噸、但加以日本之艦隊、則爲一·八三五·〇〇〇噸、再加法國之艦隊、則爲二·一四五·〇〇〇噸、諾克斯又吿外交委員會、美海軍固爲世界最强大者、但如英國戰敗、則德國將擁有歐洲造船廠、其造艦能力及速度七倍於美國云、（十八日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　海長諾克斯於籲請國會通過租借案時謂、今後三年中之數字表示軸心國艦隊自主力艦以至潛艇、無一不駕　艦隊而上之、雖美國或可使今後兩年內所造之新艦百艘加入艦隊、惟同時軸心國艦隊將有三百艘新艦興四新隊之擴充、預料軸心國軍艦之增加最多者當爲潛艇、一九四二年一月間、美國可有軍艦三百四十二艘、而軸心國則可得八百零三艘、迨至一九四三年一月、美國艦隊將有四百二十二艘、而軸心國則共有九百六十二艘、今大西洋與太平洋之得爲障碍物、以阻遏侵略國之鯨呑計盡者、實英·美之聯合海權有以致之、而美國之能在過去十五年中維持其門羅主義者、亦實為英國之策應、美國以其資源旣可爲英國之助、亦可爲自己之準備、吾人今所須付之代價、固爲金錢力量與犧牲、但若吾人袖手旁觀、坐視英國傾覆、則不久吾人所須付之代價、定遠甚於此、此决戰爭在根本上乃德國奪取英國海權之嘗試、自上决大戰以還、美國僅在太平洋維持一海洋海軍、其所以能應付兩海洋者、端賴英國海軍之存在與發展、使吾人對大西洋得高枕無憂也、以實際言、英、美有兩海洋海軍、彼此合作、而以維持和平爲專務、獨裁國欲伸其支配權於世界。大部份、蓄謀已久、今之歐戰不過爲其最近之嘗試耳、美國覺有發展强盛海軍之必要、僅在過去五十年中爲然、德國旣大造海軍、以圖侵略遠地、而日本復向其國界外之和平國家擴張勞力、環境若斯、實使美國不得不有强盛海軍、美國人民苟欲使戰禍不發生於美國土地之上、則須準備其武裝、茍英國與其海軍安然存在、則美國人民方可從容準備、而仍能維持其世界各處之利益、渠確信英國等以吾人不稍退縮之援助定能處於不敗之地、故一方面儘速增强吾人海權、一方面以種種方法援助英國、使其安渡難關、此乃最有益於國家之辦法、（十八日路透社電）</p>
<h3>史汀生主張家　派艦駛入戰區</h3>
<p>在眾院答反對派質問　租借案不致導美參戰</p>
<p>華盛頓　陸長史汀生上校、昨於第二日蒞臨衆院作證時稱、渠反對不許美國海軍向戰區開駛之建議、氏云、無人能預知時局將有若何有關吾國國防之事件發生、屆時吾人或將遣派戰艦駛入戰區之必要也、余不信在任何情形之下、吾國應自行將右手反縛於背、反對該法案量力之丁克罕氏當即發問、「即使意在避免戰爭、亦不應如是乎」、陸長答「余信此舉無疑地將令吾人進入戰爭、或令吾人在最不利之情形下、受人攻擊、余主張美國無論在何種情形之下、均應保持其準備應變之狀態」陸長並對委會不准夫國軍艦擔任運輸工作之建議、表示反對、渠並稱、「余贊成原有之法案、一切之修改、均是處於非常時期中之國家以相當之阻碍」、史汀生上校答丁罕氏之質問、歷五十分錡之久、其决由瑪薩丹共和黨衆議員羅吉安夫人提出質問、間該法案是吾將授權總統、可隨意將海軍、商輸或祖克車、派至外國、陸長答稱、「顯然地總統將有權出此、惟如有認爲總統將利用之以將海軍售予外人、則屬人誤」、羅吉士夫人問、該法案亦將促使美國採取一種「在世界擔任警察工作」之政策吾？陸長答、「吾、余意與此相反、余不願美國參戰、一若汝等、余所以贊成總統之法案者、因余以爲可使吾國獲得更火之安全也」、陸長稱、渠對國防程序之進行、極不滿意、俄亥俄州共和黨衆議員伏雷氏問、「吾人在切實執行該程序之前、亦應先行成立一項協定、藉以規定英國艦隊之地位吾？」氏答、「此問題去夏已會加以審愼之考慮、吾人曾要求保證、旋即由某一民治國家將此項保證給予吾人矣」、陸長此語、係指英國對美保證謂、英國艦隊無論在何種局面之下、均不致向敵人投降、陸長又稱、「在戰爭中、並無任何不可能之事、此余所以極力主張應援助英國、勿使瀕於屈服、以免其破壞法紀也」、（十八日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　陸長史汀生對衆院外委會稱、渠對於兩個月或三個月時間內發生變局之可能、不無憂慮云、史汀生答某外委之問話、謂租借案不致導美國入戰局、某外委父問、此案所規定之援助、是吾爲防免英國失敗所必要、史汀生答日、「以余思之、殆甚必要」、民主黨某外委問、「遲早間如英國失敗、則吾人將以吾人之公債與人力作戰、此豈汝之見解乎」史汀生答曰、「此乃余個人見解一、或建議此案提議　予總統之大權應賦予一委員會、史汀生反對之、認爲危險、惟謂如對於總統行使此權之時期限爲一年、則渠並不反對云、（十八日路透社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>日暮途遠的軸心攻勢</h3>
<p>日來美國國會正在熱烈辯論民治國援助法案，倘能順利通過，中英希三國旣同爲援助對象，必然很快地自美國取得空前龐大的軍備接濟，足以一舉而打破目下歐亞兩組戰事的膠着狀態。這當然是一髮千鈞的重大關頭，料想德義日三國當周此時的心境，必和「待決之囚」差不多，一方焦慮着厄運的來臨，一方却又希圖僥倖於萬一；因此預料在援助法案成立的前後，同盟國方面必然還有一番最後挣扎。就中日本義大利兩國都處於配角地位，一切等待德國的勝敗來決定自己的命運；義大利每戰皆北，招架未遑，不復有還手的能力，自不必說；日本做足了南進的姿態，却也要希特勒發動攻勢，取得了優勢，在大西洋與地中海及巴爾幹方面，替日本牽制住了民治國力量，緩和了他在南太平洋上所將遭遇的阻力，然後發動這最後最冒險的嘗試。東西關鍵在此，故本文所欲檢討的，注重於德國未來的動作，允其是在巴爾幹方面的攻勢。</p>
<p>前些日子，德軍開入保加利亞的消息，鬧得滿城風雨，但結果蘇聯聲明「旣不知悉又未同意」於前，保加利亞復正式吾認於後，姑不問其是否事出有因，總之沒有實現。大抵德軍開入羅馬尼亞之後，僅進至多瑙河岸爲止，並未渡河入保，這是眞的，希特勒對於參加巴爾幹戰事，雖極盡盤馬彎弓之能事，但頗有瞻前顧後，進退徬徨之槪，此其理由、不是因爲目前無此需要、定是因爲前途阻力尙多，所以不得不再三拖延。第一，所謂「無此需要」，並非說希特勒甘願放棄巴爾幹；事實正相反，他爲對抗英國的封鎖計，必須把巴爾幹化成一個大兵站，大倉庫；不過他所需要的，是一個和平的生產的巴爾幹，而不是兵荒馬亂，殘破不堪的巴爾幹。據戰前一九三八年的統計，德國的對外貿易，一半以上在歐洲，而歐洲各國之中，允以巴爾幹各國的比數爲最大，例如保加利亞對德輸出佔總輸出百分之五八·九，對德輸入佔總輸入百分之五一·九，南斯拉夫輸出佔百分之三五。九，輸入佔百分之三二·五，羅馬尼亞輸出佔百分之二六·五，輸入佔百分之三六·九·希臘輸出佔百分之三八·五，輸入佔百分之二八·八；戰前尙且如此，戰後在英國實施封鎖，海外貿易幾乎完全斷絕的今日，爲數當然更鉅。所以就德國的立塲言之，祇要英國一日不能在巴爾幹方面威脅德國的優勢地位，則希特勒儘可暫時按兵不動，俾一方加緊經濟上的榨取，一方鞏固軍事上的控制，從而實現「兵站」「倉庫」的理想。當然，這種政策必須以義希戰事繼續膠着爲前提，萬一義大利軍隊完全失敗，無法在阿爾巴尼亞境內立足，則英國在希臘與土耳其二國協助之下，不難在東南歐洲方面廣事號召，以發動一個反軸心的巴爾幹集團，彼時德國在東綫的地位旣有全部崩潰的可能，當然不能坐以待斃。</p>
<p>第二，所謂「阻力尙多」，是指第三國的反對而言，例如上文所引蘇聯對於德軍入保一說所發表的聲明，似甚平淡，實極冷酷，而出之於德蘇簽訂經濟割界等協定墨瀋未乾之日，允使柏林人士哭笑不得。本來，蘇聯對於巴爾幹的和戰問題，是不能漠不關心的；對於斯拉夫種的保加利亞國，當然更不能聽任德國隨意擺佈；說者謂莫洛托夫於去年十一月間聘問柏林，其目的即在持績兩國間的經濟關係，但以德國不揷足巴爾幹爲前提；此說雖無從査究其是吾眞實，但按之近事，確有幾分近似。除去蘇聯之外，土耳其的態度也是希特勒必須顧及的因素之一；在前幾天盛傳德軍入保的時候，土國官方發言人居然明白表示，德軍若果入保，十國即當宣戰，這是第一個警告；緊接着英國近東軍事當局又連袂聘問土國，與該國參謀部進行秘密談話，據說是討論德軍萬一南下時英土兩國如何實行聯防計劃，這分明是第二個警告。</p>
<p>綜上觀之，可知希特勒雖然必須仕美國援助法案成立之後實際運用之前，發動最後攻勢，但以其環境情勢而論，似乎還不願而且也不敢立即在巴爾幹方面直接參加戰事；假使他果眞不顧一切，悍然假道保加利亞，以進攻希臘，那必定是因爲感覺到危機的急迫，而不得不出此「下策」。至於目前，他殆將仍以空襲爲主耍作戰，俾一方轟炸英倫本部，一方利用他在義大利南部西西里島所新得的根據地，以威脅地中海上的英國艦隊和商船，然後等待時機成熟，再在各綫發動他最後的「冬末攻勢」或「春季攻勢」。</p>

<p>美會努力　覓致和平</p>
<p>余將簡陳於諸君之前者、乃關於危險已如何駕臨此平球之重要事實、及本國必須起而促成應付此種危險之準備、在過去八年中、我國政府曾努力使用其所有之各種和平方法以期建樹一種情狀、使世界得一繼續和平之合理希望、吾人堅信唯有此種情狀、可使吾國確受保障而安享和平、此種情狀之建立、必須各國接受並適用某種國際間和平友好的行爲與關係之基原本原則、因此我國政府處理國際關係時、曾致力於達到下列各目標、（一）美國之和平與安全、而確係五國以和平與限制及裁减軍備爲目標、（二）爲法律、秩序、正義、道德及自由原則、（三）根據平等待遇、恢復並增進健全之經濟協定及關係、（四）在提倡此項目標中、充量發展國際合作之實用方法、（五）增進西半球之安全、團結及一般福利、遵守並擁護此項政策之基本原則及努力、促進其接受及適用、現更日趨重要、因有三個國家、已相繼以言動表明其決心放棄及毀壞法治下之文明世界、而踏進武力征服他國、並苛治其人民之途徑、此可怕的趨向之初步、在一九三一年發生於遠東、即遠反九國公的及非戰公的、而以武力侵佔滿洲是也、</p>
<p>痛斥日本　武力侵華</p>
<p>一九二一—二年華府會議所建立之遠東均勢，乃因用武力在中國一部設立日本統治之滿洲國而大受動搖、滿洲之受日本統治、其最　著者、乃實行一歧視政策、結果美國及他國之利益均被排擠、决年日本積極作以武力求伸張之準備、一九三四年十二月、日本表示欲終止一九二二年二月六日之海軍公的、繼乃進而加緊製造海陸軍備，並常常作擴張其在中國之統治之一定行動、不顧且毀壞美國及他國之合法權利、一九三七年七月、日本軍隊開始對中國作大規模之軍事行動、超越百萬之侵略軍隊、佔領沿海及中部各省之廣大區域、在佔領區域內建立傀儡統治、而實施統制專利之岐視制度、以謀侵略國之利益、日本自始即抱野心之廣大計劃、意圖達到統治太平洋西部之位置、此乃完全明顯者、日本領袖曾公開宣稱、決以武力達到並維持共位置、而成爲擁有世界人口之一半地城之主宰、結果日本將對該地域內之航海及商業交汕得任意管制、過去之經騐及現在之發展、昭吿吾人、所謂太平洋地帶之新秩序者、即出一國作政治上之統治而已、從經濟上言之、即該地帶之一切富源、由該國獨享、結果使該地帶之他郁貧乏、而他國之利益亦被排出、從社會上言之、則個人自中被　滅、而被征服之人民將渝居决等地位、任何人皆應明瞭此種征服世界人口幾及一半之程序乃一極重要之事件、對於具他不論處於何地之國家、皆有重大關係、日本在近年雖採此種途徑、但美國政府曾屢屢勸吿日本政府　謂其最佳之利益、乃在於美國及其他國家建立友好關係、而美國及他國乃信任國際秩序及和平者、吾人並未作任何恐嚇。</p>
<p>義在歐洲　破壞秩序</p>
<p>在歐洲方面首决破壞世界秩序者、乃義犬利、在一九三五年該國侵佔阿比西尼亞、直接違反國聯盟的上之莊嚴義務及非戰公的一九三九年義國違反肯定之條的義務攫取阿爾巴尼亞、一九四〇年夏、義國袒德參加歐戰、明白宣稱、助德之目的、乃欲根據建立在無限使用武力之新秩序、以變更世界現狀、最後無故攻擊希臘、在此時期中、美政府向義政府表明、美國對於國際間和平關係之日趨腐壞、極爲關切、在義阿戰爭時及義大利參加歐戰之前、美政府屢向義政府通知、冀能防止世界秩序再受破壞、德國於希特勒及共同僚在一九三三年得勢後、即開始瘋狂的建造鉅大軍備、一方面常以出爾反爾之外交把戲打銷他國之懷疑、在日內瓦軍縮會議數月之時期、施行其特著之得寸進尺策略後、德國終於在一九三三年十月退出軍縮會議、使國際之限制軍備協定、無由吿成、此後六年、德旣決定無限征略之政策、即向戰爭之途邁進、德國之準備工作、可分爲兩大部分、第一部分係建造武力、爲達到此項目的、共全部國民經濟、已變成極度統制、極有紀律之戰爭經濟、其每種經濟活動、均係備戰所必需、其全國之稅收、大半用於軍事目的、外國貿易及外國支付、亦因同一目的而受嚴格統制、飛機·坦克車大砲及其他所有構成現代戰爭機構之附屬品之生產、成為全國人民努力之緊要目的、</p>
<p>德人一再　違反諾言</p>
<p>第二部工作、係包括種種改進德國戰略地位所必需之步驟、其中第一步爲一九三六年直接撕毀羅迦諾條的、佔領萊因區及在該地設防、繼此以後、則爲希特勒直接違反其所爲尊重奥大利主權與獨立之諾言、而兼併奥國、兼併奥國以後、希特勒叉曾爲保證、謂德國於歐洲、再無領土要求、然未幾又違反其一九三八年所公然表示尊重捷克斯拉夫獨立之諾言、而分割及佔領捷克、此後則又爲兼併米美爾之舉、最後於一九三九年九月一日、竟對波蘭施行凶猛之攻擊、而將其分割、戰爭時期又侵犯丹麥、挪威、荷蘭、比利時及盧森堡所跋格遵守之中立、違犯其對以上若干國家所予尊重共主權與獨立之保障、而侵略此等國家、侵略丹、挪等國後、則叉有侵略及部分佔領法國、分裂羅馬尼亞而佔領該國一部分之事、德人此種侵佔、係同時採川武力攻擊及破壞活動兩種手段、內外夾攻、雙管齊下而成、每一被侵略、故占領之國家、均不免遭逢恐怖時代及絕對主義之危險、侵略者由共言詞及手段、顯已決心將此等不幸國家永久置於暴政之下、美國政府在猶存一綫希望、欲使德國領袖停止其所循之策略之時、對於所逢之機會、絕未疏忽、美國曾」再於經濟調整上貢獻其協助、以冀用和平手段解決當時之困難、然所有　等希望、已均隨納粹軍隊進攻波蘭及於歐洲發動一新戰爭而付諸流水自是時起、人類所面臨者、非爲一種局部之戰爭、而爲一有組織的、無理性的及仇恨的廣大征服行動、吾人當前、今已有種種之勢力、此等勢力係不受法律秩序及道德原則之限制、其侵略之程序、亦無限度、此等勢力、現已蔓延陸地之大部分、並將控制海洋、藉以成就及維持其征服另一大陸之目的（未完明日續</p>

<h3>英法陣线零亂回憶</h3>
<p>這是法國文學家莫樂所著「法蘭西的悲劇」一書中的另一章，茲譯錄如下：</p>
<p>一九四〇年五月初，余赴前綫參觀法國柯蘭普將軍所指揮的第七路軍，數日後，首被德軍擊潰的就是這一軍。該軍總司令部設在凡爾溫小村。凡爾溫是舊式市鎭街道冷落，百葉窗半閉，官兵們在粗糙的石子路上行走，聽那皮靴棄棄之聲，顯見他們態度從容，猶如公務員在太平時節按鐘點上衙鬥辦公一般。</p>
<p>我到達該鎭的當晚，即寫信給內人說，「我在這個地方，遇到不少忠良之士，可是他們似乎太守舊，太頑固了…」</p>
<p>柯蘭普將軍秉性懦怯，沒有糾糾武夫的氣槪。而且大腹便便，　綁腿，入車廂，也覺困難。他雖然談笑風生，但總使人覺得太注意往事。</p>
<p>我視察福爾邁和却利維郊外駐軍，見守望稀疏，兵士寥落，非常驚異。回到凡爾溫時，一路行來，如入無人之境。汽車經過一村又一村，村中毫無防禦，不禁使我想到敵軍一且突破邊防，即可長驅而入。市鎮入口，佈置着孩子也推得倒的木製鐵絲網，障礙物，一個上刺刀的哨兵，和一個警官，唯此而已！要阻止敵軍裝甲部隊，眞無異痴人說夢。</p>
<p>其實在波蘭戰役中，早已顯出英法軍隊的配備，絕不足以應付現代戰爭，甚至對於任何戰爭的普通須要，亦相去很遠哩。</p>
<p>我軍是怎樣佈防呢？總司令部因爲要防守漫長的邊境，把兵力分布在鄧扣克到門登這一段，不啻一條狹長的帶子。這種横錢配備，還是一九一四年第一决歐戰時傳下來的禦敵方法。當時因爲敵人沒有充分兵力，足以突破法軍陣綫，故能堅守不退，然而歷來善於用兵的人，都認防綫延長，兵力分散，是一件非常危險的事。他們一致贊成用縱深配備法，允主張留置大量流動性的後備兵力，萬一第一道防終被突破，亦可立即起而反攻，堵塞缺口。</p>
<p>但是一九四〇年的法國，官兵員額異常缺乏，所謂流動後備隊，實際上可說一無所有。法軍的精銳，巳全數駝在邊防。假使敵人果能突破防錢即可長驅直入，勢如破竹。敵軍前進時，當然要經過無數村莊，但還有誰來防禦抵抗呢？一九一四年的戰爭，攻軍前進甚綏，每日至多數公里，且因陣綫突出而易受攻擊。這種正面進攻的觀念，已經深入人心，所以從沒有人設想到如何防禦杜華，凡爾溫，阿勃維爾，或亞眠。</p>
<p>負責防衛這許多地方的將校，雖身臨前敵，但仍是和藹可親，不愧長者風度。他們解甲已久，一旦戰爭爆發，雖令重掌兵符，亦不過認爲備員而已。像這班忠實的官僚，雖然熟讀兵書，可是對於裝置機關槍的敵軍戰車或機械化部隊機關來攻，屆時果將如何應付，他們殆從未夢想到吧！</p>
<p>這些村鎭，恰在陣綫後方，且有鐵路聯絡，正是法軍的「交通綫」，因此形勢更爲嚴重·英軍可由亞眠，阿拉斯，杜華，列黎的鐵路綫獲得接濟，緊急時更可利用阿勃維爾至波洛業一綫。但是這兩條路綫一經切斷，前方軍隊，即不免與根據地完全隔絕。法軍糧食，配備，軍需的儲藏庫，設在勒哈佛，沙屈利，南得等地，共前進軍需站則在阿勃維爾，聖保羅和阿拉斯。假使敵軍突破前綫，破壞軍隊和軍站的交通，便將怎樣？顯然不出數日，必至彈盡糧絕，束手成擒。究竟總司令部對於這種危險，有何戒備？對於防禦不由正面而由側翼的攻擊，有何措置？乾脆地說一句，竟是絲毫沒有。</p>
<p>假使英法決心孤注一擲，把兩國命運付與前綫將士，那末這條防綫，必須不惜犧牲堅守到底。縱不甚堅强，究還有着一道防綫，三四兩月中從英國携來的龐大挖泥機，曾在英軍前綫作挖掘戰車陷阱的工作比較一九三九年十月中的情形，已不可同日而語。可是這八個月辛苦經營所築成的防舍，堡壘，敵軍甫經發動，即便棄之如遺，不惜冒險以作野戰，這豈不是天下最蠢的事？</p>
<p>我曾聽過甘茂林說，「這决戰爭中，第一個空壁而出的，必蒙較大的危險……」所以他這種不幸的出擊，或是政治上的理由使然，而並不是出於他的本意。此舉當然準備得很久。我見總參謀部在九個月中，運籌帷幄，缜密硏究如何「進兵比利時」小心擬定前進的命令，希望在比王乞援之時能佔五分鐘的先著。他們算計比利時的批抗，可使聯軍及時佔據安特衛普至那摩爾一綫。吉勞特一軍目將突進至勃萊達。可是德國對於侵比時聯軍的對抗行動，早已瞭如指掌，我們於不知不覺中，已在他們目光所及之處，實地演習過一次了</p>
<p>事實是這樣的。有一天，一架德國飛機突在比境降落。飛機中載着德國總參謀部人員，携有在某日進兵比利時的全部計劃。機中人佯作驚惶，欲將文件付之一炬，却又故意稽延時刻，使寫我軍所得。於是英軍立即紛紛作備，由三號，而二號，而一號，這最後命令就是準備在兩小時內進發。大軍開始行動，所有後備隊都開抵前綫。德國偵察機臨空俯視，把所見的一一加以記錄。德軍參謀部見這種陳腐不堪，使人一望而知的戰略，居然能克奏膚功，一方面果然要樂不可支，一方面也要詫爲異事哩！</p>
<p>這時候德軍自然按兵不動，比利時也自然沒有乞援，因此，我們的大軍枉費了大量的汽油，仍退回原防。但是英國軍事情報部主任麥克法萊素悉德軍詭計，他在英國人中，對這决事件獨抱悲觀，他於德國的攻擊荷比，依然深信不疑。他說，「在愛克斯拉沙百勒一帶，仍有德軍一百十師，他們決不是無端駐在那裏的。」</p>
<p>五月十一日，英軍開入比利時，我亦隨行。在古色古香引人入勝的小市鎭中，在整潔的村莊中，挨門沿戶，都有婦女手捧鮮花，贈與兵士。有一英國戰地訪員，用忠實的筆調，描寫那種凱旋式的進兵，却被一封報館來電所警醒：「請少談鮮花，多供事實。」他服從這條命令，儘可母庸費心，因爲到了第二天，鮮花竟不復見，而事實已使他受到殘酷的打擊了。</p>
<p>比利時村莊中的婦女，依然沿戶站立，只是焦急地仰望天空。但是直到此時爲止，德國飛機的破壞尙屬不多，村中被毀的房屋，不過寥寥二三家而已。在我看來，這種轟炸是無足介意的。不料我却錯了。</p>
<p>（未完）</p>
<p>歐戰叢談（冊一）</p>
<h3>義大得戰敗的因果</h3>
<p>巴陀格里奥上將辭職後，其繼任，由聲望較决的加伐里羅將軍承乏，此人在上决歐戰結束時，曾出席凡雨賽和平會議，手組黑衫黨軍團，曾任陸軍部决長，和德國軍事常局往還甚密。</p>
<p>加伐里羅這時主持戎機，正當義國處境最艱難的時期，不僅阿爾巴尼亞方而戰局不利，即在其他各處前錢也多挫折。墨索里尼在去年五月參加戰爭時，對自己的海空軍實力，並沒有弄淸楚。其陸軍除佔領了東菲英屬索馬里蘭一塊不毛之地外，並無什麼戰績。格拉齋亞尼上將所統的軍隊駐紮在埃及邊境，原以進攻蘇彝士運河爲目標，現在也被英國海陸空軍節節擊敗了。</p>
<p>義國本部的食糧和油類，也受到英國海軍封鎖的影響，米和麵粉等物早已實行計口授糧制。當局並下令，凡農民拒絕把糧食存入公倉者，將受處罰。羅馬方面則人心惶惶，謠言蠭起。</p>
<p>從一九三九年九月一日希特勒進兵波蘭時起，直至一九四〇年十月二十八日義大利進兵希臘爲止，軸心國的每一種攻勢，無不馬到成功，使極權主義者的勢力，一時煊赫到無以復者。在義大利軍進攻希臘的時候，英國方面雖稱此爲「墨索里尼的失策」，義國當時未必理會，結果果然應騐了。</p>
<p>今年春間，德義兩國或將在近東方面採取新攻勢，但巴雨幹各國，如南斯拉夫和保加利亞，已決意不受軸心國的覊絆，土耳其也已準備抵抗侵略，加之巴爾幹半島的犬時地理都不適宜於大規模戰爭。公路的不整齊，鐵路的絕無僅有，崇山峻嶺的障礙，都不適於機械化戰爭，德國上决歐戰中早已熟悉了。（完）</p>

<h3>紗花　紗市欲小又止</h3>
<p>紗市始疲繼回、但趨勢復人飄盪不定中、塲上人心高低不一、惟探聽下來、還是多數看昂、不過實際交易、異常缺乏、二十支雙馬現貨價廉於廠單每包爲五十元外、然外匯大衆看縮、金價要漲、對於棉紗亦屬望漲也、所以證券幫及金子幫拖進之額量、日見增加、市面益覺鞏固、一小即升也、二十支雙馬高價爲一千四百四十四元、低便爲一千四百二十五元、今日有棉紗六百三十五件運香港、</p>

<h3>細絨需要甚佳</h3>

<p>紐一約棉市、先因同業購進、繼因各方瓦有了結、故市况雖堅甚不均勻、結果較之上日收盤價格除現貨獨漲十二磅音外、其餘上下一二磅音不等、印棉見弱、昨日連同預測後小二羅比、</p>

<p>（一）多方意謂標金高價、掉期要　看漲、外滙要觀縮、於是不　顧一切紛紛出動而拖進、由　此一來、雙馬趨勢、扶搖直上　矣、</p>
<p>（二）空方說目下年頭歲尾、實際　銷路停滯、且內地對於囤貨　者嚴厲處制、蜀中紗價不振、　二則紗廠因原料廉宜、二十　支紗每件純益有二百元外、　所以在營業方針上着想、當　然紛紛開出遠期紗、查中英　兩廠在最近一旬中開出之額　量的計一萬五千包外、不過　多數在二三月期貨、接受者　目前已盈利、毫無問題也、</p>
<p>（三）查目下之紗市上下浩大、波　浪滔天、全係投機商踴躍之　故、漲跌之勢均劇、大概病根　還係游資充斥、兼之近來小　銀號新創者蓬勃、可以代客　收貨交貨、如斯更變幻多端　矣、（山）</p>

<h3>食米問題</h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>譯自大陸報</p>
<p>大陸報云，目前有一嚴重問題，爲當局所亟於抑制者，爲解除食米之恐慌也。商界中人，以爲當局若不能予以緊急措置，則新年過後，米價將見每担一百五十兀之最高峯也。此種預言，證諸過往情形，則並非危言聳聽。脫我人將逝別未久之一九四〇年加以回顧，則根據工部局工業科所統計者，一九三九年年底時，杜米及秈米之價，爲每担三十九元五角及三十六元八角。此一數字，較之一九三六年時，每担十兀者，增加三倍。在一九四〇年之初期，米價並不據漲，尙有樂觀成分。然衆價之上漲，實　使生活程度日高，數百萬居民遭遇嚴車問題，則爲必然。當四月中，米價最高每担爲四十一元，而秈米所漲亦不多，故市民亦尙未感恐慌也。乃一至初夏，反常之狀態立見，杜米之最高價達六十元，和四月份相較，竟漲百分之五十。此中原由，固不一而足。如：（一）時正靑黃不接，存底向例减少。（二）上海四周，米糧缺少。（三）產米區有人加緊收買，作爲軍用。（四）因日海軍之演習而法屬印度支那形勢突見緊張。（五）米蠢囤積。叶種情形，至十月中再見，每担最高價達七十元。至十月杪，因法幣之上漲而使　價略疲。乃十一月起，繼續高漲。允以十二月份爲甚。至年底時飹，杜米已近百元，而市民竟大半仰食洋米矣。除上述各要素外，米價之所以上漲，據云，尙有若干原因即。（一）日本在產米區統制米糧出口。（二）西貢米進口之加多困難。(三）囤積及奸商之操縱。</p>
<p>關於日本在產米區統別米糧出口，第一目的在救濟日本國內之米荒，而其次則在投機。在過去一年之中，究有若干米糧，運往日本，並無確實之統計。蓋所有被軍艦運往日木之米糧，海關常局無法顧問。然的略佔計，則一九四〇年運往日本之食米，至少有六百萬担。此一統計，乃根據產米區域一九四〇年所能生產者而來。運往上海之米，則不及此數。日本之商人，正與此間之華商及外商相同，善用敏銳之手法，從中投機，囤積米糧，冀圖厚利。國際方面皆知有日商兩家，幾將米業獨佔。彼等之投機操縱，不特使上海杜米日見缺少，且在佔領區內，限定食米售價，故一轉手間，獲利自倍也。</p>
<p>任何區域，日軍經佔領，即着手統制食糧。在過天三年之中，日商因統制米糧而所獲利潤，至少有一萬萬元。一九四〇年前，上海之米商，尙能向產米區直接糧米，益和日人發生關係後，可領到派司。但自日軍加緊統制之後，即不再簽發派司。而上海市上所見之杜米，唯一來源，乃爲冒險來去，不怕被捕危險之農民及小米商從中販運而已。安南局勢之緊張，使西貢米之運入日見困難，惟以事而言，在過去一年，米商進口之米，數量方面，並不减少，且見加多。是故若謂米價高漲，實因米糧缺乏，則此說殊難成立也。根據統計所得，照上年度最初十個月之情形，全年進口之洋米超過三百七十七萬溳，平均每月有三十一萬千担。單就十月份進口者達一百三十萬担。故一年之總數，可超過一九三九年全年所進口者八十萬担矣。</p>
<h3>粉市平淡</h3>
<p>現粉市况、趨勢尚稱平衡、查本客銷化、動而不暢、惟華廠平賣粉、供量祇合以前半數、且香港方面、來源不繼、前有香港運到之藍嘜粉等、餘剩不多、故人心似難看小、早市花烏牌澳粉做開三千餘包、價由二十四元五角鬆至四角、及藍嘜粉二十四兀三角至二角半、亦由本客辦去一千餘包、後市交易平淡、市面已入徘徊之局、華廠粉批出四千餘包、價仍爲二十一元五角、另加雜費每包　洋麵粉繼續來滬、太古公司瓊州輪、除裝來大批洋米外、並由香港運來洋麵粉六千八百包</p>
<p>小麥交易、仍居擯局、在供源缺乏期中、華廠與日廠均無現貨可收、兼之急景殘年、各業均備結束、故市塲雖有喊價、而乏正市、</p>

<p>香烟暗盤市情、連日又趨緊俏、因金融趨縮、一般投機者又活動、囤戶猛力吸收、紛向市塲搜羅、同業扳緊不賣、致價趨漲、昨如大英牌做一千三百二十五元、老刀脾九百六十五元、品海牌八百六十元、五華牌六百六十三元、小仙女牌六百五十五兀、十支大前門牌每萬支三百四十六元、五十大前門牌每萬技三百五十二元、市價均較上週趨榮、國烟市平、金鼠牌四百五十元、美麗牌七百元、照行盤升二十餘元、</p>
<h3>鹹肉年銷報漲</h3>

<h3>寒假作業</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>小朋友們！光陰是過得那麼快，轉眼之間，寒假又到了。雖然寒假是不比暑假，時間很短，但我們看到光陰的可貴，那麽這短短兩星期的寒假，似乎也應當充分的利用，不能在糊塗中混過。既然要利用假期，我們在這寒假的開頭，就要確定假期作業的計劃才好。依我個人所看到的，在寒假裏，關於假期作業，可這樣的做：</p>
<p>（一）寫作方面：每大寫一篇日記，我們知道寫日記，對於寫作的技巧方面，有很多益處。平常舉校裏本來有日記的，在寒假裏應繼續去寫。沒有的，就可利用寒假來寫日記。至於作文，也同樣要做，請老師或家長命題，自己能我題目當然也好；至少每星期寫一篇或兩篇，能够這樣，寒假的時間雖短，你在寫作上還是可得相當的進步。</p>
<p>（二）閱讀方面：平常我們因爲每天要上課，學校裹的功課又很忙，所以每是苦於沒有時間去閱讀比較有系統的長篇名著。但寒假就給予我們一個機會，依照你的程度，去選擇幾種長篇讀物，每天規定一二小時，在寒假中讀完，那也可幫助你在文學上的認識和進步。</p>
<p>（三）補習方面：如果你對某幾種功課，自己知道成績不大好，那你就切不可失掉這寒假的機會，應該把過去，學期的課本，細細溫習一遍。像算術，還要做習題，不懂可去問家長或朋友。這樣，你溫習了一個寒假，等到開學，就可跟得上別人了。否則，在寒假中不去溫習，非但毫無進步，而且要遺忘，下學期格外要落伍哩。關於這，該是大家可知道的吧！</p>
<h3>對童軍鼻祖貝登堡致敬</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>一度誤傳逝世的童軍鼻祖貝登堡氏，終於不幸的在根雅庽所去世了！噩耗自英京傳來，莫不對此古稀老人，痛悼致敬。本埠國際各級童子軍集團，已定於今日（星期日）下午三時，假江西路大禮拜堂，舉行追悼大會，由童軍指揮官戈登氏率領致祭，想今日臂圍黑紗的英武童軍隊，必有無窮的哀感吧。</p>
<p>攷英人貝登堡厄爾Baden-Powel於西歴一千九百〇七年始創童子軍Boy．Scouts採取軍隊之編制方法，以訓練兒童合羣，耐勞，急公；好義之習慣與知能。其後各國相繼仿辦。我國亦於民國四年間，成立中華全國童子軍協會。其組織以十二歲至二十歲之學生八人，或十二人爲一隊，二隊以上爲團，團以上則爲縣聯合會，及省聯合會。其敎授項目，分爲救急，消防，縫紉，烹飪，及乘馬，盪舟，露宿，淺近測量，製繪地圖，放語等等……記得當民八時，北京大學生打倒曹（汝霖）章（宗祥）陸（宗與）等的救國運動，吾錫童子軍全體出動站崗，維持社會秩序。（時全城廂罷市）雄糾糾。氣昂昂的勇武精神，猶留深刻的印象。我不得不格外敬佩貝登堡氏，創辦童軍有裨於世界各國的功績。茲於同聲追悼之日，謹對貝登堡氏，致其無限之崇敬。</p>
<h3>小問題</h3>
<p>— 草古</p>
<p>現在有大小不同的鐵釘若干枚，要求它的體積，問怎樣求法？所得的結果既耍準確而又須做起來較爲簡便的</p>
<p>假使用普通求體積的方法去求，那眞是笨極了，計算起來既麻煩，由所得的結果也不能得十二分的準確；因爲普通求體積的方法：都是底面積乘上了高，雖然對於一般簡單的物體，當然是足够應付了；但是遇到了像釘一類的物體，有凹有凸，有扁圓有三角，你若使也是這樣的把一只只的釘，一部部的去求了再一一地加將起來，豈小是麻煩得要頭痛嗎？况且它們的數値，又不會適巧是整數的，都是些不盡小數，以不盡小數乘不盡小數，所得的結果怎會準確呢？所以這個法子是不適用了。但是，聰明的小朋友！你能想出一個需要簡便和準確的方法嗎？現在這裹有了，且看下面吧：</p>
<p>拿一只杯子，盛滿了水，使齊至杯口，然後把听要求的釘放入杯內，杯內的水也因之溢出杯來，把所溢出的水，收集起來，用量管量之，所量得的數，即爲鐵釘的體積，若干立方纏或立方呎，（如若，以上做法，嫌溢出的水不易收集，則可用二只相同容量的杯子，一只內置鐵釘，另一只內滿盛了水，（須齊杯口）然後把此水倒人放釘的杯內，至齊口即停止，這樣量所剩餘在該杯內的水，所得的結果也一樣的。）這是什麽緣故呢？這些水的體積會等於鐵釘的體績：這因爲鐵釘入杯後，就把同體積的水擠溢杯　來，所以溢出的水的體積就是鐵釘的體積。假如現在有一杯子藍色水，適巧齊口，但是現在又要加一匙的紅色水進去，我們不是須要把藍色水預先拿掉一匙，然後紅色水加進杯去，不致使杯內的水溢出來，鐵釘也是這樣的，釘有多少體積，入水後，必須排出同體積的水來的，我們利用這個原理來求物體的體積，豈不簡便和準確嗎？</p>
<h3>小學生暑期作業競賽　初級第五名　我的父親</h3>
<p>— 粹光小學　左天林</p>
<p>我的父親，是大學裏的教授，他　中法文學，很受許多人的讃美；可是他的脾氣，很是固執，使人不能和他親近而畏却的。那時我的年紀尙小，父親也不常和我住在一起；所以一些也不懂什麼。後來由外祖母告訴我家裏的情形，才知道我的父親，曾在河南省河甫大學當敎授；道時我和母親住在一塊兒，有母親慈愛的敎養，感覺到的都是快樂。那知不久不幸的事情竟發生了，不知道在什麼時候，父親和一個法國婦女，發生了戀愛，竟拋棄我慈愛的母親，置生活於不顧，可憐的母親在這時一切的期望，完全消失了，因此悲傷過度，積愛成疾，一病不起，竟拋下我而長逝了。從此我是變成一個沒有受人慈愛而可憐的孩子，只得寄居在外祖母處，由外祖母的扶養，總算有衣有食，還沒有感覺到失掉母親的痛苦。</p>
<p>在七七事變的時候，父親帶了後母和一對雙生子回到故鄉（武昌）米，他和我一點都沒有父子情感，非但沒有情感，竟把我當做一個小奴婢；後來由親戚朋友的勸解，叫我進學校讀書，但是每學期的學費，都要經過苦苦的哀求，他才肯付出。</p>
<p>八一三事變發生的一年，我們就避難到上海來，他就在一個國立大學裏當敎授，收入還好，可是上海生活程度，日高一日，全家數口，都恃父親的收入支付，因此父親心裏非常愁悶。我日裹在鄰近的小學裏讀書，早晚中午放學回家，就幫着他們做事，每天的三餐，都由他們規定，分量不得多一米粒。生活程度增高，父親更氣惱了，下學期不給我繼續求學，並且還要送我到什麽收容所裹去，唉！我眞是一個苦命的孩子，好容易得到讀書的機會，讀了叫年，現在繼續求學，恐怕又危險了。</p>
<p>我很希望有什麼慈善家，能容我早晚做個小奴，幫助我升學，我就感激不盡了。我很奇怪，我愛我的父親，而我的父親竟拋棄我！</p>
<h3>朝氣</h3>
<p>— 沈錫身</p>
<p>大凡一個年紀很輕的人，總應該具有一種「朝氣」，小朋友們，你們知道「朝氣」兩字的意義嗎？這是說，在早晨的時候，一輪旭日，剛從東方昇起，這時的空氣是多麽淸新；一日之計在於晨」，所謂烏語花香，和風惠暢，萬物在這時都有欣欣向榮之象，這便是朝氣勃發；現在廣義的說起來，一個年紀輕的人，也正如一天中的淸晨一般，應該具有强健的體格，愉快的精神，以及一種樂觀的抱負，所以在他的外表上，也有一種欣欣向榮的朝氣勃發的神氣可以看出來，有了這種朝氣，無論去求學，去幹事，還怕不成功嗎？並且未來的希望，也正無限呢！</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們也具有這種朝氣嗎？這是每一個現代靑年所不可缺少的，假使你自覺還缺乏這種朝氣的要獲得他，那也不是一件十分困難的事情，祇須早起早睡，工作，遊玩，以至飲食都有一定的時間，不看無益的書報，不做毫無意義的事情，並且心中常存着一個快樂的觀念，這樣持之恒久，我相信一定能成爲一個朝氣勃發，振作有爲的人了。</p>
<h3>怎樣對付我們的敵人</h3>
<p>— 陳兆炳</p>
<p>近來我們小是時常聽到許多小朋友們被誘拐綁架的新聞嗎？甚至在同孚路有三位小朋友是被匪徒們撕票勒斃了。這是多麼殘酷可怕的事啊！的確，在這萬惡的孤島上，我們眞要自己刻刻留意；不然隨時都有發生意外的危險。</p>
<p>不過我們推其被誘拐綁架的原因，那不外乎是小朋友們家擁巨產及愛吃食玩的緣故。只耍有吃有玩，便貿然不問情由的隨他去了，因此匪徒們抓住了這個弱點，作爲　攻的武器，以前同孚路三位小朋友的慘死，便是一個很明顯的例證</p>
<p>那末我們怎樣才能使匪徒們無法下手呢？下面所寫着的不過是隨意想到的幾則罷了。</p>
<p>一、就是不要太愛吃和貪玩</p>
<p>二、散學後應該立刻回家，不要在路上逗遛。</p>
<p>三、細心辨別正在向你說話的人是好是歹。</p>
<p>四、如已發覺對方爲奸徒，那你應該用鎮靜機警、不畏懼的態度，想種種方法使他沒有脫逃的機會：如報告附沂的警務員與行路的成人。</p>
<p>五、同學間應相互幫助，如護送幼小的同學等，並須相互監視着正在向着一個同學問話人的舉動。</p>
<p>如果小朋友們能照我上面的話行去，那我想至少能防止除暴力以外的許多不幸事件。</p>

<h3>「綠寶」的「家」</h3>
<p>— 田衣</p>
<p>關於巴金底「家」的搬上舞台，已引起了「綠賣」與「劇藝社」的爭執，這裹所寫的正就是「搬」「家」事件一方面，綠寳劇塲的「家」，是由「嘉其」改編的。</p>
<p>這齣「家」編成五幕。第一幕的地點是「高家」的「客廳一，第二幕的地點是「高家」的「書房」，第三幕的地點是「覺民」「覺慧」兄弟的「臥室」，第四幕的地點又是「高家」的「客廳」，第五幕的地點則是「覺新」的「房間」。舞台上的氣氛不必談，裝置道具等頗多偷懶的地方。「客廳」和「書房」當然比較是最好，覺民覺新的「臥室」可就有商榷的必要。那個時候的「成都」，那樣的一個「大家」，傢具會是這樣嗎？允其是覺新的房間，我們知道覺新的房間該是個有妻子的房間，該是有許多陳設的「房問」，即使爲了省事起見，床總必須是「大牀」，決不可以「小鋼床」來代替的</p>
<p>關於演出，演員支配也欠考量。因爲覺民不過是一個十九歲的靑年，而舞台上田曉靑那付「老氣橫秋」的樣子怎可以應付？因爲覺民變「大」了，於是導演便給覺新變「老」了。胡士奇演得頗好，可是化裝不免使他委曲。劉一心的「祖父」，田心的「陳姨太」總算不錯。葉天球的「道士」演技談不上。莊虹君的「僕人」頗好。諸亦貞的「周氏」太呆滯，表情不够，而且服飾也嫌「過於普通」了。胡了然的「五叔」是演得不弱的，可惜多了些「低級趣味」的做作，不免「小丑化」，倘能改正「揚州大少派」的文明戲作風，前途自有希望。演「張琴」的王雪艷是不合個性的，張琴這種「女學生」不是王雪艷所可能演飾的，有種「下意識的妞妮」，是最最要不得的「文明戲特色」，而發音不自然，硬逼得尖聲怪氣的，更不可以。至於范素琴的「婉兒」很好。最最成功的是演「鳴鳳」的蔡娟娟，其餘就是顧夢鶴的「高覺慧」了。蔡娟娟吐字是那樣的淸楚，表淸是那樣的細膩，的確是一位値得贊揚的女演員。顧夢鶴的弱點也在年歲太不「靑」，大體上是把握住「覺慧」的性格。</p>
<p>第三，我想說一說編劇和導演。嘉其太圖「省事」了。原著上的「人物」刪得太多，與整個故事有關係的「梅」「端珏」「叔」「四叔」「三嬸」「四嬸」姑媽」「淑英」「淑華」等都沒有出現在舞台上。而在放事的編排上也蜴力倫懶，梅的「死」，端珏的「死」，祖父的「死」等都祗在口頭叙述裏。尤其是祖父的死，是「家」的崩潰的開始，他能覺悟到自己的過錯，他能認識「世家」的空虛，所以臨終前和覺民覺慧的懇談是極有意義的，關於這，在巴金的畫上就是很動人的一節，舞台上把談話提前到「客廳」裏，把一個「高潮」輕輕放過，編劇的錯誤及導演的無能，演三小時的劇本竟一無「高潮」，未免太笑話了。</p>
<p>總之，我不蔑親綠實，但是不得不指出：他是失敗了的。這决上演「家」當然是一種好的趨向，但劇本的選擇須特別愼重，導演的人才更要注意，而最基本的，是演員的修養。</p>

<p>柳如是在虞山先後聽到毓祺義師覆舟，兵敗出奔，被逮遇害等兇耗，扼腕太息。毓祺被害之日，柳如是爲了他，哭了一夜，淚濕枕被。錢牧齋却私自慶幸自己沒有代毓祺起草檄文，吾則必受滅門之禍了。然而柳如是犒師的事，外間不免微有洩漏，金陵方面便要查問此事，治錢叛逆之罪。牧　萬分發急，不得已畫出家財，不足時史向親族告貸，到南京去上下使用，買了不少人情，方纔把這事隱蔽過去，漸漸平息牧齋雖不敢怪怨如是，而如是爲了此事，更覺意念俱灰，匿居不出。絳雲樓又遭視融之災，境况日見惡劣。其間牧齋雖曾一度赴燕京去做尙青，然而也非柳如是的素願。伊會用話幾度諷諫，而終不能挽回牧齋之心。况且牧齋已被淸延注意，到這時候也不得不去爲他人奴，不由自己作主了。因此牧齋北行，柳如是却仍螯居虞山，杜門不出，絕不願意到那腥風羶氣的燕京去，以免刺傷了伊嫩弱的心。牧齋也無可如何。他到了北京，並無什麽事業可以做。一般獻媚求榮者流，搶在他的前面，也挨不到他，反而受着計多熱嘲冷諷，令人難堪。最後仍回轉虞山，得不償失，名和利都是鏡花水月，而且顚倒給人家譏笑，眞是一朝失足，遺恨千古，明哲保身，又復何益？而且逋負人家的債很多，因此常常不樂。柳如是躬行節儉，荊釵布裙，一洗昔日紛華，人都稱頌伊的賢德。牧齋鬱鬱不得志，如是却把君子樂道安貧的意思勸慰他。牧齋此時更懊悔以前沒有一死殉國了。</p>

<h3>The World Situation Changes in the Blink of an Eye; US Vigilance is Necessary; Secretaries of the Navy and War Urge Conferring Full Powers on the President; Roosevelt Does Not Approve of Limiting Suggestions; and Has No Intention of Modifying the Lend-Lease Steps</h3>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt stated at a press conference yesterday, "There are several provisions in the 'Aid to Democracies Act' that are specifically designed to protect the United States." He said that the world changes so rapidly in 24 hours that he has no intention of modifying those steps. The President then addressed the general public's claim that the bill would give him the power to buy the British fleet if Britain were defeated, dismissing it as "the cow jumping over the moon" speculation. He further criticized those who opposed the bill, saying that it does not stipulate that the President is not allowed to act perversely, but that the President of the United States has no intention of acting perversely. He also stated that the selling of the American Navy is out of the question. Roosevelt then reaffirmed that former Ambassador to Britain, Kennedy, has the right to make a nationwide broadcast tonight, but that Kennedy's speech should be delivered only after he has formed a genuine understanding of the bill. The President criticized the reports in the Tokyo "Asahi Shimbun" and other Japanese newspapers that the American fleet had withdrawn from Hawaii, considering it to be another "newspaper story." (United Press Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt met with reporters yesterday and stated that he did not approve of suggestions to limit the Lend-Lease Act. He humorously said that if limiting clauses were inserted, then another clause should be inserted to prevent the American president from standing on his head according to this bill. He also emphasized that in this world of rapidly changing events, vigilance is necessary, and the insertion of a clause in the Lend-Lease Act allowing the Departments of Navy and War to purchase war materials for friendly nations is merely a measure of precaution. When reporters mentioned that naval and military figures had advised that the President's policy of aiding Britain was a mistake and that Japan had suggested recalling the American fleet from Hawaii, the President replied that the former was news from Italian newspapers and the latter was a rumor from Japanese newspapers. Reporters then asked if he had recently received any documents from Britain regarding the urgent need for aid. The President replied no. Finally, reporters inquired whether the former director of the International Labor Office in Geneva, Winant, would be selected to be the ambassador to Britain, replacing Kennedy. The President replied that this rumor did not originate from sources close to the White House. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington – The political activity here is now focused on the Aid to Britain Act. Secretary of the Navy Knox (the Republican candidate for vice president in the 1936 election) spoke before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, strongly supporting the bill. The pronouncements of any high official of the American government have rarely been so decisive. In addition to making a startling comparison of the combined fleet strengths of the Axis powers and the American fleet, to show the superiority of the Axis navies over the United States both now and in the coming years, Knox also declared in a firm tone that if Germany defeats Britain, the Americas will certainly suffer the consequences. At the same time, Senator Wheeler, a leader of the isolationist faction, rose to attack the bill, demanding the release of the reports that Ambassador to Britain Kennedy and Ambassador to France Bullitt sent to the American government before the war. President Roosevelt also personally joined the debate, refuting in a press conference that the bill would endanger the nation by granting excessive power to the president. Secretary of War Stimson continued to present his views to the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday, stating that no American president has ever rashly placed the nation in war, and Congress can rest assured to entrust the president with the broad responsibilities proposed in this bill, allowing the president to decide which countries should receive American aid. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington – Secretaries of the Navy Knox and War Stimson simultaneously warned yesterday that Britain will face a crisis within sixty to ninety days, and urged Congress to grant President Roosevelt significant powers to implement the Lend-Lease Act to aid Britain. The two secretaries spoke in succession during a meeting of the House Foreign Affairs Committee discussing the bill. Neither objected to the Republican proposal to limit the duration of the president's powers to two years, but both echoed Secretary of State Hull's remarks on Wednesday, opposing any further restrictions. The Secretary of the Navy stated that Britain's crisis may result from an enemy launching a fierce attack in coordination with submarines and air forces when launching a real invasion. (United Press Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington – The President of the American Federation of Labor, Green, telegraphed Republican Congressman Fish of New York, stating that some details of the Lend-Lease Act may need to be amended, but in his opinion, the principles of the bill should become law. It is noted that Fish is one of the opponents of the Lend-Lease Act. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Pretending to Be Benevolent; Attempting to Dominate Neighboring Countries; Indian Newspapers Condemn Japanese Aggression; Seizing the Northeast Was the Origin of the War</h3>
<p>Bombay – Various newspapers of the Indian National Congress recently condemned the proceedings of the "League for the Liberation of Southeast Asian Nations" by Japan. The Free Press Journal stated that "Japan, intoxicated with pride, is now feigning benevolence, focusing on South and East Asia. However, how has Japan treated its neighbors in the past? First, it seized Korea and the three northeastern provinces of China, and now it is occupying mainland China. It can be seen that Japan's so-called rescuing of others is actually controlling and exploiting them. Over the past thirty years, Japan's actions have all been unfriendly, causing the country to be deeply dissatisfied with overseas countries. Japan's invasion of the Northeast was the origin of the current war." (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt Inaugurated Tomorrow; Zhu Jiahua Sends Congratulatory Telegram</h3>
<p>Washington – When President Roosevelt rides from Philadelphia to the Capitol next Monday, an unprecedented ceremony in American history will be presented to the public, as the President takes the oath of office for his third consecutive term, which is unprecedented. Thousands of people have already come here to prepare to watch. According to the President's physician, the President's condition and health are currently the best they have been in recent years. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Member of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, Zhu Jiahua, recently sent a telegram congratulating President Roosevelt on his inauguration on Monday. (United Press Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>US Treasury Allocates 50 Million Gold; For China, Britain, and Argentina; Used to Balance Currency Values</h3>
<p>Washington – A Federal Reserve Bank report released yesterday stated that the US Treasury Department has allocated $50 million for use by Britain, China, and Argentina to balance their currency values. As China and Argentina gradually withdraw these funds, the excess reserves of banks in the Federal Reserve Banks will need to be increased in the future. (United Press Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Australia Willing to Fulfill Responsibility; Cooperate Fully with the United States</h3>
<p>Boston – The Australian Minister to the United States, Casey, stated in a speech here today that if the United States unfortunately engages in a Pacific war, Australia is willing to fully cooperate with the United States. Australia is located on the opposite side of the Pacific, with a vast territory, and its people are strong, friendly, well-trained, and can supply most of the necessary firepower and weapons. All of these should not be ignored. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Knox Urges Full Aid to Britain</h3>
<p>Maintaining the Joint Naval Power of Britain and America; Preventing German Invasion of South America</p>
<p>Washington – Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox expressed his views to the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday regarding aid to democratic countries, advocating full aid to Britain to prevent German invasion of South America. Knox stated that if Britain's maritime power is eliminated, Germany will shift its attention to seizing the natural resources of South America. He declared that if Germany gains the leisure to cross the ocean and conquer new territories, it will first invade South America, seizing the large storehouse of resources there. If the United States does not want to face the consequences of establishing an invading military force in South America, then we must prevent Germany from defeating Britain's naval forces, as England is currently fighting the Nazis in Europe. Exaggerating the importance of naval strength to our country and the entire Western Hemisphere is impossible because the existence of the maritime power of Britain and our country ensures that the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans become barriers to prevent the insatiable desires of aggressive nations. Europe should be seen as a major stage in the dictators' attempt to dominate Europe and most of the world. The Nazi regime has already felt that the power of its own army is insufficient to establish hegemony because Europe's raw materials are insufficient for self-sufficiency, and when the Nazi army fails to control the seas, it is also powerless to obtain these raw materials. Great Britain has never been able to support an army capable of conquering Europe on its own, and Britain relies on the control of sea power to maintain its survival. The current struggle is fundamentally an attempt by Germany to seize China's control of the oceans, and the development of its advances is not hindered. However, it is believed that once sea power falls into the hands of Germany, the situation will certainly be very different. (United Press Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington – US Secretary of the Navy Knox submitted figures on naval strength to the House Foreign Affairs Committee to prove that the American fleet is still insufficient to match the combined navies of the Axis powers. One table showed that the total tonnage of warships already built by the United States was 1,250,000 tons, the total tonnage already built by Germany and Italy was 850,000 tons, but when adding the Japanese fleet, it amounted to 1,835,000 tons, and when adding the French fleet, it amounted to 2,145,000 tons. Knox also told the Foreign Affairs Committee that the US Navy is the strongest in the world, but if Britain is defeated, Germany will possess European shipyards, and its shipbuilding capacity and speed will be seven times that of the United States. (United Press Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington – Secretary of the Navy Knox, while urging Congress to pass the Lend-Lease Act, said that figures for the next three years show that the Axis fleets, from battleships to submarines, surpass the US fleet in every aspect. Although the United States may add one hundred new ships built in the next two years to the fleet, the Axis fleets will have three hundred new ships and a four-fold expansion of new fleets. It is predicted that the largest increase in Axis warships will be submarines. In January 1942, the United States may have 342 warships, while the Axis powers may have 803. By January 1943, the US fleet will have 422 ships, while the Axis powers will have a total of 962. The fact that the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans have been able to serve as obstacles to prevent the aggressive countries from devouring everything is due to the joint naval power of Britain and America. The ability of the United States to maintain its Monroe Doctrine in the past fifteen years is also due to Britain's support. The United States can use its resources to help Britain and prepare for itself. The price we must pay now is money, strength, and sacrifice, but if we stand idly by and watch Britain fall, then the price we must pay will soon be far greater than this. This decision is fundamentally Germany's attempt to seize British sea power. Since the last great war, the United States has only maintained a naval fleet in the Pacific Ocean, and its ability to cope with both oceans depends on the existence and development of the British navy, allowing us to rest easy about the Atlantic Ocean. In reality, Britain and the United States have two oceanic navies, cooperating with each other and dedicated to maintaining peace. Dictatorial countries have long been plotting to extend their control over most of the world, and the current European war is only their most recent attempt. The United States felt the need to develop a strong navy only in the past fifty years. Germany is building a large navy to invade distant lands, and Japan is expanding its labor force to peaceful countries outside its borders. Such circumstances have forced the United States to have a strong navy. If the American people want to prevent the scourge of war from occurring on American soil, then they must prepare their arms. If Britain and its navy exist safely, then the American people can prepare calmly and still maintain their interests throughout the world. He is convinced that Britain can remain undefeated with our unwavering assistance. Therefore, on the one hand, we should strengthen our naval power as quickly as possible, and on the other hand, we should help Britain in every possible way to overcome its difficulties. This is the most beneficial way for the country. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Stimson Advocates Sending Ships into War Zones</h3>
<p>Answered Questions from the Opposition in the House of Representatives; The Lend-Lease Act Will Not Lead the US into War</p>
<p>Washington – Secretary of War Stimson stated yesterday during his second day of testifying before the House of Representatives that he opposed the suggestion of not allowing the American Navy to sail into war zones. He said, "No one can foresee what events related to our national defense will occur in the future, at which time we may need to send warships into war zones. I do not believe that under any circumstances, our country should tie its right hand behind its back." Representative Tinkham, who opposes the bill, immediately asked, "Shouldn't we do so even if it is to avoid war?" The Secretary of War replied, "I believe this move will undoubtedly lead us into war or allow us to be attacked under the most unfavorable circumstances. I advocate that the United States should maintain its state of readiness under any circumstances." The Secretary of War also expressed his opposition to the committee's suggestion of not allowing foreign warships to undertake transportation work. He also stated, "I support the original bill. All the amendments are placing considerable obstacles on a country in extraordinary times." Secretary of War Stimson answered Representative Tinkham's questions for a full fifty minutes. Then, Republican Congresswoman Rogers of Massachusetts asked if the bill would authorize the president to send the Navy, merchant ships, or tank cars to foreign countries at will. The Secretary of War replied, "Obviously, the president will have the power to do so, but it is a misunderstanding to think that the president will use this to sell the Navy to foreigners." Mrs. Rogers asked if the bill would also prompt the United States to adopt a policy of "acting as a policeman in the world"? The Secretary of War replied, "No, I mean the opposite. I do not want the United States to participate in the war, just like you. I support the president's bill because I believe it can make our country safer." The Secretary of War stated that he was extremely dissatisfied with the progress of the national defense program. Representative Fries of Ohio asked, "Should we first establish an agreement to stipulate the status of the British fleet before effectively implementing the program?" He replied, "This issue was carefully considered last summer. We requested a guarantee, which was soon given to us by a certain democratic country." The Secretary of War was referring to Britain's guarantee to the United States that the British fleet would not surrender to the enemy under any circumstances. The Secretary of War also stated, "In war, nothing is impossible. This is why I strongly advocate aiding Britain, not allowing it to be on the verge of surrender, lest it violate the law." (United Press Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington – Secretary of War Stimson told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that he was not without concern about the possibility of changes occurring within two or three months. Stimson answered a question from a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, saying that the Lend-Lease Act would not lead the United States into war. A member of the Foreign Affairs Committee asked, "Is the aid stipulated in this bill necessary to prevent Britain from failing?" Stimson replied, "In my opinion, it is very necessary." A Democratic member of the Foreign Affairs Committee asked, "If Britain fails sooner or later, will we fight with our public debt and manpower? Is this your opinion?" Stimson replied, "This is my personal opinion." One suggestion was that the broad powers proposed in this bill should be granted to a committee, but Stimson opposed it, considering it dangerous, but said that he would not object if the time limit for the president to exercise this power was limited to one year.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Axis Powers' Offensive is Approaching Sunset</h3>
<p>Recently, the United States Congress has been intensely debating the Aid to Democracies Act. If it can be passed smoothly, the three countries of China, Britain, and Greece will be the targets of aid, and will inevitably obtain unprecedentedly large military supplies from the United States, sufficient to break the current stalemate in the two sets of wars in Europe and Asia in one fell swoop. This is, of course, a critical juncture, and it is expected that the three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan are in a similar state of mind to "prisoners awaiting trial." On the one hand, they are anxiously awaiting the arrival of misfortune, and on the other hand, they hope to be lucky in one out of ten thousand. Therefore, it is expected that around the establishment of the Aid Act, the Allied countries will inevitably have a final struggle. Among them, Japan and Italy are both in supporting roles, waiting for Germany's victory or defeat to determine their own fate. Italy loses every battle and is overwhelmed, unable to fight back, so there is no need to say more. Japan has made enough gestures to advance south, but it also needs Hitler to launch an offensive, gain an advantage, and restrain the powers of the democratic countries in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Balkan regions, easing the resistance it will encounter in the South Pacific, and then launch this final and most dangerous attempt. The key to East and West lies here, so this article will focus on Germany's future actions, particularly its offensive in the Balkans.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the news of German troops entering Bulgaria caused a great stir, but as a result, the Soviet Union stated "neither knew nor agreed" beforehand, and Bulgaria formally denied it afterward. Regardless of whether there was a reason behind it, it did not materialize. Generally, after the German troops entered Romania, they only advanced to the banks of the Danube River and did not cross the river into Bulgaria. This is true. Although Hitler did his best to prepare for the Balkan war, he was hesitant and unsure of how to proceed. The reason for this is either because there is no such need at present or because there are still many obstacles ahead, so he has to repeatedly delay. First, the so-called "no such need" does not mean that Hitler is willing to give up the Balkans. In fact, quite the opposite. In order to counter Britain's blockade, he must turn the Balkans into a large base and warehouse. However, what he needs is a peaceful and productive Balkans, not a war-torn and dilapidated Balkans. According to pre-war statistics in 1938, more than half of Germany's foreign trade was in Europe, and among European countries, the proportion of Balkan countries was the largest. For example, Bulgaria's exports to Germany accounted for 58.9% of its total exports, and imports from Germany accounted for 51.9% of its total imports. Yugoslavia's exports accounted for 35.9%, and imports accounted for 32.5%. Romania's exports accounted for 26.5%, and imports accounted for 36.9%. Greece's exports accounted for 38.5%, and imports accounted for 28.8%. It was already like this before the war, and today, after Britain has implemented a blockade and overseas trade has been almost completely cut off, the numbers are certainly even greater. Therefore, from Germany's point of view, as long as Britain cannot threaten Germany's dominant position in the Balkans, Hitler can temporarily remain inactive, so that on the one hand, he can intensify economic exploitation, and on the other hand, he can consolidate military control, thereby realizing the ideal of "base" and "warehouse." Of course, this policy must be based on the premise that the Italian-Greek war continues to be stalemated. If the Italian army completely fails and cannot gain a foothold in Albania, then Britain, with the help of Greece and Turkey, can easily launch an anti-Axis Balkan group in Southeastern Europe. At that time, Germany's position on the Eastern Front may completely collapse, so it certainly cannot sit and wait for death.</p>
<p>Second, the so-called "many obstacles" refers to the opposition of third countries. For example, the statement issued by the Soviet Union regarding the entry of German troops into Bulgaria, as cited above, seems very bland, but in fact it is extremely cold, and it was issued on the day that the German-Soviet economic demarcation agreements were still fresh. It certainly made people in Berlin laugh and cry. Originally, the Soviet Union could not be indifferent to the issue of peace and war in the Balkans. Of course, it could not allow Germany to arbitrarily manipulate Bulgaria, a Slavic country. It is said that Molotov's visit to Berlin in November of last year was aimed at maintaining the economic relationship between the two countries, but with the premise that Germany would not interfere in the Balkans. Although there is no way to verify the truth of this statement, it does have some similarities with recent events. In addition to the Soviet Union, Turkey's attitude is also a factor that Hitler must consider. When the rumors of German troops entering Bulgaria were rampant a few days ago, the Turkish official spokesman clearly stated that if German troops did enter Bulgaria, the ten countries would declare war. This was the first warning. Immediately afterward, the British Near East military authorities jointly visited Turkey and held secret talks with the country's General Staff, reportedly to discuss how the British and Turkish armies would implement a joint defense plan in the event of a German southward advance. This was clearly a second warning.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that although Hitler must launch a final offensive after the US Aid Act is established and before it is actually used, given his circumstances and situation, he seems unwilling and dare not immediately participate directly in the war in the Balkans. If he really ignores everything and brazenly passes through Bulgaria to attack Greece, it must be because he feels the urgency of the crisis and has no choice but to take this "last resort." As for the present, he will probably continue to rely mainly on air raids, so that on the one hand, he can bomb the British mainland, and on the other hand, he can use his newly acquired base in Sicily, southern Italy, to threaten the British fleet and merchant ships in the Mediterranean. Then, he will wait for the time to ripen before launching his final "late winter offensive" or "spring offensive" on various fronts.</p>

<h3>Highway Between China and India: Ministry of Communications Considering Construction; Survey Team to Depart Soon</h3>
<p>Chongqing. According to various Chinese sources, the Ministry of Communications is currently actively considering a plan to build a highway via Xinqu to connect India and China. It is said that a survey team will depart soon to survey the actual route. The most likely route under consideration would pass through Kangding, Bo'anka Sok, Xudeng, Wopate Mo, Natio (all transliterations except Kangding), to Sadiya in Assam, the northern terminus of the Bengal Assam Railway, which is a direct railway line to Calcutta. This route is a total of 1,650 kilometers long. Another possible route under discussion is via Chengdu to Lhasa, then south to British India. As for the construction of this highway, there are no natural impossibilities. This can be seen from the Burma Road and the newly built Kunming Xufu Highway, as both routes must pass through undulating mountain ranges, but they have been completed by Chinese engineers and workers in a short period.

<h3>US Naval Bases on Both Oceans: Under Rapid Construction; Knox Writes Article Looking to the Future; American People Must Shoulder Heavy Responsibilities</h3>
<p>Washington. Secretary of the Navy Knox wrote an article looking to the future of 1941, stating that one thing is almost unavoidable: the American people must all fully shoulder the heavy responsibility of national defense in order to cope with the current world situation. The nation has already formulated a major program aimed at protecting the Western Hemisphere from the ravages of war. Within our defenses, there are three major forces: capital, industry, and labor. With the collaborative efforts of these three, coupled with the efforts of the Navy Department, the War Department, and the National Defense Committee, the current plans can proceed rapidly. However, the overall situation is extremely complex, and many things need to be addressed in the future. Therefore, this year is indeed a critical year. The naval construction program is currently proceeding at full speed, with intensified work and no effort spared. The fleet is the most powerful force for naval attack, and its strength will be greatly enhanced by the end of this year. Our country will have two new battleships, 3,000 new naval aircraft, at least ten submarines, fourteen new destroyers, and many other repair ships and lighters. Various ships purchased from the US Maritime Commission and private shipping companies will be converted into transport ships, oil tankers, ammunition ships, minelayers, and minesweepers for naval use. The driving personnel are already prepared. The Navy Department is recruiting personnel and conducting extensive training. It has never been easier than this year. Four thousand reserve personnel will be trained at Northwestern University in Illinois and at the Annapolis Naval Academy. As for the pilots and mechanics of the new aircraft, there will always be enough to meet the needs. The eight Atlantic naval and air bases leased from Britain this year are currently under construction and will become the outposts of naval defense. Therefore, by the end of this year, if an enemy crosses the Atlantic to attack the Americas, they will definitely have to engage in a major naval battle with our navy far from the coast. The various naval and air bases in the Pacific Ocean are proceeding very rapidly according to the planned schedule and should be completed within this year. I feel very pleased with the progress of all my naval construction projects, including those on the surface of the water and those on land. (18th Associated Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>Full Text of Hull's Speech</h3>
<p>Washington. The full text of the speech given by US Secretary of State Hull to the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday is as follows: "We are here to consider" a bill aimed at improving US national defense. I do not wish to go on to discuss the technical details of this plan, as the relevant departments in charge of such matters will do so.</p>
<p>America Will Strive to Seek Peace</p>
<p>What I will briefly present to you is the important fact of how danger has already arrived on this earth and the preparation that this country must rise up and promote to cope with this danger. In the past eight years, our government has striven to use all its peaceful means to build a situation in which the world can have a reasonable hope for continued peace. We firmly believe that only such a situation can ensure that our country is truly secure and enjoys peace. The establishment of this situation requires that all countries accept and apply certain fundamental principles of peaceful and friendly conduct and relations between nations. Therefore, in handling international relations, our government has striven to achieve the following goals: (1) The peace and security of the United States, which is indeed aimed at peace and the limitation and reduction of armaments by the five powers; (2) The principles of law, order, justice, morality, and freedom; (3) Restoring and promoting sound economic agreements and relations based on equal treatment; (4) Developing practical methods of international cooperation to the fullest extent in promoting this goal; (5) Enhancing the security, unity, and general welfare of the Western Hemisphere. Obeying and upholding the basic principles and efforts of this policy and promoting its acceptance and application are now becoming increasingly important, as three countries have successively expressed in words and deeds their determination to abandon and destroy the civilized world under the rule of law and embark on the path of conquering other countries by force and oppressing their people. The beginning of this terrible trend occurred in the Far East in 1931, when the Nine-Power Treaty and the Pact of Paris were violated and Manchuria was occupied by force.</p>
<p>Severely Criticizing Japan's Military Invasion of China</p>
<p>The balance of power in the Far East established by the Washington Conference of 1921-22 was greatly shaken by the establishment of the Japanese-controlled Manchuria in part of China by force. The most prominent feature of Manchuria under Japanese rule was the implementation of a discriminatory policy, as a result of which the interests of the United States and other countries were squeezed out. In 1932, Japan actively prepared to expand by force. In December 1934, Japan expressed its intention to terminate the naval agreement of February 6, 1922, and then proceeded to intensify the manufacture of naval and land armaments, and often took definite actions to expand its rule in China, disregarding and destroying the legitimate rights of the United States and other countries. In July 1937, the Japanese army began large-scale military operations against China, and more than a million invading troops occupied vast areas of the coastal and central provinces, establishing puppet rule in the occupied areas and implementing a controlled and monopolistic discriminatory system to seek the interests of the aggressor country. Japan's extensive and ambitious plan from the beginning, intending to achieve a position of dominance in the western Pacific, is completely obvious. Japanese leaders have openly declared that they are determined to achieve and maintain this position by force and become the master of an area that owns half of the world's population. As a result, Japan will be able to arbitrarily control navigation and commercial traffic in the region. Past experiences and current developments tell us that the so-called new order in the Pacific region is simply a country exercising political dominance. Economically speaking, all the resources of the region are exclusively enjoyed by that country, resulting in the impoverishment of other countries in the region and the exclusion of the interests of other countries. Socially speaking, the individual is annihilated, and the conquered people will be placed in a degraded position. Anyone should understand that this process of conquering nearly half of the world's population is an extremely important event that has significant implications for all other countries, no matter where they are located. Although Japan has adopted this approach in recent years, the United States government has repeatedly advised the Japanese government that its best interests lie in establishing friendly relations with the United States and other countries, and that the United States and other countries trust the international order and peace. We have not made any threats.</p>
<p>Italy Disrupts Order in Europe</p>
<p>In Europe, the first to disrupt the world order was Italy. In 1935, the country invaded Abyssinia, directly violating the solemn obligations of the League of Nations and the Pact of Paris. In 1939, Italy violated its affirmative treaty obligations by seizing Albania. In the summer of 1940, Italy openly joined the European war, declaring that its purpose in assisting Germany was to change the status quo in the world based on a new order established on the unlimited use of force. Finally, it attacked Greece without cause. During this period, the US government made it clear to the Italian government that the United States was extremely concerned about the deteriorating state of international peace relations. During the Italian-Abyssinian War and before Italy joined the European war, the US government repeatedly notified the Italian government in the hope of preventing further disruption of the world order. After Hitler and his colleagues gained power in Germany in 1933, they began a frenzy of building massive armaments, while constantly using deceitful diplomatic tricks to dispel the suspicions of other countries. After months of implementing its characteristic inch-by-inch strategy at the Geneva Disarmament Conference, Germany finally withdrew from the Disarmament Conference in October 1933, making it impossible for international arms limitation agreements to be concluded. In the six years thereafter, Germany, having decided on a policy of unlimited conquest, marched down the path of war. Germany's preparations can be divided into two parts. The first part was building up military force. To achieve this goal, its entire national economy has been transformed into a highly controlled and disciplined war economy. Every economic activity is necessary for war preparation. Most of its national revenue is used for military purposes. Foreign trade and foreign payments are also subject to strict control for the same purpose. The production of aircraft, tanks, artillery, and all other accessories that constitute the machinery of modern warfare has become the urgent goal of the national effort.</p>
<p>Germans Repeatedly Violate Promises</p>
<p>The second part of the work includes various steps necessary to improve Germany's strategic position. The first of these was the direct tearing up of the Locarno Treaty in 1936, the occupation of the Rhineland, and the establishment of fortifications there. Following this, Hitler directly violated his promise to respect the sovereignty and independence of Austria and annexed Austria. After annexing Austria, Hitler again made guarantees that Germany had no further territorial demands in Europe. However, he soon violated his promise, publicly expressed in 1938, to respect the independence of Czechoslovakia, and divided and occupied Czechoslovakia. After this came the annexation of Memel. Finally, on September 1, 1939, he launched a fierce attack on Poland and divided it. During the war, he also violated the neutrality of Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, and violated his guarantees to respect the sovereignty and independence of several of these countries by invading them. After invading Denmark, Norway, and other countries, there followed the invasion and partial occupation of France, and the division of Romania and the occupation of part of that country. The Germans carried out these occupations by simultaneously employing both armed attacks and sabotage, attacking from both inside and outside. Every country that was invaded and occupied inevitably faced a reign of terror and the danger of absolutism. The aggressors, through their words and deeds, have clearly decided to permanently place these unfortunate countries under tyranny. The US government, in the hope that there was still a glimmer of hope to make the German leaders stop the strategy they were pursuing, never neglected the opportunities it encountered. The United States had offered its assistance again in economic adjustments in the hope of resolving the difficulties of the time by peaceful means. However, all such hopes were dashed as the Nazi troops invaded Poland and launched a new war in Europe. From that time on, what humanity faced was not a local war, but an organized, irrational, and hateful widespread act of conquest. We are now faced with all sorts of forces, forces that are not restricted by laws, order, and moral principles. Their aggressive program is also unlimited. These forces have now spread to most of the land and will control the oceans, in order to achieve and maintain their goal of conquering another continent. (To be continued tomorrow)</p>

<h3>French Ships Sink Two Thai Ships in the Gulf of Siam; Another Heavily Damaged; Thailand Claims French Ships Have Been Repulsed</h3>
<p>Saigon. Several warships belonging to the French Far East Fleet cruised the Gulf of Siam today, encountering several Thai warships near the coast of Vietnam. At the time, the Thai fleet was attacking a French aircraft. The French warships immediately engaged them, sinking two Thai ships and heavily damaging another. There were no casualties on the French side. According to reports, a French fleet also patrolled the sea there a month ago, and several Thai aircraft invaded Vietnamese territorial waters without French provocation and bombed French ships.

<h3>Nazi Air Force Participates in Mediterranean War; Rome Declares New Phase to Begin; British Malta Under Severe Threat</h3>
<p>Rome - Rome Radio announced that a new phase of the war is about to begin, predicting that the Axis air force will launch a fierce attack on British naval power in the Mediterranean. Shortly after the broadcast, it was announced here last night that a large number of local officials and deputy officials have been replaced, affecting the Italian administrative regions of Milan, Turin, Ferrara, and Agrigento, as well as seven smaller administrative regions. Two weeks ago, according to an exclusive interview regarding international relations, the new phase of the war was predicted to begin around the time of President Roosevelt's inauguration. Unofficial sources revealed that the Axis powers have almost completed preparations for major operations in the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. (The above telegram was deleted by Italian censors.) (International News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>Cairo - The British Middle East Air Force Command issued a communiqué stating, "Yesterday, a squadron of Italian aircraft, along with several German CR-42, Junkers 87, and Junkers 88 aircraft, bombed our island of Malta. Our fighter squadrons immediately took to the air to intercept them, shooting down five enemy aircraft. We suffered no losses, but there was significant damage to civilian property." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin - It is reported that during the first appearance of the German air force in the Mediterranean, two British warships were destroyed. On the 16th, an attack was launched on the port of Valletta, British Malta, heavily bombing the aircraft carrier "Illustrious," which was undergoing repairs. Whether the ship can be used again is questionable. At the same time, the port's facilities and docks were also heavily damaged. (Haitong, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Sources close to the German High Command stated that the bombing of the British aircraft carrier docked in Malta is strategically significant. The port's defenses are unusually strong, and its armaments are sufficient. If an aircraft carrier can be lost in Malta, then the fall of the island is a foregone conclusion. German air bases are only 200 kilometers from the island, reachable in less than an hour. The German General Staff can guarantee that the supply of bombs is inexhaustible. The entry of German aircraft into the Mediterranean marks the beginning of a new phase in the war at sea, which can be asserted with certainty. (Haitong, 18th)</p>
<p>Cairo - Yesterday, the British Air Force issued a communiqué stating that on Wednesday night, the British Air Force again attacked the German air base in Catania, Sicily. During the first wave of attacks, a hangar in the northwest was hit, causing a violent explosion and fire, which was visible from over 150 miles away. Later British aircraft easily identified their targets and dropped heavy bombs, setting fire to the airfield administration building. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<p>London - British Prime Minister Churchill and Air Minister Sir Archibald Sinclair jointly issued the most optimistic statements since the start of the war yesterday, predicting that Britain will soon be victorious. While inspecting civil defense work, the Prime Minister said, "Britain will achieve a complete and final victory. I have no doubt whatsoever." Sir Archibald Sinclair went further than the Prime Minister, saying, "The British Air Force will continue to strike German and Italian key centers more fiercely, paving the way for victory this year." Sinclair also stated, "The British have long controlled the skies over the British Isles." (International News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>London - Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech in Glasgow last night after inspecting defenses, warning the British people of the dangers and pain in the coming months, but said that he had no doubts about the outcome of the war. The Prime Minister also said that Britain is now seeking weapons, ships, and aircraft from the United States. Mr. Hopkins (President Roosevelt's personal envoy to Britain) has come to Britain to establish the closest possible relations with all parties here and will soon report everything to the US President. There is now a strong army on the British Isles, and the coasts are well-defended, well-managed, and behind the defenses, there is a large mobile force that can advance and attack any enemy forces. Referring to the coming months, Churchill said, "I do not hope to pass the time easily. The future is as dangerous as we have already experienced. If we are negligent, we will miss the opportunity. In the months ahead, we must endure the bombing and suffering of towns and industrial areas." (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<h3>British Air Force Bravely Bombs Wilhelmshaven; Combats Severe Weather; Achieves Satisfactory Results</h3>
<p>London - On Thursday night, British Air Force bombers attacked the German naval base at Wilhelmshaven, causing a large fire that could be seen from 130 miles away. The British aircraft fought through the worst winter weather to reach their destination. As one pilot said, "This trip was not like an air raid, but like a flight to the ends of the earth." The bomb racks, gun turrets, and cockpit windows of the attacking British aircraft were all covered in ice, and the machinery froze repeatedly. The difficulties encountered by the British aircraft were not limited to the extreme cold but also included electrical storms. When one aircraft was struck by lightning, the co-pilot was injured and unable to fly. The back electrical wire of another bomber was also severed. According to one pilot's description of the attack, "After leaving the base, we climbed to 7,000 feet into the clouds and immediately began to freeze. We struggled to climb higher, eventually reaching 20,000 feet, but still did not break through the clouds. The front window was covered with ice and could not be seen through, but we continued to fly forward with difficulty. Blue lightning flashed along the way for two hours. As we approached Haling Haven, the lightning became more intense, blinding us. The plane was eventually struck by lightning, which must have hit the front gun turret. I was dizzy and could not see anything for several minutes. This was the most violent electrical storm we had ever encountered. After a while, I saw anti-aircraft fire from the side window and bombed the anti-aircraft batteries. After finishing the task, we flew back." According to a communiqué issued by the Ministry of Aviation yesterday, British Air Force bombers raided Wilhelmshaven on Sunday night, causing a large fire. The British aircraft targeted Wilhelmshaven as the main target of the attack, undeterred by weather and electrical storms. Although the scale of the attack was smaller than that of Wednesday night, it achieved satisfactory results. The first British aircraft to arrive dropped bombs, causing multiple large fires. The subsequent aircraft reported that the fire was spreading widely, and the fire station and oil pools were burning fiercely, with multiple explosions. Other British aircraft attacked the shipyards of Emden, Cologne, and Essen, the railway junction of Uvent, and an airfield in occupied France. A total of five British aircraft were lost.

<p>Painful History of the European War (8)</p>
<h3>Memories of a Disorganized British and French Front</h3>
<p>This is another chapter from the book "The Tragedy of France" by the French writer Morlaix, translated as follows:</p>
<p>In early May 1940, I went to the front to visit the 7th Army, commanded by French General Corap, which was the first army to be defeated by the Germans a few days later. The army headquarters was located in the small village of Vervins. Vervins is an old-fashioned town with deserted streets and half-closed shutters. The officers and soldiers walked on the rough cobblestone streets, listening to the squeak of their leather boots, showing their leisurely attitude, as if they were civil servants going to work at the office at the appointed time in peaceful times.</p>
<p>The night I arrived in the town, I wrote a letter to my wife saying, "I have met many loyal and good people in this place, but they seem too old-fashioned and too stubborn..."</p>
<p>General Corap was timid by nature and lacked the spirit of a warrior. He was also potbellied, and it was difficult for him to tie his leggings and get into his car. Although he talked and laughed, he always gave people the impression that he paid too much attention to the past.</p>
<p>I inspected the troops stationed outside Fulmay and Kevilvie and was very surprised to see that the guards were sparse and the soldiers were few. On the way back to Vervins, I walked through a deserted place. The car passed through village after village, with no defense in the villages, which made me think that once the enemy broke through the border defenses, they could drive straight in. At the entrance of the town, there were wooden barbed wire obstacles that even children could push down, one sentry with a bayonet, and one police officer, and that was it! It was nothing short of a daydream to try to stop the enemy's armored forces.</p>
<p>In fact, the Polish campaign had already shown that the equipment of the British and French armies was far from sufficient to cope with modern warfare, and even fell far short of the ordinary needs of any war.</p>
<p>How was our army deployed? Because the headquarters wanted to defend the long border, it distributed its forces in a narrow strip from Dunkirk to Monden. This lateral deployment was still the method of defending against the enemy that was passed down from the first European war in 1914. At that time, because the enemy did not have enough troops to break through the French line, they were able to hold their ground and not retreat. However, those who have always been good at using troops have recognized that the extension of the defense line and the dispersion of forces are very dangerous. They unanimously advocated the use of depth deployment, allowing for the retention of a large number of mobile reserve forces, which could immediately rise up to counterattack and block the gaps in case the first line of defense was broken.</p>
<p>But in France in 1940, the number of officers and soldiers was extremely lacking, and the so-called mobile reserve force was virtually non-existent. The elite of the French army had all been deployed to the border defenses. If the enemy could break through the defense line, they could drive straight in, as if splitting bamboo. As the enemy advanced, they would of course pass through countless villages, but who would defend and resist? In the war of 1914, the attacking army advanced slowly, at most a few kilometers per day, and was easily attacked due to the protruding line. This concept of frontal attack had already taken root in people's hearts, so no one had ever thought about how to defend Duwa, Vervins, Arbresville, or Amiens.</p>
<p>The colonels responsible for defending these many places were kind and amiable, and worthy of being elders, even though they were on the front lines. They had long been demobilized, and once the war broke out, even if they were ordered to take command again, they would only think of themselves as reserves. These loyal bureaucrats, although well-read in military books, had probably never dreamed of how to deal with enemy tanks or mechanized units equipped with machine guns.</p>
<p>These villages and towns were just behind the front line and were connected by railways, which were the "transportation lines" of the French army, making the situation even more serious. The British army could be supplied by the railway lines of Amiens, Arras, Duwa, and Les-Rees, and in an emergency, it could also use the Arbresville-to-Boloye line. But once these two lines were cut, the front-line troops would inevitably be completely isolated from the base. The French army's food, equipment, and military supplies were stored in Le Havre, Chateauroux, Nantes, and other places, and the forward military supply stations were in Arbresville, Saint-Paul, and Arras. What would happen if the enemy broke through the front line and disrupted the transportation between the army and the military stations? Obviously, within a few days, they would run out of ammunition and food and be captured. What precautions did the headquarters take against this danger? What measures were taken to defend against attacks not from the front but from the flanks? To put it bluntly, there was nothing at all.</p>
<p>If the British and French were determined to take a gamble and entrust the fate of the two countries to the front-line soldiers, then this defense line must be defended to the end at all costs. Even if it was not very strong, there was still a defense line. The large dredgers brought from Britain in March and April had been working on digging tank traps in the British front line, which was quite different from the situation in October 1939. But this eight months of hard work to build defenses and fortresses was abandoned as soon as the enemy launched an attack, taking the risk of fighting in the field. Wasn't this the stupidest thing in the world?</p>
<p>I once heard Cameline say, "In this war, the one who steps out of the air-raid shelter first will face greater danger..." So his unfortunate sortie was perhaps due to political reasons, and not out of his own will. Of course, this move had been in preparation for a long time. I saw the General Staff spending nine months planning and researching how to "advance into Belgium" and carefully drafting the order to advance, hoping to gain a five-minute advantage when the King of Belgium asked for help. They calculated that Belgian resistance would enable the Allied forces to occupy the Antwerp-to-Namo line in time. Giraud's army will break into Breda. But the Germans had already understood the Allied forces' counter-offensive against the Belgian invasion, and we had unknowingly practiced it once within their sight.</p>
<p>The fact is this. One day, a German plane suddenly landed in Belgian territory. The plane was carrying German General Staff personnel, who had with them the entire plan for advancing into Belgium on a certain day. The people in the plane pretended to be panicked and tried to burn the documents, but deliberately delayed the time so that our army could obtain them. As a result, the British army immediately made preparations, from No. 3 to No. 2 to No. 1. The final order was to prepare to depart within two hours. The army began to move, and all the reserve forces arrived at the front line. German reconnaissance planes flew overhead and recorded everything they saw. The German General Staff, seeing that this outdated and obvious strategy could actually work, were both overjoyed and surprised!</p>
<p>At this time, the Germans naturally held their ground, and Belgium naturally did not ask for help. Therefore, our army wasted a lot of gasoline and returned to its original defense. However, Mr. MacFarlane, the director of British military intelligence, was well aware of the German trick. Among the British, he was the only one who was pessimistic about this matter. He still firmly believed in the German attack on Holland and Belgium. He said, "There are still 110 German divisions in the Aix-la-Chapelle area, and they are not stationed there for no reason."</p>
<p>On May 11, the British army entered Belgium, and I followed. In the quaint and charming small towns and in the tidy villages, door to door, women held flowers and gave them to the soldiers. A British war correspondent described this triumphal march in faithful detail but was awakened by a telegram from the newspaper: "Please talk less about flowers and provide more facts." He could obey this order without much effort, because the next day, the flowers were gone and the facts had hit him cruelly.</p>
<p>The women in the Belgian villages were still standing door to door, just anxiously looking up at the sky. But until this time, the damage caused by German planes was not much. Only a few houses in the village had been destroyed. In my opinion, this bombing was negligible. I was wrong.</p>

<p>Conversations on the European War (Book 1)</p>
<h3>The Cause and Effect of Italy's Defeat</h3>
<p>After General Badoglio resigned, his successor was General Cavallero, a person of considerable reputation. At the end of the European War, he attended the Versailles Peace Conference, personally organized the Blackshirt Legion, served as the Chief of the Army Department, and had close ties with the German military authorities.</p>
<p>Cavallero is now in charge of military affairs at a time when Italy's situation is at its most difficult. Not only is the war situation in Albania unfavorable, but there have also been many setbacks on other fronts. When Mussolini joined the war last May, he did not clearly understand the strength of his navy and air force. Its army, apart from occupying a barren piece of British Somaliland in East Africa, has no significant military achievements. The army under General Graziani, stationed on the Egyptian border with the goal of attacking the Suez Canal, is now being defeated step by step by the British navy, army, and air force.</p>
<p>Italy's food and oil supplies have also been affected by the British naval blockade. Rice and flour have long been subject to rationing. The authorities have also ordered that farmers who refuse to store grain in public warehouses will be punished. The atmosphere in Rome is one of panic, and rumors are rife.</p>
<p>From the time Hitler invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, until Italy invaded Greece on October 28, 1940, every offensive by the Axis powers was successful, making the power of the totalitarian regimes temporarily illustrious beyond compare. When the Italian army attacked Greece, although the British side called it "Mussolini's Miscalculation," Italy may not have paid attention at the time, but the result was indeed fulfilled.</p>
<p>This spring, Germany and Italy may launch a new offensive in the Near East, but the Balkan countries, such as Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, have decided not to be bound by the Axis powers, and Turkey is also prepared to resist aggression. In addition, the rugged terrain of the Balkan Peninsula is not suitable for large-scale warfare. The irregularity of the roads, the scarcity of railways, and the obstacles of towering mountains are all unsuitable for mechanized warfare, something that Germany had already become familiar with during the previous European War.

<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Sold in Early Morning, Suddenly Tightening Near Noon</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market situation: HSBC's listing at 9:00 AM suddenly showed a longer British exchange rate of 1/25, at 5.25 yuan. The British exchange rate remained flat. Other exchange rates such as Dutch and Japanese also eased. As for the domestic market, the morning opening until noon was quite strong. Speculators were suppressed by the afternoon winds of yesterday. The number of export-dated US exchange rates was still huge, and the Yokohama Specie Bank also sold. The closing price for this month's US dollar was 5.375 yuan, and even cheaper for the next month, with prices as low as 5.34375 yuan. However, before noon, the rumors became more intense, with reports that the three major Chinese banks in this city would move into the British concession, causing speculation and withdrawal rumors. As a result, people were apprehensive and speculators stopped buying. In fact, the head office of the three major Chinese banks had already moved out, leaving only branch offices. Therefore, even if the Hong Kong address changed, what would that have to do with foreign exchange? It was merely speculators stirring up trouble. Before long, the authorities clarified that the rumors were false, but the market had already been disrupted. Until the noon close, the market was volatile. As a result, the spot US exchange rate was again far from 5.3125 yuan, with current orders at 3/8 and 3/7/5. Compared to the previous day, the British exchange rate contracted by 0.015625 and the US exchange rate tightened by 0.03125.</p>

<p>In the early morning, the London major rates for both near and far terms were flat, the New York silver price remained flat, the London gold price remained fixed, the exchange rate of British to US remained unchanged, to Shanghai fell 0.0625, US to British remained unchanged, to Shanghai rose 5 cents, and to France there were no quotes. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 3/8 and 3/9/0625 for British gold and 5.34375 yuan for the US exchange rate, the same as the previous day's closing prices. After opening, the market was stable. Before long, speculators, continuing the selling sentiment from the previous afternoon, continued to sell a large number of near and far-term US exchange rates, and the price hardened. It is estimated that foreign banks absorbed the bulk of this month's US exchange rate at 5.375 yuan, and Japanese banks such as the Yokohama Specie Bank also had positions waiting to be sold, making the market even more loose. It is estimated that foreign banks took in the Yokohama Specie Bank's February US exchange rate at 5.34375 yuan. Therefore, HSBC's listing at nine o'clock suddenly lengthened, with British flat and US strong by 1/25, changing the rate to 5.25 yuan. Other exchange rates such as Dutch and Japanese also loosened at the same time. Around 11:30, rumors suddenly arose in the market that the three major Chinese banks in this city would move into the British concession, leading to withdrawal rumors. As a result, people were agitated and speculators turned around to buy, and the momentum weakened in an instant. The three banks' authorities bought in to clarify, so the market became unstable. However, speculators had already settled the February US exchange rate for Chinese banks on the mainland at 5.3125 yuan. Until the close, the February price for the US exchange rate could only be settled at 5.25 yuan. The spot and current month US exchange rates were both 5.3125 yuan, with current spot prices at 3/8 and 2/7/5 and next month at 3/8 and 3/4/375. Compared to the previous day's closing price, the central bank's spot gold was tighter for the current month by 0.015625, and contracted for next month by 0.03125. The US exchange rate for both forward and spot was softer by 0.03125. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Rates Unchanged</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 18th (Saturday) Telegram. The exchange market opened flat this morning. British, US and Japanese exchange rates were all unchanged. (Spot US exchange rate closed yesterday at 23.625 yuan.) The Shanghai exchange rate for spot fell by one yuan to 442 yuan. (Yesterday's close was 443 yuan.) It was reported flat at 11:30. The Shanghai exchange rate for spot fell back by one yuan to 441 yuan, and the rest remained unchanged. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Tianjin British and American Rates Both Lengthened</p>
<p>Tianjin, 18th (Saturday) Telegram. The exchange market opened flat this morning. The London telegraphic transfer rate hardened by 0.03125 to 3 pence 6875. The New York exchange rate also lengthened by 0.03125 to 5.78125 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by 5 cents to 91.75 yuan. The "Joint Currency" black market was up 7.5 cents to 82 yuan.</p>
<h3>Speculation is Rampant: The Gold Market Initially Fell, Then Rose</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market in both open and black markets was volatile. It first fell, then rose again. The 6,800 yuan mark was broken several times, then immediately retreated. This was because of rumors that Chinese banks such as the Bank of Communications in this city were moving from the French Concession to the Public Concession, and speculators took the opportunity to spread rumors that they were withdrawing from the city. In fact, even if the address changed, it had nothing to do with the gold market, which agitated the already stabilized hearts of all parties. Therefore, although the securities firms were keen to sell, the remittance houses such as Sun Fung and others turned to sell, and the dealers such as Tong Kang, Tian Cheng, Yi Li, He Cheng Bao Kang, and Xiang He competed to buy (to cover their shorts). Therefore, the price retreated to 6,760 yuan, but at noon it soared to 6,880 yuan, eventually settling at 6,863 yuan, up 61 yuan. Based on the February forward US exchange rate closing price of 5.25 yuan, the settlement price was 6,655 yuan, an increase of 208 yuan. The half-day transaction volume totaled 89,000 taels. The swap to the February term was offered by the buyer to the seller at around 210 yuan. The cash price was sold by Feng Xiang to Yi Li at 20 taels, with a price 65 yuan lower than the forward delivery price. Ornaments and customs gold were both flat. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Rose Strongly by 61 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) was initially very stable. The market opened at 9:15, at 6,820 yuan, 18 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. Xiang Xing Yong Bank, remittance houses, and securities houses came to sell, and the price immediately fell by 35 yuan, falling within 6,800 yuan, and down to 6,785 yuan. Xin Yuan and others strongly pushed, raising the price to around 6,800 yuan. When it was heard that the US dollar was strengthening and that 5.375 yuan could be obtained for the current month, Defu and others became even more eager to sell. The low price of 6,760 yuan was seen. He He suddenly came to cover his shorts, and the two Qian Zhuang, Bao Kang and Tian Cheng, immediately bought, and the market soared again to over 6,800 yuan. At 1:15, rumors suddenly arose, and foreign exchange also softened amid speculative buying. He Cheng, Tong Kang, Xiang Xing, Yong Xin, and Feng all bought, and the rising momentum suddenly sharpened, soaring to 6,885 yuan. Xin Yuan securities firms continued to sell, and Yi Li came to sell. The price retreated twice to 6,840 yuan. In the end, because people were bullish, the price rose by over 20 yuan. The market closed at noon at 6,863 yuan, a rise of 61 yuan. After the close, it rose again to 6,875 yuan. There was a fluctuation of 125 yuan in half a day. There was also no market in the afternoon on Saturday. The cash shops' own brand gold was sold at a price 40 yuan lower than the forward delivery price, and the purchase price was 40 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no market for the current bid gold, and there was still no price.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Still Has No Market, Still No Price</p>
<p>The selling price of silver building ornamental gold per tael, both Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang still listed at 690 yuan, with a reduction of 30 yuan for purchases, it is said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Also Become Stronger</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw open market prices trending upward again. British and American gold pounds also rose by one yuan each. British gold notes remained fixed as before, and the market price remained flat. American gold notes initially retreated to 18.51 yuan, but soon rose again. In the afternoon, it rose as high as 18.80 yuan, eventually settling at 18.75 yuan, an increase of 15 cents compared to the previous day. Demand for Hong Kong notes remained strong, and the market price continued to rise. There was a slight supply of Japanese gold notes, and the market price softened slightly. The evening market price was 1.58 yuan. The supply and demand for Korean notes were even, and the market price remained flat. The evening market price remained at the original price of 1.22 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds Flourish, Unparalleled</h3>
<p>Public Bonds: The market only traded for half a day yesterday morning, and the market was closed in the afternoon. From now on, trading will be conducted every Saturday morning at 11:00 AM, so that settlements can be made on the same day. Weekly trading will be settled on the following Monday. The market continued to surge, going smoothly all the way. Type C broke through 70 yuan, then broke through 71 yuan. Type E also broke through 70 yuan. Type B and Type E have both broken through the legal limit price after 8/13, the former with a limit price of 73.5 yuan, now seen at 74.8 yuan, and the latter with a limit price of 70 yuan, now seen at 70.03 yuan. What this newspaper said before about Type C at 70 yuan not being the end has already been proven by facts. However, the current market trend is probably not something that a small number of shorts can stop. After 8/13, the government-issued public bonds have not been seen circulating in the market. Not only have there been no publicly issued mobile prices in the past three and a half years, but the originally unified public bonds, those moved within the spot market, account for the absolute majority. Those circulating in Shanghai are extremely limited. In the most recent year or so, the amount of investment and income received by the financial sector and capitalists of all sizes has been extremely considerable. Recently, the silver and money industry has absorbed a large amount of money, providing limited goods for unlimited needs. Therefore, the market's bargaining chips are becoming increasingly depleted, and the market price is rising excessively. The future cannot be viewed with ordinary eyes or simple common sense. Various situations contribute to the rise of public bonds. Logically speaking, the fundamental and important reason is the flood of floating capital in Shanghai. Therefore, its rise is a matter of course. At yesterday's opening, Juxin, Datong, and Xie Kang were the first to rush in, with Type C opening at 70 yuan. Thereafter, Delong, Wuhe, Hongda, Dingkang, and No. 16 all bought in. Although No. 7, No. 25, and Tong Kang all came out, they still could not suppress its flourishing spirit. Type B and E were seen breaking through the legal limit price, and various types were also seen at new highs. As a result, the increase ranged from 1.3 yuan to 2.1 yuan, with Type A increasing the least. The transaction volume for half a day was 2.5 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 50 shares of the First Factory of Great Success were traded at a price of 19 yuan flat.</p>
<p>London, 7th (Friday) Telegram: Today's listed market prices for Chinese foreign debt and stocks of East Asian British companies remained flat. Only the stocks of Mercantile Bank rose by another 2 shillings and 6 pence, at a price of 8 pounds 12 shillings and 6 pence. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Wanted to Fall But Stopped</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially weakened and then recovered, but the trend returned to fluctuating instability. The sentiment in the market was mixed, but after inquiries, the majority were still bullish. However, actual transactions were extremely scarce. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse was cheaper than the factory order by 50 yuan per bale. However, the consensus view was that foreign exchange would contract and gold prices would rise, which also meant that cotton yarn was expected to rise. Therefore, the amount of investment dragged in by securities firms and gold dealers increased daily, and the market felt more consolidated, and a small fall would lead to a rise. The high price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,444 yuan, and the low was 1,425 yuan. Today, 635 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning with a flat outlook. The opening price was 1,435 yuan. Then, it was heard that foreign exchange was quiet and hardened. At the same time, the spot yarn sales market was not smooth, and the market situation was loose, falling to 1,425 yuan. Unexpectedly, near 12 o'clock, rumors suddenly arose in the market, saying that exchange rates would contract and gold prices would rise again. Speculators' buying momentum suddenly intensified, and the price suddenly rose to 1,444 yuan. The closing price was 1,442 yuan. The half-day trading volume was 6,060 bales. The amount bought by each group is divided.</p>
<h3>Fine Lint Demand is Very Good</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is still that 41-count and 32-count raw materials are popular, and the prices are high. The 20-count raw materials have seen a large number of Indian cotton arrivals recently, and the selling price is lower and not as popular as the 42-count. As for foreign factories, they are all directly purchasing from overseas.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market, initially due to purchases by peers, and then due to the settlement by all parties, the market situation was firm but very uneven. As a result, compared to the previous day's closing price, the spot price alone rose by 12 points, and the rest varied by 1-2 points. Indian cotton was weak. Yesterday, including predictions, the price was 2 rupees lower.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trading, being the end of the year, and also because cotton prices have become popular and exchange rates have contracted, all parties are taking a wait-and-see attitude, and intentions are gradually fading. It is expected that the period of competition will have to wait until the beginning of spring.</p>
<h3>Talking Shop in the Yarn Market: Opening Up the Rise and Fall of Yarn Prices</h3>
<p>This year's yarn market, initially declined. The price of 20-count Double Horse fell from 1,435 yuan to 1,334 yuan on January 7. Then, it was attacked by rumors and rose sharply to 1,459 yuan on the 17th of this month, an increase of 125 yuan from the low price. It is conceivable that the recent fluctuations in the yarn market have been enormous. The following is a brief description of the trading materials on the market between the bulls and the bears:</p>
<p>(1) The bulls believe that the margin price is high, the swap price is expected to rise, and the foreign exchange is expected to contract. Therefore, they did not care about everything and rushed out to drag in goods. As a result, the trend of Double Horse rose straight up.</p>
<p>(2) The bears say that the current year is coming to an end, actual sales are stagnant, and the inland areas are severely punishing those who hoard goods. The yarn price in Sichuan is not good. Secondly, because the raw materials of yarn factories are cheap, the net profit of each piece of 20-count yarn is over 200 yuan. Therefore, thinking about the business direction, they will naturally open long-term yarn orders. According to investigations, the amount of long-term orders opened by the Sino-British factories in the most recent ten days is 15,000 bales. However, most of them are in the February and March futures. Those who accept them are currently profitable and there is no problem.</p>
<p>(3) The current yarn market is vastly up and down, and the waves are raging. It is all due to the enthusiasm of speculators. The trend of rises and falls is dramatic. The root cause is still the abundance of floating capital. In addition, the newly established small silver houses have been thriving recently and can collect and deliver goods on behalf of customers. Such changes are even more unpredictable. (Mountain)</p>
<h3>Grain: The End of the Period is Near, Foreign Rice Plummets, Hoarders Seek to Sell, Foreign Firms Offer Small Lots</h3>
<p>A large amount of foreign rice arrived yesterday, and hoarders are selling out in droves at the end of the year. In addition, foreign firms are offering small lots of March rice at only 82-83 yuan. February Saigon No. 1 is only 90.05 yuan. Because of the large number of orders in recent days, no less than 600,000-700,000 before and after, and most orders are for February and March, importers dare not consult again. Therefore, those holding goods are panicking and want to sell early. As a result, spot and futures prices are falling across the board. The market stabilized slightly later as some retail investors took advantage of the low prices to absorb. However, the result was a loss of about one yuan for spot and one and a half yuan for futures. The opening price for spot rice was 90 yuan for No. 1 Saigon in February, 90 yuan for rice on the road, 85.7 yuan for small batch rice in January 12, 82.5 yuan for January 16, and 12 yuan for February. Over 600 tons were offered, with 4,000 bags of spot rice.</p>
<p>In other news about foreign rice, a large batch arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Guangdong Wheel brought 4,568 bags from Siam, and 1,500 white bags from Hong Kong, for a total of over 6,000 bags. It arrived at the port at around 8:00 yesterday morning. The Qiongzhou Wheel also brought 5,217 bags from Hong Kong and arrived in Shanghai at noon yesterday. Both ships stopped at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession to unload. As for the Jardine Matheson Company's Fusheng Wheel, which arrived in Shanghai on the 16th, bringing 17,114 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, it docked at the Shun Tai Wharf in Hongkou and unloaded the foreign rice. It then moved to the Roosevelt Wharf on the evening of the 17th to load export goods and is scheduled to sail south to Hong Kong today. It is said that a large amount of Burmese foreign rice, over 100,000 bags, is currently being loaded in Yangon and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the beginning of the month. (Zu)</p>
<p>The arrival of thick and thin Japonica and other domestic rice varieties is scarce and sales are sluggish, resulting in a similar supply and demand situation, and the market is neither prosperous nor declining. It is estimated that Changbang's unique Japonica rice is still priced at 107-108 yuan, Kunshan's white Japonica rice is priced at 105-102 yuan, and Qingjiao's thin rice is priced at 98.5 yuan, or about 97 yuan.</p>
<p>The glutinous rice market has once again become a situation of anxiety. Both supply and sales are clean, and the market lacks change. The prices asked are not much higher or lower than before, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Rice Problem</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Translated from the Continental Daily</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that there is currently a serious problem that the authorities are eager to suppress, which is to alleviate the fear of rice shortages. People in the business community believe that if the authorities fail to take urgent measures, the price of rice will reach a peak of 150 yuan per dan after the New Year. This kind of prediction, based on past situations, is not an exaggeration. Looking back at the year 1940, which we will soon leave behind, according to the statistics of the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department, at the end of 1939, the prices of Du rice and Xian rice were 39.5 yuan and 36.8 yuan per dan, respectively. This figure is three times higher than the 10 yuan per dan in 1936. In the early stages of 1940, the price of rice did not rise significantly, and there were still reasons for optimism. However, the rise in prices has inevitably led to a higher cost of living, and millions of residents are facing serious problems. In mid-April, the highest price of rice was 41 yuan per dan, and the price of Xian rice did not increase much, so the citizens were not yet panicked. However, in early summer, an abnormal situation immediately appeared, and the highest price of Du rice reached 60 yuan, an increase of 50% compared with April. There are many reasons for this. Such as: (1) It was the time when the old and new crops were not yet available, and the stock was usually reduced. (2) There was a shortage of rice and grain around Shanghai. (3) Some people in the rice-producing areas stepped up purchases for military use. (4) The situation in French Indochina suddenly became tense due to the Japanese naval exercises. (5) Rice hoarding. These situations reappeared in mid-October, with the highest price reaching 70 yuan per dan. At the end of October, the price of French currency rose, causing the rice price to weaken slightly. However, it continued to rise from November onwards. It was even worse in December. By the end of the year, Du rice was close to 100 yuan, and most of the citizens were eating foreign rice. In addition to the above-mentioned factors, the reasons for the increase in rice prices are said to include: (1) Japan controls rice exports in rice-producing areas. (2) Increased difficulties in importing Saigon rice. (3) Hoarding and manipulation by unscrupulous merchants.</p>
<p>Regarding Japan's control of rice exports in rice-producing areas, the primary purpose is to relieve the rice shortage in Japan, and the secondary purpose is speculation. In the past year, there have been no accurate statistics on how much rice has been shipped to Japan. The Customs Administration often cannot consult on all rice transported to Japan by warships. However, according to rough estimates, at least 6 million dan of rice were transported to Japan in 1940. This statistic is based on what the rice-producing areas could produce in 1940. The amount of rice transported to Shanghai is less than this amount. Japanese merchants, just like the Chinese and foreign merchants here, are good at using keen methods to speculate in rice and hoard it, hoping for huge profits. The international community knows that there are two Japanese companies that almost monopolize the rice industry. Their speculative manipulation not only made Du rice in Shanghai increasingly scarce, but also limited the selling price of rice in the occupied areas, so they doubled their profits in a blink of an eye.</p>
<p>In any area occupied by the Japanese army, they immediately started to control food. In the past three years, Japanese merchants have made at least 100 million yuan in profits from controlling rice. Before 1940, Shanghai rice merchants could still directly transport rice from rice-producing areas, and could obtain a passport after contacting the Japanese. However, after the Japanese army tightened its control, it no longer issued passports. And the only source of Du rice seen on the Shanghai market is the farmers and small rice merchants who take risks to transport it back and forth, not afraid of being arrested. The tense situation in Annam has made the import of Saigon rice increasingly difficult, but in terms of quantity, the amount of rice imported by rice merchants in the past year has not decreased, and has even increased. Therefore, it is difficult to establish the claim that the high price of rice is due to the lack of rice. According to statistics, based on the situation in the first ten months of last year, the total amount of foreign rice imported throughout the year exceeded 3.77 million dan, with an average of 310,000 dan per month. The amount imported in October alone reached 1.3 million dan. Therefore, the total number for the year may exceed the 800,000 dan imported throughout 1939.</p>
<h3>Flour Market is Flat</h3>
<p>The current flour market is trending toward balance. The sales of flour by local customers are moving but not smooth. However, the supply of Hua factory's cheap flour is only half of what it used to be, and the source from Hong Kong is also unsustainable. There is not much left of the Lan Mark flour and other flours shipped from Hong Kong before, so it seems difficult to be bearish. In the early morning, over 3,000 bags of Hua Wu brand Australian flour were traded, with the price easing from 24.5 yuan to 4 cents. Over 1,000 bags of Lan Mark flour at 24.3 yuan to 2.5 cents were also bought by local customers. The market traded flat later, and the market has entered a state of hovering. Hua factory sold over 4,000 bags, and the price remained at 21.5 yuan, plus miscellaneous expenses. Foreign wheat flour continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Qiongzhou Wheel, in addition to bringing a large amount of foreign rice, also brought 6,800 bags of foreign wheat flour from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Wheat trading remains confined. During the period of lack of supply, neither Hua factories nor Japanese factories have spot goods to receive. In addition, it is the end of the year, and all industries are preparing to close, so although there is a asking price in the market, there is no proper market.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Japanese Merchants Frequently Dump Consolidated Oil, Prices Fall by About One Yuan, Transactions Only Handled by Retail Investors</h3>
<p>Yesterday's oil market presented a closing scene. Major players rarely entered or exited, and only retail investors had some dealings. The market was tired because Japanese merchants frequently dumped consolidated oil, and soybean oil was down nearly a yuan compared to the previous day. The stationing oil barely stood. A total of 80 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded in the unified market, with prices ranging from 121 yuan to 120.05 yuan. Another 100 barrels were traded for the lower February term at a price of 124 yuan, 30 barrels of Japanese factory soybean oil at a price of 99 yuan, 50 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil at a price of 99 yuan, 120 pieces of Yantai raw oil at a price of 97.5 yuan, 50 barrels of Qingdao raw oil at a price of 137 yuan, and 50 barrels of Tianjin raw oil at a price of 139 yuan. Today, there are 1,380 bags of soybeans, 2,470 pieces of soybean cake, 100 bags of sesame seeds, and 300 sesame oil cans shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Recovers</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market was stable yesterday, and the black market suddenly turned bullish in the afternoon. This was because most people were bullish, the current futures market remained healthy, and after the floating goods in the hands of the brokers came out, the market recovered. The selling of white cloth was flat, and bleached and dyed cloth rose by 2.5 to 5 cents per bolt. There are over 600 pieces of spot goods for current terms in this street, over 100 pieces of flannel and bleached cloth for the Zhejiang gang, and over 300 pieces of colored twill, khaki, and blue cloth for the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs. There are over 4,000 bolts of bleached cloth and printed cloth handled by overseas firms in Luo and Singapore. 1,820 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong on the 19th. The cloth market was stable in the morning, but suddenly tightened at noon. The closing price of Longtou fine cloth was 45.89 yuan. However, in the black market trading among peers, the price opened at 46.2 yuan. Longtou fine twill was 41 yuan, and other miscellaneous brands of fine cloth also rose across the board, with each bolt increasing by 8-9 cents.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics are Expected to Rise</h3>
<p>Woolen fabrics were still active yesterday, trading was brisk, and the market was very strong. Looking back at this time in previous years, the scene was very different. Both retail and wholesale business were quite smooth. The spring and summer fabric market did not decline. The Ningbo and Nanjing gangs increased their demand. Foreign firm overcoats and new fabrics were in high demand for orders. Negotiations on spot goods from overseas continued to close deals. The current orders for our factory's woolen fabrics were also strong. Because people expected higher prices, goods were scarce, and due to the lack and high cost of sources and raw materials, both open and black market prices rose firmly.</p>
<h3>Coal White Coal Both Expensive and Sought After</h3>
<p>Although sales of white coal have been quite slow recently, since the exchange rate has tightened, people expect higher prices. Both the formal and informal markets are trending upwards. Yesterday, Hongji white coal, handled by fellow traders, was priced at $260 per ton for lump coal, $250 per ton for small pieces, and $168 per ton for white coal dust. These prices are all ex-warehouse; delivery to the customer's home incurs additional handling fees.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous The Resurgence of Cigarette囤積戶</h3>
<p>The informal market for cigarettes has been tightening again in recent days. Due to financial contraction, speculators are active again, with囤積戶 vigorously absorbing supplies and searching the market. Fellow traders are holding tight and not selling, causing prices to rise. Yesterday, brands like "Great Britain" were priced at $1325, "Old Knife" at $965, "Pinhai" at $860, "Wuhua" at $663, "Little Fairy" at $655, "Ten-Stick Qianmen" at $346 per 10,000 sticks, and "Fifty-Stick Qianmen" at $352 per 10,000 sticks. Market prices are generally higher than last week. Domestically produced cigarettes are stable, with "Golden Mouse" at $450 and "Beautiful" at $700, an increase of over twenty dollars compared to regular trading.</p>
<h3>Salted Meat Annual Sales Reported to Rise</h3>
<p>Among salted goods, cured meat is currently in high demand as the Lunar New Year approaches, so its selling price has also increased. Yesterday, Fenglin meat was sold at $142 per dan (a unit of weight), an increase of over ten dollars since the Winter Solstice. Additionally, Jinhua's hometown meat from Zhejiang Province has recently increased by over ten dollars and is now selling for $140 per dan. Other items like tea legs and Xuefang Jiang legs are sold as gifts, so their prices have also increased significantly.</p>
<h3>Matches and Soap Prices Increase Steadily</h3>
<p>The match market remains highly sought after, with prices steadily rising in recent days. Due to issues with raw materials, factories are unwilling to sell large quantities. For example, "Beautiful" brand is selling for $400 per box, "Phoenix" brand for $390, second-class miscellaneous brands for $370, and third-class miscellaneous brands for $350.</p>
<p>The soap market has been active across various channels in recent days, with relatively smooth sales. Due to limited inventory, traders are unable to supply large quantities, leading to tight prices. For example, "Guben" soap is now selling for $24.80 per box, "Bai Xiangmao" soap for $13.50, and "Huang Xiangmao" soap for $13.</p>
<h3>Seafood Squid and Mushrooms Selling Well</h3>
<p>Both arrival and sales of squid are reported to be lively. Recently, over 400 pieces arrived in Shanghai and were immediately unloaded. Current market prices are between $175 and $170, nearly ten dollars higher than before, with a strong upward trend.</p>
<p>Due to sourcing difficulties, the arrival of domestic mushrooms is expected to be intermittent, while sales are brisk, creating a situation where demand exceeds supply. The selling price is generally $650 to $700 for regular grades, $800 to $850 for shiitake mushrooms, and up to $900 for the highest quality.</p>

<h3>New Tax Rates in Both Concessions Citizens Cannot Bear the Burden Special Meeting of Taxpayers Approaching Public Groups Determined to Appeal for Reduction</h3>
<p>The Public Concession's Municipal Council will convene a special meeting of taxpayers on the 23rd of this month to pass a 40% increase in property taxes and higher license fees for various items. The French Concession authorities have also followed suit with tax increases. The French Concession land tax, originally 8 per mille, now has a new tax rate including special surtaxes, increasing it to 16 per mille. The property tax, originally 15%, now has a new tax rate including special surtaxes, increasing it to 30%. Residents of both concessions feel they cannot bear the burden under high price pressures. With the special meeting of taxpayers approaching, all parties hope that consideration will be given to the people's capacity to pay, that the tax increase proposal will be seriously discussed, and that the public groups in the French Concession will appeal to the authorities to understand the difficult times and reduce or revise the new tax rates.</p>
<h3>Authorities Express Determination to Curb Prices</h3>
<p>A statement was released yesterday on the food supply situation over the past year. Although prices in this port have frequently risen due to sudden changes in the environment after the war, in reality, some speculators prioritize personal profit and disregard the well-being of the public, controlling prices and manipulating the market, which harms social order and affects the future of the country. In particular, rice, a necessity of life, has been monopolized by米蠢 (rice weevils), with prices rising again and again. Some have become immensely wealthy as a result, while others are suffering from hunger and cold. Our highest authorities once ordered the adjustment of goods in various regions to suppress market prices, and urged merchants to consider the overall situation and awaken quickly. As for the Public Concession Municipal Council, in view of this serious situation, if no immediate rescue measures are taken, the future is worrying. Therefore, in recent years, it has used various methods to curb high prices. Although the effect is not obvious, it still serves as a warning to unscrupulous merchants. Yesterday, the Municipal Council specifically released a statement on the supply of food and other items in this port over the past year, expressing its determination to maintain prices. The main points include strict prohibition of hoarding, mandatory labeling, prohibition of using exchange rates to raise prices, and the organization of a price investigation committee in cooperation with the French Concession. However, it does not advocate mandatory price limits. Regarding rice and food supply, it emphasizes opening up sources and storing sufficient grain, but is unwilling to force prices below cost. As for平糶 (government price control on rice), the 平糶 committee lost more than one million yuan in one year, benefiting the common people, which is commendable.</p>

The Political Department of the French Police has come forward to mediate, and there have been glimmers of hope, but they have faded again. In recent days, the workers have once again appealed to all sectors to uphold justice and provide material assistance. It is now learned that the hospital is willing to renegotiate. The French Consulate General is also paying close attention to this labor dispute and has begun sending personnel to investigate in order to resolve it as soon as possible. In other news, the Chinese Taxpayers' Committee of the French Concession held an emergency meeting at 2:30 p.m. yesterday to address the Guangci Hospital strike, to mediate and discuss solutions.

<p>New Clothing Employees</p>
<p>More than 500 employees from over 100 new clothing stores in the two concessions made demands to their employers for improved treatment on the 13th. The employers did not accept the demands, so the employees began a go-slow strike from the previous day. All new clothing stores were unable to operate. It is now learned that after a round of negotiations between labor and management, opinions are gradually converging. The employers are strongly urging the workers to return to work first and then negotiate again, so the labor dispute has eased.</p>
<p>Paint Workers</p>
<p>Due to the high prices of rice and other goods, paint workers throughout the city are finding it difficult to make a living and are demanding that their employers increase wages. After several rounds of mediation, no results have been achieved. A portion of the workers began a go-slow strike last night (the 18th).</p>
<h3>British Ship Fired Upon by Japanese Warship When Passing Wusong Estuary "Isomaler" Returns Company Asks Consulate to Intervene</h3>
<p>According to shipping industry sources, the British Marler Company's "Isomaler" set sail from Shanghai at around 5 p.m. on the 16th after loading cargo, intending to head to a seaport in Zhejiang Province. Unexpectedly, when it reached the Wusong Estuary that night, it was suddenly fired upon with machine guns by a Japanese warship anchored there.

The crew members on board were spared death or injury, but were nonetheless terrified. The ship has now returned and anchored on the Jiangmian River at the Sixteenth Pier. It is reported that the British captain has reported the detailed incident to the company authorities, who have asked the British Consulate to intervene with the Japanese side and demand an explanation for the motive behind the shooting.</p>
<h3>Date for Return of Goods Detained in Vietnam Has Not Yet Been Agreed</h3>
<p>Goods from our port's various factories being shipped to the mainland via Vietnam have been detained by the Vietnamese authorities due to the closure of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway for more than a month. It is now learned that the Vietnamese authorities have agreed "in principle" to return the detained goods. However, according to shipping industry sources, despite the Vietnamese authorities agreeing to return the goods, a large quantity of items has actually been confiscated, with losses estimated at hundreds of thousands of yuan. Our port's various factories are currently awaiting detailed telegrams from their representatives in Vietnam regarding the future of the negotiations. On the one hand, they are also establishing an office at the Yarn and Cloth Exchange on Avenue Edward VII to announce that the relevant industries should promptly proceed with registration procedures. A registration fee of ten yuan per ton of cargo is charged, and those who go to register there are very enthusiastic. Once the date for the return is fully agreed upon, transportation steps will be carried out. It is believed that this matter can be completely resolved within this month.</p>

<h3>Regarding New Notes, the Business Community Has a Strict Position, a Firm and Consistent Attitude of Non-Promotion</h3>

<h3>Saving New Year's Eve Dinner to Help Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Zhenhai Fellow Villagers Association's Disaster Relief Donation Committee received a letter from Le Genbao, a fellow villager living in Shanghai, stating that at this time of year, when the old year is coming to an end, every family has a New Year's Eve dinner. Traditional customs dictate that it is a common banquet, but at a time when the disaster situation in their hometown is severe, with hundreds of thousands of disaster victims crying out for food, how can they bear to hear the disaster victims crying for hunger and still have pointless banquets? Therefore, he is transferring the funds for the New Year's Eve dinner to aid disaster relief, and he is appealing to his friends and fellow villagers, which has gained much sympathy. A total of one thousand yuan has been collected from saving New Year's Eve dinner funds, including 300 yuan from Le Genbao, 200 yuan from Hu Zongshen, 200 yuan from Shuai Jun, 150 yuan from Qian Xuefan, 100 yuan from Gan Rusheng, 50 yuan from Lou Dixing, and 50 yuan from Cai Wei. It is believed that among the Zhenhai fellow villagers living in Shanghai, there are many enthusiastic people who will surely step forward enthusiastically.</p>
<h3>Overview of Important Administrative Matters of the Municipal Council Over the Past Year (2)</h3>
<p>Transfer of Files</p>
<p>Regarding the files of the former Land Office held by this Council, the Municipal Government has repeatedly requested their transfer. Therefore, on July 5th, the above-mentioned files were transferred to the Japanese Consul General.</p>
<p>Several newspapers were ordered to suspend publication or were warned for publishing text that could exacerbate the situation in this port.</p>
<p>Additional Taxes</p>
<p>The continued devaluation of the national currency has caused many financial difficulties for this Council. Subsequently, in accordance with Item 7 of the proposal passed by the annual meeting of taxpayers, public bonds of 16 million yuan were issued to meet emergency needs. At the same time, starting from July 1st, a 50% surcharge was implemented on additional taxes to increase income. Although income has increased, the estimated amount of losses for the previous year is still considerable. As for the various austerity measures taken, please see other parts of the annual report for details.</p>
<p>Strike</p>
<p>On November 29th, a portion of the Chinese police officers went on strike due to dissatisfaction with the rice subsidy and housing subsidy measures. Subsequently, Mr. Yu Qiaqing and Deputy Police Commissioner Yao worked hard to mediate, so the unrest quickly subsided.</p>
<p>West Shanghai Blockade</p>
<p>On the 30th of the same month, a Japanese military police officer was shot on Great West Road in West Shanghai. After the incident, the Japanese military police headquarters implemented a blockade in the area around Great West Road and Yuyuan Road, which caused great inconvenience to the residents of the area, and the supply of food was also blocked. During the blockade, the China General Omnibus Company and the Shanghai Electric Construction Company were prevented from operating buses and trolleybuses in the area. At the same time, there were unauthorized buses operating in the area. Subsequently, this Council sent a letter to the Consular Body to negotiate, and the Police Commissioner directly negotiated with the Japanese military police commander in order to ease the blockade restrictions. Regarding the infringement of public transportation special operating rights and the requirement for rickshaw pullers to apply for Chinese licenses, the Chairman of this Council also sent a letter to the Japanese Consul General to pay attention. Most of the above-mentioned blockade measures were only lifted on December 14th.</p>
<p>In addition, the Council's Fuel Committee has been paying close attention to the problem of coal and fuel. The arrival of domestic coal is extremely scarce, so the city's coal supply depends on foreign countries. However, due to exchange rates and shipping conditions, the selling price is extremely high.</p>
<p>Municipal Lottery</p>
<p>Last year, someone proposed to this Council to issue municipal charitable lottery tickets to alleviate this Council's burden in dealing with social welfare undertakings such as education, hospitals, refugees, and beggar relief. This Council considered the above-mentioned suggestion to be inconvenient to adopt. The biggest reason is the question of principle. Because this Council has long been determined to prohibit public gambling, the issuance of municipal lottery tickets, in addition to the above-mentioned problems, is also a major problem in terms of law. At the same time, this Council believes that this move would damage this Council's financial position and its credibility.</p>
<p>Daylight Saving Time</p>
<p>Last year, this Council cooperated with various relevant authorities to hold a daylight saving time campaign, which began at midnight on May 31st and ended at midnight on October 12th.</p>
<p>Bund Wharf</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the Bund Wharf usage method in August 1938, the results have been good. The above-mentioned method was reconsidered in June of last year, and the result was that it should continue to be implemented. However, the wharf usage fee was doubled starting from July 16th.</p>
<p>Population Survey</p>
<p>This Council used to survey the population within the boundary every five years. Last year was also the year for the survey, but in view of the sharp increase in the population within the boundary, the survey methods previously adopted could not be applied. In order to save expenses, it was postponed.</p>
<p>Employee Salaries At the time of last year's Taxpayers' General Meeting, the Council Chairman foreshadowed the need to investigate the salaries of the Council's employees. Since August of the previous year, prices in this city have continued to rise sharply. Since October of the previous year, in addition to the rice subsidies issued to general low-level Chinese employees, the Council has not increased the cost of living allowances for employees. The treatment of employees is far behind that of major commercial organizations, so many have resigned to take other jobs or are preparing to resign. In view of this, this Council decided to increase subsidies starting from May of last year. The method is that those who previously received a 35% subsidy will uniformly receive a 65% subsidy, and those who previously received a 40% subsidy will uniformly receive a 77% subsidy. It is estimated that the annual cost will be 4.45 million yuan. The above-mentioned subsidies were again increased to 85% starting from October, with the minimum amount set at 20 yuan. At the same time, rice subsidies were also increased. The annual expenditure must be increased by 2 million yuan. As the end of the year approaches, this Council deeply feels that it is necessary to reconsider the salary and benefits issues for all employees, especially the treatment of the Chinese police officers. The Chinese police officers expressed dissatisfaction with the current salary, resulting in unrest. This Council believes that this expression of dissatisfaction is a microcosm of considerable dissatisfaction among all employees. In order to maintain a sound administrative organization, this Council again increased the cost of living allowances for employees starting from November. The method is to give a 150% subsidy for the first 500 yuan of an employee's monthly salary, a 125% subsidy for the part of their monthly salary from 501 yuan to 1,000 yuan, and a 100% subsidy for the part of their monthly salary above 1,000 yuan. The minimum amount was changed to 40 yuan, and rice subsidies were also increased. It is estimated that the annual cost will be around 935,000 yuan. It is found that this Council's service is the same as other public utilities. As a result of this increase in allowances, there is no doubt that more must be taken from the citizens.

<h3>President Dai's Brilliance Inspires Nishikawa Unable to Reach Him Daily News Records Nishikawa's Conversation Overflowing with Admiration for Dai</h3>
<p>In order to connect and strengthen the feelings between China and various Buddhist nations, Examination Yuan President Dai Jitao, who has traveled to Myanmar, India, and other countries, has been warmly received wherever he goes. According to Nishikawa Isamu, an official of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, when Dai boarded a plane in Yangon on November 10th of last year to go to Calcutta, Nishikawa happened to be traveling to Myanmar and India for business and unexpectedly took the same plane, spending five hours sitting opposite Dai. When the plane landed in Calcutta, representatives from the local governor to the military and civilians were all present to welcome Dai. All newspapers regarded Dai and his party as state guests, recording the warm welcome in great detail. What made Nishikawa feel both ashamed and admiring was that Dai's attitude was dignified and he showed no animosity towards him, which was enough to represent the cultivation of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Warm and Gentle Gentleman, Highly Welcomed</p>
<p>Here is a brief translation of Nishikawa's conversation in Tokyo as published in the local Daily News: "I arrived in Yangon on November 6th of last year. At that time, Dai Tianchou and his party were already here. Dai was either welcomed by the people at meetings or meeting with the authorities every day. He was never idle. Until November 10th, I boarded a British BAC plane to go to Calcutta. When I entered the plane, I saw Dai and his party of eight were also on it. Dai is a fair-skinned man who is five feet tall and has a short beard. One look at him and you know that he is a warm and gentle gentleman. Although he knows that I am Japanese, he does not openly show his hostility. The flight from Yangon to Calcutta took about five hours. I only faced Dai in silence. I once considered trying to talk to Dai, but after much consideration, I finally did not. When the plane landed in Calcutta, those welcoming Dai at the airport, from the governor to many military and civilian representatives, had already gathered and waited. The welcomers placed wreaths on Dai's head and then led Dai into a car and went straight to the hotel."</p>
<h3>Gunshots in Front of Japanese-Chinese Yarn Factory Yesterday Morning Gunman Arrested</h3>
<p>At the beancurd stall in front of the Japanese-Chinese Fourth Yarn Factory on Robison Road in West Shanghai, at around 9 a.m. yesterday, a man was eating beancurd there, staying for a long time and seeming to be waiting for something. Before long, it was time for the office workers to come to the factory, and a Chinese man hurriedly entered the factory. The man eating the beancurd caught sight of him approaching, immediately pulled out a pistol, and fired two shots. At that time, a Japanese man, Ide Mitsuyama, who is the director of the accounting department of the factory, was also following behind, but neither of them were hit. The gunman immediately ran towards the Chinese area. At that time, the Si Ge (a type of police) chased after him and captured him on the spot, confiscating a live firearm. He was taken to the "Police Station" in West Shanghai.</p>
<h3>National Government Hopes Labor and Management Overcome Hard Times Together, Suppressing Prices and Regulating Freight Will Soon Be Implemented</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of war, various places have successively become war zones, and the transportation of essential goods has been sluggish, leading to imbalances in supply and demand. Speculators have manipulated prices, taking advantage of the situation for profit. The prices of various commodities have been soaring day and night, and the cost of living is higher than ever before. The average salaried class is unable to make ends meet, and the common people are starving, which has affected social order. Labor disputes and robberies have occurred frequently. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned yesterday from relevant departments in this city that the National Government authorities are actively planning to suppress prices and regulate freight transportation in various places, and plan to implement it in the near future, hoping to stabilize commodity prices and relieve the plight of the common people. On the one hand, it is hoped that both labor and management will cooperate and overcome the difficulties together, waiting for the completion of the war of resistance and construction, and the arrival of a bright future. They should not take any excessive actions that could be exploited by others, resulting in both sides suffering. On the other hand, it is still hoped that the employers will, within their means, appropriately increase the salaries of their employees to maintain their livelihoods and enable them to work with peace of mind, so that everyone can get what they need, and all disputes can be resolved peacefully.</p>

It is said that one of the letters instructed that the discarded coat and gown be donated to help the poor. It is not clear when this tragedy occurred. It is generally believed that he may have jumped into the pool to commit suicide after the park closed last night (the 17th).</p>
<h3>Four People with Suspicious Behavior, Pistols Confiscated, Claiming to be Plotting to Rob Gold Bars</h3>
<p>Huang Hairu and Sun Minchang, Chinese detectives from the Central Police Station, were patrolling near Ningbo Road and Henan Road at 11:00 a.m. the day before yesterday. At that time, they saw four men wandering around there, behaving suspiciously. The two detectives paid attention to the four men's actions for a full three-quarters of an hour and decided that these people were definitely not good people. However, because they were outnumbered, they did not dare to act rashly. Later, the detectives saw a squad of Chinese police coming and quickly went forward to ask for assistance. Then they went forward to search, and confiscated two pistols and ten bullets from two of them. They were taken back to the police station and interrogated. The suspects were identified as Wang Weilang (also known as Wang Er, from Jiangbei, the one who hid the gun), Li Bin (from Tianjin, the one who hid the gun), Yan Qi (from Suzhou), and Wang Gengsheng (from Jiangbei). They confessed that they had originally planned to wait for someone carrying gold bars to pass by and rob them. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the police station, stated that the defendant Li Bin had recently been detained on suspicion of theft and was released due to insufficient evidence. Now he has been arrested again, and further investigation is needed to request an adjournment for further questioning. Judge Chuan Lin ordered that they be detained pending further questioning.</p>
<h3>Arson Case, Husband and Wife Sentenced</h3>
<p>The Shixin Leather and Glove Factory at No. 6, Lane 36, Lloyd Road, had fire insurance of 40,000 yuan with the Xinhua Insurance Company. Recently, due to business losses, it was difficult to make ends meet. On the morning of the 11th, the factory owner, Hu Meifu, and his wife, Hu Xu, tried to set fire to the factory in order to obtain compensation. Unexpectedly, the fire was extinguished by the Daqing Yong Hotel next door immediately after it started. Wang Shanqing, a Chinese detective from the Laozha Police Station, investigated and confirmed the matter and arrested the Hu couple. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the police station, prosecuted them in the First Special Court according to law. The Hu couple also hired lawyer Qian Zheng to defend them. The trial has concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Chuan Lin announced the verdict, sentencing Hu Meifu to three years and six months in prison, and Hu Xu to one year and nine months in prison, with a two-year suspended sentence. He also stated the reasons, saying that the defendants' arson had been proven and they had confessed without hesitation. According to law, the sentence should be very severe. However, considering that Hu Meifu's actions were out of economic pressure, the sentence was specially reduced. As for Hu Xu's assistance in her husband's arson, it was also proven, but considering that it was also out of necessity and that she had young children to raise, the sentence was specially reduced and a suspended sentence was imposed. If they did not agree with the verdict, they could appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court within ten days.</p>
<h3>Fraudulent Collection of Large Sums for Cargo Transport</h3>
<p>Zhang Qiqia, manager of the Zhonghua Trading Company at No. 7 The Bund, recently planned to export a large quantity of goods. After the Japanese side banned the transport, Zhu Baoyu and Zhu Baolin, runners from the Shanghai Water and Land Transportation Company, contacted Zhang to arrange the transport, stating that the transport fee was 60,000 yuan. Zhang issued a promissory note for 40,000 yuan and a check for 20,000 yuan. However, after Zhu and others obtained the 40,000 yuan in cash, they did not transport the goods for Zhang. Zhang believed that Zhu Baoyu and others were suspected of fraud and reported to the Laozha Police Station. Detectives were dispatched to No. 64 Lloyd Road and arrested Zhu Baoyu. Based on his confession, Zhu Baolin was also arrested. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Fourth Criminal Court of the Special Court and requested to be detained. The defendants confessed that the 40,000 yuan had indeed been handed over to the Shanghai Water and Land Transportation Company.

<h3>Setting Up a False Company to Defraud Goods, Issuing Bad Checks, Liu Ziqing Created a Smokescreen, Arrested After Investigation</h3>
<p>Liu Ziqing, from Zhenjiang, used to work as a runner at the Anle Textile Factory at No. 1, Lane 439, Ningbo Road. At the beginning of this month, Liu told the factory that the Zhongyuan Company at No. 11, Jingxingli, Qipu Road, intended to purchase 12,061 yuan worth of cotton cloth. The factory handed over the goods to Liu for transportation, and Liu handed over four checks issued by the Zhongyuan Company in the factory for the price of the goods. Unexpectedly, the four checks were all rejected upon maturity. Anle reported to the Laozha Police Station, and under the investigation of Chinese detective Liu Junjie, it was found that the Zhongyuan Company, which was investigated, was very poorly equipped and had no responsible personnel. It was suspected that Liu was cheating, and it was learned that all the cotton cloth was gray fabric, which was difficult to sell in the market without dyeing. Therefore, inquiries were made to various dyeing factories. It was later found that the Zhongmei Dyeing Factory at No. 14, Lane 988, Chengdu Road, had received 1,000 pounds of cotton cloth from Liu Ziqing for dyeing. It was further found that the Yuandong Company at No. 10, Lane 12, Gellow Road, had also purchased 3,800 yuan worth of cotton cloth from Liu. This further proved that this transaction was entirely created by Liu alone. The so-called Zhongyuan Company was also a ruse created by Liu. After obtaining evidence, the detectives proceeded to arrest Liu. It was not until the day before yesterday that Liu Ziqing was arrested in Room 229 of the Yangzi Hotel on Yunnan Road. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Fourth Criminal Court of the Special Court. Fang Fushu, a lawyer from the police station, requested that he be temporarily detained for further investigation, as there were still some aspects of the case that needed to be investigated. After Judge Fei questioned Liu Ziqing, he ordered him to be detained and the trial adjourned for a week.</p>
<h3>Malfunctioning Car Parts, Old Woman Died in Misfortune</h3>
<p>Xu Sun, an old woman from Chuansha, 69 years old, who lived at No. 1, Lane 635, Julaida Road, was walking outside at 8:45 p.m. on the 17th. When she was crossing the road diagonally at No. 621 Julaida Road, a small car with license plate number 7742, driven by Qi Shengquan, a shareholder of Yongcheng Hardware Store from Ningbo, sped over and it was too late to retreat, causing her to be knocked down. She was injured in the head and died on the spot due to her old age. The police arrested Qi and the car and took them to the police station. The body was transported to the morgue. Yesterday, the body was claimed by the family for burial. The police station is investigating Qi Shengquan. It is reported that the defendant's car was inspected by the Vehicle Management Office yesterday and found that not only were there many damages to the brakes and other parts, but also that the driving was in violation of regulations, so the defendant's guilt is quite serious.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Having read the news report that the kidnappers were unfamiliar with driving and that the factory owner was lucky to escape danger, it is slightly inconsistent with the facts. No. F-1, Lane 1955, Jing'an Temple Road, is the address of the Shanghai Private Daonan Elementary School and there is no such person as Shen Haitao. It is believed that the rumor is untrue. For fear that the outside world does not understand the truth, we hereby declare this and hope that you will correct it. I hereby submit this and wish you peace. From Private Daonan Elementary School, January 18th.</p>
<p>Having read the report in your newspaper on January 17th about the kidnapping of Jin Fangduan, the content is slightly inconsistent with the facts. The Jin is a friend of our store and was not the owner. He came to the store to visit a friend at about 9:00 p.m. on the 13th and was kidnapped. We hereby inform you and respectfully request a correction. We are extremely grateful. Respectfully, Ruikang Shoes and Hats Store, January 17th.</p>

<h3>Scoto Cup Football Quarter-Finals: Tung Wah to Face West Bund This Morning; Fierce Battle at Yiyuan at 10:30 AM; You You to Face North West Children at Jiaozhou Park</h3>
<p>The Scoto Cup football competition is in its second week, and three matches will continue today. Tung Wah will face West Bund at Yiyuan at 10:30 AM this morning, with Kanaal as the referee. The two teams have not yet met in the league. West Bund has had an excellent record in this competition, losing only three matches, and their strength should not be underestimated. There have been slight changes in the Tung Wah lineup, with center-back Huang Kehou moved forward to play as left forward, Liang Shutang as center-back, and Zhang Zhaopeng filling Liang's position. Fei Chunhua will play as right forward, with Jia Youliang remaining on the right wing. Overall, the team's lineup is considered relatively complete, although the center-back line is slightly weak. However, with Li Yichen having left and Han Longhai unable to play due to injury, it is undoubtedly a loss for Tung Wah. They must be careful and fight to the end in today's match against West Bund. The other two matches are You You against North West Children and Jewish against St. Francis. The former will be played at Jiaozhou Park at 2:30 PM, with Chen Jixiang as the referee. You You has the assistance of Lido stars Zheng Tongyu, Zhang Lin'gen, Jiang Chao, and Sun Jinshun this year, making them no ordinary team. Although North West Children is a Division A team, they are ranked at the bottom in the Division A league, so their strength is about the same as You You's, and there will be fierce competition. As for the match between Jewish and St. Francis, it will be held at the Racecourse. In addition, all Chinese teams in the league are idle this round. The schedule is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Tung Wah Club—West Bund (Scoto) 10:30 AM Yiyuan</p>

<h3>Reserve Cup Football: Tung Wah Champion; Defeats Jewish 2-1</h3>
<p>In the final of the Western Union Football Reserve Cup, Tung Wah Club and Jewish Club clashed at Jiaozhou Park at 2:30 PM yesterday, with Zhang Le as the referee. In the first half, Tung Wah took the lead 1-0 with a goal from Lai Chen Yutian. In the sixth minute of the second half, Jewish's Di Fei tied the score. Later, Jewish's Lun Botuo handled the ball in the penalty area and was penalized with a penalty kick. Cai Shengsen scored, and cheers erupted. Tung Wah took the lead again. However, two minutes before the end of the match, Cai Shengsen, eager to save the ball, accidentally collided with Di Fei and was also penalized with a penalty kick. Jewish's Mei You took the shot, but Zhang Banglun was agile and saved it as a corner kick, turning danger into safety. Tung Wah then defeated Jewish 2-1 to win the championship. After the match, the vice president of the Western Union, Kang Baosi, presented the awards on the spot. Tung Wah's captain Shu Shigeng took the big silver cup, and all the team members received a small silver medal each. For a time, applause was thunderous, and two thousand fans were overjoyed. Both sides performed well in yesterday's match. Jewish's defense was not as good as their attack, and left winger Lai Fan was a dangerous player. Di Fei's goal was entirely due to this player. Zhang Dulun was the best player for Tung Wah, saving countless dangerous shots and calmly saving a penalty kick. He was the most meritorious. He Jiatong also performed well. The forwards and center-back line were average. The lineups of both sides in yesterday's match were as follows:</p>
<p>Tung Wah Club</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun</p>
<p>He Jiatong Hu Hanwen</p>
<p>Liu Guodong Cai Shengmiao Shu Shigeng</p>
<p>Sun Fang Zhang Zhaopeng Chen Yutian Gao Baozheng Liao Shiming</p>
<p>Jewish Club</p>
<p>Ke En</p>
<p>Lun Botuo En Qi'er</p>
<p>Nuonike An Boke Tangnas</p>
<p>R. Lai Fan G. Mei You Mike Lili Que Klaus Di Fei</p>
<p>The Fierce Battle's Course</p>
<p>Jewish kicked off and attacked first, but was blocked back by Tung Wah. After seven minutes, Gao Baozheng received support from the back line, sent it forward, and Chen Yutian waited for the right moment, lifted his foot, low and rapid, and went straight into the bottom of the net. Tung Wah opened the scoring first. Jewish refused to be outdone and launched a counterattack. Lai Fan advanced rapidly along the sideline, sending it to the center, Di Fei caught up with a kick, and then back to Lai Fan's feet, but unfortunately he was too hasty and missed. Tung Wah ordered a counterattack, Gao Baozheng headed the ball to Chen Yutian, Chen passed it to Zhang Zhaopeng, and Zhang shot on the spot, going over the crossbar. After a long period of fierce fighting, neither side achieved anything. Tung Wah goalkeeper Zhang Banglun moved four steps after catching the ball and was penalized with a free kick, but it was not successful. In short, Klaus got the ball and passed it to Lai Fan to shoot, but Zhang Banglun saved it as a corner kick. Lai Fan's corner kick came perfectly, and Zhang jumped to hit it out, and thus escaped the danger. The first half ended, with Tung Wah still leading 1-0. After the break, Jewish went all out to advance, and Tung Wah's penalty area was in trouble. Lai Fan pressed into the interior, kicked it in, Di Fei raised his foot and swept it, and bounced in from the crossbar. Zhang Banglun couldn't hold it down, and it was tied (1-1). However, Tung Wah's offensive did not diminish, and the forwards were still active, but the god of luck did not come, and they all missed the opportunity. Chen, the center forward, lost two good chances in front of the goal. After 30 minutes, Cai Shengsen inadvertently collided with Di Fei, less than a foot from the penalty area line. Jewish's Tangnas took a free kick, but it was kicked out by Hu Han before it reached the goal. Tung Wah's five forwards advanced together, Nuonike inadvertently handled the ball, and Liu was penalized with a penalty kick. Cai Shengsen acted as the executioner, kicked the ball in (2-1), and Tung Wah took the lead again. There were only eight minutes left before the end of the match, but soon Cai, in the penalty area, was eager to save the ball and fell on Di Fei, and the referee also penalized a penalty kick. Mei You kicked it, but fortunately Zhang Banglun was quick-witted and rescued it from danger, avoiding disaster. Tung Wah then defeated Jewish Club 2-1 and won this year's championship. After the match, the vice president of the association, Kang Baosi, personally presented the awards, and everyone cheered and dispersed.</p>

<h3>Winter Vacation Homework</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Children! Time passes so quickly, and in the blink of an eye, the winter vacation has arrived again. Although the winter vacation is not as long as the summer vacation, we see the preciousness of time, so this short two-week winter vacation should seem to be fully utilized, and not be spent in confusion. Since we want to use the vacation, we should determine a plan for vacation homework at the beginning of this winter vacation. According to what I have seen, regarding vacation homework during the winter vacation, it can be done like this:</p>
<p>(1) Writing: Write a diary every day. We know that writing a diary has many benefits for writing skills. Those who usually have a diary at school should continue to write during the winter vacation. Those who don't have one can use the winter vacation to write a diary. As for composition, it should also be done. Ask a teacher or parent to give you a topic. Of course, it is also good if you can come up with your own topic; at least write one or two essays every week. If you can do this, even though the winter vacation is short, you can still make considerable progress in writing.</p>
<p>(2) Reading: Usually, we are busy with classes every day and schoolwork is very busy, so we often suffer from not having time to read more systematic long novels. But the winter vacation gives us an opportunity to choose several long reading materials according to your level, and spend one or two hours a day reading them during the winter vacation. That can also help you with your literary knowledge and progress.</p>
<p>(3) Tutoring: If you know that your grades are not very good in certain subjects, then you must not miss this winter vacation opportunity and should carefully review the textbooks from the past semester. For subjects like arithmetic, you should also do exercises. If you don't understand something, you can ask your parents or friends. This way, if you review for a winter vacation, you will be able to keep up with others when school starts. Otherwise, if you don't review during the winter vacation, not only will you not make any progress, but you will also forget things, and you will fall further behind next semester. Everyone should know about this!</p>
<h3>A Tribute to Scouting Founder Baden-Powell</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Scouting founder Baden-Powell, whose death was once mistakenly reported, has finally unfortunately passed away in Kenya! The bad news came from London, and everyone mourns and pays tribute to this elderly man. The International Scouting groups of all levels in this city have scheduled a memorial service for today (Sunday) at 3:00 PM at the Jiangxi Road Church, led by Scouting Commander Gordon. The brave Scouting teams, wearing black armbands today, must be filled with endless sadness.</p>
<p>Baden-Powell, an Englishman, founded the Boy Scouts in 1907, adopting the organizational methods of the military to train children in teamwork, endurance, public spirit, and good habits and skills. Later, other countries followed suit. Our country also established the China National Boy Scouts Association in the fourth year of the Republic of China [1915]. The organization is based on eight or twelve students aged twelve to twenty as a team, two or more teams as a troop, and above the troop is the county association and the provincial association. The teaching items are divided into first aid, fire fighting, sewing, cooking, and horseback riding, boating, camping, elementary surveying, map making, and radio broadcasting, etc. I remember that during the May Fourth Movement in 1919, when Peking University students overthrew Cao (Rulin), Zhang (Zongxiang), Lu (Zongyu), and others in the patriotic movement, all the Boy Scouts in Wuxi were dispatched to stand guard and maintain social order (at that time, the entire city was on strike). The heroic and high-spirited bravery left a deep impression. I cannot help but admire Baden-Powell all the more for his contribution to the world in founding Scouting. On this day of joint mourning, I pay my utmost respect to Baden-Powell.</p>
<h3>Small Problem</h3>
<p>— Cao Gu</p>
<p>Now there are several iron nails of different sizes. If you want to find its volume, how do you find it? The result must be accurate and easy to do.</p>
<p>If you use ordinary methods to find the volume, that would be extremely foolish. The calculation would be troublesome, and the result obtained would not be accurate. Because the ordinary method of finding volume is to multiply the base area by the height, although it is of course sufficient for general simple objects, but when you encounter objects like nails, with concave and convex parts, with flat, round, and triangular shapes, if you use the same method to find each nail one by one and then add them up one by one, wouldn't it be troublesome enough to cause a headache? Moreover, their values will not happen to be integers, but all endless decimals. How can the result obtained by multiplying endless decimals by endless decimals be accurate? So this method is not applicable. But, clever children! Can you think of a simple and accurate method? Now here is one, let's see below:</p>
<p>Take a cup, fill it with water to the brim, then put the nails to be measured into the cup, and the water in the cup will overflow. Collect the overflowed water and measure it with a measuring tube. The measured number is the volume of the nails, so many cubic inches or cubic feet. (If, in the above method, it is considered that the overflowed water is not easy to collect, you can use two cups of the same capacity, one with iron nails inside, and the other full of water (must be to the brim). Then pour the water into the cup with the nails, stop when it is full, and measure the water remaining in the cup. The result is the same.) What is the reason for this? The volume of these waters is equal to the volume of the nails. This is because after the nails enter the cup, they squeeze the same volume of water out of the cup. So the volume of the overflowed water is the volume of the nails. Suppose there is now a cup of blue water, exactly to the brim, but now you want to add a spoonful of red water, don't we have to take out a spoonful of blue water in advance, and then add the red water into the cup, so that the water in the cup does not overflow? Nails are the same. How much volume the nails have, after entering the water, they must discharge the same volume of water. Using this principle to find the volume of objects, isn't it simple and accurate?</p>
<h3>Elementary School Student Summer Homework Competition: Elementary Fifth Place: My Father</h3>
<p>— Cui Guang Elementary School Zuo Tianlin</p>
<p>My father is a professor at the university. He is proficient in French literature and is praised by many people; however, his temper is very stubborn, making it difficult for people to get close to him and making them afraid. At that time, I was still young, and my father did not often live with me; so I didn't understand anything. Later, my maternal grandmother told me about the situation at home, and I learned that my father was a professor at Henan University in Hefu; at that time, my mother and I lived together, and I felt happy with my mother's loving education. Who knew that an unfortunate event would happen soon? I don't know when, my father fell in love with a French woman and abandoned my loving mother, disregarding her life. My poor mother, at this time, all her expectations were completely lost, so she was overly saddened, accumulated love into illness, became seriously ill, and passed away, leaving me behind. From then on, I became a pitiful child without anyone's love, and I had to live with my maternal grandmother. With my maternal grandmother's support, I at least had clothes and food, and I didn't feel the pain of losing my mother.</p>
<p>During the July 7th Incident [1937], my father brought his stepmother and a pair of twins back to his hometown (Wuchang). He had no fatherly feelings for me at all. Not only did he have no feelings, but he even treated me like a little servant. Later, with the persuasion of relatives and friends, he asked me to go to school, but the tuition fee for each semester had to be obtained through bitter begging before he was willing to pay.</p>
<p>In the year of the August 13th Incident [1937], we took refuge in Shanghai, and he became a professor at a national university. His income was good, but the cost of living in Shanghai was increasing day by day. The whole family depended on my father's income, so my father was very depressed. I went to school in a nearby elementary school during the day, and when I came home from school in the morning, evening, and noon, I helped them with chores. Every day, their three meals were determined by them, and the amount could not be more than a grain of rice. As the cost of living increased, my father became even more annoyed. He would not let me continue my studies next semester and even wanted to send me to some kind of shelter. Alas! I am really a miserable child. I finally got the opportunity to study, and I have been studying for a year, and now continuing my studies is probably dangerous again.</p>
<p>I hope that some philanthropist can allow me to be a small servant morning and evening to help me go to school. I would be grateful beyond words. I am very strange, I love my father, but my father abandons me!</p>
<h3>Vigor</h3>
<p>— Shen Xishen</p>
<p>Generally speaking, a very young person should have a kind of "vigor." Children, do you know the meaning of the two words "vigor"? It means that in the morning, a round of rising sun has just risen from the east. At this time, the air is so fresh; "the whole day's plan lies in the morning." The so-called birdsong and fragrant flowers, and gentle breeze, all things at this time have a thriving image, which is the bursting of vigor; now, in a broad sense, a young person is just like the clear morning of a day. They should have a strong physique, a happy spirit, and an optimistic ambition, so on his appearance, there is also a thriving vigor that can be seen. With this kind of vigor, whether you go to school or do things, are you still afraid of not succeeding? And the future hope is also unlimited!</p>
<p>Children, do you also have this kind of vigor? This is indispensable for every modern youth. If you feel that you still lack this kind of vigor, it is not a very difficult thing to obtain it. You only need to go to bed early and get up early, work, play, and even eat at a certain time, do not read useless books and newspapers, do not do meaningless things, and always keep a happy concept in your heart. If you persist in this way, I believe you will surely become a vigorous and energetic person.</p>
<h3>How to Deal With Our Enemies</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhaobing</p>
<p>Have we often heard news of many children being lured and kidnapped recently? Even on Tongfu Road, three children were murdered by bandits. This is such a cruel and terrible thing! Indeed, on this evil island, we really have to pay attention at all times; otherwise, there is a danger of accidents happening at any time.</p>
<p>However, we deduce the reasons for being lured and kidnapped, which is nothing more than that the children's families have huge assets and love to eat and play. As long as there is something to eat and play, they rashly go with him without asking the reason, so the bandits have seized this weakness as an offensive weapon. The tragic death of the three children on Tongfu Road before is a very obvious example.</p>
<p>So how can we make it impossible for bandits to start? What is written below is just a few things that I thought of at random.</p>
<p>1. That is, don't love to eat and play too much.</p>
<p>2. You should go home immediately after school, and do not linger on the road.</p>
<p>3. Carefully identify whether the person who is talking to you is good or bad.</p>
<p>4. If you have discovered that the other party is a traitor, then you should use a calm, alert, and fearless attitude, and think of ways to prevent him from escaping: such as reporting to the nearby police officer and adults walking on the road.</p>
<p>5. Students should help each other, such as escorting younger students, and must monitor the actions of the person who is talking to a student.</p>
<p>If the children can do as I have written above, then I think that at least many unfortunate events other than violence can be prevented.</p>

<h3>"Green Jewel"’s "Home"</h3>
<p>— Tian Yi</p>
<p>Regarding the adaptation of Ba Jin's "Home" for the stage, a dispute has arisen between "Green Jewel" and "Drama Arts Society." What is written here concerns the "moving" of "Home." The "Home" at the Green Jewel Theater is adapted by Jia Qi.</p>
<p>This "Home" is arranged into five acts. The location of the first act is the "living room" of the "Gao Family," the location of the second act is the "study" of the "Gao Family," the location of the third act is the "bedroom" of the brothers "Jue Min" and "Jue Hui," the location of the fourth act is again the "living room" of the "Gao Family," and the location of the fifth act is "Jue Xin's" "room." There is no need to discuss the atmosphere on stage. The props are quite lazy. The "living room" and "study" are naturally the best, but Jue Min and Jue Xin's "bedroom" is open to question. At that time in "Chengdu," in such a "large family," would the furniture be like that? Especially Jue Xin's room; we know that Jue Xin's room should be a room for a married man, a "room" with many furnishings. Even for the sake of convenience, the bed must be a "large bed," and definitely not replaced by a "small steel bed."</p>
<p>Regarding the performance, the assignment of actors also lacks consideration. Jue Min is only a nineteen-year-old youth, but how can Tian Xiaoqing's "old and seasoned" appearance on stage cope? Because Jue Min becomes "older," the director makes Jue Xin "old" as a result. Hu Shiqi performed quite well, but the makeup inevitably wronged him. Liu Yixin's "Grandfather" and Tian Xin's "Aunt Chen" were considered good. Ye Tianqiu's "Taoist Priest" had no acting worth mentioning. Zhuang Hongjun's "Servant" was quite good. Zhu Yizhen's "Zhou Shi" was too stiff, lacking expression, and the clothing was also "too ordinary." Hu Liaoran's "Fifth Uncle" did not perform poorly, but there were too many "low-level taste" affectations, inevitably becoming "clownish." If he could correct the "Yangzhou playboy" style of civilized drama, there is hope for the future. Wang Xueyan, who played "Zhang Qin," does not fit the personality. Zhang Qin, this kind of "female student," is not something Wang Xueyan can portray. There is a kind of "subconscious coquetry," which is the most unacceptable "civilized drama characteristic," and the unnatural pronunciation, forced into a shrill, strange tone, is even more unacceptable. As for Fan Suqin's "Wan'er," she was very good. The most successful was Cai Juanjuan, who played "Ming Feng," followed by Gu Menghu, who played "Gao Jue Hui." Cai Juanjuan's pronunciation was so clear, and her expression was so delicate. She is indeed a female actress worthy of praise. Gu Menghu's weakness is also that he is not "young" enough in age, but overall, he grasped the character of "Jue Hui."</p>
<p>Third, I want to talk about the playwright and the director. Jia Qi was too focused on "saving effort." Too many "characters" from the original work were deleted. "Mei," "Duan Jue," "Uncle," "Fourth Uncle," "Third Aunt," "Fourth Aunt," "Aunt," "Shu Ying," "Shu Hua," etc., who were related to the entire story, did not appear on stage. And the arrangement of the plot was also extremely lazy. Mei's "death," Duan Jue's "death," Grandfather's "death," etc., were only narrated verbally. In particular, Grandfather's death is the beginning of the collapse of the "Home." He could realize his mistakes, he could recognize the emptiness of the "aristocratic family," so his earnest conversation with Jue Min and Jue Hui before his death was extremely meaningful. Regarding this, in Ba Jin's writing, it is a very moving section. On stage, the conversation was moved forward to the "living room," lightly passing over a "climax." The playwright's error and the director's incompetence—a three-hour play without any "climax"—is too ridiculous.</p>
<p>In short, I do not despise Green Jewel, but I have to point out: it was a failure. This decision to stage "Home" is certainly a good trend, but the choice of script must be especially cautious, the talent of the director must be paid more attention to, and the most basic thing is the cultivation of the actors.</p>
<h3>Willow in the Brothel</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Liu Rushi, in Yushan, successively heard the bad news of Yu Qi's righteous army's ship capsizing, the army's defeat and escape, his arrest and murder, and wrung her wrists and sighed. On the day Yu Qi was murdered, Liu Rushi cried for him all night, her tears soaking her pillow. Qian Muzhai, however, privately rejoiced that he had not drafted the declaration for Yu Qi, or he would have suffered the disaster of family extermination. However, the matter of Liu Rushi rewarding the troops was inevitably slightly leaked to the outside world, and the Nanjing side wanted to investigate this matter and punish Qian for the crime of rebellion. Qian Muzhai was extremely anxious and had no choice but to produce his family property. When it was not enough, he borrowed from relatives and went to Nanjing to use his influence and buy favors, and only then was he able to conceal this matter and gradually quell it. Although Muzhai did not dare to blame Rushi, Rushi felt even more disheartened because of this matter and stayed hidden. Jiangyun Tower also suffered a fire, and the situation deteriorated day by day. In the meantime, Muzhai once went to Yanjing to serve as an official of the Qing Dynasty, but this was not Liu Rushi's wish. She used words to remonstrate several times, but could not change Muzhai's mind. Moreover, Muzhai had already been noticed by the Qing Dynasty, and at this time, he had no choice but to be a slave to others and could not make his own decisions. Therefore, when Muzhai went north, Liu Rushi remained in Yushan, closing her doors and refusing to go to that bloody and greasy Yanjing, so as not to wound her delicate heart. Muzhai could do nothing about it. He arrived in Beijing and had nothing to do. The flow of flatterers and those seeking glory rushed ahead of him, and he could not get his turn, but instead suffered a lot of sarcastic ridicule, which was unbearable. In the end, he returned to Yushan, gaining nothing and losing much. Fame and fortune were like flowers in a mirror and the moon in the water, and he was ridiculed by others. It was truly a moment's mistake that brought eternal regret. What good was it to protect oneself wisely? Moreover, he owed a lot of debt to others, so he was often unhappy. Liu Rushi practiced frugality, wearing simple clothes and washing away the past splendor, and people praised her virtue. Muzhai was depressed and frustrated, but Rushi consoled him with the gentleman's joy in the Tao and contentment in poverty. At this time, Muzhai regretted even more that he had not died for his country before.</p>

<p>— Xing Gu</p>
<p>Newcomer Lü Qi Plays a Key Role in the New Film</p>
<p>Amidst the excitement of actors and dancers successively appearing on the screen, now, another loyal student of cinematic art, under the discovery of Ma-Xu Weibang, is about to step onto the screen. She is Miss Lü Qi.</p>
<p>Originally, after completing the United Nations' "Song at Midnight Sequel," Ma-Xu prepared to self-fund the production of a film. Because a large number of people were needed, he is now discovering new talents in various places, discovering new talents with genuine artistic talent.</p>
<p>Miss Lü Qi is a modern girl who is infatuated with art. She previously studied at Huaijiu Girls' Middle School and then attended the New Spring and Autumn Drama School. Through the introduction of someone, she met Ma-Xu. When talking about movies, she expressed her willingness to contribute her life to the screen. Thus, with both parties satisfied, Ma-Xu decided to assign her an important role when he self-funds the film.</p>
