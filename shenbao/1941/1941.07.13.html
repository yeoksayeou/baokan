<h3>英美蘇將合作　防日南進</h3>
<p>國際社十二日華盛頓電　此間外交界方面預測、若日本南進、英美蘇或將密切合作、衆信、星期四羅斯福總航與蘇大使烏曼期基會談甚久、諒巳談及遠東方面種種可能變化、允談及日本有何新行動時蘇聯之任務、惟據報吿、此次會議本意、在於加速援蘇、國務院對外發表、並無激怒日本之處、但援蘇計劃、衆信、正在有效加速中、就軍用品而論、公認美國若以之接濟蘇聯、決不以不損其國防程序與援英計劃、</p>
<h3>德蘇戰爭進人第二階段　蘇聯最高指揮部改組　紅軍三大砥柱公任前敵總司令　戰士八百萬調前線準備殊死戰</h3>
<p>塔斯社十二日莫斯科電蘇聯國防委員會鑒於前方現已分爲三綫、特訓令最高指揮成立三指揮總部、以期加速擊潰敵人、（一）伏羅希洛夫大元帥被委爲西北指揮部總指揮、（二）國防委長丁莫生柯大元帥被委爲西指揮部總指揮、（三）布特尼大元帥被委爲西南指揮部總指揮、</p>
<p>路透社十二日倫敦電莫斯科無綫電臺昨夜聲稱、伏羅希洛夫。丁莫生柯與布特尼三上將、巳分別被任爲前綫西北區西區與西南區總司令、業巳就職、查此三員上將乃蘇聯防務組織中之三大砥柱、伏羅希洛夫於一九四〇年八月七日被任爲國防委員長、本年七月一日任國防議會議員、丁莫生柯本年月八日繼伏氏出任國防委員長、布特尼上將乃紅軍騎兵總監、曾在內戰中建巨功、去年八月十六日被任爲國防委會副委員長、</p>
<p>路透社十二日倫敦電　聞蘇德兩軍司令現皆乘新的暴風雨前之沉寂、調出生力軍駐往前錢、土京無綫電豪廣播莫斯科最近消息云、蘇聯近動員之軍隊不下八百萬人、刻正開往戰綫云、倫敦方面認德軍新攻勢行將展開、而目下之停頓或係德方坦克車員疲憊所致、</p>
<p>路透社十二日倫敦電　過去三十六小時內、東綫無重大變化、三處指揮部所統率之蘇聯軍隊、現正準備第二階段之戰事、聞蘇聯情報局長前索夫斯基會語各報訪員、謂局勢將可於三週內擅於明朗、據莫斯科無綫電宣稱、紅軍斥堠隊入敵軍後方、並於攻入德司令部時、獲得有價値之文件、</p>
<p>路透社十二日倫敦電「每日電聞報」評述蘇德戰事之停頓現狀云、現有充分理由可信此偉大戰事之下一階段必將較第一階段更爲猛烈、侵略者雖有退縮之意、但亦不能目不敢出此、彼等現在所冒危險之結果、非獲勝利即遭慘敗、此項大規模戰事、決小能以恢複原狀而終結、德國如失敗則納粹統制全世界之迷夢即吿崩潰、此項戰事之勞力傷財殊難估計、此所以英國自覺在道道德上、應乘德蘇戰事术分勝負之際、加倍努力轟炸德方海港工業中心、及交通路綫云、</p>
<p>路透社十二日倫敦電　蘇聯情報局最近發表之公報內稱、七月十一日晚間各方前綫之吾軍陣地，均無變動、吾方空軍繼續痛擊敵軍坦克車隊及其摩托化與機械化部隊、敵軍機塲及羅馬尼亞境內普洛斯蒂地方之油田亦均遭吾機轟炸、七月十一日吾空軍共擊落敵機六十五柴、吾機失縱者十九架、又據蘇聯情報局副局長盧素夫斯基向各報記者談稱、德軍曾在若干地方施放毒質、吾人對此尙未報復、吾人已於六月二十五日之公報中作此營吿矣、</p>
<p>合衆十二日莫期科電昨夜公報甚爲簡潔、與前夜相同、表示蘇德戰綫上之龐大猛暫告停頓、蘇軍前此因猝不及防、致遭德軍攻入、現似已重整旗鼓集合力、沿舊有之最堅強防綫、與德意志陸軍對峙、依據蘇方據言觀之、此陣綫實尙未被擊破也、</p>
<p>合衆社十二日柏林電　「摩根報」昨稱、蘇聯現已在斯達林防綫後、從事組織　堅强之新防禦此語似乎德國尙未衝破蘇聯最後之鞏固防綫、該報又稱、莫斯科軍隊數量上固甚充分、而可暫時阻住德軍之進展、然德軍在比挨里斯托克及明斯克之勝利、已可充分證明蘇軍所有之抵抗必失敗云、</p>
<h3>巨人鐵拳打破迷夢　德軍攻勢業被遏阻</h3>
<p>塔斯社十二日莫斯科電「紅星報」評稱、「蘇聯巨人之鐵拳、已擊醒希特勒將士「無敵」及「閃電」之迷夢矣、全世界目前必可自德國探悉紅軍士兵決不畏　所謂「突入」「鉗形」戰術、彼等決不動搖或沮喪、吾人知敵甚深、敵人之鬼計吾人亦深知之、敵人仍圖孤注一擲、但其「無敵」之稱已碎、敵已嘗試紅軍之偉大力量」</p>
<p>合衆社十二日柏林電德官方通訊社咋稱、在蘇德前綫推進之德軍攻勢、已因道路之閉塞而退阻、此綫德軍作戰數日、企圖在明斯克及比挨里斯托克區域內將被圍之蘇完全肅清、然因道路全被堆積之蘇聯坦克車及其他戰車遺骸所擠塞、暫時不能前進、又言德軍如欲繼續推進、必須先將山積之戰具移在一旁、</p>
<h3>蘇聯組織特種軍隊　決全力保衛列寗城</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯社十二日芬京電　據「眞理報」載稱、蘇聯刻正組織特種軍隊、名爲「殲滅及防守部隊」用以保衛列寗格勒城、其中大部爲一九一七－一九年革命軍人、該報同時籲請政府、肅淸資產階級餘孽云、</p>
<p>路透社十二日倫敦電　莫斯科無綫電稱、「眞理報」昨日社評、重述斯達林所稱德軍最精師團已被爛潰之言、但警告蘇聯人民謂、「當前將有惡戰、吾人將絕不困擾敵軍而擊敗之、」</p>
<h3>初期戰爭龐大犧牲　侵蘇德軍死傷百萬</h3>
<p>合衆社十二日倫敦電昨日此間名方面之印象、認爲納粹軍隊過去數日之行動、目的在於覓取紅軍防綫之「弱點」、如法國之色當然、蘇聯之防守、無疑的已予納粹之初期戰事以龐大之犧牲、　據所得消息、德國物力人力並無遺乏之跡象、軍事觀察察專家稱、倘能探得「弱點」而作適當之運籌、則由芬蘭以迄黑海之全部防綫威脅、衆信新攻勢將發生於戰綫之中區、該處除波羅的海各小國外、德軍最爲、次入中區綫之要點、爲波勃魯斯克、里貝爾戰區及波勃魯斯克、蘇軍調產守波勃魯克及里貝爾、且猛烈反攻得手、至於波勃魯斯克之情形混沌、此聞軍事專家謂過去數日、德軍略有進展云、</p>
<p>合衆社十二日莫斯利電蘇聯外交副委員長羅索夫斯基宣佈、德軍侵蘇以來、死傷已逾一百寓人、（按德政府通訊社亦稱、蘇聯士兵之死傷及被俘的達一百萬人云）</p>
<h3>明斯克區大包圍戰　德誇稱獲空前勝利</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯社十一日柏林電此間廣播電台頃發出消息稱、「蘇聯潰敗僅爲時間問題、德軍在比挨里斯托克與明斯克一帶所獲勝利、殆爲空前未有、戰略乃偉大藝術祁、其目標不在佔領重要據點、而爲包圍敵軍加以殲滅、古代漢屁拔將軍加納之役、近世興登堡將軍丹能堡之役、此决歐戰中德軍在波蘭維斯都、河流域、比國佛朗德區、暨最近比挨里斯托克諸役、均其明證、蘇聯軍隊被俘獲者四十萬員名、損失總數在五十萬員名以上、蘇聯飛機亦損失七十三隊」云、</p>
<h3>人力資源得天獨厚　蘇聯奠定勝利基礎</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯社十二日重慶電中央日報今日以「蘇聯已奠定勝利基礎」爲題、評論德蘇戰事、其文有云、「我們相信經過三個星期的奮鬭、蘇聯的最後勝利、已經有了保障、這完全是戰果、不是偏於情感的說法」、又云、「在太平洋方面鞏固濱海省的防務、使日本無機可乘、保障美國的接濟時竭力消耗德軍誘其深入、然後運用地形人力物力、一舉而擊潰之、這是蘇聯制勝的唯一戰略、日來蘇軍各綫奏捷、德國內在弱點益形暴露、而蘇軍戰的成功、更由此得一有力設明、德軍難免不作困獸之鬥、但是蘇聯的最後勝利、已經奠立其不拔之基」云、（上）布特尼（下右）丁莫生柯　（下左）伏羅希洛夫</p>
<h3>羅斯福總統　電加里寗　對蘇表示同情　並祝奮鬥成功</h3>
<p>塔斯社十二日莫斯科電蘇聯最高議會主席團主席加甩寗與美總統羅斯福近日有電文往還、加里寗致羅斯福電文稱、「際茲貴國慶祝獨立紀念時節、本人謹請閣下接受蘇聯人民之熱誠賀意、蘇聯人民正以武器爲自由向前進人類公敵德法西斯統治者作戰、謹祝關下及偉大美國民途光明」羅斯福覆電云、「辱承電賀鄙國獨立節、甚感、俄國人民英勇向殘忍侵境者作戰、深爲感佩、美國人民痛惡武力侵略、美蘇人民友誼素篤、俄國人民現爲自衛英勇奮鬥、自必獲得吾人之同情及敬慕、本人茲謹代表美國人民、恭祝貴國人民奮鬥成功、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>德國的隱憂</h3>
<p>檢討一週來德蘇戰况、納粹軍的主要攻勢，依然停留在北起奧斯特洛夫，中經里貝爾，波里索夫，波勃魯斯克諸城，南達諾夫格拉伏林斯克的一綫，這和上週的形勢，幾乎沒有絲毫變化，消息傳來，連日前綫戰事反而已趨沉寂，此一事實，證明德軍的第一期攻勢顯已遇到了頓挫，今後一方需要鞏固已得的陣地，維持常被紅軍破壞的后方交通，一方更需要補充或抽換業已疲憊的前方兵力，以便進行次期攻勢。可是在德方攻勢暫吿停頓的一剎那間，蘇聯却已運用其嚴密的機構，發揮其超特的組織力，在國內動員了數百萬大軍，同時更把冗長的全綫，劃分為三大戰區，由紅軍的「三大砥柱」伏洛希羅夫，丁莫生柯與蒲第亞尼三人分任指揮，麵斯達林所宣佈的焦土政策和游擊戰術，也已在前方發生了重大的作用，因此，不但紅軍已在各路前綫，取得穩定地位，甚至已可不時發動有力反攻，使希特勒不得不暫時把他的閃電戰，弛緩下來，以便重新研究今後的作戰計劃，這在反侵略陣綫方面而言，可謂已在時間上佔了若干便宜。</p>
<p>為希特勒設想，他旣發過八星期內結束對蘇戰事的豪語，今後自須加緊作戰，以免自損威望，何况德蘇戰事若竟不能速戰速決，則一俟英美準備就緖，正式發動西綫攻勢、軸心國便有真正遭遇兩面作戰的危機，那時不僅損失威望而已，恐怕兩年來所辛苦取得的軍事優勢，行將整個毀滅；祗許勝，不許敗，而且必須「速勝」，不容拖長，萬一在軍事上陸續有些進展，而實際上却演成像中日戰事一樣的長期消耗戰，那在兩面受敵的德國，仍是一個不了之局；因此可以想見希特勒日來趁着前綫的暫時沉寂，正在積極籌劃他的次期行動，而且不妨推想他的內心是如何慌張，如何憂急。</p>
<p>第一，他當然竭力想慫勇日本在遠東助他一臂之力，但是問題的癥結，正在德軍能否長驅直入，速操勝劵，假定德蘇戰事陷於相持狀態，則乖巧而疲憊的日本決無再替軸心向火中取栗的右能，尤其是日本過去上軸心的當，已不止一次，今後如果沒有確切把握，焉肯抑且焉敢再事妄動？充其量頂多繼續渾水摸魚政策，再向孤立無援的越南，作進一步的壓榨，若說正式南進或北進，則至少須在德軍攻入莫斯科之後。</p>
<p>第二，希特勒在上月二十二日發動對蘇攻勢的時候，用的是全綫進攻的凶猛戰略，當時的確其勢汹汹，好像挾有萬鈞之力，苟非紅軍素質佳良，此際的蘇聯恐已早步波蘭或法蘭西的後塵；但經過三財的衝擊，希特勒當已明瞭這種「全面進攻」的戰略，斷難制勝一個有組織，有實力，而且後備充裕的强敵，今後為補救計，或須改變方針，集中兵力向若干主要目標猛撲，質言之，與其沿着一千五百英里的冗長戰綫作戰，以致兵力分散，後方空虛，似不如頃全力嚮一二重要據點猛襲，或者較易奏功；所惜時間是不饒人的，希特勒倘在上月二十二日，集中一百數十師的兵力，向明斯克一綫進撲，紅軍猝不及防，必難堅守，德方的「奔閃」部隊此際早已迫近莫斯科，但此種戰略苟欲用之於今日，則不獨事實上調集如許兵力，已有困難，抑且在蘇聯動員早已完成，以及紅軍的人力物力接濟無窮的條件下，恐怕不等納粹軍事當局改弦易轍，蘇方早已先發制人，乘虛攻入防務單薄的敵境。</p>
<p>第三，希特勒鍳於蘇聯境內的戰事，將有變成長期消耗戰的危險，或者妄想出奇制勝，圖向其他方面，「另闢蹊徑」？觀于外傳德大軍集中保加利亞邊境，企圖進窺土耳其海峽之說，可知希特勒在進退失據之中，確有拿小國當爼肉，以挽回其威望的可能；但是，關於此層，看來雖似輕而易舉，其實也是困難多端，蓋一則土耳其未必就範，萬一翻臉，它的作戰力量至少可與希臘媲美，二則叙利亞戰事已成尾聲，英國中東軍經過一個多月的休養補充，正可重新踏上歐洲戰塲，幫助蘇土抗戰，三則英蘇合作之局，已日趨强化，日前甚至盛傳英蘇兩國要求伊朗允許假道運兵，可見萬一德軍再在東地中海方面發動新攻勢，前途祗會遇到更多的荊棘，更多的危險。</p>
<p>就上所述，希特勒因對蘇作戰不能速決而起的苦悶　已不難想見一斑，若再加上近日美國態度的益趨積極，如　美海軍之接防冰島，　美國工人之在英國五十餘根據地參加軍事工程，　美艦之在大西洋上，一度向德潛艇發彈警吿，這一切一切，當然更使希特勒覺察西綫方面即將發生可怕的「事變」，假定在不久的將來，他真的需要在東西兩面，應付英美蘇三國的聯合陣綫，則縱非整個軸心組織立即崩潰，至少也是納粹覇權的末日臨頭。</p>

<h3>世界大戰結束後　中國成一等強國　拉鐵摩譽中國爲列強之一　英勇作戰已備具必要條件　大陸報評術戰後列強應重行估價</h3>
<p>蔣委員長之政治顧問拉鐵摩、於赴渝就任途中、過檀島時、曾發表談話、譽中國已躋於世界列強之林、足證中國國除地位、業已增高、以在世界正義人士心目中、中國能英勇作戰、堅決反抗侵略、其所掘任之工作、固與英美蘇相同也、本埠英文大陸報對拉氏談話、昨日會著文加以評論、認係卓見、茲迻譯該文於後、</p>
<p>列強地位重行估價　刻在赴渝途次這新任蔣委員長政治顧問拉鐵摩、星期日曾在檀香山宜稱、「中國反抗日本侵略、作戰四載之絕犬結果、厥爲中國巳成世界一大强國、」查過去四年來、震驚世界之大事迭起、對於各强國之地位、確須重行估定、一</p>
<p>如何始可構成強國　中日戰爭爆發前、一般俱認美，英。法·德·義·日·蘇爲世界列强估定構成强國之因素、有若干種、如人力·武備·工業組織·天然富湖·國民資財及使國家強盛之其他任何因素皆是、但就第二次世界大戰之結果觀之、世人估計各國強盛之因素、不盡恰當、</p>
<p>目前當推美英蘇德　以目前而論、有四個里要强國、因左右世事、皆應歸人強國之列、即美·英·德·蘇·是、此四國力量雖非絕對相等、然究屬舉世各國間之龐然大國、若謂此四國掌中、握有決定目前國際問題之巨大勢力、固合理之結論也、</p>
<p>法義日之現在地位　法·義·日·三國，在信此世界大戰中所表現者、自然巳引起根本應吾視其爲列强之問題、在現况下、充其量祇能將法·義·日列入二等強國、當然不可與前述四強國同日而語、</p>
<p>大戰結束一切改觀　以言中國從事武裝衝突、其成績遠大法·義可及、而已使日本陷於僵局不得脫身、故謂中國亦有列入二等強國之資格、富極公允之論也、今此戰爭終告結束時、列強之等級、將有重新評定之必要、無疑的、美·英·蘇·佔有優勢、可擊敗德國、至少將其暫時除出一等強國之列、而其他任何軸心國能否保持「強國」之稱遂成問題矣、</p>
<p>中國將成一等強國　中國則有升至國地位，與美英蘇有並駕齊驅之機會、中國之擊敗日本、內部團結、利用龐大大然富源、與夫發展工業、必將使其升至在世事中大佔勢力之地位、事有不應忘懷者、中國對其他一等强國、即美英·蘇·之友誼關係、匪特不致妨磚中國地位之提高、抑且足以促進之、拉鐵摩指中國爲世界·大强國、固眞實之言也、</p>
<h3>英商電車及公共車　明日同時漲價　市民將安步當車以節糜費　法商公共車行車時限太苛</h3>
<p>公共租界英商公共汽車公司、及英商電車公司、以營業收支不能相抵爲理由、呈准工部局、定明日起同時漲價、上海市民團體前會籲請免予實行、卒未見效、</p>
<p>英商電車漲價通告　公共租界英商上海電車公司、上次漲價迄今、爲時無幾、最近增加職工生活津貼、支出增加、股東利益較减、曾擬漲價、因迫於輿論、宣吿展期、茲鑒於公共汽車宣吿十四日起漲價、故亦急起直追、請工部局予以核准、俾得同時實行、工部局亦予以許可、故該公司昨發通吿云、「修正之車資、將於一九四一年七月十四日起實行、所有新價目、將揭貼於本公司各車輛內、此吿、總經理伊文」、</p>
<p>公司所持論加價理由　上海電車公司提高電車票價、計頭等平均每英里自六分三釐七增至九分一釐一、三等平均每英里自四分八釐七增至七分二釐九、其所持之理由爲滙價續降、以及國外戰局影響、以致各項營業用費激增、使公司投資應得之純益减少、故呈請准予提高票價、經工部局六月十一日會議核准、中國公共汽車公司再增票價理由、爲自上年十二月間修改車票後、各項物價無不劇漲、加以發給職工津貼、以致開支激增、應付爲難、故請求准予提高車資、經工部局公用事業委員會詳細研究、通過准在每英里最高一角五分之範圍內、平均提增票價百分之六五：五四、准七月十四日起實行、</p>
<p>安步當車　實爲上策　英商中國公共汽車公司加價、（平均漲起百分之六十）、實爲該公司歴次漲價之最大額、各界市民、前會組織團體、反對公用車輛增價、加車市民負担、今旣斷然實行、故特再籲謂各界、以刻苦耐勞精神、實行「安步當車」、使公司漲價結果、得不償失、俾達制裁目的、則生活威脅亦可稍形减少、而刻苦耐勞精神、更可促成健康體魄與習慣、一改頹唐生活、</p>
<p>一分鐘一站制之弊　法商公共汽車、因公司當局施行之一分鐘一站制度、致使司機售票逢站不開車門、或未經乘客全部上下車前、即行開車、致使傾跌受傷事件不斷發生、市民特籲請公司當局以乘客生命爲重、取銷現行制度、俾行駛車輛不受時開限制、司機售票不再玩忽職務、庶乘客生命不致視同兒戲、</p>
<p>法商車輛亦擬漲價　英租界電車公共汽車公吿十四日起漲價後、法商公共汽車及電車、亦巳請求法租界公董局、審核漲價、惟該局對於要求、尙未集議、將俟董事會開會時提出討論、</p>
<p>廣東輪所裝機件　昨未卸岸</p>
<p>英商太古公司之廣東輪、於前日（十日）中午由法租界外灘本行碼頭啓捉、於駛經吳淞口時、遭日軍扣留、雖經公司當局迭决交涉、但亦未獲效果、據日海軍稱、須將該輪所承載安洋利行託運之機件卸岸後、始放准行、該輪以此項貨物、業已</p>
<p>經過報關　手續、故未予允諾、迄至昨晚、猶未能駛離本埠、叉據記者向安利洋行探悉、輪上所載該洋行之機件、並未卸岸、現全部案件、已由輪船公司當局移交與英駐滬總領事署、將由英總領事喬治循</p>
<p>外交途徑　予以解決據西報載、此項機器、乃安利洋行所有之紡織機、擬運往荷屬東印度、惟日軍當局堅稱機器係運往中國後方者、可加沒收云、叉謂、機器裝輪前未受檢查、故日方扣留廣東號輪、現日當局因天雨、尙未檢查此項機器、</p>

<h3>本埠波蘭使署　昨追悼故總統　凄風苦雨追思故人偉蹟素車白馬各界紛往執紼</h3>
<p>前波蘭共和國大總統及世界名鋼琴家巴達萊斯基民、於上月三十日逝世於紐的後、全世波蘭人民及各友邦人士、或以崇敬其開國之偉業、或因欽慕其音樂之造詣、無論識與不識、均同聲震悼，本埠波蘭使署、因此於咋晨九時假大主堂街卅六號聖的瑟敎堂舉行追思彌撒、雖昨晨凄風苦雨、參加者極踴躍、</p>
<p>肅然起敬　教堂佈置壯穆巴氏遺像正懸其中、奕奕如生、令人肅然起敬、俄而哀樂低奏、儀式開始、祈禱唱詩、聊抒悲懷、繼以講道、在座者屏息以聽、空氣緊張、歷一小時餘、始於悠揚音樂聲中散會、計昨日參加追悼者、中西人士凡數百餘人、本埠外交界耍人、亦均被邀參加、</p>
<p>參加人物</p>

<h3>上海托兒所素描  蕙</h3>
<p>在工廠材立的滬西區，有一個開辦方才四月，但巳取得社會人仕信仰，專門福工人子女的機關，那就是女靑年會主辦的上海托兒所。上海托兒所開設在白利南路空氣淸鮮的同仁醫院內。現收容着一至四歲的兒童三十名。</p>
<p>上海托兒所的性質，完全是耍服務一般家境貧苦的工人階級。在物價高漲，居住擁擠的情形之下，受生活的壓迫最重，需要幫助最切迫的還是工人。這可以從下列的兩事實得着强有力的證明：第一，要求入所的兒童，經醫師檢查體格，因患有肺病或傳染性的皮膚病而被淘汰的居大多數。第二，體格檢查及格的兒童，也絕對難找到健康活潑的孩子。他們多數是瘦小軟弱，抵抗力薄弱，站在疾病的邊綠上，經不起任何種疾病的侵襲的。因此，在今春痧子和百日咳盛行的時候，為要避免所內孩子普遍的傳染這些疾病，便不得不很早的替他們打針預防。這普遍的非病而又非健康的現象，主耍的是因為勞工界的收入談不到給兒童以適當的營養；同時，在外工作的母親，文不能給兒童以合理的看護；，因此，上海托兒所便在應付勞工界迫切的需求之下而產生了。</p>
<p>在所的兒童三一十人，每人每月的膳食費（三餐及點心）平均的在三十元左右。他們的衣服鞋襪以及其他一切的用具，都是由所中供給的。因此，該托兒所每月的支出連房租以及職員薪金等在內，總在二千元左右。直到現在為止，這筆用費全是捐募來的。但是為要使父母感覺對於自已的子女，也負有責任起見，他們也斟酌父母的經濟狀况，鼓勵他們各根據自己經濟能力，每月認繳數元寄養費。但這完全是出於自願的，因為每月總有人來要求說，家裏有人生病，拿不出錢，也有人要求說，上月祖母去世欠了債，寄養費以後幾月不能繳來。在這樣的情形之下，主辦人方面當然不願意免强他們。現在有一部分的兒童，是由熟心社會服務事業的人認養的，認養兒童的辦法是每月認捐二十元，認養某一兒童在三年以上的，女靑年會方面便將認養人的姓名做了一塊瓷牌，掛在被認養的兒童的床上，以作紀念。在這些照片中，有一張是五個活潑可愛的孩子同攝的。這五個孩子就是一位熱心社會事業的太太所認養的。筆者前次看見他們的時候，他們都是面黃肌瘦，見人畏縮，但隔開了兩個多月的今天，再去看他們的時候，他們巳變成了活潑可愛，對人笑嘻嘻的孩子了。</p>
<p>所中一切的設備及用具，都是在養成健康兒童所必備的條件之下審愼地選擇和備辦的。兒童的食物，也是力求其合於營養。主辦人的意思是竭力將道一托兒所辦理得科學化，但同時也要平民化。因為道些孩子在四歲以後是要離開托兒所而回到自己的家裏去的。兒童的生活習慣假如養得與一般的社會生活情形，過於隔離，那末，這些孩子在日後的生活適應方面，必然會發生許多困難的。現在每二星期父母可往托兒所探望二次，以免父母與子女中間發生時間和空間所造成的隔膜。</p>
<p>總之，上海托兒所在主任一人，看護一人，保姆四人，以及其他職員協力辦理之下，已經有很顯著的成績了。像這一類新興的社會事業，是需耍社會人士在精神和物資方面合力的援助和鼓勵的。我個人感覺我們應該實行有力出力，有錢出錢的去幫助它生長起來，並竭力把這個托兒所運動推廣開來，為下一代的國民造福。（尙有銅圖明日登載）</p>

<h3>錢業票據交換方法之我見</h3>
<p>— 傑克</p>
<p>錢　業各會員莊間之票據收解，向來採用軋公單之方法，若與銀行業票據交換所採用之方法相比較，固甚簡陋也。錢業中明達之士，頗不乏主張加以改革者。今年錢業準備庫爲易於查正數字錯誤，及結算當日各戶餘額計，乃採用「票據交換公單報吿表」，而於六月二日起實行。</p>
<p>「票據交換公單報吿表」直長十五英寸半，橫闊八英寸半一。表名分三行橫排，第一行爲「上海錢業聯合準備庫」，第二行爲「會員莊」，第三行爲「票據交換公單報吿表」，其下則列年月日。表中則列各會員莊之名稱，其排列之决序爲大德·大賚·元盛·五豐·仁昶·安康·安裕·存德·同潤·同餘·均昌·均泰·惠昌·承裕·怡大·和豐·信孚·信裕·春元·益大·致祥·振泰·順康·義昌·福康·福源·賡裕·聚康·滋豐·慶大·慶成·鼎康·徵祥·衡九·衡通·鴻勝·寳豐·金源·福利·愼德·怡和·信中·信和·永隆·其昌·寳昌·泰來·敦裕·滋康·建昌·錢業準備庫。莊名之右爲「收入國幣」欄，其左爲「付出國幣」欄。表之右邊列「注意」三項：「（一）茲爲便利查核起見，此後各寳莊祇須將當日交換收付公單數目塡入本表，送交準備庫外，其當日收下之公單可留存本莊以備查對；（二）本表內數目務希塡寫淸楚；（三）本表收付方法以各塡表莊爲主體」。表之左邊爲「右表送交上海錢業聯合準備庫台照」，其下爲會員莊蓋章之處。目今交換票據分劃頭與匯劃兩種，故在會員莊蓋章之下，更印紅字劃頭或匯劃字樣。表之下端在錢業準備庫一行下，左印紅字「今日軋收」四字，右印「今日軋付」四字，蓋用以塡寫收付差額者。末行爲合計，如收付兩方總數相等，即表示計算無誤。</p>
<p>「票據交換公單報吿表」大略相彷於票據交換所之「交換差額計算表」，故此表之採用，就錢業票據交換方法而論，實爲趨向科學化交換方法之一大進步。惟此兩者在內容上尙有繁簡之不同：第一，交換差額計算表中尙有「號數」一欄及借方貸方各有「張數」一欄；第二，交換差額計算表在合計之下，尙有四行，第一行爲「第口决交換應口差額」第二行爲「第一次交換總數」，第三行爲「第二次交換總數」，第四行爲「本日總結應口差額」。但在方法上論，目今錢業準備庫之交換方法，與票據交換所之方法，大體雷同矣。</p>
<p>錢業向富保守色彩，故在此項改革之後，有一部份會員莊認爲手續冗繁，因而要求改善。錢業公會乃於六月十七日召集各會員莊代表開會研究。各莊所提意見計有四種：（一）主張仍用票據交換公單報吿表，應由各莊軋準數字，交入錢庫；（二）規定收票時間，恢復公單制度而改善之；（三）採用票據交換所交換辦法；（四）交換時間延長半小時，互收軋過，每莊開公單一張。而金源莊亦提出公單問題改革草案：（一）組織委員會釐定票據交換時間增加交換次數；（二）公單改稱同業軋賬計數單及交換辦法等。此决會議結果，組織一「公單問題研究委員會」，推選委員九人，計各莊七人，錢庫二人，於六月二十四開一决會議，現定於七月十日開第二决會議。錢業票據交換方法將來是吾恢復原有辦法，或沿用現行辦法，抑或採用票據交換所辦法，尙未可知，筆者爲愛護錢業起見，願供一得之愚。（未完）</p>

<h3>與自然交朋友</h3>
<p>— 楊靈霄</p>
<p>小　朋友，在自然這一科裏，是你們所有的功課之中，要算是最有趣味的吧！因爲它會告訴你天空中風呀，雲呀，雨呀，雪呀，各種自然界的來歴。它會告訴你地面上各種奇奇怪怪的動物和植物的發生和變化。它又會告訴你地層內的黃金白銀等等的寶藏、它又會告訴你電車汽車等發動行走的原理。而且有時候還會告訴你幾套有趣的科學把戲。</p>
<p>俁中有許多小朋友見了這一課非但沒有感到興趣，反有厭惡的心理，這是什麼道理呢？原因是在於他們走錯了研究的路徑了，生疏的名詞，呆板的課文，不管三七廿一地把它硬記，死讀，弄得頭昏目眩，挖枯了大腦，結果還是不明暸個中的道理，這有什麼用呢？</p>
<p>小朋友，自然的一課是要有研究的心理，不必要去死讀，只要時常觀察，自然界中的一草一木，甚至於一塊泥，一塊石頭，都是研究自然的活課本。其决要用你的大腦很細心的推想，再動自己的雙手去做。道樣想想做做做做又想想，那末你的興趣自然會增加起來，內中它所講到的道理也自然會明白了。對於這一課，我們可不要性急，不要粗率，必須要耐心地去觀察和試騐，不明瞭，再看看，再看看。失敗了，不要灰心，再來想想，再來試試，這樣下去，終會給你明白的。你看世界上那一個發明家不是經過一决二次，以至十决百次千决萬次試騐而成功的呢？</p>
<p>總之研究自然要不怕難，不死讀課本，要聯合了手和腦，從做的方而去追求道理，要有試而再試的決心，碰到了挫折不要屈服。這樣一天天的幹下去，那你起先不高興和它交朋友的自然，就會不知不覺地和它結成一個好朋友了。</p>
<h3>少年鼓手</h3>
<p>— 禮義</p>
<p>稱　雄一世的拿破侖，在進攻奧地利時與奧國名將墨拉斯交戰，不幸地在麥萊古地方打敗了！他手下的名將德撒，率領了殘敗的軍隊，在一個高邱前暫駐，拿破侖站在高邱上，眼見得自已的軍隊敗得不成樣子，便對身旁的少年鼓手道：「擊退兵的鼓吧」！</p>
<p>這少年鼓手曾經參加過不少大戰，他是那麼地勇敢，雖然他的年紀很小，他當下聽了，便拿起鼓槌，走到拿破侖面前說道：「將軍，退兵鼓我不知道怎樣擊法，我只會擊衝鋒的鼓，我擊着鼓使戰士前仆後繼，勇往直前；我在金字塔旁擊過這樣的鼓，在泰泊山上擊過這樣的鼓，又在羅地橋下擊過這樣的鼓，我耍不耍再在這裏擊這樣的鼓？」</p>
<p>拿破崙了很感動，遂向德撒道：「我們打敗了，怎麼樣呢？」德撒立刻回答道：「怎麼樣麼？我們來打敗他們吧！鼓手！擊衝鋒鼓！」</p>
<p>於是殘敗的軍隊都轉身前進，德撒不幸地在第一排槍時陣亡了，拿破侖的軍隊個個奮不顧身，終於得到了全勝，這就是歷史上有名的麥萊古大勝。後世人說起麥萊古一仗，總不絕地稱讚拿破侖的英武，誰知道這完全是少年鼓手之力呢</p>
<p>小朋友！你們看了上文作何感想？</p>
<h3>三弟的留級</h3>
<p>— 心田</p>
<p>三　北校中來了一封信。裏而除了一張成績單，一紙繳費單之外外還多了一張小小的紙條。當時我還以爲這一定又是什麼學費加價之類的東西，誰知拆開一看却使我吃了一驚。上面寫着：「……貴府學生××，本學期考試，成績未能合格，按敎育部規定，下學期仍令在原級續書，即希台察……。」三弟立在我的旁邊，正將全神貫注在成績單上。突找發現我吃驚的姿態，連忙視綫移了過來，我怕他看見會受到重大的刺激，便隨手將它摺起；但是不巧得很，關鍵已被他知道了。隨即他伸過手來將紙拿了過去，接着便哭泣</p>
<p>凡小孩子的心靈都是很脆弱的、在悲哀到不能抑制的時候，便只得用哭泣來發洩。我知道安慰是無用了，還是讓他發洩一下吧。但是當我一掉頭看見三弟面上那種羞愧交織的神情時，我却不由不想起他平日讀書的情形來了。的確，三弟在家中是最喜讀書的人，平時不大玩耍。記得在考試前幾天，讀書竟至徹夜不睡，當時父親還說他成績必定駕乎我們之上，誰料在揭曉之後，却徧徧他遭到了這樣的厄運。</p>
<p>由於這些，我對三北留級的事情便發生了懊疑。於是便開口問他：「三弟，別哭。我有話和你說。你這次考試，在事前不是準備得十分充足的嗎？怎麼還會不及格的呢。三弟一面揩拭着眼淚，一面求助似地望着我。「我實在胆子太小；在考試那一天，我非常害怕，又因爲沒有好好的睡過覺，頭昏得厲害，考卷上的題目不知道怎樣對答，讀過的東西在那時彷彿都忘記完了。想又想不出，時間却不早了。心一急，只得胡亂交卷。結果竟……「說着淚水又湧出來了。我聽着他這一篇理由，才知道他留級的原因。便勸吿他道：「三弟，我明白了。你這决的留級，根本的原因實在是由於你誤解了「求學」的意義的緣故。以爲求學無非是爲的考試，只耍分數多。升級，學問就求得了。其實他決不如此簡單。若要分數，只要升級，考試時儘多作弊的人。所以分數決不是重要的東西，求知識才是最重要的工作。你到學校裏去，只要能求得實用的知識，其他的一切都不必管。考試不過是測量你知識多寡的一個工具，平時你能把這些點子連出一條捉小兔最近的路綫嗎？　亦人作勤學的人一定可以及格，所以你對考試切勿看得太重而害怕。心放寬一點，胆子自然就會放大；日夜車不開，頭昏腦脹的事情當然也不會發生。這一次的留級，是使你改變的原動力。假使你從今以後能够立志改變你求學的態度，切實依照我的話去做。那末這一次的留級，對於你決不是一件可恥的事情。」說完，我莊嚴地看了他一下。在短短的一瞥中，我似乎覺得我已經得到了寳貴的收獲。</p>
<h3>在人多的地主爲什麼很易頭痛？</h3>
<p>— 百里</p>
<p>明　兒和爸爸到戲院去看電影，回家後明兒祇是喊頭痛，爸爸說：「一定是看電影把頭看痛」</p>
<p>「看電影也會頭痛嗎？」明兒驚奇的問。</p>
<p>「是的，因爲電影院內人太多了，並且空氣很不流動，這是很易感到頭痛的，你若一人在一個小屋內，不使空氣流動，那麼，不久你就感到頭痛了，這是因屋內有穢濁空氣之故，在這人多的電影院裏，空氣當然更加穢濁了，」爸爸喝了一口茶接着說「這穢濁的空氣，是由我們體內排洩出來的無用而有害的廢物，無論怎樣淸潔的人，也耍有這種排洩作用。但是我們還要曉得到底是那一種的排洩物能使空氣穢濁，結果知道是皮膚的排洩物，允其是不潔皮膚的排洩物，更易使空氣穢濁。我們吸了這穢濁的空氣後，就能使腦部血管周流不暢，因此我們就感頭痛了。」爸爸這樣的一解說，明兒才明白了。</p>
<h3>扇的自述</h3>
<p>— 張希賢</p>
<p>我　是一把美麗的小扇子。我的主人年紀還小，所以，我稱他小主人。</p>
<p>小主人待我很好，他珍重的把我放在一隻特製的厘子裏。現在天氣很熱，小主人把我從匣子裏拿出來，放在身邊，帶到學校裏。小主人稱讚我的靈便和美麗。其餘的孩子們看着我嘖嘖稱羨，我高興極了，現在我把我過去的歷史，叙述出來吧：</p>
<p>我是在某公司裏的橱窗內的扇子，好久，有母子兩人出重價來買我，公司裏的職員，立即把我交給他。他很是愛我，所以我一直到如今，還過着快樂的生活呢。</p>
<p>下雨後的問題　林仁</p>
<p>夏　天的氣候眞會變化，趁它高與的時候，把烏雲吹到不知那裏去，讓炎熱的太陽射到地面上來；當它一不高興，便呼風喚雲，把大雨傾盆似的倒下來，但雨也不會下得過久的，一忽兒叉雨過天晴了。</p>
<p>當一下了雨，便引起了阿亮不少的問題，在他腦海中打着轉。有一天下午，正下着大雨，他便向正在寫字的爸爸問着：</p>
<p>「爸爸！雨爲什麼要一滴滴的落？有沒有一塊塊落下的雨？」</p>
<p>他爸爸聽到了這問題，正暗笑着，虧他想得出這樣的問題來，然而也並不怎樣的覺得厭惡，反感覺到他兒子肯用腦子，能想出這種比較有意義的問題來，心中很爲欣悅。他便想了一想，笑喀喀的對他說：</p>
<p>「在回答你這個問題以前，你可知道怎麼會有雨的道理嗎？」</p>
<p>「我知道的，自然課的張先生會對我們說：當河裏的水被太陽晒得很熱，水就化成水蒸汽，一直向天空昇去，可是天愈高，上面的溫度也愈冷，當水蒸汽碰到了冷，便凝結起來，這樣就變成了雨滴，落下來。可是他祇講到道裹，沒有吿訴我們雨爲什麼一滴一滴的落下來的緣故？」阿亮一口氣像背書一般的答了出來。</p>
<p>「你有沒有想過？當水蒸汽碰到了冷，怎麼會凝結成雨滴？這因爲天空中有不知道多少的灰塵粒子，而雨滴就是水蒸汽凝結在一粒粒的灰塵上，這當然便成一滴一滴的了。就是雨最初落下的時候，算它一塊一塊的，但是空氣是有摩擦力的，而雨塊落下來，必定要經過空氣，受到了空氣的摩擦力，仍舊要把雨塊分成一滴一滴。舉個例子來說得明白些：噴水池噴出的水不是成一根直綫噴上去嗎？但水噴到很高處而落下來的時候，水便不再成一綫，而變成一滴滴一的了。」</p>
<p>「爸爸，今天落了這麼多的雨水，流到那裹去的呢？」阿亮又問到別處去了。</p>
<p>「落下來的雨水，一分流到溝陰裏，全上海陰溝的水，跟着陰溝流到海洋裏去；一部分落在泥土裏，而泥土裏有着許多樹木花草植物的根。根是有吸收水的本領，把水吸到樹身和葉子裏去，那棵樹便不會乾死了：一部分水流到小河裏；也有一部分水落到地面上的時候，隨即被太陽晒成水蒸汽。所以流到海洋裏去的水，也只有全雨量的一半罷了」。</p>
<p>「那麼世界上有沒有永遠不落雨的方？」阿亮又問了一個問題。</p>
<p>「世界上是沒有一處不落雨的，就是沙漠中，耍算是最乾燥的地方，但有時也要發大風落大雨的，像非洲撒哈刺大澳漠，並不完全不落雨，不過下雨的機會很少，甚至每隔幾年才下一决雨。那邊的人看見了水，像我們看見金子是同樣的重視。」</p>
<p>阿亮聽得很有趣味，當他講完了這話，便握上了筆叉在寫字了，他也不好意思，再去打斷他爸爸的寫字。</p>

<h3>卓別麟的怪癖</h3>
<p>— 成偉</p>
<p>自古以來，天才者莫不生性怪癖，卓別麟自然也不能例外。而且比別人格外的多，現在讓我來吿訴諸位聽：</p>
<p>愛好運動　愛好孤獨的他，時常單獨地到外面散步，興致好起來一走便是十五英里，然後打個電話，請他的汽車夫來接，有時在回家的途中，往往棄車而徒步，讓車夫先開車回去。他以爲高爾夫球是呆子的遊戲，因爲把球打出去後再設法尋找，未免有點笑話。十七歲時以門外漢資格參加英國廿六哩馬拉松長途賽跑，竟得第二名，他愛游泳和棒球，但對足球則叉視爲笨人遊戲之一。他玩撲克牌的手法很高明，但時間最多不過半小時，賭博向來不大喜歡，但對股票市塲投機每决總在數千元以上的。</p>
<p>貪吃成病　吃東西非常隨便，淸煮的牛胃與羊肉最配他胃口，對於咖喱嗜之若命，越辣越好。有時他能在廿四小時內不吃東西，而到了第二天連吃四五餐之多，他最怕生病，可是往往爲了所吃的菜配他胃口，一口氣連添四五决，結果又是一塲大病。他從沒有進過學校，可是有三千冊藏書，隨時翻閱自修，他最喜讀聖經，但自己並不信仰任何宗敎，常常突然的想着去做禮拜，就不管三七廿一跑到敎堂裏去，可是所進的敎堂及所做的禮拜是屬於那一敎？等他做完了跟着人家出來，連他自己也莫明其妙。</p>
<p>利慾澹薄　他的左手比校靈活，但是兩手都能寫字，所寫的並不多，過去十年中，他的親筆函件不到十二封，他所寫的句子都很短——大概五六個字，他從未受過音樂敎育，可是對於各種琴都很熟練，他在家里彈奏「管風琴」起來，總是三四個鐘頭，奏提琴時以左手執弓，右手按絃，粗細絃錢的排列和普通的相反，他很有錢，所以對於利慾澹薄得很，高興工作的時候很難得，攝影塲裏的人常常「連幾個月祗吃飯不做事，由卓別麟支付全薪。等他心血來潮，想到拍戲的時候，他就突然在攝影塲裏出現，瘋在似的督促人家工作，幾乎把十天的工作併在一天內做完，弄得人人汗流浹背，他自己也精疲力盡！</p>
<p>出浴高歌　他的住宅很大，裏面只住着他自己和六个男僕，女性除了自己的親屬外，難得在他家出入。他不肯讓別人生火爐，一定要自己動手才行。壁爐的燃料是大塊的礦煤，木柴是不許燒的。他每天須洗四次澡，早起時一次，中午一次，晚飯前一决，臨睡前叉是一次，在浴缸裏總要提高嗓子唱歌，唱的是上低音有調無詞，南腔北調無所不唱。晚上，穿着鮮豔的浴衣將自己反鎖在臥室裏，每扇門他都親自鎖上，連通浴室的那扇門也牢牢關住，至於窗子那是全夜開通的。</p>
<p>細讀報紙　每天早晨醒了以後，他的僕人就將早餐和兩份報紙送到他未前，他一面吃一面看報，報上所有的東西他都一一細讀，如果他覺得社論或是新聞寫得不好，就會因此發怒而大罵新聞記者。他的睡衣大的有兩打以上之多，起身時，總先把兩脚跨到臥床的右邊，踏在固定的地方，如果僕人不留意把貓皮毯子放錯了地方，他整天要感到非常的不快。總之，他是一個傑出的怪物，他的怪癖眞是寫不完的多，因爲篇幅小的緣故，祗得很簡略的寫了這幾點。</p>

<p>余好習琴，苦乏師友，暇輒假書籍及唱片以探求，積久漸有所知，乃筆之於書，茲錄數則，以實游藝界，藉與同好者商討。</p>
<p>京胡分梅孫兩派，人所共知，孫派重剛，其奏琴雄邁絕一倫，饒有勇氣，故其音朗若貫珠，氣勢允爲活潑，王少卿傳其技。梅派之琴重柔，其奏以穩厚勝，邈邈綿綿，含蓄無盡，胡鐵芬得其傳。初學琴者，當以梅派爲宗，取其法度，稍進，再效孫派，得其剛勁，則盡善矣！</p>
<p>託腔之法，大抵以「包隨墊補」四字，可以盡之，試釋其意：</p>
<p>包－以多數音包少數音也。如西皮旦唱之下句落腔，恒爲「工六」，京胡上則以「工五六」包之，或腔爲「六乙四」，則以「六四乙尺四」包之。</p>

<p>第十二章　盡如寗武可奈何</p>
<p>前天，又得到你的來書，責備我不肯出來殺賊。我心裏何等的難過，遂先打發差官回來復命，而小弟就在夜間帶了寳劍鏢囊，不別而行，祇好丟下姑母不管，而到寗武關來助戰，以明心跡，希奏膚功。行至代州城外，遇見一小隊賊兵，被我殺死數賊，搶得一匹駿馬趕來。恰巧在此間救了靖哥，這豈非是天意嗎？但不知寗武關上情形如何？可還能守得住？」許靖道：「原來賢弟有此苦衷，我倒錯怪你了。」遂又將關中緊急的情形奉吿。說了許多話，更覺疲乏，支持不住，遂先把戰鎧解脫，又將赤鳳寳劍掛在壁上，一回頭見東壁有一禪榻，脚步歪斜的走過去，橫身睡下。又嘆了一口氣說道：「臂上疼痛得很，人也十分疲乏，我倦欲眠，只得偃臥了。」柳隱英道：「靖哥，你的傷勢不輕，睡息一下，也好。此間沒有金創良藥，吾則早給你塗上了。賊將可惡之至，小弟未曾將他殺死，太便宜他了。」許靖道：「一隻虎中了你一鏢回去也不得安寗，也給他吃些苦頭。但願周將軍能够堅守。待我休息一回，再和賢弟殺回去，相助周將軍殺賊。」柳隱英道：」很好，你再閉目安睡，小弟在此保護，料流寇決不會殺上這裏來的。」說話時老和尙已用木盤托着一甌粥來，還有一碟鹽菜，放在桌上，說道：「寺中沒有可口的菜，此地叉無買處，請二位將軍就吃些吧。」柳隱英道：「有勞你了。」遂代許靖盛了一碗，給許靖坐在榻上吃。自己也盛着粥吃。許靖吃了二碗，已覺腹飽，不要再吃。柳隱英也吃了兩碗放下，讓老和尙收去。柳隱英叉敎許靖安睡。許靖神思已倦，閉着雙目，沈沈睡去。（一一四）</p>

        <h1>1941.07.13</h1>
<h3>England, America, and the Soviet Union to Cooperate in Preventing Japan's Southern Advance</h3>
<p>International News Agency, Washington, 12th: Diplomatic circles here predict that if Japan advances southward, England, America, and the Soviet Union may cooperate closely. It is widely believed that President Roosevelt had a lengthy meeting with Soviet Ambassador Oumansky on Thursday, presumably to discuss various possible changes in the Far East, including the Soviet Union's role in the event of new Japanese actions. However, reports indicate that the meeting primarily aimed to accelerate aid to the Soviet Union. The State Department's public statements have not provoked Japan, but the aid plan for the Soviet Union is reportedly being effectively accelerated. Regarding military supplies, it is generally acknowledged that the United States, in providing them to the Soviet Union, will not compromise its national defense program or aid to England plan.</p>
<h3>German-Soviet War Enters Second Phase: Soviet High Command Reorganized; Three Pillars of the Red Army Appointed Front Commanders; Eight Million Soldiers Deployed to the Front Line for a Decisive Battle</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 12th: The Soviet Defense Committee, recognizing that the front is now divided into three lines, has specially ordered the Supreme Command to establish three command headquarters to expedite the defeat of the enemy: (1) Marshal Voroshilov has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Northwest Command; (2) Marshal Timoshenko, Chairman of the Defense Committee, has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the West Command; (3) Marshal Budyonny has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Southwest Command.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th: Moscow Radio announced last night that Generals Voroshilov, Timoshenko, and Budyonny have been appointed as Commanders-in-Chief of the Northwest, West, and Southwest sectors of the front lines, respectively, and have already taken office. These three generals are the three pillars of the Soviet defense organization. Voroshilov was appointed Chairman of the Defense Committee on August 7, 1940, and a member of the Defense Council on July 1st of this year. Timoshenko succeeded Voroshilov as Chairman of the Defense Committee on July 8th of this year. General Budyonny is the Chief of Cavalry of the Red Army, having made great contributions during the Civil War. He was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Defense Committee on August 16th of last year.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th: It is reported that the commanders of both the Soviet and German armies are taking advantage of the lull before the storm to deploy fresh troops to the front lines. Ankara Radio broadcast recent news from Moscow stating that the Soviet Union has recently mobilized no less than eight million troops, who are now heading to the front lines. London believes that a new German offensive is about to begin, and the current lull may be due to the exhaustion of German tank crews.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th: In the past thirty-six hours, there have been no major changes on the Eastern Front. The Soviet troops under the command of the three headquarters are now preparing for the second phase of the war. It is reported that the head of the Soviet Information Bureau, Mr. Lozovsky, told reporters that the situation would become clear within three weeks. According to Moscow Radio, Red Army reconnaissance teams infiltrated behind enemy lines and obtained valuable documents when they attacked a German headquarters.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th: The "Daily Telegraph" commented on the current state of the German-Soviet war lull, saying that there is ample reason to believe that the next phase of this great war will be even more intense than the first. Although the aggressors may be inclined to retreat, they cannot afford to back down now. The consequences of the risks they are now taking are either victory or utter defeat. This large-scale war cannot end with a return to the status quo. If Germany fails, the dream of Nazi domination of the world will collapse. The labor and financial costs of this war are difficult to estimate. Therefore, Britain feels morally obligated to redouble its efforts to bomb German ports, industrial centers, and transportation routes while the German-Soviet war is still undecided.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th: The Soviet Information Bureau recently issued a bulletin stating that on the evening of July 11th, there were no changes in the positions of our troops on all fronts. Our air force continued to strike enemy tank columns and motorized and mechanized units. Enemy airfields and the Ploesti oil fields in Romania were also bombed by our aircraft. On July 11th, our air force shot down a total of sixty-five enemy planes, and nineteen of our planes went missing. According to Soviet Information Bureau Deputy Director Lozovsky, the Germans have used poison gas in some areas, and we have not yet retaliated. We made this warning in the bulletin of June 25th.</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 12th: Last night's communiqué was very brief, similar to the previous night's, indicating that the massive offensive on the German-Soviet front has temporarily halted. The Soviet army, initially caught off guard and penetrated by the German army, now appears to have regrouped and gathered strength along its old, strongest defense lines, confronting the German army. According to Soviet sources, this line has not yet been broken.</p>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 12th: The "Morgenpost" stated yesterday that the Soviet Union is now organizing a strong new defense behind the Stalin Line. This suggests that Germany has not yet broken through the final consolidated Soviet defense line. The newspaper also stated that Moscow's troop numbers are certainly sufficient and can temporarily halt the German advance, but the German victories at Bialystok and Minsk have sufficiently proven that all Soviet resistance will fail.</p>
<h3>Giant Iron Fist Shatters Illusions: German Offensive Halted</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 12th: "Red Star" commented, "The iron fist of the Soviet giant has shattered the illusions of Hitler's soldiers about being 'invincible' and 'lightning-fast.' The world must now learn from Germany that Red Army soldiers do not fear so-called 'breakthrough' and 'pincer' tactics. They will not waver or be discouraged. We know the enemy well, and we also know the enemy's tricks well. The enemy is still trying to make a desperate gamble, but its 'invincibility' has been shattered, and the enemy has tasted the great power of the Red Army."</p>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 12th: The German official news agency stated that the German offensive on the German-Soviet front has been hindered by blocked roads. The German army has been operating on this line for several days, attempting to completely eliminate the surrounded Soviet forces in the Minsk and Bialystok areas. However, because the roads are completely blocked by the piled-up remains of Soviet tanks and other vehicles, it is temporarily unable to advance. It also stated that if the German army wants to continue to advance, it must first move the mountain of war equipment aside.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Organizes Special Forces, Resolves to Defend Leningrad with All Its Might</h3>
<p>Havas, Helsinki, 12th: According to "Pravda," the Soviet Union is currently organizing special forces called "Extermination and Defense Units" to defend Leningrad. Most of them are revolutionary soldiers from 1917-1919. The newspaper also urged the government to eliminate the remnants of the bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th: Moscow Radio reported that yesterday's "Pravda" editorial reiterated Stalin's statement that the most elite German divisions have been crushed, but warned the Soviet people, "Fierce battles lie ahead. We will not simply harass the enemy but defeat them."</p>
<h3>Enormous Sacrifices in Initial Stages of War: One Million German Troops Killed or Wounded in Invasion of Soviet Union</h3>
<p>United Press, London, 12th: Yesterday, the impression here among experts was that the actions of the Nazi army in recent days have been aimed at finding the "weak points" in the Red Army's defense line, similar to Sedan in France. The Soviet defense has undoubtedly inflicted enormous sacrifices on the Nazis in the initial stages of the war. According to sources, there are no signs of a lack of material or manpower on the German side. Military observers say that if the "weak point" can be found and properly exploited, the entire defense line from Finland to the Black Sea is threatened. It is widely believed that a new offensive will occur in the central part of the front line, where the Germans are strongest, apart from the small Baltic states. Key points in the central line include Bobruisk and the Lepel sector. Soviet troops have been transferred to defend Bobruisk and Lepel and have launched successful counterattacks. The situation in Bobruisk is unclear. It is heard that military experts say that the German army has made slight progress in the past few days.</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 12th: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Lozovsky announced that since the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the number of German troops killed or wounded has exceeded one million. (Note: The German government news agency also stated that the number of Soviet soldiers killed, wounded, and captured has reached one million.)</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Encirclement Battle in Minsk Area: Germany Boasts of Unprecedented Victory</h3>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 11th: The local radio station has just announced that "the collapse of the Soviet Union is only a matter of time. The victories won by the German army in the Bialystok and Minsk areas are almost unprecedented. Strategy is a great art, and its goal is not to occupy important strongholds, but to encircle and annihilate the enemy. The Battle of Cannae by Hannibal in ancient times, the Battle of Tannenberg by General Hindenburg in modern times, and the recent battles by the German army in the Vistula River basin in Poland, the Flanders region in Belgium, and Bialystok in this war, are all evidence of this. Four hundred thousand Soviet troops have been captured, and the total losses are over five hundred thousand. Seventy-three squadrons of Soviet aircraft have also been lost."</p>
<h3>Abundant Natural Resources: Soviet Union Lays Foundation for Victory</h3>
<p>Havas, Chongqing, 12th: The "Central Daily News" today commented on the German-Soviet war under the title "The Soviet Union Has Laid the Foundation for Victory." The article stated, "We believe that after three weeks of fighting, the Soviet Union's final victory is guaranteed. This is entirely based on the results of the battle, not on emotional arguments." It also stated, "Consolidating the defenses of the Maritime Province in the Pacific, preventing Japan from taking advantage of any opportunity, ensuring the American supply line, exhausting the German army as much as possible, luring them deep into the country, and then using the terrain, manpower, and material resources to defeat them in one fell swoop is the only strategy for the Soviet Union to win. The Soviet army has achieved victories on various lines in recent days, and Germany's internal weaknesses have become increasingly exposed. The success of the Soviet army's war has further proven this. The German army will inevitably engage in a desperate struggle, but the Soviet Union's final victory has laid its unshakable foundation."

<h3>President Roosevelt Cables Kalinin Expressing Sympathy for the Soviet Union and Wishing Them Success in Their Struggle</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 12th: Soviet Supreme Soviet Presidium Chairman Kalinin and US President Roosevelt recently exchanged cables. Kalinin's cable to Roosevelt stated, "As your country celebrates its Independence Day, I would like to ask you to accept the sincere congratulations of the Soviet people, who are fighting with weapons for freedom against the common enemy of progressive humanity, the German fascist rulers. I wish you and the great American people a bright future." Roosevelt replied, "I am very grateful for the congratulatory cable for our country's Independence Day. I am deeply impressed by the Russian people's heroic fight against the cruel invaders. The American people abhor armed aggression, and the friendship between the American and Soviet peoples is deeply rooted. The Russian people are now fighting bravely for self-defense and will surely receive our sympathy and admiration. I hereby extend, on behalf of the American people, my congratulations to the people of your country for their success in their struggle."</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Germany's Hidden Worries</h3>
<p>Reviewing the German-Soviet war situation over the past week, the main German offensive remains stuck on a line stretching from Ostrov in the north, through Lepel, Borisov, and Bobruisk in the center, to Novograd-Volynsky in the south. This is almost unchanged from last week's situation. News reports indicate that the front-line fighting has even quieted down in recent days. This fact proves that the first phase of the German offensive has clearly encountered a setback. One side needs to consolidate the captured positions and maintain the rear transportation that is constantly disrupted by the Red Army, while the other side needs to replenish or replace the exhausted front-line troops in order to carry out the next offensive. However, at the moment when the German offensive temporarily halted, the Soviet Union has used its strict organizational structure and exerted its extraordinary organizational power to mobilize millions of troops domestically. At the same time, it has divided the long front line into three major war zones, with the "three pillars" of the Red Army, Voroshilov, Timoshenko, and Budyonny, each in command. Moreover, the scorched earth policy and guerrilla tactics announced by Stalin have also played a major role on the front lines. Therefore, not only has the Red Army achieved a stable position on all front lines, but it can even launch powerful counterattacks from time to time, forcing Hitler to temporarily slow down his blitzkrieg in order to re-examine his future battle plans. From the perspective of the anti-aggression front, this can be said to have gained some advantage in time.</p>
<p>Thinking from Hitler's perspective, since he made the bold statement that he would end the war against the Soviet Union in eight weeks, he will have to intensify his operations in the future to avoid damaging his prestige. Moreover, if the German-Soviet war cannot be resolved quickly, then once England and the United States are ready and officially launch a Western Front offensive, the Axis powers will truly face the crisis of fighting on two fronts. At that time, it will not only be a loss of prestige, but also the military advantages that have been painstakingly gained over the past two years will be completely destroyed. Only victory is allowed, not defeat, and it must be a "quick victory," not allowed to be prolonged. If military progress is gradually made, but in reality it turns into a long-term war of attrition like the Sino-Japanese War, then for Germany, which is facing enemies on two fronts, it is still an unsolvable situation. Therefore, it is conceivable that Hitler is taking advantage of the temporary lull on the front lines to actively plan his next actions, and it is also possible to imagine how panicked and anxious he is internally.</p>
<p>First, he will certainly try his best to encourage Japan to lend him a helping hand in the Far East, but the crux of the matter is whether the German army can drive straight in and quickly seize victory. Assuming that the German-Soviet war falls into a stalemate, then the clever and exhausted Japan will certainly have no ability to once again pull chestnuts out of the fire for the Axis powers. In particular, Japan has been fooled by the Axis powers more than once in the past. If there is no definite certainty in the future, how can it and how dare it act recklessly again? At most, it will continue its policy of fishing in troubled waters and further exploit the isolated and helpless Vietnam. As for a formal southward or northward advance, it will at least have to wait until the German army has captured Moscow.</p>
<p>Second, when Hitler launched his offensive against the Soviet Union on June 22, he used the fierce strategy of a full-line offensive. At that time, it was indeed aggressive and seemed to possess immense power. If the Red Army had not been of good quality, the Soviet Union at this time would have long followed in the footsteps of Poland or France. However, after three weeks of impact, Hitler must have realized that this "full-scale offensive" strategy cannot defeat a strong enemy with organization, strength, and abundant reserves. In the future, in order to remedy this, he may have to change his strategy, concentrate his forces to attack several key targets. In other words, instead of fighting along a long front line of fifteen hundred miles, which results in the dispersal of forces and the emptiness of the rear, it would seem easier to concentrate all efforts to launch fierce attacks on one or two important strongholds. It is a pity that time is not forgiving. If Hitler had concentrated a hundred or so divisions of troops on June 22 to attack the Minsk line, the Red Army, caught off guard, would have found it difficult to defend firmly. The German "blitz" units would have already approached Moscow at this time. But if this strategy is to be used today, it is not only difficult in practice to gather so many troops, but also under the conditions that the Soviet Union's mobilization has long been completed and the Red Army's manpower and material resources are infinitely supplied, I am afraid that before the Nazi military authorities change their course, the Soviet side will have already preempted and attacked the lightly defended enemy territory.</p>
<p>Third, Hitler, seeing that the war inside the Soviet Union is in danger of turning into a long-term war of attrition, may he also rashly want to win by surprise, and attempt to "open up new paths" in other directions? From the reports that the German army concentrated on the Bulgarian border in an attempt to invade the Turkish Straits, it can be seen that Hitler, in the midst of being unable to advance or retreat, does have the possibility of taking small countries as meat to save his prestige. However, regarding this, although it seems easy, it is actually difficult in many ways. First, Turkey may not submit, and if it turns its back, its combat power can at least be compared with Greece. Second, the Syrian war is coming to an end, and the British Middle East Army, after more than a month of rest and replenishment, can once again step onto the European battlefield to help the Soviet Union and Turkey resist the war. Third, the cooperation between England and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly strong. Recently, there were even rumors that England and the Soviet Union asked Iran to allow them to pass troops through their territory, which shows that if the German army launches a new offensive in the Eastern Mediterranean again, it will only encounter more thorns and more dangers in the future.</p>
<p>From the above, it is not difficult to imagine the depression that Hitler has felt due to the failure to resolve the war against the Soviet Union quickly. If we add to this the increasingly active attitude of the United States in recent days, such as the US Navy taking over the defense of Iceland, American workers participating in military projects at more than fifty British bases, and American ships once firing warning shots at German submarines in the Atlantic Ocean, all of this certainly made Hitler realize that a terrible "incident" was about to occur on the Western Front. Assuming that in the near future, he really needs to face the united front of England, the United States, and the Soviet Union on both the east and west sides, then even if the entire Axis organization does not collapse immediately, at least the end of Nazi hegemony will be near.</p>

They strongly denied the French claim that the Japanese fired first, stating that the Japanese were not carrying weapons and were shot at by French Concession police. French officials presented weapons allegedly seized from the Japanese as evidence. The statement also stated that if the French authorities refuse to acknowledge the facts of the case, the Japanese naval authorities cannot remain indifferent.

<p>Hankou. A shooting incident occurred in the Hankou French Concession, resulting in the death of one Japanese individual and serious injuries to one Vietnamese policeman. Afterwards, five Japanese were arrested. The Japanese military spokesperson here declared today that if the French authorities do not unconditionally release these five Japanese individuals, the Japanese side will blockade the French Concession. The spokesperson declared that the Japanese authorities consider this shooting incident extremely serious. He stated that the arrested Japanese individuals are innocent and should be released unconditionally and not treated as prisoners to be handed over to the Japanese side. If the French side cannot adapt and change its current attitude and insists on treating the detained Japanese individuals as prisoners and requiring the Japanese side to accept them, the Japanese side may close all gates leading to the French Concession. The spokesperson specifically convened the press this afternoon to issue a statement to foreign reporters regarding the shooting incident in the French Concession. The spokesperson stated that at 1 AM this morning, three Japanese individuals, after a banquet at the railway hotel, went to the hotel's restroom and subsequently had a dispute with the Vietnamese police. The Vietnamese police called for reinforcements, surrounded the restroom, and opened fire, killing one Japanese individual and stabbing him with a bayonet. One Vietnamese policeman was also shot and seriously injured. The spokesperson insisted that the Vietnamese police fired the shot that injured their companion. The French authorities claim that the Japanese fired first. The Japanese spokesperson stated that the Japanese individuals did not have any firearms and therefore could not have fired the shots. The remaining five Japanese individuals were arrested by the French and are still being held in the French police station this afternoon. To avoid accidents, the French authorities closed all gates of the French Concession after the shooting incident, but reopened them at 10 AM this morning. (Associated Press, 12th)</p>

<h3>Syrian Authorities Issued Ceasefire Order Yesterday; Dentz Ordered to Handle Peace Negotiations as Opportunities Arise; Negotiations Underway</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th. According to news from London, the Syrian side issued a ceasefire order at midnight yesterday. Reuters, London, 12th. According to a dispatch from Jerusalem, the Syrian ceasefire order was issued at midnight yesterday. Sources there claim that a group of Vichy representatives passed through the Allied lines last night to discuss ceasefire terms.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Acre, 12th. General Wilson, commander of the Egyptian Central Army, assisted by General Catroux, leader of the Free French forces in Syria, began ceasefire negotiations here today with General Verdillac, representing Vichy. Havas, Vichy, 2nd. It is rumored that General Dentz, commander of the French forces in Syria, is in talks with the Central Army authorities in the area. Although this has not yet been confirmed, official sources say that it is not impossible for the two sides to make contact, as General Dentz has been authorized by the government since yesterday to take any necessary actions as opportunities arise. In short, after the French government rejected the British ceasefire terms, the Syrian issue has moved from the political stage to the military stage. Therefore, if the Syrian French Army General Staff deems it necessary, it can act independently to end the war.</p>
<p>The British Ceasefire Terms Include Eleven Articles</p>
<p>Havas, Vichy, 11th. Regarding the Syrian ceasefire issue, the British government sent a note through the American Embassy in France to the French government. The full text is as follows: "The British Embassy in the United States has notified the United States Department of State that the British government has received a letter from General Dentz, High Commissioner of France in Syria, and now hopes that the United States government will forward the following conditions to General Dentz as soon as possible: (1) The Allied forces have no other purpose in Syria other than to prevent the enemy from using it as a land and air force base to attack the Allied military position in the Near East. When the Allied forces entered Syria, they provided guarantees to the Arab people to maintain their independence. Regarding this matter, the British fully agree with the declaration made by General Catroux. In the future, France will be represented in Syria by the Free French authorities, which must not conflict with the independence of the two states of Syria and Lebanon. The British also support the independence of the two states. (2) The Allied forces have no resentment towards the French in Syria and are willing to forgive their last-ditch battle. There is no intention to prosecute any leaders, officials, or troops in Syria. General Catroux has never taken any adverse action against his comrades who fought against him under orders, and this decision is the same. (3) In order to prevent all weapons in Syria from being used by the enemy, the Allied forces must request to receive them. (4) The French forces in Syria must be allowed to freely join the Allied forces to fight against the Axis powers. At the same time, the Allied forces reserve the right to take steps to ensure that every soldier can freely choose. (5) Soldiers should be given full facilities to understand the current situation and the path to their choice. Those who do not wish to join the Allied forces should be sent back to their hometowns with their families when circumstances permit. (6) Soldiers who wish to join the Allied forces should be given honorable terms. Those accepted by the Allied forces will retain their original military rank and be observed for future performance. Other soldiers will be treated well before being sent back to their home countries. Officers who wish to assist the Allied forces will be given positions according to their original ranks and their salaries will be guaranteed. Conversely, those who do not wish to assist the Allied forces will be sent back to their home countries. (7) Structures such as railways, bridges, radio stations, and oil stations must not be destroyed and should be handed over for use by the Allied forces. The Allied forces have the right to place Syria under military occupation during the war. (8) All German and Italian nationals in Syria will be handed over to the Allied forces for confinement. (9) All warships must be handed over to the Allied forces intact and sailed to the port of Beirut for blockade and must not be sailed out arbitrarily. If required for safety, the Commander of the Mediterranean Fleet may order them to be sailed elsewhere, but they must be returned to a unified France after the war and compensated for any damage. (10) The blockade status of Syria and Lebanon should be lifted, and the two states should immediately join the sterling area. (11) All British prisoners should be released immediately. In addition, according to sources, some British officers have been transferred to France for confinement. Before their release, the British authorities believe it is necessary to confine some supporters of the Vichy government in Syria. It is hoped that the United States Department of State will explain this point to General Dentz when conveying the above conditions. Furthermore, if General Dentz can accept the above conditions as a basis for negotiations, the British military authorities are prepared to cease hostilities and immediately conduct negotiations with General Dentz's representatives. It is also hoped that this will be conveyed.</p>
<p>Vichy Rejects Under German Instructions</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Vichy, 12th. The original text of France's reply to the British ceasefire terms has been disclosed. The French government believes that the British demands are incompatible with all of France's mandate rights. France believes that it has a mission to liberate Syria and Lebanon and is willing to grant Syria and Lebanon independence, but when to grant independence should be chosen by France. The British government's declaration that Britain will liberate Syria and Lebanon is unfair. Furthermore, the French government cannot negotiate with General Catroux because he betrayed his country. The French government cannot sign ceasefire terms that are contrary to the interests of its country.</p>
<p>Havas, Vichy, 11th. The French government has rejected the British military authorities' ceasefire terms. The war in Syria is still ongoing. British troops are now approaching Beirut, and the army is in trouble and cannot receive supplies and reinforcements. According to responsible sources here, the terms proposed by the British are "unacceptable both in form and substance." The French government cannot use this as a basis for discussion. The British purpose is to seize Syria at a minimal cost. In addition, France's attitude towards the Catroux faction has long been known to the British. The British request that the Syrian military authorities directly negotiate with the Catroux faction's general staff is naturally unacceptable to the French government. People from all walks of life in France have expressed regret over the British attitude. France has the responsibility to govern Syria and has accepted the war to defend it. The British have declared that they have no territorial ambitions in Syria. If so, why should the British ask France to accept a point that honor does not permit, which is difficult to understand. This is probably also the consensus in diplomatic circles. Some neutral countries, such as the United States, have come forward to mediate between Britain and France, and the Vatican has also indirectly requested an end to the war in Syria, all supporting an early restoration of peace in Syria and continuing efforts to end the war. Furthermore, according to well-informed sources here, the French government has complete confidence in General Dentz, the French High Commissioner in Syria and Lebanon, to take any decisions necessary on the ground based on the military situation and current environment. In this regard, further negotiations between Britain and France are still possible.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that those closely watching the situation are not surprised by the issuance of the Syrian ceasefire order. General Dentz's request for a ceasefire a few days ago clearly indicates that the Vichy forces can no longer resist the pressure of the Allied forces, or that General Darlan's rejection of the ceasefire terms, deeming them unacceptable, was under the instructions of the German authorities. Vichy's rejection of the moderate terms proposed by the Allied forces has shifted the responsibility for surrender to General Dentz and the local Vichy authorities.</p>
<p>Resolution of the Syrian Situation Affects the Situation in the Middle East</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th. The Times reported that the Vichy government has rejected the ceasefire terms proposed by the Central Powers for Syria and has authorized General Dentz to continue the war with full powers. The significance of this matter is only that Vichy must handle it carefully to avoid offending the Germans. Whether Vichy's decision is due to wanting to please the Germans or being unwilling to deal with the Free French authorities, the military situation in Syria will eventually force it to surrender sooner or later. The delay in reaching a ceasefire agreement only creates unfortunate results: first, it prolongs hopeless resistance, and second, it allows the Vichy fleet time to escape to Turkish ports. The five weeks of military operations by the Allied forces in Syria seem to be undoubtedly within reach of victory. The immediate result is that the Germans have lost an important base, and the Germans have already used interference in Iraq, which may be further expanded. The potential threat northwest of the Suez Canal has been eliminated, and the entire military situation in the eastern Mediterranean has turned in our favor. It is hoped that negotiations to establish effective independence in Syria will begin immediately, the blockade will be lifted, Syria will be included in the sterling area, and Syria's full cooperation with Britain's war effort will enable it to develop close friendships with the Arab countries of the East. The resolution of many problems in the Middle East will also be made easy as a result.</p>

<p>Havas, Washington, 11th. President Roosevelt told reporters today that American workers are building naval bases all over the world, especially in Ireland, thereby fulfilling contracts permitted by the "Lend-Lease Act."

<h3>Brief History of the Three Soviet Supreme Commanders</h3>
<p>Voroshilov</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 12th. Soviet Grand Marshal Voroshilov is the most prominent figure in the Soviet Red Army. He was born in 1881 in the Donets Basin, an important industrial area of the country. He began his revolutionary activities early and worked hard to prepare for and organize the October Revolution. In 1918, when the German occupiers invaded Soviet Ukraine, Voroshilov displayed exceptional strategic skills, organizing countless Ukrainian worker-peasant guerrillas. In 1919, Voroshilov, together with Budyonny, commanded the First Cavalry Army and fought gloriously in the Caucasus and Donets Basin. He and Frunze were enthusiastic about reorganizing the Red Army. In 1925, Voroshilov was appointed Chairman of the People's Committee for Naval and Military Affairs and Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council. Later, he was appointed Chairman of the Soviet Defense Committee. Because of his outstanding service to the country, Voroshilov was awarded three Lenin Orders and four Red Banner Orders by the authorities. In 1935, he was awarded the title of Grand Marshal of the Soviet Union. In May 1940, he was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee and Chairman of the Defense Committee. He is currently a member of the Defense Committee.</p>
<p>Timoshenko</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 12th. Grand Marshal Timoshenko, Chairman of the Soviet People's Defense Committee, was born in 1895. His father was a poor peasant. In 1917, he participated in the revolutionary war. The following year, under the leadership of Stalin, he joined the war against Tsaritsyn. He was then appointed commander of the 4th Cavalry Regiment, defeating the Denikin army. After the success of the revolution, Grand Marshal Timoshenko returned to military school for further study. After graduation, he held various important positions. During the Soviet war against Finland, Marshal Timoshenko made many contributions and was awarded three Red Banner Orders and one Lenin Order. After the end of the Soviet-Finnish War, the Soviet Supreme Authority awarded him the title of "Hero of the Soviet Union." Last year, he was appointed Chairman of the Soviet People's Defense Committee.</p>
<p>Budyonny</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 10th. Soviet Grand Marshal Budyonny was born in 1883 in the Don Cossack region. His father was a landless farmer. He served in the Tsarist Russian army for fifty years. In 1919, Budyonny's cavalry army achieved excellent campaigns, defeating the troops of Generals Mamontov and Shkuro. In the autumn of that year, under the initiative of Stalin, the First Cavalry Army was established, and Budyonny was appointed leader of the team. The First Cavalry Army achieved glorious victories, defeating Denikin and other White Guards. After the revolutionary war, Budyonny successively served as commander of the cavalry army, member of the Soviet Revolutionary Military Council, inspector of the Red Army Cavalry, and commander of the Moscow Military District troops. Currently, he is Deputy Chairman of the Soviet People's Defense Committee. Budyonny has made important contributions to the improvement and technical equipment of the Red Army and its cavalry army. Due to his outstanding combat performance, Budyonny has been awarded two Lenin Orders and three Red Banner Orders. In 1935, the authorities awarded him the title of Grand Marshal of the Soviet Union</p>

Soviet observers said that if the Soviet army can stop the German advance, the autumn and winter rains in September may help the Soviet army defeat the German offensive.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Again Requests Funds from Congress, Totalling Over 800 Million for the Navy and Maritime Commission</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, December 12th: President Roosevelt yesterday requested Congress to approve appropriations and contract authorizations of $3,323,000,000 for the Navy and Maritime Commission, in addition to the $4,770,000,000 for the Army. The total defense funds requested by the President in the past 24 hours amount to $8,093,000,000. Yesterday's request included $1,625,000,000 in cash for the Navy, of which $400,000,000 is for maintaining and repairing defensive equipment on government-owned or privately-owned ships. Some reporters in the press box interpreted this move as arming merchant ships, but the President replied that this was not the intention. Most of this money will be used for naval vessels to install equipment that can withstand magnetic mines. The government also plans to transfer some private ships for naval use. He requested $698,000,000 from the Maritime Commission to enable the Commission to add many new ships. The message requesting new funds for the Lend-Lease Act is being drafted, but it may not be submitted to Congress this week. The supplementary tax bill has been submitted to Congress, and he expects another tax bill this winter. There will likely be a new tax bill every year. The requested funds do not include funds for repairing British ships. The production plan is now being rapidly implemented, and the funding process must be expanded, so funds are needed now and cannot wait until January next year, he said. The funds requested by the President yesterday stipulated $1,246,650,000 for the construction of 566 merchant ships, $350,000,000 for the acquisition, purchase and repair of existing ships, and $50,000,000 for adding shipbuilding equipment. According to the announcement of the Maritime Commission, the Commission has developed its plan and can start construction in early August. All ships under the new program are scheduled to be completed and operational by the end of 1943, with a total tonnage of 5,500,000 tons. This new program, coupled with those directly ordered by the UK from US shipyards, will deliver ships with a load capacity of 14,000,000 tons to the UK by the end of 1943.</p>
<h3>US Navy Secretary Announces US Ships Dropped Depth Charges to Warn Approaching Submarines in the Atlantic, But Denies Deliberately Firing on German Ships</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, December 12th: A congressman told the United Press yesterday that Navy Secretary Colonel Knox told the Senate Naval Committee yesterday that a naval patrol ship had fired a depth charge at an approaching submarine in the Atlantic as a "warning." Colonel Knox also said that US warships engaged in patrols had not deliberately opened fire on any German warships. The Naval Committee held a closed-door meeting for three hours, listening to Colonel Knox's defense. After the meeting, members of the committee said that Colonel Knox had absolutely and firmly denied the news that the Navy had fired on German warships. It was heard that Knox told the committee that the depth charge incident occurred some time ago. Subsequently, when asked about his defense report to the Naval Committee, he declined to comment. A congressman told the United Press that Colonel Knox told the committee that the patrol warship was reportedly a destroyer. When it heard a submarine approaching, the destroyer was rescuing survivors of a British ship that had been sunk in the Atlantic. The vibration stopped a few minutes after the depth charge was released. It was heard that Colonel Knox assured the committee that the effect of the depth charge did not extend beyond a 100-foot circle. It was heard that the submarine was within 100 feet of the American patrol ship. The incident was heard to have occurred at dusk. The destroyer feared that the submarine would launch a torpedo, so it released a depth charge as a warning. It was heard that Colonel Knox told the committee that US warships did not deliberately open fire on German submarines, but he declined to discuss the new instructions regarding maintaining the Atlantic sea lanes.</p>
<p>US Can Freely Dispose of German and Italian Ships, Britain Declares to the US, Waiving Belligerent Rights</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, December 11th: The British government announced yesterday that Britain has waived its belligerent rights to the German and Italian ships detained by the United States. This was announced by the British Embassy, allowing the United States to use the 28 Italian ships and two German ships it has detained to replace the American ships that have been transferred to the UK, and to make up for some of the losses of British ships. These German and Italian ships are currently being repaired and改造 by the Maritime Commission. The British waiver of this right is the result of repeated meetings between Under Secretary of State Welles and British Ambassador Halifax. The British Embassy's announcement stated that, in view of the intended use of the German and Italian ships in the United States, the British government fully approves of the steps taken by the US government to use these ships. The British government also recognizes the assistance that Britain and its allies can obtain as a result, and has therefore waived the use of its belligerent rights over these ships.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, December 12th: The United States has confiscated 16 Axis ships in the United States that were previously detained for espionage. The confiscation order was executed by the Treasury Department under the Espionage Act of 1917. Previously, there were 28 Italian ships and two German ships under "custody" by the United States. The 16 ships confiscated this time are within these 30 ships. It is also learned that the Justice Department has approved the confiscation.</p>

Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam will come here for a few weeks and then return to Haiphong. It is also heard that Mr. Sumida, the leader of the Vietnamese Japanese Mission, is currently in Guangzhou, working on something. He will also stay here briefly when he returns to Tokyo, Vietnam, in the future.</p>
<p>Nazi Air Force Losses Estimated at 7,500 Aircraft and 18,000 Airmen</p>
<p>Reuters, London, December 12th: The Times aviation correspondent said that the activities of German aircraft in British airspace have clearly shrunk, leading to speculation about the extent to which the German army, now fighting in Eastern Europe, can maintain its air force in Western Europe. The loss of 2,375 German aircraft in the Battle of Britain was enough to make them abandon daytime attacks. Since the outbreak of the European war, it is not easy to estimate the total number of German aircraft lost. However, the number lost in and around the British Isles, as officially announced, is 3,699, and the number of pilots is 9,000. It is said that the German Air Force destroyed 1,000 aircraft in the French campaign, which is probably an underestimate. The British Navy shot down 328 aircraft, and 426 aircraft were shot down over Germany and occupied areas. The Axis aircraft lost 1,969 aircraft in the Middle East, of which German aircraft accounted for a quarter. In addition, several aircraft with Vichy markings were shot down in Syria, 38 were destroyed at sea, and 56 were destroyed in the Norwegian sky. It has been verified that Britain alone has destroyed more than 6,000 German aircraft, with an estimated loss of 15,000 pilots. The number of aircraft destroyed by the Allied forces in other battles is difficult to estimate with much basis, but from a conservative estimate, it should be 1,500 aircraft. Therefore, the total number of German aircraft lost should be at least 7,500, not including accidents during training and take-off and landing, and damage in air combat. The number of pilots lost should be 18,750. Germany's preparation for war must focus on manufacturing aircraft and training aviation personnel, so it must have a large number of aircraft and aviation personnel. After occupying many countries, the production capacity of these two items must increase. However, the people of the occupied countries are mostly hostile, so aircraft must be stationed to prevent incidents. The 7,000 or 8,000 aircraft lost by Germany may have been replenished with newly manufactured aircraft, which is also possible. However, the British Air Force has been attacking German industry and transportation for more than a year, and judging from the information obtained, the losses on the ground are very significant. Even if the factories manufacturing aircraft are not greatly damaged and can produce in large quantities, it is futile to have aircraft without pilots. Aviation personnel cannot be trained hastily. Moreover, once Germany enters winter, it is often unable to fly due to weather conditions. Since Germany began preparing to attack the Soviet Union, the number of aircraft in southwestern Europe has decreased. Although Germany boasts that it is capable of handling two-front warfare, the number of German bombers and fighters transferred to Eastern Europe by the British Air Force is not small. Furthermore, some of the German pilots captured in recent night battles are young men who have just completed training, and many of the German fighter pilots who resisted British aircraft in daytime attacks in the past few weeks are also young men. Their skills cannot be compared with those of experienced British pilots, so Goering was forced to调回 some of the more experienced pilots from Eastern Europe. However, a British Air Force squadron leader recently said that the opponents we encountered were not top-notch, or even inferior, but simply rookies. Therefore, Germany's lack of aviation talent is a serious problem, and the war between Germany and the Soviet Union will make it even more scarce. Although the exact figures are not yet known, there is clear evidence that the German army has lost a large number of aircraft and airmen in the offensive.</p>
<h3>Commodity Prices in Occupied Areas Have Not Fluctuated Much in the Past Six Months, Due to Increased Production and Stable Purchasing Power of Legal Tender</h3>
<p>Chongqing Economic News: According to statistics from economic research institutions, commodity prices in various categories, except for food, have not fluctuated significantly in the past six months. Taking yarn prices as an example, the highest price per piece has never exceeded the 5,000 yuan mark. Some commodity prices have been able to maintain a balance. The reasons are nothing more than the following points: (1) Factories in the interior have resumed work, and newly established factories have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, greatly increasing production. Some light industrial products can now be self-sufficient, such as matches, soap, and leather, which can fully supply the consumer market in the rear. (2) The price management policy is becoming more and more detailed, and has gradually expanded from partial management to full management, and some partial management methods have also taken effect. (3) Commodity prices in the rear have reached the highest point achievable under the current environment. No matter where goods are transported from within, there are thick profits to be made. In addition, the government encourages the transportation of goods within, and strengthens transportation capacity. The government provides various conveniences for the transportation of certain goods, such as gasoline, cotton yarn, and steel, and the transportation of goods within has increased compared to before, and the reserves are becoming more abundant. (4) The international situation is favorable to China, and China has been in an active position in various battlefields, and is closer to the final victory, and people's hearts are stable. With these four reasons, general commodity prices can naturally tend to be stable. As for the prices of some goods that still inevitably have slight fluctuations, it should be due to the stimulation of food prices. If food prices can be reasonably resolved, then all commodity prices can tend to be stable. In addition, the purchasing power of legal tender has not changed in the past six months. The exchange rate of legal tender against foreign currencies is extremely stable. During this period, the British exchange rate has always been around three and a half pence, the US exchange rate has been between 5.5 yuan and 6 yuan, and the Hong Kong exchange rate has been around 22-23 yuan.

<h3>China to Become a First-Class Power After the End of World War, Lattimore Praises China as One of the Powers, Heroic Fighting Has Prepared the Necessary Conditions, Continental Daily Evaluates That Powers Should Be Revalued After the War</h3>
<p>Lattimore, political advisor to Chairman Chiang, made a statement while passing through Honolulu on his way to Chongqing, praising China for joining the ranks of the world's great powers, proving that China's international status has increased. In the eyes of just people in the world, China can fight bravely and resolutely resist aggression, and the work it has undertaken is the same as that of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The English-language Continental Daily in this port commented on Lattimore's remarks yesterday, considering them to be insightful. The translation of the article is as follows:</p>
<p>Revaluing the Status of Powers: Lattimore, the newly appointed political advisor to Chairman Chiang, who is currently on his way to Chongqing, declared in Honolulu on Sunday that "the result of China's four years of fighting against Japanese aggression is that China has become a major world power." In the past four years, major events that have shocked the world have occurred one after another, and the status of various powers must be re-evaluated.</p>
<p>How Can a Power Be Constituted? Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, it was generally believed that the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the Soviet Union were world powers. There are several factors to estimate the constitution of a power, such as manpower, armament, industrial organization, natural wealth, national wealth, and any other factors that make the country strong. However, judging from the results of World War II, the factors that people estimate the strength of various countries are not entirely appropriate.</p>
<p>Currently, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and Germany Should Be the Main Ones: At present, there are four important powers, because they dominate world affairs, they should all be included in the ranks of powers, namely the United States, Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union. Although the strength of these four countries is not absolutely equal, they are still huge countries among all the countries in the world. It is a reasonable conclusion to say that these four countries hold great power in their hands to determine current international issues.</p>
<p>Current Status of France, Italy, and Japan: The performance of France, Italy, and Japan in this world war has naturally raised the question of whether they should be regarded as powers at all. Under the current circumstances, at most, France, Italy, and Japan can only be included in the second-class powers, and of course they cannot be compared with the aforementioned four powers.</p>
<p>Everything Changes After the End of the War: Speaking of China's armed conflict, its achievements are far beyond the reach of France and Italy, and it has made Japan unable to escape from the stalemate. Therefore, it is a very fair argument to say that China is also qualified to be included in the second-class powers. When this war finally comes to an end, the ranks of the powers will need to be re-evaluated. Undoubtedly, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union have an advantage, and they can defeat Germany, at least temporarily removing it from the ranks of the first-class powers. It then becomes questionable whether any other Axis powers can maintain the title of "power."</p>
<p>China Will Become a First-Class Power: China has the opportunity to rise to the status of a great power and be on par with the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. China's defeat of Japan, internal unity, utilization of vast natural resources, and development of industry will inevitably enable it to rise to a position of great influence in world affairs. One thing that should not be forgotten is that China's friendly relations with other first-class powers, namely the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, will not only not hinder the improvement of China's status, but will also promote it. Lattimore's indication that China is a major world power is the truth.</p>
<h3>British Tram and Bus Companies to Simultaneously Raise Fares Tomorrow: Citizens Will Walk Instead to Save Money; French Bus Company's Driving Time Limits Are Too Harsh</h3>
<p>The British-owned Shanghai Public Omnibus Company and the British-owned Shanghai Tramways Company, citing their business revenues being unable to offset expenses, submitted a request to the Public Works Department (工部局) and were approved to simultaneously raise fares starting tomorrow. Shanghai citizen groups had previously appealed for the implementation to be avoided, but to no avail.</p>
<h3>British Tram Company Fare Increase Notice</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department-approved British Shanghai Tramways Company of the Public Settlement, has raised prices before not long ago. Recently, with the increase in living subsidies for employees and the increase in expenditures, shareholders' profits have decreased. They had planned to raise prices, but due to public opinion, they announced a postponement. Now, in view of the Public Omnibus Company announcing a fare increase starting the 14th, they are also catching up quickly, requesting the Public Works Department to approve it, so that it can be implemented at the same time. The Public Works Department also approved it. Therefore, the company issued a notice yesterday saying, "The revised fares will be implemented starting July 14, 1941. All new prices will be posted inside the company's vehicles. This is the notice from General Manager Ewen."</p>
<h3>Company's Reasons for Price Increase</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tramways Company increased tram fares. First-class average per mile increased from 6.37 fen to 9.11 fen. Third-class average per mile increased from 4.87 fen to 7.29 fen. The reasons cited were the continued decline in exchange rates and the impact of the foreign war situation, which led to a sharp increase in various operating expenses, reducing the company's investment profit. Therefore, they requested approval to increase fares, which was approved by the Public Works Department meeting on June 11. The reasons for the China Public Omnibus Company's further increase in fares were that since the revision of ticket prices in December of last year, various commodity prices have risen sharply, coupled with the issuance of subsidies to employees, resulting in a sharp increase in expenditures, making it difficult to cope. Therefore, they requested approval to increase fares. The Public Works Department's Public Utilities Committee conducted a detailed study and approved an average increase in fares of 65.54 percent within a maximum range of 1.5 jiao per mile, effective from July 14.</p>
<h3>Walking is the Best Policy</h3>
<p>The British-owned China Public Omnibus Company's price increase (an average increase of 60 percent) is the largest increase in the company's history. Citizens from all walks of life had previously organized groups to oppose the increase in public transportation fares, which would increase the burden on citizens. Now that it has been resolutely implemented, a special appeal is made to all sectors to implement "walking instead of riding" with a spirit of perseverance and hard work, so that the company's price increase will be counterproductive, achieving the purpose of sanctions, and reducing the threat to life. Moreover, the spirit of perseverance and hard work can promote a healthy body and habits, changing the decadent life.</p>
<h3>The Drawbacks of the One-Minute-One-Stop System</h3>
<p>The French bus company's one-minute-one-stop system implemented by the company authorities causes drivers and ticket sellers to not open the door at each stop, or to start the bus before all passengers have gotten on and off, resulting in constant falling and injury incidents. Citizens are especially appealing to the company authorities to prioritize passenger safety, abolish the current system, so that vehicles are not restricted by time limits, and drivers and ticket sellers no longer neglect their duties, so that passengers' lives are not treated as child's play.</p>
<h3>French Bus Company Also Plans to Raise Prices</h3>
<p>After the British Settlement tram and bus companies announced a fare increase starting on the 14th, the French bus and tram companies have also requested the French Concession Public Works Department to review the price increase. However, the bureau has not yet discussed the request and will submit it for discussion at the board meeting.</p>
<h3>Machinery Loaded on the "Guangdong" Ship Not Yet Unloaded Yesterday</h3>
<p>The British Taikoo Company's "Guangdong" ship, which set sail from the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession on the 10th, was detained by the Japanese military when it passed through the Wusongkou. Although the company authorities repeatedly negotiated, they were not successful. According to the Japanese Navy, the ship would only be allowed to proceed after the machinery shipped by Anli Foreign Company was unloaded ashore. Because this cargo had already gone through customs procedures, the request was not approved. As of last night, it had still not been able to leave the port. According to reporters' inquiries with Anli Foreign Company, the machinery loaded on the ship had not been unloaded. The entire case has now been transferred by the shipping company authorities to the British Consulate General in Shanghai, and British Consul General George will take diplomatic action to resolve it. According to Western newspapers, this machinery is a textile machine owned by Anli Foreign Company and is planned to be shipped to the Dutch East Indies. However, the Japanese military authorities insist that the machinery is being shipped to the Chinese rear and can be confiscated. Furthermore, it is said that the machinery was not inspected before being loaded onto the ship, so the Japanese side detained the "Guangdong" ship. The Japanese authorities have not yet inspected this machinery due to rain.</p>

<h3>Nash Takes on Important Position in New York</h3>
<p>Nash, the former acting deputy director of the Public Works Department, resigned and went to the United States several months ago.

<h3>Polish Embassy in This City Commemorates the Late President Yesterday: Sorrowful Wind and Rain Recall the Great Deeds of the Deceased; Plain Carriages and White Horses, People from All Walks of Life Attended the Funeral Procession</h3>
<p>After the former President of the Polish Republic and world-renowned pianist, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, passed away in New York on the 30th of last month, Polish people all over the world and people from friendly countries, either out of respect for his great achievements in founding the country or out of admiration for his musical accomplishments, mourned in unison, whether they knew him or not. Therefore, the Polish Embassy in this city held a memorial mass at 9:00 AM yesterday at the St. Theresa Church at No. 36 Dazhujiao Street. Although it was a sorrowful wind and rain yesterday morning, the participants were very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Solemnly Respectful: Church Decoration Grand and Solemn</h3>
<p>Paderewski's portrait was hung in the center, lifelike, making people solemnly respectful. Soon, mournful music played softly, and the ceremony began. Prayers and hymns expressed grief. Then, a sermon was given, and those present listened attentively, the air tense. After more than an hour, the meeting was dismissed in the melodious music. It is estimated that several hundred Chinese and Western people attended the memorial service yesterday. Important figures from the diplomatic community in this city were also invited to attend.</p>
<h3>Participating Figures</h3>

<h3>Chargé d'Affaires Presided</h3>
<p>Yesterday's proceedings were hosted by Mr. and Mrs. Rosset and other senior embassy officials. Paderewski dedicated himself to the Polish independence movement after the First World War. After the great success, he represented Poland and signed the Treaty of Versailles, assuming the position of Polish Prime Minister. Several years later, he withdrew from politics and returned to his hometown in Switzerland. When Poland was invaded, he made a comeback, serving as President of the Polish Republic. In early 1941, he left Europe for the United States and died of illness in New York on June 30 of this year.</p>
<h3>Appeal for Two Disaster-Stricken Children to Continue Their Education Receives Enthusiastic Assistance: People from All Walks of Life Sympathize Greatly and Contribute Funds; More Than Fifty Female Students Save Money to Help; This Newspaper's Colleagues Prepare to Establish the "Shen Bao Scholarship Fund"</h3>
<p>Since this newspaper revealed yesterday that two disaster-stricken children were admitted to Lida School as poor students with free tuition, but lacked accommodation and food expenses, and appealed to society, it has received enthusiastic sympathy and support from kind-hearted people. Yesterday, people from all walks of life inquired by letter or telephone one after another, and donations of 340 yuan have been received. This newspaper's colleagues are extremely grateful and excited, and are even more encouraged to fulfill their long-cherished wish to serve others. We sincerely want to be more cautious and strive to contribute our modest efforts to society. The following is a record of the situation of the kind assistance from enthusiastic ladies to Ni Zhaoqi and Bao Jiazeng for accommodation, food, and book expenses, a visit by this newspaper's reporter to Ni Sheng to see his actual living conditions, and the significance of the preparation by this newspaper's colleagues to establish the "Shen Bao Scholarship Fund".</p>
<h3>Mr. Wang Juerong Takes the Lead in Advocating</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Wang Juerong, a reader of this newspaper, was the first to be moved by the appeal of the two students reported in this newspaper yesterday. He generously donated his manuscript fee of 14 yuan for photography for this newspaper last month, and added 86 yuan, for a total of 100 yuan. He also wishes to donate 100 yuan per semester until Ni graduates from high school. Mr. Wang studies medicine at Aurora University and graduated this summer. It is especially admirable that a young man who has just embarked on the road to society has such enthusiasm for serving society.</p>
<h3>Female Students Save Money and Collect 100 Yuan</h3>
<p>In addition, yesterday we received donations from Mr. Hu Minshi of 100 yuan, Lide Hall of 100 yuan, Mr. Chen Junxin of Xin Feng Woolen Store of 20 yuan, Mr. Pu Qiting of 10 yuan, and Mr. Du Bingquan of Sino-American Xiang Embroidery Shop of 10 yuan. Yesterday evening, a lady called this newspaper and said that more than fifty female students were willing to save money during their studies and collect 100 yuan to fulfill the two students' desire to study. In total, 340 yuan has been received yesterday. This newspaper plans to wait until the current expenses needed by the two students have been covered, and hopes that the two students can further encourage their hard work and study, and repay the society a hundred times over in the future when they graduate and dedicate themselves to society. This is what this newspaper's colleagues want to encourage the two students and tell the society.</p>
<h3>This Newspaper's Reporter Visits the Disaster-Stricken Children's Home</h3>
<p>After this newspaper received letters from two primary school students from the Shanghai Disaster Relief and Education Center appealing to all sectors for assistance, a reporter was specially sent to the school for the sake of clarifying the facts. Director Chang Youju informed the reporter of the organization of the school, saying that the school accommodates 240 to 250 disaster-stricken children, mostly boys. All expenses depend on donations from all sectors. The first graduating class of primary school this semester has ten students. Except for three who are unwilling to continue their studies and are introduced to jobs by the school, the other seven have all been admitted to various middle schools. Director Chang mentioned the achievements of Ni Zhaoqi and Bao Jiazeng, who are excellent in both character and academics, and showed the reporter their exam papers over the years, which were all at the top of the list. Then, she introduced the two students to meet the reporter. Bao Jiazeng was out for some reason, and Director Chang provided written proof of the two students' achievements. After a while, Ni Zhaoqi entered, greeted the reporter with a bow, and smiled politely. After the reporter asked about his family situation, age, and hometown, he replied that his parents were still alive, and he had two older sisters and one younger brother, but his father had been unemployed for a long time, and life was difficult. The reporter then asked, "If you will be entering society in the future, what will you do?" He replied, "I deeply wish to save money on food and clothing and benefit the general poor." Director Hua said that the two students are usually very rich in national concepts and nationalistic ideas. If enthusiastic people in society provide assistance, they will remember the source when they grow up and will definitely make some contributions to repay society's gift. Another disaster-stricken child in the school, Wu Gengsheng, is from Dachang and has also been admitted to Lida School. He requested assistance from this newspaper with sincere and touching words, no less than Ni and Bao. This newspaper will consider the situation and make overall plans to assist all of them equally.</p>
<h3>This Newspaper's Colleagues Prepare to Establish the "Shen Bao Scholarship Fund"</h3>
<p>Since the war, compatriots have been displaced and their livelihoods have become increasingly difficult. Students, who are the central force of future society, often drop out of school midway due to economic reasons at this difficult time, or have no strength to enter school and pawn things to cope. It is important to know that today's students who are determined to study diligently are the pillars of future recovery and society. Colleagues have long wanted to do their best to repay the society for the kindness they have received from society, and they have all come from schools. Even when the standard of living was lower in the past, colleagues often used the family's only financial resources for their studies. Today, they are able to serve society, so how can they bear not to make an effort to appeal for the children who are diligent in their studies but lack financial resources? Therefore, colleagues decided to concentrate their efforts to prepare for the establishment of the "Shen Bao Scholarship Fund", which will handle loan scholarships for primary and secondary schools and scholarships for universities. However, colleagues have limited ability and hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will supervise and guide, and donate enthusiastically, so that the talent of society can be used to achieve success. This is what colleagues sincerely pray for and are willing to earnestly request from society for today's ambitious students who are powerless and without support. All the measures of the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund will be announced again after they are finalized, so that they can be corrected by society. If all sectors have brilliant ideas, please do not hesitate to teach them, which will not only be the fortune of this newspaper's colleagues, but also the blessing of society.</p>
<h3>US Assessor Hermelink Suddenly Leaves Shanghai and Returns to the US: No One Has Been Assigned to Replace Mr. Hermelink's Position; Legal Professionals in the United States Find This Very Strange</h3>
<p>US Assessor in China, Hermelink, suddenly boarded the President Pias ship on the 11th and left for San Francisco in the United States. However, the President Pias ship was unable to leave the port due to rain and is still berthed in the Huangpu River. Mr. Hermelink's departure from Shanghai was not announced in advance, nor was anyone assigned to temporarily replace him during his absence, resulting in no one to preside over the US Consulate Court.</p>
<h3>Mr. Hermelink Claims</h3>
<p>Before his departure, Mr. Hermelink did not specify how long he would be away from Shanghai, only saying "I will go and come back quickly." This reporter wanted to contact Mr. Hermelink yesterday morning, but was unsuccessful, because after all the passengers boarded the President Pias ship last night, the passenger ferries stopped running, and the telephone lines were also cut off.</p>
<h3>Small Civil and Criminal Cases Will Be Handled by Mr. Lu Deng</h3>
<p>Small civil and criminal cases at the US Consulate Court will be handled by Mr. Lu Deng, a clerk. However, cases exceeding a certain limit cannot be tried by Mr. Lu Deng and must be left to be tried after Mr. Hermelink returns to Shanghai. When Mr. Hermelink returned to the country for vacation in 1938, he assigned someone to temporarily replace him. This time, the same procedure was not taken, and legal professionals in Shanghai find this very strange.</p>

<h3>Truck Driver Teases a Woman, Actually Kills Her: Neglect of Duty and Fleeing the Scene out of Fear of Punishment; Handed Over to the Authorities and Sentenced to Four Years and Ten Months</h3>
<p>Liu Hanming, a truck driver from Yangzhou working for a Japanese company at No. 615 North Sichuan Road, Hongkou, was driving truck number 23382 at 3:50 PM on the 28th of last month, near the intersection of Huade Road and Weituoma Road. At that time, a sixteen-year-old woman, Yan Zhaodi, was riding a bicycle, with a boy on the back. They were coming face to face. Unexpectedly, Liu had bad intentions and teased her, and drove the truck head-on. The male workers on the truck also clapped their hands and shouted. Yan saw that it was unreasonable and avoided to the side of the road. Liu disregarded the danger and persisted, and his speed did not decrease, causing a disaster, knocking Yan down, crushing and killing her. Liu then drove away. After being informed, the patrol police sent detectives to investigate and transported the body to the mortuary for examination, ordering the collection after the cause of death was determined. Later, Liu was brought to the patrol police by his employer, and was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Patrol Police Lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted him for negligent homicide in accordance with Article 276, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, and stated the case, saying that the defendant had only been driving for three months, lacked sufficient experience, had excessive speed, and teased women, which caused the disaster. After the incident, he fled without a trace, which is inexcusable and should be severely punished. When questioned, the defendant's testimony was ambiguous. Judge Zhong sentenced Liu Hanming to four years and ten months in prison as a warning.</p>
<h3>Special Martial Law in North Railway Station: Freight Car Catches Fire</h3>
<p>At around 2:00 PM yesterday, a freight car parked near the overpass of the North Railway Station suddenly caught fire. For a time, smoke filled the area. It is said that the cause of the fire was that the car was loaded with nitric acid, which was caused by the carelessness of the workers. As a result, a freight car was destroyed. At the same time, a passenger train arrived in Shanghai, so soldiers such as the Constitution, Navy and Marine Corps, and other sentries, were sent out to protect the areas around the North Station, such as Baoshan Road, Qiujiang Road, and Xinmin Road, cutting off traffic, and the situation was very tense. Martial law was not lifted until after 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Airplane Crashes into the Sea at the Mouth of the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>It is rumored that at around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, during a heavy rain, a white-gray single-wing airplane flew from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River over the sea at the mouth of the Yangtze River. The machinery suddenly broke, and smoke came out of the tail, unable to fly high, and immediately crashed into the sea and sank.</p>
<h3>Second Batch of Foreign Rice Arrives One After Another</h3>
<p>According to news from the shipping industry yesterday, another batch of the Public Works Department's second phase of foreign rice arrived in this city yesterday. The "Jiangsu" ship carried 22,000 bags, and the "Jinan" ship also carried an estimated 8,000 bags, and it is understood that it will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. The Taikoo Company's "Suzhou" ship is also carrying a large batch of the Public Works Department's foreign rice and may arrive tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Two Cars on Park Road Robbed by Bandits</h3>
<p>On Park Road in the Public Concession, at around 11:00 PM last night, two black-plated cars, one numbered 2682 and the other 969, were suddenly intercepted and robbed by several armed bandits, and their whereabouts are unknown. They have not been found as of this morning.</p>
<h3>Impact on Factories</h3>
<p>According to a survey by the financial institutions of this city, last month, there were a total of eighteen factories in this city that changed and reorganized, and ten that closed down. However, eight of them closed down due to natural disasters and were not affected by the economic downturn. As for larger factories, such as cotton textile factories, there have been no changes. However, due to the lack of raw materials and insufficient electricity supply, coupled with inconvenient transportation, sales have not been greatly expanded, so most have reduced shifts and stopped work, restricting production to maintain the status quo. However, since the outbreak of war between Germany and the Soviet Union, the source of German pigments has been cut off, and the market price of pigments has been manipulated by hoarding, soaring. Therefore, it is permissible for the dye weaving industry to be the most affected. Currently, the number of factories that have started work has decreased by three-quarters.</p>
<h3>Heavy Rain Yesterday Morning: Roads Flooded</h3>
<p>This city experienced heavy rain again yesterday morning, starting at 0:00 AM, which was extremely heavy. By 9:00 AM, the raindrops began to thin out. During this period, the total rainfall was recorded by the Xujiahui Observatory as 39.5 millimeters, which was extremely rare. The heavy rain caused waterlogging on the roads, including Zhejiang Road, Nanjing Road, Guangxi Road, Yinghua Street, Guizhou Road, Gansu Road, Alabashito Road, Wenjianshi Road, Foch Road, Saboshai Road, Albé Road, Xujiahui, Shiliupu, Zhabei, and Nanshi, where the water was several inches deep in shallow places and several feet deep in deep places, which caused great trouble for pedestrians, especially on Shengmuyuan Road.</p>
<h3>French Patrol Police Promote Meritorious Officers</h3>
<p>The French Concession Police Department promotes and rewards meritorious officers every year during the French Democracy Memorial Day. This year's Memorial Day commends the outstanding achievements of the detectives of the Criminal Division in maintaining local security. Therefore, yesterday noon, an order was issued to promote them and increase their salaries. Detective Qin Youyu was promoted to Deputy Inspector, Deputy Detective Ma Yizhi was promoted to Detective, and Detectives Zhong Benchang, Wu Wengang, and Xu Jinlong were promoted to Deputy Detectives. Inspector Xie Guangming was also promoted to a first-class salary to show his reward.</p>
<h3>Spring Shen Temporary Relief Soup Kitchen Notice</h3>
<p>The Chunshen Relief Soup Kitchen at the Huoshen Temple in Nanshi of this city has been operating for half a year since its opening. However, the soup kitchen has always been a temporary relief measure and was originally planned to close at the end of the month. It is heard that most soup kitchens have been closed. At the Chunshen Soup Kitchen, the number of people seeking food is increasing day by day. At this time of scarcity before the new harvest, there is no livelihood. Every morning, there are five to six thousand women, children, and elderly people eating porridge at the factory. It is said that they rely on this one meal a day to prolong their lives. At the moment, the board of directors has requested the human duty of mutual assistance and will continue for another three months, from July 1st, to take porridge home to eat in order to emphasize hygiene, and to take summer medicine to benefit the poor and sick. However, donations have become exhausted, and the Jisheng Association has advanced too much money, and it is difficult to continue.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Nursery Sketch by Hui</h3>
<p>In the Huxi district, where factories stand tall, there is an organization that has been operating for only four months but has already gained the trust of people in the community. It is dedicated to the well-being of the children of workers, namely the Shanghai Nursery run by the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA). The Shanghai Nursery is located within Tongren Hospital on Bailinan Road, where the air is fresh. It currently houses thirty children aged one to four.</p>
<p>The nature of the Shanghai Nursery is entirely to serve the working class with poor family circumstances. Amidst rising prices and crowded living conditions, it is the workers who suffer the most from the pressures of life and are in the most urgent need of assistance. This can be strongly proven by the following two facts: Firstly, among the children applying for admission, the majority are eliminated after a physical examination by a doctor due to lung diseases or contagious skin diseases. Secondly, it is absolutely difficult to find healthy and lively children who pass the physical examination. Most of them are thin and weak, with weak resistance, standing on the edge of illness, unable to withstand any kind of disease. Therefore, during the prevalence of measles and whooping cough this spring, in order to avoid the widespread spread of these diseases among the children in the nursery, they had to be vaccinated early for prevention. This widespread phenomenon of being neither sick nor healthy is mainly because the income of the working class does not allow for adequate nutrition for children; at the same time, mothers working outside cannot provide children with reasonable care. Therefore, the Shanghai Nursery came into being in response to the urgent needs of the working class.</p>
<p>The food expenses (three meals and snacks) for each of the thirty children in the nursery average around thirty yuan per month. Their clothes, shoes, socks, and all other supplies are provided by the nursery. Therefore, the monthly expenditure of the nursery, including rent and staff salaries, totals around two thousand yuan. Until now, this cost has been entirely raised through donations. However, in order to make parents feel responsible for their own children, they also consider the parents' financial situation and encourage them to voluntarily contribute a few yuan per month in foster care fees according to their own economic capacity. But this is entirely voluntary, because every month someone comes to ask that someone at home is sick and cannot afford the money, and some people ask that their grandmother passed away last month and they owe debts, and the foster care fees cannot be paid for several months. In this situation, the organizers naturally do not want to force them. Currently, some of the children are adopted by people who are dedicated to social service. The method of adopting a child is to donate twenty yuan per month. For those who adopt a certain child for more than three years, the YWCA will make a porcelain plaque with the name of the adopter and hang it on the bed of the adopted child as a memento. Among these photos, one is a group photo of five lively and lovely children. These five children are adopted by a lady who is enthusiastic about social work. The last time the writer saw them, they were all sallow and thin, cowering when they saw people. But when I went to see them again more than two months later, they had become lively and lovely children who smiled at people.</p>
<p>All the equipment and supplies in the nursery are carefully selected and prepared under the necessary conditions for cultivating healthy children. The children's food is also striving to be nutritious. The organizer's intention is to try their best to run this nursery in a scientific way, but also in a popular way. Because these children will leave the nursery and return to their own homes after the age of four. If children's living habits are developed in a way that is too isolated from general social life, then these children will inevitably encounter many difficulties in terms of future life adaptation. Now, parents can visit the nursery twice every two weeks to avoid the separation caused by time and space between parents and children.</p>
<p>In short, the Shanghai Nursery has already achieved remarkable results under the joint efforts of one director, one caregiver, four nannies, and other staff. This type of emerging social enterprise requires the joint assistance and encouragement of people in the community in terms of spirit and material resources. I personally feel that we should exert our efforts and contribute money to help it grow, and strive to promote this nursery movement to benefit the next generation of citizens. (There will be copperplate illustrations published tomorrow)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Children's Library Held a Grand Opening Ceremony Yesterday. The Interior Layout is Orderly, and the Children are Actively Reading. Director Hu and Librarian Lin Announced Their Future Missions.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Library held its opening ceremony at 2:00 PM yesterday at the library site at No. 13 Dahua Commercial Building on Jing'an Temple Road. Approximately one thousand people, including Chen Qingshi, Huang Jingwan, Pu Qiting, Xiao Zhoukaixian, Chen Zhengfan, Ding Bingnan, guests from all walks of life, and children, attended. Chairman Hu Zuyin and Librarian Lin Chongzhi, among others, extended warm greetings. The Children's News Daily published a special issue. Prominent figures in the city, such as Xu Xiaochu and Zhang Ru, sent plaques. Hongyu Pharmacy donated two thousand book clips to express their warm congratulations. The library has a collection of more than 10,000 books. In addition to categorizing them according to the nature of the books, they are also divided into three levels according to the educational level of the children: high, medium, and low. They are also arranged in color to facilitate children's free selection. Yesterday, all the children who visited had a book in hand and lingered, reluctant to leave. It is also stipulated that it will be open from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM every day (except Tuesdays), welcoming all children to visit and read freely. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>A glimpse of the interior display: Stepping into the library, one is greeted by books and small desks all around. The innocent children are all actively reading, and with clear catalogs, all kinds of books can be flipped through at will. Portraits of famous people from ancient and modern times are hung high on both walls, such as Confucius, Yue Fei, Sun Yat-sen, and inventors Newton, Edison, Lincoln, and others, with profound implications, deeply imprinting on the minds of ordinary children. There are also portraits of Chen Heqin, who donated a large sum of money, and Zhou Mu, Chen Tai, which are also hung high in order to show respect.</p>
<p>A conversation with Director Hu: Director Hu Zuyin told reporters, "I am very grateful for the presence and guidance of people from all walks of life at the opening of this library. However, I am deeply sorry for the small address and the inadequate reception. The mission of this library in the future is to establish 30 circulation stations in various districts of the city. For homeless children in the streets and alleys, we plan to use mobile library vehicles to serve children of all countries in Shanghai within the possible range. We are now collecting nearly 10,000 children's reading materials, and we also plan to establish a children's reading material editing and review committee to notify children not to read bad reading materials and to edit excellent reading materials suitable for children's psychology. The procedures for reading and borrowing have been ordered in a borrowing rule and plan reading lectures, and will introduce new information to promote them. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the ladies who have supported this library in the past in terms of material and spirit."</p>
<p>A conversation with Librarian Lin: Librarian Lin Chongzhi expressed several of his opinions to reporters, which are excerpted as follows: (1) The establishment of the Shanghai Children's Library has set a new record in China's library industry. Although it has a rough scale, there is still a lot of work to be done in the future, and it depends on the full support of all sectors of society. (2) Compared with the many children in Shanghai, the library building is really too small. If the economy permits in the future, we must build a great library building to equip it completely and meet the needs of the society. (3) Examining the existing children's books, they are all published before the war, and I feel that there is a need for improvement and supplementation. The library plans to organize a children's reading special editing committee and jointly publish good special features suitable for children's needs with the publishing industry to make further contributions. (4) The library will be officially open for reading from today and will also begin to handle applications for borrowing cards and contact matters for the establishment of circulation stations. The lending date should be around August 10.</p>
<p>Children send letters of thanks: Shanghai children Ying Chun Gao, Ying Chun Tong, and other children appealed to all sectors of society last year to establish the Shanghai Children's Library. Now that the goal has been achieved, they sent a letter to the association yesterday to express their gratitude. The words are as follows: "Dear Sir/Madam, Chun Gao, etc., appealed last year to establish the Shanghai Children's Library. We have learned that your association has worked hard to prepare and finally realized the construction of the Children's Library, bringing rich and healthy spiritual food to supply us, creating great happiness for us children, which is really very grateful to us. Now, on behalf of the children of Shanghai, I would like to express my warm gratitude to your association and wish you all good health and happiness."</p>
<p>Issuance of Commemorative Awards: The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Children's Library has now completed the matter of awarding donors. Jinqi was presented to Xu Xiaochu, Hu Guigeng, and Chen Zhusheng, with the text "Cultivating Talents." Plaques were given to Xiao Zhoukaixian, Ding Jianxing, and the Women's Middle School of the Public Works Department, with the text "Enlightening Outstanding People." Various commemorative medals were given to other donors. Photography was also held to commemorate. Awards were also given to other team leaders and fundraisers to express their gratitude. Chen Zhengfan, the secretary-general of the preparatory committee, presided over the preparatory work on a voluntary basis until its completion. In addition to raising 3,275.38 yuan, he also donated 554.35 yuan of charity funds. The Standing Committee decided to express its sincere gratitude and present a silver vase with the text "Benefiting Children" to commemorate it permanently.</p>
<p>Private Yangzhong Moved to Shanghai to Resume Classes</p>
<p>Private Yangzhong in Yangzhou has been established for nearly 20 years, and more than 2,000 students have graduated from junior and senior high schools. In the winter of the 26th year of the Republic of China, Yangcheng fell, and the school moved to Fanchuan, which belonged to Taixian County, to resume classes. Later, it moved from Fan to Gaoyou, Donglizhuang, and finally to Zhenwu Temple in Jiangdu. Although it was repeatedly affected by the war, it moved again and again, but it never stopped classes. Now, because the above-mentioned places have become war zones as a whole, it has recently moved to Shanghai to resume classes. It is now using the old site of Shengyangzhong Building on Xinzhi Market Building, Jing'an Temple, in the British Concession as a school building, and has improved the board of directors and properly settled the fund. In addition to the registration of old students, the new arrivals are very enthusiastic.</p>

<h3>Finance: Japanese Merchants Prevent the United States from Freezing Funds and Vigorously Dump American Exchange.</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed exchanges did not fluctuate, and the black market for British and American exchanges showed a counter-trend reversal. After the opening in the morning, Chinese speculative traders engaged in selling and part-time operations. Japanese merchants' banks continued to vigorously sell, reportedly to prevent the United States from freezing funds. Hong Kong Electric sold less British exchange, and HSBC re-issued US dollars. Gold prices fell again to within 6,600 yuan, and speculators were more eager to sell, so it went straight to the close, with British gold at 3 pence 21875 and US dollars at 5.28125, all showing a rebound. There was a very active transaction today.</p>
<p>HSBC Hong Kong Electric All Sell</p>
<p>Since the morning, the foreign telegraphic exchange market in the US and India has fallen, and the US market has not changed. The exchange rates of various countries have not changed. The bank's selling price opened early in the domestic market. The spot British gold was 3 pence 203125, and the US dollar was 5.25. Speculators were divided on the US dollar at 5.25, and the market situation was slightly unstable. It can be settled at the above price, and then it softened to be sold. HSBC's listing has not changed, and the silver balancing tax is 1.5 points lower, accounting for 23.00%. Japanese merchant banks sold US dollars at 5.25 in July and August, and HSBC also sold at the same price. Moreover, Hong Kong Electric came to sell British gold to Hua Bank in July at 3 pence 21875, which immediately hardened to be difficult to sell. Therefore, Chinese merchants actually competed with Japanese banks to sell US dollars at 5.28125 in August. At noon, it became even harder to buy British gold at 3 pence 21875 and US dollars at 5.28125, which was 0.015625 higher for British and 0.0625 higher for US dollars than the closing price on the previous day.</p>
<p>Hong Kong American Exchange Slightly Higher Hong Kong, December 12 (Saturday) Telegraph: The exchange market opened flat this morning. The spot price of American exchange was 0.0625 higher, at 24.4375 yuan. The spot price of Shanghai exchange was 3 yuan lower, at 465 yuan. There were no other changes.

<p>Tianjin British Flat American Loose Tianjin, December 12 (Saturday) Telegraph: The exchange market opened loose this morning.

<h3>Panic Rises on the Gold Market as Short Covering and Speculation Occur Simultaneously, with Settlement Only Cinching One Yuan as the American Exchange Rate Settles.</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was extremely difficult to predict. Even experienced operators found it tricky, rising first and then falling, with the price retreating into the 6,600 yuan range. The morale of all parties changed from stable to uncertain. It was heard that Japan was preventing the United States from freezing funds, and Japanese merchant banks repeatedly sold large amounts of foreign exchange, causing the foreign exchange rate to suddenly become loose. Panic rose, and companies like Xinfeng, Yongyi, Yuande, Fuyi, and Daqun rushed to get out of their holdings. Chida and Hesheng added more force to sell. Therefore, after the opening in the morning, Jin Hao Chengji and Dafeng bought in, rising to 6,647 yuan. Later, following the loosening of the foreign exchange rate, it sharply dropped to 6,591 yuan. It was still because tomorrow (Monday) afternoon, from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM, was the spot swap (from July to August). It was heard that the seller would pay the buyer around 40 yuan. Therefore, those who covered shorts were also eager to do so, and the price continued to fall by 30 yuan, not as sharply as the loosening of the American exchange rate, resulting in the settlement price only being cinched by one yuan. The total transaction volume in half a day was 50,000 taels. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. Cash was sold by Mingfeng to Xianghe for 30 taels, at a price 290 yuan higher than the spot price, also a small 30 yuan, and decorated gold was 5 yuan lower, totaling 710 yuan.</p>
<p>Retreating into the 6,600 Yuan Mark: Since the opening at 9:15 AM this morning, the price per bar (10 taels) was 6,628 yuan, which was 5 yuan higher than the closing price on the previous day. It was decided to be 6,625 yuan. It was heard that the American exchange rate of 5.25 was difficult to sell, and the market situation was boosted. Yi Dada, Dafeng, and Chengji competed to buy in, and the price immediately rose by 22 yuan to 6,647 yuan. Xinfeng, Yongyi, and Yuan sold strongly, and Chengji also re-issued, hovering slightly around 6,640 yuan. At 10:20 AM, the loosening momentum of the foreign exchange rate gradually increased. The number of sellers in the market gathered more and more. Defu, Hesheng, Yi Dada, and Chida sold fiercely, and scattered shorts rose up to short sell. Around the 6,600 yuan mark, the price fluctuated slightly as Hedaifeng, Tongkangyong, and the silver number gang collected and absorbed. It was heard that the near-term American dollar at 5.28125 could also be settled, and the price retreated to 6,591 yuan. The midday closing price was 6,593 yuan, which was 30 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. The settlement price for the July American dollar at 5.28125 was 6,594 yuan, a difference of one yuan. After the closing, Chengji sold small amounts to 6,590 yuan, and Xinfeng Yongjin rose to 6,595 yuan. There was a difference of 56 yuan in the first half of the day. There was no market on Saturday afternoon. The selling price of cash number's gold was 300 yuan higher than the spot price, and the buying price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for the current bidding gold.</p>
<p>Silver Building Decorated Gold Hangs a Small 5 Yuan: The exchange price of silver building jewelry gold per tael was initially 715 yuan by Da Tonghang and Xin Tonghang, and it was lowered by 5 yuan at 11:45 AM, totaling 710 yuan, and the buying price was reduced by 40 yuan.</p>
<p>American Dollar Has Outflow When High: Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: The spot price rose first and then fell. The prices of British and American gold pounds also fell by one yuan. The price of British gold notes remained unchanged, and the market price stood flat. The price of American dollar notes opened at 18 yuan and 94 cents. After the opening, Zhenhe, Xinghe, Shuntai, Yongzhi, Chengda, Dachang, and others competed to buy, raising it to 19 yuan and 6 cents. Liji, Chengfeng, Dagong, Lianhe, and others sold off when the price was high. The closing price retreated to 18 yuan and 89 cents, which was a decrease of 14 cents compared to the previous day. The trend of Hong Kong notes was stable, and the market price stood flat. The Japanese gold note slightly tended to weaken, and the evening market retreated to 2 yuan and 2 cents. The trend of Korean notes was stable, and the market price stood flat. The evening market still stood at the original price of 1 yuan and 61 cents. Grain: Rice prices rise, but actual sales return to silence.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign rice rose first and then fell, and the market shape showed a circling phenomenon. After the market opened this morning, following the previous day's price increase, speculative traders continued to hoard it for balloon trading. The market price immediately followed the activities of the top palace and gradually increased. The return of Yinghua Company's current and forward goods was the most speculative and lively transaction, and the price immediately increased by more than 2 yuan. No. 2 Siamese was from 145 yuan and 7 cents to 146 yuan in July, and Xiaojiao was to 154 yuan and a half in July, and the current price was 153 yuan and a half. However, actual sales were silent after the price increase, and those who made profits also took the opportunity to sell at a high price. The current price of rice was slightly higher because of the supply of Hong Kong rice on this street, and the inner mainland of the customer gang was blocked due to rain and had no intention of handling it smoothly. In addition, the rumors on the market were proven to be untrue, and the market price immediately fell back in a vigorous selling atmosphere. No. 2 Siamese also decreased to 145 yuan and a half, and Xiaojiao is now at 151 yuan and a half, with a period of 153 yuan and 57 cents. Yinghua Company was also only 800 to 900 tons, and the result was only about one yuan higher than the previous day, and the spot price was only half a yuan in and out, with less than 7,000 bags traded. It is estimated that the closing price of No. 1 Saigon high-quality goods was 132 yuan, 131 yuan, 130 yuan and 5 cents in the middle, and 129 yuan, No. 2 was 1234 yuan, Xiaobao was 118 yuan, special Siamese was 134 yuan, No. 2 Siamese was 124 yuan, the middle was 122 yuan, Mindang was 134 yuan and a half, the middle was 130 yuan, Hefomi was 128 yuan, Xiaowen was 125 yuan and a half, 125 yuan and a half, 125 yuan, and the middle was 123 yuan, and broken tip was 97 yuan to 95 yuan.</p>
<p>The market for thick, thin, japonica rice, national rice, and glutinous rice is generally normal. All depend on the scarcity of goods in the market and the even supply and demand, so the market is not changing. The original plate is guarded. It is estimated that the opening of Nanhang fresh early and late rice is 142 yuan to 140 yuan, Wuxi original packaged white japonica rice is 1356 yuan, old japonica rice is 1323 yuan, Hong Kong Baiyuan high is from 125 yuan, secondary to 121 yuan, Nuolu is 1145 yuan, and Jindan Guoyuan is 127 yuan to 125 yuan.</p>
<p>The sales of powder on this street are slightly moving. The current foreign powder is firm in the morning and loose at noon, and the transaction is very clear. Because of the weekend period, there are fewer customers hoarding in and out. Except for the slight movement of actual sales on this street, there are very few large transactions. Only more than 2,000 bags of Jinlong powder were opened, and the initial opening was 33 yuan and 15 cents, and then it was immediately loosened to 33 yuan. 500 bags of Turret powder was also opened at 33 yuan and 67 cents. There are also 500 bags of Australian powder from Hong Kong under the Bodhi brand that have been opened, and the price is 33 yuan. The quality of this product is said to be good, and the customer gang has the intention to handle it. Other brands are not open on the market. The market situation is loose, and there is no market for wheat.</p>
<p>Oil Cake: Cooking Oil Rises One to Two Yuan</p>
<p>Soybean Cake Sleeve Empty and There are Exports</p>
<p>Cooking Oil: The source is lacking ships in recent days.</p>
<p>The goods are not selling smoothly, which makes the owners quite determined to sell, and the market is rising again. Yesterday, 50 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were sold, 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 70 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 30 barrels of Hankou soybean oil, and more than 1,000 dan of clear oil from this factory. The price was one or two yuan higher than the previous day (price details in the market price column (Soybean Cake: Yesterday, the price was turned up together due to the fact that the empty households had quite a few offsets, and a group of powerful people planned to engage in cash settlement. It is estimated that 1,000 pieces of Dayou soybean cake were sold, and more than 10,000 pieces of Xingshi soybean cake were sold on the spot, and more than 30,000 pieces of futures were sold. The market rebounded by about half a yuan.</p>
<p>Today, 2,500 pieces of soybeans will be shipped to Hong Kong, 250 pieces to Little Luzon, 1,880 pieces to Singapore, 2,000 pieces of soybean cake to Singapore, and 2,060 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Yarn Flower, Cotton Yarn Faces Bearish Pressure, Credit for Each Month Turns Downstream Again</h3>
<p>The yarn market has entered a period of fluctuation again. This is due to the unusually active short-selling, creating heavy pressure. At the same time, purchases by the Guangdong merchants are sluggish, not as prosperous as in the past. As a result, confidence is weak and the market is soft. However, those with sufficient capital will come in to buy when prices fall. Therefore, both the bulls and the bears are fighting fiercely. 20-count Double Horse yarn had a high price of $1,573 and a low price of $1,557. In the afternoon, due to the end of the week, there was a lack of transactions and no deals were heard.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning and continued the momentum from the afternoon of the previous day. The opening price was $1,558, then fell to $1,556. Subsequently, due to profit-taking, the market rebounded to $1,560. This price held for a while. Afterwards, it was heard that although the spot yarn trade in Guangdong was clear, spot yarn prices remained unchanged, and confidence rose to $1,573. However, the market at a certain exchange was not good, selling voices rose again, and the trend turned downwards to $1,558. The closing price rebounded slightly to $1,564. It is found that the trading volume in half a day was 4,600 bales. On the 13th, 2,195 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount of yarn bought by each region is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 100, Peers: 4,500, Total: 4,600</p>
<p>Golden Transformation Horse Futures Yarn. The market sentiment was good at the beginning of the morning, because it had fallen sharply the day before, and off-market merchants bought slightly, and short sellers also covered their positions. July and August rose by $3 to $4.5 each. There were many buyers in September, rising by $14 alone. After the opening, it continued to rise slightly. Later, as the international situation was not optimistic and exchange rates and gold prices remained weak, the bulls started to sell again, and prices went downstream again. The closing prices for each month in the afternoon were down $6 to $8 compared to the previous day. A total of 12,180 bales were traded in half a day, a decrease of 10,020 bales compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, the market was closed due to Saturday. The opening, closing, high, and low prices for half a day are recorded on the left (net market prices).</p>
<h3>Cotton Merchants Unwilling to Sell Cheaply, Trade Quiet</h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation is that the yarn market is weak, and the momentum is tired, but holders are unwilling to sell because their inventories are not thick and the supply is not smooth. If prices fall, they are unwilling to sell. Therefore, the market is relatively quiet, with a temporary standstill. On the 13th, 150 pieces of cotton were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>New York Cotton Market: The market is quiet and firm, due to industry buying and unfavorable weather reports for short sellers. Yesterday's closing price was up 7-8 points from the previous day.</p>
<p>Indian Cotton Market: First, it rose due to active short-covering, then fell back due to long profit-taking. Finally, the market rose again due to mass buying and cotton merchant covering. As a result, closing prices were up 4-9 rupees each. Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trading: The market is quiet and firm, as trading is slightly lower due to slightly suppressed buying intentions from all parties. Yesterday, in addition to factory orders for more than 700 pieces of Brazilian cotton, there were no transactions for grade cotton.</p>
<p>Securities: Government Bonds Rise and Fall Easily, Let's See the Bullish Front</p>
<p>Over-the-counter Government Bonds: Yesterday's market continued to strengthen. Xiehe and Yuanjin's appetite remained strong, causing the bond market to rise again. Class C broke through the $2 mark, while Class A remained weak and listless. The rise was not widespread, indicating that it failed to arouse the interest of the general public in going long. Only Class C showed abnormal development, which also shows that both bulls and bears gathered here, so rising and falling easily is not difficult. The trend still needs to look at whether the new front of this round of bulls is consolidated, or whether it still wants to transfer risk. Yesterday, only one session was done in the morning on Saturday. Class C saw $2 at the opening, and once broke through the mark in the middle, but still closed outside $2. At the beginning, Xiehe and Yuanfu had a large appetite, about 500,000, supplied by Lianhe and Tongshun. Dazhong bought 300,000, spit out by Hongda and Yitai. Others such as Xie Kang, Tong Kang, Xinfu, Yichang, and Dahuasheng all bought in. The sellers were Xie Da, Hefeng, Lianyi, and Runde. The recent trend has been that old longs are selling and new longs are buying. This kind of evolution, near the dividend payment, does not seem to have a flustered situation for the bulls. As a result, it continued to rise by 2 to 5 cents, with a transaction volume of around 200,000 yuan. A simple table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 100 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity Company were traded at a price of $9.</p>
<p>Piece Goods: Both Cotton Cloth Imports and Exports Are Rare</p>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market was quiet. Stockholders and peers thought about trading. Both imports and exports were rare. Users with real needs occasionally inquired, but most also adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Sales of coarse cloth and coarse twill stood firm. The fall in fine cloth and fine twill was also suppressed. A part continued to fall by a small amount of 2.5 cents. This street traded more than 200 pieces of spot and future cloth. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants traded nearly 300 pieces of coarse and fine twill and figured cloth. Nanyang merchants traded 5,000 to 6,000 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth.</p>
<h3>My Views on the Method of Exchanging Money Shop Notes</h3>
<p>— Jack</p>
<p>The exchange of notes between members of the money shops has always adopted the method of reconciling public notes, which is very crude compared to the method adopted by the note exchange of the banking industry. There is no shortage of enlightened people in the money industry who advocate for reforms. This year, in order to easily check for numerical errors and calculate the balance of each account on the settlement day, the money shop reserve adopted the "Note Exchange Public Note Report Form" and implemented it on June 2.</p>
<p>The "Note Exchange Public Note Report Form" is 15.5 inches long and 8.5 inches wide. The name of the form is arranged horizontally in three lines. The first line is "Shanghai Money Shop Joint Reserve," the second line is "Member Shop," and the third line is "Note Exchange Public Note Report Form," followed by the date. The table lists the names of each member shop, and the order of arrangement is: Dade, Dalai, Yuansheng, Wufeng, Renchang, Ankang, Anyu, Cunde, Tongrun, Tongyu, Junchang, Jintai, Huichang, Chengyu, Yida, Hefeng, Xinfu, Xinyu, Chunyuan, Yida, Zhixiang, Zhentai, Shunkang, Yichang, Fukang, Fuyuan, Gengyu, Jukang, Zifeng, Qingda, Qingcheng, Dingkang, Zhengxiang, Hengjiu, Hengtong, Hongsheng, Baofeng, Jinyuan, Fuli, Shende, Yihe, Xinzhong, Xinhe, Yonglong, Qichang, Baochang, Tailai, Dunyu, Zikang, Jianchang, Money Shop Reserve. To the right of the shop name is the "Received National Currency" column, and to the left is the "Paid National Currency" column. On the right side of the table are three "Notes": "(1) For the convenience of checking, from now on, each shop only needs to fill in the number of public notes received and paid on the same day in this form and send it to the reserve. The public notes received on the same day can be kept in this shop for verification; (2) Please fill in the numbers in this form clearly; (3) The method of receiving and paying in this form is based on the shop filling in the form." On the left side of the table is "This table is sent to the Shanghai Money Shop Joint Reserve for reference," followed by the place for the member shop to stamp. At present, the exchange of notes is divided into two types: head division and remittance division. Therefore, below the member shop's stamp, the words "head division" or "remittance division" are printed in red. At the bottom of the table, in the line of the Money Shop Reserve, the words "Today's Reconciliation Receipt" are printed in red on the left, and "Today's Reconciliation Payment" are printed on the right, which are used to fill in the difference between receipts and payments. The last line is the total. If the total numbers on both the receipt and payment sides are equal, it means that the calculation is correct.</p>
<p>The "Note Exchange Public Note Report Form" is roughly similar to the "Exchange Difference Calculation Form" of the Note Exchange. Therefore, the adoption of this form is a major step towards a scientific exchange method in terms of the money shop's note exchange method. However, there are still differences in complexity between the two in content: First, the exchange difference calculation form also has a "Number" column and a "Number of Sheets" column for both debit and credit sides; Second, the exchange difference calculation form has four more lines below the total. The first line is "The Exchange Difference to be settled in the Exchange," the second line is "The Total Amount of the First Exchange," the third line is "The Total Amount of the Second Exchange," and the fourth line is "The Total Amount of the Daily Settlement to be Settled." But in terms of method, the current exchange method of the money shop reserve is largely the same as that of the Note Exchange.</p>
<p>The money shop has always been rich in conservative color. Therefore, after this reform, some member shops believed that the procedures were cumbersome and requested improvements. The Money Shop Association convened a meeting of representatives of each member shop on June 17 to study the matter. The opinions raised by each shop included four types: (1) It was advocated that the Note Exchange Public Note Report Form should still be used, and the shops should reconcile the numbers and submit them to the money reserve; (2) Stipulate the time for receiving notes, restore the public note system and improve it; (3) Adopt the exchange method of the Note Exchange; (4) Extend the exchange time by half an hour, mutually reconcile, and each shop issue one public note. The Jinyuan Shop also proposed a draft reform plan for public notes: (1) Organize a committee to determine the note exchange time and increase the number of exchanges; (2) The public note should be renamed the Interbank Reconciliation Accounting Sheet and exchange methods, etc. As a result of this decision meeting, a "Public Note Problem Research Committee" was organized, and nine members were elected, including seven from each shop and two from the money reserve. The first decision meeting was held on June 24, and the second decision meeting is scheduled to be held on July 10. It is not yet known whether the money shop's note exchange method will be restored to the original method, continue to use the current method, or adopt the Note Exchange method. For the sake of protecting the money shop, the author is willing to offer his humble opinion. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Eastern Piece Goods: The market trend is stable. Spot cloth transactions are few. Leading Longtou stock closed at $47.95, up 3.5 cents. Medium-grade fine cloth and twill were flat. Four Gentlemen Serge closed at $1.585, up 2.5 cents per yard.</p>
<p>Exports: On the 13th, 1,070 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong, 85 pieces to Singapore, and 175 pieces to Little Luzon. Yesterday, the sugar market trend rebounded slightly. The association's market quotation was: 24 Coarse White Outer Wharf New Goods, $95.8; Old Goods, $93.9. Delivery on the 20th of this month, $96.1 to $96. Taikoo Cart White B Mark, $115.5 to $118. Due to Tianjin merchants searching for goods, the rise was very strong. DY Mark was priced at $104; HX Mark New Goods, $94; Dutch Red, $74.</p>
<p>Seafood: Fennel Stale and Soft</p>
<p>Recently, due to the thick stock of fennel and the very stale sales, the price has been softening. Since entering the $300 mark, there have been few buyers. Now customers' bids are harsh, differing from the market price by more than $20, resulting in few transactions.</p>
<p>Coal: Heling Coal Dust Arrives New, 6,500 Tons</p>
<p>Heling coal dust has been arriving in large quantities recently. It is heard that a certain foreign firm has shipped 6,500 tons of new goods. Although the sales market is sluggish, the cost has not been reduced due to high exchange rates. Therefore, the market will still maintain $220. However, the over-the-counter market has begun to fall due to stockholders selling out, reducing about 10 yuan. Factories on this street have slightly bought in on the cheap, it is said.</p>

<h3>Make Friends with Nature</h3>
<p>— Yang Lingxiao</p>
<p>Little friends, in the subject of nature, it should be the most interesting of all your homework! Because it will tell you the origins of wind, clouds, rain, and snow in the sky, and various natural phenomena. It will tell you about the occurrence and changes of various strange animals and plants on the ground. It will also tell you about treasures such as gold and silver in the stratum, and the principles of electric cars, automobiles, and other things that move. And sometimes it will tell you some interesting scientific tricks.</p>
<p>But among you, there are many children who not only do not feel interested in this subject, but even have a feeling of disgust. What is the reason for this? The reason is that they have taken the wrong path of research. They memorize unfamiliar terms and dull texts without thinking about them, memorize them rigidly, read them to death, making them dizzy and exhausting their brains, but in the end, they still don't understand the reasons for them. What's the use of this?</p>
<p>Little friends, the subject of nature requires a research mentality. There is no need to read it to death. As long as you observe frequently, every plant and tree in nature, even a piece of mud and a piece of stone, is a living textbook for studying nature. The key is to use your brain to think very carefully, and then use your own hands to do it. Think and do, do and think, then your interest will naturally increase, and the principles it talks about will naturally be understood. For this subject, we must not be impatient or hasty. We must observe and test patiently. If we don't understand, look again and look again. If we fail, don't be discouraged. Think again and try again. If we continue in this way, we will eventually understand it. Look at the inventors in the world, which one did not succeed after one or two times, or even tens, hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of times of testing?</p>
<p>In short, studying nature requires not being afraid of difficulties, not reading textbooks to death, but combining hands and brains, pursuing the truth from doing, and having the determination to try again and again. If you do this day after day, then the nature that you were initially unhappy to make friends with will unconsciously become a good friend of yours.</p>
<h3>Young Drummer</h3>
<p>— Liyi</p>
<p>Napoleon, who dominated the world, fought against the famous Austrian general Melas when he attacked Austria. Unfortunately, he was defeated in the place of Malego! His famous general Desa led the defeated army and temporarily stationed in front of a hill. Napoleon stood on the hill and saw that his army was defeated beyond recognition, so he said to the young drummer beside him, "Beat the retreat drum!"</p>
<p>This young drummer had participated in many battles. He was so brave, although he was very young. When he heard this, he picked up the drumsticks and walked to Napoleon and said, "General, I don't know how to beat the retreat drum. I only know how to beat the charge drum. I beat the drum to make the soldiers rush forward one after another, bravely and fearlessly. I beat such drums next to the pyramids, on Mount Tabor, and under the Rodi Bridge. Should I beat such drums here again?"</p>
<p>Napoleon was very moved, so he said to Desa, "We have been defeated. What should we do?" Desa immediately replied, "What should we do? Let's defeat them! Drummer! Beat the charge drum!"</p>
<p>So the defeated army turned around and advanced. Desa unfortunately died in the first row of gunfire. Napoleon's army fought bravely and finally won the victory. This is the famous victory of Malego in history. When later generations talked about the battle of Malego, they praised Napoleon's martial prowess without end. Who knew that this was entirely due to the strength of the young drummer?</p>
<p>Little friends! What are your thoughts after reading the above?</p>
<h3>Third Brother's Repeating a Grade</h3>
<p>— Xintian</p>
<p>A letter came from Sanbei School. In addition to a report card and a payment slip, there was also a small piece of paper. At that time, I thought it must be something like a tuition fee increase, but when I opened it, I was shocked. It said: "...The student of your house, ××, failed the exam this semester. According to the regulations of the Ministry of Education, he will continue to study in the original grade next semester. I hope you will observe..." Third brother was standing next to me, concentrating on the report card. Suddenly he noticed my surprised look and quickly shifted his gaze. I was afraid that he would be greatly stimulated if he saw it, so I folded it up casually; but unfortunately, the key point had already been known to him. Immediately, he reached out and took the paper and then wept.</p>
<p>The hearts of all children are very fragile. When they are so sad that they cannot restrain themselves, they can only use crying to vent. I knew that comfort was useless, so let him vent for a while. But when I turned my head and saw the shame on Third Brother's face, I couldn't help but think of how he usually studied. Indeed, Third Brother is the most fond of reading in the family. He usually doesn't play much. I remember a few days before the exam, he even stayed up all night reading. At that time, my father said that his grades must be better than ours. Who knew that after the results were announced, he would encounter such misfortune.</p>
<p>Because of this, I became suspicious about the matter of Third Brother repeating a grade. So I opened my mouth and asked him, "Third Brother, don't cry. I have something to tell you. Didn't you prepare very well for this exam beforehand? How could you fail?" Third Brother wiped away his tears and looked at me as if asking for help. "I am really too timid; on the day of the exam, I was very scared, and because I didn't sleep well, I was very dizzy. I didn't know how to answer the questions on the exam paper. It seemed like I had forgotten everything I had read at that time. I thought and thought, but I couldn't think of anything, and time was running out. In a hurry, I had to hand in the paper randomly. As a result..." As he said that, tears welled up again. Listening to his reasons, I knew the reason why he repeated a grade. So I advised him, "Third Brother, I understand. The fundamental reason for you repeating a grade is actually because you misunderstood the meaning of 'studying'. You thought that studying was nothing more than for the sake of exams, as long as you got a lot of marks. You got a upgrade and study will be achieved. In fact, it is not that simple at all. If you want points, just promote grade, and during the exam, there are many people who cheat a lot. So grades are by no means important things, and seeking knowledge is the most important job. When you go to school, just try to acquire practical knowledge, and don't worry about anything else. Exams are just a tool to measure how much knowledge you have. Can you connect these points to find the shortest route to catch a rabbit? Also, a diligent person will definitely be able to pass, so don't take exams too seriously and be afraid. If you relax a little, your courage will naturally increase; if you don't drive a car day and night, the dizziness and brain swelling will certainly not happen. This time of repeating a grade is the driving force for you to change. If you can resolve to change your attitude towards studying from now on, and do it according to what I said, then this time of repeating a grade is by no means a shameful thing for you." After speaking, I looked at him solemnly. In that short glance, I seemed to feel that I had gained valuable gains.</p>
<h3>Why is it Easy to Have a Headache in Crowded Places?</h3>
<p>— Baili</p>
<p>Ming'er and his father went to the theater to watch a movie. After returning home, Ming'er just kept saying that he had a headache. His father said, "It must be watching the movie that made your head hurt."</p>
<p>"Can watching a movie also cause a headache?" Ming'er asked in surprise.</p>
<p>"Yes, because there are too many people in the movie theater, and the air doesn't circulate very well. It's easy to get a headache. If you are alone in a small room and don't let the air circulate, then you will soon get a headache. This is because there is dirty air in the room. In this crowded movie theater, the air is of course even dirtier," his father said, taking a sip of tea and continuing, "This dirty air is the useless and harmful waste that is excreted from our bodies. No matter how clean a person is, they will have this kind of excretion. But we also need to know what kind of excretion can make the air dirty. As a result, we know that it is the excretion from the skin, especially the excretion from unclean skin, which is more likely to make the air dirty. After we breathe in this dirty air, it can make the blood vessels in our brain circulate poorly, so we get a headache." After his father explained this, Ming'er understood.</p>
<h3>The Fan's Autobiography</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xixian</p>
<p>I am a beautiful small fan. My master is still young, so I call him young master.</p>
<p>The young master treats me very well. He carefully puts me in a specially made box. Now the weather is very hot, the young master takes me out of the box, puts me next to him, and takes me to school. The young master praises my flexibility and beauty. The other children look at me and admire me, I am extremely happy. Now, let me describe my past history:</p>
<p>I was a fan in the window of a certain company for a long time. One day, a mother and son paid a high price to buy me. The staff in the company immediately handed me over to him. He loves me very much, so I have been living a happy life until now.</p>
<p>Questions After the Rain Lin Ren</p>
<p>The weather in summer really changes. When it is happy, it blows the dark clouds away and lets the hot sun shine on the ground. When it is unhappy, it summons wind and clouds and pours down heavy rain, but the rain will not last too long. In a while, it will be sunny again after the rain.</p>
<p>When it rained, it caused a lot of questions in Aliang's mind, turning around in his brain. One afternoon, when it was raining heavily, he asked his father, who was writing:</p>
<p>"Dad! Why does the rain fall in drops? Is there any rain that falls in pieces?"</p>
<p>His father smiled when he heard this question, wondering how he could come up with such a question, but he didn't feel disgusted. On the contrary, he felt that his son was willing to use his brain and could think of such a meaningful question. He was very happy in his heart. He thought for a while and said to him with a smile:</p>
<p>"Before answering your question, do you know how there is rain?"</p>
<p>"I know. Mr. Zhang, who teaches nature, told us: When the water in the river is heated by the sun, the water turns into water vapor and rises to the sky. But the higher the sky, the colder the temperature. When the water vapor hits the cold, it condenses and turns into raindrops and falls down. But he only talked about Daoli, but didn't tell us why the rain falls in drops?" Aliang answered like reciting a book.</p>
<p>"Have you ever thought about it? When water vapor hits the cold, how does it condense into raindrops? This is because there are countless dust particles in the sky, and raindrops are water vapor condensed on a particle of dust, so of course it becomes one drop after another. Even if the rain initially falls in chunks, the air has friction, and when the rain block falls, it must pass through the air and be subjected to the friction of the air, and it will still have to divide the rain block into one drop after another. Let me give you an example to make it clear: Doesn't the water sprayed out by the fountain go straight up in a straight line? But when the water is sprayed to a high place and falls down, the water will no longer form a straight line, but becomes one drop after another."</p>
<p>"Dad, where does so much rain that falls today flow to?" Aliang asked about something else.</p>
<p>"The rainwater that falls flows into the ditch, and the water in the ditches all over Shanghai follows the ditches to the ocean; some of it falls into the soil, and there are many roots of trees, flowers and plants in the soil. The roots have the ability to absorb water, and they absorb the water into the tree body and leaves, so that the tree will not die of drought: some of the water flows into the small river; and some of the water is immediately dried into water vapor by the sun when it falls on the ground. Therefore, only half of the total rainfall flows into the ocean."</p>
<p>"So is there a place in the world where it never rains?" Aliang asked another question.</p>
<p>"There is no place in the world where it doesn't rain. Even in the desert, which is considered the driest place, there are sometimes strong winds and heavy rains. Like the Sahara Desert in Africa, it doesn't not rain at all, but there are very few opportunities for rain, even only once every few years. People there value water as much as we value gold."</p>
<p>Aliang listened with great interest. When he finished speaking, he picked up the pen and wrote again, and he was embarrassed to interrupt his father's writing again.</p>

<h3>Chaplin's Quirks</h3>
<p>— Cheng Wei</p>
<p>Since ancient times, geniuses have invariably possessed eccentric personalities, and Charlie Chaplin is naturally no exception. Moreover, he is exceptionally quirky. Now, let me tell you all:</p>
<p>Fond of Sports – A lover of solitude, he often goes for walks alone. When the mood strikes, he'll walk fifteen miles, then call his chauffeur to pick him up. Sometimes, on the way home, he would abandon the car and walk, letting the chauffeur drive back first. He considers golf a game for idiots because chasing after a ball after hitting it seems a bit ridiculous. At seventeen, as an amateur, he participated in the British 26-mile marathon and surprisingly came in second. He loves swimming and baseball, but dismisses football as one of the games for fools. He is very skilled at playing poker, but only plays for half an hour at most. He has never been fond of gambling, but he always speculates in the stock market with decisions of thousands of dollars or more.</p>
<p>Morbid Gluttony – He is very casual about what he eats. Plain boiled beef tripe and mutton suit his palate best. He is obsessed with curry, the spicier the better. Sometimes he can go without eating for twenty-four hours, and the next day he will eat four or five meals in a row. He is most afraid of getting sick, but often, because the dishes suit his palate, he adds four or five servings in one go, resulting in another bout of illness. He never went to school, but he has a collection of three thousand books, which he consults and studies on his own. He enjoys reading the Bible the most, but he does not believe in any religion. He often suddenly thinks of going to church and runs to the church without a second thought, but which denomination does the church he enters and the service he attends belong to? After he finishes and follows people out, even he himself is baffled.</p>
<p>Indifferent to Wealth – His left hand is more agile, but he can write with both hands. He doesn't write much. In the past ten years, he has written less than twelve handwritten letters. The sentences he writes are very short – about five or six words. He has never received music education, but he is proficient in all kinds of instruments. When he plays the organ at home, it is always for three or four hours. When playing the violin, he holds the bow with his left hand and presses the strings with his right hand. The arrangement of the thick and thin strings is the opposite of the usual. He is very rich, so he is very indifferent to wealth. It is rare for him to be happy to work. People in the photography studio often "just eat and do nothing for several months, with Chaplin paying their full salaries." When he is inspired and thinks of filming, he suddenly appears in the photography studio, urging people to work like a madman, almost completing ten days of work in one day, making everyone sweat profusely, and exhausting himself!</p>
<p>Singing After Bathing – His residence is very large, and only he and six male servants live inside. Women, except for his own relatives, rarely enter his home. He refuses to let others light the stove; he must do it himself. The fuel for the fireplace is large pieces of coal; firewood is not allowed. He must take four baths a day: once in the morning, once at noon, once before dinner, and once before going to bed. In the bathtub, he always raises his voice and sings, singing baritone, with tunes but no lyrics, singing everything from southern to northern tunes. In the evening, wearing a brightly colored bathrobe, he locks himself in the bedroom, locking every door himself, even the door connecting to the bathroom is firmly closed. As for the windows, they are kept open all night.</p>
<p>Carefully Reading Newspapers – Every morning after waking up, his servant delivers breakfast and two newspapers to him before he gets up. He eats and reads the newspapers, reading everything on the paper in detail. If he feels that the editorial or news is poorly written, he will get angry and scold the reporters. He has more than two dozen sets of pajamas. When getting up, he always puts his feet on the right side of the bed, stepping on a fixed spot. If the servant inadvertently puts the mink blanket in the wrong place, he will feel very unhappy all day. In short, he is an outstanding freak, and his quirks are truly endless. Due to the small space, I can only briefly write down these few points.</p>

<h3>Random Notes After Playing the Qin (1)</h3>
<p>— Hua Yu</p>
<p>I love to study the qin, but I lack teachers and friends. In my spare time, I often use books and records to explore. Over time, I have gradually gained some knowledge, so I write it down in a book. Now I record a few notes to enrich the art world and to discuss with fellow enthusiasts.</p>
<p>It is well known that the Jinghu (Beijing Opera fiddle) is divided into the Mei and Sun schools. The Sun school emphasizes strength, and its playing is heroic and unparalleled, full of courage. Therefore, its sound is clear as pearls strung together, and its momentum is lively. Wang Shaoqing inherited its skills. The Mei school's qin emphasizes softness, and its playing is characterized by steadiness and thickness, lingering and endless, with inexhaustible implications. Hu Tiefen inherited it. Beginners in qin should take the Mei school as their foundation, adopting its rules and regulations. After a little progress, they can emulate the Sun school to obtain its vigor and strength, which will be perfect!</p>
<p>The method of supporting the melody can be fully described with the four words "wrap, follow, cushion, supplement." Let me try to explain their meaning:</p>
<p>Wrap - To wrap a small number of notes with a large number of notes. For example, when the female role in Xipi opera sings the closing phrase, it is often "gong liu" (5 6 in numbered musical notation), and the Jinghu uses "gong wu liu" (5 56) to wrap it. Or if the phrase is "liu yi si" (6 7 4), then "liu si yi chi si" (6 4 7 1 4) is used to wrap it.</p>
<p>Brief News</p>
<p>(1) The students of the Venus Drama and Film Training Class Alumni Association are recently organizing the "Venus Drama and Film Monthly," which is currently being registered and will be published soon. (2) The "Chinese Harmonica Circle," published by the Chinese Harmonica Circle Publishing House, has already published its seventh-year Guoguang issue. Editor Bao Mingshan, for the sake of widespread trial reading, has specially donated a large number of copies to the Xinhua Radio Station at 470 Nanjing Road, welcoming readers of this newspaper to request them by attaching postage.</p>
<h3>Chess Garden</h3>
<p>— Edited by Lian Xuezheng of Putian</p>
<p>Game 322: Battle of the Square City, devised by Yu Dengrong, Red goes first to win</p>
<p>Solutions to Game 321 "Breaking the Wok and Sinking the Boats" are listed below (Red goes first to draw) - In the previous issue, the word "draw" was mistakenly printed as "win": Chariot 4 advances 3, General 4 advances 1, Horse 9 advances 7, General 4 advances 1, Chariot 4 retreats 2, Advisor 5 advances 6, Cannon 1 retreats 2, Advisor 6 retreats 5, Horse 1 retreats 3, Advisor 5 advances 6, Horse 3 advances 4, Advisor 6 retreats 5, Horse 4 retreats 5, Advisor 5 advances 6, Horse 5 advances 6, Advisor 6 retreats 5, Horse 6 retreats 8, Chariot 2 retreats 7, Horse 7 advances 8, General 4 moves to 5, Horse 8 retreats 7, General 5 moves to 4, Cannon 1 moves to 5, Pawn 9 advances 1, Cannon 5 retreats 6, Pawn 4 moves to 5, Horse 7 retreats 6, Pawn 9 advances 1, Horse 6 advances 5, Pawn 9 moves to 8, Horse 5 retreats 4, Pawn 8 moves to 7, Horse 4 retreats 3, Pawn 5 moves to 4, Horse 3 advances 5, Pawn 7 moves to 6, Horse 5 retreats 6 (Draw)</p>
<p>Addendum: Game 320 is in accordance with the correct method. Mr. Shi Boquan wrote to say that it seems the black side should swap the positions of the chariot on the 4th/7th road and the soldier on the 6th/7th road, otherwise the pawn advancing 4 to 3 will immediately win. This is indeed correct, and a correction is hereby made.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 12: As Helpless as Ning Wu</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I received another letter from you, scolding me for refusing to come out and kill the bandits. How sad I was in my heart, so I first sent the messenger back to report, and then, at night, I took my precious sword and dart bag, left without saying goodbye, and had to leave my aunt alone, and came to Ningwu Pass to help in the battle, to show my determination, hoping to make a small contribution. On the way to outside Daizhou City, I encountered a small team of bandits, killed several of them, and snatched a fine horse to rush here. It just so happened that I rescued Jing Ge here. Isn't this fate? But I don't know what the situation is like at Ningwu Pass? Can it still be defended?" Xu Jing said: "So you had this difficult situation, I wrongly blamed you." Then he told him about the urgent situation in the pass. After speaking for a long time, he felt even more tired and could not hold on. So, he first took off his armor and hung the Red Phoenix Precious Sword on the wall. Turning around, he saw a meditation bed on the east wall, walked over with staggering steps, and lay down. He sighed and said, "My arm hurts very much, and I am very tired. I am sleepy and just want to lie down." Liu Yining said, "Jing Ge, your injury is not light, rest for a while, that's good. There are no good medicines for wounds here, otherwise I would have applied them to you earlier. The bandit general is extremely hateful. I didn't kill him, which is too much of a bargain for him." Xu Jing said, "A tiger that has been hit by your dart will not be peaceful even if it goes back. Let him suffer some too. I only hope that General Zhou can hold on. After I rest for a while, I will go back and kill them with you to help General Zhou kill the bandits." Liu Yining said, "Very good, you close your eyes and sleep, I will protect you here. I don't think the roving bandits will kill up here." As he spoke, the old monk came with a wooden tray holding a bowl of porridge and a dish of salted vegetables, which he placed on the table, saying, "There are no tasty dishes in the temple, and there is nowhere to buy them here. Please, two generals, just eat some." Liu Yining said, "Thank you for your trouble." Then he scooped a bowl for Xu Jing and had Xu Jing sit on the couch to eat. He also scooped porridge for himself and ate. Xu Jing ate two bowls and felt full. He didn't want to eat any more. Liu Yining also ate two bowls and put them down, letting the old monk take them away. Liu Yining then told Xu Jing to sleep peacefully. Xu Jing was already tired, closed his eyes, and fell into a deep sleep. (114)</p>
