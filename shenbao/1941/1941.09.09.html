<p>社評</p>
<h3>釋麥氏之新經濟政策</h3>
<p>英國衆議院國家度支委員會主席麥爾恩最近演講新經濟政策之綱要，象徵公意所在與期望之殷，以麥氏之職位而坦白抒其公正之抱負，可知其人民之喁喁矣。麥氏首引一九二一年與一九三一年兩度經濟恐慌所貽之慘重影響與非經濟的救濟設施爲改造經濟政策之張本。蓋良好之經濟制度第一，非但對於老年或因痼疾而不能工作者以及大衆失業者應予以規定之救濟，抑且須使人人獲得永久性之工作與酬報。第一，良好制度中之幣制與金融政策必能使盡人享受國家之物資，並獲致穩定之物價。惟揆諸近二十年來之經過現實與前述目標相去甚遠，此制度之所以急待糾正者也。</p>
<p>麥氏於是暢論缺乏消費爲過去經濟制度之障碍，而現代科學之進步在在使生產方法改良與簡單化。足徵今日之問題爲消費的而非屬於生產之範圍。常聞數百萬人民飽受凍餒之痛苦，而同時巨量之食物則擲諸海中，或遭焚毀。以謀物稀爲貴而獲致厚利。對於消費之强大活力可以促進生產事業與效率者，則皆恝然置之。凡工資有所增加、則必指爲提高成本，而不知此杞人之憂，實不足爲患。縱令以幣値單位計算之成本提高無已，而同時如得有充分消費的支撑，於事何妨，不難設想。</p>
<p>此消費意義之重大、斷不容以常理測之，當可了然。若徒以救濟生活，培養不勞而獲的依賴性性，實屬現代不幸之矛盾視象。或謂此由於無工作可以支配，而爲不得已之舉措。第不知其所以然者，全由於無消費之故，如能給予工作而予以報酬，即可產生所需之消費，輾轉促成生產與工作之增加。此點初視之虛無縹渺，似是而非；苟窮究現階段經濟機構之運用，必能恍然於消費之作用猶如機械之須先加油添薪而推動其工作。再用其收入所得以淸付開始之消費支出也。嘗聞人浮於事之說，母乃事浮於人之誤，而此其由來，蓋不知應所事者何也。廢物利用，我人今已習知，世上豈有廢人可令投間置散哉！易言之，在現代之經濟機構中，人力不失爲最重要之因素，是以我人必須善用此寳貴之因素，以利導國家社會事業之建設。</p>
<p>然則消費之活力果何在乎？我人雖欲消費，如無貨幣之媒介，復無價値之標準，其將何以達此目的？此其癥結所在，有賴於幣値之善爲運用，而爲之疏通與解決。蓋今日萬物皆有其確鑿不移之尺度權衡，而幣値之標準則獨付缺如。當一九三一年麥克密倫爵士編製報吿時。即着眼於幣値之穩定，但迄無成效。且幣値之穩定，非僅限於單位之問題，而大宗資金之運用，其影響於消費之活力與幣値水準之維持，允屬重要，是以我人更須計及信用放款之問題。</p>
<p>考銀行之經營放款，向以股東利益爲前提，而此戰後之條件，則必須維持物價之水準與管制信用放款之伸縮爲嚆矢。同時復須將國際收支之淸算與國內之生產與消費截然分爲二事，互不牽涉。因以往値國際收支逆差而輸出黃金以淸償時，常將國內之信用放款緊縮，轉令生產突减或消費低落。以致發生恐慌等情。爲使實現上述之新經濟政策，允宜設一新中央銀行或將其原有之中央銀行擴充其功用，並增發信用放款之籌碼，以商業票據爲準備，包括短期之生產與銷售貨物，與長期之固定資產，以及其他可增進社會之繁榮與幸福之建設資產爲抵押品；惟所有投機交易之票據，則一律予以屛除。</p>
<p>麥氏最後大聲疾呼金錢之爲人主已久，我人必令其爲人奴而後可。是則制度問題之關鍵在於激發良心爲重，而以改造頭腦爲輕。</p>
<p>綜上各點而言，新經濟政策之醞釀由來已久，而麥氏之建議自屬順天應人之舉，且精闢獨到之處良多，行將爲制度改造之重要方案也無疑，反觀我國經濟機構，難免罅漏，是故戰後之需要調整，允爲迫切，爰爲釋義以當他山攻錯之資。</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談　（七）（八）　蘇聯的經濟防綫</h3>
<p>這篇是美國Christian　Science　Monitor的紀載，茲譯錄如次：</p>
<p>希特勒即使衝破「史丹林防綫」，蘇聯的抵抗決不因而終止。</p>
<p>蘇聯在經濟上有五個目給自足的俄羅斯，各有其天賦資源與農工業，其發展的程度，已能使本區與其他部份失去聯絡時，維持一個軍隊的生存，給養和配備。其中除兩區，即西北部原來的工業區（包括莫斯科及列寗兩處在內）及頓河流域的烏克蘭區在歐洲部份外，其餘三區，即烏拉爾區，科士尼茲流域及遠東太平洋區域，都位於亞洲方面。</p>
<p>希特勒即使佔領莫斯科，他距離歐亞兩洲交界綫的烏拉爾山脈，即蘇聯的第二道工業防錢，尙有一千哩之遙呢。</p>
<p>建設新工業區，使敵人鞭長莫及，自始即爲蘇聯經濟計劃的主要方針。蘇聯的重心逐漸東移，即以此故。蘇聯政府當局對於亞洲原無宿緣，不過因爲　略的關係，他們不得不注意到東方。</p>
<p>在蘇聯第一屆和第二屆五年計劃下，大規模工廠，如馬格尼多高爾斯克鋼鐵廠及科士尼茲五金廠等，已在烏拉爾山脈東部禿坡及西伯利亞荒凉的平原上建立起來了，每廠所出的鋼鐵，遠較工業化計劃實施前全國鋼鐵總產量爲多。</p>
<p>馬格尼多高爾斯克鋼鐵廠常初的建立計劃，原應大於格萊鋼鐵廠，結果却照預定計劃縮小一半，但仍不失爲蘇聯天字第一號鐵廠。這種偉大計劃的進行，已使當地成爲二十萬居民的繁榮市鎭。</p>
<p>一九三八年度，馬格尼多高爾斯克廠出產生鐵一百五十萬噸及純鋼一百七十萬噸，比較端典，捷克和波蘭三國戰前每年的總產量尤多。</p>
<p>烏拉爾區域還有別的鋼鐵廠以及銅廠鋁廠等，或已開工，或已在建立中。赤里雅平斯克牽引車廠，供給全國三分之二的之牽引東和戰車，也設在該區。此外還有製造飛機和各種口徑大砲和砲彈的工廠。蘇聯當局對各廠生產數量與詳情，雖嚴守秘密，但聞單單是烏拉爾區這些工廠，就能源源以各種兵器和軍需，供給他們的軍隊了。</p>
<p>烏拉爾山以東一千五百哩，是科士尼茲流域，恰當西伯利亞的腹心，是列寗理想中的東方大工業區。</p>
<p>尼茲　　　的煤，佔全國總產量五分之上，數量僅次於頓河流域。大部份煤產現在都運往烏拉爾，馬格尼多高爾斯克，下塔吉爾等地工廠。該區還貯藏豐富的鐵銅錳等金屬。大規模鋼鐵廠吶所，大規模化學工業廠一所及橡膠廠兩所，均已局部開工。</p>
<p>德軍的勃興，增加侵略的威脅性，致使蘇聯不得不加緊向東發展，但蘇聯的經濟防禦戰略，在一九三九年初間即已形成，即所謂第三屆五年計劃，其詳細內容於兩年後始行宣佈。這個戰略的主要特色，在把蘇聯工業及經濟地圖劃分爲五個自給目足的單位，各有自己的資源和農工業的製造廠，其實力與歐洲某一强國相等，或且過之。</p>
<p>新計劃着重在發展當地的燃料產量，使谷新廠設在原料產地附近，並蜴力使當地出產糧食。政府當局爲鼓拗產糧起見，特頒佈法令多種，禁止甲區域蕃薯及其他大宗食物，經由鐵路運往乙區。當局叉注意當地的氣候，委任各植物學家改良小麥，蕃薯，蔬菜的種子，以便適宜於極北地帶及乾燥區域栽植。</p>
<p>這種地方自給自足運動的緊要方針，雖謂緩和鐵路運輸的擁擠情形，（水泥，木村及其他建築材料，已列人禁運貨物單，不得由西伯利亞經由鐵路運往歐洲部份，）但其根本原因，却欲使每一自給目足區域，在戰時與其他區域失去聯絡之後，仍能繼續活動和抵抗</p>
<p>關於蘇聯在經濟上防禦侵略的計劃，莫洛托夫於一九三九年三月向共產黨第十八屆大會報吿第三次五年計劃時，已多少透露其內容，但他不欲聳動聽聞，故當時外間鮮有人注意及之。</p>
<p>惟此種計劃亦不無弱點，其主要者在於設計與實行不能一致。時間上實不許各區域平衡發展。最發展的舊工業區，都在侵略國貼鄰。當局近年來雖用禁止建立新工業的方法，以阻止莫斯科與列寗區的擴張，但並沒有减少兩地在國防經濟上的重要性。</p>
<p>烏克蘭西部頓河流域，地位尤其重要。當地的克里伏伊羅格鐵礦，每年出產鐵砂一千六白萬噸以上，佔蘇聯全部鐵砂產量百分之五十九。該區的銅鐵廠出產生鐵九百萬噸，純鋼八百五十萬噸，超過蘇聯全部鋼鐵產量半數以上。該區出產的錳，佔蘇聯全部產額三分之一。該區若吿淪陷，不啻損失蘇聯工業產量之半，並奪去他們穀產四分之</p>
<p>但蘇聯即使損失這兩區域，其他部份仍可繼續私在。以亞洲的三個工業區而論，烏拉爾是最富饒也是極度發展的一區。料士尼茲區也已有長足的進步，僅達東區尚在幼稚時期。各區產穀，自給有餘。</p>
<p>蘇聯的主要油田係在巴庫，地處頓河流域東南七百哩。巴庫及其北面的格羅齊尼油區，有險峻崎嶇的烏拉爾山脈爲其屛藩，歐洲的侵略國欲從　地進窺，比登天還難。勢惟有經由海道或土耳其進攻之一途。英軍佔領敘利亞和英蘇兩軍在伊朗取得聯絡之後，高加索油田，已無危險了。</p>
<p>蘇聯的油產業雖有十分之九出自高加加索，但第三屆五年計劃曾在世界貯油最豐富的伏爾加和烏拉爾兩區間，開闢第二個「巴庫」。截至目前爲止，該區每年的產煤油二百萬噸。據原來計劃，預定至一九四二年產油一千一百萬噸。烏拉爾河上游馬格尼多高爾斯克以南一百六十哩的奧資克，亦已有種種煉油設備，供大量提煉之用</p>
<p>烏拉爾河東面恩巴油田和伊西巴葉伏油田，每年約產油一百萬噸。西伯利亞也有　士尼茲流域及其東面的拜喀爾湖及里那河畔的油田多處。堪察加半島也產煤油。這僅隨初步勘測的結果，日後繼續測騐，還可發現別的油田。</p>
<p>蘇聯達東區域尚待發展的油田，只有里那湖濱及庫　　一帶。庫頁島產油量較戰前的波蘭略勝一籌。惜乎一半油源已租給日本了。</p>
<p>巴庫若吿陷落，蘇聯的煤油問題雖將遭遇嚴重的困難，但還有巨大的資源，足供應用，若能假以年月，這個問題，自可迎刃而解。從另一方面說，西伯利亞雙軌鐵道及拜喀湖黑龍江間即將完成的鐵道，可望解決運輸上的問題。</p>
<p>蘇聯的經濟自給目足計劃，也像別的計劃一般，因力不從心而吿敗，但其局部成就，已給以繼續抗戰的可能性。</p>
<p>希特勒若要獲得完全勝利，非殲滅全部紅軍，並制止其徵發無窮盡的人力編練新軍而後可。但蘇聯大　人民，無論男女，都　受軍事訓練，希　勒欲進行這個工作恐極困難吧</p>
<p>蘇聯民間的國防團體已指導數百萬名男女會員，使用步槍和機關槍的技術及防空方法。還有多數人民已受特別軍事訓練，如飛行，傘兵降落及游擊戰術等。所以蘇聯國防的廣大基礎，還　過正規軍呢。</p>
<p>自成吉思漢侵略俄羅斯時代起，俄國的每個國防計劃都以大塊領土將被外國侵略軍　佔領　個假定為前提。六百年來，莫斯科幾乎每隔百年必被外國軍隊侵占一次，　　人，立陶宛人，波蘭人及法國人都曾蹂躪　俄　，俄人每次都能保持一部分軍隊，而在別處　復元氣和續成　軍後，把　　逐出國　之外。</p>

<p>邇來蔬菜食物之貴、罕出其右、而爲油豆開其端、油豆之貴、大連日商及上海油商一吹一打、操縱而成、蔬菜之貴、亦有受油豆影響、如豆腐油豆腐之類、但大部分受橋頭捐卡苛征、及小販乘機抬價所致、並來源節節統制、重軍剝削之故、照現在物價、一家生活眞不易、姑以一元爲單位相計算、大致如左、</p>
<p>猪肉　四兩　靑菜　　斤四兩</p>
<p>生豆油　七兩半　馬鈴薯　一斤半</p>
<p>老豆腐　五塊　大瓜鲞　一斤</p>
<p>芋艿　兩斤　大毛豆　　斤四兩</p>
<p>金花菜　十二兩　芹菜　五把</p>
<p>小絞米　九合　煤球　六斤</p>
<p>大鴨蛋　兩只半　豆腐皮　廿張</p>
<p>照此計算、六口家庭、一日三升米、六斤煤球、四兩油、連其他小菜、大約非十元一天開支不可、還是靑菜豆腐爲大宗、實行其「三月不知肉味。」</p>
<h3>紗花　補空與斬多齊起　雙馬乃迂迴前進　期紗拉提更有力</h3>
<p>紗市　升、且漲風益熾、此因競爭市塲上逐步提升之故、以致人心活潑、於是空頭旣扒補而又翻多、如斯一來、籌碼較緊、市盤乃迂迥前進、不過實際交易並不暢旺、港幫僅辦幾十包、所以有一部份將多額紛紛了結、檯面尙硬中帶平、另有一說南洋方面、需要繼續良好、此日紗價格堅挺之所由來也、二十支雙馬高價爲一千七百四十九元、低價爲一千七百三十五元、午後開盤平平、價爲一千七百四十三元、旋聞取引所價向上、人心激昂、買者紛至沓來、絡續漲至一千七百六十一元收盤云、目前紗市、因雜牌紗基礎鞏固、多頭吸收之額、按兵勿動、今日有棉紗二十件運廈門、七百〇五件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨　、因浮空辦補活躍、氣勢轉昂、首盤價爲一千七百三十八元、逐步升至一千七百四十一元、然大戶獲利者一律吐出、又復回挫爲一千七百三十五元、取引所開盤上漲、市况帶昂、在此　千七百四十三四元之間、　　甚久、漲至一千七百四十九元、復　　戶空頭又來拋出、回鬆至一千七百叫十元、然現紗交易平庸、收盤價爲一千七百四十五元、查半日間成交統計八千〇十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<p>金雙馬期貨市況、飛黃騰達、趨勢異常挺俏、蓋以美棉　漲、人心已可憑籍向上、且取引所節節步昂、更使多方拉提之因素、是以廠單開出後、即由大戶之收購下、直趨上升、故期紗隨之煥發、亦有靑雲直上之勢、當晨初開出九月期爲一六四二元、即漲十七元、十月期爲一六六一元、軋好　　元、十一月期爲一六七五元、高上七元五角、人後波動靡定、略帶疲勢、午收近遠期的各漲七至十二元不等、午後因各幫力加搜羅、檯面買氣更盛、並以廠單與取引所續漲、益使買戶興奮、故九月期一度高至一六五〇元、十月期升達一六七三元、十一月　漲至一六九　元五角、收盤時　形回軟、結果九月期以一六四〇元收市、十月份一六七一元五角、十一月份一六九三元、各漲十五元至二十五元半、觀各市紗價脚地之堅穩、若環境上無特殊變遷、恐將續使期紗有上升之望也、茲列表於後、</p>
<h3>待外匯辦法　洋花交易停頓　印棉到一千五百件</h3>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日爲平準會實行取締黑市外滙之第一日、各友邦銀行完全停止供給一切外滙、故雖屬各方對於外棉之訂購心思仍爲熱烈、但格於無從取得美滙、只能等待以後具體辦法之公佈、銀行能否再有黑市、或直接申請標準外匯而決定去留焉、預料因事件之非常重大、若不解決、實關滬上各種商業前途、故或二三日內即將有明文規定也、棉又有到埠、怡和洋行泰生輪前日（七日）抵滬由香港運來印棉一千五百十十件、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、該項印棉係喀爾喀搭運到香港、然後由巷轉運來滬、</p>

<p>暗市如停頓狀態</p>
<p>外滙昨日市况、中央與匯豐兩掛牌均平、美銀行小櫃檯又停止還價、致英美匯暗市又陷入停頓狀態中、蓋香港平準會議之結果、本市十四家銀行除正當商業結款外、對於黑市停止購售、華商投機家無從落手、致今後之市面、將由出口商與非必需品之進口洋行互相以一執中價買賣、據某華商掮客談、大部份買賣、仍須由掮客從中斡旋而找對手、對外貿易實為物物交換矣、至昨市價始終爲英金二便士八五九三七五、美金四元八四三七五、全日未聞成交、</p>

<h3>港幫搜買現金　猛漲一百五十元</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤、期貨初少變動、終日盤於六千八百八十元左右、僅十五元高低、成交千兩左右、乃外匯黑市呆定也、現金驟然轉漲　乃香港幫忽搜羅也、交易頗旺、自晨首由祥和進永豐　十兩、爲九千〇六十元、即做高二十元、繼之父進義豐七十兩、及成記　十兩、福康永十兩、爲九千〇八十元、義豐同價售予鑫源三十兩、祥和再進合盛十兩、及祥興永四十兩、均九千〇九十元、公和萬豐各出予天元十兩、爲九千一百元、祥和再進義豐十兩、升至九千一百二十元、正午照上價有賣戶、下午鼎盛首先來售、賣小至九千一百元內、售予順源十兩、爲九千〇九十元、證券號德孚忽來傾進、漲風重熾、進順源十兩、爲九千一百元、又進義豐二百兩、及祥和五十兩、爲九千一百二十元、再進義豐十兩、又與大豐各進祥和二十兩、忽又復出予德成五十兩、價均九千一百三十元、不意德孚忽再來力進、漲風又起、淮聯興二十兩、爲九千二百元、又進祥和十兩升至九千二百十元、後祥和續來復出、立降五十元、出成記十兩爲九千一百六十元、終又出大豐十兩、九千一百九十元、軋升一百五十元、當日高低亦一百五十元、有七百餘兩成交、首飾金亦掛升十元、達九百四十元、</p>
<p>期貨毫無生氣</p>
<p>自晨十月期每條（十兩），九點十五分開市、因天元加碼售出、致開低五元、為六千八百七十五元、滙票商大豐·自源·聚豐永·公和等先後買進、升至六千八百八十五元左右、十點三十五分始至六千八百九十元、新豐永售小至六千八百八十五元、不久又趨堅穩、午收六千八百八十九元、下午有供少求、賣方自動喊低脫手、故二點開市爲六千八百七十八元、比午收價低十一元、新豐永時和來收吸、漸升至六千八百八十七元、爲德成·天元售出、當見回下、三點半收市六千八百八十元、與上週六收價仍同、照美匯所扯之結價、六千八百五十八九元、抬二十一二元、當日僅十五元高低、現金號之本牌金、門市售價九千二百五十元、收進减二百元、現標金無價無市、</p>

<h3>證券　內債進出不同　舍甲乙而就丙戊　中國紗廠股登場</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市繼續趨堅、大戶續來搜購、空戶略有抵補、行市堅定如恒、甲乙兩種略小、因各戶頗有掉貨交易、即捨甲乙收丙戊、因此略有畸形趨勢、盤旋向上實人心過好、銀根一時加緊、現已漸鬆、洋拆亦漸改小、環境上並無有與空頭有利之消息也、昨上午丙種以一元開盤、高至一元〇五分、初因怡泰澗德中孚中一等買進而高、繼以德孚同康大華聯和賣出而略回、午後恒康及信孚收丙戊出甲乙、協興元略有補進、潤德加碼、鴻大亦有買進、怡泰略有復出、四十一號出丙戊、同康出甲丙、仍以需要丙種爲最多、結果甲乙小一角半二角、丙戊好三角一角、丁種無上落、成交約一百八九十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交中華書局股五十股、價為七十二元五角、</p>
<p>衆業公所股市當活潑、開盤價較前收爲高、嗣因賣方壓力重重、價格未能續漲、但經一度軟化後、市况卒又穩定、中國紗廠股首次登塲、成交十四萬股、價格盤旋於十四元一角與五角　、</p>
<h3>糖市　囤戶糖　大為興奮</h3>
<p>昨糖市因傳黑市外滙有停止供給說、故客囤進意均濃、極爲興奮、價乃一致上騰三四五元不一、定貨有太古開出十·十一月份裝船荷粗白三千包、價爲美金四·二三五、公會割盤、現貨二四粗白八月份入口一百三十一元半、下午三十一元八角至三十四元、升四元九角、七月份一百三十一元、下午三十三元至三十三元半、升五元一角、香港貨一百廿四元、至廿六元三角升三元八角、生砂一百十三元、荷赤路貨一百十七元、廿一元、NT嘜一百二十元、升一元半、公司期貨二四粗白九月十日交割者一百二十七元七角廿五元九角·廿八元九角、下午廿九元·三十一元一角、升三元四角、二十日期一百三十元·三十二元半·三十一元四角、下午三十一元八角·三十四元、升四元八角、統共成交期貨達七萬餘包、現貨八千餘包、八日自香港運來五千三百四十六包</p>
<h3>疋頭　電力供給將再減縮　棉布囤戶再起　南運疋頭不少</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市趨勢堅昂、布價一致上騰、乃因外傳電力公司有再减縮電力供給一成之議、及其他利多消息、團戶進意濃厚、手貨乘機拉抬、結果白貨粗細布斜紋張每疋五角至七角半、漂染布漲五角至一元、本街成交各布六百餘件，粵港幫辦色布色斜二百餘件、南洋幫進漂布印花布斜紋等一百餘件、浙東溫台幫辦粗布等五六十件、今日有疋頭二十四件運廈門、四百四十二件運香港、又上週末（七日）有疋頭一千九百十件運港、七十八件運新加坡、</p>

<p>香烟市况、昨日買氣又趨緊俏、蓋廠方派銷外埠同業之貨、必先備（搬出證）以資證明、然後可享派貨之權、故各方認以後之貨、勢必趨减、人心恐慌、執貨者扳持價格、市面再圖上進、做開大英牌每箱二千三百三十元、比上日升五十元、老刀牌一千一百七十元、品海牌一千六百六十元、小仙女牌一千六百六十元、五華牌一千三百四十元、十枝大美麗中箱一千三百元、買價一致較上日反見昂悄、</p>

<h3>友邦銀行不再經營　滬外匯黑市消滅　平準會昨電令停止懸牌　　供給法定外滙辦法頒佈　出口商所得滙票限售十四家指定銀行</h3>
<p>本埠麥加利·匯豐·花旗·大通·有利·運通·通濟隆·荷蘭·安達·莫斯科國民·及沙遜三家等總計十四家友邦銀行、自於九月六日起、奉平準會命、按照新規定價格供給必需品進口外匯後、昨日又由美大使館傳到平準基金委員會之電令一律停止黑市匯率之掛牌、故素爲當局決心消除之上海外匯黑市、巳自昨晨起因各銀行之合作、突趨絕跡、此等十四家在英美荷三國凍結中日資金令統制卞之友邦銀行、決同意平準會之措施、不再直接或間接經營黑市交易、咋日各該銀行之掛牌、均爲平準會所規定之優越價格、扣除銀行應得佣金之數、計美匯五元十六分之五、即五元三一二五、國幣十八元八角二分合美金一元、英匯爲三便士一五六二五、</p>
<p>兩車政府　勸令合作</p>
<p>據銀行界權威方面稱、昨日本市各外商銀行停止黑市買賣、係英美兩國政府正式勸吿該國在遠東各銀行、與平準委員會通力合作之結果、在凍結令頒佈之初、本市執有特種執照之各外商銀行、因仍對黑市買賣外匯、致黑市投機活動、一如往昔、此决宣吿對黑市停止交易、則公開投機買賣、自可消滅、對正當進口貿易所籌之外匯、得由各指定銀行代向平準委員會申請、按照新匯率供給、對禁進口物品、因未能結得所需外匯、或陷於完全停頓、此舉對於本市貿易入超當然可以調整、</p>
<p>結滙貨品　分為兩類</p>
<p>昨晨平準會通知上海十四家持有准營外匯業務執照之銀行、謂該會將按照規定價格、以基金供給上海匯市、俾維護大量之合法進口貿易、凡能獲得此種賤價外匯之貨物、分爲兩類、甲類包括工部局訂購之食米·礦油生產品如汽油·烟葉·及燃煤等、乙類包括之貨品甚多、其中有曾列入一九三九年禁止進口物品單上者、乙類中最重要者爲棉花·苧蔴·傳電及發電之電機·他種機器·罐頭食物·麵粉·小麥·化學品·藥品·靛靑染料·白報紙·皮革·橡皮·汽車·車輪·橡皮胎·照相及電影材料及其他、按在以上甲乙兩類貨品中、礦油生產品中之汽油及烟葉·苧蔴·罐頭食物·等、依照一九三九年海關所公佈者、皆在禁止進口之列、而今平準會所以核准其進口而予以優越外匯之供給者、諒係參酌市上需要所致、至汽車·車輪·橡皮胎·照相及電影材料等等、雖不列入行政院決定之准予進口貨物名單、而今平準會將其歸入應結匯之物品內、其理亦同、</p>
<p>供給滙額　逐月限制</p>
<p>上述甲已兩類物品、平準會均准供給優越滙率之英滙或美滙、但供給數額、並非絕無限制、而採用「攤派」之辦法、平準會對任何一種准予進口之物品、規定每月結滙額數、逾額即拒絕供給、如規定每月對食米　口結滙一百萬美元、凡進口商之　給外滙者、均照此數攤派、如總數攤派已罄、即停止供給、此種辦法、可知平準會對進口商請給外滙、未必照數核准、而須視規定額數以爲斷、進口貿易商人欲向平準會請給外滙、必須先辦妥運貨之船隻及貨物來源國之各項出口手續、然後備足等値之法幣、向平準會申請供給所需外滙、基金之供給不在事　核准、而在各項手續辦淸以後、至涉及進口貨物依照外滙計算之保險費及運費等、平準會亦得核准供給之、</p>
<p>小額貿易　亦准結滙</p>
<p>凡進口貨物不列入以上甲乙兩類、而其範圍較小、每月總額不超過美金二千元以上者、平準基金委會得斟酌實際情形、供給所需外滙、但此種情形、須先經中國政府之核准、他如私人需要、如國外滙款繳付保險費等、祇要每人每月總數不超過美金兩百元、平準基金會亦同樣核給外滙、如以中國赴外留學生之外滙費用而論、依照行政院規定、在作戰期內、公費留學生非經　准派遣者、一律暫綏派遺、自費留學生除得有國外獎學金或共他外滙補助費足供留學期聞全部費用無須請購外滙者、一律暫　出國、已在國外之公費生、如係學習有　國防之科學、留學費生活費及出國川資、應核給外滙、但　由敎部查明、如已令回國留學生、逾期不回國者、一律不　外滙通知書、凡應付給國外留學生之外滙、皆由敎部咨財部准向平準基金會購買、十四家从邦銀行、僉謂願遵守平準會之規定、　使結滙事宜趨於正規、如平準會核准給滙　、覺原申請不合條例、則　經手銀行須負責將、核供　外滙償還於平準會、</p>
<p>出口匯票　不准拋售</p>
<p>在另一方面、關於出口結匯問題、素爲平準當局所急欲解決者、蓋上海現狀、出口商之結匯、不能由中交兩行辦理、因此出口商遂將所得之匯、向黑市自由拋出、形成黑市難於消滅之理由之一、當局有鑒於此、乃決定凡貨物自其他口岸轉運上海出口時、須在原出口口岸、先行結匯、但對於上海本地貨品外銷之結匯事宜、始終無法彌補、而今平準基金委員會對於此事、經各關係銀行之合作、已獲得解決之途徑、凡向平準會獲得外匯之上海行商、其出口品所得之外匯、必須依照平準會價格、售於十四家銀行中之任何一家、如出售於別處（或黑市）、平準會以後即停止將新價格之外匯供給該行商之進口品貿易、以爲懲戒、不論直接或間接之申請、一概拒絕、但轉滬出口之土貨、在原出口口岸已行結匯者、不在此限、平準會此種關於出口結匯之措置、其目的顯在防止出口商將所得之匯、向黑市拋出、而使黑匯猖獗、如出口商之結匯完全由十四家銀行統制、而黑市賣方絕跡後、專賴向黑市拋匯以資維持之非必需品進口貿易、將遭遇慘重之打擊、</p>
<p>四行尚未　奉到命令</p>
<p>中國國家銀行中中交農四行方面、據新聲社記者昨日自可靠方面探悉、尙未接到總行轉來關於必需品結匯及停止黑市交易之命令、但無論如何、四行將與其他十四家友邦銀行採取同一之步驟、以完成平準基金委員會維護正當貿易杜絕黑市投機之使命、據悉、四行之命令、日內即可抵達、一俟到此、即行開始實行、至於各銀行代客向平準會淸結外匯之申請書、內容已見前報、刻正由關係銀行大量趕印、即分配各進口商家、俾按照平準會規定進行申請必需品外匯手續辦理、此項申請書明日可印就、</p>
<p>昨日黑市　已無依據</p>
<p>據市塲消息、昨日黑市外滙、因外商銀行停止交易、是以交易毫無、已呈有行無市之象、銀行賣價、始終穩定於二便士八五九三七五及四元八四三七五、上項價格、均與上週六同、上午收盤不動、下午開盤均無變化、而昨晨金市、亦因此蕭條異常、價格呆定、此非俟黑滙有適當辦法後、不能打開、而標金期貨黑市塲最近對於期金之結價、自行訂定按照商業滙率及黑市滙牽扯價結價之辦法、又遭嚴重之打擊矣、</p>
<h3>工部局燃料委員會　進行燃料談判　今冬煤價容或微有變動　倘無囤戶操縱毋須恐慌</h3>
<p>工部局燃料委員會、刻正不斷與日方商討增加本埠燃料進口數量、同時警務當局、亦正協力制止一般煤商之壟斷居奇、據本埠煤斤進口商宣稱、本市煤斤到貨並未减少、煤價高漲之主要原因、實爲目前之戰事、太平洋之緊張局勢、以及囤戶所造成之不安狀態、</p>
<p>節電辦法　仍須改善</p>
<p>滬市煤業旣不受統制、一般煤商、不難將煤斤囤積於浦東等處、以待善價而沽、工部局尙未能統制煤斤之售價、但正竭力設法和緩煤斤問題、囤積煤斤者、大抵爲一般商人廠家、上海電力公司現繼續由某廠家每月供給煤斤二萬五千噸、但極盼能再增二萬五千噸、俾改進電力節减問題、</p>
<p>煤斤談判　漸趨順利</p>
<p>日前工部局及電力公司與外商進行之談判、預料今後將漸趨順利、至何時實現則不可知、總之、本年冬季本市煤價雖間有極微之高下、但滬上人十母須恐慌、煤價將隨局勢而有漲落、正與一般商品無異、非至大局好轉、煤價之正常、殊難倖致、工部局及其燃料小組委員會、現正盡力設法减少今冬煤斤用戶之困難、預料不久當可決定相當辦法、希望各界檢舉囤積牟利之煤商、隨時報吿工部局、以便實施實施制裁、</p>

<h3>精神糧食的吸收</h3>
<p>— 伍岱</p>
<p>精神糧食雖甚重要，然而到底沒有肉體的糧食來得根本。說句坦白話：在這生活水準高漲不已的時候，書畫可以不看，飯却不能不吃。這固然是一句百駁不倒的至理名言，然而反過來說，吃飽了飯的人，却不見得人人懂得精神糧食的意義，因為天生人人都會飢餓，而對於精神糧食的欣賞，却是要一步步敎育起來的。</p>
<p>從原始時代到現在，從生食到熟食，可說是人類肉體糧食的唯一的大進步，而瞻望前途，似乎也不會再有了不起的大發展。可是精神糧食方面則不然。文字的發明，使抽象的思想能够有永久的記錄，可說是人類文明的肇始。古登堡發明印刷機，使文字有大量傳播的機會，也替文化界創了一個新紀元。這兩件精神糧食文化史上的大事，促進了人類社會的加速進步與發展。可見精神糧食在歷史進化上所佔地位的重耍。</p>
<p>民以食爲天，這句話沒有人能加以反對。至於精食糧食方面，我們以爲至少思想應以精神糧食爲大。在今日文明的社會上，有願飽食終日而做行屍走肉的人，可說絕無僅有。然而不幸精神糧食却不是人人天生所吃得下的。這需要敎育，提倡，使精神糧食的吸收，成爲一種習慣。</p>

<p>造橋是行軍的先聲，所以把這項也列到裏頭。蜘蛛究竟怎樣所跨過溪流造牠的網，或只是爲波到對岸去呢？湯姆生說：「牠站在高樹枝上，放出一條長絲，讓牠隨風飄蕩，等牠搭到對岸叢莽上。蜘蛛覺得絲囊不再受牽引了，就不再放絲；牠收緊這條絲，使它挺直，把近身的一端牢牢縛在枝上。……」——這不山叫我想起在所看「神秘的剛果」一部影片中，那剛果土人造「籘橋」的法子：用一根極長的籘索繫釗一岸的高樹巔上，然後把索上縛着的人如同蕩鞦韆似的送到溪流的對岸，籘橋的第一根基繩就這樣奠定了。試問這是不是同蜘蛛的行動一樣？</p>
<p>布阱</p>
<p>有的蜘蛛能在墻壁的隙縫中或土地的凹陷處，密密的布上一層網，叫它和墻壁或土地形成同一的平面式：不知迫的昆蟲偶然在上面爬過，便被網上的黏液或繩索牢牢捉住。明人茅元儀所輯武備志對於一陷馬坑」一條上說：「掘土為坑，長五尺，闊深三四尺，……上覆芻草，或種草苗，令敵大不覺。……」我以爲这種計劃和蜘蛛的智慧沒有什麽分別。</p>
<p>防空提起防空這件事來，我們人類眞該慚愧汗顏，自歎遠遠不及蜘蛛了！你看那蜘蛛們所布的各式各色的網吧！橫的豎的，傾斜的，方的，圓的，三角的；墻角裹也有，花枝上也有，屋簷，窗口，到處可見。有什麼大胆的蚊蠅敢橫衝直撞的飛行，不叫牠馬上倒霉，牢牢的被俘據了呢？——我相信人類在樹林裹，業莽裹，支上那掩襲禽獸的綱，是取法於蜘蛛的；難道說不能有一天在那大都市的上空撒上幾千幾百的鐵綱，為的阻擋或捕捉來侵的敵機麽？</p>
<p>潛不</p>
<p>湯姆生父說，有一種蜘蛛竟能在水裏做成一面密不通風的綱，在裏面鼓人乾燥的空氣，然後遊行自如，像似個「潛水鐘。」——想不到小規模的潛艇也能在這種卑賤不堪的動物中找得到！</p>
<p>射擊</p>
<p>澳洲有一種特異的蜘蛛叫「偉蛛。」牠喜歡吃食蛾類却不結綱；牠紡成一條長綫，綫末端附有一滴極黏的物質；牠用一條前肢把道條綫懸吊起來，——『彷彿用釣竿來懸綫：』——遇有蛾經過時，牠便急急的揮轉這條綫；膠滴極黏，只要蛾一碰到了它，便休想掙脫。而且牠的手段極高，有時一揮兩揮，就把飛蛾捉住：——南非洲彼得馬利壁有一種蜘蛛相同，不過牠的長綫是轉個不停的。——這眞可稱爲神槍射擊手了。</p>
<p>罾捉</p>
<p>湯姆生又說：在阿根廷有種蜘蛛，能在淺水邊造個漏斗狀的網，牠能驅逐蚪蝌們鑽進牠這網，然後取來果腹。——我看這很彷彿漁人們所用的罾罩，也不能不說是蜘蛛的一種特異戰術哩。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦廋鷗</p>
<p>十二　意外風波</p>
<p>當晚他和秋海棠兩個人簡直整整商議了一夜，因爲城裏的路畢竟他比秋海棠熱，便決定由他跟了陳大進城，再在城裏用心察訪。</p>
<p>「錢怎能帶得太少呢？」臨動身的時節，秋海棠給了他二十塊錢，他一定祇要五塊錢，秋海棠便自動把其餘的塞進他的衣袋裏去。「小狗子，你的忠心我是知道的！可是俗語說得好，天下事無錢不行，你還是一起帶了去吧！祇要能够早些把姑娘找回來，多化幾個錢我也是願意的。」</p>
<p>小狗子漲紅着臉，把四張鈔票藏了起來。</p>
<p>「你放心吧！爺，要是我小狗子不能把姑娘找回，我這一世，也不能見你了！」他束緊了腰裏拴的那條布帶，站在寒風裏，身子挺得比竹桿還直，臉上一些笑容也沒有，兩條衣袖據得高高的，不時把眼睛斜向對鬥的孟家老舖去，很像馬上要找，孟老掌櫃父干厮打的神氣。</p>
<p>「好在學堂裏也有信送給縣裏去了，也許現在已經我回來了，也說不定。」陳大透着很同情的樣子，向秋海棠說。「何老先生好好地在家裏等我們的消息吧！」</p>
<p>秋海棠勉强放出笑容來，向他點了點頭。（二〇六）</p>
<h3>「出清存貨」</h3>
<p>— 菲了</p>
<p>在紐的，至少有二十家大百貨商店，每年總得來一次「出淸存貨大减價」。時間大都爲三星期，也有因存貨已淸而縮爲一星期的。那個减價，非常澈底，責際，甚至有低於成本到百分之二十五以上者，所以一般門檻精的顧客，莫不趨之若騖。</p>
<p>擄百貨店老闆說：『出淸存貨，可以保持一個買賣寳永不掉到落伍的路上去。」</p>
<p>誠然，「存貨」和「落伍」是一個相等的數字，像二加二等於四那就地相等。要不「落伍」，就得把「存貨」出淸。</p>
<p>今天一般人的頭腦，就需要這個「出清」！</p>
<p>您覺得您的頭發漲嗎？也許是存貨太多了吧！告訴您，存貨是領您距離時代的，多少新的東西，都給牠擯拒了。愈過愈叫您腐迂，愈叫您挨近古董的橱窗，除非您決心「出淸」牠。能够每一年，每一個頭腦都來一次「出淸存貨」，我想不知地上要充滿多少的新鮮，多少的愉快！不止，也許時代的巨輪，已經推進到另一階段了</p>

<h3>英格蘭一老翁</h3>
<p>— 王亮</p>
<p>在柏林的一輛滿了戰士將赴前綫的火車上，站着一個龍鐘老婦，在替她的兒子送行。當話別時，那張縐癟的臉上酸淚涔涔下；旁人羣加呵辱。不料她槪然的說：「我把我的丈夫兒子一個個送上戰錢；他們一個個的爲國捐軀了。現在我送別的是我最後的兒子，以後我再也沒有兒子可以爲國奮鬭了這使我再痛心也沒有了」！</p>
<p>這是一個很動人的故事。故事主角的老婦人當然不朽的，可是現在她恐怕不能專美於前了：</p>
<p>在英格蘭中部一個工廠裏，有個七十五歲的老人在運轉一座重量壓榨機，旣沒有別人的幫助，機器上又缺乏防護器；顯然是太危險了。巡查員見了大爲吃驚，就走近去詢問；他用沈重的語氣答道：「那一點沒有關係。裝了防護器反而妨碍工作；不裝時工作至少可以快三倍。我的兒子現在利比亞（埃及東隣）從軍。他冒的是生命之險；我冒的不過是手指之險啊」！至少這位老翁的請神似乎更加積極吧，我想。</p>

<h3>不怕死的救火員</h3>
<p>— 克忠</p>
<p>在德機的猛烈轟炸下，倫敦的救火人員所擔任的工作，可說是世界上最危險的一種了。爲了要把他們的工作做得更好起見，這些不怕死的救火員，不惜工本，花費大量的金錢與時問，去作大規模的長期苦練。他們在訓練的時候，戴了防毒面具，衝到火烟密佈的屋子裏去，一方面使自己習慣於那種燜熖瀰漫的環境，一方面也試騐自己的防毒面具　是否有損壞的地方，他們所以有道種不怕困難，不避麻煩的奮鬥精神，完全是爲了有一個更大的目標：要從極權主義的威脅中把國家拯救出來。</p>

<h3>埋頭苦學的江泓</h3>
<p>— 未人</p>
<p>好幾次同淸宮怨中的西太后—江泓見面，我們談着一些關於戲劇方面的零碎的問題，她很能說話，而且又非常和氣。本篇所記，是她演戲奮鬥的一個過程，亦即是她藝術磨練的一份報吿。</p>
<p>江泓今年十九歲，是蘇州人，從小生長在北平，家裏父母雙全，有一哥，一弟，一妹。幼年時代，她跟着父親，奔南走北，跑過許多地方，在河南一帶，住的時間比較長久。七七蘆溝橋事變發生，她就和母親，兄，弟，妹妹等來到上海了，只留下父親一個人在重慶鐵道部工作。</p>
<p>最先進啟秀唸書，後來考入光華，這一學期，變爲大學一年級生了，她讀的是政治系</p>
<p>演戲的開始，是在二年之前，她看了夏霞的「人之初」以後，那時有一位同學曾向她說：「江泓，你能演蕭麗蓮這一個角色嗎？」她沒有演過戲，然而却大着胆回答道：「這是一種知識，我願意嘗試着去學習一下。」於是她努力地在藝術方面用功奮鬭了。</p>
<p>先後在「職婦」，「工華」，「光華」，「華光」等劇團客串演過的戲，計有：「舞女淚」，「閨怨」，「被摧殘的生命」，「雷雨」，「一倏狗與一個女人」，「債」，「人之初」等，最近在淸宮怨中演西太后，竟一舉成名</p>
<p>她的演戲，一向是客串的，從來沒有加入過甚麽劇團，也從來沒有拿過甚麽津貼酬勞，她說：「我是因爲喜歡演戲才演戲，除了對藝術切磋以外，其他並無任何需求。」所以她在演戲的時候，不肯馬虎，不願隨便，而是步步當心，刻刻留意。—西太后的成功，自然也不是偶然的。</p>
<p>九月三日起，鐺鐺的鐘聲，把她從舞台上趕到敎室裏去，現在她不在　宮上演了，她說：「開學了，我要好好　讀書，我不能爲了演戲，而荒廢了寳貴的學業。」</p>
<p>說起讀書，她是很用功的，他平時喜歡者莎士比亞，易卜生，蕭伯納等的作品，戲劇理論的書籍，也讀得不少。她在外國電影明星中，是最崇升瑙瑪希拉。</p>
<p>江泓的演技，是我人所欽佩折服的，而尤其是她的埋頭苦學的精神，眞値得作爲每一藝人每一靑年的良好的模範！</p>

<h3>「守財奴」觀後</h3>
<p>— 洛綠</p>
<p>這次華夏公演「守財奴」。</p>
<p>眞是針對着現時的社會，像貪財而吝嗇的華炳剛這樣的人，在這個孤島上眞是不勝枚舉。「守財奴」是一齣五幕的諷刺去喜劇，他的大意是說一偭以　爲第二生命的吝嗇鬼——華炳剛（即守財奴），爲了錢，他對一切人都厭惡而猜疑，甚至連他親生的兒女都不信任。他想娶他自已兒子的愛人范小姐做續絃，但是爲了范家很窮沒有陪嫁，於是他就想出了一個袖救的辦法，就是替他自己的兒子定了一個有錢的寡婦，以便得到一筆豐富的嫁妝。同時，爲了貪嗇而在「不要嫁妝」的條件下，答應了把自己的女兒英梅嫁給紳士范老先生爲室。可是事情並沒有這樣簡單，其中還錯綜複雜的鬧着許多的問題，但結果呢，那位范小姐是嫁給了「守財奴」的兒子，而英梅也去跟了他的愛人結婚。至於華炳剛本人呢，只要錢守得住，其他一切也就顧不得了。演員最成功的當是飾「守財奴」的歐化了，歐化一向是以演老人稱著的，這一次演道個樫吝的老人，是再適合也沒有了。把一個「守財奴」的心理刻劃得淋漓盡致。飾英德的張璆和飾媒婆的蘭茝也是成功的。其餘飾范立瓊的錢冀尙稱職，張永　（王琛飾）似乎台步生硬些，華英梅（鄭翔）台詞可高些，其餘尙可。一個業餘劇社能有這樣優美的成續，是很不容易的了　　簡訊　（一）國聯大戲院一周紀念將屈，已決定獻映「天長地久」，是爲藝華巨片，該院爲示隆重計，特製李綺年香水一種，分贈觀衆。（二）六日爲醫藥博士顧毓琦之令堂顧太夫人五旬晋九壽誕，顧氏昆仲爲娛親計，邀集名票多人在其寓所作半日之淸唱。下午三時許開始，戲目繫多，精彩紛呈，至十時餘始盡歡而散。（三）姜映淸女士善吟詠，工彈詞，曩曾手撰楊貴妃唱篇，交由沈薛開唱，抑揚頓挫，富麗堂皇，聞者重之，今復編著玉梨魂全部彈詞，請薛筱卿擇日播送。（四）中國業餘音樂社，特設「口琴免費班」分初高兩班，聘請鮑明珊負責敎導，一月速成，學費金免，不論男女或已學未學皆可加人，每晚七至九時可至寗波路浙寗大樓三樓報名。</p>
<h3>血雨雨葩</h3>
<p>— 顾明道</p>
<p>第十六章　早携嬌鳥出樊籠</p>
<p>今天國家到了危急關頭，却不想有力者出力，有財奢出財，如何去挽救國家之難，却祗憂盧着自己的安危嗎？太自私自利了。這些人也要他們吃此苦頭哩。伊遂假意對田宏遇說道：。「做國丈的尙沒有法兒想，叫我們小女子有什麼辦法呢？我們是要依賴你的，流寇來時，你們一班公卿，該早出鴻猷去撲滅不使蔓草難圖。平時不知消息於未然，保治於未形，到了大禍臨頭的時候，又不能挺身而出，爲朝廷分憂，這不是很慚愧的嗎？」圓圓說到這裹，極盡嘲諷，田宏遇的臉不由紅了起來，嘆口氣說道：」圓圓，你這話是駡朝上一般文武官員呢？還是針對老夫而發？啊呀！你的話賣備得令人置身無地了。」園道：「我那裏敢說大人的不是？我不過深恨一般大臣不能爲國戡亂，以致時局日壞罷了。假若流寇入京，我準備一死，大人倘然以身殉節，我們便一塊兒死也好。」這句話也是圓圓試探田宏遇的心思，其實圓圓也未必準備一死，伊的芳心別有一種懷想呢。可是田宏遇聽了這話，他的眉弗更是蹙緊了。他搖搖頭道：「死有重於泰山，有輕於鴻毛，我若這樣一死，雖說報君父之恩，然而太沒有意思了。我本來沒握政權，多我一個人未必能爲朝廷之福，那麽我若不在其中，也未必有損於明室，我叉何必死呢？暮年得卿，方以爲天假之緣，正要願花常好，願月常圓，與卿長處永好，你怎麼說起死來呢？老夫却不捨得你死，也不捨得拋棄了這快樂的時日而作塚中人呢。圓圓，我們除了一死之外，難道沒有別的辦法嗎？（一六三）</p>

        <h1>1941.09.09</h1>
<h3>US President to Announce Plan: Strong Naval Construction Policy, Urge Repeal of Neutrality Act and Implementation of Escorts, Greer Incident Increasingly Significant</h3>
<p>United Press International, Hyde Park, 8th: While the content of President Roosevelt's speech has not been formally hinted at, general speculation is that the speech will announce the President's plan to: (1) order the Navy to protect supply ships heading to Britain and all outposts such as Iceland; (2) urge the immediate repeal of the Neutrality Act so that American ships can sail in British and other belligerent waters; (3) build a stronger naval policy to cope with Axis armed vessels attacking within the US Navy patrol zone; and (4) expand aid to Britain and the Soviet Union as a prelude to the introduction of a new Lend-Lease Act. The President is also expected to announce the trend of US-Japan negotiations.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 8th: News from Hyde Park that President Roosevelt is considering escorts in light of the Greer incident has aroused close interest here. However, the details are still unknown. German accusations of the US President's remarks are seen here as ridiculous, as no one believes the Greer had orders to do anything other than defend itself. Furthermore, the Greer was clearly marked, and the submarine commander could not possibly have mistaken the American ship for a British one through his periscope above the water. What initially seemed minor now threatens to become an important diplomatic issue. Although no one believes the United States will enter the war as a result, US-German relations will become even more strained, and future similar incidents are bound to stir American indignation.</p>
<p>United Press International, New York, 8th (Shipping News): Most people in the financial community believe that the United States will participate in the war. Wall Street is already discussing which industries will profit after peace is achieved. Wall Street believes that the United States will eventually be drawn into a "shooting war," based on the premise that the war will definitely be prolonged and that Germany and the United States will inevitably clash over control of Atlantic sea lanes. If peace in Europe is achieved through Germany's victory due to the United States not participating in the war, its impact on the American economy will be very different from the scenario where the United States participates in proposing peace terms.</p>
<p>Havas, New York, 7th: The New York Times recently commented on the USS Greer incident, stating that the Neutrality Act has now lost its meaning, and the various restrictions it stipulates should be reconsidered. In short, the time has come to arm American merchant ships and have them escorted by the fleet to their destinations.</p>
<p>Havas, Swiss Capital, 7th: A correspondent for the Neue Zürcher Zeitung in Berlin reports that Germany has no intention of negotiating with the United States regarding the USS Greer incident and intends to drop the matter. This is evidenced by the fact that German newspapers are avoiding commenting on it. However, the general public in Berlin is quietly awaiting President Roosevelt's speech, as Roosevelt is certain to address the issue of Iceland.</p>
<h3>New York Studies Population Evacuation, Plan in Draft</h3>
<p>United Press International, New York, 8th: Under the guidance of New York Lieutenant Governor Poletti and Housing Commissioner Weinfeldt, New York is studying various issues related to wartime population evacuation. The plan is currently in the drafting stage, but it is understood that the organizers are planning to move one million women, children, the elderly, and the sick to quiet towns and villages. The main problem, of course, is how to find places to live for the evacuees. A survey is underway in Sullivan County in southwestern New York State to determine how many people it can accommodate in an emergency. Representatives from the New York State Housing Department and the Health Department recently met with officials from the Sullivan County Hotel Owners Association. The hotel owners will cooperate in a survey to determine how many evacuees can be accommodated on farms, how many places are available in various annual hotel camp clubs and other buildings, and how much work is needed to make other hotels suitable for year-round residence (Sullivan County is a summer resort). In addition, committees will study the quantity of water and sanitation facilities, as well as transportation issues. Evacuation officials are studying methods to place evacuees as close as possible to the city without overburdening the department's transportation facilities. Inland families are considered the most suitable, or assistance may be requested from neighboring areas such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut, as there may be suitable locations there.</p>
<h3>Brazilian President Delivers Speech Celebrating Independence Day, Preparing to Resist Aggression</h3>
<p>Reuters, Brazilian Capital, 8th: In a speech to the public on Brazil's Independence Day, the Brazilian President said that the policy of the Americas is that aggression from any direction will be resisted by the largest number of countries forming a defensive alliance. Brazil's 119th Independence Day can still be celebrated with joy, as Brazil, both government and people, has been able to avoid war despite difficult times. Brazil is a peaceful country, aiming to avoid the terrible war, but we cannot foresee how things will develop. We must be prepared and not harbor optimistic illusions.</p>
<p>US Promises Material Aid to Brazil</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 8th</p>
<p>President Roosevelt's speech scheduled for Brazil's Independence Day was read by his secretary due to the death of his mother. It warned all free people of the world that "no nation can escape" the aggression sweeping across Europe and Asia and urged the establishment of democratic peace and justice throughout the world, further promising material assistance to Brazil.</p>
<h3>Britain Takes Firm Stand, Strengthens Malaya's Strength, Large Number of Bombers Arrive in Singapore, Cooper Gives Speech on Bandit Island</h3>
<p>United Press International, Singapore, 8th: British military authorities issued a communique stating that another large number of the latest Blenheim bombers arrived in Singapore today, further enhancing the Royal Air Force's offensive capabilities in the Far East. As a result, Malaya's offensive and defensive capabilities have increased threefold in one week. A large number of Indian troops and British artillery regiments arrived here last Wednesday. On Saturday, thousands of Indian troops and a Scottish artillery regiment arrived. They are all equipped with the latest weapons and are fully mechanized. The communique stated that for some time, our policy has been to strengthen the Royal Air Force in Malaya with aircraft shipped from the United States. However, recently, in addition to the arrival of a large number of officers and soldiers, repair equipment and complete aircraft have been shipped from British factories. This means that the Royal Air Force in the Far East is now supplied with personnel and materials from Britain, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. The new Blenheim bombers shipped from Britain have a maximum speed of 300 miles per hour when fully loaded and can stay in the sky for six hours.</p>
<p>United Press International, Manila, 8th: Duff Cooper arrived here today on the Anzac Clipper, accompanied by his wife, Diana, and his staff, including former Shanghai Municipal Council officials Dong Kaiziwei and Russell. They will continue to Singapore tomorrow on the Clipper. Duff Cooper declared that he believes Japan will carefully consider its future actions because Britain will take a firm stand in the Far East. He also said that he expects to stay in the Far East for three to four months, mostly in Singapore, but he hopes to visit the Dutch East Indies, Australia, Hong Kong, Chongqing, and Burma. He said that he came to the Far East to investigate and report to the British War Cabinet on whether to appoint a representative to the Far East to manage political issues at the highest level, as a position already established in the Middle East. He also said that the eight British countries are willing to give up part of American aid to supply the Soviet Union. This will be a major topic of discussion at the upcoming Moscow Three-Power Conference. He will also investigate whether British raw materials in the Far East, such as rubber and tin, can be supplied to the Soviet Union. Kai Ziwei said that he expects to return to Shanghai after the war to resume his duties at Jardine Matheson.</p>
<h3>Three US Oil Tankers Pass Japan Bound for Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Havas, Rome, 8th: The Roman People's Paper recently reported that three more American oil tankers have passed through Japanese waters bound for Vladivostok, Soviet Union.</p>
<p>United Press International, New York, 8th: According to NBC, Sydney Radio reported today that the third American oil tanker carrying aviation gasoline to supply the Soviet Union has arrived in Vladivostok.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Mother Dies, Important Speech Postponed, Mrs. Roosevelt Sr. Devoted to Charity During Her Lifetime, Funeral Held Today in Hyde Park</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 8th: Mrs. Roosevelt Sr., mother of US President Roosevelt, felt unwell on the night of the 5th, and her condition worsened the next day, falling into a coma for 12 hours. Doctors believed it was due to circulatory failure due to old age. She passed away at 11:15 AM (Eastern Time) on the 7th, at the age of 87. President Roosevelt and his wife were at her bedside when she passed away. A private funeral will be held on the 9th. Mrs. Roosevelt Sr. was born in Newburgh, New York. In her childhood, her father traveled to the Far East for business, and she lived in Hong Kong for many years. She returned to the United States in 1880 and married James Roosevelt. James passed away in 1900, when the President was only 18 years old. His mother raised him into adulthood and witnessed his rise to become a world figure. In 1937, when she was 83 years old, she was invited by the French government to visit the Paris Exposition and was welcomed by the French government and people. She was devoted to charity throughout her life. She often resided in a villa near Val-Kill this summer and came to Hyde Park at the end of last month.</p>
<p>Reuters, Hyde Park, 8th: The funeral of Mrs. Roosevelt Sr. will be held at home, with only relatives and elderly neighbors attending. She will be buried in the family cemetery behind St. James Church, in a plot to the left of her husband James's tomb, according to Dutch custom.</p>
<p>United Press International, Hyde Park, 8th: Mrs. Roosevelt Sr. passed away yesterday at her ancestral private residence on the Hudson River. She had opposed her son's political activities but had personally witnessed Roosevelt being elected President of the United States three times.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 7th: Mrs. Roosevelt Sr. was born on September 21, 1854, the daughter of a banker. She had only one son, President Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 8th: President Roosevelt originally intended to deliver an important speech tonight. According to CBS, it has been postponed to the evening of the 11th.</p>

<h3>Chairman Lin Sends Condolences to Roosevelt</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 8th: After news of the death of Mrs. Roosevelt Sr. reached Chongqing, Chairman Lin of the National Government sent a telegram of condolences to President Roosevelt, stating, "Deeply shocked and grieved to learn of the passing of your esteemed mother. I hereby send my condolences."</p>
<h3>Australian Business Leader Discusses Mission to Britain, Seeks Close Liaison Between Both Sides on Major Wartime Issues</h3>
<p>Reuters, Sydney, 8th: Sir Page, the Australian business leader who will soon go to London as a representative of the Australian government, stated last night, "My work is to establish direct contact between the British and Australian Cabinets. I am directly responsible to the Australian Parliament and people. The most important purpose of my mission is to present Australia's strategic views on certain major issues and the near future. The decisive purpose is to devise the best plan to maintain the system of direct participation in the Cabinet in London."</p>
<p>Reuters, Sydney, 8th: Australian Prime Minister Fadden broadcast yesterday, reviewing two years of war efforts, saying that at least one in every four Australians of military age has enlisted, so the Australian army, navy, and air force personnel total 400,000. In another two years, this number will exceed 600,000. Another 200,000 people are directly or indirectly engaged in the production of munitions and supplies. The number of Australian naval personnel has tripled, and the number of air force personnel has increased sevenfold.</p>
<p>Former Minister Calls for Radical Action, Kaito Advocates Concessions</p>
<p>Havas, Tokyo, 7th: Former Home Minister General Suekichi recently told a reporter from the Asahi Shimbun that a ship should not return before a storm occurs. Therefore, the current situation gives us the feeling of sailing in a storm. No matter how fierce the headwinds are, we should not change course at first. I am willing to serve the Emperor as an ordinary citizen. Although the Imperial Rule Assistance Association has not been able to submit a report to the government, it has paid close attention to the wishes and suggestions of the people. It is reported that General Suekichi is a leader of the extreme right wing in Japan. Recently, he resigned as chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association due to disagreements with Prime Minister Konoe on diplomatic matters.</p>
<p>Havas, Tokyo, 7th: Prominent political commentator Muto has recently published articles in the "Hochi Shimbun" advocating Japan-US understanding and urging Japan to adopt a moderate attitude. One article, titled "Building a Hundred-Year Plan for East Asia," states, "When a country is expanding its power abroad, it must be able to rein in its horses at the edge of the cliff when necessary, so that it can get a chance to breathe and make a comeback in the future." I still remember after the Sino-Japanese War in the mid-19th century, Japan demanded that China cede the Liaodong Peninsula, but Russia, Germany, and France united to oppose it. We had no choice but to make concessions. If we had been willing to fight the three countries at that time to achieve our long-cherished wish, what would have happened? As a result, we would have failed due to exhaustion of our strength. Therefore, if our country can temporarily retreat and work twice as hard to complete its great cause in the future, it should resolutely do so. I dare say that even if we do our best to build a "New East Asia," it cannot be done in less than a hundred years." The Hochi Shimbun was originally a pro-German nationalist newspaper but was recently acquired by the Yomiuri Shimbun. Muto has always been regarded as a powerful figure opposed to Britain and the United States, so his views are quite intriguing.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Invading Taihu Area Have Been Repelled, Fierce Fighting Now Taking Place South of Yueyang, Japanese Troops in Fuzhou Were Forced to Withdraw</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesman declared today that fierce fighting is now taking place south of Yuezhou after Japanese troops began an attack there on Sunday morning.

It is reported that between August 30 and September 3, 4,500 Japanese troops in three columns attacked multiple strongholds on the south bank of Taihu Lake but were all repelled to their original bases in Wuxing, Changxing, and a certain area of Wujiang. The spokesman also said that the Japanese army lost 6,000 men during its 135-day occupation of Fuzhou. The spokesman admitted that Chinese troops only entered Fuzhou after the Japanese troops had completely withdrawn. However, he said that there was much evidence in the city of Fuzhou to show that the Japanese troops had withdrawn in haste. Most of the military equipment in Fuzhou and Magong remained untouched, and the warehouses and docks were not destroyed, which showed that the Japanese troops were forced to withdraw. (UPI, 8th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Interpreting Mr. Milne's New Economic Policy</h3>
<p>Mr. Milne, Chairman of the British House of Commons National Expenditure Committee, recently delivered a speech outlining a new economic policy. This symbolizes the will of the public and their high expectations. With Mr. Milne's position, he frankly expresses his just aspirations, which shows the yearnings of the people. Mr. Milne first cites the heavy impact of the economic panics of 1921 and 1931 and the uneconomical relief measures as the basis for reforming economic policy. Firstly, a good economic system should not only provide prescribed relief for the elderly, those unable to work due to chronic illness, and the unemployed, but also ensure that everyone obtains permanent work and remuneration. Secondly, the monetary and financial policies in a good system must enable everyone to enjoy the country's resources and achieve stable prices. However, judging from the past twenty years, the reality is far from the aforementioned goals. This is why the system urgently needs to be corrected.</p>
<p>Mr. Milne then eloquently argues that the lack of consumption has been an obstacle to the past economic system, while the progress of modern science has continuously improved and simplified production methods. This indicates that today's problem is one of consumption, not production. It is often heard that millions of people suffer from cold and hunger, while at the same time, huge amounts of food are thrown into the sea or burned to create artificial scarcity and secure higher prices. The powerful vitality of consumption in promoting production and efficiency is ignored. Any increase in wages is inevitably pointed to as raising costs, not realizing that this is an unnecessary worry. Even if the cost calculated in monetary units increases indefinitely, what does it matter if it is supported by sufficient consumption? It is not difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>The importance of consumption is so great that it cannot be measured by ordinary logic. To merely provide relief for life and cultivate a dependence on unearned income is a modern, unfortunate contradiction. Some say that this is due to the lack of work to control and is a measure of last resort. However, the reason for this is entirely due to the lack of consumption. If work can be given and rewarded, the necessary consumption can be generated, which in turn promotes increased production and work. This point may seem illusory and specious at first glance, but if one examines the operation of the current economic structure, one will realize that the role of consumption is like a machine that needs to be fueled and stoked to drive its work. The income earned can then be used to clear the initial consumption expenditure. It is often said that there are too many people for the available jobs, but in fact, the problem is that there are too few jobs for the available people. The reason for this is that we do not know what to do with them. We now know how to recycle waste, so how can there be wasted people who should be left idle? In other words, in the modern economic structure, human resources are still the most important factor. Therefore, we must make good use of this precious factor to benefit the construction of national and social undertakings.</p>
<p>So where does the vitality of consumption lie? Even if we want to consume, if there is no medium of currency and no standard of value, how can we achieve this goal? The key to this lies in the proper use of currency and its smooth circulation and solution. Today, everything has its definite and unshakeable measure and weight, but the standard of currency value is uniquely absent. When Sir Macmillan compiled the report in 1931, he focused on the stability of currency value, but to no avail. Moreover, the stability of currency value is not limited to the issue of units. The impact of the use of large amounts of funds on the vitality of consumption and the maintenance of currency levels is important. Therefore, we must also consider the issue of credit lending.</p>
<p>The operation of banks in lending has always been based on the interests of shareholders. However, under the conditions after the war, the maintenance of price levels and the control of the expansion and contraction of credit lending must be the starting point. At the same time, the settlement of international payments must be clearly separated from domestic production and consumption and must not be intertwined. In the past, when there was a deficit in international payments and gold was exported for repayment, domestic credit lending was often tightened, leading to a sudden drop in production or a decline in consumption, resulting in panic. In order to realize the aforementioned new economic policy, it is advisable to establish a new central bank or expand the functions of the existing central bank, and issue more credit lending chips with commercial paper as collateral, including short-term production and sales of goods, long-term fixed assets, and other construction assets that can enhance social prosperity and happiness as collateral; however, all speculative transactions will be excluded.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Milne loudly proclaimed that money has been the master of men for too long. We must make it our servant before we can. The key to the institutional problem lies in stimulating conscience, not in transforming the mind.</p>
<p>In summary, the brewing of the new economic policy has been going on for a long time, and Mr. Milne's suggestion is undoubtedly a response to the will of Heaven and the people. Moreover, it has many insightful and unique points. It will undoubtedly be an important plan for institutional reform. Looking back at China's economic structure, it is inevitable that there are shortcomings. Therefore, the need for adjustment after the war is urgent. Therefore, this explanation is provided as a source of inspiration for others.</p>
<h3>Chinese Government Satisfied with US-Japan Talks, Government Spokesman Jiang Tingfu Speaks</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Government spokesman Dr. Jiang Tingfu, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, stated today that the Chinese government is very satisfied with the US-Japan talks held in Washington. However, he declined to say whether the United States had notified the Chinese government of the situation in the talks. Jiang said that China is not worried about the United States resuming the sale of oil and steel to Japan and the Soviet Union. Jiang also explained the important reforms in the financial system implemented by China at the beginning of this year, which will result in a greater enhancement of China's financial unity. He pointed out that the provinces have been politically unified in recent years, and until now, they have been virtually completely independent financially. However, starting on January 1, 1942, there will be other important changes. Most of the taxes will be collected by the central government, and the budgets of the provinces will also be prepared by the central government. (UPI, 8th)</p>
<h3>Military Affairs Commission Transportation Control Bureau: Chairman Chiang Concurrently Serves as Director, Yu Fei-peng Fills Deputy Director Position, Chen Yi Succeeds as Director of Rear Service</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Military Affairs Commission Transportation Control Bureau is headed by Chairman Chiang, who also serves as director. The Minister of Transportation, Zhang Jia'ao, concurrently held the position of deputy director. However, due to Zhang's heavy workload, he could not manage both positions. The bureau's chief of staff, Yu Fei-peng, has now taken over the deputy director role. Qian Dajun has been appointed as the new chief of staff. To focus on bureau affairs, Yu has resigned from his position as Director of the Rear Service Department. Chen Yi, the recently relieved chairman of Fujian, will succeed him in this vacant position. This personnel change indicates that the government will further strengthen transportation management to increase efficiency, with a particular focus on the Yunnan-Burma Road. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<h3>Sichuan-Xikang Development Corporation to be Established Next Month</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Sichuan-Xikang Development Corporation is expected to be formally established next month. It is currently raising funds and actively preparing for its establishment. The company held a preparatory committee meeting in Chongqing in mid-last month, appointing responsible personnel and a secretariat to carry out the preparatory work. The secretariat began operations on the first of this month. The primary task is fundraising. According to regulations, the capital stock is 70 million yuan, with 40% from government and 30% from private sources. The government share includes 30 million yuan from the national treasury, 7 million yuan from the Sichuan provincial treasury, and 3 million yuan from the Xikang provincial treasury, all of which have been allocated. The private shares are being raised from local gentry and merchants in the two provinces, totaling 300,000 shares, each at 100 yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%. Interest is paid each term. Huang Jilu, Deputy Chairman of the Preparatory Committee, and Commissioner Xu Kan recently hosted a banquet for the local business community to discuss share subscriptions, which resulted in a very satisfactory outcome. Secretary-General Deng Hanxiang also traveled to Chengdu to discuss share subscriptions with various sectors. It is expected that the private shares will be fully subscribed this month. Another preparatory committee and board meeting will be held in early October to appoint a general manager, after which the corporation can commence operations.

<p>Hong Kong: Mr. Fox, the chief American representative of the Chinese Currency Stabilization Fund Committee, arrived in Hong Kong today from Manila. At the same time, the Stabilization Committee announced that Anglo-American banks have agreed to fully cooperate with the committee. Although it had been reported that "Mr. McKie, Supervisor of the Citibank China branches in Shanghai, and Mr. Hawkins, Manager of the Mercantile Bank of India, London and China in Shanghai, will meet with Mr. Fox," they suddenly returned to Shanghai today after staying here for several days.

<h3>Japan's Misunderstanding of China Will Inevitably Lead to Greater Difficulties, Endner Publishes Essay in New York</h3>
<p>New York: Mr. Endner, the famous Australian advisor to Chairman Chiang, wrote in the "Colliers Magazine" yesterday that Japan cannot defeat China. On the contrary, the Japanese army will be broken up in Chinese territory. Mr. Endner's article was published in the September 13th issue of the magazine, which was sold in advance yesterday. Mr. Endner has been with Chairman Chiang for many years and is regarded by Chairman Chiang as his most trusted confidant. Mr. Endner stated that Japan's main mistakes regarding China are as follows: (1) Failing to understand the new patriotic fervor, unity, and fighting spirit of the Republic of China. (2) Tokyo believes that the Chinese people will "not be able to endure." (3) Regarding the actions of the Japanese army, Mr. Endner stated that the Chinese army is using guerrilla tactics to cause great difficulties for the Japanese army. He also stated that China will not collapse due to the withdrawal of German military advisors, because the country had a complete organization from the beginning of the war to strive for victory. Mr. Endner also said that the Japanese army has repeatedly tried to shorten the war front in China, but without success, and is being constrained and unable to seek peace with China to engage in other adventurous endeavors. Mr. Endner said that Japan has discovered that it is being broken up in China. Mr. Endner also expressed his respect for Chairman Chiang's statement that "As long as the Japanese army is in China for one day, there will be no peace." (United Press, 8th)</p>

<h3>On the Central Gomel Front, Soviet Counteroffensive Achieves Great Victory, Fierce Fighting Intensifies on the Outskirts of Leningrad, Soviets Utilize Swamps to Greatly Defeat German Advance</h3>
<p>United Press, Reek, 8th: The "Zürich" newspaper stated yesterday that several reports indicate that Soviet troops have begun a fierce counteroffensive with a large army and a large number of armored units, including four heavy armored divisions. It also stated that this fierce counteroffensive is apparently taking place on the central front, led by Marshal Timoshenko, and on the Nepor River front, commanded by Marshal Budyonny, making a strong strategic move against several points on the east bank of the German army. The Soviet army is also attempting to cross the Nepor River. The newspaper stated, however, that the German army said that the Soviet army has been repelled and suffered great losses. It also stated that the Soviet counteroffensive is temporarily intended to make the German army focus its attention on defensive work.</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 8th: The army mouthpiece "Red Star" stated yesterday that the Soviet counteroffensive in the Koks Heem and Gomel areas has achieved another victory. The news stated that the infantry in the Gomel area took the offensive against the left flank of the German vanguard, destroying its resistance. The Red Army therefore recovered several villages and towns. The Soviet troops in the Koks Heem area defeated the German army. It is heard that the German side scurried away from the deep forest.</p>
<p>Havas, somewhere on the Soviet border, 7th: The general trend of the war on the Western Front today is as follows: In the northern sector, the fierce fighting on the outskirts of Leningrad is intensifying. The German army is pouring all its artillery and air force to obtain some ground in the suburbs of the city, and is now using long-range heavy artillery to bombard the city in an attempt to take it in one fell swoop. The Red Army is using the swampy areas to launch a desperate counteroffensive against the German army, trying to force the German army to abandon mobile warfare and switch to positional warfare, and to prevent the Finnish army in the north from connecting with the German army in the southwest. In the central and southern sectors of Gomel and Kiev, the fighting is also very fierce, and both sides have suffered heavy losses. In the southern sector, the Odessa area and the lower reaches of the Nepor River are temporarily in a stalemate. The situation of the Red Army there is very stable.</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 8th: Soviet aircraft yesterday heavily bombed the German troops attacking Leningrad, causing heavy casualties to the Germans. An official communiqué stated that Soviet aircraft groups have cooperated with the army to defend Leningrad. It also stated that in the more southerly area, Soviet aircraft also bombed the German army and inflicted heavy casualties.</p>
<p>International News Agency, Moscow, 8th: According to Moscow's official broadcast news, fierce air battles are continuing over the besieged Leningrad and its entrance. The "Stalin's Falcons" have shot down more than 300 German aircraft. Tens of thousands of workers in Leningrad are building new defense works along the city. Marshal Voroshilov stated that the Soviet army will fight to the "last man" to prevent the German army from invading.</p>
<p>Havas, Stockholm, 8th: The Finnish army stopped its advance after taking Vyborg a week ago. Now it has launched another offensive yesterday to join the German army in encircling Leningrad. The Finnish army has already reached the southern end of the Svir River between Lake Ladoga and Lake Onéga, about 125 miles from Leningrad.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 8th: According to recent news here, the German army has not approached the southwest side of Leningrad and is even further away from the communication lines southeast of the city. Although the railway passing through Leningrad is temporarily blocked, the German army has not occupied the southwest and southeast communication lines, so it is absurd to say that the city has been isolated. At the same time, the Soviet army has continued to report victories in local battles in the western region. In a certain area of Gomel, a certain Soviet infantry division, after defeating the German army's fierce resistance, has recovered several places with many residents, and destroyed 21 German tanks and many artillery pieces. At another location in the western region, the bridgehead built by the German army on the Kerma River was destroyed by Soviet aircraft dive-bombing, and hundreds of German soldiers were killed and unable to cross the river. Soviet aircraft also attacked two airfields, destroying 25 German aircraft and damaging many others in the fields.</p>
<p>The latest Soviet communiqué did not disclose new developments, only stating that on September 7, the Soviet army continued to fight fiercely with the enemy along the entire line. The Soviet Air Force launched a concentrated attack on the enemy army and attacked the enemy air force in the airfields, destroying a total of 23 enemy aircraft, including air battles. The Soviets lost 11 aircraft. The German submarine U-73 Wren was captured by the Soviets in the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>Leningrad's Defenses Are Strong, Nazi Offensive at a Loss</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th: Military commentators say that the battle for Leningrad at the end of the week is still quite fierce. Both sides are evenly matched and the outcome is uncertain. The latest Soviet communiqué is brief, only stating that the war is continuing. The German side also only routinely claims that the war is "proceeding according to plan." Although the German army is launching a huge offensive, it seems that there are no concrete battle results to report since it declared two days ago that Leningrad was under fire. Even if the statement that the city is under fire is true, it is not of particular significance, because Odessa on the Black Sea, Tobruk in North Africa, and even Dover in England are all under German fire, but the German army can only hope for them but not touch them. The seriousness of the German offensive against Leningrad cannot be underestimated. Undoubtedly, the Soviet side knows the strategic importance of the city, so it is doing its best to defend it. If Leningrad falls before winter arrives, then a portion of the German army there can move inland and spy on Moscow, and it can use the port of Leningrad as a valuable supply base to avoid the suffering of transportation through muddy and snowy roads. However, the Gulf of Finland is frozen for several months in the winter, so it will still be obstructed by ice. The German army is now encountering Leningrad's impregnable defenses. The city can only be seriously threatened in the southwest direction, but that direction is protected by three lines of concentrated fortresses. Its strength is worthy of being the strongest defense in the world. Although it is not necessarily unbreakable, the German army will suffer heavy casualties if it wants to capture the city. Even if the German army reaches the suburbs of this large city with three million people, its difficulties will only begin, because the outer waterways and canals are intertwined and cannot be easily crossed. The southern district of the city alone has five canals, while the east and west are protected by the 400-yard-wide Neva River. The Soviet army is determined to fight step by step in every riverbank and every house. Since winter is approaching rapidly, it is not difficult to imagine that the German army will suffer great casualties and losses before it publishes a communiqué declaring that it has captured Leningrad "according to plan."</p>
<p>Fierce Battles on the Highway to Odessa, Over Ten Thousand German and Romanian Troops Killed or Wounded</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 8th: There is still fierce fighting on the highway to Odessa. The German and Romanian troops have suffered heavy losses. More than 10,000 people have been killed or wounded in a few days. There are too many German wounded, and there are not enough ambulances to distribute them, so that half of the wounded die before reaching the hospital.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 8th: A Spanish newspaper's Berlin dispatch stated that the Soviet troops stationed in Odessa have no shortage of air support. Although the seven airfields in the area are only used for supplies and cannot be used as air force bases, Soviet military aircraft fly non-stop from Crimea to Odessa, challenging the German air control.</p>
<p>In Two Months of Fighting on the Eastern Front, Over Seven Thousand German Aircraft Damaged or Destroyed</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 8th: Soviet Air Force Major General Gordendal wrote an article published in "Red Star" stating that the German side has almost used its entire air force to attack the Soviet Union, and has failed to achieve its main goal in two months of fighting, which is to gain absolute air superiority. Moreover, the air battles have proven that the Soviet Air Force is not only not weaker than the German side, but also superior to it in many aspects. The enemy has also admitted that the Soviet aircraft's new fighter jets are of excellent quality. The German side has lost more than 7,200 aircraft in the recent two months of war against the Soviet Union. This kind of battle result is unprecedented in the history of air warfare. More than 2,000 enemy aircraft have been destroyed on the ground by the Soviet Air Force. The Soviet artillery also inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. Enemy aircraft teams scattered in disorder when attacked by Soviet aircraft. On the first day of the war, the 51st and 54th Bomber Squadrons of the German Air Force Aviation Corps, commanded by General Glim, lost three-tenths of their aircraft, and the 55th Squadron lost half. The German Air Force suffered the heaviest losses in the operational areas of the German Corps Generals Kesselring and Stumpff on the western and southwestern fronts. Before the German attack on the Soviet Union, it lost 300 aircraft in 1939, 6,800 aircraft in 1940, and 1,350 to 1,700 aircraft in the first five months of 1941. Currently, the German side is mostly using the Heinkel 111, Dornier 215, Junkers 88, and Messerschmitt 109 models, and is also trying its best to accelerate the production of the new Heinkel 123 fighter. Captured German pilots said that they highly regarded the Soviet new fighter jets, which they called EYC-17. In this decisive war, the Soviet side did not use large airfields, and most of the bases were small airfields with 40 to 50 aircraft that were well hidden. If the range of activity and intensity of the front line from Barents to the Black Sea continues unchanged, then the losses of German aircraft will inevitably increase greatly in another two or three months. At present, the German Air Force only has several thousand pilots with good technical skills, and the rest are trained in haste. The result will be an increase in its losses. According to German prisoners, most of the current German pilots only entered the air force in the second half of 1940 or the first half of this year. Furthermore, before the German attack on the Soviet Union, if it mobilized a part of its air force to fight, its aircraft factories could still replenish the lost aircraft. From May to September of last year, the German Air Force was fully mobilized, and its aircraft replenishment capacity had reached its limit. Therefore, in these five months, it was no longer able to expand the German Air Force. The German side lost less than 9,000 aircraft in the wars before the attack on the Soviet Union, but the German side had to make extra efforts to replenish them, and sometimes had to reduce the scope of its air force's military operations. From this, it can be seen how significant the losses of the German Air Force in the war against the Soviet Union are. Now, the German Air Force is forced to reduce the scope of its operations and transfer its aircraft teams back and forth on the front line, and even if German aircraft factories work as quickly as possible, they cannot replenish the German aircraft's major losses. The strength of the Soviet Air Force is inexhaustible and is increasing day by day.</p>
<h3>Soviet Women's World Holds Anti-Fascist Conference, Resolves to Appeal to the World to Unite, British Women's Groups Telegraph in Response</h3>
<p>Havas, Moscow, 7th: The Soviet women's world held an anti-fascist conference here today, and immediately passed a resolution by unanimous vote, appealing to women in all countries of the world, especially women in the United Kingdom and the United States, to unite and form a women's anti-Nazi front.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th: Thirty-eight British women, representing various national work, religious, political, social and sports activities, have telegraphed congratulations to the Soviet women's conference held yesterday, saying, "We British women welcome Soviet women as comrades in the struggle of all free people against the Nazi threat. Like Soviet women, we stand side by side with the men on the front line in homes, factories and armies.

<h3>Three Terrorist Incidents in Paris in One Night, French Communist Party's Hatred of Germany Deepens</h3>
<p>Havas, Paris, 7th: Three more anti-German terrorist incidents occurred here last night: (1) An administrative staff member in the German-occupied zone was shot and slightly injured by two thugs. (2) A German non-commissioned officer was also shot and wounded. (3) Incendiary bombs were thrown at a German military vehicle shed, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished. Regarding these unexpected incidents, the general impression obtained by the responsible parties here is that they are clearly the result of a communist conspiracy. This can be seen from the propaganda booklet published by the party on August 15, which stated that if one member of the French Communist Party is executed, ten Germans will be made to pay with their lives. At the same time, the former leader of the French Communist Party, the former Vice President of the Chamber of Deputies, Dorères, also made a declaration on the Peruvian radio station, inciting the French to rebel, including the words "Hitler is invading the Soviet Union with the army of the whole country, we must not miss this opportunity."</p>

<p>Reuters, Ankara, August 8th - Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister, Mr. Menemencioglu, is worried that he will be unable to immediately hold business negotiations with the German Trade Representative, Mr. Clodius. Mr. Clodius arrived in Istanbul by plane yesterday with many commercial members and is now heading here. The Turkish delegation will be led by Mr. Gischimi, a commercial advisor. It is widely believed that the new commercial agreement will stipulate barter trade worth 20 million pounds. However, given the defense uses of transportation and the difficulties of sea and air traffic, the German side may not be able to obtain all the benefits it expects from this commercial agreement. It is heard from Turkish commercial circles that the German side is very keen to obtain chromium, which Germany does not currently need, but wants to buy it in order to diplomatically strike a blow against Britain. It is said that nine German economic experts came with Mr. Clodius.</p>

<h3>Random Talk on the European War (7) (8) The Soviet Economic Defense Line</h3>
<p>This article is a record from the American Christian Science Monitor, and is translated as follows:</p>
<p>Even if Hitler breaks through the "Stalin Line," Soviet resistance will not end.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has five economically self-sufficient Russias, each with its own natural resources and agriculture and industry. Their level of development is such that they can maintain the survival, supply, and equipment of an army when the region loses contact with other parts. Among them, apart from two regions, namely the original industrial area in the northwest (including Moscow and Leningrad) and the Ukrainian area in the Don River basin in the European part, the remaining three regions, namely the Ural region, the Kuznetsk basin, and the Far East Pacific region, are all located in Asia.</p>
<p>Even if Hitler occupies Moscow, he is still a thousand miles away from the Ural Mountains, the border between Europe and Asia, which is the Soviet Union's second industrial defense line.</p>
<p>Building new industrial areas out of reach of the enemy has always been the main policy of the Soviet Union's economic plan. The gradual eastward shift of the Soviet Union's center of gravity is due to this. The Soviet government had no prior connection with Asia, but for strategic reasons, they had to pay attention to the East.</p>
<p>Under the first and second Soviet five-year plans, large-scale factories, such as the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Plant and the Kuznetsk Metal Plant, have been established on the bald slopes of the eastern Ural Mountains and the desolate plains of Siberia. The steel produced by each factory far exceeds the total national steel production before the implementation of the industrialization plan.</p>
<p>The initial construction plan of the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Plant was originally intended to be larger than the Krupp Iron and Steel Plant, but it was reduced by half according to the original plan, but it is still the Soviet Union's number one iron factory. The implementation of this great plan has made the area a prosperous town of 200,000 residents.</p>
<p>In 1938, the Magnitogorsk plant produced 1.5 million tons of pig iron and 1.7 million tons of pure steel, which is more than the total annual output of Sweden, Czechoslovakia, and Poland before the war.</p>
<p>There are other steel plants, as well as copper and aluminum plants, etc., in the Ural region, which have either started construction or are under construction. The Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant, which supplies two-thirds of the country's tractors and tanks, is also located in the area. In addition, there are factories that manufacture aircraft and cannons and shells of various calibers. Although the Soviet authorities keep the production quantity and details of each factory strictly secret, it is said that these factories in the Ural region alone can continuously supply their army with various weapons and military supplies.</p>
<p>1,500 miles east of the Ural Mountains is the Kuznetsk basin, located in the heart of Siberia, and is Lenin's ideal eastern industrial area.</p>
<p>The coal produced in Kuznetsk accounts for more than one-fifth of the country's total production, second only to the Don River basin. Most of the coal is now transported to factories in the Ural region, Magnitogorsk, and Nizhny Tagil. The area also has rich reserves of metals such as iron, copper, and manganese. A large-scale steel plant in Nanso, a large-scale chemical industry plant, and two rubber factories have all been partially put into operation.</p>
<p>The rise of the German army and the increased threat of invasion have forced the Soviet Union to accelerate its eastward development, but the Soviet Union's economic defense strategy had already taken shape in early 1939, which is the so-called third five-year plan, and its detailed content was announced two years later. The main feature of this strategy is to divide the Soviet Union's industrial and economic map into five self-sufficient units, each with its own resources and agricultural and industrial manufacturing plants, and its strength is equal to or even surpasses that of a certain European power.</p>
<p>The new plan focuses on developing local fuel production, locating new factories near raw material production areas, and making every effort to produce grain locally. In order to encourage grain production, the government has promulgated various laws prohibiting the transportation of sweet potatoes and other staple foods from Region A to Region B via railway. The authorities also paid attention to the local climate and commissioned various botanists to improve the seeds of wheat, sweet potatoes, and vegetables in order to be suitable for planting in the far north and arid areas.</p>
<p>The important policy of this local self-sufficiency movement, although aimed at alleviating railway transportation congestion (cement, timber, and other building materials have been included in the list of prohibited goods and may not be transported from Siberia to the European part via railway), the fundamental reason is to enable each self-sufficient region to continue to operate and resist after losing contact with other regions during wartime.</p>
<p>Regarding the Soviet Union's plan to economically defend against aggression, Molotov revealed some of its content when reporting the third five-year plan to the 18th Congress of the Communist Party in March 1939, but he did not want to sensationalize, so few people outside paid attention to it at the time.</p>
<p>However, this plan is not without its weaknesses, the main one being that the design and implementation are inconsistent. Time does not allow for the balanced development of each region. The most developed old industrial areas are all adjacent to the aggressor country. Although the authorities have recently used the method of prohibiting the establishment of new industries to prevent the expansion of the Moscow and Leningrad regions, they have not reduced the importance of the two places in terms of national defense and economy.</p>
<p>The Don River basin in western Ukraine is particularly important. The Krivoy Rog iron mine in the area produces more than 16 million tons of iron sand annually, accounting for 59% of the Soviet Union's total iron sand production. The copper and iron factories in the area produce 9 million tons of pig iron and 8.5 million tons of pure steel, exceeding more than half of the Soviet Union's total steel production. The manganese produced in the area accounts for one-third of the Soviet Union's total output. If the area falls, it will be equivalent to losing half of the Soviet Union's industrial output and depriving them of one-quarter of their grain production.</p>
<p>However, even if the Soviet Union loses these two regions, other parts can continue to resist. As far as the three industrial areas in Asia are concerned, the Ural region is the richest and most developed. The Kostniz region has also made great progress, and only the East region is still in its infancy. Each region produces enough grain to be self-sufficient.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's main oil fields are in Baku, located 700 miles southeast of the Don River basin. Baku and the Grozny oil area to its north are shielded by the steep Ural Mountains. It is more difficult for European aggressors to invade from this area than to climb to the sky. The only way is to attack via sea or Turkey. After the British army occupied Syria and the British and Soviet armies made contact in Iran, the Caucasus oil fields are no longer in danger.</p>
<p>Although 90% of the Soviet Union's oil industry comes from the Caucasus, the third five-year plan has opened up a second "Baku" between the Volga and Ural regions, which have the richest oil reserves in the world. Up to now, the area produces 2 million tons of crude oil annually. According to the original plan, it was planned to produce 11 million tons of oil by 1942. Ozick, 160 miles south of Magnitogorsk in the upper reaches of the Ural River, also has various oil refining equipment for large-scale refining.</p>
<p>The Emba oil field and the Ishimbayevo oil field east of the Ural River produce about 1 million tons of oil annually. Siberia also has several oil fields in the Kostniz basin and its east, along Lake Baikal and the Lena River. The Kamchatka Peninsula also produces crude oil. This is only the result of preliminary exploration, and more oil fields may be discovered with continued exploration.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's East region still has oil fields to be developed, only along the Lena River and in the Kucha area. Sakhalin Island produces slightly more oil than pre-war Poland. Unfortunately, half of the oil resources have been leased to Japan.</p>
<p>If Baku falls, the Soviet Union's crude oil problem will encounter serious difficulties, but there are still huge resources that can be used, and if given time, this problem can be solved. On the other hand, the Siberian double-track railway and the railway between Lake Baikal and the Heilongjiang River, which is about to be completed, are expected to solve the transportation problem.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's economic self-sufficiency plan, like other plans, has failed due to insufficient resources, but its partial achievements have given it the possibility of continuing the war.</p>
<p>If Hitler wants to win a complete victory, he must annihilate the entire Red Army and prevent it from conscripting endless manpower to form new armies. But the Soviet people, both men and women, have received military training, and it may be extremely difficult for Hitler to carry out this work.</p>
<p>Soviet civilian national defense organizations have instructed millions of male and female members in the techniques of using rifles and machine guns, as well as air defense methods. There are also many people who have received special military training, such as flying, paratrooping, and guerrilla tactics. Therefore, the broad foundation of Soviet national defense still exceeds the regular army.</p>
<p>Since the era of Genghis Khan's invasion of Russia, every Russian national defense plan has been based on the assumption that a large area of territory will be occupied by foreign invading forces. For six hundred years, Moscow has been invaded by foreign troops almost every century. The Tatars, Lithuanians, Poles, and French have all ravaged Russia. The Russians have always been able to maintain a part of their army, and after recovering their strength and forming a new army elsewhere, they drove the invaders out of the country.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Actively Cultivates Middle School Teachers; Orders Normal Colleges to Establish Junior Divisions to Cultivate Teachers for Junior High Schools and Simplified Normal Schools</h3>
<p>(Chongqing News Agency) Regarding the cultivation of teachers for secondary schools, the Ministry of Education had originally set up seven Normal Colleges. This year, two more Normal Colleges have been added to Sichuan University and the Guiyang Normal College, both of which will be established and start school after the summer vacation. Now, in order to meet the urgent needs of normal schools in various provinces, the Ministry has ordered each Normal College to establish a junior division in accordance with the Normal College Regulations, in order to cultivate teachers for junior high schools and simplified normal schools. Recently, the Ministry of Education's Measures for the Establishment of Junior Divisions in Normal Colleges have been formulated and promulgated, stipulating that the junior divisions of Normal Colleges will have Chinese, History and Geography, Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry courses. The number of students in each course will be determined by the Ministry, and schools will be designated, ordering the Education Bureaus of each province and city to recommend them. In addition to high school graduates and graduates of normal schools or normal subjects in middle schools who have completed their service period, students who have graduated from normal schools or the normal subjects of senior high schools, have served for one year, have excellent grades, and are willing to enter a Normal College may be recommended with the approval of the competent educational administrative authority. The recommendation procedures are that each province and city holds an examination, and in addition to checking the physical condition and oral examination, only the five subjects of Civics, Chinese, Physics and Chemistry, and History and Geography are tested. The English subject will be exempted in order to allow the graduates of normal schools to further their studies. However, those who fail the examination, are physically unsound, or whose oral examination results are not suitable for being teachers shall not be recommended. The travel expenses of each recommended student to the school shall be paid by the province or city that originally recommended them. After arriving at the school, each Normal College shall re-examine the recommended students. The subjects are the same as the recommendation examination. During the student's study period, tuition and board fees are waived, and a public scholarship may be granted at the discretion of the school. After completing three years of study and passing the examination, graduates will be awarded a graduation certificate by the college, and the Ministry of Education will issue a teacher qualification certificate for a certain subject in junior high schools or equivalent schools. The original recommending provincial and municipal educational administrative authorities will assign them for employment. Those who have served for three years, have excellent grades, and are interested in further education may take the insertion examination for the Normal College and insert into the fourth grade of study. However, during the period of study in the junior division, they may not transfer to the undergraduate course of the Normal College. In addition, when the Ministry of Education deems it necessary, it may set up special normal courses in national universities and handle them in accordance with the measures for the junior division. It is heard that the Ministry has designated 16 junior divisions and 2 special normal courses this year, with 40 students in each class, for a total of 720 students. Detailed measures will be published later.</p>

Judging from Wang and Li's recent excellent performance in the China-West tennis celebrity exhibition match at the Racecourse, they overcame Squiers and Bonaventure without much effort. Victory is expected in their first match against the United States today. It is reported that the American team has been weakened this year due to Carson's departure, leaving only Squiers. Therefore, they had to invite Robert Chess, a veteran from twenty years ago who represented the United States in 1921 and 1922 to win the championship, to come out of retirement. Their strength is extremely weak. The winner of the two teams is scheduled to compete with Portugal for the final spot at 3:30 p.m. tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Summer Basketball: Yesterday's Game Had No Result</h3>
<p>In the third act of summer basketball, a small disturbance suddenly occurred in the game between Blue-White and Qianghua. Blue-White disagreed with Zhang Shaoqing's participation in Qianghua because Zhang Shaoqing had participated in the All-Blacks vs. Blue-White game in the summer league. They pointed out that it was against the precedent for the same player to participate in another team in the same competition. After the referee, Mr. Qu Honglu, proposed a compromise, asking Blue-White to reserve the right to protest, so that the game could proceed as usual, but it was not accepted by Blue-White. After a five-minute consideration period and the best efforts of the organizers to mediate, Blue-White insisted on its original intention, and the game could not proceed. The organizers announced that the game would be rescheduled. Yesterday's exhibition game was won by the fellow team over the star team.</p>

<h3>What Fans Should Know About Referees</h3>
<p>— (Chen Linsheng)</p>
<p>The Peizhi Cup charity mini-ball final, Samsung vs. Shunji, was held the other day at the Poverty Children's Education Center. The game was tied, and in overtime, with five minutes left before the end, the sky was already getting dark, and it was difficult to distinguish between people and the ball. At that time, between the right corner of the Shunji goal, due to a goalkeeping foul, the referee Zhang Le blew the whistle and awarded a free kick. Unexpectedly, some spectators who did not understand the rules of the refereeing stormed onto the field and accused the referee. The crowd was in turmoil and the order was disrupted. The game could only be stopped. Referee Zhang Leshan was escorted off the field by Wei Shigeng, Cai Shengsen, Fang Rongfu, Tang Genfu, and others, barely escaping a beating. It can be said that it was extremely dangerous. The author witnessed the situation on the spot and could not help but worry deeply about the future of the sports community. Two tigers fight, and one must be injured. Players compete on the sand with their superior skills. If they lose opportunities due to bad luck, it can be said that although they lost, they still receive honor. Moreover, winning and losing are common in military affairs, and there is nothing to be surprised about. Judging from the refereeing of the game, referee Zhang Le made no mistakes. After the game, Shunji team leader Tao Jinrong also said that there was no mistake. Ultimately, some spectators lacked understanding of the small ball rules and mistakenly believed that Zhang was biased towards Xingxing, so they interfered with the referee's right to enforce the law, violated the spectator's position, and made the cup competition unable to end satisfactorily. It is a regret. Moreover, the occurrence of such an event has a very bad impression. If there are important games in the future, it will make those who are enthusiastic about serving retreat in fear, affecting the progress of the game, which is not insignificant. Moreover, the Yongye Cup final and the Coca-Cola Cup top ten team elimination round are about to be held one after another. If the spectators do not understand the true spirit of sports or the responsibilities of the referees, and the above situation occurs again, it will inevitably hinder the development of small ball. If the referees are intentionally negligent or have the intention of being biased, in addition to voluntarily sacrificing their personality and reputation, we must not only loudly denounce them, but also verbally and in writing criticize them and impose sanctions. The author sincerely hopes that the spectators will strictly abide by the order, not have preconceived notions, and not criticize referees or players due to emotional effects. In particular, do not use winning or losing to determine the joy or anger of watching the game. Only in this way can it be said that one can truly appreciate the skills of the ball.</p>

<h3>Grain: Foreign Rice and Ke Xian Arriving One After Another; Rice Prices Still Struggling to Rise</h3>
<p>After the start of foreign rice trading on Monday, buying and selling were both brisk, with strong demand for both actual sales and speculation. Although prices fell once in the middle, the result was still a rebound of one or two yuan compared to the closing price on Saturday. In the morning, actual sales offices were adding orders, and both futures and spot rice were generally strong. Subsequently, the news spread that foreign rice shipments were continuing to arrive, and that a batch of Wu Xian rice could arrive within the week after the ban was lifted, which immediately lowered market prices. However, large accounts no longer sold, and floating retail investors took the opportunity to absorb, coupled with the difficulty of obtaining foreign exchange, rumors were favorable, and market prices rose with the hearts of the people. For example, the spot price of Xiao Jiao rice opened at 106 yuan in the morning, then fell to 104 yuan, and closed at 107 yuan at noon and 108 yuan in the afternoon. Foreign wharves were also at 107.4 yuan. The final price of spot No. 1 Saigon high-quality goods was 120 yuan, the general market was 118.5 yuan, 118 yuan, Zhongguan rice was 116 yuan, 115.5 yuan, No. 2 rice was 108 yuan, Huo Jiao rice was 116.5 yuan, 115 yuan, No. 2 Siam rice was 1023 yuan, Min Dang high-quality goods were 121 yuan, ordinary goods were 116 yuan to 113 yuan, secondary goods were 110 yuan, bank wharf Xiao Jiao rice was 106.5 yuan, foreign wharf was 105 yuan, broken rice was 90 yuan, and broken tips were high from 81 yuan, secondary to 77 yuan. British-American company Xiao Jiao was 132 yuan, and rice on the road was 133 yuan, broken tips were 93 yuan, and secondary goods were 89 yuan. Approximately 500 tons were traded. Sellers called for prices higher than one yuan, but no agreements were reached. The total number of spot transactions was approximately 25,000 bags.</p>
<p>Foreign rice is continuously arriving in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Poyang Wheel arrived in port the other day (Sunday), carrying 20,000 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload.</p>
<p>Since the adjustment of the thick and thin japonica domestic rice market two mornings ago, yesterday it was again rare, which caused local shops and others to take action to purchase. For a time, sellers were determined to sell, and they shouted hard. As a result, the market rose by one or two yuan. Early rice in Kai Nan Port was 150 yuan, 149 yuan, special japonica rice in Wuxi was 150 yuan, 148 yuan, and new japonica rice in Pudong also rose by two yuan due to the lack of sound and rare sources due to rain. It opened at 152 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice, amid the tightening of foreign rice and the unanimous trend of rising prices of other goods, sporadic appetites were also active, so the market showed a situation of similar supply and demand. Selling prices turned stable without honor or disgrace. It is estimated that special white Hong Kong yuan opened at 124 yuan, high-quality goods were 122 yuan, ordinary goods were 120 yuan, 119 yuan, glutinous lentils were 1112 yuan, secondary to 1089 yuan.</p>
<h3>Vermicelli Fluctuation, Foreign Merchants Peddling Cam Wheat to Replace Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Yesterday vermicelli prices rose and fell, and then rose again. Although market prices fluctuated, the result was still a rise of about half a yuan compared to the end of last week. There were local customers adding orders for actual sales in the morning, and market prices rose with the strong buying as foreign rice rose. Subsequently, the market fell back as foreign rice declined slightly and profitable bulls sold with the market. In the afternoon, it was rumored that Hong Kong vermicelli prices were rising, and foreign exchange was difficult to obtain. Speculative skin ball trading arose at the right time. Those who held goods were also determined not to sell, and the market rose step by step. The price of Golden Dragon brand vermicelli had risen to 31.2 yuan in the early market, fell to 30.08 yuan at noon, and then rose to 31.3 yuan in the afternoon. Dong Wharf was 31.8 yuan, Fortress was from 32.6 yuan to 32.8 yuan in the morning, then fell to 32.3 yuan at the close. The closing price in the afternoon rose to 32.89 yuan, 31.95 yuan, banana was 12.2 yuan, foreign wharf was 32.15 yuan, Australian vermicelli clock tower flower bird was 33.5 yuan, domestic vermicelli was 34 yuan, and 30,000 bags were traded. Bran was in short supply, and small bags were again 33.5 yuan. Wheat sales were rare, and factory prices remained unchanged. However, foreign wheat prices were low, and foreign merchants once peddled Cam No. 3 at 58 yuan, and they could also handle foreign exchange.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Advantageous, Rabbit Up and Falcon Down</h3>
<p>The market for rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil showed a revolving trend yesterday. Upon checking, the market opened in the morning, and prices were seen to rise by one or two yuan due to the enthusiastic entry of many parties. Subsequently, due to poor actual sales, it caused a large number of short sellers to sell, and the market fell sharply again. It was finally sought after by non-industry speculators and recovered slightly. As a result, rapeseed oil fell by 4.5 yuan compared to last week, and cottonseed oil fell slightly by half a yuan. The general market opened with more than 4,000 loads of Qing oil from the Daya Factory for delivery next September. The opening price was 179 yuan, the highest was 181 yuan, the lowest was 175 yuan, and the closing price was 178.5 yuan. In addition, more than 2,000 barrels of rapeseed oil from the Rihua Factory opened at 185.5 yuan, the lowest was 177 yuan, and the closing price was 179.75 yuan. A real sales household on this street bought more than 100 barrels of soybean oil from the Rihua Factory for 110 yuan, 100 barrels of green raw oil for 272 yuan to 275 yuan, and 100 loads of Qing oil from the Daya Factory for 177 yuan. Also, on the 9th, export goods, 70 bags of soybeans, and 900 pieces of soybean cake were transported to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Living on Vegetables and Tofu Still Costs Ten Yuan a Day; Practicing Not Tasting Meat for Three Months; Rent and Daily Necessities All Outside</h3>
<p>The expensiveness of vegetables and food these days is unparalleled, and it is led by oil beans. The expensiveness of oil beans is orchestrated by Dalian Japanese merchants and Shanghai oil merchants. The expensiveness of vegetables is also affected by oil beans, such as tofu and fried tofu, but most of it is due to the harsh levies of bridgehead donation cards and the price increases by vendors, as well as the gradual control of sources and heavy exploitation. According to current prices, it is really not easy to live in a family. Let's calculate roughly as follows, with one yuan as the unit:</p>
<p>Pork 4 taels</p>
<p>Vegetables 1 catty and 4 taels</p>
<p>Soybean oil 7.5 taels</p>
<p>Potatoes 1.5 catties</p>
<p>Old tofu 5 pieces</p>
<p>Large dried mackerel 1 catty</p>
<p>Taro 2 catties</p>
<p>Edamame 1 catty and 4 taels</p>
<p>Alfalfa 12 taels</p>
<p>Celery 5 bundles</p>
<p>Xiao Jiao rice 9 he</p>
<p>Coal balls 6 catties</p>
<p>Large duck eggs 2.5</p>
<p>Tofu skin 20 pieces</p>
<p>According to this calculation, a family of six needs three liters of rice a day, six catties of coal balls, and four taels of oil, plus other side dishes, which costs about ten yuan a day. It is still mostly vegetables and tofu, practicing "not tasting meat for three months."</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Covering Shorts and Cutting Longs Rose Together; Shuangma Was Going Forward in a Zigzag; Futures Yarn Was Even More Powerful</h3>
<p>The yarn market is rising, and the upward trend is becoming more and more intense. This is because competition in the market is gradually increasing, which makes people's hearts active. As a result, short sellers are covering and turning long. As a result, the chips are tighter, and the market is advancing in a zigzag. However, actual transactions are not smooth. Hong Kong merchants only handled a few dozen bales, so some of them closed out many of their positions. The surface is still hard with flatness. Another saying is that the demand from Southeast Asia continues to be good. This is why the price of yarn is firm. The high price of 20s Shuangma was 1,749 yuan, and the low price was 1,735 yuan. The market opened flat in the afternoon, and the price was 1,743 yuan. It was then heard that the price on the exchange was rising, and people's hearts were excited. Buyers came one after another, and the price continued to rise to 1,761 yuan at the close. Currently, the foundation of the yarn market for miscellaneous brands is solid, and the longs are absorbing and holding back. Today, 20 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Xiamen, and 705 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Shuangma Morning: The momentum turned upward due to the active covering of floating shorts. The opening price was 1,738 yuan, and it gradually rose to 1,741 yuan. However, large accounts sold out at a profit, and the price fell back to 1,735 yuan. The opening price on the exchange rose, and the market was bullish. At this price, between 1,743 and 1,744 yuan, for a long time, it rose to 1,749 yuan, and then the short sellers came to sell again, falling back to 1,700 yuan. However, spot yarn transactions were mediocre, and the closing price was 1,745 yuan. The statistics of the amount purchased by each gang are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 10,008</p>
<p>Statistics 8,010</p>
<p>The futures market for Jin Shuangma was soaring, and the trend was exceptionally strong. This is because American cotton is rising, and people's hearts can rely on it to go upward. Moreover, the exchange is stepping up, which makes the longs pull up, so the futures yarn is also shining, and there is also a tendency to rise to the top. When the factory orders were first opened in the morning, the September contract was 1,642 yuan, which rose by 17 yuan, the October contract was 1,661 yuan, the spread was good by 10 yuan, and the November contract was 1,675 yuan, up 7.5 yuan. Afterwards, the fluctuations were uncertain, with a slight downward trend. The noon closing price for near and far contracts rose by 7 to 12 yuan. In the afternoon, the buying was even more intense as each gang strengthened its search, and the factory orders and the exchange continued to rise, which made buyers even more excited. Therefore, the September contract once rose to 1,650 yuan, the October contract rose to 1,673 yuan, and the November contract rose to 1,690.5 yuan. When the market closed, the shape softened, and the September contract closed at 1,640 yuan, the October contract was 1,671.5 yuan, and the November contract was 1,693 yuan, each rising by 15 yuan to 25.5 yuan. Considering the stability of the yarn prices in each market, if there are no special changes in the environment, I am afraid that the futures yarn will continue to rise. The list is shown below.</p>
<h3>Waiting for Foreign Exchange Method: Foreign Cotton Transactions Stalled; 1,500 Pieces of Indian Cotton Arrived</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the first day that the Shanghai port foreign cotton exchange implemented the suppression of the black market for foreign exchange. All Allied banks completely stopped supplying all foreign exchange. Therefore, although all parties were still enthusiastic about ordering foreign cotton, they could only wait for the announcement of concrete measures in the future because they could not obtain U.S. dollars. It depends on whether banks can still have a black market, or directly apply for standard foreign exchange to determine whether to stay or leave. It is expected that the event is very important, and if it is not resolved, it will affect the future of various businesses in Shanghai. Therefore, there may be a clear regulation within two or three days. More cotton has arrived in port. Jardine Matheson's Taisheng Wheel arrived in Shanghai the other day (the 7th), carrying 1,510 pieces of Indian cotton from Hong Kong, and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload. The Indian cotton was transported to Hong Kong by the Karachi, and then transferred to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The current situation of spot cotton is good again. On the one hand, foreign cotton is not loose but tight, and on the other hand, the yarn market is rebounding, which makes people's hearts strong, and the market is recovering.</p>
<p>American Pengan, Singapore 522.0 100 pieces Same industry</p>
<p>Lan 338.0 200 pieces Again</p>
<p>Again 337.0 100 pieces Again</p>
<p>Huoji 190.0 200 bags Again</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Banks Stop Supplying Black Exchange</h3>
<p>Dark Market in a State of Stagnation</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market, the central and HSBC listings were flat, and the U.S. bank's small counters stopped quoting, causing the dark market for British and American exchange to fall into a state of stagnation again. As a result of the Hong Kong stabilization meeting, the 14 banks in this city stopped buying and selling black market exchange for all but legitimate commercial settlements. Chinese speculators could not get started, so the market in the future will be bought and sold by exporters and importers of non-essential goods with a median price. According to a certain Chinese broker, most of the transactions still have to be brokered by brokers to find a counterparty. Foreign trade is actually barter. The market price yesterday was always British gold at two pence eight five nine three seven five, and U.S. dollars at four yuan eight four three seven five. No transactions were heard all day.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Market Stagnant</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 8th (Monday) Electrical Dispatch: The exchange market opened stagnant this morning. Shanghai exchange and Japanese exchange have not yet opened. There is a market without a transaction. The rest also has no ups and downs.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Gang Searched for Cash, Soaring by 150 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was hot, and the futures market initially changed little, trading all day around 6,880 yuan, only 15 yuan high or low, with a transaction volume of about 1,000 taels. This was due to the stable black market for foreign exchange. Cash suddenly turned up sharply. It was the Hong Kong gang who suddenly searched for it. Transactions were quite brisk. Starting in the morning, Xianghe bought from Yongfeng for 10 taels for 9,060 yuan, which was raised by 20 yuan. Then, his father bought 70 taels from Yifeng, and Chengji 10 taels, Fukang Yong 10 taels, for 9,080 yuan. Yifeng sold 30 taels to Xinyuan at the same price. Xianghe bought another 10 taels from Hesheng, and 40 taels from Xiangxing Yong, all at 9,090 yuan. Gonghe and Wanfeng each sold 10 taels to Tianyuan for 9,100 yuan. Xianghe then bought 10 taels from Yifeng, rising to 9,120 yuan. At noon, there were sellers at the above price. In the afternoon, Dingsheng first came to sell, selling slightly to 9,100 yuan, selling 10 taels to Shunyuan for 9,090 yuan. The securities firm Defu suddenly came to sell, and the rising wind rekindled, buying 10 taels from Shunyuan for 9,100 yuan, and another 200 taels from Yifeng, and 50 taels from Xianghe, for 9,120 yuan. Then he bought another 10 taels from Yifeng, and then he bought 20 taels each from Dafeng and Xianghe, and then he sold 50 taels to Decheng, the price of which was 9,130 yuan. Unexpectedly, Defu suddenly came to buy forcefully again, and the rising wind rose again, 20 taels from Huailianxing, for 9,200 yuan, and then bought 10 taels from Xianghe, rising to 9,210 yuan. Later, Xianghe continued to come and sell again, dropping by 50 yuan, selling 10 taels to Chengji for 9,160 yuan, and finally selling 10 taels to Dafeng, for 9,190 yuan, rising by 150 yuan. The high and low on the day were also 150 yuan, with a transaction volume of more than 700 taels. Jewelry gold also hung up 10 yuan, reaching 940 yuan.</p>
<p>Futures Listless</p>
<p>Since the morning, the October contract, each bar (10 taels), opened at 9:15, due to Tianyuan adding sales, which led to a low opening of 5 yuan, at 6,875 yuan. Exchange dealers Dafeng, Ziyuan, Jufeng Yong, Gonghe, etc. successively bought, rising to about 6,885 yuan. At 10:35, it reached 6,890 yuan. Xinfeng Yong sold slightly to 6,885 yuan. Soon it became firm again. At noon, it closed at 6,889 yuan. In the afternoon, there was little supply and demand, and the sellers took the initiative to lower their prices to sell. Therefore, the opening price at 2:00 was 6,878 yuan, 11 yuan lower than the noon closing price. Xinfeng Yong Shihe came to collect and absorb, gradually rising to 6,887 yuan. It was sold by Decheng and Tianyuan. The price fell back. At 3:30, the closing price was 6,880 yuan, which was still the same as the closing price on Saturday.

<h3>Securities: Divergent Movement in Domestic Bonds, Shifting from Class A &amp; B to C &amp; E, Debut of China Cotton Mill Stocks</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter market for government bonds continued to strengthen yesterday. Major players continued to buy, and short sellers slightly covered their positions. The market remained consistently firm, with Class A and B bonds experiencing slight weakness due to some investors selling them. Consequently, investors shifted from Class A and B to Class C and E bonds, leading to a slight abnormal trend. The upward trend reflected strong investor confidence. Tight credit conditions eased, and foreign interbank lending rates decreased. There were no news events favoring short sellers. Yesterday morning, Class C bonds opened at one yuan, rising to one yuan and five fen. This was initially driven by purchases from E-Tye, Jih-Tai, Jien-The, Chung Foo, and Chung-Yi.

Hsieh-Hsing-Yuan slightly increased purchases, and Yun-The added positions. Hung-Ta also made purchases, while E-Tye slightly re-emerged.

<h3>Piece Goods: Further Reduction in Electricity Supply, Cotton Cloth Speculators Re-emerge, Significant Shipments of Piece Goods Southward</h3>
<p>Factory cloth: Yesterday's market trend was firm and rising. Cloth prices rose across the board due to rumors of a further 10% reduction in electricity supply and other positive news. Speculators were eager to buy, and holders took the opportunity to push up prices. As a result, white cloth, coarse and fine cloth, and twill cloth increased by five jiao to seven and a half jiao per piece, while bleached and dyed cloth rose by five jiao to one yuan. Over 600 pieces of various cloths were traded on the street. Guangdong and Hong Kong dealers handled over 200 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Nanyang dealers imported over 100 pieces of bleached cloth, printed cloth, and twill, etc. Dealers from the Zhejiang Eastern (Wenzhou and Taizhou) region handled 50 to 60 pieces of coarse cloth, etc. Today, 24 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Xiamen, and 442 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. Also, last weekend (the 7th), 1,910 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong, and 78 pieces were shipped to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Sundries: Difficulties in Distributing Cigarettes to Outlying Areas, Market Prices Increase Again</h3>
<p>Cigarette Market: Yesterday, buying interest tightened again. The factory's distribution of goods to wholesalers in outlying areas requires prior proof of preparation ("搬出證"), granting them distribution rights. Consequently, everyone believes that future supplies are bound to decrease, causing panic. Holders are driving up prices, and the market is attempting further gains. Big English brand (大英牌) cigarettes traded at 2,330 yuan per case, up 50 yuan from the previous day. Old Knife brand (老刀牌) cigarettes were at 1,170 yuan, Pin Hai brand (品海牌) at 1,660 yuan, Little Fairy brand (小仙女牌) at 1,660 yuan, Five China brand (五華牌) at 1,340 yuan, and the medium-sized box of Ten Big Beauties (十枝大美麗) at 1,300 yuan. Buying prices were uniformly higher and more sought after than the previous day.</p>

<h3>Allied Banks No Longer Engaging in Black Market Operations, Shanghai's Foreign Exchange Black Market Eliminated, Stabilization Fund Cables Order to Cease Listing, Regulations for Supplying Legal Foreign Exchange Promulgated, Exporters' Foreign Exchange Bills Limited to Sale to Fourteen Designated Banks</h3>
<p>Fourteen Allied banks in Shanghai, including Mercantile, HSBC, Citibank, Chase, Chartered, American Express, Tong-Tze-Lung, Netherlands, Anda, Moscow Narodny, and Sassoon (three companies), having been ordered by the Stabilization Fund on September 6th to supply foreign exchange for essential imports at newly regulated prices, received another cable order yesterday from the U.S. Embassy's Stabilization Fund Committee to uniformly cease listing black market exchange rates. Therefore, the Shanghai foreign exchange black market, which the authorities were determined to eliminate, abruptly disappeared yesterday morning due to the cooperation of the banks. These fourteen Allied banks, operating under the asset freeze orders from the UK, US, and Netherlands affecting Japanese and Chinese funds, agreed to the Stabilization Fund's measures and will no longer engage directly or indirectly in black market transactions. Yesterday's exchange rates quoted by these banks were the preferential rates stipulated by the Stabilization Fund, less the banks' commission. This amounted to US$5.165 yuan, or US$5.3125 yuan, and 18.82 yuan per US dollar, with British Pounds at three pence and one five six two five.</p>
<p>Two Governments Urge Cooperation</p>
<p>According to authoritative sources in the banking sector, the cessation of black market trading by foreign banks in Shanghai yesterday was the result of formal advice from the British and American governments to their respective banks in the Far East to fully cooperate with the Stabilization Fund Committee. When the asset freeze orders were first issued, some foreign banks in Shanghai, holding special licenses, continued to engage in black market foreign exchange trading, leading to the persistence of black market speculative activities. This announcement of the cessation of black market trading will eliminate overt speculation. Foreign exchange for legitimate import trade can be obtained from designated banks, who will apply to the Stabilization Fund Committee on behalf of importers and supply it at the new exchange rate. Goods prohibited from import, unable to secure the necessary foreign exchange, may face complete cessation. This measure will naturally help to adjust Shanghai's trade deficit.</p>
<p>Goods for Foreign Exchange Settlement Classified into Two Categories</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Stabilization Fund notified the fourteen Shanghai banks holding foreign exchange business licenses that the Fund would supply the Shanghai foreign exchange market at regulated prices to maintain large-scale legitimate import trade. Goods eligible for this low-priced foreign exchange are divided into two categories. Category A includes food grains purchased by the Shanghai Municipal Council, mineral oil products such as gasoline, tobacco leaves, and coal. Category B includes a wide range of goods, some of which were listed on the 1939 list of prohibited imports. The most important items in Category B are cotton, ramie, electrical and power generation machinery, other machinery, canned food, flour, wheat, chemicals, medicines, indigo dyes, newsprint, leather, rubber, automobiles, wheels, rubber tires, photographic and film materials, and others. Among the above-mentioned Category A and B goods, gasoline, tobacco leaves, ramie, and canned food were all on the 1939 prohibited import list published by Customs. The Stabilization Fund's approval of their import and supply of preferential foreign exchange is likely due to consideration of market needs. Similarly, while automobiles, wheels, rubber tires, photographic and film materials are not on the list of goods approved for import by the Executive Yuan, the Stabilization Fund's inclusion of them in the category of goods for which foreign exchange settlement is required serves the same purpose.</p>
<p>Monthly Limits on Foreign Exchange Supply</p>
<p>The Stabilization Fund will approve the supply of preferential British pounds or US dollars for the above-mentioned Categories A and B goods, but the amount supplied is not unlimited and will be allocated on a quota basis. The Stabilization Fund will set a monthly foreign exchange settlement quota for each approved import item, and will refuse to supply foreign exchange beyond that quota. For example, if the monthly foreign exchange settlement quota for food grains is set at one million US dollars, all importers applying for foreign exchange for food grains will be allocated a share of this amount. Once the total quota has been exhausted, the supply will be suspended. This indicates that the Stabilization Fund may not approve import merchants' applications for foreign exchange in full, but will determine the amount based on the stipulated quota. Importers wishing to apply to the Stabilization Fund for foreign exchange must first complete the shipping arrangements and export procedures in the country of origin of the goods, and then prepare the equivalent value in legal tender to apply to the Stabilization Fund for the required foreign exchange. The supply of funds is not contingent on prior approval, but rather on the completion of all procedures. The Stabilization Fund may also approve the supply of foreign exchange for insurance and shipping costs, calculated in foreign currency, related to imported goods.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Settlement Also Approved for Small-Scale Trade</p>
<p>For imported goods not included in the above-mentioned Categories A and B, and whose scope is smaller, with a total monthly value not exceeding US$2,000, the Stabilization Fund Committee may supply the required foreign exchange at its discretion, considering the actual situation. However, this must first be approved by the Chinese government. For personal needs, such as overseas remittances for insurance premiums, the Stabilization Fund will also approve foreign exchange as long as the total amount does not exceed US$200 per person per month. Regarding foreign exchange expenses for Chinese students studying abroad, according to the regulations of the Executive Yuan, during the war period, publicly funded students not approved for dispatch will be temporarily suspended. Privately funded students who have scholarships or other foreign exchange subsidies sufficient to cover all expenses during their studies and do not need to purchase foreign exchange will be temporarily suspended from going abroad. Publicly funded students already abroad, if studying sciences related to national defense, will have their tuition, living expenses, and travel expenses covered by foreign exchange, but this must be verified by the Ministry of Education. Students ordered to return to China who fail to do so within the stipulated time will no longer receive foreign exchange notices. All foreign exchange payments to overseas students will be purchased by the Ministry of Education from the Stabilization Fund, with the approval of the Ministry of Finance. All fourteen Allied banks have stated their willingness to comply with the regulations of the Stabilization Fund to ensure that foreign exchange settlement procedures are standardized. If the Stabilization Fund approves the foreign exchange, but the bank finds the original application inconsistent with regulations, the bank handling the transaction must be responsible for repaying the supplied foreign exchange to the Stabilization Fund.</p>
<p>Export Bills Not Allowed for Open Sale</p>
<p>On the other hand, the issue of export foreign exchange settlement has long been a matter of urgency for the Stabilization Fund authorities. In the current situation in Shanghai, export settlements cannot be handled by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. As a result, exporters freely sell their foreign exchange earnings on the black market, contributing to the difficulty of eliminating the black market. Recognizing this, the authorities have decided that when goods are transshipped from other ports for export from Shanghai, the foreign exchange must be settled at the original port of export. However, for local Shanghai goods exported directly, there has been no way to resolve this. Now, the Stabilization Fund Committee, with the cooperation of the relevant banks, has found a solution. Shanghai merchants who obtain foreign exchange from the Stabilization Fund for imports must sell the foreign exchange earned from their exports to any one of the fourteen banks at the Stabilization Fund's price. If they sell it elsewhere (or on the black market), the Stabilization Fund will stop supplying that merchant with new foreign exchange for import trade as a penalty, whether the application is direct or indirect. However, this does not apply to native goods transshipped through Shanghai for export that have already been settled at the original port of export. The Stabilization Fund's measure regarding export foreign exchange settlement is clearly aimed at preventing exporters from selling their foreign exchange earnings on the black market, which fuels its proliferation. If export settlements are entirely controlled by the fourteen banks, and sellers on the black market disappear, the import trade of non-essential goods, which relies on selling foreign exchange on the black market for its survival, will suffer a severe blow.</p>
<p>Four Banks Have Not Yet Received Orders</p>
<p>According to a reliable source contacted by the New Life News Agency yesterday, the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, and Central Trust of China had not yet received orders from their head offices regarding foreign exchange settlements for essential goods and the cessation of black market trading. However, regardless, the four banks will take the same steps as the other fourteen Allied banks to complete the Stabilization Fund Committee's mission of maintaining legitimate trade and eliminating black market speculation. It is understood that the orders for the four banks will arrive within days and will be implemented immediately upon arrival. As for the application forms for banks to clear foreign exchange on behalf of customers with the Stabilization Fund, the content has been seen in previous reports. Relevant banks are currently rushing to print large quantities of these forms and will distribute them to import merchants so they can apply for essential foreign exchange according to the Stabilization Fund's regulations. These application forms should be printed by tomorrow.</p>
<p>Black Market Had No Basis Yesterday</p>
<p>According to market sources, the black market foreign exchange had no trading activity yesterday because foreign banks had ceased trading, and the phenomenon was that of a market without trades. Bank selling prices consistently remained steady at 2.859375 pence and 4.84375 yuan. The above prices were the same as last Saturday's. The morning close was unchanged, and there was no change at the afternoon opening. Consequently, the gold market was unusually sluggish, and prices were stagnant. This cannot be resolved until there is a suitable solution for the black market foreign exchange. The recently adopted method by the gold futures black market of settling futures gold prices based on commercial exchange rates and implied black market exchange rates has also suffered a severe blow.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council's Fuel Committee Conducting Fuel Negotiations, Possible Slight Fluctuations in Coal Prices This Winter, No Need to Panic if There Are No Speculators Manipulating the Market</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Fuel Committee is constantly discussing with the Japanese side to increase the amount of fuel imported into Shanghai. At the same time, the police authorities are also working to prevent general coal merchants from monopolizing and hoarding. According to importers of coal into Shanghai, the arrival of coal in Shanghai has not decreased. The main reasons for the high coal prices are the current war, the tense situation in the Pacific, and the anxiety caused by speculators.</p>
<p>Electricity Conservation Measures Still Need Improvement</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai coal industry is not subject to control, general coal merchants can easily hoard coal in Pudong and other places to wait for a good price. The Shanghai Municipal Council has not been able to control the selling price of coal but is trying its best to alleviate the coal problem. Those hoarding coal are mostly general merchants and factories. The Shanghai Power Company is currently being supplied with 25,000 tons of coal per month by a certain factory but hopes to increase this by another 25,000 tons to improve the electricity conservation problem.</p>
<p>Coal Negotiations Gradually Becoming Smoother</p>
<p>The negotiations between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Power Company with foreign merchants are expected to gradually become smoother in the future, but the date of realization is unknown. In short, although there may be very slight fluctuations in coal prices in Shanghai this winter, the people of Shanghai do not need to panic. Coal prices will rise and fall with the situation, just like ordinary commodities. It will be difficult to normalize coal prices until the overall situation improves. The Shanghai Municipal Council and its Fuel Subcommittee are currently doing their best to reduce the difficulties of coal users this winter and expect to decide on a suitable solution soon. It is hoped that all sectors will report any coal merchants hoarding for profit to the Shanghai Municipal Council for sanctions.</p>
<h3>Today is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Memorial Day, Launching a Drive to Collect Winter Clothing, Promoting Frugality and Savings Deposits</h3>
<p>Today is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Memorial Day, commemorating Dr. Sun Yat-sen's initial decision to launch an uprising, as well as the combined anniversaries of his capture in London and Guangzhou. All sectors remember Dr. Sun Yat-sen's creation of the Republic of China, overthrow of the imperial system, and his great revolutionary achievements, and unanimously commemorate in silence. In view of the imminent arrival of winter, they have decided to launch a drive to collect winter clothing to benefit refugees. At the same time, they will continue to promote the movement of frugality and savings deposits to save material resources.</p>
<h3>Former Philippine Congressman Visiting Shanghai, Studying Trade with China, This Trip is Highly Important</h3>
<p>Former Philippine Congressman Eleuterio Frivaldo and his brother Vicente Frivaldo (Vicente is the Manager of the Philippine President's Far East Industries Company) have come to Shanghai by boat to understand the Chinese commercial and trade situation. They will stay in Shanghai for a short time and then travel to Kunming, Guiyang, Chongqing, and other places in the interior of China via Hong Kong to strengthen trade organizations with China. As China and the Philippines are improving diplomatic relations, the Frivaldo brothers' visit to Shanghai is highly important.</p>
<h3>Manager of Fuyuan Money Shop, Ma Yuelou, Reported Kidnapped Yesterday, Abducted on Gansu Road Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, another kidnapping case occurred in the International Settlement. The victim was Ma Yuelou, a shareholder and manager of Fuyuan Money Shop, from Zhenjiang, aged 53. He is currently a shareholder and manager of Fuyuan Money Shop in Ruyi Lane, Henan Road, and resides at No. 27 Rehe Road in Shanghai. His wife is deceased, and his son, Jiaqin (33 years old), is employed in the clearing department of the Shanghai Bank on Ningbo Road. Ma usually has his own private car, driven by Xu A'san from Taixian. Yesterday morning, at around 9:00 a.m., Ma left home in his private car. Unexpectedly, when the car reached the intersection of Gansu Road and Rue Albert, three kidnappers suddenly jumped out from the roadside. Two were wearing Western suits, and one was wearing Chinese clothing. They stopped the car with guns, dragged Ma out of the car, and forced him into a small black-plated car that was parked by the side of the road. The car drove away without a trace. Afterwards, Xu A'san reported the situation to the police. The Hongkou Hui-Shi police station received the report and immediately dispatched detectives to investigate and ordered a search for Ma's whereabouts. However, as of the press deadline, there was still no news. One theory is that the kidnappers came in a car and stopped the car when it encountered Ma's car to carry out the kidnapping. Because the driver, Xu A'san, was terrified, he could not clearly identify the license plate number of the car.</p>
<h3>Boiled Water Industry Demands Water Fee Reduction, Petitioned Yesterday to the Two Water Companies, Instructed to Negotiate with Authorities</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Boiled Water Industry Association, in order to reduce the burden on its members, requested the British and French water companies to reduce water fees or change the calculation method. Yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m., it appointed Zhang Delong, Ji Jianming, Ye Hanjun, Shi Xingli, Qiu Tingsen, Su Zhixiang, Jin Linsheng, and Han Jingquan to deliver a letter to the British Water Company, requesting that they consider the livelihood of ordinary people and social security and approve a reduction in water fees to reduce the cost of the industry. In the afternoon at 2:00 p.m., the committee members also took a letter to the French Water Company with the same request. The results were satisfactory. The two water companies sent representatives to meet with them and instructed the representatives to negotiate with the authorities of the two settlements. If the two authorities approve a reduction in fees, the two companies will abide by the authorities' orders. They also expressed that they were well aware of the relationship between boiled water shops and ordinary people. Now, the Boiled Water Shop Association has decided to follow the established plan and appeal to the two authorities for assistance to quickly change the calculation method, provide a fixed amount of water per month at a fixed price, or specially approve an exemption from additional fees, or calculate the price of water for the boiled water industry on an equal basis with the price of water for household users.</p>
<h3>More Than 200 Vietnamese Soldiers Arrive in Shanghai to Increase Defense, Arrived and Landed on the Bena Saint-Quentin Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency learned yesterday from reliable sources that 274 Vietnamese soldiers from French Indochina arrived in Shanghai on the French Shipping Company's Bena Saint-Quentin at 8:00 a.m. yesterday. The ship docked at Wharf 11 and 12 on the Huangpu River and then took the company's small ferry across the river to the Customs wharf to disembark. It is believed that the Vietnamese soldiers came to Shanghai to strengthen the defense in the French Concession.</p>
<h3>Gu'aotou Approved for Navigation, Limited to Registered Ships, Shipping Companies Preparing to Join Service</h3>
<p>The Gu'aotou shipping route in eastern Zhejiang Province, after the British company Da Li Wheel took the lead in the trial voyage, was followed by the American company Da Xin Wheel. The latter ship ran aground in the Zhoushan waters due to a hurricane, resulting in an incomplete voyage. According to shipping industry news yesterday, since the important ports of Zhejiang Province have either fallen or been ordered to be blockaded, the Shanghai-Zhejiang shipping route has been interrupted for several months. Freight transport cannot be smoothed out, and there is an extreme lack of various necessities in the interior. Since Aojiang Port is not on the blockade list, and in order to meet the current needs and allow a portion of the necessities to flow into the interior, foreign ships have been approved to transport goods to Gu'aotou. However, incoming and outgoing ships are limited to those that were previously registered with the Wenzhou authorities. All cargo must be inspected at designated locations. Currently, shipping companies in Shanghai are preparing to join the service. However, the Jianghai Customs has not yet lifted the ban on customs clearance for the route, and shipping companies are trying to dredge the situation in order to be successful.</p>

<h3>Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund: Industry and Commerce Group Successfully Concluded - Understanding the Principles of Respect for Work and Enjoyment of Profession - Proficiency Comes from Diligence, Not Neglect</h3>
<p>Since the 22nd of August, after our newspaper successfully completed the student scholarship program, we continued to run the supplementary education scholarship program for industrial and commercial employees. Over the past 17 days, we have now fully completed all procedures, including registering, investigating, reviewing, announcing, and issuing scholarships to over a thousand applicants. Our colleagues, mindful of the great trust placed in us by the gentlemen and ladies who donated to the readers' scholarship fund, have been constantly striving to live up to their expectations, hoping not to betray the original intention and enthusiasm of the readers who contributed. Now, on the day of announcing the approved list and concluding the program, we would like to say a few words to the industrial and commercial employees who received the scholarships, and also seek correction from all sectors of society.</p>
<p>You are engaged in the industrial and commercial sectors, which are the cornerstone of the social and economic fortress. Supplementing knowledge and studying technology are essential for industrial and commercial employees today. However, there must be a clear understanding, namely "respect for work and enjoyment of profession." Your diligent pursuit of knowledge should aim at developing your own profession. Proficiency comes from diligence, while neglect leads to failure. Your ability to put aside the current indulgence in feasting and drinking and engage in active learning sets a good example and will surely sow good seeds for the future of industry and commerce. If this can be promoted and carried forward to reverse the current decline, the readers who donated will be able to fulfill their long-cherished wishes, and the firms where you work will also benefit from increased service efficiency. Benefiting oneself and benefiting others, helping oneself and being helped by others, you will not only be worthy of the enthusiastic assistance of society, but also have done your utmost for society and your profession.</p>
<p>Furthermore, supplementary education in spare time is originally a matter of each individual's active pursuit of knowledge. Many of you may have faced difficulties in your early years of study, but throughout history, saints, sages, and heroes have all come from adversity. Your ability to encourage yourselves today will surely lead you to deeply believe that the hardships you have endured are the inevitable path to future success. The more difficult, the more training; the more hardship, the more struggle. As the saying goes, "Only those who persevere can succeed," and "Constant dripping wears away the stone." We sincerely hope that you will persevere throughout the course of your supplementary studies. The day you complete your studies will also be the time when we can report to society with satisfaction.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the "Spring and Autumn" column of this newspaper, an anonymous old man respectfully addressed the students selected for the scholarship, saying, "Studying hard under the moonlight, without warm clothing in winter, running a book stall for twenty years, with meager surpluses, all used to run charities." The old man also generously donated two thousand yuan to our newspaper's scholarship program. Seeing the old man's sincere encouragement, you should know that the scholarship opportunity you have received today, every single bit of it, is given by the noble and invaluable enthusiasm of people from all walks of life. We hope that you will uphold this spirit, constantly strive for self-improvement, and repay the great kindness of all sectors of society in supporting education. Written in haste, we sincerely express our gratitude and extend our deepest thanks to all enthusiastic supporters of education.</p>
<h3>Japanese Nationals Evacuated from the Philippines Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning - A Total of 340 People</h3>
<p>The French postal steamer "Bana Saint Therapia" arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 a.m. yesterday after sailing from Manila and docked at Pujiang Floating Pontoon Numbers 11 and 12. In addition to carrying 2,500 tons of coal, the ship also carried 340 Japanese nationals who had been residing in various parts of Southeast Asia and had gathered in the Philippines to evacuate to Shanghai. This group of Japanese nationals disembarked at the Customs Wharf at 9:30 a.m. yesterday. It is estimated that they will stay in Shanghai for several days before returning to Japan by ship. It is reported that these Japanese nationals have been affected by the freezing of funds by the United States and the United Kingdom, which has forced the closure of their shops in various parts of Southeast Asia. It is said that a larger number of businessmen and industrialists will be evacuated to Shanghai and then return to Japan.</p>
<h3>Rumor of President Lines Moving to the Philippines Denied - Company Employees Going to the Philippines are Personnel Transfers</h3>
<p>The rumor spread by the Japanese Domei News Agency that the Shanghai Eastern General Office of the American President Lines would be moved to Manila, leaving only a small number of essential staff in Shanghai to handle business, has been denied by an employee of the company. According to him, the recent departure of American President Lines employees from Shanghai to Manila on the President Garfield was only a temporary assignment. The Manila office lacked personnel, so the company management found it appropriate to send some employees to assist in the office. Once their task is completed, they will return to work in Shanghai. According to a Domei News Agency dispatch from Manila, the American President Lines has decided to move its Eastern General Office from Shanghai to Manila, and several employees of the Shanghai General Office have already arrived in Manila.</p>
<h3>Dispute at the Huishan Police Station the Day Before Yesterday - A Misunderstanding</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reported that a Western police officer from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department had a dispute with a Japanese person at the Huishan Police Station late last night (the 7th). It is understood that the matter arose from a misunderstanding. The appearance of several Japanese Navy Marine Corps soldiers in the police station led to speculation among the Chinese. However, the police claimed that it was common for Japanese people other than Japanese police officers to come to the police station. It is said that the Japanese soldiers soon left the Huishan Police Station. It was later confirmed that the Western police officer involved in the dispute had been taken away from the police station by the Japanese. It is said that the superintendent in charge of the Huishan district, Barre, and a senior police officer, both went to the Huishan Police Station to inquire about the matter.</p>
<h3>Mexican Chargé d'Affaires Inspects U.S. Marines</h3>
<p>According to the "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," the 4th Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai will conduct exercises at Jiaozhou Road Park at 8:00 a.m. on Thursday. The Mexican Chargé d'Affaires, Mr. Prieto, will attend the inspection as a guest of honor of the regiment's commander, Colonel Howard.</p>

The overall account will be published later.</p>

<h3>Old Couple Divorces, Daughter Commits Suicide - Old Woman Has Affair, Daughter Dies of Shame</h3>
<p>Zhao Jingzhai, also known as Zhao Desheng, a native of Linhai, Zhejiang, is 61 years old. He used to work at Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. He married a Cantonese woman, Ms. Ding (49 years old this year), many years ago, and they have several children. They currently reside in a pavilion room on the second floor of the Mintian Rice Shop at No. 9 Malong Road in the French Concession. Their eldest daughter, Biyu, is 21 years old and is studying obstetrics at the Tongde Medical College on Tongfu Road.</p>
<p>Zhao's wife, Ms. Ding,</p>
<p>Although old, is still very flirtatious. Not content at home, she has an affair with the owner of the rice shop. Recently, Zhao discovered this and there was a major dispute. The couple even decided to divorce. The eldest daughter, Biyu, bitterly advised her mother, but she would not listen. Zhao and his wife agreed on the divorce terms: Ms. Ding would compensate Zhao for 1,000 yuan in losses, and all children would be raised and married by Zhao. Both parties then signed a</p>
<p>Divorce Agreement</p>
<p>on the afternoon of the 7th at a lawyer's office.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the children should follow their father. The eldest daughter, Biyu, went home to pack her clothes, intending to go to her father's. Ms. Ding tried to persuade Biyu to stay with her, but the daughter insisted on not doing so. Mother and daughter had a fierce quarrel. At this point, the daughter had a suicidal thought and immediately took poison. By the time her mother discovered this, it was too late to save her, and she died. After the incident, Zhao and Ms. Ding reported to the police, saying that</p>
<p>Their daughter, Biyu,</p>
<p>had failed her studies and was held back a grade, and had committed suicide out of resentment. The police sent investigators to investigate, but the accounts varied. They then summoned the deceased's parents and the rice shop owner to the police station for questioning and took the body to the coroner's office. Yesterday, the deceased's father, Zhao Jingzhai, claimed the body for burial.</p>
<h3>Woman Takes Poison and Jumps into the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>At around 10:30 p.m. last night, a fashionable woman named Huang Zhen, 32 years old, from Jiangsu, jumped into the Huangpu River at the Bund Park. It is not known why she had thoughts of death. She first drank a large dose of poison, and then jumped into the river to kill herself. Fortunately, Patrolman No. 9090 of the Central Police Station managed to rescue her and take her to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, she had lost consciousness and her life was in danger.</p>
<h3>Cheng Ji Watercolor Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Cheng Ji Watercolor Exhibition, which opened on September 1st, has lasted for over a week. Viewers have praised it highly. The exhibits are mostly urban landscapes and social dynamics of Shanghai. Many works are masterpieces, and most have been purchased by knowledgeable people. It is a grand occasion rarely seen since the Western porcelain exhibitions of recent years. Works such as No. 3 "Road Builder," No. 77 "Street Cleaner," No. 58 "Ship," No. 11 "International Hotel," and No. 5 "Jiangxi Road" have been highly appreciated by Western visitors. Masterpieces such as "Golden Flower," which is light and refined, and "Red Apricot Branch Head Spring Full of Life," which is deeply satirical, are thought-provoking. The exquisite and innovative decoration of each piece is also noteworthy. It is said that the exhibition will end on the 10th, with only today and tomorrow remaining.</p>
<h3>Lockdown at Chengdu Road Intersection Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>At 10 a.m. yesterday morning, a lockdown was suddenly implemented by the police department at the intersection of Fuxu Road and Chengdu Road, at the boundary between the two concessions. Barbed wire fences were erected in the center of the road, and more than 20 armed Chinese and Western detectives were stationed on both sides, selectively searching pedestrians and vehicles that seemed suspicious. The lockdown was lifted at 10:20 a.m. The detailed reasons are unknown.</p>
<h3>Publishing News</h3>

<p>The fourth issue of the "Mainland" monthly magazine has been published. The magazine is a comprehensive magazine with knowledge and interest. The content includes international new knowledge, travel essays, local impressions, professional life, social aspects, historical essays, daily science, medical knowledge, and long novels. It is worth reading.</p>

<h3>Absorption of Spiritual Food</h3>
<p>— Wu Dai</p>
<p>Spiritual food is very important, but after all, physical food is more fundamental. To put it bluntly, in this era of rising living standards, one can choose not to look at calligraphy and painting, but one cannot choose not to eat. This is undoubtedly an irrefutable truth, but conversely, those who are full are not necessarily aware of the meaning of spiritual food, because everyone is born to be hungry, but the appreciation of spiritual food needs to be educated step by step.</p>
<p>From primitive times to the present, from eating raw food to cooked food, it can be said that the only great progress in human physical food, and looking forward, there does not seem to be any more remarkable developments. However, it is not the case with spiritual food. The invention of writing allowed abstract thoughts to have a permanent record, which can be said to be the beginning of human civilization. Gutenberg's invention of the printing press provided an opportunity for the mass dissemination of writing, and also created a new era for the cultural world. These two major events in the cultural history of spiritual food have promoted the accelerated progress and development of human society. It can be seen that spiritual food occupies an important position in historical evolution.</p>
<p>Food is the first necessity of the people, and no one can oppose this statement. As for refined spiritual food, we believe that at least thought should prioritize spiritual food. In today's civilized society, those who wish to be full all day long and become walking corpses are said to be extremely rare. Unfortunately, however, spiritual food is not something that everyone is born to be able to eat. This requires education and promotion to make the absorption of spiritual food a habit.</p>
<p>Naturally</p>
<h3>Spider Tactics</h3>
<p>— Nong Jian</p>
<p>The "spider," that gray-brown and filthy little creature, whenever we see it, we always feel a bit disgusted, right? But you wouldn't imagine how clever and skillful their tactics are! Now, regardless of whether their tactics are old-fashioned or seem modern, I will briefly describe them here.</p>
<p>Building Bridges</p>
<p>Building bridges is the precursor to marching, so I've included this item as well. How exactly does a spider cross a stream to build its web, or is it just to wave to the other shore? Thomson says, "It stands on a high branch, releases a long strand of silk, letting it drift with the wind until it reaches the bushes on the other side. When the spider feels that the silk sac is no longer being pulled, it stops releasing silk; it tightens the strand, making it straight, and firmly ties the end closest to it onto the branch..." - This reminds me of the method used by the Congo natives to build "vine bridges" in the film "Mysterious Congo" that I saw: using an extremely long vine rope tied to the top of a tall tree on one bank, and then sending the person tied to the rope, like swinging on a swing, to the opposite bank of the stream, thus laying the first foundation rope of the vine bridge. Isn't this the same as the spider's actions?</p>
<p>Setting Traps</p>
<p>Some spiders can densely weave a layer of web in the gaps of walls or depressions in the ground, making it form the same plane as the wall or the ground: unaware and forced insects accidentally crawl over it and are firmly caught by the mucus or ropes on the web. The "Wubei Zhi" compiled by Mao Yuanyi of the Ming Dynasty states the following regarding "Pitfall Traps": "Dig a pit in the soil, five feet long, three or four feet wide and deep...Cover it with hay or plant seedlings, so that the enemy is completely unaware..." I think this kind of plan is no different from the spider's wisdom.</p>
<p>Air Defense</p>
<p>Speaking of air defense, we humans should truly feel ashamed and sigh that we are far inferior to spiders! Look at the various and colorful webs that spiders weave! Horizontal, vertical, inclined, square, round, triangular; in the corners of walls, on flower branches, eaves, windows, visible everywhere. What bold mosquitoes and flies dare to fly recklessly without being immediately unlucky and firmly captured? - I believe that humans take inspiration from spiders when they create nets to ambush birds and beasts in forests and thickets; can't we one day scatter thousands and hundreds of iron nets in the sky above large cities to block or capture invading enemy planes?</p>
<p>Submerging</p>
<p>Thomson also said that there is a type of spider that can make an airtight net in the water, filling it with dry air, and then swim freely, like a "diving bell." - Unexpectedly, small-scale submarines can also be found in this humble animal!</p>
<p>Shooting</p>
<p>There is a unique spider in Australia called the "Magnificent Spider." It likes to eat moths but does not spin webs; it spins a long line with a drop of extremely sticky substance attached to the end; it uses a front leg to suspend the line - "as if using a fishing rod to suspend the line" - when a moth passes by, it quickly swings the line; the glue drop is extremely sticky, and once a moth touches it, it cannot escape. Moreover, its skill is extremely high, sometimes capturing the moth with one or two swings: - There is a similar spider in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, but its long line spins non-stop. - This can truly be called a sharpshooter.</p>
<p>Scoop Catching</p>
<p>Thomson also said: In Argentina, there is a type of spider that can build a funnel-shaped net by the shallow water; it can drive tadpoles into its net, and then take them for food. - I think this is very similar to the cast nets used by fishermen, and it cannot be said that it is not a special tactic of the spider.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>12. Unexpected Turmoil</p>
<p>That night, he and Begonia discussed the matter for the entire night because he was more familiar with the roads in the city than she was. They decided that he would follow Chen Da into the city to investigate carefully.</p>
<p>"You can't bring too little money!" When he was about to leave, Begonia gave him twenty dollars, but he insisted on only taking five. Begonia automatically stuffed the rest into his pocket. "Little Gouzi, I know your loyalty! But as the saying goes, nothing in the world can be done without money. You should still take it with you! As long as we can find the young lady sooner, I'm willing to spend more money."</p>
<p>Little Gouzi blushed and hid the four banknotes.</p>
<p>"Don't worry! Sir, if I, Little Gouzi, can't find the young lady, I won't see you again in this lifetime!" He tightened the cloth belt around his waist, stood in the cold wind, his body as straight as a bamboo pole, his face without a smile, his sleeves rolled up high, constantly glancing at the Meng family shop across the street, looking as if he was about to fight the Meng family shop owner.</p>
<p>"Fortunately, a letter has also been sent from the school to the county. Maybe they've already come back," Chen Da said to Begonia with sympathy. "Mr. He should wait for our news at home!"</p>
<p>Begonia forced a smile and nodded to him. (206)</p>
<h3>"Clearance Sale"</h3>
<p>— Feile</p>
<p>In New York, there are at least twenty large department stores that hold an "inventory clearance sale" every year. The time is usually three weeks, but it can be shortened to one week if the inventory is cleared. The price reduction is very thorough, substantial, and can even be lower than the cost by more than 25 percent, so most discerning customers flock to it.</p>
<p>The department store owner said: "Clearing inventory can keep a business from falling behind the times."</p>
<p>Indeed, "inventory" and "outdated" are equal, just as two plus two equals four. To avoid being "outdated," you must clear your "inventory."</p>
<p>Today, people's minds need this "clearance"!</p>
<p>Do you feel your head is swelling? Maybe there's too much inventory! I tell you, inventory is what keeps you away from the times, rejecting so many new things. It makes you more and more pedantic, closer and closer to the antique showcase, unless you decide to "clear" it. If every year, every mind could have a "clearance sale," I think the world would be filled with freshness and joy! Not only that, but perhaps the giant wheel of the times would have already advanced to another stage.</p>

<h3>An Old Man in England</h3>
<p>— Wang Liang</p>
<p>On a train in Berlin filled with soldiers going to the front lines, stood a hunched old woman, seeing her son off. During the farewell, tears streamed down her wrinkled face; the crowd around her insulted her. Unexpectedly, she solemnly said: "I sent my husband and sons to the battlefield one by one; they sacrificed themselves for the country one by one. Now I am sending off my last son, and I will have no more sons to fight for the country. This makes me even more heartbroken!"</p>
<p>This is a very touching story. The old woman, the protagonist of the story, is certainly immortal, but now she probably cannot claim the exclusive privilege:</p>
<p>In a factory in central England, there is a 75-year-old man operating a heavy press, without anyone's help, and the machine lacks protective devices; it is clearly too dangerous. An inspector, greatly surprised, approached and inquired; he answered in a heavy tone: "That doesn't matter. Installing protective devices would hinder the work; without them, the work can be at least three times faster. My son is now serving in Libya (east of Egypt). He is risking his life; I am only risking my fingers!" At least this old man's request to God seems more active, I think.</p>
<p>War</p>
<h3>Fearless Firefighters</h3>
<p>— Kezhong</p>
<p>Under the intense bombing of German planes, the work of London firefighters can be said to be one of the most dangerous in the world. In order to do their job better, these fearless firefighters spare no expense, spending a lot of money and time, engaging in large-scale, long-term hard training. During training, they wear gas masks and rush into houses filled with smoke, both to get used to that stifling environment and to test whether their gas masks are damaged. Their spirit of struggling without fear of difficulties and avoiding trouble is entirely for a greater goal: to save the country from the threat of totalitarianism.</p>

<h3>Jiang Hong, Burying Herself in Diligent Study</h3>
<p>— Weiren</p>
<p>I have met Jiang Hong, who plays the Empress Dowager Cixi in "Qing Palace Grievances," several times. We talked about some fragmented issues related to drama. She is very articulate and very amiable. What is recorded in this article is a process of her struggling in acting, that is, a report of her artistic training.</p>
<p>Jiang Hong is nineteen years old this year and is from Suzhou. She grew up in Beiping. Her parents are both alive, and she has an older brother, a younger brother, and a younger sister. In her childhood, she followed her father, running north and south, and had been to many places. She lived in the Henan area for a relatively long time. After the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident occurred, she came to Shanghai with her mother, brother, younger brother, and younger sister, leaving her father alone working in the Ministry of Railways in Chongqing.</p>
<p>She first studied at Qixiu, and later was admitted to Guanghua. This semester, she became a freshman at the university. She is studying in the Department of Political Science.</p>
<p>Her acting began two years ago. After watching Xia Xia's "The Beginning of Man," a classmate once said to her, "Jiang Hong, can you play the role of Xiao Lilian?" She had never acted before, but she boldly replied, "This is a kind of knowledge, and I am willing to try to learn it." So she worked hard in art.</p>
<p>She has guest-starred in plays such as "Working Women," "Boudoir Complaints," "Devastated Life," "Thunderstorm," "A Dog and a Woman," "Debt," and "The Beginning of Man" in drama troupes such as "Zhi Fu," "Gong Hua," "Guanghua," and "Hua Guang." Recently, she played the Empress Dowager Cixi in "Qing Palace Grievances," and became famous in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Her acting has always been a guest role. She has never joined any drama troupe, and has never received any subsidies or remuneration. She said, "I act because I like acting. Besides pursuing art, I have no other needs." Therefore, she is unwilling to be careless or casual when acting, but is cautious and attentive every step of the way. - The success of the Empress Dowager Cixi is naturally not accidental.</p>
<p>From September 3rd, the sound of the bell drove her from the stage to the classroom. Now she is no longer performing in the Qing Palace. She said, "School has started, I have to study hard. I can't neglect my precious studies for the sake of acting."</p>
<p>Speaking of studying, she is very hardworking. She usually likes to read works by Shakespeare, Ibsen, Shaw, etc., and she has also read a lot of books on drama theory. Among foreign movie stars, she most admires Norma Shearer.</p>
<p>Jiang Hong's acting skills are admired by everyone, and especially her spirit of burying herself in diligent study is truly worthy of being a good model for every artist and every young person!</p>
<h3>Mei Lanfang Willing to Devote Himself to the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>According to Tong Zhenmin, the assistant manager of Minhua, when he was in Hong Kong hosting the screening of "Confucius," Mei Lanfang also went to visit. Mei was very interested in the film and specially asked someone to introduce him to Tong for a chat. After watching the trial screening of "Song of Ancient China," it aroused Mei's intention to devote himself to the silver screen, and he was very interested in bringing his masterpiece to the screen as a memorial.</p>
<h3>After Watching "The Miser"</h3>
<p>— Luolü</p>
<p>This time, Huaxia performed "The Miser."</p>
<p>It truly targets the current society. There are countless people like Hua Binggang, who are greedy and stingy, on this isolated island. "The Miser" is a five-act satirical comedy. Its general idea is about a miser who sees money as his second life - Hua Binggang (i.e., the miser). For money, he hates and suspects everyone, even his own children. He wants to marry Miss Fan, his own son's lover, as his second wife, but because the Fan family is very poor and has no dowry, he comes up with a cunning plan, which is to arrange for his own son to marry a rich widow in order to get a rich dowry. At the same time, because of greed, he agrees to marry his own daughter, Yingmei, to Mr. Fan, a gentleman, as his wife under the condition of "no dowry." But things are not that simple. There are many complicated problems involved, but in the end, Miss Fan marries the son of "The Miser," and Yingmei also marries her lover. As for Hua Binggang himself, as long as he can keep his money, he doesn't care about anything else. The most successful actor is Ou Hua, who plays "The Miser." Ou Hua has always been known for playing old men, and it is most suitable for him to play this stingy old man this time. He portrays the psychology of a "Miser" vividly. Zhang Qiu, who plays Yingde, and Lan Zhi, who plays the matchmaker, are also successful. The remaining Qian Ji, who plays Fan Liqiong, is still competent, Zhang Yong (played by Wang Chen) seems to have some stiff stage steps, Hua Yingmei (Zheng Xiang) can raise her lines a bit, and the rest are fine. It is very difficult for an amateur drama club to have such excellent achievements. Brief News (1) The first anniversary of the Guolian Grand Theater is approaching, and it has been decided to screen "Forever and Ever," a giant film by Yihua. In order to show its grand occasion, the theater has specially made a kind of Li Qinian perfume and distributed it to the audience. (2) The 6th was the 59th birthday of Madame Gu, the mother of Dr. Gu Yuqi. The Gu brothers, in order to entertain their parents, invited many famous singers to perform a half-day Qingchang at their residence. It started at about 3 pm, with many wonderful plays, and ended happily at 10 pm. (3) Ms. Jiang Yingqing is good at chanting and storytelling. She once wrote the Yang Guifei singing chapter by hand and handed it over to Shen Xuekai to sing. The intonation was rich and magnificent, and the listeners valued it. Now she has compiled the complete lyrics of "Yu Li Hun" and asked Xue Xiaoqing to broadcast it on a selected date. (4) The Chinese Amateur Music Society has specially set up a "Free Harmonica Class," divided into elementary and advanced classes, and hired Bao Mingshan to be responsible for teaching. It is a quick one-month course, the tuition fee is waived, and anyone can join regardless of gender or whether they have learned or not. You can register at 3rd Floor, Zhejiang Ning Building, Ningbo Road every evening from 7 to 9 pm.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Rain Blossoms</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Taking the Beloved Bird Out of the Cage Early</p>
<p>Today, the country has reached a critical moment, but those with power do not want to exert their strength, and those with wealth do not want to spend their money. How can we save the country from its difficulties, but only worry about our own safety? This is too selfish. These people also have to suffer! So she feigned saying to Tian Hongyu: "Even the emperor's father-in-law has no way to think, how can we little women have any way? We have to rely on you. When the bandits come, you group of officials should come up with good plans early to put them out so that they don't become difficult to eliminate like weeds. You usually don't know the news in advance, and you don't maintain peace before it happens. When disaster strikes, you can't stand up and share the worries of the court. Isn't this very ashamed?" When Yuanyuan said this, she was extremely sarcastic. Tian Hongyu's face turned red involuntarily, and he sighed and said, "Yuanyuan, are you scolding the civil and military officials in the court? Or are you aiming at the old man? Alas! Your words are so sharp that they leave me with nowhere to stand." Yuandao: "Where dare I say the adults are wrong? I only deeply hate that the general ministers cannot quell the chaos for the country, which has led to the deterioration of the situation day by day. If the bandits enter Beijing, I am prepared to die. If the adults sacrifice themselves for the country, we might as well die together." These words were also Yuanyuan's attempt to test Tian Hongyu's mind. In fact, Yuanyuan may not be prepared to die. Her heart has a different kind of longing. But when Tian Hongyu heard these words, his brows furrowed even tighter. He shook his head and said: "Death is heavier than Mount Tai, and lighter than a feather. If I die like this, although it is to repay the kindness of the emperor, it is too meaningless. I have never held political power. More me may not be a blessing to the court, then if I am not among them, it may not harm the Ming Dynasty, so why should I die? In my twilight years, getting Qing, I thought it was a god-given relationship. I just want to wish that the flowers are always good and the moon is always round, and get along with Qing forever. Why do you talk about death? The old man can't bear to see you die, and he can't bear to abandon these happy days and become a tomb person. Yuanyuan, besides dying, is there no other way?" (163)</p>
