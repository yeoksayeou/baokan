<h3>初次會談逾一小時美日雙方均守緘默　來栖野村昨續訪美國務院赫爾稱不能遽言樂觀悲觀</h3>
<p>合衆社十八日華盛頓電　來栖、野村昨離白宮時、對於各記者所詢會談情形、祇稱「曾談及甚多事件」、詳細談判將於週末開始、詢及此次會談是否滿意、來栖矚記者轉詢野村、詢及來自日本之報吿、均表示美、日關係無和解之機會時、野村答稱、「此純為猜測而已、並不確實」、赫爾稱、初次會談係普通性質、目前為時尙早、不能斷言大局樂觀、或悲觀、赫爾今日將再接見來栖、</p>
<p>路透社十八日華盛頓電　日本駐美大使野村、今日對於解決美、日間各項困難之會談、聲稱樂觀、野村今日偕日特使來栖同至美國務院、繼續與美國務卿赫爾會商時、語在該處等候之各訪員云、吾人認為甚有希望、何以此間各報之論調均如此幽鬱、野村又含笑續稱、君等美人均常有戰鬥之性情、君等何以如此驚惶乎、某訪員謂、東京各報之論調、亦無甚和平之傾向時、野村付諸一笑、</p>
<p>路透社十八日華盛頓電　來栖、野村昨入國務院與赫爾作初次談話時、而呈相當的嚴重之象、閱牛小時後、來栖等穿街而入白宮時、新聞記者五十人及攝影記者若干人粉擁向前而包國之、但未能稍有所獲、因來栖、野村皆拒不發言、甚至拒絕攝影之請、不願稍立以待其攝影也、彼等亟亟趨入汽車、不待車門閉上、即令車夫速駛、致某記者為車門所觸、幾乎受傷、赫爾旋於招待新聞記者時聲稱、此次談話僅為初步性質云、雖國務卿所謂初步性質之寒喧客氣話與一般周旋似無須七十分鐘之久、然此間確未有眞正趕緊辦事之任何景象、此次談話始終以從容不迫之形式進行之、蓋時間之延長、顯然利於美國、而不利於日本也、赫爾因未有時間硏究日相東條之言論、故不願對此言論加以討論、惟此間一般反響、以為日本果眞欲得太平之和平與對美之良好關係、則不合時之愚論、莫此為甚、</p>
<p>東條所提要求美決不能承認</p>
<p>據路透社特派員所言、華府人士以為、日本旣派特使來美謀取解決辦法與和好關係、而猶髙據屋巓大聲呼號、提出顯為美國所不能承認之耍求、如東條今在其特使尙未及啓齒時遽發表於議會者、直可視為發動討論之最惡劣方法、東條所言者、當然僅為來栖挾至美國之要求、但若東條此言果表示來栖所負之使命、則此使命不待進行即已註定失敗矣、東條提出之一二點要求在此間人士觀之、可歸納於一個要求、即美國承認日本之侵略與其侵略至今而得之結果及日本在西太平洋與東亞之霸權是已、此固僅為討價、日本定願接受較低之價格、然此種討價、無論减低多少、此間殊未見其有可落於美國所可接受的限度以內之希望也、衆認來栖此行、就日本言、可謂徒費時間、但亦不盡無益、蓋美國力量强大、意旨堅定、在軍事上與經濟上、逈非日本所可匹敵、此種情形為日駐美代表似未了解者、今來栖或可以此轉達東條內閣矣、而就美國言、談話愈久美國愈有利因其戰具出產將愈增高、而其軍艦與商船亦將造成愈多、不僅此也、英、美加諸日本之經濟限制、其摧毀效力、亦將愈甚、是以美國儘可安坐、以視日本此後之行動、今美國所為者、似即此耳、</p>
<p>合衆社十八日東京電　政府日員本日正研究來栖與羅斯福總統會晤之第一次報吿、但現時尙未表示局勢是否業已惡化、據接近海軍省方面稱、海軍已完全準備保衛日本、以防任何威脅或攻擊、但仍希望華盛頓談話可使日本得以和平之方法獲得其國家之安全及繁榮、同一方面又稱、海軍贊成盡用各項可能之方法、以與美國和平修好、同時表示海軍必須準備美國不能承認日本為遠東主要國家之合法需要而發生最不幸之事變、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社十七日華盛頓電　日首相東條昨在議會所發表之演說、此間官方雖無反響、惟接近國務院者咸謂、東條對解決美·日問題所提出之條件、與美國遠東政策之基本原則完全相反、日本侵略中國一層、美國斷難承認、東條要求美國「聽任日本目行結束中國事變」、亦不能予以接受、至於日本希望美國緩和經濟封鎖、日政府倘能提供保證、放棄其「侵略政策」、則美國方面未始無商量之餘地、耍之、美國決當貫澈其遠東政策、來栖不遠千里而來、雖足以使美、日談判進入新階段、但共結果必歸失散、談判情形如何、雙方均守緘默、能否成立折衷的協定、殆難預測、所可見者、來栖與野村離聞白宮時、似有不愉之色而已、</p>
<p>目前相同觀點僅為避免戰爭</p>
<p>合衆社十八日華盛頓電　權威界昨稱、美國或將予日本以同盟之地位、作為解決嚴重爭端之根據、日方人士認為空氣較過去數天之任何時間為有望、主要係因羅斯福總統及國務卿赫爾接待野村、來栖與彼等晤談之友好態度又稱、美官員將指出日本外交政策之通盤改變為協調之唯一可能根據、否則美國對於如東條在議會所言之要求將不予以考慮、又稱、除非日本願意考慮退出軸心、並轉向其國家力量以援助民主國對付希特勒、則美國將拒絕東條所提鬆弛經濟封鎖及停止援華之要求、該方面人士稱、於此條件之下、美國或可利用其地位、期使日本與蔣委員長和解、而日本則可在此種解決中、以與其他西方强國之平等待遇及中國主權之充分合作得到在華之合法經濟權利、又稱、美國或將採取另一步驟即增加對中國之援助、認日本之南進即將威脅美國之主要原料之來源、因此、日如進攻泰國、即視為對美國之直接攻擊、一旦戰事發生時、美國對華接濟路綫之如何維持、據稱、美國恐將以「陸地護航」、以保護運輸、靈通界並稱、至目前為止、美·日之僅有同意、為共同希望避免太平洋之戰事耳、</p>
<p>合衆社十八日東京電　東京各報咸撰文評論首相東條及財相東鄉之演說、以日本堅定不移之推進國策決心、警吿敵對日本之國家、尤其是美國、朝日新聞社評謂、一首相明白宜布我國外交政策之三大原則、同時表示政府萬一之應變決心、日日新聞稱、美國如放棄對日敵對態度、則英國及荷印將踵隨美國「以太平洋危機得以挽救、」又言、「美國一日能繼續援助蔣委員長、而干涉日本解決中國事件之努力、則美·日關係之基本調整絕對無望」云、</p>
<p>路透社十八日東京電</p>
<p>此間報紙社論因政府人員未披露美·日談話之現有狀態、表示失望、中外商業新聞稱華盛頓之外交折衝、為日本帝國前途所繫當局應發表關於此事之更多情報云、朝日新聞稱、如能使美國了解日本眞正意旨、則前途非全無希望云、</p>
<p>對日談話趨勢美將通知英國</p>
<p>路透社十八日倫敦電　美政府將以赫爾、來栖星期一在華盛頓開始的「和或戰」談話之趨勢、通知英國、查英相邱吉爾聲明、美國如果對日交戰、英國將於一小時內宣戰之時、來栖已離東京、英相之言、對於整個遠東具有　長之影　、且能影響刻在華盛頓進行之談話、英·美今在遠東採取平行之政策、如對其他許多國際問題然、兩國咸担任協助中國爭取自由之戰爭、而給予一切可能的物質援助、日兩國皆巳凍結日方資金、此於日本必有重大影響無疑、而日本之經濟資源、工業與生活標準、因中國戰事而呈枯竭者、蓋已久矣、英、美兩國更巳關明在任何基本問題上、決不準備對日讓步、本週間東京所發演說、未使目前之間題有何進展、而召開議會、如果意在引起他國之震驚、則此舉已證明其為無效果之濕爆竹矣、日本所揚言對軸心國之忠心、邇來定巳受重大打擊、墨索里尼之狼狽境遇、顯係對日本之警吿、而東京現亦獲見德軍旣受絕大損失、現復為大雪所阻、或將僵待過冬、而不能達其主要目的、日本更將見紅軍堅定作戰、並未調出常駐東方注視不懈之蘇方大軍、</p>
<p>路透社十八日倫敦電　官塲對於太平洋局勢之前瞻雖不置評、然鑒於日首相東條外相東鄉昨在議會演說之强硬語調極表悲觀、消息靈通人士聲稱、空言之時間巳過去、今後數日、唯以行動是計、英、美對太平洋與遠東局勢之態度極明晰、而華盛頓談話中打破僵局之任何新發展、須由日相東條為之、迄今為止、日政府已暗示其欲從談話中獲取者為何物、而未表示日本準備提供何種酬報、太乎洋之和平、現繫於美、日間之談話、但如泰晤士報華盛頓訪電所傳者、日政府欲避撤退中國與越南日軍等重要間題、或圖保持廣大區域之控制、以及對美國在遠東的均等貿易權之存在、則和平之望、可謂極微、一般人雖料美政府將以對日談話事、不斷通知英政府、但對談話之可能的結果、則並不抱樂觀之希望、而無疑的現已採取種種可能方法、以備應付萬一、</p>
<p>華方人士意見美日終難妥協</p>
<p>路透社十八日重慶電　華方各報及官方人士之意見、咸以為美·日間不能有任何妥協、來栖赴華盛頓之使命定將失敗、而各界人士亦皆以美·日談判為其揣測之資料、共中雖幾一致認為兩國間不能有任何一般之妥協、惟承認頗有局部妥協之可能、並以為談判完全破裂之機會亦甚微少、因美·日似皆不願目前在太平洋作戰也、關於局部妥協之可能性、約有二種、　日本如允保證將不北攻或南進及最少將在現時之歐戰中保守中立、則美國至低限度將局部緩和共目前對日之經濟壓迫、　美國將担任中·日戰事之調停、惟以上兩種可能性、將僅能延展雙方一決之期、使美·日危機留待日後解決、因其對於還東間題並未予以圓滿及永久之解決也、在第一種可能性中、常蘊有日本待時而作繼續侵略行動之危險、而在第二種可能性中、中國旣堅持日軍必須完全退出中國領土之要求、則中·日兩國間決無妥協之可能、同時美·日談判亦仍有完全破裂可能性之存在、因日本常有極端份子推翻現政權、而完全控制政府、並使金國作瘋狂冒險之危機也、</p>
<h3>日議會通過　特別軍事預算　並決議指摘美國行動日大量徵兵達二百萬</h3>
<p>合衆社十八日東京電　貴族院本日一致通過三·八〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇日元特別軍事費用預算法案、並未加以任何修正、該法案昨晚已由下議院迅速通過、同時下院委員會已開始審查關於米稅曁增加生產及促進工業設備之三大重要法案</p>
<p>路透社十八　東京巿　今日衆院通過決議案、聲明解決中國戰爭之最大阻力厥為美國領導諸敵對國所作之行動、並稱、軸心國與英美·蘇聯目下之衝突、其主動力為美國稱霸世界之卑鄙的願望、該決議案由衆院各團共同提出、並由識員島田加以解釋、案中促請政府毅然決然實行固定之國策、案中有言曰、美政府立塲之不合理的性質、在拒絕承認並圖干涉日本求達自給、建設共榮圈推進東亞各民族和平經濟共存共榮之程序、巳顯而易見、日本人民深信非貫澈今次大戰、將無興盛之機會、案中又謂、增發公債與增加稅牽、實為戰爭起見、</p>
<p>路透社十八日東京軍　情報局發言人石井今晨對外籍訪員謂、日日新聞所稱、苟非美國完全停止援助重慶、則日·美談話實無希望、此言殆可代表日本大多數之民意、惟石井對於政府之態度仍謹愼不予表示、石井評論東條昨在議會所發演說中述及之三點、謂此三點實表示日本所能施諸任何第三國之外交政策的一般原則、惟首相並未云及此三點為華盛頓談話之根據、繼涉及外相所云、日本在北境之利益有遭可能的威脅一節、謂日本不能容忍第三國在北境作任何干涉、所謂「北境一者、其主旨乃指日本與蘇聯之關係言、訪員問及蘇聯對日政府關於日船氣比丸觸浮雷沉沒案所提抗議如何答覆、石井答稱、此案現正在討論中、又問蘇聯已否承認該浮雷乃屬蘇聯者、石井仍稱、此點現正在討論中、</p>
<p>合衆社十八日東京電　日本廣知時報今晨撰評稱、議會昨日演說結果、「日本現已將手中所有之牌皆置於桌上、是以後事如何、端在美國、」該報素被認為代外務省發言、其言云、日本殊不見美、日何以不能成立協議除非美國不願承認日本有關一國安全基礎之需要、美、日戰事如果發生、將使「人類發生大毀滅、同時衆議院昨日放棄對政府演說之質問、故僅前任鐵相小川略有質問而巳、小川對美、日談判有質問、首相兼陸相東條稱、渠同意小川之主張、日本之外交不必過於秘密、是以渠將「盡可能」宣布外交及軍事之消息、以尋求日本人民之諒解、東條稱、渠並同意置國家於完全戰事基礎上、並採取足以取得軍費及增加軍事原料之財政政策、首相言、渠深知政府應加改進及變動、政府現正計劃此事云、</p>
<p>合衆社十八日倫敦電　此間消息靈通界稱、日本最近巳調全部軍隊入伍、數約二百萬員、靈通界稱、龐大數目之充分動員、可見日本軍事擴張僅受軍火及配備之限制、最近數月中、聞巳有後備軍十萬員被召入伍、最近情報稱、在戰時基礎上之日軍、現約近六十師團，每師團約二萬員及二十獨立旅、每旅五千員與騎兵數隊、此外日本有十二至十五坦克車隊、專家謂、日本陸軍在機械化大砲隊方面最弱、日軍除在突北五十萬、朝鮮、中國本部、台灣及法屬越南約近一百萬外、其在日本國內者、約五十萬名云、</p>
<h3>美總統請國會　批准海陸軍費　中立法修正案亦經簽署商船百艘即將裝置武器</h3>
<p>路透社十八日華盛頓電　羅斯福總統現已請國會續批准陸軍經費六·六八七·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、其中半數專供軍械之用、估計其中列有菲列濱陸軍經費二六九·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、增進國防配備與供應品生產經費三八八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、總統又主張許陸長依據租借案處署一九四一年三月十一日以後為陸軍購置之任何配備、總統在另一預算中、請以三〇八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元為海軍經費、內有商船武裝費一二〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、此之所謂武裝殆即國會在中立法修正案中所許用以抵禦潛艇攻擊之砲、此海軍預算將准海軍以三〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元經費、建造或購置或改造小船四百餘艘為埋雷及巡選艦、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>德蘇戰局的回顧與前瞻</h3>
<p>看看近來的形勢，我們似乎已經可以論斷，在明年春季以前，德軍不獨攻不下列寗格拉，衝不到高加索與中東，甚至希特拉所親自懸為他當前的目標—莫斯科的佔領，大槪也無從實現。在長約一千七百英哩，合華里五千里左右的整個戰綫上，早已在降着大雪；而這兩天來，嚴寒的氣侯，尤其到了頂點。在這樣一個典型蘇俄的冬季環境裏，如果交戰者沒有超人的耐寒力和防寒方法，則任何大規模的戰爭，總無法進行。意思就是說：在漫長的時期裏，由現在到明年四五月之際的）百多天內，德·蘇兩軍間，勢將出現一種相持的局面，等候春季來臨，再作決定性的戰　。有史以來大規模的劇烈戰爭，至於今日，總算已經結束了牠的第一個時期。</p>
<p>所以在這時候，可供給了我們一個非常適當的機會，對於這個德·蘇大戰的過去經歷，先作一個簡明的結算：另一方面，更對於牠當前及未來的開展，再作一個大槪的估計。</p>
<p>五個月來，大戰不分畫夜地進行着，兩方皆沒有絲毫喘息的期問。兩軍在前錢所動用的兵力，大槪始終在三百萬左右。根據德。蘇官方的統計，及其他各中立觀察家的估計，總結下來，兩方面所受的傷亡損失，也都已超過了三百萬人，換句話說，德國和蘇聯兩國前後所動用的總兵力，已經各在六百萬人左右。蘇聯方面，到底已經動用了牠總力量的若干分，現在還沒有見到比蛟正確的可靠數字，但牠是）直居於防守者的地位，所以抵抗力量的大小，一定是與進攻的力量搆成一個正比例，所以祗要一看進攻者的德　，到底已經用了幾分力量？連蘇軍用了力址幾分也就可以推測得出來。據英國方面所發表的估計，大槪是，如果徳國所能用到戰塲上的陸軍最髙額，是一千萬的話，那末，牠的力量已用到了十分之六，空軍方面，德國一對蘇聯開戰就動用了總力量的五分之四；而到十月初對莫斯科展間攻勢的時侯，又把共餘力量的一半，再集中到東綫。五個月來，德·蘇兩面所損失的飛機及坦克車，都各各超出了萬數以上。像這樣前錢從事戰鬥，過程中不斷損失，及後方繼續補充等種種龐大歡目加在一起，我們似乎可以得到一個正確的結論，大槪德·蘇所能用的總力量，現在已達到最高峯了。</p>
<p>德軍這回對蘇進攻中的最大特點，就在於、「閃電戰」的完全失效。德國可以一舉滅亡波蘭，擊潰法國；但對於蘇聯，却不得不一再發動新的攻勢。德軍第一次攻勢，僅僅把蘇軍壓迫退入一九三九年九月以前的國境之內，就無法再向前進展了，於是希特勒就補充了生力軍，作再度的重大進攻。這個第二次攻勢的最大收穫，是中路的佔領明斯克及斯摩倫斯克，以後就無法再向前進。接着牠又增加了生力軍，以南路烏克蘭，及北路列寧格勒為目標，從事第三次的攻勢。一場惡鬥後，南路先鋒不過達到尼泊河；北路則始終被阻在列寧格勒之外。一直到最後，南路蘇軍方自動退出了甚輔。這時德軍的進擊力量，又呈現了衰竭，而無法再向前推進，於是，十月一號起，希特勒就下了最大決心，明白宣佈擊潰蘇軍及冬季前奪取莫斯科的目的，所以一開始時的攻擊力量，是非常之猛烈的，這就是德軍的第四次攻勢。當這回攻勢初發動時，蘇軍曾稍露支架不易的徵象，蘇軍發言人也開始第一次承認，在人與物的兩方面，德軍都處於局部的優勢地位，可是一方面，氣候與地理的條件，大大幇助了蘇軍，而同時，蘇軍指揮部的機警及巧妙，與後衛軍隊的英勇戰鬥，也盡了最大的任務。因而蘇軍的生力部隊，能够源源開到莫斯科這一帶地區，而穩定了戰局。經過了將近五十天不分畫夜的惡鬥，到現在，德軍亳無疑義的，已經被阻在莫斯科的外圍綫上了，牠的攻擊力量已經成了强弩之末。現在形勢比較嚴重的，還是南路克里米亞島的戰局，但德軍縱使能佔領全島，離衝進高加索和中束，還差得遠哩。照形勢看起來，在冬季裏，希特拉現在未必有決心再發動第五次的攻勢。</p>
<p>所以，現在德軍面前最大的問題，並不是打仗，而反是如何過冬。據倫敦泰唔士報所說，蘇軍撤退後的區域，不獨是一片焦土，而且在這焦土上，還預先埋下了無數的地雷和炸彈。德軍不敢進住僅在剩的高大建築，甚至不敢恢復電六廠，提防電流一通，所有地雷完全爆發。交通綫不住受遊擊隊襲擊的情形下，食糧也是一個嚴重的問題。德軍冬季的苦况，是可以想見的了。可是一到明年春季來臨之後，主動一定要轉移到英。蘇兩國的手中，而開始決定性的出擊。歐洲黑暗勢力的消除，已經僅是一個時間的問題。</p>

<h3>輪奐地產公司經理　張文駿脫綁記前晚在揚子飯店前被架挾至鄕間途遇日軍脫險</h3>
<p>前晚（十七日）公共租界漢口路雲南路、曾發生綁架案一起、當時因無人知悉、　捕房亦未接獲報吿、迄昨被綁者已吿脫險、事始透露於外、茲經社聞社記者探誌各情如後、</p>
<p>備有汽車自行駕駛</p>
<p>無錫人張文駿、年三十八歲、住公共租界赫德路五二三號、素在福州路八十九號申逹大樓四樓四一二號輪奐地產公司任經理之職、該公司係南潯鉅富張姓所設、平日張以便利辦公計、特備有自備汽車九二九號一輛、自行駕駛、</p>
<p>飯店門口突被綁架</p>
<p>前晚九時許、張由漢口路雲南路口揚子飯店某號友人處出外、步出鬥口、正擬跨登自備汽車時、突由身後竄上綁匪三名、二穿長袍、一衣西裝、出盒槍二枝、威禁聲張、當被挾登車內、由一匪駕駛向西、至徐家匯天　橋堍、即停車下車、</p>
<p>架入農家暫宿一宵</p>
<p>張當被兩匪挾持、穿過鐵絲綱越入華界、同時目覩自備汽車由駕駛之匪、疾馳而去、不知何往、迨至當晚十一時許、大雨傾盆中、張又被匪挾往謹記橋附近某鄉村內、借宿一脊、迄至昨晨、仍由二匪促張起身、並盤詰張是否即甫潯張家人物、經張聲明係無錫人、但匪仍不信、</p>
<p>曹家花園肉票脫險</p>
<p>迨至八時許、乃由一匪持槍挾張同行步至漕河涇曹家花園附近、張因見該匪之盒槍藏於袴後、遂默作逃遁之計、移時、恰見日軍二名巡邏而過、乃高聲呼救、當經將該匪捕獲、連同肉票一併帶入隊部、張至此始告脫險，據悉被捕之匪徒名方旭憲、年二十六歲、南匯人、並稱該案係在逃之莫某主使、現張已安然返家、惟失車則仍杳無下落、</p>
<h3>殺兄慘案　昨偵查　徐達泉仍未發言</h3>
<p>華美藥房小主人徐頌堯慘斃一案、於昨日上午九時三十分、由法捕房先將主角兇手徐達泉解案公開偵查、徐仍穿灰嗶嘰襯絨長袍、形容則較上次見時更形削瘦、但其態度則依然瘋瘋顚顚、始終默不作聲、未發一言、嗣令坐下、囑其用筆書寫、詎徐手持毛筆、相持歷半小時許、卒未能書一字、再將其行兇時所持之斧、給彼閱看、渠視若未銳、亦不往取、據云徐自被捕覊押捕房中、雖飮食如常、惟</p>
<p>迄未開口</p>
<p>言語、故無法取得其口供、因此昨日偵查亦無從進行、現經改期至下月二日、徐達泉仍還押捕房、至於因該案而涉有罪嫌之徐父翔蓀·及包探陸贊元·探目徐開濤·及手印間攝影師陳子新（人稱老廣東）·同仁輔元堂書記繆象嘉·均被捕房扣押偵查後、其中除徐開濤一名、因並無罪嫌、已先予開釋外、其餘各人同於昨日下午三時、</p>
<p>公開偵查</p>
<p>但徐翔蓀因患有吐血病、由捕房特准改押汪企張療養院治療、昨日未到、據捕房偵查所得案情、以自本案發生後、查出其騐屍時涉有以假亂眞不法情事、故捕房即着手澈查、先派西探目向寳隆醫院調查、始悉徐頌堯之屍體、當時確實未曾車送同仁輔元堂檢騐、而此事完全由在逃之一五二號探員鍾炳昌·及被捕之一九三號探員陸贊元等</p>
<p>一手包辦</p>
<p>、後因死者徐頌堯家屬向捕房請求免騐、經捕房拒絕、兩探員始想出偷天換日的手段、以馬路間倒斃無名男屍一具、冒充徐頌堯之屍體、一方串同手印間攝影師陳子新及同仁輔元堂書記繆姓、幫同作偽、致騐屍時完全被朦蔽過去、據云當時曾由徐翔蓀給以鉅額賄賂、故現在捕房依湮減證據及行使賄賂罪控訴徐翔蓀、並因徐今天無故不到、將再</p>
<p>加以拘提</p>
<p>、改押捕房、以便隨時偵查云、至於探員陸贊元·及陳子新·繆象嘉、捕房均控以凍職之罪、繼據繆象嘉供、此事完全受探員鍾炳昌之託、幫同塡具屍格、當時不知徐屍係屬以假亂眞者、亦未受分文賄賂、陳子新供、十月二十七晨由捕房派往同仁輔元堂攝騐屍影、當抵逹時、即由鍾炳昌要求對徐頌堯屍體免予拍照、經我拒絕、鍾即在太平間內搬出徐頸堯及汽車夫兩屍、排在一起、我即拍照回去、實在</p>
<p>不知是假</p>

<h3>介紹　丁光燮畫展</h3>
<p>— 吳易生</p>
<p>丁光燮先生過去曾經開過好幾　個人　　，　　風　　為主要題材、　年我來滬永久、恰巧父欣逢他在新新公司舉行個展、我於飽覽之餘、覺得丁先生不　是一個田閱畫家、而且他對自然的奧秘的探索、像一位科學家、他歌頌自然的和諧的演律、却又像一位詩人、丁先生的作品裏、有很濃厚的牧歌底情調、這是他的風景繪畫的特徵、而他那透明的色感、和來自自然的一種柔　的詩趣、尤為丁先生可貴的藝術的成就、</p>
<p>這次丁先生的個展、當然也大部是風景畫、那一百多幅的和穆的、純化的、深刻的畫面、全是一個藝術家在自然生命裏所體騐到的美底和諧的紀錄、這裏沒有一點做作、一點欺騙、正和Coroe的畫面所吿訴我們的一樣、</p>
<p>英國文學家金斯萊說過、「不要坐失一個時機去觀賞任何的一美」「美」是神的大手筆、像現在窒息在一個烏烟瘴氣的都市裹有四年之久的可憐的人士、應該怎樣來珍視這次丁先生的畫展呢、</p>

<h3>洋粉不肯輕售　米麵運銷頗有所見</h3>
<p>洋米不斷到滬、太古公司慶元輪前日與瓊州•嘉應輪同日抵埠、瓊州慶元兩輪裝來大批洋米砂糖巳誌咋報、茲悉尚由香港來洋米五千一百包、均係工部局之平價小絞米、昨日洋米無市、國米因運輸不便、除有少數點綴客外、市上亦乏交易、</p>
<p>茲有周錫賡君投函本報云、者番公共租界與法租界當局執行進口米限價每石一百三十元、發售以還、孤島平民、莫不額手稱慶、歌功頌德、良以非藉兩租界當局之通力合作、實不易收此效果、顧茲事體大、進行伊始、頭緒紛繁、其間雖免若干處遭人批評、理所當然、惟此不足為當局病、蓋有以為工部局進口米之成本、最近依據申請所得之外匯、到申每　核計若干元、外匯係何價結下、米係何價計算、緣據豆米雜糧　業公會呈兩租界當局文、以法定外滙結價之小絞米、成本為一百十元、以黑市外匯計算小絞米成本、須一百七十餘元故也、又工部局進口米自一百十七元增至一百三十元、是否係水脚費用昂貴所致、蓋過去工部局進口米漲價、必佈吿其理由、此則不然、且自辦洋米發售以來、其鬥不知盈虧如何、虧則如何籌補、盈　如何分配、此亦市民所關心者也、麵粉自經當局佈告自十一月十五日起、在公共租界或法租界內如携一包以上移運者、設　當局許可證將遭處分、如向當局請領麵粉　行許可證、每包納費二角、以限制麵粉栘運於界內外、深表同意、惟於請領許可證事、尚有商討之處、蓋粉商如向粉廠或粉棧出貨、如數恒在一包以上、勢必先行領證備查、然如出貨到店、事實上究不能立即售完、設首次許可證限期已過、然後適有顧客需購一包以上之粉勢必又需領證、方能送貨、如此計算、每包麵粉、平添四角許可證費、揆之商品銷售原理自必加入成本、其最終目的、轉嫁於消費者無疑、常局現正課减輕平民負擔之際、竊以為有覆議之必要、又米糧在界內移運之許可證、並不納費、而麵粉在界內移遝、需要納費、巳是厚彼薄此、抑麵粉自進口上棧與出廠、早已完納關稅、或統稅每包一角、可進行無阻、然則工部局之需每包一角之手續費、衡情有無衝突、尚成問題、總之、仁政美德、欽遲無旣、謹自純潔立塲、不計言詞之工拙、有　善意的希望、　　洋粉因本街實消需要添　應市、而客幫待裝之貨曾有一部份美粉已經當局簽證、即可報關啓運、因此人心轉定、貨主不復急於賤脫、美粉砲台即　到四—一元、金龍牌初甚呆滯、旋以美粉轉站、日有本街零化、故亦有三十七八元售開、總計有一二千包成交、麩皮續挺、小包續砌半元云、</p>
<h3>黃豆躉批有到　食油囤戶復活</h3>
<p>食油　　實銷戶略有添取、囤胃亦佳、故市勢轉趨挺昂、結果比前回漲十餘元、統市成父大連豆油二十桶、江北豆汕三十七桶又生油三百聽、烟臺生油二百聽、大連豆油二十桶、大有廠淸油近千擔、又菜油五百擔、日華廠菜油三百桶、</p>
<p>黄豆邇日頗有　額抵埠、故市勢鬆動、昨由本街及厦門幫辦去天津陳金元二百包、又新金元五百包、價比前下跌三四元、又豆子一千八百六十包、及豆餅五千三百六十包、運往新加坡、</p>
<h3>黑滙一無成交　日美鈔同低落</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、中央及滙豐兩掛牌均平、滙豐小櫃檯價仍無變化、英美匯黑黑市中之本市劃滙仍無開展、在紐約劃帳之英金一辦士一二五、美匯三元、仍有供無求、迄未成交、</p>
<p>天津十八日（週二）電、今晨准市開盤告平、倫敦及紐約電滙均無變動、申滙降五角、為七十七元、聯鈔間盤昂一元五角、為四十七元　角、</p>
<p>香港十八日（週二）電、今晨滙市開盤平穩異常、各　仍無變動、</p>
<p>昨日外幣市况、英美金鎊隨現金價繼續暴落二十元、英金票尚屬平、美金票雖曾退至三十二元半、但後又回上至三十三元二角、比上日僅小一角、香港票趨勢尚穩、市價站平、日金票又趨低落、晚市退為三元二角半、朝鮮票則趨上漲、晚市亦升至三元二角半、</p>
<h3>形勢不利於黃金　低價幾乎破入萬八千元關</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗市、跌風愈形慘烈、價已狂退入一萬九千元大關內、數次險再破一萬八千元關、各方人心仍極虛軟、乃美日談判旣利賣方、香港大津等幫見高數度猛拋、雖銀行幫不斷仍進、大豐進五百數十兩、明豐天兀各進四百兩左右、但時和祥和錢兌業各出五白兩以上、價在盤旋中由一萬九千七百九十元退至午後見一萬八千一百元低價、終雖硬被提上、收市續軋小一千○九十元、全日交易共一萬三千七百八十兩、飾金軋小八十元、為一千九百廿元、紋銀暗市降至廿三叫元、</p>
<p>烚赤連小雨天</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）晨九點開市一萬九千七百五十元、計高五十元、開後忽起賣風、價頓狂跌、時和義豐順源明豐天元祥和猛售、價竟狂瀉一千二百五十元、入一萬九千元關、跌至一萬八千五百元、時見德孚鼎成德成收吸、天元明豐復進、遂起回風、步升力百元、見一萬九千元、義豐時和順源德成天元在賣風中活動、價再銳落七百元、降至一萬八千三百元、午刻永成祥和天　進提上至一萬八千六百元、順源聯興售出、午收進至一萬八千四百五十元、下午二點開市即低一百五十元、為一萬八千二百元、在賣風中又退至一萬八千一百元、天元順源大豐力進、抬至一萬八千四百元、祥和順源、又來賣小至一萬八千一百五十元、公和德孚大豐天元再父進猛抬、當見步升七百五十元、哄至一萬八千九百元、為祥和力售、四點收市一萬八千六百五十元、比上日收價續猛跌一千〇五十元、查已連小兩天、共狂跌二千六百五十元、當日有一千六百五十元高低、現金號之本牌金門市售價一萬九千元、收進此售出低一千元、</p>
<h3>公債絢爛之後　復歸平淡</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市為大漲小回、稍形疲落、此亦應有之步驟、大概因日美談判開始後、尚無消息遞到、市上各幫大都觀望待時、塲內交易多數為搶帽子進出頻繁、丙種又一度衝出七十元關、終仍破入、趨勢或將略形盤旋也、昨日上午久豐頗有進胃、聯和同康隨進、丙截又抬至七十元外、惟以沅成潤德賣出、更有寳隆現貨流出、竟至破入關內、更一度打破九元、午收即小半元許、午後久豐繼續買進、仁豐亦有需要潤德及實隆繼續賣出、聯和轉出、胡鶴記亦有求售、但故戶買進絡繹不絕、市價反略為回好、刻下情形、因在緊要關頭、有待新消息之刺激也、市價結果一致略回小二三角至六角不等、成交總數共計約二百卅萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>多空躊躇不前　紗市暫趨寗靜</h3>
<p>紗市穩定，此因大上大下之後、趨勢轉為平靜、新拋者因其底盤巳低、且原料雖同一下降、然對於成本方面予現在之紗價相差太遠、廠方非但不能盈利、反為虧本、所以新空者之興奮性大為减退、因之紗市轉入寗靜之途、不過有一部份雖仍在空頭方面作掙扎、由此進退力頗强也、二十支雙馬高價為一千六百七十五元、低價為二千五百七十五元、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、市象和平、為二千六百元、少頃跌至二千五百八十五元、然做多者頗不乏人、一霎間升至二千六百四十五元、繼聞取引所開盤平平、稍見下落、市况又復帶疲、絡續而鬆至二千五百七十五元、不料三收盤取引所紗布一律回高、人心大振、空頭紛起扒補、雙馬漸漸前進至二千六百七十五元、然價格過昂、有一批盈利人吐出、鬆至二千六百十元收盤、查牛日間成交統計二千九百五十元、</p>
<p>午後初開二千六百十元、「但樓面上空頭殊形活躍、一度跌至二千五百七十五元、繼後聞取引所紗布一律卜升、隨之而升至二千穴百三十五元、父鬆至二千六百零五兀、但收盤又見回昂至二千六百三十二元、</p>
<p>金雙馬期貨市况、免起鶻落、趨勢於盤旋中略帶堅態、蓋以回騰後環象上仍無顯著之展開、故買方躊躇不前、拉提之潛力遂見减弱、而空方為消息所阻、亦多審愼、市氣倏上倐落、於醞釀中似在期待展開、當晨初開出、十一月期為二三九零元、自經浮空之抵補後、一度高至二四四零元、旋又回落十二月自二千五百元開盤後、逐步上升、乃亦高達二千六百元、遠期初做為二六五零元、後以證券與金幫一度收購、遂上漲至二七一五元、入後散戶絡繹脫手、走勢又見軟化、午收近期小至二三六零元、十二月降至二五三零元、一月期回至二六四零元、午後以廠單與取引所較為挺進、人心見穩、多方求意轉濃、市價徘徊帶堅、各月期均見回昂、全日上落結果、近期上升十五元、十二月期好上五元、一月期軋大　十元。</p>
<h3>棉市形起色</h3>
<p>現棉情况稍見起色、粗棉價回高十元、但大衆仍不願過份虧本出售、仍作觀望態度、成交禾能旺盛也、茲錄昨日花號間掉動各棉行情如左、</p>

<h3>法政界的女禍</h3>
<p>— 丹心</p>
<p>本報歐戰叢談連日刋譯著「法國政界的女禍」一文，其中所述，讀之眞令人感喟無已，其實任何人如果放棄其天職，而唯聲色犬馬之好是求，只是葬送自己。</p>
<p>自由主義的法蘭西，有他過去光榮的歴史，也應該有他未來光明的前途，這些「女禍」的現象，是「憂勞興國，逸豫亡身」的一個彰明的例子，祇要他們能埋頭刻苦，這還是一個有益的敎訓。「女禍的事實如此，到底還是應該男兒自罪，雖然食色性也，可是男兒當自强。</p>
<p>眼看上海的仕女們，終日沉湎於舞塲酒肆，時代已將這些渣滓，送入垃圾桶，而這些渣滓，還安於垃圾桶的生活而不悔，結果只有、永遠葬送自己。我們希望陶醉在粉紅色夢中的中國靑年們，迷途未遠，應立即痛目憬覺，切莫走上自絕之路，無以自拔。</p>

<p>編輯先生大鑒：茲因居住問題，遭房東之無理壓迫殊感痛苦。緣鄙人於去年十一月一日租得現居之房屋，房東甬人應某（昔為航運商，戰後之暴發戶，現因航運中斷，專門經營房地產及囤貨）且另用　金地產公司之名義，彼自己住樓上統廂房，前後三間，其餘皆分租與人，鄙人當時租賃樓下廂房一大一小及樓上亭子間一間共大小三間，月租一百五十七元，水電捐等在內，訂期六個月，待六個月期滿後即要求加租叫十元，鄙人乃讓去樓上一間，併居樓下，房租未加然另加電費三元，計月租一百六十元該樓上一間，不久即行賃出月收租金六十元，且此次只許訂期三月，期滿後又加租卅元，計一百九十元，仍只許訂期三月，鄙人因覓屋困難，且動須小費，兒女等亦均在附近就職就學，故乃忍痛加與，至本月底又將滿期，彼於日前通知鄙人月加租一百十元，合計月租逹三百元之鉅，當即詢以加租之理由，據彼稱係根據黑匯美元核算，且稱期滿後如不遷讓，即照新房租計算，鄙人係一銀行退職行員，因病不能工作，平日生活全賴恤養金及戰前之少許積蓄維持，本已甚為困難，何堪再增如是之支出，且原籟（武進）淪陷後所有房屋器具多被毀，巳屬無家可歸，鄙人從未與人爭執，不知對此項無理加租能否拒絕，期滿之後，是否尚有遷讓期限，同居之其他房客亦均同抱此感，該房東全幢房屋內，月收租金八百餘元，支出方面不過水電費房捐及少許修理費而已。處此國難時期，理應同舟共濟，渡此難關，同屬國人，更不應以美元為加租之藉口，不圖一再加租，仍未能飽其慾壑，素仰貴報主持正義服務社會，願借一角，將此項情形，公之大衆。此請撰安李珍之敬上</p>
<p>編者按：此種房東，利慾薰心，無理可喩，直堪髪指。忝為國人，不思風雨同舟，以一己國難財得來之房屋，要刮得人家走頭無路，揆之法律人情，豈得為平？為今之計，祇要房客一致，經過合法手續，正式書面質問，提供證據指出該地產公司與房東之關係，看他還有面皮以外匯結算否？現在麵包奶粉汽油肥皂，一切日用品，電費地捐，都在跌價，房錢有何理由獨漲？租賃期限三月，區區要挾，人人皆知，此亦須在嚴重交涉時應與之爭論而取消之者。最後如置之不理，可向當局吿訴。</p>
<h3>禁止出租灶披間</h3>
<p>— 秋籟</p>
<p>自從上海成為孤島，因人口激增，釀成人多屋少之患。一般二房東乘機牟利，把房屋橫擱豎隔，裝成鴿子棚式；好像居住的目的就祗睡覺，除了睡覺以外，什麽洗哂，炊飯，行動等便一概不需要了。單幢或雙幢的衖堂房子，自來水龍頭通常只有一個，人家住得多了，你搶我奪，在上半天眞是擠得不堪；晒台上和天井裏都搭了屋子和天棚，衣服也沒有地方可晒；像蝸牛壳一般大小的房間，放了一些最簡單的傢具，若是再耍踱幾步方步，就要像產羝羊觸藩，進退兩難了。至於舉炊呢，灶披間又是什九出租了的，住戶不得不把火油爐，煤球爐之類放在房間裏燒。因此，界內的火警便層見疊出了。燒掉了屋子還不算，因架床疊屋，逃避不易，時常焚斃人命。</p>
<p>租界當局對於晒台搭屋，是在禁止之列的（但實際上搭蓋的並不少），還有擱樓禁搭，也曾計議及之，獨於灶披間出租，不聞有何禁阻，這是一個重大的疏忽。灶披間原為舉炊之所，所以建築多是牆壁，不易燃燒；且自來水管近在咫尺，即使失愼，也便於灌救。房間裏却都是箱籠床帳，又多板壁，擱樓，稍不愼，便成燎原之勢；且取水不便，往往因施救不及而釀成大禍。現在租界當局為杜火患，嚴厲查禁易燃品的囤積，這確一件善政。希望同時對於貪得無饜的二房東也予以裁制，禁止他們無限制的租住房客，把廚房也出租牟利！（酬移助學金）</p>

<p>法租界貝勒路，有一　　行，平時行門緊閉，似闃無一人。日來行前但見人頭擁擠，頓見熱鬧。原來該行正將以前之囤米，付之平糶，故有此氣象云。該行門前貼有幾重標語。左邊一條是：「哈哈！我們要賣平糶米！」語氣頗為新穎而有氣概；哈哈二字，更能傳神。</p>

<p>弟弟病了，據醫生說，是營養不足的結果，須用牛乳食補。</p>
<p>今天偶然看見「吉時洋行規定克寗奶粉五磅聽每罐七十元」的消息，心裏打算了半天，覺得還可以勉强應付。下班後便向會計處支了七十隻大洋，想買一聽試試。那知道走遍了各大公司藥房，都一致回說「沒有」。最奇怪的是　　大藥房二磅半的都索價七十元。只有中法大藥房能够遵守限價以七十元的代價曾給我一瓶，可是須當面開聽以防囤積。據店裏職員說：「若不開聽售給囤戶，可得一百二十元，而中法為商業道德計，不採此法。」難怪前面幾家都不願賣我了。</p>
<p>像中法大藥房這種奉公守法獨樹一幟的精神，眞是値得我們表揚的。最後，我希望各界多多介紹最便宜的店家，同時揭發不照限價的店家，物價的漲風總可以稍息了罷。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>

<p>十四　打英雄的生活</p>
<p>這一晚，他祇得先把蕭吉淸第一天所囑咐的話，以及這三天來那些武行如何玩弄秋海棠的情形，一起去說給紅舞台的一位正　武生聽。他知道這個人的資格很老，在上海又有相當勢力，張銀財平日那樣兇橫，見了他也不由不低頭，只消他肯說一句話，這重誤會便立刻可以解除，而秋海棠也就不致再夾在裏頭受許多閑氣了。</p>
<p>那人聽了這武管事的話，果然也很不平，當晚散戲的時候，便着實數說了張銀財幾句。</p>
<p>這樣張銀財才明白秋海棠是小老板介紹的人，心裏也不由卜分後悔，從此對待秋海棠便和氣了許多；他手下的那些武行不用說，都是看着他的顏色行事的，他跟秋海棠一和氣，別人也就不再侮弄他了。</p>
<p>可是這一來，也僅僅解除了秋海棠一半的痛苦，對於每天大摔大打的一塲，他的體力却還是不濟，尤其是打到結束的時候，全體武行照例要翻一套「扒虎船」，二三十個人像滾兀寳似的在台上翻着撲着動作都非常的快，稍微遲一些，便容易　到別人身上去，或者給別人壓住；而且祇要一個人出了岔子，其餘的人馬上都要受到影響，跟着台下就有一陣震天價的倒好起來了。（二六六）</p>

<h3>不易討好的「跑龍套」</h3>
<p>— 華羽</p>
<p>在舞台上執着旗幡血隨着戲中的文武官員左右的，這便是「跑龍套。」他們雖然不唱，也不武，在觀衆的眼光裏看來，是非常容易做，但在實際上，却也不容易，一齣戯的精彩，說不定會在這「跑龍套」走錯了步伐而减色，給予觀衆一個不良的印象。</p>
<p>談到「跑龍套」的待遇，是比任何角色都低微。「跑龍套」的職務，雖不怎樣重耍，但比任何角色却要辛苦得多。在其他的角色，用不着他演唱的時候，儘可躱在後台息息力，養養神，歇歇嗓子。惟有「跑龍套」就不能，照常還是在戯先出塲，戲了纔進內，雖然站得很長久的時聞，依然是一幕一幕的跟着文武官出塲，甚至「換衣不換人」，執着旗幡站在那裏，任你脚如何酸痛，精神如何萎靡，總不能偷一回懶。而所得的待遇呢，是那麽的菲薄。在主要的角色，雖然能唱能武，但決不會像「跑龍套」出塲的次數多，也決不會像「跑龍套」那樣的忙，而其所得的代價，總要比「跑龍套」多出好幾倍，或者還不止幾倍呢。</p>
<p>天下事本來就是如此，操有職權及地位比較高的人，儘可閑着不做事，拿的是大錢。職　較小的人，工作是那樣的繫重，手不停脚不住，拿的是極少的報酬。「工作多而待遇少」，却是件令人最掃興的事。所以我們往往看見這些「跑龍套」，站在台上，總是沒精打彩的。這或許是因為出塲的次數太多，而身體疲憊下來，在這種情形之下，也就難保不住走錯了步伐。</p>
<p>如果「跑龍套」的待遇，能够給他們增高一些，雖不能如配角的那麼多，也或能够與共他的工作平衡。但是，無論在那一齣戯裏，似乎又缺少不了「跑龍套」，要是沒了「跑龍套」的話，恐怕也不成其為戯了。</p>

<p>尤其，寫吳三挂（舒適飾）的個性，作者是化上點功夫的</p>
<p>。我們只要看到吳三桂的不時抓鼻子，（這一習慣是完全有考據的。）他的陰險，狡滑和心懷叵測的作為，不論從行動上，或語氣中，我們都可以看得淸淸楚楚，而被吸引去的。</p>

<p>吳三桂率大小偏裨將佐出迎，且出牛酒犒勞淸軍。多爾袞遂令三桂的軍隊各用白布繫在肩上為號，做淸軍的前驅，導引淸軍長驅而入。在一片石地方和流寇相遇。那時李闖的部下多歷戰陣，甚為剽悍，起初尚未知道淸軍入關，還以為吳三桂的軍隊前來迎戰，因為三桂乞師於淸，是十分秘密，沒有向關內宣傳之故，李闖自恃兵馬衆多，那裏把吳三桂放在心上？兩軍旣近，各自結陣。李自成排的一字長蛇陣，自北山亘海，旌旗密佈，聲勢十分雄壯。淸軍鱗次布列，盡伏吳三桂大軍之後。三桂的部下身當前敵的，就是馬寳和白顯忠兩軍。張蒼虬等都在軍中。兩邊擂起戰鼓，各振聲勢。馬寳立馬在大　旗下，張蒼虬陳飛在他身側。馬寳將手拍着張蒼虬的肩膀說道·「今天我們初次堂堂正正和流寇會戰。倘能一戰而勝，流寇覆敗之餘，必然其勢衰頹，一蹶不振。况且淸軍在後面蟭着，我們也小可不在他們面前顯一些身手，爭一些顏面，這個關係非輕。張把總平日忠義奮發，常欲為國討賊，今日可以多斬幾個賊首了。」張蒼虬聽了馬寳的話，心頭更是興奮。遂對陳飛說道：「我和你到陣上去厮殺一回，不要給淸軍笑我無人。」（三二二）</p>
<p>筆者在排演室內與魏先生談到他寫吳三桂時的主意，他說·「我寫吳三桂，是還他一個英雄的本來面目，不過，這英雄是個「個人主義」的英雄，所以，他祇會替自己打算，想從高官厚祿轉而為謀王纂位的封建統治者。同時，也就從這點上，就注下了他必然失敗的原因。」</p>
<p>這時，我就唯唯而退，希望能在「楊娥傳」演出時來認識一下吳三桂，和他的沒落。</p>

<h3>Initial Meeting Exceeds One Hour, Both U.S. and Japan Remain Silent; Kurusu and Nomura Continued Visits to the U.S. State Department Yesterday, Hull Says It's Too Early to Be Optimistic or Pessimistic</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 18th - When Kurusu and Nomura left the White House yesterday, they only said "many incidents were discussed" when reporters inquired about the meeting. Detailed negotiations will begin this weekend. When asked if they were satisfied with the meeting, Kurusu directed reporters to ask Nomura. When asked about reports from Japan indicating no chance of reconciliation between the U.S. and Japan, Nomura replied, "This is purely speculation and not accurate." Hull said the initial meeting was of a general nature, and it is too early to say whether the overall situation is optimistic or pessimistic. Hull will meet with Kurusu again today.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 18th - The Japanese Ambassador to the U.S., Nomura, expressed optimism today about the talks to resolve various difficulties between the U.S. and Japan. When Nomura, accompanied by Japanese special envoy Kurusu, went to the U.S. State Department today to continue discussions with U.S. Secretary of State Hull, he said to the reporters waiting there, "We believe there is great hope. Why are the editorials in the newspapers here so gloomy?" Nomura then added with a smile, "You Americans are always of a fighting nature. Why are you so alarmed?" A reporter said that the editorials in Tokyo newspapers were not very peaceful either. Nomura just smiled.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 18th - When Kurusu and Nomura entered the State Department yesterday for their initial talks with Hull, they appeared quite serious. After an hour, when Kurusu and others walked across the street into the White House, fifty reporters and several photographers rushed forward to surround them, but to no avail. Kurusu and Nomura both refused to speak, even refusing to pose for photos or wait for a moment for them to take pictures. They quickly got into their car and ordered the driver to leave quickly before the door was closed, nearly injuring a reporter with the car door. Hull later stated during a press briefing that the talks were only of a preliminary nature. Although the Secretary of State's preliminary remarks and pleasantries did not seem to require seventy minutes, there was no real sense of urgency. The talks proceeded in a leisurely manner from beginning to end. It is clear that the extension of time benefits the United States and not Japan. Hull was unwilling to discuss Japanese Prime Minister Tojo's remarks because he had not had time to study them. However, the general reaction here is that if Japan truly wants peace and good relations with the U.S., then there could not be a more inappropriate and foolish statement.</p>
<p>Demands Raised by Tojo Unacceptable to the U.S.</p>
<p>According to a special correspondent for Reuters, Washington officials believe that Japan, having sent a special envoy to the U.S. to seek a solution and harmonious relations, is still shouting from the rooftops and making demands that are clearly unacceptable to the U.S. Tojo's abrupt announcement in Parliament before his special envoy could even speak is considered the worst possible way to start a discussion. What Tojo said is undoubtedly the demands that Kurusu brought to the U.S., but if Tojo's statement represents Kurusu's mission, then that mission is doomed to failure before it even begins. One or two of Tojo's demands, in the view of people here, can be summarized into one demand: that the U.S. recognize Japan's aggression and the results it has achieved so far, as well as Japan's hegemony in the Western Pacific and East Asia. This is, of course, just a bargaining chip, and Japan will certainly be willing to accept a lower price. However, no matter how much this bargaining price is reduced, there is little hope that it will fall within the limits acceptable to the U.S. Many believe that Kurusu's trip is a waste of time for Japan, but it is not entirely without benefit. The U.S. is strong in power and resolute in will, and it is militarily and economically far superior to Japan. The Japanese representatives in the U.S. did not seem to understand this situation, but Kurusu can now convey this to the Tojo cabinet. As for the U.S., the longer the talks last, the more advantageous it is for the U.S. because its war production will increase, and it will build more warships and merchant ships. Not only that, but the destructive effect of the economic restrictions imposed on Japan by the U.S. and Britain will also be greater. Therefore, the U.S. can sit back and watch Japan's future actions. It seems that this is exactly what the U.S. is doing now.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 18th - Government officials are studying the first report of Kurusu's meeting with President Roosevelt, but have not yet indicated whether the situation has deteriorated. According to sources close to the Ministry of the Navy, the Navy is fully prepared to defend Japan against any threat or attack, but still hopes that the Washington talks will enable Japan to obtain its national security and prosperity peacefully. The same sources also said that the Navy supports using all possible means to make peace with the U.S. while also stating that the Navy must prepare for the most unfortunate events that may occur if the U.S. does not recognize Japan's legitimate needs as the leading nation in the Far East.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 17th - Although there has been no official reaction here to Prime Minister Tojo's speech in Parliament yesterday, those close to the State Department said that the conditions Tojo proposed for resolving U.S.-Japan issues are completely contrary to the fundamental principles of U.S. Far East policy. The U.S. will never recognize Japan's invasion of China, and Tojo's demand that the U.S. "allow Japan to complete the China Incident" cannot be accepted either. As for Japan's hope that the U.S. will ease the economic blockade, if the Japanese government can provide guarantees to abandon its "policy of aggression," then the U.S. side may be open to discussion. In short, the U.S. is determined to implement its Far East policy. Although Kurusu's arrival from afar is enough to bring U.S.-Japan negotiations to a new stage, the results will certainly be scattered. Both sides remain silent on the progress of the negotiations, and it is difficult to predict whether a compromise agreement can be reached. What is clear is that Kurusu and Nomura seemed unhappy when they left the White House.</p>
<p>The Only Common Ground at Present is Avoiding War</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 18th - Authoritative sources said yesterday that the U.S. may grant Japan allied status as the basis for resolving serious disputes. Japanese sources believe that the atmosphere is more promising than at any time in the past few days, mainly because of the friendly attitude of President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull in receiving Nomura and Kurusu and meeting with them. They also said that U.S. officials will point out that a comprehensive change in Japanese foreign policy is the only possible basis for coordination, otherwise the U.S. will not consider demands such as those made by Tojo in Parliament. They also said that unless Japan is willing to consider withdrawing from the Axis and turning its national strength to helping the democratic countries against Hitler, the U.S. will reject Tojo's demands to ease the economic blockade and stop aid to China. These sources said that under these conditions, the U.S. may use its position to bring about a reconciliation between Japan and Chiang Kai-shek, and Japan can obtain legitimate economic rights in China in this kind of settlement through equal treatment with other Western powers and full cooperation with Chinese sovereignty. They also said that the U.S. may take another step, namely increasing aid to China, recognizing that Japan's southward advance is about to threaten the source of the U.S.'s main raw materials. Therefore, if Japan attacks Thailand, it will be regarded as a direct attack on the U.S. Regarding how the U.S.'s supply lines to China will be maintained once war breaks out, it is said that the U.S. may use "land convoys" to protect transportation. Informed sources also said that, so far, the only agreement between the U.S. and Japan is the common hope to avoid a war in the Pacific.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 18th - Tokyo newspapers all wrote articles commenting on the speeches of Prime Minister Tojo and Finance Minister Togo, warning countries hostile to Japan, especially the U.S., of Japan's unwavering determination to advance its national policy. Asahi Shimbun commented that the Prime Minister clearly announced the three major principles of our country's foreign policy, while also expressing the government's determination to respond to any eventuality. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun said that if the U.S. abandons its hostile attitude towards Japan, then Britain and the Dutch East Indies will follow the U.S. "so that the Pacific crisis can be averted." It also said, "If the U.S. continues to aid Chiang Kai-shek and interfere with Japan's efforts to resolve the China Incident, then a fundamental adjustment of U.S.-Japan relations is absolutely hopeless."</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 18th</p>
<p>Newspaper editorials here expressed disappointment because government personnel did not disclose the current status of the U.S.-Japan talks. Chugai Shogyo Shimpo said that the diplomatic negotiations in Washington are related to the future of the Japanese Empire and that the authorities should release more information about this matter. Asahi Shimbun said that if the U.S. can understand Japan's true intentions, then the future is not entirely without hope.</p>
<p>U.S. Will Notify Britain of the Trend of Talks with Japan</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th - The U.S. government will notify Britain of the trend of the "peace or war" talks that Hull and Kurusu began in Washington on Monday. When British Prime Minister Churchill declared that if the U.S. goes to war with Japan, Britain will declare war within an hour, Kurusu had already left Tokyo. The Prime Minister's words have a profound impact on the entire Far East and can influence the talks currently underway in Washington. Britain and the U.S. are now adopting parallel policies in the Far East, as in many other international issues. Both countries are committed to assisting China in its war for freedom and providing all possible material assistance. Both countries have frozen Japanese funds, which will undoubtedly have a significant impact on Japan, whose economic resources, industry, and standard of living have long been exhausted by the war in China. Britain and the U.S. have made it clear that they are not prepared to make concessions to Japan on any fundamental issues. The speeches made in Tokyo this week have not made any progress on the current issues, and convening Parliament with the intention of shocking other countries has proven to be an ineffective wet firecracker. Japan's professed loyalty to the Axis powers has certainly been severely hit. Mussolini's embarrassing situation is clearly a warning to Japan, and Tokyo is now seeing that the German army has suffered huge losses and is now blocked by heavy snow, perhaps to wait for the winter without achieving its main goal. Japan will also see that the Red Army is fighting firmly and has not withdrawn the Soviet army stationed in the East that is constantly watching.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th - Although officials are not commenting on the outlook for the Pacific situation, they are extremely pessimistic in light of the tough tone of the speeches made by Japanese Prime Minister Tojo and Foreign Minister Togo in Parliament yesterday. Informed sources said that the time for empty words has passed, and the next few days will be about action. The attitude of Britain and the U.S. towards the Pacific and Far East situation is very clear, and any new developments in the Washington talks that break the deadlock must be made by Japanese Prime Minister Tojo. So far, the Japanese government has hinted at what it wants to gain from the talks without indicating what rewards Japan is prepared to offer. Peace in the Pacific now depends on U.S.-Japan talks, but as reported by the Times' Washington correspondent, if the Japanese government wants to avoid important issues such as withdrawing Japanese troops from China and Vietnam, or seeks to maintain control of vast areas, as well as the existence of equal trade rights for the U.S. in the Far East, then the hope of peace is very slim. Although the general public expects the U.S. government to constantly inform the British government about the U.S.-Japan talks, they are not optimistic about the possible outcome of the talks, and have undoubtedly taken all possible measures to prepare for any eventuality.</p>
<p>Chinese Sources Believe U.S. and Japan Will Ultimately Find It Difficult to Compromise</p>
<p>Reuters, Chongqing, 18th - The opinion of Chinese newspapers and officials is that there can be no compromise between the U.S. and Japan, and Kurusu's mission to Washington will certainly fail. People from all walks of life are using U.S.-Japan negotiations as material for their speculation. Although they almost unanimously believe that there can be no general compromise between the two countries, they acknowledge that partial compromises are possible, and they believe that the chances of negotiations completely breaking down are very slim, because both the U.S. and Japan seem unwilling to fight in the Pacific at present. Regarding the possibility of partial compromises, there are roughly two types: If Japan is willing to guarantee that it will not attack the north or advance south, and will at least remain neutral in the current European war, then the U.S. will at least partially ease its current economic pressure on Japan; The U.S. will be responsible for mediating the Sino-Japanese war. However, both of the above possibilities will only extend the period of reckoning between the two sides, leaving the U.S.-Japan crisis to be resolved in the future, because they have not provided a satisfactory and permanent solution to the East Asian issue. In the first possibility, there is often the danger of Japan waiting for an opportunity to take further aggressive action, and in the second possibility, since China insists on the demand that Japanese troops must completely withdraw from Chinese territory, there is absolutely no possibility of compromise between China and Japan. At the same time, the possibility of U.S.-Japan negotiations completely breaking down still exists, because Japan often faces the crisis of extreme elements overthrowing the current regime and completely controlling the government, and causing the country to take crazy risks.</p>
<h3>Japanese Parliament Passes Special Military Budget and Resolves to Condemn U.S. Actions; Japan Massively Conscripts Troops Reaching Two Million</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 18th - The House of Peers unanimously passed the 3,800,000,000 yen special military expenditure budget bill today without any amendments. The bill was quickly passed by the Lower House last night. At the same time, the Lower House Committee has begun to review the three major important bills concerning rice tax and increasing production and promoting industrial equipment.</p>
<p>Reuters, 18th, Tokyo - Today, the House of Representatives passed a resolution stating that the biggest obstacle to resolving the war in China is the actions taken by the United States leading hostile countries. It also stated that the main driving force behind the current conflict between the Axis powers and Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is the despicable desire of the United States to dominate the world. The resolution was jointly proposed by various groups in the House of Representatives and explained by member Shimada. The resolution urged the government to resolutely implement its established national policy. The resolution stated: "The unreasonable nature of the U.S. government's position, in refusing to recognize and attempting to interfere with Japan's efforts to achieve self-sufficiency, build a co-prosperity sphere, and promote the peaceful economic coexistence and co-prosperity of East Asian nations, is obvious. The Japanese people are deeply convinced that there will be no opportunity for prosperity without persevering in this great war." The resolution also stated that issuing more public bonds and increasing taxes are for the sake of war.</p>
<p>Reuters, 18th, Tokyo - Information Bureau spokesman Ishii told foreign reporters this morning that the statement in the Nichi Nichi Shimbun that there is no hope for U.S.-Japan talks unless the U.S. completely stops aiding Chongqing probably represents the opinion of the majority of the Japanese people. However, Ishii remained cautious about the government's attitude and did not express it. Ishii commented on the three points mentioned by Tojo in his speech in Parliament yesterday, saying that these three points actually represent the general principles of foreign policy that Japan can apply to any third country. However, the Prime Minister did not say that these three points are the basis for the Washington talks. Referring to the Foreign Minister's statement that Japan's interests in the north are facing possible threats, he said that Japan cannot tolerate any interference by third countries in the north. The so-called "north" mainly refers to the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union. When reporters asked how the Soviet Union responded to the Japanese government's protest regarding the sinking of the Japanese ship Kibi Maru by a floating mine, Ishii replied that the case is currently under discussion. When asked if the Soviet Union has acknowledged that the floating mine belonged to the Soviet Union, Ishii still said that this point is currently under discussion.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 18th - The Japan Times and Mail commented this morning, "As a result of yesterday's speech in Parliament, Japan has now placed all the cards it has in its hands on the table. What happens next depends on the United States." The newspaper is generally considered to speak on behalf of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It said that Japan does not see why the U.S. and Japan cannot reach an agreement unless the United States is unwilling to recognize Japan's need for a foundation for national security. If a U.S.-Japan war breaks out, it will "cause great destruction to mankind." At the same time, the House of Representatives yesterday abandoned questioning the government's speech, so only former Iron Minister Ogawa asked a few questions. Ogawa asked about the U.S.-Japan talks, and Prime Minister and Army Minister Tojo said that he agreed with Ogawa's suggestion that Japan's diplomacy should not be too secret, so he would announce diplomatic and military news "as much as possible" to seek the understanding of the Japanese people. Tojo said that he also agreed to put the country on a complete war footing and take financial policies sufficient to obtain military expenses and increase military materials. The Prime Minister said that he knows that the government should make improvements and changes, and the government is currently planning to do so.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 18th - Well-informed sources here said that Japan has recently conscripted all its troops, numbering about two million men. Informed sources said that the full mobilization of such a large number shows that Japan's military expansion is only limited by munitions and equipment. In recent months, it has been reported that 100,000 reservists have been called up. Recent reports indicate that the Japanese army on a wartime basis now has nearly sixty divisions, with each division having about 20,000 men, and twenty independent brigades, with each brigade having 5,000 men, and several cavalry units. In addition, Japan has twelve to fifteen tank units. Experts say that the Japanese army is weakest in mechanized artillery units. In addition to the 500,000 in Northern China, Korea, mainland China, Taiwan, and French Indochina, there are about 500,000 Japanese troops in Japan.</p>
<h3>U.S. President Asks Congress to Approve Army and Navy Expenditures; Neutrality Act Amendment Also Signed; One Hundred Merchant Ships to Be Armed Soon</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 18th - President Roosevelt has now asked Congress to continue to approve 6,687,000,000 yuan for the Army, half of which is specifically for armaments. It is estimated that 269,000,000 yuan is listed for Philippine Army expenses, and 388,000,000 yuan for increasing national defense equipment and supplies production expenses. The President also advocated allowing the Army Chief to dispose of any equipment purchased for the Army after March 11, 1941, in accordance with the Lend-Lease Act. In another budget, the President requested 308,000,000 yuan for Navy expenses, including 120,000,000 yuan for arming merchant ships. The so-called armament is probably the cannon that Congress is allowed to use in the Neutrality Act Amendment to defend against submarine attacks. This Navy budget will allow the Navy to use 300,000,000 yuan to build, purchase, or modify more than 400 small ships as mine-laying and patrol escorts.</p>
<p>Reuters, Manila, 18th - The number of Philippine Army reservists has not been announced, but they have been ordered to report to their units for incorporation into the U.S. Far East Army. It is believed that the total number of these reservists is 150,000, all of whom will be incorporated in December.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 17th - President Roosevelt signed the Neutrality Act Amendment at 4:30 p.m. today, allowing U.S. merchant ships to be armed and sail to the ports of belligerent countries. One hundred U.S. giant merchant ships are ready to enter shipyards to install weapons.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 18th - U.S. passenger and cargo planes will fly directly to Britain under the Neutrality Act Amendment, and U.S. pilots can also take on the task of flying planes to Britain in accordance with the Neutrality Act Amendment.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Move Towards Thai Border</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th - The Daily Telegraph's diplomatic correspondent said today that as the British and U.S. navies gather in the Far East, it is reported that the Japanese ground and air forces concentrated in northern Vietnam are moving southwest towards the Thai border. The messages received here from Thailand all reflect a sense of anxiety.</p>
<p>United Press, Bangkok, 18th - The government issued a communiqué last night stating that Thailand is currently independent and sovereign, and no country can take away its independence. It also said that what was published in the Tokyo Chugai Shogyo Shimpo is part of Japan's current campaign to prove that Thailand is uniting with the U.S., Britain, China, and the Netherlands. At the same time, reliable sources here said that Thailand's highest commanders include Prime Minister Major General Plaek Phibunsongkhram as Army Commander-in-Chief, Rear Admiral Chalieo Tejapaibul as Navy Commander, and Air Vice Marshal Direk Chaiyanam as Air Force Commander.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Retrospect and Prospect of the German-Soviet War Situation</h3>
<p>Looking at the recent situation, we seem to be able to conclude that before next spring, the German army will not only fail to capture Leningrad, or reach the Caucasus and the Middle East, but even Hitler's personally declared current goal — the occupation of Moscow — will probably be impossible to achieve. On the entire front, which is about 1,700 English miles, or about 5,000 Chinese li, heavy snow has already been falling; and in the past two days, the severe cold climate has especially reached its peak. In such a typical Soviet Russian winter environment, if the belligerents do not have superhuman cold resistance and cold protection methods, any large-scale war will be impossible to conduct. What this means is: in the long period (from now to around April or May next year) of over a hundred days, a stalemate will inevitably occur between the German and Soviet armies, waiting for the arrival of spring before making a decisive battle. The large-scale and fierce war in history, as of today, can be considered to have ended its first period.</p>
<p>Therefore, at this time, it provides us with a very appropriate opportunity to first make a concise settlement for the past experience of this German-Soviet war: on the other hand, to make a rough estimate of its current and future development.</p>
<p>For five months, the war has been going on day and night, and neither side has had the slightest chance to catch their breath. The troops used by both sides on the front line have probably always been around three million. Based on the statistics from the German and Soviet official sources, and the estimates of other neutral observers, in summary, the casualties and losses suffered by both sides have also exceeded three million people. In other words, the total number of troops used by Germany and the Soviet Union before and after has each been around six million people. On the Soviet side, how much of its total strength has been used is still not known to have more accurate and reliable figures, but it has been in the position of defender, so the size of the resistance force must be directly proportional to the attacking force, so just by looking at how much strength the attacker, Germany, has used, we can infer how much strength the Soviet army has used. According to the estimate published by the British side, roughly, if the highest amount of land forces that Germany can use on the battlefield is ten million, then it has used six-tenths of its strength. On the air force side, Germany used four-fifths of its total strength as soon as it started the war against the Soviet Union; and when it launched its offensive against Moscow in early October, it concentrated half of its remaining strength on the Eastern Front again. In the past five months, the aircraft and tanks lost by both Germany and the Soviet Union have each exceeded ten thousand. Adding together such a vast number of items as fighting on the front lines, continuous losses in the process, and continuous replenishment from the rear, we seem to be able to reach a correct conclusion that the total strength that Germany and the Soviet Union can use has now reached its peak.</p>
<p>The greatest characteristic of the German military's offensive against the Soviet Union this time is the complete failure of the "Blitzkrieg." Germany can destroy Poland and defeat France in one fell swoop; but for the Soviet Union, it has had to launch new offensives again and again. The first German offensive only forced the Soviet army to retreat into the territory before September 1939, and it could no longer advance. So Hitler replenished fresh troops and launched a major offensive again. The greatest gain of this second offensive was the occupation of Minsk and Smolensk in the middle route, and after that, it could no longer move forward. Then it increased its fresh troops again, targeting Ukraine in the south and Leningrad in the north, and engaged in a third offensive. After a fierce battle, the vanguard of the south route only reached the Dnieper River; the north route was always blocked outside Leningrad. Until the end, the Soviet army in the south route voluntarily withdrew from the auxiliary. At this time, the German army's attacking power showed exhaustion again, and it could no longer advance. Therefore, from October 1, Hitler made the greatest determination and clearly announced the purpose of defeating the Soviet army and capturing Moscow before winter, so the attacking power at the beginning was very fierce, which was the fourth German offensive. When this offensive was first launched, the Soviet army showed signs of difficulty in support, and the Soviet spokesman also began to admit for the first time that the German army was in a local advantage in terms of both personnel and materials, but on the one hand, the climate and geographical conditions greatly helped the Soviet army, and at the same time, the vigilance and skill of the Soviet command and the heroic fighting of the rearguard troops also fulfilled the greatest task. Therefore, the Soviet army's fresh troops were able to continuously open up to the Moscow area and stabilize the war situation. After nearly fifty days of fierce fighting day and night, by now, the German army has undoubtedly been blocked on the outer perimeter of Moscow, and its attacking power has become the end of its tether. The situation that is relatively serious now is still the war situation on the Crimean Peninsula in the south route, but even if the German army can occupy the entire island, it is still far from rushing into the Caucasus and the Middle East. Judging from the situation, Hitler may not be determined to launch a fifth offensive in the winter.</p>
<p>Therefore, the biggest problem facing the German army now is not fighting, but how to survive the winter. According to the London Times, the area after the Soviet army's retreat is not only a scorched earth, but also countless landmines and bombs have been buried in advance on this scorched earth. The German army does not dare to live in the remaining tall buildings, and does not even dare to restore the power plant, guarding against the complete explosion of all the landmines once the current is turned on. With the traffic lines constantly attacked by guerrillas, food is also a serious problem. The German army's winter plight can be imagined. However, once next spring arrives, the initiative must be transferred to the hands of Britain and the Soviet Union, and a decisive attack will be launched. The elimination of the dark forces in Europe is already just a matter of time.</p>
<h3>US "Flying Fortress" Appears; Soviet War Situation Focuses on Both Ends; Germany Claims Capture of Kerch and Large-Scale Offensive Towards Caucasus</h3>
<p>Moscow TASS, 18th – On the 17th, our troops fought the enemy along the entire line. The fighting in the areas of Gassino and southwest was particularly fierce. On the 16th, 22 German planes were shot down, and we lost 6. On the same day, 11 German planes were shot down near Moscow. The previous report of 3 planes was inaccurate.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet border, Havas, 17th – An American "Flying Fortress" suddenly appeared today between Moscow and Leningrad.</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 18th – Today's Eastern Front news focuses on the extreme north and extreme south of the war. The Soviet forces in the north seem to be very successful, but in the Crimean Peninsula, the Germans claim to have occupied Kerch, and say "German troops are now facing the Caucasus." A Nazi headquarters spokesman said that German troops will attack the Kerch Strait, which is about eight miles wide and separates the Crimean Peninsula from the mainland. The Germans also report that German dive bombers and high-flying bombers are constantly attacking Soviet ships and transport ships carrying Soviet soldiers and supplies withdrawing from the Kerch Strait, and that the German army will attack the Caucasus as a major exercise in invading England. In the rest of the vast front, only the Soviets have repeatedly reported success. The battle situation in Leningrad seems promising. According to the Soviet news agency, the Soviet army is currently advancing rapidly along the left bank of the N River (roughly referring to the Neva River). The German troops on the Leningrad front have now been driven out of their strong positions, which they have held for two months, and are retreating. Although the Germans have repeatedly counterattacked, they have all failed. The Soviets have captured a lot of war equipment, and the enemy has suffered casualties. Soviet bombers and low-flying attack aircraft cooperated with artillery to destroy enemy artillery positions, clearing the way for Soviet infantry to advance. As for the Moscow front, the Germans have had to admit that they have been contained, and say that the reason is the bad weather. The Soviet government promptly recognized the danger threatening the Soviet capital, and rushed to mobilize fresh troops to join General Sokolov's Soviet troops to defend the perimeter of Moscow, resulting in new fierce battles, which are still in progress.</p>
<p>Soviet Army Builds Elaborate Underground Defenses on the Rybachy Peninsula</p>
<p>Although the German army in Leningrad recently cut off the railway from the area to Volokoda and put pressure on the Tikhvin area (110 miles southeast of Leningrad), Leningrad still maintains traffic with the rest of the Soviet Union. According to Soviet sources, the elite assault teams of the German army in northern Karelia have failed after attacking the Kesdanja area for two weeks, and 4,000 soldiers have died in the battle site trying to block Soviet traffic in the Murmansk region. In some areas, the German army has had to retreat. According to the Red Star newspaper, after more than five months of fighting, the Rybachy Peninsula in the northern part of European Russia is still in the hands of the Soviet army. Earlier, several divisions of the German army attacked, but the Soviet general in the area ordered a small team of Soviet troops to retreat, and then, with the help of artillery units placed on nearby mountains, drove the German army out of the peninsula. Soviet artillery units now control areas within several miles around. Soviet coastal artillery has also sunk several transport ships carrying German troops and supplies from Norway to Petsamo. The Soviet army on the Rybachy Peninsula has built elaborate underground defenses over the past few months and built military roads.</p>
<p>Moscow, TASS, 18th – A special correspondent for the Red Star newspaper said that the masses of the "Greater Germany" 384th and 8553rd Regiments, as well as the German 3rd Tank Division, were heavily damaged. After the Red Army began its counterattack, the "Greater Germany" 855th and 384th Divisions were the first to flee in panic. Although the German commander tried to stop them with machine guns, it was ineffective. After a few hours, the "Greater Germany Regiment" was also unable to hold on and retreated. However, not only on the Tula front, but also in other areas, the German army has begun to abandon their armor and flee. For example, a motorized infantry regiment of the German 212th Division abandoned its armor and fled for eleven kilometers. Although the German commander tried hard to stop them, they continued to race without stopping. In addition, similar acts of desertion occurred in various units of the German 19th and 31st Divisions. The Red Star newspaper's special correspondent inspected the southern suburbs of Tula the morning before yesterday and found a large number of German uniforms and food, which is enough to show the panic situation of the German army's escape.</p>
<h3>Another German Peace Offensive; Offers Truce to England; Otherwise, Will Request Passage Through Turkey and Spain</h3>
<p>England Decides to Attack Libya First</p>
<p>Ankara, United Press, 18th – The German Ambassador to Turkey, Papen, yesterday proposed a truce to England and warned that the Axis powers will eventually demand certain transit facilities from Turkey and Spain. The German Ambassador issued an order, recognizing that if England refuses the truce, the war will be very long. He said that the next step for Germany will be to drive the British out of the Mediterranean, and said that Turkey and Spain will still be strong countries in the east and west ends of the Mediterranean, exempt from special treatment. The result may be that they will require the supply of certain transit facilities and cooperation in the use of minerals. British and neutral observers regard the truce proposal as another stage of the German peace offensive, because Germany should have realized that England has no intention of slowing down its operations. However, it is believed that the proposal can confirm the widespread belief here that a war will occur in the Mediterranean and Middle East. It is widely believed in England that in the new war, England will first launch a major offensive against Libya, which now seems to be about to begin at any time. At the same time, it is expected that the German army will withdraw most of its troops from the Soviet Union, leaving a part of the army to make a final effort to seize Moscow and occupy the Caucasus to the mountain range before winter. Military experts do not believe that the German army can greatly reinforce, but the German air force will make important reinforcements. Military experts also believe that a large number of German troops should now be entering Bulgaria. The route of the German army's actions in the spring has been demonstrated in Papen's mentioned "transit facilities" and the Bulgarian politicians' declaration of war in the Bulgarian parliament, as well as the budget of more than two and a half million Bulgarian currency for the development of Bulgarian railways. If, as Papen predicted, Turkey will be exempted, then the German army may use Bulgarian seaports for maritime transport to the Caucasus and a major advance south through Iran. Regardless of which route the German army will use, it all depends on how successful and rapid the future Libyan war will be, so that the main manpower and material resources can be transferred to the north. Regarding the joint defense of the Caucasus, the only thing that can be confirmed at present is that this plan is already under consideration.</p>
<h3>Litvinov Arrives in Tehran</h3>

<h3>United States Prepares with All Its Might to Stop Coal Miners' Strike; Strike Situation Becomes Increasingly Tense; President Suspends Trip to Warm Springs</h3>
<p>Washington, Reuters, 18th – It is heard that President Roosevelt is prepared to restore coal production with all the power of the government. According to people close to the White House, the President now believes that the time has come for the government to implement a strong policy against all strikes that hinder national defense production. According to reliable sources, the President can no longer be patient and is prepared to deal a major blow to the President of the Mine Workers Union, Lewis, or anyone else who hinders national defense production. Major steel companies have announced that they will try to get all miners to work, hoping that their employees will do their best to produce coal for national defense. According to sources in the House of Representatives lounge, President Roosevelt approves of the concepts contained in the first part of the strike control bill to be discussed by the House next week, which stipulates that strikes will be prohibited unless a majority of workers vote in favor under government supervision. Some members believe that if the coal miners' strike is not resolved quickly, the President will send a message to Congress recommending the enactment of laws based on the above principles, and it is believed that if this law is passed, it will also prohibit sympathy strikes. At the same time, according to Evans, a member of the executive committee of the Industrial Organization and Mine Workers Union's Second District, the miners of various mines in North Cambria Town, Pennsylvania, about 75 percent, have voted in favor of taking the same action today in sympathy with the striking mines. The union members in the district are estimated to be about 10,000.</p>
<p>Washington, Reuters, 18th – In addition to the coal miners of the steel companies, at least 15 other coal mines also had sympathy strikes yesterday, causing the labor unrest to become increasingly tense. At the same time, important Democratic members of Congress, because the labor unrest is hindering national defense, are eager to find a way to stop the strike as soon as possible. Cox, Chairman of the House Rules Committee, has asked Congress to immediately compile the necessary legislation to deal with this situation, and not wait until the coal mine dispute is resolved. Speaker of the House Rayburn also said that the House should try to debate legislation with appropriate considerations as soon as possible. Although the coal mines of the steel companies claim to be on full strike, some of the 53,000 miners still come to work, which the union pickets cannot stop. President Lewis of the Mine Workers Union sent a letter to the President yesterday, saying that the union would never accept the contract of the steel company's coal mine being opened as a factory, because this contract would invalidate all other bituminous coal industry contracts. The policy committee of the Mine Workers Union applauded when Lewis said that the union was fighting the steel companies, not resisting the government. Lewis also said that Fuller, manager of US Steel, and Pinar, manager of Youngstown Steel, were both prepared to sign a "union factory" contract, stipulating that all miners who have not joined the union must join the union after the probationary period, but Grace, President of Bethlehem Steel, strongly opposed it. Fuller, Pinar, and Grace met with the President at the White House yesterday for an hour and refuted Lewis's statement to reporters that their opinions differed, saying that they agreed on the "union factory" on two points and that they would prepare a report and submit it to the President. The Industrial Organization Congress met in Detroit yesterday and unanimously passed a resolution proposed by the council to fully support the Mine Workers Union's actions in the non-union coal mine dispute.</p>
<p>Washington, Reuters, 18th – According to official sources, President Roosevelt has canceled his trip to Warm Springs on November 20 because of busy official duties and the tense coal miners' strike.</p>
<h3>Renowned German Air Force General Killed in Crash; Accident During Aircraft Testing</h3>
<p>Berlin, Reuters, 18th – Lieutenant General Udet of the German Air Force, who served as the director of the German Air Force Technical Department, passed away yesterday due to serious injuries sustained while testing a new weapon (aircraft). The Führer Hitler has ordered the naming of the 3rd Fighter Wing as the "Lieutenant General Udet Fighter Wing" to show his respect. Udet was born in Frankfurt, Germany on April 26, 1896. He was an air force officer during the last World War. From 1914 to 1918, he shot down 62 enemy aircraft. In 1922, Udet organized an aircraft manufacturing plant in Munich. Four years later, it expanded into the famous "Udet Factory" in Augsburg. He participated in several international air races and was consistently recognized as the world's first-class aviator.</p>
<h3>British Organizing Supply Route to Soviet Union; Via Baluchistan and Iran, Direct to Trucks for Second Run</h3>
<p>New Delhi, Reuters, 18th – The British are organizing a supply route from India, via Baluchistan and eastern Iran, directly to the Soviet Union, and establishing another connection to the Soviet Union. A truck has been test-driven on this route, carrying jute, which the Soviet Union urgently needs. The results of the first journey have yielded valuable information about the desolation and aridity of the 750-mile countryside between Baluchistan and Iran. Now the truck will carry resin for a second test run on this route. After being shipped to the United States, it is hoped that a system of scheduled truck runs on this route with few obstacles can be formulated. The Persian Auxiliary Transport Team has now been formed and is managed by experienced military officers and staff. The team has a large number of trucks from India, driven by Indian civilian drivers. There are currently 5,000 laborers improving the road surface, and this number is expected to increase to 8,000 soon. The Persian government is cooperating with the transportation on this route, such as canceling certain customs procedures and assisting in protecting the route to prevent bandits from looting trucks. The war equipment and raw materials supplied by the United States are now being transported to the Soviet Union via the Caspian Sea coast and various unloading yards in the Caucasus, and their quantity will soon increase dramatically. At the ports in the Persian Gulf, such as Basra, supplies from Australia, the United States, Britain, and India are constantly arriving and being transported overland to a number of locations in northern Iran, where they are received by Soviet transport agencies and transported into the Soviet Union. Railway locomotives and railway personnel supplied by India and other places are being transported to Iran to increase the maximum traffic volume on the railway line from the Persian Gulf, through Iran, to the Caspian Sea. It is hoped that the number of military trips on this line per day will triple by the end of this month. Indian contractors have been tasked with developing port facilities in Iran. Basra, which was once the back door of the Near East, is now the front door of Turkey and the Soviet Union. Supplies from this modern port are transported north by rail and road. British commercial companies have now provided more trucks than are currently needed for transportation on Iranian highways and have ordered more trucks to meet their needs.</p>
<p>Ottawa, Reuters, 18th – The Canadian Bureau of Statistics revealed that war supplies worth a total of 1.89 million yuan were shipped to the Soviet Union in October.</p>
<h3>American Catholic Priests Fully Support National Defense</h3>

<h3>Fourth Regiment About to Leave Shanghai; Will Not Return to Station in China; US Has Declared Post-War Abandonment of Extraterritorial Rights; Transfer of Defense to Be Decided Before Departure</h3>
<p>There have been widespread rumors about the US liner repeating its voyage to Shanghai. According to authoritative sources in the foreign shipping industry, one President liner each is expected to arrive in Shanghai around Friday of this week and Monday of next week. The two mail ships will not stay in Shanghai for long and will return to the US soon. It is also learned that British women and children are also evacuating Shanghai. The British Embassy has designated the ships of Jardine Matheson to leave Shanghai for Singapore and transfer to Australia. A British official said yesterday morning that the latest evacuation notice issued by the British Consulate-General in Shanghai to the British community in the city last week has seen many women and children registered for evacuation. The registration deadline was last Saturday. In the last two days of the deadline, the number of British nationals who went to the British Consulate's evacuation office to register increased sharply. According to the news that the US military will indeed leave Shanghai, it was also spread on Friday and Saturday of last week.</p>
<h3>Transfer of Defense to Be Decided Within Week</h3>
<p>The US Navy Fourth Regiment is ready to depart. The question of who will take over the defense of Area C that it leaves behind was discussed at a special meeting convened by the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, in which Japanese directors also participated. The heads of the various defense forces in the city will hold an important meeting soon to decide who will take over the US military defense zone after the withdrawal of the US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment. This is a matter of greatest concern to Chinese and foreign residents in the US military defense zone, and will be decided by the heads of the US, Italian, and Japanese defense forces stationed in Shanghai and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. Since the authorities have recognized that next Tuesday or so is the date of the US military's withdrawal, this meeting is expected to be held in the latter half of this week or at the end of the week. As for whether the Japanese authorities intend to take over the US military defense zone, as they did when they took over the Western District after the British army withdrew last year, public speculation is rampant. The Japanese side does not formally express its attitude. An official said, "No one knows what the Japanese intend, or it may not be known until the meeting is held." However, according to qualified sources, they heard that the Japanese wanted to patrol the US military defense zone and would raise this wish at the upcoming meeting. Non-Japanese people want to keep the US military defense zone exclusively under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Police, because the police department's ability is sufficient to take on this role. The Shanghai Municipal Council hopes that the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will take over the US military defense zone. The Corps is a civic group that is currently patrolling and stationed in Area "B". Whether it can be transferred to defend Area C as well needs to be carefully considered.</p>
<h3>Will Not Return After Withdrawal</h3>
<p>Colonel Howard, commander of the US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment, met with reporters the day before yesterday afternoon and said that since the US government has declared its intention to abandon extraterritorial rights in China when peace is restored, the US Marine Corps may not return to China. Judging from the China policy that Washington has already announced, unless the Chinese government feels that it is not able to protect American interests when normality is restored and asks the United States to send troops, the US military will return to China to perform garrison duties.</p>
<h3>Colonel Howard's Farewell Remarks</h3>
<p>Colonel Howard also enthusiastically praised the spirit of cooperation and goodwill from all parties that he felt during his seven months in Shanghai, saying that he will regret leaving Shanghai, and all the officers and soldiers under his command feel the same way. During his command of the US military Fourth Regiment in Shanghai, the spirit of cooperation between the various defense forces was extremely strong. His policy was to work as closely as possible to maintain the peace and security of the entire International Settlement. This policy was not only applied to the defense forces within the settlement, but also to the Japanese army and gendarmerie outside the settlement. Although the Fourth Regiment may not return to China, the formation of the regiment has been for 25 years. Not only will it not be disbanded as a result, but it may even increase the number of soldiers to about 2,000.</p>
<h3>Commemorating the Second Air Defense Day</h3>
<p>November 21 is China's Air Defense Day, and the second anniversary has arrived. Various places in the rear area are enthusiastically celebrating as in previous years, and consoling and providing relief to compatriots who have been victims of air raids, and strengthening air defense facilities. This city has decided not to hold any ceremonies due to its special environment. However, people with a sense of justice will automatically donate money and fulfill their responsibilities. At the same time, all sectors have decided to stand in silence in their original positions at noon on this day to mourn the national anti-air war martyrs and compatriots killed in air raids to express their condolences.</p>

<h3>American Thanksgiving Tomorrow; All American Nationals in Shanghai Celebrate; President Roosevelt Issues Proclamation Saying Opposition to Threatening Aggressive Forces is Increasing</h3>
<p>All American nationals celebrate Thanksgiving. It was originally scheduled to be held on the 27th of this month, but the US Consulate-General in this city received an order from Washington yesterday to advance it by one week to be held tomorrow. Therefore, the various American community groups in this city are preparing on a large scale. All American nationals in Shanghai have been notified to participate in the celebration together tomorrow.

<p>President Roosevelt's Thanksgiving Proclamation</p>
<p>The following is a translation of President Roosevelt's proclamation regarding Thanksgiving: "I, the President, hereby proclaim November 20th of this year as a day to thank God for the abundant grace bestowed upon us. Our beloved country is free and strong. Our opposition to threatening aggressive moral and material defense forces is increasing in scope and efficiency. In order to protect its own future interests, our people are vigorously supporting national defense. We are helping people abroad resist cruelty and bravely defend their country and precious freedom. We have not lost faith in the dignity of the human spirit. We firmly believe in the right of mankind to live in freedom and equality, and the enthusiasm for democracy is burning brightly in our hearts. Thank God for the endless blessings given to us in daily public and private affairs. We should also write books to be rich in the opportunity to serve the people. Thank God for blessing our determination to resist the violence of evil and slavery and protect our way of life. On this day of Thanksgiving, we should worship the true goodness of God, express our heartfelt gratitude, and pray that the chaos will end soon and that eternal freedom, fraternity, and justice will be established. In order to show good faith, I, the President, personally affix the seal of the United States to the end of the document, on the eighth day of November, one thousand nine hundred and forty-one, the one hundred and sixty-sixth year of American independence, in Washington," (Signed by President Roosevelt, countersigned by Secretary of State Hull.)</p>

<h3>When Using Bank of China Ten Yuan Notes, Check Carefully for Forgeries</h3>
<p>Recently, a large number of forged 10-yuan banknotes of the Bank of China, printed in 1937 by the Ronan Luo Company, have been discovered. The difference between the forgeries and genuine notes lies in the clarity of the "portrait" lines on the front; the lines on the forgeries are thick and messy. Also, the circular colored pattern behind the centrally located characters "拾元" (Ten Yuan) is duller in color on the forgeries. On the back, the characters "中國銀行" (Bank of China) on the Bank of China Building are reversed in the forgeries but clear on genuine notes. The oval-shaped watermark "天壇圖" (Temple of Heaven) is visible when held up to the light on genuine notes, but visible externally on the forgeries. The police are paying close attention to these forgeries, and merchants and citizens should be vigilant.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Concert</h3>

Ticket prices are six yuan, five yuan, three yuan, and two yuan.

<h3>Exchange Equalization Board Announces Measures for Providing Commercial Foreign Exchange: Legitimate Commercial Drafts Not Yet Settled Can Also Be Approved at the Fixed Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>The Exchange Equalization Fund Committee has recently announced measures for providing the foreign exchange needed for commercial purposes. It has notified the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the China Agricultural Bank, and the Fourth Bank to provide foreign exchange at the fixed exchange rates set by the Fund Committee: US$5.329 and British £3.325 to meet commercial needs, in order to increase supplies and stabilize prices. The original text of the eleven articles of the measures is as follows:</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange to Be Provided to the Greatest Extent Possible for Approved Commodities</p>
<p>Beginning September 15, 1941, for banks holding General Licenses No. 60 and No. 61 from the United States Treasury Department, the Fund will sell US dollars needed to import approved commodities into Free China (including freight and insurance) at the exchange rate of US$5.3211 per dollar. However, the sale of these US dollars must comply with the provisions of Section 2 of General License No. 61 of the United States Treasury Department. From September 15, 1941, for banks specially authorized by the Chinese Ministry of Finance, the Fund will sell British pounds needed to import approved commodities into Free China (including freight and insurance) at the exchange rate of £3.163. However, these imported goods must originate from the Sterling Area, and the recipient of this foreign exchange must be a resident of the Sterling Area. The selling price of foreign exchange by these licensed or authorized banks shall be US$5.329 and £3.325, and the buying price of foreign exchange shall be US$5.3211 and £1.2163.</p>
<p>Separate Provisions for Application Methods</p>
<p>Importers needing US dollars or British pounds for foreign exchange should complete an application form at the authorized bank, which will forward it to the General Office of the Fund in Chongqing, or the Hong Kong Office of the Fund, or the Fund's designated agencies in Free China, as well as agencies yet to be designated. Importers applying for foreign exchange must complete the application form according to the Fund's prescribed form. The banks are responsible for verifying that the information provided in the application form is detailed and accurate before forwarding it to the Fund for processing. Foreign exchange required for items listed in the list of prohibited imports announced by the Chinese Customs on July 4, 1939, and subsequent amendments and supplements, will not be approved, even with the approval of the Chinese government. (A) To facilitate the import of small-value commodities not on the prohibited import list, the Fund authorizes the banks to sell this foreign exchange, provided that the amount of each transaction does not exceed US$2,000 or £500. The banks must verify that the nature of these imported goods is truly legitimate. If the Fund inquires about a specific case, the bank should investigate and report the details of the case. (B) For individual needs such as remittances, travel expenses, insurance fees, etc., the Fund may approve the necessary foreign exchange required by any individual or family each month, but it will not exceed US$100 or £50. Additional needs may also be approved after verification. (C) The banks shall report the nature and amount of foreign exchange sold under items (A) and (B) above to the Fund weekly, according to the prescribed form.</p>
<p>Discretionary Provision of Foreign Exchange for Previously Concluded Contracts</p>
<p>A. The Fund may also discretionarily handle cases where legitimate commercial foreign exchange has been contracted before September 15, 1941, but has not yet been obtained in any way, especially those that have already been applied for or reported. B. The Fund may also discretionarily provide foreign exchange required for notes maturing on or after September 15, 1941, that have not yet been settled. However, this foreign exchange should be calculated after deducting the deposit already paid by the bank or importer. The banks shall trade at the US dollar and British pound exchange rates stipulated in this notice and shall not directly or indirectly use other exchange rates. A. If the banks purchase any foreign exchange on the market for the Fund, such as export drafts, checks, banknotes, coins, etc., they should do so at the prescribed prices of US$5.3211 or £3.32163, respectively, and report these transactions to the Fund weekly for verification. B. Applicants who have purchased foreign exchange from the Fund should sell any foreign exchange they have purchased on the market to the banks. Failure to comply will result in the Fund no longer approving the applicant's required foreign exchange. Importers must pay in cash when purchasing foreign exchange. Before selling foreign exchange, the banks should first verify whether the import procedures for goods being imported into Free China have been completed. Any foreign exchange obtained for legitimate purposes, whether used in full or in part, should be returned to the Fund at the original purchase price. For all cases of applications for US dollars or British pounds handled by the banks, after approval by the Fund, the banks should report the amount of national currency equivalent deposited by the applicant at any of the four banks to the Fund's Hong Kong office in the prescribed format for verification.</p>

<h3>Confident in Providing Food for the Entire City: 600,000 Bags of Stored Rice to Be Available; Rice Arriving After April to Be Stored</h3>
<p>According to those in charge at the Municipal Council, the authorities of the two concessions are now highly confident in suppressing rice prices and stabilizing the overall food supply in Shanghai. Currently, over 600,000 bags of stored foreign rice are being sold at cost in rice shops. In addition to the existing grain reserves in the market, this is sufficient to last until February of next year. During these four months, the Rice Management Committee will ship in 250,000 bags of foreign rice monthly. In addition to supplying some of it to rice shops for retail sale, the rest will be stored for future needs. Therefore, citizens should not worry about the future of the food supply, but should not buy too much at once, so as not to reduce the available stock, otherwise they will easily fall into the trap of unscrupulous rice merchants.</p>
<p>Transport Permits Expired</p>
<p>Rice shops in the Public Concession that are short of rice have been ordered by the Rice Management Committee to start selling stored high-quality foreign rice from the 17th of this month, priced at 158.95 yuan per bag (224 pounds). Although each bag requires a payment of 160 yuan, the balance of 1.05 yuan per bag can be claimed from the original payment location the next day. Also, the validity date of the 198 transport permits used on the 17th has expired yesterday. All those with these permits must return them to the guild today and are not allowed to continue using them.</p>
<p>Rice Industry Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Guild and the Miscellaneous Grain Industry Guild will hold their fourth temporary emergency meeting at 10 AM today on the third floor of the Miscellaneous Grain Guild at 15 Edward Road to improve the sale of stored foreign rice by rice shops. Issues such as the sale of stored rice by rice shops and payment of rice funds will be discussed. The Shanghai Rice Shop Industry Guild held a meeting yesterday afternoon, but the specific decisions made must be agreed upon by the Bean and Rice and Miscellaneous Grain guilds before they can be implemented.</p>
<p>Urgent Reporting of Rice Reserves</p>
<p>The Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that the registration of rice reserves exceeding one month's worth of needs with the bureau, as stated in Public Notice No. 5587, is still in effect. Those who have delayed should register with the bureau immediately and without further delay. Registration forms can be obtained from the Grain Committee, Office No. 167 of the Municipal Council's General Office. Hotels, restaurants, and businesses should pay particular attention to this matter.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Employees' Living Allowance Approved</h3>
<p>According to a public notice from the Municipal Council's Information Office, the temporary living allowance for November, issued to employees of the bureau, has been approved as follows:</p>
<p>For Chinese employees without contracts, an allowance of 260% will be issued for the first 200 yuan of their monthly salary, and 220% for the remaining portion. The minimum allowance is set at 66 yuan. Rice subsidies will continue to be issued as usual.</p>
<p>For foreign employees and Chinese employees with contracts, an allowance of 260% will be issued for the first 500 yuan of their monthly salary, 220% for the next 500 yuan, and 170% for the remaining portion.</p>
<p>In addition, for married male employees with contracts whose monthly salary is 700 yuan or less, a marriage allowance of 20% will be added (minimum 100 yuan). For those with a monthly salary above 700 yuan but not exceeding 1250 yuan, a child allowance will be added, calculated at 50 yuan per child per month (maximum 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>A Business on Avenue Foch Receives a Hand Grenade</h3>
<p>At around 3:30 PM yesterday, a person carrying a basket of fruit went to give a gift to the Yingji Business on Avenue Foch, Lane 197, No. 4 in the French Concession. Unexpectedly, after the person left, a cigarette tin was found inside, containing a hand grenade. Fortunately, it did not explode. The business reported the matter to the French police, who ordered detectives to take the grenade away for destruction.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping of Zhang Wenjun, Manager of Luen Wo Real Estate Company: Escaped After Being Kidnapped in Front of the Yangtze Hotel the Night Before and Encountering Japanese Troops in the Countryside</h3>
<p>A kidnapping case occurred the night before (the 17th) at the intersection of Hankou Road and Yunnan Road in the Public Concession. At the time, no one knew about it, and the police did not receive a report. It was not until yesterday that the kidnapped person escaped and revealed the incident to the outside world. The following is an investigation by the reporter of this newspaper:</p>
<p>Owns a Car and Drives Himself</p>
<p>Zhang Wenjun, a 38-year-old from Wuxi, lives at 523 Hart Road in the Public Concession. He works as the manager of the Luen Wo Real Estate Company at No. 412 on the fourth floor of the Shenda Building at 89 Fuzhou Road. The company was established by the wealthy Zhang family of Nanxun. Zhang usually drives his own car, No. 929, for the convenience of his work.</p>
<p>Kidnapped Suddenly at the Hotel Entrance</p>
<p>At around 9 PM the night before, Zhang left a friend's place in a certain number of the Yangtze Hotel at the intersection of Hankou Road and Yunnan Road. As he stepped out the door and was about to get into his car, three kidnappers suddenly jumped out from behind him. Two were wearing long robes, and one was wearing a Western suit. They pulled out two guns and threatened him not to make a sound. He was forced into the car, which was driven west by one of the kidnappers. When they reached the Tianqiao (Overpass) at Xujiahui, they stopped the car and got out.</p>
<p>Taken to a Farmer's House for the Night</p>
<p>Zhang was held by two kidnappers as they crossed the wire fence and entered the Chinese territory. At the same time, he saw his own car speeding away, driven by the kidnapper, to an unknown destination. At around 11 PM that night, in the pouring rain, Zhang was taken by the kidnappers to a village near Jinji Bridge and spent the night in a thatched house. The next morning, the two kidnappers urged Zhang to get up and questioned him about whether he was a member of the Zhang family of Nanxun. Zhang stated that he was from Wuxi, but the kidnappers did not believe him.</p>
<p>Escaped near Caojia Garden</p>
<p>At around 8 AM, one of the kidnappers walked with Zhang towards Caojia Garden in Caohaijing, holding a gun. Zhang saw that the kidnapper's gun was hidden behind his waistband and planned to escape. Soon after, they saw two Japanese soldiers patrolling and shouted for help. The soldiers arrested the kidnapper and took him and the victim to their headquarters. Zhang was finally safe. It is reported that the arrested kidnapper's name is Fang Xuxian, 26 years old, from Nanhui, and he claimed that the case was instigated by a fugitive named Mo. Zhang has now safely returned home, but the whereabouts of the missing car are still unknown.</p>
<h3>Investigation into the Fratricide Case Yesterday: Xu Daquan Remains Silent</h3>
<p>The French police conducted a public investigation yesterday morning at 9:30 AM into the tragic death of Xu Songyao, the young owner of the Huamei Pharmacy, with the main suspect, the murderer Xu Daquan, brought to the court. Xu was still wearing a grey wool-lined long robe and looked even thinner than the last time he was seen. However, he remained manic and incoherent, silent throughout, and did not say a word. He was then asked to sit down and instructed to write, but Xu held the brush for about half an hour without being able to write a single character. When the axe he used to commit the crime was shown to him, he showed no reaction and did not take it. It is said that since Xu was arrested and detained by the police, although he eats and drinks as usual, he has remained silent and unable to speak. Therefore, the investigation yesterday could not proceed. It has now been rescheduled to the 2nd of next month. Xu Daquan will be returned to police custody. As for Xu's father, Xu Xiangsun, and Bao Tan Lu Zanyuan, Tan Mu Xu Kaitao, and the photographer of fingerprints Chen Zixin (known as Lao Guangdong), and Miao Xiangjia, the secretary of Tongren Fuyuantang, who are suspected of being involved in the case, were all arrested by the police for investigation. Among them, Xu Kaitao has been released as he is not suspected of any crime. The rest of the people</p>
<p>Public Investigation</p>
<p>But Xu Xiangsun was suffering from hemoptysis and was specially approved by the police to be transferred to Wang Qizhang Sanatorium for treatment. He was not present yesterday. According to the police investigation, since the case occurred, it was found that there were illegal activities involving false identification during the examination of the corpse, so the police immediately started investigating. First, they sent Western detectives to Baolong Hospital to investigate, and only then did they learn that Xu Songyao's body was indeed not sent to Tongren Fuyuantang for examination. And this matter was entirely done by Zhong Bingchang, a police officer of No. 152 who is on the run, and Lu Zanyuan, a police officer of No. 193 who was arrested.</p>
<p>One-Handedly</p>
<p>Later, because the family of the deceased Xu Songyao requested the police to waive the examination, the police refused, and the two detectives came up with the means of replacing the corpse with a nameless male corpse that had died on the road, pretending to be Xu Songyao's body. On the one hand, they colluded with Chen Zixin, the fingerprint photographer, and Miao, the secretary of Tongren Fuyuantang, to help commit fraud, so that the corpse examination was completely concealed. It is said that Xu Xiangsun gave a huge bribe at that time, so now the police are prosecuting Xu Xiangsun for concealing and destroying evidence and using bribery. And because Xu was absent without reason today, he will be arrested again.</p>
<p>Add to Detention</p>
<p>Re-detained in the police station for investigation at any time, it is said, as for the detective Lu Zanyuan, and Chen Zixin, Miao Xiangjia, the police have been accused of freezing their jobs, and according to Miao Xiangjia, this matter was completely entrusted by the detective Zhong Bingchang, helping to fill in the body form, at that time, he did not know that Xu's body was a false one, and he did not receive any bribes. Chen Zixin confessed that on the morning of October 27, he was sent by the police to Tongren Fuyuantang to take photos of the corpse examination. When he arrived, Zhong Bingchang asked to waive the photo of Xu Songyao's body, which I refused. Zhong then moved Xu Jingyao's corpse and the car driver's corpse from the mortuary and placed them together, and I took the photos back.</p>
<p>I Don't Know It's Fake</p>
<p>Finally, Zanyuan confessed that when investigating the case, it was originally Detective Xu Kaitao who sent Detective No. 179 to investigate. I was only helping to fill in an investigation report, and it was entirely based on the Bao Long Hospital's injury report that Xu Songyao fell to his death and the car driver Zheng Ali suffered from pulmonary hemorrhage and cerebral congestion. The next morning, I was sent to Fuyuantang to monitor the body, but I didn't know about the fake thing. As a result, because the investigation still needs to continue, it was rescheduled to October 2, and all the defendants were returned to the police station.</p>
<h3>Assassination Case on Avenue Lafayette Last Night: One Man Shot Dead</h3>
<p>An assassination case suddenly occurred at the foot of the iron gate wall of Sansan Village in Lane 1254, Avenue Lafayette, French Concession, at around 10:45 PM last night. The victim was a young man, whose name is unknown, about 30 years old, wearing blue western-style trousers. There were three or four murderers ambushing there. When they saw the victim arriving, they pulled out their guns and fired three or four shots. One bullet hit his chest, and one bullet pierced his brain, and he died on the spot. After the incident, the murderers fled to Zhangjia Lane behind without a trace. A certain Russian in No. 7 of the neighborhood suddenly heard the sound of gunfire and opened the window to investigate. He saw a Chinese youth being shot to death at the foot of the opposite wall, and then reported it to the French police by telephone, ordering Chinese and Western detectives to rush there, but the murderers were gone. They found the bullet shells at the scene of the incident and brought them back for investigation. At the same time, they used a hearse to transport the corpse to Guangci Hospital and transferred it to the small ward on Talas Road for examination. The police are investigating the cause of the assassination.</p>
<h3>Shanghai YMCA Appeals for Winter Clothing Donations</h3>
<p>In order to relieve the poor, the Shanghai YMCA has launched a fundraising campaign to make winter clothes and distribute them to the poor in the city. It is heard that the association has been actively raising donations. As of yesterday, donations from all walks of life have been enthusiastic, and the total amount has reached more than 9,000 yuan. However, the goal of 30,000 yuan is still far away, and the weather is gradually getting colder, and the poor women and children urgently need winter clothes and quilts, and they also hope that the philanthropists from all walks of life will donate as soon as possible so that the good deeds can be completed as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory predicted the weather at 4:30 PM yesterday, saying that there is tropical air in southeastern China, and Shandong is sunny and clear, with strong northwest winds turning sharp. Here, it will turn from sunny and warm to cloudy, with morning fog and south to west winds. The coastal area south of Ma'an Island will be sunny, with gentle southeast winds. There is a cyclone and rain in North Korea due to the low pressure passing east or northeast. Also, in the 14 hours before 3 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in Mupu was 79.9 and the lowest was 59.7. On the same day last year, the highest was 64.0 and the lowest was 41.8.</p>

All high school graduates or those with equivalent qualifications can apply. Enrollment will be conducted in Chengdu, Chongqing, Kunming, and Guilin across the country. Training will begin in Chengdu on New Year's Day next year. The number of places to be recruited this time will not be able to fulfill the wishes of all young people in the country, so in the future, we should strive to establish branches and sub-branches everywhere and hold various short-term training classes on the spot, such as summer training classes, so that a large number of young students can take advantage of their vacations to study and research, so that the gliding movement can be universally developed. The General Association has ordered 20 gliders in a certain place, and Guilin can be assigned several for backup in the future. Two or three of the first phase students will also be sent to Guilin to work soon. Regarding education, according to Instructor Wen Qijun, the second phase of courses is exactly the same as the first phase, but the learning period is extended by one month. The first phase is ten months of graduation, and the second month is designated as the enlistment period. In a more ample time, it is planned to enrich the content of each subject. Nine subjects have been set: Gliding Science (gliding principle, theory and technology), Navigation Science, Flight Rules, Insurance Umbrella (the above four subjects are to explain the methods and techniques that must be known during on-the-spot gliding), Instrument Science (studying the structure and device of instruments in the aircraft), Glider Science (teaching the reasons and methods of glider structure), Mechanical Drawing (using triangles and geometry to draw various patterns), Meteorology (studying the relationship between climate and navigation), Mechanical Practice (students actually learn to build gliders and learn to repair them).</p>

<h3>Introduction: Ding Guangxie Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Wu Yisheng</p>
<p>Mr. Ding Guangxie has held several personal exhibitions in the past, with scenery as the main theme. This year I came to Shanghai permanently, and it happened that I was fortunate enough to see his solo exhibition at the New Shanghai Company. After viewing it, I felt that Mr. Ding is not just a landscape painter, but also an explorer of the mysteries of nature, like a scientist. He sings the harmony and evolution of nature, but he is like a poet. In Mr. Ding's works, there is a strong pastoral sentiment, which is the characteristic of his landscape paintings. And his transparent sense of color and a kind of soft poetic charm from nature are the valuable artistic achievements of Mr. Ding.</p>
<p>This time, Mr. Ding's solo exhibition is of course mostly landscape paintings. Those more than one hundred harmonious, purified, and profound pictures are all records of the beauty and harmony that an artist has experienced in the life of nature. There is no pretense or deception, just like what Corot's paintings tell us.</p>
<p>The British writer Kingsley said, "Don't miss an opportunity to view any beauty." "Beauty" is God's great masterpiece. How should the poor people who are suffocating in a smoggy city for four years cherish this exhibition of Mr. Ding?</p>

<h3>Foreign Flour Is Reluctant to Sell Cheaply; Rice and Flour Sales Show Some Promise</h3>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Qingyuan Wheel and the Qiongzhou Jiaying Wheel arrived at the same day earlier. The large amount of foreign rice and sugar loaded on the Qiongzhou and Qingyuan Wheels has been reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that there are still 5,100 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, all of which are the Shanghai Municipal Council's cheap small rice. Yesterday, there was no market for foreign rice. Due to inconvenient transportation, domestic rice also lacked transactions in the market, except for a few embellishments.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Xigeng sent a letter to this newspaper saying that since the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession implemented the import rice price limit of 130 yuan per stone, the civilians of the isolated island have been clapping their hands and cheering, praising their merits. It is not easy to achieve this effect without the concerted efforts of the two Concession authorities. However, this matter is of great importance, and at the beginning of the process, there are many clues. Although it is inevitable that some places will be criticized, it is natural. However, this is not a disease for the authorities. It is generally believed that the cost of rice imported by the Shanghai Municipal Council is recently based on the foreign exchange obtained from the application, which is calculated at several yuan per unit. What price is the foreign exchange settled at? What price is the rice calculated at? According to the document submitted by the Bean and Grain Trade Association to the two Concession authorities, the cost of small rice settled at the statutory foreign exchange rate is 110 yuan. If the black market foreign exchange rate is used to calculate the cost of small rice, it will be more than 170 yuan. Also, the price of rice imported by the Shanghai Municipal Council has increased from 117 yuan to 130 yuan. Is this due to the high cost of water transportation? In the past, the Shanghai Municipal Council would announce the reasons for the price increase of imported rice, but this is not the case. And since the sale of foreign rice has been handled, I don't know how the profit and loss is. If there is a loss, how to raise funds to compensate? How to distribute the profit? This is also what the citizens are concerned about. Since the authorities announced that from November 15th, anyone who transports more than one bag of flour in the Public Concession or the French Concession will be punished without a permit from the authorities. Please apply to the authorities for a flour transportation permit, paying a fee of two cents per bag, in order to restrict the movement of flour inside and outside the boundary. I strongly agree. However, there are still some issues to be discussed regarding the application for permits. If flour merchants ship goods to flour mills or flour warehouses, the quantity is always more than one bag, so they must first obtain a permit for future reference. However, if the goods are delivered to the store, they cannot be sold out immediately in fact. If the initial permit has expired, and then a customer needs to buy more than one bag of flour, they must apply for a permit before delivery can be made. Calculated in this way, each bag of flour adds a permit fee of four cents. According to the principles of commodity sales, it will inevitably be added to the cost, and its ultimate goal is undoubtedly to pass it on to consumers. At a time when the authorities are reducing the burden on the common people, I think it is necessary to review it. Also, the permit for the movement of rice and grain within the boundary is not charged, while the movement of flour within the boundary requires a fee. It is already favoring one over the other, or is the flour already subject to customs duties or unified taxes of one cent per bag when it enters the warehouse and leaves the factory, which can proceed unimpeded? Then, there is a question as to whether there is a conflict between the Shanghai Municipal Council's need for a handling fee of one cent per bag. In short, benevolence and virtue are admirable. I stand purely and do not care about the rhetoric, with good intentions and hopes. Foreign flour is added to the market due to the actual consumption needs of this street. Some of the American flour that the foreign gangs are waiting to load has been certified by the authorities and can be declared and shipped. Therefore, people's hearts have turned to peace. Owners are no longer in a hurry to sell cheaply. American flour is about to arrive at the Pao Tai at a price of 4.1 yuan. Golden Dragon was initially very sluggish, but later, as American flour transferred stations, there was daily zeroing in this street, so it also sold for 37 to 38 yuan, with a total of one or two thousand bags traded. Wheat bran continued to rise, and small bags continued to sell for half a yuan.</p>
<h3>Wholesale of Yellow Beans Arrives; Oil Hoarders Revive</h3>
<p>Edible oil: Actual consumption households have slightly increased their purchases, and hoarding stomachs are also good, so the market trend has turned to rise. As a result, it has risen by more than ten yuan compared to the previous time. The city's accomplishments include 20 barrels of Dalian bean oil, 37 barrels of Jiangbei bean oil, 300 cans of raw oil, 200 cans of Yantai raw oil, nearly a thousand dan of Qingyou from the Dayou Factory, 500 dan of vegetable oil, and 300 barrels of vegetable oil from the Rihua Factory.</p>
<p>A considerable amount of yellow beans has arrived in the port recently, so the market trend has loosened. Yesterday, Chen Jinyuan from Tianjin was handled by this street and the Xiamen gang for 200 bags, and another 500 bags of Xinjinyuan, the price fell by three or four yuan compared to the previous time. Another 1,860 bags of beans and 5,360 bags of bean cake were shipped to Singapore.</p>
<h3>No Black Market Transactions; Japanese and American Notes Fall Together</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: the Central Bank and HSBC's listed prices were both flat, and the price of HSBC's small counter remained unchanged. The local exchange in the black market of British and American exchange in the black market still has no development. The British gold in New York is one pound and 125, and the US exchange is three yuan, still there is supply but no demand, and no transactions have been made.</p>
<p>Tianjin, 18th (Tuesday) Electric, this morning the market opened smoothly, and the telegraphic transfers of London and New York have not changed. Shen exchange fell by five corners, to seventy-seven yuan, and Lian banknote between disk up one yuan and five corners, to forty-seven yuan angle.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 18th (Tuesday) Electric, this morning the exchange market opened very steadily, and there is still no change.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market: British and American gold pounds continued to plummet by 20 yuan with the cash price, and the British gold bill was still flat. Although the US gold bill once fell to 32.5 yuan, it then returned to 33.2 yuan, only one corner less than the previous day. The trend of Hong Kong bills is still stable, and the market price is standing flat. The Japanese gold bill has fallen again, and the evening market has retreated to 3.25 yuan, while the Korean bill has risen, and the evening market has also risen to 3.25 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Situation Is Unfavorable for Gold; The Low Price Almost Breaks Through the 18,000 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash red market fell more and more miserably, and the price has fallen wildly into the 19,000 yuan mark, and several times it was dangerous to break through the 18,000 yuan mark again. All parties are still extremely weak. The US-Japan negotiations were beneficial to the sellers, and the Hong Kong Dajin and other gangs saw high and violently sold. Although the bank gangs continued to enter, Dafeng entered more than 500 taels, and Mingfeng Tianwu each entered about 400 taels, but Shi He Xianghe Qian Duiye each sold more than 500 taels. The price hovered and retreated from 19,790 yuan to a low price of 18,100 yuan in the afternoon. Although it was forcibly raised, the closing price continued to be 1,090 yuan lower. The total transaction volume for the day was 13,780 taels. Jewelry fell by 80 yuan, to 1,920 yuan. The secret market of silver fell to 23 yuan.</p>
<p>Hot Red Market with Light Rain</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened at 9:00 a.m. at 19,750 yuan, which is 50 yuan higher. After the opening, a selling wave suddenly rose, and the price plummeted. Shihe Yifeng Shunyuan Mingfeng Tianyuan Xianghe sold violently, and the price plummeted 1,250 yuan, entering the 19,000 yuan mark, falling to 18,500 yuan. Defu Dingcheng Decheng was seen absorbing, and Tianyuan Mingfeng re-entered, so a recovery wave started, and the step rose to 100 yuan, seeing 19,000 yuan. Yifeng Shihe Shunyuan Decheng Tianyuan moved in the selling wave, and the price fell sharply by 700 yuan again, falling to 18,300 yuan. At noon, Yongcheng Xianghe Tianjin raised it to 18,600 yuan, and Shunyuan Lianxing sold it out. The noon closing price was raised to 18,450 yuan. The opening price at 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon was 150 yuan lower, at 18,200 yuan. In the selling wave, it retreated to 18,100 yuan again. Tianyuan Shunyuan Dafeng vigorously raised, and the price rose sharply by 750 yuan, coaxing to 18,900 yuan. Xianghe sold it vigorously, and the closing price at 4:00 p.m. was 18,650 yuan, which was 1,050 yuan lower than the closing price on the previous day. It has been two days of light rain, with a total sharp drop of 2,650 yuan. There was a high and low of 1,650 yuan on the same day. The market price of the cash shop's own brand Jinmen was 19,000 yuan, and the purchase price was 1,000 yuan lower than the selling price.</p>
<h3>After the Splendor of Public Bonds, They Return to Mediocrity</h3>
<p>The public bond secret market yesterday rose sharply and returned slightly, showing a slight fatigue. This is also a necessary step. Probably because there was no news from the start of the US-Japan negotiations, most of the market participants were watching and waiting. Most of the transactions in the market were scalping in and out frequently. Type C also rushed out of the 70 yuan mark once, but it still broke in. The trend may be slightly hovering. In the morning yesterday, Jiufeng had a considerable buying interest, and Lianhe and Tongkang followed suit. Bingjie also raised to more than 70 yuan. However, Yuancheng and Runde sold out, and Baolong's spot even flowed out, breaking into the pass and even breaking nine yuan once. The noon closing price was half a yuan. In the afternoon, Jiufeng continued to buy, and Renfeng also had a need for Runde and Shilong to continue selling, and Lianhe turned out. Hu Heji also had sales requests, but customers continued to buy. The market price slightly recovered. The price results were slightly returned to two or three corners to six corners uniformly. The total transaction volume was about 2.3 million yuan. The following is a brief table:</p>
<p>Category Maximum Minimum Closing Compared to Previous Day Tongjia 76.10 5.50 75.60 Down 0.40 Tongyi 71.30 70.50 70.90 Again 0.2 Tongbing 70.10 Station 8.95 69.30 Again 0.30 Tongding 65.75 65.00 65.10 Again 0.60 Tongwu 69.40 68.00 68.65 Again 0.35</p>
<p>In stock trading, 60 shares of Tianchu MSG Factory were traded at a price of 365 yuan per share.</p>
<h3>The Multi-Party Is Hesitant and Does Not Move Forward; The Yarn Market Is Temporarily Quiet</h3>
<p>The yarn market is stable. This is because after a big up and down, the trend has turned to calm. The new sellers are because their bottom is low, and although the raw materials have also declined, the yarn prices now differ too much from the cost, and the factory not only cannot make a profit, but also loses money. Therefore, the excitement of the new shorts has been greatly reduced, so the yarn market has turned to quiet. However, some of them are still struggling on the short side, so the advance and retreat force is quite strong. The high price of 20 counts of Shuangma is 1,675 yuan, and the low price is 2,575 yuan.</p>
<p>Shuangma Morning Open, the market image is peaceful, at 2,600 yuan. After a while, it fell to 2,585 yuan, but there are quite a few people doing more. In a flash, it rose to 2,645 yuan. After hearing that the exchange opened flat, it saw a slight decline, and the market situation became tired again, gradually loosening to 2,575 yuan. Unexpectedly, at the closing of the third market, the exchange's yarn and cloth all rebounded, and people's hearts were greatly shaken. The shorts rose up to cover, and Shuangma gradually advanced to 2,675 yuan. However, the price was too high, and a batch of profitable people vomited it out, loosening to 2,610 yuan to close the market. The daytime turnover statistics were 2,950 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon opened at 2,610 yuan, "but the shorts on the floor were unusually active, once falling to 2,575 yuan. Later, after hearing that the exchange's yarn and cloth all rose, it rose to 2,635 yuan, loosening again to 2,605 yuan, but the closing price rose again to 2,632 yuan.</p>
<p>The situation of the Golden Shuangma futures market is exempt from ups and downs, and the trend is slightly firm in the hovering. After the return, there is still no significant development in the ring, so the buyer is hesitant and the potential for pulling up is weakening. The shorts are blocked by the news and are also more cautious. The market atmosphere rises and falls, and seems to be waiting for development in brewing. When the morning opened, the November period was 2,390 yuan. After the floating short's compensation, it once reached a high of 2,440 yuan, and then fell back to December. After opening at 2,500 yuan, it gradually rose, but it also reached 2,600 yuan. The forward first did 2,650 yuan, and later, after securities and gold gangs once acquired it, it rose to 2,715 yuan. After entering, retail investors handed it over one after another, and the trend softened again. The noon closing price was small to 2,360 yuan in the near term, 2,530 yuan in December, and 2,640 yuan in January. In the afternoon, the factory orders and the exchange were relatively firm, and people's hearts were stable. The intention to buy was strong, and the market price hovered firmly. The periods for each month saw a rebound. As a result of the ups and downs throughout the day, the near term rose by 15 yuan, the December period rose by 5 yuan, and the January period fell sharply by 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market Starts to Improve</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation has improved slightly. The price of coarse cotton has rebounded by 10 yuan, but the public is still unwilling to sell at an excessive loss and is still taking a wait-and-see attitude. Trading can also be prosperous. The following is a record of the fluctuations in the prices of each cotton in the flower number room yesterday:</p>
<p>Brazil 100 pieces 200.0 Warehouse Delivery</p>
<p>Brazil 200 pieces 275.0 Warehouse Delivery</p>
<p>Lan Palace 200 pieces 575.0 Warehouse Delivery</p>
<p>Lan Palace 100 pieces 560.0 Warehouse Delivery</p>
<p>Lan Palace 100 pieces 545.0 Warehouse Delivery</p>
<p>Lan Palace 100 pieces 540.0 Warehouse Delivery</p>
<p>New York Cotton Market: The market situation first fell due to the south gang's hedging and floating more selling, and then slightly rose due to New Orleans buying and the industry compensating. As a result, yesterday's closing price fell by about ten pounds.</p>
<h3>The Sugar Futures Market is Controlled, Business is Stalled Invisibly</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the spot sugar market continued to rise. October imports rose directly from 260 yuan to 272 yuan, then to 262 yuan, a rise of 13 yuan. September rose from 248 yuan to 270 yuan, then to 260 yuan. August rose from 250 yuan to 268 yuan, then to 256 yuan. The most recent November arrival started at 275 yuan, then 278 yuan, then 261 yuan. Hong Kong crude rose from 230 yuan to 239 yuan, a rise of 5 yuan. Dutch red rose from 210 yuan to 203 yuan, a rise of 3 yuan. By the afternoon, there was a possibility of the futures market opening, but due to control by a certain party, trading was not allowed below 272 yuan, causing all business to stall invisibly. Only over 5,000 bags of spot goods were traded in the morning.</p>
<h3>Fresh Fruit Arrives in Succession, Dried Fruit Also Has a Source</h3>
<p>Recently, the source of fresh fruit has been continuous. Since the listing of Huangyan Shantou mandarin oranges, early oranges from Dongting Mountain have also arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, the market price ranged from 180 yuan to about 200 yuan. There are also imported mandarin oranges with an asking price of about 200 yuan per 100 market pounds. However, the arrival of raw pears is not much, and the price has risen slightly, with an asking price of 270-280 yuan, and the base price being 140 yuan. The arrival of Xiamen pomelos is relatively abundant, and the price has weakened, with an asking price of 230 yuan. Banana arrivals are not strong, sales are smooth, and the price is very brisk, with an asking price of 230-240 yuan. The apple market is stable, with "Wa Jin" apples opening at 45-46 yuan per box, and "Guo Guang" apples at 57-58 yuan. There are also Jintai oranges that arrived yesterday, with an asking price of 120-130 yuan, which is 30-40% higher than last year's market price. In addition, Tianjin's new hawthorns are priced at 46-47 yuan per 100 pounds, which is still considered stable.</p>
<p>On the 18th, 910 bags of imported raw peanuts, 408 bags of walnuts, and 365 bags of chestnuts arrived, all from Tianjin.</p>

<h3>The Female Calamities of the Political and Legal Circles</h3>
<p>— Dan Xin</p>
<p>This newspaper's "European War Miscellany" has been publishing a translation of "The Female Calamities of the French Political Circle" for several days. What is described within truly makes one sigh endlessly. In fact, anyone who abandons their natural calling and only seeks the pleasures of sights, sounds, and hedonism is simply ruining themselves.</p>
<p>Liberal France has its glorious past and should also have its bright future. These "female calamity" phenomena are a clear example of "worrying about the country leads to prosperity, while indulging in pleasure leads to ruin." As long as they can bury themselves in hard work, this is still a beneficial lesson. The facts of the female calamities are such, but ultimately it should still be the men who blame themselves. Although food and sex are natural, men should strive for self-improvement.</p>
<p>Looking at the ladies of Shanghai, they indulge in dance halls and bars all day long. The times have already sent these dregs into the trash can, but these dregs are still content with life in the trash can and do not regret it. The result will only be eternal ruin. We hope that the Chinese youths who are intoxicated in pink dreams will immediately wake up, as they are not far off course. Do not embark on a path of self-destruction from which you cannot extricate yourselves.</p>
<p>The children of the times should aim to serve the masses. Today, many Chinese heroic sons and daughters are rising up for the national crisis to fulfill their mission of the times. Therefore, we are confident that the Chinese nation will be able to overcome any difficulties and cultivate our flowers of freedom and fruits of happiness.</p>
<h3>Such a Reputable Landlord—Demanding Rent Calculated in US Dollars?</h3>
<p>To the Honorable Editor: I am suffering greatly due to the unreasonable oppression of my landlord regarding the housing issue. I rented the current house on November 1st of last year from a Ningbo landlord, Mr. Ying (formerly a shipping merchant, a nouveau riche after the war, now specializing in real estate and hoarding due to the interruption of shipping) and using the name of Jin Di Real Estate Company. He lives upstairs in the connected rooms, three rooms in the front and back, and the rest are rented out to others. At that time, I rented a large and small room on the lower floor and a pavilion room upstairs, a total of three rooms of various sizes, for a monthly rent of 157 yuan, including water, electricity, and donations, for a term of six months. After the six-month term expired, he immediately demanded a rent increase of ten yuan, so I gave up the room upstairs and lived downstairs, the rent was not increased, but an additional electricity fee of three yuan was added, making the monthly rent 160 yuan. That room upstairs was soon rented out for a monthly rent of 60 yuan. Moreover, this time he only allowed a term of three months. After the term expired, he increased the rent by 30 yuan again, making it 190 yuan, and still only allowed a term of three months. Because it was difficult to find a house, and it always required tips, and my children were all working and studying nearby, I reluctantly agreed to the increase. By the end of this month, the term will expire again, and he notified me a few days ago that he would increase the rent by 110 yuan per month, making the total monthly rent a huge 300 yuan. When I immediately asked for the reason for the rent increase, he said it was calculated based on the black market US dollar exchange rate, and said that if I did not move out after the term expired, he would calculate according to the new rent. I am a retired bank employee, unable to work due to illness, and my daily life depends entirely on pensions and a small amount of savings from before the war, which is already very difficult, how can I withstand such an increase in expenses? Moreover, after the fall of Yuan Lai (Wujin), all my houses and utensils were mostly destroyed, and I am already homeless. I have never argued with anyone, I don't know if I can refuse this unreasonable rent increase. After the term expires, will there still be a deadline for moving out? The other tenants living together also feel the same way. The landlord receives more than 800 yuan per month in rent for the entire building, and the expenses are only water and electricity bills, housing donations, and a small amount of repair costs. At this time of national crisis, we should be in the same boat and overcome this difficulty together. As fellow countrymen, we should not use the US dollar as an excuse to increase the rent. Unexpectedly, he has repeatedly increased the rent, but still cannot satisfy his desires. I have always admired your newspaper for upholding justice and serving society. I would like to borrow a corner to make this situation public to the masses. With respect, Li Zhenzhi.</p>
<p>Editor's note: This kind of landlord is greedy and unreasonable beyond words, truly deserving of condemnation. As a fellow countryman, he does not think about being in the same boat through thick and thin, but wants to squeeze people to the point of desperation with the houses obtained from profiting from the national crisis. Considering the law and human feelings, how can this be fair? For now, as long as the tenants are united, go through legal procedures, formally question him in writing, and provide evidence to point out the relationship between the real estate company and the landlord, let's see if he still has the face to settle in foreign exchange? Now the prices of bread, milk powder, gasoline, and soap, all daily necessities, electricity bills, and land donations are falling, what reason is there for the rent to rise alone? The three-month lease term is a mere threat that everyone knows. This should also be argued and canceled during serious negotiations. Finally, if he ignores it, you can sue the authorities.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Renting Out Kitchens</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lai</p>
<p>Since Shanghai became an isolated island, due to the surge in population, there has been a shortage of houses. Generally, second landlords take the opportunity to make profits, dividing the houses horizontally and vertically, turning them into pigeon coop style; it seems that the purpose of living is just to sleep, and everything else besides sleeping, such as washing, drying, and cooking, is not needed at all. Single or double-story lane houses usually only have one tap, and when more people live there, they grab and snatch from each other, making it unbearable in the first half of the day; the roof and the patio are covered with houses and awnings, and there is no place to dry clothes; the rooms are as small as snail shells, with some of the simplest furniture, and if you want to take a few steps, you will be like a ram trapped in a fence, unable to move forward or backward. As for cooking, most of the kitchens are rented out, and residents have to burn kerosene stoves and coal stoves in their rooms. Therefore, fires in the concession occur frequently. Burning down the house is not the only problem, because of the stacked beds and houses, it is difficult to escape, and people are often burned to death.</p>
<p>The concession authorities prohibit the construction of houses on the roof (but in fact, many are still built), and there have also been discussions about prohibiting the construction of lofts, but there has been no prohibition on renting out kitchens, which is a major oversight. The kitchen is originally a place for cooking, so the buildings are mostly walls, which are not easy to burn; and the water pipe is close at hand, so even if you are careless, it is easy to extinguish. The rooms are full of boxes, wardrobes, and many board walls, lofts, and if you are not careful, it will become a prairie fire; and it is inconvenient to fetch water, often causing a disaster due to the failure to rescue in time. Now the concession authorities are strictly prohibiting the hoarding of flammable materials to prevent fires, which is indeed a good policy. I hope that at the same time, the greedy second landlords will also be curbed, prohibiting them from renting out rooms to tenants without restriction, and renting out the kitchen to make profits!

<h3>Roadside Report</h3>
<p>— Inspector</p>
<p>On Beile Road in the French Concession, there is a certain business that usually keeps its doors tightly closed, seemingly deserted. Recently, the front of the business has been crowded with people, which suddenly looks lively. It turns out that the business is selling the rice it hoarded before at a flat price, hence this scene. Several slogans are posted in front of the business. One on the left reads: "Haha! We are going to sell flat-priced rice!" The tone is quite novel and imposing; the word "haha" can better convey the spirit.</p>
<h3>A Record of Buying Milk Powder</h3>
<p>— Jue Min</p>
<p>My younger brother is sick. According to the doctor, it is the result of insufficient nutrition and needs to be supplemented with milk.</p>
<p>Today, I happened to see the news that "Jishi Foreign Company stipulates that Klining milk powder is 70 yuan per 5-pound can." I thought about it for a long time and felt that I could barely afford it. After getting off work, I went to the accounting department to withdraw 70 silver dollars and wanted to buy a can to try. I knew that after walking through all the major companies and pharmacies, they all unanimously replied "no." The strangest thing is that a certain pharmacy even asked for 70 yuan for a 2.5-pound can. Only China-France Pharmacy was able to abide by the price limit and once sold me a bottle for 70 yuan, but it had to be opened on the spot to prevent hoarding. According to the clerk in the store, "If we sell it to hoarders without opening it, we can get 120 yuan, but for the sake of commercial ethics, China-France does not adopt this method." No wonder the previous few companies were unwilling to sell it to me.</p>
<p>The spirit of China-France Pharmacy in abiding by the law and standing out from the crowd is truly worthy of our praise. Finally, I hope that all sectors will introduce the cheapest stores and expose stores that do not follow the price limit. The wave of rising prices can always be alleviated a little bit.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Fourteen, The Hero's Life of Fighting</p>
<p>That night, he had to tell the head martial arts actor of the Red Stage what Xiao Jiqing had told him on the first day, and how those martial arts actors had been playing tricks on Begonia these past three days. He knew that this person was very experienced and had considerable influence in Shanghai. Zhang Yincai, who was usually so fierce, could not help but bow his head when he saw him. As long as he was willing to say a word, this misunderstanding could be resolved immediately, and Begonia would no longer have to suffer so much idleness.</p>
<p>After listening to the words of the martial arts manager, that person was indeed very dissatisfied, and when the show ended that night, he really reprimanded Zhang Yincai a few words.</p>
<p>Only then did Zhang Yincai understand that Begonia was introduced by the small boss, and he could not help but regret it a bit. From then on, he treated Begonia much more kindly; not to mention the martial arts actors under him, who were all acting according to his demeanor. When he became kind to Begonia, others would no longer insult him.</p>
<p>However, this only resolved half of Begonia's pain. His physical strength was still not enough for the big falls and fights every day, especially when it came to the end of the fight. All the martial arts actors routinely had to perform a set of "Tiger Boat Rowing." Twenty or thirty people were rolling and tumbling on the stage like turning a top. The movements were very fast, and if they were a little late, they would easily bump into or be pressed down by others; and as long as one person made a mistake, the others would be affected immediately, and there would be a thunderous cheer from the audience. (266)</p>
<p>The author talked with Mr. Wei in the rehearsal room about his ideas when writing Wu Sangui. He said, "I write Wu Sangui to restore him to his original appearance as a hero, but this hero is a 'individualistic' hero, so he will only plan for himself, wanting to transform from a high-ranking official to a feudal ruler who plots to usurp the throne. At the same time, this is the reason for his inevitable failure."</p>
<p>At this time, I could only retreat, hoping to recognize Wu Sangui and his decline when "Yang E Biography" is performed.</p>

<h3>Author Liu Henwo Passed Away</h3>
<p>Mr. Liu Guangzu of Baiyue (pen name Henwo) was good at literature. Before the war, he lived in Shanghai and wrote a lot for various newspapers. The literary giants of Shanghai all traveled with him. Mr. Liu was known for his unrestrainedness, talent, and excellent character, and was respected by scholars. Since the Incident, Mr. Liu was unwilling to remain in seclusion and devoted himself to the country, making a trip to the southwest. For the past five years, he traveled to various provinces, serving in the military, but not forgetting literature. Mainland publications were honored to have a word from him. However, Heaven did not grant him a long life, and he died in a hostel in Dushan, Guizhou on the 29th of October. When the bad news came, all his friends mourned him! It is now heard that Mr. Liu's family in Shanghai plans to hold a memorial service at the Jingtu Temple on Guling Road on the 21st of this month. Since Mr. Liu was sociable and had many friends, it is certain that there will be a grand and mournful event.</p>

<p>The Entertainment World</p>
<h3>It is Not Easy to Please the "Extra"</h3>
<p>— Hua Yu</p>
<p>On the stage, holding flags and following the literary and military officials in the play, these are the "extras." Although they do not sing or fight, they seem very easy to do in the eyes of the audience, but in reality, they are not easy. The brilliance of a play may be reduced by the "extra" taking the wrong step, giving the audience a bad impression.</p>
<p>Speaking of the treatment of "extras," it is lower than any other role. Although the job of "extra" is not very important, it is much harder than any other role. When other characters do not need to sing, they can hide backstage to rest, refresh themselves, and rest their voices. Only the "extras" cannot. They still appear on the stage before the play and enter the backstage after the play. Although they stand for a very long time, they still follow the literary and military officials on stage scene after scene, even "changing clothes but not people," holding flags and standing there. No matter how sore their feet are or how tired they are, they cannot be lazy for once. And the treatment they get is so meager. Although the main characters can sing and fight, they will never appear on stage as many times as the "extras," and they will never be as busy as the "extras," but the price they get is always several times, or even more than several times, that of the "extras."</p>
<p>That's how things are in the world. Those who have authority and higher positions can be idle and do nothing, and they get a lot of money. People with smaller positions, their work is so important, their hands and feet don't stop, and they get very little reward. "More work and less pay" is the most disappointing thing. So we often see these "extras" standing on the stage, always listless. This may be because they appear on stage too many times and their bodies are exhausted. Under such circumstances, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not take the wrong step.</p>
<p>If the treatment of "extras" can be increased a little, although it cannot be as much as the supporting roles, it may be able to balance it with other work. However, it seems that no matter what play, there is always a need for "extras." If there are no "extras," I am afraid it will not be a play.</p>
<h3>Wu Sangui's Character</h3>
<p>— Sha Yuan</p>
<p>One of the Characters in "The Biography of Yang E"</p>
<p>"The Biography of Yang E" is Mr. Wei Ruhui's latest work. It is the third play in the Ming Dynasty Regret series, following "Ge Nenniang" and "The Sea Hero Zheng Chenggong."</p>
<p>In the play, in addition to Mr. Wei's consistent strengths - familiarity with historical figures, concise lines, and detailed textual research - we also see that the sculpting of the characters' personalities is deeper and more powerful.</p>
<p>In particular, the author puts some effort into writing Wu Sangui's (played by Shu Shi) personality. We only need to see Wu Sangui constantly scratching his nose (this habit is completely based on textual research), his insidious, cunning, and unpredictable actions. Whether from his actions or his tone, we can see it clearly and be attracted to it.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 19 Dusk, the Tartar Cavalry Raised Dust and Raided the City</p>
<p>Wu Sangui led the major and minor partial commanders and adjutants to welcome them, and also offered cattle, wine, and rewards to the Qing army. Dorgon then ordered Sangui's army to tie white cloth on their shoulders as a sign and act as the vanguard of the Qing army, leading the Qing army to drive straight in. They encountered the roving bandits in the place of Yipianshi. At that time, most of Li Chuang's subordinates had experienced battles and were very valiant. At first, they did not know that the Qing army had entered the pass. They still thought that Wu Sangui's army was coming to fight because Sangui's request for help from the Qing was very secret and had not been publicized in the pass. Li Chuang relied on his large number of soldiers and horses, so how could he put Wu Sangui in his heart? When the two armies were close, they formed formations. Li Zicheng arranged a long snake formation that stretched from the North Mountain to the sea, with flags densely arranged, and the momentum was very majestic. The Qing army was arranged in rows and columns, all ambushing behind Wu Sangui's army. Those of Sangui's subordinates who were at the front were the armies of Ma Bao and Bai Xianzong. Zhang Cangqiu and others were all in the army. The two sides beat the war drums and shook their momentum. Ma Bao stood on his horse under the large flag, with Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei by his side. Ma Bao patted Zhang Cangqiu's shoulder and said, "Today, we are fighting the roving bandits head-on for the first time. If we can win this battle, the roving bandits will inevitably decline after their defeat and will never recover. Moreover, the Qing army is lurking behind us, so we must show some skills in front of them and fight for some face. This relationship is no small matter. Commander Zhang is usually loyal and enthusiastic and always wants to punish thieves for the country. Today, you can kill a few more bandit leaders." Zhang Cangqiu was even more excited after hearing Ma Bao's words. Then he said to Chen Fei, "Let's go to the battle and fight for a while, don't let the Qing army laugh at us for being unattended." (322)</p>
<p>The author talked with Mr. Wei in the rehearsal room about his idea when writing Wu Sangui. He said, "I write Wu Sangui to restore him to his original appearance as a hero, but this hero is a 'individualistic' hero, so he will only plan for himself, wanting to transform from a high-ranking official to a feudal ruler who plots to usurp the throne. At the same time, this is the reason for his inevitable failure."</p>
