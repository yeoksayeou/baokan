<h3 id="c10">擱淺中的荷印談判 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>荷屬東印度當局拒絕了日本五月七日所提出的「最後建議」之後，雙方談判已無形擱淺；三數日間日政府迭開會議，旋於隔昨決定命令芳澤一行退出在巴達維亞進行的談判，表示對荷印覆文不能接受，同時荷印日僑亦紛紛撒退，在表面上已呈非常緊張之勢。近一年來，荷印問題無論在遠東以至對於全世界都是重要的一環，此次談判的擱淺，是吾會發生嚴重後果，甚至牽動世界大局，正是個極堪注意的問題。</p>
<p>直到此際，關於日本向荷印所要求的內容，以至雙方主要爭執之點，外間悉無所知，至多僅亦從荷方代表本月七日的兩點聲明中曉得荷方最重要的意見是：一，不承認「東亞新秩序」及其領導；二，反對以荷印物資直接間接資敵（指德國）。這兩點自然都是雙方見解歧異之點，但是在此以外，假定日方竟肯保證不使原料流入軸心國家，而欲取得荷印輸出物資的全部或最大部分，大槪亦非荷方所能接受。由此可見其間難題正多，不只在政治方面難於接近，即在純經濟領域之內亦復存在着若干暗礁，這也就是縱然日方代表一再更迭，荏苒經年，而談判始終不能獲得妥協的原因。</p>
<p>自從日方注意力從亞洲大陸轉而南向以來。荷印的資源是被當做生命綫般看待着的。有田兩度關於荷印的聲明之後，繼之以商業談判的進行，縱然其間關於油類輸日等項雙方已獲妥協，但顯外距離日力要求還遠。此次荷印當局的態度；竟有意外的堅强，日方外交已往曾使英國有所牽就，蘇聯假以辭色，維希爲之屈膝，而對於此一祖國已告淪陷的荷印，則縱在芳澤的「最後建議」提出之後，仍復無所進展。五月三十日日外相松岡發表聲明日本絕對忠於三國同盟，同時又暗示着如果國際局勢之發展使日本對南洋的和平政策成爲不可能，則必視時　的變化而再行考慮該項政策，措辭雖尙委婉，却是變相的對英美荷印加以壓力，以期打開談判僵局，日方報章輿論，近頃允見喧囂，與松岡對荷印問題的表示相呼應。現在日方在撒退代表之外，關於進一步的對策尙在嚴重考慮之中，而德政府發言人則已從事挑撥，慫恿日方强硬對付，可見如果這一星星之火而竟成燎原，正是亟謀在遠東牽制英美的軸心國家所樂見的。</p>
<p>不過日本雖是同盟的一員，且擴展慾求極强，但其動向實決於其自身的利害，並非其盟友所盡能左右。有如日前日人武籐貞一在報知新聞撰文，即認爲日本在前次大戰中之依附協的國爲失策，堅主不應重蹈那一覆轍。他並深以那次日軍之輕妄攻略靑島爲憾，但目前環繞着荷印的局勢，又絕非靑島所能此擬於萬一，假使冒昧從事行動，也許會引起更艱困的結局吧！第一，現在的荷印，已絕不像一年以前那樣暴露和無力，日方已於英法西綫潰敗時失掉了運用閃電戰的良機。該地陸上防禦力量姑置不論，即以海上實力而言，其包括若干驅逐艦潛水艇的輕型艦隊，用以對付一個逾海遠征的艦隊，據說是頗可以發揮威力的，何况更有相當實力的空軍相互配合。第二，就南中國海戰略形勢而言，從日方任何一個海軍根據地到荷印任何一個島嶼都在千餘海浬以上。超過了海遠出作戰的最大距離，以續航力較欠充實的日艦，在作戰技術上當感到絕大困難，而且要穿過新加坡所控制着的海面以進窺爪哇和蘇門答臘也正非易事。第三，更重要的：英美與荷印在遠東的軍事合作業已形成，新加坡泗水馬尼拉與澳北的達爾文港彼此互爲犄角，其軍力的總合，在以逸待勞的形勢下，是足可以應付日方的攻勢的。據日人伊藤正德的看法，認爲如果日本攻擊荷印，必將引起美日戰爭，證以美方一貫對荷印的關切和最近荷外長克里芬氏之僕僕於巴達維亞與華盛頓之間，可信此說當與事實不甚相遠。則當日方對荷從事斷然行動之前，必須對美已具不惜一戰的決意，雖然邇來對美强硬論調時有所聞，但日方有識之士則已漸漸看淸了一味盲動的危險。日政府對於荷印問題態度頗見持重，即在談判已見擱淺的此際，仍舊沒有立即採取行動的模樣，這一方自然是看到了前途的種種困難，另一方面也正是種種持重見解的反映。</p>
<p>是以日方縱已決定將在荷印的代表予以召回，其所期望者却仍爲能以荷印之讓步而告妥協。目前形勢，已使南不在日荷談判的本身，而要決定於國際的整個形勢和戰局</p>

<p>昨日金市蛤赤暗盤、先漲後跌、雖本屆掉期將於明晨八時舉行、但照匯豐小　檀美匯掛牌與黑市同、均爲五元三七五結價、爲六千四百七十九元、今日若仍站原價言、僅撳十元、　方貼出予買方亦僅十數元、多方難施慣技、且在前後市兩利空消息下、荷印局勢復緊張、日方代表宣稱將實施三國同盟條約、及日橋撤退等傳說、故證券幫德孚及銀號恒記進、抬至六千四百八十九元、且照結價做抬、故不久匯票商巨額套賣、在利空消息下、價遂步落、下午現金　時和更傾　千餘兩、降見六千四百六十一元、終僅軋小三元之微、全日交易一萬四五千兩、各方人心稍帶不定、現金上午由誠達出祥和五十兩、價照期交高二百五十五元、下午福慶永出時和一十兩、高二百五元、軋小十數元、飾金　金等仍平、</p>

<p>公債暗盤、暗市繼續上漲、丙種已穿出七十元大關、其他各種均衝出一檔、金融界進胃更濃、如國華及女子等銀行、繼金城而大爲吸收、銀根鬆濫、益可證明此爲游資歸宿惟一之出路、因屆半年利息期限漸近、現在收買已連同四個半月利息在內、昨日大中代某銀行買進、極爲踴躍、協大聯益恒康福星信昌益昌以及聯和先後均有買進、協大賣出戊種、餘爲零星散戶供給、行市則逐步上騰、丙種竟穿出七十元大關、協大繼續收買、潤德益昌同順謙益利豐易中樂茂等圴爲買戶、交易益形展開、賣出方面、信昌胡鶴記永康較多、聯和及仁豐爲先出後進、餘均爲一般散戶放空所供給、結果一律再漲三角至九角不等、成交總數共計約三百五十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交三友實　社股五十股、價爲二十三元正、</p>

<p>紗市續升、且趨勢仍堅、同時香港幫對於雙馬紗需要繼續不懈、所以人心良好、市上籌碼殊感缺乏、空頭掉期仍貼出二角半、多方非不出拆息、反有收入利鈿、因之做多心思較濃矣、然有一部份議論、買者多而深恐不能利多、故小公司方面仍在空方掙扎、市盤漲高後又復回下、一般說者、市面或者還有見一千四百五十元之可能性、本日之走勢、已顯著徘徊之象、總之根本問題、須恃實銷爲第一也、二十支雙馬高價爲一千四百七十五元、低價爲一千四百五十八元、午後初做氣勢甚昂、爲一千四百七十一元、漲至七十四元、　後證券幫出、逐步跌至一千四百六十元、最後價一千四百六十五元、今日有棉紗六百三十五件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開氣勢雖緊、然散戶盈利吐出、首盤價一千四百六十五元、賣者多而買者少、回鬆至一千四百五十八元、旋聞廣幫生　與盛目雙馬交易愈旺買風尤熾、市盤步步上升、漲至一千四百七十五元、中途獲利者了結、又鬆至一千四百六十四元、收盤回上至一千四百七十二元、查半日間成交統計九千八百包、內香港幫進一千三百包、同行八千五百包、</p>
<p>金雙馬標準紗市况、較爲平平、中途因現紗銷路良好、亦見上升、惟午後稍形回挫也、結果七月期跌五角、八月期跌二元、查全日成交量爲九千一百五十包、茲將其一日間高低及收盤價列左、</p>

<p>另訊滬埠洋行外棉交易、人心興奮、市况熱烈、因海外採購頗費周折、同時　棉一再高漲、并且連日紗市情形展開有利、預卜棉市前途、當屬繁榮無疑、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、因氣候報告利於多頭、及棉布貿易情形良好、同業買進甚力、因之市况一再活潑堅昂、結果收盤價格、較之上日高漲十七至二十五鎊音不等</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因散戶賣出、及買方不斷掉期而跌、但續後又因投機者抵補白洛去新花而回漲、昨日收盤價格、除白洛去七八月份跌半羅比外、其餘仍漲一至四羅比不等、又預測今日開　市况看高二羅比　五、</p>

<p>東市平淡無榮辱、雖雙馬紗價頻漲、仍不能引起囤戶興趣、同業且逢高拋　、殊無進胃、故白貨龍頭細布棧單收盤價四十四元七角七分半、僅漲二分半、四君子嗶嘰週旋在一元四角五分左右、晚收價爲一元四角五分一二五、</p>

<p>糖業公會此次期糖發生糾紛、公議結價了結、但決議案迄未對外公佈、遂有不無乘機朦蔽其顧客、凡客戶之空戶獲利者、則以公會結價辦法爲詞、减少其應得之贏利、客戶之多頭賠本者、則略去遞减辦法、槪以九十三元結價、或則以軋平交易不結價、仍須付出全部損失爲言、因之客戶中頗有表示不滿希望該公會將該議決案公開發表、以免朦混取巧、</p>
<p>昨糖市初疲後緊、結果無甚上落、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白、外棧新貨初僅八十九元、旋轉緊爲八十九元半·九十元·九十一元、三四月老貨開盤最弱、祇八十六元、後升八十七·八十八元·八十九元半、荷赤仍軟爲六十八元、小二元、太古車白無軒輊、B嘜一百零八元、DY嘜九十五元、HX嘜八十八元至八十九元、本廠一號冰一百二十四元、晶明冰一百二十五元、國糖據客函訊、因內銷得價較昂、故雖　申、聞刁青運銷汕頭竟達八十八元、白糖一百四五十元、因此比價相差甚遠云、</p>

<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>這種方式、側重在敎員的「能」與「力」上、非有特殊訓練與修養的敎師、不能擔任、也不易收效、</p>
<p>至於課本指導方式、一般的心理、都把敎師當作魔術師、想完全依賴他來「點石成金」、這大概是一個錯誤的心理、因爲敎師所負的責任乃是指導、點撥、並不是製造、要想把英文學好、十分之九的工程、還要靠自已努力自修、所謂自修、並不是十年面壁的苦役姿態、乃是一種活潑有趣的自動工作、</p>
<p>以上三個條件、都有互相呼應的關係、沒有吃過苦的、也許一時體騐不出來、在研究的征途上打過旋子、走過回頭路的、大槪一看就明瞭了、下面要檢討一下讀·寫·說·譯·的幾個小鬥徑、</p>
<p>讀</p>
<p>（一）讀什麼　學校的課本、居多數早由敎務主任和敎員規定、不得更變、有的學校也很願尊軍學生的意見、有的敎員討好學生、由學生任意選擇課本、這麼一來、較之於規定課本尤其危險、靑年心理、有的是盲從、有的是喜新厭舊、有的好高騖遠這都是病態心理、</p>
<p>記得從前某班學生、主張讀英文報紙、報紙的英文極不規則、修詞學上列爲禁忌、用新字、用怪字、用僻字、甚而用自造字、而且報紙自有報紙的文件、十之九都有點油腔滑調、我們怎麼可以去學呢、譬如學書法拿草字當帖臨、豈非笑話奇談、當然、報紙上偶然也有工整的文章、但很少、如說要學點時事字彙、先問我們是否用得着、</p>
<p>就是雜誌的文章、根本也不宜當課本研讀、到了相當的程度、也許可以應用Reader　Digest之類的刊物作補充讀物、可是到了這個程度、我們的英文知識也許要逼着我們去探求更佳更美更豐富的寶藏去了、</p>
<p>究竟應當讀什麼呢、簡單的答覆、卽（一）純粹的英文、（二）標準作者所編的標準課本及其他讀物、（三）洽合自己程度的選擇、</p>
<p>（二）怎樣讀　我們讀的步驟往往是錯誤的、十人之中有九個半先查生字、生字查完、巳是精疲力盡、道個辦法旣不科學又不合邏輯、設若我們的課本選擇得洽當、筆者認爲應儘先將全篇或全章、從頭至尾、看一遍二遍或三遍、雖說有點囫圇吞的味兒、倒是毫無關係、因爲目的是要抓住全篇的大意、抓住大意之後、第二步就要把全篇的段落找出來、（此處段落並非節段Paragraph）每個段落用一個字或一個短句、標出小題、然後第三步就要看這一段中有幾節、短文的段與節多半是混合的、如其是大段、也許有二三節、逐節我們得仔細把牠的主句找出、這倒不難、因爲英文作法、每節的主句（即主體思想）不是第一句、就在末一句內、根少含混在中間的我出了主句、知道道一節大概是說的什麼、這才逐句的細談、</p>

<h3 id="c104">「吃飯店飯的」呼籲　陽春跳一角六大關 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— 滌生</p>
<p>炒肉可比斷綫風箏</p>
<p>記得二年前的春大，在下剛流亡到孤島的上海，開始「吃飯店飯」時，那時「陽春飯」一碗不過七個銅子，還裝得滿滿的；米粒潔白粗大，是道地的杜米飯。只消二碗，肚子就緊鼓鼓的飽了。</p>
<p>炒肉也是七個銅子一塊，肥瘦適中，足有豆腐乾方塊那麼大，所以二塊炒肉同二碗「陽春飯」，足供一餐大嚼，左右不過是一毛錢的事情，旣體面又實惠，還有堂倌的殷動招呼，當作你上賓看待。</p>
<p>可是好景不長，情形有江河日下之勢，「陽春飯」從七個銅子一躍而爲每碗七分，之後，扶搖直上「跳出一角大關」，直到現在造成一角六的最高峰。同時還偷工减料，由平底碗改成尖底碗，由杜米換二號洋秈，香港米還攙雜碎米，淺淺的粗糙得很，吃了三五碗，纔勉强覺得不餓罷了；不打謊，絕對並不是眞的飽。</p>
<p>炒肉一味的小，小，小，小到薄薄的一片，叫人發生有分不出是「塊」是「絲」之感。偶或大降暴風，我相信這薄薄的一片肉，也許會像斷了經的風箏一樣，直飛向九霄雲外的。加一小賬，是照例不折不扣的，現在一餐飯不是一元，也得九毛，這加一小賬，就儘够以前一餐飯錢了。我對堂倌的位置，倒有點不勝其艷羨，而自嘆不如。</p>
<p>這幾天報載「米價慘落」「蔬菜狂跌」，可是我們的飯店老闆，感覺似乎大大不如以前加價時候的那樣敏捷了。「陽春飯」還是一角六，並且還是尖底碗，盛的還是淺淺的；炒肉自然更沒有回復舊觀的希望，就是盆頭蔬菜，也還是老價鈿二角，硬硼硼！始終維持着他的「眞不二價」。</p>
<p>在下以一名「吃飯店飯」的資格，在這裹熱誠向飯店老班們呼籲，該漲則漲，該跌應跌，要求他們少打一點賺錢的算盤，减輕些小吃客的負担，爲善最樂，那就功德無量了。</p>

<p>從前碰見了熟人，開口第一句總是脫不了「今天天氣哈哈哈一的，於是乎；你也笑，我也笑，他也笑，弄得大家都笑。好像不開口則巳，一開口則非此莫可，否則的話，就無從開頭」。</p>
<p>現在可不同了，不見人倒也罷，一見人總是不知不覺地談到生活問題上面去，由生活問題而轉到米限價的屢决冲破，煤價的不息上漲，於是乎，你也嘆息，我也嘆息，他也嘆息，弄得大家都嘆息。</p>
<p>近來，工部局定的港米也來了，運煤的水脚費也跌了，於是米價煤價連日大跌，雖然米價仍舊站在一百「開外」的大關，煤價仍舊賣到十五六塊一擔，可是仍舊脫不了「本行」——生活問題的難解決，大家都以爲什麼米價跌落，而生活指數反見上漲，互相討論着，最後弄得你也憤怒，我也憤怒，他也憤怒，大家都憤怒。</p>

<p>編輯先生……我們也是被壓迫的工徒，我們的工資是每日四元起到十幾兀，工作每天十二小時，看書與看報也受着極大的限度。過去，我們爲了生活，爲了獲得最低限度維持生命的食糧，始終默默地忍受着。</p>
<p>但是，老闆們最近却强逼着要我們簽訂一張所謂「志願書」的契的，它的內容就是這樣：</p>
<p>一，年在十六歲以上，二十歲以下；身體强壯，品行端正，具有初中程度，經考試合格，再試用三個月後，始得爲正式練習生。</p>
<p>一，練習生入廠學習期限規定三年，畢業後須在廠服務二年。如遇走失，或天災人禍等情，本廠概不負責任。</p>
<p>一，在上述規定之年限內，練習生不得報學改業，否則應賠償廠方學習費國幣一千元正，由保證人負其責任。</p>
<p>一，練習生畢業時，由總經理親自考試及格者，給予證書，升任職員，不及格者延長期限，或竟辭退。</p>
<p>一練習生不得私藏銀錢，廠中應給之款，一律收人貯蓄摺，如需用物件，可申請庶務員代辦。（中略）</p>
<p>這裏，我們沒有業餘自修的自由，我們沒有使用我們自己工資的自由；而最重要的，是我們要無條件地簽訂一張五年的賣身絕契。……</p>
<p>先生！請您想想，在這樣的條件下，我們的生活該是怎樣的生活？</p>
<p>但是，也一樣，我們爲了生活，爲了獲得最低限度的食糧，曾準備接受過：可是當我們去問我們的保證人要求担保的時候，他們的答覆都是說：「可以是可以的，祇要你把一千元錢交給我，我就爲你担保」。先生！做工徒的人又那裏米一千元錢，我們是碰壁了。在四處碰壁的時候，廠方却非特一點也不諒解，並且限期在本月底以前必須交進，否則就是開除，這眞使我們「上天無路，入地無門』。</p>
<p>先生，我們要生活，我們願意工作，爲了獲得最低限度的生活資料，我們甚至準備把我們的幸福整個地犧牲，但是，現在是一切完全了，老闆鐵的手腕，把我們六十個人的生命扼得緊緊地，我們沒有一千元錢，眼看着失業與流離失所就在眼前，放在我們面前的是死的道路。</p>
<p>但我們要生的，我們要生的。……以最大的希望，寫信給先生，請先生予我們刋出，代我們向社會呼籲，請正義的人士們予我們以援手。……</p>

<p>（九）一個古澤的莊稼人</p>
<p>霎眼又是隆冬天氣了，這一晚，小梅寶照例又把湘綺所留下的一本貼照簿捧出來，翻看了一遍，一面伏在暖坑上，媽媽長媽媽短的和秋海棠兜搭着。</p>
<p>「方才不是給你說過了，媽媽比大嫁子長得還高一些！。」今兒秋海棠的心裏委實很煩惱，小梅寶把同一個問題向他重複着提出了三四遍以後，他答話時的語氣，不覺便比平日生硬了許多。</p>
<p>前三天他就聽到過這麼一個消息：</p>
<p>「京裏的情形已經大變了，革命軍在上個月底就從南方打了過來，五色旗也取消了，再掛出去就要槍斃；男革命黨女革命黨到處都是：向來做官的人都給矗走了；銀行也倒了好幾家；有錢的人都得吃官司，每個莊稼人最多不能有十畝田，再多一分就得拖去站木籠……」</p>
<p>這是一個慣於在鄕下販賣大綢的山東人說的，憑秋海棠的識見來判斷，其中當然有一大半是不值一笑的謠言；可是大局的已經發生變化，却也決非一個經紀人所能杜造的。</p>
<p>「銀行也倒了幾家……，」</p>
<p>這句話是最使秋海棠感到不安的。</p>
<p>而今天他所接到的趙四的快信，果然就證實了那山東人的話。他說東省殖邊銀行跟着×軍的撤退而倒閉了，福華銀行也因×××和×××下台而透着很不穩的消息，道兩家却正是秋海棠儲藏他僅有的一些積蓄的所在啊！所以照趙四的意思，他自己應該立刻就去一次，以免全軍覆沒。（一三一）</p>

<p>毛遂自薦</p>
<p>過去，製片家要請一位明星去擔任某種角色，常常感到很大的困難；可是現在這一切困難克復了。許多明星都實行毛遂自薦的方式。譬如瓊克勞馥，當她讀到「女人」的劇本，就要求扮演蕩婦克立絲，又有「花月重溫」裏的蘇姍一角，也是因她請求而獲得，結果，都獲得非常的成功。還有海蒂拉瑪之和詹姆史都華合演「飛來艷福」“Come　Live　with　me”也是由於海蒂的自薦而成功的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Breakdown of Negotiations Between Japan and the Dutch East Indies; Arita to Return to Japan Soon; Cabinet Holds Secret Meeting to Decide Final Stance; Instructions to Delegation to Be Published Within Days <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo - Chief Japanese negotiator Arita, in the Japanese-Dutch negotiations, recently told the Yomiuri Shimbun via radiophone that due to the Dutch East Indies' strong stance, a compromise is impossible. Therefore, he may leave the Dutch East Indies without consulting with Dutch officials. The newspaper also quoted Arita as saying that unless Foreign Minister Matsuoka issues instructions, he personally sees no need to negotiate with the Dutch side before leaving. He reiterated that the Dutch East Indies' firm stance leaves no room for compromise. The paper also stated that Arita had revealed that public opinion in the Dutch East Indies is extremely strong. Various newspapers also supported the position of the Dutch economic representatives. Arita is expected to depart for Japan on June 29. This afternoon, the Japanese Foreign Ministry telegraphed Arita with instructions to return to Japan, specifying that Japan's policy regarding the Dutch East Indies' response to Japan's final proposals, the instructions for the Japanese-Dutch negotiations, and Japan's statement of its stance will be announced here tomorrow. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - With Japan abandoning economic negotiations in Batavia, government authorities held a secret cabinet meeting yesterday to resolve Japan's future policy. It was subsequently declared that if the Dutch East Indies' "rigid attitude" requires military action to subdue it, "now is the time." Government sources stated that Japan can no longer tolerate the Dutch East Indies' "belligerence." It is widely believed that the Dutch representatives' refusal to negotiate and sell the goods Japan requested is a blatant defiance of the Axis powers by the Dutch East Indies government and an obstacle to ending the China Incident. It is reported that the chief Japanese representative, Arita, may be ordered to return to Japan. Japanese officials insist that Japan is determined to satisfy its interests in the near future. They believe that since the opening of the Burma Road and the U.S. pledge to lend money to Chongqing, this failed negotiation is Japan's first setback. Japanese officials assert that because Japan and the Soviet Union have signed a treaty of friendship, the Soviet border no longer poses a threat to Japan. The British navy is "overwhelmed," and the United States is preoccupied with concerns in the Atlantic and unable to assist the British navy in Asia. Therefore, Japan does not need to be cautious in dealing with the Dutch East Indies. (International News Service, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Domei News Agency announced today that the Foreign Ministry has issued government instructions to Arita, chief representative for the Japanese-Dutch negotiations. It is understood that this directive will be publicly announced tomorrow. Domei also stated that the Foreign Ministry will simultaneously release a statement clarifying the Japanese government's views on the Japanese-Dutch negotiations and the Dutch East Indies' response to Japan's proposals. This morning, Foreign Minister Matsuoka reported to the Emperor on the Japanese-Dutch negotiations and other diplomatic issues, which lasted ninety-five minutes. (United Press, 12th) Tokyo - Official sources here declared last night that the Japanese cabinet met yesterday for four hours and has now decided on Japan's final stance toward Batavia and new instructions for the Japanese delegation to the Dutch East Indies. The content of the resolutions will be published within a reasonable period. Well-informed sources here believe that the Japanese delegation will be recalled from the Dutch East Indies. It is believed that the cabinet has also considered the consequences of this action. (Haitong Telegram, 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Washington Has Not Yet Expressed an Attitude on the Matter <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Washington - News that Tokyo has instructed its representatives in Batavia to terminate negotiations with the Dutch East Indies has attracted considerable attention here. However, Under Secretary of State Welles, while hosting reporters on behalf of Hull this morning, declined to comment on the news before receiving official information. When asked whether the U.S. would have access to raw materials such as elephant hide if the Dutch East Indies acceded to Japanese demands, Welles replied that he did not know what Japan was demanding or what the Dutch East Indies was refusing, so he could not comment at this time. Japanese sources claim that Japan's negotiations with the Dutch East Indies are purely economic in nature, but meetings among those in the Tokyo power structure regarding the Dutch East Indies negotiations seem to clearly indicate that the negotiations are of a political, even military, nature. Although there are reports from Tokyo that Japan cannot accept the Dutch East Indies' response, Washington officials still do not believe that Japan will launch an aggressive act to seize what it wants from the Dutch East Indies for itself and its Axis allies. Washington is closely monitoring the situation. It is widely expected that the Dutch East Indies will not change its firm stance. Whether Japan is merely bluffing or intends to advance southward while still mired in China will soon be seen. According to recent news from here, those in Tokyo who advocate moderation are gaining influence. There is no immediate concern of major changes occurring in the East. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

<p>Tokyo - The Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated in today's editorial that the withdrawal of the Japanese economic delegation from Batavia will strengthen Japan's determination to make the entire Dutch East Indies an "important member" of Japan's "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." The nationalist Hochi Shimbun demanded the immediate withdrawal of the delegation, arguing that delaying the withdrawal would damage Japan's prestige, and urged the government to take "the most effective measures" to cope with the situation. The newspaper stated that the resources of the Dutch East Indies should not be monopolized by the Netherlands, Britain, or the United States. The Dutch East Indies should remember that Japan will not hesitate to make any sacrifices to achieve "co-prosperity," regardless of the attitude of the Dutch East Indies and third countries.

<p>Tokyo - The Asahi Shimbun's report from Batavia today states that a large number of Japanese residents are evacuating from the Dutch East Indies due to fears about the future relationship between Japan and the Dutch East Indies. The report states that the mass evacuation of Japanese residents, including those from Borneo and Sumatra, is under consideration due to the tense relationship caused by the breakdown of trade negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies.

<p>Berlin - A German government spokesman stated yesterday that if Japanese Prime Minister Konoe takes decisive action on the Dutch East Indies issue, the German government will support Japan's policy and recognize Tokyo's legitimate desire to seek "living space" in the Dutch East Indies and establish a new order. The spokesman criticized the Dutch East Indies for not exporting raw materials to Germany, and a German official stated that the Dutch East Indies "in reality is an ally of the enemy." Observers believe that the spokesman's statement is a warning to Britain, the United States, and the Dutch East Indies, and that Berlin has given Tokyo a blank check, meaning that now that the economic conference in Batavia has ended, Japan can act freely as it sees fit.

<p>Washington - The Philippines is considering a second amendment to its Independence Act of 1934. This amendment is intended to suspend export taxes in order to adjust the country's economy as it moves toward independence. Philippine Resident Commissioner Elizalde, after consulting with U.S. congressional and executive leaders for several weeks, stated that his proposal does not change the independence process in 1946, but only recognizes the economic pressure the Philippines is under due to the war. Elizalde emphasized that the suspension of export taxes is limited to one year, after which the tax will be reimposed. (United Press, 12th)</p>

<p>New York - Henry Luce, an American author born in China and editor-in-chief of Time and Life magazines, stated on American radio last night that the Chinese army has increased to four million men and that the Japanese invasion is making no progress. Luce, a director of the United China Relief, recently returned from a general inspection of Free China. Luce and his wife, the famous playwright Clare Boothe Luce, personally visited the front lines in China for twenty days. He stated that the current positions of the Chinese army are along a 2,000-mile front. If Japan wants to succeed, it must make a maximum effort to break through the salient points of the Chinese military line. If the Chinese army remains in place, any policy Japan adopts will inevitably lead to a miserable defeat. Many educated Chinese people do not understand why the United States is still supplying military supplies to Japan. Japanese planes are currently using American gasoline and bombs made from American metals to bomb Chongqing. However, China's ability to mount a "great resistance" is largely due to the Chinese people knowing that the United States is friendly to China and to the expressions of support from the United China Relief.

<h3 id="e10">Stalled Negotiations with the Dutch East Indies <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>After the Dutch East Indies authorities rejected Japan's "final proposal" of May 7, negotiations between the two sides have effectively stalled. Over the past few days, the Japanese government has held repeated meetings and decided yesterday to order Arita and his delegation to withdraw from the negotiations in Batavia, indicating that it cannot accept the Dutch East Indies' response. At the same time, Japanese residents in the Dutch East Indies are also withdrawing en masse, presenting a very tense situation on the surface. For nearly a year, the Dutch East Indies issue has been an important link in the Far East and even for the entire world. The stalling of these negotiations is bound to have serious consequences and even affect the global situation, making it an issue worthy of the utmost attention.</p>
<p>To this day, the outside world knows nothing about the content of Japan's demands on the Dutch East Indies or the major points of contention between the two sides. At most, it only knows from the Dutch representative's two-point statement on May 7 that the Dutch side's most important opinions are: first, not to recognize the "East Asia New Order" and its leadership; and second, to oppose the direct or indirect use of Dutch East Indies resources to aid the enemy (referring to Germany). These two points are naturally points of disagreement between the two sides, but beyond this, even if the Japanese side were willing to guarantee that raw materials would not flow into Axis countries and sought to obtain all or most of the Dutch East Indies' exports, it is likely that the Dutch side would not accept it. This shows that there are many difficulties involved, not only in the political realm but also within the purely economic sphere, which is why negotiations have failed to achieve a compromise despite repeated changes in the Japanese representative over the years.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese side's attention shifted from the Asian mainland southward, the Dutch East Indies' resources have been treated as a lifeline. After Arita's two statements regarding the Dutch East Indies, commercial negotiations were launched. Although the two sides reached a compromise on items such as oil exports to Japan, it was still far from meeting Japan's demands. The Dutch East Indies authorities' unexpectedly strong attitude has made Japan's diplomacy, which had previously accommodated Britain, appeased the Soviet Union, and forced Vichy to yield, unable to make progress even after Arita's "final proposal" was presented to the Dutch East Indies, whose homeland had already fallen. On May 30, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka issued a statement declaring that Japan was absolutely loyal to the Tripartite Pact, while hinting that if the development of the international situation made Japan's peaceful policy toward the South Seas impossible, it would reconsider that policy depending on the circumstances. Although the wording was still euphemistic, it was, in effect, putting pressure on Britain, the United States, and the Dutch East Indies in order to break the deadlock in negotiations. The Japanese newspapers and public opinion have recently been clamoring in response to Matsuoka's statements on the Dutch East Indies issue. Now that the Japanese side has withdrawn its representatives, it is still seriously considering further countermeasures, while a German government spokesman has engaged in incitement, urging the Japanese side to deal with the situation harshly. It is evident that the Axis countries, which are eager to contain Britain and the United States in the Far East, would be pleased if this spark were to start a prairie fire.</p>
<p>However, although Japan is a member of the alliance and has a strong desire for expansion, its actions are actually determined by its own interests and are not entirely controllable by its allies. For example, in a recent article in the Hochi Shimbun, Japanese scholar Teiichi Muto argued that Japan's affiliation with the Allied powers in the previous World War was a mistake and insisted that it should not repeat that error. He also deeply regretted the Japanese army's reckless capture of Qingdao at that time. However, the current situation surrounding the Dutch East Indies is by no means comparable to Qingdao. If Japan takes reckless action, it may lead to an even more difficult outcome. First, the current Dutch East Indies is no longer as exposed and weak as it was a year ago. The Japanese side has missed the opportunity to use blitzkrieg tactics when the Western front of Britain and France collapsed. Leaving aside the land defense forces there, in terms of naval strength alone, its light fleet, including a number of destroyers and submarines, is said to be quite capable of dealing with an overseas expeditionary fleet. What is more, there is a considerable air force to coordinate with it. Second, in terms of the strategic situation in the South China Sea, any Japanese naval base is more than a thousand nautical miles from any island in the Dutch East Indies, exceeding the maximum distance for overseas operations. Japanese ships, which lack sufficient endurance, would face great difficulties in terms of combat technology. Moreover, it is not easy to penetrate the waters controlled by Singapore to seize Java and Sumatra. Third, and more importantly, military cooperation between Britain, the United States, and the Dutch East Indies in the Far East has already taken shape. Singapore, Surabaya, Manila, and Darwin in northern Australia are mutually reinforcing, and their combined military strength, in a situation of waiting for the enemy, is sufficient to cope with the Japanese offensive. According to Japanese scholar Masanori Ito, an attack on the Dutch East Indies by Japan will inevitably lead to a war between the United States and Japan. Given the U.S.'s consistent concern for the Dutch East Indies and the recent frequent visits by Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens between Batavia and Washington, this statement is likely to be close to the truth. Therefore, before taking decisive action against the Dutch East Indies, the Japanese side must have the resolve to fight the United States. Although strong rhetoric toward the U.S. has been heard from time to time, knowledgeable Japanese have gradually realized the danger of blindly acting rashly. The Japanese government has been quite cautious in its attitude toward the Dutch East Indies issue, and even now that negotiations have stalled, it has still not taken immediate action. This is naturally due to the various difficulties it sees ahead and a reflection of various cautious views.</p>
<p>Therefore, even though the Japanese side has decided to recall its representatives in the Dutch East Indies, it still hopes that the situation can be resolved through concessions from the Dutch East Indies. At present, the situation no longer depends on the Japanese-Dutch negotiations themselves, but on the overall international situation and the course of the war.</p>

The Japanese troops stationed east of Tongling, including Lianyushan and Wuyutang north of Qingyang, launched attacks on the Chinese side. Fierce fighting has broken out in the mountainous areas east of Qingyang, including Muzhen and south of Suyushan. On the 11th, Japanese aircraft also came to assist in the battle.

<p>Gutian - The Chinese army achieved significant results in the battle to recapture Dahu, a key point northwest of Fuzhou, at the end of last month. Guo Cuixiong, the commander of a certain regiment, personally directed the troops during the battle to seize Shuangshan Heights near Dahu, leading by example. Unfortunately, he was shot in the left flank, but he continued to fight bravely. When Guo fell, the soldiers immediately seized the Japanese machine gun that had shot him and captured all six gunners. Guo's coffin was transported to a certain place yesterday, where it was greeted by local organizations offering flowers. At the same time as Guo's death, Feng Yusheng, a platoon leader of a certain Chinese unit, entered the Japanese position alone after the Japanese soldiers occupied a certain high ground. Feng was stabbed by two Japanese soldiers. Knowing that he had no hope of survival, Feng detonated a grenade, killing himself and the two Japanese soldiers. In addition, a certain soldier, after suffering three serious injuries, still carried a heavy machine gun and a rifle back to the original position. What is commendable is that the wounded officers and soldiers of the Chinese army in this battle all brought back some of their weapons and captured valuable spoils of war, demonstrating the high morale and courage of the Chinese soldiers.

<p>Washington President Roosevelt submitted to Congress the first report describing the situation in which the United States provided supplies to Britain, China, and other democratic nations under the Lend-Lease Act. It stated that in the first five months of this year, the number of aircraft shipped to Britain increased twelvefold compared to the same period last year, and aircraft engines increased tenfold. Currently, more heavy bombers and medium bombers are being shipped. In terms of value, explosives increased seventeenfold and arms and ammunition increased ninetyfold in the first quarter of this year. As of the end of May, the main allocations under the Lend-Lease Act included 88,000,000 yuan for the purchase of arms and other items, 318,000,000 yuan for tanks and other vehicles, and 551,000,000 yuan for ships. Long-range bombers, ships, tanks, and other war equipment needed for the defense of democratic nations have been ordered separately. The remaining funds are insufficient by 2,750,000,000 yuan and will be allocated as soon as possible. Britain has already received surplus American rifles, machine guns, field guns, aircraft, and ammunition, worth over 43,000,000 yuan. This equipment arrived in Britain after the Dunkirk evacuation. The effect of the arrival of these supplies on Britain's summer resistance cannot be estimated. In this report, the President stated, "American aid can enable Britain to surpass the Axis powers in terms of armaments. We must ensure that these armaments can be safely used to defeat the aggressors. From March 11 to May 21, the output of tools was [zero] yuan. Although this number is small, the export of war equipment to Britain has gradually increased since September 1939. In the future, we will supply more aircraft, artillery, ammunition, and other war equipment to Britain, China, and other democratic nations resisting aggression. Facts and numbers will only be disclosed to the extent that they are available, without revealing military secrets that would benefit the Axis powers. These facts only indicate the past and present state of American aid to democratic nations, but do not represent the most important fact. But the most important fact is the American people's strong determination to prevent aggressive violence from dominating the world. Our current goal is not only for our current security, but also for our future survival. We have begun the large-scale supply program necessary to defeat the Axis powers. To make it effective, all the aid we give must be multifaceted. Ships are necessary to carry war equipment and food. We are now enabling Britain to obtain ships—oil tankers with a gross tonnage of 2 million tons—but this number is still insufficient. We must maintain full shipping capacity every day from now on. Since the appropriations bill was passed, 550,000,000 yuan has been allocated for the construction of new ships, and the new methods needed to build these new ships are also being completed. Allied ships are now being repaired by us, equipped by us to protect against naval mines, and armed by us to defend against piracy. British warships are also being repaired by us so that they can quickly resume their maritime duties," he said. (12th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Strengthening Defenses to Cope with Air Raids</p>
<p>London Lord Beaverbrook, former Minister of Aircraft Production, stated in the House of Lords yesterday for the first time in his capacity as Minister of State, "There are various reasons to expect that enemy bomber attacks will become more frequent, but we have strengthened and improved our defenses to prepare for them." He also congratulated his successor on the record-breaking high production of aircraft and engines in May. During the debate on civil defense, Lord Strabolgi advocated unifying the various defense agencies under the sole jurisdiction of one minister. Beaverbrook did not agree with this view, saying that the duties handled by the ministers of various departments are extremely heavy and complex, and it is not advisable to merge them for the sake of national interest. Lord Astor suggested subsidizing civilians after air raids. He replied that production is far more important than the impact of air raids on civilians. In any situation, production must continue as much as possible. The army defends the country to resist imminent aggression, so priority should be given to the army's accommodation, and then consider the civilians' housing. (12th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>London The British and Free French forces, advancing in five routes, have again made great strides and are forming a घेराव position in Syria. The capture of Beirut and Damascus is generally expected to be completed in the previous two days, but it has been delayed due to unexpectedly fierce French resistance. However, this morning, this resistance, except for those surrounding Damascus, seems to have been largely overcome. One team advancing along the coast, after fierce fighting north of the Litani River, is reportedly a few miles outside Sidon, about twenty miles from Beirut. The third team is either on the outskirts of Damascus or has advanced to a location closer to Kisweh, about ten miles from Damascus. The fourth team, starting from the Iraqi border city of Abu Kamal, has reportedly advanced eighty miles. The fifth team is advancing along a road parallel to the Syrian border.

<p>London According to the latest war report from Syria, the Imperial military divisions attacking Syria from Palestine continue to make satisfactory progress. Two columns of British troops advancing from Iraq have penetrated deep into Syria. According to Ankara radio, a brigade of British mechanized troops advancing along the south bank of the Euphrates River occupied Deir ez-Zor, seventy miles from the Iraqi border, yesterday. Ankara military commentators said that the location is a military key point, from which one can reach Aleppo to the north and Palmyra and Damascus to the southwest, but this news and the news that the second British column from Iraq has penetrated one hundred miles into Syria, as reported by Ankara, have not yet been verified by London. The Vichy forces seem to be putting up a major resistance on the coastal road to Beirut and in front of Damascus. It is reported that fighting in the coastal area is still taking place north of the Litani River. Vichy troops have dug trenches in predetermined positions to hold the area. According to a Middle East British radio broadcaster, various Australian armored vehicles occupied Tyre and crossed the Litani River and are now advancing north, encountering French armored troops. In the first engagement, Australian troops destroyed two enemy tanks. It is reported that the Australian troops in the area had just arrived in the Middle East a short time ago. These people are well trained and equipped, but most have never seen battle. (12th Reuters dispatch)</p>

The French defense line defending the British invasion in the Hasbaya Valley was broken through. Another team of British troops on the east bank of the Jordan River attacking Damascus made no progress, because the French army counterattacked frequently.

<h3 id="e38">Hawaii Still Needs Greater Air Defense, More American Flying Fortresses Arrive, Large Food Warehouses Under Construction <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Honolulu – Lieutenant General Short, commander of the U.S. Army in Hawaii, told the Associated Press yesterday that modern tactics are constantly changing, making it necessary to further strengthen the air defense and anti-aircraft artillery of Hawaii, which has become one of the most heavily fortified areas in the world. Short said that in the past 20 years, the War Department has allocated more funds for the defense of Hawaii than for any other defense area. As a result, Hawaii's defense engineering has made it one of the most heavily fortified areas in the world. However, the constant emergence of modern tactics has shown that Hawaii needs to further increase its air defense. The War Department's announcement that it will transfer 21 "Flying Fortress" bombers to Hawaii has indicated the department's intention to strengthen air defenses there. We recall that when the Flying Fortresses arrived in Hawaii, the War Department also revealed that more Flying Fortresses would be shipped later, and that the U.S. forces stationed in Hawaii have also been substantially strengthened due to the addition of modern-style destroyers and light bombers. Short also said, however, that until we know what form the world situation will take, we cannot say that Hawaii is fully equipped to cope with any situation. Short also said that although 36 percent of Hawaii's residents are Japanese or Americans of Japanese ancestry, there is no racial discrimination between army personnel and the mixed Hawaiian residents, and there are no factors that could lead to racial conflict. He also said that although many of the soldiers drafted in Hawaii are Americans of Japanese ancestry, there are no racial opinions among the enlistees in the Hawaiian military. The actions of soldiers of Japanese ancestry and their enthusiasm in their work are sufficient to prove that they are all loyal. The descendants of Japanese in Hawaii not only do not oppose the U.S. drafting their children into the military, but also regard the fact that their children are engaged in defense training as an honor. Regarding the defense cooperation between the public and the military, Short repeatedly stated the four main facts of public preparation that he had previously mentioned, namely: (1) producing and storing food; (2) organizing medical and nursing teams to treat and care for wounded soldiers; (3) organizing auxiliary police to protect public utilities and prevent sabotage; and (4) preparing plans for evacuating women and children and establishing air-raid shelters for workers near major industrial areas. Short also revealed that the local army is taking steps to deal with the food shortage problem, stating that the army has been authorized by the higher authorities to build a huge underground warehouse capable of holding 2 million pounds of grain, and that the plan for refrigeration engineers to build a 175,000-cubic-foot warehouse has been underway for several months. Two million pounds of grain may be enough to supply the residents of Oahu Island for eight days in normal times, and may last several more days in the event of famine. Short also said that various news reports have indicated that residents in various areas are experiencing a severe shortage of food. In addition, news from Washington indicates that the federal government is likely to provide substantial assistance in the near future. (Associated Press, 12th)</p>

The solution announced by the Washington National Defense Mediation Board on Tuesday night, which stipulates that all workers should receive a wage increase of one cent per hour, was passed by the union yesterday afternoon. Yesterday, leaflets were distributed stating that President Roosevelt outwardly scolds Hitler, but inwardly imitates Hitler's tricks to suppress male and female laborers. Today, shopkeepers in the store will be ordered to shoot their union comrades while wearing uniforms. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

<p>London – London officially announced last night that British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Cripps, who recently left Moscow and flew to Britain via Sweden, has arrived in the UK. The British Foreign Office released the following statement: "British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Cripps, who has returned home for consultations, has arrived in the UK. Undersecretary of State Butler and Foreign Secretary's representative Mallet were at the airport to welcome him." The British ambassador is here at Eden's request and will return to his post after a few days. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>London – After British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Cripps arrived in London yesterday, diplomatic activities in various European capitals have intensified. It is now believed that the Ambassador will discuss with Foreign Secretary Eden the undecided attitude of Germany towards the Soviet Union, to decide on Britain's relationship with the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, according to news from Ankara, the Soviet Ambassador to Turkey is now on his way home. According to news from Madrid, the Spanish Foreign Minister recently received the ambassadors of Britain, the United States, Italy, Germany, and Chile, and the chargé d'affaires of Turkey. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>London – Diplomatic correspondents for London's morning newspapers discuss possible developments on the German-Soviet border. The Times states that on the surface, everything seems quiet between Germany and the Soviet Union. Hitler and Stalin may have different dreams, but because there is a friendly alliance, both sides speak of faithfully adhering to this alliance when they mention it. However, this is the surface appearance of the official arena and cannot hide the truth. According to news from various parts of Europe, Hitler is now deliberately pushing relations with the Soviet Union to a serious point. In recent weeks, he has mobilized large numbers of troops and deployed them on the Soviet border from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. This plan is by no means secret, and Hitler has even indicated to guests that the German side is confident of success. We think it is just a scare tactic. The News Chronicle said that if the news coming from European capitals under German control is reliable, then there will be significant changes in Soviet-German relations within a week or a few weeks. The intention of Germany to invade the Soviet Union should be kept secret, but the German side is openly talking about it. Why is that? Many diplomatic observers find it puzzling. As for the gathering of troops on the border, no matter what the purpose, there is no doubt that Germany is determined to coerce the Soviet Union to supply Germany with large quantities of oil and grain, regardless of the needs of its own people and economy. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Stockholm – Private news from Helsinki yesterday stated that 10,000 German troops have arrived in Finland and have established a headquarters there. (Associated Press, 12th)</p>
<p>London – Reliable sources say that Soviet Ambassador to the UK Maisky recently told British Foreign Secretary Eden that the Soviet Union has not concluded any secret agreements with Germany. The Soviet Ambassador assured Eden during a recent conversation with him that the Soviet Union is not currently engaged in any economic, political, military, or other negotiations with Germany. Prior to the Soviet Ambassador giving this assurance, there had been widespread rumors in diplomatic circles that the Soviet Union had negotiated with Germany, and some had even said that it had concluded an agreement with Germany, making huge economic concessions to Germany, and even dividing Iraq, Iran, and the rest of the Near East into Soviet and German spheres of influence.

<h3 id="e50">Public Sale of Rice, Including the Ka Min Tang Rice <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for foreign rice initially fell and then stabilized, with the situation still not breaking free from the oscillating pattern. Prices initially fell by two or three yuan, then rebounded by one or two yuan, but ultimately closed slightly lower by one or two yuan. Repurchased goods of Inghua Co.'s original-packaged rice were being hoarded and released by customers, further weakening the market. This was because the market opened weak after several days of fatigue, and people were very apprehensive due to the large amount of existing stock and the huge quantity of new orders. In addition to the originally designated small polished rice, the Shanghai Municipal Council's public sale of rice has now expanded to include Ka Min Tang rice as a public sale at a flat price. About 500 tons, or about 5,000 bags, have already been approved for sale, with merchants purchasing them at a price of 127 yuan and 25 cents, plus a profit and expenses of 9 yuan and 5 cents, totaling 136 yuan and 30 cents. The retail price is usually 2 yuan higher than the small polished rice, at 112 yuan. The public sale will commence as soon as the rice arrives, further unsettling people and causing the market price to fall by two or three yuan. Subsequently, merchants and inland buyers helped with flat-price purchases, and their appetite was strong, and the market immediately turned from fatigue to stabilizing, so the result was only a slight drop of one or two yuan. Inghua Co.'s broken rice opened at 105 yuan and 50 cents and 105 yuan, small polished rice ranged from 136 to 37 yuan to 135 yuan and 50 cents, and No. 1 Saigon rice was at 136 to 37 yuan, with a turnover of 700 to 800 tons. The current rice offerings were between 13,000 and 14,000 bags.</p>
<p>Thick japonica domestic rice, which had been barely maintaining a stable price for the past two days, finally succumbed to the lack of sales in the local market and softened, opening at 134 to 35 yuan for fresh early and late rice from Nanhui, 132 yuan for ordinary rice, 130 yuan for old rice, and 129 yuan, 112 yuan for old original-packaged rice, and 121 to 119 yuan for original-packaged old japonica rice from Wuxi, a drop of about 2 yuan.</p>
<p>After rising continuously for days, the market for foreign glutinous rice seemed to have satisfied its demand, and those holding goods gradually released them, so the market supply slightly increased. But things are valued when they are scarce, and now that the market has suddenly turned strong, people have become slack, and the sales channels for rice meals and cake shops have immediately weakened, creating a situation of oversupply, and the market has turned soft, with all prices falling by one or two yuan. Hong Kong special round-grain rice was selling for 114 to 15 yuan, long-grain rice for 113 yuan, then down to 111 yuan and 50 cents, rice for 102 to 3 yuan, domestic glutinous rice for 110 yuan, then down to 116 to 17 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Flour Market Rises Again with Speculation <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The flour market was initially fatigued and then tightened. When the market opened in the morning, it was depressed due to the tepid appetite in the local market. Jindong flour from the Pudong warehouse only opened at 28 yuan and 50 cents. Around noon, a local merchant bought 500 bags of Jindong flour from the Puxi warehouse for 28 yuan and 50 cents. The situation suddenly tightened in the afternoon, as news of the tense situation in the Dutch East Indies made the foreign flour price unsustainable, and rumors spread that the news of new wheat arriving in Shanghai was false, which prompted speculators to actively hoard purchases. The price of Jindong flour suddenly rose to 29 yuan and 20 cents, then 30 cents and 40 cents, up to 50 cents, with nearly 10,000 bags traded. The price of Clock Tower brand Australian flour, which was also scarce, also opened at 31 yuan, reportedly from a dealer distributing a certain quantity. It was said that all of it was sold locally, and that no more flour was available for sale at 31 yuan.</p>
<p>Trading in wheat was still sluggish, and industry operators confirmed that rumors were inaccurate. According to discussions within the industry, there were concerns about the impact of propaganda, and the market had indeed been significantly affected. The problem of new wheat arriving in Shanghai is now under control, and hopes have been dashed for the time being. Efforts are currently being made to find a solution.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Miscellaneous Grains and Bean Cakes Plunge <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of corn continued to plunge by 1 yuan and 70 to 80 cents. In stark contrast to the previous horizontal jump and surge, the current trend is one of downstream selling in an environment of oversupply. A total of more than 2,000 bags were traded yesterday, with Saigon goods priced at 25 yuan and 50 cents to 24 yuan and 70 cents, Dutch yellow corn priced at 26 yuan and 70 cents to 26 yuan, and white corn priced at 25 yuan and 40 cents to 24 yuan and 50 cents. Inghua Co.'s spot goods were priced at 44 yuan and 70 cents. There were no special sales channels for bean cakes. Short sellers of forward bean cakes are pressuring the market for distant futures, which have fallen to 19 yuan. The activity of long positions has been difficult to revive. Three truckloads of Fei Zi brand spot cakes were traded at a price of 17 yuan and 10 cents. Sheng Ji cakes opened at 34,000 to 35,000 pieces, priced at 17 yuan and 85 cents to 17 yuan and 70 cents for the May upper warehouse ticket for June delivery, and 18 yuan and 20 cents to 10 cents and 50 cents for the May lower warehouse ticket for June delivery, then rising to 18 yuan and 40 cents, before falling back to 17 yuan and 80 cents at closing. The June upper warehouse ticket for June lower delivery was at 19 yuan and 10 cents to 10 cents and 50 cents, then falling back to 18 yuan and 70 cents at closing. On the 13th, 200 bags of soybeans and 2,240 pieces of bean cakes will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the exchange rates of the various currencies listed by HSBC remain level. The black market for the Sterling-US dollar exchange rate saw little change, with only the current month's US exchange rate softening briefly due to speculators covering short positions, closing at 5.34375 yuan. Upon hearing news of the tense situation in the Dutch East Indies, with Japan claiming that it would fulfill its obligations under the Tripartite Pact, Chinese merchants shifted to selling at midday, returning to a level exchange rate by midday. However, the price of sterling softened to 3 pence 296875. No trading occurred in the afternoon, and the prices remained stagnant, closing tighter than the previous day for sterling, level for the US dollar. The volume of transactions throughout the day was extremely low.</p>

The listed exchange rates of the Central Bank were level. The opening buying price of the bank for the domestic market was 3 pence 3125 for spot sterling and 5.375 yuan for the US dollar. The situation was stable after opening, with 5.375 yuan still available for speculators for the July rate. However, due to HSBC suddenly stopping supply after supplying the June rate, with importers buying in, the rate softened to 5.34375 yuan. HSBC's listed rates for various currencies were level. The silver balancing tax continued to be levied at 25.75 percent, trending towards stagnation. Until near noon, tensions escalated in the Dutch East Indies, and Chinese banks slightly offloaded, while speculators switched to selling the July rate at 5.40625 yuan, resulting in the US dollar re-closing at 5.375 yuan, and sterling at 3 pence 296175.</p>
<p>More Observers in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The situation trended towards stagnation in the afternoon, with most Chinese and foreign commercial banks and speculators remaining on the sidelines.

<h3 id="e54">Gold Market Listless Before Exchange; Settled Price Only Made Ten Yuan, Longs in Current Session Have Difficulty Employing Usual Tactics <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw a dark market with fluctuating prices, rising first and then falling. Although the exchange for the current session will be held at 8:00 AM tomorrow, the listed prices of HSBC Small and Standard Chartered Bank were the same as the black market, both settling at 5.375, which is 6,479 yuan. If it still stands at the original price today, it will only decrease by ten yuan. The premium offered to buyers was also only ten yuan or so. The longs had difficulty employing their usual tactics. Moreover, with negative news in both the forward and spot markets, the Dutch East Indies situation was tense again, and the Japanese representative declared that the Tripartite Pact would be implemented, along with rumors of the withdrawal of Japanese bridges. Therefore, the securities firm Defu and the silver firm Heng Kee Jin raised the price to 6,489 yuan, and the settled price was also raised. Soon after, remittance merchants engaged in large-scale arbitrage selling. Under the influence of negative news, the price gradually fell. In the afternoon, at the current rate, Shi He even sold more than a thousand taels, dropping to 6,461 yuan, and finally only hedged a slight three yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 14,500 taels. People's hearts were slightly uncertain.

<p>Yesterday, the premium on exchange drafts and notes over cash had fallen from one yuan per thousand to par, hedging a small amount of about half a yuan. The interbank lending rate of the Money Dealers' Association remained unchanged, with both morning and afternoon markets quoting three points.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Public Bonds and Hot Money Already Responding <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The dark market for public bonds continued to rise. Category C bonds had broken through the 70 yuan mark, and other types had also surged by one level. The financial community's appetite was even stronger. Banks such as Guohua and Women's Bank, following Jin Cheng, absorbed funds on a large scale. The abundant liquidity further proved that this was the only outlet for hot money. As the half-year interest period was approaching, current purchases already included four and a half months of interest. Yesterday, Da Zhong, on behalf of a certain bank, bought in enthusiastically. Xie Da, Lian Yi, Heng Kang, Fu Xing, Xin Chang, Yi Chang, and Lian He all bought in successively. Xie Da sold Category E bonds, and the rest was supplied by scattered retail investors. Market prices gradually rose, with Category C bonds breaking through the 70 yuan mark. Xie Da continued to buy. Run De, Yi Chang, Tong Shun, Qian Yi, Li Feng, Yi Zhong, and Le Mao were all buyers. Transactions expanded further. On the selling side, Xin Chang, Hu He Ji, and Yong Kang were more active. Lian He and Ren Feng sold first and then bought back. The rest was supplied by general retail investors short selling. As a result, prices rose again by three to nine cents, and the total transaction volume was approximately 3.5 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock transactions: 50 shares of San You Shi Ye Company were traded at a price of 23 yuan.</p>
<p>The opening trend of the Zhongye stock market was strong, with slight reactions after entry. The prices of various stocks have recovered and advanced. Xiangtai shares have recently risen sharply, and yesterday, they rose to a high of 51.5 yuan, closing at 51 yuan. The total transaction volume was considerable. Only rubber stocks remained sluggish.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Yarn and Cotton; Shorts Struggling But Still Forceful; Yarn Market Lingering <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, and the trend remained firm. At the same time, Hong Kong merchants continued to relentlessly demand Shuang Ma yarn, so sentiment was good, and there was a sense of lack of chips on the market. The short exchange rate was still quoted at half a cent, and the longs did not pay the interest rate, but had income and profits, so they had a stronger desire to go long. However, some argued that there were many buyers and they were deeply afraid of not being able to benefit from the longs, so small companies were still struggling on the short side. After the market price rose, it fell back down. Generally speaking, the market may still have the possibility of seeing 1,450 yuan. Today's trend has shown obvious signs of lingering. In short, the fundamental problem must rely on actual sales as the first priority. The high price for 20-count Shuang Ma was 1,475 yuan, and the low price was 1,458 yuan. The initial momentum in the afternoon was very high, at 1,471 yuan, rising to 74 yuan. After that, the securities firms came out and gradually fell to 1,460 yuan. The final price was 1,465 yuan. Today, 635 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Although the opening momentum of Shuang Ma was tight, retail investors cashed in their profits. The opening price was 1,465 yuan, with more sellers than buyers, and it loosened to 1,458 yuan. Then it was heard that Guang merchants Sheng Yuan and Sheng Mu were trading Shuang Ma more actively, and the buying momentum was particularly strong. The market price rose step by step, rising to 1,475 yuan. Those who made profits in the middle closed out, and it loosened again to 1,464 yuan. The closing price returned to 1,472 yuan. According to statistics, 9,800 bales were traded in half a day, of which 1,300 bales were purchased by Hong Kong merchants and 8,500 bales by domestic merchants.</p>
<p>The Shuang Ma standard yarn market was relatively flat. In the middle, due to good sales of spot yarn, it also saw an increase, but it weakened slightly in the afternoon. As a result, the July contract fell by 5 cents, and the August contract fell by 2 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 9,150 bales. The high, low, and closing prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Cotton Prices Advance; Trading Booms <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton market was even more prosperous, and sentiment remained excited. This was because factory demand was strong, and the rise in American cotton was even more intense, resulting in extraordinary prosperity for the public, and the trading volume suddenly surged. Especially fine lint raw materials have become the center of advancement, and prices have also increased by more than ten yuan. Coarse lint was also raised a lot. Yesterday, a total of 2,150 pieces and 198 bales were traded.</p>
<p>Another message: the Shanghai Bund foreign cotton trading, sentiment was excited, the market was lively, because overseas procurement was quite troublesome, at the same time American cotton repeatedly rose, and the yarn market situation has been unfolded in a favorable condition in recent days, predict the future of the cotton market, it should be prosperous undoubtedly.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market, due to weather reports favorable to the long side, and good cotton cloth trade situation, fellow industry members bought very hard, therefore the market situation repeatedly lively firm increase, as a result the closing price, compared to the previous day, rose 17 to 25 pounds (British) or so.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market, first fell due to scattered retail selling and continuous switching of contracts by buyers, but then rose again due to speculators covering white rots for new blooms. Yesterday's closing price, except for white rots for July and August falling half a rupee, the rest rose by 1 to 4 rupees. It is also predicted that today's opening market situation will be 2.5 rupees higher.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Piece Goods; Trend Flat <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The factory cloth market yesterday was stable. Nanyang merchants continued to purchase vigorously. Coarse cloth factory plates were not loose, and the prices of hand-held goods rose again, by 1.5 to 5 cents per piece. Fine cloth twill bleached and dyed cloth was flat. Shangshen poplin, such as the warp and weft factory's 80-count and 60-count goods, all rose by 1 to 2 yuan per piece. About 200 pieces of various cloths were traded in this street. Nanyang merchants purchased about 200 pieces of lightweight coarse cloth bleached cloth, etc.</p>
<p>The East Market was flat without honor or disgrace. Although the price of Shuang Ma yarn rose frequently, it still could not arouse the interest of hoarders. Fellow merchants also sold at high prices and had no desire to enter, so the closing price of the leading fine cloth store, Baihuo, was 44 yuan, 7 jiao, and 7.5 cents, only rising by 2.5 cents. Four Gentlemen serge circulated at around 1 yuan, 4 jiao, and 5 fen, with the evening closing price at 1 yuan, 4 jiao, 5 fen, and 1.25 li.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Sugar Market; Exchange Sugar Settlement Price Official Method; Has Not Yet Been Publicly Announced <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The Sugar Industry Association's futures sugar dispute was resolved through public discussion and settlement, but the resolution has not yet been publicly announced. Therefore, there is no lack of opportunities to deceive customers. For customers whose short positions are profitable, the settlement method of the association is used as an excuse to reduce the profits they should have received. For customers whose long positions lose money, the method of reducing the price is omitted, and the settlement price is generally 93 yuan, or the transaction is settled flat without settlement, and they still have to pay all the losses. Therefore, some customers have expressed dissatisfaction and hope that the association will publicly announce the resolution to avoid confusion and trickery.</p>
<p>The sugar market was weak at first and then tight yesterday, and as a result, there was not much ups and downs. The Association's drawing rate, spot 24 coarse white, the initial price of new goods from foreign stores was only 89 yuan, then it turned tight to 89.5, 90, and 91 yuan. The 3/4 month old goods opened the weakest, only 86 yuan, then rose to 87, 88, and 89.5 yuan. Dutch red remained soft at 68 yuan, 2 yuan smaller. Tai Koo Cart White was without weight, B mark 108 yuan, DY mark 95 yuan, HX mark 88 to 89 yuan, the factory's first ice 124 yuan, Jingming ice 125 yuan, National Sugar reported from customers, because the domestic sales price was higher, so although it was shen, it was said that Dia Qing's transportation to Shantou even reached 88 yuan, and white sugar was 145 yuan, so the price difference was very large.</p>

<p>Longxi produced longan, the texture is also not bad, but the particles are smaller only. According to a letter from the production area, the new flower seedlings are very thin, only 10% to 20%, so the price of old goods is very tight. If the wholesale sector will carry out autumn sales activities in the future, the future market looks promising.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Municipal Council Actually Approved; British Tram Company to Increase Fares; Scheduled to Be Implemented on the 28th of This Month; Salary Increase Proposal for Council Members Has Not Yielded Results <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The British-owned Shanghai Electric Construction Company and Tramways Company, in the Concessions, had previously made excuses of high prices and insufficient income and expenditure, and repeatedly increased prices in order to obtain more profits. Recently, the price of rice has been suppressed by the authorities purchasing and transporting foreign rice to Shanghai, and other prices have also fallen. In theory, these public transportation enterprises should also automatically reduce prices to reduce the burden on citizens. However, the Tramways Company instead used the excuse that the exchange rate continued to fall and expenses increased, making it difficult to maintain operations, and requested another price increase. As a result, the public opposed it. Unexpectedly, the Municipal Council meeting the day before approved the proposal and scheduled it to be implemented on the 28th of this month. Therefore, the burden on the general public will not only not be reduced in the future, but will also increase compared to the past. There is a deep regret over the Municipal Council's move. The Municipal Council's announcement issued yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<p>Tram Price Increase Scheduled for Implementation</p>
<p>According to the Municipal Council's announcement, the Shanghai Electric Construction Company presented that due to the continuous decline in the exchange rate, coupled with the impact of the foreign war situation, various operating expenses have not increased sharply, making it difficult to maintain operations. Therefore, a request has been submitted to the Bureau for permission to increase tram fares, which is calculated as an increase from an average of 6.37 cents per mile to 9.11 cents for the first class, and from an average of 4.87 cents per mile to 7.29 cents for the third class, to increase revenue and supplement funds. It is found that the company's income has failed to meet the increase in expenditures since 1917. At present, expenses are about three times more than in 1937, of which a significant part is the electricity bill, which has increased more than four times. However, during the same period, the number of fare increases was only 153%, which caused the company's net profit from investment to decrease year by year. This net profit, which was 8.5% in 1936, was reduced to 1.3% last year. After the Bureau's Public Utilities Committee held a meeting to discuss, it was considered that the requested price increase was in compliance with the provisions of the franchise agreement and should be approved. It has been forwarded to the Bureau's Board of Directors for approval at the regular meeting on the 11th of this month and will be implemented from June 28th.</p>
<p>Salary Increase for Staff Decided</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the Municipal Council has not reached a resolution on the salary increase proposal submitted by the Council's銓敘委員会. The salary increase issue will be discussed again at the next regular meeting. It is not yet possible to know for sure, but reliable sources indicate that the discussion of salary increases will be postponed indefinitely. It is reported that the銓叙委員会 proposed to increase the living allowance of 150% for all Council members, but it is not clear how much the increase will be. Some say it will be increased to 170%, while others say it will be doubled.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Asiatic Petroleum Company Downsizing; Waterworks Labor Unrest Rises; Chinese Business Labor Modifies Conditions <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the various unresolved labor-management disputes were still under negotiation. The Asiatic Petroleum Company had a dispute over downsizing, and the comrades of the Commercial Press made concessions on the conditions, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Asiatic Petroleum Company</p>
<p>The authorities of the British-owned Asiatic Petroleum Company in the city have said that they are going to downsize staff. Upon hearing the news, the staff were shocked and uneasy. After a meeting, they delegated representatives to present three requests to the company's manager, Mr. Bouville: (1) Each laid-off employee should be given 2,000 yuan in severance pay; (2) The savings deposits should be given out; (3) Those who continue to serve should have their salaries increased by a certain amount. The company was required to give a satisfactory reply by noon today, otherwise the staff may take drastic action.</p>
<p>Water Company</p>
<p>After the labor unrest occurred among more than 200 temporary workers of the British-owned Yangshupu and Jiangxi Road Water Companies, at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning, more than 80 temporary workers gathered at the gate of the water company's storage place on Xinzha Road, demanding a response from the management. However, the office said that it had no right to respond, and because the workers were gathering in increasing numbers, which was hindering work, it telegraphed the police to send a large number of detectives to disperse them. A dispute once occurred at the time, but fortunately, it did not cause any trouble.</p>
<p>Commercial Press</p>
<p>In the Commercial Press labor unrest, in order to show sincerity and seek a solution as soon as possible, the labor side revised the previous six articles into three: (1) Comrades who are laid off and those who are transferred and do not want to go will be given an additional year's salary (including rice subsidies and temporary salary increases) and the arrears of wages after the August 13th Incident will be returned, but if the total of the two items is less than 1,200 yuan, it will be made up to that amount; (2) When the company needs to add staff in its business, it should absolutely employ the comrades who were laid off and those who were transferred and did not want to go this time. Only after all the above-mentioned comrades have been employed may new staff be hired. Before the above-mentioned comrades have been fully employed, the company's work may not be contracted out to parties outside the company; (3) Maintain the minimum wage rate for existing comrades. Please forward it to the labor party by the industrial section of the labor bureau, according to the industrial section, provisions 1 and 3 can still be consulted, company no. 2 has repeatedly firmly stated that there is no need to talk any more about this. The labor party considers that this provision should not be rejected by the company in terms of morality and reason, because the labor party is aware of the company's current difficulties and recognizes that it is reducing staff. In the future, when the company needs to add staff in its business, it would be better to employ old staff than to employ new staff, because they are familiar with the work and it would be beneficial and harmless to the company. Moreover, most of the staff have been working for more than 20 years. Once they leave, how can we bear it? Therefore, if this article is also rejected, it is obviously malicious, and the labor party will sacrifice everything to achieve its goals.</p>
<p>Shaphal Works Labor Unrest</p>
<p>All the workers of Shaphal Works demanded an increase of 1 yuan and 1 jiao per person per day for rice subsidies last month, but the management only agreed to 4 jiao, which led to labor unrest. The two sides have been deadlocked until now for more than half a month. It is now known that the labor unrest was resolved a few days ago, and each person will receive a uniform increase of 5 jiao per day for rice subsidies.</p>

<p>The four ships that were previously detained in the Zhoushan waters and later sailed to Shanghai, Changde, Ave Maria, Ammanley, and Baoli, could not regain their freedom because the Japanese did not allow them to unload their cargo. According to shipping industry news yesterday, the Ave Maria and Baoli have recently unloaded their cargo at the Yangshupu wharf under Japanese supervision. As for all the cargo, the Japanese considered it to be contraband and did not allow the shipping company or cargo merchants to claim it. Although the company has negotiated, it is still invalid. It is also known that the Japanese have stated that if they want to claim it, they must meet certain conditions, but the cargo merchants cannot do it because the losses are too great, and the water acquisition has not been resolved. Therefore, there is actually little hope of unconditionally recovering the cargo. As for the two ships, they have been released from supervision and are now moored at the Pujiang buoy. The cargo of the remaining Changde and Ammanley has not yet been unloaded. It is said that they are currently moored at the mouth of the Wusong River, and the Japanese do not allow them to unload their cargo there.</p>

<p>The Shanghai slaughtering industry, fresh meat industry, and slaughterhouse were approved by the Municipal Council Board of Directors to lease the Hongkou Shajing Road slaughterhouse. In the future, the pigs in the British and French Concessions will be slaughtered in a centralized manner. If this is implemented, the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people in the industry will be cut off. Representatives were elected to petition the Municipal Council. Because the lease of the slaughterhouse has not yet been signed, the Municipal Council agreed to find a way to provide relief. The industry has also negotiated, and in the future, the slaughter of pigs must be restored to the pre-war state. At the very least, the area south of the Suzhou River must maintain its current state. If the goal is difficult to achieve, the entire industry will be shut down. It is now known that this case has been considered and may be abolished the centralized slaughter of pigs.</p>

<p>Mr. Fritz Rittmuller, General Manager of Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, who resided in the Far East for several decades, passed away in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 6th of this month. His remains were buried on the 9th at the public cemetery on Jing'an Temple Road. He was born on March 14, 1874. After graduating from a local middle school, he entered a bank for an internship. Subsequently, in 1897, he joined the London branch of the old Deutsche Bank as a staff member. In May 1901, he began working at Deutsch-Asiatische Bank in Shanghai. After several years, he was promoted to director of the bank's Kobe office and was later appointed as a director. In 1901, he was appointed as the manager of the Yokohama branch. The following year, he served as acting manager of the Shanghai branch. In the same year, he married the youngest daughter of Mr. Du Hua of the French Municipal Council in Shanghai. From 1913 to 1935, he served as the manager of the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank in Qingdao. At that time, Qingdao was the German stronghold in the Far East. During the European War, Qingdao fell into Japanese hands, and he was captured and taken to Japan. After regaining his freedom, he returned to Qingdao to assist in the restoration of German commerce in China. Subsequently, he successively held the position of manager of Deutsch-Asiatische Bank in Hankou, Beiping, Kobe, and other places, and also held important positions in the Berlin branch. In 1934, he was ordered by the board of directors to inspect the branches of Deutsch-Asiatische Bank in the Far East and was subsequently appointed as the manager of the Tianjin branch. In January 1940, he was appointed as the manager of Deutsch-Asiatische Bank in Shanghai and concurrently as the general manager of the Far East. Mr. Rittmuller possessed extraordinary talent and foresight. He served Deutsch-Asiatische Bank for nearly 40 years, making outstanding contributions to the bank's planning and management, and made significant contributions to German commerce in the Far East. His sudden death is not only a great loss to the bank, but also deeply regretted by the Germans in the Far East, who have lost a leading figure.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Establishment of Land Finance Department, Issuance of Land Bonds, China Farmers Bank Ordered to Handle, An Important Step in Rectifying Land Registration <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The China Farmers Bank, under the order of the Ministry of Finance, has established a Land Finance Department with a stipulated capital of 10 million national currency, and has been formally established. Mr. Huang Tong is the director. The department has begun to provide long-term agricultural credit loans and has been specially approved by the government to issue land bonds. The types of loans are listed below:</p>
<p>Loan Types</p>
<p>(1) "Land Acquisition at Assessed Value" Loans: When the land value tax is implemented, people may underreport the value. Land administration agencies can request loans from the department to acquire land at the assessed value. Therefore, this type of loan aims to facilitate the implementation of the land value tax. (2) Land Expropriation Loans: The government sometimes needs to expropriate private land but is unable to provide fair compensation to landowners. If such loans are available, both the government and the people will benefit. (3) "Land Improvement Loans": For projects such as water conservancy and afforestation, the people's financial resources are limited, or the benefits are long-term. Therefore, the government needs to provide loans. (4) "Land Consolidation Loans": Land consolidation requires significant expenses, which private individuals cannot afford. Therefore, loans are needed. (5) "Loans to Support Owner-Cultivators": China has many tenant farmers. The government must use political and economic power to enable tillers to own their land. (6) "Land Registration Rectification Loans": Currently, land registration in many places needs rectification. After rectification, land tax revenue will definitely increase. However, due to insufficient funds, many projects have been shelved. Therefore, it is necessary to provide loans for this purpose.</p>

Shanghai), a Japanese director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, at 112 Rue Cardinal Foch, at approximately 12:30 AM last night (the 11th). The sound was very loud. This morning (the 12th), the French police and Japanese authorities have launched an investigation and have taken special precautions at the residences of Mr. Okamoto, a Japanese director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Mr. Yasuzo Yajima to prevent possible attacks. It is reported that no one was injured in the bombing, and only the walls suffered slight damage. According to this morning's reports, Japanese military police were the first to arrive at the scene after the incident and did not allow the French police officers who arrived later to investigate Mr. Hanaoka's residence. About an hour later, a Japanese major also arrived at the scene, and only then were four French police officers allowed to enter the residence to investigate jointly with the Japanese military police.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Insurance Industry to Discuss Preventing Car Theft, Due to Numerous Recent Car Theft Cases, Rumors of Increased Car Insurance Premiums Incorrect <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Recently, there have been widespread rumors that various insurance companies in Shanghai intend to increase car insurance premiums due to the numerous car theft cases. However, according to Mr. Sheehan, the manager of American International Assurance Company, yesterday told reporters that various insurance companies in Shanghai are not currently considering increasing car insurance premiums, as such a move would not reduce car theft. He said that although there are many car theft cases at present, the compensation paid by insurance companies is less than 2%. If insurance premiums were to be increased rashly for this reason, it would likely affect business prospects. In the past, when car theft cases occurred, they were often solved in a short period of time because thieves could not drive the cars out of Shanghai. However, the current situation is very different, and those stealing cars are organized gangs. It is said that they have the same keys for most new American-made cars in Shanghai, so car theft cases are frequently heard of. It is reported that the Insurance Association of America will soon hold a meeting to discuss this matter in order to take effective measures to prevent it.</p>

<p>In addition to Rangoon Small Grain Rice, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession is continuing to procure Rangoon Special Mandalay Rice at affordable prices to help the people and ensure that rice prices are not manipulated by rice merchants and raised again. According to sources from the Ping Ming News Agency, the special Mandalay Rice that the council plans to procure has already been agreed upon with the Hong Kong government and will soon be shipped to Shanghai. As for the selling price, the agency acting on behalf of the council for the affordable rice has already set it. The wholesale price to grain merchants is 127.2 yuan per bag. The grain merchants must not sell it to retail rice shops for more than 136.25 yuan per bag. The retail price at rice shops is 112 yuan per stone. It is found that in the Japanese rice market, the price of Mandalay Rice is 117 yuan per stone, and the retail price at rice shops is generally over 120 yuan. Because the cost incurred by the Municipal Council is lower, the selling price is only 2 yuan higher than that of Small Grain Rice.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Roulette Gambling Den Broken Up at 74 Nanyang Road, Operated by Two Englishmen on a Large Scale, Access by Password, Gamblers All Wealthy <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Detective Liao Hua of the Public Concession Police, along with Detective Feng Qishan and Western Detective Wahl, recently discovered that a large-scale roulette gambling den was secretly opened in the D-character apartment at 74 Nanyang Road. Those who went there to gamble were all business tycoons, including managers of banks and large companies. The gamblers all arrived in the latest luxurious cars. The winnings and losses were recorded by signing notes. Each night, the table stakes amounted to hundreds of thousands. The gambling den was exceptionally well-equipped, with passwords required for knocking on the door, making it extremely difficult for outsiders to enter.</p>
<p>Operated by Englishmen</p>
<p>After a long period of investigation by the police, the number was finally discovered. At 10:15 PM on the 11th, they managed to sneak in. The gamblers were in high spirits and gambling. The detectives then began to arrest the people in charge: two Englishmen, W. Hawkins (who was previously fined five pounds by the British Consulate for operating a gambling den in the Cangzhou Hotel) and V.L. Xavier; four Chinese assistants in charge of gambling equipment: Chen Baodi from Wuxi, Zhao Guiqing, Wang Haili from Tianjin, and Bi Fugen from Shanghai; and nineteen gamblers, both men and women. The gambling equipment and thousands of chips were also seized and taken to the police station.</p>
<p>Wealthy Gamblers</p>
<p>Because the gamblers were all business tycoons, most of the names they gave were false. The names they reported were Wang Beidi (female) from Guangdong, Guo Mali (female), Guo Daola (female) from Shanghai, Guo Qiaoqi and his wife, Wu Junli and his wife from Jian (all listed the address as 110 Avenue Haig), Hu Huarong from Suzhou (26 Avenue Joffre), Lu Xuefei and Mrs. Lu from Shanghai (3 Lane 592 Rue Amiral Bayle), Meng Chao from Suzhou (22 Lane 67 Rue Amiral Bayle), Shen Youbo and Shen Wangshi from Suzhou (11 Tranquility Lane Seymour Road), Guangdong women Lin Zhen, Lin Hui, Wu Zhi, Zhang Xin (134 Poplar Lane Rue du Lieutenant Petiot), Cantonese man Liu Andu and his wife (905 Yu Yuan Road).</p>
<p>Separate Lawsuits</p>
<p>After investigation by the police, the two Englishmen were handed over to the British Consulate for interrogation. The four Chinese assistants were detained. The nineteen gamblers were each allowed to post bail of 500 yuan to avoid detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, where Judge Meng Tingke presided over the hearing. After being released on bail, all the gamblers avoided appearing in court. Police lawyer Fang Fushu filed separate lawsuits on charges of assisting in the operation of a gambling den and gambling. He also stated that the property was owned by Wing Lee Real Estate Company and leased by an Englishman named Natto. Hogan, who was arrested, had admitted that Natto was his alias. However, the police knew that Hogan was not wealthy, and the gambling den was luxuriously equipped, which must have cost a lot of money. Therefore, they strongly believed that there must be a Chinese person as the behind-the-scenes boss.</p>
<p>Still Under Investigation</p>
<p>The situation was similar to the gambling dens broken up in the past. Therefore, the police need to investigate further and requested permission to postpone the hearing. Subsequently, Detective Feng Qishan reported the details of the case. Judge Meng interrogated the four, Chen Baodi. They were ordered to be detained and a new hearing was set for one week later. The police were also ordered to notify the defendants who had been released on bail that they must appear in court at the next hearing.</p>

<p>The electrical wires installed by the Shanghai Power Company in the eastern and western parts of Shanghai have recently been cut and stolen by petty thieves, causing losses not only to the company but also inconvenience to users. On the 7th of this month, the Wayside Police received a report that a criminal who cut and stole electrical wires was hiding in Tangshan Road. The police dispatched officers to the address and arrested one criminal and 200 feet of stolen wire. The criminal confessed to repeatedly cutting and stealing electrical wires and selling them in the concession and western Shanghai. Subsequently, more criminals and eighteen suspects were arrested, and a large number of stolen electrical wires were seized. The police are still continuing to investigate the case and intend to apprehend all the criminals who cut and steal electrical wires.</p>

<p>Pan Chen Shi, a widow from Changshu, is forty-one years old and lives in a bungalow in Qingcheng Lane, Rue Pere Robert in the French Concession. She has a daughter named Miao Gen, who is fourteen years old.

<p>at the house of Mr. Lin Qiu, but her deaf-mute daughter Miao Gen cannot always be by her side. She was worried about this and came up with a strange idea. On the 15th of last month, she lured her deaf-mute daughter Miao Gen to a riverbank in Hongqiao. Taking advantage of Miao Gen's unpreparedness, she suddenly pushed Miao Gen into the river to drown her and avoid being a burden. Fortunately, after falling into the water, Miao Gen shouted loudly, and was rescued by someone, while Pan</p>

<p>She was then sent to the Zhong Ci You Association and reported to the French police. It was not until recently that the French police found Pan Chen Shi's hiding place and arrested her. After investigation by the police, Pan Chen Shi confessed that she had no way to support her biological daughter due to the difficult living conditions, so she took this desperate measure. The police believe that Pan Chen Shi's actions are inhumane and have now filed a lawsuit against her according to law to show their deterrence.</p>

<p>(Dahua News Agency) All the faculty and staff of the affiliated elementary school of Shanghai Women's Middle School on Avenue du General Foch recently made four demands to the school due to the high cost of living: (1) The school should continue to issue employment letters before the major examination. (2) Each person should receive a subsidy of 100 yuan for living expenses this semester. (3) Salaries should be calculated for six months. (4) The employment letter should be for one year. Because the school did not respond, the faculty and staff went on strike yesterday morning at 8:00 AM. Even more unfortunately, the windows and doors of the school's office and principal's office were smashed by students, causing great chaos. Upon receiving the report, the police sent officers to the school and summoned the principal and four faculty members to the police station. After questioning them, they were released. At the same time, the school notified the students' parents that "the faculty of the elementary school of this school has unfortunately gone on strike. From today (the 12th), the elementary school will be temporarily suspended, while the middle school will continue as usual. We will notify you when the situation is resolved." The faculty members also have their own views, which have been distributed to the students' parents. According to reporters from Dahua News Agency, relevant parties are currently sending personnel to mediate, hoping to break the deadlock and resolve the situation as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Songjiang Girls' Middle School, located at 1246 Avenue Foch, was originally established in Songjiang and has long enjoyed a good reputation. Since moving to Shanghai, it has adhered to its past spirit and managed the school seriously. Therefore, the school's atmosphere is simple and the academic performance is outstanding, just as in the past. The school has always provided a number of free places for outstanding and needy former students. Recently, the school affairs meeting decided that needy new students with excellent entrance examination results will also be given free opportunities to benefit the needy. This is truly not a small gesture.</p>

<p>In the three matches of the Youth League Volleyball Tournament last night (the 11th), Jingshi defeated Huajiang in straight sets in Group B. In the women's group match between Minli and Jingwu, the battle was tense. Jingwu took the first set, but Minli fought back and won the next two sets in a row, reversing the defeat with a score of 2-1. In the final Group A match between Yinghua and Huxing, both sides had famous players and were evenly matched. Yinghua's main player, Zheng Yiquan, had rushed back from Hong Kong to help, which made the team even stronger. In the first set, Yinghua won with a score of 21-17 thanks to the smashes of Mai Bingyao and Zheng Yiquan. In the second set, the score was tied at 20-20, but Huxing finally won with a score of 22-20. In the third set, Huxing played smoothly and won with a score of 21-14. However, they lacked stamina, and Yinghua lost the next two sets in a row. In summary, Yinghua defeated Huxing with a score of 3-2. There will be no matches today due to the Youth League holding a Health Week event. The results of yesterday's matches are as follows:</p>

<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>This approach emphasizes the "ability" and "strength" of the teacher. It cannot be undertaken by teachers without special training and cultivation, and it is not easy to achieve results.</p>
<p>As for the textbook guidance method, the general mentality is to regard the teacher as a magician, hoping to completely rely on him to "turn stone into gold." This is probably a wrong mentality, because the teacher's responsibility is to guide and point out, not to manufacture. If you want to learn English well, nine-tenths of the work still depends on your own efforts and self-study. The so-called self-study is not a miserable pose of facing the wall for ten years, but a lively and interesting automatic work.</p>
<p>The above three conditions are all related to each other. Those who have not suffered hardships may not be able to experience it for a while. Those who have spun around and taken detours on the road of research will probably understand it at a glance. Next, let's examine the small shortcuts of reading, writing, speaking, and translating.</p>
<p>Read</p>
<p>(1) What to Read: Most of the school's textbooks are prescribed by the academic director and teachers and cannot be changed. Some schools are also very willing to respect the opinions of the students, and some teachers please the students, allowing them to choose textbooks at will. This is even more dangerous than prescribing textbooks. Young people's psychology is sometimes blind, sometimes fickle, and sometimes ambitious. These are all morbid mentalities.</p>
<p>I remember that students in a certain class in the past advocated reading English newspapers. The English in newspapers is extremely irregular and is listed as a taboo in rhetoric. New words, strange words, and obscure words are used, and even self-created words are used. Moreover, newspapers have their own documents, and nine out of ten are a bit glib. How can we learn from them? For example, it would be a joke to use cursive script as a model for learning calligraphy. Of course, there are occasionally neat articles in newspapers, but very few. As for learning some current affairs vocabulary, first ask if we need it.</p>
<p>Even magazine articles are generally not suitable for reading as textbooks. When you reach a certain level, you may be able to use publications such as Reader's Digest as supplementary reading material, but when you reach this level, our English knowledge may force us to explore better, more beautiful, and richer treasures.</p>
<p>What should we read after all? The simple answer is: (1) pure English, (2) standard textbooks and other reading materials compiled by standard authors, (3) selections suitable for your own level.</p>
<p>(2) How to Read: Our reading steps are often wrong. Nine and a half out of ten people first look up new words. After looking up the new words, they are already exhausted. This method is neither scientific nor logical. If we choose our textbooks appropriately, I believe that we should first read the entire article or chapter from beginning to end, once, twice, or three times. Although it may seem a bit superficial, it doesn't matter, because the purpose is to grasp the general meaning of the whole article. After grasping the general meaning, the second step is to find the paragraphs in the whole article (here, paragraph does not mean section). Mark each paragraph with a single word or a short sentence to indicate the subtitle. Then, the third step is to see how many sections are in this paragraph. Paragraphs and sections of short articles are mostly mixed. If it is a large paragraph, there may be two or three sections. We have to carefully find the main sentence of each section. This is not difficult, because in English writing, the main sentence of each section (that is, the main idea) is either the first sentence or the last sentence. It is rare to be hidden in the middle. Once we find the main sentence, we know what the section is about. Only then can we discuss each sentence in detail.</p>

<h3 id="e104">"Eating in Restaurants" Appeals: Plain Noodles Jump a Corner, Six Major Hurdles <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Disheng</p>
<p>Stir-fried Meat Like a Kite with a Broken String</p>
<p>I remember two years ago, during the spring, when I first fled to the isolated island of Shanghai and started "eating in restaurants," a bowl of "plain noodles" was only seven coppers, and it was filled to the brim. The rice grains were white, large, and genuine Du rice. Just two bowls would make my belly tight and full.</p>
<p>Stir-fried meat was also seven coppers a piece, moderately fatty and lean, and as big as a dried tofu block. So two pieces of stir-fried meat and two bowls of "plain noodles" were enough for a hearty meal, costing only a dime. It was both decent and practical, and the waiter would greet you warmly, treating you like an honored guest.</p>
<p>But good times don't last, and the situation has been deteriorating. The "plain noodles" jumped from seven coppers to seven cents a bowl, and then soared to "jump out of the dime barrier," reaching the current peak of sixteen cents. At the same time, corners were cut, the flat-bottomed bowl was changed to a pointed-bottom bowl, and Du rice was replaced with second-grade foreign indica rice. Hong Kong rice was also mixed with broken rice, which was shallow and very rough. It took three or five bowls to barely feel not hungry. I'm not lying; it's definitely not really full.</p>
<p>The stir-fried meat is getting smaller, smaller, and smaller, to the point where you can't tell if it's a "piece" or a "strand." If there were a strong storm, I believe this thin slice of meat might fly straight to the clouds like a kite with a broken string. Adding a small tip is, as usual, non-negotiable. Now, a meal costs not one yuan, but nine mao. This small tip is enough for a meal in the past. I am a little envious of the waiter's position and lament my own inferiority.</p>
<p>These days, newspapers report "rice prices plummeting" and "vegetables crashing," but our restaurant owners don't seem to be as quick to react as they were when prices were raised before. "Plain noodles" are still sixteen cents, and still served in a pointed-bottom bowl, and still shallowly filled. The stir-fried meat naturally has no hope of returning to its old appearance. Even the vegetables are still the old price of twenty cents, hard as nails! They always maintain their "genuine non-negotiable price."</p>
<p>As someone who "eats in restaurants," I sincerely appeal to the restaurant owners here: raise prices when they should be raised, and lower prices when they should be lowered. Please reduce your money-making calculations a little and ease the burden on us small eaters. Doing good is the greatest joy, and that would be a great merit.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Overture in Three Movements <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Hai Feng</p>
<p>In the past, when you met an acquaintance, the first thing you said was always, "The weather today is haha," and then; you laughed, I laughed, he laughed, and everyone laughed. It seemed that if you didn't open your mouth, you couldn't start any other way.</p>
<p>Now it's different. It's okay if you don't see people, but when you see people, you always unconsciously talk about life problems, and from life problems, you turn to the repeated breaking of rice price limits and the incessant rise in coal prices. Then, you sighed, I sighed, he sighed, and everyone sighed.</p>
<p>Recently, the rice from Hong Kong set by the Municipal Council has arrived, and the freight for transporting coal has also fallen. As a result, rice and coal prices have fallen sharply in recent days. Although the price of rice is still above 100, and the price of coal is still selling for fifteen or sixteen yuan per dan, it is still inseparable from the "real business" -- the difficulty of solving life problems. Everyone thinks that while rice prices are falling, the cost of living is rising instead, discussing each other, and finally you are angry, I am angry, he is angry, and everyone is angry.</p>

<p>Editor… We are also oppressed apprentices. Our wages range from four yuan to more than ten yuan per day. We work twelve hours a day, and our access to books and newspapers is extremely limited. In the past, for the sake of life, for the sake of obtaining the minimum amount of food to sustain life, we have always silently endured.</p>
<p>However, the bosses recently forced us to sign a so-called "voluntary agreement," the content of which is as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Must be between the ages of sixteen and twenty; be physically strong, have good character, have a junior high school education, and pass an examination. After a three-month trial period, they may become formal trainees.</p>
<p>2.  The training period for trainees is stipulated to be three years. After graduation, they must serve in the factory for two years. The factory is not responsible for any loss, natural disasters, or man-made disasters.</p>
<p>3.  Within the above-mentioned period, trainees shall not enroll in school or change careers, otherwise, they shall compensate the factory for tuition fees of one thousand yuan in national currency, and the guarantor shall be responsible for this.</p>
<p>4.  Trainees who pass the examination by the general manager at the time of graduation will be given a certificate and promoted to staff members. Those who fail will have their term extended or be dismissed altogether.</p>
<p>5.  Trainees are not allowed to privately hoard money. All funds due to them from the factory shall be deposited in a savings account. If they need items, they may apply to the general affairs officer to handle them. (Omission)</p>
<p>Here, we have no freedom to study on our own in our spare time, we have no freedom to use our own wages; and most importantly, we must unconditionally sign a five-year contract of servitude. …</p>
<p>Sir! Please think about it, what kind of life should we live under such conditions?</p>
<p>But, likewise, for the sake of life, for the sake of obtaining the minimum amount of food, we were prepared to accept it: But when we went to ask our guarantors to provide a guarantee, their replies were all: "Yes, you can, as long as you give me one thousand yuan, I will guarantee you." Sir! Where do the workers get one thousand yuan? We were thwarted. When we were thwarted everywhere, the factory not only did not understand, but also set a deadline to submit it by the end of this month, otherwise, we would be fired. This really made us "have no way to go to heaven and no door to enter the earth."</p>
<p>Sir, we want to live, we are willing to work. In order to obtain the minimum amount of living materials, we are even prepared to sacrifice our entire happiness, but now everything is completely over. The boss's iron wrist is holding our sixty lives tightly. We do not have one thousand yuan, and we are watching unemployment and displacement right in front of us. What lies before us is the road to death.</p>
<p>But we want to live, we want to live. … With the greatest hope, we write to you, sir, asking you to publish our letter and appeal to society on our behalf, asking righteous people to lend us a helping hand. …</p>
<p>Respectfully wishing you good health!</p>

<p>(9) A Farmer from an Ancient Marsh</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, it was the cold winter season again. This evening, Xiao Meibao, as usual, took out the photo album left by Xiangqi, looked through it again, and leaned on the warm kang, chatting with Begonia about her mother, long mother, and short mother.</p>
<p>"Didn't I tell you just now that Mother is even taller than Da Jiazi!?" Today, Begonia was really troubled. After Xiao Meibao had repeatedly asked him the same question three or four times, the tone of his answer was unknowingly much harsher than usual.</p>
<p>Three days ago, he heard this news:</p>
<p>"The situation in Beijing has changed drastically. The Revolutionary Army has been attacking from the south since the end of last month. The five-colored flag has also been abolished, and hanging it again will result in being shot. Male and female revolutionaries are everywhere. The officials who used to be in office have all been kicked out. Several banks have also collapsed. Rich people have to face lawsuits. Each farmer cannot have more than ten mu of land. Any more than that will result in being dragged to stand in a wooden cage…"</p>
<p>This was said by a Shandong man who was accustomed to selling large silks in the countryside. Judging from Begonia's knowledge, most of it was of course laughable rumors. However, the overall situation had changed, which could definitely not be fabricated by a broker.</p>
<p>"Several banks have also collapsed…"</p>
<p>This sentence made Begonia feel the most uneasy.</p>
<p>And today, the quick letter he received from Zhao Si indeed confirmed what the Shandong man said. He said that the Eastern Province Colonial Bank had collapsed following the retreat of the × army, and the Fuhua Bank was also showing very unstable news due to the downfall of ××× and ×××. These two were precisely where Begonia had stored his only savings! Therefore, according to Zhao Si's meaning, he himself should go there immediately to avoid total annihilation. (131)</p>

<p>— Qinghui</p>
<p>Running a Side Business</p>
<p>Hollywood Chinese photographer Huang Zongzhan, in addition to working on the photography set, has actually opened a restaurant in the bustling downtown area of Hollywood, called Qing Howe Cafe. Many movie stars attended the opening day. John Garfield and James Stewart were the two most enthusiastic. Everyone personally helped to pick dishes and move rice, and each wore a Chinese-style melon-skin hat, expressing admiration for the great spirit of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>International Family</p>
<p>The family of comedian Mischa Auer can simply be called an international building, because the people living in it include seven nationalities. He himself is Russian, his wife is British, their servant is German, the children's nanny is Finnish, the cook is French, the gardener is Japanese, and the ranch manager is Swedish. Therefore, he can speak the languages of these seven countries.</p>
<p>Self-Recommendation</p>
<p>In the past, it was often very difficult for producers to ask a star to take on a certain role; but now all these difficulties have been overcome. Many stars are practicing self-recommendation. For example, Joan Crawford, when she read the script for "The Women," asked to play the harlot Crystal. Also, the role of Susan in "Reunion in France" was also obtained at her request, and both achieved great success. Also, Hedy Lamarr's co-starring with James Stewart in "Come Live with Me" was also successful due to Hedy's self-recommendation.</p>
<p>Baby Elephant Dies</p>
<p>MGM has a baby elephant star whose name is Bady Bea. She was only three years old and made a brief appearance in "Tarzan Finds a Son." She recently died suddenly. However, the company is eager to film a new Tarzan film, so it urged the zoo director Imerson to find a replacement, but he has not yet found one.</p>
<p>New Work Renamed</p>
<p>Shirley Temple has joined MGM, and her first work was originally scheduled to co-star with Miguel Toronchikara in "Panama Hattie." But according to MGM's latest confirmed news, it has been changed and will co-star with Huarez Piel in "Lazy Bone."</p>

<p>Martial artist Zha Ruilong has progressive ideas, is enthusiastic about sports, and especially loves art. He has led art troupes on tours to various ports in Southeast Asia, where he was well-received. The overseas Chinese giant Wang Chaozhuan in the Philippines believes that Mr. Zha has been back in China for several years, and the overseas Chinese and local people miss his demeanor and hope that he will travel south again. He has sent repeated telegrams inviting him. Mr. Zha cannot refuse the sentiment, and since it is this time, rather than living in isolation on the island, he would rather avoid the noise overseas. He has decided to lead the Guanghua Art Troupe (formerly the Guoguang Troupe led by Mr. Zha) to perform in Cebu, Iran, and other places in the Philippines. He is currently busy preparing, and will set off as soon as he is ready. It is heard that the Guanghua organization includes techniques, singing, dancing, magic, etc.? Among them, Zhang Suzhen, Yin Jin, and Chen Peiyu's singing and dancing, Zhu Enrong, Zhu Yulan, and Zhu Wangzhen's techniques, and Li Menghuan and Huang Yushu's magic are all said to be superb. With such a strong lineup, led by Mr. Zha to perform, it will surely cause a sensation everywhere and return with honor.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Ten: Gongsun's Sword Qi First Appears, Part One</p>
<p>Liu Yining repeatedly declined and deferred, but could not refuse, so he had no choice but to, along with Wang Yongtai, Xu Jing, and others, partake in the sumptuous banquet hosted by Zhou Yuji within the yamen. Several subordinate generals, Zhang Lie, Fan Cheng, and others, accompanied them at the feast. Cups were raised and exchanged, and host and guests alike were filled with joy until dusk before the banquet dispersed. Xu Jing and Liu Yining, along with Wang Yongtai, thanked Zhou Yuji and departed. Having left the yamen gate, Liu Yining still intended to return to the mountain. Wang Yongtai said, "It is already late. Why bother returning at night? Last night, the family elder of Liu was not informed clearly. I presume arrangements have been made today. Please come to my humble abode to rest for the night, and return to your residence tomorrow." Liu Yining initially declined, but after Xu Jing insisted on him staying, he accompanied Xu Jing to Wang's residence. Wang Yongtai had already instructed servants to clean the guest room where Xu Jing had stayed previously, preparing it for the two of them to lodge. When Liu Yining initially heard that he was to share a room with Xu Jing, he seemed displeased. He said that he had a peculiar habit of always sleeping alone and could not share a bed with others. Xu Jing then spoke to Wang Yongtai, who arranged for an additional bed, to which Liu Yining reluctantly agreed. As night deepened, Xu Jing, having been sleepless the previous night and having drunk quite a bit of wine today, felt very tired and yawned repeatedly. He hung his sword on the wall and urged Liu Yining to rest. Liu Yining sat quietly, backlit by the lamp, his head lowered, not speaking. Xu Jing said, "Today's banquet was most enjoyable. General Zhou treats people with great sincerity, which is why his soldiers are willing to risk their lives. If the rebel Chuang were to attack Daizhou, it certainly would not be easy for him compared to other places. Tonight, I am weary and wish to sleep. Dear brother, please rest early." Liu Yining said, "Brother Jing, please sleep first. I still wish to sit quietly for a while before retiring." Xu Jing did not understand what Liu Yining meant. Thinking that this was his nature, and feeling very tired himself, he undressed and went to sleep. When he woke up the next day, he saw Liu Yining lying on the other bed, facing the wall, wrapped in a thin blanket, still sleeping soundly. He thought to himself that the weather was very hot, yet he was still covering himself with a blanket, truly unafraid of the heat. He got up and dressed, quietly walking to Liu Yining's bed. He saw his eyes slightly closed, his cheeks slightly red, and a very white and delicate arm exposed outside the blanket. The sleeping posture looked just like a woman, and his heart couldn't help but stir. Not daring to disturb him, he walked out to the courtyard to take a stroll and breathe some fresh air. When he returned to the room, Liu Yining was getting up. Seeing Xu Jing, he hastily put on his outer robe and said with a smile, "Brother Jing, you are up early. I overslept." Having spoken, he slipped on his shoes and went outside to relieve himself. (88)</p>
