<h3>二屆國民參政會議蔣委員長演詞　爭取最後勝利完成安全國防</h3>
<p>重慶　蔣委員長於第二屆國防參政會第一次大會開會日（二日）致詞、原詞云、各位參政員先生、今天第二屆國民參政會首次集會、本人代表國防最高委員會出席、對各位參政員先生表示熱烈的歡迎、當此艱苦作戰進入了第五年、以我們全民族正在集中全力、以作生存競爭的時候、我們全民族的賢俊共謀國是由各省淪陷區來會的各位、跋涉險阻、不避艱難、這種共赴國難、同舟共濟的精神、實在是我們民族奮鬥史上一件最可寶貴而最光榮的紀念、回想第一屆參政會成立、於作戰第一週年紀念日、這三年以來、經過五次的集會、匡助政府、執行國策、對於抗建、貢獻良多、此種一貫的精誠與雄偉的力量、不僅舉世屬目、也使全國軍民都為感奮、現在世界大局、更見緊張、我國作戰的形勢、也更見重要、因此這一屆參政會的使命、不僅在承繼前屆光榮的成績、還要適應我們抗建新形勢的需要、而作更進一步的發揚、全國軍民和政府所期望於各位先生者、也因之而更重且大了、今天本人先要將參政會召集以來政府施政的方針、以及中日雙方的形勢、作一個簡單的報告、並趁此機會、陳述個人對於國事前途的信念、自從中國國民黨臨時全國代表大會決議了抗建綱領以後、二十七年七月第一屆參政會全體一致決議擁護、於是這個綱領、就成為我們全國軍民所共矢遵循的信條、也成為戰時政府施政的根本方針、參政會每次開會、都根據這個綱領、提出許多重要的議案、三年以來、政府的工作、可說是完全依據</p>
<p>抗建綱領　並力求符合參政會的決議、詳細經過、各院部會均有報告、自上次閉幕以後的情形、將留待各主管部門詳細報告、概括說起來、政府一切處斷的主旨、在求作戰力量的增長、與建國規模的確立、對於建國的初步工作、主要在造成法治、準備憲治、推進縣以下的地方自治、以完成政治建設、同時更加强生產、發展交通、改善民生、實施經濟管制、以厲行經濟建設、因為種種事實的限制以及戰事形勢之推移、有許多尙未十二分的成效、這在政府方面、今後當努力推進、深望責會盡力協助、期能澈底完成、回溯這兩年多以來、中日形勢演變、可說完全與我國決定作戰國策之初預期的</p>
<p>完全相符、自從作戰轉入了第二期、日人在軍事上、逐漸處於膠着以來、日人雖在桂南和襄西盲目前進、但桂南之日軍到了去秋、終於潰退、襄西之日軍、也陷於進退維谷的窘境、總觀戰事全局、日人業已師老兵疲、而我們戰鬥力量與攻擊精神、方興未艾、日人的軍事、到天今已深陷泥淖、可說日人已自知失敗了、在外交方面、日人因為自知軍事上完全失敗、無法挽救、於是只好投機取巧、妄想在外交上</p>
<p>尋求出路、其對東亞有關各國、時而利誘、時而威脅、但是到了今日、各友邦不特明白認識、對日本決無妥協的餘地、而對於我們中國之必勝、更有深切的信心、各友邦不獨一致拒絕日人的誘脅、並且一致繼續增加對我的援助、所有在太平洋上利害有關的國家、都看透了日本無止境的野心、採取堅決的步驟、太平洋的大局、日見明朗、還是日人內心最大的恐慌、也是世界局勢澈底澄清的徵兆、在政治方面、日人這幾年多來、不斷製造和平謠言、以圖搖撼我戰鬥的意志、動搖我政府的</p>
<p>基本國策、不久以前、又將「汪日密約」正式暴露於世界、但是我們全國一致的作戰、愈戰愈堅强、日人用盡任何計謀、發動了種種謠言攻勢、我們軍民始終是屹然不搖、世界各國反因此而更加認識日本的野心、這由於我們立塲的正大、和意志的堅決、所以在初期、我們是以孤軍奮鬥、來遏制日本、而到了今日、我們的作戰、已形成了太平洋各國共同制裁日本的中心力量、而再從日本內部來說、日本因為他政治破產、來一個「政治新體制」、又因為他經濟破產、來一個什麽經濟新體制、但這種彌縫破綻、竭澤而漁的辦法、幷不能緩和日本崩潰的危機、也幷不能過到他</p>
<p>茍延殘喘的目的、檢討這兩年多以來的經過、我們終於打破最後艱危的環境、樹立了勝利的基礎、這決不是那一部份少數努力所能造成、這完全是我們全國軍民共同一致忍痛刻苦、誓死奮鬥的功績、這一種功績的造成、有多少先烈的鮮血、有多少忠勇的犧牲、有多少可歌可泣的史實、更有無數無名英雄志士、埋頭苦幹的實際貢獻、本人身為統帥、只有十分感奮、期報我全國同胞於萬一、現在要請各位注意的、日人的失敗、是已經決定的了、一般的形勢、於我國作戰十分有利、但我們則不能不作戰最艱苦的打算、最險惡的準備、我們不獨要在</p>
<p>勝利屆近之時更加戒慎、更加奮鬥、而且要對當前世界大局有新的認識、我個人對當前局勢的觀察、對國事前途的信念、歐戰爆發以後、人類的戰禍、有日益擴大的危機、在歐戰過程之中、世界戰術及武器的進步、以及許多小國大國的相繼淪亡、致使全世界人類、不能不動魄驚心、尤其使每一國家不能不澈底覺悟、若不急起直追、作生存競爭、就沒有獨立自由的餘地、這一個民族鬥爭思想的深刻廣泛、目前不過在開始時期、我們深信世界一般的歸趨、必符合於我民族傳統的信念、必有利於我國的抗建、然而我們必須認識一個國家如果沒有</p>
<p>充分自衛的決心和實力、決不能生存於這鬥爭的世界、在東亞方面、日人因侵華失敗、天大想完成他侵略的迷夢、着着南進、不過是一種手段、而滅華實在是他的目標、而且在他南進之初、必定對我們有一個最後的攻勢、所以侵華與南進、是一件事、不是兩件事、日人所謂「大東亞新秩序」、和「大東亞共榮圈」、更是對於我國和整個東亞莫大的侮辱、為什麽在「東亞新秩序」上要加一個「大」字、其義無非是要侵奪廣大之南洋資源·領土、增强其侵略力量、澈底封鎖中國、削弱我國作戰力量、以便最後實現他獨霸太平洋、與滅亡中國的迷夢、各位知道、南洋不獨是我們一百二十餘萬僑胞</p>
<p>居住生息的第二祖國、也是我們民族安危存亡之所繁、日人侵略南洋、無疑是中國生存、及國防安全之最大威脅、我們要認清日人雖已失敗、毫無悔禍之心、且因歐戰發生、更增貪慾、更妄想投機、以求一逞、我們不獨要堅決作戰到底、來維護我國家的獨立生存、而且必須以實力打破日閥對世界對東亞變局、尤其是中日雙方勝敗存亡之最後的一個階段、（二日電未完）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>德軍入保</h3>
<p>歐洲局勢次一幕的劇烈演變，行將揭開，現在是其前夕。這前夕之前的最近兩星期間，保加利亞儼然主角，他於三月十七日與土耳其簽訂了互不侵犯條的，又於本月一日加入了德義日的三國軸心，似是多角外交的成功；但是跟着發展的事實反證了他並非主角，是被搬演的傀儡，是被徵用的舞臺。保國在一九零八年纔得宣告獨立，翌年纔得國際承認，立國蓋僅三十三年；本月二日，保國朝野方事預祝其次日的獨立紀念，但因先一日參加軸心之結果，德國軍隊即以盟主的姿態，保護保國俾免英國進攻為理由，先得保國政府同意為根據，浩浩蕩蕩，長驅而入保境。昨日電訉，德國陸空兩軍入保總數，估計既達五十萬人，立即佔領了保國的全部。據德方宣稱，德軍入保時，人民歡呼迎之云；而保國首相亦向國會演說謂：保國雖允德軍入境，但仍將履行條約義務，決不變更和平政策，決不作何攻擊，亦不威脅他國利益；德軍在保時期有限，以維持和平秩序為目的，并當玫慮保國對鄰國的條的義務，不使保國作何抵觸此項義務的行為」，國會予以多數可決。這是舞台上極簡短的一個塲面，沒有砲聲，沒有火光，沒有血色，却亦得視為倒嚥血淚而强顏歡笑的獨幕悲劇。</p>
<p>歐局劇變雖將揭開，在這前夕還難斷言希特勒氏究將怎樣導演次一幕。以意度之跟着收服保加利亞之後，再收服南斯拉夫；然後對希臘先來一套先禮後兵，或竟省略了這一套，即在這一方面發動大規模的血戰，以冀挫敗英希，亟謀救活他的夥計義大利，完成他久已宣揚的春季攻勢；這是最可想像的趨勢，但亦祗是可能的動嚮之一，未可斷言其爲盡然而必然，其間惟有南斯拉夫，及今既陷大包圍之中，可謂業已註定了這樣命運，步武保國後塵，或且每况愈下。</p>
<p>希特勒氏主動了一切，然豈能主宰一切！倘若主宰由彼，則倫敦白銀漢宮去秋便豎了　字旗幟，非洲去冬便建了羅馬帝國。就他所主動的來說，却亦不能不佩服他思慮周密，手脚乾脆。從德軍的開入保國，可知土保簽訂互不侵犯條約是他在外交上甚關重要的預先布置，所以避免在脅誘保國參加軸心與保國容忍德軍入境的時候，刺激了土耳其，逼使土國與英國駢肩作戰；從德軍開入保國的多且速，可知前此控制羅馬尼亞的不盡為了羅國油鑛而其目標甚遠，故昨傳羅國境內德軍祇剩六千人了。證以上文在舉保國首相所演說的維持和平政策與履行義務，一面表示這次演變的性質，雖許德軍假道，然非追隨德國參戰，這正是符合納綷哲學中的『善意中立』；一面以條約義務穩住了土耳其，使之勿因他種義務而對於入保的德軍形成對立，甚或交戰。這些皆自皮相得之。很可能的背後別有他種默契。蓋德國在巴爾幹方面的猛進，根本上沒有理由與方法可使蘇聯與土耳其漠然無動於中而無所憂慮疑危；然羅國德軍僅剩六千豈不可視為德蘇之間默契了，德國決不由羅國而威脅及於蘇聯所掌握的多腦河下游，保相所保證的德軍在保時期有限之說豈不可視為德土之間默契了德國決不由保國而威脅及於土國所掌握的韃靼尼爾海峽。蘇聯與土耳其最所關切者，即在多腦下游與韃靼海峽，此而始終在掌握之中，也就屏蔽了整個黑海的安全。</p>
<p>凡上所陳，皆是希特勒氏所主動。推其趨歸，還要看另一方面的英國，怎樣鬬法？其間的過去未來，皆難嘹然；一如英國外相艾登氏與參謀總長狄爾將軍，最近聘問土耳其，當然負有重大使命，現在業已欣欣然的離開土國了，究竟有何切實的成就，即英土之間究能如何合作？一如英希與德義瞬即發生一塲近乎決定性質的大戰，得失勝負究將何似？這些俱屬無可懸斷，尤不可知者，英國與蘇聯之間，滲透了土耳其的利害關係，現在是何悲歡離合相？就一般情理推測，蘇聯與德國即使有何默契，德土間或有直接默契，或有蘇聯介在其間的間接默契，至多相忍於暫時；弄兵如弄火，自有不能控制火燄而蔓延的一日；况蘇德兩國間的厚薄友敵，必然與德國聲勢成反此例；故一切劇變，皆在正來！</p>
<h3>德春季攻勢前奏　對保國完成控制　德軍先鋒隊逼近希臘　保政府決暫對鎖邊界</h3>
<p>柏林　德軍司令部昨夜發表公報、略稱、德軍司令部已獲悉英國在東南歐之企圖、德軍已採取預防措置、於獲得保國政府之許可後、開入保國、德軍為保國民衆所熱列歡迎、（三日海軍社急電）</p>
<p>柏林　消　靈通方向稱、德軍入保、係往保護保加利亞之利益及打擊英國在該處展開戰爭之陰示、政界稱、保國之加人軸心、為德國之軍事勝利、而此後加入者、尙有他國、其意蓋指南斯拉夫也（三日合衆社電）</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談　（卅）（八）　春季攻勢前夕　德國實力的透視</h3>
<p>希特勒日前曾在團社黨成立二十一週年紀念會演說，中有一語云：「我覺得現在比以前更為健旺，因為春天將到，這又是較量我們實力的時候了」。然則德國的實力到了此時究竟强弱到怎麼程度？茲將美國Christian　Science　Monitor駐柏林訪員的報吿，譯錄如下：</p>
<p>德國在歐陸獲得最偉大的軍事勝利之後，却像希臘神話中的湯泰勒斯王一般，雖已在沙塲上每戰皆捷，却仍須準備作最大的努力，以獲取那尙在搖曳不定，可望而不可即的勝利之果。</p>
<p>曠觀歷史，像德軍作戰這樣的勢如破竹，確為古今所罕見，然像德國這樣一再在幻想瀕於實現之際，勝利仍屬虛無縹渺，也是歷來所少有的呀！</p>
<p>德國的軍事當局和備受困苦而馴伏不動的民衆，却並不因為對於最後勝利發生疑惑，而使他們的信念稍起動搖。德國具有歷史上訓練最精的軍隊，從米被人擊敗過，即在最近一年來驚人的戰役中，也從米被人阻檔過。可是它的最後勝利，依然留下一些誘惑，似乎常會在最後一剎那間被奪，看去似乎到手在即，終如水月鏡花一樣的空幻。</p>
<p>自入新春，德軍又在移動了，他們重又企圖以疾風掃葉之勢，獲取德國與德國人民八年來節衣縮食，出力出汗所期望得着的賞賜。他們對於這個賞賜，不是輕容易可以被奪去的。他們的進攻力量，至少在陸空兩方面已較前更為强大了。他們在去年春季進攻法國的武器，已受過經騐和勝利的磨礪，外加新兵的入伍，和六七個月軍火工業的日夜趕造而益增其分量了。</p>
<p>這一大兵團無論向何處推進，皆具有可怕的力量，而且龐大異常，可於　時在幾方面進攻。它無疑地布置在歐洲西海岸，可用以攻擊實力雄厚的英國。它顯然還有更大的兵力，正在向地中海方面英國屬地移動着。此外它還有不少軍隊嚴陣以待，保障着德蘇友好條的安全。軍事上任何種可能性皆在德軍最高當局神計妙算之中。</p>
<p>在此種種可能之中，德國的軍略家，已選擇他們所認為最適宜於擊破英國抵抗力而獲得最後勝利的地方，使國社黨可以統制歐菲兩洲，且能保持古　馬帝國以來無與倫比的世界覇權。</p>
<p>然而一九四〇年縱然已使古日耳曼的征服夢近於實現之境，同時亦已發見他們失敗時所必須遭受的懲罰了。當去年德國攻勢發動以前，歐洲其他各國的內部，莫不有被其歐洲新秩序觀念所强烈吸引的分子。即在德國軍隊侵入各該國以後，仍有接受征服，與德合作的强烈運動存在。然而數月以來，此種忍受已一變而為猜疑，恐懼，反抗和仇峎了。</p>
<p>隨着戰勝軍隊的行進，所經之處，人和觀念都起了一種劇變，實際已播下怨忿的種子了。</p>
<p>像德國今日這樣的舉目無親，殆為從來所未有。希望它最後一敗塗地的情緒已由受它控制的區域而瀰漫及於全世界。假使它的軍隊，一旦逡巡退却，德國即將收獲自己所種下的惡果。德國軍隊征略的區域愈　，戰勝的需要亦隨之增加。德國因為知道這一點，所以這得祇有再向前進，使國內的穩健分子噤若寒蟬，而野心勃勃漫無止境者則愈增其發言權</p>
<p>一年以來，德國因軍事勝利的迅速，所以軍備方面並未吿竭。糧食和原料的消耗大部份有戰利品可以補償。德國人民今日所吃的食物，幾與去冬一般，德國當局曾說，假使果有嚴重飢饉的時候，最先遭難的決不會是德國人。可是德國內部的情形已發生了不少變動，晤示戰爭若無限期延長，則必不免有飢饉之憂。</p>
<p>德國　口授糧制常在擴大範圍，包括更多的物品。家庭用品，或為日常生活所必需，或為防止通貨膨脹而購備的，已益見减少。物價統制並未能防止價格的上漲，衣着費幾已漲起百分之百。主要食物的價格和數量，仍與以前的略相同，然如硬殼果，葡萄乾，巧克力和水果等額外食品，則均異常缺乏。平均分配食物，原是計口授糧最合理的目標，現已漸為各種　習慣所排斥了。</p>
<p>德國國內已有黑市塲存在。咖啡的三十馬克一磅，茶葉的四五十馬克一磅，若能知道牠出售的所在，儘可不難購到。談及家庭給養問題，時　可以聽到「聯絡」兩字。還有一個普通名詞，便是「在櫃檯底下」，凡與商店素有往來的人，都可暗中授受，以得到額外的美味。</p>
<p>以上種種，並沒有指示德國已感到眞正的缺乏。街上行人看去依然康健，未顯出營養不足之狀。可是這些小事巳足使有識者想到二三年後，情形將有不同。生活程度的降落是逐漸的，而不是驟然的，一個月一個月的過去，當然不容易看出，可是終年都在下降呀！</p>
<p>一年以來，德國的民氣維持得很高，實際現在的民氣比較去年此時還要高些。</p>
<p>當一九三九年末，除了波蘭方面軍事勝利之外，別無共代表現，可使德國人民信仰他們軍隊力量的優越。自從不費吹灰之力戰勝法國以後，在戰事初起時幾個月內的種種憂疑，已一掃而空。他們有此勝利的紀錄，已大大的足以安慰人心。可是隨這民氣問題而發生的便是萬一戰事失敗則將如何，這種恐懼心理亦已在潛滋暗長了。</p>
<p>因懼人仇恨的結果，大多　德國人，不論他們對於國社主義的感情如何，莫不擁護勝利主義。祇要他們能預看到勝利，便可望他們始終擁護戰爭。惟有破壞他們勝利信念纔會嚴重影響到德國的民氣。</p>
<p>可是在另一方面說起來，假使他們所期望的最後勝利，受到嚴重打擊，則其反應的重大已可不難想見。民氣建築在期望勝利和恐懼失敗的聯合基礎上面，而不在基本信仰主義的正當上面，其缺乏持久的熱忱也已顯然可見。</p>
<p>美國威脅的逐漸呈露，已漸使德國人民為之不安。這是逼得他們的軍事方針趨向於新的努力，以求早獲幻想中的勝利的另一因素。但因新聞統制之故，德國民衆，對於此種威脅，尙祇有一種糢糊的影像，而未能詳悉美國方面的趨勢。一班普通人目僅知道美國的援英，乃以英國金錢所　償付者為限。他們依然相信美國完全是抱着金錢主義。</p>
<p>足與德國民氣以是嚴重打擊的，乃是美國的援英作戰，並不僅為利益着想。這種眞相</p>

<h3>利空消息中斷　金價直上</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤、多頭較為活躍、蓋市面利空消息中斷、人心膠着、一般經營者索心趨向買進、而大衆跟風購進、除晨開後稍回外、以後步高至六千三百元、中以祥和綿同康永·大豐等買進最夥、散戶及浮多間有獲利了結、故漲勢尙緩、至外滙報緊、亦是鼓勵買者之主耍因素也、晚收價為六千二百九十六元、比上週末收市軋大一百三十三元、收後的六千三百〇二元、父現貨行市仍堅、上午會做開比期交大五百八十五元、午後為五百五十元、飾金午後較高十元、達七百元、海關金等平、</p>
<p>軋升一百卅餘元</p>
<p>晨初以人心俱堅、且上週末收後、塲外亦昂、開盤賣戶揑持、遂吿六千二百十元、未幾大豐一大兩戶力求、漲至六千二百三十元、但恒記·成記乘高售出大豐·一大亦相繼回吐、致退入六千二百元關內、吿六千一百八十元、惟因同康永·祥和·祥興永買興頗濃、且外滙亦稍報軟、潛勢向上、盤旋至六千二百十八元、迨近午刻、散戶拉力亦猛、雖遇浮戶了結、收盤則穩吿六千三百十五元、後市開盤即漲、為六千二百三十元、稍頃曾小五元、至六千二百二十五元、然恒記·合盛·祥和·成記等聯袂搜購、再聞外匯緊勢轉俏、激動買風、先升達六千二百九十元、斯時散戶及義豐肯吐、回落至六千二百六十元、終以外滙軟化、而德大·一大等均進、又抬高至六千三百元、延至晚收、尙有六千二百九十六元、收後塲外已出六千三百元外、的六千三百〇二元、比上週末收軋升一百三十三元、全日上落一百二十元、現金號之本牌金售出價、較烚赤（現貨）高十餘元、收進比售出低三十元、現標金無市、</p>

<h3>糧食　期現米糧　竟爾絕跡</h3>
<p>洋米市自週前已呈完全絕跡之後、昨則開市更甚於昔、不獨現貨未出樣、及期貨亦乏開出、市上所有出售者僅有香港糯一項、然糯米存底不充、致使在各方搜求之下、市價頓時飛漲二三元之巨、香港特別團粒開九十三元、次之長粒九十元、此種情形、誠難言喩焉</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、際此洋米不良狀態中、人心亦被帶高、故無論厚薄兩粳、價續增元砠、開常幫原白粳百十叫元、斛見百十一元、崑山原白粳白十二元、斛見百零八九元、靑角斛見薄稻特自百零五元、次至百零三元半、</p>

<p>小麥市况、頗為暗挺、蓋以內地供源枯竭、洋麥新到一船尙在起卸、且有受潮之貨、在粉價漲勢中、執貨者更為報俏、日廠門市雖願放價、亦無現貨收取、市面吏呈僵局、</p>
<h3>西貢米之銷塲</h3>
<p>— 鶴</p>
<p>日本缺米，盡人皆知，今所賴以彌補者，除向中國產區搜刮外，西貢亦為其供給巨區，查一九三九至一九四〇年度，日本之產米量已大形短缺，而一九四〇至一九四一年度之產量，復减百分之十五，本年度日本米糧不足之數，約為一百五十萬噸，越南遂被迫供給大宗米糧，而以日本過剩之織品相交換，即二月份，日本派赴西貢運送米糧之專輪，不下七艘之多。</p>
<p>越南米糧之出口量，佔總輸出貨百分之四十五，其每年價額的為四千一百萬美元，以各方需要之殷，一九三九年之出口量，共為一百六十九萬二千噸，去年的增百分之十五，自法國失敗後，歐洲不復得越南米粗之供給，起而代之者除中國外（尤其為上海），又有印度斐利濱及英屬馬來亞荷屬東印度，蓋各國政府鑒於戰機急迫，多預購大宗米糧，以備萬一也。</p>
<p>日本在一九三八年自西貢輸人之米糧絕少，迨一九三九及一九四〇年其數大增，據日方估計，本年越　米糧之輸出額的為一百五十萬噸，就中七十萬噸將輸入日本，餘則輸入印度馬來亞荷屬東印度及中國，一九三九年越南輸入上海之米共二萬一千五百噸，去年增至二十六萬九千噸，今年輸入之數，的與去年相埒，本年一月份上海輸入之米超過五萬噸，其由西貢輸入者的佔五分之四，茲將本年一月份與上年前年同期上海輸入米糧之概况，列表比較如左。</p>

<p>雙馬晨開、市狀穩靜、首盤價為一千三百六十五元、此盤一開、買者甚形活躍、漸漸而上升至一千三百九十二元、旋因獲利者吐出、形態稍疲、跌至一千三百七十七元、但收盤略振、為一千三百八十元、查半日間成交統計七千三百八十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量列左、</p>

<h3>證劵　公債盤旋作勢</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日市况極為淸閒而安定、市價祇在二三角間盤旋、信孚吃進仍未停止、但因賣方已稀、而買進亦少、各方皆存觀望、市價乃異常沉悶、上午順昌及信孚買進、信誠及潤德賣出、各方大多數作壁上觀、午前交易不過一二十萬而已、市價祇五分一角上落、午後信孚仍有買進、仁豐忽有二三十萬進胃、但聯和久豐又不斷供給、市價續疲五分一角、結果丁種及九六仍未做開、戊種雖無上落、餘小一角至三角、成交不過七十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>經濟叢譚　金剛石流入中國之檢討</h3>
<p>— 馮柳堂</p>
<p>自金剛石一文刋布後，接有張靜樂君（一月九日）來函，略謂</p>
<p>「憶二十九年春，鄙人鑒於金剛石販賣業者，所用權量器具，俱係舶來品，思仿製數種，藉以少塞漏巵，爰製鑽石量鉗及天平二種，並編製鑽石衡量對照表一書，附有金剛石識小錄，以增讀者興趣，歡迎指正補充。不意事隔經年，業此者並無隻字敎我，要亦識短文拙，未克引玉所致耳！今讀宏文，獲益匪淺。惟鄙人對於金剛石於何朝何年何人最先輸入中國，及Carat（不甚廣用之世界公制）於何年及何種方式改為二〇〇公絲二點，頗欲求知，用特冒昧求敎，並附鑽石衡量對照表一本，希指正」云云。</p>
<p>除對於張君惠賜鴻著表示謝忱外。最近就讀史所得，發見張君第一問題中所欲問之一點，因趁今日休沐有暇，以答張君，並為讀者吿：</p>
<p>金剛鑽之一名詞，見於明史，前文已言之矣。至何時何人輸入中國，此則在中國史書及筆記中所不易求到；蓋中國文人於詩詞文章，是其拿手慣技；而稍帶一些格物功夫的東西，以為工商來藝，雕蟲小技，不値一顧，遑論記述。今經濟叢談之作，偏欲從此等處下功夫，故往往勞費多而成效寡，一文之成，寫來不甚費力，然平時所費功夫，却也不少，故於事物之起始，惟有就字句中加以推論之一法，此亦無辦法中之辦法也。</p>
<p>中國與外國通，六朝之後漸興，然大都取自陸道，海道雖　而未盛，即蒙古之進攻歐亞，亦從陸行。航行之利，至明成祖時鄭和七次下南洋而始著。自永樂三年（西曆一四〇五年）初次放洋，終於宣德五年（西曆一四三〇年），凡使三十餘國，所取無名寳物不可以數計。此「無名寳物」之寥寥四字中，正不知將南洋西歐物品流人中華者包括多少在內。不但如此，即其時熱帶動物以貢品獻納明廷者，如榜葛刺屢進麒麟，魯迷等國進獅子犀牛，不一見。麒麟，照明史所記，固即今非洲所產之長頸鹿Giraffa也，獅犀更無論已！至明正德時葡萄牙人已來廣東，當時西洋物品見之於詩詞中者，如吳寬謝西域眼鏡詩，記者於眼鏡考中，嘗致疑於「西域」二字之範圍，今亦另得有證據，足微西域固有眼鏡流入，不定來自滿刺加也。</p>
<p>至於珠玉寳石之自外國流入中國，最盛之時期，則為明世宗時代。（嘉靖元年—叫十五年，西曆一五二二年—一五六六年）明世宗中葉以後，頗喜方士術，營建齋醮，採木，採杳，採珠玉寳石，吏民奔走不暇。用黃白蠟至三十餘萬斤，沉香降香海漆諸香至十餘萬斤，又分道購　涎香，十餘年未獲，因之請海舶入澳，為葡萄牙占踞澳門之始。又用紅黃玉製方澤朝　壇爵，購之陜西邊境不得（即向西域商人買），遣使至吐魯蕃西南二千里之阿丹求之。用太倉之銀，　人承運，辦金寳珍珠。於是貓兒庫睛，祖母碌石，緣撒索尼石，紅刺石，北河洗石，甘黃玉，無所不購。繆宗承之，購珠寳益所不購。繆宗承之，購珠寳益急。神宗黷　，珠寳價增舊二十倍，順天府尹以大珠鴉靑購貿不如旨，鐫級，可見明帝搜求珠寳之切，而外國珠寳流入必多也。</p>
<p>由是可知世宗中葉，已有金剛鑽輸入，而輸入之居間者，無疑之為葡萄牙人，蓋葡人當時已入居澳門矣。</p>
<p>至於每克拉之重量，何時改為二〇〇公絲，此則余與張君在目前，同是知其然而不知其所以然。且待將來發見時，再行介紹於讀者。好在為學無止境，一人之心思才力，不用之於彼，即用之於此。我有所不知，人或有所知，以所知補不知，亦切磋琢磨之道也。</p>
<p>金剛鑽視克拉之大小而計算價格之方法，盛克中君舉疑來詢，但余究非業中人，尙無以答。今乘此機會，以請經營鑽石事業者詳舉見　，自當披露，想亦爲讀者所歡迎，豈僅盛君而已哉</p>

<h3>本市燃料問題　目前尙無虞匱乏　電流供給採取遞减步骤　煤觔來源絡繹並未中斷　本市工業界對此事不過份重視</h3>
<p>上海整個燃料問題、極為各方重視、據查平市存煤數量、的在十五萬噸左右、此數當不能謂少、工部局所組織之硏究電流供給問題委員會、定今日繼續召集會議、討論電流供給問題、並定於明日工部局董事會舉行例會時、提出肆議、據權威力面傳出之消息稱、該會擬提出下列建議、（一）上海電力公司所提出之减少供給電流計劃、應遂步實施、使本市工業、不致因而蒙受不利、同時對於請求者本身、亦不致因而受有損失、（二）工部局應援助上海電力公司、獲得運輸煤斤及油之船隻、同時、此間華商工廠現正設法應付工部局行將核准電力公司减少供給電流計劃後之新局勢、</p>
<p>考量縮短　工作時間昨（三日）晨探悉、上海電力公司僅有三個月煤斤供給之消息傳出後、本市華籍製造商、已考慮將電流供給缺少時、採取之步驟、今市商會旣已停閉、而電流又有短期內减少之可能、故若干工廠現正考量縮短工作時間目下多數華商工廠晝夜開工、共耗上海電力公司所供全部電力之什六〇、</p>
<p>若干工廠　未予重視</p>
<p>又若干華商工廠表示、彼等對於此事、並不過分重視、因若干工廠、因缺乏原料、早已被迫停閉、彼等否認煤斤之存額减少、據稱上月份所進口之煤、較去年同時期為多、此外尙有大批煤斤，在運滬途中、而本市航界人士、亦未奉令停止運輸貨物、故船隻問題、亦非特別嚴重、</p>
<p>煤斤來源　有增無减</p>
<p>日來國外煤斤來源、有增無减、然市塲謠言沸騰、或謂太平洋風雲日緊、煤斤來源、將趨中斷、或謂煤運水脚高漲、成本加重、但　據探悉、定貨運滬、現仍絡繹於途、日昨Mora　輪又由安南裝來鴻基白煤及一號小子計共二千七百噸、業已起卸上棧、該項煤斤、係由義泰興。南洋·兩煤球公司所經理、惟各界渴盼該兩公司將該項煤斤即予脫手、短期間予以供應市塲、</p>
<p>一月運滬　數量可觀</p>
<p>本年一月份運滬煤斤數量、業由江海關絲計竣事、茲探錄如下、共計一一八·三一九公噸、價値九五〇·二四七金單位、合値國幣二·五七二·三一九元、其中以日本為最多、計四五·〇〇九公噸、其次為央屬印度、計二九·一六五公噸、第三為台灣、計一八·三二二公噸、第四為朝鮮、計一四·九四一公噸、第五為安南、計一一，〇〇〇公噸、復出口計二一〇公噸、故一月份以賤煤來源最夥、</p>
<p>機油售罄　新貨未到</p>
<p>昨悉、此間某美商油公司之機器油、已吿用罄、而其他油公司目下所存機油亦微、故上海有機油匱乏之勢、聞上述美商油公司　晨已無機油供給經當顧主、其所舉理由為存貨業已售盡、而新貨非至月底、不致運抵上海其他油公司昨日（三日）尙出售為量有限之機油、但不願談判巨量出售之交易、而僅準備交付小量機油、</p>
<p>汽油存底　尙稱充足</p>
<p>同時、本市若干商行與個人因恐汽油不久亦將缺貨、昨日乃紛紛添購、聞昨晨添購汽油與機油者多屬汽車與卡車出租公司、惟據本市各汽油公司電稱、目下有充量汽油可得、而數月內亦不致缺乏、汽油諒將短缺之說或係希圖囤積汽油居奇牟和之投機者所傳出、</p>
<h3>英大使　今日乘裕生輪抵埠</h3>

<h3>新普育堂　捐款踴躍</h3>
<p>新普育堂昨續承各界熱誠損輸、並收到月捐捐款甚多、彙誌如次、陸　耕一千元、松江無名氏一百元、童君銘五十元、陳海陵二十元、華紳達十二元、鄭懷　五元、陳文醒三元、父月捐捐款計收到義泰興五百元、大隆興三百元、張先生二百元、濟華堂藥房一百元、五洲藥房一百元、煤業慈善會一百元、立記一百兀、呂桂叢五十元、裘景梁五十元、積善堂五十元、（以上均係月捐）讜代該堂孤苦兒童申謝、該堂收捐衣物地點、天主堂、法租界洋涇浜天主堂街，收捐款處、（一）綢業銀行信託　、漢口路四六〇號、（二）華比銀行、外灘沙遜大厦、（三）濟華堂、雲　路四十七號、（四）華美藥房、福州路三五六號、（五）天主堂、法和界　涇浜天主堂街、</p>
<h3>美紅會賑濟米麥　卽將到滬</h3>
<p>美國紅十字會救濟中國災民之第三批米麥、在載運　滬途中、據平明社記者昨向　埠美國紅十字會中國分會訪悉、該會　到美國紅十字會來電報吿、第三批捐助中國災民之米麥數額、計有美麥八萬包、及米糧八千包、已在運滬途中、米糧八千包、係由美郵船批亞士總統號裝運、可於本月八日到埠、美麥八萬包、則裝由初次駛滬之美郵船賽太梯亞號、可於本月九日到埠、該會現正商決此項賑濟米麥之分配辦法、又悉貝克博士、於上月間由渝搭飛機赴港、擘畫救濟事宜、即將飛返重慶、並無夾滬之訊、</p>
<h3>米號業焦慮民食　請求日供萬包　米價暗盤叢生越限愈遠　門銷零售不敷已感恐慌</h3>
<p>上海市米號業同業公會昨致函兩租界當局云、敬啟者、自從米價飛漲、民食受其影響、外洋來源雖暢、存底尙厚、惟去路亦旺、而市塲交易、旬日以來、為謠風所惑、有貨者拔俏不售、演成有市無貨局面、傳聞塲外暗盤叢生、</p>
<p>今日尤甚</p>
<p>越限愈遠、依照所定限價、竟致無貨可購、吾同業米號　銷零售、供應全市民食、隨時購進、以應市需、一旦缺貨應銷、必致引起人民之恐慌、吾同業各米號處此環境之下、欲守限價、則無貨可購、若欲應門銷而越限購進、則犧牲太大、現在各米號</p>
<p>存貨將罄</p>
<p>長此以往、不謀補救、不但民食陷憂、草可解除、即地方治安、亦有莫大關係、為此函達仰祈鈞局俯念民生為重、迅予勸令懷貨者每日供應市塲現米萬包、以應民食需要、而免發生恐慌、是所切禱、</p>
<h3>滬西日哨兵開槍　擊斃小販　被捕者的一百餘人　均被解送虹口監禁</h3>
<p>昨日上午六時許、有江北貧苦男女小販十餘人、由滬西虹橋鎭方面、每人各購得國米數十斤、偷越鐵絲網運入租界、以博繩頭微利、距走至滬西徐家匯火車站東首柿子灣前面鐵絲網口、突被預伏該處之日哨兵瞥見、開槍射擊、當塲擊斃年的三十餘歲之江北小販一名、受傷男女二口、餘各四散逃逸、近來百物昂貴、一般貧民、咸不能維持生活、故滬西漕河涇梅隴虹橋七寳近郊一帶鄕民、成羣結隊、咸至徐家匯購買香烟布匹糖油等日用物品、運銷內地、藉以糊口、但上項物品、均被日方統制、不准運入內地、一般貧苦小販、遂在士山灣附近偷越鐵絲綱、以圖徼倖、近被日方知悉、於前昨二日、被捕者的計有二百餘人之多、均用運貨汽車解送虹口監禁、而以婦孺幼孩居多、</p>
<h3>日如悍然南進　必遭慘酷還擊　英美佈置就緒將及時行動　經濟封鎖與軍事二者並進</h3>
<p>日本續極　動南進後、遠東局勢、日趨惡劣、英美兩國以南洋羣島一帶、傳統之權益優厚、而軍事根據地如新嘉坡·馬尼刺等勢成犄角、自不容日本長驅南進、故亦秣　厲兵、準備還　、幷有聯合實施經濟封鎖、制裁日本之計劃、新聲社記者以英美經濟封鎖之舉、與大局關係、極為密切、乃於昨日走訪本埠某外籍觀察家、詢以英美經濟封鎖可能之發展、與日本之持久力、渠首謂日本經濟實力、外强中乾、設英美開始經濟封鎖、而中國亦能乘機反攻、則日本將於一年內敗北目前英美業匕佈置就緒、日如不顧一切、決　南進、則必遭冷酷還擊、其前途堪慮、可想而知、</p>
<p>全部封鎖　日本貿易</p>
<p>就目前形勢觀之、英美與日之商業關係、有斷絕可能、日木如不停止對華軍事冒險與南　政策、將使華盛頓與之斷絕一切商業往來、英國定亦贊成此項封鎖政策、與美採取一致行動、而英美屬地亦將紛紛響應、最後出於一戰、英美得以迅雷不及掩耳之手段、封鎖第三國與日本之貿易、對日本經濟實為嚴　打擊、雖然日軍部近年來竭力在本國及「滿洲國」儲蓄煤·油·鋼·鐵等軍需材料甚夥、日本經濟不致因英美封鎖而在數月內崩潰、但此舉至少可使日本所儲軍需、日益减少、而至用罄、按服正確估計、日本之儲蓄量、如一且有减無增、可維持目前軍需工業之生產標準九個月至十二個月、換言之、日本經濟崩潰、至多在一年以後、其時軍需原料缺少、使之不能維持、陷於絕望之地位、</p>
<p>大宗原料　依賴英美</p>
<p>中日戰爭三年餘來、日本在貿易上為數極多、所有鐵·鋼·錫錳·鋁·鎢·鎳·橡皮·石油·棉花·羊毛·木質纖維（製紙原料）·皮革·革製品·蔴·蘇打·及化學肥料等、大多仰給於英美、英美兩國對日貿易、合計佔日本與非日圓染團國家間貿易額之四分之三、在日本、英美之進口貨、佔百分之七十五、日本出口貨品到英美的、佔百分之七十、允以自美國夏威夷菲列濱之進口額數量最大、合計　十萬萬五千二百萬日圓、等於非日圓國家對日輸出之百分之四十八、此項統計說明如美對日實施全面之經濟封鎖、將使日本失去半數之進口貨品、日本去年由英輸入之貨品、値價六萬萬二千五百萬日圓、如英拒以此項貨品供日、則日本勢又將失去百分之二十八之進口貨、在巴拿馬·福克蘭羣島·新嘉坡·等英美海軍根據地、日本輸入進口貨百分之二十、故太平洋戰爭一起、日本將失去非日圓集團國家進口貨之百分之九十五</p>
<p>一日開戰　不堪設想</p>
<p>至於出口方面、去年日本對非日圓國家之貿易、為十八萬萬三千四百萬日圓、其中運銷英美者佔十三萬萬日圓、故如英美實施聯合封鎖、日本出口貨將减少百分之七十五、而日本商船航錢、大都在英美勢力範圍內、所以戰爭一起、日本將無法與非日圓集團之國家繼續貿易、果英美與日終止商業關係、當然雙方咸蒙痛苦、但英美所受者較諸日本、則微乎其微、英美　出口商業、日本僅佔百分之五、故英警所受損　　渺、尤以對於英美國防、毫無關係、反顧日本、完全不同、　事一旦爆發、將失去四分之三之正常商業、失去原料·機器·飛機油·與棉毛織物、此種物品不能從別處得到、在日本本部或佔領區內、亦無法生產、祗能　用所儲物資、迨全數用罄、則必遭受物資缺乏嚴重之恐慌</p>
<p>英美政策　今非昔比</p>
<p>在英美實　經濟封鎖極為可能之時、日本已處歧路之上、向英美投降乎、抑或與　美開戰、事實上日本對英美妥協，固非所願、　與英開戰、又將遇經濟上之危機、目前日本所企求者、為　國速在歐洲戰勝英美、則日本可在遠東一舉　驅英美於　東之外、但此「良機」何日到來、猶渺茫無期、且一再蹉跎所儲物資、將日益减少、此為今日日本外交之苦悶、而目前對英美之强硬態度、實屬虛張聲勢、無非欲以欺詐手段、誘致英美讓步、而遂其南進之野心、但今日之英美、遠非昔日之英美可比、態度堅決、立塲不移、如日悍然南進、則軍事之還堅、與經濟之封鎖、足可於　年內戰勝日本、反之、因英美在遠東採取堅强之姿態、足以造成中國優良之國際局面、竭力充實中國事事及經濟之蘊藏力、愈深日本在華之泥足、其時日本受英美華三國之包國夾擊、遠東局勢於焉澄淸、而中國將以全新姿態出現、最後勝利之獲得、實為中國遠久前程之保障也、</p>
<h3>滬西徵稅問題　日傳即可解決　雙方從事協議具體細目　「特警」可於下週內成立</h3>

<h3>五敎同一最高哲理</h3>
<p>融五講經社楊中一君，日前講五敎同一之最高哲理，其詞云：各立一宗以為敎誼，是謂宗敎，故有儒，佛，道，耶，回，五敎之分。第標宗雖異而詮理則一，名相儘別而實體不二，五敎各具精誼，而有共同融通之點，則最高之哲學原理是。「一體三位」之說，皆知為耶敎宗誼，抑知正為五敎所同最高哲理之一，略引各敎說以證之。</p>
<p>一，回敎　天方性理引昭微經，「三一非三」，「一而三義」。費隱經，「一真衍化」，即道行推原經，「真一起化，數一成化，體一化化」，此明言三位一體之誼也。</p>
<p>二，耶敎　馬太傳約翰第一書，已含聖父，聖子，聖靈三位同有一體之誼。約翰傳十章，耶穌曰，「爾當都是上帝。」哥林多前書三章，保羅曰，「爾曹是上帝之殿，上帝在其中。」歌羅西一章，保羅曰，「此奧秘即是基督在爾曹心內。」正與耶穌曰，「我與父原為一」同誼。天主聖三論「以絕對言，天主一個也；以對待觀，天主三位也。」「於父歸之能，於子歸之知，於靈歸之善。」蓋父即先體，子如明鏡，靈其所發之輝也。神學家謂：「神而有三重之顯現於異觀」者，故神在此位，同時亦全在他位，是一而三者，非謂神有三位而同一實體，故曰神一也。」</p>
<p>三，佛敎　六十華嚴經夜摩天宮菩薩說偈品，「心佛及眾生，是三無差別。」起信論義記，「眾生真心即諸佛體，更無差別。」觀無量壽經，「諸佛如來是法界身，入一切眾生心想中。是心作佛，是心是佛。」天臺之三法妙，密敎之三平等戒，慧海之「一體三寶」，禪宗之「一體三身」，皆即法報應三之融通於顯密權實者，秘藏記，「自心即實相，實相即本尊，本尊即自心。」蓋因果不二，能所一如，故曰「三無差別。」法華玄義六明六種眷屬中，「眾生如，佛如，一如無二如。」「任運是子，」「眾聖中尊世尊之父。」「是吾子，」佛敎之「慈父」「佛子」，與三位一體，正可相印。</p>
<p>四，道敎　「一炁化三清，」道敎建宗最普遍之旨也。道德經十四章，「此三者不可致詰，泥而為一，」亦言三一之誼。四十二章，「道生一，一生二，二生三，三生萬物。」道家標道為宗，故主道為體。所生之一二三者，即一故神，兩故化，三為天地人之道也。張載之一神兩化，即老子之同出異名，孔易之太極是生兩儀也。乾始坤生，稱父稱母。故二十一章，四十二章說「父」，一章，二十章說「母」，四章說「子」，二十五章「有物混成」，「字之四道」，與一體三位之說，　合符節。</p>
<p>五，儒敎　劉歆三統曆，漢書律曆志，並曰，「太極元氣，函三為一。」易緯乾鑿度，「易始終一，分於二，能於三，」鄭玄注，「太極函三為一，相並俱生。」故河圖代姓紀，「以一為太極。」楊簡慈湖已易，「一者，吾之一也，不可言也，不可知也。」「三者形也，一都性也。」蓋不可道，不可名者，道之藏諸密體也。一陰一陽者，道之彰為象，繼善成性者，道之發為用，道不遠人，而原出於大，其為物不貳，則其生物不測，不測之謂神也。孟子曰，「人皆可以為亮。」「聖人者先得我心之同然，」故陽明謂「滿街都是聖人，」佛家謂「眾生悉具佛性，」其說豈有異哉！</p>
<h3>綁匪預伏弄口圖綁顏料巨商　捕房得報拘獲七犯</h3>

<h3>减費</h3>
<p>— 榮耀</p>
<p>一個星期四的下午，家裏來了一封信，拆開一看，信上只寥寥的幾個字：</p>
<p>「　學期學費，經余四出設法，總算受盡白眼，才借到五十塊錢，茲已由郵寄下。父字』</p>
<p>看完了信，心裏感到一陣極端的難過；同時，又想到下學期學費已從五十塊增到七十塊時，無限的愁慮，更湧上了心頭。</p>
<p>整個晚上，便給困在愁城，心裏却在計算，怎樣去獲得那短少的二十塊錢？</p>
<p>從家裹的來信中，可以看出家裏的境况是多麼的困難，如果再寫信去要錢的話，除了讓那衰弱的老父多增點痛苦外，根本是沒有希望。再說到借吧，一個舉目無親的異鄕客，在這貧苦者的呻吟聲籠罩下的孤島，要想借錢，那才眞是做夢。</p>
<p>想了一整夜，最後才決定向學校裏請求一下减費。</p>
<p>第二天，從郵局裹領了錢回來，帶着滿懷熱望，興忽忽地朝着學校走去。</p>
<p>學校門口的一幅巨大的招生廣告，遠遠地便觸進我的眼簾，尤其是那幾個『本校設有减費免費學額多名』的紅色大字，更特別惹人注目，我不禁為自己慶幸，加速了脚步，踏進了校門。</p>
<p>一間斗大的辦公室裹，早已給來繳費的人擠得『水洩不通』，果然是生意興隆，只喜得那坐在繳費處的校長先生，一張胖臉，笑得连眼睛也不見了。好容易才擠進了人羣，向着繳費處的校長先生走去。</p>
<p>『啊！是繳費嗎？請坐，請坐』！一副笑臉相迎。</p>
<p>『是的，校長先生，不過我想請求减點學費，可以嗎？』我必恭必敬地答道。</p>
<p>『怎麼，减費？哦！眞對不起，本校可沒有道樣的規定。』他冷冷地低下了頭去數桌上，鈔票，我却感到大大的失望。</p>
<p>可是眉頭一縐，想到校門外廣吿上的减費大字，素來笨拙的我，居然靈機一動，來一下『以子之矛攻子之盾』。</p>
<p>『咦！那麼校鬥外的廣吿上，不是明明寫着可以减費的嗎』。我理直氣壯地說道。</p>
<p>『唔，這個……』·他顯然沒有防到我這一着。</p>
<p>光明之火，又復燃起在我心頭，我便毫不遲疑地繼續請求道：『校長，請你看在我的成績上面，幫助一下吧』！我拿出了袋裹的成績單。『雖然，校裏經費的枯竭，我也知道的，要不是校長你竭力維持，還開得成嗎？我也是迫不得已才這樣的啊』。我更順便給他戴上一頂高帽子，拍一拍馬屁。</p>
<p>『是呀，你試想想，本校每月的開支是多麼地鉅，單說這校舍吧，每月便得花上千把塊錢，近來敎員們又都鬧着加薪，我們又得不到敎育部的津貼，這不是叫人為難嗎』？他訴怨似地說了一大篇，隨後拿起我的成績單看了一看，便繼續說道：『現在這樣吧，看你的成績還不錯，减你十塊錢吧』。</p>
<p>「先生，能不能再减十塊錢？」像商店裹顧客的還價一樣，我再度的要求。</p>
<p>「唔，不行，這已是最大的讓步了，要是再减一點，難道叫我們去喝西北風不成？要是你還不滿意的話，那你儘可轉學，可是畢業班別校是不招收的呢。哈哈。」他陰險地一笑，便向着註冊處走去了。</p>
<p>唉，完了，講了半天，才只减去十塊錢，中甚麼用？沒奈何，垂頭喪气，踏上歸途，抵家，倒頭便睡。</p>
<p>第一天，看看實在沒有辦法了，便狠一狠心，把大衣脫下，往腋下一挾，走上街去，像小偷一樣地竄進一間當店的大門，閉上眼睛，把大衣向上一拋，說聲，「十五塊」。從高高的櫃台上，擲下了十五塊錢，和一陣輕蔑的冷笑，我惶恐地逃出了當店；一陣割臉的西北風，把我整個身體吹得像樹葉子一樣簌簌地發抖。硬着頭皮，咬緊牙關，胃着寒風，施出閃電的速度，一口氣跑到学校。</p>
<p>踏進辦公室，便向那坐在繳費去抽烟的胖校長走去，經過那熊熊的火爐，我忍不住站了一會兒。</p>
<p>「是繳費嗎？」仍是那副笑臉。</p>
<p>「是的，」我便把那厚厚的一疊學費送過去。</p>
<p>「咦！怎麼只有六十塊錢？」眞是貴人多「忘」。</p>
<p>「昨天你答應的，减費十元。」</p>
<p>「唔，你是减費生。」</p>
<p>喉嚨加響了一倍，眼睛却向着那站在註冊處的學生，家長們射去，生怕他們聽不見似的。接着便把鈔票塞進他裝滿了鈔票的皮包裏去，提起筆裏寫收據。</p>
<p>「請付兩塊錢的手續費。」</p>
<p>「甚麼手續費，先生？」</p>
<p>「减費手續費。」</p>
<p>我呆住了。</p>
<p>「快點，這是本校的校規。」他惡狠狠地說道。</p>
<p>沒奈何，只好把那預備買書的五塊錢摸出來。</p>
<p>「這裏找還你兩塊錢。」收據，鈔票，一起擲了過來。</p>
<p>「咦！怎麼只找給我兩塊，」看了一下手裏的鈔票，我驚異地問道。</p>
<p>「唔，不錯，因為繳費昨天截止，今天你遲緻了一天，便罰金一元，這是本校的校規。」說着，從桌上拾起了那半段雪茄烟，又滿面春風地在吸了起來。</p>
<p>我不禁倒抽了一口冷氣，暗駡聲「好刁滑的東四」。</p>
<p>步出後門，只見那幅巨大的廣吿，隨風飄蕩，尤其是那紅色的大字，更像放出異光，向着行人「顯媚。」</p>
<p>我深深地嘆了一口氣，摸一摸袋裹「碩果僅存」的兩塊錢和一張當票。</p>

<h3>落地時辰差幾分</h3>
<p>— 任炯</p>
<p>人是一樣人，落地時辰差幾分。</p>
<p>不錯，這話在我們耳朶邊似乎已經聽得爛熟了。可是，很少人在注意這句話裏的毒素和其中的奥妙的，甚至存着一個驚人數字的儍瓜們，還拿它當做「金玉良言」而來作為聊以自慰的不二法鬥的，這眞叫寃哉枉也！</p>
<p>這不是在下誇海口，你不信只要看社會上的每一個角落裏，到處都充潑着抱有這種想頭的人。不論是家庭婦女，工廠職工，或是生活狀况非常痛苦的人，尤其是寡婦，尼姑，和尙之類的人物，他們感到痛苦的時候，就詛咒起自己的命來了。算命先生說我是「勞碌命」，於是做了一生的牛馬，也就一概歸併在「命苦」兩個宇上，再也不想翻身。他們連做夢也沒有想到過，說這是有着原因的，至於原因是什麼，他們就更覺得胡塗渺茫起來了，不過就跟發財人的「落地時辰差幾分」而已！</p>
<p>因此，那些專門想出法子來叫人受他指揮的統治者們滿足了，這些願意聽命受用的笨伯們，居然就中了這些別人吃苦自已享樂的傢伙們的圈套，於是，這少數人就可以世世代代的剝削別人下去，而大多數人也就歸在命苦上頭而永遠被咀嚼着，這樣便形成了今日的社會。</p>
<p>所以，我們耍指出命是從瞎子（看不到事物的人）的嘴裏編造出來的，要你吃苦的是今天的社會，與那些造出來的命沒有絲毫的關聯，請別再被騙下去而永遠被人壓得喘不過氣來吧，它正像那些寡婦的死掉丈夫一樣，丈夫的死是有着促其死的原因存在的，也小跟所謂的命有關。</p>
<p>請相信命的朋友醒醒吧，把你們詛咒命，怨恨命的時間，和被內心咀嚼着的痛苦搬到努力，創造新社會這標的下去吧。雖然，今天在生活上還是痛苦的，但這痛苦的分量，却有着很大的差別，而且內心上倒反是愉快的，到那時，眞實的世界一定會吿訴你們命運究竟是什麼一會事了！我們大家來切身體騐吧！</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（四）意外的遇合</p>
<p>就在這時候，茶房已把麵和鍋貼端來了，趙四也就不和秋海棠客氣，拈起一雙竹筷，使得比什麼都純熟，不消幾分鍊，桌子上便祇剩了一個空碗和一個空碟子。</p>
<p>趙四挺着肚子，大搖大擺的出去之後，秋海棠便把榮奎叫來，檢出一件夾大褂和二十塊錢的鈔票，囑咐他給趙玉崑送去。這裏就顯出榮奎的聰明來了，他只自作主張的買了一瓶五茄皮跟幾毛錢的乾牛肉送去，趙玉崑得了，反比什麽都高興，而榮奎自己，却就毫不費力的賺了十幾塊錢。</p>
<p>當他志得意滿的走回天津飯店時，秋海棠和馬金壽等一班人，正給沈麻子的許多徒弟圍在屋子裏，使用種種的恐嚇，要他們把已收的包銀還出來。</p>
<p>榮奎一瞧情形不對，伊躱在自己的屋子裏，再也不敢走上去；還虧秋海棠三次上天津來唱戲，都住在這家旅館裹，掌櫃的和他很說得來，而且在地面上也有些勢力，便做好做歹的從中調解，的定第二天再談，才把那一羣人打發了出去的</p>
<p>「要退包銀也可以，只是他們還得先把咱們的行頭放出來！」秋海棠也不是一個毫無主意的人，便給旅館的掌櫃這樣說</p>
<p>「這話當然是對的，」掌櫃呻吟着說：「只是你們有人打壞了沈麻子，話就難說得多了！」</p>
<p>提到這一點，秋海棠委實一籌莫展了，其餘那些人當然更想不出什麽好的計較來。</p>
<p>趙四直到飯後才回來。（四五）</p>

<h3>歐洲大戰聲中最流行的歌曲</h3>
<p>— 樹嘉</p>
<p>有許多歌曲，常常隨着戰爭而流行起來。這次歐戰中最流行的是“Beer　Barrel　Polka”。加拿大軍隊在英國登陸時，澳洲和紐西蘭軍隊在中東戰塲作戰時，去年英軍在法國助戰時，都唱着這首輕鬆的調子，以代進行曲；甚至在突襲時的英國防空壕中，也有人在唱着。這首歌已銷去一百萬張歌譜，至今還是不衰。</p>
<p>其次是在美國銷路最佳的一曲名“South　of　The　Border”在英國也極受歡迎。此曲是英國名作家曲家康納第和卡爾兩人合作的，約銷去了五十萬份歌譜。再次是“Wish　Me　Luck　as　You　Wave　Ｍe　Good-bye”至今已售出歌譜四十五萬份；英國女明星葛蕾絲斐特慰勞英國三軍時，常高歌此曲，深得士兵們的愛好。</p>
<p>銷路輪到第四的歌曲是卡爾獨著的“Some　where　in　France”歌譜售去四十萬份。自從英軍從鄧扣克撤退後，這首歌才漸漸的不常聽到。</p>
<p>以上四去，是這次歐戰中最流行的歌曲，但歌譜的銷數，和上次世界大戰時英國流行歌曲比較起來，不逮遠甚，例如世界大戰時的名歌“It's　a　Long，Long　Way　to　Tipperary”歌譜銷去五百萬份“Roses　of　Picardy”三百萬份，“Keep　the　Home　Fire　Burning”也在一百萬份以上。</p>
<p>出版商說流行歌曲歌譜銷路的减少，是因為無綫電發達的緣故；現在一首歌曲，一旦風行，無綫電中便一再播唱，約過了十三個星期，便聽得膩了，於是那首歌曲的「壽命」漸漸告終；但在世界大戰時，每首流行歌曲的平均生命，約有兩年之久。</p>
<p>象徵着全世球人民希望日後安樂的歌曲，也有極廣的銷路。某出版商請名作曲家Irving　Berlin　著歌一曲，來表示這種思想，他便依言著成“It's　a　Lovely　Day　Tomorrow”銷去十萬份。其他銷數很廣的歌曲有“It's　a　Hap　Hap　Happy　Day”“We'll　Go　Smiling　Along”等。</p>
<p>這次歐戰中含有時事性的歌曲，當以“Hang　Out　the　Washing　on　the　Siegfried　Line”最風行一時，售去歌譜三十五萬份。出版商承認這首歌近來銷數已跌，因為歐洲西綫的戰事已告結束，但英軍終有一日派兵在歐洲登陸，展開陸　大戰時，這首歌曲必將再度盛行一時。</p>
<p>此外，英國民眾夜來常受空襲擾騷，不得不避身防空壕中，於是有一首「晚安」歌，常掛在他們口邊，這首歌的詞很簡單，大意是「請弗因我呵欠而認為失禮，我明晨必須起身呢，晚安，晚安，燈帶了嗎，帶了；防毒面具帶了嗎，帶了，很好，晚安，晚安。」</p>

<h3>Two Consecutive Meetings Held by the National Political Council Yesterday: Telegram Supporting Chairman Chiang to Strive for Final Victory, Resolution to Organize a Price Problem Review Committee, Proposal Review Committee and Conveners Approved</h3>
<p>Chongqing. The Second Session of the First Plenary Meeting of the Second National Political Council was held at 8:00 AM on the 3rd. Attending were Presidium members Chiang Kai-shek, Zhang Boling, Zuo Shunsheng, Zhang Junli, Wu Yifang, and councilors Chen Shiquan, Wang Huayi, and others, totaling 171 people. Also present were over 30 heads and secretaries of various Yuan, ministries, and commissions, including Wang Shijie. Chairman Chiang gave a salute, read the minutes of the preparatory meeting and the first meeting, followed by an education report from Minister of Education Chen Lifu, explaining the government's measures for higher education, general education, social education, overseas Chinese education, frontier education, and war zone education. He detailed increases in various education expenses and the number of students at all levels of schools and presented statistical reports. He also elaborated on the livelihood security and relief for school faculty, staff, and students. After the report, Councilors Kuang Bingshun and others raised inquiries about overseas Chinese education, which Minister Chen answered on the spot. After a ten-minute break, Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang reported that the Ministry of Social Affairs was established in November of last year, and its current work focuses on formulating policy guidelines and administrative plans. He then detailed the Ministry of Social Affairs' plans for social welfare, public organization and training, and cooperative undertakings, and explained the functions of the Ministry of Social Affairs and local social administration organizations. By the end of the report, it was nearly 12:00 PM. Then, upon the temporary proposal of Chen Bo and 74 others, it was requested that the Director of the National Food Administration report to the assembly on the food management situation and that the assembly organize a special committee to review the price issue. It was resolved that the assembly would organize a Price Problem Review Committee, and all proposals related to the price issue would be reviewed by this committee. Finally, upon the temporary proposal of Kong Geng and 63 others, it was requested that the assembly, in its name, send a telegram supporting Chairman Chiang's address at the meeting, declaring that the war must strive for final victory and that national reconstruction must achieve national defense security. The entire assembly unanimously approved, and the assembly adjourned in a solemn and enthusiastic atmosphere. The assembly then held its third meeting at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, attended by 146 people including Wang Zhenxin and Yan Huatang. Zuo Shunsheng presided. After the salute, the secretariat reported that Councilor Afushou had arrived in Chongqing from Qinghai but was unable to attend due to illness from the arduous journey and was hospitalized at Kuanren Hospital. Subsequently, Minister of Transportation Zhang Jia'ao reported on the construction of railway and highway projects under difficult circumstances, as well as aviation telecommunications equipment, the increase of railway lines, the improvement of waterways, the development of postal savings undertakings, and the separation of postal transport agencies and routes. He further elaborated on the current transportation situation and its difficulties. After the report, councilors raised more than ten inquiries regarding the consolidation of southwest and northwest highways and the transportation of central relocation areas, the connection of central and local transportation management agencies, the adjustment of the Sichuan River shipping management agencies, the construction of highways and railways in the southwest and northwest, and transportation conditions, which Minister Zhang answered orally on the spot. The work reports of the Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuan were submitted in written form and were not presented orally. After a ten-minute break, the meeting continued. The chairman announced a change in the agenda, first discussing the list of members and conveners of the review committee proposed by the presidium, which was passed without objection. Subsequently, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Chen Jitang reported on the administrative policies and implementation of work in agriculture and forestry. Following this, Minister of Interior Zhou Zhongyue gave a report, elaborating on the implementation plan of the new county system, the formulation of laws and regulations related to the new county system, the implementation of the new county system in various provinces, and opium suppression measures. Finally, councilors raised inquiries about the difficulties in funding and personnel for the implementation of the new county system in various provinces and whether there were solutions, which Minister Zhou agreed to answer in writing. At 6:30 PM, the meeting was adjourned. (Third day dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing. The Fifth Plenary Session of the previous National Political Council was held in April of last year. Between that session and this session, there was a gap of ten months. During this period, important developments occurred in the domestic and international situation. After listening to the government's report, the councilors raised many inquiries, including the following regarding foreign affairs: (1) the truth about the Japanese advance southward and our countermeasures; (2) the government's countermeasures against the German-Italian-Japanese alliance; (3) the inside story of Japan's attempt to conclude a treaty with the Soviet Union; (4) the true meaning of Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke's statement that he wanted to conquer Oceania; (5) whether Mr. Colebrook's visit to China resulted in any concrete agreements with our government regarding aid to China. Regarding economic matters, there were inquiries about: (1) recent proposals for the government to monopolize the sale of grain and the government's opinion on this; (2) whether future trade policies would adopt control measures or free trade policies; (3) the high prices in various rear areas and whether the government has more effective measures to stabilize prices; (4) the inconsistency of price indices in various regions and whether the government has concrete measures to ensure the smooth flow of goods in the future. The heads of the competent authorities have agreed to provide answers to all of the above cases on a scheduled basis. (Third day dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing. The Central News Agency stated yesterday that this session of the National Political Council will resolve the disagreements between various political parties, the price issue, and constitutional matters. The Central News Agency also reported that when the meeting was held on Saturday, due to the absence of the Communist Party representatives, Jiao Jiasen of the National Socialist Party and the famous educator Huang Yanpei proposed postponing the meeting on Saturday afternoon to allow the Communist Party representatives to reconsider. The proposal was passed by an average annual decline, but the Communist Party still hesitated, so the meeting continued. (Third day, United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang's Address at the Second National Political Council Meeting: Strive for Final Victory and Complete Secure National Defense</h3>
<p>Chongqing. Chairman Chiang addressed the opening day (2nd) of the First Plenary Session of the Second National Defense Political Council, originally stating: "Fellow councilors, today is the first gathering of the Second National Political Council. On behalf of the National Defense Supreme Council, I extend a warm welcome to all councilors. As this arduous war enters its fifth year, with our entire nation concentrating its efforts in a struggle for survival, it is of utmost importance that our nation's talented individuals deliberate on national affairs. Councilors from the occupied provinces have overcome dangers and difficulties to attend this meeting. This spirit of jointly facing national disaster and sharing the same boat is truly a most precious and glorious memorial in the history of our nation's struggle. Recalling the establishment of the First Political Council on the anniversary of the first year of the war, over the past three years, through five gatherings, you have assisted the government, implemented national policies, and made significant contributions to resistance and reconstruction. This consistent sincerity and magnificent strength has not only attracted worldwide attention but has also inspired the military and civilians throughout the country. Now, the world situation is becoming more tense, and the situation of our country's war is becoming more important. Therefore, the mission of this council is not only to inherit the glorious achievements of the previous council but also to adapt to the needs of our new situation of resistance and reconstruction and to make further progress. The expectations of the military and civilians throughout the country and the government for you, gentlemen, are therefore even greater and more important. Today, I would first like to make a brief report on the government's policy direction since the convocation of the Political Council and the situation of both China and Japan, and take this opportunity to state my personal beliefs about the future of the country. Since the Provisional National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang resolved the Outline for Resistance and National Reconstruction, and the First Political Council unanimously resolved to support it in July of the 27th year, this outline has become the creed followed by the military and civilians throughout the country and the fundamental policy direction of the wartime government. Each time the Political Council meets, it proposes many important proposals based on this outline. For the past three years, the government's work can be said to be entirely based on the</p>
<p>Outline for Resistance and National Reconstruction and striving to comply with the resolutions of the Political Council. The detailed process will be reported by various Yuan, ministries, and commissions. The situation since the last adjournment will be left to the relevant departments to report in detail. Broadly speaking, the main purpose of all government decisions is to seek the growth of combat power and the establishment of a national reconstruction scale. The preliminary work of national reconstruction is mainly to create the rule of law, prepare for constitutional rule, and promote local self-government below the county level to complete political construction. At the same time, we must strengthen production, develop transportation, improve people's livelihoods, and implement economic controls to vigorously promote economic construction. Due to various factual limitations and the evolution of the war situation, many have not yet achieved full effectiveness. In this regard, the government will strive to promote in the future and hopes that this Council will do its best to assist in order to thoroughly complete it. Looking back at the evolution of the situation between China and Japan over the past two years, it can be said to be completely in line with what we expected at the beginning of our decision to wage war.</p>
<p>Completely consistent. Since the war entered its second phase, the Japanese have gradually been in a military stalemate. Although the Japanese blindly advanced in southern Guangxi and western Hubei, the Japanese troops in southern Guangxi eventually collapsed last autumn, and the Japanese troops in western Hubei are also in a dilemma. Looking at the overall war situation, the Japanese have become tired and their troops are exhausted, while our combat strength and attacking spirit are on the rise. The Japanese military has now been deeply mired in the quagmire, and it can be said that the Japanese have already realized their failure. In terms of diplomacy, the Japanese, knowing that they have completely failed militarily and cannot be salvaged, have had no choice but to speculate and seek opportunities,妄想在外交上</p>
<p>Seeking a way out. They have sometimes enticed and sometimes threatened the countries concerned in East Asia, but today, the friendly nations not only clearly recognize that there is no room for compromise with Japan, but they also have a deep belief in China's inevitable victory. The friendly nations not only unanimously reject Japan's inducements and threats but also continue to increase their assistance to us. All countries whose interests are related to the Pacific have seen through Japan's endless ambitions and have taken resolute steps. The situation in the Pacific is becoming clearer, which is the greatest internal fear of the Japanese and a sign of the thorough clarification of the world situation. In the political field, the Japanese have been constantly creating peace rumors over the past few years in an attempt to shake our will to fight and shake our government's</p>
<p>Basic national policy. Not long ago, the "Wang-Japan Secret Agreement" was officially exposed to the world, but our nationwide warfare is becoming more and more resolute. The Japanese have exhausted all kinds of schemes and launched various rumor offensives, but our military and civilians have always remained unshaken. On the contrary, countries around the world have become more aware of Japan's ambitions. This is due to the righteousness of our position and the firmness of our will. Therefore, in the initial stage, we were using lone army struggles to contain Japan, but today, our warfare has formed the central force for the joint sanctions of Japan by the Pacific countries. And again, from the internal perspective of Japan, Japan created a "new political system" because of its political bankruptcy and created a new economic system or something because of its economic bankruptcy. However, this method of patching up the cracks and draining the pond to catch the fish cannot alleviate Japan's crisis of collapse, nor can it pass his</p>
<p>The purpose of prolonging the last gasp of breath. Reviewing the past two years, we have finally broken through the last difficult and dangerous environment and established the foundation for victory. This is by no means something that a small number of people can achieve through their efforts. This is entirely due to the common efforts of the military and civilians throughout the country, enduring pain, hardship, and vowing to fight to the death. The achievement of this achievement has involved the fresh blood of many martyrs, the sacrifice of many loyal and brave people, countless touching historical facts, and the practical contributions of countless unsung heroes and people of lofty ideals who have buried their heads and worked hard. As the commander, I can only be extremely inspired and look forward to reporting to my countrymen in one out of ten thousand. What I want to ask everyone to pay attention to now is that the failure of the Japanese has already been decided. The general situation is very beneficial to our country's warfare, but we must make plans for the most difficult warfare and the most dangerous preparations. We must not only be more cautious and more diligent as</p>
<p>Victory approaches, but also have a new understanding of the current world situation. My personal observations on the current situation and my beliefs about the future of the country: After the outbreak of the European War, the war disaster for mankind has an increasing crisis. In the process of the European War, the progress of world tactics and weapons, as well as the successive falls of many small and large countries, have shocked the entire world, especially every country must thoroughly realize that if they do not rise up and catch up and engage in the struggle for survival, there will be no room for independence and freedom. This deep and broad thinking of national struggle is only in its initial stage at present. We firmly believe that the general trend of the world must conform to the traditional beliefs of our nation and must be conducive to our country's resistance and construction. However, we must recognize that if a country does not have</p>
<p>The full determination and strength to defend itself will never survive in this fighting world. In East Asia, the Japanese, because of their failure to invade China, want to complete their aggressive dream, advancing southward at every step. However, this is just a means, and destroying China is actually their goal. Moreover, at the beginning of their advance southward, they will definitely launch a final offensive against us. Therefore, the invasion of China and the advance southward are one thing, not two things. The Japanese so-called "New Order in Greater East Asia" and "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" are even greater insults to our country and the entire East Asia. Why put a "Greater" on the "New Order in East Asia"? The meaning is nothing more than to seize the vast resources and territories of Southeast Asia to enhance its aggressive power, completely block China, and weaken our combat power in order to finally realize its dream of dominating the Pacific and destroying China. As you all know, Southeast Asia is not only where more than 1.2 million of our overseas Chinese</p>
<p>The second homeland where they live and thrive is also where the safety and survival of our nation lie. The Japanese invasion of Southeast Asia is undoubtedly the greatest threat to China's survival and national defense security. We must recognize that although the Japanese have already failed, they have no intention of regretting their mistakes. Moreover, because of the outbreak of the European War, they have become more greedy and妄想to speculate in order to achieve their goals. We must not only resolutely fight to the end to safeguard the independence and survival of our country, but also use our strength to break the deadlock in the world and East Asia caused by the Japanese consortium, especially the last stage of the survival of both China and Japan. (Second Day Dispatch, to be continued)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>German Troops Enter Bulgaria</h3>
<p>The next act of dramatic evolution in the European situation is about to unfold, and we are now at its eve. During the recent two weeks before this eve, Bulgaria has appeared as the protagonist. On March 17th, it signed a non-aggression treaty with Turkey, and on the first of this month, it joined the Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan, seemingly a success of multilateral diplomacy. However, the ensuing developments have proven that it is not the protagonist, but a puppet being manipulated, a stage being commandeered. Bulgaria only declared its independence in 1908, and only gained international recognition in the following year, a mere thirty-three years ago. On the 2nd of this month, the Bulgarian government and the public were preparing to celebrate the next day's Independence Day, but as a result of joining the Axis powers the day before, German troops, in the guise of an ally protecting Bulgaria from British attacks, and with the consent of the Bulgarian government as a basis, marched mightily and unimpeded into Bulgarian territory. Yesterday's dispatch estimated that the total number of German land and air forces entering Bulgaria had reached 500,000, immediately occupying the entirety of Bulgaria. According to German claims, the people cheered and welcomed the German troops upon their entry. The Bulgarian Prime Minister also addressed the Parliament, stating: "Although Bulgaria has allowed German troops to enter the country, it will still fulfill its treaty obligations, will not change its peaceful policies, will not launch any attacks, and will not threaten the interests of other countries. The German troops will remain in Bulgaria for a limited period, with the aim of maintaining peace and order, and will also consider Bulgaria's treaty obligations to its neighbors, so as not to cause Bulgaria to engage in any behavior that violates these obligations." The Parliament approved this by a majority vote. This is an extremely brief scene on the stage, without the sound of cannons, without the light of fire, without bloodshed, but it can also be regarded as a one-act tragedy of swallowing blood and tears and putting on a forced smile.</p>
<p>Although the dramatic changes in the European situation are about to unfold, it is still difficult to predict how Mr. Hitler will direct the next act on this eve. Judging by Italy's intentions, after conquering Bulgaria, it will conquer Yugoslavia; then it will give Greece a set of civility before resorting to force, or simply omit this set and launch a large-scale bloody battle in that direction, hoping to defeat Britain and Greece, and urgently seek to save his partner Italy, and complete his long-proclaimed spring offensive; this is the most imaginable trend, but it is only one of the possible directions, and it cannot be said to be entirely inevitable. Among them, Yugoslavia, which is now trapped in a large encirclement, can be said to have already been destined for such a fate, following in Bulgaria's footsteps, or even getting worse.</p>
<p>Mr. Hitler has initiated everything, but how can he dominate everything! If he were in charge, then the Union Jack would have been hoisted over Buckingham Palace in London last autumn, and the Roman Empire would have been established in Africa last winter. As for what he initiated, one cannot but admire his careful consideration and decisive actions. From the German troops' entry into Bulgaria, it can be seen that the signing of the non-aggression treaty between Turkey and Bulgaria was a very important diplomatic pre-arrangement for him, so as to avoid stimulating Turkey when coercing Bulgaria to join the Axis and Bulgaria tolerating the entry of German troops, forcing Turkey to fight alongside Britain. From the large number and speed of the German troops entering Bulgaria, it can be seen that the previous control of Romania was not entirely for the Romanian oil mines, and its goal was very far. Therefore, yesterday's news reported that only 6,000 German troops remained in Romania. Proving the above, in the Bulgarian Prime Minister's speech on maintaining peaceful policies and fulfilling obligations, on the one hand, it indicates the nature of this evolution, although it allows German troops to pass through, it is not to follow Germany in the war, which is exactly in line with the "benevolent neutrality" in Nazi philosophy; on the other hand, it stabilized Turkey with treaty obligations, so that it would not form opposition or even confrontation with the German troops entering Bulgaria due to other obligations. These are all obtained from the surface. It is very likely that there are other tacit understandings behind it. The fundamental reason and method for Germany's rapid advance in the Balkans could not have allowed the Soviet Union and Turkey to remain indifferent and unworried and dangerous; however, the fact that only 6,000 German troops remain in Romania may be regarded as a tacit understanding between Germany and the Soviet Union, that Germany will never threaten the lower reaches of the Danube River controlled by the Soviet Union through Romania, and the Bulgarian Prime Minister's guarantee that the German troops will remain in Bulgaria for a limited period may be regarded as a tacit understanding between Germany and Turkey that Germany will never threaten the Dardanelles Strait controlled by Turkey through Bulgaria. What the Soviet Union and Turkey are most concerned about is the lower reaches of the Danube and the Dardanelles Strait, and if these are always in their control, they will also shield the safety of the entire Black Sea.</p>
<p>All of the above are initiated by Mr. Hitler. To push its trend back, we have to see how Britain, on the other hand, will fight? The past and future in between are difficult to understand clearly; just as British Foreign Secretary Eden and Chief of Staff General Dill recently visited Turkey, they certainly had a major mission, and now they have left Turkey happily. What concrete achievements have been made, and how can Britain and Turkey cooperate? Just as Britain and Greece and Germany and Italy will soon have a nearly decisive battle, what will be the gains and losses? These are all impossible to predict, and what is even more unknown is what kind of joy and separation the interests of Turkey have permeated between Britain and the Soviet Union? Judging from general reasoning, even if the Soviet Union and Germany have any tacit understanding, or there is a direct tacit understanding between Germany and Turkey, or an indirect tacit understanding with the Soviet Union intervening, at most they will tolerate it temporarily; playing with soldiers is like playing with fire, and there will be a day when the flames cannot be controlled and will spread. Moreover, the relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany, whether thick or thin, friendly or hostile, is bound to be inversely proportional to the German momentum; therefore, all dramatic changes are coming!</p>
<h3>Prelude to the German Spring Offensive: Complete Control of Bulgaria; German Vanguard Nears Greece; Bulgarian Government Decides to Temporarily Close Borders</h3>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command issued a communiqué last night, stating roughly that the German High Command is aware of British intentions in Southeastern Europe, and has taken precautionary measures, entering Bulgaria with the permission of the Bulgarian government. The German army was warmly welcomed by the Bulgarian people. (Naval Agency Urgent Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Berlin: Sources familiar with the matter claim that the German entry into Bulgaria is aimed at protecting Bulgarian interests and thwarting British attempts to wage war there. Political circles say Bulgaria's accession to the Axis is a military victory for Germany, and that other countries will soon follow, implying Yugoslavia. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Sofia: Several vehicles transported German troops to Sofia last night, where they were warmly welcomed by the public. German aircraft also circled in the air. Foreign newspapers' reports that Sofia is in a "state of military emergency" do not match the facts. The arrival of German troops in Sofia merely adds new meaning to a state of peace. (Haitong Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Sofia: Today is Bulgaria's Independence Day. While German troops successively entered Bulgarian territory yesterday, Bulgaria began its commemorative celebrations. Sofia is very quiet. Yesterday was Sunday, and the main streets were still bustling with people. All public institutions hung national flags to celebrate, with some also displaying swastika flags, indicating to the public that Bulgaria has signed the Axis Pact. However, this did not arouse much interest among the Bulgarian people at this time. Armed German soldiers began appearing in Sofia on Saturday afternoon. Many officers arrived successively yesterday. However, there are currently not many German soldiers in Sofia. Shortly after noon, key personnel from the German General Staff arrived in cars, escorted by motorcycle soldiers wearing steel helmets and military trucks. The officers carried maps and were mostly in military uniform, with some wearing civilian clothes. According to Axis sources, Germany has announced its intention to occupy Bulgaria on Tuesday. (Reuters Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Sofia: Reliable sources say German vanguard troops have approached the Greek border. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>London: According to recent reports from Sofia, the main movements of German troops appear to be southward and southwestward, aiming for the Greek border and the Rhodope Mountain passes. It is reported that the German army crossed the Danube River from Romania via pontoon bridges to enter Bulgaria. (Reuters Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Berlin: Berlin's Essen National Daily News commented on the German entry into Bulgaria this morning, stating roughly that this move can dispel foreign press speculation about Bulgaria's accession. The German entry into Bulgaria demonstrates the spirit of diplomatic and military cooperation among the Axis powers. Berlin is closely watching British activities in the Mediterranean, but their behavior is risky. Bulgaria's accession to the Tripartite Pact can be seen as a prelude to the German spring offensive, and the best guarantee for Bulgaria's existence. The impact of Bulgaria's accession will be to extend this peaceful policy to other regions. German troops will guarantee Bulgaria's security. Churchill's threat to Bulgaria a few weeks ago will not materialize. The final battle is about to begin. The curtain has not yet been raised, but the combatants have entered their positions. (Haitong Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German News Agency recently issued a telegram from the Bulgarian capital stating that the Bulgarian government has decided to temporarily close the border. (Havas Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Bulgarian King Receives British Envoy: Severance of Relations Only a Matter of Time</p>
<p>Sofia: Bulgarian King Boris received British Envoy Rendel yesterday for ninety minutes. The British envoy declined to reveal the content of the audience. However, the British side indicated that Rendel considered the situation extremely serious, and that the severance of diplomatic relations between Britain and Bulgaria is only a matter of days or hours, and is currently awaiting instructions from London. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Sofia: According to highly reliable sources, the Bulgarian King did not encourage the British envoy to stay. The severance of relations between the two countries is likely to be announced on Wednesday or Thursday this week, and the British envoy is expected to leave Bulgaria next weekend. (Reuters Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>London: The British government has not yet decided whether to maintain or sever relations with Bulgaria after its accession to the Axis. The ambassador to Bulgaria, Rendel, has been authorized to act at his discretion. (Havas Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Vichy: A telegram from Bulgaria received here states that the British military attaché in Bulgaria has left Sofia. (Reuters Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Stockholm: According to reports from London last night, telephone and telegraph communications between London and Bulgaria, except those used by diplomatic circles, have been interrupted. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>London: This morning, British newspapers commented on the weekend's developments in Bulgaria, with the following key points: (1) Warning Bulgaria must bear the consequences of tolerating German occupation; (2) Sympathy for the people of Bulgaria; (3) Britain is prepared for all events in the Balkans. (Reuters Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Yugoslavia Feels Threatened: Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Confer on Political Situation</p>
<p>Belgrade: The Yugoslav Prime Minister suddenly returned to the capital from his country villa yesterday afternoon and conferred with Foreign Minister Marković on the political situation. Marković had just returned to the capital from Vienna this morning. The two then went to see Regent Prince Paul together. The official announcement of the contents of the meeting is pending. (Haitong Dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Belgrade: Reliable sources said yesterday that the smooth entry of German troops into Bulgaria has brought Yugoslavia closer to the Axis. It also said that the German occupation of Bulgaria has greatly changed the situation in the Balkans, including the early end of the Greek-Italian war and leaving Yugoslavia surrounded by Axis countries. Under these circumstances, Yugoslavia must reconsider its policies and can no longer take a close watch and reserve freedom of action. Reliable sources said that close proximity to the Axis would put the country at risk of military surveys to determine territorial boundaries. It is widely believed that Bulgaria will benefit the most because Bulgaria first leaned towards the Axis. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>London: The News Chronicle says German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is preparing to ask Yugoslavia to mediate the Greek-Italian war immediately. If Greece refuses, German troops may advance from Bulgaria and Yugoslavia simultaneously to the Greek border. (International Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Washington: Military circles here announced today that if Yugoslavia joins the Axis, Germany will have more power to make demands on Greece than it does now with its occupation of Bulgaria. Military officials pointed out that Yugoslavia could provide German mechanized units with an easy route into Greece, better than Bulgaria, and avoid the risk of a Turkish flank attack. The Vardar River valley in Yugoslavia has a railway that runs directly to Greece. However, if Germany attacks Greece from Bulgaria, German troops must cross mountainous terrain. Furthermore, if Greece is attacked from Yugoslavia, a large number of troops can be transferred to Bulgaria to protect the flanks of the attacking forces. However, informed sources said that if Britain could or would send sufficient troops to Greece, it could offer serious resistance to the Nazis. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Soviet Union's Current Policy Unchanged: Willing to Improve Relations with Britain and the United States</p>
<p>Ankara: Diplomatic circles here say that the Soviet Union cannot ignore Germany's occupation of Bulgaria, but is currently unable to take any action. At the same time, due to the gradual progress of its military and economic position, the Soviet Union is willing to improve relations with Britain and the United States. Diplomatic circles believe that the Soviet Union is willing to obtain British recognition of its annexed territories in exchange for an economic agreement with Britain. The Soviet Union has also adopted a friendly attitude towards Turkey and will provide assistance if Turkey goes to war with Germany. All of these points were key points in the recent British-Turkish-Soviet talks. British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Cripps has gone to Istanbul en route to Moscow. Before leaving Ankara, he met with the Soviet Ambassador here. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Vichy: After Bulgaria joined the German-Italian-Japanese alliance, diplomatic observers here recently said that the Soviet Union would not react to this. According to reports from Moscow, Soviet officials are currently maintaining silence. However, observing the diplomatic activities of the Soviet government in the past few months, it can be seen that the Soviet Union does not want to abandon its interests in the Balkan Peninsula, especially in areas inhabited by Slavic peoples. As for the Soviet Union's current policy, up to now, it has proven to be of great benefit to the country itself, and there is no reason to change course for the time being. (Havas Dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Chinese Side Denies: Chinese Troops Enter Burma</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesman today criticized Japanese reports that 20,000 Chinese troops had entered the Burma Road, saying that British defenses do not need Chinese assistance. The spokesman said, "Although Burma is governed by Britain, it is still Burma for the Burmese people. How can our troops enter Burma without the permission of China and Burma? The British authorities have repeatedly stated that the defenses of China, Burma, and Malaya have been strengthened, so in fact, we do not need to provide assistance."

<h3>Missionary Dies in Car Accident on Yunnan-Burma Road</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The funeral of 30-year-old American woman, Miss Kiss, who died on the Yunnan-Burma Road last Thursday, is being arranged pending notification of her relatives in the United States. Miss Kiss died on her way from Kunming to Lashio when the car she was traveling in overturned 240 miles from the Burmese border.

<h3>Vichy Accepts Mediation Terms: Cedes Fertile Land to Thailand; Japan Takes Advantage to Win Thai Favor; Leaves Room for Attacking Malaya</h3>
<p>Vichy: Reliable sources announced that France is unwilling to wage a hopeless war against Japan, and would rather cede the most fertile land in Vietnam to Thailand. The Cabinet has passed the terms of Japan's second mediation, in fact because France knows that it cannot resist Japan's military force. This time, France's surrender involves five provinces, namely Luang Prabang in Laos, and all of Pakse (west bank of the Mekong River), Siem Reap, and the northwest Cambodian provinces of Battambang and Kampong Thom. Thailand will thus obtain rich rubber plantations, minerals, and vast rice fields near the Tonle Sap Lake, which can greatly increase Siam's rice production, while rubber and tin are the main points of Thailand's demands. It is rumored that all of Thailand's rubber and tin must be shipped to Japan first. France is actually accepting all the terms, but nominally only yields to Japan's military intimidation and accepts Japan's mediation rather than directly surrendering to Thailand. This decision was made after receiving Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's final warning. At the same time, French cabinet ministers were informed that Japan had stockpiled a large amount of military supplies in Thailand, far more than the Thai army could use. Observers believe that this is to use the Mekong River war to stockpile military supplies, which will definitely be used to attack Singapore in the future. It is also believed that Japan will gain Bangkok's favor without losing a soldier or spending a bullet. By indulging Thailand, it will not only gain a base for taking Singapore but also drive British interests out of Thailand. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Saigon: Authorities here said today that they have not yet received official news from Vichy, so they cannot comment on the situation where France is rumored to have accepted Japan's proposal to cede Laos and Cambodia to Thailand. At the same time, the blackout and military preparations continue. Regarding the Vietnamese-Japanese rice agreement, a rice merchant claimed that after Vietnam fulfills its contract, there will be 50,000 tons of rice left over, which the Japanese may request. According to rice merchants, Vietnam has agreed to ship at least 700,000 tons of rice to Japan, 200,000 tons to France, and 125,000 tons to Shanghai in 1941. In addition to this amount, there may be more than 500,000 tons of surplus rice, which will also be shipped to Japan and paid for in Japanese yen. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Vichy: According to well-informed sources in Vichy, France's response to Japan's proposals regarding the Thai-Vietnamese dispute was submitted to Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka yesterday by Ambassador to Japan Henri. Its wording allows negotiations to continue and suggests hope for a peaceful resolution. It can indeed be regarded as a positive response, but there are still some points that France hopes to negotiate further. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Semi-official Japanese sources say that France's reply to Japan's proposals has been received by the Thai and French representatives for the peace talks. The Thai and French representatives are waiting for instructions from their respective countries to hold the fifth meeting. This meeting is likely to be held tomorrow or the day after, before the expiration of the ceasefire. The ceasefire is set to expire on March 7th. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Bangkok: According to semi-official Japanese sources, Thai officials and the public are maintaining a calm attitude towards the Tokyo peace talks, believing that a good ending can be achieved in the end. According to well-informed observers, whether the meeting will end satisfactorily depends entirely on developments in the next few days. Close attention is being paid to France's actions. Although the talks in Tokyo have avoided a breakdown thanks to France's concessions, it is still too early to say that Thailand and Vietnam can reach a complete compromise, because it is believed that the French representatives in Tokyo have not yet received Vichy's final instructions. According to Japanese sources, well-informed observers said that Thailand's unconditional delegation of mediation rights to Japan shows that Thailand has deep trust in Japan, believing that Japan will do its best to lay the foundation for peace in East Asia. (Reuters Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Matsuoka met the Japanese Emperor at 1:20 PM today to report on recent political developments. Informed sources said that Matsuoka's move was related to reports in the foreign press that Vichy had fully accepted Japan's mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute. At the same time, the Emperor received General Shunroku Hata, the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force to China. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Asahi Shimbun recently predicted a "pleasant conclusion" to the French-Thai peace talks mediated by Japan. The newspaper said that both France and Thailand have accepted Japan's mediation proposals. Future meetings will naturally be more frequent so that they can be concluded quickly. French Ambassador Henri has informed Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka that Vichy has accepted Japan's proposals in principle and has requested Japan to mediate further to make Thailand give further concessions to Vietnam. The newspaper also said that French Ambassador Henri is preparing for a major concession because the ceasefire is about to expire. The newspaper also said that Vichy's response still has flexibility. The final decision will depend on the attitude of French Ambassador Henri and former Vietnamese Governor Robin, the chief French representative here. However, the peace talks, which were about to break down, are now sure to continue. In addition, all newspapers in Tokyo believe that Vichy has accepted Japan's proposals, but has asked Japan to find a way to get Thailand to give Vietnam some concessions.

<h3>Soviet Union Increases Agricultural Production Through Scientific Methods</h3>
<p>Moscow: According to renowned Soviet scientist Timiryazev, the productivity of the land is unlimited, and if we can use scientific methods, harvests can be increased. In terms of major agricultural products, Soviet harvest records rank first in the world. For example, in wheat, Soviet collective farmers, using the latest scientific methods, can harvest 70 to 100 centners per hectare. In corn, they can harvest 125 centners per hectare. In addition, in rye, a female farmer in the Kursk region, Bagaskayeva, harvests 73.6 tons per hectare, a record that has never been seen in history. Corn yields are 120 centners per hectare, equal to the world record. In cotton, the yield on Soviet irrigated land is two to three times higher than that of Egypt and the United States, averaging from 103 to 150 centners per hectare. At the same time, flax yields are 39.06 centners per hectare, and sugar beets are 1.161 centners per hectare, records so high that no country in the world can match them. Soviet farmers have achieved new successes in all areas of agriculture by using scientific methods. (TASS Dispatch, 3rd)</p>

The public and private activities of overseas French people will be subject to strict control. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Germany Can Use at Most 100 Submarines in the War Against British Submarines: New Submarine Construction Figures Are Close to Exaggeration: Paper Plans Are Difficult to Achieve as Scheduled</h3>
<p>London: The Sunday Times naval correspondent said that it is expected that Hitler will use 100 to 120 submarines to launch a new war against British maritime commerce. However, Hitler can only maintain his attacks with one-third of this number of submarines. The figures for the number of new submarines built by German shipyards are too exaggerated. Some say that there are as many as 600, and some say that there are 1,000. This news is being spread by Berlin and is part of a kind of psychological warfare. In fact, this number is a fantasy, without a doubt, because it is five to ten times more submarines than German shipyards can build in twelve months. Submarines cannot be mass-produced. During construction, there is a lot of work that must be done patiently by skilled workers by hand, and the number of skilled workers is limited, and Germany has no evidence of recruiting additional workers from the ravaged countries. In addition, there is the issue of capacity. The number of docks in Germany that can be used to build ships hundreds of feet long is known to everyone. Even with the use of docks in the occupied countries, it is not enough to build 600 new submarines last year. To be generous, Germany may have drawn up a procedure for building 150 new submarines in recent months, but there is a long distance between design on paper and a new ship at sea. During the last war, the German navy ordered submarines, initially believing that all could be built in time, but in the end only half were built. Therefore, it is expected that Hitler will use 100 to 120 submarines that can actually serve to attack British maritime commerce. This number seems quite daunting at first glance, but in fact, it may not all be active at sea. Germany must have a number of submarines for other purposes, such as the Kiel submarine school needing several submarines to train new submariners as one example. At this time, Germany may be actively training 4,000 submariners. If 1,000 of them practice on submarines for one period of time each, then 20 submarines are needed for this purpose. This is not just a guess, because in 1917, when the Great War was in full swing, Germany did allocate 20 submarines for practice. The submarines used by Germany cannot all be sent to sea to fight at all times. According to practical experience, only one-third of all submarines can serve in active service, half are resting, and half are undergoing major repairs, changing every week.

<h3>Eden and Others Arrive in Athens, British and Greek Officials Hold Talks, Turkey Plants Mines in the Dardanelles to Prevent Changes in the Situation in Southeast Europe</h3>
<p>Athens - British Foreign Secretary Eden and British Imperial General Staff Chief General Dill arrived here yesterday after talks in Turkey and went to the British Embassy. British Ambassador Palairet and Greek Prime Minister Koryzis welcomed them at the embassy. Last night, King George of Greece met with Eden. Among those who came to Greece with the two men were British Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff Air Vice-Marshal Peirse, British Army Brigadier Marrape, and several officials from the Foreign Office. They will stay in Greece for several days. Eden told reporters that he was very pleased with his trip to Turkey. The Greek Prime Minister will formally host a banquet for Eden today. (Reuters, March 3rd)</p>
<p>Athens - Eden and his entourage arrived here by plane at 2:45 p.m. yesterday. After meeting with King George II of Greece, they held talks with the Greek Prime Minister. Upon Eden's arrival, the authorities took meticulous steps to protect him. Whirlwind reconnaissance planes circled in the air near and far above Athens, but no enemy aircraft appeared. Eden's plane was closely guarded by fighter planes. (Associated Press, March 3rd)</p>
<p>Athens - The talks between British Foreign Secretary Eden and the Greek authorities began last night and lasted until after midnight. They continued this afternoon. General Dill was present at the meeting. (Reuters, March 3rd)</p>
<p>London - The Times' diplomatic correspondent stated that Germany's threat to Greece has made rapid progress over the weekend. Germany's control of Bulgaria has been completed. If the German leaders do not have a conspiracy to use that country as a base for operations against Greece, they may try new threats, hoping to achieve results through intimidation and trickery. Or they may organize bombing in the future and attempt to cross the border from Bulgaria to the Aegean coast. At this point, it is also clear that British Foreign Secretary Eden and British Imperial General Staff Chief General Dill visited Turkey at the right time. Last Thursday, when the threat to the Aegean Sea was imminent, Britain and Turkey quickly reached a complete compromise on all war issues. Although the details are not yet known, it is clear that this compromise is a new foundation for the cooperation between the allied countries and Greece to develop to the greatest possible extent. (Reuters, March 3rd)</p>
<p>Istanbul - The Turkish Naval Department has notified foreign shipping authorities that all ships wishing to pass through the Dardanelles Strait must notify them in advance and request port instructions for the route, as mines have been laid at the entrance to the strait. In addition, Turkey has adopted standard bread. It is said that the Turkish government has taken this measure due to the uncertain situation in Southeast Europe. (Haitong News Agency, March 3rd)</p>
<p>Istanbul - Turkey began deploying warships on both sides of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits today and has laid mines in various waterways. Turkish warships have removed their gun covers and set sail from Istanbul and other naval bases to patrol the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits. It is reported that German troops have occupied several Bulgarian airfields. It only takes a few minutes to fly from these airfields to the Dardanelles. It is believed that Turkey's move is the result of consultations between British Foreign Secretary Eden and the Turkish authorities. In this meeting, a joint action plan may have been drawn up. (International News Agency, March 3rd)</p>
<p>London - Turkey remains calm about the entry of German troops into Bulgaria. Currently, at least a small team of German troops has arrived in the Bulgarian town of Sidirokastro, a few miles from the Turkish border. Responsible persons said that Turkey has taken complete defensive precautions, but officials remain silent on the issue of mobilization. (Reuters, March 3rd)</p>
<p>Turkish Capital - Diplomatic sources here said that as far as the Axis powers are concerned, Bulgaria's accession to the Tripartite Pact is only a "purely imaginary victory." The main purpose of the Vienna Conference was to counteract the effect of British Foreign Secretary Eden's talks in the Turkish capital. But in any case, it can be asserted that Turkey will maintain its territorial integrity within the scope of the alliance with Britain. (Havas News Agency, February 2nd)</p>
<h3>Bulgarian Prime Minister Attends Parliament</h3>
<p>Bulgarian Capital - Prime Minister Filov attended the Senate and House of Representatives today and gave a speech, stating, "The recent developments in the political situation in Europe and the Balkans have created a situation that we must take into account. We are forced to do so and must take certain decisions to protect the interests of our nation. The government is deeply aware of the great responsibility it bears, and has therefore reviewed the situation and taken various measures to benefit our country, but without making the slightest change to our basic policy of loving peace and abiding by the treaties we have concluded with neighboring countries. What is this decision? It is that our country joins the Tripartite Pact and allows German troops to enter our country. During the negotiations in Vienna, the German government requested our permission to allow German troops to enter our country, while also explaining in detail that this move by the German troops is of a temporary nature and that its motivation is entirely out of a desire to maintain peace in the Balkans. On the contrary, Germany has been fully aware of and has examined our country's treaties with its neighboring countries and the non-aggression pact concluded with Turkey. Under these circumstances, in order to take into account the friendship between Germany and Bulgaria, we decided to accept Germany's proposal and allow its troops to enter our country after obtaining Germany's guarantee to fully respect our country's laws, order, and protect our country's interests. Our government must hereby declare that the entry of German troops into Bulgaria will in no way change our country's peaceful policies. We will continue to adhere to our treaty obligations. Our determination to avoid taking any aggressive actions and to avoid endangering the interests of other countries will be consistent from beginning to end. In short, our government believes that the decision taken at present is not only of great benefit to our country's own interests and future under the current situation, but also makes a great contribution to peace in the Balkans. Our government hopes that this attitude will be understood by those who observe the facts with an objective eye." After Filov finished his speech, eighteen opposition members jointly requested a discussion of the protocol signed when Bulgaria joined the Tripartite Pact. This motion will be discussed by the Senate and House of Representatives. (Havas News Agency, February 2nd)</p>

<h3>British Forces Occupy Important Mountain Passes North of Keren, 1,000 Italian Soldiers Surrender in Libya, Rome Denies Armistice with Greece</h3>
<p>Cairo - British forces have occupied an important mountain pass twenty miles north of Keren. Keren is a strong Italian stronghold in the mountains and is the military key to the British conquest of the entire Eritrean colony. According to a military spokesman who told a Reuters reporter, the British forces won this victory after guerrilla-style fierce battles and occupied this strategically important position. This will have an impact on the offensive on Keren. According to a communiqué issued by the British General Headquarters, a column of British forces advancing from the north occupied this mountain pass. The main force of this column set off from Keremete and made contact with the Italian army in the narrow valley north of Keren on Saturday. The military operations in the entire Italian Somaliland have also made satisfactory progress. However, the British forces advancing towards Gondar in Abyssinia have slowed down due to the rugged terrain.

<h3>Random Notes on the European War (30) (8): On the Eve of the Spring Offensive: A Perspective on Germany's Strength</h3>
<p>Hitler recently gave a speech at the 21st anniversary of the founding of the Nazi Party, in which he said, "I feel stronger now than before, because spring is coming, and this is another time to measure our strength." So, to what extent is Germany's strength at this time? The following is a translation of a report from the Berlin correspondent of the American Christian Science Monitor:</p>
<p>After achieving the greatest military victory on the European continent, Germany, like King Tantalus in Greek mythology, although it has won every battle on the battlefield, still has to prepare for the greatest effort to obtain the fruit of victory that is still swaying uncertainly, within reach but not quite graspable.</p>
<p>Looking back at history, the German army's blitzkrieg-like operations are indeed rare in ancient and modern times, but it is also rare that Germany has repeatedly had its dreams close to realization, but victory is still illusory!</p>
<p>However, the German military authorities and the suffering and submissive people do not allow their beliefs to waver because of doubts about the final victory. Germany has the best-trained army in history, which has never been defeated, and has never been stopped in the astonishing campaigns of the past year. But its final victory still leaves some temptations, which seem to be snatched away at the last moment, seemingly within reach, but ultimately as illusory as a reflection in the water.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the new year, the German army is moving again. They are once again trying to take advantage of the momentum to obtain the reward that Germany and the German people have been expecting for eight years of frugality, hard work, and sweat. Their reward is not easily taken away. Their offensive power, at least in the land and air, is now even greater than before. The weapons they used to attack France last spring have been tempered by experience and victory, plus the enlistment of new recruits and the round-the-clock rush manufacturing of munitions for six or seven months, which has increased their weight.</p>
<p>Wherever this large army advances, it has terrible power and is extremely large. It can attack on several fronts at the same time. It is undoubtedly deployed on the west coast of Europe and can be used to attack the powerful Britain. It apparently has even greater forces moving towards British territories in the Mediterranean. In addition, it has a large number of troops standing by to ensure the security of the German-Soviet friendship treaty. Any military possibility is within the meticulous calculations of the German Supreme Command.</p>
<p>Among these possibilities, German strategists have chosen what they believe is the most suitable place to break British resistance and achieve final victory, so that the Nazi Party can control Europe and Africa and maintain a world hegemony unmatched since the ancient Roman Empire.</p>
<p>However, while 1940 has brought the ancient Germanic dream of conquest closer to realization, it has also revealed the punishment they must suffer if they fail. Before the German offensive was launched last year, the internal affairs of other European countries were strongly attracted by its European new order concept. Even after the German army invaded these countries, there was still a strong movement to accept conquest and cooperate with Germany. However, in recent months, this tolerance has changed to suspicion, fear, resistance, and hatred.</p>
<p>With the advance of the victorious army, a dramatic change has taken place in people and ideas wherever it has passed, and the seeds of resentment have actually been sown.</p>
<p>Germany is almost unprecedentedly isolated today. The sentiment that hopes for its ultimate defeat has spread from the areas under its control to the entire world. If its army once hesitates and retreats, Germany will reap the evil consequences it has sown. The more territory the German army conquers, the greater the need for victory increases. Because Germany knows this, it has to keep moving forward, silencing the steady elements at home, and increasing the voice of the ambitious and boundless elements.</p>
<p>For a year, Germany's military equipment has not been exhausted due to the rapid military victories. The consumption of food and raw materials can be mostly compensated by war booty. The food eaten by the German people today is almost the same as last winter. The German authorities have said that if there is a serious famine, the first to suffer will never be the Germans. However, many changes have taken place within Germany, indicating that if the war is prolonged indefinitely, there will inevitably be concerns about famine.</p>
<p>Germany's ration system is constantly expanding its scope, including more items. Household goods, either necessary for daily life or purchased to prevent inflation, have become increasingly scarce. Price controls have failed to prevent prices from rising, and clothing costs have almost doubled. The prices and quantities of staple foods remain roughly the same as before, but extra foods such as nuts, raisins, chocolate, and fruit are extremely scarce. The average allocation of food was originally the most reasonable goal of rationing, but it has gradually been rejected by various bad habits.</p>
<p>A black market already exists in Germany. Coffee is thirty marks a pound, and tea is forty or fifty marks a pound. If you know where they are sold, you can easily buy them. When it comes to the problem of household supplies, you can often hear the word "contact." There is also a common term, which is "under the counter." People who have regular dealings with shops can secretly receive and give each other to get extra delicacies.</p>
<p>None of the above indicates that Germany is feeling real shortages. People on the street still look healthy and do not show signs of malnutrition. But these small things are enough to make informed people think that things will be different in two or three years. The decline in the standard of living is gradual rather than sudden. It is certainly not easy to see as one month passes after another, but it is declining all year round!</p>
<p>For a year, German morale has been maintained at a high level. In fact, the current morale is higher than at this time last year.</p>
<p>At the end of 1939, apart from the military victory in Poland, there was nothing to show to make the German people believe in the superiority of their army's strength. Since the easy victory over France, all the doubts during the first few months of the war have been swept away. Their record of this victory is greatly comforting to the people. However, along with the issue of morale comes the question of what will happen in the event of a war failure. This fear has also been growing secretly.</p>
<p>As a result of fearing people's hatred, most Germans, regardless of their feelings for National Socialism, support victoryism. As long as they can foresee victory, they can be expected to support the war to the end. Only by destroying their belief in victory will German morale be seriously affected.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, if their expected final victory is severely hit, the magnitude of the reaction can be easily imagined. Morale is built on a combined foundation of expecting victory and fearing failure, rather than on the legitimacy of fundamental belief, and its lack of lasting enthusiasm is already evident.</p>
<p>The gradual emergence of the American threat has gradually made the German people uneasy. This is another factor that is forcing their military policy to tend towards new efforts in order to achieve the dreamed-of victory as soon as possible. But because of news control, the German people still only have a vague image of this threat and cannot know the details of the American trend. Ordinary people only know that American aid to Britain is limited to what is paid for by British money. They still believe that America is completely materialistic.</p>
<p>What can seriously hit German morale is that American aid to Britain is not only for profit. This truth</p>

<h3>Finance: Demand for Foreign Exchange Increases Again</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday saw no change in HSBC's listed prices. In the black market for British and American exchange rates, speculators suddenly tended to buy due to the calming environment and foreign banks' supply was less than demand, the market shrank. The spot transaction price of the US dollar in the morning reached 5.9375 from 5.625, but the market has softened to 5.53125. The demand for March is particularly strong, and the closing price has been announced at 5.5 yuan. The shilling saw minimal shrinkage because very few transactions were opened, and the evening closing was 3/4 of a penny 40625, which compared to last Saturday's closing price, British exchange shrunk 0.015625 and American exchange tightened 0.09375.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks' Demand Exceeds Supply</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, exchange rates were flat for British to US, Shanghai, etc., US to British fell 0.25, and demand for Shanghai was even greater. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened spot selling prices in the morning at 3/4 of a penny 421875 for British gold and 5.59375 yuan for the US dollar. Compared with the closing price at the end of last week, British gold was stable and the US dollar tightened 0.03125. After opening, the US bank sold shillings, and the price was relatively loose and cheap. It is estimated that Huaxing absorbed spot prices at 3/4 of a penny 4375. Later, Hong Kong telegraphed about the March US dollar, and the market was still flat. It is estimated that the foreign bank sold it for 5.59375 yuan. HSBC's listed prices were announced to be unchanged. Thereafter, the Japanese bank wanted to plug in the spot US dollar and sold it to Youli and a certain American bank at a price of 5.625 yuan. Up to this month, the US dollar has seen a slight increase due to the good appetite of foreign banks. Hua merchants and speculators spit out still at 5.59375 yuan. Near noon, there was a gradual feeling that the supply was less than the demand, and the market tended to tighten.</p>
<p>British and American Futures and Spot Prices Tighten Together</p>
<p>In the aftermarket, speculators came to report that demand for the March US dollar increased. It is estimated that foreign banks sold it for 5.5625 to 5.53125 yuan. Subsequently, the potential slightly recovered as Japanese banks and speculators spit it out. The March US dollar was announced at 5.5625 yuan. As a result of the evening closing, the market tightened again. The spot and this month's British exchange rates were both 3/4 of a penny 40625. The spot US dollar was 5.53125 yuan, and this month it was announced at 5.5 yuan. Compared with last Saturday's closing price, British exchange futures and spot prices each shrunk 0.015625, and the US dollar tightened 0.09375.</p>
<h3>Interrupted Bearish News; Gold Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, spot gold dark market and bullish forces were more active, as bearish news in the market was interrupted, and people's hearts were glued. Generally, operators tended to buy in, and the public followed suit. Except for a slight pullback after the morning opening, it rose to 6,300 yuan later. Xianghe, Mian Tong, Kangyong, and Dafeng, among others, bought the most. Retail investors and floating bulls occasionally took profits, so the upward momentum was still slow. Tight foreign exchange was also a major factor encouraging buyers. The closing price in the evening was 6,296 yuan, a large increase of 133 yuan compared to the closing price at the end of last week. The price after closing was 6,302 yuan. The spot market remains strong. The morning opening was 585 yuan higher than the futures market, and 550 yuan higher in the afternoon. Gold ornaments were 10 yuan higher in the afternoon, reaching 700 yuan. Customs gold, etc., remained flat.</p>
<p>Increased by More Than 130 Yuan</p>
<p>In the early morning, people's hearts were firm, and prices outside the market were also high after the close of last week. Sellers held back at the opening, resulting in a price of 6,210 yuan. Before long, Dafeng and another major player sought to increase prices, rising to 6,230 yuan. However, Hengji and Chengji took advantage of the high prices to sell off, and Dafeng and the other major player also successively reduced their positions, causing a retreat to within the 6,200 yuan mark, reporting 6,180 yuan. However, because of the strong buying interest from Tong Kangyong, Xianghe, and Xiangxingyong, and a slight softening of foreign exchange, the underlying trend was upward, hovering around 6,218 yuan. Near noon, the pulling force from retail investors was also strong. Although there was profit-taking by floating bulls, the closing price steadily reported 6,315 yuan. The market opened higher in the afternoon, at 6,230 yuan. It briefly decreased by 5 yuan, to 6,225 yuan. However, Hengji, Hesheng, Xianghe, Chengji, and others jointly purchased, and news of tighter foreign exchange further stimulated buying, first rising to 6,290 yuan. At this time, retail investors and Yifeng were willing to sell, falling back to 6,260 yuan. Ultimately, due to the softening of foreign exchange, and with Deda and the other major player both entering the market, prices were raised again to 6,300 yuan. Extending to the evening close, there was still 6,296 yuan, and after the close, prices outside the market had reached 6,300 yuan, or 6,302 yuan. This was an increase of 133 yuan compared to the closing price at the end of last week. The fluctuation range for the entire day was 120 yuan. The selling price of spot gold from cash houses was more than 10 yuan higher than spot gold, and the purchase price was 30 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no market for spot gold.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Also Increased by 10 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of silver ornaments per tael remained unchanged in the morning. At 3:50 PM, it increased by 10 yuan. Major firms changed their prices to 700 yuan, while new firms offered similar prices. The purchase price was 40 yuan lower, it was said.</p>
<h3>US Dollars to 18 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a sharp rise in spot prices. British and US gold pounds each rose by 3 yuan. British gold notes remained stagnant, with market prices remaining flat. US dollar notes suddenly surged to 18 yuan, an increase of 22 cents compared to the previous day. Demand for Hong Kong notes was not scarce, and the market only saw a slight increase. Japanese gold notes continued to rise to 1.80 yuan. Korean notes slightly softened, falling back to 1.465 yuan in the evening market.</p>
<h3>Grains: Futures and Spot Rice Vanish Entirely</h3>
<p>Since the foreign rice market presented a complete absence the week before, yesterday's opening was even worse. Not only were there no samples for spot goods, but futures also lacked openings. The only item for sale on the market was Hong Kong glutinous rice. However, glutinous rice reserves were insufficient, causing market prices to soar by a huge 2-3 yuan as all parties searched for supplies. Hong Kong special round-grain rice opened at 93 yuan, followed by long-grain rice at 90 yuan. This situation is truly indescribable.</p>
<p>Domestic rice such as thick and thin japonica varieties also saw prices rise due to the poor state of foreign rice. Therefore, regardless of thick or thin japonica, prices continued to increase by 1 yuan. Changbang original white japonica was quoted at 110 yuan, with sales at 111 yuan per hu. Kunshan original white japonica was quoted at 112 yuan, with sales at 108-109 yuan per hu. Qingjiao saw thin rice quoted at 105 yuan, down to 103.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Stockpiling Not Only Rice But Also Foreign Flour</h3>
<p>The foreign flour market continued to see rising prices. Since the tensions in the Pacific increased, all kinds of food have been viewed favorably, and stockpilers have been exceptionally active. Since rice prices have limited room to rise, speculators have focused on stockpiling miscellaneous grains. Among them, the Zhenjiang merchants are the most eager to hoard. Retail investors on this street are also taking the opportunity to raise the prices of flower, bird, and clock tower brand Australian flour. The initial opening of 27 yuan gradually rose to 27.7-27.8 yuan. Jinlong brand was at 26.45 yuan, and Wild Boar and Beauty brands were at 27.9 yuan, all rising by about 1 yuan compared to the end of last week. The price increase is also quite remarkable. However, a ship of foreign wheat ordered by the Fuxin factory has arrived and will soon be processed into flour for supply and sale at lower prices. Moreover, a large batch of foreign flour en route will also arrive soon, at which time there is hope for some easing.</p>
<p>The wheat market is quietly firming up. With the supply from the interior exhausted, a new ship of foreign wheat is being unloaded, and some of the cargo is damp. Amid the rising flour prices, those holding goods are quoting higher prices. Although the Japanese factory is willing to lower prices, there are no spot goods to be collected, and the market presents a stalemate.</p>
<h3>Saigon Rice Sales Market</h3>
<p>— He</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Japan lacks rice. To compensate for this, in addition to scavenging from Chinese producing areas, Saigon is also a major supply region. According to investigations, the production of rice in Japan from 1939 to 1940 was already in serious shortage, and the production from 1940 to 1941 decreased by another 15%. The shortage of rice in Japan this year is approximately 1.5 million tons. Vietnam was forced to supply a large amount of rice in exchange for Japan's surplus textiles. In February alone, Japan dispatched no less than seven specialized ships to Saigon to transport rice.</p>
<p>The export volume of Vietnamese rice accounts for 45% of the total exports, with an annual value of US$41 million. Due to the strong demand from all parties, the export volume in 1939 totaled 1,692,000 tons, an increase of 15% last year. Since the fall of France, Europe no longer receives supplies of Vietnamese rice. Those who have replaced it include China (especially Shanghai), as well as India, the Philippines, and British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. Governments of various countries, aware of the urgency of the war situation, are pre-purchasing large quantities of rice to prepare for any eventuality.</p>
<p>In 1938, Japan imported very little rice from Saigon. By 1939 and 1940, the number increased greatly. According to Japanese estimates, the export volume of Vietnamese rice this year will be 1.5 million tons, of which 700,000 tons will be imported into Japan, and the remainder will be imported into India, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, and China. In 1939, Vietnam imported a total of 21,500 tons of rice into Shanghai. Last year, this increased to 269,000 tons. This year, the number of imports is expected to be similar to last year. In January of this year, Shanghai imported more than 50,000 tons of rice, four-fifths of which came from Saigon. The following table compares the general situation of rice imports into Shanghai in January of this year with the same period in the previous two years.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Oil Cakes and Miscellaneous Grains All Soar</h3>
<p>The market for miscellaneous grains and oil cakes is soaring in the face of increasingly tense world war conditions. Speculators are smiling from ear to ear. Soybeans rose by 2 yuan, with over 5,000 bags traded. See the market price column for details. Corn rose by 3 yuan, with 3,000 bags of spot goods and 300 tons of futures traded. Soybean oil rose by 4-5 yuan, with 100 lots, 100 dan, 500 barrels, and 2,300-2,400 barrels of futures traded. Peanut oil also rose by several yuan, with 150 lots and 800 cans sold. Bean cake jumped by 30 cents. Other red grains and the like also rose sharply by 80 cents to 1 yuan. However, before shells have started to fly, it is unclear whether various goods will be constrained. Speculators are blindly following, unaware of whether their wishes will be fulfilled. Today, 1,400 bags of corn are being shipped to Yantai, 120 bags of peanuts, and 600 bags of beans are being shipped to Xiamen. Also, 300 bags of sesame, 10,080 pieces of bean cake, and 800 bags of beans are being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Speculation Active; Cotton Yarn Rebounds; "Double Horse" Rises Above 400 Yuan; Guangdong Merchants Exclusively Sell March Futures</h3>
<p>The yarn market has turned firm, and a rising trend has begun. This is because rumors in the market have subsided, while foreign exchange has contracted and benchmark gold has risen, causing speculators to become active again. As for the Hong Kong merchants, their need for scattered purchases is still active, so people's hearts are good, and the market has risen. The high price for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn in the morning was 1,392 yuan, and the low price was 1,365 yuan. The initial price in the afternoon was 1,384 yuan, followed by 1,402 yuan, and the final price was 1,399 yuan. Guangdong merchants sold about 500-600 bales of March futures. Today, 625 pieces of cotton yarn are being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The morning opening for "Double Horse" was stable and quiet, with the initial price at 1,365 yuan. After this opening, buyers were very active, gradually rising to 1,392 yuan. Then, because those taking profits sold, the form was slightly weak, falling to 1,377 yuan, but the closing slightly rebounded, to 1,380 yuan. According to half-day transaction statistics, 7,380 bales were traded. The amount purchased by each merchant is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 560</p>
<p>Inland 10</p>
<p>Ningbo 10</p>
<p>Fellow Merchants 6,800</p>
<p>Total 7,380</p>
<p>The spot cotton situation remains dull, because yarn factories are not operating smoothly and there is a lack of sales for spot yarn.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market was active and firm due to purchases by fellow traders and good cotton cloth trade. As a result, closing prices rose by 2-3 pounds compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Indian cotton is still scarce in large-scale trade, and the market rose slightly with speculative purchases. Yesterday, the forecast also rose by more than one rupee.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton trade remains quiet. At a time when the electricity problem has not been resolved and yarn factories are finding it increasingly difficult to operate, all parties certainly have no ability to develop.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Suddenly Tightens</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market opened flat yesterday morning and rose firmly in the afternoon. This was because the exchange rate tightened and sentiment turned bullish. Fellow traders and dyeing factories continued to absorb goods at lower prices. Because the electricity problem at the factories has not been resolved, it is rare to offer futures, and the supply of goods is tight. Selling prices for fine cloth and twill rose by 25-50 cents per bolt, and coarse cloth rose by about 25 cents. Dapeng Fugui fine cloth was sold at 43.25 yuan in the morning and rose to 43.75 yuan in the afternoon. Over 500 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street. Sales to customers were lackluster. Merchants from the Zhejiang route (Wenzhou and Ningbo) purchased over 100 pieces of colored cloth and coarse and fine cloth. Merchants from the Fujian and Guangdong areas purchased over 200 pieces of blue cloth, colored drill, and poplin. Merchants from the northern route (Yantai and Tianjin) purchased over 100 pieces of colored cloth, serge, and poplin. On the 4th, 75 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Xiamen and 1,960 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: A rising trend has gathered again. White fine cloth and fine twill continue to rise in price because of consistent actual sales and stockpilers' buying. Prices soared by more than 1 yuan per bolt. Twelve-pound Flying Fish fine cloth opened high in the afternoon market at 49.5 yuan. Dragon Head fine cloth has new and old stack orders, leaving buyers helpless, and the rising momentum is also slow. The closing price for new orders was only 48.5 yuan. Four Gentlemen Serge was at 1.28 yuan in the morning market, and later jumped to 1.325 yuan due to absorption by speculative retail investors.</p>
<h3>Woolens and Serges in Prime Spring Sales Season</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the woolens and serges market was good, with brisk retail and wholesale transactions. Merchants from Xiamen sent numerous woolens and serges packages by mail, and the number of ships sailing to Zhejiang increased again. Woolens and serges being transshipped from Ningbo to Jinhua, Jiangxi, Guiyang, Hengyang, Chongqing, and Chengdu increased greatly. On this street, Western suit shops on Avenue Joffre, Dasing Street, Szechuen Road, and Chengan Temple Road, woolens and silk brocade shops on Chessboard Street and Nanking Road, clothing shops on Siccawei Road, and used goods shops on Woosung Road all saw strong buying for various spring season goods. Because it is the prime spring sales season, demand is increasing frequently, and the outbound flow is active, leading to increased trading. In addition to spring goods, even goods for the summer, autumn, and winter seasons are being picked up, so business is becoming more prosperous.</p>
<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Hover and Gain Momentum</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter market for government bonds was very quiet and stable yesterday. Market prices hovered in the range of 20-30 cents. Xinfu's buying has not stopped, but because sellers are scarce and buying is also low, all parties are watching and the market is unusually dull. Shunchang and Xinfu bought in the morning, and Xincheng and Runde sold. Most parties stood on the sidelines, and transactions were no more than 100,000-200,000 yuan before noon. Market prices rose and fell by only 5-10 cents. In the afternoon, Xinfu continued to buy, and Renfeng suddenly bought in 200,000-300,000. However, Lianhe and Jiufeng continued to supply, and market prices continued to weaken by 5-10 cents. As a result, Class D and 96 did not open, and although Class E did not rise or fall, the others rose and fell slightly by 10-30 cents. Transactions were only over 700,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stocks: Easy transactions. The Commercial Press traded 50 shares at a price of 89 yuan.</p>
<p>Public Shares: The stock market opened stable, then gradually softened. Although there were small rebounds, it was ultimately unable to maintain a firm trend due to the large number of sellers. Trading volume was not high throughout the day.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar Both Rebound Well</h3>
<p>The sugar market resumed its firm trend yesterday. Both raw and refined white sugar rebounded well. The association quoted 24 raw white in the spot market, initially at 79.7 yuan, then rising to 79.8-79.9 yuan. Delivery orders for March 10 were at 80-80.1 yuan, and delivery orders for March 20 were at 80.3 yuan. Dutch raw sugar rose from 61.4 yuan and then strengthened, rising to 62 yuan and 62.5 yuan, up 70 cents. Taikoo refined white B mark was at 80.5-81 yuan, Dongzhan was at 80.8 yuan, DY mark was at 79 yuan, and HX mark was at 78.2 yuan. 360 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>
<h3>Coal: Power Company Purchases Coal; Indian Coal Even More Scarce</h3>
<p>The business of bituminous coal has recently seen the power company search for a large quantity, reaching more than 30,000 tons, from fellow traders, resulting in a sudden shortage of spot goods on the market. Stockpilers are also holding out for high prices, and market prices are rising sharply, suddenly increasing by over ten yuan. The rising trend of May last year is reappearing. Indian bituminous coal is being quoted at 255 yuan to 260 yuan at most. Other secondary goods are also rising in unison, it is said.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Price of Small Gardenia Rises</h3>
<p>After the initial rise in the price of small gardenia in the first market, there has been no further opening. Existing stocks are still not thick. According to a letter from the Rongfang district, the number of this year's outputs is not large, so processing prices are tight, and the recent market has risen by another 20 yuan, so market quotations are also high, it is said.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Tangerine Peel Jam Market Firm and Active</h3>
<p>Tangerine Peel Jam: Production prices are high, there has been a lack of arrivals, and market stocks have been exhausted. The outbound sales channel will be moving, and market prices are expected to rise. Shenxia should be close, and the companies have already sent letters urging shipment. Arrivals may be soon, it is said.</p>
<h3>Economic Miscellany: Review of the Inflow of Diamonds into China</h3>
<p>— Feng Liutang</p>
<p>Since the publication of the article on diamonds, I have received a letter from Mr. Zhang Jingle (January 9), which reads:</p>
<p>"Recalling the spring of the 29th year, I, considering that the measuring instruments used by diamond dealers are all imported products, thought of imitating several kinds in order to reduce losses. So I made two kinds of diamond measuring pliers and balances, and compiled a book of diamond measurement comparison tables, with a short record of diamond knowledge to increase readers' interest. I welcome criticism and supplementation. Unexpectedly, years have passed, and no one in this industry has taught me a single word. I also know that my writing is short and clumsy, and I have not been able to attract jade! Now, reading your macro article, I have benefited a lot. However, I would like to know when and by whom diamonds were first imported into China, and in what year and in what way Carat (the not widely used world metric system) was changed to 200 milligrams and two points. I am emboldened to ask, and I enclose a copy of the diamond measurement comparison table, hoping for your corrections."</p>
<p>In addition to expressing my gratitude to Mr. Zhang for his generous gift, I have recently read history and discovered one of the points that Mr. Zhang wants to ask in his first question. I am taking advantage of today's holiday to answer Mr. Zhang and inform readers:</p>
<p>The term "diamond" is found in the History of the Ming Dynasty, as mentioned in the previous article. As for when and by whom they were imported into China, it is not easy to find in Chinese history books and notes. Chinese literati are skilled at poetry and articles, but things that involve some physics are regarded as craftsmanship, trivial skills, not worth mentioning, let alone recording. The creation of Economic Miscellany is deliberately trying to put effort into this kind of place, so it often costs a lot and achieves little. The completion of an article does not take much effort, but the effort spent on weekdays is not small. Therefore, for the beginning of things, there is only one way to infer from the words and sentences. This is also the only way to do it when there is no other way.</p>
<p>China's communication with foreign countries gradually flourished after the Six Dynasties, but most of them were taken from the land route. Although the sea route was , it was not prosperous. Even the Mongols' attack on Europe and Asia was from land. The benefits of navigation became apparent when Zheng He went to the South Seas seven times during the reign of Emperor Chengzu of the Ming Dynasty. Starting from the first voyage in the third year of Yongle (1405 AD) and ending in the fifth year of Xuande (1430 AD), he made a voyage to more than 30 countries and took countless unnamed treasures. In these four words of "unnamed treasures," it is not known how much of the goods from the South Seas and Western Europe were included in the flow of people into China. Not only that, but at that time, tropical animals were offered as tributes to the Ming court, such as Bengal frequently offering unicorns, and countries such as Lumei offering lions and rhinos, which are not uncommon. Unicorns, according to the Ming History, are indeed giraffes produced in Africa today. Lions and rhinos go without saying! By the time of Emperor Zhengde of the Ming Dynasty, the Portuguese had already come to Guangdong. At that time, Western goods were seen in poems, such as Wu Kuan's poem thanking Western Regions glasses. The reporter had questioned the scope of the words "Western Regions" in the glasses test, and now there is also evidence that the existing glasses in the Western Regions are not necessarily from Malacca.</p>
<p>As for the period when pearls, jade, and gems flowed into China from foreign countries, the most prosperous period was during the reign of Emperor Shizong of the Ming Dynasty. (Jiajing 1st year - 45th year, 1522 AD - 1566 AD) After the middle of the Ming Dynasty, Emperor Shizong was very fond of Taoist techniques, building fasting and sacrifices, collecting wood, collecting sandalwood, and collecting pearls, jade, and gems, so that officials and people were busy. He used more than 300,000 catties of yellow and white wax, more than 100,000 catties of aloeswood, frankincense, and lacquer, and also purchased ambergris in separate ways, which was not obtained for more than ten years, so he asked foreign ships to enter Macau, which was the beginning of the Portuguese occupation of Macau. He also used red and yellow jade to make Fangze dynasty altars and vessels, which he bought from the borders of Shaanxi and could not get (that is, bought from Western Region merchants), and sent envoys to Atan, two thousand miles southwest of Turpan, to seek them. He used the silver from the Taicang treasury and used people to transport it, handling gold, treasure, and pearls. As a result, cat's eye stones, grandmother's stone, edges of Saxony stone, red thorn stone, Beihe wash stone, and sweet yellow jade were all purchased. Emperor Muzong inherited it, and the purchase of jewels was even more urgent. Emperor Shenzong was greedy, and the price of jewels increased twenty times as much as before. The magistrate of Shuntian Prefecture was punished for buying large beads of crow green for trade, which shows the emperor's eagerness to search for jewels, and the inflow of foreign jewels must be high.</p>
<p>From this, it can be known that there was diamond input in the middle of Shizong, and the mediator of the input was undoubtedly the Portuguese, because the Portuguese had already settled in Macau at that time.</p>
<p>As for when the weight of each carat was changed to 200 milligrams, Mr. Zhang and I are currently both aware of this, but we do not know why. We will introduce it to readers when it is discovered in the future. Fortunately, learning has no end. One person's mind and talent are not used here, but they are used there. What I do not know, others may know. To supplement what is known with what is not known is also the way to learn from each other.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheng Kezhong raised doubts and asked about the method of calculating the price of diamonds according to the size of the carat, but I am not in the industry after all, and I have no way to answer. I am taking this opportunity to ask those who run diamond businesses to give details, which should be disclosed, and I think it will also be welcomed by readers, not just Mr. Sheng.</p>
<p>Regarding diamond weighing methods, the refractive index of diamonds, and the evolution of diamonds, I am introducing Mr. Zhang Jingxuan's "Diamond Measurement Comparison Book" to readers, which can be checked here.</p>

<h3>The City's Fuel Problem: There is Currently No Shortage; Electricity Supply Takes Step-by-Step Reduction; Coal Supply is Continuous and Uninterrupted; The City's Industrial Circle Does Not Overemphasize This Matter</h3>
<p>The entire fuel problem in Shanghai is highly valued by all parties. According to investigations, the amount of coal in stock in the city is approximately 150,000 tons, which cannot be said to be small. The committee organized by the Public Works Department to study the electricity supply problem is scheduled to continue its meeting today to discuss the electricity supply problem, and is scheduled to submit a proposal at the Public Works Department's board meeting tomorrow. According to news from authoritative sources, the committee plans to submit the following recommendations: (1) The plan proposed by the Shanghai Electric Power Company to reduce the electricity supply should be implemented gradually, so that the city's industry will not suffer adversely, and the requester itself will not suffer any losses. (2) The Public Works Department should assist the Shanghai Electric Power Company in obtaining ships to transport coal and oil. At the same time, Chinese factories here are now trying to cope with the new situation after the Public Works Department approves the Shanghai Electric Power Company's plan to reduce the electricity supply.</p>
<p>Considering Shortening Working Hours: Yesterday (March 3) morning, after the news that the Shanghai Electric Power Company only had a three-month supply of coal spread, Chinese manufacturers in the city have considered the steps to be taken when the electricity supply is lacking. Now that the City Chamber of Commerce has closed, and the electricity supply may be reduced in the short term, some factories are now considering shortening working hours. At present, most Chinese factories operate day and night, consuming 60% of the total electricity supplied by the Shanghai Electric Power Company.</p>
<p>Some Factories Do Not Emphasize</p>
<p>Also, some Chinese factories have stated that they do not overemphasize this matter, because some factories have already been forced to close due to a lack of raw materials. They deny that coal reserves have decreased, claiming that more coal was imported last month than in the same period last year. In addition, a large batch of coal is on its way to Shanghai, and maritime personnel in the city have not been ordered to stop transporting goods, so the ship problem is not particularly serious.</p>
<p>Coal Sources Increasing Rather Than Decreasing</p>
<p>In recent days, foreign coal sources have been increasing rather than decreasing. However, rumors are rampant in the market, saying that the situation in the Pacific is becoming increasingly tense and coal sources will be interrupted, or that coal transportation costs are soaring and costs are increasing. However, according to inquiries, orders for shipment to Shanghai are still continuously en route. Yesterday, the Mora wheel loaded 2,700 tons of Hongji white coal and No. 1 small coal from Annam, which has been unloaded onto the stack. The coal is managed by Yitaixing and Nanyang Coal Ball Company. However, all sectors are eager for the two companies to sell the coal immediately and supply it to the market in the short term.</p>
<p>Quantity Shipped to Shanghai in January is Considerable</p>
<p>The quantity of coal shipped to Shanghai in January of this year has been calculated by the Jianghai Customs. The following is a record, totaling 118,319 metric tons, with a value of 950,247 gold units, equivalent to 2,572,319 yuan in national currency. Among them, Japan accounted for the most, with 45,009 metric tons, followed by British India, with 29,165 metric tons, third by Taiwan, with 18,322 metric tons, fourth by Korea, with 14,941 metric tons, and fifth by Annam, with 11,000 metric tons. Re-exports totaled 210 metric tons, so coal from cheap sources was the most abundant in January.</p>
<p>Machine Oil Sold Out; New Goods Have Not Arrived</p>
<p>It was learned yesterday that the machine oil of a certain American oil company here has been used up, and the machine oil currently stored by other oil companies is also low, so there is a shortage of machine oil in Shanghai. It is said that the above-mentioned American oil company had no machine oil to supply to the shop owners yesterday morning, and the reason given was that the inventory had been sold out, and new goods would not arrive in Shanghai until the end of the month. Other oil companies sold a limited amount of machine oil yesterday (March 3), but were unwilling to negotiate large-volume sales transactions, and were only prepared to deliver a small amount of machine oil.</p>
<p>Gasoline Reserves are Still Sufficient</p>
<p>At the same time, some merchants and individuals in the city, fearing that gasoline would also be in short supply soon, added to their purchases yesterday. It was heard that most of those who added to their purchases of gasoline and machine oil yesterday were car and truck rental companies. However, according to calls from gasoline companies in the city, there is currently a sufficient amount of gasoline available, and there will be no shortage for several months. The theory that gasoline will be in short supply is likely to be spread by speculators who intend to hoard gasoline and make profits.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Arrives in Shanghai Today Aboard the Yushēng Steamer</h3>
<p>Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, departed Chongqing by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane on February 25th, stopped in Hong Kong for three days, and was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai by steamer on the first of this month. According to information obtained yesterday from the British Embassy in China, the Ambassador and his party are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today aboard the Yushēng steamer of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. There have been rumors that Sir Archibald Clark Kerr will travel to Singapore, but the embassy cannot confirm this.</p>
<h3>French Municipal Council Adjusts Economic Contributions and Taxes</h3>
<p>In order to adjust economic contributions and tax issues, the French Municipal Council has recently re-established the Economic and Tax Adjustment Committee. The list of committee members, as suggested by the chairman of the board of directors, are as follows: J. Donne, Ed Egle, R. Pontet, Zu Xingrang (the above four are all directors of the board), D. A. Sadoo (Chairman of the French Chamber of Commerce), and D. Martionli (Chief Engineer and Manager of the Qiúxīn Factory), totaling six people. They will conduct research and reforms on various issues related to the administrative economy and taxes of the concession.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Donations to the New Public Nursery</h3>
<p>The New Public Nursery continued to receive enthusiastic donations from all sectors yesterday, and also received many monthly donations. A summary is as follows: Lù Gēng, 1000 yuan; an anonymous person from Songjiang, 100 yuan; Tóng Jūnmíng, 50 yuan; Chén Hǎilíng, 20 yuan; Huá Shēn Dá, 12 yuan; Zhèng Huái, 5 yuan; Chén Wénxǐng, 3 yuan.

The nursery expresses its gratitude on behalf of the orphaned and destitute children. The locations for collecting donated clothing are: Catholic Church, Tiānzhǔtáng Street, Rue Yangtszepoo, French Concession. Donation collection points are: (1) Silk Industry Bank Trust, 460 Hankou Road; (2) Banque Belge pour l'Etranger, Sassoon House, The Bund; (3) Jìhuá Táng, 47 Yun Road; (4) Huáměi Pharmacy, 356 Fuzhou Road; (5) Catholic Church, Tiānzhǔtáng Street, Rue Yangtszepoo.</p>
<h3>American Red Cross Relief Rice and Wheat Soon to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The third batch of rice and wheat from the American Red Cross for Chinese disaster relief is on its way to Shanghai. According to a reporter from the Ping Ming News Agency who interviewed the China branch of the American Red Cross in Shanghai yesterday, the association received a telegram from the American Red Cross stating that the third batch of rice and wheat donated to Chinese disaster victims includes 80,000 bags of American wheat and 8,000 bags of rice, which are already en route to Shanghai. The 8,000 bags of rice are being transported by the American President Lines' President Pierce, which is expected to arrive on the 8th of this month. The 80,000 bags of American wheat are being transported by the American President Lines' President Cleveland, which is sailing to Shanghai for the first time and is expected to arrive on the 9th of this month. The association is currently discussing the distribution plan for these relief rice and wheat. It is also learned that Dr. Baker flew from Chongqing to Hong Kong last month to plan relief efforts and will soon fly back to Chongqing, with no plans to stop in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Rice Merchants Anxious About People's Food Supply, Requesting Daily Supply of 10,000 Bags, Black Market Prices Rampant, Exceeding Limits Further and Further, Wholesale and Retail Sales Insufficient, Causing Panic</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Merchants Association sent a letter to the authorities of the two concessions yesterday, stating: "To Whom It May Concern, Since the soaring rice prices have affected the people's food supply, although foreign sources are smooth and inventories are thick, outbound volume is also robust. However, the market transactions have been misled by rumors for the past ten days. Those with goods are reluctant to sell, resulting in a situation of having a market but no goods. It is rumored that black market transactions are rampant,</p>
<p>especially today,</p>
<p>exceeding the limits further and further. According to the set price limits, there is actually no goods to buy. Our fellow rice merchants engage in wholesale and retail sales, supplying the entire city's food supply, purchasing at any time to meet market needs. Once there is a shortage of goods for sale, it will inevitably cause panic among the people. Our fellow rice merchants are in this environment, wanting to abide by the price limits but having no goods to buy. If we want to meet wholesale needs and purchase exceeding the limits, the sacrifice is too great. Currently, the inventories of each rice merchant</p>
<p>are about to be exhausted.</p>
<p>If this continues without remedy, not only will the people's food supply be in danger and difficult to relieve, but the local public order will also be greatly affected. Therefore, we are writing to humbly request your authorities to consider the importance of the people's livelihood and promptly order those holding goods to supply the market with 10,000 bags of rice daily to meet the people's food needs and avoid causing panic. This is our earnest prayer."</p>
<h3>Japanese Sentries in Western Shanghai Open Fire, Killing a Peddler, More Than One Hundred Arrested Are Sent to Hongkou for Imprisonment</h3>
<p>At about 6:00 AM yesterday, more than ten impoverished male and female peddlers from the Hongqiao Town area of Western Shanghai each purchased dozens of kilograms of domestic rice and smuggled it into the concession through the barbed wire, hoping to earn a meager profit. When they reached the barbed wire entrance in front of Shiziwan, east of the Xujiahui Railway Station in Western Shanghai, they were suddenly spotted by Japanese sentries pre-positioned there, who opened fire. One male peddler from Jiangbei, aged about 30, was killed on the spot, and two male and female were injured. The rest scattered and fled. Recently, prices of all goods have been expensive, and the general public cannot maintain their livelihood. Therefore, villagers from the suburbs of Caohejing, Meilong, Hongqiao, and Qibao in Western Shanghai have formed groups to purchase daily necessities such as cigarettes, cloth, sugar, and oil in Xujiahui, transporting them to the inland areas to make a living. However, the above-mentioned goods are all controlled by the Japanese side and are not allowed to be transported to the inland areas. The general impoverished peddlers then smuggle goods through the barbed wire near the Tushanwan area, hoping to get lucky. Recently, this was discovered by the Japanese side. Over the past two days, more than 200 people have been arrested, mostly women and children, and transported to Hongkou for imprisonment in freight trucks.</p>
<h3>If Japan Audaciously Advances South, It Will Inevitably Suffer a Cruel Retaliation, Britain and the United States Have Completed Arrangements and Will Act in a Timely Manner, Economic Blockade and Military Action Proceeding in Tandem</h3>
<p>As Japan continues to aggressively pursue its southward advance, the situation in the Far East is deteriorating daily. Britain and the United States, with their traditional and significant interests in the South Sea Islands and their military bases such as Singapore and Manila forming strategic cornerstones, will naturally not allow Japan to advance southward unchallenged. Therefore, they are also actively preparing for retaliation and have plans to jointly implement an economic blockade to sanction Japan. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency, believing that the Anglo-American economic blockade is closely related to the overall situation, visited a foreign observer in Shanghai yesterday to inquire about the possible developments of the Anglo-American economic blockade and Japan's staying power. The observer first stated that Japan's economic strength is outwardly strong but inwardly weak. If Britain and the United States start an economic blockade and China can also take the opportunity to counterattack, then Japan will be defeated within a year. Currently, Britain and the United States have completed their arrangements. If Japan disregards everything and decides to advance southward, it will inevitably suffer a cold retaliation, and its future is worrying and predictable.</p>
<p>Total Blockade of Japanese Trade</p>
<p>From the current situation, it is possible that commercial relations between Britain and the United States and Japan will be severed. If Japan does not stop its military adventures in China and its southward policy, Washington will cut off all commercial ties with it. Britain will definitely agree with this blockade policy and take unified action with the United States, and British and American territories will also respond one after another. In the end, in a war, Britain and the United States would swiftly and unexpectedly blockade the trade between third countries and Japan, which would be a severe blow to the Japanese economy. Although the Japanese military has been making every effort to store military materials such as coal, oil, steel, and iron in the country and in "Manchukuo" in recent years, the Japanese economy will not collapse within a few months due to the Anglo-American blockade. However, this move can at least cause Japan's stored military supplies to decrease day by day and eventually run out. According to accurate estimates, Japan's stockpile, if only decreasing and not increasing, can maintain the current production standards of the military industry for nine to twelve months. In other words, the collapse of the Japanese economy will happen at most a year later, at which time the lack of military raw materials will make it unsustainable and fall into a desperate situation.</p>
<p>Major Raw Materials Rely on Britain and the United States</p>
<p>In the three years of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has relied heavily on Britain and the United States for trade. Most of the iron, steel, tin, manganese, aluminum, tungsten, nickel, rubber, petroleum, cotton, wool, wood fiber (paper-making raw materials), leather, leather products, hemp, soda, and chemical fertilizers are supplied by Britain and the United States. The combined trade between Britain and the United States with Japan accounts for three-quarters of Japan's trade with non-Yen bloc countries. In Japan, imports from Britain and the United States account for 75 percent. Japanese exports to Britain and the United States account for 70 percent. The largest amount of imports comes from the United States, Hawaii, and the Philippines, totaling 552 million yen, equivalent to 48 percent of non-Yen bloc exports to Japan. These statistics show that if the United States implements a full-scale economic blockade against Japan, it will lose half of its imports. Last year, Japan imported goods from Britain worth 625 million yen. If Britain refuses to supply these goods to Japan, then Japan will lose another 28 percent of its imports. With British and American naval bases in Panama, the Falkland Islands, and Singapore, Japan loses 20 percent of its imports. Therefore, when the Pacific War breaks out, Japan will lose 95 percent of its imports from non-Yen bloc countries.</p>
<p>Unimaginable If War Breaks Out</p>
<p>As for exports, last year Japan's trade with non-Yen bloc countries was 1,834 million yen, of which 1,300 million yen were sold to Britain and the United States. Therefore, if Britain and the United States implement a joint blockade, Japan's exports will be reduced by 75 percent. Also, most of Japan's merchant ships operate within the sphere of influence of Britain and the United States. Therefore, once war breaks out, Japan will not be able to continue trading with non-Yen bloc countries. If Britain and the United States terminate commercial relations with Japan, of course both sides will suffer pain, but the pain suffered by Britain and the United States will be much less than that suffered by Japan. Japan only accounts for 5 percent of British and American export commerce. Therefore, the damage suffered by Britain and the United States is negligible, especially since it has no relationship with British and American defense. On the other hand, Japan is completely different. Once war breaks out, it will lose three-quarters of its normal commerce and lose raw materials, machinery, aviation fuel, and cotton and wool textiles. These items cannot be obtained from elsewhere and cannot be produced in Japan proper or in the occupied territories. It can only rely on stored materials, and when they are all used up, it will inevitably suffer a severe panic due to the lack of materials.</p>
<p>Anglo-American Policy is Different Now Than in the Past</p>
<p>At a time when the British and American economic blockade is highly likely, Japan is at a crossroads, whether to surrender to Britain and the United States or to go to war with Britain and the United States. In fact, Japan is unwilling to compromise with Britain and the United States, and going to war with Britain will encounter an economic crisis. What Japan is currently seeking is for Germany to quickly defeat Britain and the United States in the European war, so that Japan can drive Britain and the United States out of the Far East in one fell swoop. However, it is still vague when this "good opportunity" will arrive, and the stockpiled materials will continue to decrease with repeated delays. This is the diplomatic dilemma of Japan today, and its current tough attitude toward Britain and the United States is actually a bluff, nothing more than wanting to use deceptive means to induce Britain and the United States to make concessions and achieve its ambition of southward advance. However, today's Britain and the United States are far from the Britain and the United States of the past. Their attitude is firm and their position is unswerving. If Japan audaciously advances southward, military retaliation and economic blockade can defeat Japan within a year. Conversely, because Britain and the United States have adopted a firm stance in the Far East, it is enough to create a good international situation for China, making every effort to enrich China's capacity and economic reserves, and deepen Japan's quagmire in China. At that time, Japan will be attacked by the three countries of Britain, the United States, and China. The situation in the Far East will be cleared up, and China will appear in a completely new posture. The acquisition of the final victory is a guarantee for China's long-term future.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Tax Collection in Western Shanghai, Rumored to Be Resolved Soon, Both Sides Engage in Discussions on Specific Details, "Special Police" May Be Established Within the Next Week</h3>
<p>The Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun reported that after the resolution of the "Special Police" issue in Western Shanghai, concerning the issue of minor taxes in the area, the "Municipal Government" and the Shanghai Municipal Council have reached a consensus through an agreement with a "spirit of mutual concession." Recently, the "Finance Bureau" investigated past tax revenues and is about to conclude. Both sides can then discuss specific details based on mutual opinions. Because the fundamental opinions of both sides have already reached a consensus, all other items can be easily resolved, and the issue of road construction beyond the boundary in Western Shanghai can be fully resolved.</p>
<p>Personnel Selection Continues</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that police officials stated this morning (the 2nd) that the joint Western Shanghai Special Police Force is expected to begin operations before the 15th of this month. Some junior police officers of the Special Police Force have already been appointed, but the selection of all personnel is still in progress and is expected to be completed within a few days. According to today's Japanese newspaper report, "Mayor" Chen Gongbo issued strict orders on Saturday and Sunday to Pan Da, the Director of the Shanghai West Special Police Station, to fully implement the regulations prohibiting smoking and gambling. The Special Police Force will soon be established, and its preparations are now complete.</p>
<h3>President Pierce Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai on the 7th</h3>
<p>The American President Lines' President Pierce departed from Los Angeles on January 30th, heading east via San Francisco (without stopping in Honolulu) directly to Yokohama and Kobe, on the way to Hong Kong, Little Luzon. It has now returned from Little Luzon and is scheduled to pass through Hong Kong and come to Shanghai tomorrow. It is expected to arrive at the port at 6:35 PM on the 7th, mooring at Floating Pontoon No. 12 and 13. Passengers will switch to a small ferry to land at the Customs Wharf around 7:30 PM. It is heard that the length of time the vessel stops in Shanghai this time will be slightly longer than in the past, about 38 hours. It is scheduled to leave Shanghai at 8:30 AM on the 9th for Kobe and Yokohama, and return to Los Angeles via Honolulu and San Francisco. The last passenger ferry will depart from the Customs Wharf at 7:00 AM on the 9th. It is heard that a portion of American expatriates will be returning home on this vessel, most of whom are evacuees from the interior. Only a small number of American expatriates from this city will be returning to the United States on this vessel.</p>
<h3>The Anniversary of the Death of the Founding Father Approaches, All Sectors Suspend Entertainment, Continue to Promote the Thrift and Savings Movement</h3>

<h3>American Methodist Missionaries in China Are Not Yet Prepared to Retreat, Discussions Have Taken Place But No Final Decision Has Been Made, Seventeen People in Tokyo Have Returned Home</h3>
<p>A senior official of the American Methodist Episcopal Church said to reporters the day before yesterday (the 2nd) that the news reported in Tokyo that the church had decided to withdraw its missionaries in North China and Central China was premature. The issue of withdrawing missionaries from the two regions has been discussed for some time, but this matter requires further study, so no final decision has been reached.</p>
<p>Missionaries in Japan Have No Right to Decide. A Tokyo dispatch from the Domei News Agency stated that missionaries of the American Methodist Episcopal Church in Japan held a meeting and resolved to withdraw all missionaries in Japan, Korea, North China, and Central China. In fact, the missionaries in Japan have no jurisdiction over missionaries in China and therefore have no right to decide on the withdrawal of missionaries in China.</p>
<p>The Methodist Episcopal Church Missionary Area. A Domei News Agency dispatch stated that missionaries of the American Methodist Episcopal Church in Japan gathered and discussed for five hours, resolving to withdraw because they could not obtain funding from the United States. Seventeen missionaries have already boarded the President Coolidge to leave Japan for the United States. According to reports, the Methodist Episcopal Church is engaged in missionary work in the Chinese provinces of Anhui, Hubei, Jiangsu, Gansu, Shandong, and Sichuan. There are two bishops, one Bishop Grose in Fujian, and one Bishop Wade in Chengdu, Sichuan.</p>

<p>Death Caused by Accidental Discharge of Shotgun</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that La Fon, a French police captain of the Foch Road Police Station in the French Concession, went hunting in the Hongqiao district yesterday (the 2nd). Upon returning, he accidentally discharged his shotgun and was fatally wounded. According to the French Police Department, La Fon went hunting with three friends in the outer district of the French Concession of Bi Lian in Western Shanghai at about 8:00 AM yesterday morning. After finishing, when getting into the car to return, he accidentally discharged the shotgun. A bullet flew out and struck him in the chest. He was rushed to Guangci Hospital but died on the way.

He was 36 years old and left behind a wife and two children.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Selling Cheap Goods at High Prices for Soap, Matches, etc.</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Road Tobacco Exchange Association's trading market is where large and small businesses affiliated with the association participate in buying and selling. The various items bought and sold are mostly necessities for the citizens, such as soap, matches, toilet paper, and various tobaccos. However, since the outbreak of the incident, some businesses have taken the opportunity to hoard existing goods, resulting in market prices rising step by step. The association has resolved that all businesses participating in the market must pay 300 yuan in national currency and deposit it with the association to increase credibility. Otherwise, they will be refused entry to the market, and the sale of cheap goods at high prices is strictly prohibited.</p>
<h3>Interest on Construction and Military Bonds Can Be Entrusted to the Bank of China for Collection</h3>

Payments will be made in full by the Central Bank starting on the 31st of this month. The Central Bank Shanghai Branch will not handle these interest payments, but can be entrusted to the Chongqing branch of the bank to collect the payments.</p>
<h3>The Highest Philosophy Common to the Five Religions</h3>
<p>Mr. Yang Zhongyi of the Rong Wu Discourse Society recently spoke on the highest philosophy common to the five religions, saying: "Establishing a sect as religious doctrine is called religion, hence the division of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam. Although the tenets differ, the principles they explain are the same, and although the names and appearances differ, the essence is the same. The five religions each have their own essence, but there are common and interconnected points. The highest philosophical principle is the theory of 'One in Three Persons,' which is known to be the doctrine of Christianity. It should also be known as one of the highest philosophies shared by the five religions. I will briefly cite the teachings of each religion to prove this."</p>
<p>1. Islam: "Al-Tawhid not three," "One in three meanings" in the Hidden Meaning of the Heavenly Method of Nature and Reason. "One Truth evolves" in the Hidden Meaning, that is, the Way of Conduct tracing back to its origin, "The Truth arises as One, the Number One becomes Evolution, the Essence One evolves and evolves," which clearly states the meaning of One in Three Persons.</p>
<p>2. Christianity: The Gospel of Matthew, the First Epistle of John, already contain the meaning of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit being One in Three Persons. In the Gospel of John, chapter 10, Jesus said, "You all are God." In the First Epistle to the Corinthians, chapter 3, Paul said, "You are the temple of God, and God dwells in you." In Colossians chapter 1, Paul said, "This mystery is Christ in your hearts," which is the same meaning as Jesus said, "I and the Father are one." The Holy Trinity states, "Absolutely speaking, God is one; relatively speaking, God is three persons." "To the Father belongs power, to the Son belongs knowledge, to the Spirit belongs goodness." The Father is the original body, the Son is like a clear mirror, and the Spirit is the radiance it emits. Theologians say: "God has a threefold manifestation in different visions," so God is in this person, and also fully in the other person at the same time, which is one and three. It is not to say that God has three persons and the same essence, so it is said that God is one."</p>
<p>3. Buddhism: "The Mind, the Buddha, and sentient beings are three without difference" in the Verse-Speaking Chapter of the Bodhisattvas in the Yama Heaven Palace of the Sixty Hua-yan Sutra. "The True Mind of sentient beings is the body of all Buddhas, without difference" in the Commentary on the Awakening of Faith. "All Buddhas and Tathagatas are the Dharma Realm Body, entering into the minds of all sentient beings. It is the mind that makes a Buddha, it is the mind that is a Buddha" in the Sutra of Contemplation on the Immeasurable Life Buddha. The Three Mysteries of Tiantai, the Three Equal Precepts of Esoteric Buddhism, the "Three Treasures as One Body" of Huineng, and the "Three Bodies as One Body" of Zen Buddhism all fuse the manifested and hidden, provisional and real aspects of the Dharma, Reward, and Response. In the Secret Treasury Record, "The Mind itself is Reality, Reality itself is the Honored One, the Honored One itself is the Mind." The cause and effect are not two, and the knower and known are one, so it is said that "the three are without difference." In the Six Explanations of the Six Kinds of Kinship in the Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra, "Sentient beings are thus, the Buddha is thus, the One Thus is without two thus." "To allow movement is the Son," "The Father of the World-Honored One, the Honored One among all Sages," "This is my son." The "Compassionate Father" and "Buddha Son" of Buddhism can be imprinted with the One in Three Persons.</p>
<p>4. Taoism: "One Qi transforms into the Three Pure Ones" is the most common tenet of Taoism. In the fourteenth chapter of the Tao Te Ching, "These three cannot be interrogated, kneaded into one," it also speaks of the meaning of three in one. Chapter 42, "The Tao gives birth to One, One gives birth to Two, Two gives birth to Three, Three gives birth to all things." Taoists regard the Tao as their doctrine, so they regard the Tao as the essence. The One, Two, and Three that are produced are the Spirit because of One, the Transformation because of Two, and the Way of Heaven, Earth, and Man because of Three. Zhang Zai's One Spirit Two Transformations is the same Origin with Different Names of Lao Tzu, and the Great Ultimate that gives birth to the Two Forms of Confucius. The Beginning of Qian and the Birth of Kun are called the Father and Mother. Therefore, Chapters 21 and 42 speak of the "Father," Chapters 1 and 20 speak of the "Mother," Chapter 4 speaks of the "Son," and Chapter 25, "There is a thing formed chaotically," "call it the Fourth Tao," which corresponds to the theory of One in Three Persons.</p>
<p>5. Confucianism: Liu Xin's Three Unifications Calendar and the Treatise on Pitch-Pipes and Calendrical Astronomy in the Book of Han both say, "The Great Ultimate Original Qi contains Three as One." The Yiwei Qianzaodu, "The Yi begins and ends as One, divides into Two, is capable of Three," Zheng Xuan annotated, "The Great Ultimate contains Three as One, living together in parallel." Therefore, the River Diagram Dynasty Record says, "Take One as the Great Ultimate." Yang Jian of Cihu has changed the Yi, "One is my One, unspeakable, unknowable," "Three is the form, One is the essence." That which cannot be spoken or named is the hidden essence of the Tao. One Yin and One Yang is the manifestation of the Tao as an image, and continuing goodness and fulfilling the essence is the expression of the Tao as a function. The Tao is not far from man and originates from the Great, its essence is not two, so its production is unfathomable, and the unfathomable is called Spirit. Mencius said, "All people can become wise." "The sage is the one who first obtains the same feeling in my heart," so Yangming said, "The streets are full of sages," and Buddhists say, "All sentient beings possess Buddha-nature." How can their sayings be different?</p>

In addition, a register of withdrawn students should be added for verification. As for the academic credentials of each student, the school must still preserve them until the end of the semester for dispatching personnel for review. Each school that has not yet approved the academic records of the upper semester is ordered to reply first before reporting the single volumes of this semester, otherwise the academic records of this semester will not be reviewed. Each type of register can still be purchased directly from Zhengzhong Bookstore, but the register of withdrawn students must be prepared by themselves. In addition to publishing in the newspapers, no separate documents will be issued in this case. The items to be listed in the register of withdrawn students are listed below:</p>
<p>Items to be Listed in the Register of Withdrawn Students: 1. Name, 2. Gender, 3. Age, 4. Native Place, 5. Department, 6. Grade in which they studied last semester, 7. Promoted or Retained, 8. Reason for Withdrawal, 9. Transfer Certificate Number, 10. Remarks.</p>

<h3>Western Union Football Enters Final Stage; Tung Wah to Play Portugal This Week; Shi Cup Final, St. Francis to Play North China Children on Saturday at 2:30 PM at Recreation Ground</h3>
<p>The Western Union Football League has now entered its final stage. The champions of four of the five major cups have been produced, including the International Cup (Portugal), the Sietz Cup (Russian Army Team), the Reserve Cup (Tung Wah), and the Junior Cup (Vittolino). Only the final of the Scott Cup remains, scheduled to be held at the Racecourse on the weekend (9th) at 2:30 PM. The opponents are St. Francis and North China Children. The latter has been gaining momentum recently, and strong teams such as French Commerce and Western Police have surrendered to them. However, St. Francis is much stronger than North China Children, so they are expected to win the championship. This match has been allowed by the Race Club to set up a grandstand. All those with complimentary tickets, staff cards, and Western Union green passes can enter the venue, but no tickets will be sold. After the match, Captain Lee Te will be specially invited to present the awards. As for the league, it has also reached a critical juncture. In Saturday's Group A match, Tung Wah will meet Portugal at Recreation Ground, with the match starting at 2:30 PM. Since Kwok Wah drew with North China Children, and Western Police defeated Rox, Tung Wah is now one point behind Western Police in Group A.

<h3>Western Writers Win Championship; Army Union Suffers a Miserable 5-1 Defeat</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Dispatch) In the final of the Lihua Cup Football Tournament, the Chinese team was full of regrets and lost the right to the final. The number of Chinese spectators was only half a hundred, and the atmosphere on the field was bleak. Western Writers and Army Union competed for the Lihua Cup. Army Commander-in-Chief Jia Naixi came to the field to receive the award. During the 90-minute process, Western Writers had the advantage, and the front line was active. Hou Lv and Fu La scored five goals. Army Union's Huo Shi and Wei Ya recovered two goals, 5 to 2. No one expected Western Writers to win. Army Union bowed their heads in submission. But in three-quarters of the entire game, the soldiers took the initiative. Although the clerks sought to leave under pressure, they immediately attacked the key parts of the army in retaliation, which made the military union angry. There were very few wonderful scenes in the battle. The two sides lined up as follows:</p>
<p>Western Writers Team</p>

<h3>Fee Reduction</h3>
<p>— Rong Yao</p>
<p>One Thursday afternoon, a letter arrived at home. I opened it and saw only a few words:</p>
<p>"Regarding the tuition fee for the semester, after much effort and enduring countless rebuffs, I finally managed to borrow fifty dollars. It has been sent by mail. Father."</p>
<p>After reading the letter, I felt an extreme sadness in my heart. At the same time, the endless worries that the tuition for the next semester had increased from fifty to seventy dollars welled up in my heart.</p>
<p>The entire night, I was trapped in a city of sorrow, calculating how to obtain the missing twenty dollars.</p>
<p>From the letter from home, I could see how difficult the family's situation was. If I wrote another letter asking for money, it would only increase the suffering of my frail old father, and there would be no hope at all. As for borrowing, a stranger in a strange land with no relatives or friends, on this isolated island shrouded in the groans of the poor, trying to borrow money would truly be a dream.</p>
<p>After thinking all night, I finally decided to request a fee reduction from the school.</p>
<p>The next day, I retrieved the money from the post office and, full of hope, eagerly headed towards the school.</p>
<p>A huge recruitment advertisement at the school entrance caught my eye from afar, especially the red bold words "Our school has many fee reduction and free tuition places," which were particularly eye-catching. I couldn't help but feel fortunate for myself and quickened my pace, stepping into the school gate.</p>
<p>Inside a large office, it was already "water couldn't leak through" with people who came to pay tuition fee. Sure enough, business was booming. The principal sitting at the payment counter was so delighted that his fat face was smiling so much his eyes disappeared. It was with difficulty that I squeezed through the crowd and walked towards the principal at the payment counter.</p>
<p>"Ah! Are you here to pay the fee? Please sit, please sit!" He greeted me with a smiling face.</p>
<p>"Yes, Principal. However, I would like to request a reduction in tuition fee, is that possible?" I replied respectfully.</p>
<p>"What, a fee reduction? Oh! I'm really sorry, our school doesn't have such a rule." He coldly lowered his head to count the banknotes on the table, and I felt greatly disappointed.</p>
<p>However, with a frown, I thought of the large fee reduction words on the advertisement outside the school gate. Always clumsy, I suddenly had a flash of inspiration and decided to use "the spear of the son to attack the shield of the son."</p>
<p>"Huh! Then doesn't the advertisement outside the school gate clearly state that fee reductions are possible?" I said with confidence.</p>
<p>"Well, this..." He was clearly caught off guard by my move.</p>
<p>The fire of hope rekindled in my heart, and I continued to plead without hesitation, "Principal, please help me considering my grades!" I took out the report card from my pocket. "Although, I also know that the school's funding is depleted. If it weren't for you, Principal, doing your best to maintain it, would it even be able to continue operating? I am also doing this because I am forced to." I even put a high hat on him, flattering him.</p>
<p>"Yes, think about it, the school's monthly expenses are so huge. Just the school building alone costs thousands of dollars a month. Recently, the teachers have also been clamoring for a raise. We don't receive subsidies from the Ministry of Education either. Isn't that making things difficult for people?" He complained at length, then picked up my report card and took a look, continuing, "Let's do this. Seeing as your grades are not bad, I'll reduce your fee by ten dollars."</p>
<p>"Sir, can you reduce it by another ten dollars?" Like a customer haggling in a store, I asked again.</p>
<p>"Well, no. This is already the biggest concession. If I reduce it any more, are you telling us to drink the northwest wind? If you're still not satisfied, then you can transfer to another school, but other schools don't accept graduating classes. Haha." He smiled sinisterly and walked towards the registration office.</p>
<p>Alas, it's over. After talking for so long, only ten dollars was reduced. What use is that? Helpless, I hung my head and set off on the way home. Upon arriving, I collapsed and fell asleep.</p>
<p>The first day, seeing that there was really no other way, I hardened my heart, took off my coat, tucked it under my arm, and went to the street. Like a thief, I sneaked into the gate of a pawnshop, closed my eyes, threw the coat upwards, and said, "Fifteen dollars." Fifteen dollars and a contemptuous sneer were thrown down from the high counter. I fled the pawnshop in fear. A northwest wind cutting my face blew my whole body, making me tremble like a leaf. I gritted my teeth, braced against the cold wind, and ran to school at lightning speed.</p>
<p>Stepping into the office, I walked towards the fat principal sitting at the payment desk, smoking a cigarette. Passing the roaring stove, I couldn't help but stand there for a while.</p>
<p>"Are you here to pay the fee?" He still had that smiling face.</p>
<p>"Yes," I handed over the thick stack of tuition fees.</p>
<p>"Huh! Why is there only sixty dollars?" Truly, important people are "forgetful".</p>
<p>"You promised yesterday, a ten-dollar fee reduction."</p>
<p>"Oh, you're a fee reduction student."</p>
<p>His throat was twice as loud, but his eyes were shooting towards the students and parents standing at the registration office, as if afraid they wouldn't hear him. Then he stuffed the banknotes into his leather bag full of banknotes and picked up his pen to write a receipt.</p>
<p>"Please pay a two-dollar handling fee."</p>
<p>"What handling fee, sir?"</p>
<p>"Fee reduction handling fee."</p>
<p>I was stunned.</p>
<p>"Hurry up, this is the school's rule." He said fiercely.</p>
<p>Helpless, I had to pull out the five dollars I had prepared to buy books.</p>
<p>"Here are two dollars in change." The receipt and the banknotes were thrown over together.</p>
<p>"Huh! Why did you only give me two dollars in change?" Looking at the banknotes in my hand, I asked in surprise.</p>
<p>"Well, that's right, because the deadline for paying fees was yesterday. You're one day late today, so there's a one-dollar fine. This is the school's rule." Saying that, he picked up the half-smoked cigar from the table and started smoking with a smile on his face again.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but gasp and cursed inwardly, "What a cunning scoundrel."</p>
<p>Stepping out of the back door, I saw the huge advertisement fluttering in the wind, especially the red bold words, which seemed to emit a strange light, "flattering" the pedestrians.</p>
<p>I sighed deeply and felt in my pocket for the "sole remaining" two dollars and a pawn ticket.</p>
<p>Alas! What books can I buy with this?</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Thoughts</p>
<h3>Difference of a Few Minutes at Birth</h3>
<p>— Ren Jiong</p>
<p>People are the same, but there is a difference of a few minutes at birth.</p>
<p>Indeed, this saying seems to be something we are already tired of hearing. However, very few people pay attention to the poison and mysteries in this sentence. Even a surprising number of fools still take it as "golden words" and use it as the only method of self-consolation, which is truly unjust and wrong!</p>
<p>I am not exaggerating. If you don't believe me, just look at every corner of society, where people holding this kind of thought are everywhere. Whether it is housewives, factory workers, or people living in very painful situations, especially widows, nuns, monks, etc., when they feel pain, they curse their fate. The fortune teller says I have a "laborious life," so I have been a beast of burden my whole life, and it is all attributed to the two words "bitter fate," and they never think of turning over. They never even dream of saying that this has a reason. As for what the reason is, they feel even more confused and vague, but it is just a "difference of a few minutes at birth" from rich people!</p>
<p>Therefore, those rulers who specialize in devising ways to make people follow their commands are satisfied. These fools who are willing to obey and accept it have actually fallen into the trap of these guys who enjoy themselves at the expense of others. Thus, these few people can exploit others generation after generation, and the majority of people are attributed to bitter fate and are forever chewed on. This has formed today's society.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must point out that fate is fabricated from the mouths of the blind (people who cannot see things), that it is today's society that makes you suffer, and that it has nothing to do with those fabricated fates. Please don't be deceived any longer and be forever crushed and unable to breathe. It is just like the death of those widows' husbands. The death of the husband has a reason for its death, and it also has little to do with so-called fate.</p>
<p>Please, friends who believe in fate, wake up! Move the time you spend cursing fate and resenting fate, and the pain that is being chewed on in your heart, to the goal of working hard and creating a new society. Although life is still painful today, the amount of pain has a big difference, and the heart is happy instead. At that time, the real world will definitely tell you what fate is all about! Let's all experience it firsthand!</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(IV) Unexpected Encounter</p>
<p>Just at this time, the waiter had brought the noodles and pot stickers. Zhao Si was no longer polite with Begonia, picked up a pair of bamboo chopsticks, and used them with more skill than anything else. In a few moments, only an empty bowl and an empty plate were left on the table.</p>
<p>Zhao Si went out swaggering with a full stomach. Begonia then called Rongkui, selected a lined gown and a twenty-dollar bill, and instructed him to send it to Zhao Yukun. This is where Rongkui's cleverness was revealed. He bought a bottle of Wu Jiapi wine and some dried beef worth a few cents on his own initiative and sent them over. Zhao Yukun was happier than anything else when he received them, and Rongkui himself easily earned more than ten dollars.</p>
<p>When he returned to the Tianjin Hotel, full of pride, Begonia and Ma Jinshou and a group of people were being surrounded in the room by many of Shen Mazi's apprentices, who were using various threats to make them return the advance payment they had received.</p>
<p>When Rongkui saw that the situation was not right, he hid in his room and dared not go up again. Fortunately, Begonia had stayed in this hotel every time he came to Tianjin to perform, and the manager got along well with him and had some influence on the ground, so he did his best to mediate and decided to talk again the next day before sending the group of people away.</p>
<p>"It's okay to return the advance payment, but they have to release our costumes first!" Begonia was not a person without any ideas, so he said this to the manager of the hotel.</p>
<p>"Of course, that's right," the manager groaned, "but if someone hurts Shen Mazi, it will be much more difficult to talk!"</p>
<p>Mentioning this point, Begonia was really at a loss, and the rest of the people certainly couldn't think of any good ideas.</p>
<p>Zhao Si didn't come back until after dinner. (Four five)</p>

<h3>Most Popular Songs in the Midst of the European War</h3>
<p>— Shu Jia</p>
<p>Many songs often become popular with wars. The most popular song in this European war is "Beer Barrel Polka". When Canadian troops landed in England, when Australian and New Zealand troops were fighting in the Middle Eastern theater, and when British troops were assisting in France last year, they all sang this light tune as a substitute for marches; even in British air-raid shelters during surprise attacks, people were singing it. This song has sold one million copies of sheet music and is still going strong.</p>
<p>The second best-selling song in the United States is "South of The Border", which is also very popular in England. This song was co-written by the famous British writer and composer Connerty and Carl, and it sold about 500,000 copies of sheet music. The next is "Wish Me Luck as You Wave Me Good-bye," which has sold 450,000 copies of sheet music to date; British actress Grace Fields often sings this song to comfort the British armed forces, which is deeply loved by the soldiers.</p>
<p>The fourth best-selling song is Carl's solo work, "Somewhere in France," with 400,000 copies of sheet music sold. Since the British army withdrew from Dunkirk, this song has gradually been heard less often.</p>
<p>The above four songs are the most popular songs in this European war, but the number of sheet music sold is far less than that of British popular songs during the last World War. For example, the famous song "It's a Long, Long Way to Tipperary" during World War I sold 5 million copies of sheet music, "Roses of Picardy" sold 3 million copies, and "Keep the Home Fire Burning" also sold more than 1 million copies.</p>
<p>Publishers say that the decline in sales of popular song sheet music is due to the development of radio; now, once a song becomes popular, it is repeatedly broadcast on the radio. After about thirteen weeks, people get tired of hearing it, and the "life" of that song gradually comes to an end. But during the World War, the average lifespan of each popular song was about two years.</p>
<p>Songs symbolizing the hope of people all over the world for future happiness also have a very wide sale. A publisher asked the famous composer Irving Berlin to write a song to express this idea, and he wrote "It's a Lovely Day Tomorrow" accordingly, which sold 100,000 copies. Other songs with high sales include "It's a Hap Hap Happy Day" and "We'll Go Smiling Along".</p>
<p>Among the songs with current affairs themes in this European war, "Hang Out the Washing on the Siegfried Line" was the most popular for a while, selling 350,000 copies of sheet music. Publishers admit that the sales of this song have declined recently because the war on the Western Front in Europe has ended, but when British troops one day land in Europe and launch a large-scale land war, this song will definitely become popular again.</p>
<p>In addition, British people often suffer from air raids at night and have to take shelter in air-raid shelters, so there is a "good night" song that is often on their lips. The lyrics of this song are very simple, with the general meaning being, "Please don't think it's impolite of me to yawn, I have to get up tomorrow morning, good night, good night, did you bring the lamp, yes; did you bring the gas mask, yes, very good, good night, good night."</p>

<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>After hearing this, the young man carefully looked at the big man and saw a tall black horse tied under the weeping willow at the entrance. He then opened his mouth and replied, "Where are you from, strong man? It's almost noon now, and my humble abode is about to serve lunch. It's possible for me to offer the strong man a meal, please come in and sit down, what do you think?" The big man said, "Thank you, thank you." He immediately turned around and took a package from the horse, following the young man to where he was studying. The windows were bright and the table was clean, with no dust or noise. The bookshelves were filled with many books. The young man asked the big man to sit down. The big man threw the package aside, took off his hat from behind, and sat down on a chair by the window. The young man shouted into the room, "Liu San, come quickly, there's a guest here." Then a man in the appearance of a hired worker came to serve. The young man said, "Quickly bring a pot of tea, is the stove water boiling?" Liu San agreed and retreated. After a while, he brought a pot of tea and two teacups, pouring two cups of tea. The big man hurriedly drank his cup in one gulp, shouting, "It's not enough to quench my thirst. I won't be polite, please forgive my rudeness." He then took the teapot, put it to his mouth, and drank the entire pot of tea in one breath, saying, "Bring another pot. I want to drink it whether it's cold or hot. But this tea is too hot, it would be better if it were cold." The young man then told Liu San to scoop out a large bowl of spring water from the jar. Liu San agreed and brought a large bowl of clear spring water to the big man. The young man said, "Since you like to drink cold water, strong man, this is clear spring water taken from the mountain. I dare to offer it to you as a guest." The big man nodded and said, "Good." He held the bowl in one hand and drank the entire bowl of water. He laughed loudly, "Are you laughing at me for drinking like a cow?" Liu San took the empty bowl. The young man told him to add some rice and dishes. That guest would be having lunch here. Liu San agreed and left. The big man then said to the young man, "You're really good, you're good enough to be a friend. Didn't you ask me where I came from just now? I'll be honest with you. My surname is Zhang, and my name is Cangqiu, and I am from Nanyang. Since I was young, I was taught by an extraordinary person and learned some martial arts. It's just that my father was framed by an enemy, and my family was confiscated. Fortunately, I escaped with my life. Afterwards, I took advantage of a gap and killed my enemy with my own hands, avenging the irreconcilable hatred. But I have no home to go to, and the country is difficult to surrender to. I passed by Jigong Mountain alone. It happened that a group of bandits came down from the mountain to rob me, not letting me pass. They offended my anger, so I used my skills and killed many of them, breaking into the mountain stronghold. The bandits saw that I was highly skilled and were willing to surrender, pushing me to be the leader. I had nowhere else to go for a while, haha! I became king on that mountain." (Two)</p>
