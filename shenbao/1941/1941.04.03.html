<h3>八中全會　蔣總裁訓詞全文</h3>
<p>重慶　（續昨）現在一般輿論、對於我國目前經濟問題、不覺有許多抱着過分的憂慮的、依本席的觀察、我國的經濟上實在幷沒有什麼可憂慮的地方、現在有人批評我們、譏笑我們、認本黨工作不緊張、太懈怠、甚至說我們是腐敗了、衰老了、這種種批評、我們都要承認，都要接受、從今天起、我們就要</p>
<p>澈底反省</p>
<p>以期補過圖功、對於任何事業、都要拿出我們革命的精神來、克服一切困難、以求日新又新、能够不斷進步、如此急起直追、我相信要解決目前經濟的危機、實在幷非難事、各位要知道、我們此决全體會議、正當建國工作眞正開始的時期、我們實在有繼往開來、領導建國的責任、如果我們不能樹立起建國的精神、不能鼓舞全黨同志和全國同胞一致從事於建國工作的奮鬥、那我們過去三年多的犧牲努力、眞是要前功盡棄、但是我們觀察過去三年八個月以來、允其最近半年之間、我們奮鬥的精神、確是一天不如一天、從黨到政府、從我們中央到地方、無論黨務政治國家經濟各種事業都沒有新的精神、缺乏新經濟力、我以為這一點就是絕大的危機、這個責任、我們不能推之於政府、又不能推之於民衆、允不可歸之於內外環境的險惡、應歸之於領導抗建的本黨、允其是今天在座各位中委同志、我們應該念念不忘「革命尙未成功」的一句遺敎、如果我們今天在座的百十餘位同志、大家都能一致振奮、仍舊像過去三年以前一樣、來發揚我們凌厲無窮的氣慨、最後</p>
<p>講到黨務</p>
<p>和政府、這是我們革命的根本所在、各位都要知道、目前根本問題、是耍使政治有新氣象、黨務有新的精神、我們今後要完成建國必須從全新政治、但耍政治走上規道就必先求本黨的健全、因此本席今天特別就黨務方面、對各位同志簡單的說幾句話、我們對於現在國際環境和國內情况、以及本黨的立塲、都要有一個明白的認識、、要知道本黨在中國的地位、與別的國家已有相當基礎的執政黨、像德國的國社黨、義大利的法西斯黨、以及蘇聯的共產黨、都不相同、我們現在還在革命時期、我們一般黨員、人人都要作最基本、最實際的奮鬥、允其耍從基層工作、社會工作上來努力、我們現在不怕本黨的政權不能强固、亦不怕中國政治不能健全、而只怕我們的黨和社會隔離、以致我們的政治小能確立普遍而深人的基礎、我們</p>
<p>作了賞、少數是作了中央委員、當然是為了担負革命天職而來、不是為高官厚祿、或要求個人的權位而來、不僅是為此、我們做中央委員的同志、必須時時要聽取民意、所以我們更要服務社會、來盡瘁職責、眞正能與民衆打成一片、因無論那一個委員、如果在政治上或社會上能够到最基層的事業中去努力、到最接近民衆的地方去服務、方是我們致力革命最正當的途徑、才不愧為眞正的革命黨員、如果我們黨的基礎還沒有鞏固、黨的信仰還沒確立、而一般同志就以為我們應該有特殊的地位、應該享特殊的權利、這就是完全錯誤、要知道革命還未成功、主義還未實現、我們的恥辱未雪、職責木盡、今後要振奮全國人心、其責任全在於本黨、全在於我們一般中央委員、要樹立黨的基礎、其責任亦全在本黨各級幹部、亦全在我們一般中央委員、我們一切革命事業的進行計劃和努力途徑、總理在全部遺敎中、已給我們詳細的指示和安排好了、只要我們認淸自己</p>
<p>職責所在</p>
<p>遵照遺敎、切實努力、那我們對於社會一切服務、即是多盡一切黨員的實任、為本黨多樹立一切社會的基礎、只要我們絕不憚艱苦深入社會、接近民衆、使本黨在社會上的基礎日趨穩固、則我們革命建國的大業、就可以迅速成功、因此、我們全會對於本黨黨員參加地方政治、與社會服務工作的方針、應該有一個切實的決議、要使此次</p>
<p>會議之後</p>
<p>我們黨的組織、黨的精神、以及黨紀、黨德都能進步充實、積極提高、有一番新的改革、以造成新的氣象、纔能眞正負擔我們革命建國的責任、以上所說、不過是幾點簡單的提示、而實在是我們革命成敗最切要的關鍵所在、希望各位同志、在此决全會期中、專心致志、盡量硏討，來完成本屆全會所負繼任開來的使命、（一日電）</p>

<h3>公共租界董事名額問題</h3>
<p>公共租界工部局董事會之選舉問題，擾攘匝月，前晚始經工部局總辦費利溥氏發表聲明，謂此問題經英美日三國領事與公共租界「最大利益方面」進行談判；業已同意向領團各領事及中國政府建議，變更原有董事名額，在一定時期內，改為中國四人，英國與美日各三人，德方一人，其他國家二人。此一變更，不惟打破十年來君子協定之成例，亦與洋涇浜地皮章程關於董事名額之規定相出入，其將如何影響此後租界行政前途，自為數百萬居民與夫各關係國家所共同矚目。</p>
<p>變更局董名額之議，肇自一九三六年，倡議者則為日方，然數載以來，迄未獲遂。去春提出候選人名單時，日方率自變更往例，自二人增至五人，同時並竭力從事競選，曾演出非常緊張之一慕；乃投票結果，終以最大多數選民之公共意志所在，得維持五二二原有名額分配於小變；當時日僑方面，即有加緊準備以待來年之語。及至今歲，表面競選，初不緊張。而幕後接洽，久聞頻繁；馴至名單既遲遲未提，選期復一再展緩，乃於環境杌隉之中，轉增市民以微妙之感。據前晚披露談判之結果，董事名額全盤變動，除總數已由十四增為十八，國籍之分配則華减其一，英减其二，而日力增加董事一人之願已予滿足；同時，美董亦增一人，並另增德籍及他籍者共三人。據聞折衝經過已近一月，始獲此結果。是可想像當事者之頗費周章，而費氏之委婉聲明。允足見其苦心孤詣之一斑。以目前時機而論，上海租界行政機構之不宜輕事更張，即在費氏亦所不予諱言；而此一變更較之「舉行選舉已有發生爭端與糾紛之可能」者，孰利孰害？且變更而後，是吾即獲如費氏所言，足以成立一種「較為安適之氣氛」，並使若干「迫切之重要問題易於處置」？此則盡人之所不能不加以最大保留者也。</p>
<p>未來局勢之可慮，不僅在於局董名額比例之變更，而在於法理藩籬一經盪抉，此後更難免招致更多的覬覦與困擾。日方所爭，表面上雖僅為名額，其用意實在於行政權與管理權之控制，而局董人數之增加適為此一控制企圖之第一步階梯。租界前途之如何演變，固猶有視於此後種種因素之如何開展，不能驟認局董名額之變更，對於租界有何決定的作用；然非有特殊辦法以防制此後種種進一步之醖釀，則租界現狀之保持將倍增繁難。即就工部局董事會之本身言之，經過此一變更之後，亦復將有若干新的問題踵之而興：以目前外董名額分酊比例而言，英美共六人而日本三德國一，與已往英美七而日本二相較，比數消長，意義微妙，此其一，其他國籍二人，初未規定其誰屬，然日方必將竭力活動，俾得此二人助力極可能的因此而形成與英美相抗衡之局；據傳前此曾發表所謂「改革上海計畫」且為某案主角之瑞僑惠特勒，已成為日方所屬目之對象，此其二。華董五人，今减為四，其能吾獲得中國政府同意猶屬重大疑問，而此更少之華董位置殆將形成更重要之目標，華董自身處境亦將日增艱困，此其三。總董一席，關係重大，除其本身種種職權而外，依照規定，凡遇議事時，凡贊吾雙方人數適相等，則將取決於總董之一票；今茲英美董席僅等於華董以外之董事總和之半，此總董一席之向背實足以左右董事會之動向，此其四。</p>
<p>如何安定上海，殆為此間中外數百萬居民之共同耍求，而此次局董名額之變更，實與最大多數居民之意志及保持上海原狀之要求相違反，且亦有背於中國及英美當局不容改變上海現狀之一貫政策，無論就法理言，就事實言，均不能不認為重大遺憾。今有關各國對此固將作如何之考盧與決定，是大可注意也。</p>

<p>延安探投毛參政員澤東並轉陳紹禹·秦邦憲·林祖涵·吳玉章·董必武·鄧穎超·諸先生公鑒、溯自民國二十六年貴黨發表宣言、擁護政府、合力禦侮以還、全國人民、莫不深寄同情、刮目相看、此無他、放棄一黨一階層之私爭、願為民族解放、盡力奮鬥、要之以且旦信誓、見諸於實事求是、實獲民心、有以致之也、</p>
<p>背棄諾言　破壞抗建</p>
<p>不區作戰四年、曙光在望、正宜一心一德、再接再厲、爭取最後勝利之會、先生等忽因政府解散新四軍一舉、遽於本屆參政會集會時期、預提所謂善後辦法、暨臨時解決辦法等足以動搖國本之苛刻條件、資為出席與吾之要挾工具、此就貴煎立塲言、則為背棄諾言、以大局言、實乃破壞抗建、今日何日、豈容再起閱牆之爭、先生等此舉、寗不使仇者稱快、親者痛心乎、</p>
<p>襲擊友軍　濫擴部隊</p>
<p>竊按新四軍年來在蘇皖等省、時聞襲擊友軍、不見作戰、濫擴部隊、無非誅求民食、侵奪防區、純為拓展地盤、而猶曰此係民主政治、竭宣傳之能事、一若國人之目盡盲耳盡聵、不難從而盡欺者然、殊不知綜其叛國亂紀之行動、大江南北人民、十手所指、十目所視、固不僅耳熟能詳巳也、</p>
<p>分裂團結　乘危作亂</p>
<p>政府為整飭軍紀、加强作戰陣容計、加以制裁、在該軍堪稱咎有應得、在國人猶憾失之過緩、先生等豈得以黨同之私、罔辦黑白、曲予袒庇哉、、須知天視自我民視、天聽自我民聽、是非曲直、其明如鏡、當斯千鈞一髮、存亡絕續之秋、任何黨派、皆為國人所擁護、反之、怯於作戰、勇於私鬥、分裂團結、乘危作亂、假作戰之名、行倒戈之實、以攫奪政權為目的者、其軍雖鋼、皆為民族之罪人、蠢國之蟊賊、縱運生花之筆、鼓如簧之舌、其乞靈宣傳之結果、適足自暴其罪狀、雖三尺童子、亦不受欺遑論蠱惑羣衆、希冀利用矣、</p>
<p>滬市商民　信念堅强哀我滬市商民、日在壓迫之下、含垢忍辱、窒息延命、喪資毀家、初不稍有搖奪者、蓋劉抗建必勝、具有堅强信念、咸謂國共合作、作戰致果、必能使領土主權完整、國家民族復興、從而出我民衆於水火而登諸袵席也、一旦驟聞貴黨背棄并日諾言、阻撓大軍反攻、無異晴空霹靂、澆頂冷水、誠不勝覆巢之慄懼、為之痛澈心肺、欲哭無淚焉、</p>
<p>篤守諾言　和衷共濟</p>
<p>素讅先生等皆時代之後彥、國家之注石、夙以先知先覺自任、令聞廣譽、久為社會所回欽、尚望勿逞意氣、以國族為重、迅勒懸崖之馬、賡續明恕之行、篤守前此諾言、與政府和衷共濟、完成抗建大業、不特人民信心、指顧可復、行見豐功偉績、永垂靑史、受萬世之景仰、我全滬各業公會、除請上海市商會於上月間先以巧電有所奉達外、因深盼國共之團結、用敢不憚辭費、重凟消聽、伏祈垂察、至深企禱、上海市商　所屬全市各業同業公會叩、</p>

<p>據航業界確息、日海軍現正企圖在舟山羣島及島明崇建築海軍根聽地、獨覇行駛上海　舟山定海及崇明間之日商航輪、近來對往返乘客、限制巳益奇嚴、舟山島日軍中尾部隊、自開築公路後、因迭遭華方流動部隊襲擊、故頗是恐慌、日駐華艦隊司令島田繁太郎、及上海日海軍司令小林、會終日前由滬搭艦赴定海、召開軍事會議、企圖死守、連日日艦集中舟山衜頭、及岱山海面者共達六艘、此中並有小型航空母艦一艘、華方沿海防軍、巳嚴予監視戒備、</p>

<h3>節减電力　尙無顯著影響</h3>
<p>工部局工業社會處報告、上月間節減電力之需要、對於工業出品、尚無顯著之影響、此殆因大多數工廠接獲節電通知、為期尚不過一兩星期也、重以所需節減之數量、為以往十三個月以內最高度用量百分之三十、則所减於近來用量者、似乎較低、職是之故、工業界所受影響、米見若何重大、</p>
<h3>郭順離滬說不確　過去數日未與外界接觸　致外間盛傳郭君已他往</h3>
<p>字林報減、可靠華方人士昨（一日）傳工部局華董郭順、近亦已離滬赴香港、經向靜安寺路郭寓所一再探詢、所得答覆為「郭君未在寓」、查郭氏與其他華董四人、已經納稅華人會推出蟬聯、但華董中虞洽卿與陳霆銳兩人、近己先後離滬、郭順繼之離去、在滬華董、乃剩兩人、英文大美晚報云、頃據與工部局華董郭順接近之人士聲稱、郭順尚未離滬、但不久諒將他去云、過去數日來、外界未能與郭順獲得接觸、乃有郭氏業巳離滬之傳說、但此說頃巳經吾認、</p>

<p>商業新聞</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米一經搜羅其價立漲</h3>
<p>昨日洋米晨漲晚跌、市面轉呈盤旋、惟結果仍比前市扯漲一二元、當早市開市時、累限價無形取消後、本客需要均盡興到市收買、囤貨方面亦公開出樣、然以需要轉旺、且聞寗方在市收買小絞英華司三五百噸、運往長江一帶接濟缺米區域、因此人心又被激刺、而執貨者與一般浮戶又趁機號召、市乃頓時欣欣向榮、現洋米市石交易者如小絞自早開即售百零六元、嗣後接續上升達百零七元半、中百零六元半、他如一號西貢去路亦廣、售開百十二元、百十一元、不過二號仍祗開百零六七元、東京砶尖高自百零一元、次至九十七元半、碾尖百零五元、米菉九十四元、碎尖八十七八元、次至七十四五元、總之較之前市小絞計增三元有奇、其他一二號西貢等貨僅加一二元之砠、原包英華司小絞米亦自一百廿五六元、漲至一百二十九元、價比前日加起三四元、然至午後本客實銷嫌貴停辦、轉口亦經足額、消貨頓呆、浮多與獲利反有求脫、故晚市回小一二元後、市面反見疲弱無神矣、全日交易因有轉口、總計連同原包共開二萬七八千包、昨日有苞米三千包運煙臺、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、一般貨主見洋米回緊、售心轉堅、故若薄粳去路既暢、行情頓見回起元半光景、開青角斛見薄稻百十元、次至百零八元半、不過厚粳以市貨較夥、銷塲又不佳、難能與薄稻抗衡、僅呈定局、常幫眞特粳斛見仍開百二十元、高粳百十八元、崑山高白粳斛見百十六元、次至百零九元、原包悉未做開、</p>
<p>糯米際斯環境賣買雙方心亦均向榮、故銷塲不獨零星胃口頗爽、即大戶亦有躉數交易、賣方遂扳俏喊高、結果售價並增元砠、開香港特兀百零六元、大市百零四元至百零二元。次一百元、糯菉特自九十八元、次至九十三元、</p>
<p>洋米又有到滬、怡和洋行裕生輪、前晚（一日）九時抵埠、由香港裝來一萬零二百六十四包、停靠羅斯福碼產學研起卸、聞夏老臣洋行經理永貞輪、由仰光載運洋米一萬七千餘包來滬、約今晨可到、（祖）</p>
<h3>粉市不脫盤旋</h3>
<p>粉市尚稱平穩、其過程尤必先疲後緊、不脫盤旋之狀態、查上午開盤、以洋粉存到既多、散戶隨市求脫、金龍牌坎粉一度鬆至二十八元六角半、旋因米價報升、客囤趁低吸收、市面復緊、金龍粉回升至二十八元九角、鐘樓花鳥牌二十九元三四角、成交約近萬包之數、平賣粉價無變動、由福新廠照常供給五千八百七十二包、其餘雯以洋粉補充之、</p>
<p>小麥市況、到銷均寂、市塲交易、久居停頓、日廠門市、亦必無貨可收、市面日趨沉靜、聞華廠方面。曾向洋商接洽定購澳麥、終以船隻缺乏、迄未成交云、</p>
<p>洋粉續有到埠、怡和洋行裕生輪、除由港裝來大批洋米外、另又半來麪粉一千零九十一包、前晚（一日）抵滬、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、今日有麵粉五百包、運往廈門係本粉、（祖）</p>
<h3>油市　豆油跌豆餅漲</h3>
<p>昨日豆油市面、實銷不振、人心疲憊之潛勢下、告跌二三元不等、期油雖由囤戶力挽危局、但大勢不利多頭、掙扎亦徒然、計成交大連油五十桶、價爲一百四十一元、訂四月上交一千二百桶、價爲一百四十一元二角半至一百三十九元五角、收　復爲一百四十元、訂四月下交六百桶、價爲一百四十三元五角至一百四十元零五角、豆餅自軋空以來、市曾緊漲一時、況邇來內地銷塲稍有問津、故在現貨不充之狀態下、更見俏俐、上日市因多頭略有出籠、故曾一度小跌、昨日內地去路續接、市又轉升、交易甡記餅三千片、價爲十七元二角至十七元三角二分、肥字餅一千片、價爲十七元零五分、昌記餅訂四月上交一千片、價爲十七元半、</p>
<p>三日出口豆子七百四十包、運廈門、又一百二十包、運香港</p>
<h3>金融　外匯交易　寥寥無幾</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市況、滙豐掛牌未更、英美匯暗市、呆定逾恒、半天毫無生動、蓋以交易寥寥無幾、投機商深感落手困難、聞收盤均告三辦士二三四三七五、及五元二八一二五、與隔昨現期均無軒輊、</p>
<p>期現均無榮辱</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條均平、美銀價及倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美對滬均未更動、美對英亦平、對滬縮四分、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金二辦士二三四三七五、美匯五元二八一二五、比上日俱無上落、開後市況靜寂無變、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉仍平、此後市勢續告呆定、交易無幾、祗聞投機商稍有塞出四月期美匯五元三一二五、而尚想拋空五月份美匯五元二八一二五、但外行對此價則無進意、故未曾成交、如是直至收盤、毫無生動、結果現貨與本月英金均仍告三辦士二三四三七五、美匯俱爲五元二八一二五、五月份英金三辦士一二八七五、美匯五元二五、比隔昨現期、均榮辱不分、</p>
<p>香港申匯升降</p>
<p>香港一日（週三）電、今明匯市開盤告平、英美日各匯俱無變動、申匯現貨降一元、爲四百六十一元五角、十時四十五分告平、申匯現貨回升一元五角、爲四百六十三元、十一時三十分告平、各匯均無變動、下午週三無市、</p>

<p>天津二日（週三）電、今晨匯市告平、倫敦及紐約電匯、白銀上落、申匯升一角、爲九十四元八角五分、「聯鈔」暗盤昂　元、爲六十三元五角、</p>
<h3>金市風平浪靜</h3>
<p>昨日烚赤暗盤狀態、更爲岑寂、亦改做期貨以來聽罕見之市面也、一因外匯缺乏上落、塲因風平浪靜、二因傭金加價、投機者無意下手、多數均爲了結交易、致成交驟減、約佔計一萬兩左右、價則終日徘徊於六千五微漲百五六十元之間、結果六元、爲六千五百六十三元、現貨市勢堅穩、初由祥和吸入成記二百兩、加一百四十元、繼之又進合盛六十兩、加一百五十元、後德孚與寶成公各進永成五十兩、及一利進合盛十兩、亦均加一百五十元、計此上日做高二十元之譜、</p>
<p>烚赤微好六元</p>
<p>晨初每條（十兩）開市首告六千五百六十元、計比上日做高四元、嗣因德成·德孚·大元及一利等拋出、曾步小至六千五百四十五元、但此後祥和猛吸、繼之新豐永·鑫兀·一利·大豐·公和先後吐塞、加以德大拋空、復又跌至六千五百五十七元、後賴晉元·萬豐收吸、而祥和·祥興永再進、且德大追跡搜買補空、故收盤前又升至六千五百六十五元、結果爲六千五百六十三元收盤、比上日軋漲六元、照四月美金五元二八一二五結價、爲六千五百九十四元一角、計撳三十一元一角、半天祗廿二元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高一百八十元、收進比賣價減低五十元、現標金等均無行無市、</p>
<p>飾金兌價未動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、終日未動、計大同行與新同行仍均　六百九十元、收進減低四十元光影、</p>
<h3>外幣變動狹隘</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市況、烚赤市價呆定、英美金鎊因亦無上落、英金票仍無變動、美金票變動渺小、開盤爲六角七分、開後退至六角半、輾而步高至六角九分、收盤又退爲十八元六角七分、結果與上日相若、香港票供求均勻、市價站平、日金票及朝鮮票均趨疲軟、前者退至一元九角七分、後者降爲一元六角四分、</p>
<h3>證券　公債骨子甚堅</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日市況趨勢繼續疲軟、各號交易入此出彼、頗多紊亂、惟信孚又轉有進胃、九成進胃亦強、如同康則進出頻繁、裕興則頗有賣出、形勢表面疲勢。內裏仍屬堅定、因多方投資居多、浮多憶逐漸減少、數日疲軟、空方加碼已多、環境稍優、反動必鉅、昨日交易、上午信孚九成順昌鑫源買進、聯和則出丙進乙、賣戶大都爲散戶居多、裕興賣出甲種不少、午後仁昌九成買進、同康入戊出丙、久豐稍有賣出、裕興續有拋售甲種、故結果甲種獨小三角、餘祗小五分一角至二角、目下行市以甲乙兩種最便宜、昨日成交總數共計約八九十萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>類別　最高　　　最低　　　收盤　　　比前日</p>
<p>統甲　七五五五　七五三〇　七五三〇　跌·三〇</p>
<p>統乙　六八五五　六八四〇　六八四五　平</p>

<p>股票交易、成交民誼藥廠股五十股、價爲二十元零二角半、</p>
<p>英商怡和啤酒有限公司昨經董事會議決、定於四月二十二日開派末次股息、每股國幣二角五分、</p>
<p>倫敦一日（週二）電、今日中國外佔及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、仍告平滯、祗銀行股票　告回俏、麥加利銀行股上升五先令、價爲八鎊十五先令、匯豐銀行英倫註冊股升一鎊半、價爲七十五鎊、香港註冊股升半鎊、價爲七十七鎊、有行無市、餘無變動、</p>
<h3>紗花　多空兩難　紗市僵局</h3>
<p>紗市暗淡而乏精彩、趨勢甚弱、且升降範圍僅在二元之間、足見人心之渙散一般矣、此種景象、爲本年以來所未見、實則環境如斯也、做多因存貨壅積、兩廠單予現貨價雖離太遠、做空百物殊昂、廠方開激提高、亦不十分穩妥、所以遂呈多空俱難之地步、因此投機的人毋、都喊暫時無瞄頭矣、二十支雙馬高價爲一千三百九十四元、低價一千三百九十一元半、午後因週三集會者星散、行市未有做開、今日有棉紗七百〇五件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開人氣極其平庸、毫無風頭、首盤價爲一千三百九十三元、少頃微疲至二元半、然塲內買賣殊清、市盤無甚變動、旋後聞外滙寗靜、標金安定、市而更少起伏、一經在一千三百九十三四元之間往返有二小時之久、中途曾一度停頓、掮客均束手無事、繼至收盤價爲一千三百九十四元、查半日間成交統計三千七百六十五包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分別如左、香港四六五同行三、三〇〇統計三、七六五</p>
<h3>細絨廠胃較活　投機出紗進花</h3>
<p>現棉情況、不及上日之熱鬧、此因紗市並不起色、加以外滙寗靜、所以又復平凡、廠方對於三十二支及四十二支原料、因貨時有需求、對於二十支原料心思平常、惟一般投機者又復活動、因棉花存底較紗爲薄、因此有一部份賣去棉紗、掉進棉花、大有人在、此邇來同業買賣活躍者之所由來也、不過根本問題、紗市既不能高漲、廠家亦不願購貴棉而虧本、且來源依然暢通、無非投機的人毋移東補西之方法也、昨日成交共計一千零八十二件、又六百三十六包、價則跌小一二元不等、茲錄現棉行市如左、</p>
<p>紐約美棉電、市況參差不定、先因同業買進而漲、後因南方幫之套賣、及多頭了結及政治消息利於空頭而跌、收盤結果、較之上日再跌八至十磅音不等、</p>

<p>車疋市盤稍疲</p>
<p>廠布中市堅穩如故、本街及粵港幫實需均有進展、怡和粗布因期貨行盤猛漲、各擋現貨漲每疋二角半至五角、統益廠十六磅花蝶粗布亦漲五角至七角、細布平平、斜紋漲一角至二角半、粵港邦辦美人魚色斜紋一百數十件、浙閩幫辦粗細布色布七八十件、本街染廠及批發號辦坯布粗細布色布等八百餘件、疋頭二日出口五十件運煙台、三日運廈門三十一件、運香港一千一百六十件、</p>
<p>東布因紗市平庸、市盤稍疲、白貨細布回跌每疋一二角、十磅龍頭細布新棧單、下午收盤、現貨四十九元八角、惟色貨嗶嘰、緣細紗綫仍昂、市勢殊緊、四君子嗶嘰棧單、價迴旋在一元四角三分至三分　五、</p>
<p>呢絨各貨明暗堅挺、北平及天津幫、邇來齊有大量購辦、春夏呢絨尤殷、秋令貨具有相當者、需辦亦盛、西裝料較之華　衣料、購辦爲殷勤、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煙煤屑日日高</h3>
<p>煙煤屑各貨、自月前新到基隆屑六千餘噸、以後少有來源、然各幫需求甚殷、故市勢日見堅挺、開平二號屑二百八十元、印度屑三百二十元、博山屑二百七十五元、基降屑二百五十元、以上均同業行折、送到客家、酌加行槓、</p>
<p>煙白煤向貨、上月間因各行關住不出、本已有行無市、一任暗盤猖狂、操縱市面、不意昨日某行同行拆盤、又見抬高、印度煙煤高喊每噸四百元、鴻基煤三百七十元、一號小子三百七十元、較前市加起二三十元行情、尚無大批流出云、</p>

<p>梔子因到貨無繼、行市曾漲起二十外元、緊勢迄未稍鬆、昨據產區消息、因輪運不通、無法裝出、茲已改用帆船裝運、在約不日即可轉申、但產價又升、而運費反增、後市仍年續緊云、</p>
<h3>五金　本釘白鐵盛極而衰</h3>
<p>本釘　本廠釘日前狂跳甚厲、標準曾超越二百元關、然查其實銷、卻並不衆多、乃一般囤戶幫搜羅、囤積居奇所致、但終因去路稀少、現貨頓形充塞、市塲供過於求、以致行情疲落、昨每桶倍司一百九十五元、</p>
<p>白鐵　平白鐵市面、亦有與本廠釘同病相憐之象、且同爲建築幫之用品、然該幫近日殊乏納胃、故流通貨亦厭過盛、致售盤亦軟、刻如六尺十五元、七尺十六元左右、</p>

<h3>燭皂頻漲不已</h3>
<p>肥皂市價、買氣堅強、因各方進胃頗暢、廠方祗有少數派出同業不敷應求、致價步升不已、昨市固本皂每箱買四十八元五角、白祥茂皂每箱四十七元、黃祥茂皂三十八元五角、較上週又經起五元之多、</p>
<p>洋燭行情買價步步高騰、因囤戶不斷搜購、公司方面供應較我希、致市氣緊俏、如船牌每箱（二十五封）已售至三十元〇四角、各方需要頗濃、還看上漲、</p>

<h3>特載　天奇的指畫　涸肇桐</h3>
<p>國畫中的指畫、溯其源流、應該是唐朝張璪為首創、他曾手摸絹素、作成很好的畫幅、使當時名家畢宏驚奇而閣筆、或問所授、則日「外師造化、中得心源、」及至淸季、高其佩以夢寐之中、學得指頭書、所作人物·山水·禽魚·無不生動·從此指責、便為人所注意了、</p>
<p>指畫與通常的毛筆畫、在媒材上固然有着不同、就是畫面予以觀者的感覺、也是特異的、它加强毛筆的渾厚、又却除了它的軟弱、燥則靈活挺秀、濕則雄健古樸、出神入化、妙造自然、實非筆畫所能逮、</p>
<p>可是、在國賮家中、對於這種具有獨特效果的指畫、多不研習、淺學之輩、更無力從事、此固非神悟力學者、不克窮其奧秘、梁溪張子天奇、執教美專國畫、課餘之暇、潛心製作、二十年如一日、允工於指畫、林烏幽禽、松梅竹石、一經指頭之揮洒、則一角佈置、愈見空靈、其所宗法者、有白陽新羅、靑藤南田、伯年諸家、集其神髓、卓然自一百家、從此次展出的數十幅作成品看、像二八〇號「眉壽圖」、二七叫號「玉堂春暖」、二〇九號「笋竹八哥」、構成別緻、疎花細蕊、風趣翩翩、二七八號「薔薇蜘蛛」、二六六號「白荷蜻蜓」、二六〇號「桃柳黃鶯」諸幅、賦色明麗、位置安穩、頗得高雅蒼勁生動古逸之韻致、一一四號「荷塘淸趣」一幀、原作曾由劉海粟氏二度歐遊時携往柏林展覽、終為德國國家美術館購藏、茲經複製陳列、雖僅一花一葉、於章法中不覺其簡、而超然塵俗的淸趣、盎然紙上、水墨數幀、亦別饒奇味、二一五號「耄耋富貴」李仲乾氏題句云、耄耋諧聲圖貓蝶、嘉各富貴寫天香、天奇好奇指代筆、神妙變化分陰陽、二一三號「墨葴水禽圖」李仲乾氏題句云、張君作盡不用筆、六八法皆從　指出、偶然貌得水禽鳴、野水蘆花秋瑟瑟、其二一七號「貓蝶牡丹」一幀、朱天梵氏有題記云、「指頭生活、昔人偶一為之、以博興趣而已、目淸鐵嶺高其佩專力於此、其境域始廓、高氏以後、繼嚮者絕鮮其人、天奇此幀、指法老到、水墨渾厚、有鐵嶺骨力、而兼得靑藤、復堂風趣、洵傑作也」、</p>

<h3>美國有兒童城</h3>
<p>— 郭洪迪</p>
<p>美國有兒童城。</p>
<p>兒童城中有兒童警察，兒童法庭，兒童市長，兒童報紙，兒童音樂隊，兒童工塲，兒童俱樂部，兒童運動塲，兒童球隊，兒童攝影會。兒童城是兒童所組織，由兒童管理，謀兒童福利的機關。</p>
<p>美國的克里芙蘭城，有兒童城六處，有八歲至十八歲的公民三千。城裹的兒童，每天利用空暇的時間，在一起工作，在一起遊戲，他們練習合作，學習奉公守法。兒童在兒童城中，得到了新的興趣，有了新的習慣，養成了新的人格。</p>
<p>在一九三七年，克里芙蘭城發生兒童犯罪案件二千一百零一起，可是自從有了兒童城以後，兒童犯罪的案件平均每年减至二百三十五起。兒童城的公民每人每月付稅三分錢，六個兒童城全年的費用是四千元。每入每年的平均費用還不到兩塊錢。是的，這是一個奇蹟，可是這種奇蹟並小是偶然的。這種奇蹟能發生在美國，也能生在中國，能發生在克里芙蘭城，也就能够發生在上海。</p>
<p>美國有兒童城，我們希望有一天，中國也會有兒童城，上海也會有兒童城。</p>
<p>社會</p>
<h3>托兒所的意義</h3>
<p>— 嚴君馥</p>
<p>托兒所　始於十九世紀未葉，可以說是工業革命的產物；它的發展有社會的需要為推動力，而這需要隨着國家的工業化，近代化及婦女的覺悟而繼續加强。工業革命後的生產方式，需要熟練的技巧勝於强大的體力，這使得婦女能與男子同樣地參加社會生產事業；另一方面工資勞動者的收入常是以個人為單位的，在這種狀况下，婦女實有參加生產工作的必要。由於婦女對於獨立人格的覺悟及參加社會工作的經騐，使婦女更進一步的認清了要求男女間的眞正平等，必須先謀求經濟能力的平等。但是職業與育兒間有許多不可避免的衝突，於是托兒所應運而生，担負起雙重的重要功能，一方面協助婦女，使能繼續從事職業，維持家庭，致力於婦女解放運動；一方面保護兒童，使其身心兩方面都能得到健全的發展。托兒所現在歐美各國都已有顯蒼的發展。</p>
<p>蘇聯自從十月革命之後，一方面為了確立婦女解放的基礎，减少婦女從事生產工作的障碍，使其能與男子有同樣的機會，作同等的貢獻；另方面則是為了保護幼兒，訓練幼兒，確保其能得到充份的照顧與集體生活的訓練，所以將托兄所的設施列入政府施政綱領中，舉凡工廠，農塲，學校，商店，以至公園，影院等都有各種常設的，季節的及臨時的托兒所的設立。總數有好幾萬，照顧的幼兒達數百萬之多。</p>
<p>我國的慈幼機關如靑嬰堂孤兒院等的創辦，歷史俱長，惟托兒所則為近十年來的一種新運動，並不是育嬰堂或孤兒院的新名詞。它是社會教育機關的一種，輔助家庭，却不代替家庭；這也就是它與育嬰或孤兒院的根本差別，因為讀者是慈善性質的救濟機關，代簪家庭盡育兒的責任。山於人才經濟種種方面的限制，十年來這一運動並沒有得到廣大的開展。在戰事發生前，上海，南京，廣州，靑島，北平，無錫等地，曾有此種設施，可惜在根基尚米建穩，還沒有能發生倡導與示範的作用前，就在無情的砲火聲中夭折了。對於這正在萌芽時期的新運動，實在是一個很大的打擊。</p>
<p>上海是一個工商業要埠，女工及職業婦女人數衆多，在雙重任務的壓迫下，她們的痛苦不言可喻。上海女靑年鑒於托兒所對於上海婦女的需要，故有舉辦職業婦女托兒所及上海托兒所的倡議，經過牛年餘的籌備，更蒙社會上熱心人士的多方面贊助，或捐贈金錢衣物或貢獻個人經騐，或犧牲時間精力，使此兩所卒能於今日與各界人士相見，我們實在覺得非常的快慰。職業婦女托兒所附設於慕爾嗚路女靑年會會所內，專收職婦的幼兒，日間寄托，晚間領回；上海托兒所則段於白利南路同仁醫院內，專收工人子女，日夜寄托。由於經濟條件的限制，兩所的規校都是很小的，雖然如此，我們對於它却存着深厚的希望。我們不以為那是吶所孤獨的托兒所，却作為一個社會化的慈幼運動的開端。更希望社會人士繼續地給予它物質上的支持與精神上的鼓勵，使這小小的生命能够壯健起來，使道一運動發生力量，進而擴展到各生產部門與全國各地。在慶祝兒童節時，我們深幸又看到到了兒童福利事業的一綫新曙光</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（六）愛情結晶品</p>
<p>他倒眞是好意，但這件事秋海棠怎麼能對他說呢？而且他越是這樣問，越使秋海棠心裹覺得慌亂起來；要不是多年唱戲的經騐幫助他，幾乎無法再掩飾。</p>
<p>「實在祇是一些小事，七爺。」他像做戲一樣的勉强裝得鎭定起來，還故意低下頭去，拂去了衣角上的一些灰麈。</p>
<p>「好，那末我就先走了！紹文戴上了帽子，一路走一路向他說；「你能够去最好，眞的不能走也不妨，反正三叔也沒有什麼正事。」</p>
<p>往常因為紹文在他家裹走動得很動，所以彼此就不拘什麼客套了，紹文要走，他總是站起來點點頭就算了，今天他却破例把他送到了門口，心裹似乎覺得十二萬分的對不起他，同時又惟恐他再退回來。</p>
<p>這對於紹文，當然是格外覺得很奇怪的，他在車子上不住的反覆思索着，不知道他這一個好朋友的態度，今天為什麼變得巡　突然反常起來？</p>
<p>就在他一路狐疑莫決的時候，秋海棠已躱進了自己的臥室去，來不及的撕聞了湘綺的來信，在一種興奮得幾乎就要暈過去的情緒下，開始一行一行的閱看了。</p>
<p>「你走了之後，我有整整一畫夜忘記了睡覺，忘記了吃飯。對於你，我富然可以毫無忌諱的說：最初我心裹的確是充滿了懊悔和怨恨的感覺，好像有許多人站在我的面前指着我痛罵，我險些眞要相信自己巳經犯了一椿大罪了！一個已有丈夫的女人，怎麽再能幹出這種事來呢？何况你還是一個戲子，一個唱旦角的戲子……」</p>
<p>看到道裹，秋海棠的臉是完全漲紅了，心裏也不由深深地懊悔前天晚上不該那樣的興奮，以致破壞了自已好幾年來的揀守，和自己眞心敬愛的一個女人的貞節。</p>
<p>「也許她從此不肯冉理我了！」他不由懷疑道一封信或者就是絕交信呢？</p>
<p>但冉看下一節，湘綺的語氣便完全不同了。（七一）</p>
<p>自然</p>
<h3>小飛行家</h3>
<p>— 羅文</p>
<p>在生物中，昆蟲可說是最傑出的飛行家；魚兒的叶行和它比起來顯得那麽笨拙，至於飛機　直像一隻笨重的木箱了。昆蟲能够在風中翱翔，能够像滑翔機一般地滑走，能够在起飛後一秒分鐘內達到最高速度，而在狹小的空中從事種種驚人「表演」。最精於飛行的昆蟲又能够不變更身體的地位而向後倒飛。</p>
<p>昆蟲的翼是天生最適於飛行的。它們是非常地輕。—雄蜂的四翼只有牛公絲重吧了。可是雖然是那麼樣輕，却又非常堅牢。翼的前半部較後半部更為堅牢。</p>
<p>大多數蝴蝶和許多蛾，前翼和後翼重疊着，形成一對翅膀而飛行。雙翼間由下鈞運繫着，因此它們可以隨心所欲地一忽兒變成「雙葉機」，一忽又變成「單葉機」。</p>
<p>昆蟲並不是僅將其翼上下撲動。有一位昆蟲學家把金箔片附在黃蜂的翼端，終是冉用一股强烈的允綫對它照耀。他看到蜂翼形成8字形轉動着。</p>
<p>因此昆蟲之翼較飛機的推進機有着更大的效能，同時它還有着垂直上升飛機的飛行設備。</p>
<p>推動昆蟲之翼的「為達」有時候是極强有力的。美國的一位會騐家把一隻蒼蠅解剖的結果，發現它的翼筋筧有它全部體重百分之三十的重量。</p>
<p>會對蜜蜂的飛行能力作專鬥研究的貝絲（U．D．Betts女士，指出：蜜蜂的「飛行馬達」（翼筋）耗費極多的燃料（即蜂蜜）。據最折調查所得，出外飛行的蜜蜂每小時須消費三四十公絲的蜜，也就是說在二小時的飛行中，一隻蜜蜂須食取和它體重相等量的食物。</p>

<h3>美國民意學會</h3>
<p>— 今純</p>
<p>美國民意學會會長蓋勒普博士，調查美國民衆的思想時，會發現許多極有趣的事情。譬如，他發現在美國一班參加投票的民衆中，有百分之三十都不會游泳，假使參加總統競選的是一個女子的話，那以民衆中有百分之六十六都將拒絕投她的票。</p>
<p>民意學會所發現的趣事很多，它發現美國民衆有百分之七十七，都以為這次世界大戰的發生應由德國負咎；它發現美艱民衆對於經濟不景氣眞正的原因，意見最為紛歧，衆說一致的蓋僅佔全數百分之五；它發現美國民衆有百分之四十，都不喜歡擺勤式的爵士音樂；有百分之十，乾脆連擺動音樂是甚麽都不知道：有百分之七十五，都相信來世之說（祇有一個老年人說：他現在雖不知究竟，但大的不久就可以曉得的）。民衆中有百分之七十，都希望政府能取消禁締，令關於節育的文字得日由刊行，有百分之六十，都歡迎溫莎公爾夫婦，能永遠在美國作萬公，有百分之六，都不願乘飛機往歐洲遊歷，即使是一個錢不花，他們也不去。</p>
<p>蓋勒普會作各種調查統計，他知道那一個無綫電節目最受民衆歡迎，雜誌中那一篇故事最引民衆注意。他發現民衆中有一大半都愛看報紙雜誌上的照片與滑稽畫。蓋氏還時刻調配比較美國民衆對於羅斯福總統及其新政的愛惡程度。眞奇怪極了，據蓋氏的調查統計所示，羅斯福總統之得民心，是與他釣魚有關係的，他每出去釣一次魚，民衆愛護他的心情使增進一層。</p>

<h3>絕技</h3>
<p>— 李立本</p>
<p>—來稿精華之一</p>
<p>她有一種絕技，就是「哭』；這「哭」是有調門的，能把過去的一切事蹟，添油加醬地一併編入這哭調內。哭時，措手頓足，有時嗚咽嘔啞，有時氣急無聲。假使有人去勸的話，她會把你肩上一拍，連你的事也會編入哭調內去，而日哭聲越發厲害。可惜這種哭聲有一缺點，便是不能博得旁人的同情。原因很簡單，就是她在哭時，內心的悲哀不能自然透露。也許這番的哭，根本內心沒有什麼悲哀可言，不過吾所謂「哭死人罵活人」罷了。（却酬）</p>

<p>新片介紹</p>
<h3>劍底鴛鴦</h3>
<p>— 程冰奴</p>
<p>「基度山恩仇記」是大仲馬的名著，作為續基度山恩仇記的「劍底鴛鴛」却並不是仲馬的手筆，而是好萊塢編劇家費盡心機去構思出來的。話雖如此，「劍底鴛鴛」故事的風格，却和「基度山恩仇記」沒有什麼兩樣，而是同樣地潑刺，刺激，並且富於想像力。</p>
<p>魯易海華飾主角基度山之子，他是全歐洲最富的一個人，年靑而又會擊劍，他史具正義感，並且愛蒼女人。這樣血型的漂亮人物，無疑地會得到那個小國公主的愛好，和銀幕下無數觀衆的擁護了。瓊裴納飾公主，雍容華貴，比她在時裝片裹要好看得多。喬治山德士飾懷着陰謀的獨裁者，在他個人的演劇史裹，「劍底鴛鴦」可說是他最好的一部。</p>
<p>這故事就是寫瓊裴納給山德士幽禁宮中，魯易海華為了要拯救她和她的子民，他白天裹假裝着是一個不諳世務的花花公子，晚上却幹着驚天動地的事業。就故事的本身論，它和過去的「寶劍留痕」「紅花俠」是沒有什麼異樣的，但因為全片充滿着刺激的動作，輕快的調子，和豐富的想像，使觀衆一點不感覺到陳舊。導演者允其懂得觀衆心理，常常使本片男女兩主角陷於千鈞一髮的危難中，然後出其不意地來挽救，使觀衆拍着胸哺喊着「險呀」。卽以最後一個高潮而論，山德士和瓊裴納要結婚了，畫面上是他們倆慢慢步入禮堂，慢慢戴結婚戒，牧師慢慢地宣讀誓言，看得觀眾幾於要去把魯易海華拖來，然後魯易海華以驚人的姿態出現，在衆自睽睽之中，宣佈山德士的陰謀，接着以高超的劍術，結果了出德士的件命，然後大快人心與瓊裴納「有情人成了眷屬」。</p>
<p>魯易海華飾這種角色，最合身份，他的風趣，他的英武，較之泰羅鮑華，別有一種動人的地方，也許這就是因為他比泰歲鮑華還　會得演戲吧？</p>

<p>— 莫野</p>
<p>當史吉邦·拉靜的吼聲，尚饗澈於耳畔的今日，我們却以更欣慰更暢快的心情，接受了這份偉大的禮物。</p>
<p>這是較之於「羣英喋血記」更藝術，更偉大的巨片！它是新生蘇聯的史詩，千萬革命同志的殷鑒。雖然編劇者用了更多的字幕，接近於傳記的形式一可是由於導演剪接的恰當，在整整二時有餘的演出中，我們絲毫不覺得有所厭倦，或是乏味，較之我們的「孔夫子」（同樣的也是用着很多的字幕，說明着聖人的不朽偉業！）把握住更緊張的氣氛，更多的利用了電影上的特殊技巧；這些似乎都似較勝一籌的地方。</p>
<p>我們要建立起民族作風和民族形式，一個民族自然該有它特別的風格。在蘇聯的電影裏，活躍於整個畫面上的是沉重，嚴肅而有力；俏皮與玲俐是談不到的。由於這，我們更應該如何的學習，為自己光輝的民族藝術努力！</p>
<p>在全片中，除了氣氛的够緊外，對於大塲面的處理，那些緊張，危險，人與人肉搏的鏡頭，簡直是空前絕後。千餘入的鬥爭，能處理得有條不紊，不愧為元老導演；就是好萊塢也有望塵莫及之感。</p>
<p>普特符金對於畫面的構圖，美麗，宏偉，雄壯，除了這我們簡直無可加以疵語，就是襯托也是其獨具匠心。而允以民衆含淚翹首，望着莫期科的毀滅，各城首都的淪陷，千萬的民衆，帶着一顆顆失望，憤懣，怒火，走上他們的流亡之途，非但情緒的感動觀衆，挑撥人們的心弦，構圖也是達到最優秀的境地，一幅一幅的有如精細的木刻一樣。</p>
<p>波薩斯基與米寧的扮演者，都演來是那麼沉着，一些也找不到浮漂之處。</p>
<p>多餘的，也許就是空閒超趨了侷限的時間。</p>

<p>「血淚相思」的內容，叙述一個大家閨秀，醉心於音架，和一個音樂師發生了戀愛，就在結婚的前夜，她犧牲了一切，隨着音樂師一同私奔到維也納，受盡種種的磨折，度着悽慘的生活，結果在一家酒店中充當歌女，維持他倆的生活，想不到一個軍官看中了她，竟和她丈夫比劍，做了劍不之鬼，害她度着百年遺恨的凄苦寡鵠生活。</p>

<h3>Declaration by the Eighth Plenary Session: Guaranteeing China's Continued Warfare; Decision to Appoint Guo Taiqi as Foreign Minister; Appointment of Wang Chonghui as Secretary-General of the National Defense Council; Liu Yazi Expelled from the Party</h3>
<p>Chongqing, Eighth Plenary Session, decision made at the one-day conference: (1) Comrade Ye Chucang, Secretary-General of the Central Executive Committee, resigned due to illness; Comrade Wu Tiecheng was appointed as his successor; (2) Comrade Liu Weichi was appointed as the Minister of the Overseas Department of the Central Committee, with Comrades Chen Qingyun and Dai Kuisheng as Deputy Ministers, Comrade Zhou Qigang was appointed as the Deputy Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and Comrade Xiao Jishan was appointed as a standing member of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission; (3) Comrade Zeng Yangfu, Acting Deputy Minister of the Central Organization Department, was assigned to other tasks, and Comrade Zhang Chong was appointed as his successor; (4) Comrade Zhang Qun, Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council, was assigned to other tasks, and Comrade Wang Chonghui was appointed as his successor; (5) Guo Taiqi was transferred and appointed as Foreign Minister. (Telegraph, 2nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing, according to reliable sources, the government has decided to recall Guo Taiqi, the ambassador to the UK, to serve as the Foreign Minister, and to appoint Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui as the Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council. This decision has been approved by the Eighth Plenary Session. The Eighth Plenary Session, which concluded today, issued a declaration expressing gratitude for the aid from the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union, and guaranteeing that China will continue fighting until there are no Japanese soldiers left within Chinese territory and until the Japanese abandon their attempt to dominate East Asia. The plenary session also resolved to appoint Wu Tiecheng, the former mayor of Shanghai and the current head of the Overseas Department, as the Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, succeeding Ye Chucang, who resigned due to illness. Wu's position as head of the Overseas Department will be succeeded by Liu Weichi. As for the position of ambassador to the UK, Gu Weijun, a veteran Chinese diplomat currently serving as the ambassador to France, is the most highly favored candidate. The authorities neither confirmed nor denied this. The plenary session's declaration also stated that although China is facing an unprecedented war, it is still making every effort to improve itself in order to realize a democratic government. The government has decided to implement economic controls to protect the lives of ordinary people during wartime, and the consistency of orders and military discipline must also be strictly maintained. Official reports indicate that the Central Executive Committee made many resolutions to improve administration during its meeting. The Executive Yuan will add two departments, namely the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Commerce, to replace the current Foreign Trade Commission and the National Food Administration. The selection of new personnel has not yet been finalized, but they will be appointed soon. The three-year wartime construction plan will also be launched immediately, and the five-year plan for popular education will utilize the Chinese phonetic alphabet in order to popularize the national language. The Central Executive Committee also decided to allocate funds to implement this plan. (Associated Press dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing, at the Eighth Plenary Session, the presidium of the two-day conference submitted a proposal from the Central Organization Department to expel Liu Yazi from the party in order to maintain party discipline. The proposal was approved by a vote of the entire body. The original proposal stated: "It has been found that Central Supervisory Committee member Liu Yazi, since leaving Shanghai for Hong Kong, has made various statements in publications and public speeches that slander the Central Committee and violate the interests of the country. Despite repeated requests, both direct and indirect, for him to come to Chongqing and work together to overcome the current difficulties, all efforts have been unsuccessful. Even after sending a telegram urging him to attend this plenary session, he has continued to wantonly denigrate the party, which is a serious violation of party discipline. Therefore, we specifically propose that he be expelled from the party in order to maintain party discipline." (Telegraph, 2nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing, since the opening of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, there have been ten general meetings, one plenary discussion, and a total of thirteen review meetings by the Party Affairs, Political Affairs, Military Affairs, Economic Affairs, and Education groups. At each general meeting, resolutions were passed under the chairmanship of Committee Members Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Ding Weifen, Chen Guofu, Sun Ke, Feng Yuxiang, Kong Xiangxi, and Dai Chuanxian. President Chiang and all committee members attended on time. The first to eighth general meetings were devoted to listening to reports from the various departments of the Central Committee, the Three Principles of the People Youth League, the various departments and commissions of the National Government, the party headquarters and governments of various provinces and cities, and the party and government reports from various border provinces. This took up a great deal of time, as the purpose was to review the past and plan for the future, so that the resolutions made would be more practical and not merely empty rhetoric. The conference received more than ninety proposals, which were first carefully reviewed by various review committees before being submitted to the conference for discussion. As for the declaration of the conference, a drafting committee was formed, consisting of twelve members, including Dai Chuanxian, Kong Xiangxi, Gu Mengyu, Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, Chen Bulei, Chen Lifu, Wang Shijie, Liang Hancao, Pan Gongzhan, Huang Luyi, and Hong Lanyou, convened by Sun Ke and Chen Bulei. A resolution of the conference established a sorting committee of fourteen members, including Dai Chuanxian, Kong Xiangxi, Li Wenfan, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Bulei, He Yingqin, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, Xu Kan, Liang Hancao, Gu Zhenggang, Gan Naiguang, Pan Gongzhan, and Di Ying, convened by Committee Member Wu Tiecheng.

<h3>Special Transport Management Committee Established</h3>
<p>Chongqing, according to sources in the transportation sector, the government has recently established a Special Transport Management Committee to unify all matters related to the import of materials, export of goods, and allocation of vehicles on the Yunnan-Burma Road. He Yingqin, Minister of Military and Political Affairs, serves as the chairman, and the committee has four departments: Transportation, Resources, Purchasing, and Secretariat. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>London, Ernest Brown, the Secretary of State for India and Burma, stated in the House of Commons yesterday that the British government has agreed to provide funding to allow the Burmese government to build a railway from Lashio to the border, so that the Burmese railway can be connected to the Chinese railway. It is reported that the Yunnan-Burma Road is not sufficient to meet the trade needs between the two countries, so it is necessary to connect the railways of the two countries for the long term.

<h3>Full Text of President Chiang's Address at the Eighth Plenary Session</h3>
<p>Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) Currently, public opinion generally holds excessive concerns about China's current economic problems. In my observation, there is really nothing to worry about in China's economy. Some people are criticizing us, mocking us, believing that our Party is not working hard enough, is too slack, and even saying that we are corrupt and aging. We must acknowledge and accept all these criticisms. From today onwards, we must thoroughly reflect on ourselves in order to make up for our mistakes and strive for achievements. We must bring our revolutionary spirit to any undertaking, overcome all difficulties, and strive for continuous progress. If we can catch up quickly, I believe it will not be difficult to solve the current economic crisis. Everyone must know that this plenary session is taking place at a time when the work of national construction is truly beginning. We really have the responsibility to build on the past and lead the construction of the nation. If we cannot establish a spirit of national construction, if we cannot inspire all Party members and the people of the whole country to work together to build the nation, then our sacrifices and efforts of the past three years will truly be wasted. However, observing the past three years and eight months, especially in the last six months, our spirit of struggle has indeed been declining day by day. From the Party to the government, from our central authorities to the local levels, all kinds of undertakings, whether Party affairs, politics, national economy, lack a new spirit and new economic power. I believe that this is a huge crisis. We cannot attribute this responsibility to the government, nor can we attribute it to the people. We cannot attribute it to the harsh internal and external environment, but to the leading Party that is resisting and building the nation, especially to the comrades of the Central Committee who are present today. We should never forget the teachings of "The revolution has not yet succeeded." If we, the hundreds of comrades who are present today, can all be united and invigorated, and still display our powerful spirit as we did more than three years ago, then finally</p>
<p>Speaking of Party Affairs</p>
<p>and the government, these are the foundation of our revolution. Everyone must know that the fundamental problem at present is to make politics have a new atmosphere and Party affairs have a new spirit. We must complete national construction in the future from a new politics, but to get politics on track, we must first seek the soundness of our Party. Therefore, I would like to say a few simple words to all comrades today, especially regarding Party affairs. We must have a clear understanding of the current international environment and domestic situation, as well as the Party's position. We must know that the Party's position in China is different from that of ruling parties with a considerable foundation in other countries, such as the National Socialist Party of Germany, the Fascist Party of Italy, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. We are still in the revolutionary period, and all our Party members must work hard in the most basic and practical ways, especially from the grassroots and in social work. We are not afraid that the Party's power will not be strong, nor are we afraid that China's politics will not be sound, but only afraid that our Party will be isolated from society, so that our politics cannot establish a widespread and deep foundation. We</p>
<p>became party members, and a few became Central Committee members, certainly to shoulder the revolutionary duty, not for high office and great wealth, or to demand personal power and position. Not only that, but we, as Central Committee members, must always listen to public opinion, so we must serve society and do our best to fulfill our duties, truly being able to connect with the masses. Because whichever committee member, if he can work hard in the most basic undertakings in politics or society, and serve in the places closest to the people, is the most proper way for us to devote ourselves to the revolution, and then we will be worthy of being true revolutionary party members. If the foundation of our Party is not yet solid, and the Party's beliefs have not yet been established, and the general comrades think that we should have a special status and should enjoy special rights, this is completely wrong. You must know that the revolution has not yet succeeded, the principles have not yet been realized, our shame has not been wiped away, and our responsibilities have not been fulfilled. In the future, to invigorate the hearts of the people of the whole country, the responsibility lies entirely with this Party, entirely with our general Central Committee members. To establish the foundation of the Party, the responsibility also lies entirely with the cadres at all levels of this Party, and entirely with our general Central Committee members. The Premier has given us detailed instructions and arrangements for all our revolutionary undertakings, plans, and efforts in his entire will. As long as we recognize our own</p>
<p>responsibilities</p>
<p>and earnestly follow the teachings of the Premier, then all our services to society will be fulfilling all the responsibilities of party members, and establishing all the foundations of society for this Party. As long as we never fear hardship and go deep into society and get close to the people, so that the foundation of this Party in society becomes increasingly solid, then our great cause of revolutionary nation-building can be quickly successful. Therefore, our plenary session should have a practical resolution on the Party members' participation in local politics and social service work, so that this time</p>
<p>after the meeting</p>
<p>, the organization, spirit, discipline, and morality of our Party can be further enriched, actively improved, and have a new reform, in order to create a new atmosphere, so that we can truly shoulder the responsibility of our revolutionary nation-building. What I have said above are just a few simple reminders, but they are really the most important keys to the success or failure of our revolution. I hope that all comrades will concentrate on studying and discussing these issues during this plenary session, in order to complete the mission of continuing the past and opening up the future that this plenary session is responsible for.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Issue of Seats on the Shanghai Municipal Council</h3>
<p>The election of the board of directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council has been the subject of intense discussion for months. The matter was first addressed the night before last when the Secretary-General of the Council, Mr. Fessenden, issued a statement. He said that the issue had been the subject of negotiations between the consuls of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, and the "greatest interests" of the Shanghai International Settlement. It was agreed to suggest to the Consular Body and the Chinese government that the original number of seats on the board of directors be changed to four Chinese, three British, three American and Japanese each, one German, and two from other countries for a certain period of time. This change not only breaks the precedent of a gentleman's agreement that has been in place for ten years, but also conflicts with the provisions of the Yangjingbang Land Regulations regarding the number of seats on the board of directors. How this will affect the future of the Settlement's administration is a matter of common concern to the millions of residents and related countries.</p>
<p>The proposal to change the number of seats on the Council dates back to 1936 and was initiated by the Japanese side. However, it has not been successful for several years. When the list of candidates was submitted last spring, the Japanese side took the lead in changing the past practice, increasing the number of candidates from two to five, and at the same time making every effort to campaign. A very tense situation ensued. However, as a result of the public will of the vast majority of voters, the original allocation of five British, two Japanese, and two American seats was maintained with only minor changes. At that time, the Japanese community had already stepped up preparations for the coming year. This year, the surface competition was not intense at first. However, there have been frequent back-channel contacts for a long time. As the list was delayed and the election period was repeatedly postponed, the residents felt a subtle unease in the midst of a precarious environment. According to the results of the negotiations disclosed the night before last, the number of seats on the board of directors has been completely changed. In addition to the total number increasing from fourteen to eighteen, the allocation of nationalities has been reduced by one for the Chinese, two for the British, and the Japanese desire to increase their number of directors by one has been met. At the same time, the number of American directors has also been increased by one, and a total of three directors have been added from Germany and other countries. It is rumored that the compromise process lasted nearly a month before this result was achieved. It is conceivable that the parties involved went to great lengths, and Mr. Fessenden's tactful statement is sufficient to show one aspect of his painstaking efforts. Considering the current situation, the administrative organization of the Shanghai Settlement should not be changed lightly, even Mr. Fessenden does not deny this. Is this change more beneficial or harmful than the "possibility of disputes and conflicts arising from holding elections"? And after the change, will we obtain, as Mr. Fessenden said, "a more comfortable atmosphere" and make some "urgent and important issues easier to deal with"? This is something that everyone cannot help but reserve their greatest doubts about.</p>
<p>The cause for concern about the future situation lies not only in the change in the proportion of seats on the board of directors, but also in the fact that once the legal barrier is breached, it will inevitably lead to more coveting and trouble in the future. What the Japanese side is fighting for is only the number of seats on the surface, but its intention is actually to control administrative and management power, and the increase in the number of directors is just the first step in this attempt to control. How the future of the Settlement will evolve still depends on how various factors develop in the future, and it cannot be hastily concluded that the change in the number of seats on the board of directors will have any decisive effect on the Settlement. However, unless there are special measures to prevent the brewing of various further developments in the future, the preservation of the current status of the Settlement will become even more difficult. Even from the perspective of the Shanghai Municipal Council itself, after this change, there will be several new problems arising: With regard to the current proportion of seats for foreign directors, the United Kingdom and the United States have a total of six directors, while Japan has three and Germany has one. Compared with the previous situation of the United Kingdom and the United States having seven and Japan having two, the increase and decrease in the ratio is subtly meaningful, this is one. The nationality of the other two directors has not yet been specified, but the Japanese side will definitely make every effort to obtain their assistance as much as possible, and a situation that can counterbalance the United Kingdom and the United States may therefore arise; it is rumored that Mr. Whitler, a Swiss national who previously published the so-called "Shanghai Reform Plan" and was the protagonist of a certain case, has become the target of the Japanese side, this is two. The number of Chinese directors has been reduced from five to four, and whether or not it can obtain the consent of the Chinese government is still a major question, and the position of these fewer Chinese directors will likely become an even more important target, and the situation of the Chinese directors themselves will become increasingly difficult, this is three. The position of Chairman is of great importance. In addition to his various powers, according to regulations, whenever the number of votes on both sides is equal during a meeting, the decision will be made by the Chairman's vote; now the number of seats for the United Kingdom and the United States is only equal to half of the total number of directors other than the Chinese directors, and the Chairman's position can actually influence the trend of the board of directors, this is four.</p>
<p>How to stabilize Shanghai is the common request of millions of residents here, both Chinese and foreign. The change in the number of seats on the board of directors violates the will of the vast majority of residents and the request to maintain the status quo of Shanghai, and it also goes against the consistent policy of the Chinese, British, and American authorities of not allowing changes to the status quo of Shanghai. Whether in terms of legal principles or in terms of facts, it cannot but be regarded as a major regret. Now the relevant countries will make various considerations and decisions on this, which is worthy of attention.</p>
<h3>Newly Appointed US Ambassador to China, Gauss, to Take Office; Expected to Arrive in the Capital in Early May; He Expresses Confidence in China's Future</h3>
<p>Washington, D.C. - The newly appointed US Ambassador to China, Mr. Gauss, is about to take office. He recently told the Central News Agency reporter at the State Department that he has unwavering confidence in China's national future, and firmly believes that today's difficulties will be overcome one by one, and that the strength of the country in the future will be even greater than in the past. He has stayed in China for a total of 27 years, and has many friends among the Chinese government authorities. He said that he is extremely happy to return to his old place, and his feelings cannot be expressed in words. He is a person who admires China extremely enthusiastically, and hopes that he can still stay in China when a glorious peace is established in the future. It is also learned that Mr. Gauss plans to visit Secretary of State Hull and then travel to California next week to reunite with his family. Around the third week of April, he will take the clipper via Manila, Hong Kong, and Chongqing, and will arrive in the capital in early May.

<h3>Yugoslav National Unity – Safeguarding Independence and Integrity</h3>
<p>London - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that the policy adopted by the new Yugoslav government is clearly to maintain peace and maintain close friendly relations with all neighboring countries, while focusing on maintaining its political independence and territorial integrity. Although the Tripartite Pact has not yet been abandoned, it is being studied very carefully. If the terms of the pact conflict with Yugoslavia's policy, the new government may declare the signature of the former Prime Minister invalid. However, the German side obviously does not want to listen to Yugoslav Prime Minister Simović's explanation of this pact. Given the repeated statements of the Axis powers, the Axis does not allow neutrality. A country is either a member of the Axis or against the Axis, there is no such thing as neutrality. Therefore, Germany's attitude towards Yugoslavia will force Yugoslavia to succumb to the Axis or face the consequences of refusal. The German propaganda against Yugoslavia is now the same as that used by Germany before it seized Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. While this is noteworthy, what Germany must now deal with is a government that has risen to power amid popular resentment against slavery. It is unlikely that the German side will be able to divide the three nations of Serbia, Croatia, and Slovenia. Croats have always favored democracy and opposed dictatorship, and the recent military victories of the Allied powers and the attitude of the United States have revived public opinion in the Balkans.

<p>Yugoslavia - Sources in Zagreb said yesterday that Italy, in an effort to avoid war with Yugoslavia, wants to mediate the German-Yugoslav dispute.

The Croatian Peasant Party of Yugoslavia held a day-long meeting yesterday, and the party's vice chairman, Maček, told newspaper editors that Croatia would henceforth leave three leaders to reside in the capital, so Italy's desire to avoid the losses of war by proposing mediation coincides with the Croatian leaders' residing in the capital.

<h3>British Planes Night Raid Emden – Use Giant Bombs – Unparalleled Bombing – British Clacton-on-Sea Area – 2,000 Killed and Injured in Air Raid Last Month</h3>
<p>London - The terrible destruction suffered by Emden, a German industrial center, during a British air force night raid on Monday, can be seen in the report of the British Air Ministry Intelligence Department. According to the report, the bombs carried by British planes in the night raid were enormous and incredibly powerful, unlike the ordinary bombs used by British and German air forces. The first British plane to arrive in Emden dropped a batch of incendiary bombs, causing three fires in the center of the city. The fires illuminated the streets, making them an ideal target for central aircraft to drop bombs. Its observers said that as soon as a giant bomb fell, a flash of white light was seen, and fragments flew high into the air. Apparently ordinary rubble fragments proved that it had been seriously damaged, and the fragments flew high and fell for a long time, indicating that the explosive power was strong. Another observer said that the bomb fell as if an entire house had been blown into the air. According to a driver who had been to 30 attacks, the giant bomb emitted an unprecedentedly huge flash of light when it fell, dazzling his eyes. As the British plane hovered over the city and was about to leave, it saw the fire burning more and more fiercely. The German side was also impressed by the power of the British planes, so its communique acknowledged that "the houses suffered relatively serious damage." (Reuters Dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Collapse of the Italian East African Empire Not Far Off – Capital of Eritrea Falls – Red Sea Port of Massawa Threatened</h3>
<p>Cairo - Last night, officials here announced that the British Imperial Army had captured Asmara, the capital of Eritrea. After the British troops entered the city, a representative of the civil administration, accompanied by an Italian officer carrying a white flag, went to the British military headquarters in the car and surrendered the city. From Keren to Asmara, the roads were littered with abandoned firearms, ammunition, clothing, and food, which showed the panic of the Italian troops retreating. After the British troops captured Keren, with the assistance of the air force, they pursued and suppressed the Italian troops who had lost their will to fight. In just five days, they advanced 75 miles and achieved a great victory. Now they have opened the way to directly take Massawa (the last Italian port on the Red Sea), the Italian military base 55 miles away. Once this port is captured, the Eritrean campaign can be concluded. The British troops spent a great deal of effort in attacking Keren. In the harsh conditions of the country's weather and rugged mountains, they launched a fierce attack for two weeks before capturing it last Thursday. However, the army did not rest, and continued to pursue. The land they passed through was steep, making it difficult for the army to march. After only five days, they captured Asmara again. The advance can be described as rapid. Now that Asmara has fallen, the problem of protecting the safety of non-combatant Italians (including women and children) encountered by Italian Commander Ostellani is becoming increasingly difficult. The British troops' capture of the Eritrean capital not only poses a direct threat to Massawa, 75 miles away, but will also eventually cut off all traffic between Abyssinia and Massawa. At that time, Abyssinia's connection with the Red Sea will only be possible through Assab. Asmara is located on a plateau 7,600 feet above sea level and has a population of 100,000, half of whom are Italians. (Reuters Dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Italian Troops in Albania Trapped</h3>
<p>Vichy - The Italian troops who withdrew from Harrar and Dire Dawa are reported to have used the French railway to flee towards Addis Ababa, and have caused considerable damage to the railway to prevent the British troops from pursuing them. The Italian troops destroyed the property in their second grain storage center, Dire Dawa. Dire Dawa was once the terminus of the railway, and the Italian high command had changed the use of the place as one of the grain storage centers, with its importance second only to Addis Ababa. According to reliable sources here, the station and other railway buildings are full of grain, ammunition, and gasoline. The Italian troops' withdrawal from the area is actually a loss of the most valuable air force base in the center of Albania. The area has now been used by the British Air Force. The Italian troops in Abyssinia have now been isolated from the rest of the world for 48 hours. They now have no way to open up reinforcements. They are now in a state of encirclement, and their military situation will be further complicated by the disturbance of the natives who have not been completely conquered in the area. (United Press Dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Italian Regime Controlled by Nazis</h3>
<p>Boston - Davis, the Rome correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor, has returned here after being expelled by the Italian authorities. It is said that since the British defeated the Italian troops in Africa and the Mediterranean, the domestic regime in Italy has been almost completely under Nazi control. At present, the power in Italy is not in the hands of the military, as most people imagine, but is actually in the hands of the German secret police. This change had already occurred when I left Italy in late February. The Germans have a good chance of winning, because they are carrying out their plans very secretly. Most Italians are still in the dark. The infiltration of German forces into Italy had already shown signs before Italy joined the war. The German secret police seized the opportunity of the Italian military collapse and gradually realized their plan. (Omitted) Mussolini knows this, but there is no way to save it. Mussolini is now Germany's best friend in Italy and still hopes that the final victory of the Nazis will be his only chance of self-salvation. The current situation is not that Mussolini's regime has come to an end, but that the Nazis hold the real power. As far as the German side is concerned, Mussolini's continued stay in power is not much different from their direct occupation. (Reuters Dispatch, 2nd)</p>

The British consul here said that Brooke-Popham's trip was not official. Brooke-Popham's Chief of Staff, fear, and other senior officials, as well as US naval officers, all declined to comment on this meeting, but they all unofficially acknowledged the importance of this meeting.

<p>Manila - Far East Commander-in-Chief Marshal Brooke-Popham visited US Asiatic Fleet Commander Admiral Hart today for consultations.

<h3>Anglo-American Shipping Negotiations in Progress, Blockade Policy Not Relaxed</h3>

The British government has no intention of relaxing its general blockade policy. It is reported that Germany is greatly affected by the British blockade and is currently experiencing a severe shortage of rubber, copper, nickel, wool, and raw materials.

If German refineries and synthetic oil factories continue to be heavily bombed, and the eastern Mediterranean remains dominated by the British Navy, Germany will face serious oil supply difficulties by the end of this year.

<h3>US Officially Announces Guardianship of French Merchant Ships, Rejection of German-Italian Demands Expected, South America Also Detains Axis Vessels</h3>
<p>Washington - Germany and Italy have demanded that the United States immediately release the Axis ships and sailors it has detained. At the same time, according to the State Department, 25 of the 28 Italian ships detained have been damaged by saboteurs, and one of the two German ships detained has also been damaged. A senior Treasury official also stated that the United States has placed 19 French merchant ships under guardianship, including the "Normandie," the world's second-largest ship at 83,423 tons. Well-informed circles believe this is a prelude to seizure. It is understood that Germany and Italy's reason for demanding the release of the detained ships is that there is no provision for such guardianship in international law, and there is no explicit provision in US law. At the same time, officials stated that this detention may be a prelude to requisitioning ships to serve in the US merchant marine. This belief is now deepening, and the United States has shown in various ways that it will disregard German and Italian protests and continue to take action against the detained sailors. Secretary of State Hull stated that he has not yet studied the German and Italian demands, and has not even decided whether the State Department should respond. He also stated that this demand will not be published for the time being. Hull also said that Italy has not responded to the US request to close the Italian consulates in Newark and Detroit. Hull declined to discuss what actions might follow. Hull said that since the United States took guardianship action, the sinking or burning of Axis ships off the coast of Latin America has fully demonstrated the US attitude. (AP, 2nd)</p>
<p>Washington - The United States began prosecuting German and Italian sailors yesterday for attempting to sabotage Axis ships in US ports.

<p>Berlin - A Havas correspondent learned from well-informed sources that the German government will issue a statement in the near future regarding the confiscation of German ships in North American ports. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Berlin - An authoritative source stated yesterday that the US seizure of German and Italian ships was an "absolute violation of human rights." It is wrong for the US to try to justify the takeover as just based on this. The source also stated that there was no news of Germany and Italy demanding the release of ships and sailors from the US.

<h3>Peruvian Warships Pursue German Ships</h3>
<p>Callao, Peru - Three German freighters were burned in Peruvian ports, and two others escaped. The German freighters Leipzig, 5,898 tons, and Monserrat, 5,578 tons, were both loaded with cotton and were attempting to export it when they were intercepted by a Peruvian cruiser.

<h3>German Warships Lie in Wait, Attempt to Escort</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina - The 26 German and Italian ships docked in Argentine ports were yesterday under "special guard." The government authorities may take them over, but the authorities are also considering other measures and do not intend to detain them immediately. (International, 2nd)</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina - It is believed that three or four German warships are gathering in the South Atlantic, intending to act as an escort fleet for Axis ships escaping from US ports. However, all escape attempts have failed. In Guayaquil, the German ship San Ligo, upon hearing that the authorities were about to confiscate the ship, set itself on fire. In Venezuela, the Italian oil tankers Trottilla, Gulepha-Saint-Ursin, De-La-Sarillo, and the German freighter Sisstris were all scuttled.

Both spoke English, so no interpreter was used. What was discussed has not been announced. According to people in the Vatican, the Pope has no intention of involving himself in the political issues "being discussed in the international diplomatic arena." His actions are based entirely on moral, spiritual, and religious concepts. According to Matsuoka, after the meeting he told reporters that his conversation with the Pope had a "special flavor," and he felt deeply the Pope's great personality. (Havas, 2nd)</p>

It is rumored that Matsuoka has largely determined Japan's actions in the East once the war expands. It is generally believed that the conversation must have involved the Soviet Union, and Matsuoka's conversation with Stalin and his stopover in Moscow on his way back to Japan were even more important points of the conversation. However, it is said that the conversation mainly focused on the issues of the United States and Yugoslavia. (AP, 2nd)</p>

<h3>US Actively Aiding Democratic Nations, Begins Distributing Military Materials, Roosevelt Attaches Great Importance to Corley Report, Commentators Believe US Will Enter War in Two Months</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt returned to the White House yesterday and immediately began allocating military materials to the armies of the United States, Britain, and other democratic countries. The President's work is based on the reference provided by Hopkins, the President's recent special envoy to Britain, who plays a very important role in the allocation of materials. (AP, 2nd)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt stated that he has read the two-volume report of Corley, the representative to China, and believes that the content is very important. The reporter asked him for a more detailed criticism or explanation of this report, but Roosevelt refused. The President also told reporters that the government has begun to implement the plan to aid the Allies. The four departments of the Navy, Army, Treasury, and Agriculture have approved a plan for foreign governments resisting aggression to obtain goods worth 1,080,000,000 US dollars from the United States. These funds will be disbursed from the 7 billion US dollar item passed by Congress. The goods that foreign governments can obtain include land, air force vehicles, agriculture and various other materials. (Special dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt stated yesterday that he had allocated 1,080,000,000 US dollars to purchase defense materials and food to aid Britain and other democratic countries at war. At the same time, the Senate unanimously passed the Fifth National Defense Supplemental Appropriations Bill of 4,389,000,000 US dollars. The funds listed in the bill are for the procurement of new army bombers, naval equipment, artillery, and the construction of defenses on bases leased from Britain. The bill has been sent to the House of Representatives for review due to numerous amendments in the Senate. The President stated that the huge amount of funds he has newly allocated has been allocated from the 7 billion US dollar aid fund, which is the fund passed by Congress for the purpose of the Lend-Lease Act. He also stated that the four departments of the Navy, Army, Treasury, and Agriculture have all placed new orders worth 1,080,000,000 US dollars, including the needs of the Navy and Army, aviation materials, automobiles, agricultural products, and other items, and a portion of which is intended to aid Greece. However, the President refused to discuss the two issues of whether the existing military supplies of the Navy and Army should be transferred to Britain first and whether US ships should escort the military supplies during transportation. (AP, 2nd)</p>
<p>Washington - The State Department has just released statistics that the total value of US ordnance and ammunition exports in February of this year was 132,729,000 US dollars, of which 118,046,000 US dollars were shipped to Britain, and the remainder was shipped to China, the Dutch East Indies, Greece, Mexico, the Belgian Congo, and other countries. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>New York - Great commentators Kressel and Philin-Mus stated yesterday that the United States is racing against the war and may resort to force in 60 days. The United States must escort and transport goods to supply Britain. Germany will inevitably attack the ships. The United States is now taking a path that is not conducive to war, and its effect can greatly reduce the amount of bloodshed. Well-informed sources believe that the United States will escort goods to Britain in the short term. This move requires a great deal of courage on the part of the government, because the danger is too great and most people still do not approve of it. But Roosevelt clearly believes that the people's love of peace should not hinder the plan for overall victory. Confiscating Axis ships will probably be used by Britain. This is just one precursor to the incident. It can now be stated that the United States may be involved in the war around the end of June. Roosevelt has given Britain and the world a pledge to defeat Hitler. The two are each driving a train, racing on the track of war. There will be a day of collision. Everyone believes that if the United States delivers goods to Britain, it cannot but use the Navy and Air Force. Germany's shooting is a matter of course. (AP, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Social Situation Deteriorating</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to people in police circles, after three and a half years of war with China, Japan's social situation has been affected in terms of morality and physical condition. Young people are the worst. Many young people are becoming increasingly decadent and unaware of the country's urgent needs. They commit crimes frequently and are shameless. Although this situation was previously discovered in all belligerent countries during the European War, it is trending downwards. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Changes in the Composition of the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department: All Parties Are Closely Watching, Believing It Is Insufficient to Satisfy Chinese Expectations, and a Temporary Solution Will Be Difficult to Sustain for Long</h3>
<p>Shanghai Hua Guo He Ye She Chong, Telegraph on the 2nd: The press here today severely criticized the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC)'s attempt to compromise with Japan and vehemently opposed the proposal to change the number of directors. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment on the proposal to reorganize the board of directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council because it had not yet reviewed the contents of the new plan. However, the Chinese side generally opposed the plan, believing that this move was an act of compromise, which not only failed to satisfy Japan's desire for greater management power in the International Settlement but would also encourage Japan to make further demands. Before 1937, although China had repeatedly made concessions to Japan, it still failed to stop Japan.</p>
<p>Unanimous Expectation: Handle with Caution</p>
<p>The English-language *China Press* stated: "In an atmosphere of unprecedented terrorism, the Shanghai Municipal Council, unable to withstand the threats and oppression of the Japanese, has succumbed to the Japanese. This decision by the Municipal Council to sacrifice the Chinese to please the Japanese sets a very dangerous precedent. Mr. Fessenden, the Director-General and Chairman of the Municipal Council, said that the Municipal Council wanted to seek a temporary solution, but the proposed solution will never achieve its goal and will only exacerbate the dissatisfaction within the settlement. Because Chinese residents constitute the vast majority, reducing their representation will not win their goodwill. Compromise will only increase Japan's desires and allow the Japanese to further encroach." The *Shishi Xinbao* reported: "This change is clearly a manifestation of the Municipal Council's appeasement policy. This method is essentially an ostrich policy, not only unwise but also very dangerous. Only firm and effective measures can stop Japan's extravagant hopes and deeply affect the interests of the countries concerned. We hope that the Municipal Council authorities will handle this situation with caution."</p>
<p>British, American, and Japanese Consuls-General Continue Negotiations</p>
<p>According to sources yesterday, "After the news that the Municipal Council would increase the number of German directors by one and the number of directors of other nationalities by two, Portugal, which has a large number of expatriates in Shanghai, is expected to obtain one director's seat, and the other seat will be held by expatriates from Switzerland or Scandinavian countries. As for the rumors that the relevant parties have reached a consensus on the director allocation method, it is heard that the Consular Body has not yet formally received the redistribution proposal agreed upon by the British, American, and Japanese Consuls-General as of yesterday, but it is believed that negotiations are still ongoing, and the parties concerned will definitely reach an agreement in the near future."</p>
<p>Various Parties Vie for the Remaining Two Seats</p>
<p>It was also said that "Someone has put forward an informal proposal that the European countries will be given two seats on the Municipal Council Board of Directors, one for countries occupied by Germany and the other for countries not occupied by Germany. If this method is realized, Portuguese expatriates can obtain one director's seat, and the other seat will be held by Dutch expatriates or expatriates from Scandinavian countries. What is worrying is that if a director is appointed from a country occupied by Germany, the German side may be able to exert pressure on him. Therefore, there is a proposal that the Swiss expatriates should hold one of the seats, because the Swiss expatriates also have a considerable number of industries in Shanghai." The reporter also asked whether Russian expatriates in Shanghai, who are second only to Japanese expatriates in number, should be given a seat. The well-informed person replied that when the relevant parties discussed the election issue, they did not pay attention to the Russian expatriates alone because most of the Russian expatriates live in the French Concession. Yesterday, the reporter also inquired about this issue from the Portuguese expatriates, who said that the Portuguese expatriate representatives had informally applied for a director's seat and would do their best to achieve their goal. The number of Portuguese expatriates in Shanghai is no less than 3,000, and they really have the right to enjoy this kind of right.</p>
<p>Development Trends Cannot Be Predicted</p>
<p>Officials of the English-language *North China Daily News* refused to express their opinions on this year's election issue this morning. An official said, "No one can predict what developments will occur in the election issue." And refused to release the list of candidates received by the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>The Main Culprit in the Theft Case Also Attempts to Run for Election</p>
<p>Hulbert, the protagonist of the 3 million copper ingot case, announced yesterday that he intends to participate in this year's Municipal Council director election and has decided that his election slogan will be "Oppose High Taxes." Hulbert said that if Shanghai needs him, he is willing to serve it. Hulbert did not mention whether the Swiss Consul-General in Shanghai, Fontanel, agreed to Hulbert's decision to participate in the election. Hulbert said that he grew up in Shanghai and witnessed Shanghai transform from a small town into a prosperous metropolis, so he believes he can help it overcome its current difficulties.</p>
<p>Decision to Hold a Special Meeting First</p>
<p>The *North China Herald* reported that the Danish Consul-General and Doyen of the Consular Body, Mr. Hille, at the request of the Municipal Council, has issued a notice in accordance with Article 15 of the Yangjingbang Land Regulations, setting a special meeting of taxpayers at 2:30 pm on April 17th at the Grandstand of the Racecourse to pass new articles of association and amendments to the existing articles of association. The resolution will be proposed by the Chairman of the Municipal Council, Mr. Cornfoot, and seconded by Mr. Mitchell, a director. It is understood that the special meeting of taxpayers will be held on the same day as the annual general meeting of taxpayers, but the special meeting of taxpayers will be held first.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Departs Shanghai for Chongqing</h3>
<p>Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, arrived in Shanghai by boat with his wife and others on the 4th of last month, and stayed at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund. He went to the embassy every day to handle official business, made plans for the withdrawal of British expatriates from the occupied areas and the dredging of Shanghai's coal sources, and summoned George, the British Consul-General in Shanghai, and others to inquire in detail. After staying in Shanghai for a month, he was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai at the end of last month, but due to unfinished official business, he postponed his departure. He has now completed his official business in Shanghai and left Shanghai by boat at 8 pm the day before yesterday to go to Hong Kong, and then flew to Chongqing to maintain close contact with the Chinese government. The ambassador's entourage was very simple, only his private secretary, Mr. MacKenzie, and others accompanied him. The ambassador's wife will stay in Shanghai for the time being, residing in a private residence on Dunxin Road, and will go to Chile to visit relatives in the near future.</p>
<h3>Harvard Alumni Association Held Its Annual Meeting Last Night, Unanimously Wishing Friend Roosevelt Good Health in His Administration</h3>
<p>The Harvard University Shanghai Alumni Association held its annual meeting at the American Club on Fuzhou Road last night. The school has been established for more than 300 years and is a famous university of the current era, with a large number of talented people.

<h3>It Is Rumored That the Italian Ship Conte Verde Will Sail to Japan Covertly: British Naval Authorities Are Closely Monitoring, but the Italian Shipping Company Resolutely Denies It</h3>
<p>The British naval authorities in Shanghai are still closely monitoring the actions of the Italian ship *Conte Verde* yesterday. According to a certain international law authority yesterday, if the ship sails out of the territorial waters of a neutral country, British warships can treat it as a prize of war and take it over. If the Italian ship refuses, the British army can sink it. However, officials of the Italian Mail Steamship Company refused to comment on the future actions of the ship when they met with reporters yesterday. However, they believed that the rumor in Shanghai newspapers that the ship would sail to Japan was absurd. Since the outbreak of war between Britain and Italy, the ship has been docked in the Huangpu River. The workers on the ship were still busy washing the cabins and scraping off the mud on both sides yesterday. It is heard that the general manager of the Italian Mail Steamship Company is now stranded in Japan and has not returned to Shanghai for a long time. It is impossible to confirm whether this is related to the ship sailing to Japan.</p>
<p>Adding Fuel, Obviously Making Preparations</p>
<p>The *Continental Times* reported that the Italian mail ship *Conte Verde*, which was stranded in Shanghai, was preparing to leave here late yesterday night, but as of 1:00 am today (the 2nd), the ship was still moored in the Huangpu River near Yangshupu Lan Road. The *Conte Verde* was filling up with water and fuel all day yesterday, obviously making final preparations for departure. It is said that the ship will sail to Kobe at high tide between midnight and 2:00 am tonight, equipped with weapons, to engage in piracy.</p>
<p>German Ships Reportedly Escorted by Japanese Warships</p>
<p>Also, when the German ship *Ramses*, which left Shanghai late Saturday night or Sunday morning, arrived at the mouth of the Wusong River, it was escorted by about two Japanese destroyers to Kobe, where it was equipped and converted into a supply ship to supply the pirate ships. People here point out that the increasing activity of Axis ships in the Far East is reminiscent of the rumors that the Italian gunboat *Eritrea* had already arrived in Kobe on March 23.</p>
<p>All Italian Ship Crew Members Retained</p>
<p>Also, the *Shanghai Times* reported that it was unable to obtain confirmation from port authorities or other sources regarding the secret preparations of the Italian Mail Steamship Company's giant ship *Conte Verde* or its impending departure. According to reports, after Italy joined the war last spring, the ship was stranded in the upper reaches of the Huangpu River in Pudong, and it is believed that all of its crew members have been retained and are serving on the ship.</p>
<h3>Interest Rates Reduced by the Bankers' Association Starting Yesterday: Idle Funds Still Abundant, Difficulty Finding Outlets for Deposits</h3>
<p>Regarding the fact that the Joint Reserve Committee of the banking industry will appropriately reduce the deposit interest rates of various banks and firms starting on April 1, the reporter of the *Xin Sheng She* specifically inquired about everything from the committee yesterday. A certain gentleman of the committee told us that the deposits of various exchange banks and other banks and firms in the committee are part of the daily operating funds of each of those banks and firms. Its purpose is to facilitate the daily collection and settlement of bills. Because our country's commercial interest rate was originally higher than that of foreign countries, the financial industry has always given interest on interbank deposits to provide some financial support. The level of interbank deposit interest rates of the committee must be determined by the tightness of the money market and the agent collection and settlement bank at any time. The committee handled bill exchange matters in March of the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e. 1933], at which time both taels and dollars were still in use. The initial interest rate for clearing house deposits was 2% per year for taels and 1% per year for dollars. Later, the clearing house dollar deposit interest rate was changed to 1.5% per year. Since the Incident [i.e., the start of the Sino-Japanese War], the Shanghai money market has been tighter. In the spring of the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1938], the foreign exchange control was implemented, and there was a phenomenon of capital flight in Shanghai. The money market tightened, and the committee increased the clearing house deposits of various banks and firms from the original 1.5% per year to 2% per month in November of that year, and then increased it to 3% per year in December. In the autumn of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1939], the European War broke out, and idle funds gathered in</p>
<p>Shanghai from all over the world, and this became even worse in the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1940]. Therefore, the committee slightly reduced the deposit interest rates of various banks and firms in November of the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1940]. The interest rate for exchange banks was 2% per year, and the interest rate for other banks and firms was 1.75% per year. However, the situation of abundant idle funds is still becoming more serious. The committee believes that on the one hand, the interest burden has increased compared to before, and on the other hand, the channels for investment are still felt to be narrow. Therefore, the committee will separately determine the interest-bearing limit for the clearing house deposits of each bank and firm. Within the limit, the deposit interest rate for exchange banks has been changed to 1.5% per year, and the deposit interest rate for other industry peers has been changed to 1.25% per year. No interest will be paid on deposits exceeding the limit. Although the interest rate has been slightly reduced again, it is actually the same as the pre-war interest rate. Mr. Wang Shenfu, a prominent businessman in the city, recently visited the Xin Pu Yu Tang [New Universal Fosterage Hall] with his wife and children and asked to distribute the 2,000 loaves of bread he brought. Hundreds of orphans, the elderly, and the weak were all smiles and thanked him repeatedly. Mr. Wang had donated a large sum of money and had made special achievements in soliciting donations from relatives and friends, benefiting the poor and sick, which is commendable. The donations received by the hall are recorded as follows: Xie Sheng Oil Firm, Wu Zhilin, Rui He Hao, Ju Shun Oil Firm, Feng Ji, Lan Ji, Jin Ji, Bei Tong Yu, Qia Da, Yuan Da, Jun Tai, Wan Sen Yu, each donated one can of oil, Yuan Yu donated one basket of dried salted radish, the Shanghai Charity Group donated 300 yuan, Chen Jueping donated 200 yuan, Liu Jingchen and Liu Fangchen of the Wanguo Pharmacy each donated 100 yuan, Zhu Jixiang donated 100 yuan for his deceased mother's memorial day, an anonymous person donated 10 yuan, Mr. Wang Shenfu solicited donations of 500 yuan from Chen Hansha and Pu Zhiliang, Chen Hansha solicited donations of 500 yuan from Yuan Maosheng Cotton Cloth Shop, Zhou Sensheng and Zhang Chi each donated 100 yuan, Da De Xin Oil Press and Xinhua Peppermint Company each donated 300 yuan, He Ji and Qiu Jingliang each donated 50 yuan, an anonymous person donated 5 yuan, Jin Shenren donated 3 yuan, and the Cosmic Pharmaceutical Factory donated medicines worth 500 yuan. Tong Yu Salt Industry Company donated 5 dan of salt, and An Tai Hao donated two bags of soybeans and ten bags of rice.</p>
<h3>Tao Guangchuan Can Be Released on Bail Soon: The Police Station Is Now at Ease</h3>
<p>Tao Guangchuan, the principal of Lequn Middle School at No. 970 Avenue du Roi Albert, was suddenly searched by certain personnel, accompanied by Western police, in the principal's office on the 28th of last month. In the end, nothing was found. Before leaving, Tao was arrested. It has been a week since he was detained at the Central Police Station. His family has visited the police station twice. Tao is very at ease inside. It is now known that Tao is still being detained at the police station. The police station also believes that Tao usually concentrates on education and has no other activities, so he will probably be released on bail.</p>
<h3>Announcement of Members of the Shipping Committee: Shipping Rangoon Rice to Shanghai, Monthly Quota of More Than 15,000 Tons, Rice to Be Sold Only to Licensed Rice Shops</h3>

The members of the committee are Sun Ruihuang, Lan Rong, Mr. Halle, Mr. Melo, and Mr. Nasi.</p>
<p>Shipping Negotiations Probably Already Underway</p>
<p>According to people close to the Public Works Department, the authorities have no difficulty in obtaining the necessary rice transport ships and are expected to have started charter negotiations with several shipping companies in the city. After the bureau announced the rice transport plan last Friday, it received enthusiastic responses from all parties and must have decided to fully implement its plan. Also, well-informed sources said yesterday that the hope of obtaining more national rice has vanished, because although "the city" [i.e. the Shanghai Municipal Government] has repeatedly promised, its position cannot provide assistance to the two concessions.</p>
<p>Restricting Sales: Three Methods</p>
<p>Also, according to another credible source, the method of controlling the rice market was proposed by the authorities of the French Concession. The detailed regulations will probably be announced by the authorities of the two concessions at the same time today. It is heard that after the implementation of this method, any rice merchant who orders foreign rice from abroad must first register with the concession authorities, otherwise they will not be allowed to sell it in Shanghai. Those who register in advance will be charged by the concession authorities with the production price, plus freight, insurance, and legal profits, and will be responsible for selling it in various rice shops, so as to eliminate hoarding and speculation. According to Mr. Mingside, the following items must be complied with when transferring the Public Works Department's ships to transport rice: (1) The rice imported by them must be sold to 665 licensed rice shops in the British and French concessions. (2) Only Grade 3 rice can be transported, and high-quality rice cannot be transported. (3) This type of imported rice must be sold in retail and can be freely resold without obtaining a certificate, but each time it must not exceed 5 pounds or 10 pounds. Mr. Ming concluded that those who violate the above regulations will be prohibited from making further decisions on goods.</p>
<h3>Trade Associations Throughout the City Send Telegrams to Mao Zedong, etc.: Deeply Hope to Stop Before It Is Too Late, Abide by Promises, and Work Together to Complete the Great Cause of Resistance and Reconstruction</h3>
<p>Since the Incident [i.e., the start of the Sino-Japanese War], China has relied on the unity and hard work of the people throughout the country to lay the foundation for the final victory. Unexpectedly, at this time when the dawn is in sight and the great cause is about to be accomplished, the Communist Party, regardless of the nation's survival, goes back on its word and sabotages the resistance and reconstruction, causing public outrage among the people throughout the country. Various public groups and associations in the city have successively sent telegrams urging it not to become a sinner of the ages. It is now known that the trade associations of various industries throughout the city, affiliated with the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, also sent telegrams to Mao Zedong, etc., yesterday. The original text is extracted as follows:</p>
<p>Support the Government and Work Together to Resist the Enemy</p>
<p>Yan'an Telegram to Councilor Mao Zedong and transfer to Chen Shaoyu, Qin Bangxian, Lin Zuhan, Wu Yuzhang, Dong Biwu, Deng Yingchao, Gentlemen: Since the publication of your party's declaration in the 26th year of the Republic [i.e. 1937], supporting the government and working together to resist the enemy, the people throughout the country have deeply sympathized and taken notice. This is because you have given up the private disputes of one party and one class, and are willing to work hard for national liberation. In short, you have gained the hearts of the people by fulfilling your oaths and seeking truth from facts.</p>
<p>Going Back on Promises and Sabotaging Resistance and Reconstruction</p>
<p>After four years of hard fighting and the dawn is in sight, it is time to unite as one, make persistent efforts, and strive for the final victory. Gentlemen, you suddenly submitted so-called follow-up measures and temporary solutions that are enough to shake the foundation of the country, as tools to pressure attendance in the current session of the People's Political Council because of the government's disbanding of the New Fourth Army. From the standpoint of your party, this is a betrayal of promises. From the standpoint of the overall situation, this is a sabotage of resistance and reconstruction. What day is today? How can we allow the re-emergence of infighting? Gentlemen, is this not making the enemy rejoice and the loved ones grieve?</p>
<p>Attacking Friendly Troops and Expanding Troops Indiscriminately</p>
<p>In the past few years, the New Fourth Army in Jiangsu, Anhui, and other provinces has often been heard attacking friendly troops and not fighting the enemy, expanding troops indiscriminately, doing nothing but demanding food from the people and encroaching on defense zones, purely to expand territory, and still saying that this is a democratic politics, exerting all the power of propaganda, as if the eyes and ears of the people of the country are blind and deaf, and it is not difficult to deceive them all. However, it is not known that the actions of betraying the country and disrupting discipline have been pointed out by the people on both sides of the Yangtze River, and are well known and detailed.</p>
<p>Dividing Unity, Taking Advantage of Danger to Rebel</p>
<p>The government has imposed sanctions to rectify military discipline and strengthen the combat formation. The army deserves it, and the people of the country still regret that it was too slow. Gentlemen, how can you, with your party's selfishness, ignore the black and white and wrongly favor it? It must be known that Heaven sees as the people see, and Heaven hears as the people hear. Right and wrong are as clear as a mirror. At this critical moment, when survival is at stake, any party is supported by the people of the country. On the contrary, those who are afraid of fighting the enemy, brave in private fighting, dividing unity, taking advantage of danger to rebel, using the name of fighting to carry out the reality of rebellion, and aiming at seizing political power, no matter how strong their army is, are the sinners of the nation and the moths of the country. Even if they have a flowery pen and a glib tongue, the result of their propaganda is enough to expose their crimes. Even a three-foot child will not be deceived, let alone bewitch the masses and hope to use them.</p>
<p>The Merchants and People of Shanghai Have Strong Beliefs. Alas, Our Merchants and People of Shanghai, Under Daily Oppression, Endure Humiliation and Prolong Life, Losing Assets and Destroying Families, Without Shaking Slightly, Are Confident of the Inevitable Victory of Resistance and Reconstruction, and Believe That the Cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communists Will Result in Fruitful Warfare, Which Will Be Able to Complete the Integrity of Territory and Sovereignty and the Restoration of the Nation, Thus Lifting Our People Out of Fire and Water and Ascending to Peace. Once We Suddenly Hear That Your Party Has Gone Back on Its Promises and Obstructed the Counter-Offensive of the Great Army, It Is Like a Bolt from the Blue and a Bucket of Cold Water on Our Heads. We Are Truly Filled with the Fear of an Overturned Nest and Grief in Our Hearts, Wanting to Cry but Having No Tears.</p>
<p>Abide by Promises and Work Together in Harmony</p>
<p>We Believe That Gentlemen Are All Talents of the Era and Pillars of the Country, And Have Always Taken It Upon Themselves to Be Foresighted And Have Been Widely Praised and Respected by Society for a Long Time. We Still Hope That You Will Not Indulge in Impulses and Will Value the Nation Above All Else, Quickly Rein in the Horse on the Cliff, Continue the Policy of Clarity and Generosity, Abide by the Previous Promises, and Work Together in Harmony With the Government to Complete the Great Cause of Resistance and Reconstruction. Not Only Will the People's Confidence Be Restored Immediately, but Glorious Achievements Will Be Seen Eternally Recorded in History, Receiving the Admiration of All Ages. Our Trade Associations Throughout Shanghai, In Addition to Asking the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to Express Our Concerns in a Clever Telegram Last Month, Because We Deeply Hope for the Unity of the Kuomintang and the Communists, We Are Not Afraid of Wordiness and Repeatedly Express Our Views in the Hope That You Will Pay Attention. We Ardently Hope and Pray. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and All Trade Associations Throughout the City Bow.</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Commanders Leave Shanghai Hastily</h3>
<p>According to confirmed news in the shipping industry, the Japanese Navy is now attempting to build naval bases in the Zhoushan Islands and the Da Ming Chong [Greater Ming Barrier Reef], and the Japanese merchant ships operating between Shanghai, Zhoushan Dinghai, and Chongming have recently become even more strict in restricting passengers traveling to and from these locations. Since the Nakao Unit of the Japanese Army in Zhoushan Island began constructing roads, they have been quite panicked because they have been repeatedly attacked by Chinese mobile units. The commander of the Japanese fleet stationed in China, Shigitaro Shimada, and the commander of the Japanese Navy in Shanghai, Kobayashi, hastily took a ship from Shanghai to Dinghai the other day to hold a military conference, attempting to defend it to the death. For days, a total of six Japanese warships have been concentrated at the head of Zhoushan Island and the sea off Daishan Island, including a small aircraft carrier. The Chinese coastal defense forces have been strictly monitoring and on guard.</p>
<h3>Floating Mines Discovered in Hong Kong Waters: Customs Issues Maritime Alert</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Port Master notified the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau (i.e., the Customs Port Affairs Section) that, according to a report from the Bao'an ship, floating mines were discovered in the waters of Cheung Chau near Hong Kong. After receiving the report, the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau has issued a maritime alert, ordering all foreign ships traveling on the Nanyang route to pay close attention.</p>
<h3>Electricity Conservation Has No Significant Impact Yet</h3>
<p>The Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Public Works Department reported that the need to conserve electricity last month has had no significant impact on industrial output. This is probably because most factories have only received electricity conservation notices for a week or two. Moreover, the amount to be reduced is 30% of the highest usage within the past thirteen months, so the reduction in recent usage seems to be lower. Therefore, the impact on the industrial sector does not appear to be significant.</p>
<h3>Rumors That Guo Shun Has Left Shanghai Are Inaccurate: Has Not Been in Contact with the Outside World for the Past Few Days, Leading to Widespread Rumors That Mr. Guo Has Gone Elsewhere</h3>
<p>The *Shanghai Evening Post* reported that reliable Chinese sources yesterday (the 1st) said that Guo Shun, a Chinese director of the Public Works Department, has also recently left Shanghai for Hong Kong. After repeated inquiries at Guo's residence on Jing'an Temple Road, the answer received was "Mr. Guo is not at home." It is verified that Guo and the other four Chinese directors have been re-elected by the taxpaying Chinese association, but Yu Qiaqing and Chen Tingrui, two of the Chinese directors, have recently left Shanghai one after another. With Guo Shun leaving, only two Chinese directors remain in Shanghai. The English-language *North China Daily News* said that according to people close to Guo Shun, a Chinese director of the Public Works Department, Guo Shun has not yet left Shanghai, but is expected to leave soon. The outside world has been unable to contact Guo Shun for the past few days, leading to rumors that Mr. Guo has already left Shanghai, but this rumor has recently been refuted.</p>

<h3>Travelers to Hong Kong: Temporary Entry Permits Issued Starting from April 1st</h3>
<p>Since Hong Kong implemented immigration regulations on January 14 of this year, Chinese citizens traveling to Hong Kong must first obtain an entry permit issued by the Hong Kong Immigration Department to enter. Otherwise, they must prepay a cash guarantee to purchase tickets and board the ship. The process of obtaining these entry permits takes time, and the procedures for refunding the guarantee are quite cumbersome, causing hardship for travelers. Recognizing this, the China Travel Service in Shanghai requested special privileges from the Hong Kong Immigration Department to issue temporary entry permits in Shanghai. After several discussions, approval was finally obtained, and issuance began on April 1st. In the future, travelers to Hong Kong who can first complete the permit application at the agency can request the issuance of a temporary entry permit without a cash guarantee and land in Hong Kong with the permit. Its legal effect is no different from that of a formal entry permit. In addition to collecting the prescribed fees for formal entry permits (two types: HK$4 or HK$8), the agency will not charge any additional fees for temporary entry permits.</p>
<h3>Bureau of Industry and Commerce Stipulates: This Year's Subsidies</h3>

<h3>Robbery Notes</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 8:30 AM, four robbers broke into No. 15, Lane 364, North Jiangxi Road, brandishing guns to prevent any outcry. They robbed 5,000 yuan in legal currency and clothing, then fled out the door and disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, two robbers suddenly entered the home of a Westerner named Barden (transliteration) at No. 11, Lane 408, Da Xi Road. One robber drew a pistol and ordered silence. They robbed a gold watch, a camera, a lensometer, and cash totaling over 1,000 yuan before escaping.</p>
<p>The night before last, at around 11:00 PM, six robbers broke into the home of Ningbo native Wu Rongyao at No. 176 Rue Lafayette, one wielding a fake pistol and another holding a sharp blade. They robbed Wu's family of several hundred yuan in property.</p>
<p>They then went to the home of Qian Wenzhi at No. 178 on the same road. One robber used a knife to threaten Qian's wife, Ms. Qian Wang (22 years old). Unexpectedly, the woman fainted in fright and jumped from the window, causing serious injuries. She was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment, where it was reported that her spine was broken, and her condition remains dangerous.</p>

<h3>Food: The Price of Foreign Rice Rises Immediately After Seizure</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign rice rose in the morning and fell in the evening, and the market turned to a spiral trend, but the result was still one or two yuan higher than the previous market. When the market opened early in the morning, after the limit price was virtually cancelled, local merchants eagerly bought up the stock. The hoarding side also publicly released samples, but because demand turned strong, and it was rumored that Ningbo merchants were buying three or five hundred tons of Xiaojiao Yinghua Si in the market to transport to the rice-deficient areas along the Yangtze River, people's hearts were once again stimulated, and those who held goods and general speculators took the opportunity to call up prices, and the market suddenly became prosperous. Currently, the market price of Xiaojiao, which is traded in foreign rice, was sold at 106 yuan as soon as it opened in the morning, and then continued to rise to 107.5 yuan, and the middle price was 106.5 yuan. Other products such as No. 1 Saigon also had a wide range of prices, opening at 112 yuan and 111 yuan, but No. 2 still only opened at 106 or 107 yuan, Tokyo Pojian was priced from 101 yuan, followed by 97.5 yuan, Nianjian was priced at 105 yuan, Milu was priced at 94 yuan, and Suijian was priced at 87 to 88 yuan, followed by 74 to 75 yuan. In short, Xiaojiao was more than three yuan higher than the previous market, and other goods such as No. 1 and No. 2 Saigon only increased by one or two yuan. The original package of Yinghua Si Xiaojiao rice also rose from 125 or 126 yuan to 129 yuan, an increase of three or four yuan compared with the previous day. However, in the afternoon, local merchants stopped buying because they felt the price was too expensive, and the re-export trade was also sufficient, so the sales were stagnant, and many speculators and profiteers sought to sell, so the market returned a little by one or two yuan in the evening, and the market became weak and spiritless. Due to the re-export trade, the total transaction volume for the whole day, including the original package, was 27,000 to 28,000 bags. Yesterday, 3,000 bags of corn were transported to Yantai.</p>
<p>For thick and thin japonica rice and other domestic rice, the general cargo owners saw that the foreign rice was tightening and became more determined to sell, so the market for thin japonica rice was smooth, and the market saw a rebound of one and a half yuan. Qingjiaojiao saw thin rice opening at 110 yuan, followed by 108.5 yuan, but thick japonica rice was unable to compete with thin rice, only showing a stable situation, because the market was full of goods and the sales were not good. Changbang Zhentiejiao still opened at 120 yuan, Gaojing at 118 yuan, Kunshan Gaobaijing at 116 yuan, followed by 109 yuan, and the original package was not opened.</p>
<p>In the environment of glutinous rice, the minds of both buyers and sellers are also prosperous, so not only is the retail appetite quite refreshing, but there are also bulk transactions by large households, and the sellers then became more charming and shouted high, and as a result, the selling price also increased by yuan. Hong Kong Te Wu opened at 106 yuan, the general market was 104 yuan to 102 yuan, followed by 100 yuan, and Nuo Lu Te was priced from 98 yuan, followed by 93 yuan.</p>
<p>More foreign rice has arrived in Shanghai. Yihua Foreign Company's Yusheng Wheel arrived in port at 9:00 PM the night before last (the 1st), carrying 10,264 bags from Hong Kong, and was docked at the Roosevelt Pier to unload. It is said that Xia Laochen Foreign Company's Yongzhen Wheel, managed by Yangzhen, is transporting more than 17,000 bags of foreign rice from Yangon to Shanghai, and is expected to arrive this morning. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Flour Market Does Not Escape Spiral</h3>
<p>The flour market is still stable, and its process must be first weak and then tight, not escaping the state of spiral. Checking the morning opening, because there is a lot of foreign flour in stock, scattered households are seeking to sell with the market, and Jinlong brand Kan flour once loosened to 28.65 yuan, but because the price of rice rose, customers hoarded to absorb at low prices, and the market tightened again, Jinlong flour rebounded to 28.9 yuan, Zhonglou Flower and Bird brand was 29.3 or 4 yuan, and the number of transactions was about nearly 10,000 bags. The price of flat-selling flour has not changed, and 5,872 bags are still supplied by Fuxin Factory, and the rest are supplemented by foreign flour.</p>
<p>The wheat market is quiet in terms of arrival and sales, and the market is stagnant for a long time. The market in Japanese factories must also have no goods to collect, and the market is becoming more and more calm. It is said that the Chinese factories have contacted foreign merchants to order Australian wheat, but in the end, because of the lack of ships, it has not been concluded.</p>
<p>Foreign flour continues to arrive at the port. In addition to carrying a large number of foreign rice from Hong Kong, Yihua Foreign Company's Yusheng Wheel also brought in half a thousand and ninety-one bags of flour, which arrived in Shanghai the night before last (the 1st) and was docked at the Roosevelt Pier to unload. Today, there are 500 bags of flour to be transported to Xiamen, which is the local flour. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Falls, Soybean Cake Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean oil market saw a decline of two or three yuan due to sluggish actual sales and a weary underlying trend. Although the futures oil market was trying to save the situation by hoarders, the general trend was unfavorable to the bulls, and the struggle was in vain. A total of 50 barrels of Dalian oil were traded at a price of 141 yuan, and 1,200 barrels were ordered for delivery in April at a price of 141.25 yuan to 139.5 yuan, and recovered to 140 yuan. 600 barrels were ordered for delivery in late April at a price of 143.5 yuan to 140.05 yuan. Since the short squeeze, the soybean cake market has been tight and rising for a while. Moreover, the inland sales market has recently been inquiring, so in the state of insufficient spot goods, it is even more charming. The market rose once because the bulls had slightly come out the previous day, but the inland route continued to pick up yesterday, and the market turned up again. 3,000 pieces of Jisheng cake were traded at a price of 17.2 yuan to 17.32 yuan, 1,000 pieces of Feizi cake were traded at a price of 17.05 yuan, and 1,000 pieces of Changji cake were ordered for delivery in April at a price of 17.5 yuan.</p>
<p>740 bags of soybeans were exported to Xiamen on the 3rd, and another 120 bags were exported to Hong Kong.</p>

One reason was that foreign exchange lacked rise and fall, and the market was calm, and the other reason was that the commission was increased, and speculators had no intention of starting, and most of them were closing transactions, resulting in a sharp reduction in transactions, accounting for about 10,000 taels, and the price fluctuated between 6,500 yuan and a slight increase of 150 to 60 yuan throughout the day, and the result was 6 yuan, which was 6,563 yuan. The spot market was firm, and initially Xianghe absorbed 200 taels from Chengji, adding 140 yuan, and then He Sheng absorbed 60 taels, adding 150 yuan. Later, Defu and Baocheng each absorbed 50 taels from Yongcheng, and Yili absorbed 10 taels from He Sheng, all adding 150 yuan. It is estimated that the price increased by 20 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>Raw Gold Slightly Better at 6 Yuan</p>
<p>The market opened at 6,560 yuan per bar (10 taels) in the early morning, which was 4 yuan higher than the previous day. Then, because Decheng, Defu, Dayuan, and Yili threw out, it once fell to 6,545 yuan, but after that, Xianghe absorbed fiercely, followed by Xinfengyong, Xin Yu, Yili, Dafeng, and Gonghe, and Deda shorted, and then fell to 6,557 yuan. Later, Lai Jinyuan and Wanfeng absorbed, and Xianghe and Xiangxingyong re-entered, and Deda traced to buy to cover the short, so it rose to 6,565 yuan before the close, and the result was 6,563 yuan to close, which was 6 yuan higher than the previous day. The closing price was 6,594.1 yuan based on the US dollar price of 5.28125 in April, with a difference of 31.1 yuan. There was only 22 yuan in the half day. The selling price of the company's own brand gold was 180 yuan higher than Raw Gold, and the purchase price was 50 yuan lower than the selling price. The current bid gold, etc. had no market and no price.</p>
<p>The Exchange Rate for Ornament Gold Did Not Move</p>
<p>The exchange rate for silver and gold jewelry per tael has not moved all day. It is estimated that Da Tonghang and Xin Tonghang are still 690 yuan, and the purchase price is 40 yuan lower.</p>
<h3>Narrow Fluctuations in Foreign Currency</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the price of Raw Gold sluggish, and the British and American gold pounds also had no rise or fall. The British gold ticket remained unchanged, and the US gold ticket changed little. The opening price was 6.7 jiao, and after opening it fell to 6.5 jiao, and then rose to 6.9 jiao, and then fell to 18.67 jiao at the close, and the result was similar to the previous day. The supply and demand for Hong Kong tickets were uniform, and the market price was flat. Japanese gold tickets and Korean tickets were both weak, the former falling to 1.97 yuan, and the latter falling to 1.64 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: Government Bonds are Very Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for government bonds continued to weaken, and transactions were chaotic. However, Xinfu turned to have an appetite, and the nine-tenths appetite was also strong. The same Kang was frequently entering and exiting, while Yuxing was selling more. The situation was outwardly weak, but inwardly still strong, because there were many long-term investors, and the short-term positions were gradually decreasing. After several days of weakness, the short-sellers had added a lot of positions, and the environment was slightly better, and the reaction must be huge. Yesterday's transactions saw Xinfu Jiu Cheng Shunchang Xinyuan buying in the morning, Lianhe then took C and entered B, and most of the sellers were scattered households. Yuxing sold a lot of Type A. In the afternoon, Renchang Jiucheng bought, Tongkang entered E and exited C, Jiufeng slightly sold, Yuxing continued to sell Type A, so the result was only a small triangle for Type A alone, and the rest were only 0.05, 0.1 or 0.2. Currently, the market price is the cheapest for Type A and B. Yesterday's total transaction volume was about 800,000 to 900,000 yuan. The following is a simple table:</p>
<p>Type         Highest    Lowest     Closing     Compared to the Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A     75.55      75.30      75.30      Down 0.30</p>
<p>Unified B     68.55      68.40      68.45      Flat</p>
<p>Unified C     66.60      66.40      66.05      Down 0.10</p>
<p>Unified D     64.10      64.00      64.00      Also 0.20</p>
<p>Unified E     64.70      64.45      64.60      Also 0.05</p>
<p>In stock trading, 50 shares of Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory were traded at a price of 20.025 yuan.</p>
<p>The board of directors of the British Jardine Matheson Brewery Co., Ltd. resolved yesterday to pay a final dividend of 0.25 yuan per share on April 22.</p>
<p>London, 1st (Tuesday) telegram, today's listed prices of Chinese foreign shares and Far East British companies' shares were still sluggish, and only bank shares reported a rebound. The shares of Mackenzie Bank rose by 5 shillings to 8 pounds and 15 shillings, the shares of HSBC Bank London registered rose by 1.5 pounds to 75 pounds, and the shares of Hong Kong registered rose by 0.5 pounds to 77 pounds. There was a price but no market, and the rest were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Difficult for Both Buyers and Sellers, Stagnant Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market is dim and lacks excitement, and the trend is very weak, and the range of rise and fall is only within two yuan, which shows the disunity of people's hearts in general. This kind of scene is unprecedented this year. In fact, the environment is like this, because the long positions are burdened with a large accumulation of inventory, the two factories are too far away from the spot price, and the short positions are too expensive, and the factory's opening and incentive prices are also not very stable, so it presents a difficult situation for both buyers and sellers. Therefore, the speculators are all shouting that there is no target for the time being. The high price of 20-count Double Horse was 1394 yuan, and the low price was 1391.5 yuan. In the afternoon, because those who attended the Wednesday meeting were scattered, the market price was not opened. Today, 705 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The opening of Double Horse in the morning was extremely mediocre and had no momentum. The opening price was 1393 yuan, and it slightly weakened to 2.5 yuan, but the buying and selling in the market was very clear, and the market price did not change much. Later, it was heard that foreign exchange was quiet and the gold standard was stable, and the market was even less volatile. It had been fluctuating between 1393 and 4 yuan for two hours. The middle of the way was once stagnant, and the brokers were all doing nothing. Then the closing price was 1394 yuan. Checking the statistics of transactions in the half day, 3,765 bales were transacted. The amount of each gang buying is as follows: Hong Kong 465, Tonghang 3, 300 statistics 3, 765.</p>
<h3>Fine Velvet Factory has More Active Appetite, Speculators Sell Yarn and Buy Cotton</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is not as lively as the previous day, because the yarn market is not improving, and the foreign exchange is quiet, so it is back to normal. The factory has a normal mindset for 20-count raw materials, but is sometimes in demand for 32-count and 42-count raw materials. However, the general speculators are active again, because the cotton inventory is thinner than the yarn inventory, so there are many people who sell cotton yarn and drop into cotton, which is why the industry has been actively buying and selling recently. However, the fundamental problem is that the yarn market cannot rise, and the factory is unwilling to buy expensive cotton and lose money, and the source is still smooth, which is nothing more than the method of speculators moving east to make up for the west. A total of 1,082 pieces and 636 bales were transacted yesterday, and the price fell slightly by 1 or 2 yuan. The following is a record of the current cotton market:</p>
<p>New York American Cotton Telegraph, the market is mixed, first rising due to peer buying, then falling due to the selling of the Southern gang, and the closing of long positions and political news benefiting the short side. The closing result was a further drop of 8 to 10 pound tones compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Mumbai Indian Cotton Telegraph, first rising due to speculator buying, then slightly returning due to the closing of long positions. The closing result was a rise of 1 or 2 rupees compared to the previous day, and the opening forecast for tomorrow is a rise of 3 or 4 rupees.</p>
<h3>Textiles: Demand for Mill Cloth Progresses</h3>
<p>Cloth Market Slightly Weak</p>
<p>The mill cloth market remains stable; demand from local, Guangdong, and Hong Kong businesses has been progressing. Due to speculative buying in the futures market, Jardine Matheson's coarse cloth's spot prices have increased by 25 to 50 cents per bolt. Sixteen-pound Flower and Butterfly brand coarse cloth from Tongyi Mill has also risen by 50 to 70 cents. Fine cloth remains unchanged, while twill has increased by 10 to 25 cents. Guangdong and Hong Kong businesses traded several hundred bolts of Mermaid-brand colored twill. Zhejiang and Fujian businesses traded seventy to eighty bolts of coarse, fine, and colored cloth. Local dyeing factories and wholesalers traded over eight hundred bolts of gray, coarse, fine, and colored cloth. Fifty bolts of textile products were exported to Yantai in two days, thirty-one bolts to Xiamen in three days, and one thousand one hundred and sixty bolts to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth's market is slightly weak due to the stagnant yarn market. White fine cloth has fallen back by 10 to 20 cents per bolt. The latest stock list for ten-pound Dragon Head fine cloth closed in the afternoon at $49.80 for spot goods. However, colored broadcloth and fine cotton yarn remain expensive, and the market is tight. Stock prices for Four Gentlemen broadcloth fluctuate between $1.43 and $1.45.</p>
<p>Woolen fabrics are firmly priced, whether openly or covertly. Businesses from Beiping and Tianjin have been purchasing large quantities recently, especially spring and summer woolens. There is also significant demand for autumn and winter fabrics. Suit materials are more actively purchased than Chinese clothing materials.</p>
<h3>Coal: Coal Dust Prices Rise Daily</h3>
<p>Since the arrival of 6,000 tons of new Keelung coal dust a month ago, supplies have been scarce. However, demand from various businesses is strong, so market prices have been rising daily. Kaiping No. 2 coal dust is priced at $280, Indian coal dust at $320, Boshan coal dust at $275, and Keelung coal dust at $250. These prices are after industry discounts and delivered to the customer's location, with a small commission added.</p>
<p>Regarding anthracite coal, last month, due to various businesses withholding their stocks, there was a market without trade, allowing covert dealings to manipulate the market. Unexpectedly, yesterday, one business revealed the deal with other companies and the price increased again. Indian anthracite coal is now quoted at $400 per ton, Hongji coal at $370, and No. 1 Small Coal at $370, an increase of $20 to $30 compared to previous market prices. It is reported that large quantities have not yet been released.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Initially Firm, Then Loosen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was tight initially but softened later, with little change in the final outcome. According to the association's pricing, spot prices for No. 24 coarse white sugar initially rose by 15 to 16 cents, reaching $89.76 to $89.60, but then declined slightly by 10 cents to $89.40. Futures followed a similar trend. Contracts for April 10th were initially bid up from $89.90 to $90.01, then fell back to $89.87 to $89.70, a slight decrease of 10 cents. Contracts for April 20th were at $90.50, $91.00, and $90.07, $90.05, $90.06. Dutch red sugar remained at $68.80. Thai Zhan car white B-mark western stock was at $90.05 and a little over thirty cents. DY-mark eastern stock was at $84.50, HX-mark eastern stock at $84.00, and H-mark eastern red sugar at $65.00.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Fennel Prices High Due to Production Costs</h3>
<p>Due to repeated increases in production costs, the cost of fennel is rising daily. Yesterday, according to Hong Kong telegraph reports, quoted prices have risen again. The current cost in the Shanghai market is estimated to be $320. Although the Shanghai market is following this upward trend, it is still difficult to reach this price level immediately. Yesterday, the market price was quoted at $300, an increase of over ten dollars from before. The market is expected to tighten further.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Gardenia Will Arrive Soon</h3>
<p>Due to the lack of incoming goods, the market price of gardenia has risen by over twenty dollars. The tight situation has not eased. Yesterday, according to sources in the production area, transportation by steamer is not possible, so it is being shipped by sailboat and is expected to arrive in Shanghai soon. However, production costs have increased, and freight charges have also risen, so the market is expected to remain tight.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Iron Nails and Galvanized Iron Decline After Reaching Peak</h3>
<p>Iron Nails: The prices of local factory-made nails have been soaring recently, with standard nails exceeding the $200 mark. However, actual sales are not significant. This is due to hoarding by speculators. Because of limited distribution channels, there is now an oversupply of spot goods, leading to a decline in market prices. Yesterday, the price of each keg of Bessemer steel nails was $195.</p>
<p>Galvanized Iron: The situation in the plain galvanized iron market is similar to that of local factory-made nails. Both are used by the construction industry, but the industry has little appetite recently, so the circulation of goods is excessive, leading to softer sales prices. Currently, six-foot sheets are priced at around $15, and seven-foot sheets are priced at around $16.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Hainan Longan Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Recently, Hainan longan has seen active demand from Hankou businesses. Stocks are low, and suppliers are tightening supply. Prices have risen rapidly. Yesterday, it was reported that suppliers had released several dozen more packages, leading to an increase of over ten dollars. Businesses from Tianjin are also purchasing ordinary goods, with similar increases in price.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous: Import of Foreign Soda Ash</h3>
<p>The soaring price of Lilian crystal soap is reportedly due to a shortage of raw materials, especially those derived from fats and oils, leading to speculative hoarding. However, 2,460 bags of foreign soda ash arrived yesterday from Hong Kong, a significant quantity.</p>
<h3>Candles and Soap Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>The market price of soap is strong, with brisk demand from various quarters. Factories are only releasing small quantities to the industry, which is not enough to meet demand, leading to continuous price increases. Yesterday, the market price for a box of Gu Ben soap was $48.50, White Xiangmao soap was $47, and Yellow Xiangmao soap was $38.50, an increase of over five dollars compared to last week.</p>
<p>The market price of foreign candles is steadily rising. Speculators are continuously purchasing them, and companies are supplying less, leading to a tight market. Ship-brand candles are now selling for $30.04 per box (25 packages), with strong demand from various quarters and further price increases expected.</p>

<h3>Special Feature: Tianqi's Finger Paintings by Ge Zhaotong</h3>
<p>Finger painting in Chinese painting can be traced back to Zhang Zao of the Tang Dynasty, who first created it. He used his hands to touch the silk, creating excellent paintings that amazed the famous artist Bi Hong, who put down his brush in awe. When asked about his methods, he said, "Learn from nature, gain from the heart." By the Qing Dynasty, Gao Qipei learned finger painting in his dreams, and his figures, landscapes, birds, and fish were all lifelike. From then on, finger painting began to attract attention.</p>
<p>Finger painting and traditional brush painting differ in medium, and the feeling they give viewers is also unique. It strengthens the thickness of the brush while eliminating its weakness. When dry, it is lively and elegant; when wet, it is vigorous and simple. It is truly magical and creates natural effects that brush painting cannot achieve.</p>
<p>However, most Chinese painters do not study this unique form of finger painting, and those with limited knowledge are even less able to engage in it. It requires divine insight and diligent study to master its secrets. Zhang Zitianqi of Liangxi teaches Chinese painting at the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts. In his spare time, he immerses himself in creating finger paintings. He has been doing this for twenty years and is skilled in finger painting. Birds, secluded birds, pine trees, plum blossoms, bamboo, and rocks, once touched by his fingers, become even more ethereal. His style is based on that of Baiyang, Xinluo, Qingteng, Nantian, and Bonian, gathering their essence and creating his own style. Judging from the dozens of completed works exhibited this time, such as No. 280 "Longevity Picture," No. 27 "Warm Jade Hall Spring," and No. 209 "Bamboo Sparrow," the compositions are unique, the sparse flowers and fine buds are charming. No. 278 "Rose Spider," No. 266 "White Lotus Dragonfly," and No. 260 "Peach Willow Oriole" have bright colors and stable positions, conveying a sense of elegance, vigor, liveliness, and antiquity. No. 114, "Lotus Pond Refreshments," was once taken to Berlin by Liu Haisu during his second European tour and eventually purchased by the German National Art Museum. A reproduction is displayed here. Although it is only a flower and a leaf, the composition does not feel simple, and the transcendent, pure interest is abundant on the paper. Several ink paintings also have a unique flavor. Li Zhongqian wrote a poem on No. 215 "Old Age Wealth and Honor": "Old age sounds like cats and butterflies in the picture, and the fragrance of heaven writes about wealth and honor. Tianqi uses his fingers instead of brushes, and the magical changes divide yin and yang." Li Zhongqian wrote a poem on No. 213 "Ink Lotus Waterfowl Picture": "Mr. Zhang paints without using a brush, and all the six methods come from his fingers. He accidentally paints a singing waterfowl, with wild water, reeds, and autumnal bleakness." Zhu Tianfan wrote a note on No. 217 "Cat Butterfly Peony": "In the past, people occasionally used their fingers for painting to pursue interest. In the Qing Dynasty, Gao Qipei of Tieling devoted himself to this art, and his realm began to expand. After Gao, few people continued to pursue it. In this painting by Tianqi, the finger technique is skillful, the ink is thick, and it has the strength of Tieling, while also incorporating the style of Qingteng and Futang. It is truly a masterpiece."</p>
<p>It is also important to note that Tianqi's paintings are all based on his observations of real scenes, which is different from copying ancient works or fabricating constructions. Therefore, his paintings of fish, insects, scaled creatures, beasts, and birds are lifelike. This can also serve as a warning against the common practice of imitation in the world of Chinese painting.</p>

<h3>Western Youth Volleyball Season Opens: Yinghua Defeated; Lost to Russian Community Team 0-2; Girls' Team Minli Defeated Shanghai Star</h3>
<p>The 13th Western Youth Volleyball League opened at 6:45 PM last night in the association's gymnasium. The girls' team Minli vs. Shanghai Star first faced off. The rules for this year's girls' team competition have been slightly changed. Each match is 30 minutes long, with two 15-minute halves. The winner is determined by the number of points scored. In the first half of yesterday's match, Minli was very active, leading 18-5. In the second half, Shanghai Star worked hard to counterattack, and the match became tense. Although Shanghai Star scored one more point than Minli in the second half (10-9), they lost due to the excessive number of points lost in the first half, ultimately losing 15-27. In the next match, the B team Peide faced Haerhaerdeng. Peide narrowly won 2-1. Finally, the A team Yinghua faced the Russian Community Association. The starting lineup included Zheng Yiquan, whose spikes were still fierce, and Liu Zichang, whose blocks were occasionally brilliant. Mai Bingyao, however, showed signs of decline.

<h3>America Has a Children's City</h3>
<p>— Guo Hongdi</p>
<p>America has a children's city.</p>
<p>In the children's city, there are children's police, children's courts, children's mayors, children's newspapers, children's bands, children's factories, children's clubs, children's sports fields, children's teams, and children's photography clubs. The children's city is organized and managed by children, and it is an institution that seeks the welfare of children.</p>
<p>In Cleveland, America, there are six children's cities, with 3,000 citizens aged eight to eighteen. The children in the city work and play together in their spare time, practicing cooperation and learning to abide by the law. Children in the children's city gain new interests, develop new habits, and cultivate new personalities.</p>
<p>In 1937, there were 2,111 cases of juvenile crime in Cleveland. However, since the establishment of the children's city, the average number of juvenile crime cases has decreased to 235 per year. Citizens of the children's city pay a tax of three cents per person per month, and the total annual cost of the six children's cities is $4,000. The average annual cost per person is less than two dollars. Yes, it's a miracle, but this miracle is not accidental. This miracle can happen in America, it can happen in China, it can happen in Cleveland, and it can happen in Shanghai.</p>
<p>America has children's cities, and we hope that one day, China will also have children's cities, and Shanghai will also have children's cities.</p>

<h3>The Significance of Daycare Centers</h3>
<p>— Yan Junfu</p>
<p>Daycare centers originated in the late nineteenth century and can be said to be a product of the Industrial Revolution. Their development has been driven by social needs, and these needs continue to intensify with the industrialization, modernization, and awakening of women in the country. The mode of production after the Industrial Revolution required skilled techniques rather than strong physical strength, which allowed women to participate in social production like men. On the other hand, the income of wage laborers is often calculated on an individual basis. In this situation, it is necessary for women to participate in production work. As women became aware of their independent personalities and gained experience in social work, they further recognized that achieving true equality between men and women required first seeking equality in economic capabilities. However, there are many unavoidable conflicts between career and childcare, so daycare centers came into being, shouldering two important functions. On the one hand, they assist women so that they can continue to pursue their careers, maintain their families, and devote themselves to the women's liberation movement. On the other hand, they protect children, so that they can achieve sound development in both body and mind. Daycare centers have now achieved significant development in various European and American countries.</p>
<p>Since the October Revolution, the Soviet Union, on the one hand, sought to establish the foundation of women's liberation, reduce obstacles to women's participation in production work, and enable them to have the same opportunities and make the same contributions as men. On the other hand, it sought to protect and train young children, ensuring that they receive full care and collective living training. Therefore, the establishment of daycare centers was included in the government's policy agenda. Various permanent, seasonal, and temporary daycare centers were established in factories, farms, schools, shops, and even parks and cinemas. There are tens of thousands of them in total, caring for millions of young children.</p>
<p>Charitable organizations for children in our country, such as infant asylums and orphanages, have a long history, but daycare centers are a new movement in the last decade and are not a new name for infant asylums or orphanages. It is a type of social education institution that assists families but does not replace them. This is the fundamental difference between it and infant asylums or orphanages, because the former is a charitable relief organization that fulfills the responsibility of childcare on behalf of families. Due to limitations in talent and economy, this movement has not achieved widespread development in the past decade. Before the outbreak of war, such facilities existed in Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Beiping, Wuxi, and other places. Unfortunately, before the foundation could be firmly established and play a leading and exemplary role, they were cut short by the ruthless sound of gunfire. This was a major blow to this nascent movement.</p>
<p>Shanghai is an important industrial and commercial port, and the number of female workers and professional women is large. Under the pressure of dual tasks, their pain is self-evident. Recognizing the need for daycare centers for women in Shanghai, the Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association proposed the establishment of daycare centers for professional women and daycare centers in Shanghai. After more than a year of preparation, and with the generous support of enthusiastic people from all walks of life, who either donated money and clothing or contributed their personal experience or sacrificed time and energy, these two facilities were finally able to meet people from all walks of life today, and we feel very gratified. The daycare center for professional women is located in the Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association building on Mulou Road and specializes in accepting the young children of professional women for daytime care, who are picked up in the evening. The Shanghai Daycare Center is located in the Tongren Hospital on Bailinan Road and specializes in accepting the children of workers for day and night care. Due to economic constraints, both facilities are very small in scale, but even so, we have deep hopes for them. We do not think of them as isolated daycare centers, but as the beginning of a socialized childcare movement. We hope that people from all walks of life will continue to provide them with material support and spiritual encouragement, so that this small life can grow strong, so that this movement can generate strength, and then expand to various production sectors and throughout the country. As we celebrate Children's Day, we are deeply fortunate to see a new dawn in the cause of children's welfare.</p>
<h3>Autumn Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(6) A Product of Love</p>
<p>He truly meant well, but how could Qiu Haitang tell him about this? Moreover, the more he asked, the more flustered Qiu Haitang felt inside. If it weren't for his years of experience performing on stage, he almost wouldn't have been able to conceal it.</p>
<p>"It's really just some small matters, Seventh Master." He tried to appear calm, as if acting in a play, and deliberately lowered his head to brush some dust off the corner of his clothes.</p>
<p>"Alright, then I'll leave first!" Shao Wen said as he put on his hat, walking and talking to him. "It would be best if you could go. If you really can't, it doesn't matter. Anyway, Third Uncle doesn't have anything urgent."</p>
<p>Usually, because Shao Wen was so comfortable moving around his house, they didn't stand on ceremony. When Shao Wen was leaving, he would just stand up and nod. But today, he made an exception and saw him to the door, feeling extremely sorry for him and, at the same time, fearing that he might turn back.</p>
<p>This was, of course, especially strange to Shao Wen. He kept pondering in the car, wondering why his good friend's attitude had suddenly become so unusual today.</p>
<p>While he was full of doubt and indecision, Qiu Haitang had already retreated into his bedroom, hastily tearing open Xiang Qi's letter. In a state of excitement that almost made him faint, he began to read it line by line.</p>
<p>"After you left, I spent an entire day and night without sleeping or eating. To you, I can say without any reservation: at first, my heart was indeed filled with feelings of regret and resentment, as if many people were standing in front of me, pointing and scolding me. I almost believed that I had committed a great sin! How could a woman with a husband do such a thing? Moreover, you are an actor, an actor who plays female roles..."</p>
<p>Reading this, Qiu Haitang's face was completely flushed. He couldn't help but deeply regret that he shouldn't have been so excited the night before, which led to the destruction of his own years of restraint and the chastity of a woman he sincerely respected and loved.</p>
<p>"Maybe she will never acknowledge me again!" he wondered. Could this letter be a letter of severance?</p>
<p>But reading the next section, Xiang Qi's tone was completely different. (71)</p>

<h3>Little Aviators</h3>
<p>— Luo Wen</p>
<p>Among living beings, insects can be said to be the most outstanding aviators. The flight of fish seems clumsy compared to them, and airplanes are simply like heavy wooden boxes. Insects can soar in the wind, glide like gliders, and reach top speed within a second of takeoff, engaging in all sorts of amazing "performances" in the narrow air. The most skilled flying insects can even fly backward without changing the position of their bodies.</p>
<p>Insects' wings are naturally best suited for flying. They are extremely light. The four wings of a drone bee probably weigh only a cow's hair. But even though they are so light, they are also very strong. The front half of the wing is stronger than the back half.</p>
<p>Most butterflies and many moths overlap their forewings and hindwings, forming a pair of wings for flight. The two wings are connected by hooks, so they can transform into a "biplane" or a "monoplane" at will.</p>
<p>Insects don't just flap their wings up and down. One entomologist attached gold foil to the wingtip of a wasp and then illuminated it with a strong light. He saw the wasp's wing rotating in a figure-eight pattern.</p>
<p>Therefore, an insect's wing has greater efficiency than an airplane's propeller, and it also has the flight equipment of a vertical takeoff aircraft.</p>
<p>The "motor" that drives an insect's wing is sometimes extremely powerful. An American experimenter dissected a fly and found that its wing muscles accounted for thirty percent of its total weight.</p>
<p>Ms. U.D. Betts, who has conducted specialized research on the flying ability of bees, pointed out that the honeybee's "flight motor" (wing muscles) consumes a lot of fuel (i.e., honey). According to the latest surveys, a bee that flies outside must consume 30-40 milligrams of honey per hour, meaning that in a two-hour flight, a bee must eat an amount of food equal to its own weight.</p>

<h3>American Institute of Public Opinion</h3>
<p>— Jin Chun</p>
<p>Dr. Gallup, the president of the American Institute of Public Opinion, has discovered many interesting things when investigating the thoughts of the American public. For example, he found that among the American public who participate in voting, 30 percent cannot swim. If a woman were running for president, 66 percent of the public would refuse to vote for her.</p>
<p>The Institute of Public Opinion has discovered many interesting things. It found that 77 percent of the American public believe that Germany should be blamed for the outbreak of this World War; it found that the American public had the most divergent opinions on the true cause of the economic depression, with consistent opinions accounting for only 5 percent of the total; it found that 40 percent of the American public do not like swing jazz music; 10 percent simply do not know what swing music is; 75 percent believe in the afterlife (only one elderly person said: he doesn't know now, but he will know soon enough). 70 percent of the public hope that the government can abolish prohibition and allow texts on contraception to be published freely; 60 percent welcome the Duke and Duchess of Windsor to stay in America forever; 6 percent are unwilling to travel to Europe by plane, even if it costs nothing.</p>
<p>Gallup has done various surveys and statistics. He knows which radio programs are most popular with the public and which stories in magazines attract the most attention. He found that the majority of the public love to read photos and comic strips in newspapers and magazines. Gallup also constantly adjusts and compares the American public's love and dislike of President Roosevelt and his New Deal. It's really strange. According to Gallup's surveys and statistics, President Roosevelt's popularity is related to his fishing. Every time he goes fishing, the public's affection for him increases.</p>

<h3>Unique Skill</h3>
<p>— Li Liben</p>
<p>— One of the Best Submissions</p>
<p>She has a unique skill, which is "crying." This "crying" has a tune. She can add oil and vinegar to the past events and incorporate them into this crying tune. When crying, she stomps her feet and gestures wildly, sometimes sobbing and moaning, sometimes breathless and silent. If someone tries to persuade her, she will pat you on the shoulder and incorporate your affairs into the crying tune, and the crying will become even more severe. Unfortunately, this kind of crying has a drawback, which is that it cannot win the sympathy of others. The reason is very simple, which is that when she cries, the inner sadness cannot be naturally revealed. Perhaps this cry has no sadness to speak of in the heart, but is what we call "crying over the dead and scolding the living." (Response)</p>

<h3>Lovers Under the Sword</h3>
<p>— Cheng Bingnu</p>
<p>"The Count of Monte Cristo" is a famous work by Alexandre Dumas. "Lovers Under the Sword," a sequel to "The Count of Monte Cristo," is not written by Dumas, but is conceived by Hollywood screenwriters with great care. Nevertheless, the style of the story of "Lovers Under the Sword" is no different from "The Count of Monte Cristo," and is equally bold, exciting, and imaginative.</p>
<p>Louis Hayward plays the protagonist, the son of the Count of Monte Cristo. He is the richest man in Europe, young and skilled at fencing. He is full of a sense of justice and loves beautiful women. This handsome character with such a blood type will undoubtedly win the love of the princess of that small country and the support of countless audiences under the screen. Joan Bennett plays the princess, graceful and luxurious, much better looking than in her fashion films. George Sanders plays a scheming dictator. In his personal acting history, "Lovers Under the Sword" can be said to be his best film.</p>
<p>The story tells of Joan Bennett being imprisoned in the palace by Sanders. In order to save her and her people, Louis Hayward pretends to be a naive playboy during the day, but at night, he does earth-shattering things. In terms of the story itself, it is no different from the past "Mark of Zorro" and "The Scarlet Pimpernel," but because the whole film is full of exciting action, a lighthearted tone, and rich imagination, the audience does not feel it is old-fashioned at all. The director understands the audience's psychology and often puts the two main characters in the film in precarious situations, and then unexpectedly saves them, making the audience pat their chests and shout "Dangerous!" Taking the final climax as an example, Sanders and Joan Bennett are about to get married. The screen shows them slowly walking into the church, slowly putting on the wedding ring, and the pastor slowly reciting the vows. The audience almost wants to drag Louis Hayward over. Then, Louis Hayward appears in a surprising posture, announcing Sanders' conspiracy in front of everyone. Then, with superb swordsmanship, he ends Sanders' life, and then, to the great satisfaction of the audience, the lovers finally get married.</p>
<p>Louis Hayward is best suited to play this kind of role. His humor and his heroism have a moving quality that is different from Tyrone Power's. Perhaps this is because he is better at acting than Tyrone Power?</p>
<h3>"The Two Heroes' Restoration"</h3>
<p>— Mo Ye</p>
<p>While the roar of Skipon Lajin is still ringing in our ears, we accept this great gift with even more joy and pleasure.</p>
<p>This is a grand film that is more artistic and greater than "The Heroes' Bloody Battle"! It is the epic of the new Soviet Union and the model for millions of revolutionary comrades. Although the screenwriter used more subtitles, closer to the form of a biography, due to the proper direction and editing, we do not feel bored or dull at all during the entire performance of more than two hours. Compared to our "Confucius" (which also uses many subtitles to explain the immortal achievements of the saint!), it grasps a more tense atmosphere and makes more use of special techniques in film; these seem to be superior aspects.</p>
<p>We must establish a national style and national form. A nation should naturally have its own special style. In Soviet films, what is active throughout the entire screen is heavy, serious, and powerful; playfulness and nimbleness are out of the question. Because of this, we should learn how to work hard for our own glorious national art!</p>
<p>In the whole film, in addition to the tense atmosphere, the handling of the big scenes, those tense, dangerous, and hand-to-hand combat scenes are simply unprecedented. The struggle of thousands of people can be handled in an orderly manner, which is worthy of being an veteran director; even Hollywood can only look up to it.</p>
<p>Putovkin's composition of the screen is beautiful, magnificent, and majestic. In addition to this, we can hardly find any fault, and even the setting is unique. Furthermore, the way the people look up to Moscow's destruction with tears in their eyes, and the fall of various capitals, with millions of people embarking on their path of exile with disappointment, indignation, and anger, not only emotionally moves the audience and stirs people's hearts, but the composition also reaches the most excellent level, with each frame like a delicate woodcut.</p>
<p>The actors who play Pozharsky and Minin both perform so calmly, without any sign of affectation.</p>
<p>What is superfluous is perhaps the overly limited time.</p>
<h3>Rambling Notes from Movie City</h3>
<p>— Wang Xuan</p>
<p>Ann Harding, a once-popular female star, has retired from the film industry for several years, but there are still many fans who remember her. Recently, Ann Harding married the famous musician and writer Johnson, and she may soon make a comeback and return to the screen.</p>
<p>"Father" Ettore Bugatti recently held a "What I Want to Be" banquet, and many big stars attended in the costumes of what they hoped to be when they were children. Bette Davis wore the costume of ballerina Pavlova, whom she had admired; Dick Powell dressed up as a streetcar conductor; his wife, Joan Blondell, dressed as a dancer from the South Pacific islands; Jackie Coogan dressed as a wealthy African tycoon; Bette Grable dressed as a Muslim woman; Bob Burns dressed as a railway engineer; Jean Hersholt dressed as a doctor; and there were other kinds of strange costumes, dazzling and extremely grand.</p>
<h3>Joan Bennett's Princess Style</h3>
<h3>Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy to Disband, "Bittersweet" to Be Their Last Work</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Singing superstars Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy have collaborated six times and are highly regarded in the film industry, but news has come that, according to MGM officials, they will soon disband. However, before they part ways, the authorities have specially produced a five-color singing tragic film "Bittersweet" as a memorial. This is worth noting.</p>
<p>The content of "Bittersweet" tells the story of a lady from a noble family who is fascinated by music and falls in love with a musician. On the eve of her wedding, she sacrifices everything and elopes with the musician to Vienna, where she suffers all kinds of hardships and lives a miserable life. As a result, she works as a singer in a hotel to support their lives. Unexpectedly, an officer takes a fancy to her and duels with her husband, becoming a ghost under the sword, causing her to live a miserable life as a widow with a hundred years of regret.</p>
<p>This story is very similar to the love history of "Zhuo Wenjun's elopement with Sima Xiangru" in our ancient China. Zhuo Wenjun has become our immortal fragrant and colorful tale. The story of "Bittersweet" is equally tragic, passionate, and sorrowful. Since this is the last collaboration of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, it is very precious.</p>
<h3>Drama News</h3>
<p>— Jue Xin</p>
<p>Lan Jutian is sick. It is said to be quite serious. Lian Yipeng told me so, saying, "In the past, if my father felt unwell, he would never collapse. This time, he is lying in bed, probably because of his age." Everyone loves and cares for this martial arts master as they love and care for Xin Fang. Upon hearing the news of his illness, they are naturally very concerned.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, I went to Baokang Lane to visit him, but he had already gone out. According to his friend Hong Qinggui, "He overdid his training and caught a cold, but it's not very serious. Now a doctor named Ge is treating him. He and this doctor are very good friends. The doctor is afraid that he will still practice and go to the French Park, so he warned him not to go out. Therefore, he is resting in bed more."</p>
<p>Perhaps his performance at the Golden Grand Theater will not be affected by the illness.</p>
<h3>"A Midsummer Night's Dream" Scene</h3>
<h3>A Life Philosophy of Struggle</h3>
<p>— Zong Yu</p>
<p>It is not difficult to muster the spirit of struggle, but it is difficult to put down the spirit of struggle. When you want to put it down, you hold it very high. When you want to loosen it, you bind it very tightly. As the poet said, "My heart is like a knot," and you cannot be the master of yourself at all. This is because the roots in your mind have not been planted deeply. When you get into it, you feel distressed.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain in the Jade Garden</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Red Skirts Cause Jealousy in Pomegranate Flowers</p>
<p>Although the end of the Ming Dynasty had the wise lord Emperor Huai, the vitality of the blood country had long been severed, like a dying patient, unable to withstand any more storms. Internally, there were natural disasters and man-made calamities; externally, there were rising strong enemies. Attacked from inside and outside, how could it not perish? The origin of the roaming bandits was caused by six types of people: first, rebellious soldiers; second, escaped soldiers; third, courier soldiers; fourth, starving people; fifth, police horses; and sixth, refugees. All started in Shaanxi and then spread everywhere. This was also because the land in the area was high and thick, the folk customs were strong and fierce, and the local officials and generals had no fixed policy of suppression and appeasement. In the beginning, they were too negligent, so that it became unmanageable once the chaos started. These things are recorded in detail and completely in the history books, and it is not difficult to read them. However, my book also has a small relationship with the roaming bandits, so I have to describe it very briefly. At first, Yue Dangqiao was the governor of Shaanxi, and Mi Tongmeng was the governor of Yansui, both of whom were extremely greedy and abused the people. In addition, there were consecutive years of drought, and refugees had nowhere to beg for food, so they came out to plunder food. The outlaws in the forest stirred up trouble, and the rebellious soldiers and escaped soldiers joined in, so they rioted everywhere, and the situation was about to burn the plains. At that time, there were many bandits such as Little Red Wolf, One Zhangqing, Hunjianglong, Lue Dihu, Mantianfei, Dian Dengzi, Li Laochai, Huntu Hou, and Duxinglang, rising like wind and clouds everywhere. The government army attacked from the east and west, but could not put them out. Among them, the most powerful were Zhang Xianzhong of Yan'an and Li Zicheng of Mizhi. Zhang Xianzhong called himself the Eighth Grand King; Li Zicheng called himself General Chuang. Although Emperor Huai sent Yang He, Hong Chengchou, Sun Chuanting, and others to suppress them one after another, the more they suppressed, the more chaotic it became, and they could not be stopped. They were finally trampled on by the roaming bandits in the Central Plains, causing a deep concern that led to the fall of the country. The generals at that time were not without the crime of harming the country. It is a pity that there were two good opportunities to capture and kill Zhang and Li. If one of them died, perhaps the roaming bandits would not be difficult to gradually put out. Unfortunately, the person in charge missed the opportunity, and they were able to survive from desperation and make a comeback. (28)</p>
