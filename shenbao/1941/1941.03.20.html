<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本的鎭靜</h3>
<p>美國租借法案的通過與夫羅斯福總統上星期六的重要演說，無論在美國史抑或世界史上，都是非常重要的一頁；此其意義，除却在這些行動或熊度本身所表示的而外、另有更重要的一點，便是今日的民治國家已經不以守住自己壁壘爲已足，而業在侵略國家運用攻勢之前爭取了主動地位的運用。在事實上，歐非戰局，英國在地中海兩岸已在原有的積極軍事行動之外，從事儘先擊潰軸心陣綫較弱一環的策動；在遠東，中國也久已醞釀着全面的大舉反攻；而美國最近的動向，都形成了恰合時宜的推動因素。在這一點上，侵略陣綫顯然已經是落了後。</p>
<p>美國這一明確立塲揭示之後，世界各個角落都一致表示着重大的反響，就中爲反侵略而戰以至還停在中立步驟的民治國家，無不一致表示快慰；而在侵略國家之間，縱然憤恚是相同的，在程度上却有顯明的差異。據連日消息，納粹方面不只用了若干惡毒名詞以事攻訐。並傳已有對美實行絕交的醞釀，而業經證實了的德潛艇向美領海出動，也難保不造成路西坦尼亞事件（上决美國參戰的導火綫）的重演。這在日本，則態度遠不如納粹的激昂，當局且表示鎭靜，謂美總統的演說並無新穎因素。他們反應的彼此參差，決不僅是表面姿態表情的不同：亦不僅因爲盟主夥伴異其地位，或者美國援助英希與中國有緩急之分，所得作爲圓滿的解釋。</p>
<p>以歐局和遠東此較，雖然太平洋所牽涉的國家不過中美英蘇與日本、不像歐洲有許多方面的前綫及若干非交戰國家與微妙的形勢夾雜其間，但是在束方却也有若干特殊因素的存在，非歡陸所能比擬。第一，德國戰時的國際關係早經確定，開戰以來，除却繼續擴展其支配範圍而外很少新的變化，其於美國早已形成變相的絕交，至低限度也缺乏常態外交與經濟關係的存在。至於遠束，則不僅在不久以前、日方尙未停止其對美幻想，而繼續賣弄其外交姿態，且縱然雙方商業關係已在無條的形式下苟且拖延，日本亦迄仍繼續其對美的經濟依存；近來日當局雖高唱自足自給與建立高度國防，然事實成績如何，仍爲一謎。因之迄今日方仍不能不相當顧盧美國之進一步採取經濟制裁。第二，在美國尙未直接參戰以前，除却禁運和封鎖一類措施而外，一切對德的運用只有經過英希等交戰國做爲中介去遂行，雙方的直接接觸，暫時還是不容想像的事。其在遠東、中國固也與英希之在歐洲具有同樣機能，此外美國自身更已採取堅定應變的措置；遠者如大海軍法案的成立，三洋艦隊的劃分，近者如關島菲島與阿留申等地的增防，美英在南太平洋聯防的進行，以至日來夏威夷美艦之到新西蘭聘問，都是美國所直接加於日本的威力。第三，希特勒經營歐陸，鞏固後方的工作，已差不多底於完成，而大部分爲英國所鞭長莫及，且與兩國最後的決戰顯然是不同的兩件事。但遠東日本所揭櫫「共榮圈」「協同體」的企圖，則正在進行中途，尙少顯著效果可言；此一企圖的進行，同時也就是美日關係斷續的關鍵；同時日本對於亞洲大陸的經營又顯然與在繼續中德中日戰事不能分開。第四，租借法案的本身既暫以援助英希爲其最切近的任務，自然是納粹最感切膚之痛；日方對於羅總統所肯定表示的援華，固然非所樂聞，然今日的日本已站在侵華和南進的歧途，其國內已有人高唱爲了南進不妨放棄侵華。而且中日戰爭迄於此際，日方確亦多少具有味同雞肋之感；察彼存心，豈不以爲縱使中國已有充分戰具以從事全綫反攻，則只要民治國在太平洋的艦隊不取斷然動作，充其量也不過是日軍退出中國戰塲。尙不致妨碍其海上行動的自由，第五，關於歐戰，美國幾乎完全把英國的得失和本國的安危緊緊聯繫在一起；在遠東，則美國對於中日戰爭，此較對英，有稍輕的權益關係，有稍遠的安危關係，因爲較輕較遠，一面被有些美國人所疎忽了，漠視了，一面也就是前此日當局對美若干幻想所由發生。上述種種因素，一方會使日本意識到未來前途的嚴重，不敢過事輕舉妄動，他方又表示着日方對於美日間的現存關係，還需要並可能再拖延若干時日，以靜待未來的新因素與新變化，而以松岡的赴歐聘問與近在眉睫的英德大戰爲其主要期待着的對象。</p>
<p>無論如何。美國最近的措施與其最大決心的顯示，已經是在民治國家與侵略陣綫的長途競賽過程中取得先着，不問略侵者對此如何表示，預料其決沒有足夠與此對抗的有效對策。這無疑會使國際間若干自危的國家增强了勇氣與決心，動搖者重歸穩定，有替侵略者幫兇可能的份子也不能不重新嚴重考慮自身步驟及其後果，而日本在表面所極力表示的鎭靜亦勢難盡掩其內心的苦悶和焦燥。其此後所可能選擇的途徑已較前更爲狹窄，且無論其所期待着的究爲何物，可斷言其既不會是一個規模無比的兵工廠，也必沒有把民治國家澈底擊潰的希望和實力。二十個月之前，日本派往聘問德義的寺內壽一和大角岑生，曾在中途碰到出乎意外的蘇德釋嫌言好；此决松岡甫出國門又遭逢美方表示其堅强步驟與決心，這可以說是日本聘問德義使節共同的噩運，也可以算是歷史的巧合，然而這却又暗示着</p>

<p>羅斯福總統每天早上九時在床用了早膳，一天間的公務也就從此開始。首先進他臥室的是國務院秘書歐萊華生將軍（專管總統會客之事），勒亨女士和麥金泰醫帥等四人。華生將軍一見總統之面，不談正事，先來一個笑話。麥醫帥是他的老友，每晨相見叩問他宵來可曾安睡，身體感覺怎樣。總統十天倒有九天說身體很舒服。</p>
<p>照例的一番晨間寒暄過後，「老又」華生將軍就把一天裏會客名單呈上。總統一一用筆註出，有的客人由他親自接見，有些則由秘書歐萊代見，或由別的官員接談。遠道而來覲見總統的人，華生將軍總把他們列在名單前茅，以便總統先行定奪。有時候羅斯福會授意華生將軍，在名單末另行加上一兩個客人，這眞如俗語所謂「挨城門」般，可謂幸運者了。星期一早上，華生將軍所開上的名單，人數總在五十左右，被淘汰的爲數亦不在少。由此可見羅斯福總統單以會客一事來說，已經够麻煩的了。</p>
<p>中午，羅斯福即在辦公廳中進膳，用一隻特製裝有四輪的保暖箱，把各種菜肴送到他面前。午膳大概爲一道淸湯，一道雞蛋，乳酷蛋糕，或生菜。他在白天不進甜品，早餐吃咖啡，午餐後進茶，晚間所吃的爲一種沒有刺激性的「聖卡」咖啡。</p>
<p>下半天除了會客之外，又要出席會議，像星期二的新聞記者例會，星期四的國防委員會議，和星期五的閣議等，至於和各國使節談話及接見閣員等，叉爲「家常便飯」之事。最近國際風雲險惡，國防和外交問題會議，常常弄得他分身乏術，因之對於各種的會往往遲到，譬如每逢招待新聞記者，他就沒有法子準時到會。在去年十二月底一决談話會席上，他曾對各報記者說，一九四一年新年裹，他總要設法下一決心，嗣後不再犯失的遲到的毛病，但是他又說，話雖如此，却並不能加以保證呢。</p>
<p>羅斯福雖然每天公務十分繁忙，但還是好客不倦，因之時間愈覺不够。有人形容說，總統是被鎖在寫字台旁的，他雖有送客之心，而無送客之力，其實這是靠不住的玩笑　而已。實際上，華生將軍常在相常時間中，示意總統，請任客退去。總統既好客，又愛談話，要是由他一個人弄去，那末在整個早晨的時間中，決沒有法子接見七八個客人。八年以來，羅斯福在白宮中，精神抖擻，好客如命，誠可謂牛有異禀者歟。</p>
<p>傍晚五時半到九時是羅斯福一天間最優閒的辰光。他每於按摩之後，假寐片刻。晚飯前，如果有興致的話，他會親手調弄「考克推爾」饗客。在擺滿了小玩竟的寫字台上，攤放了許多盞杯酒瓶，他調製搖攪，以此爲樂。晚膳爲大菜，有湯，有魚，有肉，生菜及甜點心。羅斯幅不甚嗜甜食，常以乳酪代之。他在各種食品中，對於野味水魚等尤別有嗜好，各方餽贈甚多。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統在白畫喜穿灰色或籃色服裝，晚上着深色衣服，玄色領帶和軟襯衫。他有時候會在外面罩上一件黑絲絨外褂。</p>
<p>住在華盛頓京城的時期中，羅斯福總統除了出遊之外，很少機會離開白宮。他最喜歡在星期杪駕「波托馬克」號艇出遊，或回海德公園鎭故居，或經溫泉休假及偶爾搭乘軍艦出巡。他對出外旅行興趣特別濃厚，允其愛好坐遊艇。他就任首屆大總統時期中，曾把一艘海岸巡邏艇「愛勒兄脫拉」號，改稱爲「波托馬克」號，每逢星期六總是坐了道艘遊艇溯波托馬克河而上，認爲唯一的當心樂事。</p>
<p>遊艇之中特裝電梯一輛，羅斯福從艙中往甲板晒太陽時，便以此代步。他每决出遊，總有四五位至友相伴而行。在船中一切無拘無束，優遊自在。有時整天睡在舖上，閱讀書報，或玩賞郵票。有時則在甲板上垂釣爲樂。他喜歡釣鰻魚，以爲風味絕佳，不遜童雞。星期日早晨，海軍飛機把所有郵件報紙從空中連送到遊艇。「波托馬克」號後面常跟隨着一艘「喀和格」號，上面戴有許多特務人員。碰到有緊急事情時，總統便離「波托馬克」號遊艇，而登「喀和格」號快艇，直放最近的碼頭，換乘汽車返京。</p>
<p>表面上講起來，這遊艇不過載着羅斯福總統到處休憇而已，並不在船上討論國家大事，但據非正式消息，美國把驅逐艦供給英國的決策，也許就是在某一决遊程中所定的。</p>
<p>羅斯福如果於週末返海德公園鎭故居，向來總是在星期四晚上出發，目下因爲公務繁忙，很少再能在星期五之前離開白宮了。他所乘坐的爲特別專車，一共八節。最後一節爲「普爾門」式花車，羅斯福即食宿於具中。倒數上去，第二節車載着秘書，速記員和賓客們。第三節車完全爲特務人員所用，人數的爲十八名。第四節爲隨員餐車，再前兩節專供新聞記者，攝影員，電影新聞攝影員，技術人員，郵政人員，鐵道職員之用。再前第七節內設有上下舖位，供卓上員工及其牠特務人員乘坐。火車引擎後一節車，半作俱樂部，半係行李中。車頭前覆有兩面白棋，從華盛頓出發後，中間除檢視車軸外，途中很少停留。從前總統專車之前，現有一輛壓道車開着，現在專車常在普通客車開口後　出，已不用開路的車子了。各鐵路公司爲對總統表示敬意起見，「收費從廉」除了普通車價優待之外，不過加收一些「普二門」車的額用旅費而已。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統本人很少機會與金錢接觸。他碰得到錢的時候，除非要在偶爾高興時打撲克或玩橋牌的席面上。國家每年給他旅行和正式歡宴等公費共計美金三萬元，另外加上每半月一發的俸金支票日千一百二十五美元。他拿到了這些支票之後，便在票背上簽字交給勒亨女士。由她交與白宮差役，往白宮對街李格士國民銀行中存放。羅斯福與該銀行往來已經有好幾年之久了。（完）</p>

<p>東華足球會名譽秘書黎實駿、昨對此次逸園球賽不幸事件、有所聲述、而各西人報紙、對東華允多誣衊、故特提出七點、闡明當時情形及責任間題、茲分誌如下、（一）東華所得而被判無效之第一球、係賈幼良打進、當時戴麟經在守鬥附近、並未與西捕守門菩爾平搶球、（當時卡納爾指戴撞菩犯規）東華球員初時以爲戴越位、致被判罰任意球、後始知侵人犯規、此實莫須有之事、（二）東華離塲、實因黃克厚與菩兩平互撞而起、事前西捕中鋒威利華特、亦曾猛撞秦必高、秦幾致臥地不起、（此事在塲中西人當有目共睹）卡僅判罰任意球、何對黃之犯規、除罰球外、而竟予以警吿、此點顯見裁判不公、（三）當黃被警吿後、戴上前向卡表示、「此種普通犯規情形、竟予警吿、已進之球、可算不進、殊不知當如何踢法、」卡聞言、即令戴離塲、至大陸報所稱戴辱駡卡納爾、絕非事實、緣戴玩球已十餘年、馳騁球塲、素有大將風度、從未有失禮或舉動粗野之處、爲中外人士所深悉、何此次比賽、竟一反十年來之常態、而侮辱裁判、足見大陸報所稱、於情於理、均屬不合、（四）此次甲組決賽、當爲極重要之一慕、西聯會應派極端公正之中立人士爲裁判、如中英在國際盃中、以德人爲裁判、而以義大利人爲巡邊員、殊覺正當、但此次竟以與西捕有關係之卡納爾（按卡爲　人、在救火會任秘書職、）爲裁判、則司馬昭之心、固路人皆知矣、（五）西報有將觀衆越規舉動、歸咎東華者、並稱因東華之棄權而激起事變、此事東華根本不能予以承認、蓋東華非職業團體、觀衆多、收入盈萬、與東華均毫無關係、假如當時觀衆僅一人在塲、東華在忍無可忍之局面下、亦必離塲而停止續賽也、（六）卡納爾前次爲西人隊之門守、對華人向極歧視、認爲野蠻粗暴、其心中固早已有成見、如卡納爾者、以充裁判員、欲求共公正、豈可得乎、（七）前年西福斯對薩伐亞、在跑馬廳發生動武不幸事件、裁判亦屬卡納爾、此公固善於激起事變之戎首也、總之、此次東華旣受無端壓迫於先、復遭橫加誣衊於後、言之殊覺痛心、爰作上述聲明、昭吿各界人士、幸祈垂鑒云云、</p>

<h3>糧食只要囤虎一放手　米價卽回降三四元</h3>
<p>洋米昨天囤胃一懈、市價立即下遊、可信邇日米價上漲、完全被囤戶所提高、某方不顧上海民食、旣阻內地米來滬、反在市上放價收買火上加油、爲囤戶張氣燄其在國戶心理、無非以囤積米糧、大利所在、有若金城之固、實則向薪工及斗升小民身上去剝削是造孽、不是與其他買賣之賺頭可比、最可惡、行貪很之實還有時惺惺作態、偏說爲民食打算、希冀延芳於世、而不念如此危害民食、直將貽臭萬年、比之老虎頭下捉吳蚣、兇險得多、此外尙有看得眼紅之新國戶、盲目　買、越高越拖、以致常常造成空前高價、而本客實銷尙須核合成本與其他計算手　等等、　如本市大量存米亦爲國戶所把持、且此批存貨據調查之下、大半掛號銀錢業戶名、據說、半是投　、一半是押款、究竟是否押款、只有業中人自知之、而米商行販之流備存米、反占少數、倘使此大量死貨使其活動、則市價　抑平易易耳、咋因囤化稍淡、到頭父多、貼價步步轉落、成交旣寥、各色洋米暗盤悉回三四元不等、若小絞初自四千二三百元、至此貶貼四千一百元、至四千元、二號西貢貼三千七八百元、一號西貢暹　及火絞自三千六七百元、貼至三千三四百元、米菉貼三千元、决至二千七八百兀、碎尖貼二千四五百元、决至一千六百元云云、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米到貨突旺、兼洋米黑市挫跌、無論賣買雙方心思、遂均轉軟、所以貨主在銷滯鬆脫之下、若厚粳行情帕見回貶元砠、開常幫斛見白粳百念七元至念五元、崑山斛白粳高自百念四元、次至百念元、原句中關百念五元、而薄稻以納胃較細、猝又回落二三元、開靑角斛見薄稻百十六元至百十五元、原包百念二元、</p>
<p>糯米處此他貨一致趨疲之下、交易更稀、不過懷貨者以市存不豐、尙無輕售之意、是以市價雖貶不烈、僅略爲帶軟元砠而已、開香港白元高自百零六七元、决至百零三四元、糯茶九十六七元、决至九十四五元、</p>
<p>法輪連日運來大批洋米、　定號前日運來　萬包、已誌　報、勞亞司號前晚八時許抵埠、停靠虹口華順碼頭起卸、尙有大量在後繼續來、（祖）</p>
<h3>洋粉到存兩豐　—小麥依然停滯—</h3>
<p>洋粉巿况、續居盤旋之局、香來源方面、香港轉口貨絡繹而至、新到利生裕生太原三輪共到四萬四千八白餘包、均已起卸、目下存到兩充、市面並無特殊變化、惟隔日午後被米市漲風一度激昂、昨日上午花鳥脾澳粉開價仍爲二十二元五·六角、坎粉金龍牌三十一元五·六角、而後市父隨米價再見回鬆至三·叫角、市　買賣與直接配客者、其價稍有參差、蓋以邇日人心較平、投機買賣、確已减少、</p>
<p>小麥交易、依然停滯、內地產價旣昂、來貨勢難通暢、租界存麥、日見枯竭、堪稱有市無貨、目下阜豐停車、福新僅恃洋麥、供應平賣、僅滬西及虹口方面日廠略有收　、價仍爲四十五·六元、麥市前途、一時終乏開展之望、</p>
<h3>雜糧　皮球勢弱　油豆下挫</h3>
<p>昨日雜糧油豆市况、一致下游、苞米雖受國際風雲牽制、脚地牢硬、但各貨漲風均竟歛跡、人心不免動搖、所以散戶不守、已始轉賣、皮球勢弱、行情不得不下瀉、結果不論期現均挫跌一元左右、黃豆除歸德豆能靠榨油廠有需要、囤戶尙在拉提外、其他繼續頻跌、較上日行情再修元外、豆油在調劑公司傾壓下、已呈疲態、雖有業外囤戶支持、然到貨源源不絕、且久傳不來之漢口油、尅日或可運抵、人心不振、市價暴落二四元不等云、</p>
<p>又十九日進口、生油一千二百聽、由靑島運來、（二十日出口）有豆子五百六十五包、豆餅六千塊、均運厦晨、另有豆餅四千塊、芝蔴五百四十五包、俱運香港、</p>
<h3>金融美滙帶緊</h3>
<p>外匯咋日市况、匯豐掛牌悉無上落、英美匯暗市、頗感呆定、惟交易尙暢、因投機商半日中、售出甚多、初以匯豐肯進、市面與上日午後價格相仿、嗣聞華行如大陸等吃胃相當健旺、故潛勢反帶緊狀、現美匯遂由五元四三七五回至四〇六二五、英匯少有做開、迄午收止、兩匯均乏上落、結果現貨英匯仍三便士三一二五、美匯五元四〇六二五、軋軟〇三一二五、期貨吿平、</p>
<p>期貨均無上落</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠期均平紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美不動對滬縮○六二五、美對英未更對滬大四分、對法均無市、中央掛脾各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英余三便士三一一五、美滙五元四三七五、與上日收市價相較、英美兩匯均平、開後投機商吐售叫月份美匯仍夥、計由匯豐吃入價五元四三七五、匯豐掛牌揭曉各滙勿動、白銀平衡稅無上落、此後投　家雖售、而滙豐繼續維持。且華行大陸等已萌買意、市而遂見回軟、但期貨木有變化、迨至午收、現貨、匯乃與期貨拉平、均爲五元四〇六二五、計現貨軋縮〇一二二五、期貨英匯依然吿三便士二一二五午後週一無巾、</p>
<p>香港匯價無變</p>
<p>香港十九日（週三）電、今晨匯市開盤吿平、祇申匯現貨降落一元、爲四百五十元、其餘不動、十一時三十分告平、申匯現貨回升一元、為四百五十二元、餘無變動下午週三無市、</p>
<p>天津英美放長</p>
<p>天津十九日（週三）電、今晨滙巿開盤吿鬆、倫敦電滙硬〇六二五、為三便士半、紐約電匯長二五、爲五元八一二五、申匯降七角五分、爲九十二元七角五分、「聯鈔」暗　昂八角五分、爲七十二元四角、</p>
<h3>金價轉穩</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗盤、由疲轉堅、升近六千四百元關邊、乃美金帶軟、滬西幫出籠突中止故也、初鑫源天元與恒記　小至六千三百五十元、嗣經滙票商大豐新豐永證券幫錢兌業爭購、升至六千四百元關口、爲限價賣戶壓住、終僅復升十元、半日交易五六千兩、各方人心尙穩、掉期三月轉入四月、賣方仍貼出予買方四十元、現金勢亦轉堅穩、先由成記出五十兩、照期交價高二百七十五元、祥和繼出一百五十兩、合盛出一百十兩、均高一百八十元、全由祥興永獨家買進、下午週三無市、飾金關金等均平、</p>
<p>冉冉上升近四百元關</p>
<p>晨初以上日晚風殊弱、檯面賣戶多而買者少、致開盤吿六千三百七十元、開後遂瀉、以恒記大元等售出、曾降全六千三百五十元、的過牛小時、始見盤高、中順源大豐一大等頻收但漲勢極緩、至十點半後、由八十元左右、漸升達六千四百元、欲向四百元關外、步出甚難、因合盛成記斯時均作賣出、回小至六千三百八十八元、嗣父挺至六千三白九十五元、呈徘徊之狀、午收結果六千三百　十二元、比十日軋漲十元、午後週三無市、本日五十元上落、現金號之本牌金售價較烚赤期交高二百元、收進低八十元、現標金等均無市、</p>
<p>銀樓飾金　原價未動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、未有上落、計大同行掛六百八十元、新。行與上價相仿、收進低三十元云、</p>
<h3>外幣升降倐忽</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價、跌後轉漲、英美金錢因亦跌後回平、英　票呆定如故、市僅站平、美金票始則退至一角八分即步漲、最俊爲十八元二角六分、比上日軋升一分、香港票趨勢仍挺、市價續漲一分、日金票父趨堅挺、晚市復高至一元九角四分朝鮮票供求仍衡晚市仍站一元六角原盤、</p>
<h3>紗花出口棉紗　廠津貼六七十元</h3>
<p>紗市仍在徘徊之途、但實除交易雖無大量的發展、然廠方獎勵現紗出口起見、雙馬廠單掉換現貨、確實證明外裝者每包可津貼六十元至七十五元、就此一點、投機人們心思轉向看高一步、惟　券幫之定額仍在掉期中、可每日收進利鈿、所以紗市在此四百元關口、遂呈拉鋸戰矣、二十支雙馬高價一千叫百十四元、低價一千三百九十五元、午後初做一千四百十七元、跌至十四元、最後價爲一千四百十七元、又棉紗今有三十五件、運往厦門、父有六百零五件、運往香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、人氣和平、爲一千四百零一元、微升至一千四百零六元、旋後檯面鬆懈、空方活動、敲破四百元關口、爲一千三百九十五元、但金市開盤安定、盈利者扒補、又上復出四百元外、然再進至一千三百九十六元、繼後因金價昂升、及同時實銷尙佳、絡續漲全一千四百十四元收盤、查半日間成交統計六千九百七十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>香港　八二〇　南洋　三五〇</p>
<p>同行　五、八〇〇　統計　六、九七〇</p>
<h3>美棉繼漲　本棉零星交易</h3>
<p>現棉市情况較昂、同業互相買賣、甚爲熱鬧、所以行悄帶堅矣、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、因空頭抵補、及華盤頓報吿正式實行貸款而漲、且日內將有價値萬元美金之棉花運往央國、故市况甚趨活躍、結果收盤價格較之上日高漲的二十磅音、</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因投機者買　而漲、旋因獲利了結而回跌、最後又因空頭扺補再漲、結果昨日收盤價格尙平、漲落二羅比左右不等、啡昨日預測則父較之收盤價格上昇五羅比半、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉花交易、似因局勢並不有利、而紗市父起伏不定、故廠方購意頗感呆滯、連日仍僅同業間互做販買之零星交易、聊覺熱鬧也、</p>
<h3>證劵　甲乙債有吸收　—咋行市亦最好—</h3>
<p>公債　盤、昨日巿况先跌後漲、丙種至六元、午後仍高至六元四角、交易以午後爲多、聯益號對於甲乙兩種廣事吸收關係、代表某某等錢業、可謂精於選擇者、昨日交為、上午因北帮昌記賣出極湧、於是協康及一班散戶隨波逐流、紛紛求售、丙種最低價　降至六十六元、協大·甡昶·大德·久孚。乘低吸收、乃得善價、午後聯益忽有大批准胃、約四五十萬、甲乙種允感與趣、餘如天元同康益昌·及聯和准胃亦不弱、或補空或加碼、行市乃冉冉上升、賣力順泰·久豐·潤德·協興元·九成·等家供出爲數不多、丙種因多頭太多、故漲勢易於挫折、甲種因在五種公債中爲最優美之一種、故最爲人所選中、市價結果、漲跌互見、甲乙丙種上漲二角至六角、餘均小一角至三角、成交總數、的計一百萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交南洋兄弟烟草公司股五百股、價爲十九元七角、</p>
<p>又衆業公司股市開盤頗穩、後因浮多出籠、價格略趨軟化、倫敦十八日週三電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、仍吿平滯、英股稍見疲落、保安保險股跌一鎊、價爲二十三錢、麥加利銀行股跌二先令六便士、價爲八鎊十二先令六便士、有利銀行股除息後、新價仍爲十一鎊半、並無上落、其餘亦無變化、</p>
<h3>疋頭　東疋連跌回好　廠布都被帶起</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市趨勢轉堅、乃因東疋連跌兩天、昨突有同風、木廠布價都被帶起、浙　客帮雖不能裝貨、逢廉仍有採辦、交易稍增、白貨粗布平定、斜紋細布每疋漲五角之譜、富貴細布晨開四十三元二角半、午後增至四十三元七角半、漂染布大市平定、一部份色布每疋漲五角左右、本街成交各布五白餘件、浙閩帮辦粗布色布·細布等一百餘件、粵港帮辦藍布·綫呢。嗶嘰等二百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　昨因業內外心思向昂、成交續旺、取引所期貨細布回升每疋　一元、現貨龍頭細布收市價爲四十八元三角半、較漲六角、四君子嗶嘰高盤做開一元三角八分二五、收盤時一元三角八分、亦漲二分許、</p>
<h3>五金　黑鐵坯子一躍再躍</h3>
<p>邇來五金市面之向榮、創列來之新紀錄、各貨之標準超出二成一成者不足為奇、甚至有一倍二倍者亦常見不鮮、其中黑鐵坯子即屬一例、查是貨　情最初僅喊二千元左右、唯自最近以來、海外來源不充、　埠　底雖不薄、但經　戶　之再度搜吸、及製坯廠、印刷廠、鏡子廠、機器廠等之不斷採辦市上流通貨日感稀少、故執貨者心思奇昂、行情一躍再躍、昨巿每二千磅已需二千五百元光景、咬之前市所漲殊鉅、</p>
<h3>糖巿　初平後緊　期糖開數百噸</h3>
<p>昨糖巿初平後索、結果太車白B　嘜升數角、荷赤升三角、其餘無甚上落、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本棧八十二元、外棧八十一元四角。五角。六角。七角、三月底交割八十一元九角·二元·二元一角、四月二十日八十二元二角·三角·五角·六角、荷赤六十四元四角、升三角、太古車白B嘜西棧八十二元九角、八十三元、升二角、三月底打單八十二元半至八十三元、升五角、ＤＹ嘜東棧七十九元半、三月底打單七十八元九角、HX嘜西棧七十八元四角、荷粗白產電美金五·四五、生砂四·三八、荷赤四。五一、定四五月份裝船照C.L.F.K.G.例、天祥洋行開出數白噸、</p>
<h3>煤炭　白煤停止現售　—行情不抬目高—</h3>
<p>鴻基白煤、近日天暖、銷塲雖已落令、但　來源稀少、老單過多、日昨起行家停止現售、致人心惶惶、父起利多傳說、紛起搜羅、行情不抬自高、昨鴻基飾埠已喊三百元、加起二十元行情、本街門莊、照市酌加盤十、</p>
<h3>南北貨　普通枝看跌</h3>
<p>雜路枝普通貨、近乏續到、但以去化甚呆、故市勢反見平軟、聞今明日號方擬先開出一部份、市象看鬆、十的　必開跌云</p>
<h3>雜項　蔴袋由港運滬　仍受限制</h3>
<p>新舊蔴袋、近以到存俱薄、漲勢更勁、每只漲元許至數角不一、聞香港雖有許可出口之訊、但有限制、更須領事證明、始可裝申、故市面不因此而稍鬆、茲將各市詳誌如後、</p>
<h3>肥皂滯銷回降</h3>
<p>肥皂前數週因囤巨作祟、漲風甚勁、但實銷　屬有限、故目下有利可圖、遂有回出、行市反趨疲軟、昨如固本皂每箱做開四十二元、白祥茂皂每箱三十八元、黃祥茂皂每箱三十元、均較上週跌去二元左右、欲再上漲、　不易耳、</p>
<h3>甘薯</h3>
<p>— 高劍晨</p>
<p>要是馬鈴薯在歐美人食品中佔那麼重要的位置，眞堪稱得起「衣被羣生，瞻足萬類」了，那麼，在中國的植物中，能够和它並駕齊驅而毫無愧色的，無疑的就是我們熟知的甘薯了。如同馬鈴薯是從南美喬遷到北美和歐洲一樣，甘薯也不是我國的土著：它的開始卜居中國，的在公元三四世紀的時候；而它有一個　生兄弟名叫番薯或紅薯的，却是與馬鈴薯比鄰而居，也藉着西班牙人的提携，在十六世紀末，纔遠涉重洋的惠臨中國。現在且把它們弟兄兩個翩然來臨的經過談一談。</p>
<p>我國固有的塊莖植物是芋：史記貨殖列傳所謂『吾聞汶山之下沃野有　鴟，至死不飢』是也；又有薯預，平常叫作山藥，山海經北山經所謂『景山北望少澤，其上多草薩莫』是也。我國古詩人，因爲對於這兩種植物耳濡目染知之較詳的緣故，那麼，一旦和遐方異域的一種相似的新植物接觸，自然而然的要用熟知的名字去稱呼它，也拿固有械物的形狀滋味去和它相比，以期旁人的通曉易知。所以晋朝嵇含在所作的南方草木狀上說：「甘藷蓋薯孩之類，或曰芋之類，根業亦如芋。實如拳，有人如甌者，皮紫而肉白；蒸粥食之，味如薯蕷，性不甚冷。舊珠虛之地，海中之人，皆不業稼，惟掘地種甘藷，秋熟收之，…以充糗糧。……海中之人，壽百餘歲者，由不食九穀，而食甘藷故耳』。後魏賈思勰在齊民要術上說：『甘藷……月種，十月熟，……出交阯九眞』。唐人陳祈暢在異物志上也說：「甘藷出交廣。……其根似芋，亦有巨魁，大者如鵝卵，小者如鷄卵，剝去紫皮，肌肉正白如脂』。我以爲甘薯在「海中」，在「交阯　眞」的原來名字楚什麼，已不可得知；我們稱它為「藷」，爲「薯」，爲一山芋」的，完全是　舊有的名字强加在它的身上，是非常淸楚毫無可疑的了。（未完）</p>

<h3>兩租界公共車輛　昨晨又突吿罷工　英商公共汽車今日恢復　法電工潮雙方尙未談判</h3>
<p>法商電車公司及英商公共汽車公司全體工人爲要求改善待遇、於昨日起先後罷工、以致法租界有軌電車·無軌電車·公共汽車、以及公共租界各路公共汽車完全停駛、至英商公共汽車罷工風潮、昨日下午四時、經工部局工業處調解主任顧炳元之調解、商得解決辦法三項、於下午七時許完全復工、聞法商電車罷工風潮、法租界政治部進行調處、以免工潮擴大、影響地方治安及公共交通、</p>
<p>法電車輛　完全停駛</p>
<p>調解未遂　昨晨罷工</p>
<p>法租界法商電車公司之工人、因物價飛漲、生活艱難、允以米價騰貴、威脅最甚、乃向公司當局提出要求增加米貼、當由法捕房政治部於前晚八時、召集二人代表至政治部舉行調解、吿以公司大班法佛萊允將工人所提要求、定於二十五日答覆、但工人以爲資方毫無誠意、乃於昨晨七時許、全體四百餘人、先行罷工、十時四十分、行駛各錢之法商有軌電車、無軌電車、及公共汽車等上之司機、賣票員等共二千餘人、一致響應、粉粉停車、將乘客驅下、而後將各車棄諸街心、</p>
<p>各綫車輛　停駛途中</p>
<p>法租界各綫車輛停駛後、司機賣票、相繼離車、各車銜接途中、交通頓塞、愛多亞路上廿一·廿二路公共汽車前後相接、霞飛路·公館馬路·姚主敎路·善鐘路·及西門路一帶、所停者盡爲有軌電車一·二·七·十·五各路、菜市路康悌路口停有十八路無軌雷車八輛、安納金路南陽橋停有十八路無軌電車七輛、菜市路勞神父路口停有七輛、途爲之塞、此時公共租界之十七路無軌電車原駛至打浦橋者、一律停駛法租界、於大世界掉頭、直至中午十二時左右、公　特派出外籍工人多名、將停於路上之各車一律駛回呂班路車廠、每車由巡捕兩人保護、而捕房又派大批探捕在各交通路綫及車廠周圍嚴密戒備、</p>
<p>雙方尙未　進行談判</p>
<p>先是於　時半時、法電車及公共汽事一部份工人之未上班者、會集會議、討論罷工事件、衆信此次罷工顯有縝密計劃、而有若干「政治因素」在內、事發後、法電車公司當局與法捕房政治部卽設法進行調解、衆信工人方面提出要求十條、但其內容則始終未由負責方面透露、唯衆信以加薪資及米貼兩項、乃爲最重要之要求、據悉資方對於工人此次突然行動、頗表驚奇、但爲顧全大局計、有考慮勞方要求之意、而政治部叉從中斡旋、故此事或有圓滿解決之望、一般人士對所有工人、以目前物價高漲、生活困苦、故極表同情、唯深望所有工友勿爲人製造藉口、而臨人衆於不利、聞昨日下午法電車公司汽車工人仍舉行大會、商討對策、又聞昨日勞資雙方未曾進行直接談判、</p>
<p>汽車罷工　電車未停</p>
<p>公共租界英商中國公共汽車公司工人要求米貼及生活津貼、於昨晨十一時許、全體司機售票及銅匠等相繼罷工、以致各路公共汽車完全停駛、各路公共汽車除一部份駛返康腦脫路總廠拋錨外、其餘均停在靜安寺等一帶、並將路牌一律卸下、公共租界各捕房得報後、已嚴密戒備、允以公司之四週、戒備允嚴、至於英商電車公司各路有軌無軌電車、則照常行駛、惟中止駛入法租界、並爲維持公共租界交通計、臨時增加車輛行駛、</p>
<p>簽訂和約　宣吿解決</p>
<p>工部局工業處調解主任顧炳元、於昨日下午四時在沙遜大厦公共汽車公司寫字間進行調解、到公司經理安諾瓊斯。秘書寇禮·工人代表張阿慶·孫雲龍·等、以及范一峰、當得勞資雙方同意簽訂和的三項、宣吿解決、（一）三月份米貼暫照三月十五日以米價每石一百十元計算、暫發五十五元、准三月二十一日發給、並以三月二十一日工部局調查之零售米價爲標準、至三月底再行結算、少則照補、多則照扣、（二）四月份起米貼以每月十五日及十九日爲計算標準、並准每月之十九日發給、以工部局調查之零售米價爲標準至月底多則照扣、少則照補、（三）關於工人要求之生活津貼、公司允予考慮後、再行答復、</p>
<p>今晨完全　恢復行駛</p>
<p>公共汽車罷工風潮經調處、宣吿解決之後、即由工人代表通知全體工人、於昨晚七時起復工、銅匠以及司機售票即進廠復工、各路公共汽車、如一·二五·七·九·十·十二·十四·十五完全恢復行駛、自今晨起、公共租界各路公共汽車即可恢復未罷工以前之常態、至於各捕房對公共汽車工人罷工之各項臨時戒備、於工人復工後即行撤消、各界對工部局之迅速處理、得吿解決、均表欽佩、</p>
<p>台賑先匯六萬元</p>
<p>上海台災籌振會係浙省台屬旅滬同鄕聯合滬上各大慈善家所組織、於台屬各縣災悄奇重、特於前日（十五日）議決先滙款六萬兀、辦理平糶、一面仍設法勸募、</p>
<h3>廉恥宣傳會　昨遭搜查　傳帶去書籍證章</h3>
<p>昨日上午九時許有武裝某國人十名、分乘汽車至法租界捕房、要求派員往西愛咸斯路五〇〇弄二號內、大施搜查、結果在三樓內被抄出「明燈」小型書籍一千餘卅、「中華廉恥宣傳會」證章數十枚、帶入捕房、但該房內已闐無一人、故亦無拘捕情事、</p>

<h3>工部對米巿主張　確保合理售價　由兩董事研究合作辦法　着手新措置須事前佈置　局方自行採辦應巿最為上策</h3>
<p>對於穩定米市一節、各界莫不異口同聲、蘄求兩租界當局運用所有權力、疏通國內外米糧來源、嚴厲懲辦投機米盡、昨日公共租界工部局召開董事例會時、全市四百萬居民、亦莫不寄予深切之關懷、衆認當局對於懲辦米蠹、穩定民食、已具決心、今當局旣認抑平米價、穩定民食爲當務之急、故全市各界、一致深盼當局予以積極進行、期達宏大鵠的、抑近日工潮父復蠢動、莫不以米價高昂爲藉口、而暗盤貼費辦法、更予已經按照工部局生活指數發給米貼之各業、勞資間又生爭執、復起風波、此則仍有待於雙方之和衷共濟者也、</p>
<p>工董會議</p>
<p>工部局發表董事會討論米市情形云、查關於本埠米糧問題、業經本局董事會昨日例會討論、各董事對於改善米市需要積極而急速的辦法一層、一致表示同意、</p>
<p>研究合作</p>
<p>本局對於糧食小組委員會之各項報吿暨建議、以及上海糧食評價委員會致該委員會之函件、巳加以考慮、第以在着手一種新措置以前、此種措置、關係鄰界而應獲其合作者、認爲對於可望收效宏遠之各項建議、有重付研究之必要、此項研究工作、刻已請由董事兩人進行之、本局對於處置米市問題、不决當可決定、</p>
<p>注重供給</p>
<p>米價之高漲情形成為市民評論之的、而本局對於一般輿論、亦深爲感動、惟須知此項問題之癥結、在乎由產地遝米來滬、本埠充分存糧之維持、與夫米糧經由正當經營米業方面之分配與不斷的流通、彼眞實商人之經騐與善意、對於此項問題之仟何解決方法、確有必要、本局當與其通力合作、以便杜絕一切流弊、恢復米市之穩定狀態、並確保本埠有售價合理之充分米糧也、</p>
<p>囤米地點</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、上海米况、今日（十九日）更　惡化、蓋兩租界內出售各等米糧、已無確定之價格也、據未證實消息、前數週內抵埠之大量貢米、皆貯積於浦東與租界　局無直接統制權之區域內、觀察者相信、負責當局苟不在短期內採取嚴格辦法、則米價或將混亂、工部局全體董事今晨在局厦舉行會議、討論遏制米糧危局之方法、未證實消息、傳工部局或將決定採辦大量貢米、以解危局、</p>
<p>米輪駛滬</p>
<p>大陸報云、商界人士相信、華董虞洽卿或將再度提出上海設立公倉之問題、查此一建議、曾於兩月前一度哄傳、雖本市銀行界與商界、傳皆予此建議以强烈之後援、然發起人對於公倉之組織、迄未採取具體步驟、又據昨日消息、此間法當局已電西貢出口商、請其加速運米來滬、法當局且已請法航業商對此事予以合作、據航商聲稱、刻仍航行越南與上海間之法船、多數專運米煤、供給本市、法輪凱定號（譯音）載貢米一萬包、昨日午後抵上海、亞兩培沙魯特號、（譯音）載米二萬四千包、定星期六入口、懸巴拿馬旗其艾爾杜拉都號（譯音）</p>
<h3>一品香昨夜血案　兩男子遭擊斃　兇手三人係死者之稔友　入室談笑開槍後卽逸去</h3>
<p>前日（十八）中午十二時、有男子兩人、其一淸瘦、年的二十餘歲、又一肥胖、三十餘歲、至虞洽卿路一品香飯店開房間、當由侍者招待至三樓、開五十八號房間、循環簿上寫張人傑、年三十六歲、詛至昨晚十時半、忽有身穿中服外罩馬褲呢大衣之男子三人、前往該號房間敲門、當由兩男子招待入內、並命茶房泡茶、</p>
<p>談笑甚歡、茶房旋即出外、約十餘分鐘、後該號房間中、突有槍聲七八響傳出、稍頃、身衣中服之三男子、亦由該號房中匆匆出外、逸去無踪、事後茶房立即入內、見胖瘦兩人均倒臥於血泊之中、胖者</p>
<p>身中四槍、計右手兩槍、左耳部一槍、胸部一槍、瘦者後腦部中一槍、氣息奄奄、茶役見狀大爲驚駭、立刻報吿賬房、轉報捕房、派大批探捕前往調查、並急召救護車將兩人車送仁濟醫院救治、但因傷在要害、未及抵院</p>
<p>均吿畢命</p>
<p>曾經院中醫生檢　、實已無法挽救、兩人之屍體、嗣轉送騐屍所候騐、事後探補在該號房間中搜查當在桌上檢得書信一封、信封上面寫明寄交『廣西柳州羊角山凉棚隘二十六號</p>
<p>沙星如收」下書「馬司中緘」、並有大夏大學章程一份、瘦者被害時、身穿藍布夾袍、灰布短衫褲、胖者棉毛呢夾袍、灰色藍緞夾襖褲、至兩人被害原因、警務當局正在嚴密偵查、軟米的二萬包、則定今日午後駛到、</p>
<p>貼費稍戢</p>
<p>邇日米巿塲買賣、非法交易層出不窮、黑市「貼費」莫不飛騰、小絞米每百包竟被衝破四千元大關、即每包超越限價四十餘元、抬價漁利、殊堪痛心、昨晨米市開做後、初市即呈穩靜狀態、人心亦由緊帶軟、大戶將囤貨次第應市、市况卒徐步轉佳、結果黑市「貼費」、較諸前市面回降二三百元不等、即每包下落、三元、國米因到湧消呆、市價亦跟降一二元、但抬價收購之大鑫源和盛等、依然塲外交易、此則爲米價不落主因之一、</p>
<p>平飯增價</p>
<p>基督敎慕爾堂自平售白飯以來、轉瞬二年、迄未中止、貧民獲益殊非淺鮮、茲以米價在漲、故於昨日起、將售價改爲每市斤二角、（去年僅售一角於一月二十六起改售一角五分）、惟以購買貧民衆多、故提早於日光節的時間九時開始、一扮貧民、以此項平飯、較市依然廉宜、故購者紛至、竟有在三時半許、即携老扶幼、木立該堂門首、以期捷足先得、及至六時麕集者已不下五六百人、將該堂四週圍得水洩不通、後至者仍源源不絕、由此足證饑餓羣衆迫於生活者艱困之一般、</p>
<p>棄嬰慘劇</p>
<p>據大通社記者向普善山莊探悉、邇來經該堂收掩之露斃屍體、驟形增加、查屍體類別、則以孩童佔絕大數字、探究原因、不外米價高漲、貧苦家庭、不勝負担、頗有將出生嬰孩拋棄者、故此項孩屍中、不乏甫經絕命、或奄奄垂絕之情形者、據該莊紀錄、昨日在公共租界收掩一百十七具屍體中、孩童屍體、計佔九十五眞、此誠嚴重之社會問題、</p>
<h3>國際怪僧　照空已離滬</h3>
<p>國際怪僧空和尙、據大通社記者向本埠佛敎界探悉、已不在滬、其男女徒多人、亦均隨其出國、查照空在中國佛敎界、厮混甚久、任何佛敎集會、均有其參加、自此次歐戰發生、即鮮見其踪跡、當五六年前、照空曾一度離滬赴歐、卒以第一次歐戰時、渠曾有間諜嫌疑、而被逐回、其時渠即奢言將自造帆船、植渡歐洲、是項論調、旋即寂然、查照空原為匈牙利籍、在樓霞寺出家、其男女徒衆、亦均隸外籍、</p>

<h3>日方承認　磋商局董年選　但英日僑民仍準備競選　英僑決使現任英董參加</h3>
<p>本市日官方人士昨（十九日）晨承認關於四月二日與三日舉行之工部局董事年選事、英日僑民間巳進行磋商、據稱、本年度免不舉行選舉之問題、將全視英日僑民間仍在進行的磋商之結果而定、納稅日人堅持增加日董候選人、必不許本年度賡續維持現狀、欲使日僑同意維持目下之局董比數、唯有一法、即以大多數選舉票擊敗納稅日人是也、</p>
<p>日僑繼續　準備競選</p>
<p>又聞納稅日人刻正繼續進行其本年度至少舉薦三候選人之計劃、預料現任日董岡本與塙雄均將參加本年度競選、以便蟬聯、另添之日董候選人姓名、未經披露、聞英僑協會已向日僑建議、本年不舉行選舉、而由現任局董、全體蟬聯十二個月、惟日僑方面提出反建議、要求添增日董、按迄今爲止、僅美僑方面已推出明思德與阿樂滿兩候選人、</p>
<p>英僑協會決定計劃</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、英方負責人士稱、本巿英僑協會選舉委員會已決定使工部局現任五英董（首腦爲工部局總董凱自威）參與四月二日與三日舉行之董事競選、俾得再度膺選云、</p>
<p>英方否認　成立協定</p>
<p>英方負責人士並吾認得悉英日僑民間料將成立、「君子協定」事、查此說係昨晚傳出、內有按照該項協定、英僑將予讓步、俾一九四一年至四二年工部局日董得添增一二席等言、工部局董事競選、已定二十五日爲舉薦候選之截止期、</p>
<p>米基爾繼　任副總董</p>
<p>工部局日籍副總辦指宿氏、自於上月二十八日辭職、其繼任人選、曾經日總領署、推薦寺岡氏出任、茲據該局消息、寺岡氏現定於下月起、正式就職、又工部局董事會董事兼副總董卡納、自辭職返美、所遺職務、原定由明思德繼任、茲明思德博士因職務繁重、願爲衛生委員會等委員、至副總董一席、則推董事米基爾氏担任、</p>
<h3>虞洽卿　離滬赴港</h3>
<p>據確訊、公共租界工部局華董虞洽卿氏、業於本月十七日搭輪離滬赴香港、同行者有楊管北等、聞虞氏此行、將轉赴馬尼刺、並閒在未赴馬尼刺以前、或將赴渝一行、</p>
<h3>日本將發行　無息公債　票面定爲每張二元　有得獎二千元希望</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、日本將從本年五月起、發行票面日金二元之新公債、售予日本民衆、以圖籌集更多款項、彌補東京政府有增無己之經費不足、此項新公債、於五年內歸還、並無利息、但承購者有得獎金二千元之希望、</p>
<h3>漢口宜昌一帶　英商已陷絕境　長江迄未開放貿易無法立足</h3>
<p>據漢口路透通訊社消息、漢口英國商會於舉行本屆年會時、主席脫特氏報吿一九四零年英人在漢口之營業遭遇日方極嚴厲之限制、氏稱、宜昌方面之日本軍事當局、繼續不斷以</p>
<p>强力攫奪</p>
<p>英人船隻內之貨物、雖英方量高機關之有力代表駐內亦不之顧、此種侵犯中立國之權益、實無法認爲公平、關於漢口之英人商業、據脫特氏稱、現均遭受日方統制、除在當地賣買積聚貨物外、外人幾無法挿足、更因鄉村出產物之稀少、出口市塲全已停止、進口方面、英人亦無營業可供報吿、氏謂、在市塲上固可見到第三國之出品、然所有者皆爲經日本當局允許而由日人販運之貨物、大都自許爲質地良好或能塡補當地經濟之需要、脫氏繼謂、在長江下游、英人財產</p>
<p>仍被侵害</p>
<p>而無改善可言、日方一嚮宜傳開放長江、終未實現、故英方可活動之區域、在上海與重慶一千四百里中、僅一百七十里之地段而已、在刦後之揚子江流域、任令一國獨自肩負「復興」巨仟而不使其他各國自由營業、頗難謂有理由、據脫氏又稱、在過去一年中、除日本外、漢口幾無一艘外國船舶停靠、雖經數度磋商交涉、日人輒藉口「軍事上必需」爲理由、禁止吾人合法使用漢口之碼頭與浮筒、據悉、在宜昌一帶之英人與其財產、更因日方之統制及「絕交」、莫不受有甚深之痛苦與打擊、允以日常用品爲然、彼等且不准進入日人商舖內購買、</p>
<h3>東戰塲華軍　開始反攻</h3>
<p>東戰塲華軍、自經上官司令率部東進、計劃反攻、已與各路華軍取得密切聯繫、由忠義救國軍精銳部隊阮指揮爲先導、配合新軍、數共四萬餘人、配備最新式輕重武器、附有若干機械化部隊、暨空防戰具。重砲·戰馬齊全、紛紛往浙皖邊界、絡續抵達、預定地點、東進以來、先後收復七星橋·下間廟·平廣·金澤等重要據點、現正積極開始反攻、先後將丁部主力傭軍全部肅淸、後採取各個擊破、分將吳江·平望·崑山·巴城·茜墩·常熟·白柳口·靑浦·西岑等地帶盤據之周達民。任天石全部消滅、匪領周達民就擒、被俘允衆、業已分遺後方聽訓、加以感化、華方已化整爲零、分五路向滬郊各縣積極推進、已完成弧形包圍形勢、不久當有大規模之流動戰、惟據戰區來滬人云、華軍風紀嚴肅、途經各地、與當地武裝機關配合工作、致各地傭軍自動反正、預計半個月內、定有重大戰果、</p>
<h3>汽油漲價　每介侖加二角　車行考慮增價</h3>
<p>本市主要外商汽油行、昨日（十九日）一致通吿汽油每介侖漲價二角、據美孚油公司某員昨晨聲稱、不久又有汽油可抵上海、故料汽油不致缺乏、惟運費與本市耗費、近已高漲、汽油實有從每介侖三元四角漲至三元六角之必要、昨晨父據各出租汽車行方面聲稱、彼等不久將會同討論汽油漲價事、非至加以研究、而斷定汽油漲價後目下之收入、能否維持、則汽車租費、不致提高、</p>
<h3>鎭江旅滬同鄕會　昨開執委會議</h3>

<h3>美國加緊援華　愈離瘟疫極力壓倒極權　羅氏言論不啻一種保證</h3>
<p>美國對華援助現已趨於積極進行程序中、羅斯福總統私人代表寇利博士之來華訪問、研究經濟、作財政上之奧援、但寇博十離華甫抵檀香山時、某方有不利於華方之反宣傳、但此種無意議之宜傳、因羅總統在上週六白宮表示、聲明切實援華演說、可不攻自破矣、大陸報昨日社許、亦對羅斯福總統保證切實援華、有所論列、</p>
<p>援華諾言　卽將實施</p>
<p>寇利博士於訪問重慶陪都各地後、曾將此來所獲、報吿羅斯福總統、而羅總統則再度向傘演說、美國對華態度、此舉足可攻破東京報紙所發關於所謂寇利博士、有不利於中國之報吿、向羅總統提呈、在羅總統之對華演說、更表示將以援英同樣態度援華、此種諾言、不啻一種保證、羅總統雄才大略、善於辭令、爲舉世所共知、但並非健忘者、明日已忘却今日之所言、羅總統恒將其所言、施諸事實、言行必一致、此點可以已往事實證之、距今三年半前、羅總統會在芝加哥演說、美國將隔離侵略者之「瘟疫」、正力謀壓制極權國之發展、</p>
<p>獲勝信念　愈益將强</p>
<p>上週六羅總統在白宮舉行新聞記者聯合會常年宴會時、曾切實表示、中國幾萬萬人民、已在表示偉大之決志、反抗國內之分裂、中國在蔣介石將軍領導之下、請求吾人之援助、而美國業已聲明、中國必能獲取吾人之援助、吾國自當按照國民所願望者、切實爲之、民主國家之兵工廠、此種言語、苟由他人發表則實屬毫無意義、但今出諸美國總統之口、悄勢嚴重、必爲聯合之侵略國所感受、美總統本人立塲、已由美全民支持、而美國握有他國所無之工具、以實現總統之言論、三年叉八個月來、中國巳具信心、在茲次作戰中獲勝、而此種信心、已因羅斯福總統之最近言論、益加强矣、</p>

<h3>維持滬巿黑滙　決不放棄　平準基金充裕　維持輕而易舉</h3>
<p>平凖外匯基金委員會自得美國平衡匯兌借款五千萬美元、及英國匯兌借款五百萬英鎊、用以維持中國之匯率、實屬輕而易舉、蓋平衡基金、按照目前匯價計算達十五萬萬元之鉅、足能維持法定匯率、儘量供給各業正當需要、以及維持上海黑市之匯率、上海爲中國經濟之中心、租界地位中立、與其他淪陷區略有不同、所以對上海黑市之匯率、決予繼續維持、惟竭力防止套匯、並嚴格審核外匯用途、決不致放棄維持上海黑市、合法商人對必需品之輸入、得依法請求外匯、中國政府卽能供給較上海黑市爲高之商業外匯、此爲中國政府保護合法商人利益、可使遭受黑市損失之明證也、</p>

<h3>別離的心</h3>
<p>— 莫梓</p>
<p>今夜，我敎完了他的英文，他感謝地向我告別。我纔記起今天已是他這一個學習階段的「最後一課」了。明天他就要離開這裏，另外換一個職業。因為路遠的緣故，幾個月來繼續讀着的英文，也不得不中斷了。</p>
<p>我送他下樓，問他新居的地址，說有空要去看他。他謙遜地道謝着，一直到送出門去，讓聲音留在黑黑的衖堂裏。我的心裏感到一陣空虛，似乎担負不起這一個平易的別離，而深深地憶着往事。</p>
<p>半年以前，佩每夜都來讀一小時的英文，已經繼讀了三個月沒有間斷。她的進步很快·第二冊讀本快要讀完了的時候，她對我說：</p>
<p>「不久我就要離開這裏，到很遠的地方去，過愉快的生活。」我知道她是一個活潑熱烈的孩子，常常對我提起耐不住這裏的沉寂，要去過一點有意義的生活。我先表示對她的行動底贊成，然後對她說：</p>
<p>「你去了，每夜的功課也沒有了。我倒感到很寂寞。」</p>
<p>「不會的，我給你介紹……」她天眞的臉上露出愉快的笑，我疑心地在給我開玩笑，因此說：</p>
<p>「不要開玩笑，每天做慣的事突然不做了，不感到寂寞嗎？」</p>
<p>「誰和你開玩笑，眞有的事。我給你介紹一個學徒，他要讀英文呢。我去了，每天可以叫他來讀，你也不會感到寂寞了。」她的話　為正經而輕快。</p>
<p>於是她再告訴我她常常在那店舖裏買東西，和那個學徒漸漸熟識。最近他問她有甚麼地方可以補習英文，她便趁這個機會把他介紹給我。</p>
<p>第二天，她把那個學徒帶來，十六七歲的年齡，短小的身材，黝黑的面龐。他曾讀過小學，三年前便到上海來做學徒了。終日混在油醬酒醋中間，他躭心埋沒了自己的前途，所以正在另謀職業，想讀一點英文。</p>
<p>佩去了，我送她到門口，祝福她遠大的前程。一顆別離的心沉重地壓着我，但是我並不感到空虛，我仍舊可以在每夜的功課裏得到育實。</p>
<p>每夜他也是來讀一小時，我也以同樣的熱心敎他。</p>
<p>每天有幾次我都要經過那個店舖，如果在生意　空的時候，總是看見他捧着書本在讀。雖沒有一個　段的時間可以給他讀書，但是他的背誦，生字和解釋都做得很好。在生活的重壓下，他的求知慾格外旺盛，因此他的進步特別快，接受的能力，遠過一個初中的學生。</p>
<p>三個月過去了，第一本書快要讀完。佩在來信中也問起他，並且說自己在那裏生活得很好。我告訴他佩問起他的學業，他聽了很感動說：</p>
<p>「請你替我謝謝她的好意。不久我要到一家廠裏云做工，地點離這裏很遠，英文恐怕不能讀下去了，也請你告訴她」。我感到很驚愕，但仍舊鎭定地敎完他最後的幾天，他也聽得格外用心。</p>
<p>今夜，他誠懇地向我道謝，我倒慚愧三個月來沒有使他得到甚麼。我問他工廠裏的情形，他愉快地說生活比商店裏有規律，晚上可以自修功課。我為他從此能用雙手去推動生活的輪子，也推動着世界的輪子而感到欣喜。</p>
<p>別離夜的心情，使我感到寂寞的哀愁，而深深神經地追憶着半年來的經過。願他們的前途和生活都有意義，我留在這裏的空虛的心，還能够得到充實的。</p>
<h3>有一天</h3>
<p>— 俞允作</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（五）愛與慾的分野</p>
<p>他把右手托住了下頜，凝望着掛在牆上的兩支寶劍出神；隔室裏傳來的重濁的鼾聲，告訴他趙四和唱小生的李玉楨已毫無掛慮地走進黑酣鄉云了。這幾天來的奔走和爭執，雖然已使他同樣覺得很疲倦，但在他沒有把這一封信寫完以前，睡眠是絕對不可能的。</p>
<p>「連日進謁，得親　欬，　快生平；而女士之仙姿玉骨，蕙質蘭心，尤為僕所無限欽慕者……。」</p>
<p>第三張信紙似乎很可以順利地寫下去了，但經不起自己再把第一段重看了一遍，便又覺得萬萬不能合用；像這種肉麻的句子，不是那些捧角家所慣用，而為自己所最痛恨的嗎？自己畢竟還是個男人，還是個戲子，看了尙且不免汗毛站　，又怎麼能去唐突羅湘綺那樣一位端莊高貴的女性呢？</p>
<p>秋海棠的念頭才這麼一轉，那第三張信紙便又揑成了一團，被送入字紙簏去了。</p>
<p>眼看一本很厚箋簿，快撕剩一半了，他的疲乏的腦神經才為了他顯示了一個奇蹟，便他在短短的三四分鐘以內，寫成了下面這一封短柬：—長信的計劃畢竟是拋棄了。</p>
<p>「此次之事，多蒙助力，感激無由言宣；一切糾紛，日內可望結束，惟在返京前，尙有情相告擬請見約一談。（到府或他處均可）千乞勿却，並早日賜復是禱！僕吳鈞拜啟」</p>
<p>這樣他才覺得很滿意了，雖然他對於追求女性的事實在一些經騐也沒有，可是祇憑常理推測，他也知道與其繞着大圈子抄過去，還不是直接從正面進攻來得乾凈爽快。他想萬一對方眞沒有意思的話，祇要不給回信，自己就可以知道了。</p>
<p>「或許她不知道吳鈞是誰吧？」信封黏好之後，他倒又躊躇起來，因為吳鈞這個名字是他自己所起的，外人知道的很少，但秋海棠却委實不願用他的藝名或吳玉琴三個字和羅湘綺通信，因此仍用了它；依他的揣測，有那麼一打手帕和一瓶香水同時送云，再加上羅湘綺的聰明，她應該是可以猜到「吳鈞」是誰的。　（五九）</p>

<h3>蚊子戰艇</h3>
<p>— 今純</p>
<p>美國海軍部新近製造了一批蚊子戰艇，這是一種小巧玲瓏的裝甲戰船，長七十英尺，因為吃水極淺，可以自由通過魚雷封鎖綫，即放施魚雷，亦無可將它奈何。它的設備也極完備，上面裝有四口魚雷放射管，兩尊高射砲，六具水底炸彈施放器，還有放烟幕的設備。</p>
<p>蚊子戰艇的速度極高，航海程亦遠，計每小時可駛五十英里，航程最遠可駛五十英里，航程最遠可至二千多英里，迴旋　如，進退緩急俱可隨　操縱，非常靈便。而在一切的船隻中，獨有蚊子艇能效飛機那種側滑駛航。再加它船身　小，飛機若要用炸彈轟擊，或用　槍掃射它，都非常不容易。</p>
<p>蚊子艇的戰鬥力比魚雷驅逐艦强，但造價遠不及魚雷驅逐艦昂貴，即有損失時，駛駕的人員尚不及駕魚雷驅逐艦的人數十分之一，有烟幕掩蔽，又不曾觸到水雷，潛水艇一出水面就要遭戰艦轟沈，而蚊子艇輕便靈活，操縱得法時，自能擊敗大的戰艦。</p>
<p>現在美國海軍部正努力改良添製造這種蚊子艇，甚至於詡之為劃時代的新式武器。</p>

<h3>「中旅」的背水一戰</h3>
<p>— 守蕪</p>
<p>且說過云　中國旅行劇團再振旗鼓，將在下月十四日起在蘭心大戲院公演「洪宣嬌」了。昨天在光明咖啡館招待各報記者。</p>
<p>「中旅」成立到現在已經有了八九年的歷史，以功績言，實在不能算少，話劇運動在上海之抬頭及鞏固者，「中放」首次來滬時之長期公演，是一個有力者。那時候「中旅」眞是聲勢赫赫，現在流爲「秋風戲」的「雷雨」，便是由「中旅」的演出而震動上海的，可是好景不常，以後的「中旅」好像漸漸的在衰老下去，人事糾紛越來越複雜了，工作的精神也大不如前，乃至於有在香港時的十餘人難團而去的集體行動，好容易從香港到了上海，在璇宮覓得了立脚點，在困苦之中掙扎着公演了十四偭月，二月月底，却又突如其來的來了個天風公司接盤璇宮，於是，這有着相當歷史的中國第一偭職業話劇團，便又不得不揮淚別璇宮，另外去我他們的出路。</p>
<p>我們不必諱言，唐槐秋和唐若靑父女間，是有着若干的矛盾點的，該團重演「花木蘭」時唐若靑和唐槐秋的靈魂養家寳在後臺衝突，是其具體表現，而「中旅」停演以後外間紛傳唐槐秋將退隱，「中旅」由唐若靑主持之說，也都是由此而來。不過，父女究是骨肉，當此外來的危機勝過內在的矛盾的時候，父女倆的聯合陣綫當然很客易的結成，於是便四出奔走，一方面由唐槐秋去接洽院子，一方面由唐若靑去籲請魏如晦和費穆担任編導，不絕如縷的「中旅」的命運，便又有了生氣了。</p>
<p>而昨天在光明咖啡館宴請各報記者便是「中旅」正式向外界再振旗鼓的表示，同時爲證明他們「官報」的正確起見，還請了魏如晦和費穆與席。</p>
<p>喬遷和逃難</p>
<p>人席以後，四位主人彼此推讓了一下，終於還是推定唐「團長」「表演」，唐槐秋的話是很簡單的，他說：「剛才有一位老朋友進來時便向我問：中旅耍喬遷了？說到喬遷，我覺得還不如說逃難來得確當，金山王瑩他們在流動公演中到了什麼地方，便把「放下你的鞭子」那齣戲改了個名字，叫做「逃難到××」，我們這次也眞是逃難。今天請各位到這裏來吃一頓便飯的意思，很簡單，便是「中旅」道次要公演了，請各位多多的幫忙。』</p>
<p>他的表演完了，唐若靑說：「爸爸，你的「詞兒」沒有唸熟。』</p>
<p>唐槐秋說：「我演的是幕表戲，根本就沒有「詞兒」。』他想了一想，又站起來補充「表演」：</p>
<p>「我們這次演出，是「洪宣嬌」，是請魏如晦先生編劇費穆先生導演的，今天這兩位先生都在這裏。』</p>
<p>「爸爸」的女兒唐若靑</p>
<h3>劇藝新聞</h3>
<p>— 覺新</p>
<p>荀慧生已經到了上海，從明晚（二十一日）起在黃金大戲院登臺。據該院經理孫蘭亭表示，觀衆定座已經有八百客，很雞應付。慧生離滬八載，轟動自在意中，至於他的打砲戲仍是「鴻鸞禧」，在他成名以後，歷次來申演出，都是以這齣戲作爲打砲戲的。記得他八年前最後一次到上海，是廢曆元旦在天蟾舞臺登臺。</p>
<p>慧生在黃金演畢二十四天，再到更新舞臺演唱，這樣對於競邀的雙方，就都圓了面子。更新當局爲了慧生演唱的問題，曾和張翼臘開過好幾次的談判，請他暫時休息，等慧生演完以後，再行登臺，翼鵬本來是不願接受這個要求的，但究竟爲了情面關係，經數度的折衝，就答應下來。</p>
<p>翼鵬在輟演期內，積極排練二本「西遊記」，並且乘這個機會肅淸後臺，去蕪存精，使二本「西遊記」上演時，能够成一個完善的班底。至於二本的劇本，是吾請魏如晦加以改編，還未確定。</p>
<p>更新舞臺給翼鵬在輟演期內的包銀是三千元，不過慧生期內所得贏餘，也給他提出一份紅利，這大概也是一個「包銀」新紀錄。</p>
<p>有人提議請編導者「表演」，但都婉辭謝絕了。</p>
<h3>「洪宣嬌」的陣容</h3>
<p>在唐槐秋的報吿中，祇知道「洪宣嬌」的演期是下月十四日起，演多少日子及演員陣容，都沒有涉及。</p>
<p>據筆者探聞所得，則是這樣：「洪宣嬌」的演期預定九天，演員陣容，大致是這樣決定：</p>
<p>洪宣嬌（唐若靑）洪秀全（唐槐秋）石達開（邵華）李秀成（趙恕）楊秀淸（仇銓）韋昌輝（廖凡）蕭三娘（王薇）洪福（葛鑫）這裏面，龔家寳沒有戲，黃河已加入合衆，石揮則已考入了上海劇藝社，孫景璐殺近不知住於何處，所以也沒有戲。</p>
<h3>希望於「中旅」者</h3>
<p>這次戲宮事件，在中旅是一偭打擊也是一個刺激，不過多難興邦，古有明調，自此之後，唐氏父女旣結成了聯合陣錢，好好振作，當不難恢復過去的光榮，然而事在人爲，還望善自爲之，尤其是戲目方面，更要多一注意，再不要三翻四覆的專把「雷雨」「日出」「原野」「新梅蘿香」等幾個老戲「抄冷飯」，因爲觀衆看來看去老是這幾個戲，於「中旅」自身來講，在營業上也是失策的也。</p>
<p>「中旅」有着八九年的悠久歷史，運經苦難，而終於支撑了過來，這次又是一塲背水之戰，雖都是久經沙塲的老將，却萬萬大意不得，我們衷心希望「中旅」能奮發有爲，恢復過去的光榮，哀軍必勝，我們更祈禱此次的「洪宣嬌」能够旗開得勝。</p>
<h3>電影新聞復刋</h3>
<p>「電影新聞」每日刊第三期今日起繼續出版。有國片戲院爭映月宮寳盒等特訊及「相思寨」「紅拂傳」等電影劇本。讀者均可獲得陳雲裳簽名照及戲券云。</p>

<h3>「俠義雙雄」簡報</h3>
<p>「俠義雙雄」Boom　Town是米高梅傾全力攝製的巨片，主演的大明星有五位之多，除了克拉克蓋博史本塞屆賽克勞黛考爾白海蒂拉瑪之外，還有一位影壇巨宿佛蘭克毛根，它的陣容可說相當的堅强。</p>
<p>這部片子攝製了十個禮拜，成本是一百萬美金，外景二十七塲，鬥爭的劇烈塲面有五個，故事講的美國開採油田的經過，揮入男女的戀愛，朋友的義氣，情節曲折而有剌激性。</p>
<p>油田的噴口爲了逼眞起見，特地掘了一個油池，容積三十萬介侖煤油，裝了巨大的抽水機，起初擬用滲水的糖漿代替煤油，但是當地的居民因爲甜水將滋生蚊蟲，堅決反對，公司方面只得用眞正煤油來拍戲。</p>
<p>此片大華大戲院定於本星期六起獻映，座價略有增加，可說自「亂世佳人」後的又一部巨片。</p>
<h3>第三章　令人却憶平原君</h3>
<p>張蒼虬木來懷着盛怒，追到此間，一切都沒怕懼，祗尋厮殺。現在見這姓李的少年說話却很講理，一些沒有傲氣，只得按下寳刀，回答道：「俺姓張，名蒼虬，此番從鷄公山來，方才在一個新認識的朋友許靖家中留宿一宵，寳刀寳馬都是我的心愛之物。那姓許的也有一柄寳劍，我們曾彼此交換看過，不料被人家偷眼看着，便要來乘隙盜取。試想這種寳貴之物，豈能輕易被人盜去的呢？俺和許靖一同追趕，不料這位姓陳的又用喑器，把許靖打倒。俺因不蓋捨棄敵人，所以一直追趕到此的。」李信聽了張蒼虬的說話，便問道：「張壯士，你說的許靖，可是一個年少的書生嗎？」張蒼虬點頭道：「正是。他受了傷，俺還沒有去看他呢。」李信忙說道：「不好，這位許蜻也是我的朋友，不知他受的傷重不重？我們快快去我他吧。」張蒼虬道：「不錯。」遂跟着李信，一同開了園鬥，走出莊去。陳飛也和衆家人點着燈籠火把，一齊向前面那條來的路上走去。走得不多路，只見路旁坐着一個黑影，衆人跑過去，借着燈火光瞧時，正是許靖。許靖一見張蒼虬和李信走來，還有那盜馬的人也跟着在內，心裏好不驚奇。張蒼虬和李信都上前問他受的傷在那裏，現在覺得如何？許靖答道：「我受的傷還輕，箭頭幸虧沒有深入，已被我拔了出來，從衣襟上撕了一小塊布，自已把來紮住，便不流血了。不過方才跌倒的時候，幾乎發昏，等到我爬起來時，張壯士已不見了，所以我還坐在這裏休息着，沒有回去。怎麼你會和李兄一同跑來的呢？」李信笑道：「道就叫做不打不成相識了。」遂把張蒼虬追趕陳飛到他莊裏的情形，約略吿訴了一遍。許靖也說「巧極巧極。」陳飛因爲自已用暗器打傷了許靖，雖然人家不責備他，他心裏終覺有些對不起，便過來向許靖道歉。　（一六）</p>
<h3>奮鬥的人生觀</h3>
<p>奮鬥的果，不是奮鬥的最後一步，而是第二階段的基礎，也就是第二階段奮鬥的因，因成果，果又成因，因果互相聯屬，事實上分不出那一個是因，那一個是果，而奮鬥便成爲無盡期的進展。（宗預）</p>

        <h1>1941.03.20</h1>
<h3>U.S. Secretary of State Hull Announces: Loan-Lease Scope Not Limited to Europe and Asia; Cooperation with China on a Significant Scale; Strict Prevention of Aggressors Controlling the Seas</h3>
<p>Washington – Yesterday, the House Appropriations Committee approved the Loan-Lease Act appropriation of $7 billion, adding the comment, "In these perilous times, there can be no perfunctory measures. This sum must be the largest in peacetime history. We must undertake it, or we are no different from those who evade debt." The House began debating the bill yesterday. Simultaneously, the committee released testimonies from Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of War Stimson, Secretary of the Navy Knox, and Chief of Staff Marshall. Hull stated, "Our urgent task is to prevent those attempting to conquer the world from controlling the oceans and attacking any nation in this hemisphere. In good conscience, I must declare to the American people that I have determined that our country and our hemisphere are in grave danger. We must vigorously pursue all possible national defense measures with the utmost speed." When Congressman Cannon, a Democratic representative from Michigan, asked which countries the Loan-Lease Act would apply to and whether Asian nations were included, Hull replied, "Our business deals with the whole world. We are cooperating with China on a significant scale because China is also within the scope of resisting aggressor nations." General Marshall testified: (1) 95% of the weapons manufactured in the U.S. for transfer abroad are suitable for both American and British forces. (2) The entire $7 billion can be considered for the fiscal year from July 1, 1941, to the same day in 1942. (3) The government has drafted a plan to transfer the entire overseas customs fleet to the Navy Department, but there is no intention to implement it at present. (4) The food requested by Britain includes cheese, dried eggs, dried milk, pork, and canned goods. (5) The rotating turrets on American tanks are derived from Britain. (6) The current prices of war materials are much lower than during the previous Great War. (7) The goal of American foreign policy is to ensure the safety of American interests and independence, free from any threat. Congressman Woodrum, a Democrat from Virginia, strongly urged the passage of the bill, saying that the only result of full American aid would be the collapse of dictators. (United Press, 19th)</p>
<p>Washington – U.S. Secretary of State Hull announced yesterday that any nation resisting the Axis powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan would receive assistance under the Loan-Lease Act. Hull stated that China is also among the nations resisting aggression. Although Hull did not specify Japan, observers have noted that Hull’s words imply that Japan is one of the Axis nations and is attacking China. Secretary of War Stimson stated that the British Isles have become a crucial point upon which our nation's defense is based. Britain is planning to continue the war, aiming not only to save the British Isles but also to liberate European nations from their current subjugation and restore their free governments. Britain’s war will not end until these goals are achieved. (United Press, 19th)</p>
<p>House Debates Loan-Lease Funding; May Add Supplementary Clauses</p>
<p>Washington – As the House began debating Loan-Lease funding yesterday, it released statements made by American defense leaders during a closed congressional committee meeting last week. Defense Production Coordinator Knudsen stated that of the 764 American manufacturers currently producing or preparing to produce defense equipment, 61 are maintained by British funding. Budget Director Smith stated that Britain has placed orders in the U.S. totaling $2.7 billion, of which $1.68 billion has been paid. All items delivered to Britain have been paid for. Britain always pays 25% upfront for each order, with the remainder offset by British-held U.S. dollars. The British government does not currently have sufficient funds to cover new contracts. The $7 billion in American aid to Britain will be used to pay for British orders placed before the Loan-Lease Act was passed. At the beginning of this year, Britain held marketable securities worth $616 million and less marketable assets worth $900 million in the U.S. Britain's investments in Canada are nominally worth $2 billion and in South America worth $2.5 billion, but current market prices are lower than nominal value. Furthermore, at the beginning of this year, Britain held $292 million in gold, $54 million in official dollar deposits, and $305,000 in private bank deposits. Britain has provided capital assistance to American manufacturers totaling $171 million. Monthly war expenses for Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, India, and Britain total $175 million, with Britain paying $150 million alone. Canada will directly spend $1.4 billion on the war in this fiscal year. As the House began debating the $7 billion aid to Britain funding, the Appropriations Committee issued a warning that the funding must be passed quickly, or America’s international reputation will be affected. Therefore, the House should pass the bill immediately and only add the clause: "Any item procured under this act, if deemed necessary for American national defense, should be reserved for the U.S. government by the President’s discretion and not sent to foreign governments." This warning coincides with Prime Minister Churchill’s remarks in London regarding submarines and German activity on the American coast in the Atlantic. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>Dutch Foreign Minister Arrives in the U.S. from Europe; Will Proceed to the Dutch East Indies</h3>
<p>New York – Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens of the London-based Dutch government, accompanied by his wife, arrived here yesterday from Lisbon aboard the "Clipper Ship." He will proceed to the Dutch East Indies to "discuss official business with the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies." Kleffens stated that the Dutch government does not believe that Japan will attack the Dutch East Indies. "We have had 350 years of peace. I do not see any cause for anxiety." When asked if the Dutch government had requested other nations to protect the Dutch East Indies, Kleffens replied, "We cannot accept the protection of other nations, but if attacked, the Netherlands, Britain, and the United States can jointly protect our interests." (United Press, 19th) – Simultaneously released was information about a Fang-class cruiser active in the Atlantic off the American coast. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Washington – A report from the House Budget Committee states that the U.S. currently has 764 factories, 302 of which are government-owned. Among these, 97 are manufacturing aircraft parts and accessories, 80 are manufacturing cannons and ammunition, 12 are manufacturing armor, 40 are building ships, 20 are manufacturing machine tools, 9 are manufacturing optical instruments, 5 are manufacturing chemicals, and 7 are refining metals. In addition, 19 arsenals are being restored. (United Press, 19th)</p>
<p>Harriman Declares in London: U.S. and Britain Will Establish a Cooperative Committee</p>
<p>London – Roosevelt's special envoy to Britain for the Loan-Lease Act, Harriman, stated yesterday that a Loan-Lease Cooperation Committee will soon be established. He added that President Roosevelt will establish the committee for cooperation between British and American defense procedures. Americans will reduce food consumption if necessary, to supply food to Britain in the future. He specifically mentioned butter and milk. (United Press, 19th)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt stated yesterday that the U.S. is preparing to collect food needed by the British and other people resisting aggression, such as vitamin products. This food will be sent to Britain, but other democracies will also benefit. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>New York – President Roosevelt's special envoy, Donovan, arrived here yesterday after inspecting the European and African war zones for 26,000 miles, saying he had obtained valuable information for America’s defense preparations. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>New York – Colonel Donovan stated that he has gained experience that he hopes will be of great value to American defense planning. Donovan was the commander of the 69th Regiment of New York in the last Great War and is now a special envoy for Secretary of the Navy Knox. He traveled 25,000 miles in the war zones of Europe and Africa, observing recent tactics and visiting several political leaders. (United Press, 19th)</p>
<h3>Significant Development in the Pacific: A Squadron of U.S. Ships Visits Australia; Seven Ships Arrive in Sydney Today; Australian Government Prepares a Grand Welcome</h3>
<p>Canberra – After sending six naval vessels to visit New Zealand, the U.S. Navy has dispatched another squadron of seven warships, including the cruisers Chicago, Portland, and Clark, and the destroyers Sims, Hammann, Forrest, and Leary, led by Rear Admiral Newton, to visit Sydney Harbor tomorrow. The Australian Commonwealth government will formally welcome them. Acting Prime Minister Fadden has issued a statement saying, "After President Roosevelt's great speech to the world, the dispatch of a fleet for consultation is an unparalleled honor, and we are fortunate to be able to give them a warm welcome. The United States is truly a friend in need." (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Canberra – Australian Acting Prime Minister Fadden announced today that seven American warships will arrive in Sydney on Thursday, staying for three days. Reportedly, this is a training cruise, but the Australian government considers this to be an extremely important development in the Pacific. Minister for the Navy Hughes stated that this visit symbolizes the goodwill and friendly encouragement of a great democracy to Australia. Opposition Leader Curtin stated that the arrival of these warships represents the strength of President Roosevelt's words. Meanwhile, grand arrangements have been made to welcome the U.S. fleet.

<h3>U.S. Conducts Naval Exercises in the Atlantic; Reports of German Submarines Heading Towards U.S. Territorial Waters Confirmed by Undersecretary Welles</h3>
<p>Washington – The U.S. Navy Department announced last night that the Navy is conducting exercises in three areas along the Atlantic coast. The department emphasized that these exercises were planned long ago and are unrelated to reports of German submarine activity in U.S. territorial waters. The Navy Department warned merchant ships to navigate cautiously, as U.S. fleet submarines are currently conducting routine training exercises. The Navy Department stated that the submarine exercises are being held off Long Island Sound, the Florida Straits, and Cape Virginia. Meanwhile, naval sources here recalled that in 1918, German submarines operated in the waters near New York, sinking or severely damaging 100 ships, including the 13,000-ton U.S. ship San Diego and the 17,000-ton U.S. ship Minnesota. The latter struck a mine laid by a submarine. All German submarines returned home safely. German submarine activity near New York began in early June 1918, when survivors of the Haitian ship Deng reported that the ship had been sunk by a submarine. At the same time, the Gual was also sunk. As a result, the police ordered a blackout in New York and placed steel nets at the harbor entrance. Anti-aircraft guns were also prepared, fearing that enemy aircraft carriers might be accompanying the submarines. At that time, New York authorities planned to use tunnels as air raid shelters.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Japan's Calm</h3>
<p>The passage of the American Loan-Lease Act and President Roosevelt's important speech last Saturday are both highly significant events in American and world history. Beyond the meaning expressed in these actions or attitudes themselves, there is another even more important point: democracies today are no longer content with defending their own walls, but are taking the initiative by acting before aggressor nations can launch their offensives. In fact, in the European and African theaters, Britain, in addition to its existing active military operations along the Mediterranean, is focusing on defeating the weaker links in the Axis front as quickly as possible. In the Far East, China has long been preparing for a comprehensive counteroffensive. America's recent actions have all formed timely driving forces. In this respect, the aggressor front is clearly falling behind.</p>
<p>After this clear stance by the United States was revealed, every corner of the world has expressed a strong reaction. Democracies, whether fighting against aggression or still in a neutral position, have unanimously expressed their satisfaction. Among the aggressor nations, while resentment is the same, there are clear differences in degree. According to recent news, the Nazi side has not only used vile terms to attack, and rumors have emerged of a plan to sever diplomatic relations with the U.S. The confirmed movement of German submarines into U.S. territorial waters could potentially create a re-enactment of the Lusitania incident (which was the trigger for the U.S. entry into the previous war). In Japan, the attitude is far less agitated than that of the Nazis. The authorities have expressed calmness, saying that the U.S. President's speech contains no new elements. These differing reactions are not merely different expressions of surface attitude. They are not just because the status of the allies is different, or because American aid to Britain, Greece, and China has a different sense of urgency.</p>
<p>Comparing the situations in Europe and the Far East, although the Pacific involves only China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and Japan, unlike Europe, which has many fronts and several non-belligerent nations mixed in with subtle nuances, there are also certain unique factors that cannot be compared to the mainland. First, Germany's wartime international relations have long been established. Since the start of the war, other than continuing to expand its sphere of influence, there have been few new changes. Its relationship with the U.S. has long become a disguised severance, with a lack of normal diplomatic and economic relations. As for the Far East, Japan, not long ago, had not yet given up its illusions about the United States and continued to perform diplomatic charades. Even though commercial relations between the two sides have been tenuously maintained in an unconditional form, Japan continues to economically depend on the U.S. In recent times, although the Japanese authorities have been touting self-sufficiency and the establishment of a highly defensible nation, the actual results remain a mystery. Therefore, even today, Japan cannot but consider the possibility of further economic sanctions by the United States. Second, before the U.S. directly participates in the war, everything done against Germany, other than embargoes and blockades, can only be carried out through warring nations such as Britain and Greece as intermediaries. Direct contact between the two sides is temporarily unimaginable. In the Far East, while China has the same function as Britain and Greece in Europe, the United States itself has taken resolute measures to respond. From the passage of the large naval bill and the division of the Pacific Fleet, to the increased defenses of Guam, the Philippines, and the Aleutian Islands, and the recent joint defense by the U.S. and Britain in the South Pacific, and the recent visit by U.S. ships from Hawaii to New Zealand, all directly project the power of the U.S. onto Japan. Third, Hitler's work of managing the European continent and consolidating the rear is almost complete, and most of it is beyond Britain's reach. The final decisive battle between the two countries is clearly a different matter. However, the "Co-Prosperity Sphere" and "Cooperative Body" proposed by Japan in the Far East are still in progress, with few significant results. The implementation of this plan is also the key to the intermittent US-Japan relationship. At the same time, Japan's management of the Asian continent is clearly inseparable from the ongoing Sino-Japanese War. Fourth, the Loan-Lease Act itself is temporarily focused on aiding Britain and Greece, making it the most painful thing for the Nazis. Japan may not be happy to hear of President Roosevelt's clear expression of aid to China, but Japan today stands at the crossroads of invading China and advancing south. Some people within the country are advocating that it may be possible to abandon the invasion of China in order to advance south. Furthermore, as the Sino-Japanese War has reached this point, Japan certainly has some sense that the situation is no longer worthwhile. Looking at their intentions, wouldn't they think that even if China had sufficient war equipment to engage in a full-scale counter-offensive, as long as the democracies' fleet in the Pacific did not take decisive action, at most it would only be a matter of the Japanese army withdrawing from the Chinese battlefield? This would not impede its freedom of action at sea. Fifth, regarding the European war, the U.S. almost completely linked Britain's gains and losses to its own safety. In the Far East, compared to Britain, the U.S. has a slightly smaller stake in the Sino-Japanese War and a slightly more distant sense of safety. Because it is lighter and farther, it has been overlooked and disregarded by some Americans, and it is also the source of some of the earlier illusions that Japanese authorities had about the U.S. The above-mentioned factors, on the one hand, will make Japan aware of the seriousness of its future prospects and not dare to act rashly. On the other hand, they also indicate that Japan still needs to and may be able to delay its existing relationship with the U.S. for some time, to wait quietly for new factors and new changes in the future, with Matsuoka's visit to Europe and the imminent Anglo-German war being the main objects of its expectation.</p>
<p>In any case, America's recent measures and the display of its greatest resolve have already given it an advantage in the long-distance race between the democracies and the aggressor front. Regardless of how aggressors express themselves about this, it is predicted that they will not have effective countermeasures to counteract this. This will undoubtedly strengthen the courage and determination of some endangered nations, stabilize those who waver, and those who might help aggressors cannot but seriously reconsider their own steps and their consequences. The calm that Japan is desperately trying to show on the surface will inevitably be unable to completely conceal its inner pain and anxiety. The paths it can choose afterward are narrower than before, and no matter what it is hoping for, it can be asserted that it will neither be an unparalleled arsenal nor have the hope and strength to completely defeat the democracies. Twenty months ago, Terauchi Hisaichi and Osumi Mineo, who were dispatched by Japan to visit Germany and Italy, unexpectedly encountered the Soviet-German agreement in the middle of their journey. Matsuoka's recent trip abroad has also coincided with the US expressing its strong steps and determination. This can be said to be a common misfortune for the Japanese envoys visiting Germany and Italy, and it can be regarded as a historical coincidence, but it also suggests that...</p>
<h3>The Central Mountain Area: Chinese Army Launches Full-Scale Counteroffensive, Recaptures Important Strongholds, Japanese Troops Flee in Defeat, Chinese Army Breaks into Caozhang Town on the Tongpu Railway Line</h3>
<p>Xingji, the 16th. At dawn, the Chinese army in the Zhongtiao Mountain area launched a full-scale counteroffensive, first capturing the heights near Zhangma, which greatly benefited the Chinese army. They continued to attack various strongholds between Zhangma and East Songshuzhang, launching several direct assaults. The Japanese troops at Songshuzhang and both East and West Meng suffered heavy casualties and retreated to fortifications for stubborn resistance. In the Jiajiashan area (northwest of Shengshan Town), the Japanese troops launched repeated disturbances from the 15th, but were all repelled by the Chinese army, which provided aerial cover for their retreat to Shimenzi and Shitashang. After sweeping away the Japanese troops on the East and West Baoling, a certain unit of the Chinese army immediately attacked Heyuan (south of Zhangma). Zuojiawan was once infiltrated by Japanese troops on the evening of the 15th, but the front-line Chinese army recaptured it and took advantage of the situation to attack the area north of Zuojiawan. Fierce battles raged in areas such as Dananping and Tongkuangyong. Chinese officers and soldiers fought bravely and completely defeated the Japanese troops, capturing Washe Village.

<p>The Chinese Army Achieves Victory on the Huainan and Jinpu Railways</p>
<p>Lihuang. After suffering a major defeat in southern Henan, the Japanese, in an attempt to reverse their military decline, vainly hoped to consolidate their rule along the Huainan Railway line. At the beginning of this month, they began to attack the Chinese Anhui eastern positions, but were ambushed by the Chinese from different directions and suffered heavy losses. In order to understand the details of the battle results and the gains made by the Chinese side, this reporter visited a certain theater commander and asked about everything. He gave the reporter the following account: The Jinpu and Huainan Railways run through the southeast of Anhui Province, connecting Xuzhou and Bengbu in the north, and occupy a strategically important position militarily. Therefore, after the Japanese army occupied the strongholds along the two railways, they always wanted to consolidate their rule on both sides of the strongholds. Recently, the military situation in southern Henan deteriorated, and the Japanese troops attacking Womeng were once again defeated by our forces. In order to divert international attention and reverse the military decline, they gathered forces from various places at the beginning of this month, reaching 5,000 men, more than 30 artillery pieces, and a part of mercenary forces, and launched an offensive towards the umbrella-shaped area from Chuzhou, Quanjiao, Chaoxian, Hefei and other places, attempting to encircle the field troops on both sides of the Chinese railway, so as to achieve their dream of consolidating the rule of the occupied area. The Chinese side had already foreseen their plan and immediately waited in strict formation, dealing with it calmly. The Chinese army, distributed in various field units in the eastern Anhui area, waited for the Japanese troops to advance to Zhoujiagang, an area favorable to the Chinese, and then ambushed them from different directions, making use of the terrain to carry out inner-line operations, ambushing from both inside and outside, breaking through and eliminating them one by one. The battle was extremely fierce between the Chinese and Japanese. In order to achieve the predetermined strategic plan, the Chinese used powerful troops to attack the north and south sections of the Huainan Railway. At that time, the important stronghold of Dongchang on the Huainan Railway was recaptured, and at the same time, more than 20 li of railway tracks were destroyed, cutting off Japanese transportation and communication. The Japanese suffered a fierce ambush on the Chinese inner line, and transportation was cut off, causing extreme panic. On the 9th of this month, they began to collapse and retreat to the few remaining strongholds on the Huainan Railway. The Chinese army tracked and pursued them, and soon recaptured places such as Guhe. The remaining Japanese are now entrenched in the fortifications along the Huainan Railway, hiding and not daring to come out, like turtles in a jar. In total, more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers were killed in this battle, and as many as 400 bodies were burned at Liangyuan, which shows the extent of Japanese losses. The Chinese seized dozens of railway tracks, more than 300 catties of electric wire, and countless other spoils of war. Taking advantage of the victory, the Chinese army launched separate attacks and recaptured Wuwei on the 13th. The remaining Japanese withdrew from the south gate, and the Chinese are currently pursuing them. At the same time, due to the disastrous defeat of the Japanese, Japanese Colonel Fang committed suicide due to the defeat. Xiao Guolai's mercenary unit in Chaoxian County and Bai Ziming's mercenary unit in Dingyuan, both consisting of 300 men, successively surrendered. All of this is clear evidence of the Chinese victory in this battle, and from this we are even more convinced that the War of Resistance will surely be won and the nation will surely be built.

<h3>Rumors of an Imminent Completion of a Sino-British Alliance</h3>
<p>Chongqing. Well-informed sources here said today that Sino-British military cooperation in the Far East is gradually approaching a public stage. It is hinted that it is quite possible for Britain to conclude an alliance with General Chiang Kai-shek's army.

This cooperation is within the framework of the United States' South Pacific policy, the purpose of which is to maintain the status quo and prevent Japan from advancing south. It is pointed out that this Sino-British alliance will represent a program of British colonial policy contrary to that of the Chinese Communist Party, which believes that all colonies should be independent and autonomous.

<h3>British Troops Continue to Arrive in Greece; German-Greek Relations Tense; Nazi Action Against Greece Unlikely Before the Attitudes of Turkey and Yugoslavia Are Clear</h3>
<p>London – News from Germany indicates that diplomatic relations with Greece will soon be severed. A dispatch from the Turkish News Agency in Berlin states that German-Greek relations are extremely tense. According to official sources in Berlin, the relationship between the two countries can no longer be considered normal. It is believed that the German envoy to Greece has received detailed instructions regarding this matter. The Greek envoy to Germany has not yet left his post. A Spanish newspaper dispatch from Berlin reports that it is widely rumored in Berlin that there are now 300,000 British troops in Greece. A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry has declined to answer questions about Germany's intentions toward Greece. German newspapers and radio stations are currently conducting an anti-Greek campaign. Berlin views this as a sign that the German side will now handle the situation in Greece militarily. In the past few days, Italian troops have launched desperate counterattacks, suffering heavy losses. However, the German troops along the Greco-Bulgarian border have not launched an offensive against Greece, which has surprised many in London. It is believed that transportation obstacles are one reason for the inactivity of the German troops, and the resolute attitude of the Southern countries is also a very important factor. Meanwhile, a Swedish newspaper dispatch from Berlin states that Germany is currently engaged in diplomatic action aimed at obtaining a full understanding with Turkey. It is generally believed that Germany is currently hesitant and has not dared to take action against Greece, as it wants to be certain of Turkey's attitude. Responsible officials in Berlin have refused to comment on whether the reply of Turkish President İsmet İnönü to Hitler is considered satisfactory. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Budapest – According to news arriving here this morning, just as Greek reinforcements were rushing to the Greco-Bulgarian border, several dozen British troops entered Greece. At the same time, the Soviet Union's position in the Balkans is becoming increasingly important. It is rumored that Moscow has sent a written guarantee to Turkey stating that if Turkey is drawn into the war, the Soviet Union will remain neutral. Germany's actions in the Balkans today seem imminent. It is rumored that another 100,000 to 150,000 British troops have arrived from Cairo and landed in Greece. It is claimed that these British troops, including elite mechanized units, have mostly landed in Volos and plan to defend the second line of defense, which starts from Larissa, passes through the peaks of Mount Olympus, and extends to Florina and Prespa River on the Greco-Albanian border. News indicates that more Allied troops will arrive in the coming days. The Greek government has ordered all foreign reporters to leave Thessaloniki. (International News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>Istanbul – Travelers arriving here yesterday from Greece confirmed the news of the arrival of British troops in Greece. A traveler, who wished to remain anonymous, stated that he was forced to move out of his hotel in Athens on Monday to make way for British officers. The traveler said that the British troops arrived in Volos and then moved north to Larissa on Greece's second line of defense. It is said that the majority of these Allied troops are Australians and Canadians. (Associated Press, 19th)</p>
<p>Yugoslavia Determined to Remain Neutral; Rejects German Request for Passage</p>
<p>Istanbul – British and Turkish individuals here are reportedly excited by the news of British troops entering Greece and Yugoslavia's strong resistance to Germany's request for passage. Diplomatic circles claim that Yugoslavia has been calling up people for military service, and by the end of March, Yugoslavia could have 1.25 million armed soldiers. These individuals also claim that this army may be preparing to resist German troops entering Greece via Bulgaria through the Vardar River Valley to attack Yugoslavia. It is also rumored that Yugoslav troops have been concentrated in the area from Niš to Skopje and along the border with Greece. Yugoslavia's border defenses have been under construction for three months and are now being strengthened. These defenses include sentry huts. According to Axis sources, Yugoslav politicians who recently visited Germany were forced to allow Germany to transport weapons via rail through Klagenfurt, Maribor, Belgrade, Niš, and Sofia into Bulgaria. (Associated Press, 19th)</p>
<p>Belgrade – The government continues to remain silent about reports that Yugoslavia is negotiating with Germany. However, well-informed sources claim that an agreement between Germany and Yugoslavia could be signed within days. It is said that the negotiations between the two countries are now focusing on the Axis alliance, with reservations favorable to Yugoslavia. It is believed that these reservations are intended to prevent Yugoslavia from being drawn into the war, so the Axis alliance's conditions do not include Germany's passage through Yugoslav territory. It is also learned that while Germany wants to keep these reservations secret, Yugoslavia wants to announce them. (Associated Press, 19th)</p>
<p>Athens – The local press believes that Germany's demands to Yugoslavia include allowing German goods to pass freely through Yugoslav territory to Romania, allowing Germany to establish German hospitals in Yugoslavia, granting German wounded soldiers the right to pass freely through Yugoslavia, and it can also be assumed that German arms should be allowed to pass through Yugoslav territory to Bulgaria, so that the Romanian railways can be used exclusively for troop transport. It is believed that Yugoslavia will accept these conditions. It is also reported that Yugoslavia's mobilization is continuing. Well-informed sources believe that it will be extremely difficult for Yugoslavia to maintain its integrity, and a major German-Yugoslav agreement will be signed in the near future.

<p>Turkish Authorities Engage in Diplomatic Activities; Strengthen Defenses to Cope with Events</p>
<p>Ankara – Last night, officials announced that Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu had left here yesterday for Adana in the south, but did not specify his mission. (Haitong News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>London – It is reported that the Turkish ambassador to the Soviet Union recently met with Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Civil Affairs and Foreign Commissar Molotov separately. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Istanbul – Evening newspapers here report that Turkey's defense expenditures over the past year and a half have amounted to 500 million Turkish pounds. Note that this figure is an estimate. (Haitong News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>Ankara – Exercises by various units of the Turkish army in air defense and dealing with large-scale paratrooper invasions have been underway for several days and are now in their final stages. (Havas News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Will Not Stand Idly By Regarding Developments in the Balkans</p>
<p>Vichy – Diplomatic figures here have recently commented that Yugoslavia's lack of urgency in stating its position can be interpreted as Germany having neither presented an ultimatum to the Yugoslav government nor exerted any pressure on Yugoslavia. A spokesman for the German government has repeatedly stated that his country regards the Balkan Peninsula as its "living space" economically, and therefore hopes that the peninsula can maintain peace. Yugoslav newspapers also state that Yugoslavia is conducting negotiations with Germany on an equal footing. However, the reason why these negotiations have been delayed and unresolved is likely due to the following three reasons: (1) The Yugoslav government, regardless of what decision it makes, must first seek the unanimous approval of the entire country; (2) Before deciding on its attitude, Yugoslavia hopes to first know the outcome of the recent fighting between Italy and Greece; (3) Yugoslavia is somewhat influenced by foreign forces, which is worth considering. For example, British Foreign Secretary Eden did not go to the Yugoslav capital after visiting Athens, but only British Ambassador to Yugoslavia Campbell flew to Athens to meet with him. This is noteworthy item one. The Soviet Union seems to have adopted an attitude of indifference towards the Balkan Peninsula issue, but Soviet Ambassador to Yugoslavia Belonogov recently returned to his country to report on his duties, and immediately returned to his post after receiving new instructions from the Soviet government. Although it is not known at this time what kind of advice the Soviet Union has given to the Yugoslav government, Ambassador Belonogov was in Moscow at the same time that the Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union was conducting talks with the Soviet authorities. All of this can make the world believe that the Soviet Union is not completely indifferent to the Balkan Peninsula issue. This is noteworthy item two. (Havas News Agency, 18th)</p>
<h3>Italian Counteroffensive in Albania Again Defeated; British Aircraft Bombard Durazzo</h3>
<p>London – A Reuters correspondent reports from the Albanian border that Italian troops launched a strong new offensive in the northern sector of the Albanian front yesterday, but were again defeated and suffered heavy losses. Before the Italian counteroffensive, their artillery had carried out heavy shelling, and the fighting in the Tepelenë area was particularly fierce. There is a risk that a large Italian force in the area may be surrounded. Air activity has also increased, with the British and Greek air forces actively assisting the ground forces. It is said here that the Italian troops clearly want to break through the Greek lines on the 30-kilometer front near Tepelenë, or will redeploy sufficient troops to Tepelenë for another counteroffensive. There is currently no reason to believe that the Italian defeat will accelerate German aid to Italy. According to Greek radio, the Italian counteroffensive ended in defeat after seven days and is now much less active. The radio station also broadcasted a Greek official report last night stating that Greek patrols were very active. According to reliable sources, the Italian troops are attempting to reorganize their remnants, but the enemy army may not risk launching another attack after the reorganization. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Athens – British aircraft, under intense anti-aircraft fire, bombed Durazzo, an important Italian base in Albania, causing violent explosions and large fires. Another squadron of British aircraft attacked an Italian convoy on the Tepelenë-North Gravos-Buzi road, and all British aircraft returned safely to base. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>Turkish President's Reply Delivered to Berlin</h3>
<p>Berlin – A German Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed today that Turkish President İsmet İnönü has replied to a letter from Hitler. The Turkish President's reply has been delivered to Berlin, but its content and the state of German-Turkish relations cannot be explained. (Haitong News Agency, 19th)</p>
<h3>International Anecdotes (10): The Third Term of the American President, Roosevelt's Daily Life</h3>
<p>President Roosevelt had breakfast in bed at nine o'clock every morning, and his day of official business began from then on. The first to enter his bedroom were General Watson, the Secretary of State (in charge of the President's meetings), Miss LeHand, and Dr. McIntyre. When General Watson met the President, he didn't talk about official business, but started with a joke. Dr. McIntyre was an old friend of his, and every morning he would greet him and ask if he had slept well the night before and how he felt. Nine out of ten days, the President would say that he felt very comfortable.</p>
<p>After the usual morning greetings, "Old Joe" General Watson would present the day's list of visitors. The President would mark them one by one with a pen, with some visitors being received by him personally, some being seen by Secretary Early, or some being talked to by other officials. General Watson would always list those who had come from afar to meet the President at the top of the list, so that the President could make a decision first. Sometimes Roosevelt would instruct General Watson to add one or two more guests to the end of the list, which was truly like "knocking on the city gate," so to speak, a lucky thing. On Monday mornings, the list that General Watson opened up always had around fifty people, and not a few were eliminated. From this, it can be seen that the President, just in terms of meeting guests, was already busy enough.</p>
<p>At noon, Roosevelt would have his meal in the office, with various dishes delivered to him in a specially made insulated box with four wheels. Lunch would probably consist of a clear soup, an egg dish, a cheese cake, or lettuce. He did not eat sweets during the day, drank coffee for breakfast, tea after lunch, and a non-stimulating "Sanka" coffee in the evening.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, in addition to meeting guests, he also had to attend meetings, such as the weekly press conference on Tuesdays, the National Defense Committee meeting on Thursdays, and the Cabinet meeting on Fridays. As for talking with foreign envoys and receiving cabinet members, that was "commonplace." Recently, as international conditions have become more treacherous, meetings on defense and diplomatic issues have often made him feel overwhelmed, so he was often late for various meetings. For example, whenever he entertained reporters, he had no way to arrive on time. At a year-end conversation meeting in late December last year, he told reporters that in the new year of 1941, he would find a way to make up his mind and no longer make the mistake of being late, but he also said that although that was the case, he could not guarantee it.</p>
<p>Although Roosevelt was very busy with official business every day, he was still tirelessly hospitable, so time felt even more scarce. Some people described the President as being locked next to his desk, that he had the desire to see guests off, but not the strength to do so, but this was just an unreliable joke. In reality, General Watson often signaled to the President at an opportune time, asking him to dismiss the guests. Since the President was hospitable and loved to talk, if it were left to him alone, there would be no way to receive seven or eight guests in the entire morning. For the past eight years, Roosevelt has been energetic and hospitable as his life in the White House, truly worthy of being called a gifted person.</p>
<p>From 5:30 PM to 9:00 PM was Roosevelt's most leisurely time of day. He would take a short nap after a massage. Before dinner, if he was in the mood, he would personally mix "cocktails" to entertain guests. On the desk full of trinkets, there were many glasses and bottles, and he enjoyed mixing and stirring them. Dinner was a large meal, with soup, fish, meat, lettuce, and desserts. Roosevelt did not have much of a sweet tooth and often replaced them with cheese. Among all kinds of food, he had a special fondness for wild game and turtles, and received many gifts from all sides.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt liked to wear gray or blue suits during the day, and dark clothes, black ties, and soft shirts in the evening. Sometimes he would put on a black velvet jacket on the outside.</p>
<p>During his time living in Washington D.C., President Roosevelt rarely had the opportunity to leave the White House, except for traveling. He most liked to take the "Potomac" yacht out for a cruise on the weekends, or return to his home in Hyde Park, or take a vacation at Warm Springs, and occasionally take a cruise on a warship. He had a special interest in traveling, especially his love of yachting. During his first term as President, he converted a Coast Guard cutter, the "Electra," into the "Potomac," and every Saturday he would always take this yacht up the Potomac River, regarding it as his only pleasure.</p>
<p>The yacht was specially equipped with an elevator, which Roosevelt used as transportation when he went from the cabin to the deck to sunbathe. Whenever he went out for a cruise, he was always accompanied by four or five close friends. Everything was unrestrained and comfortable on the ship. Sometimes he would sleep in his bunk all day, reading books and newspapers, or playing with stamps. Sometimes he would enjoy fishing on the deck. He liked to fish for eels, thinking that they had an excellent flavor, not inferior to chicken. On Sunday mornings, naval aircraft would deliver all the mail and newspapers from the air to the yacht. The "Potomac" was often followed by the "Courier," which carried many secret service agents. When there was an emergency, the President would leave the "Potomac" yacht and board the "Courier" speedboat, which would go directly to the nearest pier, where he would transfer to a car and return to the capital.</p>
<p>On the surface, the yacht was only carrying President Roosevelt around for rest, and did not discuss national affairs on the ship, but according to unofficial sources, the decision of the United States to supply destroyers to Britain may have been made during one of these voyages.</p>
<p>If Roosevelt returned to his home in Hyde Park on the weekends, he always departed on Thursday evenings. Nowadays, because he is busy with official business, he rarely leaves the White House before Friday. He travels in a special train, which has a total of eight cars. The last car is a "Pullman" parlor car, where Roosevelt eats and sleeps. Counting backwards, the second car carries secretaries, stenographers, and guests. The third car is used entirely by secret service agents, who number eighteen. The fourth car is a dining car for the staff, and the two cars in front of it are used exclusively by reporters, photographers, film news photographers, technicians, postal workers, and railway employees. The seventh car in front has bunk beds for the staff and other secret service agents to ride in. The car immediately behind the train engine is half a club and half a luggage compartment. There are two white flags covering the front of the train. After departing from Washington, it rarely stops along the way except to inspect the axles. In the past, there was a lead car in front of the President's train, but now the special train often leaves after the ordinary passenger car has departed, and there is no need for an escort car. The railway companies, in order to show respect to the President, offer "cheap fares," offering a discount on ordinary car prices, and only charging some extra travel expenses for "Pullman" cars.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt himself rarely has the opportunity to come into contact with money. The only time he comes into contact with money is when he occasionally enjoys playing poker or bridge. The state provides him with a total of 30,000 US dollars per year for travel and official banquets, plus a bi-monthly salary check of 1,125 US dollars. After he receives these checks, he signs them on the back and gives them to Miss LeHand. She then gives them to a White House messenger, who deposits them in Riggs National Bank across the street from the White House. Roosevelt has been doing business with this bank for many years.

<h3>British Troops Victoriously Advance Closer to the Heart of Italian East Africa; Capture Jijiga, Not Far from the Ethiopian Capital; The Fortress of Keren Is Surrounded and in Dire Straits</h3>
<p>Nairobi – British Imperial troops are now gradually advancing closer to Addis Ababa (the Ethiopian capital), the heart of Mussolini's East African empire. Today's bulletin stated that the South African Air Force bombed the airport at Wajir, 120 miles east of the Ethiopian capital, on Sunday. On the same day, a train heading to Wajir was strafed by British aircraft and forced to stop. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Nairobi – It was announced here today that Jijiga in Ethiopia has been captured by British troops. The town is located 90 kilometers east of Harar and 900 kilometers from Mogadishu, the capital of Italian Somaliland. This important city is on the retreat route of Italian troops withdrawing from Babile and is only 250 miles (400 kilometers) from the Ethiopian capital. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>London – There is continued fierce fighting in the Keren area. Italian troops have launched repeated counterattacks, but have been severely defeated. In British Somaliland, British vehicles have been consolidating their positions since the capture of Babile. Within Ethiopia, British troops and Ethiopian patriotic forces are now pressing forward from all directions. The British advance from Italian Somaliland into Ethiopia is continuing. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>London – According to reports from both British and Italian sources over the past 24 hours, the city of Keren, upon which the fate of Eritrea, and even the entire Italian East Africa, hinges, is now increasingly in dire straits. To the north, British and French troops are currently traversing desolate mountains and advancing along the road to Keren. Some heights along the road, which are very suitable for defense, are still held by Italian troops. British troops have had to attack Italian positions that have been defended for months, and because the Italian troops number up to 30,000, which is more than the British troops, it is expected that the Battle of Keren will continue for several days. The Cairo military communique and the Italian communique from Rome both describe fierce Italian counterattacks against the British troops surrounding Keren, with heavy losses. A British Army communique released in Cairo states that British troops and patriotic Ethiopian troops within Ethiopia are continuing to exert pressure on the retreating Italian troops over a wide area, while British troops within British Somaliland are expanding their conquered territory. British troops in East Africa are currently clearing out the remaining enemy forces, and the number of captured enemy soldiers and war booty is increasing daily. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>London – Newspapers carry articles by military commentators stating that Italian troops within British Somaliland are currently being attacked by British troops from two sides and are unable to escape. One South African force, attacking north into Ethiopia, is currently approaching Jijiga, cutting off the road from Babile (the capital of British Somaliland), which was captured on Sunday, to Addis Ababa. Italian troops, who have recently withdrawn from Babile, may be forced to surrender or will have to flee into French Somaliland and be detained. Also, yesterday, British aircraft soared over the skies of Africa, bombing and strafing Italian positions, convoys, and troops. A recent communique from the British Middle East Air Force Command summarizes the British Air Force's battle situation as follows: In Eritrea, there was continued British air activity in the Keren area yesterday. Enemy troops and artillery on Mount Chelbred were subjected to dive bombing and strafing. The railway to the southeast was also attacked, and one Italian aircraft was shot down. In Ethiopia, enemy troops and transport vehicles in the Harar-Jijiga area were strafed by the South African Air Force. It was also learned that on March 13th and 15th, Italian aircraft engaged in combat with South African aircraft at Dagahbur and Diredawa, and four were confirmed destroyed. In Libya, on the night of the 16th, the British Air Force launched a heavy attack on the port of Tripoli, and bombs hit and set fire to ships, docks, hangars, and military depots. Explosions also occurred near railway storage areas and radio stations. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Hunan Provincial Administrative Conference Approves the Promotion of the "Teach Three" Movement; Textbooks Will Be Printed Soon; Focus on Popularizing Education for Illiterate People</h3>
<p>(Leiyang Correspondence) The textbooks for the "Teach Three" Movement in Hunan Province have been contracted for printing through bidding by the Department of Education. They will be printed and distributed to all counties in the province soon, and teaching will begin. As the movement is about to be launched, the reporter has compiled and recorded the provisional measures for promoting the "Teach Three" Movement approved by the Hunan Provincial Administrative Conference as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In order to gather collective wisdom and effort in this province to popularize remedial education for illiterate people and instill the necessary knowledge for resisting aggression and building the nation, these measures are formulated based on the plan for promoting the "Teach Three" Movement passed by the Provincial Administrative Conference.</p>
<p>(2) The educational administrative authorities of each county must, in accordance with these measures, recruit intellectuals to effectively promote the "Teach Three" Movement. In addition to maintaining close contact with the local garrison and various institutions, they must also instruct each Bao chief to cooperate with the local school principal or gentry to handle it.</p>
<p>(3) The term "intellectuals" in these measures, in addition to teachers and staff of schools at all levels, staff of social education institutions, and students of secondary schools and above who are already serving as prescribed social education workers, refers to civil servants of various institutions, staff of various cultural and industrial organizations, and other personnel who are at least sixteen years old and have received education of at least the fourth grade of elementary school.</p>
<p>(4) The Social Education Promotion Committee of each county should make every effort to assist in the promotion of the "Teach Three" Movement and list it as one of the central tasks of the committee this year.</p>
<p>(5) Each Bao chief, from the date of receiving the order to promote the movement, should, within half a month, prepare a clear list of the intellectuals recruited in the Bao and the three illiterate people they are responsible for teaching, including their names, genders, ages, and addresses, and submit it through the township head to the educational administrative authorities of the county for record.</p>
<p>(6) The recruitment affairs of various institutions and organizations shall be the responsibility of the persons in charge of the respective institutions and organizations, and a clear list shall be prepared and submitted to the educational administrative authorities of each county for record.</p>
<p>(7) Upon receiving the above list, the educational administrative authorities of each county shall immediately find ways to issue textbooks for public schools (Common Knowledge of the National Language) according to the number of students taught in each Bao or institution, divided into types A, B, and C. Type A consists of four volumes, with a teaching completion period of four months. Type B consists of two volumes, with a completion period of two months. However, if the textbooks are not easy to distribute at the time, the intellectuals should copy and teach them, or temporarily use enlarged miscellaneous characters to replace the teaching books.</p>
<p>(8) Upon reaching the completion period, a request should be made to the educational administrative authorities of each county to send personnel to test. If all can recognize the shapes of the characters and understand their meanings, the obligation is considered fulfilled. However, the educated person should still fulfill the obligation of "knowing and transmitting," and each person must transfer the teaching to three illiterate people, and so on. The educational administrative authorities of each county must also issue textbooks according to the names of the illiterate people taught as reported, so as to facilitate travel teaching.</p>
<p>(9) Intellectuals who are responsible for promoting the "Teach Three" Movement and have achieved real results may be rewarded by the educational administrative authorities of each county and notified to the original service unit as one of the considerations for performance evaluation. The rewards are divided into commendations and the issuance of certificates of merit.</p>
<p>(10) If the educated people have exceeded the completion period and have fulfilled the obligation of transferring education and the results are indeed excellent, the reward measures shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 9 of these measures.</p>
<p>(11) If the educated people have completed the term and the test results meet the provisions of Article 8 of these measures, their treatment shall be the same as that of public school students who have completed their studies and whose examination results are passing. The educational administrative authorities of each county may also issue certificates of academic achievement.</p>
<p>(12) The names, genders, ages, original service units of the intellectuals recruited each year, and the names, genders, ages, addresses, completion periods, and test results of the illiterate people taught shall be reported by the educational administrative authorities of each county to the Department of Education for record.</p>
<p>(13) These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation by the Hunan Provincial Government Committee.</p>

<h3>Tung Wah Issues a Seven-Point Statement; Lists Judicial Bias and Responsibility Issues, etc.</h3>
<p>Li Shijun, honorary secretary of the Tung Wah Football Club, made a statement yesterday regarding the unfortunate incident in the Yiyuan match. As various Western newspapers have made many slanders against Tung Wah, he specially put forward seven points to clarify the situation at the time and the issue of responsibility. The details are as follows: (1) The first goal scored by Tung Wah that was ruled invalid was scored by Jia Youliang. At that time, Dai Linjing was near the goal and did not compete with the Western District Police goalkeeper Boerping for the ball. (At that time, Kanaal pointed out that Dai had committed a foul by bumping into Boer.) The Tung Wah players initially thought that Dai was offside, which resulted in the award of a free kick. Only later did they realize that it was a personal foul, which was actually unfounded. (2) Tung Wah left the field because Huang Kehou and Boerping collided with each other. Prior to this, Western District Police center forward Willie Hauer had also violently bumped into Qin Bigao, causing Qin to almost fall to the ground. (This matter was witnessed by Chinese and Westerners in the field.) Kanaal only awarded a free kick. Why did Huang's foul receive a warning in addition to the penalty kick? It is obvious that the referee was unfair. (3) After Huang was warned, Dai stepped forward and said to Kanaal, "Such a common foul situation is given a warning, and the goal that has already been scored can be considered not scored. I don't know how to play." Upon hearing this, Kanaal ordered Dai to leave the field. As for the claim in the Continental Daily that Dai insulted and scolded Kanaal, it is absolutely not true. Dai has been playing football for more than ten years and has a general demeanor on the field. He has never been rude or behaved rudely, which is well known to Chinese and foreigners. Why did this competition deviate from the norm of the past ten years and insult the referee? It can be seen that what the Continental Daily claims is unreasonable in terms of both emotion and reason. (4) This A group final was an extremely important event. The Western League should have sent an extremely fair and neutral person as the referee. For example, in the international matches between China and England, Germans were used as referees and Italians as linesmen, which was very appropriate. However, this time, Kanaal, who is related to the Western District Police (Kanaal is a [blank] and works as a secretary in the Fire Brigade), was used as the referee. Sima Zhao's intentions are well known to everyone. (5) Some Western newspapers have attributed the actions of the spectators overstepping the rules to Tung Wah and claimed that the incident was triggered by Tung Wah's abandonment. Tung Wah cannot admit to this at all. Tung Wah is not a professional organization. The large number of spectators and the income of tens of thousands have nothing to do with Tung Wah. If there had been only one spectator in the field at the time, Tung Wah would have left the field and stopped the continuation of the game in a situation of unbearable patience. (6) Kanaal was the goalkeeper for the Western team and has always been extremely discriminatory towards Chinese people, considering them barbaric and rude. He has long had a prejudice in his heart. How can one expect fairness from Kanaal as a referee? (7) In the previous year, during the match between West Foss and Savaia at the racecourse, there was an unfortunate incident of violence. The referee was also Kanaal. This man is good at inciting incidents. In short, Tung Wah was first subjected to unwarranted oppression and then subjected to slanderous accusations. It is particularly painful to speak of it. The above statement is made to inform people from all walks of life, and I hope they will take it into consideration.</p>
<h3>Paramount Basketball Team Leaves for Hong Kong Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Oriental Basketball Team is going on an expedition to the Philippines and has telegraphed well-known players from Shanghai to help. Temporarily using the name Paramount, the entire team, including Dong Shouchun (manager), Li Zhenzhong (captain), Chen Xuechong, Zhang Shaoqing, Bao Songyuan, and five others, led by Gu Senkang, left Shanghai yesterday afternoon on the Taikoo Ming Sheng ship. No fewer than forty or fifty team members and friends went to see them off. The ship set sail at 2:30 pm. According to team captain Li Zhenzhong, who was about to leave, the trip will last for more than a month, with about eight games in the Philippines. After arriving in Hong Kong, they will also stay for one or two weeks to practice a little. Because the standard of basketball in Hong Kong is relatively low, they do not plan to hold any games.

<h3>Once Hoarding Stops, Grain Prices Will Drop Three or Four Dollars Immediately</h3>
<p>Yesterday, as soon as the hoarders of foreign rice eased their grip, market prices immediately fell. It is credible that the recent rise in rice prices was entirely driven by hoarding. Certain individuals, disregarding the food needs of Shanghai residents, not only blocked the flow of rice from inland areas to Shanghai but also drove up prices by buying in the market, fueling the hoarders' arrogance. In their minds, hoarding grain is a source of great profit, as secure as a golden city. In reality, it is exploitation of laborers and the common people, a sin incomparable to profits from other businesses. Most detestable are those who, while engaging in extreme greed, feign concern for the people's food supply, hoping to be remembered favorably, yet fail to consider the harm they inflict, leaving a legacy of infamy that will last for generations. This is far more dangerous than catching centipedes under a tiger's head. Furthermore, there are new hoarders who, driven by envy, blindly buy, driving prices ever higher, often creating unprecedented levels. Genuine merchants must still calculate costs and other factors. If the large quantities of rice stored in the city, held by these hoarders, were allowed to circulate, market prices could easily be stabilized. Because the hoarding slightly diminished, prices at the origin became higher, and they gradually declined. Transactions were scarce, and the black market prices for all types of foreign rice fell by three or four dollars. Small machine-milled rice initially cost 4,200 to 4,300 dollars, but now trades at 4,100 dollars, even as low as 4,000 dollars. Number Two Saigon is at 3,700 to 3,800 dollars. Number One Saigon, Siam, and fire-milled rice have fallen from 3,600 to 3,700 dollars to 3,300 to 3,400 dollars. Rice bran has fallen from 3,000 dollars to 2,700 to 2,800 dollars. Broken rice has fallen from 2,400 to 2,500 dollars to as low as 1,600 dollars, and so on.</p>
<p>Domestic rice like thick and thin japonica suddenly saw robust arrivals, coupled with falling black market prices for foreign rice. Both buyers and sellers became more cautious, so as sellers loosened their grip on slow moving inventory, thick japonica prices softened by one dollar per shi (unit of dry measure), regular Jiangsu rice traded at 107 to 105 dollars per hu (unit of dry measure), Kunshan rice ranged from high of 104 dollars to about 100 dollars, original price was around 105 dollars and as thin indica is more digestible, it suddenly dropped by two or three dollars, regular Qingjiao traded at 116 to 115 dollars per hu, original bag price was 102 dollars.</p>
<p>With glutinous rice mirroring the fatigue of other commodities, trading became even more scarce. However, holders, believing that supplies were not abundant, were unwilling to sell cheaply, so prices, though declining, did so only slightly. Hong Kong white glutinous rice fell from 106 or 107 dollars to 103 or 104 dollars, glutinous tea rice from 96 or 97 dollars to 94 or 95 dollars.</p>
<p>Large quantities of foreign rice have arrived daily via the French liner. The Ding, a designated ship, arrived the day before yesterday with 10,000 bags, already reported in the newspaper. The L'Aasia arrived at the port around 8 PM the night before last and is unloading at the Huashun wharf in Hongkou. More is expected to arrive continuously in the future. (Ancestor)</p>
<h3>Abundant Arrivals and Inventory of Foreign Flour - Wheat Remains Stagnant</h3>
<p>The foreign flour market continues to meander. As for sources of supply, Hong Kong transit goods are arriving in an endless stream, with three ships from Lisheng, Yusheng, and Taiyuan bringing a total of 44,800-plus bags, all of which have been unloaded. Currently, arrivals and inventory are both abundant, and there are no special changes in the market. However, the market briefly rallied after being excited by the rise in rice prices in the afternoon of the previous day. Yesterday morning, the asking price for Huabiao and Ao flour remained at 22 dollars 5.6 jiao (a tenth of a dollar), and Kan flour Jinlong brand at 31 dollars 5.6 jiao. Subsequently, prices eased to 3 jiao or 4 jiao as rice prices fell again. Prices varied slightly between market trading and direct sales to customers, as people are calmer and speculative trading has definitely decreased.</p>
<p>Wheat trading remains stagnant. As domestic production prices are high, arrivals are difficult. Wheat inventories in the concessions are drying up. The market can be described as "there is a market but no goods." Currently, Fufeng is closed, and Fuxin relies solely on foreign wheat for supply at flat prices. Only factories in western Shanghai and Hongkou are buying slightly, with prices remaining at 45 dollars 6 jiao. The prospects for the wheat market lack hope for improvement.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains - Weakening Momentum - Soybean Oil Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, markets for miscellaneous grains and soybean oil were unanimously down. Although corn prices are holding due to international issues, momentum for all goods has died down. People are unavoidably wavering, so small holders are not holding on and have started to sell. With weakening momentum, prices cannot help but decline. As a result, both futures and spot prices fell by around one dollar. Except for Guide soybeans, which continue to be supported by hoarders because of the demand from oil pressing factories, other beans continued to fall. Compared to the previous day, prices were reduced by a dollar or more. Soybean oil has been in a weak state because of pressure from the regulation company. Although there is support from hoarders outside the industry, sources of supply continue to arrive. Moreover, news that Han口oil, which had been delayed, may arrive any day has depressed people's spirits, and market prices have dropped sharply by two to four dollars.</p>
<p>Also, on the 19th, 1,200 cans of raw oil were imported from Qingdao. (Exported on the 20th) 565 bags of soybeans and 6,000 pieces of bean cakes were shipped to Xiamen. Another 4,000 pieces of bean cakes and 545 bags of sesame seeds were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Tightening Financial US Dollar</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed prices did not change. The black market for British and American currencies felt rather stagnant. However, trading was still brisk, as speculators sold off a lot during the day. Initially, the market was similar to the afternoon prices of the previous day because HSBC was willing to buy. Later, it was heard that Chinese banks such as the Continental Bank were aggressively buying, so the underlying trend became tight. The US dollar then returned from 5.4375 dollars to 5.40625 dollars. There was little trading in British currency. At the close, both currencies lacked upward or downward movement. As a result, spot British currency remained at 3 pence 3125, and the US dollar at 5.40625, compressed 0.03125. Futures were flat.</p>
<p>There were no changes in futures.</p>
<p>In the early morning, London silver, both near and far term, was flat, and New York silver prices were still flat. London raw gold was stagnant. The exchange rate of British currency against the US dollar was unchanged, but against Shanghai it was reduced by 0.0625. The US dollar against the British pound was unchanged, but against Shanghai it was increased by 0.04. There was no market for francs. The Central Bank's listed prices for various currencies remained the same. At the morning opening, the bank's selling price for spot currency was 3 pence 3115 for the British pound and 5.4375 dollars for the US dollar. Compared with the closing price of the previous day, both the British pound and the US dollar were flat. After the opening, speculators heavily sold off US dollars for January delivery, which HSBC bought at 5.4375 dollars. HSBC's listed prices for various currencies remained unchanged. There was no change in the silver equalization tax. Afterwards, although speculators sold, HSBC continued to maintain. Moreover, Chinese banks such as the Continental Bank were showing buying interest, so the market softened. However, there were no changes in futures. By the close, spot currency had aligned with futures at 5.40625 dollars. The spot currency was compressed by 0.01225. Futures for the British pound remained at 3 pence 2125. There was no market in the afternoon on Monday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Rates Unchanged</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 19th (Wednesday) Telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning. Only the spot Shanghai exchange rate fell by one dollar to 450 dollars. The rest were unchanged. At 11:30 AM, the spot Shanghai exchange rate rose by one dollar to 452 dollars. There were no other changes. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tianjin British and American Currencies Rise</p>
<p>Tianjin, 19th (Wednesday) Telegram: The exchange market opened weak this morning. The London telegraphic exchange rate rose by 0.0625 to 3.5 pence. The New York telegraphic exchange rate rose by 0.25 to 5.8125 dollars. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by 0.75 to 92.75 dollars. "Joint notes" on the black market rose by 0.85 to 72.40 dollars.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Stabilize</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market's raw gold black market turned from weak to firm, rising close to the 6,400-dollar mark, because the US dollar weakened and the Shanghai West Side gang suddenly stopped releasing gold. Initially, Xinyuan, Tianyuan, and Hengji small amounts fell to 6,350 dollars. Subsequently, after the bill merchants Dafeng, Xinfeng, and Yongzheng securities firms and money exchangers competed to buy, they rose to the 6,400-dollar level, where they were suppressed by sellers with price limits. In the end, they only rose ten dollars. Five or six thousand taels were traded in half a day. Sentiment was still stable on all sides. Switching from March to April, sellers still offered buyers a discount of 40 dollars. The cash market also turned firm and stable. Initially, Chengji offered 50 taels, 275 dollars higher than the futures price. Xianghe followed with 150 taels, and Hesheng with 110 taels, both 180 dollars higher. All were bought exclusively by Xiangxingyong. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday. The prices of gold ornaments and customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Rising Nearly 400 Dollars</p>
<p>In the early morning, the evening market on the previous day was unusually weak, with more sellers than buyers on the table, leading to the opening price of 6,370 dollars. After the opening, prices plummeted as Hengji, Dayuan, and others sold, falling to 6,350 dollars. It wasn't until an hour later that the market saw a high, with Zhongshengyuan, Dafeng, and Yida frequently buying, but the rise was extremely slow. After 10:30, prices gradually rose from around 80 dollars to 6,400 dollars. It was very difficult to break through the 400-dollar level, as Hesheng and Chengji were selling at that time, returning to 6,388 dollars. Subsequently, they rose again to 6,395 dollars, showing a fluctuating state. The result at the close was 6,3 hundred and twelve dollars, a rise of ten dollars compared to the market squeeze of the tenth. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday. The selling price of the present brand gold of cash houses was 200 dollars higher than the raw gold futures price, and the buying price was 80 dollars lower. There was no market for current standard gold, etc.</p>
<p>Jewelers' Gold Ornaments - Original Prices Unchanged</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael at jewelers has not changed. Datongheng quoted 680 dollars, and the new line was similar to the above price. The buying price was 30 dollars lower.</p>
<h3>Sudden Fluctuations in Foreign Currencies</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market's raw gold market turned from falling to rising. British and American gold coins also turned flat after falling. British notes remained stagnant, with the market only flat. American gold notes initially fell to 1.8 jiao and then gradually rose, the highest being 18.26 dollars, a rise of one jiao compared to the previous day's close. Hong Kong notes continued to rise, with market prices rising by one jiao. Japanese gold notes also tended to firm, rising again to 1.94 dollars in the evening market. The supply and demand for Korean notes remained balanced, with the evening market remaining at 1.6 dollars, the original level.</p>
<h3>Yarn Export Cotton Yarn - Factories Subsidize 60-70 Dollars</h3>
<p>The yarn market is still in a state of fluctuation. Although actual transactions have not seen a large amount of development, in order to encourage actual yarn exports, Shuangma factories single-handedly exchange spot goods, which truly proves that those with foreign packaging can be subsidized 60 to 75 dollars per package. Because of this, the thinking of speculators has shifted toward a higher view. However, the fixed amount of the securities gang is still in the switch period and can collect profit every day, so the yarn market at this 400-dollar level presents a tug-of-war. The high price of 20-count Shuangma yarn was 1,414 dollars, the low price was 1,395 dollars, the initial trade in the afternoon was 1,417 dollars, falling to 14 dollars, and the final price was 1,417 dollars. Also, 35 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Xiamen, and 605 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Shuangma opened in the morning, with a peaceful atmosphere, at 1,401 dollars, rising slightly to 1,406 dollars. Subsequently, the situation on the table loosened, and the short side became active, breaking through the 400-dollar level, reaching 1,395 dollars. However, as the gold market opened steadily, profit-takers patched up, and they rose back to outside 400 dollars, then advanced to 1,396 dollars. Subsequently, because of the rise in gold prices and the fact that actual sales were still good at the same time, they successively rose and closed at 1,414 dollars. A statistical breakdown of the amount purchased by each gang is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 820 Nanyang 350</p>
<p>Fellow Traders 5,800 Statistics 6,970</p>
<h3>American Cotton Continues to Rise - Domestic Cotton Sporadic Transactions</h3>
<p>The current cotton market situation is relatively high, and inter-industry buying and selling is very lively, so the industry is quietly firm.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market rose due to short covering and reports that China Plate announced the formal implementation of loans. In addition, cotton worth millions of US dollars will be shipped to the UK within the day, so the market situation is very active. As a result, closing prices rose 20 points compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially rose due to speculation, then fell back due to profit-taking, and finally rose again due to short covering. As a result, yesterday's closing prices were still flat, with fluctuations of around two rupees. Yesterday's forecast was five and a half rupees higher than the closing price.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions seem to be rather stagnant because the situation is not favorable and the yarn market is fluctuating. Factories' buying intentions are quite stagnant. In recent days, there have been only sporadic transactions between industry players, making for somewhat lively trading.</p>
<h3>Securities - Absorption of A and B Bonds - Yesterday's Market Also Best</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond market first fell and then rose. Type C rose to 6 dollars, and in the afternoon, it rose to 6.4 dollars. Transactions were more numerous in the afternoon. Lianyi, with its widespread absorption of types A and B, represented certain money changers and can be said to have been skilled in selecting them. Yesterday's transactions occurred because the north gang Changji sold extremely vigorously in the morning, so Xiekang and a group of scattered investors followed the trend and sought to sell. The lowest price for type C fell to 66 dollars. Xieda, Shenchang, Dade, and Jiufu absorbed at low prices, gaining favorable prices. In the afternoon, Lianyi suddenly had a large appetite, about 400,000 to 500,000, and was interested in types A and B. Others, such as Tianyuan, Tongkang Yichang, and Lianhe also had a strong appetite, either covering shorts or adding positions, and the market rose slowly. Suppliers such as Maili Shuntai, Jiufeng, Runde, Xiexingyuan, and Jiucheng provided a small amount. Type C was too long, so the rise was easily frustrated. Type A, as one of the best of the five types of public bonds, was the most selected. As a result, market prices showed mixed ups and downs. Types A, B, and C rose two to six jiao, and the rest rose by a small one to three jiao. The total number of transactions was estimated at one million dollars. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock transactions involved 500 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, priced at 19.7 dollars per share.</p>
<p>Also, the stock market of the Zhongye Company opened rather stably, but the price softened slightly after many floating shares were released. London, 18th Wednesday Telegram: The listed market for Chinese foreign bonds and Far East British companies' stocks remains stagnant. British shares showed slight weakness. The price of Baoan Insurance shares fell by one pound to 23 shillings. The price of the Macali Bank shares fell by 2 shillings and 6 pence to 8 pounds 12 shillings and 6 pence. The new price of Youli Bank shares after dividend payment remains at 11.5 pounds, with no change. The rest were also unchanged.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods - Eastern Piece Goods Fall Back and Recover - Factory Cloth Also Brought Up</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market turned firm yesterday because Eastern piece goods had fallen for two consecutive days. Yesterday, a sudden wind came and the price of cotton factory cloth was pulled up, although Zhejiang merchants cannot load goods, they still procure when cheap, and transactions have slightly increased. White rough cloth has stabilized. Twill fine cloth has risen by about 5 jiao per piece. Fugui fine cloth opened in the morning at 43 dollars and 2.5 jiao, and increased to 43 dollars and 7.5 jiao in the afternoon. The general market for bleached and dyed cloth is stable. Some colored cloths have risen by about 5 jiao per piece. Various cloths traded 500-plus pieces on this street. Zhejiang and Fujian merchants procured 100-plus pieces of rough cloth, colored cloth, and fine cloth. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants procured 200-plus pieces of blue cloth, woolen cloth, and serge.</p>
<p>Yesterday, because of the higher outlook inside and outside the industry, transactions continued to be brisk. Fine cloth futures in the exchange rose 1 dollar per piece. The closing price for spot leading fine cloth was 48 dollars and 3.5 jiao, a rise of 6 jiao. The opening price of Four Gentlemen serge was high at 1 dollar 3.825 fen (a hundredth of a jiao), and at the close, it was 1 dollar 3.8 fen, also up about 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Metals - Black Iron Billets Leap Again and Again</h3>
<p>The recent prosperity of the hardware market has created a new record. It is not surprising that the standard of each goods exceeds 20% or 10%, and even one or two times is common. Black iron billets are one example. The initial price of this goods was only about 2,000 dollars. However, since recently, overseas sources have been insufficient. Although the base in Shanghai is not thin, it has been repeatedly absorbed by merchants, and the circulating goods on the market are becoming scarce as billet factories, printing factories, mirror factories, and machine factories continue to procure, so the holders' outlook is surprisingly high and prices leap again and again. Yesterday, every 2,000 pounds required 2,500 dollars, a huge increase compared to the previous market.</p>

<h3>Sweet Potato</h3>
<p>– Gao Jianchen</p>
<p>If the potato occupies such an important position in the food of Europeans and Americans, it can truly be called "clothing and supporting all creatures, satisfying all kinds," then, among the plants in China, the one that can stand shoulder to shoulder with it without shame is undoubtedly the sweet potato that we know so well. Just as the potato moved from South America to North America and Europe, the sweet potato is not native to our country either: it began to settle in China in the third or fourth century AD; and it has a half-brother called the sweet potato or red potato, but it lives next to the potato, and with the help of the Spanish, it traveled across the ocean in the late sixteenth century to benefit China. Now let's talk about the process of their two brothers arriving gracefully.</p>
<p>The tuber plant native to our country is the taro: the "I have heard that under Mount Wen there is fertile land and water chestnuts, and you will not be hungry until death" in the Biography of the Moneymakers in the Records of the Historian is also; there is also yam, commonly known as yam, and the Classic of Mountains and Seas Northern Mountain Classic says "Looking north from Jing Mountain to Shaoze, there are many grass on it". The ancient poets of our country, because they were familiar with these two kinds of plants, once they came into contact with a similar new plant from a distant foreign land, would naturally use familiar names to call it, and compare it with the shape and taste of the inherent plants, in order to make it easy for others to understand. Therefore, Ji Han of the Jin Dynasty said in his Southern Grass and Trees: "The sweet potato is like a kind of yam, or a kind of taro, and its root is also like a taro. Its fruit is like a fist, and some are like a basin. Its skin is purple and its flesh is white; it is steamed into porridge and eaten, and its taste is like yam, and its nature is not very cold. In the old land of Zhuxu, people in the sea do not engage in farming, but only dig the ground to plant sweet potatoes, which are harvested in the autumn, ... to fill their hunger. ... People in the sea who live to be over a hundred years old are because they do not eat nine grains, but eat sweet potatoes." Jia Sixie of the Later Wei Dynasty said in Qimin Yaoshu: "Sweet potatoes... are planted in the month and ripen in October... from Jiaozhi Jiuzhen". Chen Qichang of the Tang Dynasty also said in Yiwuzhi: "Sweet potatoes come from Jiaoguang. ... Its roots are like taro, and there are also huge ones, the large ones are like goose eggs, and the small ones are like chicken eggs. Peel off the purple skin, and the flesh is as white as grease." I think the original name of the sweet potato in "the sea" and in "Jiaozhi Jiuzhen" cannot be known; we call it "potato", "yam", or "mountain taro", which is completely a strong imposition of the old name on it, which is very clear and beyond doubt.

<h3>Public Transportation Strike in Both Settlements Yesterday Morning; British-Owned Public Buses Resume Service Today; French Tramway Workers' Strike: Negotiations Between Both Sides Still Pending</h3>
<p>The workers of the French Tramway Company and the British-owned Public Bus Company went on strike yesterday to demand better treatment, causing the complete shutdown of trams, trolleybuses, and buses in the French Concession, as well as public buses on all routes in the International Settlement. Regarding the British-owned public bus strike, Mr. Gu Bingyuan, the mediation director of the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department, mediated a three-point solution at 4:00 PM yesterday. Work fully resumed at around 7:00 PM. It is reported that the French Concession Political Department is conducting mediation regarding the French tram strike to prevent the strike from expanding and affecting local security and public transportation.</p>
<p>French Tramcars</p>
<p>Completely Suspended</p>
<p>Mediation Fails</p>
<p>Strike Begins Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Due to soaring prices and difficult living conditions, the workers of the French Tramway Company in the French Concession, particularly those facing the most severe threat from rising rice prices, requested an increase in rice subsidies from the company authorities. The French police political department summoned two representatives to the political department for mediation at 8:00 PM the night before, informing them that the company director, Mr. Fafoley, would respond to the workers' demands on the 25th. However, the workers believed that the company had no sincerity and went on strike yesterday morning around 7:00 AM. At 10:40 AM, over two thousand drivers and ticket sellers on French trams, trolleybuses, and buses operating on various routes responded in unison, stopping their vehicles and forcing passengers to disembark before abandoning the vehicles in the middle of the street.</p>
<p>Vehicles on All Routes</p>
<p>Stopped Mid-Route</p>
<p>After the suspension of vehicles on all routes in the French Concession, drivers and ticket sellers left their vehicles one after another. The traffic was immediately blocked with the vehicles stranded mid-route. On Avenue Edward VII, the No. 21 and No. 22 public buses were lined up one after the other. On Avenue Joffre, Rue Cardinal Foch, Avenue du Consul General, Route Say Zoong, and the Ximen Road area, the vehicles stopped were all trams on routes No. 1, No. 2, No. 7, No. 10, and No. 5. Eighteen trolleybuses were stopped at the intersection of Rue du Marché and Route Conty, and seven trolleybuses were stopped at Nanyang Bridge on Route Annaquin. Seven vehicles were stopped at the intersection of Rue de la Gare and Route Père Huc, blocking traffic. At this time, the No. 17 trolleybuses in the International Settlement, which originally went to Dapu Bridge, all stopped in the French Concession and turned around at the Great World. Around noon, the Public Works Department specially dispatched many foreign workers to drive all the vehicles stopped on the road back to the Rue Luban depot, each vehicle protected by two policemen. The police also sent a large number of detectives to closely guard various traffic routes and the depot.</p>
<p>Both Parties Have Not</p>
<p>Yet Held Negotiations</p>
<p>Earlier, at 8:30 AM, some of the French tram and bus workers who were not on duty gathered for a meeting to discuss the strike. It is widely believed that this strike was carefully planned and had some "political factors" involved. After the incident, the French Tramway Company authorities and the French police political department immediately tried to mediate. It is widely believed that the workers have put forward ten demands, but their content has not been disclosed by the responsible parties. However, it is believed that the most important demands are wage increases and rice subsidies. It is reported that the company was quite surprised by the workers' sudden action but, in order to safeguard the overall situation, is considering the workers' demands. The political department is also mediating, so there is hope for a satisfactory resolution. The general public is very sympathetic to all workers, as prices are currently high and life is difficult. However, it is deeply hoped that all workers will not allow others to create excuses and put the public in a disadvantageous position. It is reported that the French Tramway Company bus workers held a general meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss countermeasures. It is also reported that the labor and management sides did not hold direct negotiations yesterday.</p>
<p>Bus Strike</p>
<p>Trams Still Running</p>
<p>The workers of the British-owned Chinese Public Bus Company in the International Settlement demanded rice subsidies and living allowances. Around 11:00 AM yesterday, all drivers, ticket sellers, and coppersmiths went on strike, causing the complete suspension of public buses on all routes. Except for a portion of the buses that returned to the Connaught Road head office and were stranded, the rest were stopped in the Jing'an Temple area, etc., and all route signs were removed. After receiving the report, the police stations in the International Settlement were closely guarded, and the area around the company was heavily guarded. As for the trams and trolleybuses of the British-owned Tramway Company on various routes, they continued to operate as usual, but stopped entering the French Concession. In order to maintain traffic in the International Settlement, the number of vehicles in service was temporarily increased.</p>
<p>Signing of Agreement</p>
<p>Declares Resolution</p>
<p>Mr. Gu Bingyuan, the mediation director of the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department, conducted mediation in the office of the Public Bus Company in the Sassoon House at 4:00 PM yesterday. The company manager, Mr. Anor Jones, the secretary, Mr. Courley, and the workers' representatives, Mr. Zhang Aqing, Mr. Sun Yunlong, and others, as well as Mr. Fan Yifeng, agreed to sign three points of the agreement, declaring the resolution: (1) The rice subsidy for March will be temporarily calculated based on the rice price of $110 per picul on March 15, and $55 will be temporarily issued. It will be issued on March 21, and the retail rice price investigated by the Public Works Department on March 21 will be used as the standard. It will be settled again at the end of March, with supplements for shortages and deductions for surpluses. (2) Starting from April, the rice subsidy will be calculated based on the standards of the 15th and 19th of each month and issued on the 19th of each month. The retail rice price investigated by the Public Works Department will be used as the standard until the end of the month, with deductions for surpluses and supplements for shortages. (3) Regarding the workers' request for a living allowance, the company will consider it and respond later.</p>
<p>Full Resumption of Service</p>
<p>This Morning</p>
<p>After the mediation of the public bus strike was declared resolved, the workers' representatives immediately notified all the workers to resume work at 7:00 PM last night. The coppersmiths, drivers, and ticket sellers immediately entered the factory to resume work. Public buses on all routes, such as No. 1, No. 25, No. 7, No. 9, No. 10, No. 12, No. 14, and No. 15, have fully resumed service. Starting this morning, public buses on all routes in the International Settlement will be able to return to the normal state before the strike. As for the various temporary precautions taken by the police stations for the public bus workers' strike, they were lifted after the workers resumed work. All sectors expressed admiration for the Public Works Department's prompt handling and resolution of the matter.</p>
<p>Six Hundred Thousand Dollars First Remitted for Taiwan Relief</p>
<p>The Shanghai Taiwan Disaster Relief Association, jointly organized by Taiwan natives from Zhejiang Province residing in Shanghai and major philanthropists in Shanghai, believes that the disaster situation in various counties in Taiwan is extremely severe. On the 15th, it was decided to first remit $60,000 to handle price stabilization. At the same time, efforts are still being made to raise funds.</p>
<h3>Anti-Corruption Propaganda Society Searched Yesterday; Books and Badges Confiscated</h3>
<p>Around 9:00 AM yesterday, ten armed foreigners in cars arrived at the French Concession Police Station and requested that officers be dispatched to conduct a thorough search of No. 2, Lane 500, Rue West Alexis. As a result, more than 1,030 copies of the small book "Ming Deng" (Bright Lamp) and dozens of badges of the "Chinese Anti-Corruption Propaganda Society" were confiscated from the third floor and taken to the police station. However, the room was empty, so no arrests were made.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Relocated to Hong Kong Urges Communist Party to Recognize Situation and to Fulfill the Promise of Joint Resistance Against Aggression and to Strive for Victory Under One Government</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, 19th: Since relocating to Hong Kong, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has continued its work as usual, making unremitting efforts. Recently, in view of the fact that seven Communist Party councilors refused to attend the second National Political Council due to the disbandment of the New Fourth Army, causing a bad impression nationwide, the Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram from Hong Kong to Mao Zedong and other seven councilors in Yan'an to advise them. The original telegram is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>To Councilors Mao Zedong of Yan'an, and forwarded to Messrs. Chen Shaoyu, Qin Bangxian, Lin Zuhan, Wu Yuzhang, Dong Biwu, and Deng Yingchao: Military orders need to be unified, and politics cannot be fragmented. This is true in ordinary times, especially in extraordinary times. Since your party published a declaration in 1937 to jointly resist aggression, it has been admired far and wide. Although the actual situation is not something that our Chamber of Commerce dares to speculate on, the actions of the New Fourth Army in Jiangsu, Anhui, and other provinces are closer and known in more detail. What we have heard and seen is inconvenient and unbearable to speak of. Since the Central Government has been forced to order its disbandment, some commentators still say that it is too late. Unexpectedly, you gentlemen want to use this as an excuse to abandon the promises made by your party before. It is inevitable that those close to you will be pained and your enemies will be happy. Moreover, democratic politics is the unanimous desire of the whole country, and the National Political Council is the only institution that expresses the national will at present. If you gentlemen have any opinions, you should submit them to the council for public discussion. We have never heard of treating the council as an enemy and first setting conditions to bargain, as if it were a market. Lightly starting a wall-quarreling dispute should deeply heed the warning of an overturned nest. What day is today? How can we allow ourselves to be mistaken again? If the entire nation perishes, we do not believe that any one party or one class can prosper and survive alone. As clear-minded as you gentlemen are, why do we need to nag? We hope that you will adhere to your original intentions, fulfill your promises, and strive for victory under one government and one military order. The future of the country and the nation deeply depends on it. We offer our sincere hopes for your consideration. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, respectfully, Qiao, (18th)</p>
<h3>Public Works Department's Stance on Rice Market: Ensure Reasonable Selling Prices; Two Directors to Study Cooperation Methods; New Measures to Be Deployed After Prior Arrangements; Department's Own Procurement for Market Supply Is the Best Strategy</h3>
<p>Regarding stabilizing the rice market, all sectors are unanimously hoping that the authorities of the two settlements will use all their powers to dredge up domestic and foreign rice sources and severely punish rice speculators. When the Public Works Department of the International Settlement held its routine board meeting yesterday, the four million residents of the city were also deeply concerned. It is widely believed that the authorities are determined to punish rice weevils and stabilize food prices. Now that the authorities recognize that suppressing rice prices and stabilizing food prices are urgent priorities, all sectors of the city unanimously hope that the authorities will actively proceed to achieve the grand goal. In recent days, labor strikes have been stirring again, all using high rice prices as an excuse, and the underground rebate method has caused disputes between labor and management in various industries that have already issued rice subsidies according to the Public Works Department's cost of living index, causing new disturbances. This still depends on the joint efforts of both sides.</p>
<p>Public Works Department Meeting</p>
<p>The Public Works Department issued a statement on the board's discussion of the rice market situation, saying: "Regarding the rice issue in this city, the board of directors of the department discussed it at its routine meeting yesterday. All directors unanimously agreed that active and rapid measures are needed to improve the rice market."</p>
<p>Study Cooperation</p>
<p>"The department has considered the reports and suggestions of the Food Subcommittee and the letter from the Shanghai Food Evaluation Committee to the subcommittee. However, before starting a new measure, it is believed that any measures that affect neighboring areas and require their cooperation need to be restudied to achieve far-reaching results. This study is now being conducted by two directors. The department will definitely decide on how to deal with the rice market issue."</p>
<p>Focus on Supply</p>
<p>"The high rice prices have become a topic of public discussion, and the department is deeply moved by public opinion. However, it must be known that the crux of the issue lies in the transportation of rice from the production areas to Shanghai, the maintenance of sufficient rice stocks in this city, and the distribution and continuous circulation of rice through legitimate rice businesses. The experience and goodwill of genuine merchants are essential to any solution to this problem. The department will work with them to eliminate all malpractices, restore stability to the rice market, and ensure that this city has sufficient rice at reasonable prices."</p>
<p>Rice Hoarding Locations</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" stated that the Shanghai rice situation is deteriorating further today (19th), as there are no fixed prices for the sale of various types of rice in the two settlements. According to unconfirmed reports, a large amount of tribute rice that arrived in port in the past few weeks is stored in Pudong and areas where the settlement authorities have no direct control. Observers believe that if the responsible authorities do not take strict measures in the short term, rice prices may become chaotic. The entire board of directors of the Public Works Department held a meeting at the department building this morning to discuss ways to curb the rice crisis. Unconfirmed reports say that the Public Works Department may decide to procure a large amount of tribute rice to alleviate the crisis.</p>
<p>Rice Ships Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>The "Continental Daily News" stated that business people believe that Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing will raise the issue of establishing public warehouses in Shanghai again. This suggestion was rumored two months ago. Although the banking and business communities in the city reportedly strongly supported this suggestion, the initiators have not taken concrete steps to organize the public warehouses. According to yesterday's news, the French authorities here have telegraphed exporters in Saigon, asking them to speed up the transportation of rice to Shanghai. The French authorities have also asked French shipping companies to cooperate in this matter. Shipping companies claim that most of the French ships still sailing between Vietnam and Shanghai transport rice and coal to supply this city. The French ship "Kaidin" (transliteration) arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon with 10,000 bags of tribute rice. The "Yalian Peishalute" (transliteration) is scheduled to enter the port on Saturday with 24,000 bags of rice. The ship flying the Panamanian flag, "Qiaier Duladu" (transliteration),</p>
<p>Underground Rebates Slightly Reduced</p>
<p>In recent days, illegal transactions in the rice market have emerged one after another, and black market "rebates" have soared. The "rebate" for small-grained rice has broken through the 4,000 yuan mark per hundred bags, which is more than 40 yuan per bag above the price limit. The price increase and profiteering are particularly distressing. After the rice market opened yesterday morning, it initially showed a stable state, and people's minds also eased from tension. Large households gradually supplied their stockpiled goods to the market, and the market situation gradually improved. As a result, black market "rebates" fell by 200 to 300 yuan compared to the previous market, which is a drop of three yuan per bag. Due to the stagnant sales of domestic rice, market prices also fell by one or two yuan. However, large buyers such as Daxinyuan and Hesheng, who raised prices to purchase, are still trading outside the market, which is one of the main reasons why rice prices do not fall.</p>
<p>Price Increase for Affordable Rice</p>
<p>The Christian Moore Memorial Church has been selling affordable white rice for two years without interruption, and the poor have benefited greatly. Due to rising rice prices, the selling price has been changed to 20 cents per catty starting yesterday (last year it was only 10 cents; from January 26, it was changed to 15 cents). However, because there are many poor people buying, it started earlier at 9:00 AM during daylight saving time. The poor people, with old people and children in tow, stood in front of the church as early as 3:30 AM, hoping to get there first. By 6:00 AM, no fewer than five or six hundred people had gathered, surrounding the church. Those arriving later continued to arrive, which proves the general hardship of the hungry masses forced by life.</p>
<p>Tragic Abandonment of Infants</p>
<p>According to a reporter from Datong News Agency who inquired at the Pushan Villa, the number of exposed corpses collected by the church recently has increased sharply. An investigation of the types of corpses shows that children account for the vast majority. The reason is nothing more than the high rice prices, poor families cannot afford it, and some have abandoned newborn babies. Therefore, among these children's corpses, many have just died or are dying. According to the villa's records, among the 117 corpses collected in the International Settlement yesterday, children's corpses accounted for 95. This is a serious social problem.</p>
<h3>International Strange Monk Zhao Kong Has Left Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to a reporter from Datong News Agency who inquired from the Buddhist community in this city, the international strange monk Zhao Kong is no longer in Shanghai. Many of his male and female followers have also left the country with him. Zhao Kong has been mingling in the Chinese Buddhist community for a long time, and he participated in any Buddhist gathering. Since the outbreak of this European war, his whereabouts have been rarely seen. As early as five or six years ago, Zhao Kong once left Shanghai for Europe, but during the First European War, he was suspected of being a spy and was expelled. At that time, he extravagantly claimed that he would build a sailboat and cross over to Europe, but this argument soon died down. Zhao Kong was originally from Hungary and was ordained in Louxia Temple. His male and female followers are all foreign nationals.</p>
<h3>All Sectors to Celebrate Tomorrow Local Restoration Memorial Recalling Local Glorious History and Firmly Upholding the National Policy of Resistance and Reconstruction</h3>
<p>Tomorrow (21st) is the anniversary of the recovery of Songhu by the National Revolutionary Army (yesterday's newspaper mistakenly stated that it was today). All sectors in Shanghai unanimously expressed their spiritual celebration without holding any ceremonies. Schools will also be closed as usual. All sectors will recall the glorious history of the area, firmly uphold the national policy of resisting aggression and rebuilding the country, and continue to promote economical donations and compete to purchase wartime bonds to complete the mission of national revival.</p>

<h3>Japanese Side Acknowledges Consultation on Annual Election of Public Works Department Directors, But British and Japanese Residents Still Prepare to Run; British Residents Determined to Have Incumbent British Directors Participate</h3>
<p>Japanese officials in this city admitted yesterday morning (19th) that British and Japanese residents are consulting on the annual election of Public Works Department directors to be held on April 2nd and 3rd. It is said that whether the election will not be held this year will depend entirely on the results of the ongoing consultations between British and Japanese residents. Japanese taxpayers insist on increasing the number of Japanese director candidates and will not allow the status quo to continue this year. The only way to get Japanese residents to agree to maintain the current ratio of directors is to defeat Japanese taxpayers with a majority of votes.</p>
<p>Japanese Residents Continue</p>
<p>to Prepare for Election</p>
<p>It is also heard that Japanese taxpayers are continuing with their plan to recommend at least three candidates this year. It is expected that the current Japanese directors, Okamoto and Hanawa, will both participate in this year's election in order to be re-elected. The names of the additional Japanese director candidates have not been disclosed. It is heard that the British Residents Association has suggested to the Japanese residents that no election be held this year and that all the current directors be re-elected for twelve months. However, the Japanese side has made a counter-proposal, demanding an increase in the number of Japanese directors. So far, only the American residents have nominated two candidates, Mindes and Alerman.</p>
<p>British Residents Association Decides on Plan</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Times" reported that British officials stated that the election committee of the British Residents Association in this city has decided to have the current five British directors of the Public Works Department (headed by the chairman of the Public Works Department, Keith) participate in the director election to be held on April 2nd and 3rd in order to be re-elected.</p>
<p>British Side Denies</p>
<p>Agreement Reached</p>
<p>British officials also denied learning of the "gentleman's agreement" between British and Japanese residents. It is said that this statement was spread last night, and it contained statements that according to the agreement, the British residents would make concessions so that the Japanese directors of the Public Works Department from 1941 to 1942 could add one or two seats. The deadline for nominating candidates for the Public Works Department director election has been set for the 25th.</p>
<p>Mikhael Continues</p>
<p>as Deputy Chairman</p>
<p>Mr. Ibusuki, the Japanese Deputy General Manager of the Public Works Department, resigned on the 28th of last month. The Japanese Consulate General recommended Mr. Teraoka as his successor. According to the department's news, Mr. Teraoka is now scheduled to officially take office next month. In addition, Mr. Kana, the director and deputy chairman of the board of directors of the Public Works Department, has resigned and returned to the United States. The vacated position was originally scheduled to be succeeded by Mr. Mindes. Now, Dr. Mindes is willing to serve as a member of the Health Committee and other committees due to his heavy duties. The position of Deputy Chairman will be taken by Director Mikhael.</p>
<h3>Yu Qiaqing</h3>
<p>Leaves Shanghai for Hong Kong</p>
<p>According to reliable information, Mr. Yu Qiaqing, the Chinese director of the Public Works Department of the International Settlement, left Shanghai for Hong Kong by ship on the 17th of this month. Accompanied by Yang Guanbei and others. It is heard that Yu will travel to Manila on this trip, and may travel to Chongqing before going to Manila.</p>
<h3>Japan to Issue Interest-Free Bonds, Face Value Set at Two Yuan Per Bond, with Hope of Winning 2,000 Yuan Prize</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that Japan will issue new bonds with a face value of two yen from May of this year and sell them to the Japanese people in order to raise more funds to make up for the ever-increasing funding shortage of the Tokyo government. These new bonds will be repaid within five years and are interest-free, but subscribers have the hope of winning a prize of 2,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>British Merchants in Hankou and Yichang Are in Dire Straits; The Yangtze River Has Not Been Opened and Trade Cannot Be Established</h3>
<p>According to the Reuters news agency in Hankou, at the annual meeting of the British Chamber of Commerce in Hankou, Chairman Tott reported that the business of the British in Hankou in 1940 encountered extremely severe restrictions from the Japanese side. He said that the Japanese military authorities in Yichang continued to</p>
<p>forcibly seize</p>
<p>the goods in British ships, even though a powerful representative of the British authorities was stationed there. This infringement of the rights of neutral countries cannot be considered fair. Regarding the business of the British in Hankou, Tott said that it is now under Japanese control. Foreigners have almost no way to intervene except to buy and sell accumulated goods locally. Moreover, due to the scarcity of rural products, the export market has completely stopped. On the import side, the British have no business to report. He said that products from third countries can be seen in the market, but all are goods transported by the Japanese with the permission of the Japanese authorities, mostly claiming to be of good quality or able to fill the local economic needs. Tott continued, in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, British property</p>
<p>is still being infringed</p>
<p>and there is no improvement. The Japanese side has always promoted the opening of the Yangtze River, but it has never been realized. Therefore, the area where the British can operate is only 170 miles of the 1,400-mile section between Shanghai and Chongqing. In the looted Yangtze River basin, it is difficult to say that there is reason to let one country alone shoulder the "revival" giant without allowing other countries to operate freely. According to Tott, in the past year, except for Japan, almost no foreign ships have docked in Hankou. Although several consultations and negotiations have been conducted, the Japanese have always used the excuse of "military necessity" to prohibit us from legally using Hankou's docks and pontoons. It is reported that the British and their property in the Yichang area have suffered deeply from the Japanese control and "severance," especially daily necessities. They are not even allowed to enter Japanese shops to buy them.</p>
<h3>Bloody Incident at Yipinxiang Last Night; Two Men Shot Dead; Three Murderers Are Close Friends of the Deceased; Entered the Room Talking and Laughing, Then Opened Fire and Fled</h3>
<p>At noon on the 18th, two men, one thin, in his twenties, and one fat, in his thirties, went to the Yipinxiang Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road to open a room. They were taken to the third floor by a waiter and opened room 58. Zhang Renjie, 36 years old, was written on the registration book. Until 10:30 PM last night, three men wearing Chinese clothes and overcoats went to the room and knocked on the door. The two men invited them in and ordered tea.</p>
<p>They talked and laughed very happily. The waiter then went out. About ten minutes later, seven or eight gunshots suddenly rang out from the room. Shortly after, the three men in Chinese clothes hurriedly left the room and fled without a trace. The waiter immediately entered the room and saw that both the fat and thin men were lying in pools of blood. The fat man</p>
<p>had four shots in his body: two in his right hand, one in his left ear, and one in his chest. The thin man had one shot in the back of his head and was barely breathing. The waiter was shocked and immediately reported it to the cashier, who reported it to the police. A large number of detectives were dispatched to investigate, and an ambulance was urgently called to transport the two men to Renji Hospital for treatment, but because the injuries were critical, they did not arrive at the hospital</p>
<p>and both died</p>
<p>After examination by the hospital doctors, it was impossible to save them. The bodies of the two men were then transferred to the morgue for autopsy. After the incident, the detectives found a letter on the table in the room. The envelope was addressed to "Sha Xingru, No. 26, Liangpeng Pass, Yangjiao Mountain, Liuzhou, Guangxi," and below it was written "Ma Sisi Sealed." There was also a copy of the constitution of Great China University. When the thin man was killed, he was wearing a blue cloth lined robe and gray cloth shirt and pants. The fat man was wearing a cotton flannel lined robe and gray blue satin lined jacket and pants. The police authorities are conducting a thorough investigation into the cause of the deaths of the two men. 20,000 bags of soft rice are scheduled to arrive this afternoon.</p>
<p>Underground Rebates Slightly Reduced</p>
<p>In recent days, illegal transactions in the rice market have emerged one after another, and black market "rebates" have soared. The "rebate" for small-grained rice has broken through the 4,000 yuan mark per hundred bags, which is more than 40 yuan per bag above the price limit. The price increase and profiteering are particularly distressing. After the rice market opened yesterday morning, it initially showed a stable state, and people's minds also eased from tension. Large households gradually supplied their stockpiled goods to the market, and the market situation gradually improved. As a result, black market "rebates" fell by 200 to 300 yuan compared to the previous market, which is a drop of three yuan per bag. Due to the stagnant sales of domestic rice, market prices also fell by one or two yuan. However, large buyers such as Daxinyuan and Hesheng, who raised prices to purchase, are still trading outside the market, which is one of the main reasons why rice prices do not fall.</p>
<p>Price Increase for Affordable Rice</p>
<p>The Christian Moore Memorial Church has been selling affordable white rice for two years without interruption, and the poor have benefited greatly. Due to rising rice prices, the selling price has been changed to 20 cents per catty starting yesterday (last year it was only 10 cents; from January 26, it was changed to 15 cents). However, because there are many poor people buying, it started earlier at 9:00 AM during daylight saving time. The poor people, with old people and children in tow, stood in front of the church as early as 3:30 AM, hoping to get there first. By 6:00 AM, no fewer than five or six hundred people had gathered, surrounding the church. Those arriving later continued to arrive, which proves the general hardship of the hungry masses forced by life.</p>
<p>Tragic Abandonment of Infants</p>
<p>According to a reporter from Datong News Agency who inquired at the Pushan Villa, the number of exposed corpses collected by the church recently has increased sharply. An investigation of the types of corpses shows that children account for the vast majority. The reason is nothing more than the high rice prices, poor families cannot afford it, and some have abandoned newborn babies. Therefore, among these children's corpses, many have just died or are dying. According to the villa's records, among the 117 corpses collected in the International Settlement yesterday, children's corpses accounted for 95. This is a serious social problem.</p>
<h3>International Strange Monk Zhao Kong Has Left Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to a reporter from Datong News Agency who inquired from the Buddhist community in this city, the international strange monk Zhao Kong is no longer in Shanghai. Many of his male and female followers have also left the country with him. Zhao Kong has been mingling in the Chinese Buddhist community for a long time, and he participated in any Buddhist gathering. Since the outbreak of this European war, his whereabouts have been rarely seen. As early as five or six years ago, Zhao Kong once left Shanghai for Europe, but during the First European War, he was suspected of being a spy and was expelled. At that time, he extravagantly claimed that he would build a sailboat and cross over to Europe, but this argument soon died down. Zhao Kong was originally from Hungary and was ordained in Louxia Temple. His male and female followers are all foreign nationals.</p>
<h3>All Sectors to Celebrate Tomorrow Local Restoration Memorial Recalling Local Glorious History and Firmly Upholding the National Policy of Resistance and Reconstruction</h3>
<p>Tomorrow (21st) is the anniversary of the recovery of Songhu by the National Revolutionary Army (yesterday's newspaper mistakenly stated that it was today). All sectors in Shanghai unanimously expressed their spiritual celebration without holding any ceremonies. Schools will also be closed as usual. All sectors will recall the glorious history of the area, firmly uphold the national policy of resisting aggression and rebuilding the country, and continue to promote economical donations and compete to purchase wartime bonds to complete the mission of national revival.</p>
<h3>Eastern Front Chinese Troops Begin Counteroffensive</h3>
<p>The Chinese troops on the Eastern Front, since Commander Shangguan led his troops eastward, planning a counteroffensive, have established close contact with all Chinese forces. Led by Commander Ruan's elite troops of the Loyal Patriotic Salvation Army, and coordinating with the New Army, totaling more than 40,000 men, equipped with the latest light and heavy weapons, and with some mechanized units and air defense equipment. Heavy artillery and warhorses are complete, heading one after another to the Zhejiang-Anhui border, arriving successively at the predetermined locations. Since advancing eastward, they have successively recovered important strongholds such as Qixing Bridge, Xiajian Temple, Pingguang, and Jinze. Now they are actively starting a counteroffensive, first completely eliminating the main mercenary force of the Ding unit, and then adopting a strategy of destroying them one by one, eliminating Zhou Damin, Ren Tianshi, and all the bandits entrenched in areas such as Wujiang, Pingwang, Kunshan, Bacheng, Qiandun, Changshu, Bailiukou, Qingpu, and Xicen. Bandit leader Zhou Damin was captured, and the captured convicts have already been sent to the rear for training and to be reformed. The Chinese side has dispersed into five routes, actively advancing towards the counties on the outskirts of Shanghai, and has completed an arc-shaped encirclement. Soon there will be large-scale mobile warfare. However, according to people from the war zone arriving in Shanghai, the discipline of the Chinese troops is strict. As they pass through various places, they cooperate with the local armed organizations, causing mercenaries in various places to automatically revolt. It is expected that there will be significant results within half a month.</p>
<h3>Gasoline Price Increase Two Jiao Per Gallon Car Companies Consider Price Increases</h3>
<p>Major foreign gasoline companies in this city announced yesterday (the 19th) a uniform increase of two jiao per gallon of gasoline. According to a certain employee of the Mobil Oil Company yesterday morning, more gasoline will arrive in Shanghai soon, so gasoline shortages are not expected. However, freight costs and the expenses in this city have recently risen sharply, making it necessary to increase gasoline prices from 3.40 yuan to 3.60 yuan per gallon. Yesterday morning, sources from various taxi companies stated that they would soon meet to discuss the gasoline price increase. Unless they conduct research and determine whether current revenue can be maintained after the gasoline price increase, taxi fares will not be increased.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Sojourners Association in Shanghai Held Executive Committee Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Zhenjiang Sojourners Association in Shanghai held a full executive committee meeting yesterday at the Jin Cheng Bank Auditorium. More than twenty people, including Wu Yunzhai, attended. The following resolutions were passed: (1) To establish a solicitation committee, invite prominent figures from Shanghai to serve as committee members, solicit new members, and start collecting membership fees from April 1st; (2) Regarding member Yang Chonggao's proposal to establish a Zhenjiang student loan fund, group weddings, and employment services, it was resolved to have Jiang Furen, Yin Shuguang, and Cheng Zuoqing, together with various standing committee members, review the original proposal and form another committee to handle the matter; (3) Regarding member Jiang Furen and others' letter requesting relief for the rice shortage in Eastern Zhenjiang, it was resolved to send separate letters to the Relief Committee, the Chinese Jisheng Society, and the Red Swastika Society to request relief, and to solicit donations from sojourners in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>United States Intensifies Aid to China Overcoming the Plague and Suppressing Totalitarianism Roosevelt's Remarks Are Nothing Short of a Guarantee</h3>
<p>U.S. aid to China is now moving towards an active implementation process. Dr. Currie, President Roosevelt's personal representative, visited China to study the economy and provide financial assistance. However, after Dr. Currie left China and arrived in Honolulu, there was some adverse propaganda against the Chinese side. However, this unintentional propaganda was refuted by President Roosevelt's statement at the White House last Saturday, declaring resolute support for China. The Mainland News' editorial yesterday also commented on President Roosevelt's guarantee of resolute aid to China.</p>
<p>Promise of Aid to China To Be Implemented Soon</p>
<p>After visiting Chongqing and other places, Dr. Currie reported his findings to President Roosevelt. President Roosevelt then gave another speech, reiterating the U.S. attitude towards China. This move effectively countered the Tokyo newspaper's reports about Dr. Currie submitting a report unfavorable to China to President Roosevelt. President Roosevelt's speech further indicated that China would be aided in the same manner as Britain. This promise is nothing short of a guarantee. President Roosevelt's great talent and eloquence are known worldwide, but he is not forgetful, forgetting today what he said yesterday. President Roosevelt always puts his words into action, with consistency between words and deeds. This can be proven by past events. Three and a half years ago, President Roosevelt gave a speech in Chicago, stating that the United States would isolate the "plague" of aggressors and strive to suppress the development of totalitarian states.</p>
<p>Belief in Victory Grows Stronger</p>
<p>At the annual banquet of the Associated Press last Saturday at the White House, President Roosevelt clearly stated that hundreds of millions of Chinese people have shown great determination to resist internal division. China, under the leadership of General Chiang Kai-shek, is requesting our assistance, and the United States has declared that China will receive our assistance. Our country should act according to the wishes of the people and do it resolutely. The arsenal of democracy, such words would be meaningless if spoken by others, but coming from the mouth of the President of the United States, they carry great weight and will be felt by the Axis powers. The President's position is supported by the entire American people, and the United States has tools that no other country possesses to realize the President's words. For three years and eight months, China has had confidence in winning this war, and this confidence has been further strengthened by President Roosevelt's recent remarks.</p>
<h3>New Pu Yu Tang Continues to Receive Donations</h3>
<p>The New Pu Yu Tang continued to receive enthusiastic donations from all walks of life yesterday. The three nuns and Mr. and Mrs. Hu Ji'an also generously donated large sums of money, showing compassion and boundless merit. The hall accommodates nearly a thousand orphaned children, and the monthly expenses are considerable. It is hoped that all sectors of society will continue to donate. The donations received yesterday are recorded as follows: three nuns, 2,000 yuan; Mr. and Mrs. Hu Ji'an, 1,000 yuan; (for the full moon of their son) Liang Huichuan, 300 yuan; Luo Yuzhang, 200 yuan; Wang Guangfang and Xu Wenfu, 150 yuan each; Heji, Xu Meiqing, Yu Pingzheng, and He Ruiguo, 100 yuan each; Jin Mingde, Zhou Yufu, and Lu Shucheng, 50 yuan each; Bi Xingbo and Zhang Xuechun, 30 yuan each; Huang Shengfu, Cheng Yangtian, Chen Rong, and Miss Zhao Wei, 10 yuan each; Zhu Fusheng, 31 chi of cowhide; Xieji, 20 yuan; Fuji, 100 yuan; Yuanji, 150 pairs of cowhide children's shoe soles; Zheng Guodian, 1 yuan; Lei Si, 2 yuan. On behalf of the orphaned children of the hall, sincere thanks are extended.</p>
<h3>Tax System Council Investigation Work Completed in Two Weeks Taxpayers Meeting to Be Held Next Month</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Gray, secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Tax System Council, speaking to reporters yesterday, the council's investigation work will be completed within two weeks. It is heard that the council will prepare a report based on the results of the investigation and submit it to the Municipal Council for discussion at the annual meeting of Western taxpayers next month. It is widely believed that at that time, the annual meeting of Western taxpayers will vote on whether to re-evaluate the value of owner-occupied land. According to Mr. Gray, although attendees at the special meeting of Western taxpayers heavily criticized the tax issue, since the establishment of the council, very few taxpayers have come forward to express their opinions, which has greatly disappointed the council. As of now, only Mr. Liddell has verbally expressed his opinions to the council. Mr. Liddell has attended the council twice, each time for two hours. In addition, the council has received several letters from Mr. Liddell and the Shanghai Tenants Association, as well as some letters forwarded by the Municipal Council. The council has paid close attention to the opinions expressed by Mr. Liddell and others. The council is working very hard. In one week, it held four meetings. The council often starts work early in the morning and does not stop until late at night.</p>
<h3>Maintaining the Shanghai Black Market Exchange Rate A Decision Not To Abandon Adequate Stabilization Fund Maintaining Is Easy</h3>
<p>The Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, having obtained a $50 million foreign exchange loan from the United States and a £5 million foreign exchange loan from the United Kingdom to maintain China's exchange rate, finds it very easy to do so. The equalization fund, calculated at the current exchange rate, amounts to 1.5 billion yuan, which is sufficient to maintain the statutory exchange rate, supply the legitimate needs of various industries as much as possible, and maintain the Shanghai black market exchange rate. Shanghai, as the economic center of China, has a neutral concession status, which is slightly different from other occupied areas. Therefore, it has been decided to continue to maintain the Shanghai black market exchange rate, while making every effort to prevent arbitrage and strictly reviewing the use of foreign exchange. There is no intention to abandon maintaining the Shanghai black market. Legitimate merchants can request foreign exchange for the import of essential goods in accordance with the law. The Chinese government can supply commercial foreign exchange that is higher than the Shanghai black market, which is clear evidence that the Chinese government is protecting the interests of legitimate merchants, so that they can be protected from the losses of the black market.</p>
<h3>More Than 10,000 Tons of Coal Dust Arrives</h3>
<p>There were reports that two coal-carrying ships had long ago set sail from the production area, but had not yet arrived, and were feared to have been lost, resulting in two more ships being unable to set sail. The price of coal and coal balls was therefore raised again, and the rush to produce them for the market resulted in crude and unusable products. It has now been proven that the above news is inaccurate. According to a certain coal merchant yesterday, the "Fushou" ship had arrived yesterday at port, berthed in the Huangpu River. The ship was carrying 5,500 tons of Gubart coal dust. Also, the "Mingyang" ship had arrived yesterday afternoon, carrying 6,500 tons of Keelung coal dust.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Tung Seedling Exports</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance telegraphed all customs offices to open, permitting the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to consult, stating that Brazil is currently promoting the planting of tung trees, which will inevitably affect the promotion of our country's tung oil in overseas markets. It is proposed to request that all customs offices be instructed to strictly prohibit the export of tung oil seeds and tung oil branches from this country, in order to benefit the foreign sales of tung oil and prevent market competition. After investigation, tung oil seeds have already been prohibited from export together with tung fruit and tung kernels, and a general order has been issued for compliance. In order to prevent tung seedlings from being transplanted overseas, all tung oil branches should be strictly prohibited from export. It is ordered that this be complied with.</p>
<h3>Power Company Adopts Absolutely Fair Method for Reducing Electricity Most Users Unaffected</h3>
<p>The "Times" reports that Mr. Feller, Vice President of the Shanghai Power Company, explained yesterday the temporary measures implemented by the company to reduce electricity before the Electricity Distribution Committee of the Municipal Council completed its research. It is said that this method is absolutely fair, and all users will be involved in rotation, and the same fair method will be adopted when it is cancelled in the future. The personnel sent out by the company to record the electricity meters go to the users' premises according to the calendar to record the meters. Once all the recording is completed, the users will be formally notified of the electricity to be reduced. There are currently more than 100,000 electricity meters in the Public Concession. Due to accounting issues and manpower shortages, it is impossible to complete the recording immediately. At the current rate, 4,000 households can be recorded every day. Fortunately, most users use less than 1,000 kilowatt-hours per month, so they will not be affected.</p>

<h3>Two People Jointly Establish Hardware Store Dispute Over Accounts Wu Xinhai Accused of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Wu Xinhai, from Ningbo, residing at No. 9, Lane 195, McGonigal Road, previously partnered with Xu Yecheng at Wan Tai Hardware Store, No. 540 Ningbo Road. Later, due to the development of the business, a branch was established in Chongqing. At that time, Wu and Xu went to Chongqing together to manage everything. Later, Wu Xinhai returned to Shanghai to handle the Shanghai store's affairs. Recently, Xu suddenly claimed that Wu had embezzled a loan of 17,500 yuan, and telegraphed his wife, Xu Xiaomeizi, to hire lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to report to the Xin Zha Police Station, which dispatched detective Ma Zhongrong to arrest Wu and bring him to the First Special Court for interrogation. He was released on bail pending trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu ascended the bench to continue the interrogation. The defendant hired lawyers Chen Xingmin and Zheng Wenkai to appear in court and stated that the defendant, Wu Xinhai, had previously been involved in a civil lawsuit with Xu Yecheng over the settlement of accounts in the Civil Court. Because Xu was far away in Chongqing and the account books had not been handed over, Judge Tao advised him to withdraw the lawsuit temporarily. Now, the defendant has 24 boxes of hardware, worth more than 20,000 yuan, which he was planning to ship, but this case suddenly occurred, so he stopped the shipment. It is not embezzlement. The court ordered the case to be postponed for seven days, instructing both parties to try to reach a settlement outside the court before further consideration.</p>
<h3>Suicide Due to Business Losses</h3>
<p>A lodger surnamed Chen, a local resident, 44 years old, suddenly committed suicide by drinking a bottle of liquid in Room 20 of the Zhongshan Hotel at No. 480 Tianjin Road the night before last. It was not until around 3:00 AM yesterday morning that a tea boy discovered him, already dead. It was found that Chen was an employee of the Heji Coal Company on Peng Road. Because he had used up the guest account and could not make up for it, he resorted to this desperate measure.</p>
<h3>Fire on Rue Chapsal</h3>
<p>Jiang Lian'gen, from Jiangbei, residing at No. 4, Lane 300, Rue Chapsal, French Concession, made a living by renting out rickshaws. At 6:48 AM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in Jiang's house. Immediately, flames spread everywhere, reaching the roof. After the fire brigade learned of the fire, it rushed to the scene and extinguished it after an hour. In addition to the complete destruction of the house at No. 4, the two neighboring houses at No. 3 and No. 5 were also destroyed. When the fire was raging, Jiang woke up and quickly saved his only three-month-old daughter, resulting in both father and daughter being burned by the fire. Afterwards, an ambulance was called to send them to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Lost Children Awaiting Collection</h3>
<p>The French police found three lost children in the concession on the 7th of this month. They are currently being temporarily cared for by the police station. It is hoped that their families will come to claim them as soon as possible. The names of the three children are listed below: (1) Zhu Zhenbao (9 years old, from Changshu, female); (2) Tu Xiudi (13 years old, from Fenghua, female); (3) Zhang Ahuan (10 years old, from Shaoxing, male).</p>
<h3>Ding Yanyong, Ni Yide, and Others to Hold Exhibition</h3>
<p>Modern first-class painters Ding Yanyong, Ni Yide, female painter Guan Zilan, and young writers Zhao Wuji, Huang Duwei, and Shen Yingyin will hold a modern painting exhibition at the Daxin Gallery for one week in the near future. The exhibits all have modern tendencies and fully express the national spirit, which will be a brilliant addition to the art world of the isolated island. It is heard that preparations are currently underway.</p>
<h3>Tao Tao Sock Factory Opens Today</h3>
<p>The Tao Tao Sock Factory at No. 181 Avenue Joffre, French Concession, was established by a giant of the department store industry. The scope is very wide, divided into departments for socks, cosmetics, toys, cotton textiles, rubber, and steel. It is heard that the factory will officially open today.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Having recently read an article in your newspaper on March 19 regarding the Yuan Chang Yarn Company fraud case, it involved our bank, stating that "the Fu Kang Bank had 8,660 yuan that had not been withdrawn, and immediately notified them to suspend payment. The bank agreed. However, when the court's order to stop payment arrived in the afternoon, the money had already been withdrawn." Upon investigation, the money was our bank's cashier's check, which was cleared on February 25. The court order was relayed through our association on the 26th, and the money could no longer be stopped. Our bank reported the situation to the association, which was forwarded to the court. All the sections published in your newspaper clearly differ from the facts and are believed to be based on inaccurate rumors. We hope you will correct this.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Fu Kang Bank, March 19, 1941</p>

<h3>The Heart of Separation</h3>
<p>— Mo Zi</p>
<p>Tonight, I finished teaching him English, and he thanked me as he said goodbye. Only then did I remember that today was the "last lesson" of his learning stage. Tomorrow he will leave here and change to another job. Because of the distance, he has been reading English for several months, but now he has to interrupt it.</p>
<p>I sent him downstairs and asked him for the address of his new home, saying that I would visit him when I had time. He thanked me humbly, all the way to the door, letting the sound stay in the dark alley. My heart felt empty, as if I couldn't bear this simple separation, and I deeply remembered the past.</p>
<p>Half a year ago, Pei came every night to read English for an hour, and had continued reading for three months without interruption. Her progress was rapid. When she was about to finish reading the second book, she said to me:</p>
<p>"Soon I will leave here and go to a very far place to live a happy life." I knew she was a lively and enthusiastic child, and she often told me that she couldn't stand the silence here and wanted to live a meaningful life. I first expressed my approval of her actions, and then said to her:</p>
<p>"When you leave, you won't have nightly homework anymore. I feel very lonely."</p>
<p>"No, I'll introduce you to..." A happy smile appeared on her innocent face. I suspected she was joking with me, so I said:</p>
<p>"Don't joke, if you suddenly stop doing something you're used to doing every day, don't you feel lonely?"</p>
<p>"Who's joking with you, it's true. I'll introduce you to an apprentice, he wants to read English. When I leave, you can ask him to come and read every day, and you won't feel lonely." Her words were both serious and light.</p>
<p>So she told me again that she often bought things in that shop, and gradually became acquainted with that apprentice. Recently, he asked her if there was any place where he could get English tutoring, so she took this opportunity to introduce him to me.</p>
<p>The next day, she brought the apprentice, sixteen or seventeen years old, short in stature, with a dark face. He had attended elementary school, and had come to Shanghai as an apprentice three years ago. He was worried about burying his future while being immersed in oil, soy sauce, wine, and vinegar all day long, so he was looking for another job and wanted to read a little English.</p>
<p>Pei left, and I sent her to the door, blessing her bright future. A heart of separation pressed heavily on me, but I didn't feel empty, I could still get fulfillment in the nightly homework.</p>
<p>He also came to read for an hour every night, and I taught him with the same enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Several times a day I had to pass by that shop. If it was a slack time in the business, I always saw him holding a book and reading. Although there wasn't a continuous stretch of time for him to read, his recitation, new words, and explanations were all done very well. Under the heavy pressure of life, his desire for knowledge was particularly strong, so his progress was particularly fast, and his ability to accept was far beyond that of a junior high school student.</p>
<p>Three months passed, and the first book was about to be finished. Pei also asked about him in her letters, and said that she was living very well there. I told him that Pei had asked about his studies. He was very moved when he heard this and said:</p>
<p>"Please thank her for her kindness. Soon I will go to work in a factory, the location is very far from here, and I'm afraid I won't be able to continue reading English. Please tell her that too." I felt very surprised, but I still calmly taught him the last few days, and he listened with extra care.</p>
<p>Tonight, he thanked me sincerely, and I was ashamed that I hadn't helped him get much in the past three months. I asked him about the factory, and he happily said that life was more regulated than in the store, and he could study on his own at night. I was delighted that he could use his hands to push the wheel of life from now on, and also push the wheel of the world.</p>
<p>The feeling of separation tonight made me feel the sorrow of loneliness, and I nervously recalled the past six months. I hope that their future and life will be meaningful, and that my empty heart left here can still be fulfilled.</p>
<h3>One Day</h3>
<p>— Yu Yunzuo</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(5) The Division Between Love and Desire</p>
<p>He supported his chin with his right hand, staring blankly at the two swords hanging on the wall; the heavy snoring coming from the next room told him that Zhao Si and the actor Li Yuzhen had gone into the black and sweet countryside without any worries. The running around and disputes of the past few days, although they had made him feel equally tired, sleep was absolutely impossible until he had finished writing this letter.</p>
<p>"Having had the honor of meeting you these days, it has been the greatest joy of my life; and your fairy-like appearance, jade-like bones, and wise heart are especially what I infinitely admire..."</p>
<p>The third sheet of paper seemed to be going smoothly, but after rereading the first paragraph, he felt that it was absolutely unusable; such nauseating sentences were what those adoring actors were used to, and what he hated the most. After all, he was still a man, still an actor, and even he couldn't help but get goosebumps when he saw it. How could he offend a dignified and noble woman like Luo Xiangqi?</p>
<p>As soon as Qiu Haitang thought about this, the third sheet of paper was crumpled into a ball again and sent into the wastepaper basket.</p>
<p>Seeing that a very thick pad of stationery was almost half torn away, his tired brain finally showed him a miracle, allowing him to write the following short note in a matter of three or four minutes: — the plan for a long letter was ultimately abandoned.</p>
<p>"I am deeply grateful for your help in this matter, for which I have no way to express my gratitude. All disputes are expected to be resolved within days, but before returning to Beijing, I have something I wish to tell you and would like to meet for a talk (at your residence or elsewhere). Please do not refuse, and I pray that you will reply at your earliest convenience! Yours sincerely, Wu Jun"</p>
<p>In this way, he felt very satisfied. Although he really had no experience in pursuing women, he also knew from common sense that it would be cleaner and more straightforward to attack directly from the front rather than circling around. He thought that if the other party really had no interest, he would know if she just didn't reply.</p>
<p>"Perhaps she doesn't know who Wu Jun is?" After sealing the envelope, he hesitated again, because Wu Jun was the name he had given himself, and few outsiders knew it, but Qiu Haitang really didn't want to use his stage name or the three characters Wu Yuqin to communicate with Luo Xiangqi, so he still used it; according to his speculation, with so many handkerchiefs and a bottle of perfume being sent at the same time, plus Luo Xiangqi's intelligence, she should be able to guess who "Wu Jun" was.

<p>War</p>
<h3>Mosquito Warships</h3>
<p>— Jin Chun</p>
<p>The United States Navy recently manufactured a batch of Mosquito warships. These are small, exquisite armored warships, 70 feet long. Because they have an extremely shallow draft, they can freely pass through torpedo blockades, and even if they launch torpedoes, there is nothing to be done about them. Their equipment is also extremely complete, equipped with four torpedo launch tubes, two anti-aircraft guns, six underwater bomb launchers, and smoke screen equipment.</p>
<p>Mosquito warships have extremely high speeds and long sailing distances, with a speed of 50 miles per hour, and a maximum sailing distance of over 2,000 miles. They are very flexible to operate, and can be maneuvered as needed. Among all ships, only Mosquito warships can perform the kind of sideslip sailing that airplanes do. In addition, because the ship is small, it is very difficult for airplanes to bomb or strafe them with machine guns.</p>
<p>Mosquito warships have more combat power than torpedo destroyers, but cost far less than torpedo destroyers. Even if there are losses, the number of crew members is less than one-tenth of the number of people driving a torpedo destroyer. With smoke screen cover, they are unlikely to hit mines. If a submarine surfaces, it will be sunk by warships. Mosquito warships are light and flexible, and when maneuvered properly, they can defeat large warships.</p>
<p>The United States Navy is now working hard to improve and manufacture these Mosquito warships, and even touts them as era-defining new weapons.</p>

<h3>Not Defaulting on Debts</h3>
<p>— Fang Shaohui</p>
<p>According to the American Bank Monthly Report, a recent, interesting, and valuable statistic was obtained from a well-known university regarding "bad debts" among Americans. This statistic is categorized by the nature of individuals' occupations. According to the "law of large numbers" in statistics, we can discern the general level of responsibility and morality within various occupational fields, serving as a reference for extending credit.</p>
<p>The following percentages represent the number of people per hundred who do not default on their debts:</p>
<p>Office Clerks……92%</p>
<p>Retailers……89%</p>
<p>Teachers……86%</p>
<p>Doctors……80%</p>
<p>Male Workers……71%</p>
<p>Lawyers and Female Workers……61%</p>
<p>Firefighters……58%</p>
<p>University Students……56%</p>
<p>Furthermore, the percentages for occupations such as nurses, servants, and waiters are even lower. (Transferred from Educational Loan)</p>

<p>It is said that the China Traveling Theater Company is regrouping and will perform "Hong Xuanjiao" at the Lyceum Theatre starting on the 14th of next month. Yesterday, they hosted reporters from various newspapers at the Guangming Cafe.</p>
<p>The "China Travel" company has been around for eight or nine years. In terms of achievements, it can be considered significant. The rise and consolidation of the spoken drama movement in Shanghai was largely due to the long-term performances of "China Travel" when they first came to Shanghai. At that time, "China Travel" was truly powerful. "Thunderstorm," which is now a "seasonal play," shook Shanghai because of "China Travel's" performance. However, good times don't last. Later, "China Travel" seemed to be gradually aging, personnel disputes became increasingly complex, and the spirit of work was not as good as before. Eventually, a collective action occurred in Hong Kong where more than ten members left the group. After much difficulty, they arrived in Shanghai and found a foothold at the Xuan Palace. They struggled to perform for fourteen months, but at the end of February, the Tianfeng Company suddenly took over the Xuan Palace. Thus, this first professional spoken drama troupe in China, with a considerable history, had to say goodbye to the Xuan Palace in tears and find their own way out.</p>
<p>We don't have to shy away from the fact that there were some points of conflict between Tang Huaiqiu and his daughter Tang Ruoqing. The conflict between Tang Ruoqing and Tang Huaiqiu, the "soul" of the family, backstage during the revival of "Hua Mulan" was a concrete manifestation of this. After "China Travel" stopped performing, rumors spread that Tang Huaiqiu would retire and that Tang Ruoqing would be in charge of "China Travel." However, father and daughter are, after all, blood relatives. When external crises outweighed internal conflicts, the united front of the father and daughter was easily formed. Thus, they went around, with Tang Huaiqiu contacting theaters and Tang Ruoqing appealing to Wei Ruhui and Fei Mu to serve as playwrights and directors. The precarious fate of "China Travel" was revived.</p>
<p>Yesterday's banquet for reporters at the Guangming Cafe was "China Travel's" formal expression of regrouping to the outside world. At the same time, to prove the accuracy of their "official report," they also invited Wei Ruhui and Fei Mu to attend.</p>
<p>Moving or Fleeing?</p>
<p>After everyone was seated, the four hosts deferred to each other, and finally, "Director" Tang was nominated to "perform." Tang Huaiqiu's words were very simple. He said, "Just now, an old friend came in and asked me: 'Is China Travel moving?' Speaking of moving, I think it would be more accurate to say fleeing. When Jin Shan and Wang Ying were on a mobile tour, wherever they went, they changed the name of the play "Put Down Your Whip" to "Fleeing to ××." This time, we are really fleeing. The reason for inviting everyone here for a meal today is very simple, which is that "China Travel" is going to perform again. Please help us a lot."</p>
<p>After his "performance" was over, Tang Ruoqing said, "Dad, you didn't memorize your 'lines' well."</p>
<p>Tang Huaiqiu said, "I'm acting in a prompt book play, there are no 'lines' at all." After thinking for a while, he stood up again to supplement his "performance":</p>
<p>"This time we are performing "Hong Xuanjiao," which is written by Mr. Wei Ruhui and directed by Mr. Fei Mu. Both of these gentlemen are here today."</p>
<p>"Dad's" Daughter, Tang Ruoqing</p>
<h3>Theatrical News</h3>
<p>— Jue Xin</p>
<p>Xun Huisheng has arrived in Shanghai and will take the stage at the Golden Grand Theatre starting tomorrow evening (the 21st). According to Sun Lanting, the manager of the theater, the audience has already booked eight hundred seats, which is very reassuring. Huisheng has been away from Shanghai for eight years, and the sensation is naturally expected. As for his opening play, it is still "Hongluanxi." Since he became famous, every time he came to Shanghai to perform, he used this play as his opening play. I remember the last time he came to Shanghai eight years ago, he took the stage at the Tianchan Stage on the first day of the lunar new year.</p>
<p>After Huisheng finishes performing for twenty-four days at the Golden Theatre, he will then perform at the Xinxin Stage. This satisfies both parties who competed for his performance. The Xinxin authorities had several negotiations with Zhang Yipeng regarding Huisheng's performance, asking him to rest temporarily and wait for Huisheng to finish performing before taking the stage. Yipeng was originally unwilling to accept this request, but due to the relationship, after several compromises, he agreed.</p>
<p>During the break period, Yipeng actively rehearsed the second volume of "Journey to the West" and took this opportunity to clean up the backstage, removing the dross and preserving the essence, so that the second volume of "Journey to the West" could be staged with a perfect cast. As for the script of the second volume, it is being revised by Wei Ruhui, but it has not yet been finalized.</p>
<p>The Xinxin Stage gave Yipeng a fixed fee of three thousand yuan during the break period, but he also received a share of the profits earned during Huisheng's performance. This is probably a new record for a "fixed fee."</p>
<p>Someone suggested inviting the playwright and director to "perform," but they all politely declined.</p>
<h3>The Cast of "Hong Xuanjiao"</h3>
<p>In Tang Huaiqiu's report, it was only known that the performance period of "Hong Xuanjiao" would start on the 14th of next month. The number of days of performance and the cast of actors were not mentioned.</p>
<p>According to what I have learned, it is like this: The performance period of "Hong Xuanjiao" is scheduled for nine days. The cast of actors is roughly decided as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Xuanjiao (Tang Ruoqing) Hong Xiuquan (Tang Huaiqiu) Shi Dakai (Shao Hua) Li Xiucheng (Zhao Shu) Yang Xiuqing (Qiu Quan) Wei Changhui (Liao Fan) Xiao Sanniang (Wang Wei) Hong Fu (Ge Xin) In this cast, Gong Jiabao has no role, Huang He has joined the United Troupe, and Shi Hui has been admitted to the Shanghai Drama Society, and Sun Jinglu's whereabouts are unknown, so she also has no role.</p>
<h3>Hopes for "China Travel"</h3>
<p>This theater incident was a blow and also a stimulus to China Travel. However, adversity builds a nation, as the saying goes. From now on, since the Tang family father and daughter have formed a united front, they should work hard and it should not be difficult to restore their past glory. However, everything depends on human effort. It is also hoped that they will take more care, especially in terms of the repertoire. Do not repeatedly "rehash old rice" by always performing the same old plays such as "Thunderstorm," "Sunrise," "The Wilderness," and "New Mello Fragrance," because audiences are always seeing these same plays. From the perspective of "China Travel" itself, this is also a mistake in business.</p>
<p>"China Travel" has a long history of eight or nine years, has experienced hardship, and has finally persevered. This time is another last stand. Although they are all veteran generals who have been through many battles, they must not be careless. We sincerely hope that "China Travel" can strive for progress and restore its past glory. An army grieving for its losses will surely be victorious. We also pray that this "Hong Xuanjiao" can achieve a triumphant start.</p>

<h3>Brief Report on "Boom Town"</h3>
<p>"Boom Town" is a blockbuster produced by MGM with all its efforts. There are as many as five major stars starring in it. In addition to Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, Claudette Colbert, and Hedy Lamarr, there is also the film veteran Frank Morgan. Its lineup can be said to be quite strong.</p>
<p>This film was shot for ten weeks, costing one million US dollars, with twenty-seven exterior scenes and five intense battle scenes. The story tells the story of the American oil field exploitation, weaving in the love of men and women and the loyalty of friends. The plot is tortuous and stimulating.</p>
<p>In order to make the oil well's blowout look realistic, a special oil pool was dug, with a volume of 300,000 gallons of kerosene. Huge water pumps were installed. Initially, it was planned to use oozing syrup instead of kerosene, but the local residents strongly opposed it because the sweet water would breed mosquitoes. The company had to use real kerosene to shoot the film.</p>
<p>This film will be screened at the Grand China Theatre starting this Saturday. The seat prices have been slightly increased. It can be said to be another blockbuster after "Gone with the Wind."</p>
<h3>Chapter 3: Makes One Remember Lord Pingyuan</h3>
<p>Zhang Cangqiu, burning with anger, chased him here, fearing nothing and only seeking a fight. Now, seeing that this young man named Li spoke very reasonably and had no arrogance, he had to put down his treasured sword and replied, "My surname is Zhang, my name is Cangqiu. I came from Jigong Mountain. Just now, I stayed overnight at the home of a newly acquainted friend, Xu Jing. Both the treasured sword and the treasured horse are my beloved possessions. That Xu, also has a treasured sword. We exchanged it to look at it, but unexpectedly, someone was secretly watching and wanted to take the opportunity to steal it. Think about it, such precious things, how can they be easily stolen by others? I and Xu Jing chased after him together, but unexpectedly, this man named Chen used a hidden weapon to knock Xu Jing down. Because I could not bear to abandon the enemy, I chased him all the way here." After Li Xin heard Zhang Cangqiu's words, he asked, "Brave Zhang, is the Xu Jing you are talking about a young scholar?" Zhang Cangqiu nodded and said, "Exactly. He was injured, and I haven't gone to see him yet." Li Xin hurriedly said, "That's bad, that Xu Qing is also my friend. I don't know if his injury is serious? Let's go see him quickly." Zhang Cangqiu said, "That's right." Then he followed Li Xin, opened the garden gate, and walked out of the village. Chen Fei and the family members also lit lanterns and torches and walked towards the road they came from. After walking a short distance, they saw a dark figure sitting by the roadside. Everyone ran over and looked at it by the light of the lanterns. It was Xu Jing. Xu Jing was very surprised when he saw Zhang Cangqiu and Li Xin coming, and the horse thief was also among them. Zhang Cangqiu and Li Xin both stepped forward and asked him where he was injured and how he was feeling now. Xu Jing replied, "My injury is still light. Fortunately, the arrowhead did not go deep and I pulled it out. I tore a small piece of cloth from my lapel and tied it myself, so it stopped bleeding. However, I almost fainted when I fell just now. By the time I got up, Brave Zhang was gone, so I'm still sitting here resting, not going back. How did you run here with Brother Li?" Li Xin laughed and said, "This is called no acquaintance without a fight." Then he briefly told him about Zhang Cangqiu chasing Chen Fei to his village. Xu Jing also said, "How coincidental, how coincidental." Because Chen Fei had injured Xu Jing with a hidden weapon, although people did not blame him, he felt a little sorry in his heart, so he came over to apologize to Xu Jing. (16)</p>
<h3>The Philosophy of a Striving Life</h3>
<p>The fruit of striving is not the final step of striving, but the foundation of the second stage, that is, the cause of the second stage of striving. Cause becomes fruit, and fruit becomes cause. Cause and effect are interconnected, and in fact, it is impossible to distinguish which one is the cause and which one is the fruit, and striving becomes an endless process of progress. (Zong Yu)</p>
