<p>社評</p>
<h3>歐戰新節段與列强</h3>
<p>希臘戰事的結束並未替世界帶來片刻的寗靜，北非的爭奪戰方在埃及西境慘烈的進行，新的戰事又在美索不達米亞遺址的平原上展開，這幾個人類古代文化的最重要策源地，現在幾乎同時蒙受着現代砲火的洗禮，這是歷史的悲劇，但却又是冷酷的諷刺。</p>
<p>無論英方保衛埃及的任務能夠順利遂行與否，北非的戰事大概已無迅作結束的可能，而戰事之火却又被引導到亞洲。歐戰這一繼續擴大的趨勢，固然表示着軸心對於攻略英國心臟的任務，一時尚無必勝把握，以是乃不能不依舊割裂英國肢體方面覓求出路。此其在戰略方面之為得為失，于此姑不具論，但無疑將使更多的無辜人民無端遭受侵略戰爭慘禍，另外更使若干第三國家欲求中立自保而不可得，戰爭的重心雖然仍在歐洲，而歐戰之將擴展而為此世界大戰，殆已成無不挽回的命運。</p>
<p>諦視至今尚在歐戰圈外的並世各國，其對於國際大局具有舉足重輕作用的是美蘇日本，次要的是土耳其法國與西班牙，凡此各國之間，其對於交戰國雙方關係的離合向背雖云大體已定，却亦不無繼續發生變化的可能。而且嚴格說來，其中只有美國一國，立塲早已確定，並將隨未來局勢的演變而更形積極，此外各國，或則對英有條約義務，或則對德有傳統感情，或則勉力維持中立，或則靜觀未來事變之推移，其態度都不能視為絕對一成不變，且對於歐戰前途具有相當決定作用。最近，對於法西和土耳其，德方正分別進行外交方面的攻勢，就目前情形看，西班牙雖然親近軸心，但為內部困難所迫，一時未必立即改變態度；法國縱有拉伐爾達爾蘭流輩之主張進一步與納粹合流，而反對勢力較之也有過之無不及，德方攫取法國艦隊與地中海海軍根據地的願望也非旦夕所能滿足。只有土耳其，處境最困難，態度最微妙，已往之在保加利亞與德義締盟前夜與之簽訂不侵公約，無形替侵希德軍闢一假道坦途，用意已覺費解，最近復在巴爾幹戰爭進行正烈之際一再與軸心國家簽訂經濟恊定，更令人莫名對外政策的基準安在。固然，始終保持中立的蘇聯也曾在不久以前與德簽訂經濟條約，但對英負有條約義務的土耳其却非蘇聯可比。而且目前軸心方面已在土國背腹雙方採取行動，逼迫土當局表示最後態度，土方之如何應付，正是此際全世界所密切注視着的問題。不過，法西以及土國，其對於歐戰所能影響的範圍，至多隻以地中海以至近東問題為限，換句話說，也就是只能對於務方肢解英國的戰略發生作用，至於英德間的主國爭鬥，那除却雙方自身實力而外，却要看美蘇以至日本的動向。</p>
<p>目前國際間的分野，較之去秋三國盟約甫訂之際。似已有新的變化：前此美日分別是英德雙方的與國，蘇聯貌雖中立實則較袒德方比較是納粹方面較佔優勢。現在美之助英已鄰近參戰的邊沿，日之援德，却不像想像那樣積極。松崗赴歐之行，對於德義關係無所裨益，而與蘇訂約一舉顯見其把對蘇關係看得比德義盟誼更重，近衛松崗之一再聲言三國公約無可再行增强，可說明其最近心理之一般。日來松崗遊美之說甚囂塵上，日方報章論文又屢以美日間並無不可解決懸案為言，這自然不是日本竟有傾向民冶國的可能，但却未嘗不是不願為德扮演牽制美國任務的暗示，此其用意，無論是要和英美爭斤論兩，以取得交換條件，抑或幻想「中國事變」的解決，都只是為自身打算，而不是履行盟約義務。至於蘇聯，表面上固冷靜如常，但並不能盡掩其內心的焦躁，對日訂約而後，更以禁止軍火過境隔絕德日關係，都是一種對德警戒的表現。其對於英美固無好感，且至今仍不斷在文吿上攻擊英美，然而蘇當局所謂準備擊退帝國主義侵犯者，總不是對於英美之無的放矢吧？固然，英美至今尚不乏一貫反蘇的頑强人物，若以此際英美實際處境及對外政策而言，則不惟沒有進攻蘇聯可能，抑且無此存心。縱然蘇方一時還要掩飾其對德戒備並避免發生實際衝突，以免歐戰之轉化為蘇當局所最感恐怖的「反蘇大戰」，是以一聞國際間對於蘇德關係惡化有所揣測即色然而怒，國加辯白，而事實上所表現以至德方最近所採戰略，却都昭示着雙方矛盾只有日益加深，伊拉克的戰事尚未聞蘇方作何反應，但即使希特勒真以瓜分近東為餌，蘇當局也未必貪此小利而竟甘放任納粹勢力的繼續膨脹吧？</p>
<p>於此可見儘管在地中海和近東方面，軸心還有獲得進展的可能，在整個世界範圍的當中，其所能憑藉的力量已顯見縮小。但在民治國家，對於此種國際外交上的種種離合，實不必過加重視，更不必用何等代價去爭取，真正能夠左右這些因素者，並不在於縱橫椑闔的運用，而實在於雙方自身實力的强弱與爭戰的進退。</p>

<p>柏林　希特勒元首今日下午六時在克洛爾音樂院德國國會中發表演說、指陳當歐戰爆發之初、渠曾在國會向各議員發表報吿、繼稱、「余屢次企圖與各國、尤其英國成立諒解、以期獲得永久友善之合作、此項努力均因一部份少數份子之阻力歸於失敗、此輩份子堅決認爲戰事無可避免、或由於嫉恨之心理、或由於物質上之觀點、當時此輩少數份子之領袖即今日英國首相邱吉爾、其餘信徒即今日英國組成內閣之閣員、</p>

<h3>英艦攔截敵船　使用國際信號</h3>
<p>倫敦　英海軍昨囑英國各處無綫　臺向世界各處播送英國對敵艦之警吿、略謂英艦今後將對敵艦發WBA國際信號、其義即「停駛·勿放下救生艇·勿自鑿沉·勿用無錢電·違者砲轟」是、（四日路透電）</p>
<h3>美大西洋巡邏隊　奉命不得開火　祗應將德船活動情形　用廣播傳達英國海軍</h3>
<p>華盛頓　昨日此間消息靈通界稱、美國之大西洋巡邏隊已奉命「不被擊沉時、極力避免開火」、此項巡邏隊聞係在英國西岸海港以外之一千五百哩以內進行、並奉命偵察軸心國之海面船隻潛艇及飛機、而向英方電播其蹤跡、維持接觸、至英軍開到時爲止、（四日合衆電）</p>
<p>海軍部否認　以軍艦護航</p>
<p>華盛　美國海軍部昨日發表正式文吿、否認美國軍艦正作護航之用、當詢及外傳美國軍艦多艘、載有大批軍用品、巳駛人蘇彝士運河交予英國時、　部發表如下文告、「美艦未有被派護航者」、同時美國商航部亦未聞　訊、惟稱、該部對每一船隻之動態、並無詳細之情報（四日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　此間航業界、認美船已載戰具行抵蘇彝士河之說、殆屬確實、蓋聞四月、初在羅斯福總統宣布紅　不爲戰區時、曾有貨船滿載接濟希南兩國之戰具、由美駛出也、官塲聲明、希南兩國雖已失敗、但戰具依然運歐、（四日路透電）</p>

<p>紐約據哥倫比亞廣播公司今日所接之英方無綫電消息、載有援英軍需之美商船二十六艘、巳駛抵蘇彝士運河、按此次船隻之駛抵蘇彝士運河、係根據羅斯福總統已定之政策、因總統曾稱、美船今後可駛進先前所禁止、開入之戰區、（四日國際電）</p>
<h3>日外交政策　將有變動　日所最注意者　厥為美國態度</h3>
<p>東京　日新聞昨日預言、日外相松岡於星期一晚自大廟謁神歸來後、日本之外交政策將更爲積極云、松岡係昨晚赴大廟向太陽神報吿遊歐之經過、據料日本所商訂之泰越和平條約、將於本星期內正式簽字、而該兩簽約國並將正式保證、不締結有不利於日本之協定、此項保證將確保日本在東亞之優越地位云、朝日新聞又謂、日蘇中立公條乃日蘇締結基本漁業條約之先聲、並有助於日本在東亞之地位、因此日本僅存之問題係與美國有關、美國對於日本之南進政策、曾表極嚴重之關切、日本必須探悉美國之態度、日本關於此方面如何進行、當然須視國際局勢將來之發展云、（四日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>德機數百架　襲利物浦　投高度爆裂彈　造成重大損害</h3>

<h3>歐戰叢談（五）（十）　美外交官的新典型</h3>
<p>當他的午奶塲經理報吿康谷特一家醫院積欠牛奶販一一五百　時，他就照單代爲價淸。一個寒冷的早晨，他知道警察署中有許多流丏放出，都沒有早飯吃，又知道當地並無公款可以供給這一　早餐，他使自掏腰包去買辦一切，他幾年來仍繼續着這樣的善舉。</p>
<p>他在紐約，有一次曾費了整天的工夫，去替一個女孩子尋覓工作。這女孩子和他並不相識，祇因她在康谷特的親友　爲呼籲，韋南特便不惜跋涉奔波，竭力安挿。他在　盛頓時，有一天下午出外參加友人的婚體。不料所坐汽車，繞了遠路，到得禮拜堂門口時，一對新夫婦已經禮畢出來了。韋用特恐他們知道他錯過婚禮，因而不安，重又縮回　中。</p>
<p>他現在出任駐英大使，將爲美總統和國務部的報吿員。若在平時，他將出席許多盛會，發表許多演說，到處受人歡迎，一方面因為他是大國的代表，一方面也因他確有名人的資望。但在戰時，他的工作要重大得多，而且在性質上也大不相同，宴會稀少，在燈火管制和計口授糧制下的英國，從前的奢靡，已不適宜於今日。他的交際將减到最少限度，這對於不注意社交生活的韋南特，倒是十分適合。</p>
<p>他在格志斯文納的大使館內，正像軍事觀察家在前綫的崗位上一般。他和所有的倫敦人相同，一樣受空襲的威脅。他是一切消息的來源，凡關於空防的進步，社會情形的緊張，和英國人民，特別是英國勞工在這空前試騐之下的轉變，都要報吿美國政府。</p>
<p>他在日內瓦時，曾竭力保持歐洲和平，並在擾攘不寗的世界中，力謀保全國際勞工局自由調查和民治思想的精神。當德國進佔蘇台德　之時，他又飛往捷京普拉格，表示具有民主思想的人民的同情。德國炸彈第一次落在巴黎近郊之時，他又在幕後活動，促進達拉第總理和工界妥協。</p>
<p>他看見憔悴　惶的難民，也看見過士氣渙散的敗軍。他對於這些戰爭的犧牲，因此愈增熱烈。在瑞士將與外界隔絕的時候，他想把國際勞工局遷往美國而未果，只好遷到加拿大的蒙特里爾。</p>
<p>現在的倫敦，現在的英國，已與前任諸大使所知的逈異。這位新大使對於英國的勞工部，衛生部，以及担任疏散人口，分配食糧，和各種社會公益事業的一切公私機關，應較其他大使更加注意。韋南特担負着許多更重要的職務，不僅決定覲見時應穿何種服裝而已。</p>
<p>一部份美國人，恐怕英國變遷過甚，或者巳被迫社會主義化，因而感到惶慮。他們建議美國非先確知英國　來的演進，不可遽與英國共安危，羅斯福總統的遣派韋南特，並非要指示英國以　行的方向，但對於英國社會所發生的重大改革，顯然要隨時獲得消息。</p>
<p>等到戰爭結束，而考慮世界的將來之時，這種情形對於美國或者非常重要；在這個世界中，美國的作用，似將還過於往日，她的選任這樣一個新人物做駐英大使，其原因就在此吧！</p>

<h3>港米門售並無限制　准許自由購買　如轉售漁利當盡法究懲　米號亦不得攙雜或尅扣</h3>
<p>自公共租界當局曁法租界當局為澈底安定本市民食、決定直接向洋米產區訂購、運滬平賣、消息　播後、一般米　雖欲維持高價、以遂其私慾、但已為實胃呆滯所打破、兼之米市塲管理委員會、自採取杜絕投機各項措置後、亦已見效、昨據某管理委員稱、管委會目前</p>
<p>防杜投機</p>
<p>之處置決將繼續施行、同業　再違反是項措置者決予以事業嚴厲制裁云、又據熟悉米市之某君稱、戰前米價每石如上漲一角餘時、即認為已屬非常、而目前米價每次上漲、恒達五六元之鉅、且價格一日數變、其上落之情狀、較交易所投機行為尤甚、同業中獲利者固有、但最能獲得鉅利者、係屬擁有大量游資而囤有鉅額數量者、估計本市各堆棧一百數十萬包之囤米、其中至少有九十餘萬包操縱在數大囤戶手中、每石米價最多不過九十元左右、此次藉口南洋局勢緊張、每石被狂抬至一百五十六元、數大囤戶或以為所囤之九十餘萬包米糧、轉瞬間即可獲利達五六千萬元之鉅、不意兩租界當局鑒於民食問題、日趨嚴重、遂採取目下之措置、予米　以嚴重打擊、故本市此後民食、當可</p>
<p>澈底穩定</p>
<p>而一般平民亦可獲得合理售價之食米、又據記者探悉、自公共租界於昨日公布規定廉價港米售與行家每包為一百二十二元九角一分、而行家售與米號家為一百三十元五角、每包所獲利潤十餘元之鉅、故各米行家亦已紛紛贊同、前往定購、兩當局為慎防不法市民購糶廉米隱藏或轉售漁利起見、並將於發售時、有所規定、至於其詳細辦法、尚在續商中、惟當局之購辦廉米、其意即在調劑民食、抑平米價為宗旨、故對於市民購糶該項廉米、決使其</p>
<p>自由購買</p>
<p>並鑒於過去米號出售米糧或米行轉售、均被　輩米奸商偷竊米糧、及攙以雜質、曾經市民一再舉發、茲為未雨綢繆、及為眞實　惠平民起見、決將於發售廉價米糧時、飭屬馳赴各米號或米行嚴密監視、</p>

<h3>希望上海醫務人員　自動赴內地服務　紅會工作活躍但人手極缺乏　滬市醫藥人材集幾感過剩</h3>
<p>新聲社云、記者昨遇自內地來滬接洽醫生赴自由中國服務之某負責人士、承談目前內地救護工作發展之情形、及迫切之需要、據稱作戰四年以來、救護工作日趨繁重、因此所需之醫術人員、必須大量增加、今日內地需要三十萬之醫學人才、而其中應有醫師三萬人、但統計現在服務之醫師、僅六千名、較之應有之數、相差甚遠、因之、醫務人員之缺乏、構成內地救護事業之最大困難、他如醫藥器材之接濟、及運輸工具之　陋、亦足牽制事工之進行、此則亟盼</p>
<p>全國同胞</p>
<p>及海外僑胞之熱心贊助與慷慨捐輸也、試以中國紅十字會之工作言之、紅會設總部於貴陽、下設救護隊百餘、每救護隊以醫生一人、女護士二人、助手四人、及擔架隊十人組織之、工作極為活躍、但醫師僅一百七十六人、故難使工作大規模開展、惟各種藥品、尤以奎寗一項、尚感匱乏、故盼望中外熱心人士</p>
<p>源源接濟</p>
<p>以充需要、運輸方面、亦力求改進、過去四年中紅會運輸車所行路程達四百餘萬公里、注射霍亂預防針一千一百餘萬劑、施行外科手術四萬二千餘次、包紥創傷三百八十餘萬起、現有醫師一百七十六人外、另有女護士四四四人、外科助手一〇八一人、外籍醫師約二十人、均係激於義憤而自動來華者、工作劬勞、生活艱苦、但絕無怨言</p>
<p>實堪欽佩</p>
<p>再就目前紅十字會組織　需要之藥品、每月約需美金三十萬元、如能敷用、此大量藥品、在運輸方面、須有一百七十五輛運輸汽車、每月須行走三十萬公里、所需汽油及修理各費、每月亦在美金三十七萬之譜、統此　項　紅會每月需要美金七十萬元左右、此項責任、除由美國紅十字會經常接濟藥品由滇緬路輸入者外、我國人民必須負起</p>
<p>重大責任</p>
<p>此次遍歷自由中國各地來滬、除希望上海人士對內地救護事工感有深刻印象外、並切盼上海四百萬人士、不忽視此種神聖之責任、上海乃醫藥人材　集之區、幾有過剩之患、故鄙人極願以至誠之熱忱、為殷切之呼籲、希望上海之醫務人員、自動赴內地服務、</p>

<h3>外人心目中的上海</h3>
<p>— （弢）</p>
<p>二三月前，我正日夜夢想着我的故鄉上海，有位被德法停戰協定逐出來的歐籍朋友，經過越南逃到上海；到了上海沒多時，就寄我一信，叙述他心目中的上海；我讀了很感動，過不多時，我自己也返到這故鄉來了，再讀讀這信，還有點感觸，譯出來給同鄉們看看也好：</p>
<p>親愛的安特蘭：</p>
<p>在這烽火遍野的暴風雨的環境中，我幸運地安抵了你那可愛的故鄉——上海——這個遠東的大都市，在我初到的人看來，的確很熱鬧和繁華，也並不在歐洲的巴黎·柏林·維也納之下；尤其是這砲聲和炸彈交奏着的世界上，上海仍舊能將醇人的歌樂聲來墊替它，眞夠人尋味陶醉！我初到這裏的幾天，眞不知該將我口袋裏的錢怎樣化法；這裏有高大和各色俱全的大商店，有很好音樂，裝璜甚美的舞廳，有很大的旅館，飯店，電影院，賭塲，以及一切安樂的娛樂塲所，萬想不到大西洋的彼岸現在還是這樣的安靜和平！</p>
<p>許多人說：「上海不是中國的都市，」我來後也有此感，像很多白種人的殖民地一樣，目下的上海是由外人管理着，中國人祗在管理者指揮下工作而已；許多享有特權的外國人在此都已蓋好挺漂亮的別墅大厦，他們在這中國肥沃的土地上，已括起很大資產，中國人亦有很多是闊綽富有的，可是他們大半喜歡和外國人來往，像越南的安南富豪相似，似乎已剝去了他一層黃色的皮子，也早以疑心他究竟是何國籍了！你讀了可別傷心。</p>
<p>有很多的中國人說着流利的外國話，他很瞧不起他的同胞，我初見還疑心他是非列濱人，或是安南緬甸人呢！</p>
<p>我知道二四年前，上海也曾像菲沙巴黎一樣的做過戰塲、可是我來這裏後，亦找不到戰事的遺跡；很多人的言語和動作裏，也不見有捍三四年前的事了！我也知道中日的戰事現在尚在進行中，可是到了上海，要是報上不載這類的新聞，我幾乎也不信還有這戰爭的存在呢！</p>
<p>朋友們吿訴我：「上海是比以前更繁榮了！」我想這是理所當然的；在上海，祗能在戰塲上相見的英國人和德意人，在此地是鄰居，說不定這庇敵對國籍的人民尚有携手共同做事的機會，還有很多的白色俄國人，猶太人，在別外站不住的，到此地都可以安居樂業了！我始終不敢說這裏是那國的領土，也始終不敢認識這奇怪的大都市！</p>
<p>說是上海的娛樂塲所多，其實也不盡然，上海所包括的市區，大槪你也明瞭的；租界裏除了幾個很小的公園和一個跑馬塲外，居民也祗能在電燈光下娛樂而已！我來此後，很少聽得人談及打獵，海濱游泳，郊外聚餐，旅行，一類的字。有人說上海現在又樂繁華的「孤島」我想這確也是個有意義的名稱。（未完）</p>

<h3>美德貿易戰略</h3>
<p>— 美國外交季刋　王懿芳譯</p>
<p>今决大戰，對於未來之國際貿易趨勢，極爲人人所注意。美國爲世界經濟霸王，德國則已有獨吞西歐以與美國爭雄之勢。是以於未來國際經濟中，美德兩國實有舉足輕重之概。本文係美國著名經濟學家W．Bidwell及R．Upgren二人合著，載本年一月份出版之外交季刊。對美國今後所應採取之戰略，頗多暗示。雖渠仍主自由原則，但在集團經濟的主張中已加修改。讀本文可見美德雙方現正勾心鬥角之一斑。本文原係王女十爲中外經濟拔萃月刊譯述者，茲徵得譯者及該刊同意，先在本刊發表，實深感幸。全文甚長，原題「美國國防貿易政策」，此僅節載其有關雙方貿易戰略之一部份，故改此題，以符內容。</p>
<p>—編者</p>
<p>「國防」一名詞，狹義的解釋，即爲防止敵軍登陸，及防止敵國空軍轟炸城市。若國防之定義，果如上述，則美國預防之區域，將限於美國本土，及其屬國。但今日「國防」之廣義解釋，爲保護本國，使國內重要之利益，不受外界威脅；不但實質之物，須不受威脅，即經濟組織之安定，及制度之永久性，亦須不受威脅。國防的意義，　經擴大，預防之區域，亦須　展。美國現時時始思及加拿大，西半球各國　英國；並認淸預防之方法，不只限於戰艦，飛機及坦克車。美國有財政經濟之有力利器，擴充軍備未完成時，可應用經濟利器。此文即詳述美國應用經濟利器，在國際貿易上之買賣力量，及其放款之能力。</p>
<h3>納粹勢力圈一瞥</h3>
<p>現時納粹德國，幾使歐洲大陸，除俄國及巴爾幹Baltic各國外，皆在其政治，軍事控制之下。但德國之勢力，似不能伸展至整個地中海流域及近東。假定德國能在其控制區內完成工業及農業開發，則其潛力更大。若欲尋求各國之聯合勢力，其自給自足及各種力量，皆與德國勢　力敵，而其經濟力量，足以支持近代之海陸軍者，則須聯合除德國勢力以外之世界各國爲一集團。</p>
<p>德國控制區域內之四萬萬居民，內中賅括訓練最良，生產最多熟練工人。此廣大之城區，在北海North　Sea及黑海Black　Sea之間，巴爾幹Baltic及撒拉沙漠Deset　of　Sahara之間，包含各種土壤及氣候·德國，法國，但濱各國Danncbian　States及北菲洲之廣大麥產區；波蘭，捷克及法國之蕃署，甜菜糖產區；西班牙，意大利及法國南部之葡萄園，橄欖林及橘林。大量之煤及鐵，對重工業甚爲重要。一九三七至三八年問，在上述區域內，鐵及銅之生產能力，幾與美國相等，而其造船之能力，超過美國三倍，其比例爲四與一之比。</p>
<p>進出口貿易統計，指示歐洲在經濟方面，已經完成，有完全自給自足之可能。一九三七年歐洲廿六國之國際貿易總値，爲二十萬萬美元。在此數額中，百分之六十爲歐洲各國間之貿易，百分之四十爲與歐洲以外各國之貿易。自一九三七年始，德國實行之雙方貿易政策，因一九三九年九月英國之封鎖，加緊實行，而歐洲各國間之貿易，更形重要。倘德國能保持其對歐陸之政治，重事控制，德國因戰爭之壓力，必將使歐陸自給自足。共方　乃使歐陸各國，盡量向歐洲共他國家購買需嬰之貨品，反之，歐陸各國須將共多餘之貨品，盡量售與歐陸集團國家，如此歐陸間之貿易，可自百分之六十升至百分之七十五。倘此種政策在一九三七年强制實行，歐洲貨品尋求歐　以外市塲之價値，幾將减牛。</p>
<p>集中統制歐陸之進出口貿易，將减少其依賴輸入品之程度，允其爲食料；但工業原料之自給自足，較難成功。現以歐陸爲一集團，一九三七年，其裸麥，小麥，及蕃薯之生產量及消費量，的相平衡。兩種重要飼料，大麥及雀麥之產銷量，亦相平衡。而肉類，牛油及乳酪尙有輸出，但此不能表示眞正之自給自足，因家畜，豬業及乳油工業，多靠輸入之穀，油子及油餅爲飼料也。總之，歐決略减少購買歐非陸集團之貨品至最少限度，歐陸食糧之缺乏，將甚嚴重。糖，牲畜及植物油，將形缺少，歐洲將無茶，咖啡或呵呵，而此種刺激物，於食糧缺乏時期，較爲重要。烟草之消費，若完全由歐陸供給，其數量將减成今日之半數。</p>
<p>在工業原科力面，輸入與輸出之煤及生鐵，互相平衡，此表示近代工業中之兩種重要原料，可以自給自足。兩種非鐵鑛苗，鎂Magiteens及鹽基石Bauxite可自給，但其他多種原料，歐陸集團須依賴集團以外之供給。</p>
<p>納粹德國若能克服近東，並用綜合方法發展工業，即能解決歐洲之油問題。搜集碎金屬，及使用橡皮，棉花及羊毛之替代物，及緊急時期彌補原料缺乏之方法。緊急時期最重要之方法，爲限制平民之消費量，使軍隊中應用之物，不至受限制。但緊急情形，不能持久，而代替品之價値，又甚昂貴；因代替品須用大量之勞工及金錢也。而消費者時覺綜合之產品，不若舶來品之令人滿意。凡　種種於估計歐洲戰後經濟自給自足之效力時，皆須注意。</p>
<h3>納粹計劃對美國影響</h3>
<p>姑認納粹德國欲盡量利用歐洲之天然原料，發展歐　間之相互貿易，减少依賴非歐集團之供給；而假定此種經濟政策，將獲成功，如此對美國之利益，將有何影響？用何種政策方能保護美國之利益？</p>
<p>納粹經濟政策成功後，歐陸需用之製成品，無疑的多數將由德國供給。其結果爲美國對歐陸之輸出貿易，將受重大之損失。數十年間，因美國經濟之變遷，及大西洋兩岸國家之報復關稅政策，美國在歐陸市塲之貿易，已形跌落。然在一九三七年，輸往歐陸之製成品，仍値三萬四千五百萬元，半製品及原料，的値四萬六千三百萬元。此項貿易的爲美國同額輸出品之百分之十九及三十一。</p>
<p>歐洲即在新制度之下，倘其經濟機能發揮效力，每年尙需要價値一十萬萬元之原料及飼料。其購物之付價，自然由歐陸工廠之產品償還。因此，在世界市塲中，尤其在南美洲，歐陸之製成品，必與其他各國之貨品有劇烈之競爭。在此次戰爭爆發以前，歐陸市塲，銷售南美輸出品之半數。德國為統制歐陸之購買力，可以雙方大量購買之協定，壟斷歐陸小瞬之國際貿易，如此幾可逐出美國在歐陸市塲之貿易</p>
<p>美國如何方能防止其利益之被威脅？美國企圖在其領導之下，組織一種集團，使其經濟及軍事之潛勢力，皆與歐陸集團相埒，甚或超過之。貿易及生產統計，指明吾人須聯台西半球，英帝國，荷屬東印度等，即聯合非德集團之世界各國。但德國勢力下之歐洲，仍可以其軍事優勢，佔領鄰近區域。再者，吾人組織未完成時，或與日本巳先開戰。</p>
<h3>米價如何可平？</h3>
<p>— 鮑樂蒂</p>
<p>本市的民食，並無問題；問題只在對於飛漲中的米價，竟似沒有辦法。眞的沒有辦法嗎？不！只在市政當局有無堅持平衡米價的決心。</p>
<p>平衡米價，應該當做警務工作之一。警律是絕對的，關於米市塲的一切法令，也應該是絕對的。不能因爲米業掮客等的拒絕入塲，便懷疑限價政策不妥而撤消。如果道樣辦，那比潮濕爆竹更不如了。</p>
<p>要確保本市民食的恒久沒有問題，只有二個辦法：一個便是鼓勵米糧進口，而非限制米糧進口。因爲米糧進口是多多益善的。所以在商營進口之外，市政當局理應盡一切可能，便利商營運米進口，同時復直接公營米糧進口，以防止進口商操縱市價。但決不能因爲市政當局在直接公營米糧進口了，便拒絕商人運米來滬。如果這樣辦，這不是在充實本市的民食，却變成與民爭利而置民食於不顧。據昨天晚報所載，公共租界當局計劃担任本市米糧輸出入的專營權。食米出口的專營是合理的，而且是必要的。但輸入也有實行專營之說，似乎未必確實。除非當局絕對負担長期而又無限制供給平米時，輸入專營，才算台理。吾則，不能不令人想起過去的所謂評價會，常常「在半路裏放下担子不走了」的那種事情。</p>
<p>僅僅注　供給而不管分配，這與僅僅管理分配而不注意供給，同樣是徒勞的。所以在鼓勵米糧進口的同時，仍非嚴厲管理米市不可。直到現在爲止，市政當局對於米市的管理問題，似乎已用過一番心思。但不幸的，那些心思，反供米　抬價操縱的機會。試翻開過去米價上漲的經過，沒有一决大漲風，不是由宜佈新限價後發現的。我們不是說：限價即所以漲價；我們只是說：因因爲當局只限價而不積極維護限價，因而反促成米蠶在市塲上的反動。限價政策是平衡米價上絕對不可少的手段，但必須嚴厲消滅一切違法的交易做條件才行。過去限價的政策之失敗，只因祇寫一張限價的佈吿，只讓各報發表當局力維限價的決心。限價之不能維持而反成刺激市塲的因素，當然不是偶然的事了。</p>
<p>要維持限價，唯一的條件，就是要維持市政當局的威信。前面已經說過：平衡米價應該當做警務工作。警律是絕對的，所以限價也是對絕的。如果因爲有暗盤，便撤消限價。那末因爲有盜案發生，也可以撤銷治盜的警　。這太豈有此理了。</p>
<p>記得在本刋上，曾主張過吊銷違限交易的營業執照，同時沒收其違限交易品，並按限價强制收買其存米，而以此種米糧，作爲米糧公營制度的基礎。這確是一個有力的辦法。或以爲此種辦法，未免欠民主，甚至會招致全市米業罷市的危險。共實是毫無問題的。</p>
<p>先就民主來說：公營制度根本就是民主的產物。强制收買，又爲非常時期常有的政策。何况對於糧食問題，像倫敦等且實施計口授糧，禁止米糧私藏，較公營更來得嚴厲多多。何况違法的交易品，性質上和刦掠賊贓無異，理應予以沒收，不容寬待。</p>
<p>至於米業罷市的危險，確在意料之中。用罷市來反抗限價的事，過去已有所見，但當局如果確具平衡本市民食的話，罷市非特不足以加重民食困難，抑且反足以促成本市民食政策的健全。因爲米蠶之罷市，可省去吊銷營業執照的一種手續，立即强制收買所有罷業者的存米，而實行米糧的公營。此項收買經費，須於公營出售後支付。如果當局確具限價的決心，那末米　也決不敢冉以罷業來要挾。</p>
<h3>看到聽到想到</h3>
<p>「四行事件給予市塲的刺激，不可謂不大；何以四行復業了，市塲上却未引起什麼好影響」？有人以此相詢，我的答復是「利用四行事件而做多頭投機的，進價都很貴。若倉惶翻空，就要一敗塗地。何况賊不空手，即使偷不到財帛，也得拾塊磚頭，取個「吉利」。試看目前各種投機市塲，收盤價總比開盤價小；這就是那批多頭掩護撤兵的戰略。等別人發覺時，他們都已變成空城計裹的諸葛亮；於是市價一瀉而下，拔脚慢的便片甲不留」。</p>
<p>其實工部局在四行復業的機會上，倒取得了一個鳴金收兵之計·「爲了四行停業，唯恐市塲大變，故不得不限制米價；四行旣已復業，限價自應取消」。誰曰不宜？</p>
<p>但是使我想起某君戲贈靑蓮閣的一付楹聯來。上聯是「百姓餓死餓死皆餓死」；下聯是「米蟲萬歲萬歲億萬歲」。雖不工，倒也千眞萬確。</p>
<p>有人拿「美國凍結外國在美資金，何以必先官傳」來問。我的答復是：「除政治作用外，另有經濟作用。因爲他小怕外國資金的逃避，獨怕留着不逃，隨時購貨。所以他一面擴大禁運軍需品的範圍，一面又以「凍結」的宣傳，來嚇　這批外國資金，使他們變成「紙幣」形態而逃出美國國境。如果牠們甘做俘虜，美國財部自然慷慨收容」。</p>
<p>公用事業將加價百分之百，這派頭不愧爲「洋氣十足」。</p>
<h3>國防貿易計劃如何</h3>
<p>美國之國際貿易，欲不受物物交易，及雙方協定之限制，首先應增進其與加拿大及加瑞濱Caribbean諸國之貿易。美國與加拿大之政治聯繫，因設立、永久國防聯合委員會Permavent　Jaint　Boord　on　Defenese而更重要。</p>
<p>美國對墨西哥及克瑞濱區域Caribbeanregion之貿易，原佔優勢，其主要產物，香蕉，咖啡等，與美國之農產物，互相補益。但糖，石油及銅，則爲競爭之物品，但美國能大量吸收之，在經濟上仍不致紊亂。</p>
<p>軍事預防，雖甚動呼，但在經濟方面，對於美國之貿易問題，却不能有適當之解決。美國與加拿大及加瑞濱Caribbean諸國最自由之貿易，亦不能銷售十五萬萬元之製成品，而此數額在國外市塲却能銷售。加拿大每年過剩之二萬萬至二萬五千萬浦式耳之麥，亦無法尋求買主。吾人須知加拿大西方二百五十萬居民，其進款之半數，來自小麥輸出之盈餘。</p>
<p>加瑞濱Caribbean諸國之輸出品，亦有盈餘。即經濟方面與美國有聯繫之國家，每年在西半球外銷售之糖，咖啡，石油及銅，其價値亦超過五萬萬元。倘美國及加拿大之經濟欲其平穩，顯然須擴大貿易之範圍。</p>
<p>為使集團貿易有效起見，須有下列條件：（一）在規定區內之貿易，其基本工業須有互相補助之益。（二）近代工業及軍事預防上之重要原料，多數須能自給。西半球之惰形却未能適合上述集團貿易之條件。</p>
<p>美國今日之兩種對外政策如下：（一）在經濟及軍事上防禦西半球之安全。（二）用各種方法協助英帝國反抗軸心勢力。美國公民在最近選舉總統運動時，表示完全擁護此兩項政策。</p>
<p>歐洲戰事結束之結果，不外下列三種情形：（一）英國全勝，即等於傾覆納粹勢力，解放歐洲共和國。（二）德國全勝，英國將與歐陸集團合作，英帝國將被分割，艦隊將被毀減。（三）雙方陷於困境而講和，則希特勒仍將稱覇歐陸，英國仍擁有其艦隊及帝國。</p>
<p>假定歐洲之結果為上述任何一項，則美國須有假定之政策適合其情形。但如此並不能解決今日之情形。因今日美國人之重要論點不在「戰爭結束後，美國與歐洲之貿易如何？」而在「如何使戰爭之結果，對美最為有利。」</p>
<p>德國全勝，顯然將限制美國之自由國外貿易及國外事件。美國商人將在納粹貿易協定網內活動，美國爲自衛起見，不得不實行一種西半球或西北半球貿易政策，以調和其經濟。</p>
<p>但吾人須知無論英國全勝或講和，美國將不重建世界自由貿易政策。英國因戰事而引起之經濟改革，即在戰後，其對內對外仍須繼續戰時之統制貿易政策，一九三九年以前，着重於雙方貿易之傾向，已甚明顯。但雙方貿易政策是吾永久，將視西半球之貿易情形而定，將視美國能否保持自由貿易之區域而定。</p>
<p>上述意見之結論有二：（一）美國用各種方法盡量加緊援英，增建飛機及船隻之數量，其信用及船隻受强生條例Johnson　Act及中立條例Neutsaility　Act限制者，即行解禁。（二）戰爭繼續進行時，擴大其協助。戰爭結束後，爲欲壟斷納粹統制貿易，故現時須計劃一種西半球及英帝國之經濟集團。</p>
<p>一年以前，此種建議議似不需要。半年前，此種建議仍似不需要。但今日因明瞭納粹之威脅，及英國抗戰之力量，吾人須準備大胆而積極之方法。此爲根據經濟利益之聯合。在政治方面，凡傾向民主思想，而其信仰被人侵犯者，皆與之聯合。</p>
<p>政治聯繫之組織不在此文範圍之內，但特惠關稅Pveferential　taxiffs及滙率之穩定，顯然賅括在政治聯繫之內，上述與他國政治聯繫之目的，並非使各聯繫國减少對外貿易至最小數額。若有適當之防衛，吾人甚願與他國或共他集團互相貿易。他國若能在自由原則上貿易，吾人當與之發生聯繫。是故凡愛好和平及自由之國家，皆可加入此聯繫集團。在集團之內，可互相放款，借款，移民及貿易，而無剝削及壓迫之恐懼。</p>

<h3>戰時歐洲鑽石業的命運</h3>
<p>— 續一日農</p>
<p>（五）荷比所受的影響</p>
<p>英國政府這種雷厲風行的舉措，叫荷蘭比利時幾個鑽石工業中心的城市，受到莫大的影響。本來從開戰以來，鑽石商巳竟碰到幾個不可解決的棘手問題了，如同戰爭時這種奢侈品銷路的困難，往海外運輸時海上的不保險，各國貨幣連繫的不安定，允其是鑽石業生死所繫的美國！……現在又遇着這原料來路的限制和斷絕，還有侵略國家的躍躍欲試，隨時有侵入本國的可能，在這種緊張氣氛下的鑽石業，如何鎭靜如恒的維持下去呢？所以在德國沒有侵人以前，已竟有盎維爾斯城許多鑽石商決定以遷地爲良：計在一九三九年的九月後，的有一百家重要的大店舖，紛紛的遷往美國，巴西，葡萄牙，或其他更安全的地方。你想這種移殖，不特是幾個平凡的商人而已：速掮客，工匠，技師，一切和鑽石有連帶關係的人員，大批外流！有人統計在盎維爾斯一城，巳經有熟練於此道的工人三萬名！這種避居海外的行動，在被敵人侵入以後，想米是更要積極。這無疑的是對於荷蘭，比利時的經濟上一種不可補救的重大根失！而况這些遷走的人，大概短時期中是不會重返故里的。特別是戰爭還要延長下去；就假定他們將來還能回國，那也巳經在海外，在他國，造成給自己能够競爭的工匠，和技師了：因爲他們業中的秘密，無疑的是耍盡被旁人窺其底蘊的！</p>
<p>（六）結論</p>
<p>結論是：鑽石這種奢侈工業，它仗恃着嚴密的組織，豐厚的資財，特別的技術，或者比其他奢侈工業不容易受戰爭的淘汰。可是它在歐洲舊大陸上—這常常被戰爭，革命，擾亂，所支配着的舊大陸！——已竟找不到它生存所必需的環境和條件了；這種環境和條件，如同市塲主顧等等，它只能在新大陸，特別的是美國尋得着：那麼，它或者永遠捨棄了它的誕生地麼？……</p>

<h3>修學講座　怎樣擇書　（一）</h3>
<p>— 周良生</p>
<p>古今來的書籍、多得不可計數、拿我們有限的歲月、想遍讀無窮的書籍、那是辦不到的、莊子說、「吾生也有涯、而知也無涯、以有涯隨無涯、殆巳」、我們非但沒有時間去一一遍讀、根本也沒有遍讀的必要、我們只要在那無窮的書籍中、加以選擇就行了、書籍的本質、有好有壞、質好的書籍、讀了固然有益、若是質壞的呢、讀了反而有害、怎樣選擇書籍、確是一個很重要的問題、現在、分「探書原則」和「擇書標準」兩項說明如下、</p>
<p>一　擇書原則</p>
<p>讀書和生活兩件事、應該聯成一氣打成一片、讀書並不是點綴風雅的勾當、它是改進生活豐富生活的手段、書籍也並不只是茶餘酒後的消遣品、它是培養生活上知識技能的工具、我們選擇書籍、要有一個明確的原則、它是什麽呢、就是、「適合自己的需要」、換句話說、就是、一個人該讀什麽書、該看什麽書、只依着自己的生活來選擇、</p>
<p>（一）關於自身職務的　各人的職務旣然不同、那末各人選擇應該讀的或能够讀的書、就不一樣、文學家應該閱讀的書和科學家不同、政治家應該閱讀的書和實業家也不同、例如夏丏尊說的、「做內科醫生的人、第一應該要閱讀的是關於內科的書籍雜誌、這是關於職務的閱讀」、</p>
<p>（二）關於參考硏究的　各人職務不同、各人作硏究上的參考、當然也不一樣、例如夏丏尊說的、「如果這位醫生因了瘧疾的研究、而注意到蚊子的種類、便　翻閱某種生物學書、因瘧蚊的分佈、便去翻閱某種地理書、因了某種藥物的性質、便去檢查某種的植物書礦物書、囚了某一辭兒的懷疑去翻查某種辭典、這是參考的閱讀」、</p>

<h3>丁福保先生談　吃白米的壞處</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>昨與無錫丁福保先生，討論衛生方　時講起食的問題，渠謂，近來都市中人往往年未滿老半百，已鬚髮斑白，步履維艱，彎腰曲背，皺紋滿面，目力與記憶力銳减者，此種早老之原因，雖或為色欲過度，或因嗜好太深，或由處境不佳，或緣憂傷太過，不僅一端，而食品之不完全，實為最重要之一。何謂不完全之食品？即其所有之主要成分，祇有熱量較少之炭水化合物，對於我人身體最切要之其他有機性無機性營養素及副養素，皆付缺如。現在上海有錢有閒階級寓公鉅賈，每日所食之白米，即為營養上最劣之食品。試將白米與糙米所含之成分相比較，即可知糙米較白米優。舊白米含粗蛋白質百分之六，八，粗脂肪百分之〇，三，粗炭水化物百分之七二，〇，無機質百分之〇，三五，甲種維他命與乙種維他命俱備，故糙米所含之有機性無機性與補助營養素，大致完備，已為近於完全之食品矣。惜上海之闊老，嫌其食時不若白米之容易下咽而鄙視之，不知以前用人力所椿之米，穀皮以及無成穀皮的纖維，（此物對於腸管有適度之器械的刺戟，能促進其蠕動，使大便通暢，而免在腸中停滯腐敗），其碾白之米，且於糙米中加入白石細粉，碾白後光滑而美觀。此種白石細粉，有碍衛生，苟以顯微鏡紐視之，有無數狀如碎玻璃者，嵌入米中，雖煮飯前將米淘過，但此種黏附於米之石粉，終難完全洗去。仍有一部分隨白米飯而不知不覺進入人之胃腸，年　月久，即與身體有關。鄙意糙米飯煮得得法，吃時亦不致不能下咽，我家煮糙米飯，先一晚即將糙米洗去所附之塵埃，連水浸於鍋內，次日先用强火煮至噴出蒸氣，即將火力减至一半，經二十分間，火力又减至六分之一，最後將鍋蓋按住，而又加强火力，半分間遂熄滅，少頃取食，滋味與消化力並皆佳妙。倘一般摩登人物，實在吃不慣糙米飯，不妨改吃不用白粉之半搗米飯，或半搗米加麥少許而同煮。一言蔽之，現在上海之所謂頭號上白米者，形式確如珍珠而美麗，實際缺乏有機性無機性營養素與副營養素，簡直可以稱為失去滋養質之糟粕耳。日吃等於糟粕之白米飯，歷時旣久，安得而不早老。予因丁先生係有名之衛生家，年已六十有五，輕健如四十左右，且其所言合於科學而有至理，用特表而出之。</p>
<h3>布角的利用</h3>
<p>— 兆</p>
<p>我們，裁製衣褲的時候，不是有很多剩餘的布角嗎？的確，這些紅的綠的各色各樣的布角，我們除了將它換糖吃外，甚至糖擔上也嫌過碎小哩！簡直可說是毫無些微用處，但是我們如果貿然把它棄掉的話，那實在覺得太可惜了。我們想：一方面面料須要以過多少農人，工人，商人辛苦淌着血汗的勞動才成功呢？况且目前布不讓米，價値也驣貴得驚人呢！因此我們與其棄掉，那我們不如把它好好的利用一下呢！</p>
<p>我們睡覺所必須而少不了的那當然是一具枕頭了，近來一具繡花的枕頭的價値也着實可觀，如果是自己繡吧！花綫又昂貴得很，而且還得耗費很多的光陰和增加麻煩。這便是我們布角利用的機會了。</p>
<p>我們先以花樣描在布角上，譬如紅的花；我們便把它描在紅的布角上，綠色的葉子，那當然是利用綠色的布角了。然後我們逐樣把它裁剪下來，再用綫縫在枕頭佈上面，手續好比是小學生的剪貼手工一樣，不過一個是用將糊黏，一個是以縫綫吧了。不要費多大的功夫，經濟而美觀的枕頭已製就了。</p>
<p>我希望大家都來一試。並得隨時注意廢物之利用，以符合節約之道，養成節約之美德。</p>
<h3>家庭佈置的美惡</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>「筆硯精良，人生一樂」，推而廣之，一個家庭也確有同樣的情形，一般普通的家庭；灰黑的牆壁，半榻的床舖，傾斜的床帳，三隻脚的椅子，蹺起不平的檯面，地板上滿列着排泄物。就算主中饋的，是一個天仙化人，風姿絕世的安琪兒，恐怕美色的誘惑力，敵不住這骯髒的環境，不由得要使你望而却步吧！</p>
<p>但是這般人，也許是限於經濟，雖欲整齊一點，事實，或有辦不到，讓我們把他當作例外。現在，再看有錢的人，花磚砌成的油壁，但天花板上的積塵，可作蝴蝶舞。是上等柚木的沙發，但靠背上的油膩，也許你坐上去，會給你加染一种顏色。火爐是放在走路口，小孩的尿布，掛在客堂中，六月裏，還垂着法蘭絨的窗帘，十二月裏吊着不曾包紮過的風扇。書報，大衣，一切什用的物件，到處都是，毫無秩序。一個家庭在這樣佈置之下，旁人見了，也要乏味，何况主人，主婦，天天居住其中。見到的；都是一種雜亂的印象，一爭都是雜亂，雜亂！當然會不知不覺地引起煩惱，厭惡，永遠鼓不起家庭間原有的興趣來。</p>
<p>大凡一個人，最怕的是引起煩惱，在可厭的空氣中，我們會說平時，所不說的話，作平時不能作的事，能使一個善於溫柔體貼的人，性情變作暴戾凶惡，很容易得罪人，即使是一件很平凡而不關重要的事：</p>
<p>「手套呢？」夫不耐煩地問。</p>
<p>「好好的放在書架上的，怎麽不見了」？妻找了半天找不到，面上也出現慍色了！</p>
<p>「在衣櫃內吧！」但是結果，依然沒有找到，反拖出了許多圍巾，綫團，不相干的東西，這時，伊心裏當然非覺着麻煩，而且引起怒意了。</p>
<p>「自己的東西，一點也記不得嗎？」伊更有說不出的怨恨，也許因更會得想到他另外許多種種的短處。</p>
<p>他呢，自然感到莫明其妙的煩惱，於無可歸咎中，歸咎到伊的不是。於是，從前對於伊滿意的，或許現在認以為缺憾，從前以為可愛的，也許現在以為不可愛了。</p>
<p>各個想着各個的不是，於是漸漸的，夫妻間的情愛，會這樣地起了裂痕，以至於不能維持！</p>
<p>所以希望一般新家庭的主婦與主人，對於家庭的佈置，加以相當的注意，不要在雜亂過生活，務使各個得當，應改良的改良，應廢除的廢除。</p>
<p>使得大家對於家庭，都保持原有好感，自然，無形中，我們會得到許多安慰快樂。同時夫婦間的情感，也可以由此而愈開鞏固了。</p>

<h3>一星期家常菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>新蠶豆又上市了；這類東西，真是暮春唯一的俊物，使人百吃不厭的。在戰前新上市時，每斤至多不過一二十個銅元，現在却要半塊錢一斤，就是這幾天也要二角左右，真是一般主婦們有不勝今昔之感了。然而貴雖貴，吃却不能不吃，隻得大家在筷頭上節省一些，再也不能暢暢快快的大嚼了。講到葷的做法，可與肉丁筍丁同炒，或者略加火腿，炊白湯吃，自是鮮美可口。素的做法可與雪菜末竹筍丁或萵苣同炒，也是其味無窮的。不過，糖要多放一些。</p>
<p>星期一　蠶豆炒肉丁　炊塘鯉魚湯　淸炒雞毛菜　油條黃豆芽</p>

<h3>由昆明到臘戌</h3>
<p>— 觀射</p>
<p>一個朋友的來信：</p>
<p>我此番由昆明赴臘戌，是坐的公司中特備的卡車。普通行程約五天至七天，我因為中間有躭擱，走了十一天方到。此路全長一一四六·一公里，十分之八是山路，環繞高山而行，蜿蜒曲折；無十丈以上的直路，可見修築的不易了。天子廟坡和級三坡，均高約三千公尺，當車至山項時，由車內俯瞰山下茅屋，幾不可見。二月十四日由昆明動身，十六日宿下關（四一一·六公里），已領略狂風滋味。雲南有歌謠：「下關風，畹町花，蒼山雪，洱海月」可見「下關風」的出名了，洱海距下關甚近，惜無時間往遊。十七日因阻雨宿漾濞—一個不滿十戶人家的小村莊—遙看蒼山，雪猶未化。兩日之間，四景遇其二，也足以慰旅程之辛苦。漾濞距昆明四四九·二公里，屬雲南永平縣。十八晨雨止，乃復登程；車向高山急駛，白雲冉冉，隨車輪轉滾，宛如駕雲飛行，景象奇絕，行至五三〇公里左右，路側有大石碑，上書「漢諸葛武候七擒孟獲處」，回想幼時看三國演義的叙述，不禁悠然神往。車行繞至山巔，遠看蒼山雪為日光籠照，至為美麗。因須渡過一橋，故十八十九兩夜均宿在車上，睡在西裝箱上，居然一枕黑甜，及今思之，可發一笑，在此時期，幸始終未逢警報；十九夜三時許，安然渡過瀾蒼江，此渡船之輕妙快速，不能不佩服工程師之聰明；瀾江雖險，我人能在陸地用汽車拖此新頴渡船過江，且每小時能來回各渡五輛，可見人力勝天，惟憑弔殘橋，仍不能不增人悵惘也。（未完）</p>

<h3>急</h3>
<p>— 覺慧</p>
<p>當局的「辦法」畢竟被千呼萬喚地「想」出來了，一百另十雙老洋一石的米到香港辦去，這事無疑會「哄動」一時。</p>
<p>別的先不說，單是「辦法」公布以後，就急壞了許多人！</p>
<p>窮人固然急，「蛀蟲」更急；前者的是萬一「中途變卦」，後者急的是恨不得跑到香港去把肚子頂住米袋！</p>
<p>然而窮人急的不止此，「蛀蟲」急的也不止此國窮人急的是恐怕米辦到後又要被囤了去產，蛀蟲急的是米辦到後自己將逃不過「黃霉」關口，「天災人禍」眞不得了！</p>
<p>於是你急我急，急得大家團團轉……。</p>
<h3>又一個同事</h3>
<p>— 司馬駿</p>
<p>說也奇怪，人死會這麼容易，這麼迅速，這麼唐突，不是死總死了，死後也不再希奇，不再古怪，就丟致腦後算了。</p>
<p>然而我的廠裏，三年來倒死了三個同事，留下三個年輕寡婦，這事，要說牠希奇，當然也可列在一談。</p>
<p>不過死去的三個同事，像他們這樣年輕力壯，不勝惋惜之至，因為他都是生產者。</p>
<p>至於最近死的一個同事，當他死的前幾天，我們感到他的神經錯亂得非常厲害，說話無頭無腦，做事也就不到五分鐘就要垂下頭，吃飯時，他會很快的吃二口，然後也就丟了筷，莫名其妙的闔上眼了。</p>
<p>想像他的病症，我們以為他是精神衰弱，工作過度所致，但沒有誰知道他，他害的是金錢病，金錢的刺激。</p>
<p>記得有一次，他大槪去看醫生回來，臉孔本來已很清癯了，走路遲慢的，他碰見我，劈頭就問我：</p>
<p>「你們現在一千元錢總有了吧！」</p>
<p>「什麼？」我驚訝的望他。</p>
<p>「靠十年了呢，一千元錢會沒有多？」</p>
<p>我朝他笑笑，因為他的形態變得非常奇突。</p>
<p>「我！」他自己指指胸脯，「背了一筆債。唉！」</p>
<p>我知道他因為病用去很多錢，看見我們身體健旺，於是聯想一定多幾個錢了，誰知道小職員在現情況下，度日如登天呢？</p>
<p>「祗有你這年頭想多錢！」</p>
<p>我想同他說，可是他是一個金錢病者。不過他的金錢病，是希望不致挨餓，並不像投機瘋狂的金錢病者。所以他病着，還是管住自己的職守，努力自己應盡的工作。</p>
<p>在死的一前一晚，他的神志忽然模糊了，嘴脣成紫褐色，抖着氣，四肢不斷的抽動，一忽兒坐，一忽兒立，不想去睡，即使睡也不到五分鐘就坐了起來，看他的樣子，像有一事件緊逼他似的，使他非常不安。</p>
<p>那一天晚上，去叫了他的夫人，我們當然陪着一夜，摸摸他的心臓，跳躍得非常激烈，問他的夫人道：</p>
<p>「他在看什麼醫生呢？」</p>
<p>「誰知道他，說是神經病醫院看神經病。」</p>
<p>「那末。他到底什麼病？」</p>
<p>「這病誰知道呢」</p>
<p>午夜後，打了幾個電話叫醫生，不是醫生都推說遲了，祗能期待着天明。</p>
<p>天亮後，廠長同醫生一同進來，他的神志忽然非常清晰了，認識了人，而且講話有頭有腦。</p>
<p>醫生把過脈，要把握他的病症非騐血不成，廠長也贊成送醫所去住。</p>
<p>他是認識醫生的，於是句句追問着。</p>
<p>「要不要緊呢？醫生說我第八條神經出毛病，一個禮拜，一個禮拜包看好。」</p>
<p>「勿要緊的，勿是神經病！」</p>
<p>醫生與廠長談的話，他都聽見，他湊上來說：</p>
<p>「我住醫院，工錢不要扣我，廠長，你人答應。」他突然合着雙手，對醫生拜着：「你救救我，讓我住醫院去！」</p>
<p>「你不要裝神經病！」</p>
<p>「不，我受刺激，這刺激非常深，我不能把牠忘記了，錢，金錢！」</p>
<p>「醫生說：「錢用得完的，賺得來的，何必多想牠呢」！」</p>
<p>他不響了，坐在凳上，下午到醫院去一趟，因為沒有三等病舖，檢查了一下，仍舊回來，不是這晚，半夜就劇變了，出着汗，透着氣，到三時死了。</p>
<p>我們被悽慘的哭聲哭酸，我想這樣又死了一個同事，然而還是怎樣的一回事呢？命運乎？社會乎？</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（七）臉上劃一個十字</p>
<p>他竭力忍住了痛，把頭一掙，便馬上掙脫了季兆雄的手，一面把兩顆充滿着怒火的眸子很有力地向他臉上轉了一轉，兩條眉毛也突然豎了起來，他決定不顧一切的反抗了！</p>
<p>「還有誰嗎？不錯，還有一個！」他的目眦欲裂的神氣倒果然懾住了季兆雄的氣熖，使他不再有所妄動，而秋海棠的目光也就接着移到了袁寶藩的臉上。「這一個人就是你！」</p>
<p>老袁倒也詫異得說不出話來了。</p>
<p>「你能告訴我嗎？她是你的什麼人？當初你又用什麼手段把她騙來的」秋海棠的聲音簡直越說越響起來。「你要審問我，對不起，還是先審問你自己！」</p>
<p>這倒是袁寶藩所從沒有碰過的大釘子。</p>
<p>「他媽的！打死你這兎崽子」說着，他已跳上去接連在秋海棠的臉上打了兩個嘴巴。</p>
<p>「打得好，總有一天你也要惡貫滿盈的！」</p>
<p>大量的鮮血從秋海棠的嘴脣裏流出來，他却還是睜圓了眼睛大罵。「就是把我打死，你也還一頭專吸民脂民膏的是死亡八！」</p>
<p>院子裏站着的幾個當差險些兒不笑出來。</p>
<p>「還不快把我的手槍拿來嗎？」袁寶藩氣得暴跳如雷的喊着。</p>
<p>有一個馬弁已移動脚步想走了，但季兆雄却突然攔住了他。</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Troops' Counter-Offensive Brings Successive Victories: Huangyan and Haimen Recovered One After Another; Chinese Troops Enter Wenzhou, Citizens Hold Celebratory Rally</h3>
<p>Jinhua: As Japanese troops retreat from Yongjia City towards Duan'an, Chinese troops continue to pursue them after recovering Yongjia City (Telegraph from the 3rd).</p>
<p>Jinhua: After Yongjia City was recovered by Chinese troops, the residents saw the light of day again and were overjoyed. On the 3rd, citizens throughout the city held a celebratory rally, national flags fluttered, and cheers resounded everywhere (Telegraph from the 3rd).</p>
<p>Jinhua: After Chinese troops conquered Huangyan, they continued their attack towards Haitou. Unable to withstand the pressure from the Chinese troops, the Japanese troops set fire to the town on the night of the 2nd, filling the air with red light. Chinese troops seized the opportunity to launch a fierce attack, and the Japanese troops fled to their ships in disarray. At dawn on the 3rd, Chinese troops entered the town and comforted the displaced (Telegraph from the 3rd).</p>
<p>Somewhere in Eastern Zhejiang: On the 2nd, Chinese troops began their counter-offensive, capturing Yongjia City (Wenzhou) in one fell swoop. Starting from the 1st, Chinese counter-offensive units began operations. At dawn on the 2nd, Chinese troops launched a large-scale attack in two directions. Chinese artillery provided cover for the infantry's advance. The Japanese troops stubbornly resisted from their fortifications, but the Chinese troops fought bravely. The Japanese forces were overwhelmed, and the Chinese troops successively captured strongholds such as Shuangfen Mountain and Wenchang Pavilion in the western suburbs, and Xishan in the northwest suburbs. As a result, all the outer strongholds of Yongjia fell into Chinese hands. The Chinese troops then pressed forward with increasing momentum. At 11:00 AM, they stormed into the West Gate of Yongjia and continued to exert pressure on the areas south and east of the city with their powerful force, engaging in street fighting with the Japanese troops at the South Gate, annihilating countless Japanese soldiers. Unable to hold out, the Japanese troops retreated towards the southwest and west gates. The Chinese troops then decisively captured Yongjia City. The Chinese troops also ambushed the Japanese troops south of the city and at the West Gate. In this battle, over a thousand Japanese soldiers were killed, and only a few managed to break through and escape. The Chinese troops are now advancing towards Ruian, sweeping away the Japanese troops (Telegraph from the 3rd).</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Raid Chongqing, Only Five Killed</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The authorities announced last night that yesterday, Japanese planes once again attempted to repeat the story of May 3, 1939, when they bombed and killed 5,000 people. However, as a result of the raid, only five people were killed and eleven were injured. The Japanese planes dropped about 500 bombs yesterday, destroying about 50 houses and causing six fires, which were extinguished within half an hour. After the raid, Chairman Chiang immediately ordered the National Relief Association to provide each displaced person with a relief fund of 20 yuan (Associated Press dispatch from the 4th).</p>
<p>Chongqing: Japanese planes bombed Chongqing yesterday. The branch office of the Haitong News Agency in the city was hit and suffered heavy losses. Fortunately, no employees were injured (Haitong News Agency dispatch from the 4th).</p>
<h3>China Increases Combat Strength</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: A member of the Chinese Nationalist Party who went to Chongqing to attend an important Party affairs meeting and has now returned here said that the US government's suggestion to strengthen China's economic resources to support the war against Japan has been adopted by the Chinese government. This policy includes increasing land taxes, controlling consumption, allocating food by the state, and remitting land taxes from various provinces to the central government. The person who drafted this plan is Dr. Currie, an advisor to President Roosevelt. It is said that Dr. Currie stated that this wartime policy should have been implemented earlier to facilitate combat operations. The newly established Food Supply Department will be established soon to prevent price increases and ensure that the people do not starve. Several places in Guangdong, Fujian, Yunnan, and Sichuan provinces are currently facing widespread famine (International News Service dispatch from the 4th).</p>
<h3>Counties in Sichuan Promote Aircraft Donation Campaign</h3>
<p>Chengdu: Since the Sichuan Branch of the Aviation Construction Association launched the campaign to donate 100 aircraft in Sichuan Province, it has been actively carrying out its work. Donation committees in various counties and cities have also been established one after another and have begun fundraising. Xuanhan County alone has already raised 80,000 yuan in national currency and remitted it to the province. The results of the aircraft donation campaign throughout Sichuan in the future will certainly be considerable (Telegraph from the 3rd).</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhongzhi Invents Economical Telephone</h3>
<p>Ji'an: Zhang Zhongzhi, the captain of the Jiangxi Telecommunications Brigade, has recently invented a type of economical telephone. It has now been completely successful. The materials used are only wood and copper, so the value is low, only two-tenths of that of a Siemens telephone. The effectiveness is excellent, and the sound is clear. Only two small flashlight batteries are needed for application. The application method and style are the same as those of the Siemens machine. It is now being manufactured in large quantities. The Jiangxi Provincial Government and the Telecommunications Brigade have adopted it quite a bit. It is reported that a prototype has been submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for patent approval (Telegraph from the 4th).</p>
<h3>Various Circles in the Capital Hold "May Fourth" Commemorative Meeting; Telegraphs Greetings to Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Various circles in the capital held a May Fourth Commemorative Meeting at the Experimental Theater this morning. More than a hundred people attended, including Gu Zhenggang, Minister of Social Affairs, and Chen Fangxian, Chairman of the Municipal Party Committee. After Chairman Kang Ze led the participants in observing the ceremony, he delivered an opening speech, followed by a speech by Gu Zhenggang. The meeting then passed a resolution to telegraph greetings to Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang, and to send condolences to the soldiers at the front. Finally, the meeting ended with music (Telegraph from the 4th).</p>
<p>Guiyang: A Youth Day Commemorative Meeting was held in Guiyang today. Over ten thousand people attended. Huang Yuren presided over the meeting and reported on the significance of the commemoration. The meeting passed a resolution to telegraph greetings to Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang, and to send condolences to the soldiers at the front, encouraging the youth and students in the war zone and the occupied areas to fight to the end. After the meeting, they marched in formation, and the enthusiasm was extremely high (Telegraph from the 4th).</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Refutes Japanese Rumors</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, wrote an article in the Army's newspaper, Saodang Bao, today refuting the Japanese claim that China is not a democratic country and predicting that Britain and the United States will defeat Japan, Germany, and Italy in this war. President Sun said that Japan is spreading rumors that "China is not a democratic country" in the hope of preventing Britain and the United States from assisting China. President Sun pointed out that all of China's doctrines are based on democracy and are in accordance with the procedures established by the late Premier Sun Yat-sen in 1911. Japan is spreading peace rumors in an attempt to undermine the morale of the Chinese people, and he hoped that Chinese youth would not believe them. President Sun also predicted that "after the victory of the democratic countries, China will surely become one of the world's strong countries. In the future, there will only be four strong countries in the world: China, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States. In this way, China's suffering from unequal treaties in the past 100 years will come to an end, and China will enjoy equal status in the international arena. Germany harbors the extravagant hope of conquering Britain, but does not have the strength to do so. Germany cannot gain air superiority over Britain, so it does not dare to use paratroopers against Britain. If Germany cannot gain air superiority over Britain or cross the English Channel and land in Britain by next autumn, then Germany will inevitably fail. In this way, victory in Europe will belong to Britain. Germany and Italy cannot win in Europe, and Japan cannot win in the Far East" (Associated Press dispatch from the 4th).</p>
<h3>Shen Junru et al. Letter to Stalin (Continued)</h3>
<p>Chongqing: From the beginning of the war, China has adhered to the principle of self-reliance and regards Japan as its sole enemy. China is extremely welcoming and grateful for the assistance of friendly countries, but it also expresses its disapproval and extreme patience for any actions by friendly countries that are unfavorable to China due to their temporary difficulties. We believe that our war is not only for China's independence and freedom, but also contributes to lasting world peace. We are also deeply convinced that we will be able to unite as a nation, undergo a long struggle, and achieve final victory, restoring the integrity of our country's territory and administration. We are people who advocate for war, we are also people who admire your country, and we are confident that we will continue to be people who sympathize with your country. We have boundless expectations for the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union to join hands and advance towards human liberation. Therefore, we respectfully offer a few sincere words for your consideration. Although this letter is signed by a few of us, we believe that it can represent the opinions of the vast majority of the Chinese people. We hereby extend our revolutionary greetings. Signed: Shen Junru, Wang Zaoshi, Zhang Shenfu, Zhang Naiqi, Shi Liang, Liu Qingyang, Li Gongpu, Sha Qianli, Hu Qianying (Havas dispatch from the 30th).</p>

<p>Hong Kong: From June 1st, the Hong Kong government will have exclusive rights to the import and export of rice, as part of a wartime plan. This measure was decided upon at an emergency meeting of the Executive Council yesterday. This exclusive right is linked to the agreement concluded with the Shanghai International Settlement. Shanghai will also adopt the same control. According to official announcements, due to the exorbitant price of rice, the uncertainty of future supply, and the gradual reduction in shipping, the government will assume exclusive rights to the import and export of rice (Reuters dispatch from the 4th).</p>
<p>Hong Kong: The Hong Kong government, in view of the shortage of rice and the lack of guaranteed sources, in order to solve the rice shortage and prevent the price of rice from continuing to rise, intends to implement a monopoly after the expiration of the licensing system (Telegraph from the 3rd).</p>

<p>Manila: Thirty-six US Army destroyers flew in formation over Manila and Cavite today to welcome Major General Claggett, former commander of the Selfridge Air Base in Michigan. Claggett arrived aboard a clipper to assume command of the US Air Force in the Philippines. Claggett is the first air officer to command the Philippine Air Force, and his arrival demonstrates that the US Army is actively building up the air defenses of the Philippines with new aircraft and personnel. Also on board the clipper were publisher and editor of "Time, Life, and Fortune" magazines, Mr. Luce, who grew up in China, and his wife, the famous playwright, Mrs. Brode. The Luces will travel to Hong Kong tomorrow and then proceed to Chongqing. General Claggett has been to the Philippines before. He served here as an infantry officer in 1908 and 1910 (Associated Press dispatch from the 4th).</p>
<h3>Matsuoka's Visit to the US Possible</h3>
<p>Tokyo: It is widely rumored here that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka may visit the United States. Japanese sources say that responsible officials have stated that after the signing of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, the next important diplomatic step will be to resolve outstanding issues between the United States and Japan. However, whether the timing is ripe for the Foreign Minister to visit the United States is highly questionable (Reuters dispatch from the 4th).</p>
<h3>US United China Relief Fundraising Going Very Smoothly</h3>
<p>Washington: According to Mr. Prentiss, Chairman of the United China Relief, the fundraising campaign in the United States to raise 5 million US dollars to help Chinese refugees is proceeding very smoothly.

From March 1 to April 3, a total of 148,882.25 US dollars was raised. In addition, the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China has donated 20 ambulances, medical equipment, chemicals, and sanitary supplies to China.

In March, the United States shipped military supplies to China, Greece, and the Dutch East Indies (Reuters dispatch from the 4th).</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>New Phase of the European War and the Powers</h3>
<p>The end of the Greek campaign has not brought a moment of tranquility to the world. The battle for North Africa is raging fiercely on the western border of Egypt, and a new war has broken out on the plains of Mesopotamia. These cradles of ancient human culture are now almost simultaneously suffering the baptism of modern warfare. This is a tragedy of history, but also a cold irony.</p>
<p>Whether or not the British task of defending Egypt can be carried out smoothly, the North African war is unlikely to end quickly, and the flames of war have been led to Asia. This continued expansion of the European war indicates that the Axis powers do not yet have a sure grasp of victory in their mission to conquer the heart of Britain, and therefore must seek a way out by cutting off Britain's limbs. Whether this is strategically sound or not, we will not discuss it here, but it will undoubtedly cause more innocent people to suffer the tragedy of aggressive war for no reason, and will also make it impossible for some third countries to seek neutrality and self-preservation. Although the center of the war is still in Europe, the expansion of the European war into a world war has become an irreversible fate.</p>
<p>Looking at the countries still outside the European war, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Japan have the most important role in the international situation, followed by Turkey, France, and Spain. Among these countries, although the relationships with the belligerent parties are largely determined, there is still the possibility of continued changes. Strictly speaking, only the United States has a determined position and will become more active as the situation evolves. Other countries either have treaty obligations to Britain, traditional feelings towards Germany, try to maintain neutrality, or watch the future development of events. Their attitudes cannot be regarded as absolutely unchangeable and have a considerable decisive effect on the future of the European war. Recently, Germany has launched diplomatic offensives against France, Spain, and Turkey. As it stands, although Spain is close to the Axis powers, it is unlikely to change its attitude immediately due to internal difficulties. Even if there are people like Laval and Darlan in France who advocate further merging with the Nazis, the opposition forces are no less strong. Germany's desire to seize the French fleet and Mediterranean naval bases cannot be satisfied overnight. Only Turkey is in the most difficult situation and has the most subtle attitude. In the past, signing a non-aggression pact with Bulgaria on the eve of Bulgaria's alliance with Germany and Italy, invisibly opening a path for the invasion of Greece, was already difficult to understand. Recently, it has repeatedly signed economic agreements with Axis countries while the Balkan war is in full swing, making it even more difficult to understand the basis of its foreign policy. Of course, the Soviet Union, which has always maintained neutrality, also signed an economic treaty with Germany not long ago, but Turkey, which has treaty obligations to Britain, cannot be compared to the Soviet Union. Moreover, the Axis powers are currently taking action on both sides of Turkey, forcing the Turkish authorities to express their final attitude. How Turkey will respond is a question that the whole world is closely watching. However, the extent to which France, Spain, and Turkey can affect the European war is limited to the Mediterranean to the Near East at most. In other words, it can only affect the Axis powers' strategy of dismembering Britain. As for the main struggle between Britain and Germany, in addition to the strength of both sides, it depends on the movements of the United States, the Soviet Union, and Japan.</p>
<p>The current international divisions seem to have changed since the signing of the Tripartite Pact last autumn. Previously, the United States and Japan were each aligned with Britain and Germany, and the Soviet Union, while ostensibly neutral, was more inclined towards the German side, which was relatively dominant. Now, the United States' assistance to Britain is approaching the edge of participation in the war, and Japan's support for Germany is not as active as imagined. Matsuoka's trip to Europe did not benefit relations with Germany and Italy, and his signing of a treaty with the Soviet Union clearly shows that he values relations with the Soviet Union more than the alliance with Germany and Italy. Kinoye and Matsuoka's repeated statements that the Tripartite Pact cannot be further strengthened may explain their recent psychology in general. Recently, rumors of Matsuoka's visit to the United States have been rife, and Japanese newspapers have repeatedly argued that there are no unsolvable issues between the United States and Japan. This is naturally not to say that Japan is likely to lean towards the democratic countries, but it is not an insinuation that it is unwilling to play the role of restraining the United States for Germany. Whether its intention is to bargain with Britain and the United States in order to obtain exchange conditions, or to fantasize about a solution to the "China Incident," it is only for its own sake, not to fulfill its treaty obligations. As for the Soviet Union, it is outwardly calm as usual, but it cannot completely conceal its inner anxiety. After signing a treaty with Japan, it further isolated relations between Germany and Japan by prohibiting the passage of arms. This is an expression of vigilance against Germany. It has no goodwill towards Britain and the United States, and it continues to attack them in its communiqués, but the Soviet authorities' so-called preparation to repel imperialist invaders is not aimed at Britain and the United States without cause, is it? Of course, there is no shortage of stubborn figures in Britain and the United States who are consistently anti-Soviet, but in terms of the current actual situation and foreign policy of Britain and the United States, not only is there no possibility of attacking the Soviet Union, but there is no intention to do so. Even if the Soviet side temporarily wants to conceal its defense against Germany and avoid actual conflict, lest the European war turn into the "anti-Soviet war" that the Soviet authorities fear most, it will vehemently deny any speculation about the deterioration of Soviet-German relations and add justification. But in fact, both the behavior it has shown and the strategies recently adopted by the German side show that the contradictions between the two sides are only deepening. The war in Iraq has not yet heard the Soviet Union's reaction, but even if Hitler uses the partition of the Near East as bait, the Soviet authorities may not be greedy for this small benefit and allow the continued expansion of Nazi power, would they?</p>
<p>From this it can be seen that although the Axis powers may still make progress in the Mediterranean and the Near East, the power they can rely on in the entire world has clearly shrunk. But in the democratic countries, there is no need to overemphasize these various combinations in international diplomacy, and there is no need to strive for them at any cost. What can truly control these factors is not the use of intrigue, but the strength of both sides and the progress of the war.</p>
<h3>Guo Taiqi Asks the United States to Supply China with Bombers; China's Contribution to the Democratic Countries Is Significant; US Assistance in War Materiel Will Make its War Record Even More Remarkable</h3>
<p>New York: Guo Taiqi, the newly appointed Chinese Foreign Minister, at the invitation of the Columbia Broadcasting System, gave a broadcast to the entire United States, appealing for a halt to the supply of military supplies, artillery, and aircraft to Japan, so that China could continue to fight for the preservation of democracy. He stated that China would fight until the invaders retreated. Since the military mobilization, the strength of the Chinese nation has grown stronger. Although a large part of its territory has been lost, it will not be discouraged, because China anticipated this before the war. China's war effort has made Japan pay a huge price, which is a significant contribution to British and American democracy. The reason why Singapore is still safe and sound to this day is due to China's war effort weakening Japan's strength. As for China's duty to do its utmost for the future of democracy throughout the world, it goes without saying. Today's struggle is one struggle, only the battlefields are scattered in various places. All those who believe in a free way of life will either perish together or share the blessings of independence together. There is an inseparable relationship between them. The British are admired throughout the world for their fighting spirit, but Britain still needs weapons and substantial capital and machinery for combat. Otherwise, no matter how brave the soldiers are, it is impossible to win in modern warfare. It is gratifying that the United States is providing effective assistance to Britain. However, what I must say to you is that China's current situation is no different from that of Britain. Moreover, Britain's industry is far more developed than China's, so the aid my country needs is even more urgent than that of Britain. China must have weapons for combat, must have resources, military supplies, and machinery for combat. China does not need military assistance. This is similar to the situation in Britain. China has a large population, and all of them are willing to serve the country. What China hopes for is only to provide its fighters with weapons. China is not asking China to give it gifts. After China accepts your country's assistance, it will surely repay your country's kindness. The core of the current issue is that we urgently need military supplies now. I also appeal to your country not to supply weapons to Japan, because Japan is not only China's opponent, but also America's opponent. China earnestly hopes that your country will immediately provide it with material, artillery, and aircraft to repel the Japanese. You should know that when your country supplies China with bombers, it is the day when your country prevents Japan from coveting Singapore. Singapore and the Philippines are only an arrow's flight away. China is sincerely grateful for your country's assistance. China will always rely on democracy and hopes that your country will continue to give it valuable sympathy in the future. Guo concluded by quoting the famous saying of British Prime Minister Churchill, namely, "Give China the tools, and China will complete the great task before it" (Telegraph from the 3rd).</p>
<h3>Willkie Expresses Opinion, Believes America Should Escort Convoys So War Materiel Can Safely Reach Britain, Increasingly Many Congressmen Are Making This Request</h3>
<p>Washington – Republican leader Willkie published an article in the newspaper yesterday, stating that we must transport materiel to Britain, and the government's proposed method of maritime patrols is still insufficient. With the rate of ship losses now so high, we should protect the food and war materiel being transported to Britain. If he were president, he would consult military experts on the best way to protect shipping. He absolutely supports using airplanes or other reliable methods to escort goods to Britain. According to reliable sources, Willkie has written to President Roosevelt, offering his support for any measures to ensure the safe delivery of aid to Britain. At the time of publishing this article, Willkie had already departed for South America. Judging from the Washington scene, there will be an increasing number of requests for American convoys in Congress. Senator Guffey issued this call on Thursday, and Senator Pepper will also introduce a convoy request in the Senate on Monday. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<p>Staunton, Virginia – President Roosevelt delivered a speech today in Staunton, the birthplace of former President Wilson, stating that it is always appropriate for the American people to struggle again for the survival of world democracy. The U.S. President believes that democracy will emerge victorious from today's tragedy. Only when humanity recognizes the true value of humanity can there be genuine progress. Those who completely believe in and rely on force will inevitably be destroyed by force. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<h3>British Reinforcements Arrive in Large Numbers, Iraqi War Escalates, British Troops Advance Towards Baghdad in Three Routes, Reportedly a Squad of German Air Force Flies to Syria, Iraqi Army Breaches Dike to Flood Mosul Oil Fields</h3>
<p>Berlin – The German official news agency reported that, according to sources in Rome, a total of 13,000 British and imperial troops have landed in Iraq, and other reinforcements are being transferred from outside Transjordan. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin – German radio recently broadcast a message stating that 20,000 British troops, carrying large quantities of military supplies and many tanks, have landed at the port of Basra in Iraq on the Persian Gulf. The total number of troops mobilized by the Iraqi authorities can reach 300,000. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>London – Authoritative sources here claim that British and Iraqi forces made contact yesterday in the Basra region, and the Anglo-Iraqi war has escalated. Iraqi forces were driven back by British bombers and artillery fire. Authoritative sources also stated that the rumor that [number missing] British Indian troops had surrendered is completely untrue. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Zurich – It is claimed that British troops advanced towards Baghdad yesterday in three routes, while it is believed that a squad of the German Air Force is flying to assist the Iraqi forces. According to a broadcast from Ankara radio, as of Friday evening, the British troops advancing on Baghdad had not encountered resistance. It is claimed that the British commander has ordered Baghdad to be captured at any cost. British and Iraqi forces engaged in fierce fighting at the Habbaniyah airfield, and British troops have occupied Rawabatza in northern Iraq. Ankara radio also reported that someone witnessed a squad of the German Air Force flying over the Gulf of Adalia, from the Rhodes Islands towards Syria. If this information is accurate, it indicates that German reinforcements are rushing to assist the Iraqi forces fighting the British. The radio station also reported that Iraqi radio claimed that Iraqi forces had stormed the southern part of the heavily defended Habbaniyah airfield, where British and Iraqi forces engaged in battle on Thursday. The Iraqi radio station also claimed that Iraqi forces had occupied all oil and other specialized factory equipment within Iraq. (United Press International, 4th)</p>
<p>Ankara – Last night, this radio station relayed news from the Mosul oilfields, stating that the oil region had been flooded by Iraqis breaching the dike. It is said that the oil region and its equipment are now under the jurisdiction of the Iraqi army. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London – The claim circulating from German sources that the oil pipeline from Kirkuk to Haifa, used to supply oil to the Mediterranean fleet, has been cut is not credible. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Fierce Air Battle Over Habbaniyah Airfield</p>
<p>London – A War Office communiqué stated that after hostile acts occurred in Habbaniyah on May 2nd, British forces occupied the dock area, airport, and power station of Basra, and demanded that Iraqi forces withdraw from the above areas within a specified time limit. The Iraqi senior command agreed, but after the time limit was extended, the Iraqi forces still took no action, so British forces began to drive them out with air strikes and artillery fire. According to the French official news agency, the Iraqi government issued a communiqué stating that four British and one Iraqi were injured in the Rutba area. Iraqi forces captured several transport vehicles and an oil depot in the area. On Saturday morning, Iraqi planes bombed the Habbaniyah airfield, causing heavy damage, destroying many planes parked on the ground, and causing multiple fires. The Iraqis shot down a Blenheim bomber, and also lost one plane. Later, a fierce air battle occurred over the Habbaniyah airfield, and all Iraqi planes safely returned to base. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London – According to the latest information received in London from Iraq, several British planes were destroyed on the ground, with slight casualties. The Iraqi artillery battery that shelled the British airfield at Habbaniyah was eventually destroyed by British bombers and fell silent. On Friday, Iraqi planes attempted to attack the British airfield but were unsuccessful. Yesterday morning, both sides opened fire again, and the battle is still ongoing. London has not heard anything about the Iraqi claim that it had repelled British forces in Rutba. As for the claim that British tanks were destroyed at the airfield, it is definitely not true. In the past few days, the Iraqi government has deployed troops around the British airfield in Habbaniyah, and has set up artillery positions and trenches next to the highlands overlooking the airfield. The British side requested the Iraqi side to withdraw its troops, but the Iraqi side instead increased its troops. On the morning of May 2nd, the Iraqi artillery battery began firing at the airfield. Habbaniyah is a British air force training base, so most of the planes in the field are training planes. The barracks in the field, which house the airfield staff and a small number of guards, are not fortified. Regarding the Iraqi claim that it has occupied all the oil wells and airfields in the country, it should be noted that the oil wells and airfields have always been under Iraqi control, with the only exception being the Shaiba airfield near Basra. As far as is known at present, there have been no hostile actions in the Basra area. On Friday, the British Air Force engaged Iraqi planes over Habbaniyah. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Iraqi People Still Loyal to the Royal Family, Young Officers Lean Towards Pro-German</p>
<p>London – Official circles here announced that they had received a telegram from British Ambassador Cornwall in Iraq, stating that everything is quiet in Baghdad, and although the situation is tense, no unexpected incidents have occurred. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London – The Iraqi army is divided into three groups stationed in Baghdad, Basra, and Mosul. The Iraqi soldiers attacking Habbaniyah today were sent from the Baghdad garrison. It is rumored that these people have been in contact with the Nazis. It is not yet known whether the troops stationed elsewhere have pro-German tendencies. According to Vichy sources, everything is quiet in Baghdad. The government is broadcasting orders instructing the people to immediately notify the police if they see any foreign planes or paratroopers. It is rumored that the Iraqi government has now summoned two levels of reservists. King Faisal II is at a young age and is currently living in Baghdad with his mother. Although there is unrest in the country, the people are still loyal to the royal family, and have not forgotten the love left behind by the late King Faisal I.</p>
<p>Cairo Reuters – A telegram stated that the new Iraqi government, which implemented a coup on April 1, did indeed have secret agreements with Germany and Italy. This matter was revealed when British troops arrived in Basra on April 18. However, the Iraqi army leaders all support the new Prime Minister Ali Gaylani, so there is the possibility of changes occurring in the army. When British troops arrived in Basra, Ali Gaylani followed Berlin's instructions and refused to allow the British troops to land, and sent the Baghdad garrison to gather in Habbaniyah. Thus, the conflict openly erupted. Since 1936, Iraqi soldiers have been involved in politics, and the German side has also used money to win the favor of young Iraqi officers. The coup on April 1 was carried out by these young officers. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Former Iraqi Regent Forming New Army, Preparing to Punish Traitorous Leaders</p>
<p>London – Swiss radio stated that the Iraqi Regent, Ilah, who fled to Transjordan due to the coup, is now forming a new army that will depart from Transjordan to take revenge, in order to punish Ali Gaylani's rebel party that overthrew the government. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin – The semi-official German News Agency recently issued a message stating that Britain has already organized a new Iraqi army in Transjordan, called the "National Salvation Army," commanded by Transjordanian chieftain Abdullah and former Iraqi Prime Minister Said. The British High Commissioner in the British-mandated territory of Palestine has also allocated huge sums of money for this army to use. In addition, the defenses at the border between Iraq and Transjordan have also been strengthened under British guidance. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Iraq's Important Position, Vital to the British Empire, Long Coveted by the Nazis</h3>
<p>London – This morning, newspapers presented the Nazi conspiracy behind the coup in Iraq, and the economic and military importance of Iraq. The "Daily Telegraph" stated that Iraqi Prime Minister Ali Gaylani is a pro-German element, and the coup he carried out was directed by the German side, making Britain's position in the Middle East increasingly difficult. Militarily speaking, Iraq is between Syria and Turkey, which is very important. Germany urgently needs oil, so it obviously covets these countries. Iraq is within the range of troop-carrying aircraft departing from the Dodecanese Islands. If enemy troops land from this direction, British forces will not find it difficult to deal with them, but there is a risk of the oil pipeline being sabotaged. The "Manchester Guardian" stated that Britain must hold onto Iraq, as it is the rear entrance to Turkey. If Italian troops arrive in Syria, Britain must engage them from its base in Palestine.

<h3>German Parliament Meeting Yesterday, Hitler Delivered Speech, Recounting Recent Military and Diplomatic Achievements, Shifting Blame for War to Allied Nations</h3>
<p>Berlin – Hitler delivered a speech in a special session of the German Parliament at 6:00 PM today (1:00 AM Monday Shanghai time), shifting the responsibility for the spread of the European war to the Allied nations. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin – Führer Hitler delivered a speech at the Kroll Opera House in the German Parliament at 6:00 PM this afternoon, pointing out that when the European war broke out, he had presented a report to the members of the Parliament. He continued, "I have repeatedly attempted to reach an understanding with various countries, especially Britain, in order to obtain permanently friendly cooperation. These efforts have failed due to the obstruction of a small number of people. These people firmly believe that war is inevitable, either due to jealousy or material considerations. The leader of these few people at the time was the current British Prime Minister Churchill, and the rest of his followers are the members of the current British cabinet."</p>
<p>Hitler declared that when Italy realized Greece's plot in October 1940 and launched the Italo-Greek War, Germany did not sever diplomatic relations with Greece, because it still hoped to resolve the problem in some way. However, I declared that I cannot but restore the situation in Salonika that was changed by the World War. This is the mission I bear to the world."</p>
<p>Hitler continued, "Churchill's dispatch of British troops to North Africa and the Balkans was the biggest military mistake in this war. As soon as I discovered Britain's conspiracy to establish a base in the Balkans, I immediately took measures to prevent Churchill's plan from being realized. I dare to frankly report to everyone that this measure was definitely not in the hope of dealing with Greece. At the same time, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini also never requested Germany to send a division of troops to help. Germany's dispatch of troops was not to aid Italy, but to prevent Britain's sinister designs in the Balkans."</p>
<p>Hitler continued that Britain's reckless warfare has been openly supported by the "great democracy" across the ocean. Although the people of both countries have been deeply dissatisfied with their governments' repeated failures, the government leaders in charge are stubbornly insistent, believing that only war can solve everything. Their support comes from the capital of international Jewish banking groups, stocks, and arms dealers. Hitler forcefully stated that after the end of the war in Poland, he had called for peace, which was the opinion he expressed on October 6, 1939. However, the other side deeply rejected it. After the collapse of France, he again convened the Parliament for the third time on July 19, 1940, and once again called for peace, but the result was again met with the other side's insults and nothing was achieved."</p>
<p>Hitler also declared that he believes that according to historical truth, he should distinguish the Greek people from their few corrupt leaders. These corrupt leaders, because of the King's pro-British stance, only cared about Britain's war aims and disregarded the welfare of the Greek people. "I am extremely saddened by the Greek incident, because Germans have always deeply admired Greek culture, so it is deeply regrettable to personally see this kind of development that cannot be reversed."</p>
<p>Führer Hitler announced that in the Southern Greece war, Germany captured a total of 6,298 Yugoslav officers and 337,864 soldiers, 8,000 Greek officers, and 210,000 soldiers. In addition, 9,000 British, Australian, and New Zealand officers and soldiers were captured. Hitler declared that German troops suffered a total of 57 officers and 1,042 soldiers killed, 181 officers and 3,571 soldiers wounded, and 11 officers and 372 soldiers missing in the Balkan War. The Air Force lost 10 officers and 42 airmen killed, and 36 officers and 104 soldiers missing. The German army used a total of 33 divisions in Southeast Europe. (Haitong, 4th)</p>
<h3>Axis Military Victory in the Balkans, Major Blow to Britain, Geda Writes Analysis</h3>
<p>Rome – Italian journalist Geda wrote an article today explaining that the Axis powers have gained many strategic benefits after winning in the Balkans: (1) British ships will no longer be able to enter the Adriatic Sea, (2) After German troops occupied the Greek islands in the Aegean Sea, Italy and the Italian islands in the Aegean Sea have direct communication, (3) Britain's position and labor on Malta are affected, and supply problems will become increasingly difficult, (4) In the future, the combined German and Italian forces can attack Britain's military base in Egypt from Greece, (5) In North Africa, Britain only has the Red Sea as a means of transportation and supplies, (6) In East Africa, Italian forces will wage a strong resistance against British forces, (7) The conflict between Iraqi and British forces means that British troops and military supplies must be sent elsewhere, extending the battle line.

<h3>Development of the Situation in Iraq, Germany and Turkey Closely Monitor, Turkey Deploys Troops in the Taurus Mountains</h3>
<p>London – Vichy sources stated that the German government is keeping silent about the Iraqi situation. Hungarian press reports said that political circles in Berlin did not find it strange that the Iraqi Prime Minister sought help from Berlin, because Hitler had said that Germany would attack Britain anywhere. The Germans are now paying special attention to developments in the Persian Gulf, and Rome is also paying close attention to events in Iraq. Central European newspapers under Axis control have all mentioned the unrest brewing in the Arab world. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Ankara – Political figures here are paying close attention to the situation in Iraq. Turkish newspapers believe that the Anglo-Iraqi conflict is due to different interpretations of the Anglo-Iraqi treaty, and therefore believe that compromise is still possible. (Haitong Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Lyon – Radio from the Turkish capital reported that the Turkish President is constantly seeking information on the situation in Iraq. Turkey is said to have dispatched troops and aircraft to deploy in the Taurus Mountains, where the Baghdad Railway passes. British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen and his entourage attended a tea party yesterday hosted by the Iraqi ambassador to Turkey to celebrate the Iraqi King's birthday, but the Turkish capital did not receive any news from Iraq yesterday because traffic was interrupted. What could be obtained was only the situation in Iraq reported by German radio. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>Axis Partition of Southern Territory, Part of Slovenia Incorporated into Italian Territory</h3>
<p>Rome – Official announcement, Italy will now incorporate a part of Southern Slovenia into the territory of Italy, and the remaining land, which has always been under German influence, will be merged into Germany. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Rome – Yesterday, the Italian government issued a decree stipulating the future status of a part of Southern Slovenia, incorporating it into Italian territory as the ninety-ninth province. Reliable sources say that Slovenia has a total area of 16,000 square kilometers, of which Italy obtains 10,000 square kilometers, and gains 850,000 new subjects. The capital of Slovenia, Ljubljana, has also been obtained by Italy. The part of Slovenia that belongs to Germany is mostly Styria province, where most of the German minority live. It is believed that the status of Slovenia will imitate the newly acquired Dalmatia province. Montenegro will become an appendage of the royal treasury, the same as Albania, while Croatia will become an independent country. (United Press, 4th)</p>

<h3>European War Approaches the Eastern Mediterranean, Cyprus and Palestine Hastily Complete Defense Plans, The Situation in Syria Remains Vague</h3>
<p>Cyprus – As the war gradually approaches the eastern Mediterranean, Cyprus and Palestine are now hastily completing their defenses. Cyprus is currently taking preparations to defend against air raids. The official has issued a document advising residents with no special reason to stay in the towns to quickly enter the mountains. Those who stay in the towns for business should join the air defense team. Yesterday, Nicosia sounded an alarm due to seeing a plane near the coast, but there was no air raid. Maritime aircraft, warships, and transport ships are constantly passing back and forth, which shows the gradual approach of the war. The British Navy has recently laid mines in the Mediterranean. Alexandria is also making air defense plans and is rushing to build air-raid shelters that can accommodate 100,000 people. The situation in Syria remains vague. Frenchmen and locals who have fled to this place say that Nazi "tourists" are entering one after another. The border between Syria and Palestine is now closed and guarded by soldiers. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Vichy – Authoritative figures here declared that General Dentz, the French High Commissioner in Syria and Lebanon, is trusted by the French government, and the army under his command is strong enough to cope with internal or external threats. The development of the situation in Iraq does not directly affect the interests of France. (Haitong Press, 4th)</p>
<h3>Anti-Semitism Breaks Out with Bloodshed in Palestine</h3>
<p>Beirut, Syria – A guest from the British Mandate of Palestine said that unrest is also gradually appearing in Palestine. Bloodshed has occurred in Nablus and other cities. Many Jewish leaders have been kidnapped by Arabs. The British authorities have arrested and suppressed several people. The British believe that a large number of British troops have arrived and this bloodshed will not spread elsewhere. As for the cause of the disturbances in various places, it is attributed to a large number of Jewish refugees fleeing from the Balkan Peninsula and Turkey to Palestine. (Havas, 3rd)</p>

<h3>South African Troops Participate in the Battle to Defend Egypt. British Troops Hold Firm in Tobruk. Eastern Africa Front Advances Smoothly.</h3>
<p>Cape Town: South African Prime Minister General Smuts stated yesterday in the South African Federal Parliament that South African troops, at the request of the British government, would be dispatched from Abyssinia to the western desert. A portion of the troops is already en route to Egypt. South Africa will exert all its strength in Egypt. After the British forces suffered losses in Libya, South Africa encountered unavoidable responsibilities. Fortunately, the Abyssinian campaign is nearing its end, and South African troops can be moved elsewhere. If the enemy prevails in Egypt, South Africa will be in extreme danger. The desires of the Axis powers are not limited to Europe but extend to Asia. Observing the Japanese newspapers' official announcement of peace terms a few days ago, it is evident that even Australia falls within Japan's future sphere of influence. Considering the development of this situation in the Far East and the awakening of the world's largest nation, the United States, we cannot comfort ourselves with the notion that South Africa will be spared. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Cairo: According to recent news received by well-informed sources here, a large contingent of German troops participated in the attack on the outer defenses southwest of Tobruk on Friday but failed to succeed. The battle was quite fierce at the time, but by nightfall, the positions remained largely unchanged. It is widely believed that the national forces' attempt to break through the Tobruk defenses proves that the British forces' defense of the area is causing considerable inconvenience to the enemy. A column of British mechanized forces recently conducted a swift operation to attack the Solun area, reaching the highway from Bardia to Tobruk, capturing many enemy soldiers and returning without casualties. There has also been progress in Abyssinia. The enemy positions at Amba Alagi are gradually becoming precarious. One route of British troops advancing north is now in front of Fardiyah, and although it is very close to Amba Alagi, there are no major obstacles along the way. It is estimated that there are a maximum of 30,000 enemy troops at Amba Alagi. British forces are also advancing rapidly around Fik and Chima, but due to continuous light rain, the British forces cannot increase the pressure they are applying to the enemy. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>Negotiations on Franco-German Cooperation Underway. Darlan Arrives in Paris with Reply. Rumors of France Granting Germans Access to Morocco.</h3>
<p>London: Vichy Deputy Prime Minister Darlan left Vichy yesterday for Paris to meet with German Ambassador Abetz to occupied France. Darlan's trip was a last-minute decision, so the cabinet meeting originally scheduled for yesterday afternoon has been canceled. According to Swiss radio, Abetz returned to Paris from Berlin, carrying Hitler's reply regarding cooperation proposals with Vichy. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Vichy: Yesterday, sources here claimed that the French government has agreed to allow German tourists to enter French Morocco. It is said that Germany is forcing France to regain control of French territories in Africa to show the French government's contribution to "Franco-German cooperation." Confirmed reports state that Vichy's ambassador to Paris, Brinon, has signed an agreement allowing Germans to enter Morocco. Therefore, Germans will henceforth have the same rights as British, American, and other foreigners to enter Morocco, as there was previously a ban on Germans entering Morocco. (United Press, 4th)</p>

<h3>US Plans to Build 80,000 Aircraft for Britain and the United States. Expected Production to Exceed Germany's.</h3>
<p>Washington: U.S. defense officials are currently determining the number of aircraft to be produced, aiming to produce 80,000 aircraft for the U.S. and Britain by mid-1943. However, this number includes the 33,000 aircraft currently on order. This news was revealed shortly before President Roosevelt signed the $7,000,000,000 aid bill. The debate over the issue of fully assisting Britain has not yet subsided due to the question of whether U.S. escorts are possible. Missouri Democratic Senator Clark criticized this issue, saying that Roosevelt's administration has ordered U.S. shipyards to repair ships for belligerent countries, causing the clouds of war to spread along the U.S. coast. He feared that the second step would be to request U.S. naval escorts, and the third would be for the U.S. to send expeditionary forces abroad. These developments are progressing very rapidly. However, Florida Democratic Senator Pepper doubted that the escort issue would become a reality quickly. He believed that no matter how much Hitler threatened, U.S. supplies would eventually reach Britain. Officials stated that the 80,000 aircraft production program would clearly facilitate aircraft production and expand it further. Of the 33,000 aircraft currently on order, 19,000 are for the U.S., and 14,000 are for Britain. The Lend-Lease Act also includes funds to build 10,000 aircraft for Britain. National Defense Production Leader Knudsen believed that once this aircraft production program begins, U.S. aircraft production will be many times greater than Germany's current production and stated that this program could be completed by mid-1942. Furthermore, well-informed defense officials revealed that Britain's original request for military assistance totaled approximately $15,000,000,000. After being told that the U.S. could not add such a massive program to its current defense program, Britain agreed to reduce its request to $9,000,000,000. Defense officials further reduced it to $7,000,000,000, which was submitted to Congress. Other facts regarding aid to Britain include: (1) Stettinius, Director of the Priority Department of the Production Management Office, allowed Britain to transport 200 tons of manganese, which Britain had ordered before the aid bill was passed. (2) Secretary of Agriculture Wickard told the Senate Agriculture Committee that the food needed by Britain was being investigated and argued that all non-bulky foods, such as dried fruits, eggs, cheese, and condensed milk, could be included in the aid list. (3) It is expected here that British aviation expert Sherard will soon begin transferring U.S. merchant ships to Britain. The Production Management Office announced that direct defense expenditures in the accounts of the U.S. and Britain, including approved and proposed expenditures, have reached $32,688,800,000. Of this, $22,991,260,000 has been approved and allocated, and $9,265,200,000 is listed in the 1942 budget and has now been submitted to Congress. In the first nine and a half months of the current fiscal year, the Treasury Department's total defense expenditures amounted to $3,452,000,000. The current monthly expenditure is approximately $600,000,000. Defense economists estimate that the cash defense expenditures for the current fiscal year ending in June will be $6,000,000,000. According to these economists, this figure is far lower than the figure for the second year when aid to democratic countries and the reorganization of our own military will be implemented, and they say that the amount needed for defense and aid to foreign countries will be at least $20,000,000,000. However, these people warned that this amount of funds cannot be achieved unless the nation's production facilities, from raw materials to basic defense industries, are further expanded, and raw materials are one of the biggest problems. These people also predicted that unless this expansion can guarantee sufficient supply, many industries that meet the needs of the people will be closed or greatly reduced in operation.

<h3>US Monitoring Near East Situation. Sends Military Observers to Iraq and Iran.</h3>
<p>Washington: Several U.S. Army officers have been ordered to the capitals of Iraq and Iran as military observers. Another officer has been sent to Ankara to perform the same duties. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>British Warships Intercept Enemy Ships, Using International Signals.</h3>
<p>London: The British Navy yesterday instructed British radio stations everywhere to broadcast the British warning to enemy ships around the world, stating that British warships will henceforth issue the WBA international signal to enemy ships, which means "Stop, do not lower lifeboats, do not scuttle, do not use wireless telegraphy, or we will open fire." (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>US Atlantic Patrols Ordered Not to Open Fire. Should Only Broadcast German Ship Activities to British Navy.</h3>
<p>Washington: Yesterday, well-informed sources here stated that U.S. Atlantic patrols have been ordered to "try to avoid opening fire unless sunk." These patrols are reportedly operating within 1,500 miles of British west coast ports and have been ordered to detect Axis surface vessels, submarines, and aircraft and broadcast their location to the British, maintaining contact until British forces arrive. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Navy Department Denies Using Warships as Escorts</p>
<p>Washington: The U.S. Navy Department issued a formal statement yesterday denying that U.S. warships are being used as escorts. When asked about reports that several U.S. warships, carrying large quantities of military supplies, had sailed into the Suez Canal to deliver them to Britain, the department issued the following statement: "No U.S. warships have been assigned to escort duty." At the same time, the U.S. Department of Commerce has not heard any news, but stated that the department does not have detailed information on the movements of every ship. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington: Sources in the shipping industry here believe that reports of U.S. ships carrying war materiel arriving at the Suez Canal are likely true, as it was heard that in early April, when President Roosevelt announced that the Red Sea was not a war zone, cargo ships were fully loaded with war materiel to supply Greece and China and sailed from the U.S. Officials stated that although Greece and China have failed, the war materiel is still being transported to Europe. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>26 US Ships Arrive at Suez</p>
<p>New York: According to British radio news received today by the Columbia Broadcasting System, 26 U.S. merchant ships carrying war supplies for Britain have arrived at the Suez Canal. The arrival of these ships at the Suez Canal is in accordance with President Roosevelt's established policy, as the President stated that U.S. ships can now sail into war zones previously prohibited.

<h3>Japanese Foreign Policy to Undergo Changes. Japan's Greatest Concern is US Attitude.</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Japan News predicted yesterday that after Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka returned from visiting the Grand Shrine on Monday evening, Japan's foreign policy will become more proactive. Matsuoka reported the results of his European tour to the Sun Goddess at the Grand Shrine last night. It is expected that the Thai-Vietnamese peace treaty negotiated by Japan will be formally signed this week, and the two signatory countries will formally guarantee not to conclude any agreements that are detrimental to Japan. This guarantee will ensure Japan's dominant position in East Asia. The Asahi Shimbun also stated that the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact is a prelude to the conclusion of a basic fisheries treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union and will help Japan's position in East Asia. Therefore, Japan's only remaining problem is related to the United States. The United States has expressed very serious concerns about Japan's southward advance policy. Japan must ascertain the attitude of the United States. How Japan will proceed in this regard will naturally depend on the future development of the international situation. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<h3>Hundreds of German Aircraft Attack Liverpool. Drop High-Explosive Bombs, Causing Significant Damage.</h3>
<p>Berlin: Today's German military report stated that last night, hundreds of German aircraft heavily bombed the key British port of Liverpool for several hours, with the sky illuminated by flames. Docks and warehouses suffered heavy losses. Several port facilities and airfields on the east coast of England were also bombed. Enemy aircraft attacked cities in western Germany last night, dropping few bombs. There was no damage to military facilities, and only a few civilians were killed or injured. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>London: Less than an hour after the British Air Force heavily bombed German-occupied areas on the French coast, German aircraft launched their third consecutive night raid on the Liverpool area this morning. German aircraft also bombed a certain town in the southeast. British aircraft shot down a total of eleven German aircraft, setting a new record. When German aircraft passed over London heading northwest, the London alarm sounded loudly, but by dawn, the alarm had been lifted. Flares were dropped in the suburbs of London, but no bombs fell. The communiqué stated that German aircraft used new lightning tactics during the air raid on Liverpool, dropping a large number of various types of high-explosive bombs without first dropping flares and incendiary bombs. Many houses and buildings were destroyed, and there were casualties. The German aircraft in the south continued to use their usual fire-attack lightning warfare tactics. An air-raid shelter in a certain town on the northeast coast was destroyed, killing or injuring several people. (International, 4th)</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts on the European War (V) (X): The New Type of American Diplomat.</h3>
<p>When the manager of his dairy reported that a hospital in Concord owed $1,500 for milk, he simply paid the bill himself. One cold morning, he learned that many vagrants had been released from the police station without breakfast, and knowing that there were no public funds available to provide this breakfast, he took it upon himself to buy everything. He continued this charitable act for several years.</p>
<p>In New York, he once spent an entire day looking for work for a girl. He did not know this girl, but because her friends in Concord made an appeal, Winant did not hesitate to travel around and do his best to find her a job. In Washington, one afternoon he went out to attend a friend's wedding. Unexpectedly, the car he was in took a long detour, and by the time he arrived at the church door, the wedding ceremony was over. Winant, fearing that they would be upset knowing that he had missed the wedding, shrank back into the car.</p>
<p>He now serves as the ambassador to Britain and will be a reporter for the US President and the State Department. In normal times, he would attend many grand events, give many speeches, and be welcomed everywhere, partly because he is the representative of a great power and partly because he is indeed a figure of considerable reputation. But in wartime, his work is much more important and also very different in nature. Banquets are rare, and in a Britain under blackout and rationing, the extravagance of the past is no longer appropriate today. His social interactions will be reduced to a minimum, which is very suitable for Winant, who does not pay much attention to social life.</p>
<p>In the embassy in Grosvenor Square, he is like a military observer on the front lines. He faces the same threat of air raids as all Londoners. He is a source of all news, and he must report to the US government on all aspects of air defense progress, social tensions, and the transformations of the British people, especially British workers, under this unprecedented test.</p>
<p>In Geneva, he worked hard to maintain European peace and, in a turbulent world, sought to preserve the spirit of free investigation and democratic thought of the International Labor Office. When Germany occupied the Sudetenland, he flew to Prague, Czechoslovakia, to express the sympathy of people with democratic ideas. When German bombs first fell on the outskirts of Paris, he worked behind the scenes to promote a compromise between Prime Minister Daladier and the labor world.</p>
<p>He has seen haggard and frightened refugees and disorganized retreating armies. His passion for these victims of war has therefore grown even more intense. When Switzerland was isolated from the outside world, he wanted to move the International Labor Office to the United States but failed and had to move it to Montreal, Canada.</p>
<p>The London of today, the Britain of today, is very different from what previous ambassadors knew. The new ambassador should pay more attention to the British Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Health, and all public and private institutions responsible for evacuating the population, distributing food, and various social welfare undertakings than other ambassadors. Winant is shouldering many more important duties, not just deciding what kind of clothes to wear when being received.</p>
<p>Some Americans are afraid that Britain has changed too much or has been forced into socialism and are therefore anxious. They suggest that the United States should not share weal and woe with Britain until it is certain what Britain will become. President Roosevelt's dispatch of Winant is not to instruct Britain on the direction it should take, but it is clear that he wants to obtain information at any time on the major reforms taking place in British society.</p>
<p>When the war is over and the future of the world is being considered, this situation may be very important for the United States; in this world, the role of the United States seems to be even greater than in the past. That is why she has chosen such a new person to be the ambassador to Britain!</p>

<h3>Anniversary of the Establishment of the Revolutionary Government. The Whole City Celebrates by Displaying National Flags. Adhering to the Spirit of the Founding Father and Continuing Efforts. Firm Belief Under the Leadership of the President.</h3>
<p>Today is the "Double Fifth" Festival, commemorating the day when the Founding Father, Sun Yat-sen, took office as the Extraordinary President and established the Revolutionary Government. Due to the special circumstances, people in all circles of this city do not hold any ceremonies. However, to pay tribute to the great revolutionary spirit of the Founding Father, in accordance with the agreement with the concession authorities, the entire city will uniformly display the national flag to commemorate the occasion and participate in the anti-Japanese construction work with ardent patriotic sentiments. Furthermore, in view of the significance of the "Double Fifth," the difficulty of promoting the revolution, and the difficulty of realizing the Three Principles of the People, we are even more impressed by the greatness of the Founding Father's uncompromising and fearless spirit and have a more firm belief in the Three Principles of the People created by the Founding Father. Therefore, citizens from all walks of life are determined to follow the spirit of the Founding Father, adhere to the anti-Japanese construction belief under the leadership of the President, so as to recover the lost territories and obtain freedom and liberation as soon as possible, to fulfill the duties that citizens should fulfill, and to comfort the spirit of the Founding Father in heaven.</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Implement Alert</p>
<p>Since the arrival of the eventful May, the two concession authorities have jointly implemented alerts to prevent unscrupulous elements from taking the opportunity to make trouble. As today is the anniversary of the Nationalist Party President's assumption of the Extraordinary Presidency, it is deeply feared that thugs will cause trouble and disrupt public order. Therefore, in order to maintain order within the concession, the alert work has been intensified. A large number of police officers were dispatched to patrol various places, and the search of passing pedestrians was very strict.</p>
<p>French Consular Office Closed for One Day</p>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the founding of the National Government, and the various schools in this city will follow the usual practice of celebrating with a holiday. The French Consulate in Shanghai and the various police stations under the French Municipal Council will also be closed for the French national holiday, so they will also be closed for one day.</p>
<h3>Mother's Day. Women's Circles Publish a Message to Fellow Women.</h3>
<p>May 8th is International Mother's Day. Women's organizations in this city, in view of the importance of maternal education to life, and in this period of anti-Japanese construction and the difficult autumn of the nation, the family education of children is paramount. Only with good maternal education can there be excellent citizens, who can later bear the burdens of serving the country and the nation. Due to the special circumstances, the celebration ceremony was suspended. A message to fellow women was specially published to encourage fellow women in the city to recognize their responsibilities and the times and to be modern virtuous mothers and good wives. The original text roughly stated that educating children is not only for the tradition of one's own family, but it must be known that the children of today are the masters of the country in the future. Mothers should recognize the meaning of raising and educating children. Although there is an old saying, "It is the father's fault if they are raised but not taught, and the teacher's laziness if the teaching is not strict." It must be known that this is entirely the corrupt language of feudal times that despised women's rights. In this era, men and women stand on the same footing. Don't you see that the boundaries between men and women have reached an equal state? So we cannot shirk our responsibilities, and we cannot despise ourselves. Overthrow feudal thoughts. Our slogan is that everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country. We must work hard for the country, correct unreasonable traditional concepts, cultivate modern maternal love that is needed, eradicate family thoughts, and earnestly shoulder the responsibility of raising and educating children for the country, for the nation, for society, and for mankind. Strictly discipline them, so as to cultivate promising young people, win freedom and glory for the country and society, and seek liberation and survival for the nation and the people.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Was Youth Day. Spirits Were Uplifted. Continue to Promote the Spirit of the May Fourth Movement and Complete the Great Cause of National Rejuvenation.</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, which is also Chinese Youth Day. Although the youth, education, and cultural circles in Shanghai could not hold a commemorative ceremony due to the special circumstances, the celebratory mood was exceptionally high. In order to continue to promote the spirit of the "May Fourth" Movement, the youth circles of the entire city resolutely support the national policy, concentrate their will and strength, work hard and forge ahead under the leadership of the most appropriate authorities = to complete the great cause of national rejuvenation.</p>
<h3>Condolences to the Lone Army Camp. Number of People Restricted.</h3>
<p>The memorial service for Commander Xie of the Lone Army Camp, which was postponed from the first day, was originally scheduled to determine the date yesterday morning. However, yesterday was Sunday, and the personnel of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department and Lei Tuanfu were unable to meet. It is understood that this morning, the person in charge of the Lone Army Camp will submit the meeting date to the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department. After the agreement, it can be decided. Also, yesterday the Police Department issued a written notice, stipulating that during the period from the day of the burial until the performance of the ceremony, the number of visitors is restricted. However, those who are queuing to present wreaths and couplets are allowed to enter, but the exact number must not exceed one hundred people each time. After receiving this notice, the Lone Army Camp believed that this restriction method was not satisfactory in many respects. Therefore, after a long discussion yesterday, they will propose improvement measures to the Police Department today, so that order, security, and the feelings of the Lone Army and the outside world can be taken care of at the same time. Yesterday, the two barbed wire fences at the intersection of Singapore Road and Haifang Road and the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Changping Road have been removed. The area around the Lone Army Camp has returned to its original state. People from all walks of life continue to send wreaths, couplets, and condolences. According to statistics, the condolences and donations for casting bronze statues received in the past two days amounted to more than 2,000 yuan. Yesterday, a sacrificial table was set up in front of Commander Xie's spirit, with a pumpkin engraved with elegiac words such as "His appearance and voice are still present," which was extremely exquisite. Also, two memorial archways have been built, which are very spectacular. After the date of the memorial service is determined, all preparatory matters will be actively carried out.</p>
<h3>No Restrictions on Sales of Hong Kong Rice; Free Purchase Permitted; Those Reselling for Profit Will Be Prosecuted; Rice Shops Must Not Adulterate or Shortchange</h3>
<p>Since the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession decided to directly order from foreign rice-producing areas and transport to Shanghai for flat-rate sales to thoroughly stabilize the food supply of the city's residents, the news spread, and although some rice merchants wanted to maintain high prices to satisfy their selfish desires, they have already been broken by the sluggish market. In addition, the measures taken by the Rice Market Management Committee to prevent speculation have also been effective. Yesterday, according to a member of the management committee, the committee will continue to</p>
<p>Prevent Speculation</p>
<p>Measures will continue to be implemented, and those in the industry who violate these measures will be severely sanctioned. Furthermore, according to someone familiar with the rice market, before the war, a rise of more than ten cents per shi (unit of dry measure) was considered extraordinary, but now the price rises by five or six yuan each time, and the price changes several times a day. The volatility is even worse than speculation on the stock exchange. While some in the industry profit, the greatest profits are made by those who own large amounts of idle capital and hoard huge quantities of rice. It is estimated that of the 1.1 million bags of rice hoarded in the city's warehouses, at least 900,000 bags are controlled by a few large hoarders. The price of rice per shi is at most around 90 yuan, but this time, under the pretext of the tense situation in Southeast Asia, it was wildly raised to 156 yuan per shi. The large hoarders may have thought that the 900,000 bags of rice they hoarded could instantly yield a profit of 50 to 60 million yuan. Unexpectedly, the authorities of the two concessions, seeing the increasingly serious food problem, took the current measures, giving the rice merchants a severe blow. Therefore, the city's food supply can be</p>
<p>Thoroughly Stabilized</p>
<p>And ordinary people can obtain rice at a reasonable price. Furthermore, according to reporters, since the Public Concession announced yesterday that it would sell inexpensive Hong Kong rice to dealers at 122 yuan and 91 cents per bag, and the dealers would sell it to rice shops at 130 yuan and 50 cents, with a profit of more than ten yuan per bag, rice dealers have been enthusiastically agreeing and placing orders. In order to prevent unscrupulous citizens from purchasing cheap rice for hoarding or reselling for profit, the two authorities will make regulations when selling it. As for the detailed methods, they are still being discussed. However, the purpose of the authorities' purchase of cheap rice is to regulate the food supply and suppress rice prices. Therefore, they will</p>
<p>Permit Free Purchase</p>
<p>For citizens to purchase this cheap rice. Considering that in the past, rice shops or rice merchants were stolen from and adulterated with impurities by unscrupulous rice merchants, which citizens have repeatedly reported, in order to plan ahead and genuinely benefit the common people, the authorities will order people to go to the rice shops or rice merchants to closely monitor</p>
<h3>Broadcast to China, Call Sign KGRI, Wavelength 31.26</h3>
<p>The shortwave radio station of the American General Electric Company, in order to promote goodwill towards China, publicize Sino-American culture, and communicate news to overseas Chinese in China, has decided to broadcast to the coasts of China and Shanghai. The radio station began broadcasting from San Francisco on the 19th of last month. Shanghai can listen at 5 pm daily, summer time, but although it has been reported in the newspapers, there are still cases where it cannot be heard. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from related parties that the call sign of the General Electric Radio Station is KGRI, a shortwave radio station with a wavelength of 31.0 meters and a frequency of 9630. San Francisco's broadcast time is midnight to 1 am as the standard. The listening times in other parts of China are: Chongqing 3 pm, Kunming 2:45 pm, Chengdu 2:50 pm, Hong Kong 3:30 pm. The daily broadcast programs include international news, Chinese news, celebrity speeches, music, opera, and the fundraising work of overseas Chinese for national salvation in various places, broadcast in Mandarin, Cantonese, and English. The radio station has a power of 50,000 watts, and its broadcasting range covers North and South America, China, Vietnam, Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, Australia, and Hawaii.</p>
<h3>Hoping Shanghai Medical Personnel will Voluntarily Serve in the Interior; Red Cross Work is Active but Manpower is Extremely Lacking; Shanghai Medical Talents are Concentrated and Almost Redundant</h3>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that yesterday a reporter met with a person in charge who came to Shanghai from the interior to discuss sending doctors to serve in Free China. They discussed the current development of rescue work in the interior and the urgent needs. According to reports, since the four years of war, rescue work has become increasingly heavy, so the number of medical personnel needed must be greatly increased. Today, the interior needs 300,000 medical talents, of which there should be 30,000 physicians, but statistics show that there are only 6,000 physicians currently serving, far short of the number needed. Therefore, the lack of medical personnel is the biggest difficulty in the interior's rescue efforts. Other issues such as the supply of medical equipment and the dilapidated transportation are also hindering the progress of the work. This is urgently hoped for</p>
<p>National Compatriots</p>
<p>And enthusiastic support and generous donations from overseas Chinese. Taking the work of the Chinese Red Cross as an example, the Red Cross has its headquarters in Guiyang and has more than 100 rescue teams. Each rescue team is composed of one doctor, two female nurses, four assistants, and ten stretcher bearers. The work is very active, but there are only 176 doctors, so it is difficult to develop the work on a large scale. However, there is still a shortage of various medicines, especially quinine, so it is hoped that enthusiastic people at home and abroad will</p>
<p>Provide a Steady Supply</p>
<p>To meet the needs. Transportation is also being improved. In the past four years, the Red Cross transport vehicles have traveled more than 4 million kilometers, injected more than 11 million doses of cholera vaccine, performed more than 42,000 surgical operations, and bandaged more than 3.8 million injuries. In addition to the 176 doctors, there are also 444 female nurses, 1,081 surgical assistants, and about 20 foreign doctors, all of whom came to China out of righteous indignation. They work hard and live a difficult life, but they have no complaints</p>
<p>Truly Admirable</p>
<p>Furthermore, the drugs currently needed by the Red Cross organization cost about US$300,000 per month. If they can be used, these large quantities of drugs, in terms of transportation, require 175 transport vehicles, which must travel 300,000 kilometers per month. The gasoline and repair costs required also amount to US$370,000 per month. In total, the Red Cross needs about US$700,000 per month. This responsibility, in addition to the US Red Cross's regular supply of medicines imported via the Burma Road, must be shouldered by the Chinese people with</p>
<p>Major Responsibility</p>
<p>This time, I have traveled all over Free China to Shanghai, hoping that Shanghai people will have a deep impression of the rescue work in the interior, and earnestly hope that the 4 million people in Shanghai will not ignore this sacred responsibility. Shanghai is a district where medical talents are concentrated, and there is almost a surplus. Therefore, I am very willing to make an earnest appeal with sincere enthusiasm, hoping that Shanghai's medical personnel will voluntarily serve in the interior.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Eastern Telegraph Bureau Moves to Lishui; Japanese Troops Spying on Shangyu Retreat to Yuyao; Chinese Troops in Wenzhou Move to Defend the Suburbs</h3>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency, reporters learned from Shanghai groups in Zhejiang Province that the battle situation in eastern Zhejiang is as follows: (1) Japanese troops in the petroleum industry have invaded Xiangshan, and the county seat has fallen on the 30th.

<h3>Reduce Horn Noise</h3>
<p>The Times reports that the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council launched a campaign to reduce the noise of car horns on the 19th of this month. The local American-owned Mayo Automobile Company has decided to cooperate with the Police Department and has specially made nine types of horns with different tones and sizes. The sound can be reduced in two ways. They are made in accordance with the methods already explained by the Police Department to automobile dealers and automobile repair shops. These automobile dealers and repairers are also willing to cooperate with the authorities to install sound-reducing horns for customers free of charge.</p>
<h3>Measures Shanghai Factories Should Take; Seek Security First, Then Move Inland; Minister Weng Promises Assistance</h3>
<p>The China National Industry and Commerce Service Agency held a symposium in Hong Kong on the measures that Chinese-owned factories in the two special zones of Shanghai should take. More than ten people including Lin Kanghou, Pan Yangyao, Xu Zhiyi, Huang Boqiao, Zhou Yongneng, and Jia Shishi attended. First, Lin Kanghou reported the purpose of the event, and then everyone present expressed their opinions as much as possible. The conclusion was that Chinese-owned factories in the two special zones of Shanghai should first seek security measures and then move inland in a planned manner according to the needs of the rear. The agency also compiled opinions and presented them to Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao, who promised to assist and guide with the government's strength.</p>
<h3>Cleaning Workers in the French Concession Relapse into Strike; Conflict Occurs Between Workers; White Russian Workers Replace Jobs</h3>
<p>The cleaning workers of the French Municipal Council resumed work after the labor unrest subsided some days ago. Unexpectedly, the bureau's deduction of wages during the strike period aroused dissatisfaction among the workers. On the morning of the third day (the 3rd), a serious dispute arose again when the Municipal Council issued wages. As a result, the police arrested six workers including Li Guizhen, Chen Xuede, and Chen Hengpei, and then released them. This made the workers even more dissatisfied, but by the afternoon of the previous day, the situation had already eased, and most of the workers were willing to have the wages deducted for the days of the strike and took the wages that were distributed. However, there was still a small part that insisted on opposing it and attempted to go on strike again, but it was prevented by the strict vigilance of the police. Until yesterday morning, the workers were still serving as usual. Unexpectedly, some of the workers who advocated for a strike again the previous day proposed a strike, demanding that the wages during the strike period should not be reduced and should be paid in full. They also accused the working workers of not cooperating. As a result, the opinions differed between the workers, and a verbal argument broke out. Then, a physical conflict occurred in the workshop on Taurfirth Road. For a time, they fought each other, and the situation was serious. After receiving the news, the French police immediately dispatched a large team of police officers to maintain order, sent five injured workers to Guangci Hospital for treatment, and arrested many of the workers who caused the incident. Afterwards, the working workers also dispersed one after another, causing work to stop again. However, the garbage removal work yesterday morning was not hindered because the dispute occurred later than the removal. However, the cleaning work in the afternoon, the Municipal Council has</p>
<p>Workers Relapsed into Strikes, Still Replaced by White Russian Workers</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Special Police Demand Equal Treatment; More Than 600 People Made a Major Demand; Pan Da Promised a Reply Within Three Days</h3>
<p>The News Agency reports that the Shanghai West Special Police demanding a salary increase, which has been brewing lately, had rumors yesterday that all police officers would go on strike. It is learned that the strike did not happen. Since its establishment, of the 880 special police officers, 200 were assigned by the Public Concession Police Department. The monthly salary for each person is 165 yuan, including subsidies. The monthly salary for each of the others is only 15 yuan. With the cost of living so high and the price of rice and firewood so expensive, such a small amount is not enough to maintain the minimum standard of living. Therefore, these people</p>
<p>Demand a Salary Increase and Equal Treatment for All. After brewing for so long, there has been no result, so there was once a rumor that they would go on strike from yesterday morning. However, according to reporters from the News Agency, yesterday morning, more than 600 people petitioned Pan Da, demanding a definite reply. Pan agreed to find ways to improve the treatment and give a formal reply within three days, so there was no strike.</p>
<h3>Commercial Press Labor Dispute Approaching Resolution</h3>
<p>Since the Hong Kong General Office sent Associate Lee Pe-Chia and others to Shanghai to mediate the labor dispute at the Commercial Press, representatives from both labor and management have held several negotiations, and the situation is still good. It is expected to be completely resolved in the short term. As for the salary for the second half of April for the colleagues, the library has decided to issue it on May 5 (today) from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm. There has been an announcement.</p>
<p>Dyers' Wine Money</p>
<p>More than 3,000 dyers and workers, feeling that everything is expensive and life is difficult, jointly asked the factory to increase the wine money. It is found that according to the customary practice, about six corners of wine money are taken for each piece of dyed silk. It is learned that the factory has already accepted the consideration and will appropriately increase it. It has now been decided to increase the dyeing fee to the customer gang, which should not cause a labor dispute.</p>
<p>Transfer Workers' Strike</p>
<p>All the drivers and workers of the Miller Transfer Company on Beijing Road, because the cost of living in Shanghai is high and the price of rice is rising, are unable to make a living. As a last resort, they asked the employer on April 20 to improve their treatment, but were rejected. On April 29, a strike occurred. The employer then issued a notice stating that from now on, all drivers and workers would be dismissed and asked to go to the company to calculate and pay their wages. There was no room for negotiation. All the drivers and workers of Maotaiheng, Maoruifeng, and Huafu and other transportation companies were even more angry. They held a general meeting at No. 21, Jinjia Lane, at the end of Xinzha Road on the 2nd and decided to organize the Shanghai Drivers and Workers Comrades Support Association to respond to the Miller workers.</p>
<h3>New Pu Yu Hall Donations Pour In</h3>

<h3>Chinese Troops Recapture Wenzhou Haimen Japanese Side Already Acknowledges</h3>
<p>Since Japanese troops landed in Ningbo, Wenzhou, Haimen and other places along the coast of eastern Zhejiang last month and invaded Linhai and Huangyan counties, they once claimed that this move was to "relieve the people's suffering" and intended to "continue to deepen into the ground." However, after Chinese troops reinforced their counterattack, they recovered Linhai and Huangyan on the 25th of last month, Wenzhou on the 2nd of this month, and Haimen on the 3rd, causing serious blows to the Japanese troops invading the Wenzhou and Taizhou prefectures. They had no choice but to retreat. Currently, the Japanese side has also acknowledged that Wenzhou Taizhou (i.e. Linhai) Haimen and other places have been recaptured by Chinese troops, but they falsely claim that they have already "completed their combat objectives," so they "advanced to other directions" on the first day, and also said that "the troops landing in the Haimen and Wenzhou areas, because there is no need to be stationed for a long time, so they are transferred to other areas." The Japanese Army Reporting Department and the Navy Reporting Department released this news on the day after the Chinese army recovered Wenzhou (i.e. the 3rd).</p>
<h3>Shanghai in the Eyes of Foreigners</h3>
<p>— (Tao)</p>
<p>Two or three months ago, I was dreaming day and night about my hometown, Shanghai. A European friend who was expelled by the Franco-German armistice agreement escaped to Shanghai via Vietnam. Not long after arriving in Shanghai, he sent me a letter describing Shanghai in his eyes. I was very moved after reading it. Before long, I myself returned to this hometown. Reading this letter again, I still feel a little emotional, so I translated it for my fellow villagers to see:</p>
<p>Dear Antron:</p>
<p>In this stormy environment of blazing fire, I was fortunate enough to safely arrive in your lovely hometown, Shanghai, this metropolis of the Far East. To a newcomer like me, it is indeed very lively and prosperous, no less than Paris, Berlin, or Vienna in Europe. Especially in this world where gunfire and bombs are intertwined, Shanghai can still use pure human songs to replace it. It's really worth savoring and intoxicating! When I first arrived here, I really didn't know how to spend the money in my pocket. There are tall and complete department stores, dance halls with good music and beautiful decorations, large hotels, restaurants, movie theaters, casinos, and all kinds of comfortable entertainment venues. I never imagined that the other side of the Atlantic Ocean is still so quiet and peaceful!</p>
<p>Many people say, "Shanghai is not a Chinese city." I have this feeling after coming here. Like many white colonial areas, Shanghai is currently managed by foreigners, and Chinese people only work under the command of managers. Many privileged foreigners have built pretty villas and mansions here. They have accumulated a lot of wealth on this fertile land of China. There are also many wealthy and wealthy Chinese, but most of them like to associate with foreigners, like the Annam wealthy people in Vietnam. It seems that they have peeled off a layer of their yellow skin, and they have long suspected what nationality they are! Don't be sad when you read it.</p>
<p>There are many Chinese people who speak fluent foreign languages. They look down on their compatriots. When I first saw them, I suspected that they were Filipinos or Annam Burmese!</p>
<p>I know that twenty-four years ago, Shanghai was also a battlefield like the Paris battlefield, but after coming here, I couldn't find any traces of the war. Many people's words and actions do not show any signs of defending what happened three or four years ago! I also know that the Sino-Japanese war is still going on, but after arriving in Shanghai, if the newspaper doesn't carry this kind of news, I almost don't believe that there is still this war!</p>
<p>Friends told me, "Shanghai is more prosperous than before!" I think this is a matter of course. In Shanghai, the British and German Italians who can only meet on the battlefield are neighbors here. Maybe the people of the opposing countries still have the opportunity to work together. There are also many white Russians and Jews who cannot stand in other countries, and can live and work here in peace and contentment! I have always been afraid to say which country's territory this is, and I have always been afraid to recognize this strange metropolis!</p>
<p>It is said that there are many entertainment venues in Shanghai, but that is not entirely true. You probably understand the urban area included in Shanghai. In addition to a few very small parks and a racecourse in the concession, residents can only entertain themselves under the electric lights! After coming here, I rarely heard people talk about hunting, swimming at the beach, picnics in the suburbs, or traveling. Some people say that Shanghai is now a happy and prosperous "isolated island." I think this is indeed a meaningful name. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Shortage of Goods in Japan's Mainland Reduces Trade with China; Orders All Prefectures to Close Shanghai Branch Offices by Mid-May</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun, the Japanese side recently decided to "strengthen the adjustment of trade," focusing on Shanghai, to adjust the business operators engaged in trade with China, and ordered the "performance operators" of the third class and below to temporarily suspend operations, and decided to order the "branch offices" dispatched by each prefecture to Shanghai to close down, sort out the remaining affairs, and complete it by mid-May. This "closure problem" was decided in late August last year, and now it is only being made public. As for this "strengthening" purpose, it is actually (1) to prevent the export of goods from the mainland when there is a shortage of goods in the mainland, and (2) to prevent these goods from flowing into aid to China through the hands of third-country people. There is no other capital background. As for the permit system for first- and second-class traders, it will also be reduced as appropriate, and the "branch offices" of the third class and below will be withdrawn from various places. The "trade cadre offices" in Tokyo, Kobe, Osaka, Yokohama and other major cities will be retained. Most of the staff of all the withdrawn "branch offices" will be transferred to other positions or join other companies, so there are no problems in terms of personnel.</p>
<h3>Young Man Squanders Money on Prostitution and Gambling; Falsely Reports Kidnapping; Results in All Being Detained</h3>
<p>Huang Bingkun (18 years old), a young man from Chongming who lives at No. 67, Singapore Road, has recently become acquainted with local people Xu Youqing (20 years old), Yang Xingen (21 years old) from Nanxun, and Ying Lixing (25 years old) from Ningbo, due to prostitution and gambling. They gambled in rooms in hotels such as Anshang on Bali Bridge Road, Minxin and Weier Meng on Edward Road, and Donghe on Huagenei Road, inviting guides and prostitutes to accompany them for fun for two weeks. The 600 yuan in legal tender brought by Huang and Xu was exhausted, and it was difficult to return. Therefore, after mutual consultation, Huang Bingkun first went home and falsely told his parents that at 9:00 am on April 22, he was robbed of a pistol by a group of thugs at a certain place on North Henan Road and kidnapped to a certain place in Hongkou, demanding more than 1,000 yuan. Now the gang is hiding in a certain hotel in the French Concession. Huang Bingkun's parents secretly reported the situation to the Hui Division Police Department, and dispatched Chinese Chief Detective Feng Baishun, Deputy Chief Detective Huang Fuson, and Liang Yuliang, together with Western detectives, to Room 92 of the Donghe Hotel on Huagenei Road in the French Concession, and brought back Xu Youqing, Yang Xingen, Ying Lixing and others to the Police Department. After questioning the details, it was completely false. Huang Bingkun and the other four were detained and sent to the First Special Zone Court. The Police Department lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted on the crime of falsely reporting kidnapping and requested an extension to question the four defendants. The confessions were evasive and asked for leniency. Jiang Shuzi, the car pusher, ordered them to be detained again and rescheduled for verification.</p>
<h3>Xinzha Bridge Closed Early; Two Iron Nets Added in the Middle of the Bridge</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese naval marine guard was sniped at on Xinzha Bridge on the 28th of last month, the precautions have been strengthened day by day. In addition to the original two guards, there are now four, and three barbed wire racks more than ten feet long have been added to the northern part of the bridge, leaving only narrow passages on the left and right, through which only one person can pass. From the day before yesterday, it was closed at 7:00 pm (new clock). The iron gate on the southern side of the concession also blocked it at the same time.</p>
<h3>Woman Steals a Man and Gets Pregnant; Abortion Causes Illness; Midwife and Lover are Both Detained</h3>
<p>Shen Xu (34 years old), a woman from Zhenjiang, lives at No. 8, Gengyi Lane, Changping Road. Recently, she had a relationship with Xiang Shijun from Taizhou, who lives at No. 98, Yongshun Lane on the same road. She became pregnant and her abdomen swelled. Therefore, she discussed with Xiang to remove a piece of meat from her abdomen. She asked Jiangbei woman Zheng Yao to use a herbal medicine to remove Shen Xu's fetus, but the bleeding did not stop. She went to Guangren Hospital for treatment. Later, her aunt Shen Zhu reported the information to the Gordon Road Police Department, which dispatched detective Bai Wenqi to detain Zheng Yao and Xiang Shijun and send them to a court. Police Department lawyer Jiang Baolian applied for detention. Judge Huang Risheng briefly questioned the two defendants and ordered them to be detained separately and rescheduled for verification.</p>
<h3>Cantonese Man Commits Suicide in Inn</h3>
<p>A Cantonese man named Pang Shuncheng, aged thirty-five, checked into room 210 of the Da Zhong Hotel at the Zhengjia Wood Bridge intersection on Avenue Edward VII a few days ago. For reasons unknown, he ingested poison and committed suicide that night. The next morning, the tea attendant discovered him dead in his bed and reported it to the police. The body was sent to the coroner's office. Since he had no family, the Tongren Fuyuan Branch took photos and arranged burial, awaiting family members to claim the body. The deceased was wearing a Western-style suit, a coffee-colored woolen coat, white-gray striped woolen trousers, and yellow leather shoes. If there are family members, they can claim the body from the French police station and the coroner's office.</p>
<h3>China Anti-Tuberculosis Hospital First Clinic Grand Opening Today</h3>
<p>The China Anti-Tuberculosis Hospital was jointly designed by the late philanthropist Chen Bohong, public health experts Li Ting'an, Yan Fuqing, Ding Huikang, Lu Meiseng, and Lu Shoulun. More than fifty acres of land at the Yiwuyuan base, south of the Puji Sanatorium on the Shanghai-Minhang Road, was purchased for the construction of the hospital building. However, due to the outbreak of the incident, the project was suspended. Now, due to the rapid increase in the city's population and the high cost of living, the problem of tuberculosis has become increasingly serious. In order to meet the urgent needs of society, the First Clinic has been established at 934A No. 2, Jing'an Temple Road (intersection of Medhurst Road). The clinic has all the latest medical equipment for lung diseases, and a giant X-ray machine newly shipped from the United States. The machine has anti-vibration and automatic temperature control devices, and is one of the newest equipment in the East. Everything is now ready, and the grand opening is scheduled for today. The outpatient registration fee is only one yuan, which is truly good news for the relief of tuberculosis among the common people.</p>
<h3>Yu Qiaqing Still Staying in Chongqing The Report of His Return to Hong Kong is Inaccurate</h3>
<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing left Shanghai for Hong Kong last month, and then flew to Chongqing. He originally planned to return to his hometown in Sanbei for recuperation via Shanghai. According to recent reports, Mr. Yu had already returned to Hong Kong from Chongqing. However, according to a reporter from Datong News Agency, who inquired with Mr. Yu's confidants in Shanghai, it was learned that Mr. Yu is still staying in Chongqing. The news of his return to Hong Kong is inaccurate. It is also learned that Mr. Yu, as his hometown has fallen into enemy hands, has also abandoned the idea of returning to his hometown for recuperation. He will not leave Chongqing in the short term.</p>
<h3>Various Commercial Banks Increase Interest Rates on Deposits in the Interior</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy jointly issued an order to encourage the transfer of Shanghai funds to the interior, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, and the Agricultural Bank first followed the order to increase the interest rates on deposits in the interior. In addition to the exchange and remittance fees, funds remitted from Shanghai to the interior will also be given preferential treatment. The government guarantees the safety of the principal and interest of the funds transferred to the interior. Recently, various commercial banks, such as China Industrial Bank, have also increased interest rates on deposits in the interior. The weekly interest rate for current savings is 6%, the interest rate for fixed deposits of half a year is 9%, one year is 1%, and five years is 1.2%. All of these will be implemented from April 1.</p>
<h3>Another Fifty Jewish Refugees from Poland Arrive All Landed at Wusong</h3>
<p>It is heard that the Soviet ship "Arctic", which arrived in Shanghai on Thursday, carried fifty Jewish refugees from Poland occupied by Germany. They all landed at Wusong. These people departed from Poland, passed through Siberia, and boarded a ship in Vladivostok to come to Shanghai. The "Arctic" set sail for Hong Kong southbound on Friday.</p>
<h3>Robbery Log</h3>
<p>The Yitaixiang Clock Shop at 396 South Road in the Public Concession was suddenly visited by four customers at 11:30 yesterday morning. It was later discovered that the four customers were actually robbers. Upon entering and reaching the counter, they immediately changed their expressions and took out two handguns, threatening the shop assistants. As a result, three watches and 1,200 yuan in cash were robbed before they fled and disappeared without a trace. Afterwards, the shop reported the incident to the police station for investigation.</p>
<p>At 0:15 yesterday afternoon, two thieves suddenly broke into No. 3, Lane 36, North Henan Road, Public Concession. They threatened with weapons and robbed 400 yuan in cash before fleeing.</p>
<h3>Yuan Songnian Painting Exhibition Opens</h3>

<p>Issue 369 Economic Special Issue</p>
<h3>US-German Trade Strategy</h3>
<p>— Translated by Wang Yifang from the American Foreign Affairs Quarterly</p>
<p>Today's decisive battle is of great concern to everyone regarding the future trends of international trade. The United States is the economic overlord of the world, while Germany already has the momentum to swallow Western Europe and compete with the United States. Therefore, in the future international economy, the United States and Germany have a pivotal impact. This article was co-authored by two famous American economists, W. Bidwell and R. Upgren, and published in the January issue of the Foreign Affairs Quarterly. It suggests many strategies that the United States should adopt in the future. Although they still advocate the principle of freedom, they have modified their views on group economics. Reading this article can reveal a glimpse of the current intrigues between the United States and Germany. The original article was translated by Ms. Wang Shishi for the "Selected Essays on Chinese and Foreign Economies" monthly magazine. We are very fortunate to have obtained the consent of the translator and the magazine to publish it in our magazine first. The full text is very long, originally titled "US National Defense Trade Policy." This is only a section of its trade strategy, so the title is changed to match the content.</p>
<p>—Editor</p>
<p>The term "national defense," in its narrowest sense, means preventing enemy troops from landing and preventing enemy air forces from bombing cities. If the definition of national defense is as stated above, then the area of US prevention will be limited to the US mainland and its affiliated countries. However, the broad definition of "national defense" today is to protect the country so that important domestic interests are not threatened by the outside world; not only must physical objects be free from threat, but also the stability of the economic organization and the permanence of the system must be free from threat. As the meaning of national defense is expanded, the area of prevention must also be expanded. The United States is now thinking of Canada, the countries of the Western Hemisphere, and the United Kingdom; and recognizing that the methods of prevention are not limited to warships, airplanes, and tanks. The United States has powerful financial and economic weapons. Before the expansion of armaments is completed, economic weapons can be used. This article details the United States' use of economic weapons, its buying and selling power in international trade, and its lending capacity.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Nazi Sphere of Influence</h3>
<p>At present, Nazi Germany has placed almost the entire European continent, except for Russia and the Baltic countries, under its political and military control. However, Germany's power does not seem to extend to the entire Mediterranean basin and the Near East. Assuming that Germany can complete industrial and agricultural development within its control area, its potential will be even greater. If one wants to seek the combined strength of various countries, whose self-sufficiency and various strengths are equal to Germany's strength, and whose economic strength is sufficient to support modern naval and land forces, then one must unite all countries in the world other than Germany's sphere of influence into one group.</p>
<p>The 400 million residents in the German-controlled area include the best-trained and most skilled workers. This vast urban area, between the North Sea and the Black Sea, between the Baltic and the Sahara Desert, contains various soils and climates. Germany, France, the Danncbian States, and North Africa have vast wheat-producing areas; Poland, the Czech Republic, and France have sweet potato and beet sugar-producing areas; Spain, Italy, and southern France have vineyards, olive groves, and orange groves. Large amounts of coal and iron are important for heavy industry. From 1937 to 1938, the iron and copper production capacity in the above-mentioned areas was almost equal to that of the United States, and its shipbuilding capacity exceeded that of the United States by three times, the ratio being four to one.</p>
<p>Import and export trade statistics indicate that Europe has already achieved economic self-sufficiency. In 1937, the total international trade value of 26 European countries was 200 billion US dollars. In this amount, 60% was trade between European countries, and 40% was trade with countries outside Europe. Since 1937, Germany's bilateral trade policy has been intensified due to the British blockade in September 1939, and trade between European countries has become even more important. If Germany can maintain its political and military control over the European continent, Germany will force the European continent to become self-sufficient due to the pressure of war. The common method is to make European countries buy as many needed goods as possible from other European countries. Conversely, European countries must sell as many of their surplus goods as possible to European group countries. In this way, trade between Europe can increase from 60% to 75%. If this policy had been enforced in 1937, the value of European goods seeking markets outside Europe would have been reduced by nearly half.</p>
<p>Centralized control of the European continent's import and export trade will reduce its dependence on imports, allowing it to become self-sufficient in food; but self-sufficiency in industrial raw materials is more difficult to achieve. Now, taking Europe as a group, in 1937, its production and consumption of rye, wheat, and sweet potatoes were balanced. The production and sales of two important feed grains, barley and oats, are also balanced. There are also exports of meat, butter, and cheese, but this does not indicate true self-sufficiency, because the livestock, pig, and dairy industries rely heavily on imported grains, oilseeds, and oil cakes as feed. In short, if Europe slightly reduces the purchase of goods from non-European group countries to the minimum, the shortage of food in Europe will be very serious. Sugar, livestock, and vegetable oils will be scarce, and Europe will have no tea, coffee, or cocoa, and these stimulants are more important during periods of food shortages. If tobacco consumption is entirely supplied by Europe, the quantity will be reduced to half of what it is today.</p>
<p>In terms of industrial raw materials, imports and exports of coal and pig iron are balanced, which means that two important raw materials in modern industry can be self-sufficient. Two non-ferrous ores, magnesite and bauxite, can be self-sufficient, but for many other raw materials, the European group must rely on supplies from outside the group.</p>
<p>If Nazi Germany can conquer the Near East and develop industry using integrated methods, it can solve Europe's oil problem. Collecting scrap metal, and using substitutes for rubber, cotton, and wool, are methods to make up for the lack of raw materials in times of emergency. The most important method in times of emergency is to limit the consumption of civilians so that the materials used by the army are not restricted. However, emergency situations cannot last long, and the value of substitutes is very expensive; because substitutes require a lot of labor and money. And consumers often feel that integrated products are not as satisfactory as imported products. All of these must be noted when estimating the effectiveness of Europe's post-war economic self-sufficiency.</p>
<h3>The Impact of the Nazi Plan on the United States</h3>
<p>Assuming that Nazi Germany wants to make full use of Europe's natural resources, develop inter-European trade, and reduce reliance on supplies from non-European groups; and assuming that this economic policy will be successful, what impact will this have on the interests of the United States? What kind of policy can protect the interests of the United States?</p>
<p>After the success of Nazi economic policy, the majority of manufactured goods needed by the European continent will undoubtedly be supplied by Germany. As a result, the US export trade to the European continent will suffer a major loss. For decades, due to changes in the US economy and retaliatory tariff policies in countries on both sides of the Atlantic, the US trade in the European market has declined. However, in 1937, manufactured goods exported to the European continent were still worth 345 million yuan, and semi-finished products and raw materials were worth 463 million yuan. This trade accounted for 19% and 31% of the US's total exports.</p>
<p>Even under the new system, if its economic functions are effective, Europe will still need raw materials and feed worth 100 million yuan each year. The payment for its purchases will naturally be repaid by the products of European factories. Therefore, in the world market, especially in South America, European manufactured goods will have fierce competition with goods from other countries. Before the outbreak of this war, the European market sold half of South American exports. Germany, in order to control the purchasing power of the European continent, can monopolize the international trade of the European continent with agreements for large-scale bilateral purchases, thus almost driving out the US trade in the European market.</p>
<p>How can the United States prevent its interests from being threatened? The United States attempts to organize a group under its leadership, so that its economic and military potential are equal to or even exceed those of the European continent group. Trade and production statistics indicate that we must unite the Western Hemisphere, the British Empire, the Dutch East Indies, etc., that is, unite all countries in the world in the non-German group. However, Europe under German influence can still occupy neighboring areas with its military superiority. Furthermore, before our organization is completed, or we may have already started a war with Japan.</p>
<h3>How Can Rice Prices Be Stabilized?</h3>
<p>— Bao Leti</p>
<p>There is no problem with the city's food supply; the only problem is that there seems to be no way to deal with the soaring rice prices. Is there really no way? No! It only depends on whether the municipal authorities have the determination to insist on stabilizing rice prices.</p>
<p>Stabilizing rice prices should be regarded as one of the police duties. Police laws are absolute, and all laws and regulations regarding the rice market should also be absolute. One cannot suspect that the price limit policy is inappropriate and revoke it because rice brokers and others refuse to enter the market. If this is done, it is worse than damp firecrackers.</p>
<p>To ensure that there is no lasting problem with the city's food supply, there are only two ways: one is to encourage rice imports, not to restrict rice imports. Because the more rice is imported, the better. Therefore, in addition to commercial imports, the municipal authorities should do everything possible to facilitate commercial rice imports, and at the same time, directly operate public rice imports to prevent importers from manipulating market prices. However, one must not refuse merchants to transport rice to Shanghai because the municipal authorities are directly operating public rice imports. If this is done, it is not enriching the city's food supply, but competing with the people for profit and disregarding the people's food supply. According to yesterday's evening newspaper, the authorities of the Public Concession plan to assume the exclusive rights to import and export rice in the city. The exclusive right to export rice is reasonable and necessary. But the claim that imports will also be exclusively managed seems unlikely to be true. Unless the authorities absolutely bear the responsibility of long-term and unlimited supply of cheap rice, the exclusive import right is considered reasonable. Otherwise, one cannot help but think of the so-called evaluation meetings in the past, which often "stopped halfway and did not move forward."</p>
<p>Merely paying attention to supply and not managing distribution is as futile as merely managing distribution without paying attention to supply. Therefore, while encouraging rice imports, one must still strictly manage the rice market. Until now, the municipal authorities seem to have put some thought into the management of the rice market. Unfortunately, those thoughts have provided opportunities for rice merchants to raise prices and manipulate the market. If you look back at the past price increases, there has not been a major price surge that was not discovered after announcing a new price limit. We are not saying that price limits are the reason for price increases; we are just saying that because the authorities only limit prices and do not actively maintain price limits, they have instead promoted the reaction of rice weevils in the market. A price limit policy is an absolutely indispensable means of stabilizing rice prices, but it must be conditional on strictly eliminating all illegal transactions. The failure of the past price limit policy was only because it only wrote a price limit notice, and only allowed various newspapers to publish the authorities' determination to maintain the price limit. The fact that the price limit could not be maintained and instead became a factor stimulating the market was certainly not accidental.</p>
<p>To maintain the price limit, the only condition is to maintain the prestige of the municipal authorities. As mentioned earlier: stabilizing rice prices should be regarded as police work. Police laws are absolute, so price limits are also absolute. If the price limit is revoked because there are under-the-table deals, then the police who fight theft can also be revoked because there are theft cases. This is too absurd.</p>
<p>I remember that in this magazine, I advocated revoking the business licenses of those who violated the price limit transaction, confiscating their illegal transaction products at the same time, and forcibly buying their stored rice at the price limit, and using this rice as the basis for a public rice system. This is indeed a powerful method. Some may think that this method is too undemocratic and may even lead to the risk of a city-wide rice industry strike. The truth is that there is no problem at all.</p>
<p>First, in terms of democracy: the public system is fundamentally a product of democracy. Compulsory purchase is also a common policy in times of emergency. Moreover, for food issues, places like London implement rationing based on population and prohibit the private hoarding of rice, which is much stricter than public operation. Moreover, illegal transaction products are inherently no different from stolen goods, and should be confiscated without leniency.</p>
<p>As for the risk of a rice industry strike, it is indeed expected. There have been cases of using strikes to resist price limits in the past, but if the authorities are determined to balance the city's food supply, the strike will not only not aggravate the food difficulties, but will also promote the soundness of the city's food policy. Because the strike of rice weevils can save the procedure of revoking business licenses, immediately forcibly buying all the stored rice of the strikers, and implementing public rice operations. The funding for this purchase must be paid after the public sale. If the authorities are determined to limit prices, then rice merchants will never dare to threaten them with strikes again.</p>
<h3>What I Saw, Heard, and Thought</h3>
<p>"The Four Banks Incident gave a considerable stimulus to the market; why is it that the market has not had any good impact after the Four Banks resumed business?" Someone asked this question, and my answer is, "Those who used the Four Banks Incident to speculate long were buying in at very expensive prices. If they hastily flipped their positions to short, they would be completely defeated. Moreover, thieves do not go empty-handed; even if they cannot steal money, they have to pick up a brick and take a 'lucky' break. Look at the current speculative markets, the closing price is always smaller than the opening price; this is the strategy of those long positions covering their retreat. By the time others realize it, they have all become Zhuge Liangs in an empty city scheme; thus, the market price plummeted, and those who were slow to run away were left with nothing."</p>
<p>In fact, the Municipal Council took the opportunity of the Four Banks' resumption of business to sound the retreat. "Because of the closure of the Four Banks, we were afraid that the market would change drastically, so we had to limit the price of rice; now that the Four Banks have resumed business, the price limit should be lifted." Who says it is not appropriate?</p>
<p>But it reminds me of a couplet that someone jokingly gave to Qingliange. The first line is "The people starve to death, starve to death, all starve to death"; the second line is "The rice weevils, long live, long live, a hundred million lives." Although it is not well-crafted, it is true.</p>
<p>Someone asked, "Why must the United States officially announce the freezing of foreign funds in the United States first?" My answer is: "In addition to political effects, there are also economic effects. Because they are not afraid of the escape of foreign funds, but they are afraid that they will stay and not escape, and buy goods at any time. Therefore, while expanding the scope of the embargo on military supplies, they also use the 'freeze' propaganda to scare this group of foreign funds, so that they turn into 'paper money' and escape the United States. If they are willing to be prisoners, the US Treasury will naturally generously accommodate them."</p>
<p>Public utilities will increase prices by 100%, which is worthy of being "full of foreign flavor."</p>
<h3>How the National Defense Trade Plan Should Be</h3>
<p>To avoid barter trade and bilateral agreements in its international trade, the United States should first enhance its trade with Canada and the Caribbean countries. The political connection between the United States and Canada is becoming more important due to the establishment of the Permanent Joint Board on Defense.</p>
<p>The United States has a dominant position in trade with Mexico and the Caribbean region, where its main products, such as bananas and coffee, complement U.S. agricultural products. However, sugar, oil, and copper are competitive goods, but the United States can absorb them in large quantities without causing economic disruption.</p>
<p>Military precautions, though often emphasized, cannot adequately solve the United States' trade problems in economic terms. Even the freest trade between the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean countries cannot sell \$1.5 billion worth of manufactured goods, an amount that can be sold in foreign markets. Canada cannot find buyers for its annual surplus of 200 million to 250 million bushels of wheat. We must realize that half of the income of the 2.5 million residents in western Canada comes from the surplus of wheat exports.</p>
<p>The Caribbean countries also have export surpluses. Even countries economically connected to the United States sell more than \$500 million worth of sugar, coffee, oil, and copper annually outside the Western Hemisphere. If the economies of the United States and Canada are to be stable, it is clear that the scope of trade must be expanded.</p>
<p>For group trade to be effective, the following conditions must be met: (1) Trade within the defined area must benefit from the mutual supplementation of basic industries. (2) Most of the essential raw materials for modern industry and military precautions must be self-sufficient. However, the situation in the Western Hemisphere does not meet the above conditions for group trade.</p>
<p>The United States currently has two foreign policies: (1) To defend the security of the Western Hemisphere in economic and military terms. (2) To assist the British Empire in resisting the Axis powers by various means. American citizens expressed full support for these two policies during the recent presidential election.</p>
<p>The outcome of the European war will be one of the following three scenarios: (1) Britain wins completely, which means overthrowing the Nazi forces and liberating the European republics. (2) Germany wins completely, Britain will cooperate with the Continental bloc, the British Empire will be divided, and the fleet will be destroyed. (3) Both sides are in a stalemate and make peace, in which case Hitler will still dominate Europe, and Britain will still have its fleet and empire.</p>
<p>Assuming any of the above outcomes in Europe, the United States must have a hypothetical policy to suit the situation. However, this does not solve the current situation. Because the important point for Americans today is not "How will the United States trade with Europe after the war?" but "How to make the outcome of the war most beneficial to the United States."</p>
<p>A complete German victory will obviously restrict the United States' free foreign trade and foreign affairs. American merchants will operate within the Nazi trade agreement network, and the United States, for self-defense, will have to implement a Western Hemisphere or Northwestern Hemisphere trade policy to regulate its economy.</p>
<p>However, we must realize that whether Britain wins completely or makes peace, the United States will not rebuild a world free trade policy. The economic reforms caused by the war in Britain, even after the war, will continue the wartime controlled trade policy both internally and externally. The tendency to focus on bilateral trade before 1939 was already very obvious. But whether the bilateral trade policy is permanent will depend on the trade situation in the Western Hemisphere and whether the United States can maintain a free trade zone.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the above opinions is twofold: (1) The United States should do everything possible to step up aid to Britain and increase the number of aircraft and ships, and immediately lift the restrictions on credit and ships imposed by the Johnson Act and the Neutrality Act. (2) Expand assistance as the war continues. After the war, in order to monopolize Nazi controlled trade, a Western Hemisphere and British Empire economic bloc must now be planned.</p>
<p>A year ago, this proposal seemed unnecessary. Six months ago, this proposal still seemed unnecessary. But today, understanding the Nazi threat and the strength of British resistance, we must prepare bold and proactive measures. This is a union based on economic interests. In the political sphere, all those who lean towards democratic ideals and whose beliefs are violated should be united.</p>
<p>The organization of political ties is beyond the scope of this article, but preferential tariffs and exchange rate stability are clearly included in political ties. The purpose of the aforementioned political ties with other countries is not to minimize the foreign trade of each associated country. If there is adequate defense, we are very willing to trade with other countries or other groups. If other countries can trade on free principles, we will establish ties with them. Therefore, all countries that love peace and freedom can join this associated group. Within the group, loans, borrowing, immigration, and trade can be carried out without fear of exploitation and oppression.</p>

<h3>The Fate of Europe's Diamond Industry During Wartime</h3>
<p>— Continued from yesterday's newspaper</p>
<p>(5) The Impact on Holland and Belgium</p>
<p>The British government's vigorous measures have had a tremendous impact on the diamond industry centers in several cities in Holland and Belgium. Since the beginning of the war, diamond merchants have encountered several intractable problems, such as the difficulty in selling luxury goods during wartime, the lack of insurance for overseas transportation, the instability of currency links between countries, especially the United States, to which the diamond industry is a matter of life and death! Now, they are faced with the restrictions and cut off of raw material sources, as well as the eagerness of the invading countries to try their luck, and the possibility of invading the country at any time. How can the diamond industry maintain its composure in such a tense atmosphere? Therefore, before the German invasion, many diamond merchants in Antwerp had decided to relocate. After September 1939, nearly 100 major stores moved to the United States, Brazil, Portugal, or other safer places. You can imagine that this relocation is not just a few ordinary merchants, but also brokers, craftsmen, technicians, and all personnel related to diamonds, a large number of people are leaving! Some statistics show that there are already 30,000 workers skilled in this field in Antwerp alone! This act of seeking refuge overseas will undoubtedly be more active after being invaded by the enemy. This is undoubtedly a major and irreparable loss to the economies of Holland and Belgium! Moreover, these people who have moved away will probably not return to their hometowns in the short term. Especially if the war continues to drag on, even if they can return to the country in the future, they have already created competitive craftsmen and technicians for themselves overseas, in other countries, because the secrets of their industry will undoubtedly be spied upon by others!</p>
<p>(6) Conclusion</p>
<p>The conclusion is: The luxury diamond industry, relying on its strict organization, abundant funds, and special technology, may not be as easily eliminated by war as other luxury industries. However, on the old continent of Europe—the old continent that is often dominated by war, revolution, and unrest!—it has already failed to find the environment and conditions necessary for its survival. These environments and conditions, such as market customers, can only be found in the New World, especially in the United States. So, will it abandon its birthplace forever?</p>

<h3>Finance: Silver Futures and Spot Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Bombay, 3rd—The Indian silver market saw a rise of two annas in both futures and spot prices. The market was flat, with a total of 50 transactions. There was no market in the US and British silver markets.</p>
<p>Central Bank Closed Today</p>
<p>The Joint Reserve Committee of the banking industry in this city issued a circular to all exchange banks yesterday, stating that the Central Bank had informed them that May 5th (Monday), as the anniversary of the establishment of the Revolutionary Government, the bank would be closed for one day as usual. All notes related to the Central Bank and the Central Trust Bureau would be presented for exchange on the following day (6th). As for other money businesses, they will remain open as usual.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Senate Passes Cotton Farmer Loans, American Cotton Surges, Indian Cotton Rises Due to Short Covering</h3>
<p>American Cotton, 3rd—The market was firm and active, rising due to purchases and the US Senate Committee unanimously passing 85% cotton farmer loans and good cotton cloth trade. As a result of closing, prices surged by 23 to 27 points higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>Indian Cotton, 3rd—The market initially fell due to cotton merchants short selling, then rebounded due to short covering and speculative purchases. As a result of closing, prices rose by 0.25 to 0.75 rupees higher than the previous day. Furthermore, the opening forecast for today expects an increase of two and a half rupees.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Toon Buds Offered Fresh, Five-Spice Vegetables Scarce, River Mouth Ear Fungus Relaxes</h3>
<p>Toon Buds: Currently one of the seasonal vegetarian dishes. The first batch of new goods totaled 150 packages. The market price has not yet opened, but scattered sales have been priced at \$300, a price that is too high, so the demand side is not interested. There are only social transactions, and the market is bound to relax.</p>
<p>Five-Spice Vegetables: Also an excellent vegetarian product. Currently, the supply is tight, and the price has risen repeatedly. Yesterday, the market sold for \$85. There are also not many Beijing winter vegetables, and the selling price is the same.</p>
<p>Wood Ear Fungus: After the market price rose, sales have been sluggish recently, so the market has softened. Yesterday, 33 packages of River Mouth ear fungus were opened, priced at \$745, a decrease of 7% compared to the peak. The market price followed suit.</p>

<h3>Commemoration of the Establishment of the Revolutionary Government: Schools Begin Sports and Health Week Today, Celebrate with Flags but No Holiday, Health Competitions Stipulated</h3>
<p>(Guanghua News Agency) Today is the anniversary of the establishment of the Revolutionary Government. All schools at all levels in this city are flying flags to celebrate, but there is no holiday. However, lectures will be given on the significance of the establishment of the Revolutionary Government and the historical facts of the President's assumption of the Extraordinary Grand President's office. All staff and students are determined to follow the President's will and complete the current mission. Also, starting today, in accordance with central regulations, the National Sports and Health Movement Week will be implemented until the 12th of this month. All public and private primary and secondary schools in the city will implement it automatically and will hold student health competitions based on their equipment conditions. Major hospitals are also fully supporting and providing convenience. The main points of the health competition method are as follows: (1) The health competition should first conduct health checks, and evaluations should be made based on the check results, and awards may be given separately, but the principle is to be universal. (2) Students participating in the health competition are temporarily limited to primary and secondary school students. (3) The evaluation of student health competitions should be divided into the following two types: A. Group, based on each school, divided into four groups: high school, junior high school, senior elementary school, junior elementary school, and kindergarten students. For schools that run more than two groups, their results should be calculated together. B. Individual, based on each student, divided into male and female. Students who meet the health standards should not be graded and are called "Healthy Students." (4) The procedures for holding student health competitions are divided into the following two types: A. Preliminary round, the principal of each school supervises the school doctor, physical education teacher, and class teacher to conduct inspections and select a number of relatively healthy students from each group to participate in the semi-finals. (5) Entrust public and private hospitals or doctors to be responsible for inspection matters. (6) When holding student health competitions, efforts should be made to promote them, and health exhibitions, health education films, and health broadcasts should be held to arouse the attention of the community. During the preliminary and semi-final inspections, parents of students should be invited to visit the venue. (7) Students with defects found during the inspection should be statistically analyzed separately, and active measures should be taken to correct them. The expenses for correction should be paid under the education funding. The correction methods can be separately contracted with local medical institutions for group treatment, giving preferential treatment to students' medical treatment and correction. It is scheduled from May 5th to 12th, the National Sports and Health Movement Week will be held in various provinces and cities, and student health checks will be held at the same time, and the Children's Health Inspection Day will be held on May 15th at the same time.</p>
<h3>Eighth Plenary Session Resolution: Education and Culture Program</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Aviation News) The Eighth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, which was held for ten days, with a total of eleven plenary sessions, closed satisfactorily at 6:30 pm on April 2nd. There were more than 80 resolutions at this meeting, among which the "Outline of the Three-Year Construction Plan During Wartime" was particularly important. The important resolutions on education are excerpted below: (1) A large number of popular books and newspapers and periodicals annotated with phonetic Chinese characters should be compiled and printed for the public who have learned phonetic symbols to read, so as to exert the effect of propaganda and training. (2) Actively promote the phonetic literacy movement, with the aim of popularizing phonetic literacy and thoroughly eliminating illiteracy within five years, so as to promote the Three People's Principles. (3) Please set up a Frontier Language and Northwest and Southwest Culture Research Institute to cultivate frontier talents and benefit the implementation of frontier administration. (4) Provinces should try to improve the treatment of normal school students in a practical way, and the central government should allocate special funds for appropriate subsidies to establish a foundation for national construction. (5) Please ask the central government to increase the allocation of subsidies to promote national education. (6) Improve teachers' lives so that they can teach with peace of mind to emphasize education and benefit national construction. (7) Higher education is becoming increasingly difficult, please raise large sums of money as soon as possible to maintain it.</p>
<p>In addition, the "Outline of the Three-Year Construction Plan During Wartime" also passed important resolutions on the educational and cultural construction program. The original text is as follows: In the next three years, the education business should be more closely coordinated with military, political, economic, and social construction work in accordance with the policy set by the Fifth National Congress and the Provisional National Congress of the Party, so that the development of the business and the cultivation of talents can be carried out side by side to complete the mission. The facilities of each level of education should follow the following principles: (1) The promotion of national education should be coordinated with the new county system. In Sichuan, Xikang, Guizhou, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Zhejiang, Anhui and other provinces, the establishment of a central school in each township and at least one national school in every two guaranteed households should be completed within three years. (2) The facilities of secondary education should seek quantitative development on the one hand, and qualitative improvement on the other, so as to be able to connect with the needs of national education, higher education, and national defense and production undertakings. Special attention should be paid to the expansion and transformation of normal education and women's education. (3) Higher education should be coordinated by the central government according to the manpower and financial resources permitted and the needs of the development of various undertakings, and expanded appropriately. Special attention should be paid to encouraging the establishment of specialized schools in various provinces. When adding colleges and universities, attention should be paid to the balanced development of various departments. Research institutes should be added. For the existing colleges and universities, efforts should be made to enrich the equipment. (4) Social education should pay special attention to improving the people's lives and cultivating their intelligence and morals. Therefore, in addition to continuing to run the original business, attention should be paid to the compilation of teaching materials, the training of teachers, and the expansion of the scope of teaching to achieve the effect of popularizing education. (5) Frontier education should raise sufficient funds to expand it as much as possible, and pay attention to adapting to the local environment to lay the foundation for national unity. (6) Education in guerrilla areas should be closely linked with military party affairs and continue to intensify promotion. (7) Overseas Chinese education should seek to expand it by various methods adapted to the environment. First, pay attention to the training of teachers and the compilation of teaching materials, and implement a supervision system to strengthen the connection between home and abroad.</p>
<h3>China Education Foundation: This Year's Work</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Correspondence) The Board of Directors of the China Education and Culture Foundation held a formal meeting on the 18th of last month. The directors proposed many proposals. There were 23 groups requesting subsidies for the 30th year, requiring approximately one million yuan. This year's work focuses on natural sciences. According to Monroe, the United States admires our country's wartime education. Under the bombing of Japanese aircraft, universities and cultural groups continue to struggle. The tenacious spirit is admired throughout the United States, and they actively donate to the Foundation's funds to provide Chinese students with mechanical, automobile, aircraft, and radio manufacturing studies in the United States. Currently, 26 Chinese students have received assistance. It is hoped that China and the United States can raise huge sums of money to increase the number of students studying in the United States.</p>
<h3>Xiuxue Lecture: How to Choose Books (1)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Liangsheng</p>
<p>There are countless books from ancient times to the present. It is impossible to read all the endless books in our limited years. Zhuangzi said, "My life has a limit, but knowledge has no limit. To follow the unlimited with the limited is dangerous." Not only do we not have time to read them all, but there is no need to read them all at all. We only need to make choices among the endless books. The essence of books is good and bad. Reading good books is certainly beneficial. What if they are bad? Reading them is harmful. How to choose books is indeed a very important issue. Now, the "Principles of Exploring Books" and "Standards for Choosing Books" are explained in two parts below.</p>
<p>1. Principles of Choosing Books</p>
<p>Reading and life should be linked together and form a whole. Reading is not a pastime to embellish elegance, it is a means to improve and enrich life. Books are not just recreational products after tea and wine, they are tools for cultivating knowledge and skills in life. We must have a clear principle for choosing books. What is it? It is, "Suitable for your own needs." In other words, what books a person should read and what books he should read should only be selected according to his own life.</p>
<p>(1) Concerning one's own duties: Since everyone's duties are different, the books that each person chooses to read or can read are different. The books that writers should read are different from those that scientists should read, and the books that politicians should read are different from those that industrialists should read. For example, Xia Mianzun said, "A doctor of internal medicine should first read books and magazines about internal medicine. This is reading about duties."</p>
<p>(2) Concerning reference research: Everyone's duties are different, and everyone's reference in research is of course different. For example, Xia Mianzun said, "If this doctor pays attention to the types of mosquitoes because of the research on malaria, he will turn to a certain biology book; because of the distribution of malaria mosquitoes, he will turn to a certain geography book; because of the properties of a certain drug, he will check a certain plant book or mineral book; because of the suspicion of a certain word, he will check a certain dictionary. This is reference reading."</p>

<h3>Police Spring Games: Registration Closing Soon</h3>
<p>The Police Spring Games, sponsored by the Shanghai Public Concession Bureau Police Department, are actively preparing for this year's (31st) session. Hui Tejun, deputy police chief and secretary of the conference, announced yesterday morning that the date of this year's Spring Games has been decided to be held on June 7th, and the venue will still be at the Racecourse. Registration for all events will close on the 10th of this month (next Saturday). Among all the open events, the most interesting and competitive is the invitation relay race with different distances. The champion of the previous session was the West Qing team, and West Qing is still the most popular in this session, but the Mai Lings team has also prepared to get involved, so it is expected to be an unprecedented thrilling fight. The entire distance of the different distance relay is one mile, which is divided into four sections: 220 yards, 440 yards, 880 yards, and 220 yards, so the interest is very strong. According to the 31 events of the Police Spring Games, in addition to the Chinese and Western Police Championships and various group events, including two invitation championships and five open championships, the two invitation championships are (1) 880-yard school relay race, (2) one-mile different distance relay race, and the five open championships are (1) 100 yards, (2) 440 yards, (3) one mile, (4) two-mile team championship, (5) tug-of-war. The registration location is Mr. Hui at the General Patrol Room, No. 185 Fuzhou Road, and the deadline is the 10th of this month.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Western Cup Table Tennis Women's Group: Women's Youth Beats Peide</h3>
<p>In the Chinese and Western Cup table tennis, the first act of the women's group, Women's Youth vs. Peide, met at the auditorium of the Women's Youth Association the night before. The Women's Youth was defeated by Hualian and Jewish due to the absence of strong players before, which was a pity. Yesterday's battle was to bring out all the elites and strive to cheer up. Zhang Jiazhen, Fang Xiuwen, Hu Jiahe, Xu Ruilan, Zhang Dexin, and other five generals showed their skills, like a broken bamboo. Peide retreated steadily, and only relied on the efforts of Miss Haiyin and Gao Bolai'er to pull back two games, so as to avoid the disaster of the entire army being wiped out. As a result, the Women's Youth won a great victory with thirteen to two, and the Women's Youth's reputation was immediately restored by this victory. When they meet Hualian Jewish in the second round in the future, they will be able to drink Huanglong to their heart's content and wash away their previous shame.</p>

<h3>Mr. Ding Fubao Discusses the Harms of Eating White Rice</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Yesterday, while discussing hygiene with Mr. Ding Fubao of Wuxi, the topic of food came up. He said that in recent times, people in cities often become gray-haired, walk with difficulty, stoop, have wrinkled faces, and experience a sharp decline in eyesight and memory before they even reach middle age. The cause of this premature aging may be excessive indulgence in carnal desires, deep-seated addictions, unfavorable circumstances, or excessive sorrow, not limited to just one factor. However, incomplete food is one of the most important factors. What is incomplete food? It is food whose main components consist only of carbohydrates with relatively little caloric value, while the other essential organic, inorganic nutrients, and supplementary nutrients necessary for the human body are completely lacking. Nowadays, the wealthy and idle class, the affluent merchants in Shanghai, eat white rice every day, which is the worst food in terms of nutrition. Comparing the components of white rice and brown rice, one can see that brown rice is superior to white rice. Brown rice contains 6.8% crude protein, 0.3% crude fat, 72.0% crude carbohydrates, 0.35% inorganic substances, and both Vitamin A and Vitamin B. Therefore, brown rice contains almost complete organic, inorganic, and supplementary nutrients, making it nearly a complete food. It is a pity that the wealthy elderly in Shanghai despise it because it is not as easy to swallow as white rice. They do not know that the rice formerly milled by human power contained bran and fiber from incomplete husks (this substance provides moderate mechanical stimulation to the intestinal tract, promoting peristalsis, making bowel movements smooth, and preventing stagnation and decay in the intestines). The polished rice also had fine white stone powder added to the brown rice. After polishing, it is smooth and beautiful. This fine white stone powder is detrimental to health. If viewed under a microscope, it contains countless particles resembling broken glass embedded in the rice. Although the rice is washed before cooking, it is difficult to completely wash away this stone powder adhering to the rice. A portion still enters the human stomach and intestines unnoticed with the white rice. Over the years, it affects the body. In my opinion, brown rice cooked properly is not so difficult to swallow. In my family, we cook brown rice by first washing away the attached dust the night before, soaking it in water in a pot. The next day, we first use high heat to cook until steam is released, then reduce the heat to half for twenty minutes, then reduce the heat again to one-sixth. Finally, we press down the lid and increase the heat again for half a minute, then turn it off. After a while, we eat it, and the taste and digestibility are both excellent. If the general modern people really cannot get used to brown rice, they may as well change to eating semi-milled rice without white powder, or semi-milled rice with a little wheat cooked together. In short, the so-called top-grade white rice in Shanghai today has a form as beautiful as pearls, but it actually lacks organic, inorganic nutrients, and supplementary nutrients, and can simply be called the dregs after the nourishing substances have been removed. Eating white rice like dregs every day for a long time, how can one not age prematurely? I am reporting this because Mr. Ding is a well-known hygienist, 65 years old, as agile as someone in their forties, and his words are scientific and have profound truth.</p>
<h3>The Utilization of Fabric Scraps</h3>
<p>— Zhao</p>
<p>When we tailor clothes, aren't there many leftover fabric scraps? Indeed, these red, green, and various colored fabric scraps, we, apart from exchanging them for candy, even the candy vendor dislikes them for being too small and fragmented! It can simply be said that they are of no use at all. However, if we rashly discard them, we would feel it is too wasteful. We think: on the one hand, how much blood and sweat labor do so many farmers, workers, and merchants have to put in to create the fabric? Moreover, currently, fabric is no less valuable than rice, and the price is also rising alarmingly! Therefore, instead of discarding them, we might as well make good use of them!</p>
<p>What we must have and cannot do without when we sleep is, of course, a pillow. Recently, the value of an embroidered pillow is also considerable. If we embroider it ourselves, the embroidery thread is also very expensive, and it would also take up a lot of time and add trouble. This is our opportunity to utilize fabric scraps.</p>
<p>We first trace the pattern on the fabric scraps. For example, if it's a red flower, we trace it on a red fabric scrap. For green leaves, we naturally use green fabric scraps. Then, we cut them out one by one and sew them onto the pillow cover. The procedure is like a primary school student's collage, except one uses paste and the other uses thread. Without much effort, an economical and beautiful pillow is made.</p>
<p>I hope everyone tries it. We should also pay attention to the utilization of waste at all times to comply with the principle of thrift and cultivate the virtue of thrift.</p>
<h3>The Beauty and Ugliness of Home Arrangement</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>"Fine writing tools and paper, a pleasure in life," by extension, the same is true for a family. An ordinary family; gray and black walls, a half-size bed, a tilted bed curtain, a three-legged chair, an uneven table surface, the floor full of excrement. Even if the mistress of the house is a celestial being, an angel with unparalleled charm, I am afraid the temptation of beauty cannot withstand the dirty environment, and you cannot help but be deterred!</p>
<p>However, these people may be limited by economic conditions. Although they want to be neat, in reality, they may not be able to do it. Let's treat them as exceptions. Now, let's look at the rich. The walls are tiled with fancy bricks, but the dust on the ceiling can be used as a dance floor for butterflies. The sofa is made of high-quality teak, but the grease on the backrest may stain your clothes. The stove is placed at the entrance, the children's diapers are hung in the living room, flannel curtains still hang in June, and fans that have not been wrapped up are hanging in December. Books, newspapers, coats, and all kinds of miscellaneous objects are everywhere, without any order. Under such a home arrangement, others will find it boring, let alone the owner and mistress, who live in it every day. What they see is a chaotic impression, all chaos, chaos! Of course, it will unknowingly cause annoyance and disgust, and they will never be able to muster the original interest in the family.</p>
<p>Generally, what a person fears most is causing annoyance. In the disgusting air, we will say things we usually don't say and do things we usually can't do, which can turn a gentle and considerate person into a violent and ferocious person, easily offending others, even if it is a very ordinary and unimportant matter:</p>
<p>"Where are the gloves?" the husband asks impatiently.</p>
<p>"They were placed on the bookshelf, why can't I find them?" the wife searches for a long time without finding them, and a look of anger appears on her face!</p>
<p>"Maybe they are in the wardrobe!" But in the end, she still can't find them, and instead pulls out many scarves, balls of yarn, and unrelated things. At this time, she certainly feels annoyed and angry.</p>
<p>"Can't you even remember your own things?" She has unspeakable resentment, and maybe even thinks of his many other shortcomings.</p>
<p>He, of course, feels inexplicable annoyance, and blames her in a way that cannot be justified. Therefore, what he used to be satisfied with may now be considered a defect, and what he used to think was lovely may now be considered unlovable.</p>
<p>Each thinking of the other's faults, gradually, the love between husband and wife will develop cracks in this way, to the point of being unable to maintain it!</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that the mistresses and masters of general new families will pay considerable attention to the arrangement of the home, and not live in chaos. Everything must be appropriate. What should be improved should be improved, and what should be abolished should be abolished.</p>
<p>So that everyone maintains a good impression of the family, naturally, we will get a lot of comfort and happiness invisibly. At the same time, the feelings between husband and wife can also be strengthened by this.</p>

<h3>One Week Family Meal Plan</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Fresh broad beans are on the market again; these kinds of things are truly the only beautiful things in late spring, making people never tire of eating them. Before the war, when they first came on the market, each catty cost at most one or two dozen copper coins, but now it costs half a dollar a catty, and even these days it costs about two dimes, truly making the general housewives feel overwhelmed by the differences between the past and the present. However, although they are expensive, we cannot not eat them, so we can only save a little on the chopsticks, and we can no longer chew heartily and happily. Speaking of meat dishes, they can be stir-fried with diced meat and diced bamboo shoots, or add a little ham and cook in a white soup, which is naturally delicious. For vegetarian dishes, they can be stir-fried with snow vegetable crumbs, diced bamboo shoots, or lettuce, which is also infinitely delicious. However, add more sugar.</p>
<p>Monday: Stir-fried broad beans with diced meat, boiled carp soup, stir-fried chicken feathers, fried dough sticks with soybean sprouts</p>
<p>Tuesday: Onion beef shreds, braised tofu with prawns, braised cabbage, dried bamboo shoots stir-fried with hundred leaves</p>
<p>Wednesday: Salted egg stew with minced meat patty, scallion roasted small fish, stir-fried aster tataricus, snow vegetable braised tofu</p>
<p>Thursday: Curry beef slices, steamed dried fish with minced meat, stir-fried golden needle vegetables, shrimp roe stir-fried wheat gluten</p>
<p>Friday: Pickled pork intestine soup, silver fish stir-fried with eggs, cellophane noodles with chicken feathers, sweet and sour radish shreds</p>
<p>Saturday: Stir-fried broad beans with shredded chicken, braised sliced blackfish, stir-fried snow vegetables with broad beans, bamboo shoots mixed with lettuce</p>
<p>Sunday: Stir-fried sauce with meat, stir-fried eel back, vegetarian ten-scene, soybean sprouts</p>
<h3>From Kunming to Lashio</h3>
<p>— Guan She</p>
<p>A friend's letter:</p>
<p>This time, I went from Kunming to Lashio in a truck specially provided by the company. The normal journey takes about five to seven days. Because I was delayed in the middle, it took me eleven days to arrive. The total length of this road is 1146.1 kilometers, and eight-tenths of it is mountain road, winding around high mountains. There is no straight road longer than ten zhang, which shows the difficulty of construction. Tianzimao Slope and Jisan Slope are both about 3,000 meters high. When the car reaches the top of the mountain, looking down at the thatched huts below from inside the car, they are almost invisible. I departed from Kunming on February 14th and stayed in Xiaguan (411.6 kilometers) on the 16th, already experiencing the taste of the raging wind. There is a Yunnan ballad: "Xiaguan wind, Wanting flowers, Cangshan snow, Erhai moon," which shows the fame of "Xiaguan wind." Erhai Lake is very close to Xiaguan, but unfortunately I didn't have time to visit. On the 17th, due to rain, I stayed in Yangbi - a small village with less than ten households - looking at Cangshan Mountain from afar, the snow had not yet melted. In two days, I encountered two of the four scenes, which is enough to comfort the hardship of the journey. Yangbi is 449.2 kilometers away from Kunming and belongs to Yongping County, Yunnan. The rain stopped on the morning of the 18th, so I continued on my journey. The car sped towards the high mountains, with white clouds floating slowly, rolling with the wheels of the car, as if flying on clouds, the scene was amazing. At around 530 kilometers, there was a large stone tablet on the side of the road, with the inscription "The Place Where Zhuge Wuhou of the Han Dynasty Captured Meng Huo Seven Times." Recalling the description of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms when I was young, I couldn't help but feel fascinated. The car traveled around to the top of the mountain, and the snow on Cangshan Mountain was illuminated by the sunlight from afar, which was extremely beautiful. Because I had to cross a bridge, I stayed in the car for both nights of the 18th and 19th, sleeping on a suitcase, actually falling into a deep sleep, which I can laugh about now. Fortunately, I did not encounter any air raid alarms during this period. At about 3 o'clock on the night of the 19th, I safely crossed the Lancang River. I cannot help but admire the ingenuity of the engineers for the lightness and speed of this ferry. Although the Lancang River is dangerous, we can use cars on land to tow this new ferry across the river, and each hour can ferry five cars back and forth, which shows that human power can overcome nature. However, when paying homage to the broken bridge, one cannot help but feel melancholy. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Urgent</h3>
<p>— Jue Hui</p>
<p>The authorities' "method" was finally "thought" out after much pleading, and 110 stones of old foreign rice are to be shipped to Hong Kong. This matter will undoubtedly "cause a stir" for a while.</p>
<p>Leaving aside other things, the "method" has made many people anxious since it was announced!</p>
<p>The poor are anxious, and the "maggots" are even more anxious; the former are afraid that the "plan will change halfway," and the latter are eager to run to Hong Kong to prop up the rice bags with their stomachs!</p>
<p>However, the poor are not only anxious about this, and the "maggots" are not only anxious about this either. The poor are anxious that the rice will be hoarded again after it is shipped, and the maggots are anxious that they will not be able to escape the "yellow plum" season after the rice is shipped. "Natural disasters and man-made disasters" are really terrible!</p>
<p>So you are anxious and I am anxious, anxious enough to make everyone spin around...</p>
<h3>Another Colleague</h3>
<p>— Sima Jun</p>
<p>It's strange, people die so easily, so quickly, so abruptly. Once they are dead, they are no longer strange or bizarre, just left behind and forgotten.</p>
<p>However, in my factory, three colleagues have died in the past three years, leaving behind three young widows. This matter, if you want to say it's strange, can certainly be listed as one.</p>
<p>However, the three deceased colleagues, so young and strong, it is extremely regrettable, because they were all producers.</p>
<p>As for the most recent deceased colleague, in the days before his death, we felt that his nerves were very disturbed. His speech was incoherent, and he would hang his head after doing things for less than five minutes. When eating, he would quickly eat two bites, then drop his chopsticks and close his eyes inexplicably.</p>
<p>Imagining his symptoms, we thought he was suffering from neurasthenia caused by overwork, but no one knew that he was suffering from money sickness, the stimulation of money.</p>
<p>I remember once, he had probably gone to see a doctor and returned, his face already very thin and haggard, and he was walking slowly. He met me and asked me point-blank:</p>
<p>"You must have a thousand dollars by now!"</p>
<p>"What?" I looked at him in surprise.</p>
<p>"It's been ten years, wouldn't you have more than a thousand dollars?"</p>
<p>I smiled at him, because his expression had become very strange.</p>
<p>"I!" he pointed to his chest, "I'm carrying a debt. Alas!"</p>
<p>I knew that he had spent a lot of money on his illness, and seeing that we were healthy, he assumed that we must have more money. Who knew that small employees were living a life of hardship under the current circumstances?</p>
<p>"You're the only one who thinks about more money these days!"</p>
<p>I wanted to say this to him, but he was a money-sick person. However, his money sickness was the hope of not going hungry, not like a speculative and crazy money-sick person. So, even when he was sick, he still took care of his duties and worked hard at what he should do.</p>
<p>On the night before he died, his mind suddenly became confused, his lips turned purplish-brown, he was gasping for air, and his limbs were constantly twitching. He would sit for a while, then stand for a while, not wanting to sleep. Even if he slept, he would sit up in less than five minutes. The way he looked, it was as if an event was pressing down on him, making him very uneasy.</p>
<p>That night, we called his wife, and of course we stayed with him all night, feeling his heart beating very rapidly. We asked his wife:</p>
<p>"Which doctor is he seeing?"</p>
<p>"Who knows, he says he's seeing a nerve doctor at a mental hospital."</p>
<p>"So, what exactly is his illness?"</p>
<p>"Who knows what his illness is."</p>
<p>After midnight, we made several phone calls to call a doctor, but the doctors all said it was too late and they could only wait for dawn.</p>
<p>After dawn, the factory director and the doctor came in together. His mind suddenly became very clear, he recognized people, and his speech was coherent.</p>
<p>After taking his pulse, the doctor said that to grasp his illness, he had to have a blood test. The factory director also agreed to send him to the hospital to stay.</p>
<p>He recognized the doctor, so he kept asking questions.</p>
<p>"Is it serious? The doctor said that my eighth nerve is having problems, and it will be cured in a week, cured in a week."</p>
<p>"It's not serious, it's not a mental illness!"</p>
<p>He heard the doctor and the factory director talking, and he came up and said:</p>
<p>"If I stay in the hospital, don't deduct my salary. Factory director, you promise me." He suddenly put his hands together and bowed to the doctor: "Please save me, let me stay in the hospital!"</p>
<p>"Don't pretend to be mentally ill!"</p>
<p>"No, I'm under stimulation, this stimulation is very deep, I can't forget it, money, money!"</p>
<p>The doctor said: "Money can be used up, it can be earned, why think about it so much!"</p>
<p>He didn't say anything, he sat on the stool. He went to the hospital in the afternoon, but because there were no third-class beds, he was examined and then came back. Not this night, in the middle of the night, he suddenly deteriorated, sweating and gasping for air, and died at three o'clock.</p>
<p>We were saddened by the miserable cries. I thought, another colleague has died, but what is going on? Fate? Society?</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(VII) Drawing a Cross on His Face</p>
<p>He desperately endured the pain, struggled his head, and immediately broke free from Ji Zhaoxiong's hand. He turned his eyes, filled with anger, forcefully to his face, and his eyebrows suddenly stood up. He decided to resist at all costs!</p>
<p>"Is there anyone else? That's right, there's one more!" His furious expression did indeed deter Ji Zhaoxiong's arrogance, making him no longer dare to act rashly. Begonia's gaze then moved to Yuan Baofan's face. "This person is you!"</p>
<p>Old Yuan was also surprised and speechless.</p>
<p>"Can you tell me? What is she to you? What means did you use to deceive her here in the first place?" Begonia's voice became louder and louder. "You want to interrogate me, I'm sorry, interrogate yourself first!"</p>
<p>This was a big nail that Yuan Baofan had never encountered before.</p>
<p>"Damn it! I'll beat you to death, you bastard!" Saying that, he jumped up and slapped Begonia's face twice in a row.</p>
<p>"Well beaten, one day you will also be full of evil!"</p>
<p>A large amount of blood flowed from Begonia's lips, but he still opened his eyes wide and cursed. "Even if you beat me to death, you are still a bloodsucker of the people's wealth is death eight!"</p>
<p>Several policemen standing in the courtyard almost didn't laugh.</p>
<p>"Why don't you quickly bring me my pistol?" Yuan Baofan shouted in a rage.</p>
<p>One of the horsemen had already moved his feet to leave, but Ji Zhaoxiong suddenly stopped him.</p>

<h3>Defense Engineering on the Vegetable Basket</h3>
<p>— Ji Xiangzuo</p>
<h3>"Stale Moldy Air"</h3>
<p>— Hong Shui</p>
<p>…Finally, there is a bowl of thin porridge to eat. (Extremely "honored", those who have no "thin porridge" to stop the hunger are "everywhere"!)</p>
<p>But as soon as it reaches the mouth, it is spat out again (although extremely hungry in the stomach). It's not that the poor are picky, but that the "stale moldy air" fills the ears and nose..., otherwise, they shouldn't eat rice costing over 150 or 160 yuan per stone, they should really slap their mouths. (Whose mouth should be slapped?)</p>
<p>Everyone "knows" where the "stale moldy air" comes from.</p>
<p>People "sell rice on the first day and start eating on the twenty-ninth", still anxiously awaiting "the first day"; but some people "do not smell its stench for a long time", hoarding it single-mindedly, hoarding it until the "moldy odor shoots up to the sky", and still saying "for people to control", "source lacking"...</p>
<p>The older the old wine, the better, but "rice" will not make "stale moldy air" "more marketable to make money and get rich". Rice weevils (especially stated: real weevils in the rice) will follow the stale moldy air and come one after another, which is naturally expected.</p>
<p>In case, honest advice is unpleasant to the ear, then "in the near future" there will be a flowery news story: "There is a certain warehouse, where rice has been hoarded for several years. Now seeing the price of rice reaching × hundred yuan per stone, I started to think about selling it, but when I waited to open the door, I was horrified to find that they were all rice weevils." If you are not afraid, take a look!</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor: I recently read an article titled "The Source of Coal Dust" written by Mr. Ren Jiong in the Spring and Autumn section of your newspaper on April 30th. This article seems to be directed at our factory... I would like to analyze the facts as follows for your reference. Last October, British and Norwegian ships were banned from coastal defense, and the source of Hongji coal dust suddenly stopped, and the old stock of Hong dust was also exhausted... If we stop work abruptly due to the "Hong dust stoppage", the millions of residents of Shanghai will gradually face the danger of running out of cooking fuel. Our factory had to temporarily produce ordinary coal dust for the market. This was in October of last year. As of early January of last year, the source of Hongji coal dust was slightly smoother, and our factory immediately resumed using Hong dust as a raw material for making balls, improving the quality. At the same time, we took advantage of the distribution of calendars to once again inform users and express our deep apologies. It also said "Fortunately, Hongji dust has been able to be shipped to Shanghai. In the future, the raw materials will be improved, and the products will be of excellent quality, which will definitely be suitable for your burning use." This was in early January of this year. The reason why I do not hesitate to repeat this in detail is to solemnly point out the dates of sending the letters, because Mr. Ren's misunderstanding lies in the "time issue". Mr. Ren said, "Recently, I wrote a letter to this coal ball factory, and as a result, I received a printed reply from the factory." However, according to the notification from our factory, in addition to the above date, it was indeed distributed to regular customers, and after that, it was sealed up and never used again. In short, our factory's discounted coal balls for the cultural circles are purely because the cultural circles have meager salaries, so within the possible range, we do our best to provide preferential treatment, so that the heart can be at ease, and nothing else is considered. However, because our factory has too many regular customers and limited manpower, there may be some shortcomings. Regular customers, upon hearing that inferior coal is cheap, say that our factory's prices are high. When the delivery is slightly delayed, they say that our factory is monopolizing and hoarding. As for Mr. Ren's work, it is both laughable and illogical. Our factory does not bother to correct it one by one. We firmly believe that the facts are the most eloquent, and there will eventually be a day of clarification. Hurriedly, please start the Yitaixing Coal Ball Factory Office, May 2nd.</p>
