<h3>蔣委員長閉幕詞　應本實事求是之精神督促政府與全國國民　依各英決議切實施行</h3>
<p>重慶　第二屆國參會第一次大會、於十日閉幕、主席蔣中正致休會詞、原文如次、第二屆國民參政會第一次大會、今日圓滿閉幕、各位同人以十日之辛勤、努力對各種報告與提案成立充實完備之決議、政府必能依照實施、今後不僅作戰必獲一大進展、即對內對外亦可充分表現我全國國民始終團結之精神、此其影響於軍事外交、必更可獲致最大之勝利與成功、而爲本會同人所最感快慰者也、臨此閉會之日、於各同人行將散歸各地或海外之時、本席特將吾人今後努力應注重之要點、</p>
<p>寳貴應用　過去經騐</p>
<p>就感想所及、略爲陳述、須爲各位吿者、卽在此次大會以前之三年半中、吾人作戰之最大任務、在以舉國一致之强固精神、打擊暴力、以奠立國家勝利之基礎、至此次會議以後、一切抗建事業之進行、山於內外大勢而益感緊要、成敗利鈍、關係更大、吾人除注重精神而外、更須特別注重於各部門具體之行動與一切工作、事實之表現、允其對過卡經騐與敎訓、應實貴應用、凡事　須實事求是、以求逐步推進、更必須政府人民致戒愼恐懼、而不可有一事之敷衍與虛誇、更宜絕對犧牲黨派或個人利害之見、强與蘇聯英美各友邦之聯絡、而本會對於外交國策之始終擁護、必能完全達成我抗建之目的、以言政治、中國過去政治上最大缺點、即在於尙宣言而不務力行、故每屆會　之後、一切宣貢決　多成　論、政治之所以廢她泄沓、以此爲體大之原因、此次本會休會之後、即由全體同人本實事求是之精神、督促政府與全國國民依照本會決　切實　行、</p>
<p>在大會休會期間、各位駐會姿員自必本其職權、隨時協助政府、更希望我全體同人在各地方同樣促使人民協助政府、使一切設施咸能迅速確實努力推進、則我政治上今後必更獲日異月新之　步、</p>
<p>貫澈軍令　整飭紀律</p>
<p>以言軍事作戰實力經政府努力補充、已足塡補在作戰中之犧牲消耗、且已超過戰前一倍以上、抗建前途已確有滕利把握、今後唯一關鍵，即在貫澈軍令、整飭軍紀、如軍令能貫澈、軍紀能整飭、則最後勝利爲期必不在遠、此點本席曾屢次言之、今　所希望於本會同人者、端在倡導全國國民、確認戰時紀律之絕對重要性、督促政府協助政府嚴格　飭軍紀、貫澈軍令、以完成抗建使命、以言經濟、此爲本屆大會所量關切之問題、實亦爲今後成敗存亡之所繫、如能解決戰時經濟問題、同時完成經濟建設、則勝利前途、卽獲確切之保障、本會同人此次對於經濟方面之提案與決議、均屬切實而重要、相信政府必能切實執行、而允盼各位能一致協助、不僅對目前糧食物品交通運輸等問題、隨時硏究其利弊、貢獻實際材料與意見、求得圓滿解決、而允富注意於國家根本之經濟建設、吾人不僅應使戰時經濟基礎絕對鞏固、且當使國防經濟建設確實元成、諸如開發物資、增進生產、促進國家工業化、更望倡導全國共同努力、</p>
<p>經濟建設　最關重要</p>
<p>最足使吾人回憶者、第一屆參政會同人對於促進國家武治經濟建設之實際貢獻、至爲偉大、即以川康建設期成會而言、舉凡今日川康兩省禁烟剿匪之成績、以及其他政治經濟之進步、大都由於期成會同人親赴各地、不避艱苦、以實力補助政府推行之結果、如能繼續不斷、始終一致、則本席相信川康兩省剿匪禁烟之工作、必能圓滿貫澈、而經濟建設與政治改造、亦必能有一日千里之進步、</p>
<p>再如前年本會同人參加軍風紀巡察事之工作、對於前方軍風紀之整頓、實有莫大之效果、此種躬行實踐之精神、甚望本屆同人繼續前功、使之發揚光大、値茲經濟作戰車要之時期、本會同人如能不避辛勞、對於全國交逾運輸事業、予以調查視察、以其所得、貢獻政府採納、則其裨益於抗建實無涯量、</p>
<p>總之、今日所　盼予本會同人者、即在諸君體國民屬望之殷、念及太身職責之重大、與政府當局親愛精神、和衷共濟以貢獻其精神能力於抗建、業、而完成本會所負歷史之使命、（十日電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>民治勝利的紀程碑</h3>
<p>由美國參衆兩院討論了兩個月之久的「租借法案」，終於以壓倒的票數，完全通過了。在現實國際局勢上，牠將保證而且促進中英希等民治國家的勝利到來；在人類文明前途上，牠將預告着民治主義的伸張，暴力專制制度的終要毀滅；而這次議案的本身及牠的成立過程，又正就是民治精神的產物，具體說明了牠的力量的偉大。假如我們把中國的持久抗戰，英國的孤軍禦暴，以及希臘的敢摟凶鋒，正是爲民治主義披荆斬棘，拓展坦途，則美國這次的舉措，就是達到勝利大道的重要紀程碑。</p>
<p>這一議案，經過兩個月的討論過程；民治國向來的行動格言是「緩慢然而確實」，這次美國的舉措裏，澈頭澈尾地滲透著這一種精神。在這期間，德義日等國，曾經做了種姿態，企圖威脅及誘惑美國放棄這個法案，而美國國內孤立派又曾多方阻撓並企圖打銷牠的成立，然而終於通過了。尤其値得往意的，羅斯福總統的政敵威爾基，始終放棄敵黨的偏見，對本案熱烈擁護；此外尙有許多反對本案的人士中，除了極少數或者仍然抱着頑固的成見外，也決定於本案成爲國策後，完全加以接受及遵守。所有這一切，都證明着民治制度下，公理及民意的壓倒力量，以及民治制度的效率。當眼前獨裁及暴力橫行一時的時候，這種民治精神的勝利業績，眞是非常値得寳貴而重視的。</p>
<p>當然，現在站在第一綫上，爲民治主義作生死搏鬥的國家，毫無疑義的，還是中英希等國。美國這一法案所援助的對象，也就是這些國家；最終的目的，是幫助民治國戰勝。按照本案，美國幾乎表明了決心用任何方法，去貫澈目的。把美國完全化爲「民治國家的兵工廠」，便是最初的，亦是最低限度的一個項目，從此以後，美國將動員了所有資源與力量，大批趕造戰具；而其方式與意義，却不是爲了獲利，不是爲了貿易，故小是買賣而完全是「租借一，是援助」。牠的最後範圍，甚至也不僅僅限於美國一國的資源，凡是美國勢力所能運用的地方，像中美南美等處，終將同屬這個「兵工廠」的體系，而成爲全體民治國家作戰的後方兵站。更進一步觀察，美國對於東西兩組大戰裏的實際地位，法埋上雖沒有參戰，不是交戰國，但實際上，可謂已經以武器參戰方式，部份的參了戰。在此認識之下，美國今後應不僅以供給中英希等國以戰具，表示其爲第三國的同情爲滿足，殆將積極替所有民治國家的獲勝條件及方略，作一通盤策劃；而設立所謂「最高機關」，便以通盤策劃爲其最大使命吧！據所傳聞，從中國回去的寇利氏，與從英國回去的霍浦金氏，皆將羅致在這一機構之中，正是爲了要澈底明瞭中英兩國當前的需要及實際情形，以決定牠的援助種類及數量。這樣情形卞，美國已經不獨是各民治國家的「兵工廠」，而同時也是物力上的强大後備軍。照實際情形看來，美國這次法案成立過程中，關於軍火的輸運問題，佔着非常重要地位；而討論表決的結果，僅僅揷進了這樣一條規定：這個法案，「並不暗合着已經授權政府，尤許美國船隻得以在交戰區內運送軍火」；而孤立派所提出絕對禁止美國船隻駛進交戰區的提案，却受到了吾決；相形之下，可以視爲美國船隻的參加運送軍火，保留了最大可能性。萬一德義日三國宣佈封鎖或阻擋軍火的運輸，那時美國當然要排除這類妨碍，而演成正面衝突的危機。就隨時隨地存在着了。所以根據這次法案，現在美國的參戰與吾，僅僅是一個次要的形式問題，牠的最要緊的一點，却是用盡一切可能方法，覓取及保證民治國家的勝利。</p>

<h3>工部局董事競選　日僑已感冷淡　須知西人佔有多數選舉　縱事競爭無法達到欲望</h3>
<p>四月二日與三日工部局舉行董事年選時、日僑將有何種行動、今日（十一日）仍未可知、因納稅日人保持緘默故也、董事年選日期、距今已不遠、聞日僑尙未作日董候選人之初選準備、英僑方面聞將於下週初舉行預選、俾便推定英董候選人、美僑則已推定阿樂滿與明思德兩人、參與董事年選、若干入士相信納稅日人深知納稅西人佔有絕大多數選舉票、日僑不能達其增加工部局日董之願望、故對工部局董事年選、已感冷淡、</p>
<h3>法租界因燃料缺乏　實行節減電力　對新設備或充概不接受　並研究如何節省界內電銷</h3>
<p>公共租界上海電力公司、以燃料缺乏、經工部局多方計劃、通吿自五日起、實行减電百分之三十、並對新增用戶、予以拒絕、法租界水電公司雖以其所用燃料、均爲柴油、未即採取平行行動、但以遠東局勢之不寗、致柴油來源、較前亦感困難、故與法公董局多次商議後、業已決定實施减少消費第一步辦法、自即日起、對用戶供電之要求、一律不予接受、其他措置、則尙在考慮之中、</p>
<p>電力電熱　停止新戶</p>
<p>昨日法公董局督辦譚鴣啼會發表關於此事之公吿，其內容如下、「爲通吿事、照得現以燃料缺乏補充困難、本局合特通吿公衆知悉、法商電車電光公司、對於電力或電熱之電流供給、無論其爲新設備或擴充現有設備等請求、將概不接受之、而本局現並請該公司務在最短期內、除應顧慮及於現有設備之用途外、即行研究如何節省租界內之　銷、仰各週知、此佈、督辦譚鴣啼、一</p>
<p>柴油來源　較前困難</p>
<p>法商水電公司總大班法佛萊氏昨吿記者稱、水電公司全部發電機器、自開辦迄今、即爲燃用柴油、現以來源較前困難、補允不易、且爲預防將來如有更形困難之情形起見、已決定暫採限制新用戶之供電委求辦法、至於减電問題、現公司方面已開始調查硏究、一俟有所決定、卽予公吿實行、但對燃科供給困難之具體悄形則法氏未予發表</p>
<p>節减辦法　正在研究</p>
<p>又據該公司業高級職員昨對記者稱、該公司近組織一委員會、考慮如何節减法租界內工業及商菜用電流供給問題、一俟該委員會研究竣事、則該公司即將起草一附有建議案之報吿書、送交法公董局核准、頒佈施行、</p>
<p>對工商業　影響甚微</p>
<p>但據靈通方面消息稱、法租界水電公司每月需用之柴油以　原為二千噸、但最近以來源不易、已　至一千五百噸、法租界採取限制用電之原因、卽在於此、聞該公司現有存油、向可供三個月以上之消耗、而本市存油數量、亦尙衆多、故目前決恐無慌、又聞法租界去年度消費軍量爲六千七百萬度、本年以來、每月平均六百　度、較公共租界爲少、蓋以規模較大之工廠及商行、大多在公共租界之故、故法租界即使實行减電、對工商業之影響、亦較輕微、</p>
<h3>昨日撤滬美僑　僅百餘人</h3>
<p>美郵船批船士總統　、前晨由菲港來滬、停泊十二十三號浮筒、各淸已誌前報，該郵船已於昨晚七時半離滬返美、此次本市曁內地美僑、乘該輪回國者、昨據該公司宣稱、祗一百零五人、惟該輪客位已滿、下班搭虎脫總統號、客位聞亦已預定一空、</p>

<p>法律處本年度預算、草案計列三六三·二九〇元、嗣總修正後、改列四一一·一四〇元、比上年度增出一九八·四七〇元、所以增加之原因、比各處情形大抵相同、</p>
<h3>滬市繼續推行　日光節約運動　自本月十五日午夜實行</h3>
<p>滬市於去夏推行日光節的運動、租界當局曁各公私團體、通力合作、步趨一致、對於激發朝氣、鍛鍊體魄、增進工作效能、均著成效、茲悉本年仍定繼續推行、據工部局情報處公告、茲經本局與法租界公董局會同決定、自本月十五日（星期六）午夜起、開始日光節的運動、屆時各時計將按照上年辦法、一律撥快一小時、切盼各界市民與公私團體、對於此項最有利於公　之辦法、一體遵行、</p>

<h3>論集錦照相（續）</h3>
<p>— 郎靜山</p>
<p>宇宙景物，森羅萬象，其中有使人喜好者，亦有使人憎惡者，惟皆出乎造化之自然，所謂萬物並育，目不能因人之好惡而存棄之。故吾國歷來畫家之作畫，雖寫一地之實景，而未嘗作刻板之描摩，類皆取其所喜而棄其所惡者，以爲其理想境界，而不遠大自然之正常現象耳。照相則受機械之限制，於攝底片時不能於全景中，而去其局部，且往往以地位不得其宜，則不能得適當角度，如近景太近，則遠景被掩薇，遠景太遠，則不足以襯托近景，常因局部之不佳而破壞全面，殊爲遺憾。今集錦照相適足以補救之，亦即吾國書家之描摩自然景物，隨意取舍移置，而使成一完突之畫幅也。且取景鏡頭，實甚呆板，不能與吾人視覺所得之印象相比，故每攝一景，多爲平視透視，而吾國繪畫則兼有鳥瞰透視，雖於畫法中未有顯明之記述，而實與人目所得之印象同，故其遠近淸晰，層次井然。集錦照相，亦本此理，於尺幅中可佈置前景，中景，遠景，使其　　複雜，幽深雄奇，匪獨　趣權溢，且可得　優之透視也。</p>
<p>若以圖面之章法而論，景物之賓主揖　，開闔本原，驅使行列，均須各得其宜，於人自然景物中一切分佈固有其天然法則。但若取其一部入於小幅中，當不能盡，故每得此而失彼，集錦照相，乃將所得之局部，加以人　而組合之，使成完璧，此即吾國繪晝之所謂經營位置者也。然須以雕琢而復歸於白然，方能出神入化，巧奪天工。</p>
<p>集錦照相於材料之收集，可不限於地，不限於時，不限遠近，不限氣候，隨遊踪所至，任情攝取之，一花一木，一水一石，皆足爲集錦照相製作時之資料，惟於攝取時須作敏捷之計劃耳。即何者宜於前景，何者官於中景，何者宜於遠景，何者足爲主題，何者可還襯托，皆須一一略爲定奪，按計劃收取之，冲晒以後，再詳爲訂定。於製作時，先將欲集爲一幅之底片檢出，就其景物形勢，光綫角度等，排比成章，再將欲放映之尺寸大小，於一幅厚紙上，以鉛筆作一草圖，詳爲斟酌景物之位置及互相掩映之姿態。草圖旣成，遂準備放缺手械，臨放映時，預將草圖置於待放映之　紙上，以試底片景物，是吾與草圖所擬者符合，試後依次放映之，每放映片，須用草圖校對一次，使其精確。惟作者須手術純熟，工作敏捷，並須有全部之成竹在胸，　能得心應手也。</p>
<p>集錦照相於組合時所當注意者，即每組底片之景物，角度須相等，光綫須同向，物體之大小須依透視徘列之，景物之時序，亦須顧及。耍之一切均須以人目所得於自然之印象相符合，吾　失眞，致弄巧反拙矣。至於光綫同向，係指有强烈之陽光陰影而言，若天氣陰晦，光綫平渾而無過黑道白之光影，則只酌量其情形接合即得，蓋此種圖面亦無從訂定其光綫之方向也。而此種底片實爲最適宜於接合之材料，較有强烈之光影者爲易於接合耳。　（未完）</p>

<h3>糧食　囤老虎心無足　貼價橫跳五六百元　不痴不聾難做阿家翁囤戶膽大　橫漲豎漲漲得更兇險不怕不買</h3>
<p>洋米在投機氣氛籠罩下、人戶猶小斷壟斷、欲望其逐步回鬆、殊為不可能之事、新到雖多、然盡係定貨者獲利之目的物、存積之夥、乃爲囤積者發財之工具、故欲期望現貨之儘量出售與市價之回平、誠有與虎謀皮之不易實現、囤戶不畏輿論、蓋以輿論不能制栽其囤積也、而有此力量者、則所謂不痴不聾、難做阿家翁、故囤戶之氣燄更甚、且國米旣遭搜刮、近又在市上搜羅洋米、大囤戶倚若長城、大演雙簧、但恐其不如此、豈顧及數百萬人無食、昨早晨開市、形勢立即緊張、暗盤貼價比前日橫跳五六百元、謠言紛起、人心惶惑、逐抬逐高，越喊越貴，小絞每百包貼價又目二千二三百元抬到二千六七百元、西貢一號自二千二三百元大到二千七八百元、又一二號及火絞自二千二百元至二千四百元、連到貧民果腹之碎米亦自一千一二百元大到一千三五百元之鉅、全日交易因客囤兩貪成交又達二萬包以上、</p>
<p>國米市自前朝突吿回跌後、昨則猶呈軟態、蓋處此價格轟頂、變化劇烈，所以早市開手、無論本鄉店胃、及一般散戶、不的而同均惟旁觀待機、當時銷塲懈淡異常、市况有冉度暴跌之象、詎意一般貨主、懷抱獨異、因見到貨續稀、且聞洋米暗盤回昂、不以銷滯改其初衷、售意甚堅、未肯驟鬆、致雙方背道而馳、一路相持、成交寥寥、直迨近午、市塲公吿今日總理逝世紀念休業一天、備恐來源積夥、而若身骨軟弱之薄稻、遇此天時寒暖不常、晴雨莫測、不耐擱置、易起變化、方始略貶脫售、乃結果薄稻行情見落元砠、開靑角斛見貨爲一百十九元至一百十八元、原包一百二十二元、然如厚粳猶能支住回呈定局、開價與前相仿、其崑山斛見白　、仍爲一百二十一二元、原包一百二十六元半、一百二十六元、常幫斛見特白粳一百二十四五元、糯米市貨旣稀、且有　戶繼在囤積、去路　廣、喊聲迭起、若香港普通團粒糯已自一百元開至一百零二元、畏粒並抵百元至九十九元、中次者亦須九十七八元、較之前市又提一二元不等、而特別高貨竟吿悉無出樣、至於糯菉昨有開出、達九十一元半至九十元、</p>
<h3>投機猖狂粉市塲　暫停交易　平賣粉照常供應　洋麥有大宗到滬</h3>
<p>現洋粉市場、　告停頓、蓋以近日投機買風、猖獗異常、市面激漲過烈、當局爲本市民食起見、暫禁市塲交易、在風疾走之粉市、頓時寂靜無聲、聞塲外直接配貨、雖經當局誥誡、售價尚站高峯、惟業外囤戶、見勢不佳、頗有暗中出籠、價已鬆至三十元關內、華廠平賣粉已照常供給、批出八千三百十八包、除福新廠供給五千八百七十三包外、其餘　以洋粉搭配、售價每包一十五元、另加車雜費二角云、</p>
<p>麥市交易、更屬停頓之象、國內外供源均稀、已到之洋麥、正爲華廠製造平賣粉之需、市塲杜麥、早已枯竭、欲購無貨、市面不脫呆擯之局、</p>
<p>洋麥人批來滬、福來洋行經埋之（Aatartia）號輪、由澳洲裝洋麥二千噸、的二萬餘包、昨晨進口、停靠公和祥碼頭起卸、又聞賚賜洋行代理之（LLLinois）號輪、由加拿大運來大量洋麥、的有六千噸之鉅、約合六萬餘包、預計該輪今今晨可到、該項麥子聞係福新麵粉廠所採購、</p>
<h3>雜糧　拉抬雜糧　絕不放鬆</h3>
<p>昨日雜糧油餅市面、除黃豆續跌外、其他因囤戶壁壘堅硬、猶未放鬆、以致市價節節高抬、中　雖有迂迴小挫、但仍漲多跌少、計豆油漲二元左右、開成期現大連油一千二三百桶、廠油四五百担、豆餅漲一二角、做開各牌餅七千餘片、苞米漲四五角、交易現貨三千餘包、期貨六百餘噸、照成交數尚屬可觀、然實銷祗占三分之一、刻下大局全由投機家支持、不過皮球交易日見其繁、將後終有一日球量過重、難以踢出之時也、</p>
<p>豆子十一日進口、有二百包自香港來、十二日出口、有豆子五百五十包運新加坡、豆餅六百二十塊、運暹羅、芝蔴一百包運新加坡、</p>
<h3>金融　外滙忐忑　華商出而復進</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛脾、悉無上落、英美匯暗市，鬆後復見回軟、顯示經營者忐忑小定、至華商投機家仍多售出、並以外銀行吸胃頗厚、華行亦有相當購納、故供求時見平衡、晨開後美匯本月份做五元五六二五、午收卒回、且反吿軟化、後市先平後俏、晚收現美匯爲五元半、先令一辦士　七五，比上日英匯平美滙長〇三一二五、期貨亦然、</p>
<p>午刻稍形轉緊</p>
<p>晨　以倫教條、近遠期均平、紐的銀價仍平、倫敦生余呆定、匯兌英對美滬等不動、美對英縮二五、對滬人一分、對法無市、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行農開現賣價、英金三辦士三七五、美匯五元五三一二五、俱與上日收市價相同、開後市面帶鬆、緣華商投機家已來賣出　月份美匯、由華行上海華僑等吸入、價五元五六二五、九點半匯豐掛牌揭曉不動、白銀平衡稅無上落、此後投機商續塞、而某美行及有　亦來購納、三月份美匯依然做五元五六二五、迨至十時半後、人心稍轉、賣風已息、市面回軟、迄午及現貨美滙已吿五元半、先令三辦士三七五、</p>
<p>華商需要較殷</p>
<p>後市投機商初又售出、惟數額甚微、價微硬化、三月份美匯由華行收入價五元五三一二五、嗣全晚刻、華行等需要較殷、潛勢仍軟、結果現貨及本月份英匯吿三辦士三七五、美匯五元半、四月份英匯三辦士三五九三七五、美匯五元四六八七五、比上日收市價、美匯期現各緊〇三一二五、英匯則平、</p>

<h3>掉期日近　金市盤旋帶堅</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗盤、已見回漲、一度升近六千三百元大關邊、仍不脫聞旋局勢、各方人心暫懷觀望、乃國內外消息均少明朗化、且本週五爲三月轉入四月掉期日、利多利空尚在不定中、自晨開後之一小時半、聞於六千二百四五十元之間、一度退見六千二百三十元、及聞美滙因日商洋行扒結突轉緊、且上日力售之恒記成記德孚忽來猛進、大豐復購、逐見飛上至六千二百九十元、午收前稍見挫落、下午美金稍回硬、價一度挫落、但證券幫不斷收吸、重見上升、盤於六千二百七十元左右、終見軋升三十元、全日交易共一萬六七千兩、現金永豐餘出十兩、德孚出二十兩、均祥和買進、照期交價高四百五十元、下午時和出祥和一百兩、高四百四十元、飾金升十元、爲二百九十元、關金等均平、</p>
<p>烚赤好起卅元</p>
<p>晨初人心觀望、檯面買賣相抵、價極平穩、開聞爲六千二百四十元、與上日收聞價無異、開後德孚力進、升至六千二百五十五元、終聞外滙首報驟硬、大豐等傾塞、勢乃吿撳、一度跌至六千一百三十元、此後盤旋良久、而滙市轉軟、人心略振、德孚再吸、成記大豐恒記等莫不撈入、於是向上、挺至六千二百九十元、此後交易已淸、恒記吐出、壓低十元、達六千二百八十元，午收　堅、吿六千二百八十六元、午後開盤平平、爲六千二百八十五元、於供求相平中、微升一元、爲六千二百八十六元、奈大豐及同康永頻來塞出、不支、復向上游、退至六千二百五十五元、　又回高至六千二百七十元、斯時盤旋父多、最好至六千二百七十八元、因賴新豐永大豐德孚購入所致、晚收結果吿六千二百七十元、比上日軋升三十元、全日上落六十元、照三月份美金五元半結價爲六千三百三十一元八角、計撳六十一元八角、現金號本牌金售價較烚赤（　貨）高四白五十元、收進低十元、現標金均無做開</p>
<p>飾金掛大十元</p>
<p>銀樓飾金每兩兌出價、上午十二時升十元、以後不動、計大同行掛六百九十元、新同行與上價相仿、收滙低四十元云、</p>
<h3>外幣所漲尙微</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、因烚赤盤旋趨漲、英美金鎊卒吿上漲一元，英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票在狹小範圍內聞旋、最後仍爲十七元九角半，香港票略趨堅挺、晚市爲四元四角四分、日金票又趨漲勢、晚市高至一元八角九分、朝鮮票供求均勻、市價站平、晚市仍站一元五角半原盤、</p>
<h3>中央銀行今日休假　銀錢業照常營業</h3>
<p>今日寫總理逝世紀念日、中央銀行及中央信託局循例休假一天、上海銀行業聯合準備會、昨特通函各交換銀行、關於該行及該局今日應收應付　據均改明日提出交換、至於其他銀錢兩業會員行莊、及洋商銀行、均照常營業云、</p>
<h3>證劵　公債漲風不衰</h3>
<p>公債　盤、昨日市况漲　猶水見　、在同康等　賣中、市價仍係冉冉上騰、惟甲　吃戶漸見踴躍，幷有出內進甲者、亦頗不乏人、蓋以甲與丙之相距離向係十元爲標準、有時差至十一二元者、最近月餘夾相差祗七元數角至八元之　、久之忽爲人所注意及之、乃羣起掉換、但目下相差仍祇八　四角、而况甲種貨少期短、爲其他各債所小及、市况趨勢觀同康一家賣出有一百餘萬之多、而市價不小、可見潛勢仍係好面、不過暫時稍受委屈、而甲種漲風獨勁、幷非意外、在順昌仁昌仁豐等紛紛搜　中、此種上漲、比丙種不爲過份、信孚仍有買進、餘如鴻大聚豐震康恒孚協興源等、亦均係買進、鼎康天元益記人通大華均係賣出、而市上仍係求供於供、故結果一律上漲　角至一元有奇、成父的共二百七八十萬元、茲列簡明表於伐、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交中國銀行股二百股、價為九十三元五角、</p>
<p>衆業股市穩靜已極、價格幾無上落、實業股成交不多、業廣與中營二地產公司股價稍上漲、橡皮股脚地尚佳、</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗多空　勢均力敵</h3>
<p>紗市復人廻旋之境、此因實際交易依然寥寥無幾、兼之外滙寗靜，人心雖則看升、然新買者未見發展也、至於證券　及金子幫、鑒於連日標金趨勢向下、外匯寗靜、因之大都傾向拋出、惟同業中心思多數吸進望好、所以雙方勢均力敵也、二十支雙馬高價一千三百八十二元、低價一千三百七十三元、午後初做一千三百八十二元、跌至三百七十六元、最　價爲一千三百七十七·八元、今日有棉紗五百六十件運香港、九十五件運　羅、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、市面尚和善、首聞價爲一千三百七十元、旋因人心良好、逐步漲至一千三百八十二元、但金價開出平凡、外滙安定、人氣較爲鬆懈徐徐回、至一千三百七十三·五元間、此盤盤旋殊久、迨至收聞稍堅、爲一千三百八十元、查半日問成交統計六千二百〇五包、茲將各幫口買去之數量、分列如左、香港　一七〇　寗波　二五內地　一〇　同行六、〇〇〇統計六、二〇五</p>
<h3>美棉飛漲　本棉稍稍帶起</h3>
<p>現棉情况、稍見開展、不過仍以細紗原料爲昂、念支棉市仍在平靜之境、</p>
<p>紐的棉市、因租借法案順利通過、及政府將提高貸款、同時華爾街股票亦挺進不已、於是人心興奮、熱烈買進、市况更趨活躍堅昂、結果收聞價格、較之上日高漲一十至三十磅音不等</p>
<p>印棉先因棉商套賣而跌、旋因紐的影響、投機者不斷買進而挺進、且漲勢甚昂、故昨日連日預測上昇六羅比半、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、良以國際情勢展開明朗、連日美棉飛漲不已、而本市現紗亦逐步趨漲、是故人心已有活動之意向、昨日小額成交尚稱熱鬧、雖廠方尚無大量採購、但市况已趨活潑而堅定之狀態也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　廠布開出稀少　手貨售價亦緊</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市續堅、乃緣客銷略有進展、同業與囤戶心思交易、頗形旺盛、廠方期貨開售甚稀、同業手貨根子亦緊、故售盤均趨昂貴、白貨怡和粗布每疋漲二角牛、各廠細布斜紋漲二角半至七角半·申新等廠開出三月份細布斜紋共的四百餘件、本街成交粗細布漂染布等五百餘件、浙東溫甬幫辦人鵬富貴細布怡和粗布色布色　　一百數十件、閩幫辦斜紋色布悄綢等四五十件、粵港幫辦十林藍布色斜等貨三百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　先平後漲、形　續挺、白貨龍頭細布下午聞每疋四十七元二角半、四君子嗶嘰每碼一元三角四分、</p>
<p>出口　疋頭——二日出口、九百九十五件運香港、三十五件運新加坡、二百三十七件運暹遲、</p>
<h3>絲茶　輯里絲上漲獨鉅</h3>
<p>幾日來本埠絲市、殊稱沉悶、咋日各洋莊絲行略有交易、唯爲數甚小、計白廠絲　〇——二二條絲七十八份勻度售　五千一百五十元、——五份勻度售開四千九百元、輯里特絲四千四百元、六號四千一百元、較之上週、的漲百元許、且以輯里經上漲爲最、至其上漲原因、　部爲絲經　能來滬之故、故瞻望絲價前途、大有再漲可能、</p>
<h3>煤炭　熟煤增高十元</h3>
<p>熟煤行情、自烟煤步漲以後、人心望上、初則把持不售、近雖有少數出籠、價已喊上十元、同業行拆、塊煤每噸兩百二十元、棧房自車、送到另加車力、本街門莊零售、每担十三元云、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價平定</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢略見微鬆、僅小一二角而已、公會劃聞、現貨二四粗白外棧七十九元九角至八十元、三月二十日打單八十元零二角至一角、三月底打單初爲八十元四角、旋至五角、後仍回至四角、太古車白B嘜八十元四角至五角、BY嘜七十九元、其餘乏市、</p>
<h3>南北貨　金山元枝續昂</h3>
<p>金山　枝、來源寥寥、而成本以港匯關係、逐步加昂、故號盤因亦開漲十餘元、而至二百餘元、惟扁枝以去化較狹、反見平落、雜路枝亦僅平定而已、</p>

<h3>家麟貸學金主人　朱肖琴君自述（三）</h3>
<p>同業之經理人、往往兼任洋行事務、非徒爲一己添收入、蓋營業上有指臂之繫也、予先後兼任順亨公和寳生等洋行跑街之職、遇交涉事、每爲主客雙方計、期得其平、而主客者、輙各趨極端、與予意大相徑庭、故不久即辭去之、</p>
<p>民國十四年、遽遭大故、予旣爲先君營葬畢、復於海寗城內廟宮西畔、鑿自流井一口、深數十丈、圍三數抱、名曰綠琴公井、蓋先君遺命也、同時予復鑿雙節井於縣屬硤石鎭、爲紀念先胞姑母以貞女歸韓氏、及其嗣媳之苦節、亦先君遺意也、先君爲人、性直好義、壽七十四、</p>
<p>予經營大同源數載、增資擴充、日見蒸蒸、至民國十九年、根底旣深、信譽亦著、不知事有出乎意料者、乃禍起蕭牆、遭不貲之損、而益以一二八之變、情勢日非、急從事收束、五年而歇業、蓋爲人計、爲已計、均不欲至無可收拾地也、</p>

<h3>大爺有錢</h3>
<p>— 徐祤</p>
<p>大爺說：「錢者，開路先鋒也。」</p>
<p>一個人要是有了「開路先鋒「，那麼儘管世道怎樣崎嶇，社會又怎樣可怕，到後來萬事莫小化吉，縱然你鬧出了什麼亂子，也定能迎刃而解。</p>
<p>例如我們的大爺，一生縱橫天下，靠着他通天妙術，「開路先鋒」投到他的麾下來的，何止幾千萬？叉賴他一調遺有方」，一路殺來，勢如破竹，有人說他是位人生戰塲上的「福將」，我想這是再合格也沒有的了。</p>
<p>那一年，大爺一時高興，跟某舞女發生了關係，那知道這狗婆娘不識相，倒眞的要跟大爺認起夫婦來了。於是大爺一聲吆喝，「開路先鋒」馬上衝了過去，不一刻，風平浪靜，大爺得意洋洋，凱旋而歸！</p>
<p>大爺旣負有此「奇才」，做起事米，自非一般庸人所能比其萬一。譬如賺錢——人生第一大事，普通人便不能及之分毫。他只要一個電話，花花緣綠的鈔票便跳進來一萬！較之你我這般笨伯，終日埋着頭流着汗，做一世恐怕也沒有這數目。</p>
<p>「千金散盡還復來」，這是李太白的詩句，也就是大爺最信任的「哲學」。他常常說：「我眞不能瞭解一般愚人，節的儲蓄有什麽用？等到人一死便什麼都完了，何况賺錢又是挺容易的事！』所以論到他的「犧牲」精神，實在也頗驚人，而大爺之所以能成「福將」者，也就在這裏。</p>
<p>只要能賺得「開路先鋒」來，那末調遺開路先鋒」也就不必担憂，因之，世事也便會「逢兇化吉」，做人也可做得「最有意思」·——至少大爺常常是道樣想的。</p>
<p>數十年來的際遇，證　他的懷抱，並沒有受過打擊，於是現在的大爺，是更慷慨於調遺「開路先鋒」，更堅持於他的「最合理」的「信仰」。（而且，現在不比從前，招募先鋒」是更「容易」的事了！）</p>
<p>大爺對於心理學也挺有硏究，他以爲凡是愚人必愛錢，而世界上最多的，便是愚人！他又以爲凡是愛錢的，必沒有錢：而沒有錢的，就頂容為做他的「開路先鋒」的敗將。</p>
<p>所以，大爺一見到窮人，就挺瞧不上眼；一瞧不上眼，心裏使常常想：『大爺有錢　哼，你是什麽東西！』於是走起路來，便搖搖擺擺了。</p>
<p>搖呀搖的，大爺搖過了××路轉角，忽然一個小三子迎了上來：</p>
<p>『大爺，賜福呀，餓哪……」</p>
<p>臭而醜的東西！大爺撩起脚，猛的一腿。哈哈，小三子打了一個筋斗。</p>
<p>事情閙殭了，角落裏的一個粗漢衝了上來，聲勢兇極，『是我的孩子，你敢——』</p>
<p>說着，伸出了拳頭：大而粗！</p>
<p>大爺一見形勢不佳，馬上伸手淮袋口，心想「開路先鋒」出來，難道還不退兵嗎？嘴邊吊出來一句「大爺有錢」……</p>
<p>但是冷不防對方的拳頭已經湊了過來，淸脆的剛打在大爺的左頰上，『誰希罕你這臭錢！」</p>
<p>大爺也翻了一個筋……</p>
<p>人爺瞪着滿皮夾的鈔票，也畢竟感到了一些空虛。</p>
<p>想小到世閒竟也有不愛錢的「賤坯」！</p>
<h3>偶拾</h3>
<p>— 文牆</p>
<p>（二）船裝水</p>
<p>某輪船公司近日因生意淸淡，無貨色可以裝運。但是船隻仍照常駛往外國，行駛在大洋中的船隻，因無貨色，船身重量减少，顛簸不定，不得已只得將船隻滿裝了水。</p>
<p>有人說：這是怪事！</p>
<h3>找「保」記</h3>
<p>— 易人</p>
<p>好容易，東找西尋，費了九牛二虎之力，找到了一個運輸公司的小職員位置；但是，要有「殷實舖保」哪！對於我這個沒有富親貴友的寒酸小子，這實在是一個最難的難題。但是爲了吃飯問題，只得厚着面皮，鼓起勇氣，去試騐我的幸運。</p>
<p>第一個去訪的是母校的校長，說明了來意後，他就大兜其圈子，說現時上海的局勢如何不好，他做校長如何的困難，因此他說早　摒絕一切作保及應酬交際。他似乎覺察到我失望的態度，就連連的說很同情我，但是他說沒有方法幫忙。</p>
<p>第二個去訪的是一個遠房的堂叔，他是很有錢的，並且在上海商界上亦頗有地位；但是當我去的時候，他說他早已登出啟事，概不替人作保，因此他認爲亦無能爲力。</p>
<p>跑了整整一天，帶回的只是疲乏與失望。</p>
<p>第二天，帶了失望的步伐，再去找一個同鄕。他是一個有錢的「寓公」，在戰前頗爲活動，目前過着極安逸的生活。他知道我的來意後，便娓娓地述着一個故事：他怎樣擔保一個人到××錢莊做事，那個人怎樣「撒濫汚」，他怎樣吃賠賬，因此他謝絕作保。無論我怎樣說明我的職位不是會計，不是出納，僅是庶務，而他却總是小絕地「對不起」。</p>
<p>走出了這位先生的門，心裏眞是憤恨到極點。便去訪一個一起畢業的在××書局服務的同學。我的目的是去閒談解愁，而不是找他作保，因爲，我知道他沒有「保人」的資格，他只是一個小職員。但是他知道了我的事情後，便硬要替我作保，並且敎我去試試看。</p>
<p>我惶恐的持了道位同學的保證書，去謁見公司的經理。出於意料之外，他竟核准了我的保證人。於是我使開始工作了。</p>
<p>「天下無如吃飯難」，當我伏在寫字檯上開始工作的時候，我不禁輕輕的唸着。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（五）　愛與慾的分野</p>
<p>當他見到羅湘綺的時候，只談了十幾分鐘的功夫，他就覺這正是一個完全合符他意思的女人了。當日回到天津飯店之後，足足有一晚沒有睡，不斷的想她。可是她的影子在腦海裹實在太模糊了，始終不能想像出一個淸楚的輪廓來，好像就在眼前，但又像是在數千里外的遠處，正和人們閉上了眼睛，打算想像出家裹一個最親密的人的容貌來，而所得的却只是許多糢糊的零碎的印象一樣。</p>
<p>「她的臉龐是長形的還是圓形的啊？」他仰臥在榻上，望着一盞强烈的電燈出神；羅湘綺的臉龐是長的，還是圓的，他也記不淸楚了！</p>
<p>當他在想慕她的時候，趙玉崑打傷沈麻子，以及那些混混們的纏擾，差不多已經完全不再留存在他腦神經裏了，祇有一點是使他萬萬不能忘記的，那就是羅湘綺現在的身分。</p>
<p>「她是三爺的姨太太，我又多少受過」一爺的好處，况且又有糾文的關係夾雜在裹面，我怎麽能够想他呢？」他在很興奮的失眠狀態下，一再這樣竭力自制着。</p>
<p>但有什麼用呢？愛到了眞要宣洩的時候，它的力量是決不會比將耍爆發的火山緩和的！第二天下午，秋海棠又和羅湘綺在袁公館的會客室裏見面了。</p>
<p>「你覺得唱戲的生活怎麽樣？」湘綺用很簡短的語句，吿訴秋海棠胡督軍已答應給他幫忙之後，便用着不很關切的神氣問。</p>
<p>秋海棠昂起了頭，望着牆壁上掛的一張袁鎭守使的照相笑了一笑。</p>
<p>「完全像傀儡一樣！」答復得非常爽脆。</p>
<p>羅湘綺的視錢父再度在秋海棠的衣領以下繞了兩個圈子，心裏不由覺得更詫異起來；道個年輕人的身上，爲什麽一些找不出唱戲的人的氣息呢？　（五二）</p>
<h3>紀念</h3>
<p>— 覺慧</p>
<p>紀念不僅是紀念，紀念要在紀念以外去找！</p>
<p>譬如說：今天總理逝世第十六週年，就一定有那麼多底人來紀念。</p>
<p>味良心，飽私慾，把貧民逼迫得「入地無門，上天有路，」於是聳坐乎米堆之上以紀念總理……誠「嗚呼哀哉」</p>
<p>總理死，可哀；然總理精神不死，心不死，所以値得一切對得住總理的人來紀念。</p>
<p>人的「心死」，已輕是「哀莫大」了；如果心「活」者而無惡不作，則更「哀莫大」也！</p>
<p>「心死」，當然不配來紀念總理；心活」　無惡不作者，更不配！</p>
<p>紀念不僅是紀念，紀念要在紀念以外去找。紀念以外的是什麽？是良心！</p>

<h3>神秘的詹姆士史蒂華</h3>
<p>— 肇基</p>
<p>在好萊塢男明星中，有着最好的人緣便是這位還有些孩子氣的詹姆士史蒂華了。因為無論男明星願意同他做朋友，便是很多的女明星也很想接近他，脾氣古怪得像葛萊泰嘉買和瑪琳黛德麗也對他有相當的好感呢。</p>
<p>眞是奇怪。算年紀他已經在三十歲之外了，不過他看見了陌生人會忸怩作態顯出非常怕難為情的樣子，就是對方也常被他這種樣子弄得不安起來。有人說好萊塢明星中最怕羞的是賈萊古柏，不過賈萊還會應付一大串的客套，裝得　別客氣的神態，我們的史蒂華是連這類交際手段也不會的呢。</p>
<p>篇姆士史蒂華不但實際上是常常這樣的，就是在銀幕上所扮演的角色也是這副腔調。凡是看過「浮生若夢」和「民主萬歲」的人一定會對他這種老實而怕羞的表情好笑起來。他的這處表情不但給影迷們很深刻的印象，而且在全好萊塢男明星中恐怕只有他會做這類的戲呢。</p>
<p>但是好萊塢的女明星，誰者願意和他配戲，願意和他合演片子。其實，他又不是最漂亮的小生，不過他具有一種莫名的神秘性。他又不是絕對會演戲的天才演員，不過他却沒有做作，大情自然，絕不裝腔作勢，能够把一個誠實而忸怩的青年個性刻劃出來，好萊塢的人們常常喊着：「奇怪，為甚麼女人歡喜和詹米做朋友而且配演呢？奇怪！」</p>
<p>眞正的原因是誰也想不出而且說不出來的，不過詹姆士到現在的確還是個獨身　呀。</p>
<p>因秀在好萊塢誰都喜歡和他合演片子，所以像瑪格蘭落麗文，瓊克勞馥，琴逑變吉絲，宋雅海妮，卡洛朗白，琪恩亞瑟以及要麗娜鮑慧兒和羅賽琳洛珊兒等都和他合作過；不過倒不是女主角被人注意，而是史蒂華的神秘作風和典型演技壓倒了同他配演的女明星！在影城中，女人們是又愛他而又恨他！</p>
<p>去年，他同東山再起重上銀幕的顗珊玲赫本合演「菲城故事」，因其演技之優越而首次獲美國電影藝術學院金像獎。該片業已抵滬，目經試映，陣容非常堅强，由卡萊葛倫，約翰霍華，露絲赫珊，佛妮惠特等配演；導演則是大名鼎鼎「塊肉餘生」和「女人」的名導演喬治柯克氏。</p>
<h3>小歌星金溢</h3>
<h3>血雨瓊葩</h3>
<p>— 頋明道</p>
<p>第二章　朔方健兒好身手</p>
<p>張蒼虬哧的一聲笑了出來道：「你不要自己努力，時勢造英雄，英雄造時勢，元朝傾覆的時候，我太宗乘時崛起，豪傑影從。他不過是個皇覺寺裏的小和尙，却能平定天下。海水平可斗量，一個人的前途豈料得到呢？」許靖聽張蒼電說話好大口氣，不覺默然。張蒼虬也喝得有些醉意了，便敎盛飯。劉三送上飯來。張蒼虬又吃了三大碗，說道：「好多時候沒有吃米了，今天你們簡直把我待做上賓呢。」於是散了席。二人洗臉後，重人書室小坐。張蒼虬本要趕路的，不知怎樣的今天和許靖相見，惺惺相惜，大家取得甚是投機。許靖也因張蒼虬初見時似乎是個粗莽的武夫，但是說話却非常豪遇而又精警，是個風塵中的英雄，所以竭戾款接。二人談談說說，不覺日影　西，漸漸隠向山俊去了。張蒼虬道：「啊呀，多講了話，忘記了時候了，不知前面可有突處？俺想趕遇山去呢。」許靖道：「我們難得相逢，旣來之則安之，不嫌含間狹窗，請你在此擔擱一二天，再行動身如何？」張蒼虬道：「多蒙挽留，今晚俺就在府上住地一宵，明日再走吧。只是你們不要為了俺多心，祇要有酒渴便了，菜却不必預備的。」許靖道：「好，我家有的是酒，儘够你喝的。」張蒼虬遂到門外去把那頭鳥騅名馬牽進來，拴出籬內。對許靖帶笑說道：「俺這坐騎是很名貴的，俺要借着牠的力量趕路到山海關呢，不要給歹人看想了去。」許靖道：「現在外邊時勢雖不安寗，而我這地方却尙沒有刦掠盜竊之事，但是將來却難言了。」便吩咐劉三落空喂些馬料。二人就坐在庭中談些武藝。（五）</p>
<h3>奮鬥的人生觀</h3>
<p>— 宗預</p>
<p>一張一弛，文武之道，精神的張弛，並非食旦夕之安，求一時神經的麻木；而是調劑精神，使新精神加速的產生，以便再接再厲的向前奮鬥，因以延長奮鬥的時間至於無限。</p>
<h3>改良崑曲之我見</h3>
<p>— 宋瑞楊</p>
<p>大衆化的問題　我們不能否認，崑曲是太貴族化，太典雅了一點，非但唱詞是採取古典文學的形式，就是有許多說白，也是講究對仗聲韻的四六文章，使人聽了莫名其妙，此外更挨有多量的蘇州士白，外省人根本就聽不懂。所以我主張：第一，崑曲旣是純文學的化身，所以唱詞可以不加更動——並且牠是與特殊的樂調配合的，要改動也不可能，再退一步說，即使改成大衆化了，可是牠　不是「崑曲」了——惟一的補救辦法，只好由戲院主人印成唱詞，奉送觀衆，或以最低廉的價格售給觀衆，一面看字，一面聽曲，那就極容易懂了。其次，四六文章的說白，須一律改成迪俗的新口語，使人一錫就懂。再者，希望說白一律改說國音。同時崑曲是一個最富於仲縮性的劇團，牠可以上演於可容數千觀　的大舞台，也可以出現於小小客廳中的紅氍毺上，供極少數人的清賞，並且流動性最大，只要少數的角色，帶了極少數的「砌末」和樂器，便可以「出差了」。所以我主張多多組織旅行劇團，在大故鄉方各地往來演唱，和大衆接近的機會旣加多，牠也就愈易鳥大衆所接受，而一部分的宣傳工作感化工作也可以由他們分担去。</p>
<p>梅蘭芳俞　飛之「遊園驚夢」</p>
<h3>服裝和臉譜</h3>
<p>崑曲是哥歌舞劇，所以牠的袍，袖，帶，靴等都是圖案化，典型化，宜於看，便有助於舞蹈的；並且牠是搬演古事的　所以也不宜將固有的服飾完全廢去，不過有許多太不合理的地方應該加以修改。至於臉譜，鄭振鐸先生斥為「蠻性的復現」，我個人固然不主張舊劇臉譜是　種非常的藝術，可是我在某種條件下也認為有一部分是可以用來象徵劇中人之個性的，譬如凈角的粉臉用以代表奸雄，紅色濃眉之油光臉代表暴徒之類，我以為是可以保留的。至於以可怕的怪誔的顏色塗抹在臉上，造成紅色黑色金色等等似人非人似怪非怪的臉譜，就不敢領敎了。所以我以為只要用一點白粉黑墨和胭脂之類就足够了，以符古代「粉墨登塲」的說法。（明日續完）</p>

<h3>First Declaration of the Second National Political Council: Announcing to the National People with Recognition and Faith: China's Resistance and Nation-Building Has Achieved Spiritual Victory</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The National Political Council concluded its tenth session. The General Assembly issued an official statement as follows: "Declaration of the First Session of the Second National Political Council." On March 1st of this year, the First Session of the First National Political Council opened in Chongqing, the accompanying capital. All of us elected members, recognizing the severity of the national crisis, felt it our duty to contribute our intelligence. Therefore, except for those with actual obstacles, we all came to the meeting from all over the country and overseas. Out of a total of 127 members, 203 attended, the highest attendance rate in the history of the General Assembly. Colleagues convened according to law for ten days, accepted the policy reports from the various ministries and commissions of the National Government, deliberated on the government's internal and external guidelines for the 30th year submitted by the Executive Yuan, and a total of more than 150 proposals from colleagues on politics, military affairs, finance and economy, diplomacy, education, culture, disaster relief, and overseas Chinese affairs. Today, as the session concludes, colleagues should comprehensively report to the national compatriots on the common understanding and beliefs of this meeting. Therefore, in addition to individually publishing various resolutions, we make the following declaration: On the day the National Political Council was ordered to convene, our country's self-defense war had lasted for three years and seven months, and the European War had extended the Pacific situation, brewing drastic changes. Therefore, colleagues believe that the mission of this General Assembly is more important than previous gatherings of the First National Political Council, and it is even more necessary to first conduct a thorough review of whether the past resistance and nation-building policies and work are appropriate and effective. Then, based on the current world situation and the current situation between China and Japan, we must determine the focus of future work, clarify the security guarantees for combat and nation-building, and the path forward, so that compatriots throughout the country can work together.</p>
<p>Government's Resistance and Nation-Building Policy Proves Appropriate and Effective</p>
<p>Regarding this point, colleagues first base their unanimous understanding and beliefs, and respectfully raise two points to inform our people. First, China's combat has indeed achieved spiritual victory. Therefore, the guidelines and policies announced in the National Government's Resistance and Nation-Building Program have proven to be appropriate and effective. China's combat is a major event in the world, but all countries in the world have ignored it. Although public opinion is prosperous, empty words are useless. Only by relying on all our soldiers, fighting bravely and hard, month after month, year after year, spitting out the righteousness of heaven and earth, blocking the turbulent waves in the Far East, until today, ten years later, the whole world suddenly recognizes that the hard-fighting China is actually the cornerstone of the Far East situation. The international community has always looked down on China, not knowing that the Chinese nation has the determination to fight to the end and the great power to never be conquered. The combat in the past three years and seven months has proven the unbreakable nature of this determination and power. All the main points of the declaration of the First Session of the First National Political Council have also proven to be correct in these two years. In the future, we should strengthen our belief in self-defense. People all over the world unanimously recognize that China will never be conquered and perish. This is the spiritual victory of China, the victory of the Three People's Principles, and a permanent blessing for our combat soldiers and civilians who shed blood for the country. There is no other way to victory. The reason is extremely just, the purpose is extremely pure, combat is for self-defense and self-rescue, nation-building is for self-reliance and self-preservation, we have no means other than abiding by our beliefs in the world, and no demands other than freedom and equality, we run through the purpose of combat with self-sacrifice, and we accept international cooperation with peace and justice. This kind of guideline, based on the spirit of history and culture, has become the common belief of the nation. Four years of bloody battle, unyielding and indomitable, has proven its obvious effect today. What we hope our people will believe in more firmly is that it will never change. (Unfinished telegram from the 10th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The First Session of the First National Political Council, after several days of meetings, all proposals and the government's internal and external guidelines for the 30th year and reports from various departments have been discussed and completed. The General Assembly held a closing ceremony at 10 a.m. today. The number of attendees was even more enthusiastic than in the previous days. Before 10 a.m., the audience seats were already full. Zhang Boling, Zuo Shunsheng, Zhang Junli, Wu Yifang, Secretary-General Wang Shijie, Deputy Secretary-General Zhou Binglin, and councilors Xi Zhentao, Luo Lixue, and others, totaling 178 people, attended. Those from Party, government, and military agencies and central committee members who were present included Ju Zheng, Dai Jitao, Yu Youren, Kong Xiangxi, Wu Jingheng, Chen Guofu, Niu Yongjian, Chen Shuren, Wang Chonghui, Weng Wenhao, Xu Shiying, Chen Lifu, Gu Zhenggang, Wu Zhongxin, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Jitang, Zhou Tieyue, Chen Bulei, Chen Qicai, Xie Guansheng, Zhang Zhizhong, He Jian, Liu Zhi, He Guoguang, Jiang Zuobin, Pan Gongzhan, Xiao Tongzi, Hong Lanyou, and others, totaling more than 60 people. At 8 a.m., the meeting began with music. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek performed the ceremony as usual, and then Chairman Chiang delivered a closing speech, hoping that the councilors would oversee the government and the national people in accordance with the spirit of seeking truth from facts on various items such as diplomacy, military affairs, politics, and economy, allowing its resident committee members to assist the government and urge the government to thoroughly implement the proposals during the recess. After the speech, Councilor Mo Dehui rose to give a reply on behalf of all the councilors. After the meeting, Chairman Zhang Boling officially read the declaration of the General Assembly. The First Session of the Second National Political Council concluded in a solemn and solemn atmosphere with melodious music (telegram from the 10th).</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang's Closing Remarks: Should Supervise the Government and the National People in the Spirit of Seeking Truth from Facts, and Implement All British Resolutions Effectively</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The First Session of the Second National Political Council concluded on the 10th. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek delivered a closing speech, the original text of which is as follows: The First Session of the Second National Political Council has come to a successful conclusion today. All of you colleagues have established substantial and complete resolutions on various reports and proposals through ten days of hard work and effort. The government will definitely implement them accordingly. In the future, not only will the combat be greatly advanced, but also the spirit of unity of our national people from beginning to end can be fully demonstrated internally and externally. This will inevitably lead to the greatest victory and success in military and diplomatic affairs, which is what the colleagues of this meeting feel most gratified about. On the occasion of this closing session, as colleagues are about to return to various places or overseas, I would like to specifically state the key points that we should focus on in our future efforts.</p>
<p>Valuable Application: Past Experience</p>
<p>Based on my feelings, I will briefly state them. What I must tell you is that in the three and a half years before this General Assembly, our greatest task in combat was to strike violence with the strong spirit of national unity, so as to lay the foundation for national victory. After this meeting, the progress of all resistance and nation-building undertakings has become even more urgent due to the internal and external situation. Success or failure, advantages or disadvantages, are of greater importance. In addition to emphasizing the spirit, we must also pay special attention to the specific actions and the performance of all work and facts in various departments. It is necessary to apply the past experience and lessons learned in a valuable way. Everything must be based on seeking truth from facts, so as to promote progress step by step. The government and the people must be vigilant and fearful, and there must be no perfunctory or exaggerated behavior. It is even more appropriate to absolutely sacrifice the views of parties or individual interests, strengthen the contact with friendly countries such as the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States, and the consistent support of this meeting for diplomatic national policies will surely fully achieve the purpose of our resistance and nation-building. In terms of politics, the biggest shortcoming in China's past politics lies in advocating declarations without striving for practical action. Therefore, after each session, all the declared resolutions often become empty talk. The reason why politics is abandoned is because this is the fundamental reason. After the adjournment of this meeting, all colleagues should supervise the government and the national people to implement the resolutions of this meeting in a practical and effective manner in the spirit of seeking truth from facts.</p>
<p>During the recess of the General Assembly, all resident staff members will inevitably assist the government in a timely manner based on their powers. I also hope that all my colleagues will similarly urge the people to assist the government in various places, so that all facilities can be promoted quickly and surely. Then our politics will inevitably gain more and more progress every day.</p>
<p>Implement Military Orders and Rectify Discipline</p>
<p>In terms of military affairs, the government's efforts to replenish combat strength have been sufficient to fill the sacrifices and consumption in combat, and have more than doubled compared with before the war. The prospect of resistance and nation-building has indeed been firmly grasped. The only key in the future is to implement military orders and rectify military discipline. If military orders can be implemented and military discipline can be rectified, then the final victory will not be far off. I have said this repeatedly. What I hope for from the colleagues of this meeting is to advocate that the national people confirm the absolute importance of wartime discipline, supervise the government and assist the government to strictly rectify military discipline and implement military orders, so as to complete the mission of resistance and nation-building. In terms of economy, this is a problem of great concern to this General Assembly, and it is also related to the success or failure, survival or death in the future. If the wartime economic problems can be solved and economic construction can be completed at the same time, then the prospect of victory will be firmly guaranteed. The proposals and resolutions of this meeting on economic matters are all practical and important. I believe that the government will be able to implement them effectively, and I hope that all of you will assist them together. Not only should you study the advantages and disadvantages of the current problems of food, supplies, transportation, and transportation at any time, contribute practical materials and opinions, and seek a satisfactory solution, but also pay attention to the fundamental economic construction of the country. We should not only make the wartime economic foundation absolutely solid, but also make national defense economic construction solid. Such as developing materials, increasing production, promoting national industrialization, and hoping to advocate the joint efforts of the whole country.</p>
<p>Economic Construction is Most Important</p>
<p>What is most memorable to us is that the practical contribution of the colleagues of the First National Political Council to promoting national military and economic construction was very great. Taking the Sichuan-Kang construction period achievement meeting as an example, the achievements of the two provinces of Sichuan and Kang in banning opium and suppressing bandits today, as well as other political and economic progress, are mostly due to the fact that the colleagues of the period achievement meeting personally went to various places, regardless of hardships, to assist the government in implementing them with practical strength. If they can continue to do so consistently, then I believe that the work of suppressing bandits and banning opium in the two provinces of Sichuan and Kang will be fully implemented, and economic construction and political transformation will be able to make rapid progress.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the work of the colleagues of this meeting participating in the military discipline inspection tour the year before last had a great effect on the rectification of military discipline in the front. I hope that the colleagues of this session will continue to carry forward this spirit of personal practice, so that it can be carried forward and magnified. In the important period of economic combat, if the colleagues of this meeting can not avoid hard work and give investigation and inspection to the national transportation transportation cause, and contribute to the government for adoption, then its benefit to resistance and nation-building is limitless.</p>
<p>In short, what I hope for from the colleagues of this meeting today is that all of you should understand the earnest expectations of the people and the seriousness of your responsibilities, and contribute your spiritual ability to the cause of resistance and nation-building with the government's intimate spirit, working together harmoniously, so as to complete the historical mission undertaken by this meeting.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Milestone of Democratic Victory</h3>
<p>The "Lease-Lend Act," which had been discussed by the US Senate and House of Representatives for two months, was finally passed completely by an overwhelming vote. In terms of the real international situation, it will guarantee and promote the victory of democratic countries such as China, Britain, and Greece; in terms of the future of human civilization, it will herald the expansion of democracy and the ultimate destruction of violent autocracy; and the bill itself and its establishment process are precisely the products of the democratic spirit, specifically illustrating the greatness of its power. If we consider China's protracted war of resistance, Britain's isolated defense against violence, and Greece's daring to embrace the fierce front, as clearing the way for democracy and expanding the road to victory, then the US move is an important milestone on the road to victory.</p>
<p>This bill has undergone a two-month discussion process; the traditional motto of democratic countries is "slow but sure," and this spirit permeates the US move thoroughly. During this period, countries such as Germany, Italy, and Japan once made a gesture, attempting to threaten and lure the United States to abandon this bill, and isolationists in the United States also tried to obstruct and kill its establishment, but it was finally passed. It is especially worth noting that President Roosevelt's political opponent Wilkie always abandoned the prejudice of the opposing party and enthusiastically supported this bill; in addition, many people who opposed this bill, except for a very small number who may still hold stubborn prejudices, also decided to fully accept and abide by it after this bill became a national policy. All of this proves the overwhelming power of public reason and public opinion under the democratic system, as well as the efficiency of the democratic system. When dictatorship and violence are rampant for a while, the victorious achievements of this democratic spirit are really valuable and important.</p>
<p>Of course, the countries that are fighting for democracy on the front line are undoubtedly China, Britain, Greece, and other countries. The targets of the aid provided by this US bill are also these countries; the ultimate goal is to help democratic countries win. According to this bill, the United States has almost expressed its determination to use any method to achieve the goal. Turning the United States completely into "the arsenal of democratic countries" is the first and the minimum item. From then on, the United States will mobilize all its resources and strength to rush to build war tools; but the method and meaning are not for profit, not for trade, so it is not a sale but completely "lease," which is aid. Its final scope is not even limited to the resources of the United States alone. Wherever the power of the United States can be used, such as Central and South America, it will eventually belong to this "arsenal" system and become the rear base for the overall democratic countries to fight. Furthermore, from a further observation, the actual position of the United States in the two major wars in the East and West, although it has not legally participated in the war and is not a belligerent country, in fact, it can be said that it has partially participated in the war by means of weapon participation. Under this understanding, the United States should not only be satisfied with providing war tools to China, Britain, Greece, and other countries, expressing its sympathy as a third country, but will actively plan for the conditions and strategies for the victory of all democratic countries; and the establishment of the so-called "highest authority" will take comprehensive planning as its biggest mission! According to rumors, Mr. Corley, who returned from China, and Mr. Hopkins, who returned from Britain, will all be recruited into this organization, precisely to thoroughly understand the current needs and actual situation of China and Britain to determine the type and quantity of aid it provides. In this situation, the United States is not only the "arsenal" of various democratic countries, but also a strong reserve army in terms of material resources. Looking at the actual situation, the issue of the transportation of military supplies occupied a very important position in the process of the establishment of this US bill; and the result of the discussion and voting only inserted such a provision: this bill, "does not implicitly authorize the government, especially to allow American ships to transport military supplies in war zones"; and the proposal absolutely prohibiting American ships from entering war zones put forward by the isolationists was rejected; in contrast, it can be regarded as the participation of American ships in transporting military supplies, retaining the greatest possibility. In case Germany, Italy, and Japan announce a blockade or obstruction of the transportation of military supplies, then the United States will of course eliminate this kind of obstacle and evolve into a crisis of frontal conflict. So it exists anytime and anywhere. Therefore, according to this bill, the participation of the United States in the war is only a secondary formal issue. The most important point is to find and guarantee the victory of democratic countries by all possible means.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the process of the establishment of this US bill, its most fundamental significance is obviously still to help China, Britain, Greece, and other countries to win; in other words, what is negative is to defeat those who are bad, and what is positive is to unite and cooperate with the common ideals of all just forces in the world to create the world of the future. It is not difficult to imagine that China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, Greece, Turkey, and all other countries that cherish independence and freedom are in the ranks of the human civilization crusade.</p>
<h3>The Second National Political Council's First General Assembly: Government Reports, Review Opinions, and Resolutions</h3>
<p>Hopes for Actively Promoting the Establishment of a Popular Opinion Organ; Foreign Policy Still Adapting to the International Environment; Hope that the Government Takes Responsibility for the Seriousness of Military Discipline</p>
<p>Chongqing – This session of the National Political Council held its first assembly, and the ministers of the government gave detailed reports on the administration over the past ten months. After listening to the reports, the council referred them to various review committees for detailed examination, providing opinions for consideration. These opinions were solemnly decided upon by the assembly. The following is a selection of the main points of the resolutions:</p>
<p>(1) Internal Affairs: During the war, efforts to reform internal affairs have been commendable, and progress in anti-opium measures has been rapid. The disaster relief agencies and the allocation of relief funds, as well as the number of people rescued, have been quite detailed. There has also been progress in Mongolian and Tibetan administration, which is gratifying. However: (1) Regarding internal affairs, the implementation of the new county system has largely begun in various provinces. It is hoped that more practical solutions will be found to the difficulties of talent and finance. At the same time, it is advisable to investigate the implementation situation to facilitate improvement. It is hoped that the establishment of popular opinion organs will be actively promoted to advance the implementation of local self-government. It is particularly hoped that detailed plans will be made for training the people to exercise the four powers, so that there will be a path to follow. In the future, special attention should be paid to the selection, assessment, reward, and punishment of administrative personnel at all levels, so that official governance can be effectively improved. It is also necessary to unify administrative orders and strictly require provincial and county governments to implement them thoroughly, so that administrative efficiency can be increased. The postponement of the National Assembly is due to military exigencies, inconvenient transportation, and limitations of fact, which are unavoidable. However, it is still hoped that election matters will be completed as soon as possible, so that the National Assembly can be convened as scheduled. In addition, regarding land administration, it is hoped that the rear provinces will implement it as soon as possible within a possible range to benefit the people's livelihood. (2) Regarding disaster relief, there are many disaster relief agencies established in various places. In the future, it is hoped that more attention will be paid to assessment and evaluation to maximize efficiency. The number of disaster victims and refugees who have not been accommodated is still considerable, and investigations and statistics should be carried out to continue to find ways to provide relief. (3) Regarding anti-opium measures, the functions of the anti-opium commission should be strengthened, and its funding should be increased. The efforts of anti-smuggling should be strengthened, its organization should be tightened, and it should be promoted universally without regional distinction, so that smokers, sellers, and transporters will have something to avoid. All existing opium soil, or those seized in the future, should be burned. Those reserved for pharmaceutical use should be jointly kept in custody by the relevant authorities to ensure prudence. (4) Regarding Mongolia and Tibet, attention should be paid to the selection of personnel sent to work in Mongolian and Tibetan areas, whether they are competent. Their work performance should also be assessed to enhance efficiency and avoid wasting national funds. Mongolian and Tibetan youth should be actively cultivated for the development and construction of Mongolia and Tibet.</p>
<p>(2) Foreign Affairs: The foreign affairs report resolution recognizes that the foreign policy adopted by the government is still able to adapt to changes in the international environment and meets the needs of our country's war. The assistance given to our country by the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom in spirit and material is deeply inspiring to all our people, and the Assembly expresses its sincere gratitude. However, it is necessary to strengthen the ties between the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, to build a bulwark against aggression, and to lay the foundation for safeguarding peace. Diplomatic relations with the countries of the South Pacific should be urgently established or strengthened. Foreigners are now enticing other countries to recognize the puppet organization. Our country should reiterate its solemn position that anyone who recognizes the puppet organization is a public enemy of our country and should sever all relations with them. As for the reform of diplomatic institutions, the refreshment of diplomatic personnel, the collection of international intelligence, and the intensification of overseas propaganda, it is hoped that these will be effectively improved so as to be able to shoulder the heavy responsibilities during and after the war. The contributions of overseas Chinese to the war are very great, and the government should effectively protect them and grant them encouragement.</p>
<p>(3) Military Affairs: The military report resolution first expresses satisfaction with the Supreme Commander's coordination with allied countries to inspire the military and civilians to resolutely fight for the final victory during the drastic changes in the European war and the changing situation in the Far East as Japan advances southward. It also expresses admiration for the achievements in the provinces of Hubei and Henan, the continued implementation of military reorganization plans, the efforts in education and political training, the unified control of transportation and communication, the enrichment of armed equipment, and the improvement of conscription administration. It is particularly hoped that the government will take effective responsibility for the strict rectification of military discipline, as the final victory of the war of resistance is premised on the unification of domestic military administration and military orders. If the internal armies do not obey orders, are not subject to command, or even act freely, destroying laws and disrupting discipline, it will inevitably weaken the national strength internally and be taken advantage of by the enemy externally. The mutiny of the New Fourth Army was an unfortunate incident since the war began. This council believes that military orders must be unified and military discipline must be strict. The future military construction policy lies in following the declaration made to this council by Chairman Chiang, that the army belongs to the state, so that the national army stands under unified military orders, unified command, and unified management. Those who destroy laws, disrupt discipline, and disobey military orders will not be tolerated. For future military planning and the strengthening of equipment, the government should implement them to speed up the victory of the war. (To be continued in the eleventh day telegram)</p>

According to the Commodity Inspection Bureau, although the exports of hog bristles and sheep casings from Sichuan Province in February were less than in January, the export of sheepskin to Hong Kong and the export of white silk via the Yunnan-Burma Road increased significantly.

<h3>Remains of China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Plane Found in Hunan</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The CNAC plane that mysteriously disappeared en route from Hong Kong to Chongqing on February 12 has been found. The company's pilot discovered the wreckage of the plane on a peak of Jiangjia Mountain. This mountain, which is 7,000 feet high, is located in Daoxian (under the jurisdiction of Hunan), on the border of Hunan, Guangdong, and Jiangxi provinces. Since two of the company's pilots discovered the wreckage of the plane last Saturday, the local authorities have sent 200 laborers to the scene. According to the latest news received here, the wreckage of the plane is located on a 75-degree slope, 100 feet below the peak. The laborers can only reach a point 200 yards away. The cause of the accident seems to be a hurricane. The plane was blown against the peak. The three people on board (the pilot, co-pilot, and a bank employee) died immediately. The rumor that the pilots starved to death is unreliable, as the canned food they were carrying was untouched. (Eleventh day Reuters telegram)</p>
<h3>Dr. Baker Arrives in Chongqing, To Take New Position</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Dr. Baker arrived here by plane from Hong Kong today to discuss the preliminary details of taking over as President of the Yunnan-Burma Road Committee. It is learned that Chairman Chiang asked Dr. Baker to take on the position two weeks ago. The doctor also said that if he could resign from his position at the American Red Cross, he would accept the new position. The American Red Cross has now approved his resignation. It is understood that after an agreement is reached on the detailed plan for reorganizing the traffic management of the road and the matters of jurisdiction, Dr. Baker will be officially appointed. All parties, both Chinese and foreign, here have given favorable comments on the far-reaching reorganization plan to increase traffic on the road. It is said that this plan coincides with the passage of the American Lend-Lease Act, which will greatly increase American aid to China. Dr. Baker's experience in famine relief, dike construction, and transportation in China makes it believed here that he can cooperate with the Chinese authorities to quickly obtain aid to China from the United States and other foreign countries.

<h3>To Cope with the International Crisis, the United States Is Expanding Its Military Preparations with All Its Might; Senate Approves Additional National Defense Budget; Funding for Fortifications on Guam Is Also Included</h3>
<p>New Orleans – Secretary of the Navy Knox stated here that "the situation of the democratic countries is now very critical, and the world is closer to the horrors of war than it was 90 days ago." He believes that Britain has been defeated, but has not been conquered, so he urged the United States to have the strongest two-ocean navy in the world, the strongest air force, and an army equal to other countries. He also said, "Germany has created the most powerful war machine in the world, and we cannot ignore it. The reason why our country is still safe today is thanks to the sea power and air power of Britain." (Eleventh day United Press telegram)</p>
<p>Washington – It was learned here yesterday that the US Navy is planning to build a base worth US$400,000,000 for "a large number of expeditionary landing ships." This matter is related to the preparation of the expeditionary force. This plan is contained in the report of Senator Walsh, Chairman of the Senate Naval Committee, and has been submitted to the Naval Act. The release of this matter follows closely after the Senate's approval of the expansion of the Naval Act. At the same time, the Senate also approved another huge naval budget step. President Roosevelt also requested Congress to pass another extraordinary naval budget bill, worth US$3,000,841,000. The Senate also approved the fourth national defense supplementary bill, worth US$1,533,000,000, of which US$35,000,000 is used for the construction of a naval base on the island of Puerto Rico. The most important of President Roosevelt's recent requests to Congress is the request for US$113,000,000 to purchase naval artillery and ammunition during extraordinary times, and it includes US$63,000,000 to immediately purchase 12 cargo ships for transporting ammunition and supplies. The President's request was not leaked in advance. (Eleventh day United Press telegram)</p>
<p>Washington – The Senate yesterday verbally approved US$242,000,000 for naval and public works expenses, authorizing limited fortifications on Guam and building air force bases on the Atlantic islands acquired from Britain.

<p>The United States Declares that Other Countries May Not Transfer Territory in the Western Hemisphere</p>
<p>Washington – The Senate unanimously passed a bill yesterday, declaring that the US government cannot recognize the principle of non-American countries transferring any land they own in the Western Hemisphere to another non-American country. This bill stipulates that if there is a possibility of such a transfer, the United States, in addition to exploring other means, should immediately consult with other American countries to determine the measures to be taken to protect their common interests.

<h3>The US Lend-Lease Act Completes Final Procedures; Becomes Law Upon Presidential Signature</h3>
<p>Washington – The House of Representatives agreed to limit the final stage of debate on the Lend-Lease Act to two hours, bringing the completion of the final procedures of the bill closer. The members of the House unanimously supported the final debate, which should be carried out by receiving all the amendments passed by the Senate in a single vote. Texas Democratic Representative Rayburn said that if the Lend-Lease Act is completed today, President Roosevelt intends to submit the first request for funds for the bill to Congress on Wednesday. The amount of funds is still uncertain, ranging from 10 billion to 30 billion. Rayburn and Vice President Wallace and Senator Barkley (Senate Majority Leader) held a meeting for the fund request. (Eleventh day United Press telegram)</p>
<p>Washington – It is now learned that President Roosevelt intends to make a statement or use a wireless radio to broadcast a "fireside chat" again after signing the Lend-Lease Act on Wednesday. The content will be to explain the general purpose of the Lend-Lease Act. (Eleventh day United Press telegram)</p>
<p>Washington – There is now reason to believe that President Roosevelt will announce the transfer of another batch of destroyers to Britain after signing the Lend-Lease Act. This is an important step for the President to immediately implement the Lend-Lease Act within a week. People here believe that since the Lend-Lease Act has been passed, those who previously opposed it will now vote to support the funds needed for the act, because they feel that since the country wants this act, the country should go all out to support it, and give it support short of entering the war. (Eleventh day Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>Washington – Senator Vandenberg told reporters yesterday that in two roll call votes, the number of senators who supported helping Britain with the Lend-Lease Act or with a substitute method of 20 billion debt proposed by Senator Taft each accounted for 89 of the 95 senators. This type of vote is more likely to show national unity than the final roll call vote. (Eleventh day Reuters telegram)</p>
<h3>Agreement Signed in Tokyo: Vietnamese-Thai Peace Achieved, France and Vietnam Painfully Cede Territory to Thailand, Japan Praises Its Diplomatic Success</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Thai-Vietnamese peace plan proposed by Japan was signed by the plenipotentiary representatives of the three countries at the Japanese Prime Minister's official residence at 4:00 PM today (3:00 PM Shanghai time). According to this plan, France was forced to cede vast territories of Laos and Cambodia to Thailand. The lands that Vietnam had repeatedly acquired from Thailand through treaties in the 19th and 20th centuries have now been lost again. With France ceding land to Thailand, peace is formally restored, and the border disputes between the two countries are resolved. These border disputes had caused numerous conflicts until Japan intervened as a mediator early last month, leading to a ceasefire. After the signing of the peace treaty, the Japanese Foreign Ministry declared that it "lays the cornerstone for building the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," and stated that Japan would not tolerate any obstruction to this process. The statement claimed that a certain third country had tried to obstruct the negotiations, but peace was ultimately restored due to the goodwill and cooperative attitude of the French and Thai governments. The statement did not specify which third country it was referring to, but affirmed that such obstruction would not be tolerated. Before Japan signed the treaty, the French government insisted on modifying a portion of the Japanese proposal regarding the cession of territory. It is understood that under the terms signed today, France will retain a portion of the land that Japan originally required France to cede to Thailand based on Thailand's original demands. (Eleventh, United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Key Points of the Treaty</p>
<p>(1) France cedes to Thailand (a) the Barclay area as described in Article 2 of the Franco-Siamese Convention of February 13, 1904; (b) land north of the boundary line between the provinces of Battambang and Siem Reap; (c) land on the right bank of the Mekong River, bounded on the south by the southernmost point where a line extending northward from a certain point touches the line between Great Laos and the provinces of Siem Reap and Battambang. However, a small area opposite Stung Treng remains part of Vietnam. (2) The ceded territories will be demilitarized zones. French and Vietnamese residents will enjoy absolutely equal treatment with Thai citizens in terms of entry, residence, and occupation. (3) The Thai government is willing to respect the royal tombs of the Luang Prabang royal family located in the triangular area opposite Luang Prabang and provide facilities for their preservation and worship. (4) The Mekong River boundary line will be delineated according to the main deep channel, with two islands under Thai sovereignty but jointly administered by France and Thailand. French constructions currently on the islands will remain French property.</p>
<p>Exchange of letters between Japan and France and between Japan and Thailand clarifies the agreement for mediation. Japan guarantees the precise nature of the dispute based on the above-mentioned mediation conditions. Agreements on maintaining peace in Greater East Asia and laying the foundation for and enhancing particularly close relations between Japan and Thailand and between Japan and Vietnam will be discussed later. (Eleventh, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Matsuoka's Speech</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Matsuoka delivered a speech at the afternoon meeting today as follows: Since the opening of the conference to resolve the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute, the first official meeting was convened on February 7. Since then, representatives from the countries involved and the mediator have held informal talks daily with a sincere attitude. Thanks to the spirit of mutual understanding and concession between the French and Thai representatives, and the unyielding efforts of the mediating country, a consensus was happily reached, and the compromise was confirmed today by the signatures of the three parties, France, Thailand, and Japan. This negotiation thus concluded satisfactorily just over a month after the opening of the mediation conference. Henceforth, friendly relations between France and Thailand have been restored, and the connection of co-existence and co-prosperity among the three parties is even more concrete, making a considerable contribution to the construction of Greater East Asia and world peace, which is truly worthy of celebration. The signing ceremony took place in the hall of the Prime Minister's official residence. The three parties' representatives signed at 4:05 PM. The French and Thai representatives used fountain pens, while Matsuoka and Matsumiya used calligraphy brushes. After Matsuoka's speech, French Ambassador Henri rose to deliver a speech, thanking him for his efforts in promoting the compromise. (Eleventh, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Vietnamese Economy Heavily Losses</p>
<p>French sources in Saigon do not place much importance on the loss of Vietnamese land resulting from the Tokyo Agreement, and predict that indigenous people dissatisfied with Thailand will cause difficulties for Thailand, but admit that France's prestige has been damaged as a result. The general commentary by French sources on the Tokyo Agreement is "The loss of land certainly damages our country's prestige, but it is not economically significant." These people point out that the 18,000 square miles of land lost to Thailand is less than one-twentieth of the total area of Vietnam. Of this, only the provinces of Battambang and Siem Reap (both transliterations) are economically important, while the other areas in Laos are poor and sparsely populated. However, as a result of being forced to cede the two provinces of Battambang and Siem Reap, France will lose some of the most valuable rice-producing areas in Vietnam. These two provinces produce 250,000 tons of the best rice annually. However, this figure is small compared to the more than five million tons of rice produced in southern Vietnam. These areas also produce 100,000 tons of corn and have a large export of pepper. In addition, the French will lose the large sapphire mine near Pailin south of Battambang, the famous ancient sites and temples of Angkor, part of the 50,000-ton annual fishery harvest from the Great Lake, and some rubber plantations. The main indigenous people in the lost areas are the Khmer people, whose ancestors helped build the great temples of Angkor. The Khmer people are very dissatisfied with the Thai people, so once the French withdraw, there will inevitably be disputes between them and the Thai people. (Eleventh, United Press Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Germany to Intensify Offensive After Clear Weather in Europe, Focusing Attack on British Maritime Transport, Britain Considering Ways to Defeat Submarines</h3>
<p>Rome - The conservative newspaper Vorlandsera reports that the spring weather will intensify the Axis powers' offensive in Europe and ease Britain's war effort in East Africa. The warm weather is very useful for military operations in Northeastern Europe, the English Channel, and the North Sea, while Africa is either hot or subject to heavy rain, unsuitable for military operations. (Eleventh, United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>London - A Reuters naval correspondent says that in his last speech, Hitler threatened that Germany would intensify the maritime war on an unprecedented scale. Now that the weather is gradually improving and the season for operations has arrived, it is expected that Germany will exert all its strength in the Atlantic to cut off Britain's lifeline of food and war supplies. With the US Lend-Lease Act passed tonight, Germany cannot but devote itself to this in order to stop US supplies to Britain. Last year, Germany occupied a coastline of 2,000 miles in Europe, which is a new problem that the British Navy and Air Force are trying to cope with with greater determination. After the US Lend-Lease Act becomes law, the British Navy further increases its responsibility for escorting ships. The main naval battle locations are expected to be northwest of Britain and east of Iceland, where British ships are equipped with new submarine detection equipment and are now working closely with the British Air Force day and night in preparation for naval battles. According to reliable estimates, Germany has between 100 and 150 submarines available, but not all of these submarines can be at sea at the same time. Britain is currently considering all possible ways to defeat submarines. Its best scientists are racking their brains to improve the tools for detecting submarines and defending aircraft, and the issue of escorting is currently under close attention by the authorities. (Eleventh, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London - A Reuters air force correspondent says that the strength of the British Air Force in the Middle East and the Balkans continues to grow. Although the Italian threat has diminished, the German air threat has increased. However, the British Air Force is strong enough not only to contain the German Air Force but also to expand its range of activities, independently attacking enemy territory or covering the army, and will always take the initiative. The weather in Southeast Europe will soon clear up, and the Air Force will be able to carry out more extensive activities. The weather in Africa will worsen, making it difficult for the Air Force to operate. Hitler is now trying to save the country from collapse and protect his rear while preparing to attack the bases of British interests. It is estimated that Germany currently has about 1,000 aircraft assembled to operate on both sides of the Mediterranean. Currently, the German Air Force has invaded Bulgaria from Romania and established bases on the Greek border and near the Black Sea, with oil supplied by the Soviet Union transported via the Black Sea. Other major bases of the German Air Force are in Italy and Sicily, and there are also a small number of German aircraft in Libya and the Dodecanese Islands. British aircraft are not very active in the skies over Germany and the occupied areas, probably due to weather conditions. However, the Germans are well aware of the danger of the next British attack and frequently make their people take shelter quickly in the event of an air raid. (Eleventh, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin - German military experts commenting on the war situation say that during the World War, the Dover and Northern artillery, extending from the Shetland Islands to the Norwegian coast, exerted extraordinary power. Britain then blocked the two exits of the Atlantic with warships and mines, so Germany was isolated from the outside world. Since Germany's victory last year, Germany's situation is the opposite of that during the World War. The artillery at those two locations has already fired at Britain. The sea lanes west of Ireland and the North and St. George's Channels have become "dead ends" for British shipping. Britain is using convoys and single ships to alleviate the difficulty of supplying Britain. The cost paid by Britain can be seen from the loss of British ships. Sometimes British ships take advantage of the dim night to smuggle through the German blockade line, but German naval and air forces and long-range coastal artillery still inflict heavy losses on Britain. This can be proven by the total annihilation of many British convoys. (Eleventh, Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Britain Will Clear German Presence at Sea</p>
<p>Somewhere in the Mediterranean - British Mediterranean Fleet Commander Admiral Cunningham told reporters yesterday that British planes and artillery will drive the German Air Force out of the Mediterranean, just as the Italian Air Force lost its momentum months ago. Admiral Cunningham received reporters on his flagship at a secret location in the Mediterranean. When reporters asked if the German Air Force would defeat the British fleet once launched, Mr. Cunningham replied, "At the beginning of the war, the Italian Air Force was very active against our navy. Now it's the Germans' turn. The German Air Force is clearly superior to the Italian one. The Germans clashed with us in the Strait of Sicily at the beginning of the war, and the results were obvious. At the beginning of the war, we did not have the necessary defensive weapons and were caught off guard. I believe the German presence in the Mediterranean will be cleared soon, just like the Italian one. We already know how to defeat the Italian Air Force. Italian warplanes have not fought against our fleet since last December." (Eleventh, International Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Heavy Casualties Among Italian Troops in Albania, Many Important Italian Figures Killed in Action</h3>
<p>London - Yesterday, Greek troops in Albania launched a fierce large-scale offensive against the Italian army's central area for the fourth consecutive day. According to Athens Radio last night, Greek troops are advancing with great determination. Italian troops on the two mountain ridges where the Greek troops began their attack have now been completely cleared out. Italian machine gun outposts hidden deep in the rocks have been driven out, suffering heavy casualties, with some entire units annihilated. One unit defending the outer defenses of Tepelene (an important town on the way to the port of Vlorë) suffered heavy losses. Soldiers of the 7th Blackshirt Battalion were almost entirely killed in action. Among the Italian enemies, a member of the Fascist Administrative Council, Beligreni, was killed, and the commander of a large Italian unit that was annihilated was the Italian Minister of Education, Bottai, who may have died. According to Greek newspaper reports yesterday, Bottai and two other senior officials have been killed in action. A telegram from Mussolini to Bottai was found on the body of an Italian major, asking Bottai to do everything in his power to stop the Greek advance, and saying, "Otherwise, Fascism will be disgraced and die. The last hope of Fascist Italy rests on your defense. Please save it." (Eleventh, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Athens - The strategically important Tepelene is the gateway to the "Hindenburg Line." Yesterday, it was reported that Greek troops were about to occupy the city. Yesterday was the fourth day of the major battle since the start of the war. It is reported that Greek troops have occupied several positions on the mountain front. It is widely believed that the Greek High Command is now making its greatest effort to break through the Italian defenses before German troops arrive in Thessaloniki. After the occupation of Tepelene, it will force the Italian troops to retreat north to the positions between Durazzo and Elbasan and allow thousands of Greek troops to move east to Macedonia. Athens Radio stated that in the battles in the central sector of the Albanian front in the last two days, 3,000 Italian officers and soldiers were captured. It also stated that Greek troops launched a fierce attack on the mountainside, capturing various war trophies. It is generally believed here that this victory is as important as the occupation of Këlcyrë. (Eleventh, International Dispatch)</p>

<h3>German-Yugoslav Friendship Treaty Under Negotiation, It is Said Yugoslav Prime Minister Will Go to Vienna in a Few Days, Britain, the United States, and Germany Are Exerting Pressure on Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia - Cabinet Minister and Croatian leader Maček went to Čigelj for a weekend vacation on the eighth of this month. He was originally scheduled to return to the capital tomorrow or the day after, but he returned here this morning. Therefore, it is generally expected that the government will decide today how to approach Germany. One theory is that Yugoslavia will sign a treaty of friendship with Germany. Yugoslav Prime Minister Cvetković and Foreign Minister Marković will fly to Germany tomorrow and sign the treaty in the next few days. Another theory is that a German plane has landed at the Zaitmühle airfield in Yugoslavia to welcome the Yugoslav Prime Minister to Germany. According to the latest news, opposition members of the Yugoslav parliament, various patriotic organizations, and the British and American envoys are currently exerting great pressure on the Yugoslav government, opposing the signing of a treaty of friendship with Germany. However, the pressure from Germany is also not weak. Generally, opposition members of parliament have stated that the government should not make any decisions before Cabinet Minister Maček returns to the capital. The government then decided to summon Minister Maček back to the capital early to discuss this matter. Regarding this matter, political figures here said that the government will do its best to make as few concessions as possible when dealing with Germany, and that these concessions must be in accordance with the principle of defending sovereignty. In short, Yugoslavia does not want to sign a general agreement to cooperate with the Axis powers, but only wants to establish a treaty of non-aggression and cooperation with Germany. (Tenth, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia - It has been widely rumored that Prime Minister Cvetković and Foreign Minister Marković will go to Germany today to sign a non-aggression pact, but it was suddenly heard that the trip has been postponed. According to news from Berlin, the postponement of the trip by the Yugoslav authorities was proposed by the German side. German officials are said to be deeply dissatisfied with the Yugoslav government's procrastination. They believe that signing a non-aggression pact is actually beneficial to Yugoslavia. Germany originally had no intention of forcing Yugoslavia to accept it, and now that Yugoslavia has many internal difficulties, it can be left to its own devices. (Eleventh, Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia - It is expected that Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković will leave for Vienna at any time to sign a treaty of friendship between Yugoslavia and the Axis powers. It is rumored that Marković has already departed, and the treaty may be signed today. At the same time, Yugoslavia continues to mobilize troops on a large scale. The tone of Bulgarian newspapers advocating border revisions is becoming increasingly intense. Former Bulgarian Chief of Staff General Hristov told Bulgarian students yesterday, "We are living in a turbulent period. After this period, our country's ideals will be realized." Yugoslav newspapers have published General Hristov's remarks and the demands of Bulgarian newspapers for border revisions. (Eleventh, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Belgrade - Well-informed diplomatic circles revealed this morning that Germany has demanded that Yugoslavia sign a German-Italian-Japanese military agreement, and not just a non-aggression pact. It is said that the sudden postponement of Prime Minister Cvetković and Foreign Minister Marković's trip to Berlin was due to this reason. It is rumored that German envoy to Yugoslavia Herren has notified Marković that Germany is not satisfied with the German-Yugoslav non-aggression pact. What Germany wants is Yugoslavia's accession to the Axis. Although this news cannot yet be confirmed, it is certain that the Yugoslav politicians' trip, originally scheduled for Monday evening, has been postponed until the weekend in order to "resolve some technical issues." Rumors are spreading that Cvetković's cabinet is divided on the issue of how close Yugoslavia should be to the Axis powers. Today, this claim has been denied by Yugoslav officials. (Eleventh, International Dispatch)</p>
<p>London - Today, The Times commentator reviewed the military situation in the Balkans, predicting that the British government will take major decisions within a few days, and said that in fact it may have already taken them. The main key at present is still Yugoslavia. Two things are very clear: the increasing Nazi oppression and the disapproval of all levels of the Yugoslav people of cooperating with the Axis powers. There are various indications that the attitude of Yugoslavia is firm. If the Nazis attempt to violate its neutrality in order to attack Greece, Yugoslavia will resist. Turkey has repeatedly stated its loyalty to its treaty obligations and will participate in the struggle at the most advantageous time for the Allied countries to assist its allied countries. British Foreign Secretary Eden's discussions in Ankara and Athens have been fruitful. Before common action, there must be a common policy to guide it. (Eleventh, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London - Authorities here said today that British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Cripps immediately visited Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky after returning to Moscow from Turkey.

<h3>British Ships Sunk, Obstructing the Suez Canal</h3>
<p>Rome - According to Romanian sailors arriving today at the Black Sea port of Constanta, four British ships were sunk by German and Italian bombers, so the Suez Canal has been partially blocked. This group of 34 Romanian sailors were crew members from Romanian oil tankers captured by the British fleet several weeks ago. They arrived in Constanta aboard the Romanian ship Dacia. They claimed that it would take weeks for Britain to remove the sunken ships from the Suez Canal. (Eleventh, United Press Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Authorities Did Not Adopt Severe Measures; Rice Prices Rose Again Yesterday; They Also Know the Security Situation Is Grave, But Hint at Implementing Price Controls as the Limit</h3>
<p>American Rice is of Good Quality and May Be Available for Sale</p>
<p>Local rice market: In the source of rice, Wang, in the situation where the authorities claimed that they would soon implement severe punishment measures, fell once the day before yesterday, and suddenly rose again yesterday by two or four yuan. The "premium" was increased to 2,500 yuan per hundred bags. The speculators' methods are becoming more and more vicious. Regardless of how abundant the source is, all are hoarded by these people to reduce the spot goods in the market and achieve their purpose of wantonly raising prices. In addition to some people having a large amount of capital, they also use special forces to carry out their illegal activities. It is said that each warehouse along the Pudong River currently hoards about one million bags of rice. This amount of rice is still being hoarded. It is hoped that the authorities of the concession and all relevant parties will break through their feelings and engage in thorough investigation, and strive to find the truth to resolve the chaos and quell the floating rumors.</p>
<p>Price Control of Rice Adopts New Measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the food situation in Shanghai is becoming increasingly serious. All parties are anxiously awaiting action from the authorities. Until yesterday (the – day), the responsible party stated that the authorities of the two concessions and the "city" are preparing to adopt new measures, intending to intensify the control of rising rice prices and improve the general rice situation. It is noted that in the past few days, the government has remained silent on the serious rice situation. The public acquiesced that the authorities were in a difficult situation. Until yesterday, the government gave some hints and said that the reason for the silence in the past few days was that the authorities of the two concessions and the "municipal government" all believed that empty words would not help the matter. Therefore, the authorities changed their silent attitude and must regard it as a promising sign.</p>
<p>The Authorities Explained the Limits of Their Power: The authorities explained again yesterday that their powers are subject to strict limitations and emphasized that the three parties will now cooperate prudently to improve the recognized serious situation. The authorities will focus on the implementation of price limits and carefully investigate the purchase price and freight of rice so as to accurately know what the fair retail price of rice is. The three parties all feel that close, unified action will exert a stronger influence on the rice situation. However, the power to truly control it is legally limited.</p>
<p>Last Week's Meeting Reached an Agreement</p>
<p>It is reported that representatives from the two concessions and the "city" held an important meeting on the rice situation last week on the 1st, and a basic agreement has been reached. However, the details have not yet been announced. The authorities are also working closely with the Shanghai Rice and Bean Industry Association and repeatedly engage in consultations. Although government officials say that the authorities can only take supervisory actions, they express their deep belief that the formulation of a decisive plan and its consistent implementation can be effective. The current rice situation is extremely difficult. In addition to speculation and manipulation, there are also political situations, economic chaos, and a shortage of ships. If the actual and potential dangers are eliminated, this problem can be solved soon.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Rice Market Manipulations Intensified</p>
<p>The English Great Beauty Evening News reports that the city's rice prices reached a new high this morning (the 11th). The first-class real rice is 104 yuan per picul, the first-class tribute rice is 98 yuan, and the cheapest foreign rice is also 96 yuan. Only the first-class domestic rice is still sold for 125 yuan, which is the same price as yesterday (the 10th). Although it was rumored this morning that 250,000 bags of foreign rice would arrive in Shanghai this week, manipulators and hoarders are still willing to pay any price to buy as much as possible. A major rice merchant said that the soaring rice prices are all due to the rampant manipulators. Retail rice shops also have to purchase from manipulators, so the responsibility for high rice prices does not lie with retail rice shops. The statement that the Rice Evaluation Committee will cooperate with the authorities of the two concessions to take strict actions has no effect on the rice market this morning. The date of the meeting of the Municipal Council directors to discuss the rice situation has not yet been announced because the authorities refuse to comment on the rice situation. The official price limit for first-class tribute rice is 87 yuan, but the price of the worst tribute rice this morning has exceeded this number by ten yuan.</p>
<p>Red Cross Relief Rice Is of Good Quality</p>
<p>This newspaper yesterday reported that the batch of 8,000 bags of American-produced relief rice from the American Red Cross, which arrived in Shanghai on the President Asquith, is of excellent quality and is produced in the United States and requires formal investigation. Now we have received a letter from the American Melon Foreign Firm, which stated, "Our firm is the Far East agent of the American Louisiana Rice Mill, which is the largest rice mill in the United States. However, the southern provinces of the United States, such as Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas, are rich in rice grains, and California also has a small amount of production. The climate and soil of the above provinces are similar to those of the rice-producing areas in China. Therefore, the officials are in charge of rice cultivation. This season's output is estimated to be 600,000 wishes, most of which will be shipped for export. Your newspaper said that the quality of this batch of rice is better than that of Saigon or Siam and is similar to Chinese rice. However, the rice produced in Louisiana has always been famous in the world. Our firm has a full set of sample rice for personal inspection. However, the current freight is high, and shipping American rice to China is not cost-effective. However, the price of rice in Shanghai continues to soar, and Saigon restricts shipping licenses, which have not been issued for a long time, and there is no cheaper water freight available, so shipping American rice to China may soon become a reality. This matter concerns the people's food, so please record and publish the letter in one corner to comfort the people's hearts."</p>
<p>Rice Prices Threaten: Grabbing Steamed Buns</p>
<p>The Charity Relief Association uses trucks to load steamed buns and distribute them along the way every evening. This good deed is still in progress. The day before yesterday, when the association used a car to leave the Renji Hall on Yunnan Road, a large number of refugees suddenly came, swarming like a wall, vying to grab and eat the steamed buns on the truck. The association's workers could not stop them, and many were snatched away. Then, the association's staff came out to persuade them, and they dispersed after a long time. This shows that there are many poor people in Shanghai who cannot withstand the threat of rice prices, and it is very difficult to find food. The situation is extremely pitiful.</p>
<p>Coal Ball Prices Are Raised Privately</p>
<p>General speculative coal merchants continue to wreak havoc on the market, attempting to raise prices and profit. Yesterday, in addition to the slightly looser market price of bituminous coal, the market price of white coal was still quite firm. A large amount of coal dust was firmly hidden. Each major coal company can use the excuse that all the inventory in the warehouse is grouped by people holding orders and does not belong to the company, so there is no coal dust on the market. Each small coal ball factory is ready for a rainy day and has sucked up a large amount of coal dust. On the one hand, the selling price of coal balls has been privately negotiated to increase by ten yuan per ton, which has been implemented since yesterday. Today (1st), the factory price is 186 yuan per ton, plus four yuan for delivery, and the retail price per dan (100 market catties) has risen to ten yuan. Yesterday, each coal shop sold it for nine yuan six, seven, or eight jiao per dan. Although major coal ball factories claim that they will not raise prices, there is no large amount of spot goods on the market. Now, the firewood and charcoal industry will send personnel to Wenzhou and Huangyan, Zhejiang Province, to negotiate the purchase of large quantities of Wenyan firewood and charcoal. Therefore, residents can buy firewood and charcoal for their daily fuel needs in the future. It is hoped that the industry association will take both radical and stopgap measures to actively dredge the source on the one hand and suppress the market price on the other, so as to benefit the common people and stabilize the market situation.</p>
<h3>Today Is the Anniversary of the Death of the Founding Father of the Nation; The Whole City Is Silent in Mourning; Adhering to the Principles of National and Ethnic Supremacy, We Strive to Advance and Complete the Great Cause of Resistance and Construction</h3>
<p>Today is the 16th anniversary of the death of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the nation. All sectors of Shanghai will fly flags at half-mast in mourning in accordance with the measures agreed upon by various public organizations and the concession authorities. All citizens of the city will also voluntarily stop entertainment banquets and eat vegetarian food for one day. At 12:00 noon, everyone will stand silently on the spot to express their condolences. All institutions, public organizations, and schools will take a holiday as usual. In addition to the Central Bank, other banks and firms in the silver and money industry will not close. Today is also the second anniversary of the National Spiritual Mobilization. In order to support the national policy of resistance and construction and implement spiritual mobilization, all sectors have decided to adhere to the supreme principles of national supremacy and ethnic supremacy, and the only policy of military first and victory first, work hard to advance, and learn from the revolutionary spirit of the founding father of the nation, work hard and struggle, and do not fear hardships, in order to win the final victory and complete the great cause.</p>
<p>Enduring Hardships and Encouraging Ambitions to Strive for Strength</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters issued a notice to the people of all sectors yesterday to commemorate the death of the Prime Minister and the National Spiritual Mobilization. The general idea is that every conscious, thoughtful, passionate, and tearful person will never forget this sad and solemn anniversary of the death of the founding father of the nation and the National Spiritual Mobilization. On the 3 years and 6 months of the war today, we must be even more deeply saddened and indignant. The Prime Minister dedicated his life to seeking liberation and freedom for the nation and mankind and fought against evil environments. We commemorate the Prime Minister's death today and allow us to commemorate the Prime Minister during the war, which makes us feel the greatness of the meaning even more. However, this cannot be commemorated casually in form. We must be diligent in encouraging ambition and strive for strength. We must follow the spirit of national responsibility for the rise and fall, lying on firewood and tasting gall, living and teaching lessons, and emulate the founding father of the nation's fearless and indomitable spirit to win the victory of resistance and construction, so that we will not be ashamed of the country and will not lose the meaning of commemorating the Prime Minister.</p>

People in the concession attach great importance to this regulation because its implementation has a great impact on the governance of the concession.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents Are Already Feeling Cold About the Municipal Council Board Elections; It Must Be Known That Westerners Occupy a Majority of the Elections; Even If They Compete, They Cannot Achieve Their Desires</h3>
<p>It is still unknown what kind of actions the Japanese residents will take when the Municipal Council holds its annual board elections on April 2 and 3 because the taxpayers of Japan are keeping silent. The date of the annual board elections is not far away. It is said that the Japanese residents have not yet made preliminary preparations for the Japanese board candidates. It is reported that the British residents will hold a primary election early next week to facilitate the nomination of British board candidates. The American residents have nominated Alerman and Minsider to participate in the board elections. Some people believe that the taxpayers of Japan know that the taxpayers of the West occupy the vast majority of the election tickets, and the Japanese residents cannot achieve their desire to increase the number of Japanese boards in the Municipal Council, so they are already feeling cold about the Municipal Council board elections.</p>
<h3>The French Concession Is Implementing Electricity Savings Due to Fuel Shortage; New Equipment or Expansions Will Not Be Accepted; And Researching How to Save Electricity Sales in the Concession</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Power Company of the Public Concession has implemented a 30% reduction in electricity since the 5th due to fuel shortages, and the Public Works Department has planned in many ways, and new users are refused. Although the French Concession Water and Electricity Company uses diesel fuel, it has not taken parallel action immediately, but due to the instability of the Far East situation, the source of diesel fuel is more difficult than before. Therefore, after several consultations with the French Municipal Council, it has been decided to implement the first step of reducing consumption. From now on, the request for power supply to users will not be accepted. Other measures are still under consideration.</p>
<p>Stop Electricity and Heat for New Households</p>
<p>Yesterday, Tan Guti, the director of the French Municipal Council, issued a public notice on this matter, which read as follows: "For the purpose of notification, it is hereby notified to the public that the French Tram Electric Light Company will not accept any requests for the supply of electric power or heat, whether it is new equipment or the expansion of existing equipment, because the current fuel is lacking and difficult to replenish. The Bureau is now also requesting the company to study how to save the sales in the concession in the shortest possible time, except for the use of existing equipment. All know this. The notice, Tan Guti, Superintendent, One."</p>
<p>Diesel Fuel Source Is More Difficult Than Before</p>
<p>French, the general manager of the French Water and Electricity Company, told reporters yesterday that all the power generation machines of the Water and Electricity Company have been burning diesel fuel since the start of operation. Now that the source is more difficult than before and it is not easy to replenish, and in order to prevent the occurrence of more difficult situations in the future, it has been decided to temporarily adopt a method of restricting the power supply request of new users. As for the problem of power reduction, the company has now begun to investigate and research, and will announce the implementation as soon as a decision is made, but the French did not announce the specific details of the difficulty of fuel supply.</p>
<p>Savings Methods Are Being Studied</p>
<p>According to a senior official of the company who told reporters yesterday, the company has recently organized a committee to consider how to reduce the supply of current to industrial and commercial dishes in the French Concession. As soon as the committee completes its research, the company will draft a report with recommendations and submit it to the French Municipal Council for approval and promulgation.</p>
<p>Very Little Impact on Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>However, according to informed sources, the French Concession Water and Electricity Company used to use 2,000 tons of diesel fuel per month, but recently, due to the difficulty of the source, it has been reduced to 1,500 tons. The reason why the French Concession is taking restrictive power consumption measures is precisely because of this. It is said that the company's current oil reserves can still be consumed for more than three months, and the amount of oil reserves in the city is still large, so there is no panic at present. It is also said that the French Concession's annual consumption of military volume last year was 67 million degrees, and the monthly average since this year has been 600 degrees, which is less than that of the Public Concession. This is because most of the larger-scale factories and firms are in the Public Concession. Therefore, even if the French Concession implements power reduction, the impact on industry and commerce will be less.</p>
<h3>Only a Little More Than a Hundred American Overseas Chinese Were Evacuated from Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The American mail ship President Pierce arrived in Shanghai from the Philippines and Hong Kong the day before yesterday and berthed at the 12th and 13th buoys. The report has been made previously.

<h3>The Budget of the Legal Department of the Public Works Department Increased by More Than 190,000 Yuan</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Continues to Promote Daylight Saving Time; Implemented from Midnight on the 15th of This Month</h3>
<p>The daylight saving time movement was promoted in Shanghai last summer. The concession authorities and various public and private groups cooperated fully and moved in the same direction. It has been effective in stimulating vitality, exercising physique, and improving work efficiency. It is now known that it will continue to be promoted this year. According to the announcement of the Information Office of the Public Works Department, the Bureau and the French Concession Municipal Council have jointly decided to start the daylight saving time movement from midnight on the 15th of this month (Saturday). At that time, all clocks will be advanced by one hour in accordance with the measures of the previous year. It is hoped that all sectors of the city and public and private groups will follow this method, which is most beneficial to the public.</p>

<h3>On the Album of Photos (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Lang Jingshan</p>
<p>The scenery of the universe, the myriad phenomena, among them, there are those that make people like them, and there are also those that make people hate them, but they all come from the nature of creation, the so-called nurturing of all things, and the eye cannot exist or abandon them because of people's likes or dislikes. Therefore, Chinese painters have never made stereotyped depictions when painting the real scenery of a place. All take what they like and abandon what they hate, thinking that it is their ideal realm, and it is not far from the normal phenomenon of nature. Photography is restricted by machinery. When shooting a negative, it is impossible to remove its partial area of the overall view. Besides, if the location is not appropriate, the appropriate angle cannot be obtained. If the foreground is too close, the distant view will be submerged. If the distant view is too far, it will not be enough to set off the foreground. It is often a pity that partial imperfections destroy the whole. Today, the album of photos is suitable to remedy it, that is, Chinese calligraphers depict natural scenery, take and place as they please, and make it a complete painting. Besides, the viewfinder of the camera is actually very stiff, and cannot be compared with the impression obtained by our human vision. Therefore, when shooting a scene, it is mostly a flat perspective, and Chinese painting also has a bird's-eye view perspective. Although there is no explicit record in the painting method, it is actually the same as the impression obtained by the human eye. Therefore, its distance is clear, and the levels are well-organized. The album of photos is also based on this principle. The foreground, middle ground, and distant view can be arranged in the foot, making it complex, deep, magnificent, not only interesting, but also can obtain a better perspective.</p>
<p>If we consider the composition of the picture, the host and guest of the scenery, opening and closing, driving the ranks, and so on, all must be appropriate. The distribution of everything in the natural scenery has its own natural laws. However, if a part of it is taken into a small picture, it cannot be exhausted. Therefore, every time you get this, you lose that. The album of photos is to add human to the obtained parts and combine them to make it perfect. This is what Chinese painting calls business location. However, it must be carved and returned to Bai Ran before it can be magical, skillful and natural.</p>
<p>The collection of materials for the album of photos can be unlimited to the land, unlimited to time, unlimited to distance, and unlimited to climate. Wherever the footprints go, they can be taken at will. A flower, a tree, a water, and a stone are all sufficient as materials for the production of the album of photos, but you must make a quick plan when taking them. That is, which one is suitable for the foreground, which one is suitable for the middle ground, which one is suitable for the distant view, which one is sufficient as the theme, and which one can still set off. All must be slightly determined one by one, and collected according to the plan. After developing and drying, re-determine in detail. When making it, first check out the negatives that you want to collect into one picture, and arrange them into chapters according to the shape of the scenery, the angle of light, etc., and then draw a rough sketch in pencil on a thick piece of paper according to the size of the size to be projected, and carefully consider the position of the scenery and the mutual shadow. When the sketch is completed, prepare the projection equipment, and before projecting, put the sketch on the paper to be projected to test the scenery of the negative. If it is consistent with what I and the sketch planned, project it in turn after the test. Each projection must be checked with a sketch once to make it accurate. However, the author must have superb surgery, be quick in work, and have all the bamboo in his chest before he can be handy.</p>
<p>What should be paid attention to when combining in the album of photos is that the angles of the scenery of each group of negatives must be equal, the light must be in the same direction, the size of the objects must be arranged according to perspective, and the time sequence of the scenery must also be taken into account. In short, everything must be consistent with the impression obtained by human eyes in nature, otherwise it will lose its authenticity and become counterproductive. As for the same direction of light, it refers to the strong sunlight and shadows. If the weather is cloudy and the light is flat and there is no excessive black and white light and shadow, then only measure the situation to connect it. This kind of picture is also impossible to specify the direction of light. And this kind of negative is actually the most suitable material for joining, and it is easier to join than those with strong light and shadow. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Wang Zuolin Kidnapping Case: Three Key Suspects Arrested, Victim Rescued, Suspects Detained for Investigation</h3>
<p>Wang Zuolin, a native of Wuxi and owner of the Fu Chang Xiang Yan Ke shop at No. 3 Xiang Yu Lane, Da Zhu Tang Street, French Concession, residing at No. 182 Fu煦 Road, at 11:11 AM on January 6th of this year, was with his son, Zonggan, and relative, Xi Lusheng, in his private car No. 1936. As they drove through the intersection of Fu煦 Road and Dan Shui Road, a kidnapper dressed in a police uniform, but without a number, stepped forward with a gun and</p>
<p>ordered them to stop.</p>
<p>The driver, Huang Youming, mistook him for an inspector and stopped the car. Unexpectedly, four or five more people arrived, each armed with guns. They forcibly removed Wang Zonggan, Xi Lusheng, and the driver from the car. The kidnappers then drove Wang Zuolin away themselves. Wang's family reported the case to the police for investigation. After kidnapping Wang, the kidnappers confined him on a boat, sailing and anchoring near Xujiahui in the Chinese territory. They then dispatched someone to</p>
<p>closely monitor him,</p>
<p>while sending a letter to the victim's family demanding a large ransom. However, their plans were not airtight, and on February 12th, the case was cracked by the Chinese police. At that time, in addition to rescuing the victim Wang Zuolin, they also arrested three Jiangbei men guarding the victim: Zhou A'er, Shen Dalong, and Zhu Zaoxiu. A handgun was confiscated. They were taken back for investigation. Just yesterday, the Public Concession police authorities transferred Zhou, Shen, and Zhu to the</p>
<p>police station.</p>
<p>This morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court.

<p>The Da Li steamer, owned by the British-owned Eastern Shipping Company, was leased this time. After loading cargo at the Bund, French Concession, on the evening of the fourth, it weighed anchor and set sail for Haikou. While sailing in the waters of Lujiazui, the engine suddenly malfunctioned. At that time, it was low tide, and the current was quite strong. The captain ordered to turn the ship around to drop anchor and be next to the Da De steamer for repairs. The ship's hull was originally pointed. The tide was very rapid at that time, and there was wind and other ships passing, causing the Da Li to be hit. The upper part of the ship collided with the Da De. Some of the cargo on the deck was shaken and overturned, falling into the Huangpu River. The ship then tilted and sank. Although the crew tried their best to save it, it was ineffective. Fortunately, no crew members were killed. It is said that the ship and cargo are currently being salvaged.</p>

<h3>Grain: Speculators Insatiable, Prices Jumping by 500-600 Yuan, "Deaf and Blind" Are Needed to Make a Family Prosper, Bold Speculators Drive Prices Higher and Higher, Not Afraid of Buying</h3>
<p>Under the shroud of a speculative atmosphere, foreign rice is still being monopolized by a few households. It is impossible for people to expect it to gradually loosen. Although there are many new arrivals, they are all objects of profit for orderers. The stored goods are tools for speculators to make money. Therefore, expecting the spot goods to be sold as much as possible and the market price to return to normal is truly as difficult as seeking skin from a tiger. Speculators are not afraid of public opinion, because public opinion cannot restrain their speculation. And those who have this power, it is said that "deaf and blind" are needed to make a family prosper. Therefore, the arrogance of speculators is even greater. Moreover, since domestic rice has been plundered, they are now scouring the market for foreign rice. Big speculators rely on each other, staging a double act. But fearing that they won't do this, how can they care about millions of people without food? When the market opened early yesterday morning, the situation immediately became tense. Under-the-table prices jumped by 500-600 yuan compared to the previous day. Rumors arose, and people became panic-stricken. Prices were raised and raised, shouting louder and more expensive. Small rice jumped from 2,200-2,300 yuan to 2,600-2,700 yuan per hundred bags. Saigon No. 1 rose from 2,200-2,300 yuan to 2,700-2,800 yuan. Nos. 1 and 2 and fire rice rose from 2,200 yuan to 2,400 yuan. Even broken rice, which is meant to feed the poor, rose sharply from 1,100-1,200 yuan to 1,300-1,500 yuan. Because both customers and speculators were greedy, the total transaction volume for the day reached more than 20,000 bags.</p>
<p>After the sudden decline in the domestic rice market the day before, yesterday it still showed a soft state. Because it is at the top of the price, the changes are drastic, so when the early market opened, whether it was local shops or general retail households, they all waited and watched. At that time, the sales were unusually sluggish, and the market situation showed signs of another sharp decline. Unexpectedly, most cargo owners held unique views, because they saw that the goods continued to be scarce, and they heard that the under-the-table prices of foreign rice had rebounded. They did not change their original intentions due to the sluggish sales and were very firm in their intention to sell, unwilling to loosen up, causing both sides to go in opposite directions and maintain a stalemate all the way. It was not until near noon that the market announced that it would be closed for one day today to commemorate the death of the Premier. Fearing that the source would be accumulated, and that the thin rice with weak bodies would not withstand the constant changes in the weather, and the unpredictable sunshine and rain, would not be able to be put aside and would easily change, they began to slightly depreciate and sell. As a result, the market price of thin rice fell by yuan. The opening price of Qingjiao rice was 119 yuan to 118 yuan for the rice, and 122 yuan for the original package. However, Houjing was still able to maintain the return to stability, and the opening price was similar to the previous one. The price of Kunshan rice with white rice was still 121-122 yuan, and the original package was 126.5 yuan, 126 yuan. Changbang rice with special white rice was 124-125 yuan. The supply of glutinous rice was scarce, and some speculators continued to hoard it. The market was broad, and the shouting price rose repeatedly. Hong Kong's ordinary Tuanli glutinous rice had risen from 100 yuan to 102 yuan, Weili also reached 100 yuan to 99 yuan, and the middle grade also needed 97-98 yuan, which was 1-2 yuan higher than the previous market. The special high-quality goods were completely out of stock. As for glutinous mung beans, they were opened yesterday, reaching 91.5 yuan to 90 yuan.</p>
<h3>Speculation Runs Rampant in the Flour Market, Trading Suspended, Subsidized Flour Still Supplied, Large Quantities of Foreign Wheat Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The current foreign flour market has been suspended, because speculative buying has been rampant in recent days, and the market has risen too sharply. For the sake of the food of the citizens, the authorities have temporarily banned market transactions. In the rapidly rising flour market, it was suddenly silent. It is said that direct distribution outside the market, although warned by the authorities, the selling price still stands at a high peak. However, outside speculators, seeing that the situation is not good, are secretly taking out the stock, and the price has loosened to within 30 yuan. The state-subsidized flour is still supplied as usual, with 8,318 bags released. In addition to the 5,873 bags supplied by the Fuxin Factory, the rest are sold with foreign flour, and the selling price is 15 yuan per bag, plus 20 cents for transportation and miscellaneous expenses.</p>
<p>Wheat market trading is even more a sign of stagnation. Domestic and foreign sources are scarce. The imported foreign wheat is needed by Chinese factories to make subsidized flour. The wheat in the market has long been exhausted. If you want to buy it, there is no goods. The market cannot escape the stagnant situation.</p>
<p>Foreign wheat is imported in batches.

Although people are bullish, there has been no development in new buyers. As for the securities and gold teams, in view of the downward trend in bidding prices for days, the foreign exchange market is tranquil. Because of this, they mostly tend to dump.

<h3>Piece Goods: Factory Cloth Opens Sparsely, Price of Hand Goods Also Tight</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market continued to be firm yesterday, and the reason was that customer sales had made some progress. The transaction between the industry and speculators was quite strong.

Compared to last week, there was a significant increase of about 100 yuan, with Reel silk experiencing the most substantial rise.

Consequently, there is an expectation that silk prices may rise further in the future.</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Private Schools Urge Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Directors to Increase Education Subsidies Due to High Cost of Goods Making It Difficult to Maintain Operations</h3>
<p>Over a hundred schools in the city, including Patriotic Girls' Middle School, Kun Fan Girls' Middle School, Dao Zhong Girls' Middle School, Hudong Middle School, and Zhonghua Middle School, have jointly petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese directors, Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, and Xi Yushu, requesting an increase in the amount of subsidies for Chinese schools. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted: Since the national crisis, Shanghai's environment has been unique, and the cost of all goods has soared, making life increasingly difficult. Our schools' funding largely relies on tuition fees. Currently, all school expenses are several times higher than before the war, while the average increase in tuition fees is less than 30%, which is far from commensurate with the rise in prices. The Shanghai Municipal Council's tax revenue has increased significantly each month this year, and various expenditures have also increased proportionally by more than 150%. The total amount of our Chinese education subsidies for this year should be included in the Shanghai Municipal Council's budget increase. However, our schools urgently need a large amount of subsidies, even more so than in the past, which we believe you are well aware of. We have always admired your enthusiasm for education and your benevolent nature, and we believe you will do your utmost to protect the welfare of our compatriots in the concession, which is deeply admired by all. We earnestly request that you uphold justice and, based on the increase in other expenditures, vigorously advocate to the Shanghai Municipal Council's board of directors for a broad increase in the amount of subsidies for Chinese schools, in order to meet the needs of the public and stabilize education. We rely on your wisdom and earnestly request your consideration.</p>

(Dahua News Agency)</p>

<h3>Mr. Zhu Xiaoqin, Proprietor of the Jialin Student Loan Fund, Narrates (3)</h3>
<p>Managers in the same industry often concurrently serve in foreign firms, not only to increase their personal income, but also to facilitate business operations. I successively served as a runner for foreign firms such as Shun Heng, Gonghe, and Baosheng. Whenever disputes arose, I always tried to mediate between the two parties, hoping to achieve a fair outcome. However, the parties involved often tended towards extremes, greatly differing from my intentions. Therefore, I resigned from those positions shortly after.</p>
<p>In 1925, I suddenly suffered a great misfortune. After I completed the funeral arrangements for my late father, I also dug an artesian well in the west side of the Miaogong Temple in Haining City, several tens of zhang deep and several bao in circumference, named the Lüqin Public Well, as per my late father's will. At the same time, I also dug a Shuangjie well in Xiashi Town, which belongs to the county, to commemorate my late paternal aunt's return to the Han family as a chaste woman, and the virtuous conduct of her successor wife, also as per my late father's will. My late father was a straightforward and righteous person, who lived to the age of seventy-four.</p>
<p>I managed Datongyuan for several years, increasing capital and expanding operations, which flourished daily. By 1930, the foundation was deep and the reputation was well-established. However, things unexpectedly took a turn for the worse. Misfortune arose from within, resulting in considerable losses. Coupled with the January 28th Incident, the situation deteriorated day by day. I quickly took measures to wind down the business, closing it down after five years. This was done for the sake of others and for myself, as I did not want the situation to become unmanageable.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1936, I established a student loan fund in Haining, using the name of my deceased son, Jialin, to provide loans to those in the county who could not afford to attend high school or university, since our county only had junior high schools and had suffered consecutive droughts, leading to rural bankruptcy. Those who received loans could cover their tuition, board, and lodging expenses at schools in Shanghai and Hangzhou, calculated from the time they enrolled until graduation, spanning several years. Although the number of recipients was not large, it was still a contribution, like a small grain of rice in a large pile. In the following year, on August 13th, although I suffered losses, this matter was still continued in Shanghai, without restrictions on origin, and the loan amount was reduced to tuition fees only. Up to now, there have been seven sessions.</p>
<p>My wife gave birth to one son and six daughters. The second and third sons, as well as the eldest daughter, all died young. The eldest son was Jialin, who passed away in April 1932. The second daughter, Jiazhen, is currently studying at a university. The others, Bao, Zhu, Yu, and Cui, are all in primary and secondary schools. After 1932, my concubine gave birth to two sons named Jiapeng and Jiaqiong, and a daughter named Jiafeng. I was taught by my late father to always plan thoroughly and devote all my efforts to helping others. However, the suspicion of overstepping boundaries is unavoidable, and I often face criticism. It is not that I am unaware of the importance of humility and reticence, but when righteousness is at stake, I dare not yield. My father was fond of acting as Cao Qiu for others. Over the past thirty years, he has introduced countless relatives and friends, but less than one-third have become self-reliant, and more than two-thirds have given up on themselves. Those who have succeeded are even fewer. From this, I know that the path of life is rugged, and it is frightening to stumble. Whenever I encounter young people with potential, I always offer earnest advice, without catering to personal feelings or using deceptive language. Some may resent or hate me for it, but I do not care. I value virtue first and talent second. I often compare talent to a knife and virtue to a handle. If someone has great talent but lacks virtue, then they are like a knife without a handle, sharp but unusable. I advise people to prioritize diligence and thrift, and then other things. I often compare thrift to the root, and other things to branches and leaves. Those with ambitions to conquer the world and the courage of ten thousand men, but who do not start with diligence and thrift, are often like flowers in a vase, with thousands of blossoms but not a single fruit. I have observed this for decades, and it has never failed. My way of observing and advising people is also what I use to encourage myself in ordinary times.</p>
<p>Now I am fifty years old, and I have experienced many changes. My ambitions have faded, and my life is drifting, growing old indifferently. What I cannot stop thinking about is that my two sons are still young. Looking ahead, I may not be able to fully educate and nurture them. Therefore, I rely on all of you. If you can remember my feelings today, guide and support them, and give them assistance, so that I do not make this earnest appeal in vain, it would truly be a blessing for them. (The End)</p>

<h3>The Old Master Has Money</h3>
<p>— Xu Yu</p>
<p>The Old Master said: "Money is the vanguard!"</p>
<p>If a person has a "vanguard," then no matter how rugged the world is or how terrible society is, everything will eventually turn out well. Even if you cause some trouble, it will definitely be resolved.</p>
<p>For example, our Old Master has roamed the world his entire life. Relying on his magical skills, the "vanguard" that has come under his command is more than tens of millions? Relying on his "proper allocation," he has been advancing all the way, unstoppable. Some say he is a "lucky general" on the battlefield of life. I think that is the most appropriate description.</p>
<p>That year, the Old Master was happy for a moment and had a relationship with a certain dancer. Who knew that this bitch was ignorant and actually wanted to be his wife. So the Old Master gave a shout, and the "vanguard" immediately rushed over. In a moment, the storm calmed down. The Old Master triumphantly returned in victory!</p>
<p>Since the Old Master possesses this "extraordinary talent," the things he does are naturally incomparable to ordinary people. For example, making money - the most important thing in life - ordinary people cannot even approach him slightly. He only needs one phone call, and colorful banknotes will jump in for ten thousand! Compared to simpletons like you and me, burying our heads and sweating all day, we probably wouldn't even have that amount in a lifetime.</p>
<p>"When money is gone, it will come again," this is a line from Li Bai's poem, which is also the "philosophy" that the Old Master trusts most. He often says: "I really can't understand what's the use of ordinary fools saving money? When a person dies, everything is over. Besides, making money is quite easy!" So when it comes to his "sacrificial" spirit, it is really quite astonishing. And that is why the Old Master can become a "lucky general."</p>
<p>As long as he can earn the "vanguard," then there is no need to worry about allocating the "vanguard." As a result, things will "turn bad luck into good fortune," and life can be lived in the "most interesting" way - at least that's how the Old Master often thinks.</p>
<p>Over the decades, his experiences have proven that his vision has not been shaken. So now the Old Master is even more generous in allocating the "vanguard" and even more committed to his "most reasonable" "belief." (Moreover, things are not like before now. Recruiting the vanguard is even "easier" now!)</p>
<p>The Old Master is also quite well-versed in psychology. He believes that all fools must love money, and the world is full of fools! He also believes that all those who love money must not have money; and those who do not have money are the most likely to become defeated generals in his "vanguard."</p>
<p>Therefore, the Old Master looks down on poor people as soon as he sees them. As soon as he looks down on them, he often thinks: "The Old Master has money! Humph, what are you?" So he walks with a swaying gait.</p>
<p>Swaying and swaying, the Old Master swayed past the corner of ×× Road when suddenly a young beggar came up to him:</p>
<p>"Old Master, bless you, I'm hungry..."</p>
<p>A smelly and ugly thing! The Old Master raised his foot and gave a fierce kick. Haha, the young beggar somersaulted.</p>
<p>Things got awkward. A burly man in the corner rushed up, extremely aggressively, "That's my child, how dare you—"</p>
<p>Saying that, he stretched out his fist: big and thick!</p>
<p>Seeing the situation was not good, the Old Master immediately reached into his pocket, thinking that if the "vanguard" came out, wouldn't that be enough to make them retreat? He hung a sentence "The Old Master has money" on his lips...</p>
<p>But unexpectedly, the other party's fist had already landed, cleanly hitting the Old Master's left cheek, "Who cares about your stinky money!"</p>
<p>The Old Master also did a somersault...</p>
<p>Looking at the wallet full of banknotes, the Old Master felt a little empty after all.</p>
<p>Who knew that there would be such a "cheap scum" in the world who doesn't love money!</p>
<h3>Gleanings</h3>
<p>— Wen Qiang</p>
<p>(2) Boat Filled with Water</p>
<p>A certain shipping company has recently experienced slow business and has no goods to transport. However, the ships still sail to foreign countries as usual. Because there are no goods, the weight of the ships is reduced, causing them to rock erratically. Therefore, they have no choice but to fill the ships with water.</p>
<p>Some say: This is a strange thing!</p>
<h3>Looking for a "Guarantor"</h3>
<p>— Yi Ren</p>
<p>With great difficulty, searching east and west, and expending a great deal of effort, I found a position as a small clerk in a transportation company. However, I needed a "reliable business guarantor!" For me, a poor kid with no rich relatives or noble friends, this was truly the most difficult problem. But for the sake of eating, I had to thicken my skin, muster my courage, and try my luck.</p>
<p>The first person I visited was the principal of my old school. After explaining my intentions, he beat around the bush, saying how bad the situation was in Shanghai, how difficult it was for him to be the principal, and therefore he said he had long rejected all guarantees and social interactions. He seemed to sense my disappointed attitude, and repeatedly said that he sympathized with me, but said that he had no way to help.</p>
<p>The second person I visited was a distant uncle, who was very wealthy and had a considerable position in Shanghai's business community. But when I went, he said that he had already published a notice stating that he would not act as a guarantor for anyone, so he felt that he was also unable to help.</p>
<p>I ran around for an entire day, bringing back only fatigue and disappointment.</p>
<p>The next day, with a weary step, I went to find another fellow villager. He was a wealthy "resident alien," who was quite active before the war, and currently lived a very comfortable life. After he knew my intention, he slowly narrated a story: how he had guaranteed someone to work in the ×× bank, how that person "messed things up," and how he had to pay compensation, so he declined to be a guarantor. No matter how I explained that my position was not as an accountant or cashier, but only a general affairs clerk, he always refused with "I'm sorry."</p>
<p>Walking out of this gentleman's door, I was truly filled with extreme resentment. So I went to visit a classmate who had graduated with me and was working at the ×× bookstore. My purpose was to chat and relieve my worries, not to ask him to be a guarantor, because I knew that he did not have the qualifications to be a "guarantor," he was just a small clerk. But after he knew about my situation, he insisted on being my guarantor, and told me to try.</p>
<p>I anxiously held the classmate's guarantee and went to see the company's manager. Unexpectedly, he actually approved my guarantor. So I started working.</p>
<p>"Nothing in the world is as difficult as eating," I couldn't help but softly recite as I sat at my desk and started working.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(5) The Boundary between Love and Desire</p>
<p>When he saw Luo Xiangqi, he only talked for a dozen minutes, and he felt that this was exactly the woman who completely matched his intentions. After returning to the Tianjin Hotel that day, he didn't sleep for a whole night, constantly thinking about her. But her image in his mind was too vague, and he could never imagine a clear outline. It was as if she was right in front of him, but also as if she was thousands of miles away, just like when people close their eyes, intending to imagine the face of a closest relative at home, but all they get are many vague, fragmented impressions.</p>
<p>"Is her face long or round?" He lay on the couch, staring blankly at a bright electric light. He couldn't even remember clearly whether Luo Xiangqi's face was long or round!</p>
<p>When he was thinking about her, Zhao Yukun's injury to Shen Mazi and the harassment of those hooligans had almost completely disappeared from his mind. Only one thing he could never forget was Luo Xiangqi's current status.</p>
<p>"She is the third master's concubine, and I have received some favors from the first master. Moreover, there is the relationship with Jiu Wen mixed in. How can I think about her?" He tried his best to restrain himself in a very excited state of insomnia.</p>
<p>But what's the use? When love reaches the point where it really wants to be expressed, its power will never be more moderate than a volcano about to erupt! The next afternoon, Begonia met Luo Xiangqi again in the reception room of Yuan's mansion.</p>
<p>"How do you feel about the life of singing opera?" Xiangqi used very brief words to tell Begonia that Governor Hu had agreed to help him, and then asked with an indifferent expression.</p>
<p>Begonia raised his head and smiled at a photo of Yuan the Garrison Commissioner hanging on the wall.</p>
<p>"Completely like a puppet!" The reply was very crisp.</p>
<p>Luo Xiangqi's gaze circled around Begonia's collar again, feeling even more surprised in her heart. Why can't I find any trace of the air of a singer in this young man? (52)</p>
<h3>Commemoration</h3>
<p>— Jue Hui</p>
<p>Commemoration is not just commemoration, commemoration must be found outside of commemoration!</p>
<p>For example: Today is the sixteenth anniversary of the death of the Premier, and there must be so many people to commemorate him.</p>
<p>Violation of conscience, satisfying selfish desires, forcing the poor to "have no way into the earth and no way to heaven," so they sit high on piles of rice to commemorate the Premier... Truly "alas, how sad!"</p>
<p>The Premier's death is sad; but the Premier's spirit is immortal, his heart is immortal, so it is worthy of all those who are worthy of the Premier to commemorate him.</p>
<p>The "death of a person's heart" is already the "greatest sadness"; if the heart is "alive" but does all kinds of evil, then it is even "greater sadness"!</p>
<p>Those with a "dead heart" are certainly not worthy of commemorating the Premier; those with a "living heart" who do all kinds of evil are even less worthy!</p>
<p>Commemoration is not just commemoration, commemoration must be found outside of commemoration. What is outside of commemoration? It is conscience!</p>

<h3>The Mysterious James Stewart</h3>
<p>— Zhao Ji</p>
<p>Among Hollywood male stars, the one with the best relationships is this James Stewart, who is still a bit of a kid. Because whether it is male stars who are willing to be friends with him, many female stars also want to get close to him. Even temperamental people like Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich have a considerable liking for him.</p>
<p>It's really strange. Counting his age, he is already over thirty, but when he sees strangers, he will act coy and show that he is very afraid of being embarrassed. Even the other party is often made uneasy by this appearance of his. Some say that the shyest Hollywood star is Gary Cooper, but Gary can still deal with a long string of polite remarks, pretending to be a very polite attitude. Our Stewart doesn't even know these kinds of social skills.</p>
<p>James Stewart is not only often like this in reality, but the roles he plays on the screen are also in this tone. Anyone who has seen "You Can't Take It With You" and "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" will definitely laugh at his honest and shy expression. Not only does his expression give movie fans a very deep impression, but in all of Hollywood's male stars, he is probably the only one who can do this kind of acting.</p>
<p>But the Hollywood female stars, who are willing to act with him, are willing to co-star with him. In fact, he is not the most handsome leading man, but he has a kind of inexplicable mystery. He is not an absolutely talented actor who can act, but he is not pretentious, his emotions are natural, he never puts on airs, and he can portray the personality of an honest and coy young man. People in Hollywood often shout: "Strange, why do women like to be friends with Jamie and co-star with him? Strange!"</p>
<p>The real reason is something that no one can figure out or say, but James is still a bachelor to this day.</p>
<p>Because everyone in Hollywood likes to co-star with him, stars such as Margaret Sullavan, Joan Crawford, Jean Harlow, Sonja Henie, Carole Lombard, Katharine Hepburn, Ruth Hussey, and Rosalind Russell have all worked with him; however, it is not the female lead who is noticed, but Stewart's mysterious style and typical acting skills that overwhelm the female stars who co-star with him! In the movie city, women both love him and hate him!</p>
<p>Last year, he co-starred with Katharine Hepburn, who made a comeback and returned to the screen, in "The Philadelphia Story," and won the Academy Award for Best Actor for the first time because of his excellent acting skills. The film has already arrived in Shanghai, and the test screenings have taken place. The cast is very strong, with Cary Grant, John Howard, Ruth Hussey, Virginia Weidler, etc. co-starring; the director is the famous director George Cukor of "Dinner at Eight" and "The Women."</p>
<h3>Little Singer Jin Yi</h3>
<h3>Blood Rain and Exquisite Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Two: Brave Heroes of the Northern Frontier Show Their Skills</p>
<p>Zhang Cangqiu chuckled and said, "Don't just rely on your own efforts. The times create heroes, and heroes create the times. When the Yuan Dynasty was overthrown, my Taizong rose up with the times, and heroes followed him like shadows. He was just a little monk in the Huangjue Temple, yet he was able to pacify the world. The sea can be measured by the peck, but how can one predict a person's future?" Xu Jing was silent, hearing Zhang Cangqiu speaking with such great ambition. Zhang Cangqiu was also somewhat drunk, so he asked for rice. Liu San brought the rice. Zhang Cangqiu ate three large bowls, saying, "It's been a long time since I've had rice. Today, you've treated me like a guest of honor." Then the meal ended. After washing their faces, the two men sat in the study. Zhang Cangqiu originally wanted to hurry on his way, but somehow, meeting Xu Jing today, they felt a mutual appreciation and hit it off very well. Xu Jing also found that Zhang Cangqiu seemed like a rough martial man at first sight, but his words were very bold and insightful, like a hero in the world, so he treated him with utmost hospitality. The two men talked and talked, and before they knew it, the sun was setting in the west, gradually disappearing behind the mountains. Zhang Cangqiu said, "Oh dear, I've talked too much and forgotten the time. I wonder if there's a place to stay ahead? I want to hurry to Yushan." Xu Jing said, "It's rare for us to meet. Since you're here, make yourself at home. Don't mind the humble rooms and narrow windows. Please stay here for a day or two before continuing your journey, how about it?" Zhang Cangqiu said, "Thank you for your invitation. I'll stay at your residence tonight and leave tomorrow. Just don't worry too much about me. Just have wine for me to drink, but there's no need to prepare dishes." Xu Jing said, "Good, my house has plenty of wine, enough for you to drink." Zhang Cangqiu then went outside the door to lead in that famous black horse, tying it inside the fence. He smiled at Xu Jing and said, "This steed of mine is very valuable. I need its strength to hurry to Shanhaiguan, so don't let bad people get any ideas." Xu Jing said, "Although the situation outside is unstable now, there are still no robberies or thefts in this area, but it's hard to say in the future." Then he instructed Liu San to prepare some feed for the horse. The two men sat in the courtyard, discussing martial arts. (5)</p>
<h3>A View of Life Through Struggle</h3>
<p>— Zong Yu</p>
<p>Relaxation and tension, the way of both literary and martial arts. Spiritual relaxation and tension are not about seeking momentary peace or the numbness of nerves for a short time, but about regulating the spirit, accelerating the production of new spirit, so as to continue to struggle forward with renewed vigor, thereby extending the time of struggle to infinity.</p>
<h3>My Views on Reforming Kunqu Opera</h3>
<p>— Song Ruiyang</p>
<p>The Problem of Popularization We cannot deny that Kunqu opera is too aristocratic and too elegant. Not only are the lyrics in the form of classical literature, but many of the dialogues are also in paired, rhyming four-six style, making it incomprehensible to listeners. In addition, there is a large amount of Suzhou dialect, which people from other provinces simply cannot understand. Therefore, I propose: First, since Kunqu opera is the embodiment of pure literature, the lyrics should not be changed—and they are matched with special melodies, so it is impossible to change them. Taking a step back, even if they were made popular, it would no longer be "Kunqu opera"—the only remedy is for the theater owner to print the lyrics and give them to the audience, or sell them to the audience at the lowest possible price, so that they can read the words while listening to the music, which would make it very easy to understand. Second, all dialogues in the four-six style must be changed to colloquial new spoken language, so that people can understand it at a glance. Furthermore, I hope that all dialogues will be changed to speak the national language. At the same time, Kunqu opera is a theatrical troupe that is most conducive to contraction, it can be performed on a large stage that can accommodate thousands of spectators, or it can appear on a small red carpet in a small living room, for the pure enjoyment of a very small number of people, and it has the greatest mobility, as long as a small number of actors, with a very small number of "props" and musical instruments, can "go on business". Therefore, I propose to organize many traveling troupes, performing in various parts of the homeland, so that the opportunity to be close to the public is increased, it will be more easily accepted by the public, and a part of the propaganda work and edification work can also be shared by them.</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang and Yu Zhenfei's "The Peony Pavilion"</p>
<h3>Costumes and Facial Makeup</h3>
<p>Kunqu opera is a song and dance drama, so its robes, sleeves, belts, boots, etc. are all stylized and typical, suitable for viewing, and helpful for dancing; and it is a performance of ancient events, so it is not appropriate to completely abolish the inherent costumes, but many unreasonable aspects should be modified. As for facial makeup, Mr. Zheng Zhenduo denounced it as a "reappearance of barbarism." I personally do not advocate that old opera facial makeup is a kind of extraordinary art, but under certain conditions, I also believe that some of it can be used to symbolize the personality of the characters in the play, such as using a white face for a villain, and a red-browed oily face to represent a thug, which I think can be retained. As for applying terrible, grotesque colors on the face, creating red, black, gold, and other faces that are neither human nor monster, I dare not accept it. Therefore, I think it is enough to use a little white powder, black ink, and rouge, to match the ancient saying of "powder and ink on stage." (To be continued tomorrow)</p>
