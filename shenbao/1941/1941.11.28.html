<h3>美國重申赫爾宣言　作為美日談判基礎　正式對日提出牒交靜候答覆宋子文胡適謁見羅斯福長談</h3>
<p>合衆社廿七日華盛頓電　美國政府昨日將强硬之政策聲明日本、消息靈通界認為此乃實際上結束遠東問題和解之可能、美國於最後之改變中、聞係因中國向白宮呼籲之結果、而由其預料中讓步程序轉向其重申貫之堅强政策、該項聲明稱、日本應撒退在中國之所有軍隊、並停止對南京政權之支持、作為對美任何協定之重要之最低條件、該提交來栖三郎及野村大將之聲明、其性質乃一解決太平洋危機之方案、惟該項聲明　未應允日本對美國之請求、反而聲明國務　赫爾在一九三七年所發表歷史性之原則宣言、該項明支持下列之美國政策、　領土完整及主權不得加以損壞、　商業之機會均等、　對他國內政不加干預　現狀之不干涉、（除以和平方法所覓致之變更外）</p>
<p>合衆社廿七日華盛頓電　美國政府已向日本提出方案、涉及遠東之危機、東京方面對此項計劃之接受或拒絕、將決定太平洋之戰爭或和平、此項方案或為美國之最後建議、係根據國務卿赫爾　九三七年之歷史性原則宣言、此宣言之主要基石為　維持和平　抑止於推行國策中採用武力、　以和平之談判及協定調整問題、赫爾於國務院七十五分　之會議後、將此方案提交來栖野村、國務院發言人認為此項建議、乃一包涵國務院以前所宜佈之原則之文件、該兩日本特使對此未立予評論、日本使館則謂局勢微妙、不便討論、國務院對此建議、未作任何設明、惟衆信此種程序包括若干讓步、另一「喘息」機會、容許對重要問題賡續討論、來栖未與赫爾會議以前吿報界稱、渠並不計劃即回東京、因此增加一種印象、謂某種暫時協定係在考慮中、</p>
<p>路透社二十七日華盛頓電　美國務卿赫爾昨晚與日代表會議後、經由國務院某官昌所發表措辭頗為奧妙之文吿、一般人皆認為可明白表示美國將不放棄其所抱之任何原則、以覓取與日本之妥協、赫氏所提及之基本原則、揆諸往例、似係明白指其一九三七年日本開始侵犯中國後所發之政策宣言、此項宣言曾重申美國之堅持九國公約、並拒絕承認以非和平手段所造成之領土變更、是以赫爾昨晚之文吿、已使過去四十八小時內所盛傳美國務院已準備出賣中國以期暫保太平洋中岌岌可危的和平一說、不攻自破矣、</p>

<p>合衆社廿七日華盛頓電　官方昨日宣布、國務卿赫爾已將國政府對付　　危機之計劃、交予日本來栖特使及野村大使、國務院發言人稱、此項建議為包括國務院前此所主張各原則之公文、權威界今日稱、美國主張在遠東成立已以三月為期之「喘息機會」、使美日兩國能有較充份之機會、以討論兩國間之尖銳糾紛、據稱、此種建議將交予目前正參加遠東局勢談話之來栖特使及野村大使、國務卿赫爾吿新聞記者、渠正密切注意機會、使將自上星期日以來陷於停頓之美日談話、予以早日之賡續、衆信美國此項建議將包括如日本允許不再作進一步之南進北進侵略、並允許將越南日軍重行佈置、俾不致威脅滇緬公路者、則美國願意寬弛對日經濟封鎖之一小部份云、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>論所謂臨時協定</h3>
<p>關於美日兩國代表在華盛頓所進行的試探談話，其性質非常重大，其關防也極嚴密。因此之故，除官方正式公布者外，其餘一切有關此一試探談話的傳說，都是一種局外人的揣摩推測之辭，有時近於事實，有時直是謠言，非但不能作為定論，也不値得過分重視。日來在各項紛繁複雜的外電報告中，有一項消息，謂美日間可能成立一種「臨時協定」，其為期大約以三個月為度，俾雙方有喘息之時間，以避免太平洋大戰之爆發，並布置一切，以為締結長期條約建立永久和平之基礎。其中紐約時報駐華盛頓訪員，並曾報吿有關此一「臨時協定」的具體條款四項，卽：　日本放棄在南太平洋及西比利亞東部之領土願望；　日本自越南撤軍，俾解除民治國對泰國或荷印被侵之憂慮，同時且可减少滇緬公路被擊之危機；　美國將日本在美資金之一部分予以解凍，並局部取消商業限制辦法；　日本得向海外，尤其是向越南及荷印，取給其所需之原料云云。而昨日倫敦方面，也有與此大同小異的許多報吿傳出。凡此種種消息和報吿，如前所述，都只是一種局外人的揣摩推測之辭，因為牠們都不由官方公布，未曾得到權威的證實，所以非但不能作為定論，也不値得過分重視。</p>
<p>但我人當此緊張微妙之時機，對於所謂「臨時協定」，却有在原則上一加部視之需要。所謂「臨時協定」，在外交學上，本指兩國間的短期妥協而言；可是在近年國際事務的實際應用上，則「臨時協定」語之涵義，較上述者為更廣大，卽使國際間之正式約章，倘不久卽被破壞或失其存在之價値，也都可以歸入「臨時協定」的範疇中。準此而論，則近年以來，民治國家對軸心國家實曾分別訂立多次之「臨時協定」，而其結果，這些「臨時協定」，無一不被對方所利用，以便利其作更進一步之侵略行動。所以所謂「臨時協定」，簡直就成了「不祥協定」的代名辭。</p>
<p>第一個實例，就是一九三八年四月間的英義協定。那時西班牙戰禍方殷，德國又突然以武力併吞了奧國。英相張伯倫氏，一面驚於軸心行動之急進，一面誤於苟安取巧之心理，不惜接受外相艾登氏之辭職，訂立英義協定，承認義國併吞阿比西尼亞，以拉攏義大利。張氏之意，原想藉此拆散義德間之聯繫，以孤立希特勒。而其結果，不但德義軸心未能拆散，希特勒未能使之孤立，英國自己，倒背棄了國聯，失去了立塲，並且使得那些歐陸的弱小國家，更加喪失抵抗侵略的勇氣了。</p>
<p>第二個實例，就是一九三八年九月間的明興協定。那時東南歐存在着小協約，蘇聯和法國對捷都有互助之義務，未嘗不能一抗納粹之刀鋒。而在恐怖和茍安的心理支配下，終於產生了明興協定，歐洲的集體安全，從此根本破壞，捷克西境那樣險要的要塞地帶，也全落入德人掌握。可是條約終難久恃，和平終難久保，德義兩國，似乎因此更得一種之刺激與鼓勵，過了半年，捷克全國和阿爾巴尼亞皆在武力脅迫下失其獨立，再過半年，第二次歐洲大戰也畢竟爆發，而軸心德國却占了優先了。</p>
<p>第三個實例，就是一九三九年八月間的德蘇不侵協定。明興協定中受騙的是英法，這次却輸到蘇聯上當。當時蘇聯政府之意，未嘗不以為德國將長期糾纏於對英法之爭　，正可利用一紙不侵協定，以保全蘇聯之中立與利益。不料結果恰恰中了德國各個擊破的狡計，法國旣已屈膝，南歐旣已征服，納粹的作戰機構，便東向直指蘇聯了。</p>
<p>以上是就歐洲方面，舉了三個不遠的實例。而遠東方面，如一九三九年七月之「天津英日初步協定」，一九四零年七月之「緬甸公路封鎖協定」，也都同此範疇，而且同其結果。時至今日，這一切好在都已過去了，只成為歷史上的陳跡，和歷史上的前車之鑒而已。美國政府，眼光遠大，而立塲嚴正，對於這些歷史上的嚴重敎訓，當然早已澈底認識淸楚，而不容其再有出現；或卽使對日本提出任何條件，也決不致意存苟安於一時，因為不然的話，定將遺留下來無窮的後患。所以華盛頓官方公布，美國務卿赫爾氏於二十六日提交來栖野村的方案，世人對之，在原則上不須皇惑，不必懷抱任何杞憂，而赫爾氏對中國所提出的保證，也絕對可以博得充分之信任。總之，華盛頓的態度早已確定，ABCD陣錢必難加以破壞，太平洋的大局，或和或戰，全視日本能否改變其現行之政策而定，而且也不容長期觀望與拖延，最短期內，便須作最後之決定了。</p>

<h3>蘇聯官方宣布德國違反公法</h3>
<p>被俘紅軍慘受酷刑籲請各國予以注意</p>
<p>塔斯社一十七日電　蘇聯外長莫洛託夫頃向與蘇聯維持外交關係各國大使及公使、發表于項關於紅軍俘虜被德當局慘刑處死之牒文、「在蘇聯政府訓令下、余謹以下列各點通吿貴政府、蘇聯政府現具有確實證據、證明德當局所施於被俘紅軍之有系統暴行、邇來此種證據日益增加、因而進一步證實德軍及德政府均係不顧國際公法、當紅軍被俘後、（大多數因傷被俘）均被處以酷刑而被殺戮、關於此種事實蘇聯軍事當局已獲確實證明、被俘紅軍被燒紅之鐵棍灼斃、眼被挖出、鼻被切去、肚腸破流、慘不忍睹、被俘紅軍更有被　於坦克前輾斃者、總之紅軍陷於敵手決無倖免、</p>
<p>列舉事實證明暴行</p>
<p>例如烏克蘭邦之柯第查島、最近由紅軍克復、發現無數被處慘刑之紅軍屍體、彼等手被切斷、兩目挖出、肚腸破流、又在烏克蘭里浦基村德軍撤退、吾方發現營長杜布洛夫及其他紅軍三人之屍體、彼等手足均被釘於柱上、其屍體則具有由小刀刺成之五角星形記號、其面部亦被燒傷、在北路方面，紅軍兵士奧茜波夫亦被燄火所焚斃、烏克蘭格里戈夫車站少數紅軍被俘、德方未予以飲食、數日後以刺刀將彼等刺斃、本　七月在舒來里路車站、德軍俘獲重傷紅軍一批、當場予以槍決、同月在白俄羅斯波里索夫　、希特勒黨俘獲重傷紅軍七十人、以毒藥毒斃之、八月在柴布洛鎮附近、重傷紅軍十七人被俘、三日未獲飲食、最後三人被　於竄桿上、流血而死、其餘十四人則由蘇聯坦克救出、倖免於難、在拉古鐵諾村、紅軍傷兵一名被繫於坦克二輛間、坦克輾動、該傷兵亦被撕裂而死、白楊斯克西發現紅軍屍體十一具、彼等臂及背部均經德軍用燒紅之鐵灼傷、在若干次進攻中、德以紅軍傷兵作掩護物、此種情形之發生、在列寗格勒斯摩倫斯克區等區、尤屬司空見慣、</p>
<p>臥於醫院之息病及受傷紅軍亦被德方酷刑處死、例如在斯摩倫斯克區魯特娜鎭、法西期部隊在佔領蘇聯醫院紛將傷兵護士及醫生一律槍決、女護士被德方俘獲後多有被姦淫者、至於紅軍醫藥部代表人物陷於德方手中後、亦無法倖免、例如在列寗區紅軍醫站主任賴斯塔戈亦被處死、屍體具有刺刀傷、頭肩則有彈傷、救護士包括赤夫及救護車駕駛員戈布諾夫之屍體、亦在附近發現、德方俘虜營中、紅軍兵士患疾者（如傷寒痢疾等）均未予以醫藥，在德集中營中之紅軍所受酷待已　極點、例如在波柯夫集中營中、紅軍俘虜均露宿、淸晨即由德芬軍隊以皮鞭驅作苦工、傷者及患疾者則被處死、在烏克蘭之赤諾希奴集中營、俘虜稍違德軍之意即被處死、九月十七日一日中、該集中營被處死者達九十五人之多、此外、俘虜在移動時被處死亦大不乏人、烏克蘭邦第米諾夫加村俘虜祇獲極少飲食、但無力移至另一地點者均就地被槍決、紅軍俘虜自庫拉爾移至西瑪諾夫加時、一律須跑步、力不足而停步者均立即就地槍決、</p>
<p>凡此種毬均足證明德方在紅軍俘虜集中營內所施之非人道行為、及被俘紅軍官兵所受之慘酷待遇、同時諸如此事均足顯示德政府違反德國本國代表簽訂之國際法及國際協定基本原則及條例、蘇政府特以此等可怖行動、通知與蘇聯有外交關係之各國俾對德政府稱反國際公法基本條例之野蠻行動憤然抗議、同時蘇維埃政府對德當局之違背道德酷待紅軍俘虜之行為、亦提出抗議、穗當局之非人道行動、須由德國希特勒政府負責、」</p>

<p>取締漁利將更嚴竣</p>
<p>現領事團雖未簽覆工部局、但在本週杪之前、可望獲得領事團之批准、並悉、工部局於獲得領事團之正式覆文核准之後、即將發表公報、而根除此項新附則以加緊其物價值統制、消息靈通方面相信、工部局或將在下週內、探取更嚴峻之處分辦法、俾便嚴懲一般違法之商店、蓋在目前物價之管理　則、法租界嚴於公共租界、因之法租界內商店、均能遵照所頒之限價出售其商品也、</p>
<p>局方重申處罰命令</p>
<p>據工部局情報處發表、本局統制物價機關、在過去一星期內、無日不從事於物品售價之調查、此類物品、範圍廣泛、其另售價格、業經本局正式公布、結果查得買價與限價相符者、為數不少、會在三天以內、向商店五十八家調查物品約四百五十種、其中查有超出限價之情形者、不滿十分之一、本局茲經頒發布吿、重申超越限價之罰則、根據此項罰則、凡出售物品逾越限價者、得處以三百元以下之前金。或六個月以下之徒刑。或則扣留或吊銷其執照、零售商人處售物品、經查有超越限價之情事、而其執照一經扣留。則其領照之全部房屋、應予關閉一指定之時期、至於執照之經吊銷者、該另售商人於接獲正式通知以後、應立即關閉其房屋、凡經關閉人之房屋門首、並須張貼吿白、說明關閉之理由、</p>

<p>未來情况須加預防</p>
<p>工部局統制物價辦事處稱、由於此間經濟狀况不安之故、該局認為宜向海外訂購大批麵粉、運來上海云、或問本市各貨旣有大量存底、包括囤積已久之貨品在內。則工部局何故復從海外運入價值數百萬元之物品、該員答稱、今須有大批存貨、以防航運及此間其他情况惡化、本市必須常存可供四五閱月應用之貨物、始可保證情况之安穩、航運如果失常、則各貨暫時不能運至上海、任何種物品如吿缺乏。求者必殷、結果其價飛漲、而工部局統制價辦事處、刻正致力者、即抑低物價云、該局統制物價委員會主席克朗稱、上海雖未渡物價飛漲之黑暗時期、然統制物價所已獲得之進展、及經濟情况之調整、頗可欣慰云、又據昨日消息、自工部局開始運入食油之磋商以來、食油價格已大跌、上週每擔跌落一百三十元（約四分之一）、工部局，某員謂、從該局與用戶之觀點而言、油價之跌落、可認為差堪吿慰之事、</p>

<h3>美軍第二大隊離滬</h3>

<p>（下）步上專輪</p>
<h3>美軍麥令斯風雨聲中別上海</h3>
<p>— 樂天</p>
<p>美國麥令斯隊撤離上海，引起一般人非常的注意，昨天開拔的第二大隊，計約四百人，由寇蒂斯中校率領，預定整隊游行，不料天公不美，整天風雨交作，他們便臨時變更計劃，僱了六輛雙層公共汽車，循原定路綫送上碼頭，因此依依惜別的人們，只得屏息而觀，打斷了不少的興趣！</p>
<p>當麥令斯出發之前，工部局警務處探捕，早在新關碼頭佈防，而麥令斯的憲兵，馬上也開到了，正是五步一崗，閒人莫入的模樣。隨後汽車三三兩兩，載着他們的行裝，送上曼麗馬勒小火輪。同時好奇的人，蜂擁而來，站在警戒綫之</p>
<p>女友送行外，人叢中便發現了許多奇裝豔服的西洋女郎，她們大槪是美兵的女友神色却帶幾分不樂意的愁容。</p>
<p>女友送行</p>
<p>海關鐘嗚十下，六輛雙層汽車魚貫而來，停在九號十號碼頭，麥令斯隊伍依次下車，集合整隊，全副武裝，外套雨衣，精神飽滿，一如往昔。難童敎養院軍樂隊高奏美國國歌，頓使外灘街景，威武雄壯，生色不少。國歌奏完，再奏送別之歌，Ａuldlang　Syne　這百輕快的曲調，宛如春水盪漾，使人聽了渾身柔和，許多送別的女郎，亦不期然的活躍起來，她們的情緒，難免悲苦，而行動却十分迅速；有的眼睜睜在我尋相知的人心中好不着急！有的已經找到自己的對象，嚷着哀鳴的聲浪，不到五分鐘，整百位留守的女郎，演出一慕十分緊張的塲面，於是拉手的，擁抱的，接吻的，種種熱情，盡量宣洩，甚至雙方熱淚涔涔，奪眶而出，站崗的憲兵，竟然把打得火熱而擁吻的男女，拉開一旁，驚散鴛鴦，眞是大煞風景！有一位女郎散放朶朶鮮花，五彩繽紛，一隊隊的兵踏着花瓣上火輪，想來別有一番滋味在心頭。還有一位紅衣女郎，穿了美兵所送臨別紀念的長褲，鳴咽涕泣，最能流露眞情，某兵士喊道：「哈洛，曼麗！不久再來見你！」紅衣女郎說：「密司晚罕根！你別騙我，報上不是說你們永遠的去了麽？那我我……！」古人有一句話：「別時容易見時難！」如果易地以處，這番悽慘的苦况，當然也是怪難受的。</p>
<p>揮淚話別</p>
<p>曼麗小輪將開的最後五分鐘，麥令斯司令霍華德上校，揚子江艦隊司令格拉斯福少將，萬國商團司令曼恩上校，齊來送別，觀衆中突然走出兩位長衫同志，自稱係代表「世界和平聯盟會，」由美軍中六尺五寸高的長人介紹與霍華德上校會面，其中一人以英語致詞，對美軍在滬駐防的勞續，及羅斯福總統主持世界公道與正誼，表示敬意，並高呼美軍萬歲，美國萬歲！即時送客輪汽笛嗚嗚，麥令斯一行人齊喊着：「再會吧！上海。」</p>

<h3>公債空頭占勢</h3>

<h3>洋粉略有問津</h3>
<p>安南只有苞米可運滬</p>
<p>洋米仍難開展、惟途貨則續有進口、國米有本街實銷需要、昨做開冬粳近百包、陰元六十包、北粳一百八十六元至一百八十元、薄荷一百七十四元至一百七十元、陰兀一百七十二元、均比前開續小四五元、</p>
<p>苞米由法國郵船公司　飛將軍號前日抵滬、西貢裝來苞米二萬六千零三十一包、停靠虹口公和祥碼頭起卸、聞除苞米外、另有碎米二百包、至越米不能運港、因受日軍統制之故、（祖）</p>
<p>粉市本街實銷略有問津、惟供多消細、市面續有下遊、西棧金籠過磅者祇三十六元半、不過磅者三十六元亦乏暢化、統市祇開數百包、東棧轉口粉客胃停頓、囤戶不敢問津、市乃疲而乏變、麩市亦在趨疲中、小麥到消兩稀、然日廠進胃亦頗呆滯云、</p>
<h3>雜糧起伏雖大　趨勢已疲</h3>
<p>昨日雜糧市况起洛不定、食油因日軍票先跌後漲、初開見降十多元、下午回昂十元、結果比前尙小二三元、黃豆仍趨疲勢、苞米盤旋無大榮辱、統市售開靑島生油二十五桶、大連克油九十桶、大有廠淸油二百担、塗料廠菜油一百担、日華廠菜油一百餘桶、天津新全元一千五百包又靑豆四百元、苞米現貨五百包、期貨二百多噸、豆子二十七日進口、有一千八百八十包自天津來、</p>
<h3>疋頭老是投機</h3>
<p>廠布市况、搖擺不定、蓋月底將屆到期貨塞出者甚衆、而購戶袖手旁觀、致無受主、晨市形勢甚呆、價趨下疲、然午後現金猛漲、布價突起反動、又變乏貨應市、純是投機作風、結果白貨微昂每疋五角至一元半、本街及同業賣買成交一百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　市平疲、後市回升、取引所彩球期布上午跌　五角至七角、下午因金價上騰、布隨紗漲、故十二月份收槃升至八十五元與前日比例回漲二元五角、一月份八十七元四角九分、軋漲二元九角九分、現貨龍頭廠單晨槃降至八十四元、後市人心看好，亦逐槃拉高至九十一元、四君子嗶嘰最小價跌至三元一角、晚收升至三元三角五六分、</p>
<h3>粗白略堅</h3>

<h3>淮南煤直綫下跌</h3>
<p>淮南姻煤、初因來源受阻、市上現貨缺俏，塊煤曾高至八百元光景、近日來軍票回跌、水脚成本自輕、某方亦有大批開出、暗槃不支直綫下跌、昨做折槃、淮南揀塊、每噸六百七十元、統煤六百元、較上月初最高價已跌去一百五十元盤子、</p>

<h3>限價與漲價</h3>
<p>— 霂長</p>
<p>兩和界當局自管理物價以來，市民動盪的心竟由此得鎭定了一下，雖與實際生活上的數目還有很　的距離，但飛漲之風得以戢止吿一段落，這是不得不感激當局的賢明的　置的。</p>
<p>幾日來更雷厲風行，當局表示決心，為民保障。數百種物品限價經愼重調查後次第公布。謂非德政，　誰能信？得到羣衆的熱烈擁護，可謂無以復加。前日法租界當局　根據限價章程，吊銷了若干家烟紙店的營業執照，封閉雜貨店和藥房好幾處，張貼在該店門上的公吿：「因售貨超過限價奉　務處命令停業」大家不免耳目一新，痛快之至。</p>
<p>但正在這情歡洽之時，公共租界央商電車公司却也發表一通要求，他們居然擬自下月起，增加票價百分之五十至六十，理由是「開支激增」工部局以　事小合，「決暫行置之不埋」—這賢明的措置也是値得大家擁護的，而且更希望不是「暫行」，而是「正式」，這倒決非是我們的「不合理耍求」：開支的激增要有事實的證明，人家在跌，你獨個兒要漲，這是如意算盤。猶憶平準會對於煤斤煤油也已允予結匯，大家還小是「叨光」過的嗎？公司當局對於道點不知如何打法？（另外，上海電力公司，也將附加費加以修改。）</p>
<p>同樣，法商水電公司，也在羣情歡洽之時，正式「更動」了水電價格，總計　　，電力，自來水，電車，都實行漲價，這就不得不使羣附「着急」起來，事關每一市民切身，却被當局忽略過。此眞莫明其故。</p>
<p>法租界公司電燈减費，歷歷在目，今番幡然改圖，殊有兩重風格，抑是出此「奇兵」，以掩悠悠之口，庶免有與他　物品同樣限價之要求乎？</p>
<p>天下之理，不外人情，人情　謂「不足惜」，我們是切實要求水電减價的。</p>
<h3>嚴厲實施管制物價伊始電車公司要求增加票價</h3>
<p>— 文哉</p>
<p>全滬市民期望「行」的改善</p>
<p>上海自成為「孤島」後，一，囤積居奇，大發其國難財。般奸商們肆無忌憚。操縱物價兩租界當局，深覺惡劣景象，於社會治安，大有關碍，突於本月十日，出以迅雷不及掩斗的舉動，實施其租界區內管理物價的工作，首先執行者，是市民日常主要食品的米糧，實行以來，雖　禾二旬，各種物價，已見紛紛回跌，民心亦已稍見安定，足見兩租界當局，關心民瘼，拯全滬市民，以登袵席。</p>
<p>對於民食問題，管制工作，當局之功，已收宏效，刻正擴展整頓零售物品。雖有若干奸商，利慾薰心，仍陽奉陰遠，將貨物藏之密室，或拒不照限價出售。當局為儆刁風，雷厲風行，查抄沒收，吊銷營業執照，此亦可使一般奸商心寒，投機囤積之風得以戢止，一切的物價，可入於正軌了。</p>
<p>統制物價之實施，非倉猝間所能竣事，是以當局，認為此項措施，必須逐步實行，予以詳盡之調查，否則結果，徒有弊而無利，且或反足以引起不必要之漲價，兩當局正盡其最大之努力，擴充其統制物價之機構。儘速付諾實施，甚望公衆，對當局抱忍耐與合作之精神，消滅一切不安人心與不合理的漲價。</p>
<p>時値當局止在嚴厲執行管理物價之祭，不料二十四日各報刋佈，公共租界電車公司，竟又要求工部局核准十二月日起增加票價白分之五十至百分之六十一事，不勝駭異，今該公司在當局抑平物價之際，出以要求增加票價，殊不知是何用意，使人莫測高探，抑恐市民要求核减票價，而先發制人乎？</p>
<p>夫電車及公共汽車公司，係公用事業機關，非其他一　商品商店可比，然公司車輛的票價，較之八一　前，已增　五六倍之多了，其每次增加票價的理由，為的是「滙兌續縮，燃料來源不繼，各項物價無不劇漲，發給職工津貼，以致開支激增，公司方面投資純益减少」等辭語，但現市匯兌平穩，煤斤來源絡繹，存底充沛，且有廉價的燃料購得，而乘客照常擁擠，收入並不减少，各種物價下降時，該公司突來要求增加票價，頗莫明所以。市民於工作上時間關係，對「行」的問題「尙嫌未會解決，假使而不趁車輛，兩脚走走，一雙鞋子，一雙襪，起碼　　十元左右，乘坐車輛的話，每日往返的車費，已不勝其負擔，若路較遠而繁忙者，其車費佔每月薪酬十分之一二，幸和界當局，以該公司自本年九月間，會增加票價達五成之多，且刻正積極抑平其他一切物品價格，電車應在現時有增加票價之舉，對於公司之要求，決置之不理，足證租界當局，在此時際，體恤民艱，深明大義，顧對於現時市民「行」的問題，進一步計謀改善之策，則全滬市民必更期望殷切矣。</p>
<h3>小便一次大洋六角</h3>
<p>編輯先生大鑒：</p>
<p>恕我不作客套了。本月十七日下午四時半，途徑霞飛路×××大戲院，因小便急甚，乃入內想佔一「方便」，詎知該院收票員定要我向售票處購一票方可小便（但該院小便處並非設在場內）雖再三聲明，終是不允，是時，因小便更急，大有當場出彩之醜態，無奈，出洋六角，向售票處購得一票，入內小便一次，即作廢紙（因我有要事，自己放棄觀電影特權，特此聲明）想生活程度雖高，然小便一次，大洋六角，尙是創聞，是特懇借貴刋一角，以揚仁風。　湯超英敬上</p>
<p>編者按：×××大戲院似非專為路人小便而設，此或為觀衆之特權耳；然與人「方便」即目己「方便」，乘人危急之際，形同關卡，强解仁囊，尙有不合。至足下放棄觀電影特權，此不過「買櫝還珠」之意。總之事雖出乎緊急，不妨做得坦白些，庶幾免得人家有利可圖。</p>

<p>一張長長的桌上，坐了十多個人，除了三四個看雜誌的以外，有兩個看申報，（每人以份）一個看止言報，一個看神州日報，兩個看中美日報（每人一份）兩個看新聞報，（每人一份）還有五六個人閑着雜坐在看報人的中間，這是一羣候補者，我也是其中一個。</p>
<p>本來像申報新聞報等張數較多的報紙，儘可平鋪在桌上，兩個人合看，可是他們中間除了一份正言報有個學生模樣的人，把報完全攤開，給坐在旁邊的人同看，其餘的幾位，都像受過訓練一樣，一律把四五張報紙齊着報夾對合起來，一個人看，有時我們——一羣候補者——頭向前注視一下，他們不是把他們的頭，手故意來障碍你的視綫，就是很快的翻過去換一張看，他們大有報紙是我的，你們怎麼能看的意思。</p>
<p>這裏，我得鄭重聲明，我並不是苛求看報的人一目十行，很快的看完，但我認為重看却大可不必。何况故意障碍人家視錢，以為一個看來得舒適，或者存着報是我先拿着，別人就沒權利在旁邊一同看，這是最不好的惡習。</p>

<p>「那末，—…梅寳，…快把…把那柄椅子拉過來…快斟茶…！」平日，秋海棠對於這一位頂頭上司的威風實在領敎得太够了，漸漸地養成了一毬恐懼心，今天他的顏色儘管特別溫和，說話儘管特別親切，可是秋海棠的心裹，總覺得像見了一個邪神一樣的害怕，便來不及的催促梅實着坐　茶。</p>

<h3>我偸偸地告訴你些　攝電影的魔術　（上）</h3>
<p>— 前笨</p>
<p>銀幕上的東西，都是似是而非的。譬如雪景就是用泡米造成的，所以好萊塢從外間運來的食物，最大宗的是泡米了。在好萊塢下雪的日子眞少，倘如要在這些日子攝影，也因爲天色太黑攝不出好鏡頭來，反不如用巨大的電風扇把泡米四週吹揚起來，更爲相像。所以以後你再看見銀幕的雪景時，無疑問的不知若干噸的泡米被花費了。</p>
<p>衣裳和傢具布被墨水染汚，那種損失決不是洗濯一回就可以賠償的。在銀幕上如果需要這種塲面的時候，是用一種名叫「華斯達西亞」汁來代替墨水的。此種汁有墨水之功且容易洗凈。銀幕上演員的跌倒灰泥里，他們是用一種和水的粉代替它。油漆也是如此，蜜糖是當作漆用的。</p>
<p>甚至於麵包也有特殊的功用。這里要提醒你銀幕上一塊磚頭，一條棍擊傷了演員，都用不着可憐他的。原來磚棍之類也者，都是用麵包做的。好萊塢攝影塲都沒有一種機器，專製磚形棍狀的麵包，拿它打在身上，痛癢也不覺得。</p>
<p>銀慕上的瓷瓦亂飛，玻璃亂擲，都是騙人的把戲而已。不是好萊塢製片家捨不得這筆錢，實在因爲它反映光綫太甚。所以用　製的糖片代替它。造成杯盆碗碟，唯肖唯妙，甚至於那要擊破的玻璃　，也是用大塊的糖片造的。</p>
<p>無論何時何地，肥皂泡侵人眼內或口內，總是很不愉快的。電影片當然有許多塲合，需要演員弄肥皂泡進眼或口內，那豈不是苦了他們。但且慢替他們叫苦，藝術不要它如此犧牲。他們也有一種代用品來代替肥皂泡呵！那是乳精，攝影起來倒眞十足像肥皂泡的，所以在你以爲演員口里進了肥皂泡，其實他吃了乳精呵。疲乏的馬口吐白沫，也是乳精造成功的。</p>

<h3>At the Closing of the Political Council, Chairman Chiang Elucidates National Policy, Cherishing the Belief in Victory for China's Future of Resistance and Reconstruction, Urging Councilors to Assist the Central Government in Implementing Key Policies</h3>
<p>Chongqing: At the closing ceremony of the Second National Political Council, Second Plenary Session, Chairman Chiang delivered a closing address, the gist of which is as follows: "Today, we hold the closing ceremony of the Second Plenary Session of the Second National Political Council. Looking back over the past ten days of the meeting, and especially recalling the contributions the Council has made to the nation in the three years since its establishment, I feel deeply gratified and inspired. Whether in spirit, speech, or responsible attitude, this Council can serve as a model of democratic governance. Since the start of the war, the whole nation has been of one mind and united. [Text Obscured] This Council has gathered wise and talented individuals from across the country to lead the people in a common struggle, making particularly great contributions to the war effort. The practicality of the proposals and the thoroughness of the discussions at this meeting have been more perfect and progressive than in previous sessions, fully demonstrating the spirit of striving for the nation and the people. Everyone has met with sincerity and worked together in harmony, truly embodying the spirit of sharing weal and woe. The 'Promotion of Democratic Governance' resolution passed yesterday, as well as the 'Government's Administrative Guidelines for Domestic and Foreign Affairs in the 31st Year,' are particularly important and can bring comfort to the people and the soldiers at the front. The Assembly has conducted a detailed review of the reports submitted by the government on military, diplomatic, internal affairs, financial, economic, and educational matters, and has provided concrete reports. These review reports, along with various proposals, can be adopted by the government. On the other hand, the responses to the reports and inquiries submitted by various government ministries to the Council have been truthful and candid, without concealment. The government's respect for the Council and the Council's self-discipline are both in line with the spirit of democratic governance in advanced countries' parliaments. This is a unique feature that should be highlighted in this session. Regarding economic matters, my colleagues have paid special attention, diligently studying and providing solutions, demonstrating their enthusiasm for the people's livelihood and their particular concern for the key plans of resistance and reconstruction, and the people's suffering, truly living up to the people's expectations. At present, the cause of the war is becoming increasingly important and arduous. My colleagues are deeply concerned about the future of the war. This recognition of the nation's difficulties is sufficient to promote the united efforts of the government and the people, transforming worries and troubles into light. What you are particularly concerned about is the maintenance of financial and economic stability, which the government also considers a matter of great importance. However, we have been at war for over four years, and our certainty of victory is increasing day by day. This is unimaginable in ordinary countries. Therefore, the whole problem lies in our spirit and our efforts. At present, not only is the economic problem worthy of our concern, but military and internal affairs must also be diligently improved, without the slightest negligence. We firmly believe that there is no difficulty in the world that cannot be overcome. The more dangerous and difficult things are, the more they can hone our will and lead to success. As for our country's economic problems, we must recognize two points: First, China is an agricultural country. As long as there is a supply and source of industrial machinery, the basic needs of the people's livelihood can be self-sufficient. Four years of sustained warfare have already shown results. As long as the government takes appropriate measures and the people work together in unity, we will never suffer from lack of clothing or food. I have always held this view, and based on this view, I have decided on our national policy of fighting to the end. As the ancient saying goes, 'Sufficient food and sufficient troops.' Our country has no fear of food shortages, so the economic problem will certainly not affect the military operations. Our brains are our conscience. Our hands are our abilities. If we exhaust the mental and physical strength of 450 million people to give full play to their conscience and abilities, what difficulties cannot be overcome? What cause cannot be successful? After more than four years of warfare, hardship and difficulty are inevitable. However, the lives of the majority of Chinese workers and peasants are, generally speaking, no lower than before the war. In some areas, they are even more prosperous than before the war. This is the most solid foundation for our war effort. As for the lives of educators, civil servants, and officers and soldiers at the front, they are indeed difficult. The government must make painstaking efforts to maintain them. These people are all outstanding citizens, with a patriotic spirit of sacrifice, enduring hardship without complaint, which is an excellent phenomenon. Therefore, in summary, there is no cause for concern about our war economy. I believe that our government and people must be deeply concerned about strengthening economic support, considering improvements and implementing them. At the same time, we are confident that there is no cause for concern about our war economy and that we can be optimistic, especially this year. Recently, the future of the war has become even brighter. It is like building a mountain; we are only one basket of earth away from completion. I hope that all our compatriots will work together in unity and strive sincerely for the country and the nation, so as to achieve our goals. Victory is assured. I participate in this Council, and at the same time, I am in a position of responsibility in the government. I have several other points that I would like to contribute to my colleagues: (1) You have carefully reviewed the government's achievements in administration. On the government's part, there may be shortcomings in our efforts, and there is room for adjustment and improvement. However, I dare to say that the government's wisdom may be inadequate, and the abilities of government officials may be limited, but our sincerity in working for the country, for the people, for the revolution, and for the war has never wavered or been forgotten. The government's colleagues strive to be sincere and impartial. Sincere and without deception, impartial and selfless, upholding this public sincerity, we strive for the country. This is comforting to the colleagues of the Council and does not fail our own responsibilities. China is a country with a vast land and a large population, and its environment and historical legacy are more special than those of other modern countries. During this period of war, our tasks are particularly arduous. To achieve our inevitable mission with a society whose original foundation is weak, we cannot rely solely on government orders. We must have the wise and talented individuals of the whole country to work together with sincerity and concerted assistance to achieve success. What the government particularly expects from this Council is that the Council's colleagues will enthusiastically assist in the current efforts to implement various key policies of the Central Government. The major ones include the implementation of the new silk system, the reform of the land tax to collect in kind, the establishment of a national and autonomous financial system, and the unified promotion of military service, etc. These are all unusually heavy and arduous tasks. We must have the Council's colleagues act as the government's eyes and ears and the government's hands and feet in various localities. On the one hand, we must enthusiastically enlighten and promote the people; on the other hand, we must supervise and support governments at all levels in order to promote smooth implementation. There is one more point to be emphasized: the implementation of constitutional government is an important legacy of the Founding Father and a consistent policy of the National Government. The government is constantly thinking of implementing constitutional government as early as possible. Therefore, the efforts of the National Government have always been focused on urging the completion of local self-government in order to cultivate a true democratic foundation. Only in this way can the implementation of constitutional government be solid and consolidated. This is a certain and unchanging principle. The Council passed a resolution to promote democratic governance yesterday, and the Executive Yuan also passed the Provincial Council Regulations at the same time, which can be said to be a response to the same call. In short, the government hopes that the implementation of constitutional government will be as fast as possible and as early as possible. There is no situation in which the country has reached the stage of starting constitutional government and has the conditions for implementing constitutional government, but the government does not implement it. The National Government is a revolutionary government with doctrines and goals, and at the same time, it is absolutely responsible to the country and has great determination to implement democratic politics. The government's policy cannot violate the Three Principles of the People. Not only is there a set direction, but there is also a set of steps. Therefore, we must overcome all difficulties and achieve constitutional government, which is exactly the same as the Council's expectations. I hope that the Council's colleagues and the wise men of the whole country will supervise the government and assist the government so that it can fulfill its mission. During this important period of war, what we all follow is the Three Principles of the People, the founding principle of the country, and the program for resisting the war and building the country. Under this common goal, the government and the wise men of the whole country must be open and sincere with each other to achieve the goal of national unity and sharing weal and woe in order to overcome the difficulties of the country. The government and all patriotic people in the country should not harbor any suspicion or doubt, but must be frank and sincere, and take a cooperative attitude. If we do this, the strength of resisting the war and building the country will be greatly increased, and then we will not fail the country or the nation. This General Assembly ends today. All of you colleagues have worked very hard during the session. Finally, you will return to your respective localities. The opportunity is rare, and there is a feeling of reluctance to say goodbye. But our common hope is to make the next meeting more progressive than this one and to increase the strength of the war effort with each passing day. I hope that all the colleagues of the Council will maintain the consistent sincerity of the past three years and work together for the war effort and national reconstruction. Therefore, after returning to your localities, you will still be as enthusiastic as you were during the meeting, encouraging your compatriots to fight together, and at the same time, assisting the government as much as possible, especially giving me personal guidance, working together with one heart and one mind, so that the political situation will become more progressive and the national affairs will become brighter, so as to complete our mission."</p>

<h3>Lattimore Studies the Northeast Problem</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Ta Kung Pao reports a confirmed source that Chiang Kai-shek's political advisor, Owen Lattimore, has recently been diligently studying various aspects of the four northeastern provinces.

<h3>Japanese Troops Still Attempting to Attack Yunnan, Japanese "Guangzhi Shimbun" Reports</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese "Guangzhi Shimbun," which often reflects the opinions of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, recently stated that the concentration of Chinese troops on the northern border of Vietnam is a serious threat that the Japanese cannot tolerate. It is estimated that there are about 300,000 Chinese troops stationed near the border. It is not yet known how the Japanese will advance their front lines to deal with this military situation, but Kunming is the center of China's current position, and may be within the scope of the Japanese operational strategy. If the scope of the Japanese strategy extends to the Burma Road, which is currently the only lifeline of Chongqing's military machinery, then a large-scale battle will definitely occur in Yunnan Province.

Alas, the pillar collapsed, and Heaven lost a wise man. The previous parting has become eternal separation. Not hearing from the river, we cherish your pure virtue. Mr. Bohong had a profound and brilliant mind, benefiting future generations of students. When the Lugouqiao Incident broke out, he was filled with righteous indignation. When he came to the capital, he assisted in the rejuvenation of the country. Mr. Jiluan was a master of the forum, knowing himself and knowing his enemy, deeply and thoroughly. He promoted national policies and refuted Japan's arrogance. His magnificent pen was uncompromising. Mr. Junren ascended to the central government early. In the past, he negotiated with dignity. [Text Obscured] Building the country, we planned and considered together. Alas, the three gentlemen passed away in the middle of their careers. The experienced and prudent people have withered, and our hearts are deeply wounded. The victories in the north and south herald the prosperity of the nation.

<h3>U.S. Reaffirms Hull Declaration as Basis for U.S.-Japan Talks; Formally Presents Note to Japan Awaiting Response; Soong Tzu-wen and Hu Shih Meet with Roosevelt for Extended Conversation</h3>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 27th: The U.S. government yesterday issued a strong policy statement to Japan. Well-informed sources believe this effectively ends the possibility of reconciliation on the Far Eastern issue. In this final shift, the U.S., reportedly due to appeals from China to the White House, reversed its expected concessionary approach and reaffirmed its consistent, firm policy. The statement declares that Japan should withdraw all its troops from China and cease support for the Nanjing regime as essential minimum conditions for any agreement with the U.S. The statement, submitted to Saburo Kurusu and Admiral Nomura, constitutes a plan for resolving the Pacific crisis. However, the statement did not grant Japan's requests to the U.S. Instead, it affirmed Secretary of State Hull's historic declaration of principles in 1937, which supports the following U.S. policies: Territorial integrity and sovereignty must not be impaired; Equal opportunities for commerce; Non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries; Non-interference in the status quo (except for changes achieved through peaceful means).</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 27th: The U.S. government has presented a plan to Japan addressing the Far East crisis. Tokyo's acceptance or rejection of this plan will determine war or peace in the Pacific. This plan, perhaps the U.S.'s final proposal, is based on Secretary of State Hull's historic declaration of principles from 1937. The main cornerstones of this declaration are: Maintaining peace; Restraining the use of force in pursuing national policies; Adjusting issues through peaceful negotiations and agreements. Hull submitted the plan to Kurusu and Nomura after a 75-minute meeting at the State Department. A State Department spokesperson stated that the proposal is a document encompassing the principles previously announced by the State Department. The two Japanese special envoys did not immediately comment. The Japanese embassy stated that the situation is delicate and not suitable for discussion. The State Department did not elaborate on the proposal, but it is widely believed that this process includes some concessions, a "breathing space" to allow for continued discussion of important issues. Before meeting with Hull, Kurusu told reporters that he had no immediate plans to return to Tokyo, further reinforcing the impression that some kind of temporary agreement is under consideration.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 27th: Following Secretary of State Hull's meeting with the Japanese representatives last night, a rather subtly worded statement issued by a State Department official is generally seen as a clear indication that the U.S. will not abandon any of its principles in seeking a compromise with Japan. The basic principles mentioned by Hull, as in the past, appear to be a clear reference to his 1937 policy declaration made after Japan began its aggression against China. This declaration reiterated the U.S.'s adherence to the Nine-Power Treaty and its refusal to recognize territorial changes achieved through non-peaceful means. Therefore, Hull's statement last night has dispelled the widespread speculation over the past 48 hours that the U.S. State Department was prepared to sell out China in order to temporarily preserve the precarious peace in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 27th: Secretary of State Hull yesterday personally presented a document to the Japanese special envoys. It is said that the document is based on the principle of non-aggression advocated by Hull for many years, so acceptance by Tokyo is viewed with considerable skepticism. According to a State Department official who spoke to reporters, the document is a "blueprint" for U.S. efforts to achieve peace in the Pacific, the result of numerous meetings over recent weeks. It was submitted to the Japanese side yesterday after an hour-long conversation between Hull and Nomura and Kurusu. Afterwards, Nomura and Kurusu left the State Department together, wearing smiles but remaining silent. Last night, well-informed circles viewed the document as an offer from the U.S. If accepted by Japan, it could at least bring about a temporary truce in the Pacific. Diplomatic circles believe that if Japan ceases armed aggression, including aggression against China and occupation of Vietnam, and seeks to build commerce through peaceful means, then the principles often articulated by Hull could be translated into practical conditions for peace in the Pacific. However, Japan's first step must be to conclude an agreement with the U.S., clearly stating that Japan has no intention of attacking Singapore or the Dutch East Indies, and is willing to end the war against China through friendly arbitration or other means.</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 27th: Officials announced yesterday that Secretary of State Hull had presented the government's plan for dealing with the crisis to Japanese special envoy Kurusu and Ambassador Nomura. A State Department spokesman said that this proposal is a document encompassing the principles previously advocated by the State Department. Authoritative sources said today that the U.S. is advocating a "breathing space" of three months in the Far East, allowing the U.S. and Japan a fuller opportunity to discuss the sharp disputes between the two countries. It is said that this proposal will be presented to special envoy Kurusu and Ambassador Nomura, who are currently participating in talks on the Far East situation. Secretary of State Hull told reporters that he is closely watching for opportunities to resume the U.S.-Japan talks, which have been stalled since Sunday, as soon as possible. It is believed that this U.S. proposal will include a partial relaxation of the economic blockade against Japan if Japan allows no further southward or northward aggression and allows the redeployment of Japanese troops in Vietnam so as not to threaten the Burma Road.</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Washington, 26th: Soong Tzu-wen, Chairman of the Bank of China, accompanied by Ambassador Hu Shih, met with President Roosevelt for 45 minutes at 2:30 PM today. There is much speculation about the content of the conversation between Soong, Hu, and the U.S. President, but both Soong and Hu declined to comment when interviewed by reporters.</p>
<p>U.S. Upholds Justice; China Absolutely Trusts</p>
<p>Reuters, Chongqing, 27th: The anxiety felt by all sectors of Chinese society since the commencement of U.S.-Japan talks in Washington has now transformed into trust and optimism. The Chinese now know that the U.S. will not, as some commentators have suggested, "sell out China," and will likely insist on the withdrawal of Japanese troops from China and uphold China's sovereignty. If Japanese troops attack the Burma Road, Britain and the U.S. will certainly provide China with full assistance. The authorities have not made any announcements regarding the recent ABCD four-power conference held in Washington, but based on the current situation, China seems quite satisfied with the outcome of the conference. At the same time, there are various clear indications that China, Britain, and the U.S. are proceeding with consultations in complete harmony. The positive plans adopted by the British and American authorities in the Far East regarding the Chinese legal tender are sufficient to demonstrate that the British and American members of the Stabilization Board are now proceeding with their program to protect China's legal tender and address various economic problems in the Chinese interior. The U.S. military advisory group is now working closely with the Chinese military authorities. General Shang Zhen is the director of the Chinese officers assisting the advisory group, assisted by He and Huang, both of whom received military training in the U.S. The National Government's recent decision to send Huang Bingheng, former commander of the Chinese Air Force, to Washington as an Air Force attaché will also enable closer cooperation between the Chinese and U.S. Air Forces. It is said that the National Government will also send an Air Force attaché to London, but the appointment has not yet been made.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Guo Meets with British and American Ambassadors; Firmly Opposes Appeasement of Japan</p>
<p>United Press International, Chongqing, 27th: Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi met separately with the British and American ambassadors today. Details of their talks were not disclosed, but it is understood that they discussed the U.S.-Japan talks.</p>
<p>United Press International, Chongqing, 17th: Propaganda Minister Wang Shijie stated officially today that China would rather endure a fierce attack by Japan than see any country in the ABCD alignment appease Japan. When asked what Japan would likely do if the U.S.-Japan talks broke down, Wang replied that Japan would, at most, intensify its attacks on China. "We are fully prepared for their attack. In fact, we would rather endure this intensified attack than see any country in the ABCD alignment appease Japan." As a result, China absolutely trusts all countries in the ABCD alignment, especially the U.S. government. China has never lost its confidence. China does not want to ease the economic blockade against Japan, because easing this blockade now would be the most dangerous form of appeasement.</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 27th: Amid widespread rumors that the U.S. and Japan are seeking to conclude a limited agreement to avoid war in the Pacific, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy stated yesterday that China is of course opposed to appeasement of Japan, but China will temporarily tolerate any limited agreement regarding the Pacific. This statement was issued after Secretary of State Hull consulted with the ABCD countries.</p>
<p>U.S. Firmly Rejects Japanese Demands; Key to War or Peace in Far East Lies with Japan</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 17th: According to responsible sources, U.S. and Japan have failed to find a way to peacefully resolve their differences. Whether there will be war or peace in the Far East will hinge on Japan's future actions. Although the contents of the document delivered by the U.S. Secretary of State to the Japanese representatives yesterday have not been officially released, a pessimistic atmosphere seems to have permeated the country. According to one authoritative diplomatic correspondent, Japan's response to last night's important document may be an attack on the Burma Road. There is much speculation here tonight as to whether Hull and Kurusu will continue to hold discussions. Official sources have clearly refused to make any conjecture about this. However, there is much speculation that Kurusu will soon return to Tokyo. It is believed here that the situation in Vietnam will occupy a very important position in the discussions between the two sides, as Japan's continued occupation may be seen as a continued threat to Singapore and the Burma Road. According to responsible sources, the U.S. has rejected any Japanese demand to cease aid to China.</p>
<p>British Newspaper Reveals Key Points of Agreement; Success or Failure of Negotiations is 50/50</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 27th: Following reports that a U.S.-Japan agreement is unlikely, there are now reports that the U.S.-Japan talks will focus on establishing a temporary, limited agreement. If successful, this could at least delay the risk of a U.S.-Japan war for several months. However, whether this can be achieved is currently unpredictable, as it is still unknown whether the U.S. is willing to accept the concessions that Japan is willing to offer. This approach also depends on China's attitude. Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands have in fact already placed their interests in the hands of the State Department, as previously mentioned. As for China, although the aid that China has received and can expect to receive under the Lend-Lease Act will naturally make China consider such a limited agreement, China still maintains its independence. Although Tokyo is making calls for no concessions, it is said that Kurusu has made some concessions, indicating that Japan is now more concerned with avoiding a Pacific war than with fulfilling its Axis obligations. Rumors say that the concessions offered by Kurusu include the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Vietnam, Hainan Island, and a small island between Borneo and Vietnam occupied several years ago. What Japan is demanding is unknown, but it must be something that Japan considers extremely important. If the U.S. were to recognize its demands, it would inevitably be detrimental to China. Therefore, while the Chinese side here cannot be described as optimistic, it is at least anxiously watching. Observers speculate that Japan's minimum demand will be a relaxation of economic sanctions and a supply of gasoline. If the U.S. were to make concessions on this, Japan would be better able to conduct its war of aggression against China, which the U.S. has undertaken to assist with supplies to resist Japanese aggression. As far as is known here, China's position is that now that Japan has clearly indicated that it is increasingly feeling the pain of economic sanctions, this is the time for the U.S. to increase its pressure and not slacken it. China's four years of fighting single-handedly give China reason to expect the U.S. to do so. The inner workings of the State Department's meeting room have not yet been disclosed, and there is no indication of whether the U.S. is willing to make concessions and what kind of concessions it is willing to make. However, it is said that China will continue to present its reasons here, hoping that economic sanctions will continue, so that Japan's difficulties in conducting war in China or expanding the war to other countries will increase day by day. A well-informed foreign affairs report stated that Kurusu compared Japan's actions in China with the U.S.'s actions in Central and South America in the past, believing that these were all natural and legitimate acts to protect financial and economic interests. This statement immediately sparked a debate over the U.S.'s long-abandoned interference in Central and South American affairs. Kurusu issued a warning regarding the withdrawal of troops from China, saying that there would be unrest in China if Japanese troops withdrew. The report also stated that the U.S. government must inform Kurusu of its determination to destroy Hitlerism and Japan's interest in maintaining neutrality in the European war. The difficulty in forming a limited agreement lies in Japan's insistence on continuing the war against China and its unwillingness to abandon its ambition to dominate China. According to some important figures, the prospects for the success of a limited agreement are no greater than the chances of failure. In other words, the issue of war or peace is still 50/50. Most observers believe that the outcome of the talks will not be delayed for long. Naval circles in various countries believe that the majority of the U.S. fleet should remain active in the Pacific until Japan's compliance with any agreement can be considered fully reliable.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 27th: British newspapers seem to hold different views on the outcome of the U.S.-Japan talks in Washington. The "Times" Washington correspondent is not optimistic at all, while the "Daily Mail" correspondent says that there will soon be an important announcement regarding the progress of the talks. According to reliable sources in Washington, the most likely final agreement is roughly as follows: The British and American governments will no longer insist that Japan withdraw from Manchuria; The Japanese government agrees to negotiate a truce agreement with China separately, and this agreement will contain provisions for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops from southern and central China; Japan may be allowed to station troops in French Indochina, but Japan agrees not to make any further attempts to advance southward; The U.S. government will begin to relax the economic blockade; The Japanese government gives a guarantee not to cooperate with the Axis powers, nor to use materials obtained from the U.S. to undermine U.S. interests. However, the "Times" correspondent pointed out the following obstacles to the resolution of the ongoing situation: The two sides are far apart, as both sides admit, so a general solution to the Pacific problem is impossible; The Japanese government has not changed its determination to resolve the war against China by force; Japan's adoption of such a stubborn attitude towards various events related to China has caused great difficulty. The "Times" correspondent also said that people in the U.S. Navy have a feeling that until a truly reliable method is firmly established, the U.S. still needs to maintain a great force of the U.S. Navy in the Pacific, even in times when it urgently needs to use its navy elsewhere. The inescapable relationship between the Atlantic and the Pacific must be taken into account when considering grand strategy. Although well-informed sources believe that it may be possible to avoid war in the Pacific, the chances of success for any solution, even a temporary one, cannot be regarded as better than those of previous ones. Such is the opinion of the "Times" correspondent, which is significantly different from what the "Daily Mail" correspondent said.</p>
<p>Tokyo Receives Report; Continues to Exert Threatening Pressure on U.S.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 27th: This evening, newspapers here are printing in large characters the telegram from Washington that U.S. Secretary of State Hull has delivered a formal document to Japanese Ambassador Nomura. The telegram also said that the direction of U.S. policy is now well known, so there is no need to publish the contents of the note delivered to the Japanese diplomat. People here believe that this may indicate that the U.S. has not changed its previously repeatedly announced basic ideas.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 27th: Last night, the National Broadcasting Company heard a broadcast from Tokyo Radio, saying that Japan has lost all hope for a peaceful outcome of the talks in Washington between U.S. Secretary of State Hull and Japanese special envoy Kurusu. The radio reporter broadcast in Portuguese to Brazil, saying that what the U.S. is interested in is obvious imperialism, which can be proven by its occupation of Dutch Guiana. The reporter also warned South America to beware of U.S. imperialism.</p>
<h3>Thailand Appeals to People to Strengthen Domestic Front, Beware of Fifth Column Conspiracy; Thai Prime Minister to Deliver Broadcast Speech</h3>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 27th: Today, Bangkok Radio mentioned a report from Chongqing that Japan incited the recent Thai border incident in order to test the reaction of Britain and the U.S., saying that no Japanese violations had ever occurred on the Thai border. Thai radio also broadcast an appeal to the Thai people to strengthen the domestic front. An official radio commentator warned listeners to pay special attention to the dangers of the fifth column and urged people not to unintentionally reveal national secrets in idle talk and to beware of attempts by foreign spies to bribe them.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 27th: Thai Prime Minister General Phibunsongkhram is scheduled to broadcast to the nation at 9:00 PM today (Bangkok time).</p>
<h3>British Commander in Malaya Inspects Sarawak</h3>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 27th: Lt. Gen. Heath has departed for Sarawak to inspect the troops stationed there. Sarawak is an independent country under British protection and one of the most important oil-producing centers. Previously, the area relied almost entirely on police and local volunteers to maintain its defenses. The stationing of troops under the command of the Malaya Command in the area may indicate that the possibility of a sudden Japanese attack to gain a foothold on Borneo has now actually arrived.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>On the So-Called Temporary Agreement</h3>
<p>Regarding the exploratory talks being conducted by the representatives of the U.S. and Japan in Washington, their nature is extremely important, and the secrecy is extremely tight. Therefore, apart from what is officially announced, all other rumors related to these exploratory talks are speculations by outsiders, sometimes close to the facts, sometimes outright rumors, which can neither be taken as a conclusion nor deserve excessive attention. In the various complex foreign dispatches in recent days, there is a report that a "temporary agreement" may be established between the U.S. and Japan, lasting for about three months, so that both sides have time to breathe, to avoid the outbreak of a Pacific war, and to arrange everything in order to establish a long-term treaty and build a foundation for permanent peace. A Washington correspondent for the New York Times has even reported four specific terms of this "temporary agreement," namely: Japan abandons its territorial aspirations in the South Pacific and eastern Siberia; Japan withdraws its troops from Vietnam, so as to alleviate the concern of civil countries that Thailand or the Dutch East Indies will be invaded, and at the same time can reduce the crisis of the Burma Road being attacked; The U.S. will unfreeze a portion of Japan's funds in the U.S. and partially lift commercial restrictions; Japan can obtain the raw materials it needs from overseas, especially from Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies. Yesterday, many reports, largely the same, were also transmitted from London. All these kinds of news and reports, as mentioned before, are just speculations by outsiders, because they are not officially announced and have not been officially verified, so they can neither be taken as a conclusion nor deserve excessive attention.</p>
<p>But at this tense and delicate moment, we need to review the so-called "temporary agreement" in principle. The so-called "temporary agreement" originally refers to a short-term compromise between two countries in diplomacy; however, in the actual application of international affairs in recent years, the meaning of the term "temporary agreement" is broader than the above, that is, even formal international agreements, if they are soon destroyed or lose their value, can also be included in the category of "temporary agreements." According to this, in recent years, civil countries have in fact signed many "temporary agreements" with Axis countries, and as a result, none of these "temporary agreements" have not been used by the other party to facilitate their further acts of aggression. So the so-called "temporary agreement" has simply become synonymous with "inauspicious agreement."</p>
<p>The first example is the Anglo-Italian Agreement in April 1938. At that time, the Spanish war was in full swing, and Germany suddenly annexed Austria by force. British Prime Minister Chamberlain, on the one hand, was shocked by the rapid advance of the Axis actions, and on the other hand, was mistaken by the mentality of temporary ease, and did not hesitate to accept the resignation of Foreign Minister Eden, and signed the Anglo-Italian Agreement, recognizing Italy's annexation of Abyssinia, in order to win over Italy. Chamberlain's intention was to use this to break up the connection between Italy and Germany, so as to isolate Hitler. As a result, not only was the German-Italian axis not broken up, and Hitler was not isolated, but Britain itself abandoned the League of Nations, lost its footing, and made those small and weak countries in continental Europe even more lose the courage to resist aggression.</p>
<p>The second example is the Munich Agreement in September 1938. At that time, there was the Little Entente in Southeast Europe, and the Soviet Union and France had obligations to assist Czechoslovakia, and they could not but resist the edge of the Nazi knife. Under the control of terror and temporary ease, the Munich Agreement was finally produced, and the collective security of Europe was fundamentally destroyed from then on, and that dangerous fortress area in the western part of Czechoslovakia also fell into the hands of the Germans. But the treaty was difficult to maintain for a long time, and peace was difficult to guarantee for a long time. The two countries of Germany and Italy seemed to be even more stimulated and encouraged by this. Half a year later, the whole of Czechoslovakia and Albania lost their independence under the threat of force. Half a year later, the Second European War finally broke out, and Axis Germany occupied priority.</p>
<p>The third example is the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact in August 1939. What was deceived in the Munich Agreement was Britain and France, but this time the Soviet Union was tricked. At that time, the Soviet government did not think that Germany would be entangled in a dispute with Britain and France for a long time, and it could use a non-aggression pact to preserve the neutrality and interests of the Soviet Union. Unexpectedly, the result was precisely the trick of Germany's divide-and-conquer tactics. France had already yielded, South Europe had already been conquered, and the Nazi war machine pointed east directly at the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The above are three recent examples from the European side. And in the Far East, such as the "Tianjin Anglo-Japanese Preliminary Agreement" in July 1939, and the "Burma Road Blockade Agreement" in July 1940, are also in the same category, and with the same results. To this day, all this is in the past, only to become historical relics, and historical lessons from the past. The U.S. government has a long-term vision and a solemn stance, and of course has long recognized and cleared up these serious lessons in history, and will not allow them to reappear; or even if it puts forward any conditions to Japan, it will never intend to seek temporary ease, because otherwise, it will certainly leave behind endless troubles. Therefore, the U.S. Secretary of State Hull's plan submitted to Kurusu Nomura on the 26th, which was officially announced in Washington, need not be panicked in principle, and there is no need to harbor any worries, and the guarantee that Hull has given to China can absolutely win full trust. In short, Washington's attitude has already been determined, and it will be difficult to destroy the ABCD front, and the overall situation in the Pacific, whether war or peace, depends entirely on whether Japan can change its current policy, and there will be no long-term observation and delay, and the final decision must be made in the shortest period of time.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting on the Moscow Front Reaches Decisive Stage; German Offensive in the Tula Region Halted; Red Army Counterattacks Victorious in the South</h3>
<p>International News Agency, 27th, Kuibyshev Electric Dispatch: As the intense fighting between the Soviet and German armies continues, yesterday's "Pravda" reported that German infantry and mechanized units have been stopped south of Moscow, but continue to make progress in the northern sector of the Soviet capital's arc-shaped defense line. According to the newspaper, since the Red Army inflicted terrible losses on the advancing German forces, the German forces advancing from Tula have been stopped south of the Soviet capital. However, it also acknowledged that in the far south of the Soviet capital, a German unit has broken through the Soviet army's flanks and is now in a position to completely encircle Moscow. Furthermore, exciting news from the southern front states that the Soviet army has repelled the German forces there, forcing them to retreat six miles further northwest of Rostov. It is acknowledged here that the great battle of Moscow has now entered a decisive stage, and the fate of the city may be decided in the battles of the next few days.</p>
<p>Reuters, 27th, Moscow Electric Dispatch: Recent Soviet communiqués state that the fighting in the Volokolamsk and Stalinogorsk districts on the Moscow front is extremely fierce. Another report states that well-trained and fully equipped fresh Soviet forces have been deployed to fiercely attack the German forces that are still desperately trying to occupy Moscow.</p>
<p>TASS, 27th, Moscow Electric Dispatch: The German offensive against Moscow has been going on for ten days. The enemy initially planned to advance along the shortest route to Moscow, but due to the strong resistance of our army, it has changed its strategy to attack Moscow from the north and south. At the same time, fascist generals are seeking the closest stronghold to Moscow. The details of the fighting in the central sector are as follows: German forces in the northern sector have made slight progress, but our army has counterattacked and annihilated a German regiment. The headquarters of the 3rd Battalion, 240th Regiment of the enemy's 106th Division, was occupied by our army, and a large number of documents were obtained. The victory in this battle has curbed the enemy's progress. The fighting in the Stalinogorsk area is the fiercest. On a battle line of 12 to 15 kilometers, the Germans recklessly advanced with three tank divisions and three infantry divisions. The enemy suffered extremely heavy losses in this area. As a result of two days of fighting in the V district, the enemy lost 49 tanks, one infantry regiment, and nine artillery pieces. However, the enemy has not abandoned its attempt to advance north. The fighting in Volokolamsk is extremely fierce. Our army has prevented the enemy from advancing. The enemy's attempt to infiltrate the Red Army with small squads of infantry has also failed. In the central sector, our aircraft units are taking advantage of the good weather to increase their bombing of enemy forces. According to preliminary statistics, in one day, our aircraft formations in the central sector destroyed 60 tanks, 106 trucks, and annihilated one and a half enemy battalions. In summary, in the ten-day offensive, the enemy has moved the front line closer to the capital Moscow, and the threat has become more serious. However, Hitler's hopes for the November offensive have clearly failed.</p>
<p>Havas, 26th, From a place on the Soviet border Electric Dispatch: According to Italian sources, German mechanized units have reached the city of Podolsk, only 28 miles from Moscow. However, this news has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is Determined to Fight a Scorched Earth War; German Reinforcements Arrive in an Endless Stream</p>
<p>Havas, 26th, From a place on the Soviet border Electric Dispatch: Military observers here recently stated, "The Battle of Moscow" has reached a decisive stage. The weather on the front line is severely cold, and the frozen ground is as hard as iron. The German army is taking advantage of the weather to transport soldiers and ammunition to the front line in an endless stream. German aircraft are no longer responsible for transportation, but are focusing all their efforts on attacking Red Army positions. German motorcycle and armored vehicle units were previously unable to advance quickly due to muddy roads, but now that the ground is frozen, they continue to advance without hindrance. Therefore, Moscow is in extreme danger. However, all buildings in Moscow have been fitted with landmines. Soviet people are prepared to turn Moscow into scorched earth. It is expected that once the German army has positioned its artillery around Moscow, it will launch a large-scale bombardment of the Soviet capital.</p>
<h3>British Armored Units in North Africa Reorganized and Resume Offensive; Recapture Agedabia, Capture Hamit and Complete the Encirclement of Axis Forces</h3>
<p>Reuters, 27th, London Electric Dispatch: A Middle East communiqué announced that British tank units, after reorganization and reinforcement, today resumed their overwhelming offensive in the Western Desert, retaking Agedabia and capturing Hamit. At the same time, the troops that broke out of Tobruk have joined up with reinforcements, thus completing the encirclement of Axis forces trapped on the Mediterranean coast. The enemy forces attempting to cross the border south of Omar yesterday were broken up into small groups by the fierce attack of British armored and mechanized units. There is no new information on the British mobile units that occupied Gialo yesterday and are now advancing southwest.</p>
<p>Reuters, 27th, London Electric Dispatch: A Reuters correspondent reports from the battlefield headquarters of the Eighth Army in North Africa that the great battle of North Africa is still continuing in a dusty area of 5,000 square miles, and the outcome is undecided. British, Indian, South African, and New Zealand troops are engaged in mixed battles with German and Italian forces from Sollum on the border to Tobruk, a hundred miles to the west. The large tank battle on the British left flank south of Tobruk has lasted for five days and now seems to have temporarily come to a halt. After a German armored division participated in the battle, it had very few tanks left. Part of the British armored forces is still in contact with German tanks, while the rest are being reorganized after reinforcement. Although the activity of the armored forces of both sides has temporarily stopped, the competition between the armored forces is still extremely important, and the outcome cannot be predicted, but it may determine the progress of the entire campaign. New Zealand and South African troops have now occupied one of the two roads connecting Bardia on the eastern coast to Sollum for supplies, and the New Zealand occupation of Gambut threatens the second road. The German and Italian troops surrounded in the Sollum gorge are desperately resisting the gradual advance of the British army. German and Italian forces around Tobruk are doing their best to prevent the British garrison in Tobruk from making contact with the large British army advancing from the east. The above is a summary of the situation in North Africa last night.</p>
<h3>Soviet Official Announcement of German Violation of Public Law</h3>
<p>Captured Red Army Soldiers Suffered Cruel Torture; Appeal to All Countries to Pay Attention</p>
<p>TASS, 17th Electric Dispatch: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov recently issued a note to the ambassadors and ministers of all countries maintaining diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union regarding the cruel torture and execution of Red Army prisoners of war by the German authorities. "Under the instructions of the Soviet government, I hereby notify your government of the following points: The Soviet government now has conclusive evidence proving the systematic atrocities committed by the German authorities against captured Red Army soldiers. Recently, this kind of evidence has been increasing, thereby further confirming that the German army and the German government are disregarding international law. After Red Army soldiers are captured (most of whom are captured due to injuries), they are subjected to torture and killed. The Soviet military authorities have obtained conclusive evidence regarding this fact. Captured Red Army soldiers are burned to death with red-hot iron rods, their eyes are gouged out, their noses are cut off, and their stomachs are ripped open. Captured Red Army soldiers are even run over by tanks. In short, Red Army soldiers who fall into the hands of the enemy have no chance of survival.</p>
<p>Listing Facts to Prove Atrocities</p>
<p>For example, on the Kerch Peninsula in the Ukrainian SSR, which was recently recaptured by the Red Army, countless corpses of Red Army soldiers who had been subjected to cruel torture were found. Their hands had been cut off, their eyes had been gouged out, and their stomachs had been ripped open. Also, in the village of Ripky in Ukraine, when the German army retreated, our side discovered the corpses of Battalion Commander Dubrovin and three other Red Army soldiers. Their hands and feet had been nailed to pillars, and their corpses had five-pointed star-shaped marks made by knives. Their faces had also been burned. On the northern front, Red Army soldier Osipov was also burned to death by flames. A small number of Red Army soldiers were captured at the Grigoriev Station in Ukraine. The Germans did not provide them with food, and several days later, they stabbed them to death with bayonets. In July of this year, at the Shurairei Road Station, the German army captured a group of seriously wounded Red Army soldiers and executed them on the spot. In the same month, in Borisov, Byelorussia, Hitler's party captured 70 seriously wounded Red Army soldiers and poisoned them to death. In August, near the town of Chaibulok, 17 seriously wounded Red Army soldiers were captured. They were not given food for three days. Finally, three people were impaled on poles and bled to death, while the remaining 14 were rescued by Soviet tanks and escaped death. In the village of Raguteno, a wounded Red Army soldier was tied between two tanks, and the tanks ran over the wounded soldier, tearing him apart and killing him. Eleven corpses of Red Army soldiers were found west of Vyazma. Their arms and backs had been burned by the Germans with red-hot iron rods. In several offensives, the Germans used wounded Red Army soldiers as shields. This kind of situation is commonplace in the Leningrad and Smolensk regions.</p>
<p>Bedridden and wounded Red Army soldiers in hospitals were also cruelly tortured and killed by the Germans. For example, in the town of Rutna in the Smolensk region, fascist troops shot all the wounded soldiers, nurses, and doctors in the Soviet hospital after occupying it. Many female nurses were raped after being captured by the Germans. As for the representatives of the Red Army medical department who fell into the hands of the Germans, they could not escape death. For example, the director of the Red Army medical station in the Leningrad region, Raishtag, was also executed. His corpse had bayonet wounds, and his head and shoulders had bullet wounds. The corpses of medics, including Chief Chiff and ambulance driver Gorbunov, were also found nearby. In German prisoner-of-war camps, Red Army soldiers suffering from diseases (such as typhoid fever and dysentery) were not given medical treatment. The cruelty suffered by the Red Army in German concentration camps has reached its peak. For example, in the Pskov concentration camp, Red Army prisoners of war were forced to sleep in the open. In the early morning, they were driven to do hard labor by German troops with whips. The injured and sick were executed. In the Chernositsky concentration camp in Ukraine, prisoners of war were executed for the slightest violation of the German army's will. On September 17, as many as 95 people were executed in the concentration camp in one day. In addition, prisoners of war were often executed while being transferred. Prisoners of war in the village of Dminovka in Ukraine received very little food, but those who were unable to move to another location were shot on the spot. When Red Army prisoners of war were transferred from Kular to Shimanovka, they were required to run. Those who did not have the strength to stop were immediately shot on the spot.</p>
<p>All these atrocities are sufficient to prove the inhumane behavior of the German army in the Red Army prisoner of war concentration camps and the cruel treatment suffered by the captured Red Army officers and soldiers. At the same time, all these events show that the German government has violated the basic principles and regulations of international law and international agreements signed by representatives of Germany itself. The Soviet government hereby informs all countries that have diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union of these terrible actions, so that they can express their indignation and protest to the German government against its barbaric actions that violate the basic regulations of international law. At the same time, the Soviet government also protests against the German authorities' unethical and cruel treatment of Red Army prisoners of war. The German authorities are responsible for the inhumane actions of the German Hitler government."</p>

<h3>U.S. Military Schedule Advanced; All Troops Scheduled to Withdraw from the Philippines This Morning; Second Battalion Departed Yesterday on Ships in Grand Style; Citizens Enthusiastically Saw Them Off</h3>
<p>Howard Personally Leads First Battalion to Board Ships at 10:00 AM This Morning</p>
<p>The U.S. Marine Corps Fourth Regiment, which has lived with the people of Shanghai day and night for fourteen years and is known as the friendliest defense force in Shanghai, had its entire Second Battalion, plus part of the officers of the General Headquarters, totaling 401 officers and men, leave Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM aboard the U.S. mail ship President Madison, heading straight for Manila. Earlier, at 11:00 AM yesterday morning, they boarded a ferry from the Customs House Wharf to board the large ship. Yesterday it rained, so the farewell parade plan was canceled. The entire team changed to six double-decker buses, which took them directly from the barracks to the port. As for the remaining First Battalion, which was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai on Sunday, it was advanced because the President Harrison, which was carrying them, arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the day before yesterday and could not stay long. So they boarded a ferry at the Customs House Wharf at 10:00 AM this morning. Colonel Howard will also leave Shanghai at the same time. Today, rain or shine, the First Battalion will hold a farewell parade, and the shortwave broadcasting program will still be retained.</p>
<p>Departing in Teams on Public Buses</p>
<p>Yesterday morning's wind and rain canceled the Second Battalion's original farewell parade. After 9:30 AM, the team and headquarters officers, about 401 people, took six specially hired British double-decker buses one after another from the Xiaoshadu Road barracks, passing through Gordon Road, turning into Jing'an Temple Road, following Nanjing Road, along the Bund to the Customs House Wharf. The team was divided into five companies, each with about 70 people. The Fifth Company went first, arriving at the Customs House Wharf at 10:05 AM. Fifteen minutes later, the Fourth Company followed. By 10:15 AM, the remaining three companies arrived at the port at the same time. After getting off the bus, they lined up along the street. At the command, the team flag went first, and the entire team boarded the ship in an orderly fashion. When the five double-decker buses passed through the bustling city one after another, passers-by on the roadside waved enthusiastically to say goodbye. In addition to dispatching a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to maintain order along the way and stationing personnel at the Customs House Wharf, the police also dispatched several motorcycle-riding soldiers to guide the way.</p>
<p>Playing Marches Was Exhilarating</p>
<p>Around 9:00 AM, eight large military transport vehicles and more than ten small trucks of the U.S. Fourth Regiment transported everyone's luggage, boxes, cages, and other miscellaneous items one after another to the Customs House Wharf. Soldiers from the military transport office directed the coolies to carry them onto the ferry. At this time, more than 20 military police (referred to as MP) of the regiment arrived one after another to maintain order and manage luggage at the wharf. Lieutenant Colonel Curtis, the executive officer of the Second Battalion, personally directed at the wharf. Curtis frequently told people, "I feel deeply saddened, I really can't bear to leave." Yesterday, Colonel Howard, Major General Grasford, Social Officer Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton, and Shanghai Volunteer Corps Commander Colonel Mann were all at the port to see them off, frequently shaking hands and chatting with acquaintances. The Shanghai Orphanage Military Band of more than 40 people lined up at the eastern end of the wharf. Whenever the regiments arrived at the wharf in batches, they played marches, and the cadence was exhilarating.</p>
<p>Regiment Officers and Soldiers Spirited</p>
<p>After 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the Customs House Wharf was crowded with people, especially Western women. Most of them were there to see off their "lovers." When the ranks gradually arrived at the wharf, but had not yet boarded the ship, they cherished each other and said goodbye, unable to bear to part. And the regiment soldiers looked around, spirited. Chinese and foreign photographers were busy running around, magnesium lights flashing, and patrolmen came and went, adding to the busyness. There were also American expatriates withdrawing on the Madison, carrying boxes and suitcases, crowding the port, and the road was blocked by everyone, making it even more crowded.</p>
<p>First Battalion to Depart This Morning</p>
<p>The First Battalion was originally scheduled to withdraw to Manila aboard the President Harrison, which arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, and was eager to sail south, so it had to depart early. The ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai around 2:00 PM today. The entire First Battalion is scheduled to board a ferry at the Customs House Wharf between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM this morning. The entire team will depart from the Xiaoshadu Road barracks around 9:00 AM, and the entire team will parade, rain or shine, via Gordon Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Nanjing Road, turning into the Bund, heading straight for the port. Colonel Howard will personally serve as the commander-in-chief, and Lieutenant Colonel Huang Linai, the executive officer of the First Battalion, will assist him. The regiment military band will accompany the team to play music. At that time, the streets will be empty, and the grand occasion will be no less than the withdrawal of the British army last year. The police will dispatch a large number of detectives along the way to maintain traffic and take care of the situation to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>Two U.S. Gunboats to Withdraw Next Month</p>
<p>After the farewell parade, there will be a farewell broadcast. From 10:00 AM to 10:15 AM, a special shortwave broadcast will be held at the Customs House Wharf to transmit to various parts of the United States. Social Officer Hamilton and Mr. Mackay of American Express Bank will be responsible, and the latter will be responsible for reporting. Mr. Mackay will give a wonderful description of the situation of the procession, so that the people far away in the United States will know all about the withdrawal of the Fourth Regiment, which has a glorious history of 14 years in China. At that time, Major General Grasford, commander of the U.S. Yangtze River Fleet, and Colonel Howard, commander-in-chief of the regiment, will give speeches respectively. It is also learned that the U.S. Yangtze River Fleet stationed in China will also have a partial withdrawal in early next month. The gunboats Wahoo and Wake will leave Shanghai for Manila. It is hoped that the Wake will arrive in port from Wuhan today, but Major General Grasford will station the flagship Luzon here until the situation is irretrievable, and will never withdraw.</p>
<p>The Exact Number of U.S. Troops Who Left Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>The Madison was ordered to come to Shanghai this time to transport the withdrawing U.S. Marine Corps Fourth Regiment to the Philippines. The Second Battalion consisted of 334 soldiers and 67 officers. In addition to carrying Marine officers and soldiers, the mail ship had 66 American expatriates traveling to Luzon to return to the United States. The President Harrison mail ship carried the First Battalion this morning and was scheduled to leave for the Philippines at 1:00 PM. The two mail ships brought a large number of goods from the United States this time, and did not load any export goods at all. All were loaded with the regiment's base equipment and the luggage of officers and men.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Seeks to Strengthen Control: Suggests to the Consular Body Requesting Additional By-laws to Grant Greater Power</h3>
<p>Yesterday Reaffirmed Penalties for Profiteering</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) authorities are currently pursuing established strategies for the management and control of prices within the Settlement to fulfill their original resolution to suppress general price levels. According to information obtained by a Pingming News Agency reporter from reliable sources last night, the SMC authorities are now seeking to intensify their management and control of general prices within the Settlement. They have recently submitted a new proposal to the Consular Body, requesting approval to add new by-laws to the Land Regulations for the Yangjingbang area. This would empower the SMC to strengthen and reinforce its authority to control prices.</p>
<p>Crackdown on Profiteering to be More Severe</p>
<p>Although the Consular Body has not yet responded to the SMC, approval is expected before the end of this week. It is also understood that the SMC, upon receiving formal approval from the Consular Body, will issue a public announcement to implement these new by-laws to tighten its price controls. Reliable sources believe that the SMC may take more severe measures within the next week to severely punish stores that violate the regulations. Currently, price controls are stricter in the French Concession than in the International Settlement, so stores in the French Concession are able to sell their goods in accordance with the price limits set.</p>
<p>SMC Reaffirms Punishment Orders</p>
<p>According to the SMC Information Office, the SMC's price control agency has been investigating the prices of goods daily for the past week. These goods cover a wide range, and their retail prices have been officially announced by the SMC. The results show that many prices match the set limits. Within three days, approximately 450 types of goods were investigated in 58 stores, and overpricing was found in less than one-tenth of the cases. The SMC has now issued a public notice reaffirming the penalties for overpricing. According to these penalties, anyone who sells goods above the set price may be fined up to 300 yuan, imprisoned for up to six months, or have their license suspended or revoked. If a retailer is found to be selling goods above the set price and their license is suspended, all buildings covered by the license will be closed for a specified period. If a license is revoked, the retailer must immediately close their buildings upon receiving formal notification. A notice must be posted on the door of any closed buildings, explaining the reason for the closure.</p>
<p>Receipts Can be Requested for Purchases at Controlled Prices</p>
<p>If a buyer discovers that the price of purchased goods exceeds the set limit, they can submit the receipt to the SMC's "Price Control Office" for verification. The receipt must indicate that the goods were purchased after the price controls were implemented. In addition, a letter must accompany the receipt, stating the buyer's name and address for verification purposes only. The SMC is taking the above measures to fulfill the mission announced in its notice issued on the 9th of this month, declaring the SMC's determination to crack down on profiteering in essential foods.</p>
<p>Original Notice Stipulated Penalties</p>
<p>The full text of SMC Notice No. 5621 is as follows: "Notice is hereby given that all retail stores selling any goods for which a maximum price has been set by SMC Notices No. 5596 and 5611 or any other notice must issue receipts. Retailers are hereby notified that if they sell goods subject to price controls at prices exceeding the limits published by the SMC from time to time, they will be punished in accordance with By-law 53 of the Land Regulations. The penalties are (a) the penalties prescribed in Article 17 of the Land Regulations, or such other penalties as the competent court deems fair, (b) the suspension or revocation of their license by the SMC, or (c) both (a) and (b) simultaneously. The penalties prescribed in Article 17 of the Land Regulations are 'a fine of no more than 300 yuan, or imprisonment for a period of no more than six months.' This notice is hereby given. November 27, 1941. E.F.Goodale, Chairman and Director-General"</p>
<p>Future Situations Must Be Prevented</p>
<p>The SMC Price Control Office stated that due to the unstable economic situation here, the SMC believes it is advisable to order a large quantity of flour from overseas to be shipped to Shanghai. When asked why the SMC would import goods worth millions of yuan from overseas when there are already large stocks of various goods in the city, including long-stored items, the official replied that it is necessary to have large stocks to prevent deterioration in shipping and other conditions here. The city must maintain a stock of goods sufficient for four or five months of use to ensure stability. If shipping is disrupted, goods cannot be transported to Shanghai temporarily. If any kind of goods are in short supply, demand will be high, resulting in soaring prices. The SMC Price Control Office is currently working to suppress prices. Mr. Crane, Chairman of the SMC Price Control Committee, said that although Shanghai has not yet passed through the dark period of soaring prices, the progress made in price control and the adjustment of the economic situation are quite gratifying. According to yesterday's news, since the SMC began negotiating the import of cooking oil, the price of cooking oil has fallen sharply, dropping by 130 yuan per dan (approximately one-quarter) last week. An SMC official said that from the perspective of the SMC and consumers, the drop in oil prices is considered a satisfactory event.</p>
<p>Appeal from the Thrift Committee</p>
<p>The Shanghai Thrift Movement Committee issued a statement yesterday, urging all industrial and commercial sectors in the city to act conscientiously and take practical steps to suppress prices in order to ease the burden on citizens. It also encouraged citizens to practice thrift to overcome the current difficulties and avoid being eliminated by the times, thereby ensuring a stable life.

<h3>U.S. Marines Depart Shanghai in Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>— Le Tian</p>
<p>The departure of the U.S. Marines from Shanghai has attracted considerable attention. The Second Battalion, consisting of approximately 400 men led by Lieutenant Colonel Curtis, set sail yesterday morning. A parade had been planned, but unfortunately the weather was unfavorable, with wind and rain throughout the day. They temporarily changed their plans, hiring six double-decker buses to travel along the original route to the wharf. As a result, those who came to say goodbye could only watch silently, which dampened their enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Before the Marines departed, detectives from the SMC Police Department were stationed at the new Customs Wharf, and the Marines' military police also arrived immediately, creating a scene where one could not enter without a permit. Subsequently, buses arrived in twos and threes, carrying their luggage, and were sent to the Manli Maller small steamship. At the same time, curious people flocked to the scene, standing outside the cordon.</p>
<p>Girlfriends Say Goodbye. Among the crowd, many Western girls in bizarre costumes were discovered. They were probably the girlfriends of the American soldiers, with rather unhappy and worried looks.</p>
<p>Girlfriends Say Goodbye</p>
<p>As the Customs clock struck ten, six double-decker buses arrived in succession and stopped at Piers 9 and 10. The Marines disembarked in order, formed up, fully armed and wearing raincoats, and looked as spirited as ever. The Nan Tong Boys’ Home military band played the American national anthem, immediately making the Bund street scene majestic and adding a lot of color. After the national anthem was played, the farewell song, Auld Lang Syne, was played. This hundred light and brisk tune, like spring water rippling, made people feel gentle all over. Many of the girls who came to say goodbye also became active unexpectedly. Their emotions were inevitably sad, but their actions were very fast. Some were anxiously looking for acquaintances, which made people feel very anxious! Some had already found their objects and were wailing. In less than five minutes, hundreds of girls who were staying behind staged a very tense scene. So, pulling hands, embracing, and kissing, all kinds of passions were vented as much as possible, and even both sides were in tears. The military police on guard even pulled the hot and kissing men and women to the side, dispersing the lovebirds, which was really disappointing! One girl scattered bouquets of flowers, colorful, and teams of soldiers stepped on the flower petals to the fire wheel, which must have had a special taste in their hearts. There was also a girl in red trousers who was wearing the long trousers sent by the American soldiers as a parting souvenir, sobbing and crying, which best expressed her true feelings. A soldier shouted: "Harold, Mary! See you again soon!" The girl in red said: "Miss Wan Gen! Don't lie to me, didn't the report say that you were gone forever? Then I, I...!" There is a saying from the ancients: "It is easy to say goodbye, but it is difficult to see each other!" If we were to put ourselves in their shoes, this miserable situation would certainly be very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Waving Tears Goodbye</p>
<p>In the last five minutes before the Manli small ship was about to depart, Marines Commander Colonel Howard, Yangtze River Fleet Commander Rear Admiral Glassford, and Shanghai Volunteer Corps Commander Colonel Mann came to see them off. Suddenly, two comrades in long robes walked out of the audience, claiming to be representatives of the "World Peace League." Introduced by a six-foot-five-inch tall man from the U.S. military, they met with Colonel Howard. One of them gave a speech in English, expressing respect for the hard work of the U.S. military stationed in Shanghai and President Roosevelt's commitment to world justice and righteousness, and shouted "Long live the U.S. military, long live the United States!" Immediately, the whistle of the passenger ship blared, and the Marines shouted in unison: "Goodbye, Shanghai."</p>

<h3>Old Man's Will: Founding a School, Funeral Expenses Used as Aid Money, Sheng Mujie Respects His Ancestor's Wishes and Sends Funeral Expenses to This Newspaper to Assist the Poor</h3>
<p>The scholarship committee of this newspaper received a letter from Mr. Sheng Mujie yesterday, saying, "I respectfully inform you that my late father, Jian Donggong, was a philanthropist during his lifetime. Before the war, he was determined to establish a free elementary school to give poor children the opportunity to receive education. Unfortunately, his ambition was not fulfilled, and the August 13th Incident occurred, and his family property was wiped out. All the businesses in Wuxi could not be restored. Therefore, for the past four years of the war, he has been living in the countryside, often lamenting the state of his country. This June, he was bedridden, and on October 30th, he unfortunately passed away, at the age of sixty-five. Before he passed away, he often said to his unfilial son that he regretted not being able to see the restoration of his country and that his ambition to build a school was not realized. Now, I have received funeral expenses from friends in Shanghai. In order to follow my late father's will, I have specially collected 200 yuan and donated it to your newspaper for scholarships, hoping to express my late father's will and to bless the friends who sent the funeral expenses." According to Mr. Sheng's letter, he shows the utmost filial piety and kindness to children. His late father was affected by the war and was almost bankrupt, but his patriotism and love for his hometown never waned. Before his death, he repeatedly urged that funds be used to build a school. The old man's story can make people think deeply.</p>
<p>Applications Must Follow Procedures</p>
<p>Recently, this committee has received many letters applying for scholarships or requesting free or half-price schools. However, this committee stipulates that applicants must come to the office in person to obtain an application form and follow the procedures before it can be processed. Applications submitted only in writing cannot be accepted. The application forms are being printed urgently, and a public announcement will be made as soon as they are printed so that you can collect them.</p>
<p>Total Scholarship Amount Nearly 40,000</p>
<p>The following donations were received from readers in the past two days: Mr. Sheng Mujie, 200 yuan; Mr. Ye Qiyu, 100 yuan; Mr. Li Wenjie, 50 yuan; Mr. Hu, 40 yuan; Mr. Ye, 20 yuan; Mr. Sun Jitang, 10 yuan; Ms. Mei Juan, 5 yuan; Anonymous (receipt number 947), 5 yuan; (Mr. Ma Zhensheng, 2 yuan, donated by donors for the Diamond Wedding Anniversary of Sir Ho Tung, designated to be donated to the scholarship fund of this newspaper) The above totals 432 yuan.

<h3>U.S. Consul General Lockhart's Condition Greatly Improved</h3>
<p>The U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Lockhart, contracted typhoid fever about a month ago and was admitted to the hospital for treatment. He has now greatly recovered and is expected to be discharged from the hospital in a week. According to a spokesman for the U.S. Consulate General, Mr. Lockhart is now able to sit quietly in an armchair for half an hour in the morning and afternoon. After being discharged from the hospital, he will take a vacation to rest, but it is unknown whether he will rest in Shanghai or elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Severe Earthquake Felt in Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to astronomical observatories in London and New York, there were records of severe earthquakes. According to information from the Xujiahui Observatory, the Xujiahui Observatory in Shanghai also has records of this earthquake. The time was 18:21:18 on the 25th of this month. The location of the earthquake is predicted to be approximately 8,667 kilometers from Shanghai, but the direction cannot be determined.</p>
<h3>Criminal Report of the French Police Department</h3>
<p>The number of criminal cases in the French Concession in October was the same as in the previous month. Three patrolmen from the French Concession Police Department were killed, and three other patrolmen were injured. The details are described below. At 10:30 pm on October 15th, four Chinese people (including three kidnappers and one banker who had just been kidnapped in the Public Concession) were approaching the post of a Chinese patrolman on Avenue Joffre. The hostage asked the patrolmen for help, and the kidnappers immediately opened fire on the hostage and patrolmen, killing the hostage. Two patrolmen were injured. Other patrolmen arrived after hearing the alarm and helped to chase the kidnappers. As a result, Inspector Lu Dianrong, patrolman No. 845, and the hostage were killed by the bandits. Chinese patrolmen No. 69 and No. 1268 were injured. The bandits were finally captured by the police. One of them was killed, another was injured, and the third bandit was not injured. The patrolmen who participated in the operation were all courageous.</p>
<p>In addition, patrolman No. 458 was killed by Russian patrolman Gutriyarev on October 28th. The police department deeply regrets the tragic death of the Vietnamese patrolman. The Russian soldier was detained in the Central Police Department for violating discipline, and he was trying to escape at the time.</p>
<p>Detective Shen Jinshu was about to board a trolleybus on Rue Lafayette on October 11th to go to the police station for work when someone shot him. The detective was hit by two bullets in the back and was immediately taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment. His injuries are gradually improving. In recent years, the detective has arrested many notorious thieves. Because the police department has repeatedly conducted searches, armed robberies have been greatly reduced. Before the Sino-Japanese War (when the number of residents was half of what it is now, and the number of armed gangsters was also smaller than it is now), there were an average of 17 to 18 armed robbery cases per month. In 1940, the average was 20 cases. In October, there were nine armed robbery and highway robbery cases.</p>
<p>Several gangsters, armed with knives and sticks, intended to steal. A young Korean woman jumped out of the window in panic, resulting in her death. On the evening of October 30th, two armed bandits took the pistol of the watchman of Father Du's residence. In the above-mentioned cases in October, seven pistols were seized. On October 14th, three people were seriously injured in an explosion in their home due to careless handling of explosives. The police department has detained the three people, and the case is under investigation.</p>
<p>There was only one kidnapping case this month. The victim was a 13-year-old boy. The child was kidnapped on October 28th in front of his relatives' house on Rue Say Tsong. However, he escaped and returned the next day. All three kidnappers were arrested.</p>
<p>Damage and wall-climbing theft cases have also decreased compared with July. There were 41 cases in September and only 36 in October. Nine of these cases have been solved, and 14 thieves have been arrested. In October, the police department received 47 theft cases. Seven of these cases have been solved, and 88 thieves have been arrested.</p>
<h3>Russian Bodyguard Suddenly Commits Suicide in Police Station: Caused by a Very Minor Dispute over Taxi Fare, Reprimanded and Angered, He Resorts to This Measure</h3>
<p>Leg Hok, a Russian, is currently a bodyguard for senior staff at Shenxin No. 9 Factory at 140 Macau Road, with a monthly salary of 250 yuan in legal tender. He has been in this position for more than a year. The night before last, Li accompanied the factory director, Mr. Lu, to a friend's wedding banquet at the Jinmen Hotel. At about 11:00 pm that night, Mr. Lu ordered Li to return to the factory first, because Li was living in the factory, and the factory gate had to be closed if he was late. Li then took his leave, but Li</p>
<p>Did Not Return to the Factory</p>
<p>It is not known where he stayed, and at 6:00 am yesterday morning, Li was afraid that something might have happened at the factory, so he hired a Yifei car No. 1237 to go to the factory to sign in. However, Li was penniless. After arriving at the factory and getting out of the car, Li declared to the driver, Gu Guanlin, that he would sign the receipt to owe the money. Gu refused because the company did not have such a method. The two parties were then taken to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. After asking about the reason, the police station rebuked him and waved him away. Li</p>
<p>Was Extremely Angry for a Moment, and Drew the Self-Prepared Pistol He Was Wearing, and Opened Fire on His Right Temple, The Bullet Passed Through His Brain, and Brain Juice and Blood Flew Out Immediately, and He Collapsed in a Pool of Blood, and His Breath Was Only Slight, the Police Station Quickly Summoned the Ambulance and Sent Him to Hong'en Hospital for Treatment, Because the Injury Was Serious, He Was Pronounced Dead Within a Few Minutes.</p>

Suddenly, three bandits walked up to the patrolman, pretending to ask for directions. Two bandits suddenly took out pistols to threaten him and forbade him from making a sound. Another bandit snatched the official pistol he was wearing and left. Afterwards, the patrolman returned to the police station to report the incident and began to investigate the case.</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Shaanxi Provincial Government Convenes Provincial Educational Administrative Conference: All Existing Schools Exceed Capacity, Solving the Problem of Teachers is a Top Priority</h3>
<p>(Xi'an Hangxun) Shaanxi's education has not been able to develop satisfactorily in the past due to the lack of teachers. Since the war, a large number of young students and teachers from the occupied areas have moved west to Shaanxi. All existing schools in Shaanxi have exceeded the number of students they can accommodate. Teachers have also been adequately supplemented, but due to the sharp increase in the number of students, each teacher in elementary schools has to teach more than 100 students. According to statistics from the Education Department, the number of students has doubled from the 24th to the 28th year of the Republic of China, and there are still 5 million children who are out of school. To enable them to receive education, more than 40,000 teachers are needed. Among the 1,961 elementary school teachers, only one-quarter are qualified. This is a major issue in the development of teacher education in Shaanxi. The provincial government regards eliminating illiteracy and popularizing national education as the primary task after the implementation of the new county system. Therefore, on October 27th, it convened teachers from all levels of schools and people's education centers in the province to hold a provincial educational administrative conference in Xi'an for a week, resolving 217 cases. Regarding the promotion of primary and secondary education, under the guidelines issued by the central government, and adapting to the conditions of the province, it will strive to promote the promotion of the resolution of the problem of teachers. The Ministry of Education will be requested to decide that the Northwest Normal College will be permanently established in Shaanxi so that students in the province can join the army. Shaanxi lacks rainfall, and almost all agricultural and forestry products rely on irrigation. Therefore, the study of farmland water conservancy is a top priority in Shaanxi. This spring, the provincial government allocated 3.5 million yuan as the start-up fund for the establishment of a farmland water conservancy specialized school. However, the annual operating expenses of 300,000 yuan have not yet been approved by the Ministry of Education. The provincial authorities believe that if the water conservancy specialized school is not successful, it will have a great impact on Shaanxi's production. Therefore, it will still be discussed and promoted at this conference.</p>
<h3>U.S. Church Donates Winter Clothing: Students Are Eager to Apply</h3>
<p>The YMCA and YWCA Actively Handle the Matter</p>
<p>Since the China Youth Student Relief Committee began distributing winter clothing donated by the U.S. Church, students from secondary schools in Shanghai who are poor have been very eager to apply. Especially in the past two days, the number of applicants has increased sharply. As of yesterday, the number of applicants to the YMCA had reached 600, but many people had made fruitless trips due to a lack of understanding of the application procedures. According to an investigation by a Shenjiang News Agency reporter, students applying to the China Youth Student Relief Committee for winter clothing should pay attention to the following points:</p>
<p>Four Points for Students to Pay Attention To: (1) The application qualification is for students from universities and high schools or above who are deemed qualified by the association, but regardless of gender or religious belief. (2) The winter clothing distributed includes four types: thick men's and women's coats, wool sweaters, leather shoes, and men's suits. (3) Applicants should have a letter written by the school authorities or teachers (with the applicant's recent photo attached and stamped by the school to be valid). The letter must indicate the student's academic performance, conduct, parents' names, and family situation. (4) The application place for boys is the Student Department of the YMCA at 8 Xianqiao, and the application place for girls is the Student Department of the YWCA at 323 Moore Road.</p>

<h3>Second Act of Charity Basketball Game: Lianxing and Shanghai Xing Win Both Games</h3>
<p>Shanghai Xing Breaks 100, Lianxing Defeats Lanbai; Yan Chengde Buys Charity Ball for 1,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The four-team charity basketball tournament hosted by Yueqing Middle School held its second act last night at 8 PM at the YMCA in Baxianqiao. The audience still reached over a thousand people. As a result, Lianxing defeated Lanbai with a score of 20 to 15, and Shanghai Xing defeated Baillemen with a score of 29 to 27. Lianxing and Shanghai Xing won both games. The finals will be held at the same location tomorrow night. The first act was Lianxing vs. Lanbai. The former is a rising new Western and Chinese mixed team. They defeated Baillemen last time and have a strong reputation. The latter is one of the three strongest Chinese teams. The game between the two sides was quite</p>
<p>evenly matched.</p>
<p>After the initial contact, Lianxing's captain Chen Xuechong made three consecutive shots, and Qu Xilin added the finishing touch, leading 8 to 0. Lanbai accelerated, and Bao Songyuan made a contribution to return the score. Lianxing's Tao Bolinji also returned a shot. Lanbai's Li Zude and Chen Bangzhen made free throws, and Wang Nanqun scored with a clever shot. Lanbai chased the score to 8 to 10. Lianxing's Kong Guangyi made a long-range shot. The first half ended with Lianxing leading 12 to 8. After the break, Li Zude and Bao Songyuan successively made free throws, making the score 10 to 12 again. The score approached for the second time, but it was only a fleeting moment. Lianxing's Chen Xuechong and Kong Guangyi hit the target again. Soon after, Chen Xuechong left the field with four fouls and was replaced by Zhang 　Lun. Lanbai took the opportunity to counterattack, but ultimately failed to reverse the defeat due to bad luck. Lianxing defeated Lanbai 20 to 15, creating a great record of two wins in two games. In the second game, Shanghai Xing played against Baillemen. Baillemen's Wang Jinghu and Lu Dazhen were absent and Wang Nanzhen participated to help out. After the start of the game, it was purely</p>
<p>Shanghai Xing's World</p>

Baillemen's Wang Nanzhen cleverly made long-range shots, breaking the basket and returning the score. The score difference was not more than ten points. In the first half, Shanghai Xing had 24 points and Baillemen had 18 points. After switching sides, Liang Yunming opened the scoring. Baillemen's captain Chen Xianglong left the field with four fouls. Soon after, Baillemen's Wang Wenjie also fouled and left the field. They could only fight with four players, and they felt even more unable to support. Shanghai Xing's Lin Wanli was very active, making three shots in a row. In conclusion, Shanghai Xing defeated Baillemen 39 to 27. The final between Shanghai Xing and Lianxing will be held at the YMCA gymnasium in Baxianqiao tomorrow night. Also, a charity ball was auctioned off during the break.

<h3>New Capital Actively Increases Yarn Market Prices in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>However, factory orders and forward positions still need to pay interest</p>
<p>The yarn market started weak and then rose, but the trend is still fluctuating and uncertain. In fact, cash yarn transactions are cut off, and those who have goods in hand are eagerly selling off due to the closed outlet. However, large players are still in long positions, and they pull up as soon as the market loosens. In the end, because consignees are very scarce, long positions pay a huge interest of about 5 or 6 yuan per bale every day. Therefore, the situation of both long and short sides has become a tug-of-war. The highest price for 20-count yarn was 2,515 yuan, and the lowest price was 2,370 yuan. Double 2 opened poorly in the morning, with the first lot price at 2,410 yuan. Shortly after, it rose to 2,420 yuan. Later, because the cash yarn market was not good and sellers were active, it fell to 2,370 yuan. After the price fell, profit takers covered their shorts, and at the same time, gold rebounded, rising to 2,480 yuan. After the price rose, selling and long position closing came together, and the market price loosened again to 2,405 yuan. The closing price was 2,437 yuan. In the afternoon, due to various rumors, the market jumped to 2,490 yuan at the opening. Shortly after, it fell to 2,455 yuan. Then it was heard that gold was firm and the exchange price was high, rising to 2,515 yuan. The closing price was 2,506 yuan. At present, in the yarn market, those who want to rise cannot enter, and those who want to fall cannot exit. The futures market for Jin Shuang Ma has recovered from fatigue and the trend seems to be stabilizing. When it opened this morning, it was weak at first due to dull news and pessimistic sentiment. In addition, factory orders and the gold market both fell, which inevitably caused fluctuations in long positions. Therefore, futures yarn was sold off first, and the market was temporarily shrouded in selling pressure. The December contract opened at 2,370 yuan and once fell to 2,325 yuan, while the January contract opened at a low price of 2,405 yuan, and the February contract opened at 2,510 yuan and also once fell to 2,480 yuan. Afterwards, due to rumors that the international situation had turned towards easing, sentiment greatly improved. The gold market and factory orders first stabilized, and futures yarn followed with a sharp rebound. Therefore, distant months all saw higher prices in the afternoon. In the afternoon, the news was clearer, and the long side strengthened. The gold market and factory orders soared one after another. The short side of futures yarn was panicked and rushed to cover their positions. In addition, new capital was active, and the buying sentiment in the market was very strong for a while, with demand exceeding supply. As a result of the daily fluctuations, prices generally rose by 60 to 100 yuan. The list is shown below.</p>
<p>The cash cotton situation is still sluggish, with no trading activity. Everyone is taking a wait-and-see attitude. 2,021 bales of cotton, which were shipped on the Yubian Postship "General Xiafei" from Saigon, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. The cotton is produced in Vietnam. The cargo is currently being unloaded at the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou. The New York cotton market rose due to the entry of New Orleans goods and efforts to resist covering short positions in December. At the same time, cash trade also saw very strong firmness. As a result, closing prices rose by 3 to 25 points higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market fell first due to speculative selling and cotton merchants covering short positions and closing long positions, but then rebounded due to the gradual rise in the gold market. Yesterday's closing price rose by about 1 rupee.</p>
<p>It is also predicted that today's opening market will rise by 325 rupees.</p>
<h3>Covering Short Positions, Gold Market Rebounds</h3>
<p>Recovering from a low price of 12,700 yuan to 14,700 yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market first fell sharply and then suddenly rebounded and rose. After the price broke through the 13,000 yuan mark twice, it immediately rebounded and jumped to over 14,000 yuan. People's sentiment turned from weak to firm, which proved that securities firms from Tianjin had re-entered after exiting. Short positions were covered at low prices. Although Xianghe sold 880 taels, Shunyuan sold 720 taels, and Xiangxingyong (Chaozhou group) sold 550 taels, Tianyuan and Tianjin securities firms each bought over 700 taels, Chengji bought 450 taels, Gonghe sold and then bought 320 taels, and Wanfeng also bought 150 taels. It was reported that the US and Japan had reached a temporary agreement, and the price fell to 12,700 yuan. Soon after, the market rose to 14,500 yuan before the close, rising by 1,100 yuan. The total daily trading volume was 25,540 taels.</p>
<p>Cash Falls and Then Rebounds</p>
<p>The market opened at 9:00 AM at 13,400 yuan per tael (10 taels), which was 50 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. Seeing Tianjin firms selling off and Xianghe and Decheng securities firms competing to sell, sentiment was very weak for a while and prices fell sharply by 700 yuan, falling below 13,000 yuan to 12,700 yuan. Xianghe suddenly came back in and Shunyuan, Mingfeng, Shihe, and Hongqing all competed to push up the price, which rebounded and rose by 1,050 yuan to 13,750 yuan. Xianghe, Shunyuan, Hengji, Gonghe, and Tianjin bill brokers competed to sell, and prices fell sharply again by 800 yuan to 12,950 yuan. Cash firms Yongcheng, Hesheng, Chengji, Tianyuan, and Mingfeng absorbed the selling pressure. At around 10:15 AM, the price rebounded and rose by 900 yuan to 13,850 yuan. Gonghe sold, slightly pressing down the price to 13,400 yuan. The morning close was 13,550 yuan. The market opened at 2:00 PM in the afternoon and immediately rose to 14,000 yuan in a buying frenzy, which was 450 yuan higher. Tianyuan, Xianghe, bill brokers, and securities firms actively bought, rising to 14,400 yuan. Mingfeng, Suicheng, Xiangxingyong, and Chengji sold off heavily at high prices, and prices once again fell by 550 yuan to 13,850 yuan. However, sentiment had already turned upward. Soon after, Gonghe, Hesheng, bill brokers, securities firms, and Tianjin firms came to actively buy again, and the price rose by 650 yuan to 14,500 yuan. The market closed at 4:00 PM at 14,450 yuan, which was 1,100 yuan higher than the previous day. The daily range was 1,800 yuan. The retail price of cash firms' own brand gold was 14,600 yuan, and the purchase price was reduced by 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Rises by 100 Yuan</p>
<p>The price of ornamental gold changed five times in the morning. The initial price was a low of 1,320 yuan, and then it rose to 1,700 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose twice again, reaching 1,470 yuan. The purchase price was reduced by 150 yuan, and the price rose by 100 yuan. Silver was still priced at 22 yuan per tael, and the black market price was 16 yuan.</p>
<h3>Black Market for Foreign Exchange Lacks Activity; Foreign Currency Slightly Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market, the central bank and HSBC's listed prices did not change. HSBC's small table price did not change. The black market for British and American exchange was quite stable. Although the remaining long positions of Chinese businessmen speculators were eager to sell, they were unwilling to cut their losses. Therefore, British exchange was 2.4375 and American exchange was 3.75, and there were still no buyers. It was difficult to trade throughout the day, and the price was flat compared to the previous day. Yesterday's foreign currency market, British and American gold pounds rose by 10 yuan along with the cash price. British gold notes also rose by 1 yuan. American gold notes fluctuated greatly. In the morning, they fell to 24.5 yuan, and in the afternoon they rose to 28.8 yuan, which was 2.5 yuan higher than the previous day. Hong Kong notes also rose by 10 cents. Japanese gold notes rose by 10 cents and rose to 2.6 yuan in the evening market. Korean notes had balanced supply and demand, and the market price was stable. The evening market was still stable at the original price of 2.8 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bank Clearing House Advances Time for Collecting Notes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association Clearing House sent a circular to all banks yesterday, stating that since the change in the fixed-time exchange system on September 15th, all contracted banks have had to extend their office hours every day to wait for the Clearing House to present the notes before they can dispose of the notes for payment. The Clearing House presents the notes to all banks as quickly as possible within its capabilities, but sometimes there are still delays in delivery to the banks. The reasons are as follows: The delay of each bank in sending notes for collection from other contracted banks to the Clearing House. Although the Clearing House has stipulated in Article 7 of the Measures for Sending Notes for Collection in Circular No. 185, requesting each bank to send the notes to the Clearing House before the specified time, some banks still inevitably delay. In the future, please cooperate and try to avoid this. The banks entrust the Clearing House to collect notes from other banks, except for foreign banks. Most of the payers of the notes to the Clearing House pay by issuing checks from banks or money shops that have business dealings with the Clearing House or other foreign bank notes. The latter must be presented again until they are exchanged for checks from banks or money shops that have business dealings with the Clearing House. Therefore, a large part of the payment notes that the Clearing House should receive from each contracted bank every day are the aforementioned checks. Therefore, the time of collection of such checks is already after the collection of foreign bank notes, so the presentation of all payment notes receivable by the Clearing House from each contracted bank (ie, the 50th receivable note) cannot be earlier in fact. At the same time, the delay is also caused by each bank's entrustment to each member money shop to collect notes, and the Clearing House's presentation to each shop for payment. In order to improve this point, the Clearing House should appropriately advance the time for sending the notes for collection from foreign banks by each bank, so that the presentation of all notes receivable by the Clearing House itself can also be earlier. Now, the Notes Exchange Committee of the Clearing House has decided to revise the time for sending the notes for collection from foreign banks by each contracted bank as follows: Banks and trust companies other than contracted banks are required to send notes before 12:45 PM in the central district (before 10:30 AM on Saturdays). Money shops that are not members of the Trade Union and other Chinese foreign bank notes with a fixed price must be sent before 10:45 AM on the same day (before 10:00 AM on Saturdays). Foreign bank notes must be sent before 10:00 AM on the same day (before 10:00 AM on Saturdays). The above revised time will be implemented from December 1, 1941." It is found that the time for collecting notes has been advanced by one hour compared to the previous time, except for the notes of foreign banks and the time on Saturdays, which have not been changed.</p>
<h3>Short Positions Dominate Government Bonds</h3>
<p>In the government bond black market, the market continued to be weak yesterday. The market was very bearish and never broke through the closing price of the previous day. The situation was quite unstable. Long positions and retail investors were very active in selling off. Type C bonds broke through 9 yuan and saw a small price of 8.2 yuan. Due to negative news and new rumors, the market sentiment was still depressed. Yesterday morning, the opening price of Type C bonds was 69 yuan, and it was slightly higher by 30 cents. After that, it declined sharply. Renfeng, Xiexing, Yuanjiufeng, and Dahua bought, but the sellers' supply exceeded demand. Firms such as Tongyi, Dazhong, Dingkang, and Renfeng and the 25th Shengsheng sold off very actively. The smallest price of Type C bonds was only 8.2 yuan. After that, Xiexing, Yuan, and Dazhong increased their bets and raised the price to 9 yuan at the close. In the afternoon, Hongda and Runde slightly increased their appetite. Xiexing and Yuan turned to sell, and Dingkang continued to sell. Juxing also sold off. The market was still sluggish. Type C bonds closed at 8.75 yuan. The small price of Type D bonds was 4.5 yuan, which was 2.3 yuan smaller than the previous day's price. The market price ended up being 20 cents to 1 yuan smaller across the board. The trading volume was about 2 million yuan. A simple table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 500 shares of ABC Underwear Company were traded at a price of 15.75 yuan.</p>
<p>The stock market of Zhongye was consistently quiet. Prices slowly fell. Second-class stocks equally declined. Both buyers and sellers had no special interest. Currently, there is a letter to this newspaper requesting that a column on the Shanghai stock market be added. After investigation, the manuscripts selected by this newspaper have always been carefully considered and are not easily published unless they have a value that can be reported in Zhengzhong, so as to avoid confusion. The 18th lottery for the Shanghai Special Municipality Disaster Area Reconstruction Bonds of the Republic of China Year 21 was held yesterday at HSBC Bank in this city. It is estimated that the lottery numbers "84" and "91" were drawn, and the principal of 120,000 yuan in national currency should be repaid. Together with the 15th period interest coupon, they are all scheduled to be paid on December 15.</p>
<h3>Small Inquiries for Arrowroot Flour</h3>
<p>Annan only has corn that can be shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>Imported rice is still difficult to develop, but goods in transit continue to be imported. Domestic rice has real sales needs in this street. Yesterday, nearly 100 bags of winter japonica rice were sold, 60 bags of Yin Yuan, and 186 yuan to 180 yuan for Beij粳 rice. Mint rice was 174 yuan to 170 yuan, and Yinyu rice was 172 yuan. All were 4 to 5 yuan smaller than the previous opening.</p>
<p>Corn was shipped on the French Postal Ship "General Xiafei" from Saigon and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. There were 26,031 bags of corn, which were unloaded at the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou. It is reported that in addition to corn, there were also 200 bags of broken rice. Vietnamese rice could not be transported to Hong Kong because it was under the control of the Japanese army. (Zu)</p>
<p>The local sales of flour in the flour market were slightly inquired about, but there was more supply and less demand. The market continued to decline. Western mills weighed at 36.5 yuan, and those not weighed at 36 yuan also lacked sales. Only a few hundred bags were opened in the unified market. Eastern mills' re-export flour customers paused, and hoarders did not dare to inquire. The market was tired and lacked change. The bran market was also trending towards fatigue. The arrival and sales of wheat were rare, but the intake of Japanese factories was also very sluggish.</p>
<h3>Although Fluctuations in Coarse Grains are Large, the Trend is Already Weary</h3>
<p>Yesterday's coarse grain market fluctuated, and edible oil first fell and then rose due to the decline and rise of Japanese military notes. It fell by more than 10 yuan at the initial opening, and rose by 10 yuan in the afternoon. As a result, it was still 2 to 3 yuan smaller than before. Soybeans still tended to be weak, and corn revolved without great honor or disgrace. The unified market sold 25 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 90 barrels of Dalian crude oil, 200 dans of Dayou factory refined oil, 100 dans of vegetable oil from the paint factory, more than 100 barrels of vegetable oil from the Rihua factory, 1,500 bags of Tianjin Xinquanyuan, 400 yuan of green beans, 500 bags of spot corn, more than 200 tons of futures, and 1,880 bags of beans imported from Tianjin on the 27th.</p>
<h3>Gray Cloth is Always Speculating</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market fluctuated. Because there were many goods that were about to expire at the end of the month, but the buyers were watching from the sidelines, there was no receiver. The morning market was very sluggish, and prices tended to decline. However, cash rose sharply in the afternoon, and cloth prices suddenly rebounded. Then there was a lack of goods on the market. It was purely speculative. As a result, white goods rose slightly by 50 cents to 1.5 yuan per piece. More than 100 pieces were traded in the local and inter-industry markets.</p>
<p>The Dong cloth market was flat and tired, and the market rebounded later. The exchange color ball futures cloth fell by 50 cents to 70 cents in the morning. In the afternoon, due to the rise in gold prices, cloth rose with yarn, so the December closing rose to 85 yuan, and the ratio to the previous day rebounded by 2.5 yuan. January was 87 yuan, 49 cents, and the rolling rise was 2.99 yuan. The spot leading factory order fell to 84 yuan in the morning, and the market outlook was optimistic, and it was gradually pulled up to 91 yuan. The smallest price of the Four Gentlemen's serge fell to 3.1 yuan, and the evening close rose to 3.356 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coarse White is Slightly Firmer</h3>
<p>Recently, the source of sugar has been quite lively. If the price is high, hoarders will take the opportunity to sell. For example, yesterday's transaction volume reached more than 17,000 bags for futures and more than 8,000 bags for spot goods. The trend was slightly firmer. The Association's disc division of 24 coarse white spot goods opened at 203 yuan in the morning, then fell to 194.5 yuan, and then rose to 206 yuan. In the afternoon, it was 204.5 yuan to 211 yuan, and the closing was 0.45 yuan, which was 2.5 yuan better than the previous market. The October contract was 197 yuan to 94 yuan and 99.5 yuan in the morning, and 207 yuan in the afternoon, with a closing of 204.5 yuan, a rise of 4.5 yuan. September was 192 yuan to 96 yuan in the morning, and 203 yuan to 0.4 yuan in the afternoon, a good rise of 6 yuan. August was 171 yuan in the morning and 200 yuan in the afternoon, a rise of 5 yuan. For the November 30 futures contract, the morning was 180 yuan to 84 yuan and 87 yuan, and the afternoon was 198 yuan to 99 yuan, with a closing of 95.5 yuan, a rise of 5.5 yuan. December 10 was 195 yuan to 201 yuan and 206 yuan in the morning, and 217 yuan in the afternoon, with a closing of 206 yuan, resulting in a small loss of 1 yuan. However, Hong Kong's crude oil was sluggish in actual sales, opening at 170 yuan in the morning, to 80 yuan, and 180 yuan in the afternoon, with a closing of 76 yuan, a drop of 9 yuan. Hechi was stable, with 165 yuan to 68 yuan in the morning, and 172 yuan to 70 yuan in the afternoon, with no change. Taiche White HX mark was 179 yuan.</p>
<h3>Huainan Coal Drops in a Straight Line</h3>
<p>Initially, Huainan bituminous coal's source was blocked, and there was a shortage of spot goods in the market. Block coal had been as high as 800 yuan. Recently, the Japanese military notes have fallen back, and the cost of water feet has been reduced. A certain party has also opened a large number of goods. The dark disc cannot support a straight line drop. Yesterday's disc calculation was that Huainan selected blocks were 670 yuan per ton, and general coal was 600 yuan, which was 150 yuan less than the highest price at the beginning of last month.</p>

<h3>Price Limits and Price Increases</h3>
<p>— Mu Chang</p>
<p>Since the authorities of the two concession areas began managing prices, the agitated hearts of the citizens have been somewhat calmed. Although there is still a considerable gap from actual living expenses, the trend of soaring prices has been curbed to a certain extent. This is something for which we must be grateful for the wise measures of the authorities.</p>
<p>In recent days, they have been even more resolute, and the authorities have expressed their determination to protect the people. After careful investigation, price limits for hundreds of items have been announced one after another. Who would not believe this is a benevolent policy? It has received fervent support from the masses, and nothing could be better. The other day, the French Concession authorities, based on the price control regulations, revoked the business licenses of several tobacco and paper shops and closed several grocery stores and pharmacies. The public notice posted on the doors of these shops read: "Closed by order of the Bureau of General Affairs for selling goods above the price limit." Everyone could not help but feel refreshed and extremely gratified.</p>
<p>However, just as everyone was feeling joyful, the Shanghai Electric Tramways Company in the International Settlement issued a request to increase fares by 50% to 60% starting next month, claiming "a sharp increase in expenses." The Public Works Department, considering the matter insignificant, "decided to temporarily ignore it." This wise measure is also worthy of everyone's support, and we hope it is not "temporary" but "official." This is by no means our "unreasonable demand." The sharp increase in expenses must be proven with facts. When others are decreasing prices, you alone want to increase them—this is wishful thinking. We recall that the Stabilization Fund has already approved foreign exchange settlements for coal and kerosene. Haven't we all benefited from this to some extent? How does the company intend to justify this? (In addition, the Shanghai Power Company is also revising its surcharges.)</p>
<p>Similarly, the French Water and Electricity Company, while everyone was feeling joyful, officially "changed" the prices of water and electricity. In total, electricity, tap water, and trams are all implementing price increases. This cannot help but make the public "anxious." It concerns the vital interests of every citizen, yet the authorities have overlooked it. The reason for this is truly unclear.</p>
<p>The French Concession's reduction of electricity fees is still fresh in our minds, but now they have suddenly changed course, which is quite contradictory. Or is this a "surprise attack" to silence criticism, so as to avoid demands for the same price limits as other goods?</p>
<p>The principle of the world is nothing more than human sentiment. If human sentiment is not considered "worthy of cherishing," then we earnestly demand a reduction in water and electricity prices.</p>
<h3>Strict Implementation of Price Controls Begins as Tram Company Requests Fare Increase</h3>
<p>— Wenzai</p>
<p>All Shanghai Citizens Hope for Improvements in "Transportation"</p>
<p>Since Shanghai became an "isolated island," some unscrupulous merchants have unscrupulously hoarded and speculated, making a fortune from the national crisis. The authorities of the two concessions, deeply aware of the detrimental impact of this deplorable situation on social order, took swift action on the tenth of this month, implementing price controls within their concession areas. The first priority was the staple food of the citizens, rice. Since the implementation, although only two weeks have passed, the prices of various commodities have already seen a widespread decline, and public sentiment has also stabilized somewhat. This demonstrates that the authorities of the two concessions are concerned about the people's suffering and are helping all Shanghai citizens to ascend to comfort.</p>
<p>Regarding the control of food for the people, the authorities' efforts have achieved significant results and are currently expanding and rectifying retail goods. Although some unscrupulous merchants, driven by greed, continue to feign compliance while secretly hiding goods or refusing to sell at the controlled prices, the authorities, to deter such behavior, have taken resolute action, confiscating goods and revoking business licenses. This should make those unscrupulous merchants feel cold and suppress the trend of speculation and hoarding, so that all prices can return to normal.</p>
<p>The implementation of price controls cannot be accomplished hastily, so the authorities believe that this measure must be implemented gradually and with detailed investigation. Otherwise, the result will be more harm than good, and it may even trigger unnecessary price increases. The two authorities are making their utmost efforts to expand their price control mechanisms and implement them as soon as possible. It is hoped that the public will show patience and cooperation towards the authorities, and eliminate all anxiety and unreasonable price increases.</p>
<p>At a time when the authorities are strictly enforcing price controls, it is surprising that the newspapers of the 24th published that the Shanghai Electric Tramways Company in the International Settlement has requested the Public Works Department to approve a 50% to 61% increase in fares starting from December 1st. It is perplexing what the company intends to achieve by requesting a fare increase at a time when the authorities are suppressing prices. Is it trying to preemptively counter potential demands from citizens for fare reductions?</p>
<p>Tram and bus companies are public utilities, not comparable to other commercial stores. However, the company's fares are already five or six times higher than before August 13th. The reasons given for each fare increase are "continuous shrinking of exchange rates, unsustainable fuel sources, sharp increases in the prices of all commodities, and issuance of subsidies to employees, leading to a sharp increase in expenses and a reduction in the company's net profit." However, the exchange rate is now stable, the source of coal is continuous, the inventory is sufficient, and cheap fuel can be purchased. Passengers are still crowding, and revenue has not decreased. When the prices of various commodities are decreasing, the company suddenly requests a fare increase, which is quite baffling. Citizens rely on "transportation" for work-related time constraints, and the problem has "not yet been solved." If they do not take vehicles and walk on foot, a pair of shoes and socks will cost at least ten yuan or so. If they take vehicles, the daily round-trip fare is already unbearable. If the road is far and busy, the fare accounts for one-tenth or two-tenths of the monthly salary. Fortunately, the concession authorities, considering that the company increased fares by as much as 50% in September of this year and are actively suppressing the prices of all other commodities, have decided to ignore the company's request to increase fares at this time. This demonstrates that the concession authorities, at this time of crisis, are showing concern for the people's hardship and understanding the greater good. If they further plan to improve the "transportation" problem for citizens, all Shanghai citizens will undoubtedly have even more ardent expectations.</p>
<h3>Six Jiao for a Single Urination</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor:</p>
<p>Please forgive my lack of formalities. At 4:30 PM on the 17th of this month, while passing by the XXX Grand Theater on Avenue Joffre, I felt a strong urge to urinate, so I entered the theater intending to "relieve" myself. However, the ticket collector insisted that I purchase a ticket at the ticket office before I could urinate (but the theater's urinal was not located inside the auditorium). Despite repeatedly explaining my situation, they refused to allow me. At that moment, I was in such dire need to urinate that I was on the verge of making a scene. Helplessly, I paid six jiao at the ticket office to purchase a ticket, entered the urinal, and immediately discarded the ticket (because I had important matters to attend to, I gave up my right to watch the movie, I hereby declare). I understand that the cost of living is high, but six jiao for a single urination is unheard of. I earnestly request to borrow a corner of your esteemed publication to promote benevolence. Respectfully submitted, Tang Chaoying</p>
<p>Editor's note: The XXX Grand Theater does not seem to be specifically for passersby to urinate. This may be a privilege for the audience. However, "facilitating" others is also "facilitating" oneself. Taking advantage of someone's emergency is like setting up a checkpoint and forcibly extracting money, which is not appropriate. As for the writer giving up his right to watch the movie, this is nothing more than "buying the casket and returning the pearl." Overall, although the matter arose in an emergency, it should have been handled more openly, so as to avoid others profiting from it.</p>

<h3>The Ethics of Reading Newspapers in the Library</h3>
<p>— Xiao Su</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, I went to the library to read newspapers and discovered a very unpleasant matter, that is, the ethics of reading newspapers.</p>
<p>At a long table, there were more than ten people sitting. Apart from three or four reading magazines, there were two reading Shen Bao (one copy each), one reading Zheng Yan Bao, one reading Shen Zhou Daily, two reading Zhongmei Daily (one copy each), two reading Xinwen Bao (one copy each), and five or six people idly sitting among the newspaper readers. This was a group of candidates, and I was one of them.</p>
<p>Originally, newspapers with many pages, such as Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao, could be laid flat on the table for two people to read together. However, except for a student-like person with Zheng Yan Bao who completely spread out the newspaper and shared it with the person sitting next to him, the rest, as if they had been trained, uniformly folded the four or five pages of the newspaper together along the newspaper holder and read them alone. Sometimes we—a group of candidates—peered forward, and they would either deliberately obstruct our vision with their heads and hands or quickly turn the page to change to another one. They seemed to think that the newspaper was theirs and that we had no right to read it.</p>
<p>Here, I must solemnly declare that I am not demanding that newspaper readers read ten lines at a glance and finish quickly, but I think re-reading is unnecessary. Moreover, deliberately obstructing others' vision, thinking that it is more comfortable to read alone, or believing that because I got the newspaper first, others have no right to read it together, is the worst habit.</p>

<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Fifteen "Dad, let's go begging!"</p>
<p>"Well, —… Meibao,… quickly… pull… pull that chair over… quickly pour tea…!" Usually, Begonia has experienced enough of the power of this top boss, and gradually developed a kind of fear. Today, although his expression is particularly gentle and his words are particularly kind, Begonia's heart feels as afraid as if she had seen an evil god, so she hurriedly urged Meishi to sit and pour tea.</p>
<p>Meishi did not know the inside story, and remained calm throughout. While walking to pour tea, she also said: "Mr. Zhang, this place is too small, please sit on that square stool!"</p>
<p>Zhang Yincai saw her so lively and clever, and was not angry at all. Instead, he grinned widely and said to Begonia with a smile:</p>
<p>"Old Wu, is this your daughter? You are truly blessed!"</p>
<p>Begonia couldn't help but force a bitter smile at him.</p>
<p>"Last night, I told Mr. Zhou in the backstage about your fall, and he agreed to give you half a month's leave." Zhang Yincai said as he took out a fat and large wallet from his pocket, which was proportional to his own body. "I saw that you were spitting a lot of blood, so I hurried to send you this pack of medicine. Swallow it quickly! Every time we beat someone up, those who bled will take this medicine, and it will stop the bleeding immediately!" (274)</p>

<h3>I Secretly Tell You Some Secrets of Movie Filming (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Former Benck</p>
<p>The things on the screen are all ambiguous. For example, snow scenes are made with puffed rice. Therefore, the largest amount of food transported from outside to Hollywood is puffed rice. It is rare for it to snow in Hollywood. If you want to shoot on these days, the color is too dark to shoot good shots. It is better to use a huge electric fan to blow puffed rice around, which is more similar. So the next time you see a snow scene on the screen, you undoubtedly don't know how many tons of puffed rice are being spent.</p>
<p>Clothes and furniture cloth are stained with ink, and the loss cannot be compensated by washing once. When this scene is needed on the screen, a kind of juice called "Wasdacia" is used instead of ink. This juice has the effect of ink and is easy to wash off. When actors fall into plaster on the screen, they use a kind of powder mixed with water instead of it. The same is true for paint. Honey is used as paint.</p>
<p>Even bread has a special function. Here, I want to remind you that when an actor is injured by a brick or a stick on the screen, you don't need to pity him. Originally, bricks, sticks, and the like are all made of bread. There is a kind of machine in Hollywood filming sets that specializes in making brick-shaped and stick-shaped bread. Hitting it on the body does not feel pain or itching.</p>
<p>The flying porcelain tiles and thrown glass on the screen are all tricks. It's not that Hollywood producers can't bear the money, but because it reflects too much light. So, they use sugar candy to replace it. They create cups, basins, bowls, and dishes that are lifelike. Even the glass to be broken is made of large pieces of sugar candy.</p>
<p>No matter when or where, it is always unpleasant for soap bubbles to get into your eyes or mouth. Of course, there are many scenes in movies that require actors to get soap bubbles in their eyes or mouth. Wouldn't that be miserable for them? But wait, don't feel sorry for them. Art doesn't require such sacrifices. They also have a substitute to replace soap bubbles! That's milk essence, which looks exactly like soap bubbles when filmed. So when you think the actor has soap bubbles in his mouth, he is actually eating milk essence. The white foam that tired horses spit out is also made of milk essence.</p>
<h3>Huang Guiqiu's The Golden Lock</h3>
<p>— Linlin</p>
<p>The complete The Golden Lock, written by Yu Shuang herself, is her famous work. The play is rich in emotion, the acting and singing are excellent, and the tunes are novel and do not fall into the trap of others, which is her specialty. Wan Hua's performance of this play has no previous scene, starting from sitting in prison to the execution ground, so it is not called The Golden Lock, but June Snow. Wan Hua wins with her voice, and Yu Shuang is known for her new tunes. This has been renewed and renamed Huang Guiqiu. The old actor Chen Delin is an expert in this play and is famous in his time, such as the new tune of "Shisi Hen" in the Erhuang Manban during the prison scene, which is pleasant to the ear. According to The Golden Lock, starting from Cai Changzong going to the examination to the execution ground, going to the yamen, the Erhuang Yaoban, "Saying goodbye to the neighbors, going out and going, hurrying to get on the road and rushing to the yamen." This repetition singing method is especially unique and innovative. There are new tunes in each sentence of the Erhuang Manban in the prison scene. The Fan Erhuang in the execution ground is the essence of the whole play. The singing and tunes are unique, different from Wan Hua and Yan Qiu, and each word is a tear, which is heartbreaking. Jiang Shiyu's Cai Changzong is still qualified, and Xiao Shoushan's Mama Jin is no less than Lan Sanxing. It is appropriate that Guiqiu's The Golden Lock can also be as valued as Yan Qiu's.

<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 19 The Evening Brings Dust and Huns to the City</p>
<p>Liu Yining opened up his pear blossom ancient fixed gun, his whole body was covered in white light, like a piece of pear blossoms, fluttering in the wind, deflecting the arrowheads, and directly killed Li Yan, trying to capture Li Yan alive. Li Yan saw that the general was so brave, he was so frightened that he turned his horse and fled, not daring to meet the challenge. Liu Yining chased after him, and with a swoosh, an arrow shot towards his horse's head. This was Li Yan's back shot from the horse. Li Yan was always good at archery and had the nickname Sai Huarong in the Chuang army. At this moment, he was chased by Liu Yining, so he wanted to shoot people with hidden arrows. Unexpectedly, Liu Yining was quick-eyed and quick-handed. When the arrow reached the horse's head, he gently plucked the gun, and the arrow fell to the ground with a thud. But Li Yan had a trick of continuous bead arrows. If one arrow didn't hit, the second arrow came again. Liu Yining scooped with his left hand and grabbed it in his hand. Then the third arrow flew to Liu Yining's face like a meteor. Liu Yining opened his mouth and bit, and bit the arrowhead. Spit it out on the ground. Logically, the continuous bead arrow always fired three arrows. As long as you let go of the three arrows, you will be fine. So Liu Yining had avoided the three arrows, and he felt a little relaxed. Unexpectedly, Li Yan's continuous bead arrow fired five arrows regardless. The fourth arrow shot towards his lower three roads. Liu Yining lifted the horse and dodged to the left quickly. After all, it was at night and he couldn't see very clearly. An arrow hit his right leg, and he knew that he had been hit by a rogue's arrow. So he also reached out and took out a ringing dart from his waist pocket, aimed it at Li Yan's mount in front, and threw it away. With a clang, the dart hit Li Yan's horse's ass. The horse jumped up and threw Li Yan off the saddle. The rogue stepped forward to rescue him. (230)</p>
