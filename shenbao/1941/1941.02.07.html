<p>社評</p>
<h3>美總統代表寇利氏到渝</h3>
<p>昨晚所傳香港消息，美國總統羅斯福氏所遣來華代表寇利氏，前日從馬尼拉到香港，昨日從香港赴重慶。至記者握管時爲止。尙無續報，但預計行程，應已安然抵渝。寇利氏是美國總統府的事務副主任（？），是研究經濟現實問題的統計專家；這一决到中國，據說其主要任務：一，賚總統私函，面致中國蔣委員長；二二調查中國經濟實情。或說，美國是吾將鉅數借款畀予中國，將以寇利氏的調查報告爲決定的參考；但是這一傳說，已由中美當局所明白吾認了。</p>
<p>我們歡迎寇利氏到中國，到重慶。我們很慚愧，未能對寇利氏有何切實的數字的貢獻；惟重慶當局已有表示，待寇利到渝之後，凡彼需要調查，需要知道的一切，必開誠布公，必給以最大便利；然則寇氏此行使命的對象，可信其必取給有自，而無待我們從旁申述。而我們所願申述者，亦即在切實數字之外。</p>
<p>我們不以爲所聞寇利氏到華的任務，便是他眞實使命的全部；抑我們亦不欲深究寇氏眞實使命的究竟如何，而但願寇氏加以注意者：其一，美國對遠東，對中國，所持鮮明而堅決的政策，既爲我們所熟知；我們却願向美國朝野補充說明者，在美國政策之下，決定推行其一切措置的時候，至少在目前，務須襬脫其習慣的商業態度，變通其例行的商業方式；我們承認所謂「商業的」實是最切實，最確鑿，且最悠久的標準，既適合於美國的正常軌範與理想，且爲崇尙信義的中國所不辭研討。然現在之所謂非常時期，初不但中國遭遇了侵略，纔成其爲非常，即就整個國際而論，就世界前途而論，現在正是人類空前的非常時期：惟其非常，美國應從大處遠處着眼而取爲決定一切的標準，窮則變，變則通，殊未宜囿於習慣的與正常的軌範與理想。其二，今日的中國，在開始抗戰，經過了四十三個月之後的階段；重要都市被陷了甚多，膏腴之地被佔了甚廣，沿海沿江多被封鎖，工業商業多被蹂躪；在這時期之中，在這情况之下，萬萬不堪皮相；惟有能自知，具自信的中國人，以及眞知灼見，高瞻遠矚的專家，纔能理解中國所蘊藏的潛力，如何雄厚，必可爲繼續長期抗戰的憑藉，因此之故，希望寇利氏調查所注意者，須自現在倒溯既往，更須自現在預測將來，庶幾可以曉然於這擁有五千年歷史的泱泱大國，究竟是怎樣宏偉豐厚的一個文明集團，一個生活集團。其三，中國的政治經濟社會以及種種，揆之現代的標準，誠有種種不如；故若一切以西洋的，科學的水準來衡量，每每難知中國實况。我們不知將如何始可幫助寇利氏來洞悉中國的一切，但不妨指陳一種籠統的輪廓，取爲理解中國的一助；質言之，中國自社會與事業暨軍隊以及政治，充滿了骨肉同胞的先天因素，不妨假定稱述這是一個親族型的家族型的國族。但看平時的失業問題，以及戰時的難民問題，實際上無論如何艱難困苦，却逈乎不同於歐美人士及歐美國家所想像的那樣嚴重。即此一端，應可推演考量之於其他種種問題。蓋必以數字爲準，以統計爲準，則不但將有種種失望，且將有種種不必耍的悲觀與失望。其四，中美兩國國交在歷史上的過程，我們不必贅言；至於現在：中國是交戰國之一，美國是中立國之一，立塲似乎完全兩岐：但從民治的服赝，太平洋前途的安危利害，人類文明與國際條的的信念，以及反侵略的意願，則中美完全站在同一陣營，完全趨嚮同一歸宿，這是羅斯福總統，赫爾國務卿與寇利氏以及美國朝野一般明達之士之所熟知，亦不待贅言；所猶願一言者，中國以抗戰與建國，即現在與現在以後，視爲中國國族茲所從事努力者的兩面，絕非不同的兩事：美國茲所求知於有關中國者，務將中國的抗戰與建國，現在與現在以後，亦即援助作戰與開發資源及市塲，視同一事，統盤打算；庶幾可以獲得更偉大更準確的觀念。</p>
<p>右舉四端，殷願爲寇利氏所夙加注意，而記者所述乃爲多餘的廢話。</p>

<h3>費利浦招待記者　談市政措施見解　稅收問題歡迎各方讜論　警權協定在謀居民福利</h3>
<p>昨（六）日下午三時工部居總辦兼總裁費利表市政溥氏、在該局招待中外新聞記者、發表市政措施之意見、其詞略謂今日辱承諸君　邀、惠臨本局、鄙人非常欣幸、資就若干項爲公衆所注目之市政措施、略抒意見如下、</p>
<p>研究稅收　委員人選</p>
<p>關於征稅之公允問題、近已發表頗多、本局並經組織一委員會、硏究此項問題、委員人選、爲樊克令·鍾思·梅翰·岡本·及孫瑞璜君等五人、若干人士、或將提起責問、謂該委員會之委員三人、與本局均有過密之關係、此種抨擊、事所或有、故敝人願乘此機會解釋所以組織該委員會、而遴選熟悉本局事務之專家担任委員、查該委員之任務、頗非易易、而其工作、必須加緊、俾其報告書得及時提付本年四月間舉行之納稅外僑大會也、職是之故、本局認爲担任此工作者、必須充分明瞭本局現行制度及征捐之原則與慣例、且能立即開始工作、方克有濟、鍾思君曾任本局總辦、熟諳英國捐稅法律、（按本局征捐制度、係根據上項法律所厘訂者、）樊克令與罔本兩君、不特熟悉本局情形、抑且富有各國習慣之法律常識、梅翰君對於本問題、已硏究有素、意見頗多、孫瑞璜君爲新華銀行副經理、經騐豐富、</p>
<p>各方意見　虛衷採納</p>
<p>諸君請勿以爲此委員會成立以後、市民個人即無發揮意見之機會、各團體願向該委員會發表宏論者、無不歡迎、而納稅人欲個別對於稅制有所表示者、亦在歡迎之列、諸君並請勿認爲本局希望該委員會將僅贊同現行制度、本局深知現行稅制、有欠公允之處、屢欲設法補救、該委員會倘能計劃掃除不平之因、而將稅制置於較爲公允之基礎上者、寗非快事、</p>
<p>征收權限　重行考慮</p>
<p>敝人茲欲對於若干其他各項、有所陳述、一部份人士、有以爲本局應行實施全部新稅制者、敝人對於此項意見、雖不欲使人以爲本人有所反對、但希望諸君對共若干窒礙之點、加以考慮、多年以來、本局律師所舉告本局者、爲本局征稅權力、限於碼頭捐·執照費·地稅及房捐各項、本局已準備請共重行考慮、可吾擴充本局征稅權限、但應請注意者、即任何稅費、倘不能在法院實施者、不能有效、故諸君所付捐稅、應爲公共租界法院認爲法定的義務、此即本局所以不能超越地皮竟程之規定也、</p>
<p>新稅制度　窒礙難行</p>
<p>茲據此法律上之困難點而不論、請試就捉議之新稅制之方式、加以檢討、目下認爲本局應向營業利益上征收捐稅者、恐不乏其人、但此事在上海困難滋多、且苟非各個人根據同一標準、繳納捐稅、則此種稅制、有欠公允、試思計算國籍不同之各個市民與營業上之眞正收入與利益、其困難究將若何、倘欲實行、則木局必須雇用大批調查員、稽核員與會計員、而調查所得、未必可靠、　論本局並無此種權限、得以關查商號簿冊也、</p>
<p>交易所稅　難以持久</p>
<p>或有以爲本局可向證劵交易所或其他交易所征稅者、關於此層、敝人不欲使人有所誤會、木局認爲倘能由於自動捐助或强迫征取之方法中、向證券交易所或同樣營業取得任何相當收入者、亦屬欣慰、但本局經常支出、竟恃此項稅收以應付者、果計之所得乎、倘證券交易所營業旺盛之時、則向之征稅、可望獲得相當收入、但其營業入於衰落、則稅收毫無、余故主張此類捐稅苟能征取者、當用於非常及額外開支、</p>
<p>訂立靜權協定　旨在維持秩序</p>
<p>最後、關於最近成立之滬西警務協定、此項協定、係歷數月經營之結果、深信可以解答外界對於本局之評論、有欲本局對於西區之弊賓、採取所謂直接行動者、但本局如果在轄權尙在爭執中之區域內、實施直接行動、則成立協定以圖恢復西區秩序之希望、恐將不克實施、敝人對於一般屬於完全不同性質之評論、亦曾予以注意、有人以本局與渠等所稱「實際上」之官史、進行談判加以指摘者、竄則本局對於任何方式之政治、並不關涉、本局所欲爲者、在乎爲上海數百　華人及萬千外僑維護常態耳、無論何人苟能相助本局以達成此項目的者、本局準備與之接觸、　有人批評本局在西區要求過多者、余之解答爲本局唯一目的、在盡力爲一般住居界外馬路者履行義務、俾渠等能享受本局服務之利益也、</p>
<h3>工部局向領團建義　選舉董事日期　並將定期開納稅人年會　局董人數當可繼續保持</h3>
<p>公共租界納稅外人特會中一塲口舌大戰之尾聲、猶未絕耳、而有關公共租界事務的另一塲重要爭鬥之初步行、動已於昨日（六日）展開、蓋工部局已將該局董事年選之日期、提交上海領事團核准、而於四月十六日舉行納稅人年滙事、亦在考量中也、</p>
<p>選舉局董　提出日期</p>
<p>聞諸負責方面、工部局已建議四月二日與三日爲選舉下屆管理公共租界事務的董事九人之適當日期、此項請求、可望於數日內得領事團核准、工部局接獲領事團對此間題之答覆、料將提出關於納稅人年會之要求、目局方刻正研究四月十穴日爲此會之最佳日期、</p>
<p>美僑聯會　今日集會</p>
<p>至於納稅日人於去歲選舉時提議之修改選舉辦法、迄無詳情可得、衆覺除非在工部局下次會期前採納若干新辦法、則選舉之重要結果、將無變更、據昨日消息、本市美僑聯合會執行委員會、將於今日（七日）集會、衆信該聯合會將推舉工部局美董預備候選人、向例手續、須有充分時間、以便美僑舉薦其他候選人、然後決定最後舉薦之美董候選人、</p>
<p>人數比率　仍可保持聞納稅日人會尙未決定　舉日董候選人之日期、但料該會不久將有此舉、日人方面對於其將舉薦日董候選人若干、今日未有表示、但一般預料候選日董　至少將有五人、如去歲然、依據目下公共租界納稅人之票數觀之、工部局西董七人、與日董兩人之選舉現狀、當可繼續保持、因目下之票數、西人較日人多三倍有奇也、衆料納稅日人不久將續有行動、以期更變公共租界現行選舉制度與納稅人年會之手續、</p>
<h3>加捐案通過後　各方所呈反應　華人處境困難暫忍痛苦　日方表示將照新章納稅　工部局設委員會研究稅收制度</h3>
<p>公共租界工部局召開外僑納稅人特別大會、討論增加捐稅案、引起歷來未有之嚴重紛爭、現加捐案終於在再度召集之大會中得獲通過、但佔公共租界納稅人最多數納稅額最高之華人、對於加捐案根本不能置喙、此一不公平之事實、深印在每個中國人心頭、一般華人之見解、咸以國家在此爭取整個復興之時、一切抱犧牲小我態度、是以對納稅特會通過加捐、均異常沈默、忍受暫時之痛苦、以待光明之復臨、</p>
<p>設委員會　研究稅制</p>
<p>工部局依據總董在納稅人特別大會席上之宜盲、組織一委員會、硏究現行稅制、對於自用業產與出租業產之不公允之點、並設法有以補救之、委員人選計爲孫瑞璜·樊克令·鍾思·梅翰及岡本五人、秘書爲格雷、各公團曁納稅人、倘有意見向該委員會發表者、無不歡迎、函件請寄工部局總辦處格雷君、</p>
<p>居民負担　更將加重</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、昨日（武日）公共租界納稅外人特會通過工部局加徵捐稅與執照費什四之決議案後、今日（六日）公共租界小納稅人表不滿者、不乏其人、此外今晨一般人對加捐之反響尙佳、殊少續加責難者、且認此爲莫可避免之步驟、因工部局亟需更多之經費也、許多納稅人以爲昨日特會通過加捐、恐將促成房租之續增、則公共租界居民肩頭之負担、更將加重矣、</p>
<p>日僑按照　新章納稅</p>
<p>日納稅人對於加捐案自始反對、日前盛傳如加捐案爲納稅人特會通過、則日人擬在租界北區設一分區、脫離工部局獨立、但此說巳由日方吾認、聲稱此係無稽之談、一般咸以日納稅人是吾將照新稅率納稅爲念、唯據日方宣稱、日納稅人仍將遵奉前日納稅外人特會之決議、而照新章納稅、然究竟如何、則有待於事實之證明、</p>
<h3>工部局　副總董　將由米契爾繼任</h3>
<p>工部局現任副總董卡奈、離滬在即、該局董事會現經另推米契爾繼仟斯職、各董事對於卡氏之勞績、推崇備至、</p>
<h3>改善米市　工部局提意見　防止囤積居奇投機操縱　越米運日謠言證明無稽</h3>
<p>工部局爲防止糧食之囤積居奇與投機起見、業經准如糧食委員會之建議、向米市塲管理委員會提出下列各項辦法、促其實施、</p>
<p>七項辦法</p>
<p>（一）各批發米商、應爲米市塲之當然會員、（二）可靠之米掮客、應予登記、並飭其覓具妥保、此項担保、必須經米業公會認爲滿意者、（三）各米商應將售出之米糧、戴明簿冊或發票、每决成交時、應具備成單三份、一份交與買主、一份送交市塲管理人、另一份由賣主留存、此項成單、必須註明價格數量品質、以及貿賣兩方之姓名及住址、所有籌冊發票成單、得田工部局隨時派員檢查、（四）所有本埠批發交易、應予集中米市塲一處、現行每决購貨至少十包之辦法、仍應維持、成交後每包先付定洋五元、並應于五天內出貨、吾則定洋沒收、（五）每日公布售米價格之辦法、應切實執行、（六）關于期貨購買、到貨售米以及存底與存底所在地各項、應有最新之統計、（七）未到埠之米糧交易、應僅限于可靠之批發米商、</p>
<p>平糶續辦</p>
<p>上海平糶委員會、自開始舉辦西貢碎米平糶以來、嘉惠平民匪淺、對於本市整個民食問題、頗多裨益、第八期平糶、已於一月十九日結束、平明社記者昨向該會訪悉、該會決秉承當局意旨、繼續舉辦第九期碎米平糶、本埠近日洋米湧到、存底益見豐厚、米價可望跌、但平民仍無力出資購買、故對於續辦第九期平糶米問題、現正着手進行籌備、俟日內召開會議商討具體辦法後、再行決定舉辦日期、</p>
<p>越米未漲</p>
<p>米市塲謠言現已證實無稽、本市米業界昨已接獲西貢同業來電報告、以越南黨局前曾一度徇日方要求、八萬噸貢米轉日本接濟、茲已取銷此糶、因此間向越富局提出交涉、又某米行亦接香港同業電告、彼地米價不受時局影響、穏定如恒、本市米商獲得是項佳音後、似已心寬意泰、持貨者恐遭意外損失、已照新訂限價次第出籠、現貨籌碼驟增、昨晨米業市况頓見好轉、人心趨疲、顧本市米價竟以謠傳爲依歸、誠屬非是、蓋本市民食存底不可謂少、總數在一百餘萬包以上、同時洋米來源仍絡繹於途、國米運滬一節、亦甫由兩租界當局積極設法疏通中、然投機者仍隨時乘機蠢動、誠不勝痛心、</p>
<h3>美哉華當局表示　不撤退滬防軍　謠言攻勢來自德日方面　圖阻援助民治國案通過</h3>
<p>據行將於明日出版之密勒氏評論報戰稱、上週週末此間盛傳遠東美僑、不久即將全部撤退、然質之美國負責當局、咸稱此項報告、全爲無稽之談、以美國在華當局於若干時期前、曾下令勸告無必要在遠東之美僑撤退、然並無令美麥令斯隊撤退之時、同時、亦未限令美僑在三十日內自中國全部撤退、且經記者向各方面調查結果、發見此項謠言、係由日人及納粹方面於星期三四兩日所傳出、其目的在使美國輿情反對援助民治國法案之通過、此種論言攻勢、不專行之於上海一、地、其所以特別注意上海者、爲藉上海作爲一傳達地點</p>
<h3>美總統輸　絡繹來滬　孟羅總統起椗南下　克利扶倫明晚抵埠</h3>
<p>美國總統輪船公司世界班郵船孟羅總統號、昨午首决到滬、該郵船準照預定船期、於今晨五時啟徒、赴香港小呂宋、經南洋各埠回返紐約、</p>
<p>孟羅總統</p>
<p>乘該輪來滬之旅客寥寥、聞乘該輸赴南洋者亦不多、祇三十六人、惟均係頭等、下次來滬世界班、</p>
<p>傑克遜號</p>
<p>仍爲上次來滬之傑克遜總統號新輪、於本月三日回至波士頓後、旋於四日自波士頓作第二次環航、的今日由紐約開出、的下月十九日到滬、</p>
<p>海士總統</p>
<p>第三艘新輪海士總統號、亦已下水、現正髹漆裝修中、將於下月四日由波士頓作處女航東來、的四月十六日可到滬、</p>
<p>克利扶輸</p>
<p>克利扶輸總統號、此次由小呂宋回程、經香港來滬、據該公司宣稱、定明日八日）下午十時抵埠、亦泊十二十三號浮筒、乘客改趁公司預備之小輪、的明晚十一時半至新關碼頭登陸、該輪在滬停留一畫夜、定九日晚九時四十五分離滬、赴神戶橫濱、經檀香山舊金山返歸洛杉磯、接客小輪末决明晚八時十五分、自新關碼頭開往、</p>
<h3>對開槍·縱火事件　日報嚴詞斥責　認爲將受人不齒輕視　林雄吉等行動決難贊許</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今（六日）晨本市日文「上海每日新聞」社評、對於旅滬日僑所取不法手段、如林雄吉槍傷凱自威與兩日人之希圖焚毀納稅人特會會塲上蘆蓆棚、加以銳利之斥責、略謂、森永松之助與久保盛明圖焚蘆蓆棚、在主觀上「固堪同情」、但在客觀上究屬不法行爲、公共租界之將來發展、不無「刺激吾人神經與正義情緒」之可能、但日人皆應愼弗出以招人不齒與輕視之任何行動、往日曾有日人出以動機謬誤之行爲、致使日政府陷於窘境者、非止一决、日人對於此等日人之行動、容或瞭解、但外人在許多方面與日人不同、固不能盼其亦具同樣反響也、該報末稱、「吾人不復是羣島上日人、而係在東亞或世界上之日人、此點不可忘懷、吾人對於因槍傷凱自威現兼受問之林雄吉與圖焚蘆蓆棚之兩人、確有同情之感、但決不能贊許彼等之行動、</p>
<h3>一特法院　精衛嚴密　七浦路缺口仍堵塞</h3>
<p>七浦路缺口仍堵塞公共租界工部局爲保護第一特區法院及江蘇高等法院第二分院、於前日傍晚、將北浙江路甘肅路間之七浦路加以封鎖、當時本在甘肅路留有一缺口、昨起該缺口即未開啟、蓋該路業已毫無住戶、同時美國駐軍亦在法院內日夜駐守、鐵絲網之兩端、則由中印捕站崗、法庭開容時，則由法警在庭警衛、庭外由巡捕駐軍保護、威海衛路分辦事處、亦同樣警戒、故警備情形益臻嚴密、</p>
<h3>希僑昨追悼　希故首相</h3>
<p>旅滬希臘僑民與希臘友人、昨日（六日）午後五時三十分、赴亨利路五十五號正宗敎堂參加的翰主敎主持之慰靈祭、以追悼希臘故首相米達塞斯、全世界希臘人、皆定昨日舉行追悼故首相之儀式、按米達塞斯係一週前患喉病施刀圭後現生、</p>

<h3>大房東串通三房客　控二房束遷讓　法院訊明判決大房東敗訴</h3>
<p>蛋商戴慧琴、在「八一三」以前、因合興地產公司在天潼路建築六一二弄住宅及市房多幢、乃出三千六百元小費、訂租市房三幢（即天潼路六二四號·六二六號·六二八號）擬開設興泰蛋行、幷訂租弄內住宅一所、門牌九號、迨</p>
<p>滬戰發生該處房屋尚未完工、至民國二十七年二月一日始完工、當時戴因市面不景氣、自己使用六二八號市房開蛋行、至六二四號及六二六號兩間、則分租黃克成開設標準煤球公司、均係於房屋落成時開幕、戴與大房東所訂租約係不定期、與三房客所訂租約則係</p>
<p>定期租賃</p>
<p>最初各造均無異言、嗣因滬地屋少人多、房租飛漲、合興地產公司曾以空白租約數紙交戴、要求改為定期祖賃、被戴拒絕、而黃克成向戴分租之房屋、租約屆滿、戴欲收回自用、擴張蛋行店面、黃不同意、涉訟結果、黃敗訴、旋由合興公司出面訴請</p>
<p>判令遷讓、其理由謂、雙方所訂租約係定期且已屆滿、結果承審推事訊明合興公司所提租約係屬變造、判決合興公司敗訴、合興公司嗣又以戴將房屋全部出租、違背租約之理由、另向第一特院民庭、訴請判令戴謙讓、初審因有三房客等到案作證、判戴敗訴、</p>
<p>戴不服判因大房東與三房客串通、矇蔽法院、故近延嚴蔭武律師上訴高二法院、請求廢棄第一審之判決、該案經高二分院審理結果、認為戴上訴不無理由、已於日昨宣判合興地產公司敗訴、</p>
<h3>舞女林小妹懷孕　控訴舞客姦淫　被吿並不否認發生關係但論時間地點殊有疑問</h3>
<p>住居法租界望志路望德里六號門牌之大都會舞廳舞女林小妹（十八歲·紹興人·又名如友）偕同其母林金氏投老閘捕勇控訴住於貴州路新新放館五百另三號房間前東吳大學學生台州人俞仲雲（年二十四歲）姦淫、據指與俞在一年前在舞廳結識、至九月間、即先後經俞誘至新新旅館五百另三號·五百另九號·五百十八號房間。</p>
<p>連續姦汚六七次、處女貞操亦被俞所破、當時俞謂願娶我為室、但現懷孕約二月、俞即將我遺棄云云、經華探目薜有文調查屬實、乃將俞拘捕、昨晨解送特一法院刑一庭、捕房律師錢恂九依刑法二百四十條第三項妨害家庭罪起訴、而林小妹投陳前情、表示不願訴究、詰之俞仲雲供、與林小妹</p>
<p>發生關係確係事實、但日期則在去年二月間、最後一次亦在去年六月間、故其二個月之身孕、若謂我所有、殊屬疑問、因其能與我發生關係、難保不與他人有同樣事實、至林小妹稱、貞操為我所破一點、亦非事實、因現在香港之我友王某、早我與林有肉體關係也、且我在原籍已娶有妻室、更育有子女、何能再納林女為妻、而發生關係之地點、</p>
<p>並非新新旅館、乃在百樂門飯店與滄州飯店、末由捕房錢律師論吿謂、本件捕房所訴條文非吿訴乃論、故原吿雖不願追究、依法不能撤回、應請依法處斷、馮世德庭長核供、乃宣吿辯論終結、改期一星期宣判、被吿還押、</p>

<h3>糧食　米蠧又在造謠生事　說香港轉口之米將生周折午後米價又掀起囤戶作風</h3>
<p>洋米又有到滬、太古公司寗海輪、昨午抵埠、由香港裝來洋米一千二百九十八包、停靠法租界外灘碼頭起卸、怡和洋行泰生輸、亦於昨日下午一時許到滬、由香港裝來洋米三百九十三包、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>
<p>洋米自前朝一度回軟後、昨日早市、一般店胃、詎又乘廉動辦、賣戶又奇貨可居、價曾提上半元左右、若特別火絞開八十二元八角、小絞七十四元八角、終以市貨擁擠、一動即懈、迄中市漲勢漸殺、頓見平穩、近午市面繼跌、收盤行情、恢復前日原盤、然至下午、米商又散播香港不發許可通運證之說、轉口貨將遭困難、目下待轉尤多阻折、因此執貨者趁機扳俏、而補空與添囤尤為興濃活潑、市面立即飛騰、步步上升、尤以期貨因客囤爭辦為俏、一號西貢二月份早市九十四元、下午開高至九十五元、九十六元、九十六元半、三月上期上午九十三元半及九十四元、下午至九十五元半、小絞現八十八元、下午喊九十元、一月十五六日上午八十七元六角、下午亦喊至近九十元、二月份上午八十七元、下午喊八十九元、計陡漲二元、反比前晚較大一元矣、但新交易又有碎米二千噸、慎記售出、一二號混合米七十五元半、三號碎六十五元半、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米到貨雖仍不多、然本鄕去路亦淡、致市色平疲、除厚粳以到銷相仿、猶乏軒輊外、其薄稻則又貶落半元、計開靑角斛見薄稻九十四元半至九十四元、原包九十八元、常幫特別原白粳則仍為百零七元、斛見百零二元半、崑山原白粳百零四五元、斛見百零一元、次至九十六七元、</p>
<p>糯米昨供求相埒、市乏變化、香港高白元依然八十元、大市白元七十九元至七十八元半、特別乏貨未開、</p>
<h3>洋粉可無問題　—拋出已見增加—</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日粉市已轉疲風、蓋以澳洲洋粉路貨逐有拋開、及來源問題未必過於阻礙、是以人心帶軟、浮戶略有傾吐、上午開市一度擯持、嗣即做開花鳥鐘樓牌澳粉二十四元八角、比上日降小一角、又開路貨二十四元五角、成交近萬包、聞客戶方面、竟在抑價而取、更在米價低路下、恐尚有一度醞釀、又有聚寶盆粉亦開過二三百包、價二十四元四角、華廠粉仍售二十三元、由兩廠批出六千包光景、客幫交易、仍未接受、</p>
<p>小麥　市塲交星淸淡逾恒、內地偶有來貨、大都直接配廠、尤以日廠門市收去為多、實緣環境關係、悉被某方統制、故華廠欲購無貨、惟有仰賴洋麥之接濟、聞福新廠定麥一船、不日即可抵埠云、</p>
<h3>金融　華行塞出徉商進　外滙供求適相稱</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美匯暗市、午盤尚稱活潑、惟上落仍微、乃華商投機家進金子猛寒外匯、但悉為外銀行妥吸、市價未受影響、尤以某美行進胃最富、美匯本月份均成交五元三一二五、後市平平、幾乏做開、人心咸定、延至晚收結果、與午刻無異、現貨英金三便士三二八二五、美匯五元三一二五、較之隔昨、亦絲毫未有上落、</p>
<p>美行收買最殷</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠期均平、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對守滬等不動、美對英滬等未更、對法無市、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三便三二八一二五、美匯五元三一二五、悉與隔昨收市價相平、開後以華商銀行供塞、絡繹不絕、市面見硬、計售予英行有利現貨美匯為五元三四三七五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅亦乏上落、此後市面仍有隱約之利空消息、故華商投機家賣出、但外行均具吃胃、尤以某美行買入最夥、價頗平穗、計本月份美匯由有利麥加利某美行扒入投機商五元三一二五、迄至午刻、聞華商投譏家又售下月份美匯、為華行東亞購進、價五元二八一二五、收盤沉寂、現貨英匯三便士三二八一二五、美匯五元三一二五、</p>
<p>後市乏人問津</p>
<p>後市呆滯、英美兩匯、均無人間津、於是交易亳無、價格不變、晚收與午盤全同價、現貨及本月份英匯三便士三二八一二五、美匯五元三一二五、三月份英匯三便士三一二五、美匯五元二八一二五、比上日收市價、未有軒輊、</p>
<p>香港美匯略鬆</p>
<p>香港六日（週四）電、今晨匯市開盤平穩、各匯槪無榮辱、十一時三十分平穩、各匯仍無上落、下午二時三十分吿平、美匯現貨鬆〇六二五、為二十三元八七五、申匯現貨升五角、為四百四十九元、其餘不動、</p>
<p>天津英美平定</p>
<p>天津六日（週四）電、今日匯市晨開吿平、倫敦及紐電匯、均無榮辱、仍站三便士六五六二五、及五元八四三七五、申匯亦無變化、仍開九十元〇五角、「聯鈔」暗盤獨昂一元、為七十八元二角五分、</p>
<h3>期貨堅定　現金步高　約昂七八十元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤、疲中拉上、始終堅守六千六百七十元以上、一度反升達六千七百零五元、此因美匯因美國凍結資金有可能性、致呈走鬆之態、匯票商前兩日套出後、今又套轉、乃生買風、如開後大豐裕豐永合盛成記等搜納、始吿晋至六千七百零五元、午刻定住於六千六百九十元、後市開出甚好、曾達六千七百元、以銀號天元等吐售、最低見六千六百七十六元、收盤結果則為六千六百八十三元、比上日軋漲六元、現金仍步高不上、時和出德孚一百三十兩、照期交高七十元、一大出公和一百兩、高七十五元、下午恒記出同康永福康永天元德孚九十兩、高八十元、期貨交易約七千兩、飾金關金等仍平云、</p>
<p>烚赤無大上落</p>
<p>晨初承上日怠風之餘、人心依然不振、開盤各幫競塞、壓低二十餘元、始吿開盤價為六千六百五十元、惟因滙市有趨鬆之勢、匯票商復套進烚赤、一面吐出美匯、故不久買戶與時俱來、如大豐·裕豐永·合盛·成記等一致搜入、冉冉向上、出六千七百元大關、最昂達六千七百零五元、惟成記及祥興永等多頭稍有出籠、漲勢受阻、緩降入六千七百元關內、退至六千六百八十二元、此後盤旋少起伏、延至午後、穩吿六千六百九十元、午後初開甚好、吿六千六百九十五元、日不久檯面之夥搶購、再高五元、到六千七百元、奈天元等銀號幫忽　買風、力售至六千六百七十七元、尙賴鑫元大豐等來吸、回升至六千六百九十元、終因天元等續吐、吿六千六百八十三元收盤、比上日軋升六元、又現貨初由大德成德孚進聚豐永景福等二三百兩、價比期貨大七十元、後合和入益大一百兩、達七十五元、午後德孚恒記售予天元同康共九十兩、為八十元、以後相彷彿、期貨全日五十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售價、較烚赤高十飲元、收進低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元、均解做開、</p>
<p>飾金兌價不動</p>
<p>銀樓飾金每兩兌出價大同行掛六百九十元、未動、新同行與上價相仿、收進低三十元云、</p>
<h3>外幣所漲甚微</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價起落不定、終稍趨漲、英美金鎊略漲後旋即回平、美金票由十八元五角而步高至六角、卒為十八元五角半、比上日微漲三分、香港票需要仍殷、市價續漲一分、日金票繼續趨漲、晚市高至一元六角五分、朝鮮票略趨較化、晚市退為一元三角一分、</p>
<h3>證券　公債市塲之壁壘觀</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日市况頹勢未止、惟跌風似已稍殺、環境幷無變化、而人心虛弱仍未减退、一方面領鈔可做、一方面領鈔滿期、吸收自吸牧、吐出仍吐出、雙方雖屬旗鼓相當、在市塲賣方似為隨市、買方則乘低收買、一方擇價一方不擇價、其中相差即應殊、觀開盤丙種市價與隔日六十四元七角相埒此後即緩緩下降、遽小一元餘、經多方吸收後、忽又回好八角、多空競爭、且下仍為空方佔優勢、但雙方陣勢已比前為優、前之賣方為大戶、現在賣方為散戶、前之買方為散戶、現在買方為大戶、如在此種形勢上觀測、多方入後仍佔便宜、不過在眼前不無吃虧耳、觀昨日賣方如信孚胡鶴記潤利易中裕興數家、每家賣出均不過十餘萬、其餘如甡昶久豐敦餘以及零星散戶則為數已屬有限、買方則同康一家、買進約有五十餘萬、其餘如十六號新華、二十五號生大、三十八號恒康、每家均收進十餘萬、更有萬春吸收丙戊兩種約有二十萬以上、均係自行收貨、幷不劃暢、餘如聯和信昌大通仁昌恒孚聯益或多或少、均有相當數目收進、可見公債本身無問題、無非庸人自擾、且目下所跌已鉅、當必有相當的維持、市價結果、再跌五角至七角半不等、成交總數約計二百二十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交新亞藥廠股五十股、價為三十二元正、</p>
<p>衆業股市開盤略堅、入後黯淡非凡、會德豐最高曾見一〇九元、此價招致賣方大量出籠、收盤一〇六元有買戶、其餘各股成交亦稀、橡皮股仍無起色、</p>
<p>倫敦五日（週三）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商股票掛牌行市、仍吿平滯、行情槪無上落、</p>
<h3>紗花　又有拖進棉紗　雙馬轉跌為漲</h3>
<p>紗市始疲繼堅、但趨勢尚稱挺秀、惟現紗銷路不旺、然多方購買心氣異常興奮也、證券幫及明豐號復來躉批的拖進、於是檯面乾枯、市盤乃轉弱為强、高低之差額、有三四十元之巨、廿支雙馬最高價為一千五百十二元、低價為一千四百七十六元、午後始做一千五百十七元、繼為一千五百十元、又棉紗今日有一千九百三十五件、運往香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、因上日午後人氣不振、且空頭非常活躍、所以大都觀望不前、首盤價為一千四百八十元、微跌至一千四百七十六元、此時檯面上時上時下、盤旋在四五元之間、約有一小時半之多、後以證券幫大量的吸進、額子甚巨、同時稍有利多謠言、由此塲中買風驟熾、浮空驚惶而活動抵補、市盤逐步前進、市價越做越昂至一千五百十一元收盤、查半日間成交統計七千〇四十包、行情二十支雙馬漲二十元、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分別如左、</p>
<p>同行　七、〇〇〇　香港　四〇　統計　七、〇四〇</p>
<h3>廠商觀望　棉價稍低</h3>
<p>現棉情况、轉入平淡之途、廠方之納胃較滯、至於同行亦不及前日之興奮也、所以市態稍見下降矣、又棉花昨（六日）由香港來三百十六件、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、先因南方幫套賣而跌、繼之又因華爾街股票堅昂、及同業買進而回漲、結果較之上日收盤價格、略高一二磅音、印度市况平平、昨日連同預測微沒一羅比左右、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、良以棉價步漲握有手貨者、既不肯輕易脫售、同時廠方亦因價高而轉取觀望態度、是以市况雖堅但成交却無幾、然終究棉市脚地堅實、紗價又平穩安定、故預測棉市將來、又當樂觀無疑也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　廠盤不鬆　棉布始跌終漲</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市跌後返漲、趨勢堅穩、乃以浮多雖傾向賣出、而廠盤不鬆、經同業乘廉吸進後、又轉高翔、但結果白貨粗細布斜紋尚跌每疋二角半至五角、漂染布一部份跌每疋五角左右、細紗貨最稱堅俏、四十二支素府綢售每碼一元四角半至一元五角半、富貴細布晨最低售四十四元五角、午後回至四十五元二角半、本街成交各布三百餘件、浙路溫甬幫辦色布漂布等一百餘件、閩幫辦色布色斜府綢等近百件、粵港幫辦色斜藍布等一百數十件、今日有疋頭二百九十五件運香港、</p>
<p>東布　晨跌午回、市勢轉昂、白貨龍頭細布晨盤最低價做開四十九元二角、嗣以紗價上升、散戶又來拖納、遂步同高、收盤時成交為四十九元八九角、後市因期貨續漲、人心益堅、暗盤現棧單升至五十元零三角、四君子嗶嘰一元三角五分半、</p>
<p>「取引所」下午收盤價、二月份五十一元二角、三月份五十二元七角二分、四月份五十三元五角半、五月份五十四元三角、俱較前月回漲每疋五角至一元左右、</p>
<h3>油餅　餅價稍回　豆油突漲</h3>
<p>豆餅　昨日期貨市况、因賣氣見盛、市風步瀉、後由多頭力爭、强行拉抬、行情比前市祇有三四分上落、計開甡記三月上三萬片、價自十五元二角半至十五元一角二分、復為十五元二角、又三月下二萬片、價自十五元四角至十五元三角、復至十五元三角八分、元隆二月下五車、價為十五元二角半、三月下十車、價為十五元三角一分至三角半、肥字二月上十車、價為十五元二角半至三角、現餅因各方辦胃呆滯、以致貨方恐久扳乏利、故取甩價引銷之途、首由內地幫殺進利字餅六千片、價為十四元八角、甡記餅一千片、價為十四元九角、香港幫追踪辦去發字餅三千片、價為十四元九角半、行情一致比前甡削四角左右、</p>
<p>豆油　連朝下跌、昨晨初依然不支、入後有利買方之風突起、不論期現油一致轉升、結果反超出上日收盤價、市稍漲起半元至譜、計成交大連油三百桶、價為一百十八元至一百十七元七角半、復廻升至一百十九元二角半、又期油五百桶、計二月下價為一百十八元五角至一百十九元七角半、三月上一百二十元零五角至一百二十元、復升至一百二十一元七角半、及大有廠油五十担、價為九十三元云、</p>
<p>出口　雜糧、今（七日）有豆子一千二百八十五包、及豆餅九千五百八十張、俱運香港、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗白回小</h3>
<p>昨糖市無甚上落、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白外棧一月十日打單八十一元五六角、小一二角、二十日打單八十一元七八角、二十四日打單仍八十一元九角、二月底打單八十二元、小二角、三月十日打單八十二元四角、荷棉白BS嘜七十九元九角、升四角、太古車白B嘜西棧八十一元三角、不動、DY嘜七十八元九角、HX嘜七十八元八角、晶明冰一百〇四元、</p>
<h3>五金黑鐵坯子　飛黃騰達</h3>
<p>五金市况自紅盤開出後、各貨狂漲頗厲、均約較前價高出二分之一倍左右、因之業中人心思殊硬、而買主却多不敢動辦、故交易並不十分熱鬧、然就中黑鐵坯子一貨、市塲問津者獨多、致成交獨暢、一時市象飛黃騰達、有貨者心思更挺、問價節節上升、比之紅盤又昂一二百元不等、查昨日之開出價、已須一千六百元、又錫昨由香港來一百五十三塊、</p>
<h3>念九年份之上海粉市（續）</h3>
<p>— 周錫賡</p>
<p>設每戶需粉三包半，則約計七千餘包。其他尚有餅乾廠，糖果店，點心店，調味品廠，紗廠，家用等銷數，不計在內。如以伊時粉廠每日產粉九千餘包而言，供求原可接近，不致發生懸殊之感。特上海游資孔多，投機者乘機操縱，市上人心為之搖動不止。工部局有鑒及此。於九月下旬又出任調劑，（每包為十六元八角連手續費），故粉市為之漸入於平和之局。如此維持，自九月二十七日至年底為上。平賣紛前後共計舉辦三期，惟至去年十二月間，本廠粉原料關係，减額供給，所缺之數，由工部局擇維大，合義，達孚，怡和，公利諸洋粉進口行所到申之洋粉中，提十分之一，彌補所缺之本廠平價粉，價亦仍照本廠粉，平民獲益，誠非淺鮮。</p>
<p>雜牌粉與換袋粉</p>

<h3>興中風潮節外生枝　關係方面準備仲裁　雙方各趨端調處已瀕絕境　今日不能解決明日實施仲裁</h3>
<p>（大華設）本市金神父路羣賢別　私立興中中學、於上學期行將結束時、一部份敎員要求改善待遇未遂、發生怠敎風潮、經關係方面調處解決各情、迭誌各報、茲値學期更始、詎又節外生枝、校方態度堅決、敎員再度離校、雖經竭力調處、終仍陷於決裂、關係方面認爲雙方各趨極端、已瀕絕境、即將實施仲裁以了懸案、茲分誌各情如决、</p>
<p>初次風潮　前因後果</p>
<p>按該校初决發生怠敎風潮、係在上學期行將結束之時、參加怠敎奢爲女敎員八人、其原提條件、爲（一）本學期一月份發給雙方、（二）下學期起加薪五成、（三）下學期起以六個月計薪、（四）不得無故辭退敎職員、（五）不得任意侮辱敎員、（六）不住校敎員酌給米貼、經調處結果、校方接受下列各項、計（一）下學期起加薪三成至四成、（二）決不藉故辭退敎職員、（三）各敎員均可住宿校中、當時風潮消弭、雙方亦相安無事、</p>
<p>節外生枝　二度怠敎</p>
<p>詎至本學期開學時、該校校長吳靜波、以此入敎員中有徐蘅吳天競兩人、原爲代課敎員、與校方原無聘的關係、認爲可以不受上項調處協定之拘束、故一方面仍請原任敎員到校供職、一方面通知各代課敎員母庸代理、結果內有一原任敎員、退還聘的、不願應聘、即由該校長另聘他人接充、糾紛遂由此引起、各該敎員以代課敎員徐蘅吳天競服務已近半年、該校長不予正式聘任、而必欲原任敎員回校供職、顯係玩弄手段、以遂其藉故解職之企圖、遂一致提出抗議、要求正式聘任該兩代課敎員爲正式敎員、該校長既嚴詞拒絕、而其夫人劉敎復（亦任該校科任敎員）又復出言不遜、各敎員認爲侮辱、局勢乃愈陷僵持、馴至造成二决怠敎之不幸事件、</p>
<p>調解決裂　準備仲裁</p>
<p>二次怠敎後、各該敎員即環請關係方面繼續派員調處、當派原調解人負責處理、但幾經奔走、終鮮成效、而該敎員中有三人、忽又自動復職、照常上課、其餘葛鳳珍等諸人、則一方面憤而辭職、表示決心、一方面濫肆宣傳、罔顧大體、局勢遂愈形惡化、雖經關係方而於昨晨另行派員作最後之調處、促令學校當局勿關閉最後談判之鬥、但結果仍告失敗、調解遂終於決裂、關係方面爲迅謀解決計、刻正準備實施仲裁、並先予敎員劉郭復即該校校長夫人、以嚴重警告云、</p>

<h3>上課的第一天</h3>
<p>— 郭文牆</p>
<p>在上海（不知其它地方是不是），學校的「開學」與「上課」是脫節的。這就是說，開學是不立刻上課的，上課還須在開學後數天。</p>
<p>今天—開舉校後三天—學校上課了。</p>
<p>人頭擠擠，同學都拿了新書來上課了，有些還將新書用「畫面紙」包裹起來，顯出怪愛惜東西的樣子。同學大多是舊的，只有一二個新的揷班生。</p>
<p>第一課，第二課完了，同學們興高彩烈在談笑。</p>
<p>「今天老方爲什麼不來上課？」小陳首先打開了話匣子。</p>
<p>「不要說今天了，明天他也恐怕不來上課了。聽說今年他不再升學。」有了一個同畢在回答。</p>
<p>「誰說的？」</p>
<p>「這還有誰說的，是他自已說的。前天我碰見過他。」</p>
<p>「這是爲了什麼，讀完這半年就要畢業啦。」同學們都在說了。</p>
<p>「還不是繳不出學費嗎？木學期學費又加了十二元。」</p>
<p>老方是學校的高材生，個子不很高，身體很瘦，口才伶俐，可惜家裹太貧了，朝不保夕地過活，聽說他的父親是在船上做事的。人是很和氣的。</p>
<p>「老方不會去考各校舉辦的獎學金嗎？」小陳又在發問</p>
<p>「或許會的。」結果還是小陳回答自己。</p>
<p>小陳和老方是很要好的同學，可謂莫逆之交。當然小陳聽到了老方將要失學，他是很不安的。現在他又在作着宣傳的話了，他企圖用集體的力量不使老方失學。</p>
<p>「各位老友，老方是本級的高才生，他現在因無法繳學費而失學，這是饅痛心的事，……我們應該幫助他，在物質上…」</p>
<p>聲音由溫和而至憤激了。</p>
<p>感情的泛濫，是無法防止的，這時，大家都將一顆熱情的心暴露了出來。大家情不自禁地說：</p>
<p>「是的。」</p>
<p>「我們要幫助他！」</p>
<p>小陳很開心，他覺得他的設話收了很大的效果。於是他將圍着站着和坐着的同學，數了一决，舊的同學有三十三個，新的有二個，一共三十五個。小陳又在說話了了：</p>
<p>「首先，我幫助老方五元，希望各同學盡量捐助。」</p>
<p>話剛說完，同家叫着一元，二元，五角……</p>
<p>新的兩個同學也各捐一元</p>
<p>不多時，共收得四十三元五角。明天起，老方可以不失學了。大家非常快樂。</p>
<p>小陳忙着寫一封信，叫大家簽了各，意思是表明他們的友誼和熱情，由小陳做代表。</p>
<p>晚上，小陳到了老方家裏，老方被小陳帶來的一封信感動得落下淚來了。</p>
<p>爲了朋友，也是爲了國家，這是有意義的行動。</p>
<h3>隨筆</h3>
<p>— 周音基</p>
<p>「耶穌，亞們！」</p>
<p>親戚家的一個六歲的孩子跟一個七歲的女兒在法租界一所規模很大的敎會學校里唸書，可是至今整整的唸了一年書，却什麽都沒有學着；嘴里會的，僅僅紙兩句話：「耶蘇愛世人，我們亦愛耶蘇，亞們！」</p>
<p>活動鉛筆</p>
<p>我自己一個年靑的妹妹，在辣斐德路某女中唸書，今天當她到學校里去交留額費的時候，該校敎務主任竟以抽斗裹的「活動鉛筆」為號召，曰：如介紹學生一人即可贈送一枝等語。聞之，眞使人爲神聖之敎育事業的前途感嘆不止矣！</p>
<p>外國歌</p>
<p>友人某君，在一次談話里，偶然地對我這麽說二：「現在許多靑的男女學生嘴裡時常喜歡哼外國歌，可是說實說，有些就壓根兒沒有上過央文課，他（她）們唱「外國歌」恐怕還是用中文在旁邊註起來的呢。」當時，我竟被他引美得合不　嘴來。雖然這些是無意識的打趣話，但都是對現敎育一個極大的諷刺。</p>
<h3>變相的加學費</h3>
<p>— 莫冷</p>
<p>學校加了學費，敎員就可以藉口要求加薪，結果學費增加的部份，又因加薪而减少，於是乎學校不得不想一個十全十美的辦法，一方面要學費收入增加，一方面要使敎員們無求加薪的藉口，這種辦法很簡單，就是拼命的要學生補考，增加補考費。</p>
<p>弟弟接到了學校的通知單，所選的六種功課，竟有三樣需要補考，並且遺附了一張通知單，是：「自下學期起，補考費一律增至每課大洋五元。」起初我們還以爲弟弟的成績退步了，不料後來知道弟弟的同學須耍補考的，幾乎十有八九。</p>
<p>補考是因爲有一種學生的成績在將及格未及格之間，而給他們一種機會，這情形原本極少，而現在如是之多，我們不得不相信學校有更改學生成績的嫌疑。更改成績的方法，大的是將六七十分减少數分至十數分，甚至將三四十分的增加十數分，這樣就可以得到大部的補考同學。</p>
<p>每一同學都有一種至　種的補考成績，平均每人二種，則無異每學期增學費十元，而同時打着本校學費不加的幌子，並且對敎員們說，我們敎育界的工作最爲神聖，我們應當忍耐一切的痛苦爲敎育界服務。</p>
<p>淸寒畢生得到親友們的幫助，往往因成績不好而失學，可是這種不好的成績，並不是學生自己不用功。</p>
<p>以一敎育機關而用不正當的方法謀取漁利，聞之令人寒心；而誤人子弟，更是罪大惡極了！</p>
<p>數星期前，本欄發表「一個喜訊」一文後，行將遭受失學之苦的我，覺得這正是我得以繼續求第的一個絕好機會，</p>
<h3>淸寒獎學金應試記</h3>
<p>— 王</p>
<p>確是我儕淸寒學生的一個喜訊！</p>
<p>當犬晚上，寫了一封申請函，申請予以補助。</p>
<p>三星期後，回信來了，叫我在某月某日至該處面試。雖然這只是薄薄的一張明信片，上面只有寥寥的幾個字，可是，它賜給了我一朶得以繼續求學的希望之花。</p>
<p>一間不大不小小的客室，佈置得井井有條，陳列是中西合　，有名人的字畫，古董，有柔軟的沙發，克羅米的茶几，紅木的八仙桌，在一邊的牆上，更有一副難童敎養院院長袁禮敦氏手　的一聯，稱頌着主人的慈善的仁舉，這足以證明主人是一位樂善爲懷的長者。十幾個申請的學生，肅靜無　地圍坐在長圓桌旁，等待着考試。下午一時，考試開始了，中英文作文作文各一篇，中文題爲「自述」，英文題目是My　School　Life時後，應試者的考卷已全部批改完畢，得到獎學金的學生，次日即可至該處領取獎學金。很幸運地，我也是其中之一·</p>
<p>給我們獎學金而使我們得以繼續求學的，是一位姓潘的仁慈溫厚的長者。領取獎學金的時候，由潘先生親自詢問，然後發給獎學金。當我被叫到樓上詢問時，潘先生非常客氣地命我坐下，詞問完畢，對我講述下面一段話：</p>
<p>「當我在求學時代，也是一個貧苦淸寒的學生。爲了求學，時常遭遇種種困難。可是，我不灰心，畢竟是成功了。鑒於我當時求學時的困難情形，對於現時的淸寒學生，激動我的同情，所以每學期設了十名獎學金額，補助淸寒而優秀的學生。希望們不要辜負我的一番誠意，以後若有成就，也應當回憶到自己求學時，困苦情形，補助其他的淸寒學生。」</p>
<p>我領得了獎學金，心中充滿了快樂的情緒，因爲我又可繼續求學了。這裏，我代表全體淸寒學生，向潘先生致無限的敬意。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「其實她也不能算長，恰巧長得正好！臉上和身上都透着一股很可愛的秀氣，我眞喜歡她！每次吃飯，我總得不斷的旋過臉去看她！」另一個三年級的學生很天眞地說。</p>
<p>事實上，同學中歡喜羅湘綺的委實很多，她對待每一個人都非常和氣，儘管年年攷第一，却比年年留級的人遺沒有架子：儘管家裏很窮，却穿得比最有錢的人還整潔；敎師說的話，她都能很適稱地服從，但決不過分的阿諛；四年來從沒有犯過一件過失，即使是脾氣那麽古怪，事事歡喜挑剔的侯校長，也不能不暗暗承認　是她自己最得意的一個學生。</p>
<p>當侯校長決定派她充致謝詞的代表之後，他却出於人們意料之外的鎭靜，一般少女們所常有的那種假惺惺，甚全哭哭笑笑，推三阻四的許多做作，她一概沒有；同班幾個妒忌她的同學，雖然不斷的向她　諷，有的假裝替她歡喜，說上一大段比駡還凶的好話，有的假裝替她担憂，慫患她去向侯校長推辭，但羅湘綺的答復，却始終紙是淡然一笑而已。</p>
<p>眞的！湘綺對於這件事，心裏的確看得很輕。在侯校長沒有指定她充代表之前，她實在沒有希望別人推舉她的意思；待到侯校長把她的名字圈定之後，她立刻覺得這是一種很平常的義務，好比她三年來一直被指定充級長一樣，固然不足希罕，但也沒有推辭的必要。她想踏上講台去衝着自已全校的同學，和寥寥可數的幾個來賓的面前，像背書似的講上一般客氣括，這有什麽値得大驚小怪呢？講得好，人家也不過是拍一陣手完事；講得不好，人家也不見得就好把自己轟下來，左右是這麽一會事，不信反會比平常的功課難的；</p>
<p>難倒一些不難，可是這一段短短的謝詞，後來對於她自己所發生的影響，却委實不是她所預料得到的！她的生命的過程，竟因這一次十分鐘不到的演說，而從一條原是很平坦又且極少曲折的大道上，又到了另一條崎一不平，險象環生的小路上去。要是她事先就知道會有這樣的結果，她是一定寗顧被侯校長開除，抵死不顧充這一個不祥的代表的！　（二四）</p>

<p>逰藝界</p>
<p>新片介紹</p>
<h3>「寳劍留痕」</h3>
<p>— 程冰奴</p>
<p>二十年之前，范朋克的「俠盜壹祿」曾經轟動一時，二十年後的今日，泰羅鮑華的「寳劍留痕」，依然得到觀眾的愛好，無疑地，劇本的編製相當精緻，故事的發展，也檢盡緊張與曲折的能事。我沒有看過范朋克的「俠盜壹祿」，不能把兩片作一比較，可是想像起來，像狄埃哥這樣脚色，叫范朋克云演，叱咤風雲固然有餘，而個儘風流則未免不足。同樣地，泰羅鮑華我論怎樣賣力，他的叱咤風雲，總應該輸於老范的。</p>
<p>「寳劍留痕」的故事，是寫十八世紀西班牙的綠衫　民眾，在暴君唐路易斯統治之下，受到怎樣的虐待。當然，民眾不會永遠甘作牛馬，於是故事的主人公狄埃哥便以蒙面俠客的姿態，出來除暴安良。他有一身的好武藝，他會擊劍，他會躍馬，他敢公然揭云官吏增捐的吿示，也敢於深更夜半，闖進官邸，戲弄那個怯懦的暴君唐路易斯。</p>
<p>可是當他揭去了黑面布之後，他却又變作唐路易斯的友人，一個年少翩翩的佳公子，他接受唐夫人的挑逗，也接受洛麗泰的癡情，他省識風情，他懂得憐香惜玉，像這樣一個人物，當然是當時民眾眼光中的一位英雄，美人愛英雄，洛麗泰之種情於查祿，那是自然的道理。（附銅圖）</p>
<p>劇作者雖然沒有强調了男女主角的羅漫絲，但寫民眾所受的痛苦，以及由痛苦而起的反抗，似乎還嫌不足，同樣地，他寫狄埃哥的擊劍躍馬，也祇刻劃出一個生龍活虎的英雄來，而把支撐這位英雄的千萬無名小卒—民眾忽略了。這種為民除暴的手段，完全是個人英雄主義，如果領導這一暴動的不是狄埃哥，那彝有失敗的危險。</p>
<p>也許導演麥墨林知道這一缺陷，在最後逃獄這一高潮裏，特別强調了民眾的咆哮，助威，與參加反抗。那種偉大的塲面是够刺激的。至於全劇調子的輕快，畫面的簡潔流利，自然吾無閒言。泰羅鮑華的演技，比在「萬里關山裏好得多了。林黛達妮兒，也頗可愛，總之，這是一個値得一看的片子。</p>
<h3>觀申新二廠同樂彩排</h3>
<p>— 有愧</p>
<p>申新二廠平劇社例於農歷新作一年一度之彩排，旣率全體職工以同樂，復導以正當之消遣，免作無謂之靡費，法至善也。今春所演諸劇，頗為精彩，茲擷述之：</p>
<p>殊痕記　此劇係老戲，滬上殊少演出，由沈叔偉君飾朱春登，唱做俱佳，吃調正宮以上，設祭時大段反二簧，為全劇精彩處；余璋基君之趙錦棠，與沈君功力悉敵，身段尤見平穩；吳琦君之朱春科，頗收綠葉之助。</p>
<p>八大鎚　陳受之君之五佐　劉小農君之陸文龍，趙錦紳君之乳娘，陳君唱宗余，不失水準，斷臂時之吊毛，高而輕，頗見功夫，脫書一段，背陸與乳娘幾句對白眼神，尤見出色。（附劇照）</p>
<p>法門寺　李瑞庭君之趙廉，唱勝於做，下塲時於大段慢板二六之後，「放大胆」三字一句拔高，難能可貴。</p>
<p>六月雪，郡曾　小姐之　娥，扮相淸秀，佳嗓天賦，唱學程，頗具根底。這環套，劉小農君飾黃天霸，許景　君去　爾墩；劉君年少英俊，扮相絕妙，唱做白口，更具英雄氣槪；許君嗓音洪亮，一段流水，斬釘截鐵；吳琦君反串賀天龍，這鏢時與劉君幾記開打，緊湊純熟，洵非易事。</p>
<p>三娘敎子　朱仲華君去王春娥，出塲引子，平穩無疵，幾段二簧，唱來凄涼婉轉，十分動聽；周甘澍君之薜保，遵守老派，臉上不用脂粉，唱學五少樓；飾倚哥之李文蓉小妹妹，係李瑞庭君之千金，說白老練，表情活潑，為是劇生色不少。</p>
<p>打漁殺家　葉乃君之蕭恩，一舉一動，不失英雄本色，「昨夜晚」一段原板頗動聽。</p>
<p>是日由十二時半演至六時半紿畢，全塲觀眾，秩序頗佳，據該廠平劇社負責人稱：「最近期內，將再度公開彩排，願海上顧曲諸公不吝賜敎。」</p>
<h3>崑曲集會誌盛</h3>
<p>老名畫家樊少雲氏，於繪事之餘，恒藉音樂歌曲自娛，昨夕在大西路美麗園庽邸，邀集殷震賢俞振飛吳景略張子謙嚴麗貞及其哲嗣樊伯炎等拍曲以佐雅興，諸氏均屬音樂戲曲大家，各奏名曲，悉臻美備，最後兩曲係俞振飛譜聲，樊伯炎吹笛，嗣殷震賢奏曲，俞派飛吹逮，更唱迭和，眾美畢具，洵盛集也。</p>
<h3>藝壇散記</h3>
<p>— 守燕</p>
<p>如晦為張冀鵬編的改良京戲「新西遊記」，題材為採自明末遺民的「西遊補」小說者。魏近正忙於編著「國難文學史」，故編好分塲後，唱辭將交由張自已編寫。</p>
<p>民華的「古口國之歌」同樂會，唱是勢所必唱，日期則決定在「古口國之歌」攝影塲工作完畢以後，預算一下，當在一月之後，那時候那座戲台也許要改裝一下，改得小一點，以便可多排一點座位，多容納一些嘉賓。至於劇目，則除吳承達沈琪兩君之「雙五花洞」正在向孫梅兩女士徵求同意外，其他的都未談起，或者，說不定來一下「羣英會」云。</p>
<p>張冀鵬演「孫悟空棒打萬年靑」後，將演李元覇；再後，則將演「大俠甘鳳池」，該劇出裴冲手筆，為新編者，預計於陰歷二月初左右公演，屆時更新且擬出一本精彩浩大的特刊。</p>
<p>沈浮已榮任西北攝影公司副廠長之職，可喜可賀。聞蔡楚生與司徒慧敏等將在港為之導演一片，以資捧塲。</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops in Southern Henan Stage General Retreat; Remnants Southeast of Wuyang Cleared; Southwest of Bo County Two Strongholds Successively Recaptured by Chinese; Japanese Troops Invading Guangdong Blocked Between Danshui and Huizhou</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Military News: (1) Various units of the Chinese army in southern Henan are pursuing the defeated Japanese troops. The Chinese forces fiercely pursued the enemy along the Pinghan Railway front towards Suiping, killing over a thousand Japanese soldiers in fierce fighting until the morning of the 5th. The remaining Japanese troops are retreating south. Southwest of the Pinghan Railway, in the southeastern area of Wuyang, the remnants of the Japanese forces encircled and annihilated by the Chinese have been almost completely wiped out. Japanese troops retreating from Nongfeng were severely defeated at Zhao Yin Town and Jishang, suffering heavy casualties. Japanese troops retreating southwest from Wuyang were also surrounded and fiercely attacked by the Chinese. In fierce fighting until the morning of the 6th, the Japanese left behind over four thousand corpses and broke through to flee. Chinese troops are still continuing their pursuit. (2) One night, Chinese forces attacked Japanese strongholds at Wulongkou and other places across from Yichang. The Japanese responded with heavy artillery fire. The Chinese troops bravely charged, breaking through multiple points in the Japanese barbed wire defenses, killing many Japanese soldiers. (3) Japanese troops in Jiangxi advanced towards the Fujiang area on the morning of the 5th. After engaging with the Chinese army, fierce fighting continued until noon. The Japanese briefly infiltrated Dagu, but the Chinese army launched a fierce counterattack and recaptured Dayu, killing over two hundred Japanese soldiers. (Report of the 6th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Military Spokesperson said that the war situation in Henan has changed in favor of the Chinese army, and the Japanese army is now in general retreat. (United Press report of the 6th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong – After the Japanese army occupied Danshui and Shayu Chong, land transportation between Hong Kong and Shaoguan was completely cut off. Several Japanese transport ships arrived at Dapeng Bay yesterday, reportedly preparing to attack Huizhou. According to Chinese sources, the Japanese army is currently only between Danshui and Huizhou. The situation on the Hong Kong border remains normal, with no influx of refugees. According to reports from Chongqing, the Chinese authorities have not yet announced details of the Japanese landing in Dapeng Bay and the government does not pay much attention to the Japanese attempt to cut off transportation between Hong Kong and mainland China, or regards it as unimportant. Some goods have been smuggled across the Japanese naval blockade from Shayu Chong into mainland China, but these goods are all transported by private merchants and the quantity is relatively small, so the Japanese occupation of Shayu Chong has no serious impact on the import of important overseas goods into mainland China. (Reuters report of the 6th)</p>
<p>Luoyang – Chinese troops in eastern Henan have recaptured the Shizi River southwest of Bo County and the San Guan Temple south of Bo County. (Report of the 6th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong – Japanese troops who landed at Ao Tou in Daya Bay near Shenzhen and invaded Danshui suffered heavy losses at the hands of the Chinese army. (Report of the 6th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong – After the Japanese forces occupied Shayu Chong yesterday morning, ferry services between the town and British territory have now been suspended. The Chinese army had anticipated Japanese action and withdrew in advance, so there was little fighting in Shayu Chong. The Japanese forces included three thousand soldiers, an aircraft carrier, a cruiser, and three destroyers. (Reuters report of the 6th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – A Chinese military spokesperson told reporters today that after two weeks of fierce fighting in Henan province, the Japanese army has suffered over 20,000 casualties. At the beginning of this week, two routes of the Japanese army advanced north from their bases established last week. Among them, 6,000 men advanced along the railway line from Queshan and arrived at Sui Ban on the 31st, engaging in battle with the Chinese army. After suffering about 5,000 casualties, the Japanese troops moved west and arrived at Wuyang on the same day. The second route of Japanese troops departed from Bao’an on January 29th and engaged in battle with the Chinese army at Xianghe Pass, lasting for five days. The Japanese army suffered over 9,000 casualties. The Japanese army moved northwest and captured Fangcheng on February 3rd. The Chinese army moved south from the north. The Japanese army then moved south, and this Japanese force has now reached the southeast of Nanyang. At the same time, between these two major routes of the Japanese army, there are also several small Japanese raiding units engaging in harassment. The Japanese divisions involved in this operation were drawn from northern Hunan and western Hubei, so the strength of the Japanese army in China has not increased. The area of operations covers 200 kilometers. The Japanese army used its mechanized units. In Guangdong province, the fighting continues as the Japanese army attempts to cut off the supply route between Hong Kong and Shaoguan. (Reuters report of the 6th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to reliable war reports received here recently, the battles in various areas since the end of last month are as follows: In Henan Province, Chinese and Japanese armies are fighting fiercely in the area between Wuyang and Da Nian Yuan, southwest of the city. This area is where the main force of the Japanese army is located, and the Chinese army is also constantly reinforcing its forces, so the development of the situation deserves great attention. The activities of the Japanese army in western Anhui and the Kaifeng area have suffered major blows from the Chinese army. The Japanese army advancing north from Jingmen and Dangyang in Hubei province has been frustrated in Yuan’an, northern Hubei, and is retreating to its original positions.

<h3>Soong Tzu-wen's Conversation with American Reporters: During the Period of Resistance and Reconstruction, China Will Be United Against Foreign Enemies; Only Chiang Can Lead the National War Effort</h3>
<p>New York – Soong Tzu-wen, the head of the Bank of China, told Maurer, a reporter from the Chicago News Agency, that the unfortunate friction between General Chiang Kai-shek and the Communist Party would not lead to civil war as generally expected in the United States. The New York newspaper, which obtained the above news of the interview from the Chicago News Agency, reported that Soong said that this friction would not lead to open civil war during the continuation of the anti-Japanese war, that is, before China achieved victory. Soong has been in the United States for several months and is an unofficial representative specially appointed by the government afterwards. The Chinese Embassy in Washington announced today that Soong is currently suffering from a cold, but the illness is not serious. Soong said in the above interview that there is a possibility of friction between Chongqing and the Chinese Communist Party. He pointed out that before the Sino-Japanese War, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party fought each other for ten years. It is said that Soong said, "After we defeat Japan, the Chinese Communist Party may become the radical faction in a free government." Soong also said that he does not believe that there are more than 250,000 Communist troops now, or 10% or 20% of the total number of Chinese troops. Soong said that this number is actually too much. Maurer asked Soong why Chiang continued to accept Soviet supplies after this friction occurred. Soong replied that Moscow recognized that most of the Chinese fighting forces were under Chiang's control, and only Chiang could lead the national war effort. Soong also pointed out that the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party supported Chiang. (United Press report of the 6th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>US Presidential Representative Currie Arrives in Chongqing</h3>
<p>According to news from Hong Kong last night, Currie, the representative sent to China by US President Roosevelt, arrived in Hong Kong from Manila the day before yesterday, and left Hong Kong for Chongqing yesterday. As of the time the reporter is writing, there has been no further report, but based on the expected itinerary, he should have arrived safely in Chongqing. Currie is the Deputy Director of the US President's Office (?), and a statistical expert who studies economic realities. It is said that his main tasks in coming to China are: first, to deliver the President's private letter to Chinese Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in person; and second, to investigate China's economic realities. Some say that the United States is planning to provide China with a huge loan, and Currie's investigation report will be used as a reference for the decision. However, this rumor has been clearly denied by the Chinese and American authorities.</p>
<p>We welcome Currie to China and to Chongqing. We are ashamed that we cannot make any substantial contribution in terms of figures to Currie. However, the Chongqing authorities have indicated that after Currie arrives in Chongqing, they will be open and honest about everything he needs to investigate and know, and will provide him with the greatest convenience. Therefore, the object of Currie's mission will surely obtain what he needs and there is no need for us to elaborate on it. What we wish to elaborate on is beyond substantial figures.</p>
<p>We do not believe that the rumored tasks of Currie's visit to China are the entirety of his true mission. We also do not want to delve into what Currie's true mission actually is, but we hope that Currie will pay attention to: Firstly, the clear and resolute policy of the United States towards the Far East and China is well known to us. However, we would like to supplement the American government and the public with the explanation that when the United States decides to implement all its measures under its policy, at least at present, it must get rid of its habitual commercial attitude and change its routine commercial methods. We admit that the so-called "commercial" is the most practical, reliable, and enduring standard, which is not only suitable for the normal norms and ideals of the United States, but also what China, which respects faith, is willing to study. However, the so-called extraordinary period now is not only because China has encountered aggression, which makes it extraordinary, but also because the entire international community and the future of the world are in an unprecedented extraordinary period. Because of its extraordinary nature, the United States should take a broad and long-term view and take it as the standard for deciding everything. Change when you are poor, and change will lead to success. It is not appropriate to be confined to habitual and normal norms and ideals. Secondly, today's China is in the stage after starting the War of Resistance and going through forty-three months. Many important cities have been captured, a wide area of fertile land has been occupied, and most of the coastal and river areas have been blockaded. During this period and under these circumstances, it is absolutely impossible to judge superficially. Only the Chinese who know themselves and have confidence, as well as experts with true knowledge and foresight, can understand how strong the potential power that China possesses is, and that it can be used as a basis for continuing the long-term War of Resistance. Therefore, we hope that Currie's investigation will pay attention to tracing back from the present to the past, and even more predicting the future from the present, so that he can clearly understand what a magnificent and rich civilization group and a living group this great country with a history of five thousand years is. Thirdly, China's politics, economy, society, and everything else, measured by modern standards, are indeed not as good as they should be. Therefore, if everything is measured by Western and scientific standards, it is often difficult to know the real situation in China. We do not know how we can help Currie understand everything in China, but we might as well point out a general outline to help understand China. In short, China, from society and business to the army and politics, is full of innate factors of flesh and blood compatriots. It may be assumed that this is a kinship-based, family-based nation. Looking at the unemployment problem in peacetime and the refugee problem in wartime, the actual situation, no matter how difficult and arduous, is very different from what Europeans and Americans and European and American countries imagine. This one point should be used to deduce and consider other issues. If one must take figures as the standard and statistics as the standard, then not only will there be various disappointments, but there will also be various unnecessary pessimism and disappointment. Fourthly, we do not need to repeat the process of diplomatic relations between China and the United States in history. As for the present: China is one of the belligerent countries, and the United States is one of the neutral countries. The positions seem to be completely different. However, from the obedience of democratic governance, the safety and interests of the Pacific Ocean's future, the belief in human civilization and international treaties, and the desire to resist aggression, China and the United States are completely standing in the same camp and completely heading towards the same destination. This is well known to President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, Currie, and the general public of the United States. What we still want to say is that China regards resistance and construction, both now and in the future, as two sides of the efforts made by the Chinese nation, and they are by no means two different things. The United States is now seeking to know about China, and must regard China's resistance and construction, both now and in the future, that is, assisting in combat and developing resources and markets, as the same thing and plan for it as a whole. In this way, we can obtain a greater and more accurate concept.</p>
<p>The above four points are sincerely hoped to be paid attention to by Currie, and what the reporter said is superfluous nonsense.</p>
<h3>US House Ends Debate, Lend-Lease Act to Be Voted on Soon; Bill to Build 200 Cargo Ships Passed; Halifax Meets Hull for Lengthy Talks</h3>
<p>Washington – Last night, the House of Representatives ended the general debate on the Lend-Lease Act, so that consideration of amendments can be implemented today. The House of Representatives meeting last night lasted until 1:50 pm, and the eloquent speeches finally ended. The total number of members who spoke in the three-day debate reached 111, and the number of speakers yesterday was as high as 64. House leaders have considered whether to accept amendments from the opposition in order to win over those who oppose the bill and obtain a unanimous vote. Democratic members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee also discussed some suggestions with Rayburn, a Democratic member of Congress from Texas and the majority leader in the House of Representatives, but no decision was made. Rayburn said that the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Administration may accept amendments that restrict the President's right to conclude treaties, do not use US warships for navigation, and set a limit on the expenses of this procedure. The most colorful debate last night was the fierce attack by Democratic member of Congress Marcantonio from New York on Britain and British Ambassador to the United States Halifax, who said that the current war is a battle between two gangs of imperialist thieves, one of which has already engaged in theft yesterday, and the other is attempting theft today. He also condemned Halifax, saying that he is an imperialist who betrayed the Spanish people, betrayed democratic countries, and sold out democratic countries in Munich. The House of Representatives is scheduled to consider amendments today or tomorrow, and the vote on the bill is scheduled to be implemented tomorrow or Saturday. (United Press report of the 6th)</p>
<p>Washington – House leaders yesterday considered accepting some amendments to the Lend-Lease Act proposed by the opposition in order to make the final vote a representation of national unity behind President Roosevelt's foreign policy. During the debate yesterday, Minnesota Republican member of Congress Knute Nelson, who voted against the war in 1917, said that the United States is now prepared to repeat the previous stupid things. Massachusetts Democratic member of Congress McCormack, who supports the bill, said that this bill is a "peace plan." Those who are "true warmongers" are those who oppose this bill. These people are ignorant and try to divide the American people. It must be known that such divisive means today will eventually lead to destruction. "Think about what Germany and the military-controlled Japan will impose on the United States once the Axis powers win!" (United Press report of the 6th)</p>
<p>Washington – Republican members of the House Ways and Means Committee yesterday opposed the government's raising of the national debt limit from US$49,000,000,000 to US$65,000,000,000 (an increase of US$16,000,000,000), calling it unnecessary and dangerous, and advocating raising it to US$60,000,000,000. The House of Representatives is scheduled to discuss this bill immediately after the debate on the President's Lend-Lease Act is completed. (United Press report of the 6th)</p>
<p>Washington – The House of Representatives yesterday accepted the Senate's amendment to the bill to build 200 cargo ships, so this bill has been sent to the White House for signature and implementation. President Roosevelt recently requested Congress to allocate US$313,000,000 for the construction of 200 cargo ships. (Reuters report of the 6th)</p>
<p>Washington – British Ambassador Lord Halifax met with Secretary of State Hull yesterday to discuss general issues between the two countries. The meeting lasted one hour before it ended. Hull told people that the British and American discussion on lifting the food blockade in the conquered areas is now waiting for strong evidence that can prove the extreme need for food in the area, but there has been no discussion of Britain lifting this blockade. (United Press report of the 6th)</p>
<p>Washington – The US Treasury Department yesterday notified the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the list of assets in the United States given by the British government indicated that the British government would soon be able to obtain US dollars to pay for war supplies. There are three large business companies run by the British, namely Lever Brothers, American Viscose Corporation, and Dunlop Tire Company, as well as other smaller private companies. The US Treasury Department's release of this information is to refute what General Wood said on Tuesday that he did not believe that the British assets list included all kinds of interests owned by the British in the United States.

<h3>American Military Supplies to Be Shipped to Britain via Iceland; Officials Are Discussing This Plan to Solve the Serious Problem of British Military Supplies</h3>
<p>Washington – Latin American diplomats recently told reporters that American officials and diplomatic circles are discussing a plan to use Iceland as a transshipment base for American military supplies to Britain. The plan is to allow American ships to transport military supplies to Iceland, because according to the interpretation of the American Neutrality Act, Iceland is a neutral country and is not within the war zone. American military supplies to Britain may be unloaded in Reykjavik and then loaded onto British ships and shipped to Britain. It is reported that this plan is under study by the Executive Department. It is generally believed that British military supplies are often lost due to German submarine attacks. This plan is a practical way to solve the serious problem of British military supplies. The main benefit of this plan is that it can reduce the distance required for British cargo ships and escorts to transport military supplies by two-thirds. As for American ships, they are currently not allowed to enter British territorial waters. The diplomat who reported this plan to the reporter was very supportive of it, saying that this method can increase the number of voyages for Britain to engage in this transportation from one to three times, and it can also allow Britain to transfer two-thirds of the warships currently serving as escorts in the Atlantic to other places for use, or it can make the escort work more intensive. The sea route from New York to Liverpool is 3,700 miles, while the route from Iceland to Liverpool is only 1,000 miles. The diplomat also pointed out that this plan can be implemented without amending the Neutrality Act, because since Denmark surrendered to Germany, Iceland has generally been recognized as an independent country and is therefore not affected by the Neutrality Act. Since Germany occupied Denmark, the United States has had practical interests in Iceland and has established a consulate in Reykjavik. Although American officials have not yet recognized this plan, Latin American diplomats said that the United States has recognized it as one of the possible means of helping Britain. The route between New York and Reykjavik is sometimes quite dangerous due to icebergs, but the United States has experienced patrolling teams that can warn ships to avoid danger in advance when they find a large amount of ice in the sea.

<h3>Willkie's Return to America via Portugal: Message to Germans Upon Leaving England, Opposing Aggression and Dictatorship</h3>
<p>Lisbon: Republican leader Wendell Willkie arrived here yesterday from London. He told reporters, "I have obtained the information I desired and am extremely satisfied." Willkie departed for New York on the "Dixie Clipper" at midnight. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>London: Willkie's visit to England has now concluded. In a message left for the German people, he stated, "I am a descendant of Germans. Our family name was originally Willeke, not Willkie. My ancestors left Germany ninety years ago because they were Protestant Christians who opposed autocratic politics and demanded the right to live freely. Today, I also demand this right. I am proud of my German blood, but I hate aggression and tyranny. Please tell the German people, the vast majority of my fellow German descendants share my beliefs. They also believe in freedom and human rights. Please tell the German people that we, German Americans, deeply mourn and condemn the current German government's acts of aggression and power-grabbing." (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Navy Secretary Announces: 100 Fighter Planes Shipped to China for Combat Use; Chinese Government Originally Planned to Purchase 500</h3>
<p>Washington: Navy Secretary Colonel Knox announced that China has purchased one hundred American fighter planes. It is understood that China originally planned to purchase five hundred. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington: Arrangements are currently being made here to supply China with one hundred military aircraft custom-made in England for the Xiangfu (likely a misspelling of 向甫, Xiàng Fǔ, referring to H. H. Kung) delegation, but these planes have not yet been delivered. The Chinese government had requested five hundred planes. After final negotiations, the British have agreed to deliver the first one hundred planes completed to China, and the later ones to Central (likely referring to the Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company). Navy Secretary Knox also announced that the U.S. Navy Department has agreed to provide Greece with thirty Grumman fighter planes without charge, but the Greek ambassador has declined, saying that Greece needs newer models. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington: Although U.S. Navy Secretary Knox announced yesterday that China was prepared to purchase one hundred planes from the U.S. Navy, the Navy Department stated that it was unaware of this purchase. The Chinese Purchasing Commission here also denied this news, but sources here said that China had long hoped to purchase five hundred American planes. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>Italian Forces in Africa Rapidly Retreating: British Forces Advancing Towards Benghazi; Attack on Keren Also Very Successful</h3>
<p>Cairo: The British offensive in various parts of Africa is progressing smoothly. A British communique announced today that the British forces in Libya are continuing to advance towards Benghazi. British forces on the Eritrean front are closing in on the Italian positions at Keren. Italian forces retreating from Barentu are now under pressure from British forces in the Duri area. To date, British forces have captured over 1,800 prisoners, mostly Italians, and countless military supplies. On the Abyssinian front, British forces are making good progress along the Gondar Road. The British forces have penetrated deeply into the areas of Italian Somaliland invaded by British forces. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Cairo: In the past thirty-six hours, the rate of retreat of Italian forces in Libya, Eritrea, and Abyssinia has greatly increased. They are using all roads to retreat towards the rear. Italian forces retreating towards Benghazi are moving twenty to thirty miles per day, suffering heavy casualties from concentrated British air raids. Following the Italian forces in their chaotic retreat are hundreds of Italians who settled in the area three years ago. British forces are following and pursuing them on two parallel roads from Cyrenaica to Benghazi, encountering very little resistance, as the countryside between the British front lines and Benghazi has no defensive positions. The British forces are mainly targeting Barce (the eastern terminus of the Benghazi railway) for the future. Although Apollonia, near Cyrenaica, was not mentioned in the British communique, Italian forces are believed to have abandoned the area. Italian forces in Eritrea, fleeing southeast towards Barentu, are in a state of collapse, abandoning various military supplies in their eagerness to reach the highway between Asmara and Addis Ababa. In Abyssinia, British forces are pursuing a column of Italian forces retreating towards Dahr, north of Lake Tana. Although the Italian forces are employing delaying tactics, the British forces are continuing to advance. Another British force, pursuing Italian forces retreating towards the Red Sea south of the Eritrean railway, has so far captured 1,500 enemy soldiers, mostly whites. The enemy forces have abandoned a large amount of materials. After swiftly occupying Barentu last week, mechanized British forces from Sudan are continuing to pursue the Italian forces. British forces near the Abyssinian border have seized a large number of Italian mechanized transport vehicles, some in perfect condition. British forces are also maintaining contact with patriotic Abyssinian forces in the railway area in northwestern Abyssinia. The enemy has planted landmines along the ninety-mile highway leading to Gedaref in Sudan, but the British mobile forces in the area are still making satisfactory progress. A British command communique stated that, to date, 400 Italian soldiers who have become separated from their units have been captured. British forces in the Eritrean region are currently engaged in military operations to attack Keren, which are proving quite successful. British forces from South Africa, who have entered southern Abyssinia, are currently consolidating their captured positions. British patrols in Italian Somaliland are continuing to operate in various areas, including an attack on an enemy outpost forty-five miles inside the border of that area. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Nairobi: A communique last night stated that a large patrol of British African troops had captured the Italian-fortified Beers Geogani sentinel post within the border of Italian Somaliland and is in pursuit. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>British Air Force Assists in Operations</p>
<p>Cairo: British Air Force bombers repeatedly attacked Barce, Dukabania, and the Italian lines of communication to Benghazi within Libya on Sunday. Italian motor transport units between Maraua and Barce were also heavily bombed, causing severe damage. The Barce railway station was attacked, with three bombs hitting the tracks, and the hangar at the Berka airfield was also hit. Benina was bombed and caught fire. A British Air Force communique from the Middle East stated that British fighters shot down two Italian planes and destroyed one enemy seaplane and one bomber. Furthermore, a squadron of South African Air Force fighters assisted the army in its offensive in Eritrea, attacking enemy airfields and setting five Italian planes on fire with their bombs. The squadron also engaged enemy aircraft in the Asmara area, shooting down one enemy plane. At least one enemy plane was also destroyed on the ground. British planes also attacked several military targets and motor transport units in Eritrea. The British planes suffered no losses. The South African Air Force continued to assist the army in operations in southern Abyssinia, with one fighter alone shooting down three Italian planes. On Tuesday, enemy planes attacked Malta and were intercepted by British fighters. At least three Italian planes were shot down and several were severely damaged. Houses suffered minor damage. All the British planes that went into action, except for one bomber and one fighter, returned safely. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Cairo: On Tuesday evening, planes from the British Air Force Middle East Command heavily bombed the Maliza airfield in the Italian Dodecanese Islands, with several bombs hitting the airfield and starting large fires. Furthermore, British air forces assisted the offensive of British forces on all five fronts in Africa. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Italy Sends Envoy to Negotiate with Britain: Evacuation of Nationals from East Africa; Meeting Place to be in a Neutral Country</h3>
<p>London: The Daily Telegraph reported that, because Italy's Abyssinian empire is being invaded by Britain and internally threatened by patriotic elements, Mussolini sent Count Volpi, his former Finance Minister, last night to negotiate with Britain the evacuation of approximately 100,000 Italian immigrants. This is the first clear indication that Rome recognizes the situation in Italian East Africa is completely hopeless. According to a visitor from a neutral country in Vichy who relayed news from New York, reliable sources claim that Count Volpi arrived here last weekend to negotiate the evacuation of Italians who have immigrated to Abyssinia since 1935. The Spanish ambassador to Vichy, Li Guili Jia (likely a transcription error from Spanish diplomat José Lequerica Erquiza, 李奎里加), is said to have been introduced by the Vichy authorities to act as a mediator for the Italian government. As a result of Count Volpi's mission, the French government has requested the French manager of the Franco-Ethiopian Railway Bureau between Addis Ababa and Djibouti to resume traffic on the line, which has been suspended since Italy entered the war last June. All rails destroyed by British air raids will be repaired as quickly as possible. Mr. Volpi had lunch with a high-ranking French official last Saturday, and it is believed that they discussed the issue of using the railway to evacuate Italian refugees. Mr. Volpi's talent for negotiating economic and political matters is generally recognized, and it is now believed that his negotiations with Britain will take place in a neutral country, either Spain or Portugal.

<h3>Smallest Nation in Europe Celebrates Independence Anniversary</h3>
<p>San Marino: San Marino, the oldest and smallest republic in Europe, celebrated its 201st anniversary of independence yesterday. This republic, located in the heart of the Italian peninsula and covering only thirty-eight square miles, was founded in the fourth century by a stonemason named Marinus, during the persecution of Christians by Emperor Diocletian. Napoleon I recognized its independence when he conquered Italy. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>British Fleet Sails into the Mediterranean Again: Undertaking Important Mission</h3>
<p>London: A special correspondent from a warship in the central Mediterranean British fleet reported that the powerful British Eastern Mediterranean Fleet, unafraid of the new threat from the sky, has sailed into the sea again, determined to eliminate German and Italian planes. The enemy's aerial challenge has failed to hinder the British fleet. Several British ships have undertaken important missions in the central Mediterranean, while light fleets are continuously assisting in the fighting along the Libyan coast. The British fleet has been underway for four days and is well within enemy aircraft range, but no enemy planes have yet appeared. One enemy reconnaissance plane was sighted some days ago, and it is believed that the plane must have reported the British fleet's location, so all members of the fleet are on alert for battle. However, the lack of enemy aircraft sightings is somewhat disappointing but increases the British confidence in controlling the Mediterranean. The British fleet has been sailing for several days without incident, encountering only a few mines, which were avoided by changing course. British fighter planes are soaring freely in the sky. The British fleet will soon return to base for a brief rest. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Germany Is Rushing to Build Aircraft: Attempt to Invade England</h3>
<p>Washington: Government sources revealed yesterday that Germany is using the material and human resources of the countries it has conquered to accelerate the construction of submarines, warships, and new fighter planes in an attempt to invade England. Officials stated that Germany's failure to increase arms production indicates that its armaments are already sufficient, but it lacks a full complement of the latest first-line aircraft. As for its increased submarine production, it is attempting to cut off Britain's lifeline, namely, Britain's maritime transport. (International News Service dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>After Darlan's Return to Vichy, Franco-German Relations Have Not Been Fully Resolved; Hitler Aims to Utilize the French Fleet; French Cabinet Holds Meeting to Discuss Response</h3>
<p>London: According to the Independent French Press Agency, receiving news from the French border, Hitler has notified Vichy that the Franco-German problem must be fully and fundamentally resolved and implemented within this month. It is said that the Vichy government is still trying to delay, giving no clear answer, but this decision by the German side seems to be a letter of ultimatum. Regarding the French cabinet meeting, nothing was heard yesterday. The Toulon radio station only stated that the cabinet meeting was "very important." According to Swiss radio, informed sources in Vichy said that Naval Minister Darlan may return to Paris this morning. While the Vichy cabinet was meeting to hear Darlan's report, the German side was exerting pressure by broadcasting from the Stuttgart radio station. A German broadcaster from the station, speaking in French, expressed pessimism about the chances of promoting understanding between Vichy and Berlin. It was claimed, "If the current situation remains unchanged or worsens, Germany will have to take precautions." The implication is that the German side may impose the harshest conditions on France. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German official news agency stated that a communique issued after the French cabinet meeting yesterday stated that the French cabinet met for two hours yesterday under the chairmanship of General Petain. Admiral Darlan reported on his talks in Paris in recent days. Cabinet members then considered general policies. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>London: According to Lyon radio, Vichy Naval Minister Darlan reported on his talks in Paris at a cabinet meeting convened by General Petain yesterday afternoon. The cabinet meeting is still in progress. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington: According to information received by well-informed diplomatic sources here, Laval lost his position in the Petain cabinet last December because he agreed with the German side to allow them to use the French fleet and occupy the port of Bizerte in Tunis, French Africa. Now that Laval has been reinstated, Berlin will demand the fulfillment of this agreement, but General Petain is unwilling to agree. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Vichy: Naval Minister Admiral Darlan, after conducting negotiations with the German authorities in Paris, returned here yesterday and immediately reported to Marshal Petain on the course of the trip. Marshal Petain then convened a State Council at 4:30 PM today to discuss it, lasting for two hours. What kind of developments will occur in the negotiations between the French and German authorities will depend on the outcome of this meeting. Admiral Darlan will likely carry new instructions and make another trip to Paris. According to responsible sources here, new developments may occur in the situation, and they will be dealt with accordingly. As for rumors of an imminent cabinet reshuffle, they should not be easily believed. What can be said at the moment is that after the meeting between Marshal Petain and former cabinet member Laval, the misunderstandings between the two sides for a month have been happily resolved in the spirit of unity and are bound to produce significant results. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The organ of the German authorities in Alsace, the "Strasbourg News," commented critically on French domestic politics today, stating, "Since France signed the armistice agreement, Franco-German relations have been normal, but only as a transitional period, that is, only until Laval was dismissed in mid-December of last year. [Laval] was the first French politician to recognize that Franco-German cooperation was a new path for France. Paris believes that Vichy's current policy will be of no benefit to France. Vichy has gradually returned to its old policies, and its attitude is confused, which will inevitably result in the loss of the opportunity to cooperate with its eastern neighbor. France's wait-and-see policy will cause France greater losses than war. Germany does not want to interfere in the domestic politics of other countries, but Laval's expulsion has affected Franco-German relations." (Haitong Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Vichy: Last night, while the French cabinet was meeting, hundreds of reporters from various countries waited in the corridors of the Parc Hotel for the cabinet's resolution. According to well-informed sources, Laval did not put forward conditions, but only made suggestions. It is expected that when Naval Minister Darlan goes to Paris again, Laval's suggestions will be brought up for discussion again. What is being discussed here is whether Laval's power when he returns to Vichy will be greater than before December 12th. What kind of results will Vichy's response to Paris produce? (Haitong Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Vichy: The French State Council met yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, with General Petain presiding. Key government officials all participated. It is believed that Naval Minister Admiral Darlan has reported on his meetings with German Ambassador to France Abetz and former French Foreign Minister Laval. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 6th) Vichy, according to well-informed sources,</p>
<p>French Naval Minister Admiral Darlan, after reporting to General Petain on the negotiations in Paris, may travel to Paris again today. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Berlin: A German official spokesperson stated to foreign reporters yesterday that he was not at liberty to comment on the rumors of a relaxation of tensions between General Petain and Laval. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Vichy: French Naval Minister Darlan left Vichy this morning at 10:00 AM for Paris and will return here on the 8th. Therefore, all important political issues will be decided after his return here. Political figures here are paying close attention to the fact that U.S. Ambassador Leahy repeatedly visited General Petain while Darlan was preparing to go to Paris. In recent days, the U.S. ambassador has been very active. It is rumored that Leahy's purpose in visiting General Petain was to inquire about the instructions that Darlan was taking to Paris. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Vichy: French political figures generally believe that General Petain will decide on France's policy within a week, or he may decide as soon as Darlan returns to Vichy from Paris. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>German Ambassador Arrives in Sofia: Further Demands Made; Joining the Axis to Allow Passage to Attack Greece; Soviet Attitude Deserves Attention</h3>
<p>London: According to reliable sources received here yesterday, Colonel Tragonaev, the Bulgarian ambassador to Berlin, has arrived in Sofia, carrying a renewed German invitation for Bulgaria to join the Axis alliance. Well-informed circles say that Bulgaria may accept it, after which Germany will invade Greece through Bulgaria. Authoritative sources believe that Germany will use the stationing of Royal Air Force squadrons in Salonika as a pretext for action against Greece. It is highly doubtful whether the Soviet Union will take action if Germany openly invades Bulgaria. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Sofia: The Bulgarian King met with the outgoing Minister of Agriculture, Bagrianov, yesterday. Rumors are circulating that the King will appoint Bagrianov to form a new cabinet, but this has not been confirmed. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Istanbul: After the Soviet official news agency denied the rumors that the Soviet-Turkish mixed (likely referring to a joint Soviet-Turkish) and Turkish arms purchasing delegation had arrived in the Soviet Union, it broke the silence. This calm state has been seen by the Turkish side as a sign of disagreement between Germany and the Soviet Union regarding Balkan policies. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Sofia: The Bulgarian Parliament passed a resolution yesterday, with a majority vote, supporting the policy adopted by the government, after listening to Prime Minister Filov's statement regarding the resignation of the Minister of Agriculture. Many deputies made speeches. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>London: A diplomatic correspondent for the News Chronicle stated that Germany's diplomatic and military preparations for invading Bulgaria are now actively underway and show signs of occurring at any moment. If German troops enter Bulgaria, Britain will have another active ally, because Turkey has made it clear that such action will not be tolerated. London naturally hopes that Bulgaria will resist Germany's attempts to enslave the country, but the basis for this hope is not very solid. With Romania and Greece as examples, Bulgaria will be able to choose its own destiny. The correspondent also stated that, no matter which path Bulgaria chooses, it is almost certain that its territory will become a battlefield, or perhaps the place where the outcome of the war is decided.

<h3>Czechs Hide Food Supplies: Resisting Germany</h3>
<p>London: According to news received here, the German agricultural manager in Prague reported to Berlin that there was large-scale sabotage of food supplies in the Czech Republic. He stated that 250,000 pigs and many cattle and sheep were secretly slaughtered by civilians last year. At least 300,000 tons of meat were not transported to Germany, and 13,000 carloads of grain were hidden. An order to search houses for food has not yet been issued, for fear that civilians will panic and destroy even more food privately. New disciplinary measures have now been issued to prevent sabotage, with the lightest punishment being a fine and six months in prison. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Amidst Flying Snow, British Aircraft Attack the French Coast: Calais and Boulogne Bombed</h3>
<p>London: The Air Ministry announced that although enemy aircraft activity was slight off the eastern and southeastern coasts of Britain yesterday, very few enemy planes penetrated inland. Bombs fell in one area in northeastern Scotland and one location in Kent, but there was no damage or casualties. Yesterday morning, British fighter planes shot down an enemy bomber. Last night, sirens sounded again in London, followed by heavy artillery fire. It was reported that a batch of incendiary bombs was dropped in a certain district of London, mostly landing in open spaces, causing minimal damage. In another district, two bombs damaged several roof beams. It was also reported that bombs fell in a southeastern location. Before noon, the sirens were lifted. According to the Air Ministry, the Royal Air Force was very active yesterday over the English Channel and northern France. Fighter planes continued to patrol, shooting down an enemy bomber over the Channel in the morning and another enemy plane in the afternoon. In the afternoon, a squadron of British bombers, escorted by a large group of fighter planes, flew over northern France and bombed the Saint-Omer airfield with considerable success, also shooting down two enemy planes in aerial combat. Five British fighter planes were missing. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>London: A large squadron of British bombers, escorted by fighter planes, heavily bombed the snow-covered French coast yesterday. They returned in close formation, flying over the Strait of Dover at an altitude of five thousand feet. This was the second daylight raid in four days. After a flurry of snow at dawn over the Strait, the weather was quite clear. (The German government's news agency claimed that seventeen British planes were shot down in the raid on the Channel coast, two of which were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. There were no German losses.) At the same time, German planes also attacked southeastern and northeastern England. A night fighter shot down a German Heinkel aircraft near Margate, killing all crew members. (Tashun News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>London: After the Royal Air Force heavily damaged the German invasion springboard the previous night, they bombed German bases on the French coast again last night. From Calais to Boulogne, red flames shot up everywhere, and the ground was ablaze. Despite fierce German resistance, dozens of British planes dropped countless tons of bombs on German bases. Flames and smoke columns rose nine thousand feet, penetrating the skies above Calais, Boulogne, Bordeaux, Ostend, and other German-occupied coastal cities. As British planes attacked over eight hundred miles of the Franco-Belgian coastline, fierce aerial combat broke out over the English Channel. The British claimed that seven German planes were shot down during the day, with five British planes missing. Furthermore, the work of the citizens after the Tuesday night raid has now ended. The Tuesday raid was the most intense in weeks. Several squadrons of German planes crossed eastern Midland, dropping bombs on a certain town and other parts of Midland. It was also reported that bombs fell in northwestern England, killing three people and destroying one house. (International News Agency, 6th)</p>

The French Ambassador to Japan and the Vietnamese Chief Representative, Prince Vara Vara Novo, jointly met with Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka and special envoy Matsumiya for talks that lasted some time. (Haito News Agency, 6th)</p>

<p>Bangkok: Today, a government spokesman told a Reuters reporter that the "radio war" between Bangkok and Saigon, which had been temporarily suspended after the signing of the truce agreement, has now resumed. The spokesman asserted that Saigon has restarted it, leaving Bangkok with no other option but to retaliate with the same measures. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Vichy: The armistice agreement between Thailand and French Vietnam, mediated by the Japanese government, has been commented on by responsible officials here, stating briefly that the demarcation line of this agreement slightly encroaches upon Vietnamese territory, namely: (1) To the north of the protruding part of Thailand, this line is west of Yue Zeng City, the capital of Laos, encroaching into Vietnamese territory to the right bank of the Mekong River. (2) To the east of the protruding part of Thailand, it passes west of the Bak Su District, through Bassac Province, but does not reach the Mekong River. (3) To the south of the protruding part of Thailand, it passes north of Samrong City in Cambodia and west of Sisophon Town. The area between the Thai border and this demarcation line is designated as a "no-man's land" pending a final resolution. Thailand claims that Vietnamese troops have repeatedly violated the agreement and invaded this area. Foreign news agencies have also reported that Japanese troops have been permitted to land in Saigon to ensure compliance with the agreement by both Thailand and Vietnam. These are not true. In short, regarding the landing of Japanese troops in Saigon, the Vietnamese authorities have neither received a request from the Japanese side nor have they granted permission. The armistice agreement also does not contain such provisions. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>After Lord Lloyd's Death, No One in Charge of the House of Lords, Successor Being Sought</h3>
<p>London: Following the death of Colonial Secretary Lord Lloyd, the question of succession is quite complex, as Lord Lloyd was not only the Colonial Secretary but also the Leader of the House of Lords. Among the current members of the House of Lords who are also state ministers, only Dominion Secretary Lord Cranborne is a newcomer to the cabinet. Some suggest that Lord Hailey, the current Civil Defense Commissioner, should hold both positions. At the same time, others say that the Duke of Devonshire could be Lord Lloyd's successor. According to the British Constitution, the House of Lords must have two state ministers, so the current vacancy must be filled with a member of the nobility. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>British Blockade Policy Criticized by Spain</h3>
<p>Madrid: The Spanish newspaper Arriba today published an article, threateningly criticizing the British blockade and "those who seek to paralyze Spain at home and abroad." It claimed that the Spanish people have lived peacefully since the end of a bloody war and have forgiven the enemies who have hindered their progress. But from now on, we must unite and be vigilant under the national flag. If we want to improve the situation at home and abroad and prevent Spain from becoming a desolate land inhabited by the last starving people of a formerly warlike nation, then we must replace words with action and prudent defense with an aggressive offensive. The time has now come. In recent days, newspaper editorials and speeches have constantly cited the blockade as one of the causes of the current food shortage in Spain. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

<h3>Philippe Receives Reporters, Discusses Municipal Measures and Views, Welcomes Opinions on Tax Issues, Police Agreement Seeks Resident Welfare</h3>
<p>Yesterday (6th) afternoon at 3:00 PM, Philippe, Director-General of the Public Works Department and Director-General of Municipal Affairs, received Chinese and foreign reporters at the Bureau, expressing his views on municipal measures. He stated, in brief, that he was very pleased to have everyone present at the Bureau today, and would like to share his opinions on several municipal measures that are of public concern:</p>
<p>Committee Selection for Tax Research</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of tax fairness, much has been said recently. The Bureau has organized a committee to study this issue. The committee members are Mr. Fessenden, Mr. Jones, Mr. Mayhan, Mr. Okamoto, and Mr. Sun Ruihuan. Some people may raise questions, saying that three of the committee members have overly close ties with the Bureau. Such criticisms may occur, so I would like to take this opportunity to explain why we organized this committee and selected experts familiar with the Bureau's affairs to serve as members. The task of this committee is not easy, and their work must be expedited so that their report can be submitted to the foreign taxpayers' conference to be held in April this year. Therefore, the Bureau believes that those who undertake this work must fully understand the Bureau's current system and the principles and practices of taxation and be able to start work immediately to be effective. Mr. Jones has served as Director-General of the Bureau and is familiar with British tax law (the Bureau's taxation system is based on this law). Mr. Fessenden and Mr. Okamoto not only understand the Bureau's situation but also have legal knowledge of the customs of various countries. Mr. Mayhan has studied this issue extensively and has many opinions. Mr. Sun Ruihuan is the Deputy Manager of the New China Bank and has rich experience.</p>
<p>Humbly Adopt Opinions from All Sides</p>
<p>Please do not think that after the establishment of this committee, individual citizens will have no opportunity to express their opinions. We welcome all groups who wish to present their views to the committee, and taxpayers who wish to express their opinions on the tax system individually are also welcome. Please do not think that the Bureau hopes that the committee will only endorse the current system. The Bureau is well aware that there are unfair aspects of the current tax system and has repeatedly tried to find ways to remedy them. It would be a great thing if the committee could plan to eliminate the causes of inequality and place the tax system on a more equitable basis.</p>
<p>Reconsideration of Taxation Authority</p>
<p>I would now like to state something about several other matters. Some people believe that the Bureau should implement a completely new tax system. Although I do not want people to think that I am opposed to this view, I hope that you will consider several obstacles. For many years, the Bureau's lawyers have stated that the Bureau's taxation power is limited to dock dues, license fees, land tax, and house tax. The Bureau is prepared to ask for reconsideration of the expansion of the Bureau's taxation authority, but it should be noted that any tax or fee that cannot be implemented in court cannot be effective. Therefore, the taxes you pay should be a legal obligation recognized by the Public Concession Court. This is why the Bureau cannot exceed the provisions of the land contract.</p>
<p>New Tax System Difficult to Implement</p>
<p>Leaving aside these legal difficulties, please try to examine the proposed new tax system. Many people now believe that the Bureau should levy taxes on business profits. However, this is very difficult in Shanghai, and unless individuals pay taxes according to the same standard, this tax system is unfair. Consider how difficult it would be to calculate the true income and profits of individual citizens of different nationalities and businesses. If we want to implement it, the Bureau must hire a large number of investigators, auditors, and accountants, and the results of the investigation may not be reliable. Moreover, the Bureau does not have the authority to inspect business books.</p>
<p>Stock Exchange Tax Difficult to Sustain</p>
<p>Some may think that the Bureau can levy taxes on the stock exchange or other exchanges. Regarding this, I do not want to be misunderstood. The Bureau believes that it would be pleased to obtain any substantial income from the stock exchange or similar businesses, whether through voluntary donations or compulsory collection. But can we count on this tax revenue to meet the Bureau's regular expenses? When the stock exchange is booming, it is hoped that a considerable income can be obtained from taxation, but when its business declines, there will be no tax revenue. I therefore advocate that such taxes, if they can be collected, should be used for extraordinary and additional expenses.</p>
<p>Establishing a Quiet Power Agreement Aims to Maintain Order</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the recently established Shanghai West Police Agreement, this agreement is the result of several months of operation and is believed to be able to answer the outside world's comments on the Bureau. Some want the Bureau to take so-called direct action against the evils in the west, but if the Bureau implements direct action in areas where jurisdiction is still in dispute, the hope of establishing an agreement to restore order in the west may not be realized. I have also paid attention to comments of a completely different nature. Some have criticized the Bureau for negotiating with those whom they call "actual" officials. The Bureau is not involved in any form of politics. What the Bureau wants to do is to maintain normalcy for hundreds of thousands of Chinese and millions of foreigners in Shanghai. Anyone who can assist the Bureau in achieving this goal, the Bureau is prepared to contact them. Some have criticized the Bureau for demanding too much in the west. My answer is that the Bureau's only purpose is to do its best to fulfill its obligations to those who live on the roads outside the boundary, so that they can enjoy the benefits of the Bureau's services.</p>
<h3>The Board of Directors of the Bureau Suggests to the Consular Body the Date for the Election of Directors, and Will Schedule the Annual Taxpayers' Meeting, the Number of Directors of the Bureau Can Continue to Be Maintained</h3>
<p>The aftermath of a verbal battle at the special meeting of foreign taxpayers in the Public Concession has not yet ended, and the preliminary action of another important struggle concerning the affairs of the Public Concession was launched yesterday (6th). The Bureau of Public Works has submitted the date of the Bureau's annual election of directors to the Shanghai Consular Body for approval, and holding the Annual Taxpayers' Meeting on April 16th is also under consideration.</p>
<p>Proposed Date for Election of Directors</p>
<p>According to responsible sources, the Bureau of Public Works has suggested that April 2nd and 3rd are appropriate dates for the election of the nine directors who will manage the affairs of the Public Concession in the next term. It is hoped that this request will be approved by the Consular Body within a few days. Upon receiving the Consular Body's reply on this issue, the Bureau will likely submit a request for the Annual Taxpayers' Meeting. The Bureau is currently studying April 10th as the best date for this meeting.</p>
<p>American Association Meeting Today</p>
<p>As for the proposed amendments to the election method proposed by the Japanese taxpayers during last year's election, no details are yet available. It is generally felt that unless some new methods are adopted before the next meeting of the Bureau of Public Works, the important results of the election will not change. According to news yesterday, the Executive Committee of the American Association of this city will meet today (7th). It is generally believed that the Association will nominate candidates in advance for the American director of the Bureau of Public Works. The usual procedure requires sufficient time for the American community to recommend other candidates, and then decide on the final American director candidates to be recommended.</p>
<p>Ratio of Number Can Still Be Maintained</p>
<p>It is heard that the Japanese Taxpayers Association has not yet decided on the date for nominating Japanese director candidates, but it is expected that the Association will do so soon. The Japanese side has not indicated today how many Japanese director candidates it will recommend, but it is generally expected that there will be at least five candidates, as in previous years. Based on the current number of votes of taxpayers in the Public Concession, the current situation of seven Western directors and two Japanese directors can continue to be maintained, as the current number of votes of Westerners is more than three times that of the Japanese. It is generally expected that Japanese taxpayers will soon take action to change the current election system and the procedures of the Taxpayers' Annual Meeting in the Public Concession.</p>
<h3>Reactions to the Passage of the Additional Tax Bill, the Difficult Situation of the Chinese Who Endure Pain Temporarily, the Japanese Indicate They Will Pay Taxes According to the New Regulations, the Bureau of Public Works Establishes a Committee to Study the Tax System</h3>
<p>The special meeting of foreign taxpayers convened by the Bureau of Public Works of the Public Concession to discuss the additional tax bill has caused unprecedented serious disputes. Now the additional tax bill has finally been passed at the reconvened meeting, but the Chinese, who account for the largest number of taxpayers and the highest tax amount in the Public Concession, have no say in the additional tax bill at all. This unfair fact is deeply imprinted on the hearts of every Chinese. The general view of the Chinese is that at a time when the country is striving for overall revival, everyone should embrace the attitude of sacrificing the ego for the greater good. Therefore, they are extremely silent about the passage of the additional tax at the Taxpayers' Special Meeting and endure temporary pain to wait for the return of light.</p>
<p>Establish a Committee to Study the Tax System</p>
<p>The Bureau of Public Works, in accordance with the Director-General's statement at the Taxpayers' Special Meeting, has established a committee to study the current tax system, addressing the unfairness between owner-occupied properties and rented properties, and seeking ways to remedy it. The committee members are Mr. Sun Ruihuan, Mr. Fessenden, Mr. Jones, Mr. Mayhan, and Mr. Okamoto. The secretary is Mr. Gray. All public groups and taxpayers are welcome to submit their opinions to the committee. Letters should be sent to Mr. Gray at the Bureau of Public Works Director-General's Office.</p>
<p>The Burden on Residents Will Be Further Increased</p>
<p>The English-language Ta Mei Evening News stated that after the special meeting of foreign taxpayers in the Public Concession passed the resolution on the Bureau of Public Works' additional taxes and license fees yesterday (5th), there are many small taxpayers in the Public Concession today (6th) who are dissatisfied. In addition, the general public's reaction to the additional tax this morning is still good, with few continuing to criticize it, and they recognize this as an unavoidable step, as the Bureau of Public Works urgently needs more funds. Many taxpayers believe that the passage of the additional tax at yesterday's special meeting may lead to a continued increase in rents, which will further increase the burden on the residents of the Public Concession.</p>
<p>Japanese Will Pay Taxes According to the New Regulations</p>
<p>The Japanese taxpayers have opposed the additional tax bill from the beginning. It was rumored some time ago that if the additional tax bill was passed by the Taxpayers' Special Meeting, the Japanese intended to establish a sub-district in the northern district of the Concession and separate from the Bureau of Public Works. However, this statement has been denied by the Japanese side, claiming that this is unfounded. It is generally believed that Japanese taxpayers are considering paying taxes according to the new tax rate. However, according to the Japanese, Japanese taxpayers will still abide by the resolution of the previous Foreign Taxpayers' Special Meeting and pay taxes according to the new regulations. However, what will happen remains to be seen.</p>
<h3>The Deputy Director-General of the Bureau of Public Works Will Be Succeeded by Mitchell</h3>
<p>The current Deputy Director-General of the Bureau of Public Works, Mr. Kennett, is about to leave Shanghai. The Board of Directors of the Bureau has now appointed Mr. Mitchell to succeed him in this position. The directors have praised Mr. Kennett's contributions.</p>
<h3>Improving the Rice Market: Municipal Council Proposes Suggestions to Prevent Hoarding, Speculation, and Manipulation; Rumors of Vietnamese Rice Shipments to Japan Proven False</h3>
<p>To prevent hoarding, speculation, and profiteering in grains, the Municipal Council has approved the Grain Committee's recommendations and submitted the following measures to the Rice Market Management Committee for implementation:</p>
<p>Seven Measures</p>
<p>(1) All wholesale rice merchants should be automatic members of the rice market. (2) Reliable rice brokers should be registered and required to provide adequate guarantees, which must be deemed satisfactory by the Rice Trade Association. (3) Rice merchants should clearly record the sold rice in books or invoices. For each completed transaction, three copies of the sales slip should be prepared: one for the buyer, one for the market manager, and one for the seller. These slips must specify the price, quantity, quality, and the names and addresses of both parties. The Municipal Council may dispatch personnel to inspect all books, invoices, and sales slips at any time. (4) All wholesale transactions in the city should be concentrated in the rice market. The current practice of purchasing at least ten bags per transaction should be maintained. A deposit of five yuan per bag should be paid upon completion of the transaction, and delivery should be made within five days; otherwise, the deposit will be forfeited. (5) The practice of publicly announcing daily rice prices should be strictly enforced. (6) Up-to-date statistics should be maintained on futures purchases, rice arrivals, inventory levels, and the location of stored rice. (7) Trading in rice that has not yet arrived should be limited to reliable wholesale rice merchants.</p>
<p>Continued Sales at Fixed Prices</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Fixed-Price Rice Committee began selling Saigon broken rice at fixed prices, it has greatly benefited the common people and contributed significantly to addressing the city's overall food supply issue. The eighth phase of fixed-price sales concluded on January 19. This reporter learned from the committee yesterday that it has decided to continue the ninth phase of broken rice sales at fixed prices in accordance with the authorities' intentions. Recently, foreign rice has been flooding into the city, and inventories are growing, with rice prices expected to fall. However, ordinary people still lack the means to purchase it, so preparations are underway for the ninth phase of fixed-price rice sales. A meeting will be convened in the next few days to discuss specific measures before a date is set.</p>
<p>Vietnamese Rice Prices Unchanged</p>
<p>Rumors in the rice market have now been proven false. The Shanghai rice industry received a telegram from its counterparts in Saigon yesterday reporting that the Vietnamese authorities had previously agreed to transfer 80,000 tons of glutinous rice to Japan at the request of the Japanese side, but this sale has now been canceled. Therefore, negotiations were initiated with the Vietnamese authorities. Furthermore, a certain rice firm also received a telegram from its counterpart in Hong Kong, stating that rice prices there were unaffected by the current situation and remained stable. Shanghai rice merchants were relieved by this good news and now hold their goods, fearing unexpected losses, and have begun to release them gradually at the newly set price limits. The sudden increase in available spot goods has improved the rice market this morning, and sentiment is weakening. It is truly regrettable that Shanghai's rice prices rely on rumors. The city's food reserves are not small, totaling over one million bags. Meanwhile, the supply of foreign rice continues steadily, and the authorities of the two settlements are actively working to clear the way for the shipment of domestic rice to Shanghai. However, speculators are still ready to seize opportunities, which is truly disheartening.</p>
<h3>US Authorities State: No Withdrawal of Defense Forces from Shanghai; Rumor Offensive Originates from Germany and Japan to Obstruct Passage of Aid to Democratic China Act</h3>
<p>According to the *Millard's Review*, which will be published tomorrow, rumors circulated in Shanghai last weekend that all American expatriates in the Far East would soon be evacuated. However, responsible American authorities stated that these reports were completely unfounded. The US authorities in China had previously issued an advisory to American expatriates in the Far East without essential business to evacuate, but there was no order to evacuate the US Marines, nor was there a deadline for all American expatriates to leave China within 30 days. Moreover, investigations by reporters have revealed that these rumors were spread by the Japanese and Nazis on Wednesday and Thursday to sway American public opinion against the passage of the Aid to Democratic China Act. This rumor offensive is not limited to Shanghai; Shanghai is being used as a transmission point.</p>

<h3>Japanese Newspaper Severely Criticizes Shooting and Arson Incidents; Believes It Will Lead to Disdain and Contempt; Actions of Lin Xiongji and Others Cannot Be Approved</h3>
<p>The *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reported that this morning (the 6th), the Japanese-language *Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun* published an editorial sharply criticizing the illegal actions taken by Japanese residents in Shanghai, such as Lin Xiongji shooting Ke Zaiwei and two Japanese attempting to burn down the bamboo shed at the ratepayers' special meeting venue. It stated that while the actions of Morinaga Matsunosuke and Kubo Moriakira in attempting to burn down the bamboo shed "may be worthy of sympathy" subjectively, they were illegal objectively. The future development of the International Settlement "may stimulate our nerves and sense of justice," but Japanese should avoid any action that invites disdain and contempt. In the past, there have been cases where Japanese actions with misguided motives have put the Japanese government in a difficult position, and this has happened more than once. Japanese may understand the actions of these Japanese, but foreigners are different from Japanese in many ways and cannot be expected to have the same reactions. The newspaper concluded, "We are no longer Japanese on islands, but Japanese in East Asia or the world. This point cannot be forgotten. We sympathize with Lin Xiongji, who is currently being questioned for shooting Ke Zaiwei, and with the two who attempted to burn down the bamboo shed, but we cannot approve of their actions."</p>
<h3>Special Court Heavily Guarded; Breach in Qipu Road Still Blocked</h3>
<p>The breach in Qipu Road remains blocked. The Shanghai Municipal Council closed Qipu Road between North Zhejiang Road and Gansu Road yesterday evening to protect the First Special District Court and the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. At that time, a gap was left open at Gansu Road, but it was not opened from yesterday onwards, as the road is now devoid of residents. Meanwhile, US troops are stationed in the courthouse day and night, and Chinese and Indian constables guard the ends of the barbed wire fence. During court sessions, judicial police guard the courtroom, while patrols and troops protect the outside. The Weihaiwei Road branch office is also under similar guard, so the security situation is becoming increasingly tight.</p>
<h3>Greek Community Commemorates Former Greek Prime Minister</h3>

Greeks around the world held ceremonies yesterday to commemorate the late Prime Minister. Metaxas passed away a week ago after undergoing surgery for a throat ailment.</p>
<h3>Commercial Ship Traffic for the Entire Last Year</h3>
<p>Shanghai is the center of China's trade and the only major port in the Far East. Foreign shipping to China still occupies the most important position. In the 29th year of the Republic of China, a total of 3,750 commercial ships, totaling 12,091,167 tons, accounted for nearly 50% of the country's total, more than four times that of the Tianjin Customs.

<h3>After the Establishment of the "Police Power Agreement," Gambling Dens Are Relocating; Six Nations Hotel Plans to Move to the Old Site of Little World; Nanshi Is Likely to Become a Den of Vice</h3>
<p>The Da Guang News Agency reports that since the "Police Power Agreement" for the Shanghai Western Extra-Settlement Road Area was signed on the 1st of this month, there is a special annex to the "Agreement" stipulating that illegal businesses will not be allowed to exist within the area. It is rumored that the "Shanghai Western Special Police Department" will first order them to cease operations when it is established, and they will be shut down if they attempt to reopen in the future. The gambling dens in the Western District have now received notice from a certain party and are preparing to relocate to continue operating. The Six Nations Hotel at 346 Avenue Haig, the largest of these, has recently added new buildings to expand its facilities. Due to the pressure of the environment, it has chosen the old site of Little World on Fuyou Road in Nanshi to continue gambling operations and is currently sending workers to actively renovate it. Other gambling dens in the Dihua Road and Yuyuan Road areas are also moving to Nanshi and are currently looking for suitable premises. It is noted that gambling and opium dens are already rampant in Nanshi, so they will become even more rampant in the future. This second "bad land" is likely to become a den of vice.</p>
<h3>Bomb Explodes at the Rising Sun Building</h3>

<h3>Major Landlord Conspires with Three Subtenants to Sue the Second Tenant for Eviction; Court Investigates and Rules Against the Major Landlord</h3>
<p>Egg merchant Dai Huiquin leased three shop houses (namely, 624, 626, and 628 Tiantong Road) and a residential unit at number nine in the alley from the Hexing Real Estate Company, which was constructing a number of residences and shop houses at 612 Tiantong Road before August 13, for a brokerage fee of 3,600 yuan, intending to open the Xingtai Egg Store.</p>
<p>The construction of the houses had not been completed when the Shanghai War broke out. They were only completed on February 1, 1938. At that time, Dai used 628 shop houses to open an egg store due to the economic downturn, and sublet 624 and 626 to Huang Kecheng to open a Standard Coal Briquette Company. Both opened when the houses were completed. Dai's lease with the major landlord was for an indefinite term, while the leases with the subtenants were for</p>
<p>Fixed-Term Leases</p>
<p>Initially, there was no objection from any party. Later, due to the shortage of houses and large population in Shanghai, rents soared. The Hexing Real Estate Company gave Dai several blank lease agreements and asked him to change to a fixed-term lease, which Dai refused. When the leases of the houses sublet by Huang Kecheng from Dai expired, Dai wanted to take them back for his own use to expand the egg store, but Huang did not agree. As a result of the lawsuit, Huang lost. The Hexing Company then came forward and sued for an</p>
<p>Eviction Order, arguing that the lease agreement signed by both parties was for a fixed term and had expired. As a result, the presiding judge ruled that the lease agreement submitted by the Hexing Company had been altered and ruled against the Hexing Company. The Hexing Company then filed another lawsuit with the Civil Court of the First Special District Court, arguing that Dai had sublet all the houses, violating the terms of the lease, and requested that Dai be ordered to relinquish possession. The first instance ruled against Dai because three subtenants testified.</p>
<p>Dai appealed to the Second Higher Court, arguing that the major landlord had colluded with the three subtenants to deceive the court. Recently, he hired Yan Yinwu as his lawyer. After hearing the case, the Second Higher Court ruled that there was reason for Dai's appeal and recently ruled against the Hexing Real Estate Company.</p>
<h3>Dance Hostess Lin Xiaomei Pregnant, Accuses a Patron of Rape; Defendant Does Not Deny the Relationship but Questions the Time and Place</h3>
<p>Lin Xiaomei (18 years old, from Shaoxing, also known as Ruyou), a dance hostess at the Metropolitan Dance Hall at 6 Wangdel Li, 6 Wangzhi Road, French Concession, accompanied by her mother, Lin Jinshi, filed a complaint with the Zhabei police accusing Yu Zhongyun (24 years old, from Taizhou), a former Soochow University student residing in room 503 of the New Asia Hotel on Guizhou Road, of rape. According to the accusation, she met Yu at the dance hall a year ago. In September, Yu lured her to rooms 503, 509, and 518 of the New Asia Hotel.</p>
<p>Consecutive rapes occurred six or seven times, and Lin's virginity was broken by Yu. At that time, Yu said that he would marry her, but now that she is about two months pregnant, Yu has abandoned her. Hua Detective Xue Youwen investigated and confirmed the facts. Yu was arrested and brought to the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Qian Xunji prosecuted him under Article 240, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code for obstructing family life. Lin Xiaomei, in her petition, stated that she did not wish to pursue the case. Questioned, Yu Zhongyun confessed that the</p>
<p>Relationship did occur, but the dates were in February of last year, and the last time was in June of last year. Therefore, it is questionable whether her two-month pregnancy is due to him. Because she was able to have a relationship with him, it is difficult to guarantee that she did not have the same facts with others. As for Lin Xiaomei's claim that her virginity was broken by him, it is also untrue, because my friend Wang, who is now in Hong Kong, had a physical relationship with Lin before me. Moreover, I have already married a wife and have children in my hometown, so how can I marry Lin as my wife? As for the location of the relationship,</p>
<p>It was not the New Asia Hotel, but the Paramount Ballroom and the Cangzhou Hotel. Police lawyer Qian argued that the article of the law cited by the police was not a complaint but a discussion, so even if the plaintiff does not wish to pursue the matter, it cannot be withdrawn according to the law and should be punished according to the law. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the testimony and declared the debate closed, postponing the sentencing for one week. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Zikawei Observatory issued a weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday, stating that the weather in Shandong is clear and cold, with strong northwest monsoon winds. In this area and south of Maanshan Island, the coastal weather is cloudy and cold, with strong northeast monsoon winds that will become stronger. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in the city was 51.4 degrees, and the lowest was 43.3 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest temperature was 42.4 degrees, and the lowest was 36.3 degrees.</p>

<h3>Food Grains; Rice Weevils are Spreading Rumors Again, Saying that Rice Transshipped from Hong Kong Will Encounter Difficulties; Rice Prices Rose Again in the Afternoon Due to Hoarding</h3>
<p>More foreign rice has arrived in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's *Ninghai* arrived yesterday afternoon with 1,298 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong and docked at the Bund Wharf in the French Concession to unload. The Jardine Matheson Company's *Taisheng* also arrived in Shanghai at approximately 1:00 PM yesterday with 393 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload. (Unconfirmed)</p>
<p>After foreign rice softened slightly in the early hours, the market in general stores stirred again yesterday morning, with sellers taking advantage of the situation to hoard goods and raise prices by about half a yuan. The special small batch opened at 82.8 yuan, and the small batch at 74.8 yuan. Eventually, due to the congestion of goods in the market, the price quickly eased. The momentum of the rise gradually subsided in the midday market, and prices stabilized. The market continued to fall near midday, and closing prices returned to the previous day's original levels. However, in the afternoon, rice merchants spread rumors that Hong Kong was not issuing permits for transport, and that transshipped goods would face difficulties. There are many goods waiting for transshipment. As a result, holders took the opportunity to raise prices, and short covering and restocking became very active. The market immediately soared, rising step by step. Futures were especially sought after as customers competed to hoard. No. 1 Saigon for February opened at 94 yuan in the morning and rose to 95 yuan, 96 yuan, and 96.5 yuan in the afternoon. Upper three months was 93.5 yuan and 94 yuan in the morning, and 95.5 yuan in the afternoon. Small batch spot price was 88 yuan in the afternoon and called for 90 yuan. January 15 and 16 was 87.6 yuan in the morning and also called for nearly 90 yuan in the afternoon. February was 87 yuan in the morning and called for 89 yuan in the afternoon, a sharp increase of 2 yuan, which was 1 yuan more than the night before. But 2,000 tons of new broken rice were sold cautiously, with No. 1 and 2 mixed rice at 75.5 yuan and No. 3 broken rice at 65.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Although the arrival of domestic rice such as thick and thin japonica was still not large, the demand from the countryside was weak, resulting in a flat and tired market. Except for thick japonica, where arrivals and sales were similar and there was little price difference, thin rice fell by another half yuan. Qing Jiao Hu saw thin rice at 94.5 yuan to 94 yuan, and the original package at 98 yuan. Changbang special original white japonica was still at 107 yuan, 102.5 yuan for Qing Jiao Hu, Kunshan original white japonica at 1045 yuan, 101 yuan for Qing Jiao Hu, and second grade to 967 yuan.</p>
<p>The supply and demand for glutinous rice were equal yesterday, and the market was unchanged. Hong Kong high white yuan was still 80 yuan, the general market white yuan was 79 yuan to 78.5 yuan, special goods were scarce and not opened.</p>
<h3>Wheat Flour Without Problems - Further Thoughts Presented -</h3>
<p>Wheat Flour: Yesterday, the flour market turned sluggish, mainly because Australian wheat flour arriving by land was being offered for sale, and the problem of supply sources may not be too obstructive. This led to a softening of sentiment, and some speculators were willing to sell. The market opened with some resistance, but soon transactions occurred for "Flower Bird Clock Tower" brand Australian flour at 24.8 yuan, a slight decrease of 0.1 yuan compared to the previous day. Land-route goods also opened at 24.5 yuan, with nearly 10,000 bags sold. It is said that buyers were trying to depress prices. With rice prices also falling, there is fear of further price declines. "Gathering Treasure Basin" flour also had 2-300 bags traded at 24.4 yuan. Chinese-produced flour was still selling at 23 yuan, with the two factories releasing about 6,000 bags. Merchant groups had not yet accepted this price.</p>
<p>Wheat: The market remained persistently sluggish. Some domestic goods occasionally arrived, mostly directly allocated to factories, especially Japanese factories, which bought the most. This is because the environment is controlled by certain parties, so Chinese factories cannot buy wheat and have to rely on foreign wheat. It is said that Fuxin Factory has ordered a shipload of wheat, which will arrive soon.</p>
<h3>Finance: Chinese Banks Sell, Foreign Merchants Buy; Foreign Exchange Supply and Demand Adequately Matched</h3>
<p>Foreign Exchange: Yesterday, the exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed rates. The unofficial market for British and American currency was relatively active in the afternoon, but fluctuations were still minor. Chinese merchants heavily invested in gold and sold foreign exchange, but it was absorbed by foreign banks, and the market price was not affected. One American bank was particularly active in buying. US dollar for the current month traded at 5.3125 yuan. The future market was flat with little activity and stable sentiment, and the closing result was no different from the afternoon. Spot British pound was 3 pence 32825, and US dollar was 5.3125 yuan, with no change from the previous day.</p>
<p>American Banks Bought the Most Actively</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's large-scale transactions, both near and far term, were flat. New York silver prices remained low, and London spot gold was stagnant. Exchange rates for the British pound and Shanghai and the US dollar and Shanghai did not change. There was no market for French francs. The central bank's listed rates remained the same. The banks opened with a spot selling price of British pound at 3 pence 328125 and US dollar at 5.3125 yuan, the same as the closing price of the previous day. After opening, Chinese banks continuously sold, and the market was firm. The profit from selling spot US dollars to British banks was 5.34375 yuan. HSBC's listed rates did not change, and the silver equalization tax also remained unchanged. Later, there was still some negative news in the market, so Chinese speculators sold, but foreign banks were buying, especially one American bank, which bought the most at a relatively low price. It is estimated that this month, the American dollar was taken up by a Macgarity American bank from speculators at 5.3125 yuan. Until noon, it was reported that Chinese speculators sold the next month's US dollar, which was bought by the Chinese banks Dongya, at a price of 5.28125 yuan. The market closed quietly, with spot British pound at 3 pence 328125 and US dollar at 5.3125 yuan.</p>
<p>Few Inquiries About Future Market</p>
<p>The future market was sluggish, with few inquiries about the British and American currencies, resulting in no transactions and no price changes. The evening close was the same as the afternoon price. Spot and current-month British pound was 3 pence 328125, US dollar was 5.3125 yuan, March British pound was 3 pence 3125, and US dollar was 5.28125 yuan, with no change from the previous day's closing price.</p>

At 2:30 pm, the report was flat. Spot US dollar loosened 0.0625 to 23.875 yuan. Spot Shanghai currency rose 0.5 yuan to 449 yuan. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Tianjin British and American Fixed</p>

Shanghai currency also remained unchanged, opening at 90.05 yuan. "Joint banknotes" in the black market alone rose 1 yuan to 78.25 yuan.</p>
<h3>Futures Firm, Cash Advances, Approximately 70-80 Yuan Higher</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market price of spot silver ingot was pulled up from weakness, consistently holding above 6670 yuan, once rising to 6705 yuan. This was because the US dollar weakened due to the possibility of the US freezing funds. After exchange merchants sold in the previous two days, they bought again, creating a buying trend. After opening, Dafeng, Yufeng, Yonghesheng, and Chengji, among others, searched and bought, finally rising to 6705 yuan. At noon, it settled at 6690 yuan. The market opened well in the afternoon, reaching 6700 yuan, but silver shops like Tianyuan sold, and the lowest price was 6676 yuan. The closing result was 6683 yuan, up 6 yuan from the previous day. Cash continued to rise. Shihe sold Defu 130 taels, 70 yuan higher than futures price; Dada sold Gonghe 100 taels, 75 yuan higher. In the afternoon, Hengji sold Tongkang, Yongfu, Kangyong, Tianyuan, and Defu 90 taels, 80 yuan higher. Approximately 7,000 taels were traded in futures. Gold ornaments and customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Silver Ingots Without Large Fluctuations</p>
<p>In the early morning, continuing the sluggishness of the previous day, sentiment remained uninspired. At the opening, various groups competed to sell, pushing the price down by more than 20 yuan, and the opening price was 6650 yuan. However, due to the weakening trend of the exchange market, exchange merchants bought spot silver ingots again, selling US dollars. Therefore, buyers came at the right time, and groups such as Dafeng, Yufengyong, Hesheng, and Chengji all bought, slowly rising above 6700 yuan, with the highest reaching 6705 yuan. However, some bulls, such as Chengji and Xiangxingyong, slightly exited, hindering the upward trend and slowly falling back into the 6700 yuan range, retreating to 6682 yuan. After this, it fluctuated slightly, stabilizing at 6690 yuan in the afternoon. The opening in the afternoon was good, at 6695 yuan. Before long, there was a rush to buy on the table, rising another 5 yuan to 6700 yuan. However, Tianyuan and other silver shops suddenly sold, forcing the price down to 6677 yuan. Fortunately, Xinyuan and Dafeng absorbed, rising back to 6690 yuan. Finally, Tianyuan continued to sell, and the market closed at 6683 yuan, a rise of 6 yuan compared to the previous day. Initially, Dada Cheng, Defu, Jin, Jufeng, Yongjingfu, and others bought two to three hundred taels of spot goods, with prices 70 yuan higher than futures. Later, Hehe bought Yida 100 taels, reaching 75 yuan. In the afternoon, Defu Hengji sold Tongkang a total of 90 taels, for 80 yuan. The whole day's futures fluctuated by 55 yuan. The selling price of the gold shops' own brand gold was 10 yuan higher than spot silver ingots, and the purchase price was 30 yuan lower. The current price of standard gold was 50-60 yuan lower than the listed gold.</p>
<p>Price of Gold Ornaments Unchanged</p>
<p>The exchange price for gold ornaments per tael was listed at 690 yuan by the Da Tong Hang, unchanged. The Xin Tong Hang's price was similar to the previous price, and the purchase price was 30 yuan lower.</p>
<h3>Minor Gains in Foreign Currencies</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the price of spot silver ingot fluctuate, eventually trending slightly higher. British and American gold pounds rose slightly before falling back to flat. US dollar notes rose from 18.5 yuan to 18.6 yuan, finally settling at 18.55 yuan, a slight increase of 0.03 yuan compared to the previous day. Demand for Hong Kong notes remained strong, and the market price continued to rise by 0.01 yuan. Japanese gold notes continued to rise, reaching 1.65 yuan in the evening market. Korean notes weakened slightly, retreating to 1.31 yuan in the evening market.</p>
<h3>Securities: A Watch on the Public Bond Market</h3>
<p>The public bond unofficial market continued its downward trend yesterday, although the decline seemed to have slowed slightly. The environment remained unchanged, but the weakness in sentiment persisted. On the one hand, cash notes could be transacted; on the other hand, cash notes were maturing, absorbing and re-absorbing. Although the two sides seemed to be evenly matched, sellers seemed to be following the market, while buyers were buying at the lows. One side was selective about price, while the other was not. The difference between them was obvious. The opening price of Category C bonds was the same as the previous day's 64.7 yuan, but then gradually declined, falling by more than 1 yuan. After multiple rounds of absorption, it suddenly improved by 0.8 yuan. The competition between bulls and bears still favored the bears, but the strength of both sides was better than before. Previously, the sellers were large investors; now, the sellers were small investors. Previously, the buyers were small investors; now, the buyers were large investors. Considering this situation, the bulls would still be at an advantage in the long run, although they would suffer losses in the short term. Yesterday's sellers included Xinfu, Hu Heji, Runli, Yizhong, and Yuxing, each selling no more than 100,000. Others, such as Shengchang, Jiufeng, Dunyu, and scattered small investors, were limited in number. The buyer, Tongkang alone, bought approximately 500,000. Others, such as No. 16 Xinhua, No. 25 Shengda, and No. 38 Hengkang, each bought more than 100,000. Wanchun absorbed both Category C and Category E bonds, totaling more than 200,000, all buying for its own account. Others, such as Lianhe, Xinchang, Datong, Renchang, Hengfu, and Lianyi, all bought considerable amounts. This shows that there is no problem with the public bonds themselves; it's just unnecessary anxiety. The current decline has been significant, so there must be substantial support. The market price eventually fell by another 0.5 to 0.75 yuan. The total number of transactions was approximately 2.2 million yuan. A brief summary is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory were traded at a price of 32 yuan each.</p>
<p>The stock market opened slightly firm, but then became extremely dull. Wheelock Marden reached a high of 109 yuan, a price that led to a large number of sellers, and closed at 106 yuan with buyers. Transactions for other stocks were also scarce, and rubber stocks showed no improvement.</p>
<p>London, 5th (Wednesday): Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British merchant stocks remained sluggish, with no changes.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: More Cotton Yarn Imported, "Double Horse" Turns from Decline to Rise</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially weakened but then firmed, maintaining a positive trend. Although current yarn sales were not strong, buyers' sentiment was exceptionally enthusiastic. Securities firms and Ming Feng Hao came to bulk purchase and import. As a result, the market became dry, and the market turned from weak to strong. The difference between the high and low prices was as much as 30-40 yuan. The highest price for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn was 1512 yuan, and the low price was 1476 yuan. In the afternoon, it initially traded at 1517 yuan, then at 1510 yuan. Also, 1935 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>The "Double Horse" market opened with most watching and waiting, due to the listless sentiment of the previous afternoon and the very active bears. The opening price was 1480 yuan, a slight drop to 1476 yuan. At this time, the market fluctuated within 4-5 yuan for about 1.5 hours. Later, due to the large-scale absorption by securities firms and the substantial volume, along with slightly positive rumors, the buying trend in the market suddenly intensified, and speculators panicked and actively covered short positions. The market gradually advanced, and the market price rose higher and higher, closing at 1511 yuan. The half-day transaction statistics were 7040 bales. The price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn rose by 20 yuan. The amounts purchased by each group are listed separately as follows:</p>
<p>Same Trade: 7,000 Hong Kong: 40 Total: 7,040</p>
<h3>Manufacturers Wait and See, Cotton Prices Slightly Lower</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation turned flat, with manufacturers being less receptive. As for the same trade, it was not as enthusiastic as the previous day, so the market trend showed a slight decline. Also, 316 bales of cotton arrived from Hong Kong yesterday (6th).</p>
<p>The New York cotton market first fell due to selling by Southern speculators, then rebounded due to the strong rise in Wall Street stocks and buying by the same trade. As a result, the closing price was slightly higher than the previous day by one or two points. The Indian market was flat. Yesterday, including forecasts, it depreciated slightly by about one rupee.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: Because cotton prices were rising, those holding goods were unwilling to sell easily. At the same time, manufacturers turned to wait-and-see attitude due to high prices. Therefore, although the market was firm, few transactions occurred. However, the cotton market base was solid, and yarn prices were stable, so the prediction for the future of the cotton market was optimistic.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Factory Prices Don't Loosen, Cotton Cloth Initially Declines Then Rises</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market fell then rebounded, with a stable trend. Although speculators tended to sell, the factory prices did not loosen. After the same trade bought at low prices, it rose again. However, as a result, plain white coarse and fine cloth and twill cloth still fell by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan per piece. Part of the bleached and dyed cloth fell by about 0.5 yuan per piece. Fine yarn goods were the firmest. 42-count plain silk crepe was selling for 1.45 to 1.55 yuan per yard. Fugui fine cloth initially sold for 44.5 yuan, then rebounded to 45.25 yuan in the afternoon. More than 300 pieces of cloth were transacted on this street. Zhejiang Ningbo merchants handled more than 100 pieces of colored cloth and bleached cloth. Fujian merchants handled nearly 100 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill silk crepe, etc. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants handled more than 100 pieces of colored twill and blue cloth, etc. Today, 295 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Morning declines, afternoon rebounds, and market trends turn upward. Plain white Dragon Head fine cloth opened at the lowest price of 49.2 yuan. Later, due to the rise in yarn prices and retailers purchasing, the price gradually rose. At closing, the transaction price was 49.89 yuan. Because futures continued to rise, sentiment became stronger. The unofficial market price for current bills of lading rose to 50.03 yuan. Four Gentlemen Serge was 1.355 yuan.</p>
<p>"Exchange" afternoon closing prices: February 51.2 yuan, March 52.72 yuan, April 53.55 yuan, May 54.3 yuan, all rebounded by about 0.5 to 1 yuan per piece compared to the previous month.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Cake Prices Slightly Rebound, Soybean Oil Suddenly Rises</h3>
<p>Soybean Cake: Yesterday's futures market trended downward due to active selling. Later, the bulls fought hard and forcefully raised the price. The price only fluctuated by 0.03-0.04 yuan compared to the previous market. Shengji sold 30,000 cakes for March delivery, with prices ranging from 15.25 yuan to 15.12 yuan, then back to 15.2 yuan. Another 20,000 cakes for the second half of March delivery were priced from 15.4 yuan to 15.3 yuan, then to 15.38 yuan. Yuanlong sold 5 cars for the second half of February delivery, priced at 15.25 yuan, and 10 cars for the second half of March delivery, priced from 15.31 yuan to 15.35 yuan. Feizi sold 10 cars for the first half of February delivery, priced from 15.25 yuan to 15.3 yuan. Because all parties were slow in handling spot cakes, sellers feared prolonged unprofitability, so they adopted a sales strategy of lowering prices. Initially, domestic merchants sold 6,000 pieces of Lizibing cakes at 14.8 yuan. Shengji cakes sold 1,000 pieces at 14.9 yuan. Hong Kong merchants followed up and purchased 3,000 pieces of Fazibing cakes at 14.95 yuan. The market price was uniformly about 0.4 yuan lower than before.</p>
<p>Soybean Oil: After falling for consecutive days, the market continued to decline in the morning. Later, a buying trend suddenly emerged, and both futures and spot oil turned upward. As a result, it exceeded the previous day's closing price, with the market rising by 0.5 yuan. 300 barrels of Dalian oil were transacted, priced from 118 yuan to 117.75 yuan, then rebounded to 119.25 yuan. Also, 500 barrels of futures oil, with the price for the second half of February being 118.5 yuan to 119.75 yuan, and the price for the first half of March being 120.05 yuan to 120 yuan, then rising to 121.75 yuan. Dayou factory oil sold for 50 dans, priced at 93 yuan.</p>
<p>Exports: Miscellaneous grains, today (7th), 1,285 bags of beans and 9,580 sheets of bean cake were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw Whites Rebound Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market did not fluctuate much. The guild set the price of spot goods, with the first settlement of raw white sugar on January 10th at 81.56 yuan for outer warehouse, down 0.1-0.2 yuan. The 20th settlement was 81.78 yuan, and the 24th settlement was still 81.9 yuan. The end of February settlement was 82 yuan, down 0.2 yuan, and the March 10th settlement was 82.4 yuan.

DY mark was 78.9 yuan, HX mark was 78.8 yuan, and Crystal Bright ice was 104 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware Black Iron Billets Soaring</h3>
<p>The hardware market has been rising sharply since the opening of the red market, with prices about 50% higher than before. As a result, industry sentiment is very strong, but buyers are afraid to take action, so transactions are not very lively. However, there were many inquiries about black iron billets, so transactions were very smooth, and the market was soaring. Those with goods were even more bullish, and asking prices rose steadily, 100-200 yuan higher than the red market. Yesterday's opening price was already 1,600 yuan. Also, 153 pieces of tin arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Flour Market in 1930 (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xigeng</p>
<p>If each household needs 3.5 bags of flour, then approximately 7,000 bags are needed. Other sales include biscuit factories, candy stores, dim sum shops, seasoning factories, yarn factories, and household use, which are not included. If we consider that flour factories at the time produced over 9,000 bags of flour per day, supply and demand could have been close, and there would have been no significant shortage. However, there was a lot of speculative capital in Shanghai, and speculators took the opportunity to manipulate the market, causing unrest among the public. The Municipal Council, in view of this, again intervened in late September to regulate the market (with each bag costing 16.8 yuan including handling fees), so the flour market gradually entered a peaceful state. This was maintained from September 27th to the end of the year. A total of three phases of cheap flour sales were held. However, in December of last year, due to the relationship of raw materials of our factory, the supply was reduced. The number of deficits was made up by the Municipal Council selecting one tenth of the foreign flour imported into Shanghai by Weida, Heyi, Dafu, Yihuo, and Gongli. The price was still the same as the native flour. The benefits for the civilians were truly not small.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Brands of Flour and Rebagged Flour</p>
<p>In the Chinese flour mills within the occupied areas, those that did not suffer from war damage were taken over by the Japanese one by one, or those with special relationships were allowed to restore themselves. According to what we know, listed as follows:</p>

<h3>XZ School Incident Creates New Complications, Relevant Parties Prepare for Arbitration; Both Sides Approaching Extremes, Mediation Nears Collapse; If Not Resolved Today, Arbitration Will Be Implemented Tomorrow</h3>
<p>(Dahua News Agency) Qunxian Villa, Jinshenfu Road, in this city, at the private Xingzhong Middle School, near the end of the last semester, a portion of the teachers demanded improved treatment but failed. A strike occurred. The resolution of various circumstances by relevant parties was reported by various newspapers. Now, with the start of the new semester, new complications have arisen. The school's attitude is firm, and the teachers have left the school again. Despite exhausting mediation, it still resulted in a rupture. Relevant parties believe that both sides are approaching extremes and are on the verge of collapse, and they are preparing to implement arbitration to resolve the outstanding case. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Initial Incident - Causes and Consequences</p>
<p>The initial strike at the school occurred near the end of the last semester. Eight female teachers participated in the strike. Their original demands were: (1) double salary for January of this semester; (2) a 50% salary increase starting next semester; (3) salary for six months starting next semester; (4) no unjustified dismissal of faculty and staff; (5) no arbitrary insults to teachers; (6) a rice subsidy for non-resident teachers. As a result of the mediation, the school accepted the following items: (1) a 30% to 40% salary increase starting next semester; (2) no unjustified dismissal of faculty and staff; (3) all teachers can live in the school. At that time, the strike subsided, and both sides were at peace.</p>
<p>New Complications - Second Strike</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, at the start of this semester, the school principal, Wu Jingbo, believed that two teachers, Xu Heng and Wu Tianjing, were substitute teachers and had no contract with the school. He believed that he was not bound by the above mediation agreement. Therefore, on the one hand, he invited the original teachers to work at the school. On the other hand, he notified the substitute teachers that they did not need to substitute. As a result, one of the original teachers returned the contract and did not want to be hired. The principal hired someone else to replace him. Disputes arose from this. The teachers believed that the substitute teachers Xu Heng and Wu Tianjing had served for nearly half a year, and the principal did not officially hire them but insisted that the original teacher return to work at the school. It was obvious that he was playing tricks to achieve his goal of dismissing them on purpose. They unanimously protested, demanding that the two substitute teachers be formally hired as formal teachers. The principal sternly refused, and his wife, Mrs. Liu (who also taught at the school), spoke rudely. The teachers felt insulted, and the situation became more tense, leading to the unfortunate event of a second strike.</p>
<p>Mediation Breaks Down - Preparing for Arbitration</p>
<p>After the second strike, the teachers requested that relevant parties continue to send personnel to mediate. The original mediator was assigned to handle the matter, but despite efforts, little progress was made. Three of the teachers suddenly returned to work and resumed classes as usual. The others, such as Ge Fengzhen, resigned in anger, expressed their determination, and engaged in indiscriminate publicity, disregarding the overall situation. The situation became increasingly dire. Although the relevant parties sent personnel again yesterday morning for a final mediation, urging the school authorities not to close the last door for negotiation, the result was still a failure, and the mediation finally broke down. In order to resolve the matter quickly, the relevant parties are preparing to implement arbitration and first issued a severe warning to the teacher Liu Guo Fu, the principal's wife.</p>

<p>Essays</p>
<h3>The First Day of Class</h3>
<p>— Guo Wenqiang</p>
<p>In Shanghai (I don't know about other places), the "start of school" and the "first day of class" are disconnected. That is to say, school starts without classes immediately; classes begin several days after the start of school.</p>
<p>Today—three days after the school opening ceremony—school has started.</p>
<p>Crowds of people, classmates all brought their new books to class. Some even wrapped their new books in "picture paper," showing that they cherish things in a strange way. Most of the classmates are old, with only one or two new transfer students.</p>
<p>The first lesson and the second lesson are over, and the classmates are happily chatting and laughing.</p>
<p>"Why didn't Lao Fang come to class today?" Xiao Chen was the first to open the conversation.</p>
<p>"Don't just say today, he probably won't come to class tomorrow either. I heard he won't be continuing his studies this year." A classmate answered.</p>
<p>"Who said that?"</p>
<p>"Who else would say it? He said it himself. I ran into him the day before yesterday."</p>
<p>"Why is that? He's graduating after this semester." The classmates were all talking.</p>
<p>"Isn't it because he can't pay the tuition? The tuition for this semester has increased by twelve yuan again."</p>
<p>Lao Fang is a top student in the school, not very tall, very thin, and eloquent. Unfortunately, his family is too poor, living from day to day. I heard that his father works on a boat. He is a very kind person.</p>
<p>"Won't Lao Fang take the scholarship exams held by various schools?" Xiao Chen asked again.</p>
<p>"Maybe he will." In the end, Xiao Chen answered himself.</p>
<p>Xiao Chen and Lao Fang are very good classmates, you could say they are bosom friends. Of course, Xiao Chen was very uneasy when he heard that Lao Fang was going to drop out of school. Now he is making propaganda, trying to use the collective power to prevent Lao Fang from dropping out.</p>
<p>"Everyone, my friends, Lao Fang is a top student in our class. It's heartbreaking that he's dropping out of school because he can't pay tuition... We should help him, materially..."</p>
<p>The voice went from gentle to indignant.</p>
<p>The overflow of emotion was unstoppable. At this moment, everyone exposed their passionate hearts. Everyone couldn't help but say:</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"We must help him!"</p>
<p>Xiao Chen was very happy, he felt that his words had a great effect. So he counted the classmates standing and sitting around him, thirty-three old classmates, two new ones, thirty-five in total. Xiao Chen spoke again:</p>
<p>"First of all, I'll help Lao Fang with five yuan. I hope everyone will donate as much as possible."</p>
<p>As soon as he finished speaking, classmates called out one yuan, two yuan, fifty cents...</p>
<p>The two new classmates also donated one yuan each.</p>
<p>Before long, a total of forty-three yuan and fifty cents was collected. From tomorrow, Lao Fang won't have to drop out of school. Everyone was very happy.</p>
<p>Xiao Chen was busy writing a letter, asking everyone to sign it, meaning to show their friendship and enthusiasm, with Xiao Chen as the representative.</p>
<p>In the evening, Xiao Chen went to Lao Fang's house. Lao Fang was so moved by the letter brought by Xiao Chen that he shed tears.</p>
<p>For the sake of a friend, and also for the sake of the country, this is a meaningful action.</p>
<h3>Random Notes</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yinji</p>
<p>"Jesus, Amen!"</p>
<p>A six-year-old child and a seven-year-old daughter of a relative are studying at a large church school in the French Concession. But after studying for a whole year, they haven't learned anything. The only two sentences they can say are: "Jesus loves the world, we also love Jesus, Amen!"</p>
<p>Mechanical Pencils</p>
<p>One of my young sisters is studying at a certain girls' middle school on Lafayette Road. Today, when she went to school to pay the remaining fees, the school's head of academics actually used "mechanical pencils" as an incentive, saying: If you introduce one student, you can get a free pencil, etc. Hearing this, I can't help but sigh for the future of the sacred cause of education!</p>
<p>Foreign Songs</p>
<p>A friend of mine, in a conversation, casually said to me: "Now many young male and female students often like to hum foreign songs, but to be honest, some of them have never even taken an English class. He (she) sings "foreign songs," probably with Chinese annotations written next to them." At the time, I was so amused by him that I couldn't close my mouth. Although these are unconscious jokes, they are all a great satire of current education.</p>
<h3>A Disguised Tuition Increase</h3>
<p>— Mo Leng</p>
<p>When schools increase tuition, teachers can take the opportunity to demand salary increases. As a result, the increased portion of tuition is reduced due to salary increases. Therefore, schools have to think of a perfect solution. On one hand, they want tuition revenue to increase, and on the other hand, they want to deprive teachers of any excuse to demand salary increases. This method is very simple, which is to desperately force students to take make-up exams, thereby increasing make-up exam fees.</p>
<p>My younger brother received a notice from the school that three of the six subjects he had chosen required make-up exams, and a notice was attached stating: "From next semester onwards, the make-up exam fee will be uniformly increased to five yuan per subject." At first, we thought that my younger brother's grades had declined, but later we learned that almost eight or nine out of ten of my younger brother's classmates had to take make-up exams.</p>
<p>Make-up exams are given because some students' grades are between passing and failing, giving them an opportunity. This situation was originally extremely rare, but now it is so common that we have to believe that the school is suspected of changing students' grades. The main method of changing grades is to reduce scores of sixty or seventy by several points to a dozen points, or even increase scores of thirty or forty by ten points to a dozen points, so that the majority of students will be forced to take make-up exams.</p>
<p>Every student has one or more make-up exam grades, averaging two per person, which is equivalent to increasing tuition by ten yuan per semester, while at the same time waving the banner that the school's tuition will not increase. And they tell the teachers, our work in the education field is the most sacred, we should endure all the pain to serve the education field.</p>
<p>Impoverished students often lose their chance at education, despite receiving help from relatives and friends, due to poor grades. However, these poor grades are not due to the students' own lack of effort.</p>
<p>It is chilling to hear that an educational institution is using improper methods to seek profit; and misleading young people is even more sinful!</p>
<p>Several weeks ago, after the article "A Good News" was published in this column, I, who was about to suffer the pain of dropping out of school, felt that this was an excellent opportunity for me to continue my studies.</p>
<h3>A Record of Taking the Impoverished Student Scholarship Exam</h3>
<p>— Wang</p>
<p>Truly a piece of good news for us impoverished students!</p>
<p>That night, I wrote a letter of application, applying for assistance.</p>
<p>Three weeks later, a reply came, asking me to come for an interview on a certain day. Although this was just a thin postcard with only a few words on it, it gave me a flower of hope to continue my studies.</p>
<p>A not-too-big, not-too-small living room, neatly arranged, decorated in a mix of Chinese and Western styles, with calligraphy and paintings of celebrities, antiques, soft sofas, chrome coffee tables, and a redwood eight immortals table. On one side of the wall, there was even a couplet handwritten by Yuan Lida, the director of the Orphanage, praising the owner's charitable acts, which was enough to prove that the owner was a kind and generous elder. More than a dozen applying students sat quietly around the long round table, waiting for the exam. At 1:00 PM, the exam began. Each person had to write one essay in Chinese and one essay in English. The Chinese topic was "Self-Description," and the English topic was "My School Life." Afterwards, the exam papers of the test takers were all graded, and the students who received the scholarship could go to the location to collect the scholarship the next day. Luckily, I was one of them.</p>
<p>The person who gave us the scholarship and enabled us to continue our studies was a kind and gentle elder surnamed Pan. When receiving the scholarship, Mr. Pan personally inquired and then issued the scholarship. When I was called upstairs for inquiry, Mr. Pan very politely asked me to sit down. After the questions were completed, he told me the following:</p>
<p>"When I was studying, I was also a poor and impoverished student. In order to study, I often encountered various difficulties. However, I was not discouraged, and eventually succeeded. In view of the difficult circumstances I faced during my studies, I feel sympathy for current impoverished students, so I have set up ten scholarships each semester to help impoverished and outstanding students. I hope you will not disappoint my sincerity. If you achieve success in the future, you should also recall your difficult circumstances when you were studying and help other impoverished students."</p>
<p>I received the scholarship, and my heart was filled with joy, because I could continue my studies. Here, I represent all impoverished students in expressing our infinite respect to Mr. Pan.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Actually, she can't be considered tall, just the right height! Her face and body exude a very lovely delicate charm. I really like her! Every time we eat, I always have to turn my face to look at her!" Another third-grade student said innocently.</p>
<p>In fact, there are many classmates who like Luo Xiangqi. She treats everyone very kindly. Although she gets first place every year, she is less pretentious than those who repeat grades every year. Although her family is very poor, she dresses more neatly than the richest people. She can follow the teacher's words appropriately, but never excessively flatter them. For four years, she has never committed a fault. Even Principal Hou, who is so eccentric and likes to be critical of everything, cannot help but secretly admit that she is his most proud student.</p>
<p>When Principal Hou decided to appoint her as the representative to give the speech of thanks, he was unexpectedly calm. She did not exhibit any of the pretense that girls commonly display, such as crying, laughing, or making repeated refusals. Although several of her classmates, who were jealous of her, were constantly sarcastic towards her, with some pretending to be happy for her, saying a long string of well-wishes that were more malicious than insults, and others pretending to be worried for her, urging her to decline the position to Principal Hou, Luo Xiangqi's response was always just a faint smile.</p>
<p>Indeed! Xiangqi really took this matter very lightly in her heart. Before Principal Hou appointed her as the representative, she really did not expect others to recommend her. Once Principal Hou circled her name, she immediately felt that this was a very ordinary obligation, just like she had been appointed as the class leader for the past three years, not worth marveling at, but also not necessary to decline. She thought that going on stage to face her entire school and a few guests, and giving a polite speech like reciting from a book, what was so surprising about that? If she gave a good speech, people would just applaud and be done. If she didn't give a good speech, people wouldn't necessarily boo her off the stage. It was just a short time, and surely it wouldn't be more difficult than regular homework.</p>
<p>Although it was not difficult, the impact that this short speech later had on herself was certainly not what she had anticipated! The course of her life, as a result of this speech of less than ten minutes, went from a very smooth and minimally winding road to another bumpy and dangerous path. If she had known beforehand that there would be such a result, she would certainly have preferred to be expelled by Principal Hou, and resolutely refuse to be this ominous representative! (24)</p>

<p>Entertainment World</p>
<p>New Movie Introduction</p>
<h3>"The Mark of Zorro"</h3>
<p>— Cheng Bingnu</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, Fanbonk's "The Thief of One Green" was a sensation. Twenty years later, Taylor Power's "The Mark of Zorro" is still loved by audiences. Undoubtedly, the script is quite exquisite, and the development of the story is full of tension and twists. I have not seen Fanbonk's "The Thief of One Green", so I cannot compare the two films. But imagining it, a character like Diego, played by Fanbonk, would certainly have more than enough charisma, but perhaps not enough charm. Similarly, no matter how hard Taylor Power tries, his charisma should always be less than that of the old Fan.</p>
<p>The story of "The Mark of Zorro" is about how the green-shirted people of 18th-century Spain were abused under the rule of the tyrant Don Luis. Of course, the people would not always be willing to be cattle and horses, so the protagonist Diego came out in the guise of a masked hero to eliminate violence and bring peace. He has excellent martial arts skills, he can fence, he can ride horses, he dares to openly tear down the notices of officials increasing taxes, and he also dares to break into the official residence in the middle of the night to play tricks on the cowardly tyrant Don Luis.</p>
<p>But when he takes off his black mask, he becomes Don Luis's friend, a young and handsome gentleman. He accepts the teasing of Don Luis's wife, and also accepts the infatuation of Loreta. He is knowledgeable in romantic affairs, and he knows how to cherish women. Such a character is naturally a hero in the eyes of the people at the time. Beauty loves a hero, and Loreta's infatuation with Zorro is a natural occurrence. (Attached copper picture)</p>
<p>Although the playwright did not emphasize the romance of the male and female leads, the writing of the suffering of the people, and the resistance arising from the suffering, seems to be insufficient. Similarly, his writing of Diego's fencing and horse riding only depicts a vigorous hero, while neglecting the countless unnamed commoners who support this hero—the people. This method of eliminating violence for the people is purely individual heroism. If it was not Diego who led this uprising, there would be a risk of failure.</p>
<p>Perhaps director McMullen knew of this defect, and in the final escape from prison climax, he especially emphasized the roar, cheers, and participation in the resistance of the people. That grand scene is exciting enough. As for the brisk tone of the whole play, and the concise and smooth pictures, there is naturally nothing to criticize. Taylor Power's acting skills are much better than in "The Rains Came". Linda Darnell is also quite lovely. In short, this is a film worth watching.</p>
<h3>Watching Shenxin No. 2 Factory's Tongle Rehearsal</h3>
<p>— Ashamed</p>
<p>The Shenxin No. 2 Factory Peking Opera Troupe holds an annual rehearsal during the Lunar New Year, both to delight all employees and to guide them towards proper recreation, avoiding unnecessary waste. This method is excellent. The plays performed this spring were quite wonderful. Here are some excerpts:</p>
<p>Shu Hen Ji. This play is an old one, rarely performed in Shanghai. Shen Shuwei plays Zhu Chundeng, with excellent singing and acting. He eats in Zheng Palace and above. The long section of Fan Erhuang during the sacrifice is the highlight of the play. Yu Zhangji's Zhao Jintang and Mr. Shen are evenly matched in skill, and his posture is particularly stable. Wu Qi's Zhu Chunke is quite helpful as a supporting role.</p>
<p>Eight Hammers. Chen Shouzhi as Wu Zuo, Liu Xiaonong as Lu Wenlong, Zhao Jinshen as the wet nurse. Mr. Chen sings in the Yu style, maintaining a good standard. The hanging hair when he cuts off his arm is high and light, showing great skill. In the section where he leaves the book, the eye contact between Lu and the wet nurse in a few lines of dialogue is particularly outstanding. (Attached stage photo)</p>
<p>Famen Temple. Li Ruiting's Zhao Lian sings better than he acts. When he leaves the stage, after a long section of slow board Er Liu, the phrase "Fang Da Dan" three words is raised, which is commendable.</p>
<p>June Snow. Miss Jun Ceng's Dou E has a clean and beautiful appearance, and has a gift for a good voice. She sings the Cheng style and has a solid foundation. This ring set, Liu Xiaonong plays Huang Tianba, Xu Jing plays Erdun. Mr. Liu is young and handsome, and his appearance is superb. His singing, acting, and spoken lines have a heroic spirit. Xu's voice is loud and clear. The passage of flowing water is clear and decisive. Wu Qi plays He Tianlong in reverse. The few fights between the dart and Mr. Liu are tight, skilled, and certainly not easy.</p>
<p>Three Mothers Teach Son. Zhu Zhonghua's Wang Chun'e, with a stable and flawless opening, several passages of Erhuang, singing in a desolate and gentle manner, is very pleasant to listen to. Zhou Ganshu's Xue Bao follows the old style and does not use greasepaint on his face. He sings the Wu Shaolou style. Little Sister Li Wenrong, who plays Yige, is Mr. Li Ruiting's daughter. Her lines are practiced and her expressions are lively, adding a lot of color to the play.</p>
<p>Killing the Fisherman. Ye Naijun's Xiao En, every move does not lose his heroic nature. The "Last Night" section of the original board is quite pleasant to listen to.</p>
<p>On that day, the performance lasted from 12:30 PM to 6:30 PM. The audience maintained excellent order. According to the person in charge of the factory's Peking Opera Troupe: "In the near future, we will hold another public rehearsal. We hope that the connoisseurs of Shanghai will not hesitate to give us their advice."</p>
<h3>A Grand Gathering of Kunqu Opera</h3>
<p>The old famous painter Fan Shaoyun, in addition to painting, always amuses himself with music and songs. Last night, at his residence in Meili Garden on Daxilu, he invited Yin Zhenxian, Yu Zhenfei, Wu Jinglue, Zhang Ziqian, Yan Lizhen, and his son Fan Boyan to play music together to add to the elegant fun. All of them are masters of music and opera. They played famous songs, all of which were excellent. The last two songs were composed by Yu Zhenfei, with Fan Boyan playing the flute. Then Yin Zhenxian played a song, Yu sent Fei to play, singing in turn, all the beauties were present, truly a grand gathering.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Art Scene</h3>

<h3>Li Amao's Hygiene Mailbox</h3>
<p>Taking supplements but forgetting to supplement strength is like entering a treasure mountain empty-handed.</p>
<p>(Mr. Shen Wuying asks) Wuying likes to pick his ears. Five years ago, he injured his ear while picking it at a barber shop. Since then, it often discharges water, causing pain and itching, which is unbearable. He has purchased various medicines to treat it, but all have been ineffective. May I ask what medicine should be used to cure it?</p>
<p>(Answer) All the orifices of the human body are like the seaports of a country, and no foreign objects may enter them; otherwise, it is easy to cause trouble, and this is not only true of the ear. Now that you have developed a disease, you should consult a specialist in otolaryngology to treat the condition. Ordinary medicines cannot cure it. In the future, when you go to a barber shop, you should refuse ear picking, because a moment of small pleasure often leads to great pain.</p>
