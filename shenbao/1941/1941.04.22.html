<p>封鎖中國之努力中、現漸感覺艱苦之敎訓、以理論言、中國海岸錢北自渤海灣、南至東京灣、皆遭封鎖、但以事實言、日方甫隔斷此處罅隙、而他處隙漏巳即發生、如漏水皮帶然，新近北海所遭之襲擊、固予華人以重大打擊、使路綫中斷、而有價値之供應品、亦被毀壞、同時滇緬公路因湄江橋之屢遭轟炸、亦未能抵補滇越路之損失、然而各種接濟、終出日方所不能希望封鎖之各　源源運入中國內地、日方欲在目前狀態下、作全部之封鎖、則必在自滿洲邊界、而達越南之海岸、每隔六碼駐守一兵而後可、縱使此而可為、然在偷速日貨可獲重利之處、亦不能發生效力、日方所抱車慶政府孤立內地、僅成偏安局勢之希望、亦復歸於泡影、前當滇緬公路封鎖時、重慶所得之接濟誠屬極少、但滇緬路之復開、英美對華之借款、寇利之遊歷中國、羅斯福總統之允予援助、已使陪都大為興奮矣、中國在</p>
<p>作戰初期固為自己計、亦為西方民治國計、今此言已為世人所公認矣、中國現望多獲接濟、俾不獨對侵略者反守為攻、且固定其在世界總解決中之地位、蓋中國將來之和平與安全、實繫於世界總解决也、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>浙閩戰事的性質</h3>
<p>最近四五日，日本武力對於中國的浙江與福建兩省沿海各郡、突然採取攻勢；或由海軍砲火掩護而强行登陸，或用飛機轟炸為前驅而進襲腹地，或以錢塘江南岸為據點而向南推進。據各方消息，這一决日卓竄擾所及的地點，在浙江方面有　紹興，諸曁，鎭海，臨浦，石浦，海門，瑞安等處；在福建方面有長樂的漳源，連江口的大小澳；至記者握筆時為止，且有日軍攻陷了髯波與溫州而發生巷戰之說。我們異常同情於迫一帶人煙稠密之區遭逢屠殺，生產富饒之區遭逢摧殘；然而回想四年前發動全面作戰之初，中國朝野即已料到入國必須忍受慘痛犧牲，而沿海沿江的各省縣允將首先罹此浩刧，則浙閩各地瓦全四年以至今日而始成戰區，在當初便非意外，况在此日此時！</p>
<p>日本海陸空軍在中國浙閩，這樣的三軍呼應，多方發動，同時並舉，分途進攻，似乎效顰德國的閃電戰術，似乎閃電戰術之具體而微。然而不然。閃電戰術的要義是行軍的捷速、戰鬭力量集矢於對力的一個焦點，覷準了對方所必守的命脈，不避堅强，以殊途同歸的原則，以猛撲的姿態，予以致命的打擊。因此種種要義的高度運用與發揮，德國在今日以前遂得在東歐北歐西歐曁巴爾幹相繼獲致異常的戰績。試將目前日本什中國浙閩的作戰力略，考覈之於所謂閃電戰術的要義，眞可謂十有九錯，百無一是，那配視為閃電戰術；祇是同一時、同一隅的「零散動一而已。</p>
<p>什現代戰爭之中。一面是消耗的鉅大之至，任何物資，決非十位百位千位萬位的計數所得濟事；一面是有關戰爭的一切力量之保持與培養以及其應用，必然是極精密的極嚴格的，一絲不苟，錙銖必較。從這一點觀察，我們感覺近日浙閩戰事在中日戰爭的全局之中，實是雙方的不經濟。而這一浙閩戰事的主動者，實是至愚。蓋就日本方面說，浙閩局勢旣不足以影響全局，更不足決定全局，復何與於所企求的解決所謂中國事變？然則無論日軍在浙閩的成敗利鈍如何，祇是增加一筆不必要的消耗，若揆之以一切力量錙銖必較的保持與培養，遠矣遠矣。就中國方面說，一城一鎭的毀損與失陷，雖日無關全局，然至少有若干萬千人民的生死禍福關係，至少有若干萬千資產的得失存亡關係；故從戰爭力量的觀點，決不容輕藐一城一鎭如草芥。事在雙方同其不經濟，所不同者在意義；主動由日本的無聊，被動而作戰旣屬義無返顧，况中國的基本戰略，端惟使對方繼續不斷的更大消耗而已。</p>
<p>或說日本這一决的發動，絕非無聊，要在封鎖浙閩方面的海口，使中國不再從這些海口獲得海外接濟，故意義在經濟，此舉亦不算不經濟。其實日本封鎖海口久已實行，豈待這一决的登陸作戰；近年這些海口之所以並非絕對窒息，則因往來海舶與日方先有何種默契，不因日軍未登陸，亦不因日方封鎖不夠强密。何况這些海口近年對南洋吞吐的物質數量極微，而對上海的獨多；近年上海對內地則如孤島，在本身則無異於日本商貨的獨佔市塲；然則日方這一决絕對封鎖了浙閩海口之結果，徒使上海的日貨，喪失了由浙閩滲透主自由中國的最後機會。從這一點看，此舉是經濟的，還是不經濟的？</p>
<p>至於解釋之為蘇日協定的後果，為日本外交成功後的軍事擴展，為解決所謂中國事變的推進之一貌；如此云云，亦未見其然。蘇日協定經蘇聯當局聲明了對華援助政策的不變之後，已根本喪失其為日本對華試作神經戰爭的工具之作用，遑論對華的其他作用。謂因蘇日協定使日本北顧無憂而得調遣其北方駐軍，移作他用，則不但根本上殊多疑問，且訂的不及旬日而遽得移兵用之浙閩，允事理所不可能。可見日本於外交上簽訂蘇日協定為一事，軍事上發動浙閩戰事為又一事，二者絕不相干。若謂蘇日協定的本質雖無裨於日本解決所謂中國事變，然日本固得視此協定為充實了日本厲行其所謂國策的基調；由此基調的充實，遂得悍然不顧一切，茲乃放手有為於浙閩，以求貫澈其以軍事征服中國的初衷。這一說，任何人無從代日方加以吾定。然從純粹的軍事來觀察，從純粹的軍略來剖析，在國際戰爭中，浙閩乃兵家所不爭之地，決非整個中日戰爭的決戰塲所；即就浙閩一隅而論，中國方面雖決心隨地作戰，雖準備隨時痛擊，然沿海，沿錢塘江閩江，如近日日軍所竄擾的一帶。却亦決非中國所選擇的會戰戰塲；再稍深入，便有崇山峻嶺，那纔是入寇者的天然墳墓！</p>

<h3>西內閣連日集議　傳將有重大決定　外長蘇納報告國際局勢　尤注意最近英國之挫敗</h3>
<p>馬德里　西班牙內閣集議兩日、咋夜結束後、發表官報稱、」外長蘇納對目下國際大局中重要軍事與外交事件之各方面、發表言論」、西班牙法西斯黨阿列巴報據此著文、與此前西班牙將有政治上決議時該報所刊文宇頗相類似、據稱、「凡與領導吾人命運的唯一外交政策相悖之議論、不能加以考慮、吾人對於外交之見解、須歸一致、凡作他想者、乃叛國之懦夫、（廿一日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據來自馬德里之消息、一般人十咸信、西班牙經兩日之閣議以後、對戰事將有重大之決定、西班牙外長蘇納向西四閣閣員報吿國際軍事外交局勢之最近情形、允注意於最近英國之挫收、此間若干觀察家咸信、西政府中之有力派、藉軸心國壓力之助、企圖將西班牙牽入戰事、傳將來英國敗北以後、可分得一杯羹、惟傳西班牙具他方面、則贊成繼續保持中立、因彼等相信、英國將渡過今後數日內之危機、而占得上風也、傳弗朗哥將軍之顧問會謂、戰局或將有不測之突變、彼等又指出「義大利之敎訓」、蓋當義大利加入戰事時、以為戰事結果、所有民治國必將敗北也、衆知美國之外交政策、對西班牙加入戰事、必力持反對、西班牙早處於飢饉中、駐美西使正籲請美國、以糧食救濟西國人民、而美亦予巳若干救濟矣、萬一西國參戰、則斷不能再冀美國之援助、而對內必須應付飢饉、對外又須防禦英國之攻擊也、（二十一日國際社電）</p>
<p>馬德里　中立方面推測、西班牙頗有官布與軸心國合作之可能性、並有協助軸心國進攻直布羅陀、侵入葡萄牙、或佔領亞速爾以為潛艇根據地之可能、衆信西班牙之援助軸心國、不在積極參戰、而在順從軸心意旨、不加阻撓、（二十一日國際社電）</p>
<p>歐戰叢談（四）（六）</p>
<h3>美國海軍大觀</h3>
<p>海軍大學一裏的學員們，對於室內的模擬戰最感興味。當然，假的戰事不能和眞正戰事相提並論。但是作戰的理論，總是一樣。所堪慮的，就是從過去的經騐來講，作戰之先，大家總覺得在戰略上，一切都佈置得很周密，計算得十分精確，那知一個岔子出來，全盤皆錯，弄得無可挽救。此其原因，當然不能不歸咎於人的疏忽和錯誤了。軍校中的一切訓練目標，即以完備精細為根基，使美國的海軍力量，能應　仟何不同的環境。其精細周密之處，有德國的軍事學專家，始能媲美並論。每當一個戰略確定之後，萬環境發生變化，那末所有的策略，也就跟同立刻　更了。</p>
<p>室內模擬戰的策略當然是十全十美，無懈可　。每一隻玩具般的軍艦模型，代表某一國的海軍力量之一部份。所有軍艦的噸位火力及特殊各點，都一一標明，故參加於作戰者，對於自己和敵方的力量咸能瞭然於胸中。每决模擬戰進行時，雙方作戰策略，以及陣形及調遺步驟等，咸嚴守　密，各用幔幕隔離，不使對方窺見。敎練官充仟評判員，事先把海上的犬氣，風向，一元示知學生。學生則各自調兵遺將，做着總指揮應做的事悄。他們連講說話都不肯隨便，深恐自己的作戰計劃於無意中洩漏出去，而害了　國　事呢。</p>
<p>小的黑幕代表烟幕。飛機懸在桿子上，其飛翔的高度亦經註明。艦舶的行　則以粉筆在地下漆布上畫明。雙方的潛水艇隊及空車隊指揮在他室中聽候命令，準備調動。在規定的時問中，總指揮排起陣形，各種軍艦的速率或方向，開放各種砲，舉放烟幕，派出偵察機，或轟炸敵人的給養艦，一切好像在眞正的戰事中，不容稍有大意。</p>
<p>評判昌坐在隔艙板壁之後，悉心注視着雙方的行動，並計算雙方艦隊所受的損傷程度。其計算方法，係根據「條現」簿上所載某艦的力量如何而定。譬如某一軍艦已遭遇了若干砲火或轟炸的損害，那末其戰鬥力就要喪失至若干程度。像這樣的作戰，其時間要經一星期之久，評判員然後下最俊批評，決定進攻的艦隊是吾　完成　一種任務，或竟遭遇失敗。</p>
<p>歷史上有名的海戰也常常在室內重新搬演。一九一六年「查德蘭」一役，英海車囚失着而致牽動大局者，在海軍大學中亦不時提出來作為演習的材料。英德海軍在海上交戰時，祗有十二小時之久，但在室中則這一戰却要打上三個星期。有時候敎官們為測騐學昌的急智起見，常常提出若干「速決問題」，叫他們在三分鐘至五分鐘之間，給予回答。</p>
<p>海軍大學當局，為「考貝」希特勒的所謂軍事外交打成一片，行動和言論合成一體起見，常邀陸軍或海軍陸戰隊的長官們，以及抱負遠大的外交界人員們，去聽他們的演講。在海軍大學之內，學生們並不穿着制服，學生的官銜比敎官高時，亦往往有之。全校計有敎官二十二員，專家四十人，擔仟授課。故目下敎員的人數反比學生為多。校中的圖書館藏有七萬五千冊和海軍有關的專門書籍。校中無試騐，亦不分等級，不過能力高强的學生總是佔先一着。除了正常的功課外，另有函授部，專供不能親自來校的學生們研習。從大體上講來，這一所海軍大學雖不能稱為頂好的軍校，可是比較起來，在世界上總是俊俊者了</p>
<p>（五）水手和軍官訓練</p>
<p>只有軍艦而沒有人手，那末幾百萬噸的鋼鐵還是無從發揮它們的威力。談到航海兩字，何等困難，非得把一生的精力都放在裏面，難望有所成就。何況戰艦擔負着殺敵致果的重仟，在巨浪滔天的驚濤怒海中，作戰參謀室中不可有絲毫的差誤，砲搭之中完全要出以協力合作。造成一個水手，需要六年工夫的入伍訓練。造一隻軍艦的時間也不過如此。</p>
<p>美國的水手在人力供應方面，可無虞缺乏。在今後四年之中，兩洋海軍即使要三十萬之　的水手，也不致發生　難問題。因為美國的海軍補充兵，其人數常常保持至相當限度，而從不感到缺乏。充當水兵者，最好具有中學三年程度，智力體力都以此時為最合格。</p>
<p>年滿十八歲的美國青年就有加入海軍充當水手的資格。入任之後，先在米西根湖的「大湖海軍訓練所」　六個星期的基本訓練。然後送上軍艦，住在二十個人一起的「狹弄」式艙中，切實領教做水手的一切看家本領。服從紀律，忍耐勞苦，每件事都很嚴格。除非他轉入「亞那波里」海軍學校，那末他祇有一輩子當小兵，終身不能戴金綫徽，更不要說起海軍大將了。但是水手們可學的功課。門類也極多，在岸上的學習所多至五十九處，按步就班的學習上去，也能獲得一個小小的「前程」呢。（未完）</p>

<p>雜糧油餅市塲、自被限價賣買以來、各種交易、昨始轉呈活絡、原因該市傷各貨名目繁多、貨品高低不一、目非按班排日有市、故對於限價一層、有感下手難、因之大局鬆懈、賣買勢轉熱鬧、推豆餅交易允烈、行情在半公開式之情形下、頻見挺升、在本月內為最新高價、計成交牲記豆餅四千餘片、價自十七元四角、猛砌至十八元、訂期交六千片、價為四月底交卞八元一角二角、五月上交十八元二角半至五角半、元隆餅及肥字餅訂五月上交價為十八元四角、成交二十五車、昌記餅一千片、價為十八元零五分、乃訂四月下交貨源記現餅價為十七元三角、五月上交為十八元一角、成交三千片、利字現餅成交二千片、價為十七元五角、至五角半、去路實銷占三分之一、餘為行囤及踢皮球主顧云、今日有豆子二百五十包運厦門、八百四十五包運香港、並有芝蔴一百四十包、生油一千聽同去、</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗跌後又跳　傍晚重出五百元關</h3>
<p>紗市續疲、因浙東戰事劇烈、致入心稍虛、同時空方活躍、市盤乃不振、惟二十支雙馬紗走勢尙不衰弱、上週末、安南有辦去一千六百包、價為一千四百三十元、本日港幫買去一千包、價為一千四百十元、此項現貨、即刻裝運出境、於是看漲者頗不乏人也、二十支雙馬高價為一千五百元、低價為一千四百七十七元、午後初做一千四百八十八元、漲至九十一元、有一部份空頭復來賣出、仍回至一千四百八十七元半、三點鐘後、聞標金暴騰、紗市隨之上升至一千五百十五元、最後價為一千五百十四元、成交頗旺云、今日有棉紗三百九十五件運香港、二百五十件運邏羅、三十件運烟臺、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、市塲人氣和善、但看跌者居多數、因寗紹局勢不佳、首盤價為一千四百九十九元、旋後受賣者多而買者少之影響、檯面鬆懈、市盤遂步下降至一千四百七十七元、但雙馬現銷尙稱不弱、扒補者接踵而來、新多頭稍稍活動、同時標金平定、漸漸而升至一千四百九十二元、乃盤略平、為一千四百八十七元、查半日間成交統計九千九百五十五包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分別如左、香港　，一五五安南一、六〇〇同行六、二〇〇統計九、九五五</p>
<h3>棉市稍靜</h3>
<p>現棉情况稍平、成交亦不及　日之熱鬧、此因紗市復見回風、而外滙寗靜、所以人心平定、廠方無甚成交、號家方面亦僅少數之對租絨略有掉動、其餘皆在沉靜狀態中、但大衆心理、對於前途仍屬望高也、昨有棉花八百零五件自香港來、又昨共成交二千六百件、又二百包、價漲一二元、茲再分錄如下、</p>

<p>蘭貢花　三六·五協同興二〇〇件</p>
<p>蘭貢花　三七　協同興四〇〇件</p>
<p>另訊洋行外棉交易、似因浙東形勢惡劣、謠傳寗波失守而稍抑、但棉市脚地仍極堅定、並不因之人心惶恐、而市况平淡、昨日連同業及廠方成交仍不少、申新並購進長絲毛之埃及棉一千包、售價竟接近四百九十元左右也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、先因各方了結及美總統業斯福反對增加扶助農民貸款之政治消息、從華盛頓傳來而跌、但續後叉因空頭抵補而稍有上昇、結果收盤價格、較之上日的跌四五磅音、</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因各方大量了結而跌、繼之又因買方支持、略有回漲、收盤價格各跌二　比左右、</p>

<h3>證券　債市不易上升</h3>
<p>公債晤盤、昨日市况因浙東形勢極為嚴重、　起多頭出籠、加以四行仍未開市、空方乘機大為活動、下午一跌幾及一元、且以小價收盤、趨勢仍未見穩定、所傳美國經濟及軍火援助、尙未實施、謠言不絕、暫時仍恐未能好轉、昨上午初開、因恒康賣出、即小三角中途　泰及生興買進、丙種由五元二角半、再抬至四角、入後協興元大華叉有賣出、行市仍回至一角半、午收稍小三四角、午後謠言仍多、生典又有轉賣、聯和信孚新華及協興先後均有賣出、雖　益聯益信昌益昌先後買進、為數不湧、檯面仍係供過於求、丙種以五元一角開盤、瞬即敲破五元、於是戊種亦打破三元甲種打破四元、乙種亦打破七元、惟丁種仍未有開出、供求結果一律跌落甚厲、計小一元〇五分至一元二角半之多、今日或許有回風、成交約計二　五十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易成交大生第三廠一百五十股、價為三十一元正、</p>
<p>衆業　股市開盤略軟、嗣即回堅、成交總額不大、橡皮股較前活躍、</p>
<h3>糖市　車白糖出百元關　主因在囤戶手貨放</h3>
<p>查本市食糖存底雖屬不薄、但大部份均在囤戶手中、堅守少出、以致業內手貨反稀、故近日急遽上漲、實為上述原因之焦點、昨市漲勢更熾、蓋塲內傳說大都利於多方耳、公會劃盤現貨二四粗白九十四元三角至九十五元七角、四月底期貨初市尙平、為九十四元四角、二角、三元八角、旋又緊升至九十四元一角、六角、七角、更至九十五元三角、五角、而到六元、六元半、七元半、直達九十八元、五月十日新交易亦已開始、初為九十五元二角、四角、五角、五元、四元八角、五元四角、五角、六元、六元五角、八角、九角、七元、七元半、八元、八元半、九角、收盤竟迫近百元而有九十九元半之價、太古車白B嘜一百〇二元半、三元半、四元、四元半、DY嘜九十四元、四元半、六元HX嘜西棧九十三元五角、至九十五元、東棧九十三元半、均升四五元之譜、</p>
<h3>疋頭　不因實銷打擊　後市反見騰高</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市先跌繼回、晨開因浙東戰事激烈、實銷史受打擊、客幫及同業手貨、亟求脫手、售盤步步下落、富貴細布、最小四十六元、富貴斜紋四十元〇五角、均有小額成交、較上日每疋跌一元左右、後市突有利多消息、烚赤雙馬回漲甚銳、致結果布價又見扳高、恢復上日原盤、惟成交稀少、粗布，粗斜始終堅定、粗斜現貨依然俏俐、本街成交各布三百餘件、粵港幫辦色布、色斜等貨二百餘件、國外暹邏等地辦怡和等廠漂染布二千餘疋、</p>
<p>東布　晨市跌風殊猛、十二磅龍頭細布最小價跌至五十元〇八九角、後市因津幫及團戶搜辦、回升亦健、步漲至五十一元六角半、較上週六每疋跌一角半、四君子嗶嘰一元五角五分半左右、無甚榮辱、</p>
<h3>煤炭　囤戶趁高出籠　熟煤行情稍挫</h3>
<p>熟煤行情、欠款週因缺貨、暗盤曾抬至四百元、但日來囤戶老單、趁高出籠、已有成交、故行情頓挫、日昨同業行拆三百八十元、亦有做開、下降二十元盤子、本街門莊、篩塊每噸四百四十元、統煤四百十八元、送到容家、行槓在內、</p>
<h3>五金　　竹節鋼依然俏俐</h3>
<p>竹節鋼　竹節鋼條連日來邁進不巳、查係由某機關採辦所致、兼之該貨來源早巳不繼、應市者僅係本埠存底而巳、以致執貨者心思堅挺、標準扶搖直上、昨市每噸三分四分花色、須售三千六百元、五分至一寸粗貨、每噸亦開三千五百元、比前漲起達百元光景、</p>
<h3>糧食　米市暗盤層峯疊出　小絞米貼價一千元　原包已合一百五十六元　市面混沌更加不堪設想</h3>
<p>昨日米市烏煙瘴氣中、尤見混沌不堪、暗盤貼價巳經秘密公開、限價不獨早經打破、且似層峯疊出、愈接而愈高、小絞貼價初開六七百元、繼八九百元、最後每百包一千元、</p>

<h3>繼續厲行限制用電　逾額須六倍收費　用電分配報告商待研究　希望各類用戶盡力節減</h3>
<p>據工部局發表、本局前爲研究分配用電起見、曾特設一委員會、負責檢討並建議分配辦法、該委員會刻已繕具報告書、此項報告書、將由新董事會予以考量、查限制電力供給之任何嚴峻辦法、其影響所及、當非淺鮮、允以對於工業方面爲然、目下工業用電、的占上海電力公司產電量百分之七十二、職是之故、上項報告書、允宜加以縝密之考量、以昭愼重、</p>
<p>煤斤存底　數額日蹙</p>
<p>頃據上海電力公司報吿、目前所施行限制用電辦法、即對於每月用電在一千度以上之用戶、按其標準用電量分配百分之七十、超過此項分配量部份、按收費率三倍收費、對於節電一層、未著成效、而煤斤消耗數量、則遠比補充數量爲大、本年二月二十四日、該公司煤斤存底爲十五萬另七百噸、自於四月一日、則已减至十二萬噸左右矣、</p>
<p>超過分配　六倍收費</p>
<p>本局鑒於該公司燃料存底日益减削、而特別委員會報告書之考慮、尚需時日、爰經核准上項限制用電辦法仍繼續有效、但超過核定分配量之部份、其收費應自三倍增至六倍（按平均電價）</p>
<p>增收之款　列入準備</p>
<p>茲有鄭重聲明者、即該公司並非因此而牟利、以其增收之款項、將列入燃料準備金項下、用於最有利於用戶之種種方面、例如用以購置售價奇昂之煤斤、此種煤斤、倘能獲得、可使工業繼續推進、而不致使一般不超過核定分配量之用戶、担負此柿高價煤斤之全部用費、</p>
<p>仍盼各界　設法節減</p>
<p>此外應請注意燃料供給之嚴重悄形、切盼各類川戶、盡力設法節减用電、吾則嚴厲之强迫限制辦法、將無可避免也、</p>
<p>嚴厲限制　俾收效果</p>
<p>又上海電力公　以然料匱乏、對全市用戶所需要、勢難維持、故於上月初經工部局批准公佈節减電流辦法、詛實施迄今、非特節减甚微、未達預期目標、而燃料供應、難經迭决設法疏通船隻、亦無效果、該公司存煤上月原有十五萬噸、係備作緊急時期之用、但爲維持其消費之不足、每月須動用二萬五千噸、故目下巳减少至十二萬噸、致該公司之燃料狀况、較上决减電時已愈益嚴重、該公司研究節電專鬥委員會遂研究進一步之限制用電辦法、業經繕具建議書、呈遞工部局考核、局方亦鑒於事態之嚴重、爲圖早日予以施行起見、當於上星期之董事會中將該項建議書之一部、先行通過、決定於本月二十四日起實行、屆時用戶消費電量超過二千度之數目者、將照六倍電價取費、俾獲嚴厲限制之效果、</p>
<p>限制用電　新訂辦法</p>
<p>昨日上午十時三十分、上每電力公司總裁霍金斯氏、在南京路總寫字間六樓、招待各報記者發表節電新辦法之文告如下、「前由上海工部局核准、凡逾額用電三倍取費、以期限制用電、俾得在此緊急期內、節省燃料、現查此項辦法、未能達到目的、燃料之消耗、超過其補充量甚鉅、茲以情勢緊急、在特別委員會之建議案討論期間、上海工部局業經核准下列辦法、卽日施行、並廢除以前之一切通告、（一）各用自民國二十九年一月份起至三十年一月份止、每月之標準用電量在一千度以上者、應於公司下决抄表之决日起、每月只得使用　標準用電量之百分之七十、照通行之電價取費、如該百分之七十用電量不滿一千度時、則以一千度爲最低限額、（二）十開限額以外之用電、應以平均電價之六倍取費、換言之、卽限額以外用電之電費、應以電費　額除用電總度數（以現行電價計算）所得之平均電價之六倍取費、（三）用戶之每月標準用電量在一千度或一千度以下者、如在任何月份內超過一千度時、其超過部份、應以首先一千度所取平均電價之六倍取費、（四）上開（二）（三）兩項內增收電費之用意、係在限制用電及節省燃料、本公司並不因此而獲利、所有收入、除以通行電價所取者外、概歸入「燃料節省準備項下、將來由工部局與本公司議定、用於有利於用戶之用途、（五）至另行通告時止、所有大量或普通（小量）電力供電之申請無論其新裝或添裝、本公司概不接受、（六）在此燃料緊急期內、深望各大小用戶、儘量節省用電爲要」、</p>
<h3>實銷呆滯　紗廠減工</h3>
<p>本市棉紗業、戰後曾盛極一時、自去年五月二日風潮發生後、市價在跌、投機者莫不受嚴重打擊、近來市價雖漸見起色、惟實銷呆滯、發生過剩之現象、且上海電力公司以海外形勢甚劣、恐燃料來源發生問題、故紗廠家擬减工二成、產量將减少而實銷依然呆滯、</p>
<h3>南京路車輛擁擠的一角</h3>
<p>公共租界內各馬路上，行人擁擠，車輛交通頻繁，市政當局常認爲很難解決的一件麻煩事情。我們只要看這最熱鬧的南京路，在大新公司門口，靠北面爲公共汽車站，南首便是　車站。有時（如圖中所示）接連着的一排雷車汽車或公共汽車開來，好像一列火車，掛有十數節車輛。行人如欲穿過馬路往往等待得不耐煩起來呢。（焦超攝）</p>
<h3>浙東　華軍雲集　紹興日熱大挫　寗波遭炸死亡尚少　去電詢問無回覆</h3>
<p>據咋日浙東消息、侵入紹興之日軍、閃遭華方猛烈襲擊、已有敗退之象、據非正式關係方面傳出、華軍已克服紹興、確否待證、寗波局勢、目前亦非常混沌、據稱、此番日機在甬施行虹炸物實損　甚重、惟人民多　遷避四鄕、死亡尚少、劇寗波同鄉會負責人稱、前日上午起（即十九日）、同鄉會發甬電報、迄今尚無覆電、大的彼處情况、更見嚴重、</p>
<p>寗波混亂　溫州巷戰</p>
<p>據大光社記者昨晚向浙省旅滬團體探悉、關於浙東　况、（一）鎭海口外日軍、自於十九日淸晨在鎭海以東望海山。金鷄山等地强行登陸後、當地駐軍即予迎擊、日軍、並藉砲火掩護增援、突入寗波、（二）在海門登陸日軍、經華軍迎戰遭挫後己派艦增援二千人續犯黃岩、（三）在瑞安及半浦登岸日軍、於十九日下午在溫州城內、展開激烈巷戰、（四）海門臨海諸曁亦均失守、</p>
<p>溫甬人心　頗為鎭定</p>
<p>據大通社記者分向浙省旅滬團體探悉、（一）浙東沿海象山縣南之石沛、黃岩以上之海門、溫州以北之瑞安、及鎮海等處、自被日艦派兵强行登陸後、當地駐軍即分頭迎擊、雙方正激戰中、（二）由三江城南犯之日軍、自於十七日入紹興後、當晚續向西南劉公埠進攻、刻仍激戰中、（三）旅滬團體昨曾分電寗波溫州詢問詳情、惟迄未獲覆、據私人方面接獲電告、當地情形已趨混亂、機關團體均遝鄕間辦公、居民亦紛向鄕郊疏散、惟因鎭海會於去年一度淪陷、居民飽經驚擾、故人心尚屬鎭定、</p>
<p>電訊中斷　郵包暫停</p>
<p>本埠美商通訊社及大北。太平洋等各電訊機關、對發往寗波·鎭海·海門·永嘉（溫州）等地之電報、業於昨日起停止拍發、惟金華等地、則仍維持暢通、上海郵政管理局已定於今日起、暫定收寄浙東福建·江西三省市大宗小包郵件、該局小包郵件封發組咋已繕發公告云、「茲因運輸困難、所有寄往福建江西之大宗小包郵件、及其經運者、定於本月廿二日起暫停收寄、又關於浙東各地大宗小包郵件、亦於是日起暫停收寄、又自滬寄往上述各地之普通掛號快郵曁名信片、現仍照常收寄、郵滙亦照常開發、嗣後可無虞中斷、</p>
<p>重要公路　破壞無遺</p>
<p>據熟悉浙東形勢者告大光社記者稱、自日方宣佈封鎖沿海後、浙東各地早失其經濟價値、且照目前戰局觀察、更無軍事價値可言、又浙省除沿海一帶外、四明·括蒼·天台等諸山脈盤桓、地勢崇高險要、且華軍早已將各重要公路破壞無遺，故日軍企圖窺伺深入、難達目的、</p>
<h3>勞働節　全市工友加緊生產　資方亦宜自動加薪</h3>
<p>五月一日國際勞働節轉瞬即屆、滬市勞慟界是日循例休假一天、以表慶祝、惟以時値非常、並不舉行任何集會、即慶祝形式、亦避免鋪張、全市工友爲發揚勞慟節意義、決努力本位、本勞資協調精神、加緊生產、同時各業資方、在此物價反常、工人生活艱難之秋、亦當自動在可能範圍、盡量改善工人待遇、以减除工人生活痛苦、是日兩租界當局、並定實施嚴密戒備、以防止不良份子謀爲不軌、而維公衆安寗、</p>
<h3>工部局臨時董事會　一時尙難實現　正待重慶國民政府決定</h3>
<p>工部局臨時董事會、雖於日前由納粹人特別大會通過產生、但昨日仍在等候重慶國民政府之決定、重慶方面之態度究竟如何、一時尚無從確悉、據消息靈通方面指出、有關係各方面均巳同意所謂國際之善意與合作之臨時董事會、目下最後之決定、爲重慶方面之態度、據稱、有關係方面、現正與重慶方叫進行談判、預料國民政府、不久將有宜言發表、</p>
<p>關於各國　仍未批准</p>

<h3>昨日中南飯店內　厲鼎模遭槍殺　步上扶梯突遭阻擊斃命　兇手圖逃被捕擊傷臀部</h3>
<p>愛多亞路東新橋畔中南飯店內、於昨日下午四時四十五分許、突發生一槍殺案、被害者厲鼎模、在銀行界供職、兇手一人、當逃至廣東路福建路口就擒、茲將各情探誌於决、</p>
<p>彈穿胸背　立是斃命</p>
<p>愛多亞路五六〇號中南飯店、於昨日下午四時十五分、來一顧客身御蓋綢袍、足登黃皮鞋、由盤梯上樓、至一樓轉灣時、詎背後尾隨數人、不問情由、即出盒子他向其轟擊一槍、斯時該男子倉卒間躱避不及、被彈中後背、貫穿前胸、應聲倒地、因傷及耍害、立時斃命、</p>
<p>狂奔逃逸　印捕緊追當出事時、該飯店正顧客盈門、熙攘往來，驟聞槍聲一響、各旅客五相奔避、兇手見目的己達、即混入人叢中、奔出大門圖遁、當有一印捕巡邏經過、瞥見該兇手拔步飛跑、知非善類、乃在後追捕、一面並在吹警笛、緊隨不捨、當逃至湖北路、折入廣東路時、印　開放三槍、均未命中、</p>
<p>扭住兇手　並加槍擊</p>
<p>其時兇手執有槍械、開放一槍拒捕、因子彈軋住、無法開放、未幾、越至廣東路福建路口八十九號震　祥烟紙舖門首、適有成都路捕房落差華捕第四五四號途經該處、目擊一切、即奮勇上前、將其攔腰抱住、撳摔倒地、隨後之印捕、乃趕上開放一槍、一中其右手姆指、一射傷其臀部、手中所執之槍械、遂被華捕所得、</p>

<h3>米價昨又飛漲　投機營業米價愈抬愈高　整頓米市不能再事因循</h3>
<p>昨日米市、在投機份子操縱下、情况殊爲混亂、無稽謠傳、層出不窮、致每石價格、較上周飛漲三四元之鉅、而違法份子、自下午私做交易後、又被抬高元許、致昨日一日間、猛漲達四五元之鉅、</p>

<h3>四行與警務處　談判安全問題　中國銀行職員辭職說不確</h3>

<h3>滙豐銀行年會報告　遠東商業金融大勢</h3>
<p>中國政府維持幣信可稱奇積　各國貨款經濟援華頗堪滿意</p>
<p>英商匯豐銀行於一九四一年二月二十六日在港舉　年會，由主席貝得森Hon．　lr．J．I．Paterson報告該行一九四〇年業務、及遠東商業金融大勢、茲由新聲社記者探得原文摘錄於後、</p>
<p>滬港商務　繼續進展</p>
<p>遠東時局發展、恰與兩三年前縝審之觀察家預言吻合、障礙橫生、商務大受影響、然樂覜者固大可宣稱、商務實未如政治發展所預示之惡劣、悲觀主義與樂觀主義者各有其理、諸位若回憶前數屆主席之演詞、將驚異常用之「空前困難」「逆轉形勢」「非常狀態」「前途無定」諸種暗淡詞句、然若諸位有數年居處遠東之經騐、試以二三十年前現象、與今日港滬商務及般務比較、當得港滬兩方仍能得保繼續進展之趨勢也、</p>
<p>緊急援華　頗堪滿意</p>
<p>唯一不健全之事最爲顯明、即去年滬方輸入大批土產品、多屬平時可以供給之物類、如米棉煤炭烟糖粉及人造絲、其入口總量及總値、均比一九三六年大增、該年輸入總値僅佔總入口百分之一三、一九四〇年竟增至百分之五一、在出口方面又被外來勢力所影饗、遂致對於貿易平衡、發生嚴重之後果、但中國仍繼續獲得外國之各種貸款、完成貨幣保陣及通貨管理措施之需、頗堪滿意、</p>
<p>維持幣信　可稱奇積</p>
<p>上年上海外滙市塲、一月間最高額爲英金四又三十二份之二十九便士、及美元八又十六份之一、五月間最低爲三便士及四又三十二份之三十一、全市仍擺動於此兩數之間、年底收市匯率的爲三又一份之一便士及五叉二份之一美元、平衡匯兌基金繼續於必要時執行平衡工作、觀乎非淪陷區與淪陷區之出口貿易、大半予以統制、是則國幣價之能維持而少困難、可稱奇蹟、</p>
<p>依法定率　付償外債</p>
<p>中國關稅收入、或爲一般未嘗細心研究　實況者所滔滔稱道、其數字雖達法幣四萬七千五白萬元、然以本年平均滙率伸算、僅値七百七十五萬鎊而已、反觀前年收入、不過法幣三萬三千一百萬元、即等於八百二十五萬鎊、然在中日戰爭前之十年間、每年平均未少過一千九百萬鎊者、此外又因中日戰事之延續、去年外債市况、無從轉好、對於關餘鹽餘借款、國民政府已令中央銀行依規定滙率付償、付償外債之撥存款項、照最初法定滙率一先令二又四份之一便士仲算、</p>
<p>梅樂和氏　監督海關</p>
<p>據上屆主席之估計、正金銀行之關餘存款達三萬八千萬元、以目前論、其數字當已倍增、倘正金銀行放案中國政府所規定之滙率、此誠爲滙兌上之問題、亦即如何獲得所需要之外滙問題、無論如何、事變前所發之外債、不容抵賴、故此滙兌問題、旣非中國亦非淪陷區統制關餘當局所能解決、祗有俟諸世界恢復常態之日、債票持有人所屬望者、爲總稅稅務司梅樂和爵士、仍繼續監督海關行政、幸而成續斐然、將來承平之時、當更有所成就、可無疑議、</p>
<p>時局復常　收回債款</p>
<p>中國各種鐵路借款、　有北寗鐵路（即一八九九年京奉鐵路金公債）、至今仍能依期付償、而營業收益頗佳、東北當局因難於獲得　滙、英籍職員雖照常受薪、在待遇上無疑的菲薄、因此甚感不滿、華西方面之進展、乃昆明西北鐵路之初步築成、但因滇越交通之隔離、此運輸笨重材料之僅有路綫、遂告中斷、衡陽之湘桂鐵路與隴海綫西段工程在進行中、鐵路受日公司之管轄者、在江南一帶爲華中公司、河北一帶爲華北公司、似乎照常通車、稍有收入、惟債票持有人、非俟諸政治局面復常後、恐難收回債款、</p>
<p>吾人期望　維持秩序</p>
<p>自內地限制中國人主要食糧及其他土產運滬後、此爲外滙低跌之劣因素、驟令生活程度、比諸一九四〇年元月上昇百分之五〇、米價增高百分之一二〇、比諸一九三七年中日戰爭爆發時、劇增百分之六〇〇、因此、自然引起各物之成本增高、支出亦要併增、遂陷工部局財政於拮据之境、余恐上海問題之根本解決、非俟諸遠東政治問題之解決不可、當前吾人所期望者、惟有各本人道主義、維持和平秩序、以保上海市民生命之安全而已、</p>

<h3>怎樣研究物理學（二）</h3>
<p>— 徐子威</p>
<p>（三）加意課後的複習「日習則學不忘」、「溫故而後知新」、都是古有的敎訓、我們在課內所習得的知識、若不於課後隨時加以複習、則必致漸趨生疏、且物理學是具有連續性的科學、前面所己學的、日積月纍地荒廢、則學到後面有聯繫的地方、無疑的就要發生不懂的困難情形了、况物理學旣然是很難理解的學科、則就課內所受得的知識未必會完全沒有疑惑不解的地方、若不是於課後經一番複習、將無從知道何處己明白、何　猶未明瞭則需要詢問、許多誠者、每感覺物理學愈讀愈難、其實不盡然、大都是由於缺少複習的功夫、致前　未能純熟、因之發生這種影響而已、</p>
<p>（四）養成好問的習慣　學與問是相輔而行的、「好問則裕」、「不恥下問」、都是古時勸學多問的敎訓、物理學旣然是很難懂解、則我們研究物理學、即使在課內能靜心聽講、在課後能廣博參考、也必有許多疑難不明白的地方、耍解決這些問題、當然惟有出諸詢問的一途、或向師長請敎、或和同學互相切磋、要不厭求詳的問、務求達到確實瞭解而後已、不問則敎者不知讀者不懂　所在、而讀者遂無以解決自己所不明、所以研究物理、遇着難和不解的應隨即問、要不憚問、不厭問、養成好問的習慣、</p>
<p>（五）詳解練習的問題　習題所以輔助學習、增進瞭解程度、啟發和訓練思想的、有多多演習的必要、很多物理問題、在驟然間看米、茫然莫解、感覺困難、但若經一番思考、每會迎刃而解的、因此演習物理問題、必須多方推考思索、不宜稍覺有些不懂遽加詢問、圖解、可使問題內容淸晰　出、引導思考於有綫索的解析途徑、所以演解若干物理問題、最好先作一簡單的圖解來幫助思路、若是遇淸極難解的問題、最好先翻閱參考書籍、總以自動求解爲主、至於爲求閱查的便利、說明耍詳密、計算要精確、寫錄要淸楚、這無待言了、</p>

<h3>長生不老</h3>
<p>— 蕭雲</p>
<p>貪生怕死，也許是人類的一種天性。古時獨裁者秦始皇的求長生不老藥，可說是人類愛生慾望的代表；據說現代的獨裁者墨索里尼也很怕老，他不喜歡人家提起他的生辰，他禁止報紙刊載他生孫于的消息，他時常表演騎馬跳欄來表示他並不老。如果這些傳聞是確實的話，那　概就是所謂「英雄所見略同」的了。</p>
<p>最近劇美國布魯克林工藝學院馬立索夫博士（D．WM．Malisoff宣佈，人類的壽命，有增加到一百八十五歲的可能。他現在正在試用種名叫Sodium　thioeyate的化學品飼養兎子，據說己經可以克服兎子衰老的象徵了，因爲這種化學品有分化兎子體中的審素膽汁精的功能。據他說，膽汁精是人類血管中的一種蠟狀物，一個人的年紀越老，他的血管中的膽汁精就越多。如果我們能將人體中的膽汁精分解起來，人類的壽命也許就可以延長了。</p>
<p>當這　球的大部遍佈烽火的時候，當這多數的國家陷入於戰爭狀態中的時候，當這黷武中義的侵略者正在以大砲炸彈竭力促短多數靑年的壽命的時候，科學家却在孜孜不倦地從事於延長人類　命的研究，這是幅多麽深刻的諷刺畫面啊！</p>
<p>世界雖是陰霾密佈，科學進步的曙光却還是在暗中不斷地增强着。祇是人類必須獲取歷史的敎訓，必須善用科學，也必須善用他們的壽命。</p>

<h3>彭丁博士死了</h3>
<p>— 莫名</p>
<p>一九四一年二月二十一日，一個科學界的旦人隨着一架失事的巨型機殞落在紐芬蘭島東海岸的鼠墳港附近。這個巨人就是鼎鼎大名的彭丁（F．G．Banting）博士—發現島精（Insulin）的醫學家，全世界糖尿病人的再生父母，一個人類的眞正造福者。</p>
<p>他的噩耗震動了全世界的每一個角落，使千萬糖尿病的息者爲之掩面悲泣。二十年前，彭丁傳士在加拿大多倫多大學研究院中埋首苦幹，要從動物胰臟中的「蘭氏小　」提取消耗血糖必需的內分泌素—　精。經過無數决的失敗，他的苦心孤詣終於獲得了空前的成功·一九二二年。彭丁博士提製的鳥精首决被正式試用於一個奄奄垂斃的病孩，於是人類史上第一個糖尿病人被人類自己的力量所救活了。彭丁的名字像今天他的噩耗那樣地震動着全世界；醫師歌頌着，病人歡笑着。他不朽的功績迅速地獲得了至高的評價和尊崇—他和他的老師麥理和（J．J．RMacleod）敎授分得了一九二三年度的諾貝爾醫學生理獎金。</p>
<p>彭丁博士是一個卓越的外科手術家，但他對各部門基本的醫學有着更深切的愛好。他的求知慾是無窮盡的，他有驚人的天才和豐富的精力，足以克服研究上的仟何困難。二十一個世界各地科學團體的會員和榮譽會員，十一决學術獎金和獎章，五所著名大學的名譽博士學位，這許多光榮的　錄成爲他偉大和成功的標識。加拿大政府又於一九二三年起特贈他年俸七千五百元，以示國家對科學家勛勞的獎勵和表彰。但彭丁博士談於名利，他自動把諾貝爾獎金分給和他一同研究島精的倍斯特（C．H．Bcst博士共享，並把自己所得的一萬元美金捐充「彭丁醫學研究基金」，設立一個「彭丁研究院」，廣泛地發動進步醫學的研究工作。世界上再沒有比這種『投資』更有意義的「企業」了。它的「利息」是　世界人所共享的，而且永久地爲我們萬世子孫所共享的。</p>
<p>彭丁博士是一個入世的科學家，他時時刻刻惦念着痛苦的大衆，他允愛他的祖國和人類的正義。第一决世界大戰時，他出生入死於戰塲，替傷兵幹辛苦的服務工作。本决歐戰發生後，他奉命專力於研究航空醫學。但是當他負着重大的軍事使命首途飛英時，竟不幸　志以歿。我們不能不認他是間接地被侵略的凶熖所殺害的。還是正當五十歲的有爲盛年呢！這對人類眞是一個重大的打擊和損失。</p>
<p>我們要貫澈造婦人羣的工作來紀念彭丁博士。這裏摘錄他的幾句名言作爲我們座右之銘：「人心是絕不能滿足的，吾則世界就要停止進步了。人生最大的樂事就是工作。這應當是獲取，不是佔有；應當是拖捨，不是保守，我相信你能做你所希望的任何事情，假使你有犧牲的決心，你能思考，而且你能堅苦地，不斷地工作。』</p>

<h3>嘔閒氣</h3>
<p>— 一志</p>
<p>母親近來會用細心眼兒注意爸爸，無論吃烟，跑路，坐，立，似乎件件般般都使她生氣，爸爸的一切，她似乎都不滿意，終日氣鼓噓噓，簡直像寃家對頭，一步不肯放鬆。</p>
<p>滿養很　的爸爸，任何事能忍受，而母親的緊迫，也會氣得他暴跳如雷。</p>
<p>每天，兩人往往爲一件小事，會吵了起來，結果，母親老是睡在床上哭泣，爸爸唉聲嘆氣。</p>
<p>任何事總會引起吃的問題來，「吃」是二人吵鬧的主要原因。</p>
<p>「米糧一天天漲上去，要愁着怎樣飽肚子，還要嘔這閒氣，照這樣子，我早就說了，遲早準會大家餓故！」</p>
<p>「你存着好心眼兒，只希望大家餓……幾天無烟吃你就會一百個不舒服。………」</p>
<p>「除非來啃我老骨頭！」</p>
<p>「小賊，一天到晚閒蕩閒蕩，人家總會外面區想想辦法，你只懶在家裹踱東踱西！………」遇到二人爭吵哥哥也就成爲爸爸的出氣洞。</p>
<p>「你羨慕人家嗎？我們祖上並未作孽，還不致於要出賣祖宗……</p>
<p>「你管束得好，你敎訓得好兒子，我這樣年紀，本來該享享福了，現在我要吃飯，我要吃烟……」</p>
<p>「他沒有做賊，沒有做盜……！不致辱沒了你，老的不去領導，叫小的去亂撞？老不知恥！」</p>
<p>「老了不中用了！要他們尋飯我吃」砰的把檯子一拍，眼裹要冒出火來。</p>
<p>於是，母親　懦怯地流淚—哭了。</p>
<p>兩人幾天內不瞅不睬，但母親暗地裹仍在注意爸爸，一捉住間隙，又吵起來了。</p>
<p>啊　從前爸爸種着園地，母親帝領着孩子，哥哥經營着爸爸交替的事業，我上着學我的家是融融洩洩的樂園。是誰强佔了家園，是誰搶去了事業，是誰攪得父母勃谿時起？現在，融和歡樂，與我的家，離得遠遠地，遠遠地，不知去向，祇滿罩着黑暗，愁慘。</p>
<p>盡着我無上的努力，我相信那失區的融和與歡樂，不久仍會給我追尋回來的。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（七）臉上劃一個十字</p>
<p>秋海棠一看見他，身子便不由冷了半截。前個月他到天津，雖已遵着湘綺的囑咐，竭力拒絕了他决要求，但心裹便添了一重極大的心事，他知道這個性子又險又韌，活像一條毒蛇一樣的傢伙是決不肯放過他的。湘綺信裹儘管說不久就要我個機會，向袁寶藩進言，要他把季兆雄停歇出去，並且可嚀他無論如何不許再借錢給季兆雄。可是他那一張祇剩皮不見肉的臉一出現，秋海棠的心裹便立刻寒起來了。</p>
<p>「…我已經好久不……不……出台……，自己手裹也……也……窘得很呢……！」他放下了手裏的報紙，勉强吞吞吐吐地說。</p>
<p>季兆雄的兩個三角眼只一轉，便知道他心裹有些胆怯，同時這幾天他也的確太需要錢了，便決定不顧一切，破例的對他硬一次試試看</p>
<p>「眞人面前別說假話，吳老板！」只一秒鐘工夫，他己鐵靑着險，換了極强硬的口氣了。「有道是與人方便，自己方便。你別小看了我季兆雄，老實說，問你借錢還是客氣的：惹得我翻了臉，你便是用鈔票把我包起來，我眼裹也不會當你是一個人咧！」</p>
<p>這一來季兆雄的算計可完全錯了，秋海棠生平所最怕的就是人家對他一味父軟又皮賴的厮缠，像這樣硬撞硬挺，結果反會把他的拗性勾起來的。</p>
<p>「你說話太不客氣了！」原是垂下的頭突然抬了起來，眼請直接看定了季兆雄。「別說我不欠你的錢。就是欠的話，你這樣對付我，我也不能還你！」（八七）</p>

<p>新片介紹</p>
<h3>「舊歡新寵」</h3>
<p>— 鄧士英</p>
<p>論故事，「舊歡新寵」是好萊塢在去年大量攝製的「艷情喜劇」中的一個。這一類故事，偶一看到，也許會感到一點興趣，看得多了，便會殺膩。何況編劇者手法有高下，同型的戲一多，就有比較，比較之下，高矮立見，於是乎就更難矣。到現在為止，所謂「艷情喜劇」，祗有一　「多夫實鑑」給人留下一點較深的印象，便是因此。不過「舊歡新寵」也有其使人注意之道。此無他，在乎演員。凱絲玲赫小和我們久遠了，此人而孔雖不漂亮，演起戲來，那些照片明星却是遠不能及的；詹姆斯史都華在過去如「民主萬歲」等片子給人印象極好，本片是他得本屆男星演技最佳金像獎的，使人注目更是必然。卡萊葛偷，在「多夫實鑑」等片子中都有他，是演「艷情喜劇」的老手了，當然也要看看他。</p>
<p>看了回來，却覺得：凱絲玲赫本是好的，但不夠勁，「艷情喜劇」之對她，不大調和，不夠放和不夠熱：詹姆斯史斯革那種「多情的傻瓜」樣子，還是依舊，雖說對性格的統一控制得很強固（這也許就是得金像獎的理由），是其可取之處，但我終覺得他之得金像獎的作品，應該是「民主萬歲」而不是本片。卡萊葛倫則爲了劇本關係，給人印象無「多夫實鑑」諸片之深。</p>
<p>談到劇本，我覺得本片祗有小聰明而不夠充實全局，若干精彩處在對白而不在畫面，也不是挺好的辦法。「艷情喜劇」固然是小聰明的堆積，但這應如化學而不是算學。</p>
<p>導演者的功過與編劇上差不多。小的取方所可取者，是照相機的運用，這種利用小道具做戲，元也是近來好萊塢影片的特點之一，在本片中，則利用很多，並且大都很好。至於開場時屈蘭仙勞德士脫赫文離婚時所配鼓聲及屈蘭仙大醉去前喝酒時所配的效果，也是其聰明處。這種卡通化的效果，在中國影片中則是看不到，聽不到的。</p>

<h3>「洪宣嬌」的製作</h3>
<p>— 鄧嘯</p>
<p>關於「洪宣嬌」的演出，評者已多，我祗從史料方面，略加評介。作者魏如晦是據作家，同時又是考據家，因此他的「洪宣嬌」處處都是根據史實編成的。大約他頗搜集了不少晚清的書報雜誌。這當中大部分是有民族思想的，當然談到太平天國的文章很多。如他所舉宣嬌篇傳記，我　一篇也不會看過，都是罕見的。他進來「目錄學」的興味甚好，宇宙風和學林上，都有或將有他的此類作者發表。那末，何妨像「海國英雄」說明書那樣，將洪宣嬌所　根據的材料寫成一個目錄發表呢？例如如何介紹基道州戲地圖，程文相修史，戈登與李開芳晤談，傳散祥的　文章等等，都是珍貴而有興味的材料。</p>
<p>我明知道的很少。第一幕四王等旗幟似據凌善清「太平天國野史」製成，上面的字原為直式，想為夫關之故。洪大全的部份似腳謝與蕘「太平天國野史事論襲」中的天德王洪大全傳，中有云：「既至京師，拘於刑部，部吏訊之，堅不吐實。與言太平天國事，辄不語，旋被磔於市。」又云：「太平軍少初起也，似分為複明與耶教二派，複明派以洪大全為首領，耶教派以楊秀清為首領。」有據野史洪大全傳：「臨刑日，又大全高誦司室表聖句日：漢兒盡作胡兒語，爭向城頭罵漢人。」按此一語即晚書田空圖七絕「河湟有感」，原詩云：「一自蕭關起戰塵，河湟割斷異鄉春。漢兒學得胡兒語，却向城頭嗎漢人」。我坐在末排，不會聽得清楚，似以此詩為宋兀之文人作；如果不會聽錯，似應加以改正。</p>
<p>第一幕對聯，我因坐得太遠，也不會看清楚。野史卷上頁六一和六二錄有聯語，不知是否以此為根據。</p>
<p>第五幕李秀成口誦「英雄自古披肝膽，壯士何嘗惜羽毛！」當乃根據羅邕等「太平天國詩文鈔」中李作感事二首中的警句。</p>
<p>對我此很感興味，希望如晦能夠滿足我開列目錄的要求</p>

<h3>British Newspaper Comments on the Sino-Japanese War</h3>
<p>London: The Times published an editorial entitled "China Continues to Fight," which stated:</p>
<p>The war in China is now entering its fifth year, and many misconceptions about China are gradually being dispelled. The most erroneous of these misconceptions is the idea that China cannot resist modern mechanized armies like the Japanese army. By Western military standards, the training, equipment, and staff work of the Chinese army are largely inadequate. Although it has inflicted some significant blows on the Japanese army, its strategic retreat since the fighting in Shanghai has often given people a different impression. However, its unwavering strategy has trapped over a million Japanese troops on the battlefield for four years. Although the Japanese continue to claim victory, they are in fact admitting their failure. Did the Japanese not say that the war against China could be ended in four weeks? Now, after four years of hard fighting, there is still no end in sight. The Japanese also have a delusion that the Chinese have never had national unity and that China is not a nation but merely a geographical term. However, although the Japanese have temporarily achieved some results by sowing the seeds of political division among the opposing factions during China's internal strife, they have ultimately been disappointed to see the unity of their military leaders in resisting foreign aggression. The Japanese are gradually feeling the harsh lessons in their efforts to blockade China. In theory, the entire Chinese coastline from the Bohai Bay in the north to the Tokyo Bay in the south is blockaded. However, in reality, as soon as the Japanese plug one gap, another leak immediately appears, like a leaky belt. The recent attacks suffered in the North Sea have indeed dealt a significant blow to the Chinese, disrupting their lines of communication and destroying valuable supplies. At the same time, the bombing of the Mekong River bridge on the Burma Road has not compensated for the loss of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. However, various supplies continue to flow into the Chinese interior from sources that the Japanese cannot hope to blockade. If the Japanese want to implement a complete blockade in the current situation, they must station a soldier every six yards along the coastline from the border of Manchuria to Vietnam. Even if this were possible, it would not be effective where there is a strong incentive to smuggle Japanese goods. The Japanese hope that the isolated government in Chongqing will only be a partial regime has also been shattered. When the Burma Road was previously blockaded, Chongqing received very little supplies. However, the reopening of the Burma Road, the loans from Britain and the United States to China, the visit of Coulee to China, and President Roosevelt's promise of aid have greatly encouraged the capital. China initially fought for its own sake and for the sake of Western democracies. This is now universally recognized. China now hopes to receive more supplies so that it can not only counter-attack the invaders but also secure its position in the overall world settlement. After all, China's future peace and security depend on the overall world settlement.</p>
<p>Chinese leaders are now discussing their difficulties and dangers with candor. This is one of the many changes that have occurred in China's four years of war. The authorities in Chongqing are now openly discussing the difficulties of high prices, shortages of goods, and this year's poor harvests in the inland provinces, as well as the Japanese disruption of the Chinese currency system, without the slightest concealment. They may also be considering the obstacles to the transportation of goods on the Burma Road. The appointment of Mr. Keith, a key figure in the American Red Cross in China, as Chairman of the Management Committee of this road is indeed a major step in the right direction. The many difficulties encountered by the Chongqing authorities are vast in scope and complex in nature. If another country were in this situation, it would be considered hopeless. However, the Chinese have proven in these four years that they know how to struggle and survive. This characteristic has been acquired through centuries of adaptation to various environments. Although the Japanese people's feelings about Chairman Chiang Kai-shek vary from time to time, his courage and perseverance have always been admired by the Japanese, even though they harbor frivolous hopes that his health may gradually decline, his followers may become scattered, and that he may go to the United States for rest and recuperation. They have never used derogatory language to describe him, as they acknowledge the greatness of his personality. The main support of China today and the main hope for its future lie in this greatness of personality. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, although bearing arduous and relentless hardships, remains in good health and high spirits. This is truly a blessing for China. It seems that nothing can make him cower, and nothing can shake his confidence in China's future. He has the characteristics to inspire the whole country with his own beliefs. Mr. Guo Taiqi recently said in London, "China has Chiang Kai-shek, just as Britain has Churchill and the United States has Roosevelt." Indeed, the future of human freedom depends first and foremost on these three leaders. Although Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's connection to national security is not as obvious as that of the British Prime Minister and the American President in the eyes of the world, its importance may be even greater. After all, the future of China's 450 million people can currently be entrusted to no one other than Chiang Kai-shek. Even his opponents know that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will not give up the struggle until the Japanese withdraw from China. Churchill said of Britain's main enemy that the war was launched by Hitler, but it cannot be ended by Hitler or his successors. The Chinese people feel the same way about the Japanese. Today, people are gradually realizing that one country can launch a war, but it takes two or more countries to make peace. (Reuters Telegram dated the 21st)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Nature of the Zhejiang-Fujian Battles</h3>
<p>In the past four or five days, Japanese forces have suddenly launched offensives against various coastal counties in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces; either forcibly landing under the cover of naval artillery fire, or launching attacks into the hinterland preceded by aerial bombings, or advancing southward from their strongholds on the southern bank of the Qiantang River. According to various sources, the areas affected by these Japanese disturbances include Shaoxing, Zhuji, Zhenhai, Linpu, Shibu, Haimen, and Ruian in Zhejiang; and Zhangyuan in Changle, and Daxiaao and Xiaoxiaoao at the mouth of the Lianjiang River in Fujian. As of the time of this writing, there are even reports that Japanese troops have captured Xiangbo and Wenzhou, resulting in street fighting. We deeply sympathize with the heavy casualties and destruction of prosperous production areas in the densely populated areas affected. However, recalling that at the beginning of the full-scale war four years ago, the Chinese government and people had already anticipated that the country would have to endure tragic sacrifices, and that the coastal and riverine provinces and counties would be the first to suffer this calamity. The fact that Zhejiang and Fujian have remained intact as a war zone for four years until today was not unexpected from the beginning, especially at this moment!</p>
<p>The simultaneous and multi-pronged attacks by the Japanese navy, army, and air force in Zhejiang and Fujian, seem to mimic Germany's blitzkrieg tactics. However, this is not the case. The essence of blitzkrieg tactics is the speed of movement and the concentration of combat power on a single focal point of the enemy's strength. It targets the enemy's vital points that must be defended, bypassing strong defenses, using the principle of converging from multiple directions, and launching a deadly blow with a fierce attack. Due to the high level of application and development of these essential elements, Germany has successively achieved extraordinary victories in Eastern Europe, Northern Europe, Western Europe, and the Balkans before today. Comparing the current Japanese military operations in Zhejiang and Fujian with the essence of the so-called blitzkrieg tactics, it is practically nine mistakes out of ten and nothing is right. It is not worthy of being regarded as blitzkrieg tactics; it is only the "sporadic movement" of the same time and the same corner.</p>
<p>In modern warfare, on the one hand, the consumption is extremely large, and no amount of materials, whether in the tens, hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands, is sufficient. On the other hand, the maintenance, development, and application of all forces related to the war must be extremely precise and strict, without the slightest sloppiness, and meticulously calculated. From this point of view, we feel that the recent battles in Zhejiang and Fujian are, in the overall situation of the Sino-Japanese War, uneconomical for both sides. The initiator of this Zhejiang-Fujian battle is extremely foolish. Because, from the Japanese perspective, the Zhejiang-Fujian situation is not enough to affect the overall situation, let alone determine the overall situation. So what is the point of seeking to resolve the so-called China Incident? Therefore, regardless of the success or failure of the Japanese army in Zhejiang and Fujian, it only increases unnecessary consumption. If measured by the meticulous maintenance and development of all forces, it is far, far away. From the Chinese perspective, the destruction and loss of a city or town, although not related to the overall situation, at least has a relationship with the life and death of tens of thousands of people, and at least has a relationship with the gain and loss of tens of thousands of assets. Therefore, from the point of view of war power, one should not despise a city or town as if it were a weed. The matter is uneconomical for both sides, but the difference lies in the significance. The initiative is the result of Japan's folly, and the reactive combat is a matter of duty. Moreover, China's basic strategy is solely to cause the other side to continue to consume more and more.</p>
<p>Some say that Japan's latest launch is not at all frivolous, but aims to blockade the sea mouths in Zhejiang and Fujian, so that China can no longer obtain overseas assistance from these sea mouths, so the significance lies in the economy, and this move is not uneconomical. In fact, Japan's blockade of the sea mouths has long been implemented, so why wait for this landing operation? The reason why these sea mouths have not been absolutely suffocated in recent years is because there has been some kind of tacit understanding between the Japanese and foreign ships, not because the Japanese army has not landed, nor because Japan's blockade is not strong enough. Moreover, the amount of materials that these sea mouths handle to and from Southeast Asia in recent years is extremely small, and it is mostly to and from Shanghai. In recent years, Shanghai has been like an isolated island to the inland, and it is no different from the exclusive market for Japanese goods. Therefore, the result of Japan's absolute blockade of the sea mouths in Zhejiang and Fujian is only to make the Japanese goods in Shanghai lose the last chance to infiltrate Free China through Zhejiang and Fujian. From this point of view, is this move economical or uneconomical?</p>
<p>As for explaining it as the aftermath of the Soviet-Japanese Pact, as a military expansion after Japan's diplomatic success, as a manifestation of promoting the solution of the so-called China Incident, such claims are also not seen to be so. After the Soviet authorities declared that the Soviet-Japanese Pact would not change their policy of assisting China, it fundamentally lost its role as a tool for Japan to conduct nerve warfare against China, let alone its other roles against China. To say that the Soviet-Japanese Pact made Japan worry-free in the north and could transfer its northern garrison for other uses is not only fundamentally questionable, but it is also impossible to transfer troops to Zhejiang and Fujian in less than ten days after the signing of the pact. It can be seen that Japan signing the Soviet-Japanese Pact is one thing in diplomacy, and launching the Zhejiang-Fujian battle is another thing in military affairs, and the two are completely unrelated. If it is said that the essence of the Soviet-Japanese Pact does not help Japan solve the so-called China Incident, but Japan can regard this pact as enriching the keynote of Japan's implementation of its so-called national policy; due to the enrichment of this keynote, Japan can recklessly disregard everything and boldly act in Zhejiang and Fujian in order to implement its original intention of conquering China by military force. No one can deny this statement on behalf of Japan. However, from a purely military perspective, from a purely military strategic analysis, in international warfare, Zhejiang and Fujian are not disputed by military strategists, and they are definitely not the decisive battlefield for the entire Sino-Japanese War. Even in the isolated corner of Zhejiang and Fujian, although the Chinese side is determined to fight anywhere and is prepared to strike at any time, the area along the coast, along the Qiantang River and Min River, such as the area recently disturbed by the Japanese army, is definitely not the battlefield chosen by China for the decisive battle. A little deeper, there are towering mountains, which are the natural graves of the invaders!</p>
<h3>US President and Canadian Prime Minister Confer on Economic Cooperation; Both Countries Resolve to Mobilize All Resources to Assist Each Other in Defending the Western Hemisphere</h3>
<p>Hyde Park: President Roosevelt and Canadian Prime Minister King agreed last night on a plan to mobilize all resources of the United States and Canada to defend the British Empire. Canada also promised to provide the United States with US$300 million worth of defense materials. According to a press release on the special meeting between the two leaders, other plans discussed by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister King included utilizing North America's production advantages in the fastest and most effective way to defend the two countries and the Western Hemisphere, and to assist Britain and other democratic countries by the US and Canada. A statement issued by the US and Canadian governments said the US and Canada mutually agreed to mobilize the continent's resources, and to mutually supply each other with defense materials that can be produced and produced quickly. The production program should also fit this objective. Although Canada has expanded production capacity several times since the start of the war, it still needs to obtain various defense materials from the United States. Canada will purchase these materials in the coming year, which will be several times more than in the past. On the other hand, Canada has the ability to quickly produce certain munitions and strategically important materials, such as lead and ships, that are urgently needed by the United States for its national defense. Although there is no precise estimate at present, it is hoped that Canada will be able to supply the United States with approximately US$200 million to US$300 million worth of these defense materials in the next twelve months. This quantity is small in the US national defense program, but many of these materials to be supplied to the United States are very important. The method of payment for the purchase of these supplies by the United States will be to use material assistance to Canada to offset the cost of Canada's purchase of goods from the United States, which is extremely important to the economic and financial relations between the two countries. Because some of the materials purchased by Canada from the country contain certain parts and materials for the equipment and munitions manufactured by Canada for the United Kingdom, the US and Canada also agreed that the United Kingdom may obtain these materials under the Lend-Lease Act, and they are allowed to be transported to Canada and included in the finished goods item. Details on technical friendship and economy will be formulated as soon as possible in accordance with the general principles agreed upon by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister King.

<p>Hyde Park: Officials here called,</p>
<p>Since the meeting between US President Roosevelt and Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King, the US and Canada have concluded an agreement to exchange national defense equipment to accelerate the defense of the Western Hemisphere and assist Britain. It is reported that Canada will supply the United States with US$300 million worth of national defense raw materials in the coming year to meet the urgent needs of the United States. US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and Hopkins both attended the meeting. Unofficial sources today predicted that Britain's setbacks in the Balkans will accelerate and increase US aid to Britain. Reliable sources said that US officials were surprised by the rapid progress of the German army. It is reported that two weeks ago, various parties assured President Roosevelt that the Allied forces of Britain, Greece, and South Africa could at least contain the German and Italian troops for four months. However, it is strongly stated that the US government still believes that Britain will achieve final victory and still exist. It is pointed out that although the British Empire is suffering a fierce blow, it has not been damaged in the slightest. (International News Agency Telegram dated the 21st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper Expresses Dissatisfaction with Vietnam</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Hochi Shimbun reported that it heard that some "mysterious" events had occurred in Vietnam. Adding to the delay in the conclusion of the Thai-Vietnamese treaty, the rapid solution of these problems will require the attention of Matsuoka after his return home. The "mysterious" events that occurred in Vietnam, according to the news received by the newspaper, are listed below: (1) Vietnamese troops are concentrated on the coast south of Phnom Penh's Chepu Village and Cochinchina. Recently, new troops have arrived from Algiers and are heading to the front lines. (2) The French Far East Fleet conducts daily exercises, and submarines from Europe participate. (3) Recently, 20 bombers were imported from the United States and have been assigned to the front lines. (4) Large numbers of troops are mobilized in Vinh, Sinlipu, Sisophon, and other places, and large troops are transferred from Pantanban to Sisophon and Mongkol Borei. (5) The Vietnamese government implements complete control over imports. (6) Oil companies in Saigon, England and the United States have refused to supply oil for Japanese ships.

<h3>Well-Known German Submarine Commanders Suffer Setbacks - One Killed, One Captured - British First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander Explains Victory in the Atlantic Naval Battle</h3>
<p>London - First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander announced yesterday that two top German submarine commanders had met contrasting fates: one was confirmed dead, and the other captured. Commander Schepke, commander of German submarine U-100, perished when his vessel was sunk. Commander Kretschmer, commander of U-99, was captured when his submarine was sunk. These two officers were among the most highly decorated in the German navy. Kretschmer was known as the "Wolf of the Atlantic" and was credited with sinking more British ships than any other of his peers. The Germans' intense admiration for these two commanders illustrates that the deployment of submarines depends on outstanding talent. Their removal is a great relief. Alexander continued, stating that enemy ships sunk, captured, or scuttled amounted to 2,250,000 tons. The Atlantic war naturally has its ups and downs, and the situation is constantly changing. However, I can state with certainty that neither German submarines nor long-range aircraft are sufficient to defeat us. The strength of our navy and coastal defense forces is steadily increasing, and through close cooperation, enemy ship losses have been substantial. Moreover, with the increase in our destroyers and light anti-submarine vessels (corvettes) – (Translator's note: a new type of lightly armed, inexpensive vessel specifically for anti-submarine warfare) – German submarine losses are sure to increase dramatically. Victory in the Atlantic war can be achieved. Furthermore, the ten new Coast Guard cutters transferred from the United States are already in service and proving highly effective, many being larger than destroyers. These ships were originally intended for coastal patrol, but it is now said that they are even more useful for hunting down German pirates in the Atlantic. (United Press dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<p>London - First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander, in a speech yesterday about the British victory in the Atlantic battle, said that the combined strength of the British Navy and Coastal Command had increased, and the number of escort destroyers and gunboats had also grown. The enemy's losses would be even heavier hereafter. The British would continue to fight until they won the Atlantic battle. "We must continue to fight, work, and struggle to restore the escort situation of the previous Great War. At that time, the British fleet was not solely responsible for the arduous task but was joined by the vast fleets of five Allied nations, with five times the number of destroyers we have today. However, the British Navy still maintains the lifeline open, which is truly remarkable. We have recently announced the capture of hundreds of enemy submarine crew members, but even more enemy submarine crew members have been buried at sea. I can guarantee that the numbers of enemy submarines destroyed reported to the Admiralty by British ship captains engaged in anti-submarine warfare are in no way exaggerated." Regarding the loan of ten U.S. Coast Guard cutters to Britain, the First Lord said that these patrol boats were mostly slightly larger than British destroyers and were originally used for customs enforcement, but he believed they were even more useful for protecting merchant ships and searching for German raiding vessels. The First Lord also said, "I see there are criticisms that the British Navy cannot prevent German and Italian reinforcements from arriving in Libya. It should be known that once we decided to provide aid to Greece, we had to undertake the significant task of sending a large number of troops and equipment to Greece. Thanks to the Navy, the troops and equipment have safely arrived in Greece. At the same time, we must continuously transport supplies to the American garrison in Libya. While some have expressed reservations about the enemy's ability to transport reinforcements, the British Navy has destroyed hundreds of thousands of tons of enemy transport ships. I believe the government's decision to assist Greece and the Navy's execution of its duties require no apology." The British Air Force bombers have given the enemy fierce counterattacks, which can be clearly seen in the German radio station's complaints about air raids after the attacks on Salonika and Piraeus, showing that the Germans disliked the air raids. The First Lord concluded, "We must continue to fight until we win the war." (Reuters dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<h3>German Planes Fiercely Bomb London - Significant Material Damage - Churches and Other Public Buildings Damaged</h3>
<p>London - Authorities, after receiving reports, recently disclosed that during the German air raids on London and its vicinity on Saturday night, thousands of incendiary bombs and large quantities of light and heavy high-explosive bombs were dropped on various districts along the Thames Estuary. The German High Command stated that this was another act of retaliation by the Germans for the British Air Force's repeated attacks on Berlin. Major fires broke out in the Thames docks, the Millwall Docks, and Greenwich. According to the U.S. Aviation Department, London suffered severe attacks with significant material damage, and casualties are expected to be high. Outside the London city center, bombs fell in the southeast, causing material damage in several locations, but few deaths or injuries. In one district of London with narrow streets and densely packed houses, buildings were damaged by bombs, while in other districts, public buildings such as hospitals, churches, and museums were also damaged. Health Minister Brown recently visited a bombed hospital, expressing admiration for the hospital staff's heroic dedication, such as a nurse who died while hurriedly rescuing ten children. A church was destroyed by incendiary bombs, but after clearing the rubble, a wedding was held in its porch yesterday. A town in East Anglia was attacked that night, with a heavier death toll than in previous raids. A district in that town that had been attacked several times was bombed again, suffering considerable damage. In many places in the southeast, hundreds of incendiary bombs were dropped in rural areas. Saturday night's bombing was the most intense that various small towns in East Anglia and near London had experienced in previous raids. (Reuters dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<p>London - An air raid warning was issued in London last night, lasting for a short time. As of late at night, there were no reports of bombs falling anywhere in Britain after dusk.

<h3>Geographic Research Institute Organizes Fujian Survey Team</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The human and natural groups of the Chinese Geographic Research Institute set off last winter to survey the Jialing River basin and Hanzhong, respectively, conducting very detailed research on the natural economy and land use of each region. Recently, they discovered a very complete glacial landform at the top of Bashan Mountain, covering an area of 300 square kilometers, which is a remarkable discovery for the geological community. Recently, in view of China's vast coastline, and that the ocean is not only important for national defense and transportation, but also a major resource for economic construction, in order to understand the detailed situation along China's coast, the institute's ocean group organized a Fujian survey team, scheduled to depart from Chongqing on the 22nd, led by researcher Ma Tingying of the group, with the survey period tentatively set at six months.

<h3>Greece Continues to Shorten Lines - Fierce Rearguard Actions Underway - Athens Announces Fall of Larissa - German Forces Advance Westward Through the Pindus Mountains</h3>
<p>London - Recent Allied military communiqués declare that the Allied front lines in Macedonia and Thessaly have not been breached by German forces. Fierce rearguard actions are underway, and fresh Greek troops are continuing to withdraw to shorter lines. German losses are reportedly substantial, though mechanized units, infantry, and aircraft continue to arrive as reinforcements. Simultaneously, German High Command communiqués declared that German forces are now pursuing British and Greek troops across the Thessalian plain, east of the Pindus Mountains. This demonstrates that the lines held by Allied forces have been completely breached. The Germans also claimed to have captured large numbers of Greek soldiers. German air forces, having participated in the capture of Larissa, bombed and strafed retreating enemy troops. According to neutral diplomatic sources in Bucharest, Yugoslavia continues to resist, with numerous German reconnaissance units being killed by raiding parties. In the region northwest of Skopje, an armed mobile force of over 8,000 men is advancing southward, attempting to reach the Greek lines. This mobile force has also laid mines in other areas and lured enemy troops into ambushes. German losses in the area of Kacanik are estimated at 223 destroyed tanks, 9,500 dead, and 20,000 wounded. In the current situation, German forces in the south appear not only undiminished but are actually increasing their garrisons to maintain order. The former pro-Axis Prime Minister Zivkovic was reportedly seriously wounded when Belgrade was bombed. (Reuters dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<p>Berlin - German pilots reported yesterday that British forces were retreating towards Lamia, which is near the site of the historically significant Battle of Thermopylae. In 480 BC, Leonidas led 300 Spartan warriors in a desperate defense of the Thermopylae pass, all perishing in the process. However, the large Persian army was prevented from conquering Greece. This battlefield is only 120 miles from Athens. Berlin had long predicted that the capture of Lamia would be a significant blow to Greece. (International News Service dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<p>Berlin - German military sources report that after German forces crossed the northern Greek mountain valleys and pursued the British and Greek Allied forces, German shock troops have now crossed the Trikala-Larissa line. The road from Larissa through Lamia to Athens is a key route for retreating troops and is now under intense German air bombardment. Enemy forces on the Epirus front are retreating toward Ioannina, pursued by German and Italian air forces. (United Press dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<p>Berlin - This afternoon's German military report claimed that German forces advancing in Greece were in pursuit of the enemy beyond Larissa and heading south. Others, passing through the Pindus Mountains and advancing westward, had already occupied the key pass of Metsovo. Within Albania, Italian forces continue to advance, reaching the Greek border in several locations. German aircraft attacked British troop transports not far from the west coast of Greece. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<p>Athens - Official reports recently stated that German forces have occupied Larissa after dreadful street fighting. British forces have withdrawn to a new, shorter, and more defensible line south of this strategically important eastern city. This new line extends to the foothills, with artillery and troops already in place. It is claimed that the Germans have employed Stukas in Larissa. While German forces, amidst fierce aircraft attacks and fires, were attacking every position held by British troops with tanks and machine guns, British forces fought their way out of the city. (Associated Press dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<p>Berlin - It was announced here this morning that Führer Hitler, at a secret headquarters somewhere in the Balkans, personally commanded hundreds of German tanks rumbling down into the Thessalian plain, overrunning Larissa and Trikala, and routing the retreating British and Greek forces. It is claimed that the British forces are "in headlong retreat," clogging roads and filling the area between Larissa and Lamia, suffering heavy casualties from German air bombardment.

<p>Athens - A government spokesman stated today that due to the German advance into Macedonia, the rear and flanks of the Greek forces were under attack. Therefore, the Greek forces on the Italian front continued to make a very orderly strategic retreat yesterday. The tasks facing the Greek forces are very heavy, but all movements are proceeding smoothly and in an orderly manner. For example, in making difficult movements according to the orders of the High Command, the Greek forces not only demonstrated their bravery but also repulsed Italian forces everywhere, and sometimes even attempted counterattacks to harass them. One Italian force counterattacked with tanks, but the Greek forces repulsed them. (United Press dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<p>German Occupation of Mount Olympus - British and Greek New Line Remains Firm</p>
<p>Cairo - People here still view the Balkan war situation as serious. According to well-informed sources in Cairo, Mount Olympus, on the right flank of the Allied forces, was occupied by German forces after the British withdrawal. This was part of a pre-planned British strategy to shorten the line under heavy attacks by enemy armor and mechanized forces. Although the German forces suffered terrible losses, they continued to attack with large numbers of troops. Athens radio broadcast a Greek Information Ministry communiqué stating that the Allied forces had modified their line in several locations, but the line remained firm. The German forces were constantly attacking the entire British and Greek lines, hoping to achieve a quick and decisive victory, but they were unsuccessful. The Germans brought in more mechanized units, with infantry and aircraft constantly reinforcing them, making every effort to attack. However, the British and Greek forces, fighting bravely like lions, held their lines tightly. The Germans pressed forward densely, like a giant wave crashing in, sparing no cost to seize the passes in the Kalabaka area, but ultimately failed, suffering heavy casualties. The German attack on the Mount Olympus area also sacrificed thousands upon thousands of soldiers, yet they still failed to break through the Allied lines. The heroic deeds of the Australian and New Zealand troops there added to the glory of Mount Olympus. Furthermore, a British Air Force communiqué stated that the British Air Force continued major operations for the past two days, with considerable success. German dive bombers, protected by fighter escorts, attempted to attack British land forces and ships in the port of Chalcis but were intercepted by British fighter patrols. Yesterday, ten German aircraft of various types were shot down, and many more were severely damaged. The British fighter planes suffered no losses. Furthermore, British fighter planes severely damaged several Italian aircraft over Milos. (Reuters dispatch of the 21st)</p>

<p>British Newspapers Realistically Discuss the Situation - Withdrawal from Greece Is Inevitable</p>
<p>London - Today's newspapers commented on the situation in Greece, stating that the British Empire's forces and Greek forces are currently standing shoulder to shoulder in the world's largest defensive battle. Regarding the possible outcomes of the overall situation in Greece, all offer realistic critiques, without illusions. The newspapers highly praised the unwavering determination of the Greek forces and the spirit of the Australian troops resisting the strong enemy. The Daily Mail openly discussed the possibility of a British withdrawal from Greece, stating that since the southern Balkan nations could not form a common front, it has been clear that we could not long withstand the tremendous pressure from the German forces. Greece is our ally, and we have a responsibility to stand in solidarity for the sake of honor, but we must decide when the Greeks believe that the time has come to withdraw from Greece. This time seems almost inevitable. The Germans hold absolute air superiority in Greece, and the decisive factor in the air, which will determine the outcome, is now reappearing. An editorial in The Times similarly recalled that although the United States had guaranteed aid to Greece, Greece had already decided to resist a German invasion, regardless of whether there was British assistance. It is simply absurd to suggest that Britain could have taken a better course than sending troops to fight in Greece. When the Empire's forces began landing in Greece, they had not embraced the possibility of forming an alliance with Greece to resist aggression, which would have thwarted any hope of stopping the German onslaught. For various reasons, unity has not been achieved, allowing the Germans to carry out a strategy of divide and conquer. They will conquer those who can be threatened by threatening them and conquer those who cannot be threatened by force. We may hear more bad news soon. If this news comes with disappointment, it should not be blamed on our current actions but on unfortunate and ineffective facts in the past. However, all the newspapers have optimistic comments about the future, believing that once the other troops currently gathering arrive on the scene, they will eventually defeat Hitler. An editorial in the Daily News stated that the great war in the East will not end soon, and the Nazi forces will certainly choose to strike forcefully where the sea does not restrain them. However, the power to command a major war with the combined forces of the sea, land, and air lies with us, not with Hitler. (Reuters dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<p>Londoners Speculate on Germany's Next Step</p>
<p>London - As German forces have invaded the Thessalian plain in Greece, British figures here have been speculating on Hitler's next step: driving Britain out of the Mediterranean. Several military commentators predict that the British Empire forces will face the great challenge of defending the routes through the rugged mountains south of the plain to Athens. Experts predict that the British and Greek forces will retreat again to shorter lines, which were 150 miles long several days ago but are now only about 75 miles. Mr. Hurd, the famous military expert of the Daily Mail, predicted that the new British and Greek line will be in the mountainous area from the Gulf of Lamia to the Gulf of Atalanti. He said that if the right wing of the British and Greek forces is stationed just north of the Gulf of Lamia, there will be more protection. However, if the right wing is located on the gulf near the historically famous pass of Thermopylae, the line will be shorter. Diplomatic experts, in speculating on Hitler's next move, are closely watching the situation in Turkey. They already have some confidence in the situation in Iraq, as strong British forces have arrived in Basra. A Daily Mail reporter in Istanbul believes that the statement in the Berlin communiqué that German Ambassador von Papen will not return to Turkey for at least two weeks indicates that Hitler wants to make "impossible demands" on Turkey as soon as German forces complete their military operations in Greece. The newspaper said that Germany will certainly demand that Turkey abandon its alliance with Britain and give Hitler the convenience of acting in western Asia, so that Hitler can attack Britain's position in the Mediterranean from both the east and west. In discussing the results of the Spanish cabinet meeting, a diplomatic reporter for the Daily Chronicle predicted that Spain may either join the Tripartite Pact or take action in Morocco to expel the Sultan's suzerainty, or possibly do both simultaneously. However, a diplomatic reporter for The Times argued that news from northern and central Europe indicates that Germany is talking about attacking the Soviet Union. The reporter said that there is certainly a faction in Berlin that is clamoring for an immediate attack on the Soviet Union, and Hitler may be allowing them to talk freely in the hope that these statements will reach Moscow's ears, so that Moscow can quickly give Germany more economic concessions and avoid the day of doom.

<h3>Spanish Cabinet Meets for Several Days; Rumors of Major Decisions; Foreign Minister Suñer Reports on International Situation, Paying Particular Attention to Recent British Setbacks</h3>
<p>Madrid: After two days of meetings, the Spanish cabinet concluded yesterday evening, issuing an official report stating, "Foreign Minister Suñer delivered remarks on all aspects of important military and diplomatic events in the current international situation." The Spanish Fascist Party's Arriba newspaper published an article based on this, which was quite similar to the language it used when Spain was about to make a political decision. It stated, "Discussions that are contrary to the sole foreign policy that guides our destiny cannot be considered. Our views on foreign policy must be unified. Anyone who thinks otherwise is a cowardly traitor." (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>London: According to news from Madrid, it is generally believed that Spain will make a major decision regarding the war after two days of cabinet meetings. Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer reported to the Spanish cabinet members on the latest developments in the international military and diplomatic situation, paying particular attention to recent British setbacks. Some observers here believe that a powerful faction in the Spanish government, with the help of Axis pressure, is attempting to drag Spain into the war, hoping to get a share of the spoils after Britain's defeat. However, it is reported that other elements in Spain favor continuing to maintain neutrality because they believe that Britain will overcome the crisis in the next few days and gain the upper hand. It is said that General Franco's advisors said that the war situation might have unexpected changes, they also pointed out "the lessons of Italy", when Italy joined the war, it was believed that the result of the war, all democratic countries will be defeated. Everyone knows that the United States' foreign policy will strongly oppose Spain's joining the war. Spain is already in a state of famine. The Spanish ambassador to the United States is appealing to the United States for food relief to the Spanish people, and the United States has already provided some relief. If Spain joins the war, it will no longer be able to expect assistance from the United States. Domestically it will have to deal with famine and externally it will have to defend against British attacks. (International News Service dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Madrid: Neutral sources speculate that Spain is very likely to announce cooperation with the Axis powers, and there is a possibility of assisting the Axis powers in attacking Gibraltar, invading Portugal, or occupying the Azores as a submarine base. It is believed that Spain's assistance to the Axis powers will not be in actively participating in the war, but in complying with the Axis powers' wishes without hindrance.

<p>Miscellaneous Notes on the European War (4) (6)</p>
<h3>A Panoramic View of the American Navy</h3>
<p>The Naval War College students show the greatest interest in indoor simulated battles. Of course, a simulated war cannot be compared to a real one. However, the theory of combat is always the same. What is worrying is that, based on past experience, before a battle, everyone always feels that everything is strategically arranged very carefully and calculated very precisely. Who knew that one mistake would cause everything to go wrong, making it impossible to salvage. The reason for this, of course, must be attributed to human negligence and mistakes. All training goals in military schools are based on completeness and meticulousness, so that the American naval power can respond to any different environment. Its meticulousness is only comparable to that of German military experts. Whenever a strategy is determined, if the environment changes, then all tactics will immediately change accordingly.</p>
<p>The tactics of indoor simulated battles are of course perfect and flawless. Each toy warship model represents a part of the naval power of a certain country. The tonnage, firepower, and special points of all warships are clearly marked, so those participating in the battle can clearly understand the strength of themselves and the enemy. Each time a simulated battle is conducted, the combat strategies of both sides, as well as the formations and transfer steps, are strictly kept secret, and each is separated by a curtain to prevent the other side from seeing. The instructor acts as the referee and informs the students of the sea weather and wind direction in advance. The students then mobilize their troops and generals, doing what a commander-in-chief should do. They even avoid speaking casually, fearing that their combat plan will be inadvertently leaked out, harming the national interest.</p>
<p>Small black curtains represent smoke screens. Airplanes are suspended on poles, and their flight altitude is also noted. The course of the ships is marked with chalk on the painted cloth on the ground. The commanders of the submarine teams and air squadrons of both sides are in other rooms waiting for orders, ready to be mobilized. During the stipulated time, the commanders arrange their formations, the speed or direction of various warships, open various artillery fire, release smoke screens, send out reconnaissance planes, or bomb enemy supply ships. Everything is like a real battle, allowing no carelessness.</p>
<p>The referees sit behind the partition wall, carefully watching the actions of both sides and calculating the degree of damage suffered by both fleets. The calculation method is based on the strength of a certain ship as recorded in the "Regulations" book. For example, if a warship has encountered a certain amount of artillery fire or bombing damage, then its combat effectiveness will be lost to a certain extent. Such battles take a week, and then the referees make a final criticism and decide whether the attacking fleet has completed a certain task or even encountered failure.</p>
<p>Famous naval battles in history are often re-enacted indoors. The Battle of Jutland in 1916, in which the British navy made mistakes that affected the overall situation, is often brought up in the Naval War College as material for exercises. When the British and German navies fought at sea, it lasted only twelve hours, but in the classroom, this battle took three weeks to fight. Sometimes, in order to test the students' resourcefulness, the instructors often raise some "quick-decision problems," asking them to give answers in three to five minutes.</p>
<p>The Naval War College authorities often invite army or Marine Corps officers, as well as ambitious diplomatic personnel, to listen to their lectures in order to "copy" Hitler's so-called military diplomacy, integrating action and speech. Within the Naval War College, students do not wear uniforms, and it is often the case that the students' rank is higher than that of the instructors. There are a total of 22 instructors and 40 experts teaching at the school. Therefore, the number of teachers is now more than the number of students. The school's library contains 75,000 specialized books related to the navy. There are no exams or grading in the school, but students with high ability always take the lead. In addition to normal coursework, there is also a correspondence department, which is designed for students who cannot come to the school in person to study. On the whole, this Naval War College cannot be called the best military school, but comparatively speaking, it is always among the best in the world.</p>
<p>(5) Training of Sailors and Officers</p>
<p>Having warships without personnel means that millions of tons of steel cannot exert their power. Talking about navigation is so difficult that one must devote one's life to it to have any hope of success. What's more, warships bear the heavy task of killing the enemy and achieving results. In the turbulent seas, there can be no errors in the combat staff room, and the artillery turrets must be fully coordinated. It takes six years of enlistment training to create a sailor. The time to build a warship is only the same.</p>
<p>The United States has no shortage of sailors in terms of manpower supply. In the next four years, even if the two-ocean navy needs 300,000 sailors, there will be no difficult problem. Because the number of American naval recruits is always maintained to a considerable extent, and there is never a shortage. Those who become sailors should ideally have a third-year junior high school education, and their intelligence and physical strength are most qualified at this time.</p>
<p>American youths who are 18 years of age have the qualifications to join the navy as sailors. After joining, they will first undergo six weeks of basic training at the "Great Lakes Naval Training Station" in Lake Michigan. Then they are sent to warships, living in "narrow alley" style cabins with twenty people, to earnestly learn all the skills of being a sailor. Obeying discipline and enduring hardship, everything is very strict. Unless he transfers to the "Annapolis" Naval Academy, he will only be a private for the rest of his life and will never be able to wear the gold thread badge, let alone become a naval admiral. But there are many kinds of courses that sailors can learn. There are as many as 59 learning places on shore, and by learning step by step, they can also gain a small "future". (To be continued)</p>
<h3>British Forces in Abyssinia Pursue Defeated Italian Army, Advance to Suburbs of Italian Stronghold of Dessie; German Attack on Tobruk Repelled</h3>
<p>London: Reuters learned today that King Selassie of Abyssinia is expediting arrangements to return to the Abyssinian capital, Addis Ababa.

Well-informed sources in Cairo also said that there were no signs of change in the situation of the Axis forces in Libya. It has been revealed that among the British forces defending Tobruk are Indian troops and mechanized units. It has been a long time since the Indian army participated in the Western Desert War.

<h3>Pope Urges Belligerent Countries to Pay Attention to Humanity</h3>
<p>Vatican: One thousand university students, doctors, lawyers, and others from Italian Catholic organizations met with the Pope.

When a nation is waging war for its glory or self-defense, humanity and charity will not weaken the people's bravery and patriotism, nor will they hinder their combat effectiveness, but according to the meaning of charity, it must not attack or kill innocent people, and must not kill indiscriminately even to the enemy other than those who need to be. The world does not need vanity and violence, but charity and love. (United Press dispatch, 21st)</p>

<h3>Pétain Speaks to French Farmers in Pau; Asks for Full Cooperation with the Government; Help Solve the Food Problem</h3>
<p>Vichy: Marshal Pétain inspected Pau in the Pyrenees and returned here by train at 9:30 AM today. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Pau, Southern France: Marshal Pétain arrived here at 9:30 AM this morning, accompanied by Vice-President of the Council and Ministers of Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Navy, Admiral Darlan, Minister of Agriculture Caziot, Director of Information Marion, and other dignitaries. At that time, a large number of farmers gathered at the station to cheer and pay their respects. After getting off the train, Marshal Pétain went to the war memorial to lay a wreath and then gave a broadcast speech here, calling on farmers across the country to work together and participate in the restoration work, briefly stating that the best way for farmers to assist the government is to engage in their own work to facilitate the government in solving the most pressing and difficult food problem. The government has already taken various steps for farmers across the country to improve their lives, the most important of which are the following: (1) To form a combination of farmers across the country, (2) To raise the status of farmers in society, (3) Modernization of agricultural equipment, (4) Government promulgation of rural laws, (5) Re-distribution of land property, in short, the government should adopt a practical policy on land, changing the abuses that have occurred in the past. The largest reform of all is the amendment of the primary school curriculum to include agricultural education. However, the government's concern for farmers is not enough to save the country, so it is hoped that all farmers across the country can abide by discipline, supply all the products owned by the land for national consumption, and adapt to the current environment, devote themselves to work, and increase production, and must cherish any items and never waste them. If they are useful, they must be fully utilized. At present, the domestic food problem is quite serious. The systems and methods adopted by the government for this problem must be understood, and must be followed and implemented. Farmers in our country have always been known to the world for their hard work and endurance, we must respect them, which is essential for the survival of the motherland, and it is no different from soldiers defending the motherland. All my farmers, do not be discouraged, and if you encounter difficulties and be discouraged, reducing work, only enough to maintain the needs of a family, then the result will be that the food problem will become more difficult. In short, I trust the farmers, and I believe that you will be able to help me complete the great cause of saving the country and restoring the nation. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>

Unexpectedly, within the 45 minutes before the evening close, it suddenly surged dramatically, leaping over the 6,700 yuan mark. Sentiment from all quarters was strangely firm, entirely driven by rumors. It was said that the war in eastern Zhejiang was expanding, Fuzhou was in a state of emergency, and it was also rumored that the Hong Kong Exchange Fund would abandon maintaining the city's foreign exchange. The foreign exchange rate was reported to be tightening sharply, exacerbating the situation. Cheng Kee and Yi Yuan sold a small amount in the morning at 6,610 yuan, but later came back to buy.

<p>Since the morning, each bar (10 taels) opened at 6,620 yuan at 9:15 AM, which was 20 yuan higher than the midday closing price on the previous Saturday. Xin Feng Yong vigorously bought, pushing it up to 6,640 yuan, but the foreign exchange rate was very stable, and Cheng Kee and Yi Da came to sell, causing it to fall back by over 20 yuan, to around 6,620 yuan, where it briefly fluctuated. Yi Yuan, Yi Feng, and Xin Yuan came to sell, and around 10 o'clock, it fell to 6,610 yuan. Exchange brokers then came to buy, and Xin Feng Yong and Da Feng absorbed it to between 6,633 and 35 yuan, fluctuating for a long time. Yi Da absorbed it, pushing it up again to 6,640 yuan. Retail investors sold, bringing it down to 6,628 yuan. The midday closing price was 6,632 yuan. The afternoon opened at 2 o'clock at 6,635 yuan, quickly reaching 6,638 yuan. De Da, Da Feng, and Xin Feng Yong came to sell, retreating to 6,629 yuan. Afterward, it hovered around 6,635 yuan, with only a few yuan of fluctuation. After 3 o'clock, the foreign exchange rate was reported to be tight, and various positive rumors also arose, stimulating buying. Securities firm Yi Da vigorously bought, and Da Feng, Cheng Kee, Yi Yuan, Heng Kee, De Fu, He Sheng, De Da, and others tended to compete for purchases. Sellers watched, and the price soared over 100 yuan, breaking out of the 6,700 yuan mark, rising to 6,740 yuan. De Da came out again to sell, and retail investors also sold, retreating to 6,705 yuan, but the sentiment was upward, and buying soon started again. The 4 o'clock closing price was 6,730 yuan, which was 130 yuan higher than the midday closing price on the previous Saturday. Based on the selling price of May American currency at 5.1875 yuan, it was 6,713.25 yuan, an actual premium of 16.75 yuan. After the market closed, Yi Yuan sold up to 6,718 yuan, and the final price was 6,725 yuan. The entire day had a fluctuation of 130 yuan. The selling price of cash gold by gold shops was 170 yuan higher than the black market futures price, and the buying price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for spot gold.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Listed at 710 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at silver shops, Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang, rose by 10 yuan at 4 o'clock in the evening, reaching 710 yuan. The buying price was reduced by 40 yuan. At the evening market of 1,000 yuan, no one was willing to sell. One original package of "small twist" rice has reached 156 yuan, with Saigon rice trading at premiums of 600-700 yuan to 800-900 yuan per hundred bags. Because transactions are few and small twist rice is more active, its price is higher. Therefore, the selling price of Ying Hua Company's No. 1 Saigon rice was 150 yuan in the early market, rising to 153 yuan, and 155 yuan in the afternoon. No. 2 rice traded at premiums of 500-600 yuan, broken rice also had a premium of 500 yuan, and "rough" rice had a premium of 300 yuan. Based on these premium prices, some were calculated according to Ying Hua Company's rates, while others were paying a premium on top of the initial listed price. The reason for the high market price is still the rumors of the current situation that stimulate sentiment. In reality, 200,000 bags of stored rice were added last week, with 30,000-50,000 bags arriving every day. Orders last week included 150,000 bags of broken rice and 150,000 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice. The number of direct orders was even greater, and new orders were still going smoothly. However, some unscrupulous merchants ignore the facts, only seeking to profit, absorbing and shouting high prices. Yesterday's actual sales were less than 20,000 bags, while the trading volume of Ying Hua Company rice by hoarders was extremely large. There were also Ningbo merchants hoping for the fall of their hometown, buying and storing large quantities in order to obtain huge profits. However, they can still gain a reputation for providing relief.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Continues to Arrive in Shanghai: The Taikoo Company's Hunan ship, loaded with 12,649 bags of foreign rice and 2,458 bags of corn from Hong Kong, arrived at noon yesterday, temporarily docking at the company's wharf in Pudong. It is scheduled to sail to the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession this morning for unloading. (Zu)</p>
<p>Arrivals of thick, thin japonica, and other types of national rice remain scarce and sales have been sluggish. Hearing that black market prices for foreign rice continue to rise, sentiment is good, and trade is quite active. Sellers have abnormally raised prices, and all selling prices have broken out of the limited price range. Privately quoted prices: common japonica 133 yuan, Kunshan japonica 128-129 yuan, Qingjiao thin rice 122 yuan. Glutinous rice is very popular and follows the surge, with Hong Kong white rice selling for 118-119 yuan, and glutinous sprouts 114-115 yuan. All prices are 3-4 yuan higher than the week before.</p>
<h3>Flour Market in the Midst of Brewing</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's flour market was calm as usual, because the trading of the Grains Public Association has not yet returned to normal. The authorities are monitoring very closely, and speculators have disappeared. Foreign flour is also restricted by the Grains Public Association, so formal trading is still suspended. It is said that those who directly distribute to customers outside the Association have slightly different selling prices, because large merchants holding onto goods refuse to release them unless prices rise, while some retail investors, limited by capital, secretly seek to sell. The current market prices: Australian flour (Flower Bird Clock Tower brand) 30.05-30.30 yuan, Kan flour (Golden Dragon brand) 29.875-29.875 yuan. The market is still in the midst of brewing.</p>
<p>Wheat: Trading is even more desolate, because the source of inland durum wheat can be said to be almost nonexistent. The market trading has long been virtually suspended. It is said that Japanese factories' retail sales are extremely small, with the price still at 45-46 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oilcake: Soybean Cake Reaches New High Price</h3>
<p>Since the price of oilcake in the grains market has been limited, the market turned active yesterday, because there are various types of goods and different qualities, and the market is not organized on a daily basis. Therefore, there are difficulties enforcing the limited price, so the general situation has loosened, and the market has become lively. Soybean cake trading is particularly fierce, and the price has risen in a semi-public situation, reaching a new high for the month. Over 4,000 pieces of Cheng Kee soybean cake were traded, with the price rising from 17.40 yuan to 18 yuan. Futures trading of 6,000 pieces: late April delivery 18.10-18.20 yuan, early May delivery 18.25-18.55 yuan. Yuan Long cake and Fei Zi cake for early May delivery were priced at 18.40 yuan, with 25 cartloads traded. 1,000 pieces of Chang Kee cake were priced at 18.05 yuan, and delivery was for late April. The current price of Huo Yuan Kee cake was 17.30 yuan, and early May delivery was 18.10 yuan, with 3,000 pieces traded. 2,000 pieces of Li Zi cake were traded at a price of 17.50-17.55 yuan. Actual sales accounted for one-third, with the remainder being traders, speculators, and "kicking the ball" customers. Today, 250 bags of soybeans were shipped to Xiamen, 845 bags to Hong Kong, along with 140 bags of sesame and 1,000 cans of sesame oil.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Yarn Falls and Then Jumps; Evening Price Reaches the 500 Yuan Mark Again</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to be weak due to the fierce fighting in eastern Zhejiang, causing the market to be slightly uncertain. At the same time, short sellers were active, and the market was depressed. However, the price of 20s Double Horse yarn was still strong. At the end of last week, Annam purchased 1,600 bales at a price of 1,430 yuan. Today, Hong Kong merchants bought 1,000 bales at a price of 1,410 yuan. These spot goods were immediately shipped out of the country, so there were many who were optimistic. The high price for 20s Double Horse was 1,500 yuan, and the low price was 1,477 yuan. The initial trade in the afternoon was at 1,488 yuan, rising to 1,491 yuan. Some short sellers then came to sell, returning to 1,487.5 yuan. After 3 o'clock, hearing that gold had soared, the yarn market followed, rising to 1,515 yuan. The final price was 1,514 yuan, and trading was quite active. Today, 395 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, 250 pieces to Luoluo, and 30 pieces to Yantai.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning, and the market was amicable, but most were bearish due to the unfavorable situation in Ningbo and Shaoxing. The opening price was 1,499 yuan. Subsequently, influenced by more sellers and fewer buyers, the market weakened, and the market price gradually declined to 1,477 yuan. However, spot sales of Double Horse were still strong, and those covering short positions came one after another. New bulls were slightly active, and at the same time, spot gold stabilized, gradually rising to 1,492 yuan. The price was slightly flat, at 1,487 yuan. A statistical analysis of transactions in the first half of the day was 9,955 bales. The amounts purchased by various groups are listed separately below. Hong Kong: 1,155 bales; Annam: 1,600 bales; Peer Groups: 6,200 bales; Total: 9,955 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Slightly Quiet</h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation is slightly flat, and the volume is not as active as in previous days. This is because the yarn market has rebounded and the foreign exchange market has stabilized, so sentiment has stabilized. Factories have not had much trading, and trading companies have only slightly adjusted some of the rental lint, while the rest is in a quiet state. However, the general sentiment is still optimistic about the future. Yesterday, 805 pieces of cotton came from Hong Kong, and a total of 2,600 pieces and 200 bales were traded, with prices rising by 1-2 yuan. A further breakdown is listed below.</p>
<p>Egyptian Cotton: 490 pieces (Shen Xin - all pieces)</p>
<p>Middling: 42 pieces (Hong Zhang - 100 pieces)</p>
<p>Indian NT: 375 pieces (Tong Yi - 300 pieces)</p>
<p>Rangoon Flower: 35 pieces (Xie Xin - 200 pieces)</p>
<p>Rangoon Flower: 36 pieces (Tai Xing - 200 pieces)</p>
<p>Rangoon Flower: 36 pieces (Xie Tong Xing - 200 pieces)</p>
<p>Rangoon Flower: 36.5 pieces (Xie Tong Xing - 200 pieces)</p>
<p>Rangoon Flower: 37 pieces (Xie Tong Xing - 400 pieces)</p>
<p>Another report says that foreign cotton trading by foreign firms seemed to be slightly suppressed due to the deteriorating situation in eastern Zhejiang and rumors of Ningbo being lost, but the base of the cotton market is still very firm, and the situation is calm and people are not afraid. Yesterday, there were still many trades between industry peers and factories, and Shen Xin even purchased 1,000 bales of long-staple Egyptian cotton, with the selling price approaching around 490 yuan.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market initially fell due to liquidations from all parties and political news from Washington that US President Roosevelt opposed increasing aid loans to farmers, but subsequently rose slightly due to short covering. As a result, closing prices fell 4-5 points compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially fell due to large liquidations from all parties, but subsequently rose slightly due to buying support. Closing prices fell by about 2 points each.</p>
<p>It is also predicted that the market will open higher by 1.5 rupees today.</p>
<p>Bombay Telegraph: Statistics of Indian cotton from September 1, last year to April 19 this year are recorded below (per bale of 400 pounds):</p>
<h3>Securities: Bond Market Difficult to Rise</h3>
<p>Due to the extremely serious situation in eastern Zhejiang, the bond market saw a surge in selling yesterday, and with the Four Banks still closed, short sellers took the opportunity to be very active, falling almost a yuan in the afternoon, and closing at a low price. The trend has not yet stabilized. Rumors persist that US economic and military aid have not yet been implemented, and it is feared that there will be no improvement in the short term. In the early morning opening, Heng Kang sold, and Tai and Sheng Xing bought along the way, with Class C rising from 5.25 yuan to 5.40 yuan. Afterwards, Xie Xing, Yuan Da, and Hua also sold, and the market returned to 5.15 yuan. The midday closing was slightly lower, at 5.3-5.4 yuan. In the afternoon, there were still many rumors. Sheng Dian also turned to sell, and Lian He, Xin Fu, Xin Hua, and Xie Xing all sold one after another. Although Yi Lian Yi, Xin Chang, and Yi Chang bought one after another, the number was not significant. The situation was still oversupply, and Class C opened at 5.10 yuan, immediately breaking below 5 yuan. Therefore, Class E also broke below 3 yuan, Class A broke below 4 yuan, and Class B also broke below 7 yuan. However, Class D has not yet opened. The result of supply and demand was a sharp drop across the board, ranging from 1.05 yuan to 1.25 yuan. There may be a rebound today. The total transaction volume was approximately 250,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>The stock market traded 150 shares of Da Sheng No. 3 Factory at a price of 31 yuan each.</p>
<p>Public utilities: The stock market opened slightly weaker and then rebounded. The total transaction volume was not large. Rubber stocks were more active than before.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Refined White Sugar Breaks the 100 Yuan Mark; Main Reason Is That Hoarders Are Releasing Goods</h3>
<p>Although the stock of sugar in Shanghai is not thin, most of it is in the hands of hoarders, who stubbornly refuse to sell, leading to a scarcity of goods in the industry. Therefore, the recent sharp rise is the result of the above factors. The market rose even more fiercely yesterday, because the market was full of rumors favorable to the bulls. The Public Association's current price of Grade 24 coarse white sugar was 94.3-95.7 yuan. The initial price of the futures for the end of April was flat at 94.4, 94.2, and 93.8 yuan, then rose sharply to 94.1, 94.6, 94.7 yuan, and even to 95.3, 95.5, and 96.0, 96.5, 97.5, reaching 98 yuan. New trading for May 10th also started, initially at 95.2, 95.4, 95.5, 95.0, 94.8, 95.4, 95.5, 96.0, 96.5, 96.8, 96.9, 97.0, 97.5, 98.0, 98.5, 98.9 yuan, closing at nearly 100 yuan at a price of 99.5 yuan. Taikoo car white B mark was 102.5, 103.5, 104, 104.5 yuan; DY mark 94, 94.5, 96 yuan; HX mark (West Wharf) 93.5 to 95 yuan, (East Wharf) 93.5 yuan, all rising in the range of 4-5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Not Affected by Actual Sales; Aftermarket Turns Higher</h3>
<p>Factory cloth: Yesterday's market fell and then rebounded. The morning opening was due to the fierce fighting in eastern Zhejiang, and actual sales were affected. Customers and industry peers urgently sought to sell, and selling prices fell step by step. Small amounts of Fortune Fine Cloth sold at a minimum of 46 yuan, and Fortune Twill sold at 40.05 yuan, each falling by about one yuan compared to the previous day. Later, there was a sudden positive news, and the black market Double Horse rebounded sharply, so the cloth price rebounded, returning to the original level of the previous day. However, transactions were scarce. Coarse cloth and coarse twill remained firm, and the current price of coarse twill was still sought after. The street traded over 300 pieces of various cloth, and Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants traded over 200 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Over 2,000 bolts of bleached and dyed cloth from Yih Ho and other factories were traded for Siam and other countries.</p>
<p>East cloth: The morning market saw a particularly sharp fall, with the minimum price of 12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth falling to 50.8-50.9 yuan. In the afternoon, due to Tianjin merchants and group customers searching to buy, the rebound was also healthy, rising to 51.65 yuan, a fall of 0.15 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. Four Gentlemen serge was around 1.555 yuan, with no significant change.</p>
<h3>Coal: Hoarders Release Goods at High Prices; Cooked Coal Prices Soften Slightly</h3>
<p>Due to the lack of goods, the black market price of cooked coal rose to 400 yuan last week. However, recently, hoarders have released old inventory at high prices, and there have been transactions, so prices have softened. Yesterday, peer trading was at 380 yuan, and there were also transactions at 380 yuan, a drop of 20 yuan. Street shops were selling screened lumps at 440 yuan per ton, and general coal at 418 yuan, delivered to the Rong family, including commissions.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Ribbed Steel Bars Still Sought After</h3>
<p>Ribbed Steel Bars: The price of ribbed steel bars has been rising continuously in recent days. It is reported that this is due to purchases by a certain organization, and also because the source of these goods has long been cut off. Those on the market are only the inventory in Shanghai, so those holding the goods have a firm mind and the price soars. Yesterday, the market price for 3/8 and 1/2 inch sizes was 3,600 yuan per ton, and the price for 5/8 inch to 1 inch sizes was 3,500 yuan per ton, a rise of 100 yuan compared to before.</p>
<h3>Grain: Rice Market's Black Market Price Rises; "Small Twist" Rice Premium Is 1,000 Yuan; Original Packages Already Reach 156 Yuan; The Chaotic Market Is Even More Unimaginable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market was smoky and chaotic, and the black market premium has been secretly publicized. Not only has the limited price long been broken, but it seems that premiums are rising higher and higher. The initial premium for "small twist" rice was 600-700 yuan, then 800-900 yuan, and finally 1,000 yuan per 100 bags.</p>

<h3>Continue to Vigorously Implement Electricity Restrictions: Overuse Charged at Six Times the Rate; Electricity Allocation Report Awaits Study; Hope All Types of Users Make Every Effort to Conserve</h3>
<p>According to a statement by the Public Works Department, this bureau previously established a special committee to study the allocation of electricity, responsible for reviewing and recommending allocation methods. The committee has now completed its report, which will be considered by the new board of directors. Any severe measures restricting electricity supply will undoubtedly have a significant impact, especially on the industrial sector. Currently, industrial electricity consumption accounts for 72% of the Shanghai Power Company's power production. Therefore, the aforementioned report should be carefully considered to ensure prudence.</p>
<p>Coal Stockpile Dwindling Daily</p>
<p>According to a report from the Shanghai Power Company, the current electricity restriction measures, which allocate 70% of the standard electricity consumption to users consuming over 1,000 kilowatt-hours per month, and charge three times the rate for consumption exceeding this allocation, have not been effective in conserving electricity. Meanwhile, coal consumption far exceeds replenishment. On February 24th of this year, the company's coal stockpile was 150,700 tons, but by April 1st, it had decreased to approximately 120,000 tons.</p>
<p>Excess Allocation: Six Times the Rate</p>
<p>In light of the company's dwindling fuel reserves and the time required to consider the special committee's report, this bureau has approved the continued implementation of the aforementioned electricity restriction measures. However, the charge for consumption exceeding the approved allocation will be increased from three times to six times the average electricity price.</p>
<p>Increased Revenue Allocated to Reserve</p>
<p>It is solemnly declared that the company is not profiting from this. The increased revenue will be allocated to the fuel reserve fund for uses most beneficial to users, such as purchasing exceptionally expensive coal. If such coal can be obtained, it can allow industry to continue without burdening users who do not exceed their approved allocation with the full cost of this high-priced coal.</p>
<p>Still Hope All Sectors Find Ways to Conserve</p>
<p>Furthermore, attention should be paid to the serious fuel supply situation. It is earnestly hoped that all types of users will make every effort to conserve electricity. Otherwise, strict and compulsory restriction measures will be unavoidable.</p>
<p>Strict Restrictions to Achieve Results</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Shanghai Power Company believes that due to fuel scarcity, it is difficult to maintain the supply needed by all city users. Therefore, with the approval of the Public Works Department at the beginning of last month, it announced electricity conservation measures. However, since implementation, not only has the conservation been minimal and failed to meet expectations, but also efforts to dredge and clear ships to ensure fuel supply have been ineffective. The company's coal reserves, which originally stood at 150,000 tons last month, intended for emergency use, are now being depleted by 25,000 tons per month to cover consumption deficits, reducing the current reserves to 120,000 tons. This has made the company's fuel situation even more severe than when electricity reduction was previously implemented. The company's special committee for studying electricity conservation has researched further electricity restriction measures and submitted a proposal to the Public Works Department for review. Acknowledging the severity of the situation and seeking to implement measures as soon as possible, the department passed part of the proposal at last week's board meeting, deciding to implement it starting on the 24th of this month. At that time, users consuming more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours will be charged six times the electricity price to achieve strict restriction results.</p>
<p>Electricity Restriction: Newly Revised Measures</p>
<p>Yesterday at 10:30 AM, Mr. Hawkins, President of the Shanghai Power Company, held a reception for reporters at the company's headquarters on the sixth floor of Nanjing Road to announce the new electricity conservation measures. The text is as follows: "Previously, the Shanghai Public Works Department approved a tripling of charges for excess electricity consumption to restrict electricity use, aiming to conserve fuel during this emergency period. However, it has been found that this measure has failed to achieve its objective, and fuel consumption far exceeds its replenishment. Due to the urgent situation, and during the discussion of the Special Committee's recommendations, the Shanghai Public Works Department has approved the following measures, effective immediately, and repealing all previous announcements: (1) For all users with a monthly standard electricity consumption of 1,000 kilowatt-hours or more from January 1940 to January 1941, starting from the company's next meter reading date, they may only use 70% of their standard electricity consumption, charged at the prevailing electricity price. If this 70% electricity consumption is less than 1,000 kilowatt-hours, then 1,000 kilowatt-hours will be the minimum limit. (2) Electricity consumption exceeding the quota limit will be charged at six times the average electricity price. In other words, the electricity bill for electricity consumption exceeding the limit should be six times the average electricity price obtained by dividing the total electricity bill (calculated at the current price) by the total kilowatt-hours consumed. (3) For users with a monthly standard electricity consumption of 1,000 kilowatt-hours or less, if they exceed 1,000 kilowatt-hours in any month, the exceeding portion will be charged at six times the average electricity price charged for the first 1,000 kilowatt-hours. (4) The purpose of the increased electricity charges in the above (2) and (3) items is to restrict electricity use and conserve fuel. The company does not profit from this. All revenue, except that charged at the prevailing electricity price, will be allocated to the 'Fuel Conservation Reserve' to be used for purposes beneficial to users, as agreed upon by the Public Works Department and the company in the future. (5) Until further notice, the company will not accept any applications for large or ordinary (small) electricity supply, whether new installations or additions. (6) During this fuel emergency period, it is earnestly hoped that all users, large and small, will conserve electricity as much as possible."</p>
<h3>Sluggish Sales: Yarn Mills Reduce Production</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn industry in this city once flourished after the war. However, since the incident on May 2nd of last year, market prices have been falling, causing severe damage to speculators. Although market prices have gradually shown improvement recently, actual sales are sluggish, leading to a surplus. Furthermore, the Shanghai Power Company believes that the overseas situation is very unfavorable, fearing problems with fuel sources. Therefore, yarn mills are planning to reduce production by 20%. Production will decrease, while actual sales remain sluggish.</p>
<h3>A Corner of Crowded Traffic on Nanjing Road</h3>
<p>On the roads in the International Settlement, pedestrians are crowded and vehicle traffic is frequent, which municipal authorities often consider a difficult problem to solve. We only need to look at the busiest Nanjing Road, where the north side of the Daxin Company is a bus stop, and the south end is also a bus stop. Sometimes (as shown in the picture), a row of trams, cars, or buses come one after another, like a train with a dozen cars. Pedestrians who want to cross the road often wait impatiently.

<h3>Eastern Zhejiang: Chinese Troops Gather; Japanese Army Heavily Defeated in Shaoxing; Ningbo Bombed with Few Casualties; No Response to Telegram Inquiry</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's news from Eastern Zhejiang, the Japanese troops who invaded Shaoxing have suffered heavy attacks from the Chinese side and are showing signs of retreat. Unofficial sources claim that the Chinese army has recaptured Shaoxing, but confirmation is pending. The situation in Ningbo is also very chaotic at present. It is said that the Japanese aircraft bombings in Ningbo caused substantial material damage, but most people had evacuated to the countryside, resulting in few deaths. According to the person in charge of the Ningbo Association, the association sent telegrams to Ningbo on the morning of the 19th (i.e., the 19th), but has not received a response to date. This suggests that the situation there is even more serious.</p>
<p>Chaos in Ningbo; Street Battles in Wenzhou</p>
<p>According to inquiries made last night by the Dakong News Agency's reporter to the Shanghai Zhejiang community about the Zhejiang situation: (1) Since the Japanese army forcibly landed at Wanghai Mountain, Jinji Mountain, and other places east of Zhenhai on the morning of the 19th, the local garrison immediately counterattacked. The Japanese army reinforced its troops under the cover of artillery fire and broke into Ningbo. (2) The Japanese troops who landed at Haimen suffered setbacks in their attack by the Chinese army and have sent warships to reinforce 2,000 soldiers to continue their assault on Huangyan. (3) The Japanese troops who landed in Ruian and Banpu launched fierce street battles in Wenzhou on the afternoon of the 19th. (4) Haimen, Linhai, Zhuji, and other places have also fallen.</p>
<p>People in Wenzhou and Ningbo Relatively Calm</p>
<p>According to inquiries made separately by the Datong News Agency's reporter to the Shanghai Zhejiang community: (1) Since the Japanese warships forcibly landed troops at Shipai in the south of Xiangshan County, Haimen above Huangyan, Ruian north of Wenzhou, and Zhenhai on the coast of Eastern Zhejiang, the local garrisons have separately launched counterattacks and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. (2) The Japanese troops who attacked from the south of Sanjiang City entered Shaoxing on the 17th and continued to attack Liugongbu in the southwest that evening. Fighting is still ongoing. (3) The Shanghai community telegraphed Ningbo and Wenzhou yesterday to inquire about details, but have not yet received a reply. According to private telegrams, the local situation has become chaotic. Organizations and groups are working in the countryside, and residents are evacuating to the suburbs. However, because Zhenhai once fell last year, the residents have been through alarms and disturbances and the people are relatively calm.</p>
<p>Telecommunications Interrupted; Parcel Post Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>The American news agencies and Great Northern, Pacific and other telegraphic agencies in this port have suspended telegrams to Ningbo, Zhenhai, Haimen, Yongjia (Wenzhou) and other places from yesterday. However, Jin Hua and other places are still open. The Shanghai Postal Administration has decided to temporarily suspend the collection of bulk and small parcel post to Zhejiang, Fujian and Jiangxi provinces and cities from today. The Parcel Post Sealing and Dispatching Group of the Bureau has issued an announcement that says, "Due to transportation difficulties, all bulk and small parcel post items destined for Fujian and Jiangxi, and those transiting through these locations, will be temporarily suspended for collection from the 22nd of this month. In addition, the collection of bulk and small parcel post to various places in Eastern Zhejiang will also be temporarily suspended from that day. Ordinary registered express mail and postcards from Shanghai to the above-mentioned places are still being collected and the postal orders are still being issued as usual and there should be no disruption later."</p>
<p>Important Highways Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>According to those familiar with the situation in Eastern Zhejiang who told Dakong News Agency reporters, after the Japanese announced the blockade of the coast, Eastern Zhejiang lost its economic value long ago, and according to the current war situation, it has no military value. Moreover, in addition to the coastal area of Zhejiang Province, the Siming, Kuocang, Tiantai and other mountains meander, the terrain is high and dangerous, and the Chinese army has already completely destroyed all the important highways, so it is difficult for the Japanese army to peer deeper to achieve its goal.</p>
<h3>Labor Day: City's Workers Intensify Production; Employers Should Also Voluntarily Raise Wages</h3>
<p>International Labor Day on May 1st is approaching rapidly. The Shanghai labor community will take a day off on that day to celebrate, but because it is an extraordinary time, no gatherings will be held, and the celebration will avoid extravagance. In order to promote the significance of Labor Day, all the workers in the city have decided to work hard at their posts and, in the spirit of labor-management cooperation, step up production. At the same time, employers in various industries, in this autumn of abnormal prices and difficult lives for workers, should also voluntarily improve the treatment of workers as much as possible within their means to alleviate the suffering of workers' lives. On that day, the authorities of the two settlements also decided to implement strict precautions to prevent unscrupulous elements from engaging in misconduct and to maintain public safety.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department's Provisional Board of Directors: Difficult to Achieve Immediately; Awaiting Decision from the National Government in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Although the Public Works Department's provisional board of directors was approved by the special meeting of Nazis some days ago, it is still awaiting the decision of the National Government in Chongqing yesterday. What is Chongqing's attitude? It is impossible to know for the moment. According to well-informed sources, all parties concerned have agreed to the so-called provisional board of directors of international goodwill and cooperation. At present, the final decision is up to Chongqing's attitude. It is said that the relevant parties are now conducting negotiations with Chongqing, and it is expected that the National Government will issue an announcement soon.</p>
<p>Still Not Approved by Various Countries</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" says that although the provisional board of directors of the Public Works Department has been approved by a vote at the previous special meeting of foreign taxpayers in the Public Concession, the council is still in its infancy today (the 21st) because it is awaiting approval from the countries concerned and the Chinese government. It is not possible to inquire from the officialdom when the provisional board of directors can start working, and it is also not known for sure whether this change of the Public Works Department will await the approval of the Chongqing central government. It is said that the countries concerned are expected to instruct their consuls in Shanghai to convey their replies within a few days. As for the nature of the reply, it cannot be predicted. The date is May 11.</p>
<h3>The YMCA Advocates the "Parents' Day": Date is May 11</h3>
<p>In recent years, Chinese society has gradually paid more attention to women, children, parents, etc., such as holding Women's Day and Children's Day, which are significant expressions. Now, the Chinese YMCA, in view of the importance of parents' status, has launched the Chinese Parents' Day to be held every second Sunday in May (this year is May 11), with the aim of promoting filial piety, increasing parents' welfare, and promoting parents' education. Moreover, Christian schools and church organizations in various parts of China, in imitation of the American custom, have held Mother's Day on the second Sunday of May every year. However, the YMCA believes that this approach emphasizes motherhood and neglects fatherhood, which is contrary to the country's culture and traditional habits. It has issued circulars to relevant parties that the Parents' Day should be held from 1941 to replace the former Mother's Day. The association recently elected Chen Zhengfan, Guan Cuizhen, and others who originally proposed Parents' Day to be responsible for drafting the "Purpose and Methods of Holding Parents' Day." The following is an excerpt of the methods of holding it on a personal level: (1) Wear flowers to express love and remembrance to parents. Wear red flowers if parents are alive; wear white flowers if parents have passed away; wear blue flowers if the father or mother has passed away. (2) Present gifts to parents. (3) Hold a banquet for parents to celebrate their health. (4) Invite parents to participate in entertainment occasions to increase their happiness. (5) Present flowers to ailing parents to express greetings. (6) Send letters to parents in faraway places to ask about their well-being. (7) If parents have passed away, offer fresh flowers on their graves to express deep mourning. (8) If parents have passed away, and siblings have already separated, they should live together for one day to recall the past and express their remembrance of their parents. (9) Provide relief to impoverished and helpless parents. (10) Assist parents who are in difficulty.</p>

<h3>Li Dingmo Shot Dead in the Zhongnan Hotel Yesterday: Shot Dead While Walking Up the Escalator; Assailant Arrested While Trying to Escape, Shot in the Buttocks</h3>
<p>In the Zhongnan Hotel on Aiduya Road near Dongxin Bridge, a shooting occurred suddenly at about 4:45 PM yesterday. The victim, Li Dingmo, worked in the banking industry. The assailant was alone and was apprehended while trying to escape at the intersection of Guangdong Road and Fujian Road. The following is an investigation of the situation:</p>
<p>Bullet Pierced Chest and Back, Instant Death</p>
<p>At about 4:15 PM yesterday, a customer wearing a silk gown and yellow leather shoes entered the Zhongnan Hotel at 560 Aiduya Road and went upstairs via the stairs. When he reached the turning point on the first floor, several people followed him from behind without asking why. He was suddenly shot at with a box cannon. At that time, the man was unable to dodge in a hurry and was hit in the back, piercing through his chest, and fell to the ground in response. Because the injury was to a key area, he died instantly.</p>
<p>Rushing to Escape; Indian Police Pursued Closely</p>
<p>At the time of the incident, the hotel was full of customers, who were busy going back and forth. When the gunshot suddenly sounded, the passengers ran for shelter. When the assassin saw that the goal had been achieved, he mingled with the crowd and ran out the door to escape. An Indian policeman was patrolling and saw the assassin running away in big steps. Knowing that he was not a good person, he chased him from behind while blowing the police whistle, following closely. When he fled to Hubei Road and turned into Guangdong Road, the Indian fired three shots but none of them hit.</p>
<p>Grabbing the Assassin; and Firing</p>
<p>At that time, the assassin held a gun and fired a shot to resist arrest. Because the bullet was stuck, he could not fire. Before long, when he crossed to the front of the Zheng Yu Xiang cigarette and paper shop at No. 89, the intersection of Guangdong Road and Fujian Road, Huabu No. 454 of the Chengdu Road Police Station was passing by the scene, witnessed everything, and bravely stepped forward, hugged him around the waist and pushed him to the ground. The Indian policeman who followed him then caught up and fired a shot, one hitting his right thumb and one shooting his buttocks. The gun he was holding was obtained by the Huabu.</p>
<p>Named Li Dingmo; Employed in the Bank</p>
<p>When the ambulance was called, the injured criminal was sent to the police hospital for treatment. According to the confession, his name is He Fengxiang, 23 years old, wearing a black striped serge gown. As for the body, the Zhongnan accountant reported it to the Old Zha Police Station, and it was sent to Renji Hospital by the hearse for examination at the mortuary. It is reported that the deceased's name is Li Dingmo, 41 years old, from Jiangyin, and works in the banking sector.</p>

<h3>Rice Prices Soar Again Yesterday: Speculation Pushes Operating Rice Prices Higher; Rectifying the Rice Market Can No Longer Be Delayed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market was chaotic under the manipulation of speculators. Absurd rumors emerged one after another, causing the price per picul to soar by three or four yuan compared to last week. After the illegal elements traded privately in the afternoon, the price was raised by one or so yuan, resulting in a sharp increase of four or five yuan in one day yesterday.</p>
<p>Disregarding Price Limits</p>
<p>It was found that last week, the authorities issued an order that Saigon rice should not exceed 124 yuan per picul, but yesterday the black market price reached 132 or 3 yuan, exceeding the limit by 8 or 9 yuan. The authorities' price limit order is still prominently displayed in the market, but the general rice worms turn a blind eye. The food problem is becoming more and more serious. If urgent and strict measures are not taken immediately, it will have a great impact on the security of the wood market. It is hoped that the authorities and the relevant aspects will pay close attention to it. According to a message from a rice shop, the shop received a notification from Saigon counterparts yesterday, saying that "new goods are on the market, harvesting is abundant, ordering has begun, and there is no need to worry about being blocked in the future." It can be seen that the rice market is rumored to be inaccurate.</p>
<p>Speculating and Operating</p>
<p>According to the investigation, the city's rice reserves are over one million bags, and the reserves in Japanese rice warehouses and rice shops and factories are more than 700,000 bags, which is enough for half a year. Most of these rice are one or two months of imported goods, with very low costs. If they are sold at the official price limit, the profit will be very considerable, but it is still not enough to satisfy their desires, and they are repeatedly raising the price, causing the current serious situation. And in terms of sources, there are 20,000 to 30,000 bags arriving in Shanghai every day. At present, what should be implemented urgently is (1) prohibiting non-rice shops from searching for spot goods in the market, because the current transaction in the rice market is mostly speculative, and prices are raised as a result (2) shortening business hours, because if business hours are long, the rumors spread by these people can play a great role in the market, and it is especially necessary to immediately and effectively prohibit private trading in the miscellaneous grain market in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Psychologist Bin Comes to Shanghai to Perform, Predicting the End of the Sino-Japanese War</h3>
<p>Dutch psychologist Sylvain Boekedinber, one of the world's four most famous psychologists, will soon perform psychic magic at 94 Jing'an Temple Road, such as clairvoyance, plum blossom divination, overnight divination, telepathy, and blind driving, and can also perform all kinds of amazing performances on the spirit and soul. Mr. Boekedinber is willing to perform all kinds of magical techniques free of charge at press banquets or other grand banquet seats. Mr. Boekedinber comes from</p>
<p>Java to Shanghai</p>
<p>and is as famous as the European and German psychic Eric Jan Hanussen and the Viennese psychic Ranael Shermann. Mr. Hanussen was killed by Hitler's men in Germany because he knew the past, future, and the psychology of the masses, and Mr. Shermann's whereabouts are also unknown.</p>
<p>The Future Outcome of the European War</p>
<p>is something that politicians do not want prophets to announce. Mr. Boekedinber claims to be born knowing, but some say that he is proficient in psychology and that he can make scientific judgments and decisions on all mental expressions of human behavior and actions. Chinese electrical engineer Fan Fengyuan has recently studied</p>
<p>Animal Magnetism</p>
<p>and the famous Japanese psychic Akisue Myeongdeung (Ienicho Auivama) both believe that the human body itself has a kind of magnetism for the spirit and soul, and this kind of magnetism can have strong expressions for men and women, or during sleep, dreams, or fear, and that each person's sleep every night is a way to restore the inherent state of human magnetism, so sleep can alleviate the condition, and by</p>
<p>Psychological Effects</p>
<p>it is possible to reduce mental illness or other diseases, and by the three powers of the mind, one is understanding (Under Standing), the second is reasoning (Reasoning), and the third is imagination (Imagination,) gathering them together, one can guess all the future good and bad, but ordinary people often do not use "understanding" and "reasoning" to help "imagination" when guessing future events,</p>
<p>Side by Side, Abandoned Driving</p>
<p>therefore, the results of guessing are often not very accurate. Mr. Boekedinber said that the Sino-Japanese War is about to end, and that the Chinese people's unity and national belief are that Chairman Jiang is the highest aspiration, and that this psychological power of the masses is enough to cope with everything.</p>
<h3>The Four Banks and the Police Department Negotiate Security Issues: Dismissal of Bank of China Employees Said to Be Inaccurate</h3>
<p>According to well-informed sources yesterday, the four banks of Zhongzhong Jiaonong will resume operations soon, but the exact date has not yet been announced. As for the rumor that 70 employees of the Bank of China resigned, employees of the bank said that this rumor is not based on facts. It is said that even if a few employees resign, it is not a special circumstance, because the entry and exit of bank employees is a very normal thing. It is also said that the bank is currently negotiating protection issues with the police authorities. Once this negotiation is completed, the four banks will resume operations.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Instructs to Resume Operations as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>Reuters Chongqing, 21st: Xu Kan of the Ministry of Finance said that the Ministry of Finance has instructed the four banks in Shanghai to resume operations as soon as possible, and the government authorities have prepared methods to protect the employees of the four banks. Mr. Xu also pointed out the importance of economic warfare in the war in China and that the government's banks decided to operate in Shanghai until the absolute impossibility. He also said that the government's attitude toward the Shanghai banks will depend on the subsequent developments.</p>
<h3>HSBC Annual Meeting Report: The General Trend of Commerce and Finance in the Far East</h3>
<p>The Chinese Government's Maintenance of Currency Integrity is a Remarkable Achievement; Various Countries' Loans and Economic Aid to China are Quite Satisfactory</p>
<p>The British HSBC Bank held its annual meeting in Hong Kong on February 26, 1941. Chairman Hon. lr. J.I. Paterson reported on the bank's business in 1940 and the general trend of commerce and finance in the Far East. The following is an excerpt of the original text obtained by the reporter of the New Voice News Agency:</p>
<p>Shanghai-Hong Kong Business: Continued Progress</p>
<p>The development of the Far Eastern situation coincides with the predictions of prudent observers two or three years ago. Obstacles have arisen, and business has been greatly affected. However, optimists can certainly claim that business has not been as bad as the political developments predicted. Pessimists and optimists each have their reasons. If you recall the speeches of previous chairmen, you will be surprised by the frequent use of gloomy phrases such as "unprecedented difficulties," "reversing the situation," "extraordinary state," and "uncertain future." However, if you have several years of experience living in the Far East, and you compare the current business and shipping in Hong Kong and Shanghai with the situation twenty or thirty years ago, you will find that both Hong Kong and Shanghai are still able to maintain a trend of continued progress.</p>
<p>Emergency Aid to China: Quite Satisfactory</p>
<p>The only unhealthy thing is most obvious, that is, last year, Shanghai imported a large number of native products, most of which can be supplied in normal times, such as rice, cotton, coal, tobacco, sugar, flour, and rayon. The total quantity and value of these imports have greatly increased compared to 1936. In that year, the total value of these imports accounted for only 13% of the total imports, but in 1940, it increased to 51%. On the export side, it was also affected by foreign forces, resulting in serious consequences for the trade balance. However, China continues to receive various loans from foreign countries to meet the needs of currency security and currency management measures, which is quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>Maintaining Currency Integrity: A Remarkable Achievement</p>
<p>Last year, the Shanghai foreign exchange market's highest rate in January was 4 and 32/29 pence for British gold and 8 and 1/16 for US dollars. The lowest in May was 3 pence and 4 and 32/31. The city fluctuated between these two numbers. The exchange rate at the end of the year was 3 and 1/1 pence and 5 and 2/1 US dollars. The balance exchange fund continued to perform balancing work when necessary. Looking at the export trade in non-occupied areas and occupied areas, most of it is under control, it can be called a miracle that the national currency price can be maintained with few difficulties.</p>
<p>Repaying Foreign Debt According to Legal Rates</p>
<p>China's customs revenue is often praised by those who have not carefully studied the actual situation. Although the figure reached 47.5 million legal currency, it is only worth 7.75 million pounds based on the average exchange rate of the year. In contrast, the previous year's income was only 33.1 million legal currency, which is equal to 8.25 million pounds. However, in the ten years before the Sino-Japanese War, the annual average was no less than 19 million pounds. In addition, due to the continuation of the Sino-Japanese War, the foreign debt market conditions last year could not improve. For the customs surplus and salt surplus loans, the National Government has ordered the Central Bank to repay them at the stipulated exchange rate. The funds allocated for repaying foreign debts are calculated at the initial legal exchange rate of one shilling and two and a quarter pence.</p>
<p>Mr. Maze Supervises Customs</p>
<p>According to the estimate of the previous chairman, the customs surplus deposit of the Yokohama Specie Bank reached 380 million yuan. At present, the figure should have doubled. If the Yokohama Specie Bank releases the exchange rate stipulated by the Chinese government, this is indeed a problem of exchange, that is, how to obtain the required foreign exchange. In any case, the foreign debts issued before the incident cannot be denied. Therefore, this exchange problem cannot be solved by either China or the customs surplus authorities in the occupied areas. It can only be hoped that the world will return to normal. What the bondholders belong to is that Sir Frederick Maze, the Inspector General of Customs, continues to supervise the customs administration. Fortunately, the achievements are remarkable, and there is no doubt that there will be more achievements in the future when peace is restored.</p>
<p>Restoring Normal Times to Recover Debts</p>
<p>Among China's various railway loans, the Beining Railway (i.e., the 1899 Jingfeng Railway Gold Public Debt) is still able to repay on time, and the operating income is quite good. The Northeast authorities have difficulty obtaining remittances. Although British employees are paid as usual, they are undoubtedly treated poorly and therefore very dissatisfied. The progress in western China is the initial construction of the Kunming-Northwest Railway, but due to the isolation of the Yunnan-Vietnam transportation, this only route for transporting heavy materials has been interrupted. The Xiang-Gui Railway in Hengyang and the western section of the Longhai Line are under construction. The railways under the jurisdiction of Japanese companies are the Central China Company in the Jiangnan area and the North China Company in the Hebei area. It seems that traffic is normal and there is some income. However, bondholders will probably not be able to recover their debts until the political situation returns to normal.</p>
<p>We Hope to Maintain Order</p>
<p>Since the mainland restricted the transportation of the main food and other native products of the Chinese people to Shanghai, this is a negative factor for the decline in foreign exchange, which suddenly raised the living standard by 50% compared to January 1940. The price of rice increased by 120%, and compared to the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, it increased sharply by 600%. Therefore, naturally, the cost of all goods has increased, and expenditures must also increase, putting the finances of the Public Works Department in a difficult situation. I am afraid that the fundamental solution to the Shanghai problem can only be achieved when the political problems in the Far East are resolved. What we hope for at present is only that all humanitarians maintain peace and order to protect the lives and safety of the citizens of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Shooting at Ewo Cotton Mill: Many Workers Injured</h3>
<p>At the Ewo Cotton Mill in Yangshupu, a strike occurred because the coolie workers demanded a pay raise from manager Davis, which was not granted, resulting in a shooting incident by the police. On the day the incident occurred, the workers went to work as usual in the early morning and were immediately driven away and beaten by the police. The workers immediately seized the iron rods in their hands and fought back, causing a British policeman to have several teeth knocked out. The policeman was furious and summoned more than 200 policemen to surround the factory. Seeing the impending disaster, the workers begged for release but were still shot. For a time, there was a loud commotion, and more than 20 workers were slightly injured. The seriously injured were sent to the police hospital. The coolie workers did not hold iron rods in a group to fight, nor did they coerce other workers to strike. They are now appealing to all sectors of society to uphold justice and provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Ms. Wu Leyi: Piano Recital</h3>
<p>Ms. Wu Leyi, a famous Chinese piano expert (pictured), excelled in music from a young age. At the age of seven, she had already performed for the public and was admired by society.

Ms. Wu has decided to hold a personal piano recital at the Lyceum Theatre at 9:15 pm on Friday, April 25. The proceeds from the tickets, after deducting expenses, will be donated to charity. It is said that those who buy tickets and reserve seats are very enthusiastic. People from all walks of life who wish to buy tickets and reserve seats can contact the Lyceum Theatre or Moutrie's Music Store on Nanjing Road.</p>
<h3>Hand Grenade Injures Four Children Inside the Cilian Women and Children's Shelter</h3>
<p>The shelter houses about 1,250 women and children, and Wei Huahai is the director. At 10 am yesterday, seven boys from the shelter were playing in the open space inside the shelter when suddenly something resembling a hand grenade exploded with a deafening noise. Four children were injured on the spot. The injured include Tang Jinxiu (14 years old), a boy from Anhui, injured in the face; Chuan Liangfa (11 years old), a boy from Guangdong, injured in the buttocks; Dai Xuesheng (9 years old), a boy from Anhui, injured in the left foot; and He Guocheng (11 years old), a local boy, injured in the head and feet. Afterwards, they were rushed to the refugee hospital for treatment. The Public Concession Police Station was informed and immediately sent personnel to investigate. After investigation, it was found that the injury was caused by a bomb. It is likely that the children in the shelter picked it up outside and did not recognize it as a dangerous item, which led to the disaster.</p>

<h3>Sino-Western Cup Table Tennis Tournament: Hualian Defeats the YWCA</h3>
<p>In the Sino-Western Cup table tennis tournament, Hualian played against the YWCA in the women's group last night in the YWCA auditorium. The former was the champion of the previous year. This year, the strength has been greatly affected due to the retirement of the main player Liang Yujie. However, in the first battle against the Jewish team, they suffered a disastrous defeat due to the incomplete team. In the final against Sucor, they actually gave up the game. Yesterday against Hualian, the main players Zhang Jiazhen and Wang Guangmei were not present. Therefore, in the battle, they initially took the lead with a score of 5-2, but were eventually gradually chased up by Hualian and were defeated with a score of 10-13. There will be three more battles tonight. The order is recorded below.</p>

<h3>How to Study Physics (II)</h3>
<p>— Xu Ziwei</p>
<p>(3) Pay attention to after-class review "Daily study will not be forgotten", "Review the old and know the new" are ancient lessons. If the knowledge we have learned in class is not reviewed at any time after class, it will inevitably become unfamiliar. And physics is a science with continuity. If the things learned before are wasted day by day, when you learn the places where there is contact later, it is undoubtedly going to be difficult to understand. Moreover, since physics is a very difficult subject to understand, the knowledge gained in class may not be completely without doubts and incomprehensibility. If it is not after a review after class, it will be impossible to know what is understood and what is not yet clear, then you need to ask. Many honest people often feel that physics becomes more and more difficult to read. In fact, this is not entirely true. Most of it is due to the lack of review, which makes the previous ones not proficient, and thus this effect occurs.</p>
<p>(4) Develop the habit of asking questions Learning and asking questions go hand in hand. "Asking good questions will lead to wealth" and "Not being ashamed to ask questions" are ancient lessons to encourage learning and asking questions. Since physics is very difficult to understand, even if we can listen attentively in class and refer widely after class, there will inevitably be many difficulties and uncertainties. To solve these problems, the only way is to ask questions, either to ask teachers or to learn from each other with classmates. You must ask for details without being impatient, and strive to achieve a thorough understanding. If you do not ask questions, the teacher does not know where the reader does not understand, and the reader cannot solve what he does not understand. Therefore, when studying physics, you should ask questions immediately when you encounter difficulties and uncertainties. Do not be afraid to ask questions, do not be impatient to ask questions, and develop the habit of asking questions.</p>
<p>(5) Detailed explanation of the practice questions Practice questions are necessary to assist learning, increase the degree of understanding, and inspire and train thinking. Many physics problems seem difficult and incomprehensible at first glance, but if you think about them, you can solve them easily. Therefore, when practicing physics problems, you must think and consider in many ways. You should not ask questions immediately if you feel you do not understand something. Drawing a diagram can make the content of the problem clear and guide thinking to a clear analytical path. Therefore, it is best to draw a simple diagram first to help you think when explaining some physics problems. If you encounter a problem that is extremely difficult to solve, it is best to flip through reference books first, always focusing on automatic solving. As for the convenience of reading, the explanation should be detailed, the calculation should be accurate, and the writing should be clear. There is no need to say this.</p>

<h3>Longevity</h3>
<p>— Xiao Yun</p>
<p>Clinging to life and fearing death is perhaps an inherent human trait. The ancient dictator Qin Shi Huang's quest for the elixir of immortality can be said to represent humanity's desire for life. It is said that the modern dictator Mussolini was also very afraid of aging. He disliked people mentioning his birthday and forbade newspapers from publishing news of his grandson's birth, and he often performed horseback riding and jumping to show that he was not old. If these rumors are true, then it is probably a case of "great minds think alike."</p>
<p>Recently, Dr. D. W. Malisoff of Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in the United States announced that human lifespan has the potential to increase to one hundred and eighty-five years. He is currently experimenting with a chemical called Sodium thioeyate to feed rabbits, and it is said that it can already overcome the signs of aging in rabbits because this chemical has the function of breaking down cholesterol in the rabbits' bodies. According to him, cholesterol is a waxy substance in human blood vessels, and the older a person is, the more cholesterol they have in their blood vessels. If we can break down cholesterol in the human body, human lifespan may be extended.</p>
<p>At a time when most of the globe is covered in the flames of war, when most countries are mired in a state of war, when militaristic aggressors are doing their best to shorten the lives of most young people with artillery and bombs, scientists are diligently engaged in research to extend human life. What a deeply ironic picture!</p>
<p>Although the world is shrouded in gloom, the dawn of scientific progress is constantly and secretly strengthening. It's just that humans must learn from historical lessons, must make good use of science, and must also make good use of their lifespan.</p>

<h3>Dr. Banting is Dead</h3>
<p>— Mo Ming</p>
<p>On February 21, 1941, a scientific giant fell along with a wrecked giant plane near Mouse Grave Port on the east coast of Newfoundland. This giant was the famous Dr. F. G. Banting—the medical scientist who discovered insulin, the re-parents of diabetics worldwide, a true benefactor of humanity.</p>
<p>His tragic news shocked every corner of the world, causing millions of diabetic sufferers to cover their faces and weep. Twenty years ago, Dr. Banting buried himself in hard work at the graduate school of the University of Toronto in Canada, wanting to extract an endocrine hormone essential for consuming blood sugar—insulin—from the "Islets of Langerhans" in the animal pancreas. After countless resolute failures, his painstaking efforts finally achieved unprecedented success. In 1922, the insulin prepared by Dr. Banting was first formally tested on a dying child, and thus the first diabetic patient in human history was saved by human power. Banting's name shook the world like his tragic news today; doctors praised, patients rejoiced. His immortal achievements quickly gained the highest evaluation and respect—he and his teacher Professor J. J. R. Macleod shared the 1923 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.</p>
<p>Dr. Banting was an outstanding surgeon, but he had a deeper love for basic medicine in all departments. His thirst for knowledge was endless, and he had amazing talent and abundant energy to overcome any difficulties in research. Membership and honorary membership in twenty-one scientific groups around the world, eleven academic awards and medals, honorary doctorates from five famous universities—these many glorious records became a symbol of his greatness and success. The Canadian government also specially granted him an annual salary of seven thousand five hundred yuan from 1923 to show the country's rewards and recognition of scientists' meritorious service. But Dr. Banting was indifferent to fame and wealth. He voluntarily shared the Nobel Prize money with Dr. C. H. Best, who conducted research on insulin with him, and donated the US$10,000 he received to the "Banting Medical Research Fund" to establish a "Banting Research Institute" to broadly launch the research work of progressive medicine. There is no "enterprise" in the world more meaningful than this kind of "investment." Its "interest" is shared by people around the world and permanently shared by our descendants for generations to come.</p>
<p>Dr. Banting was a worldly scientist who constantly remembered the suffering masses, and he loved his motherland and human justice. During the First World War, he risked his life on the battlefield, doing arduous service work for the wounded soldiers. After the outbreak of the current European war, he was ordered to focus on the study of aviation medicine. However, when he was on his way to England with a major military mission, he unfortunately died. We cannot but recognize that he was indirectly killed by the flames of aggression. He was only fifty years old, a promising prime of life! This is truly a major blow and loss to humanity.</p>
<p>We must commemorate Dr. Banting by carrying out the work of benefiting the people. Here are a few of his famous sayings as our motto: "The human heart can never be satisfied, otherwise the world will stop progressing. The greatest joy in life is work. It should be obtaining, not possessing; it should be discarding, not conserving. I believe you can do anything you hope for, provided you have the determination to sacrifice, you can think, and you can work hard and constantly."</p>
<h3>Hope</h3>

<p>Family</p>
<h3>Resentful Complaint</h3>
<p>— Yi Zhi</p>
<p>Recently, Mother has been paying close attention to Father, whether he is smoking, walking, sitting, or standing, everything seems to make her angry. She seems dissatisfied with everything about Father, sulking all day long, just like a bitter enemy, unwilling to let go for a moment.</p>
<p>Father, who is usually very tolerant, can endure anything, but Mother's urgency also makes him furious.</p>
<p>Every day, the two often quarrel over a small matter, and as a result, Mother always sleeps in bed crying, and Father sighs.</p>
<p>Everything always leads to the problem of eating. "Eating" is the main reason for the two's quarrel.</p>
<p>"The price of rice is rising day by day, and we have to worry about how to fill our stomachs, and we still have to resent this complaint. I said long ago, sooner or later we will all starve to death!"</p>
<p>"You have a good heart, only hoping that everyone will starve... You will be a hundred times uncomfortable if you have no smoke to smoke for a few days..."</p>
<p>"Unless you come to gnaw on my old bones!"</p>
<p>"You little thief, loafing around all day long. People always think of ways outside, but you just lazily pace back and forth at home!..." Whenever the two quarrel, older brother becomes Father's outlet for venting his anger.</p>
<p>"Are you envious of others? Our ancestors didn't do evil, and it won't come to the point of selling our ancestors..."</p>
<p>"You discipline well, you teach your sons well. I am this old, I should be enjoying my blessings, but now I want to eat, I want to smoke..."</p>
<p>"He hasn't done anything thieving, hasn't done anything stealing...! He won't disgrace you. If the old don't lead, who will tell the young to go around recklessly? The old don't know shame!"</p>
<p>"The old are useless! They want them to find food for me to eat." He slammed the table, his eyes about to burst into flames.</p>
<p>Then, Mother timidly sheds tears—cries.</p>
<p>The two don't speak to each other for several days, but Mother secretly continues to pay attention to Father, and as soon as she catches a gap, they quarrel again.</p>
<p>Ah, once Father was planting a garden, Mother was leading the children, older brother was managing the business that Father handed over, and I was attending school. My home was a harmonious and cheerful paradise. Who forcibly occupied the homeland, who robbed the business, who stirred up conflicts between parents? Now, harmony and joy are far, far away from my home, gone without a trace, only filled with darkness and sorrow.</p>
<p>With my utmost effort, I believe that the lost harmony and joy will soon be pursued and brought back by me.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(7) A Cross Scratched on the Face</p>
<p>As soon as Qiu Haitang saw him, half of his body turned cold involuntarily. Although he had followed Xiangqi's instructions last month when he went to Tianjin and tried his best to refuse his demands, he had added a very big worry to his heart. He knew that this fellow, whose nature was dangerous and tenacious, like a poisonous snake, would never let him go. Although Xiangqi said in his letter that he would soon have the opportunity to speak to Yuan Baofan, asking him to stop Ji Zhaoxiong, and also warned him not to lend money to Ji Zhaoxiong again under any circumstances, as soon as that face with only skin and no flesh appeared, Qiu Haitang's heart immediately turned cold.</p>
<p>"... I haven't been on... on... stage for a long time... and I'm... I'm... also very short on funds myself...!" He put down the newspaper in his hand and said with a forced stammer.</p>
<p>With a single turn of Ji Zhaoxiong's triangular eyes, he knew that Qiu Haitang was a little timid. At the same time, he really needed money too much these days, so he decided to disregard everything and make a tough attempt on him for once.</p>
<p>"Don't lie in front of a real man, Boss Wu!" In just a second, his face had turned iron-blue, and he changed to an extremely tough tone. "As the saying goes, give convenience to others, and you'll get convenience yourself. Don't underestimate me, Ji Zhaoxiong. To be honest, asking you to borrow money is still being polite. If you provoke me, even if you wrap me up in banknotes, I won't regard you as a person!"</p>
<p>This time, Ji Zhaoxiong's calculation was completely wrong. What Qiu Haitang feared most in his life was people pestering him with a completely soft and shameless manner. Like this kind of hard collision, the result would instead arouse his stubbornness.</p>
<p>"You're being too impolite!" The head that was originally lowered suddenly raised up, and the eyes directly looked at Ji Zhaoxiong. "Don't say I don't owe you money. Even if I do owe it, I can't pay you if you treat me like this!" (87)</p>

<h3>It's Never Too Late to Learn</h3>
<p>— Lan Yu</p>
<p>Cato began to learn Greek at the age of eighty. Socrates learned to play musical instruments when he was very old. Plutarch began learning Latin between the ages of seventy and eighty. Dr. Johnson learned Dutch a few years before his death. Ludivieo Monaldwsco wrote a chronicle of the major events of the time at the age of one hundred and fifteen. Ogilby didn't understand Latin and Greek until after the age of fifty. Franklin did not engage in science research until before the age of fifty. Dryden was sixty years old when he made his most satisfactory translation, "Aeneid". Baccaccio began studying simple literature at the age of thirty, but he later became one of the three great writers of the "Tuscan Language". The other two of these three authors were Dante and Petrarch.</p>

<p>New Film Introduction</p>
<h3>"The Philadelphia Story"</h3>
<p>— Deng Shiying</p>
<p>In terms of story, "The Philadelphia Story" is one of the "romantic comedies" that Hollywood produced in large quantities last year. Seeing this type of story once in a while may spark some interest, but seeing it too much will become boring. What's more, screenwriters have different skills. With more and more films of the same type, there is comparison. In comparison, heights become immediately apparent, so it is even more difficult. So far, only "The Awful Truth" has left a deeper impression on people among the so-called "romantic comedies," and that is why. However, "The Philadelphia Story" also has its ways of attracting attention. This is none other than the actors. Katharine Hepburn has been away from us for a long time. Although this person is not beautiful, the photo stars are far inferior to her when it comes to acting; James Stewart gave a very good impression in films such as "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" in the past, and this film won him the Academy Award for Best Actor this year, so it is inevitable that people will pay attention to him even more. Cary Grant has appeared in films such as "The Awful Truth," so he is an old hand at acting in "romantic comedies," and of course we have to take a look at him too.</p>
<p>After watching it, I felt that Katharine Hepburn was good, but not strong enough. "Romantic comedy" is not very harmonious with her, not open enough and not hot enough; James Stewart's "affectionate fool" look is still the same. Although it is said that the unified control of the character is very strong (which may be the reason for winning the Academy Award), it is its commendable point, but I still feel that the work for which he won the Academy Award should be "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" rather than this film. Cary Grant's impression is not as deep as in films such as "The Awful Truth" due to the script.</p>
<p>Speaking of the script, I feel that this film only has cleverness but is not substantial enough overall. Some wonderful points are in the dialogue rather than the visuals, which is not a very good method. "Romantic comedy" is indeed an accumulation of cleverness, but this should be like chemistry rather than arithmetic.</p>
<p>The director's merits and demerits are similar to those of the screenwriter. The small commendable point is the use of the camera. This kind of use of small props to act is also one of the characteristics of recent Hollywood films. In this film, it is used a lot, and most of them are very good. As for the drum sounds that are paired with Tracie Lorde's divorce at the beginning and the effects that are paired when Tracie gets drunk and goes to drink, it is also its clever point. This cartoon-like effect cannot be seen or heard in Chinese films.</p>
<h3>Scattered Notes on the Art Scene</h3>
<p>— Shou Yan</p>
<p>Some people call Lan Lan a boss lady. At first, I didn't understand why. Yesterday, I passed by her. According to her, she is going to open a teahouse. Then I suddenly understood. The location of the teahouse is upstairs from Mei Cun Candy Store next to Yiguang Grand Theater, specializing in Fujian dim sum, which is also quite novel. According to female actors in the theater world who open food stores, there was Wu Mei's "Mei Chong Zhen" before. Now Lan Lan has also become a boss lady. I wonder if anyone will follow suit in the future?</p>
<p>Six or seven groups, including the Hong Kong Baptist Middle School Deaf and Mute Society, have been visiting "Children of the World," a foreign-directed film, in crowds for days.</p>
<p>The wedding date of Diana Bowping and Feng Baoluo was originally set for June 7, but Haas wired the day before yesterday that Bowping finally "left child stardom and became a woman" on the 19th. A certain gentleman in the film industry said: It's a Date!</p>
<p>The position of publicity director of the Shanghai Drama and Art Society has been vacant for a long time since Mao Yu resigned. Recently, Wu Chongwen was appointed by Zhao Zhiyou, president of the society. Wu has been visiting various factional venues as a guest these days, just like the style of a "Beijing opera star."</p>
<h3>The Production of "Hong Xuanjiao"</h3>
<p>— Deng Xiao</p>
<p>There have been many reviews of the performance of "Hong Xuanjiao," and I will only briefly introduce it from the perspective of historical materials. The author, Wei Ruhui, is a writer and also a textual researcher, so his "Hong Xuanjiao" is based on historical facts everywhere. He probably collected a lot of newspapers and magazines from the late Qing Dynasty. Most of these have nationalistic ideas, and of course, there are many articles about the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. As for the biographical accounts of Xuanjiao that he mentioned, I have never seen a single one, and they are all rare. He has recently become very interested in "bibliography." The Cosmic Wind and Xue Lin either have or will have his articles of this type published. In that case, why not publish a catalog of the materials on which Hong Xuanjiao is based, just like the description of "Hero of the Seas"? For example, how to introduce the map of Jidaozhou Theater, Cheng Wenxiang's history revision, Gordon's meeting with Li Kaifang, and Chuan Sanxiang's articles are all valuable and interesting materials.</p>
<p>I know very little. The banners of the Four Kings, etc., in the first act seem to be based on Ling Shanqing's "Unofficial History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." The words on them were originally vertical, probably for the sake of the husband. The part about Hong Daquan seems to be based on Xie Yu and Rao's "Discussion on the Unofficial History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." The biography of Hong Daquan, the King of Heaven, contains the following: "After arriving in the capital, he was detained in the Ministry of Justice. The officials of the ministry interrogated him, but he stubbornly refused to tell the truth. When they spoke to him about the affairs of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, he would not say a word and was subsequently dismembered in the market." It also says: "When the Taiping Army first rose up, it seemed to be divided into two factions: the Ming restoration faction, led by Hong Daquan, and the Christian faction, led by Yang Xiuqing." According to the unofficial biography of Hong Daquan: "On the day of his execution, Daquan loudly recited the verse of the director's chamber: 'The Han people are all speaking the language of the barbarians, vying to scold the Han people from the city walls.'" This verse is from Tiankong Tu's seven-character quatrain "Feelings on the Hehuang," which originally read: "Ever since the war dust arose from Xiaoguan, Hehuang has been cut off from the spring of a foreign land. The Han people have learned the language of the barbarians, but they scold the Han people from the city walls." I was sitting in the last row and couldn't hear clearly, but it seemed that this poem was written by a Song and Yuan Dynasty literati; if I didn't hear it wrong, it seems that it should be corrected.</p>
<p>I couldn't see the couplet in the first act clearly because I was sitting too far away. Pages 61 and 62 of the unofficial history volume record the couplet. I don't know if it is based on this.</p>
<p>Li Xiucheng recited "Heroes have always shown their hearts and souls, brave men have never cherished their feathers!" in the fifth act. It is based on the famous sentence in Li's two poems on current events in Luo Yong et al.'s "Collection of Poems and Prose of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom."</p>
<p>I am very interested in this and hope that Ruhui can satisfy my request to list a catalog.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>Strongman Peng Fei has received widespread praise since filming "China Tarzan." Recently, in order to purchase film copies, he came to Shanghai from Hong Kong. Various film companies are vying to hire him. Because Peng Fei will self-fund the sequel to "Tarzan," he will go to Hong Kong soon, and it will be difficult to realize filming in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain Around the Altar</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Why Are the City Sieges and General Killings So Chaotic?</p>
<p>He still didn't know about the bandits on Green Stone Mountain, thinking that it was Li Xin's followers who were causing trouble. He walked outside, wanting to send someone to ask Youji Feng to bring troops to suppress them. Because after Shoubei Ma died in battle, a Youji Feng was replaced in the city. He had just taken office, and there were not many soldiers and horses, and his strength was still very weak, not enough to strengthen the city defenses. When the Qixian magistrate heard this news, he was so frightened that his face turned ashen. Trembling, he ran back to his room and woke up his beloved concubine, saying, "The Green Stone Mountain people and horses have entered the city. The Li family will definitely take revenge. Let's escape quickly." That concubine was also so frightened that she slumped to the ground. She put on her clothes and got out of bed, and said with a trembling voice, "Where can we escape to? And what about the many gold, silver, and jewels you have hidden? Are you willing to leave them behind?" The Qixian magistrate was reminded by his beloved concubine's words. He secretly thought that the fat and cream he had extracted from the common people through all kinds of means was also very hard-earned. If he didn't take it with him, wouldn't it be a pity? So he opened a large cabinet behind his bed. Many gold ingots and silver were piled up in the frame, shining brightly in yellow and white. However, this wooden cabinet was very bulky. How could he take 10,000 of gold and silver with him at once? He stared blankly at the gold and silver, unable to think of any idea. His beloved concubine took a jewelry box. The banquet box was full of jewelry and ornaments. She urged the Qixian magistrate, saying, "Let's go quickly! You hear that the voices outside are getting closer. There is also a fire rising in the east. My heart is almost broken with fear." The Qixian magistrate rubbed his hands and said, "How can I transport so much gold and silver out? It's better to call a few runners to help me take it away." The concubine said, "If you ask them to take it, I'm afraid they won't be reliable." The Qixian magistrate had no way to think. He was sweating profusely and jumping his feet, saying, "I usually only care about setting up hiding places, thinking that I can use them to build a retirement home and pass them on to my children and grandchildren in the future. Who knew that I would not be able to protect them today. What should I do!" While the Qixian magistrate was in a panic, Li Xin and Hong Niangzi and others had arrived and stormed into the room. The Qixian magistrate had nowhere to hide for a while. He locked himself under the bed. Li Xin had already seen it. He shouted, "Dog official, where are you escaping to? I, Li Xin, will not spare you." He bent down and reached under the bed and dragged the Qixian magistrate out. The beloved concubine was also captured by Hong Niangzi. (44)</p>
<h3>Summary of the Philosophy of Diligent Practice</h3>
<p>— Zong Yu</p>
<p>The philosophy of diligent practice emphasizes practice and especially emphasizes diligence. If one practices without diligence, its effect will not be obvious. If others are advancing rapidly, while one walks slowly alone, the distance will increase day by day, and one will still inevitably be defeated. How can one practice in a way that counts as diligent? Of course, one must adopt a fighting approach.</p>
<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>— Jue Xin</p>
<p>Kun Dan Jin Yanxia, who was properly arranged to dance in the Tianchan Theater, returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon. After resting for a day, she will join the performance of the fourteen-episode Golden Dart Huang Tianba. The role she plays was originally rushed by Zhuan Su-lan from the first floor of the Xian Shi Paradise Theater, but now that Jin Yanxia has returned, she is still the main pillar in Paradise, so there is no problem.</p>
<p>Xun Huisheng has finished performing at the Gengxin Stage and will return to the Golden Grand Theater to sing for twelve days. Because Gai Huitian is ill and is recuperating in Renji Hospital, the Golden Grand Theater has no roles to perform. Since Xi Xiaobo and Hou Yulan cannot arrive in time, this plan has been internally decided. According to reports, Gai Huitian's condition has improved after receiving a blood transfusion in the hospital.</p>
